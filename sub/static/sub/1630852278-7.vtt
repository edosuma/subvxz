WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:04.629
- Eddie, you all right?

00:07.132 --> 00:08.758
- Joon-Ho wants his money.

00:08.758 --> 00:10.593
-
- And don't make us come back,

00:10.593 --> 00:12.721
because next time probably
won't be as fun as this.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.018
- And that's a pinky promise.

00:20.603 --> 00:23.606
- Yo, Ed?
Ed?

00:23.606 --> 00:25.942
- Fuck, you guys.
I need some help!

00:27.861 --> 00:31.990
♪ Now, now,
now, now, now ♪

00:35.493 --> 00:36.953
- How's it going, Ed?

00:36.953 --> 00:39.956
- I'm dizzy, man.
I'm fucking dying.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.708
- Look, you're not dying, all
right? We'll be there in eight
minutes.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.710
- What? No!

00:43.710 --> 00:45.920
Fingers--fingers can't go
that long without breathing.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.505
- No, no.
You're thinking of fish.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.466
Fingers don't breathe.
They just bleed out.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.926
It takes a little bit
longer, but--but--
but--you're--you're good, man.

00:51.926 --> 00:54.220
- Look, but it got, like,
dirt and shit all over.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.513
What if it's ruined, man?

00:55.513 --> 00:57.390
- Look, all right?
It's not ruined.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.892
We're gonna go.
They'll rinse it off.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.603
And they'll...sew it back on.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.104
- Oh, there's a veterinary
hospital right there.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.190
Pull in. - Yeah, if you want
your nuts cut off.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.567
All right, we gotta go
to a human hospital

01:07.567 --> 01:10.070
where they know how to sew
fucking fingers back on, Hal.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.405
- Hey, all right-- - No, we
gotta put this thing on ice!

01:12.405 --> 01:14.866
- Uh--oh, we got Billy
Miner's pub up the street.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.326
They got fucking ice.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.047
- Just stay calm, Eddie,
all right? Keep breathing.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.965
Just like that.
Keep breathing.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.258
Keep it above your heart.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.262
- What?
- You gotta go in, man.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.723
The sign says no shirt,
no shoes, no service.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.683
- Did you tell them that we have
a guy bleeding to death out
here?

01:40.683 --> 01:41.768
- Well, no. I didn't go
in 'cause of the sign.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.229
- Wait, am I bleeding to death?

01:44.229 --> 01:46.022
- Hal, if you don't get your
fucking ass in that pub right
now.

01:46.022 --> 01:47.690
- Okay, all right, all right,
all right. - Get the ice!

01:47.690 --> 01:49.609
- I am dying, aren't I?

01:49.609 --> 01:51.444
- No, no, no, no, no.
Dude, you cannot die

01:51.444 --> 01:52.529
from getting your finger
cut off, all right?

01:52.529 --> 01:54.030
But what the fuck happened?

01:54.030 --> 01:56.116
- These--these guys.
There was two of them.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.408
They just--they--they
jumped me, man.

01:57.408 --> 01:59.119
- These guys?
Who?

01:59.119 --> 02:02.288
- Fuck, these drug
dealers my brother owes money
to.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.792
- Look, I got some
boys up in Vice.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.168
We can get these
fuckers today, Eddie.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.212
- No, no, no, no cops, please.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.464
Please, my--my mom, she-- she's
trying to sell the company.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.299
And this--this is
bad press, okay?

02:13.299 --> 02:14.676
It'll--it'll fuck the deal.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.761
And just please no cops--no.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.304
- Fuck, man.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.598
- Hey, put the finger in here.

02:20.598 --> 02:21.683
You want me to hold the glass,
or you got it?

02:21.683 --> 02:23.184
What? No.
Gimme--give me that. Gimme.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.943
- Hang in there, Eddie, all
right? We'll be there soon.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.156
- Uh, why does this ice stink?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.783
- Hal, why does the ice stink?

02:38.783 --> 02:40.994
- Okay, I tried to order
a vodka on the rocks,

02:40.994 --> 02:43.329
but the guy wouldn't serve me
'cause of the no-shirt thing.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.082
I even told him he was bleeding
to death, like you said.

02:46.082 --> 02:48.877
- Why would you order a vodka?
I told you to get plain ice.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.503
- I--I know.
I figured the vodka

02:50.503 --> 02:51.963
would kill the
bacteria on the finger,

02:51.963 --> 02:53.673
but I mean, the
bartender, he's--

02:53.673 --> 02:55.175
He's a fucking prick, man.
I mean, he didn't even care.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.218
He wouldn't--

02:57.218 --> 02:58.761
- Is that a urinal cake?

02:58.761 --> 03:00.388
- Uh...

03:00.388 --> 03:01.472
Okay, look, it might
be a urinal cake.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.641
- What--is my pinky in piss ice?

03:03.641 --> 03:05.768
- I forgot to mention that,
but yeah, it is, okay.

03:05.768 --> 03:07.687
- Are you fucking kidding me?
Dude!

03:07.687 --> 03:09.814
- I'm sorry, okay?
You didn't drink that, did you?

03:09.814 --> 03:12.025
- What? No, I didn't drink it!
My finger's in there!

03:12.025 --> 03:13.401
- Okay, it's fine, all right?
Urine is sterile!

03:13.401 --> 03:14.444
- I'm gonna fucking
kill you, man.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.695
- Urine is sterile!
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.322
- Fuck!

03:17.322 --> 03:19.616
- You put his fucking
pinky in piss ice!

03:19.616 --> 03:21.826
- It was an emergency--
- What is wrong with you?

03:21.826 --> 03:23.620
- I didn't want to.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.455
It wasn't my Plan A.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.916
I had to think fast.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.385
- Hey, guys.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.262
- Dude.
- Whoa.

03:41.262 --> 03:43.765
- What the hell did they do to
you? It's been almost 24 hours.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.308
- Yeah, man,
I thought you died in there.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.477
- Uh, yeah,
sewing on a pinky's no joke.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.771
They had like ten people
working on this little fucker.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.106
- Oh.
- So it's--it's on?

03:52.106 --> 03:53.608
- Oh, yeah.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.152
- Looks pretty on.
- I mean, is it fine?

03:56.152 --> 03:58.029
- I don't know.
We'll see.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.156
They, uh--they said in a week
I'll know if it's somewhat
functional,

04:00.156 --> 04:02.200
or totally not functional.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.701
- Oh, my God.

04:03.701 --> 04:05.787
- Can you still keep it
if it's totally not functional?

04:05.787 --> 04:08.456
- Why would he keep it?

04:08.456 --> 04:10.208
- Appearances.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.919
S-shadow puppets.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.172
- So--so they said you--you
could just go? How do you feel?

04:16.172 --> 04:18.383
- Yeah, no.
Pretty--pretty damn good.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.677
They--they got me all hopped up
on Vicodin or some shit.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.470
Like I was singing
with the nurses.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.973
And I, uh--I actually think
I made a phone call

04:24.973 --> 04:27.517
and arranged a business dinner
for tonight at Juniper

04:27.517 --> 04:29.269
with Double Decker Becker.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.562
- Ooh. It's Upper-Decker
Becker, though.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.064
- Yeah.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.190
- What?
No, no, you said--

04:34.190 --> 04:36.109
- I know.
We--we discussed it,

04:36.109 --> 04:39.362
and I was wrong, so, from
now on, Upper-Decker Becker.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.281
- Yeah, oh, this is your shirt.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.657
- Oh, great.
Thank you, man.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.325
- Yeah, yeah.
- I really wanted this back.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.789
- So, yeah, I guess
the lesson is,

04:49.789 --> 04:51.291
if you drop something
down the garbage disposal,

04:51.291 --> 04:53.001
you gotta let that shit go.

04:53.001 --> 04:56.546
- Yeah, I guess so.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.131
I've been dying
to try this place.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.590
I'm so happy you
got a reservation.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.426
- Yeah, no, I-I didn't get one.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.636
- What?

05:03.636 --> 05:05.471
You said you were gonna
make a reservation.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.348
- No, I said I would
take care of it.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.600
- Yeah, but you didn't.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.186
- Make a reservation, no,
but I am gonna take care of it.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.730
- What are you talking about?

05:13.730 --> 05:15.898
This place is
impossible to get into.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.776
- Uh, yeah, but I'm not
playing that game anymore.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.069
- What game?

05:20.069 --> 05:22.405
- The reservation game.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.491
See, to make a reservation, you
have to be living in the future.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.910
And I'm actually trying to do
this thing where I live in the
now.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.747
- Okay, but...

05:30.747 --> 05:32.999
The reservation
would be for now.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.293
- Yeah, if you had made it
in the past, yeah.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.712
- I'm confused.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.714
- Okay, um, all right.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.507
Remember how everyone used to
call me
Stan-the-man-with-a-plan?

05:41.507 --> 05:43.051
- No.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.053
- I-I used to do everything
according to plan.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.221
Yet, shockingly,
my life didn't go as planned.

05:47.221 --> 05:49.265
So I'm embracing a new me.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.851
Stan-the-man-with-no-fucking-pla

05:54.062 --> 05:55.813
Just wait here.
I'm gonna go talk to them.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.066
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay? Trust me!

06:01.110 --> 06:02.862
- Good evening.
- Hey, how are you?

06:02.862 --> 06:05.573
Uh, party of two, please.
- Name?

06:05.573 --> 06:07.867
- Uh, no, I don't
have a reservation.

06:07.867 --> 06:11.079
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir,
we only take reservations.

06:11.079 --> 06:14.415
- Yeah, I-I figured that, but
I'm sure we can work something
out.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.709
We're happy to wait at the bar
or anything, really.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.045
- We're fully
booked this evening.

06:19.045 --> 06:22.090
- Right, which is why
I could use your help.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.550
- I'm sorry, there's really
nothing I can do to help you
tonight.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.260
- He's right, sir.
We're extremely busy.

06:26.260 --> 06:28.471
- Uh, no, I get that.
I do, um,

06:28.471 --> 06:31.516
but have you ever
heard of Eckhart Tolle?

06:31.516 --> 06:34.310
- No, and he's not getting a
table unless he has a
reservation.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.521
- Oh, no.
I'm not--I'm not name-dropping.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.940
I'm, uh--trying to appeal
to your better self.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.775
- Oh.

06:40.775 --> 06:44.112
- You see, I'm doing this thing
where I'm living in the now.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.615
Um, you know, being more
spontaneous. Going with the
flow.

06:47.615 --> 06:50.284
Letting the universe take you
where it wants to.

06:50.284 --> 06:52.245
- Well, that's interesting.
- It is!

06:52.245 --> 06:54.997
It is, but living in
the now pretty much

06:54.997 --> 06:56.874
precludes making
any sort of plans,

06:56.874 --> 06:59.627
which is why I didn't make a
reservation, if you follow.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.672
- Sure.
- Yes, okay, so,

07:02.672 --> 07:05.842
as you can imagine, if this
whole living in the now stuff is
gonna pan out,

07:05.842 --> 07:09.095
I need help from
like-minded people,

07:09.095 --> 07:10.263
and you seem like you might
be one of those people.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.764
- I am.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.182
- I-I'm going. I'm--

07:17.395 --> 07:19.147
Yeah, no,
I think you were right.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.232
- Hm.
Go figure.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.484
- Yeah.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.654
Look, I-I'm sensing
that my new life philosophy

07:26.654 --> 07:28.239
is gonna have a few
hiccups like this,

07:28.239 --> 07:31.075
and I'm gonna be wrong a lot.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.453
Well, I don't think
I'm wrong about this.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.830
There is a spot a few blocks
down that doesn't even take
reservations,

07:35.830 --> 07:37.665
and is fucking delicious.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.126
Will you give me one more shot?

07:40.126 --> 07:41.878
Maybe?

07:46.591 --> 07:48.926
- I can't believe
I'm eating this crap.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.304
- See, you're living
in the now, now.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.430
-
- It feels good, right?

07:52.430 --> 07:55.183
- Mm.
- Look at this.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.894
It's like ahh.
Just take this in, you know?

07:57.894 --> 08:00.771
Like the beautiful moon...

08:03.065 --> 08:05.943
Behind the clouds,
the gentle breeze,

08:05.943 --> 08:09.280
these gourmet dogs,
this lemonade!

08:09.280 --> 08:11.532
Are you kidding me with this
shit? What do they put in here?

08:11.532 --> 08:14.243
- I have to admit
it's pretty damn good.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.329
- It's better than sitting
in a stuffy restaurant, right?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.664
Out in nature,
amongst the people--

08:18.664 --> 08:19.707
- Give me all your
fucking money.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.876
- What, oh.
Wait, are you serious?

08:21.876 --> 08:24.629
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.
- Okay, all right, just--

08:24.629 --> 08:26.964
- Here.
- Now you.

08:26.964 --> 08:29.467
- I-I don't have any cash.
- Bullshit, okay?

08:29.467 --> 08:30.843
The hot dog stand
doesn't take plastic.

08:30.843 --> 08:34.722
- I-I paid.
- You fucking let her pay?

08:34.722 --> 08:37.725
- I--look, just like, just take
my debit and credit cards,
please.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.352
Just go--
- Fuck that.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.812
You want me to get seen on the
fucking cameras by the police,
huh?

08:41.812 --> 08:44.023
You have fucking cash.
You think I'm stupid?

08:44.023 --> 08:46.025
- What? No.
I think--I think you're lost.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.443
- Fuck you!

08:47.443 --> 08:49.820
- Wait, no,
I-I was a lost soul, too, okay?

08:49.820 --> 08:51.989
A shitty past, no future.
I get it.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.324
I know what you're
going through.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.785
All--all we have
is right now, okay?

08:55.785 --> 08:57.828
- It's you, me, and April.
That's it.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.413
- Ed, let it go. - You
don't--you don't have to do
this.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.166
You can walk away.
Just walk away.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.335
That's okay to do, all right?
All you have to do is just
embrace--

09:04.335 --> 09:05.503
- Shut the fuck up!

09:05.503 --> 09:07.338
- Oh, shit.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.677
- Oh, fuck, April!

09:14.178 --> 09:16.055
- Oh, did it--oh,
that's a lot of blood!

09:16.055 --> 09:17.640
Help!
Help!

09:17.640 --> 09:18.849
Someone call 911!
