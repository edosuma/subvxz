00:26.426 --> 00:27.552
Stacy's in a coma.

00:27.627 --> 00:29.788
There's a good chance
she may not come out of it.

00:29.863 --> 00:33.264
You wouldn't listen to me! You
just cost me my number one suspect.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.426
Are you saying being a cheerleader
had something to do with this?

00:35.468 --> 00:38.403
Two, three, four, five, six...

00:38.538 --> 00:41.302
You want a race, you got one.
Your car for my car.

00:42.575 --> 00:43.735
Michael,
how could you have done this?

00:43.777 --> 00:47.008
Bonnie, it was the only way.
Losing him in a race?

00:48.681 --> 00:50.410
Michael,
his fuel tank's ruptured.

00:50.483 --> 00:51.882
I gotta to get him out,
KITT.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.350
That nitro could blow
any second.

01:06.266 --> 01:07.699
Knight Rider...

01:07.767 --> 01:10.861
a shadowy flight into the
dangerous world of a man...

01:10.937 --> 01:13.132
who does not exist.

01:21.047 --> 01:23.242
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:23.316 --> 01:25.841
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:25.919 --> 01:27.978
the helpless, the powerless...

01:28.054 --> 01:31.353
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:02.081 --> 03:04.174
Oh, this is the Dagger DX?

03:05.385 --> 03:08.286
I was beginning to think it
only existed in your dreams.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.845
You'll find out it's for real
soon enough.

03:11.224 --> 03:12.521
My sweet.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.817
If you still have any doubts,
maybe we should up the stakes.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.863
No, $50,000 is enough.
I hate to see a grown man cry.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.641
3.8 miles. You think you can occupy
yourself for a minute and a half?

03:30.710 --> 03:33.008
Only if you promise
to come back in one piece.

03:33.079 --> 03:34.774
I'm a man
with a thousand lives.

03:34.847 --> 03:36.712
Just so you save
one of them for me.

03:36.783 --> 03:39.411
I'll do better than that.
I'll save them all.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.482
Something went wrong
with my brake system.

05:23.556 --> 05:26.889
Why'd you let her stand in the
street? I didn't let her do anything.

05:26.959 --> 05:30.292
Is she alive? Oh, my God.
What if she dies?

05:30.363 --> 05:34.129
I feel a pulse, but it's weak. Well,
somebody's gotta call an ambulance!

05:35.368 --> 05:36.699
Jack, I'll take care of it.

05:36.769 --> 05:39.237
Go home, get drunk, I don't
care, just get out of here.

05:39.305 --> 05:42.900
Keep your mouth shut. This didn't
happen. Tonight didn't happen.

05:47.980 --> 05:51.939
Call an ambulance. Just make sure
you're not here when it comes.

06:32.158 --> 06:33.887
According to Coach Berchuk...

06:33.960 --> 06:37.418
his Cougars should have no problem
with the Mustangs on Sunday.

06:37.730 --> 06:41.222
That's exactly why I'm
picking the Mustangs to win.

06:41.300 --> 06:44.758
Every time Berchuk toots
his horn, his team loses.

06:44.937 --> 06:47.303
Twenty-two men
in mock war regalia...

06:47.373 --> 06:48.704
knocking each other down...

06:48.775 --> 06:51.608
for possession of an air-filled
bladder made of a pig's skin.

06:53.946 --> 06:58.280
Well, some human institutions confuse
me, but football is a total mystery.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.249
I wish I could
help you out, KITT.

07:00.319 --> 07:02.048
But it's a little like
buttermilk.

07:02.121 --> 07:03.884
Either you like it
or you don't.

07:03.956 --> 07:06.686
Michael, if you're going to use
a multi-million dollar system...

07:06.759 --> 07:10.695
to read a 25 cent paper, you
could at least read the front page.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.262
Be well informed.

07:12.331 --> 07:16.165
Okay, wise guy. Lay a little
world, national, and local on me.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.759
That's more like it.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.032
Allow me.

07:20.139 --> 07:24.803
"In Washington today, hearings
resume on nuclear power.

07:24.877 --> 07:27.573
"While in New York..."
Wait a minute, KITT.

07:28.481 --> 07:30.540
Blow up the left-hand corner.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.919
Stacy?
Someone you know, Michael?

07:36.823 --> 07:39.257
Someone I knew
a long time ago.

07:53.372 --> 07:56.535
She's a fighter, Mr.
Courtney. She won't let go.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.542
Thanks, Diane.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.223
I've gotta go back
to the stadium now.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.674
Sgt. Courtney?
Lieutenant.

08:32.979 --> 08:35.243
How is she?
Fine.

08:36.448 --> 08:37.938
I'm a friend.

08:38.284 --> 08:41.481
I don't remember your face.
What's your name?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.380
Knight. Michael Knight.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.591
Do you know anything about
what happened last night?

08:47.660 --> 08:50.925
No, sir. I wish I did.
I know I would like to help.

08:51.664 --> 08:53.495
I don't need any help.

09:06.846 --> 09:09.076
Michael, I expected you
over an hour ago.

09:09.148 --> 09:11.378
Whatever it is
will have to wait.

09:11.651 --> 09:14.848
I beg your pardon. Sorry,
Devon, I'm a little uptight.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.321
You remember Jim Courtney?
Courtney?

09:17.790 --> 09:20.020
Your partner when you were
on the police force?

09:20.092 --> 09:22.060
Yeah, well,
when you're a rookie...

09:22.428 --> 09:24.953
you don't have a partner,
Devon, you have a second father.

09:25.031 --> 09:26.999
That's what Jim was to me.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.258
What happened?

09:28.334 --> 09:31.497
His daughter Stacy
was in an accident last night.

09:31.971 --> 09:33.199
Hit and run.

09:33.539 --> 09:37.134
I'm sorry about that, Michael, but I
fail to see how that postpones our work.

09:37.209 --> 09:39.643
Well, whoever did it left
her lying alone in the street.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.703
I'm gonna make sure
I find out who it was...

09:41.781 --> 09:44.079
and make sure he gets
what he deserves.

09:44.150 --> 09:47.244
God knows Stacy didn't.
All right, Michael.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.852
Okay, stay in touch.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.856
Thanks, Devon, I will.

09:52.325 --> 09:56.386
All right, KITT. Access the
police reports on Stacy's accident.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.456
Dig deep, pal. Dig real deep.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.227
Right away, Michael.

10:01.367 --> 10:04.063
Two, three, four, five, six...

10:04.136 --> 10:08.095
seven, eight, and turn.
Two, three, four, five, six.

10:08.174 --> 10:12.076
Here we go! One, two,
three, four, five, six...

10:20.753 --> 10:24.484
Way to go out there, kid. You
look all pro. Take a shower.

10:24.557 --> 10:27.958
Okay if I take one of them with
me? Take two, they're small.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.459
Four!

10:40.139 --> 10:42.004
Diane, how is she?
Any change?

10:42.074 --> 10:44.474
No. She's still critical.

10:44.543 --> 10:47.671
What happened? What was she doing
down there in the first place?

10:47.747 --> 10:49.146
I don't know what you mean.

10:49.215 --> 10:52.912
She was with you last night celebrating
her ballet scholarship, right?

10:52.985 --> 10:56.113
Yeah, until about 10:00 or
10:15. Didn't she tell you?

10:56.355 --> 10:58.983
Tell me what? I got an
emergency call from Dallas.

10:59.058 --> 11:00.355
We hadn't even ordered dinner.

11:00.426 --> 11:03.122
I told her I'd send her home in
a car and she said she'd call you.

11:03.195 --> 11:05.959
Diane, come on. You're her roommate,
you've gotta know something.

11:06.032 --> 11:07.499
She didn't call me.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.733
I didn't even know you'd
gone to Dallas until now.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.906
The thought of losing her.
I am going crazy.

11:22.081 --> 11:25.642
I want to go to the hospital,
but if the reporters find out...

11:26.352 --> 11:28.149
I feel like such a coward.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.586
There's nothing you can do,
Mr. Taylor.

11:31.657 --> 11:33.852
Think of Stacy's father, too.

11:34.660 --> 11:36.890
If he ever found out
she was dating a married man...

11:36.962 --> 11:38.793
Yeah,
I guess you're right.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.898
There's been
enough confusion and pain.

11:42.268 --> 11:45.669
This will be our little secret.
Yours, mine, and Stacy's, okay?

11:46.672 --> 11:47.661
Okay.

12:10.162 --> 12:13.325
This is the place, Michael.
I got you, buddy.

12:19.472 --> 12:23.408
All right. I want pictures
of these skid marks.

12:25.511 --> 12:27.308
Looks like
they're really wide.

12:29.648 --> 12:31.445
Four sets, two cars.

12:33.719 --> 12:36.483
And made of very expensive,
cold-rolled rubber.

12:36.555 --> 12:40.082
Used in Formula One racing and
discarded after each performance.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.252
Yeah, well, this is no
race track, is it, pal?

12:42.328 --> 12:44.353
Obviously not.
Could it be we're dealing...

12:44.430 --> 12:46.898
with some high-class type
of drag racers?

12:46.966 --> 12:51.232
Called banzai-running, KITT. A speed
kick for the man who has everything.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.004
Wait a minute.

12:56.709 --> 12:57.676
Here's something.

13:11.657 --> 13:14.956
All right, give me an analysis
of this paint chip, will you?

13:19.698 --> 13:23.134
It's exotic and highly unusual,
Michael. It might take a while.

13:25.104 --> 13:29.302
These guys use racing tires. The
chances are they use racing fuel.

13:29.441 --> 13:31.602
Get me a list of the places
handling nitromethane.

13:31.677 --> 13:32.905
Right away.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.170
There's only one outlet
in this area, Michael.

13:35.247 --> 13:37.442
One will do just fine, pal.

14:00.472 --> 14:01.734
Private club, huh?

14:01.807 --> 14:05.072
Judging by their signs, I'd
say it's not a very social one.

14:05.144 --> 14:06.975
That's all right, pal.

14:07.213 --> 14:08.976
This isn't a social call.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.579
Is that any way to treat
a brother racer?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.974
Since you speak English, I
assume that you can read it, too.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.416
This is for members only
and you're trespassing.

15:20.486 --> 15:23.216
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just
hoping to meet some of the boys.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.450
Get in on
some of the banzai action.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.525
You got the wrong club,
stretch.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.356
Banzai racing's illegal.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.056
Hey, come on,
you're talking to me now.

15:32.131 --> 15:34.929
Like the Boss says, cars
like this were "Born to Run".

15:35.000 --> 15:36.024
Hands off!

15:37.803 --> 15:39.065
What's the "E" stand for?

15:39.138 --> 15:41.163
It stands for either you
walk out of here right now...

15:41.240 --> 15:44.004
or I call security
and they bounce you out.

15:44.643 --> 15:46.702
Take a little picture of this
and trace it, will you?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.542
Right away, Michael.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.944
Well, it's been
a real pleasure meeting you...

15:56.021 --> 15:57.784
and we've got to do it again
sometime.

16:06.265 --> 16:08.961
Michael, I've got the trace
on that club logo.

16:10.736 --> 16:14.172
Lay it on me, pal. They call
themselves the Racer's Edge.

16:14.239 --> 16:15.900
Sounds right
for a bunch of yahoos...

16:15.975 --> 16:17.602
who like to push it
to the limit, huh?

16:17.676 --> 16:21.942
You might be interested in knowing
their president also owns the LA Cougars.

16:22.014 --> 16:23.174
Mark Taylor?

16:23.248 --> 16:26.081
You really know your football,
don't you, Michael?

16:28.187 --> 16:30.781
Right, left, right.

16:31.357 --> 16:34.053
But Mark, somebody may
already be on to us.

16:34.126 --> 16:35.821
I just got a call
from the club.

16:35.894 --> 16:38.920
Ladonna said some guy
in a black T-top, a Michael...

16:38.998 --> 16:42.900
Knight. I got the same call.
Difference is, I'm not panicking.

16:42.968 --> 16:44.435
Mark,
Stacy's on the critical list.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.403
If she dies,
we're accessories to murder.

16:46.472 --> 16:47.803
We gotta do something
about this.

16:47.873 --> 16:49.932
We gotta deal with this thing
before it's too late.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.375
Calm down.
Just take a look around.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.711
Everything you see I own.
And a whole lot more.

16:55.781 --> 16:59.512
Now, you think I got all this by
not taking care of little details?

17:00.386 --> 17:03.150
Believe me, it cost,
but our alibi is covered.

17:03.222 --> 17:06.281
Tell that to Stacy's father.
Why didn't you say he was a cop?

17:06.358 --> 17:09.555
Jack, I have to buy
other people...

17:10.596 --> 17:13.622
but I count on friends
like you. Listen to me.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.694
You're overreacting.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.862
You're ready to be crucified on
a billboard on Sunset Boulevard.

17:18.936 --> 17:22.202
Now all confessing is going to do is
drastically lower both our lifestyles.

17:22.273 --> 17:24.174
It is not going to help Stacy.

17:26.845 --> 17:28.710
No, I guess you're right.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.181
Remember that the next time
you start to panic.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.343
Everything's gonna
work out fine.

17:39.158 --> 17:41.490
He's gonna crack,
sooner or later.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.954
I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this.

17:59.011 --> 18:01.172
Michael, did you know
that on third down...

18:01.246 --> 18:04.704
72.3% of the time
the defensive team will blitz?

18:04.783 --> 18:07.980
Well, I'm glad to see you're starting
to appreciate the game, buddy.

18:08.053 --> 18:11.716
Yes. I place its complexity
somewhere above checkers...

18:11.790 --> 18:13.417
and below World War II.

18:20.165 --> 18:22.030
...three, four. Stretch out.

18:22.101 --> 18:25.036
One, two, three, four.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.699
And over.
One, two, three, four.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.901
Side. Right. Left.

18:30.976 --> 18:32.034
And twist it.

18:32.111 --> 18:36.104
Right, right, and left.
Left and right.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.106
Right, left, and right
and right.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.981
Left and left.
Right and right.

18:41.053 --> 18:44.784
Left and left and rock,
two, three, four.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.325
Okay, guys, that's it.
Great, team.

18:51.663 --> 18:54.097
Excuse me.
Are you Diane Landra?

18:54.399 --> 18:56.629
Yes.
Hi, my name is Michael Knight.

18:56.702 --> 18:58.397
I'm a friend of Stacy's.

18:59.605 --> 19:02.972
Oh, no, don't tell me she's...
No, no, she's holding her own.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.100
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to frighten you.

19:05.177 --> 19:07.543
It's just so horrible,
what happened last night.

19:07.613 --> 19:09.638
Well, do you know
what happened?

19:09.715 --> 19:10.875
Where she was going?

19:10.949 --> 19:13.213
No. She never told me.

19:14.286 --> 19:15.685
Nice meeting you.

19:22.094 --> 19:26.690
Diane. Look, I'm just trying
to find out who ran down Stacy.

19:26.965 --> 19:28.865
You want that too,
don't you?

19:30.936 --> 19:35.635
Well, I'm sorry. It's just I
feel so much of this is my fault.

19:36.642 --> 19:39.304
You see, she became a
cheerleader because of me.

19:39.444 --> 19:42.936
Are you saying being a cheerleader
had something to do with this?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.846
Everything all right, Diane?

19:44.917 --> 19:48.717
Sure. This is Michael Knight.
He's a friend of Stacy's.

19:48.987 --> 19:52.320
I hope to heaven she's gonna be
all right. Yeah, yeah, me too.

19:52.791 --> 19:55.624
You finished for the day?
Yes, I am, Mr. Taylor.

19:55.727 --> 19:58.423
I thought I'd stop by
the hospital. Good girl.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.657
Thanks.

20:03.168 --> 20:06.035
Nice lines. Is it fast?

20:06.805 --> 20:10.366
Yeah. I'd say it's about the
fastest thing on four wheels.

20:10.742 --> 20:12.972
Oh, now, that's quite a boast,
Mr. Knight.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.512
Well, why don't you try me?

20:14.580 --> 20:17.708
I mean, you are the number one
guy at Racer's Edge, aren't you?

20:17.783 --> 20:19.114
That's true.

20:19.251 --> 20:21.879
I'm also pretty busy. I've
got my boys to think about.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.546
We're gonna win
the Super Bowl this year.

20:23.622 --> 20:24.714
Yeah!

20:27.426 --> 20:28.893
I'll tell you what.

20:31.697 --> 20:34.393
Our number two man
can give you quite a race.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.432
Well,
I gotta start somewhere.

20:38.103 --> 20:40.469
Why not? Of course,
Jack won't run for fun.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.530
$50,000 is his normal wager.

20:42.608 --> 20:45.236
Still interested?
No, no, I'm excited.

20:46.144 --> 20:48.374
Time and place.
5:00 p.m.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.748
Club track at Saugus.
I'll be there.

20:50.816 --> 20:54.115
Beat him and maybe
I'll give you a run myself.

20:54.486 --> 20:55.783
I'll hold you to it.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.936
Are you crazy?
Jack's in no shape to race.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.375
I know that.
I'll handle Jack.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.435
You just take care
of his car.

21:27.653 --> 21:31.419
You plan to race me against
one of those banzai baboons?

21:32.391 --> 21:35.724
What better way to get us in tight with
the men who caused Stacy's accident?

21:35.794 --> 21:39.230
And if we play our cards right, we
might even draw out the car that hit her.

21:40.065 --> 21:41.965
Michael, I hope you know
what you're doing.

21:42.034 --> 21:45.435
Well, KITT, every quarterback's
gotta scramble once in a while.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.237
At least
we're off and running.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.603
Yes, but are we speeding?

21:50.008 --> 21:51.100
No, why?

21:53.745 --> 21:55.110
Pull over!

22:10.395 --> 22:13.125
I didn't know police lieutenants
worked traffic detail.

22:13.198 --> 22:15.689
There's obviously a lot about
the police you don't know.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.998
Primarily, we don't like amateurs
mucking up our investigation...

22:19.071 --> 22:21.539
by wearing out the leads.
Get the picture?

22:21.606 --> 22:23.801
Yes, sir. I got it.
Good.

22:24.209 --> 22:26.939
Because if I ever hear of you
asking questions again...

22:27.012 --> 22:29.640
I'm going to consider slapping
you with an obstruction charge.

22:29.715 --> 22:33.242
Just remember one thing.
We're on the same side here.

22:33.919 --> 22:37.082
Yeah. What side is that?

22:38.824 --> 22:42.089
If anyone smelled a little hinky,
it's you, Mr. Michael Knight.

22:42.928 --> 22:47.331
I checked you out. Up to two
years ago, you didn't exist.

22:49.334 --> 22:52.792
Now do me a favor.
Disappear again.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.200
How's Stacy?
The same.

23:00.779 --> 23:03.270
Any objections to someone
saying a prayer for her?

23:03.348 --> 23:05.714
Sure, she needs all
she can get.

23:23.635 --> 23:27.571
Buddy, I'm starting to worry
about Jim. He's wound pretty tight.

23:27.639 --> 23:31.234
So I see. But you might consider
worrying a bit about Devon.

23:31.610 --> 23:34.170
You haven't asked him
for the race money yet.

23:35.380 --> 23:38.907
You got any strategy, pal? How
about the quarterback sneak?

23:39.751 --> 23:42.652
All right. Get me Devon.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.390
Hello, Devon.
Hello, Michael.

23:46.458 --> 23:48.688
Are you sitting down?
How much do you want?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.694
$50,000.

23:53.231 --> 23:54.823
Now I'm sitting down.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.536
Michael, sometimes you really
know how to hurt a guy.

24:08.613 --> 24:11.207
That car isn't fit
to shine my bumpers.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.717
Let's keep the race
fairly close, pal.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.379
We just want to move up
in the organization.

24:30.101 --> 24:32.831
Is that the price of
admission? Yeah, that's it.

24:32.904 --> 24:36.135
You can count it if you want. But don't
worry, it's coming right back to me.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.073
Five laps, Mr. Knight.

24:39.544 --> 24:40.806
Let it rock.

24:44.549 --> 24:48.542
Michael, the tires on that car match
up with the prints at the accident site.

24:48.620 --> 24:51.088
But this car's red, not gold,
like the paint chip.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.556
Oh, we're getting warmer,
huh?

25:53.518 --> 25:55.577
Michael, he's losing it, and his wiring
is shorting out.

25:55.654 --> 25:58.384
I gotta get him out, KITT. That
nitro could blow any second.

26:08.133 --> 26:09.498
Jack!

26:13.371 --> 26:14.770
I wonder why we do it.

26:14.839 --> 26:16.204
So do I, Mr. Taylor.

26:17.676 --> 26:18.802
So do I.

26:30.055 --> 26:32.421
Dr. Hoffman. 64, please.

26:46.705 --> 26:48.332
Any improvement?

26:49.174 --> 26:50.300
A little.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.570
Well, even a little
is encouraging.

26:52.644 --> 26:54.509
You wouldn't listen to me,
would you!

26:54.579 --> 26:56.376
You couldn't keep your nose
out of it.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.075
If you're talking about
Lehigh...

26:58.149 --> 26:59.673
You bet that's who
I'm talking about!

26:59.751 --> 27:03.448
His car was there that night! I
was this far from picking him up.

27:04.522 --> 27:08.117
You just cost me my number one
suspect. Lehigh didn't run down Stacy.

27:08.193 --> 27:09.524
You don't know that for sure!

27:09.594 --> 27:12.154
The car he was racing was red.
The one that hit Stacy was gold.

27:12.230 --> 27:13.492
Now that much I do know.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.795
All right, so even if
he didn't do it himself...

27:15.867 --> 27:17.801
I could've got him
to tell me who did.

27:17.869 --> 27:19.928
No way.
You were two steps behind.

27:20.005 --> 27:22.667
Lehigh was a dead man the
minute he drove on that track.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.231
It was no accident.

27:24.743 --> 27:27.211
Maybe it's time
we started working together.

27:27.278 --> 27:28.540
Working together!

27:28.613 --> 27:31.013
Yeah, Jimbo, working together.
Hey, wait a minute.

27:31.082 --> 27:35.178
Jimbo, it's a name out of the
past. What made you call me that?

27:35.787 --> 27:37.982
I don't know.
It just seemed natural.

27:38.056 --> 27:40.251
Natural, huh?
You're sure that's all it is?

27:41.226 --> 27:42.853
Yeah, I'm sure!

27:43.995 --> 27:47.453
It's only natural for me
to work alone, so forget it.

28:02.147 --> 28:05.116
Thinking about Stacy?
Yeah.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.315
I really miss her.
That makes two of us.

28:10.555 --> 28:13.319
Diane, has this Michael Knight
been around again?

28:15.093 --> 28:16.993
No, why?

28:17.562 --> 28:19.587
Oh, just curious.

28:20.131 --> 28:22.361
He's been asking my friends
a lot of questions lately...

28:22.434 --> 28:24.265
and poking his nose
into my business.

28:24.335 --> 28:26.064
I won't tolerate that.

28:26.137 --> 28:28.628
And there's something else
I won't tolerate.

28:29.107 --> 28:30.438
Disloyalty.

28:31.142 --> 28:33.269
I expect my friends,
my players...

28:33.344 --> 28:37.713
all the people who work for me to
give 110% loyalty all the time.

28:38.149 --> 28:39.639
You understand that?

28:40.118 --> 28:41.346
Yes.

28:42.187 --> 28:43.552
That's my girl.

28:44.322 --> 28:46.187
And so if this Knight
come around again...

28:46.257 --> 28:48.521
you're gonna send him away and
you're gonna call me, right?

28:48.593 --> 28:50.254
If that's what you want.

29:03.842 --> 29:05.969
I'm glad we had
a chance to talk.

29:07.445 --> 29:09.436
You have a good evening.
Yeah.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.242
Thanks for the lift.
You bet.

29:14.986 --> 29:16.112
Bye.

29:28.867 --> 29:31.233
Taylor drive
all his Kittens home?

29:32.437 --> 29:35.736
If it's any of your business, my car's
in the shop. He offered me a lift.

29:35.807 --> 29:39.334
No kidding. That's what I call
supporting your local cheerleader.

29:39.410 --> 29:40.638
Look, what do you want?

29:40.712 --> 29:43.203
I want to know who Stacy
had a date with last night.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.181
I'm her roommate,
not her shadow.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.013
She's also your best friend.

29:47.085 --> 29:48.177
I don't know.

29:48.253 --> 29:52.349
Diane, Stacy's in a coma. There's a
good chance she may not come out of it.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.723
Don't you think I know that?

29:57.796 --> 29:59.491
If you care, then tell me.

29:59.564 --> 30:01.464
I can't.
Why not?

30:02.267 --> 30:03.598
All right.
Yesterday you said...

30:03.668 --> 30:06.262
it had something to do
with her being a cheerleader.

30:06.337 --> 30:08.328
Wait a minute...

30:08.740 --> 30:11.766
Mark Taylor. Stacy had a date
with Mark Taylor. Is that it?

30:11.843 --> 30:14.209
He told me he didn't have
anything to do with her accident.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.076
They'd had dinner
earlier that evening...

30:16.147 --> 30:19.139
and then he was called out
of town. And you believe that?

30:19.617 --> 30:21.016
You don't?
No, I don't.

30:21.085 --> 30:24.316
Not for a second. Diane, he
was there. You believe that.

30:24.389 --> 30:26.516
All right, thanks a lot.
You helped.

30:31.095 --> 30:33.962
Michael, the airport logs
confirm Taylor's alibi.

30:34.032 --> 30:36.865
So his private jet took off
and landed, huh?

30:36.935 --> 30:39.062
That doesn't mean
he was on it.

30:39.704 --> 30:41.228
By the way...

30:41.840 --> 30:45.037
anything on the analysis on that
paint chip from the accident site?

30:45.510 --> 30:48.843
It's a special high-lead racing
paint from a factory in Italy.

30:48.913 --> 30:51.347
They make a car
called the Dagger DX.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.643
All right, show me
what you've got on that car.

30:54.452 --> 30:58.821
A double turbo 600 horse engine.
Zero to 60 in 3.5 seconds.

30:58.890 --> 31:00.824
Top speed 200 plus.

31:00.892 --> 31:04.328
Totally illegal to drive in this
country by all civilized standards.

31:04.395 --> 31:07.489
Yeah, well, no one ever accused
these guys of being civilized.

31:08.099 --> 31:09.999
Any chance Taylor owns one?

31:10.101 --> 31:11.932
With his money,
anything is possible...

31:12.003 --> 31:14.801
although I can't find
a registration to prove it.

31:14.906 --> 31:18.137
Then maybe we'll just have to
find another way to prove it, pal.

31:28.686 --> 31:31.814
Scan the area.
See if you can find a way in.

31:33.291 --> 31:35.452
Michael,
there is one open gate.

31:35.526 --> 31:37.721
All right. Let's go for it.

31:57.849 --> 32:00.579
Why do I feel like I'm
entering the jaws of a cougar?

32:00.652 --> 32:02.313
It's football fever, pal.

32:02.387 --> 32:04.014
Oh, well,
I sure hope there's a cure.

32:18.369 --> 32:20.166
Woe! Nice catch, buddy.

32:20.238 --> 32:23.071
Why are those helmeted
behemoths after me, Michael?

32:23.141 --> 32:24.870
Because you got the ball,
buddy.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.475
I really don't enjoy
this game.

32:30.915 --> 32:32.883
Hey, pal,
what are you doing?

32:32.951 --> 32:35.749
It's not a game, pal,
it's showtime.

32:36.587 --> 32:39.283
I want the spotlight
to be on us.

32:41.693 --> 32:42.682
Him again.

32:43.761 --> 32:45.456
I'll give him credit
for one thing...

32:45.530 --> 32:46.690
he knows
how to make an entrance.

32:46.764 --> 32:49.130
Hey, you know, you're
a regular Marcus Allen.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.567
Frankly, Michael, I prefer
being a Knight Industries 2000.

33:03.314 --> 33:06.772
Fantastic! I've never seen
moves like that before.

33:06.851 --> 33:09.513
Hey, well, you should
see me on my pass plays.

33:09.854 --> 33:12.550
I'm pretty aggressive
on offense myself.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.252
Somehow, this doesn't sound
like football talk to me.

33:16.327 --> 33:17.316
Who said that?

33:17.395 --> 33:19.625
Don't listen to him. He
knows nothing about football.

33:19.697 --> 33:22.530
Very impressive, Knight. But you're
interrupting my practice again.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.794
Hey.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.701
You promised me a race,
remember?

33:26.904 --> 33:28.633
You don't want your boys
here to think...

33:28.706 --> 33:31.334
you don't have the guts to go
one-on-one, do you?

33:31.442 --> 33:32.966
You're pushing it.
Oh, really?

33:33.044 --> 33:36.844
Well, if you want to back down in front
of all these people, no hard feelings.

33:36.914 --> 33:39.974
Have a real safe day,
Mr. Taylor.

33:40.084 --> 33:41.073
You!

33:44.922 --> 33:48.551
You want a race, you got one. But not
for money. I'm talking pink slips now.

33:48.626 --> 33:50.526
Your car for mine.

33:52.196 --> 33:53.720
You got the guts for that?

33:53.798 --> 33:57.131
I'll meet you at the track.
No track. Streets.

33:57.702 --> 33:58.930
Midnight.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.831
Banzai. You're on.

34:29.934 --> 34:33.802
Michael, I knew a man like Taylor wouldn't
bring out the guilty car for a race.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.395
I didn't think
he would either, pal.

34:35.473 --> 34:37.940
Then what are we going to do now? Now...

34:39.976 --> 34:41.672
it's on to Plan B.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.043
Plan B, what is Plan B?

34:44.949 --> 34:47.143
Not now, buddy,
we got a race to run.

35:28.559 --> 35:31.494
Michael, you lost me.
What happened to Plan B?

35:31.562 --> 35:33.587
This is Plan B.

35:33.664 --> 35:36.258
I'm going to shut all your
systems down now, partner.

35:36.334 --> 35:39.167
Oh, no, Michael! You're not
handing me over to that...

35:45.209 --> 35:47.234
It's the only way, pal.

35:49.714 --> 35:51.238
It's the only way.

36:03.427 --> 36:04.792
Take good care of it, huh?

36:04.862 --> 36:07.660
Just be glad your car
is the only thing you lost.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.066
Push me again
and you're history.

36:13.204 --> 36:14.899
Hang in there, buddy.

36:31.822 --> 36:33.881
Michael,
how could you have done this?

36:33.958 --> 36:37.052
Bonnie, it was the only way.
Losing him in a race?

36:37.128 --> 36:38.925
Really, Michael,
you overstepped your bounds.

36:38.996 --> 36:41.260
For the last time,
I didn't lose him.

36:41.365 --> 36:44.095
To keep Taylor from discovering
all of KITT's capabilities...

36:44.168 --> 36:47.103
I turned off all of his functions
except the homing signal.

36:47.171 --> 36:50.732
I figured that would lead us to
where Taylor is keeping the Dagger DX.

36:50.808 --> 36:53.038
Fine, fine! Except that I've
got so much interference...

36:53.110 --> 36:55.374
I can't tell what's coming
from KITT and what isn't.

36:55.446 --> 36:57.744
Why now, all right,
all right, let's keep calm.

36:58.149 --> 37:00.845
Bonnie, where is the
primary signal coming from?

37:01.385 --> 37:04.013
Considering the reflections,
I can't even hazard a guess.

37:04.088 --> 37:05.817
Maybe the interference
is coming...

37:05.890 --> 37:08.051
from some power lines or
something we could get past.

37:08.125 --> 37:10.252
Now, can you at least
get me a starting point?

37:10.328 --> 37:11.955
South.
South, okay, let's go.

37:12.029 --> 37:14.497
You bring this. Devon,
I need your keys.

37:14.732 --> 37:17.360
I hope it works, Michael.
We'll make it work.

37:30.214 --> 37:33.377
Diane, what is this nonsense
about you quitting the team?

37:34.151 --> 37:36.619
I want to go back home.
Back to my folks.

37:36.854 --> 37:39.414
When I hired you, you said
it was a chance of a lifetime.

37:39.490 --> 37:42.721
National exposure and all
that. Why the change of heart?

37:43.327 --> 37:45.488
It's Michael Knight, isn't it?
No.

37:46.497 --> 37:48.522
What did he tell you?
Nothing.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.294
Then he did talk to you.

37:50.835 --> 37:53.065
Diane, come on. Friends
don't lie to each other.

37:53.137 --> 37:56.903
You lied to me, Mr. Taylor. And
I can't work for you anymore.

37:57.742 --> 38:00.540
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.

38:03.514 --> 38:04.879
Talk to me.

38:04.949 --> 38:08.407
The signal's stronger now,
but it's in multiples.

38:08.486 --> 38:11.216
Bonnie, spare me
the technical analysis.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.757
I need a direction.
Right or left?

38:14.358 --> 38:15.518
Left.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.719
Forget pulling the engine
on the car, boss.

38:47.792 --> 38:49.657
I can't even get
under the hood.

38:49.727 --> 38:51.854
What's she doing here?
She knows.

38:56.033 --> 38:57.432
Tie her up.

39:01.238 --> 39:05.106
Michael, the signal's almost at
full strength. We're getting closer.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.811
What's around here?

39:09.980 --> 39:13.416
Taylor's stadium and
headquarters. That's gotta be it.

39:22.893 --> 39:26.659
Jim Courtney. Yeah, patch me
through. It's an emergency.

39:32.136 --> 39:33.433
This is Courtney.

39:33.504 --> 39:36.837
Jim, it's Michael Knight. Look,
I don't have time to explain...

39:36.907 --> 39:39.808
but if you want the man
who ran down Stacy...

39:39.877 --> 39:42.778
meet me behind the Taylor
building. I'm on my way.

39:53.591 --> 39:55.058
Let's get ready to move.

39:55.126 --> 39:56.457
What's the plan?

39:56.894 --> 40:00.557
I think it'd be a lot better for both
of us, friend, if you didn't know.

40:10.541 --> 40:12.736
Okay, bright eyes.
What have you got?

40:13.677 --> 40:16.544
Jim. It was Mark Taylor.

40:17.515 --> 40:19.676
The car he drove was somewhere
in that complex.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.048
No one knows this place
better than you.

40:22.119 --> 40:23.177
Let's go.

40:56.220 --> 40:59.155
What's behind here?
Maintenance stairway.

40:59.423 --> 41:01.516
It can get us anyplace.

41:01.592 --> 41:05.119
How did you know I could find my
way around here with my eyes closed?

41:06.130 --> 41:09.099
Only two people knew that
this was on my rookie beat.

41:09.533 --> 41:13.128
My watch commander and my
old partner, Michael Long.

41:15.372 --> 41:18.136
You want to talk now
or you want to find that car?

41:37.428 --> 41:39.020
KITT, can you read me?

41:41.065 --> 41:42.896
Rise and shine,
Sleeping Beauty...

41:42.967 --> 41:44.662
I've just reactivated
your systems.

41:47.004 --> 41:49.996
I'm so glad you're here.
They've got Diane. Hurry!

41:50.074 --> 41:51.268
Where are you, buddy?

41:51.342 --> 41:53.537
It's some sort of
private garage, Michael.

41:53.611 --> 41:55.841
- That help any?
- You know it.

41:56.680 --> 41:57.942
Who was that?

41:58.115 --> 42:01.642
- Another partner? - No. No, that's
just a friend on the inside.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.695
I'll take it from here.
Open the door.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.266
There's the door.

42:22.339 --> 42:25.137
- All right, you take high and
I'll take low. - You got it, Mike.

42:33.450 --> 42:35.748
Glad to have you back
in the driver's seat, Michael.

42:35.819 --> 42:37.252
That makes two of us, pal.

42:37.321 --> 42:38.686
Let's go get him.

43:24.435 --> 43:27.268
All right, KITT, give me
a readout of what's ahead.

43:27.338 --> 43:30.364
Michael, two miles
of extremely hazardous curves.

43:30.441 --> 43:33.069
That doesn't seem to be
slowing him down, does it?

43:49.326 --> 43:52.591
Michael, these curves are
too critical for that car.

43:53.097 --> 43:55.190
KITT, we gotta stop him.

44:03.273 --> 44:05.400
KITT, warm up your
microwave jam?

44:05.476 --> 44:08.912
Michael, for that to work we have
to be within 50 yards of our target.

44:08.979 --> 44:11.004
Michael,
the target is in range.

44:11.081 --> 44:14.278
There's no way Taylor would be able to
control the skidding on these curves.

44:14.351 --> 44:15.682
He's losing it anyway,
buddy.

44:15.753 --> 44:17.448
But if you try it,
you could kill them.

44:17.521 --> 44:20.922
If I don't try, they're
gonna go right over the cliff.

44:23.861 --> 44:25.419
All right. It's a go, pal!

45:03.167 --> 45:04.896
Not today, pal.

45:05.169 --> 45:07.103
You're not worth it.

45:11.809 --> 45:12.969
You all right?

45:13.043 --> 45:14.169
Oh, I am now.

45:32.529 --> 45:34.759
Your father tells me you'll
be dancing again real soon.

45:34.832 --> 45:38.768
Yes. The Ballet Academy even agreed
to hold my scholarship for me.

45:38.836 --> 45:40.667
She's gonna be
a real superstar.

45:40.738 --> 45:41.762
Just wait and see.

45:41.839 --> 45:43.397
That's terrific.

45:44.641 --> 45:47.132
Oh, thanks for your help.

45:47.277 --> 45:48.403
My pleasure.

45:48.479 --> 45:50.879
By the way, I've got
a little present for you.

45:50.948 --> 45:53.542
- Oh, come on, there's no need
for that. - No, no, it's a...

45:53.884 --> 45:56.182
Used to belong
to a partner of mine.

45:56.487 --> 45:59.388
- You remind me of him a lot.
- No kidding.

46:00.324 --> 46:03.191
- What was his name?
- Michael Long.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.061
Special guy.

46:10.701 --> 46:12.293
By any standards.

46:13.470 --> 46:14.664
Thanks.

46:16.807 --> 46:18.934
I'll take real good care
of it.

46:19.243 --> 46:21.404
- See you around.
- Yeah.

46:21.645 --> 46:22.839
Bye, Stacy.

46:22.946 --> 46:24.072
Bye. Thanks.

46:29.486 --> 46:30.680
Michael.

46:34.158 --> 46:36.854
Michael, what's this I hear
about KITT playing football?

46:36.927 --> 46:41.125
I tell you, Devon, KITT is
the next OJ. Check this out.

46:45.402 --> 46:47.495
37, wing right, left.

46:49.540 --> 46:51.906
The bomb.
The bomb.

46:56.814 --> 47:00.910
All right, KITT. 36, 24...

47:01.151 --> 47:03.813
36. Hut! Hut!

47:05.189 --> 47:06.383
All right!

47:08.792 --> 47:10.885
Here it comes, buddy.

47:13.397 --> 47:14.625
It's all mine, Michael.

47:30.781 --> 47:32.874
Now for the extra point.

47:34.351 --> 47:35.579
Michael.

47:41.391 --> 47:43.518
Michael, you can't be serious.

47:43.994 --> 47:47.361
Michael, you wouldn't really... Michael!

47:47.965 --> 47:49.296
Banzai!

47:51.835 --> 47:53.700
- Michael!
- No!
