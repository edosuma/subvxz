WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:05.473
Boy's voice:
The wars were so long ago,

00:05.506 --> 00:07.241
nobody even remembers.

00:09.177 --> 00:13.547
Darkness and fear ruled
until the time of the barons,

00:13.581 --> 00:17.185
seven men and women
who forged order out of chaos.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.391
People flocked to them
for protection.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.128
That protection
became servitude.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.165
They banished guns
and trained armies

00:31.199 --> 00:34.302
of lethal fighters
they called Clippers.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.437
This world
is built on blood.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.839
Nobody is innocent here.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.175
Welcome to the Badlands.

00:41.209 --> 00:44.044
( flies buzzing )

01:50.244 --> 01:52.380
( bird screeches )

01:54.615 --> 01:56.917
( men chattering )

01:56.950 --> 01:58.786
( liquid sloshes )

01:58.819 --> 02:01.422
( motorcycle approaching )

02:01.455 --> 02:03.891
( chatter stops )

02:11.799 --> 02:12.900
( cuts engine )

02:39.293 --> 02:40.528
You lost,
stranger?

02:42.996 --> 02:46.600
Nomads ambushed a transport
a couple miles back.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.703
Killed all the cogs
except one.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.740
We don't deal
in human cargo here.

02:52.773 --> 02:53.974
What's your interest?

02:54.007 --> 02:56.810
The transport belonged
to my baron.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.813
( chuckles )

02:59.847 --> 03:01.515
Check it out, boys.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.617
We got a real live
Clipper here.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.486
( all chuckle )

03:07.020 --> 03:09.723
Don't you dogs
usually travel in packs?

03:09.757 --> 03:11.659
( chuckles )

03:14.362 --> 03:15.663
What's in the trunk?

03:23.003 --> 03:24.638
That's none
of your damn business.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.719
( grunting )

03:44.558 --> 03:46.660
( grunting )

03:51.865 --> 03:54.001
( yells )

03:57.671 --> 03:59.373
( groans )

03:59.407 --> 04:01.542
Ah!

04:02.976 --> 04:04.745
Man:
Get up. Get up.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.416
( neck snaps )

04:12.353 --> 04:13.887
- Let's go!
- Kill him!

04:35.409 --> 04:36.710
( grunts )

04:38.446 --> 04:39.713
- ( arm cracks )
- ( screams )

04:43.016 --> 04:45.018
- ( groans )
- ( bones crack )

04:45.052 --> 04:46.820
( yells )

04:49.390 --> 04:50.491
( groans )

04:53.661 --> 04:55.729
( groans )

05:05.573 --> 05:06.474
( grunting )

05:08.909 --> 05:10.344
( neck snaps )

05:10.378 --> 05:11.779
( bones crack )

05:14.415 --> 05:15.849
( screams )

05:30.631 --> 05:32.733
- ( bones cracking )
- ( screams )

05:32.766 --> 05:35.769
( groans )

05:37.037 --> 05:38.338
Ah!

06:24.718 --> 06:25.218
( birds chirping )

06:43.504 --> 06:45.005
( gasps )

06:57.818 --> 07:00.454
( flies buzzing )

07:02.723 --> 07:04.592
( grunts )

07:12.633 --> 07:14.802
( groans )

07:30.984 --> 07:32.853
Clipper:
There's nowhere
to go, kid.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.028
You want to tell me how you
ended up in that trunk

07:41.061 --> 07:42.696
and not dead
like the rest?

07:45.666 --> 07:47.067
Lucky, I guess.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.704
Lying to me
is a bad idea.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.609
Someone named the Widow
paid those nomads
to find me.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.081
That one's yours.

08:04.284 --> 08:07.187
( sighs )

08:07.220 --> 08:09.056
Her name was Sarah.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.625
She didn't deserve
to die this way.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.469
( grunts )

08:26.339 --> 08:28.175
So now
what happens to me?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.978
I'm taking you back
to the fort.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.580
Or you could let me go.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.682
What difference
would it make to you?

08:34.715 --> 08:37.951
You'll survive
a lot longer working in
my baron's poppy fields

08:37.985 --> 08:39.286
than you will out here.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.289
I'll take my chances.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.967
( grunts )

08:55.869 --> 08:57.571
You got a name?

08:57.605 --> 09:00.841
Or do you just show up,
kill people, and leave?

09:00.874 --> 09:03.844
If I tell you,
will you shut up?

09:03.877 --> 09:06.013
Can't make any promises.
( grunts )

09:07.615 --> 09:08.749
Sunny.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.151
- ( thunder rumbling )
- Sunny?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.855
Why, 'cause you brighten
everybody's day?

09:18.659 --> 09:19.893
Dig.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.834
( motorcycle approaching )

09:48.321 --> 09:50.624
( door rattling )

10:19.152 --> 10:22.622
( men shouting )

10:26.393 --> 10:28.161
- Man: Seven.
- ( men shout )

10:28.195 --> 10:29.863
- Eight.
- ( men shout )

10:29.897 --> 10:31.665
- Nine.
- ( men shout )

10:31.699 --> 10:33.166
- 10.
- ( men shout )

10:33.200 --> 10:35.035
- One.
- ( men shout )

10:35.068 --> 10:36.436
- Two.
- ( men shout )

10:36.469 --> 10:37.771
Three...

10:37.805 --> 10:40.007
Welcome to the fort, kid.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.809
- Man: Five.
- ( men shout )

10:41.842 --> 10:43.176
One.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.045
Regent present!

10:46.980 --> 10:48.916
- One!
- ( men shout )

10:48.949 --> 10:50.417
- Two.
- Sunny: Come on.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.752
- Three.
- ( men shout )

10:51.785 --> 10:52.986
Four!

10:53.020 --> 10:55.288
( crowd shouting )

11:01.795 --> 11:03.831
What is this?

11:03.864 --> 11:06.066
They're Colts.
Clippers in training.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.037
Every boy gets the chance
to join our ranks.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.139
No, thanks.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.008
Then you'll spend
the rest of your life
working in the fields.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.447
( siren wailing )

11:20.480 --> 11:22.916
Come on.
You're about
to meet the baron.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.285
He's welcoming
the new recruits.

11:37.965 --> 11:41.434
People once thought this
a holy book.

11:41.468 --> 11:44.805
They believed
it held the answers

11:44.838 --> 11:48.375
from a god
that would save them.

11:48.408 --> 11:52.846
Boys, there is no god
in the Badlands.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.182
How do I know?

11:55.215 --> 11:58.451
A god does not feed you
or clothe you

11:58.485 --> 12:00.387
or protect you.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.422
I do.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.925
Most of you are orphans.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.394
Your parents died
after a life of servitude

12:07.427 --> 12:10.297
and left you
to pay off their debt.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.833
But I'm offering you
a different path.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.902
The strongest
among you

12:14.935 --> 12:16.336
will have
the opportunity

12:16.369 --> 12:20.007
to train
as one of my Clippers.

12:20.040 --> 12:24.144
Some see Clippers
as cold, heartless killers.

12:24.177 --> 12:28.381
But the men
that fill this fort
are more than that.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.851
They're my family.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.954
Once you're accepted
into my family,

12:33.987 --> 12:36.389
there is no other family.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.859
Boys, I'm not
asking you to be monks.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.460
You can wick
whatever you want.

12:40.493 --> 12:44.564
But a Clipper's loyalty
is to his baron.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.267
That's the first rule
of our code.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.370
In return,
you get the best
of everything--

12:50.403 --> 12:54.274
food, weapons, women.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.243
( boys chuckle )

12:56.276 --> 12:57.845
Come here, Sunny.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.248
Remove the vest.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.922
Quite a sight,
isn't it?

13:08.956 --> 13:12.192
Each mark
represents a life,

13:12.225 --> 13:15.328
a life that Sunny
has taken

13:15.362 --> 13:18.565
without remorse,
without regret.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.901
Because he kills
for one reason,

13:20.934 --> 13:22.169
and what is that, Sunny?

13:22.202 --> 13:23.971
To protect
your interests, Baron.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.338
That's right.

13:25.372 --> 13:28.942
To protect
my interests, Baron.

13:28.976 --> 13:33.513
404 souls,
all taken for me.

13:33.546 --> 13:36.083
No Clipper
in the Badlands

13:36.116 --> 13:39.920
is more feared
or more loyal.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.990
This man standing here
is a far cry

13:43.023 --> 13:47.394
from the miserable whelp
I laid eyes on all
those years ago.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.629
Sunny was found
naked and shivering

13:49.662 --> 13:52.165
down by the Rabbit River,

13:52.199 --> 13:55.202
no parents, no past,

13:55.235 --> 13:57.004
no name.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.007
I figured if the Badlands
hadn't killed him,

14:00.040 --> 14:02.943
there must be
a strength inside him,

14:02.976 --> 14:04.344
so I took him in,

14:04.377 --> 14:08.882
forged him into the man
you see today.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.220
Maybe the boy

14:13.253 --> 14:15.622
who will follow
in his footsteps

14:15.655 --> 14:18.625
is in this room.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.096
Is it you?

14:24.664 --> 14:26.099
Or you?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.169
Or you?

14:32.172 --> 14:35.342
Now, I ask,

14:35.375 --> 14:37.510
do you want to be
part of my family?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.246
All:
Yes, sir!

14:39.279 --> 14:41.348
Baron:
Do you want the best
of everything?

14:41.381 --> 14:42.916
All:
Yes, Baron.

14:42.950 --> 14:45.518
Do you want
to kill in my name?

14:45.552 --> 14:46.987
All:
Yes, Baron.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.456
Your future has begun.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.109
Tell me why the Widow's
so interested in you.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.182
I don't know, Baron.

15:21.054 --> 15:24.357
You know what happens
to people who keep
secrets from me?

15:27.594 --> 15:30.230
Get him in the pit.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.032
Let's see what
you're made of.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.338
- Keep an eye on the boy.
- Yes, Baron.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.574
Father, I was handling
the nomad problem.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.077
Why did you send in Sunny
without telling me?

15:44.111 --> 15:47.047
Turns out nomads weren't
the real problem.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.649
The Widow was paying them
to do her dirty work.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.155
Another baron
is moving against us.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.090
Just because she
murdered her husband

15:57.124 --> 15:58.391
does not
make her a baron.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.160
Call her
what you want.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.195
Our poppy
can't be processed

16:02.229 --> 16:03.663
without her oil
to run the factory.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.465
You want to wait
for her to choke us off?

16:05.498 --> 16:07.600
If we strike,
we'll be starting a war

16:07.634 --> 16:09.502
with the other
five barons.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.204
If we do nothing,
we'll look weak

16:11.238 --> 16:12.772
and they'll
come after us anyway.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.675
We do not move
on the Widow.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.179
Thank you, Sunny.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.153
( boys shouting )

16:46.439 --> 16:47.640
What's this?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.109
Give it back.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.443
It's mine now.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.783
( boys shouting )

16:56.816 --> 16:59.419
- You little shit.
- Get off.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.622
- That's mine!
- Back off.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.357
( panting )

17:04.391 --> 17:05.658
Give me that.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.809
Get out of here.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.188
Be careful.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.460
Guys like Ajax
start fights to show off
for the Clippers.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.530
They want
to be picked as Colts.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.268
I'm Bale.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.702
M.K.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.740
You watch my back,
I'll watch yours.

18:20.367 --> 18:23.603
Jacobee
sends his regrets.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.839
He's the third baron
to do so.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.675
When you and I
got married,

18:28.708 --> 18:30.777
none would have dared
decline the invitation.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.313
Lydia, you offered to handle
the wedding arrangements,

18:33.346 --> 18:34.881
but if it's too much
of a burden...

18:34.914 --> 18:38.218
Oh, please,
I'm beyond jealousy
at this point.

18:38.251 --> 18:41.321
Marry Jade,
your cog bride.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.656
Take as many wives
as you want.

18:53.766 --> 18:57.270
( high-pitched whine )

19:05.778 --> 19:07.747
Lydia:
Another headache?

19:07.780 --> 19:10.617
I blame
this one on you.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.752
You need to rest,

19:12.785 --> 19:14.921
let Ryder take
some of the load.

19:14.954 --> 19:18.758
We talked about giving him
more responsibility.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.527
So that's
what this is about?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.795
Are you planning
a wedding or a wake?

19:22.829 --> 19:25.432
He's gonna
succeed you one day.

19:25.465 --> 19:28.635
Power is not inherited,
Lydia, it's taken.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.238
Perhaps you'd prefer
if he cut your head off.

19:31.271 --> 19:34.374
I wish he would.
I've spent years
trying to groom him.

19:34.407 --> 19:37.377
Try harder.
He's your only son.

19:37.410 --> 19:40.447
Yeah, well, we both know
he's not up to the task.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.687
After everything
that boy sacrificed...

19:47.720 --> 19:49.222
for you,

19:49.256 --> 19:51.858
I will not let you
abandon him again.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.463
He's stronger
than you think.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.443
( cracks )

20:25.558 --> 20:26.659
No!

20:42.575 --> 20:44.444
What did you take
from that boy?

20:48.848 --> 20:50.417
You ever
seen this before?

20:50.450 --> 20:53.420
No.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.724
You need to reconsider
your position.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.792
We have to move
against the Widow.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.361
Your father
made his decision.

21:01.394 --> 21:05.632
No, you made the decision.
He agreed, like always.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.538
He's not himself.
I know you see it, too.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.873
The headaches.
We have to protect him.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.808
I have always
protected him.

21:15.842 --> 21:19.479
By doing nothing,
you're digging his grave.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.883
I'll hold on to this.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.764
( humming )

21:37.797 --> 21:39.932
Baron: Jade?

21:53.780 --> 21:57.950
Must be hard for you
to see them like that.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.752
Your father's a baron.

21:59.786 --> 22:02.455
He's free to take
as many wives
as he wants.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.758
Ryder:
Don't pretend
it doesn't hurt, Mother.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.628
I know it does.

22:08.661 --> 22:13.466
He needs me, Ryder.
And he always will.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.502
I still have
his head and his heart.

22:15.535 --> 22:19.806
I gladly bequeath to her
everything to the south.

22:37.824 --> 22:40.693
( overlapping chatter )

22:58.645 --> 23:00.547
( bell chimes )

23:06.719 --> 23:09.722
It will never
be the real thing,
but you'll get used to it.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.936
Don't worry.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.938
He's not here for you.

23:25.972 --> 23:31.644
"...what in me is dark

23:31.678 --> 23:34.146
i-illum"--
( sighs )

23:38.718 --> 23:40.920
I like "Cat in the Hat"
better.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.523
You know,
three months ago,

23:43.556 --> 23:45.091
you couldn't
read your own name.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.993
And now
you're getting picky.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.906
What's wrong?

24:01.007 --> 24:02.809
Nothing.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.612
You can tell me.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.852
I'm pregnant.

24:17.557 --> 24:18.925
How long?

24:20.660 --> 24:23.062
Long enough
to be sure.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.600
( sighs )

24:37.810 --> 24:39.078
Say something.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.082
You can't keep it.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.187
Is that the only way
you solve a problem?

24:49.922 --> 24:51.057
Kill it?

24:51.090 --> 24:53.560
Veil, the punishment
is death.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.261
You understand that,
right?

24:55.294 --> 24:57.029
I know the consequences.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.931
That's not what
I'm talking about.

24:58.965 --> 25:01.901
Do you even
want to keep it?

25:13.279 --> 25:15.915
We need to leave
the Badlands.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.651
And go where?

25:18.685 --> 25:20.620
I've heard stories.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.655
The ones
who've tried to escape,

25:22.689 --> 25:24.824
Quinn has hunted
them down and killed them.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.059
I've heard stories, Sunny.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.061
There are places
beyond these borders.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.664
They're just stories.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.800
There's nothing out there.

25:33.833 --> 25:36.903
This is a life
you helped create.

25:40.239 --> 25:42.975
Does that mean
something to you?

25:53.686 --> 25:56.188
I know

25:56.222 --> 25:58.891
buried under
all this ink...

26:01.360 --> 26:02.895
is a good man.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.035
You're wrong.

26:18.945 --> 26:21.748
Thought you told
Veil you was giving
that stuff up.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.352
Apparently, I lied.

26:26.385 --> 26:29.956
You know,
there used to be a time
when you were, uh, excited

26:29.989 --> 26:32.158
about coming in here
and getting your next mark.

26:32.191 --> 26:35.094
Don't take it
personally, Ringo.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.096
- I don't.
- ( needle humming )

26:37.129 --> 26:39.398
Just seen it before.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.968
Killing that many people
takes a toll on a man.

26:42.001 --> 26:44.671
Even you, Sunny.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.708
( quiet chatter )

27:07.927 --> 27:09.762
We have
unfinished business.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.031
You embarrassed me
in front of the regent.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.185
( grunts )

27:40.392 --> 27:42.895
( screaming )

27:57.977 --> 27:58.544
( crickets chirping )

28:08.821 --> 28:10.122
( gasps )

28:16.162 --> 28:18.064
What happened
in that bathroom?

28:18.097 --> 28:20.800
I've never seen
anything like that before.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.337
That's why
the Widow was looking
for you, right?

28:32.779 --> 28:34.881
If I told Quinn
what I saw,

28:34.914 --> 28:38.184
he would turn you
into something you
don't want to be.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.019
I need the truth.

28:41.420 --> 28:44.824
I don't know
what that is.

28:44.857 --> 28:47.994
It happens
when I bleed.

28:48.027 --> 28:50.229
Ever since I was little,
it's been this way.

28:51.931 --> 28:56.068
It's like something
takes control of me.

28:56.102 --> 28:59.138
When I wake up,
someone's been hurt
or worse.

29:01.173 --> 29:04.110
It's my fault
my mother and I
had to leave our home.

29:04.143 --> 29:08.414
My mother had heard
about a healer who
could fix me.

29:08.447 --> 29:11.818
When we went to find him,
we were caught by nomads
and separated.

29:11.851 --> 29:14.053
I've been looking
for her ever since.

29:22.862 --> 29:26.498
That's my home.
That's Azra.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.367
Azra?

29:28.400 --> 29:30.136
Yes, it's beyond
the Badlands.

29:30.169 --> 29:32.438
Where did you
get that?

29:32.471 --> 29:33.873
Do you remember
how to get there?

29:35.541 --> 29:39.245
No, I-- I don't.
It was a long time ago.

29:43.415 --> 29:46.853
Look, can I please
just get my pendant back?

29:46.886 --> 29:49.421
It's the last thing
I have to remember
my mother.

29:52.024 --> 29:54.060
The baron's son took it.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.129
Well, I'm getting it back

29:57.163 --> 29:59.398
Don't be stupid.

29:59.431 --> 30:02.801
Go back to the barracks
and keep your head down.
Understood?

30:13.212 --> 30:15.347
( thunder rumbling )

31:06.698 --> 31:09.902
( thunder rumbling )

32:15.567 --> 32:17.669
( groans )

32:41.693 --> 32:43.062
( groans )

32:56.708 --> 32:58.210
( man groans )

32:59.345 --> 33:01.347
( yells )

33:07.819 --> 33:09.355
( grunting )

34:05.111 --> 34:07.213
( gurgles )

34:20.592 --> 34:23.162
( car door opens )

34:26.898 --> 34:30.302
Valentine, be a peach
and wait in the car.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.747
You really are
as good as they say.

34:41.780 --> 34:45.117
Sunny:
I should kill you
where you stand.

34:45.151 --> 34:47.386
We both know you can't.

34:47.419 --> 34:49.188
I'm a baron.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.359
Now that I got
your attention,

34:53.392 --> 34:55.327
there's a boy
in the fort.

34:55.361 --> 34:57.563
He has a pendant
with this symbol on it.

34:57.596 --> 35:00.366
Bring him to me.

35:00.399 --> 35:01.767
That's not gonna happen.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.138
You think you kill
for Quinn out of loyalty,

35:06.172 --> 35:07.739
but I know that's
not the real reason.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.712
Let me know when
you change your mind.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.630
( Bale whispering )
You're crazy.
It's not worth the risk.

35:31.663 --> 35:34.366
M.K.:
It is to me.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.403
Okay, look, my sister's
a house cook.

35:37.436 --> 35:41.373
Ryder's room
is on the second floor,
first door.

35:41.407 --> 35:43.275
Got it.
Thanks.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.647
Just don't
let him catch you.

35:52.418 --> 35:55.221
( crickets chirping )

36:31.022 --> 36:32.258
- ( grunts )
- Lydia: Ryder?

36:36.328 --> 36:38.664
I caught this little shit
red-handed.

36:44.670 --> 36:45.971
Where did you get this?

36:46.004 --> 36:48.474
It's mine.

36:48.507 --> 36:51.243
Ryder:
I'll take him out back
and cage him.

36:51.277 --> 36:54.513
Execute him in front
of the new cogs
in the morning.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.937
Go away.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.840
I told you to stay
in the barracks.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.450
Who gave you
that compass?

37:37.323 --> 37:38.624
It doesn't matter.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.392
You kept it
for a reason.

37:40.426 --> 37:43.529
You're hoping Azra's
out there, too.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.398
You're going to die
in the morning.

37:46.432 --> 37:47.699
You know that,
don't you?

37:52.404 --> 37:53.672
( voice quivers )

37:53.705 --> 37:55.341
Sunny, could you
promise me something?

37:59.578 --> 38:02.614
Somehow, could you
find my mom?

38:02.648 --> 38:04.483
Tell her
that I'm sorry?

38:06.452 --> 38:09.921
I tried to find her.
I never gave up.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.625
And that I love her.

38:15.994 --> 38:19.431
I'll never be able
to keep that promise, kid.

38:26.905 --> 38:29.375
( M.K. sniffling )

38:43.088 --> 38:45.791
Find your mom
and tell her yourself.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.602
( quietly )
This is your way out.

38:56.635 --> 38:59.037
If you get caught,
you will be killed.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.643
Why are you helping me?

39:04.676 --> 39:07.713
Because I never
had a choice.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.481
Now you do.

39:11.149 --> 39:12.518
Thank you.

39:12.551 --> 39:14.352
Now go.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.924
( gasps )

39:46.685 --> 39:48.454
Sunny.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.158
Baron's looking for you.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.062
( knock on door )

40:05.136 --> 40:07.038
I caught you, Sunny.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.414
I saw you on the wall
staring out.

40:19.818 --> 40:24.022
I've seen that look before.
I've had it myself.

40:24.055 --> 40:25.924
But there's
nothing out there.

40:25.957 --> 40:29.060
You can
trust me on that.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.563
( sizzling )

40:33.565 --> 40:35.634
( Quinn exhales )

40:35.667 --> 40:38.604
I want you to move
closer to the house.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.739
One of the cottages
right here.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.843
I'm more at home
in the barracks
with my men.

40:44.876 --> 40:47.078
I appreciate that, Sunny.

40:47.112 --> 40:50.882
But I'd feel safer
knowing you were closer
to me and my family.

40:52.618 --> 40:53.985
Consider it done.

41:04.029 --> 41:06.197
I know the other barons
are coming for me.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.502
But they will never
take this fort.

41:10.536 --> 41:14.072
And you and I
are the only ones
who can defend it.

41:17.676 --> 41:20.245
Ryder is not gonna
be happy about this.

41:20.278 --> 41:22.981
Family's trouble,
Sunny.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.683
( chuckles )

41:24.716 --> 41:26.952
You're lucky
you'll never have one.

41:41.867 --> 41:43.969
( thunder rumbling )

41:45.604 --> 41:47.873
"Lead Me Home" playing

42:04.255 --> 42:06.692
* Oh, Lord,
live inside me *

42:06.725 --> 42:08.960
* Lead me on my way

42:08.994 --> 42:11.096
* Oh, Lord,
live inside me *

42:11.129 --> 42:12.964
* Lead me on my way

42:12.998 --> 42:17.268
* Lead me home

42:17.302 --> 42:18.970
* Lead me home

42:22.608 --> 42:24.610
* Oh, Lord,
in the darkness *

42:24.643 --> 42:26.978
* Lead me on my way

42:27.012 --> 42:29.247
* Oh, Lord,
in the darkness *

42:29.280 --> 42:30.982
* Lead me on my way

42:31.016 --> 42:35.621
* Lead me home

42:35.654 --> 42:37.656
* Lead me home

42:40.225 --> 42:44.663
* Mm-mmm

42:44.696 --> 42:46.564
* Mmm

42:49.901 --> 42:53.639
* Mm-mmm

42:53.672 --> 42:55.641
* Mmm

42:59.244 --> 43:01.613
* Oh, Lord,
heaven's waiting *

43:01.647 --> 43:03.915
* Open up your door

43:03.949 --> 43:06.151
* Oh, Lord,
heaven's waiting *

43:06.184 --> 43:07.753
* Open up your door

43:07.786 --> 43:12.924
* Lead me home

43:12.958 --> 43:15.126
* Lead me home.

43:18.129 --> 43:23.134
( theme music playing )
