00:43.800 --> 00:45.450
Okay.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.380
Okay, I know, I know. I'm sorry.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.209
I know it's a little tender.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.447
Hmm.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.771
Okay, let's try your voice now.

01:01.080 --> 01:04.971
My name is Katniss Everdeen.
I'm from District 12.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.060
- "My...
- Okay, take your time.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.766
Still got a lot of swelling
in your vocal chords.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.247
"My...

01:18.640 --> 01:22.326
name is...

01:22.560 --> 01:26.645
Katniss Everdeen."

01:30.680 --> 01:32.728
I want...

01:33.640 --> 01:36.007
I want to talk to him.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.325
He needs time.

01:40.560 --> 01:44.246
But, um, we're trying somethin' new today.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.500
He's been calmer with the doctors,

01:46.600 --> 01:49.660
but they're strangers to him.

01:49.760 --> 01:53.808
So we're gonna test his response
on someone he remembers from home.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.650
Someone he trusts.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.321
Send her in.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.380
Hey.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.100
Prim.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.820
How you feelin'?

02:26.920 --> 02:30.060
- She's too close.
- Mmm, it's okay.

02:30.160 --> 02:32.420
- How'd you get here?
- We live in District 13 now.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.180
It's a real place. Stories are true.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.169
You were rescued.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.924
My family hasn't come to see me.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.340
There was an attack on 12.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.680
Yes.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.207
My family?

02:52.920 --> 02:54.922
The bakery didn't survive.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.326
It's Katniss.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.980
- It's because of Katniss.
- Wasn't because of her.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.500
- She tell you to say that?
- She didn't tell me anything.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.900
She's a liar, Prim. It's a trick.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.288
Peeta, what you're saying isn't real.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.500
She sent you here to talk to me.

03:32.600 --> 03:33.940
- She knows you're here now.
- It's okay.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.980
She knows... You can't trust her!

03:36.080 --> 03:37.540
She's a monster!

03:37.640 --> 03:40.166
She's a mutt that The Capitol
created to destroy us!

03:40.280 --> 03:42.220
- Get her outta there.
- Do you understand me?

03:42.320 --> 03:46.120
You have to kill her, Prim!
You have to kill her!

03:46.920 --> 03:48.445
- Katniss?
- She's a mutt!

03:49.880 --> 03:52.300
This is just a conditioned response.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.140
- Kill her!
- It's not him.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.700
She's a monster! She's a mutt!

03:55.800 --> 03:57.689
- No, it's not him.
- She's a mutt!

04:07.240 --> 04:09.620
There's not enough
manpower coming in from 4.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.220
I don't think that's a problem.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.300
Please, come in.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.420
With any kind of manpower, if we...

04:14.520 --> 04:16.060
Will you excuse us for just a moment?

04:16.160 --> 04:17.649
Of course.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.321
Have a seat.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.044
I'm glad you're feeling better.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.340
Snow has to pay for what he's done.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.420
I wanna help the rebels in any way I can.

04:37.520 --> 04:38.940
It's hard to see Peeta this way.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.405
That's not Peeta.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.820
Send me to The Capitol. I'll do anything.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.160
I can't...

04:51.680 --> 04:53.569
I can't send you there.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.460
We can't get into The Capitol
until we control District 2.

04:57.560 --> 04:58.686
Then send me to 2.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.860
You want me to fire up our troops?

05:01.960 --> 05:04.088
Call out to the loyalists?
You've seen what I can do.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.010
Yes, I have.

05:48.920 --> 05:52.420
I saw Peeta... before we left.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.124
And what did you think?

05:55.240 --> 05:57.049
Something selfish.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.641
That you don't have to be
jealous of him anymore.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.365
No.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.251
I don't stand a chance
if he doesn't get better.

06:13.360 --> 06:14.486
You'll never let him go.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.604
What's goin' on in your head?

06:41.120 --> 06:42.770
I don't know.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.201
That's like kissing someone who's drunk.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.406
Doesn't count.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.580
30 minutes until touchdown.

06:58.680 --> 06:59.886
Prepare for landing.

07:04.240 --> 07:07.323
Wrap it up. Cut the chatter. Let's go.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.180
This is another version
of booby-trapping a resource.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.820
- Right, I see.
- This one's designed to blind.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.100
Smoke clings to the eyes.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.500
That's an application
of the hummingbird trap.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.500
You scare people
so they flee in this direction

07:18.600 --> 07:20.660
into what they think is a safe haven.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.220
Two-tiered explosion.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.940
You allow people enough time
to rush in, help the wounded, then...

07:25.040 --> 07:27.646
- A second bomb.
- Right.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.820
Second one goes off here.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.284
I guess there are no rules anymore about
what a person can do to another person.

07:35.240 --> 07:38.369
I don't think Snow used any
rulebook when he hijacked Peeta.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.780
Welcome to District 2. I'm Corporal Homes.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.484
You follow me, please.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.700
Don't worry.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.167
It's just how the loyalists
say "Good morning."

08:15.920 --> 08:19.002
President Coin, we're indebted to you
for the reinforcements and the Mockingjay.

08:19.960 --> 08:23.580
But I'm not sure that anyone outside
of 2 knows what we've been up against.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.980
This is The Nut.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.700
The Capitol's headquarters
for all offensive operations.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.620
It's manned by both military
and civilian personnel from District 2.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.340
As you can see,

08:34.440 --> 08:38.100
the fortress lies so far beneath
the bedrock, it's untouchable.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.645
Yesterday, we attempted
to take the northeastern gate.

08:41.240 --> 08:44.369
The enemy countered from higher up
and we were forced to pull back.

08:45.520 --> 08:46.980
We took heavy losses.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.765
Could we create a decoy?
Send troops towards one gate,

08:49.880 --> 08:51.980
launch a staggered attack on another.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.980
Whose troops do you propose
as a decoy, commander?

08:54.080 --> 08:57.527
We have the Mockingjay.
Don't underestimate her.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.660
We could use her to erode support.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.300
She may be able to sway
some of the loyalists.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.740
You've been underground
a long time, Madam Coin.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.683
This isn't like the rest of Panem.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.980
Support for The Capitol runs deep here.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.560
Then there is no sacrifice too great.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.660
We need to control the arsenal
inside that fortress.

09:17.760 --> 09:21.660
Even with every district in this alliance,
we are outgunned.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.891
I won't commit my people to a ground
assault just to pillage weapons.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.843
Commander Paylor,
your people have suffered

09:26.960 --> 09:29.140
more than just about anyone else
at the hands of The Capitol.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.820
Which is why I won't
condone a mass suicide.

09:30.920 --> 09:33.540
If we don't take District 2,
we won't get into The Capitol.

09:33.640 --> 09:37.440
Would it be enough to disable
the fortress... instead of taking it?

09:38.440 --> 09:39.680
What do you have in mind?

09:41.600 --> 09:43.060
You think of it like a wolf den.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.940
You're not gonna fight your way in,
so you've got two choices:

09:46.040 --> 09:48.700
You trap the wolves inside,
or you flush 'em out.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.100
If we can't attack straight on,

09:50.200 --> 09:53.260
then couldn't we use our hovercraft to
strike around it? We'll use the mountains.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.486
We'll hit weak spots in the peaks.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.980
We could design the bomb targets
in sequence using seismic data.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.491
Trigger avalanches.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.100
Block all exits, cut off their supplies.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.820
You make it impossible for them
to launch their hovercraft.

10:02.920 --> 10:04.660
Bury them alive.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.060
We'd forfeit any chance
to control the weapons.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.660
Yes, but we'd face a weakened Capitol.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.410
There's civilians in there.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.448
They should be given
a chance to surrender.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.900
Could use one of the supply
tunnels for the evacuees.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.500
It's a luxury we weren't given
when they firebombed 12.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.700
There's gotta be a better way.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.940
I suggest we try the avalanche,
but leave the train tunnel alone.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.940
Civilians can escape into the square,

10:27.040 --> 10:28.820
where our armies will be
waiting for their surrender.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.287
We should have every
available medic standing by.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.140
And if they won't surrender?

10:33.240 --> 10:36.020
Then we will need a compelling voice...

10:36.120 --> 10:37.884
to persuade them.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.540
Red flag, this is blue leader.

10:55.640 --> 10:58.166
Form up on Charlie Tango,
1,500 meters out.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.811
All bombers are outbound.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.860
What's the difference, Katniss?

11:08.960 --> 11:12.180
Crushing the enemy in a mine or blowin' them
outta the sky with one of Beetee's arrows.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.420
It's the same thing.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.761
We were under attack in District 8,

11:17.280 --> 11:19.260
and that hovercraft
wasn't filled with civilians.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.900
Doesn't matter.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.490
Even if those civilians are just moppin'
floors, they're helping the enemy.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.363
And if they have to die,
I can live with that.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.380
No one who supports
The Capitol is innocent.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.700
With that kinda thinking,
you can kill whoever you want.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.765
You can send kids off to The Hunger Games
to keep the districts in line.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.168
It's war, Katniss.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.289
Sometimes killing isn't personal.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.660
Figured if anyone knew that, it was you.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.889
I, of all people, know
that it's always personal.

12:27.800 --> 12:31.122
Don't worry, Katniss,
there'll be survivors.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.820
Let's focus on what it is you gotta say.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.780
Now, Plutarch wrote a speech for you...

12:35.880 --> 12:36.860
I'm not saying that.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.531
Okay. Didn't think so. Let's, uh...

12:40.520 --> 12:42.660
But just remember,
you're talking to everybody.

12:42.760 --> 12:46.940
Not just the rebels, but The Capitol,
the survivors in 2.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.260
We want them to lay down their arms.

12:49.360 --> 12:53.127
So you might wanna experiment
with a little sensitivity, warmth.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.523
Make it quick, you're exposed.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.340
This is Katniss Everdeen,

13:22.440 --> 13:25.091
speaking to all of the loyalists
from the heart of District 2.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.580
Survivors! Inbound!

13:26.680 --> 13:28.569
Ready! Ready! Guns up!

13:30.800 --> 13:32.802
On the ready. Guns up!

13:33.800 --> 13:35.370
We gotta get you back.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.611
Here they come!

13:39.120 --> 13:40.531
Weapons tight! Weapons tight!

13:42.040 --> 13:44.088
Everybody, stand by!

13:47.760 --> 13:49.820
On the ground!

13:49.920 --> 13:51.940
Put your weapons down.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.740
Get on the ground!

13:53.840 --> 13:55.940
Put your weapons down now!

13:56.040 --> 13:58.122
Weapons down!

13:59.000 --> 14:01.241
You! Put it down!

14:01.360 --> 14:03.020
Put it...

14:03.120 --> 14:04.860
- Put your weapons down!
- Drop it!

14:04.960 --> 14:07.850
Drop your weapon! You! Drop it.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.380
Drop the gun!

14:10.480 --> 14:11.860
Drop it!

14:11.960 --> 14:13.340
- Hold your fire!
- Stop!

14:13.440 --> 14:15.060
Stop!

14:15.160 --> 14:17.220
- Hold your fire!
- Stop!

14:17.320 --> 14:19.100
- Hold your fire!
- He needs help!

14:19.200 --> 14:20.725
Hold your fire!

14:21.600 --> 14:22.931
Drop it!

14:25.440 --> 14:27.460
Give me one reason I shouldn't shoot you.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.686
Drop the gun!

14:37.920 --> 14:39.331
I can't.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.969
I guess that's the problem, isn't it?

14:46.880 --> 14:48.291
We blew up your mine.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.722
You burned my district to the ground.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.251
We each have every reason
to want to kill each other.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.124
So if you wanna kill me, do it.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.980
Make Snow happy.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.050
I'm tired of killing his slaves for him.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.282
I'm not his slave.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.405
I am.

15:13.520 --> 15:15.170
That's why I killed Cato.

15:16.560 --> 15:17.971
And he killed Thresh.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.530
And Thresh killed Clove.

15:21.960 --> 15:24.900
It just goes around and around.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.126
And who wins?

15:27.200 --> 15:29.567
Always Snow.

15:30.520 --> 15:34.127
I am done being a piece in his game.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.444
District 12, District 2. We have no fight.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.967
Except the one The Capitol gave us.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.643
Why are you fighting the rebels?

15:47.400 --> 15:48.686
You're neighbors.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.441
You're family.

16:11.720 --> 16:15.964
These people are not your enemy.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.088
We all have one enemy.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.689
And that's Snow.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.569
He corrupts everyone and everything.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.682
He turns the best of us
against each other.

16:32.480 --> 16:35.131
Stop killing for him.

16:37.400 --> 16:42.167
Tonight, turn your weapons to The Capitol.

16:44.160 --> 16:47.050
Turn your weapons to Snow.

16:49.160 --> 16:54.530
Tonight, turn your weapons to The Capitol.

16:55.760 --> 16:59.162
Turn your weapons to Snow.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.326
Hold your fire.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.650
A toast.

17:15.599 --> 17:20.740
Antonius, with our best troops
crushed in the mountains

17:20.839 --> 17:23.780
and the rebels marching on us as we speak,

17:23.880 --> 17:25.450
what did we celebrate?

17:27.520 --> 17:29.887
The death of the Mockingjay, sir.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.761
If Peeta didn't kill her,
her own arrogance did.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.460
Of course.

17:50.560 --> 17:53.380
That's the same facile thinking

17:53.480 --> 17:57.405
that led you to divert our best
Peacekeepers into District 2.

17:58.680 --> 18:02.020
You have a habit of burying
people before they're dead.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.260
If the Mockingjay were gone,

18:04.360 --> 18:07.603
the rebels would already be
using her as a martyr.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.846
No, Minister Antonius,

18:12.560 --> 18:16.020
I'm afraid that is not
what we were toasting at all.

18:16.120 --> 18:19.841
Sir, the rebels can be held off out...

18:24.200 --> 18:28.729
The rebels will reach the outskirts
of The Capitol in a matter of days.

18:29.680 --> 18:34.242
We'll evacuate the outer
blocks to let them in.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.340
I want all anti-aircraft defenses ready,

18:38.440 --> 18:40.920
so we're secure from the skies.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.900
Lure them into the city,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.100
and then our Gamemakers

18:46.200 --> 18:49.124
will make them pay
for every inch with blood.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.340
I want every camera watching.

18:53.440 --> 18:57.001
We'll turn their advance into
a celebration of suffering.

18:58.520 --> 19:02.684
Let each moment be captured
for all posterity.

19:05.440 --> 19:09.889
So, what did we toast tonight,
Minister Antonius?

19:12.800 --> 19:15.167
We toasted a glorious era...

19:17.240 --> 19:20.005
coming to its bitter end.

19:27.520 --> 19:31.047
Well, there she is. The Mockingjay.

19:32.680 --> 19:36.048
Oh, that speech you gave. Oh, man, feel.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.401
I mean, I still have goose bumps.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.860
You don't mind, do you?

19:41.960 --> 19:43.860
They cut off my supply of morphling.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.380
There's this head doctor that
comes in and sees me every day,

19:46.480 --> 19:48.500
trying to help me adjust to reality.

19:48.600 --> 19:52.180
Like some guy from this rabbit's warren

19:52.280 --> 19:54.362
actually knows anything about my reality.

19:59.360 --> 20:02.921
At least 20 times in a session,
he tells me that I'm totally safe.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.009
Safe from The Capitol.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.090
Safe from Snow.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.500
What about you, Mockingjay?
You feeling totally safe?

20:13.600 --> 20:16.420
- Till I got shot.
- Oh, please.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.580
The bullet didn't even touch you.

20:18.680 --> 20:21.900
Cinna saw to that. Of course,
your costume would be bulletproof.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.048
So what are your injuries?

20:25.920 --> 20:28.540
Bruised ribs, bruised lung.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.246
I'm surprised they haven't
found you a new lung.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.047
I mean, I've got two.
Do you want one of mine?

20:35.600 --> 20:37.900
I mean, it's everybody's job
to keep you alive.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.820
- Is that why you hate me?
- Partly.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.500
You're also a little hard to swallow.

20:43.600 --> 20:47.820
The whole tacky romance drama
and the "defender of the hopeless" act.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.740
Even though it's not an act.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.922
Which makes it even more unbearable.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.367
Feel free to take any of this personally.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.244
You should have been the Mockingjay.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.860
Nobody else would tell you what to say.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.724
But nobody likes me.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.300
- They're afraid of you.
- Maybe here,

21:05.400 --> 21:08.340
but... in The Capitol,
you're the only thing

21:08.440 --> 21:09.930
that they're scared of.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.089
It's just stuff my family brought.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.131
It's from Peeta.

21:31.680 --> 21:32.841
Yeah.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.921
They messed us up
pretty good, didn't they?

21:44.680 --> 21:47.081
We showed him footage of your speech in 2.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.460
He had real memories of you.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.740
That still doesn't mean
I'm going in there.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.500
He's strapped down. He can't hurt you.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.340
No. This is different. Haymitch,
I really don't want to.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.807
It doesn't matter what you want.
It's for Peeta.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.923
What's the harm in trying?

22:18.760 --> 22:20.000
I watched you die.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.129
- You look terrible.
- You've looked better.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.860
You're not even remotely nice
to say that to me now.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.486
I was never the nice one. You were.

22:33.280 --> 22:37.569
When I saw you die,
I remembered something.

22:38.280 --> 22:39.520
About the bread.

22:40.560 --> 22:44.007
I remember... you in the rain.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.811
And I burned it on purpose.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.170
To give it to you.

22:54.440 --> 22:57.284
I remember my mother hitting me.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.100
I was supposed to give it to the pig.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.646
That was the first we'd eaten in days.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.460
Why would I take
a beating like that for you?

23:05.560 --> 23:09.531
Because you were kind and generous.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.804
- And people said you loved me.
- Did people say you love me?

23:16.080 --> 23:20.220
They said that's why Snow
tortured you. To hurt me.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.641
Snow says that everything that
comes out of your mouth is a lie.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.284
All I know is that I would have
saved myself a lot of suffering,

23:30.720 --> 23:32.722
if I'd just given that bread to the pig.

23:54.840 --> 23:58.162
I think the only thing left
to say is "thank you."

23:59.920 --> 24:01.620
I need to be in The Capitol.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.660
No, you have done your job.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.220
You've been very successful
as the Mockingjay.

24:06.320 --> 24:10.325
You've unified the districts.
And now we want you to rest.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.329
And to heal.

24:12.440 --> 24:14.660
The last the rebels saw me,
I was lying on the ground.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.491
Katniss, we won't let this
momentum go to waste.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.220
We'll shoot more propos right here in 13,

24:20.320 --> 24:21.860
showing them that you're alive.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.100
I should be with the troops.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.220
It'll be like being on the front lines.

24:25.320 --> 24:26.620
As far as the soldiers know,

24:26.720 --> 24:29.660
you survived a bullet to the heart.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.127
I think they'll understand
why you're not with them.

24:32.240 --> 24:36.540
When we win this war,
we'll fly you in for the surrender.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.005
We'll need you for the ceremony.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.122
You're very valuable to us.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.641
I'll do whatever you need me to do.

24:47.240 --> 24:51.820
From this day forth,
in sickness and in health,

24:51.920 --> 24:54.924
for richer or poorer.

24:55.480 --> 25:00.042
I promise to love
and cherish you each day.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.328
I, Finnick Odair,

25:03.960 --> 25:08.204
take you, Annie Cresta,
as my wife from this day forth.

25:09.440 --> 25:13.940
Together or apart,
we will always be united.

25:14.040 --> 25:19.100
One life, one purpose, one destiny.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.770
You may kiss the bride.

25:58.320 --> 26:01.164
You saw Peeta, didn't you?

26:02.240 --> 26:04.180
Did you tell him "Hi" for me?

26:04.280 --> 26:06.260
We're old friends, you know.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.220
We had adjoining cells in The Capitol.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.926
We're very familiar
with each other's screams.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.444
I'm going to kill Snow.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.201
Nothing good is safe while he's alive.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.487
And I can't make another speech about it.

26:24.520 --> 26:28.525
No more cameras. No more propos.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.248
No more Games.

26:34.080 --> 26:36.890
He needs to see my eyes when I kill him.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.211
Now you're talking.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.100
Find a way to The Capitol

26:49.200 --> 26:51.282
when everybody's looking the other way.

26:51.680 --> 26:52.940
I hear the medics talking.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.689
They're shipping supplies for the front line
from hangar two around midnight tonight.

26:57.480 --> 26:58.740
Medicine, painkillers.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.740
I was gonna go steal some for myself,

27:00.840 --> 27:05.767
but I guess I could just
stay here and cover for you.

27:07.920 --> 27:11.049
Anybody can kill anybody, Katniss.
Even a president.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.491
You just have to be willing
to sacrifice yourself.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.043
Go on.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.483
Don't you want Snow to see you dance?

30:10.200 --> 30:11.804
Hey, that's her.

30:21.040 --> 30:22.565
That's Katniss Everdeen.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.460
Hey. Thought you were in the hospital.

30:51.560 --> 30:52.846
I was.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.325
Come on.

30:55.560 --> 30:56.846
What is she doing?

30:58.160 --> 31:00.580
I don't know, it's so frustrating
when she goes rogue.

31:00.680 --> 31:03.923
This isn't just adolescent,
it's insubordination.

31:04.880 --> 31:06.500
Put her on the first hovercraft back.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.887
Don't be ridiculous.
She can't come back now.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.485
She's mythic.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.445
At the front lines,
surviving a gunshot wound.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.402
Couldn't have staged it better myself.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.008
Hmm. I know.

31:23.400 --> 31:26.882
She's going to stay where she is.

31:29.440 --> 31:33.331
And whatever she's doing, we conceived it.

31:34.040 --> 31:35.690
It was our plan all along.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.084
Of course it was.

31:40.200 --> 31:44.046
Mr. Heavensbee, you're the Gamemaker.

31:45.120 --> 31:49.331
I want everyone to know, whatever game
she's playing, she's playing for us.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.900
I'm Commander Paylor of District 8.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.100
I'm a soldier, like all of you,
so here's what I know.

32:07.200 --> 32:11.845
For the first time in our lifetimes,
we're standing together with 13 districts.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.040
From what I see here,
we've already made history.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.802
But history doesn't stop to celebrate.

32:22.960 --> 32:26.580
And we're facing an enemy that will
not change and will never surrender.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.460
President Snow has
pulled back Peacekeepers

32:28.560 --> 32:31.020
to fortify the center of the city.

32:31.120 --> 32:33.780
He's evacuating residents
from the outer blocks.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.140
These civilians will be
confused and desperate.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.766
You are under orders not to target them.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.370
We're deploying medical brigades
to help anyone in need.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.848
We'll show The Capitol people who we are.

32:45.960 --> 32:49.980
To slow our advance, President Snow
is building a minefield of traps

32:50.080 --> 32:52.860
and lethal devices called "pods."

32:52.960 --> 32:57.260
The sadistic inventions of Gamemakers
meant to make sport of our deaths.

32:57.360 --> 33:00.460
If our armies make it past
Peacekeepers and other defenses,

33:00.560 --> 33:02.780
we'll converge in the center
of the city at Snow's mansion,

33:02.880 --> 33:04.580
where we won't just unlock his gates,

33:04.680 --> 33:06.762
but unshackle all of Panem.

33:11.600 --> 33:16.260
If we die, let it be for
a cause and not a spectacle.

33:16.360 --> 33:19.020
If we succeed, let it be for all of Panem,

33:19.120 --> 33:20.849
and let it be forever.

33:21.640 --> 33:24.007
Yes, you've already made history.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.881
But the future, our future,
starts tomorrow at dawn,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.446
when we march together into The Capitol.

33:49.440 --> 33:50.726
Squad 451?

33:57.840 --> 33:59.842
Looks like you got your meals covered.

34:00.280 --> 34:03.443
- Tryin' to be prepared.
- Don't lie to me.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.888
We've been hunting together all our lives.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.762
I know when you're gonna
go off on your own.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.219
You gonna leave me behind, too?

34:15.320 --> 34:20.808
As your fellow soldier, I suggest
that you stay with your unit.

34:22.600 --> 34:25.500
But I couldn't stop you
if you wanted to come.

34:25.600 --> 34:30.128
Hawthorne, Everdeen,
come meet your new unit.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.420
I'm Lieutenant Jackson,

34:38.520 --> 34:40.522
and I wanna introduce you to your squad.

34:41.199 --> 34:43.540
This is Second Lieutenant Mitchell,

34:43.639 --> 34:45.580
best sharpshooter in Panem.

34:45.679 --> 34:48.739
These are the Leeg sisters.
First Combat Division.

34:48.840 --> 34:51.206
And this is Corporal Homes.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.645
Finnick?

34:56.480 --> 34:58.500
- Are you with us?
- Looks like it.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.090
That was a short honeymoon.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.580
Yeah, well,

35:02.680 --> 35:05.460
I guess we're gonna have to
have one in The Capitol.

35:05.560 --> 35:07.369
- After we take it.
- Gather 'round.

35:13.120 --> 35:16.442
Squad 451, you're my unit.

35:17.160 --> 35:19.128
Lieutenant Jackson is
my second-in-command.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.700
Each one of you is elite
in some form of combat.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.020
But we are a non-combat unit.

35:25.120 --> 35:27.580
So we'll be following days
behind the front-line troops.

35:27.680 --> 35:30.860
You're to be the onscreen
faces of the invasion.

35:30.960 --> 35:33.140
"The Star Squad."

35:33.240 --> 35:35.242
It's been decided that
you're most effective

35:35.360 --> 35:37.300
- when seen by the masses.
- So we're not gonna fight?

35:37.400 --> 35:39.164
You'll do whatever
you're ordered to do, soldier.

35:39.280 --> 35:40.380
It's not your job to ask questions.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.209
Yes, sir.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.740
Our instructions are
to shoot propaganda footage

35:44.840 --> 35:47.380
on the battle-scarred streets
of The Capitol.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.847
You were handpicked
to intimidate their forces.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.740
And inspire surrenders.

35:51.840 --> 35:55.140
Even though we'll be working on abandoned
streets miles behind the front lines,

35:55.240 --> 35:56.820
I guarantee you, wherever they put us,

35:56.920 --> 36:00.049
it will not be safe. This is a war zone.

36:00.160 --> 36:04.529
It is likely that we'll encounter
both active pods and Peacekeepers.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.660
You're considered high-value
targets to The Capitol.

36:07.760 --> 36:11.220
In the event of capture,
you'll be given a nightlock pill.

36:11.320 --> 36:12.580
A poison that acts immediately.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.860
Lieutenant Jackson, do the honors.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.060
I've already briefed you on the pods.

36:17.160 --> 36:19.766
I remind you, they are on every block.

36:21.160 --> 36:22.889
Our unit has been given a Holo.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.086
A database that contains
a detailed map of The Capitol

36:28.200 --> 36:30.180
and a list of every known pod.

36:30.280 --> 36:33.020
These pods can trigger anything from bombs

36:33.120 --> 36:35.460
to traps to mutts.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.540
We cannot move without this device.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.860
There's no guarantee
that our database is complete.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.780
There could be new pods
that we're not aware of.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.300
Because we don't want
the Gamemakers to know

36:43.400 --> 36:46.340
we have this intel,
it has a self-destruct on it.

36:46.440 --> 36:48.780
You flip this switch,
say "nightlock" three times,

36:48.880 --> 36:51.580
and it blows itself and anything
within a 10-foot radius.

36:51.680 --> 36:54.620
Stay within our unit.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.180
Even with the Holo,

36:56.280 --> 36:59.204
it is likely that new pods have been set.

36:59.320 --> 37:02.324
Whatever they contain,
they are meant to kill you.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.940
Ladies and gentlemen,

37:06.040 --> 37:08.884
welcome to the 76th Hunger Games.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.500
I've never seen this place so empty.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.090
Just keep your eyes open.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.163
Got a pod. Let's take cover.

38:11.880 --> 38:13.325
Shoot through those two buildings.

38:16.560 --> 38:20.281
Pollux... right here.

38:20.600 --> 38:21.681
Castor.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.605
Good.

38:33.240 --> 38:34.526
When you're ready, Katniss.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.441
Hold it. Pollux, tighter.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.200
Okay.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.091
All clear.

39:20.640 --> 39:22.369
I don't think we can
get across this minefield.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.688
Not without that Holo.

39:25.800 --> 39:28.500
We're not gonna get it
off him while he's awake.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.967
Let's make sure we're on
the same watch tonight.

39:36.680 --> 39:37.920
Is that Peacekeepers?

39:43.880 --> 39:45.460
451 to base.

39:45.560 --> 39:47.767
We've got a truck coming in
from the south. Over.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.409
Copy that. Over.

39:51.960 --> 39:54.167
Stand down, everyone. It's friendly.

40:33.520 --> 40:34.700
My name is Peeta Mellark.

40:34.800 --> 40:35.961
My home is District 12.

40:38.160 --> 40:41.580
My name is Peeta Mellark.
My home is District 12.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.540
- Okay, stop.
- My name is Peeta Mellark.

40:43.640 --> 40:46.820
- Hold up. Everyone relax.
- My home is District 12.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.251
What are we doin'?

40:48.960 --> 40:50.530
Jackson, cuff him.

40:59.280 --> 41:00.740
Soldier, this is just a precaution

41:00.840 --> 41:02.842
till we can get everything
straightened out. Yeah?

41:04.560 --> 41:07.928
My name's Peeta Mellark. From District 12.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.540
They want us to add him to the propo.

41:12.640 --> 41:14.642
Show that he's on our side now.

41:15.880 --> 41:19.100
We'll move forward a few blocks tomorrow
and shoot the new footage.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.620
He's not in control of himself.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.540
I say we schedule an
around-the-clock watch on him.

41:23.640 --> 41:27.380
The Leegs till 1700,
Homes and Mitchell till 1900.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.084
Give me a watch.

41:30.800 --> 41:33.260
And if it really came down to it,
you think you could shoot him?

41:33.360 --> 41:35.169
I wouldn't be shooting Peeta.

41:35.680 --> 41:37.569
I'd be killing a Capitol mutt.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.100
I'm not sure that kind of a comment

41:39.200 --> 41:41.043
recommends you for the job,
either, soldier.

41:42.160 --> 41:43.286
Put her in the rotation.

42:06.120 --> 42:08.260
He's gonna try to kill me.

42:08.360 --> 42:09.700
Especially with all this going on.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.325
It's gonna set him off.

42:11.440 --> 42:12.930
We'll keep him contained.

42:13.840 --> 42:15.524
Why would Coin do this?

42:19.880 --> 42:20.961
Here's all I know.

42:23.280 --> 42:25.780
It was Peeta that she wanted
rescued from the arena.

42:25.880 --> 42:27.740
She never liked you.

42:27.840 --> 42:30.446
She doesn't like anybody
or anything she can't control.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.620
So she would put my life in danger?

42:32.720 --> 42:34.484
She'd deny it, but...

42:35.040 --> 42:36.540
What?

42:36.640 --> 42:38.688
One way or another, this war
is gonna come to an end.

42:39.800 --> 42:41.290
They promised a free election.

42:42.880 --> 42:44.928
Maybe she's startin' to
see you as a threat.

42:45.640 --> 42:48.460
Nobody would think I'd be a leader.

42:48.560 --> 42:50.220
But you'd throw your support to someone.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.924
Would it be her?

42:54.960 --> 42:58.444
And if your immediate answer
isn't "yes," then you're dangerous.

42:58.920 --> 43:01.260
She doesn't need you
as a rallying cry anymore.

43:01.360 --> 43:03.180
These propos can be done without you.

43:03.280 --> 43:06.370
There's only one thing you could do now
to add more fire to this rebellion.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.900
Die.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.446
That's not gonna happen
under my watch, Katniss.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.170
I'm plannin' for you to have a long life.

43:16.320 --> 43:18.049
Why? You don't owe me anything.

43:19.760 --> 43:21.330
Because you've earned it.

43:33.520 --> 43:35.124
We've been here before, you know.

43:36.600 --> 43:37.965
What?

43:39.120 --> 43:40.121
That look.

43:41.600 --> 43:42.886
I've seen that look.

43:46.360 --> 43:49.690
You're trying to decide
whether or not you should kill me.

43:50.240 --> 43:51.924
I never wanted to kill you.

43:54.440 --> 43:55.980
And that's not what I'm doing.

43:56.080 --> 44:00.260
I saw it with my own eyes.
In the first Games.

44:00.360 --> 44:03.364
In the first Games, I thought you were
trying to help the Careers kill me.

44:05.720 --> 44:10.044
After that,
I always saw you... as an ally.

44:12.960 --> 44:15.850
Friend, lover...

44:16.840 --> 44:17.966
Victor...

44:19.240 --> 44:20.890
fiancé,

44:21.120 --> 44:24.740
enemy, target, mutt.

44:24.840 --> 44:26.700
And now ally?

44:26.800 --> 44:30.289
Yeah, I'll add that to the list of words
I use to try to figure you out.

44:35.160 --> 44:36.400
I'm sorry.

44:38.880 --> 44:44.046
I just can't tell what's real
and what's made up anymore.

44:44.160 --> 44:47.323
Then ask. It's what Annie does.

44:47.680 --> 44:48.820
Ask who?

44:48.920 --> 44:52.049
Us. We're your unit now.

45:02.480 --> 45:04.403
Your favorite color is green.

45:05.840 --> 45:07.251
Is that real?

45:09.720 --> 45:12.371
Yeah. That's real.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.410
Yours is orange.

45:17.400 --> 45:20.563
Not bright orange.

45:21.800 --> 45:24.041
Soft, like the sunset.

45:25.440 --> 45:26.487
Thank you.

45:31.960 --> 45:34.122
You're a painter.

45:35.440 --> 45:37.363
You're a baker.

45:39.880 --> 45:42.121
You always sleep with the windows open.

45:45.520 --> 45:47.284
You never take sugar in your tea.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.363
You always double-knot your shoelaces.

45:54.680 --> 45:56.045
You were right.

45:58.640 --> 46:00.369
I can't do this.

46:10.600 --> 46:12.409
Guess we're not leavin' anymore.

46:14.920 --> 46:17.082
We're not going anywhere
without that Holo.

46:18.240 --> 46:19.480
Listen up.

46:21.440 --> 46:22.646
Mag's empty.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.850
It's only for the propo.

46:32.800 --> 46:35.531
Let's move.
We're headed five blocks north.

46:49.440 --> 46:52.620
"To the citizens of The Capitol,
our war is not with you."

46:52.720 --> 46:56.980
To the citizens of The Capitol,
our war is not with you.

46:57.080 --> 47:00.340
"You will be a vital part of the democracy
that follows our victory."

47:00.440 --> 47:04.260
Be a vital part of the democracy
that follows our victory.

47:04.360 --> 47:06.442
- You got it.
- Okay.

47:24.480 --> 47:28.530
Boggs. This is a good spot.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.300
Through there, in the courtyard.

47:31.400 --> 47:32.890
Okay, let us clear it.

47:52.520 --> 47:53.760
Got a pod.

47:55.080 --> 47:56.320
Split. Take cover.

48:09.160 --> 48:10.889
Stay back.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.060
All clear. Gale, Homes, with me.

48:39.160 --> 48:40.924
Leegs, take the wings.

49:06.240 --> 49:07.580
Everdeen, no!

49:07.680 --> 49:08.727
Boggs!

49:08.840 --> 49:11.180
- Hold your position!
- Boggs!

49:11.280 --> 49:12.850
Grab the tourniquets from the bag.

49:13.840 --> 49:15.660
Squeeze his legs as hard as you can.

49:15.760 --> 49:16.780
It's okay.

49:16.880 --> 49:18.882
The Holo. The Holo.

49:21.440 --> 49:23.620
Unfit for command.

49:23.720 --> 49:25.620
Transfer primary security clearance...

49:25.720 --> 49:27.020
Say your name.

49:27.120 --> 49:29.009
Katniss Everdeen.

49:30.120 --> 49:31.201
What did you just do?

49:31.320 --> 49:34.620
Katniss, don't trust them.

49:34.720 --> 49:36.688
Kill Peeta, if you have to.

49:37.200 --> 49:41.250
- Do what you came to do.
- Boggs? Boggs?

49:54.520 --> 49:58.161
- Come on. Come on.
- He's gone. He's gone.

50:28.720 --> 50:30.927
Go, go, go!

50:32.680 --> 50:34.603
- This way!
- Keep moving.

50:34.880 --> 50:37.020
Let's go, soldiers!

50:37.120 --> 50:39.851
- Get to higher ground!
- Move!

50:46.200 --> 50:47.645
Finnick!

50:50.280 --> 50:52.248
- Peeta!
- Mitchell!

50:53.800 --> 50:55.260
Come on, come on!

50:55.360 --> 50:56.930
Settle!

50:57.040 --> 50:59.340
Come on! Don't stop! Let's go!

50:59.440 --> 51:01.180
Come on, come on! We gotta move!

51:01.280 --> 51:02.611
Get inside!

51:04.120 --> 51:08.180
Everybody, inside!
Go! Upstairs! Go! Hurry up!

51:08.280 --> 51:09.281
Move!

51:12.440 --> 51:14.363
- Go! Go!
- Move!

51:19.240 --> 51:20.321
Keep moving!

51:21.880 --> 51:23.882
Keep moving to the top!

51:24.080 --> 51:25.286
Go!

51:35.320 --> 51:37.561
Hey, hey! I got you.

51:46.440 --> 51:48.044
It's slowing down.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.168
Gamemakers are still
putting on quite a show.

52:06.400 --> 52:10.100
- 451 to base. Over.
- Hey, we better move.

52:10.200 --> 52:12.680
If Peacekeepers didn't know
where we were, they do now.

52:13.040 --> 52:15.100
Those surveillance cameras caught us.

52:15.200 --> 52:17.700
451 to base. Come in.

52:17.800 --> 52:20.531
This is a bad spot. We need to move now.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.161
451 to base. Over.

52:24.520 --> 52:26.727
I can't get a signal.

52:27.480 --> 52:29.847
But I can get us back to base.
Everdeen, give me the Holo.

52:32.800 --> 52:34.643
Everdeen, what did I just say?
The Holo. Come on, let's go.

52:35.360 --> 52:37.169
Boggs gave it to me.

52:38.160 --> 52:39.420
What are you talking about?

52:39.520 --> 52:42.180
He did. He transferred
security clearance to her.

52:42.280 --> 52:43.441
I saw him.

52:45.840 --> 52:47.365
And why would he do that?

52:48.440 --> 52:50.740
I'm on special orders from Coin.

52:50.840 --> 52:52.620
To do what?

52:52.720 --> 52:54.563
To assassinate President Snow.

52:58.480 --> 53:01.290
I don't believe that for one second.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.540
As your new unit commander,

53:03.640 --> 53:06.564
I order you to transfer security
clearance to me now.

53:06.920 --> 53:08.729
I can't do that.

53:13.080 --> 53:14.730
Let's not lose our heads here.

53:19.480 --> 53:21.100
I'm not asking you again, Everdeen.

53:21.200 --> 53:22.929
Give me that Holo.

53:25.200 --> 53:29.046
She's telling the truth.
Plutarch wants it televised.

53:29.480 --> 53:32.580
He thinks if we could film
the Mockingjay assassinating Snow,

53:32.680 --> 53:36.288
it'll make The Capitol surrender
before the casualties get too high.

53:36.400 --> 53:39.250
While we're arguing, there's 100
Peacekeepers on their way here.

53:43.520 --> 53:46.765
Boggs promised me that when
the time came, you would help me.

54:03.600 --> 54:06.809
All right, soldier, Holo's yours.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.580
I don't think we're gonna
leave any footprints.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.700
We should move now.
And those cameras outside

54:22.800 --> 54:23.820
should be covered up by the oil.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.300
She can't move forward like this.

54:25.400 --> 54:28.961
Her leg is too bad.
We have to evacuate her.

54:30.320 --> 54:32.380
I'm sorry.

54:32.480 --> 54:34.482
I'll stay with her.

54:34.680 --> 54:36.540
As soon as we make contact,

54:36.640 --> 54:39.007
we will send somebody back. I promise you.

54:42.080 --> 54:43.380
All right, everybody, move out.

54:43.480 --> 54:45.050
- Let's get him up.
- Let's go!

54:46.800 --> 54:48.211
Can you walk?

55:32.520 --> 55:33.760
Come on, this way.

55:53.360 --> 55:55.089
Get these curtains closed.

56:22.280 --> 56:23.441
It's the Leegs.

56:48.800 --> 56:51.610
Good afternoon. I'm Caesar Flickerman.

56:51.720 --> 56:56.180
Here with our continuing coverage
of the defense of The Capitol.

56:56.280 --> 57:01.020
Today, as our Peacekeepers
valiantly hold off the rebels,

57:01.120 --> 57:04.900
our story takes a surprising twist.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.820
Katniss Everdeen,
our once favorite daughter,

57:07.920 --> 57:11.620
has infiltrated the city
with some of the Victors,

57:11.720 --> 57:13.940
whose names are all too familiar.

57:14.040 --> 57:17.487
Finnick Odair and Peeta Mellark.

57:19.880 --> 57:23.202
Clearly, some alliances
don't last forever.

57:25.680 --> 57:27.900
Take a look at what happened
just a moment ago,

57:28.000 --> 57:31.020
when our Peacekeepers cornered
Katniss Everdeen

57:31.120 --> 57:33.700
and her band of foolish rebels.

57:33.800 --> 57:35.380
Whatever arrogance

57:35.480 --> 57:38.660
brought this treacherous girl back to us,

57:38.760 --> 57:40.900
you are about to witness a great victory,

57:41.000 --> 57:43.731
not only for The Capitol, but for Panem.

58:03.320 --> 58:06.020
So there you have it.

58:06.120 --> 58:09.180
Katniss Everdeen, the Girl on Fire,

58:09.280 --> 58:12.060
a girl who inspired so much violence,

58:12.160 --> 58:15.926
seems to have met a violent end herself.

58:16.480 --> 58:20.166
Stay tuned for more information.
Caesar Flickerman. Thank you.

58:21.280 --> 58:23.140
So now that we're dead,
what are we gonna do?

58:23.240 --> 58:24.844
Isn't it obvious?

58:25.920 --> 58:27.843
The next move is to kill me.

58:33.320 --> 58:35.527
I murdered one of our squad members.

58:38.560 --> 58:39.891
Katniss is right.

58:42.320 --> 58:44.288
I'm a mutt.

58:44.800 --> 58:48.088
And it's only a matter of time
before I snap again.

58:50.240 --> 58:52.049
I'm not in control.

58:53.640 --> 58:57.180
I need a nightlock pill,
so I can die when I need to.

58:57.280 --> 58:59.647
If it gets to that point,
I'll kill you myself.

59:17.960 --> 59:21.568
I don't think I ever really understood
The Capitol until now.

59:21.920 --> 59:23.843
You eat like this,
you'll believe anything.

59:55.640 --> 01:00:00.020
So Katniss Everdeen, a poor unstable girl

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.380
with nothing but a small talent

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:05.201
with a bow and arrow, is dead.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.700
Not a thinker, not a leader.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.060
Simply a face plucked from the masses.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.860
Was she valuable?

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.220
She was extremely valuable
to your rebellion

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:22.042
because you have no vision,
no true leader among you.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.220
You call yourselves an alliance.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.820
But we saw what that means.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.163
Your soldiers are at each other's throats.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.980
Good evening. For those of you
who don't know me,

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.980
please, allow me to introduce myself.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:46.580
I am President Alma Coin,
leader of the rebellion.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.260
I have interrupted a broadcast
from your President

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.300
in which he attempted to
defame a brave young woman.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.380
"A face picked from
the masses," he called her.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.460
Plucked.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:04.220
As if a leader, a true leader,
could be anything else.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.900
I had the privilege of knowing

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.700
a small-town girl
from the Seam in District 12

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.700
who survived the Hunger Games
and the Quarter Quell

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.140
and rose up and turned

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.562
a nation of slaves into an army!

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.300
Dead or alive, Katniss Everdeen

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.482
will remain the face of this revolution.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.380
She will not have died for nothing.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.700
I had no idea I meant so much to her.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.140
Her vision and ours will be realized.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.460
A free Panem
with self-determination for all.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:42.900
And in her memory,
we will all find the strength

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.900
to rid Panem of its oppressors.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.322
Thank you. And be safe.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.441
Snow's in his mansion. Where is that?

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.045
That's us.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.900
That's the City Circle.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.322
It's at least 70, 75 blocks north.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.740
- Seventy-five blocks?
- Uh-huh.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.571
Nobody knows we're alive.
This is our chance.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.540
These buildings. Do these
look over Snow's gardens?

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.340
- I...
- They do.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.420
If he goes outside at all,
I could get a clear shot.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.602
We're getting ahead of ourselves here.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.860
Whether they're looking for us
or not, we are pinned down.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.769
Hit that button. Scan for pods.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.660
Just about every ten steps.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.100
Yeah, that doesn't even show the new ones.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.328
So we can't go anywhere in the streets.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.965
And the rooftops are just as bad.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.762
There might be another way.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.687
My brother knows
these tunnels really well.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.060
He worked sanitation down here.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.003
Right after they made him an Avox.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.360
Hey. Hey.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.888
You gonna be okay? Look at me. Look at me.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.807
We're gonna get through this. I promise.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.740
Took us five years to
buy his way outta here.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.808
He didn't see the sun once.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.286
We're too exposed here.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.890
Sir, should I call for your doctor?

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.930
- What did you say?
- Shall I call for your doctor?

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:01.420
I hope you've wakened me for something
more urgent than an old man's health.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:04.808
They survived. I don't know how.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.980
We picked them up on a surveillance cam.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:10.129
Let me see. I... I need to see for myself.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.731
It's her.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.206
It is her.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.131
The arena has moved underground.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:44.721
Looks clear.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.200
Everybody okay?

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.567
Yeah.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.682
All right, everybody, we're gonna stop here
for a bit and get some rest, yeah?

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.930
I'll take first watch.

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.806
Hey, Peeta. Just tuck in there.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.845
All right, settle in, everybody.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.970
Katniss. Your watch.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:58.486
You know, The Capitol,
they used tracker jacker venom on me.

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.844
That's what the doctors in 13 said.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.128
You were stung once, too.

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.250
Real or not real?

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:11.620
Real.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.620
When they used the venom on me,

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:17.326
they would show me pictures of my life.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:21.810
But some weren't real.

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.203
They changed them.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.220
At first, they all...
They all blurred together.

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:35.769
But now... Now I can
sort them out a little.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.420
Like the ones that they changed,

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.020
they have this quality...

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:45.125
It's like they're shiny.
They've been glossed over.

01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:49.850
You should get some rest.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.580
You're still trying to protect me.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.170
Real or not real?

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:58.970
Real.

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:01.965
That's what you and I do.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.443
Keep each other alive.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.729
Katniss. Katniss. Katniss.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.086
Katniss?

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.300
What is that?

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.940
We gotta go. We gotta get outta here now.

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.122
- Keep your voice down.
- Mutts! They released mutts.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.300
Pollux, what's the fastest way out?

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.050
Come on! Go! Go!

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.980
- Go! Go! Go! It's mutts!
- Come on, come on, come on!

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.605
Pollux, lead us out of here!

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:28.841
Come on!

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.486
Castor!

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.365
Fall back!

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.360
Move!

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.882
Katniss, come on! Move!

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:40.961
Katniss!

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.922
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.325
Go, go, go!

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.084
Katniss!

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.251
- No!
- Finnick!

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:04.970
Finnick!

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:10.140
Katniss!

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.802
Nightlock. Nightlock. Nightlock.

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.860
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Let's go.

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.007
Keep moving! Keep moving!

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.247
Ow!

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.980
Go! Go!

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.650
Keep going! Keep going!

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.727
Peeta, come on!

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.121
Peeta!

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:18.020
Peeta, we have to keep going!

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.940
I'm a mutt! I can't keep control!

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.500
- Yes, you can!
- Leave me! I'm a mutt!

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.443
Look at me! Look at me.

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.926
Stay with me.

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.620
Always.

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.801
Come on.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.100
I know where we are!

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.123
I know a place. Up those stairs.

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:47.846
Keep going.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:10.561
Someone's coming.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.965
Shut the door, shut the door!

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.964
No, Katniss, it's okay, it's okay.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:20.686
It's okay.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.820
Tigris, do you remember me?

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:27.660
I'm with Plutarch's underground.

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.180
We need your help.

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:30.281
Clear!

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.167
I know you.
You were a stylist in the Games.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.009
Until Snow decided I wasn't
pretty enough anymore.

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.011
I'm here to kill him.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.171
Gale's gonna need stitches.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.805
I made it up.

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.766
All of it.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.500
There is no special mission from Coin.

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.125
There's only my plan.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.447
Everyone that's dead is dead
because of me. I lied.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:31.660
We know. We all knew.

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.940
- The soldiers from 13?
- They did, too.

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.960
Do you really believe that Jackson
thought you had orders from Coin?

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:43.170
She trusted Boggs and he clearly
wanted you to go on.

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:48.125
I never meant for this to happen.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.050
I failed. I...

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:58.848
I killed them. I killed Finnick.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.809
I'm sorry, Pollux.

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.285
I'm so sorry.

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:10.729
Glimmer, Marvel, Mags...

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:18.483
Clove, Wiress, Rue.

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:23.009
What do all those deaths mean?

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.644
They mean that our lives were never ours.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.284
There was no real life because
we didn't have any choice.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.689
Our lives belong to Snow
and our deaths do, too.

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.449
But if you kill him, Katniss...

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.604
If you end all of this,

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:55.521
all those deaths, they mean something.

01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:01.529
Cinna, Boggs, Castor,

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.768
Jackson, Finnick.

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:09.566
They chose this.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:14.681
They chose you.

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.940
You should keep these clean.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.565
Otherwise they'll get infected.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:28.366
You should cuff me.

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.404
It's not safe with me yet.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.206
I have moments when I'm here.

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:38.566
And my memories are getting better, but...

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.249
other times it's like I'm sleepwalking.

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.246
You should cuff me.

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:13.660
Thanks.

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:14.921
No problem.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.524
I can't sleep.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.610
Yeah, I haven't slept in days, either.

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:36.290
I should've volunteered to take
your place in the first Games.

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.091
No, you couldn't have.

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.140
No, she never would have forgiven you.

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:46.245
She needed you to be there
and take care of her family and you did.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.121
She can't lose you.

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:52.721
She really loves you.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.642
And the way she kissed you
in the Quarter Quell.

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.300
She never kissed me like that.

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.620
Oh, just part of the show.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.803
No. No, you won her over.

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:09.724
You gave up everything for her.

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:17.487
Well, it's not gonna be
an issue much longer.

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.100
I doubt all three of us
are gonna make it out of this.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.929
And if we do, then...

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.323
it's her problem who to choose, right?

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.380
Yeah.

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.650
I do know that Katniss will pick
whoever she can't survive without.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.844
Mortar shells. It's not ours.

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:43.211
Peacekeepers must be shellin'
the rebels outside the city.

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:45.763
That's not outside the city.

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.845
Sun's comin' up.

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.140
There's some small-arms fire.
Could be Paylor, maybe Lyme.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.820
Rebels are close.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.160
This is it.

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.860
To all Capitol citizens

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.140
more than a half mile
outside the City Circle,

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:19.820
I am announcing a mandatory evacuation.

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.940
Come to the mansion.

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.700
I am promising you shelter and sanctuary.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:29.220
All refugees, come to my home.

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.860
There you will be provided with food,

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:36.020
medicine, safety for your children,

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:37.804
and you will have my solemn oath

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:41.140
to protect you until my dying breath.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.940
Wish he'd hurry up with that last part.

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:47.420
Our enemy is not like us.
They do not share our values.

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:51.620
They have never known our comfort
and our sophistication.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:55.180
And they despise us for it.
Make no mistake.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:58.204
They are not coming to liberate us.

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.569
They are coming
to destroy our way of life.

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.921
They are coming to bury us.

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.523
Is he still in the mansion?

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.126
Peeta?

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:14.891
Yeah. I recognize the room.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.321
Where is that?

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.445
About five blocks away.

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.940
We're right here. Off the Avenues.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.380
Mansion's here.

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:28.060
What about the pods?

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:32.260
They'll probably deactivate the pods
around here for the residents' safety.

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:36.220
That could work. I could get close enough.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.260
Every Peacekeeper's gonna be waiting.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.089
Next to our faces on every billboard.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.922
Snow's offering shelter
to all the refugees.

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.980
Head straight north.

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.220
There's gonna be thousands of refugees.

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:55.288
Just get into that stream
and don't look up.

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.049
We got one shot.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.286
Let's make it count.

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.325
Good luck, Katniss.

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.446
Thank you.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.047
Pollux.

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.460
Tigris, thank you
for everything you've done.

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:30.780
Katniss, let me come with you, okay?

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.820
I can be a good distraction.
They know my face.

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:35.220
- No, I'm not losing you again.
- You'll be safer with us.

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.620
What if Peacekeepers
are searching the houses?

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.420
And if he's captured...

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:41.126
Then give me a nightlock pill, okay?
I'm not goin' back.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.165
Stay alive.

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:22.361
If I see you again,
it's gonna be a different world.

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.770
Ready, Katniss?

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.281
Let's go.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:54.180
By order of President Snow,

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:57.700
all residents must proceed
to the Presidential Estate.

01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:59.860
Please, continue to move forward

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:03.420
in a calm and orderly fashion.

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:06.580
Additional food, medicine and clothing

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:08.967
will be provided upon arrival.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.540
By order of President Snow,

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:16.740
all residents must proceed
to the Presidential Estate.

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.900
Please, continue to move forward

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.100
in a calm and orderly fashion.

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:25.580
Additional food, medicine and clothing

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.160
will be provided upon arrival.

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.161
By order of President Snow,

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.500
all residents must proceed
to the Presidential Estate.

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:38.260
Please, continue to move forward

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.727
in a calm and orderly fashion.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.740
Additional food, medicine and clothing

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.446
will be provided upon arrival.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:51.020
By order of President Snow,

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:54.580
all residents must proceed
to the Presidential Estate.

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:56.860
Please, continue to move forward

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.100
in a calm and orderly fashion.

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:03.540
Additional food, medicine and clothing

01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.961
will be provided upon arrival.

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.328
By order of President Snow...

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:10.980
Keep moving.

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:13.540
...all residents must proceed
to the Presidential Estate.

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.540
Please, continue to move forward

01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:18.900
in a calm and orderly fashion.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.300
Additional food, medicine and clothing

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.846
will be provided upon arrival.

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:23.300
It's the rebels!

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:25.020
The rebels are attacking!

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.407
- Rebels!
- Rebels!

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.889
Run! Run!

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:41.887
Mama! Mama!

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:43.406
Come on!

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.651
Come on, come on!

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.445
Shoot me!

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:43.961
Shoot me!

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.740
Stay calm.

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.968
Bring your children forward.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.446
The gates will open momentarily.

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:42.680
The children will be received first.

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:46.940
Stay calm.

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.281
Bring your children forward.

01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:53.180
The gates will open momentarily.

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.620
The children will be received first.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:57.980
Mom!

01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.580
Stay calm.

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.205
Bring your children forward.

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.860
The gates will open momentarily.

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:08.361
The children will be received first.

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:20.561
It's The Capitol!

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.731
Gifts from The Capitol!

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.001
Gifts!

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.566
Medic!

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.605
Medic!

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:29.860
- Medic!
- Make a hole!

01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.564
Medics coming in!

01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:33.284
Bring a stretcher!

01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:35.080
This way, this way!

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:38.800
Prim?

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.681
Primrose!

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:43.845
Prim!

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:26.003
Hey. I need you to lie back.

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.082
You're okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:37.620
Fight was over after The Capitol

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.848
dropped those bombs to defend the palace.

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.365
The rebels walked right in.

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:49.210
Don't, Katniss. The ointment's working.

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.086
Everybody felt it.

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:58.568
Peacekeepers, palace guards.
They had kids in there, too.

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.041
It was...

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.210
It was over after that.

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:19.960
Mom?

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.567
I remember the first time
I brought you here.

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.206
And here we are.

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.963
I brought all your things.

01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.928
Well, I'll leave you to get settled.

01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:24.460
Sorry, ma'am. Can't let you pass.

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.340
Let her in.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.540
On my authority.

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.449
She has a right to anything
behind that door.

01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:59.644
That's a nice one.

01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:02.882
The colors are lovely, of course.

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:06.122
But nothing says perfection like white.

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.202
I was hoping you'd find your way here.

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:14.321
There are so many things
we should discuss.

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:21.700
But I have a feeling
your visit will be brief,

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:24.371
so first things first.

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:37.126
I wanted to tell you how very sorry
I am about your sister.

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:42.780
So wasteful. So unnecessary.

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:46.009
Anyone could see the game
was over by that point.

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.100
In fact, I was just about to
issue an official surrender

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:51.060
when they released those parachutes.

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:53.580
You released those parachutes.

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:56.100
You really think I gave the order?

01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.248
We both know I'm not
above killing children.

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.247
But I'm not wasteful.

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:05.100
I take life for specific reasons.

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:09.220
And there was no reason for me to destroy
a pen full of Capitol children.

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.890
None at all.

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:21.204
I must concede, it was
a masterful move on Coin's part.

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.740
The idea that I was bombing

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:28.049
our own helpless children
to hold back the rebels...

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.970
It turned the last of
my guards against me.

01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:36.200
There was no resistance left
inside The Capitol or the mansion.

01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:40.004
Do you know it aired live?

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:45.809
There's a particular savvy
in that, isn't there?

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:53.566
I'm sure she wasn't
gunning for your sister, but...

01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:56.969
these things happen in war.

01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:03.882
My failure was in being so
slow to grasp Coin's plan.

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:08.900
She let The Capitol and the Districts
destroy one another,

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.800
then she stepped in to
take power with 13's arsenal.

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:17.180
Oh, make no mistake,

01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.248
she intends to take my place now.

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:24.045
But I've been watching you.

01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:27.529
And you watching me.

01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:31.646
I'm afraid we've both
been played for fools.

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:36.801
I don't believe you.

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:41.380
Oh, my dear Miss Everdeen.

01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:45.565
I thought we'd agreed
never to lie to each other.

01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:05.011
President Coin asked for you.

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:07.924
You never came to see me.

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:13.340
I wanted to, but...

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:14.646
Was it ours?

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:17.126
The bomb.

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:20.649
The delayed explosion.

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:23.720
The trap.

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:27.730
To draw more people in.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.047
Was that you?

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.040
I don't know.

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:39.089
All I know is...

01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:42.321
that I was supposed to
take care of your family.

01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.204
Now I'm sorry I couldn't.

01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.207
You can't protect anyone in an arena.

01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:14.486
Goodbye, Gale.

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:33.380
What's this?

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:35.801
The remaining Victors. Won't you join us?

01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:50.740
I have invited you all here
for several reasons,

01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:53.020
but first, I have an announcement.

01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:56.300
I have taken the burden and the honor

01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.722
of declaring myself
Interim President of Panem.

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:06.620
Interim? Exactly how long is that interim?

01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:09.420
We have no way of knowing for certain.

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:12.500
But it's clear that people
are far too emotional right now

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:14.860
to make a rational decision.

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:17.420
We'll plan an election
when the time is right.

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:22.620
But I have called you here
for a far more important vote.

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:24.980
A symbolic vote.

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:28.402
This afternoon, we will execute Snow.

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:32.660
Hundreds of his accomplices
also await their deaths.

01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:37.740
Capitol officials, Peacekeepers,
torturers, Gamemakers.

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:39.860
But the danger is, once we begin,

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:43.100
the rebels will not stop
calling for retribution.

01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:46.488
Thirst for blood is
a difficult urge to satisfy.

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:52.003
So I offer an alternative plan.

01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:55.411
Majority of four may approve it.
No one may abstain.

01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:59.008
The proposal is this:

01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:03.922
In lieu of these barbaric executions,

01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:08.128
we hold a symbolic Hunger Games.

01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:23.206
You wanna have another Hunger Games
with The Capitol's children?

01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:27.442
- You're joking?
- Not in the slightest.

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:30.286
Is this Plutarch's idea?

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.120
It was mine.

01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:36.740
It balances the need for revenge

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:39.446
with the least loss of human life.

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:42.803
- You may cast your votes.
- No.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.980
No, obviously not. This is crazy.

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:48.460
I think it's more than fair.
Snow's got a granddaughter.

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:49.860
I say "yes."

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:52.540
So do I. Let them have a taste of it.

01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.740
You guys, this way of thinking
is what started these uprisings.

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:59.380
I vote "no." With Peeta.

01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:00.780
So would Finnick, if he were here.

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:02.140
Well, he's not.

01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:04.368
- Because Snow killed him.
- No.

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:09.211
We need to stop viewing
each other as enemies.

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.649
It's down to Katniss and Haymitch.

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.088
I get to kill Snow.

01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:24.202
I expected no less of you.

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.884
Then I vote "yes."

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.171
For Prim.

01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:39.446
Haymitch?

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:52.962
I'm with the Mockingjay.

01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:55.851
That carries the vote.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.540
Excellent.

01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:01.689
We'll announce the Games tonight,
after the execution.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.847
Well, it's bound to be quite the show.

01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:15.407
Oh, you look lovely as ever.

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:18.201
Just beautiful.

01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:22.564
Finishing touches.

01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:49.364
Welcome to the new Panem.

01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:54.721
Today, on the Avenue of the Tributes,

01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:59.460
all of Panem, a free Panem,

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:02.484
will watch more than a mere spectacle.

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:07.140
We are gathered to witness

01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:10.700
an historic moment of justice.

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:15.220
Today, the greatest friend
to the revolution

01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:19.245
will fire the shot to end all wars.

01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:24.885
May her arrow signify the end of tyranny

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:29.805
and the beginning of a new era.

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:33.283
Mockingjay,

01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:38.260
may your aim be as true

01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:42.922
as your heart is pure.

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:32.241
No!

01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:34.260
No!

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.522
Kill him!

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.843
Kill him! Kill him now!

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:47.126
Kill him!

01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:01.163
I'll say this for you, Katniss.

01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:04.005
You don't disappoint.

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:10.020
Well, Plutarch gave me a letter for you.

01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:11.121
I don't want it.

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:13.682
You never make it easy, do you?

01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:18.563
Okay. I'll read it for you.

01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:24.300
"Katniss, maybe the country was
shocked tonight by your arrow,

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:26.180
but once again, I was not.

01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:30.020
You were exactly who I believed you were.

01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:32.020
I wish I could give you a proper goodbye.

01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:33.780
But with both Coin and Snow dead,

01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:35.980
the fate of the country
will be decided tonight,

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:38.003
and I can't be seen at your side.

01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:43.180
Tonight, the 12 District leaders
will call for a free election.

01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:45.260
There's little doubt
that Paylor will carry it.

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.140
She's become the voice of reason.

01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:51.020
I'm sorry so much burden fell on you.

01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:53.646
I know you'll never escape it.

01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:58.691
But if I had to put you through it
again for this outcome, I would.

01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:04.180
The war's over.
We'll enter that sweet period

01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:08.046
where everyone agrees not to
repeat the recent horrors.

01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:12.300
Of course, we're fickle, stupid
beings, with poor memories

01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:15.165
and a great gift for self.destruction.

01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:19.729
Although, who knows?
Maybe this time, we'll learn.

01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:24.180
I've secured you a ride
out of The Capitol.

01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:26.100
It's better for you to be out of sight.

01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:29.568
And when the time is right,
Commander Paylor will pardon you.

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.620
The country will find its peace.

01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:35.041
I hope you can find yours.

01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:36.930
Plutarch."

01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:40.967
What now?

01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:45.140
Home.

01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:47.447
We go home.

01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:54.761
I couldn't let you go
without a proper goodbye.

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:03.566
It's your job to take care
of yourself now, Katniss.

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:08.964
Promise me you'll find it.

01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:11.726
Find what?

01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:15.562
The life of a Victor.

01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:19.887
- Goodbye, Effie.
- Goodbye, my girl.

01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:26.443
Effie, don't be a stranger.

01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:33.840
- Take care of her.
- I will.

01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:06.720
She's gone.

01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:16.205
Get out!

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:21.860
Get out! Prim is gone!

01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:23.962
Prim is gone!

01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:26.620
She's dead! And she's not coming back!

01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:29.564
Get out! Get out!

02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:04.246
Peeta?

02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:09.606
Hey.

02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:12.924
You came home.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.206
Yeah.

02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:24.529
I found these, uh,
out by the edge of the forest.

02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:29.801
It's a primrose.

02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:44.760
So sorry, Katniss.

02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:55.740
"You'll be happy to hear
that Katniss' mother

02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:58.260
has been training new medical
units in The Capitol.

02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:00.860
Gale has been promoted
to a captain in District 2

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:03.281
to help keep order and security.

02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:05.580
And I am loving every moment with my son

02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:08.300
who reminds me every day of his father.

02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:10.129
We've all suffered so much,

02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:13.180
but we owe it to their memories
and to our children

02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:15.780
to do our best with these lives.

02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:18.884
I hope you're both finding some peace.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.365
Annie."

02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:31.340
I solemnly swear

02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:35.580
to the best of my ability,
to preserve, protect,

02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:39.162
and uphold the rights
of every citizen of Panem.

02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:41.726
There's Plutarch,
right in the middle of it all.

02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:45.041
And they say no one ever wins the Games.

02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:06.125
You love me.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.684
Real or not real?

02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:13.406
Real.

02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:11.089
Did you have a nightmare?

02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:14.490
I have nightmares, too.

02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:23.567
Someday I'll explain it to you.

02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:29.768
Why they came,
why they won't ever go away.

02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:39.642
But I'll tell you how I survive it.

02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:44.100
I make a list in my head

02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:46.931
of all the good things
I've seen someone do.

02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:51.205
Every little thing I can remember.

02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:56.420
It's like a game.

02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:58.966
I do it over and over.

02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:04.529
Gets a little tedious
after all these years, but...

02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.880
there are much worse games to play.
