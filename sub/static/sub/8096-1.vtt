00:24.750 --> 00:27.218
I always wanted to be
in the movies

00:28.454 --> 00:34.415
When I was little I thought for sure
one day, I could be a big big star...

00:34.593 --> 00:36.686
Or maybe just beautiful...

00:36.895 --> 00:40.262
Beautiful and rich,
like the women on TV

00:41.033 --> 00:43.558
Yeah, I had a lot of dreams

00:43.702 --> 00:46.193
And I guess you can
call me a real romantic

00:46.338 --> 00:50.035
Because I truly believe that
one day...they'll come true

00:50.409 --> 00:52.934
So I dream about it for hours

00:53.112 --> 00:56.782
As the years went by,
I learnt to stop sharing this with people

00:56.782 --> 00:58.374
They said I was dreaming

00:58.484 --> 01:02.215
But back then, I believed
it whole heartily

01:02.488 --> 01:06.015
So whenever I was down,
I would just escape into my mind

01:06.358 --> 01:09.384
To my other live, where
I was someone else

01:09.561 --> 01:11.756
It made me happy to think
that all these people...

01:11.897 --> 01:14.297
just didn't know yet
who I was gonna be

01:14.500 --> 01:17.230
But 1 day they'll all see

01:17.469 --> 01:20.370
I heard that Marilyn Monroe
was discovered in a soda shop

01:20.406 --> 01:22.601
And I thought for sure,
it could be like that

01:22.775 --> 01:24.640
So I started growing up
real young...

01:24.843 --> 01:28.904
And I always secretIy looking
for who is gonna discover me?

01:29.047 --> 01:30.878
Was it this guy?

01:33.385 --> 01:34.909
Or maybe this one?

01:35.587 --> 01:37.054
You never knew

01:37.923 --> 01:41.381
But even if they couldn't take me
all the way ... like Marilyn

01:41.493 --> 01:44.223
They would somehow
believe in me just enough

01:44.329 --> 01:49.460
They would see me for what I could
be, and think I was beautiful

01:51.537 --> 01:53.732
Like a diamond in the rough

01:54.807 --> 01:56.798
They'll take me away...

01:56.909 --> 01:58.467
To my new life

01:58.677 --> 02:00.736
And my new world

02:00.879 --> 02:03.006
Where everything
would be different

02:06.552 --> 02:11.888
Yeah, I lived that way
for long long time

02:12.124 --> 02:15.890
And my head dreaming
like that

02:15.961 --> 02:17.553
It was nice

02:17.729 --> 02:19.594
1 day it just stopped

02:38.550 --> 02:40.609
By the time I met
you all...

02:41.019 --> 02:44.455
Shame...
all I want is a beer

03:00.472 --> 03:02.463
How are you doing?
-Great

03:02.508 --> 03:03.634
Anyone sitting here?

03:03.742 --> 03:05.209
No

03:27.432 --> 03:30.401
Madam our services
are for patrons onIy

03:34.239 --> 03:36.503
Give me a beer
whatever cheapest

03:38.544 --> 03:41.411
So what it is like,
a gay place or what?

03:41.680 --> 03:43.409
Yeah

03:45.017 --> 03:46.609
Hey, whatever, man

04:09.808 --> 04:11.742
Can I buy you that drink?

04:11.877 --> 04:13.640
I got my own money

04:16.615 --> 04:20.016
I'll have a pitcher, whatever
she's having

04:22.087 --> 04:23.987
Look, I'm not gay alright?

04:25.791 --> 04:27.554
Well, it makes sense

04:27.593 --> 04:28.958
So what are you doing
here then?

04:29.127 --> 04:31.027
My truck broke down, I'm a ...

04:32.564 --> 04:34.657
I got a pressure cleaning
business

04:34.766 --> 04:36.165
What's pressure cleaning?

04:36.335 --> 04:38.132
You know steam clean?

04:38.570 --> 04:40.037
Upholstery, carpets,
you know, shit like that

04:41.573 --> 04:44.064
So I'm just getting out of the rain

04:44.810 --> 04:46.835

04:53.585 --> 04:54.984
You owe me change!

04:57.322 --> 05:01.656

05:05.330 --> 05:06.922

Stop wasting your fucking
time!

05:09.701 --> 05:11.498
I wasn't trying to fuck
you!

05:11.670 --> 05:12.898
I just wanna talk to you

05:13.038 --> 05:16.599
I thought that if I bought you
some beer maybe you'll talk to me

05:17.342 --> 05:19.902
I just trying to have one
decent night out, you know ..

05:20.879 --> 05:24.940
Just talk to someone before
I've to go back to my parents closet

05:25.283 --> 05:27.046
I'm sorry

05:36.928 --> 05:38.156
You don't have to stay

05:43.769 --> 05:46.169
So are you really a
steam cleaner?

05:46.938 --> 05:48.633
No, I'm not

05:50.809 --> 05:53.175
No man, actually it's
a real good job...

05:53.345 --> 05:55.643
Pressure cleaning

06:12.264 --> 06:14.858

06:14.966 --> 06:16.558
Shit, I don't fucking

You ready?

06:18.303 --> 06:20.931

06:28.580 --> 06:30.275
You're just a sore winner

06:30.415 --> 06:31.848
Yeah, winner though,
man

06:31.950 --> 06:33.815
Oh, man that's all
my cast

06:33.985 --> 06:35.850
You spilled some good
shit there

06:35.987 --> 06:37.454
I'm gonna lick it up
like a dog

06:37.589 --> 06:39.284
We need 2 more

06:40.859 --> 06:42.728
What's that bulIshit?

06:42.728 --> 06:43.524
What time is it?

06:43.628 --> 06:45.892
The bar is closed

06:48.100 --> 06:50.159
Then why don't you take
that stick out of your ass...

06:50.335 --> 06:52.098
Now would be a good time,
don't you think huh?

06:52.237 --> 06:54.228
Now that the bar's closed

06:57.876 --> 07:00.367
What you do for is that?

07:05.250 --> 07:06.308
We had a good time
though

07:06.485 --> 07:09.181
Yeah, I know, it was fun

07:09.287 --> 07:11.084
I'm sorry, I called you
dumb dyke

07:11.890 --> 07:13.653
I don't care

07:15.460 --> 07:17.087
And thanks for the drinks

07:18.230 --> 07:19.857
No...No Problem.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.460
So see you around ok

07:21.566 --> 07:23.056
Do you wanna stay with
me?

07:23.735 --> 07:26.966
I didn't mean....you know
you don't have to do anything

07:27.205 --> 07:28.934
Shit I know

07:33.779 --> 07:34.677
Fuck it

07:34.946 --> 07:37.608
Yeah? My truck's
broken down

07:38.617 --> 07:43.111
Ok, car's over here,
come here, this way

07:46.124 --> 07:48.092
All I wanted was a beer

07:48.293 --> 07:52.423
But the day I met Selby I'd spent
most of the afternoon sitting in the rain,
about to kill myself

07:52.631 --> 07:53.825
So you can understand

07:53.932 --> 07:58.301
I was flexible, I mean everybody
gotta have faith in something

07:58.436 --> 08:01.530
For me? For me all I had left
was love

08:01.673 --> 08:03.868
And I was getting pretty sure that,
I wasn't gonna love a man again

08:04.042 --> 08:05.475
So I was gonna do it

08:05.777 --> 08:08.644
And the onIy reason I did it
was a five dollar bill

08:08.847 --> 08:11.441
I knew I probably given some
asshole a blowjob for it

08:11.650 --> 08:15.484
So really tried to piss me off that
if I killed myself without spending it

08:15.654 --> 08:17.884
Basically I sucked
him off for free

08:18.023 --> 08:19.547
So I made a deal

08:19.691 --> 08:21.989
I said God, I gotta spend
this 5 bucks

08:22.127 --> 08:23.788
But when it's gone
so am I

08:24.930 --> 08:28.331
If you've got something for me
in this life, you better bring it on

08:28.800 --> 08:30.563
And there she was

08:34.806 --> 08:37.673
Just some friends my parents
and I are staying with

08:41.746 --> 08:44.145
You wanna take a shower
or anything?

09:11.877 --> 09:14.846
Goodnite
-Goodnite

09:35.267 --> 09:37.235
I can't believe you
are here

09:39.237 --> 09:40.704
Me neither

09:47.012 --> 09:49.105
Can I touch your face?

09:55.754 --> 09:57.449
Sure

10:26.418 --> 10:27.578
Honey!

10:30.255 --> 10:34.419

10:37.362 --> 10:39.796

to be ready for church

10:41.866 --> 10:43.356
Hey, where's my shirt?

10:46.438 --> 10:50.067
Look at this, it's 5 o'clock in
the morning and she ain't dressed yet

10:53.445 --> 10:54.946
I'm sorry about that

10:54.946 --> 10:56.311
No, it's alrite

10:56.514 --> 10:58.175
Hey thanks for letting me crash

10:58.650 --> 11:00.015
No, that was nice

11:05.790 --> 11:07.382
So when are you leaving?

11:07.492 --> 11:08.823

11:08.994 --> 11:13.328
But you know, I'm gonna be hanging out

11:14.366 --> 11:16.857
About 2 blocks up
-Yeah yeah yeah

11:17.635 --> 11:19.398
Maybe I'll swing by

11:19.504 --> 11:21.472
Alrite

11:26.077 --> 11:28.341
You have fun at church,
alrite

11:35.120 --> 11:36.553
Who was that person?

11:37.055 --> 11:39.023
She's just a friend I made

11:39.157 --> 11:42.126
Honey, I think she was a
straight person

11:42.527 --> 11:45.519
Did you check your stuff,
because she might have stole something

11:45.630 --> 11:50.294
No...I checked it, she didn't
take anything

11:50.468 --> 11:55.929
Listen, honey, you cannot bring people
like that here, what if Charles had seen her?

11:56.508 --> 11:57.907
I'm sorry

11:58.043 --> 12:01.535
A person like that ... no Mdm

12:02.113 --> 12:04.946
We have no business with
people like that

12:17.295 --> 12:19.229
I'm just getting some stuff

12:19.631 --> 12:21.792
You'll give it to me when you get it

asshole like the last guy...

You're mean

14:34.566 --> 14:36.466
Can I ask you a question?

14:38.937 --> 14:41.030
Are you a prostitute?

14:43.608 --> 14:45.166
Yeah

14:47.712 --> 14:49.703
I don't know

14:50.381 --> 14:54.909
People like pay to be
with you, it's wild!

14:55.386 --> 14:58.844
Men must just line up
to be with a girl like you

14:59.757 --> 15:03.193
I guess, I don't know,
not really, you know!

15:05.430 --> 15:06.954
What do you do to them?

15:07.131 --> 15:09.531
All kind of things, you know,
whatever they want

15:09.634 --> 15:10.965
How do you know what
they want?

15:11.102 --> 15:12.535
Well they ain't shy
to tell you

15:12.704 --> 15:13.500
Really?

15:13.605 --> 15:15.197
Well shit, men are real
easy to read anyway

15:15.373 --> 15:17.238
Well, how about that guy?

15:24.349 --> 15:25.680
How about him?

15:25.783 --> 15:27.580
Oh, he's gay

15:27.719 --> 15:28.947
No way

15:29.120 --> 15:31.452
Yeah, man, look at him,
he tries too hard

15:32.523 --> 15:34.718
Oh man you see that
little fucker over there?

15:35.360 --> 15:38.727
Well he, he's straight up, S&M

15:39.931 --> 15:43.367
That's Trevor,
That's the son of the people I'm staying with

15:43.534 --> 15:45.001
Shit I'm sorry

15:45.136 --> 15:46.728
I don't care about that

15:48.273 --> 15:50.764
I don't realise he was gonna
be here

15:58.783 --> 16:03.584
This girl in my church, she told
everyone that I tried to kiss her

16:03.721 --> 16:06.019
So my parents
basically disowned me

16:06.157 --> 16:09.752
And I decided to come down here
and try to figure somethings out

16:09.827 --> 16:11.988
Then this happened
before I could get a job

16:14.032 --> 16:16.000
How long do you have to stay on?

16:16.134 --> 16:18.034
Not too much longer

16:18.403 --> 16:21.167
But my dad had to pay my medical bills

16:21.372 --> 16:24.432
So I made a deal with him,
that I would go back

16:24.609 --> 16:30.570
Which ...you know...it...probably
for the best...maybe it'll work

16:30.715 --> 16:35.880
Maybe he'll be able to save my
soul and all that

16:38.589 --> 16:42.389
Well I bet you twenty, I'll beat
your ass in a race, rite now

16:43.127 --> 16:44.355
Oh no...

16:44.495 --> 16:46.292
Oh yeah, me and you are gonna
hit the floor rite now

16:46.431 --> 16:49.161
Serious I can't skate

You gotta help me

I know, I've gotcha, come on

16:58.443 --> 16:59.740
There you got it

16:59.844 --> 17:01.675
You better not let
me break my other arm

17:01.846 --> 17:03.507
See you can do this

17:04.082 --> 17:05.709
Your're very good, man

17:06.317 --> 17:07.409
You think you can you do by yourself?

17:07.551 --> 17:08.951
Ok
-There you go

17:09.319 --> 17:10.445
Feel the music

17:23.701 --> 17:25.328

Oh, man I love this song

17:40.918 --> 17:42.510
Oh I love it too

17:45.223 --> 17:46.247
Just like that

17:46.491 --> 17:47.515
Oh I can't do that

17:47.692 --> 17:48.624
Yeah you can

17:48.793 --> 17:50.886
No, no, no,come on,
come with me

17:50.962 --> 17:52.122

17:52.397 --> 17:54.058
Who cares about him?

17:54.899 --> 17:56.799
Come on are you ready?

18:08.913 --> 18:10.881
So we don't hit anyone

18:13.684 --> 18:14.878
Are you ok?

19:30.862 --> 19:32.989
I can't, I can't do
this here

19:33.130 --> 19:34.893
Maybe we can go somewhere

19:43.608 --> 19:45.576
How about the yard
over there?

20:00.324 --> 20:01.882

20:08.332 --> 20:10.766

20:22.446 --> 20:26.906

could go somewhere

20:28.052 --> 20:30.043

a room or something

20:31.722 --> 20:34.054

money

30:23.747 --> 30:25.715
What the hell is happening here?

30:26.950 --> 30:29.578
Sorry it was me
I fell out of bed

30:29.686 --> 30:30.778
You didn't hear nothing?

30:31.221 --> 30:33.849
No, it's me I fell out of bed

30:41.298 --> 30:43.163
If that woman's in here, Selby, so help me god ..

30:45.903 --> 30:50.636
I had a talk with Trevor, and I really
don't appreciate what he told me

30:50.841 --> 30:52.968
I don't think your father
will either

30:54.444 --> 30:57.902
If she's in here, I want you
to get her out rite now!

30:58.782 --> 31:01.342
Or Charlie bound to blow
her head off

31:14.364 --> 31:15.626
What the hell are
you doing here?

31:18.535 --> 31:20.867
No man, I just wanted to see you

31:28.078 --> 31:29.773
I got in a fight

31:30.347 --> 31:32.178
It must have been a really long fight

31:32.316 --> 31:35.183
I got a man really
beaten me up, ok

31:38.488 --> 31:40.683
It wasn't my fault

31:45.262 --> 31:47.025
Are you ok?

31:54.504 --> 31:56.267
But it's cool now

31:56.907 --> 31:58.738
It's cool

31:59.076 --> 32:00.771
I was thinking...

32:01.812 --> 32:04.440
You know I want you to
stay a little longer

32:05.482 --> 32:07.317
Cause I can't

32:07.317 --> 32:08.375
Why not?

32:08.485 --> 32:11.147
Cause I told you
I promised my dad

32:12.656 --> 32:17.218
Well, he's your dad rite,
wouldn't he understand

32:17.261 --> 32:20.753
So I'm sure he can save
your soul a week from now, rite?

32:28.772 --> 32:32.230
See, I told you...
no problem rite?

32:34.578 --> 32:37.479
I was goona use it to take you
out tonite, but...

32:38.248 --> 32:41.183
That's enough to rent
a hotel for whole week

32:41.385 --> 32:45.617
We can party, hang out,
whatever you wanna do, you know

32:49.893 --> 32:51.793
Maybe I can come back

32:55.966 --> 33:00.164
No, you can't come back

33:00.537 --> 33:02.630
Cause I'll be gone

33:11.481 --> 33:13.142
Listen to me,

33:14.584 --> 33:17.678
This is a once in a life
time opportunity

33:18.622 --> 33:23.423
Give me a week, I'm gonna go
later I'll buy you fucking ticket

33:23.560 --> 33:26.427
I'll take you there
myself, just give me a week

33:29.299 --> 33:32.029
You'll never meet someone
like me again

33:41.211 --> 33:45.341
Ok
-Alrite

33:59.396 --> 34:01.193
Where did you get this car?

34:01.465 --> 34:03.330
I just borrowed it

34:46.877 --> 34:48.367
So what do we do now?

34:50.580 --> 34:52.377
Whatever?

34:59.256 --> 35:01.486
Cheers
-Cheers

36:07.090 --> 36:08.580
It's getting late

36:49.933 --> 36:52.163
Oh My God Selby!
We thought you were dead

36:52.335 --> 36:53.700
Donna, I'm sorry,
I just came and get some stuff

36:53.837 --> 36:55.828
No, honey, you are gonna
talk to your father

36:57.774 --> 36:59.071
You stand rite here!

36:59.276 --> 37:01.836

37:02.412 --> 37:03.879
She's here

37:04.180 --> 37:06.148
Ok, hang on, hang on

37:06.683 --> 37:08.048
Talk to your dad

37:09.819 --> 37:11.218

37:24.200 --> 37:25.861

37:26.036 --> 37:28.436

37:31.174 --> 37:37.079

I'm not even staying at Donna's anymore

37:46.923 --> 37:51.417
Ok..ok..I'm an adult now,
I'm gonna stay...

37:52.062 --> 37:54.929
And I gotta go

37:56.199 --> 37:57.826
What are you doing?

37:58.635 --> 38:03.334
She's not even...gay

38:03.473 --> 38:07.705
She's just some old street
hooker, she's just using you

38:16.586 --> 38:17.883
I quit

38:18.455 --> 38:19.683
What?

38:21.257 --> 38:22.986
What're your bags doing here?

38:23.093 --> 38:24.617
I'm staying

38:26.329 --> 38:29.594
Holy shit girl, you just
made my day

38:31.034 --> 38:32.331
How did you get them huh?

38:32.502 --> 38:34.231
I took a cab

38:35.338 --> 38:37.363
But Leen, you can take care
of me rite? cause...

38:37.507 --> 38:39.475
I've spent all our money

38:42.979 --> 38:44.640
It don't even matter

38:44.981 --> 38:46.915
What you said?
You quit?

38:47.083 --> 38:49.745
Hooking...I quit hooking

38:49.919 --> 38:51.113
Why?

38:51.655 --> 38:54.749
Why? because it's shit, it's time man,
I fucking hate it

38:55.191 --> 38:56.681
I thought you said
it wasn't that bad

38:56.826 --> 39:00.091
Oh..it is, you know, but,
not always, it's not the point

39:00.230 --> 39:01.925
I got you now

39:02.132 --> 39:04.225
I got everything going for me

39:05.068 --> 39:06.626
So I'm gonna do a broil

39:06.770 --> 39:09.136
This time I'm doing
it a broil

39:09.205 --> 39:10.331
How about that?

39:10.640 --> 39:13.336
Fine, but what are you
gonna do about work?

39:13.643 --> 39:16.407
ExactIy....I'll get a job

39:16.546 --> 39:21.176
Go clean...straighten up, you know,
fuck it, man, I'll get a career

39:21.985 --> 39:27.252
House, car...you know,
how about that

39:28.758 --> 39:31.124
What kind of job are
you gonna get?

39:31.428 --> 39:33.589
I've been thinking
about that

39:34.831 --> 39:37.231
I was thinking maybe like
a veterinarian, you know

39:37.367 --> 39:39.335
Cos I fucking love animals,
you know

39:39.436 --> 39:41.028
Yeah...

39:41.304 --> 39:45.434
But that's a doctor...
you gotta get a degree for that

39:46.409 --> 39:50.869
No, I'm not, no

39:51.748 --> 39:55.616
Shit, I know, you know
what I always wanted to be?

39:55.752 --> 39:57.219
What?

39:57.320 --> 39:59.754
President of the US

40:15.405 --> 40:18.238
I just haven't been feeling too good
lately, you know

40:21.745 --> 40:23.372
But I will though, man

40:24.047 --> 40:25.844
I'll be feeling great

40:30.120 --> 40:33.578
It's fucking
celebration time

40:34.457 --> 40:38.018
Oh yes this is...
this is big

40:38.161 --> 40:41.392
I once heard this thing that
always stuck with me

40:41.731 --> 40:42.959
I must've been around
13 years old

40:43.133 --> 40:46.330
Cause I remember I just
put the baby up for adoption

40:46.503 --> 40:48.494
They call the assembly
of my junior high

40:48.638 --> 40:50.765
Cause this guy who played
drum for certain workmen...

40:50.974 --> 40:52.737
Was coming to talk to
us about success...

40:52.876 --> 40:55.242
and making your mark
on the world

40:55.645 --> 40:59.103
I don't have any experience,
per se...

40:59.249 --> 41:02.514
I'm a real...I mean
I'm a real hard worker

41:02.685 --> 41:05.882
I was real excited, cause he was
the 1st real celebrity I've seen...

41:06.156 --> 41:07.953
And this was exactIy the
kind of thing I wanted to learn...

41:08.057 --> 41:09.854
How to follow in the
footsteps of ...

41:10.059 --> 41:11.219
I don't even write it
down, you know

41:11.361 --> 41:12.988
Just stay rite...
just stay rite there

41:13.196 --> 41:16.427
And you should know that
I've worked with people all my life

41:16.766 --> 41:19.462
So I'm real good with
people and...

41:20.403 --> 41:22.803
I know how to work the roledex

41:23.006 --> 41:24.667
So I listen real hard to any advice he had

41:26.209 --> 41:29.645
For sure he said something
that stuck rite in my real mind

41:29.779 --> 41:32.942
It was all you need in
life...is love

41:33.082 --> 41:34.481
And to believe in
yourself

41:34.784 --> 41:36.718
then there's nothing you can't do

41:39.656 --> 41:41.920
To make sure that i have all
this straight

41:42.091 --> 41:45.492
Basically, you've no experience,
no college degree...

41:45.628 --> 41:48.392
No resume, no work history
what-so-ever in fact

41:48.531 --> 41:50.965
And now you would
like to be...a lawyer

41:51.568 --> 41:55.334
No, see...I'm sorry,
but when I read the ad...

41:55.471 --> 41:57.336
It said you were looking
for a secretary

41:57.440 --> 42:00.204
Ok, well you need to
learn how to type...

42:00.343 --> 42:01.935
You'll need computer skills

42:02.078 --> 42:03.875
Most of our secretaries
have college degree

42:03.980 --> 42:07.040
Infact most of them have
specialised in law

42:07.183 --> 42:11.711
I don't mean to sound harsh, but
frankly this is a little insulting

42:14.157 --> 42:15.920
All that looks great,
It must be wonderful, but...

42:16.059 --> 42:17.356
Can I tell you something?

42:17.527 --> 42:21.088
When the beach party is over, you
don't get to say, you know what

42:21.264 --> 42:24.324
I think now I would like to have what everybody
else has worked their entire life for...

42:24.434 --> 42:26.026
It doesn't work that way

42:26.970 --> 42:28.835
Fuck you, man!

42:29.005 --> 42:30.336
Yeah fuck you!

42:30.440 --> 42:32.374
You don't fucking
know me

42:32.475 --> 42:34.568
Ok, great, that's great, see?

42:34.711 --> 42:39.478
Now I'm so sorry I didn't hire you before.
Leslie could you please escort miss...

42:39.582 --> 42:42.346
I don't even know her name, because of course
she doesn't have a resume...

42:42.452 --> 42:44.977
No need, you fucking asshole,
you piece of shit

42:45.121 --> 42:47.055
What you think I'm
fucking retard?

42:48.224 --> 42:49.691
Take your fucking job and fucking shove it!

42:50.894 --> 42:52.987
Fuck you Leslie!

42:53.596 --> 42:57.396
All I need is love and to
believe in yourself

42:57.867 --> 43:02.099
Nice idea, it doesn't exactIy
work out that way

43:02.238 --> 43:06.231
But I guess it was better to hear
flat out lying then to know the truth at thirteen

43:10.146 --> 43:14.412
Fuck this phoney shit, told him to fuck himself,
kiss my fucking sweet ass

43:14.984 --> 43:17.646
Slamped me out of the fucking
door, just like that, man

43:18.288 --> 43:19.755
What did he do?

43:21.424 --> 43:22.914
Not a fucking thing

43:23.426 --> 43:25.792
Not one fucking thing

43:25.995 --> 43:26.927
Stupid mother fucker

43:27.096 --> 43:29.656
I've bet nobody fucking ever talked
to him like that in his whole life

43:29.799 --> 43:32.962
Fucking office job, who the
fuck wants a job like that

43:33.102 --> 43:34.437
You gotta fucking sitting
in a little desk...

43:34.437 --> 43:35.369
You got your little phone...

43:35.505 --> 43:37.302
You got your piece of paper,
your little pen...

43:37.440 --> 43:39.169
You write shit down,
bla bla bla

43:39.242 --> 43:42.439
Fucking a monkey can
do that shit, man, fuck!

43:42.745 --> 43:44.440
I thought you wanted a
job like that

43:44.580 --> 43:46.172
You know what?

43:46.349 --> 43:48.510
No. Toby, 2 more

43:49.385 --> 43:52.354
Honey, AI says I can't give you
any tab

43:52.455 --> 43:55.959
Toby, how long have I
been the customer here?

43:55.959 --> 43:57.688
Would you cut me some
fucking slack here?

43:59.095 --> 44:01.120
Go get me 2 more

44:02.932 --> 44:06.595
Fucking lazy bastard,
it's no big deal, man

44:06.769 --> 44:09.260
Al runs a tab all the time
you know...

44:09.405 --> 44:11.305
he just probably doesn't
know it

44:11.441 --> 44:14.376
Leen, what are you
gonna do?

44:14.510 --> 44:16.842
I got it on fucking
control, man

44:20.583 --> 44:23.074
I'm kind of starving here

44:27.423 --> 44:30.392
There's no way, you could
maybe ah...

44:31.394 --> 44:33.555
I don't know, call your
dad or...

44:34.197 --> 44:40.261
Yeah I know I know,
I'm just saying for you, you know?

44:42.338 --> 44:45.501
Fuck it, man, I got shit
line up, you know

44:46.642 --> 44:48.872
It's not a fucking big deal

44:52.348 --> 44:54.475
Can I just give it to
you straight

44:55.551 --> 44:58.213
The truth is,
I'm...I'm a hooker

44:58.488 --> 45:00.547
I'm trying to clean my life up
here, you know...

45:00.723 --> 45:02.987
Go straight and questions
and all, so...

45:03.126 --> 45:06.152
If there's any link that you
can help me with...

45:09.365 --> 45:11.333
That's because I was...
-That's not even matter gonna matter

45:11.501 --> 45:12.535
Because the best you're gonna get is
factory work

45:12.535 --> 45:15.197
Hey Todd, do we even have any
factory work?

45:15.671 --> 45:17.161
Fuck!

45:17.540 --> 45:20.407
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to talk to you here ...

45:26.883 --> 45:29.044
You don't have any
change, do you?

45:49.172 --> 45:52.039
Madam, I'm afraid I've to
ask you to come with me

45:52.275 --> 45:53.537
Why?

45:53.776 --> 45:55.767
Well we've had some complains
out here, so ...

45:59.148 --> 46:01.309
So what they complained about?

46:01.517 --> 46:05.078
Cause I just got out,
it's my day off

46:05.788 --> 46:07.653
A day off?

46:08.324 --> 46:12.192
And what's a day off for a
whore, you go to church or something?

46:26.642 --> 46:28.507
Don't you remember me?

46:28.611 --> 46:30.272
No

46:31.314 --> 46:34.249
I busted you not eight months ago for
tricking up on 95

46:37.520 --> 46:40.216
It seems to me you might
owe me one

46:41.557 --> 46:43.855
Yeah, you sure went easy
on me

46:45.094 --> 46:46.789
You almost broke my
fucking jaw

46:46.996 --> 46:49.430
Please, you do time

46:51.300 --> 46:53.165
Climb over

47:37.513 --> 47:38.775
Sel?

47:40.850 --> 47:42.340
Selby?

47:43.052 --> 47:46.681
Selby? Jeses Christ,
what're you doing

47:46.756 --> 47:48.155
What the fuck are you doing?

47:52.161 --> 47:53.287
Please drop the fucking blade

47:53.396 --> 47:55.296
I take you to a fucking
doctor, ok

47:55.464 --> 47:56.863
Just stop it

48:01.204 --> 48:03.104
What are you talking about?

48:03.339 --> 48:04.431
You can stop Leen.

48:04.540 --> 48:05.472
Stop what?

48:05.608 --> 48:07.439
You can stop the game

48:08.177 --> 48:11.237
I'm out there trying
my best, ok?

48:11.414 --> 48:13.382
Why did you quit
hooking?

48:13.816 --> 48:17.513
Cause I needed to,
alrite?

48:17.653 --> 48:20.019
Because you thought I was stupid,
enough to support you?

48:20.122 --> 48:21.555
No, Selby

48:21.691 --> 48:23.488
That you wouldn't even
have to fuck me to get it

48:23.626 --> 48:24.615
Because I'm so hard-up

48:24.727 --> 48:26.786
No! no! Selby, that's
not the reason

48:26.896 --> 48:29.057
You said we were gonna
party, party, party...

48:29.198 --> 48:30.961
Well there hasn't been a fucking party!

48:33.402 --> 48:36.337
Nothing! when I told you
that I'm starving

48:37.707 --> 48:39.572
Cause you're using me
-No! I just...

48:41.077 --> 48:43.739
Because I fucking killed
someone, alrite?

48:50.686 --> 48:53.985
My last john, alrite,
I fucking killed my last john

48:54.156 --> 48:56.954
I was raped and beat to
fuck and was gonna get killed

48:57.126 --> 48:59.651
But I won't...I didn't wanna
lose you, you know...

48:59.762 --> 49:01.559
All I could think about was that for the rest of
your fucking life

49:03.266 --> 49:06.429
And you never know that
I fucking meant to be there

49:06.969 --> 49:09.802
I didn't wanna die,
thinking that maybe

49:10.373 --> 49:12.398
Maybe you could love me

49:13.609 --> 49:15.668
So I killed him

49:16.078 --> 49:22.347
I shot him, alrite...
I fucking shot him

49:29.959 --> 49:32.427
I'm sorry, I let you
fucking down alrite

49:32.561 --> 49:35.359
Now, you know me Sel,
now you fucking know me alrite

49:39.935 --> 49:41.300
No, I don't wanna go

49:41.504 --> 49:43.529
Sure you do,
sure you fucking do!

49:43.639 --> 49:47.200
Leave me fun,
leave me fucking fun!

49:53.616 --> 49:55.413
I'm sorry

50:26.615 --> 50:28.515
I know...

50:29.685 --> 50:31.744
He would have killed killed you

50:48.037 --> 50:49.698
I need to get this taken off and
I'm gonna get a job

50:52.174 --> 50:55.974
No, I understand that
if you can't get a work

50:56.245 --> 50:58.042
I don't even mind

51:01.217 --> 51:04.709
I wanted to go back before
it was just...so shit scared of getting caught

51:04.854 --> 51:07.084
You know that was the
onIy reason

51:13.896 --> 51:15.796
I'm a hooker

51:47.530 --> 51:49.122
You got a wet pussy?

51:51.934 --> 51:53.765
Yes, sure

51:54.937 --> 51:56.529
You like to fuck?

51:59.742 --> 52:01.175
Yup

52:03.112 --> 52:07.549
Jesus Christ, you'll think nobody
ever talked dirty to you before

52:09.952 --> 52:12.785
I just like to settle
first, you know

52:16.158 --> 52:18.683
Call me daddy,
while I fuck you

52:19.428 --> 52:22.329
I try, what you like
to fuck your kids?

52:22.965 --> 52:33.705
What? I'm just kidding
with you

52:34.443 --> 52:36.343
I'm just messing with you

52:37.213 --> 52:39.204
I'll call you daddy

52:39.882 --> 52:41.713
Daddy, see?

52:41.851 --> 52:43.443
See, I'm calling you daddy

52:43.486 --> 52:45.181
I do it all the time

52:47.923 --> 52:49.151
$20 huh?

52:49.658 --> 52:51.455
Yup

52:54.396 --> 52:56.296
Some good shit here!

53:04.039 --> 53:07.531
Come on, you wanna suck it for me

53:10.312 --> 53:11.779
Come on baby

54:28.791 --> 54:32.192
Life is funny...it's hard

54:32.661 --> 54:36.825
But it's also strange, how things can
be so different than you think

54:38.500 --> 54:41.663
I remember I was just a
kid in before age club...

54:41.770 --> 54:47.140
Set up this beautiful gigantic red and yellow ferris
wheel. It lit up to nite sky

54:47.810 --> 54:51.143
They called it....the Monster

54:53.148 --> 54:54.410
You want some money?

54:57.820 --> 55:00.345
Oh my god,
are you serious?

55:00.889 --> 55:03.858
When I was a kid I thought tht was
about the coolest thing I ever seen

55:03.993 --> 55:05.858
Then I couldn't wait to ride it

55:06.028 --> 55:09.429
Sure enough, when I finally got my
chance I got so scared and nauseous...

55:09.598 --> 55:12.931
I threw up all over myself
before it even made 1 fulI turn

55:13.869 --> 55:15.734
I gonna go and wash up ok

55:24.980 --> 55:27.182
Just hang on a sec, babe, I gotta
wash up here, ok?

55:27.182 --> 55:28.774
Ok

55:30.653 --> 55:33.144
Hey where did you
get the car?

55:35.824 --> 55:43.253
My friend, Thomas, saw me on my way
home, he let us borrow it to move

55:44.099 --> 55:45.191
We're moving?

55:45.334 --> 55:47.097
Yes, fuck this place, rite?

55:47.202 --> 55:49.329
This no place for my girl

55:50.172 --> 55:53.642
Oh, man, a real place?
an apartment?

55:53.642 --> 55:56.634
Ya what you happy now?
-Yeah, I'm happy

55:56.679 --> 55:58.874
I know baby, I know

56:00.215 --> 56:02.308
We're good now,
I told you

56:02.418 --> 56:04.147
And that's what I mean

56:04.253 --> 56:08.155
In my life, it has always been the
harmless stuff that hurt the most

56:09.058 --> 56:12.255
When there're things so horribly,
you can't even imagine it

56:12.394 --> 56:14.919
It's usually a lot easier
than you think

56:17.166 --> 56:20.761
You never really know,
until you're the one standing there

56:55.838 --> 56:57.169
No problem

57:01.043 --> 57:02.533
How is your arm?

57:05.013 --> 57:06.571
It looks weird

57:17.793 --> 57:19.260
So ok?

57:27.503 --> 57:30.028
Cos I knew I was coming
home to you

57:41.984 --> 57:43.952
I love you

59:51.346 --> 59:52.608
Waitress

01:00:00.923 --> 01:00:04.620
This stuff is so good
thanks for taking me here

01:00:06.028 --> 01:00:09.657
It's ok, it's ok you know

01:00:10.165 --> 01:00:13.657
It's pretty fine, but .. man, someday
I'm gonna take you to some...

01:00:13.769 --> 01:00:17.432
Real top places in the
Keys, like some real classy joints

01:00:17.539 --> 01:00:19.473
Keys?
-Yeah

01:00:19.608 --> 01:00:21.269
I always wanna go to Keys

01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:24.344
I always wanna have a
house on the beach, you know

01:00:24.479 --> 01:00:27.039
But I haven't even been to the beach
since I've been here

01:00:27.215 --> 01:00:30.309
So gal I'll buy you a house
on the beach, how about that?

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.414
Those places are like thousands
of thousands of dollars

01:00:34.523 --> 01:00:38.220
So what? You think I can't
get you a house on the beach?

01:00:39.828 --> 01:00:41.352
What else you want?

01:00:44.433 --> 01:00:46.924
You want a little purple porsh huh?

01:00:47.836 --> 01:00:49.360
This is no-smoking area

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:51.769
You have to put the cigarette out

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.065
What are you doing, man?
you gonna sing us a song or what?

01:00:54.209 --> 01:00:55.335
Let me have that

01:00:55.377 --> 01:00:56.071
Get your fucking hand off her

01:00:56.211 --> 01:00:57.974
You piece of shit!

01:01:02.417 --> 01:01:04.476
We're paying fucking
customer here

01:01:04.653 --> 01:01:07.451
What? what you got?

01:01:07.556 --> 01:01:09.251
You wanna bring it on?

01:01:10.826 --> 01:01:12.487
You all better watch your
fucking food...

01:01:12.594 --> 01:01:15.563
Cos there was a fucking cockroach
in mine, size like this

01:01:15.697 --> 01:01:18.291
This is not how you run a
fucking establishment man

01:01:43.859 --> 01:01:45.986
So what's your deal, man?

01:01:46.495 --> 01:01:48.053
Where you like to fuck

01:01:49.531 --> 01:01:51.431
Like to fuck in the back?

01:01:51.867 --> 01:01:53.835
So really like to get
real rough?

01:01:57.172 --> 01:02:00.369
Shit, I bet you get real
rough back there huh?

01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:02.272
Real nasty

01:02:02.744 --> 01:02:04.405
You like that huh?

01:02:06.648 --> 01:02:09.014
Maybe you wanna slap me
round a little bit huh?

01:02:11.319 --> 01:02:13.480
Don't think I don't
see it, man

01:02:14.489 --> 01:02:16.684
What, you can't speak?

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:17.548
What, you got a
fucking problem?

01:02:17.759 --> 01:02:18.885
Cat got your fucking tongue huh?

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:22.296
I don't like it rough

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:31.230
I've never done this before,
but I have....

01:02:56.465 --> 01:02:58.558
Take your pants off

01:03:39.207 --> 01:03:40.868
Thank you.

01:03:44.479 --> 01:03:46.276
You are welcome

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:36.593
You wanna have a
beer with me?

01:04:39.568 --> 01:04:41.092
Don't you wanna
come to bed?

01:04:42.771 --> 01:04:44.602
In a minute

01:05:05.794 --> 01:05:06.954
Wake up

01:05:08.496 --> 01:05:10.794
Wake up, I wanna go out

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:34.377
Hey, mind if I  angle in on those nuts?

01:05:39.661 --> 01:05:41.322
This guy is an asshole right...

01:05:42.797 --> 01:05:44.765
Flick his chair over,

01:05:45.867 --> 01:05:49.394
Fucking office job rite?

Sounds like you're at fun world

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:03.542

01:06:03.818 --> 01:06:06.446

01:06:27.642 --> 01:06:29.269
In that fucking car?

01:06:29.878 --> 01:06:32.210

01:06:36.484 --> 01:06:38.042
What the fuck were you doing?

01:06:38.219 --> 01:06:40.312
I was out, we needed stuff

01:06:40.455 --> 01:06:43.982
We don't need this
fucking shit, Selby

01:06:44.326 --> 01:06:46.760
Who the fuck told you
to take that fucking car?

01:06:47.228 --> 01:06:48.718
Leen what difference
does it make?

01:06:48.863 --> 01:06:49.830
The difference?

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:51.428
Because I'm fucking borrow
a car from my friend...

01:06:51.599 --> 01:06:54.193
That's my fucking business,
ok, that's what?

01:07:00.008 --> 01:07:02.977
I'm gonna go any place
that I want to

01:07:03.178 --> 01:07:05.146
Ok? any time I want

01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:07.474
Not in my fucking friend's
car, you are not!

01:07:07.615 --> 01:07:09.845
Fine, fine, then I'll walk

01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:13.750
Ok, I don't wanna sit
here alone all the time,

01:07:13.922 --> 01:07:15.787
I wanna go out I wanna
meet people

01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:20.350
I wanna hang out with people
without you fucking scaring them off

01:07:25.066 --> 01:07:26.727
Where would you like to go?

01:07:26.968 --> 01:07:28.265
I don't know...

01:07:28.436 --> 01:07:32.668
Travel...see different
places

01:07:33.575 --> 01:07:35.600
We could go to Fun World

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:38.975
You wanna go to Fun World?

01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:41.110
Not now

01:07:41.249 --> 01:07:43.615
No, now I gotta take the
fucking car back

01:07:43.718 --> 01:07:46.983
And now we don't have any
fucking money like usual, Selby

01:07:47.088 --> 01:07:48.282
So, you're leaving?

01:08:09.077 --> 01:08:10.738
Hey Selby, check it out

01:08:11.946 --> 01:08:13.743
Hey, there're my friends

01:08:14.983 --> 01:08:17.975
Hey remember me?

01:08:18.252 --> 01:08:20.050
I figure you guys would be here

01:08:28.662 --> 01:08:30.062
I loved her...

01:08:30.598 --> 01:08:33.032
But the thing no one ever
realised about me...

01:08:33.134 --> 01:08:35.533
Was believe that I could learn

01:08:36.104 --> 01:08:38.800
I could train myself into
anything

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:43.241
People always look
down their noses at hookers

01:08:43.978 --> 01:08:47.538
Never give you a chance because
they think you took the easy way out

01:08:47.715 --> 01:08:52.118
And no one could imagine the
will power it took to what we do

01:08:52.287 --> 01:08:55.950
Walkin the streets,
nite after nite

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:59.416
Taking the hitch and still
getting back up

01:08:59.461 --> 01:09:01.189
We wanna go again

01:09:01.296 --> 01:09:04.493
But I did,
and they don't miss out

01:09:05.133 --> 01:09:09.001
Cause they've no idea what
I can discipline myself to

01:09:09.304 --> 01:09:11.328
And I believe in something

01:09:12.474 --> 01:09:14.567
And I believed in her

01:09:18.712 --> 01:09:20.044
I need to sit down

01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:22.939
Oh there she is
-Who is she?

01:09:24.051 --> 01:09:25.484
I gotta talk to her

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:27.451
Hey you wanna ride
the Ferris Wheel?

01:09:27.856 --> 01:09:29.288
Nope

01:09:31.326 --> 01:09:33.020
We're gonna go sit down

01:09:57.352 --> 01:09:58.717
Are you ok?

01:10:10.698 --> 01:10:13.030
My brothers and sisters,
screwed me royal

01:10:13.535 --> 01:10:16.663
After my daddy killed
himself, we were out on the streets

01:10:16.905 --> 01:10:20.636
And the neighbors would let them stay
over but onIy if I didn't tag along

01:10:20.742 --> 01:10:22.073
So I stayed clear

01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:24.440
But I knew they didn't have
any money, you know

01:10:25.246 --> 01:10:26.713
I was having a hook
anyway...

01:10:26.881 --> 01:10:31.553
So I always made sure they had new cloths,
cigarettes, and stuff like that

01:10:31.553 --> 01:10:35.614
But then there's 1 nite, we're at this party and this
guy comes in and he's like ...

01:10:35.723 --> 01:10:37.384
She fucked so and so

01:10:37.825 --> 01:10:39.793
And they're are all embarrassed..

01:10:40.028 --> 01:10:42.588
They were fucking standing
in the corner, all...

01:10:43.064 --> 01:10:47.797
So they...you know they
threw me out of the snow

01:10:48.136 --> 01:10:51.367
Screaming out, I'm a whore,
and they were so embarrassed...

01:10:51.573 --> 01:10:53.666
And they hate me
and all that

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:56.009
And that was it

01:10:56.144 --> 01:10:59.671
I just took off never
went back

01:11:00.114 --> 01:11:01.775
That's really sad

01:11:02.817 --> 01:11:04.751
Your own family doing that to you

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:07.081
That's how people are,
Selby

01:11:07.188 --> 01:11:09.713
Yeah...I know

01:11:09.857 --> 01:11:12.223
Fuck them,
who need them?

01:11:12.627 --> 01:11:13.787
Right

01:11:14.028 --> 01:11:15.120
Yeah, fuck them!

01:11:15.263 --> 01:11:17.163
No, right, Selby, right!

01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:31.511
Get out!
get the fuck out!

01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:34.907
You all ok?

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.578
I'm gonna call an ambulance

01:11:40.622 --> 01:11:42.112
That's ok

01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:43.989
We don't have any insurance

01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:46.821
We just rather...
do it ourselves

01:12:02.043 --> 01:12:03.635
You know, she's good

01:12:04.145 --> 01:12:06.272
You have yourselves a
good day now, ok

01:12:19.894 --> 01:12:23.193
Let's go, Selby, now!
-No! no! I wanna drive

01:12:27.001 --> 01:12:29.401
He's fucking dead,
let's go, now!

01:12:30.271 --> 01:12:32.296
No!
-Selby!

01:12:46.654 --> 01:12:48.849
Who killed that man?

01:12:50.692 --> 01:12:52.319
What do you think?

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:57.161
Oh my god, they're coming for us

01:12:59.067 --> 01:12:59.999
What are you talking
about?

01:13:00.134 --> 01:13:02.261
You fucking killing people

01:13:06.808 --> 01:13:10.403
Now listen to me,
they are not coming

01:13:13.281 --> 01:13:16.614
I never wanted you in this
shit to begin with

01:13:16.751 --> 01:13:18.981
But I know what
I am doing

01:13:19.153 --> 01:13:20.745
And you'll never gonna
understand it, alrite?

01:13:20.888 --> 01:13:22.856
You gotta trust me

01:13:30.131 --> 01:13:32.867
They don't have
1 fucking thing

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.027
They got nothing

01:13:34.168 --> 01:13:37.899
They are not even looking, man,
this shit is long over already

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:42.169
I didn't want wreck the fucking car in public
but we did you know, we did

01:13:42.276 --> 01:13:45.837
So if they'll gonna call the cops,
they would've done it by now!

01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:49.849
How could you?

01:13:51.018 --> 01:13:52.451
You knew

01:13:57.892 --> 01:14:01.123
No...I knew about 1...1

01:14:01.262 --> 01:14:05.858
No, Selby...no Sel

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:16.209
Come in here

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:25.310
We're gonna have a drink, and we're
gonna forget about all this alrite?

01:14:25.386 --> 01:14:26.978
Cheers

01:14:28.055 --> 01:14:29.386
Leen, this isn't funny

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.854
You don't know what's
going on, Sel

01:14:32.126 --> 01:14:36.222
I do, so if you wanna keep your
eyes shut to the whole world...

01:14:36.798 --> 01:14:39.358
The least you can do
is hear me out

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:55.316
It's not what you
think it is, alrite

01:14:55.316 --> 01:14:56.283
I know what it is

01:14:56.384 --> 01:14:58.784
No, you don't know
my life, Selby!

01:15:00.288 --> 01:15:02.256
But I know yours

01:15:05.927 --> 01:15:08.623
And I've done everything
in the whole wide world

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:11.325
Hoping that you'll never
have to know

01:15:12.166 --> 01:15:16.330
So that you can go on
thinking that people are good

01:15:16.437 --> 01:15:20.141
And kind and that it should
make sense, you know?

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:22.371
Cause I love that
about your, Sel

01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:23.272
But I can't

01:15:23.377 --> 01:15:26.369
No, I don't wanna hear
that, Leen

01:15:27.014 --> 01:15:28.379
But you need to

01:15:28.549 --> 01:15:31.347
We can be as different as we
wanna be, but you can't kill people

01:15:41.863 --> 01:15:44.297
I'm good with the Lord

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:46.022
I'm fine with him

01:15:48.536 --> 01:15:50.401
And I know how you were raised alrite

01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:54.304
And I know how people fucking think out
there and fuck it's gotta be that way

01:15:54.408 --> 01:15:55.375
They gonna tell you that 'thou shall not kill' and
all that

01:15:58.045 --> 01:16:00.036
But that's not the way the
world works, Selby

01:16:00.181 --> 01:16:03.378
Cause I'm out there,
every fucking day living it

01:16:04.085 --> 01:16:07.452
Who the fuck knows,
what god knows?

01:16:10.791 --> 01:16:14.128
People kill each other everyday

01:16:14.128 --> 01:16:15.755
And for what?

01:16:17.465 --> 01:16:21.925
For politics, for religion,
and they're heros...

01:16:22.103 --> 01:16:25.869
No..no...there are a lot of
shit I can't do anymore

01:16:25.907 --> 01:16:27.340
But killing's not one of them

01:16:27.408 --> 01:16:31.139
And letting those fucking bastard going out
there raping somebody else isn't either

01:16:31.345 --> 01:16:33.210
No, no, Leen there
was 1 man

01:16:33.347 --> 01:16:35.406
They can't all
has been bad

01:16:36.751 --> 01:16:41.188
You know me, you think
I could do it otherwise?

01:16:41.489 --> 01:16:45.789
I'm not a bad person,
I'm a real good person

01:16:48.529 --> 01:16:52.932
So, don't feel bad,
it's life, Sel

01:16:53.034 --> 01:16:57.300
People like me and you go
down every fucking...day

01:17:03.911 --> 01:17:06.607
It's almost over,
look at this

01:17:07.848 --> 01:17:10.442
See this?
it's everything

01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:12.779
Everything you ever
wanted

01:17:12.954 --> 01:17:15.923
Just a little more, and a car
we're out of here

01:17:16.023 --> 01:17:17.820
We have a shot, Sel

01:17:19.026 --> 01:17:24.123
We have a shot, at a real life,
not this, a real one

01:17:29.937 --> 01:17:31.268
You know what to do, rite?

01:17:33.774 --> 01:17:35.639
See you later
-Ok

01:17:38.279 --> 01:17:40.770
So everything is working out,
and we are real happy

01:17:40.982 --> 01:17:43.075
But I just thought that you
can tell my family

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.350
So you're choosing to go
this way

01:17:50.491 --> 01:17:53.358
No, this isn't a choice
I'm not choosing anything

01:17:53.494 --> 01:17:56.361
This is the way I am

01:17:56.497 --> 01:17:58.465
And I'm not gonna feel
bad about it anymore

01:17:58.532 --> 01:18:00.693
You can tell him that too

01:18:02.670 --> 01:18:06.037
I know you think you're all romantic
about that girl

01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:17.981
What? I'm saying it's
not their fault

01:18:18.552 --> 01:18:21.248
Blacks or whoever you wanna
call them, Selby

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:25.520
The point is, people make
bad choices

01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:29.626
And they pay for it, you can see
all these miserable straight people...

01:18:29.997 --> 01:18:32.864
And we see you choosing, this life ..
this gay life

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.332
And even more than that, the easy life with this ...

01:18:35.503 --> 01:18:38.631
No..she has had a real hard life

01:18:40.141 --> 01:18:43.338
Lots of people have bad lives, and they
still choose to move towards the light...

01:18:43.444 --> 01:18:46.572
Otherwise we all be
hookers and druggies...

01:18:48.282 --> 01:18:50.113
I don't wanna hear this

01:18:50.384 --> 01:18:52.113
This is not the point

01:18:52.787 --> 01:18:55.017
Don't fight the world, honey

01:18:55.589 --> 01:18:58.456
There's so much more than just love out there

01:18:58.559 --> 01:19:04.020
And someday all you gonna want is a roof
over your head even if you do have to sleep
with a man to get it

01:19:04.498 --> 01:19:05.965
And that's your choice

01:19:06.133 --> 01:19:08.624
Yeah, it is my choice

01:19:08.803 --> 01:19:11.328
Cos we're in love

01:19:11.439 --> 01:19:13.600
What? We you going on a hike?

01:19:17.111 --> 01:19:18.703
Man, just get rite here

01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:21.105
The car was good

01:19:21.649 --> 01:19:24.413
Not when there's a
fucking gun in it

01:19:26.554 --> 01:19:30.320
So, lots of people have guns

01:19:33.594 --> 01:19:36.791
Well you gonna undress or what?

01:19:36.964 --> 01:19:38.659
No, you 1st

01:19:42.603 --> 01:19:48.132
So...you married rite?
you don't get that fucking shit

01:19:48.609 --> 01:19:51.544
Come out here with strange gals,
do dirty things with them

01:19:53.147 --> 01:19:55.138
Why, man, so you can rape them?

01:19:56.684 --> 01:20:00.279
No, Good lord
-Fucking man

01:20:00.488 --> 01:20:02.285
I fucking hate them

01:20:02.490 --> 01:20:04.287
Then why are you a hooker?

01:20:04.425 --> 01:20:07.861
I'm not a hooker, see,
I don't fuck, man

01:20:08.596 --> 01:20:11.827
Used to, mostly against my will though

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:14.628
This old guy used to rape me when I was eight

01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:18.432
Real good friend of my
dad's, you know

01:20:20.007 --> 01:20:22.202
So I go to my dad,
tell him what's going on...

01:20:22.343 --> 01:20:24.504
My dad don't fucking
believe me, so...

01:20:24.645 --> 01:20:26.636
His friend keeps raping
me for years

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:33.576
And that's my dad...fucking
beats me up for it

01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:38.356
Where the fuck do you
think you are going?

01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:42.663
I'm not doing it,
but I feel sorry for you

01:20:42.663 --> 01:20:45.131
If you want a ride
you better come on

01:20:45.266 --> 01:20:47.461
I don't need a ride, man

01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:50.827
I don't need a ride

01:20:54.508 --> 01:20:56.999
Cause I wanna take
your car

01:20:57.845 --> 01:20:58.903
You fucking think I'm stupid
enough...

01:20:59.046 --> 01:21:02.812
To get back into your fucking car
with you when there's a gun?

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:06.817
Please!

01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:12.557
Victor Borne,
that was his name

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:16.687
My dad's friend...
some friend

01:21:19.433 --> 01:21:22.095
Years later I found out he
died in a car accident

01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:27.607
Its like God finally strike him down
for all his evil

01:21:28.342 --> 01:21:31.402
No, you can't get away
from your shit forever

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:35.872
Sooner or later,
it's gonna catch up with you

01:21:36.217 --> 01:21:37.809
Motherfucker!

01:21:38.719 --> 01:21:40.186
Where's the car?

01:21:41.755 --> 01:21:43.689
Got all fucked up!

01:21:44.758 --> 01:21:46.783
Is that everything?

01:21:46.961 --> 01:21:50.727
Got beer? fucking man,
I think we should just go

01:21:50.798 --> 01:21:51.526
How?

01:21:51.699 --> 01:21:53.189
Take the bus

01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:54.732
We have enough money, rite?

01:21:54.935 --> 01:21:55.697
We do?

01:21:55.769 --> 01:21:58.203
I don't know whatever,
I'll fucking hook down there whatever

01:22:00.341 --> 01:22:02.243
We can't take all our shit
on the bus

01:22:02.243 --> 01:22:04.404
I can't get one rite now,
ok, Sel

01:22:06.247 --> 01:22:07.475
What happened?

01:22:07.648 --> 01:22:10.674
Fucking cop, the guy
I wasn't even gonna do it...

01:22:10.784 --> 01:22:12.149
Then he has a fucking
gun in his car ...

01:22:12.319 --> 01:22:14.617
So I popped him sure enough
he's a fucking cop

01:22:15.422 --> 01:22:17.549
I think he was retired or
something but still, man...

01:22:17.691 --> 01:22:19.158
I can't take the fucking car,
it was a cop car

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.157
It got some fucking tracking device in there

01:22:21.328 --> 01:22:21.919
Shit!

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:24.826
Fucker, tried to fucking trick me,
while he's got a fucking gun in there

01:22:24.932 --> 01:22:26.695
Keep it down

01:22:30.638 --> 01:22:33.072
Well you just have to go
and get us another one

01:22:36.944 --> 01:22:40.180
No...no...not changing your
mind on me

01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:41.374
Please

01:22:41.482 --> 01:22:45.475
Leen ...this isn't my plan
this is your deal, ok

01:22:45.619 --> 01:22:47.917
Your plan, the house
and the beach

01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:50.780
Self-employed,
just like you said, your plan

01:22:50.891 --> 01:22:52.722
So you just have to go and
get us another car...

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:54.794
We are leaving now

01:22:55.696 --> 01:22:57.459
Get up!

01:23:00.801 --> 01:23:07.172
Alrite....you just give
me a sec

01:23:23.490 --> 01:23:26.186
I'm gonna try to get out of
here before the end of the week

01:23:26.927 --> 01:23:29.589
That's good,
I'm proud of you

01:23:29.763 --> 01:23:32.288
Yes, I just wanted to say
good bye to you, Tom

01:23:32.433 --> 01:23:33.957
You've been real
good to me

01:23:38.806 --> 01:23:39.966
Are you alrite?

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.631
Yes, it's nothing

01:23:45.412 --> 01:23:48.575
Sometime, I feel like everybody
just think I'm just a fat shitty fucking person

01:23:49.883 --> 01:23:52.653
All I'm fucking trying
to do is survive, you know

01:23:52.653 --> 01:23:54.678
I know
-Yeah

01:23:54.855 --> 01:23:56.482
I know exactIy

01:23:56.924 --> 01:23:59.051
I know what you
do for living

01:23:59.226 --> 01:24:00.784
But It doesn't bother
me at all

01:24:00.894 --> 01:24:04.330
I know you didn't dial it up
on a god dammed telephone

01:24:04.465 --> 01:24:07.559
That's where you lended,
that's what you've had to do

01:24:07.735 --> 01:24:11.466
What you're feeling rite now,
is just guilt

01:24:11.572 --> 01:24:14.775
Over something you've had
absolutely no control over

01:24:14.775 --> 01:24:17.642
You know how many of us
came back from the war?

01:24:17.778 --> 01:24:19.109
And almost kill ourselves...

01:24:19.279 --> 01:24:22.612
Because we felt exactIy the
samething you do rite now!

01:24:22.983 --> 01:24:24.917
Yeah?
-Yeah

01:24:25.018 --> 01:24:26.110
And I never get it

01:24:26.253 --> 01:24:28.278
They don't get it now,
they never get it then...

01:24:28.422 --> 01:24:31.448
And they sure as hell wouldn't
ever get fucking circumstances

01:24:31.592 --> 01:24:35.892
Fuck, man, circumstance that's
exactIy it, that's exactIy it

01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:38.888
You know, it's like I feel
like I never had a fucking choice

01:24:38.999 --> 01:24:41.365
You never did,
but you got a live

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:44.033
You got a live

01:25:02.856 --> 01:25:06.849
We are not able to positively
confirm a profile at this time...

01:25:06.927 --> 01:25:09.395
However the evidence does
suggest that...

01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:13.890
The murderers had their current
stirring some face of the Central Act

01:25:14.067 --> 01:25:15.932
Perhaps that's the act
prostitution?

01:25:22.609 --> 01:25:25.737
Yeah, that's exactly right

01:25:35.422 --> 01:25:36.946
Get the fuck out of here

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:39.783
Get the fuck out of here!

01:26:40.254 --> 01:26:42.586
These here my kids

01:26:43.023 --> 01:26:44.490
They are down in Miami...

01:26:44.691 --> 01:26:47.888
So I'm just trying to make
a couples of extra bucks, you know what i'm saying?

01:26:50.731 --> 01:26:52.323
They ok?

01:26:55.035 --> 01:26:56.764
They are fine

01:26:57.504 --> 01:26:59.734
I'm just trying to
make some money

01:27:01.375 --> 01:27:03.070
Can you help me out?

01:27:04.278 --> 01:27:07.907
Maybe I can help you
out, you know?

01:27:08.015 --> 01:27:12.179
If you need some help, I'll do what
I can to get you back with your kids

01:27:12.452 --> 01:27:17.446
Maybe you need a room,
shower, some warm clothes...

01:27:17.658 --> 01:27:19.353
My son's room is empty
if you want it

01:27:19.593 --> 01:27:22.585
And I'm sure my wife
wouldn't mind a bit

01:27:22.930 --> 01:27:24.124
PulI the car over
-I'm sorry

01:27:24.264 --> 01:27:25.731
No, just pulI the car over

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.465
The car's still rolling,
you can't get out

01:27:28.635 --> 01:27:30.000
Stop...the car

01:27:30.671 --> 01:27:34.038
Listen, they can't barely see
you out there

01:27:47.821 --> 01:27:50.051
Are you in some kind
of...

01:27:52.092 --> 01:27:54.287
Just drive the car

01:28:09.576 --> 01:28:11.066
Stop rite here

01:28:12.713 --> 01:28:15.910
Look there ain't othing that we can't fix

01:28:18.619 --> 01:28:20.587
Get out of the car

01:28:31.164 --> 01:28:35.498
The keys in the car,
that's my wallet

01:28:39.673 --> 01:28:41.106
Turn around

01:28:41.208 --> 01:28:43.301
No, madam...no

01:28:45.145 --> 01:28:46.806
You don't have to do this

01:28:46.913 --> 01:28:47.937
Get down

01:28:49.650 --> 01:28:51.641
You really don't

01:28:55.222 --> 01:28:56.519
I can't

01:28:56.723 --> 01:28:58.156
You don't have to

01:28:58.325 --> 01:29:02.091
You just having a hard time
-No, I can't let you live

01:29:04.865 --> 01:29:08.699
Oh God, my wife...

01:29:09.002 --> 01:29:13.132
My daughter is having a baby
-Shut the fuck up!

01:29:16.410 --> 01:29:18.241
Oh God I'm sorry

01:29:51.078 --> 01:29:52.545

01:30:41.394 --> 01:30:43.225
Where I wanted to go

01:31:24.638 --> 01:31:29.439

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:52.898
Maybe you can...
help me?

01:32:05.011 --> 01:32:09.004
I don't know...if I can
forgive myself for...

01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:23.296
You'll come back to me,
You'll come back

01:32:34.507 --> 01:32:40.070
I mean, you come back here
and we go far far away

01:32:46.386 --> 01:32:47.580

01:32:57.998 --> 01:33:01.092
No

01:34:26.252 --> 01:34:30.245
Hey, this is my onIy
friend, Tom

01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:37.587
We've got a fire outside,
the old conversation pit

01:34:39.299 --> 01:34:40.823
Oh come on

01:34:54.848 --> 01:34:57.373
You run away fast
-What?

01:34:57.550 --> 01:35:00.610
Yes you are, I wanna
drive you out of here

01:35:03.056 --> 01:35:07.015
I gotta stay here by the
phone for my girl

01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:09.153
Cause I gotta call her

01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:12.360
Cause she left, Tom

01:35:13.233 --> 01:35:16.999
But she's gonna come back, ok

01:35:18.838 --> 01:35:21.432
You've got a fucking wife and
you tell me to come with you...

01:35:21.541 --> 01:35:24.066
What the fuck are you
doing, man?

01:35:24.210 --> 01:35:29.113
Not you, Tom,

01:35:29.416 --> 01:35:31.179
Fuck, man!

01:35:45.031 --> 01:35:47.192
You got some bucks

01:35:47.567 --> 01:35:48.864
You want change?

01:35:49.069 --> 01:35:50.331
Yeah I gotta call

01:35:50.437 --> 01:35:52.337
Let's go, I got some
change in my car

01:35:52.505 --> 01:35:53.631
So if you want, come
with me

01:35:57.644 --> 01:35:59.407
My car is over there

01:35:59.646 --> 01:36:02.479
Yes, rite over there,

01:36:12.559 --> 01:36:14.959
Man, what the fuck

01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:26.405
Just want to fucking call my girl

01:36:35.648 --> 01:36:38.640
Selby?
-Hi

01:36:39.486 --> 01:36:41.784
Oh man, it's good to
hear your voice

01:36:41.921 --> 01:36:43.115
Yeah you too

01:36:43.289 --> 01:36:44.916
So, you back down
here huh?

01:36:45.191 --> 01:36:49.491
Yeah, I came down to
see what was going on

01:36:52.098 --> 01:36:56.091
Oh man, am I glad to hear that

01:36:58.605 --> 01:37:01.665
Yeah?
-no, we all rite, because...

01:37:01.808 --> 01:37:06.108
They caught in here with some old
warrant or something, you know

01:37:07.447 --> 01:37:09.244
But, I'm...

01:37:11.217 --> 01:37:12.275
Where are you now?

01:37:12.452 --> 01:37:14.113
In a motel room

01:37:15.655 --> 01:37:18.647
I wished I was there
with you rite now

01:37:22.295 --> 01:37:27.062
But Leen ... they went
up to see my parents

01:37:27.333 --> 01:37:29.267
They were asking all
kind of questions

01:37:30.036 --> 01:37:32.061
Yeah, you now well

01:37:32.705 --> 01:37:35.572
I rather not talk on the
phone here, you know...

01:37:35.675 --> 01:37:40.169
Because, because I don't
know if they're, you know...

01:37:40.346 --> 01:37:43.406
But...don't worry about
that, Sel

01:37:43.583 --> 01:37:47.178
I mean that's just some mistaken identity
or something, you know

01:37:47.587 --> 01:37:48.815
They've got nothing

01:37:48.988 --> 01:37:51.224
So just talk about
us, you know?

01:37:51.224 --> 01:37:54.785
I can't Leen, my picture's
on the paper

01:37:55.161 --> 01:37:57.356
From when we crashed the car

01:37:58.364 --> 01:38:02.528
Selby...what are you
talking about?

01:38:02.702 --> 01:38:05.865
I'm talking about when
we crashed the red car

01:38:07.106 --> 01:38:08.733
Why are you saying that?

01:38:08.908 --> 01:38:11.706
Cause I'm freaking out...
they know Leen

01:38:12.445 --> 01:38:16.506
They know, and they've come after me,
and I know, I'm gonna go down

01:38:16.649 --> 01:38:24.522
No, Selby, I wouldn't do that,
you know, I would never do that ok

01:38:24.857 --> 01:38:28.816
So...just chill out
here, ok?

01:38:28.962 --> 01:38:30.657
How am I supposed
to do that?

01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:33.230
You gonna let me go down for
something you did

01:38:33.333 --> 01:38:37.326
Selby, I didn't do anything

01:38:42.542 --> 01:38:45.067
Leen, you know what
I'm talking about

01:38:48.715 --> 01:38:50.307
What are you doing?

01:38:52.151 --> 01:38:53.982
I'm not doing anything

01:38:58.992 --> 01:39:01.222
Where's the money, Sel?

01:39:03.062 --> 01:39:04.791
What money?

01:39:05.665 --> 01:39:09.294
The money I gave you

01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:12.734
What are you talking about?

01:39:14.474 --> 01:39:17.068
I don't know what are
you talking about, Leen

01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:26.612
Nothing, just some change

01:39:26.753 --> 01:39:29.688
Yeah, I got that

01:39:35.395 --> 01:39:38.125
I just wanna leave, Leen

01:39:39.666 --> 01:39:42.134
I just want a normal
happy life

01:39:42.268 --> 01:39:44.600
I don't know why you
did this

01:39:47.807 --> 01:39:49.741
Cause I love you

01:39:52.011 --> 01:39:57.779
Cause I love you, and I never
wanted to lose you that's all

01:39:59.052 --> 01:40:04.046
I love you with all my heart,
my soul, my mind

01:40:04.824 --> 01:40:08.954
And I never let you
down, alrite

01:40:12.598 --> 01:40:14.395
Cause it was me

01:40:15.735 --> 01:40:18.761
It was onIy me

01:40:18.971 --> 01:40:21.030
And I'll tell them that, ok

01:40:21.307 --> 01:40:23.298
But it's over for me now

01:40:23.543 --> 01:40:25.841
I'm never gonna see you again

01:40:44.197 --> 01:40:46.529
That people could forgive you for
something like this, you know?

01:40:49.102 --> 01:40:50.797
But they can't...

01:40:50.937 --> 01:40:52.734
They can't end

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:49.159
Thank you Judge

01:41:49.929 --> 01:41:52.591
And may you rot in hell...

01:41:52.698 --> 01:41:56.429
Sentence a raped women to death

01:41:56.669 --> 01:42:00.264
And you all, you are just
bunch of scum, that's what you are

01:42:09.449 --> 01:42:11.280
Faith can move mountains

01:42:12.318 --> 01:42:14.718
Love would always run away

01:42:16.022 --> 01:42:18.547
Everything happens for a reason

01:42:19.492 --> 01:42:22.928
For when there's life, there's hope

01:42:27.033 --> 01:42:28.694
Hope...

01:42:29.202 --> 01:42:31.136
They've gotta tell you something

01:42:32.305 --> 01:42:38.825
