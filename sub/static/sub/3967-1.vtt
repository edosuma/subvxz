00:41.680 --> 00:42.841
<i>Peace.</i>

00:44.280 --> 00:48.842
<i>Long ago, before The Founders
established this great city of ours,</i>

00:49.080 --> 00:51.321
<i>that word was all but meaningless.</i>

00:52.120 --> 00:55.090
<i>An ideal as elusive as a dream.</i>

00:55.320 --> 00:57.322
<i>Now, 200 years later,</i>

00:57.760 --> 01:01.924
<i>we are, all of us, living proof
that peace is indeed attainable.</i>

01:02.800 --> 01:06.600
<i>The reason for this is,
of course, our Faction System.</i>

01:06.680 --> 01:11.402
<i>Erudite, Dauntless, Amity,
Candor, Abnegation.</i>

01:11.480 --> 01:14.927
<i>In dividing people according
to personality and aptitude,</i>

01:15.000 --> 01:19.005
<i>we've created a society in which
each faction plays a critical role</i>

01:19.120 --> 01:21.441
<i>in maintaining the social order.</i>

01:21.560 --> 01:24.325
<i>But this harmony we've
achieved is now under attack</i>

01:24.640 --> 01:26.768
<i>from a small but extremely dangerous group</i>

01:26.840 --> 01:28.251
<i>of individuals-</i>

01:28.320 --> 01:31.005
<i>We call them Divergents.</i>

01:31.520 --> 01:33.045
<i>They are, in essence,</i>

01:33.160 --> 01:35.640
<i>the worst of what humanity used to be.</i>

01:35.800 --> 01:39.521
<i>Rebellious, defiant and uncontrollable.</i>

01:40.840 --> 01:43.571
<i>Five days ago, a rogue group of Divergents,</i>

01:43.680 --> 01:44.886
<i>posing as Dauntless</i>

01:45.080 --> 01:47.048
<i>brutally invaded Abnegation.</i>

01:47.200 --> 01:49.407
<i>An obvious attempt
to cripple the Faction System</i>

01:49.520 --> 01:51.682
<i>by attacking it's most vulnerable members.</i>

01:54.080 --> 01:56.048
<i>These Divergents despise our system</i>

01:56.160 --> 01:58.208
<i>because they are incapable
of conforming to it.</i>

01:58.400 --> 02:00.323
<i>These latest rumors, for example,</i>

02:00.400 --> 02:03.290
<i>that I was somehow behind
the attack on Abnegation?</i>

02:03.360 --> 02:06.762
<i>Nothing more than Divergent propaganda.</i>

02:07.240 --> 02:08.969
<i>I am devoting myself</i>

02:09.039 --> 02:11.247
<i>to bringing these fugitives to justice.</i>

02:11.720 --> 02:13.245
<i>I've exercised my right</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:14.970
<i>as acting Council leader...</i>

02:15.040 --> 02:16.451
<i>...to declare martial law</i>

02:16.560 --> 02:20.360
<i>until I'm confident that any threat
to our security has been eliminated.</i>

02:20.720 --> 02:22.051
Tell Jeanine we got it.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.690
<i>We are all
that is left of humanity.</i>

02:27.760 --> 02:30.366
<i>The vast wall that encloses this city</i>

02:30.840 --> 02:33.286
<i>may protect us from our toxic surroundings,</i>

02:33.760 --> 02:35.444
<i>but it is up to us to confront</i>

02:35.560 --> 02:38.131
<i>any element that could
poison us from within.</i>

02:38.560 --> 02:41.040
<i>Because, when you are
civilization's last hope,</i>

02:41.240 --> 02:45.609
<i>peace is not merely an ideal.
It is an obligation.</i>

02:46.200 --> 02:48.362
<i>And it is up to all of us to take a stand</i>

02:48.480 --> 02:50.482
<i>against it's one true enemy,</i>

02:52.080 --> 02:53.411
<i>Divergents.</i>

03:26.160 --> 03:27.161
Amity.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.090
We need to make sure it's clear.

03:32.800 --> 03:33.926
Tris!

03:50.640 --> 03:53.644
Help us. Please help us. Please.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.000
Please help us.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.121
You have to help us.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.646
Sorry, you have to leave.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.122
You just don't belong here.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.970
It's all her fault.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.646
You killed Will.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.850
No.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.851
She killed him.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.367
She killed him. She killed him.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.886
She killed him.

04:25.840 --> 04:26.887
Mama.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.047
Mama.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.087
You killed us all.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.326
Will!

06:27.360 --> 06:29.408
And three!

06:29.480 --> 06:30.481
Higher!

06:32.800 --> 06:33.800
Hey.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.171
Higher! Higher!

06:35.360 --> 06:36.441
Wanna go higher?

06:36.800 --> 06:38.370
All right, everyone, back to class.
Let's go.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.164
Okay. Here we go.

06:40.520 --> 06:41.646
See ya. Bye.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.643
I just wanted to do something different.

06:57.640 --> 06:58.687
Yeah.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.529
Well, it's definitely different.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.081
You don't like it?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.328
No, I like it. I like it a lot.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.410
I'm just surprised, that's all.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.605
What's goin' on, Tris?

07:24.680 --> 07:28.765
Nothin'. I'm fine. Just...

07:30.840 --> 07:31.887
Still having nightmares?

07:35.880 --> 07:37.006
No.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.041
We're good.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.371
You and me.

07:47.720 --> 07:50.246
I know nothing else is. But we are.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.888
<i>Good morning,
and have a blessed day.</i>

07:56.400 --> 07:57.925
Time for chores.

08:05.200 --> 08:09.285
<i>All planters, report to the dome.
All planters to the dome.</i>

08:13.080 --> 08:15.120
How much longer
do we have to stay here, Four?

08:15.360 --> 08:17.089
Until we know
it's safe to leave.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.607
Hey.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.241
Hi.

08:50.840 --> 08:51.841
Son...

08:55.440 --> 08:57.124
You can't ignore me forever.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.404
I know you're thinkin'
about your next move,

09:01.480 --> 09:02.970
but there are things you don't know.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.645
Marcus, please just leave us alone.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.930
Your mother didn't come back
to Abnegation just to save you.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.690
She died trying to hide
something from Jeanine.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.809
Something that was entrusted
to Abnegation a long time ago.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.286
Marcus, stop.

09:15.480 --> 09:18.324
Whatever you want from us,
you're not gonna get it.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.846
I'm not the enemy here.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.450
You found it.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.640
It was in the home
of Natalie and Andrew Prior,

09:43.720 --> 09:44.721
like you said.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.003
Mind telling me what's inside?

09:54.880 --> 09:56.928
A message from The Founders
that will ensure

09:57.000 --> 09:58.809
the future our people deserve.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.204
Divergents will destroy our society.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.844
Unless we destroy them.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.525
And now we can.

10:15.880 --> 10:19.566
However, only a Divergent
can open this box.

10:25.160 --> 10:29.210
Find them. Every last one of them.

10:47.440 --> 10:48.726
Go with happiness.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.281
Go with happiness.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.929
- Go with happiness.
- Thank you.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.200
Go with happiness.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.721
Go with happiness.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.690
I really don't know how much longer

11:03.760 --> 11:05.603
I can do this whole peace and love thing.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.160
It's the Amity way, all right?
We're just trying to blend in.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.730
I'm trying to blend in.
It's just not working.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.082
Comin' through on your right.
Okay, here we go.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.646
Hey, look, a rainbow.

11:15.760 --> 11:16.761
- Oh.
- It's pretty.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.441
Go with happiness.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.000
Virtual pathological friendliness
with unquestioned passivism?

11:21.080 --> 11:23.765
I love this place.
Thank you. Go with happiness.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.090
Oops, excuse me.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.764
Hey, Tris, I really like your hair, by the way.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.321
Did you try to cut it all short
and weird like that?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.568
Peter, why don't you take
your food and sit down, huh?

11:32.640 --> 11:33.641
Or what?

11:36.240 --> 11:38.049
Besides, I think we should all
stick together now that we're

11:38.120 --> 11:39.770
- all officially fugitives.
- Shh.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.251
Wait, what do you mean,
"officially fugitives"?

11:41.440 --> 11:42.566
- Oh, you don't know?
- Let's go, let's go.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.086
You didn't tell Caleb?

11:44.320 --> 11:46.800
Yeah, so now Jeanine is saying
that the attack on Abnegation

11:46.960 --> 11:49.725
was orchestrated by a group
of renegade Divergents

11:49.800 --> 11:51.290
and their sympathizers.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.641
So then they're blaming
this whole thing on us?

11:52.840 --> 11:57.641
Yeah. Jeanine needed a reason to petition
the Council to institute martial law.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.491
Now she has one.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.485
Staying here at Amity
is still our best option for now.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.161
We need to keep an ear to the ground.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.163
Find out where the rest
of the Dauntless are.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.849
Then we can make a move.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.844
We need to kill Jeanine.

12:21.640 --> 12:22.641
I know.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.730
But we're not ready yet.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.888
Beatrice, you're not being serious, right?

12:31.360 --> 12:33.124
No, I am being serious.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.407
I'm not gonna stop until she's dead.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.648
Tris, you can't just go
around killing people.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.240
No, she's right.
Listen to your sister.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.964
Tris, I think you should go to Erudite

12:43.040 --> 12:44.530
and kill Jeanine yourself.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.521
I'll stay with Caleb so that
you don't get him killed, too.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.166
What?

12:52.680 --> 12:53.841
Come on, you know.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.245
Like you did your parents.

13:12.720 --> 13:13.767
Come on!

13:16.160 --> 13:17.685
What do you think you're doing?

13:20.520 --> 13:22.727
My office. Now.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.846
Enjoy your meal, everyone.
Enjoy your meal.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.202
Calm down.
Just calm down.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.569
Was I not clear that the terms
of your sanctuary here

13:39.680 --> 13:41.284
included nonviolence?

13:42.360 --> 13:45.250
I can guarantee you nothing like this
will ever happen again.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.249
Well, be that as it may,

13:48.360 --> 13:49.964
you can no longer stay here with us.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.400
Your presence is just too disruptive.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.287
Truth is that our sanctuary
was never gonna last

13:58.440 --> 14:00.124
very long here anyways.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.926
Was it?
With you not standing up to Jeanine.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.689
You don't understand us at all.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.761
No, I do understand you.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.087
I understand that you think
you can stay out of this.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.480
But you can't.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.046
One day she's gonna show up and
Jeanine is gonna take whatever power

14:14.120 --> 14:15.167
you think you have away from you.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.281
Tris, Tris...

14:19.760 --> 14:23.651
Look, Johanna,
we need a little more time.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.890
I need to find out where
the rest of the Dauntless are.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.007
Then we can leave.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.124
And then what?
Attack Erudite?

14:30.240 --> 14:32.368
I will not be a party to violence.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.760
And no one's asking you to.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.969
We just need a few more days.

14:40.640 --> 14:41.641
One.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.490
One what?

14:45.840 --> 14:48.161
One more chance.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.011
See, to be Amity is to forgive.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.524
Others. And yourself.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.124
You're hurting, Tris.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.002
And my heart goes out to you.

15:07.840 --> 15:11.242
I know what it's like to stand helpless

15:11.320 --> 15:12.640
while you lose the ones you love.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.002
But killing Jeanine is not going to
bring your mother back.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.850
I know you're angry.

15:21.960 --> 15:24.201
But you're letting it consume you.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.003
What is it?

15:46.680 --> 15:48.762
Stay here.
And keep quiet.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.601
Gentlemen,

16:11.600 --> 16:13.602
Amity welcomes you.

16:13.720 --> 16:14.960
To what do we owe the pleasure?

16:15.040 --> 16:16.690
This isn't really a social call, Johanna.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.285
We're looking for Divergents.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.931
I see. Well, of course,
anything we can do to help.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.401
Gonna need you to volunteer
your faction to be tested.

16:26.920 --> 16:27.967
New screening technology

16:28.080 --> 16:29.491
- from Erudite.
<i>- Amity...</i>

16:29.560 --> 16:32.928
Now that Jeanine's heading up the Council,
the approval process just got a little easier.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.929
You're exceeding your jurisdiction.

16:35.040 --> 16:39.602
Now, Johanna, what happened
to that Amity politeness?

16:41.080 --> 16:45.130
The easy way or the hard way?
It's up to you.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.086
All right.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.569
But under protest.

16:54.760 --> 16:58.003
Okay, we're good to go!
Move it out! Round 'em up.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.167
In the dome.

16:59.240 --> 17:01.368
<i>All Amity report to the dome</i>

17:01.440 --> 17:03.886
<i>for new mandatory testing.</i>

17:05.400 --> 17:08.961
<i>Please proceed to the dome
for mandatory testing.</i>

17:10.599 --> 17:12.520
In the building.
Let's go. Get inside.

17:12.839 --> 17:14.000
Line up.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.685
Let's go. Move it.

17:18.800 --> 17:19.961
This way.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.281
Line it up.

17:24.599 --> 17:25.761
Building secured.

17:28.119 --> 17:29.724
You know something, lady?

17:31.440 --> 17:33.807
You seem awfully stuck in that doorway.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.802
Eric's here.
We need to move now. Come on.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.005
What's up there?

17:59.440 --> 18:01.520
- Wait, stop.
- Just my office.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.851
Go, go, go!

18:18.000 --> 18:19.161
Hmm.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.527
Hey.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.204
There's two guards with guns.

18:26.520 --> 18:27.681
We're going out the window?

18:30.040 --> 18:31.121
We need to split up.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.441
Okay, yeah. Okay.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.205
Every man for themselves.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.047
Good.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.166
- Hey, they're up here! Hey!
- Go, go, go, go!

18:45.040 --> 18:47.361
Eric, they're up here!
Come on, they're getting away!

18:48.960 --> 18:51.122
All right, you ready?

19:00.400 --> 19:01.561
Let's go.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.882
- Where?
- Out the window.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.040
I got three on foot making
a break toward the dome.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.162
<i>- Divergent.</i>
- Got one.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.402
<i>I repeat,
three on foot toward the dome.</i>

19:14.880 --> 19:16.086
Over there!

19:16.720 --> 19:18.404
- I demand amnesty!
- Get down! Now!

19:18.520 --> 19:20.409
I'm the leader of Abnegation!
It is my right!

19:28.760 --> 19:30.000
Detain him!

19:30.080 --> 19:32.447
- Whoa. Okay. All right.
- Let's go.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.761
Oh, oh. Ow.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.601
Come on.

19:40.600 --> 19:41.931
Come on, keep moving.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.526
Come on!

20:04.440 --> 20:05.441
Come on.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.647
Let's go!

20:31.720 --> 20:33.085
Keep going. Come on.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.489
- Listen!
- What?

20:42.600 --> 20:43.601
Train!

20:45.840 --> 20:47.171
Go, go, go!

20:51.160 --> 20:52.400
Go! Come on!

20:52.520 --> 20:53.760
Caleb!

20:54.600 --> 20:55.601
Keep moving!

21:02.360 --> 21:03.361
Go!

21:05.120 --> 21:06.326
Ammo!

21:21.040 --> 21:22.610
Come on, come on! Go! Go! Move!

21:42.000 --> 21:43.490
Move! Go, go, go!

21:43.560 --> 21:44.846
Caleb!

21:45.320 --> 21:46.321
Move!

22:21.920 --> 22:24.924
Oh, you folks sure know
how to make an entrance.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.366
Factionless.

22:31.440 --> 22:32.521
Amity?

22:34.200 --> 22:35.850
But you stand like Dauntless.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.123
No idea what this one is.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.601
Look, we just need to get
to the city, that's all.

22:41.720 --> 22:46.362
Well, too bad. Train's taken.
And you damaged our cargo.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.208
These are
Abnegation fabric bolts.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.211
And you're Factionless, right?

22:54.280 --> 22:55.805
- Caleb.
- I used to be Abnegation.

22:55.920 --> 22:59.083
We used to use those same bolts
to make clothes for you.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.644
You're saying that we're stealing from you?

23:03.760 --> 23:05.649
No. No, no, no.
I'm no longer Abnegation.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.570
So technically you're
not stealing from me, but...

23:07.640 --> 23:09.483
No, you're not stealing at all.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.483
I mean, maybe.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.200
It's a question of semantics, I suppose,

23:13.240 --> 23:14.241
whether it's stealing or charity.

23:14.320 --> 23:15.401
But it's all really the same.

23:15.480 --> 23:16.891
That's enough! Get off!

23:16.960 --> 23:18.880
Everybody, relax.
All right, you made your point.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.490
We'll get off your train, all right?

23:20.560 --> 23:22.403
Got you.
Will just everybody relax, okay?

23:22.480 --> 23:24.164
Why don't we, uh, take a seat!

23:26.400 --> 23:27.600
Caleb!

23:27.640 --> 23:29.005
- Stop!
- I'm sorry,

23:29.120 --> 23:30.167
- I was just trying to help.
- Don't!

23:30.240 --> 23:31.480
Oh, yeah, this is gonna be fun, isn't it?

23:31.560 --> 23:33.801
Everybody, just calm down. All right?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.001
Oh.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.401
Caleb.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.001
Ahhh!

25:00.600 --> 25:01.601
No!

25:02.080 --> 25:04.606
Get off of me! Get off!

25:31.720 --> 25:33.404
You all right? You okay?

25:34.600 --> 25:35.726
Yeah.

25:45.400 --> 25:46.481
Tobias Eaton.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.451
You say that again.

25:48.960 --> 25:51.486
Tobias Eaton.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.640
What? You know him?

25:56.080 --> 25:57.445
I am him.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.329
We have been looking for you.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.650
Four, what are they talking about?

26:10.160 --> 26:11.286
Four.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.321
Follow me.

26:33.760 --> 26:34.807
Tris.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.286
I'm sorry. I wanted to help...

26:47.200 --> 26:48.201
Four.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.161
Four, why are they looking for you?

26:52.360 --> 26:54.010
How do they know your name?

27:07.040 --> 27:08.530
This is Factionless?

27:10.600 --> 27:12.011
This is insane.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.011
Tobias.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.001
Mother.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.480
I thought she was dead.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.725
Me too.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.281
Someone please tell me
what's going on here.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.361
Tobias' father was very abusive.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.128
I knew the only way
I could ever truly escape him

28:38.240 --> 28:41.403
would be to disappear completely.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.241
Abnegation helped me fake my death.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.168
Anything to protect Marcus' image.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.406
But you just left him
there alone with Marcus?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.490
I was very young.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.847
I reached out to him about a year ago.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.642
I felt it was finally time to reconnect.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.244
I'm still your mother.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.687
No, my mother's dead.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.729
I went to her funeral when I was six.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.085
And she wasn't trying to reconnect with me.

29:14.160 --> 29:17.482
She was trying to use me, like you are now.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.161
Why?

29:19.960 --> 29:20.961
She wants an army.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.161
An army?

29:23.320 --> 29:24.481
I want an alliance.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.164
No, what you want is revenge.

29:26.280 --> 29:27.691
This isn't about me.

29:27.760 --> 29:31.924
It's about putting an end to a system that
says one group is more deserving than another.

29:32.040 --> 29:33.929
This city may be surrounded by a wall,

29:34.040 --> 29:36.202
but it doesn't have to be a prison.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.970
- I think that's a bit extreme.
- Hmm?

29:39.040 --> 29:41.964
I mean, the Faction System isn't perfect,
but it's hardly a prison.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.371
Let me guess. Erudite.

29:47.680 --> 29:48.727
I was Erudite.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.331
You willing to kill Jeanine?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.729
Absolutely.

29:58.640 --> 30:01.120
When I was married to Marcus,
I knew her well.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.124
And believe me,
there's nothing she isn't capable of.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.487
But I think you already know that.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.403
Tris, we can't trust her.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.404
Or maybe she knows...

30:10.480 --> 30:12.482
We're on the same side, Tris.

30:13.680 --> 30:17.002
I'm Factionless because
I don't fit into any one faction.

30:17.080 --> 30:20.004
And you're Divergent because
you belong to too many.

30:20.640 --> 30:22.722
But we're both a threat to Jeanine.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.401
My people are ready for war,
if that's what it takes.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.567
And then what?

30:29.400 --> 30:31.050
We depose those in power.

30:31.400 --> 30:32.440
And once you've done that?

30:34.080 --> 30:35.411
Once you've killed Jeanine,

30:35.880 --> 30:37.245
who's in power then?

30:38.360 --> 30:40.169
See, that's the part

30:40.240 --> 30:42.208
that she always conveniently leaves out.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.011
Don't you tell me this isn't about you.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.844
This is only about you.

30:51.440 --> 30:53.522
I know where the remaining
Dauntless are hiding.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.127
Where?

30:55.360 --> 30:56.930
They took shelter in Candor.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.884
As far as I know, they're still there.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.601
Think about it.

31:01.080 --> 31:04.607
If we were to combine forces,
Dauntless and Factionless,

31:05.440 --> 31:06.805
we'd be unstoppable.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.251
That's not gonna happen.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.887
Thank you for your hospitality,

31:10.960 --> 31:12.962
but we'll be leaving in the morning.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.451
Four, maybe this is...

31:14.600 --> 31:16.284
Tobias, please, reconsider.

31:17.760 --> 31:18.761
Don't you call me that.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.091
My name's Four.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.808
You wanna tuck him in, or should I?

31:55.640 --> 31:59.167
Well, this... This meal looks lovely.

32:02.160 --> 32:03.241
Thank you.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.611
I'm sorry.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.488
I should have told you about her.

32:38.360 --> 32:42.046
No more secrets. Okay?

32:53.240 --> 32:56.403
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.081
I always loved watching him sleep.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.641
I take it you're setting out
for Candor in the morning?

33:10.160 --> 33:11.241
Yeah.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.842
Listen, I only want what's best for him.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.605
You hardly even know him.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.049
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?

33:29.040 --> 33:30.530
But deep down, I think you're scared

33:30.600 --> 33:31.761
I know him all too well.

33:34.600 --> 33:35.840
I'm not scared.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.526
Of course you are.

33:38.120 --> 33:41.761
You're scared he'll finally see you
for what you really are.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.765
Deadly.

33:48.280 --> 33:49.691
You don't believe me?

33:53.920 --> 33:55.126
Ask him.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.566
You okay?

34:04.440 --> 34:05.487
Yeah.

34:07.800 --> 34:08.960
You sure?

34:09.560 --> 34:10.891
Yeah.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.331
I'm not coming with you guys.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.161
What?

35:05.040 --> 35:08.647
To Candor.
I'm not coming with you guys.

35:11.880 --> 35:12.960
What are you talking about?

35:13.360 --> 35:14.691
What's your plan?

35:16.200 --> 35:17.964
You guys are gonna find
the rest of Dauntless. Then what?

35:18.440 --> 35:21.728
You attack Erudite, assassinate Jeanine,
start a civil war?

35:23.720 --> 35:26.200
I'm sorry, I'm just not...
I'm not cut out for that.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.211
I'm not like you guys.

35:34.120 --> 35:36.407
I need to go back to Abnegation, maybe.

35:36.640 --> 35:37.880
Sort out what our parents left behind.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.644
At least I'd be useful there.

35:39.840 --> 35:42.366
Caleb, there's nothing left at Abnegation.

35:45.160 --> 35:46.207
Yeah.

36:19.280 --> 36:20.281
You okay?

36:20.440 --> 36:22.090
Just need to get to Candor.

36:26.040 --> 36:27.087
Tris.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.291
I know you think Caleb
is your responsibility,

36:33.400 --> 36:34.686
but he made his own choice.

36:36.560 --> 36:37.766
You can't protect everyone.

36:39.720 --> 36:41.051
I can't protect anyone.

36:41.920 --> 36:42.921
Nobody can.

36:44.520 --> 36:45.885
Him leaving isn't your fault.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.567
None of this is your fault.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.091
Johanna was right.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.645
You have to forgive yourself.

37:01.760 --> 37:02.807
Thank you.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.120
<i>All factions
have been instructed to</i>

37:04.280 --> 37:06.840
<i>- maintain a strict curfew until further notice.</i>
- We gotta move.

37:07.440 --> 37:10.728
<i>Repeat.
All factions have been instructed</i>

37:10.800 --> 37:13.565
<i>to maintain a strict curfew
until further notice.</i>

37:32.760 --> 37:34.649
- We found them.
- Yeah.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.000
Four!

37:39.840 --> 37:40.921
Damn, is it good to see you guys.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.081
How are you, Uriah?

37:42.160 --> 37:44.003
I'm better now.
I'm not exactly built for laying low.

37:44.080 --> 37:46.003
- Tris!
- Christina.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.802
- It's so good to see you.
- You too.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.489
Have you heard anything about Will?

37:56.320 --> 37:58.368
- No.
- Nothing?

37:59.360 --> 38:00.361
No.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.604
Something must have happened to him.

38:03.880 --> 38:06.008
He would have found me by now, you know?

38:07.680 --> 38:09.682
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.811
How you holdin' up?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.206
How many Dauntless do we have?

38:14.320 --> 38:15.401
Hundred and seventy-five. Total.

38:15.520 --> 38:16.960
Hundred and seventy-five? That's it?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.206
The rest followed Max.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.405
Not near the numbers we need.

38:20.520 --> 38:21.885
- No.
- Hold it!

38:22.880 --> 38:24.325
Drop your guns.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.324
Whoa, hey.
They're with us.

38:27.400 --> 38:28.561
We know who you are.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.729
Last warning. Drop your guns.

38:34.720 --> 38:35.721
FOUR; All right.

38:47.640 --> 38:48.846
Easy.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.248
I'm Jack Kang.
I'm leadership here.

39:03.360 --> 39:04.850
Yeah, we know who you are.

39:04.920 --> 39:06.240
And we're not a threat to Candor.

39:06.600 --> 39:09.331
That might be your truth.
It's not necessarily mine.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.328
All I know for certain
is you're both wanted

39:12.440 --> 39:14.363
for criminal insurgency and conspiring

39:14.440 --> 39:16.283
in the attack on Abnegation.

39:19.480 --> 39:20.606
Those are lies.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.362
If you were Candor,
I would take you at your word.

39:25.040 --> 39:26.804
Unfortunately, given the circumstances,

39:26.880 --> 39:28.644
I'm obliged to hand you
over to the Council.

39:29.320 --> 39:30.685
You can make your case there.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.643
You might as well just kill us now.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.960
If Jeanine finds us,
we're not gonna live to stand trial.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.884
I doubt that very much.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.291
She would never supersede the Council.

39:38.440 --> 39:41.842
Sure about that?
Who's gonna stop her? You?

39:44.040 --> 39:46.042
Factional law must be upheld.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.049
All right, wait, wait, wait.

39:48.960 --> 39:50.246
Can I ask you one question?

39:51.880 --> 39:53.325
Can I ask you one question?

39:54.160 --> 39:55.924
Jeanine believes that Erudite
are most fit to govern

39:56.000 --> 39:57.809
because they are the smartest.

39:58.080 --> 40:00.960
Do you believe that Candor is most fit
to judge because you're so honest?

40:02.080 --> 40:04.731
I admit I do hold that belief.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.923
Then would you say that
a trial held here at Candor

40:07.000 --> 40:09.320
would be inherently more fair
than a trial held by Erudite?

40:09.840 --> 40:10.841
Hmm.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.685
The answer is yes.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.444
In my opinion, a Candor trial would have

40:18.560 --> 40:20.688
the greatest chance of
achieving true justice.

40:21.240 --> 40:22.844
So are you asking me to
petition the Council

40:22.920 --> 40:24.649
to grant Candor sole judiciary power?

40:24.720 --> 40:26.529
No. As part of Candor's initiation,

40:26.600 --> 40:28.011
you administer a truth serum.

40:28.840 --> 40:29.887
Correct?

40:32.200 --> 40:34.360
We don't typically discuss
such matters out of faction.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.686
That's a pretty evasive answer.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.000
Evasion is not dishonest.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.122
It's not exactly honesty either.

40:40.400 --> 40:43.085
Yes. We possess such a serum.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.566
Then use it on us.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.410
- Four.
- If we're guilty,

40:46.520 --> 40:48.363
we'll surrender to the Council. All right?

40:48.520 --> 40:52.127
If not, you've just saved two lives.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.611
And made some loyal allies.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.200
All right.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.880
But you should know
that the serum can be quite brutal.

40:58.120 --> 41:02.205
It was designed for Candor applicants
who are already predisposed to honesty.

41:02.560 --> 41:05.450
Not everyone finds it so easy
to share their secrets.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.006
Don't wanna do this.

41:08.080 --> 41:09.923
We have to.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.088
Neither of us have secrets worth dying for.

41:22.560 --> 41:23.891
May the truth set you free.

41:41.840 --> 41:43.126
Tobias Eaton,

41:46.920 --> 41:49.161
you are accused of conspiring
with your fellow Dauntless

41:49.240 --> 41:50.924
in the attack on Abnegation.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.370
Is this true?

41:55.360 --> 41:56.691
Conspiring, no.

41:57.920 --> 41:58.967
But I did attack.

41:59.960 --> 42:01.928
I was in a simulation controlled by Jeanine

42:02.160 --> 42:04.288
and the rest of the Dauntless
that she recruited.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.045
Tris found me.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.088
She managed to break me free
from the simulation,

42:10.160 --> 42:11.650
and then together we...

42:11.760 --> 42:13.808
Together we fought our way out.

42:18.800 --> 42:21.451
So you're saying
that Jeanine orchestrated this attack?

42:24.560 --> 42:25.800
Yes.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.130
One last thing.

42:32.120 --> 42:35.124
If you suspected that Jeanine
had corrupted Dauntless,

42:35.480 --> 42:37.005
why didn't you just leave?

42:39.160 --> 42:40.525
Why did you stay?

42:41.400 --> 42:42.920
I wanted to leave.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.482
But I fell in love with Tris Prior.

42:50.160 --> 42:51.810
And I couldn't leave her.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.164
Thank you for your candor.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.484
Thank you for your candor.

43:04.800 --> 43:07.007
Tobias Eaton,
this trial is concluded.

43:07.200 --> 43:10.443
And you are absolved of guilt
in the attack on Abnegation.

43:12.760 --> 43:14.250
Miss Prior, if you would.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.569
May the truth set you free.

43:42.200 --> 43:43.486
Tris Prior,

43:45.040 --> 43:47.611
Mr. Eaton said you managed
to free him from the sim.

43:50.440 --> 43:51.566
Yes.

43:52.400 --> 43:54.562
So you were never
under the simulation yourself?

43:56.160 --> 43:57.366
No.

43:58.400 --> 44:00.084
How is that possible?

44:01.560 --> 44:03.403
Because I'm Divergent.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.211
I see.

44:14.520 --> 44:17.330
So you never harmed
any of your fellow Dauntless

44:17.400 --> 44:18.526
or the Abnegation?

44:20.760 --> 44:21.966
I did.

44:25.880 --> 44:27.086
Both.

44:30.240 --> 44:31.241
Who?

44:34.080 --> 44:35.491
My mom.

44:37.440 --> 44:38.441
Um...

44:39.480 --> 44:41.562
I watched her die first.

44:42.600 --> 44:44.090
And then my dad.

44:44.320 --> 44:46.766
They were killed trying to save me.

44:48.400 --> 44:52.121
And... I...

44:54.960 --> 44:56.769
Miss Prior, the more you resist,

44:56.920 --> 44:58.570
the more painful the serum will be.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.241
Ow!

45:06.160 --> 45:07.241
My friend...

45:09.160 --> 45:10.764
I killed my friend.

45:11.760 --> 45:15.082
He was trying to shoot me. And I...

45:20.840 --> 45:22.922
I shot him first.

45:27.320 --> 45:28.845
What was his name?

45:30.120 --> 45:31.451
I can't.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.290
What was his name?

45:40.000 --> 45:41.126
Will.

45:44.280 --> 45:45.691
I killed Will.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.050
'Cause that's what happens

45:55.000 --> 45:57.970
to people when they get close to me.

46:06.680 --> 46:08.682
They get hurt or they die.

46:10.680 --> 46:12.682
I can't forgive myself.

46:16.520 --> 46:18.090
Thank you for your candor.

46:18.720 --> 46:20.404
Thank you for your candor.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.201
Tris.

46:38.680 --> 46:39.727
Tris.

46:42.200 --> 46:44.043
I'm sorry, all right?

46:45.520 --> 46:47.170
I told you that I didn't wanna do that.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.281
Hey...

47:00.360 --> 47:01.930
- Christina...
- Go.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.566
Go.

47:15.480 --> 47:17.847
<i>Abnegation sim complete.</i>

47:19.160 --> 47:21.128
<i>Dauntless sim initiating.</i>

47:24.440 --> 47:26.488
Ma'am, the Divergent's
vitals are dropping.

47:26.600 --> 47:28.602
If we don't pull her out of
the sim soon, we'll lose her.

47:28.680 --> 47:30.762
You'll stop when I say so.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.611
She's gonna do it.

47:42.800 --> 47:44.450
She's gonna pass the sim.

47:48.280 --> 47:50.851
<i>Dauntless sim failed.</i>

47:52.120 --> 47:54.885
Divergent Test Subject Six
is no longer viable.

47:57.960 --> 47:59.371
All right, shut it down.

48:01.960 --> 48:03.644
Wasting our time.

48:05.640 --> 48:09.884
I've been assuming that
all Divergents are the same.

48:12.720 --> 48:15.246
But some are much stronger than others.

48:17.400 --> 48:19.641
Assign all non-essential personnel

48:19.720 --> 48:20.881
to the Divergent detail.

48:21.640 --> 48:23.165
We need to look harder.

48:23.680 --> 48:25.648
We need to find that very special one.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.002
Where's your scary boyfriend?

48:51.360 --> 48:54.011
Probably off doing scary boyfriend things.

48:59.400 --> 49:00.731
Mind if I join you?

49:06.200 --> 49:07.725
I love heights.

49:09.400 --> 49:11.482
From up here,
it all just seems so much smaller,

49:11.560 --> 49:12.561
you know?

49:14.360 --> 49:16.522
I know it sounds crazy,

49:17.080 --> 49:20.801
but sometimes I think
I see lights out beyond the wall.

49:22.880 --> 49:27.169
I know they say
it's all just wasteland out there, but...

49:28.640 --> 49:30.847
We can't be the only ones left.

49:30.920 --> 49:32.081
Can we?

49:37.560 --> 49:38.561
Let's go!

49:39.240 --> 49:40.241
Closest weapons?

49:40.320 --> 49:41.401
Ground floor.

50:58.840 --> 51:00.808
Floor's clear. Movin' down.

51:29.080 --> 51:30.730
Mommy? Mommy?

51:30.840 --> 51:32.524
Shh.

51:33.680 --> 51:34.681
Shh.

51:34.760 --> 51:36.364
They hurt my mommy?

51:37.360 --> 51:38.771
Look, I got one, too.

51:39.920 --> 51:41.684
See? It's okay.

51:42.440 --> 51:44.522
It's just the thing that
made everybody go to sleep.

51:45.400 --> 51:46.845
Okay, I need you to do me a favor.

51:47.680 --> 51:49.489
I need you to go to the top
of those stairs up there.

51:49.560 --> 51:51.528
Don't come down until your
mommy comes to get you.

51:51.680 --> 51:53.682
- Don't come down?
- Don't come down.

51:53.760 --> 51:55.046
Can you do that?

51:56.520 --> 51:58.090
Be brave, okay?

51:58.880 --> 52:01.121
Okay. Go.

52:37.280 --> 52:38.406
Hey.

52:39.120 --> 52:40.770
Why are we the only ones awake?

52:42.320 --> 52:43.810
Because we're Divergents.

52:44.280 --> 52:46.487
Come on, I need your help.
We have to open this.

52:46.760 --> 52:48.250
Uriah, I need your help.

52:51.920 --> 52:52.921
Go.

52:54.480 --> 52:55.606
Hey!

52:56.600 --> 52:58.762
Look who decided to show up.

53:05.440 --> 53:07.169
It's really good to see you again.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.651
All right, folks.
Nothin' to be nervous about.

53:17.960 --> 53:19.962
Just a little routine inspection.

53:20.040 --> 53:21.883
Then we can all go back to our business.

53:24.040 --> 53:25.201
Hello.

53:29.880 --> 53:31.120
Divergent,

53:31.440 --> 53:32.805
<i>- 10%.</i>
- Hmm.

53:33.840 --> 53:34.966
Shit.

53:36.400 --> 53:37.811
You're almost normal.

53:38.800 --> 53:39.847
That's boring.

53:42.320 --> 53:44.004
That is not part of the mission.

53:44.520 --> 53:45.567
So what?

53:46.640 --> 53:49.166
Far as I'm concerned
the rest of them are still outlaws.

53:50.160 --> 53:51.889
Let's just wrap this up quickly.

53:52.160 --> 53:54.481
The others are gonna be awake soon.

54:05.920 --> 54:07.081
Hi, sweetie.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.491
I shouldn'ta...

54:10.400 --> 54:12.721
<i>Divergent, 40%.</i>

54:12.840 --> 54:14.330
I'm afraid it's not you, either.

54:16.040 --> 54:17.883
The lady said I shouldn'ta...

54:19.000 --> 54:21.526
The lady said I shouldn'ta come downstairs.

54:23.080 --> 54:25.082
Guess you shoulda listened.

54:35.440 --> 54:36.441
Enough.

54:36.760 --> 54:37.921
We still have to test her.

54:38.440 --> 54:39.441
Eric!

54:40.720 --> 54:43.041
Jeanine told us that
we have to test everyone.

54:50.440 --> 54:52.727
<i>Divergent, 100%.</i>

54:52.800 --> 54:54.131
I'll be damned.

54:54.360 --> 54:55.407
What?

54:55.560 --> 54:57.210
She's what we've been looking for.

54:57.480 --> 54:58.641
Bullshit.

55:03.400 --> 55:05.926
<i>Divergent, 100%.</i>

55:08.880 --> 55:11.724
Get her in a vehicle.
I'll alert Jeanine.

55:16.160 --> 55:19.243
If you think you got lucky, you're wrong.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.562
You're gonna wish I killed you.

55:36.240 --> 55:37.366
Drop it. Don't move.

55:37.440 --> 55:38.680
- Drop your weapon!
- Get down.

55:38.760 --> 55:40.560
- Let me see your hands.
- Right there!

55:49.960 --> 55:51.007
Hey.

55:53.840 --> 55:54.841
Thank you.

55:57.280 --> 55:59.282
It's lucky you got that gun, Four.

56:01.760 --> 56:04.604
Oh, we both know you were
never much without one.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.450
You think she's safe now?

56:38.400 --> 56:39.526
You're wrong.

56:40.760 --> 56:43.047
Jeanine's never gonna stop
searching for you.

56:46.120 --> 56:49.169
Why?
What does she want with her?

56:50.640 --> 56:51.641
Tell me.

56:52.280 --> 56:54.851
Look, all I know is she's
exactly what Jeanine needs.

56:55.160 --> 56:57.003
She's the perfect subject.

57:01.080 --> 57:02.525
Was that supposed to scare me?

57:04.360 --> 57:06.886
You're responsible for the
death of hundreds of people.

57:07.520 --> 57:09.170
You know the punishment for that.

57:09.400 --> 57:10.447
Listen...

57:11.880 --> 57:14.531
I've found a way to live with
the blood on my hands.

57:15.760 --> 57:17.000
But can you?

57:49.720 --> 57:51.051
Why won't they come out?

57:51.120 --> 57:53.043
All I know is it put me in a sleeping sim,

57:53.120 --> 57:54.451
and then I woke up to all
hell breaking loose.

57:54.560 --> 57:56.130
Hec! Don't play with it.

58:06.480 --> 58:08.164
You all know what this means.

58:10.160 --> 58:12.606
Thank you. For helping us.

58:12.960 --> 58:14.564
I wish I could do more.

58:15.560 --> 58:16.880
I had no idea Jeanine was capable

58:16.920 --> 58:17.921
of something like this.

58:19.960 --> 58:21.246
It's time we fight back.

58:21.320 --> 58:22.481
We don't have the numbers.

58:22.600 --> 58:26.082
We will. Once we get to Factionless.

58:28.560 --> 58:30.722
<i>Strict curfew until further notice.</i>

58:31.160 --> 58:32.844
You heard Eric.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.082
Jeanine's never gonna
stop coming after you.

58:35.160 --> 58:36.161
It's our only option.

58:42.960 --> 58:44.564
<i>Tris Prior.</i>

58:45.440 --> 58:48.922
Of course.
It had to be her.

58:50.440 --> 58:52.090
Is she still off the grid?

58:52.320 --> 58:55.244
Yeah. But I think I found a solution.

58:59.600 --> 59:01.443
It's Peter. Right?

59:01.640 --> 59:04.962
Yeah. And, Jeanine,
can I just say that it is truly an honor

59:05.040 --> 59:07.122
to finally meet you in person?

59:08.080 --> 59:09.650
Congratulations, Mother.

59:10.800 --> 59:12.040
You got your war.

59:12.960 --> 59:14.803
I know you wish there was another way.

59:16.080 --> 59:17.320
But there isn't.

59:19.960 --> 59:22.440
I'm the lesser of two evils. Is that it?

59:28.240 --> 59:29.651
You'd better be.

59:30.480 --> 59:31.561
<i>Tell me,</i>

59:32.280 --> 59:34.089
why did you surrender to Erudite?

59:36.120 --> 59:37.281
What do you want?

59:39.640 --> 59:41.688
I would like a position in your regime.

59:43.440 --> 59:45.249
Ideally, I would like a position

59:45.320 --> 59:46.760
with some advancement opportunities.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.128
I may be Dauntless,
but I'm not just a meathead.

59:52.440 --> 59:53.441
No offense, Max.

59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.364
Prove your worth to us.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.681
Then we can discuss your ambitions.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.204
Great. When do I start?

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.166
Let's talk about your friend Tris Prior.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.043
How do I flush her out?

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.806
<i>Simple.
The girl's a walking bleeding heart.</i>

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.042
<i>She was born Abnegation.
That's her weak spot.</i>

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.730
<i>You just have to know how to press it.</i>

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.604
Help! Come quick!

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.960
It's coming from up there.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.121
Christina!

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.725
Please, help!

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.560
Somebody do something!

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.723
- Look!
- On the ledge!

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:38.011
The traitor Tris Prior
must be surrendered to Erudite

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.563
or every day more deaths will follow.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.201
Go!

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.402
Hand over Tris Prior

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.406
or every day more deaths will follow.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.321
Hand over Tris Prior

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.210
or every day more deaths will follow.

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.481
Get down!

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.205
Hector! No!

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.402
Hand over Tris Prior

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.607
or every day

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.240
- more deaths will follow.
- Christina!

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.401
No!

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.604
Christina! Christina!

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.444
Tris, help me.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:28.721
Tris!

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.601
It's okay.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.087
We removed this from
the body of the suicide.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:11.167
Marlene. Her name was Marlene.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.090
I'm sorry. Marlene.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.166
It's a very sophisticated
sim serum injector.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.448
It also has a radio
transmitter in its head.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.091
How do we get them out?

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.926
I don't know.
This tech was built to defend itself.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.845
This tendril wraps around
the nearest major artery.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:34.926
Try to remove them and they kill the host.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.761
So what do we do?

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.524
Tori has to find a way
to neutralize the disks

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.766
before we do anything else.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.683
Or we could do the logical thing.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.444
And we hand her over.

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.204
Nobody knows about this alliance.

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.770
We have to protect that advantage.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.808
If we hand Tris over now,
might buy us some time.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.560
I think it's a good idea.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.080
- Get rid of her!
- Damn right.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.884
Except you'll have to go through me first.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.201
Me, too.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.805
And all of us.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.886
Hey! I ain't the one with
the time bomb in my arm.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.321
Yeah!

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.204
I know what you're thinking.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.769
But I'm not gonna let you do it.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.562
I can't let anyone else die because of me.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.122
No one else is gonna die because of you.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.448
Tori's gonna find a way
to disable the disks...

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.971
And if she doesn't?

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.246
Then... Then...

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:29.966
Then if she doesn't, we figure it out.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.201
Together.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.641
You know I'm just one person.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.771
I'm not worth it.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.089
No, you are worth it.
You are worth it to me.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.445
I love you.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.161
<i>...plays a critical
role in maintaining the social order.</i>

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:56.444
<i>But this harmony we've
achieved is now under attack.</i>

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.561
<i>This city may be safely
enclosed behind a vast</i> wall.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.205
<i>But make no mistake,</i>

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.923
<i>that wall alone does not
ensure our security.</i>

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:09.921
<i>It is up to us, every one of us,</i>

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:14.881
<i>to remain vigilant in identifying and isolating
any potential threat to our stability.</i>

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:19.605
<i>There are individuals hiding among us
who must be contained.</i>

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.722
<i>So permit me to address the objections</i>

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.246
<i>of my fellow faction leaders.</i>

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.729
<i>I am aware that there
have been some concerns</i>

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.768
<i>about the unavoidable raid on Candor.</i>

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.520
<i>So let me be clear.</i>

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:39.451
<i>The harboring of Divergents by any faction
cannot be tolerated.</i>

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.804
<i>Very soon, I will be presenting
what I believe to be no less than a mandate</i>

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.167
<i>from The Founders themselves.</i>

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.290
<i>And this will, I have no doubt,</i>

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.325
<i>validate the measures
I'm taking to keep the peace.</i>

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.001
<i>And provide the instructions
that will allow us</i>

01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.688
<i>to eradicate the Divergent
crisis, once and for all.</i>

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.085
Where are you going?

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:19.965
Tris left. She's gone.

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:23.850
What? When?

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:25.640
Last night.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:26.801
Wait.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.246
Tobias!

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:33.890
People look to you for leadership.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.609
You can't just abandon them.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:41.770
Tobias!

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:52.727
Wow.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.769
I have to admit,
I'm impressed.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.603
I mean, I knew that you were dumb,

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.808
but I didn't think that
you were dumb enough

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:05.885
to actually come down here
and turn yourself in.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.569
The killings have to stop.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.399
Well, that just goes to show that

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:17.363
you can take the girl outta Abnegation,

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:19.568
but you can't take
the Abnegation outta the girl.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.640
Let's go.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.921
Once a stiff, always a stiff, right?

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.279
What is this?

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.205
What is this?
This is the only reason why you're alive, Tris.

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:42.368
Man, I love knowing stuff that you don't.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.443
Need you to open up that box, Tris.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.402
The only way to open that box
is to pass the sims

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.164
of all five factions.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.961
But the only people that
have tried to do it so far

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.804
have died.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.881
Oops.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.560
I don't think I was
supposed to tell you that.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.961
Oh, well.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.845
No pressure.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.971
Remarkable.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.441
Chances of it being you, of all people.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.891
Nearly defies the laws of probability.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.009
As remarkable as the amount
of people you've managed

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.684
to murder.

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:33.210
Dark times call for extreme measures.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.770
You may find it hard to believe,

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:40.201
but I am serving the greater good.

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.481
Step up on the disk, please.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.727
Step up on the disk, please.

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.127
Ma'am?

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.600
Hmm?

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:25.961
Oh.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:29.563
Stop the suicides or
I swear I will shoot him.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.526
That's okay. You can kill him if you want.
We have plenty of guards.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.521
What?

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.801
I'm guessing you need me alive
for this to work.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.727
Right?

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.890
Right?

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.681
Beatrice.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.401
Caleb.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.567
Caleb.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.921
I...

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.923
Don't engage the subject.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.248
Conditions are already less than optimal.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.166
Oh, my God.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.280
If I do this, the suicides stop?

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.930
No. The suicides will continue

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.561
until you succeed.
And pass all five sims.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.447
Should be incentive enough.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.080
Good luck.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.411
Let's begin.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.200
<i>Initializing Dauntless sim.</i>

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.005
Mom.

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.285
Tris, help me!

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.204
What? No!

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.046
Tris?

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.201
Mom!

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.371
Her heart rate is rising.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.165
Keep her in play.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:16.681
Mom!

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.690
- Tris!
- I'm coming!

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.201
Mom!

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.361
I'm coming.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.891
Tris, help me!

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.086
Hold on.

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.841
Hold on!

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.321
Tris.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.208
<i>Dauntless sim complete.</i>

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.281
Mom.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.004
I miss you so much.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.725
Mmm. I know you do.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.690
But I'm still with you.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.724
You need to be strong now.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.525
Tell me you're gonna be strong.

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.281
I'm trying.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.609
You can do this.
I know you can.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:04.290
You're brave.
Braver than anyone.

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.923
I'm not brave, Mom.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.411
I pretend that I am.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:17.769
And I want people to think that I am.
But I'm not.

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.482
I'm really, really scared.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.964
That maybe we are actually
what's wrong in this world.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.726
Divergents.

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.360
I never wanted any of this.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.922
You and Dad and Caleb and then Four.

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:43.570
And I can't help but think
that if I was normal

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.004
we would all still be together.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:52.929
Mom, I don't wanna be Divergent anymore.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.331
I just wanna feel safe again.

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.722
<i>Candor sim complete.</i>

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:20.847
Four.

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.167
You're here. Yeah?

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.361
Yeah, I am.

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.051
You're here.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.322
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.485
Secure the hallway.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.362
All right. Let's get you outta here.

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.930
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.843
Stop. Let him go.

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.325
Wait, you're not gonna shoot me?

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.164
Once a stiff, always a stiff.

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:14.761
Go!

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.564
Four, how did you get past security?

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.961
You know me.
Scary boyfriend skills.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.407
What is it?

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:39.284
You weren't there.
You didn't even hear that.

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.849
Tris, we need to leave now, all right?

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.251
I'm sorry, Four.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.927
What?

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.287
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you that I was gonna go.

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:56.849
I wanted to say goodbye
and I just didn't know how.

01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:57.921
I didn't know how.

01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.811
What are you talking about?

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.843
So even though I didn't
get to say it in real life

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.409
at least I get to say it now.

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:12.801
Even if it is just in the sim.

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.405
Tris, we're not in a sim.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.408
Don't you think I'd know
if I was in a sim?

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:18.641
Four,

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.649
you're not in a sim.

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.685
You are the sim.

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.726
Wait, wait.

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.247
<i>Erudite sim complete.</i>

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.211
There's only Amity now.

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.120
She hasn't passed Abnegation yet.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.642
Yes, she has.
When she spared your life.

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.202
This girl is extraordinary.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:18.089
She's tested positive
for four factions in one day.

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.005
No one's gotten that far.

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.360
We've got a problem.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.768
She's crashing.
We have to rest her.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.764
Sure you're not letting familial attachment
cloud your judgment?

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.401
See for yourself.

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:48.086
Very well.

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.205
Detach the subject.

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:06.130
Good work, everyone.
We'll resume tomorrow.

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.202
You were never planning on
going back to Abnegation,

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:52.281
were you?

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.763
I had to do what I felt was right.

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.008
Our parents would be ashamed of you.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.725
Well, maybe not.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:07.008
I mean, I am willing to sacrifice you,

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.566
the only family I have left,
the only person I love,

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.927
in order to preserve
what's best for everyone else.

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:17.040
What's more selfless than that?

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.965
What does Jeanine think
is in that box, Caleb?

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.205
It's a message from The Founders.

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.890
But the box was to be opened

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.440
only if the Faction System broke down,

01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:38.041
which is why it requires
someone like you to open it.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.600
You are living proof
that the Divergent problem

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.682
has grown beyond all control.

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.647
Do you even hear
what you're saying right now?

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.401
No one thinks it's your fault
that you were born this way.

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:53.121
Jeanine murdered an entire faction, Caleb.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.043
That faction could no longer be trusted.

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.885
She killed our parents.

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.048
Our parents brought that on themselves.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.811
What are you talking about?

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.206
The box?

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:05.601
It was in their house.
They were the ones hiding it.

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:07.804
All of those lives could have been spared.

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.680
Seems we didn't know our parents
as well as we thought we did.

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.531
All right. Family reunion's over.
It's time to go.

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.164
I got a little surprise for you, Tris.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:33.607
Four?

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:34.721
Tris!

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.566
- Tris! Tris!
- Four! Four!

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:40.446
- Tris!
- Four! Four!

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.491
Stop! Four!

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:44.046
Four!

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.206
I gather your brother
explained to you how vital

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:56.681
the work you're doing here
is to the future of this city?

01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.120
Please, just let Four go.

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:01.924
If his well-being is of such concern

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.970
then you should focus on the task at hand.

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.166
Tell me, do you appreciate irony?

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.524
You tested positive for Erudite,

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.841
so you must have the intellectual capacity.

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.326
Irony?

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.926
For instance,
right now you're filled with hate.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.002
But you need to pass an Amity sim.

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.491
Then there are other ironies at work, too.

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.410
Such as the fact that
your cherished mother...

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.481
Don't.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.489
...who you so dauntlessly saved in the sim

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:36.600
is the reason you're
in this mess to begin with.

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:37.721
You're the reason I'm in this mess.

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:40.326
Then there's the most
poignant irony of all...

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.441
Stop.

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.170
...that Natalie Prior not only died

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.605
trying to protect the data that

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.762
- I now have in my possession.
- Because you stole it from her.

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:47.841
You killed her for it!

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:50.082
Data that she so selfishly withheld.

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:53.928
But her own daughter.
Her beloved Divergent Tris

01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.080
is going to be the
one to deliver it to me.

01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.121
I said stop!

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:00.283
Therefore, your mother's death,

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.882
just like your boyfriend's death,

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.651
will mean absolutely nothing.

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.888
Don't pull her out.

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:17.927
Not yet.

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:09.081
No.

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:10.841
No.

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:14.605
Bring her back!

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:18.845
Bring her back!

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.330
No!

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:24.845
Bring her back! Come on!

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:26.446
Come on.

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:27.681
Come on.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:31.841
Bring her back!

01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.127
Test Subject Seven is no longer viable.

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.522
I really thought you were the one.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:13.881
We'll just...

01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:20.323
We'll just have to resume our search.

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:37.528
Find solace in your faction, Caleb.

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.481
We're your family now.

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.769
Jeanine wanted me to show you this.

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.131
Hey, Four. Maybe do that thing you do?

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:09.327
Hey, Four, come on,
that was pretty good, right?

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:11.608
First, I swiped a paralytic
from the infirmary.

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:14.000
Then I shot her up when she was all
freakin' out about you.

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.569
I mean, I told these guys
I was pretty smart.

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:17.801
Guess they shoulda listened.

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.600
You're real.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.331
Yeah, I'm real.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:31.090
What are you doing here?

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.291
You die, I die.

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.607
Okay, guys, come on.

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:42.331
Let's go, seriously.
We can do that later.

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.884
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:49.641
Thank you, Peter.

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.240
Yeah, whatever.
Now we're even, stiff.

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.322
All right.
Come on, let's go.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:55.607
Before Jeanine realizes you're still alive.

01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:57.444
- No, no, no.
- What?

01:33:57.640 --> 01:33:58.880
The box.
We have to get the box.

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:01.048
What, are you kidding me?
Now's not the time for a souvenir, Tris.

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.485
Four, you have to listen to me.

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:03.766
It's not what Jeanine thinks it is.

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.840
I know it's not.
My mother would have destroyed it.

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:08.321
We have to get it.

01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:13.770
Peter, is there another way into the lab?

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:16.450
I mean, I'd have to go
into the control room

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:17.521
to disable all the doors.

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.840
Okay, good, then do that.

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:22.447
Okay. Right now?

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:23.561
Yeah.

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:25.802
You just chose our side,
whether you meant to or not.

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:27.962
If you wanna survive, make sure we do.

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.367
Let's go.

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:34.041
Fuck.

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.281
Ma'am, our current assessment

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:49.447
with other possible candidates.

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.010
Correct. Female.

01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.160
And we have the two males
introduced to you before?

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:05.531
No guns. It'll draw too much attention.

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:08.841
Hey.

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:09.921
Hold up.

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:20.847
<i>Access denied.</i>

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:22.001
Come on, come on.

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.241
<i>Access granted.</i>

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:51.681
All right, let's go.

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:53.967
Come on.

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.650
- Is that it?
- Yes.

01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:57.200
All right, grab it and let's go.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.403
<i>Security breach.
Security breach. Lockdown.</i>

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:04.846
What's going on?

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.890
What's going on? What is it?

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:09.961
There's been a breach in the sim room.

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.280
Get me a remote feed.

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.407
I wanna see who the hell is in there.

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.970
The cameras are down in the sector, too.

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.366
I'm sending guards there now. Let's go.

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:18.046
Bring up every cell. Now.

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:26.845
Show her.

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.202
Tori finally found a way
to get 'em out safely.

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.560
How many others?

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.531
Every last one.

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:37.651
Let's go.

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.210
South corridor, 40 yards down.

01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.520
Tris?

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.810
Tris, come on, we gotta move.

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.731
Tris, we have to move.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.281
I can't. I can't.

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.966
My mom died protecting
whatever's inside of this.

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:57.723
I have to open it for her
and I think I know how.

01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:58.801
Tris, if we don't leave now,

01:36:58.880 --> 01:36:59.927
we're not gonna get outta here.

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.963
I have to do this first.

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:03.451
Look, I know it doesn't make any sense,

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:05.090
but you have to trust me, please.

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.810
With my life, apparently.

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:15.367
<i>All security teams,

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:16.487

01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.361
Flank right.

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:22.645
Don't move!

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.410
<i>Initializing Amity Sim.</i>

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:35.965
Back again, are we?

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:39.322
You're an even bigger
fool than your mother.

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:46.608
Say whatever you want to me, Jeanine.

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.250
But I'm not gonna fight you.

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:51.849
How very Amity of you.

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.121
I mean it.

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.570
I'm not gonna fight you.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:58.086
Of course you're not.

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.964
You're gonna fight her.

01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:05.963
The one you really hate.

01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.361
What are you?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.843
I'm you, Tris.

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:48.009
I'm the real you.

01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:59.811
I'm not gonna fight you.

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.600
I'll make you fight me.

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:02.727
You're not me.

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:05.645
I am.
I'm what they see when they look at you.

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.202
You killed Will.
And your parents.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.731
You're deadly.

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.361
That's enough!

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:33.569
No one's gonna love you, Tris.

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.290
They're never even gonna miss you.

01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:38.001
This world will be better off without you.

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.242
One less Divergent ruining everything.

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.410
And no one will ever,

01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:46.728
ever forgive you for what you've done.

01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:48.925
You're wrong.

01:39:58.600 --> 01:39:59.931
Because I will.

01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.560
<i>Amity Sim complete.</i>

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.487
Wait!

01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:44.801
No! Stop!

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.083
<i>Initializing message.</i>

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:11.281
Hello.

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.288
<i>I come from outside the</i> wall.

01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:17.126
<i>Where we have all but destroyed each other.</i>

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.731
We designed your city as an experiment.

01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:24.009
We believe it is the only way

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:26.487
to recover the humanity we have lost.

01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:32.802
<i>And we created factions to ensure peace.</i>

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:35.968
But we believe there
will be those among you

01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.964
who will transcend these factions.

01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.410
These will be the Divergent.

01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:46.565
They are the true purpose
of this experiment.

01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:50.481
<i>They are vital to humanity's survival.</i>

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.370
<i>If you're watching this now,</i>

01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:56.289
<i>then at least one of you is proof</i>

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.681
<i>that our experiment has succeeded.</i>

01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:03.727
<i>The time has come for you
to emerge from your isolation</i>

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.330
and rejoin us.

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.650
We've allowed you to believe

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:10.405
that you're the last of us.
But you're not.

01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:13.403
Mankind waits for you

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:15.521
<i>with hope</i>

01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.571
<i>beyond the wall.</i>

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.401
You okay?

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.240
Yeah.

01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:33.568
Yeah.

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:53.368
You were wrong about us.

01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:00.122
We were never the problem.

01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.924
We're the solution.

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:16.811
Bury the box.

01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.402
- What?
- No one sees it.

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.121
Ever.

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:25.411
Kill them both.

01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:26.961
No!

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.445
Drop it! Now!

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:35.521
Don't move.

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:41.168
Down! Put your weapons down, now!

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.281
Drop them. Drop them.

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:43.641
Stay!

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:44.887
Put it down!

01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:46.450
Do not move.

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:51.446
Hello, Jeanine.

01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:54.601
Evelyn?

01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.371
Impressive.

01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.611
Think we're gonna like it here.

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.090
Do you honestly think the other factions

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.161
will stand for this?

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:04.650
Because you're so popular?

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:08.641
Get her out of here.

01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:13.690
When that message gets out,
it'll be the end.

01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:33.405
What message?

01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:41.569
You'll see. I'm gonna put it
on every monitor in the city.

01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:46.200
<i>We have separated you from the rest of us.</i>

01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:51.728
<i>And we created factions to ensure peace.</i>

01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:55.250
<i>The time has come</i>

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:58.045
<i>to emerge from your
isolation and rejoin us.</i>

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.130
<i>We've allowed you to believe</i>

01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:04.443
<i>that you're the last of us.
But you're not.</i>

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:06.804
<i>If you're watching this now,</i>

01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.564
<i>then at least one of you is proof</i>

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.728
<i>that our experiment has succeeded.</i>

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.561
<i>Mankind waits for you, with hope,</i>

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.729
<i>beyond the wall.</i>

01:45:57.960 --> 01:45:59.724
<i>These will be the Divergent.</i>

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:03.124
<i>They are the true purpose
of this experiment.</i>

01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:05.971
<i>They are vital to humanity's survival.</i>

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:07.761
You did it.

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:10.281
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.650
Everyone's staring at me.

01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:21.011
You changed everything.

01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:24.649
What now?

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:27.131
Only one way to find out.

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:30.121
You ready?

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.250
It's been over 200 years.

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:41.683
Who knows what's out there?

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:46.402
You'll never find out.
