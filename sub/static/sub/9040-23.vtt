WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.333
[laughter and yelling]

00:03.333 --> 00:04.967
- HEY, WOULD YOU GUYS
KNOCK IT OFF?

00:04.967 --> 00:06.467
YOU'RE KILLING ME HERE.

00:06.467 --> 00:08.733
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:08.733 --> 00:10.700
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:10.700 --> 00:11.967
IS THAT MY NEW LIPSTICK?

00:11.967 --> 00:13.633
YOU--GIVE ME THIS.

00:13.633 --> 00:17.033
ALL RIGHT, NOW LISTEN, YOU GO
UPSTAIRS AND WASH YOUR FACES.

00:17.033 --> 00:18.867
[all screaming]
HEY!

00:18.867 --> 00:22.567
HEY, WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE
THIS COWBOY PARTY ON SATURDAY.

00:22.567 --> 00:24.267
I'LL GET MY SCISSORS
AND CUT YOUR BIRTHDAY

00:24.267 --> 00:26.933
RIGHT OUT OF THE CALENDAR.

00:26.933 --> 00:28.133
[doorbell rings]

00:28.133 --> 00:30.567
OH, COME ON.

00:30.567 --> 00:34.967
MAYBE THIS IS
A BOURBON SALESMAN.

00:34.967 --> 00:38.333
MOM, HI, OH, MY GOSH.

00:38.333 --> 00:39.867
YOU KNOW YOU'RE EARLY?

00:39.867 --> 00:41.167
THE BIRTHDAY PARTY'S
NOT FOR TWO DAYS.

00:41.167 --> 00:42.500
- NO, I KNOW.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.433
I CAME TODAY BECAUSE
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

00:44.433 --> 00:46.300
- OH, OKAY, BUT WHY
DIDN'T YOU CALL, 'CAUSE--

00:46.300 --> 00:50.500
- YOUR FATHER
AND I HAVE SEPARATED.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.633
- HELLO, LOIS.

00:52.633 --> 00:54.133
- HI, MARIE.

00:54.133 --> 00:56.500
- I SAW YOU DRIVE UP.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.333
WAS I GIVEN THE WRONG DAY
FOR THE PARTY?

01:01.033 --> 01:03.933
WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:03.933 --> 01:06.833
DID--
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

01:06.833 --> 01:08.600
I THINK
I MISSED SOMETHING.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.700
- IT'S OKAY.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.200
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER,
OKAY, MARIE?

01:11.200 --> 01:13.033
- BUT I THINK
I MISSED SOMETHING.

01:13.033 --> 01:14.533
IF ANYBODY NEEDS
TO TALK TO ME,

01:14.533 --> 01:18.733
I'M JUST RIGHT ACROSS
THE STREET.

01:18.733 --> 01:21.700
I HAVE MARBLE CAKE!

01:25.567 --> 01:27.400
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:27.400 --> 01:29.133
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'VE SEPARATED?

01:29.133 --> 01:31.367
- WELL, I DON'T SUPPOSE
IT'S ANY SECRET

01:31.367 --> 01:34.133
THAT YOUR FATHER
AND I HAVE HAD OUR PROBLEMS.

01:34.133 --> 01:36.700
WE EVEN TRIED
THAT MARRIAGE COUNSELING

01:36.700 --> 01:38.300
THING IN NEW JERSEY.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.567
- OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.
ONE WEEK OF COUNSELING,

01:39.567 --> 01:40.967
AND THIS IS WHAT
YOU COME UP WITH?

01:40.967 --> 01:42.467
THIS IS HOW
YOU WORK THINGS OUT?

01:42.467 --> 01:45.733
- OH, HONEY, THIS CAN'T BE
A COMPLETE SURPRISE.

01:45.733 --> 01:48.500
YOU KNOW WE WERE NEVER
TRULY COMPATIBLE,

01:48.500 --> 01:51.633
AND NEW JERSEY ACTUALLY
MADE US SEE THAT.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.267
- OH, YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:53.267 --> 01:57.100
NEW JERSEY,
THE "JUST GIVE UP" STATE.

01:57.100 --> 01:59.333
- WELL, IT WAS 41 YEARS,

01:59.333 --> 02:01.533
SO YOU CAN'T SAY
WE DIDN'T GIVE IT A SHOT.

02:01.533 --> 02:05.567
NOW, PLEASE, DON'T BE UPSET,
BECAUSE I'M NOT, REALLY.

02:05.567 --> 02:09.267
I-I FEEL WONDERFUL
AND FREE.

02:09.267 --> 02:11.267
- YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

02:11.267 --> 02:12.767
AND WHAT ABOUT DAD?

02:12.767 --> 02:15.933
- WELL, HE'S FINE, TOO,
AND WE'LL STAY CLOSE.

02:15.933 --> 02:18.700
WE'LL PROBABLY BE
BETTER FRIENDS THAN BEFORE,

02:18.700 --> 02:21.233
AND, YOU KNOW, PAT AND CYRIL
WENT THROUGH THIS,

02:21.233 --> 02:23.433
AND THEY'RE
MUCH HAPPIER NOW.

02:23.433 --> 02:26.567
THEY SHARE CUSTODY
OF THE DOGS.

02:29.433 --> 02:31.433
- THIS IS--THIS IS
JUST LIKE YOU, YOU KNOW?

02:31.433 --> 02:33.333
YOUR HIP
AND TRENDY LIFESTYLE.

02:33.333 --> 02:35.033
IT'S CHIC
TO GET SEPARATED NOW,

02:35.033 --> 02:37.900
SO THAT'S WHAT YOU DO INSTEAD
OF PUTTING ANY EFFORT INTO--

02:37.900 --> 02:40.433
- OH, COME ON, DEBRA,
NOW, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

02:40.433 --> 02:43.467
IT'S BEEN NOTHING BUT EFFORT,
AND I HAVE TRIED.

02:43.467 --> 02:44.933
- YOU HAVE NEVER TRIED
ANYTHING FOR LONGER

02:44.933 --> 02:48.067
THAN IT WAS ON
A MAGAZINE COVER.

02:53.133 --> 02:54.700
[knocking]

02:58.333 --> 03:01.933
- MARIE?

03:01.933 --> 03:03.433
HELLO?

03:10.800 --> 03:13.633
- HIYA, LOIS.

03:13.633 --> 03:16.900
- I, UH--
I WAS LOOKING FOR MARIE.

03:16.900 --> 03:18.167
- OH, YEAH?

03:18.167 --> 03:21.300
FOR ME, JUST THE OPPOSITE.

03:23.367 --> 03:25.800
JUICE?

03:25.800 --> 03:27.700
- NO, THANK YOU.

03:27.700 --> 03:31.500
WOULD YOU MIND IF I JUST
HUNG OUT HERE FOR A BIT?

03:40.467 --> 03:44.133
- NOTHING'S GOING ON.

03:44.133 --> 03:45.567
- WHAT ARE YOU?

03:45.567 --> 03:48.100
PUT ON SOME CLOTHES
WITH COMPANY IN THE HOUSE.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.133
- WHAT COMPANY?
SHE'S FAMILY.

03:50.133 --> 03:53.233
HEY, THERE'S NOTHING HERE
SHE AIN'T SEEN ON WARREN.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.700
AM I WRONG?

03:55.700 --> 03:59.633
HEY, WHERE IS WARREN,
ABU DHABI OR SOMETHING?

03:59.633 --> 04:01.700
- COULD BE.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.833
THAT'S WHY I CAME OVER.

04:03.833 --> 04:06.167
I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT

04:06.167 --> 04:08.467
WARREN AND I
ARE SPLITTING UP.

04:08.467 --> 04:10.400
- [gasps]

04:12.800 --> 04:15.733
- I'LL PUT PANTS ON.

04:17.800 --> 04:21.133
- AWW, AWW.

04:21.133 --> 04:23.500
YOU POOR DEAR.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.633
- NO, NO, IT'S OKAY, MARIE.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.000
IT'S OKAY.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.567
- HE'S LEAVING YOU?

04:28.567 --> 04:30.033
- NO.

04:30.033 --> 04:32.100
IT'S COMPLETELY MUTUAL.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.700
WE'RE BOTH QUITE HAPPY,
HONESTLY.

04:34.700 --> 04:37.167
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND
WITH ME.

04:37.167 --> 04:40.800
YOU CAN TELL ME
ALL THE AWFUL DETAILS.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.467
PLEASE.

04:42.467 --> 04:44.467
NO, NOT THOSE PANTS.
THEY GO TO GOODWILL.

04:44.467 --> 04:46.333
- HEY, I LOVE THESE PANTS.

04:46.333 --> 04:49.067
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU
TO GIVE THEM TO GOODWILL?

04:49.067 --> 04:51.833
- THERE ARE HOLES IN THE SEAT.
YOU'VE WORN THROUGH THEM.

04:51.833 --> 04:55.333
- THEN YOU CAN'T GIVE THEM
TO GOODWILL; THAT'S BAD WILL.

04:55.333 --> 04:56.767
- THERE ARE OTHER PANTS
IN THE DRYER.

04:56.767 --> 04:59.267
PUT ON ONE OF THOSE.
- NO. THESE ARE THE PANTS.

04:59.267 --> 05:01.567
- NO, YOU ARE NOT WEARING
THOSE PANTS, FRANK.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.033
YOU'RE JUST LIKE
AN ANIMAL!

05:03.033 --> 05:05.567
- ANIMALS DON'T EVEN
LIKE PANTS!

05:05.567 --> 05:06.767
[pants rip]

05:06.767 --> 05:08.033
YOU DID THAT ON PURPOSE!

05:08.033 --> 05:11.167
- OH, I DID NOT!
- YOU'RE THE ANIMAL!

05:16.033 --> 05:18.500
- GO ON, DEAR.

05:20.067 --> 05:22.333
- UH, WELL, IT'S--

05:22.333 --> 05:24.200
IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.700
IT'S BEEN OVER 40 YEARS.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.133
WE NEEDED A CHANGE.

05:28.133 --> 05:30.767
- YOU DON'T SEEM
VERY UPSET.

05:30.767 --> 05:34.133
- ACTUALLY, I'M MORE UPSET
AND SURPRISED

05:34.133 --> 05:36.567
THAT DEBRA SEEMED SO UPSET.

05:36.567 --> 05:40.633
- WELL, I MUST SAY, I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND DEBRA HERE.

05:40.633 --> 05:44.767
I MEAN, I-I WAS BROUGHT UP
TO CONSIDER IT A SIN TO--

05:44.767 --> 05:47.400
[whispering]
DIVORCE.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.367
AND HERE YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT IT SO CASUALLY.

05:50.367 --> 05:53.733
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
AND WARREN BEEN SEPARATED?

05:53.733 --> 05:57.067
- ABOUT TWO WEEKS.

05:57.067 --> 06:00.200
- WHAT'S IT LIKE?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.767
- HEY, CHEESE DOODLE.

06:09.800 --> 06:13.767
OH, I ORDERED A MOON BOUNCE
FOR THE KIDS' PARTY SATURDAY.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.000
IT'S A CORRAL.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.400
IT GOES WITH
YOUR WHOLE COWBOY THEME.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.467
THEY SAID YOU GOT TO BE UNDER
80 POUNDS TO JUMP IN THERE,

06:19.467 --> 06:22.600
BUT SCREW THAT GUY;
I'M GOING IN.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.800
- UM, LISTEN, RAY.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.567
- WHAT?

06:32.567 --> 06:35.000
- I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.133
- YEAH?

06:37.133 --> 06:40.533
- IT'S PRETTY BIG.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.167
- OH, BOY.

06:42.167 --> 06:45.300
- YEAH.
[sighs]

06:49.200 --> 06:51.367
MY PARENTS
HAVE SEPARATED.

06:51.367 --> 06:55.633
THEY'RE ON THE PATH
TO DIVORCE.

06:55.633 --> 06:57.267
- [chuckles]

06:57.267 --> 06:59.433
- YOU LAUGH? YOU LAUGH?
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

06:59.433 --> 07:02.100
NO, IT WAS JUST--IT'S ONE
OF THOSE MOMENTS, YOU KNOW?

07:02.100 --> 07:03.900
IT'S TOO SERIOUS
OR SOMETHING.

07:03.900 --> 07:07.133
JUST--I WASN'T READY
FOR IT.

07:07.133 --> 07:10.267
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
NO, ALL RIGHT--

07:24.000 --> 07:26.700
THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY HERE.
THIS IS AWFUL; IT'S AWFUL.

07:26.700 --> 07:29.200
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?
IT'S THE WAY THAT YOU SAID IT.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.500
"THEY'RE ON THE PATH
TO DIVORCE."

07:31.500 --> 07:33.167
I'M NOT SMILING.
I DIDN'T SMILE.

07:33.167 --> 07:34.633
I'M NOT SMILING.

07:34.633 --> 07:36.433
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?
IT'S THE IMAGE I HAVE.

07:36.433 --> 07:38.200
I PICTURED THAT THERE WAS
A PATH IN THE FOREST

07:38.200 --> 07:39.600
WITH, LIKE, ONE OF THOSE
WOODEN SIGNS,

07:39.600 --> 07:42.633
"DIVORCE THIS WAY,"
AND I DON'T KNOW, WHAT,

07:42.633 --> 07:46.233
LIKE, "THREE LITTLE PIGS
THIS WAY."

07:46.233 --> 07:47.867
AND THEN YOUR FACE
WHEN YOU SAID IT,

07:47.867 --> 07:50.267
IT WAS JUST A LITTLE SERIOUS,
THAT'S ALL.

07:50.267 --> 07:51.767
[snickering]
NO!

07:51.767 --> 07:54.200
GOD, I THINK I HAD
TOO MUCH FUN AT WORK TODAY.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.833
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

07:55.833 --> 07:58.633
THE VENDING MACHINE--THE DOOR
TO THE VENDING MACHINE WAS--

07:58.633 --> 08:01.167
IT WAS BROKEN, SEE?

08:01.167 --> 08:03.800
FREE CANDY.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.600
THESE ARE MY FAVORITES--

08:06.600 --> 08:08.733
TWIX.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.233
[sighs]

09:17.600 --> 09:20.933
HEY.

09:20.933 --> 09:23.233
HUNGRY?

09:23.233 --> 09:25.233
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

09:25.233 --> 09:28.367
I GOT A LITTLE
CANDY LEFT UPSTAIRS.

09:39.333 --> 09:42.467
THAT'S OKAY.
I GOT MY CANDY.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.033
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR PARENTS?

09:48.033 --> 09:51.367
- WHY, YOU WANT ANOTHER
GOOD LAUGH?

09:51.367 --> 09:54.167
- I DIDN'T LAUGH.
I'M SORRY.

09:54.167 --> 09:55.400
I-I'M SORRY. COME ON.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.633
I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS.

09:57.633 --> 10:00.100
IT'S VERY BAD.

10:04.467 --> 10:05.800
LISTEN, I'M SORRY.
ALL RIGHT.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.667
WE HAVE TO--
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

10:07.667 --> 10:10.267
I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS WITH YOU.

10:10.267 --> 10:13.133
COME ON.
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS.

10:13.133 --> 10:16.367
[exhales]
SO YOUR PARENTS.

10:16.367 --> 10:20.167
BOY.

10:20.167 --> 10:21.400
- GO AHEAD.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.933
- WELL, I DON'T--
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

10:23.933 --> 10:26.967
I'M SORRY.

10:26.967 --> 10:29.667
BUT, I MEAN,
I HAVE TO SAY THIS.

10:29.667 --> 10:32.467
I THINK EVERYBODY COULD'VE
SEEN THIS COMING, RIGHT?

10:32.467 --> 10:36.233
I MEAN, REMEMBER THANKSGIVING,
HOW THEY YELLED?

10:36.233 --> 10:38.067
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

10:38.067 --> 10:41.633
I HAD A HARD TIME
FINISHING MY PIE.

10:41.633 --> 10:44.700
- I KNOW THEY HAD PROBLEMS,
RAY.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.267
- OKAY, SO THEN WHY ARE YOU
SO SURPRISED--

10:46.267 --> 10:47.767
- BECAUSE THEY'RE MY PARENTS.

10:47.767 --> 10:49.400
THEY'RE SPLITTING UP.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.667
WHAT I CAN'T BELIEVE
IS THAT

10:50.667 --> 10:51.967
THEY'RE THE ONES
GETTING A DIVORCE.

10:51.967 --> 10:55.967
IT SHOULD BE YOUR PARENTS.

10:55.967 --> 10:59.467
- WOW.

10:59.467 --> 11:01.433
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A PARTICULARLY NICE

11:01.433 --> 11:03.333
THING TO SAY.
- I'M SORRY.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.033
- I THINK SOMEONE
IS AWFULLY COMPETITIVE.

11:05.033 --> 11:07.933
- ALL RIGHT,
I'M SORRY, RAY.

11:07.933 --> 11:09.467
- NO, THAT'S FINE.

11:09.467 --> 11:11.500
SAY WHAT YOU WANT
ABOUT MY PARENTS.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.233
YOU USUALLY DO.

11:14.233 --> 11:16.600
BUT I WILL SAY THIS.

11:16.600 --> 11:20.267
MAYBE--MAYBE YOUR PARENTS
ARE SPLITTING UP

11:20.267 --> 11:24.033
BECAUSE THEY KEPT EVERYTHING
INSIDE FOR SO LONG

11:24.033 --> 11:27.233
THAT THEY FINALLY
JUST EXPLODED--

11:27.233 --> 11:28.967
LIKE WHEN YOU PUT
A PUDDING CUP

11:28.967 --> 11:33.367
IN THE MICROWAVE...

11:33.367 --> 11:36.500
WHICH WAS NOT ME,
BY THE WAY.

11:39.267 --> 11:41.333
- SO THIS DOESN'T
WORRY YOU?

11:41.333 --> 11:43.500
- WHAT?

11:43.500 --> 11:45.067
- WHAT ABOUT US?

11:45.067 --> 11:47.533
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:47.533 --> 11:49.633
- WHAT IF WE'RE HEADED
THAT WAY?

11:49.633 --> 11:53.833
I-I KEEP A LOT
OF STUFF INSIDE TOO.

11:53.833 --> 11:56.300
- NO, YOU DON'T.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.900
I DROP A SOCK
ON THE FLOOR,

11:57.900 --> 12:01.033
YOU SCREAM
LIKE A HORROR MOVIE.

12:05.300 --> 12:09.233
- THERE'S PLENTY MORE
I KEEP INSIDE, BELIEVE ME.

12:09.233 --> 12:12.367
- THERE CAN'T BE
A LOT LEFT IN THERE.

12:15.033 --> 12:16.667
- I HATE MY MOTHER.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.133
- OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

12:18.133 --> 12:19.567
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS
IS YOUR MOTHER'S FAULT?

12:19.567 --> 12:21.833
- OH, IT'S HER FAULT.
SHE'S SO--

12:21.833 --> 12:23.333
[sighs]

12:23.333 --> 12:25.533
WHY IS SHE DOING THIS?

12:25.533 --> 12:28.567
I MEAN, MY PARENTS
BEING TOGETHER--

12:28.567 --> 12:32.333
I MEAN, I HAVE COUNTED
ON THAT MY WHOLE LIFE.

12:32.333 --> 12:33.967
THROUGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE

12:33.967 --> 12:35.600
AND THEN STRUGGLING
AFTER COLLEGE,

12:35.600 --> 12:37.100
AND, YOU KNOW,
WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW

12:37.100 --> 12:38.700
WHAT I WAS DOING
OR WHERE I WAS GOING,

12:38.700 --> 12:41.133
AT LEAST I HAD--

12:41.133 --> 12:43.900
THEIR MARRIAGE
WAS LIKE A ROCK,

12:43.900 --> 12:46.967
THE ONE SOLID ROCK
FOR ME.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.000
- WELL--

12:49.000 --> 12:53.300
I MEAN, MAYBE IT WAS MORE LIKE
A STONE, ALL RIGHT?

12:53.300 --> 12:56.433
AND NOW IT HAS PASSED.

13:01.967 --> 13:03.400
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.733
- WHAT DID I DO?
- THAT'S--YOU KNOW, JUST ENOUGH.

13:04.733 --> 13:06.367
YOU CAN'T HAVE
A REAL CONVERSATION.

13:06.367 --> 13:07.833
YOU GOT TO BE FUNNY.
IDIOT.

13:07.833 --> 13:10.600
- IT WASN'T THAT FUNNY.
HEY, NO, COME ON, LOOK.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.367
I'M TRYING TO BE
UNDERSTANDING HERE, OKAY?

13:12.367 --> 13:14.433
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO SAID IDIOT,
ALL RIGHT?

13:14.433 --> 13:18.633
BUT I'M WILLING TO OVERLOOK IT
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND.

13:18.633 --> 13:21.767
YOU'RE THE CHILD
OF A BROKEN HOME.

13:31.267 --> 13:34.400
[children yelling]

13:35.867 --> 13:37.867
- OH, HI.

13:37.867 --> 13:41.833
- HI.

13:41.833 --> 13:44.667
- ALLY'S KERCHIEF TORE.

13:44.667 --> 13:46.867
- YEAH?

13:46.867 --> 13:48.600
- WELL,
SHE NEEDS ANOTHER ONE

13:48.600 --> 13:52.833
TO GO WITH HER
COWGIRL ENSEMBLE.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.767
- OKAY, I'LL GET IT.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.533
- DEBRA, WAIT.

13:56.533 --> 13:57.333
- WHAT?

13:57.333 --> 13:58.767
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

13:58.767 --> 14:02.367
I WAS JUST HOPING THAT
MAYBE YOU COULD'VE TRIED

14:02.367 --> 14:03.867
TO COME TO TERMS
WITH THE SITUATION

14:03.867 --> 14:05.433
OVER THE LAST
COUPLE OF DAYS.

14:05.433 --> 14:08.733
- NO, I'M FINE, MOM, BUT THANKS
FOR THE COUPLE OF DAYS

14:08.733 --> 14:11.567
TO COME TO TERMS
WITH IT.

14:11.567 --> 14:13.700
I GOT TO GET
THAT KERCHIEF.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.433
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

14:17.433 --> 14:20.033
- OKAY--

14:20.033 --> 14:22.033
COME ON.

14:22.033 --> 14:23.267
WE SAID IT BEFORE.

14:23.267 --> 14:24.900
I'M THE BAD GUY.
- YOU SAID THAT.

14:24.900 --> 14:26.667
I DID NOT AGREE
TO THAT.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.200
- WELL, THERE CAN'T BE
TWO BAD GUYS, OKAY?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.667
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

14:29.667 --> 14:31.600
- LOOK, I WANT TO BE
THE BAD GUY, RAYMOND, OKAY?

14:31.600 --> 14:35.733
I'M ALWAYS THE GOOD GUY.
I'M A COP.

14:35.733 --> 14:38.100
IT'S MONOTONOUS.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.467
LISTEN,
I BOUGHT THE MUSTACHE.

14:40.467 --> 14:42.067
- YEAH, WELL,
IT'S MY KIDS' PARTY, OKAY?

14:42.067 --> 14:43.267
AND THEY ALL HATE
THE GOOD GUY.

14:43.267 --> 14:47.000
- SO YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE HATE.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.567
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:48.567 --> 14:51.400
- OW!

14:51.400 --> 14:53.700
- IT'S ROTTEN RAYMOND!

14:56.633 --> 14:58.733
- HE'S SO FUNNY.

14:58.733 --> 15:01.667
- YEAH, HE'S A PIP.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.500
LISTEN, I-I WAS SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT YOU AND WARREN.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.100
- THANK YOU.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.400
- I'VE BEEN THERE.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.300
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.133
WHAT WAS YOUR
WIFE'S NAME AGAIN?

15:19.133 --> 15:21.033
- JOANNE.

15:21.033 --> 15:24.833
SHE WAS ACTUALLY
QUITE HORRIBLE.

15:24.833 --> 15:26.967
- RIGHT. I REMEMBER.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.600
- HEY, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

15:28.600 --> 15:32.133
IT GETS BETTER
AS TIME PASSES, YOU KNOW?

15:32.133 --> 15:34.733
- THANK YOU, ROBERT.

15:34.733 --> 15:38.800
ACTUALLY, WE'RE PRETTY
OKAY WITH IT NOW.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.100
- YEAH, SO WAS JOANNE.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.700
SHE HAD A PARTY.

15:44.700 --> 15:45.733
- OH?

15:45.733 --> 15:48.500
- AT HER OLD STRIP CLUB.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.800
ALL HER FRIENDS
WERE THERE,

15:50.800 --> 15:54.733
SATIN, BUBBLES, LICK-LICK.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.267
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

16:11.033 --> 16:15.167
- I WOULD SAY SHE'S THE ONE
THAT MADE THE MISTAKE.

16:16.900 --> 16:20.033
- THANK YOU.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.800
UH, LISTEN--

16:31.800 --> 16:33.033
- OH, NO, NO.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.867
SEE, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE CONSOLING.

16:34.867 --> 16:37.000
- GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
- NO, NO, I DIDN'T MEAN--

16:37.000 --> 16:40.133
- GOOD LUCK TO YOU!

16:41.333 --> 16:44.467
- I'M SORRY.
HE REALLY IS CRAZY.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.200
- OH, DAMN IT.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.000
STUPID DAMN
FRIGGIN' THING.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.700
- DEBRA?

16:54.933 --> 16:59.567
YOUR MOM SAID
YOU WERE UP HERE.

16:59.567 --> 17:02.033
- HI, DAD.

17:02.933 --> 17:07.200
[crying]

17:07.200 --> 17:11.100
I CAN'T FIND A KERCHIEF.

17:18.167 --> 17:21.233
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:21.233 --> 17:22.400
- WELL,
THE INVITATION SAID

17:22.400 --> 17:24.067
"ROUND 'EM UP"
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

17:24.067 --> 17:27.067
IT PROMISED
A ROOTIN' TOOTIN' TIME.

17:27.067 --> 17:29.867
- I'M SO SORRY, DAD.

17:29.867 --> 17:31.567
- YEAH, ME TOO.

17:31.567 --> 17:33.733
- I'M SORRY
SHE'S DOING THIS TO YOU.

17:33.733 --> 17:34.967
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:34.967 --> 17:37.800
- I KNOW HOW SHE IS.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.467
- UH--

17:41.467 --> 17:43.767
HERE. SIT DOWN.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.167
THIS IS NOT
YOUR MOTHER'S FAULT.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.733
- DON'T YOU DEFEND HER.
- LISTEN TO ME.

17:49.733 --> 17:51.133
[exhales]

17:51.133 --> 17:53.567
WE HAVE BOTH BEEN UNHAPPY
FOR SOME TIME NOW.

17:53.567 --> 17:55.300
YOU KNOW THAT.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.700
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO AT LEAST
TRIES TO MAKE AN EFFORT,

17:57.700 --> 18:00.167
LIKE WANTING TO GO
TO THAT MARRIAGE COUNSELING.

18:00.167 --> 18:01.533
- CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

18:01.533 --> 18:03.267
I NEVER REALLY WANTED
TO GO TO NEW JERSEY.

18:03.267 --> 18:05.967
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
I PICKED THAT PLACE?

18:05.967 --> 18:07.367
BECAUSE I WAS
LOOKING FORWARD

18:07.367 --> 18:11.967
TO HOW MUCH YOUR MOTHER
WOULD HATE IT.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.467
WELL, SHE LOVED IT,

18:13.467 --> 18:16.967
AND I WAS THE ONE BORED
OUT OF MY FREAKIN' SKULL.

18:16.967 --> 18:19.267
THOSE WORKSHOPS.

18:19.267 --> 18:23.367
"POLISHING
YOUR SOUL MATE'S SOUL."

18:23.367 --> 18:26.867
SO, YOU REALLY MUSTN'T
BLAME YOUR MOTHER, HONEY.

18:26.867 --> 18:31.900
I'M THE ONE
WHO ACTUALLY SAID IT WAS OVER.

18:31.900 --> 18:33.033
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

18:33.033 --> 18:35.167
- IT'S TRUE.

18:35.167 --> 18:38.600
- AND WHAT DID SHE SAY?

18:38.600 --> 18:40.533
- WELL, SHE KNEW.

18:40.533 --> 18:43.467
WE BOTH KNEW.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.000
DON'T CRY, HONEY.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.600
- I CAN'T HELP IT.
[sniffling]

18:50.600 --> 18:53.033
I MEAN, WHY THE HELL
DO YOU TAKE VOWS

18:53.033 --> 18:55.700
IF--IF THEY DON'T
MEAN ANYTHING?

18:55.700 --> 18:57.167
- WE MEANT IT THEN.

18:57.167 --> 19:01.333
WE MEANT IT
WHEN YOU WERE KIDS.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.300
BUT WHEN YOUR SISTER,

19:03.300 --> 19:05.133
AND THEN YOU,
WENT OFF TO COLLEGE,

19:05.133 --> 19:07.300
IT KEPT GETTING HARDER.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.200
- WELL,
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE KISSING

19:09.200 --> 19:10.667
AND THE TRAVELING TOGETHER

19:10.667 --> 19:13.900
AND THE "POOKUMS ONE AND TWO"
LICENSE PLATES?

19:13.900 --> 19:16.867
WHAT WAS THAT?

19:16.867 --> 19:19.133
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

19:19.133 --> 19:22.167
I GUESS, BY THE END,

19:22.167 --> 19:27.200
MOST OF THAT WAS JUST...
A SHOW,

19:27.200 --> 19:29.900
AND WE HAD ENOUGH.

19:29.900 --> 19:33.000
WE BOTH HAD ENOUGH.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.400
IT'S NOT LIKE
RAY'S PARENTS.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.967
- WHAT?

19:42.967 --> 19:45.500
- THEY SEEM TO HAVE
THE SECRET.

19:45.500 --> 19:49.800
- WHAT?

19:49.800 --> 19:51.233
- THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.233
IT'S NOT A FACADE FOR THEM.

19:53.233 --> 19:58.100
- BUT THEY'RE MANIACS.

19:58.100 --> 20:01.400
- YES, BUT THEY'RE HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.433
EVERYTHING IS OUT
IN THE OPEN WITH THEM.

20:04.433 --> 20:07.500
"EGGS, MARIE,
AND HOLD THE CHATTER."

20:07.500 --> 20:10.233
I LOVE THAT.

20:10.233 --> 20:12.400
GOD, I'LL TELL YOU,

20:12.400 --> 20:15.533
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO OUGHT
TO BE GIVING THE SEMINAR.

20:42.100 --> 20:45.267
- HOWDY.

20:45.267 --> 20:47.933
- COULD YOU TAKE THAT OFF,
PLEASE?

20:47.933 --> 20:50.067
- YES, MA'AM.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.667
FEELING ANY BETTER?

21:04.667 --> 21:08.767
- I GUESS.

21:08.767 --> 21:12.600
- I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.367
- I KNOW.

21:15.367 --> 21:19.300
- BUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S NOT US.

21:20.767 --> 21:22.300
'CAUSE I-I THINK

21:22.300 --> 21:25.433
WE KIND OF GET EVERYTHING
OUT IN THE OPEN.

21:32.733 --> 21:34.667
- TIGHTER.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.467
TIGHTER.

21:46.567 --> 21:49.700
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO PUT ON THE MUSTACHE?
