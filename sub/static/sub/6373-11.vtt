Mr. Suarez, You're under arrest.

00:06.506 --> 00:09.805
We're having a party on 25
with Human Resources, if you're free.

00:09.876 --> 00:13.209
- Well, I'd love to go, Henry, but...
- Well, you have a boyfriend.

00:13.279 --> 00:14.268
Yeah, I do.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.315
Marc, can I have some privacy, please?

00:16.383 --> 00:17.907
Come on, Willie.

00:17.984 --> 00:20.544
We don't have any secrets. Not anymore.

00:21.287 --> 00:25.519
Come work for my magazine. You'll have
your own assistant within a year.

00:25.592 --> 00:28.823
She told me about the job offer.
I would never stand in your way.

00:28.895 --> 00:32.262
You didn't grow up
wanting to be my assistant.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.201
A list?

00:47.280 --> 00:49.271
You know, "naughty or nice."

00:49.349 --> 00:51.909
Most people here
fit into the first category.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.317
But you, Betty...

00:54.387 --> 00:56.082
...you're always nice.

00:57.590 --> 01:00.650
No, it's just Daniel's expense report.
I'm done. Here.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.099
No way.

01:09.169 --> 01:13.401
$8,479? That's the exact number
of stars visible from Earth...

01:14.240 --> 01:16.765
...on an ideal night.
- How do you...?

01:16.843 --> 01:18.037
Just something I know.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.404
Hey...

01:24.150 --> 01:27.381
...is that mistletoe?
- No, it's just holly.

01:35.995 --> 01:38.327
Wow.

01:38.398 --> 01:40.764
You know what, Betty?

I'm gonna miss you.

02:21.741 --> 02:23.641
It's been an amazing three weeks.

02:24.344 --> 02:27.905
I know. It's all been sort of intense.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.973
Actually, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.952
I think we should
take a breather while I'm gone.

02:35.021 --> 02:39.082
A breather?
What are you talking about?

02:39.159 --> 02:42.686
A little time to cool off... apart.

02:42.762 --> 02:44.992
Just to make sure all this is real.

02:45.064 --> 02:47.965
Oh, I know it's real, Sofia.

02:48.034 --> 02:50.161
- I love you.
- Oh, Daniel.

02:50.236 --> 02:52.329
What do you know from love?

02:53.773 --> 02:56.139
Your heart's racing,

02:56.209 --> 02:58.575
palms sweating,

02:58.645 --> 03:00.840
you can barely breathe
when you see me?

03:00.914 --> 03:03.212
Actually, yeah. All of that.

03:03.283 --> 03:05.251
Well, that's not love.

03:05.318 --> 03:09.618
That is hormones.
Infatuation. Good sex.

03:09.689 --> 03:13.455
But this isn't just
about sex, Sofia.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.586
Although it has been
pretty good. Right?

03:16.896 --> 03:20.388
- Daniel...
- What? I can see a life with you.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.297
OK.

03:23.403 --> 03:25.530
If this is all real, prove it.

03:25.772 --> 03:28.434
Why don't you see other women
while I'm gone,

03:28.508 --> 03:30.373
I'm giving you the green light.

03:31.611 --> 03:32.737
I'm serious.

03:32.812 --> 03:37.272
And if you don't get sweaty palms
and all that when you're with them,

03:37.350 --> 03:38.977
then maybe this is real.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.384
I am not going to cheat on you

03:41.454 --> 03:44.651
just to prove I love you,
that's... I mean, that's crazy.

03:47.694 --> 03:50.288
Don't think about it as cheating.

03:51.264 --> 03:53.994
Think about it as proving your theory.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.970
See, I need you to convince me

03:59.038 --> 04:02.769
that there's only one... woman...

04:02.842 --> 04:05.208
...that you feel this way about.

04:05.278 --> 04:06.905
Me.

04:09.048 --> 04:12.313
It was just a dream, girl.
Don't get too freaked out by it.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.285
But I barely even know Henry!

04:14.354 --> 04:16.413
I don't get it.
I have a boyfriend.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.889
Did I ever tell you
about my Jose Mendoza dreams?

04:18.958 --> 04:21.358
Ew. That pimply guy
who owns the bakery on 85th?

04:21.427 --> 04:24.487
He was really into Herbalux
digestive tonics. Don't judge.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.555
Anyway, a month ago I had this dream.

04:26.633 --> 04:29.500
We were going at it
in this big bowl of cake batter...

04:29.569 --> 04:31.833
Never mind, that's not the point.
Anyway,

04:31.904 --> 04:35.499
the point is, do you see us dating now?
No, of course not. Know why?

04:35.575 --> 04:37.702
It was a dream,
they don't mean anything.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.712
Henry isn't Jose.
He's... it's different.

04:40.780 --> 04:44.147
And well, we did go on a date once.
Well, lunch.

04:44.217 --> 04:47.948
Stop. Go to the Pro Buy party with
Walter tonight. Just forget about it.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.682
Hilda, I kissed Henry!

04:49.756 --> 04:54.090
In your dream. As long as you don't
actually do anything, it's harmless.

04:54.160 --> 04:58.119
Betty, we're all tempted sometimes,
right? Just avoid this Henry guy,

04:58.197 --> 05:01.598
and everything will be fine.
Justin! Honey, let's go!

05:03.970 --> 05:05.096
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:05.171 --> 05:07.435
That girl has the vocal cords
of a large cat.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.771
- I heard that!
- And the ears of...

05:09.842 --> 05:13.869
...whatever animal hears best.
- A dolphin. It's just something I know.

05:16.215 --> 05:18.342
Did you check in
with immigration today?

05:18.418 --> 05:22.320
Today, yesterday. Isn't it enough
they dragged me away like a criminal?

05:22.388 --> 05:26.085
Just calm down.
I'm just trying to help you.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.920
They assigned me to
some program called ISAP.

05:28.995 --> 05:32.362
They're sending a caseworker next month.
We have to talk about it now?

05:32.432 --> 05:34.992
- Holidays should be about family.
- [Woman] Watch it!

05:35.068 --> 05:36.933
- [Tires screeching]
- [Thudding]

05:37.003 --> 05:38.129
What?

05:39.739 --> 05:43.140
Accident! Mom! Gina! Christmas tree!

05:43.209 --> 05:45.871
It's officially the start
of the holiday season.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.640
You ran over my Christmas tree!

05:47.714 --> 05:51.616
Well, I was aiming for you!
You left it in the middle of the street!

05:51.684 --> 05:53.413
I just took it off the Tracker.

05:53.486 --> 05:56.148
I had to put it somewhere
when I opened the door.

05:56.222 --> 06:01.023
The street is public property. Unlike
this house, which is not. So get out!

06:01.094 --> 06:02.618
You better watch out.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.789
I know when you're sleeping
and I know when you're awake!

06:09.435 --> 06:10.424
Oops.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.975
- Ho, ho, ho!
- You're late.

06:18.044 --> 06:22.310
Love the crystal menorah next to
the sterling silver Santa. So taboo!

06:22.382 --> 06:25.977
- Don't you just love the holidays?
- They're fabulous.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.714
So, is Nico coming home for Christmas?

06:28.788 --> 06:31.018
She's spending it
with her father in Dubai.

06:31.090 --> 06:35.220
Besides, you know Christmas mornings for
me are all about martinis and valium.

06:35.294 --> 06:36.818
Yummy.

06:37.196 --> 06:41.132
You did not just take the whole wheat
bagel. You know I always eat that one.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.668
Sorry, I thought we were
sharing everything,

06:43.736 --> 06:46.864
now that I know about
our mysterious friend.

06:46.939 --> 06:50.636
- Right?
- Right.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.769
That is so wrong!

06:52.845 --> 06:56.542
I know, believe me. We've been
consistently over budget every issue.

06:56.616 --> 06:58.345
We had to cut costs somewhere.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.612
[Both] Boo!

06:59.685 --> 07:03.246
Come on, an office party
at the office. That'll be fun.

07:03.322 --> 07:06.120
- Yeah, like waxing is fun.
- [Gags]

07:06.192 --> 07:08.353
Thank you for your enthusiasm, Betty.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.794
Betty has something
to be excited about.

07:10.863 --> 07:13.798
<i>She's been offered
an amazing new position at MYW.</i>

07:13.866 --> 07:16.460
And I hope she'll consider taking it.

07:20.139 --> 07:22.130
We'll be looking for her replacement.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.802
Anyone interested,
leave your resume with Betty.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.469
And that's it. Thank you.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.347
Daniel, what are you doing?

07:29.415 --> 07:32.043
Something you're far too loyal
to ever do.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.313
If I leave, who's going
to take care of you?

07:34.387 --> 07:37.322
We have to find someone
as good as you. Better get started.

07:37.390 --> 07:40.723
I can try. If I don't find
the perfect one, I'm not going anywhere.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.954
There's not enough time, I don't know...

07:43.029 --> 07:45.759
Sometimes we all
have to take leaps of faith.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.596
You being with Sofia
is the best thing for you.

07:48.668 --> 07:51.228
Speaking of Sofia,
I'd like to see you in my office.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.397
There's something I need to tell you.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.742
Would it be inappropriate to throw
a goodbye party and not invite her?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.836
- You know who'd be perfect for the job?
- Anne Hathaway!

08:00.913 --> 08:03.438
- No. Me.
- [Giggling]

08:03.516 --> 08:06.974
Of course! Yeah.
Love your confidence.

08:07.253 --> 08:10.416
She wants you to go out with someone?
That doesn't make sense.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.254
I know, it's crazy.
She thinks some other woman

08:13.326 --> 08:16.625
will make my palms sweat and
my heart race the way they do for her.

08:16.696 --> 08:20.291
- How do you know they won't?
- I'm not good at being faithful.

08:20.366 --> 08:21.993
But...

08:22.068 --> 08:25.560
No one has ever made me
feel the way Sofia does.

08:25.638 --> 08:29.301
In fact, I stopped by to see Nigel
on the way to work this morning.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.515
I'm through with being a bachelor...

08:41.087 --> 08:43.453
...for good.
- Oh, my God!

08:43.990 --> 08:45.150
Are you serious?

08:45.825 --> 08:49.727
I mean, congratulations! It's great.

08:49.795 --> 08:52.320
Look, I know what you're thinking,

08:52.398 --> 08:55.265
but it's like they say.

08:55.334 --> 08:58.701
- Well, what do they say?
- "When you know, you know."

08:59.105 --> 09:01.130
And I do... know.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.904
Well, I'm so happy for you,
Daniel. And for Sofia.

09:04.977 --> 09:06.376
Thanks.

09:06.445 --> 09:08.811
Now these are just on loan until

09:08.881 --> 09:11.406
I figure out which one's
gonna be perfect for her.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.817
I'm glad to hear you have no intention
of testing out her theory.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.151
I know how you get
around beautiful women.

get Daniel an assistant,

10:13.946 --> 10:16.813
and get Justin a signed photo
of Lindsay Lohan in two days.

10:16.882 --> 10:20.283
Well, today is, like,
your lucky day. Hire me.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.981
- You know you wanna.
- Are you serious?

10:23.055 --> 10:27.219
- After what you both have been through?
- What is the first thing I said to you?

10:27.293 --> 10:29.921
- "Are you 'the before'?"
- OK, the second thing.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.998
- "Are you delivering something?"
- Whatever.

10:33.065 --> 10:37.525
<i>The point is, I wanted this job way
before you or Daniel ever came to Mode.</i>

10:37.603 --> 10:40.003
I have a brain
to go with this beautiful body.

10:40.072 --> 10:42.836
- Yeah, OK...
- Look, I can prove it to you.

10:42.908 --> 10:45.741
Let me help you plan the party.
I've got connections.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.177
Plus, I can get loads of free crap.

10:48.247 --> 10:51.307
Well, I mean,
I could use the help.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.750
OK, you're on. Anything else?

10:53.819 --> 10:55.844
Oh, yeah. Snow's here.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.464
Oh, man! I'm sorry.

11:05.531 --> 11:08.864

You've got a little...
right here...

11:17.443 --> 11:18.740
Gosh, I'm sorry.

11:18.811 --> 11:21.803
That was very unprofessional.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.282
- Let me help clean up.
- Don't worry about it.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.648
Ow! [chuckles]

11:28.354 --> 11:31.380
Actually, you're just the girl
I've been looking for.

11:31.457 --> 11:34.858
Oh, no, I'm sure that
there are other girls...

11:34.927 --> 11:36.622
No, it's about the party.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.857
I'm supposed to
oversee the budget. So...

11:38.931 --> 11:42.230
...guess I'll be on top of you
for the next couple days.

11:43.002 --> 11:46.062
- Party-wise.
- Oh... right.

11:47.339 --> 11:49.136

12:22.341 --> 12:24.935
Show them in. Oh, no.

12:26.946 --> 12:28.971
That's my ex-girlfriend, Aerin.

12:29.048 --> 12:31.744
She broke my heart. She was my first.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.214
First supermodel.

12:34.286 --> 12:36.311
- God, that girl knew how to...
- Hey.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.254
Aerin. What are you doing here?

12:39.325 --> 12:41.759
Taking my clothes off.

12:42.194 --> 12:45.095
- Could you give us a second?
- Sure.

12:46.732 --> 12:49.496
- Do you need me to stay?
- No. I'll... I'll be fine.

12:49.568 --> 12:52.469
- Bring the rest of the models in.
- That's going to help.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.647
No.

29:37.542 --> 29:38.770
You know...

29:40.345 --> 29:42.142
I'm actually wearing those now.

30:01.166 --> 30:04.863
Daniel! [screaming]
I need you! There's a fire in the...

30:04.936 --> 30:08.064
Oh, screw it.
Just stop kissing that tramp!

30:08.640 --> 30:10.733
You are practically engaged.

30:10.809 --> 30:14.575
Look at that. Dry as a bone.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.273
I'm sorry, Aerin.

30:16.347 --> 30:18.713
- You're beautiful.
- I know.

30:18.783 --> 30:22.184
- But I'm in love with someone else.
- Her?

30:23.555 --> 30:27.184
Because I'm sure the three of us
could work something out.

30:29.027 --> 30:31.222
No. Not her.

30:32.096 --> 30:35.065
Whatever. There's other men
at this party, you know.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.110
I am so good.

30:51.182 --> 30:55.141
- You girls still playing that game?
- This is not a game, Papi.

30:55.753 --> 31:00.383
You know, Gina's parents won a cruise to
Alaska in that supermarket sweepstakes.

31:00.458 --> 31:03.052
- Brr.
- They're gone for a week.

31:03.127 --> 31:06.255
Maybe you should give her a break.
You know, forgive, forget.

31:06.331 --> 31:08.925
- A little holiday spirit?
- Yeah, right.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.331
[Gina yells, grunts]

31:10.401 --> 31:11.732
[Justin] Santa?

31:14.038 --> 31:17.940
Well, if it isn't
the bitch who stole Christmas.

31:18.009 --> 31:22.241
- Ow! I think it's broken.
- Well, I hope it was worth it.

31:22.313 --> 31:23.780
Come on.

31:24.983 --> 31:28.111
Why does it always
have to be such a comp...

31:28.186 --> 31:30.620
...competition with you, Gina? God!

31:30.688 --> 31:32.986
Why? Are you serious?

31:33.057 --> 31:36.925
<i>We have been competing ever since
you stole my Electric Youth routine</i>

31:36.995 --> 31:38.860
and won Miss Junior Teen Queens.

31:39.230 --> 31:43.667
I can never win with you.
I guess I should just stop trying.

31:44.002 --> 31:46.163
Well, yeah.

31:48.373 --> 31:51.399
Why don't you come inside?
You need to get some ice on that.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.271
Come on, we got eggnog.

31:55.146 --> 31:56.477
And brandy.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.382
- [Justin] It's a Christmas miracle!
- [Hilda chuckles]

32:09.694 --> 32:11.389
Well...

32:11.462 --> 32:13.623
...will you give it to him already?

32:13.698 --> 32:17.293
Willie, please. I didn't mean
anything that I said ever.

32:17.368 --> 32:20.735
In fact, I will never say anything again
if that's what you want!

32:21.706 --> 32:23.230
- Mmm.
- [Car alarm beeps]

32:23.308 --> 32:24.400
[Yells]

32:26.311 --> 32:28.643
Merry Christmas, Marc.

32:28.713 --> 32:32.877
- Huh? What? This?
- [Man] It's a 2007, fresh off the lot.

32:33.851 --> 32:37.218
It's Jody Pennette.
Pennette Auto Mall.

32:37.288 --> 32:39.256
Oh...

32:40.291 --> 32:43.192
This is... bigger than my apartment!

32:48.266 --> 32:50.996
Are you trying to buy my silence?

32:52.570 --> 32:55.038
Because that's a definite possibility.

32:57.342 --> 33:00.436
So, I think I found you
your new assistant.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.439
Really? Who?

33:03.514 --> 33:07.280
Well, this might come
as a surprise to you, but it's Amanda.

33:07.352 --> 33:09.149
Amanda who?

33:09.220 --> 33:10.687
Amanda.

33:10.755 --> 33:13.986
Pretty blonde. Kind of a bitch.
Sits at the big circular desk.

33:14.058 --> 33:17.152
Mmm... Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.

33:17.228 --> 33:19.287
I'm serious.

33:19.364 --> 33:22.697
I wouldn't leave if I didn't know
someone was here to protect you.

33:22.767 --> 33:24.962
And tonight Amanda proved
that she can.

33:25.036 --> 33:27.732
You're right... she did.

33:29.340 --> 33:32.138
So, if you're serious
about this, then...

33:34.112 --> 33:35.841
...I guess this is goodbye.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.819
You've earned it.

34:07.512 --> 34:09.275
I don't know what to say.

34:11.482 --> 34:13.609
But, thank you...

34:14.452 --> 34:16.043
...for everything.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.156
I'm very proud of you, Betty.

34:28.366 --> 34:30.061
You know, you've...

34:30.935 --> 34:33.301
You're destined for
bigger things than this.

34:55.893 --> 34:59.886
Wait, so the other gifts,
that wasn't you?

35:01.032 --> 35:03.023
Uh... What other gifts?

35:04.302 --> 35:06.065
Never mind.

35:06.671 --> 35:10.107
- Merry Christmas, Daniel.
- Merry Christmas, Betty.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.741
Sofia, hi.

35:48.746 --> 35:51.408
I just got something to tell you.

35:54.485 --> 35:56.919
You do take my breath away.

35:59.223 --> 36:01.657
You make my heart beat faster.

36:03.728 --> 36:06.720
You make my palms... sweat.

36:08.666 --> 36:11.601
But that doesn't mean
I don't love you.

36:12.370 --> 36:14.429
It means I do.

36:18.209 --> 36:19.870
You know, sometimes...

36:19.944 --> 36:23.402
...your heart knows
things your mind can't explain.

36:24.949 --> 36:28.646
And my heart doesn't race
for anyone else.

36:30.755 --> 36:33.019
I love you, Sofia.

36:40.131 --> 36:42.531
It's Daniel, by the way.

37:26.777 --> 37:29.541
Betty! Betty, where are you going?

37:36.687 --> 37:39.019
- [Gina] Use a lighter color...
- [Justin] Mom!

37:39.090 --> 37:41.388
- [Gina] I swear to God!
- All in one movement.

37:41.459 --> 37:44.087
- That is impossible!
- No, it ain't.

37:44.161 --> 37:46.391
- Does this need glitter?
- Absolutely.

37:46.464 --> 37:48.762
Oh, my God! OK, hold on.

37:48.833 --> 37:50.494
- Show me.
- OK, start over here.

37:50.568 --> 37:52.798
- Then you go like...
- Did hell freeze over?

37:54.639 --> 37:57.301
- I still don't understand.
- Start in the middle...

38:05.816 --> 38:07.807
There an easier way to do that?

38:07.885 --> 38:11.218
Well, I was gonna wait
for it to melt, but...

38:12.156 --> 38:13.680
So...

38:14.425 --> 38:16.689
Betty thinks you should
be my new assistant.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.820
Really?

38:19.897 --> 38:22.229
Yep. I do, too.

38:22.667 --> 38:25.636
- [Gasps] Really?
- You're more than a pretty face.

38:25.703 --> 38:27.034
Even I know that.

38:29.740 --> 38:31.571
So what do you think?

38:31.642 --> 38:34.668
Can we do this? Work together?

38:34.745 --> 38:37.805
Absolutely. Professionals.

38:40.117 --> 38:41.641
Professionals.

38:47.725 --> 38:49.955
Looks like I missed some party.

38:52.596 --> 38:54.757
[Wilhelmina] Ted LeBeau!

38:56.701 --> 38:59.693
[Heartbeat racing]

39:05.142 --> 39:07.770
<i>Hey, mamita. Move your feet.</i>

39:11.916 --> 39:14.612
- So what's eating you?
- Ha-ha.

39:15.920 --> 39:20.016
Hilda, what if I'm 45
and I've still never been on a plane?

39:20.091 --> 39:22.958
If you want to fly on a plane,
you're going to.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.961
You're a dreamer, Betty.

39:25.029 --> 39:28.487
<i>Now, look at you. You're 22 years old,
you already work at Mode.</i>

39:28.566 --> 39:30.898
You can do anything.

39:30.968 --> 39:33.459
Well... I sure hope you're right...

39:33.537 --> 39:36.665
...about everything.
- What is that? Let me see.

39:38.442 --> 39:43.573
Oh. [chuckling]
Walter loves you so much, Betty.

39:43.647 --> 39:46.081
I wish you could
appreciate that a little more.

39:46.150 --> 39:48.015
I do.

39:48.686 --> 39:50.779
I just want to know for sure.

39:50.855 --> 39:53.380
You know, like...

39:53.457 --> 39:57.086
...like when your heart races
and your palms sweat?

39:58.095 --> 40:01.622
Have you been drinking the
Herbalux Extreme Energy Tea?

40:01.699 --> 40:03.064
[Doorbell rings]

40:03.134 --> 40:04.863
That's probably Walter.

40:06.637 --> 40:09.765
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Hey, Walter. Merry Christmas.

40:09.840 --> 40:13.207
Hey, how come your Christmas lights
spell "Hilda Sucks?"

40:13.277 --> 40:14.904
Don't ask.

40:16.981 --> 40:20.439
- So, you ready for your last present?
- Huh?

40:21.652 --> 40:26.089
- Ta-da!
- Walter! You? You've been...

40:26.157 --> 40:29.888
Yeah, well, Daniel helped me sneak
the other presents into the office.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.121
I wanted it to be a surprise.

40:34.532 --> 40:36.830
- [Phone ringing]
- Hmm.

40:38.235 --> 40:41.204
- Hello?
- Hi. Is Betty there?

40:41.272 --> 40:44.241
- Yeah. Who's calling?
- It's Henry.

40:44.308 --> 40:47.004
Her... friend from work.

40:50.581 --> 40:52.446
Hello? Are you still there?

40:52.516 --> 40:54.848
Yeah. Sorry. Um...

40:54.919 --> 40:57.444
Actually, no, Betty's busy.
Can I take a message?

40:57.521 --> 41:01.321
<i>Yes, please.
Tell her, about the party...</i>

41:04.795 --> 41:06.558
You know what?

41:06.630 --> 41:10.293
<i>I just wanted to let her know
that Rudolph's on tomorrow night.</i>

41:10.367 --> 41:13.598
She can call me,
if she wants to watch it.

41:13.671 --> 41:16.231
<i>You know... together.</i>

41:16.640 --> 41:20.974
Uh... OK. I'll tell her. Thanks. Bye.

41:25.749 --> 41:27.046
[Sighs]

41:31.088 --> 41:35.718
I know that you think I don't
get your new life in Manhattan,

41:35.793 --> 41:37.920
but... I want to try.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.964
I... I want to be a part of it.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.799
Thank you.

41:57.548 --> 41:59.573
Ooh! Candy canes! Yummy!

42:00.050 --> 42:02.280
Don't you just love Christmas?

42:07.424 --> 42:11.827

42:13.998 --> 42:18.492
