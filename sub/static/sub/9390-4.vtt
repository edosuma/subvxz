Oh, one minute to opening,

00:36.937 --> 00:39.270
Why are they selling
all those DVDs so cheap?

00:39.272 --> 00:42.407
Because, Chris,
DVDs are outdated and obsolete.

00:42.409 --> 00:44.275
Like white track stars.

00:44.277 --> 00:46.211
On your marks, get set.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.445
White guys, go!

00:47.447 --> 00:48.947
I have high hopes
for this.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.316
I had a Clif bar
before we started.

00:51.318 --> 00:52.984
Everybody else!

00:53.786 --> 00:54.352
(gasps)

00:54.354 --> 00:56.755
Phew. I thought
they were coming after us.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.857
All right, everyone,
all DVDs are a dollar,

00:58.859 --> 01:00.291
and everything must go!

01:00.293 --> 01:01.726
Come on in!

01:02.762 --> 01:04.529
Please be here.
Please be here.

01:04.531 --> 01:08.867
Oh, sweet mother of God,
there you are!

01:10.069 --> 01:12.303
I'll watch you
with the lights off.

01:12.305 --> 01:13.838
(chuckling)

01:13.840 --> 01:15.040
Like I would dare.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.175
You're getting
<i>Dan In Real Life?</i>

01:17.177 --> 01:18.877
What? I heard
it's good.

01:18.879 --> 01:19.444
No, I get it.

01:19.446 --> 01:21.713
He's resting his head
on pancakes.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.014
It looks hilarious.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.215
The joke,
of course, being

01:24.217 --> 01:26.418
that one wouldn't
generally do that

01:26.420 --> 01:30.755
were there
a pillow available.

01:31.624 --> 01:34.526
Oh, my God, <i>Road House!</i>

01:34.528 --> 01:35.226
I want to buy this!

01:35.228 --> 01:36.861
Great, and as a
bonus, I'll throw in

01:36.863 --> 01:38.830
<i>What Dreams May Come</i>

01:38.832 --> 01:40.265
No, thank you.
No charge.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.433
I do not want it.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.367
But it's free, sir.

01:42.369 --> 01:46.538
If that DVD even touches
Road House, I will kill you.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.906
Don't worry.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.107
Someday someone will come

01:49.109 --> 01:51.543
and take you home
for their very own.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.308
These drunk, redneck truckers
are trying

02:23.310 --> 02:24.342
to have their way with me!

02:24.344 --> 02:28.046
Not while my scrotum is pressed
up against my stomach

02:28.048 --> 02:30.381
in these jeans, they won't.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.062
<i>Road House.</i>

02:44.064 --> 02:45.263
That was awesome.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.531
And its message
is timeless.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.333
Peter, the only message
in that movie is

02:48.335 --> 02:51.302
that every problem in life
can be solved by kicking.

02:51.304 --> 02:52.971
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.405
Brian, you're right.

02:54.407 --> 02:55.573
Peter, I'm joking.

02:55.575 --> 02:57.008
What did you say to me?

02:57.010 --> 02:58.510
Peter, what are you doing?

02:58.512 --> 02:59.911
Get off my plane.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.112
That's not even the same...

03:01.114 --> 03:02.247
Oh! What the hell?!

03:02.249 --> 03:05.016
Not gonna talk to me
like that in my bar.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.352
It's not a bar. Oh!

03:15.861 --> 03:18.530
PETER:
Oh, that's right.
Cleveland moved.

03:20.099 --> 03:21.666
Here's your
burger, sir.

03:21.668 --> 03:22.400
Thank you.

03:22.402 --> 03:24.536
Sir, I need
another $1.25.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.271
Is that right?

03:28.007 --> 03:29.674
Keep the change.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.543
<i>Road House.</i>

03:33.612 --> 03:34.746
Ugh!

03:35.247 --> 03:37.982
Okay, that is the last time
you are gonna pull that crap.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.584
(cries)
You hear me?!

03:39.586 --> 03:41.219
Yes.
Do you hear me?!

03:41.221 --> 03:42.287
(screams)

03:42.289 --> 03:43.488
Yes.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.355
(screaming)

03:44.357 --> 03:46.691
Now, you are gonna hold
down that football

03:46.693 --> 03:48.393
until Charlie
Brown kicks it.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.494
You got that?

03:49.496 --> 03:50.895
(crying):
Yes.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.198
Go ahead, Charlie.

03:54.533 --> 03:55.400
Yay!

03:55.402 --> 03:56.668
And you know
what else?

03:56.670 --> 03:57.635
I did some
checking around.

03:57.637 --> 04:01.439
You're not a
licensed therapist.

04:01.441 --> 04:03.441
<i>Road House.</i>

04:06.212 --> 04:08.279
You know, it's
still early, Peter.

04:08.281 --> 04:11.115
What do you say we horse
around a little, huh?

04:11.117 --> 04:13.585
I think I can get
on board with that.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.087
(both giggling)

04:18.591 --> 04:19.791
(kick sound)
Ow!

04:19.793 --> 04:20.191
<i>Road House.</i>

04:20.193 --> 04:22.293
Peter, for God's sakes,
if you're gonna do that,

04:22.295 --> 04:24.229
at least aim
for my breasts.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.096
(kick)

04:25.098 --> 04:26.497
(giggling):
Oh, yeah.

04:26.499 --> 04:27.332
(giggling)

04:27.334 --> 04:30.034
(amorously):
<i>Road House.</i>

04:31.971 --> 04:35.506
Peter, I don't think you should
be driving with your feet.

04:35.508 --> 04:38.509
<i>Road House.</i>
<i>Wait. Why you taking</i>
<i>the back way home?</i>

04:38.511 --> 04:39.611
There are so many turns.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.512
(kick)
<i>Road House.</i>

04:41.514 --> 04:43.348
(kick)
<i>Road House.</i>

04:43.350 --> 04:45.416
(kick)
<i>Road House.</i>

04:45.418 --> 04:46.584
(kick)
<i>Road House.</i>

04:46.586 --> 04:49.287
(kicking)
<i>Road Hou... Roa... Road...</i>

04:49.289 --> 04:50.521
(kicking)
<i>Road Hou... Roa... Roa...</i>

04:50.523 --> 04:53.057
(kicking)
<i>Road Hou... Road Hou... Road...</i>

04:53.059 --> 04:54.559
(kicking)
<i>Roa... Road...</i>

04:54.561 --> 04:56.094
<i>Road House.</i>

04:57.363 --> 04:58.563
<i>Road House.</i>

04:58.565 --> 04:59.764
Oh, my God!

04:59.766 --> 05:01.933
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.402
Sorry. I wasn't really looking
where I was going.

05:04.404 --> 05:06.738
Probably a little
blame on our side, too.

05:06.740 --> 05:07.472
PETER:
<i>Road House?</i>

05:07.474 --> 05:10.475
Well, I guess we're just
lucky nobody got hurt.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.276
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

05:11.278 --> 05:14.078
But, uh, you know, I sort of
have one other problem.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.647
Maybe you can
help me out.
What's that?

05:15.649 --> 05:19.183
I have a dinner reservation
for two tonight at Dominick's,

05:19.185 --> 05:20.718
and it's just me.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.753
I see your problem.

05:21.755 --> 05:22.720
I think I might
be able to help.

05:22.722 --> 05:25.456
Ma'am, you want me to kick
those dents out for you?

05:25.458 --> 05:27.425
Peter, we've had complaints
from all over town.

05:27.427 --> 05:29.694
You're gonna have to
stop with the kicking.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.262
Oh, yeah? I think my scary,

05:31.264 --> 05:33.564
otherworldly,
shadowy, spirit friends

05:33.566 --> 05:36.200
might have something
to say about that.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.436
(screaming)

05:43.442 --> 05:44.842
<i>Ghost.</i>

05:50.249 --> 05:51.849
(doorbell chimes)

05:51.951 --> 05:53.484
Can I help you?
Hi. I'm Brian,

05:53.486 --> 05:55.353
and I'm here
to pick up Nicole.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.554
Oh, hi. I'm Rita, her mom.

05:56.556 --> 06:00.224
You must be the one
she had that fender bender with.

06:00.226 --> 06:01.059
Well, I got to meet Nicole,

06:01.061 --> 06:03.528
so I prefer to think of it
as a happy accident.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.796
Is she ready?

06:04.798 --> 06:05.697
Oh.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.165
Well, unfortunately,

06:07.167 --> 06:09.233
she left for dinner
with another guy

06:09.235 --> 06:10.969
about half an hour ago.

06:10.971 --> 06:11.903
What?! We had a date.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.638
Yeah, I'm afraid
that's Nicole.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.872
She's 21 and gorgeous.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.977
Guys ask her out all the time,
and I-I think she loses track.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.345
Oh, for God's sake.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.312
Well, let me at least

06:21.314 --> 06:25.550
leave my car insurance
information for her.

06:26.251 --> 06:28.219
Is that...
your condom?

06:28.221 --> 06:28.653
No! I... I mean,

06:28.655 --> 06:30.822
I mean, I-I-I wasn't gonna
use that on your daughter.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.623
I mean, I-I-I wouldn't...
I would not...

06:32.625 --> 06:34.492
I would not use a condom
on your daughter.

06:34.494 --> 06:37.428
I mean, I-I-I would,
if I was having sex with her,

06:37.430 --> 06:38.363
which obviously,
I would not do.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.798
But if... if... I mean,
I'm safe and all, you know.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.368
I-I get an AIDS test
once every three months.

06:43.370 --> 06:44.235
And-and-and not
because I... I...

06:44.237 --> 06:46.771
You know, it's not
because I have a lot of sex.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.707
I just... I just eat a lot
of poo off the street.

06:49.709 --> 06:52.176
Come to think of it,
how did this get

06:52.178 --> 06:53.878
in my wallet
in the first place?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.279
STEWIE:
<i>"Dear Brian,</i>

06:55.281 --> 06:57.415
<i>"somewhere between the point</i>
<i>when you're excited enough</i>

06:57.417 --> 06:59.250
<i>"to want it</i>

<i>"think about your future.</i>

07:00.720 --> 07:02.353
<i>Your friend, Stewie."</i>

07:02.355 --> 07:04.489
Well, I think
I've been humiliated enough

07:04.491 --> 07:05.523
for one evening.

07:05.525 --> 07:06.290
Sorry to bother you.

07:06.292 --> 07:08.793
If it's any consolation,
I would never have stood you up.

07:08.795 --> 07:12.296
Well, I guess that makes you
one of the rare ones nowadays.

07:12.298 --> 07:13.831
Your husband's a lucky guy.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.233
Divorced.

07:15.235 --> 07:15.767
Oh.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.703
Well, at the risk of
humiliating myself once again,

07:18.705 --> 07:20.271
I still have a reservation.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.773
Well, I don't
have plans.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.407
Well, terrific.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.842
Hey, maybe I'll get
to use this after all, huh?

07:24.844 --> 07:26.644
(laughs)
I'm-I'm just... I'm kidding.

07:26.646 --> 07:27.478
(laughs)
Oh, please.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.615
At my age, I don't have
to worry about pregnancy.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.682
(laughing)

07:31.684 --> 07:32.483
How old are ya?

07:32.485 --> 07:34.552
(laughing)
Oh, you don't
want to know!

07:34.554 --> 07:36.187
(laughing):
I kind of do.

07:36.189 --> 07:39.190
Hang on. Just let me get
my purse, and we can go.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.224
Wow. She seems great.

07:40.226 --> 07:44.295
We're getting along better than
Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.764
BOTH:
You want to smoke some crack?

07:46.766 --> 07:48.332
Aah!

07:48.334 --> 07:49.333
Aw.

07:49.335 --> 07:50.635
I love you.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.804
Get the (bleep) crack!

07:55.707 --> 07:56.908
Brian, you want
some lasagna?

07:56.910 --> 07:59.410
Oh, no, thanks.
Rita and I grabbed
a bite already.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.446
Gosh, you've been seeing
this Rita for weeks now,

08:01.448 --> 08:03.414
and you still haven't
brought her over to the house.

08:03.416 --> 08:08.352
(chuckles):
When are we gonna meet
the lovely lady, huh?

08:08.354 --> 08:09.854
Oh, she's being ironic.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.823
What are you saying,
I don't date lovely women?

08:11.825 --> 08:12.857
Yeah, you got it.
You got it.

08:12.859 --> 08:15.726
No, it just seems like some
of your past girlfriends

08:15.728 --> 08:18.296
have been a little
dumb and trampy.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.363
First of all, that's not true,

08:19.365 --> 08:20.765
and second of all,
she's not like that.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.334
She's wonderful,
she's smart, she's pretty.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.536
And, you know, the only reason
I haven't brought her around

08:25.538 --> 08:27.672
is that you guys don't always
make the best impression

08:27.674 --> 08:29.740
with girls I date--
especially Peter.

08:29.742 --> 08:31.709
Hey, aren't you that chick
from the bathroom door?

08:31.711 --> 08:34.412
Come on, Peter. She doesn't
want to talk about work.

08:34.414 --> 08:35.480
What's it like in there?

08:35.482 --> 08:37.715
I assume it's like how
it is in the men's room.

08:37.717 --> 08:41.352
Oh, there's a long trough
with a big poo in it?

08:46.425 --> 08:49.293
You know, Brian, the past
few weeks have been great.

08:49.295 --> 08:50.728
I can't remember
the last time

08:50.730 --> 08:52.930
I've had this much fun
dating somebody.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.900
I can remember the last
time I have: never.

08:55.902 --> 08:56.901
(both chuckling)

08:56.903 --> 08:58.636
That's the writer
in you, Brian.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.472
Did you always know that's
what you wanted to do?

09:01.474 --> 09:02.740
Well, actually, I really thought

09:02.742 --> 09:04.709
I was going to be
an actor at one point.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.677
I even got
a few high profile gigs.

09:06.679 --> 09:07.778
Really? Anything I've seen?

09:07.780 --> 09:10.915
Oh, you ever heard of a tiny,
little independent movie

09:10.917 --> 09:12.316
called <i>Die Hard?</i>

09:12.318 --> 09:13.951
Wow! You were in that?
Sure was.

09:13.953 --> 09:17.522
Hey, what do you say
we go back to my place,
and I'll show it to you?

09:17.524 --> 09:19.457
Sounds good to me.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.328
We'll have to be
a little quiet;
everyone's asleep.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.963
Have a seat.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.331
Okay, watch this.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.599
This is my scene.

09:28.601 --> 09:30.301
McCLANE:
Doesn't make sense, man.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.669
Hey, don't ask me, man.

09:31.671 --> 09:35.406
I'm just a desk jockey who was
on my way home when you rang.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.841
The way you drove that car,

09:36.843 --> 09:38.843
I figured you
for the street, Al.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.745
In my youth.
In my youth.

09:40.747 --> 09:41.979
Okay, here it comes.
Watch, watch.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.515
MAN:
...we've had situations
where the hostages

09:44.517 --> 09:46.984
have embraced their captors
after their release,

09:46.986 --> 09:49.754
and even corresponded
with them in prison.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.557
No, no, no, darling.
Asian Dawn.

09:52.559 --> 09:55.693
Dawn, D-A-W-N.

09:55.695 --> 09:56.661
Sir?

09:56.663 --> 09:57.461
I... Yeah?

09:57.463 --> 09:58.796
Sir, the FBI is here.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.932
Hold...
The FBI is here now?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.633
Yes, sir.
Right over there.

10:02.635 --> 10:04.502
Hold this.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.003
Want a breath mint?

10:06.005 --> 10:07.471
(laughs)

10:07.473 --> 10:08.573
Breath mint.

10:08.575 --> 10:09.440
I ad-libbed that line.

10:09.442 --> 10:13.844
Well, I had no idea
I was dating a famous actor.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.284
Should we go upstairs?

10:20.286 --> 10:22.453
Sounds good to me.

10:43.008 --> 10:44.175
(moans)

10:44.177 --> 10:48.312
That's right, Shia,
give me all you got.

10:53.685 --> 10:55.720
Okay, the coast is clear.

10:56.555 --> 10:58.556
Oh. Good morning.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.024
Oh, uh, hey, Lois.

11:00.026 --> 11:02.059
Who's, uh,
who's your friend?

11:02.061 --> 11:04.528
Uh, Rita, this is Lois.

11:04.530 --> 11:05.429
Lois, Rita.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.931
So great
to meet you.

11:06.933 --> 11:07.999
Lovely to
meet you.

11:08.001 --> 11:08.933
Perfect, everyone hits it off.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.601
Listen, Rita, why don't you wait
in the car,

11:10.603 --> 11:13.471
I'll be out in a minute.
Okay, sweetie.

11:14.039 --> 11:15.373
Well, you met her.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.607
What do you think?

11:16.609 --> 11:18.175
(laughs)

11:18.177 --> 11:20.444
What?
What do I think?

11:20.446 --> 11:22.013
She's a hundred!

11:22.015 --> 11:23.414
(laughing):
Oh, my God!

11:23.416 --> 11:24.548
Peter, did you see her?

11:24.550 --> 11:25.616
PETER:
I'm looking at her now!

11:25.618 --> 11:26.951
I can see her
from the window up here!

11:26.953 --> 11:29.687
Hey, anybody make
a Jessica Tandy joke yet?

11:29.689 --> 11:30.288
No!

11:30.290 --> 11:31.656
Awesome!
I'll be right down!

11:31.658 --> 11:32.990
Hey, Brian,
who are you dating,

11:32.992 --> 11:34.692
Jessica Tandy?
Son of a bitch.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.762
Damn it, Chris, I called
that from upstairs!

11:37.764 --> 11:39.096
What are you guys
talking about?

11:39.098 --> 11:39.864
She's a beautiful woman.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.766
You know, Lois, you of all
people should be pleased.

11:41.768 --> 11:44.068
I mean, all the crap I take
for dating young bimbos.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.704
(chuckling):
How old is she, Brian?

11:46.706 --> 11:47.938
Wha-What difference
does it make?

11:47.940 --> 11:49.940
Age has nothing to
do with anything.

11:49.942 --> 11:50.775
Okay, you know what?

11:50.777 --> 11:51.676
I'll bring her
to dinner,

11:51.678 --> 11:54.011
and you can see for yourself
what a bright, fun,

11:54.013 --> 11:55.813
and charming woman
she is.
Wonderful.

11:55.815 --> 11:59.483
I'll cook something
that's not too binding.

12:01.687 --> 12:04.822
Well, Rita, I'm so glad
you could join us for dinner.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.390
Oh, thanks
for having me, Lois.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.059
This food is delicious.

12:08.061 --> 12:08.859
Oh, thank you.

12:08.861 --> 12:10.294
I'm so glad
you can taste it.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.430
Hey, you know what
we haven't done for a while?

12:12.432 --> 12:13.164
Go around the table,

12:13.166 --> 12:15.066
and everybody says
what year they were born.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.734
Uh, so, kids, how
was your day?

12:16.736 --> 12:18.803
Well, the sandbox...
It was great!

12:18.805 --> 12:19.570
Uh, guess he's
going first.

12:19.572 --> 12:23.174
We got a new pencil sharpener
in math class!

12:23.176 --> 12:23.841
Well, that's nice.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.043
Say, Rita, who was president
when you were born?

12:26.045 --> 12:28.012
Great pot roast, Lois.
Thank you, Brian.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.014
Rita, would you like
me to cut yours up

12:30.016 --> 12:31.849
a little smaller?
Oh, I'm fine.

12:31.851 --> 12:32.483
Boy, speaking of that,

12:32.485 --> 12:34.518
I don't know how many people
have asked me today

12:34.520 --> 12:36.887
where I was when Martin
Luther King was shot.

12:36.889 --> 12:37.822
I'm sure you've been asked.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.990
What do you tell them?
Ugh, who can forget?

12:39.992 --> 12:43.427
I remember just
crying like a baby.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.595
Crying like a baby,

12:44.597 --> 12:47.131
or crying like someone
in college?

12:47.133 --> 12:48.999
Say, Brian, on her
answering machine,

12:49.001 --> 12:51.001
how long after her
message is the beep?

12:51.003 --> 12:52.903
Wow, this has just
been a delight.

12:52.905 --> 12:54.004
Oh, you can't go yet.

12:54.006 --> 12:55.473
We haven't had dessert.

12:55.475 --> 12:56.774
Interesting.
You know, the first time

12:56.776 --> 12:59.410
I had dessert was
36 years ago today.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.946
How about you, Rita, you
remember your first dessert?

13:01.948 --> 13:02.780
Oh, Lord, no.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.482
It was so many
years ago.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.149
Like 40 years ago?

13:05.151 --> 13:07.084
Peter.
What were
stagecoaches like?

13:07.086 --> 13:09.620
50 years ago?
Would that be a good guess?

13:09.622 --> 13:10.788
Oh, dear.
Peter!

13:10.790 --> 13:12.990
How old are you?!
How old are you?!

13:12.992 --> 13:14.458
Fifty! Okay!

13:14.460 --> 13:15.626
I'm 50!

13:15.628 --> 13:18.462
(crying):
Happy now?!

13:19.631 --> 13:20.798
You people
are awful!

13:20.800 --> 13:23.000
You know, this is what's wrong
with society!

13:23.002 --> 13:25.669
Nobody bats an eye
if a woman dates an older man,

13:25.671 --> 13:27.671
but God forbid
it's the other way around!

13:27.673 --> 13:29.840
There is nothing wrong
with me dating Rita!

13:29.842 --> 13:32.643
She's beautiful,
she's a charming woman,

13:32.645 --> 13:34.879
and I love her!

13:35.614 --> 13:37.448
(door slamming)

13:41.720 --> 13:44.054
(Rita crying)

13:44.389 --> 13:45.856
Rita...
Oh, Brian,

13:45.858 --> 13:47.191
please leave
me alone.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.260
They're right, I'm
just an old fool

13:49.262 --> 13:50.795
thinking we could
be together.

13:50.797 --> 13:51.996
Will you stop that?
They're insane.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.898
They don't know what
they're talking about.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.966
You're an amazing woman.
(sniffling)

13:55.968 --> 13:58.269
Oh, you're just
saying that.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.236
No, I'm not.

13:59.238 --> 14:02.907
The only thing that matters
is how I feel about you.

14:02.909 --> 14:05.309
Rita... I love you.

14:05.311 --> 14:06.811
I love you,
too, Brian.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.946
I think you're the most
wonderful woman

14:08.948 --> 14:11.048
I've ever met.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.750
Will you marry me?

14:12.752 --> 14:13.751
What did you just say?

14:13.753 --> 14:15.719
Come on, you're only 50,
you heard me.

14:15.721 --> 14:18.122
Will you marry me?
Oh, Brian.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.156
Yes.

14:19.158 --> 14:21.926
Yes, Brian,
I'll marry you!

14:23.962 --> 14:25.162
Hey, Mom.
Hey, Brian.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.030
We'll be upstairs.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.032
Yo, Rita,
you want in on this?

14:28.034 --> 14:28.966
No, thanks.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.201
We just got
engaged!

14:30.203 --> 14:32.303
I'm faithful
to Brian now.

14:32.305 --> 14:32.837
Whatever.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.606
This ain't even
my whole night.

14:41.079 --> 14:41.912
You're engaged?!

14:41.914 --> 14:44.248
Yes. Rita and I are
getting married.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.151
My God, I can't even
react big enough.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.719
Here's Mrs. Garrett.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.386
What?!

14:49.388 --> 14:52.423
Look, if my happiness
means so little to you
all that you have

14:52.425 --> 14:55.125
Charlotte Rae
just standing by
to crack a joke,

14:55.127 --> 14:56.160
then you really
disappoint me.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.896
Look, Brian, I apologize
for the other night.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.798
We-we were all
very insensitive.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.833
And if this is
what you want,

15:02.835 --> 15:04.969
we as a family,
support your decision.

15:04.971 --> 15:07.071
I don't.
I'd-I'd rather you marry

15:07.073 --> 15:12.376
(stammering): a-a-a-a-a-a-a...
a Japanese or something.

15:12.378 --> 15:13.811
I'm with you, too, buddy.

15:13.813 --> 15:15.246
In 20 years, she'll be 70,

15:15.248 --> 15:17.214
and you'll have been dead
for 15 years.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.250
God bless the both of yous.

15:23.188 --> 15:24.021
Hey, it's 4:30.

15:24.023 --> 15:25.756
Isn't there
an early bird special

15:25.758 --> 15:26.724
you should be
running off to?

15:26.726 --> 15:29.226
She's 50, Stewie.
She's not an old woman.

15:29.228 --> 15:30.561
(phone rings)

15:30.563 --> 15:32.696
Hello?
Hey, Rita.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.966
Uh, no, I'm not
hungry yet.

15:36.601 --> 15:38.602
Well, if we get
there by 5:30,

15:38.604 --> 15:39.603
I'm sure they'll honor it.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.272
Brian, is she calling
dinner "supper?"

15:41.274 --> 15:42.973
So, what are you doing
this afternoon?

15:42.975 --> 15:46.043
"Oh, I'm just sorting out my
pills for the week, sweetie."

15:46.045 --> 15:48.846
Well, you do that,
and I'll be over
a little later.

15:48.848 --> 15:49.947
Huh? Did I get it?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.116
Was she sorting out
her pills for the week?

15:52.118 --> 15:55.286
In that little plastic thing
with the seven boxes? Hmm?

15:55.288 --> 15:57.321
Actually, she just
got back from the gym,

15:57.323 --> 15:59.223
and she's jumping
in the shower.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.225
She got a chair
in that shower?

16:01.227 --> 16:01.892
Shut up!

16:01.894 --> 16:03.794
Have archaeologists
ever discovered

16:03.796 --> 16:05.429
ancient Egyptian
pottery in her vagina?

16:05.431 --> 16:08.299
You know what? That one was too
wordy. That one was too wordy.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.401
That-that was-- that was
flawed from the ground up.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.771
It wasn't funny,
and we'll work on it

16:13.773 --> 16:15.873
and get back to you.

16:18.944 --> 16:20.344
BRIAN:
Hey, Rita?
Yeah?

16:20.346 --> 16:21.245
Where do you keep
your toothpaste?

16:21.247 --> 16:23.781
What are you looking for,
tooth polish?

16:23.783 --> 16:24.682
Toothpaste, yeah.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.317
Just use the baking soda.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.217
"Baking soda"?

16:27.219 --> 16:28.953
Ah, what the hell,
I can skip a night.

16:28.955 --> 16:30.955
Oh, I've never noticed
this picture before.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.323
Is that you when you were
a little girl?

16:32.325 --> 16:35.392
Oh, yeah. That's the summer
my family went to DC.

16:35.394 --> 16:38.996
That, uh, flag's missing
some stars there.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.898
Why don't you
come to bed, Brian?

16:40.900 --> 16:43.734
What do you say we make
a little whoopee?

16:43.736 --> 16:45.569
Yeah, sure.
Why not?

16:46.137 --> 16:48.172
(both moaning)

16:48.174 --> 16:49.239
(gasps) Whoo!

16:49.241 --> 16:50.074
Are you okay?

16:50.076 --> 16:51.675
I'm not hurting
you, am I?

16:51.677 --> 16:52.643
No, I'm fine.

16:52.645 --> 16:53.344
What are you
talking about?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.379
I-I just want to make
sure you're comfortable.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.815
(pleasurable moaning)

16:57.817 --> 16:59.383
Oh, I love you, Brian!

16:59.385 --> 17:00.851
Sock it to me!

17:00.853 --> 17:01.785
What?!
Ouch!

17:01.787 --> 17:03.687
What's wrong?!
Oh, nothing.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.521
When I'm on my back,

17:04.523 --> 17:06.957
sometimes my breast can
slide in my armpit.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.026
Just got pinched,
that's all.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.194
Okay.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.631
(pleasurable moaning resumes)

17:13.633 --> 17:14.498
(cracking)
Ow!

17:14.500 --> 17:16.233
Was that your boob?
God, no!

17:16.235 --> 17:18.068
I, I think I broke my hip!

17:18.070 --> 17:19.403
Oh, my God!
Wh-Wh-Wh-What should I do?

17:19.405 --> 17:21.305
Call the number
on my bracelet!

17:21.307 --> 17:24.041
It says, "Murray Hill,
four, one, eight, five."

17:24.043 --> 17:26.377
That's not enough numbers!
That's the number, Brian!

17:26.379 --> 17:29.279
Just dial zero
and read it to Sarah.

17:29.281 --> 17:31.148
For God's sake, Rita!

17:33.585 --> 17:34.251
(sighs):
She's fine.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.787
She's out of surgery
and she's resting.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.188
Well, how did
she break it?

17:38.190 --> 17:39.023
Did she fall?

17:39.025 --> 17:41.892
Well, uh... she--
yes, she fell.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.260
Boy, you know, Brian,
a woman her age

17:43.262 --> 17:44.895
comes in here,
they don't always leave.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.430
Peter, she's going
to be okay.

17:46.432 --> 17:47.831
Listen, Brian,
you say the word

17:47.833 --> 17:49.233
and I'll go in there
with a pillow

17:49.235 --> 17:50.734
and you won't have
any more problems.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.269
How many times do I
have to tell you,

17:52.271 --> 17:53.804
I'm sticking by this woman?

17:53.806 --> 17:55.239
I love her.
Careful, Brian.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.941
Sometimes the things you
love can disappoint you.

17:57.943 --> 17:59.376
Like that Playboy issue.

17:59.378 --> 18:00.411
Ah, here we go.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.513
<i>Playboy's</i>
<i>"Women of the Olympics."</i>

18:02.515 --> 18:04.481
Wow, those are some
broad shoulders.

18:04.483 --> 18:08.452
Okay, I guess small boobs
are good for swimming.

18:08.454 --> 18:12.256
That, that--
those are balls.

18:16.027 --> 18:19.396
Brian?!
Brian?!

18:19.398 --> 18:21.265
Oh. Is the soup ready?

18:21.267 --> 18:22.366
Yeah, got it right here.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.234
Oh, good. I need
to take my pills.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.803
It's been three hours.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.871
You know, they warned me
these blue ones

18:27.873 --> 18:30.040
were going to make
me constipated.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.109
Right they were.
Okay.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.044
I am plugged up.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.479
No, I-I got it.

18:38.650 --> 18:41.018
Do it, Brian.
Do it.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.086
(giggles)

18:42.088 --> 18:43.887
It's me as a pillow.

18:43.889 --> 18:44.955
You know what, Brian?

18:44.957 --> 18:47.257
Oh, I could really use
some milk of magnesia.

18:47.259 --> 18:49.460
Okay, well, I'll go
pick some up.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.361
Thanks, Brian.
I love you.

18:51.363 --> 18:53.464
Oh, and-and if
you're going out,

18:53.466 --> 18:54.998
get some milk of magnesia.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Yeah, you just said that.

19:03.074 --> 19:05.209
(giggling)

19:06.444 --> 19:09.246
RITA:
<i>I am plugged up.</i>

19:09.248 --> 19:11.849
(giggling)

19:13.518 --> 19:15.018
(sighs)

19:15.020 --> 19:17.821
Wow, you are
really pretty.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.655
Thanks.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.525
You know, uh,
I wrote a book.

19:21.527 --> 19:22.593
What's that?

19:22.595 --> 19:23.627
It's like
a long magazine.

19:23.629 --> 19:27.264
Huh?
It's like the Internet
made out of a tree.

19:27.266 --> 19:28.398
Oh. Weird.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.067
You want to have sex
in the bathroom?

19:30.069 --> 19:31.502
Oh, gosh, what a treat.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.471
Yes, yes, I-I would--
I would like that.

19:39.110 --> 19:41.078
Boy, that took
you a long time.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.980
Did you have to wait
for the streetcar?

19:42.982 --> 19:45.415
Look, Rita, I have
a confession to make.

19:45.417 --> 19:48.051
I met a girl,
I had a couple drinks,

19:48.053 --> 19:49.052
and I slept with her.

19:49.054 --> 19:51.455
You what?
I know, I feel awful.

19:51.457 --> 19:52.589
It was a terrible thing to do.

19:52.591 --> 19:55.392
I'm so sorry.
It'll never happen again.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.060
But there's an upside.

19:57.062 --> 19:59.196
You see, these past few weeks

19:59.198 --> 20:01.265
I've been doubting
whether we're compatible,

20:01.267 --> 20:02.599
you know, because
of the age difference.

20:02.601 --> 20:05.435
But I realized that
that doesn't matter.

20:05.437 --> 20:09.072
That what-what I get from you
is what I always wanted:

20:09.074 --> 20:11.108
a smart, sexy, real person

20:11.110 --> 20:14.578
who I can talk with and share
every piece of me with.

20:14.580 --> 20:17.247
I had a moment of weakness
today, but in a way,

20:17.249 --> 20:19.249
it's all right
because it's taken me to a place

20:19.251 --> 20:22.219
where I now realize that
you're not too old for me.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.487
Isn't that great?

20:23.489 --> 20:25.489
You're not too old for me!

20:25.491 --> 20:26.623
You know what, Brian?

20:26.625 --> 20:28.525
You're not old
enough for me.

20:28.527 --> 20:30.561
What?
You cheated on me.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.562
That's what happened today.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.565
You can rationalize it any
way you want, but to me,

20:34.567 --> 20:37.234
all that shows is that
you're an immature guy

20:37.236 --> 20:39.203
who doesn't realize
what a catch I am.

20:39.205 --> 20:42.272
I'm sorry, Brian,
but you screwed up.

20:42.274 --> 20:43.740
Now, please go.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.042
But, Rita...
Go!

20:45.044 --> 20:48.979
You can leave my apartment
key on the davenport.

20:50.048 --> 20:50.480
Here?

20:50.482 --> 20:53.550
No, the davenport--
the chesterfield.

20:54.686 --> 20:55.152
On this?

20:55.154 --> 20:58.755
No, does that look
like a divan to you?

20:58.757 --> 20:59.256
Here?

20:59.258 --> 21:01.425
Ugh. Leave 'em
on the chifforobe.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.093
You know what?
Just take your (bleep) keys.

21:03.095 --> 21:07.064
I don't know what
the (bleep) you're
talking about.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.465
(door slams)
