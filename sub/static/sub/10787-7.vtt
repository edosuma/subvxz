00:02.750 --> 00:04.166
IT SUITS YOU.

00:07.166 --> 00:07.667
WHAT'S THAT?

00:07.667 --> 00:09.792
THE LOOK--

00:09.792 --> 00:12.000
DEER STANDING
IN THE ROAD
OF SENIOR YEAR,

00:12.000 --> 00:15.375
CAUGHT
IN THE HEADLIGHTS
OF COLLEGE INDECISION.

00:15.375 --> 00:18.333
I'M SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING
JUST RUNNING AWAY
AND JOINING THE CIRCUS.

00:18.333 --> 00:22.375
WELL...WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE KEEP THAT ONE
AS A FALLBACK?

00:22.375 --> 00:23.667
OK?

00:23.667 --> 00:26.166
NOW, I KNOW THIS
COLLEGE APPLICATION
PROCESS

00:26.166 --> 00:28.333
CAN BE PRETTY DAUNTING,
JOEY, BUT YOU...

00:28.333 --> 00:30.542
ARE WELL AHEAD
OF THE GAME.

00:30.542 --> 00:33.667
EXCEPT FOR...
WILLIAMS COLLEGE.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.959
I'M MISSING
YOUR PEER RECOMMENDATION

00:35.959 --> 00:38.542
FROM "THE PERSON
WHO KNOWS YOU BEST."

00:38.917 --> 00:40.542

[CLEARS THROAT]

00:41.542 --> 00:42.417
YOU'VE  GOT
THE EASY PART.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.458
YOU JUST HAVE TO
PICK SOMEONE.

00:44.875 --> 00:46.917
MM-HMM.

00:47.708 --> 00:49.291
IS THAT GONNA
BE A PROBLEM?

00:50.542 --> 00:52.375
NO. I WAS JUST
KIND OF HOPING

00:52.375 --> 00:53.792
TO TAKE A VACATION
FROM LARGE CHOICES

00:53.792 --> 00:55.708
THAT CARRY EVEN
LARGER CONSEQUENCES.

00:55.708 --> 00:56.708

00:56.708 --> 01:00.041
OK. TRY THIS.

01:00.041 --> 01:01.667
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

01:02.875 --> 01:05.083

01:09.000 --> 01:10.041

01:10.041 --> 01:12.792
CLEAR YOUR MIND
OF EVERYTHING.

01:12.792 --> 01:15.542
IT'S JUST AIR
UP THERE.

01:15.542 --> 01:16.792
[CHUCKLES]

01:18.083 --> 01:20.125
OK. NOW PICTURE
THE QUESTION...

01:20.125 --> 01:23.583
WHO IS THE PERSON
THAT KNOWS YOU...

01:23.583 --> 01:26.250
JOEY POTTER...

01:26.250 --> 01:27.625
THE BEST?

01:29.708 --> 01:32.667
OK. OPEN YOUR EYES.

01:33.834 --> 01:36.041
WHO'D YOU SEE?

02:26.333 --> 02:29.250
YOU KNOW, LUGGING YOUR
LITERATURE TO AND FRO

02:29.250 --> 02:30.625
IS GETTING TIRESOME,
McPHEE.

02:30.625 --> 02:32.959
OH, WELL, PARDON ME
IF I'M NOT IN A RUSH

02:32.959 --> 02:34.208
TO HIT
THOSE HIGH SCHOOL HALLS
AND BE STARED AT

02:34.208 --> 02:35.834
LIKE SOME KIND
OF SOCIAL LEPER.

02:35.834 --> 02:38.333
IT WON'T BE LIKE THAT.

02:38.333 --> 02:41.959
OH, COME ON! I MEAN,
CAN'T YOU HEAR IT?

02:41.959 --> 02:43.500
"OOH, THERE'S
THAT REALLY SMART GIRL

02:43.500 --> 02:47.291
WHO ALMOST CHEMED
HERSELF TO DEATH INSIDE
THE INFLATABLE FUN HOUSE."

02:47.291 --> 02:50.959
ANDIE, IF OUR HIGH SCHOOL
DIDN'T HAVE A HISTORY
OF FORGIVING STUPIDITY,

02:50.959 --> 02:53.500
HOW DO YOU THINK
I'D BE ABLE TO WALK
DOWN THE HALLS, HUH?

02:55.250 --> 02:57.291
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS
HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD
ABOUT COMING TO VISIT ME.

02:57.291 --> 03:00.291
BUT, UH, YOU'VE
ALL BEEN ALONE.

03:00.291 --> 03:02.792
NOBODY'S TALKIN'
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT,

03:02.792 --> 03:04.792
AND NO ONE'S TALKING
TO EACH OTHER.

03:04.792 --> 03:09.000
WELL, YEAH, WE'RE
NOT THE MOST HUGGY
OF GROUPS RIGHT NOW.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.708
I MEAN, OUR PREVIOUSLY
FRACTURED CIRCLE OF FRIENDS

03:11.708 --> 03:13.208
HAS JUST GONE AND
FRACTURED ITSELF AGAIN.

03:13.208 --> 03:15.041
YOU MEAN JEN AND JACK.

03:15.041 --> 03:16.583
NO, I MEAN EVERYBODY.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.333
THAT'S RIDICULOUS,
BECAUSE WE ALL TALKED
ABOUT THIS.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.667
WELL, YOU  TALKED
ABOUT IT.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.417
YOU GAVE ME THE WHOLE
"TWO TO TANGO" SPEECH,

03:22.417 --> 03:25.083
BUT SO FAR AS I CAN TELL,
EVERY TANGO NEEDS
SOMEONE TO LEAD.

03:25.083 --> 03:26.667
AND WHY IS EVERYBODY
SO INSISTENT

03:26.667 --> 03:28.500
THAT THAT PERSON
HAS TO BE JEN?

03:28.500 --> 03:31.500
I TOLD YOU.
IT'S NOT HER FAULT.

03:33.125 --> 03:36.125

AHOLD OF HER AND--

WHY?

03:37.500 --> 03:39.375

03:39.375 --> 03:41.625
MAYBE NOT ALL FRIENDSHIPS

03:41.625 --> 03:44.375
MAYBE WE'RE MEANT
TO JUST SPEND

03:44.375 --> 03:47.166
A CERTAIN PART
OF OUR LIVES
WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE

03:47.166 --> 03:48.291
AND THEN MOVE ON.

03:48.291 --> 03:49.333
ISN'T THAT WHAT
THIS WHOLE YEAR

03:49.333 --> 03:50.875
IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT
ANYWAY--MOVIN' ON?

03:52.542 --> 03:57.166
PACEY, WE CAN MOVE ON
WITHOUT MOVING AWAY
FROM EACH OTHER.

03:58.041 --> 04:00.291
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN'T.

YOUR HEAPING PRAISE
FOR A JOB WELL DONE

04:18.291 --> 04:20.708
COULD SWELL
A YOUNG MAN'S HEAD.

04:20.708 --> 04:22.500
2 THINGS
ABOUT THAT STATEMENT
TROUBLE ME, MR. LEERY.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.500
YOU USED THE WORD "WELL"
AND THE WORD "DONE."

04:25.500 --> 04:28.625
"WELL" WOULD IMPLY
THAT YOUR BRUSH STROKES
DON'T STREAK ALL TO HELL,

04:28.625 --> 04:31.417
AND "DONE" WOULD SUGGEST
THAT YOUR WORK HERE'S
COMPLETE,

04:31.417 --> 04:33.875
NEITHER OF WHICH
COULD BE FURTHER
FROM THE TRUTH.

04:35.417 --> 04:37.667

TO COVERING THE COST

04:37.667 --> 04:41.000
TO REPAIR WHAT
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
DID TO MY BOAT.

04:42.166 --> 04:43.667
I UNDERSTAND THAT
FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW

04:43.667 --> 04:44.250
WHAT WE DID WAS--

04:44.250 --> 04:45.834
ILLEGAL.
RIGHT.

04:45.834 --> 04:46.750
BUT, LOOK,

04:46.750 --> 04:48.333
IT WAS A MATTER
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

04:48.333 --> 04:51.583

OF WHITEWASHING MY FENCE?

IT ISN'T GONNA BE
ALL THAT HIGH.

I JUST DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

05:04.208 --> 05:05.625
YOU'RE
A RESOURCEFUL LAD.

05:05.625 --> 05:09.333
AFTER ALL, YOU FOUND
TIME TO STEAL A BOAT
WHEN YOU NEEDED TO.

05:09.333 --> 05:12.458
NOW, IF YOU WANT ME
TO HONOR MY PROMISE
NOT TO PRESS CHARGES,

05:12.458 --> 05:15.625
YOU NEED TO HONOR
YOURS BY WORKIN' OFF
YOUR DEBT. ALL RIGHT?

THAT YOU AND I

05:52.542 --> 05:53.959
HAD COME TO SOME SORT
OF UNDERSTANDING.

05:53.959 --> 05:55.750
AND WHAT UNDERSTANDING
MIGHT THAT BE?

05:55.750 --> 05:57.041
THAT THE BEST THING
THAT YOU COULD DO FOR ME

WITH PLEASURE.

WHAT'S THAT?

08:23.917 --> 08:25.375

THE TEXT. SO SPILL.

08:48.625 --> 08:53.000
OK. I'M ONE RECOMMENDATION
SHORT OF FINISHING

08:55.208 --> 08:56.667
THAT'S GREAT!

08:56.667 --> 08:58.500

THE PUNCH LINE YET.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.917
UM, IT'S A PEER REC
TO BE WRITTEN BY...

09:01.917 --> 09:04.708
"THE PERSON
WHO KNOWS ME BEST."

09:04.708 --> 09:05.708
AH.

09:05.708 --> 09:06.875

WHO?

09:12.250 --> 09:13.792

DAWSON?

09:18.834 --> 09:20.375
WELL, SEE, UH...

IF I ASK DAWSON--
NOT THAT I'M GOING TO--

09:21.375 --> 09:23.417
BUT IF I DO ASK HIM...

09:23.417 --> 09:24.750
WHAT ABOUT PACEY?

09:24.750 --> 09:26.208
EXACTLY.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.875
WHAT ABOUT PACEY?

09:28.875 --> 09:30.708
I MEAN, NO MATTER WHICH
ONE I ASK, SOMEBODY'S
GONNA GET HURT.

BUT THAT PERSON
SHOULDN'T BE YOU
BY DEFAULT.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.792
YOU'VE GOTTA BE
A LITTLE SELFISH HERE.

09:35.792 --> 09:39.375
THEY WANT THE PERSON
WHO KNOWS YOU THE BEST,

09:39.375 --> 09:41.959
NOT THE PERSON YOU
HAPPEN TO BE DATING.

09:41.959 --> 09:43.917
SO YOU'RE SAYING
I SHOULD ASK DAWSON?

09:45.041 --> 09:47.500
I'M SAYING YOU SHOULD
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.125
I--I COULD FLIP
TO SOMETHING ELSE,

10:00.125 --> 10:01.875
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT
ACTUALLY WANT TO WATCH.

10:03.250 --> 10:03.708
I'M PRETTY OBVIOUS,
AREN'T I?

10:06.708 --> 10:10.083

IS, I'M NOT REALLY
WATCHING IT, EITHER.

10:14.792 --> 10:15.750

10:15.750 --> 10:16.875
WHAT IS IT?

10:16.875 --> 10:19.792

I'VE MADE
A LOT OF MISTAKES
WITH THIS FAMILY.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.208
I WANT TO FIX THAT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

10:27.208 --> 10:28.917
I SPOKE
TO PRINCIPAL PESKIN
THIS AFTERNOON.

10:28.917 --> 10:31.708

MORE THAN ENOUGH CREDITS
TO GRADUATE.

AND NOW WITH YOUR
EARLY ACCEPTANCE
TO UNIVERSITY,

10:33.708 --> 10:35.625
ALL THAT YOU
REALLY NEED TO DO
IS WALK COME JUNE.

10:35.625 --> 10:38.917
SO...WHAT
WOULD YOU THINK

10:38.917 --> 10:41.125
ABOUT TAKING THE REST
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR OFF?

10:41.125 --> 10:43.041
TO DO WHAT?

10:43.041 --> 10:44.583
UH, GET A JOB?

10:44.583 --> 10:48.375
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

10:49.125 --> 10:50.834
I WAS TRYING
TO REMEMBER

10:50.834 --> 10:54.458
THE LAST TIME
I SAW YOU RELAX.

10:54.458 --> 10:57.667
NO RESPONSIBILITIES.
NO BURDEN, NO WORRIES.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.959
AND THEN...
I REMEMBERED YOUR FACE

11:00.959 --> 11:05.250
THAT SUMMER IN FLORENCE
WITH, UH, AUNT GEORGIA?

11:05.250 --> 11:06.125
THERE WAS THIS MARKET.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.750
YEAH, IN THAT SQUARE
BY HER FLAT?

11:07.750 --> 11:11.500
I MEAN, YOU WERE RUNNING
FROM CART TO CART...

11:11.500 --> 11:13.708
CHARMING EVERYONE.

11:13.708 --> 11:14.834
COME ON, DAD.
I WAS 11.

11:14.834 --> 11:16.417
IT WAS MORE
THAN THAT, ANDIE.

11:16.417 --> 11:20.125
YOU WERE FREE.

11:20.125 --> 11:23.000
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
I SHOULD GO TO ITALY?

11:23.000 --> 11:26.208
GEORGIA SAYS SHE'D
BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE
SOME COMPANY.

11:26.208 --> 11:28.667
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT SPENDING
TIME IN EUROPE.

11:28.667 --> 11:31.291
UH...I DON'T KNOW
IF I SH--

11:31.291 --> 11:33.417
ANDIE.

11:36.583 --> 11:37.875
THE NEXT 4 YEARS

11:37.875 --> 11:41.834
ARE GONNA BE
EVEN MORE INTENSE
THAN THE LAST 4.

11:41.834 --> 11:42.792
TRUST ME.

11:42.792 --> 11:46.834
THIS MIGHT BE
YOUR ONLY CHANCE...

11:46.834 --> 11:47.917
IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE...

11:49.708 --> 11:51.583
FOR AN OPPORTUNITY
LIKE THIS.

11:55.917 --> 11:57.041
THINK ABOUT IT.

12:11.542 --> 12:13.500
[DISGRUNTLED SIGH]

12:18.458 --> 12:19.959
YOU CAN'T
KEEP AVOIDING HER.

12:19.959 --> 12:20.917
I CAN TRY.

12:22.417 --> 12:24.667
THIS IS  JEN LINDLEY
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.875
I KNOW. AND I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO DO, ANDIE,

12:26.875 --> 12:29.375
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I'M NOT WILLING TO HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.041
OK. SO, DAD WANTS ME
TO TAKE THE REST
OF THE YEAR OFF.

12:34.041 --> 12:35.500
HOW'S THAT
FOR A CONVERSATION?

12:35.500 --> 12:36.625
OH, OFF OF WHAT?

12:36.625 --> 12:37.917
OFF OF EVERYTHING.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.291
I MEAN...

12:42.417 --> 12:44.250
WE HAVEN'T MADE
ANY FINAL DECISIONS YET.

12:44.250 --> 12:47.792
H-HOLD ON. SO YOU GET
ALL THE PERKS OF SENIOR
YEAR AT CAPESIDE

12:47.792 --> 12:49.917
WITH NO HOMEWORK.
WHERE DO I SIGN UP?

12:49.917 --> 12:53.500
ACTUALLY, I WOULDN'T
BE...IN CAPESIDE.

12:54.583 --> 12:57.208
I'D BE IN ITALY.
[CHUCKLES]

12:57.208 --> 12:57.917
IN FLORENCE,
TO BE EXACT.

12:59.708 --> 13:01.875
YOU'D LIVE WITH AUNT G?

13:04.750 --> 13:07.375
WOW. WE HAVEN'T--
WE HAVEN'T SEEN HER
SINCE, UM...

13:07.375 --> 13:09.250
FOREVER. I KNOW.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.250
BUT REMEMBER
HOW MUCH I LOVED IT?

13:11.250 --> 13:14.125
I'M SORRY, ANDIE. IT JUST--
IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'D BE RUNNING AWAY.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.125
FROM WHAT?

13:17.125 --> 13:19.542
YOU TELL ME.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.959
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN
LOOKING FORWARD
TO SENIOR YEAR

13:21.959 --> 13:24.041
WITH ANTICIPATION
THAT OFTEN BORDERS
ON FRIGHTENING,

13:24.041 --> 13:26.250
AND THEN HERE IT IS
AND YOU WANT TO LEAVE.

13:26.250 --> 13:30.041
AND YOU STAY,
AND YOU HAVE 6 MONTHS
OF ZERO RESPONSIBILITY,

13:30.041 --> 13:31.875
SURROUNDED BY FAMILY
AND FRIENDS.

13:31.875 --> 13:33.834
YEAH, FRIENDS
WHO CAN'T EVEN STAND

13:33.834 --> 13:35.250
TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM
WITH ONE ANOTHER.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.166
THAT'S EXACTLY MY POINT.
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO LEAVE

13:38.166 --> 13:39.875
WHEN YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT EVERYONE'S
STILL TALKING TO?

13:39.875 --> 13:44.792
JACK, YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE THERE'S NO VALID
REASON FOR ME TO GO.

13:44.792 --> 13:48.125
YEAH, I ALWAYS
PICTURED YOU
AS THE GIRL...

13:48.125 --> 13:52.625
WHO DIDN'T JUST GO
TO THE LAST PARTY
OF SENIOR YEAR...

13:52.625 --> 13:54.333
BUT THREW IT.

13:55.542 --> 13:59.166
YOU'D LEAVE AND MISS
THE END OF THIS?
ALL OF IT?

14:00.375 --> 14:02.583
THAT'S NOT SOMETHIN'
I THOUGHT YOU'D EVER DO.

14:06.208 --> 14:08.834
BUT THEN AGAIN...
[CHUCKLES]...

14:08.834 --> 14:11.834
I GUESS I'VE BEEN, UH...

14:11.834 --> 14:15.041
MAKIN' THAT MISTAKE
ABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
THESE DAYS.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.542
JEN. THANKS
FOR COMIN' DOWN.

14:29.542 --> 14:30.500
YEAH.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.875
NO PROBLEM.

14:31.875 --> 14:34.500
THIS IS OFFICER MORRIS
FROM JUVENILE CORRECTION.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.125
WHAT'S UP?

14:38.333 --> 14:39.291
I HAD TO TELL THEM.

14:39.291 --> 14:42.500
WE'VE BEEN NAUGHTY,
NAUGHTY KIDS, JEN,

14:42.500 --> 14:43.750
AND FRANKLY,
WE NEED HELP.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.417
DRUE, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

14:46.417 --> 14:47.041
WHAT'S BEST.

14:47.041 --> 14:49.417
I TOLD 'EM ALL ABOUT

14:49.417 --> 14:51.583
OUR MUTUAL EXPERIENCE
WITH ECSTASY....

14:51.583 --> 14:52.583
AND HOW
WE BOTH CONTRIBUTED

14:52.583 --> 14:55.625
TO THE DELINQUENCY
OF POOR ANDIE McPHEE.

14:55.625 --> 14:57.667
HAVE A SEAT, JEN.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.625
LISTEN. YOU CAN'T
BELIEVE A WORD
THAT THIS GUY SAYS.

15:03.625 --> 15:04.708
HE'S JUST--
A VICTIM.

15:04.708 --> 15:08.291
DRUE HAD FINALLY
CLEANED UP HIS ACT.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.792
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO HEAR
MY SIDE OF THE STORY BEFORE
HANDING DOWN A SENTENCE?

15:10.792 --> 15:14.208
IT'S NOT ABOUT
PUNISHMENT, JEN.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.083
IT'S ABOUT
PREVENTION.

15:18.583 --> 15:19.542
ARE YOU GUYS ACTUALLY
BUYING THIS CRAP?

15:19.542 --> 15:21.542
JENNIFER.

15:22.583 --> 15:24.792
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
WE DON'T HAVE A PAST

15:24.792 --> 15:27.083
SPECKLED WITH
RECREATIONAL DRUG
USE?

15:27.083 --> 15:29.417
I'M SAYING THAT
I DON'T HAVE A PRESENT.

15:31.375 --> 15:32.417
GRAMS, PLEASE.
YOU KNOW ME.

15:32.417 --> 15:35.250
ASK.

15:35.250 --> 15:36.250
DRUE: JEN.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.792
I'VE ADMITTED
TO MY PART.
I MEAN...

15:38.792 --> 15:40.667
I ADMIT
THAT I GAVE YOU
THE DRUGS.

15:40.667 --> 15:45.417
AND SOMEHOW THEY GOT
FROM YOUR HANDS TO...
ANDIE'S NERVOUS SYSTEM.

15:45.417 --> 15:46.583
I--I MEAN, DO I FIB?

15:46.583 --> 15:49.458
IF I MAY POINT OUT?

15:49.458 --> 15:50.959
THAT BY COMING
FORWARD WITH
THIS INFORMATION,

15:50.959 --> 15:53.625
MY SON HAS
CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED

15:53.625 --> 15:57.166
THAT HE IS READY TO TACKLE
HIS PAST INDISCRETIONS.

15:57.166 --> 15:58.750
I THINK WE ALL
APPRECIATE

15:58.750 --> 16:01.792
DRUE'S FORTHCOMING
NATURE.

16:01.792 --> 16:04.458
AND...IN RECOGNITION
OF THAT,

16:04.458 --> 16:09.667
I THINK THIS CAN ALL
BE HANDLED WITH 100 HOURS
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.

16:10.875 --> 16:11.083
EXCUSE ME.

16:17.583 --> 16:18.959
WAIT--
SO WE'LL MEET UP
LATER...

16:18.959 --> 16:20.583
DISCUSS WHICH PART
OF THE COMMUNITY

16:20.583 --> 16:21.291
IS MOST IN NEED
OF SERVICING?

16:26.166 --> 16:27.959
SO, DO I START PACKING
MY BAGS IMMEDIATELY,

16:27.959 --> 16:30.875
OR SHOULD I WAIT
UNTIL AFTER DINNER?

16:32.291 --> 16:34.834
GRAMS, WILL YOU
LISTEN TO ME, PLEASE?
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.542
NO. I--I DO NOT...

16:36.542 --> 16:39.583
WANT TO HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION,
JENNIFER.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.000
I THOUGHT WE HAD
A RELATIONSHIP

16:41.000 --> 16:43.583
BASED ON HONESTY
AND TRUTH.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.041
I WILL NOT YELL.
I WILL NOT PUNISH.

16:46.041 --> 16:47.458
SCOLDING
IS FOR CHILDREN,

16:47.458 --> 16:49.500
AND, JENNIFER, YOU
ARE NO LONGER A CHILD.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.583
I WISH TO GOD YOU WERE.
MAYBE THEN THERE'D
STILL BE TIME

16:51.583 --> 16:54.250
TO RIGHT WHATEVER IT IS
THAT'S WRONG WITH YOU.

16:56.291 --> 16:59.166
I HAVE NEVER...
IN ALL MY LIFE...

16:59.166 --> 17:01.834
BEEN SO DEEPLY
DISAPPOINTED

17:01.834 --> 17:04.333
IN ANYTHING
OR ANYONE.

17:05.583 --> 17:06.959
I DON'T EVEN...

17:06.959 --> 17:08.834
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
THE WORDS.

17:24.708 --> 17:26.666
HEY.

17:26.666 --> 17:28.875
I GOT YOUR E-MAIL.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.208
I WAS SURPRISED.
I WASN'T SURE

17:30.208 --> 17:32.208
IF YOU WERE EVER
GONNA WRITE BACK.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.291
I DIDN'T.

17:34.041 --> 17:36.083
WELL, IF YOU DIDN'T,
THEN--

17:36.083 --> 17:36.291
ANDIE.

17:40.291 --> 17:41.625
PROBABLY FIGURED
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY

17:41.625 --> 17:43.542
TO GET THE TWO OF US
TO BREAK OUR CODE
OF SILENCE.

17:43.542 --> 17:47.375
WELL, THAT WOULD
REQUIRE BOTH OF US
WANTING IT BROKEN.

17:47.375 --> 17:50.166
LOOK, I DIDN'T E-MAIL YOU.
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.708
COME ON, JACK,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:52.708 --> 17:54.708
YOU WANT TO JUST
BE ANGRY, FINE.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.667
BUT...I MEAN,
AT SOME POINT,

17:56.667 --> 17:59.542
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TELL ME
HOW TO FIX THIS.

17:59.542 --> 18:01.875
YOU WANT ME
TO SAY "SORRY"?
I HAVE.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.875
I'VE APOLOGIZED
FOR MAKING A MISTAKE...
FOR--FOR POOR JUDGMENT.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.208
I'VE APOLOGIZED FOR THINGS
THAT I DON'T EVEN THINK
WERE REALLY MY FAULT.

18:08.500 --> 18:13.166
I'M 17, AND...I...
I JUST--I DID
SOMETHING STUPID.

18:13.166 --> 18:14.834
BUT WHEN YOU--WHEN
YOU'RE CLOSE TO SOMEBODY

18:14.834 --> 18:19.917
AND THEY DO
SOMETHING UNEXPLAINED
OR OUT OF CHARACTER...

18:19.917 --> 18:21.250
YOU DON'T--YOU
DON'T JUST ABANDON THEM.

18:21.250 --> 18:24.375
YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,
SHOULD UNDERSTAND.

18:24.375 --> 18:27.166
IT'S KILLING ME
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.458
YOU MAY NOT EVER DO
WHAT I DID, BUT WHAT
YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW,

18:29.458 --> 18:32.750
I CAN TELL YOU,
I WOULD NEVER DO
TO ANYBODY,

18:32.750 --> 18:35.083
E-ESPECIALLY YOU.

18:43.417 --> 18:47.250
THERE. WE TALKED.
NOW DO YOU GET IT,
ANDIE?

18:47.250 --> 18:49.792
NOTHIN' YOU CAN DO
IS EVER GONNA FIX THIS.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.125
HEY.

19:16.959 --> 19:18.208
HEY.

19:18.959 --> 19:19.625
NEED SOME HELP
WITH THAT?

19:19.625 --> 19:20.625
YEAH.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.792
YEAH.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.667
SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU DIDN'T COME ALL
THE WAY OVER HERE

19:28.667 --> 19:30.333
JUST TO HELP ME
CARRY PAINT, SO...

19:30.333 --> 19:33.333
DID YOU FINALLY
REALIZE HOW WRONG IT IS

19:33.333 --> 19:36.667
I'VE BEEN WORKING OFF
OUR DEBT TO MR. BROOKS
ALL BY MYSELF?

19:36.667 --> 19:38.500
ME AND MY YACHT CLUB
EMPLOYMENT ARE FOREVER
IN YOUR DEBT, DAWSON.

19:38.500 --> 19:42.041
RIGHT. RIGHT.
I'LL PUT IT
ON YOUR TAB.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.625
SO, UM...

19:52.166 --> 19:54.458
ARE YOU...GONNA ASK ME?

19:54.458 --> 19:55.291
ASK WHAT?

19:55.291 --> 19:57.667
YOU'VE GOT
YOUR FAVOR FACE ON.

19:57.667 --> 20:00.083
I DO NOT.

20:00.083 --> 20:02.959
OH, NOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR
"I'M LYING" FACE ON.

20:04.875 --> 20:07.250
OK. UM...

IT'S, UH...

20:13.291 --> 20:14.458

WHO KNOWS YOU BEST."

20:20.875 --> 20:22.500
WOW.

20:24.542 --> 20:25.708
WOW.

20:26.875 --> 20:28.041
YOU SAID THAT ALREADY.

20:28.041 --> 20:30.417
YEAH. I...

20:30.417 --> 20:32.959
THOUGHT IT HAD MORE
IMPACT THE SECOND TIME.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.500
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:37.917 --> 20:39.375
WHAT DO YOU  THINK?

20:39.375 --> 20:42.875
I THINK THAT...
I WANT YOU TO SAY THAT
YOU'LL WRITE IT FOR ME.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.875
ARE YOU SURE THAT
I'M THE RIGHT PERSON?

20:44.875 --> 20:48.166
I MEAN, DOES PACEY
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

20:48.166 --> 20:52.417
NO. UH...BUT IF
YOU SAY YES, HE WILL.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.375
ARE YOU THE RIGHT
PERSON, DAWSON? WELL,

20:55.375 --> 20:58.500
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
WHO KNOWS THAT I HAVE
A FAVOR FACE.

20:58.500 --> 21:02.125
I'M JUST ASKING
THAT YOU PONDER
THE POSSIBILITY, OK?

21:02.125 --> 21:04.458
AND...IF YOU DO DECIDE
TO WRITE IT, THEN...

21:06.166 --> 21:08.208
YOU'RE THE RIGHT PERSON.

21:11.458 --> 21:12.417
OK.

21:42.750 --> 21:45.875
MR. LEERY! UNLESS
YOU'D LIKE TO STARVE
TO DEATH,

21:45.875 --> 21:46.542
YOU BETTER
GET IN HERE!

21:59.917 --> 22:02.333
FOOD'S IN HERE!

22:02.333 --> 22:02.542
[SIGHS]

22:13.625 --> 22:14.458
MR. BROOKS, THIS
IS REALLY GOOD.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.667
OH, YOU'RE NOT
ONE OF THEM.

22:17.667 --> 22:18.750
ONE OF WHO?

22:18.750 --> 22:21.875
ONE OF THOSE TEENAGERS
WHO CAN'T STAND A MOMENT

22:21.875 --> 22:22.917
OF GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
SILENCE.

22:22.917 --> 22:25.083
IF THE DINNER TABLE
WAS MEANT FOR TALKING,

22:25.083 --> 22:28.041
THEY'D CALL IT
THE TALKING TABLE.

22:28.041 --> 22:29.834
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS
OUTSIDE.

22:29.834 --> 22:31.667
OH, YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S WHY YOUR FRIENDS

22:31.667 --> 22:33.250
NEVER COME OVER HERE
AND HELP YOU.

22:33.250 --> 22:36.375
YOU DON'T FACE
YOUR ISSUES, LEERY. YOU
JUST TAKE 'EM OUTSIDE.

22:36.375 --> 22:37.917
YOU KEEP DOIN' THAT,
YOU'RE GONNA END UP

22:37.917 --> 22:41.500
DOIN' A HELL
OF A LOT MORE THAN
JUST PAINTING ALONE.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.750
[SNICKERS]

22:43.750 --> 22:45.166
WELL,
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

22:45.166 --> 22:47.166
YOU GOT
A WHOLE WALL FULL
OF PHOTOGRAPHS,

22:47.166 --> 22:49.333
FULL OF PEOPLE WHO
I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

22:49.333 --> 22:51.625
WHO--WHO ARE THEY?
YOU ONCE CRITIQUED
MY PHOTOGRAPHY,

22:51.625 --> 22:53.959
SAYING I DIDN'T
HAVE ENOUGH LIFE
IN MY PICTURES.

22:53.959 --> 22:56.000
I WOULD SAY YOU'VE
GOT THE OPPOSITE
PROBLEM.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.583
WHERE ARE THESE PICTURES
IN YOUR LIFE?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.250
MY BROTHERS.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.041
30 YEARS AGO,
THEY CAME TO ME

23:04.041 --> 23:05.667
ASKING FOR MONEY
TO START
THEIR OWN BUSINESS.

23:05.667 --> 23:09.291
MY GUT
WAS SCREAMING NO.
DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.

23:09.291 --> 23:11.375
TIMING WAS NOT
THE BEST, BUT
THEY NEEDED ME.

23:11.375 --> 23:14.417
AND EVEN THOUGH
YOUR GUT SAID NO...

23:14.417 --> 23:18.250
I INVESTED A LOT.
THE BUSINESS LOST A LOT,
AND SO DID I.

23:18.250 --> 23:21.291
AS YOU TAKE ON YEARS,
MR. LEERY, YOU'LL
COME TO REALIZE

23:21.291 --> 23:25.375
THAT YOU DON'T
ALWAYS LOSE PEOPLE
FROM YOUR LIFE BY CHOICE.

23:25.375 --> 23:27.500
SOMETIMES IT, UH...
JUST HAPPENS...

23:29.583 --> 23:31.500
WHEN YOU MAKE
THE WRONG ONES.

23:33.667 --> 23:34.708
[CHUCKLES]
HUH.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.083
[KNOCK KNOCK]

23:39.083 --> 23:40.417
HEY!

23:40.417 --> 23:43.917
HEY. I GOT
SOME A.P. ENGLISH HERE
WITH A SIDE OF CALC.

23:43.917 --> 23:45.917
OOH. THANKS.
[CHUCKLES]

23:45.917 --> 23:47.417
UH...

23:48.542 --> 23:49.750
PACEY...

23:49.750 --> 23:50.917
NGGGHH!

23:50.917 --> 23:52.542
I HAVE A SECRET.

23:52.542 --> 23:56.417
AND...I KNOW THAT
WE HAVEN'T SHARED ONE
OF THESE IN A LONG TIME,

23:56.417 --> 24:00.250
BUT...I REALLY NEED
TO TELL YOU,
OR I'M GONNA BURST.

24:00.250 --> 24:02.083
SURE THING...
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

24:02.083 --> 24:03.750
OK. UM...

24:03.750 --> 24:07.333
MY DAD SUGGESTED
THAT I TAKE THE REST
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR OFF.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.250
YEAH.

24:09.250 --> 24:11.041
THAT I GO TO ITALY
FOR 6 MONTHS

24:11.041 --> 24:13.375
AND SEE MY AUNT.

24:13.375 --> 24:16.625
WELL, THAT'S...
QUITE AN OFFER.

24:16.625 --> 24:18.375
YEAH.

24:18.375 --> 24:21.000
AND I KNOW
WHY HE'S MAKING IT.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,
BECAUSE OF LAST WEEK,
HE'S WORRIED, BUT...

24:25.000 --> 24:26.708
ALSO WE TALKED
ABOUT IT.

24:26.708 --> 24:31.166
YOU KNOW? I MEAN
WE REALLY TALKED
ABOUT THIS, AND...

24:31.166 --> 24:33.458
IT'S JUST DIFFERENT
THIS TIME.

24:33.458 --> 24:36.625
SO, WHAT DOES
JACK HAVE TO SAY
ABOUT ALL THIS?

24:36.625 --> 24:39.542
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA BE
THE FIRST ONE TO VOLUNTEER
TO HELP ME PACK UP. RIGHT?

24:39.542 --> 24:43.000
BUT INSTEAD, HE...
HE GIVES ME ALL THESE
SOUND ARGUMENTS

24:43.000 --> 24:44.959
AND REASONS
FOR WHY I SHOULD STAY.

24:44.959 --> 24:46.250
YOU KNOW,
HE LEFT ONCE, TOO.

24:46.250 --> 24:50.250
YEAH, BUT HE MOVED
ACROSS TOWN,
NOT ACROSS THE WORLD.

24:51.708 --> 24:53.625
SO MY FATHER WANTS
WHAT'S BEST FOR MY HEALTH,

24:53.625 --> 24:57.917
MY BROTHER IS BEING
SELFISH OUT OF LOVE.

24:57.917 --> 24:59.959
AND YOU WANT
A TIEBREAKER.

24:59.959 --> 25:02.250
COME ON, PACEY.
YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.875
IN FACT,
YOU ALMOST MADE A HOBBY

25:03.875 --> 25:05.959
OUT OF SAVING
THIS DAMSEL IN DISTRESS.

25:05.959 --> 25:08.417
I DIDN'T SAVE YOU.
YOU SAVED YOURSELF.

25:08.417 --> 25:09.667
YOU JUST TOOK ME
ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

25:09.667 --> 25:10.750
WELL, THEN WHY CAN'T I
SAVE MYSELF NOW?

25:10.750 --> 25:15.083
WHY IS MAKING
THIS DECISION SO HARD?

25:15.083 --> 25:16.959
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE JACK IS RIGHT.

25:16.959 --> 25:19.208
MAYBE GOING TO ITALY
IS RUNNING AWAY.

25:19.208 --> 25:20.250
FROM WHAT?

25:20.250 --> 25:22.000
FROM EVERYTHING!

25:22.000 --> 25:26.125
TAKING THE EASY WAY OUT.
PACKING UP WHEN LIFE
HITS A ROUGH PATCH.

25:26.125 --> 25:29.583
OR...MAYBE THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED...

25:29.583 --> 25:31.667
TO HAVE THE STRENGTH,
THE WILL, TO TAKE OFF
THE TRAINING WHEELS

25:31.667 --> 25:34.625
AND...TRY RIDING
ON YOUR OWN FOR A WHILE.

25:37.375 --> 25:40.250
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THAT, PACEY.

25:40.250 --> 25:43.125
I MEAN, A LOT
OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
IS BECAUSE OF ME.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.208
AND WHAT ARE PEOPLE
GONNA THINK IF--
ANDIE.

25:44.208 --> 25:46.625
YOU CAN.

25:47.542 --> 25:48.959
YOU SPEND
WAY TOO MUCH TIME

25:48.959 --> 25:50.750
WORRYIN' ABOUT
EVERYBODY ELSE.
WE ALL DO.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.375
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
IT'S YOUR LIFE.

25:53.375 --> 25:55.792
IT'S NOT YOUR DAD'S,
IT'S NOT JACK'S,
IT'S NOT MINE.

25:55.792 --> 25:58.083
IT'S YOURS, AND
YOU GET TO LIVE IT.

25:59.583 --> 26:01.542
SO YOU'RE
THE TIEBREAKER, ANDIE.

26:06.875 --> 26:10.041
HEY. WE CAN HELP
BUILD A NEW COMMUNITY
CENTER FOR KIDS.

26:10.041 --> 26:10.792
JUST SHUT UP, DRUE.

26:12.583 --> 26:13.583
JENNY...

26:13.583 --> 26:15.667
THIS LITTLE RIFT OF OURS
TROUBLES ME SO.

26:15.667 --> 26:16.959
I MEAN, I FELT THAT WE
WERE GROWING APART,

26:16.959 --> 26:19.875
AND WE NEED TO SPEND
SOME QUALITY TIME
TOGETHER.

26:19.875 --> 26:22.041
AND I COULD ONLY HELP
BUT DREAM OF US

26:22.041 --> 26:25.083
PICKIN' UP
PIECES OF TRASH
ON THE ROADSIDE

26:25.083 --> 26:26.667
AND HOW
THAT CITY-PROVIDED
ORANGE JUMPSUIT

26:26.667 --> 26:30.375
WOULD JUST HUG YOU
IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES.

26:30.375 --> 26:31.917
DRUE, YOU FORGET
THAT I KNOW YOU.

26:31.917 --> 26:34.417
YOU DID THIS
TO LOOK BETTER
TO EVERYBODY ELSE,

26:34.417 --> 26:36.083
TO PROTECT
THAT INNER IAGO OF YOURS.

26:36.083 --> 26:38.583
BUT I THINK THAT YOU'LL
FIND THAT NO AMOUNT
OF APOLOGIZING

26:38.583 --> 26:39.917
IS GOOD ENOUGH
FOR THESE PEOPLE

26:39.917 --> 26:42.917
ONCE THEY'VE
MADE UP THEIR MINDS
ABOUT WHO YOU ARE.

26:42.917 --> 26:44.834
THESE PEOPLE
HAVE NO IDEA
WHO WE ARE, JEN.

26:44.834 --> 26:47.417
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN
TRYIN' TO TELL YOU.

26:47.417 --> 26:49.875
THESE ARE NOT YOUR PEOPLE.
I AM YOUR PEOPLE.

26:49.875 --> 26:54.083
AND ALL THAT CAPESIDE
WILL EVER BE FOR YOU...

26:54.083 --> 26:55.500
IS YOUR PAST.

27:00.667 --> 27:01.667
HEY.

27:01.667 --> 27:02.875
HEY.

27:02.875 --> 27:04.625
OH, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE GETTING
YOUR COLOR BACK.

27:04.625 --> 27:05.875
YEAH, I THINK I AM.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.250
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE

27:08.250 --> 27:10.250
GOING OK AROUND HERE
NOW, HUH?

27:10.250 --> 27:11.375
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

27:11.375 --> 27:14.000
LIKE...YOU AND JACK.

27:14.000 --> 27:14.834
THINGS ARE...

27:14.834 --> 27:17.250
OK BETWEEN YOU GUYS
NOW, HUH?

27:17.250 --> 27:18.625
YEAH.

27:19.375 --> 27:20.625
YEAH, THEY ARE.

27:21.834 --> 27:23.792
I MEAN...
IF YOU AND JACK
CAN WORK THINGS OUT,

27:23.792 --> 27:27.291
THEN...WHY CAN'T
JEN AND JACK, RIGHT?

27:27.291 --> 27:29.417
OR PACEY AND DAWSON,
OR ANY OF US, REALLY?

27:29.417 --> 27:31.125
WELL, ALL IT TAKES

27:31.125 --> 27:36.917
IS REALIZING
WHAT YOU RISK LOSING
BY LETTING SOMEONE GO.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.125
HEY.

27:50.125 --> 27:52.166
HEY.

27:52.166 --> 27:54.125
PLOWING THROUGH
TONIGHT'S READING,
AS PER USUAL.

27:54.125 --> 27:55.542
TRY LAST NIGHT'S.

27:55.542 --> 27:58.083
I THOUGHT I'D CATCH UP.
BUT MR. COPELAND
IN ROOM 3,

27:58.083 --> 28:00.417
HE HAS A TENDENCY
TO BREAK OUT IN SONG
WHILE BATHING.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.250
[CHUCKLES]

28:02.959 --> 28:03.834
THIS SEAT'S NOT TAKEN.

28:03.834 --> 28:07.083
UH, IT'S OK.
I CAN'T STAY.

28:07.083 --> 28:08.291
UM...

28:11.375 --> 28:12.583
UM...

28:14.208 --> 28:17.667
WELL...

28:17.667 --> 28:20.500
EITHER YOU'RE
A VERY FAST WRITER, WHICH
I KNOW NOT TO BE THE CASE,

28:20.500 --> 28:22.000
OR...

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
YOU COME BEARING BAD NEWS.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.250
I JUST--I BE--
I'VE...BEEN...

28:26.250 --> 28:27.834
[SIGHS]

28:27.834 --> 28:31.000
THINKING ABOUT IT SINCE
THE MINUTE YOU ASKED ME,
AND...

28:31.000 --> 28:33.625
THE ANSWER JUST KEEPS ON
COMING BACK THE SAME.

28:33.625 --> 28:36.250
I'M NOT THE RIGHT PERSON...

28:36.250 --> 28:37.417
TO WRITE THIS.

28:37.417 --> 28:39.625
NOT ANYMORE.

28:46.500 --> 28:49.708
YOU DID WHAT I ASKED.
YOU, UM...

28:50.542 --> 28:52.708
YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
AND...

28:54.208 --> 28:55.375
I THANK YOU FOR THAT.

28:55.375 --> 28:57.625
SORRY.

29:00.542 --> 29:01.750
OK.

29:06.708 --> 29:07.708
PACEY.

29:07.708 --> 29:09.625
DAWSON.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.208
SO.

29:14.208 --> 29:15.792
PLAY DATE?

29:15.792 --> 29:17.375
LOOK, NOT EXACTLY.
UH...

29:17.375 --> 29:21.417
PACE, I ASKED DAWSON
TO WRITE A PEER
RECOMMENDATION FOR ME.

29:21.417 --> 29:23.667
HE SAID NO,
SO IT'S REALLY NOTHING.

29:25.625 --> 29:27.083
WELL, THAT'S
NOT NOTHING.

29:28.792 --> 29:30.917
THE NOTHINGS
YOU TELL ME ABOUT.

29:30.917 --> 29:32.417
IT'S THE SOMETHINGS
THAT YOU KEEP SECRET.

29:32.417 --> 29:35.000
I KNOW THIS TONE,
AND IT SIGNIFIES
THE START

29:35.000 --> 29:36.917
OF A REALLY NASTY
CONVERSATION,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:36.917 --> 29:39.125
IT TAKES TWO TO HAVE ONE,
AND I'M NOT UP FOR SPARRING.

29:39.125 --> 29:39.959
NOT OVER THIS.

29:39.959 --> 29:41.834
AH. SO. NOW YOU
GET TO DECIDE

29:41.834 --> 29:43.417
WHAT IT IS THAT
WE TALK THROUGH,

29:43.417 --> 29:46.208
BUT YOU ALSO GET
TO DECIDE WHAT IT IS
THAT WE LET SLIDE, HUH?

29:46.208 --> 29:47.625
WERE YOU EVER GONNA
TELL ME ABOUT THIS?

29:47.625 --> 29:49.708
IT'S BEEN HARD TO TELL YOU
MUCH OF ANYTHING THIS WEEK.

29:49.708 --> 29:51.166
YOU'RE NEVER AROUND.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.417
OK. LOOK. [CHUCKLES]

29:53.417 --> 29:55.041
IF YOU'RE ANGRY WITH ME
FOR HOW MUCH TIME

29:55.041 --> 29:57.041
I WAS SPENDING
WITH ANDIE--
LOOK. PACEY--

29:58.375 --> 30:01.792
THAT'S NOT IT. OK?
I WAS JUST WAITING TO SEE

30:01.792 --> 30:03.166
IF HE'D AGREE TO DO IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE

30:03.166 --> 30:06.667
BEFORE WORLD WAR--
WHERE ARE WE NOW? 15?

30:08.792 --> 30:11.083
AND IF YOU'RE UPSET
THAT I ASKED HIM, PACEY...

30:12.208 --> 30:14.500
IT'S BECAUSE
IT WAS THE QUESTION.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.125
YOU KNOW, THIRD GRADE,
DAWSON WAS THERE

30:22.125 --> 30:26.166
WHEN I BROKE MY LEFT ARM
JUMPING OFF PETER MASIK'S
BACKYARD SWING.

30:26.166 --> 30:28.083
HE WAS THERE THE NIGHT
I CAME HOME EARLY

30:28.083 --> 30:29.959
FROM LAKE EMANDAL
BECAUSE I WAS HOMESICK.

30:29.959 --> 30:33.458
AND HE WAS THERE THE DAY
THAT I HAD TO WEAR

30:33.458 --> 30:35.792
THAT HORRIFIC TRAINING BRA
FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND...

30:35.792 --> 30:40.250
THE DAY THAT MY MOM
PASSED AWAY,

30:40.250 --> 30:42.583
YOU KNOW, HE WAS
THE FIRST ONE TO COME
THROUGH THE DOOR,

30:42.583 --> 30:44.166
AND HE SAT WITH ME
THE WHOLE DAY,

30:44.166 --> 30:47.083
AND HE NEVER ONCE
ASKED ME HOW I WAS DOING

30:47.083 --> 30:50.125
BECAUSE HE,
UNLIKE EVERYONE ELSE,
HE KNEW ME WELL ENOUGH

30:50.125 --> 30:53.250
TO KNOW THAT THERE WEREN'T
WORDS TO DESCRIBE
HOW I WAS DOING.

30:58.834 --> 31:00.875
SO YOU...REALLY, PACE...

31:03.333 --> 31:06.291
YOU CAN'T BE
ANGRY WITH ME
FOR ASKING HIM.

31:07.750 --> 31:11.208
I'M NOT ANGRY
THAT YOU ASKED DAWSON
TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU.

31:11.208 --> 31:12.500
IT'S THE QUESTION.

31:13.333 --> 31:15.875
"THE PERSON
WHO KNOWS YOU BEST."

31:17.834 --> 31:21.166
WHEN DO I GET TO BE
THAT PERSON?

31:33.500 --> 31:35.166
DAWSON?

31:35.166 --> 31:38.083
YOU LOOK PRETTY SWANK
FOR FISH DUTY TONIGHT.

31:38.083 --> 31:39.708
UH...THANK YOU.

31:39.708 --> 31:42.083
DID YOUR MOM
ENLIST YOUR SERVICES
FOR THIS EVENING?

31:42.083 --> 31:43.792
NO. ACTUALLY,
I'M A PAYING CUSTOMER
TONIGHT.

31:43.792 --> 31:45.291
I'M HAVING DINNER WITH ANDIE.

31:46.291 --> 31:47.333
THAT'S STRANGE,
'CAUSE...

31:47.333 --> 31:48.917
I'M  HAVING DINNER
WITH ANDIE.

31:50.375 --> 31:51.333
REALLY.

31:52.875 --> 31:53.708
HEY, GUYS.

31:53.708 --> 31:54.750
LET ME GUESS.
DINNER WITH ANDIE?

31:54.750 --> 31:56.750
YEAH.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

31:56.750 --> 31:58.083
[CHUCKLES
UNCERTAINLY]

32:04.250 --> 32:05.208
PACEY.

32:05.750 --> 32:06.500
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

32:06.500 --> 32:08.458
WHERE'S ANDIE?

32:08.458 --> 32:09.875
SHE'S IN THE BATHROOM

32:09.875 --> 32:10.917
PERFECTING THE ANSWER
TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION.

32:10.917 --> 32:12.875
WH-WHAT'S THIS
ALL ABOUT?

32:12.875 --> 32:14.667
I DON'T KNOW.
DON'T SHOOT THE DINER.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.417
I'M A GUEST,
JUST LIKE YOU.

32:18.417 --> 32:20.583
HEY, GUYS.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.250
THANKS FOR COMING.

32:22.250 --> 32:25.458
SO...NOW THAT
WE'RE ALL HERE,
WHY ARE WE HERE?

32:25.458 --> 32:26.375
YOU'LL FIND OUT SHORTLY.

32:26.375 --> 32:28.834
WE'RE JUST WAITING
FOR ONE PERSON.

32:28.834 --> 32:30.000
ANDIE, COME ON,
THIS IS...[CHUCKLES]

32:30.000 --> 32:32.041
OH, WAIT.
HERE SHE IS.
HEY, JEN.

32:32.041 --> 32:34.083
HI.
WE SAVED A SEAT
FOR YOU.

32:35.500 --> 32:38.542
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M, UH...
I'M NOT THAT HUNGRY.

32:38.542 --> 32:40.458
ANDIE, CAN YOU
BRING ME HOME
A DOGGIE BAG?

32:40.458 --> 32:42.417
IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT I'M THE ONE
CRASHING THE PARTY.

32:42.417 --> 32:43.792
I'LL GO.
I JUST SAID
I WAS GOIN'.

32:43.792 --> 32:45.500
NO. I AM.

32:46.208 --> 32:49.917
I'M LEAVING CAPESIDE.

32:49.917 --> 32:55.166
AND, UH...THAT'S
WHY I ASKED YOU ALL
TO COME HERE TONIGHT...

32:55.166 --> 32:56.125
TO SAY GOOD-BYE,

32:56.125 --> 32:57.208
AND ALSO
THERE'S SOMETHING

32:57.208 --> 32:57.959
THAT I NEED TO SAY
TO YOU GUYS...

32:57.959 --> 33:00.834
ALL OF YOU,
BEFORE I GO.

33:00.834 --> 33:02.708
SO...SO,

33:02.708 --> 33:04.792
JEN, JACK, PLEASE STAY.

33:15.667 --> 33:17.750
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN A SCHEME

33:17.750 --> 33:19.792
TO GET YOU ALL
HERE TONIGHT.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.542
WHEN MY DAD
FIRST MADE ME THE OFFER

33:24.542 --> 33:25.542
TO TAKE THE REST
OF THE YEAR OFF,

33:25.542 --> 33:29.041
I SAT DOWN
WITH MY TRUSTY
NUMBER 2...

33:29.041 --> 33:33.375
[CHUCKLING]
AND MADE MY LIST
OF PROS AND CONS.

33:33.375 --> 33:35.000
THE PROS
WERE PRETTY OBVIOUS.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.834
OPPORTUNITY
OF A LIFETIME,
RIGHT?

33:38.792 --> 33:42.417
AND THEN CAME
THOSE NASTY CONS.

33:43.708 --> 33:46.000
YOU KNOW WHAT GOT
TOP BILLING?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.166
YOU GUYS.

33:47.166 --> 33:50.208
THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING
ALL OF MY FRIENDS...

33:51.333 --> 33:52.166
I MEAN, YOU GUYS
ARE THE ONES

33:52.166 --> 33:55.667
WHO HAVE SUPPORTED
AND CONSOLED

33:55.667 --> 33:58.750
AND...UNDERSTOOD,
UNCONDITIONALLY.

33:59.667 --> 34:03.166
BUT LOOK AT US NOW.
WE ARE A MESS.

34:03.166 --> 34:06.291
AND LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY,
STARTING WITH LAST WEEK'S
FIASCO.

34:06.291 --> 34:08.833
OK, ENOUGH WITH
THE BLAME JEN GAME.

34:08.833 --> 34:12.625
IF I DON'T, YOU SHOULDN'T.

34:12.625 --> 34:15.583
YES, SHE HAD THEM.
BUT I  TOOK THEM.

34:15.583 --> 34:17.000
IT WAS MY FAULT.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.542
AND PACEY, JOEY, DAWSON...

34:20.542 --> 34:23.458
YOU GUYS ARE SO LUCKY.

34:23.458 --> 34:26.458
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW RARE IT IS

34:26.458 --> 34:30.041
TO HAVE FRIENDS
THAT YOU'VE KNOWN
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE?

34:30.041 --> 34:33.375
SO PLEASE DON'T
UNDERESTIMATE THAT.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.333
BECAUSE IN THE END,
YOU ALWAYS GO BACK

34:35.333 --> 34:37.417
TO THE PEOPLE
THAT WERE THERE
IN THE BEGINNING.

34:37.417 --> 34:40.250
AND IN THE BEGINNING,
THERE WERE THE THREE OF YOU.

34:46.375 --> 34:47.750
AND...YOU TWO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:47.750 --> 34:49.333
THIS IS JUST...

34:51.250 --> 34:53.625
IT'S REALLY INEXCUSABLE.

34:54.208 --> 34:56.291
THE BIGGEST REASON

34:56.291 --> 34:58.041
THAT WAS KEEPING ME HERE

34:58.041 --> 35:00.417
WAS THE THOUGHT
THAT IF I LEFT,

35:00.417 --> 35:03.083
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
A SISTER AROUND.

35:03.083 --> 35:06.291
BUT THEN I REALIZED
THAT YOU WOULD.

35:09.083 --> 35:12.333
WHEN I, UH...
FIRST MET YOU...

35:13.375 --> 35:14.750
I DIDN'T KNOW
MUCH ABOUT LOVE...

35:14.750 --> 35:17.166
OR FRIENDSHIP.

35:18.583 --> 35:21.375
AND EACH OF YOU
TAUGHT ME A LOT
ABOUT BOTH.

35:23.417 --> 35:29.041
SO MAYBE BY MY LEAVING
I CAN RETURN THE FAVOR.

35:29.041 --> 35:32.625
BECAUSE THE THOUGHT
OF IT ENDING LIKE THIS...

35:32.625 --> 35:33.458
[ANDIE SNIFFLES]

35:33.458 --> 35:36.250
THE WAY THINGS ARE
RIGHT NOW...

35:38.041 --> 35:39.417
IT'S JUST...

35:39.417 --> 35:42.583
IT'S NOT HOW I WANT
TO REMEMBER US.

35:44.792 --> 35:46.208
DO YOU?

35:49.542 --> 35:50.875
[ANDIE SNIFFLES]

36:09.834 --> 36:11.417
[KNOCK KNOCK]

36:14.000 --> 36:15.500
IS ANYBODY IN THERE?

36:15.500 --> 36:18.166
UH, YEAH.
AND THERE'S ONLY ROOM
FOR ONE.

36:18.166 --> 36:19.500
OH.

36:19.500 --> 36:22.834
WHICH, I GUESS,
IS KIND OF A RECURRING
THEME THESE DAYS.

36:24.333 --> 36:26.500
[SIGHS] PACE,
I'M REALLY SORRY--

36:26.500 --> 36:27.667
HOLD ON A SECOND.
LET ME GO FIRST
THIS TIME.

36:27.667 --> 36:30.208
[CHUCKLES]

36:30.208 --> 36:33.834
OHHH...JO, I'M SORRY
FOR HOW I REACTED TO
THE WHOLE PEER REC THING.

36:34.917 --> 36:36.583
I THINK IT WAS JUST
KIND OF A LEFT HOOK

36:36.583 --> 36:37.834
TO THE HOT BUTTON,
AND...

36:37.834 --> 36:40.542
I REACTED...

36:40.542 --> 36:42.625
LIKE PACEY.

36:43.667 --> 36:45.166
YOU KNOW WHO THAT GUY
YOU REACTED LIKE

36:45.166 --> 36:46.625
IS GONNA BE
IN 10 YEARS, PACE?

36:48.792 --> 36:51.208
THE PERSON
WHO KNOWS ME BEST.

36:53.375 --> 36:55.208
DAWSON KNOWS MY PAST.

36:57.542 --> 36:59.500
MY FUTURE LIES WITH YOU.

37:01.375 --> 37:03.458
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
YOU KNOW,

37:03.458 --> 37:05.875
YOU DIDN'T EVEN LIKE ME
A FEW YEARS AGO.

37:05.875 --> 37:08.375
WELL, YOU ALWAYS TEASE
THE ONES YOU LOVE.

37:11.917 --> 37:13.291
AND YOU DO ALWAYS
HAVE TO DEAL

37:13.291 --> 37:14.500
WITH THE ONES THAT
YOU USED TO LOVE.

37:29.750 --> 37:31.208
[PACEY SIGHS]

37:34.667 --> 37:36.667
HEY.

37:36.667 --> 37:37.625

IS THAT THE GIRL

37:44.291 --> 37:46.250
THAT USED TO
TELL ME EVERYTHING?

37:47.750 --> 37:50.041
IS THAT THE BOY
WHO USED TO LISTEN?

37:52.083 --> 37:54.625
I NEVER STOPPED
LISTENING, JEN.
I--I JUST...

37:55.917 --> 37:57.458
DIDN'T PARTICULARLY LIKE
WHAT I WAS HEARING.

37:58.625 --> 38:01.458
LOOK, WHAT--
WHAT ANDIE SAID IN THERE,
UM...

38:04.250 --> 38:08.166
YOU--YOU ARE
SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART
OF MY LIFE, AND I...

38:09.250 --> 38:10.458
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU
WERE CHANGIN' ON ME.

38:10.458 --> 38:12.291
I HAVEN'T CHANGED, JACK.

A GIRL WHO SCREWS UP
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN.

38:22.917 --> 38:24.875
I'M SORRY.

38:25.542 --> 38:28.125
I DON'T NEED AN APOLOGY.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.917
I JUST NEED SOMEBODY
WHO'LL STAND BY ME.

38:50.458 --> 38:51.542
I KNEW
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.750
THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
KNOW ME ANYMORE, DAWSON.

39:01.750 --> 39:04.750
THE TRUTH IS,
I NEVER DOUBTED HOW
WELL I KNEW YOU, JOEY.

39:07.291 --> 39:08.667
I WAS JUST AFRAID
OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

39:08.667 --> 39:10.708
IF I HAD TO PUT IT
ALL DOWN ON PAPER.

39:13.208 --> 39:15.750
BEFORE, YOU TOLD ME...

39:17.417 --> 39:20.041
THAT, IF
I DECIDED TO WRITE
THE RECOMMENDATION,

39:20.041 --> 39:21.959
THAT I WAS THE RIGHT
PERSON FOR THE JOB.

39:24.333 --> 39:28.291
IF THE OFFER STILL STANDS,
I WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO DO THAT FOR YOU.

TO HOLD ONTO.

BE THE LAST TIME--

OH, DON'T SAY THAT.

FOR THAT.

AND THERE'S
GRADUATION.

AND A WHOLE
'NOTHER WORLD OUT THERE.

40:14.875 --> 40:16.542

SAID IT YOURSELF.

40:16.542 --> 40:18.708
IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE DOIN' THIS?

THE STRENGTH
TO DO THINGS

40:33.750 --> 40:36.125
THAT I ALWAYS
NEEDED TO DO, BUT
WAS TOO AFRAID TO DO.

40:38.708 --> 40:40.166
NO. I'M SORRY.
I DON'T THINK

40:40.166 --> 40:43.083
THAT YOU GET TO USE
THE ADJECTIVE "AFRAID"
ANYMORE WHILE BEING

40:43.083 --> 40:45.083
SELF-REFERENTIAL.

40:46.125 --> 40:48.083
YOU CAN NOW USE
"BRAVE"

40:48.083 --> 40:52.291
AND PERHAPS
OCCASIONALLY
"STALWART."

40:52.291 --> 40:54.792
"STALWART." NO.

WHAT WE'RE GONNA MISS

OVERWHELMING OPTIMISM...

IS WONDERFUL UNTIL PROVEN CRAP.

DO YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU COULD JUST...

41:17.792 --> 41:20.625
LEAVE US A LITTLE BIT
OF THAT WHEN YOU GO?

41:20.625 --> 41:22.500

THE ONLY REASON THAT I SAID
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T GO

IS 'CAUSE...
