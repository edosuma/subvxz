I'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT TO THE DOOR.
DON'T BE SILLY.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.414
- JUST HERE!
- I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO GO NIGHTCLUBBING.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.915
YOU'VE GOT TO GO
NIGHTCLUBBING, BRET.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.684
LOOK AT JEMAINE.
HE WANTS TO NIGHTCLUB.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.119
CAN WE WATCH
A VIDEO INSTEAD?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.653
YEAH, I WANT TO GO HOME
AND HAVE A SLEEP.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.156
- JUST HERE IS GOOD.
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING
OUT OF IT AGAIN.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.558
- Jemaine: KEEP GOING.
- Murray: HERE WE GO.
I JUST WANT YOU TO GO INSIDE.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.495
LISTEN TO
THE MUSIC THEY PLAY.
IT'S CALLED DANCING MUSIC.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.530

JUST KEEP GOING, MURRAY.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.965

- SURE THING, MURRAY.
- MAKE SURE THEY HAVE
A COCKTAIL EACH, OKAY?

00:41.642 --> 00:44.312
HERE'S $20.
I DON'T TRUST IT WITH THEM.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.447
LAST TIME I GAVE THEM $20
THEY WENT AWAY AND SPENT IT.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.616
BOUGHT A MAGAZINE
AND A GIANT BEACH BALL.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.685
- YOU CAN COUNT ON ME, MURRAY.
- MAKE SURE THEY DON'T
RUN AWAY, OKAY?

00:51.785 --> 00:54.422
- RIGHT. OUT YOU GET, GUYS.
- WE MIGHT NOT GET IN, MURRAY.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.824

00:56.924 --> 01:00.128
- YES, WE'RE NOT THAT COOL.

PRETTY COOL.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.795
- HANG ON.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.697
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
HI.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.734
I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF
VERY COOL LOOKING GUYS
IN THE BACK OF MY CAR.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.670
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE
KEEN TO HAVE THEM IN YOUR CLUB.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.140
HE'S NOT COMING IN.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.476

NIGHTCLUBBING, OKAY?

01:18.446 --> 01:21.315

YOU GUYS ARE DORKING UP
MY VIBE WITH ALL THE DICKS.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.429
WE NEED TO
SPREAD THE DICKS
OUT A LITTLE BIT,

02:08.529 --> 02:10.898
CREATE SOME LADY SPACE.
COME ON, MOVE APART, GUYS.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.266
SPREAD 'EM OUT.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.768
THIS ISN'T
THE RIVERDANCE ANYMORE.

HELLO.
BRET SPEAKING.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.791
BRET, IT'S JEMAINE SPEAKING.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.193
HEY, MAN.
WHERE ARE YOU?
DID YOU RUN AWAY?

04:53.293 --> 04:54.928
NO, I WENT HOME
WITH A GIRL.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.730
WHAT?

04:56.830 --> 04:59.066
BRET, I THINK SHE MIGHT
BE AUSTRALIAN.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.701
ARE YOU SURE
SHE'S AUSTRALIAN?

05:00.801 --> 05:03.871
EITHER SHE'S AUSTRALIAN
OR SHE REALLY LIKES AUSTRALIA.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.607
Oh, you've got
to get out of there.
Just get out of there.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.176
I'M-- I'M-- I'M LOCKED IN.
SHE'S TRAPPED ME.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.978
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.481
OKAY, UM, KEEP CALM.

05:13.581 --> 05:14.982
JUMP OUT THE WINDOW.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.617
GOOD IDEA.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.821
OH, IT'S TOO HIGH.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.424
OKAY, WELL, DO ONE OF THOSE
DIVE ROLLS WHEN YOU LAND.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.125
OKAY, I'LL TRY.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.561
G'DAY.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.464
OH, HEY.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.366
JESUS, GOT A TONGUE LIKE
A BADGER'S ASSHOLE.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.134
WHAT YOU DOING THERE,
BIG J?

05:34.234 --> 05:35.936
UM, JUST TALKING
TO A FRIEND OF MINE.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.271
- HEY.
- DON'T TALK TO HER.
SHE'S DEFINITELY AUSTRALIAN.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.807
I'M NOT SURE
I GOT YOUR NAME.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.542
KEITHA.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.112
- PARDON?
- KEITHA.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.747
KEITHA?

05:46.847 --> 05:49.082
YEAH, IT'S LIKE KEITH
BUT WITH AN "A" AT THE END.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.984
I WAS NAMED
AFTER ME DAD.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.453
SHE'S GOT A MAN'S NAME.

05:52.553 --> 05:53.721
KEITHA,
THAT'S A LOVELY NAME.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.456
SO HOW ABOUT
WE GO BACK TO BED?

05:55.556 --> 05:58.325
- UM...
- Definitely don't do that.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.894
( exhales )
NO, I CAN'T.

06:00.994 --> 06:04.364
- OH.
- WOULD YOU BE ABLE
TO UNLOCK THE DOOR?

06:06.834 --> 06:08.502
THANKS FOR COMING.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.938
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- FINE.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.573
JUST ASHAMED.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.341
HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW
SHE WAS AUSTRALIAN?

06:14.442 --> 06:16.610
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS LOUD IN
THE NIGHTCLUB.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.112
- DOES SHE LOOK AUSTRALIANY?
- NOT PARTICULARLY, NO.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.983
I MEAN THE FACE, I SUPPOSE,
BUT NOT BODILY, NOT AT ALL.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.052
DOES SHE SOUND AUSTRALIAN?
AUSTRALIAN ACCENT?

06:25.152 --> 06:26.987
YES. YES.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.656
WHAT DID IT SOUND LIKE?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.858
KIND OF LIKE AN EVIL
VERSION OF OUR ACCENT.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.393
- DID SHE MOCK YOUR ACCENT?
- NOT THAT I REMEMBER.

06:33.494 --> 06:36.363
SHE MAY HAVE SUBTLY
MOCKED YOUR ACCENT
AND YOU DIDN'T NOTICE.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.899
SHE MAY HAVE SUBTLY
BEEN MOCKING ME.

06:38.999 --> 06:42.503
( whispers )
DID YOU USE PROTECTION?

06:44.337 --> 06:47.007
YES, BUT ONLY
ON MY PENIS.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.743
- WHAT'S THAT?
- WHAT? WHAT?

06:49.843 --> 06:53.113
- WHAT'S THAT RED
MARK ON YOUR LIP?
- WHAT? WHERE?

06:53.213 --> 06:55.115
THAT'S ALL RED.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.550
- THAT'S LIPSTICK.
- IT'S CRABS.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.652
- IT'S NOT CRABS.
- IT'S CRABS.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.021
IT'S LIPSTICK.
LOOK, THAT'S NOT--

07:01.121 --> 07:02.756
IT'S NOT CRABS.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.257
GOT YOUR WALLET?
SHE DIDN'T STEAL YOUR WALLET?

07:04.357 --> 07:05.759
NO, I'VE ACTUALLY
GOT MY WALLET.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.561
SHE PROBABLY TRIED
TO STEAL YOUR WALLET.

07:07.661 --> 07:10.498
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.736
WELL, GOOD NEWS.
YOUR BISCUITS ARRIVED.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.070
EH?

07:17.170 --> 07:19.507
THEY'VE BEEN APPROVED
FROM THE WELLINGTON OFFICE.

07:19.607 --> 07:22.810
- FROM THE GOVERNMENT?
- YUP. THERE WE GO.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.377
OH, GREAT.

07:24.478 --> 07:27.014
- GINGER NUTS.
- OH, NICE.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.682
I GOT A REJECTED FORM.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.984
OH, JEMAINE, REJECTED.
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.153
"DID NOT FILL OUT
THE FORM CORRECTLY.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.588
PURPOSE FOR
THE BISCUITS..."

07:34.688 --> 07:36.890
YOU PUT "NA."
WHAT IS "NA"?

07:36.990 --> 07:38.692
NOT APPLICABLE.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.994
- THERE'S NO PURPOSE
FOR YOUR BISCUITS?
- NO, I JUST WANTED THEM.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.797
WELL, THEY'RE HARDLY
GONNA SEND YOU BISCUITS
IF THERE'S NO PURPOSE.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.866
THINK ABOUT IT.
FILL OUT YOUR FORMS PROPERLY.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.168
WELL, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
EATEN THEM, I SUPPOSE.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.537
WHAT DID YOU
PUT ON YOUR FORM?

07:49.637 --> 07:51.204
I THINK I PUT
I WAS GONNA EAT THEM.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.374
THERE YOU GO.
OKAY, SIMPLE AS THAT.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.243
TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU COULD PROBABLY HAVE--

07:56.343 --> 07:58.979
BRET, COULD HE HAVE ONE OF
YOURS UNTIL I GET THIS SORTED?

07:59.079 --> 08:01.749
WOULD THAT BE ALL RIGHT?

08:03.483 --> 08:06.219
THAT'S THE BOY.
THAT'S GOOD. NICE.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.155
RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.058
NEXT, NIGHTCLUBBING
EXPERIENCES.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.160
ANYTHING TO REPORT BACK?

08:13.260 --> 08:15.162
- NOTHING?
- UH...

08:15.262 --> 08:17.531
DID YOU DANCE?

08:17.631 --> 08:20.367
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO
TO THE NIGHTCLUB, MURRAY.

08:20.467 --> 08:23.003
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

08:23.103 --> 08:24.705
- NOTHING.
- BRET?

08:24.805 --> 08:26.607
SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO JEMAINE?

08:26.707 --> 08:28.942
- JEMAINE SLEPT
WITH AN AUSTRALIAN.
- WHAT?!

08:29.042 --> 08:30.744
- BRET.
- JEMAINE SLEPT WITH
AN AUSTRALIAN.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.047
NO, I HEARD YOU.
I SAID "WHAT" AS IN
I HEARD YOU

08:34.147 --> 08:36.183
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I'M HEARING.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.685
IS THIS TRUE, JEMAINE?

08:37.785 --> 08:39.787
- SHH.
- I KNOW, SHH.

08:39.887 --> 08:42.556
- THIS IS TRUE.
- YEAH? REALLY?

08:42.656 --> 08:44.692
I ACCIDENTLY SLEPT
WITH AN AUSTRALIAN.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.794
HOW DO YOU ACCIDENTLY
SLEEP WITH ONE?

08:46.894 --> 08:48.896
WHAT, DID SHE GET YOU
NAKED AND YOU TRIPPED OVER
AND FELL ON HER?

08:48.996 --> 08:51.264
- IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?
- NO, IT WASN'T EXACTLY
LIKE THAT.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.067
- LOOK, CLOSE
THE DOOR, PLEASE, BRET.
- CLOSE THE DOOR, BRET.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.469
- I DIDN'T--
- I DON'T WANT TO
HEAR IT, OKAY?

08:56.570 --> 08:58.271
I'M TALKING TO BRET NOW.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.575
JEMAINE, DON'T LISTEN.
TURN AWAY.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.645
BRET, COME IN A BIT.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.314
DO YOU THINK HE'S LISTENING?
LET'S TEST IT.

09:07.414 --> 09:08.916
JEMAINE'S A GOOD-LOOKING
GUY, ISN'T HE?

09:09.016 --> 09:12.519
- THERE HE GOES.
- YEAH, HE'S LISTENING.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.688
RIGHT, NOW THIS IS SERIOUS.
MAYBE WE SHOULD

09:14.788 --> 09:16.624
BANISH HIM, YOU KNOW,
FROM THE GROUP.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.859
CAST HIM OFF, YOU KNOW?

09:18.959 --> 09:21.862
NEVER SPEAK OF HIM AGAIN,
JUST FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.597
- THAT SEEMS A BIT FULL-ON.
- DOES IT?

09:23.697 --> 09:25.899
IT DOES, DOESN'T IT?
LOCK HIM UP.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.702
JUST LOCK HIM UP.
DON'T LISTEN.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.304
- WHAT DID YOU HEAR?
- NOTHING.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.609
OKAY, LET'S GET BACK
INTO THE GROUP.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.746
OKAY, COME BACK, JEMAINE.
THANK YOU.

09:38.846 --> 09:42.149
WE CAN'T COME TO A DECISION
AS TO WHAT TO DO.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.484
UM...
( sighs )

09:44.584 --> 09:48.121
NOW THIS GIRL,
DID SHE MAKE FUN OF YOU?

09:48.221 --> 09:50.691
WE THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE
SLIGHTLY MOCKED HIS ACCENT.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.293
SHE MAY HAVE MOCKED
MY ACCENT SUBTLY.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.929
I BET SHE DID.
THEY'RE TRICKY.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.331
YOU KNOW, GUYS,
IN THE OLD DAYS

09:58.431 --> 10:00.000
THE SAILORS USED
TO FALL FOR THEM.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.235
YEAH, THEY HADN'T SEEN
A WOMAN FOR WEEKS

10:02.335 --> 10:05.205
AND THE AUSTRALIANS WOULD
LURE THEM TO THE BOTTOM OF
THE SEA AND THEY'D DROWN.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.340
- OH, THAT'S MERMAIDS.
- THAT'S MERMAIDS YOU'RE
THINKING OF.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.742
- IS IT?
- THAT'S NOT AUSTRALIANS.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.411
YEAH, BUT THE AUSTRALIAN
ONES WERE THE WORST.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.413
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY.

10:13.513 --> 10:14.748
IF YOU'RE INTO THOSE
SORTS OF THINGS,

10:14.848 --> 10:16.116
WATCH OUT FOR
THE AUSTRALIAN ONES.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.585
SHE DIDN'T SEEM
THAT BAD, YOU KNOW?

10:18.686 --> 10:20.654
- EH?
- JEMAINE.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.757
- DO YOU HAVE FEELINGS
FOR THIS GIRL?
- NO.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.826
ONLY NEGATIVE ONES.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.829
GOOD.
HAVE YOU GOT YOUR WALLET?

10:28.929 --> 10:31.665
- YES, I'VE GOT MY WALLET.
- GOOD.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.701
( knocks )

10:35.302 --> 10:37.504
- OH, HI, BIG J.

DO YOU HAVE MY WALLET?

10:37.604 --> 10:39.406

10:42.509 --> 10:45.746
- THANK YOU.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.316
OH, COME ON, YOU BIG MUNG.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.226
( water running )

11:05.498 --> 11:07.034

11:09.803 --> 11:11.905

11:16.343 --> 11:18.011
THANK YOU.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.715
MMM, DELICIOUS TEA.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.984
THANKS.
IT'S ME MOM'S RECIPE.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.153
OH, IS YOUR MOM
AUSTRALIAN?

11:26.253 --> 11:28.188
YEAH YEAH,
SHE'S A PANEL BEATER.

11:28.288 --> 11:31.058
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?
YOU SAID HE'S AN
AUSTRALIAN STILL?

11:31.158 --> 11:33.727
YEAH YEAH, ME DAD'S SO
AUSTRALIAN HE'S IN PRISON.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.529
MMM, WHAT ABOUT HIS FATHER?
WAS HE AUSTRALIAN?

11:36.629 --> 11:37.831
- MY GRANDPA?
- YEAH.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.666
YEAH.
YEAH.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.002
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM'S MOTHER?
WAS SHE AN IMMIGRANT?

11:42.102 --> 11:46.673
LISTEN, BIG J,
YOU COULDN'T GET MORE
AUSTRALIAN THAN ME.

11:46.774 --> 11:49.009
MY GREAT-GREAT-GRANDPA
WAS A RENOWN RAPIST.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.378
AND THEY SHIPPED HIM
OUT TO AUSTRALIA

11:51.478 --> 11:54.614
AND THAT'S WHERE HE MET
MY GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMA.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.717
SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE.
I MEAN, I SAID MET,
BUT HE RAPED HER.

11:57.818 --> 12:01.054
HMM. DO YOU THINK THERE'S
ANY CHANCE YOU WERE ADOPTED?

12:01.154 --> 12:04.591
LOOK, BIG J.
YOU GOT TWO OPTIONS.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.160
A: SIT AROUND HERE ASKING
ME STUPID QUESTIONS,

12:07.260 --> 12:09.963
OR B: GET IN THAT BEDROOM
AND ROOT ME AGAIN.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.133
THEY'RE BOTH GOOD OPTIONS.

12:15.002 --> 12:19.907
* DO AUSTRALIANS
FEEL LOVE? *

12:21.574 --> 12:23.710
* ARE THEY CAPABLE
OF LOVE? *

12:23.811 --> 12:27.447
* DO THEY EVEN KNOW
WHAT WE'RE SPEAKING OF? *

12:30.818 --> 12:33.553
BRET.
BRET.

12:33.653 --> 12:36.523
BRET!
BRET.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.691
WHAT?

12:38.792 --> 12:41.094
CAN I ASK YOU
A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION?

12:41.194 --> 12:42.796
CAN IT WAIT
TILL THE MORNING?

12:42.896 --> 12:45.098
I SUPPOSE SO.

12:48.836 --> 12:52.239
BRET.
BRET.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.942
BRET. BRET.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.978
- BRET.
- WHAT'S THE QUESTION
YOU WANT TO ASK ME?

12:58.078 --> 13:00.814
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
IF I DID DO OUT WITH THAT...

13:00.914 --> 13:03.516
- AUSTRALIAN?
- EH?

13:03.616 --> 13:06.887
I'M JUST SAYING THAT
IF YOU WERE TO GO OUT
WITH AN AUSTRALIAN...

13:06.987 --> 13:09.322
WELL, I WOULD NEVER GO OUT
WITH AN AUSTRALIAN.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.025
IF YOU WERE TO,
I WOULD BE FINE WITH IT.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.027
I MEAN, WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,
YOU TRIED TO HAVE ME DEPORTED

13:14.127 --> 13:15.562
FROM NEW ZEALAND 'CAUSE YOU
THOUGHT I WAS AN AUSTRALIAN.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.898
THAT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING.
YOU WERE WEARING A VEST TOP.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.401
MY MOM GAVE ME THAT.
SHE THOUGHT IT MADE ME
LOOK LIKE BRUCE WILLIS.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.937
WELL, IT DIDN'T.
IT MADE YOU LOOK LIKE
AN AUSTRALIAN.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.106
YOU CAN'T GO OUT
WITH THAT GIRL.

13:26.206 --> 13:30.077
HEY, SHE'D NEVER
BE MY GIRLFRIEND.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.047
MURRAY, BRET,

13:34.147 --> 13:36.683
THIS IS MY GIRLFRIEND
KEITHA.

13:36.783 --> 13:39.352
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, JEMAINE?
- WHAT IS THAT YOU'RE WEARING?

13:39.452 --> 13:41.154
- WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?
- WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

13:41.254 --> 13:44.291
HI, GUYS.
YOU CAN CALL ME KEITH,
BY THE WAY.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.026
- THAT'S A MAN'S NAME.
- IT'S A FEMALE NAME.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.360
IT'S GOT AN "A"
ON THE END.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.796
GOT QUITE THE ACCENT,
DON'T YOU, KEVINA?

13:49.897 --> 13:52.332
YEAH, I'VE GOT
A REAL AUSSIE ACCENT.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.735
EXCEPT IT'S NOT AS STRONG
AS IT USED TO BE SINCE
I'VE LIVED HERE,

13:55.835 --> 13:57.770
'CAUSE EVERY TIME I'M ON
THE PHONE WITH MY MOM

13:57.871 --> 13:59.639
SHE SAYS I SOUND
LIKE MARILYN MONROE.

13:59.739 --> 14:02.709
- DID YOU CATCH THAT?
- WHAT ARE YOU DEAF?
MARILYN MONROE.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.311
- OH, MARILYN MONROE.
- YEAH.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.713
- WHAT ABOUT HER?
- I TALK LIKE HER NOW.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.216
- SHE SOUNDS LIKE HER.
- Murray: SHE DOES SOUND
A BIT LIKE HER.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.683
YEAH, I SUPPOSE IF YOU
SQUINT YOUR EARS.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.652
TOLD YA.

14:12.752 --> 14:15.923
KEITHA, DO YOU MIND
NOT LISTENING FOR
A MOMENT, PLEASE?

14:16.023 --> 14:17.925
JEMAINE, COME IN A BIT.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.692
( whispering )
WHAT DID YOU BRING
HER HERE FOR?

14:19.792 --> 14:21.494
DON'T TALK ABOUT HER.
SHE'S RIGHT THERE.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.364
- SHE'S NOT LISTENING, IS SHE?
- SHE'S SO CLOSE...

14:24.464 --> 14:26.099
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GO TO THE DUNNY.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.835
- GOT TO MURDER
A BROWN SNAKE, YOU KNOW?
- OH MY GOD.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.238
MUZZA, BRET, SWEETCOCKS.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.640
JEMAINE, YOU CAN'T BE
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.276
- I AM SERIOUS.
- HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.678
- NO, IT'S NOT
GONNA WORK, MAN.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:38.778 --> 14:41.081
AND YOUR CHILDREN,
WHAT ABOUT THEM?
WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THEM?

14:41.181 --> 14:43.016
THEY'LL BE ABERRATIONS,
WON'T THEY?

14:43.116 --> 14:44.717
IT'S PRONOUNCED
ABORIGINES.

14:44.817 --> 14:48.455
WELL, THINK OF THEM.
THEY'LL BE NEITHER HERE
NOR THERE,

14:48.555 --> 14:52.192
FORCED TO MOVE
FROM CITY TO CITY LOOKING
FOR THE PERFECT WAVE.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.128
- WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA TELL YOUR MOM?
- I WON'T TELL MY MOM.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.999
- WHAT ABOUT CHRISTMAS, EH?
- SHE CAN'T COME TO CHRISTMAS.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.467
SHE'S GONNA RIDICULE
US AT CHRISTMAS.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.535
MAYBE I WILL GO TO
HER HOUSE FOR CHRISTMAS.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.571
- I DON'T HAVE TO DO
EVERYTHING YOU SAY.
- KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.706
- SORRY.
- AND SIT UP STRAIGHT.
YOU'RE SLOUCHING TERRIBLY.

15:06.806 --> 15:08.241
NO, DON'T STAND UP,
JUST SIT UP.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.277
LET'S GO BEFORE
WE GET RIDICULED.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.613
SHE'S PROBABLY IN THE TOILET
THINKING OF SOMETHING TO
BRING ME DOWN WITH.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.915
COME ON.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.952
SEE YOU LATER,
BIG J.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.121
LET'S GO, LITTLE B.

15:21.221 --> 15:24.424
- OKAY, LITTLE M.
- MEDIUM M.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.427
( sighs )

15:30.563 --> 15:34.234
JEMAINE, DID YOU LISTEN TO
THE ANSWER PHONE MESSAGE?

15:34.334 --> 15:36.136
I THINK THERE MAY BE
AN ANSWER PHONE MESSAGE

15:36.236 --> 15:38.071
FOR YOU
ON THE ANSWER PHONE.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.707
YES, BRET, I LISTENED TO
THE ANSWER PHONE MESSAGE.

15:40.807 --> 15:43.143
OH, GOOD NEWS?
BAD NEWS?

15:43.243 --> 15:45.478
UH, IT'S YOU PUTTING ON
A WOMAN'S VOICE

15:45.578 --> 15:48.315
PRETENDING TO BE KEITHA
BREAKING UP WITH ME.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.583
- DON'T THINK SO.
- IT'S CLEARLY YOU, BRET.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.952
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- IT'S OBVIOUSLY YOU
PUTTING ON A WOMAN'S VOICE.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.754
- LISTEN.
- ( beeps )

15:54.854 --> 15:56.856
- ( high voice )
G'day, Big J.
- THAT'S THE ONE.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.292
It's Keitha here.
I've got some bad news.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.995
- IT'S KEITHA.
- I'm moving back
to Wollongong.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.696
- SHE'S NOT FROM WOLLONGONG.
- SHH.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.632
- SHE'S FROM WOLLAMALOO.
- It was nice going
out with you.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.068
- SHH.
- But I'm never gonna
see you again. Bye.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.870
- OH NO.
- And I'm married.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.441
- ( deep voice )
Who's on the phone, love?
- THAT'S HER HUSBAND.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.210
( high voice )
Uh, nobody. I've got to go.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.512
- OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE.
- ( sighs )

16:19.612 --> 16:22.482
- ( machine beeps )
- JEMAINE, THAT'S TERRIBLE.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.584
THAT'S JUST--

16:24.684 --> 16:26.219
I'M GOING, BRET.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.788
JEMAINE, DID I SHOW YOU
MY GLOVES THAT LOOK
LIKE MY HANDS?

16:28.888 --> 16:30.490
GET OFF.
GET OFF.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.493
LET GO OF MY GLOVE.
OW, THAT'S ACTUALLY MY HAND.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.396
- THAT'S ACTUALLY MY HAND.
- I'M GOING.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.436
( knocking )

16:43.536 --> 16:45.138
YEAH?

16:45.238 --> 16:47.074
- I NEED TO SEE KEITHA.
- WHO?

16:47.174 --> 16:49.276
KEITHA.
KEITHA.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.045
KEITHA.
KEITH WITH AN "A"
AT THE END.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.047
NO, YOU CAN'T SEE HER.

16:54.147 --> 16:57.217
W-WELL, I NEED TO SEE HER.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.086
WELL, YOU CAN'T
'CAUSE SHE'S MOVED
BACK TO AUSTRALIA.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.288
- WHAT'S GOING ON, KELS?
- WHAT?

17:01.388 --> 17:03.190
DR. SPECTACLES HERE
IS LOOKING FOR KEITHA.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.292
OH, SHE'S GONE, MATE.
SHE SAID YOU WERE A PRICK

17:05.392 --> 17:07.294
AND THEN SHE GOT ON THE BUS
BACK TO AUSTRALIA FOR GOOD.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.396
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
THAT'S HER SWEATSHIRT.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.299
SHE DOESN'T NEED
A SWEATSHIRT IN AUSTRALIA.
IT'S HOT.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.067
WELL, I CAN SEE HER,
ACTUALLY.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.968
- NO, MATE.
SHE'S GONE BACK TO OZ.
- NO, MATE.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.337
SHE'S THERE.
SHE'S RIGHT THERE.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.472
YOU DON'T NEED TO REALLY
KEEP GOING, DO YOU?

17:19.572 --> 17:21.974
NO, MATE, SHE'S GONE.
SHE'S IN AUSTRALIA
LIKE WE SAID.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.977

OUR LOVE CAN NEVER BE.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.854
CAN NEVER BE WHAT?

17:34.954 --> 17:36.389
WELL, YOU KNOW,
CAN NEVER BE.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.758
OH, WELL, MY MATES
THINK THAT TOO.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.594
BECAUSE I'M A NEW ZEALANDER
AND YOU'RE AN AUSTRALIAN

17:41.694 --> 17:44.231
AND THEY DON'T THINK
WE CAN BE TOGETHER?

17:44.331 --> 17:46.133
NO, MOSTLY IT'S 'CAUSE
THEY THINK YOU'RE A DICK.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.767
YOU KNOW, WITH THE DICKISH
GLASSES AND THAT.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.103
NO, IT'S MAINLY
BECAUSE THEY THINK

17:50.203 --> 17:51.871
OUR RACES SHOULDN'T MIX.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.807
NO, MOSTLY IT'S 'CAUSE
THEY THINK I'VE ROOTED
BETTER-LOOKING FELLAS

17:54.907 --> 17:56.976
WHEN I'VE BEEN
TOO DRUNK TO SPEAK.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.945
IS THAT HOW YOU FEEL?

17:59.045 --> 18:01.981
50-50.
I KINDA LIKE YOU.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.851
I KINDA LIKE YOU TOO.

EVEN THOUGH
YOU'RE FROM AUSTRIA

22:01.821 --> 22:04.123
AND YOU'RE FROM
SOMEPLACE NO ONE'S EVEN
FUCKING HEARD OF.

22:04.223 --> 22:05.825
- AUSTRALIA.
- NEW ZEALAND.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.227
EXACTLY, BECAUSE IT
SHOULDN'T MATTER

22:08.327 --> 22:09.796
WHERE YOU'RE FROM
WHEN LOVE'S INVOLVED.

22:09.896 --> 22:13.332
IT'S LIKE THAT MOVIE,
"INTERRACIAL HOLE STRETCHERS 2."

22:13.433 --> 22:15.835
SHE WAS WHITE
AND THEY WERE BLACK,

22:15.935 --> 22:18.170
BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER
IN THE END, DID IT?

22:18.270 --> 22:19.539
BECAUSE THEY WERE IN LOVE.

22:19.639 --> 22:22.442
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT ONE.

22:22.542 --> 22:23.776
WELL, IT REALLY AFFECTED ME.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.639
DON'T DRINK THE WATER.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.267
EXCUSE ME.
HAVE YOU SEEN AN AUSTRALIAN
GIRL AROUND HERE?

23:21.367 --> 23:22.635

23:22.735 --> 23:26.439
SORRY, PAL.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.140
HOW MUCH IS IT TO
NEW JERSEY, BY THE WAY?

23:28.240 --> 23:31.143
I DON'T GO TO NEW JERSEY.
I ONLY RIDE AROUND THE PARK.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.179

24:23.563 --> 24:25.097
SHE ROBBED US.

24:25.197 --> 24:27.333
HER AND HER FRIENDS JUMPED ME
AND TAPED ME TO THE DOOR.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.869
DID SHE MENTION ME AT ALL?

24:29.969 --> 24:31.704
NO, SORRY, MAN.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.641
( sighs )
I'M NOT SURE
ABOUT HER AND ME.

24:34.741 --> 24:36.375
COULD YOU PASS ME
MY SANDWICH, PLEASE?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.444
OKAY.

24:38.545 --> 24:40.046
HERE'S YOUR SANDWICH.

24:40.146 --> 24:43.182
