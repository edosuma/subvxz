WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.177
- Previously on Nashville...

00:03.220 --> 00:04.526
- I auditioned for
"Nashville'’s Next".

00:04.569 --> 00:05.657
He cannot be trusted.

00:05.701 --> 00:06.876
- You know who that is,
don'’t you?

00:06.919 --> 00:08.008
Rayna James'’ daughter.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.661
- You had people
shooting at you?

00:09.705 --> 00:11.098
Your friends just blowing up
in front of your face?

00:11.141 --> 00:12.969
I want to turn it off
for just one day,

00:13.013 --> 00:14.014
is that too
much to ask?

00:14.057 --> 00:16.799
- Let go of him, Brad!

00:16.842 --> 00:18.061
- We'’ll be talking.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.541
- He'’s suing me
for full custody.

00:19.584 --> 00:22.022
- The only way that you
truly get over someone

00:22.065 --> 00:23.588
is with someone else.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.938
- I crashed there on the floor.

00:25.982 --> 00:26.939
- Dude, look, you gotta
just chill.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.550
- Just, no.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.508
- Nothing happened.

00:37.298 --> 00:38.690
Omelet?
- Yep.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.344
- I was gonna make
you breakfast today.

00:40.388 --> 00:41.954
- Well, I beat you to it.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.086
- Looks like you did.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.566
First day. How do you feel?

00:44.609 --> 00:46.220
- I'’m okay.

00:46.263 --> 00:47.699
- What time you
wanna head out?

00:47.743 --> 00:50.093
- 8:30.
And you owe me.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.705
- Uh...

00:53.749 --> 00:55.142
- Go back to bed.
I'’m gonna take her.

00:55.185 --> 00:58.362
- Nope. I'’m wide awake.
I'’ll take her.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.496
- Nothing.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.019
Maddie said
she'’s good to take me.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.020
- I told you I wanna be
a part of this, right?

01:04.064 --> 01:05.543
- Yeah, and you have been.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.023
There'’s just really
nothing else to see.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.417
- This is about me
and Brad, isn'’t it?

01:12.507 --> 01:14.248
I'’m sorry, all right?

01:14.291 --> 01:16.250
I didn'’t want this to turn
into more stress for you.

01:16.293 --> 01:18.861
- I know. It'’s okay.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.689
- All right, your sister
can take you today.

01:20.732 --> 01:21.777
But we'’re gonna figure
something out, all right?

01:21.820 --> 01:23.561
- Perfect. Thank you.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.128
- I want a full report too.
- Of course.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.869
- Everything.
- Of course.

01:35.312 --> 01:38.010
- ♪ I think sometimes about

01:38.054 --> 01:41.405
♪ How things could
have been different ♪

01:41.449 --> 01:44.713
♪ One less late night

01:44.756 --> 01:46.062
You spying on me?
- Oh!

01:46.106 --> 01:48.151
Apparently.
How'’d you do that?

01:48.195 --> 01:50.110
- Shadow.
- Oh.

01:53.069 --> 01:55.071
- Don'’t say nothin'
till I'’m finished.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.292
I think I found you
an open mic.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.337
- And you'’re completely
forgetting about last time.

02:00.381 --> 02:01.991
It'’s a coffee shop.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.775
It'’s cozy, it's quiet.

02:03.819 --> 02:08.258
Might be good to get in front
of a small audience in a venue.

02:08.302 --> 02:09.738
I'’ll be there the whole time.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.348
And that'’s actually
pretty much it.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.524
- Why you care
about this so much?

02:13.568 --> 02:15.961
- Because you have a gift.

02:16.005 --> 02:18.529
And I know the more I say it,
the less you believe me.

02:18.573 --> 02:20.183
So if you look me in the eye
right now and tell me that

02:20.227 --> 02:22.533
you'’re happier here
singing to yourself,

02:22.577 --> 02:24.318
then I'’m not gonna
bother you about it again.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.320
But if there'’s any part
of you that wants this

02:26.363 --> 02:30.541
even a little bit,
why not try it just once?

02:30.585 --> 02:33.544
- And I do this,
you quit pestering me?

02:33.588 --> 02:35.024
- No.

02:39.855 --> 02:42.553
- Look, I'’m sorry for coming
at you the other night.

02:42.597 --> 02:44.294
- I'’m just sorry
about your nose.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.862
- Yeah.
Damn guitar snuck up on me.

02:46.905 --> 02:48.211
- Yeah.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.691
I mean, you know
I would never do that

02:49.734 --> 02:51.910
to you over with
someone you'’re seeing.

02:51.954 --> 02:53.651
- Yeah, I know.

02:53.695 --> 02:55.610
And just for the record,

02:55.653 --> 02:58.003
we'’re still totally casual,
by the way.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.225
- Yeah, we are.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.009
I guess I thought
it was more than that.

03:04.053 --> 03:08.884
But now I understand it,
and that'’s that.

03:08.927 --> 03:11.147
- I'’m not really looking
to be with anyone right now.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.803
I mean, every time
the doorbell rings, I...

03:17.545 --> 03:19.068
You think it'’s Juliette?

03:19.111 --> 03:20.461
- Yeah.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.637
- I'’m sorry, buddy.
I mean...

03:22.680 --> 03:24.334
I didn'’t think, well...

03:24.378 --> 03:26.597
- I just haven'’t really been
talking about it lately.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.120
- Look, if you do
wanna talk about it

03:28.164 --> 03:31.167
or you just need a hand
with Cadence

03:31.211 --> 03:33.952
or need another person
at that fortress

03:33.996 --> 03:36.999
you live at,
give me a call, all right?

03:38.914 --> 03:40.437
- Thanks.

03:40.481 --> 03:43.135
- Well, well, well,
look at all you chickadees

03:43.179 --> 03:47.009
sitting here staring out
into the great unknown.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.056
You'’re gonna learn a lot over
the next couple of weeks.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.276
But there'’s one thing I can
tell you all right now...

03:53.320 --> 03:54.886
- No.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.801
- Okay.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.499
- I'’m gonna launch one of you
so high into the stratosphere,

03:58.542 --> 03:59.848
you'’re gonna forget you
were ever sitting here

03:59.891 --> 04:01.502
worrying about what
fools like us

04:01.545 --> 04:02.851
ever thought of you,
all right?

04:02.894 --> 04:04.722
So savor it!

04:04.766 --> 04:07.072
And to help coach you, we have
two of Nashville'’s finest.

04:07.116 --> 04:11.294
Multi-platinum recording
artist, multi-3FM award winner,

04:11.338 --> 04:13.470
Ms. Ilse De Witt.

04:16.430 --> 04:22.000
And 87-year Music Row veteran,
singer, producer,

04:22.044 --> 04:23.959
fashion designer,
responsible for...

04:24.002 --> 04:25.787
what is it...one,
two number one hits?

04:25.830 --> 04:27.223
- Try it again, buddy.
- All right.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.313
15 number one hits,
Mr. Tommy Reddick,

04:30.357 --> 04:31.575
ladies and gentlemen!

04:35.362 --> 04:36.711
- Ilse.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.495
- Me too!
Preston.

04:38.539 --> 04:41.193
- Daphne.
- So let'’s get started.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.108
- The strategy is simple.

04:43.152 --> 04:45.154
Make the cost so high
he doesn'’t have a choice

04:45.197 --> 04:46.764
but to come to the table
and settle.

04:48.723 --> 04:50.290
- It means we go to war,

04:50.333 --> 04:51.987
paralyzing his
company with discovery.

04:52.030 --> 04:54.032
Countersuing saying
he'’s a bad father

04:54.076 --> 04:55.904
and that you want
all parental rights.

04:55.947 --> 04:58.733
You find every person he'’s
ever screwed over in business

04:58.776 --> 05:00.604
and you bring him in
as a character witness.

05:00.648 --> 05:03.172
Most important, you put
your boy on the stand.

05:03.215 --> 05:04.521
- I can'’t do that.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.001
- You'’ll have to.

05:06.044 --> 05:08.482
Judges have emotions
like everybody else.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.353
And it'’s hard for them
to side with a man

05:10.397 --> 05:11.920
who'’s cruel to his child.

05:11.963 --> 05:13.791
- You don'’t know Brad.
He lives to fight.

05:13.835 --> 05:15.184
This is his element.

05:15.227 --> 05:17.534
- It'’s my element,
I assure you.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.929
- You don'’t gotta
worry about that.

05:20.972 --> 05:23.018
- I'’m not gonna
let you pay for this.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.933
- I'’m part of the reason
you'’re here right now, so...

05:24.976 --> 05:26.369
- But even if we go through
this whole thing,

05:26.413 --> 05:27.544
there'’s still a chance
that we could

05:27.588 --> 05:29.154
still lose, couldn'’t we?

05:29.198 --> 05:30.373
I mean, of course, we could.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.853
- The man'’s a bully.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.811
You want to stand up
to him or not?

05:49.871 --> 05:51.307
Excited?
- Yeah!

05:51.351 --> 05:53.396
Yeah?

05:53.440 --> 05:54.919
Well, I can imagine.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.704
I mean, I'’m still
so nervous when I have

05:56.747 --> 05:58.836
to sing a song for
the very first time.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.099
It'’s a moment where
you'’re completely vulnerable.

06:01.143 --> 06:04.015
But I think we share
something as songwriters.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.713
You know, we move through
the world

06:05.756 --> 06:08.368
just a little differently than
most people, you know.

06:08.411 --> 06:12.807
I'’d say we feel things probably
way deeper than most people.

06:12.850 --> 06:17.028
And we have this strange but
beautiful way of expressing

06:17.072 --> 06:19.901
ourselves and our truth.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.903
And when we'’re in this room,
I want you to know

06:21.946 --> 06:24.384
that there'’s absolutely
no judgment.

06:24.427 --> 06:27.604
We'’re just here to share what
we'’re working on as artists.

06:27.648 --> 06:30.912
So breathe, relax.

06:32.479 --> 06:37.571
So who wants to volunteer
and break the ice?

06:37.614 --> 06:40.617
Anybody?

06:40.661 --> 06:42.227
No

06:42.271 --> 06:44.795
It'’s okay, it's okay.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.801
- ♪ I don'’t wanna
think about it ♪

06:50.845 --> 06:55.240
♪ I don'’t really
wanna know ♪

06:55.284 --> 06:58.069

07:08.428 --> 07:10.038

gonna have to actually

07:10.081 --> 07:12.910
look at each other when you
do it for real, right?

07:12.954 --> 07:15.391
I mean, it'’s tough
to sell a sexy song

07:15.435 --> 07:18.612
just staring off into space.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.440
Come on!

07:20.483 --> 07:22.920
Does this whole band need to
go to couples therapy or what?

07:22.964 --> 07:26.489
- Is it still called couples
therapy if there'’s four of us?

07:26.533 --> 07:28.448
- I don'’t know.
That'’s a good question.

07:28.491 --> 07:29.797
What would you call it?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.587
- Hey.

07:37.631 --> 07:38.849
- Hi.

07:38.893 --> 07:41.896
- Yeah. I'’m sorry.

07:41.939 --> 07:44.942
I was just trying to be
sensitive to everyone right now.

07:44.986 --> 07:47.989
- I get it.
Don'’t worry.

07:48.032 --> 07:50.818
So what are you up
to the rest of the day?

07:50.861 --> 07:52.428
- Just heading back.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.779
I told Emily I'’d be
home by five, so...

07:58.390 --> 07:59.740
And you?

07:59.783 --> 08:01.568
- All sorts of
nonexistent plans.

08:03.526 --> 08:07.617
So I guess we'’ll each be at our
separate homes doing nothing.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.793
- Apparently.

08:11.578 --> 08:15.320
- All right, then.
I'’ll see you tomorrow, Avery.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.584
- See you tomorrow, Alannah.

08:28.986 --> 08:33.469
- ♪ Never know unless I try

08:33.513 --> 08:35.776
♪ So this is goodbye, dear

08:35.819 --> 08:37.995
- I think she'’s
absolutely precious.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.737
- Yes, but no one'’s gonna
believe a girl that young

08:40.781 --> 08:42.783
can be the next big thing
in country music.

08:42.826 --> 08:45.263
- Oh, they will when they
find out who her mama is.

08:45.307 --> 08:48.353
- Oh, I didn'’t know that was
part of your scoring category.

08:48.397 --> 08:51.966
- We are now in the business
of attracting eyeballs.

08:52.009 --> 08:54.708
And every Rayna James fan
is gonna be tuning in

08:54.751 --> 08:56.492
to see how
her daughter'’s doing.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.581
So as I believe they say
in Hollywood, the kid stays

08:58.625 --> 09:01.541
in the picture at least,
you know, for now.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.371
- Oh, it'’s horrifying.

09:08.635 --> 09:11.899
- All of it, but mainly the
idea of going to war with Brad

09:11.942 --> 09:14.292
because I cannot
imagine winning.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.556
- Well, you won'’t be
by yourself.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.906
- Well, there'’s no way that
you'’re gonna pay for this.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.298
- Jessie, it'’s gonna cost

09:20.342 --> 09:21.299
thousands and thousands
of dollars, right?

09:21.343 --> 09:22.866
You got that kind of money?

09:22.910 --> 09:24.433
- And you have that kind
of money to just throw away

09:24.476 --> 09:25.913
on somebody that'’s not
even your own kid?

09:25.956 --> 09:27.523
- Throw-- How is that
throwing away, Jessie?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.699
- Look, Deacon,
you'’re being a good guy.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.788
But this is absolutely crazy.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.660
And you know it'’s crazy.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.448
- Just trying to help.

09:39.491 --> 09:40.797
- Well, that'’s the problem.
That'’s the whole problem.

09:40.841 --> 09:42.538
- How is that
the problem, Jessie?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.192
- Because you can'’t rescue me!

09:44.235 --> 09:45.759
I'’ve spent my entire
life being rescued

09:45.802 --> 09:47.804
and here we go again.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.066
- When did it become this
big crime

09:49.110 --> 09:50.677
to want to
rescue somebody, huh?

09:50.720 --> 09:52.200
- It'’s not a crime!
I'’m talking about me!

09:52.243 --> 09:53.810
It'’s my own weakness.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.725
I need to be able
to solve my own problems.

09:55.769 --> 09:59.337
And I feel like...

09:59.381 --> 10:02.950
there'’s something
wrong with me.

10:02.993 --> 10:05.953
Like other people can make
things happen in their life

10:05.996 --> 10:07.955
and I just can'’t.

10:07.998 --> 10:10.653
And my son is now
suffering because of that

10:10.697 --> 10:12.960
and it just kills me.
And I'’m sorry.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.439
I don'’t mean to
take it out on you.

10:14.483 --> 10:17.747
You'’re the kindest person
I know, really.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.708
- So solve the problem.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.625
- I'’m working on it.

10:30.673 --> 10:31.935
- There she is!

10:31.979 --> 10:34.416
There'’s the girl
I been looking for.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.461
You know, the minute
I saw your audition tape,

10:36.505 --> 10:38.159
I thought about you
in that talent show.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.770
And I said to Ilse...
didn'’t I say this?

10:40.814 --> 10:43.294
I said, "The world has no
idea that this girl

10:43.338 --> 10:48.125
is the most talented member
of that entire family."

10:48.169 --> 10:51.520
But you need the right song.

10:52.913 --> 10:55.524
- A song about your mom.

10:55.567 --> 10:58.092
Look, I know you don'’t want
everybody thinking that

10:58.135 --> 10:59.702
you'’re just here
'’cause of your mom.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.095
And that'’s admirable,
all right?

11:01.138 --> 11:02.923
But they'’re gonna be
thinking it

11:02.966 --> 11:04.968
whether you want them
to or not, right?

11:05.012 --> 11:08.450
In my line, they call that
seizing the narrative.

11:08.493 --> 11:10.321
You get up there and
you make them think

11:10.365 --> 11:12.106
what you want '’em to think

11:12.149 --> 11:14.717
by telling '’em
what'’s in your heart.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.111
- I'’m sorry. I really think
that'’s just too private.

11:17.154 --> 11:18.721
- Well, we don'’t want you
to do anything

11:18.765 --> 11:20.027
you'’re not comfortable with.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.724
No, no, nonsense.

11:21.768 --> 11:25.119
That is exactly what we want.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.990
Let me ask you something.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.426
Are you an artist?

11:28.470 --> 11:30.037
Seriously, I'’m asking
you right now.

11:30.080 --> 11:33.649
Do you see yourself
as an artist?

11:33.693 --> 11:35.956
- I'’d like to be someday.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.785
- Look, modesty is not gonna
get you anywhere, Daph.

11:38.828 --> 11:44.225
You are an artist right now.

11:44.268 --> 11:48.229
And an artist will always
choose discomfort over safety.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.927
Taking all those
feelings churning inside

11:50.971 --> 11:53.277
and turning it into something,
that'’s songwriting.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.236
I mean, right?

11:55.279 --> 11:57.542
Clapton, "Tears From Heaven".
Faith Hill, "There You'’ll Be".

11:57.586 --> 12:00.415
The list goes on and
on and on. Right?

12:00.458 --> 12:03.026
Tell you what.

12:03.070 --> 12:06.987
Why don'’t you give it a shot?

12:07.030 --> 12:10.381
See if anything bubbles up.
What do you think?

12:10.425 --> 12:12.427
- Okay. I'’ll think about it.

12:12.470 --> 12:15.952
- There you go. Good job.

I'’m kind of headed

Any other time, all right?

- Don'’t worry about it.
See ya.

15:45.814 --> 15:48.382
- Hey.

15:48.425 --> 15:50.427
Sorry for just turning up
like this.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.777
But, well, I wanted
to talk to you.

15:52.821 --> 15:55.215
So is that crazy?

15:55.258 --> 15:56.694
- I'’ve seen crazier.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.046
- Yeah, sure.

16:04.311 --> 16:07.053
- Look, I'’m really sorry
about the other night.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.011
I shouldn'’t have reacted
the way I did.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.492
- That'’s okay.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.973
- Look, I know I haven'’t
really seen you since then.

16:14.016 --> 16:17.715
But I been thinking
about you...a lot.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.896
Well, I been thinking
about you too, Gunnar.

16:26.724 --> 16:29.771
- I mean, I have.

16:29.814 --> 16:33.383
I Just, I feel like
there'’s pressure.

16:33.427 --> 16:34.950
- I don'’t want you
to feel like that.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.561
I guess I didn'’t realize
how much I like you.

16:37.605 --> 16:42.610
- I just feel, you know,
you have this idea of me

16:42.653 --> 16:44.829
and that'’s what
you'’re interested in,

16:44.873 --> 16:46.701
not the actual me.

16:46.744 --> 16:49.008
Because you couldn'’t know
the actual me yet.

16:49.051 --> 16:53.012
- Well, I'’d like to get
to know the actual you.

16:59.844 --> 17:02.804
Oh, boy.
- It'’s okay.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.327
- Look, if you'’re
not into this,

17:04.371 --> 17:07.113
just say you'’re not into it.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.810
- I don'’t know
what to say, Gunnar.

17:08.853 --> 17:11.595
I'’m not into what
you'’re making it into.

17:11.639 --> 17:13.336
I mean, I like you.

17:13.380 --> 17:17.601
I just thought this was
gonna be something different.

17:17.645 --> 17:20.213
- So you'’re not ready
to be with anybody?

17:20.256 --> 17:21.779
Or is it just me?

17:24.173 --> 17:28.351
- I'’m just... I'm just pretty
shut down right now.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.007
- I get it, yeah.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.141
- I'’m sorry.

17:35.184 --> 17:40.363
- No, no. It'’s okay.
You know, it'’s better to know.

17:40.407 --> 17:41.843
Yeah, I'’ll see ya.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.284
- I'’m so proud of you.

17:49.851 --> 17:50.852
- Dude, did you hear '’em
stomping their feet?

17:50.895 --> 17:52.375
It was amazing!

17:52.419 --> 17:54.334
- No. I couldn'’t hear
anything at that point.

17:54.377 --> 17:55.857
- You could have a career
if you wanted.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.641
- Come on...
- No. You could.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.991
You gotta work at it.
But you really could.

18:00.035 --> 18:04.648
- I didn'’t expect it to feel
so good up there.

18:04.692 --> 18:05.997
- I think that
might have been

18:06.041 --> 18:07.521
the start of something
beautiful.

18:07.564 --> 18:10.219
And I'’m right here
if you need me.

18:14.571 --> 18:19.098
Um, I didn'’t...
That'’s not what I meant.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.708
- I'’m sorry.
- No, it'’s okay.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.492
- No. That was stupid.
- No, it wasn'’t.

18:22.536 --> 18:23.928
There'’s a lot of emotions
flying around.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.582
Please don'’t even
worry about it.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.584
- I'’m sorry.

If your mom were
here right now,

23:00.074 --> 23:01.423
what would you say to her?

23:06.428 --> 23:09.562
- I don'’t know.
That I miss her.

23:09.605 --> 23:12.565

23:12.608 --> 23:14.480

23:18.875 --> 23:21.443
Tell us why you miss her.
Tell us when you miss her.

23:21.487 --> 23:24.098
Tell us what it feels
like to miss her.

23:24.141 --> 23:25.795
Look, you...

23:25.839 --> 23:28.058
You gotta be specific
about what you'’re feeling

23:28.102 --> 23:31.235
or else the audience
isn'’t gonna feel anything.

23:31.279 --> 23:34.674
And that'’s not
what you want, right?

23:36.806 --> 23:38.634
Hey, Daph?

23:38.678 --> 23:40.941
I like where you'’re starting.
It'’s a good beginning.

23:40.984 --> 23:42.551
Great job, great job.

23:47.730 --> 23:48.992
- Hey.

23:49.036 --> 23:50.603
- You left your
jacket at sound check.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.169
- Oh, thanks.

23:52.213 --> 23:54.345
You didn'’t have to come
all the way over here.

23:54.389 --> 23:55.651
- I know.

23:59.873 --> 24:02.353
- You wanna... you can
come in if you...

24:02.397 --> 24:04.355
- I don'’t wanna
break any rules.

24:04.399 --> 24:05.835
- Stop it.

24:05.879 --> 24:07.010
We have to leave
for the show soon anyway.

24:07.054 --> 24:09.230
Come on.

24:09.273 --> 24:10.666
You want something to drink?

24:10.710 --> 24:12.320
- Oh, yes.

24:12.363 --> 24:16.019
- It'’s kind of strange.
I'’m rarely alone here.

24:16.063 --> 24:18.674
Cadence is staying
over at Emily'’s tonight

24:18.718 --> 24:21.242
because of the show.
- Right.

24:21.285 --> 24:23.026
- I'’m sorry about
the other day.

24:23.070 --> 24:24.724
- Oh...
- It'’s kind of awkward.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.508
So many moving parts.

24:26.552 --> 24:29.772
- I understand.
A thousand percent.

24:29.816 --> 24:31.644
You know, we all want
everything to happen

24:31.687 --> 24:36.170
in the perfect time without
baggage or complications.

24:36.213 --> 24:39.478
As if that ever happens
in the real world.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.088
- Sometimes it happens.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.788
- It does happen.

24:45.832 --> 24:49.966
Sometimes there'’s a train
leaving a station

24:50.010 --> 24:51.751
and you know if you
don'’t get on it,

24:51.794 --> 24:54.928
your life will be
different forever.

24:54.971 --> 24:57.670
And even though it'’s crazy,

24:57.713 --> 25:00.803
even though you know you
should be somewhere else,

25:00.847 --> 25:04.024
even though it goes
against everything

25:04.067 --> 25:08.507
you'’ve ever believed,
you get on that train.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.990
Or do you not believe that?

25:47.502 --> 25:49.548
- Did he tell you
to write that song?

25:52.463 --> 25:53.377
Daphne?

25:55.597 --> 25:57.120
- He suggested it.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.039
- Did you tell him you didn'’t
feel comfortable about it?

26:03.083 --> 26:04.563
- He'’s helping me with it.

26:04.606 --> 26:05.738
- Yeah, I know he'’s
helping you, all right?

26:05.781 --> 26:07.304
That'’s not the point.

26:07.348 --> 26:08.610
The point is he'’s exploiting
your feelings

26:08.654 --> 26:10.569
about losing your mom
for a TV show.

26:12.092 --> 26:13.441
- Do you think
I'’m an artist or not?

26:13.484 --> 26:15.138
- Come on now.
You know I do.

26:15.182 --> 26:17.053
- Then please stop telling me
that I'’m too young

26:17.097 --> 26:18.533
to write about
what I'’m feeling.

26:21.623 --> 26:24.278
- Listen, sweetheart.

26:24.321 --> 26:27.107
You wanna write about
your mom, that is fine, okay?

26:27.150 --> 26:28.804
Getting your feelings
out through your music,

26:28.848 --> 26:30.501
that'’s great,
it'’s therapeutic.

26:30.545 --> 26:32.199
But if you'’re trying
to force something

26:32.242 --> 26:33.722
before you'’re ready
'’cause he's pushing you,

26:33.766 --> 26:35.594
that is not fine.
That is just picking a scab.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.073
You'’re not gonna come up
with a good song either.

26:39.510 --> 26:42.165
All right. Good luck on
your make-up test.

26:42.209 --> 26:43.384
- Thank you.

26:43.427 --> 26:44.428
- Here'’s your note.

26:45.778 --> 26:48.084
Love you.
- Love you, too.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.361
- Okay, we should probably go.

27:04.405 --> 27:05.928
- Yeah, yeah, right.

27:11.412 --> 27:12.674
- Hey.

27:34.391 --> 27:37.830
- ♪ I don'’t wanna
think about it ♪

27:37.873 --> 27:42.008
♪ I don'’t really

27:42.051 --> 27:45.228

27:50.277 --> 27:54.716

28:01.767 --> 28:07.686
♪ Let'’s just go ♪

28:14.693 --> 28:17.739
- His stuff'’s gone.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.132
- We screwed up.

28:21.525 --> 28:23.049
Because we didn'’t think
about the consequences.

28:23.092 --> 28:25.225
- I thought about
the consequences.

28:25.268 --> 28:26.879
You'’re okay with this?

28:26.922 --> 28:30.143
- No. I'’m just tired of thinking
about the consequences.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.406
- I have no idea
what that means.

28:32.449 --> 28:34.887
- Because you'’re a guy.
You don'’t have to understand.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.715
- Oh, that'’s fair.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.586
- Every guy who likes a girl
thinks she owes him something.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.370
Ask any woman.

28:40.414 --> 28:43.896
And if you don'’t like them
back, they get mad at you.

28:43.939 --> 28:46.768
They text you,
sometimes they yell at you.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.639
Sometimes they stalk you.

28:48.683 --> 28:49.858
Sometimes it gets even worse.

28:49.902 --> 28:51.686
- Well, Gunnar is
not like that.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.862
- Oh, he just walked out in
the middle of the performance!

28:55.734 --> 28:59.389
So I thought about the
consequences, Avery, yes.

28:59.433 --> 29:01.217
Because I had to.

29:01.261 --> 29:05.221
And you know what?
I decided you were worth it.

29:07.528 --> 29:09.486
I'’m sorry if
that was a mistake.

29:22.499 --> 29:25.676
- Hey, I was looking
for you this morning.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.725
I wanted to talk to you about
what happened last night.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.813
- It won'’t happen again,
don'’t worry.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.467
- It'’s not a big deal at all.

29:33.510 --> 29:35.034
The most important thing
is for you to keep...

29:35.077 --> 29:36.949
- I told you.
It won'’t happen again.

29:36.992 --> 29:38.907
- For you to keep
finding your way.

29:38.951 --> 29:40.691
- Doesn'’t matter what I do.
You know that.

29:40.735 --> 29:42.650
- No, I don'’t know that.
- Nothing is going to change.

29:45.131 --> 29:47.742
- Because you can'’t
change what happened.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.355
- Don'’t! Could you wait
and just...

29:52.399 --> 29:53.792
talk to me, please?

29:59.058 --> 30:01.060
- I was a terrible soldier.
Do you know that?

30:01.103 --> 30:04.324
- No.

30:04.367 --> 30:06.369
- Those guys, they were
like my brothers.

30:06.413 --> 30:08.023
They were okay.
I was never okay.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.416
I was weak.

30:09.459 --> 30:10.460
Shouldn'’t have
sent me over there.

30:10.504 --> 30:11.679
I was a danger to all of them.

30:11.722 --> 30:12.854
- Stop it.
You know?

30:12.898 --> 30:14.595
You'’re some expert?
- No!

30:14.638 --> 30:18.860
All I know is that
then was then

30:18.904 --> 30:20.819
and now is now.

30:20.862 --> 30:24.692
It doesn'’t matter
what happened.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.868
You can'’t live
like it'’s then.

30:33.309 --> 30:36.399
- There was this patrol
in the south.

30:36.443 --> 30:38.793
Three times in one week,
everybody'’s bitchin'.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.926
Why we gotta go back
three times in one week?

30:40.969 --> 30:42.971
So this third time,
I look up.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.495
I see these two kids
looking out of a window.

30:45.539 --> 30:46.845
And I knew.
I turned to the sergeant.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.934
And I said, "We gotta stop."

30:48.977 --> 30:52.067
I didn'’t even get
the words outta my mouth.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.200
I didn'’t even hear
the explosion.

30:54.243 --> 30:59.379
It was like a whole Humvee
got just lifted into the air.

30:59.422 --> 31:02.382
Like this really
pissed off giant

31:02.425 --> 31:04.123
just lifted it into the air.

31:04.166 --> 31:05.385
And I'’m in this
washing machine

31:05.428 --> 31:07.300
going over and over
and upside down.

31:07.343 --> 31:10.651
And my teeth go
through my lip.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.174
Then my leg'’s burning.

31:12.218 --> 31:13.741
And I'’m thinking how
many times can I hit

31:13.784 --> 31:15.743
the inside of this thing?

31:15.786 --> 31:17.745
I can'’t hear a damn thing.

31:17.788 --> 31:21.749
And it all feels like it'’s
happening to somebody else.

31:21.792 --> 31:23.229
Well, Billy gets
the door open

31:23.272 --> 31:24.926
and he'’s pulling me out.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.754
And then there'’s rounds
hitting the dirt all around us.

31:26.797 --> 31:28.190
And I'’m just thinking
I need to be firing.

31:28.234 --> 31:30.323
I have to fire.

31:30.366 --> 31:32.325
But all I can see is
blood from my mouth

31:32.368 --> 31:35.763
pouring over the action
and down to the ejection port.

31:35.806 --> 31:38.331
And my finger'’s slipping
off the trigger.

31:38.374 --> 31:41.116
But, Billy, he just
pulls me out of the way.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.596
He thinks he'’s got a shot.

31:42.639 --> 31:44.554
And I just watch him,
boom, boom, boom.

31:44.598 --> 31:48.123
One, two, three,
boom, boom, boom.

31:48.167 --> 31:52.040
He'’s a machine and I'm
thinking how does he do that?

31:56.262 --> 31:59.482
Then his jaw'’s gone.

31:59.526 --> 32:02.921
Whole bottom half of his face
is gone just like that.

32:02.964 --> 32:08.100
And he'’s looking at me like,
well, what just happened?

32:08.143 --> 32:09.971
I don'’t even know.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.930
I'’m looking at the inside
of his head

32:11.973 --> 32:13.409
thinking that'’s
too much bleeding.

32:13.453 --> 32:16.412
I don'’t know how to stop
that much bleeding.

32:16.456 --> 32:17.674
While...

32:20.851 --> 32:23.985
While I'’m looking at him,
he'’s already dead.

32:26.031 --> 32:28.555
Dead from a round that
was meant for me.

32:30.861 --> 32:32.211
And when a
Blackhawk shows up,

32:32.254 --> 32:33.734
somebody'’s yelling
at me to go.

32:33.777 --> 32:34.778
And I can'’t.
I'’m holding onto him.

32:34.822 --> 32:36.215
And they'’re pulling me.

32:36.258 --> 32:39.783
And I'’m screaming,
"That'’s me! That is me!"

32:42.047 --> 32:44.701
They don'’t even know
what I'’m talking about.

32:44.745 --> 32:47.052
- I'’m so sorry.

32:48.705 --> 32:50.664
- I'’ll see you later.

33:00.021 --> 33:01.718
- You had a change of heart.

33:03.111 --> 33:04.460
- I'’m hearing you out.

33:05.853 --> 33:08.769
So, uh, how are Wendy
and the Lost Boys?

33:08.812 --> 33:10.510
Is there anybody left?

33:10.553 --> 33:12.512
- I can leave.

33:12.555 --> 33:15.036
- Come on.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.212
So, look, I'’ve been
doing this a long time.

33:17.256 --> 33:20.215
And when a talented young woman
joins up with a bunch of guys,

33:20.259 --> 33:23.958
it follows a certain
trajectory which you

33:24.002 --> 33:27.527
may be discovering on
an accelerated timeline.

33:27.570 --> 33:29.224
- Thanks for the insight.

33:29.268 --> 33:30.921
- Yeah. All I'’m saying is that
you might as well

33:30.965 --> 33:34.577
spare everybody the drama of
the long slow goodbye.

33:36.971 --> 33:38.320
You go solo right now,

33:38.364 --> 33:39.539
I'’ll put you with
my best producers

33:39.582 --> 33:41.193
and PR people in my stable

33:41.236 --> 33:43.369
to get your music out
there in the world.

33:43.412 --> 33:45.545
We'’ll have your first album
out in six months

33:45.588 --> 33:48.548
have you on tour
within a year.

33:48.591 --> 33:54.206
And to convince you
of my sincerity...

34:00.516 --> 34:04.651
And you get that whether or not
you ever sell a single album.

34:07.610 --> 34:10.657
So, you know, think about it.

34:15.183 --> 34:16.880
Sean?

34:16.924 --> 34:18.143
- Hey, I'’m here!

34:19.579 --> 34:20.928
- Hey, um...

34:22.538 --> 34:24.714
I'’m so sorry I pushed you.

34:24.758 --> 34:26.281
I didn'’t know
what you'’d been through.

34:26.325 --> 34:28.849
If you wanna live out
your days here to get away

34:28.892 --> 34:31.982
from people and have some
peace, you deserve to.

34:32.026 --> 34:35.160
- It'’s okay.
I'’ll keep singing.

34:37.423 --> 34:39.555
- '’Cause Scarlett
told me I had to.

34:39.599 --> 34:41.122
- Oh, come on, dude.
Shut up.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.168
- Well, you said I can'’t
keep living in the past.

34:43.211 --> 34:45.648
I have no idea how to do that.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.476
But, obviously, you are right.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.652
- I don'’t wanna be right.

34:49.696 --> 34:52.133
I just want you to have
something good in your life.

34:53.569 --> 34:55.615
- You tell me something.

34:57.486 --> 34:59.271
- I told you,
I never wanted it.

34:59.314 --> 35:00.620
Not like you.

35:00.663 --> 35:01.838
- I don'’t believe you.

35:01.882 --> 35:03.797
- No.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.800
Matter of fact, I think
you'’re living in the past.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.898
- Thanks for coming over.
- Hey, yeah.

35:20.379 --> 35:22.294
Sorry I got frustrated
the other day.

35:22.337 --> 35:25.166
- No, no. You had every
reason to be frustrated.

35:27.734 --> 35:32.086
Listen, Deacon,
I can'’t solve this.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.480
- Okay. Well, I told you
I'’d pay for a lawyer.

35:34.523 --> 35:35.959
- And I'’m beholden
to you for that.

35:36.003 --> 35:38.875
But I can'’t put
Jake on the stand.

35:38.919 --> 35:41.878
And more than that,
I can'’t take the chance...

35:43.489 --> 35:45.230
- That you'’d lose him.

35:45.273 --> 35:47.710
- Yeah. I literally don'’t
think he could...

35:47.754 --> 35:49.669
he'’d survive it.

35:54.587 --> 35:59.113
We just... stop?

35:59.157 --> 36:00.854
- I think so, yeah.

36:02.508 --> 36:04.553
- I don'’t wanna.
- Neither do I.

36:14.868 --> 36:17.131
Maybe we could just
pretend to stop.

36:18.872 --> 36:21.222
- Yeah.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.702
- Mm-hmm.

36:22.745 --> 36:23.703
- I mean, it'’s nobody's
business, is it?

36:23.746 --> 36:24.921
- It'’s not.

36:26.401 --> 36:30.275
- But you'’d have
to lie to your girls.

36:30.318 --> 36:32.102
- You'’d have to lie to Jake.

36:32.146 --> 36:34.279
We'’d have to ask him
to lie for us.

36:34.322 --> 36:36.063
- It'’s not fair.

36:41.677 --> 36:43.026
- I'’m sorry.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.550
- No. You didn'’t do anything.

36:44.593 --> 36:47.248
- I did. I kind of did.
- My life is such a mess.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.511
I'’m sorry I ever
met that man!

36:49.555 --> 36:52.862
- Come here, come here.
- Oh, Deacon...

36:52.906 --> 36:54.908
- We'’ll see what
happens, all right?

36:54.951 --> 36:56.736
- Okay.
- Maybe something'’ll change.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.529
I'’m gonna go.
- I'’m so sorry.

37:07.573 --> 37:08.748
I'’m sorry for everything.

37:08.791 --> 37:10.228
- No, Jessie.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.843
I'’m gonna go.
We'’ll talk.

37:19.715 --> 37:21.195
I'’ll call you.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.789
- Gunnar! Come on!

37:53.619 --> 37:55.534
Gunnar! Come on, man!

37:56.883 --> 37:58.667
Gunnar, open the door.

38:02.889 --> 38:04.586
You'’re up.

38:04.630 --> 38:07.415
- Two, one, we'’re on.

38:07.459 --> 38:09.809
- Welcome back to "Nashville'’s
Next Country Star".

38:09.852 --> 38:11.985
Say hello to our
youngest contestant!

38:19.949 --> 38:22.691
- She looks so beautiful.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.998
- Well, hello there, darlin'’.
What'’s your name?

38:25.041 --> 38:26.129
- Daphne Conrad.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.828
- I'’m 14 years old.

38:28.871 --> 38:31.221
- Yes, 14.

38:31.265 --> 38:33.136
- What are you gonna sing
for us today, Daphne?

38:33.180 --> 38:35.878
- A song that I wrote
for my mom.

38:35.922 --> 38:37.532
It'’s called "Memories Crash".

38:37.576 --> 38:40.013
What inspired you
to write that?

38:40.056 --> 38:42.494
- Well, my mom
passed last year.

38:42.537 --> 38:45.279
And I'’ve just been
really missing her. So...

38:48.413 --> 38:50.328
I thought it'’d
be nice to just show her

38:50.371 --> 38:52.242
how I'’ve been feeling.

38:52.286 --> 38:53.722
- She'’s okay.

38:53.766 --> 38:54.854
- You know, that'’s
beautiful, Daphne.

38:54.897 --> 38:58.510
Did she play
at all herself?

38:58.553 --> 39:00.033
- Yes.

39:00.076 --> 39:02.078
Um, my mom was Rayna James.

39:05.517 --> 39:08.389
- Now I'’m just...
Wait a minute, wait.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.435
The Rayna James?

39:10.478 --> 39:14.700
I guess we'’re in for some
kind of a treat today, huh?

39:14.743 --> 39:16.266
All right, Daphne, honey,
whenever you'’re ready.

39:16.310 --> 39:17.485
Go on.

Daphne, I gotta tell you
that was some kind of beautiful.

40:54.713 --> 40:57.019
And you get a great
big yes from me!

40:57.063 --> 40:58.717
- Thank you.

- Daphne, I just don'’t
know what to say.

41:05.854 --> 41:08.422
I'’m speechless.
Absolutely, yes.

41:14.428 --> 41:16.561
- Thank you.

41:33.839 --> 41:35.057
