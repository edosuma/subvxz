05:17.384 --> 05:19.584
Shanner opposed
nuclear warfare

05:19.619 --> 05:21.486

-Let's do this.
-Yes, I would be saying that,

old-fashioned pool party.
Am I right?

06:01.694 --> 06:03.995
Why are you doing this?
I mean, there's better ways
to barbecue

06:04.030 --> 06:06.698
than by causing
a nuclear meltdown.

Uh, no.

06:11.504 --> 06:13.638
It's like this, Sparky.

we've been a family,

06:15.675 --> 06:17.208
Mom, the kiddos and I...

06:17.243 --> 06:20.578
Well, we've been wanting
a little place we could
call home.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.747
Oh, it was so hard
living on the run.

06:22.782 --> 06:26.184
Squatting in fallout shelters
and hazardous waste dumps.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.753
Certainly no way to raise
a growing family.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.522
Then, Dad brought us here.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.190
Isn't it awesome?

06:32.225 --> 06:35.160
And now,
we're gonna blow it up.

wipe out half the state!

Sure, it'll be a little toasty
for the folks outside,

06:42.535 --> 06:44.102
but here's the good news.

06:44.137 --> 06:47.772
We can finally live in peace
in a radioactive wasteland.

Our radioactive wasteland.

06:59.352 --> 07:03.054
Interesting. The androids

The more you struggle,
the more power
the reactor absorbs.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.092
Okay, so how do I break free?

07:08.127 --> 07:11.162
A super charge to
the fuel rod pool might do it.

07:11.197 --> 07:13.097
Say, from one of the androids?

07:13.132 --> 07:16.134
Uh, I don't see any of them
jumping in the pool to play
Marco Polo.
