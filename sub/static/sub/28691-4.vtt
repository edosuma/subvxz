WEBVTT

00:00.984 --> 00:03.881
There you go! On the house.

00:03.906 --> 00:05.975
- What's the occasion?
- When you bake a tray

00:06.000 --> 00:08.453
of spiced triple A beef

00:08.478 --> 00:11.973
enrobed in puff pastry,
that is the occasion.

00:11.998 --> 00:14.332
So you're taking over
the kitchen now?

00:14.357 --> 00:17.192
No! Just while Shona's son is
visiting from Trinidad.

00:17.268 --> 00:19.094
I thought, if I'm gonna
run this joint solo,

00:19.119 --> 00:21.429
I may as well float a
few recipes of my own.

00:21.454 --> 00:24.650
- A man of many talents, Don!
- Enjoy!

00:26.661 --> 00:29.114
- Let's get back to the office.
- Yeah, okay.

00:30.448 --> 00:33.511
On second thought, why don't
we stay here for a minute?

00:33.536 --> 00:35.943
I'm sure Zoe has
everything under control.

00:35.968 --> 00:37.705
Not so fast, Chow.

00:38.798 --> 00:42.683
Okay, I know the office is technically
supposed to be open right now,

00:42.708 --> 00:44.433
but I thought you were
doing this at Timmy's.

00:44.458 --> 00:47.001
- It's after nine!
- I know. I just...

00:47.026 --> 00:50.535
My stupid phone's new operating
system messed up my alarm. But,

00:50.560 --> 00:54.124
don't worry, I forwarded the
agency's calls to my phone!

00:54.149 --> 00:56.682
Speaking of which, do
you know Riley Larson?

00:56.837 --> 00:58.915
If I never hear from that
over coiffed jackass again

00:58.940 --> 01:00.997
it'll be too soon. Why?

01:01.040 --> 01:04.269
- Because he just hired us.
- Ah...

01:06.672 --> 01:10.056
- How much are we paying her again?
- Define "jackass."

01:10.081 --> 01:12.713
Designer suit. Too much
cologne. Excessive use

01:12.738 --> 01:14.794
- of the word "broski".
- Well...

01:14.819 --> 01:17.458
- And how do you know this guy?
- Riley's a Bay Street

01:17.483 --> 01:19.792
criminal lawyer my dad and
I worked for a few times.

01:19.817 --> 01:21.341
He reps the scum of the earth,

01:21.366 --> 01:23.521
and he is pretty good at
keeping them out of jail.

01:23.546 --> 01:25.724
With an assist
from the Everett Agency.

01:25.749 --> 01:28.412
- His cheques never bounced!
- So what does he want with us?

01:28.437 --> 01:30.231
Apparently Riley opened
a new practice.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.942
He wants us to find
out who threw a brick

01:31.967 --> 01:34.480
through his front window. Which
narrows our suspect list

01:34.505 --> 01:36.932
down to anybody he's ever met.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074

01:47.099 --> 01:51.349
Unionville, uh? Not exactly
what I was expecting.

01:51.374 --> 01:55.325
Me neither. The Riley I knew was
more of a glass and concrete guy.

01:55.350 --> 01:58.666
- Why would he set up shop here?
- Nicely gentrified.

01:58.691 --> 02:00.788
Lots of new money. I get the attraction.

02:00.813 --> 02:03.436
Yeah, if you're opening a
bakery or a ye olde fudge shop,

02:03.461 --> 02:07.162
not a law firm. Zoe must've
got the wrong address.

02:07.187 --> 02:09.756
No! I don't think so.

02:11.084 --> 02:13.635
Riley's Flying Motorcycle Club?

02:13.660 --> 02:17.260
So your buddy's a biker now?

02:17.285 --> 02:19.723
- He's not my buddy.
- There's the broken window!

02:22.329 --> 02:23.897
(KNOCKING)

02:24.955 --> 02:27.216
There's something really weird
about all this.

02:27.241 --> 02:29.514
Maybe there's a back entrance.

02:30.212 --> 02:31.947
It's open.

02:34.440 --> 02:36.287
Hello?

02:37.384 --> 02:39.119
Riley?

02:40.920 --> 02:42.706
Hello?

02:43.860 --> 02:45.528
Angie.

02:46.727 --> 02:48.694
Is that meant for us?

02:48.719 --> 02:50.755
Is that some kind of joke?

02:50.915 --> 02:55.302
Well, it is, the joke's on me.

03:36.858 --> 03:38.663
- I was coming here to meet you

03:38.688 --> 03:40.588
to talk about the brick

03:40.613 --> 03:42.847
when I heard a noise at my workbench.

03:42.872 --> 03:45.393
I went to check it out and
got coldcocked by a helmet.

03:45.418 --> 03:49.086
- Did you see his face?
- No. He got me by surprise.

03:49.111 --> 03:51.045
I wouldn't have figured you
for the biker.

03:51.070 --> 03:53.484
Back in the day you used
to live in a suit and tie.

03:53.509 --> 03:56.264
- I quit law last year.
- You quit? Why?

03:56.289 --> 03:57.863
- What're you, my shrink?
- Hey!

03:57.888 --> 04:00.700
Easy, bro. We're just trying
to get a little backstory.

04:00.725 --> 04:02.944
I'm not your "bro".
And here's your backstory:

04:02.969 --> 04:05.206
I opened a new business,
and someone wants me out.

04:05.231 --> 04:09.410
- I can't imagine why.
- Look. I'm tired of these yokels

04:09.435 --> 04:11.132
treating us like a gang, alright!

04:11.157 --> 04:13.633
My members are good people,
they don't deserve this.

04:13.658 --> 04:15.144
Maybe it's just you
they don't like.

04:15.169 --> 04:18.676
Hey, hey, hey! Tell us about
the window out front.

04:20.738 --> 04:23.238
It happened yesterday around 7 AM.

04:23.539 --> 04:25.879
I was back here when I heard a crash.

04:25.904 --> 04:29.728
I went out, found glass everywhere.
And also this.

04:36.627 --> 04:38.787
At least they're consistent.

04:39.177 --> 04:41.745
If you're so worried, why
haven't you call the police?

04:41.770 --> 04:43.730
That's funny. You know how many cops
I've taken apart

04:43.755 --> 04:46.123
on the witness stand?
They already hate me,

04:46.148 --> 04:48.559
- and that was before the rally.
- What rally?

04:48.584 --> 04:50.458
I'm hosting a vintage
motorcycle rally tomorrow.

04:50.483 --> 04:53.336
Closing down the whole street.
It's gonna be great for tourism.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.168
Maybe this has something to do
with that.

04:55.193 --> 04:57.393
All I know is if this were
anywhere else in the city,

04:57.425 --> 04:59.191
they'd be putting up a
plaque in my honour.

04:59.216 --> 05:02.219
Instead they hold a protest
at the community centre.

05:02.265 --> 05:03.804
They who?

05:05.570 --> 05:07.588
For twelve years,
our community has

05:07.613 --> 05:10.199
been among the safest in
the greater Toronto area.

05:10.224 --> 05:12.804
But since the arrival of Mr. Larson,

05:12.829 --> 05:14.613
there have been noise violations,

05:14.638 --> 05:17.038
unruly activity at our local pubs,

05:17.063 --> 05:20.095
and a dramatic increase in
crime, including vandalism

05:20.120 --> 05:21.433
and assault.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.917
What are you talking about?
Both of those attacks were

05:23.942 --> 05:26.542
- against my club!
- Part of a pattern of violence

05:26.567 --> 05:29.418
- that started when you arrived.
- Sit down, lady!

05:29.443 --> 05:32.144
As leader of the Unionville
Preservation Society,

05:32.169 --> 05:34.303
I'm asking one last time

05:34.328 --> 05:37.660
to cancel this reckless bike
rally tomorrow. Thank you.

05:37.685 --> 05:41.342
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:41.367 --> 05:44.709
Alright! Settle! Settle!
Settle! Thank you, Wendy.

05:44.734 --> 05:47.316
We'll take your words under advisement.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.785
- Mr. O'Connor?
- I manage

05:49.810 --> 05:53.480
the Unionville Arms Pub,
and Riley's club has been

05:53.505 --> 05:55.730
the best thing that's happened to us.
Sales are way up.

05:55.755 --> 06:00.105
What? Speak for yourself!
My boutique has lost

06:00.130 --> 06:03.160
- nearly half its revenue.
- Think long term, Lola.

06:03.185 --> 06:05.293
This rally will bring in
all kinds of tourists.

06:05.318 --> 06:08.202
Yeah, tattooed hoodlums
from Millhaven!

06:09.845 --> 06:12.324
(FEEDBACK)

06:12.736 --> 06:15.230
Little trick
from my punk band days.

06:16.255 --> 06:19.538
Now I know some of you are concerned

06:19.563 --> 06:21.800
with the number of bikers
showing up tomorrow,

06:21.825 --> 06:25.574
but Mr. O'Connor has graciously
donated his parking lot as overflow.

06:25.599 --> 06:27.581
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

06:27.606 --> 06:30.247
And Riley has also promised

06:30.272 --> 06:34.267
that all proceeds from the rally
will be donated to charity.

06:34.292 --> 06:36.497
The charity in his pocket!

06:36.522 --> 06:38.582
Riley never mentioned a charity.

06:38.607 --> 06:41.208
Weird. He's not one to hide
things that make him look good.

06:41.233 --> 06:44.184
Alright, alright.
That's enough. That's enough!

06:44.366 --> 06:46.990
As I was saying, in my opinion,

06:47.733 --> 06:51.203
the benefits of holding the
rally outweigh the risks.

06:51.344 --> 06:54.597
The council's decision stands.
The rally is on.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.376
(APPLAUSE)

07:04.363 --> 07:07.587
Our fearless leader has a temper.
You think she's behind this?

07:07.612 --> 07:10.190
I don't know. I can't see her
swinging a helmet.

07:10.215 --> 07:13.308
And I can't see you doing Soul Cycle,
but life is full of surprises.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.230
I am really regretting
telling you that.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.181
Her name is Wendy Meisner.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.942
She's the leader of the
Unionville Preservation Society.

07:22.967 --> 07:25.135
Yeah? Well, my name is Kurtis
Mazhari, and I'm the leader

07:25.160 --> 07:27.805
of the local chapter of the
I-Don't-Give-A-Rat's-Ass Society,

07:27.830 --> 07:29.369
- alright?
- Come on, Maz!

07:29.394 --> 07:30.393
It'll take you two minutes.

07:30.418 --> 07:32.195
We just wanna see if
she's got any priors.

07:32.220 --> 07:35.893
I can't do it, alright? Inspector
Carson's been cracking down on me.

07:35.918 --> 07:37.979
Every login to the network is monitored.

07:38.004 --> 07:40.420
Besides, she eats private
eyes for breakfast.

07:40.445 --> 07:42.517
Now I gotta deal with this
on top of everything else.

07:42.687 --> 07:44.260
Who's the newbie?

07:44.285 --> 07:47.801
Danica Powers. Some uniform
headquarters dumped on us

07:47.826 --> 07:49.762
for a week. She's doing
that to be a detective.

07:49.787 --> 07:51.315
Can we use her login?

07:51.340 --> 07:53.557
That could not be more
against work policy.

07:53.582 --> 07:55.226
Come on, Maz.
Don't make me post a pic

07:55.251 --> 07:57.955
of a certain detective
rocking a vintage bowl cut.

07:57.980 --> 07:59.521
You're bluffing.

08:00.588 --> 08:02.717
- Powers! Get over here.
- Yes, sir?

08:02.742 --> 08:04.767
Why don't you set out to my
computer and log into your account?

08:04.792 --> 08:07.655
You want to be a detective, right?
Let's do a little dry run, uh!

08:07.680 --> 08:09.531
- Okay!
- Okay! Right! Yeah!

08:09.556 --> 08:12.517
This is Shade and Angie, two of my...

08:12.542 --> 08:14.979
- confidential informants.
- Hello!

08:15.004 --> 08:17.238
Fakes names, of course. Go ahead.

08:18.487 --> 08:22.017
Okay! We're looking for some
information on a Wendy...

08:22.042 --> 08:25.298
Meisner, founder of the
Unionville Preservation Society.

08:25.368 --> 08:28.869
Actually, yes. One incident
of malicious destruction

08:28.894 --> 08:31.291
of property, later dropped.
Looks like she smashed

08:31.316 --> 08:33.667
some of her ex-husband's artwork
during a messy divorce.

08:33.692 --> 08:35.205
What's this about?

08:35.230 --> 08:38.385
We're just looking
into some death threats.

08:38.409 --> 08:40.477
- It's probably nothing.
- What's the case number?

08:40.501 --> 08:44.221
Uh, 867-5309.

08:45.289 --> 08:47.814
- Okay! I'll log that right now!
- No need. No need!

08:47.839 --> 08:50.323
I will take care of it. That's
plenty for today. Great work.

08:50.348 --> 08:52.682
- Ha! Ha! Thank you, Sir!
- Yeah!

08:52.707 --> 08:56.037
Yeah, that's not... There's...
That's the door right there.

08:56.593 --> 08:58.931
I would hardly call it art.

08:58.956 --> 09:02.125
It was a hideous anime space
girl with giant fake boobs.

09:02.173 --> 09:06.073
- You don't deny smashing it.
- I wanted his things out of my house

09:06.098 --> 09:07.979
and I "accidentally damaged it".

09:08.004 --> 09:10.725
The way you "accidentally
assaulted" Riley Larson?

09:10.750 --> 09:12.584
No. I swear I wasn't there.

09:12.609 --> 09:15.142
Then you won't mind telling us
where you were this morning at 9:30?

09:15.167 --> 09:17.707
- I was having breakfast.
- With who?

09:17.747 --> 09:19.851
<i>My friend, Lola Melloncamp.</i>

09:21.267 --> 09:24.134
Yes, Wendy and I met at the
Unionville Arms this morning.

09:24.159 --> 09:25.299
They have a great Early Bird.

09:25.324 --> 09:27.018
You don't seem to like
Riley much either.

09:27.043 --> 09:27.955
Or the rally.

09:27.980 --> 09:30.221
My boutique sells high-end
clothing and jewelry.

09:30.246 --> 09:32.640
Some are estate sale pieces
that are extremely valuable.

09:32.665 --> 09:34.580
My clients hate the sound
of revving engines

09:34.605 --> 09:36.828
almost as much as Lou Lou here. Yes.

09:36.942 --> 09:38.786
I have no choice but to
close my shop tomorrow.

09:38.811 --> 09:42.347
What about yesterday? Someone threw
a brick through Riley's window.

09:42.372 --> 09:45.419
- I was sleeping when it happened.
- We didn't mention the time.

09:45.444 --> 09:48.714
I heard about it, okay? Why
are you only questioning me?

09:48.780 --> 09:51.166
- Lots of people have it in for Riley.
- Why is that?

09:51.191 --> 09:54.142
Because he's a scam artist.
You wanna know how to tell

09:54.167 --> 09:57.494
if Riley Larson is lying?
His lips are moving.

09:59.071 --> 10:02.622
Ugh... Classic Riley. Making
friends wherever he goes.

10:02.647 --> 10:04.416
What do you suppose
she meant by that?

10:04.441 --> 10:06.799
I don't know, but my money's
on the charity rally.

10:06.824 --> 10:08.471
Doesn't jive with the
Riley Larson I know.

10:08.496 --> 10:09.588
You think it's a scam?

10:09.613 --> 10:11.386
Explains why he didn't tell us about it.

10:11.411 --> 10:14.157
So how do you think we are
gonna get to the truth?

10:14.810 --> 10:16.674
Why don't we ask somebody?

10:16.699 --> 10:20.236
Whoa. You really think
confronting a bunch of bikers

10:20.261 --> 10:22.893
on their home turf is such a great idea?

10:22.918 --> 10:24.627
You got a better one?

10:24.917 --> 10:29.087
(ROCK MUSIC)

10:36.349 --> 10:40.406
Hey! Welcome. I'm Tiny. Are you
signing up for tomorrow's rally?

10:40.431 --> 10:44.187
You bet, we are! Always happy
to support local charity!

10:44.758 --> 10:46.731
Which one is it again?

10:46.889 --> 10:49.257
All proceeds are going
to the Harbour Women's Shelter.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.901
It's a cause close to Riley's heart.

10:50.926 --> 10:53.154
Is there a website
we could check out?

10:53.395 --> 10:55.948
- You guys cops?
- No.

10:55.973 --> 10:58.885
- What's your ride?
- A Honda.

10:58.910 --> 11:01.578
- Yeah? What kind?
- It's a...

11:02.124 --> 11:05.739
- Uh... It's a...
- It's a Honda Gold Wing

11:05.764 --> 11:08.251
Valkyrie, the power cruiser from hell.
1500 CC's,

11:08.276 --> 11:12.589
she tops out at about 210.
Isn't that right, honey?

11:12.931 --> 11:14.800
Yeah, it's right.

11:15.481 --> 11:17.076
- Sweet ride.
- Yeah!

11:17.101 --> 11:20.222
Well. Sign up here,
leave the sheet there

11:20.247 --> 11:23.726
and I'll see you two tomorrow.

11:26.694 --> 11:28.543
Thanks, Tiny!

11:30.155 --> 11:31.656
What the hell was that?

11:31.681 --> 11:35.419
I'm a car guy! Motorcycles are
two wheeled death traps.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.581
Fine! And I do all the talking
starting now!

11:37.606 --> 11:39.742
It's the last thing we need
to see you blow our cover.

11:39.926 --> 11:41.944
Shadow?

11:47.880 --> 11:51.347
Dude, I am like
so geeking out here.

11:51.372 --> 11:54.224
Matt Shade, in my bar, man!
I can't... I got your...

11:54.249 --> 11:57.384
I got your card in here somewhere.

11:58.237 --> 12:00.446
- You a big fan of the Tropics?
- Yeah.

12:00.471 --> 12:03.677
That's Maui. One day I'm gonna
open up a tiki bar there.

12:03.702 --> 12:04.731
Somewhere they don't care

12:04.756 --> 12:07.489
- who your clientele is, right?
- As a bartender,

12:07.514 --> 12:11.189
you must hear things. Any
idea who's after Riley?

12:11.214 --> 12:12.747
Believe me, I've been listening.

12:12.772 --> 12:15.527
So far no one's owning up.

12:15.904 --> 12:17.606
Here we go.

12:17.638 --> 12:19.981
I really appreciate this.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.714
Yeah, no problem. So...

12:23.249 --> 12:26.622
do you know Lola Mellencamp
and Wendy Meisner?

12:26.647 --> 12:29.181
Sure. Lola's a regular.

12:29.206 --> 12:31.473
Wendy comes in for breakfast sometimes.

12:31.498 --> 12:34.096
- Like today.
- Today? No. I open late

12:34.121 --> 12:36.424
- on Fridays.
- Thanks, man.

12:36.449 --> 12:38.308
Thank you!

12:44.781 --> 12:47.815
- So Wendy has no alibi at all.
- More importantly,

12:47.840 --> 12:50.776
she chose to lie. And got her
friend Lola to cover it up.

12:50.801 --> 12:52.898
Let's check it out.

13:13.833 --> 13:16.087
Look familiar?

13:17.007 --> 13:19.241
What the hell is going on
out here?

13:19.266 --> 13:21.426
We were just about to ask you
the same thing.

13:21.451 --> 13:23.401
Tan brownstones, exactly like the one

13:23.426 --> 13:25.502
that was thrown through Riley's window.

13:25.527 --> 13:28.260
- Why did you lie about your alibi?
- I have my reasons.

13:28.285 --> 13:31.102
Our client needs to know.
You got ten seconds.

13:31.817 --> 13:34.104
Because she was with me.

13:40.924 --> 13:45.088
Wendy and I have spent
a lot of time together.

13:45.275 --> 13:49.267
- My job is to build bridges.
- Into your arch enemy's bedroom?

13:49.292 --> 13:51.182
It's complicated. We represent

13:51.207 --> 13:54.179
two very passionate bases.

13:54.204 --> 13:57.306
And though Bryce is
friendly with the bikers,

13:57.331 --> 14:01.338
I've come to realize he can be a
lot more reasonable than some

14:01.363 --> 14:03.658
- of my own group.
- And vice versa.

14:03.683 --> 14:06.174
We started to understand each other.

14:06.199 --> 14:08.657
And somewhere along the
way, there were sparks.

14:08.682 --> 14:09.891
Sometimes work can

14:09.916 --> 14:13.523
bring out chemistry in unexpected ways.

14:13.963 --> 14:15.924
You must know what that's like.

14:15.949 --> 14:18.675
- No! No. No idea.
- No, no idea.

14:18.700 --> 14:22.893
My members at the Unionville
Preservation Society would have a fit

14:22.918 --> 14:25.666
if they knew that Bryce
and I were romantic.

14:25.691 --> 14:28.814
- They'd think I sold out.
- Only Lola knows

14:28.839 --> 14:32.122
about our relationship. And
we'd like to keep it that way.

14:32.147 --> 14:34.401
Maybe if you guys were more forthcoming

14:34.426 --> 14:36.375
about where you were this morning.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.698
We were here, during the assault.

14:38.948 --> 14:42.370
Together. Is that
forthcoming enough for you?

14:43.150 --> 14:45.065
What about the broken window?

14:45.090 --> 14:47.242
She had nothing to do
with that either.

14:47.267 --> 14:49.018
Tell them, Wendy.

14:51.060 --> 14:53.019
Wendy?

14:53.732 --> 14:56.333
- Are you serious?
- I only did it

14:56.365 --> 14:59.953
because some in my group
thought I was getting soft.

14:59.978 --> 15:03.635
I was planning on paying
Riley back anonymously.

15:04.797 --> 15:07.992
If I was you, I'd get
your chequebook out.

15:12.329 --> 15:15.666
Wendy Meisner. Wow.

15:16.573 --> 15:20.329
So you know who threw the brick, but
you don't know who assaulted me.

15:20.760 --> 15:23.236
Which means you may wanna
consider canceling the rally.

15:23.261 --> 15:25.718
No. I'm not canceling my rally.

15:25.816 --> 15:27.542
Look. I sunk a ton of
money into this club,

15:27.567 --> 15:28.815
the rally's the whole point.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.143
Because of the charity?

15:30.168 --> 15:32.948
That's what this is about, isn't it?
You're running a scam.

15:32.973 --> 15:36.339
It's not a scam, okay? Feel
free to look at the paperwork.

15:36.364 --> 15:39.401
- Why a women's shelter?
- Because it ticks all the right boxes.

15:39.426 --> 15:41.206
PR gold in the Me Too era.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.508
Not buying it. There's
something else going on.

15:43.533 --> 15:46.529
That's what I'm paying you
to find out!

15:47.541 --> 15:51.057
I'm sorry. Old habits.

15:51.157 --> 15:53.224
I'm trying to change, Angie, believe me.

15:53.249 --> 15:56.332
It's just... this rally
is everything to me.

15:59.852 --> 16:02.170
I'll pay you double to keep watch,

16:02.195 --> 16:05.716
whatever it takes. But I'm
not canceling my rally.

16:10.198 --> 16:14.224
(MUMBLING)

16:19.353 --> 16:21.579
Detective Mazhari? I was wondering

16:21.604 --> 16:22.940
if you needed any further help

16:22.965 --> 16:24.955
on that Wendy Meisner death threat case.

16:24.980 --> 16:27.573
- No, I'm good. Thank you.
- Are you sure?

16:27.598 --> 16:29.908
Because when I mentioned
it to Inspector Carson...

16:29.933 --> 16:32.545
- You told Inspector Carson?
- Sure.

16:32.570 --> 16:34.786
She asked me for the file number
but I couldn't seem to find it

16:34.811 --> 16:38.958
in the system. You've
opened a file, right?

16:38.983 --> 16:41.293
867-5309?

16:41.331 --> 16:44.254
It's still just a hard copy
right now, you know.

16:44.279 --> 16:48.174
Analog. Gotta input the data into the...

16:48.866 --> 16:51.093
Yeah. Okay. So... Okay.

16:51.118 --> 16:53.065
Just let me know when it's
up because I definitely want

16:53.090 --> 16:55.510
to keep Carson in the loop. You know.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.705
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

17:07.678 --> 17:10.614
Angie? Help.

17:10.852 --> 17:12.633
(POP ROCK MUSIC)

17:12.771 --> 17:15.891
- Ha! Ha! It's not my fault.
- What do you mean, it's not your fault?

17:15.915 --> 17:18.281
You're the one who made me look into
Wendy Meisner in the first place.

17:18.307 --> 17:20.284
- Now my rookie is all over this.
- And here she comes.

17:20.309 --> 17:21.541
Right behind.

17:21.758 --> 17:24.406
Perimeter check completed,
no suspicious activity detected.

17:24.432 --> 17:29.800
Hey, Danica. Why don't you
take five and get us a round?

17:30.995 --> 17:34.096
Thank you. That's very nice.
Thank you.

17:38.508 --> 17:40.388
Does she have an off switch?

17:40.413 --> 17:41.883
You don't know the half of it.

17:41.908 --> 17:43.820
She's at work every morning
before everybody else,

17:43.845 --> 17:45.805
she leaves last, and every lunch break,

17:45.830 --> 17:47.813
she shows me new videos
or her and her girlfriend

17:47.838 --> 17:50.904
bottle-feeding their baby
pugs, Cameron and Diaz.

17:50.997 --> 17:52.657
She'll be gone in a week.

17:52.682 --> 17:54.616
Plus look at the bright side,
you get to hang out with us

17:54.641 --> 17:56.951
and Carson will never find out
you faked that file number.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.204
I'm sorry. Which part of that
is the bright side?

17:59.592 --> 18:03.501
Oh! Danica needs more money.
That's great. I'm dead now. So...

18:06.726 --> 18:09.704
Whoa, check it out. A
1972 Norton Commando.

18:09.729 --> 18:10.563
Alright!

18:10.588 --> 18:12.235
Hold the phone!

18:12.260 --> 18:14.714
When were you gonna tell me
you were this into bikes?

18:14.739 --> 18:18.041
Oh! I'm not. It's my dad's
thing. He used to take me

18:18.066 --> 18:20.199
for picnic road trips up the escarpment.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.560
Uh! You still ride?

18:24.750 --> 18:26.851
Just because your dad's
gone, doesn't mean

18:26.876 --> 18:28.607
you have to give up what you love.

18:30.675 --> 18:33.447
Two beers for our fellow
colleagues.

18:33.472 --> 18:37.117
And because Danica correctly
pointed out we're on duty,

18:37.142 --> 18:41.344
- two sodas for us. Yeah! Cheers!
- Cheers!

coat, four o'clock.

He's bringing back the Bogart look.
That's not a crime.

18:51.369 --> 18:53.719
It's way too hot for riding.

18:53.744 --> 18:57.094
- He's got a gun! Detective Mazhari!
- What?

18:59.930 --> 19:02.796
Shoot. We lost him.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.146
I got him!

19:09.492 --> 19:12.031
- What the hell are you doing?
- This man's got a firearm!

19:12.056 --> 19:16.906
Okay! Yeah,
it's a starter's pistol.

Sergeant Earle Capshaw,

Star of Courage recipient

19:23.361 --> 19:25.992
and the man we've honoured
with kicking off our rally.

19:26.017 --> 19:27.024
Hello.

19:27.049 --> 19:29.101
What kind of outfit
are you running here?

19:29.126 --> 19:30.969
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry about that, Sir.

19:31.367 --> 19:32.914
Nice work, officer.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.173
- Thank you, Sir!
- Sarcastic!

19:34.198 --> 19:35.843
I think I jumped the gun
a little bit there.

19:35.868 --> 19:39.012
Don't sneak out. Don't sneak
out again today.

I appreciate it.

Yeah. Unless you're
a Gulf War veteran.

20:53.858 --> 20:55.588
Go easy on her.
She was just excited.

20:55.613 --> 20:57.591
Alright, let's get the hell
outta here and find Riley

20:57.616 --> 20:59.384
before one of us takes out a nun.

- What's going on?
- (SIREN BLARING)

21:04.490 --> 21:06.684
I got no idea.

21:09.448 --> 21:13.022
Oh! Heads up! Clear the way! Yeah.

21:18.242 --> 21:20.475
- What happened?
- What do you think happened?

21:20.500 --> 21:23.844
I was right all along. Come on, sweetie.

21:27.742 --> 21:30.082
Looks like one
of the bikers used the rally

21:30.107 --> 21:31.806
as a distraction to rob Lola's shop.

21:31.831 --> 21:34.157
That's not good news for
Riley. We should go tell him.

21:34.182 --> 21:36.337
You don't have to do that.

21:40.687 --> 21:43.011
I think he already knows.

21:47.524 --> 21:51.438
I got a message from Lola saying
she had info about the assault.

21:51.704 --> 21:54.398
- Can we see it?
- It was on FlashYak.

21:54.423 --> 21:58.086
It's a messaging app. It disappears
ten seconds after it's sent.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.279
She asked me to come
to her shop right away.

22:00.304 --> 22:02.313
Told me to use the back
door, said it was unlocked.

22:02.338 --> 22:05.813
- That didn't seem weird to you?
- No. She's let me in that way before.

22:07.251 --> 22:09.663
Lola and I were briefly romantic.

22:09.688 --> 22:12.644
And you don't think we could've
used this information earlier?

22:12.669 --> 22:13.868
When was I supposed to tell you?

22:13.893 --> 22:17.280
- Literally any time before now.
- Lola and I are fine.

22:17.305 --> 22:20.000
- We parted as friends.
- Yeah! 'Cause that's your strong suit.

22:20.025 --> 22:21.134
Don't get me started...

22:21.159 --> 22:24.692
Hey! Hey, hey! What happened
after you got inside?

22:25.423 --> 22:28.047
Okay. I knew something was
wrong right away.

22:28.431 --> 22:31.560
I saw glass on the floor, and no Lola.
I started to worry.

22:31.585 --> 22:34.104
- Why didn't you call the cops?
- I didn't think of it, alright.

22:34.129 --> 22:35.892
I wanted to make sure Lola was okay,

22:35.917 --> 22:38.441
so I went right over to
the smashed display case.

22:38.466 --> 22:40.528
- That's when I saw my satchel...
- Your satchel?

22:40.553 --> 22:43.055
I swear to God, I don't know
how it got there.

22:43.079 --> 22:45.470
I picked it up, and realized
I was being set up.

soup would kill! Ha! Ha!

had her movie nights,

(LOUD EXHALE)

23:25.137 --> 23:27.240
What's wrong?

23:28.974 --> 23:32.495
Noah wants me to spend more
time there. In Trinidad.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.957
You should go.
I can handle this place.

23:34.982 --> 23:38.877
I'm talking a month, maybe
more. I can't do that to you.

23:40.023 --> 23:44.428
Maybe it will be better if you just...
come with me.

23:44.925 --> 23:46.510
To Trinidad?

23:46.535 --> 23:49.241
You'd love it there.
And I was thinking...

23:49.266 --> 23:50.899
if we sold this place,
we'd have enough money

23:50.924 --> 23:53.308
to go back and forth as much as we want.

23:54.010 --> 23:58.225
I know, I know. It's a lot to take in.
And I...

23:58.437 --> 24:00.571
I've seen how much you love this place.

24:01.225 --> 24:05.778
Well, I also like okra
and macaroni pie.

24:07.343 --> 24:09.177
So you'll consider it?

24:09.202 --> 24:13.120
Sweetie, if it's important to
you, of course I'll consider it.

24:14.612 --> 24:16.914
(LAUGHTER)

24:19.242 --> 24:20.919
Boy meets girl,

24:20.944 --> 24:25.125
girl plots revenge, boy goes to prison.
It's textbook.

24:25.150 --> 24:28.086
Riley is anything but textbook.
He's always working an angle.

24:28.110 --> 24:30.470
I don't like the guy either, but

24:30.495 --> 24:33.306
why would he hire us if he
was planning a robbery?

24:33.688 --> 24:35.540
Maybe he thought it would
be a good cover story

24:35.565 --> 24:36.915
for the jury if he ever got caught.

24:36.940 --> 24:38.625
That's' a bit of a stretch.

24:39.090 --> 24:42.858
If that were true, why wouldn't he
jump at the chance to blame Lola?

24:43.317 --> 24:46.069
Maybe the guy really is trying
to turn his life around.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.237
A stubborn alpha male seeking

24:48.262 --> 24:50.866
a second act. Why am
I getting a déja vu?

24:50.891 --> 24:53.242
It's the ex-con in you, Everett.
You can relate.

24:53.267 --> 24:54.400
Okay! Fine.

24:54.425 --> 24:56.496
Let's assume he didn't break in.
Where does that leave us?

24:56.521 --> 24:58.680
With a client who says
he was framed,

24:58.729 --> 25:01.592
and a jilted ex-lover who
maintains her innocence.

25:01.617 --> 25:04.253
- Two suspects.
- And one of them's lying.

25:05.118 --> 25:07.674
It's Riley. He's the one
who's lying.

25:07.699 --> 25:09.469
So you were upset that
he broke up with you.

25:09.494 --> 25:10.766
That's what he told you?

25:10.791 --> 25:14.070
Lou Lou! Sorry!

25:14.095 --> 25:16.767
She's always getting into something.

25:18.023 --> 25:20.477
No, no. It was me that broke it off.

25:20.502 --> 25:22.740
- And you're not holding your grudge?
- No.

25:22.765 --> 25:24.691
Why should we believe you?
You've already lied to us once.

25:24.716 --> 25:27.107
There's a difference between
covering for a friend

25:27.132 --> 25:28.594
and planning some frame job.

25:28.619 --> 25:31.333
Riley said he got a FlashYak
message from you

25:31.358 --> 25:33.980
just before two PM. Do you mind
telling us where you were?

25:34.005 --> 25:35.018
Right next door,

25:35.043 --> 25:38.211
in Aiden's bar, with
earplugs, drinking Negronis.

25:38.236 --> 25:40.302
There are six witnesses
who can confirm that.

25:40.327 --> 25:42.912
- And my cell never left my purse.
- Riley also said

25:42.937 --> 25:45.804
- the back door was unlocked.
- Like I said, he's a liar.

25:45.829 --> 25:48.005
I checked that door three
times before I left,

25:48.030 --> 25:50.349
that's how worried I was
about these bikers.

25:50.374 --> 25:52.344
- What time was that?
- 9 AM.

25:52.369 --> 25:56.083
I came to put the notice in the door
about shutting down for the day.

25:56.108 --> 25:58.005
And there was no sign
of a break-in.

25:58.030 --> 26:00.389
No. I polished the display cases,

26:00.414 --> 26:01.982
checked all the
windows and the doors.

26:02.007 --> 26:05.060
Then I turned on the alarm, locked
the door, and went to the pub.

26:05.085 --> 26:06.544
Why would Riley try to rob you?

26:06.569 --> 26:08.881
- Maybe he needed the money.
- I doubt that.

26:08.906 --> 26:11.612
He left a high-paying job
to follow his dream.

26:11.637 --> 26:13.975
He loves to spin it that way,
doesn't he?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.130
- What's your theory?
- You want to know the truth

26:16.155 --> 26:19.787
about why Riley quit law? Ask
him about his last client.

26:21.263 --> 26:24.176
Riley's last client
was Kirby Dunham,

26:24.201 --> 26:25.627
charged with first degree murder

26:25.652 --> 26:28.630
for pushing his wife off
a penthouse balcony.

26:28.821 --> 26:31.220
Dunham claimed she fell,
but Riley didn't present

26:31.245 --> 26:34.149
a very good case. Some even
say he tanked it on purpose.

26:34.174 --> 26:36.074
- Why would he do that?
- Not sure.

26:36.099 --> 26:39.693
But I did find a chatroom
rumour that says Riley found

26:39.718 --> 26:43.646
some old assault charges against
Kirby and slipped them to the judge.

26:43.671 --> 26:46.806
Ouch. That would sour
attorney-client relations.

26:46.831 --> 26:48.482
Maybe Kirby wanted Riley

26:48.507 --> 26:50.776
to feel what it's like
to be wrongly accused.

26:50.801 --> 26:53.654
But Kirby had an alibi.

26:54.312 --> 26:56.407
It's hard to do a frame-job from jail.

26:56.432 --> 27:01.829
- So we're nowhere.
- Not quite. I also found this.

27:02.523 --> 27:06.441
"The trial was interrupted
by Mr. Dunham's brother, Zane,

27:06.466 --> 27:09.990
so incensed by the verdict that he
threatened Mr. Dunham's lawyer."

27:10.015 --> 27:13.133
Maybe this Zane guy wants
to avenge his brother?

27:13.788 --> 27:15.988
Only one way to find out.

27:22.607 --> 27:24.557
So how are we gonna play this?

27:24.582 --> 27:27.051
We're just gonna shake his
tree and see what falls out.

27:27.076 --> 27:29.524
I love it when you talk P.I.

27:31.304 --> 27:33.862
Skull door knocker. Nice touch.

27:38.965 --> 27:43.162
- Tiny?
- Or should we say Zane Dunham?

27:48.519 --> 27:51.293
I was furious when my brother
got convicted.

27:51.318 --> 27:53.130
I stopped thinking straight.

27:53.697 --> 27:57.003
There's a rumour that Riley tanked
your brother's case on purpose.

27:57.028 --> 28:00.011
If that was my flesh and
blood, I'd be out for revenge.

28:00.036 --> 28:04.026
Wait, you think I framed Riley
for robbery? No.

28:04.051 --> 28:06.214
Mind telling us where you
were during the rally?

28:06.239 --> 28:08.701
On my bike riding the
circuit with everyone else.

28:08.726 --> 28:12.604
Still, I think Riley would be
interested to know who you really are.

28:12.818 --> 28:15.565
He knows. I told him.

28:16.138 --> 28:17.574
Look. I admit, I paid him

28:17.599 --> 28:19.878
a visit when the verdict came down.

28:19.903 --> 28:23.912
And things could have gone a
certain way. But they didn't.

28:24.812 --> 28:27.165
Not after he showed me the
evidence against Kirby.

28:27.190 --> 28:28.832
What evidence?

28:30.186 --> 28:33.505
I believed Kirby told me
Emma's death was an accident,

28:34.216 --> 28:37.758
just like I believed him when he
told me he never laid a hand on her.

28:38.731 --> 28:41.355
Then Riley showed me the pictures.

28:42.311 --> 28:44.879
Bruises all over her body.

28:44.904 --> 28:47.101
All these years and I didn't know.

28:48.127 --> 28:51.605
I knew then Kirby really did
push her off that balcony.

28:52.284 --> 28:54.266
What happened after that?

28:54.291 --> 28:56.261
Riley and I started to talk.

28:56.286 --> 28:58.347
He told me about the guilt,

28:58.372 --> 29:01.949
how all those years of helping
abusive men took its toll.

29:03.370 --> 29:06.222
Then he told me his idea
for the motorcycle rally

29:06.247 --> 29:08.114
to raise money for the women's shelter.

29:08.139 --> 29:10.373
He said it was just a PR move.

29:10.398 --> 29:14.675
Of course he'd say that.
He's a guy. We burry our guilt.

29:15.189 --> 29:17.924
WE GOTTA ASK: Where were you
Saturday morning?

29:17.949 --> 29:20.593
In Montreal, with my nephew.

29:20.618 --> 29:22.929
We made it back in time
for the town hall.

29:23.098 --> 29:25.165
I can show you the train ticket.

29:26.192 --> 29:28.310
I didn't do this, okay?

29:28.335 --> 29:32.271
But I know one thing for
sure: neither did Riley.

29:43.258 --> 29:45.392
(KEYS JINGLING)

29:45.417 --> 29:48.205
- Hey, Matt!
- Hey, dad!

29:48.914 --> 29:50.969
Woah! Tough day, uh?

29:50.994 --> 29:53.168
You don't wanna know.

29:53.633 --> 29:56.067
Nothing a little borscht
couldn't cure.

29:57.155 --> 29:59.734
- Borscht?
- Yeah!

29:59.900 --> 30:03.011
I used to make this for your mother
when she was pregnant with you.

30:03.355 --> 30:05.679
She ate it by the bucketful.

30:05.704 --> 30:08.307
There you go. Try that.

30:12.469 --> 30:15.372
Wow! It's actually really good!

30:15.397 --> 30:19.068
- You should put this on the menu.
- Yeah, about that.

30:20.084 --> 30:21.682
What would you say if I told you

30:21.707 --> 30:24.281
that we were thinking
of selling the diner?

30:24.471 --> 30:26.242
I thought you loved that place.

30:26.267 --> 30:30.246
I do, but Shona needs
to be with her family.

30:30.394 --> 30:34.500
I can buy cheap in Trinidad
and take up surfing!

30:34.525 --> 30:36.086
- Surfing?
- Yeah!

30:36.111 --> 30:38.735
You barely know how to couch
surf! And what about Jules?

30:38.760 --> 30:40.593
She'll be back from Europe next week.

30:40.618 --> 30:42.711
I can fly back and forth.
And she's gonna be

30:42.736 --> 30:47.057
in university soon, you're not
gonna need me around here forever.

30:47.082 --> 30:49.055
Are you sure about this, dad?

30:49.080 --> 30:50.554
The Red Bird has never been so busy

30:50.579 --> 30:52.570
And I've never seen you so happy.

30:52.595 --> 30:55.437
Yeah, well, I am enjoying it.

30:56.558 --> 30:58.776
But Shona needs her family.

30:59.304 --> 31:01.473
She's not the only one.

31:03.395 --> 31:06.116
It's hard to get a good
borscht hookup in the city.

31:08.395 --> 31:10.452
Yeah.

31:11.689 --> 31:14.195
- Trinidad?
- It threw me for a loop.

31:14.220 --> 31:15.667
I didn't think he'd move so quickly.

31:15.692 --> 31:18.529
I'm with you there.
But, like my Dad used to say:

31:18.554 --> 31:20.348
"Life is about finding your place."

31:20.373 --> 31:23.007
I just always assumed dad's
place was with his family.

31:23.032 --> 31:25.050
Talk about a 180.

31:26.209 --> 31:29.230
- What?
- Speaking of 180s,

31:29.255 --> 31:31.418
we were wondering why
Riley suddenly quit law.

31:31.443 --> 31:33.643
We know why. Kirby Dunham.

31:33.992 --> 31:35.794
But doesn't it seem odd
that he would re-invent

31:35.819 --> 31:38.051
himself over one case?

31:38.605 --> 31:41.316
- Thanks for posting bail.
- Don't worry. We'll add it

31:41.341 --> 31:43.442
- to the bill.
- What's going on?

31:43.467 --> 31:46.637
- You got something on the case?
- Uh, yes and no.

31:46.662 --> 31:50.130
We were wondering why you really
sabotaged the Kirby Dunham case.

31:50.155 --> 31:52.619
You defended him before,
didn't you?

31:53.823 --> 31:55.543
I tried to get past it,

31:55.568 --> 31:57.452
you know, continue my job,

31:57.477 --> 31:59.343
but I got him acquitted.

32:00.048 --> 32:01.519
Me.

32:01.544 --> 32:04.173
I'm the reason he was still
around to kill his wife.

32:04.690 --> 32:07.177
So, when he hired me the
second time around...

32:07.202 --> 32:08.528
You tanked the case.

32:08.553 --> 32:10.997
I quit my job, burned my
suit, and never looked back.

32:11.022 --> 32:13.141
So the women's shelter thing...

32:13.463 --> 32:15.340
it's not about "ticking
the right boxes."

32:16.174 --> 32:18.342
It's about redemption.

32:19.629 --> 32:21.396
I guess it didn't work.

32:21.541 --> 32:24.075
(MATT SIGHING)

32:24.547 --> 32:27.989
Look, we know
you didn't do this, but...

32:28.400 --> 32:30.243
we need something to go on.

32:32.754 --> 32:35.332
Apparently, they're still
missing a diamond brooch.

32:35.357 --> 32:38.040
They've searched Lola's place
three times. I mean...

32:38.065 --> 32:39.762
They think
you stashed it somewhere.

32:39.787 --> 32:42.129
10 bucks says
it's still in that satchel.

32:42.154 --> 32:44.935
So, we got our hands
on Lola's insurance claim.

32:44.960 --> 32:47.090
5K for the glass display
case, which checks out,

32:47.115 --> 32:49.098
but there is the matter of the
missing piece of jewelry.

32:49.123 --> 32:51.054
The brooch, we heard. How much?

32:51.079 --> 32:54.547
Appraised value: 95K.
And before you say anything,

32:54.572 --> 32:56.139
it's not in the satchel.
My boys searched it

32:56.164 --> 32:58.064
with a fine-tooth comb.
It is not in there.

32:58.089 --> 33:00.890
- You mean this satchel?
- OK. Can you not, Shade?

33:00.915 --> 33:02.575
How many times I gotta tell you
not to touch the evidence?

33:02.600 --> 33:05.235
Give me the bag! - Whoa...

33:05.547 --> 33:09.286
- What does that look like?
- Looks like we just found our lead.

33:13.106 --> 33:15.161
Perfect match.

33:15.686 --> 33:18.288
So, you're saying
the person who stole my satchel

33:18.313 --> 33:20.403
also tagged my wall? Why?

33:20.428 --> 33:22.228
To disguise their true intentions.

33:22.253 --> 33:23.973
- What do you mean?
- We've been looking at this

33:23.998 --> 33:27.674
all backwards. That morning you
came in here, you heard a noise

33:27.699 --> 33:30.215
coming from your workbench.
You went over to investigate,

33:30.240 --> 33:31.833
- you got knocked out.
- Right. So?

33:31.858 --> 33:34.809
So you didn't see the graffiti.
It would've been behind you.

33:34.834 --> 33:36.028
So, you're saying it wasn't there.

33:36.053 --> 33:38.629
Not yet. The suspect added it
after the fact.

33:38.654 --> 33:40.435
Whoever broke in here
broke in here

33:40.460 --> 33:43.004
for another reason: to
steal your satchel.

33:43.029 --> 33:45.857
But when you caught them, they
panicked and had to improvise.

33:45.882 --> 33:47.920
Let me guess: there was a can

33:47.945 --> 33:50.778
of that colour green spray paint
somewhere in the workshop?

33:50.803 --> 33:54.242
You know what, I...
Yeah, I was doing a touch-up job

33:54.267 --> 33:55.978
here last week. It was
right there on the shelf.

33:56.003 --> 33:58.413
After you were knocked out,
the suspect used the bad blood

33:58.438 --> 34:00.832
between you and the community
to cover their tracks.

34:00.857 --> 34:02.792
So, this was never
about the rally.

34:03.590 --> 34:05.689
This was all about framing me.

34:05.714 --> 34:07.755
Which means if we find the vandal,

34:07.780 --> 34:09.424
we find the real jewel thief.
