(chuckles)

00:34.601 --> 00:35.901
See you tomorrow, Rallo.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.904
Looking good, Rallo.

00:38.906 --> 00:40.305
Nice ass!

00:40.307 --> 00:41.874
So, Rallo, who you gonna be

00:41.876 --> 00:44.476
rubbing up on
at the school carnival?

00:44.478 --> 00:45.577
Fool, please.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.613
I'm too cool for pre-school.

00:47.615 --> 00:48.514
I need a real woman.

00:48.516 --> 00:51.817
There ain't a girl in our class
with more than an A-cup.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.153
Heck, there ain't
a girl in our class

00:54.155 --> 00:55.854
with more than a sippy cup.

00:55.856 --> 00:58.157
(laughter)

00:58.159 --> 00:59.291
What are you doing?

00:59.293 --> 01:01.894
I was practicing what
I'd do if I was on fire.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.495
- A'ight.
- (sighs)

01:03.497 --> 01:06.665
Rallo, I was robbed
today at school.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.934
A girl stole my heart.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.602
Her name is Chanel.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.804
Did you make your move?

01:11.806 --> 01:13.439
She's out of my league.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.540
So instead of making a move,

01:14.542 --> 01:17.576
I'm going to stuff my feelings
down deep so they can come out

01:17.578 --> 01:21.847
in interesting and
surprising ways years later.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.916
Hey, Too-cool-for-preschool,

01:23.918 --> 01:25.884
how 'bout getting him
hooked up with that girl

01:25.886 --> 01:27.920
he's all loco
in the coco about?

01:27.922 --> 01:28.921
Bring it on.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.522
How hot can
she be anyway?

01:30.524 --> 01:32.991
Probably somewhere between
a young Bea Arthur

01:32.993 --> 01:34.927
and a present-day
Bea Arthur.

01:34.929 --> 01:38.797
BEA ARTHUR:
<i>God will get you</i>
<i>for that, Rallo.</i>

01:38.799 --> 01:40.766
(audience laughter)

01:40.768 --> 01:41.934
(applause)

01:41.936 --> 01:44.570
(sitcom theme song playing)

01:50.076 --> 01:51.410
You're late!

01:51.412 --> 01:53.579
We're the cable guys;
we're always late.

01:53.581 --> 01:54.346
(laughs)

01:54.348 --> 01:57.049
That's not true.
We try.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.485
Hey, everyone!

01:59.487 --> 02:01.253
The cable guys are here!

02:01.255 --> 02:03.021
(hooting and hollering)

02:03.023 --> 02:04.857
Take it off!

02:04.859 --> 02:06.191
Come again?
Come on!

02:06.193 --> 02:07.159
(upbeat techno music playing)

02:07.161 --> 02:10.295
WOMAN:
Ooh, I love your hair!

02:10.297 --> 02:12.164
Man, they think
we're strippers.

02:12.166 --> 02:15.134
Good thing I'm wearing
my breakaway pants!

02:19.506 --> 02:20.439
(screams)

02:20.441 --> 02:24.409
That shirt is the property
of Waterman Cable!

02:24.411 --> 02:25.644
Come on man, loosen up!

02:25.646 --> 02:27.913
(women hooting and whooping)

02:30.316 --> 02:32.784
Let me see what
you're working with!

02:32.786 --> 02:33.919
Let me see your ass!

02:33.921 --> 02:35.687
I guess there's no harm

02:35.689 --> 02:37.990
in showing a little helmet.

02:37.992 --> 02:38.991
Here it is!

02:38.993 --> 02:40.993
Look, it's the Redskins!

02:40.995 --> 02:41.760
(laughs)

02:41.762 --> 02:43.362
Take your pants off!

02:43.364 --> 02:45.264
Oh...
(nervous chuckle)

02:45.266 --> 02:47.766
(making siren noises)

02:51.504 --> 02:53.605
(women whooping, cheering)

02:55.708 --> 02:58.243
$435!

02:58.245 --> 03:00.746
Terry, do you realize
if we did

03:00.748 --> 03:02.648
four bachelorette
parties a day,

03:02.650 --> 03:07.452
we'd be clearing more
than $450,000 a year?!

03:07.454 --> 03:10.022
And if we spend it all
at Bed, Bath & Beyond,

03:10.024 --> 03:12.724
saving 20% from the gross,

03:12.726 --> 03:17.062
that's, like, $562,500!

03:17.064 --> 03:18.864
Sheets! Candles!

03:18.866 --> 03:20.933
Bath mats! Small appliances!

03:20.935 --> 03:22.768
We'll be swimming in them!

03:22.770 --> 03:25.804
Oh, Terry, we have got
to make this happen!

03:25.806 --> 03:27.873
A couple of those chicks
did ask for our number.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.442
As long as your wife
is cool with it.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.276
Donna!

03:31.278 --> 03:32.044
You're right.

03:32.046 --> 03:35.881
This is exactly the sort
of thing wives don't like.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.783
Wait, I'll make up a lie.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.619
But what if she
finds out I'm lying?

03:40.621 --> 03:43.655
I'll just tell her
I wasn't lying.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.424
(laughs)

03:47.060 --> 03:50.529
Today is your lucky day,
Cleveland Jr.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.730
Yay! Why?

03:51.732 --> 03:54.566
I've decided to help you
on your quest for love.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.035
So I'm gonna give you
some of Rallo's Rules.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.870
First, you got to stand out.

03:58.872 --> 04:02.074
Decorate your body
to attract a mate.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.675
Here.

04:05.945 --> 04:06.645
Wow!

04:06.647 --> 04:07.879
It only hurt for a second!

04:07.881 --> 04:11.950
Second, find a way
to initiate physical contact.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.353
Here's one of my classics.

04:14.355 --> 04:14.886
Hey, little lady.

04:14.888 --> 04:18.023
What if I told you
that you could draw a turkey

04:18.025 --> 04:19.992
using nothing but your hand?

04:21.628 --> 04:24.563
(Cleveland Jr. giggles)

04:24.565 --> 04:28.133
I've never been
turkey-fingered before.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.735
Third, smile.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.037
Think of something
that makes you happy.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.138
What are you
thinking about?

04:33.140 --> 04:35.507
Anderson Cooper
with curly hair.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.475
(giggles)

04:36.477 --> 04:39.444
All right, don't say out loud
what you're thinking.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.847
♪ As I walked out

04:41.849 --> 04:44.116
♪ On the streets of Lare--

04:44.118 --> 04:46.618
Oh, hey,
there's our cable truck.

04:49.522 --> 04:50.656
(dance music playing inside)

04:50.658 --> 04:52.524
All right! My jam!

04:53.993 --> 04:56.495
(women cheering)

05:00.400 --> 05:01.133
Terry!

05:01.135 --> 05:03.068
You really are a stripper.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.871
A stripper
of a friend's trust.

05:05.873 --> 05:06.905
(groans)

05:06.907 --> 05:09.074
(school bell rings)

05:09.076 --> 05:11.109
All right,
now put this in your ear,

05:11.111 --> 05:12.477
and I'm gonna feed you lines.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.946
Hasn't this bit
been done to death?

05:14.948 --> 05:16.114
Yeah, you're right.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.115
You got this.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.116
Go make me proud.

05:18.118 --> 05:21.053
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

05:21.055 --> 05:21.853
All right.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.889
Now show her the tattoo.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.124
(quiet chatter continues)

05:26.126 --> 05:27.392
(laughs)

05:29.729 --> 05:30.629
Talk to me.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.596
She said yes!

05:31.598 --> 05:32.898
She's coming over
to the house

05:32.900 --> 05:34.733
to study geometry
with me tomorrow.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.001
Ha, ha!
There he goes!

05:36.003 --> 05:37.636
Look what
Big Round Brown did.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.104
Here she comes!

05:39.106 --> 05:41.406
♪

05:45.978 --> 05:48.680
See you tomorrow,
Cleveland Jr.

05:51.517 --> 05:55.053
She will be mine.

06:00.493 --> 06:03.528
O... bama!

06:13.973 --> 06:15.140
Hey, man,
what's going on?

06:15.142 --> 06:17.142
I'm confronting you.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.343
About betraying me.

06:18.345 --> 06:22.514
My friends think
I'm strong enough to do this.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.149
And I believe them.

06:24.151 --> 06:24.950
Ah, man.

06:24.952 --> 06:25.951
I'm sorry, Cleveland.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.152
I didn't want to
hurt your feelings,

06:27.154 --> 06:29.554
but the women who called
specifically requested

06:29.556 --> 06:31.189
that you not come.

06:31.191 --> 06:31.790
What?!

06:31.792 --> 06:33.091
You must have
misinterpreted them.

06:33.093 --> 06:36.228
They said, "Please do not bring
the portly black gentleman."

06:36.230 --> 06:39.898
One woman was particularly
repulsed by your stretch marks.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.533
I have a child!

06:41.535 --> 06:42.701
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

06:42.703 --> 06:45.036
Cleveland, you can
be my manager!

06:45.038 --> 06:46.705
Book gigs,
handle the money.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.106
I mean, you're
decent with numbers,

06:48.108 --> 06:50.008
and-and I don't know
any Jewish people.

06:50.010 --> 06:54.045
Tell you what, I get 20%,
and it's a deal.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.647
Hell, you can
have 30%!

06:55.649 --> 06:59.751
Wow, you really don't know
any Jewish people, do you?

07:01.788 --> 07:03.722
Oh, this is so hard.

07:03.724 --> 07:07.025
I don't know how to find
the secant of a triangle.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.628
Well, then hold on a secant.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.297
(long, nervous laugh)

07:12.299 --> 07:15.200
(identical long,
nervous giggle)

07:15.202 --> 07:16.034
(both laughing)

07:16.036 --> 07:17.736
Hey, is that
Chanel Williams

07:17.738 --> 07:19.771
chopping it up with
my steppity-bro?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.807
I think you mean
step-brizzle.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.241
(awkward laugh)

07:23.243 --> 07:24.209
(awkward laugh)

07:24.211 --> 07:26.478
(awkward laughter)

07:26.480 --> 07:29.314
(all laughing goofily)

07:29.316 --> 07:31.850
There's been a gas leak!

07:35.455 --> 07:37.889
(laughing continues)

07:38.858 --> 07:40.659
Leave the batteries

07:40.661 --> 07:43.728
in your carbon monoxide
detector from now on.

07:43.730 --> 07:47.098
When your wife says she'll
use it in front of you,

07:47.100 --> 07:49.067
you find some
batteries.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.703
(both share a knowing chuckle)

07:51.705 --> 07:52.771
Yo, check it.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.807
Big Fed's about to bless
y'all with two VIP passes

07:55.809 --> 07:59.578
to the release party for
my new CD, <i>Fireman Killer.</i>

07:59.580 --> 08:01.746
But aren't firemen heroes?

08:01.748 --> 08:02.747
(scoffs)
To who?

08:02.749 --> 08:05.217
Wastin' water,
blastin' they sirens,

08:05.219 --> 08:08.753
ridin' around with them
Dalmatian-ass dogs.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.188
Blap!

08:10.890 --> 08:12.491
Was he that dumb
before the gas leak?

08:12.493 --> 08:16.561
He's just trying to find
his way like everybody else.

08:16.563 --> 08:17.596
You're sweet.

08:17.598 --> 08:20.298
RALLO:
Well, what do we have here?

08:20.300 --> 08:22.968
(mellow rock)

08:22.970 --> 08:24.603
I didn't know we had a guest,

08:24.605 --> 08:27.038
much less such
a beautiful young lady.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.307
What are you guys
working on, math?

08:29.309 --> 08:30.175
Oh, a number six.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.776
Yeah, I know how
to make one of those.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.980
In fact, Chanel,
I even know how to draw a turkey

08:34.982 --> 08:37.649
using nothing
but your lovely hand.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.718
We could do it in my room.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.119
You are just too cute!

08:41.121 --> 08:41.987
Huh?

08:41.989 --> 08:45.624
(baby talk): Does somebody
want a airplane ride?

08:45.626 --> 08:46.758
Whoosh! Whoosh!

08:46.760 --> 08:48.093
Put me down!
Put me down!

08:48.095 --> 08:49.761
Whoosh! Whee!
Put me...

08:49.763 --> 08:50.729
Here we go!
Whee!

08:50.731 --> 08:51.997
(laughs):
Oh, I'm a plane!

08:51.999 --> 08:54.366
You are!
Yes, you are!
Wait a minute, put me down.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.300
(grunts)

08:55.302 --> 08:56.701
Sorry he's so cranky.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.004
He was up till 7:15 last night.

08:59.006 --> 08:59.938
Oh, thanks.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.373
Anybody else
want to take a shot?

09:01.375 --> 09:03.708
Rallo, are you
bothering the big kids?

09:03.710 --> 09:06.711
Come here, I need to give
you your diarrhea medicine.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.879
(both laugh)

09:07.881 --> 09:11.816
You are in for a world of hurt,
buffalo butt.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.084
What did you call me?!

09:13.086 --> 09:16.555
No, not you, Mom-- (screams)

09:20.726 --> 09:23.828
Hey, Junior, glad to hear
that first date went well.

09:23.830 --> 09:28.033
Now I want to give you
Rallo's Rules for a second date.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.200
(evil chuckle)

09:29.202 --> 09:31.803
(echoing evil chuckle
innocently)

09:31.805 --> 09:32.737
Thanks!

09:32.739 --> 09:33.705
Okay, listen up.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.140
Always be on your phone.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.708
It makes you
look important.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.276
Talking, texting,
doesn't matter.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.780
But what if she has something
she wants to talk to me about?

09:41.782 --> 09:44.049
Then you let out
a long exhale,

09:44.051 --> 09:46.818
roll your eyes and say,
"What?"

09:46.820 --> 09:50.088
And if there's a problem,
you try to solve it immediately.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.990
Don't even wait to hear
the whole problem.

09:51.992 --> 09:55.393
And then look back at
your phone, point to it and say,

09:55.395 --> 09:57.829
"Ha, ha,
this guy's hilarious."

09:57.831 --> 10:00.031
Be on your phone,
never listen,

10:00.033 --> 10:02.233
"this guy's
hilarious."

10:02.235 --> 10:03.335
Thanks, Rallo!

10:03.337 --> 10:04.469
You're welcome.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.404
(sinister laugh)

10:06.406 --> 10:09.441
DONNA (in distance):
Rallo, it's time
to take a pee-pee!

10:09.443 --> 10:13.812
I wish so much I didn't have
to take a pee-pee right now.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.648
(grumbling)

10:18.084 --> 10:19.951
Come on out of there.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.454
Come on out of there,
lost hair.

10:22.456 --> 10:25.724
I'm gonna scratch
a little hole in the skin

10:25.726 --> 10:27.726
so you can find your way out.

10:27.728 --> 10:31.129
Stretch on out instead
of being all curled and bunched.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.864
Hey, what took
you so long?

10:32.866 --> 10:35.100
We're going to be late
for your next gig.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.202
Hey, there's
$200 here.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.269
Big tippers, huh?

10:38.271 --> 10:38.903
Nah, no tips.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.872
Just, you know,
a hundred for the stripping

10:40.874 --> 10:42.340
and a hundred for the sex.

10:42.342 --> 10:42.907
What now?

10:42.909 --> 10:44.576
It turns out
that they kind of expect

10:44.578 --> 10:48.213
the "deluxe package,"
if you know what I mean.

10:48.215 --> 10:48.913
Wait.

10:48.915 --> 10:51.850
I'm organizing
and scheduling sexual acts

10:51.852 --> 10:55.020
and then collecting
a portion of the profits?

10:55.022 --> 10:56.721
Yep.
Terry,

10:56.723 --> 10:59.491
that makes you a prostitute!

10:59.493 --> 11:03.161
And that makes me... a pimp!

11:03.163 --> 11:03.895
(giggles)

11:03.897 --> 11:05.096
I'm a pimp!

11:05.098 --> 11:08.433
Oh, I'm gonna go buy a
pimp hat and a pimp suit,

11:08.435 --> 11:10.502
some pimp shoes,
maybe a pimp scarf...

11:10.504 --> 11:11.503
Pimp socks?

11:11.505 --> 11:14.706
No one's gonna see
my damn socks, you slut.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.074
(both laughing)

11:16.076 --> 11:17.942
Hey, you're not
paid to laugh.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.378
Get out there and
make my money, trick!

11:20.380 --> 11:22.147
Okay, that one hurt a little.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.115
I'm sorry,
I'm just so excited

11:24.117 --> 11:26.284
to be a (high-pitched): pimp!

11:27.853 --> 11:28.553
(chuckles)

11:28.555 --> 11:30.822
This is gonna
be good, fellas.

11:30.824 --> 11:31.890
One sec, Chanel.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.492
I'm just reading
a text from my dad.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.027
This guy's hilarious.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.063
(chuckles)
Here we go. Here we go.

11:38.065 --> 11:42.133
I'm gonna write him back because
I'm very important to him.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.601
No, but I love my dad.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.236
Aw, that's cute.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.372
I didn't tell him
to say that.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.373
(giggling)

11:48.375 --> 11:49.541
KENNY:
Chanel?

11:49.543 --> 11:50.975
Kenny?

11:58.417 --> 12:00.385
That's Kenny West.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.186
Who's that?

12:01.188 --> 12:03.421
Stoolbend's most
famous rapper.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.824
You'd know that
if you read my blog,

12:05.826 --> 12:08.059
"Out and About
with Julius."

12:08.061 --> 12:08.860
Who are you?

12:08.862 --> 12:09.994
Her boyfriend.

12:09.996 --> 12:12.630
You'd know that if you read
"Out and About with Julius."

12:12.632 --> 12:14.132
Not exactly.
We broke up.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.134
I gotta get to a phone!

12:16.136 --> 12:19.471
Chanel, what are you doing
with this water balloon?

12:19.473 --> 12:21.106
This is Cleveland Jr.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.108
He's sweet and thoughtful,

12:23.110 --> 12:26.111
and he doesn't make me wait
around all day while he's off

12:26.113 --> 12:28.079
buying sunglasses
with his posse.

12:28.081 --> 12:28.980
Cleveland Jr.?

12:28.982 --> 12:31.449
There ain't nothing
junior about this guy.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.084
(laughing)

12:33.919 --> 12:34.786
(laughing)

12:34.788 --> 12:35.987
Crash and burn, Junior.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.356
This worked out even better
than I planned.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.125
Who is this
Chia dwarf?

12:40.127 --> 12:41.059
What'd you just call me?

12:41.061 --> 12:43.962
You get that tattoo
from a Cracker Jack box?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.029
Yeah. Why?

12:45.031 --> 12:46.264
(laughing)

12:46.266 --> 12:47.265
Tell me, little man.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.934
How the hell do you support
that big-ass afro

12:49.936 --> 12:51.269
with that tiny-ass neck?

12:51.271 --> 12:54.172
You're like
a Questlove
bobblehead.

12:54.174 --> 12:57.041
Come on, Chanel.
We need to talk.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.910
Sorry, Junior.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.445
Chanel, wait!

13:01.080 --> 13:02.647
Sometimes I even kiss

13:02.649 --> 13:04.382
my dad on the lips!

13:04.384 --> 13:07.886
(laughing)

13:13.392 --> 13:16.961
Man, Kenny West made us
both look like punks.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.031
Oh, well. I guess we need
to pray for the courage

13:20.033 --> 13:22.500
to accept the things
we cannot change.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.835
Man, shut up!

13:23.837 --> 13:25.069
We gotta get revenge.

13:25.071 --> 13:27.305
And we are gonna
get you that girl back

13:27.307 --> 13:29.908
at Federline's party tonight.

13:29.910 --> 13:34.379
Yaaaaayyyyy...!

13:34.381 --> 13:36.681
I'm just gonna...

13:36.683 --> 13:40.819
...aaaaayyyy!

13:42.388 --> 13:45.123
(whistling tune)

13:47.059 --> 13:49.561
Cleveland, where did you
get that huge wad of cash?

13:49.563 --> 13:53.064
Can't a man sneak into his house
in the middle of the night

13:53.066 --> 13:55.300
with a huge wad
of unexplained cash

13:55.302 --> 13:58.069
without being nagged
by his wife?

13:58.071 --> 13:58.603
Shoot.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.738
Well, Yvette told me
a friend of hers

14:00.740 --> 14:04.142
received one of Terry's
special installations.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.444
Also, I found this next
to the bathroom sink.

14:06.446 --> 14:10.381
Well, what are you doing looking
next to the bathroom sink?

14:10.383 --> 14:11.416
You're pimping Terry.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.084
Ain't nothin'
but somethin' to do.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.686
Cleveland, it's a crime!

14:14.688 --> 14:15.486
What?!

14:15.488 --> 14:17.322
Crimes have victims, Donna.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.690
There are no victims here.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.025
Prostitutes are
the victims.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.961
Terry is the victim.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.295
Ha! I'm Terry.

14:24.297 --> 14:27.465
"Oh, no, I have to have sex,
which feels really good.

14:27.467 --> 14:31.603
"Oh, it's worse, I have
to have sex for cash money

14:31.605 --> 14:33.271
"that I can buy things with.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.907
"Oh, and I can't stay
the night and hold in farts

14:35.909 --> 14:40.311
"while I listen to story after
story about your funny coworker.

14:40.313 --> 14:45.116
(crying):
Oh, oh, make it stop!"

14:45.118 --> 14:47.385
You're an idiot.

14:48.754 --> 14:51.222
Can you believe
she said that?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.757
You, a victim.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.726
(laughs)
As if.

14:54.728 --> 14:55.894
(laughs)

14:55.896 --> 14:56.728
I know, I know.

14:56.730 --> 15:00.398
Although sometimes I can't help
thinking that man wasn't meant

15:00.400 --> 15:03.301
to do it more than
six times a day.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.036
And now that you mention it,

15:05.038 --> 15:07.305
you know what else I found out
about myself?

15:07.307 --> 15:08.806
I don't like to be strangled.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.909
Hell, it's scary.

15:10.911 --> 15:11.676
You black out.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.478
You wake up
in a different place,

15:13.480 --> 15:15.680
your face
in a different headboard.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.382
(laughs, sighs)

15:17.384 --> 15:19.450
And that's just
the physical pain.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.586
I never thought
I'd hear myself say this:

15:21.588 --> 15:23.454
I don't want to be a prostitute.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.591
Well, at least I get
to hang on to these.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.127
Hey, you got the pimp socks!

15:29.129 --> 15:30.395
I did.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.530
Thanks for
the fun, Terry.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.465
You were my
best bitch.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.401
And you were
a cold, cold pimp.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.604
CLEVELAND:
<i>Sorry about all those men</i>
<i>I set you up with.</i>

15:39.606 --> 15:42.240
(lively music and chatter)

15:44.276 --> 15:46.811
Yo, what's poppin', y'all?

15:46.813 --> 15:48.279
I want to thank everyone
for coming

15:48.281 --> 15:51.416
to the official release party
of <i>Fireman Killer.</i>

15:51.418 --> 15:55.620
Firemen's been getting
a free pass for too long.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.422
(clapping)

15:57.424 --> 15:59.724
May-may we say a few words?

15:59.726 --> 16:00.725
Dag, Pops.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.427
Why you always gotta
blow up my spot?

16:02.429 --> 16:04.762
We're not blowing up
anyone's spot. (sighs)

16:04.764 --> 16:08.833
Hello, I'm Gabriel's father,
Professor Friedman.

16:08.835 --> 16:13.071
And I'm Gabriel's mother,
also Professor Friedman.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.472
(both laughing)

16:14.474 --> 16:17.175
Please be mindful
of the new carpet.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.143
Enjoy!

16:20.679 --> 16:22.547
She's here.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.116
All right, now get over there

16:25.118 --> 16:27.118
and tell her how you feel.

16:27.619 --> 16:30.121
Chanel, there's something
I want to tell you.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.089
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:31.091 --> 16:33.858
I can't believe you're showing
your face around here,

16:33.860 --> 16:35.760
especially talking
to my girl like that.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.295
I should mess you
up right now.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.732
But instead, I'm gonna
take you down with my lyrics.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.974
(cheering wildly)

19:02.976 --> 19:04.909
(punching)

19:09.882 --> 19:11.983
(panicked screaming)

19:11.985 --> 19:15.386
Saul, call the
fire department!

19:15.388 --> 19:16.621
(dialing)
No!

19:16.623 --> 19:17.688
Don't y'all see?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.924
That's just what
they want y'all to...

19:21.627 --> 19:23.294
(dialing)

19:23.296 --> 19:24.328
(groans)

19:24.330 --> 19:26.497
(siren wailing)

19:28.734 --> 19:33.471
Dag, girl, my whole
world is upside down.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.339
They <i>are</i> heroes.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.575
Not like those
Coast Guard punks,

19:37.577 --> 19:39.377
with they
tuggin'-ass boats.

19:39.379 --> 19:42.647
You got another
CD in you, boo.

19:43.815 --> 19:44.949
(chiming tones)

19:44.951 --> 19:46.551
(sizzling)

19:46.553 --> 19:47.985
What do you know?
It works.

19:47.987 --> 19:51.088
Hey, Junior. Man, I'm sorry
I laid into you so hard.

19:51.090 --> 19:54.392
It was just kind of tough
seeing you with my baby mama.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.394
Baby mama?

19:56.396 --> 19:57.028
Yes.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.596
Kenny and I have
a child together.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.364
Meet Kandace.

20:00.832 --> 20:04.402
(sputtering):
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wow!

20:04.404 --> 20:06.370
You two are a
mommy and daddy?

20:06.372 --> 20:09.240
Kenny, don't tell me
my new-friend-slash-hype-man

20:09.242 --> 20:10.041
is a deadbeat dad?

20:10.043 --> 20:11.409
Nah, I ain't
no deadbeat dad.

20:11.411 --> 20:15.079
I'm taking Kandace to school,
I'm putting her to bed at night,

20:15.081 --> 20:19.016
I'm running around town trying
to sell bone-density machines.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.451
Do you know how hard it is

20:20.453 --> 20:22.720
to sell a bone-density
machine in this economy?

20:22.722 --> 20:25.056
How hard is it?

20:25.058 --> 20:26.757
It's hard.

20:26.759 --> 20:27.491
Oh.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.460
I thought you were
trying to set up a joke.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.363
The point is,
this child needs a family.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.831
And this is a good man.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.367
And who knows-- someday
he might even make it

20:36.369 --> 20:39.036
as the self-described
voice of his generation.

20:39.038 --> 20:39.870
Thanks, man.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.973
Hey, I want you
to have something.

20:41.975 --> 20:45.543
Nah, they look good on you.

20:49.615 --> 20:52.850
What if I told you
that you could draw a turkey

20:52.852 --> 20:56.821
with nothing but your hand?
