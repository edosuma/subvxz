WEBVTT

00:08.200 --> 00:11.600
Jesus, I'm raising five kids,
and I didn't miss last week.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.367
What's your excuse?

00:13.367 --> 00:15.633
(sighs) Carl!

00:15.633 --> 00:17.133
I'm looking for Frank.

00:17.133 --> 00:18.600
FIONA: Two assholes busted
into our house

00:18.600 --> 00:20.133
looking for you and some car.

00:20.133 --> 00:21.367
I don't care how you get
the money,

00:21.367 --> 00:23.734
but I want six grand
in cash by Saturday,

00:23.734 --> 00:25.500
or this ear will be
hanging around my neck.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.300
The shoplifting is out of hand.

00:28.433 --> 00:30.300
IAN:
Did Mickey pay for that?

00:30.300 --> 00:32.033
That's it. Follow me.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.033
You know where I live,
if you have a problem.

00:36.033 --> 00:38.633
SHEILA: I have not been out of
the house in five years.

00:38.633 --> 00:42.166
Oh! I can't!
Stop it! Make it stop!

If you didn't run away,
we'd have flushed first.

02:04.233 --> 02:05.600
We want our six grand.

02:07.233 --> 02:10.467
(Frank gasping)

02:10.467 --> 02:12.367
Anything?

02:12.367 --> 02:14.567
Flyer for guitar lessons
and a comb.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.633
What do I owe you
for the reach-around?

02:16.633 --> 02:18.567
(garbled yelling)

02:18.567 --> 02:21.133
24 hours, Frank.

02:21.133 --> 02:23.200
Today is put-your-head-in-
the-toilet day.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.333
You know what that makes
tomorrow, Frank?

02:25.333 --> 02:27.100
Put-your-head-in-
the-trash-compactor day.

02:29.734 --> 02:32.266
I got semolina,

02:32.266 --> 02:33.467
seven-grain
and whole wheat!

02:33.467 --> 02:36.400
You work at a bakery
and all you stole was bread?

02:36.400 --> 02:37.600
Where're the crullers
and turnovers?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.066
We want sugar.

02:39.066 --> 02:41.400
Yeah? Too bad.
Free toast for a week.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.533
Who wants a sandwich?

02:42.533 --> 02:44.367
Mine with the crusts cut off.

02:44.367 --> 02:45.667
How was your
wake-and-bake?

02:45.667 --> 02:48.266
2:00 a.m. start time.

02:48.266 --> 02:49.734
I don't know
how Lucia does it.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.667
Hey, I got
a surprise for you.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.166
Gotta do something
about that toilet.

02:53.166 --> 02:55.233
What's wrong with it?
Nothing, if you don't mind

02:55.233 --> 02:56.667
squatting above the seat like
a Laotian coolie

02:56.667 --> 02:58.233
so your ass doesn't touch
the water.

02:58.233 --> 02:59.500
Did you try and fix it?

02:59.500 --> 03:01.367
Hell, no.
I just got my nails done.

03:01.367 --> 03:03.433
I got us a room
at the Delacroix
tonight.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.266
Good for you.
Who you gonna take?

03:05.266 --> 03:06.700
Sounds nice.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.633
Where are the knives?

03:08.633 --> 03:10.066
Carl?!

03:10.066 --> 03:11.734
Gotta love
these half days.

03:11.734 --> 03:13.200
Good thing
public education is broke.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.133
Yeah, waste of time anyway.

03:14.133 --> 03:16.200
The only thing
those people are equipped

03:16.200 --> 03:18.433
to teach is how to live
with crippling disappointment.

03:18.433 --> 03:19.700
Hey, wanna catch
a movie later?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.066
Brandy can sneak us in.

03:21.066 --> 03:23.700
Can't. Gotta be
at work by 3:00.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.600
Nice jacket Kash
bought you, by the way.
Thanks.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.367
Yeah. Tell Kash
I'll take it in the ass

03:29.367 --> 03:31.133
if it gets me free stuff.

03:31.133 --> 03:33.266
Hey! Hey, yeah,
I'm talking to you.

03:33.266 --> 03:34.734
Yeah?
You got a phone?

03:34.734 --> 03:35.734
What? Your truck
break down?

03:35.734 --> 03:37.333
No, genius, I like
standing in

03:37.333 --> 03:38.467
the middle of a shitty
neighborhood

03:38.467 --> 03:39.600
with my dick in my hands.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.300
Look, I'm already
two hours late
on this load.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.400
I try to take one shortcut,
this is what I get.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.100
My goddamn kid drained my phone
playing Doodle Jump.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.767
My goddamn wife
took my charger.

03:48.767 --> 03:50.233
Listen, I'll give you

03:50.233 --> 03:52.000
five bucks, you let me use
your phone.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.533
Just-Just one call.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.133
Oh, we-we don't
have a phone.

03:55.133 --> 03:57.600
Our dad says not
till we're 18.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.367
Um, but you know what?

03:59.367 --> 04:03.333
There's a bar, I think,
about ten blocks that way.

04:03.333 --> 04:05.133
What's it called?
Uh... O'Flaherty's.
O'Flaherty's.

04:05.133 --> 04:07.200
Tell them your family's
from County Cork.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.600
Ten blocks?

04:08.600 --> 04:10.533
Maybe five.
Straight shot.

04:10.533 --> 04:12.567
Damn it.

04:12.567 --> 04:14.767
This is yours
if you keep

04:14.767 --> 04:16.500
an eye on the truck.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.633
Five bucks?!

04:17.633 --> 04:20.166
Oh, cool! Thanks, mister.

04:22.233 --> 04:25.033
Hey, hey, make sure
no one gets near it.

04:25.033 --> 04:27.100
Will do.

04:37.033 --> 04:39.033
Yeah, Kev,
43rd and Halsted.

04:39.033 --> 04:41.033
Bring the crowbar.

04:43.767 --> 04:46.166
So tonight,
what do you think?

04:46.166 --> 04:48.266
Like I'm going
to a hotel tonight.

04:48.266 --> 04:50.700
You know a great thing
about hotels is

04:50.700 --> 04:52.233
that the toilets actually work.

04:53.300 --> 04:55.600
You buy watches?

04:55.600 --> 04:56.667
Buy, trade.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.433
I need cash.

04:58.433 --> 05:01.333
"20 years with the ITC."

05:01.333 --> 05:03.667
Sure you want
to part with this, Eddie?

05:03.667 --> 05:05.333
That's 24-carat gold.

05:05.333 --> 05:06.700
Best there is.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.734
Test it. You'll see.

05:14.066 --> 05:16.367
Damn Palestinians, huh?

05:16.367 --> 05:18.500
It's like they come out
of the womb

05:18.500 --> 05:20.266
wearing a suicide vest,
am I right?

05:23.200 --> 05:25.200
You ask me,
we should just give you guys

05:25.200 --> 05:26.467
the green light,
take 'em all out.

05:26.467 --> 05:30.066
I believe in
a two-state solution.

05:30.066 --> 05:34.300
Don't know why
you Yids get such a bad rap

05:34.300 --> 05:37.100
for being greedy,
controlling the media,

05:37.100 --> 05:38.467
making everyone get
their dicks cut.

05:38.467 --> 05:39.400
Killing our Lord

05:39.400 --> 05:41.200
and Savior?
Everyone knows

05:41.200 --> 05:42.767
that was Pontius Pilate,
not you!

05:42.767 --> 05:45.667
$35.

05:45.667 --> 05:47.633
$250.
$35.

05:47.633 --> 05:50.033
The hell?

05:50.033 --> 05:52.233
You're supposed to negotiate!

05:52.233 --> 05:56.066
The phrase "Jew me down" only
works if you take the fair price

05:56.066 --> 05:58.033
I start with and you slowly
Jew me down

05:58.033 --> 06:00.133
to an unacceptable number.

06:00.133 --> 06:02.600
You can't bottom-line some
rip-off rate from the get-go.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.000
Now give me a number!

06:04.000 --> 06:08.066
$35. And my ancestors and I take
full credit

06:08.066 --> 06:10.367
for crucifying that Christ putz.

06:10.367 --> 06:13.233
So you want the
$35 or not?

06:17.066 --> 06:19.300
Mel Gibson was right!

06:27.266 --> 06:29.567
Don't touch my cup, Frank.

06:29.567 --> 06:32.400
I just came over
to say hello, Benny.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.600
Jesus!

06:33.600 --> 06:36.266
It's a neat trick, you
knowing it was me, though.

06:36.266 --> 06:38.700
Who else smell
like Old Style and ball sweat?

06:38.700 --> 06:40.266
(chuckles)

06:40.266 --> 06:42.100
I'll, uh, I'll help you
cross the street.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.667
I don't want
to cross no street.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.467
Jesus! I need it more
than you!

06:51.000 --> 06:52.033
DEBBIE:
Wow!

06:52.033 --> 06:53.667
(laughing)
Fuck!

06:57.400 --> 06:59.033
(all clamoring, laughing)

07:01.066 --> 07:03.166
You go ahead.
I'm gonna go back

07:03.166 --> 07:04.667
and fight my way
for more.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.700
Are you sure that's
such a good idea?

07:08.433 --> 07:11.667
Out of my way!
I've buried two husbands!

07:11.667 --> 07:13.166
Take it easy, Grandma.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.300
How the hell we gonna fit
all of that in there?

07:16.300 --> 07:18.266
We can hang it in
the garage till spring,

07:18.266 --> 07:19.767
hack off what we need.

07:19.767 --> 07:21.000
Rats would get it.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.467
Rats won't be a problem.

07:22.467 --> 07:23.567
Move, move, move!

07:23.567 --> 07:27.367
Move, move, move, move, move!
Here we go! (grunts)

07:27.367 --> 07:29.066
Does Ron Fitzgerald still have
that chainsaw?

07:29.066 --> 07:32.200
Yeah, he owes me
'cause I told his wife
he was on his way home

07:32.200 --> 07:34.500
when he was actually getting
a hummer from some dude.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.433
Lip? Lip,
let's go.
Yeah.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.266
Straight shot?

07:40.266 --> 07:42.633
There's no O'Flaherty's,
there's no stinking way

07:42.633 --> 07:44.734
they're gettin'
that five bucks now.

07:53.400 --> 07:57.667
Hey, look what fell off
the back of a truck.

07:59.066 --> 08:01.467
Mickey? Again?

08:01.467 --> 08:04.066
I don't think he detached
my retina this time.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.233
Linda's gonna shit a brick.

08:05.233 --> 08:06.533
Let me see.

08:06.533 --> 08:09.033
Look, I can run out and
replace whatever he took

08:09.033 --> 08:10.500
before she gets here,
all right?

08:10.500 --> 08:11.667
No, you can't.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.600
It's gonna take three days
for the background check.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.533
He took the gun?
How?

08:15.533 --> 08:17.333
I pulled it on him.
Even released the safety.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.300
But what was
I supposed to do?

08:19.300 --> 08:20.300
Shoot him
over a cup-a-soup?

08:20.300 --> 08:22.367
I wish he'd burnt
the store down.

08:22.367 --> 08:23.533
I never wanted it
to begin with.

08:23.533 --> 08:25.667
Wanted to be a landscaper.

08:25.667 --> 08:28.100
Where's the charcoal?

08:28.100 --> 08:29.233
Above the veggies.

08:29.233 --> 08:31.100
Barbecue sauce?

08:36.633 --> 08:38.033
Got more newspapers.

08:38.033 --> 08:40.133
Oh, I think this cheese expired
when Bush was president.

08:40.133 --> 08:41.600
It's supposed to age.
It's fine.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.300
(chainsaw revving)
Wait. Who's got
the chainsaw?

08:43.300 --> 08:45.400
Lip.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.500
You know, another cool
thing about hotels is that

08:47.500 --> 08:49.333
you don't have
to saw your own meat.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.567
Any more
gallon-sized Ziplocks?

08:50.567 --> 08:52.667
You look exhausted.
You could use the getaway.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.567
Fuck you.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.100
What?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.066
Upstairs bathroom.

08:58.066 --> 08:59.467
What is it?

08:59.467 --> 09:03.033
What used to be in the
toilet is now in the tub.

09:03.033 --> 09:04.133
Check-in time is 4:00.

09:04.133 --> 09:05.767
Oh, great idea. I'm in!

09:05.767 --> 09:08.400
Let's pencil
that in for, say, 2023.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.533
Watch Liam for me. Come on.

09:12.467 --> 09:15.400
Brother, you gotta stop
embarrassing yourself.

09:15.400 --> 09:19.033
Fiona's a hood girl,
not a debutante from Glencoe.

09:19.033 --> 09:20.533
It's painful, man!

09:20.533 --> 09:23.433
You always asking her on
lunches, taking a getaway?

09:23.433 --> 09:25.633
What's next,
coed bikini waxes
and a spa day?

09:25.633 --> 09:29.367
When she says, "Fuck you,"
it means "I like you."

09:29.367 --> 09:31.367
It's hood-girl speak.
Learn the language.

09:31.367 --> 09:32.533
Okay, any suggestions?

09:32.533 --> 09:35.533
All day, all she does
is make decisions.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.333
Five kids, fuckin' Frank?

09:38.333 --> 09:40.734
Stop asking her what she needs.
Fucking tell her.

09:48.433 --> 09:50.033
Hey, change your mind
about that movie?

09:50.033 --> 09:51.633
Where's Mickey?

09:51.633 --> 09:54.266
Downstate picking up
our dad from prison. Why?

09:54.266 --> 09:55.567
What the hell, Ian?!

09:58.433 --> 10:00.700
What are you doing?

10:04.367 --> 10:06.467
Mickey will kill you.

10:09.133 --> 10:11.266
What do you want?!

10:11.266 --> 10:12.300
Ian!
