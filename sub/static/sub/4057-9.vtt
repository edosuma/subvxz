00:00.984 --> 00:02.779
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.803 --> 00:04.640
It's him. He's the one
taking the bodies.

00:04.665 --> 00:06.157
Then I think I know
where he's taking them.

00:06.181 --> 00:09.585
Someone is trying to make supernatural
creatures with non-supernatural means.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.826
It's only really over when
it starts turning silver...

00:11.851 --> 00:13.557
That's when they know
you're really a failure.

00:13.581 --> 00:14.624
Kira, I don't want you to leave.

00:14.648 --> 00:15.792
And I don't want to hurt anyone.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.209
Something's changed.

00:17.233 --> 00:18.628
And I think it's because of me.

00:18.652 --> 00:19.892
And I don't know how to fix it.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.897
My asthma is back.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.513
I'm not sure how,
but it came back.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.515
Just as bad as it used to be.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.450
So now, I keep my inhaler
on me all of the time.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.319
Just like I used to.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.321
And it's been five days.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.772
We haven't seen
any new Chimeras,

00:45.796 --> 00:47.276
and we haven't seen
the Dread Doctors.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.548
We all go to school,

00:51.452 --> 00:52.678
pretending like
nothing's happened.

00:52.702 --> 00:53.930
But everyone seems to know.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.565
You just walk down the
halls and no one's smiling.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.602
No one's laughing.

00:58.626 --> 01:01.593
You get the feeling that everyone
can sense that something's coming.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.808
They just don't know what is, or

01:04.831 --> 01:06.431
how bad it's going to be.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.614
Every time I feel like I
should do something about it,

01:11.638 --> 01:13.350
I find myself reaching
for my inhaler.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.468
Like, I'm going
to take a hit of it

01:15.492 --> 01:18.253
and, and come up with some brilliant
solution on how to save everyone.

01:18.445 --> 01:19.845
But I don't know what to do.

01:21.515 --> 01:22.681
I don't think anyone does.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.745
Maybe that's why no one's
really talking to each other.

01:29.023 --> 01:30.689
Sometimes we don't
even notice each other.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.343
But I think some of
us are okay with that.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.407
Because not talking makes
it easier to keep secrets.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.991
And I don't know if anyone's
really lying about things.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.715
Maybe it's more like
lies of omission.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.965
Maybe the worst lie
is to Stilinski.

02:01.989 --> 02:03.709
Because no one's told him
about Parrish yet.

02:08.027 --> 02:09.627
Then again, no one's
told Parrish either.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.010
He doesn't seem to
remember taking the bodies.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.578
And we think that
he's only really dangerous

02:15.602 --> 02:16.902
if you try to get in his way.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.583
If Stilinski knew the truth,

02:20.607 --> 02:21.718
he'd definitely get in his way.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.921
So Lydia and Stiles are
trying to find the bodies,

02:24.945 --> 02:26.745
which means finding the Nemeton.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.031
They're driving around,
searching all of the woods.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.800
But the last time
that we found this thing,

02:36.824 --> 02:38.790
three of us had almost
drowned in ice water.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.237
We're not the only ones
looking for Chimeras...

02:46.800 --> 02:49.546
Stilinski's got everyone
looking for the next target.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.548
Questioning anyone
who's a genetic Chimera.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.617
Anyone who's got
two sets of DNA.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.401
No one really knows
what they're looking for.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.225
Some think it's a serial killer.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.448
Some probably know it's worse.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.721
The two Chimeras that we
know about, Hayden and Corey...

03:12.793 --> 03:14.126
They're both doing okay.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.238
Actually, better than okay. They're
healing faster and getting stronger.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.402
They don't need our help.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.372
And I don't think
they'd want it anyway.

03:35.682 --> 03:36.962
I still haven't heard from Kira.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.587
And I'm getting more and
more worried about Deaton.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.971
I know something's coming.

03:47.995 --> 03:51.563
And all I can think about is how good
am I going to be if I can't even breathe?

03:54.835 --> 03:57.547
You sound like
you're trying to apologize.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.449
You came back
looking for an Alpha.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.972
I guess I'm sorry
that you found me.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.753
I'm not sorry.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.622
You still want to be
part of the pack?

04:05.646 --> 04:07.579
Scott, I'm with you.

04:08.549 --> 04:09.748
For better or worse.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.617
Trust me.
There's gonna be worse.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.788
I'm counting on it.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.176
I need more time.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.014
Are you listening to me?
I said I need more time.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.017
Perigee-syzygy.

05:20.254 --> 05:21.731
The supermoon.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.956
We'll know
at the perigee-syzygy.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.906
But what about Hayden?

05:29.930 --> 05:31.140
Failure.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.042
No, no, no. Not to me.

05:34.066 --> 05:36.946
Failure compromises
the experiment pool.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.715
I kept Scott out of your way.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.883
I did everything you wanted.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.518
Now, I need Hayden alive.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.653
Inconsequential.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.655
You promised me a pack.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.957
We promised you nothing.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.581
I need her alive!

06:08.101 --> 06:11.202
Only until the perigee-syzygy.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.778
This definitely doesn't look
like an operating theater.

06:28.021 --> 06:31.134
Maybe it's more like
a remote field station.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.636
I'm starting to wonder if
maybe we're wasting our time

06:33.660 --> 06:35.160
looking for potential Chimeras,

06:36.930 --> 06:39.976
when maybe, we should
be looking for the failures.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.394
How do we do that?

06:42.418 --> 06:44.814
We equip every available
deputy with a UV light.

06:44.838 --> 06:45.937
What's UV going to show us?

06:49.209 --> 06:50.742
Mercury.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.823
I'll see you second period
for History, okay?

06:53.847 --> 06:54.980
Then lunch.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.082
I have Math after that.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.985
So, I'll find you at the bell.

07:03.357 --> 07:05.390
They only come out
after dark though, right?

07:07.060 --> 07:09.361
You don't have to check
on me every period.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.063
I want to.

07:12.699 --> 07:13.765
Okay.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.008
You're gonna be okay.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.031
Don't tell anyone.

07:47.401 --> 07:48.700
You can't tell anyone.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.825
It's almost like this thing
doesn't want to be found.

08:02.849 --> 08:04.249
Maybe it knows
we're late for class.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.719
Because we've been here twice.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.800
Crap.

08:10.824 --> 08:11.868
Can we talk to Parrish now?

08:11.892 --> 08:13.069
Hang on.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.737
If the Nemeton's
covered in bodies,

08:14.761 --> 08:15.805
shouldn't you be
able to find them?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.140
Me? Yes, you.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.657
That's what you do.

08:18.681 --> 08:20.176
You're the Banshee,
you find the bodies.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.444
Well, the Banshee's
having an off day,

08:21.468 --> 08:23.046
so how about we talk to Parrish?

08:23.070 --> 08:24.280
We can't.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.304
Why not?

08:27.708 --> 08:28.973
Because one of the bodies...

08:32.245 --> 08:35.158
One of them...
One of them could be...

08:35.182 --> 08:36.347
Could be what?

08:37.851 --> 08:39.284
One of them could be a clue.

08:41.488 --> 08:42.965
I'm leaving now, Stiles.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.399
I'm going to talk to Parrish

08:44.423 --> 08:46.143
and tell him he's the one
taking the bodies.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.240
It's always better
when they know.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.364
Well then, he should know
he owes me a Jeep.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.238
Hey.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.109
What are you doing? Nothing.

09:40.514 --> 09:43.359
Hey, Liam, just remember
it's a full moon tomorrow.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.894
And you're probably
already starting to feel it.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.763
I know.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.498
It's a supermoon. Which means
it's gonna be closer to the Earth...

09:48.522 --> 09:50.889
Yeah, I... I know what it means.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.559
Okay.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.997
Well, just remember,
I'm here for you.

10:06.907 --> 10:10.019
You going to chain me
to the tree again?

10:10.043 --> 10:13.089
All I meant was, it might be a
good idea if we stick together.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.279
So we can protect each other.

10:22.490 --> 10:23.756
We can't protect anyone.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.175
You guys are sure that's where
Parrish is taking the bodies?

10:32.199 --> 10:34.410
Lydia says that's what
happens in his dream.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.078
I mean, you know
if Lydia finds the Nemeton,

10:36.102 --> 10:37.462
she's also going
to find Donovan...

10:40.540 --> 10:42.051
Sorry.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.275
She's also going to find Josh.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.760
You know what, maybe she should.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.528
I think things are
different now for Scott.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.864
Especially after
what he did to Corey.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.900
I don't think he's going to
blame us for defending ourselves.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.290
I know he won't blame you.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.525
You're getting stronger.

11:35.595 --> 11:36.995
How strong am I supposed to get?

11:37.998 --> 11:39.097
Let's find out.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.039
Wow.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.409
Yeah.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.414
Does this mean
I'm their success?

11:58.485 --> 11:59.517
I don't know.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.253
But Scott might.

12:05.425 --> 12:09.327
I know the last time you
saw him wasn't his best day.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.230
But he's trying to help.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.099
More than most people would.

12:23.583 --> 12:24.749
Seriously?

12:25.351 --> 12:26.416
Why not?

13:06.653 --> 13:08.597
Why are you telling me
about library key cards?

13:08.621 --> 13:11.534
The system logged two names
right around the time of the 9-1-1 call.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.592
Theo Raeken
and your son, Stiles.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.440
You sure this kid's guilty?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.574
Absolutely.

13:18.598 --> 13:19.976
Then all you got to do is wait.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.577
If they're really guilty,

13:21.601 --> 13:24.246
eventually they make a mistake.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.536
They always make a mistake.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.659
Hey.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.028
I need to talk to you about
something. You okay?

13:39.052 --> 13:41.163
It's not really about me.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.747
But it's something I probably
should've told you a long time ago.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.158
What is it?

13:49.462 --> 13:50.462
It's about Stiles.

13:52.599 --> 13:55.166
Wait... Do you hear that?

13:56.770 --> 13:58.503
Is that the police?

13:59.773 --> 14:00.773
It's an ambulance.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.645
He just started bleeding
everywhere. I don't...

14:08.681 --> 14:10.248
Don't let them do it.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.328
Don't let them kill me!

14:12.352 --> 14:13.552
Scott, we have to follow them.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.440
We gotta protect him, right?

14:17.223 --> 14:18.289
Scott, come on.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.392
Scott?

14:23.096 --> 14:24.295
Scott, this is what you do.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.684
It's Corey, isn't it?

14:35.708 --> 14:37.086
Yeah. They're taking
him to the hospital.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.555
That means I'm next.
They're coming for me.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.340
They're coming for all of us, which
is why we have to get out of here.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.792
Hey, what did you want
to talk to me about?

14:57.764 --> 14:59.341
It can wait.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.510
If something's wrong,
you should tell me.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.534
We've all got to start
talking to each other again.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.850
This might not be the best
place to start, Scott.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.507
You think I'm going to be angry?

15:09.843 --> 15:11.420
Not with me.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.844
Theo, you can talk to me.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.418
Open the glove compartment.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.602
It belonged to Stiles.

15:39.305 --> 15:40.671
He dropped it at the school.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.141
Dropped it when?

15:44.544 --> 15:45.643
When he killed Donovan.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.335
What are you talking about?

15:59.359 --> 16:00.799
You know he hurt
his shoulder, right?

16:00.927 --> 16:02.438
You smelled the blood.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.306
That was the Jeep. He

16:04.330 --> 16:05.441
said the Jeep's hood
fell on him.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.643
No, no, no, that was Donovan.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.400
He went after Stiles
at the library.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.648
I only saw the end of it.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.416
And when I saw
what Stiles was doing...

16:14.440 --> 16:15.506
I couldn't stop him.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.256
I shouldn't... I shouldn't
be telling you this.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.223
You should hear this from him...

16:21.247 --> 16:22.313
Tell me.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.632
I saw Donovan go down.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.834
Stiles hit him with the wrench,

16:31.858 --> 16:33.578
and then, he just,
he just kept hitting him.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.305
Uh, maybe it was because he...

16:36.329 --> 16:37.522
He threatened to kill his dad.

16:37.546 --> 16:38.741
Or maybe Stiles thought
he had to keep going

16:38.765 --> 16:40.676
to defend himself,

16:40.700 --> 16:43.612
but he just...
He kept hitting him.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.214
That's not possible.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.704
He crushed that kid's skull.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.251
I heard it cracking

16:49.275 --> 16:50.753
and splintering.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.388
By the time
I pulled Stiles off him,

16:52.412 --> 16:53.812
half of Donovan's head
was caved in.

16:57.884 --> 16:58.884
It didn't even look real.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.621
I keep telling myself
that it was self-defense...

17:04.656 --> 17:05.856
It was self-defense, but...

17:08.560 --> 17:09.827
Scott, I'm sorry.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.508
I've never seen
anything like it.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.298
And I've never seen
anyone that angry.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.903
You... You should
talk to Stiles.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.540
You have to talk to him.

17:25.244 --> 17:28.390
One of the more common
biological weapons, anthrax,

17:28.414 --> 17:30.859
was used by Germany
in World War I,

17:30.883 --> 17:32.628
and in human experimentation

17:32.652 --> 17:34.585
by the Japanese
during World War II...

17:45.999 --> 17:47.810
Beth...

17:47.834 --> 17:49.979
Please close your computer.

17:50.003 --> 17:51.335
I won't ask again.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.929
Beth. Beth!

18:21.634 --> 18:24.713
Malia, if you need to use
the restroom, it's one at time.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.649
And if you're planning
on leaving class,

18:26.673 --> 18:28.450
I'd consider your
recent drop in grades.

18:28.474 --> 18:29.807
She needs help. Not from you.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.345
You know what's going on.
Don't you?

18:35.315 --> 18:36.759
I know that I'd like to see you

18:36.783 --> 18:38.961
get through senior year
with passing grades.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.518
You know more than that.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.792
I think you need to focus
more on your schoolwork.

18:48.661 --> 18:49.694
All of you.

18:55.535 --> 18:56.845
So, if this
place is so important,

18:56.869 --> 18:58.714
how come you didn't want
to show it to me before?

18:58.738 --> 19:01.083
Well, the problem is
it's not easy to find.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.227
Should we put it in the GPS?

19:04.010 --> 19:05.376
Not exactly.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.678
So, how are we going to find it?

19:09.716 --> 19:12.750
Because I don't remember ever
being anywhere near a giant tree stump.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.998
I think you're already
starting to remember.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.666
How do you know that?

19:17.690 --> 19:18.889
You just took a right turn.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.814
Beth?

19:31.838 --> 19:34.383
Are you okay? Why
are you talking to me?

19:34.407 --> 19:35.650
You don't know me.

19:35.674 --> 19:36.919
You don't know anything
about my condition.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.654
What?

19:38.678 --> 19:39.918
What do you mean? My condition.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.391
My condition.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.093
My condition.

19:44.117 --> 19:45.437
Hey, you don't
want to be alone...

19:54.560 --> 19:55.860
Are you kidding me?

19:56.662 --> 19:57.728
Beth!

20:34.667 --> 20:35.733
They're already here.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.641
This wasn't them.

20:44.944 --> 20:45.944
It was Corey.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.186
Malia? Hey.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.809
Hey. What happened?

21:20.680 --> 21:21.745
I hate this.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.927
I hate losing like this.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.462
I'm not like Scott.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.052
I can't deal with another body.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.554
Another failure.

21:41.567 --> 21:42.567
Security's still looking.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.002
I haven't seen anything either.

21:51.611 --> 21:52.910
Now they're here.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.778
We better go.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.115
We need to find Hayden.

23:07.653 --> 23:10.198
Lydia, for the love of God,
answer your phone.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.433
There's another dead Chimera.

23:12.457 --> 23:14.670
So right now is probably not a
great time to be alone with Parrish.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.204
If he's coming to get the
body, you can't get in his way.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.095
Lydia, do not get in his way.

23:21.767 --> 23:22.833
Anything look familiar?

23:23.135 --> 23:24.746
Nothing.

23:24.770 --> 23:27.249
I'm trying, but it all
looks like woods to me.

23:27.273 --> 23:30.052
Maybe you're thinking
about it too much.

23:30.076 --> 23:33.589
Maybe it's something
you need to feel.

23:33.613 --> 23:34.812
How do I do that?

23:36.215 --> 23:39.628
What was that for?

23:39.652 --> 23:40.884
To get you to stop thinking.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.032
Oh, is this supposed
to motivate me?

23:44.056 --> 23:45.633
No.

23:45.657 --> 23:47.235
It's supposed to
get you to stop...

23:47.259 --> 23:48.392
thinking!

24:38.310 --> 24:40.444
Give the M.E. five
minutes, all right?

24:44.350 --> 24:45.716
Come here.

24:47.453 --> 24:49.230
Where's Scott?

24:49.254 --> 24:51.033
He's looking for Liam.
He thinks he's with Hayden.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.377
All right. I need
a word with you.

24:53.693 --> 24:54.858
Just you.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.233
Am I going to need a lawyer?

25:04.804 --> 25:05.869
You tell me.

25:08.374 --> 25:09.374
Stiles wasn't there.

25:11.711 --> 25:12.976
But Donovan was.

25:15.414 --> 25:16.414
He was a Chimera.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.127
A Wendigo.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.229
He was looking for Stiles.

25:21.253 --> 25:22.786
He was going to kill him.

25:27.793 --> 25:30.160
Donovan said that he wanted
to kill Stiles in front of you.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.057
When he saw me there instead,

25:33.081 --> 25:34.710
he tried to get me to
tell him where Stiles was.

25:34.734 --> 25:35.799
What did you tell him?

25:36.268 --> 25:37.479
Nothing.

25:37.503 --> 25:39.136
So he came at me.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.884
I tried to fight him off, but...

25:42.908 --> 25:43.919
All I kept thinking was that...

25:43.943 --> 25:45.320
I can't let him kill me.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.055
And I can't let him kill Stiles.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.256
I climbed up this scaffolding,

25:48.280 --> 25:50.358
but he started to drag me down.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.927
Then these support beams,

25:51.951 --> 25:53.544
they slid off the top.

25:53.568 --> 25:55.888
When I looked back, one of
them had gone right through him.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.801
I didn't...
I didn't know what to do.

25:59.825 --> 26:03.038
I dialed 9-1-1, but when the
deputy got there, the body was gone.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.773
Even the blood.
Everything was just...

26:04.797 --> 26:05.874
It was gone, and I didn't...

26:05.898 --> 26:07.264
I didn't know what to do.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.234
So I didn't do anything.

26:14.306 --> 26:15.306
I'm sorry.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.921
I didn't know what else
to do. So, I didn't...

26:19.945 --> 26:21.011
I didn't do anything.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.432
You know the combination?

26:30.456 --> 26:31.822
12-34-56.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.425
But that's...

26:36.796 --> 26:38.295
Yeah, Phil's an idiot.

26:51.443 --> 26:54.289
My sister's going to go out of
her mind worrying about me.

26:54.313 --> 26:55.913
We'll come up with
something to tell her.

27:03.155 --> 27:03.631
How far are we gonna go?

27:03.655 --> 27:04.132
Wherever's far enough, I guess.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.522
What if I turn out like Tracy?

27:06.559 --> 27:07.891
What if I hurt you?

27:09.562 --> 27:10.828
I'll get over it.

27:31.016 --> 27:33.417
Oh, God. They're here.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.073
I need to call it in.

28:52.097 --> 28:54.109
No, I need to turn myself in.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.911
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.445
You just told me I'm the
one taking the bodies.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.314
I've attacked other law
enforcement officers.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.448
That's a criminal offense.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.016
I shouldn't even be near you.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.585
I'm not afraid of
you. I'm afraid of me.

29:03.609 --> 29:05.453
Whatever's happening

29:05.477 --> 29:06.955
seems to only happen
when there's a body.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.178
Other than that

29:09.615 --> 29:11.593
you're still a pretty nice guy.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.361
And you're a pretty good deputy.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.130
I'm a very good deputy.
And I'd like to stay that way.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.932
Flipping over Jeeps
and attacking colleagues

29:16.956 --> 29:19.100
doesn't exactly fit
with "protect and serve."

29:19.124 --> 29:20.635
I'm covering up the bodies
of murdered teenagers.

29:20.659 --> 29:22.092
You're not covering them up...

29:22.661 --> 29:25.696
Actually, maybe you are.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.259
What?

29:28.283 --> 29:30.483
It's the same thing we asked
Stilinski to do with Tracy.

29:31.236 --> 29:32.469
You're not covering up bodies.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.250
You're covering up
the supernatural.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.418
What's the difference?

29:36.442 --> 29:37.882
Maybe you're keeping
the secret safe.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.089
Maybe that's part of
what you do.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.245
I'm a deputy.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.015
You're not just a deputy.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.595
And you aren't
one of the bad guys.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.539
Lydia, you just showed me
that my dream was real.

29:50.689 --> 29:52.129
But you haven't
heard the rest of it.

29:56.362 --> 29:57.706
Every time I carry
a body to the Nemeton,

29:57.730 --> 29:59.296
I put it down and

30:01.333 --> 30:02.853
add to the ones
that are already there.

30:06.171 --> 30:07.304
How many?

30:09.775 --> 30:11.141
Hundreds, Lydia.

30:12.077 --> 30:13.143
Hundreds of them.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.323
Run. Hayden, run!

32:02.187 --> 32:03.298
Get Hayden out of here.

32:03.322 --> 32:04.387
Go!

32:04.790 --> 32:05.856
Hayden?

32:09.795 --> 32:11.561
Hayden! Hayden!

32:57.876 --> 32:59.154
I need more time.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.389
The perigee-syzygy.

33:01.413 --> 33:02.546
Until then.

33:02.915 --> 33:04.948
Perigee-syzygy.

33:29.875 --> 33:31.241
Where's Hayden?

33:38.617 --> 33:39.683
I'm okay.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.653
Really, I think I'm okay.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.839
I saw the needle go in,

33:51.863 --> 33:54.609
and her eyes just
filled up with mercury.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.299
They turned completely silver.

33:57.970 --> 33:59.269
She looks okay.

34:00.973 --> 34:02.339
Maybe she'll heal.

34:02.808 --> 34:03.808
Or maybe she won't.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.815
What if something's happening
to her on the inside?

34:15.420 --> 34:16.686
Get them to the Animal Clinic.

34:17.589 --> 34:18.922
I'll meet you there.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.685
Keep her awake.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.829
I don't think it's a good idea
for her to fall asleep.

34:40.012 --> 34:41.489
Hayden?

34:41.513 --> 34:43.024
Hayden, you gotta stay awake.

34:43.047 --> 34:44.759
I'm so tired.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.828
Yeah, I know, but
you can't go to sleep.

34:46.851 --> 34:48.596
- How do we help her?
- I don't know.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.465
When it's wolfsbane
poisoning, you burn it out.

34:50.489 --> 34:53.301
But I don't know
anything about mercury.

34:53.324 --> 34:54.835
Especially a kind that's
probably been altered by them.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.437
Is she going to heal?

34:56.460 --> 34:58.873
The problem is she's
not really like us, Liam.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.342
None of them are. They're more
like, like cheap knockoffs.

35:01.366 --> 35:02.806
She might not be
as strong as we are.

35:03.335 --> 35:04.679
Or heal like we do.

35:04.703 --> 35:05.835
She's not a real werewolf.

35:07.472 --> 35:08.850
What if we turn her into one?

35:08.874 --> 35:10.685
Nice idea.

35:10.709 --> 35:11.949
Except you and I can't do that.

35:12.778 --> 35:13.877
But Scott can.

35:28.093 --> 35:29.704
Hey.

35:29.728 --> 35:30.772
What the hell does
he think he's doing?

35:30.796 --> 35:31.861
Protecting us.

35:32.964 --> 35:33.964
From who?

35:34.666 --> 35:35.865
Himself.

35:46.044 --> 35:47.044
No!

35:49.448 --> 35:51.748
I get why you sat me at a
desk for six months now.

35:54.686 --> 35:57.565
Parrish, we can't
keep you in here.

35:57.589 --> 35:58.955
There's another body, right?

36:02.861 --> 36:03.927
Two, actually.

36:12.738 --> 36:13.803
I'm the one taking them.

36:17.042 --> 36:20.455
I, I don't know why,

36:20.479 --> 36:22.390
and I definitely don't
remember doing it.

36:22.414 --> 36:24.695
But if it really was me at the
morgue, then I'm dangerous.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.918
Okay? You can't
let me out, Sheriff.

36:33.425 --> 36:34.657
You can't.

36:52.644 --> 36:54.122
Hey, sorry...

36:54.146 --> 36:55.723
I had trouble
starting the Jeep again.

36:55.747 --> 36:56.987
That thing's barely hanging on.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.550
I couldn't get in touch
with Malia or Lydia.

37:05.924 --> 37:06.990
Scott?

37:17.702 --> 37:18.968
Where did you get that?

37:20.939 --> 37:22.038
This is yours?

37:32.184 --> 37:33.516
Why didn't you tell me?

37:35.554 --> 37:36.953
I was going to.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.704
No, but why didn't you
tell me when it happened?

37:43.662 --> 37:44.894
I couldn't.

37:47.132 --> 37:48.231
You killed him?

37:50.168 --> 37:51.601
You killed Donovan?

37:52.871 --> 37:54.604
Well, he was going
to kill my dad.

37:55.740 --> 37:57.140
Huh? Was I supposed
to just let him?

37:58.210 --> 37:59.909
You weren't supposed to do this.

38:01.146 --> 38:02.479
None of us are.

38:07.752 --> 38:09.018
You think I had a choice?

38:10.755 --> 38:12.199
There's always a choice.

38:12.223 --> 38:13.668
Yeah, well, I can't do
what you can, Scott.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.937
I know you wouldn't
have done it.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.672
You probably would've just
figured something out, right?

38:17.696 --> 38:18.940
I'd try.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.741
Yeah, because
you're Scott McCall!

38:20.765 --> 38:22.210
You're the true Alpha!

38:22.234 --> 38:24.212
Guess what? All of us
can't be true Alphas.

38:24.236 --> 38:27.048
Some of us have
to make mistakes.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.584
Some of us have to get our
hands a little bloody sometimes.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.074
Some of us are human!

38:31.910 --> 38:33.209
So, you had to kill him?

38:35.213 --> 38:37.013
Scott, he was going
to kill my dad.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.627
But the way that it happened...

38:39.651 --> 38:41.529
There's a point when it's...

38:41.553 --> 38:43.030
It's not self-defense anymore!

38:43.054 --> 38:45.199
What are you even talking about?

38:45.223 --> 38:46.990
I didn't have a choice, Scott!

38:51.630 --> 38:52.950
You don't even
believe me, do you?

38:54.599 --> 38:55.599
I want to.

38:57.602 --> 38:58.868
Okay, all right, so...

38:59.571 --> 39:00.837
So, believe me then.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.309
Scott, say you believe me.

39:11.249 --> 39:12.249
Say it.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.019
Say you believe me.

39:18.156 --> 39:20.316
Stiles, we can't kill people
that we're trying to save.

39:23.228 --> 39:24.228
Say you believe me.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.036
We can't kill people!

39:34.673 --> 39:35.972
Do you believe that?

39:42.314 --> 39:44.714
Well, what do I do about this?

39:47.852 --> 39:50.598
What do you want me to do?
Okay, just be...

39:50.622 --> 39:52.589
Scott, just tell me how
to fix this, all right?

39:55.126 --> 39:57.093
Please, just tell me,
what do you want me to do?

40:04.703 --> 40:06.936
Don't worry about
Malia or Lydia.

40:08.340 --> 40:09.340
We'll find them.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.009
Maybe...

40:14.879 --> 40:16.312
Maybe you should
talk to your dad.

40:42.841 --> 40:43.884
She's getting worse.

40:43.908 --> 40:45.753
I think she's dying.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.577
It's got to be some kind
of mercury poisoning.

40:48.246 --> 40:50.992
Scott, remember
what you promised me.

40:51.016 --> 40:53.016
You said you'd do everything
you could to save her.

40:54.185 --> 40:55.825
If she's a real werewolf,
we can save her.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.789
You gotta give her the bite.

41:10.368 --> 41:11.434
No.
