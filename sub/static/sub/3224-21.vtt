WEBVTT

00:03.953 --> 00:06.046
Angels are slaughtering one another.

00:06.255 --> 00:07.654
It's open warfare.

00:08.324 --> 00:10.952
- What happened here?
- Astrange angel arrived.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.889
He said he worked for the new God.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.064
I will find Metatron,
and I will make him pay.

00:15.264 --> 00:18.392
Lead the angels against me, Castiel.

00:18.601 --> 00:22.002
I know who you really are, Gadreel.

00:22.205 --> 00:24.799
- What is it you want of me, Metatron?
- Rebuild Heaven.

00:25.007 --> 00:28.465
You want to be my second-in-command,
prove you're ready.

00:28.678 --> 00:30.805
When you find him,
say "Poughkeepsie."

00:31.013 --> 00:32.275
- Poughkeepsie.
- It's our go word.

00:32.482 --> 00:33.842
It means
"drop everything and run."

00:34.016 --> 00:36.177
Take control, Sam!
Cast him out!

00:36.386 --> 00:38.650
Metatron made Gadreel kill Kevin.

00:38.855 --> 00:40.254
It would explain a lot.

00:40.656 --> 00:43.523
No. Do it! Kill me!

00:43.726 --> 00:45.086
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

00:45.094 --> 00:46.652
Well, you can sit here and rot.

00:46.863 --> 00:48.956
Was the Winchesters grabbing me
part of your plan?

00:49.165 --> 00:50.928
That was a surprise.

00:51.134 --> 00:54.365
But I know something
they don't know... the ending.

00:56.372 --> 00:58.897
Abaddon. She's a demon.
Who is a Knight of Hell.

00:59.108 --> 01:00.708
Do you know what I find
the most shocking

01:00.910 --> 01:02.070
about time-traveling
through a closet?

01:02.278 --> 01:05.075
Somebody thought it was a good idea
to make you the King of Hell.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.840
I am your ki...

01:08.050 --> 01:10.018
You and I are gonna talk about
a regime change.

01:10.219 --> 01:11.939
A devil's trap
carved into the bullet.

01:12.088 --> 01:13.578
It's gonna keep you from smoking out.

01:16.726 --> 01:18.921
The Knights of Hell
aren't exactly the dying kind.

01:19.128 --> 01:20.686
But there is something
that can kill a knight.

01:20.897 --> 01:22.125
The First Blade.

01:22.331 --> 01:23.696
It's the bloody Mark of Cain.

01:23.900 --> 01:26.164
Without the Mark,
the Blade is useless.

01:26.369 --> 01:27.666
The mark can be transferred
to someone who's worthy.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.566
But you have to know, with
the mark comes a great burden.

01:31.374 --> 01:33.808
They're seeing hellhounds,
demonic pit bulls.

01:35.144 --> 01:36.543
You can control them?

01:36.746 --> 01:38.737
Sic him, boy!

01:38.981 --> 01:40.380
Look at you.
You're a mess.

01:40.583 --> 01:41.914
It's your DNA.

01:42.118 --> 01:45.315
It's my addiction.
It makes you needy.

01:45.555 --> 01:48.251
She reported everything I did
back to Abaddon.

02:19.455 --> 02:22.151
What's that, you say?
"Come in"?

02:22.358 --> 02:24.121
Don't mind if I do.

02:24.927 --> 02:27.828
Who are you?
What do you want?

02:28.030 --> 02:29.622
I'm a friend of the family.

02:29.832 --> 02:31.026
And I want you.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.702
I have no idea who you are.

02:33.903 --> 02:36.804
But you'll be takin'
your leave now. Thank you.

02:38.174 --> 02:40.836
Yes. You're packing.

02:41.043 --> 02:42.704
Sailing for the colonies.

02:43.679 --> 02:46.341
I know all about it.
Change of plans.

02:50.353 --> 02:51.684
Oh...

02:52.355 --> 02:55.552
What's this, then?
Are we having a party?

02:58.728 --> 03:00.525
Yes.

03:00.730 --> 03:02.630
A farewell party.

03:30.993 --> 03:33.359
She has a big slice
of pizza in her hand

03:33.496 --> 03:35.396
we just got from the place
around the corner.

03:35.598 --> 03:36.878
And a seagull landed on her head

03:36.999 --> 03:39.661
and started flapping and distracted
her while another seagull...

03:39.869 --> 03:40.893
I can't tell you how great it feels

03:41.103 --> 03:42.703
to finally have a night off,
right, guys?

03:48.110 --> 03:49.338
This other seagull came...

03:49.545 --> 03:51.911
Get away from all the pressure,
you know?

03:52.114 --> 03:54.309
Anyways, so,
no one had any pizza after that.

03:54.517 --> 03:56.280
'Course, I can't really complain,

03:56.485 --> 03:59.477
being handpicked
by the big man himself.

03:59.655 --> 04:01.714
I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.

04:03.459 --> 04:04.653
'Cause it's Metatron.

04:06.729 --> 04:08.219
What about Metatron?

04:09.298 --> 04:12.961
Well... he's come to depend on me.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.535
So, you know, we're... tight.

04:15.738 --> 04:17.535
And I have to say,

04:17.740 --> 04:20.300
I've come to appreciate
the Met-man's vision.

04:20.476 --> 04:22.239
His vision?

04:22.445 --> 04:24.072
He threw us all out of Heaven!

04:24.280 --> 04:26.077
No, no, no. Big picture.

04:26.282 --> 04:29.479
He's giving the place a makeover,
bringing back the chosen few,

04:29.685 --> 04:32.347
starting with the...
chosen chosen few,

04:32.555 --> 04:34.216
if you know what I mean.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.568
These are dangerous times.

05:19.769 --> 05:21.498
You have to be careful what you say.

05:21.704 --> 05:24.400
You never know
who might be listening.

05:24.607 --> 05:27.132
- I said nothing.
- Oh, you said plenty.

05:27.343 --> 05:28.867
Apparently, you felt the need

05:29.078 --> 05:30.807
to discuss your relationship
with Metatron.

05:31.013 --> 05:32.446
- His strategies...
- No.

05:32.648 --> 05:34.047
Privileged information.

05:35.451 --> 05:39.182
You speak that freely,
and there are consequences.

05:39.388 --> 05:41.015
As you're about to find out.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.524
Is that... him?

05:51.801 --> 05:52.927
It is.

06:15.658 --> 06:17.353
- This is the address?
- Yeah.

06:21.697 --> 06:25.030
If you'll follow me,
the commander will see you now.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.998
The commander?

06:54.263 --> 06:55.560
Sir.

07:07.877 --> 07:09.936
Um... Dismissed.

07:12.748 --> 07:14.181
He can be a little stuffy.

07:14.383 --> 07:16.510
So... Commander?

07:16.719 --> 07:18.983
Yeah, not my idea.

07:19.188 --> 07:21.986
They had no leader,
and they insisted on following me.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.988
Yeah. No, we get it.
You're a rock star.

07:25.561 --> 07:28.962
Bartholomew is dead.
Malachi was murdered by Gadreel,

07:29.165 --> 07:30.996
and with Metatron as powerful
as he is now,

07:31.200 --> 07:32.497
I needed to do something.

07:32.701 --> 07:35.397
So this war between angels
is really gonna happen, huh?

07:36.238 --> 07:39.207
Not if I can find a diplomatic option
for getting rid of Metatron.

07:40.476 --> 07:41.773
Good luck with that.

07:43.712 --> 07:47.341
Dean, this angel-on-angel violence...
It has to end.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.144
Someone has to say, "enough."

07:50.286 --> 07:51.810
And that someone is you?

07:53.389 --> 07:56.552
That brings me to why you're here.

07:56.725 --> 07:57.749
We have a prisoner.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.019
It's an angel
from Metatron's inner circle.

08:00.229 --> 08:05.030
I need to know what they're planning.
So far, he's revealed nothing.

08:05.201 --> 08:08.432
So you're done with the rough stuff,
and you want us to be your goons?

08:08.637 --> 08:12.129
Well, you've had success
at these situations before.

08:13.976 --> 08:16.672
If you don't want to do it,
I understand.

08:17.713 --> 08:19.647
Who says I don't want to do it?

08:24.486 --> 08:26.386
So, here's the thing,
boys and girls.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.318
We have a crisis.

08:28.524 --> 08:31.459
Admittedly,
a crisis of my own making.

08:31.660 --> 08:34.094
In my extended absence,

08:34.296 --> 08:36.924
where I handled
sensitive matters of state,

08:37.131 --> 08:42.159
Abaddon made inroads
into my following, creating chaos.

08:42.337 --> 08:46.297
So I look to you,
my trusted advisors,

08:46.442 --> 08:51.539
to restore confidence,
to soothe those jangled nerves.

08:51.747 --> 08:55.342
The king is back,

08:55.551 --> 09:00.318
and the kingdom is once again
on sound footing.

09:00.556 --> 09:04.048
So, all those with me,
say "yo!"

09:11.300 --> 09:12.927
Yo!

09:16.438 --> 09:20.067
I mean, I'm literally with you,
not with you with you.

09:21.043 --> 09:22.772
You betrayed me?

09:24.013 --> 09:27.005
No one in the history of torture's
been tortured with torture

09:27.216 --> 09:29.912
like the torture
you'll be tortured with.

09:30.119 --> 09:32.053
Relax, everyone.
You did the new queen a solid.

09:32.254 --> 09:34.085
You are sitting
at the popular kids' table.

09:34.290 --> 09:36.485
Now, Crowley, let's talk turkey.

09:36.692 --> 09:38.922
I know you helped the Winchesters

09:39.094 --> 09:42.154
get their hands
on the First Blade, yes?

09:43.532 --> 09:48.026
And I'm hearing that one of them
also has the Mark of Cain.

09:48.971 --> 09:51.940
All bad news,
since the Blade is the one thing

09:52.207 --> 09:54.869
- that can bring about my...
- Utter destruction.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.778
To be indelicate.

09:58.981 --> 10:01.040
But here's the thing, pet...

10:01.550 --> 10:04.348
Same goes for you.
And once I'm gone,

10:04.520 --> 10:07.683
who do you think's next
on those cute boys' list?

10:09.425 --> 10:11.791
That's right.

10:11.994 --> 10:13.518
So let's get real.

10:13.729 --> 10:17.722
Join me in taking out the Winchesters
and that ridiculous Blade,

10:17.933 --> 10:20.424
and then we'll deal with each other.

10:22.338 --> 10:23.999
To be clear...

10:25.341 --> 10:27.468
...I'll not be joining you... ever.

10:27.676 --> 10:33.012
Except at your death scene,
where I shall burst into song.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.513
Goodbye.
You have no hold over me.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.242
Oh, no?

10:39.455 --> 10:42.982
Gavin, honey, say hello to Daddy.

10:44.259 --> 10:46.853
- How did you...
- I know a spell or two, Crowley.

10:48.364 --> 10:49.991
Are you mad?

10:50.199 --> 10:53.293
This is your big card?

10:53.502 --> 10:55.333
The boy and I loathe each other.

10:55.537 --> 10:57.505
I made it clear in the past,

10:57.706 --> 10:59.674
I don't care what happens
to the little bugger.

10:59.875 --> 11:01.433
No.

11:01.643 --> 11:03.770
But that was before.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.047
Wasn't it?

11:06.248 --> 11:08.648
See, I know all about
your little problem...

11:08.851 --> 11:10.716
bingeing on blood,

11:10.919 --> 11:12.978
going right to the edge
of being human.

11:13.188 --> 11:15.156
All of those human feelings.

11:15.357 --> 11:16.722
I'm clean.

11:16.925 --> 11:18.825
And I'm willing to bet

11:19.028 --> 11:21.462
that there's a smidgen
of humanity in there somewhere.

11:22.831 --> 11:25.265
Not a chance.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.536
Ah! I'm blind!

11:44.153 --> 11:45.643
Help! I beg you!

11:48.190 --> 11:51.421
You know, these ghoulish
party tricks don't impress.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.754
Seen worse, done worse.

11:53.962 --> 11:56.829
No! Please!

12:01.370 --> 12:03.065
You're playing a weak hand, Red!

12:10.712 --> 12:12.145
I beg you!

12:12.347 --> 12:14.815
You've made your point.

12:15.050 --> 12:16.210
Now, stop.

12:17.719 --> 12:19.778
Sure.

12:22.157 --> 12:24.352
You're wasting your time.
I have nothing to say.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.358
We disagree.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.861
There's no use torturing me.
I am a trained commando.

12:30.065 --> 12:32.693
- It won't work.
- Wow.

12:32.868 --> 12:34.859
Well, you just asked me to dance.

12:35.437 --> 12:37.405
Save it! Dean!

12:47.116 --> 12:49.414
He won't be telling us anything dead.

12:56.291 --> 12:58.491
Besides, you know, I'm...
I'm really starting to realize

12:58.627 --> 13:00.151
that he probably
doesn't know anything.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.125
He was probably just
pretending at the bar.

13:02.331 --> 13:05.232
Most likely, he's a nobody.
I mean, do the math.

13:05.434 --> 13:08.870
Ezra here is one
of Metatron's elite posse?

13:09.071 --> 13:10.231
Really?

13:11.240 --> 13:13.936
One of Metatron's most trusted
is hanging out at bars,

13:14.143 --> 13:16.103
blabbing about the boss.
Does that make any sense?

13:16.211 --> 13:19.408
Well, only if Metatron is purposely
surrounding himself with losers.

13:19.615 --> 13:21.014
- Exactly! Right?
- Yeah.

13:21.216 --> 13:22.205
What's this guy
even doing here?

13:22.317 --> 13:23.317
He's a wannabe.

13:23.485 --> 13:25.783
I mean, if he was a key player,
he would be up in Heaven

13:25.988 --> 13:27.580
with Metatron,
where all the action is.

13:27.789 --> 13:29.780
- Exactly.
- What if I'm a decoy?

13:31.627 --> 13:34.289
Or in deep cover?

13:34.496 --> 13:36.259
It's pathetic.

13:36.465 --> 13:38.160
Probably hasn't even been to Heaven,
not since the fall.

13:38.367 --> 13:40.699
- Of course not!
- Yes, I have.

13:40.903 --> 13:44.304
Buddy, the gates are sealed.
No one can get in.

13:44.506 --> 13:45.973
Who said anything about gates?

13:46.175 --> 13:48.234
You don't need gates
when you have a private portal.

13:50.612 --> 13:54.639
Right. If there was a doorway on
Earth, the angels would've sensed it.

13:54.816 --> 13:56.147
- You can't hide something like that.
- No.

13:56.351 --> 13:58.979
You can if it moves around
from place to place,

13:59.188 --> 14:02.316
if it's wherever the boss
wants it to be.

14:04.826 --> 14:07.488
You are not my father.

14:07.696 --> 14:11.427
My father was Fergus MacLeod,
a simple tailor.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.897
A drunk, a monster.

14:14.102 --> 14:15.763
Sounds about right.

14:15.971 --> 14:19.236
He looked nothing like you,
and I buried him.

14:19.441 --> 14:22.467
A lot can change in 291 years.

14:23.545 --> 14:24.739
What?

14:43.632 --> 14:45.190
Can you cook a pigeon on it?

14:46.868 --> 14:48.495
Not terribly quick, is he?

14:53.875 --> 14:56.469
Holy mother of God!

14:58.647 --> 15:01.741
We're amongst the stars!

15:01.950 --> 15:03.850
Are we in Heaven, then?

15:04.019 --> 15:05.680
You must be angels!

15:06.822 --> 15:08.050
Wow.

15:08.257 --> 15:10.157
I see. I got it.

15:10.359 --> 15:13.817
So, you heard a rumor about
Metatron's "secret portal,"

15:14.029 --> 15:15.269
and you decided to run with it.

15:15.330 --> 15:17.696
It's not a rumor.
He showed me.

15:17.933 --> 15:20.231
I get it. He's a fan.

15:20.435 --> 15:22.027
- A fan. Yeah.
- You're a fan.

15:22.237 --> 15:24.967
Just 'cause you're hot
for Metatron...

15:25.641 --> 15:27.370
...or Bieber or Beckham...

15:27.576 --> 15:29.601
Just 'cause you know
everything about them

15:29.811 --> 15:32.245
doesn't mean that
you actually know them.

15:32.447 --> 15:34.881
- Or that they even know you exist.
- Oh, that's cold, Sammy.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.880
I'm just sayin', man.

15:37.085 --> 15:39.883
I was interviewed personally
by Metatron for a key post.

15:40.088 --> 15:41.749
Yeah?

15:41.957 --> 15:44.391
Well, then...
then maybe you can tell me

15:44.593 --> 15:46.026
why you weren't at your key post

15:46.228 --> 15:48.696
and you were
hanging down here instead.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.234
Mm. Now, that blows.

15:53.435 --> 15:54.993
- He got passed over.
- Yeah.

15:55.137 --> 15:57.230
- I was a finalist.
- Oh, man.

15:57.439 --> 15:59.498
To get so close and
then get kicked downstairs.

15:59.708 --> 16:03.144
- It sucks to be you.
- Hardly anybody was chosen!

16:03.345 --> 16:05.813
And ground forces is still
a very important assignment.

16:06.014 --> 16:09.279
It was an honor to have even
been considered for the squad.

16:09.484 --> 16:10.644
What squad?
There is no squad.

16:10.786 --> 16:12.686
Yeah, says you.
It's a highly guarded secret.

16:13.288 --> 16:16.553
- Oh.
- And what you be doing, exactly?

16:19.428 --> 16:20.918
Hm?

16:21.163 --> 16:22.528
No?

16:22.731 --> 16:26.963
Wait a second.
Just, please...

16:27.135 --> 16:32.368
Clarify this for me.
You desperately wanted this job,

16:32.574 --> 16:34.098
but you didn't know what it was?

16:35.811 --> 16:37.642
Well, until you were chosen,

16:37.846 --> 16:41.942
the exact nature of the mission
was kept a secret.

16:42.084 --> 16:45.952
And... hardly anyone was chosen.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.490
Dim bulb.
No wonder he got bumped.

16:50.692 --> 16:51.692
Yeah.

16:51.860 --> 16:54.556
"Ground forces"?
"Elite secret squad"?

16:54.763 --> 16:56.683
- What's Metatron gearing up for?
- I don't know.

16:56.732 --> 16:59.667
Why don't we shove somebody through
the back door of Heaven and find out.

16:59.835 --> 17:03.532
Oh, wait. No.
It's portable and can't be found.

17:03.705 --> 17:06.070
You sold your soul?

17:06.273 --> 17:09.266
Sold it?
For an extra three inches of willy?

17:09.478 --> 17:11.069
Priorities change.

17:11.279 --> 17:14.271
I wasn't the bon vivant
that I am now.

17:15.550 --> 17:17.518
I'll simplify.

17:17.719 --> 17:20.313
My soul did a stint in Hell,
where it became demonized.

17:20.521 --> 17:24.185
Then I had to possess another person
so I could traffic with the living.

17:26.328 --> 17:27.352
Any of this sticking?

17:27.561 --> 17:30.258
I can't be consorting with a demon!

17:30.465 --> 17:34.196
Not just any demon.
I'm the king! The King of Hell!

17:37.038 --> 17:40.769
And there you were, worried the
old man wouldn't amount to much.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.394
It's unbelievable.

18:10.605 --> 18:12.402
I mean, he was fine when we left him.

18:12.607 --> 18:14.302
I barely touched the guy.

18:14.509 --> 18:17.273
Still shackled, no weapon.
It wasn't suicide.

18:17.479 --> 18:20.812
No. This was an angel kill.

18:22.150 --> 18:25.551
Okay. Well, I'm gonna say it.
Maybe your operation's been hacked.

18:25.754 --> 18:27.915
You know, Metatron's got
somebody on the inside.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.755
I was sure everyone here was loyal.

18:33.128 --> 18:35.688
Finally united by a common cause.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.661
Well, that's the problem.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.347
See, you don't think anybody's lying.

18:40.469 --> 18:42.061
I think everybody's lying.

18:43.572 --> 18:45.472
It's a gift.

18:47.509 --> 18:49.739
Let's do some nosin' around.

18:53.248 --> 18:54.613
Sam.

18:56.117 --> 18:59.018
- You have a moment?
- Yeah. What?

18:59.221 --> 19:03.419
I wanted to ask you about Gadreel,
the time he possessed you.

19:05.193 --> 19:06.490
It's not really something I like to...

19:06.695 --> 19:08.959
Sam, please.

19:13.602 --> 19:15.968
He didn't possess me completely.

19:16.171 --> 19:19.197
More like we...
shared housing.

19:19.407 --> 19:22.808
- I was still me.
- Did you ever sense a presence?

19:25.180 --> 19:27.580
I don't really know what I felt.

19:27.782 --> 19:30.615
I mean, maybe that I wasn't
completely alone.

19:30.819 --> 19:32.480
Did you ever feel threatened?

19:35.457 --> 19:36.549
No.

19:37.425 --> 19:39.188
More that he...

19:39.828 --> 19:43.889
...wasn't at rest.
Like he had unfinished business.

19:44.065 --> 19:48.161
Now that we know more about him,
I'd say he felt misunderstood.

19:49.838 --> 19:53.296
But not... not a danger,
not hostile.

19:55.210 --> 19:56.973
No.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.508
I was wrong, obviously.

20:02.784 --> 20:03.910
He killed Kevin.

20:14.696 --> 20:16.926
"Why do I hate you?"

20:18.466 --> 20:23.199
I mean, I beat you,
starved you, came home drunk,

20:23.405 --> 20:26.704
beat you some more, woke up hungover,

20:26.908 --> 20:30.173
and, yeah, I beat you.

20:30.378 --> 20:32.938
In all fairness, I didn't really
have any role models.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.616
- My mother was a witch!
- I grew up thinkin'...

20:35.817 --> 20:39.150
Knowin' I was nothin'.
Less than nothin'!

20:39.354 --> 20:42.380
You worked me harder than the horse!
You never let me go to school.

20:42.591 --> 20:44.616
To this day, I can't read!

20:44.826 --> 20:46.259
It's overrated.

20:46.461 --> 20:48.986
Most of Europe couldn't read.

20:49.698 --> 20:51.689
You want to read?

20:51.900 --> 20:53.299
Read.

20:58.373 --> 21:01.365
Some Buccaneers beat the Saints?

21:01.576 --> 21:03.544
Can this be?

21:07.682 --> 21:09.513
I can read.

21:10.418 --> 21:12.750
King of Hell. Plenty of perks.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.547
So...

21:16.758 --> 21:18.658
...if you're a king...

21:18.860 --> 21:21.954
...that would make me...
prince?

21:22.163 --> 21:24.597
And you say I've
never given you anything.

21:24.799 --> 21:27.063
A title!

21:27.268 --> 21:31.671
And if I was to accept you
as my father,

21:31.873 --> 21:35.240
you could keep me from
eternally burning in Hell?

21:36.945 --> 21:38.742
No matter my sins?

21:38.947 --> 21:41.609
You're negotiating with me?

21:41.816 --> 21:43.249
That's my boy.

21:44.619 --> 21:47.850
This might work out.

21:48.056 --> 21:51.150
For the first time in my entire life,

21:51.359 --> 21:54.351
I can see possibilities, a future...

21:54.562 --> 21:56.402
Just as soon as you
take me back to my own time

21:56.598 --> 21:59.123
and I can board that ship
for the new world.

22:00.435 --> 22:04.462
- About that ship...
- What about the ship?

22:10.612 --> 22:12.102
It's not important.

22:12.313 --> 22:14.804
You can tell Abaddon
I'm ready for that chat.

22:23.058 --> 22:25.117
Thank you for coming.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.155
And thank you for coming alone.

22:30.365 --> 22:33.334
I've seen you through
Sam Winchester's eyes,

22:33.501 --> 22:35.128
and he trusts you.

22:35.303 --> 22:37.737
You have a reputation for honor.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.406
In some circles.

22:40.575 --> 22:43.738
As for reputations,
yours precedes you.

22:43.945 --> 22:47.005
What happened in the Garden
was not my doing.

22:47.215 --> 22:50.013
I know you feel misunderstood.

22:50.251 --> 22:53.516
And you're eager to redeem
yourself and maybe more.

22:53.722 --> 22:57.522
You refer to my support of Metatron's
campaign to rebuild Heaven?

22:57.726 --> 22:59.125
Your support?

22:59.327 --> 23:02.023
You've recruited for him,
you've killed for him.

23:02.230 --> 23:06.564
And I know you truly believe
it's for the greater good,

23:06.768 --> 23:08.688
but you've placed your faith
in the wrong master.

23:08.770 --> 23:11.898
- You don't know him.
- I know him too well, Gadreel!

23:12.107 --> 23:14.302
I made the same mistake,
and it led to the fall.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.639
- Which led to my second chance.
- This is about more than just you.

23:17.846 --> 23:20.314
Castiel, are you suggesting
I change loyalties?

23:20.515 --> 23:22.949
I'm suggesting you reclaim
your original loyalty

23:23.151 --> 23:25.642
to the heaven and mission
we were made to serve.

23:25.854 --> 23:27.845
I thought that was
exactly what I was doing.

23:29.023 --> 23:30.490
You've been deceived.

23:30.692 --> 23:34.822
And as bad as you've had it,
all those centuries locked away,

23:35.029 --> 23:38.294
it will be much worse under Metatron.

23:41.870 --> 23:43.030
Castiel!

24:09.164 --> 24:10.222
Give me your hand.

24:13.001 --> 24:14.263
That's it.

24:23.611 --> 24:24.703
Drop the Blade, Dean.

24:26.147 --> 24:27.444
Dean!

24:28.817 --> 24:30.307
Dean.

24:30.985 --> 24:33.317
Dean.

24:33.555 --> 24:36.183
What's wrong with you?
You hear your phone?

24:36.357 --> 24:38.257
It's about time.
Where the hell have you been?

24:38.459 --> 24:42.361
I told you I'd be in touch
when I'd found Abaddon.

24:42.530 --> 24:43.895
Well... I'm in touch.

24:44.098 --> 24:45.793
Where are you?

24:46.000 --> 24:47.262
First things first.

24:47.468 --> 24:49.402
I'll give you the location
of the First Blade.

24:49.604 --> 24:53.040
You two fetch it,
I'll keep her in my sights,

24:53.241 --> 24:57.371
then we'll remove her
from the payroll for good.

25:17.565 --> 25:20.329
Come on, Crowley!

25:20.535 --> 25:23.698
You really... have to
hide the Blade in a corpse?

25:23.905 --> 25:26.635
Not with a corpse, but in a corpse?

25:26.841 --> 25:28.968
I got to say, it's not
the first place I'd look.

25:30.311 --> 25:32.711
All right, here we go.

25:36.084 --> 25:39.281
Dean? Do you hear that?

25:43.791 --> 25:45.486
I'm guessing hellhound.

25:47.462 --> 25:49.089
Go. Go!

26:01.142 --> 26:02.575
Oh.

26:05.747 --> 26:06.747
Hello?

26:06.915 --> 26:09.247
Damn it, Crowley,
the grave is guarded!

26:09.450 --> 26:12.681
- That's absurd.
- Hellhound!

26:12.854 --> 26:14.617
No, no, no, she was collected.

26:14.822 --> 26:16.949
- The hell she was!
- Guys!

26:17.158 --> 26:19.592
Time was, no one would dare
disobey the king.

26:19.794 --> 26:22.558
- Guys!
- I'm gonna put you on speaker!

26:24.732 --> 26:28.759
Juliet? It's Papa.

26:28.970 --> 26:30.961
Stand down.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.507
You're welcome.

27:07.375 --> 27:09.172
All right.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.401
Goin' in.

27:10.611 --> 27:12.476
Hey, you know what? Maybe...

27:12.680 --> 27:14.773
Maybe I should do this.

27:14.983 --> 27:16.507
Sam, it's fine.

27:16.684 --> 27:19.244
I can safely grab it
without... you know...

27:36.771 --> 27:39.069
Well, let's go kill
a Knight of Hell, huh?

27:39.273 --> 27:40.365
Yeah.

27:41.309 --> 27:43.038
What're you talking about?

27:43.244 --> 27:44.643
Of course I'm boardin' the ship
when I go back!

27:44.846 --> 27:46.404
I want to go back to my life!

27:46.614 --> 27:48.104
It's not a good idea.

27:48.316 --> 27:51.285
I'm going to the colonies.
I'm workin' my way across.

27:51.519 --> 27:54.147
- I've given my word!
- Gavin, listen to your father.

27:54.322 --> 27:56.017
I know what's...

27:57.859 --> 27:59.724
...best for you.

28:01.162 --> 28:02.322
Kids.

28:05.566 --> 28:07.033
Squirrel.

28:07.235 --> 28:09.203
I hope you were nice to your father.

28:09.404 --> 28:12.771
What? Shut up.
Look, we got the Blade.

28:12.974 --> 28:16.000
You do? Well, you need
to get it here at once.

28:16.210 --> 28:19.702
Cleveland, Humboldt Hotel.
Penthouse, of course.

28:19.914 --> 28:22.178
When you get here,
I'll take you to Abaddon.

28:22.383 --> 28:28.288
I'll draw her out, and then
you can skewer the ignorant hag.

28:29.724 --> 28:32.318
- Just selling it.
- All right, we're on our way.

28:32.527 --> 28:34.722
Oh, and, Dean,
you need to get a move on.

28:34.929 --> 28:37.124
It's a good day's drive
from Poughkeepsie.

28:37.331 --> 28:39.094
What are you talking about?
We're not even near there.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.790
Yeah, like I said,

28:41.002 --> 28:42.697
you need to leave Poughkeepsie
right away.

28:45.873 --> 28:47.238
So, we good?

28:49.944 --> 28:51.309
Yeah.

28:57.852 --> 28:59.285
Nice.

28:59.487 --> 29:00.818
But here's the thing,

29:01.022 --> 29:03.650
you've been plotting with those boys
for some time now.

29:03.858 --> 29:05.951
When they get here, it'll be you,

29:06.160 --> 29:08.685
the Winchesters, the First Blade,

29:08.896 --> 29:12.024
and little, old me in one place.

29:13.568 --> 29:15.468
Now, I don't mind stiff odds, but...

29:16.737 --> 29:18.204
...let's be reasonable.

29:23.711 --> 29:25.611
You lost your mind?

29:27.315 --> 29:29.715
Little trick I learned
from Henry Winchester.

29:29.917 --> 29:31.441
He pulled the same stunt on me.

29:31.652 --> 29:34.519
I had a devil's trap carved
in the bullet.

29:35.890 --> 29:39.724
You're not seriously damaged,
just... powerless.

29:42.597 --> 29:44.656
I had nothing to do with it.

29:44.866 --> 29:48.461
I never would have agreed to meet
if I thought concealed assassins

29:48.669 --> 29:52.161
were going to try and attack you.
I hope you know that.

29:54.709 --> 29:56.404
Why are you telling me this?

29:56.611 --> 29:59.910
Even though you and I are on
opposite sides in this situation,

30:00.114 --> 30:03.606
I believe there must be honor,
even in matters of war.

30:03.818 --> 30:07.151
But what happened... doesn't it
prove my point about Metatron?

30:07.355 --> 30:09.823
You met with me in good faith,

30:09.991 --> 30:12.926
but he lied,
and he used you to get at me.

30:13.127 --> 30:14.127
Castiel...

30:14.328 --> 30:19.061
Just as poor judgment undid you
all those centuries ago,

30:19.267 --> 30:21.735
your mistaken trust in Metatron
will bring you down again.

30:21.936 --> 30:24.234
I gave him my word.

30:24.438 --> 30:27.373
Do you expect me
to come make war on him?

30:27.575 --> 30:29.167
No. Not at all.

30:29.377 --> 30:32.608
I want you to stay
right where you are.

30:34.248 --> 30:36.478
Just give me reports
on what Metatron is planning

30:36.651 --> 30:38.118
and when he will strike.

30:39.720 --> 30:41.688
And the honor we were speaking of?

30:41.889 --> 30:45.655
Obviously, Metatron has someone
inside my camp.

30:45.826 --> 30:47.384
It's how he knew we were meeting.

30:47.595 --> 30:50.758
Just fighting fire with fire.

30:51.899 --> 30:53.730
Consider my offer.

31:11.285 --> 31:13.845
All right. Let's do this.

31:14.055 --> 31:16.023
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a sec.

31:16.190 --> 31:18.784
We should give this place a
once-over before we go up there.

31:19.994 --> 31:21.325
Okay. Why?

31:21.529 --> 31:24.089
Crowley said he thought he saw some
demons headed down to the basement.

31:24.298 --> 31:25.618
He'd have checked it out himself,

31:25.766 --> 31:27.961
but if word got back to Abaddon
that he'd been seen...

31:29.136 --> 31:31.161
- When did he say all this?
- On the phone.

31:31.372 --> 31:32.930
Look, it might mean that
she knows that he's here, okay?

31:33.140 --> 31:34.334
So why don't you
check out the basement.

31:34.542 --> 31:36.442
I'll take a look on the main floor.

31:49.257 --> 31:50.690
Hello, Dean.

31:52.893 --> 31:55.191
Love the crazy bloodlust
in your eyes.

31:59.767 --> 32:02.235
Let's not waste time.

32:02.403 --> 32:04.064
I'll take you to Abaddon.

32:07.441 --> 32:08.533
It's not far.

32:20.254 --> 32:22.620
A boy and his blade.

32:22.823 --> 32:26.589
And still no match for the new queen.

32:44.278 --> 32:49.875
So, first... you'll die.

32:50.284 --> 32:51.342
Painfully.

32:51.952 --> 32:54.921
And then Crowley
will watch his son die.

32:56.957 --> 32:58.754
Ditto.

32:58.959 --> 33:01.086
And then the king himself.

33:01.295 --> 33:04.492
And Blade destroyed.

33:04.665 --> 33:06.496
That's quite a to-do list.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.571
Dean!

34:55.609 --> 34:57.372
Dean! Stop!

35:00.314 --> 35:01.713
You can stop.

35:28.008 --> 35:31.739
You could at least...
help me with this.

35:33.747 --> 35:35.544
We didn't kill you, Crowley,

35:35.749 --> 35:37.546
even though it would've
been very easy.

35:37.751 --> 35:39.343
Isn't that enough?

35:39.520 --> 35:40.953
You owe me.

35:41.155 --> 35:43.885
Do I get no credit
for warning you this was a trap?

35:45.192 --> 35:48.423
"Poughkeepsie" ring a bell?

35:56.103 --> 35:58.196
Oh, I sense drama.

36:00.875 --> 36:03.537
I just still can't get over
the fact that Crowley has a son.

36:03.744 --> 36:05.473
How's he doing, by the way?

36:05.980 --> 36:06.980
Ow!

36:08.782 --> 36:10.306
How do you think?

36:12.119 --> 36:14.053
You get that he's
got to go back, right?

36:14.255 --> 36:15.779
To his own time?

36:15.990 --> 36:21.121
If the lad goes back, his destiny is
to board a ship bound for America.

36:21.328 --> 36:24.559
That ship went down in a storm.
All hands were lost.

36:25.533 --> 36:29.025
He had one chance in this world
to change his life.

36:30.905 --> 36:32.668
You want that
to all end in tragedy?

36:34.675 --> 36:36.404
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

36:36.610 --> 36:38.043
Them's the rules. He goes back.

36:38.245 --> 36:40.770
The lore all says the same thing.

36:40.981 --> 36:43.973
You change any one thing in the past,

36:44.151 --> 36:46.813
the ripple effect impacts
everything that follows.

36:47.021 --> 36:48.613
Please.

36:48.822 --> 36:51.757
No one bends the rules like
you two bend the rules.

36:51.959 --> 36:54.723
He's one misfit kid.
He impacts no one.

36:54.929 --> 36:57.329
You don't bend that rule,
Okay? You don't.

36:57.531 --> 36:59.897
We'll take him back to the bunker,
figure out the spell.

37:00.100 --> 37:01.624
That's the way it's got to be.

37:03.003 --> 37:04.630
Can I at least say goodbye?

37:13.948 --> 37:18.976
I'll cheer the day when the last
trace of humanity leaves me.

37:19.153 --> 37:20.643
Feelings.

37:37.037 --> 37:38.766
Damn it, Crowley!

37:39.807 --> 37:41.570
The ship went down?

37:44.044 --> 37:46.638
Well, that's a good fit
with the rest of my life.

37:46.847 --> 37:49.338
Mustn't snivel, Gavin.

37:49.550 --> 37:53.145
It might fit the old life.
This one could be different.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.914
I don't know the first thing
about the 21st Century!

37:56.123 --> 37:57.647
You'll be fine.

37:57.858 --> 38:00.190
Just avoid cheap whiskey
and cheap hookers.

38:02.062 --> 38:04.997
Look at me, getting all fatherly.

38:06.934 --> 38:08.492
So this is goodbye, then?

38:08.702 --> 38:11.830
Yes. Forever.

38:13.273 --> 38:15.537
Unless, of course,
I catch you smoking,

38:15.676 --> 38:18.338
in which case, I'll smack you stupid.

38:21.849 --> 38:23.510
Goodbye, then.

38:23.717 --> 38:25.207
And thank you...

38:26.453 --> 38:28.546
...father.
Whoa, easy, easy.

38:28.756 --> 38:30.519
As you were.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.752
Goodbye, Gavin.

38:35.663 --> 38:36.663
Oh, uh...

38:37.665 --> 38:41.863
Don't go mentioning that
whole "Prince of Hell" thing.

38:42.069 --> 38:43.900
Doesn't play too well
in most circles.

38:53.580 --> 38:54.980
I didn't tell you about the warning

38:54.982 --> 38:56.813
because I knew exactly
what you would do.

38:57.017 --> 38:59.008
You would make sure that you were

38:59.219 --> 39:01.153
right alongside me
going in that room.

39:02.756 --> 39:04.587
You mean like we always do?

39:04.792 --> 39:06.312
Because we're actually
partners in this

39:06.393 --> 39:07.860
and we watch each other's backs?

39:08.062 --> 39:09.996
I don't expect you to understand.

39:10.197 --> 39:12.290
Try me.

39:19.373 --> 39:23.673
First time I touched that blade...
I knew.

39:23.877 --> 39:25.936
I knew that I wouldn't be stopped.

39:29.817 --> 39:35.414
I knew I would take down Abaddon
and anything else if I had to.

39:35.589 --> 39:37.079
And it wasn't a hero thing.

39:37.291 --> 39:39.259
You know, it wasn't...

39:41.395 --> 39:43.158
It was just calm.

39:45.899 --> 39:47.230
I knew.

39:48.502 --> 39:50.902
And I had to go it alone, Sammy.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.102
Oh. Of course.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.676
So it was just another time
where you had to protect me.

39:58.879 --> 40:00.608
You could've gotten nabbed
by Abaddon,

40:00.814 --> 40:03.305
and she could've
bargained her way out.

40:03.517 --> 40:05.678
We couldn't afford to screw this up.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.017
Look...

40:14.228 --> 40:16.196
I'm glad it worked out, okay?
I am.

40:16.396 --> 40:20.059
And I'm glad the Blade gives you
strength or calm or whatever,

40:20.234 --> 40:22.668
but, Dean, I got to say...

40:22.870 --> 40:25.634
...I'm starting to think the Blade
is doing something else, too.

40:26.874 --> 40:28.637
Yeah? Like what?

40:28.842 --> 40:32.005
I don't know.
Like, something to you.

40:34.348 --> 40:35.872
Look...

40:36.083 --> 40:40.918
I'm thinking until we know for sure
that we're gonna kill off Crowley,

40:41.121 --> 40:43.919
why don't we store the Blade
somewhere distant?

40:44.124 --> 40:45.955
Lock it up somewhere safe?

40:46.160 --> 40:47.160
Okay?

40:50.164 --> 40:51.563
No.
