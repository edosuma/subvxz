13:51.718 --> 13:54.220
[Dog Barking]

14:10.988 --> 14:14.073
[Man On Radio] There have been genetic
studies on beef cattle.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.409
There has been concern
the degree of heritability...

14:16.493 --> 14:19.078
of economically important traits
such as rate of growth...

14:19.162 --> 14:21.080
meat conversion
and carcass quality.

14:21.164 --> 14:25.376
Thin breeds,
and in many cases Herefords...

14:25.460 --> 14:28.671
they have been selected
for these traits.

14:28.755 --> 14:32.466
Findings have shown generally
that such traits are highly heritable.

14:32.551 --> 14:34.635
This is consistent
with similar studies...

14:34.720 --> 14:37.264
conducted elsewhere
around the country.

14:37.348 --> 14:40.100
On the other hand,
some other traits...

14:40.184 --> 14:42.269
such as fertility
and calf-survival rate-

14:42.353 --> 14:44.479
low inheritability.

14:45.690 --> 14:47.691
Heterosis,
or hybrid vigor...

14:47.775 --> 14:50.235
may be an important factor
in these latter traits...

14:50.320 --> 14:52.404
and the crossing
of genetic unlikes...

14:52.488 --> 14:55.991
produces heterosis
for best crossbreeding.

14:56.075 --> 14:59.119
So just a few views
of what's to come...
