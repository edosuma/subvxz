00:07.971 --> 00:10.060
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i> Runaways...

00:10.143 --> 00:12.147
Guys, there's an easy way
to get to the bottom of this.

00:12.231 --> 00:14.235
We do some P.I. work,
and we let cooler heads prevail.

00:14.318 --> 00:16.740
I would be happy to tell you
more about your mom and dad.

00:16.823 --> 00:18.619
- What's that?
- It was Amy's.

00:18.702 --> 00:20.748
I found it in my mom's desk.
She was hiding it.

00:20.831 --> 00:23.879
Did you see them? The lights, colors?

00:26.510 --> 00:28.179
Did you get into a fight at the party?

00:28.263 --> 00:30.058
Just some stupid lacrosse shit.

00:31.143 --> 00:33.147
Get away from her!

00:33.231 --> 00:34.818
So it wasn't about a girl?

00:34.901 --> 00:38.157
- No, no. I'll call you later.
- Okay.

00:38.241 --> 00:40.120
<i>You know we're gonna
have to tell the girls.</i>

00:40.203 --> 00:42.875
Oh, that we're moving to a
remote ranch in the Yucatan

00:42.959 --> 00:44.546
with our prehistoric guard dog?

00:48.386 --> 00:50.766
Mr. Dean, this area is off-limits.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.187
I can't even check it out?
Must be pretty nice,

00:53.271 --> 00:54.774
considering how much time
she's been spending in there.

00:54.858 --> 00:56.027
I don't understand.

00:56.110 --> 00:57.530
It's never taken this long before.

00:57.613 --> 00:58.949
<i>It must've been some kind</i>

00:59.033 --> 01:00.703
of Gibborim ceremony
for a higher level than me.

01:00.786 --> 01:02.957
<i>My mom seemed fine this morning.</i>

01:03.041 --> 01:05.755
She wouldn't have acted so normal if
she'd killed a parishioner last night.

01:05.838 --> 01:08.468
<i>If you know anything
about Destiny Gonzalez,</i>

01:08.552 --> 01:10.848
<i>you're being urged
to contact Detective Flores...</i>

01:10.931 --> 01:13.061

<i>Amy, please turn off your alarm.</i>

01:28.717 --> 01:32.391
<i>Amy, traffic is heavy on the 405.</i>

01:32.474 --> 01:34.436
<i>If you do not depart in 40 minutes,</i>

01:34.521 --> 01:37.527
<i>you will be late for school. Amy?</i>

01:46.085 --> 01:47.085
Mom!

01:53.224 --> 01:56.480
- Amy!
- No! No!

01:56.565 --> 01:58.986
Wait, what's happening?
I don't understand what...

02:00.321 --> 02:04.622
No! No, no, no, no!

02:04.706 --> 02:06.835
No, no!

02:06.918 --> 02:08.755
This isn't happening!

02:08.839 --> 02:10.258
Mom!

02:14.517 --> 02:16.813
- Wizey, call 911!
- Nico, no.

02:16.897 --> 02:18.984
Wizey, seal the house.

02:19.067 --> 02:21.446
<i>Sealing home, and...</i>

02:21.447 --> 02:22.456
<i>...perimeter.</i>

02:36.268 --> 02:39.066
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

02:39.149 --> 02:41.988
Hi. We need an ambulance at my house.

02:42.072 --> 02:45.913
Come quick, please. Um, the address...

03:07.707 --> 03:09.459
Does anyone else have keys?

03:09.544 --> 03:10.921
Not that I'm aware of.

03:11.005 --> 03:13.301
We just had them all changed
three weeks ago, too.

03:13.384 --> 03:15.430
Are there any entrances
I'm not aware of?

03:15.514 --> 03:18.604
Wizey, scan all windows and
doors for any known breaches.

03:18.687 --> 03:20.774
<i>Scanning house now.</i>

03:30.168 --> 03:32.715
Wizey, show me Tina's office.

03:32.798 --> 03:34.343
<i>I am sorry, Nico.</i>

03:34.426 --> 03:36.598
Shh! Wizey, voice off.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.648
Show me Tina's office.

03:40.731 --> 03:42.943
<i>Where's your husband?</i>

03:43.027 --> 03:45.281
<i>Robert? He knows you're here.</i>

03:54.884 --> 03:56.053
<i>I'll handle it.</i>

03:58.182 --> 03:59.936
Wizey, freeze.

04:01.313 --> 04:02.482
Zoom in.

04:07.868 --> 04:09.496
Live.

04:46.236 --> 04:47.948
<i>Incoming call.</i>

04:49.034 --> 04:50.537
<i>Incoming call.</i>

04:51.790 --> 04:53.250
<i>Incoming call.</i>

04:54.545 --> 04:55.839
<i>Incoming call.</i>

04:55.923 --> 04:56.925
Accept.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.431
- What are you doing?
<i>- Group WizTalk.</i>

05:00.516 --> 05:03.187
<i>- I think your mom invented it.</i>
- And why are we doing it?

05:03.270 --> 05:05.441
- <i>You haven't heard the news?</i>
- What news?

05:05.526 --> 05:06.954
<i>- You haven't heard yet?
- My God, about the beach?</i>

05:06.955 --> 05:08.280
<i>Have you been living
under a rock all night?</i>

05:08.364 --> 05:10.118
Yeah, that cleared nothing up.

05:11.142 --> 05:12.330
<i>They found her body. Destiny.</i>

05:14.961 --> 05:16.923
Gotta say I called it.

05:17.006 --> 05:18.760
- Nico, what...
<i>- It doesn't make any sense.</i>

05:18.844 --> 05:20.388
Yeah, none of it does.

05:20.471 --> 05:22.560
They found her body on the
beach, not in that weird box

05:22.643 --> 05:24.522
which we found
in Victor's garage, empty.

05:24.605 --> 05:26.024
Did you find anything
in your parents' lab?

05:26.108 --> 05:28.445
<i>- No, nothing at all.</i>
- Well, not nothing.

05:28.530 --> 05:30.534
Gert saw something.
You want to say what?

05:30.617 --> 05:32.872
<i>- Uh, no.</i>
- My junk.

05:32.955 --> 05:35.293
<i>She totally put on x-ray
goggles and checked me out.</i>

05:35.376 --> 05:37.088
<i>Can we stay on topic?</i>

05:37.172 --> 05:40.052
Okay, Wilder, what'd you find
in your basement murder library?

05:40.136 --> 05:41.446
<i>Okay, the word choice there</i>

05:41.470 --> 05:43.470
<i>implies that a murder
definitely happened.</i>

05:43.560 --> 05:45.564
I couldn't get in.
Dad wouldn't leave me alone.

05:45.647 --> 05:47.192
Oh, what, like he knew
you were suspicious?

05:47.275 --> 05:48.444
No, like he loves me

05:48.528 --> 05:49.906
and actually wants
to spend time with me.

05:49.989 --> 05:51.325
So, did our parents do it or not?

05:51.408 --> 05:53.495
Molly, that's what we're talking about.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.540
<i>That's the whole thing
we're trying to figure out.</i>

05:55.584 --> 05:57.796
Why are we even still debating this?

05:57.880 --> 06:00.844
I've been reading Amy's diary, okay,

06:00.928 --> 06:02.681
and I thought my mom hid it from me

06:02.765 --> 06:04.351
because of what was in it,

06:04.434 --> 06:06.394
but now I think it's because
of what wasn't in it.

06:07.566 --> 06:09.820
<i>Amy was happy.</i>

06:09.904 --> 06:12.158
There's no way she did what she did.

06:12.242 --> 06:15.791
<i>A girl dies on the same night after
the same meeting that Amy died.</i>

06:15.874 --> 06:17.878
<i>- Oh, my God, Nico.
- Nico, come on, are you crazy?</i>

06:17.962 --> 06:19.840
That's totally different.
We're their blood.

06:19.924 --> 06:21.511
Not all of us, technically.

06:21.594 --> 06:23.138
<i>Yeah, sorry, Nico,
strangers are one thing...</i>

06:23.222 --> 06:25.184
Destiny wasn't a stranger
to Karolina's mom.

06:25.268 --> 06:27.021
Which is why I don't believe
that she would hurt her.

06:27.105 --> 06:28.817
And my parents wouldn't hurt Amy.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.460
<i>Like your parents are better than ours?</i>

06:30.486 --> 06:32.866
You father was actually
in prison for murder.

06:32.950 --> 06:34.912
A long time ago,
and the charges were dropped.

06:34.996 --> 06:36.708
<i>The murder library's in your basement.</i>

06:36.791 --> 06:38.294
<i>Can we please stop calling it that?</i>

06:38.377 --> 06:39.755
<i>Can we stop turning on each other?</i>

06:39.839 --> 06:41.559
Okay, all I'm saying is
we need to be smart.

06:41.634 --> 06:44.139
<i>First time for that, huh, Chase?</i>

06:44.222 --> 06:45.559
We need to protect ourselves.

06:45.642 --> 06:48.397
No, you don't. I could be your muscle.
I-I could show you...

06:48.480 --> 06:50.109
<i>I'm so sorry about her.</i>

06:50.192 --> 06:52.447
Although it only works when I'm scared.

06:52.531 --> 06:54.492
Are you not scared? Because I am.

06:54.577 --> 06:58.710
Look, you can all believe in
whatever fantasy you want, but...

06:58.793 --> 07:01.214
I'm gonna make damn sure
that they can't hurt me.

07:01.298 --> 07:03.887
<i>I suggest you all do the same.</i>

07:03.970 --> 07:05.807
<i>Call terminated by host.</i>

10:26.959 --> 10:28.796
Help!

10:28.880 --> 10:31.677
Help! Help!

10:31.761 --> 10:33.388
Help me!

10:33.472 --> 10:36.645
Help me! Please help me!

10:36.729 --> 10:39.066
Help! Somebody help me!

10:42.323 --> 10:44.327
Help!

10:44.410 --> 10:46.039
Somebody help me!

10:46.122 --> 10:47.458
Help!

10:47.542 --> 10:49.588
We always knew that this could happen.

10:49.671 --> 10:52.092
That is why we put
a tracking device on her.

10:52.176 --> 10:53.638
Yeah, which you never turned on.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.892
The tracking device is for tracking,

10:55.975 --> 10:57.394
for when she's on the move,

10:57.478 --> 10:59.440
not when she's safely ensconced
in her habitat.

10:59.525 --> 11:02.238
Yeah, where she would still be if
you hadn't left the door unlocked.

11:02.321 --> 11:03.574
Why is it always me who
left the door unlocked?

11:03.658 --> 11:05.160
Maybe you left the door
unlocked for once.

11:05.244 --> 11:08.333
Okay, I always lock the door.
You know I have a system.

11:08.416 --> 11:11.256
All right, all right, look...

11:11.339 --> 11:13.928
however she got out,
we need to find her.

11:14.011 --> 11:15.974
- Yeah.
- Fast.

11:16.057 --> 11:18.478
- Find who?
- Oh, hey, sweetie!

11:19.648 --> 11:23.488
Someone is missing from the lab.

11:23.573 --> 11:25.117
Yeah, a hedgehog.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.706
A, uh... very rare, valuable hedgehog,

11:27.789 --> 11:31.129
and I... well, actually we...

11:31.212 --> 11:34.887
are gonna take
this drone out and find it.

11:34.970 --> 11:36.849
I don't remember a hedgehog.

11:36.932 --> 11:39.437
I was down there the other
night feeding everyone.

11:39.521 --> 11:42.944
Definitely no hedgehog. Monster!

11:43.028 --> 11:47.996
Well, I guess that means it has
been gone longer than we thought.

11:48.079 --> 11:51.712
Um, you know, maybe we'll just get
something to eat while we're out.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.381
- Okay.
- Bye, girls.

11:53.465 --> 11:54.467
Good luck.

11:56.764 --> 11:59.352
- Those two are the worst liars ever.
- Pretty much.

12:03.485 --> 12:06.491
- Hoo! That was a close call.
- I know.

12:06.575 --> 12:07.577
You think they suspected anything?

12:07.661 --> 12:09.915
No, we're smooth operators.

12:11.209 --> 12:13.839
Oh, it's PRIDE. Emergency meeting.

12:13.923 --> 12:16.595
- Now?
- No! No more!

12:16.679 --> 12:18.181
PRIDE can suck it.

12:18.264 --> 12:19.893
This is too important.
This is about our future.

12:19.977 --> 12:21.647
Testify, Mama Bear.

12:21.730 --> 12:24.569
Now, how hard can it be to find
a dinosaur in the Palisades?

12:24.653 --> 12:25.947
Right?

12:27.449 --> 12:29.161
I hope this works.

12:29.245 --> 12:33.253
Yeah, well, this guy look
like someone you can trust?

12:35.132 --> 12:36.259
Is everyone here?

12:36.342 --> 12:39.265
No. We're winging this shit, man.

12:39.348 --> 12:41.603
Since you called out the blue side,
everything's all patched up.

12:41.687 --> 12:43.231
You have a right to be angry, I know,

12:43.314 --> 12:45.778
but I said I was gonna make
it up to you all, and I am.

12:45.862 --> 12:48.199
The solution is right...

12:51.749 --> 12:53.586
Where is she? You said you had someone.

12:53.669 --> 12:56.759
I did. I hit her with a tire
iron and tied her up in here.

13:04.065 --> 13:05.777
She was eating French fries.

13:22.351 --> 13:23.813
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

13:26.819 --> 13:30.200
I didn't want to say anything
on the phone last night,

13:30.283 --> 13:32.079
but after reading Amy's diary...

13:33.791 --> 13:36.379
She didn't do it, Alex.

13:36.462 --> 13:39.093
I know she didn't.

13:39.176 --> 13:42.725
I'm going to the police after school.
Come with me?

13:42.809 --> 13:45.272
The police? No way.

13:45.355 --> 13:47.109
Nico, what are you even going to say?

13:47.192 --> 13:49.154
That the most prominent
families in the city,

13:49.238 --> 13:51.075
dressed in matching nightgowns,

13:51.158 --> 13:53.789
put a girl in a glowing box that
you're pretty sure killed her?

13:53.873 --> 13:55.626
There are six witnesses...

14:00.887 --> 14:02.389
...and a dead body.

14:02.472 --> 14:04.561
Two dead bodies.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.397
And then what?

14:06.480 --> 14:10.488
Our parents lie for each other,
or say nothing and demand proof.

14:10.573 --> 14:13.662
They have the world's greatest
lawyer, my mom, not to mention,

14:13.746 --> 14:16.083
who do you think they're going
to suspect turned them in?

14:16.167 --> 14:18.756
The only other people
at the house that night... us.

14:21.302 --> 14:23.056
So I take it that's a no?

14:27.314 --> 14:29.569
If the police don't believe me,
that's on them,

14:29.653 --> 14:31.573
but I'm telling them everything I know,

14:31.657 --> 14:35.246
about Destiny and my sister.

14:39.923 --> 14:42.637
- We are in trouble here, Victor.
- I know. I know I screwed up.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.808
First the girl,
and now this false alarm?

14:44.891 --> 14:46.477
What is going on with you?

14:46.561 --> 14:48.607
The side effects from malaria medicine,

14:48.691 --> 14:50.736
I think, from my trip to South Africa.

14:50.820 --> 14:53.199
Why not just tell us
the box wasn't working?

14:53.282 --> 14:56.455
He wanted to, but I
talked him out of it.

14:56.540 --> 14:57.917
I was sure that he fixed it.

14:58.001 --> 15:00.422
It wasn't the box. It was me.

15:00.506 --> 15:02.593
But I'm feeling much better now.

15:02.677 --> 15:03.804
You sure about that?

15:07.979 --> 15:10.275
I got my people covering
on the girl's body.

15:10.358 --> 15:12.279
We'll be okay on that front, but...

15:12.362 --> 15:14.116
We have a larger problem.

15:16.245 --> 15:17.957
He's sicker than he's ever been.

15:18.041 --> 15:20.546
We need a replacement, now.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.842
Someone else from the church?

15:22.925 --> 15:25.514
Two kids in the same week?
It'll draw attention.

15:25.598 --> 15:27.852
I think Victor had the right idea.

15:27.935 --> 15:30.315
We need a homeless person
or a prostitute.

15:30.398 --> 15:32.987
You mean someone who doesn't count.

15:33.071 --> 15:35.576
They all count.

15:35.659 --> 15:37.329
You think this isn't hard for me?

15:37.412 --> 15:40.836
Would you let me take care of this?
It was my screw-up.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.550
You are right about that,
but you're not going alone.

15:44.761 --> 15:46.263
Robert?

15:48.309 --> 15:50.021
My plate's a bit full today.

15:50.105 --> 15:51.858
Clear it.

15:53.695 --> 15:56.660
I see Dale and Stacey
chose not to attend today.

15:56.743 --> 15:59.248
I think it might be a good idea
for us all to take some time

15:59.331 --> 16:01.628
to consider the promise we made
all those years ago.

16:03.214 --> 16:05.678
I'll make sure they do just that.

16:05.761 --> 16:07.890
I have to get back to him.

16:07.974 --> 16:09.936
He can't be alone right now.

16:16.575 --> 16:17.869
Hey, Chase!

16:20.290 --> 16:22.127
Tried to get your attention in homeroom.

16:22.210 --> 16:23.547
Guess you didn't notice me.

16:23.630 --> 16:25.551
No, I saw. I just pretended I didn't.

16:25.634 --> 16:29.099
I thought it'd be weird, you know,
talking like we're friends.

16:29.183 --> 16:32.857
After everything that's happened,
that's what you think is weird, okay.

16:32.940 --> 16:37.783
Um, well, I just wanted to say thank you
for not telling anyone about the lab.

16:37.867 --> 16:39.954
Yeah, figured it wasn't my place.

16:40.038 --> 16:41.290
Why keep it a secret?

16:41.373 --> 16:42.793
I don't know,

16:42.877 --> 16:45.256
I don't really want
my parents to get in trouble

16:45.340 --> 16:47.803
with FEMA or the ASPCA.

16:47.887 --> 16:52.020
They must've genetically
scripted that therapod, so...

16:52.103 --> 16:53.607
must be all kinds of illegal.

16:53.690 --> 16:55.778
Yeah, so is killing a girl.

16:55.861 --> 16:57.657
There he is right there.

17:02.792 --> 17:05.756
All weekend, no apology?

17:05.839 --> 17:07.425
You're not getting one now, either.

17:07.510 --> 17:09.054
Come on, man, it was just a party.

17:09.137 --> 17:10.766
Everyone's wasted, shit happens.

17:10.848 --> 17:12.895
All that matters is the team.

17:12.979 --> 17:15.693
We gotta be able to put
stuff like this behind us.

17:15.776 --> 17:18.030
"Stuff like this"?

17:18.114 --> 17:20.076
You can't even say
what you were gonna do.

17:20.159 --> 17:22.623
Look, man, State is almost here.

17:22.707 --> 17:25.377
Just say you're sorry
and we all move on.

17:28.425 --> 17:29.887
You gonna say sorry to her?

17:29.971 --> 17:34.146
No. I got a broken rib
'cause of that bitch.

17:35.524 --> 17:37.277
Well, good thing you got 23 more!

17:37.360 --> 17:38.614
Chase!

17:41.870 --> 17:43.707
- Hey, hey, hey, stop it!
- Get off me!

17:43.790 --> 17:44.876
That's enough, stop!

17:44.959 --> 17:46.170
- Stop it, Chase!
- That's enough!

17:46.253 --> 17:48.842
- Get off of me!
- That's enough, stop!

17:48.925 --> 17:51.598
Three of you, in my office now.

17:51.681 --> 17:52.850
Let's go, gentlemen.

17:55.939 --> 17:57.067
Come on, everyone, let's go.
Break it up.

17:57.150 --> 17:58.486
Back to lunch. Nothing to see.

17:58.570 --> 18:00.532
This is all your fault.

18:00.616 --> 18:01.660
What is?

18:01.743 --> 18:03.329
Well, if you didn't get wasted

18:03.412 --> 18:05.793
and hook up with Brandon
and Lucas at that party,

18:05.876 --> 18:08.089
then Chase wouldn't have
gone ham on their asses,

18:08.172 --> 18:10.803
and our state lacrosse title
wouldn't be in jeopardy.

18:10.886 --> 18:13.391
No, that... that... that never happened.

18:13.474 --> 18:16.146
Yeah, it did,
but you wouldn't remember that,

18:16.230 --> 18:18.067
because you're a lightweight drunk

18:18.150 --> 18:21.281
and a lacrosse-ruining slut.

18:30.341 --> 18:33.598
I have no idea what she's
talking about. I...

18:33.682 --> 18:36.688
I was... I was dancing alone downstairs,

18:36.771 --> 18:40.319
and then the next thing I knew,
I woke up with Chase.

18:40.403 --> 18:42.908
Karolina, it sounds
like maybe those guys...

18:42.992 --> 18:45.455
No, no! She's lying. I would know!

18:47.292 --> 18:49.756
I'm... I mean, I would know, right?

18:50.924 --> 18:52.595
Yeah.

18:54.055 --> 18:55.475
Why wouldn't Chase tell me?

18:55.559 --> 18:58.355
I think he's trying to protect you.

19:04.409 --> 19:06.121
The light of the stars...

19:07.541 --> 19:09.461
The warmth of the sun...

19:10.631 --> 19:12.050
The energy of the universe.

19:12.133 --> 19:13.762
Stop.

19:13.845 --> 19:16.225
I can't.

19:16.308 --> 19:18.563
There must be something that I can do.

19:18.647 --> 19:20.233
Just tell me.

19:20.316 --> 19:22.822
Warm me.

20:30.540 --> 20:32.586
I had a feeling I'd find you here.

20:32.670 --> 20:35.216
This is a sacred space, Frank.

20:35.299 --> 20:39.391
This is our church, last I checked.

20:39.474 --> 20:43.232
I haven't seen you in days,
so what's going on in there?

20:43.315 --> 20:46.446
It's called a meditation room.
It's pretty self-explanatory.

20:46.531 --> 20:48.158
Leslie, are you having an affair?

20:51.164 --> 20:53.712
That's your fear, isn't it?

20:53.795 --> 20:55.841
You think the threat to our union

20:55.924 --> 21:00.224
is lust and temptation of the flesh?

21:00.307 --> 21:03.188
It's a pretty normal married-guy fear.

21:03.272 --> 21:05.026
What am I supposed to think?

21:05.109 --> 21:07.781
It's not your fault that your
worldview is so limited.

21:07.865 --> 21:09.869
All of that is about to change.

21:09.952 --> 21:12.248
I've made arrangements
for you at the Crater.

21:12.331 --> 21:16.674
- What?
- I sense that you're ready...

21:18.010 --> 21:20.515
to go Ultra.

21:20.599 --> 21:22.561
That's what I've been doing in there...

21:22.644 --> 21:26.611
praying for you over the last two days.

21:26.694 --> 21:28.363
And I've made my decision.

21:28.447 --> 21:33.415
And I just accused you of...
Insecure actor.

21:35.962 --> 21:39.595
You'll have to cleanse yourself
of that if you want to join me...

21:40.764 --> 21:42.475
but I think you can.

21:56.754 --> 21:59.342
They're expecting you tonight.

21:59.425 --> 22:01.471
I don't know what to say.

22:02.933 --> 22:04.477
Thank you.

22:07.526 --> 22:11.241
Don't thank me.
You did this all on your own.

22:18.673 --> 22:21.512
It's always the church
girls that are the craziest.

22:23.182 --> 22:25.186
What's wrong with this chick?!

22:36.792 --> 22:39.464
Stein, team meeting happening about you.

22:39.548 --> 22:40.800
Sorry, Coach.

22:40.884 --> 22:43.890
Inspirational speech time, gentlemen.

22:43.973 --> 22:46.687
You guys have worked your ass
off every day to get here.

22:46.771 --> 22:50.904
You got college recruiters
around the country after you.

22:50.987 --> 22:54.662
Whatever's come between you guys,
it can't be worth risking all that.

22:56.248 --> 22:57.291
Right?

23:04.430 --> 23:06.644
Hello, Gert, reporting for duty.

23:06.727 --> 23:09.650
Hi. Okay. What are we talking about?

23:09.733 --> 23:11.904
Your club. Undermining the Patriarchy.

23:11.988 --> 23:13.950
It says the first meeting is today.

23:14.033 --> 23:15.620
We made T-shirts!

23:15.704 --> 23:18.710
This shirt no longer fills me
with unspeakable sadness.

23:18.793 --> 23:23.135
Oh, my God, my club.
I totally forgot about this.

23:23.218 --> 23:25.807
I feel like I passed
these out a lifetime ago.

23:25.890 --> 23:27.769
I think it was Friday.

23:27.853 --> 23:29.940
Hey, Gert, can I talk
to you for a second?

23:30.024 --> 23:32.403
Sorry, blondie, members only.

23:37.038 --> 23:39.083
I'm so sorry, fellow travelers,

23:39.167 --> 23:42.173
but the patriarchy is going to
have to remain for another day.

23:42.256 --> 23:43.676
Hey, Karolina!

24:03.173 --> 24:05.260
I'm just surprised
you wanted me to help.

24:05.344 --> 24:06.639
With everything going on right now,

24:06.722 --> 24:08.433
proving that our parents are innocent

24:08.518 --> 24:10.814
is the one thing that would
actually make me feel better.

24:10.897 --> 24:13.151
You're the only other person
who thinks they might be.

24:13.235 --> 24:15.280
Not that I'm incapable
of doing it on my own...

24:15.364 --> 24:16.742
I do most things on my own.

24:16.826 --> 24:18.245
No, this is better, though.

24:19.372 --> 24:21.042
Sisterhood is powerful, right?

24:23.422 --> 24:26.177
Hey, Alex, do you want to come with us?

24:26.261 --> 24:28.181
You two are going somewhere?

24:28.265 --> 24:29.977
- Together?
- My house.

24:30.060 --> 24:31.522
Yeah, we're bonding

24:31.605 --> 24:33.985
on a mission to prove
our parents aren't killers.

24:34.068 --> 24:36.156
And how's that?

24:36.239 --> 24:39.788
As I was telling Gert, there's a Gibborim
ceremony when somebody goes Ultra.

24:39.872 --> 24:41.542
I haven't seen it,
it's a higher level than me,

24:41.625 --> 24:43.546
but maybe that's what we saw.

24:43.629 --> 24:45.717
My mom has a bunch
of my grandpa's old papers

24:45.800 --> 24:47.219
and books on our rites and rituals.

24:47.303 --> 24:48.931
Could explain it.

24:49.015 --> 24:50.810
Except the rest of our parents
aren't in your church.

24:50.894 --> 24:52.396
There's clearly a lot
we don't know about the 'rents,

24:52.480 --> 24:54.693
but wouldn't it be great
if their big secret was

24:54.776 --> 24:56.947
just that they'd converted to Gibborim?

24:57.031 --> 25:00.162
Everyone can live without Dale
and Stacey's Passover brisket.

25:00.245 --> 25:02.416
Actually, Gibborim practitioners
can still observe

25:02.500 --> 25:04.462
any other aspect of other religions.

25:04.505 --> 25:06.884
- It's really inclusive in that way.
- Even better!

25:06.967 --> 25:09.055
You guys really want this?

25:09.138 --> 25:10.432
Are you with us?

25:10.517 --> 25:13.021
Team There's Gotta Be
Another Explanation?

25:13.104 --> 25:15.818
Yeah, honestly, I don't know
what I believe right now...

25:18.156 --> 25:20.035
but at least you two have each other,

25:20.118 --> 25:22.206
from someone who doesn't
have anyone in their corner.

25:22.289 --> 25:23.289
I gotta go.

25:35.190 --> 25:37.361
What's that smell?

25:37.444 --> 25:39.950
The smell of failure.

25:40.033 --> 25:41.996
Pick one, and let's get out of here.

25:49.553 --> 25:50.722
Yeah?

25:58.236 --> 25:59.781
Okay.

25:59.865 --> 26:02.494
All right, let's wheel him to the car.

26:02.579 --> 26:06.461
No, no, no, we gotta hit him
first so he doesn't wake up.

26:06.545 --> 26:07.922
The man's passed out!

26:09.425 --> 26:11.262
He's probably been passed out for days.

26:11.346 --> 26:14.561
He would shit his pants.
I can't take that chance.

26:14.645 --> 26:18.276
That doesn't seem like the most accurate
indicator for whether or not he's...

26:18.360 --> 26:19.696
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

26:19.780 --> 26:21.032
Finishing what I started.

26:24.330 --> 26:27.671
Robert, slice his Achilles tendon!
Disable him!

26:27.754 --> 26:30.510
- Are you insane?
- You ain't slicing shit, mother...!

26:37.189 --> 26:38.734
Your wife is going to kill us.

26:38.818 --> 26:41.155
My wife is never going to know.

26:41.239 --> 26:43.284
I'm calling Flores.

26:43.368 --> 26:47.711
I got a 1010 in progress on
Fifth and Spring. Requesting backup.

26:52.637 --> 26:55.142
You know, I'm really digging
this Gibb thing.

26:55.225 --> 26:58.524
I mean, I'm not super down with the
amount of white jeans involved,

26:58.607 --> 27:01.864
but there's a lot about this
that's really beautiful.

27:01.947 --> 27:04.911
Thank you. I know how it looks
to the outside world,

27:04.995 --> 27:09.170
but the more others doubt it, the more
it's always just reinforced my beliefs.

27:09.253 --> 27:12.217
Well, I apologize
for ever referring to it

27:12.301 --> 27:14.973
as a quasi-sci-fi crackpot pseudo cult.

27:17.144 --> 27:19.858
You know, the other kids think we're
crazy for believing in our parents.

27:19.941 --> 27:20.941
That's called faith.

27:25.368 --> 27:28.208
That's weird. My mom's laptop.

27:28.291 --> 27:29.711
She usually has it with her,

27:29.794 --> 27:32.216
but she has been kind
of distracted lately.

27:32.299 --> 27:35.681
Ultra... hey, maybe that's
what we're looking for.

27:37.059 --> 27:39.271
The file's encrypted.

27:42.194 --> 27:48.331
Hey! Do you remember Alex's
sixth-grade party favors?

27:48.414 --> 27:50.670
Well, the gift that keeps on giving.

27:53.424 --> 27:55.513
I'm sure Alex can figure this out.

27:55.596 --> 27:57.767
Ooh, that could be my mom.

28:05.115 --> 28:06.577
- Chase.
- Karolina.

28:07.912 --> 28:09.541
...and Gert.

28:10.793 --> 28:11.878
What are you doing here?

28:11.962 --> 28:13.632
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

28:13.716 --> 28:16.805
- It's kind of a long story.
- That's, uh...

28:16.888 --> 28:18.391
great.

28:20.020 --> 28:21.147
Um...

28:21.230 --> 28:23.067
Hey, can we talk?

28:24.361 --> 28:25.363
Alone?

28:26.700 --> 28:28.119
Of course, yeah.

28:28.202 --> 28:30.332
I have to go get this
to Alex, so I'll be going.

28:30.415 --> 28:31.627
Oh, hey, Gert...

28:31.710 --> 28:34.633
Thank you for being there for me.

28:34.716 --> 28:36.553
It's nice to know
I have you as a friend.

28:38.139 --> 28:39.643
Of course. Yeah.

28:39.726 --> 28:41.938
I... I'm everyone's friend.

28:42.022 --> 28:43.316
Yeah. Bye.

28:46.489 --> 28:48.952
I'll wait for my Lyft
out here, thank you!

29:09.326 --> 29:12.082
You come here to try
and talk me out of this?

29:12.165 --> 29:14.044
No, I know better than that.

29:14.128 --> 29:17.510
I came here so that you
wouldn't have to do this alone.

29:31.997 --> 29:33.792
Help you?

29:33.876 --> 29:35.713
I'd like to report a murder.

29:35.796 --> 29:38.050
I mean, I wouldn't <i>like</i> to, but...

29:38.134 --> 29:39.596
Is that right?

29:39.679 --> 29:42.392
No. It's two murders.

29:53.624 --> 29:55.586
- You quit?
- Yeah. Whatever.

29:55.669 --> 29:57.464
But lacrosse meant everything to you.

29:57.548 --> 29:59.051
Yeah, it did, but...

29:59.134 --> 30:03.267
there might be other things
that are more important.

30:03.351 --> 30:07.652
Chase, I don't even remember Brandon
and Lucas being at that party...

30:07.735 --> 30:10.908
but if they were and something
happened, I need you to tell me.

30:10.991 --> 30:12.620
Please, okay, I can handle it,

30:12.703 --> 30:14.958
but not knowing is, like, way worse.

30:17.128 --> 30:18.507
You don't have to worry.

30:20.426 --> 30:23.642
I... I walked in
before anything happened...

30:24.978 --> 30:28.735
but just before.

30:29.821 --> 30:32.158
Thank you.

30:32.242 --> 30:34.998
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, you don't have to be sorry.

30:36.458 --> 30:38.755
What I saw in them,
I can't be a part of.

30:38.797 --> 30:42.638
And, hey, maybe I'm replacing
lacrosse with something better.

30:47.940 --> 30:48.942
Come inside.

30:55.956 --> 30:58.169
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

31:08.147 --> 31:10.068
Something else happened that night,

31:10.151 --> 31:12.698
something that I can't explain,

31:12.782 --> 31:15.537
and I think I can make it happen again,

31:15.621 --> 31:17.792
but I've been too scared to try.

31:17.875 --> 31:20.881
So if I pass out again,

31:20.965 --> 31:23.219
I need you to help me, okay?

31:23.302 --> 31:25.056
- Just like you did.
- Wait...

31:26.601 --> 31:28.104
What's going on?

31:28.187 --> 31:29.481
Just stand there.

31:33.239 --> 31:34.826
I'm gonna take off my bracelet.

31:37.163 --> 31:38.165
Your bracelet.

31:52.528 --> 31:53.613
How do you do that?

31:53.697 --> 31:55.116
I don't know how!

31:55.199 --> 31:57.078
I don't even know what...

32:00.501 --> 32:02.005
What does it feel like?

32:03.842 --> 32:07.098
Good. Warm.

32:10.522 --> 32:13.945
- I'm kind of afraid.
- Of what?

32:14.029 --> 32:16.450
Electrocution? Radiation poisoning?

32:19.372 --> 32:20.500
I think it's okay.

32:36.490 --> 32:38.119
I have so many questions.

32:39.496 --> 32:40.624
Me too.

32:48.765 --> 32:50.686
What's taking so long?

32:50.769 --> 32:51.980
You getting cold feet?

32:52.063 --> 32:53.859
Oh, hey. Sorry for the wait.

32:53.942 --> 32:57.157
Detective on the Gonzales case
got an important call, so...

32:57.240 --> 32:58.994
We're good.

33:03.419 --> 33:06.049
Let's go. Let's go.

33:06.133 --> 33:07.302
Wait, why?

33:08.597 --> 33:09.849
Whoa...

33:09.932 --> 33:12.646
What is Chase's dad doing with your dad

33:12.730 --> 33:14.107
at the police station?

33:17.030 --> 33:18.533
Holy shit. Go, go, go, go.

33:30.056 --> 33:34.397
That detective is the man
my parents called when Amy died.

33:35.483 --> 33:36.611
He came to the house.

33:37.738 --> 33:39.324
He said he'd handle it.

33:39.407 --> 33:41.913
And now he's in charge
of Destiny's case.

33:44.292 --> 33:46.171
Your parents...

33:46.255 --> 33:49.177
Our parents have the cops
in their pocket.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.181
This has gotten too big.

33:52.267 --> 33:53.477
You believe me now?

33:55.106 --> 33:56.818
I think I always believed you.

34:03.289 --> 34:05.126
That's why I took this.

34:07.213 --> 34:09.301
Jesus, Alex!

34:09.384 --> 34:11.388
I found it in my dad's desk.

34:11.471 --> 34:13.391
And what do you think's going to
happen when he notices it's gone?

34:13.475 --> 34:15.981
I don't know. But Chase was right.

34:17.275 --> 34:18.862
We've gotta protect ourselves.

34:24.039 --> 34:26.083
Thank you for meeting me at home.

34:26.168 --> 34:30.301
As I'm sure you're aware, this
isn't exactly official business.

34:30.384 --> 34:32.723
Your house calls are
my favorite part of the job.

34:34.935 --> 34:36.731
You find what I was looking for?

34:36.813 --> 34:39.444
I did. Paints a pretty clear picture.

34:39.527 --> 34:42.116
Those bastards.

34:42.199 --> 34:44.329
It's none of my business, of course...

34:44.411 --> 34:45.540
Sure isn't.

34:45.623 --> 34:47.503
...but I was expecting something else...

34:47.585 --> 34:50.341
economic espionage, trade secret theft,

34:50.424 --> 34:51.594
but not this.

34:51.677 --> 34:54.474
To be honest, once I
put it all together,

34:54.558 --> 34:57.397
huh, kind of wanted to go with them.

35:02.156 --> 35:03.868
As always, Kincaid...

35:06.164 --> 35:07.668
thank you for your service.

35:07.751 --> 35:10.882
As always, Tina,
thank you for your money.

35:12.511 --> 35:13.805
You know...

35:15.307 --> 35:17.186
they don't seem like bad people.

35:19.315 --> 35:20.861
They never do.

35:29.879 --> 35:35.807
Temescal was a bust,
but I say we head northwest,

35:35.891 --> 35:37.185
Paramount Ranch.

35:38.980 --> 35:41.569
Let's face it, she's gone.

35:41.652 --> 35:43.405
I say we go, too.

35:43.489 --> 35:44.825
What do you mean?

35:44.909 --> 35:48.040
Go home? No. No way,
we are not giving up yet.

35:48.123 --> 35:50.504
No, not home. I say we go away.

35:50.587 --> 35:51.839
Without her?

35:53.217 --> 35:56.473
Stace, someone is going to find her.

35:56.557 --> 35:58.101
And then what?

35:58.185 --> 36:00.272
Well, then it'll become
the stuff of urban legend,

36:00.356 --> 36:02.151
like alligators
in the sewers of New York.

36:02.235 --> 36:05.659
Or it becomes the biggest thing
in the history of biogenetics.

36:05.742 --> 36:07.704
- And we don't get the credit.
- Or the blame.

36:07.788 --> 36:09.332
I can't do this anymore.

36:09.415 --> 36:11.336
I'm tired. I'm scared.

36:12.380 --> 36:13.883
And I'm done.

36:13.967 --> 36:15.052
What about the girls?

36:15.135 --> 36:16.722
Hmm?

36:16.806 --> 36:19.394
The sale of the serum
hasn't gone through yet.

36:19.477 --> 36:20.605
We have enough money.

36:22.191 --> 36:24.822
It was a good plan,
but the plan is screwed.

36:24.905 --> 36:26.032
Look at us!

36:27.159 --> 36:29.247
We go home, we pack, we leave,

36:29.330 --> 36:31.544
and no one ever hears
from the Yorkeses again.

36:39.935 --> 36:42.774
So maybe the bracelet
is some kind of inhibitor?

36:42.858 --> 36:45.864
Which would explain why my mom
never wanted me to take it off.

36:45.947 --> 36:49.037
Do you think there are other
people in your church who... glow?

36:49.120 --> 36:52.209
I don't know. I really, really
just gotta talk to my mom.

36:52.293 --> 36:54.047
Well, are you sure you can trust her?

36:54.130 --> 36:57.303
Yeah. Chase, I take this thing off
and I turn into Rainbow Brite.

36:57.386 --> 36:59.229
I mean, with all the weirdness going on...

36:59.253 --> 37:01.955
Hey. It's not weird.

37:03.231 --> 37:04.359
You are a...

37:05.737 --> 37:06.737
You are...

37:09.077 --> 37:11.039
the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

37:13.753 --> 37:15.381
You deserve answers.

37:53.248 --> 37:54.292
Gert?

38:02.851 --> 38:03.853
Gert?

38:06.441 --> 38:07.569
Are you home?

38:13.998 --> 38:16.504
You better not be trying
to scare me, Gertrude.

38:19.383 --> 38:21.514
This isn't funny!

38:28.569 --> 38:29.905
Ah-hah!

38:44.016 --> 38:45.018
Aah!

39:11.070 --> 39:12.991
Stop!

39:19.462 --> 39:20.798
Get away from her.

39:30.568 --> 39:31.820
Be still.

39:33.198 --> 39:35.870
Holy shit, it does what I say.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.590
Here.

39:43.594 --> 39:45.138
Sit.

39:52.486 --> 39:53.990
No way.

40:08.184 --> 40:10.523
You know, hon,
I think my passport expired.

40:10.606 --> 40:12.819
Yeah? We'll take care of... that.

40:12.902 --> 40:16.577
I guess we found the dinosaur.

40:22.839 --> 40:28.141
We... have... a dinosaur!

40:28.224 --> 40:29.770
When were you gonna tell us this?

40:29.853 --> 40:31.105
Well, there's a, um,

40:31.189 --> 40:32.859
a time and place for that kind of stuff.

40:32.942 --> 40:34.654
I'm available now.

40:34.738 --> 40:37.284
Can we start with why this
dinosaur listens to me like a dog?

40:37.368 --> 40:38.871
What do you mean?

40:38.954 --> 40:41.376
It only listens to her
and it doesn't listen to me.

40:41.459 --> 40:45.050
- Okay, that's...
- ...unexpected.

40:45.133 --> 40:49.308
We created it for your protection...
for our protection.

40:49.392 --> 40:50.392
Protection?

40:52.272 --> 40:53.901
Protection from what?

40:53.984 --> 40:55.320
Uh...

40:55.404 --> 40:57.449
Look, this might be
difficult for you to hear,

40:57.534 --> 40:59.996
but I just want you both
to know that everything we do,

41:00.080 --> 41:02.919
we do it for you girls.

41:03.002 --> 41:05.382
Everything. And...

41:05.465 --> 41:07.971
what I'm about to tell you
you may not understand

41:08.054 --> 41:11.603
right this moment,
but I promise you, one day,

41:11.687 --> 41:14.609
you will. It's just...

41:16.864 --> 41:19.995
I'll explain more to you
in the car on the way.

41:23.376 --> 41:25.840
Ignore it. This is more important.

41:25.923 --> 41:27.969
Um, okay,

41:28.052 --> 41:30.015
- what we're trying to say...
- It's Tina.

41:30.098 --> 41:32.186
Were you expecting her?

41:32.269 --> 41:34.273
What's going on?

41:34.356 --> 41:37.989
Uh, nothing. Just stay here
and keep her quiet.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.671
It's a "her"!

41:47.634 --> 41:51.349
It's not like you two to
miss an emergency PRIDE meeting.

41:51.432 --> 41:55.650
Oh! We are so sorry about that.
Wanted to come.

41:55.733 --> 41:57.987
Mushroom hunting in the cave.

41:58.071 --> 42:00.116
Yeah, and the cell reception
is so spotty.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.747
- Really bad. Have you ever been there?
- Oh, but the mushrooms!

42:02.830 --> 42:04.250
- Really good.
- They are delish!

42:04.333 --> 42:05.920
We have some if you want
to take them home.

42:06.003 --> 42:07.757
Little olive oil, salt, pepper...

42:07.840 --> 42:08.926
Okay, I didn't think so.

42:10.805 --> 42:13.184
I'm just happy that you both are okay.

42:13.268 --> 42:14.729
When you didn't show up,

42:14.813 --> 42:17.276
I was worried something
might've happened to you,

42:17.359 --> 42:18.737
or that you left us.

42:18.821 --> 42:22.202
Left you? How is that even...?

42:22.286 --> 42:24.749
Where would we go?

42:24.833 --> 42:27.296
The Hernandez's ranch in Yucatan.

42:27.379 --> 42:31.095
Oh, you, um... know about the ranch.

42:31.178 --> 42:33.141
Seems like a lovely property,

42:33.224 --> 42:34.853
completely off the grid,

42:34.936 --> 42:36.188
held in a private trust,

42:36.272 --> 42:39.613
hidden behind a wall of LLCs and DBAs.

42:39.696 --> 42:42.117
So thoughtful of Gene and Alice

42:42.200 --> 42:45.583
to leave that to you in their will,

42:45.666 --> 42:48.839
almost like they wanted you
to have someplace to run to.

42:50.843 --> 42:54.391
I mean, it's just a shack in the jungle.
We're not even...

42:54.475 --> 42:57.022
I'm sure that sounds
like paradise right now.

42:57.117 --> 42:58.887
I assume that's why
you've been transferring

42:58.911 --> 43:00.911
large amounts of money there.

43:00.988 --> 43:01.990
Anyhow...

43:05.038 --> 43:06.415
dreamers gotta dream...

43:08.378 --> 43:11.467
but I do hope you can focus
on the job that really matters.

43:12.845 --> 43:14.139
- Ours.
- Ours.

43:15.851 --> 43:18.982
It's on the top of my... the list.

43:19.066 --> 43:20.736
We're almost there.

43:24.076 --> 43:26.163
And by "we," I do mean all of us.

43:35.933 --> 43:37.854
Oh, my God.

43:37.937 --> 43:41.444
It's over. We're never getting out.

43:41.528 --> 43:45.243
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

43:45.326 --> 43:48.458
Um... You, uh, you wouldn't understand.

43:48.542 --> 43:50.546
Really?

43:50.629 --> 43:53.844
Just like I didn't understand you
guys were lying about the hedgehog?

43:53.927 --> 43:55.806
- Maybe if you guys finally...
- You know what, Gert?

43:55.890 --> 43:59.062
This attitude needs to stop.
The sarcasm, the snide remarks.

43:59.146 --> 44:02.402
So, admittedly, you got that
from me, I have had enough!

44:05.200 --> 44:06.202
Got it.

44:06.285 --> 44:08.456
No, Gert, wait a sec... Oh, God.

44:18.059 --> 44:20.731
Gert says this is from Leslie's laptop.

44:20.815 --> 44:23.069
How long do you think this will take?

44:23.152 --> 44:25.198
Oh, I'm getting there.

44:25.281 --> 44:27.285
The encryption on this
is a lot more complicated

44:27.369 --> 44:29.582
than you would expect
for a church group.

44:29.666 --> 44:33.214
But not someone hiding a murderer.

44:33.297 --> 44:35.511
Well, the good news is
by the time this is over,

44:35.594 --> 44:38.140
I'll have a pretty
high tolerance for caffeine.

44:38.224 --> 44:40.353
Great, we're already not sleeping.

44:43.442 --> 44:45.029
I got in.

44:49.288 --> 44:52.920
There's nothing in here about
any ritual church doctrines.

44:53.004 --> 44:55.091
It's files, intake files.

44:56.803 --> 44:57.889
Runaways.

45:33.084 --> 45:35.965
- Chase?
- Shit.

45:36.048 --> 45:39.262
Uh, sorry, I'll, uh,
I'll get out of here.

45:43.062 --> 45:44.691
You needed something?

45:45.859 --> 45:49.241
Uh, no, it's... nothing.

45:49.324 --> 45:50.911
Give me that.

45:52.665 --> 45:56.715
Dad, please, I've been working
on that for a long time,

45:56.756 --> 45:58.300
so just... please.

46:03.854 --> 46:05.691
I knew that was gonna happen

46:05.774 --> 46:07.611
when you got ahold of it, goddamn it!

46:07.695 --> 46:08.695
Sit down.

46:11.410 --> 46:12.410
Right there, sit.

46:22.390 --> 46:24.771
Now, tell me.

46:25.939 --> 46:27.108
Tell you what?

46:29.196 --> 46:32.410
That thing is the work of a child.
You got ahead of yourself.

46:32.494 --> 46:34.372
Don't worry about
the execution. Not yet.

46:35.667 --> 46:37.128
Just tell me your idea.

46:38.297 --> 46:39.926
Every detail. What it does.

46:40.009 --> 46:41.805
How it feels. How it makes you feel.

46:41.888 --> 46:44.811
Right now it is perfect in your mind,

46:44.894 --> 46:48.025
and that is where you need to
live while we build this thing.

46:49.277 --> 46:50.363
Take me there.

46:51.699 --> 46:53.410
What is this thing called?

46:56.083 --> 46:57.753
Fistigons.

46:59.381 --> 47:01.970
Destiny Gonzales, 18.

47:02.053 --> 47:04.099
No next of kin.

47:04.182 --> 47:06.311
Special consideration: per led.

47:08.149 --> 47:11.781
Geparhart, Brian, 16,
runaway. A Mexican.

47:13.660 --> 47:16.708
They're all "per led."
What does that mean?

47:16.791 --> 47:17.835
No idea.

47:22.343 --> 47:23.847
Is Amy in there?

47:30.026 --> 47:31.905
You think they're all dead?

47:34.159 --> 47:35.787
One way to find out.

47:37.750 --> 47:39.377
Nothing.

47:39.461 --> 47:42.635
Yeah, there's no mention in
here of any of these names.

47:42.718 --> 47:47.770
Because they were nobody.
No one cared for these kids.

47:47.853 --> 47:50.651
Not even enough to file
a missing persons report.

47:50.734 --> 47:52.821
One a year for 15 years.

48:00.879 --> 48:03.008
Leslie's maiden name is Ellerh.

48:04.177 --> 48:07.475
L-E-D. Leslie Ellerh Dean.

48:07.559 --> 48:08.559
Led.

48:11.233 --> 48:12.903
So our parents are serial killers,

48:12.987 --> 48:15.074
and Karolina's mother
hand-picks the victims?

48:16.828 --> 48:17.871
Do we tell her?

48:19.040 --> 48:20.669
We have to.

48:20.752 --> 48:22.798
Anyone drive a silver Prius?

48:22.881 --> 48:25.846
Plate frame says
"My other ride is a Tardis."

48:25.929 --> 48:27.808
Um, yeah, that's me.

48:27.891 --> 48:29.477
Alarm's going off, bro.

48:29.562 --> 48:32.442
- Go. I'll call her.
- Okay.

48:58.953 --> 48:59.953
Mom?

49:08.640 --> 49:10.017
What's up, Nico?

49:10.101 --> 49:11.687
Alex cracked the files.

49:11.771 --> 49:13.315
They weren't about any ceremony.

49:13.399 --> 49:16.113
They were about...

49:16.196 --> 49:18.200
<i>So Destiny isn't the only runaway</i>

49:18.283 --> 49:20.539
<i>to go missing from your church.</i>

49:22.208 --> 49:23.837
<i>And it looks like your mom</i>

49:23.920 --> 49:25.799
<i>was the one choosing the victims.</i>

49:25.882 --> 49:28.972
<i>They've been taking people
for over 15 years.</i>

49:29.055 --> 49:32.980
<i>We don't know if Amy
was involved in all this.</i>

49:49.638 --> 49:51.767
<i>- Karolina, are you there?</i>
- Hey, hon.

49:54.022 --> 49:56.777
<i>Come meet us. We're at Timely.</i>

49:56.861 --> 49:59.700
<i>Karolina, are you there?
Can you hear me?</i>

50:01.411 --> 50:02.831
Where is he?

50:09.762 --> 50:12.559
Get off me! Aah! Stop! Hey!

50:13.645 --> 50:16.358
Alex! Alex!

50:16.441 --> 50:19.573
Alex! Alex!

50:19.657 --> 50:22.579
<i>- What is it?</i>
- Someone took Alex.
