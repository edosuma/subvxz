WEBVTT

00:00.832 --> 00:04.362
This is a historic day.
At 12:01 this morning,

00:04.482 --> 00:06.200
the city of Eagleton
ceased to exist

00:06.251 --> 00:08.252
and was re-absorbed
back into Pawnee.

00:08.286 --> 00:10.087
Things are exactly
the way they were

00:10.121 --> 00:12.105
back in 1817, except, you know,

00:12.157 --> 00:13.740
women and minorities can vote,

00:13.775 --> 00:15.259
we have indoor toilets,

00:15.293 --> 00:18.228
and we no longer burn widows
for learning arithmetic.

00:18.262 --> 00:20.814
Councilwoman Knope
is your merger czar,

00:20.865 --> 00:22.466
and in the binders
that she's provided,

00:22.500 --> 00:25.302
you will find directions
to your department in Pawnee

00:25.336 --> 00:27.905
that most closely matches
your department in Eagleton.

00:27.939 --> 00:29.239
There are two
Eagleton departments

00:29.257 --> 00:30.257
Pawnee does not have:

00:30.291 --> 00:33.110
the Department
of Infinity Pool Design

00:33.144 --> 00:34.778
and the Department of Dressage,

00:34.796 --> 00:37.247
which I am told is
a fancy horse-riding thing.

00:37.265 --> 00:39.833
It is horse-dancing, madam.

00:39.868 --> 00:41.484
Okay, take it easy, Alonzo.

00:41.503 --> 00:44.287
All you horse dancing people,
sit in your saddles if you will.

00:44.305 --> 00:46.723
The rest of you,
welcome to your new departments.

00:46.757 --> 00:50.010
Attention: Eagleton is
now under martial law.

00:50.044 --> 00:51.011
No.

00:53.982 --> 01:04.919
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:10.815 --> 01:12.332
Okay, Pawnee Parks Department.

01:12.383 --> 01:14.417
Soon, you will be paired up
with a person

01:14.435 --> 01:16.720
who was roughly
your equivalent in Eagleton.

01:16.738 --> 01:18.705
Donna, you'll be with Craig.

01:18.740 --> 01:21.174
April, you'll be with someone
named Tynnyfer.

01:21.226 --> 01:23.510
And Ron, your guy is
also named Ron.

01:23.545 --> 01:25.762
Guess there's
no Tom Haverford equivalent.

01:25.797 --> 01:27.714
Not surprised,
I'm one of a kind,

01:27.765 --> 01:29.132
just like the custom Nikes
I designed

01:29.166 --> 01:31.852
that say "Tommy's Tootsies"
across the toes.

01:31.903 --> 01:33.203
You do have
a counterpart, actually.

01:33.237 --> 01:35.505
His name is Eric,
and I've heard he's amazing.

01:35.540 --> 01:37.591
Anyway, I also have
a little surprise.

01:37.642 --> 01:39.860
I would like to introduce
our new filing temp.

01:39.911 --> 01:41.995
- Hey, everybody.
- No!

01:42.046 --> 01:43.981
No, why?
This can't be happening.

01:44.015 --> 01:45.365
Why, Leslie?

01:45.400 --> 01:47.284
We brought Jerry
out of retirement

01:47.318 --> 01:49.253
because we have a mountain
of filing to get through.

01:49.287 --> 01:51.605
- Welcome back, Jerry Gergic.
- Thank you, Leslie.

01:51.639 --> 01:53.323
And as long
as we're starting out fresh,

01:53.357 --> 01:54.675
Leslie, I was wondering
if people

01:54.709 --> 01:56.159
would call me by my real name.

01:56.177 --> 01:58.145
- Larry?
- No, it's not Larry.

01:58.179 --> 02:00.163
It's Jerry.
No, it's Gary.

02:00.198 --> 02:02.249
Your name is Larry,
Larry Gengurch.

02:02.283 --> 02:03.650
His name is Larry Gengurch.

02:03.685 --> 02:05.102
Come on, April,
it's already hard enough

02:05.136 --> 02:07.738
for my family
when you call me "Gary."

02:07.772 --> 02:09.538
- Jerry.
- Ha, ha, classic Larry.

02:09.573 --> 02:11.808
Larry.

02:11.843 --> 02:13.760
- Larry, Larry, Larry.
- Aw, jeez.

02:13.795 --> 02:16.413
Look, I'm trying to save
as many jobs as possible,

02:16.447 --> 02:18.348
but we're gonna have to
lose some people.

02:18.383 --> 02:19.933
I'm not sure
who we should keep.

02:19.968 --> 02:21.902
April, Tom and Donna are three
of the best human beings

02:21.936 --> 02:23.287
that have ever lived.

02:23.321 --> 02:26.773
Ron is basically a better
version of George Washington.

02:26.808 --> 02:31.495
But...the Eagletonians
are probably good too.

02:31.529 --> 02:34.264
Today, we are not just
merging two towns.

02:34.298 --> 02:36.650
We're throwing
a birthday party for a new city.

02:36.701 --> 02:41.888
Happy birthday, New Pawnee.

02:41.939 --> 02:43.357
Party's over.

02:43.391 --> 02:46.376
You guys lost millions
of taxpayer dollars,

02:46.410 --> 02:49.229
and we have to clean up
the obscene mess you've made.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.281
You're not as nice
as the other guy.

02:51.315 --> 02:53.250
I don't care.

02:53.284 --> 02:56.269
When we were state auditors,
we had an amazing system.

02:56.321 --> 02:58.105
Yeah, Chris pumped everyone up

02:58.156 --> 02:59.840
and made them feel positive
and happy.

02:59.874 --> 03:03.160
And I swooped in and slashed
their budgets to ribbons.

03:03.194 --> 03:04.911
Like a majestic alley-oop.

03:04.946 --> 03:07.247
You're all amazing!

03:07.298 --> 03:09.182
You're all fired.

03:09.217 --> 03:10.817
Teamwork.

03:10.852 --> 03:12.903
Hi, you've reached
the voicemail

03:12.937 --> 03:16.139
of Larry Gengurch.

03:16.174 --> 03:18.775
Please leave your message
after the tone.

03:18.810 --> 03:20.443
Well, when Leslie called
to see if I could help,

03:20.461 --> 03:23.380
Gayle and I were just getting
on a cruise ship

03:23.398 --> 03:24.948
to the Bahamas.

03:24.982 --> 03:26.783
I said, "Gayle, put that
bikini away,

03:26.818 --> 03:28.852
because Pawnee needs me."

03:28.886 --> 03:33.106
Oh ho! Somebody forgot
a banana in here--ooh!

03:33.157 --> 03:34.791
Hi, I'm Donna.

03:34.826 --> 03:36.209
Oh, that is the perfect
name for you.

03:36.244 --> 03:37.928
I love it.
Never change it!

03:37.962 --> 03:41.097
Wasn't gonna.
You're Craig, right?

03:41.115 --> 03:43.417
Ugh, yes, but I hate that name.

03:43.451 --> 03:45.502
It's so boring.
Sounds like someone's cousin.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.887
Craig! Craig!

03:46.938 --> 03:48.605
I want to be a Spanish man
named Terrence,

03:48.639 --> 03:50.457
but that didn't happen.

03:50.508 --> 03:54.695
Okay. So here's
my list of duties.

03:54.729 --> 03:56.913
I'm basically
the office manager.

03:56.948 --> 03:59.299
- How about you?
- Oh, I did everything.

03:59.333 --> 04:00.567
Everything!

04:00.601 --> 04:01.818
I carried the Eagleton
department on my shoulders

04:01.853 --> 04:03.403
for years, and I loved
every second of it.

04:03.454 --> 04:06.289
You don't even know!

04:06.307 --> 04:07.707
I'm sorry,
was your name Jennifer?

04:07.725 --> 04:10.444
No, it's Tynnyffer with two y's.

04:10.495 --> 04:12.379
I used to be Jennifer,
but then I decided

04:12.430 --> 04:14.981
to rebrand myself.

04:15.032 --> 04:17.250
Oh, wait, hang on.
It's Xanax o'clock.

04:21.172 --> 04:24.541
Um, well, nice to meet you.

04:24.575 --> 04:25.909
My name's April,

04:25.943 --> 04:29.446
and I just wanted to say
that your dress is so cute

04:29.480 --> 04:30.564
it's bonks.

04:30.615 --> 04:32.282
I saw my spinning
instructor wearing it,

04:32.316 --> 04:34.501
and I was like, "Shut up.
Where do I get that?"

04:34.535 --> 04:36.295
Oh, my God.
Who's your spinning instructor?

04:36.304 --> 04:37.771
Gregory or Wynona?

04:37.805 --> 04:40.190
I go to Yonis.
Who are Gregory and Wynona?

04:40.224 --> 04:41.157
I've never
heard of them before.

04:41.175 --> 04:44.127
- Are they better?
- Wynona rocks my world.

04:44.145 --> 04:45.779
Seriously, you need
to get me in there.

04:45.813 --> 04:48.281
Like, that's a must,
must, must.

04:48.316 --> 04:50.667
She's the worst person
I've ever met.

04:50.701 --> 04:52.853
I want to travel
the world with her.

04:52.887 --> 04:55.255
Ron.

04:55.289 --> 04:58.024
Ron.

04:58.059 --> 04:59.375
Last name?

04:59.393 --> 05:00.977
Dunne.

05:01.011 --> 05:02.746
Is that your name,

05:02.780 --> 05:04.914
or are you telling me
you're finished talking?

05:04.932 --> 05:07.768
Both.

05:07.819 --> 05:09.319
Dunne and done.

05:11.889 --> 05:16.092
I like Ron.

05:16.110 --> 05:18.161
- Hi.
- Well, well, well.

05:18.196 --> 05:19.296
You must be Eric.

05:19.330 --> 05:22.632
I'm Ragiv from I.T.
This is E.R.I.C.

05:22.666 --> 05:24.568
E.R.I.C. is
a computer program?

05:24.602 --> 05:27.270
Stands for Eagleton
Reservation Information Center.

05:27.288 --> 05:29.039
It does all the scheduling
in Eagleton.

05:29.073 --> 05:30.457
I'm here to install it.

05:30.508 --> 05:32.709
But scheduling's
the main part of my job.

05:32.743 --> 05:33.827
You still have a human being

05:33.861 --> 05:35.311
in charge of booking
tennis courts?

05:35.329 --> 05:37.580
What is this, 1990?

05:37.598 --> 05:39.182
I guess that explains
the shoulder pads.

05:44.688 --> 05:46.556
How did he notice these?

05:46.591 --> 05:49.342
Hey, this is a surprise.

05:49.393 --> 05:51.695
Yeah, I just wanted to
chat for a sec.

05:51.729 --> 05:54.164
You know, just so you could
hear some things from me.

05:54.198 --> 05:56.032
Verbal things from my mouth.

05:56.066 --> 05:57.384
Did that sound weird?

05:57.418 --> 05:59.686
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

05:59.720 --> 06:00.987
First of all, this is Evelyn.

06:01.022 --> 06:02.606
Oh, hello.

06:02.640 --> 06:05.125
She is my Health Department
counterpart from Eagleton.

06:05.159 --> 06:06.993
There really wasn't a ton
of work for me there.

06:07.028 --> 06:08.812
Eagletonians are very healthy.

06:08.846 --> 06:10.146
Oh, well, this might be

06:10.180 --> 06:11.814
a very interesting challenge
for you,

06:11.833 --> 06:13.166
because Pawnee has the very
first documented case

06:13.201 --> 06:14.918
of mega-diabetes.

06:14.952 --> 06:17.086
And the only know occurrence

06:17.104 --> 06:19.105
of Lou Gehrig's other disease.

06:19.140 --> 06:20.924
We've been written about
in textbooks.

06:20.942 --> 06:22.659
Thanks, Evelyn, I'll
see you back in my office.

06:22.693 --> 06:25.996
I just need to talk some more
words into Leslie's face.

06:26.030 --> 06:28.465
Nice to meet you.
Ahem.

06:28.499 --> 06:29.933
Wow. I feel sorry for her.

06:29.967 --> 06:31.935
I mean, nobody can fill
your shoes, Ann.

06:31.969 --> 06:33.603
With your tiny
little doll feet.

06:33.637 --> 06:35.655
Actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

06:35.706 --> 06:38.708
I, uh, I'm gonna step down,

06:38.743 --> 06:41.077
and I'm gonna turn my job
over to Evelyn.

06:41.111 --> 06:42.162
What? No.

06:42.213 --> 06:43.663
Did somebody
put you up to this?

06:43.714 --> 06:46.115
Was it Evelyn?
I knew she was a monster.

06:46.133 --> 06:47.217
No.
No, no, no.

06:47.251 --> 06:48.919
Chris and I have been talking,

06:48.953 --> 06:51.304
and we are thinking
very seriously

06:51.339 --> 06:52.973
about leaving Pawnee

06:53.007 --> 06:56.092
and moving somewhere else
to start our family--

06:56.126 --> 06:58.728
Oh, my God, look at that.
It's waffles!

06:58.763 --> 07:01.147
- Delicious waffles.
- Wait.

07:01.182 --> 07:03.066
Should we try?
Yeah, let's try.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.351
- Huh?
- Mmm.

07:04.402 --> 07:05.902
- Wait, what were you saying?
- Try.

07:05.937 --> 07:09.856
Just enjoy. Yeah.
There we go.

07:11.826 --> 07:13.263
So, if I'm hearing you correctly,

07:13.422 --> 07:15.414
you're telling me you're not
thinking about leaving Pawnee.

07:15.534 --> 07:17.177
I am thinking about leaving.

07:17.297 --> 07:19.715
Is this one of those classic
Ann "not" jokes?

07:19.766 --> 07:21.483
Like, "I'm leaving
Pawnee...not!"

07:21.518 --> 07:22.337
I don't do that.

07:22.457 --> 07:23.724
I was hoping
that you had started.

07:23.841 --> 07:24.858
It's not definite.

07:24.892 --> 07:26.359
It's just neither of us
are from Pawnee.

07:26.393 --> 07:29.475
And I have a whole family
in Michigan.

07:29.595 --> 07:32.114
And Chris is missing life
in a bigger city.

07:32.148 --> 07:33.965
And I just wanted...

07:34.000 --> 07:36.080
to talk to you about it
so you could hear it from me.

07:38.154 --> 07:39.806
- Do you hear that galloping?
- Hmm?

07:39.926 --> 07:42.963
Wha--oh, my--
look at that!

07:43.083 --> 07:46.078
Joe Biden on a horse shirtless.

07:46.112 --> 07:48.363
That's amazing!

07:48.398 --> 07:50.315
Uh, I've got
a ton of work to do.

07:50.350 --> 07:52.234
I'm super busy, so you...

07:52.268 --> 07:55.286
can let yourself...

07:55.304 --> 07:58.190
Look, if Ann wants to leave
Pawnee, I get it.

07:58.224 --> 07:59.574
I mean, who wants to stay

07:59.625 --> 08:01.460
in the greatest town
in the world

08:01.494 --> 08:03.178
with her best friend
and be happy forever

08:03.212 --> 08:06.164
when she can abandon
her soul sister like an old shoe

08:06.199 --> 08:08.583
and move to a garbage city
full of jerks.

08:08.618 --> 08:11.853
I get it.
No hard feelings.

08:11.888 --> 08:14.039
- You have to text me.
- I will.

08:14.073 --> 08:15.323
Sorry for the delay, ladies,

08:15.375 --> 08:17.209
I was busy being
ambushed by treachery.

08:17.243 --> 08:19.144
So did you have a chance
to compare notes

08:19.178 --> 08:20.562
on your respective duties?

08:20.613 --> 08:21.697
Totally.

08:21.748 --> 08:23.565
Tynny and I have been, like,
totally bonding.

08:23.599 --> 08:25.717
We've just been like blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah!

08:25.751 --> 08:27.119
Like, talking, like,
so much forever.

08:27.153 --> 08:29.571
- It was all so delicious.
- I know, right?

08:29.622 --> 08:30.789
This is, like,
the best day ever.

08:30.823 --> 08:32.640
I know, I'm eating it all up.

08:32.674 --> 08:34.192
Wow. It's nice to see
a friendship blossoming

08:34.226 --> 08:38.230
instead of wiling away
like a dying turd flower.

08:38.264 --> 08:40.298
Totes.
Um, we also came up

08:40.316 --> 08:41.982
with these nicknames
for each other.

08:42.034 --> 08:45.187
Slut and Skank.

08:45.221 --> 08:46.855
How craze-mazing
is that, Lez?

08:46.889 --> 08:49.408
Well, you know what I think
is craze-mazing? Commitment.

08:49.442 --> 08:52.144
I'm looking for someone who's
in it for the long haul.

08:52.178 --> 08:54.563
We are basically creating
a new version of Pawnee,

08:54.597 --> 08:56.581
and if Pawnee is gonna commit
to one of you,

08:56.616 --> 08:57.982
you need to commit to Pawnee.

08:58.000 --> 08:58.967
Tynnyfer, do you have kids?

08:59.001 --> 09:00.102
Ew, no.

09:00.136 --> 09:01.486
I've had so much rejuvenation

09:01.521 --> 09:02.988
that I don't think a baby
could get out of there

09:03.022 --> 09:04.289
if it tried.

09:04.323 --> 09:05.924
You know it.

09:05.958 --> 09:08.260
I guess we can make
a switch to Bermuda grass.

09:08.294 --> 09:10.195
It's only 80 cents more
per square foot?

09:10.229 --> 09:12.664
What? Gimme gimme gimme.

09:12.698 --> 09:15.567
You want me to put Bermuda
grass in a continental climate

09:15.601 --> 09:17.402
that's a six on beaufort scale?

09:17.437 --> 09:19.004
In a park with zero drainage?

09:19.038 --> 09:21.473
I want Kentucky bluegrass,
I want a 10 percent discount,

09:21.507 --> 09:23.759
and I want you to apologize
to my best friend Donna!

09:26.696 --> 09:28.146
Yeah, hi.

09:28.164 --> 09:29.914
Is there--
and I'm just guessing here--

09:29.932 --> 09:32.250
some kind of medication
that you maybe

09:32.268 --> 09:34.152
need a lot of
and have taken none of

09:34.186 --> 09:35.403
or maybe too much of today?

09:35.455 --> 09:37.422
Oh, I have a medical
condition all right.

09:37.457 --> 09:39.357
It's called caring too much!

09:39.392 --> 09:41.726
And it's incurable!

09:41.744 --> 09:45.413
Also I have eczema.

09:45.465 --> 09:49.317
Okay, Eagleton Ron, tell me
a little about yourself.

09:49.352 --> 09:51.920
Well, I love the outdoors,
love nature.

09:51.954 --> 09:53.455
Amen.

09:53.506 --> 09:55.423
I'm a big believer
in environmental conservation.

09:55.475 --> 09:57.926
Recycling and composting
and the like.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.480
I'm a yoga nut.
And I'm a nut nut.

10:02.765 --> 10:04.232
They make delicious milks, man.

10:04.267 --> 10:05.901
And I'm a vegan, of course.

10:05.935 --> 10:08.336
Slowly working toward
full freegan-vegan.

10:08.371 --> 10:10.772
What in God's name is
freegan-vegan?

10:10.807 --> 10:12.274
You only eat vegetables

10:12.325 --> 10:13.775
that have been thrown out
in people's dumpsters.

10:13.826 --> 10:16.528
What is on your foot, sir?

10:16.562 --> 10:18.430
My trusty sandals.

10:18.464 --> 10:21.399
I believe a man's feet
should remain uncaged.

10:21.433 --> 10:23.335
Same goes for all chickens.

10:23.369 --> 10:25.303
Well, Eagleton Ron,

10:25.338 --> 10:29.090
we here in Pawnee value
loyalty above all else.

10:29.125 --> 10:31.293
So would you be opposed
to signing

10:31.327 --> 10:33.895
an official loyalty pledge
to our new town?

10:33.930 --> 10:36.681
As long as that new town
were open to the ideals

10:36.715 --> 10:39.284
of communal living,
everyone pitches in

10:39.318 --> 10:40.919
towards a common good.

10:40.953 --> 10:42.771
In the immortal words
of Cat Stevens,

10:42.805 --> 10:46.291
"If you want to be free,
be free."

10:46.325 --> 10:49.261
I no longer like Ron.

10:49.295 --> 10:50.812
E.R.I.C. is
an amazing program.

10:50.847 --> 10:52.998
Fast, fun and easy to use.

10:53.032 --> 10:55.634
But there's one thing
no man or machine

10:55.668 --> 10:57.502
can beat Tom Haverford at--

10:57.520 --> 11:00.188
talking mad trash
till I get what I want.

11:00.239 --> 11:02.624
This guy Eric is a disaster.

11:02.658 --> 11:04.626
- What do you mean?
- Just a bad attitude.

11:04.660 --> 11:06.177
"Oh, I hate this place.
Get me out here."

11:06.211 --> 11:08.647
That kind of thing.
And unreliable.

11:08.681 --> 11:10.332
And racist.

11:10.366 --> 11:11.583
I think he may have even
been to jail.

11:11.617 --> 11:13.051
Although, you know,

11:13.085 --> 11:14.636
maybe those are just
regular face tattoos.

11:14.687 --> 11:17.239
Wow. That's not good.

11:17.273 --> 11:18.340
I should probably talk to him.

11:18.374 --> 11:20.091
Well, let me see if can
turn him around.

11:20.126 --> 11:21.259
I don't want to put this
on your plate.

11:21.293 --> 11:22.460
You have a lot to deal with.

11:22.478 --> 11:25.196
Thanks, Tom.
You're the best.

11:26.949 --> 11:28.783
Okay, let's take a look
at this list of assets

11:28.818 --> 11:30.352
owned by
the Eagleton government.

11:30.386 --> 11:32.954
400 Segway scooters.

11:32.989 --> 11:34.238
Sell 'em.
They're gone.

11:34.257 --> 11:36.458
You had six full-time baristas
on the payroll.

11:36.492 --> 11:38.143
The baristas are gone.

11:38.177 --> 11:40.445
As are the masseurs.

11:40.479 --> 11:42.297
And the full-time barista

11:42.331 --> 11:44.666
who provided coffee
for the masseurs.

11:44.717 --> 11:45.984
It is excellent

11:46.018 --> 11:47.652
having the old band
back together again.

11:47.687 --> 11:49.120
You know what?

11:49.155 --> 11:52.257
This calls for some
celebratory lunges.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.009
One...

11:54.060 --> 11:55.293
two...

11:55.311 --> 11:56.528
All right, Donna.

11:56.562 --> 11:57.913
There's gonna have to be
some cutbacks.

11:57.947 --> 11:59.364
I mean, your job
is secure, of course.

11:59.382 --> 12:01.199
You're basically the glue
of this department.

12:01.217 --> 12:03.518
But I think Craig's
gonna have to go.

12:03.552 --> 12:05.236
No, you should keep him.

12:05.271 --> 12:07.455
He's crazy intense,
but I've never met anyone

12:07.490 --> 12:09.107
who cares more about this job.

12:09.125 --> 12:11.209
Uh, Donna, I'm right here.

12:11.243 --> 12:13.128
No joke.
He might care more than you.

12:13.162 --> 12:14.746
Honestly, if I had to choose
between him and me,

12:14.780 --> 12:16.715
- I'd choose him.
- Wait, what are you saying?

12:16.749 --> 12:17.949
Are you thinking about leaving?

12:17.950 --> 12:19.283
I wasn't planning on it,
but I could.

12:19.302 --> 12:20.852
You know, I got the condo
in Seattle,

12:20.886 --> 12:22.153
the fiance in Denver.

12:22.188 --> 12:24.406
- Huh?
- It won't last.

12:24.457 --> 12:26.257
Leslie, I would be happy
to go back into retirement

12:26.292 --> 12:27.509
if you have to cut the staff.

12:27.543 --> 12:29.511
What?
Even Larry wants out?

12:29.562 --> 12:30.802
What the hell
is happening here?

12:30.813 --> 12:32.130
Does everybody think
that running a town

12:32.164 --> 12:33.431
is just some game

12:33.449 --> 12:35.734
where people can come
and go as they please?

12:35.768 --> 12:37.919
Okey-dokey, Leslie.
You're mad at me.

12:37.954 --> 12:39.370
Don't take it out
on everybody else.

12:39.388 --> 12:41.222
- It's not fair.
- I'll tell you what's not fair.

12:41.257 --> 12:43.174
I'm gonna have to watch
the Oscars with Ben

12:43.208 --> 12:44.476
alone this year.

12:44.510 --> 12:46.361
Last year, don't you remember

12:46.395 --> 12:48.363
Angelina Jolie
and the leg dress moment?

12:48.414 --> 12:51.967
He had, and I quote,
"no comment."

12:52.001 --> 12:53.018
How can you not have
an extreme reaction

12:53.052 --> 12:54.185
about a dress like that?

12:54.219 --> 12:55.353
It just doesn't make any sense!

12:55.387 --> 12:57.322
- Okay, we need to talk.
- I'm sorry, Ann.

12:57.356 --> 12:58.406
I can't understand you.

12:58.457 --> 12:59.538
You've developed some accent

12:59.542 --> 13:01.543
from that new town
you might move to!

13:01.577 --> 13:03.762
It seems like
no one around here

13:03.796 --> 13:05.597
understands the meaning
of loyalty.

13:05.631 --> 13:07.799
I am the merger czar.
I make the rules.

13:07.817 --> 13:09.317
And I'm gonna teach people
the meaning of loyalty

13:09.368 --> 13:10.819
in a language
they will understand--

13:10.870 --> 13:13.121
complicated legalese.

13:13.155 --> 13:15.373
Knope,
what are these contracts?

13:15.407 --> 13:17.375
It's just a little something
that I drew up

13:17.409 --> 13:18.927
for all the employees
of the new town.

13:18.961 --> 13:20.628
Basic boilerplate language,

13:20.680 --> 13:22.120
50-year commitment,
blah, blah, blah.

13:22.131 --> 13:24.082
I'm so sorry, honey,
but Tynny and I

13:24.100 --> 13:26.801
won't sign anything until we
speak with our life coach.

13:26.852 --> 13:27.886
When Eric saw this,

13:27.920 --> 13:29.688
he smashed a bunch
of computers.

13:29.722 --> 13:32.057
- Why are you doing this?
- What's the big deal?

13:32.091 --> 13:33.608
I'm just trying to stop time

13:33.642 --> 13:35.527
with legally-binding
friendship contracts.

13:35.561 --> 13:37.228
What part of that
do you not understand?

13:37.262 --> 13:40.031
You have lost your mind.

13:40.066 --> 13:42.143
I think you need
a spa day, Les.

13:42.263 --> 13:44.069
Fine! You only have to work
here until I'm dead!

13:44.103 --> 13:45.476
Is that better?

13:48.635 --> 13:51.939
What in the name of all
that is holy is that smell?

13:52.331 --> 13:54.329
Yerba matte tea.

13:54.449 --> 13:56.116
Sweetened with stevia.

13:56.150 --> 13:58.318
It's an all-natural
plant extract.

13:58.352 --> 14:00.237
Shut your damn mouth.

14:00.288 --> 14:01.208
No need to curse.

14:01.336 --> 14:02.670
There most certainly is.

14:02.688 --> 14:05.824
Okay, all Eagleton people
meet me in the conference room.

14:05.875 --> 14:08.960
All Pawnee people,
sit at your desks.

14:08.994 --> 14:10.311
And take it personally.

14:10.346 --> 14:13.531
I kind of feel like we
got off on the wrong foot,

14:13.566 --> 14:16.417
so I made unity cookies

14:16.435 --> 14:17.852
with the Pawnee town's
original colors

14:17.886 --> 14:19.070
of blue and yellow.

14:19.121 --> 14:20.605
However, I did not have
yellow frosting,

14:20.639 --> 14:22.006
so I had to use mustard.

14:22.041 --> 14:22.974
But do not worry.

14:23.025 --> 14:24.275
I put tons of sugar on them,

14:24.326 --> 14:25.360
so it will even it out.

14:26.395 --> 14:29.180
Mmm!
Sugar mustard.

14:29.215 --> 14:31.432
That's awful kind
of you, Leslie,

14:31.467 --> 14:33.117
but I'm afraid those are
a little too sweet for me.

14:33.152 --> 14:35.086
I unhooked from
that big sugar train

14:35.137 --> 14:36.888
over 30 years ago.

14:36.939 --> 14:39.624
You are a man of principle
and I respect that, cool Ron.

14:39.658 --> 14:41.576
So, what's your story, new Ann?

14:41.610 --> 14:42.644
You're kind of pretty.

14:42.678 --> 14:43.595
I mean, you're not
"Ann" pretty,

14:43.646 --> 14:44.596
but you have potential.

14:44.647 --> 14:45.730
Thank you,

14:45.781 --> 14:46.965
but I-I don't work
in this department.

14:46.999 --> 14:48.115
Shut your kind of pretty mouth

14:48.133 --> 14:49.584
and, uh, eat a mustard cookie.

14:49.602 --> 14:52.120
Okay, so let's
chit-chat, huh?

14:52.154 --> 14:53.654
Let's get to know each other

14:53.672 --> 14:54.806
and then become
familiar best friends.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.090
I don't have time for this.

14:56.124 --> 14:57.659
I'm halfway through
designing a bamboo gazebo

14:57.693 --> 14:59.611
as a tribute to
the founders of motown.

14:59.662 --> 15:00.995
That's so Craig.

15:01.029 --> 15:03.181
Oh, Craig!
We have fun, don't we?

15:03.232 --> 15:05.016
Do you guys remember
when this all started

15:05.067 --> 15:06.317
and I came in here
with the cookies,

15:06.368 --> 15:08.102
and then Craig said
something so Craig

15:08.137 --> 15:10.588
and we all laughed,
and we were like, "Craig!"

15:10.639 --> 15:13.691
Do you think it would
be weird if we held hands?

15:13.742 --> 15:14.959
- Probably.
- This way, please.

15:14.994 --> 15:17.428
Excuse me, Ron, I am
talking to my best friends.

15:17.463 --> 15:20.949
Let me go!
Best friends, attack Ron!

15:20.983 --> 15:23.284
Ben, it has been an honor
watching you work today.

15:23.302 --> 15:25.603
It's been like watching
Leonardo work.

15:25.638 --> 15:27.972
Da Vinci or DiCaprio.
You're that good.

15:28.007 --> 15:31.692
Thanks, man.
I was in the zone today.

15:31.710 --> 15:33.628
This really has been
a lot of fun.

15:33.662 --> 15:35.363
The old juice is back!

15:35.397 --> 15:36.864
Hey, should we keep this going?

15:36.899 --> 15:38.899
Celebratory dinner,
just like the old days?

15:38.918 --> 15:41.002
Ben, that's a great idea.
Hey, you know what?

15:41.020 --> 15:43.804
I know who I'm gonna use to
calculate tax and tip.

15:43.822 --> 15:46.424
Me?

15:46.458 --> 15:47.792
Can I just say something?

15:47.843 --> 15:49.944
I'm having
so much fun right now.

15:49.979 --> 15:52.697
Oh, my God, me too.
Like, so much fun.

15:52.731 --> 15:53.814
Can I just say
something, though?

15:53.832 --> 15:54.815
- Yeah.
- Okay.

15:54.833 --> 15:56.517
You don't want this job.

15:56.552 --> 15:59.103
Seriously, this place
is the pits.

15:59.138 --> 16:00.071
It's like, if you worked here,

16:00.105 --> 16:01.322
you'd be like, "Ugh!"

16:01.357 --> 16:03.074
And Leslie would be like,
"Blah, blah, blah."

16:03.108 --> 16:04.842
And you'd be like,
"Uh..."

16:04.877 --> 16:06.094
Okay, can I say something?

16:06.128 --> 16:08.129
Right now, I totally
think that you're right,

16:08.147 --> 16:10.448
and I had been thinking about
going someplace warm

16:10.482 --> 16:12.500
while my husband is in jail.

16:12.534 --> 16:14.085
Oh, my God!
Can I just say something?

16:14.136 --> 16:15.219
- Yes!
- Okay.

16:15.271 --> 16:17.572
You should totally stay
at my house in Miami.

16:17.606 --> 16:19.123
- What?
- I'm serious.

16:19.158 --> 16:22.209
Come by anytime.
Just let yourself in.

16:22.227 --> 16:24.062
The gate kind of jams
sometimes,

16:24.113 --> 16:25.396
but you can just jump it.

16:25.447 --> 16:27.365
You are so amazing right now.

16:27.416 --> 16:31.135
You're like skinny
Mother Theresa.

16:31.186 --> 16:32.320
It's Dwayne Wade's house.

16:32.354 --> 16:34.889
I got his address
off the Internet.

16:34.923 --> 16:36.658
I really hope he's there
when she walks in

16:36.692 --> 16:39.510
and he throws a basketball
at her head.

16:39.561 --> 16:41.312
Okay, enough is enough.

16:41.363 --> 16:42.523
What is wrong with you, woman?

16:42.531 --> 16:43.881
I don't need to explain
myself to you!

16:43.916 --> 16:46.250
I am the czar.
I can do as I please.

16:46.285 --> 16:50.355
Those who cross the czar
feel the wrath of the czar!

16:51.790 --> 16:54.459
Ann is thinking about
leaving Pawnee.

16:54.493 --> 16:56.761
Moving, with Chris.

16:56.812 --> 16:58.329
Well, that's nice.

16:58.364 --> 17:00.281
Nice, Ron? Edible
arrangements are nice.

17:00.315 --> 17:02.800
This is
volcanically hot betrayal!

17:02.851 --> 17:04.018
She is my best friend!

17:04.053 --> 17:05.813
She's thinking about leaving,
just like that!

17:05.820 --> 17:07.622
And she wants to
"talk to me" about it?

17:07.656 --> 17:09.707
It's like, I don't even
know what to say.

17:09.742 --> 17:12.877
That you love her and you
understand that it's her life,

17:12.928 --> 17:15.445
and geography will never
change your feelings.

17:15.481 --> 17:16.748
Whatever.
I don't even need her.

17:16.781 --> 17:18.566
I've got Tynnyfer now,
and Craig,

17:18.584 --> 17:21.269
and Eric, the racist drug dealer
who I've yet to meet.

17:21.303 --> 17:22.720
Those are my real friends.

17:22.771 --> 17:24.856
You can't force friendship,
Leslie.

17:24.906 --> 17:26.457
It takes time.

17:26.492 --> 17:28.926
I once thought I had a friend.

17:28.961 --> 17:31.212
Then it turned out he was
the single worst person

17:31.230 --> 17:32.713
I have ever met.

17:32.731 --> 17:35.867
I agree with Ron, Leslie.

17:35.901 --> 17:38.169
It's like Moz once said.

17:38.203 --> 17:41.522
"Hold on to your friends."

17:41.557 --> 17:44.158
Morrissey.
The Smiths.

17:44.193 --> 17:45.610
You don't know <i>Meat Is Murder?</i>

17:45.661 --> 17:46.794
It's one of the best songs
ever written

17:46.829 --> 17:49.029
about industrialized
beef consumption.

17:49.048 --> 17:50.765
Okay, Eagleton Ron.

17:50.799 --> 17:52.233
I think it might be time
for you to go.

17:52.267 --> 17:55.103
This Ron has the position
pretty much locked up,

17:55.137 --> 17:58.156
and, uh, I don't think
we have any room for you

17:58.207 --> 17:59.157
in our department.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.324
Fair enough.

18:00.376 --> 18:02.410
I should have seen it.

18:02.444 --> 18:06.748
Taurus and Capricorns
never mix, do they?

18:06.782 --> 18:08.466
Just remember, Ron.

18:08.500 --> 18:12.503
Giving in to hate is like
drinking saltwater.

18:12.554 --> 18:15.640
The thirst only grows worse.

18:15.674 --> 18:17.175
Leslie, remove this man

18:17.226 --> 18:19.761
before I commit an act of
violence against him.

18:19.795 --> 18:23.564
Whatever you do,
I won't fight back.

18:26.794 --> 18:28.793
After I defeated him
in an epic struggle,

18:28.913 --> 18:29.896
E.R.I.C. is gone.

18:30.182 --> 18:32.744
He's been replaced
by T.O.M.--

18:32.864 --> 18:34.886
Town-wide
Organizational Matrix.

18:36.021 --> 18:38.106
Big plans tonight, Craig?

18:38.140 --> 18:39.707
No, I have a ton of work to do.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.995
Plus, my DVR
is 13 months pregnant

18:42.013 --> 18:43.382
with episodes of <i>Scandal.</i>

18:43.502 --> 18:45.015
Scandal's my favorite show.

18:45.050 --> 18:47.685
I love every character,
except for...

18:47.719 --> 18:49.002
Mellie.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.888
Oh!
Of course you like <i>Scandal!</i>

18:50.939 --> 18:53.594
Because you're amazing!
I love you.

18:53.714 --> 18:55.609
And no matter what happens
with this job,

18:55.643 --> 18:57.861
I will always love you.

18:57.896 --> 18:58.862
Excuse me!

18:58.897 --> 19:01.582
Who even are you?

19:01.616 --> 19:03.183
How's your salad?

19:03.201 --> 19:04.535
Well, it's called
the "Good Earth Salad,"

19:04.569 --> 19:06.686
but really, it's just cheese,

19:06.705 --> 19:10.157
toffee, and gummy bear worms.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.742
This town is really unhealthy.

19:11.793 --> 19:13.961
You know, I forgot
that this part

19:13.995 --> 19:15.412
of being accounting bros

19:15.463 --> 19:16.830
was actually pretty depressing.

19:16.864 --> 19:20.117
I mean, after the intense,
almost meth-like high

19:20.151 --> 19:21.585
of solving accounting puzzles,

19:21.636 --> 19:24.922
we were always just beat
at the end of the day.

19:24.973 --> 19:26.173
I actually think
it's something else.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.642
Back in the day,
this was all we had.

19:28.676 --> 19:30.978
We'd go into a town,
we'd fix problems.

19:31.012 --> 19:33.680
We'd go back
to some rundown motel.

19:33.714 --> 19:34.815
Yeah, you'd exercise.

19:34.849 --> 19:36.266
I'd re-watch <i>Twin Peaks,</i>

19:36.317 --> 19:37.884
then hit the <i>Twin Peaks</i>
<i>message boards</i>

19:37.902 --> 19:39.937
and read <i>The Secret Diary</i>
<i>of Laura Palmer</i>

19:39.988 --> 19:41.721
to find Easter Eggs I'd missed.

19:41.740 --> 19:44.057
But now, Ann and Leslie
are our real partners.

19:44.075 --> 19:46.193
Yeah.
It's a good thing.

19:46.227 --> 19:49.896
But you were a fine surrogate
before we found them.

19:49.914 --> 19:53.733
Just so you know,
we're thinking of moving.

19:53.752 --> 19:55.068
Don't know where yet.

19:55.086 --> 19:57.070
Maybe Michigan,
to be with Ann's family.

19:57.088 --> 20:00.591
Wow.
That makes me kind of sad.

20:00.625 --> 20:05.579
But also incredibly happy
for you and Ann.

20:05.597 --> 20:08.599
We have come a long way.

20:08.633 --> 20:10.134
Something healthy!

20:10.185 --> 20:11.585
A cherry tomato.

20:11.603 --> 20:13.187
Nope.

20:13.221 --> 20:14.772
A gumball.

20:14.806 --> 20:16.490
Ooh!

20:16.524 --> 20:20.144
What I really want to
say is, I'm sorry.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.862
You're my best friend.

20:21.896 --> 20:24.431
This whole thing is just
scary and confusing.

20:24.449 --> 20:25.699
I love you.

20:25.733 --> 20:26.934
I want to talk about this,

20:26.968 --> 20:30.571
all of this, whatever it means.

20:30.605 --> 20:31.939
Was that okay?

20:31.973 --> 20:33.457
I guess it's good.

20:33.508 --> 20:35.959
Again, I barely know
you or Ann,

20:36.010 --> 20:37.961
so I don't have much
to go off of.

20:38.012 --> 20:40.264
- Well...
- Hey, Leslie.

20:40.298 --> 20:42.966
Hey.
Uh, you are excused, Fake Ann.

20:43.017 --> 20:44.251
That was six hours well spent.

20:44.269 --> 20:45.769
I thank you.

20:45.804 --> 20:47.271
Looks like you've made
all your decisions.

20:47.305 --> 20:49.189
Well, almost.

20:49.224 --> 20:50.691
What were you talking
to Evelyn about?

20:50.725 --> 20:53.093
Nothing.
It's not important.

20:53.111 --> 20:55.028
The only thing
that's important is you.

20:55.063 --> 20:56.530
I'm ready to talk about this.

20:56.564 --> 20:58.782
I want to talk about this.

20:58.817 --> 21:01.201
Is now a good time?

21:02.537 --> 21:05.605
Yes.
Now is a great time.

21:06.136 --> 21:12.939
