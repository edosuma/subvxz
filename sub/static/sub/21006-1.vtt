01:17.610 --> 01:19.211
Oh! Ah!

01:21.948 --> 01:24.216
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

01:33.793 --> 01:35.327
Come on. Come on.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.396
Are you sure that we should
be doing this right now?

01:37.398 --> 01:39.431
Okay? There are people
outside waiting.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.333
They're going to wonder
where we are.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.502
All right, we're going to have
plenty of time after the wedding.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.370
I don't want to wait
until after the wedding.

01:45.372 --> 01:46.872
I want you right now.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.273
Come on.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.775
Come on!

01:49.777 --> 01:52.211
Oh, god.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.378
Christine!

01:54.347 --> 01:56.014
What the fuck?

01:56.016 --> 01:58.150
Hey, I'm so sorry, man.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.551
I wanted to wait until
after the wedding

01:59.553 --> 02:01.320
but she wanted
to do this right now.

02:02.155 --> 02:03.655
- Oh...
- Holy shit!

02:03.657 --> 02:07.092
- Bowie, I need you to...
- It's fine, man. I'm gonna get out... ah!

02:07.094 --> 02:09.695
- Oh!
- Oh! Damn, dude, that's a big wiener.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.763
- That's a big...
- Come on, man!

02:11.765 --> 02:13.699
- I'm sorry.
- Zip it up, please.

02:13.701 --> 02:16.001
I mean, I don't know if
it'll fit, though, right?

02:16.003 --> 02:17.769
Not the time. Wildly
inappropriate right now.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.571
Can't you just focus
on the guests, please?

02:19.573 --> 02:21.240
The wedding is obviously off.

02:21.242 --> 02:24.276
Great. I'm here for you. You're
my little king and I love you.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.245
You...

02:26.247 --> 02:28.147
You're garbage trash.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.548
And I always knew that.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.783
I can't wait to
never see you again.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.987
Garbage trash.

02:34.989 --> 02:37.089
And you, I don't like you
either, but I respect

02:37.091 --> 02:39.051
what's going on down there.
Let's get out of here.

02:40.426 --> 02:41.793
- I'm really sorry, man.
- Fuck off.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.095
- Yup.
- Yeah.

02:43.097 --> 02:44.429
So,

02:45.465 --> 02:47.065
you know this is
all your fault, right?

02:56.643 --> 02:57.976
Hi.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.790
<i>Hello.</i>

03:12.692 --> 03:14.660
<i>My name is
Beauregard Pemberton iv.</i>

03:14.662 --> 03:18.163
<i>For those of you who don't know me
I am the best man for this wedding</i>

03:18.165 --> 03:18.163
<i>betwixt my dear friend Harry</i>

03:18.165 --> 03:22.668
<i>and his surprisingly
accommodating fiancee Christine.</i>

03:25.139 --> 03:27.806
<i>You guys don't get that joke,
that's for sure. Uh...</i>

03:27.808 --> 03:30.342
<i>First of all, I'd just like to start
by saying that I am very happy</i>

03:30.344 --> 03:31.910
<i>that everyone from
Harry's bachelor party</i>

03:31.912 --> 03:34.079
<i>made it out and is here
and not dead.</i>

03:34.081 --> 03:36.081
<i>Wes, those eyebrows
are growing back.</i>

03:36.083 --> 03:37.549
<i>Good for you, bud.</i>

03:37.551 --> 03:39.918
<i>Anyway, that's not
why I'm here, guys.</i>

03:39.920 --> 03:42.387
<i>I'm here to
tell you guys a story.</i>

03:43.022 --> 03:44.823
<i>A story of waiting.</i>

03:44.825 --> 03:46.892
<i>Waiting for that perfect moment.</i>

03:46.894 --> 03:48.160
<i>That perfect day.</i>

03:49.362 --> 03:51.196
<i>This story is about a young boy.</i>

03:52.165 --> 03:53.665
<i>Let's just call him</i>

03:54.300 --> 03:55.300
<i>me.</i>

03:56.269 --> 03:58.270
<i>This story is about
that young boy's</i>

03:58.272 --> 03:59.972
<i>unbridled love</i>

04:00.873 --> 04:02.908
<i>for guns n' roses.</i>

04:02.910 --> 04:05.510
<i>Now in the mid to late '90s
you guys have to understand</i>

04:05.512 --> 04:07.479
<i>that coming off
the giant success</i>

04:07.481 --> 04:09.548
<i>of both</i>
use your illusions I <i> and</i> ii,

04:09.550 --> 04:11.350
<i>anticipation was high</i>

04:11.352 --> 04:12.985
<i>because this young boy
was finally old enough</i>

04:12.987 --> 04:16.588
<i>to attend his
first guns n' roses concert.</i>

04:16.589 --> 04:18.357
<i>Snake dancing
in front of the mirror,</i>

04:19.926 --> 04:21.660
<i>picking out that
perfect bandana.</i>

04:21.661 --> 04:23.929
<i>It was red, of course.</i>

04:23.931 --> 04:26.498
<i>And when that night came for
the concert he was there,</i>

04:26.500 --> 04:27.733
<i>in that arena,</i>

04:28.935 --> 04:32.571
<i>section 352, row Q, seat 77.</i>

04:35.441 --> 04:36.875
<i>That's when that...</i>

04:38.411 --> 04:41.580
<i>Son of a bitch announcer
came over the loudspeaker.</i>

04:43.449 --> 04:46.518
<i>I always have
trouble with this part.</i>

04:46.520 --> 04:48.754
Paradise city,
<i>wherever it exists...</i>

04:50.591 --> 04:52.231
<i>was not in
Atlanta, Georgia that day.</i>

04:54.127 --> 04:56.561
<i>Guns n' roses had broken up.</i>

05:00.633 --> 05:02.634
<i>So I think I explained
everything pretty good.</i>

05:02.636 --> 05:04.703
<i>I'll open up the floor
to some questions.</i>

05:04.705 --> 05:07.139
<i>Even though I'm not
quite sure which one of them</i>

05:07.141 --> 05:09.308
<i>is the AXL in this situation.</i>

05:09.310 --> 05:11.310
<i>I'm going to have to
get some more details later.</i>

05:11.980 --> 05:12.879
<i>Nobody?</i>

05:12.880 --> 05:16.615
<i>You don't even want to ask me what
my favorite song is?</i> Civil war.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.686
<i>Guys, the wedding is not
happening is what I'm saying.</i>

05:20.688 --> 05:22.087
What?

05:23.656 --> 05:26.058
<i>Okay, calm down.
Calm down, it's fine.</i>

05:26.060 --> 05:27.959
<i>I thought I really
walked you guys into that.</i>

05:27.961 --> 05:29.628
<i>I feel like
you guys are overreacting.</i>

05:29.630 --> 05:31.797
<i>Hey, guys, guys, guys. It's
fine, it's fine, it's fine.</i>

05:31.799 --> 05:35.600
<i>Okay, the road to happiness
is not a straight path, okay?</i>

05:35.602 --> 05:36.802
<i>It's bumpy.</i>

05:36.804 --> 05:39.037
<i>If Harry and Christine
want to make it work</i>

05:39.039 --> 05:40.472
<i>they will make it work,
okay, guys?</i>

05:40.474 --> 05:42.174
<i>Look at guns n' roses.
They figured it out.</i>

05:42.176 --> 05:44.576
<i>I mean sure, slash and
the band were irreplaceable.</i>

05:44.578 --> 05:46.278
<i>But the bucket-head years
were all right</i>

05:46.280 --> 05:48.780
<i>and</i> Chinese democracy
<i>had like two good songs.</i>

05:48.782 --> 05:50.482
<i>Plus we got velvet revolver
out of it</i>

05:50.484 --> 05:52.484
<i>and those guys fucking rule.</i>

05:52.486 --> 05:54.252
<i>So it could be worse.</i>

05:54.254 --> 05:56.355
<i>Guns n' roses is happy.
I'm happy.</i>

05:56.357 --> 05:58.423
<i>Harry will be happy.
Christine is a bitch.</i>

05:58.425 --> 06:00.525
<i>And, hey, GNR kind of
got back together.</i>

06:00.527 --> 06:02.194
<i>Anything is possible.</i>

06:02.196 --> 06:04.229
<i>The kids will be all right.</i>

06:04.231 --> 06:05.330
<i>That's all I'm saying.</i>

06:16.142 --> 06:17.376
Ooh.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.585
Oh, fuck.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.553
Fuck.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.555
Fuck!

06:30.923 --> 06:32.791
Fuck.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.493
Fuck!

06:36.663 --> 06:38.296
<i>Okay, that is it
for the wedding.</i>

06:38.298 --> 06:39.464
<i>Thank you guys so much.</i>

06:39.466 --> 06:42.567
<i>Um, I will see you
at the next one.</i>

06:45.772 --> 06:47.572
"To Harry and Christine,

06:47.574 --> 06:51.143
"may you share the most romantic of
meals together over these dishes.

06:52.011 --> 06:53.545
"Love Joey and Britney."

06:54.647 --> 06:56.481
That's like, really nice.

06:57.116 --> 06:58.817
Yeah.

06:59.452 --> 07:01.219
Pull!

07:04.724 --> 07:06.825
Dude, in all fairness,

07:06.827 --> 07:09.828
there are <i> game of thrones</i> weddings that
were less bloody than yours today.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.797
- Not really funny.
- But look at it on the bright side.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.665
At least you found out
before you married her.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.333
Yeah, five minutes before.

07:15.335 --> 07:16.802
Yeah, that's
still before though.

07:16.804 --> 07:16.802
I mean, otherwise

07:16.804 --> 07:21.039
you would have been having sloppy seconds
on your own wedding night, dude.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.374
Also not funny.

07:22.376 --> 07:24.876
Uh, excuse me?

07:26.446 --> 07:27.779
Yeah, hey.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.615
Uh, we're not really sure
what you want us to do here.

07:30.617 --> 07:34.219
- Yeah, so I think we're just going to, um, go.
- Take off.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.455
No, no, please stay.
Everything's fine.

07:36.457 --> 07:37.589
I already paid you guys.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.758
If he wants you to stay
then you fucking stay.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.861
Okay? He had a shit day,
he almost married a skank

07:42.863 --> 07:45.230
and he's a prince amongst men!
It's his wedding night!

07:45.232 --> 07:46.798
And this is
the wedding reception

07:46.800 --> 07:48.967
but it's not a wedding reception
without a wedding band.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.303
It's not a wedding reception
without a wedding.

07:51.305 --> 07:51.303
Psycho.

07:51.305 --> 07:54.506
Please don't make me write you
guys a bad review on yelp.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.775
Oh, he yelps like a maniac!

07:56.777 --> 07:59.377
He's like an angry mama
on that thing!

07:59.379 --> 08:00.512
Okay...

08:00.514 --> 08:01.680
Play a song.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.448
- One song!
- Thank you.

08:04.785 --> 08:05.917
- That was a lot.
- Had to get my point across.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.352
Sure. Anyway, dude,

08:07.354 --> 08:09.321
this could be
a blessing in disguise.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.890
Look at all our married friends.
What do they have in common?

08:11.892 --> 08:13.191
That they're all married?

08:13.193 --> 08:14.392
They're in captivity!

08:14.394 --> 08:14.392
That's what marriage is.

08:14.394 --> 08:18.897
They have that same glazed-over
look that lions at the zoo have.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.999
You know why you've never
heard a lion at the zoo roar?

08:21.001 --> 08:23.335
Because I'm a grown man
and I don't go to the zoo?

08:23.337 --> 08:25.237
Okay, I'm a grown man and I
go to the zoo all the time.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.805
- Is there something weird about it?
- It's kind of weird.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.107
I got an annual pass.
What, am I not gonna use it?

08:29.109 --> 08:30.208
That's ridiculous!

08:30.210 --> 08:32.143
Does your lion metaphor
have a point?

08:32.145 --> 08:34.044
You never hear lions
roar at the zoo

08:34.047 --> 08:36.914
because you need
fucking balls to roar, man!

08:44.224 --> 08:46.224
- They're good.
- Yeah, like, really good.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.659
Can I ask you a question?

08:47.661 --> 08:48.960
Shoot.

08:49.762 --> 08:51.763
How did we get here, man?

08:51.765 --> 08:54.399
Well, my hillbilly cousin gave
me this gun as a wedding present

08:54.401 --> 08:57.369
and now we're using it to destroy
all the other wedding presents.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.170
No, not here...

08:59.172 --> 09:00.338
Man, how did we get here

09:00.907 --> 09:02.107
in life?

09:02.109 --> 09:03.608
How could you stay with
someone so long,

09:03.610 --> 09:05.744
let alone almost marry them,

09:05.746 --> 09:07.712
when the whole time
you guys were together

09:07.714 --> 09:09.314
she treated you so...

09:09.316 --> 09:11.616
I don't know what the word...
'Cause I don't want to offend you,

09:11.618 --> 09:13.051
because you're
a fragile guy right now.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.333
What is the word
I'm looking for?

09:14.987 --> 09:16.421
- Cold?
- Cunty.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.123
Careful.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.591
I don't know, man.

09:19.593 --> 09:23.061
When you're in something, you only
see what you want to see, right?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.330
And I saw the girl that
I was supposed to marry.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.232
On paper she was perfect.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.074
I mean, so was Bitcoin
when you think about it.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.605
You never suspected this?

09:33.607 --> 09:35.173
No, actually,
I didn't see this coming.

09:35.175 --> 09:38.343
I totally thought this would be
more of a murder-suicide situation.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.478
Yeah. Wait, what?

09:40.480 --> 09:43.248
Oh, she was going to kill you,
dude. That's for sure.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.083
But then I like to think
in my fantasy world,

09:45.085 --> 09:46.518
she would at least
have the courage

09:46.520 --> 09:48.720
to turn the gun
on herself afterwards.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.755
Is this the shit
you actually think about?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.317
I know, right? It's weird.

09:55.295 --> 09:58.196
Okay, do you guys know real songs
at all or do you just eavesdrop?

09:58.198 --> 09:59.631
She checked all the boxes.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.067
Oh this one, okay. Let's hear 'em.
Okay.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.169
Number one, she had a good job.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.604
You paid for everything!

10:05.606 --> 10:08.073
- She's pretty...
- She never fucked you, so who cares?

10:08.075 --> 10:09.674
She comes from
a really good family.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.443
Dude, her dad
called me the n-word.

10:11.944 --> 10:11.943
We had a plan.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.647
Harry, I know you have plans.
You fucking love plans.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.683
But you need to realize
that plan sucked.

10:18.685 --> 10:22.821
If you felt this way, why is this the
first time I'm hearing about it?

10:22.823 --> 10:24.656
Hey, what do you think
about Christine?

10:24.658 --> 10:26.591
She's cool, right?

10:26.593 --> 10:30.128
No, dude. She fucking sucks.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.063
Anyway, do not
propose to Christine, man.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.832
She fucking sucks.

10:36.202 --> 10:37.569
What?

10:37.571 --> 10:39.437
Your fiancee fucking sucks, man.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.040
I don't know, man,
I guess there was

10:42.042 --> 10:44.075
just never a good time
to bring it up.

10:48.748 --> 10:53.251
That's probably the flight Christine and I
were supposed to go on for our honeymoon.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.986
What island were you guys
going to? I forgot.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.888
Rancho Para.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.156
Supposed to be amazing.

10:59.692 --> 11:02.060
Dude, let's go!

11:02.062 --> 11:04.262
Just missed the flight.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.630
Yeah, but you
canceled the hotel?

11:05.632 --> 11:07.265
No, I couldn't.
It was too close to check-in.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.401
- I'm just going to have to eat it.
- No, you don't.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.302
Not if you and me go!

11:11.304 --> 11:13.371
- What, you and me?
- Yeah!

11:13.373 --> 11:14.739
How would we even get there?

11:14.741 --> 11:15.807
Dude, I got a guy.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.208
- You got a guy?
- I got a guy.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.310
What does that even mean?
You're always so vague.

11:19.312 --> 11:19.310
It means I know a guy.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.914
He runs shuttles back and forth
to the islands for my company.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.817
I'll hop on as a "business
trip" and you ride for free.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.653
You're my best friend, I have no
idea what you do for a living.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.922
Doesn't matter! You've got
your bags packed, right?

11:30.924 --> 11:33.491
- Yeah.
- So let's go, man, this is gonna be fucking awesome!

11:33.493 --> 11:35.694
Dude, fuck your honeymoon.
That was going to suck.

11:35.696 --> 11:36.761
This is you and me going out.

11:36.763 --> 11:38.897
It's not a honeymoon.
This is like, uh...

11:38.899 --> 11:40.665
Dude, this is a fucking bro-moon.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.435
I think "Homiemoon" is funnier.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.070
Yeah, see, look, it is funnier.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.238
That's how excited you are,
you're making puns!

11:47.240 --> 11:49.674
I'm going to use Homiemoon,
that's fucking hilarious!

11:49.676 --> 11:52.210
- It's not that exciting.
- You're so excited for this Homiemoon.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.344
Dude, we've got to
get out of here.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.679
Look at how fucking
depressing this place is.

11:54.681 --> 11:57.115
It's like the
Limp Bizkit reunion tour.

11:57.117 --> 11:57.115
Hey, man, we had
fun at that show.

11:57.117 --> 12:01.986
We had a great time but the crowd wasn't
into it and it took me out, personally.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.321
I don't know.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.003
Maybe I should just
go in to work tomorrow.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.593
Fuck you, man. I'm going
to fucking kill you.

12:08.595 --> 12:08.593
Are you kidding?

12:08.595 --> 12:12.997
You're going to do what you think
you're supposed to do, again.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.500
Look at what doing what you're
supposed to do did to you today.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.168
You almost married a whore!

12:17.170 --> 12:19.137
Hey, come on, man,
it still hurts.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.605
I know, I'm sorry.
I get excited.

12:20.607 --> 12:21.873
I forget that you're fragile.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.308
I love you.
Come here, my baby boy.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.542
I'm sorry I hurt
your feelings just then.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.377
But don't worry, this is going
to be a fun-ass Homiemoon.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.512
Okay, don't overuse it.

12:30.851 --> 12:31.851
Thanks, dude.

12:34.688 --> 12:36.888
You guys are wonderful, actually,
I was wrong about you.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.891
Where are we going?

12:39.893 --> 12:41.993
I told you, dude, gate z-98.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.528
Z? I see A and B.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.196
Ah, perfect timing. Give me that.
Give me that.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.699
You got it from the closet
we don't talk about, right?

12:47.701 --> 12:50.835
Cool, this is going into my file.
Get out of here.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.371
- What was that?
- It was one of my interns. I had him get my go bag.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.407
- How many interns do you have?
- Seven.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.909
Can you and I
talk about this closet?

13:04.650 --> 13:05.917
So is this it?

13:05.919 --> 13:08.086
Well, all the signs say gate z.

13:09.588 --> 13:11.422
- Who's this guy?
- Oh, that's Mike.

13:11.424 --> 13:12.857
Mike?

13:12.859 --> 13:14.225
Yeah, well his friends
call him corn

13:14.227 --> 13:15.860
on account of he tells
really lame jokes

13:15.862 --> 13:17.095
but he's a hell
of a poker player

13:17.097 --> 13:18.463
and really good at disc golf,

13:18.465 --> 13:20.565
despite the fact that he lost
half of his index finger

13:20.567 --> 13:22.367
in a thrashing machine
accident when he was nine.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.668
It's a real bummer but

13:23.670 --> 13:24.936
he's found a way to adapt.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.037
How do you know all this?

13:26.039 --> 13:27.172
I don't know all that, Harry!

13:27.174 --> 13:28.306
You're asking a ton
of questions, okay?

13:28.308 --> 13:29.474
I don't know everything
about everybody.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.436
That's clearly just a homeless guy.
Where'd he go?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.880
Who... who are you?
Who sent you?

13:35.882 --> 13:38.249
How long was I there?
Did Miguel send you?

13:38.251 --> 13:39.651
I don't know a Miguel.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.987
Shh! That's exactly what
Miguel would want you to say.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.923
We're just trying to get
to Rancho para.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.591
I'm looking for
a guy named Randy.

13:48.227 --> 13:49.527
Bowie?

13:49.529 --> 13:50.662
- Randy? Hey!
- Hey!

13:50.664 --> 13:52.397
All right.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.598
Randy!

13:53.600 --> 13:54.766
- Hey!
- Hey!

13:54.768 --> 13:56.367
And you must be Harry.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.571
- Yeah.
- Ah, the guy who almost married the town jizz mop.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.408
Don't blame me,
you know I like to gossip.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.876
Hey, don't sweat it.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.945
At least you two
found each other.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.580
And it wouldn't have happened
without her.

14:08.582 --> 14:10.181
That's the most important thing.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.717
- Wait, what do you think that this is?
- Yeah?

14:12.719 --> 14:15.420
Oh, nothing, nothing.
Just two best friends

14:15.422 --> 14:17.288
going on a trip for two together

14:17.290 --> 14:18.823
to a tropical paradise

14:18.825 --> 14:20.525
- with matching tuxes.
- Oh, shit.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.660
I actually think we look bad-ass.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.596
We look like Sommeliers.

14:24.598 --> 14:26.164
Follow me, guys. Come on.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.732
Why are you talking about
west African pirates?

14:27.734 --> 14:27.732
We look like butlers.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.935
Yeah, Geoffrey from <i> the fresh
prince</i> fucking rules, it's fine.

14:33.406 --> 14:34.739
<i>Sun-kissed airlines</i>

14:34.741 --> 14:35.940
<i>would like to

15:06.206 --> 15:07.772
Okay, what's up?
Can I help y'all?

15:09.141 --> 15:11.743
- We're the only two people here.
- Yeah.

15:13.612 --> 15:15.346
Come on, man,
I'm just messing with y'all.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.648
Come on, you guys.

15:16.650 --> 15:17.815
- Oh, that was...
- You guys...

15:17.817 --> 15:18.917
You were joking.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.118
- Because I thought...
- Ah!

15:20.120 --> 15:21.786
It's funny looking back,
but at the time

15:21.788 --> 15:23.087
- I did not...
- It was pretty brutal.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.456
- Yeah.
- Anyways, the more important thing is

15:25.458 --> 15:27.191
let's get you two
love birds in the air.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.893
Right this way, gentlemen.

15:28.895 --> 15:31.496
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Do what?

15:31.498 --> 15:33.665
I wouldn't trust this guy
with my dry cleaning.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.833
We're going to let him
fly a plane that we're in?

15:35.835 --> 15:37.435
Harry, fucking relax, okay?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.804
Literally no one has ever
died in a plane crash.

15:39.806 --> 15:42.407
What are you talking about?
JFK Jr.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.442
- John Denver. Aaliyah.
- Okay, three.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.111
Three people in the history of
aviation, that's pretty good, Harry.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.513
I think you should
fact-check that.

15:48.515 --> 15:49.995
Hey, Randy,
you ever crash this thing?

15:51.183 --> 15:52.684
Yeah.

15:52.686 --> 15:53.885
And look at him,
he's doing great.

15:53.887 --> 15:53.885
Hey, guys, guys.

15:53.887 --> 15:57.722
I've got two parachutes and a
flotation device. We're good.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.657
See? We're good!

15:59.659 --> 16:02.660
I like you, Randy.
I like you a bunch.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.362
I got dibs on the parachute.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.931
All right, the meal on today's
flight is shut the hell up

16:06.933 --> 16:10.668
and the in-flight movie is <i> strap
on and hold on to your dicks.</i>

16:10.670 --> 16:13.104
Or each other's.
Whatever you're into.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.773
Could you play the
movie <i> alive?</i> That'd be funny.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.942
All right, boys, we are all set

16:17.944 --> 16:19.777
and ready to go.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.146
It's like a sophisticated
pinball machine, right?

16:22.148 --> 16:24.849
Uh, tower, this is
Stroker Ace-six-nine,

16:24.851 --> 16:26.184
ready for takeoff.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.119
Now you've just got to
get out there and push.

16:29.221 --> 16:31.055
You're just fucking
with us, right?

16:33.259 --> 16:34.659
You're catching on, grasshopper.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.194
That's pretty good.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.261
That's pretty good.

16:54.246 --> 16:55.646
Okay, now I'm not.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.768
You're going to have to
really get out there and push.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.651
I have a hard time reading you.

17:30.082 --> 17:31.649
That was a surprisingly
smooth flight.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.885
Yeah.
Huh? What?

17:33.887 --> 17:36.521
He said that that was a surprisingly
smooth flight, Randy, it was great.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.223
Come on, guys, we all know
I'm not allowed to fly.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.360
No. Nope, we did
not know that, Randy.

17:42.362 --> 17:45.296
If you Google me it says,
"don't let him fly."

17:46.465 --> 17:49.534
Okay, well, looks like
we're here. Thanks again.

17:55.207 --> 17:57.175
Oh, shit.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.010
On behalf of everyone here

17:59.012 --> 18:00.711
at the trade-winds island resort,

18:00.713 --> 18:02.580
it is my pleasure to say to you

18:02.582 --> 18:05.316
welcome to Rancho para

18:05.318 --> 18:07.552
and happy honeymoon Mr. and...

18:09.088 --> 18:10.288
Nice!

18:13.725 --> 18:17.095
- Mr. and Mr. Fluder.
- Oh, uh...

18:17.097 --> 18:19.163
No, no, no. Not Mr. and Mr.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.966
Well, I mean, we are both misters.
I'm a boy so it's fine.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.968
A lover's quarrel already?

18:23.970 --> 18:25.503
This is supposed
to be the honeymoon.

18:25.505 --> 18:26.571
- Don't worry...
- Hey!

18:26.573 --> 18:28.973
Nothing a few days
in paradise won't cure.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.374
No, you don't understand.

18:30.376 --> 18:31.442
No bags?

18:31.444 --> 18:31.442
- No, we have bags.
- Yeah, we have bags.

18:31.444 --> 18:35.746
I must say, you two are doing
your honeymoon properly.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.715
Should I have all your
meals sent to your room?

18:37.717 --> 18:39.250
Double the maid service?

18:39.252 --> 18:40.685
I don't know what that means.

18:40.687 --> 18:40.685
I know what that means.

18:40.687 --> 18:44.822
Did you forget our bags? We're the
only two people on the plane.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.358
What? No! I know exactly
where your bags are.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.601
Hey, you guys enjoy
your honeymoon, all right?

18:56.603 --> 18:58.136
You guys make a cute couple.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.638
- What about my toiletries?
- Dude, who cares? Come on, let's go.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.473
- Hey.
- Hello.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.275
The ultimate
honeymoon experience.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.943
Dude, I can tell, man.
This thing rules.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.912
I feel like
fucking Beyonce right now.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.380
Does that make me Jay z?

19:11.416 --> 19:12.550
I don't know who that is.

19:25.264 --> 19:28.032
USA! USA!

19:51.224 --> 19:53.124
As you can see,
we've taken great pains

19:53.126 --> 19:55.526
to ensure that your room
and your entire stay

19:55.528 --> 19:58.029
caters to your every desire.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.932
If you need anything
your wish is my command.

20:01.433 --> 20:02.500
Good day, gentlemen.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.335
Good day.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.937
That guy talked
like a genie, huh?

20:06.705 --> 20:07.905
Yeah.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.774
All right.
What do you wanna do now?

20:10.309 --> 20:11.876
You mean after we fuck?

20:11.878 --> 20:14.779
Obviously, yeah. I mean, we have to fuck.
It would be rude not to.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.013
- Let's get a drink.
- Okay.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.450
It's just so wonderful.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.919
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.387
Look how tropical
this shit is, man.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.923
- Mmm.
- Fuckin', who is getting whiskey in paradise?

20:25.925 --> 20:26.991
Get tropical with me.

20:27.693 --> 20:28.859
Not feeling very tropical.

20:29.361 --> 20:31.062
Ooh, that's good.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.897
That's good.

20:32.899 --> 20:36.567
When I pictured this,
I didn't exactly picture this.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.570
Look, I know she-who-shall-not-be-named
fucking sucks, but still.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.105
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

20:41.107 --> 20:44.041
I forgot why I was here.
Take care of my buddy.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.244
I'm gonna go get us the three WS.
How's that sound?

20:46.246 --> 20:48.412
- Huh?
- Weed, women...

20:49.915 --> 20:51.682
Fuck. Should've been two WS.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.884
I'm gonna go do that, then.
I'm gonna get us the two WS.

20:55.220 --> 20:56.654
Third one could've been whiskey.

21:00.959 --> 21:02.560
Watermelon's the third one.

21:14.339 --> 21:15.406
Oh yeah.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.676
Hey. How's it going?

21:19.478 --> 21:21.612
All at once
and at the same time.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.680
Okay.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.851
Did you order caviar
or diamonds or something?

21:27.519 --> 21:29.620
Oh, you see him too, huh?

21:29.622 --> 21:31.155
Okay, good.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.124
Hello, time traveler.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.325
Come, sit.

21:35.794 --> 21:36.894
I'm bowie.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.863
Hi, bowie.

21:38.865 --> 21:41.165
Are you from
<i>dancing with the stars?</i>

21:41.167 --> 21:42.933
No, no. I'm not.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.268
But I think that show's great.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.238
Um...

21:47.240 --> 21:48.639
I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

21:48.641 --> 21:52.510
Uh, I don't wanna, assume too much
that it might offend you guys,

21:52.512 --> 21:57.248
but you just seem like
the sort that might know this.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.483
You guys might be able to help me out.
I'm not from around here,

21:59.485 --> 22:03.354
and if someone from not around
here was looking to, maybe,

22:03.356 --> 22:07.792
elevate themselves to, like, the
level you guys seem to be on...

22:08.460 --> 22:09.527
You know what I...

22:09.529 --> 22:11.595
You know what I mean?

22:18.837 --> 22:22.173
You're sayin' an awful lot
of words right now, man.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.175
Are you a narc?

22:24.543 --> 22:27.978
Oh, stop teasing him.
We're just fuckin' with you.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.046
We're just fuckin' with you.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.015
Our level, our level.
Sure, sure, sure.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.817
Look. All you gotta do, look.

22:32.819 --> 22:35.086
You just gotta
eat this bag of mushrooms,

22:36.188 --> 22:38.356
and smoke this bag of weed.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.124
Okay.

22:40.126 --> 22:43.994
Every day for 20 years.

22:44.830 --> 22:45.963
Get out... you...

22:45.965 --> 22:48.733
You do that, and you
might be able to, like,

22:48.735 --> 22:51.969
smell the orbit that we're
working with, you know?

22:53.338 --> 22:56.640
I mean, yeah, it... It would get you close.
It would get you close.

22:56.642 --> 22:57.842
It's true.

22:57.844 --> 23:00.144
I once did peyote
with a leprechaun...

23:00.146 --> 23:02.680
Could've been
a well-dressed armadillo.

23:02.682 --> 23:06.016
Either way, we both peaked at the
same time, so it was all good.

23:06.018 --> 23:09.787
Yeah, I mean, you know, you gotta
start somewhere, right? So...

23:09.789 --> 23:11.355
Yeah, here.

23:11.357 --> 23:13.224
Oh, man.

23:13.226 --> 23:14.291
What do I owe you?

23:14.293 --> 23:15.693
That's from the earth, man.

23:15.695 --> 23:18.195
Who am I to charge for nature's bounty?
You know it's, uh...

23:18.197 --> 23:20.164
That'd be like charging
for water, you know?

23:20.166 --> 23:21.298
They do charge you for water.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.033
You shut the fuck up, Richard!

23:23.035 --> 23:25.236
That's not a funny joke,
and I told you that.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.238
What's wrong with you?

23:27.240 --> 23:28.806
Having a little shindig
by the casino, later, man.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.808
You should stop by, man.
It's gonna be fun, you know.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.711
Well, real mellow, you know.
Nothing formal, although...

23:33.713 --> 23:36.414
Well, that sounds great. I'm just
here with my buddy, so I gotta...

23:36.416 --> 23:37.748
We love buddies.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.650
Yeah, man. The more the merrier.
That's what I say.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.318
Shit. Bring him, you know.
It's easy to find.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.554
You just gotta cut through
the woods right down...

23:45.257 --> 23:47.324
There. Right down there,
and, uh...

23:47.326 --> 23:49.126
It's off the beaten path,
but you can't miss it, man.

23:49.128 --> 23:49.126
It's right down there,
you'll see it.

23:49.128 --> 23:52.630
All right, man. Well, I'm so
glad I ran into you guys.

23:52.632 --> 23:55.299
I appreciate everything. This is so cool.
Thank you very much.

23:55.301 --> 23:57.134
Hey, you wanna...

23:57.136 --> 23:58.969
You know? Just a little toke
for the road?

23:58.971 --> 24:01.038
- Yeah. Yeah. Course.
- There you go.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.274
That's gonna put some fuzz
on your peaches, you know.

24:03.276 --> 24:04.542
This is fine, here?

24:04.544 --> 24:06.377
- Yeah, never got caught.
- I hope so, man.

24:06.379 --> 24:07.812
We been doin' it for years.

24:10.382 --> 24:13.417
Oh, fuck, dude, fuck.

24:13.419 --> 24:17.054
Oh, come on, man. That's
the breakfast blend, man.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.390
That's the shit I smoke
to stop being high.

24:19.392 --> 24:20.958
- Oh, god.
- Come on, man.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.193
Look at him go.

24:22.195 --> 24:23.427
I'm gonna
do one more for the road.

24:23.429 --> 24:24.528
Okay, you go for that.

24:24.530 --> 24:25.896
You gotta try
everything twice, yeah.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.498
Ah, there we go.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.966
Similar results.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.669
This guy's funny.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.671
Well, you guys are cool.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.842
Come tonight. Don't forget
to bring your friends.

24:39.878 --> 24:41.645
- I like him.
- Yeah, yeah.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.013
Looked like a Butler.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.682
But he didn't bring us anything.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.183
- Yeah.
- Butlers usually bring you something.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.852
- He's not good at his job?
- No.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.387
What the fuck?

25:07.272 --> 25:09.640
'Sup? That feels so
weird, huh.

25:09.642 --> 25:11.342
Oh, my god!

25:11.344 --> 25:12.710
Watch where
you're going, asshole.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.446
I'm looking for an armadillo.

25:15.448 --> 25:19.049
I'm sorry. Did you just say
you're looking for an armadillo?

25:19.051 --> 25:21.118
Oh, he lost his armadillo.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.153
Oh, yeah? Well, he's about to
lose the contents of his nut sack

25:23.155 --> 25:25.589
if I don't have another drink
in my hand by then.

25:25.591 --> 25:27.391
Here, just have mine.
I haven't even taken a sip.

25:27.393 --> 25:28.492
No, it's fine.

25:28.494 --> 25:29.660
"Lose the contents
of his nut sack?"

25:29.662 --> 25:31.428
Are you gonna hurt him
or blow him?

25:31.430 --> 25:32.830
Oh yeah. Good, Colette.

25:32.832 --> 25:35.533
'Cause I suck every guy's dick
who spills a drink on me. Nice.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.968
I mean, he's wearing a tuxedo
in 90 degree weather.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.770
He's obviously a masochist.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.705
Rip off his nuts.
I bet he'd like it.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.308
Try and remember the last place
that you saw your armadillo.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.343
Ooh, I know.
Check your other hand.

25:46.345 --> 25:49.880
I can't tell you how many times I've lost
something and ended up finding it there.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.048
Well, what do you say, asshole?

25:51.050 --> 25:51.048
You wanna step outta the way
and apologize?

25:51.050 --> 25:54.852
You want me to shove my foot so far
up your ass I can wear you as pants?

25:55.620 --> 25:56.720
Shut up, you stupid.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.090
Did he just call me stupid?

26:00.092 --> 26:01.425
Shut up, you stupid.

26:01.427 --> 26:03.227
Look at you, you so dumb.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.662
Oh, no.

26:04.664 --> 26:05.896
I'm gonna kick this guy's
dick off, right now.

26:05.898 --> 26:06.997
Wait, wait, wait.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.399
Wait, wait. I smell weed.

26:08.401 --> 26:09.466
Do you have weed?

26:11.304 --> 26:12.836
Oh, that's cool.

26:15.774 --> 26:16.874
Harry.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.342
I'm in sad mode.

26:18.344 --> 26:19.743
Entering anger mode.

26:19.745 --> 26:20.844
Harry.

26:23.114 --> 26:25.683
Dude, I'm so high, too.

26:27.352 --> 26:29.053
Hello.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.321
All right. Come on.
Let's do this.

26:30.323 --> 26:31.889
Bring the sad one.

26:33.291 --> 26:34.358
That's you.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.530
I know!

26:39.532 --> 26:41.198
Okay.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.601
I didn't get watermelon.
That's the only one I forgot.

26:53.411 --> 26:54.845
This is your boat?

26:54.847 --> 26:56.113
It's awesome.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.815
Okay, first of all,
it's not a boat.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.016
It's a yacht, asshole.

26:59.985 --> 27:01.552
It's okay, guys.
They're with me.

27:05.857 --> 27:07.925
Shoes off, guys. Let's go.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.693
All right. Whatever.

27:10.395 --> 27:11.762
Fucking rules.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.665
You're terrifying.

27:20.872 --> 27:22.006
- Dude.
- Wow.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.540
This boat is dope.

27:23.542 --> 27:25.075
Mmm, thank you.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.143
Speaking of which,

27:26.945 --> 27:28.345
let's see it.

27:28.347 --> 27:28.345
- What?
- Huh?

27:28.347 --> 27:31.482
Come on. Isn't that what you came here for?
Whip it out.

27:32.183 --> 27:33.250
Oh.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.919
No, but...

27:35.921 --> 27:37.855
- Uh, it's not why we came here...
- Uh...

27:37.857 --> 27:39.757
but it's very cool of you
to start with this.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.325
- Oh, that's not cool.
- Oh, my god.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.360
No, not your dick. The weed.

27:43.928 --> 27:45.029
Oh, what?

27:45.031 --> 27:46.563
- Yeah, I know.
- God!

27:47.332 --> 27:48.766
I was kidding.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.267
Jesus Christ.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.702
Heard of a joke?

27:51.704 --> 27:53.971
- Gross.
- So, I'm Harry.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.072
I'm Angela.

27:55.074 --> 27:56.507
Nice to meet you.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.976
- This is Beatrice over here.
- Hey.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.644
You can call me Bea.

28:00.646 --> 28:02.413
Everyone does.
I don't force them.

28:02.415 --> 28:04.114
That's Johanna over there.

28:04.883 --> 28:06.483
- Don't look at me.
- Okay.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.352
Hi, I'm Tiffani and, uh...

28:08.953 --> 28:10.154
It's really hot.

28:11.189 --> 28:14.458
Oh. Ah, that's better.

28:14.460 --> 28:17.027
Yeah. It... good call.
It is so hot.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.429
It's... yup.

28:20.732 --> 28:22.499
I'm Colette. Hi.

28:23.935 --> 28:25.035
Hi.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.540
I'm bowie.

28:30.141 --> 28:32.209
That's my weed.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.578
So, you guys probably think
I'm pretty cool.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.347
Do you have Asperger's?

28:37.349 --> 28:40.350
I don't think so.
Unless you're into it.

28:45.790 --> 28:49.359
So, what brings you ladies
to the islands?

28:49.361 --> 28:50.461
The boat does.

28:50.463 --> 28:50.461
My husband.

28:50.463 --> 28:53.497
He's always traveling here and
there for work, you know,

28:53.499 --> 28:55.933
so I said, "you gotta figure out
a way to bring us with you."

28:55.935 --> 28:58.068
What does your husband do?

28:58.070 --> 29:00.304
Oh, little bit of this,
little bit of that, you know.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.172
Buys me yachts to keep me happy.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.676
So I can hang out
with my girls and party.

29:05.678 --> 29:07.344
He sounds cool.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.046
Ooh, this weed
is really relaxing.

29:09.048 --> 29:11.248
Right?
I love smoking weed.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.484
So relaxing.

29:13.486 --> 29:14.726
Basically take a nap right now.

29:17.956 --> 29:21.125
Might wanna take it easy on that.
You don't wanna get paranoid.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.560
You need to take it easy,
tux-o. Okay?

29:23.562 --> 29:25.395
I'm not paranoid.
You're paranoid.

29:25.397 --> 29:25.395
- Shut up.
- It's okay.

29:25.397 --> 29:30.267
Actually, that ridiculous
marijuana-causing-paranoia thing? That's a myth.

29:30.269 --> 29:30.267
It just lowers your inhibitions,

29:30.269 --> 29:33.537
and then you become a
heightened version of yourself.

29:33.539 --> 29:36.039
So if you're, like, really
happy, you're extra happy.

29:36.908 --> 29:38.976
If you're a crazy psycho weirdo,

29:39.911 --> 29:41.578
you're that.

29:41.580 --> 29:42.980
Lemme guess. Psychiatrist?

29:43.515 --> 29:44.915
Psychoanalyst.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.017
She said anal. That's funny.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.119
Bowie,

29:49.121 --> 29:50.387
why are you here?

29:50.389 --> 29:52.055
Actually,
it's a pretty crazy story.

29:52.057 --> 29:53.857
Yesterday, I'm with Harry...

29:53.859 --> 29:58.529
We're masseuse... Massages?
Massage. Massages.

29:58.531 --> 29:59.730
Masseuses?

29:59.732 --> 30:01.331
You mean massage therapists?

30:01.333 --> 30:03.600
Yeah. I actually consider myself

30:03.602 --> 30:05.836
a massage, uh, wizard.

30:06.771 --> 30:09.673
It's magic what I can do
with just these.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.843
It sounds like magic.

30:12.845 --> 30:16.246
Yeah. And we are here for
the annual awards ceremony.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.381
Oh!

30:17.849 --> 30:18.949
The Handies.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.818
- Congratulations.
- Fuck, yeah. Thank you.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.120
That would explain the tuxedos.

30:23.122 --> 30:25.789
No, not really,
but please, go on.

30:25.791 --> 30:27.057
You're nominated for an award.

30:27.059 --> 30:30.127
Well, I'm nominated
for best technique,

30:30.129 --> 30:32.596
and bowie's nominated
for best...

30:32.598 --> 30:33.864
Best oral.

30:33.866 --> 30:33.864
- Sup?
- Gross.

30:33.866 --> 30:37.534
- Ew, that's disgusting.
- No, it's different in the massage community.

30:37.536 --> 30:40.237
It just means good
table-side, uh, banter.

30:40.239 --> 30:42.239
Uh, banter. So good.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.208
Oh, fuck! Jesus Christ.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.109
What happened? What is this?
What are you doing?

30:46.111 --> 30:47.344
Oh, my god. Get down.

30:50.915 --> 30:52.115
What the hell was that?

30:52.117 --> 30:54.017
Oh, shit. Fuck.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.185
Who cares?

30:55.187 --> 30:57.254
Oh, my god.
I thought that was my husband.

30:57.256 --> 30:57.254
Who's your husband?

30:57.256 --> 31:00.757
Not someone you want to catch
you with his wife in a hot tub.

31:01.726 --> 31:03.760
Oh, god.
I fuckin' ruined the weed.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.662
Shit. All of it.

31:05.664 --> 31:07.564
I'm sorry.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.299
Well, you know
what that means, boys.

31:11.269 --> 31:13.170
Just, kinda,
feel each other up, now?

31:13.938 --> 31:15.873
- Okay, buh-bye.
- Byes.

31:16.241 --> 31:17.307
Hey, um...

31:18.343 --> 31:19.910
Sorry.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.612
No, no. It's okay.

31:21.614 --> 31:23.013
This was, uh...

31:23.015 --> 31:25.682
I wanna say fun,
but it was more interesting.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.285
How do I feel like I know you?

31:29.654 --> 31:30.888
Oh, I don't know.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.890
I guess I just
have one of those faces.

31:32.892 --> 31:35.959
No. Yours is a face
I definitely wouldn't forget.

31:38.129 --> 31:39.396
Wow.

31:39.398 --> 31:45.435
That was, like, page one of the
douchebag pickup handbook, right there.

31:45.437 --> 31:49.039
I'll take shitty Justin Bieber
lyrics for $1,000, Alex.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.375
- I'll get outta here. You don't have to see me again.
- No, no, no, no.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.477
I really hope
I get to see you again.

31:54.846 --> 31:56.613
I hope you get to see...

31:57.315 --> 31:58.949
I mean...

31:58.951 --> 32:00.050
I think you know what I mean.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.118
Yes.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.352
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.454
- Okay, then. It's settled.
- Settled.

32:04.456 --> 32:05.555
Hey, tux-o.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.090
- Let's fucking go.
- I'm coming.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.659
I'm gonna go. Thank you.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.193
Coming. I'm high as shit, man.
Gotta get food.

32:10.195 --> 32:11.895
Don't embarrass me.

32:11.897 --> 32:14.464
It was nice to meet you,
tux-o.

32:14.466 --> 32:17.534
She called you tux-o.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.836
Massage therapist?
What the fuck was I thinking?

32:19.838 --> 32:21.371
I dunno, but it was genius.

32:21.373 --> 32:22.973
Did you have that one
loaded in the chamber,

32:22.975 --> 32:24.341
or was that just
off the top of your head, man?

32:24.343 --> 32:26.376
Nope, that was
right out of my ass.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.011
And when did you become
leisure suit Larry?

32:28.013 --> 32:31.481
Oh, I wish I was leisure suit Larry.
That guy's awesome.

32:31.483 --> 32:34.451
"Oh yeah. I'm nominated
for best oral, ha ha!

32:34.453 --> 32:36.553
"Let me finger-bang you
with my wizard hand."

32:36.555 --> 32:39.222
- That's not how I laugh.
- That's exactly how you sound, man.

32:39.224 --> 32:41.825
Either way, I never said "finger-bang
you with my magical wizard hands."

32:41.827 --> 32:43.226
Well, you might as well have.

32:43.228 --> 32:45.195
The shit you were saying back
there didn't even make sense.

32:45.197 --> 32:47.631
Harry, look around.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.266
We're in a <i> fast and the
furious</i> movie right now.

32:49.268 --> 32:50.968
Nothing has to make sense.

32:51.402 --> 32:52.636
Dude.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.137
This is the stripper flight.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.174
Okay. What's
a stripper flight?

32:57.176 --> 32:59.843
Stripper flight is this legendary
flight from Tampa to Vegas,

32:59.845 --> 32:59.843
filled with strippers.

32:59.845 --> 33:04.181
Because everyone knows the two meccas for
strip clubs are Tampa and Vegas, right?

33:04.183 --> 33:06.283
Oh. Yeah, I think that was
a question on my LSAT.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.819
So, all the best strippers
work both places.

33:08.821 --> 33:10.887
Tampa, weekdays.
Vegas, weekends.

33:10.889 --> 33:12.155
<i>There's this one flight.</i>

33:12.157 --> 33:14.157
<i>According to legend,
every Thursday night,</i>

33:14.159 --> 33:17.227
<i>the hottest strippers in Tampa
get on the same plane to Vegas.</i>

33:17.229 --> 33:20.630
<i>And Vegas is a 24-hour town, so
they get on that plane ready to go.</i>

33:20.632 --> 33:22.132
<i>You know, time is money.</i>

33:22.134 --> 33:22.132
<i>And you can't just, like,
buy a ticket.</i>

33:22.134 --> 33:26.703
<i>It's not like these flights are
advertised as the stripper flight.</i>

33:26.705 --> 33:28.872
<i>They're totally random
and unpredictable.</i>

33:28.874 --> 33:30.574
<i>Dude, just like strippers.</i>

33:30.576 --> 33:32.776
<i>But every now and then,
the stars align,</i>

33:32.778 --> 33:35.112
<i>and some lucky bastard
gets bumped off his flight,</i>

33:36.147 --> 33:39.349
<i>and finds himself
on the stripper flight.</i>

33:39.351 --> 33:41.318
<i>And if you ever end up
on the stripper flight,</i>

33:41.320 --> 33:45.122
<i>you owe it to yourself
to go balls out.</i>

33:45.205 --> 33:46.524
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

33:46.525 --> 33:50.394
<i>as you can see, the captain has
turned off the fasten seatbelt sign.</i>

33:50.396 --> 33:51.956
<i>You are now free
to get your freak on.</i>

34:12.250 --> 34:13.583
Yeah!

34:13.585 --> 34:15.752
Okay.
Not my most profound story...

34:15.754 --> 34:17.154
Yeah, but maybe your longest.

34:17.156 --> 34:18.822
But either way,
look at yesterday.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.157
You were this close
to marrying a woman

34:20.159 --> 34:21.658
who was
time-sharing her vagina,

34:21.659 --> 34:21.658
and look at today.

34:21.659 --> 34:26.096
You already spent the afternoon with a
bunch of banging-hot sorority chicks

34:26.098 --> 34:27.197
in a hot tub.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.099
Okay, dickhead.
You're 30 years old.

34:29.101 --> 34:30.766
So are they. They're just
called women, now.

34:30.768 --> 34:33.637
Either way. I bet there's gonna be
a bunch of hot sorority "women"

34:33.639 --> 34:35.705
at this dope house party
I'm about to take you to.

34:35.706 --> 34:37.607
Well, we're in the middle
of nowhere.

34:37.609 --> 34:37.607
We look like assholes.

34:37.609 --> 34:42.512
And this dope-ass house party is
definitely going to be a meth lab.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.281
I bet the party's this way.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.850
Oh, directly into the jungle?
Yeah, that makes sense.

34:52.857 --> 34:55.025
Nicest meth lab I've seen.

34:55.027 --> 34:56.460
How many meth labs
have you seen?

34:57.328 --> 34:58.662
Three.

34:58.664 --> 35:00.330
This is gonna be
fucking awesome.

35:04.735 --> 35:08.071
You know, takes a big man
not to say I told you so.

35:08.073 --> 35:09.406
Okay. Let's get it over with.

35:09.408 --> 35:11.141
Get what over with?

35:11.143 --> 35:13.143
- Just say it.
- What did you think I was gonna say?

35:13.145 --> 35:13.143
You're not gonna
trick me into saying it.

35:13.145 --> 35:16.279
- Trick you into saying what do you think?
- You're basically...

35:17.248 --> 35:19.516
Hello.
We're here for the party.

35:29.193 --> 35:30.827
Oh. Thank you.

35:32.096 --> 35:34.164
I hope they're serving food
at this party. I'm starving.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.399
Me too, man.
I'm doing mints right now.

35:36.401 --> 35:38.802
Oh. I haven't brushed my teeth
since yesterday,

35:38.804 --> 35:39.903
so two birds.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.239
Cool. Pre-meal, I guess.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.907
- Oh, baby. That sucks.
- Too big, it wouldn't work.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.269
Couldn't smoke it
at the same time.

35:46.278 --> 35:47.978
Guys, you made it.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.412
Like, I'm so glad
you got here, huh?

35:49.414 --> 35:50.547
So glad.

35:50.549 --> 35:51.681
I brought my friend, Harry.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.650
Oh, hi, friend Harry.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.319
Hey. So, you guys live here?

35:56.321 --> 35:56.319
This is our vacation home.
We just...

35:56.321 --> 36:00.657
We just come out here for one or
two months at a time when, uh...

36:00.659 --> 36:03.026
When Monte-Carlo's feeling
a little too chintzy.

36:03.028 --> 36:05.962
Yeah, Monte-Carlo. It's like
the Branson of the riviera.

36:05.964 --> 36:08.665
Yeah. Just gets...
It's too much sometimes.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.134
Lemme show you guys
around our little...

36:11.136 --> 36:12.435
Our little jungle abode.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.005
Have fun, boys.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.339
All right, eh. See ya.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.642
Hey, this place
fucking rules, dude.

36:18.644 --> 36:19.809
Oh, thanks, man. Thanks.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.444
- Hey, Marcel.
- Hello,<i> monsieur.</i>

36:21.446 --> 36:23.813
How're you doing?
This is my head chef, Marcel.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.282
Dude, you got a head chef?

36:25.284 --> 36:27.684
Marcel, these are my pals,
Harry and bowie.

36:27.686 --> 36:27.684
Pleasure to meet you.

36:27.686 --> 36:31.555
We stole him from one of those real
fancy restaurants over in Europe.

36:31.557 --> 36:33.657
You know, the kind where they
don't let you wear shorts,

36:33.659 --> 36:34.925
and you can't even
bring your own beer.

36:34.927 --> 36:36.593
One of those dumps, you know.

36:36.595 --> 36:37.894
Ugh, yeah.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.129
Cost me a fortune, man.

36:39.131 --> 36:43.166
This guy can make an omelet
you just wanna fuck.

36:43.168 --> 36:44.634
Hey, Kenny.
This place is amazing.

36:44.636 --> 36:47.404
I love how nothing matches.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.972
- Thanks, man. Thanks.
- Yeah, it's fun.

36:48.974 --> 36:48.972
- I like it.
- What do you do?

36:48.974 --> 36:52.576
Well, I like to think of myself
as an inventor, you know.

36:52.578 --> 36:55.412
Some of it's
alternative licensing.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.047
Like, have you heard of
the George foreman grill?

36:57.049 --> 36:59.316
- Oh, yeah. You came up with the George foreman grill?
- Dude. No way.

36:59.318 --> 37:02.152
No, no, no. There's a Larry Holmes
hot plate. Look at that guy.

37:02.154 --> 37:03.286
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:03.288 --> 37:04.621
Marcel's a wizard on that thing.

37:04.623 --> 37:06.056
Look, look. Out there.
You see out there?

37:06.058 --> 37:08.225
People under that, uh,
under the blanket,

37:08.227 --> 37:09.826
with all of the sleeves
cut out of it?

37:09.828 --> 37:11.394
- Well, I'll be. No way.
- No, no, no.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.563
That is a Squilt.
That is a Squilt.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.432
There's a trademark
on the other thing.

37:15.434 --> 37:16.566
Some lawsuits pending.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.268
If it is, uh,
agreeable with <i> monsieur,</i>

37:18.270 --> 37:19.936
- I started serving the Hors D'oeuvres.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:19.938 --> 37:22.606
We have a saffron-infused
lobster mini-cake,

37:22.608 --> 37:25.408
- served on a Jalapeño dill crouton bread.
- Ooh.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.611
- Mmm. That sounds really good.
- That sounds amazing.

37:27.613 --> 37:29.179
- Mmm-hmm.
- I mean, that's agreeable, yeah.

37:29.181 --> 37:30.680
- Know what else is agreeable, though?
- Hmm?

37:30.682 --> 37:33.116
Bagel bites. Ha ha, yeah, man.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.317
- Bagel bites,<i> monsieur?</i>
- Yeah.

37:34.319 --> 37:36.152
You know. It's the...
It's the...

37:36.154 --> 37:37.354
It's like a little pizza

37:37.356 --> 37:38.788
but it's on a bagel,

37:38.790 --> 37:40.190
and you just... you bite it.

37:40.192 --> 37:42.359
We got some in the freezer,
pop in the microwave.

37:42.361 --> 37:44.894
I tried to make my own.
Inventor.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.664
Uh, mini muffin munchers...
That's what I call 'em, but...

37:47.666 --> 37:49.866
Can't fuck with perfection, man.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.167
They nailed it.
They nailed it.

37:51.169 --> 37:53.603
But those lobster croutons
sound amazing.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.405
You can make the other things,
too, a couple of those.

37:55.407 --> 37:58.408
Bagel bites. Your culinary
wish is my command.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.612
<i>Gracias.</i>

38:03.381 --> 38:03.380
Dude, you speak that language?

38:03.382 --> 38:06.683
No, no. I just don't want him
to feel left out, you know.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.451
It's pretty, though.
Sounds so pretty.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.987
Can I show you what I really do for
a living, though? My true passion.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.555
- You wanna see it?
- Oh, fuck, yeah, Kenny.

38:12.557 --> 38:13.823
- You go check it out.
- Okay, come on. Come here.

38:13.825 --> 38:15.592
I can't wait to.
It's gonna be so rad.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.227
Mints.

38:29.273 --> 38:30.940
Hey.

38:30.942 --> 38:32.175
I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

38:32.177 --> 38:34.010
- Hi.
- What're you doing here?

38:34.012 --> 38:37.380
Oh, uh, yeah. I just, uh,
came from a night dive.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.182
If I didn't find these shoes
in the bottom of my bag,

38:39.184 --> 38:41.017
I'd be standing here
in flippers.

38:41.019 --> 38:42.085
You look great.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.020
Aw, thanks. You're so sweet.

38:44.022 --> 38:47.023
You look exactly the same.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.925
What? No.

38:48.927 --> 38:50.093
No, this is different.

38:51.629 --> 38:54.297
That was my beach tux.

38:54.299 --> 38:55.832
Oh, yeah. It's all right.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.500
Yeah.
This is my cocktail t-shirt.

38:58.269 --> 38:59.502
Obviously.

39:01.706 --> 39:05.141
This... this is my lab, huh.

39:05.143 --> 39:07.344
Fuckin' Harry was right.
Jesus...

39:08.547 --> 39:09.646
Kenny!

39:10.181 --> 39:11.681
You devil. What is this?

39:11.683 --> 39:13.249
Yeah, I know.

39:13.251 --> 39:16.686
Yeah. We're the premiere
manufacturer and retailer

39:16.688 --> 39:20.023
of alternatively-sized and
uniquely-shaped pleasure products

39:20.025 --> 39:20.023
- in the western hemisphere.
- Okay.

39:20.025 --> 39:24.394
Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm not trying to compete
with Japan. They're on another level.

39:24.396 --> 39:24.394
Yeah, they're the number ones?

39:24.396 --> 39:28.465
Yeah, they do all kinds of stuff with
real dolls and, like, fuck squids.

39:28.467 --> 39:31.234
Anyway, so yeah. Marthy
calls this my fuck factory.

39:31.236 --> 39:32.869
Dude. Uniquely-shaped,
alternatively-sized.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.804
All right. What is this?
What is this?

39:34.806 --> 39:36.206
Oh. Oh, this one here.
Okay, this guy.

39:36.208 --> 39:37.307
This is a top seller.

39:37.309 --> 39:38.942
Now, say you got a gal.
She's in the mood,

39:38.944 --> 39:40.910
but she has, like, a very, um,

39:40.912 --> 39:42.879
shallow, wide vagina.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.013
- Okay.
- It happens.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.548
- Yeah. No, no. I know.
- You know, we're all...

39:45.550 --> 39:48.251
It's the differences that
makes us, uh, a whole thing.

39:48.253 --> 39:49.719
Now, something like this.
Something like this.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.054
Look, this is gonna
brutalize her.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.056
This is gonna... this is gonna

39:53.058 --> 39:54.290
puncture a lung.
You know?

39:54.292 --> 39:55.992
This is like an NBA player

39:55.994 --> 39:57.127
diving into a kiddie pool.

39:57.129 --> 39:58.395
You can't deal with this.

39:58.397 --> 40:00.263
This is gonna hit
all the erogenous zones,

40:00.265 --> 40:02.665
but not go too deep
and, uh, cause discomfort.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.501
That's the little miss muff
right there.

40:04.503 --> 40:07.170
- Feel that, that's just, the consistency's there.
- Dude, they're the same.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.872
- Yeah, yeah. I know.
- This one, what is this one, Kenny?

40:08.874 --> 40:11.808
Okay, oh. This, this one,
this is our sidewinder.

40:11.810 --> 40:15.111
Uh, this is for, like, okay. You're a
guy, you're in the mood all the time.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.347
But you're more of a
boomerang than a bow staff.

40:17.349 --> 40:19.015
- Hmm.
- You know what I'm saying? Rhino.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.283
Rhino... that's you?

40:20.285 --> 40:21.551
Buddy.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.620
So that's gonna go
right on there,

40:23.622 --> 40:24.754
and it's gonna hit
all the spots...

40:24.756 --> 40:26.689
No, I know.
I can visualize it for sure.

40:26.691 --> 40:28.091
Dude, how do you
come up with this shit?

40:28.093 --> 40:29.559
This is, fucking, so smart.

40:29.561 --> 40:31.728
Well, I mean,
I've always been a tinkerer.

40:31.730 --> 40:31.728
You know, they've got
big and tall stores

40:31.730 --> 40:36.199
for clothes, they've got that. But,
uh, it's like the same concept,

40:36.201 --> 40:38.468
but I just applied it
to, uh, your fuck parts.

40:38.470 --> 40:39.836
Fucking genius.

40:39.838 --> 40:41.304
It's why I live in a mansion,
man.

40:42.506 --> 40:43.807
Kenny, is that
your product shot?

40:43.809 --> 40:46.009
Yeah, yeah, that's
Martha's idea, you know,

40:46.011 --> 40:46.009
we gotta get the brand
out there,

40:46.011 --> 40:50.447
she's like, "we gotta put a face
to the name of the company,"

40:50.449 --> 40:53.716
so we're trying to be the Billy Mays
of dildos, and everything, you know?

40:53.718 --> 40:54.784
Yeah, but he died, though.

40:55.186 --> 40:56.252
What?

40:58.889 --> 41:00.790
Mmm.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.527
To random encounters.

41:04.529 --> 41:08.832
So, I have a tiny confession
to make.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.801
- Okay.
- I knew I was going to see you here tonight.

41:11.803 --> 41:14.838
- You did?
- That's why I decided to cut my dive short

41:14.840 --> 41:16.473
and get all dressed up.

41:17.374 --> 41:18.842
How did you know
about the party?

41:18.844 --> 41:20.577
Oh, it's not that big an island.

41:20.579 --> 41:23.513
You ask the right people the right
questions you can find out anything.

41:23.515 --> 41:25.048
What else do I not
know about you?

41:25.850 --> 41:28.017
Oh, I am full of secrets...

41:29.653 --> 41:33.156
- Well, I have a tiny confession to make as well.
- Uh-oh.

41:33.158 --> 41:36.526
Things just got interesting.
Mmm, let me guess.

41:36.528 --> 41:37.760
You're a spy.

41:37.762 --> 41:37.760
Nope.

41:37.762 --> 41:41.297
The real Harry is just some guy
you left in a ditch somewhere?

41:41.299 --> 41:45.068
Wow, that took
a sharp left turn. No.

41:45.070 --> 41:47.871
Is serial killer
always your second go-to?

41:47.873 --> 41:49.839
I don't know why more people don't
ask that right off the bat.

41:49.841 --> 41:53.009
I mean, I think it's a pretty
important thing to know.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.651
- Why, have you killed somebody before?
- Uh-uh, I asked you first.

41:56.780 --> 41:58.515
Not that I know of.

42:00.651 --> 42:04.821
So, what was your non-serial
killer confession?

42:05.189 --> 42:06.856
Oh...

42:07.725 --> 42:08.791
I'm not really...

42:11.562 --> 42:13.496
I'm not really
a big fan of the ocean.

42:13.498 --> 42:16.533
What? What? How
can you not like the ocean?

42:16.535 --> 42:20.069
That's like saying you don't like music
or are not that big a fan of food.

42:20.071 --> 42:21.938
Let me clarify. I used to
like the ocean,

42:21.940 --> 42:24.707
and then I saw this <i>monster hunters</i>
episode where they go looking

42:24.709 --> 42:28.678
for the giant squid, and then ever since
then, haven't stepped foot in the water.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.347
The Kraken episode,
that is my favorite episode!

42:31.349 --> 42:33.716
- Yes. It is?
- Totally!

42:33.718 --> 42:35.351
Like when they find out
there's thousands of squid

42:35.353 --> 42:37.921
just hanging out a few hundred
feet below the ocean surface?

42:37.923 --> 42:39.822
- The squid superhighway!
- Superhighway!

42:39.824 --> 42:41.457
Scariest fucking thing
I've ever seen!

42:41.459 --> 42:43.459
Oh, come on, it's not
scary, it's fascinating.

42:43.461 --> 42:46.429
How they all came up to that one
squid, put the camera on him,

42:46.431 --> 42:49.899
and instead of attacking him they
were just curious and looking at him,

42:49.901 --> 42:51.367
it was like, it was so cute.

42:51.369 --> 42:54.470
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Teddy bears are cute.

42:54.472 --> 42:56.205
Penguins are cute.

42:56.207 --> 42:59.042
Super-intelligent squid?
Nightmare fucking material.

42:59.044 --> 43:02.245
Oh, come on.
It doesn't sound amazing?

43:02.247 --> 43:03.813
It's like that ll cool J movie.

43:03.815 --> 43:03.813
No!

43:03.815 --> 43:07.951
I mean, yes on the ll cool J movie,
except that was with sharks.

43:07.953 --> 43:09.986
But no on the giant squid.

43:09.988 --> 43:12.322
They are like
the assholes of the ocean.

43:12.324 --> 43:15.491
That's why all the deep-sea divers
had to wear those special wet suits

43:15.493 --> 43:18.227
it had so much chain-mail on it,
it was basically bulletproof.

43:18.229 --> 43:20.463
I know! How awesome is that?

43:21.532 --> 43:23.766
Okay, like...

43:23.768 --> 43:29.806
When you see something that is
beautiful and captivating and unknown,

43:29.808 --> 43:31.674
don't you just wanna jump in?

43:36.981 --> 43:38.081
No!

43:38.083 --> 43:42.251
Not at all. In fact, ever
since I saw that episode,

43:42.253 --> 43:45.188
I've been eating more
calamari, 'cause fuck squid.

43:45.190 --> 43:49.959
Well, that's just too bad,
'cause I'm part squid, you know?

43:49.961 --> 43:52.428
- Oh, you are?
- Uh-huh. On my mother's side.

43:52.430 --> 43:53.590
They're from northern Europe.

43:54.598 --> 43:57.767
You don't look squid-ish
at all.

43:57.769 --> 43:59.535
Well, check it out.

44:03.607 --> 44:04.707
It's a Gill.

44:05.976 --> 44:07.176
How'd you do that?

44:09.246 --> 44:10.813
Same way I did this.

44:13.117 --> 44:15.485
This is for my aunt Bernice.

44:25.496 --> 44:26.562
Fuck squid!

44:26.997 --> 44:28.431
Harry?

44:28.433 --> 44:30.867
Harry, are you okay?

44:30.869 --> 44:33.403
- What happened?
- I don't know, you just kept saying

44:33.405 --> 44:36.039
"fuck squid" over and over
again, and then you...

44:36.041 --> 44:38.474
Okay, you know what?
This party is lame,

44:38.476 --> 44:41.110
we're leaving. Are you
coming or are you staying?

44:42.279 --> 44:44.514
What the fuck
are you looking at?

44:44.516 --> 44:46.516
Are you having a stroke?

44:50.554 --> 44:51.754
Hello?

44:56.894 --> 44:59.629
What the fuck is wrong
with this guy?

44:59.631 --> 45:01.531
Okay, you know what?
We're leaving.

45:01.533 --> 45:04.534
Okay. Are you gonna be okay?
Bye, Harry.

45:07.938 --> 45:09.105
Fuck squid.

45:12.510 --> 45:15.978
So this guy, he's like, "hey,
man, that's not a wrench,"

45:15.980 --> 45:18.314
and I was like, "don't worry,
I'm not a mechanic!"

45:21.686 --> 45:24.406
Oh, man, that was... I didn't see
that one coming, man. That's great.

45:25.289 --> 45:28.091
Thanks, Kenny.
Thanks, Martha.

45:28.093 --> 45:30.560
I just want to say thanks
for inviting us over here,

45:30.562 --> 45:30.560
you guys are so cool.

45:30.562 --> 45:34.664
You thought you were going to a
meth lab in the woods, didn't you?

45:34.666 --> 45:36.432
- No, I didn't...
- That's what, that's what he thought.

45:36.434 --> 45:39.435
Okay, for, like, a second!
Just for a second!

45:39.437 --> 45:41.804
You don't know what you're
getting into!

45:41.806 --> 45:45.308
No, man, now see, that's the thing,
like, I know what it looks like,

45:45.310 --> 45:47.210
but we don't judge people here,
that's what's going on here.

45:47.212 --> 45:47.210
I love that.

45:47.212 --> 45:50.546
- Anybody can come, you do what you wanna do.
- Yes.

45:50.548 --> 45:52.148
- You do who you wanna do.
- Yes.

45:52.150 --> 45:54.417
I know it looks like
a lot of derelicts

45:54.419 --> 45:57.019
and ne'er do Wells around here,
shady characters, you know?

45:57.021 --> 46:01.257
But some of these people, some of
these people are Nobel prize winners,

46:01.259 --> 46:02.759
- you know?
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

46:02.761 --> 46:04.327
That guy won a Nobel prize?

46:04.329 --> 46:07.430
Him, oh, no, no.
That's Jerry. Jerry's...

46:07.432 --> 46:09.532
Jerry's got a crack problem.

46:09.534 --> 46:11.367
Here, baby. Have one of these.

46:11.369 --> 46:15.104
Martha, I can't have any more of these, I've
been fucking eating the shit out of them.

46:15.106 --> 46:17.607
- So I'm full. You know.
- You ate a bunch of these?

46:17.609 --> 46:19.642
Yeah, kind of for dinner.

46:21.246 --> 46:22.945
What?

46:22.947 --> 46:24.680
He ate them for dinner.

46:26.317 --> 46:28.151
You wanted to get on our level.

46:28.153 --> 46:30.353
You just did, man.

46:30.355 --> 46:32.655
With a bullet.

46:32.657 --> 46:35.158
I hope that tux has
a seatbelt, buddy.

46:35.160 --> 46:39.095
- These aren't mints?
- No, baby, these aren't just mints.

46:39.097 --> 46:41.831
We found out these orgies always
turned out a little more fun

46:41.833 --> 46:43.766
if everybody was tripping balls.

46:43.768 --> 46:45.368
So we...

46:45.370 --> 46:46.602
Ooh, speaking of balls.

46:46.604 --> 46:47.904
Did you say orgy?

46:47.906 --> 46:50.640
Here we go. What is it,
8:30 already?

46:52.109 --> 46:54.277
Um, bowie, guess what type
of Oreo I like best.

46:54.945 --> 46:56.212
Can you guess?

46:56.214 --> 46:58.614
Probably a double stuffed,
you're going to say?

46:58.616 --> 47:00.249
How did you...

47:00.251 --> 47:00.249
You heard that joke already.

47:00.251 --> 47:04.353
I love that almost as much as I love getting
banged by two boys at the same time.

47:04.355 --> 47:07.190
All right. Dealer's choice. Lightning
round. Let's go. Who wants what?

47:07.192 --> 47:08.925
Yeah, look,
I gotta coach, so get...

47:09.393 --> 47:11.093
Jesus Christ.

47:11.095 --> 47:14.363
Look at the ass on this one.
Who's your dad, Michelangelo?

47:14.365 --> 47:16.666
It's like two cantaloupes trying
to kiss each other back there.

47:16.668 --> 47:19.368
Look at that. Let them even
move when you did that.

47:19.370 --> 47:20.736
That's good.

47:20.738 --> 47:24.173
That's a strong ass.
Just relax, man. Just relax.

47:24.175 --> 47:27.810
Sweetie, do you want to get fucked? Because,
no, no, you're a guest in our home.

47:27.812 --> 47:30.112
You gotta loosen up.
You fucked me, Kenny.

47:30.114 --> 47:32.949
No, I mean somebody might
fuck you, but it wasn't me.

47:42.926 --> 47:44.594
<i>Gotta find Harry.</i>

47:50.767 --> 47:52.602
Gotta find Harry.

47:55.339 --> 47:56.973
<i>Gotta find Harry.</i>

48:01.011 --> 48:02.078
Gotta find Harry.

48:04.548 --> 48:05.748
Gotta find Harry.

48:05.865 --> 48:06.884
Gotta find Harry.

48:06.885 --> 48:12.455
<i>Fuck Harry. Let's go bury
ourselves in some man ass.</i>

48:12.457 --> 48:13.756
Who said that?

48:13.758 --> 48:15.491
<i>Down here!</i>

48:16.593 --> 48:18.327
<i>What's up, motherfucker?</i>

48:19.296 --> 48:21.998
No. This is crazy.
This is bad.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.634
<i>Oh, I know. This orgy
started 20 minutes ago,</i>

48:24.636 --> 48:28.204
<i>and I haven't played reverse Jenga with
any of these fine pieces of man meat.</i>

48:28.206 --> 48:30.072
<i>It's a tragedy!</i>

48:30.074 --> 48:32.475
How is that a tragedy? We're not
gay, that sounds crazy to me.

48:32.477 --> 48:34.577
<i>Speak for yourself, breeder.</i>

48:34.579 --> 48:35.811
What do you mean, I bang chicks!

48:35.813 --> 48:38.114
<i>Ugh, don't remind me.
I was there.</i>

48:38.116 --> 48:40.182
Yeah, so how are you gay? I don't
fucking get what you're saying.

48:40.184 --> 48:41.417
Don't talk so loud.

48:41.419 --> 48:43.052
<i>Bitch, you're not
the boss of me.</i>

48:43.054 --> 48:43.052
<i>You don't know everything
that I do.</i>

48:43.054 --> 48:47.690
Yeah, I thought I did. This is a real
betrayal I didn't see coming at all.

48:50.994 --> 48:52.328
Harry.

48:52.330 --> 48:53.529
- Harry.
- Hmm?

48:53.531 --> 48:56.065
Harry, I'm freaking out, man.

48:57.367 --> 48:58.434
Don't be rude.

49:00.304 --> 49:01.370
Say hi to Jessica.

49:04.541 --> 49:05.608
Hello.

49:07.244 --> 49:08.724
How are you doing that
with your eyes?

49:11.748 --> 49:12.815
I don't know.

49:46.950 --> 49:50.519
Ten, 20, 30. Suppose we have ten fingers.
What if we had nine fingers?

49:50.521 --> 49:53.289
Then what would it be?
Nine, eight, 27, 36.

49:58.061 --> 50:00.596
<i>Look at my times tables. I'm a
fucking times table wizard.</i>

50:00.598 --> 50:02.498
I remember in first grade
I couldn't do my times tables,

50:02.500 --> 50:06.168
I cried so hard, the teacher just passed me
because she didn't want to deal with it.

50:16.346 --> 50:18.026
Dude, my thoughts
are in Spanish right now.

50:19.850 --> 50:21.530
That's fucked,
'cause I don't know Spanish.

50:26.923 --> 50:27.990
Bowie.

50:28.525 --> 50:30.459
What?

50:30.461 --> 50:32.595
Christine never liked
regular red M&M's.

50:33.597 --> 50:35.164
She thought they were boring.

50:35.166 --> 50:36.232
That's weird.

50:37.134 --> 50:38.834
She'd never eat a red M&M.

50:39.770 --> 50:41.604
Never eat a red M&M.

50:41.938 --> 50:43.672
Red M&M.

50:43.674 --> 50:45.441
Maybe I'm just a regular
red M&M.

50:47.278 --> 50:49.478
You are a regular red M&M.

50:49.480 --> 50:51.714
There's so many other types
of M&M's.

50:51.716 --> 50:54.617
I don't like when the M&M's
take their shells off...

50:54.619 --> 50:56.986
And they pretend like
it's their clothes.

50:56.988 --> 50:59.321
'Cause that's not their clothes.
That's their skin.

50:59.856 --> 51:01.557
Dark chocolate M&M's.

51:01.559 --> 51:02.625
<i>Dark chocolate.</i>

51:03.026 --> 51:04.493
Pretzel M&M's.

51:04.495 --> 51:06.395
<i>- Pretzel.</i>
- Mini M&M's.

51:06.397 --> 51:09.498
<i>Mini.</i>
Pumpkin spice M&M's!

51:09.500 --> 51:10.933
Harry?
Uhhuh?

51:10.935 --> 51:12.268
You need to bust out
of your shell.

51:12.270 --> 51:14.270
Oh.

51:14.272 --> 51:16.312
That's a good metaphor
for what we're talking about.

51:21.511 --> 51:23.712
I'm just an M&M!

51:26.751 --> 51:28.951
I'm just an M&M.

51:28.953 --> 51:31.120
I don't wanna be an M&M anymore.

51:37.327 --> 51:38.961
I think my dick's gay, man.

51:39.529 --> 51:40.596
Huh?

51:51.908 --> 51:52.975
Good morning.

51:56.012 --> 51:57.346
What happened?

51:57.348 --> 51:58.414
I don't know.

52:03.587 --> 52:04.653
Wait...

52:05.388 --> 52:06.956
Is this <i> crocodile Dundee ii?</i>

52:06.958 --> 52:08.424
Yeah.

52:08.426 --> 52:10.659
You got up just in time, man,
this is my favorite part.

52:10.661 --> 52:12.161
Oh, yeah.

52:12.163 --> 52:14.363
This is where he switches
clothes with the bad guy

52:14.365 --> 52:17.233
so that the other bad guys shoot
their boss instead of him.

52:17.235 --> 52:18.300
- Yeah.
- It's genius.

52:18.568 --> 52:19.635
So good.

52:21.738 --> 52:23.618
You know what would make
this movie even better?

52:23.707 --> 52:24.940
Danny Trejo?

52:24.942 --> 52:26.408
Fucking right!

52:26.410 --> 52:28.544
- Danny Trejo makes everything better.
- Yeah, he does.

52:28.546 --> 52:31.881
Imagine <i> crocodile Dundee ii</i>
starring Danny Trejo...

52:31.883 --> 52:31.881
Movie would be 10 minutes long.

52:31.883 --> 52:35.951
They would just steal his girlfriend,
and then they'd call him and be like,

52:35.953 --> 52:38.153
"hey, we have your girlfriend,"
and he'd just be like...

52:39.790 --> 52:42.057
And then they would just send
her back with an apology letter

52:42.059 --> 52:43.893
and a box of chocolates.

52:43.895 --> 52:45.995
What about <i> jaws</i>
starring Danny Trejo?

52:45.997 --> 52:48.364
- Okay, is Danny Trejo jaws?
- No.

52:48.366 --> 52:51.901
Danny Trejo swims out into the
middle of the ocean to find jaws,

52:51.903 --> 52:54.637
uppercuts jaws,
sends jaws in orbit,

52:54.639 --> 52:58.374
and then Danny Trejo just stares into
the camera for an hour and a half.

52:58.376 --> 53:00.809
Ooh.<i> Independence day</i>
starring Danny Trejo.

53:00.811 --> 53:03.145
Danny Trejo rides his
motorcycle into space,

53:03.147 --> 53:03.145
straight onto the
alien spaceship

53:03.147 --> 53:08.150
and just looks at them all and goes,
"don't even fucking think about it."

53:08.152 --> 53:10.352
And then aliens are like,
"sorry," and they leave,

53:10.354 --> 53:12.254
and then Danny Trejo just
goes to will Smith like,

53:12.256 --> 53:14.723
"quit fucking around
and start rapping."

53:14.725 --> 53:16.959
<i>Castaway</i> starring Danny Trejo.

53:16.961 --> 53:19.428
Where it's just Trejo?
I like a just Trejo film.

53:19.430 --> 53:22.264
Except for the volleyball,
which is also Danny Trejo.

53:22.266 --> 53:24.533
<i>Indiana Trejo,</i> where, the...

53:24.535 --> 53:28.103
That he opens up the ark of the covenant
and then the ark of the covenant melts.

53:28.105 --> 53:30.439
- Mmm.
- 'Cause it saw Danny Trejo.

53:30.441 --> 53:33.242
What if, instead of <i> fight
club,</i> it's Danny Trejo club.

53:33.244 --> 53:35.911
Danny Trejo is...
Mrs. Doubtfire.

53:35.913 --> 53:37.746
- Ooh.
- "Toodeloo.

53:38.315 --> 53:39.782
"I miss my kids."

53:39.784 --> 53:42.184
- What about <i> Sophie's choice</i> starring Danny Trejo.
- Ooh.

53:42.186 --> 53:45.321
So Danny Trejo has to decide
between two other Danny Trejos.

53:45.323 --> 53:47.790
- So that's a triple Trejo.
- Talking about a triple Trejo.

53:47.792 --> 53:51.393
Ooh.<i> The lion king,</i>
after Mufasa held up Simba,

53:51.395 --> 53:54.863
the camera turns around, and it's not
Simba, it's goddamn Danny Trejo.

53:54.865 --> 53:56.332
- Mmm.
- And then Mufasa's like,

53:56.334 --> 53:57.967
"everything the light touches,

53:57.969 --> 54:00.803
"except for the elephant graveyard," and
Danny Trejo's like, "fuck you, dude,"

54:00.805 --> 54:02.838
and he goes straight to the
elephant graveyard, and guess what?

54:02.840 --> 54:03.973
That's his now, too.

54:14.017 --> 54:15.184
Oh, yes.

54:15.819 --> 54:16.885
Thank you.

54:18.688 --> 54:20.522
- Got the bags!
- Yes!

54:20.524 --> 54:21.824
Can't wait to get out
of these tuxedos.

54:21.826 --> 54:23.592
Yeah, I've been needing
this guy.

54:24.561 --> 54:25.728
All right.

54:27.097 --> 54:28.163
Yes.

54:28.898 --> 54:30.699
This is your go bag?

54:30.701 --> 54:31.767
Booze and candy?

54:31.769 --> 54:33.602
What would be in your go bag?

54:33.604 --> 54:35.904
I dunno, maybe a toothbrush,
some socks...

54:35.906 --> 54:38.741
No, man, I wanna have some
fun if I need to leave town.

54:38.743 --> 54:40.023
Dig around. You're gonna
love it.

54:40.910 --> 54:42.144
Nice. Baseball cards.

54:42.146 --> 54:44.213
Yeah, I've been thinking,
and in the future,

54:44.215 --> 54:46.015
money will end up being
valueless,

54:46.017 --> 54:48.250
but you know what people will
always Cherish and want?

54:48.252 --> 54:49.485
Ken Griffey Jr.

54:51.087 --> 54:53.355
- Whoa!
- Fuck man, what the shit?

54:53.357 --> 54:54.890
That is not my bag.

54:54.892 --> 54:54.890
Yeah, I know.

54:54.892 --> 54:58.694
I think I'd figure it out if my best
friend was fucking Pablo Escobar.

54:58.696 --> 55:00.929
What are you doing? How did
this fucking get here?

55:00.931 --> 55:02.698
Hello?

55:02.700 --> 55:04.500
- Hi. The door was open.
- Hey, Colette.

55:05.168 --> 55:07.036
- Hi.
- Do you want some, uh...

55:07.038 --> 55:09.038
- Some salt water Taffy?
- No, we don't have a lot of it.

55:09.040 --> 55:11.273
No thanks, I'm good.

55:11.275 --> 55:14.376
I just came by because Angela wants
to hire you for us for the day.

55:15.478 --> 55:16.545
Okay, for what?

55:17.480 --> 55:19.048
Massages.

55:19.050 --> 55:22.951
- Oh, yes. Because that's...
- That's what we do. That's what we do.

55:22.953 --> 55:24.019
That's who we are.

55:24.854 --> 55:24.853
Great.

55:24.855 --> 55:28.791
So we'll come... You should go,
you go get ready on the yacht.

55:28.793 --> 55:30.726
Yeah, we'll freshen up, and...

55:30.728 --> 55:32.288
- We'll meet you there.
- Just go ahead.

55:33.196 --> 55:34.596
Okay, yeah. I'll see
you there.

55:35.031 --> 55:36.098
Okay.

55:37.567 --> 55:37.566
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

55:37.568 --> 55:41.837
You figure out what to do with this, um,
I'm gonna go get us some clothes, okay?

55:47.544 --> 55:49.712
You couldn't
find anything better?

55:49.714 --> 55:51.213
I wouldn't be caught dead
in this.

55:51.215 --> 55:53.849
This is by far the coolest stuff
they had at the gift shop.

55:53.851 --> 55:55.818
We look like extras
on <i> Magnum, P.I.</i>

55:55.820 --> 55:57.686
Okay, how is that a bad thing?

55:58.288 --> 55:59.355
Tom Selleck?

56:00.890 --> 56:01.957
Goddamn it, you're right.

56:02.392 --> 56:03.459
He is timeless.

56:04.361 --> 56:05.694
Ladies!

56:05.696 --> 56:08.897
Last night was crazy. Who's
ready to feel some magic...

56:08.899 --> 56:11.100
What are you guys? What are you...
okay. Ouch.

56:11.102 --> 56:13.302
Hey, this guy's
pinching my neck right now!

56:13.304 --> 56:14.636
He's got a monkey grip.

56:17.741 --> 56:19.241
Who the fuck are you?

56:19.243 --> 56:20.603
I don't know.
Who the fuck are you?

56:21.811 --> 56:23.078
What?

56:27.016 --> 56:28.450
Honey...

56:31.421 --> 56:32.588
Do you know these guys?

56:33.390 --> 56:35.290
Um...

56:35.292 --> 56:37.292
No, I never seen them
before in my life.

56:38.828 --> 56:41.997
Well what's he talking
about magic fingers, then?

56:42.632 --> 56:42.631
Um...

56:42.633 --> 56:48.237
Oh, you know what? I was dancing with
the girls the other night at the club,

56:48.239 --> 56:50.305
and I hurt my back,

56:50.307 --> 56:53.475
so I called the hotel and I said, "do
you have any massage therapists?"

56:53.477 --> 56:55.911
This must be them, you guys are
the massage therapists, right?

56:55.913 --> 56:58.547
- Yep, that's us.
- Okay, cool, yeah, so they're from the hotel.

56:58.549 --> 57:01.049
- Oh, that makes sense. Yeah.
- Mmm. Yeah.

57:01.051 --> 57:04.119
I mean, what two idiots are going to
voluntarily wear clothes like that?

57:05.522 --> 57:07.656
So, the hotel makes you wear
this shit?

57:07.658 --> 57:10.159
Uh, yes, sir.
Feels like fiberglass.

57:10.161 --> 57:11.593
- Pretty itchy.
- Oh, I bet it is.

57:11.595 --> 57:11.593
May I see?

57:11.595 --> 57:15.230
I actually think it makes me look
quite strapping. Kinda buff, even.

57:16.466 --> 57:18.066
Also a magnet for Bo.

57:18.735 --> 57:18.734
I guess.

57:18.736 --> 57:22.171
Okay, honey, why don't you
go downstairs and get ready.

57:22.173 --> 57:24.006
I'll send your friends
down in a sec.

57:24.008 --> 57:25.941
Thank you, honey, I love you.

57:25.943 --> 57:27.576
Anything for you, sugar lips.

57:30.547 --> 57:32.258
You guys have a really
beautiful relationship.

57:32.282 --> 57:34.016
Thank you.

57:34.018 --> 57:37.953
So... Your massage therapy
story might check out,

57:39.122 --> 57:41.089
but that still doesn't mean
you're not gonna try

57:41.091 --> 57:44.026
to get your slimy little
pencil dicks into my wife.

57:44.028 --> 57:45.394
- Slimy...
- Mine's actually average,

57:45.396 --> 57:47.029
I've done research, and I have
nothing to be ashamed of.

57:47.031 --> 57:49.832
Sir, I can assure you
that on behalf of the...

57:49.834 --> 57:52.034
Tradewinds Island Resort,

57:52.036 --> 57:54.436
we have no ill-intentions
towards your wife whatsoever.

57:55.872 --> 57:56.939
Why would I believe that?

57:58.608 --> 58:01.243
- Because...
- Because we're gay.

58:01.245 --> 58:02.978
- Because we're gay.
- Yep.

58:02.980 --> 58:04.546
Yeah.

58:05.181 --> 58:06.648
- Gay?
- Super.

58:06.650 --> 58:08.450
Super gay. We do all
the stereotypes.

58:08.452 --> 58:09.818
Uh... I won best dressed
in high school...

58:09.820 --> 58:12.087
Yep, yep,
we watch a lot of bravo.

58:12.089 --> 58:14.456
- Really?
- We make, like, passionate love to lady gaga, like,

58:14.458 --> 58:17.559
- passionate love, it's like two suns burning.
- That's a lot of detail.

58:17.561 --> 58:19.061
You two knuckleheads,

58:19.929 --> 58:21.430
you walk on to my yacht,

58:22.065 --> 58:24.299
wanna touch my wife,

58:24.301 --> 58:26.602
tell me you're gay and you
expect me to believe it?

58:29.405 --> 58:30.472
Yes?

58:32.876 --> 58:35.377
Okay, then. Do you need help
finding your way downstairs?

58:37.313 --> 58:39.848
Wait, for real?
You believe it? We're good?

58:39.850 --> 58:41.149
Yeah, sure. I believe you.

58:41.151 --> 58:43.685
I mean, what, I'm gonna make
you touch dicks or something?

58:43.687 --> 58:46.855
This is the 21st century
for Christ's sakes,

58:46.857 --> 58:51.026
couple of Pinnocchios tell me they're
gay, which you two obviously are,

58:51.028 --> 58:52.694
I'm not gonna make you
have to prove it.

58:52.696 --> 58:56.498
It's like telling me you're
left-handed or red-headed.

58:56.500 --> 58:58.033
I mean, I dunno if it's
obvious that we're gay.

58:58.035 --> 58:59.835
Not quite sure what
Pinocchio has to do with this.

58:59.837 --> 59:01.670
I feel like we give off
a masculine vibe.

59:01.672 --> 59:03.639
Not at all.
See my guys here?

59:04.908 --> 59:06.241
They're gay!

59:06.243 --> 59:07.443
I officiated at their wedding.

59:08.044 --> 59:09.511
Very beautiful.

59:09.513 --> 59:10.712
Your mother cried...

59:11.681 --> 59:12.881
- Very sweet.
- That's wonderful.

59:12.883 --> 59:15.617
Now go.
Don't keep my wife waiting.

59:15.619 --> 59:16.985
You guys need help
finding your way downstairs?

59:16.987 --> 59:18.520
Nope, we'll find it.

59:18.522 --> 59:20.489
If you guys excuse me, I've got
some business to attend to.

59:20.491 --> 59:21.557
No problem.

59:24.727 --> 59:26.395
Just go below.

59:26.397 --> 59:28.130
But way below, 'cause it's
a big boat.

59:35.071 --> 59:36.605
I'm nervous.

59:36.607 --> 59:38.183
I'm not. I do this stuff
at work all the time.

59:38.207 --> 59:39.274
What?

59:40.109 --> 59:41.176
Hello?

59:44.213 --> 59:45.681
- Hello.
- Hi.

59:46.282 --> 59:47.382
You ready?

59:47.384 --> 59:48.850
Yeah, so, uh, where
do you want me?

59:48.852 --> 59:50.152
Uh, the bed.

59:50.154 --> 59:51.587
I mean... this table.

59:51.589 --> 59:52.688
Table bed.

59:54.257 --> 59:55.958
- Yeah.
- I'll turn around.

59:55.960 --> 59:57.025
Thank you.

59:57.694 --> 59:58.760
Okay.

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:05.100
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:06.535
Before we get started,
you should know that

01:00:06.537 --> 01:00:09.638
a lot of my clients refer to
me as the David Blaine of

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.706
magic.

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:12.507
That doesn't make sense.

01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:13.942
David Blaine... never mind.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:13.942
Teachable moment.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:20.349
Did you know that it's well documented in
scientific and anthropological communities

01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:20.349
that while

01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:26.588
comparable and complementary skills and
attributes are absolutely essential

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:28.857
in achieving intimacy
between two people,

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:31.059
the same is not so much

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:32.894
true when it comes
to things like

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:34.296
sexual fulfillment or

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:35.731
sheer, unbridled

01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:37.633
Animalistic Passion.

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:40.068
- What the fuck is happening?
- Eye contact.

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:43.672
Studies have shown that when it comes to
pure adulterated no strings attached sex

01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:47.009
that's when the highest levels of Dopamine
and Oxytocin are released from the body.

01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:48.143
And subsequently,

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:50.746
the most intense and
pleasurable orgasms occur

01:00:50.748 --> 01:00:54.716
when one partner has disproportionately
more of something than the other.

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:58.286
In our case, it's like, "oh, my god,
take your pick," I mean maturity.

01:00:58.288 --> 01:01:00.088
- No.
- Basic self-awareness.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.990
I am very aware that I am great.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.558
Ability to see at night.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.993
Who has that?
Which one of us is a lemur?

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:06.728
I mean the list
goes on and on. You get it,

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.463
blah, blah, blah.
You're terrible!

01:01:11.634 --> 01:01:12.934
Intercourse...

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:14.002
Commence!

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:16.038
Okay!

01:01:31.754 --> 01:01:33.155
Whoa.

01:01:33.157 --> 01:01:34.322
Are you okay?

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.124
Yep. Yeah.

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:38.060
Just, uh...

01:01:38.062 --> 01:01:39.127
Fluffing your aura.

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:41.229
Oh.

01:01:41.231 --> 01:01:42.664
Yeah.

01:01:42.666 --> 01:01:43.932
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:51.640
So, um...

01:01:51.642 --> 01:01:54.409
Do you that think maybe
you can get my upper bicuspid?

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:57.245
Your upper bicuspid?

01:01:58.114 --> 01:02:00.082
- Sure.
- Hmm.

01:02:00.084 --> 01:02:02.617
Of course, mine always
gets tight as well.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.987
Okay, okay...

01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:07.055
What are you doing?

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:08.123
What are you talking about?

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:09.524
This is my bicuspid!

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:12.094
Why do you want me
to massage your tooth?

01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:13.762
Oh, my god, I don't want you
to massage my tooth.

01:02:13.764 --> 01:02:15.530
- Now who the fuck are you?
- Okay!

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:16.598
Okay.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.568
- I'm not a massage therapist.
- No shit.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:20.769
Or a dentist.

01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:22.404
Oh, and by the way I looked up
the Handies.

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:23.605
You don't even want to know
what came up.

01:02:23.607 --> 01:02:24.673
All right, the truth...

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:26.942
I'm here on my honeymoon.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.511
With bowie?

01:02:29.513 --> 01:02:30.946
Yeah.

01:02:30.948 --> 01:02:32.214
Oh.

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:33.548
No, not like that.

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:37.252
I was supposed to get married
this past weekend.

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.754
Obviously, it didn't happen.

01:02:38.756 --> 01:02:39.988
And so now,

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.190
bowie and I decided to go on
the honeymoon together.

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:43.825
It's just been a complete
what-the-fuck fest ever since.

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:43.825
I don't know what's going on.

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:47.395
Okay, the only thing I do know is
that the only time I'm not completely

01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:49.364
miserable is when I'm with you.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.367
Wow.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:53.435
Yeah.

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:55.270
That really sucks.

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:58.106
Oh.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.574
No, I mean that part about

01:02:59.576 --> 01:03:00.776
your wedding sucks.

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.912
The other part was really sweet.

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:08.189
You're the best thing that's
happened to me since Friday.

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:16.892
You know, I've seen a lot of

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:18.994
movies that start out this way.

01:03:18.996 --> 01:03:21.696
I've been in a lot of movies
that started out this way.

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:24.666
Oh.

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:26.768
No, really.

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:31.406
So if at any point I start taking
off these sexy little shorts...

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:35.043
Just stop me, it's a bad habit.

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:38.547
Uh, okay, noted.

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:42.050
I'll...

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:43.285
Do some rocks.

01:03:43.287 --> 01:03:44.352
My specialty.

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:54.429
That's...

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:57.199
Oh, ow!

01:03:57.201 --> 01:03:58.961
Okay, that one was hot.
It was on the bottom.

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:00.769
It's okay.

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:03.305
Yes!

01:04:07.911 --> 01:04:09.511
Oh, my god, damn it!

01:04:11.715 --> 01:04:13.915
I'm out of rocks, um...

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:15.150
I'm gonna go find some more.

01:04:15.152 --> 01:04:16.218
You stay right here.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.421
You're a sweet,
sweet angel from heaven.

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:21.690
Hmm.

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:25.694
So...

01:04:25.696 --> 01:04:26.761
How did it end?

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.130
Spectacularly.

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:32.934
So what do you really do?

01:04:35.138 --> 01:04:36.238
I'm a lawyer.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.939
- Shut up, you're a lawyer?
- Yeah.

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:40.308
And you've lied about being
a massage therapist?

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:41.443
I plead the fifth.

01:04:42.913 --> 01:04:43.979
Well done.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:45.980
What about you?
What do you do?

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:48.116
Oh, um...

01:04:48.118 --> 01:04:51.186
I am a professional
waster of potential.

01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:54.289
Okay, what does that mean?

01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:56.024
You know when you're a kid

01:04:56.026 --> 01:04:58.326
and all you dream about is all
the wonderful and amazing

01:04:58.328 --> 01:04:59.888
things you're gonna do
when you grow up?

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:01.563
Sure.

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.605
Well, I grew up and I never
did any of those things.

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:06.635
Oh, come on.

01:05:06.637 --> 01:05:08.870
When I was a kid, I dreamed
about being a firetruck.

01:05:08.872 --> 01:05:11.306
Like literally a firetruck.

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:12.540
That's what I wanted to be.

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:14.576
Stop.

01:05:14.578 --> 01:05:17.045
I mean, you had to have done
some cool things with your life.

01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:20.215
Yeah, I've done some things.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.119
Okay...

01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:26.521
It's killing me. I know that I know you.
How do I know you?

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:28.123
Um...

01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:29.190
Hmm...

01:05:29.192 --> 01:05:31.159
Ah... okay. When I was 21,

01:05:31.161 --> 01:05:34.462
I was picked to be the face
of a new energy sports drink.

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:38.967
Diesel valve.

01:05:38.969 --> 01:05:40.769
- Yeah.
- Oh, my god.

01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:42.570
You're the diesel Valkyrie.

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:45.407
Holy shit.

01:05:45.409 --> 01:05:48.576
That super bowl commercial was huge.
You were everywhere.

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:52.380
Yeah, I was. I mean one minute I was
just some college kid and the next...

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:53.481
Boom.

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:55.216
It's crazy.

01:05:55.218 --> 01:05:57.519
You think your life is gonna
go this one way

01:05:57.521 --> 01:06:00.155
and then something happens
that completely changes it.

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.157
Yeah.

01:06:02.159 --> 01:06:03.224
So then what do you do?

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:07.195
It's your life.

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:08.296
You live it.

01:06:10.032 --> 01:06:11.199
So no regrets, huh?

01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:13.702
Well, I was just

01:06:13.704 --> 01:06:17.839
two credits shy of getting my degree in
marine biology when everything happened.

01:06:17.841 --> 01:06:20.909
Okay, I get it. That's why
you're scuba diving every day.

01:06:20.911 --> 01:06:23.478
Yeah, yeah, I've actually been
doing it with some of the people

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.913
from the marine
institute here and...

01:06:24.915 --> 01:06:27.349
They said if I wanted to stay
to work on a fellowship

01:06:27.351 --> 01:06:29.150
and finish my degree, I could.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:30.785
That's awesome.

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:33.188
Is it?

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.188
I don't know.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:36.558
I mean, I wouldn't do it 'cause I'm
scared shitless of the ocean...

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.026
But it's cool for you.

01:06:38.028 --> 01:06:38.026
It's scary

01:06:38.028 --> 01:06:42.130
actually, possibly becoming the
person you've always wanted to be.

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:46.234
I'm not big on plans.

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:48.470
Well I think if you
have a chance,

01:06:48.472 --> 01:06:49.537
you should go for it.

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:54.442
Okay.

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:57.746
Okay what?

01:06:58.748 --> 01:06:59.814
Okay, I'll do it.

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.052
- Yeah.
- That's it?

01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:07.422
You're just gonna make a huge
life-altering decision just like that?

01:07:07.424 --> 01:07:09.357
How else do you make one?

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:14.062
You just changed my entire life.

01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:15.697
Hold on. Slow down.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:18.733
I think maybe you should think about it.
I can't handle that responsibility.

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:20.602
It's stressing me out.

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:27.308
Today was a good day.

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:28.977
You didn't even have
to use your AK.

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:39.187
Hmm. That feels so good.

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:42.323
Yeah.

01:07:42.325 --> 01:07:44.592
Yeah, you're so good
with your hands.

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:46.895
Thanks, it's called
the curious cat.

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:48.430
Hmm.

01:07:48.432 --> 01:07:50.799
You want the ocean breeze
package now?

01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:52.267
Ooh, yes, please!

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:53.568
- Coming right up.
- Hmm.

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:00.408
Just like you're at
the ocean, right?

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:02.944
Maybe if the ocean ate a giant
fucking bowl of nachos.

01:08:02.946 --> 01:08:04.546
Jesus Christ, what'd you eat?

01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:07.148
A giant bowl of nachos.

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:09.017
We'll stay down here.

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:12.454
Hey, come on in.

01:08:12.456 --> 01:08:15.190
- Doing this.
- Yeah, doing this.

01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:16.925
- Just, uh...
- Ah!

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:16.925
Whoa.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:20.161
- You all right?
- Sorry, I didn't know you were starting.

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:21.529
Seem a little tense?

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:22.831
A little tense.

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:24.432
Yeah, uh, I haven't

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:26.634
been back here
since my husband passed away

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:28.536
tragically.

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:31.305
You're husband passed away
in Rancho para?

01:08:31.308 --> 01:08:34.242
Um, yeah, he was

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.944
Vincent's accountant
for many years,

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:38.011
and then he died in a very
tragic accident.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:39.948
What happened?

01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:41.649
Well, he

01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:44.085
accidentally shot himself
in the face

01:08:44.087 --> 01:08:46.254
and then he fell into
a car trunk

01:08:46.256 --> 01:08:48.723
and it landed in the bottom
of the ocean, so...

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:50.425
It was a lot.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:52.127
It was like Murphy's law.

01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:53.394
Like, what else could go wrong?

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:54.996
Yeah...

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.930
I trust the trip was enjoyable?

01:08:56.933 --> 01:08:58.832
Can we get you anything?

01:08:58.835 --> 01:09:00.502
Hors D'oeuvres,
drinks, something?

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:05.273
If it's all the same to you,

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:07.207
let us dispense with the

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:09.010
- pleasantries.
- Right.

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:10.944
Straight to business.
No bullshit.

01:09:10.947 --> 01:09:12.147
A man after my own heart.

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:15.984
I love cash.

01:09:15.986 --> 01:09:18.353
It's always the right size
and the right color.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:19.821
You're just so talented.

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:21.156
Do you ever turn it off?

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:24.058
I don't know how.

01:09:26.763 --> 01:09:29.296
Careful, my husband's upstairs.

01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:30.499
Yeah, what's up with that guy?

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:32.901
Well, you know...

01:09:32.903 --> 01:09:34.569
It's funny you should ask.

01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:37.505
He and I have sort of

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.805
an agreement.

01:09:38.808 --> 01:09:40.408
Like?

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.977
You both agree <i>Shawshank
redemption</i> is a great move?

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:44.045
Uh-uh.

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:48.316
That is a different agreement!
Yeah, no, I like...

01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:50.752
I like this agreement more.

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:52.353
Wow...

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.355
It's actually, like,
totally average.

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:55.490
Thank you.

01:09:55.492 --> 01:09:57.058
What does Vincent do exactly?

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.160
Oh, he's a man of many pursuits.

01:09:59.162 --> 01:10:00.228
Um...

01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:02.830
He has an import-export
business of some sort.

01:10:02.832 --> 01:10:04.766
He owns many
abandoned warehouses.

01:10:04.768 --> 01:10:06.167
He has a limo company.

01:10:06.169 --> 01:10:09.237
Strip club. The limo takes
people to the strip club.

01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:11.806
He has an exotic animal farm
with a lot of lizards.

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:14.876
He also has very hungry pigs.

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:16.811
You're going to like
our product.

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:18.513
It's, uh, Primo shit.

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:25.887
Okay, well, why don't
you lay down, I just gotta

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:27.355
take care of some things.

01:10:27.357 --> 01:10:28.790
That sounds like Vincent.

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:32.360
- That's a good impression.
- Just give me one minute...

01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:35.330
- Sure.
- And I'll be right back.

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:38.833
Bowie?

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:40.134
Bowie?

01:10:40.136 --> 01:10:41.703
Okay, remember that agreement.

01:10:41.705 --> 01:10:43.371
- Okay.
- Keep that up here.

01:10:43.373 --> 01:10:44.493
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

01:10:50.513 --> 01:10:52.747
Bowie, come out here.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:55.350
Can I talk to you for one minute please?
Thank you.

01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:57.552
What are you doing?
I'm getting to know Angela

01:10:57.554 --> 01:10:59.454
and I'm this close to a fucking
two for Tuesday right now.

01:10:59.456 --> 01:11:01.656
That's a bad idea. Do you
know who her husband is?

01:11:01.658 --> 01:11:04.459
Yeah, he's the nicest man I've ever heard
of. They have a beautiful agreement.

01:11:04.461 --> 01:11:05.994
Yeah, I'm sure they do.

01:11:05.996 --> 01:11:08.496
I bet he made her an offer
she couldn't refuse.

01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:09.897
What are you talking about?

01:11:09.899 --> 01:11:11.766
When she said this
is her family's yacht,

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:13.668
she didn't mean her family.

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:15.603
She meant the family!

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:17.639
Like the Kardashians?

01:11:17.641 --> 01:11:19.807
No! The fucking mafia!

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:21.776
We need to get the hell
out of here.

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:23.678
Okay, we just need
seven minutes.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:24.846
Now!

01:11:24.848 --> 01:11:26.948
I can do it in two and a half.

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:38.993
Excuse me?

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:41.296
No, no, no, hold on.

01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:43.464
Let me pull up
my translation app.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:44.832
It's some kind of mistake...

01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:46.801
- Can you say that again?
- How dare you disrespect me!

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:48.083
We'll get this straightened out.

01:11:53.443 --> 01:11:54.842
<i>Bang, bang, bang.</i>

01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:56.004
Nope, you're right, let's go.

01:11:58.047 --> 01:11:59.781
Holy shit!

01:12:03.285 --> 01:12:04.952
This shouldn't
have been that easy.

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:08.856
I mean these are Japanese
triads for Christ's sake.

01:12:10.392 --> 01:12:11.626
I mean these guys

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:14.529
are lethal killing machines.
You ever watched the movies?

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:16.831
They, they use knives
and swords and shit.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:20.802
I mean one guy can take out
an entire squad.

01:12:20.804 --> 01:12:22.570
But here, it was like...

01:12:22.572 --> 01:12:25.406
Bang, bang, bang, they're dead.

01:12:25.408 --> 01:12:28.409
I mean, Craig, you didn't
even put down your tray.

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:30.478
I'm proud of you.

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.646
Hey, moron!

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:33.214
Get up here.

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:34.782
Yeah, boss man.

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:37.151
What the fuck is this?

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:38.953
Uh...

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:41.089
It's a suitcase full of clothes.

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:44.659
And, um...

01:12:44.661 --> 01:12:46.060
A bunch of dead

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:47.462
Koreans or...

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:48.830
Hawaiians maybe?

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:50.631
Ooh, mini hot-dogs!

01:12:51.133 --> 01:12:52.800
Okay. Hmm...

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:55.136
- You had one job.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:12:55.138 --> 01:12:56.871
One fucking job!

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:58.539
To go to the airport,

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:00.775
pick up a suitcase for me,

01:13:00.777 --> 01:13:01.943
and bring it back here.

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:04.579
This is not my suitcase.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.515
Where is my fucking suitcase?

01:13:07.517 --> 01:13:08.983
Oh, right.

01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:11.819
Funny story, I gave a lift
to these guys as a favor

01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:14.522
of a buddy of mine who
scored me really great weed

01:13:14.524 --> 01:13:16.958
and concert tickets,
if you guys need some.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:16.958
Anyways, uh...

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:21.963
I went and had to get their luggage as
well, I might have switched their bag

01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:23.030
with your bag.

01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:24.098
Honest mistake.

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:24.098
You know, my fault, but

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:28.069
they're staying here on the island
so it should be easy just to get

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:29.704
the bag back.
No harm, no foul.

01:13:36.044 --> 01:13:39.580
Randy, if you weren't my mother's favorite
nephew, I swear to Christ you'd be

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:40.648
dead like them!

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:44.152
Thanks, cuz! I love you too.

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:52.427
Okay, boys, get me Harry Fluder.

01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:54.462
F-I-u-d-e-r.

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.364
Flounder? Fluder?

01:13:57.399 --> 01:13:58.466
Just find him.

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.570
- Tell me you didn't fuck his wife.
- I didn't fuck his wife.

01:14:02.572 --> 01:14:03.738
Promise me you didn't
fuck his wife.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.473
I promise.

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:07.341
- I might of touched a boob.
- What?

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:12.146
We have two minutes to Keyser
Soze the fuck out of here.

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:13.915
Okay, well, what are we gonna
do about your drugs?

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:15.383
They're not my drugs!

01:14:15.385 --> 01:14:16.451
We're gonna get rid of them.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:18.119
It's not exactly a carry-on.

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:19.187
Goddamn it.

01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:23.925
- What can I do?
- I don't know. Get a plunger or something.

01:14:23.927 --> 01:14:25.026
- Something...
- Okay, all right.

01:14:25.028 --> 01:14:26.093
Maybe a hanger?

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:30.264
This is what I got.

01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:31.732
We can't fuck the drugs away.

01:14:31.734 --> 01:14:33.067
It's all I have right now, man.

01:14:38.341 --> 01:14:39.407
Let me try. Let me try.

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.752
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:54.555
- Fuck man.
- Is everything a fucking joke to you?

01:14:54.557 --> 01:14:56.958
Can you even comprehend the
situation that we're in right now?

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.227
Oh, now is when I bet you tell
me that this is all my fault.

01:14:59.229 --> 01:15:01.095
Yes! Of course
this is your fault!

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:03.297
Who else's fault could it be?

01:15:03.299 --> 01:15:04.398
News flash.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.666
You're not Ferris Bueller.

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:07.068
You're just a fucking asshole.

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.068
Oh, fuck you, man.

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:11.072
Now is when it comes out? I spend
my whole life looking after you.

01:15:11.074 --> 01:15:13.474
Fucking showing you the time of your
life and this is the thanks I get?

01:15:13.476 --> 01:15:15.176
Oh, oh, sorry did
you want me to thank you?

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.011
- Yes.
- Okay, I'm sorry, thank you.

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:20.448
Thank you for turning my life
into a complete and utter

01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:22.450
fuck-a-palooza.

01:15:22.452 --> 01:15:25.286
None of this was about showing
me the time of my life.

01:15:25.288 --> 01:15:26.968
This is about you not having
to live yours.

01:15:27.789 --> 01:15:29.190
See, you don't want me
to grow up

01:15:29.192 --> 01:15:30.258
because you're afraid

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:31.659
that I'll leave you behind.

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:34.128
That's why you're always pulling
some epically stupid shit.

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:37.871
Well, I'm tired of you
always dragging me down.

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:40.695
That's what you really think?

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:43.004
Yeah.

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:46.674
Fuck you.

01:15:47.776 --> 01:15:49.710
You're not my
best friend anymore.

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:51.312
You're not my best friend
anymore either.

01:15:55.984 --> 01:15:57.544
We really gotta start
locking this door.

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:05.426
Hiya, boys.

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:07.895
Long time no see!

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:10.398
All right, so, uh...

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.566
Let's cut right to the chase.

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:15.202
You know me.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.905
And I

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:19.106
know you who you are.

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:23.945
Harry fluder, 5220 Archer road.

01:16:23.947 --> 01:16:25.012
And...

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.518
Beauregard Pemberton.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.919
Beauregard.

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:33.154
The fourth?

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:36.958
There are four of you!

01:16:37.859 --> 01:16:39.360
Yeah, uh...

01:16:39.362 --> 01:16:40.895
302 southwest east,
third street.

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:43.965
- Ah, bingo.
- Ah.

01:16:43.967 --> 01:16:47.802
So I want to apologize for any
discomfort my guys may have caused you.

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:50.938
Um, can I get you anything?

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:53.074
Uh, we're fine.

01:16:53.076 --> 01:16:54.241
Actually, uh,

01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:55.309
I'd love a sparkling water.

01:16:55.311 --> 01:16:56.377
Sure.

01:16:56.379 --> 01:16:57.945
Get him a sparkling water.

01:16:57.947 --> 01:16:59.747
Oh, ah, with a lemon wedge?

01:16:59.749 --> 01:17:00.815
Lemon wedge coming up.

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:04.685
I mean, he's asking.

01:17:04.687 --> 01:17:05.786
So...

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:07.521
You didn't just bring us here
to kills us?

01:17:07.523 --> 01:17:09.624
No, why would I do that?

01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:12.193
I don't know. 'Cause, like,
we could go to the cops.

01:17:12.195 --> 01:17:14.562
I have a cousin who works in the FBI.
I can tell him about...

01:17:14.564 --> 01:17:15.663
Are you actively trying
to get us shot?

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:17.965
No, you're not those
kind of guys.

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:20.801
No, we are not those type of guys.
No.

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:22.103
Your cousin's a security guard.

01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:23.604
Yeah, but at the FBI.

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:26.073
How is it?

01:17:27.909 --> 01:17:29.110
It's a little warm.

01:17:29.112 --> 01:17:30.411
Can I get some ice?

01:17:30.413 --> 01:17:31.479
Sure.

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:34.148
What the fuck?

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:37.318
- You didn't even make it in.
- We're done here.

01:17:39.087 --> 01:17:40.407
Make sure you stay
out of trouble.

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:43.157
So, that's it?

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:45.059
You're just gonna...

01:17:45.061 --> 01:17:46.127
Forget about it?

01:17:49.532 --> 01:17:50.965
There is one thing.

01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:54.735
Uh, you guys got ahold of a
suitcase that belonged to me.

01:17:54.737 --> 01:17:55.803
That suitcase.

01:17:57.105 --> 01:17:59.306
Which was filled with drugs.

01:17:59.308 --> 01:18:01.008
Now, not so much.

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.787
There's still a lot of drugs
in there, though.

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:04.245
You owe me money.

01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:05.813
Secondly,

01:18:05.815 --> 01:18:06.881
you've seen my face.

01:18:07.816 --> 01:18:09.083
I've admitted

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:11.285
that those drugs belong to me.

01:18:11.287 --> 01:18:13.821
Now, there are only
two types of people

01:18:13.823 --> 01:18:15.456
that can see this kind of stuff.

01:18:15.757 --> 01:18:17.191
A,

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:19.260
people that work for me and,

01:18:19.262 --> 01:18:20.561
B...

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:25.232
Oh!

01:18:27.302 --> 01:18:29.603
You just cut them up and
carry them around in a bag?

01:18:29.605 --> 01:18:32.973
Yeah, I thought step two of
murder was get rid of the body!

01:18:32.975 --> 01:18:35.710
I'm senior staff,
I don't do the cutting.

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:38.145
Plus, I was trying
to make a point.

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:40.848
Point taken,
you fucking psycho. Relax.

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:42.383
Okay, now listen.

01:18:42.385 --> 01:18:42.383
I've got good news.

01:18:42.385 --> 01:18:47.988
There seems to be an immediate opening
in my organization available.

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:50.591
If you work for me
and do one job,

01:18:50.593 --> 01:18:51.673
you won't owe me any money.

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:54.395
Or B...

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:56.197
You can, you know...

01:18:56.199 --> 01:18:57.264
I have an empty bag.

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.569
Could you just give us

01:19:01.571 --> 01:19:03.637
one minute to discuss this
between ourselves?

01:19:03.639 --> 01:19:04.899
Sure, take your time.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.743
Okay, could everybody turn
around and cover their ears?

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:10.564
No, that's not gonna happen.

01:19:12.714 --> 01:19:15.149
- Okay, we'll just whisper.
- Okay.

01:19:15.151 --> 01:19:17.685
I don't think this is the kind of
guy we want to be indebted too.

01:19:17.687 --> 01:19:19.620
Yeah, but I don't think we really
have a choice. Look at him.

01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:21.722
All white.
What is it Easter right now?

01:19:21.724 --> 01:19:22.923
He's fucking crazy.

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:24.759
- Haven't you seen <i>the godfather?</i>
- Yeah.

01:19:24.761 --> 01:19:27.762
There may be a day, where I come
in and ask you for a favor.

01:19:27.764 --> 01:19:30.397
Oh, my god, Harry, that
impression was fucking spot on.

01:19:30.399 --> 01:19:31.866
I've been sitting on that one
for a while.

01:19:31.868 --> 01:19:33.901
- I thought it was appropriate.
- It was totally appropriate.

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:35.903
You've been crushing this whole
vacation with these impressions.

01:19:35.905 --> 01:19:37.037
I didn't know you had it in you.

01:19:37.039 --> 01:19:38.839
- Thanks man.
- I still fucking hate you though.

01:19:38.841 --> 01:19:39.940
I still fucking hate you too.

01:19:39.942 --> 01:19:41.242
There's no way this guy
really trusts us,

01:19:41.244 --> 01:19:42.877
so he's not gonna give
us a big job.

01:19:42.879 --> 01:19:45.713
I bet it's some, like, victimless
mundane crime. I'm positive.

01:19:45.715 --> 01:19:47.548
Okay, we talked about it.
We're gonna do it.

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:48.949
- What... what, no!
- Excellent.

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.084
Great.

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:51.619
Good choice.

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:54.188
I need you to, uh,

01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:56.290
take care of somebody for me.

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:59.059
Uh, you know,
not my wife, just...

01:19:59.061 --> 01:20:00.127
That one.

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:02.797
What did she do?

01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:04.598
Nothing really...

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:07.635
I mean, accidentally, she saw
something she shouldn't have.

01:20:07.637 --> 01:20:09.937
I've been agonizing
over this, really.

01:20:09.939 --> 01:20:13.741
But, uh, I can't very well ask
her to whack herself, right?

01:20:13.743 --> 01:20:17.578
So, listen. Vito and Nickie
are gonna kinda tag along,

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:20.181
right, make sure
nothing goes wrong.

01:20:20.183 --> 01:20:21.749
Then, you're free to go.

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:24.885
And thanks, fellas.

01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:27.188
You're really taking
a load off my mind.

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:31.792
Yeah, thanks for the water.

01:20:31.794 --> 01:20:33.460
JK, it fucking sucks.

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:37.832
Honestly, that could
have gone way worse.

01:20:37.834 --> 01:20:39.200
What are you talking about?

01:20:39.202 --> 01:20:41.569
Dude, we just had a meeting
with Vincent Gambazzo

01:20:41.571 --> 01:20:43.871
in an abandoned warehouse
and he let us go.

01:20:43.873 --> 01:20:46.307
- Yeah, to kill Colette.
- We're not gonna have to kill Colette.

01:20:46.309 --> 01:20:47.842
We're just gotta get in
a couple of good

01:20:47.844 --> 01:20:48.909
punches!

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:52.680
Huh. Fuck!

01:20:54.282 --> 01:20:56.116
We're gonna
have to kill Colette.

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:10.130
Hey, Hun.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.434
Just finished my sudoku game.

01:21:13.436 --> 01:21:16.737
And I think I just figured out
the secret to cold fusion.

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:19.406
Oh yeah?

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:22.076
I know, the patent alone
could be worth billions.

01:21:22.078 --> 01:21:24.238
Anyway, I was thinking maybe
we could watch the sunset,

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:28.816
and then, practice the last
half of the Kama-Sutra.

01:21:29.751 --> 01:21:31.285
That sounds great.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.368
All right, I was wrong, man.

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:49.737
This is bad.

01:21:49.739 --> 01:21:51.472
This is real fucking bad.

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:56.977
How are we supposed
to go through with this?

01:21:56.979 --> 01:21:58.812
Yeah, man. How many
people have you killed?

01:21:58.814 --> 01:22:01.916
None. But my gun has killed a bunch.
Allegedly.

01:22:03.019 --> 01:22:04.351
How are we even
supposed to find her?

01:22:04.353 --> 01:22:06.186
Don't worry, she'll turn up.

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:08.689
Hey, guys.

01:22:09.057 --> 01:22:10.257
Kenny!

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:11.825
Kenny!

01:22:11.827 --> 01:22:13.861
Kenny! Kenny's here.

01:22:13.863 --> 01:22:15.529
- Hi, hi. Hi.
- Kenny!

01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:16.597
Okay.

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:18.666
Uh, anyway, I'm having
a party at the house.

01:22:18.668 --> 01:22:20.267
You know how those are,
Ragers, wouldn't want

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:22.569
the belles of the ball
to miss it.

01:22:22.571 --> 01:22:25.105
Who are your friends? Look at these
guys, look at them. Matching set.

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:26.340
Big and tall.

01:22:26.342 --> 01:22:28.275
Strong, silent type. Okay.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:30.377
- All right, I get it. You're digging in.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

01:22:30.379 --> 01:22:32.613
Playing hard to get, huh,
mount Olympus?

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:34.281
Can't wait to climb you.

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:35.683
Both!

01:22:36.986 --> 01:22:38.519
Gotta hose you off.

01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:40.621
Let's save that for when the
sun goes down, at least.

01:22:40.623 --> 01:22:40.621
- Come one.
- I have a big appetite.

01:22:40.623 --> 01:22:43.290
I know, I'm stuffed though,
we got to get out of here.

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:47.127
All right.

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:49.530
I'll kill her.
I'm gonna do it.

01:22:49.532 --> 01:22:50.631
What are you talking about?

01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:52.132
I need a beer if I'm gonna
murder someone.

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:53.534
Is that all right?

01:22:53.536 --> 01:22:55.502
- Okay.
- What do you want? What type of beer do you guys like?

01:22:55.504 --> 01:22:55.502
Just water.

01:22:55.504 --> 01:23:00.007
Just water? I thought you guys
were murderers, don't be pussies.

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:04.011
Here you go.
Water for the gentlemen.

01:23:04.013 --> 01:23:06.213
Important to stay hydrated.

01:23:10.752 --> 01:23:12.219
We can't kill her.

01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:15.022
What are we supposed to do? Just
wait and see if she shows up?

01:23:15.024 --> 01:23:16.156
If she shows up.

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:17.391
I don't know, Harry.
I just don't fucking know

01:23:17.393 --> 01:23:19.153
what I'm doing.
Just going with it right now.

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:20.494
Hi.

01:23:20.862 --> 01:23:22.329
Oh, shit.

01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:24.965
Um, I was just going to go for a
dive, you know, clear my head.

01:23:24.967 --> 01:23:26.033
Look for the Kraken.

01:23:27.702 --> 01:23:30.104
Sorry. Change of plans.

01:23:43.719 --> 01:23:45.219
You should zip up your suit.

01:24:01.002 --> 01:24:04.438
Wow, you know, I really like what
you guys have done with the place.

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.839
Do you guys summer here?

01:24:05.841 --> 01:24:08.842
No, this is where we keep
the oars, propellers...

01:24:08.844 --> 01:24:10.411
Dead bodies.

01:24:11.479 --> 01:24:12.613
Go ahead.

01:24:20.455 --> 01:24:21.688
No, no, no.

01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:22.923
Sorry.

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:31.098
What if I don't do it?

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.000
Then I shoot your friend.

01:24:33.002 --> 01:24:34.768
What if I'm okay with that?

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:36.336
Listen, either you do it,

01:24:36.338 --> 01:24:39.339
or we shoot you both and use
your hand to shoot her.

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.980
Harry, wait, there's time.
There's still time.

01:24:46.982 --> 01:24:49.583
Hey guys, let me tell you this
quick story about a young boy

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:51.385
and his unbridled love
of <i> guns n' roses.</i>

01:24:51.387 --> 01:24:52.553
Would you like to hear that...

01:24:52.555 --> 01:24:54.088
- Shut the fuck up!
- You shut the fuck up!

01:24:54.090 --> 01:24:55.255
You know there are
bullets in that thing.

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:56.723
Shut the fuck up about this...

01:24:56.725 --> 01:24:58.125
Wait! Wait!

01:24:58.127 --> 01:24:59.393
Just hold on a second.

01:24:59.395 --> 01:25:00.961
I gotta say something.

01:25:01.463 --> 01:25:02.930
Bowie.

01:25:02.932 --> 01:25:04.498
I didn't mean
what I said before.

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:06.567
You don't bring me down.

01:25:06.569 --> 01:25:08.735
Some of the best times I ever
had have been with you, man.

01:25:08.737 --> 01:25:09.837
Yeah?

01:25:09.839 --> 01:25:10.971
You remember that time,

01:25:10.973 --> 01:25:12.840
we waited outside
Fred durst's hotel

01:25:12.842 --> 01:25:14.522
just so he could sign our
red Yankees caps.

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:16.977
He was
such a fucking dick to us.

01:25:16.979 --> 01:25:18.712
Or the first time
we smoked grass.

01:25:18.714 --> 01:25:19.947
It wasn't really weed.

01:25:19.949 --> 01:25:21.782
It was actual grass
but we still pretended

01:25:21.784 --> 01:25:23.183
that we were high
for three days.

01:25:24.587 --> 01:25:26.954
Look, I don't care
what you do for a living.

01:25:27.922 --> 01:25:29.590
You're my best friend.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.261
You're not my best friend.

01:25:35.397 --> 01:25:37.164
'Cause you're my brother, man.

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:39.766
I love you.

01:25:41.936 --> 01:25:43.937
Are you crying?

01:25:43.939 --> 01:25:45.906
If I am, it's
only 'cause of this gun.

01:25:45.908 --> 01:25:47.307
Are you crying?

01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:53.013
That's a beautiful friendship,
right there.

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:57.050
Okay, no. Look, I've had
enough of whatever this is.

01:25:57.052 --> 01:25:58.585
- Time's up.
- Fuck you!

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:02.856
Fuck.

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:17.738
Damn it!

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:20.674
Okay, you guys are free to go.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:22.576
Yeah, it's a good job.

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:50.237
It's done, boss.

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:51.872
Good.

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:54.074
All right.

01:26:54.076 --> 01:26:56.710
Look, get everybody back here.
We're leaving in about...

01:26:57.579 --> 01:26:58.779
Two hours.

01:26:59.914 --> 01:27:02.015
Yeah. Wait a minute. Um,

01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:05.185
bring me back a sandwich.

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:08.021
I don't care.
Surprise me.

01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:10.023
But no onions.

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:18.632
Where the hell is everybody?

01:27:18.634 --> 01:27:22.202
Oh. Hey guys, let's go,
I want to get out of here.

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.174
Hey, daddy.

01:27:27.976 --> 01:27:30.978
Oh, you want to arrest me?

01:27:31.613 --> 01:27:32.679
Mmm-hmm.

01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:34.982
Good.

01:27:34.984 --> 01:27:38.619
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:27:38.621 --> 01:27:42.022
I've been wanting
to do this all week.

01:27:42.024 --> 01:27:46.126
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

01:27:48.764 --> 01:27:50.764
Careful, honey.
I got a glass chin.

01:27:51.165 --> 01:27:52.633
Ah!

01:27:52.635 --> 01:27:55.002
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:27:55.004 --> 01:27:58.572
Oh baby, the things
I'm gonna do to you.

01:27:58.574 --> 01:28:01.308
Vincent Anthony Gambazzo,
you are under arrest

01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:03.277
for trafficking illegal
narcotics,

01:28:03.279 --> 01:28:05.646
racketeering and
conspiracy to commit murder.

01:28:06.147 --> 01:28:07.914
What? Ow! Hey!

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:10.450
Come here.

01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:12.452
Put your hands behind your head.

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:14.621
What the fuck is going on?

01:28:15.423 --> 01:28:16.890
You've got nothing on me.

01:28:16.892 --> 01:28:18.792
- What do you do it so tight?
- Put your hands behind your back.

01:28:18.794 --> 01:28:20.754
Does the name Colette Weller
mean anything to you?

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:22.162
Um, no.

01:28:22.164 --> 01:28:23.664
How about Harry fluder?

01:28:23.666 --> 01:28:25.599
- Bowie Pemberton?
- Doesn't ring a bell.

01:28:25.601 --> 01:28:26.667
Really?

01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:28.802
'Cause that's
not what they have to say.

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:32.873
Never heard of us.

01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:34.007
Really?

01:28:34.009 --> 01:28:35.609
Beauregard, remember?

01:28:35.611 --> 01:28:37.611
Lemon water, you thought
we were gay. Come on dude.

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:39.479
Oh, these guys?

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:40.947
No, I'm sorry, my bad.

01:28:40.949 --> 01:28:42.182
I'm bad with names.

01:28:42.184 --> 01:28:45.719
Yeah, I know these guys. They've
been guests on my boat.

01:28:45.721 --> 01:28:47.821
So, you're telling me
that I'm under arrest

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:50.190
for killing three people
that aren't dead?

01:28:50.692 --> 01:28:51.758
Yes, I am.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.193
You should be indicted

01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:56.263
for conspiring to be an idiot.

01:28:56.265 --> 01:28:58.632
<i>I need you to take care
of somebody for me.</i>

01:28:58.634 --> 01:29:00.500
<i>Um, you know,
not my wife, just...</i>

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:03.003
<i>That one. And thanks, fellas.</i>

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:06.873
<i>You're really taking
a load off my mind.</i>

01:29:06.875 --> 01:29:08.241
And that's not even half of it.

01:29:08.243 --> 01:29:09.710
And I've got it all here.

01:29:09.712 --> 01:29:12.212
Enough to put your sad,
soft dick in prison.

01:29:12.214 --> 01:29:13.980
Wait. How did you get
that recording?

01:29:13.982 --> 01:29:17.017
Well, talk about blowjobs
anywhere near a guy's dick and

01:29:17.019 --> 01:29:20.153
<i>I could have tattooed a
rainbow unicorn on you,</i>

01:29:20.155 --> 01:29:21.288
<i>and you
never would have noticed.</i>

01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:23.523
Just stop me, it's a bad habit.

01:29:23.525 --> 01:29:23.523
Oh, oh.

01:29:23.525 --> 01:29:27.494
It's also the least thoroughly
searched area in a pat down.

01:29:27.496 --> 01:29:29.229
All right, come
on guys. Let's go.

01:29:30.064 --> 01:29:31.365
Hold on to me.

01:29:31.367 --> 01:29:32.766
If I trip, I'll sue you.

01:29:32.768 --> 01:29:35.369
Who gives a shit, these are
so fucking tight.

01:29:35.371 --> 01:29:38.739
You know what? You're all uninvited to
my party in the Hamptons, you hear me?

01:29:38.741 --> 01:29:41.408
We also had
Vincent's phone tapped.

01:29:41.410 --> 01:29:44.177
And we recorded this,
right after you guys left.

01:29:44.179 --> 01:29:45.445
<i>As soon as this two</i>

01:29:45.447 --> 01:29:47.414
<i>fuck-sticks are done
taking care of her,</i>

01:29:47.416 --> 01:29:49.783
<i>I want you to take care of them.</i>

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:51.585
<i>No loose ends.</i>

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:53.787
Whoa!

01:29:53.789 --> 01:29:55.021
That's pretty cool.

01:29:55.023 --> 01:29:56.556
They wanted to kill you.

01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:58.792
Yeah, but you knew about
it so, it's all right.

01:30:00.362 --> 01:30:01.928
The bug we had on you
only transmitted locally

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:03.730
so we had no idea
where they took you.

01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:06.500
Our guys couldn't pick you up until
after you called us from the mansion,

01:30:06.502 --> 01:30:07.782
so, how did you get
out of there?

01:30:08.136 --> 01:30:09.669
Oh, so,

01:30:09.671 --> 01:30:11.638
you weren't really
that careful about it.

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:13.206
Could have got killed.

01:30:13.208 --> 01:30:14.541
Okay, here is what happened.

01:30:14.543 --> 01:30:15.809
All right,

01:30:15.811 --> 01:30:19.946
I can never remember, do we do
this like a burrito or a crepe?

01:30:19.948 --> 01:30:21.515
What's the difference?

01:30:21.517 --> 01:30:23.250
Well, burrito's folded
into a pocket

01:30:23.252 --> 01:30:25.018
but stuff spills out the bottom.

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:26.787
Whereas, a crepe,
you just fold over

01:30:26.789 --> 01:30:28.889
and it spills out the top.

01:30:28.891 --> 01:30:31.091
Why don't we just roll her
up like a Taquito, then?

01:30:31.093 --> 01:30:33.527
No, see, you're thinking
of a blintz, I think.

01:30:33.529 --> 01:30:34.961
Ah,

01:30:34.963 --> 01:30:36.229
maybe, maybe we'll do, oh...

01:30:36.231 --> 01:30:38.198
Oh... maybe we'll do it
like a hot...

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:39.666
Hot pocket.

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:41.201
Kick.

01:30:41.203 --> 01:30:42.602
Hum...

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:44.571
How are you doing that
with your eyes?

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:48.942
How are you doing
that with your arm?

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:51.545
I'm not sure.

01:30:52.046 --> 01:30:53.146
Ah.

01:30:53.148 --> 01:30:54.214
Oh.

01:30:55.249 --> 01:30:56.783
Is that a ninja

01:30:56.785 --> 01:30:57.951
or a samurai?

01:31:00.055 --> 01:31:02.689
Damn it! I would have had
a really cool one liner

01:31:02.691 --> 01:31:04.057
about how bad-ass
that just looked

01:31:04.059 --> 01:31:05.692
if my brain wasn't so fucking
muddled with terror,

01:31:05.694 --> 01:31:08.829
on account you just killed
Colette like a son of a bitch.

01:31:08.831 --> 01:31:11.264
Aw! Did anyone Oder
an ass whopping?

01:31:11.266 --> 01:31:12.999
That would have
been perfect, damn it!

01:31:13.001 --> 01:31:14.201
Sorry, it's
not important to what we're

01:31:14.203 --> 01:31:15.469
talking about right now, though.

01:31:15.471 --> 01:31:15.469
Bowie!

01:31:15.471 --> 01:31:18.672
Why the fuck did you do that?
I was trying to buy us time.

01:31:18.674 --> 01:31:21.274
I drugged those two assholes, we
just needed two more minutes.

01:31:21.276 --> 01:31:23.109
- Bowie!
- No, don't bowie me, man.

01:31:23.111 --> 01:31:23.109
We just made up
and now I'm going to have to

01:31:23.111 --> 01:31:27.147
fucking testify against you in court.
They're going to say, "who was it?"

01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:29.182
And I'm not a liar. So, I'm
gonna have to point at you

01:31:29.184 --> 01:31:30.851
and I'm gonna have to say,
"it was fucking Harry."

01:31:30.853 --> 01:31:32.152
Bowie!

01:31:32.154 --> 01:31:33.320
Holy shit, Colette!

01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:35.288
You okay?

01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:36.623
Why are you not dead?

01:31:36.625 --> 01:31:38.024
I mean, I'm really
glad you're not dead,

01:31:38.026 --> 01:31:40.560
but why the fuck
are you not dead?

01:31:40.562 --> 01:31:43.830
Fuck squid. They are like
the assholes of the ocean.

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:47.167
That's why all the deep-sea divers
had to wear those special wet suits

01:31:47.169 --> 01:31:49.209
it had so much chain-mail
on it, it was basically...

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:51.605
Bullet-proof.

01:31:51.607 --> 01:31:52.706
You knew it!

01:31:52.708 --> 01:31:54.174
So, you're
not just like a murderer.

01:31:57.212 --> 01:31:58.345
You should zip up your suit.

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.180
Trust me.

01:32:00.848 --> 01:32:01.982
Okay.

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:12.726
This is big, Harry.

01:32:12.728 --> 01:32:14.227
I am fucking jacked up
right now.

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:15.795
You okay?

01:32:15.797 --> 01:32:16.863
Yeah, yeah.

01:32:17.265 --> 01:32:18.698
Good shot.

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:20.166
I was aiming for your leg.

01:32:20.535 --> 01:32:21.735
Never mind.

01:32:21.737 --> 01:32:21.735
This is great.

01:32:21.737 --> 01:32:25.972
Isn't this great? Look around. Look
at what we did. This is so great.

01:32:25.974 --> 01:32:27.374
Where did you get the drugs?

01:32:27.376 --> 01:32:28.441
Oh, dude.

01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:30.544
It was Kenny.

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:32.178
Guys!

01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:33.280
Kenny!

01:32:33.282 --> 01:32:34.414
Kenny!

01:32:34.416 --> 01:32:35.749
Kenny!

01:32:35.751 --> 01:32:37.484
Good to see Kenny!

01:32:37.486 --> 01:32:39.152
Kenny, we're in trouble,
do you have mints?

01:32:39.154 --> 01:32:40.854
- Back pocket.
- Oh, Kenny!

01:32:41.722 --> 01:32:43.890
- Hi, hi. Hi.
- Kenny!

01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:49.629
Here. Water for the gentlemen.

01:32:49.631 --> 01:32:50.931
Important to stay hydrated.

01:32:51.766 --> 01:32:53.767
Ow, ow, gentle, gentle!
Oh, god.

01:32:53.769 --> 01:32:55.969
I can't believe you
fucking did it, man.

01:32:55.971 --> 01:32:58.271
Yeah, yeah, can we just
get out of here? Wait.

01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:02.709
I have an idea.

01:33:05.479 --> 01:33:07.280
Is this really necessary?

01:33:07.282 --> 01:33:09.683
Told you I wouldn't be
caught dead in those clothes.

01:33:12.186 --> 01:33:13.353
Watch you head, Colette.

01:33:16.924 --> 01:33:17.991
Son of a...

01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:34.741
It's done, boss.

01:33:34.743 --> 01:33:36.676
Scientifically speaking,
what we did is called

01:33:36.678 --> 01:33:38.311
Crocodile Dundeeii-ing.

01:33:38.313 --> 01:33:40.347
This is where he switches
clothes with the bad guy

01:33:40.349 --> 01:33:42.983
so that the other bad guys shoot
their boss instead of him.

01:33:43.818 --> 01:33:45.118
Wow!

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.319
I've got to say, I'm...

01:33:46.321 --> 01:33:47.520
I'm impressed.

01:33:47.522 --> 01:33:48.655
What do you say, like,

01:33:48.657 --> 01:33:50.137
maybe when we get
back to the mainland

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:52.058
go on like, a date?

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:55.362
You seem like a pretty nice guy.

01:33:55.963 --> 01:33:57.497
I know, thanks.

01:33:57.499 --> 01:33:58.798
So, how should I put this?

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.467
Um... mmm!

01:34:00.469 --> 01:34:02.502
- You see that, right there?
- Yeah.

01:34:02.504 --> 01:34:06.072
I'd rather shove that up my
ass and pull it out my vagina

01:34:06.074 --> 01:34:07.307
than do anything with you.

01:34:08.009 --> 01:34:10.610
Whoa!

01:34:10.612 --> 01:34:12.612
What a grosso!

01:34:12.614 --> 01:34:13.980
What a fuckin' nut!

01:34:13.982 --> 01:34:15.248
Did you hear that?

01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:17.350
Oh yeah, we heard all that.

01:34:17.352 --> 01:34:19.152
Oh my god, man.

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:21.955
I think I'm in love, I bet
she's into some weird shit.

01:34:21.957 --> 01:34:23.256
Wait! Hold on! I love you!

01:34:23.258 --> 01:34:24.691
Match made in heaven.

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:28.161
Well, um,

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:29.629
it was really great meeting you.

01:34:29.631 --> 01:34:30.897
Thanks for shooting me.

01:34:31.298 --> 01:34:31.297
You're welcome.

01:34:31.299 --> 01:34:36.136
Now, if you ask me if I've ever killed
someone, I can say that I tried.

01:34:36.138 --> 01:34:39.005
Yeah, how about next time,
we overthrow a dictator.

01:34:39.007 --> 01:34:41.107
Or, yeah, we could stop
a bank robbery.

01:34:41.575 --> 01:34:42.842
Yeah.

01:34:43.878 --> 01:34:45.311
Or just play it by ear.

01:34:46.914 --> 01:34:49.916
That would really mess
with my plans.

01:34:49.918 --> 01:34:51.618
Hey! Where are
you going? Freeze!

01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:52.686
I'll get you, you bitch.

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:07.834
Whoa!

01:35:09.738 --> 01:35:11.137
Oh no!

01:35:11.139 --> 01:35:12.939
Was that the first time
you guys were gonna...

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:14.674
I ruined it.

01:35:14.676 --> 01:35:15.875
Shit!

01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:17.744
Okay, well, keep
going and all that.

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:19.746
You guys are cute!

01:35:20.214 --> 01:35:21.414
Hi.

01:35:32.094 --> 01:35:35.295
- Help, help.
- All right, I got you.

01:35:36.897 --> 01:35:39.265
Dude, that trip was
exactly what I needed.

01:35:39.267 --> 01:35:40.800
You know what?

01:35:40.802 --> 01:35:42.168
Me too.

01:35:42.170 --> 01:35:44.003
- For real?
- Yeah, man, I feel great.

01:35:44.005 --> 01:35:46.406
I like this new Harry, man.
What are going to do now?

01:35:46.408 --> 01:35:49.409
Oh, I got this text
on the plane.

01:35:49.411 --> 01:35:52.245
I guess I should just
probably go back in to work.

01:35:53.348 --> 01:35:54.748
Dude, I haven't
got shit, this week.

01:35:55.116 --> 01:35:56.449
I'm coming.

01:35:56.451 --> 01:35:58.585
I still have no idea
what you do for work.

01:35:58.587 --> 01:36:00.754
I work hard, man, what else
do you need to know?

01:36:01.305 --> 01:36:07.171
