There are people who come

[ Michael Narrating] Calling the cops
on someone can teachyou a lot.

02:31.851 --> 02:35.719

than patient, Mr. Westen.

I was willing to meetyou in a public park,

I hope I don't have to remind
you that my recommendation...

you know they're in charge.

who burned me recently.

07:22.308 --> 07:25.072

about this job...

thatyou own them,you know?

Once a kidnapperknows you're onto him...

- No.

So our only hope is to find Dawn before they
find out we don't have five million dollars.

[Michael Narrating] The art ofturning
someone into a double agent is delicate.

It's always easier to turn someone who works
for a criminal gang into a double agent.

16:01.586 --> 16:05.647
The more secretive and ruthless
their side is, the better.

16:05.723 --> 16:09.989

disloyalty will get them killed by their own people.

16:10.061 --> 16:12.825
Lucio, you need to thi nk about
your situation very carefully.

16:12.897 --> 16:17.334

middle ofa delicate assignment.

16:17.401 --> 16:20.996

- you're about to give to the F.B.I.
- No, no, no, no.

What doyou need it for?

18:31.602 --> 18:35.129
We need to find where Dawn is being kept.
Lucio doesn't know.

18:35.206 --> 18:37.231
His job is just finding targets
for Reyes...

18:37.308 --> 18:39.299
so we're gonna have Lucio bring him
a new target--

18:39.377 --> 18:42.107
- a rich societywife.
- EnchantÃ©.

18:42.179 --> 18:44.238
- And a disgruntled bodyguard.
- Ya bitch.

18:44.315 --> 18:47.409
Talk to Reyes, tell him I'm willing
to help him pull the job.

18:47.485 --> 18:49.510
But he's gotta show me
where he keeps the hostages.

18:49.587 --> 18:54.024
Hopefully, they'll bring Sam
to where Dawn is and we can grab her.

18:54.091 --> 18:58.221

You've even got a fall guy
ifanything goes wrong.

19:38.135 --> 19:42.231
To a professional kidnapper,
a good man on the inside is worth a lot.

19:45.276 --> 19:48.871
And a bad man on the inside
is worth even more.

- Lucio.
- Okay, okay. I can't do this.

19:58.289 --> 20:00.917
Okay, man, I can't.
Reyes is gonna kill me if he finds out.

20:00.991 --> 20:05.587
Well, that's the point, Lucio. You do yourjob
well, he won't find out and you'll stay alive.

20:28.819 --> 20:31.413

isn't long enough.

Tell him Nick's family has
hired a hostage negotiator...

20:34.925 --> 20:36.950
and that the guywants
to talk to him in person.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.962
With Reyes? No, no. Come on.
You can't be serious.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.590
You convince him it's the best
way for him to get his money.

We just need to buy enough time
to find Dawn and then you're done, Lucio.

20:48.305 --> 20:51.103
- You'll do it?
- Do I got a choice?

20:51.175 --> 20:54.008
No, you don't. You got my number.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.875
[Michael Narrating]
The thing about doubling anyone...

20:55.946 --> 20:59.006
is that the more they do
foryou, the deeper theyget.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.779
The deeper they get,
the more you can make them do.

21:01.852 --> 21:04.480
Great ifyou're running them,
but hard on the source.

21:14.799 --> 21:18.291
I have worked with field
operatives before.

21:18.369 --> 21:20.963
I may find your priorities
somewhat baroque and unnecessary...

21:21.038 --> 21:23.233
but I suppose that's
why I work in an office...

21:23.307 --> 21:25.741
and you run around
the world with guns.

21:25.810 --> 21:27.744
I suppose so, yes.

21:27.812 --> 21:32.806
So, you've now had your opportunity
to screen me in public.

21:32.883 --> 21:37.411
Are you satisfied that I'm not some
shadow figure sent to liquidateyou?

21:37.488 --> 21:39.479
- Can we do our business now?
- Yes.

21:39.557 --> 21:43.220
Now, I have security
concerns of my own.

21:43.294 --> 21:46.058
As I'm sureyou're aware,
your case has certain issues...

21:46.130 --> 21:48.894
pertaining to
national security.

21:48.966 --> 21:52.561
Uh, issues that require
a private venue.

21:52.636 --> 21:55.434
Now my office in Fort
Lauderdale is more--

21:55.506 --> 21:58.771
I would not be able to make it up there
for at least a few days.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.878
That's unfortunate.

22:01.946 --> 22:05.211
Maybe this isn't important enough toyou,
Mr. Westen. I have to get back to D.C.

22:05.282 --> 22:09.184
You could come by my place
the night after tomorrow.

22:09.253 --> 22:12.484
You hope to gain some sort
ofhome court advantage?

22:12.556 --> 22:17.050

for the next few days for my dayjob.

on you, Mr. Chambers.

-You'd end up with nothing foryour trouble.
-How do I knowyou're not a cop?

- It comes down to howmuch we're
willing to move on the price.

37:06.211 --> 37:08.338
Seriously, bro. I don't even know
how to thankyou.

37:08.413 --> 37:12.315
- Uh, those surfboards right there--
- Yeah, I don't surf.

37:12.384 --> 37:15.353
Okay. You're awesome, bro.

37:15.420 --> 37:18.150
- [ Horn Honking]
- Sounds like they're here.

37:22.327 --> 37:25.785
All set, Mike. Hospital checked
her out. She's fine.

37:25.864 --> 37:27.889
- Is Nick here?
- He's inside.

37:27.966 --> 37:29.900
- You guys should talk.
- Okay.

37:31.770 --> 37:33.795
- Cakewalk, huh?
- Aw.

37:33.872 --> 37:37.865
- Look, Mike, ifyou everwant
to borrow my Caddy, uh, it's yours.
- Thanks.

37:37.942 --> 37:39.967
- Nick.
- Hey, babe.

37:40.045 --> 37:42.513
[ Grunts ]
You lied to me!

37:42.580 --> 37:44.605
- Baby, I love you.
- You lied to me!

37:48.186 --> 37:50.279
Another happy ending.

37:52.157 --> 37:54.091
Mr. Clark.

37:54.159 --> 37:57.094
I've never done a meeting in a private home
like this before, Mr. Westen.

37:57.162 --> 37:59.756
- Uh, I'm not even sure it's allowed.
- Thanks for bending the rules.

37:59.831 --> 38:02.026
Yeah, again, no guarantees,
Mr. Westen.

38:02.100 --> 38:04.034
Uh, we're gonna have
to cut this short.

38:04.102 --> 38:07.469
- You tell meyour side ofthe story,
I'll get back toyou.
- It shouldn't take long.

38:07.539 --> 38:10.565
- Good. Mywife's expecting me
to actually make my flight tonight.
- Great.

38:10.809 --> 38:15.439
[ Sighs ]
You have any coffee?

38:15.513 --> 38:18.414
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

38:18.483 --> 38:22.817
- I think I have some instant.
- That's fine.

38:22.887 --> 38:24.718
[Michael Narrating]
The longeryou've been in the game...

38:24.789 --> 38:28.020
the moreyou have to be careful
about underestimating an opponent.

38:28.093 --> 38:31.324
Sayyou don't think much ofbureaucrats,
don't feel they're worth your time or attention--

38:31.396 --> 38:33.864
[ Grunti ng ]

38:33.932 --> 38:38.062
Then a bureaucrat is the perfect
person to send to killyou.

38:38.136 --> 38:40.502
[ Grunti ng ]

38:45.276 --> 38:48.575
- Wow, you're pretty good.
- Let go.

38:48.646 --> 38:50.807
- I t'll be less painful foryou.
- [ Gasps ]

38:50.882 --> 38:53.874
It'll look like you
hanged yourself.

38:53.952 --> 38:56.386
No surprise, really.

38:56.454 --> 38:59.252
- No work, no money.
- [ Grunts ]

39:01.960 --> 39:06.192
This would have been easier ifyou'd
kept our appointment in Fort Lauderdale.

39:06.264 --> 39:09.461
I had some things arranged.
Oh, well.

39:09.534 --> 39:12.526
[Michael Narrating] There's
no wayto anticipate everydanger.

39:12.604 --> 39:16.301
You need a backup plan
forwhen things go wrong.

39:16.374 --> 39:20.970
[ Gasping ]
Sorry to inconvenience you.

39:21.045 --> 39:24.071
That's why home court advantage
is so important.

39:24.149 --> 39:27.915
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Gunshot ]

39:27.986 --> 39:31.945
[ Gasping, Coughing ]

39:49.174 --> 39:51.642
[ Gasps, Groans ]

39:58.516 --> 40:00.984
[ Sam ] Mike, the cops foundyour assassin
in an alley this morning.

40:01.052 --> 40:04.419
He bled to death.
No I.D. on him.

40:04.489 --> 40:05.557
His fingerprints didn't show up
in anygovernment database.

40:05.557 --> 40:07.752
His fingerprints didn't show up
in anygovernment database.

40:07.826 --> 40:09.760
So, officially, I guess the guy
never existed.

40:09.828 --> 40:12.160
Must have been impersonating
the real Perry Clark.

40:12.230 --> 40:16.098
- You thi nk that the guy who burned you sent him?
- Not a bad guess. Thanks, Sam.

40:17.535 --> 40:19.594
You were right about him,
you know?

40:19.671 --> 40:21.798
You must feel a little proud
ofyourself?

40:21.873 --> 40:26.435
I wanted my burn notice resolved,
talked myselfinto denying my instincts.

40:26.511 --> 40:29.309
That's nothing to be proud of.

40:29.380 --> 40:31.541
- I'm fine, Fi.
- You almost died.

40:31.616 --> 40:33.550
That's happened before.

40:34.752 --> 40:38.017
So I'm not allowed to be
concerned, to worry?

40:38.089 --> 40:40.319
You can worry about me.

40:40.391 --> 40:44.225
- Like Nickworried about Dawn?
- Hopefully, not exactly like that.

40:44.295 --> 40:46.320
Oh, he was head
over heels in love.

40:49.801 --> 40:53.532
I talked to him about you, about what
I should getyou foryour birthday.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.235
- A Makarov.
- He said you would like it.

41:05.783 --> 41:07.717
Is it the same?

41:07.785 --> 41:10.845
Nick convinced his boss
to sell it to me at a discount.

41:12.991 --> 41:15.687
Thankyou, Michael.

41:16.895 --> 41:19.659
Happy birthday, Fi.
