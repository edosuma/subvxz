are paid, they know... *

CHRIS ROCK:
By 1987, everybody
in the country

00:07.708 --> 00:09.143
had heard of rap music.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.445
And most kids either
wanted to be a DJ...

00:11.479 --> 00:13.514
* Said my woman
had it all arranged *

00:13.547 --> 00:15.449
...or an MC.

00:15.483 --> 00:18.219
Throw your hands in the air!

00:18.252 --> 00:19.753
Wave them like
you just don't care!

00:19.787 --> 00:22.456
But then something happened
to change it all...

00:22.490 --> 00:24.092
* Stick 'em,
ha-ha-ha, stick 'em *

00:24.125 --> 00:26.760
...the Fat Boys,
featuring the Human Beatbox.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.365
* We're the mind-blowing,
body-rocking... *

00:45.179 --> 00:46.680
Chris!

00:46.714 --> 00:48.349
What the hell
are you doing?

00:48.382 --> 00:49.783
Beatboxing. It's the new thing.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.320
Buffy the Human Beatbox
from the Fat Boys is the best.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.454
Best at what?

00:53.487 --> 00:55.123
Spitting all
over everything?

00:55.156 --> 00:56.424
He did say "spit," right?

00:56.457 --> 00:58.226
Is it okay if I leave
a little early today?

00:58.259 --> 00:59.460
The Fat Boys are coming to town,

00:59.493 --> 01:01.862
and I want to get there early
before the tickets sell out.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.097
Go on.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.732
But you're wasting
your money.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.667
I know a lady
that'll spit on you

01:06.700 --> 01:08.802
for half the price
of what them tickets cost you.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.704
Back then, you actually
had to leave your house

01:10.738 --> 01:12.340
to buy concert tickets.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.580
You're getting Fat
Boys tickets, too?

01:19.613 --> 01:21.715
Nah, I'm just holding
this dude's place in line.

01:21.749 --> 01:22.883
$1.50 an hour.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.752
I'll hold your spot, too,
if you want.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.687
Nah, that's okay.

01:26.720 --> 01:27.888
I'll wait in line.

01:27.921 --> 01:31.325
Uh, back of the line
is that way.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.740
Sold out? I've been waiting
in line for three hours.

01:46.774 --> 01:47.741
Could've been worse;

01:47.775 --> 01:48.809
could've been four.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.612
Look, all I have left
is Hall and Oates tickets.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.147
Do I look white?

01:55.183 --> 01:57.185
What's the matter?
You look depressed.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.453
I waited in line all day
yesterday for Fat Boys tickets,

01:59.487 --> 02:01.922
and just when I made it
to the store, they sold out.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.424
No problem.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.425
I got tickets.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.759
How?

02:09.797 --> 02:11.832
Sold out?!
But I've been waiting in line

02:11.865 --> 02:13.567
for Hall and Oates tickets
for three hours!

02:13.601 --> 02:15.569
Hall and Oates
wouldn't wait three hours

02:15.603 --> 02:16.804
for Hall and Oates tickets.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.906
All we got left
is Fat Boys tickets.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.177
Ah, what the heck,
I'll take two.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.283
Wait, this is
for the 10:30 show.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.184
So?

02:30.218 --> 02:31.685
18 and over only.

02:31.719 --> 02:32.820
How we supposed to get in?

02:32.853 --> 02:35.155
Easy, just wait
three more years.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.870
* Ah, make it funky now.

CHRIS ROCK:
I had two Fat Boys tickets.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.527
Now I had to get
two skinny boys to pass for 18.

03:13.561 --> 03:14.428
Look, I've been thinking.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.597
All I have to do is
get out of the house,

03:16.630 --> 03:18.799
then maybe we can find a way
to get into the show.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.001
Well, my mother will be drunk
and passed out by about 7:00.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.836
So getting out of the house
won't be a problem.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.505
I could be on tour
with Van Halen,

03:24.538 --> 03:25.573
and she wouldn't
even notice.

03:25.606 --> 03:26.974
Years later, Greg actually

03:27.007 --> 03:29.443
toured with Van Halen
for a year as a mic stand.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.678
All right, that's good.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.813
In terms of us going
to see The Fat Boys, yes.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.882
But in truth, alcohol abuse
is nothing to laugh at.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.950
And I'll be scarred forever
by my mother's tragic disease,

03:36.984 --> 03:37.851
but please, continue.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.953
All right, all I have
to do is get my mom

03:39.987 --> 03:42.323
to say it's okay to spend
the night at your house

03:42.356 --> 03:43.324
and that's half the battle.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.725
Wait, what's
the other half?

03:44.758 --> 03:46.360
Know anywhere we can
get some fake IDs?

03:46.394 --> 03:47.561
Fake IDs?

03:47.595 --> 03:48.729
Fake IDs.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.664
When you were a teenager,
fake IDs

03:50.698 --> 03:53.000
could open up
a whole new magical world.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.768
* Shake it up,
shake it up, whoo *

03:54.802 --> 03:55.869
* Shake that thing

03:55.903 --> 03:57.405
* I been working all week...

03:57.438 --> 04:00.374
Here you go, Mr. Testaverde.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.943
And Mr. Sharpton, your ID.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.345
* To find some mackin'...

04:04.378 --> 04:05.879
* But that don't thrill me

04:05.913 --> 04:07.915
* So I head to the Magic City
to get on, G *

04:07.948 --> 04:09.850
* I don't dance,
don't need to start frontin' *

04:09.883 --> 04:11.752
* I'm lookin' for a ...
that want to move something *

04:11.785 --> 04:13.654
* Know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm talking... *

04:13.687 --> 04:15.956
I got the tickets;
why do I have to get the IDs?

04:15.989 --> 04:18.326
Because if you get busted
trying to get fake IDs,

04:18.359 --> 04:19.760
you'll get community service.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.629
If I get busted,
I'm two jail cells down

04:21.662 --> 04:22.896
from that guy who shot Reagan.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.632
Meanwhile,
I wasn't the only one

04:24.665 --> 04:26.967
having problems
with my date of birth.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.936
Remember, I don't want
a party for my birthday.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.372
Don't worry.
You're not having a party.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.407
That's what the Democrats
said to Hillary.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.711
Hey, Ma, can I
sleep over at Greg's

04:37.745 --> 04:38.712
on Saturday night?
No.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.081
You can't go.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.516
I'm having a surprise party

04:42.550 --> 04:43.917
for your father
on Saturday night,

04:43.951 --> 04:45.419
and I need you to be here.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.620
But Dad's birthday's
not till Sunday.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.956
That's why it's called
a surprise party

04:48.989 --> 04:51.058
and not a
predictable party.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.793
I thought Dad
didn't even like parties.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.663
Boy, you have no idea
what your life would be like

04:55.696 --> 04:57.865
if I paid attention
to what your father liked.

04:57.898 --> 04:58.966
And neither does he.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.969
So here's what
I'm going to do.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.104
While my mother
made birthday plans,

05:04.137 --> 05:06.607
Drew made plans
to see birthday suits.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.041
Wow.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.477
Drew was trying
to get something

05:09.510 --> 05:10.478
every young boy wanted.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.613
X-ray glasses.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.914
Cool.

05:13.947 --> 05:17.385
I'm waiting for them to come
out with X-ray contact lenses.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.720
Back at school,
I was more depressed

05:19.753 --> 05:21.889
than the Fat Boys
at a finger sandwich party.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.123
My dad's surprise party
is Saturday night,

05:23.156 --> 05:25.092
and I don't know
how I'm gonna do that

05:25.125 --> 05:26.059
and see the
Fat Boys, too.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.696
So, surprise him.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.097
Don't be there.

05:30.130 --> 05:30.931
Look, I did my part.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.000
I can't get you
out of the house, too.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.635
You got the IDs?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.437
Is Janet Jackson in control?

05:36.470 --> 05:38.672
Yes, but Michael isn't.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.909
Let me guess, I'm Mr. T,
and you're George Peppard?

05:41.942 --> 05:43.143
Dude, they're free.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.144
What do you expect?

05:44.177 --> 05:46.580
See what you can do with this.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.048
I'm gonna work on
getting out the house.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.017
Since I couldn't make it
to the club

05:50.050 --> 05:53.921
and to my father's party, I had
to make sure one didn't happen.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.424
And I didn't need tickets
to see my father.

05:56.457 --> 05:57.491
Hey, Dad.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.426
What's up?

05:58.459 --> 05:59.993
I feel real horrible
about telling you this.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.662
No, you don't.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.531
You know how you didn't want
to celebrate your birthday?

06:04.532 --> 06:06.500
Mom's planning a surprise party
for you.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.601
What?!

06:07.635 --> 06:09.036
I told her
I didn't want a party.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.671
What, you mean
women don't listen?

06:10.704 --> 06:11.872
I know.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.674
She's gonna take you out
to go get some food,

06:13.707 --> 06:15.075
then when you get back,
everybody's gonna be here.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.712
Chris, I know it's hard for you

06:18.746 --> 06:21.582
to betray your mother's trust,
but I'm glad you did.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.418
And if she finds out, you can
regain her trust for free,

06:24.452 --> 06:26.454
but paying off a party
is gonna be expensive.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.622
Think she'll find out?

06:28.656 --> 06:31.625
I'll make sure she doesn't.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.434
ROCHELLE:
Mmm!

06:40.468 --> 06:42.470
Smells good.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.737
Is that Benny's Tacos?

06:43.771 --> 06:45.072
Mm-hmm.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.206
Wow.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.441
I haven't been there in ages.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.009
You know what?

06:49.042 --> 06:50.878
Since you don't want to
have a birthday party,

06:50.911 --> 06:52.480
maybe we could go
there on Saturday.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.081
You know, it's not
that expensive,

06:54.114 --> 06:55.215
and Chris can watch the kids.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.117
Honey, I know
what you're trying to do.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.219
I told you I don't want a party.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.155
How did you know
I was throwing you a party?

07:02.189 --> 07:03.223
Did Chris tell you?

07:03.256 --> 07:04.592
No.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.159
I'm not stupid, honey.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.028
And I appreciate you
wanting to celebrate with me,

07:08.061 --> 07:09.096
but I don't want a party.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.999
Well, if you don't want
to have a birthday party,

07:12.032 --> 07:13.867
what do I do when
my birthday comes around

07:13.901 --> 07:14.935
and I want to have a party?

07:14.968 --> 07:17.538
So this is all
so yo can have a party?

07:17.571 --> 07:18.672
Exactly.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.673
It's my birthday.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.074
What are we doing for me?

07:21.108 --> 07:23.644
Ironically, making you wish
you were never born.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.078
Julius, don't even try
to turn this around.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.147
If you don't want me
to have a party,

07:27.180 --> 07:28.181
just come out and say it!

07:28.215 --> 07:30.984
I didn't say I didn't want
you to have a party.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.721
It's not what you're saying,
but that's what you're saying.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.888
You know what?

07:34.922 --> 07:36.123
Fine, Julius.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.191
Do what you want.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.527
Happy birthday!

07:43.130 --> 07:45.065
You can go to Greg's
on Saturday.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.234
What about Dad's party?

07:47.267 --> 07:49.002
We're not having it.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.571
Why not?

07:50.604 --> 07:52.239
'Cause your
father's a jerk.

07:52.272 --> 07:55.643
The bad news is my parents
could get divorced.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.679
But the good news is
I get to see the Fat Boys.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.721
CHRIS ROCK:
Since I had handled
my part of the plan,

08:07.755 --> 08:08.956
now everything was up to Greg.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.090
I'm all set on my end.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.759
Did you have any luck
with the fake IDs?

08:11.792 --> 08:13.861
Does Boy George have luck
with women's clothing?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.865
Hey, these actually
look like us.
Yeah, I know.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.701
They are actually two
guys from Guatemala.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.881
You know, maybe
we should take these

08:33.914 --> 08:35.182
for a test drive
before the show.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.550
Oh, here's your change.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.619
Change as well?

08:40.654 --> 08:42.022
You go.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.197
You know what?

08:50.230 --> 08:52.099
I think I know
who we can talk to.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.233
Fake ID?

08:53.266 --> 08:55.869
Why would I know anything
about where to get a fake ID?

08:55.903 --> 08:58.005
Because you operate on
the fringes of the law.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.207
Hey, man, just because
somebody's name is Risky,

09:00.240 --> 09:02.275
and they operate
on the fringes of the law,

09:02.309 --> 09:03.777
does not mean
they break the law.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.045
Yes, it does.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.046
JAMES:
Yeah, man.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.247
Using fake IDs could get y'all

09:07.280 --> 09:08.281
in serious trouble.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.282
If I wasn't underage,

09:09.316 --> 09:10.584
who knows where I'd be now?

09:10.618 --> 09:12.152
So do you or don't you?

09:14.187 --> 09:17.224
Oh, hey, man, I think
I see Run-DMC outside!

09:17.257 --> 09:18.291
I don't see anybody.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.927
Well, maybe you should
go out there

09:19.960 --> 09:21.261
and make sure it wasn't them.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.263
Make sure who wasn't them?

09:23.296 --> 09:24.732
Man, would you
just go outside

09:24.765 --> 09:26.800
so he can tell you
where to get the ID?

09:26.834 --> 09:27.801
Man, you slow.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.970
Forget it.
Forget it.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.939
Go to this address,

09:31.972 --> 09:34.241
and tell them you want
a passport photo.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.309
Passport photo?

09:36.343 --> 09:39.246
That's code for "fake ID."

09:39.279 --> 09:40.614
Y'all slow.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.950
While I was trying
to break the law,

09:42.983 --> 09:45.252
my father was trying
to break the silence.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.154
So, how was your day?

09:51.224 --> 09:52.760
Rochelle, this is childish.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.262
Can you please
tell your father

09:55.295 --> 09:57.264
that I have nothing
to say to him.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.366
Mama said she has nothing
to say to you.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.037
Fine. Throw me a party.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.338
Oh!

10:05.372 --> 10:08.008
So now all of a sudden
you want to have a party.

10:08.041 --> 10:08.842
Well, it's too late.

10:08.876 --> 10:12.145
You just can't blow
some balloons up,

10:12.179 --> 10:13.380
set a cake on fire

10:13.413 --> 10:14.281
and start hollering.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.649
You have to plan
for a party.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.250
I mean, I have
to send out invitations,

10:17.284 --> 10:18.852
write out a guest list,

10:18.886 --> 10:20.287
make present
suggestions.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.155
Oh, no, no, you are not
putting me through all that.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.357
Nuh-uh. The next time
you want to have a party,

10:24.391 --> 10:26.126
you need to say something
ahead of time

10:26.159 --> 10:27.895
instead of always waiting
till the last minute!

10:29.062 --> 10:31.364
TONYA:
Mama said,

10:31.398 --> 10:32.432
"Oh!

10:32.465 --> 10:34.802
"So now all of a sudden
you want to have a party.

10:34.835 --> 10:35.903
"Well, it's too late.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.270
"You can't just blow up
some balloons,

10:37.304 --> 10:38.839
"set a cake on fire,
and start hollering.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.007
"You have to plan
for a party.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.308
"You have to invite
the people.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.276
"You have to invite the family
from out of town.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.945
"You have to get the cake.
You have to get the ice cream.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.980
You have to get toys for
the little kids to play with..."

10:47.014 --> 10:50.017
Since it's against the law
to choke children on film,

10:50.050 --> 10:51.284
we're gonna go
to the next scene.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.352
"No, you have to plan for it!"

10:54.421 --> 10:56.924
Meanwhile, Drew got
a special delivery

10:56.957 --> 10:58.959
from the see-through
women's clothing fairy.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.030
Cool.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.113
Oh, dang!

11:20.147 --> 11:21.348
Excuse me.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.083
I know this may
sound weird,

11:23.116 --> 11:26.386
but do you by chance
have two sets of the
exact same clothes on?

11:26.419 --> 11:28.021
Yes.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.490
But what does that
have to do with anything?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.192
:
Oh, nothing.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.261
Just asking.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.402
A few blocks away,
me and Greg were hoping

11:42.435 --> 11:44.037
nobody could see through us.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.172
This is it.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.207
"Ticket services,
check cashing,

11:47.240 --> 11:48.742
"bail bondsman,

11:48.776 --> 11:51.044
loans, piano lessons."

11:51.078 --> 11:53.180
Piano lessons?
Piano lessons?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.447
"Passport photos."

12:06.459 --> 12:08.461
Little dude
from across the street,

12:08.495 --> 12:09.529
can I help you?

12:09.562 --> 12:12.299
Wait, you work here?
Yeah. Why?

12:12.332 --> 12:14.367
Why didn't you say something
when we were at the barbershop?

12:14.401 --> 12:16.469
Look here, little dude
from across the street's friend

12:16.503 --> 12:19.006
from across town, I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:19.039 --> 12:22.342
Look, Jerome, we just
need some passport photos.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.410
You're not cops, are you?

12:23.443 --> 12:26.847
Why? Is it illegal for cops
to have passport photos?

12:26.880 --> 12:29.182
No. But if you knew passport
photos meant something else

12:29.216 --> 12:32.452
and you were trying to trick me,
I'd have to ask if you a cop,

12:32.485 --> 12:34.321
because legally,
you have to say yes,

12:34.354 --> 12:35.989
and then I wouldn't
give you one.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.524
Contrary to popular belief,

12:37.557 --> 12:40.160
you needed to be educated
if you wanted to drop out

12:40.193 --> 12:41.829
and become a criminal.
We're not cops.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.463
You could be undercover.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.032
Do we look like
21 Jump Street?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.867
Look, it could be
a sting operation.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.535
We're not cops.
We're not cops.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.072
Cool. Let me buzz my man.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.573
Money!

12:53.606 --> 12:56.309
I understand you boys
want to leave the country.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.444
Uncle Ryan?

12:57.477 --> 12:59.813
I hope he's not a cop.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.987
When I set out
to look for fake IDs

13:07.020 --> 13:08.989
I didn't expect to find
my real uncle.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.357
You sell fake IDs?

13:10.390 --> 13:11.391
What are you
talking about?

13:11.424 --> 13:12.826
You're the one
trying to buy it.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.261
Does my father know
you do this?

13:14.294 --> 13:15.428
No.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.297
Does your mom know
you're doing this?

13:17.330 --> 13:19.566
No. You're not gonna
tell her, are you?

13:19.599 --> 13:20.500
And ruin my good business?

13:20.533 --> 13:21.501
I don't think so.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.170
You're not
gonna tell?

13:23.203 --> 13:24.437
No, I'm no snitch.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.573
We just want to go
see the Fat Boys.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.075
Oh. I love those guys.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.444
* All you can eat...

13:38.118 --> 13:40.520
So, when can we get 'em?
And how much
is it gonna cost?

13:40.553 --> 13:41.721
Well, that depends.

13:41.754 --> 13:44.557
When it comes to delivery,
you have three separate options.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.960
You can get 'em fast and cheap,
but not good;

13:46.994 --> 13:49.562
you can get 'em
good and cheap,
but not fast;

13:49.596 --> 13:52.632
or you can get 'em fast
and good, but not cheap.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.169
Well, the concert's tomorrow,
so how much is the last option?

13:56.203 --> 13:57.504
25 bucks.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.239
Each.

14:01.574 --> 14:04.211
:
Well, it is the Fat Boys.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.979
Wait.

14:06.013 --> 14:09.349
You really want a fake ID
to go the Fat Boys concert?

14:09.382 --> 14:10.417
Yeah.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.086
You're not gonna try
to get liquor or cigarettes

14:13.120 --> 14:14.421
or go see X

14:14.454 --> 14:16.223
Not until you mentioned it.
No.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.525
You'll have 'em tomorrow.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.063
Drew's X-ray glasses
didn't work,

14:23.096 --> 14:25.899
so he had his eye on a refund.

14:25.933 --> 14:29.903
Uh, "ticket services,
check cashing..."

14:31.404 --> 14:33.373
Lemonade?

14:33.406 --> 14:35.542
Not "lemonade."
"Laminated."

14:35.575 --> 14:37.510
It means "covered in plastic."

14:37.544 --> 14:39.479
I want you to get
these laminated,

14:39.512 --> 14:41.381
so they look like
the real thing.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.250
When it's done,
take 'em to Chris.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.052
Cool.
All right?

14:46.219 --> 14:48.655
What's up, Drew?
Hey, what's up, Jerome?

14:48.688 --> 14:49.656
Hey.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.291
What are you doing here, man?

14:51.324 --> 14:52.960
I'm looking
for Vision Ray Specs, Inc.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.627
I bought a pair
of X-ray glasses,

14:54.661 --> 14:56.196
but the things don't even work.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.497
I'm getting
my money back.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.032
Ah, sorry about that.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.567
You're Vision Ray Specs, Inc?

15:00.600 --> 15:03.536
Yep. Look, I can get
you something else.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.605
Uh, whoopie cushion,
joy buzzers,

15:05.638 --> 15:07.374
sea monkeys, black gum.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.409
Nah, that's okay.
I just want my money.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.677
Drew couldn't see
through his hand,

15:10.710 --> 15:12.679
but he could see
through Ryan's BS.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.481
Here.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.349
I'll give you half.
What's this?

15:16.383 --> 15:18.551
That's 50 cents.
Glasses cost a dollar.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.687
I spent five dollars
on shipping and handling.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.389
That's six. You owe me three.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.394
Whoa, whoa,
give me my 50 cents back.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.630
That's what 50's girlfriend
said to Vivica Fox.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.632
Now that I had my fake ID,

15:32.665 --> 15:34.634
I was ready to have
some real fun.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.569
Okay, Chris, you know the rules.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.671
You go directly
to Greg's house,

15:38.705 --> 15:40.373
you stay at Greg's house,

15:40.407 --> 15:42.542
and tomorrow, you
come directly home.

15:42.575 --> 15:43.710
Right.

15:43.743 --> 15:44.577
TONYA:
And remember,

15:44.611 --> 15:46.413
if you do anything
you shouldn't do,

15:46.446 --> 15:48.315
it'll be like sticking a knife
in your mother's back.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.550
What she said.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.588
Hey, honey.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.624
You look nice.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.096
What's for dinner tonight?

16:03.130 --> 16:05.465
I don't know, baby.
Ask your daddy.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.467
I'm hanging out
with Vanessa tonight,

16:07.500 --> 16:10.337
since he doesn't
want to have a party.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.274
Daddy, Mommy told me
to ask you what's for dinner.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.609
Big bucket of fried crow.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.317
Dude, we are so in there.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.353
I hope so.
You got yours memorized?

16:26.386 --> 16:28.521
Yeah. Paul Stanley,
June 6, 1968.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.191
What about you?
Gene Simmons,
April 4, 1968.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.493
Whoa! IDs, please.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.164
Gene Simmons,

16:37.197 --> 16:40.533
April 4, 1968.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.103
Isn't that the day they
assassinated Dr. King?

16:43.136 --> 16:45.738
I didn't have nothing
to do with it.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.674
Mm-hmm. And,
Paul Stanley,

16:47.707 --> 16:50.810
your birthday is
June 6, 1968--

16:50.843 --> 16:53.380
the same day Robert Kennedy
was assassinated.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.482
And here you two
are together.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.684
What are the odds
of that happening?

16:57.717 --> 16:59.752
About the same
as you being dumb enough

16:59.786 --> 17:01.588
to believe any answer
we give you.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.423
It's crazy.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.624
It is, ain't it?

17:04.657 --> 17:06.226
Go ahead.
Have a good time.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.294
Ah, yeah.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.129
Hey, Paul, Gene...

17:09.162 --> 17:10.563
don't get shot.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.669
Of all the things
I did expect to see

17:16.703 --> 17:18.838
when I went into
an adult nightclub,

17:18.871 --> 17:21.274
there was one thing
I didn't expect:

17:21.308 --> 17:23.276
a bunch of kids.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.678
Hey, if it isn't
Bosco and Milk.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.115
Caruso?
You like the Fat Boys?

17:28.148 --> 17:29.749
I'm not Caruso, idiot.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.319
In here, I'm H. Rap Brown.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.254
You think I'd miss
the Human Beatbox?

17:34.287 --> 17:36.389
She's, like,
a hip-hop Bobby McFerrin.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.524
Who?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.659
Dude, like, half
our class is in here.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.261
Hey, you guys
want some drinks?

17:41.294 --> 17:42.562
James?

17:42.595 --> 17:45.565
Hey, man, I'm not James.
I'm Tom Cruise.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.833
What are you guys having?

17:46.866 --> 17:48.468
Uh, two iced teas.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.636
Need to see some ID.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.472
ANNOUNCER:
Brooklyn, give it up

17:52.505 --> 17:53.806
for Prince Markie Dee,

17:53.840 --> 17:55.808
Kool Rock-Ski and...

17:55.842 --> 17:59.479
Buffy the Human Beatbox!

17:59.512 --> 18:01.514
All right, everybody,
up against the wall!

18:01.548 --> 18:02.549
Show's over!

18:02.582 --> 18:04.851
You're not taking me!

18:08.188 --> 18:09.656
What's the problem?

18:09.689 --> 18:11.491
The problem is,
everybody in here is two.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.426
You got a major
fake ID problem.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.529
MANAGER:
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.897
Yeah, neither does
Larry Bird here.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.768
Let's get all these
fake IDs out! Now!

18:21.801 --> 18:23.870
Hey, Vito, you gonna let him
do me like this, man?

18:23.903 --> 18:24.704
Come on, man!

18:24.737 --> 18:26.706
Hey, man! You don't
know me like that.

18:26.739 --> 18:29.276
Come on. I'm from Brooklyn!

18:29.309 --> 18:31.578
Whatever happened
to Hall and Oates?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.880
Back at home, my plans
had gone up in smoke.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.883
But my father was about
to put me back in the mix.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.751
Hey, Ma.
Hi, baby!

18:38.785 --> 18:41.521
How was your night?
It was cool.
How was yours?

18:41.554 --> 18:42.889
Ask him.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.761
Chris, I need your help.

18:48.795 --> 18:52.265
Sure. What do you need?

18:52.299 --> 18:54.767
I've got something
I need to do.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.537
Look, I need you to take
your mother to lunch.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.472
Here's some money.
Here you go.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.873
Whoa, this is serious.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.443
I'll be back about 2:00.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.278
I don't know
what's more surprising:

19:05.312 --> 19:07.747
my mother giving my father
the cold shoulder,

19:07.780 --> 19:10.483
or my father giving me
cold cash.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.689
ALL:
Surprise!

19:16.723 --> 19:18.191
Happy birthday to me!

19:21.861 --> 19:23.830
Who are all these people?

19:23.863 --> 19:27.567
JULIUS:
The only people I could find
for the party.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.837
Oh, baby!

19:30.870 --> 19:32.472
Mwah! Ooh!

19:32.505 --> 19:35.308
Blow out the candles before
you set the house on fire.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.711
:
Yay!

19:40.347 --> 19:42.815
Oh, I'll get it.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.352
Ma'am, we confiscated

19:45.385 --> 19:48.221
an ID in a raid at
a nightclub last night

19:48.255 --> 19:50.590
that belongs to someone
who lives at this address.

19:50.623 --> 19:51.824
An ID?
Yes.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.693
It was being used
by kids who were there

19:53.726 --> 19:55.362
in a failed attempt
to see the Fat Boys.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.929
As a community service,

19:56.963 --> 19:58.898
I am returning it
to its rightful owner.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.600
Well, what's the name
on the ID?

20:00.633 --> 20:01.734
Gene Simmons.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.637
Because Ace Frehley
would've sounded ridiculous.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.878
Ah, yeah, that
Gene Simmons, yeah.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.946
I do recognize him.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.916
Come tomorrow, nobody
will be able to recognize him.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.785
Thank you.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.722
Gene...!

20:22.755 --> 20:25.458
* Everybody hates

20:25.492 --> 20:27.927
* Gene.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.952
