WEBVTT

00:02.260 --> 00:04.630
Let's do it. Do the
whole relationship thing.

00:04.750 --> 00:06.110
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:06.145 --> 00:07.470
Why are you still here, Paul?

00:07.505 --> 00:08.770
I want to see Lucy.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.680
You have been so
tough on me because

00:11.715 --> 00:12.905
that's what mothers do.

00:12.940 --> 00:14.380
Make sure that you grow up right.

00:16.219 --> 00:18.540
These notes are submitted by
your husband's psychiatrist.

00:18.575 --> 00:20.860
She indicates that your
husband may have been suicidal.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.730
Obviously, this woman is lying.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.170
- Sam...
- I think I'm in love with you.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.250
Maybe you could tell him
you were screwing his father.

00:28.285 --> 00:29.630
That should break the spell.

00:39.810 --> 00:42.290
If you keep waking
me up this early,

00:42.300 --> 00:43.595
I am moving back
into the guest house,

00:43.630 --> 00:45.710
and I swear, we're never
gonna finish "The Wire."

00:46.110 --> 00:48.230
I don't even know
how you could sleep

00:48.265 --> 00:50.315
over this--this--this
drip, drip, drip.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.940
Well, clearly, you are unaware
of how loudly you snore.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.830
That trip, drip, drip
is like a lullaby.

00:55.020 --> 00:57.190
This happens once every few months.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.990
Harry says it has something
to do with th--the thingy

01:00.025 --> 01:02.270
in the doohickey that
makes the water come out--

01:02.305 --> 01:04.140
I don't--I don't
know. If I can--

01:04.670 --> 01:06.650
If I can just tighten it.

01:06.685 --> 01:07.530
Be careful.

01:12.070 --> 01:13.940
Woman, calm down.
It is just a leak.

01:13.975 --> 01:15.160
It's not the end of the world.

01:15.210 --> 01:17.865
I'm sorry I'm not thrilled
that my house is falling apart.

01:17.900 --> 01:20.520
Are you kidding? I love that
your house is falling apart.

01:20.555 --> 01:22.200
It's much closer to
my childhood fantasy

01:22.210 --> 01:24.900
of us sharing a crappy
Manhattan apartment together.

01:24.980 --> 01:28.540
Two sisters living in N.Y.C.,
and we drink our dinner,

01:28.575 --> 01:30.265
stay out all night--
it'd be amazing.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.000
That would've been great
when I was 25 and single,

01:33.035 --> 01:35.430
but I'm 37 and pregnant,

01:35.660 --> 01:36.950
So, you know...

01:36.985 --> 01:38.240
Not so much fun.

01:49.830 --> 01:52.480
Everything is broken, and
I don't know how to fix it.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.700
Literally or metaphorically?

01:55.640 --> 01:57.270
Let's start with literally.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.400
Well, that's easy.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.530
You're psyching yourself out.

02:00.900 --> 02:02.695
Sav, you lived all by yourself

02:02.730 --> 02:05.750
in that teeny, tiny apartment
in Venice for seven years,

02:05.830 --> 02:07.090
And you were fine.

02:07.150 --> 02:09.350
Yeah, I was fine
until I married Harry,

02:09.800 --> 02:11.940
and then he didn't
let me do anything.

02:11.975 --> 02:14.080
I mean, I couldn't
even open the mail.

02:14.660 --> 02:15.295
Really?

02:15.330 --> 02:19.540
Yeah. Well, I forgot to
send in the D.W.P. bill,

02:19.575 --> 02:21.200
and it turned into this whole deal.

02:21.235 --> 02:22.520
So he's dealt with the mail

02:22.555 --> 02:24.335
and he fixes the leaks

02:24.370 --> 02:27.540
and he programs the
remote controls for the TVs

02:27.575 --> 02:29.475
and changes the water filters,

02:29.510 --> 02:32.070
- the light bulbs.
- Wow. And you let him do all of that?

02:32.105 --> 02:33.595
I didn't really have a choice.

02:33.630 --> 02:35.790
He was kind of old school that way.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.800
Kinda like Ricky Ricardo
with a different accent.

02:44.210 --> 02:46.010
It's not that big of a deal.

02:46.045 --> 02:47.775
No. No. I-I
know, but I just--

02:47.810 --> 02:50.380
I really can't picture you
giving up that much control.

02:50.415 --> 02:52.280
That must've been
really hard for you.

02:53.530 --> 02:54.570
It was.

02:57.490 --> 02:59.950
But you get used to things.

03:03.860 --> 03:04.650
See?

03:05.310 --> 03:06.200
You fixed it.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.800
You're fine.

03:12.730 --> 03:13.540
Just kidding.

03:18.830 --> 03:20.225
There are first graders whose moms

03:20.260 --> 03:22.000
don't walk them all the
way to the front door.

03:22.030 --> 03:23.490
Sorry to embarrass you.

03:23.590 --> 03:24.590
No, you're not.

03:24.770 --> 03:26.280
You're right. I'm not.

03:26.590 --> 03:29.140
Have a good day at school, kiddo.

03:29.175 --> 03:30.090
Mom.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.410
April Malloy.

03:40.450 --> 03:41.195
Cheryl.

03:41.230 --> 03:42.740
The P.T.A. still
needs a chairperson

03:42.750 --> 03:45.340
for the grandparents and
special friends day committee.

03:45.375 --> 03:47.670
It is so meaningful to the children

03:47.705 --> 03:49.290
and their elderly loved ones.

03:51.330 --> 03:53.290
Sorry. Cheryl, I have to go.

03:53.325 --> 03:54.100
Okay.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.210
Start the car and meet
me at the park now.

04:04.650 --> 04:05.630
Okay.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.525
You've reached Savannah Davis.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.180
I'm not available
to take your call,

04:10.215 --> 04:11.800
So leave a message after the beep.

04:12.990 --> 04:13.800
It's me again.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.475
I'm still staring at
the summons on my desk

04:16.510 --> 04:20.170
where your law firm is basically
accusing me of killing Tom.

04:20.540 --> 04:23.070
And you're seriously not
gonna answer my calls?

04:32.090 --> 04:32.865
Early lunch.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.710
Where are we going?

04:36.780 --> 04:39.270
I'll just... wait here.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.915
Have you lost your damn mind?

04:49.950 --> 04:51.555
I told you. I need to see Lucy.

04:51.590 --> 04:53.570
And I told you that
wasn't gonna happen.

04:54.340 --> 04:55.520
What if she saw you?

04:55.800 --> 04:58.000
Do you know what that would
do to her? Do you even care?

04:58.035 --> 05:00.160
- Of course I care.
- You obviously don't.

05:00.195 --> 05:02.090
Hey, I'm sorry. It
was a stupid idea.

05:02.125 --> 05:04.090
We're way past stupid.

05:04.480 --> 05:08.520
Listen to me. I refuse to let
you ruin that little girl's life

05:08.555 --> 05:10.240
any more than you already have.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.590
Lucy was destroyed when
she lost her father.

05:12.625 --> 05:13.145
I know.

05:13.180 --> 05:16.160
You don't know because you
weren't there for three years.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.510
Why do you suddenly need
to see her again now?

05:19.545 --> 05:21.430
I never stopped needing to see her.

05:24.470 --> 05:25.760
Now that I'm here...

05:27.740 --> 05:29.490
she's just so close.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.020
I'm so sorry, April.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.000
I screwed up
everything--

05:40.420 --> 05:43.180
my life, your life, Lucy's.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.380
Please.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.790
Please.

05:51.590 --> 05:53.320
I can't lose Lucy.

05:58.540 --> 06:00.330
You can't lose what you don't have.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.960
Go back to your family in Florida

06:03.995 --> 06:05.820
because you've got no family here.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.180
We need to talk.

06:16.215 --> 06:16.840
Karen.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.750
What are you doing here?

06:20.040 --> 06:22.270
Look, this is not a good time.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.900
I can't have this
conversation here.

06:23.935 --> 06:25.517
You won't call me back.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.065
I can't talk about it.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.705
Fine. Have you at
least told your bosses

06:29.740 --> 06:31.650
that Elizabeth Grey's
a lying son of a bitch?

06:31.685 --> 06:33.095
Yet another thing I cannot do.

06:33.130 --> 06:36.240
You know she is. This
whole case is ridiculous.

06:36.275 --> 06:38.142
Elizabeth is the
one who killed Tom,

06:38.177 --> 06:40.010
and now she's saying
I'm responsible?

06:40.045 --> 06:41.590
Why didn't you at least warn me?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.790
I took myself off the case.

06:43.890 --> 06:45.160
I haven't been getting
all the e-mails.

06:45.195 --> 06:46.430
Come on, Savi.

06:47.580 --> 06:50.730
Karen, I've already given
you too much information,

06:50.765 --> 06:53.080
and if I had any idea
that this investigation

06:53.115 --> 06:55.480
was going to become about you,

06:55.650 --> 06:57.320
I wouldn't have told you anything.

06:57.355 --> 06:58.990
That makes me feel so much better.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.260
Karen, I am really sorry,

07:01.650 --> 07:03.295
but my job is on the line.

07:03.330 --> 07:04.940
My life is on the line.

07:06.980 --> 07:08.300
You can't talk to me about it?

07:08.335 --> 07:09.670
That's fine. I get it.

07:10.340 --> 07:12.135
But I am done playing
nice with this woman.

07:12.170 --> 07:15.390
Make sure you tell her that I am
not going down without a fight.

07:16.330 --> 07:17.530
Do you need a lawyer?

07:20.090 --> 07:21.570
I can recommend someone.

07:22.740 --> 07:23.855
I think that would qualify

07:23.890 --> 07:25.870
as yet another
conflict of interest.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.150
Thanks anyway.

07:44.290 --> 07:45.370
Yes, Olivier?

07:46.040 --> 07:47.350
How did you know it was me?

07:48.360 --> 07:49.710
I could smell your Acqua Di Gio

07:49.745 --> 07:50.950
from two decades away.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.200
Two prospective
clients from New York

07:55.235 --> 07:56.665
are in town for the evening.

07:56.700 --> 07:59.650
I need to convince them that
Los Angeles does not, um,

08:00.110 --> 08:01.025
how do you
put it--

08:01.060 --> 08:03.460
suck--because the
restaurants close at midnight.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.095
Are they staying in Beverly Hills?

08:05.130 --> 08:06.895
- Yes.
- Well, the restaurants there close at 10:00,

08:06.930 --> 08:09.950
so I highly suggest that you
find them a hotel on the strip.

08:10.380 --> 08:12.165
Bonne idÃ©. Uh, there's more.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.580
This couple is, uh, cosmopolitan.

08:14.860 --> 08:17.000
They believe life is
a sensuous adventure.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.620
Well, then why are
they moving to L.A.?

08:19.655 --> 08:22.800
- The husband is a dip.
- A dip?

08:22.835 --> 08:24.422
No, no, no. Um, a deep.

08:24.457 --> 08:25.975
- A D.P.?
- Oui. Sa. Ca.

08:26.010 --> 08:27.430
It means director of photography.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.850
He must be in the film business.

08:28.885 --> 08:29.535
In any case,

08:29.570 --> 08:32.470
I need an unforgettable
evening of entertainment,

08:32.505 --> 08:34.289
which is why I've come to you.

08:35.220 --> 08:39.400
So what I'm hearing is you
do find me entertaining.

08:40.539 --> 08:42.049
You'll accompany me tonight.

08:42.620 --> 08:43.880
Sorry. Can't.

08:44.010 --> 08:46.570
I'm already booked. I
snagged a reservation at Ink,

08:46.605 --> 08:48.277
and I'm taking my girlfriend out

08:48.312 --> 08:49.950
for our own unforgettable evening.

08:51.210 --> 08:52.170
Interesting.

08:53.130 --> 08:55.700
You and mademoiselle mala beads

08:55.735 --> 08:57.490
have become lovers?

08:57.970 --> 09:00.160
I've never heard it put like that,

09:00.195 --> 09:03.000
but oui, oui. We have.

09:34.110 --> 09:35.460
I'm sorry.

09:36.540 --> 09:39.590
Just a little 5-minute catnap.

09:40.300 --> 09:43.760
Uh, I mean a 35-minute catnap.

09:43.795 --> 09:44.890
Go home and rest.

09:45.190 --> 09:46.810
Oh, no, I can't. I'm
already a week behind

09:46.845 --> 09:48.635
on the Lieberman custody case.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.910
Work from home. Partners are
on retreat. They'll never know.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.350
You need to take
better care of yourself.

09:55.890 --> 09:56.700
Go home.

09:59.480 --> 10:00.130
Okay.

10:06.130 --> 10:07.290
Oh, shoot.

10:07.325 --> 10:08.450
So sorry.

10:09.640 --> 10:10.930
Here. Let me get that.

10:12.250 --> 10:15.620
Now just-- just take it
on the house. Okay. Sorry.

10:15.655 --> 10:16.620
Free coffee, huh?

10:17.680 --> 10:18.690
Count me in.

10:19.510 --> 10:22.380
Um, shouldn't you
be at--at work?

10:22.415 --> 10:23.305
I just want to check in.

10:23.340 --> 10:25.260
I saw you at the
drop-off this morning

10:25.470 --> 10:27.470
and wanted to say hi, but
you took off so quickly.

10:29.920 --> 10:30.940
Everything all right?

10:31.600 --> 10:33.200
Did Paul try to contact you again?

10:33.540 --> 10:34.500
Worse.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.820
Paul showed up at school today.

10:39.855 --> 10:40.725
He did what?

10:40.760 --> 10:43.460
He wanted to see Lucy
without Lucy seeing him.

10:43.800 --> 10:44.900
Is that what he said?

10:44.940 --> 10:47.100
Don't worry. I told him
it's not gonna happen

10:47.230 --> 10:49.780
- and that he needs to just go back to Florida.
- And?

10:51.330 --> 10:52.830
And he...

10:53.100 --> 10:54.700
broke down.

10:56.230 --> 10:57.630
I almost feel bad for him.

10:57.790 --> 10:58.920
That's what he wants.

11:00.190 --> 11:01.130
Did he say he was leaving?

11:01.165 --> 11:02.145
No, but
I'm--

11:02.180 --> 11:02.795
He's playing you, April.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.615
He's trying to worm his
way back into your life.

11:04.650 --> 11:07.410
- No, I-I really don't think
so. - This guy is a liar

11:07.620 --> 11:09.630
and a criminal, and you
need to go to the police.

11:09.665 --> 11:10.830
But I can't.

11:11.110 --> 11:13.335
I've thought about it,
but I just don't see

11:13.370 --> 11:15.670
how I can do this without
getting Lucy involved.

11:15.705 --> 11:16.770
Then involve her.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.150
Maybe it's time.

11:18.230 --> 11:20.440
That's the last resort,
and I am not there yet.

11:21.350 --> 11:22.485
Unless I am.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.760
I don't--I don't-- I
don't know. I don't know.

11:24.795 --> 11:25.910
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

11:26.120 --> 11:26.980
I'm sorry.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.745
Didn't mean to make you more upset.

11:28.780 --> 11:30.440
I've done everything
I can, but I just--

11:30.475 --> 11:32.300
I can't make him do anything.

11:32.910 --> 11:34.210
He's not listening to me.

11:35.430 --> 11:37.160
It's okay. It's okay.
We're gonna be okay.

11:38.390 --> 11:39.500
We're gonna figure it out.

11:43.360 --> 11:44.090
Entrez.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.590
Okay, do you remember those
choose your own adventure books?

11:51.870 --> 11:54.930
Right. They probably weren't
translated into French.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.005
- What are these?
- Three distinct itineraries.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.290
Our prospective couple can
choose just how adventurous

12:06.325 --> 12:08.100
they want their evening
in our fair city to be.

12:08.135 --> 12:09.685
I thought you had
plans for tonight.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.330
I do. But I've booked the
limo, made the reservations,

12:12.340 --> 12:13.785
and added your name to

12:13.820 --> 12:15.400
every velvet rope list in town.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.710
The planning's done.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.200
All you have to do is
close the deal with your...

12:19.590 --> 12:20.980
sparkling personality.

12:22.220 --> 12:23.880
Was that sarcasm?

12:24.880 --> 12:27.520
You know, just when I
think you'll never get me.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.690
Merci, Josslyn.

12:32.270 --> 12:34.290
I will miss your company tonight.

12:36.910 --> 12:37.710
Admit
it--

12:38.290 --> 12:40.200
You underestimated
me when we first met.

12:41.570 --> 12:42.550
Perhaps.

12:43.490 --> 12:45.310
But perhaps you are different now.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.740
Perhaps I am.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.010
Have fun.

13:14.030 --> 13:15.020
Everything all right?

13:18.000 --> 13:18.940
Uh, how are you?

13:21.470 --> 13:22.770
Is that why you called?

13:22.860 --> 13:25.360
N-no. The, um, shower's

13:25.780 --> 13:28.470
doing that-- that
plinking thing again.

13:28.550 --> 13:30.805
Well, did you tighten the handle?

13:30.840 --> 13:33.060
Uh, I did, yeah, but I don't know.

13:33.095 --> 13:34.440
I might not be strong enough.

13:36.060 --> 13:37.460
Are you asking me to fix it?

13:39.180 --> 13:40.940
If it's not an imposition.

13:44.380 --> 13:46.720
I can't today, Savi. I'm swamped.

13:47.800 --> 13:48.660
Okay.

13:48.670 --> 13:51.185
Uh, don't--don't worry
about it. It's fine.

13:51.220 --> 13:53.310
Try some bathroom
cork around the head.

13:53.345 --> 13:55.400
You can get it at
any hardware store.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.290
Great. Uh, I'll try that. Thanks.

13:59.010 --> 14:00.580
You're gonna have
to start figuring out

14:00.615 --> 14:02.150
how to do this stuff
on your own, Sav.

14:05.380 --> 14:06.380
Okay.

14:07.540 --> 14:08.470
You're right.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.460
I-I gotta go. Okay. Thanks.

14:22.510 --> 14:23.835
$80 for an estimate?

14:23.870 --> 14:25.800
But I already told you
what the problem was.

14:27.130 --> 14:28.775
$500?

14:28.810 --> 14:30.455
No, thank you. No, thank you.

14:30.490 --> 14:32.100
It's a leak, not a flood.

14:37.850 --> 14:39.020
I thought you could use this.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.560
Helped my sister with
exhaustion when she was pregnant.

14:42.110 --> 14:44.240
Gentle Buzz, no side effects.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.995
That's... really sweet.

14:47.030 --> 14:48.905
And I don't want
to seem ungrateful,

14:48.940 --> 14:51.800
but it's kind of a long
drive for a box of tea, huh?

14:51.835 --> 14:55.550
Well, also you forgot this.

14:56.890 --> 14:58.265
Not that you have to do any work,

14:58.300 --> 15:00.400
but you know, don't want those
Liebermans coming after you.

15:00.435 --> 15:02.420
Ugh. Does this tea help
with pregnancy brain?

15:02.455 --> 15:04.270
Because I officially have it.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.290
Well, we could make
a cup and find out.

15:08.020 --> 15:08.720
Okay.

15:14.170 --> 15:17.530
I'm gonna need you to do more
research on some of these law firms.

15:17.565 --> 15:19.750
My top two choices
aren't available,

15:20.070 --> 15:22.270
and I'm not comfortable
with the rest of these.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.930
Of course. When do you need it by?

15:24.270 --> 15:25.270
Yesterday.

15:25.700 --> 15:26.690
Dr. Kim?

15:27.700 --> 15:28.540
Sam.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.140
I'm sorry. I don't know
what to say right now.

15:45.130 --> 15:46.670
I wasn't expecting to see you.

15:46.705 --> 15:47.570
I know.

15:48.930 --> 15:51.390
I realize I still
owe you an explanation

15:51.500 --> 15:52.510
and I wanted to
call you, but--

15:52.545 --> 15:53.880
It's okay.

15:54.470 --> 15:56.230
I mean, it's not why I'm here.

15:57.580 --> 15:59.140
I know about the lawsuit.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.750
I can't discuss that with you.

16:00.785 --> 16:01.780
I know.

16:02.410 --> 16:04.260
I wanted to apologize.

16:04.570 --> 16:07.165
What my mom's doing to
you-- it's not right.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.760
I tried to talk her out
of it, but it's no use.

16:10.130 --> 16:11.680
She's out for blood.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.680
I thought I should warn you.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.520
Thank you. I gathered as much.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.680
So do you have a plan then?

16:20.210 --> 16:22.260
I don't even have a lawyer yet.

16:23.640 --> 16:24.690
Well, that's not good.

16:32.090 --> 16:33.590
I get it, by the way.

16:35.170 --> 16:35.950
What do you get?

16:35.985 --> 16:37.050
Everything.

16:37.150 --> 16:39.295
As soon as I found out
about you and my dad,

16:39.330 --> 16:41.440
a lot of things made
so much more sense.

16:44.020 --> 16:46.550
I hate that you found
out the way you did.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.860
I should've told you the
truth from the beginning.

16:49.895 --> 16:51.060
I'm glad you didn't.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.900
I never would've gotten
to know you if you told me.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.010
I wish things could've
turned out differently.

17:03.260 --> 17:04.190
Me, too.

17:19.349 --> 17:21.525
I was just thinking,

17:21.560 --> 17:23.770
I should pick Alex up
for a pregame cocktail.

17:26.250 --> 17:29.440
Oh no, that sucks.

17:30.270 --> 17:32.710
Do you need me to bring you
something? Soup? Ibuprofen?

17:34.560 --> 17:37.660
Okay. Well, text me
if you need anything.

17:38.780 --> 17:39.530
Okay.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.690
Olivia, it's Joss.

17:50.940 --> 17:52.530
Which adventure did they choose?

17:53.460 --> 17:54.520
I'll be right there.

18:11.870 --> 18:12.970
What?

18:14.910 --> 18:15.850
I'm sorry.

18:16.620 --> 18:17.275
Are you hungry?

18:17.310 --> 18:19.810
Uh, not as hungry as
you are, apparently,

18:19.845 --> 18:21.725
but yeah, I-I could eat.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.660
Okay. Let me see what I have.

18:23.695 --> 18:25.560
No. No. No. Sit. I got it.

18:33.060 --> 18:34.300
Savi.

18:42.090 --> 18:43.540
Um, what are you doing here?

18:44.960 --> 18:45.970
Joss, right?

18:46.320 --> 18:48.250
We haven't been properly
introduced. I'm Dominic Taylor.

18:48.285 --> 18:50.220
I know who you are. You
didn't answer my question.

18:50.740 --> 18:52.125
Well, your sister
fell asleep at work,

18:52.160 --> 18:53.960
so I just stopped by to
see if she needed anything.

18:53.995 --> 18:55.015
Savi doesn't need anything

18:55.050 --> 18:57.070
while she works things
out with her husband.

18:58.260 --> 18:59.285
All righty then.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.800
And just so you know, I
will never wear your T-shirt.

19:02.670 --> 19:03.505
I'm on team Harry.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.760
Oh, uh, well, good for you.

19:06.940 --> 19:08.865
You're not even gonna try

19:08.900 --> 19:10.710
to deny that you have
feelings for my sister.

19:11.030 --> 19:12.505
She's a good friend.

19:12.540 --> 19:14.650
Oh, please. I know what happened.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.420
You two are hardly platonic.

19:18.170 --> 19:19.350
You're probably right.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.800
Then let me be very clear. Okay?

19:22.960 --> 19:24.140
Savi loves Harry.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.290
You're not gonna win.

19:26.390 --> 19:27.420
We'll see.

19:28.040 --> 19:31.490
Life's a negotiation, and
I'm a damn good lawyer.

19:32.450 --> 19:33.650
I'm sure you are.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.590
Paul Malloy?

19:51.180 --> 19:52.610
April's friend.

19:52.870 --> 19:55.060
Boyfriend. Richard.

19:56.030 --> 19:56.940
Can I come in?

20:05.870 --> 20:07.900
I saw you two together at her shop.

20:08.570 --> 20:10.590
So Lucy's not the only
one you've been stalking?

20:12.320 --> 20:14.220
You a father, Richard?

20:14.630 --> 20:15.510
I am.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.490
Then you know better than to
talk about another man's child.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.700
April sic you on me or something?

20:22.735 --> 20:23.690
I came on my own,

20:24.060 --> 20:26.440
to get you to do what
she asked you to do--

20:27.010 --> 20:27.960
Leave.

20:30.590 --> 20:32.240
You're really into her, aren't you?

20:32.960 --> 20:34.410
I mean, I-I get it.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.760
April's an incredible woman.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.700
Which makes you god knows what
kind of fool to abandon her.

20:40.580 --> 20:42.040
I'm still her husband.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.090
You're just the guy keeping
my side of the bed warm, man.

20:47.380 --> 20:51.230
Stay away from April
and stay away from Lucy.

20:54.030 --> 20:55.060
Or what?

20:55.850 --> 20:57.680
Or April might not
go to the police,

20:58.470 --> 20:59.540
but I will.

21:05.060 --> 21:05.825
For your bus ticket home.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.575
I don't need your charity, man.

21:07.610 --> 21:10.400
Really? Cause I've heard
you had trouble with money

21:10.435 --> 21:11.740
the last couple of years.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.060
Dr. Kim?

21:34.340 --> 21:35.630
I'm Natalie Wade.

21:36.000 --> 21:36.695
I'm sorry.

21:36.730 --> 21:39.410
Uh, my assistant
must've made a mistake.

21:40.810 --> 21:42.960
I don't see a late
appointment on my schedule.

21:42.995 --> 21:45.790
I'm not a patient.
I'm your new attorney.

21:50.090 --> 21:51.190
Is that all you want?

21:51.330 --> 21:52.520
It's all you have.

21:55.430 --> 21:58.440
Sorry. I forgot to do food shopping

21:58.860 --> 22:00.760
for, like, the last six years.

22:01.990 --> 22:03.220
That's right.
He's a--

22:03.900 --> 22:04.820
He's a chef.

22:05.170 --> 22:06.000
Yep.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.990
Yeah. Well, yeah, I'm-- I'm
not that hungry. It's okay.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.320
No, it's not okay.

22:12.700 --> 22:15.720
I have no food in the house,
my plumbing doesn't work,

22:15.755 --> 22:18.122
- I'm sleeping on the job.
- Napping.

22:18.157 --> 22:20.490
It's okay to be a
disaster by myself,

22:20.630 --> 22:24.360
but how can you bring
a little human being

22:24.395 --> 22:25.900
into this crap storm?

22:25.910 --> 22:27.760
I mean, mothers are
supposed to have it together,

22:27.795 --> 22:29.000
You know? I mean...

22:29.670 --> 22:31.150
I'm sure the baby's
gonna want to eat

22:31.185 --> 22:32.910
something other than mustard.

22:32.920 --> 22:36.690
They don't need condiments until
they're at least 6 weeks old.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.200
Okay. We need a break.

22:44.810 --> 22:46.330
Come on. Let's go.

22:51.950 --> 22:53.670
Maybe it's not such a good idea.

22:59.770 --> 23:00.310
I'll drive.

23:00.345 --> 23:01.180
Okay.

23:01.700 --> 23:03.850
Okay. Where do you wanna start?

23:04.100 --> 23:06.310
How about we start
with who sent you here.

23:07.930 --> 23:09.540
You have friends in high places.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.410
Let's leave it at that.

23:11.660 --> 23:13.815
I spoke with Huxley Insurance.

23:13.850 --> 23:16.390
They uncovered two pharmacy
prescriptions for morphine

23:16.425 --> 23:17.560
that came from you,

23:17.950 --> 23:20.480
which is weird, since
you're not an oncologist.

23:20.515 --> 23:22.460
- I can explain that.
- You might need to.

23:23.260 --> 23:25.555
More pressing is that I
believe her attorneys are

23:25.590 --> 23:28.210
gonna suggest that you not
only prescribed the morphine,

23:28.510 --> 23:30.780
but you also administered
the fatal dose

23:30.790 --> 23:32.450
the night that Thomas died.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.180
They're gonna say you did it.

23:35.215 --> 23:37.020
What? But I didn't.

23:37.055 --> 23:37.825
I believe you.

23:37.860 --> 23:39.805
No, Miss Wade, you
have to understand.

23:39.840 --> 23:42.300
Elizabeth has a
vendetta against me.

23:42.335 --> 23:44.177
I believe you. This is a civil suit

23:44.212 --> 23:46.020
that would only win the income lost

23:46.055 --> 23:48.000
due to Thomas' untimely death.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.840
Since the doctors only
gave him weeks to live,

23:49.875 --> 23:51.390
it wouldn't amount to much.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.990
So she's not after the money.

23:55.290 --> 23:56.070
No.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.180
She wants to drag your
reputation through the mud.

24:00.980 --> 24:02.670
She wants to ruin you, Karen.

24:06.340 --> 24:07.500
Where do we start?

24:08.550 --> 24:10.450
We start with one
important question--

24:11.100 --> 24:13.640
do you remember where you were
the night Thomas passed away?

24:14.270 --> 24:15.860
I remember it clearly.

24:16.050 --> 24:17.510
I was at home alone.

24:17.660 --> 24:19.270
So you don't recall?

24:19.620 --> 24:20.940
No, I just said
that I was--

24:20.975 --> 24:22.190
That you don't recall.

24:22.810 --> 24:24.490
Of course, I'd
prefer it if you knew

24:24.525 --> 24:26.170
who it was that you were with.

24:26.750 --> 24:29.990
But if you don't, it's simply
okay to say you don't remember.

24:35.470 --> 24:38.470
You have an active social
life, a lot of friends.

24:40.430 --> 24:42.260
Are you sure you
weren't with one of them?

24:42.440 --> 24:43.280
No.

24:43.980 --> 24:45.230
I won't do that.

24:46.300 --> 24:47.500
Think about it.

24:50.150 --> 24:51.730
So what do you think of L.A.?

24:51.765 --> 24:54.030
Oh, it's just so bright.

24:54.040 --> 24:57.920
I never see so many people
wearing non-ironic pink fluorescent

24:57.955 --> 24:59.380
as I drive through L.A.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.700
You mean slog through.

25:00.710 --> 25:03.765
Traffic at 2:00 A.M.?
How do you put up with it?

25:03.800 --> 25:07.440
Oh, I take shortcuts through
the canyon in my convertible,

25:07.475 --> 25:10.090
but I drive with the
top down all year long.

25:10.530 --> 25:13.000
Try that during east
coast winter, huh?

25:13.470 --> 25:15.310
You do have one
thing going for you.

25:15.640 --> 25:19.490
Your struggling actresses are
far more attractive than ours.

25:21.150 --> 25:24.660
Anyway, wait until you taste
these martinis. They are to die.

25:25.260 --> 25:26.595
Dinner was lovely

25:26.630 --> 25:29.285
and, uh, the fancy
martinis are tasty,

25:29.320 --> 25:33.150
but what exactly is so
kinky about this itinerary?

25:35.280 --> 25:37.060
Five, four,

25:37.230 --> 25:39.050
three, two...

25:45.010 --> 25:46.660
The cabaret may have
been created in Paris,

25:46.695 --> 25:48.590
but it was perfected in Hollywood.

26:18.480 --> 26:19.400
Told you.

26:33.480 --> 26:34.940
Richard, oh, my God.

26:36.670 --> 26:37.875
What happened?

26:37.910 --> 26:40.340
I got in a fight. It's
not as bad as it looks.

26:40.490 --> 26:42.950
Wh-- oh,
you're bleeding.

26:42.985 --> 26:43.780
Really?

26:43.940 --> 26:44.780
Still?

26:45.850 --> 26:47.290
What kind of fight?

26:47.770 --> 26:49.635
Who did this? You
should call the police.

26:49.670 --> 26:51.500
Yeah, I suggested
that, but you said no.

26:51.990 --> 26:52.790
What?

26:55.460 --> 26:57.710
Oh, my God. Please
tell me you didn't.

26:57.745 --> 26:59.240
I just wanted to talk to him.

27:00.670 --> 27:03.215
You went to see
Paul? Are you insane?

27:03.250 --> 27:05.360
For the record, I didn't
throw the first punch.

27:06.090 --> 27:07.410
Why would you do that?

27:07.420 --> 27:08.795
You said he wasn't
listening to you.

27:08.830 --> 27:10.170
So you thought he'd listen to you?

27:10.205 --> 27:11.515
I was trying to help.

27:11.550 --> 27:14.750
I didn't want your help.
I didn't ask for your help.

27:14.785 --> 27:15.770
Now you just went

27:15.780 --> 27:18.850
and made it a million times
worse by going all caveman.

27:18.885 --> 27:20.152
This is my situation to deal with.

27:20.187 --> 27:21.385
I thought the point
of our situation

27:21.420 --> 27:22.880
was that we wouldn't have
to deal with things alone.

27:22.890 --> 27:23.765
Okay, you crossed the line,

27:23.800 --> 27:24.640
and if you
can't see that--

27:24.675 --> 27:25.765
- Fine.
- Richard

27:25.800 --> 27:28.200
No. No. You can't ask me to
be your shoulder to cry on

27:28.235 --> 27:30.600
when you're upset and then
get pissed when I try to help.

27:30.635 --> 27:32.310
Either I'm involved or I'm not.

27:32.960 --> 27:34.430
So what do you want?

27:38.450 --> 27:39.230
Yeah.

27:39.600 --> 27:40.670
That's what I thought.

27:52.270 --> 27:54.465
I can't remember the last time

27:54.500 --> 27:56.660
I was in jeans, at a mall,

27:56.695 --> 27:57.570
on a weekday.

27:58.370 --> 27:59.620
Feels pretty good, right?

28:00.180 --> 28:02.420
Yeah, I also haven't
been to the happy hour,

28:02.900 --> 28:04.395
or a movie...

28:04.430 --> 28:05.775
or eaten processed food.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.455
Okay. So you're
missing something there,

28:07.490 --> 28:10.150
'cause as far as I'm concerned,
cheese just doesn't taste right

28:10.160 --> 28:12.530
unless it's nuclear orange.

28:14.860 --> 28:15.730
So, um...

28:17.160 --> 28:18.490
how far along are you now?

28:19.550 --> 28:21.120
Almost nine weeks.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.400
Getting excited?

28:22.630 --> 28:26.290
Mm, I think I'm more
nervous than excited.

28:26.470 --> 28:28.550
You? Nervous? I don't believe it.

28:28.585 --> 28:29.570
Well, believe it.

28:30.190 --> 28:31.020
Which part?

28:32.310 --> 28:35.125
Well, it's just--every
time I try to figure out

28:35.160 --> 28:37.940
what it's gonna be like
or--or--or look like,

28:37.975 --> 28:39.412
I-I just can't see it, you know,

28:39.447 --> 28:41.403
and how am I ever gonna have time

28:41.438 --> 28:43.360
to take my kid to a playground?

28:43.950 --> 28:45.360
You know, I haven't even had time

28:45.395 --> 28:46.770
to buy a stroller or a crib yet.

28:46.780 --> 28:48.405
Whoa. You haven't
gotten a crib yet?

28:48.440 --> 28:50.030
Uh, forget about it.
You can't do this.

28:50.065 --> 28:51.375
I'm serious.

28:51.410 --> 28:53.860
Okay, look, my mom
worked full-time.

28:53.895 --> 28:55.847
Somehow I still
made it to the park.

28:55.882 --> 28:57.800
You know it just--
it just happens.

28:57.835 --> 28:59.280
No, it doesn't just happen.

28:59.290 --> 29:02.025
No, you're right. My
mom made it happen.

29:02.060 --> 29:04.310
She got food on the table,
she got clothes on my back,

29:04.345 --> 29:05.610
and for my 4th birthday,

29:05.790 --> 29:08.410
she got me the coolest
little green bike. It was--

29:09.290 --> 29:11.340
I was big on green.

29:11.380 --> 29:12.950
And she was all by herself?

29:13.040 --> 29:15.160
Mm-hmm. Single mom.

29:17.700 --> 29:20.140
I just never imagined
that that would be me.

29:21.170 --> 29:23.710
You know, none of this
is happening the way...

29:24.600 --> 29:25.730
I pictured it.

29:25.930 --> 29:26.710
So?

29:27.620 --> 29:28.950
Just 'cause it's not
how you imagined it

29:28.985 --> 29:30.340
doesn't mean it can't work.

29:30.750 --> 29:32.850
You just have to let
go of your expectations.

29:33.050 --> 29:35.070
Be happy about life's
little surprises.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.630
You know, like, uh...

29:36.800 --> 29:39.120
like enjoying a lemonade slushie

29:39.180 --> 29:40.860
on a Friday night in Glendale.

29:45.260 --> 29:46.540
You're gonna be fine, Savannah.

29:46.575 --> 29:48.080
And that baby
in there--

29:48.860 --> 29:50.040
It's gonna be amazing.

29:52.170 --> 29:54.020
You mean if it's yours, right?

29:54.630 --> 29:55.620
No.

29:56.850 --> 29:58.010
Because it's yours.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.320
I've looked at this from every
angle. The numbers don't add up.

30:08.330 --> 30:09.865
If we don't
do something--

30:09.900 --> 30:12.530
start lunch service,
cut back on staff--

30:13.100 --> 30:14.570
Savannah's is done.

30:16.540 --> 30:17.670
What about Savi?

30:18.710 --> 30:20.090
I'm not talking about your wife.

30:20.125 --> 30:21.470
I'm talking about the restaurant.

30:21.660 --> 30:22.345
It's game over

30:22.380 --> 30:24.200
if we don't make
some serious changes.

30:24.750 --> 30:25.670
Right-o.

30:27.030 --> 30:29.500
You don't even know the
rules to baseball, Harry.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.550
Have you listened anything I said?

30:31.585 --> 30:33.370
Um, yeah. Um...

30:33.900 --> 30:36.140
More customers, more revenue.

30:37.950 --> 30:39.770
It's more than that.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.195
Look, I took you out tonight

30:43.230 --> 30:44.875
so I could have
your full attention.

30:44.910 --> 30:48.740
Jeff, doom and gloom
is your thing, mate.

30:48.870 --> 30:50.280
And we always end up in the clear.

30:50.290 --> 30:52.100
Don't we? Now relax
and have a beer.

31:04.440 --> 31:05.530
Be my wingman?

31:08.420 --> 31:09.600
No, mate.

31:21.650 --> 31:23.500
Hey, Savi. It's me.

31:24.510 --> 31:26.510
I just wanted to say
thanks for your help

31:26.545 --> 31:28.830
and I'm sorry about this morning.

31:30.940 --> 31:32.270
I'll call you tomorrow.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.420
You are not enjoying yourself.

31:59.455 --> 32:01.060
Oh. Sure I am.

32:06.610 --> 32:08.090
You don't have to lie to me

32:08.125 --> 32:09.570
because I'm your boss, Josslyn.

32:11.550 --> 32:13.240
You have done
outstanding work tonight.

32:13.275 --> 32:14.660
It is all that matters.

32:15.820 --> 32:17.515
I've been here one time too many.

32:17.550 --> 32:19.210
The effect starts to wear off.

32:20.990 --> 32:23.380
You have been, um, overexposed.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.880
That's the understatement
of the year.

32:32.290 --> 32:34.080
Honestly, I'd rather
be with Alex right now.

32:34.115 --> 32:35.250
I feel bad. I haven't
even checked in

32:35.285 --> 32:36.600
to see how she's feeling.

32:36.980 --> 32:40.030
Do you mind if I just slip
out, make a call really quick?

32:40.065 --> 32:41.380
No. No. Not at all.

32:43.820 --> 32:45.790
You wear commitment well, Josslyn.

32:57.830 --> 32:59.095
Uh, you want these
anywhere in particular?

32:59.130 --> 33:00.360
Uh, you can just put
'em right there for now.

33:00.395 --> 33:01.340
Okay.

33:12.030 --> 33:13.170
Fixed your shower.

33:15.950 --> 33:17.010
Already, huh?

33:27.150 --> 33:28.370
Knock yourself out.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.540
No, Harry,
uh, j--

33:43.000 --> 33:45.940
I have the worst timing in history.

33:45.975 --> 33:46.625
You okay?

33:46.660 --> 33:48.920
He told me to fix it myself.

33:48.980 --> 33:50.225
He wasn't supposed to be here.

33:50.260 --> 33:52.160
Once he's cooled down, you
can tell him what happened.

33:52.195 --> 33:53.530
No, he won't believe me.

33:54.530 --> 33:57.130
Well, you want me to stay?

33:57.620 --> 33:58.340
No.

33:59.180 --> 34:01.970
I'm sorry. I'm--I'm
not mad at you.

34:02.005 --> 34:02.980
I-I get it.

34:04.340 --> 34:05.270
I get it.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.790
They have requested a tour
of properties tomorrow.

34:23.824 --> 34:24.915
Afternoon, of course.

34:24.949 --> 34:26.920
They look to be
having a long night.

34:26.955 --> 34:28.429
Hey. I'm glad I could help.

34:29.380 --> 34:32.199
Good. Because you'll be
showing them around town.

34:33.800 --> 34:35.710
They are officially your clients.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.949
Et voila. Here is my car.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.610
Bonsoir, madame.

34:42.590 --> 34:45.040
Olivier, you needed a car in L.A.,

34:45.074 --> 34:47.590
and you chose a Delorean?

34:48.850 --> 34:50.360
I love "Back to the future."

34:53.429 --> 34:54.250
What?

34:54.570 --> 34:56.570
Oh, my god. Are you
serious right now?

34:56.605 --> 34:58.570
Michael J. Fox--
he's a delight, no?

34:58.750 --> 35:02.100
Oh, Olivier, I gotta
say, never a dull moment.

35:03.110 --> 35:04.605
It's really cool.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.160
It looks just like
the one in the movie.

35:06.195 --> 35:07.700
That was the point.

35:08.070 --> 35:09.510
But does it take you back in time?

35:10.630 --> 35:11.840
Care to find out?

35:12.930 --> 35:13.900
Yeah?

35:17.950 --> 35:20.180
Oh, my god.

35:31.890 --> 35:34.550
Can I come in?

35:35.030 --> 35:35.800
Yeah.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.670
You want to see Lucy.

35:50.830 --> 35:53.460
This is all you get.

35:54.760 --> 35:56.160
When I'm done, you're done.

35:58.890 --> 35:59.560
Okay.

36:11.860 --> 36:12.820
Her, um...

36:14.290 --> 36:15.640
7th birthday,

36:15.750 --> 36:17.325
She fell and skinned her knee

36:17.360 --> 36:18.865
playing "Red light, green light,"

36:18.900 --> 36:22.280
So I let her have
two slices of cake.

36:25.530 --> 36:27.750
The second grade
class trip to Big Bear.

36:28.570 --> 36:30.780
It was the first time
she'd ever seen snow.

36:30.950 --> 36:32.640
Couldn't get her off that sled.

36:34.350 --> 36:35.880
Christmas two years ago,

36:38.210 --> 36:40.190
she knew Santa wasn't real,

36:40.225 --> 36:42.170
but she played along for me.

36:47.490 --> 36:49.110
You still put out my stocking?

36:49.460 --> 36:50.870
And your Easter basket.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.780
And we bake you a red
velvet cake on your birthday.

37:00.380 --> 37:04.290
I tell Lucy you're with
her everywhere she goes.

37:09.830 --> 37:10.740
Thank you.

37:29.080 --> 37:29.745
Sam, what
are you--

37:29.780 --> 37:32.690
I just want to check in and
see how it went with Natalie.

37:33.630 --> 37:34.875
You sent her to me?

37:34.910 --> 37:37.470
Uh, I thought she
would've told you.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.000
No. I
thought--

37:40.910 --> 37:41.940
Never mind.

37:43.470 --> 37:45.690
Thank you for doing
that. She's terrific.

37:45.850 --> 37:49.270
Yeah. M-my dad hated going
up against her in court,

37:49.305 --> 37:52.080
so I figured she had
to be pretty good.

37:53.670 --> 37:55.710
Why didn't you tell me
you were sending her over?

37:55.745 --> 37:57.630
If I did, you would've
refused my help.

37:57.740 --> 38:00.250
You're so used to being
there for other people.

38:00.610 --> 38:02.620
You're not good at
asking for what you need.

38:07.320 --> 38:08.460
Would you like to come in?

38:14.750 --> 38:16.470
So does she think you have a case?

38:18.630 --> 38:19.550
I don't know.

38:20.350 --> 38:21.640
It's complicated.

38:22.580 --> 38:25.290
I feel strange discussing
this with you, Sam.

38:26.670 --> 38:27.430
Why?

38:27.810 --> 38:30.390
I'm the only other person
who knows my mom is lying.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.740
Yes, and that's the problem.

38:33.570 --> 38:34.440
What do you mean?

38:36.000 --> 38:37.530
I was alone that night,

38:38.140 --> 38:39.820
the night your father died,

38:41.510 --> 38:43.860
which is making things difficult.

38:43.895 --> 38:45.210
You need an alibi.

38:48.850 --> 38:50.500
I'll figure something out.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.290
Use me.

38:53.290 --> 38:53.985
No, Sam.

38:54.020 --> 38:55.880
Why not? You could say...

38:56.620 --> 38:58.550
I was upset about my father dying.

38:58.585 --> 39:00.140
I wanted to talk to someone.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.120
It'd be easy.

39:02.420 --> 39:04.640
I could never ask you to
lie for me like that, Sam.

39:04.675 --> 39:07.260
You didn't ask. I offered.

39:15.990 --> 39:17.330
How did I get here?

39:19.630 --> 39:21.420
I can't believe this is happening.

39:22.470 --> 39:23.950
It's gonna be okay.

39:27.810 --> 39:29.210
I'm so sorry.

39:29.700 --> 39:30.650
Don't be.

39:31.980 --> 39:33.400
Just let me help you.

39:33.410 --> 39:35.400
I-I want to help you.

39:40.340 --> 39:42.190
I'd do anything for you, Karen.

41:23.710 --> 41:25.600
Thank you.

41:26.910 --> 41:29.940
Perhaps this may
continue over a nightcap?

41:36.540 --> 41:38.880
Non. Merci.
