00:02.297 --> 00:04.937
Arthur, did you see your sign?

00:04.962 --> 00:07.132
You're kidding me. They got me again?

00:07.157 --> 00:08.112
Got what?

00:08.137 --> 00:10.792
Oh, every spring, those senior girls

00:10.817 --> 00:14.417
from Blessed Heart, they mess
with my Superior Donuts sign.

00:14.526 --> 00:16.292
It's a classic prank.

00:16.294 --> 00:18.354
They unplug some letters
so it says "Super Nuts."

00:20.899 --> 00:23.733
"Super nuts" can also mean huge balls.

00:25.437 --> 00:26.970
Hilarious!

00:26.972 --> 00:28.851
Actually, it's a tradition.

00:28.876 --> 00:31.515
When I was a senior at
Blessed Heart, I did it.

00:31.540 --> 00:36.046
And by "did it," I mean started it.

00:36.048 --> 00:38.408
That's cute. Couple
schoolgirls do it, it's a prank.

00:38.433 --> 00:39.837
I do it, it's a felony.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.345
Did you guys see the sign?

00:44.370 --> 00:46.831
I know it's wrong, but I'm a
sucker for a good ball joke.

00:49.027 --> 00:51.327
Why do they always hit my shop, huh?

00:51.329 --> 00:54.397
"Buttons and Stuff" right
down the street, huh?

00:54.399 --> 00:56.259
You got it? Butt stuff.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.735
Every year he gets so upset.

01:01.790 --> 01:02.970
It's a harmless prank,

01:03.002 --> 01:04.367
like the time I passed out,

01:04.370 --> 01:06.370
and my brother wrote
"loser" on my forehead

01:06.372 --> 01:07.805
in permanent marker.

01:07.807 --> 01:09.440
I had just lost my job,

01:09.442 --> 01:11.855
so it really did a
number on me emotionally.

01:12.812 --> 01:15.279
But at the end of the day it was funny.

01:15.281 --> 01:17.014
To him.

01:17.016 --> 01:19.717
I miss my pranking days.

01:19.719 --> 01:22.634
Yesterday you filled
my holster with pudding.

01:23.923 --> 01:27.958
Yeah. I miss yesterday.

01:29.375 --> 01:29.994
Oh, Arthur,

01:29.996 --> 01:31.696
please don't tell me
you're about to climb that.

01:31.698 --> 01:33.631
- Why not?
- Because you're 75.

01:33.633 --> 01:35.466
You're pretty much made
of eggshells and nose hair.

01:35.468 --> 01:37.435
Oh, come on, what are you talking about?

01:37.437 --> 01:39.070
I got this. Here, take a look.

01:41.641 --> 01:43.708
Want to hop on my back, smart guy, huh?

01:43.710 --> 01:44.709
I could do this all day.

01:44.711 --> 01:46.177
Please stop.

01:46.179 --> 01:47.378
Your knees sound like someone

01:47.380 --> 01:48.813
biting into a Kit Kat.

01:50.682 --> 01:53.050
Arthur, just let Franco fix the sign.

01:53.052 --> 01:55.986
Yeah, it's why you hired one of them.

01:56.755 --> 01:59.690
What? A helper.

01:59.692 --> 02:01.659
Okay, stop being proud
and give me the ladder.

02:01.661 --> 02:03.294
- All right, all right, fine.
- Okay.

02:03.296 --> 02:04.595
Just take 'em out of the plugs.

02:04.597 --> 02:05.909
- Unplug plugs.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

02:05.934 --> 02:06.948
You'll figure it out
when you get up there.

02:06.973 --> 02:07.735
Yes, yes.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.333
There's no shame in accepting help.

02:09.335 --> 02:11.869
It doesn't mean you're
old, just that you're wiser.

02:11.871 --> 02:14.705
Which is another word for old.

02:14.707 --> 02:17.341
No, you wouldn't believe
how many emergency calls

02:17.343 --> 02:18.809
start out with someone
getting on a ladder

02:18.811 --> 02:21.078
to put up their Christmas lights.

02:23.348 --> 02:25.082
Do you remember that guy?

02:25.084 --> 02:27.017
He grabbed a strand of lights

02:27.019 --> 02:30.020
and got electrocuted
before hanging himself.

02:30.022 --> 02:33.157
His family is Jewish now.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.727
Franco!

02:37.696 --> 02:39.397
What happened?

02:39.399 --> 02:40.731
- Are you all right?
- You all right?

02:40.733 --> 02:43.334
I think I twisted my ankle.

02:43.336 --> 02:44.635
Oh, my God!

02:44.637 --> 02:48.305
"Superior Nuts."

02:48.307 --> 02:49.340
Which could also mean

02:49.342 --> 02:52.042
the finest testicles.

02:53.545 --> 02:57.124
He's hurt. I'm healing with laughter.

03:07.826 --> 03:09.160
Oh, there he is.

03:09.162 --> 03:10.694
What'd they say about your ankle?

03:10.696 --> 03:13.230
Well, he said I should
ice it, wrap it up,

03:13.232 --> 03:15.475
and check out the sale on Easter candy.

03:16.002 --> 03:17.735
Your doctor sells candy?

03:17.737 --> 03:20.204
No, it was a security
guard at Walgreens.

03:20.206 --> 03:23.874
And he gave me this
from the lost and found.

03:23.876 --> 03:26.010
Well, I think it makes you
look very distinguished.

03:26.012 --> 03:28.847
Throw on a monocle, you'll
look just like Mr. Peanut.

03:30.149 --> 03:32.550
Oh, I'm sorry, is that racist?

03:32.552 --> 03:34.385
Why would that be racist?

03:34.410 --> 03:36.143
I don't know, it just felt wrong.

03:38.979 --> 03:42.059
Maya, is Mr. Peanut black?

03:42.061 --> 03:44.695
You asked me that yesterday,
and the answer is still

03:44.697 --> 03:46.864
stop asking me that.

03:46.866 --> 03:48.666
Franco, why don't you go see a doctor?

03:48.668 --> 03:50.367
Well, funny thing is,

03:50.369 --> 03:52.970
doctors would like you to
have money or insurance.

03:52.972 --> 03:54.138
And I got neither.

03:54.140 --> 03:55.739
Arthur, are you telling me

03:55.741 --> 03:57.641
you don't have a health
plan for your employees?

03:57.643 --> 03:59.877
Employee. It's very expensive

03:59.879 --> 04:01.779
for a small business to do that.

04:01.781 --> 04:03.447
I'd have to raise the
price of the donuts

04:03.449 --> 04:05.349
from 89 cents to a buck 20.

04:05.351 --> 04:07.685
Suck it up, Franco, you're on your own.

04:08.554 --> 04:10.187
Come on, man, I'm used to this.

04:10.189 --> 04:12.273
When you grow up broke, you
can't just run to the doctor

04:12.298 --> 04:13.557
every time you sneeze.

04:13.559 --> 04:15.606
You couldn't afford to go to the doctor?

04:15.631 --> 04:17.541
What did your therapist say?

04:19.130 --> 04:21.374
I'm just gonna sit down.

04:22.235 --> 04:24.134
I don't need a doctor, all right?

04:24.136 --> 04:25.536
I got my Grandma Cici.

04:25.538 --> 04:27.238
You know, she's the
queen of home remedies.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.406
You got a cold, she gives
you whiskey and lemon.

04:29.408 --> 04:31.041
All right, if you got an ear infection,

04:31.043 --> 04:33.043
she blows cigarette smoke in your ear.

04:33.045 --> 04:36.780
So, basically, you grew up in a casino.

04:36.782 --> 04:38.816
I feel terrible, you know?

04:38.818 --> 04:40.084
I-I wish I was in a position

04:40.086 --> 04:41.385
to offer you insurance.

04:41.387 --> 04:43.320
Yeah, it's tough not having insurance.

04:43.322 --> 04:45.322
I lost mine when they
shut down the factory.

04:45.324 --> 04:47.324
Took me three years to
pay off a kidney stone

04:47.326 --> 04:49.093
that was clogging up the old pistol.

04:52.178 --> 04:53.631
It's ridiculous. You know we're one

04:53.633 --> 04:55.065
of the only developed countries

04:55.067 --> 04:56.767
that doesn't offer
universal health care?

04:56.769 --> 04:59.550
Oh, boo-hoo.

05:00.907 --> 05:04.174
I'm playing the world's tiniest rababa.

05:06.011 --> 05:07.845
It is an Iraqi violin.

05:07.847 --> 05:09.647
Very sad. Very sad.

05:09.649 --> 05:12.850
You're saying you don't offer
your employees health care?

05:12.852 --> 05:15.853
American workers get
everything handed to them.

05:15.855 --> 05:19.256
Sick days, and time
off to have a baby. Ha!

05:19.258 --> 05:21.158
In Iraq, if you go into labor,

05:21.160 --> 05:23.037
you hold it in until lunch.

05:24.732 --> 05:28.552
And the baby finishes the
day out in the mailroom.

05:29.302 --> 05:30.601
Hey, wait a second, wait a second.

05:30.603 --> 05:31.902
I just realized,

05:31.904 --> 05:33.203
when I hired you,

05:33.205 --> 05:35.205
I had to get workman's comp insurance.

05:35.207 --> 05:37.241
You got hurt on the job,
so you should be covered.

05:37.243 --> 05:39.376
No, no, no, I don't want
this to cost you anything.

05:39.378 --> 05:40.911
No, no, no, no, it's not
gonna cost me anything.

05:40.913 --> 05:42.246
I already paid for it.

05:42.248 --> 05:44.366
Well, uh...

05:45.685 --> 05:47.151
since you already paid for it,

05:47.153 --> 05:48.786
I guess it does hurt so
bad that I want to die.

05:48.788 --> 05:50.187
Uh-huh.

05:50.189 --> 05:53.023
You know what my workman's comp is?

05:53.025 --> 05:54.224
Telling whoever's hurt

05:54.226 --> 05:55.693
that there are seven people in line

05:55.695 --> 05:58.228
that would do their
job for half the price.

05:58.230 --> 06:01.632
Fawz, you would have made a
great plantation owner, man.

06:01.634 --> 06:03.467
Thank you.

06:03.469 --> 06:05.202
Wait a minute.

06:05.204 --> 06:06.439
Thank you.

06:11.176 --> 06:13.110
Yes, Grandma, I drank the vinegar

06:13.112 --> 06:14.947
and put the pennies in my shoes.

06:16.282 --> 06:18.215
No, I'm not rubbing snake venom

06:18.217 --> 06:20.486
and volcanic ash on my foot.

06:21.487 --> 06:23.487
'Cause I don't own a snake, Grandma.

06:23.489 --> 06:25.456

06:26.034 --> 06:27.124
All right, Grandma. I got to go.

Oh.

08:24.021 --> 08:25.846
Well, I'm glad you
finally went to the doctor.

08:25.909 --> 08:27.775
Nah. I looked up some symptoms online.

08:27.777 --> 08:30.544
Tenderness, swelling and
whenever I put weight on it,

08:30.546 --> 08:32.547
there's a sound like...

08:36.518 --> 08:38.826
So, um, h-how did you get the cast?

08:38.851 --> 08:40.054
Oh, it's homemade.

08:40.056 --> 08:41.621
I used some things I
found in the kitchen.

08:41.624 --> 08:43.547

08:45.445 --> 08:47.061

08:47.063 --> 08:48.496
You have to go to a doctor.

08:48.498 --> 08:50.731
Randy, with the X-rays
and the extra fees,

08:50.733 --> 08:52.566
that's gonna cost me
about a couple grand.

08:52.568 --> 08:54.068
What about the free clinic?

08:54.070 --> 08:55.403
Well, I called them. When I told them

08:55.405 --> 08:57.605
I had a broken foot, they
gave me an appointment.

08:57.607 --> 08:59.440
In three months.

08:59.442 --> 09:01.342
I think it's very resourceful.

09:01.344 --> 09:03.177
Thank you, Maya. See?

09:03.179 --> 09:04.879
I made it out of
paper-mâché and newspapers.

09:04.881 --> 09:07.481
You want to sign it?

09:07.483 --> 09:09.417
Uh-oh.

09:09.419 --> 09:12.901
My horoscope says that I should
stay away from Capricorns today.

09:12.926 --> 09:14.433
Well, that's funny,
'cause I'm a Capri...

09:15.758 --> 09:17.858
- Ah, sorry.
- It's cool.

09:17.860 --> 09:18.993
It's cool. I'll just, uh...

09:18.995 --> 09:20.594
plug it up with some
dough in the kitchen.

09:20.596 --> 09:22.430
Whew!

09:22.432 --> 09:24.799
'Sup, James?

09:30.772 --> 09:32.573
He's got to go to a doctor.

09:32.575 --> 09:34.108
Take him to yours.

09:34.110 --> 09:36.577
I can't. He died eight years ago.

09:36.579 --> 09:38.546
W-Wait a minute. You
haven't seen a doctor

09:38.548 --> 09:39.780
in eight years?

09:39.782 --> 09:42.149
I don't need to. I outlived my doctor.

09:44.186 --> 09:46.153
I won.

09:47.356 --> 09:50.291
I'm just gonna have to find
the money and pay for it myself.

09:50.293 --> 09:52.126
Maybe you should let us help.

09:52.128 --> 09:54.161
Yeah, we could raise the
money and surprise him with it.

09:54.163 --> 09:55.329
That's a great idea.

09:55.331 --> 09:57.498
I do fund-raisers at
school all the time.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.733
We could have a bake sale.

09:58.735 --> 10:00.534
Maya, this is a donut shop.

10:00.536 --> 10:03.270
It's a seven-day-a-week bake sale.

10:03.272 --> 10:06.107
Right. I'll do a GoFundMe campaign.

10:06.109 --> 10:07.241
I can chip in.

10:07.243 --> 10:09.677
I just made 200 bucks
in our office pool.

10:09.679 --> 10:12.713
Every month, we guess how many John Does

10:12.715 --> 10:14.548
will be fished out of the lake.

10:14.550 --> 10:17.105
Six and a half, baby.

10:20.455 --> 10:21.756
Oh, ooh.

10:21.758 --> 10:24.859
I could put on a magic show.

10:24.861 --> 10:27.418
I did one for the Police
Foundation benefit.

10:27.443 --> 10:31.386
Yeah, he put on his cape and
all the women disappeared.

10:35.837 --> 10:38.472
Thank you, guys. Um, but
let's keep this between us.

10:38.474 --> 10:40.975
I mean, you know how Franco gets. Huh?

10:40.977 --> 10:43.310
- Hey, let me get in on this.
- No, that's all right, Tush.

10:43.312 --> 10:44.412
We know you've been strapped lately.

10:44.414 --> 10:46.013
Hardly. I've been invited

10:46.015 --> 10:48.416
to do a clinical trial
of antidepression drugs.

10:48.418 --> 10:49.950
They test them on humans

10:49.952 --> 10:53.080
because monkeys are too
stupid to sign the waiver.

10:54.724 --> 10:56.391
But not this guy.

11:01.296 --> 11:03.931
Maya, nice work on the can.

11:05.770 --> 11:08.469
Where'd you get such a
sad picture of Franco?

11:08.471 --> 11:11.839
I might've Photoshopped
some baby seal eyes on him.

11:11.841 --> 11:13.240
Ah.

11:13.242 --> 11:16.577
And put his head on
the body of Tiny Tim.

11:16.579 --> 11:19.013
Well, here is my contribution.

11:19.015 --> 11:21.182
Oh, Fawz, I'm impressed.

11:21.184 --> 11:22.883
Oh, it's just pocket change.

11:22.885 --> 11:25.286
From the pockets of the people
that drop off their clothes

11:25.288 --> 11:26.587
at my dry cleaners.

11:27.590 --> 11:30.459
Minus the quarters, of course.

11:31.060 --> 11:33.327
Hey, guys?

11:33.329 --> 11:35.463
Anybody there?

11:35.465 --> 11:36.931
Tush, what's wrong?

11:36.933 --> 11:38.799
Oh, turns out that drug's

11:38.801 --> 11:40.701
not quite ready for the marketplace.

11:40.703 --> 11:43.544
I'm experiencing some
temporary blindness.

11:43.569 --> 11:46.340
And nausea and enlarged breasts.

11:47.196 --> 11:50.277
Which sucks because I'm
too blind to check 'em out.

11:50.279 --> 11:53.414
But, for Franco, it's all worth it.

11:53.416 --> 11:55.349
Okay. Thanks, Tush.

11:55.351 --> 11:57.284
Oh, this is amazing.

11:57.286 --> 11:59.553
We have almost $800.

11:59.555 --> 12:01.322
I'm gonna match it
with yesterday's take.

12:01.324 --> 12:02.890
We had a good day.

12:02.892 --> 12:04.592
The president made a speech.

12:04.594 --> 12:06.416
There was a lot of stress-eating.

12:07.929 --> 12:09.363
We're almost at our goal.

12:09.365 --> 12:11.465
Let's keep passing the can around.

12:13.101 --> 12:15.469
Care to make a donation
for our injured friend?

12:15.471 --> 12:16.704
Sorry.

12:16.706 --> 12:18.339
Put ten dollars in that can,

12:18.341 --> 12:20.441
or I'll give you a $60 ticket.

12:20.443 --> 12:22.176
Your van's parked in the red.

12:22.178 --> 12:23.844
It's just a little bit in there.

12:23.846 --> 12:25.248
That's what my ex said.

12:26.849 --> 12:29.850
Nine months later, we had a kid.

12:33.089 --> 12:34.688
Sorry I'm late.

12:34.690 --> 12:38.425
My soup ladle got
caught in an escalator.

12:39.494 --> 12:42.363
Poor bastard. Make it $20.

12:43.285 --> 12:44.402
What was that?

12:44.427 --> 12:45.809
Well, you weren't supposed

12:45.834 --> 12:47.134
to find out about it yet, but, uh...

12:47.136 --> 12:49.336
Surprise!

12:50.405 --> 12:52.006
What is that?

12:52.008 --> 12:53.974
We took a collection.
There should be enough there

12:53.976 --> 12:55.409
to cover your medical costs.

12:55.411 --> 12:57.278
Everyone contributed, even Fawz.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.913
Yes, and because we are friends,

12:58.915 --> 13:00.971
you can pay me back whenever you want.

13:03.526 --> 13:05.553
He's not paying you back.

13:05.555 --> 13:09.223
Okay. Then you will owe me a favor.

13:09.225 --> 13:11.592
Forget it. I'm not taking your money.

13:11.594 --> 13:12.560
Why not?

13:12.562 --> 13:14.562
Because I'm not some damn charity case.

13:14.564 --> 13:16.230
This is embarrassing, man...

13:16.232 --> 13:18.346
You Photoshopped my
head on Oliver Twist.

13:20.869 --> 13:22.603
It's actually Tiny Tim.

13:22.605 --> 13:26.607
Who cares? Stop putting my
face on sad British boys!

13:26.609 --> 13:28.509
Oh, come on, kid. Stop being so proud.

13:28.511 --> 13:31.045
- We're just trying to help you.
- Well, don't!

13:31.047 --> 13:33.047
I already told you. I
didn't need your help.

13:33.049 --> 13:35.349
And you did it anyway. Well,
let me tell you something.

13:35.351 --> 13:37.518
I've been taking care
of myself since I was 16,

13:37.520 --> 13:39.587
and I've been doing just fine.

13:39.589 --> 13:42.723
Now if you'll excuse
me, I got to get to work.

13:45.728 --> 13:49.430
See you.

13:49.432 --> 13:52.566
Later.

13:52.568 --> 13:54.468
Almost there.

13:54.470 --> 13:56.403
Is he still storming out?

13:56.405 --> 13:58.389
Let me know when we can talk about him.

14:05.934 --> 14:06.879
Morning.

14:06.904 --> 14:08.543
Hey, Tush, you can see again.

14:08.739 --> 14:10.105
Yep. My eyes are fine.

14:10.107 --> 14:11.807
Having a few short-term memory problems,

14:11.809 --> 14:14.794
my eyes are fine.

14:17.396 --> 14:20.082
Just having a few
short-term memory problems.

14:21.051 --> 14:23.777
Thanks.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.516
Are you kidding? Where the
hell did you get that thing?

14:26.541 --> 14:28.566
Well, you know that hospital
supply store on Foster Avenue?

14:28.591 --> 14:30.125
Yeah. Yeah, there's
a junkyard next door,

14:30.127 --> 14:31.593
and somebody just threw this away.

14:31.595 --> 14:33.443
Oh, for God's sake!

14:33.468 --> 14:34.935
You can't do your job in that thing.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.304
Yes, I can. All right?

14:38.569 --> 14:40.836
And I wouldn't be here if
I didn't need the money.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.338
Now, who wants some coffee?

14:42.340 --> 14:44.445
I could use one, young man.

14:44.470 --> 14:47.109
All right. Coming right
up. What's up, man?

14:48.078 --> 14:50.913
All right. Yeah...

14:50.915 --> 14:52.948
Here we go.

14:53.377 --> 14:54.717
Cup of coffee.

14:55.346 --> 14:56.585
Cup of joe.

14:57.190 --> 14:58.393
All right.

15:02.058 --> 15:03.992
Oh, I am so sorry, Tush.

15:03.994 --> 15:05.694
- Tush, you all right?
- Yep.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.350
I don't feel a thing.

15:08.842 --> 15:09.698
Here's a list of side effects.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.463
Would you call this numbness

15:11.488 --> 15:13.496
or "loss of feeling in extremities"?

15:14.238 --> 15:15.831
Hey, would you give me that thing?

15:15.856 --> 15:17.072
I mean, you, you're gonna kill somebody.

15:17.074 --> 15:18.507
I'm sorry, man.

15:19.876 --> 15:22.111
Hi, I'll take a pound
of pistachios, please.

15:22.113 --> 15:25.747
What the hell are you talking...
Oh, geez. "Superior Nuts."

15:25.772 --> 15:26.882
No, this is a donut shop, I'm sorry.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.384
So no pistachios?

15:28.386 --> 15:30.974
Uh, here. Take a Crunchy Munchie,

15:30.999 --> 15:32.193
you can lick the nuts off 'em.

15:34.357 --> 15:36.792
I can't believe I forgot
to take care of that sign.

15:37.481 --> 15:38.261
What are you doing?

15:38.286 --> 15:39.832
Yo, Arthur, we talked about this, man.

15:39.857 --> 15:41.339
You are too old to be
climbing that ladder.

15:41.364 --> 15:43.230
Yeah, let one of us do it.

15:43.351 --> 15:46.719
I'd volunteer, but I might
be suffering from dizziness

15:46.721 --> 15:49.008
or "irregular periods."

15:50.524 --> 15:52.257
I don't need help. I've
been climbing this ladder

15:52.259 --> 15:54.382
for 40 years. I'm fine.

15:55.524 --> 15:58.430
- Yo! What's wrong?
- It's my back. I can't move.

15:58.432 --> 16:00.032
- Okay, well, come here.
- I got you. No, I can't move.

16:00.034 --> 16:01.734
- I got you, come here.
- No. Oh, okay.

16:01.736 --> 16:03.569
- All right. It's okay.
- Ow, ow, ow.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.204
- It's okay. It's all right.
- Ow, ow.

16:05.206 --> 16:06.405
Ow, my foot!

16:06.407 --> 16:07.439
Ow, my back!

16:07.441 --> 16:09.375
Ow!

16:09.377 --> 16:10.399
Ow!

16:10.424 --> 16:11.524
Hot coffee!

16:13.813 --> 16:16.011
I guess that numbness was temporary!

16:16.751 --> 16:18.283
Oh, for God's sake.

16:18.285 --> 16:21.286
Uh, this is Officer
DeLuca at Superior Donuts.

16:21.288 --> 16:23.555
We need an ambulance for, um...

16:23.557 --> 16:26.125
You know, there's
really no code for this.

16:26.127 --> 16:28.627
Just come.

16:30.234 --> 16:32.999
Might be a muscle thing,
might be a slipped disc.

16:33.070 --> 16:35.342
At your age, we should get you
to the hospital for an MRI...

16:35.367 --> 16:37.105
No. No, no, no. No hospital.

16:37.107 --> 16:38.264
No hos... Look, I'm fine, huh?

16:38.289 --> 16:39.709
I can walk.

16:39.835 --> 16:42.469
I just don't feel like
walking right this minute.

16:42.471 --> 16:44.004
Why don't you go check on Franco?

16:44.006 --> 16:45.672
Man, he's the one that needs it.

16:49.582 --> 16:51.816
Hmm. I see you ran out of white people.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.503
Arthur, go to the hospital.

16:57.528 --> 16:58.613
No, no, no, nope.

16:58.660 --> 17:00.259
Don't like hospitals,
don't like doctors.

17:00.261 --> 17:01.361
Well, why not?

17:01.363 --> 17:02.962
Because at my age, they
start poking around,

17:02.964 --> 17:05.832
and they find one little
thing, and they want more tests,

17:05.834 --> 17:08.300
and the next thing you
know, you never leave.

17:08.803 --> 17:09.584
Don't you think

17:09.608 --> 17:11.021
you're getting a little
ahead of yourself?

17:11.053 --> 17:11.949
Oh, am I?

17:11.973 --> 17:14.107
Everybody around here
thinks I'm too old.

17:14.108 --> 17:16.275
Oh, Arthur, they don't think that.

17:16.277 --> 17:17.779
They know it.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.146
All right, rest up.

17:20.147 --> 17:22.214
I'm gonna go check on Franco.

17:22.217 --> 17:24.384
Dude, I'm telling you, man, I
don't need to go to a hospital.

17:24.386 --> 17:26.085
And I'm telling you your foot is broken.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.109
And you need a cast

17:27.135 --> 17:29.821
- that's not made out of a Cathy cartoon.
- Man.

17:29.846 --> 17:31.126
Go check on Arthur.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.525
He's the one who needs the help.

17:32.527 --> 17:34.961
What am I supposed to do, DeLuca?

17:34.963 --> 17:36.829
I can't force them to
get into the ambulance.

17:36.831 --> 17:39.098
I know. They're both so stubborn.

17:39.207 --> 17:42.375
The only thing they agree on is
that the other one needs help.

17:42.377 --> 17:45.144
Oh, I got an idea.

17:45.146 --> 17:47.413
So...

17:48.549 --> 17:51.134
Franco is still refusing
to go to the hospital.

17:51.159 --> 17:52.885
Oh, that stubborn son of a bitch.

17:52.887 --> 17:55.488
I know, I know.

17:55.490 --> 17:57.590
You know, here's the thing.

17:57.592 --> 17:59.492
If you go in the ambulance,

17:59.494 --> 18:02.395
maybe we can get him to
go and look after you.

18:02.397 --> 18:03.596
- You think?
- Yeah.

18:03.598 --> 18:04.864
He worries about you.

18:04.866 --> 18:07.033
Oh, and you know what
would really convince him?

18:07.035 --> 18:09.368
If you play up that
"old and feeble" thing.

18:09.370 --> 18:10.503
Um, I...

18:10.505 --> 18:13.840
- I could try.
- Yeah.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.942
And then, you know, when
you're at the hospital,

18:15.944 --> 18:18.744
I bet you could get him
to x-ray that damn foot.

18:18.746 --> 18:19.912
Yeah.

18:19.914 --> 18:21.156
He-he looks up to me.

18:21.181 --> 18:23.115
Oh, yes.

18:23.117 --> 18:24.350
He does.

18:24.352 --> 18:27.653
You're like his white, magical Negro.

18:29.957 --> 18:31.900
You know, I've thought that.

18:33.799 --> 18:35.094
I'm gonna go talk to Franco.

18:35.096 --> 18:36.195
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:36.197 --> 18:37.630
Okay.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.434
So, I don't know what to do.

18:41.436 --> 18:43.069
I can't get Arthur

18:43.071 --> 18:44.470
to go to the hospital.

18:44.472 --> 18:46.352
That stubborn son of a bitch.

18:47.075 --> 18:48.941
I know.

18:48.943 --> 18:51.344
I think he's afraid of doctors.

18:51.346 --> 18:54.313
You know, it's scary
when you get to be old.

18:54.315 --> 18:56.148
Look at him.

18:56.150 --> 18:59.952
Oh! Damn my brittle bones.

18:59.954 --> 19:01.821
You see?

19:01.823 --> 19:02.922
Now, I think

19:02.924 --> 19:05.992
he would go if you went
to keep him company.

19:05.994 --> 19:07.927
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.228
He needs an MRI,

19:09.230 --> 19:10.630
and it might ease his fears

19:10.632 --> 19:13.566
if you were getting...
I don't know... an x-ray?

19:13.568 --> 19:14.967
We have the money.

19:14.969 --> 19:16.269
I don't know, Randy.

19:16.271 --> 19:17.570
I don't like taking from people.

19:17.572 --> 19:19.772
You know, I don't like
having to owe them.

19:19.774 --> 19:21.374
Well, think about it this way.

19:21.376 --> 19:23.175
The money's not gonna help you.

19:23.177 --> 19:25.544
The money's gonna help Arthur.

19:25.546 --> 19:28.381
All right, well, since
you put it that way...

19:28.383 --> 19:29.982
Cool. All right.

19:29.984 --> 19:31.017
Great.

19:31.019 --> 19:32.218
Yo, Arthur,

19:32.220 --> 19:34.954
who wants to go on an ambulance ride?

19:34.956 --> 19:39.091
Only if you go with me.

19:39.093 --> 19:40.226
I mean, who knows

19:40.228 --> 19:43.045
when the Grim Reaper will call my name?

19:44.998 --> 19:47.800
- Take it down a notch, Pacino.
- Yeah.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.661
Hey, what'd I tell you kids

19:56.686 --> 20:00.140
about using those things in the house?

20:00.142 --> 20:01.565
Nah, we're about to send a message

20:01.590 --> 20:03.043
to those Blessed Heart girls.

20:03.045 --> 20:04.542
This is our corner. The block is hot.

20:04.567 --> 20:05.511
Blap, blap!

20:05.536 --> 20:07.080
Yo, homes.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.948
We're going to chop 'em
down with our water gats.

20:08.950 --> 20:10.726
Huh? Am I a thug? Was that hard?

20:10.751 --> 20:12.650
It was hard to listen to.

20:12.954 --> 20:14.882
Well, I'm glad you're
both feeling better.

20:14.907 --> 20:17.132
Yeah, thanks to my brand new cast.

20:17.157 --> 20:18.792
And I appreciate that, y'all.

20:18.794 --> 20:21.628
Growing up, I didn't have a
lot of people I could depend on,

20:21.630 --> 20:24.273
and I got used to doing
everything by myself.

20:24.298 --> 20:26.235
Well, get over it. You've
got a roomful of people

20:26.260 --> 20:27.659
you can depend on.

20:27.836 --> 20:29.869
Thank you.

20:29.871 --> 20:31.738
That was beautiful.

20:31.740 --> 20:34.483
Wish those monkey drugs
hadn't dried up my tear ducts.

20:36.912 --> 20:37.717
Here they come.

20:37.742 --> 20:39.139
They're talking about geometry

20:39.164 --> 20:41.278
and a dreamy boy named Trevor.

20:41.303 --> 20:42.591
Show them no mercy!

20:43.552 --> 20:45.067
Hello, ladies.

20:45.092 --> 20:47.020
And I hope you know how to swim.

20:47.045 --> 20:48.867
- Oy.
- Ow.

20:48.898 --> 20:49.781
- Oy.
- Ow.

20:49.805 --> 20:50.710
- Oy.
- Ow.

20:50.734 --> 20:51.636
Oy.

20:51.660 --> 20:57.464
Oy vay.
