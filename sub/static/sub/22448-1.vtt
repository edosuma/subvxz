02:22.149 --> 02:23.372
Coffee?

02:29.556 --> 02:31.447
You know what you want?

02:35.095 --> 02:36.952
I'll be right back.

03:14.434 --> 03:18.225
It's not libel if it's true. We've gotta
tell the client we can't do this work.

03:18.305 --> 03:20.998
We file this lawsuit, I swear...

03:24.378 --> 03:27.110
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

03:27.190 --> 03:30.170
- He's sleeping with Anita.
- No way. She's not even hot.

03:30.250 --> 03:31.607
Like I care.

03:33.354 --> 03:37.553
Come on, guys. They traded
this prick for three draft picks...

03:37.633 --> 03:39.514
none of them worth spit.

03:40.828 --> 03:43.810
Sit up straight and eat your food.
You never listen.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.704
All you do is fool around.
You never take anything seriously.

03:47.784 --> 03:49.674
Sorry, Dad.

04:14.693 --> 04:16.584
Can I help you?

04:18.560 --> 04:22.424
How about you just turn your ass around
and get the fuck out of here?

04:24.136 --> 04:26.378
You just back up there.

04:55.835 --> 04:58.125
<i>Do I look crazy to you?</i>

04:58.205 --> 05:00.861
<i>Unhinged? Maybe I am.</i>

05:00.941 --> 05:04.800
<i>But before you rush to judgment,
let's rewind a bit.</i>

05:25.598 --> 05:30.224
Which is why he's gonna choose our firm
to defend him and not some cut-rate LLP...

05:30.304 --> 05:32.326
with a radio commercial
and a catchy jingle.

05:32.406 --> 05:35.696
<i>Women speak approximately
20,000 words a day.</i>

05:35.776 --> 05:38.299
Yeah, you know, some not guilty.

05:38.379 --> 05:41.468
I want to spend an extra million
or two on that, all right?

05:41.548 --> 05:44.171
<i>Men 17,000.</i>

05:44.851 --> 05:46.674
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

05:46.754 --> 05:49.943
This is not what I think.
This is what it is.

05:50.023 --> 05:54.382
Another victim of the systemic
racism inherent in the police force.

05:54.462 --> 05:57.251
<i>I spoke around 80,000 words a day.</i>

05:57.331 --> 06:01.201
My two favorite letters. N-G.

06:01.401 --> 06:05.427
- Not guilty.
- <i>Words were my weapon of choice.</i>

06:06.706 --> 06:10.164
<i>But out of those 80,000 words
I spoke a day...</i>

06:10.844 --> 06:13.535
<i>do you know how many
are really important?</i>

06:14.847 --> 06:16.133
<i>Three.</i>

06:16.483 --> 06:18.472
I love you.

06:18.552 --> 06:19.942
Come here.

06:21.688 --> 06:24.553
<i>Three words total out of 80,000.</i>

06:25.825 --> 06:27.481
I love you.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.452
<i>Not a good ratio.</i>

06:49.248 --> 06:51.605
Frank, you were supposed
to be here half an hour ago.

06:51.685 --> 06:55.008
- The place is really starting to fill up.
- I know, I know. I'm sorry.

06:55.088 --> 06:59.381
- I'm heading down to the garage right now.
- Olivia wants to talk to you.

07:02.828 --> 07:04.617
Hi, Daddy.

07:04.697 --> 07:06.687
Hi, sweetheart.

07:06.767 --> 07:08.922
You're coming, right?

07:09.002 --> 07:11.502
- I'm on my way.
- Good.

07:11.582 --> 07:14.338
'Cause I think you're gonna
love my performance.

07:14.418 --> 07:17.531
- Promise you'll be here?
- I promise.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.468
I love you.

07:21.881 --> 07:23.406
Shit.

07:26.185 --> 07:28.476
Wait. Wait.

07:34.260 --> 07:36.485
Frank, you got a minute?

07:54.780 --> 07:57.504
Okay, you've got to sign these too.
We've got to ship them out tonight.

07:57.584 --> 08:00.838
Luckily there was a case argued
just recently on the supreme court.

08:00.918 --> 08:05.198
For three reasons acquittals should have
full effect under the double jeopardy...

08:09.195 --> 08:12.467
Olivia, you're next.

08:46.499 --> 08:48.689
This is my daddy's favorite song.

08:48.769 --> 08:51.460
He and I always sing it together.

08:58.217 --> 09:00.826
<i>Dream</i>

09:00.856 --> 09:03.392
<i>Dream, dream, dream</i>

09:03.472 --> 09:05.858
<i>Dream</i>

09:05.938 --> 09:08.142
<i>Dream, dream, dream</i>

09:13.956 --> 09:15.852
<i>To hold me tight</i>

09:15.932 --> 09:18.817
<i>Whenever I want you</i>

09:18.897 --> 09:21.004
<i>All I have to do</i>

09:21.084 --> 09:23.464
<i>Is dream</i>

09:23.544 --> 09:26.084
<i>Dream, dream, dream</i>

09:31.888 --> 09:33.702
<i>Dream</i>

09:33.782 --> 09:35.985
<i>Dream</i>

10:00.806 --> 10:02.996
Hi, it's Sue. Please leave a message.

10:03.076 --> 10:05.532
Susan. Listen, I'm sorry.

10:05.612 --> 10:08.635
Things just got away from me at work.

10:09.015 --> 10:12.065
Call me back, please. I'm sorry.

11:05.103 --> 11:09.562
- Hi, it's Sue. Please leave a message.
- Sue. Listen...

11:10.444 --> 11:14.935
Listen, I know you're upset
with me, but please call me back.

11:15.415 --> 11:18.902
It's getting late, and I'm worried
about you guys, okay?

12:05.531 --> 12:09.222
- Mr. Valera, I'm Detective Lustiger.
- Where are they?

12:09.302 --> 12:12.225
Are they okay? Where are they?

12:12.305 --> 12:14.162
Mr. Valera.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.331
Mr. Valera.

12:18.811 --> 12:20.702
Mr. Valera!

12:22.615 --> 12:25.171
We're still waiting for the forensic team.

12:25.251 --> 12:30.176
Frank! Frank! I can't let you
contaminate the crime scene.

12:30.256 --> 12:31.813
Frank!

12:42.301 --> 12:45.392
My baby. That's my baby.

12:45.472 --> 12:48.862
- That's my baby!
- Hold him back!

12:48.942 --> 12:51.600
Let me go. Let me go!

12:52.778 --> 12:55.836
Let me go! Susan!

12:57.117 --> 12:58.939
Let me go!

12:59.419 --> 13:02.877
Get him back! Get him back!

13:10.763 --> 13:14.087
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

13:14.167 --> 13:16.857
He makes me lie down in green pastures.

13:16.937 --> 13:19.192
He leads me beside the still waters.

13:19.272 --> 13:21.194
He restores my soul.

13:21.274 --> 13:25.866
He leads me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

13:25.946 --> 13:29.569
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

13:29.649 --> 13:33.542
I will fear no evil, for you are with me.

13:42.094 --> 13:45.586
Chances are they'll never catch
the people who killed them.

13:46.466 --> 13:50.690
And even if they do catch them,
some slick-tongued defense attorney...

13:50.770 --> 13:52.559
will probably get them off...

13:52.639 --> 13:57.917
some slick-tongued defense
attorney just like you.

14:01.113 --> 14:04.204
I always kept my tongue quiet
while my daughter was alive...

14:04.284 --> 14:07.507
but I never saw what she saw in you.

14:07.867 --> 14:10.644
She left her family, friends behind...

14:10.724 --> 14:13.413
she followed you across the country...

14:13.493 --> 14:15.879
put your needs ahead of her own...

14:15.959 --> 14:19.820
but as long as my daughter
was happy, I was happy.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.056
Now that my daughter is dead...

14:23.136 --> 14:25.226
and my granddaughter...

14:26.176 --> 14:29.264
I'll tell you what I think of you,
Frank Valera...

14:31.144 --> 14:33.167
you're all talk.

14:33.847 --> 14:36.736
You make your living spinning words...

14:36.816 --> 14:39.275
into meanings that are vague...

14:39.355 --> 14:41.975
and hazy and unclear...

14:42.455 --> 14:46.656
all just to exonerate
the scum of the earth.

14:47.026 --> 14:49.182
And from this moment on...

14:49.262 --> 14:54.721
I do not ever want to hear
your mealy-mouthed voice again.

14:55.501 --> 14:57.358
Am I understood?

14:58.688 --> 15:01.128
- Jeff...
- I said...

15:01.558 --> 15:06.018
I never want to hear your voice again.

15:07.679 --> 15:09.905
A nod will suffice.

17:53.078 --> 17:56.937
<i>Without a break in the case,
all the police could do was talk.</i>

17:57.017 --> 17:59.806
<i>Empty words to appease. A familiar game.</i>

17:59.886 --> 18:02.242
Your wife's car was expertly wiped down.

18:02.322 --> 18:04.945
<i>My wife and daughter murdered.</i>

18:05.025 --> 18:07.247
<i>Their killer still out there
roaming the street.</i>

18:07.327 --> 18:12.197
- Maybe they knew what they were doing.
- <i>And all anyone could do was talk.</i>

18:13.169 --> 18:16.023
And there wasn't any evidence
at the crime scene, right?

18:16.703 --> 18:18.971
Found these tiny gold fibers.

18:19.051 --> 18:20.928
Gold fibers?

18:21.941 --> 18:26.721
I don't think my wife or Olivia were wearing
anything gold that night, were they?

18:26.801 --> 18:30.637
- No.
- So then, that's a lead, right?

18:30.717 --> 18:32.243
Well...

18:33.000 --> 18:35.564
I talked to a tailor downtown.
He said it was a very common thread.

18:35.644 --> 18:37.512
It's not much of a lead.

18:40.192 --> 18:41.915
And there are still no witnesses?

18:41.995 --> 18:44.517
None have come forward,
but we're still looking.

18:44.597 --> 18:48.538
That area is a notorious stomping ground
for the Oreversakonya.

18:48.618 --> 18:51.391
- What was that?
- Russian mafia.

18:51.471 --> 18:54.695
They have a stranglehold in that area.
It's hard to get anyone to talk.

18:55.675 --> 19:00.000
Would it have been the Russian mafia,
like, robbery or a carjacking or something?

19:00.080 --> 19:03.603
You guys never found my wife's purse.

19:03.703 --> 19:07.107
Pretty violent for a purse-snatching,
don't you think, Frank?

19:08.087 --> 19:09.976
Or carjacking?

19:10.356 --> 19:12.928
- Why'd they leave the car?
- I don't know.

19:13.008 --> 19:17.051
Maybe something went terribly wrong
and they had to flee, I don't know.

19:18.230 --> 19:20.313
We are exhausting all leads.

19:20.393 --> 19:24.090
You don't need to keep coming down here,
Frank. I'll call you if anything comes up.

19:24.170 --> 19:28.228
I'll call you even if something doesn't,
just to keep you informed.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.264
Detective Lustiger...

19:31.744 --> 19:34.165
will you please stop texting, sir?

19:43.555 --> 19:45.860
Can I see the file on the case?

19:49.461 --> 19:51.684
Chief wants a word with you, Bill.

19:51.964 --> 19:54.172
Tell him I'll be right there.

19:56.969 --> 19:58.526
Please.

19:59.504 --> 20:01.094
No.

20:01.274 --> 20:04.784
It's confidential. It's police business.

20:05.744 --> 20:07.867
It is my wife and my daughter.

20:07.947 --> 20:11.904
Frank, I am trying to find out who
did this and to bring them into justice.

20:11.984 --> 20:14.207
Well, try harder. Goddamn it!

20:14.287 --> 20:17.377
You have any idea how often
a violent crime is committed in this country?

20:17.457 --> 20:21.080
- No, I...
- Every 25.3 seconds, Frank.

20:21.160 --> 20:25.785
That means for the 25.3 minutes you sat here,
60 violent crimes have been committed.

20:25.865 --> 20:27.388
Really?

20:32.071 --> 20:33.768
You okay?

20:35.074 --> 20:36.964
Am I okay?

20:38.010 --> 20:39.867
I'll never be okay.

20:40.747 --> 20:42.570
Mr. Valera.

20:45.384 --> 20:47.141
We never give up.

20:48.287 --> 20:49.827
Yeah.

22:34.639 --> 22:37.218
Kill him! Tackle him!

22:51.676 --> 22:54.301
Come on! Come on!

23:06.057 --> 23:09.697
<i>It became clear to me
that justice would never be served.</i>

23:18.103 --> 23:20.560
<i>I made my family a promise...</i>

23:20.640 --> 23:23.664
<i>but my words were as empty
as everyone else's.</i>

23:27.612 --> 23:29.671
<i>I was the guilty one.</i>

23:55.174 --> 23:57.865
Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him!

24:16.195 --> 24:18.620
<i>I'd found my form of penance.</i>

25:28.433 --> 25:29.656
What are you doing?

25:29.736 --> 25:33.359
<i>My associates suggested
I take some time off.</i>

25:34.039 --> 25:37.330
<i>Mental-health days, they called it.</i>

25:37.910 --> 25:42.391
<i>Although I know it was really because
they didn't want me around anymore.</i>

25:43.166 --> 25:46.591
<i>Frankly, the feeling was mutual.</i>

25:50.055 --> 25:53.310
- I need time.
- <i>Defending suspected criminals...</i>

25:53.390 --> 25:56.727
<i>was something I'd lost my taste for.</i>

26:01.933 --> 26:04.991
Break it up! Stop!

26:36.735 --> 26:41.594
I suppose you're wondering, what is a nice
guy like me doing in a place like this?

26:41.674 --> 26:43.965
Something like that, yeah.

26:52.015 --> 26:56.070
I promised I'd meet them at my daughter's
talent show the night they were killed.

26:59.124 --> 27:00.976
I should've been there for them.

27:01.056 --> 27:03.783
The last message I ever got
from my wife was...

27:03.863 --> 27:07.689
a text of a video she took
of a performance I missed.

27:09.067 --> 27:12.115
Yeah. Gave them my word...

27:13.072 --> 27:14.896
then I broke it.

27:16.625 --> 27:18.466
It's killing me.

27:21.179 --> 27:23.205
Frank, you can't blame yourself
for what happened.

27:23.285 --> 27:25.303
Oh, believe me, I can.

27:29.087 --> 27:30.943
What about you?

27:31.423 --> 27:35.848
You're not in a police uniform, which means
you're not here to bust the fights up.

27:36.428 --> 27:39.575
- You follow me here or something?
- This job, Frank...

27:40.433 --> 27:42.894
it's a fucking war zone out there.

27:44.103 --> 27:46.126
The way people feel about cops...

27:47.406 --> 27:51.322
sometimes I just gotta blow off
a little steam, you know?

27:52.811 --> 27:55.301
Of course, if the department knew
that I sometimes mixed it up...

27:55.381 --> 27:57.804
in the underground fight circuit, well...

27:58.384 --> 28:00.962
wouldn't be too good
for my career in law enforcement.

28:09.761 --> 28:13.053
You know, I was sorry to hear that...

28:13.433 --> 28:16.089
they're going to re-prioritize your case.

28:17.769 --> 28:19.593
What the hell are you talking about?

28:21.506 --> 28:25.732
Your case has been re-prioritized from
active to cold. I thought you knew.

28:26.312 --> 28:28.401
- Why?
- Frank, it's been a long time.

28:28.481 --> 28:31.971
You know, we've got no fresh leads.
I mean, it's hard.

28:32.051 --> 28:35.480
- The case is dead?
- No, it's not dead, it's just...

28:36.160 --> 28:37.203
cold.

28:37.283 --> 28:40.583
Those are fucking semantics,
and you know it.

28:40.663 --> 28:44.950
You know, this is a way of twisting words
around. Believe me, I know about it.

28:45.030 --> 28:47.842
I've made a lot of money doing that.

28:53.172 --> 28:57.198
Look, I'll stay on top of Lustiger.
You know, try and keep it in his mind.

28:59.894 --> 29:01.736
Talk is cheap?

29:16.194 --> 29:18.052
Hey, mister.

29:20.952 --> 29:24.759
You looking for company tonight?

29:26.534 --> 29:29.007
I can make you feel good if you want.

29:30.009 --> 29:32.885
You could do anything.

29:32.965 --> 29:35.569
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

29:37.081 --> 29:39.505
What are you doing out here?

29:39.785 --> 29:42.810
You're too young to be here.
How old are you?

29:44.456 --> 29:47.483
Answer me. How old are you?

29:47.993 --> 29:49.515
Thirteen.

29:49.895 --> 29:51.150
Thirteen.

29:51.230 --> 29:52.753
Shit.

29:58.502 --> 30:00.259
Get your ass over here.

30:00.339 --> 30:02.261
I'm sorry, buddy.

30:02.341 --> 30:05.298
She thought you were somebody else.
Let's go.

30:05.378 --> 30:08.389
Please, sir.
This girl is someone's daughter.

30:28.166 --> 30:30.437
<i>If I could have been
listening more closely...</i>

30:30.517 --> 30:32.736
<i>if I would have been listening
at all...</i>

30:32.816 --> 30:35.229
<i>I probably would have heard it.</i>

32:11.499 --> 32:13.910
<i>Finding the book was a sign.</i>

32:14.940 --> 32:17.997
<i>I had been punishing myself
for their deaths...</i>

32:18.677 --> 32:21.333
<i>but I wasn't the one
who killed them.</i>

32:21.613 --> 32:24.238
<i>I had been punishing
the wrong person.</i>

34:33.311 --> 34:37.123
<i>Meditations was written
nearly 2,000 years ago...</i>

34:37.666 --> 34:40.873
<i>and became the basis for stoicism...</i>

34:41.353 --> 34:42.806
<i>which believed...</i>

34:42.886 --> 34:46.678
<i>that the best indication
of an individual's philosophy...</i>

34:46.757 --> 34:48.614
<i>was not what he said...</i>

34:49.293 --> 34:51.351
<i>but rather what he did.</i>

34:52.831 --> 34:57.717
<i>Stoics would take a vow of silence
in order to focus on a specific task.</i>

34:58.337 --> 35:01.894
<i>It is why I took my own vow
not to be broken...</i>

35:01.974 --> 35:05.399
<i>until I avenged my wife
and daughter's murders.</i>

36:51.982 --> 36:54.273
<i>Within days after I stopped talking...</i>

36:54.353 --> 36:57.609
<i>my sense of hearing
had drastically improved.</i>

36:57.989 --> 36:59.279
<i>You see?</i>

36:59.359 --> 37:03.600
<i>Good things do happen when you
shut the fuck up for a minute or two.</i>

39:22.300 --> 39:23.892
Hey.

39:34.462 --> 39:36.303
Nice ride, my man.

39:38.048 --> 39:41.110
But unfortunately you're in our territory,
so how about you just give me...

39:41.190 --> 39:44.483
your wallet and car keys,
and we'll call it even.

39:48.526 --> 39:51.151
<i>Could these be the men
who killed them?</i>

39:52.997 --> 39:55.512
<i>A carjacking gone terribly wrong.</i>

40:08.813 --> 40:10.681
Come on!

40:17.148 --> 40:20.446
Fucking dumb piece of shit!

41:23.620 --> 41:25.045
Please.

41:37.318 --> 41:41.962
<i>I wanted to search his face
for the slightest hint of recognition.</i>

41:43.911 --> 41:46.333
<i>He had no idea who they were.</i>

43:07.925 --> 43:09.815
Are you okay?

44:10.955 --> 44:12.846
My name is Alma.

44:15.325 --> 44:18.316
I'm an E.R. nurse over at Mercy.

44:18.396 --> 44:21.801
I volunteer at the local homeless shelter.

44:22.833 --> 44:24.788
And you are?

44:30.307 --> 44:32.163
Are you okay?

44:32.943 --> 44:35.736
Do you understand me?
Â¿Me comprende?

44:35.816 --> 44:37.703
Can you hear me?

44:39.599 --> 44:42.224
Do you remember anything about yesterday?

44:43.284 --> 44:45.545
About how you got here?

44:48.358 --> 44:50.715
I was coming home from the hospital...

44:50.795 --> 44:53.928
and I found you lying in the road.

44:54.008 --> 44:56.888
So I helped you over here.

44:57.168 --> 45:01.527
You were really out of it,
and that's when I discovered...

45:02.207 --> 45:04.195
you'd been shot.

45:04.675 --> 45:07.299
Let me check it out. Okay?

45:07.779 --> 45:11.703
You're lucky.
The bullet only grazed you...

45:11.783 --> 45:14.808
so the wound was pretty easy to dress.

45:16.754 --> 45:18.278
Hey.

47:20.011 --> 47:23.434
<i>Why would Susan roll down
her window in the rain?</i>

47:24.014 --> 47:25.138
<i>Why?</i>

47:34.458 --> 47:35.882
Hi.

47:39.346 --> 47:41.755
You left this at my house.

47:46.349 --> 47:49.363
Your address is on your
driver's license.

47:51.108 --> 47:54.133
Plus, I have to re-check your wound.

48:12.029 --> 48:13.920
You were very lucky.

48:23.357 --> 48:25.814
You don't have me fooled, you know.

48:25.894 --> 48:27.750
I know you can talk.

48:30.547 --> 48:33.571
Last night, after I bandaged you up...

48:34.551 --> 48:36.409
you talked in your sleep.

48:37.354 --> 48:41.864
And if you can talk in your sleep,
you can talk when you are awake.

48:47.281 --> 48:50.556
You kept saying two names
over and over...

48:51.736 --> 48:53.626
Sue and Olivia.

49:09.619 --> 49:11.791
Your wife and daughter?

49:24.267 --> 49:26.292
I am so sorry.

50:03.280 --> 50:05.364
Was their killer ever caught?

50:17.741 --> 50:20.113
I know that area very well.

50:21.758 --> 50:24.217
I drive through it on my way
to work.

50:31.518 --> 50:33.743
Let me know if you need any help.

51:09.506 --> 51:12.261
<i>A transportation security dog.</i>

51:14.317 --> 51:18.536
<i>Trained to sniff out the smallest of scents
in the most densely populated areas...</i>

51:18.616 --> 51:20.640
<i>with military precision.</i>

51:27.641 --> 51:31.317
<i>I wonder if my new friend
could fill in some blanks.</i>

52:46.236 --> 52:50.428
<i>The homeless encampment I had found
if anyone was there that night...</i>

52:50.508 --> 52:52.997
<i>they would have been
the perfect witness.</i>

52:53.077 --> 52:55.535
<i>Maybe even the perfect killer.</i>

54:39.782 --> 54:41.505
No fever.

54:41.585 --> 54:43.474
You are going to be okay, honey.

54:44.854 --> 54:48.287
- The doctor will come soon.
- Thank you very much.

54:54.331 --> 54:56.354
You have something for me?

54:57.034 --> 54:58.924
I told you it was done.

55:01.704 --> 55:03.761
Nobody is done.

55:04.341 --> 55:06.198
Not until I say so.

55:09.846 --> 55:11.738
I'll be seeing you soon.

55:31.234 --> 55:34.558
Yeah, I know this spot.
It's Mr. Shivers' place.

55:34.638 --> 55:37.661
Sometimes on my way home
from the night shift...

55:37.741 --> 55:40.064
I see him around here...

55:40.144 --> 55:41.968
always smoking.

55:44.013 --> 55:47.138
But I've never interacted with him.

55:47.218 --> 55:49.474
Actually, I never saw his face.

55:50.154 --> 55:53.276
So I wouldn't be able
to I.D. him for you.

55:53.356 --> 55:55.247
I'm sorry.

55:56.759 --> 55:59.283
But I heard he works sometimes...

55:59.363 --> 56:01.788
at the local diner as a fry cook.

56:04.568 --> 56:06.592
We don't know his real name.

56:08.104 --> 56:10.745
People at the shelter
call him Mr. Shivers...

56:10.825 --> 56:13.065
because he gives them the creeps.

56:14.912 --> 56:18.828
They say he has this really
violent attitude.

56:36.082 --> 56:37.923
Thanks, Frank.

56:59.856 --> 57:03.014
You and I need to talk.
Where are my drugs?

57:03.094 --> 57:05.082
I don't want to do this anymore.

57:05.162 --> 57:06.684
Listen.

57:07.364 --> 57:11.088
You will do as I tell you, understood?

57:11.168 --> 57:13.392
- Yes.
- Shut up!

57:46.109 --> 57:47.960
Those guys...

57:49.005 --> 57:51.229
they came into the E.R...

57:51.829 --> 57:53.626
about a year ago...

57:55.745 --> 57:57.970
forcing me to pay protection.

57:59.816 --> 58:02.440
Have me steal drugs for them.

58:02.520 --> 58:04.375
From the hospital, you know.

58:04.455 --> 58:07.280
Oxy, codeine, fentanyl.

58:08.658 --> 58:11.350
But the other day
I told them I was done.

58:16.699 --> 58:19.054
They're gonna kill me
for this, Frank.

58:21.070 --> 58:22.928
What am I going to do?

59:50.360 --> 59:53.586
Nobody ever accused me
of being able to cook.

59:55.732 --> 59:58.856
But I figured that one breakfast...

59:58.936 --> 01:00:01.360
was the least I could do to thank you.

01:00:09.145 --> 01:00:13.026
You know, I've been thinking
about the guy you are looking for...

01:00:13.106 --> 01:00:14.671
Mr. Shivers.

01:00:14.751 --> 01:00:19.132
Like I said, I've never worked
with him directly at the shelter, but...

01:00:21.924 --> 01:00:24.348
but he had this cough...

01:00:24.678 --> 01:00:28.100
a hacking cough
you'd recognize anywhere.

01:00:50.653 --> 01:00:53.243
<i>Do I still look crazy to you?</i>

01:00:53.323 --> 01:00:56.046
<i>Unhinged? Like a maniac?</i>

01:00:56.126 --> 01:00:58.150
<i>All of the above?</i>

01:01:00.063 --> 01:01:02.453
<i>Yeah. You're probably right.</i>

01:01:02.533 --> 01:01:05.240
<i>But at least now,
you understand why.</i>

01:01:14.177 --> 01:01:16.333
<i>He recognized them.</i>

01:01:16.413 --> 01:01:18.010
<i>But...</i>

01:01:18.882 --> 01:01:21.538
<i>there was no death
in this man's eyes.</i>

01:01:21.618 --> 01:01:23.596
<i>He wasn't their killer.</i>

01:01:26.022 --> 01:01:28.680
I saw what happened that night.

01:01:43.172 --> 01:01:45.385
It was a cop.

01:01:47.176 --> 01:01:52.237
I was there.
I saw the whole thing.

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:18.965
Mommy!

01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:35.214
Mommy! Mommy!

01:02:49.906 --> 01:02:52.763
He killed them in the warehouse.

01:02:52.843 --> 01:02:54.665
What could I do?

01:02:56.245 --> 01:02:59.144
I've got enough trouble already.

01:03:00.116 --> 01:03:03.743
I don't need no more trouble
with cops.

01:03:13.062 --> 01:03:15.022
The purse...

01:03:15.102 --> 01:03:16.920
got left behind.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.658
I took the money from it, and I...

01:03:19.738 --> 01:03:23.229
I got rid of it.
I needed the money, man.

01:03:25.842 --> 01:03:27.867
I'm sorry, man.

01:03:29.215 --> 01:03:31.023
I'm sorry.

01:03:32.752 --> 01:03:34.895
Open the door!

01:03:35.185 --> 01:03:37.469
Come on! Open this door now!

01:03:38.989 --> 01:03:41.246
Open this door right now!

01:03:51.301 --> 01:03:54.960
I just want to see my son.
Take me to see my son.

01:03:56.773 --> 01:03:59.030
Get your hands off me!

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:03.033
Hey! I didn't do nothing,
goddamn it!

01:04:03.113 --> 01:04:05.836
What'd I tell you?
Why don't you just let me go, man?

01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:07.671
- Cuff him!
- Motherfuckers!

01:04:07.751 --> 01:04:10.140
- Calm down!
- You need some help?

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:11.942
- Fuck you!
- Calm down!

01:04:12.022 --> 01:04:13.913
Keep moving!

01:04:45.488 --> 01:04:49.244
<i>I wanted to narrow my pool
of suspects by finding out...</i>

01:04:49.324 --> 01:04:53.450
<i>which officers were on duty the night
Shivers witnessed the killings.</i>

01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:55.051
<i>And of those officers...</i>

01:04:55.131 --> 01:04:59.424
<i>which one had been assigned
to patrol that particular district.</i>

01:05:05.575 --> 01:05:08.601
<i>I was surprised to discover
a familiar face.</i>

01:05:10.249 --> 01:05:12.037
<i>Could it really be him?</i>

01:07:20.646 --> 01:07:23.402
- Show him what you got!
- Hit him!

01:07:50.673 --> 01:07:54.131
<i>I followed Payton
for seven whole days and nights.</i>

01:07:55.411 --> 01:07:58.904
<i>I chased him as my demons
were chasing me.</i>

01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:03.307
<i>I even alternated between cars...</i>

01:08:03.387 --> 01:08:05.676
<i>as to not arouse suspicion.</i>

01:08:06.556 --> 01:08:08.845
<i>Night after night...</i>

01:08:09.125 --> 01:08:11.149
<i>day after day.</i>

01:08:13.195 --> 01:08:15.768
<i>All the while wondering...</i>

01:08:15.848 --> 01:08:20.640
<i>if this man truly was the one who
had killed my wife and daughter...</i>

01:08:21.037 --> 01:08:22.961
<i>then why?</i>

01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:26.015
<i>So I kept watching...</i>

01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:30.335
<i>trying to find an answer...</i>

01:08:31.529 --> 01:08:33.388
<i>a sign...</i>

01:08:34.216 --> 01:08:36.274
<i>or maybe a mistake.</i>

01:11:13.912 --> 01:11:17.335
- Found these tiny gold fibers.
- Gold fibers?

01:11:27.122 --> 01:11:28.712
Yes, officer?

01:11:28.792 --> 01:11:31.316
Can you please pull over
on the next road?

01:11:40.386 --> 01:11:41.965
Mommy!

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:45.196
Mommy!

01:12:58.814 --> 01:13:01.738
- The case is dead?
- It's not dead, it's just cold.

01:13:01.818 --> 01:13:06.144
This is a way of twisting words around.
I made a lot of money doing that.

01:16:10.138 --> 01:16:12.364
Now you know why I did it, Frank.

01:16:15.311 --> 01:16:18.136
Some creep you put back on the streets...

01:16:19.615 --> 01:16:21.640
killed my little girl.

01:16:25.253 --> 01:16:27.485
Twelve years old, Frank.

01:16:29.491 --> 01:16:31.581
Murdered by a guy...

01:16:31.961 --> 01:16:34.245
who should have been behind bars.

01:16:52.214 --> 01:16:54.435
This is where they died.

01:16:56.318 --> 01:16:58.577
Your wife was a fighter, Frank.

01:17:03.325 --> 01:17:05.150
But your little girl...

01:17:08.263 --> 01:17:10.687
well, she was screaming...

01:17:11.367 --> 01:17:13.823
crying for her daddy...

01:17:13.903 --> 01:17:15.760
to come and save her.

01:17:18.306 --> 01:17:20.164
But you didn't.

01:17:21.844 --> 01:17:23.669
Where were you, Frank?

01:17:26.331 --> 01:17:28.189
Where were you?

01:20:37.906 --> 01:20:42.033
<i>I wanted nothing more than to kill
the human monster before me...</i>

01:20:45.663 --> 01:20:49.507
<i>but that would make me no better
than him.</i>

01:20:51.069 --> 01:20:54.443
<i>Because the greatest stoic
of them all has said...</i>

01:20:54.523 --> 01:20:58.816
<i>The best revenge
is to be unlike your enemy.</i>

01:21:51.045 --> 01:21:52.895
What do you think about the verdict?

01:21:52.975 --> 01:21:56.439
The evidence against Officer Strode
was overwhelming.

01:21:56.519 --> 01:21:58.841
The department is very happy
with the verdict.

01:21:58.921 --> 01:22:02.179
There is nothing worse than a bad cop.

01:22:03.025 --> 01:22:07.085
- Detective, were there other cops involved?
- No, there's no evidence supporting that.

01:22:17.672 --> 01:22:20.495
<i>Justice had been served.</i>

01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:24.469
<i>I had tried to make things right.</i>

01:22:26.514 --> 01:22:29.974
<i>But I knew that nothing I did
would ever bring them back.</i>

01:22:34.389 --> 01:22:36.814
<i>And I could never go into the past...</i>

01:22:37.993 --> 01:22:40.819
<i>to be there for them, like I promised.</i>

01:22:43.565 --> 01:22:45.588
<i>If I could...</i>

01:22:45.668 --> 01:22:48.824
<i>I would tell my daughter
that she was right...</i>

01:22:49.204 --> 01:22:51.829
<i>I loved her performance.</i>

01:22:52.558 --> 01:22:57.099
<i>And I would tell them both the words
that still matter the most...</i>

01:22:57.179 --> 01:23:00.420
<i>among the thousands we speak every day.</i>

01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:02.990
I love you.
