WEBVTT

00:01.016 --> 00:02.815
Do you think I could be a bawd?

00:02.816 --> 00:05.635
- You'd make a fine bawd.
- As good as Charlotte?

00:05.660 --> 00:06.999
I've lost Golden Square.

00:07.024 --> 00:08.122
It's up for auction.

00:08.135 --> 00:09.686
- Will you bid?
- Will you?

00:09.687 --> 00:10.935
I want this place.

00:10.936 --> 00:13.319
So do I, but these
puckfists have more money.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.308
To the ladies.

00:15.309 --> 00:16.895
You've brought me into a molly house.

00:16.896 --> 00:19.335
Lucy Wells!

00:19.336 --> 00:21.135
She's easily played, I'm sure.

00:21.136 --> 00:23.535
I run all these girls for Hal Pincher,

00:23.536 --> 00:26.122
and I'm riding him for
England and St. George.

00:26.147 --> 00:27.506
I don't think I've given you my name.

00:27.530 --> 00:29.833
Isaac Pincher. There's a place
for you in our empire.

00:29.850 --> 00:32.598
These men are not what they say!
They are filthy, pimping scum!

00:33.788 --> 00:36.427
I have a daughter born out of wedlock.

00:36.428 --> 00:37.787
What else can I believe

00:37.788 --> 00:39.987
when you won't tell me who my father is?

00:39.988 --> 00:42.387
I wouldn't judge you
for loving a servant.

00:42.388 --> 00:45.507
Would you be daring too?

00:45.508 --> 00:46.827
Charles!

00:46.828 --> 00:48.307
What was your crime?

00:48.308 --> 00:50.747
I found a heaven in the hay.

00:50.748 --> 00:52.107
I am fallen.

00:52.108 --> 00:54.512
This is a bawdy and disorderly house!

00:54.537 --> 00:55.762
Who's the tavern keeper here?

00:55.787 --> 00:57.404
Do you bring the law down upon me?

00:57.429 --> 00:59.198
Stay away from our house, maggot.

00:59.223 --> 01:01.545
You stirred this strife,
so do what you like.

01:01.546 --> 01:03.409
But end it.

01:08.663 --> 01:11.229
These houses, let them all burn.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:42.150 --> 02:43.954
Not far now.

02:45.783 --> 02:47.062
Your bed awaits.

02:47.063 --> 02:48.862
And a meal fit for King George.

02:48.863 --> 02:50.422
Roast mutton and oysters.

02:54.487 --> 02:56.046
Pa?

03:02.538 --> 03:03.697
Lucy.

03:17.497 --> 03:20.216
You can blink, you know.
She won't disappear.

03:20.217 --> 03:21.816
How bad do you think the damage is?

03:21.817 --> 03:23.936
Well, you can all stay here. Work here.

03:23.937 --> 03:26.056
We'll, um... we'll make room.

03:26.057 --> 03:27.656
Thank you.

03:27.657 --> 03:29.296
Harriet!

03:30.577 --> 03:33.536
Mrs. Lennox. Jack Lively.

03:33.537 --> 03:35.136
We were to stay at Mr. North's.

03:35.137 --> 03:36.488
Are you one of his boxers?

03:36.489 --> 03:38.016
Where did he find you?

03:38.017 --> 03:40.536
He found me brawling in a
tavern on the Great North Road.

03:40.561 --> 03:42.840
Well, you can earn your keep.

03:42.865 --> 03:44.184
We need a bully.

03:44.209 --> 03:46.226
I know where he can lay his head.

03:50.937 --> 03:52.886
How can my own mother leave me here?

03:54.217 --> 03:56.016
She's a woman married to a man.

03:56.017 --> 03:57.496
Her power is not her own.

03:57.497 --> 03:59.658
A lesson all young girls should learn.

04:03.297 --> 04:05.016
When did you learn it?

04:05.017 --> 04:07.137
My father taught me young.

04:08.977 --> 04:10.296
And your mother?

04:10.297 --> 04:12.457
I killed her the day I was born.

04:15.217 --> 04:16.897
She died bearing you?

04:20.096 --> 04:22.296
Mrs. Quigley.

04:22.297 --> 04:25.816
How fortunate you are to have
such a gracious benefactor.

04:25.817 --> 04:30.216
Yes, in Lady Isabella, I am a
thousand times blessed.

04:30.217 --> 04:33.857
Miss Bottomley, we must,
quell that uterine fury.

04:35.417 --> 04:38.897
The cure I have in
mind is revolutionary.

04:49.417 --> 04:51.336
Cool your cockles. What's the rush?

04:51.337 --> 04:53.056
I'm refereeing a duel at 9:00.

04:53.057 --> 04:54.576
My pistol needs firing first.

04:54.577 --> 04:56.796
- What's it over? Money or cunny?
- Both.

04:56.821 --> 04:58.496
That's a dark way to settle a beef.

04:58.497 --> 05:00.976
These are turbulent times.

05:02.021 --> 05:03.992
Where there's a clash, I can make cash.

05:04.017 --> 05:08.976
Just tell me how you make real money.

05:08.977 --> 05:11.216
The... the big stuff?

05:11.217 --> 05:12.536
- Yeah.
- Well, you don't make it.

05:12.537 --> 05:13.936
Y-you grow it.

05:13.937 --> 05:15.736
Think of the coin like a seed.

05:15.737 --> 05:18.296
Now, if you just let it
sit, what would it do?

05:18.297 --> 05:21.096
Shrivel like a spinster's spinney.

05:21.097 --> 05:22.536
Yes, indeed.

05:22.537 --> 05:27.016
But tend it well, plant it in moist

05:27.017 --> 05:31.096
and fertile ground, and let it grow,

05:31.097 --> 05:33.016
and let it spring into life.

05:36.217 --> 05:39.497
Her note says she's gone
with the footman, Turner.

05:40.817 --> 05:42.356
Who knew about this?

05:43.457 --> 05:45.006
Who saw her leave?

05:46.818 --> 05:48.538
Who helped her pack?

05:50.337 --> 05:52.216
Search the town.

05:52.217 --> 05:54.496
Every street and coaching inn.

05:55.493 --> 05:57.173
She's just a young girl.

06:09.910 --> 06:11.992
You look like an altar covered in tar.

06:12.017 --> 06:13.456
Here.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.019
Found him loitering in the street.

06:16.020 --> 06:18.536
I'd have come before if I'd heard.

06:18.537 --> 06:20.816
Helped put the fire out.

06:20.817 --> 06:23.337
You can help by putting
Isaac Pincher behind bars.

06:24.697 --> 06:26.096
He's the one that set this.

06:26.097 --> 06:27.656
You'll find him at the Saracen's Head.

06:27.657 --> 06:28.736
Come on, let's go.

06:28.737 --> 06:31.017
Arson's a heavy accusation.

06:31.018 --> 06:32.976
Did anyone see him?

06:32.977 --> 06:35.107
- I did.
- At this house?

06:35.132 --> 06:37.011
Just a street away.

06:37.177 --> 06:38.896
But not here?

06:38.897 --> 06:40.896
Did that break itself?

06:40.897 --> 06:42.696
He was here.

06:42.697 --> 06:44.536
Kitty nearly died.

06:44.537 --> 06:46.176
Here little chest is still wheezing.

06:46.177 --> 06:48.416
All for the pride of a sap-filled cub.

06:49.259 --> 06:51.018
He needs to be stopped.

06:51.043 --> 06:53.082
There are many ways fires can start.

06:54.217 --> 06:55.297
Come on, Pa.

07:01.697 --> 07:03.456
Cluck, cluck, my chickens.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.617
Your squawking will set out our stall.

07:07.697 --> 07:09.736
Where is Lucy Wells?

07:09.737 --> 07:11.976
Mrs. May warned us she was a back-biter.

07:11.977 --> 07:13.937
Sayeth the Duchess of Duplicity.

07:15.417 --> 07:17.656
Vexatious girl.

07:17.657 --> 07:18.816
We can't wait forever.

07:18.841 --> 07:21.496
We've got a house to
stock with skin and skein.

07:21.497 --> 07:23.856
And a purse empty as Jacob's kettle.

07:30.417 --> 07:31.892
Emily.

07:33.377 --> 07:34.976
Charles is gone.

07:34.977 --> 07:37.096
To the sponging house?

07:37.097 --> 07:38.576
I warned the dolt.

07:38.577 --> 07:40.936
He fled before they got him.

07:40.937 --> 07:42.457
He said he'd never leave me.

07:43.977 --> 07:45.216
But he did.

07:45.217 --> 07:46.936
Charlie.

07:57.817 --> 07:59.737
You can sell your skins in here.

08:12.817 --> 08:16.656
Gold flows into this
place like rainfall.

08:16.657 --> 08:18.456
But you don't own the
floor you stand on.

08:18.457 --> 08:19.980
Shaky ground, Hal.

08:20.005 --> 08:22.936
You let your money puddle
in barrels in that cellar.

08:22.937 --> 08:24.656
You got plans for my coin?

08:25.657 --> 08:27.177
I'll buy you a new gown.

08:29.617 --> 08:30.956
Who's that?

08:30.981 --> 08:32.393
It's Cherry Dorrington.

08:32.394 --> 08:34.456
She's selling here now. Leave her be.

08:35.457 --> 08:38.456
Do you know how quickly
this can all turn to dust?

08:39.457 --> 08:42.336
If you want to keep it,
you need to invest.

08:42.337 --> 08:44.497
What does a buttock know of investment?

08:46.417 --> 08:48.256
Fly away home?

08:48.257 --> 08:50.536
That's what you say when you
set someone's house on fire?

08:56.496 --> 08:58.816
You're the rancid turd who set
my daughter's house on fire?

08:58.817 --> 09:01.736
I started no fire. Who are you?

09:01.737 --> 09:03.376
- He's my pa.
- Put him down!

09:03.377 --> 09:04.936
You gonna make me?

09:04.937 --> 09:05.956
Stop.

09:05.981 --> 09:07.301
I don't wanna have to arrest you.

09:12.057 --> 09:13.696
Drop the pup, Pa.

09:17.177 --> 09:20.417
Don't fret. I fight men me own size.

09:21.977 --> 09:24.176
Tell him where you were last night.

09:24.177 --> 09:26.817
I was here. Wasn't I, brother?

09:29.017 --> 09:31.216
- Just as every night.
- Liars!

09:31.217 --> 09:33.736
- You have witnesses?
- A roomful.

09:35.001 --> 09:39.241
This, fine gentleman I served ale.

09:40.737 --> 09:44.256
And this delightful young woman, well,

09:44.257 --> 09:47.416
it wouldn't be polite to say
how she knows where I was.

09:47.417 --> 09:49.416
All of them, liars!

09:49.417 --> 09:51.016
A hanged man speaks more truth.

09:51.017 --> 09:52.929
Nothing will be won by warring.

09:53.484 --> 09:55.791
Bring me proof or let this lie.

10:09.137 --> 10:10.736
He'll never back down.

10:10.737 --> 10:12.336
Why must I?

10:13.109 --> 10:16.192
You must because he won't.
I can't lose you too.

10:16.217 --> 10:18.736
But I can't leave those girls
without a house to work in.

10:19.937 --> 10:22.737
We'll bide our time and rebuild.

10:24.817 --> 10:26.177
How much do you have?

10:27.617 --> 10:29.136
Only what wouldn't melt.

10:30.137 --> 10:33.337
I'd stitched the money into
the curtains for safekeeping.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.576
Jack might've lost his
last couple of fights,

10:39.577 --> 10:41.776
but he won the rest.

10:41.777 --> 10:43.616
I'll show our town a
piece of his action,

10:43.617 --> 10:45.416
and I'll make it back.

10:45.417 --> 10:47.242
What am I supposed to do
while you dance around a ring?

10:47.266 --> 10:48.896
Sit and knit?

10:48.897 --> 10:50.256
Clean up the damage.

10:50.257 --> 10:51.816
Look after your brother and sister.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.356
Behave yourself.

10:54.257 --> 10:58.417
Trust that I will not see you struggle.

11:02.537 --> 11:03.856
All right.

11:09.577 --> 11:10.856
Thank you.

11:20.017 --> 11:21.976
Why could Charlotte Wells not roll over

11:21.977 --> 11:23.176
like any other jade?

11:23.177 --> 11:25.456
Every time, you go too far.

11:25.457 --> 11:27.936
You burn a woman's house
down and it's her fault?

11:27.937 --> 11:30.696
You again, screeching
like a cart's broken wheel.

11:34.617 --> 11:37.056
And you told me to end it.

11:37.057 --> 11:39.816
You thought I meant to roast
women and children in their beds?

11:39.817 --> 11:41.857
I meant end the fight.

11:44.417 --> 11:45.777
I can't take it back.

11:49.497 --> 11:51.576
You lied for him.

11:51.577 --> 11:53.857
He's my brother.

11:55.977 --> 11:58.057
I didn't know what he was gonna do.

12:01.857 --> 12:03.177
I promise.

12:14.897 --> 12:18.176
The house! Where is Charlotte?

12:18.177 --> 12:20.776
Pulling a Pincher's prick
through his nose, I hope.

12:20.777 --> 12:22.850
When will she return?

12:22.875 --> 12:25.300
When the task's done.

12:25.577 --> 12:28.777
You can, wait for Charlotte in here.

12:32.017 --> 12:34.577
Smoke mess isn't so bad in this room.

12:39.097 --> 12:40.817
Something's wrong.

12:43.684 --> 12:44.784
What is it?

12:46.057 --> 12:49.537
You don't need my problems
in the wake of this disaster.

12:51.057 --> 12:54.177
There isn't a secret you could
spill I haven't heard before.

12:56.657 --> 12:57.836
Tell me.

12:58.737 --> 13:01.816
My daughter has eloped with a servant.

13:01.817 --> 13:04.256
She learned of my scandal
and has made her own.

13:04.257 --> 13:07.136
She'll be ruined, and it's my fault.

13:07.137 --> 13:09.536
She won't be ruined.

13:09.537 --> 13:13.137
Her standing, maybe,
but not her own self.

13:14.297 --> 13:16.417
We are more than what people see.

13:26.677 --> 13:27.732
Salabat?

13:27.757 --> 13:30.736
There's no tear that can't be
fixed with the right stitch.

13:30.737 --> 13:33.257
Go and populate the house.

13:41.379 --> 13:43.258
Can I help you, Madam?

13:43.283 --> 13:46.576
Salabat, darling, don't
tell me you're still angry.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.896
You sound like Elizabeth Harvey.

13:48.897 --> 13:50.496
But you can't be.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.456
She was supposed to
accompany me on a voyage,

13:53.457 --> 13:56.376
but she left me waiting in the harbor,

13:56.377 --> 13:59.336
so I know some terrible
fate must have befallen her.

13:59.337 --> 14:00.796
You are still angry.

14:01.697 --> 14:03.536
I was taken suddenly ill.

14:05.017 --> 14:06.936
Wh...

14:06.937 --> 14:09.136
My carriage got lost.

14:09.137 --> 14:11.416
We were beset by thieves.

14:11.417 --> 14:14.736
I bought the Quigley
house in Golden Square.

14:23.061 --> 14:24.360
Lucy.

14:25.457 --> 14:26.657
I need you.

14:28.297 --> 14:29.697
I was always here.

14:37.497 --> 14:38.936
Told Pa I'd sit tight.

14:38.937 --> 14:40.617
Doesn't want me in harm's way.

14:42.817 --> 14:46.857
Promised him I wouldn't go after
Isaac Pincher or my money, so...

14:51.937 --> 14:53.156
Who's with me?

15:02.497 --> 15:04.256
I do my own laundry.

15:04.257 --> 15:05.976
Only man that does.

15:08.177 --> 15:10.857
Well, if you're staying, he should know.

15:12.417 --> 15:14.856
We lost a girl. My friend, Nell.

15:14.857 --> 15:16.536
What, to the pox?

15:16.537 --> 15:18.296
Taken by men, not malady.

15:18.297 --> 15:20.216
People snatchers?

15:20.217 --> 15:21.616
They haunt the streets at night

15:21.617 --> 15:23.496
and the girls disappear into the fog.

15:24.937 --> 15:27.136
How can a just society allow it?

15:27.137 --> 15:29.168
This is not a just town.

15:30.857 --> 15:33.657
Use that fire in your belly.

15:34.897 --> 15:36.476
I have a fight in mind.

15:37.377 --> 15:38.816
Will you take it?

15:38.817 --> 15:40.456
We were run out of town last time.

15:40.457 --> 15:43.016
Yeah, but before that,
you were magnificent.

15:43.617 --> 15:46.376
Crowds cheering you to the rafters.

15:46.377 --> 15:48.656
Fists flew.

15:48.657 --> 15:50.496
Men were felled.

15:50.497 --> 15:52.217
Well, I wish I'd seen it.

15:53.897 --> 15:55.177
One more.

16:15.657 --> 16:17.496
You're looking for trade.

16:17.497 --> 16:18.976
Not for myself.

16:18.977 --> 16:21.216
Men say that often.

16:21.217 --> 16:24.896
Then they plunge their
piece down my gullet.

16:24.897 --> 16:26.456
Can you keep that gullet shut?

16:27.257 --> 16:30.296
Our house requires absolute secrecy.

16:33.817 --> 16:37.416
I shall treat your condition
as one would a fever.

16:37.417 --> 16:39.296
By drawing blood?

16:39.297 --> 16:42.456
The fury lies not in your
blood but in your uterus.

16:42.457 --> 16:44.896
That drives your unnatural desires.

16:46.977 --> 16:48.976
What are you doing?

16:48.977 --> 16:52.136
I shall stimulate the location
where the uterine nerves end

16:52.137 --> 16:54.216
thus releasing that troublesome tension.

16:54.217 --> 16:57.216
No, no, no, no!

16:57.217 --> 17:01.737
No! No! No!

17:05.857 --> 17:07.876
A fitting showplace, you'd agree?

17:08.977 --> 17:11.175
What have you got in stock?

17:11.176 --> 17:13.097
We have no time to wait for weavers.

17:14.617 --> 17:18.976
Just yesterday I heard
of a ship gone astray.

17:18.977 --> 17:23.496
They say the call of
sirens could be heard

17:23.497 --> 17:26.236
just before the ocean swallowed it up.

17:27.137 --> 17:30.256
The ship and its cargo of finer silks,

17:31.257 --> 17:32.696
all lost.

17:32.697 --> 17:34.217
How tragic.

17:36.617 --> 17:38.096
If the law makes it upstairs,

17:38.097 --> 17:39.336
don't try and get to the front door.

17:39.337 --> 17:41.616
Get to the servant stairs.

17:41.617 --> 17:45.136
Ma, meet our new boys.

17:45.937 --> 17:48.356
Boys, welcome.

17:49.092 --> 17:51.611
Fredo, you remember Salabat.

17:51.636 --> 17:52.735
Of course.

17:54.177 --> 17:55.936
The kitchen.

17:55.937 --> 17:58.497
There is a cellar that
leads to the street.

18:02.742 --> 18:05.096
So you've hooked him.
Don't let him hook you.

18:05.097 --> 18:07.656
See how he admires the house?

18:07.657 --> 18:10.096
I see your eyes blinking
as wide as your...

18:11.617 --> 18:14.016
Salabat is rich.

18:14.017 --> 18:16.576
We can have everything that
we never dared to dream of.

18:17.577 --> 18:19.576
Remember where we came from.

18:21.537 --> 18:23.796
He said he was going to cure me.

18:24.697 --> 18:28.056
There's no cure. Just his pleasure.

18:28.081 --> 18:30.120
I should have known it.

18:30.297 --> 18:31.497
Are you hurt?

18:32.737 --> 18:33.856
No.

18:34.857 --> 18:36.576
He took care to leave no marks.

18:36.577 --> 18:38.576
He stuck his fat fingers inside me

18:38.577 --> 18:41.616
and named it his most modern physic.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.776
Can't we resist?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.056
This is wrong.

18:48.057 --> 18:50.036
Resist and they will punish you.

18:50.537 --> 18:52.496
What can we do?

18:52.497 --> 18:54.777
We must use his weakness.

18:56.417 --> 18:58.696
His rod will be his ruin.

18:59.897 --> 19:01.536
Always is in the end.

19:08.937 --> 19:10.189
Clothesman.

19:12.017 --> 19:14.416
Lucy. At last.

19:14.417 --> 19:16.416
My sister's house burnt down.

19:16.417 --> 19:17.776
How inconvenient.

19:17.777 --> 19:19.856
The famous Lucy Wells.

19:19.857 --> 19:22.096
Lucy, meet Salabat Ali Khan,

19:22.097 --> 19:24.936
supplier of silks softer
than angel's breath.

19:26.377 --> 19:27.776
Well, haven't you been busy?

19:27.777 --> 19:29.296
We have.

19:29.297 --> 19:31.656
And I've not been sitting in my cradle.

19:31.657 --> 19:34.176
You've got boys and bolts,
and I've got an idea

19:34.177 --> 19:36.207
to bring buyers in for both.

19:40.153 --> 19:41.952
No, no! Don't come in! Don't!

19:41.977 --> 19:43.117
Fucking hell!

19:45.217 --> 19:46.217
No!

19:48.417 --> 19:51.296
The... the duel went bad.

19:51.297 --> 19:53.576
The seconders, they saw
the mess and ran off.

19:53.577 --> 19:55.150
So you brought him home?

19:55.175 --> 19:58.136
Well, I thought the feeble
fellow would pull through!

19:58.137 --> 19:59.416
What are you gonna do with him?

19:59.417 --> 20:00.657
I need him out of here.

20:02.217 --> 20:04.416
- You need help.
- No, no, no!

20:04.417 --> 20:06.176
No one must know.

20:06.177 --> 20:07.809
Trust me.

20:13.857 --> 20:15.416
Christ.

20:33.977 --> 20:36.016
Another eel netted,

20:37.017 --> 20:38.497
another penny in your pouch.

20:41.577 --> 20:44.896
This one tells a tale of woe.

20:44.897 --> 20:48.616
This, his Lord's a fancy foe.

20:48.617 --> 20:51.936
This little boy was took from a sinner.

20:51.937 --> 20:54.697
Now he and his brother
will pay for my dinner.

20:56.297 --> 20:59.776
I didn't dare believe you
were safe till I'd seen it.

21:00.777 --> 21:02.697
Is the Wells house fallen too?

21:05.457 --> 21:07.536
Our world is not as we knew it.

21:08.937 --> 21:10.677
Charlotte won't give in that quick.

21:13.257 --> 21:16.676
We need to know where the
Pinchers keep their gold.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.318
I need to make some.

21:25.377 --> 21:27.576
Give up your secrets.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.876
We hide in barrels in a cellar.

21:31.777 --> 21:36.297
It's dark in there
and cold as the grave.

21:53.577 --> 21:55.656
The law's already watching us.

21:56.657 --> 21:59.256
Chadwick knows how to make money.

21:59.257 --> 22:02.016
He's got contacts. He can help us.

22:02.017 --> 22:03.536
Who's the dead man?

22:04.337 --> 22:06.416
Lord Drummond, an Admiral.

22:06.517 --> 22:08.552
It's risky.

22:10.257 --> 22:14.456
What's life without risk?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.656
Where are they going?

22:40.657 --> 22:42.576
Quick, don't let them out of your sight.

23:03.177 --> 23:04.616
Whose house was this before?

23:05.617 --> 23:07.496
A white-wigged witch.

23:10.961 --> 23:12.840
We need to go. Now.

23:17.057 --> 23:19.076
These men can find
him on their doorstep.

23:19.977 --> 23:21.256
Or he can disappear.

23:21.257 --> 23:23.136
I want him gone.

23:23.137 --> 23:25.176
I... I want this over.

23:34.057 --> 23:35.496
Ready?

23:45.017 --> 23:47.196
Looks better in breeches than I do.

23:47.897 --> 23:49.896
I'm off.

23:49.897 --> 23:52.016
Give me some sign when it's done.

23:52.017 --> 23:53.216
We'll all be looking out for you.

23:59.337 --> 24:01.416
My name is Elizabeth Harvey.

24:03.617 --> 24:06.977
You know my friend, Lucy
Wells, and my son, Fredo.

24:09.457 --> 24:10.956
You're bold to walk in here.

24:11.657 --> 24:14.005
- And what can you do to me?
- Watch your step.

24:14.030 --> 24:16.416
I like whores who lie
with me, not about me.

24:16.417 --> 24:19.096
You burnt my house down.
I don't care what you like.

24:19.097 --> 24:20.522
Why are you really here?

24:21.979 --> 24:23.472
You trying to make me feel bad?

24:23.497 --> 24:26.016
I don't think you feel anything.

24:27.345 --> 24:28.764
Do you?

24:30.537 --> 24:34.656
I feel... everything.

24:36.857 --> 24:41.176
Together we are the Harvey
Wells Tailoring House,

24:41.177 --> 24:45.136
where you will find the
finest silks and brocades.

24:45.137 --> 24:49.256
Where my son has the
measure of every man.

24:51.097 --> 24:52.896
James Croft.

24:52.897 --> 24:54.296
Get him into our cloth.

24:54.297 --> 24:56.096
The town will flock to us.

24:56.097 --> 24:59.336
The silk I'm wearing is
smooth to the touch and ex...

25:08.337 --> 25:11.736
The house known as Quigleys is no more.

25:11.737 --> 25:17.536
We are a reputable establishment
tailoring to all tastes.

25:17.537 --> 25:20.296
To show the quality of our goods,

25:20.297 --> 25:22.256
you can buy the clothes off my back.

25:24.767 --> 25:26.444
What does a girl have to tup around here

25:26.445 --> 25:28.016
to get on the Pinchers' list?

25:34.337 --> 25:36.816
I bid five guineas for the lot.

25:36.817 --> 25:39.856
A good open offer.

25:39.857 --> 25:41.616
You can have the jacket for five.

25:43.297 --> 25:45.736
Another five for your linens?

26:02.937 --> 26:05.136
Emily Lacey,

26:05.137 --> 26:07.496
you are more powerful than I knew.

26:11.977 --> 26:13.456
I can trust your confidence?

26:13.457 --> 26:15.616
You can.

26:33.977 --> 26:36.016
You've done things like that before.

26:36.017 --> 26:38.776
You've seen things like that before.

26:50.257 --> 26:53.096
If you want the secrets
of our craft revealed,

26:53.097 --> 26:55.456
you must pay up.

26:55.457 --> 26:57.256
What do I hear for these fine wares?

26:57.257 --> 26:58.336
Seven guineas!

26:58.337 --> 26:59.656
Eight, eight!

26:59.657 --> 27:00.976
Ten guineas!

27:06.657 --> 27:09.313
Let's see Lucy Wells play Lady Godiva.

27:09.338 --> 27:10.536
Well said, young man!

27:10.537 --> 27:12.352
20 for the lot!

27:12.377 --> 27:15.176
I will if you will.
Show me what you've got.

27:16.697 --> 27:18.176
Well said!

27:26.217 --> 27:28.576
What about you, Hal Pincher?

27:28.577 --> 27:30.256
How much to see what's...

27:36.537 --> 27:38.456
No man is too big for me.

27:56.617 --> 27:58.816
Emily, he may be cock of them all,

27:58.817 --> 28:01.336
but he'd look a lot
better in a new silk coat.

28:03.857 --> 28:07.016
We fit men of all shapes,

28:07.017 --> 28:10.216
whatever your height or build.

28:19.457 --> 28:21.216
I'm sorry.

28:22.937 --> 28:24.776
Me too.

28:27.817 --> 28:30.336
That's your lot, ladies and gentlemen.

28:30.337 --> 28:33.616
All our wares are on
view in Golden Square.

28:33.617 --> 28:35.296
Here she comes.

28:35.297 --> 28:36.976
Did you get it?

28:36.977 --> 28:38.496
Job done.

28:49.977 --> 28:51.736
Fuck!

29:11.875 --> 29:13.434
What a spark.

29:14.737 --> 29:16.976
His prosperity can be yours.

29:18.897 --> 29:20.376
John Kelly.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.747
Ready for your next big fight?

29:24.817 --> 29:27.376
- I've none booked.
- You have now.

29:27.377 --> 29:30.096
That's if you're bold enough

29:30.097 --> 29:32.240
to fight my lad, Jack Lively.

29:33.257 --> 29:35.206
Is that the same Lively
that lost at York?

29:35.457 --> 29:37.936
The same Lively that had
to be dragged from the ring.

29:37.937 --> 29:40.804
He fought before a partisan
crowd and never gave up.

29:41.857 --> 29:43.445
Where do you see this happening?

29:44.577 --> 29:47.096
In some tavern under
the full eyes of the law?

29:47.097 --> 29:48.536
I know how to set up a fight.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.536
I'll find the place.

29:53.897 --> 29:55.416
Well, if you can, I'll be there.

30:06.257 --> 30:08.736
She did it. She got the money.

30:08.737 --> 30:10.656
We did it, Fanny.

30:10.657 --> 30:13.096
Pinchers will learn they
can't fuck with fuckstresses.

30:14.257 --> 30:15.976
Has Kitty eaten? Did she sleep?

30:15.977 --> 30:18.336
I've minded babes before.

30:29.743 --> 30:31.303
- Rani.
- Mr. North.

30:46.137 --> 30:48.591
How dare you look me in
the face and lie to me?

30:48.616 --> 30:49.982
You would have tried to stop me.

30:50.007 --> 30:51.380
I'd have been sure to stop you.

30:51.405 --> 30:54.097
We bit them good and proper.
Mags would have loved it.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.057
Right.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.665
So you did it your way, as always.

31:03.337 --> 31:07.216
Now you got your money and
the Pinchers on your trail.

31:07.217 --> 31:08.737
And where does it lead?

31:11.457 --> 31:12.617
So what are you gonna do?

31:20.817 --> 31:23.856
I could tear Charlotte
Wells's heart from her chest.

31:23.857 --> 31:25.856
So you fucked her?

31:25.857 --> 31:27.976
Seems more like she fucked you.

31:27.977 --> 31:30.377
Why must you always be here?

31:36.079 --> 31:38.296
He's preparing the chair for me again.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.856
How can they come to this
place of their own volition?

31:42.377 --> 31:44.456
Because they know they can leave.

31:46.457 --> 31:48.036
As will we.

31:48.408 --> 31:50.507
We must believe it.

32:00.775 --> 32:02.159
You're afoul.

32:02.184 --> 32:03.623
You aren't welcome here.

32:03.648 --> 32:05.567
Drink somewhere else.

32:05.592 --> 32:06.816
I haven't come to drink.

32:06.817 --> 32:08.576
To gloat?

32:08.577 --> 32:10.181
Charlotte wants to see you.

32:11.341 --> 32:13.280
That trollop doesn't summon us.

32:14.177 --> 32:15.897
She has your money.

32:17.013 --> 32:20.693
If you want to see it again,
you do as she bids.

32:28.137 --> 32:30.736
We're stuffed if she says no.

32:39.137 --> 32:41.136
Isabella, I'm so sorry.

32:42.297 --> 32:44.016
Is there word of Sophia?

32:44.017 --> 32:46.318
I have men trying to find them.

32:48.137 --> 32:49.278
What do you want?

32:54.537 --> 32:56.123
This will end me.

32:56.124 --> 32:59.057
Resist from within and
they cannot hurt you.

33:00.763 --> 33:03.603
Mrs. Quigley, your throne awaits.

33:05.897 --> 33:10.656
Dr. Swinton, I... I
feel the heat building.

33:10.657 --> 33:13.976
It... it's the fury. It quickens.

33:13.977 --> 33:15.856
Miss Bottomley, you
need treatment urgently.

33:15.857 --> 33:18.736
But Dr. Furrow awaits.
There are visitors. Um...

33:18.737 --> 33:21.836
Perhaps I might help.

33:22.937 --> 33:27.336
I could alert Dr. Furrow that he
should take the visitors elsewhere

33:27.337 --> 33:31.216
until you are... finished.

33:31.217 --> 33:32.936
An excellent notion.

33:32.937 --> 33:34.696
Um, go now.

33:34.697 --> 33:36.257
Bid him await my call.

33:50.498 --> 33:52.998
_

33:55.310 --> 33:57.810
_

34:05.577 --> 34:07.061
You know Latin?

34:08.177 --> 34:10.335
I grew up in a white house.

34:10.337 --> 34:11.936
They picked me because when I smiled,

34:11.937 --> 34:13.976
my teeth shone bright in my face.

34:13.976 --> 34:16.936
They dressed me in a turban
and stood me in their salons.

34:16.937 --> 34:19.656
A dolly.

34:19.657 --> 34:21.616
I had a home.

34:21.617 --> 34:23.295
I ate well, learned much.

34:23.297 --> 34:25.295
What did you say to Lord Leadsom?

34:26.379 --> 34:28.896
It's just a friendly
reminder that the walls...

34:28.897 --> 34:31.976
and black men... have ears.

34:40.306 --> 34:41.844
Dr. Furrow.

34:41.870 --> 34:44.589
I bear a missive.

34:44.737 --> 34:48.275
Dr. Swinton asks if you
would bring these good people

34:48.301 --> 34:49.527
to the treatment room.

34:49.553 --> 34:52.072
Miss Bottomley is acutely unwell.

34:52.177 --> 34:54.136
She is in the ice bath.

34:54.137 --> 34:55.676
The doctor has a new method.

34:56.377 --> 34:59.336
One that he's very eager to demonstrate.

34:59.337 --> 35:00.516
Follow me.

35:09.137 --> 35:12.136
The strap contains me.

35:12.137 --> 35:14.976
I can feel no release
whilst I'm restrained.

35:14.977 --> 35:16.816
A wonderful response.

35:34.426 --> 35:38.176
And, here we have the treatment room

35:38.177 --> 35:40.616
where Dr. Swinton is
at this very moment...

35:42.858 --> 35:44.293
Dr. Swinton!

35:44.318 --> 35:46.776
It's acute uterine fury! Her
system is full of madness!

35:48.737 --> 35:50.456
This is your treatment?

35:55.697 --> 35:56.816
What is she doing?

35:58.857 --> 36:00.416
Stop her!

36:00.417 --> 36:01.896
- Escaped!
- They've escaped!

36:01.897 --> 36:03.296
Let's give them a taste of freedom.

36:07.337 --> 36:09.696
Unleash chaos!

36:23.297 --> 36:25.456
Guards!

36:39.578 --> 36:40.856
Guards!

36:40.857 --> 36:42.336
Stop their attack!

36:42.337 --> 36:45.736
They have unleashed delirium and frenzy!

36:58.817 --> 37:00.057
Come here! Come on!

37:17.217 --> 37:18.536
What's this charade?

37:18.537 --> 37:20.216
Where's our money?

37:20.217 --> 37:21.696
What makes you think we have it?

37:22.423 --> 37:24.262
- Give it back.
- Hey.

37:24.537 --> 37:25.916
I'm warning you.

37:25.917 --> 37:27.915
You're warning me and accusing me.

37:27.916 --> 37:30.336
I do hope you have proof.

37:30.337 --> 37:32.416
Don't play this game with me.

37:35.377 --> 37:37.456
Where was I this afternoon?

37:37.457 --> 37:39.083
Here taking tea.

37:40.337 --> 37:43.056
Miss Wells, do you have any witnesses?

37:43.057 --> 37:44.536
A whole room.

37:44.537 --> 37:48.376
This fine lady, I played hazard with.

37:48.377 --> 37:51.056
And this upright gentleman, well,

37:51.057 --> 37:52.136
it wouldn't be polite to say.

37:52.137 --> 37:53.956
- Enough.
- Not yet.

37:55.457 --> 37:58.016
Who opened the doors of my house to you?

37:59.697 --> 38:02.058
None of my men recall doing so.

38:03.297 --> 38:05.056
How did you get in?

38:05.057 --> 38:06.941
You mean they broke in?

38:06.942 --> 38:08.896
Dear.

38:08.897 --> 38:10.696
There's another crime
to add to the list.

38:11.737 --> 38:13.256
Seems your luck's run out.

38:15.417 --> 38:17.376
Here are my terms.

38:17.377 --> 38:20.576
You can have your dirty money,
less what you owe me.

38:20.577 --> 38:24.176
I rebuild my house. You leave this room.

38:24.177 --> 38:26.536
And you never come near me, my girls,

38:26.537 --> 38:28.896
or my family ever again.

38:28.897 --> 38:33.936
Or I will watch and smile
as you swing for your crimes.

38:35.857 --> 38:37.816
Now fly away home.

38:50.857 --> 38:53.136
London is a fearful place.

38:57.697 --> 39:00.176
Not the London we will reside in.

39:04.657 --> 39:07.256
A memento of your triumph.

39:07.257 --> 39:09.017
You lit up that room.

39:18.257 --> 39:20.136
Is it good news?

39:20.137 --> 39:23.256
It is... news.

39:23.257 --> 39:25.177
Sophia is married.

39:26.937 --> 39:28.336
To the footman.

39:29.337 --> 39:32.097
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief.

39:33.737 --> 39:35.393
She says she's happy.

39:35.852 --> 39:38.051
She's in love.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.476
She's rich beyond all our dreams.

39:53.657 --> 39:55.097
I still haven't had my lesson.

40:00.205 --> 40:01.532
Your payment.

40:02.337 --> 40:04.417
I said I want my lesson.

40:05.817 --> 40:09.176
So tell me, how would you grow this?

40:15.257 --> 40:16.777
Have a look at this.

40:25.977 --> 40:29.417
Your silks will be worn by
London's most celestial bodies.

40:31.177 --> 40:33.536
Your body is the only one I care for.

40:37.097 --> 40:38.137
Marry me.

40:39.817 --> 40:41.497
I'm not the marrying kind.

40:44.697 --> 40:48.216
I'll return from Dover bearing treasures

40:48.217 --> 40:50.376
beyond your dreams.

40:50.377 --> 40:52.376
You bring me silks from a fallen ship

40:52.377 --> 40:54.617
and maybe I'll say yes.

41:09.063 --> 41:11.336
Is the master of the house here?

41:11.337 --> 41:13.116
It's the mistress in this household.

41:13.141 --> 41:14.936
How can I help you?

41:14.937 --> 41:17.976
You're beggars. Poor wretches.

41:17.977 --> 41:22.359
N-no, b-but Charles Quigley.

41:23.017 --> 41:25.496
I was told this was his residence.

41:25.497 --> 41:27.256
The debtor?

41:27.257 --> 41:29.296
He was heading to the sponging house.

41:29.297 --> 41:31.896
The bailiffs are high
on his heels, I hear.

41:38.417 --> 41:41.575
Who plays the Queen of my kingdom?

41:43.817 --> 41:46.936
A Wells in my house?

41:46.937 --> 41:49.297
Charles!

41:50.977 --> 41:53.438
What monstrous torture is this?

41:54.457 --> 41:56.352
That's not your house?

41:56.377 --> 41:57.778
It was.

41:59.177 --> 42:02.296
We aren't safe. Where can we go?

42:08.177 --> 42:09.576
There's only one place left.

42:16.217 --> 42:19.487
You don't look as happy as
a man with a pile before him should.

42:20.143 --> 42:21.582
Where's your brother?

42:21.655 --> 42:23.222
I sent him to walk his rage off.

42:27.337 --> 42:31.137
When we met, you told me how
you and Isaac got this place.

42:32.897 --> 42:37.176
A soldier who buys a
barrel of beer at the docks

42:37.177 --> 42:40.506
and sells it to thirsty sailors
is a smart man, I thought.

42:41.737 --> 42:43.200
A man I want to be with.

42:44.457 --> 42:46.017
Look where it got us.

42:48.417 --> 42:50.017
It got you this.

42:52.417 --> 42:56.097
And... got you these.

43:00.297 --> 43:01.659
Where'd those come from?

43:01.684 --> 43:03.660
I told you Chadwick was worth the risk.

43:04.497 --> 43:05.910
You made a friend today.

43:06.897 --> 43:08.722
You can be more than this.

43:09.977 --> 43:12.816
You turned a barrel into 20.

43:12.817 --> 43:14.056
And we're gonna do it again.

43:15.657 --> 43:18.136
Bigger and better than you ever dreamed.

43:19.017 --> 43:20.657
How do you reckon to do that?

43:25.057 --> 43:26.256
America.

43:27.257 --> 43:28.657
There's land for sale.

43:35.297 --> 43:36.897
May we come in?

43:38.697 --> 43:41.057
You have been freed?

43:43.457 --> 43:45.576
Will you give us shelter?

43:47.097 --> 43:48.780
Charles is gone.

43:49.356 --> 43:52.635
A woman in his place
and a Wells in my house.

43:52.660 --> 43:56.299
Ooh, a woman in your house, you say?

43:56.324 --> 43:58.856
Arrogant, full of grandeur,

43:58.857 --> 44:02.096
and a most self-satisfied expression.

44:02.097 --> 44:04.212
I've no idea who it could be.

44:05.577 --> 44:06.747
Please.

44:08.057 --> 44:09.296
Can we come in?

44:11.657 --> 44:15.496
As you are in such dire straits...

44:26.457 --> 44:28.656
You make a beautiful boy.

44:28.657 --> 44:30.216
Shame you don't have the equipment.

44:31.629 --> 44:34.176
I like jewels around my neck,
not between my legs.

44:35.301 --> 44:37.656
Little peacock spreading
your tail feathers.

44:37.657 --> 44:38.936
You weren't just showing off our wares.

44:38.937 --> 44:40.550
What were you really up to?

44:41.737 --> 44:44.296
My sister had a score
to settle in the tavern.

44:44.297 --> 44:46.216
And we made the diversion.

44:46.217 --> 44:48.157
What had the tavern done to her?

44:48.182 --> 44:49.742
Burnt her house down.

44:53.577 --> 44:54.976
I've been asked to be married.

44:54.977 --> 44:57.096
Mama, what surprising news.

44:57.097 --> 44:59.954
Let's celebrate. I propose a game.

45:00.617 --> 45:01.736
You make three statements.

45:01.737 --> 45:03.496
I must decide which is a lie.

45:07.297 --> 45:12.056
My ma sold my maidenhead
for 50 pounds, twice.

45:13.577 --> 45:16.337
My ma was hanged for murder.

45:18.217 --> 45:20.537
And my pa is a black man.

45:21.708 --> 45:22.947
Now you.

45:25.594 --> 45:27.130
I am a spinster.

45:28.217 --> 45:29.576
My son is a changeling.

45:30.697 --> 45:31.776
I am a widow.

45:38.617 --> 45:40.737
Didn't you get your fill outside?

46:37.697 --> 46:39.616
You win.
