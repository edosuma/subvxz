They were 13-year-old geeks
at band camp.

Okay, first of all,
it was a songwriter's workshop.

03:20.433 --> 03:23.425
And, uh, Billy wasn't a geek.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.938
He was just a little skinny.
He had a little acne on the face.

03:26.005 --> 03:29.134
- And braces.
- We all had braces.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.871

27:53.570 --> 27:55.902
-I do.
- How can I help?

27:55.972 --> 27:58.566
- Be patient with me.
- Always.

27:58.642 --> 28:01.737
- Don't say it like that, like I'm a kid.
- That's not what I meant.

28:01.812 --> 28:05.510
What are you worried about?
Really? What can I do?

28:05.582 --> 28:09.416
Tell your friend to leave.
He shouldn't be here. It's not a good time.

28:11.621 --> 28:13.953
Not a good time?

28:14.958 --> 28:17.325
Let me ask you a question, Michael.

28:17.394 --> 28:19.624
- Here we go.
- No, don't do that.

28:19.696 --> 28:21.790
You asked “What can I do?“
and I tell you.

28:21.865 --> 28:24.527
- When is it a good time?
- To step out with an old boyfriend?

28:24.601 --> 28:28.333
- He is not an old- Would you just-
- Where's your patience now?

28:28.405 --> 28:33.707
When is it a good time for me to take a small step
back from this nonstop alien hootenanny?

28:33.777 --> 28:36.144
- We're in danger. Max's father--
- I know!

28:36.213 --> 28:39.239
- And you don't care because of that Billy guy!
- [Rumbling]

28:45.255 --> 28:49.158
- Michael.
- You're gonna leave me for him.

28:50.293 --> 28:52.819
No. No.

28:57.801 --> 29:00.930
Okay, I'll tell him.

29:02.105 --> 29:06.235
- Thank you.
- Hey, it's what I do.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.437
It's what I always do.

29:13.750 --> 29:16.481
<i>Max? I think we got a problem.</i>

29:16.553 --> 29:20.751
- What is it?
- Your dad just called for a tow truck.

29:20.824 --> 29:22.758
Where?

29:22.826 --> 29:26.626
At mile marker 16
out on Route 7.

29:26.696 --> 29:28.721
They found thejeep.

29:32.369 --> 29:35.634

- H6)!-

29:37.174 --> 29:40.508
<i>- I have to tell you something.
- What?</i>

29:40.577 --> 29:42.602
[Sighs]

29:42.679 --> 29:44.613
You have to go.

29:44.681 --> 29:47.343
Right this second?

29:47.417 --> 29:49.852
Yeah.

29:52.088 --> 29:54.056
I'll get my stuff.

30:03.667 --> 30:06.802
Is this about Michael? I mean,
am I in the middle of something?

30:06.803 --> 30:06.826
Is this about Michael? I mean,
am I in the middle of something?

30:06.936 --> 30:08.836
No, it's- it's complicated.

30:08.905 --> 30:11.840
It'sjust my life. I can't have
more than one thing going on.

30:11.908 --> 30:15.572
<i>It's not you.
It has nothing to do with you.</i>

30:15.645 --> 30:17.579
That's too bad.

30:20.116 --> 30:22.050
What's that supposed to mean?

30:22.118 --> 30:24.143
Truth?

30:28.391 --> 30:30.883
Maria, I missed my bus
on purpose.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.329
Why?

30:34.397 --> 30:37.697
'Cause I was given
some advice one time.

30:37.767 --> 30:40.065
“Decide what you want in life,
and live it.“

30:40.136 --> 30:43.663
- That's terrible advice.
- You gave it to me.

30:43.739 --> 30:47.141
- Well, that explains it.
- Fouryears ago, our last night at camp.

30:47.210 --> 30:49.269
I was 13.

30:49.345 --> 30:53.213
Well, you know what? That night
stuck with me. You stuck with me.

30:53.282 --> 30:56.252
- [ Exhales ]
- <i>That kiss stuck with me.</i>

30:56.319 --> 30:59.380
<i>It was my first one.</i>

30:59.455 --> 31:03.517
- You told me that you'd kissed tons of girls.
- I lied.

31:05.294 --> 31:07.524
[Sighs]
I don't know.

31:09.198 --> 31:10.893
I was just--

31:10.967 --> 31:14.096
- I was hoping that-
- I'm with someone.

31:15.705 --> 31:17.639
Yeah, I met him.

31:17.707 --> 31:21.769
- Look, you don't understand. Michael isjust-
- Stopping you?

31:21.844 --> 31:24.142
- Stopping me? From what?
- From I don't know.

31:24.213 --> 31:27.046
From- From life.

31:28.784 --> 31:31.310
From this.

31:54.744 --> 31:57.270
This is bad.

31:57.346 --> 31:59.212
What are you gonna
tell your father, Max?

31:59.282 --> 32:01.478
I'm not gonna tell him anything.
He doesn't trust me anymore.

32:01.550 --> 32:03.678
Who does he trust?

32:16.766 --> 32:20.134
- And then you kissed him?
- Yes, I did.

32:20.202 --> 32:23.263
- Where is he right now?
- At my house.

32:24.307 --> 32:26.799
[Chuckles]
What were you thinking?

32:26.876 --> 32:28.810
I don't know.

32:28.878 --> 32:31.404
- And that's all that it was? It was just a kiss?
- Maybe.

32:31.480 --> 32:35.781
You know. Maybe not.

32:35.851 --> 32:38.752
Let's talk about the kiss for one second.
Was there any passion?

32:39.989 --> 32:42.720
- Tons.
- Oh.

32:42.792 --> 32:46.353
I know. But it's not
that kind of passion.

32:46.429 --> 32:48.864
It was like it woke me up.

32:49.932 --> 32:53.232
- Like Sleeping Beauty.
- Yeah, I guess.

32:53.302 --> 32:56.567
Do you think I've been asleep
this whole time?

32:56.639 --> 32:59.506
Well, yeah, I think that
you've been trying to remember...

32:59.575 --> 33:02.510
who you used to be
for a long time.

33:04.313 --> 33:06.304
[Groans]

33:07.350 --> 33:10.513
- Say it.
- lfsjust...

33:10.586 --> 33:14.489
sometimes I just feel like I've paid
this huge price for knowing Michael...

33:14.557 --> 33:16.491
and knowing these aliens.

33:16.559 --> 33:22.362
It's like, God, I didn't think I'd end up here
dealing with this crap every day.

33:22.431 --> 33:26.095
I mean, I love Michael, and I do
sort of love this ridiculous soap opera...

33:26.168 --> 33:30.071
but I just-
I can't take it anymore.

33:30.139 --> 33:33.632
I feel like I'm trapped
and I'm never gonna get out.

33:33.709 --> 33:35.803
I know.

33:35.878 --> 33:40.577
I mean,
I didn't sign up for this.

33:40.649 --> 33:43.311
Yes,you did. We all did.

33:43.386 --> 33:46.686
I know. lt'sjust
I had this dream once.

33:46.756 --> 33:50.124
I mean, maybe I still do.
I don't know.

33:50.192 --> 33:54.060
Well, maybe sometimes
you have to go after your dreams.

33:54.130 --> 33:56.155
But who am I to tell you
to just give them up?

33:56.232 --> 34:00.100
- Because without your dreams you'rejust me.
- Liz.

34:01.537 --> 34:04.563
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That sounded way too self-pitying.

34:04.640 --> 34:08.804
And this isn't about me.
It's just that, um...

34:08.878 --> 34:11.370
you know I'm committed
to going down this road with Max.

34:11.447 --> 34:14.643
- Good, bad, indifferent, I'm committed.
- Mm-hmm.

34:14.717 --> 34:17.049
And I've given up a lot along the way.
So unless you're sure...

34:17.119 --> 34:21.851
that's what you wanna do with Michael,
don't be so quick to give up your dreams.

34:35.471 --> 34:40.170
- Hey. I had this insane idea.
- What?

34:40.242 --> 34:44.371
That we do what we planned.
That I go to New York with you.

34:44.447 --> 34:48.179
- Wow.
- Yeah.

34:48.250 --> 34:50.184
What about your mom?

34:50.252 --> 34:53.688
Well, I know that she'll want me
to finish high school.

34:53.755 --> 34:56.918
- Not a bad idea.
- No, so after I graduate.

34:56.992 --> 34:59.859
- Great.
- Maybe.

34:59.929 --> 35:03.263
- Maybe.
- I just don't know if this is want I wanna do-

35:03.332 --> 35:07.633
Hey, hey, hey, you don't owe me
an explanation. I screwed things up.

35:07.703 --> 35:10.263
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

35:10.339 --> 35:14.003
I should've known better.
I changed the whole flow between us.

35:14.076 --> 35:17.740
But I've been wanting to kiss you
for about four years...

35:17.813 --> 35:20.942
and I'm a guy,
sol took a shot.

35:21.016 --> 35:23.644
- I think I may have given you the
wrong impression. - No, you didn't.

35:23.719 --> 35:29.158
We're fine. And if I did anything
to make you feel bad, I'm sorry.

35:31.427 --> 35:34.294
I just wish you hadn't--

35:34.363 --> 35:36.297
What?

35:39.201 --> 35:42.796
I wish you hadn't have hidden yourself
away with that guitar.

35:56.118 --> 35:59.053
You gonna come see me
in the Village?

35:59.121 --> 36:01.112
Yes.

36:01.190 --> 36:03.215
I'll get you front-row seats.

36:03.292 --> 36:06.956
And I will throw
my underwear atyou.

36:11.066 --> 36:12.966
Good-bye, Maria.

36:13.035 --> 36:15.834
Good-bye.

It's newly upholstered. It has a dark print
with big, pink cabbage roses.

36:33.923 --> 36:37.587

- Hey, hey, hey. You can't beat the price.

<i>[ Max's Voice]

<i>- They would never do that.

36:51.674 --> 36:56.236

- <i>You're wrong, Max.</i>

36:56.312 --> 36:58.804

- The truth.</i>

36:58.881 --> 37:01.043
- <i>[Diane] What, hon?</i>
- What?

37:01.116 --> 37:03.915

37:06.021 --> 37:08.319
The truth. I--

37:08.390 --> 37:11.758
I wanna tell you the truth about
what's been going on with Max.

37:13.629 --> 37:15.620
It's about Tess.

37:16.799 --> 37:18.733
Max got Tess pregnant.

37:18.801 --> 37:21.736
<i>But she left before
the baby was born.</i>

37:21.804 --> 37:25.934
- So Max may have a child out there somewhere.
- Oh, my.

37:26.008 --> 37:28.807
<i>The night that she left, he was so angry
that he just drove all night...</i>

37:28.877 --> 37:32.871

I wouldn't have-

He was just so afraid to disappoint you.

Thank you for finally
telling us the truth.
