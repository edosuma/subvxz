00:44.617 --> 00:47.052
Hopefully to advance to next

Deeply emotional song choice by
team gwen's passionate pop

01:00.566 --> 01:07.472

01:07.607 --> 01:13.378
Now from jeffrey austin.
¶ i'm jealous of the rain

>> you're a good singer.
>> thank you.

01:17.583 --> 01:19.084

know this song.

>> no.
>> it's so beautiful, so

01:22.822 --> 01:25.090
Emotional.
And a perfect platform to show

01:25.224 --> 01:29.327
Case your incredible singing.
>> i think it shows me a little

01:29.462 --> 01:31.363
Bit more vulnerable, especially
with the instrumentation.

01:31.497 --> 01:33.832
>> that's so important right
now.

01:33.966 --> 01:35.901
I want you to be super open.
>> yeah.

01:36.035 --> 01:40.806
It's very strange that only
months ago i was at a desk doing

01:40.940 --> 01:42.207
Public relations and now here i
am.

01:42.341 --> 01:45.577
People i have never met before
or talked to are coming to the

01:45.712 --> 01:50.315
Show, screaming your name and
they're so excited to meet you.

01:50.450 --> 01:53.085
It makes me excited to do the
next thing.

01:53.219 --> 01:55.687
I think it's one of the most
beautiful songs i have ever

01:55.822 --> 01:57.823
Heard.
Really good.

01:57.957 --> 02:01.026
I'm excited about it.
>> style-wise, i'd love you in a

02:01.160 --> 02:03.128
Suit.
This is, like, formal.

02:03.262 --> 02:05.864
More than we have done.
Like all the way.

02:05.998 --> 02:08.166
Black tie, white shirt.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.870
All.
>> you have come so far.

02:12.004 --> 02:14.639
Being believable, let your body
be relaxed.

02:14.774 --> 02:17.075
What would happen if you lost
control?

02:17.210 --> 02:19.845
You need to ask yourself that.
>> yeah.

02:19.979 --> 02:23.248
The lyrics are specific.
Watching someone from a past

02:23.382 --> 02:25.684
Relationship move on and find
someone new in their lives.

02:25.818 --> 02:29.154
There is a balance you have to
find of being completely open

02:29.288 --> 02:34.593
Emotionally and still
maintaining the music side.

02:34.727 --> 02:39.765
¶ closer than your shadow ¶
>> it's so cool to have the

02:39.899 --> 02:46.471
People rally for you.
In my hometown, st. Charles,

02:46.606 --> 02:49.574
Illinois, they make cakes with
my face on it.

02:49.709 --> 02:57.315
Cashiers wear t-shirts for me.
I'm excited to take it to the

02:57.450 --> 03:00.519
Next level.

Of the wind ¶

You'd come back ¶
¶ tell me

04:15.094 --> 04:23.435
All you found was
heartbreak and misery

¶ i'm jealous of the way

You're happy without me
i'm jealous of the nights

04:40.353 --> 04:49.494

Entire season than i have that
performance for some reason,

first time hearing those lyrics

And, like, feeling your honesty
and the comfort you have right

08:02.188 --> 08:05.323
Now is just a major achievement.
A lot of people sing songs.

08:05.458 --> 08:09.627
You don't know who they are.
For the first time i feel like

08:09.762 --> 08:12.297

I was transported to this place,
this space.

08:26.979 --> 08:30.181
It was so beautiful.
We struggled with trying to find

08:30.316 --> 08:32.984
A song.
I feel like that was just per

08:33.119 --> 08:35.919
Effect.

10:02.441 --> 10:06.177
Performance was that you were
doing something so grassroots.

10:06.312 --> 10:08.780
Don't let anyone tell you who
you are.

10:08.914 --> 10:14.419

10:48.654 --> 10:50.655
Number one song in country on
itunes.

10:50.789 --> 10:55.293
The fact that she's 17 but
already has a grip on her

10:55.427 --> 10:58.196
Artistry, i can't tell you how
far that puts her ahead in

10:58.330 --> 11:00.965

Lik

15:42.848 --> 15:44.782
Likewise, talented and focused
beyond your years.

15:44.917 --> 15:48.052
That could have been somebody
from 20, 30 years ago.

15:48.186 --> 15:51.122
The fact that it's in a
17-year-old girl is impressive.

15:51.256 --> 15:55.626
Congratulations.

>> that was amazing.
I think that what's really cool

To see is, like, you were a good
singer when you started the

16:04.970 --> 16:08.573
Show.
Now you're a phenomenal singer.

16:08.707 --> 16:11.809
That, to me, just seeing that
amount of growth in a short

16:11.944 --> 16:16.314

about the sent mental value of

32:27.852 --> 32:29.753
The song.
So i know you're thinking about

32:29.887 --> 32:32.756
It now.
Let's talk to pharrell.

32:32.890 --> 32:39.062
What do you think of that?
>> man, i don't know if it was

32:39.196 --> 32:43.199
Talked about the value of the
song and what it meant to you,

32:43.334 --> 32:46.303
But something tells me it was
literally just the way you

32:46.437 --> 32:49.906
Performed it.
I think this was honestly your

32:50.041 --> 32:54.377
Best performance.
I feel like.

32:54.512 --> 32:58.715
>> thank you.
>> it's like you connected to

32:58.849 --> 33:01.918
The intention of the person who
wrote that song like for

33:02.053 --> 33:04.654
Whatever.
I know this meant something to

33:04.789 --> 33:06.923
You in terms of your
grandfather.

33:07.058 --> 33:09.726
But i feel like what you sang in
here tonight and the way you

33:09.860 --> 33:13.229
Connected to the lyrics, i feel
like everybody in here could

33:13.364 --> 33:15.565

moment on this show.

As your coach i have been trying
to get you out of your own way

talent that you have to sing.

The whole crew there for the
vachal family enjoying that.

47:22.279 --> 47:24.113
Gwen stefani what do you think?
>> i was fantasizing about the

47:24.247 --> 47:27.416
Tour after this.
Take a bunch of top songs, flip

47:27.551 --> 47:30.653
Them.
Everybody wants to see that.

47:30.787 --> 47:35.658
Just do a theater tour and maybe
one or two of your own covers,

47:35.792 --> 47:37.460
Whatever.
Make up some songs.

47:37.594 --> 47:41.530
Who wouldn't go to that?
You're set up.

47:41.665 --> 47:45.768
You can go on tour.
It's perfect.

47:45.902 --> 47:49.004
>> carson: Adam?
>> i want to talk to you.

47:49.139 --> 47:52.641
This is cool.
What we figured out together is

47:52.776 --> 47:55.177
The ability to maximize the
creative capacity you can have

47:55.312 --> 47:59.815
On the show with songs that are
not your own.

47:59.950 --> 48:02.785
For anyone that's writing songs,
singing songs.

48:02.919 --> 48:05.454
I think that with you, amy, we
have been able to really

48:05.589 --> 48:07.990
Maximize that and show people
that there are a million

48:08.124 --> 48:10.493
Different ways a great song can
be a great song and you're so

48:10.627 --> 48:14.163
Good at it.
The way you sing them , approach

48:14.297 --> 48:20.636
Them and the arrangements.
They are also just a really good

48:20.770 --> 48:23.873
Kind of display of artistry.
That should be commended and re

48:24.007 --> 48:25.074
Warded and you guys should vote
for this girl.

48:25.208 --> 48:32.781

And barrett baber.

49:02.145 --> 49:06.549

Don't forget, if your favorite

49:06.683 --> 49:08.083
Artist's song is in the top
10 of the itunes singles chart

49:08.218 --> 49:09.418
At the close of voting, their
itunes downloads will be

49:09.553 --> 49:10.986
Multiplied by 10.
And that could help them win it

49:11.121 --> 49:14.156
All.
Continuing now with team adam's

49:14.291 --> 49:16.625
Pop singer who's taking on one

Of all time at a crucial point
in the competition.

Everyone has been so supportive.
It's been so overwhelming.

49:38.882 --> 49:42.318
This is a big week for me.
Top 10 is a huge deal.

49:42.452 --> 49:46.155
It will require a lot of hard
work, focus and making sure i'm

49:46.289 --> 49:49.491
Doing the songs justice.
>> hope you're ready, adam.

49:49.626 --> 49:51.293
>> you have broken the top 10
itunes every week.

49:51.428 --> 49:54.697
>> no pressure, right?
>> have i led you wrong yet,

49:54.831 --> 49:56.265
Pal?
>> you have not.

¶ hallelujah ¶

50:05.041 --> 50:09.645
>> in your moment s of joy
you're like, hallelujah.

50:09.779 --> 50:13.382
But in moment s of sadness it
ace's

50:13.516 --> 50:15.117
Like, i have to hold on to that
great thing.

50:15.251 --> 50:18.153
>> unbelievable.
To me, this is the best way to

50:18.288 --> 50:21.790
Bridge yourself to the end.
I want you to have the right

50:21.925 --> 50:25.094
Alaska.
>> -- arc.

50:25.228 --> 50:27.896
>> i have to feel the connection
with everyone.

50:28.031 --> 50:35.004
What if we had a violin or a
solo cello?

50:35.138 --> 50:36.005
>> there's a choral feeling to
it.

50:36.139 --> 50:40.209
Haunting.
The song needs to start small,

50:40.343 --> 50:46.448
Grow and get big.
That's the key for this one.

50:46.583 --> 50:49.251
I think jordan can do anything.
He can cause people to feel and

50:49.386 --> 50:57.860
Emote with him.
He's spectacular.

50:57.994 --> 51:01.263

That david played
and it pleased the lord ¶

51:31.127 --> 51:34.363
¶ but you don't really care
for music, do you?

51:34.497 --> 51:40.235
It goes like this
the fourth, the fifth ¶

51:40.370 --> 51:45.708
¶ the minor fall
the major lift

51:45.842 --> 51:51.647

but you needed proof

52:20.777 --> 52:26.982
You saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight ¶

52:27.117 --> 52:31.587
¶ overthrew you
she tied you to a kitchen chair

52:31.721 --> 52:38.627
She broke your throne
and she cut your hair ¶

¶ i've seen this room

53:13.096 --> 53:19.735
And i've walked this floor
i used to live alone

53:19.869 --> 53:25.941
Before i knew you ¶
¶ i've seen your flag

53:26.075 --> 53:28.443
On the marble arch
love is not

53:28.578 --> 53:33.215
A victory march ¶
¶ it's a cold

However, it is the top 10.

54:29.639 --> 54:43.018
That's jordan smith from team
adam.

54:43.152 --> 54:48.423
[ cheers and applause ]
>> carson: Well, it all seems a

54:48.558 --> 54:52.261
Familiar environment in this
room when this young man sings.

54:52.395 --> 54:53.996
Let's get comments from the
coaches.

54:54.130 --> 54:57.733
Let's start with you, blake.
>> hi, jordan.

54:57.867 --> 55:00.269
Man, it gets kind of boring
talking to jordan after his

55:00.403 --> 55:02.271
Performances because we say the
same stuff.

55:02.405 --> 55:04.506
It's incredible.
It's over the top.

55:04.641 --> 55:08.844
That's no different, man.
Every time you get on stage.

55:08.978 --> 55:12.247
There was a guy, matthew schuler
who did that song a few seasons

55:12.382 --> 55:14.349
Ago, man.
I thought nobody could ever top

55:14.484 --> 55:18.220
That version.
I think you just did, man.

55:18.354 --> 55:22.090
Great job, buddy.
>> carson: Pharrell?

55:22.225 --> 55:28.297
>> thank you so much.
>> i agree with blake.

55:28.431 --> 55:31.366
It's not much you can do to
compliment what you have just

55:31.501 --> 55:34.136
Done and have it match what you
have done.

55:34.270 --> 55:38.774
I mean, the only word that comes
to mind for me is effortless.

55:38.908 --> 55:43.946
It's very effortless the way
that you skate through the

55:44.080 --> 55:48.850
Scales.
When you sing like that it's

55:48.985 --> 55:50.085
Incredibly like -- touching.
Congratulations.

55:50.219 --> 55:54.690
[ cheers and applause ]
>> carson: Thank you, pharrell.

55:54.824 --> 55:58.293
Jordan, your coach is adam.
Adam, what do you think?

55:58.428 --> 56:02.431

version of this that i was

56:02.565 --> 56:04.800

today.

56:04.934 --> 56:09.137
Every time i watched it or
showed somebody how amazing it

56:09.272 --> 56:12.240
Was, i would get literally
chills.

56:12.375 --> 56:16.545
What you do, to me, is just
so -- from the moment i met you,

56:16.679 --> 56:17.646
I said it's important what you
do.

56:17.780 --> 56:20.115
You lift people.
You lift me .

56:20.249 --> 56:24.753
Every time i hear you sing it's
an experience.

56:24.887 --> 56:28.690
That doesn't happen.
You are truly above and beyond

56:28.825 --> 56:32.928
What i could ever ask for on
this show and beyond, man.

56:33.062 --> 56:34.029
You really astonish me every
single day.

56:34.163 --> 56:36.832

I recorded my own version when i
was 13 years old.

From early on i got a guitar,
started song-writing.

01:10:52.254 --> 01:10:55.156
Getting to share my artistry
with pharrell.

01:10:55.290 --> 01:10:59.293
I would be lucky if this is what
life is like.

01:10:59.428 --> 01:11:02.997
I feel the long lended itself to
be a sad song.

01:11:03.131 --> 01:11:04.966
It's about people keeping girls
down a little bit.

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:11.205
>> i love it.
You're singing for girl power.

01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:16.143

The power notes will be
important.

01:11:18.647 --> 01:11:22.083

>> musically, i think it should
stay stripped down until the

01:11:32.761 --> 01:11:35.997
Third verse.
There was something magical

01:11:36.131 --> 01:11:38.199
About strings, piano and her
voice.

01:11:38.333 --> 01:11:41.202
Madi is the only one like
herself in the competition.

01:11:41.336 --> 01:11:43.938
If she didn't make it through my
team is done for the season.

01:11:44.072 --> 01:11:46.574
This is not about me.
This is a 16-year-old girl

01:11:46.708 --> 01:11:49.577
Living out her dream.
Do what you do.
