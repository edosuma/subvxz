00:44.911 --> 00:47.613
Twill Ongenbone.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.518
It's just you?!
Where is everybody?!

00:52.552 --> 00:55.854
They said they wanted to come,
but they couldn't

00:55.889 --> 00:58.528
because...
they didn't <i>want</i> to come.

00:58.897 --> 01:00.047
Where were you?!

01:00.081 --> 01:02.032
This was a really big deal for me.

01:02.066 --> 01:04.284
I got a Master's in
Archeology from Georgetown!

01:04.318 --> 01:06.119
You didn't even go to school there.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.571
Yeah, you transferred all your credits

01:07.605 --> 01:10.323
from a fake school in Nairobi
where you're also the dean,

01:10.341 --> 01:13.877
and his arch nemesis, fraternity
prankster, Machmud Thikbooti.

01:13.912 --> 01:15.112
So?

01:15.146 --> 01:17.231
So you don't really have
a degree in archeology.

01:17.265 --> 01:18.398
You're a fraud.

01:18.433 --> 01:20.050
How can you say that to someone

01:20.084 --> 01:22.019
the world has recognized in so many ways?

01:22.053 --> 01:23.220
I have an Oscar!

01:23.254 --> 01:25.088
That's Cuba Gooding's Oscar.

01:25.123 --> 01:26.540
You just bought it on eBay.

01:26.574 --> 01:28.575
Nuh-uh. I bought it,
<i>and</i> left feedback.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.010
Not enough people do.

01:30.044 --> 01:33.513
What Stan's saying is
that an Oscar, like a degree,

01:33.548 --> 01:36.733
is an achievement
people work really hard for.

01:36.768 --> 01:39.803
Mr. Gooding was awarded that
for his excellence in acting.

01:39.837 --> 01:41.321
Sure, he made some bad choices

01:41.356 --> 01:43.123
after the film <i>Show Me the Money,</i>

01:43.157 --> 01:45.125
but that Oscar is his and not yours.

01:45.159 --> 01:47.060
And nothing you do
in your miserable life

01:47.095 --> 01:49.029
will <i>ever</i> come close to what he did.

01:49.063 --> 01:50.180
(Klaus panting)

01:50.214 --> 01:51.365
I heard shouting.

01:51.399 --> 01:52.950
Is everything okay?

01:52.984 --> 01:54.751
There! Are you
happy now?!

01:54.786 --> 01:56.420
(sobbing)

01:56.454 --> 01:59.222
Did you have to be so hard on him?

01:59.257 --> 02:01.291
He was pretending to be the recipient

02:01.326 --> 02:04.061
of the highest honor awarded
in the world of acting.

02:04.095 --> 02:05.429
I know, but it's just...

02:05.463 --> 02:06.647
It's just what, Francine?

02:06.681 --> 02:08.782
He was making out like he won an Oscar.

02:08.816 --> 02:10.317
You're right.

02:10.351 --> 02:14.221
It's an Oscar, for God's sake.

02:14.255 --> 02:16.323
(sniffling)

02:16.357 --> 02:19.059
Why doesn't anyone like my awards?

02:19.093 --> 02:22.529
Well, sweetheart, because
you didn't earn them.

02:22.563 --> 02:23.964
Like this one.

02:23.998 --> 02:26.466
You're supposed to get this
for being good at bowling.

02:26.501 --> 02:28.435
Are you good at bowling?

02:28.469 --> 02:29.836
Bowling's gross.

02:29.871 --> 02:31.905
So this is just a hunk of plastic.

02:31.939 --> 02:33.473
All this stuff is.

02:33.508 --> 02:35.809
I'm sorry, Roger, but
you're taking praise

02:35.843 --> 02:37.811
for things you haven't earned.

02:37.845 --> 02:39.413
But I could earn things.

02:39.447 --> 02:41.348
I could work hard if I wanted.

02:41.382 --> 02:42.816
I know.

02:42.850 --> 02:45.052
You've got great stuff in there.

02:45.086 --> 02:47.788
You just have to apply yourself.

02:47.822 --> 02:49.923
You believe in me!

02:49.957 --> 02:51.291
(musical trilling)

02:51.326 --> 02:53.860
Oh, my God, you can do that?

02:53.895 --> 02:56.930
Yeah, when I'm really happy.

02:56.964 --> 02:58.332
(musical trilling) Ew!

02:58.366 --> 03:00.150
Yeah, it's made
out of pee-pee.

03:00.184 --> 03:02.652
(crickets chirring)

03:02.687 --> 03:04.888
Hey, Dad.
Hmm.

03:04.922 --> 03:07.474
So, Dad, Mr. Brink
gave us an assignment.

03:07.508 --> 03:09.943
We're supposed to interview our dads.

03:09.977 --> 03:11.945
It's-it's supposed
to show us

03:11.979 --> 03:13.580
that history can come from anywhere.

03:13.614 --> 03:15.549
What?

03:15.583 --> 03:17.718
I'm just supposed to ask
some background questions,

03:17.752 --> 03:19.319
you know... (laughs)
about your life.

03:19.354 --> 03:20.754
Like, where were you born?

03:20.788 --> 03:22.189
That's getting awfully personal.

03:22.223 --> 03:25.092
What?! But-but how am I
gonna do my assignment?

03:25.126 --> 03:26.727
Maybe you don't do this one.

03:26.761 --> 03:28.528
It's high school, Steve.

03:28.563 --> 03:29.696
It doesn't matter.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.298
You said that about middle school.

03:31.332 --> 03:32.766
When's it start to matter?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.234
Never.
Never.

03:36.104 --> 03:38.355
(music plays on TV)

03:38.389 --> 03:40.507
Check it out, guys.

03:40.541 --> 03:42.976
I'm training for the
Langley Falls marathon.

03:43.010 --> 03:45.479
Whoa, that's a big deal,
running a marathon.

03:45.513 --> 03:46.897
You're not running any marathon.

03:46.931 --> 03:48.265
Am, too!

03:48.299 --> 03:50.467
Francine explained how
when you work for something,

03:50.501 --> 03:51.768
it's more valuable.

03:51.803 --> 03:54.404
If I finish this marathon,
I <i>earn</i> a medal.

03:54.439 --> 03:56.706
You're a fatso, and you couldn't
run four blocks.

03:56.741 --> 03:58.375
Stan...It's true.
What?

03:58.409 --> 04:00.310
His legs are shorter than his feet.

04:00.344 --> 04:02.179
Ugh! Roger,
don't listen to him.

04:02.213 --> 04:04.481
Let your actions speak for themselves.

04:04.515 --> 04:05.949
Like when you get drunk tonight

04:05.983 --> 04:08.618
and eat all the fruit leather
which you claim to hate.

04:08.653 --> 04:10.554
I do hate it!
Where is it?

04:10.588 --> 04:12.656
Not for you.
You're in training.

04:12.690 --> 04:14.624
And I'm gonna help you.

I'm gonna fail 'cause my

five years ago and never came back.

STEVE:
Hey, Dad. What-what you up to?

05:15.236 --> 05:18.071
Eating lunch. I just needed
a break from work, you know?

05:18.105 --> 05:21.208
Lately, I've been thinking about
all the people I've had to kill.

05:21.242 --> 05:25.028
God. The first five, ten times
you take a life, it's eerie.

05:25.062 --> 05:26.530
You remember every detail.

05:26.564 --> 05:28.131
I can see all their faces.

05:28.166 --> 05:29.332
One had a beard.

05:29.367 --> 05:30.800
Each time I pulled the trigger,

05:30.835 --> 05:32.769
I tied a little knot in my memory

05:32.803 --> 05:34.638
that no amount of whiskey could loosen.

05:34.672 --> 05:36.173
'Course eventually, I stopped caring.

05:36.207 --> 05:38.608
Now I can put a bullet
through a man's head

05:38.643 --> 05:41.711
while figuring out how much KFC
to pick up on my way home.

05:41.746 --> 05:43.480
It's usually no more than a bucket.

05:43.514 --> 05:45.882
The sick part is,
I've come to love it--

05:45.917 --> 05:47.184
snuffing out lives.

05:47.218 --> 05:48.552
I crave it.

05:48.586 --> 05:50.654
I feel like an angel of death.

05:50.688 --> 05:53.173
The Messenger of Eternal Darkness.

05:53.207 --> 05:55.292
A merciless demon
with an unquenchable...

05:55.326 --> 05:57.827
Oh, they just put more
orange chicken in the buffet.

05:57.879 --> 06:00.780
Got to run.
(dial tone)

06:04.936 --> 06:07.204
Remember, the goal is to finish.

06:07.238 --> 06:09.289
Ha! I'm gonna win this thing.

06:09.323 --> 06:11.424
Everybody looks so slow!

MAN (over loudspeaker):
On your marks. Get set.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.568
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

06:21.602 --> 06:24.321
I turned my ankle...
but I can run it off.

06:24.355 --> 06:25.772
(yelling) Roger!

06:25.806 --> 06:27.140
Stop! You're hurt.

06:27.174 --> 06:28.708
Why'd this happen to me?!

06:28.743 --> 06:30.994
I actually tried this time!

06:31.028 --> 06:32.462
(sobbing)

06:32.496 --> 06:34.130
Oh, honey.

06:34.165 --> 06:36.983
Is there anything I can do
to make you feel better?

06:40.671 --> 06:45.625
You know, I was gonna give you
this after the race, but here.

06:47.178 --> 06:48.245
(gasps)

06:49.663 --> 06:50.630
What's this for?

06:50.664 --> 06:52.465
You won a Franny!

06:52.499 --> 06:54.667
It's because you worked really hard,

06:54.685 --> 06:56.720
and that's all that matters.

07:00.641 --> 07:02.809
Wow. I love it.

07:02.843 --> 07:04.728
Hey, could you pull over for a sec?

07:04.779 --> 07:06.780
(brakes squeak)

07:10.134 --> 07:13.503
(crowd cheering and shouting)
I did it!

07:13.537 --> 07:16.756
Oh, my God, what a gorgeous trophy!

07:16.791 --> 07:18.191
And flowers?

07:18.225 --> 07:19.526
Wait, I can't hold everything.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.695
I'm gonna have my friend hold my cone.

07:23.030 --> 07:25.031
(cheering and shouting continue)

07:33.004 --> 07:35.072
You did it! Yay!
We love you, Roger!

07:35.106 --> 07:37.191
Your butt looks so great
in those shorts!

07:37.225 --> 07:40.411
I could never get away
with those, not since the baby!

07:40.445 --> 07:42.112
You didn't win the marathon.

07:42.147 --> 07:43.414
Are you sure?

07:43.448 --> 07:45.015
'Cause everyone else thinks I did.

07:46.551 --> 07:47.885
What do <i>you</i> think?

07:47.919 --> 07:49.854
I think my trophy is a cooz magnet,

07:49.888 --> 07:52.690
and this photo won't scare off
any wang, either.

07:52.724 --> 07:54.491
I don't know why you did this.

07:54.526 --> 07:56.560
You worked so hard to get ready.

07:56.595 --> 07:59.597
I mean, you weren't gonna win,
but you would have finished.

07:59.631 --> 08:01.932
That would have been a <i>real</i> achievement.

08:01.967 --> 08:03.328
Actually, I wouldn't have finished.

08:03.335 --> 08:05.269
You see, I never went running
after breakfast.

08:05.303 --> 08:07.171
What? Then what
were you doing?

08:07.205 --> 08:09.957
ROGER: <i>Well, I'd start with one of
Francine's gigantic breakfasts.</i>

08:09.991 --> 08:12.443
<i>And then I'd leave the house</i>
<i>and jog to the corner.</i>

08:12.477 --> 08:13.711
<i>There, I'd have a cigarette,</i>

08:13.762 --> 08:16.213
<i>two if I ran into that looker Rhonda</i>

08:16.248 --> 08:17.548
<i>with the natural low hangers .</i>

08:17.582 --> 08:18.916
<i>Then I'd head down the street</i>

08:18.950 --> 08:20.667
<i>to where that house</i>
<i>is getting a second floor,</i>

08:20.685 --> 08:21.986
<i>pop into one of the Porta Potties</i>

08:22.020 --> 08:23.180
<i>for the constructions workers,</i>

08:23.188 --> 08:25.689
<i>and try to pass my enormous breakfast.</i>

08:25.724 --> 08:27.041
<i>That was always a struggle.</i>

08:27.075 --> 08:28.459
(Roger chuckles)

08:28.493 --> 08:30.444
<i>My only real exercise of the day.</i>

08:30.478 --> 08:32.546
<i>And I'd usually fall asleep on the pot.</i>

08:32.581 --> 08:34.732
<i>Those crappers heat up</i>
<i>big time in the sun,</i>

08:34.783 --> 08:36.900
<i>so when I woke up a couple hours later,</i>

08:36.952 --> 08:38.419
<i>I'd be drenched in sweat.</i>

08:38.453 --> 08:41.472
<i>Half the time, I pooed in my sleep.</i>

08:41.506 --> 08:44.975
I can't believe I wasted all
that effort on you for nothing.

08:45.010 --> 08:47.378
Well, I did win the marathon, so...

08:47.412 --> 08:49.580
You didn't win the marathon!

08:49.614 --> 08:50.681
You keep saying that.

08:50.715 --> 08:53.751
But my new Mazda Miata says otherwise.

08:53.785 --> 08:55.085
Oh!

08:55.120 --> 08:56.253
(whispering):
So sleek.

08:56.288 --> 08:58.822
Roger, I'm done with you.

08:58.857 --> 09:01.325
No more praise, no more support.

09:01.359 --> 09:03.060
You don't deserve it.

09:03.094 --> 09:04.962
In fact, I'm taking back my Franny.

09:04.996 --> 09:06.180
(gasps) How could you...?

09:06.214 --> 09:07.414
What... I worked for that.

09:07.449 --> 09:08.649
No, you didn't.

09:08.683 --> 09:11.285
But I want it!
What are you gonna do with it?

09:11.319 --> 09:12.453
I don't know.

09:12.487 --> 09:13.954
Maybe I'll give it to Steve.

09:13.989 --> 09:15.122
Steve? You hate Steve.

09:15.156 --> 09:16.557
You always say you hate him.

09:16.591 --> 09:17.725
I never said that.

09:17.759 --> 09:19.627
Then why is it tattooed on your butt?

09:19.661 --> 09:21.128
Oh, that's ridiculous.

09:21.162 --> 09:24.231
He's just lashing out
because I took his Franny back.

09:24.266 --> 09:25.966
Nope, it's right here on her butt.

09:26.001 --> 09:27.268
I... hate... Steve.

09:27.302 --> 09:29.336
(laughs)
He-he's just joshing, right, Ma?

09:29.371 --> 09:31.338
Ugh! Look!

09:31.373 --> 09:32.573
There's nothing there!

09:32.607 --> 09:33.907
Oh, God, Mom!

09:33.942 --> 09:36.677
Ha-ha, you B.A.'d
your son!

09:36.711 --> 09:39.079
Uh... the
bus is here?

09:39.114 --> 09:40.981
Get out of here, Snot!

09:43.018 --> 09:44.418
Franny, let's go.

09:44.436 --> 09:46.086
I need you to take a picture

09:46.121 --> 09:48.222
of me and the Miata for my trophy case.

09:48.256 --> 09:50.024
I told you I was done, Roger.

09:50.058 --> 09:52.026
Oh, we're really doing this, huh?

09:52.060 --> 09:54.261
Fine. I don't need
you in my life!

09:57.232 --> 10:00.134
I don't need Francine
or her stupid award.

10:00.168 --> 10:02.703
I'll take my <i>own</i> celebratory picture.

10:02.737 --> 10:03.937
(beep)

10:03.972 --> 10:05.372
(camera shutter clicks)

10:05.407 --> 10:06.874
Ugh!

10:06.908 --> 10:08.909
(beep)

10:19.487 --> 10:20.721
Oh, what the...!

10:20.755 --> 10:22.056
(click)

10:24.259 --> 10:25.793
(beep)

10:25.827 --> 10:29.430
(camera shutter clicking)

10:37.172 --> 10:39.239
(singsongy):
Hey. Knock, knock.

10:39.274 --> 10:41.925
Here's the guy
who maybe needs his friend

10:41.960 --> 10:43.944
more than he admitted.

10:43.978 --> 10:45.379
What happened to you?

10:45.413 --> 10:47.247
A guy punched me in my face,

10:47.282 --> 10:48.849
but that probably makes you happy

10:48.883 --> 10:50.417
because you hate me so much.

10:50.452 --> 10:51.769
I don't hate you.

10:51.803 --> 10:54.772
I'm just done investing my time in you.

10:54.806 --> 10:57.041
I'm done being the sucker, Roger.

10:57.075 --> 10:59.910
You're lazy and a cheat, and I'm done.

10:59.944 --> 11:01.762
No, I need you!
I'm-I'm sorry.

11:01.796 --> 11:03.263
Look, I-I won't be lazy.

11:03.298 --> 11:04.898
I'll do something real.
I promise.

11:04.933 --> 11:07.568
Your word is as worthless
as your diploma.

11:07.602 --> 11:10.137
Is that what this is about?
The diploma?

11:10.171 --> 11:12.306
Well, what if I go earn it?

11:12.340 --> 11:14.825
What if I become
the best damn archaeologist

11:14.859 --> 11:16.410
this town's ever seen?

11:16.444 --> 11:18.679
Then you'll have to give me
my Franny back!

11:18.713 --> 11:20.514
Sounds great, Roger.
Knock yourself out.

11:20.532 --> 11:21.681
You'll see!

11:21.699 --> 11:23.417
Hey, is that my underwear in there?

11:23.451 --> 11:25.836
I told you never to wash my underwear!

11:25.870 --> 11:28.272
Great, now I got
to start all over again!

11:28.306 --> 11:30.657
(farting repeatedly)

11:33.194 --> 11:34.828
I can't turn this in.

11:34.863 --> 11:36.930
It's all about my dad killing people!

11:36.965 --> 11:41.602
Callour dad again and get him
to talk about something else.

11:41.636 --> 11:42.736
(phone rings)

11:42.771 --> 11:43.804
Hello?

11:43.838 --> 11:46.039
H-Hey, Dad.
Son, glad you called.

11:46.074 --> 11:48.358
I was kind of bumming,
thinking about your mom.

11:48.393 --> 11:49.760
What? Why?

11:49.794 --> 11:52.663
(groans) I feel our lovemaking
has lost all its intimacy.

11:52.697 --> 11:54.798
We're not attuned
to each other's love energies.

11:54.833 --> 11:58.602
We're just slamming away.
Dad! I-I'm here with the guys on speakerphone.

11:58.636 --> 11:59.636
Hey, guys.

11:59.671 --> 12:01.805
Yeah, lovemaking sure can turn into sex

12:01.840 --> 12:03.540
without you even noticing it.

12:03.575 --> 12:05.976
And why not?
Sex with your mom feels great.

12:06.010 --> 12:08.078
It's easy to think maybe that <i>is</i> love.

12:08.113 --> 12:09.913
And then there's the performer in me

12:09.948 --> 12:12.049
always trying to get your mom turned on.

12:12.083 --> 12:14.151
I pull her hair,
choke her lightly--

12:14.185 --> 12:14.987
or not so lightly...

12:15.107 --> 12:17.604
Dad, when you were my age, what
was the cost of a loaf of bread?

12:17.724 --> 12:19.690
The focus becomes how hot she gets,

12:19.724 --> 12:22.292
how many times I can make her
shudder with pleasure...

12:22.327 --> 12:24.328
All right, this is enough.

12:25.363 --> 12:28.132
Dad, what do Mom's boobs look like?

12:28.166 --> 12:30.701
I'll tell you, Snot--
they're perfect.

12:30.735 --> 12:34.004
Creamy twins with faint blue
veins running over them

12:34.038 --> 12:37.641
like cooling streams
I can wash my face in.

12:37.675 --> 12:40.577
(objects clattering)

12:44.749 --> 12:46.717
It's 5:00 in
the morning.

12:46.751 --> 12:48.152
What are you doing?

12:48.186 --> 12:50.320
Why, I'm getting ready
to go to the dig site.

12:50.355 --> 12:52.890
Come on, Roger,
what are you really doing?

12:52.924 --> 12:56.076
Well... why don't I show you.

12:58.112 --> 13:01.281
(loudly): Two millions years ago a
glacier cut through this valley.

13:01.299 --> 13:04.168
The river used to flow east to west.

13:04.219 --> 13:06.503
That's why I knew we had to start south,

13:06.538 --> 13:09.006
where an ancient tribe
would have a fresh water source.

13:09.057 --> 13:10.841
(loudly):
How do you know all this?

13:10.892 --> 13:12.559
Well, hell, Francine...

13:12.594 --> 13:14.561
(quietly):
I'm an archaeologist.

13:14.596 --> 13:18.065
Why do you keep leaning
in when I say stuff?

13:18.099 --> 13:21.185
(laughs):
Roger! This is... amazing!

13:21.219 --> 13:22.870
Yeah, well, not <i>so</i> amazing.

13:22.904 --> 13:24.538
We haven't turned up anything yet.

13:24.572 --> 13:26.523
You... you did all this?

13:26.574 --> 13:27.991
Well, me and Jabari.

13:28.026 --> 13:31.361
Jabari, show Francine how
you wear your shirt sometimes.

13:32.697 --> 13:35.849
That's how he wears it sometimes.

13:35.884 --> 13:37.050
Hello!

13:40.989 --> 13:43.123
What do we have here?

13:43.157 --> 13:44.758
What is it?

13:44.792 --> 13:48.979
If this is what I think it is,
I should be able to do <i>this.</i>

13:50.181 --> 13:51.832
(playing melody)

13:51.866 --> 13:55.469
Wow, Roger, you really
found something... Waah!

13:55.503 --> 13:56.753
Look out, boss!

13:56.788 --> 13:58.288
(crackling)
(both screaming)

13:58.323 --> 13:59.839
(screaming continues)

14:03.845 --> 14:06.230
(gasping breaths)

14:10.017 --> 14:11.985
Oh, my God! Roger!

14:12.020 --> 14:14.655
I think you've found a lost tribe!

14:14.689 --> 14:16.323
<i>Ednolb riah.</i>

14:16.357 --> 14:18.458
Hmm, they're speaking Sadrawkcab,

14:18.493 --> 14:20.494
the language of an indigenous tribe

14:20.528 --> 14:22.980
that lived in these mountains
thousands of years ago.

14:23.014 --> 14:26.099
Roger, all your hard work has paid off!

14:26.134 --> 14:29.236
You've made one of the greatest
discoveries of all time!

14:29.270 --> 14:31.238
<i>Stel Y-trap!</i>
<i>Stel Y-trap!</i>

14:31.272 --> 14:33.073
Looks like they want to welcome us

14:33.107 --> 14:34.408
with a traditional celebration.

14:34.442 --> 14:36.410
I am so proud of you.

14:36.444 --> 14:38.545
You finally did something real!

14:39.581 --> 14:41.365
(chuckles):
Well, she bought it.

14:41.399 --> 14:43.400
Hey, don't break character.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.604
Hey, I saw you on <i>CSI</i> last week.

14:47.639 --> 14:50.274
Oh, yeah?
You ruined the episode.

14:53.027 --> 14:55.472
I can't believe you
discovered a lost tribe.

14:55.592 --> 14:57.360
You know, before you brought me here

14:57.394 --> 14:58.962
I thought all this archaeology stuff

14:58.996 --> 15:00.830
was just another one of your scams.

15:00.864 --> 15:03.333
I was ready to write you off for good.

15:03.367 --> 15:06.636
(laughs): Well, good thing you're gonna
give me my Franny back instead, huh?

15:06.670 --> 15:08.771
(chuckles):
Well, I should say <i>so.</i>

15:08.806 --> 15:11.207
(primitive music playing)

16:07.598 --> 16:09.065
What? No.

16:09.099 --> 16:11.818
We need to stay and study these people.

This is all so fascinating.

16:15.155 --> 16:17.223
Oh, (bleep).

16:19.760 --> 16:23.229
...and that's why my dad

16:29.770 --> 16:31.904
Yeah. Uh, see...

m-my dad wasn't really willing
to answer the questions.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.809
Sounds like a whole lot
of nonsense, Steve.

16:36.844 --> 16:39.312
You know what I think?
I think you're just trying

16:39.346 --> 16:40.847
to get out of this assignment.

16:40.881 --> 16:42.548
Oh, is that what you think?

16:42.583 --> 16:45.084
Okay, Mr. Brink, here we go.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.086
(line rings)

16:47.121 --> 16:48.221
Hello?
Hey, Dad.

16:48.255 --> 16:49.589
I'm calling from my history class.

16:49.623 --> 16:51.657
So, who was president
when you were a kid?

16:51.692 --> 16:53.526
Oh, I don't know, I guess I think

16:53.560 --> 16:55.194
about killinmyself pretty frequently.

16:55.229 --> 16:57.597
And why not?
What's so great about living?

16:57.631 --> 16:59.265
You know when I'm happy?

16:59.299 --> 17:01.033
For about five seconds in the morning

17:01.068 --> 17:03.836
when I first wake up,
before I remember who I am

17:03.871 --> 17:05.771
and what my life is all about--

17:05.806 --> 17:08.022
(voice breaks):
anxiety, disappointment...

17:08.040 --> 17:10.460
diarrhea more often than not.

17:10.493 --> 17:13.563
(sighs) I don't... I don't
know if there's an afterlife,

17:13.597 --> 17:15.231
but who cares?

17:15.265 --> 17:16.883
Nothingness couldn't be any worse

17:16.916 --> 17:19.719
than this meaningless march
through my empty days.

17:19.752 --> 17:21.621
(beep)
See, Mr. Brink?

17:22.656 --> 17:24.056
Mr. Brink?

17:24.090 --> 17:26.459
He's right--
it's pointless.

17:26.492 --> 17:28.995
Life dismissed.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.281
(loud thud)

17:34.818 --> 17:36.452
This was supposed to last three hours.

17:36.487 --> 17:38.588
We only rehearsed the dance
number and the feast.

17:38.622 --> 17:42.091
We're out of material.
Hey, you guys all had improv on your résumés.

17:42.126 --> 17:45.428
(loudly and slowly):
Is this your drinking water?

17:47.631 --> 17:49.799
Um...

17:49.833 --> 17:51.834
goo-goo gah-gah?

17:52.870 --> 17:54.837
Look, people want to go home.

17:54.872 --> 17:56.339
They have families.

17:56.373 --> 17:58.374
I know Hannah's son has a fever.

17:58.408 --> 18:01.861
It's bad. He's throwing up right now
at home with a 14-year-old babysitter.

18:01.895 --> 18:05.031
Aw, geez, Hannah, why...
why don't you just leave?

18:05.065 --> 18:07.099
Because I drove with Gary.

18:07.134 --> 18:09.769
So Gary can go, too.
Screw it, take Gary.

18:09.803 --> 18:12.505
Gary doesn't want to leave.

18:12.539 --> 18:14.440
(moaning)

18:14.474 --> 18:16.275
I-I don't know
what to tell you, Hannah.

18:16.310 --> 18:17.877
All right, all right, how about this?

18:17.911 --> 18:19.812
I'll do something
that makes the tribe mad,

18:19.847 --> 18:22.098
and you guys chase us out of here.

18:24.635 --> 18:26.919
Staying was a really
cool idea, Francine.

18:26.954 --> 18:28.387
I've learned so much.

18:28.422 --> 18:31.040
Like, for instance, they're
a tchotchke-based culture.

18:31.074 --> 18:34.143
They think these things hold
the spirits of their ancestors.

18:34.178 --> 18:36.295
Oh, God! Oh, no!

18:36.330 --> 18:39.382
Oh, if this thing breaks,
there's gonna be trouble.

18:45.172 --> 18:46.272
<i>Teg meht!</i>

18:46.306 --> 18:47.473
Run!

18:47.507 --> 18:49.158
(angry shouting)

18:49.193 --> 18:50.810
(screaming)

18:50.844 --> 18:52.995
Shoot. Must have
taken a wrong turn.

18:53.030 --> 18:54.163
(shouting stops)

18:54.198 --> 18:56.332
Um...

18:56.366 --> 18:58.267
Um... this way!

18:59.570 --> 19:01.153
(angry shouting)

19:01.188 --> 19:02.822
We're gonna make it!

19:02.856 --> 19:04.040
(screams)

19:05.058 --> 19:07.226
No!

19:08.262 --> 19:09.395
(weak groan)

19:09.429 --> 19:10.930
No way.

19:12.132 --> 19:14.200
(gasps, indistinct chatter) Oh, my God!

19:14.234 --> 19:15.368
What's going on?

19:15.402 --> 19:16.736
We're actors!

19:16.770 --> 19:19.572
You just killed Cuba Gooding Jr.

19:21.708 --> 19:25.361
Show me... the heaven.

19:25.395 --> 19:27.079
(groans)

19:29.850 --> 19:32.952
Roger, what the hell is going on?
Fine.

19:32.986 --> 19:34.754
I staged everything, okay?

19:34.788 --> 19:37.723
This isn't a tribe; these
are all actors and actresses.

19:37.758 --> 19:40.760
Actually, we prefer to be
called "actors" now, as well.

19:40.794 --> 19:41.861
Shut up, Hannah!

19:41.895 --> 19:43.696
So this was all a setup?

19:43.730 --> 19:45.698
But... how?

19:45.732 --> 19:47.400
How did you do all this?

19:47.434 --> 19:49.402
Well, it started with the casting.

19:49.436 --> 19:52.238
Ryan Creamwell.
I'm with Preferred Artists.

19:52.272 --> 19:55.625
Take off your shirt and throw it to me.

19:55.659 --> 19:56.692
(sniffs)

19:56.727 --> 19:58.561
It's disgusting.
You got the part.

19:58.595 --> 20:00.362
<i>Then it was on to the choreography.</i>

20:00.380 --> 20:02.365
No, no, no, no!
Eyes on me!

20:02.399 --> 20:05.167
One and two and kick
and tush and kick and bush

20:05.202 --> 20:06.802
and finger, finger,
finger, finger, finger.

20:06.837 --> 20:10.640
<i>And then I had to find</i>
<i>my young boy assistant.</i>

20:10.674 --> 20:13.242
But why did you do all this?

20:13.277 --> 20:15.578
Because I wanted my Franny back!

20:15.612 --> 20:18.581
So what <i>I</i> think means that much to you?

20:18.615 --> 20:21.917
Yeah, but now you just think
I'm a big, lazy faker again.

20:21.952 --> 20:25.921
Lazy? Roger, I've never
seen anyone work so hard

20:25.956 --> 20:27.990
on anything in my entire life.

20:28.025 --> 20:30.993
You mean...
I impressed you?

20:31.028 --> 20:32.561
And how!

20:32.596 --> 20:35.498
I wish Stan was here to see this.

20:35.532 --> 20:37.733
Hey, where's my Oscar?

20:37.768 --> 20:40.202
(quiet organ music playing)

20:42.873 --> 20:45.174
This belongs to you.

20:46.877 --> 20:49.278
One last time, CGJ.

20:49.313 --> 20:51.080
(high-pitched):
Show me the money.

20:51.114 --> 20:52.515
(chuckles)

20:52.549 --> 20:53.883
(sighs)

20:53.917 --> 20:55.384
You will be missed.

20:55.419 --> 21:03.419
