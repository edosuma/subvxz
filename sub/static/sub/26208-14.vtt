00:02.168 --> 00:05.271
My name is Lena Grisky
and I go to the best
ballet school in the world.

00:05.305 --> 00:06.472
I have a secret.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.441
I'm a time traveler from 1905

00:08.474 --> 00:11.211
and my boyfriend Henri
is doing everything he can
to get me home.

(Lena) Previously...

00:47.814 --> 00:49.816
<i>The mid-season showcase</i>
<i>was a total disaster.</i>

00:49.850 --> 00:51.451
Henri's here!

00:51.852 --> 00:53.286
Or you can dance.

00:53.319 --> 00:55.121
(Lena)
First I kissed Max on stage...

00:55.155 --> 00:56.557
(the audience gasps)

00:56.590 --> 00:58.391
...and took off
in front of everyone...

00:58.424 --> 00:59.425
Where is she?

00:59.459 --> 01:00.126
Lena!

01:00.694 --> 01:01.695
<i>Then I missed Henri.</i>

01:01.728 --> 01:02.763
Henri!

01:02.796 --> 01:05.766
<i>And lost my timepiece</i>
<i>to the Time Collectors.</i>

01:05.799 --> 01:07.534
This is bad.

01:09.870 --> 01:13.707
(suspenseful music plays)

01:44.771 --> 01:48.341
What happened? Why aren't you
a hundred years ago?

01:50.243 --> 01:50.877
Tighter.

01:51.377 --> 01:52.378
Just for a second.

01:52.412 --> 01:53.680
Even tighter.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.552
I saw Henri. He was there.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.286
And then he wasn't.

02:01.221 --> 02:02.789
(sobs) He just disappeared.

02:02.823 --> 02:06.392
He wouldn't travel through
the time space continuum
and just leave without you.

02:06.426 --> 02:07.694
But he did.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.665
He was right there
and then he was gone.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.399
Okay, was there
anyone else there?

02:13.433 --> 02:17.303
He can't have just disappeared
into thin air. That would be
scientifically impossible.

02:17.337 --> 02:18.872
Ines, I don't know what to do.

02:18.905 --> 02:22.576
Okay, let's focus on sneaking
you back to our room. Come on.

02:25.378 --> 02:26.747
Maybe he left a letter.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.182
He didn't. I already checked.
You did?

02:29.215 --> 02:34.487
Well, I was kind of expecting an
"I made it back home safely and
I miss you" letter from you.

02:34.521 --> 02:37.658
Which I would have written
and sent to you, I promise.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.527
You know, I'm glad we get
to spend more time together.

02:40.561 --> 02:44.197
We'll figure this whole thing
out. But right now,
we've got bigger problems.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.233
Oh no. I...
Kissed Max.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.936
And then I...
Took off? Yeah. That happened.

02:49.970 --> 02:53.640
And everyone saw.
And by everyone I mean...

02:53.674 --> 02:55.275
I'm in so much trouble.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.680
(ticking clock,
magical tinkling)

03:01.515 --> 03:04.250
(electric sounds)
(Henri groans)

03:04.284 --> 03:05.385
You idiots!

03:07.654 --> 03:11.291
Dad? I thought you were the Time
Collectors. What are you doing?

03:11.324 --> 03:13.226
Stopping you from
making things even worse.

03:13.259 --> 03:15.495
Look, I'm sorry. I can explain.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.465
No!

03:19.499 --> 03:20.767
Stop!

03:21.702 --> 03:23.704
(gasping)

03:26.039 --> 03:27.941
You don't know what you've done!

03:27.974 --> 03:29.442
That's where you're wrong, son.

03:32.779 --> 03:34.948
Ms Carré's going to kill me.

03:35.949 --> 03:39.586
Yeah... There's a good chance
you'll be locked
in the Garnier dungeons.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.487
This is really bad.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.357
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.
It's pretty bad.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.693
I can't think about that right
now. I've got bigger problems.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.328
What happened
with the Time Collectors?

03:48.361 --> 03:49.596
A high speed chase
with Security.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.866
And then I saw them heading for
the portal and they were gone.

03:52.899 --> 03:57.003
- Okay, well, at least we don't
have to worry about them for a
while.
-Totally.

03:57.037 --> 04:00.406
I got a good look at the funny
one, though. Pinky.
He's pretty cute.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.677
Are you serious?
I thought you were safe,
so I looked.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.747
Cuteness detected, that's
all I'm saying. I'm sorry.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.416
I'm gonna give you a hug now.

04:10.450 --> 04:13.554
Okay, you ready?
You ready?

04:13.954 --> 04:16.289
(laughs) Better?

04:18.058 --> 04:19.560
Yeah.
(Lena laughs)

04:21.528 --> 04:25.298
(Henri) But Lena was just there.
Why didn't you grab us both?

04:25.632 --> 04:28.001
And why didn't you just
turn the portal off?

04:28.034 --> 04:31.672
You didn't have to destroy it.
We had a working time portal.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.840
We could go anywhere, anytime.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.376
It should never have been built
in the first place.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.078
Lena was protected
by a time bubble

04:38.111 --> 04:41.815
and to break that time bubble,
I had to build my own portal.

04:42.583 --> 04:46.920
But instead you made a rip
in time that can't be fixed.

04:46.953 --> 04:50.857
Now we risk changing things that
were never meant to be changed.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.660
We've lost control of time.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.596
I'm just trying
to get my girlfriend back.

04:55.629 --> 04:59.399
By breaking every
time travel rule in the book?

04:59.432 --> 05:01.301
You really don't get it, do you?

05:02.836 --> 05:04.538
Come on, I'll show you.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.582
Okay.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.384
My mother always said, "At
the very least, look your best

05:18.418 --> 05:21.555
when the day ahead feels like
it might be the worst."

05:39.039 --> 05:40.707
(giggles with excitement)

05:43.944 --> 05:45.746
(laughs)

05:58.559 --> 06:00.661
Maybe it's like the rectangle.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.797
Dry my hair.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.767
(Ines knocks on the door)
You okay?

06:06.800 --> 06:10.537
Oh! I'm better than okay.
Thank you for asking.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.708
(sighs) Come on.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.179
Stop it! No! No!

06:19.212 --> 06:21.848
(screams)

06:25.218 --> 06:29.455
Okay. So, after we fix your hair
and wipe off your grandmother's
lipstick,

06:29.489 --> 06:31.424
then we need to come up
with a plan.

06:31.457 --> 06:35.428
If I was you, I'd go straight up
to Ms Carré and apologize.

06:35.461 --> 06:38.064
Oh, it's okay. I've got this.

06:38.098 --> 06:42.468
Lena. You're yogurting
your feelings, again.

06:42.503 --> 06:46.973
Hey! Nice hair, dude.
And nice freak out last night.

06:47.874 --> 06:50.611
I had stage fright once.
But I was twelve.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.780
And I didn't make out with Max
and run away like an ostrich.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.450
(Dash) Yo, has anyone read
this review?

06:57.483 --> 07:00.621
"Either something went terribly
wrong, or the Paris Opera Ballet
School

07:00.654 --> 07:03.590
has added chaos and disaster
to their season."

07:03.624 --> 07:06.627
"However, the enchanting
Thea Raphael and her partner
Max Alverez,

07:06.660 --> 07:09.162
delivered an electrifying
pairs performance."

07:19.272 --> 07:20.907
You stole Henri's letter from me

07:20.941 --> 07:23.910
and used it last-minute
to hurt me and help yourself.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.146
I will retaliate
when you least expect it.

07:26.179 --> 07:29.750
There won't be a duel
and it won't be at dusk.
But it will be something.

07:31.818 --> 07:36.056
If you ever kiss my boyfriend
again, you'll wake up in Russia
on a candle farm.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.958
(louder) Thank you
for saying so, Lena.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.793
Yeah, I guess
I did save the show.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.596
And you're welcome.
(Lena gasps)

07:47.167 --> 07:48.201
Are you okay?

07:49.202 --> 07:51.605
It's okay. I've got this.

07:57.644 --> 08:01.915
(Frank)
Well, isn't this just great.
We're stuck here now.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.755
What happened?
It was fine last night.

08:08.789 --> 08:12.292
(sighs)
We were in 1905 last night.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.761
And we used it to travel here.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.531
We're now stuck in 2018.

08:17.564 --> 08:20.867
Someone found it
and smashed it after we used it.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.869
That's why
we couldn't get back through.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.773
Loverboy's skeleton
isn't in that chair.
It must have been him.

08:26.807 --> 08:30.711
He'd have gone after Lena
at the Garnier and we would
have seen him.

08:31.077 --> 08:34.581
Doesn't matter.
We still got the portal.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.983
And we still got the timepiece.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.185
Whoa.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.122
Is that what I think it is?

08:42.155 --> 08:45.025
(magical tinkling)

08:46.827 --> 08:47.894
Come here.

08:56.603 --> 08:57.738
The rumors are true.

08:57.771 --> 08:58.672
It wasn't me.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.607
There's been talks of this.

09:00.641 --> 09:04.711
I never believed it.
But it's got the jagged edges.
It's been halved.

09:04.745 --> 09:08.081
This stone is from the source.
Only the source stones
are orange.

09:08.114 --> 09:11.217
There's another piece out there
somewhere. Do you know
what that means?

09:11.251 --> 09:12.986
That there's another piece
out there somewhere.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.856
Congratulations, Clive.

09:15.889 --> 09:16.857
But are you sure?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.926
Of course I'm not sure.
It's a working theory.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.096
But just think
of the possibilities.

09:23.129 --> 09:26.667
Think of the power.
First things first...

09:26.700 --> 09:29.135
I think we can use this
to fix the portal.

09:32.038 --> 09:33.139
(Pinky sighs)

09:34.808 --> 09:35.341
What?

09:36.577 --> 09:38.679
Why don't we use the portal
to go back to when it worked?

09:41.347 --> 09:42.916
Oh... Never mind.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.726
What do you see?

09:54.060 --> 09:54.861
What do you mean?

09:55.195 --> 09:57.097
(Victor) Red dress.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.699
(Victor) Time traveler.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.268
(Victor) Woman in blue.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.970
(Victor) Time traveler.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.675
You mean they've all been time
traveling this entire time?

10:08.709 --> 10:13.346
No... Time travel
was deactivated decades ago,

10:13.379 --> 10:16.750
by me and a few others
who realized its danger.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.720
But when you gave Lena the
timepiece, you reactivated it.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.022
To be fair, you never mentioned
the necklace was a time machine.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.924
And you never mentioned
you stole it.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.592
Okay, Dad.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.394
Maybe I should go and ask them
all my questions. Maybe they'll
have answers for me.

10:28.428 --> 10:31.732
Maybe they were initiated
in all the rules and precautions
for time travel.

10:31.765 --> 10:32.999
Maybe if you
loosened up a bit...

10:33.033 --> 10:36.302
Maybe you will learn to accept
that you know nothing at all.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.877
(students chattering)

10:45.145 --> 10:47.748
(Dash) So, have you talked
to Lena yet?

10:48.481 --> 10:49.816
Not yet.

10:49.850 --> 10:53.687
I can't believe she's here.
I can't believe
she's not expelled.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.222
What?
You don't think she will be?

10:56.256 --> 10:59.125
Dude, she ran out
in the middle of a show.

11:02.262 --> 11:06.166
So, are you pretending
the Max thing didn't happen,
too?

11:06.199 --> 11:08.034
Kind of.

11:08.068 --> 11:11.471
Well, till I find the right
time.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.139
How about now?

11:13.173 --> 11:15.208
Hey.

11:15.241 --> 11:16.710
It's no big deal.

11:16.743 --> 11:21.347
You should... You should talk
to Ms Carré about
how big of a deal it is.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.317
I just don't really
understand it.

11:24.350 --> 11:28.889
You weren't scared
or had stage fright
the other day on the street.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.324
No, I wasn't afraid.
That's not what...

11:32.893 --> 11:35.896
It's not what you think.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.330
I didn't mean to.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.000
Kiss me? Or run off stage?

11:40.033 --> 11:42.168
I didn't mean to kiss you.

11:42.202 --> 11:46.940
Well, I did, I just...
I thought I was leaving.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.375
(laughs) Maybe I should
just stop you from talking.

11:49.409 --> 11:53.146
No, I only kissed you because I
thought I'd never see you again.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.384
Well, that backfired, didn't it?

12:14.535 --> 12:19.439
Lena, I'm still waiting
for the part of "this"
that "you've got".

12:19.472 --> 12:24.978
I don't want to scare you,
but maybe you need to
prepare for the worst.

12:25.011 --> 12:27.113
Not getting cast
as a lead again?

12:27.147 --> 12:28.849
Worse than that...

12:28.882 --> 12:30.416
(Ms Carré) Miss Grisky?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.386
My office. Now.

12:39.225 --> 12:42.963
Oh, snap, she so don't got this.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.366
"Unless this was
a Commedia dell'arte piece,

12:46.399 --> 12:49.135
this show was
jarring and juvenile.

12:49.169 --> 12:53.774
Not what we expect from
the Paris Opera Ballet School."

12:59.946 --> 13:03.416
I can't express how sorry I am,
Ms Carré.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.118
I promise
it will never happen again.

13:05.151 --> 13:08.522
No, it most certainly will not.

13:08.555 --> 13:12.025
I've not been able
to reach your guardian,
but as soon as I do,

13:12.058 --> 13:14.928
you will be removed
from this school.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.033
Please.

13:21.535 --> 13:22.302
Don't do this.

13:23.236 --> 13:27.040
You are officially expelled,
Miss Grisky.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.242
But I have nowhere else to go.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.889
(Thea) Well, girls, I wonder
what Lena's doing
in Ms Carré's office.

13:43.223 --> 13:46.292
I mean, first the defilé,
then the mid-season showcase.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.996
It's pretty clear she's not up
to the Paris Opera Ballet School
standards.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.032
And you are?

13:52.065 --> 13:53.099
Excuse me?

13:53.133 --> 13:54.467
You'll do anything,
won't you, Thea?

13:54.968 --> 13:57.137
I know what you did
and I know why you did it.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.440
You want to sabotage Lena
because you didn't get the part
you wanted. Right?

14:00.473 --> 14:03.409
Hardly. Who runs off for a boy?
That's my first question.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.411
(scoffs) You don't get
questions.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.013
Says who?
Me.

14:09.182 --> 14:13.219
Why don't you stick to
finding the square root of 9584

14:13.253 --> 14:16.122
and I'll manage
who gets my parts
and how I decide to handle it.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.559
You are so vapid.

14:18.592 --> 14:21.895
And you're a weirdo.
Unimaginative.

14:21.928 --> 14:23.263
Nosy.
Vacuous.

14:24.598 --> 14:28.401
As much as this word play
is stimulating,
I've got work to do.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.036
Walk away, Thea.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.072
After you.
(scoffs)

14:45.986 --> 14:49.255
If you don't use a timepiece,
you shouldn't travel at all.

14:49.289 --> 14:53.259
To travel with a homemade portal
is like breaking down the door
when you don't have a key.

14:54.695 --> 14:57.430
But I had to make my own portal.
It was the only way
back to Lena.

14:57.463 --> 15:00.066
You made a rip in time itself.

15:00.100 --> 15:04.605
And when that happens, the
ramifications are catastrophic.

15:04.638 --> 15:07.107
What about the Time Collectors?

15:07.140 --> 15:10.010
They couldn't go to Lena
any more than you could.

15:10.043 --> 15:13.547
She's safe,
until the portals reopen.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.416
The Time Collectors
used the portal, too.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.585
(laughs) How?

15:19.720 --> 15:22.355
I kind of built it with them...

15:22.388 --> 15:26.126
(dramatic music)

15:37.771 --> 15:40.340
What exactly are you doing?

15:40.373 --> 15:42.442
Origami relaxes me.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.147
I can't believe
this is happening.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.982
What am I going to do?
Where will I go?

15:49.015 --> 15:52.018
Carré can't send you home
until she finds your guardian.

15:52.052 --> 15:56.022
And since that's your
boyfriend's dad from 1905, then
she's not going to find him.

15:56.056 --> 16:00.561
Yeah. I'm certain she'll give up
and not ask any questions when
she realizes he doesn't exist.

16:00.594 --> 16:04.230
Okay, I'm glad your sarcasm is
improving, but not helpful,
Lena.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.699
(chuckles) Sorry.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.269
I just need to figure out
how to change Ms Carré's mind.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.372
Yeah. That will be super simple.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.674
Really?

16:13.707 --> 16:15.041
That is such a relief.

16:16.176 --> 16:19.345
Okay, we need to work on
you recognizing sarcasm, too.

16:19.379 --> 16:22.382
Changing Ms Carré's mind is
going to be next to impossible.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.184
(sighs)

16:24.685 --> 16:29.089
Well... What does she love?
Or like?

16:29.122 --> 16:31.191
Is there anything she doesn't
hate? What makes her smile?

16:32.425 --> 16:35.395
I could give her a swan!
Or maybe perform a comical skit.

16:35.428 --> 16:38.565
Or an apology set to a mime,
with tasteful music.

16:38.599 --> 16:40.634
A crocheted set of doilies.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.136
Or a carefully arranged
set of flowers.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.105
Oh! I could commission
a portrait!

16:45.138 --> 16:47.373
Let's go see
if Henri has left a letter.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.043
Maybe he's late or delayed,
or coming back.

16:50.076 --> 16:54.080
We'll leave this whole
Ms Carré mission on hold, okay?

16:54.114 --> 16:55.315
Okay.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.751
But I have to get a swan to
Ms Carré by the end of the day.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.385
Of course you do.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.754
We'll go later.
I'll even come with you.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.222
Okay.

17:11.397 --> 17:13.567
(horses neighing)

17:15.101 --> 17:18.505
(Henri) I saw you.
I know you saw me. I was there.

17:18.539 --> 17:21.542
My father pulled me back through
the portal and destroyed it.

17:21.575 --> 17:24.277
There's something else going on
and I have to figure out
what it is...

17:25.245 --> 17:28.181
(reads) "...but you're safe.
No one else can get to you.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.283
And I'll come for you
as soon as I can.

17:30.316 --> 17:33.687
As long as you have your
timepiece, we don't have to
worry."

17:33.720 --> 17:37.357
Oh no! We gave the timepiece
to the Time Collectors!

17:37.390 --> 17:39.192
Okay, don't panic.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.961
Yeah, you're right.

17:40.994 --> 17:44.531
What is there to panic about?
The fact that we gave the
timepiece to the Time Collectors

17:44.565 --> 17:47.834
or that I'm kicked out of
school?
No big deal, right?

17:47.868 --> 17:51.572
Yep. Your sarcasm is definitely
improving. (chuckles)

17:55.175 --> 17:56.510
(video game noises)

17:56.543 --> 18:00.581
Okay, are you even trying, bro?
Come on.

18:00.614 --> 18:02.148
Challenge me.

18:02.616 --> 18:04.450
Do you practice
when we're asleep?

18:04.484 --> 18:07.420
I'm gifted.
I'm an expert in avatar combat.

18:07.788 --> 18:09.489
Maybe there's a school for that.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.658
Maybe you could not be
such a sore loser,

18:11.692 --> 18:14.895
because that's
three times in a row.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.196
Boom!
No!

18:17.363 --> 18:19.499
(Ines) Guys! Listen up.

18:19.533 --> 18:20.867
We've got a situation.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.571
Lena just got expelled.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.576
She's got this insane idea
that's gonna end
in an epic fail.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.546
(Ines) Basically she wants to
give
Carré an origami swan

18:32.579 --> 18:34.380
and perform a play for her.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.584
(Jeff bursts out laughing)
Man, L's hilarious.

18:37.618 --> 18:38.885
Guys, this is serious.

18:38.919 --> 18:42.756
If Lena walks into Carré's
office and performs a mime
apology,

18:42.789 --> 18:44.758
then she's not just
gonna get kicked out,

18:44.791 --> 18:46.459
she's gonna get locked up
for being crazy.

18:46.727 --> 18:48.261
(Ines) We need to do something.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.164
(Thea) Whatever. She totally
deserves to be expelled.

18:51.197 --> 18:54.568
What kind of dancer walks out in
the middle of a show because of
a little bit of stage fright?

18:54.601 --> 18:55.769
Oh, really?

18:55.802 --> 18:59.472
It was just stage fright?
Nothing else made her run off?

18:59.506 --> 19:01.207
Nothing, Thea?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.678
Fine. But I'm not helping.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.748
Okay, so the Ice Queen
of Winter Mountain is out.

19:07.781 --> 19:11.151
What about you guys?
Are we going to help Lena?

19:11.885 --> 19:13.920
I'm in.
I'm in.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.627
(sighs)

19:23.997 --> 19:26.366
(Clive sighs)

19:26.399 --> 19:29.435
Clive! I'm trying
to concentrate here.
Ouch. Sorry, mate.

19:31.805 --> 19:34.274
Quiet, guys.
I think I've got it.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.545
(magical whirring clock noise)

19:38.579 --> 19:40.947
(Clive) Ouch.
Clive! I'm trying
to concentrate here.

19:40.981 --> 19:42.082
Sorry, mate.

19:43.884 --> 19:46.520
Ouch.
Clive! I'm trying
to concentrate here.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.721
Sorry, mate.

19:49.623 --> 19:52.626
(Clive) Ouch.
Clive! I'm trying
to concentrate...

19:52.659 --> 19:54.227
Whoa...

19:56.496 --> 19:58.765
What was that, boss?

19:58.799 --> 20:00.634
We've got
something special here.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.436
This timepiece can create
what's called a Time Loop.

20:03.469 --> 20:07.808
You could have been trapped
doing
the same thing over and over
forever if I hadn't shut it off.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.010
I wonder what else it can do.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.513
Imagine what
the whole crystal could do.

20:12.546 --> 20:15.315
If we had the rest of it,
I bet we'd be unstoppable.

20:15.348 --> 20:19.753
(Frank) First things first.
Let's head back to 1905
and pay Victor a visit.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.988
Stop him before he stops us.

20:23.489 --> 20:26.760
Lena can't go anywhere
without a timepiece, right?

20:26.793 --> 20:30.864
(magical tinkling
and electric sounds)

20:30.897 --> 20:36.603
(clock whirs and squeaks)

20:39.005 --> 20:40.574
One question.
No questions.

20:40.607 --> 20:41.875
(Clive yelps)

20:41.908 --> 20:43.510
Good one, boss.

20:43.544 --> 20:45.646
Okay, let's roll.

20:45.679 --> 20:48.014
One. Two. Three.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.518
Be right there, boys.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.354
I got something
that needs doing first.

20:58.892 --> 21:00.727
You have a moment.

21:00.761 --> 21:03.764
Not to be confused
with an entire minute.

21:05.866 --> 21:08.034
(Ines) Okay, we're not gonna
sugarcoat this, Ms Carré.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.638
Lena totally humiliated
the school.

21:11.672 --> 21:13.940
But there's another way
to look at this.

21:13.974 --> 21:16.877
Since Lena's been here, she's
made all of us better dancers

21:16.910 --> 21:18.378
and maybe even better people.

21:19.513 --> 21:22.883
And we think that in the end,
she's made the school
a better place, too.

21:22.916 --> 21:26.720
(Jeff) I wasn't exactly
a trained ballet dancer
when I came here.

21:26.753 --> 21:29.389
But Lena's got a way of making
you want to learn, you know?

21:31.825 --> 21:35.328
(Dash) She's shown me
that dancing isn't just
about technique.

21:35.361 --> 21:37.898
I dance with a lot more feeling
now and it's because of her.

21:39.733 --> 21:43.837
(Max) Ms Carré, Lena is not
like anyone else here.

21:43.870 --> 21:49.009
She brings this old school vibe
that none of us
have seen before.

21:49.042 --> 21:53.780
Being paired with her
has changed everything for me.

21:54.380 --> 21:57.417
Lena is everything
this school stands for.

21:57.450 --> 21:58.819
She belongs here.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.722
Please let her stay.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.023
Your moment is up.

22:06.593 --> 22:07.528
(Max sighs)

22:22.876 --> 22:25.879
I certainly hope you're taking
those directly to Ms Carré's
office.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.380
Oh, I am!

22:28.615 --> 22:30.851
Wait, do you mean that literally
or are you being sarcastic?

22:30.884 --> 22:32.953
Oh no,
I mean that sincerely, Lena.

22:32.986 --> 22:35.889
Ms Carré's definitely
more likely to forgive
your abysmal behavior

22:35.922 --> 22:40.093
if you shower her with totally
random gifts like origami
and pineapples.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.596
(Kennedy) Hm-hm.
(Bree giggles)

22:42.629 --> 22:44.631
Thought so. (scoffs)

22:46.199 --> 22:47.367
(all laugh)

23:09.189 --> 23:10.957
What are you doing?

23:12.092 --> 23:14.761
Thank you for agreeing
to see me, Ms Carré.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.067
I made this for you.

23:22.035 --> 23:24.571
Please accept this hand-made
swan as a token of my gratitude.

23:25.005 --> 23:27.541
It took 62 tiny precise folds
to get it right

23:27.574 --> 23:29.810
and three tries
to make it to this scale.

23:29.843 --> 23:33.680
I'm very crafty. Oh, and if
you'd
ever like a lesson, I'd be more
than happy to teach you.

23:33.714 --> 23:35.949
My tutor was
quite the paper smith.

23:35.982 --> 23:38.151
No, you're right,
it takes years to learn.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.753
Oh! I've brought my sketch book.

23:39.786 --> 23:42.856
(Ms Carré clears her throat)

23:42.889 --> 23:45.659
I'm very, very sorry
for everything

23:45.692 --> 23:48.529
and I was hoping you'd
reconsider and let me stay.

23:48.562 --> 23:50.764
Lena...
Oh, I wrote you a letter.

24:05.846 --> 24:07.113
Anything?

24:07.581 --> 24:10.717
There's no yelling.
That's a good sign.

24:10.751 --> 24:12.753
(sighs)
I don't have a good feeling.

24:13.253 --> 24:15.689
(Ines) She led with the swan.

24:17.991 --> 24:20.594
You ask not to be sent home?

24:20.627 --> 24:22.963
I am home, Ms Carré.

24:24.097 --> 24:25.532
I'm home when I dance.

24:25.799 --> 24:28.702
And the best place for me
to dance is here.

24:28.735 --> 24:32.839
I promise that I'll work harder
every day to bring nothing but
pride to you and this school.

24:32.873 --> 24:35.876
And I'll never run out
on a performance again.

24:35.909 --> 24:38.211
I understand your love of dance.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.013
You may stay.

24:40.046 --> 24:41.214
(Lena gasps)

24:41.247 --> 24:43.550
But you'll never make Company.

24:44.785 --> 24:46.920
You don't have what it takes.

24:46.953 --> 24:50.023
If you did, you wouldn't need
a second chance.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.424
And you're welcome.

24:55.295 --> 24:56.763
Thank you, Ms Carré.

24:56.797 --> 24:59.299
It's been a while,
maybe Lena's gaining ground.

24:59.332 --> 25:02.135
(Ines) Or she's miming
her way out of school.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.538
We should have done more.
We should have...

25:08.742 --> 25:12.012
Oh no. I'm so sorry, Lena.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.281
I can stay!
Yeah.

25:15.315 --> 25:18.084
(Jeff) Oh, yes!

25:20.220 --> 25:23.023
And you didn't think my origami
swan would work. (laughs)

25:23.056 --> 25:25.258
I didn't even have
to perform my comical skit.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.960
(all laugh)

25:27.761 --> 25:29.095
Thank you.

25:30.363 --> 25:31.865
All of you.

25:39.673 --> 25:42.776
(goofy laugh) You get to stay!
You get to stay!

25:53.119 --> 25:55.589
I can't believe this!

25:55.622 --> 25:58.592
How dare Ms Carré say
that I'll never make Company.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.326
(Ines) Do you believe her?

26:00.360 --> 26:03.964
Nope. She's wrong.
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

26:03.997 --> 26:05.866
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

26:05.899 --> 26:08.301
What if you're not here
long enough?
What if I am?

26:08.334 --> 26:11.672
Well, I won't complain. You
haven't even seen a roller
coaster yet.

26:11.705 --> 26:12.939
What's that?

26:12.973 --> 26:15.576
It's either your new favorite
thing or your new biggest fear.

26:15.876 --> 26:17.844
Well, maybe we'll find out.

26:17.878 --> 26:21.915
But we have two hours
until curfew so let's sneak in
some rehearsal time.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.750
Okay, let's go from the top.
