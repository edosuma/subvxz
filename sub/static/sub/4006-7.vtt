09:47.792 --> 09:49.583

09:53.125 --> 09:54.333

WHY THE BLOOD WORK

09:55.458 --> 09:58.125

WAS SO SPOTTY.

09:58.125 --> 09:59.709
YOU WERE
PROTECTING SOMEONE.

09:59.709 --> 10:00.834

AS PRICE KNOWS,

I'M AN INNOCENT LAB GEEK
IN OVER HIS HEAD.

10:02.834 --> 10:05.417

BEEN SEEING HER?

10:05.417 --> 10:07.834
- WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO KEEP QUIET?

10:07.834 --> 10:09.834
- IT'S NOT IN MY NATURE
TO KEEP QUIET ABOUT ANYTHING.

10:09.834 --> 10:11.583
- YOU CAN'T WRITE
ABOUT THIS.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.083

I'M JUST DOING MY JOB.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.166

NO WAY AROUND THAT.

GET MY FACTS STRAIGHT.

10:22.542 --> 10:27.417
I LOVE WRITING ABOUT CRIMES
FROM THE INSIDE.

10:27.417 --> 10:28.959

SOMETHING BETTER?

10:28.959 --> 10:32.709
WHAT BETTER THAN "LAB TECH
SEDUCED BY FEMME FATALE?"

10:32.709 --> 10:35.291
- I WAS THE LAST ONE
TO SPEAK WITH WAYNE RANDALL.

10:35.291 --> 10:38.208
I COULD TELL YOU
WHAT HIS LAST WORDS WERE.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.166
HOW HE REALLY FELT
ABOUT HANNAH.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.458

BUT YOU'D HAVE TO JUDGE
FOR YOURSELF.

10:46.959 --> 10:51.000
EITHER WAY,
I'D BE ON THE RECORD.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.125

SOME THOUGHT.

10:53.125 --> 10:56.250
IN THE MEANTIME, I'LL KEEP QUIET
ABOUT YOU AND HANNAH MCKAY.

10:56.250 --> 10:59.250

AROUND HER.

11:04.625 --> 11:07.750
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.542

TO STAY AWAY FROM HANNAH.

11:20.542 --> 11:22.875
AT LEAST I'VE BOUGHT MYSELF
SOME TIME.

11:28.041 --> 11:29.125
- THIS A GOOD TIME?

11:29.125 --> 11:32.500
- YES.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.375
MY THEORY
ON THE BARREL GIRL KILLERS

11:34.375 --> 11:36.333
WENT NOWHERE.

11:36.333 --> 11:37.792
I'M ON A DEAD END
ON BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.

11:37.792 --> 11:39.291

11:39.291 --> 11:40.834
WE COULD BRAINSTORM.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.000
I KEEP WONDERING
IF WE HAVEN'T MISSED SOMETHING.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.709
YOU KNOW,
SOME ANGLE, OR--

11:45.709 --> 11:49.166
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE
WE HAVEN'T MISSED ANYTHING.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.041
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I MEAN, MAYBE

11:51.041 --> 11:52.542
WE'VE BEEN SIDETRACKED

11:52.542 --> 11:54.875
BY OUR FEELINGS
ABOUT SERGEANT DOAKES.

11:54.875 --> 11:57.166
- I THINK
WE'VE BEEN OBJECTIVE.

11:57.166 --> 11:59.709
- WELL, I GUESS I'M JUST
NOT SURE, YOU KNOW?

11:59.709 --> 12:01.709
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HOLD ON

12:01.709 --> 12:03.291
TO AN IDEA OF SOMEONE,
YOU KNOW?

12:03.291 --> 12:05.542
TO REFUSE TO BELIEVE
THAT THEY HAVE A DARK SIDE,

12:05.542 --> 12:09.250
BUT EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE,
ALL THE EVIDENCE,

12:09.250 --> 12:12.500
IT STILL
POINTS TO SERGEANT DOAKES.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.750
AT SOME POINT,
WE HAVE TO FACE FACTS.

12:15.750 --> 12:19.000
- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE'VE BEEN
REACHING FOR LEADS.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.417
- SO SHOULD WE RETHINK
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE?

12:22.417 --> 12:25.417
I MEAN, I JUST--
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH IT.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.750
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:41.375 --> 12:43.208
- I'M FUCKING
GOING TO HELL.

12:45.041 --> 12:47.542
- SAL PRICE MADE HIS LIVING
WRITING ABOUT

12:47.542 --> 12:49.500
THE DARK THINGS
PEOPLE DO,

12:49.500 --> 12:51.792
BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE
A DARK SIDE OF HIS OWN.

12:51.792 --> 12:55.750
AT LEAST NOTHING
I CAN USE.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.250
[knocking on door]

12:57.250 --> 12:58.875
[knocking again]

12:59.917 --> 13:01.041
- YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

13:01.041 --> 13:04.333
- SURE.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.375
WHAT'S THIS?
- IT'S YOUR BLOOD SPATTER REPORT

13:06.375 --> 13:07.834
ON THE WAYNE RANDALL
VICTIMS.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.500
- WHAT ABOUT IT?
- WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING WEIRD

13:09.500 --> 13:11.208
I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD CLEAR IT UP.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.917
THIS BLOOD SPATTER

13:12.917 --> 13:15.792
POINTS TO A KILLER
OTHER THAN WAYNE RANDALL.

13:15.792 --> 13:20.208
SOMEONE SMALLER.

13:20.208 --> 13:21.333
- AND HOW'D YOU
COME TO THAT?

13:21.333 --> 13:25.250
- SAL PRICE HAD AN OUTSIDE LAB
RUN AN ANALYSIS.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.417
THEY FOUND
THE DISCREPANCIES.

13:26.417 --> 13:28.458
DID YOU MISS THIS?

13:28.458 --> 13:30.291
- PRICE STRIKES AGAIN.

13:30.291 --> 13:31.750
WHERE WILL HE
SHOW UP NEXT?

13:31.750 --> 13:33.792
DEB, I DIDN'T MISS
ANYTHING.

13:33.792 --> 13:35.500
I CONSIDERED
THE SAME SCENARIO.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.125
- AND?

13:37.125 --> 13:38.333
- BL--
BLOOD SPATTER

13:38.333 --> 13:40.959
IS LARGELY A MATTER
OF INTERPRETATION,

13:40.959 --> 13:43.083
BUT I'M CONVINCED
WAYNE WAS THE SOLE KILLER.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.834
- THESE BLOOD DROPS
CAME FROM THE KILLER.

13:45.834 --> 13:47.792
YOU COULD'VE TESTED THEM
TO SEE IF THEY MATCHED

13:47.792 --> 13:50.625
WAYNE RANDALL'S DNA,
JUST TO BE SURE.

13:50.625 --> 13:52.625
- I WAS SURE.
I DIDN'T THINK THE TEST

13:52.625 --> 13:54.083
WAS WORTH THE TIME
OR THE MONEY.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.291
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE CASE
HAD BEEN SOLVED.

13:59.917 --> 14:01.625
YOU WANNA JUST COME OUT
AND SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY?

14:01.625 --> 14:03.083
- HANNAH MCKAY
KILLED THIS WOMAN

14:03.083 --> 14:04.291
AND YOU'RE COVERING
FOR HER.

14:04.291 --> 14:05.291
- WHY WOULD I WANT
TO DO THAT?

14:05.291 --> 14:07.208
- TO SAVE HER
FOR YOUR TABLE.

14:10.291 --> 14:11.417
- YOU'RE WRONG, DEB.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.458
IF YOU WANT,
I'LL HAVE THE BLOOD TESTED.

14:13.458 --> 14:15.834
JUST SAY THE WORD,
WE CAN SPEND THE MONEY.

14:15.834 --> 14:18.625
- I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

14:25.041 --> 14:28.166
- [sniffs]
YOU SMELL THAT?

14:28.166 --> 14:29.834
- WHAT?
- SULFUR, MIXED WITH SHIT.

14:29.834 --> 14:32.834
MEANS ISAAK SIRKO'S ATTORNEY
IS ON HIS WAY.

14:32.834 --> 14:34.792
THEY WANT TO RUN
THEIR OWN ANALYSIS

14:34.792 --> 14:37.166
ON THE SAMPLES WE TOOK
FROM MATEO'S.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.750
- HMM.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.625
- CONFIRM THAT IT'S
HIS CLIENT'S BLOOD WE FOUND.

14:40.625 --> 14:42.417
MASUKA'S GRABBING IT NOW.

14:42.417 --> 14:44.208
- I'LL HAVE IT READY
FOR THEM.

14:44.208 --> 14:47.000
THAT EVIDENCE SHOULD KEEP ISAAK
LOCKED UP FOR A LONG TIME.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.500
ONE LESS KILLER
TO WORRY ABOUT.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.125
- I JUST CHECKED
THE FREEZER.

14:51.125 --> 14:53.250
THE EVIDENCE ON SIRKO
IS GONE.

14:53.250 --> 14:56.083
- OR NOT.

14:56.083 --> 14:59.041
- HOW IN THE HELL DOES THE MOST
CRUCIAL PIECE OF EVIDENCE

14:59.041 --> 15:02.208
AGAINST ISAAK SIRKO
JUST DISAPPEAR

15:02.208 --> 15:04.291
FROM OUR OWN
POLICE STATION?

15:04.291 --> 15:05.917
- I DON'T KNOW.
I LOGGED THE BLOOD SAMPLES

15:05.917 --> 15:07.542
INTO EVIDENCE MYSELF.

15:07.542 --> 15:08.959
- THERE'S ONLY
ONE EXPLANATION.

15:08.959 --> 15:11.458
THE KOSHKA BROTHERHOOD
HAS A MOLE INSIDE MIAMI METRO.

15:11.458 --> 15:13.208
- A MOLE?
YOU READ TOO MANY SPY NOVELS.

15:13.208 --> 15:14.917
MAYBE THE EVIDENCE
JUST GOT MISPLACED.

15:14.917 --> 15:17.208
- HEY, WE DO NOT
MISPLACE EVIDENCE.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.583
AND WHO READS ANYMORE?

15:18.583 --> 15:20.333
- SIMMER DOWN, TIGER MOM,
NOBODY'S BLAMING YOU.

15:20.333 --> 15:21.709
- MASUKA'S RIGHT.

15:21.709 --> 15:23.875
THIS IS WHY SIRKO'S ATTORNEY
ASKED FOR EARLY DISCOVERY.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.500
HE KNEW THE EVIDENCE
WOULD BE MISSING,

15:25.500 --> 15:27.041
WE'D BE LEFT THERE
HOLDING OUR DICKS.

15:27.041 --> 15:28.583
- WE CAN FIND OUT
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE LATER.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.083
RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE 24 HOURS

15:30.083 --> 15:32.333
TO FIND THOSE BLOOD SAMPLES,
OR TO COME UP WITH NEW EVIDENCE.

15:32.333 --> 15:35.500
AND IF WE DON'T,
SIRKO WALKS.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.041
- I'M GONNA GO
CHECK THE EVIDENCE ROOM LOG.

15:37.041 --> 15:40.041
SEE WHO'S BEEN THERE
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

15:40.041 --> 15:42.250
- THE CRIME SCENE AT MATEO'S
HASN'T BEEN RELEASED YET.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.792
MAYBE WE COULD RE-COLLECT
A SAMPLE OF SIRKO'S BLOOD.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.750
- FUCKING HAUL YOUR ASS
OVER THERE.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.041
MASUKA, QUINN,
GO WITH HIM.

15:52.458 --> 15:56.083
- WE LET A FISH THIS BIG SLIP
THROUGH OUR NET,

15:56.083 --> 15:59.625
I'M GONNA BE
VERY UNHAPPY.

16:02.458 --> 16:03.959
- YOU AND ME BOTH.

16:03.959 --> 16:06.125
- ANGEL, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE RESTAURANT?

16:06.125 --> 16:07.709
- I'VE BEEN APPROVED
TO TAKE OVER THE LEASE,

16:07.709 --> 16:10.750
BUT I STILL NEED A FEW THOUSAND
TO KEEP THE PLACE RUNNING.

16:10.750 --> 16:11.750
- WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

16:11.750 --> 16:12.792
- TURN OVER
ALL THE CUSHIONS,

16:12.792 --> 16:14.250
STAND IN THE CORNER
WITH A TIN CUP,

16:14.250 --> 16:16.500
I DON'T KNOW.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.125
UGH. UGH.

16:21.291 --> 16:22.542
- UGH--

16:22.542 --> 16:23.834
- HOLY SHIT.

16:23.834 --> 16:24.792
- I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE HOLY,

16:24.792 --> 16:27.125
BUT THERE'S NO DENYING
THE SHIT PART.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.041
- FUCKING KOSHKAS.

16:29.041 --> 16:30.625
THEY FUCKED UP
THE SEWAGE LINE

16:30.625 --> 16:33.000
TO CONTAMINATE
THE CRIME SCENE.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.750
- WHICH MEANS
SIRKO WILL BE FREE SOON.

16:35.750 --> 16:37.917
AND I'LL HAVE TO KILL HIM
BEFORE HE COMES AFTER ME.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.333
- NEED ANY MORE PROOF
THAT THERE'S A MOLE

16:39.333 --> 16:41.166
IN THE DEPARTMENT?
- I HATE TO ASK,

16:41.166 --> 16:43.291
BUT WOULD YOU GUYS
TAKE A LOOK AROUND,

16:43.291 --> 16:44.709
SEE IF THERE'S ANY BLOOD
ANYWHERE

16:44.709 --> 16:46.250
THAT'S NOT MIXED
WITH CRAP?

16:46.250 --> 16:47.750
- I WOULDN'T GET
MY HOPES UP.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.709
- THEY DO NOT
PAY US ENOUGH FOR THIS.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.458
- QUINN,
CAN I TALK TO YOU OUTSIDE?

16:52.458 --> 16:53.709
- YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
WAIT OUTSIDE

16:53.709 --> 16:56.125
WHILE WE'RE IN HERE
VOMITING?

16:56.125 --> 16:58.208
[sighs]

17:03.583 --> 17:05.709
- THE LIST OF VISITORS
OF THE EVIDENCE LOCK-UP

17:05.709 --> 17:07.166
IN THE LAST 72 HOURS.

17:07.166 --> 17:08.625
YOUR NAME'S ON IT.
- SO?

17:08.625 --> 17:09.834
- SO WHAT WERE YOU
DOING IN THERE?

17:09.834 --> 17:11.583
- I DON'T KNOW,
MY JOB, MAYBE?

17:11.583 --> 17:12.792
I'M A DETECTIVE,
OCCASIONALLY I HAVE TO GO

17:12.792 --> 17:13.834
TO THE EVIDENCE LOCK-UP.

17:13.834 --> 17:15.208
- WHAT WAS THE CASE?

17:15.208 --> 17:17.291
- THE DIXON MURDERS.
I GOTTA TESTIFY NEXT WEEK.

17:17.291 --> 17:18.792
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
I HAD MY DUCKS IN A ROW.

17:18.792 --> 17:20.083
WHAT THE FUCK
YOU INSINUATING?

17:20.083 --> 17:22.041
- YOU'RE DATING A STRIPPER
THAT WORKS AT A CLUB

17:22.041 --> 17:23.458
THAT'S OWNED
BY THE KOSHKA BROTHERHOOD.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.750
- SO YOU THINK I STOLE EVIDENCE
FOR THE KOSHKAS?

17:25.750 --> 17:26.625
- DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.208
- FUCK YOU.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.250
- HOLD ON.
YOU'RE NO CHOIRBOY,

17:30.250 --> 17:31.709
BUT I KNOW
YOU WOULDN'T SINK THAT LOW.

17:31.709 --> 17:33.375
- THEN WHY THE FUCK
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THIS?

17:33.375 --> 17:36.709
- BECAUSE
I'M DOING MY JOB,

17:36.709 --> 17:39.667
AND I NEEDED TO HEAR IT
FROM YOU.

17:49.583 --> 17:51.875
- NO, IT LOOKS LIKE
IT WAS DELIBERATE, DEB.

17:51.875 --> 17:54.500
WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND ANY
NEW EVIDENCE, AT LEAST NOT HERE.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.458
- WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH ANOTHER
SWEEP OF THE EVIDENCE ROOM,

17:56.458 --> 17:57.959
AND SO FAR
WE'VE GOT FUCKING ZIP.

17:57.959 --> 17:59.750
- I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA FIND ANYTHING.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.375
- NEITHER DO I.

18:01.375 --> 18:04.000
DEXTER, IF THIS CASE
FALLS APART AND ISAAK WALKS,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.625
HE COULD BE
ON THE STREET TONIGHT.

18:05.625 --> 18:06.667
- I KNOW.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.333
JUST HAVE TO
TAKE CARE OF HIM MYSELF.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.125
- STAY THE FUCK
AWAY FROM HIM.

18:10.125 --> 18:12.709
- I DON'T THINK IGNORING ISAAK
IS THE RIGHT APPROACH.

18:12.709 --> 18:14.041
- I'M NOT GONNA IGNORE HIM.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.959
I'M GONNA PUT A TAIL
ON HIM 24/7

18:15.959 --> 18:18.417
UNTIL HIS TRAVEL VISA
EXPIRES.

18:18.417 --> 18:20.250
HE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO PICK THE CRUST OUT OF HIS EYE

18:20.250 --> 18:21.208
WITHOUT US
KNOWING ABOUT IT.

18:21.208 --> 18:24.959
SO DON'T FUCKING
DO ANYTHING.

18:24.959 --> 18:27.667
- I WON'T.

18:27.667 --> 18:30.750
EXCEPT USE THE TIME
TO GET SAL PRICE OFF MY BACK.

18:30.750 --> 18:32.875
- [sighs]

18:34.917 --> 18:37.917
- THE ADDRESS FOR THE SISTER
OF HANNAH'S LATE HUSBAND.

18:39.625 --> 18:41.500
HER NAME'S LORI.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.834
- HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF THIS THING CALLED EMAIL?

18:43.834 --> 18:45.917
- I LIKE INTERACTING
WITH PEOPLE FACE TO FACE.

18:45.917 --> 18:49.959
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEIR FACE
LOOKS LIKE YOURS.

18:49.959 --> 18:51.291
- YOU CAN CANCEL THAT SHIT
RIGHT NOW.

18:51.291 --> 18:52.667
- YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH COMPLIMENTS?

18:52.667 --> 18:55.000
- YES, I DO,
WHEN THEY'RE SLIGHTLY CHEESY

18:55.000 --> 18:56.959
AND THEY COME
OUT OF THE BLUE, YEAH.

18:56.959 --> 18:58.959
I'LL TRY TO CONTACT LORI

18:58.959 --> 19:00.709
AND GET PERMISSION
FOR THE EXHUMATION.

19:00.709 --> 19:02.875
- CAN I TAG ALONG,
FOR THE INTERVIEW?

19:02.875 --> 19:04.291
- NO.

19:04.291 --> 19:05.458
IT'S GONNA BE
AWKWARD ENOUGH

19:05.458 --> 19:08.041
WITHOUT SOME GOOFY WRITER
HOVERING OVER US.

19:08.041 --> 19:09.792
- WELL THEN, MAYBE WE CAN
MEET LATER FOR DRINKS

19:09.792 --> 19:10.709
AND YOU CAN FILL ME IN.

19:10.709 --> 19:12.375
I DID GET YOU THE INFO.

19:12.375 --> 19:13.291
COME ON.

19:13.291 --> 19:16.250
IT'LL BE
TOTALLY OFF THE RECORD.

19:17.959 --> 19:20.917
- FAIR ENOUGH.

19:20.917 --> 19:23.500
BUT I'M BUYING.

19:31.208 --> 19:32.750
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

19:32.750 --> 19:34.500
- I'M OKAY.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.875
I THOUGHT I WASN'T
GOING TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.083
- THEY HURT YOU?

19:38.083 --> 19:39.083
- NO.

19:39.083 --> 19:40.917
THEY SENT ME TO THEIR CLUB
IN FORT MYERS.

19:40.917 --> 19:41.917
I WAS SO SCARED.

19:41.917 --> 19:42.959
I THOUGHT FOR SURE
THEY WERE

19:42.959 --> 19:44.417
GOING TO SEND ME
BACK TO KIEV.

19:44.417 --> 19:47.917
- I'D BURN DOWN EVERY ONE
OF THEIR FUCKING CLUBS

19:47.917 --> 19:51.625
BEFORE I LET THAT HAPPEN.

19:51.625 --> 19:52.667
- OH, MY GOD, JOEY.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.834
DID YOU PROMISE THEM SOMETHING
TO KEEP ME HERE?

19:54.834 --> 19:56.417
- DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

19:56.417 --> 19:59.000
- I WARNED YOU
ABOUT THE KOSHKAS.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.208
- I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

20:00.208 --> 20:02.166
AND I CAN TAKE CARE
OF THE BOTH OF US.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.291
HMM?
LOOK AT ME.

20:04.291 --> 20:06.709
VERY SOON, YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA HAVE TO WORK

20:06.709 --> 20:07.834
FOR ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE
AGAIN.

20:07.834 --> 20:08.959
- I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:08.959 --> 20:11.041
WHAT W--
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

20:11.041 --> 20:13.417
- YOU'RE GONNA BE FREE.
TRUST ME.

20:24.458 --> 20:25.625
- TOUCHED YOU WANTED
TO BE PART OF

20:25.625 --> 20:28.083
MY WELCOME BACK COMMITTEE.

20:28.083 --> 20:30.208
- MORE LIKE A PARADE.

20:30.208 --> 20:31.333
HEAT LIKE THAT'S
GOTTA MAKE

20:31.333 --> 20:33.959
A FLIGHT HOME TO KIEV
FEEL PRETTY GOOD.

20:33.959 --> 20:36.166
- NOT YET, GEORGE.

20:36.166 --> 20:39.083
MIAMI IS STILL OVERCROWDED,
BY ONE.

20:40.750 --> 20:43.834
- SO YOU SAID THIS WAS
ABOUT MY BROTHER JAKE?

20:43.834 --> 20:44.959
- YES.

20:44.959 --> 20:47.041
THIS MAY BE
A LITTLE UPSETTING,

20:47.041 --> 20:50.834
BUT WE NEED YOUR PERMISSION
TO EXHUME HIS BODY.

20:50.834 --> 20:53.542
- EXHUME HIS BODY?
WHY?

20:53.542 --> 20:57.375
- EVIDENCE HAS COME TO LIGHT
THAT YOUR BROTHER'S DEATH

20:57.375 --> 20:58.709
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
AN ACCIDENT.

20:58.709 --> 21:00.750
- BUT JAKE DIED
OF A HEART ATTACK.

21:00.750 --> 21:03.083
- WE BELIEVE
HE MAY HAVE BEEN POISONED,

21:03.083 --> 21:04.875
AND THAT HIS WIFE
WAS RESPONSIBLE.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.792
- OH, MY GOD.

21:06.792 --> 21:09.417
HANNAH?
- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THINKING.

21:09.417 --> 21:11.709
DID SHE AND YOUR BROTHER
GET ALONG?

21:11.709 --> 21:14.166
- YEAH, THEY SEEMED TO HAVE
A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.

21:14.166 --> 21:17.125
LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE
TOTALLY IN LOVE.

21:17.125 --> 21:20.917
ESPECIALLY AFTER THEY FOUND OUT
SHE WAS EXPECTING.

21:20.917 --> 21:22.375
- SHE WAS PREGNANT?

21:22.375 --> 21:23.834
- YEAH, SHE TOLD ME
IN CONFIDENCE.

21:23.834 --> 21:25.166
I WAS SURPRISED.

21:25.166 --> 21:27.166
I DIDN'T THINK
HANNAH WANTED KIDS.

21:27.166 --> 21:28.250
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BABY?

21:28.250 --> 21:30.542
- SHE LOST IT.

21:30.542 --> 21:32.250
RIGHT AFTER JAKE'S DEATH.

21:32.250 --> 21:35.625
IT WAS A MISCARRIAGE.

21:35.625 --> 21:39.083
YOU KNOW, AFTER THE FUNERAL,
HANNAH CUT EVERYONE OFF.

21:39.083 --> 21:42.291
IT WAS LIKE MY WHOLE SIDE
OF THE FAMILY NEVER EXISTED.

21:42.291 --> 21:44.208
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
I REACHED OUT,

21:44.208 --> 21:46.792
SHE JUST
WOULDN'T RECIPROCATE.

21:46.792 --> 21:49.333
- MS. KIRKWOOD, I THINK
WE CAN FIND OUT FOR SURE

21:49.333 --> 21:52.667
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR BROTHER.

21:52.667 --> 21:55.417
WE JUST NEED YOUR HELP.

21:59.291 --> 22:01.041
- THAT LOOKS HEAVY.
NEED A HAND?

22:01.041 --> 22:02.792
- I NEED YOU
OUT OF MY LIFE.

22:02.792 --> 22:03.709
- THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.

22:03.709 --> 22:05.417
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TALK TO ME.

22:05.417 --> 22:06.625
- WELL, EVERYTHING
I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU

22:06.625 --> 22:07.959
CAN BE SUMMED UP
IN TWO WORDS--

22:07.959 --> 22:09.750
- LET ME GUESS--
"FUCK OFF."

22:09.750 --> 22:11.709
- GLAD WE GOT THAT STRAIGHT.

22:11.709 --> 22:13.750
- I WANT TO WRITE
THE AUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY

22:13.750 --> 22:14.709
OF HANNAH MCKAY.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.917
IT'LL GO
THROUGH THE ROOF.

22:16.917 --> 22:19.375
GOD KNOWS I HAVEN'T HAD
A DECENT SELLER IN YEARS.

22:19.375 --> 22:21.000
I NEED THIS, HANNAH.
- OH, I'M SORRY.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.417
I MISSED THE LAST PART OVER
THE SOUND OF MY HEART BREAKING.

22:24.417 --> 22:27.208
- YOU DON'T TALK TO ME,
YOU'LL FORCE ME TO SPECULATE.

22:27.208 --> 22:28.333
MAYBE EVEN
GET CREATIVE.

22:28.333 --> 22:30.542
- IT TAKES BRAINS
TO BE CREATIVE.

22:30.542 --> 22:33.875
- "HANNAH MCKAY NEVER LOST
HER TASTE FOR KILLING.

22:33.875 --> 22:37.333
SHE JUST UPDATED HER TECHNIQUE
FROM KNIVES TO POISON."

22:40.250 --> 22:42.166
JUST AN EXCERPT
FROM THE PREFACE.

22:42.166 --> 22:45.041
ALONG WITH SOME MATERIAL
ON ONE DEXTER MORGAN--

22:45.041 --> 22:46.959
WHO'S A FAN OF MY WORK,
BY THE WAY,

22:46.959 --> 22:52.041
AND HOW HE MANIPULATED EVIDENCE
TO HELP THE WOMAN HE LOVED.

22:52.041 --> 22:53.333
- I'LL DENY EVERYTHING.

22:53.333 --> 22:57.375
- WHICH WILL BE
GREAT PUBLICITY.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.875
- [sighs] OKAY.

22:59.875 --> 23:01.709
FINE, WE'LL TALK.

23:01.709 --> 23:06.041
JUST KEEP DEXTER
OUT OF THIS.

23:06.041 --> 23:08.875
- DEPENDS ON
WHAT YOU GIVE ME.

23:08.875 --> 23:11.834
- MY HOUSE, TOMORROW,
4:00 P.M.

23:18.583 --> 23:21.583
[phone ringing]

23:24.208 --> 23:25.125
- HELLO?

23:25.125 --> 23:26.667
- IT'S YOUR
FAVORITE AUTHOR.

23:26.667 --> 23:29.625
DECIDED TO TAKE YOU UP
ON YOUR WAYNE RANDALL OFFER.

23:29.625 --> 23:30.667
- YOU WON'T BE SORRY.

23:30.667 --> 23:31.792
- I'LL COME
TO YOUR PLACE.

23:31.792 --> 23:34.542
HOW'S TOMORROW NIGHT SOUND?
7:00 P.M.?

23:34.542 --> 23:36.375
- 7:00 IT IS.

23:40.709 --> 23:42.917
- PRICE COVERED A LOT OF MURDERS
DURING HIS CAREER.

23:45.125 --> 23:47.667
- THE BLOODIER,
THE BETTER.

23:47.667 --> 23:50.083
HE LIKES GETTING AT
HIS CASES FROM THE INSIDE.

23:53.458 --> 23:56.375
YOU CAN'T GET MORE INSIDE
THAN BECOMING A SUSPECT.

23:58.750 --> 24:01.083
- CHRISTY LAWSON.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.417
HER KILLER WAS NEVER FOUND.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.417
- PRICE WROTE A BOOK
ABOUT HER CASE.

24:04.417 --> 24:08.583
ONE OF HIS BEST SELLERS.

24:08.583 --> 24:11.583
ALL I NEED IS PRICE'S DNA
TO LINK HIM TO THE CRIME.

24:21.125 --> 24:23.083
- YOU SHOULD
THROW THAT AWAY, DEX.

24:26.333 --> 24:28.583
- HANNAH NEEDS TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

24:28.583 --> 24:30.625
- YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE
TO SEE HER.

24:30.625 --> 24:33.583
YOU COULD JUST
PICK UP THE PHONE.

24:37.125 --> 24:38.250
- [sighs]

24:42.667 --> 24:43.667
- CHRIST, JOEY.

24:43.667 --> 24:44.917
YOU'RE HERE SO OFTEN,
WE GOTTA GET YOU

24:44.917 --> 24:45.959
YOUR OWN PARKING SPOT.

24:45.959 --> 24:46.959
- I DID WHAT YOU WANTED.

24:46.959 --> 24:48.709
THE EVIDENCE
AGAINST SIRKO IS GONE.

24:48.709 --> 24:50.083
I WANT NADIA'S PASSPORT.

24:50.083 --> 24:51.250
SHE'S DONE WITH YOU,

24:51.250 --> 24:52.917
AND YOUR WHOLE
SHITTY FUCKIN' ORGANIZATION.

24:52.917 --> 24:55.750
- IS SHE?

24:59.125 --> 25:00.458
- YEAH, AND SO AM I.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.458
- WE'VE BEEN
WORKING SO WELL TOGETHER.

25:02.458 --> 25:03.542
WHY KILL A GOOD THING?

25:03.542 --> 25:04.667
- WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE FUCKING WITH?

25:04.667 --> 25:06.291
THINK I'M SOME
FUCKIN' ASSHOLE,

25:06.291 --> 25:07.458
ONE OF YOUR
LITTLE FUCKIN' BAG MEN?

25:07.458 --> 25:08.792
- TAKE IT EASY.
- YOU KNOW HOW BADLY

25:08.792 --> 25:09.750
I COULD FUCK YOU UP?

25:09.750 --> 25:10.959
- IT GOES TWO WAYS,
DETECTIVE.

25:10.959 --> 25:12.583
YOU DESTROYED
POLICE EVIDENCE.

25:12.583 --> 25:13.750
THAT'LL GET YOU
THROWN OFF THE FORCE.

25:13.750 --> 25:15.667
HELL, YOU'D PROBABLY
DO TIME.

25:15.667 --> 25:17.333
- STAY THE FUCK AWAY
FROM ME.

25:17.333 --> 25:19.250
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
JOEY.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.291
SO YOU THINK REAL HARD
ABOUT YOUR NEXT MOVE,

25:21.291 --> 25:23.667
AND WHAT IT MEANS
FOR YOUR FUTURE.

25:23.667 --> 25:26.667
AND NADIA'S.

25:45.625 --> 25:49.625
- YOU MANAGED TO STAY AWAY
FROM ME FOR ONE WHOLE DAY.

25:49.625 --> 25:51.875
WHAT HAPPENED
TO OUR PLAN?

25:51.875 --> 25:53.041
- SAL PRICE HAPPENED.

25:53.041 --> 25:54.041
- PRICE?

25:54.041 --> 25:56.041
- HE SAW US TOGETHER
WHEN I DROPPED YOU OFF.

25:56.041 --> 25:59.875
HE THREATENED
TO PUT ME IN HIS BOOK.

25:59.875 --> 26:02.583
I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

26:02.583 --> 26:03.709
- THERE'S MORE.

26:03.709 --> 26:05.500
HE SHOWED UP
AT THE FLOWER MART.

26:05.500 --> 26:08.542
HE WANTS ME TO GO ON RECORD
ABOUT MY TIME WITH WAYNE,

26:08.542 --> 26:12.375
OR HE'LL SAY
THAT I'M A MURDERER.

26:12.375 --> 26:14.375
- I'M GOING TO HANDLE
PRICE.

26:14.375 --> 26:17.417
- LIKE
THE WAY YOU HANDLED ME?

26:17.417 --> 26:21.250
- NOT EXACTLY.
I ONLY GO AFTER KILLERS.

26:21.250 --> 26:22.542
- LIKE ME.

26:22.542 --> 26:25.542
- IT'S THE CODE I LIVE BY.

26:27.667 --> 26:30.750
- CODE, HUH?

26:30.750 --> 26:32.583
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
LIFE JUST HAS TO BE TAKEN.

26:32.583 --> 26:35.750
THERE'S NO NEED
TO DRESS IT UP.

26:36.959 --> 26:38.375
- IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

26:38.375 --> 26:41.792
- I THINK YOU'RE JUST AFRAID
TO ADMIT THAT YOU ENJOY KILLING.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.709
- AND YOU DON'T?

26:46.709 --> 26:49.083
- NO.

26:49.083 --> 26:50.375
KILLING FOR ME IS JUST

26:50.375 --> 26:52.542
SURRENDERING
TO NATURE'S WAY.

26:52.542 --> 26:55.709
NATURE ADDS
AND SUBTRACTS.

26:55.709 --> 26:59.291
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.

26:59.291 --> 27:00.875
- SO YOU'RE THE FITTEST.

27:00.875 --> 27:03.750
- SO FAR.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.959
YOU EVER WONDER
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

27:08.959 --> 27:11.959
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ALL THESE RULES?

27:17.375 --> 27:20.667
- PRICE DOESN'T HAVE TO DIE.

27:20.667 --> 27:23.291
I CAN GET HIM
TO BACK OFF FOR GOOD.

27:23.291 --> 27:24.959
- I'M USED TO DEALING
WITH THINGS ON MY OWN.

27:24.959 --> 27:26.625
I DON'T NEED
SOMEBODY TO PROTECT ME.

27:26.625 --> 27:29.500
- I KNOW YOU DON'T.

27:29.500 --> 27:32.625
BUT I HAVE THIS COVERED.

27:32.625 --> 27:37.000
CONSIDER IT
A GOOD-BYE PRESENT.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.417
- OKAY.

27:39.417 --> 27:43.041
WELL, I SUPPOSE
WE'RE GOING FOR A RECORD.

27:43.041 --> 27:44.375
- A RECORD?

27:44.375 --> 27:48.583
- HOW MANY TIMES WE CAN
SAY GOOD-BYE FOR GOOD.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.000
- GOOD-BYE.

28:06.083 --> 28:08.959
SHE ISN'T DRAWN TO MY DARKNESS
LIKE LILA,

28:08.959 --> 28:10.500
OR BLIND TO IT
LIKE RITA,

28:10.500 --> 28:12.667
AND SHE DOESN'T NEED IT
LIKE LUMEN.

28:12.667 --> 28:15.166
SHE ACCEPTS BOTH SIDES OF ME.

28:15.166 --> 28:19.166
THE WHOLE DEXTER.

28:19.166 --> 28:23.166
SO WHY AM I WALKING AWAY
FROM THIS?

28:23.166 --> 28:24.667
BECAUSE
WHEN SOME CHEMICALS MIX

28:24.667 --> 28:27.709
THEY COMBUST, AND EXPLODE.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.542
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE HERE.

28:32.542 --> 28:34.208
- HE'S MY BROTHER.

28:34.208 --> 28:37.792
- I UNDERSTAND.

28:37.792 --> 28:40.917
YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

28:50.333 --> 28:52.709
- WHAT THE FUCK?

28:52.709 --> 28:54.583
THERE'S NO TISSUE.

28:54.583 --> 28:55.583
THAT NORMAL?

28:55.583 --> 28:58.208
- IT IS IF THE BODY
WASN'T EMBALMED.

28:58.208 --> 28:59.875
- ISN'T THAT
STANDARD PROCEDURE?

28:59.875 --> 29:02.000
- UNLESS THE NEXT OF KIN
SPECIFIES OTHERWISE.

29:04.709 --> 29:05.709
- CAN WE DO THE TESTS?

29:05.709 --> 29:07.333
- NOT ON BONES,
LIEUTENANT.

29:07.333 --> 29:10.250
- THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO HERE.

29:15.458 --> 29:16.750
- WHAT IS IT?

29:16.750 --> 29:19.583
- YOUR BROTHER'S REMAINS--

29:22.917 --> 29:24.583
HE WASN'T EMBALMED.

29:24.583 --> 29:25.959
- WHA--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:25.959 --> 29:27.417
- WE CAN'T RUN THE TESTS.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.875
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
THIS WAS ALL FOR NOTHING?

29:29.875 --> 29:33.250
- I'M GONNA FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED, LORI.

29:33.250 --> 29:36.917
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP.

29:36.917 --> 29:42.083
- [sobbing]

29:49.709 --> 29:51.750
- I CAN SEE
THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA.

29:51.750 --> 29:52.583
- [sighs]
- YOU LOOK LIKE

29:52.583 --> 29:54.500
YOU NEED A DRINK.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.375
- YEAH, OR FIVE.

29:56.375 --> 29:57.625
- EXCUSE ME.

29:57.625 --> 29:58.625
BOTTLED BREW
FOR THE LADY.

29:58.625 --> 29:59.959
- UH--
ACTUALLY,

29:59.959 --> 30:03.750
CAN I GET A DOUBLE SCOTCH,
NEAT, PLEASE?

30:03.750 --> 30:05.291
- WHEN DO YOU GET
THE TEST RESULTS

30:05.291 --> 30:06.375
FOR THE EXHUMATION?

30:06.375 --> 30:08.041
- WE WON'T.

30:08.041 --> 30:09.458
THE BODY WAS MORE LIKE
A PILE OF BONES.

30:09.458 --> 30:10.458
THERE WAS
NOTHING TO TEST.

30:10.458 --> 30:12.166
- SHIT.
HE WASN'T EMBALMED.

30:12.166 --> 30:13.750
- YEAH, AND--
BIG SURPRISE HERE--

30:13.750 --> 30:14.875
IT WAS ALL
AT THE DISCRETION OF...

30:14.875 --> 30:17.125
both:
HANNAH.

30:17.125 --> 30:19.750
- THANK YOU.

30:24.458 --> 30:28.375
THAT POOR WOMAN HAD TO WATCH
HER DEAD BROTHER BE DUG UP.

30:28.375 --> 30:29.375
AND FOR WHAT?

30:29.375 --> 30:31.250
I PUT HER
THROUGH FUCKIN' HELL.

30:31.250 --> 30:33.125
- YOU COULDN'T ANTICIPATE
THIS.

30:33.125 --> 30:34.291
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
- WELL, IT DOESN'T MAKE IT

30:34.291 --> 30:36.542
ANY BETTER.

30:36.542 --> 30:40.500
SOMETIMES MY JOB
REALLY FUCKIN' SUCKS.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.709
ACTUALLY,
IT ALWAYS SUCKS.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.000
- WHY DO YOU DO IT?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.083
- 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO FUCK-ALL ELSE.

30:45.083 --> 30:46.375
- I'M SURE
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

30:46.375 --> 30:48.792
- OH, GOD, IF YOU ARE
BUILDING UP TO A COMPLIMENT

30:48.792 --> 30:51.125
NOW IS REALLY NOT THE TIME.

30:51.125 --> 30:53.625
- LOOK.

30:53.625 --> 30:55.125
I'M GONNA INTERVIEW
HANNAH LATER.

30:55.125 --> 30:56.291
MAYBE I CAN PULL SOMETHING
OUT OF HER.

30:56.291 --> 30:57.834
- GROSS.

30:57.834 --> 30:59.875
- [chuckles]

30:59.875 --> 31:02.959
- WELL, YOU CAN TELL ME
HOW IT WENT OVER DINNER.

31:02.959 --> 31:05.834
I MIGHT EVEN LET YOU PAY.

31:11.166 --> 31:13.125
- LEMONADE?

31:16.333 --> 31:18.208
- I'LL PASS.

31:21.375 --> 31:22.583
SHOULD WE GET STARTED?

31:22.583 --> 31:26.458
- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE'RE CLEAR.

31:26.458 --> 31:29.542
YOU'RE GOING TO FORGET
ABOUT DEXTER MORGAN.

31:29.542 --> 31:30.959
- HE REALLY GOT
UNDER YOUR SKIN, DIDN'T HE?

31:30.959 --> 31:32.458
- JUST TELL ME
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.208
- NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

31:38.458 --> 31:39.667
[digital recorder beeps]

31:39.667 --> 31:43.000
- WE'LL START WITH THE COUPLE
FROM THE MOTEL.

31:58.375 --> 31:59.959
- I JUST NEED
ENOUGH OF PRICE'S DNA

31:59.959 --> 32:02.125
TO PLANT
AT A CRIME SCENE.

32:06.875 --> 32:08.917
TRACES OF BLOOD.

32:08.917 --> 32:11.875
GOOD FOR ME,
BAD FOR HIS GUMS.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.125
[keyboard clacking]

32:43.125 --> 32:45.166
- THE MORE YOU LINGER,
THE GREATER

32:45.166 --> 32:46.834
THE CHANCE
OF BEING CAUGHT.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.625
- CRIME SCENE DATA,
AUDIO INTERVIEWS.

32:48.625 --> 32:52.125
IT'S PRICE'S RESEARCH
ON HANNAH.

32:52.125 --> 32:54.208
IF I GET RID OF IT,
IT'LL CRIPPLE HIS BOOK.

32:54.208 --> 32:55.875
MAYBE KILL IT.

32:55.875 --> 32:57.000
- YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
TO PROTECT HANNAH.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
YOU NEED TO THINK
ABOUT YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.

33:16.083 --> 33:18.792
- WAYNE GAVE ME
THE KNIFE

33:18.792 --> 33:23.166
AND TOLD ME
TO GUARD THE WOMAN.

33:23.166 --> 33:27.166
I FIGURED IT'D BE EASY,
SEEING AS HOW SCARED SHE WAS.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.250
- WHAT WAS WAYNE DOING?

33:31.250 --> 33:34.000
- HE STARTED
TO STAB THE HUSBAND.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.041
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

33:38.041 --> 33:42.917
THE WOMAN WAS SCREAMING
LIKE CRAZY.

33:42.917 --> 33:44.792
THE MAN SHE LOVED
WAS GETTING KNIFED

33:44.792 --> 33:48.208
IN FRONT OF HER EYES.

33:48.208 --> 33:50.166
BUT HE, UH--
HE DIDN'T--

33:50.166 --> 33:52.750
HE DIDN'T GIVE UP.

33:52.750 --> 33:55.917
HE GRABBED WAYNE
AND HE PULLED HIM TOWARD HIM.

33:55.917 --> 33:58.875
AND--AND THEN THE WOMAN
JUMPED ON WAYNE.

33:58.875 --> 34:00.000
- THE WOMAN
YOU WERE GUARDING.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
- YEAH, SHE WAS JUST
PROTECTING HER HUSBAND.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.250
I DON'T BLAME HER, I--

34:05.250 --> 34:08.166
I WOULD'VE DONE
THE SAME THING.

34:10.917 --> 34:14.542
- KEEP GOING.

34:14.542 --> 34:17.875
- WAYNE WAS YELLING FOR ME
TO GET HER OFF HIM, SO I--

34:17.875 --> 34:20.709
I GRABBED HER BY THE HAIR AND
I PULLED HER TO THE BED,

34:20.709 --> 34:22.458
AND SHE JUST--

34:22.458 --> 34:25.125
SHE JUST KEPT SCREAMING,
AND S--

34:25.125 --> 34:27.291
AND SCREAMING.

34:27.291 --> 34:29.709
SO I--

34:29.709 --> 34:33.208
I STABBED HER.
[sobs]

34:33.208 --> 34:35.792
AND SHE JUST
KEPT SCREAMING.

34:35.792 --> 34:39.000
AND THERE WAS
SO MUCH BLOOD.

34:43.375 --> 34:47.458
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

34:47.458 --> 34:53.041
- [sobs] I STABBED HER
UNTIL THE SCREAMING STOPPED.

34:53.041 --> 35:01.083
[sobbing]

35:09.875 --> 35:11.083
- TAKE A SECOND.

35:11.083 --> 35:18.250
- [sobbing]

35:25.834 --> 35:29.792
- LOOKS TASTY.

35:29.792 --> 35:33.250
CERTAINLY BETTER THAN THE SWILL
I'VE CHOKED ON OF LATE.

35:35.291 --> 35:36.792
DON'T WORRY,
I HAVEN'T COME DOWN HERE

35:36.792 --> 35:38.041
TO CAUSE YOU HARM.

35:38.041 --> 35:40.375
NOT YET.

35:40.375 --> 35:42.291
NOT WITH
MIAMI METRO'S FINEST

35:42.291 --> 35:45.417
SHADOWING
MY EVERY MOVE.

35:45.417 --> 35:47.458
YES, I CERTAINLY HOPE
THEY ARE THE FINEST.

35:47.458 --> 35:48.583
FOR YOUR SAKE.

35:52.417 --> 35:54.291
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

35:54.291 --> 35:56.208
- WELL, SO LONG AS
I'M WAITING AROUND TO KILL YOU

35:56.208 --> 35:58.166
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT
HAVE A LITTLE CHAT.

36:01.166 --> 36:04.125
MMM.
GOOD CHIPS.

36:05.625 --> 36:08.250
WHILE I WAS
INCARCERATED,

36:08.250 --> 36:13.000
I FOUND MYSELF PLAGUED
WITH A NAGGING QUESTION.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.250
I MEAN, I WILL
MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH

36:15.250 --> 36:17.458
TO SNUFF OUT YOUR LIFE
BECAUSE YOU KILLED VIKTOR--

36:17.458 --> 36:21.792
IN FACT, I WAS SO BLINDED
BY MY DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE

36:21.792 --> 36:25.709
THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO LEAD ME
INTO A TRAP.

36:25.709 --> 36:30.667
A MISTAKE I ASSURE YOU
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

36:30.667 --> 36:32.291
- WE HAVE A CARTOON
IN AMERICA

36:32.291 --> 36:34.875
ABOUT A COYOTE
WHO CHASES AFTER A ROADRUNNER.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.166
HE KEEPS THINKING THAT.

36:36.166 --> 36:38.625
HE KEEPS ROCKET-SKATING
RIGHT OFF THE CLIFF.

36:41.583 --> 36:44.250
- YOU SEE, I KNOW
WHAT MOTIVATES ME.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.250
BUT WHAT I DON'T KNOW
IS WHAT DROVE YOU

36:46.250 --> 36:47.166
TO KILL MY FRIEND.

36:47.166 --> 36:49.125
- I TOLD YOU.
HE KILLED MIKE ANDERSON.

36:49.125 --> 36:50.709
- A MAN YOU BARELY KNEW
FOR WHAT,

36:50.709 --> 36:52.917
LESS THAN
THREE MONTHS?

36:52.917 --> 36:55.166
OH, IT'S ALL
PUBLIC RECORD.

36:55.166 --> 36:57.291
NO.

36:57.291 --> 37:01.000
YOU DIDN'T KILL VIKTOR
OUT OF VENGEANCE.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.625
I HAVE A FEELING

37:03.625 --> 37:06.458
THAT YOU'RE A DIFFERENT
KIND OF ANIMAL.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.709
THE QUESTION IS...

37:08.709 --> 37:10.375
WHAT KIND ARE YOU,

37:10.375 --> 37:14.125
DEXTER MORGAN?

37:14.125 --> 37:15.458
- THE KIND WHO HUNTED
YOUR FRIEND DOWN

37:15.458 --> 37:16.583
AND STRAPPED HIM
TO A BOARD,

37:16.583 --> 37:19.458
AND PUT A PLASTIC BAG
ON HIS HEAD,

37:19.458 --> 37:22.083
AND CRUSHED HIS SKULL
WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

37:25.375 --> 37:27.208
THE KIND WHO'S GOING TO
DO THE SAME THING TO YOU,

37:27.208 --> 37:29.250
GIVE OR TAKE
THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

37:36.417 --> 37:39.417
- YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET
SHARING THAT WITH ME.

37:47.166 --> 37:49.250
FOR THE CHIP.

37:59.875 --> 38:01.583
- THIS IS
THE LAST LOAD.

38:01.583 --> 38:02.583
[knock at door]

38:02.583 --> 38:06.041
- THANKS, JAMIE.
- MM-HMM.

38:07.250 --> 38:09.291
- YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE AN INTERESTING GUY.

38:09.291 --> 38:11.375
- [exhales]

38:17.959 --> 38:20.083
- HAVE A SEAT.

38:20.083 --> 38:22.667
I SHOULD DO
MY NEXT BOOK ON YOU.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.000
BELIEVE ME,

38:24.000 --> 38:25.583
I KNOW A GOOD STORY
WHEN I HEAR ONE.

38:28.041 --> 38:29.250
- YOU KNOW,
AS A BLOOD SPATTER ANALYST,

38:29.250 --> 38:33.208
I'M KIND OF
A STORYTELLER MYSELF.

38:33.208 --> 38:34.458
ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US IS

38:34.458 --> 38:36.458
YOUR MEDIUM'S INK,
AND MINE'S BLOOD.

38:36.458 --> 38:37.583
- INTERESTING
OBSERVATION.

38:37.583 --> 38:40.125
- UH, BEFORE WE
TALK ABOUT WAYNE,

38:40.125 --> 38:42.792
I HAVE A STORY IDEA
OF MY OWN.

38:42.792 --> 38:44.333
UH, MOSTLY NON-FICTION.

38:44.333 --> 38:46.917
I WANTED TO GET
YOUR TAKE.

38:46.917 --> 38:49.333
- I'M ALL EARS.

38:49.333 --> 38:51.750
- SO NEW DNA EVIDENCE
POPS UP

38:51.750 --> 38:55.458
IN THE UNSOLVED MURDER
OF CHRISTY LAWSON.

38:55.458 --> 38:59.166
YOU KNOW, THE JOGGER WHO WAS
KILLED NEAR MATHESON PARK.

38:59.166 --> 39:02.125
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE DNA

39:02.125 --> 39:04.583
BELONGS TO
A TRUE CRIME WRITER.

39:04.583 --> 39:06.208
- YOU SAID IT WAS
MOSTLY NON-FICTION.

39:06.208 --> 39:07.834
SOUNDS LIKE
IT'S ALL BULLSHIT.

39:07.834 --> 39:10.792
- WELL, THE ANONYMOUS TIP
IS REAL ENOUGH.

39:10.792 --> 39:13.417
THE ONE THAT MENTIONS
SAL PRICE.

39:13.417 --> 39:16.208
IT SEEMS HE WROTE
A VERY SUCCESSFUL BOOK

39:16.208 --> 39:17.834
ABOUT THE SAME CASE.

39:17.834 --> 39:20.625
NOW IT TURNS OUT
HE WAS HER KILLER.

39:20.625 --> 39:24.500
YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE
THE IRONY.

39:24.500 --> 39:28.875
- HOW DO YOU PLAN
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN, EXACTLY?

39:28.875 --> 39:30.083
- LET'S JUST SAY
YOU'RE GONNA NEED

39:30.083 --> 39:33.125
A NEW ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH.

39:33.125 --> 39:34.250
- YOU BROKE
INTO MY APARTMENT?

39:34.250 --> 39:36.542
- NO, I VERY CAREFULLY
PICKED YOUR LOCK.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.125
BY THE WAY, IT'S TIME
TO VISIT THE DENTIST.

39:38.125 --> 39:39.750
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!

39:39.750 --> 39:41.041
- HEY, IT'S NOTHING
PERSONAL.

39:41.041 --> 39:42.542
I JUST CAN'T HAVE YOU
MESSING WITH MY LIFE.

39:42.542 --> 39:46.041
- FUCK YOU!

39:46.041 --> 39:48.375
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

39:48.375 --> 39:50.041
I'M GONNA RUIN YOUR--

39:50.041 --> 39:51.583
[grunts]

39:54.917 --> 39:57.041
- HANNAH.

39:57.041 --> 39:57.875
- GOD, WHAT HAPPENED?

39:57.875 --> 40:01.041
- CALL 911.

40:06.875 --> 40:08.500
- 911, WHAT IS
YOUR EMERGENCY?

40:08.500 --> 40:11.291
- I NEED AN AMBULANCE
AT 8240 PALM TERRACE.

40:11.291 --> 40:12.875
APARTMENT 10.

40:22.917 --> 40:25.375
- SO I CAME IN
TO SEE IF DEXTER WAS OKAY,

40:25.375 --> 40:27.917
AND I SAW THAT GUY
ON THE FLOOR.

40:27.917 --> 40:30.208
UH, DEXTER TOLD ME
TO CALL 911,

40:30.208 --> 40:31.458
AND HE STARTED CPR.

40:31.458 --> 40:32.959
- DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING
BEFORE THE CRASH?

40:32.959 --> 40:34.917
- THERE WAS SOME SHOUTING.

40:34.917 --> 40:36.000
KINDA LIKE AN ARGUMENT.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.083
- DEXTER'S VOICE?

40:37.083 --> 40:39.834
- MM, I DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE THE VOICE.

40:39.834 --> 40:43.417
- I ADMINISTERED CPR
UNTIL THE PARAMEDICS SHOWED UP,

40:43.417 --> 40:45.333
BUT HE WAS UNRESPONSIVE.

40:45.333 --> 40:47.083
- OKAY, DEX.
I THINK IT'S ALL HERE.

40:47.083 --> 40:51.917
- HEY, WERE YOU AND PRICE
ARGUING BEFORE HE COLLAPSED?

40:51.917 --> 40:53.792
- THE INTERVIEW MIGHT HAVE
GOTTEN A LITTLE HEATED.

40:53.792 --> 40:54.917
- HOW HEATED?

40:54.917 --> 40:56.375
- [sighing]
HE ACCUSED ME

40:56.375 --> 40:59.166
OF SLOPPY WORK
ON THE WAYNE RANDALL CASE.

40:59.166 --> 41:01.709
I MIGHT HAVE
RAISED MY VOICE A LITTLE.

41:01.709 --> 41:04.208
THAT'S ALL.

41:04.208 --> 41:06.125
- A CONTUSION
TO THE HEAD.

41:06.125 --> 41:07.291
THE SOURCE
OF ALL THE BLOOD.

41:07.291 --> 41:08.792
BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO KILL A MAN.

41:08.792 --> 41:10.917
- OKAY, JUST WAIT
FOR THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

41:10.917 --> 41:12.959
TO GET HERE, OKAY?

41:29.208 --> 41:31.417
- WHY ALL THE BLOOD, DEX?

41:31.417 --> 41:33.792
- HIS HEAD STRUCK THE TABLE
AS HE FELL.

41:33.792 --> 41:35.959
- JESUS.

41:35.959 --> 41:38.834
- YOU OKAY?

41:38.834 --> 41:41.458
- NO, I'M NOT OKAY.

41:41.458 --> 41:42.750
- I CAN'T EVEN
HAVE A DRINK WITH SOMEONE

41:42.750 --> 41:43.667
WITHOUT THEM DYING.

41:43.667 --> 41:46.333
- YOU HAD A DRINK WITH HIM?
- YEAH.

41:46.333 --> 41:48.834
HE WAS NICE, YOU KNOW?
I LIKED HIM.

41:48.834 --> 41:51.458
- DID PRICE TELL DEB
ABOUT ME AND HANNAH?

41:51.458 --> 41:52.458
DOUBTFUL.

41:52.458 --> 41:54.125
DEB WOULD HAVE ALREADY
BROUGHT IT UP.

41:54.125 --> 41:55.166
- I CAN'T BELIEVE--

41:55.166 --> 41:56.166
- I'M SORRY, DEB.

41:56.166 --> 41:57.709
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

41:57.709 --> 41:58.792
- I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

41:58.792 --> 42:01.667
HANNAH MCKAY.

42:01.667 --> 42:03.542
SHE KILLED PRICE.

42:03.542 --> 42:05.625
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?
- HE WAS CONVINCED THAT

42:05.625 --> 42:07.375
SHE STABBED ONE OF THE VICTIMS
ON THE SPREE.

42:07.375 --> 42:08.542
AND THAT SHE
KEPT ON KILLING.

42:08.542 --> 42:10.750
HER HUSBAND, OTHER PEOPLE.

42:10.750 --> 42:13.375
ALL WITH POISON. HE WAS GONNA
PUT IT IN HIS BOOK.

42:13.375 --> 42:16.041
SHE POISONED PRICE.

42:16.041 --> 42:18.875
IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.

42:18.875 --> 42:20.000
- HOW WOULD SHE
PULL THAT OFF?

42:20.000 --> 42:22.583
- I DON'T KNOW.

42:22.583 --> 42:23.583
BUT I'M GONNA PICK HER UP
FOR QUESTIONING.

42:23.583 --> 42:28.458
I'M GONNA RUN A TOX SCREEN
ON HIS BODY.

42:28.458 --> 42:29.959
SHE'S NOT GONNA
GET AWAY WITH IT.

42:29.959 --> 42:33.041
NOT THIS TIME.

42:44.333 --> 42:45.709
- HANNAH MUST KNOW
THAT PRICE'S BODY

42:45.709 --> 42:48.709
WILL BE TESTED FOR POISON.

42:48.709 --> 42:50.625
SO WHY ISN'T SHE CONCERNED?

42:50.625 --> 42:53.583
OR IS SHE JUST THAT GOOD
AT HIDING IT?

43:04.375 --> 43:06.542
- MRS. MCKAY,
I'M LIEUTENANT MORGAN.

43:06.542 --> 43:08.291
DO YOU WANT ANYTHING
BEFORE WE GET STARTED?

43:08.291 --> 43:09.750
A WATER?
COFFEE?

43:09.750 --> 43:12.792
- UH, JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

43:12.792 --> 43:14.417
- OKAY.

43:14.417 --> 43:16.834
SAL PRICE IS DEAD.

43:16.834 --> 43:18.041
- OH, MY GOD.

43:18.041 --> 43:19.750
- SHE IS THAT GOOD.

43:19.750 --> 43:21.417
- UH, WHAT HAPPENED?

43:21.417 --> 43:24.333
- I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD TELL ME THAT.

43:24.333 --> 43:26.166
- HOW CAN I DO THAT?

43:26.166 --> 43:27.583
- MS. MCKAY,
I WAS REALLY HOPING

43:27.583 --> 43:28.792
THAT WE COULD
CUT THROUGH THE CRAP.

43:28.792 --> 43:31.000
SAL PRICE WAS
WRITING A BOOK ON YOU.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.583
YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT,
SO YOU POISONED HIM.

43:33.583 --> 43:36.417
- THAT'S CRAZY.

43:36.417 --> 43:38.792
- YOU'RE A KILLER,
MS. MCKAY.

43:38.792 --> 43:40.583
YOU'RE A FUCKING GOOD ONE,
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

43:40.583 --> 43:42.917
YOU'VE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT
FOR A LONG TIME.

43:42.917 --> 43:46.000
BUT I HAVE A BLOOD REPORT
ON BEVERLY GREY

43:46.000 --> 43:48.041
THAT PROVES SHE WAS KILLED
BY A PLANT

43:48.041 --> 43:50.166
THAT GROWS
ON YOUR PROPERTY.

43:50.166 --> 43:52.959
AND I HAVE A FORENSICS REPORT
ON THE WAYNE RANDALL BODIES

43:52.959 --> 43:55.750
THAT PROVE THAT YOU STABBED
ONE OF THEIR VICTIMS TO DEATH.

43:57.625 --> 43:59.917
- I'M NOT EVEN SURE
WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT.

43:59.917 --> 44:02.583
I HAVE IMMUNITY
FOR THE WAYNE RANDALL KILLINGS.

44:02.583 --> 44:03.792
- RIGHT,

44:03.792 --> 44:06.667
AND THE BEVERLY GREY EVIDENCE
IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

44:06.667 --> 44:09.166
UNLESS I CAN TIE IT TO
THE POISONS THAT I'M GONNA FIND

44:09.166 --> 44:11.875
IN THE TOX SCREEN THAT
I JUST ORDERED FOR SAL PRICE.

44:11.875 --> 44:15.458
THAT IS GONNA NAIL
YOUR FUCKING ASS TO THE FLOOR.

44:15.458 --> 44:16.834
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO SAL.

44:16.834 --> 44:19.083
- NO. HE JUST DROPPED DEAD
OF A HEART ATTACK.

44:19.083 --> 44:20.083
- SOMETIMES
PEOPLE DIE.

44:20.083 --> 44:21.709
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT THEY WERE POISONED.

44:21.709 --> 44:24.917
- IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HUSBAND?

44:24.917 --> 44:26.125
DID HE JUST DIE?

44:26.125 --> 44:28.792
ALONG WITH
YOUR UNBORN BABY?

44:28.792 --> 44:30.166
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED,
MS. MCKAY?

44:30.166 --> 44:32.291
WAS HE PRESSURING YOU
TO HAVE A FAMILY?

44:32.291 --> 44:34.458
WAS IT MAKING YOU
FEEL TRAPPED?

44:36.208 --> 44:39.500
- SHE'S NOT ACTING.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.667
- CHARGE ME WITH SOMETHING,
OR LET ME GO.

44:41.667 --> 44:44.041
- I AM TRYING TO GIVE YOU
AN OPPORTUNITY

44:44.041 --> 44:47.500
TO COME CLEAN
ABOUT SAL PRICE.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.583
YOU'LL BE DOING YOURSELF
A BIG FAVOR

44:48.583 --> 44:50.208
WHEN YOUR CASE
COMES TO TRIAL.

44:50.208 --> 44:51.542
- AM I DONE HERE?
- YEAH. YOU'RE DONE.

44:51.542 --> 44:53.625
TRUST ME.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.208
- YOU KNOW, MY GRANDMA
HAS THIS SAYING.

44:58.208 --> 45:01.500
"TRUST THOSE WHO
SEEK THE TRUTH,

45:01.500 --> 45:04.625
"BUT DOUBT THOSE WHO SAY
THAT THEY HAVE FOUND IT."

45:06.333 --> 45:08.500
MY GRANDMA
WASN'T EVER WRONG.

45:22.875 --> 45:24.834
- HANNAH SURVIVED
DEB'S QUESTIONING,

45:24.834 --> 45:27.959
BUT SHE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT
THROUGH MINE.

45:27.959 --> 45:29.500
[forceful knocking on door]

45:35.667 --> 45:37.375
- PRICE WAS GOING
TO DESTROY MY LIFE.

45:37.375 --> 45:38.542
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

45:38.542 --> 45:40.417
- I TOLD YOU
I WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT.

45:40.417 --> 45:42.667
- WELL, YOU WEREN'T EXACTLY
GIVING ME PROGRESS REPORTS.

45:42.667 --> 45:44.917
I SAW A CHANCE
AND I TOOK IT.

45:47.041 --> 45:48.583
I WAS DOING IT
FOR YOU TOO.

45:48.583 --> 45:51.041
- FOR ME?
HE DIED IN MY APARTMENT!

45:53.125 --> 45:55.542
MY LIVING ROOM
IS A CRIME SCENE.

45:55.542 --> 45:58.083
YOU KNOW WHO I AM, WHAT THAT
MEANS TO SOMEONE LIKE ME.

45:58.083 --> 46:00.208
- I FIGURED IT WOULD KICK IN
WHILE PRICE WAS ON THE ROAD,

46:00.208 --> 46:03.208
A CONVENIENT
AUTO ACCIDENT.

46:05.166 --> 46:07.500
- HOW'D YOU DO IT?

46:07.500 --> 46:08.917
- IS IT REALLY
IMPORTANT?

46:08.917 --> 46:10.500
- IS LIFE IN PRISON
IMPORTANT?

46:10.500 --> 46:13.417
- I'M NEVER
GOING TO PRISON.

46:15.709 --> 46:18.834
PRICE LIKED TO CHEW
ON HIS PENS.

46:18.834 --> 46:20.542
THE LAST ONE HAD
A LITTLE SOMETHING ON IT,

46:20.542 --> 46:21.583
COMPLETELY UNDETECTABLE.

46:21.583 --> 46:22.625
- YOU BETTER HOPE SO.

46:22.625 --> 46:25.625
- I KNOW SO.

46:25.625 --> 46:28.917
JUST WISH I COULD'VE DESTROYED
PRICE'S BOOK ALONG WITH HIM.

46:28.917 --> 46:30.875
[sighs]

46:33.208 --> 46:36.291
- ACTUALLY,
I TOOK CARE OF PRICE'S BOOK.

46:36.291 --> 46:39.041
- YOU WHAT?

46:39.041 --> 46:41.834
HOW?

46:41.834 --> 46:44.417
- I WAS AT HIS APARTMENT,

46:44.417 --> 46:45.959
COLLECTING DNA SAMPLES

46:45.959 --> 46:50.458
FOR MY NOW-DEFUNCT PLAN
TO GET HIM TO SHUT UP,

46:50.458 --> 46:53.417
AND I ERASED
HIS RESEARCH ON YOU.

46:56.458 --> 46:57.417
- THANKS.

46:57.417 --> 47:01.917
- IT ONLY TOOK A MINUTE.

47:01.917 --> 47:06.166
- I COULD FEEL YOU WATCHING ME
WHILE I WAS BEING INTERROGATED.

47:07.625 --> 47:09.291
YOU SAW THE WHOLE THING,
DIDN'T YOU?

47:09.291 --> 47:12.000
- IS IT TRUE
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND?

47:12.000 --> 47:14.458
DID YOU KILL HIM BECAUSE YOU
DIDN'T WANT A FAMILY?

47:14.458 --> 47:15.667
- IT WAS THE OPPOSITE.

47:15.667 --> 47:20.000
I WANTED A FAMILY,
AND HE DIDN'T.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.458
HE THREATENED TO LEAVE ME
UNLESS I GOT AN ABORTION.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.500
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BABY?

47:28.500 --> 47:31.625
- IT WAS
A MISCARRIAGE.

47:33.041 --> 47:35.959
SOMETIMES LIFE SUBTRACTS.

47:38.417 --> 47:40.959
SOMETIMES IT ADDS.

47:42.709 --> 47:44.792
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT HAPPENED?

47:44.792 --> 47:47.709
WE WERE LOOKING OUT
FOR EACH OTHER.

47:49.792 --> 47:52.458
THAT'S BIG
FOR PEOPLE LIKE US,

47:52.458 --> 47:54.875
MAYBE EVEN HISTORIC.

48:44.458 --> 48:46.083
- WHAT'S THIS?

48:46.083 --> 48:47.125
- FOR YOUR RESTAURANT.

48:47.125 --> 48:48.750
- IT'S 10 GRAND.
- YOU KNOW I GOT

48:48.750 --> 48:50.417
THAT INHERITANCE
A WHILE BACK.

48:50.417 --> 48:52.083
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR
THE RIGHT PLACE TO INVEST.

48:52.083 --> 48:53.417
- I CAN'T TAKE THIS.
WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY?

48:53.417 --> 48:55.375
- WHY, YOU TOO GOOD
FOR MY FUCKING MONEY?

48:55.375 --> 48:57.375
- NO, THIS IS
WAY TOO GENEROUS.

48:57.375 --> 48:58.709
- BULLSHIT.
IT'S FAMILY MONEY.

48:58.709 --> 49:01.375
YOU'RE FAMILY TO ME.
- QUINN--

49:01.375 --> 49:04.917
- LOOK, YOU'RE STUCK WITH IT.
I'M NOT TAKING IT BACK.

49:06.500 --> 49:09.458
I DO EXPECT
A FEW FREE MEALS, THOUGH.

49:12.458 --> 49:14.291
- THIS IS A LOAN,
YOU ASSHOLE.

49:14.291 --> 49:15.709
I'M GONNA PAY YOU BACK.

49:15.709 --> 49:18.625
- OKAY, BIG GUY.
WE'RE GOOD.

49:30.458 --> 49:31.834
[knocking at the door]

49:33.083 --> 49:37.083
- REPORT'S BACK
ON THE TOX SCREEN ON SAL PRICE.

49:37.083 --> 49:39.417
- THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.

49:39.417 --> 49:42.083
M.E. RAN IT TWICE.
NEGATIVE BOTH TIMES.

49:46.375 --> 49:49.417
- THAT FUCKING BITCH IS GONNA
GET AWAY WITH IT AGAIN.

50:19.166 --> 50:20.625
- [over recorder]
WAYNE WAS YELLING

50:20.625 --> 50:22.000
FOR ME
TO GET HER OFF HIM,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.542
SO I GRABBED HER BY THE HAIR
AND I PULLED HER TO THE BED,

50:24.542 --> 50:30.834
AND--AND SHE JUST--SHE JUST
KEPT SCREAMING AND SCREAMING

50:30.834 --> 50:34.834
[sobbing] SO I--
I STABBED HER,

50:34.834 --> 50:39.667
AND SHE JUST KEPT SCREAMING
AND THERE WAS SO MUCH BLOOD.

50:39.667 --> 50:41.625
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

50:41.625 --> 50:46.417
- [sobbing] I STABBED HER
UNTIL THE SCREAMING STOPPED.

50:46.417 --> 50:48.542
[sobs]

50:56.417 --> 50:57.875
- NOT ONLY
CAN'T I KILL HER,

50:57.875 --> 50:59.375
I CAN'T SEEM
TO STAY AWAY FROM HER.

50:59.375 --> 51:04.458
EVEN WHEN I'M NOT WITH HANNAH,
SHE'S THERE, IN MY HEAD.

51:04.458 --> 51:06.041
WHEN SOME ELEMENTS
COME TOGETHER,

51:06.041 --> 51:09.166
THEY CREATE A REACTION
THAT CAN'T BE REVERSED.

51:09.166 --> 51:11.709
THEY TRANSCEND
CHEMISTRY.

51:11.709 --> 51:16.166
IS THIS
WHAT LOVE FEELS LIKE?

51:16.166 --> 51:19.125
IS THIS HOW IT BEGINS?

51:19.125 --> 51:20.917
AM I EVEN CAPABLE OF THIS?

51:20.917 --> 51:27.291
[phone buzzing]

51:30.291 --> 51:31.166
HELLO?

51:31.166 --> 51:34.750
- HANNAH MCKAY
KILLED SAL PRICE,

51:34.750 --> 51:37.917
AND SHE'S GONNA WALK.

51:37.917 --> 51:40.083
SHE'S GONNA
GET AWAY WITH IT,

51:40.083 --> 51:43.291
AND WE BOTH KNOW
SHE'S GONNA KILL AGAIN.

51:45.792 --> 51:48.417
- DEB, CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS
IN THE MORNING?

51:48.417 --> 51:52.709
- HE DIDN'T DESERVE
TO DIE.

51:52.709 --> 51:55.583
I CAN'T
LET THIS HAPPEN.

51:55.583 --> 51:58.542
THERE HAS TO BE
SOME FUCKING JUSTICE.

52:01.583 --> 52:03.709
IT'S YOU, DEX.

52:03.709 --> 52:07.125
- ME?

52:07.125 --> 52:10.125
- YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?

52:10.125 --> 52:14.959
SHE DESERVES IT.

52:14.959 --> 52:16.792
I WANT YOU
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

52:18.834 --> 52:21.917
DO WHAT YOU DO.
