WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:07.741
Dunder Miflin,
this is Pam.

00:07.775 --> 00:11.145
Sure, can I ask
who's calling?

00:11.179 --> 00:13.781
Just a second.

00:15.749 --> 00:16.717
Jim Halpert.

00:16.750 --> 00:17.751
What?

00:17.785 --> 00:19.653
How did you get
this number?

00:19.687 --> 00:21.755
Stalker.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.157
Katie and Jim
met in the office.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.393
And now I guess
they're, like, going out

00:25.426 --> 00:27.161
or dating or something.

00:27.195 --> 00:30.131
And, uh...

00:30.164 --> 00:31.765
I don't know, you know?

00:31.799 --> 00:35.236
They're just--she calls him
and they...you know.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.338
I'm sorry, I feel like
I'm talking really loud.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.506
Am I talking really loud?

00:38.539 --> 00:39.607
So we're still on
for lunch?

00:39.640 --> 00:41.142
You're meeting me here?

00:41.175 --> 00:42.610
Okay.

00:42.643 --> 00:46.280
Great.
Bye.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.681
Hey.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.650
You can just give her
your extension.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.119
Okay.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.521
Howard/Ryan.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.590
Ryan Howard is sitting
in my office.

01:29.623 --> 01:32.126
And he has been a temp here
for a couple of months.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.895
And he's kind of gotten
the lay of the land

01:34.928 --> 01:36.430
a little bit.

01:36.464 --> 01:37.698
A few laughs
along the way.

01:37.731 --> 01:41.235
And now he wants to know
what I think.

01:41.269 --> 01:44.772
The temp agency
wants to know what you think.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.408
Shall we?
Let us proceed.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.311
First up, proficiency
in necessary skills.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.882
Eeeeeeaaa....

01:54.915 --> 01:58.552
Excellent!

02:01.655 --> 02:03.757
Michael's in there right now
evaluating the temp.

02:03.791 --> 02:07.795
He hasn't evaluated me
in years.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.797
Five years from now,
what do you wanna do?

02:09.830 --> 02:12.800
Where do you wanna be?
Uh, well, I'm interested
in business.

02:12.833 --> 02:13.801
Oh, good.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.637
Ambitious.
Excellent.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.406
Wanna be a manager?

02:18.439 --> 02:20.508
Uh, no, actually
what I want is to own

02:20.541 --> 02:21.609
my own company.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.812
That is ridiculous.

02:24.845 --> 02:25.713
Ryan's about to attend

02:25.746 --> 02:28.682
the Michael Scott
school of business.

02:28.716 --> 02:32.486
I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda
rolled into one.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.590
Much advice you seek.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.658
You know who that is?

02:39.660 --> 02:41.295
Fozzy Bear?

02:44.798 --> 02:47.301
No, that was Yoda.

02:47.335 --> 02:50.538
There are ten rules of business
that you need to learn.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.840
Number one...

02:54.742 --> 02:57.445
You need to play to win...

02:57.478 --> 03:03.684
but you also have to win
to play.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.687
Got it.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.859
And I will give you
the rest of the ten at lunch.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.330
Hey, tch tch.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.769
Michael and I have
a very special connection.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.971
He's like Batman,
I'm like Robin.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.707
He's like The Lone Ranger,
and I'm like Tonto.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.642
And it's not like there was
The Lone Ranger

03:28.676 --> 03:30.678
and Tonto and Bonto.

03:41.922 --> 03:42.890
People!

03:42.923 --> 03:43.891
Okay!
Everybody?

03:43.924 --> 03:45.259
This is not a test!

03:45.293 --> 03:46.560
Go to the exits!

03:46.594 --> 03:47.695
Do not panic!

03:47.728 --> 03:49.530
Get up off your desks!

03:49.563 --> 03:50.731
Do not panic!

03:52.466 --> 03:53.634
This is not a drill!

03:53.667 --> 03:56.337
Arms at your side!
Arms at your side!

03:56.370 --> 03:58.272
This is a paper company,
people!

03:58.306 --> 04:00.007
Step lively!

04:00.040 --> 04:01.742
This whole place
is a tinderbox.

04:01.775 --> 04:02.776
It is ready to blow.

04:05.779 --> 04:06.980
This is not a test!

04:07.014 --> 04:07.981
Can you leave?

04:08.015 --> 04:08.982
Oh, you say that
every time.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.651
Do you wanna die?!

04:10.684 --> 04:12.486
Do you wanna die?!

04:12.520 --> 04:13.721
Out!

04:13.754 --> 04:15.923
Stanley, have you ever seen
a burn victim?

04:15.956 --> 04:17.491
Move to the exits!

04:17.525 --> 04:18.492
You're safety partners!

04:18.526 --> 04:20.561
Real smoke!
We've got smoke!

04:20.594 --> 04:22.696
Smoke!

04:25.499 --> 04:26.734
God!

04:36.844 --> 04:38.612
Oh, Kelly!
Are you okay?

04:38.646 --> 04:39.613
I gotcha!

04:39.647 --> 04:40.781
Hey!
Get off me!

04:40.814 --> 04:42.015
Get the
off of me!

04:42.049 --> 04:43.016
Breathe through your nose.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.386
Remove your stockings!
Okay?

04:45.419 --> 04:46.687
They'll melt
right into your flesh!

04:46.720 --> 04:48.822
Stay below
the smoke line.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.360
Let's go!
Clear out, stat!

04:52.393 --> 04:54.762
Stop means now!

04:56.464 --> 04:58.532
Yes, I was the
first one out.

04:58.566 --> 05:01.435
And, yes, I've heard
women and children first.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.937
But we do not
employ children.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.907
We are not a sweatshop,
thankfully.

05:06.940 --> 05:12.079
And women are equal
in the workplace by law.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.548
So, I let them out first,

05:14.582 --> 05:16.850
I have a lawsuit
on my hands.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.886
Another rule of business...

05:18.919 --> 05:21.054
is being able to adapt
to different situations.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.890
Yeah?

05:22.923 --> 05:26.660
Adapt, react, readapt...

05:26.694 --> 05:28.496
Apt.
Right?

05:28.529 --> 05:29.497
That's rule number two.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.330
Okay!

05:30.364 --> 05:31.865
Guys, listen up,
we need a headcount.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.401
Okay, we need a countoff.
Michael's number one.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.435
Where is he?
Where is he?

05:34.468 --> 05:36.069
So what was rule two?

05:36.103 --> 05:38.038
Uh, adapt, react,
readapt, apt.

05:38.071 --> 05:38.972
Okay, well, let's...

05:39.006 --> 05:40.741
Let's just kind of take it
a little slower.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.143
Hey, Michael, uh, Ryan needs
a number for the countoff.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.646
Okay, uh,
well, one is taken.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.647
Uh, okay, two?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.382
No!
Okay--uh, sorry.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.383
Okay, he can have 14.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.951
Margery's not here today.

05:50.984 --> 05:51.952
Well, he needs
a permanent number, all right?

05:51.985 --> 05:53.387
No, I don't.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.321
Oh, you know what else?

05:54.354 --> 05:55.989
I thought of a nickname
for the three of us.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.458
Three musketeers.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.660
Um, yeah, okay.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.795
That--no no no no!
I got one, I got one.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.597
The three stooges.

06:03.631 --> 06:04.998
That's funny, too, but if we're
the three musketeers...

06:05.032 --> 06:08.969
I don't wanna be,
like, a guy here, you know?

06:09.002 --> 06:11.772
Like, Stanley is the
crossword puzzle guy.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.807
And Angela has cats.

06:13.841 --> 06:17.545
I don't wanna
have a thing here, you know?

06:17.578 --> 06:21.014
I don't wanna be
the something guy.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.116
Okay, you know what?

06:23.150 --> 06:26.019
I think I'm gonna be
setting the agenda here, okay?

06:26.053 --> 06:27.020
Can everybody gather up, please.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.155
Important announcement.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.022
Very important
announcement.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.725
I think this is
a perfect opportunity

06:31.759 --> 06:33.994
for all of us
to participate

06:34.027 --> 06:36.564
in some really intense

06:36.597 --> 06:38.031
psychologically revealing
conversations.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.768
So we're gonna be playing
Desert Island...

06:40.801 --> 06:42.970
um, "Who Would You Do?"

06:43.003 --> 06:44.672
And, um...

06:44.705 --> 06:45.673
"Would You Rather?"

06:45.706 --> 06:47.040
"Would You Rather?"

06:47.074 --> 06:48.108
"Would You Rather?"
is our third game.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.917
Yeah!

06:56.950 --> 06:58.719
Hey, what's going on, man?
How are ya?

06:58.752 --> 06:59.953
Long time no see.
Yeah, I know, right?

06:59.987 --> 07:03.824
Hey, guys,
great response time.

07:03.857 --> 07:06.026
Listen up.
I got some theories.

07:06.059 --> 07:06.994
There's a...

07:07.027 --> 07:10.698
Okay, so, three books
on a desert island.

07:10.731 --> 07:11.732
Angela.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.566
The Bible.

07:15.035 --> 07:19.206
That's one book.
You've got two others.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.207
Purpose Driven Life.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.042
Nice.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.544
Third book.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.578
No.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.214
Okay!
Phyllis.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.649
Um, The Da Vinci Code.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.050
The Da Vinci Code.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.552
I would take
The Da Vinci Code.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.220
So I could burn
The Da Vinci code.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.788
Okay, great, that's gonna
keep you warm

07:34.822 --> 07:36.757
for, like, seven seconds.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.859
Question, is there firewood
on the island?

07:38.892 --> 07:40.060
I guess.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.995
Then I would bring an axe.
No books.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.765
No, it has to be a book,
Dwight.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.200
Fine.
Physician's Desk Reference.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.268
Nice.
Smart.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.570
Hollowed out.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.271
Inside, waterproof matches,

07:51.304 --> 07:54.107
iodine tablets.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.976
Beet seeds, protein bars,
NASA blanket.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.879
And...

07:58.912 --> 07:59.847
in case I get bored,

07:59.880 --> 08:02.049
Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.685
No, Harry Potter
and the prisoner of Azkaban.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.254
Question, did my shoes
come off in the plane crash?

08:07.287 --> 08:10.958
Rule number four
in business.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.894
Image is everything.
Andre Agassi.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.096
This car is
an investment, right?

08:16.129 --> 08:18.632
If I have to take out
a client.

08:18.666 --> 08:23.136
Or I'm seen
around Scranton in it.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.806
I love it.
I love this car.

08:28.075 --> 08:31.044
Do you like it?

08:31.078 --> 08:32.179
Yeah.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.282
Okay, I thought people
read more books.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.150
DVDs. Five movies.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.151
What would you bring
to the island.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.553
Yes, Meredith.

08:39.587 --> 08:42.189
Legends of the Fall,
My Big Fat Greek Wedding,

08:42.222 --> 08:44.892
Legally Blonde,
Bridges of Madison County.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.326
Wow.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.261
Legends of the Fall.
Wow.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.564
Bridges of Madison County,
Legally Blonde.

08:50.598 --> 08:51.632
These movies are just--

08:51.665 --> 08:52.700
Well, I kind of like...

08:52.733 --> 08:54.868
Wait, wait, wait.
Pam, no.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.037
Do you understand?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.239
The game is
desert island movies,

08:59.272 --> 09:00.340
not guilty pleasure movies.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.610
Desert island movies are
the movies you're gonna watch

09:02.643 --> 09:06.313
for the rest of your life!
Forever!

09:06.346 --> 09:07.581
Unforgivable.
I take it back.

09:07.615 --> 09:08.649
Unforgivable.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.050
I take it back!
Good.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.719
And Ghost.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.887
But, uh, just that
one scene.

09:16.990 --> 09:17.791
Is this your car, Ryan?

09:17.825 --> 09:20.260
Wow, some pretty big books
back there.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.228
Good shocks.

09:21.261 --> 09:24.231
Hello, Mr. Egghead.
Beep!

09:24.264 --> 09:26.033
Oh, Stanley Kaplan,
I know him.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.736
M is for murder.
P is for...

09:28.769 --> 09:30.237
That's actually
a test prep book.
What?

09:30.270 --> 09:33.040
That's a test prep
for business school.

09:33.073 --> 09:33.941
Oh, thinking about
business school.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.108
I just got in.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.109
I applied.
I go at night.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.110
Really?

09:37.144 --> 09:38.979
So you think you know
a lot about business?

09:39.012 --> 09:40.748
No, not yet.
Just started.

09:40.781 --> 09:41.949
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.651
Quiz me.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.653
I wouldn't even know--
Oh, come on.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.955
Come on, Egghead.
Let's do it.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.222
Quiz me up.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.691
All right.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.926
Um, why have people been
rethinking

09:52.960 --> 09:56.063
the Microsoft model
in the past few years?

10:00.400 --> 10:01.835
When I was Ryan's age,

10:01.869 --> 10:03.971
I worked
in a fast food restaurant

10:04.004 --> 10:06.106
to save up money
for school.

10:06.139 --> 10:09.977
And then I lost it
in a pyramid scheme.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.245
But I learned more
about business

10:12.279 --> 10:14.314
right then and there

10:14.347 --> 10:15.849
than business school
would ever teach me.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.384
Or Ryan would ever
teach me.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.420
Is it cheaper to sign
a new customer

10:20.453 --> 10:22.322
or to keep
an existing customer?

10:22.355 --> 10:23.390
Keep an existing--

10:23.423 --> 10:24.958
Shut...it.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.960
Can I just
do it please?

10:26.994 --> 10:28.996
Uh, it's equal.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.198
It is ten times more expensive
to sign a new customer.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.266
Okay, yes.
It was a trick question.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.735
Yeah, but look.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.036
I mean, he didn't need
business school, okay?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.370
Michael comes from
the school of hard knocks.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.371
Okay, Dwight?
Self-taught.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.372
You didn't even
go to college.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.708
You know what?

10:40.741 --> 10:42.075
You don't need
to help me here, okay?

10:42.109 --> 10:43.844
You know, maybe you should
go to business school

10:43.877 --> 10:45.078
like Ryan.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.915
Then you'd know what
you're talking about.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.416
You're studying
with the master, huh?

10:49.449 --> 10:51.151
You should learn
from him, right?

10:51.184 --> 10:52.686
Right?

10:52.720 --> 10:54.087
Stop.
You know what, Dwight?

10:54.121 --> 10:55.388
You're acting like a dork.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.957
Would you cool it, please?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.992
Okay.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.161
Hey, he's not your
five year old brother, Dwight.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.097
He's a valued member
of this company.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.132
And you know what?

11:05.165 --> 11:08.001
He knows more about business
than you ever will.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.305
Stupid.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.841
I did not go
to business school.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.242
You know who else
didn't go to business school?

11:15.275 --> 11:18.045
LeBron James,
Tracy McGrady.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.279
Kobe Bryant.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.214
They went right from
high school to the NBA.

11:21.248 --> 11:25.285
So...

11:25.318 --> 11:28.956
So it's not
the same thing at all.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.490
Look at this stuff.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.993
Market fragments,
what is that supposed to be?

11:33.026 --> 11:34.728
It's a way of looking
at consumers as subsets

11:34.762 --> 11:36.196
of a larger client base.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.299
You are so smart.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.902
You are so f-ing smart.

11:41.935 --> 11:45.105
You should
be teaching me.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.040
Pam, get us
back into it.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.475
Five movies, go ahead.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.878
Okay, um, Fargo.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.446
Um, Edward Scissorhands,
Dazed and Confused.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.514
Ooh, definitely
in my top five.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.483
Yes, in my top three,
so suck it.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.019
Breakfast Club.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.221
Um, The Princess Bride.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.289
Okay, that's five.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.024
No!
My all time favorite!

12:04.057 --> 12:05.192
Pam, play by the rules.
Play by the rules.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.526
All time favorite.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.096
Dwight!

12:09.129 --> 12:12.199
All time favorite movie.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.304
The Crow.

12:17.337 --> 12:22.242
I became a salesman
because of people.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.111
I love making friends.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.980
But then I was promoted
to manager

12:27.014 --> 12:30.283
at a very young age.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.019
And I still try
to be a friend first.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.956
But, you know...

12:35.989 --> 12:37.290
When you're very successful,

12:37.324 --> 12:40.093
your co-workers
look at you differently.

12:45.132 --> 12:48.836
Ah, what do you think?

12:48.869 --> 12:51.104
Maybe we should
get some air.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.574
No, I'm okay.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.111
I'm really uncomfortable.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.147
All right, let's move on.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.849
Let's move on
to the main event.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.116
Who would you do?

13:03.150 --> 13:05.018
Present company excluded?

13:05.052 --> 13:06.019
Um, not necessarily.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.487
Pam.
Pam.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.957
Um...

13:09.990 --> 13:11.591
Okay, you know what?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.160
Maybe I'll finish
explaining the rules.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.462
Let me explain it first
and then...

13:15.495 --> 13:20.167
[REM's Everybody Hurts
playing out of Dwight's car]

13:20.200 --> 13:21.468
Yeah, so we'll get right--
you know what?

13:21.501 --> 13:23.403
I'll be right back.
Stanley.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.537
You're taking over
for me, buddy.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.538
I'll be right back.

13:25.572 --> 13:26.573
Okay.
Um...

13:30.110 --> 13:32.579
Dwight.
Dwight.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.950
Come on, Dwight,
use words.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.387
Why didn't I go
to business school?

13:40.420 --> 13:41.488
Who goes to business school?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.023
The temp.
He does?

13:43.056 --> 13:44.624
Yeah, it's all him
and Michael talk about anymore.

13:44.657 --> 13:48.461
You know,
I bet Ryan thinks to himself,

13:48.495 --> 13:51.031
"I wish I were a volunteer
Sheriff on the weekend."

13:51.064 --> 13:53.000
He doesn't even know
that I do that.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.634
You should tell him.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.004
Oh, yeah, Pam.
Right.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.472
That's gonna help things,
just talk it out.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.142
I hope the war goes on forever
and Ryan gets drafted.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.143
Dwight.
What?

14:03.176 --> 14:04.211
I'm sorry I said that.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.979
I didn't...

14:06.013 --> 14:08.181
Just part of me
meant it.

14:08.215 --> 14:12.185
Besides, he'd end up being
a hero, anyway.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.887
You know what
you should do.

14:13.921 --> 14:16.523
You should quit.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.526
And then, that would
stick it to both of them.

14:19.559 --> 14:23.563
No, Jim,
I'm not gonna quit.

14:23.596 --> 14:26.133
Then Ryan wins.
Yeah, you're right.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.236
Thanks, you guys.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.971
I just need
some alone time.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.639
Okay.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.214

14:41.248 --> 14:42.215
Nothin'.
Hey!

14:42.249 --> 14:43.951
What's up?

14:43.984 --> 14:45.185
Can I hang with you guys
for a bit?

14:45.218 --> 14:46.453
The warehouse guys are...

14:46.486 --> 14:47.487
a bunch of jackasses
sometimes.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.622
Come on, people,
you know the rules of the game.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.158
Oh, hey, hey, game?

14:51.191 --> 14:53.093
What game
are we playing here?

14:53.126 --> 14:55.195
Okay, it's called
"Who Would You Do?"

14:55.228 --> 14:56.663
Oh!

14:56.696 --> 14:59.066
I play this at home
all the time

14:59.099 --> 15:00.633

Where are we here?

Roy?

15:05.105 --> 15:07.174
Who would you do, Roy?

15:07.207 --> 15:09.576
Uh...
Oh, I got it!

15:09.609 --> 15:13.413
What's the name of that
tight

15:13.446 --> 15:14.414
The blond?

15:14.447 --> 15:15.983
My name is Angela.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.518
Hey, Angela, Roy.
Nice to meet you.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.353
All right, who's next?
Who's next?

Who's next?
Who's

You're next.
Who would you do?

15:24.524 --> 15:29.129
Um, Kevin, hands down.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.463
Yeah.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.599
He's really got that
teddy bear thing going on.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.968
Afterwards we could
just watch bowling.

15:37.237 --> 15:43.076
Well, I would definitely
have sex with Ryan.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.077
'Cause he is gonna
own his own business.

No, I can talk, I can talk.
I can talk.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.655
Well, wish I had
my cell phone,

15:55.688 --> 15:57.024
but I left it inside, so...

15:57.057 --> 15:58.425
Would that make you happy?

15:58.458 --> 15:59.626
What's that?
If you had your cell phone?

15:59.659 --> 16:00.693
Would it make you happy?
Yeah.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.062
I'm on it.

Dwight.
Hey!

16:03.163 --> 16:04.197
You can't go
back in yet!

16:04.231 --> 16:05.198
Dwight!

16:05.232 --> 16:06.099
He is an idiot.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.068
The man is an idiot,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.703
What if he dies
in the fire?

16:10.737 --> 16:13.373
And that's the last thing
you ever said to him?

16:13.406 --> 16:16.343
I didn't say it to him,
I said it about him.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.714

Definitely Jim.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.683
Definitely, definitely Jim.

anybody else?

Oh, good.

where the hell is Dwight?

for him to find.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.195
What's your number?

17:08.228 --> 17:09.629
I gave it to you
in the car.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.598
Um...

I saw you
program it in.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.403
You gotta--you gotta
give it to me again.

17:16.436 --> 17:21.208
All right.

Everyone, okay.
Uh...

I have an announcement.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.441
Apparently,
in business school,

17:54.474 --> 17:56.209
they don't teach you
how to operate

left his cheese pita
on oven

for the toaster thing!

Oh, wow!
Okay.

how to operate

Uh, for the desert island.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.632
Oh, right!
Right right right!

19:25.665 --> 19:26.866
Come on, come on.

19:26.899 --> 19:27.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather 'round.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.302
We have one more
participant.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.937
Come on, be polite.
Be polite.

19:30.970 --> 19:34.307
Desert island,
five movies, go.

19:34.341 --> 19:38.745
Okay, um, first,
Legally Blonde.

19:40.980 --> 19:45.352
I forgot what
a super nice girl Katie is.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.986
And, just--good for Jim.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.888
They are so cute together.

19:48.921 --> 19:52.925
And, um,
what an adorable car!

19:52.959 --> 19:55.362
Okay!

19:55.395 --> 19:56.496
I think the game's over.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.297
People are, like, leaving.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.931
There was
a bigger crowd last time.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.233
Do you wanna
just go to lunch?

20:00.267 --> 20:01.234
Okay, all right.
Yeah?

20:01.268 --> 20:02.235
You wanna drive?
Sure.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.803
All right.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.580
They are so cute.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.014
I'm really sorry, Dwight.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.683
Answer me this, though.
What?

20:16.716 --> 20:19.352
Was it worth it?
Was it worth it, temp?

20:19.386 --> 20:20.587
No.
Really?

20:20.620 --> 20:21.754
I'm really sorry, Dwight.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.990
The fire guy!
The fire guy!

20:24.023 --> 20:26.759
* Joe McCarthy Richard Nixon
Studebaker television *

20:26.793 --> 20:28.895
* North Korea South Korea
Marilyn Monroe *

20:28.928 --> 20:30.997
* Ryan started the fire

20:31.030 --> 20:34.401
Okay, rule five,
safety first,

20:34.434 --> 20:37.837
i.e. don't burn the
building down, okay?

20:37.870 --> 20:38.938
That should be
a no-brainer.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.873
Oh, look...

20:40.907 --> 20:44.477
Ryan is book smart.

20:44.511 --> 20:47.046
And I am street smart.

20:47.079 --> 20:47.980
And book smart.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.750
I'll give you
the rest of the ten tomorrow.
