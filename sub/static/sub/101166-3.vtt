But we weren't getting clear evidence

We just knew that we had a lot
of concrete companies

But we didn't know anything
about how it worked.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.029
The whole idea was to figure out
if the Commission,

05:21.112 --> 05:23.072

05:23.156 --> 05:24.991

One of the things we noticed
is Ralph Scopo,

who's not a boss,
he's not a capo, he's not an underboss,

05:52.643 --> 05:53.770

He's at the table
when they're talking about

05:56.272 --> 05:59.400
these controversial conversations
over construction.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.668
I knew Ralph well. Ralph Scopo
was actually one of my father's guys.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.463
I liked him.
Early on, I called him Uncle Ralph.

06:20.546 --> 06:21.756
I grew up with him.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.093
He was only a soldier,

06:25.593 --> 06:27.512
but, you know, here's the thing.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.389
If you had a soldier

06:29.472 --> 06:31.349
that was making
a tremendous amount of money

06:31.432 --> 06:34.977
and had a lot of influence,
he could be a powerful guy too,

06:35.603 --> 06:37.980
because he had a lot of authority
in his own right,

06:38.064 --> 06:39.941
because of what
he meant to the family.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.944
Ralphie Scopo was that guy.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.739
[Joyce] We discovered Ralph Scopo

06:46.823 --> 06:51.661
was the President of the District Council
of the Cement and Concrete Workers Union.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.997
It was clear to us, at that point,

06:55.081 --> 06:57.959
that Ralph Scopo was a key player.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.919
And our surveillance shifted

07:00.002 --> 07:03.131
from the Casa Storta restaurant
to Ralph Scopo.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.559
[Joyce] He would go into his office.
He'd be in there for about an hour.

07:14.642 --> 07:17.854
And then, like clockwork,
he would go back to his car.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.023
The contractor would drive up,
get out of his car,

07:21.107 --> 07:23.609
jump in Ralphie's car,
and they would talk.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.905
Clearly, he did not trust his office.

He says, "There's eight... companies
that participate in the club.

12:55.024 --> 12:58.235
Each of those companies
is connected with a Mob family.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.613
Anything over two million

13:00.696 --> 13:04.033
was gonna be allocated
to those eight companies,

13:04.116 --> 13:06.118

13:08.621 --> 13:12.208
It's fixed. It's fixed.
Everything is fixed from the beginning.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.085
Everybody knows who's allocated what job.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.755
Let's say its value
is really eight million.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.841
They would put in their bid
for ten million,

13:20.925 --> 13:24.762
and all the other companies will put in
a bid higher than the ten million,

13:25.346 --> 13:27.139
thereby guaranteeing

13:27.223 --> 13:29.850
that they would get
the job for ten million,

13:29.934 --> 13:32.770
when it really only had a value
of about eight million.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.940
So they were making a couple
of extra million dollars on a job.

13:37.608 --> 13:40.569
And so with all these
extra millions of dollars,

13:40.653 --> 13:42.905
it was going
into the pockets of Mob families

13:42.988 --> 13:44.490

15:41.273 --> 15:44.109
[Joyce] We're literally talking
a billion-dollar operation.

15:44.610 --> 15:48.322
[man]<i> The deal was 400-plus.</i>
<i>You gotta put it behind you.</i>

15:48.405 --> 15:51.075
[overlapping distorted chatter]

15:51.158 --> 15:54.578
[man] <i>How does the Bronx zoo sound?</i>
<i>Aqueduct Racetrack, Belmont, the Coliseum?</i>

15:54.662 --> 15:57.456
[man 2] <i>The first part of the job</i>
<i>is 4.8 million...</i>

16:04.421 --> 16:07.967
The concrete club has to have been
one of the most audacious schemes

16:08.050 --> 16:09.802
that the Mob ever pulled off.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.764
But we can't just win this trial

16:13.847 --> 16:17.309
by proving that there's something
called the "concrete club" alone.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.646
To prove a RICO case,

16:20.729 --> 16:25.567
we've gotta connect that Commission
to a series of other underlying crimes.

16:27.277 --> 16:30.280
So, to show that they're
utterly terrifying people,

16:30.364 --> 16:35.369
we thought that it would be great
if we could have something more violent,

16:35.452 --> 16:36.662
more gripping,

16:36.745 --> 16:40.874
more, you know, sort of really
grabbing your attention

16:40.958 --> 16:42.376
and grabbing the jury's attention.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.254
We were gonna prove a murder.

16:50.926 --> 16:54.179
[Chertoff] The FBI were assigned
two agents to be the case agents.

16:54.263 --> 16:59.101
The idea was they would be the main point
of contact between the prosecutorial team

16:59.184 --> 17:00.269
and the FBI.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.939
One was Pat Marshall
and one was Charlotte Lang.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.486
[Lang] When I got there,
the FBI was very male-dominated.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.780
I think it was 97 percent male.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.825
The supervisor said to me,

17:14.908 --> 17:18.078
"I didn't ask for you. I don't think women

17:18.162 --> 17:20.205
can work organized crime."

17:20.289 --> 17:23.125
He said, "You'll be the only woman
on the squad." And I was.

17:23.208 --> 17:27.504
And I thought this must be,
"Hi, welcome to New York!"

17:28.088 --> 17:30.132
But then the supervisor told me

17:30.215 --> 17:33.594
that he was going to assign me
to work with Pat.

17:33.677 --> 17:36.764
I would describe Pat Marshall as...

17:37.514 --> 17:40.601
the big brother that anybody
would want to have.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.356
[Marshall] Charlotte was a former
school teacher, very well-organized.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.401
She was my right-hand woman, my friend.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.570
What I couldn't figure out, she could.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.280
We work very, very well together.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.408
It was our responsibility,

17:56.492 --> 17:58.118
Charlotte's and mine,

17:58.202 --> 18:02.164
to prove the Commission
had authorized murder.

18:03.957 --> 18:04.792
So...

18:06.919 --> 18:08.295
how are we gonna prove it?

18:14.343 --> 18:17.763
[Chertoff] There was a murder
we certainly had good reason to believe

18:17.846 --> 18:19.473
was a Commission-ordered hit:

18:19.556 --> 18:21.558
the famous murder of Carmine Galante.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.268
[typewriter clacking]

18:32.236 --> 18:36.615
<i>Carmine Galante was rubbed out today</i>
<i>as he sat in a Brooklyn luncheonette,</i>

18:36.698 --> 18:39.284
<i>a gangland execution</i>
<i>of a man believed to be</i>

18:39.368 --> 18:42.746
<i>the most important organized crime</i>
<i>figure in the country.</i>

18:42.830 --> 18:45.249
<i>Two other people in the luncheonette</i>
<i>died as well.</i>

18:45.332 --> 18:47.501
<i>Brian Ross has the gory details.</i>

18:48.252 --> 18:50.087
[Ross] <i>Galante was having lunch</i>
<i>in the courtyard</i>

18:50.170 --> 18:51.839
<i>of an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn</i>

18:51.922 --> 18:54.508
<i>when five men entered</i>
<i>with automatic rifles and shotguns</i>

18:54.591 --> 18:55.634
<i>and opened fire.</i>

18:55.717 --> 18:58.846
<i>Galante and two other men</i>
<i>at his table were killed.</i>

19:00.055 --> 19:02.182
[Chertoff]
Carmine Galante was a Sicilian mobster

19:02.266 --> 19:05.853
who rose to ultimately control
what was the Bonanno family.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.898
Now, there was a lot
of informant information

19:09.982 --> 19:12.985
that to kill a boss, you needed
the permission of the Commission.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.488
[Ross]
<i>Galante was resented by other Mafia bosses</i>

19:16.572 --> 19:19.366
<i>because he received so much</i>
<i>attention and publicity,</i>

19:19.449 --> 19:21.201
<i>and because he had been too rough </i>

19:21.285 --> 19:24.413
<i>in his efforts to become the top man</i>
<i>in the American Mafia.</i>

19:26.874 --> 19:29.042
[Lang] When Carmine Galante was murdered

19:29.126 --> 19:32.379
at Joe and Mary's Restaurant
in '79 in Brooklyn,

19:32.462 --> 19:34.631
the other four heads of the family

19:34.715 --> 19:37.259
would've had to agree to that murder.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.762
We had to prove that the Commission,

19:40.846 --> 19:42.347
the other four Mob bosses,

19:42.431 --> 19:44.266
okayed the killing of Galante.

19:48.312 --> 19:51.690
[Lang] I spent an afternoon with
the medical examiner in New York then,

19:51.773 --> 19:54.860
and he showed me the autopsy photos.

19:54.943 --> 19:59.239
Carmine Galante had 84
exit and entrance wounds in his body.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.786
Five people participated in that shooting.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.584
[Chertoff]
There was a lot of informant information

20:10.667 --> 20:14.421
that one of the shooters
was a guy named Anthony Indelicato.

20:15.714 --> 20:19.176
The problem is you can't use
informant information in court.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.844
So how do you prove the case?

20:22.429 --> 20:25.599
[Childers] Bruno Indelicato,
real name Anthony Indelicato,

20:25.682 --> 20:27.559
was a soldier in the Bonanno family,

20:27.643 --> 20:30.604
who, shortly after the murder
of Carmine Galante,

20:30.687 --> 20:32.856
was elevated to the rank of captain.

20:33.982 --> 20:38.153
Bruno was a wild guy
known to be sort of a loose cannon,

20:38.237 --> 20:40.906
someone you would
look to for violent crime.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.951
When the car pulled away,

20:44.034 --> 20:46.912
there was a woman across the street
in an apartment

20:46.995 --> 20:48.372
who heard the shots,

20:48.455 --> 20:51.166
saw the car, and wrote down
the license plate number.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.126
She gave it to the police.

20:53.210 --> 20:56.546
The police, within a day or so,
found the car abandoned,

20:56.630 --> 20:58.882
and they took fingerprints
off the steering wheel,

20:58.966 --> 21:00.050
where the driver was,

21:00.133 --> 21:05.180
and also fingerprints off
the rear door handle in the back seat.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.725
[Childers] Indelicato's fingerprints
were compared

21:08.809 --> 21:11.144
against the latent print
on the door handle.

21:12.646 --> 21:13.480
No match.

21:14.856 --> 21:19.528
It was run against everyone who could be
thought of as a possible suspect.

21:22.614 --> 21:23.782
There was no hits.

21:26.952 --> 21:31.039
With no fingerprint hit,
there wasn't anywhere else to go.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.917
[traffic sounds]

21:38.255 --> 21:41.967
[Childers] Now, fast-forward to 1984,
we had the idea:

21:42.050 --> 21:45.053
redo every piece
of the investigation, essentially.

21:47.055 --> 21:49.433
I don't believe the car
was around anymore.

21:49.516 --> 21:50.934
But that door handle,

21:51.018 --> 21:54.604
that metal door handle,
had been removed from the car

21:54.688 --> 21:56.398
and was still in police custody.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.152
We went to the evidence vault
to check it out.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.867
When you look at the door handle,
you realize,

22:06.950 --> 22:09.619
it's not your fingers that would touch
where the print is,

22:09.703 --> 22:11.288
but it's actually your palm.

22:12.289 --> 22:16.460
And so... that's when... it was realized

22:16.543 --> 22:19.921
that we need to start running
palm prints against these.

22:20.464 --> 22:23.925
Indelicato's palm print
was not in police custody.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.220
The fingerprint cards they had for him
didn't include his palm print.

22:34.102 --> 22:35.687
[Lang] I had to look for Bruno.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.440
We were able to identify,

22:38.523 --> 22:41.193
I think through source information,
about this girlfriend.

22:41.276 --> 22:45.113
And she was expected at this clinic
on a particular day.

22:49.034 --> 22:53.830
We sat there all day waiting, hopefully,
for Bruno to show up with the girlfriend.

22:56.666 --> 22:59.961
Of course, they do show up
like three minutes before it's gonna close

23:00.045 --> 23:01.671
after sitting there all day.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.423
So we arrest Bruno.

23:03.507 --> 23:07.761
Instead of... just doing the fingerprints,
we did the whole hand.

23:07.844 --> 23:09.304
It's called a major case print.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.641
We had an FBI agent
that was an expert and could determine...

23:13.809 --> 23:16.645
did his fingerprints, palm prints match?

23:19.314 --> 23:20.190
[line rings]

23:20.273 --> 23:21.149
[phone rings]

23:21.233 --> 23:24.277
[Lang] I can still remember Pat--
We were sitting in the squad area

23:24.361 --> 23:25.445
and his phone rang.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.531
[ringing]

23:29.032 --> 23:30.534
And he turned around and he said,

23:30.617 --> 23:33.495
-"It's Bruno's palm print."
-Bingo.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.873
One hundred percent match.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.500
He was one of the shooters.

23:40.919 --> 23:44.256
[Chertoff] That was
very, very good evidence

23:44.339 --> 23:46.299
against Indelicato for murder.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.802
Now we needed to connect that up,

23:49.386 --> 23:51.847
to show the Commission had ordered it.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.561
[Childers] It just so happened,
on the day of the murder,

23:57.644 --> 24:01.022
there was video surveillance
being done on a social club...

24:01.982 --> 24:04.818
in Little Italy,
a place called the Ravenite Social Club.

24:06.153 --> 24:09.489
What we had was somewhat unusual
on that tape.

24:11.533 --> 24:15.203
Approximately half an hour
after the murder,

24:15.287 --> 24:17.539
there is this incredible meeting.

24:24.671 --> 24:28.258
Indelicato and a couple of other people
show up.

24:29.926 --> 24:32.929
They are in a very energized state.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.643
[Marshall] The surveillance tape
at the Ravenite Social Club

24:38.727 --> 24:41.938
shows Indelicato wearing an open shirt,

24:42.814 --> 24:45.775
and then everybody congratulates
one another, hugging and kissing.

24:50.655 --> 24:54.868
[Lang] So here you have a Bonanno member,
on the day that the boss is killed,

24:54.951 --> 24:59.164
going over and being congratulated
by the underboss of the Gambino family.

25:03.793 --> 25:06.546
[Chertoff] Once you prove
that Indelicato was a shooter,

25:06.630 --> 25:11.468
the fact that he goes to the boss
of another family to be congratulated

25:11.551 --> 25:16.056
is very powerful evidence that in fact
the Commission did order the murder,

25:16.139 --> 25:19.184
as the rules required them to do.

25:20.977 --> 25:24.356
[Giuliani] This was tremendous evidence.
We were getting very close.

25:24.439 --> 25:26.691
I knew what I would need
to indict Commission,

25:26.775 --> 25:28.902
and I became obsessive-compulsive
about it.

25:28.985 --> 25:31.696
I always felt like the pinnacle
of the case would be

25:31.780 --> 25:33.448
proof of a Commission meeting.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.658
That's what we needed.

25:37.702 --> 25:40.580
Nobody had ever taken
surveillance photographs

25:40.664 --> 25:42.791
of a Commission meeting before.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.460
[ship's horn blows in distance]

25:45.544 --> 25:48.088
[O'Brien] It was May 15, 1984.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.841
I got a call in the morning
from my informant saying,

25:51.925 --> 25:56.012
"There's gonna be a Commission meeting."
I didn't believe him. This was unheard of.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.180
I said, "Yeah right."

25:57.806 --> 26:00.058
He goes, "No, all of the bosses
are gonna be there.

26:00.141 --> 26:03.270
They're gonna be talking about
this concrete club they had going."

26:03.353 --> 26:07.440
I said, "Alright, if I make a fool
of myself, it's your ass."

26:16.616 --> 26:18.285
The bosses of the crime families

26:18.368 --> 26:21.454
couldn't afford to get caught
meeting together.

26:21.538 --> 26:24.374
They would reconnoiter the area
looking for vehicles,

26:24.457 --> 26:25.500
and if they did...

26:26.251 --> 26:29.838
they would detect the surveillance team.
They would call it off.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.926
So the plan was, if the meeting
is gonna be at one o'clock,

26:35.010 --> 26:36.386
we're gonna set up at two o'clock.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.805
Don't have to get 'em going in.
We can get 'em coming out.

26:40.890 --> 26:43.602
I was sitting in the passenger's side
of the van I had rented.

26:43.685 --> 26:45.770
Andy was seated behind me.

26:45.854 --> 26:49.524
He had a 300 millimeter lens,
which he had on my shoulder.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.609
[barking]

26:53.486 --> 26:55.864
We sat there, an hour...

26:56.531 --> 26:57.490
two hours.

27:03.079 --> 27:06.374
Andy was starting to doubt they were
in there. I said, "They're in there."

27:11.129 --> 27:13.423
And all of a sudden, we got 'em...

27:13.506 --> 27:14.341
[shutter snaps]

27:17.135 --> 27:18.678
[O'Brien] Fat Tony Salerno,

27:19.304 --> 27:21.389
head of the Genovese family.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.143
Andy was using my shoulder like a tripod,

27:26.770 --> 27:28.438
and I didn't even wanna breathe.

27:28.521 --> 27:30.357
I'm hearing the click, click, click…

27:30.440 --> 27:31.399
[click]

27:31.483 --> 27:33.151
...of Tony "Ducks" Corallo.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.695
I was afraid to even move.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.489
He might get a blurry photograph.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.076
Gennaro Langella,

27:41.159 --> 27:43.536
acting boss of the Colombo family,

27:47.207 --> 27:50.085
and then Paul Castellano,
the boss of bosses.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.258
They're coming out family by family.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.511
This is historic.

28:00.053 --> 28:03.098
This is a Commission meeting,
right in front of our eyes, unfolding.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.852
They've got all these tapes,
but they don't have a meeting.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.270
This is a meeting.

28:09.354 --> 28:12.357
This was the final thing they needed,
these photographs.

28:20.615 --> 28:22.617
[traffic sounds]

28:23.952 --> 28:25.954
[thunder rumbles]

28:28.915 --> 28:31.543
[Kossler] There came a point in time
where we had enough evidence

28:31.626 --> 28:33.128
to prosecute all the bosses.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.590
[phone line ringing]

28:41.636 --> 28:42.887
[Kossler] The decision was made,

28:42.971 --> 28:45.724
that we would make the arrest
the following morning.

28:49.644 --> 28:50.937
[phone ringing]

28:51.020 --> 28:53.106
I was sitting in my office.

28:53.189 --> 28:54.190
We get a call.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.361
It was NBC News.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.238
NBC News said they know

29:00.321 --> 29:01.781
that we are going to arrest

29:01.865 --> 29:04.701
the bosses of all the Five Families
the next morning.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.330
So they're gonna announce that
on the evening news.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.124
[overlapping chatter]

29:11.207 --> 29:12.834
So this was like six o'clock at night,

29:12.917 --> 29:15.628
and the evening news
was gonna be coming on any minute now.

29:15.712 --> 29:16.755
[woman] Ten seconds.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.590
[Kossler]
And I knew that once that happened,

29:19.257 --> 29:21.468
those folks that were to be arrested

29:21.551 --> 29:23.052
would be in the wind.

29:23.136 --> 29:26.556
So I told my bosses, I said,
"I think we gotta go right now!"

29:30.101 --> 29:33.646
[woman] <i>In seven, six, five...</i>

29:33.730 --> 29:34.814
[man] <i>Rollers.</i>

29:34.898 --> 29:37.567
[woman] Stand by, chyrons. Insert.

29:37.984 --> 29:41.196
It was a very high honor
to be sent out to arrest the most...

29:41.738 --> 29:45.325
powerful mobster in America
on the most serious of charges.

29:45.408 --> 29:48.536
Three, two, one...

29:50.246 --> 29:52.290
[announcer] <i>This is NBC Nightly News.</i>

29:53.625 --> 29:57.086
Paul Castellano was having dinner.
His family was there.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.589
[announcer]
<i>This is NBC Nightly News</i> <i>in New York.</i>

30:01.883 --> 30:04.803
Told him we had a warrant
for his arrest on RICO charges.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.012
Had to bring him in.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.848
He said, "Can I get dressed first?"

30:08.932 --> 30:09.891
"Sure."

30:10.558 --> 30:13.019
When he was ready to go,
he put his hands out to be handcuffed.

30:13.102 --> 30:15.104
I said, "Oh,
you don't have to handcuff him."

30:16.189 --> 30:18.900
And, as we were driving in,
we had the radio on,

30:19.526 --> 30:22.070
and then it came out on the radio.
Breaking news.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.321
[radio squawks]

30:23.404 --> 30:25.031
[man] <i>There's a major roundup underway</i>

30:25.114 --> 30:27.742
<i>of top leaders in organized crime</i>
<i>in our area. Top leaders.</i>

30:28.201 --> 30:29.911
<i>First time ever, the reputed...</i>

30:29.994 --> 30:31.704
[O'Brien]
And he leaned forward to hear it.

30:31.788 --> 30:32.914
And then they said,

30:32.997 --> 30:35.041
"Paul Castellano, the boss of bosses,

30:35.124 --> 30:36.626
was also taken into custody,

30:36.709 --> 30:38.461
from the information from the case

30:38.545 --> 30:40.672
that was developed
from bugs in his house."

30:42.841 --> 30:44.092
That's when he found out,

30:44.175 --> 30:45.844
by listening to the radio,

30:45.927 --> 30:47.971
that we had put a bug in his house.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.848
So he goes, "You bugged my house!"

30:51.683 --> 30:53.226
And it was kind of awkward.

30:53.309 --> 30:55.854
I just kind of looked the other way,
you know.

30:55.937 --> 30:58.982
I said, "Hey, you know,
that's the game we play."

30:59.065 --> 31:00.900
[upbeat music playing]

31:00.984 --> 31:03.278
[man] <i>From WNBC-TV,</i>

31:03.361 --> 31:08.616

31:09.617 --> 31:10.577
<i>Good evening.</i>

31:10.660 --> 31:15.373
Tony Ducks, Big Paul,
Fat Tony, Gerry Lang, Rusty Rastelli.

31:15.456 --> 31:16.791
A godfather roundup!

31:23.423 --> 31:25.925
[DeVecchio] How often do you
send out agents to arrest every boss

31:26.009 --> 31:29.220
in an organized crime family?
That was an exciting day in the office,

31:29.304 --> 31:32.348
to see all these guys
get arrested and brought in.

31:32.432 --> 31:35.018
Maybe once in a lifetime
you have that happen.

31:35.101 --> 31:36.227
Authorities call this

31:36.311 --> 31:39.898
the most important prosecution case
ever brought against organized crime.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.774
[Franzese] It was sensational.

31:41.858 --> 31:44.777
All the bosses,
carted away at the same time.

31:44.861 --> 31:46.195
It was a day that I won't forget.

31:46.279 --> 31:49.949
People wouldn't even dream about this,
you know, ten years before.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.702
And here we were
in the middle of making history.

31:52.785 --> 31:55.496
The Mafia leaders were rounded up
in an overnight sweep.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.958
And today, US attorney Rudolph Giuliani
announced the indictments.

31:59.459 --> 32:03.671
This is a great day for law enforcement,
but this is a bad day, probably the worst,

32:03.755 --> 32:04.631
for the Mafia.

32:04.714 --> 32:07.967
[Franzese] I felt terrible.
I knew Fat Tony, I liked him a lot.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.971
[reporter] <i>And tonight a man</i>
<i>identified as Ralph Scopo...</i>

32:12.055 --> 32:14.140
[Franzese]
Ralphie Scopo, I knew Ralphie well.

32:14.223 --> 32:15.391
I grew up with him.

32:15.475 --> 32:18.186
[Giuliani] This case charges
more Mafia bosses,

32:18.269 --> 32:20.396
in one indictment, than any ever before.

32:20.480 --> 32:24.108
[overlapping chatter]

32:24.192 --> 32:26.194
[Alite] When that RICO case
first got announced,

32:26.277 --> 32:28.738
we were cursing out
Rudy Giuliani like crazy.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.824
We don't even know
what they were talking about at the time,

32:31.908 --> 32:34.160
'cause we didn't understand the law.
It was very technical.

32:34.243 --> 32:36.287
There're a couple of Mob guys
who went to the hospital

32:36.371 --> 32:38.539
thinking they were
gonna get indicted... [laughs]

32:38.623 --> 32:39.999
...that we didn't name.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.250
Everybody was worried.

32:41.334 --> 32:44.379
All of a sudden, every gangster
that couldn't count to ten

32:44.462 --> 32:47.131
started trying to understand
what RICO meant.

32:48.716 --> 32:52.011
We realized this is a law
that enables the FBI

32:52.095 --> 32:57.225
to gather multiple members
of the Mob together in a conspiracy case.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.561
So anybody that was from the street

33:00.645 --> 33:02.855
really understood what RICO meant to us,

33:02.939 --> 33:05.733
and especially to our bosses
of the five families.

33:05.817 --> 33:09.404
At least two of them, I know,
will be able to post bail immediately.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.949
-[reporter] Is Castellano one of them?
-Castellano, yeah, and Fat Tony.

33:18.538 --> 33:21.165
[man] I was
Fat Tony Salerno's defense lawyer.

33:21.791 --> 33:24.210
At the time we met, I was 34.

33:24.293 --> 33:28.381
I was a little bit intimidated
to meet with Mr. Salerno,

33:28.923 --> 33:32.719
kind of afraid
to ask him certain questions,

33:32.802 --> 33:35.930
because maybe the answers
were something that, uh...

33:36.014 --> 33:39.267
he didn't either want to tell me,
or maybe I shouldn't know.

33:39.809 --> 33:42.395
Um... And... he once stopped me,

33:42.478 --> 33:43.604
'cause he sensed that,

33:43.688 --> 33:46.733
and he said, "Listen kid,
you can ask me any question you want,

33:46.816 --> 33:48.943
and I will always,
always tell you the truth.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.737
Some questions you're gonna ask me,

33:50.820 --> 33:53.656
I won't be able to answer,
and I'll tell you I can't answer that.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.784
You take it for whatever
it means at that point,

33:56.868 --> 33:58.828
but don't ever be
afraid to ask me a question.

33:58.911 --> 34:02.290
[reporter] I asked Fat Tony if he had
anything to say about all this.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.125
You have something to say, Tony?

34:06.085 --> 34:06.919
[reporter]<i> Thank you.</i>

34:08.129 --> 34:09.047
[reporter] Excuse me.

34:09.130 --> 34:11.466
[Cardinale]
Fat Tony was a very kind person...

34:12.091 --> 34:12.925
to me.

34:13.468 --> 34:15.887
<i>Here comes Marcy.</i>
<i>I want you to meet her.</i>

34:15.970 --> 34:18.473
[woman]
<i>Introducing the new Cabbage Patch babies,</i>

34:18.556 --> 34:20.558
<i>the littlest Cabbage Patch kids of all.</i>

34:20.641 --> 34:23.936
[Cardinale] My daughter was
about two years old at the time.

34:24.020 --> 34:28.649
There was a doll that was very famous
called the Cabbage Patch doll,

34:28.733 --> 34:31.235
and it was sold out everywhere,

34:31.319 --> 34:33.905
and my daughter desperately wanted one.

34:34.781 --> 34:37.116
Can't remember how he found that out,

34:37.200 --> 34:39.660
but the next thing you know,
he sent a case...

34:40.244 --> 34:43.414
of Cabbage Patch dolls to my daughter.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.208
[jingle playing]

34:45.291 --> 34:48.252
[man] <i>Cabbage Patch Kids babies,</i>
<i>with everything shown here.</i>

34:48.336 --> 34:50.171
<i>Each sold separately from Coleco.</i>

34:51.672 --> 34:53.591
[man] <i>Castellano left</i>
<i>the federal courthouse</i>

34:53.674 --> 34:54.967
<i>in Lower Manhattan tonight</i>

34:55.051 --> 34:57.428
<i>after posting</i>
<i>two million dollars bail money.</i>

34:58.763 --> 35:00.431
[Giuliani] Paul Castellano walked out,

35:00.515 --> 35:04.435
and this reporter from <i>60 Minutes </i>came up
to him, introduced himself and said,

35:04.519 --> 35:07.188
"We'd like to put you on <i>60 Minutes,</i>
Mr. Castellano.

35:07.271 --> 35:10.525
People have to hear that Giuliani
isn't the only word on this."

35:10.608 --> 35:12.777
And Castellano went
and reached in his pocket.

35:12.860 --> 35:15.655
"I'll be glad to talk to you.
Here's my card. Talk to my lawyer."

35:15.738 --> 35:17.198
He acted like a businessman.

35:17.990 --> 35:19.283
Fat Tony walks out of court.

35:21.577 --> 35:24.872
Fat Tony was <i>fat...</i>
looked like a Mafia guy.

35:24.956 --> 35:28.292
First thing he does when he gets out
of court is... puts a cigar in his mouth.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.627
[imitates match igniting]

35:29.710 --> 35:31.462
The guy comes up to him,
says the same thing.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.464
He says, "You're a reporter?

35:35.424 --> 35:36.634
Then go F yourself.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.928
Just go F yourself,
I don't talk to no reporters."

35:39.011 --> 35:41.848
And he walks off.<i> </i>[chuckles]
It was a difference between two men.

35:41.931 --> 35:45.768
One was totally pretentious,
and Fat Tony knew exactly who he was.

35:52.024 --> 35:55.528
[Cardinale] One of the things
that came across in representing Fat Tony

35:55.611 --> 35:59.824
was the notion that this group
was essentially its own government.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.996
They did not play by the rules of the--

36:05.079 --> 36:08.374
what the, say,
United States government rules were.

36:08.457 --> 36:11.085
They had
their own law and order and justice.

36:11.919 --> 36:13.462
And that's what they live by.

36:30.229 --> 36:32.648
[reporter] <i>It happened</i> <i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the evening rush hour</i>

36:32.732 --> 36:34.525
<i>on a crowded Midtown street.</i>

36:35.318 --> 36:37.278
I was sitting in my office,

36:37.361 --> 36:38.863
at the US Attorney's Office,

36:38.946 --> 36:42.491
writing the government's response
to a variety of motions.

36:43.451 --> 36:47.538
[reporter] <i>Two men were apparently shot,</i>
<i>either getting into or leaving the car.</i>

36:48.623 --> 36:51.292
I happened to be playing
in a basketball game.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.295
[reporter] <i>One of the men appeared</i>
<i>to have been a driver.</i>

36:54.378 --> 36:56.964
<i>The keys were only several inches</i>
<i>from his hand</i>

36:57.715 --> 36:59.550
All of a sudden,
our beepers were going off.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.136
My secretary walks in and hands me a note.

37:02.678 --> 37:04.931
[reporter] <i>Both men appear</i>
<i>to have been shot in the head,</i>

37:05.014 --> 37:08.476
<i>shot gangland execution-style</i>
<i>on the street.</i>

37:08.559 --> 37:12.271
I remember one of my colleagues
running down the hall saying,

37:12.355 --> 37:14.357
"Big Paulie was just whacked!"

37:16.150 --> 37:16.984
Shit.

37:25.743 --> 37:28.663
[reporter] <i>It is a historic event</i>
<i>in the history of the Mob.</i>

37:28.746 --> 37:31.958
<i>You are looking</i>
<i>at the body of Paul Castellano.</i>

37:33.960 --> 37:36.170
[Kossler]
We got into cars and drove up there.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.129
It was mayhem.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.423
There were people everywhere,
all over the street.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.508
The street was closed.

37:41.217 --> 37:44.095
Castellano's body was laying
with his head in the gutter.

37:44.178 --> 37:46.722
This was really significant in that he was

37:46.806 --> 37:49.976
the boss of one
of the largest families in the Mafia.

37:51.936 --> 37:55.022
[reporter] <i>Witnesses said that Castellano</i>
<i>was sitting in his limousine</i>

37:55.106 --> 37:59.819
<i>when three men in trench coats walked up,</i>
<i>started shooting,</i> <i>and they made a getaway.</i>

38:02.613 --> 38:04.991
The atmosphere was very tense.

38:06.659 --> 38:08.536
I knew it was coming, for a while.

38:11.747 --> 38:14.792
Castellano's rule is, like most bosses,

38:14.875 --> 38:16.168
don't deal drugs.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.255
If I find out about it,

38:19.338 --> 38:21.424
you're gonna be killed for dealing drugs.

38:23.259 --> 38:26.095
Angelo Ruggiero, John Gotti, and myself

38:26.178 --> 38:27.471
were all moving drugs.

38:29.348 --> 38:32.059
Angelo Ruggiero and John Gotti realized

38:32.143 --> 38:35.104
that Angelo had been caught on hours

38:35.187 --> 38:38.858
and dozens of wiretaps in his house,

38:38.941 --> 38:40.651
discussing the drug business.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.198
In our life, in the Mob world,

38:46.282 --> 38:50.036
when you, uh... break a rule,
your life is ended like that.

38:50.119 --> 38:51.454
[static]

39:05.176 --> 39:07.553
[Alite] Gotti and Ruggiero understand

39:07.636 --> 39:10.890
that if Castellano
is in those tapes at the trial,

39:11.474 --> 39:12.308
they're dead.

39:12.391 --> 39:13.309
[tape deck clicks]

39:15.144 --> 39:16.562
They had to hit him first.

39:16.645 --> 39:18.814
Law enforcement officials
are wondering this morning

39:18.898 --> 39:21.567
whether the murder of the country's
top Mob boss Monday

39:21.650 --> 39:24.028
was the first salvo
in a new gangland war.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.989
And they're looking
for this man, John Gotti.

39:35.915 --> 39:39.585
[O'Brien] I felt bad
because the whole object of my case

39:39.668 --> 39:41.545
was to put Castellano away.

39:44.548 --> 39:47.385
There's a strange bond
that sometimes exists

39:47.468 --> 39:50.596
between law enforcement officers
and criminals.

39:52.348 --> 39:56.352
They both live
by codes of honor and respect

39:56.435 --> 39:58.771
more stringent than most normal people.

39:58.854 --> 40:01.690
And there's
a certain psychological connection there.

40:03.275 --> 40:06.612
I heard him on the mic for 600 hours,

40:06.695 --> 40:08.572
for a four, five-year period.

40:08.656 --> 40:09.990
I felt like I knew him.

40:10.574 --> 40:14.245
It wasn't supposed to end this way.
He's supposed to end up in federal prison.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.252
[DeVecchio] It was frustrating
to learn he had been killed

40:21.335 --> 40:24.588
just for the reason that...
he was the boss of bosses.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.551
I would much rather have seen
Castellano convicted,

40:28.634 --> 40:30.219
rather than ending it that way.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.974
Paul Castellano was
a very, very important defendant to us.

40:35.057 --> 40:39.061
We had fantastic tapes
from his kitchen in Staten Island.

40:39.145 --> 40:41.480
He was a reigning boss,

40:41.564 --> 40:44.942
and we very much wanted him
to be a defendant at trial.

40:45.025 --> 40:46.861
So it was both a shock,

40:46.944 --> 40:48.737
and in some ways frustrating,

40:48.821 --> 40:51.532
that we did not have a chance
to bring him to justice.

40:53.325 --> 40:57.371
It certainly increased the pressure
on all of us as a trial team,

40:57.455 --> 41:00.749
because the press and the whole country
were watching New York.

41:04.670 --> 41:07.715
Tonight we begin
with an <i>NBC News </i>exclusive.

41:07.798 --> 41:11.093
The godfathers of the New York Mafia
are in big trouble.

41:11.177 --> 41:15.306
This was billed as probably
the biggest organized crime case ever.

41:16.015 --> 41:18.309
The federal government
is trying to prove there are five men

41:18.392 --> 41:21.520
who were the alleged bosses
of New York City's five crime families,

41:21.604 --> 41:23.147
and they comprised a commission.

41:23.230 --> 41:26.275
They are charged with a wide range
of strong-arm tactics,

41:26.358 --> 41:30.613
including infiltration of New York City's
high-rise construction industry.

41:30.696 --> 41:34.492
This case was<i> </i>a media circus,
no question about it.

41:34.575 --> 41:37.161
Dare we hope that this is the beginning
of the end for the Mob?

41:37.244 --> 41:39.538
Hopefully, with an organization
like the Mafia,

41:39.622 --> 41:42.374
we will wear them down. I think this is
a perfect time to crush them.

41:43.417 --> 41:46.337
Rudy did rather love
being in front of the cameras.

41:46.420 --> 41:50.508
<i>Some of your critics have accused you</i>
<i>of being a publicity hound.</i>

41:50.591 --> 41:52.343
<i>Uh... How do you plead to that charge?</i>

41:52.426 --> 41:55.930
<i>I plead not guilty to the charge,</i>
<i>certainly with the way it's characterized.</i>

41:56.347 --> 41:58.474
[Savarese] Did we tease him a little bit?

41:58.557 --> 41:59.391
Sure.

41:59.475 --> 42:00.851
It was a running joke

42:00.935 --> 42:03.729
among all the assistant US attorneys.

42:03.812 --> 42:08.317
Being the the Mob buster
was a big part of his persona.

42:08.400 --> 42:12.196
<i>You can almost regard it</i>
<i>as a hidden tax.</i>

42:12.279 --> 42:15.366
[man] <i>Giuliani and other officials</i>
<i>say the tax is exacted every time...</i>

42:15.449 --> 42:18.452
[Cardinale] The government will do
whatever they can to win the case.

42:18.536 --> 42:23.707
Including in that is to make sure
the publicity permeates the public...

42:23.791 --> 42:25.668
A major racketeering trial in New York.

42:25.751 --> 42:29.088
[Cardinale] ...so that the jurors
are fully aware

42:29.171 --> 42:31.215
of the most nefarious aspects

42:31.298 --> 42:33.926
that Giuliani could put in the press.

42:34.009 --> 42:37.680
It's outrageous that that kind of thing
happens in our society

42:37.763 --> 42:39.557
[man] <i>The public</i>
<i>must understand, they say,</i>

42:39.640 --> 42:43.060
<i>that these men are gangsters and murderers</i>
<i>who steal from everyone.</i>

42:44.728 --> 42:46.939
[Childers] This clearly was
the biggest thing

42:47.022 --> 42:48.566
I would ever do professionally.

42:48.649 --> 42:50.568
[Giuliani] Young lady, let us through.

42:51.819 --> 42:55.114
So there was a certain amount of pressure.

42:56.031 --> 42:57.575
I had just turned 29.

42:58.450 --> 43:01.203
John had also just turned 29.

43:01.287 --> 43:02.663
And Mike was 30.

43:04.415 --> 43:07.084
I'm sure in some quarters,
there were people questioning,

43:07.167 --> 43:10.421
"Really? These three kids
are going to try this case?"

43:10.504 --> 43:12.214
All my guys were incredibly young.

43:12.298 --> 43:15.301
That's all you get. They don't pay
any money in the US Attorney's Office.

43:15.384 --> 43:19.179
None of us had ever tried a case
of this magnitude before.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.390
When you think about it,
it's a little crazy, right?

43:21.473 --> 43:23.225
The United States is entrusting

43:23.309 --> 43:27.563
essentially three novices
with this momentous case.

43:28.647 --> 43:29.815
And all of a sudden,

43:29.898 --> 43:34.570
we're up against
these terrifying, formidable Mob figures.

43:35.696 --> 43:38.157
[reporter] Are you confident at all
about the charges?

43:42.202 --> 43:46.248
[Savarese] Just before the trial began,
I proposed to my wife,

43:46.332 --> 43:47.541
and she was nervous.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.168
She kept asking me

43:49.251 --> 43:53.547
about whether I was gonna come
into any kind of harm or danger.

43:54.131 --> 43:56.717
Uh, fortunately, knock on wood,
I never did.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.135
But others around me did.

44:00.971 --> 44:04.350
[Giuliano] One day, US Marshal came
in my office and said,

44:04.433 --> 44:07.728
"We have a documented threat
from the Mob,"

44:07.811 --> 44:09.438
to kill... my wife.

44:13.651 --> 44:16.570
And they taught me and my chief assistant
how to use a gun.

44:17.154 --> 44:18.280
[typewriter clacking]

44:27.623 --> 44:29.583
[Chertoff]
Once the jury was finally seated,

44:29.667 --> 44:31.710
my job in the opening statement
was to give them

44:31.794 --> 44:35.589
a road map about what they're gonna hear
and explain it in context.

44:37.716 --> 44:38.967
"Members of the jury,

44:39.551 --> 44:43.138
Mafia families have
a single overriding purpose:

44:43.722 --> 44:47.851
to make money
using corruption, fear, and violence.

44:51.230 --> 44:53.232
The Cosa Nostra and Commission

44:53.315 --> 44:56.777
are not words that are coined or made up
by the government.

44:57.695 --> 45:00.948
These are words
these defendants used themselves.

45:01.532 --> 45:04.743
And you are going to hear them
use those words on the tapes

45:04.827 --> 45:06.870
with your very own ears."

45:09.498 --> 45:12.042
For a criminal trial in the United States,

45:12.126 --> 45:15.045
the US Constitution says the jury
has to be unanimous,

45:15.129 --> 45:18.215
so you've gotta persuade all 12 jurors.

45:20.634 --> 45:24.012
[Cardinale] If we could just convince
one or two of those jurors,

45:24.096 --> 45:25.723
we would essentially win the case.

45:28.726 --> 45:31.770
[Savarese] When the trial is underway,
you're watching the jury like a hawk.

45:31.854 --> 45:35.065
You wanna see
what their body English is like.

45:35.149 --> 45:37.151
Do they seem to be paying attention?

45:37.943 --> 45:40.946
[Chertoff] Are they understanding
the evidence? What's interesting to them?

45:41.029 --> 45:43.115
So you can calibrate your presentation.

45:45.325 --> 45:47.369
[Lang] The forewoman of the jury

45:47.453 --> 45:49.788
was a very elegant woman
who wore this gold cross.

45:51.623 --> 45:55.919
And then this young, very attractive,
red-haired woman was in the front row.

45:57.171 --> 45:59.548
And there was an elderly woman.

46:00.174 --> 46:03.594
I said to Pat, "Wait till she starts
listening to some of these tapes."

46:03.677 --> 46:06.597
Because it's difficult to understand
what was going on.

46:08.891 --> 46:11.977
The judge directs
that the jury will listen.

46:12.060 --> 46:13.353
They put on their headphones.

46:18.692 --> 46:23.906
[indistinct speech]

46:29.036 --> 46:34.333
[indistinct speech]

46:35.083 --> 46:37.044
[Lang] It seemed like the elderly woman

46:37.127 --> 46:40.798
was straining to understand
what was going on.

46:41.507 --> 46:46.762
[indistinct speech]

46:49.515 --> 46:51.433
[Savarese]
Get down to the bottom of the page.

46:52.267 --> 46:55.979
[man] <i>You look at it as a big corporation.</i>
<i>You're running a big corporation.</i>

47:00.150 --> 47:05.197
When we saw all 12 jurors<i> </i>turn the page
at exactly the right moment,

47:05.280 --> 47:06.698
we just looked at each other like,

47:06.782 --> 47:10.035
"Yes! They're following.
They're paying attention.

47:10.118 --> 47:11.745
They're hearing what we've heard."

47:14.456 --> 47:18.752
[man] <i>For several weeks, a federal jury</i>
<i>has been sifting through tape recordings.</i>

47:18.836 --> 47:24.132
The vast majority of this case
is built on, uh, tapes of the defendants

47:24.216 --> 47:26.760
<i>talking about their criminal activities.</i>
<i>It's from those tapes...</i>

47:26.844 --> 47:28.679
[Alite] Everybody followed
the Commission trial,

47:28.762 --> 47:30.639
especially if you were a street guy.

47:30.722 --> 47:34.685
When we were sitting around
the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club,

47:34.768 --> 47:39.147
we were saying it's illegal,
it's this, like we were Harvard grads.

47:39.231 --> 47:44.403
But in reality we understand
that we've got serious problems now.

47:44.486 --> 47:46.280
[man grunting]

47:53.912 --> 47:56.373
[Cardinale] The government did have
some pretty strong evidence.

47:56.456 --> 47:58.292
The head of the Lucchese family,

47:58.375 --> 48:01.795
Tony "Ducks" Corallo,
there was a bug placed in his car.

48:17.144 --> 48:20.772
[Cardinale] There were conversations
about cement trade in New York.

48:35.370 --> 48:37.831
[Cardinale] On one of the tapes,
Fat Tony remarked

48:37.915 --> 48:43.128
that he had just seen a cement truck
drive down Second Avenue with--

48:43.211 --> 48:46.131
The name on the truck
was something he didn't recognize,

48:46.214 --> 48:51.428
and he wanted to know who had guts enough
to drive a truck through Manhattan

48:51.511 --> 48:56.141
that was affiliated with a company
that he wasn't aware of or didn't control.

48:56.224 --> 48:58.226
So it was that kind of tape

48:58.310 --> 49:02.272
that was kind of difficult for us
to get around, if you will.

49:03.148 --> 49:05.317
We knew we were in for a rough ride.

49:18.580 --> 49:19.790
[typewriter clacking]

49:23.377 --> 49:27.756
The strategy that I employed
was to do everything we could to...

49:28.423 --> 49:33.428
win the so-called sex-appeal parts
of the case...

49:33.512 --> 49:37.474
uh, the violence that they threw in
gratuitously, the Galante murder.

49:40.310 --> 49:43.105
Anything that the government
can do to get an edge, they will do.

49:43.188 --> 49:46.566
If anyone thinks this is fair
and they're trying to do right is wrong.

49:46.650 --> 49:47.818
They're there to win the case.

49:49.528 --> 49:50.904
It was very dramatic,

49:50.988 --> 49:52.280
it was very violent,

49:52.364 --> 49:56.994
and it was what was put in there
only to get the jury's attention.

50:00.455 --> 50:01.707
[Chertoff] At the point in time

50:01.790 --> 50:05.502
when we started putting evidence in
about the Galante homicide,

50:05.585 --> 50:08.964
the world changed for Bruno Indelicato
inside that courtroom.

50:14.636 --> 50:19.307
The reason Bruno Indelicato,
a lower-ranking member in the Mob,

50:19.391 --> 50:23.311
was a defendant in the case
is because he was a gunman

50:23.395 --> 50:28.316
in the murder of Carmine Galante,
and the Commission authorized that murder.

50:28.400 --> 50:33.155
He was a person who took the orders
and carried out the Commission's bidding.

50:35.157 --> 50:40.704
Now, all of a sudden, he's very agitated,
squirming in his chair,

50:40.787 --> 50:44.666
understanding that no, this isn't
something he's going to skate on.

50:44.750 --> 50:45.667
All of a sudden...

50:46.752 --> 50:47.836
it's real for him.

50:49.921 --> 50:52.132
I guess it got to be too much for him.

50:52.215 --> 50:54.926
Indelicato sprang to his feet

50:55.010 --> 50:56.303
and yelled at me,

50:56.720 --> 50:58.972
"What are you doing?
You're not playing fair.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.766
I know who you are.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.059
You can't do this crap."

51:04.644 --> 51:07.856
That's the first time I ever had
a murderer actually threaten me.

51:10.192 --> 51:13.820
The marshals immediately grabbed him,
put him back into the holding cell

51:13.904 --> 51:15.405
in the back of the courtroom.

51:17.699 --> 51:18.742
Lunch happens.

51:19.284 --> 51:22.079
Indelicto comes back out,
comes over to me and says,

51:22.162 --> 51:25.415
"Mr. Childers, I want to apologize.
I was out of line."

51:26.374 --> 51:28.251
My best guess as to why

51:28.335 --> 51:30.629
there was the change
of heart in Indelicato

51:30.712 --> 51:33.840
is that he was back there
in the holding cell

51:33.924 --> 51:36.802
with "Fat Tony" Salerno,
the boss of the Genovese family,

51:36.885 --> 51:39.763
and Carmine Persico,
the boss of the Colombo family,

51:39.846 --> 51:42.891
and they're on trial for their lives also.

51:43.642 --> 51:45.477
And they outrank him.

51:46.019 --> 51:48.230
And I would think
that they would've said,

51:48.772 --> 51:52.692
"Hey, idiot, what the hell are you doing?

51:52.776 --> 51:54.444
We don't need any more problems."

51:56.738 --> 52:00.158
[Cardinale] Gil Childers was brought in
to present that case.

52:00.242 --> 52:04.454
And he did it with great fanfare
and big blow-up pictures of Galante

52:04.538 --> 52:08.166
with the cigar in his mouth and his eye
hanging out and bullet holes all over him.

52:09.042 --> 52:12.087
But all of the violence
really had nothing to do with this case.

52:13.588 --> 52:16.133
The government's theory was
there's a rule,

52:16.216 --> 52:20.053
and the rule is you can't hurt your boss
unless all the other bosses agree.

52:20.137 --> 52:21.930
The "Commission" has to agree.

52:23.348 --> 52:26.977
My argument was that Fat Tony
was not the boss of the Genovese family

52:27.060 --> 52:30.021
when Galante was murdered.
Somebody else was.

52:30.647 --> 52:32.983
So Fat Tony
really had nothing to do with it.

52:36.027 --> 52:38.822
If we could just convince
one or two of those jurors,

52:38.905 --> 52:41.950
Fat Tony had nothing to do
with the Galante murder,

52:42.033 --> 52:43.743
we could win the case.

52:50.500 --> 52:53.670
[Savarese] Everyday, you're on edge.
You're in court.

52:53.753 --> 52:56.131
Then at night,
you're preparing for the next day.

52:56.214 --> 52:58.717
And then all weekend
you're preparing for the next week.

52:58.800 --> 52:59.926
So you're exhausted.

53:00.010 --> 53:03.972
So, by the end,
we felt good that we had made our case,

53:04.055 --> 53:05.015
but you never know.

53:05.515 --> 53:08.351
And then the jury goes off,
and they deliberate.

53:08.435 --> 53:09.811
[typewriter clacking]

53:20.280 --> 53:22.282
[ticking]

53:26.578 --> 53:28.914
[Childers] You've done
everything you could do.

53:29.539 --> 53:30.707
You now realize

53:30.790 --> 53:34.294
that everything now rests
in the hands of 12 people

53:34.920 --> 53:38.256
whose names you don't even know,
'cause it was an anonymous jury.

53:42.677 --> 53:45.722
A defense attorney
only has to convince one person,

53:45.805 --> 53:48.225
and, of course, prosecutors
have to convince 12.

53:56.441 --> 54:01.071
[Savarese] The clock is kind of ticking
in your brain as each day goes by.

54:01.154 --> 54:04.491
And you're wondering to yourself,
"What are they thinking?

54:04.574 --> 54:06.618
Are they leaning our way? Are they not?

54:06.701 --> 54:07.535
Who knows?"

54:15.252 --> 54:18.755
[Giuliani] I was worried about someone
getting to the jury because...

54:18.838 --> 54:21.591
in the history of Mob cases,
they reached somebody.

54:28.807 --> 54:32.852
[Savarese] The way the Mob can undermine
the jury process is by getting to a juror.

54:32.936 --> 54:35.021
It's effectively corrupting a juror

54:35.105 --> 54:39.776
to hold out and refuse
to vote in favor of conviction.

54:46.658 --> 54:48.827
[Lang] What is going on here?

54:52.831 --> 54:55.041
[man] No verdict yet
in the Commission trial.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.961
Jury wrapped up four days of deliberating.
They go back to work tomorrow.

55:01.673 --> 55:03.383
[Cardinale] The longer a jury stays out,

55:03.466 --> 55:06.553
the better you feel that at least
there may not be a conviction.

55:06.636 --> 55:08.263
This is not a runaway.

55:13.226 --> 55:15.312
[Giuliani] I was 100% percent confident
when it started.

55:15.395 --> 55:18.273
By the fifth day,
I was less sure of the verdict.

55:20.025 --> 55:21.318
If we fail at this...

55:21.818 --> 55:24.070
ooh, it could set us back 30 years.

55:24.612 --> 55:27.282
[ticking continues]

55:36.750 --> 55:39.336
[Lang] I thought, "I can't believe
we've done all this work,

55:39.419 --> 55:41.087
and this is gonna go down the tubes."

55:44.257 --> 55:46.259
[Chertoff] My unit chief said to me,

55:46.343 --> 55:48.845
"You should write
two statements for the press:

55:48.928 --> 55:51.848
one if we convict
and one if there's an acquittal."

55:51.931 --> 55:54.184
I said, "I can't do that.
I'm gonna jinx myself."

55:54.267 --> 55:57.270
She said, "You have to do it."
So I gritted my teeth and I did it.

56:09.157 --> 56:10.575
And then we got a call.

56:14.746 --> 56:16.956
[Savarese]
The jury had reached a verdict.

56:18.583 --> 56:20.126
It was like a circus in there.

56:21.544 --> 56:24.714
Everybody showed up.
I mean, it was standing room only.

56:25.382 --> 56:27.675
[Savarese]
We could barely get into the courtroom.

56:27.759 --> 56:31.137
And I remember saying,
"Hey, we're the prosecutors.

56:31.221 --> 56:32.555
We've gotta get in there."

56:35.725 --> 56:38.561
[DeVecchio]
The culmination of years of hard work,

56:38.645 --> 56:40.647
my whole squad, came down to this.

56:43.817 --> 56:45.777
You don't want to screw this up.

56:45.860 --> 56:47.362
You don't want to be the guy

56:47.445 --> 56:50.740
who is known as the person
who let the Mob bosses off.

56:54.953 --> 56:56.663
[Lang] The jury comes back.

56:56.746 --> 56:59.374
You're looking at them all
because you're trying to read their faces,

56:59.457 --> 57:01.376
like what the hell's going on here.

57:03.545 --> 57:06.840
[Chertoff] You're sitting there,
literally with your heart in your mouth.

57:08.800 --> 57:11.469
I had my hands on my lap

57:11.553 --> 57:13.596
and I was saying, like, a prayer.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.306
And Pat reached out,

57:15.390 --> 57:17.517
and he squeezed my hand, and he goes,

57:17.600 --> 57:18.852
"Here we go, pal."

57:31.531 --> 57:32.365
Guilty.

57:34.367 --> 57:37.704
-And it was guilty, guilty, guilty.
-Guilty, guilty.

57:37.787 --> 57:40.290
Guilty, guilty, guilty, 150 times.

57:40.373 --> 57:42.041
She looked over at us.

57:42.125 --> 57:44.878
She smiled and she went...
Just like that.

57:44.961 --> 57:46.838
It's the way she nodded her head.

57:49.174 --> 57:52.552
Good evening. A major blow
for the men who rule the Mafia.

57:52.635 --> 57:56.097
Eight mobsters,
including three Mafia godfathers,

57:56.181 --> 57:58.349
were found guilty of serving
as Commission members.

57:58.433 --> 58:01.269
<i>This verdict means the death</i>
<i>of the old school Mob leadership</i>

58:01.352 --> 58:02.645
<i>in New York as we knew it.</i>

58:02.729 --> 58:06.816
<i>I think it's gonna take a long time</i>
<i>to replace the kind of network</i>

58:06.900 --> 58:07.901
<i>these men put together.</i>

58:09.736 --> 58:11.321
[Savarese] My God, we did it!

58:13.156 --> 58:16.576
[chuckles] After all this work,
all those sleepless nights,

58:16.659 --> 58:18.286
all those ruined weekends,

58:18.369 --> 58:20.705
we were finally getting
what we had fought for.

58:22.248 --> 58:25.793
These people
who were untouchables their entire lives

58:25.877 --> 58:28.087
are now gonna be brought to justice.

58:28.171 --> 58:30.673
It was, uh...
It's an incredibly moving time.

58:30.757 --> 58:33.760
<i>Every single defendant</i>
<i>was convicted on every single count,</i>

58:33.843 --> 58:36.930
<i>and I think this is a great day</i>
<i>for law enforcement</i>

58:37.013 --> 58:39.307
<i>and for all those</i>
<i>who've been in pursuit of organized crime.</i>

58:39.390 --> 58:40.558
<i>Some have lost their lives.</i>

58:41.559 --> 58:44.979
[man] <i>The top bosses of the Mafia</i>
<i>were given 100 years in prison.</i>

58:45.063 --> 58:47.607
<i>One hundred years</i>
<i>for Anthony "Fat Tony" Salerno...</i>

58:47.690 --> 58:50.151
[Alite] For us, it was devastating.

58:51.110 --> 58:56.074
When Giuliani brought this war into effect
against gangsters,

58:56.157 --> 58:57.325
it was the plague.

58:57.909 --> 59:00.537
Nothing worse than this
could ever come in existence

59:00.620 --> 59:02.539
against street guys in the Mob world.

59:02.622 --> 59:07.085
[man] <i>The FBI now counts 500 Mafia</i>
<i>convictions in the last three years,</i>

59:07.168 --> 59:09.087
<i>and it says more cases are coming.</i>

59:10.338 --> 59:13.967
[Franzese] This was the first time
in history anything like that was done.

59:14.050 --> 59:17.512
And you know it really, really
put the icing on the cake for me.

59:17.637 --> 59:19.514
I said, "When they can start doing that,

59:19.597 --> 59:22.308
this life is in real trouble,
real trouble."

59:24.352 --> 59:25.520
[Kossler] I was elated.

59:27.230 --> 59:30.733
All the hard work that we put into this
and all the time away from home

59:30.817 --> 59:34.112
and all the sweat and tears
and then it came to fruition.

59:35.154 --> 59:38.283
[DeVecchio] This was the culmination of,
as far as I was concerned,

59:38.366 --> 59:39.659
everything I had worked for.

59:39.742 --> 59:42.328
Twenty some-odd years
of working organized crime in New York.

59:42.412 --> 59:44.205
It was one of those thrills of a lifetime.

59:46.583 --> 59:49.043
[Lang] I said, "Pat, it's like
being in a Broadway show,

59:49.127 --> 59:50.253
and the show is over.

59:51.212 --> 59:53.006
So now what are we gonna do?"
[chuckles]

59:56.426 --> 59:59.220
[woman] <i>We have come to know</i>
<i>the face of Rudolph Giuliani,</i>

59:59.304 --> 1:00:02.140
<i>a steady presence in the morning papers</i>
<i>and evening news.</i>

1:00:02.223 --> 1:00:05.393
<i>More than any other US attorney</i>
<i>for the Southern District of New York,</i>

1:00:05.476 --> 1:00:08.479
<i>Giuliani has sewn himself</i>
<i>into the fabric of this city.</i>

1:00:08.563 --> 1:00:11.774
<i>His most recent Mafia busts</i>
<i>resulting in death threats...</i>

1:00:13.693 --> 1:00:16.154
[Giuliani] As an Italian-American,
I'm absolutely proud

1:00:16.237 --> 1:00:19.073
to be the man who helped to destroy it
and who led the effort.

1:00:19.157 --> 1:00:21.909
<i>Rudolph Giuliani has officially</i>
<i>jumped into the race for mayor</i>

1:00:21.993 --> 1:00:25.496
<i>at the place where two other Republicans</i>
<i>started their successful campaigns.</i>

1:01:02.617 --> 1:01:05.119
<i>As we wrap up this series,</i>
<i>it's interesting to note</i>

1:01:05.203 --> 1:01:06.579
<i>that for law enforcement officials,</i>

1:01:06.663 --> 1:01:10.041
<i>the questions tonight are</i>
<i>who will the next generation of bosses be,</i>

1:01:10.124 --> 1:01:12.835
<i>and what kind of shadowy crime game</i>
<i>will they play?</i>

1:01:12.919 --> 1:01:15.088
[sirens wailing]

1:01:20.885 --> 1:01:22.887
[intense music playing]
