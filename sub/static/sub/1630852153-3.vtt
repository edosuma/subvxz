08:53.567 --> 08:55.667
We're not building the place,
we're gonna wreck it.

08:55.800 --> 08:56.934
I know we're
wrecking it, Ted,

08:57.066 --> 08:59.300
but I don't want to wreck it
while we're standing under it.

08:59.433 --> 09:01.266
I don't care if the
roof falls on my head,

09:01.400 --> 09:04.834
but if it falls on Julien,
I am in big trouble.

09:04.967 --> 09:06.333
Look at all the
twig furniture;

09:06.467 --> 09:08.467
that's classic lodge stuff.

09:08.600 --> 09:12.533
That's got age. It's old.
Look at the air burn.

09:12.667 --> 09:15.166
Air burn is a term
used to describe the

09:15.300 --> 09:17.000
oxidization of the wood.

09:17.133 --> 09:19.033
Little bit of staining,
little bit of beautiful...

09:19.166 --> 09:23.033
Over time, exposed
lumber naturally darkens,

09:23.166 --> 09:25.133
just being
exposed to oxygen.

09:25.266 --> 09:26.300
I like that.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.700
And I like
these chairs too.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.667
Well, grab 'em, man.
We'll get like 30--

09:29.800 --> 09:31.233
we'll fill up the trailer.
See?

09:31.367 --> 09:33.100
At least one, for sure,
with all this stuff.

09:33.233 --> 09:34.667
- Look at the hutch.
- That's nice.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.967
Ted likes this!
That's a beauty!

09:37.100 --> 09:38.400
How much do you
think these go for?

09:38.533 --> 09:42.734
20 years ago, 1500 bucks.
Now, 4 or 500.

09:42.867 --> 09:45.200
Really? It depreciates, or just
people not being interested?

09:45.333 --> 09:47.400
You know what it is,
younger people aren't into it.

09:47.533 --> 09:48.500
Yeah.

09:48.633 --> 09:49.967
I'm gonna boot around,
take a quick look,

09:50.100 --> 09:52.000
see what else I can find.
- Okay!

09:52.133 --> 09:54.066
Ted and Julien have
made a dent in their

09:54.200 --> 09:55.934
goal of $5000 in salvage....

09:56.066 --> 09:58.000
We're taking that.
That's sweet.

people run out of time, money.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.633
It hasn't been well

It's past its due date.

how to support the ceiling

12:51.900 --> 12:52.934
You think 2, Vic, or 1?

12:53.066 --> 12:54.600
Well, I think
these are pretty heavy,

12:54.734 --> 12:55.867
so I think one, each side.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.533
Vic leans on his long history
in demolition

12:58.667 --> 13:00.500

reusing the timbers to
jack up the ceiling.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.633
(saw grinds)

roof from falling on our heads

these poles out.

feel of a farmhouse and so,

27:18.500 --> 27:20.500
I didn't want to go to
your box store and order,

27:20.633 --> 27:22.633
you know,
perfectly cut doors.

27:22.767 --> 27:25.734
- What do you think of those?
- Oh, wow, those are perfect.

27:25.867 --> 27:28.100
These ones all came from a
lighthouse on Georgian Bay.

27:28.233 --> 27:29.233
Oh, wow.

27:29.367 --> 27:30.800
I know that for a fact
'cause I took them down.

27:30.934 --> 27:31.934
Oh, nice.

27:32.066 --> 27:34.300
Like, it was this old light
house that had been

27:34.433 --> 27:36.500
out there since
1870 or something,

27:36.633 --> 27:38.967
and we had to have
these doors just because,

27:39.100 --> 27:40.567
look at them,
they're gorgeous.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.800
- The lighthouse is haunted...
- (laughs) Okay.

27:43.934 --> 27:45.867
And it was full
of rattlesnakes.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.734
So, am I gonna get
ghosts with these, or what?

27:48.867 --> 27:51.567
(laughs) I don't think they
ghosts go with the door.

27:51.700 --> 27:52.633
I think they stay
with the house.

27:52.767 --> 27:54.000
That's a good thing, thanks.

27:54.133 --> 27:55.633
I think it's
terrible sales tactic,

27:55.767 --> 27:57.934
but I think everyone
is intrigued by ghosts.

27:58.066 --> 28:00.734
People love the story
behind these items and,

28:00.867 --> 28:02.133
as long as you can
relay that story,

28:02.266 --> 28:03.800
they can feel a part of it.

28:03.934 --> 28:05.667
But, it was an
amazing place.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.300
That actually fits perfect
with the timeframe of

28:08.433 --> 28:09.667
when the house was built so...

28:09.800 --> 28:11.033
- Good.
- These are gonna be perfect.

28:11.166 --> 28:12.066
So, they just
went up in price?

28:12.200 --> 28:14.033
- They're perfect time.
- (laughs) Oh, sure.

28:14.166 --> 28:16.133
There is no way I'm gonna
let these doors go cheap

28:16.266 --> 28:17.900
after all the work
we put into them.

28:18.033 --> 28:19.500
So, because
they are perfect,

28:19.633 --> 28:20.700
and because
they are vintage,

28:20.834 --> 28:22.233
and because
they are haunted,

28:22.367 --> 28:23.800
there's a great
price on these.

28:23.934 --> 28:26.834
- What are they going for?
- 150 bucks each for these.

28:26.967 --> 28:28.400
That's not gonna work.

28:28.533 --> 28:31.133
I was expecting more
around 80 range.

28:31.266 --> 28:32.533
- 80?
- Yeah.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.834
These came from a lighthouse
that does not exist anymore.

28:34.967 --> 28:37.300
These are your era.

28:37.433 --> 28:40.133
They had to go on a boat,
then a truck, come here.

28:40.266 --> 28:41.667
There's a lot of
money into these.

28:41.800 --> 28:45.734
- We can't sell 'em for 80.
- Um...

28:45.867 --> 28:47.967
You're gonna have to
come down from 150 though.

28:48.100 --> 28:51.233
- That's just way too much.
- Okay... You want 8.

28:51.367 --> 28:52.967
So, because
you're buying in bulk,

28:53.100 --> 28:55.200
why don't we kind of
split the difference?

28:55.333 --> 29:00.433
So, I will do, I'll do
100 bucks each for 8 doors,

29:00.567 --> 29:03.767
and I will help
you load them.

29:03.900 --> 29:05.233
- Okay, perfect.
- Yeah?

29:05.367 --> 29:06.900
- That'll work. That'll work.
- Okay, deal.

Yeah, it's what it is.

I guess you didn't

Yeah, I'm a

Well, that's cool.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.433

different themes?

36:34.567 --> 36:35.967
- Pro dom for 20 years.
- Seriously?

36:36.100 --> 36:36.967
Mhm.

36:37.100 --> 36:38.166
Okay, well, let's look at
the Niagara thing.

professional dominatrix

36:51.867 --> 36:53.333

36:53.467 --> 36:55.033
You see, it's a travel case.
You bring it anywhere.

36:55.166 --> 36:57.967
- (laughs)
- It's just very discreet.

36:58.100 --> 36:59.367

36:59.500 --> 37:03.100
current airline restrictions.

- Oh, wow.

Look at this thing.

37:08.633 --> 37:10.734
- You went right for that part.
- Yeah, I did.

37:10.867 --> 37:12.200
Well, that's the
important part.

37:12.333 --> 37:14.200
So, you don't even know
if this works, then, eh?

37:14.333 --> 37:16.567
No, I've never tried it.
The wires are a bit crispy;

37:16.700 --> 37:18.266
that's what happens
with old stuff.

37:18.400 --> 37:21.166
I think you probably
gotta just rewire that part.

37:21.300 --> 37:23.033
Put a new cord on there.

37:23.166 --> 37:24.967
It has the option
of massage and heat.

37:25.100 --> 37:27.166
- Looks cool.
- It does look cool.

37:27.300 --> 37:29.133
I just feel like I want to hit
somebody with it though.

37:29.266 --> 37:32.000
- Well, don't hit me. (laughs)
- It's more of an impact toy.

37:32.133 --> 37:33.333
I'll give you a
good deal on it.

37:33.467 --> 37:35.166
That's not the purpose,
is it? Uh-oh.

37:35.300 --> 37:37.900
Oh, but you can turn everything
into a pervertable.

37:38.033 --> 37:38.900
A pervertable?

37:39.033 --> 37:40.033
Yeah, you ever
heard that word?

37:40.166 --> 37:42.967
No. That's a different lingo.
I'm a salvage guy.

37:43.100 --> 37:45.333
Oh, hi, salvage guy.
Well, I'm a dominatrix.

37:45.467 --> 37:46.767
So, let me tell you
what a pervertable is.

37:46.900 --> 37:49.266
So, pervertable is when you
take like some random thing

37:49.400 --> 37:51.200
and you turn it into
something you can use for,

37:51.333 --> 37:53.533
like, an erotic scenario.

37:53.667 --> 37:55.066
I use that to
light a fire.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.200
(laughs) Well, I'd use this
to light a fire, too,

37:57.333 --> 37:58.667
just a different kind of fire.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.967
Oh, my god. (laughs)

38:01.100 --> 38:03.533
When people are coming
into my dungeon and

38:03.667 --> 38:06.000
into the medical room,
they're looking for,

38:06.133 --> 38:08.800
for an authentic sort of
medical role play experience,

38:08.934 --> 38:11.000
so this would definitely take it
a few decades back.

38:11.133 --> 38:12.433
Yeah, it's authentic alright.

38:12.567 --> 38:14.600
They used to
treat hysteria with it.

38:14.734 --> 38:17.533
Female hysteria.

38:17.667 --> 38:20.700
In the early 20th century,
some in the medical community

38:20.834 --> 38:23.100
attempted to explain
symptoms of anxiety,

38:23.233 --> 38:26.200
irritability, and the
loss of sex drive in women.

38:26.333 --> 38:29.033
The diagnosis was
called female hysteria.

38:29.166 --> 38:31.700
One of the treatment methods
prescribed was the use of

38:31.834 --> 38:33.934
mechanically
vibrating massagers.

38:34.066 --> 38:36.900
It wasn't until the
1950s that the diagnosis of

38:37.033 --> 38:39.867
hysteria as a mental
disorder fell out of use.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.200
I will plug that in.
I bet ya it still works.

38:42.333 --> 38:44.500
Vintage stuff
always keeps working.

38:44.633 --> 38:46.233
If somebody's gonna stick that
where the sun doesn't shine,

38:46.367 --> 38:48.133
it'd be good if they
didn't get electrocuted.

38:48.266 --> 38:49.967
- Yeah, that's always good.
- Yeah.

38:50.100 --> 38:52.367
Be a shocking experience.
Ready?

38:52.500 --> 38:53.633
- (buzz)
- Ah! (laughs)

38:53.767 --> 38:57.433
- Oh, look at that.
- Still works.

38:57.567 --> 38:58.834
That still works.

38:58.967 --> 39:01.867
So, what do you
want for this?

39:02.000 --> 39:04.934
I'm not sure, to be honest.
I-- rarely does this happen,

39:05.066 --> 39:07.133
but I haven't come across
one of these before and

39:07.266 --> 39:08.767
I haven't done any research.

39:08.900 --> 39:11.133
- What did you pay for it?
- Well, my labour and stuff.

39:11.266 --> 39:12.367
I must have 100
bucks into this.

39:12.500 --> 39:13.867
Are you gonna
rewire it for me?

39:14.000 --> 39:16.700
(laughs) Are you gonna
spank me if I don't?

39:16.834 --> 39:18.867
I might. (laughs)
Only if you say yes.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.467

the stuff like this.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.867

electrocuted with it, so...

39:28.433 --> 39:29.567
No, that's not
good for business.

39:29.700 --> 39:30.867
No.

You're gonna help me
deliver this.

43:37.734 --> 43:38.900
We gotta go down
and deliver it.

43:39.033 --> 43:39.900
I'm a little freaked out.

43:40.033 --> 43:41.333
I thought you'd like it;
it's like a tool.

43:41.467 --> 43:43.967
Well, you're coming at me
with a vibrating thing that's--

43:44.100 --> 43:45.500
I'm not coming at you
with the vibrator.

43:45.633 --> 43:48.767
- Now I am.
- See, like, you're just...

43:48.900 --> 43:51.734
- It's a massager.

43:51.867 --> 43:52.867
I'll finish this.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.567
I'll come and get you
when we're ready.

43:54.700 --> 43:55.800
I don't have any words.

43:55.934 --> 43:58.333
Why are you so
freaked out about it?

43:58.467 --> 43:59.867

44:00.066 --> 44:03.333
Man... does feel good.
