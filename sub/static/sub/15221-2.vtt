in a double-header in Detroit,
and he hit a batter.

10:53.753 --> 10:58.747

13:23.602 --> 13:26.935
Those road trips can be brutal.

13:27.006 --> 13:29.702
Well, how about a drink?

13:29.775 --> 13:33.575
Oh, no. No, thanks.
No, I meant for me.

13:35.381 --> 13:37.645
Yeah, sure. Sure.

13:40.452 --> 13:44.582
Heard the game on the radio.
You did?

13:44.657 --> 13:48.024
It's a good thing you're better
in bed than runnin' bases.
[ Laughs ]

13:48.093 --> 13:52.291
Well, it's gettin' a little hard to remember.
You know, I haven't seen you lately.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.764
You didn't show up the last time.
What happened?

13:54.834 --> 13:58.736
Well, I, uh- Here's your drink.
I, uh- I got a little busy, you know.

13:58.804 --> 14:02.069
Sometimes-
I thought we had
an understandin', Doc.

14:02.141 --> 14:05.872
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm. I help you.
You help me.

14:07.613 --> 14:11.174
I- I really think
that I should get these elbows
kind of looked at. Don't you?

14:11.250 --> 14:14.378
I'm not gonna have trouble
with you, am I?
Mm, I don't think so.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.580
Let me just explain
something to you.

14:16.655 --> 14:20.716
See, Harlan Edwards may wear
the manager's uniform on this team,

14:20.793 --> 14:23.227
but I run this team.

14:23.295 --> 14:27.459
And in order to be successful on this team,
you have to be a team player.

14:27.533 --> 14:31.025
You are a team player,
aren't you, Doc?

14:31.103 --> 14:32.934
I try.

14:38.143 --> 14:41.738
[ Sighs ]
<i>[ Chucky ]</i>
<i>Hey, what'd the dragon lady want?</i>

14:41.814 --> 14:46.717
Oh, she just, uh, wanted to talk to me
about my... performance.

14:46.785 --> 14:50.221
[ Laughs ]
I thought she was onto us.

14:50.289 --> 14:52.917
- Us?
- Hi, Doc.

14:52.992 --> 14:55.859
I thought that she was
drillin' you about us.

14:55.928 --> 14:59.591
- Mother doesn't like baseball players.
- Is that right?

14:59.665 --> 15:02.429
Well, last thing I need, though,
is for her to get mad at me.

15:02.501 --> 15:05.766
She's the one who makes the decisions
on who plays and who doesn't.

15:05.838 --> 15:10.036
Oh, would you stop worryin'.
You are gonna start in that game.

15:10.109 --> 15:15.103
And when that scout sees you,
you'll be bigger than Sandy Koufax.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.171
<i>Mmm.!</i>

15:17.249 --> 15:20.650
[ Giggles ]
Hey, we're going to get some burgers.
You wanna come?

15:20.719 --> 15:23.017
No, thanks.
I'm gonna call it a night here.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.386
Hey, Doc, maybe
you oughta go get a room.

15:25.457 --> 15:28.949
Huh?
This ain't no way
for a big-leaguer to live.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.267
<i>[ Sam Narrating ]</i>
<i>After a night on Doc's cot,</i>

15:36.335 --> 15:39.862
<i>I wondered how he was able to walk,</i>
<i>much less play baseball.</i>

15:39.939 --> 15:44.535
<i>I was also wondering how I was</i>
<i>going to fool anyone into believing</i>
<i>I was a major league pitcher.</i>

15:44.610 --> 15:48.546
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>Yeah, there is something magical</i>
<i>about a baseball diamond.</i>

15:51.250 --> 15:56.347
Yeah, no matter how old you get,
it still makes you feel like a kid.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.617
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>Spread it out.</i>

15:58.691 --> 16:01.251
What are you wearing?
What is this?

16:01.327 --> 16:04.626
Oh, I dug up my old uniform.
What do you think? Nice, huh?

16:04.697 --> 16:07.359
You played for Navy?
Starting pitcher.

16:07.433 --> 16:10.163
Get outta here.
I had the lowest
earned run average in the league.

16:10.235 --> 16:13.204
Is there anything
you haven't done?
No.

16:13.272 --> 16:18.471
No, wait. There's these twins
at the fitness center.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.774
All right.
I'm sorry I asked.
Ooh-

16:20.846 --> 16:25.249
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I asked.
Did you find out how
to get me out of here yet?

16:25.317 --> 16:30.414
Well, apparently Doc took
a one-run lead in the ninth inning
in the play-off game,

16:30.489 --> 16:33.890
but then he hurt his arm
and gave up a two-run homer.

16:33.959 --> 16:37.451
But we still don't know
why this game is so important.

16:38.797 --> 16:41.732
The scout.
Huh?

16:41.800 --> 16:45.861
The scout.
The sc- Oh, the scout.
The scout. What about the scout?

16:45.938 --> 16:49.203
There's supposed to be a scout
at the game tomorrow-
a major league scout.

16:49.274 --> 16:53.074
Chucky's all hyped up
about this being his big chance
to get into the majors.

16:53.145 --> 16:56.911
Yeah, but no- On the original game,
Doc got the start, not Chucky.

16:56.982 --> 17:02.579
Yeah, well, uh,
I'm not sure that Doc got the start
because of his pitching abilities.

17:02.654 --> 17:05.452
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>Get down.!</i>
Meaning?

17:05.523 --> 17:09.824
I think he slept his way in.
Hey, Bull,
get your butt out here!

17:11.663 --> 17:13.893
How's the arm, Doc?
It's good.

17:13.965 --> 17:15.934
Good boy.

17:16.001 --> 17:17.935
All right, boys,
back to work!

17:18.002 --> 17:19.936
This could be messier than I thought.

17:20.005 --> 17:23.566
What? Oh, no, no.
Not with him.

17:23.642 --> 17:26.109
Oh, no?
With the owner.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.874
The owner?
The female owner.

17:28.947 --> 17:30.881
Oh, the female owner.
Yes.

17:30.949 --> 17:32.883
Oh, okay.
Well, then, that's perfect.

17:32.951 --> 17:35.146
Yeah, you sleep with her.
Uh, you get into the game-

17:35.220 --> 17:37.586
No. No.
You change the outcome,
and then you leap out.

17:37.656 --> 17:40.250
I don't want to sleep with her.
She gives me the creeps.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.418
Well, I don't think
you have much choice.

17:42.494 --> 17:47.955
Look, if she gives you the creeps,
just... take a couple of aspirin first.

17:48.033 --> 17:52.970
Well, if you don't get in the game,
you can't leap out of here.
You sure?

17:53.038 --> 17:56.371
Yeah, it's right here
in yellow and pink.
All right.

17:56.442 --> 17:59.002
Green and blue
and orange and purple-
All right. All right.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.104
Let's just say that I... do it.

18:02.181 --> 18:06.311
We still got a big problem.
I don't know how to pitch.

18:06.385 --> 18:09.445
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>You can't hold it like that.</i>
<i>It's hand pitching.</i>

18:09.521 --> 18:11.887
What's wrong
with holding it like this?
Because-

18:11.957 --> 18:15.017
It's fine if that was a hand grenade,
but it's a baseball.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.654
You gotta treat it
like a woman.

18:17.729 --> 18:21.529
Why does everything always
come down to being a woman?
Just go with me on this, will ya?

18:21.600 --> 18:24.626
You gotta treat the baseball
like you love it.

18:24.703 --> 18:27.171
Caress it...
just with two fingers.

18:27.239 --> 18:29.264
Over the top, like that.

18:29.341 --> 18:31.866
Right leg's your power leg.
You come over the top,

18:31.944 --> 18:33.878
bring your hand down
into your glove.

18:33.946 --> 18:37.882
Just two fingers. Want-
Make it simple. Aim for the target.
<i>[ Man ] He's out.</i>

18:37.950 --> 18:41.113
The worst analogy I've ever heard.
This is not gonna work!

18:41.186 --> 18:43.552
You wanna stay here forever?

18:43.622 --> 18:45.681
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>That's out.</i>

18:45.757 --> 18:47.691
Like a woman.

18:47.759 --> 18:49.954
<i>Over the top.</i>

18:51.063 --> 18:54.464
It worked.
Of course it worked.
You ever doubt me?

18:54.533 --> 18:56.467
Well, no, I didn't doubt you.
It's just-

18:56.535 --> 18:58.469
You doubted me.
I didn't doubt you.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.506
- <i>You did too.</i>
- [ Groaning ]

19:01.573 --> 19:05.566
- Wow.
- You're lucky I didn't throw you my fastball.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.204
I know what you're thinking.
<i>[ Coach ]</i>
<i>Okay, everybody in the showers.</i>

19:08.280 --> 19:10.544
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Yes, I do know what you're thinking.

19:10.616 --> 19:14.382
You're thinking,
"How can I do that to this kid?
He's got all the talent.''

19:14.453 --> 19:18.685
Well, trust me.
It isn't gonna matter.
What are you talking about?

19:18.757 --> 19:21.692
<i>That is what I'm talking about.</i>

19:21.760 --> 19:25.025
He gets caught doin'
the bingo-bango-bongo
with Lolita there,

19:25.097 --> 19:29.193
gets kicked off the team
and never makes it back
into organized ball.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.902
It's gonna kill his father.

19:32.971 --> 19:37.271
Well, that's gonna be hard to do.
The father deserted the family
when he was five years old.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.277
No, no, that can't be right.
He told me his father played baseball.

19:40.345 --> 19:44.509
Well, when you make somebody up,
you can make 'em up to be
whatever you want 'em to be.

20:09.174 --> 20:13.804
I suppose so. Looks to me like
you lost interest in the game for a while.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.746
Yeah, well, I had
some things to work out.
Mm.

20:16.815 --> 20:20.876
Well, it must be very difficult
carryin' around that kind of guilt.

20:20.953 --> 20:25.390
I don't know why in the world you'd
wanna put yourself in for it again.

20:25.457 --> 20:29.723
Well, I just-
I'm looking at this as a way
to bring everything full circle...

20:29.795 --> 20:32.764
and then... move on.

20:32.831 --> 20:36.062

He died of a heart attack.

Oh. I'm-I'm sorry to hear that.
He looks like a very fine man.

20:58.490 --> 21:02.324

scout at that game tomorrow.

<i>It occurs to me that a person</i>-
<i>say, a pitcher maybe</i>-

<i>So?</i>
Yeah, I thought I saw you.

Now, I know this can't
be easy for you,

23:46.858 --> 23:51.420
but don't you think that Chucky
deserves to know the truth?

23:51.496 --> 23:54.954
- You think you know what that is?
- You tellin' me you're not his father?

23:57.702 --> 24:00.967
<i>Look, Mr. Monroe, I know</i>
<i>it's none of my business</i>-

You're right about that.

<i>Believe me, I wouldn't be out here</i>
<i>unless I felt it was necessary.</i>

24:08.113 --> 24:12.277
But there's a confused kid
out there-your son-

24:12.350 --> 24:16.343
and he is so full of anger
and-and-and guilt...

24:16.421 --> 24:18.616

you're part of the reason.

What's your father do
for a living, Mr. Fuller?

Then the Depression came,
factories closed.

He lost his job,
and we lost our home.

I came in one day,
found him lying on the floor.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.747
I can't be here to make
the same mistake twice, Al.
What the hell's the matter?

38:38.816 --> 38:41.341
<i>[ Sam ]</i>
<i>My arm's dead. I'm taking</i>
<i>myself out of the game.</i>

38:41.419 --> 38:45.082
Well, you're risking
an awful lot, Sam.
Yeah, I know.

38:45.156 --> 38:48.057
It's all yours, kid.

38:48.125 --> 38:50.719
<i>[ Announcer ]</i>
<i>Well, now, here's a surprise.</i>

38:50.795 --> 38:53.355
<i>Looks like Doc Fuller</i>
<i>is pullin'himself off the mound,</i>

38:53.431 --> 38:55.592
<i>and he's turnin'this game</i>
<i>over to Myerwich.</i>

38:55.666 --> 38:58.157
Go get 'em.
<i>[ Umpire ]</i>
<i>Play ball.!</i>

38:58.235 --> 39:00.897
- <i>[ Crowd Cheering ]</i>
- Chucky's gonna pitch.

39:03.407 --> 39:07.036
<i>[ Bunny ]</i>
<i>Yeah.! Come on, Chucky.!</i>

39:12.316 --> 39:14.750
Strike!

39:17.088 --> 39:19.750
- Strike!
- Way to pitch!

39:19.824 --> 39:23.055
<i>[ Announcer, Indistinct ]</i>

39:25.529 --> 39:27.463
You're out!

39:28.799 --> 39:31.233
Strike!

39:39.110 --> 39:42.876
<i>[ Announcer ]</i>
<i>Wow.! That's gone to the left field</i>-
<i>that ball there.!</i>

39:47.651 --> 39:50.814
<i>Well, fans, looks like</i>
<i>it's comin'down to this</i>-

39:50.888 --> 39:52.981
<i>two outs, bottom of the ninth inning,</i>
<i>one man on,</i>

39:53.057 --> 39:56.288
<i>and the Eagles'big ol'power hitter</i>
<i>steppin'up to the plate.</i>

39:56.360 --> 40:00.387
<i>[ Crowd Shouting ]</i>

40:00.464 --> 40:02.625
- Strike!
- <i>[ Announcer ] Strike one.!</i>

40:10.474 --> 40:13.568
<i>[ Announcer, Indistinct ]</i>

40:15.546 --> 40:18.413
<i>Strike two.!</i>
Yes! All right.
One more, baby! One more!

40:18.482 --> 40:21.349
Come on! One more!

40:35.733 --> 40:37.792
<i>[ Announcer ]</i>
<i>That ball is well tagged.</i>

40:37.868 --> 40:41.998
<i>That's a deep fly ball</i>
<i>headed out to left field.!</i>
<i>That one could get outta here.</i>

40:42.072 --> 40:44.131
<i>Doc Fuller is goin'back, goin'back.</i>

40:44.208 --> 40:48.304
<i>That ball just might be high off the wall,</i>
<i>or it's outta here for sure.</i>

40:48.379 --> 40:51.940
<i>Fuller's goin'back, goin'back field,</i>
<i>lookin'up now.</i>

40:52.016 --> 40:56.350
<i>He may have a beam on it.</i>
<i>He's</i>- <i>He's climbin'the fence.!</i>

40:56.420 --> 41:01.483
<i>He got it.! What a catch.!</i>
<i>What a game.!</i>

41:01.559 --> 41:04.528
- Great catch!
- Yes! Yes!

41:04.595 --> 41:07.792
- Way to go, Doc!
- [ Crowd Cheering ]

41:07.865 --> 41:10.197
<i>[ Announcer ]</i>
<i>Oh, boy, what a game.!</i>

41:17.908 --> 41:21.400
Hey, great game, Doc.
Yeah, you too.
See you later, guys.

41:22.746 --> 41:24.680
How you doin'?

41:25.983 --> 41:28.577
[ Snickering ]

41:30.087 --> 41:32.612
[ Sighs ]
That was a heck of a catch.

41:32.690 --> 41:34.783
Thanks.

41:34.859 --> 41:40.229
Of course, you wouldn't have
had to make it if you didn't have to
let that batter off the hook like that.

41:40.297 --> 41:42.959
You set him up with the heat,
and you brought it back again.

41:43.033 --> 41:46.901
- That was a rookie mistake.
- And who are you?

41:46.971 --> 41:51.067
You got a dangerous weapon there, kid,
and a brain could make it lethal.

41:51.141 --> 41:54.907
How'd you like to have one,
courtesy of the New York Yankees?

41:56.514 --> 42:00.075
Are you giving me
a shot at the show?
Not on one outing.

42:00.150 --> 42:03.711
But I think I can stick around
for the big game.

42:03.787 --> 42:07.382
Sam, get this.
Chucky pitches a one-hitter
in the championship game...

42:07.458 --> 42:09.722
and then gets upped to the majors
in six months.

42:09.793 --> 42:13.752
Wait a second. What about Doc?
I mean, it was his game.

42:15.332 --> 42:18.358
Ah, there's not much call
for a 3 5-year-old rookie
with a bum arm.

42:20.037 --> 42:24.064
<i>But it took brains</i>
<i>to yank yourself out of that game.</i>

42:24.141 --> 42:27.372
I could use a pitching coach
with those kind of smarts.

42:30.347 --> 42:32.872
Are you offering me a job
in the majors?

42:32.950 --> 42:34.941
Unless you've got other plans.

42:35.019 --> 42:37.613
Sam, this is great. Ziggy was hung up
on semantics or something,

42:37.688 --> 42:40.122
but this is the break that
Doc needed- pitching coach.

42:40.190 --> 42:43.250
No, no. I-I don't have
any other plans.

42:43.327 --> 42:46.990
Good. I'll come by tomorrow.
We'll talk.
Great.

42:47.064 --> 42:49.589
Keep icing that shoulder.
You bet.

42:49.667 --> 42:52.329
Heck of a catch!
[ Chuckles ]

42:56.040 --> 42:58.440
You did it, Sam.
Might as well leap.

43:02.379 --> 43:04.677
I don't think so.

43:06.317 --> 43:10.481
Hey, kid, come here.
I want you to meet somebody.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.993
This is Warren Monroe.

43:18.062 --> 43:20.553
Uh, Mr. Monroe.

43:24.368 --> 43:26.302
Have we met before?

43:27.671 --> 43:29.696
Long time ago.

43:29.773 --> 43:33.709
He's a big fan of yours.
No kiddin'?

43:33.777 --> 43:38.407
I've seen you play a few times.
You're good.

43:39.750 --> 43:43.345
Well, I don't know about that.

43:43.420 --> 43:47.584
I'd have been in a lot of trouble if-
if Doc here hadn't made that leap.

43:47.658 --> 43:49.626
You can say that again, kid.

43:56.433 --> 44:01.063
I was wonderin', uh-

44:04.942 --> 44:07.536
Could I buy you a cup of coffee?

44:10.514 --> 44:12.914
I'd like that.

44:14.885 --> 44:16.819
Great.

44:20.290 --> 44:23.418
Hey, Doc, you wanna come?
No, I'll catch up to you.

44:27.498 --> 44:30.262
Oh, now, see? This is great.
You did it, Sam.
[ Laughing ]

44:30.334 --> 44:32.598
You united the kid with his father.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.696
Yeah.
And, uh-And Doc goes
back to the major leagues.

44:35.773 --> 44:40.039
Everything's great.
You know, Al, I think I should have
played baseball instead of basketball.

44:40.110 --> 44:42.772
Oh, yeah?
I think I could have been
a pretty good baseball player.

44:42.846 --> 44:47.715
<i>Hey, Doc, that was</i>
<i>a heck of a catch.</i>

44:49.520 --> 44:51.579
Yeah, it- it wasn't too bad.

44:59.830 --> 45:02.765
[ Cat Mews ]
<i>[ Woman ]</i>
<i>That's the last of it.</i>

45:02.833 --> 45:05.461
Comin' through.

45:05.536 --> 45:09.267
Thanks. Thanks a million.
I don't wanna hang you up anymore.

45:09.339 --> 45:12.900
<i>I just didn't know</i>
<i>how I was gonna do it alone.</i>
<i>It's hideous, isn't it?</i>

45:12.976 --> 45:15.740
I know it's silly, but I'd just die
if anything happened to it.

45:15.813 --> 45:17.906
It's all I got left from my dad.

45:17.981 --> 45:20.814
Then you sure don't wanna
leave it behind for a hurricane.

45:20.884 --> 45:23.717
Hurricane?
[ Cat Screeches ]

45:23.787 --> 45:26.221
Oh, boy.
