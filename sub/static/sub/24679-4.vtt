Where's your witness?

00:36.837 --> 00:38.646
He's a no-show.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.465
- Too bad he didn't show up.
- Hmm.

01:00.994 --> 01:03.372
He was probably scared off.
I should've gone by myself.

01:03.430 --> 01:06.707
I could've put three more
burglary raps on Walters.

01:35.862 --> 01:38.035
it's Linda. They said she passed out.

- Where?
- Some tenement uptown,

01:39.900 --> 01:42.847
she was meeting a pro bono
client, they can't wake her.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.348
They found my number in her wallet.

01:44.404 --> 01:47.078
They called you before they called 911?

01:47.841 --> 01:49.514
It doesn't sound right.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.920
You should try calling her
on your cell phone.

02:02.489 --> 02:05.368
I'll explain later. I'll see you at home.

02:07.327 --> 02:09.830
She was having lunch at Chanterelle.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.205
That is really weird.

02:12.265 --> 02:13.642
Maybe not.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.373
What are you talking about?

02:15.435 --> 02:18.177
The phantom witness. Now this phone call.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.683
No. No.

02:20.741 --> 02:24.917
It's just probably some stupid prank.

02:26.346 --> 02:29.156
Who do you think is doing this?
Someone you prosecuted?

02:29.216 --> 02:31.253
Maybe it was one of your old clients,

02:31.318 --> 02:34.197
maybe they feel you didn't argue
their case with enough zeal?

02:34.955 --> 02:38.960
Mommy? Mommy, I made you a drawing.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.233
Oh, sweetie, that is beautiful!

02:41.294 --> 02:43.774
It's your office, Mommy. And that's me.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.311
Can you draw a picture
with you in Daddy's office?

02:47.734 --> 02:50.146
No. Your office is yucky.

02:51.438 --> 02:53.440
Well, Sara, if you draw me a nice picture,

02:53.507 --> 02:56.454
I'll put it in my office
and then it won't be so yucky.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.683
Okay. Mommy, come help me.

02:58.745 --> 02:59.883
Okay.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.185
Yeah, yeah. The brakes, I couldn't stop.

03:29.242 --> 03:30.346
- You said the brakes?
- Yeah.

03:30.410 --> 03:33.084
I kept pressing down but nothing
happened. What are you doing?

03:33.146 --> 03:34.750
I know something about cars.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.387
No wonder your brakes didn't work.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.523
Somebody punched a hole in your brake line.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.451
EAMES: The lines had been perforated

04:34.508 --> 04:36.510
so the brakes would go out on your way home.

04:36.576 --> 04:39.216
I take the FDR home. I could've been killed.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.054
Do you drive your car to work every day?

04:41.114 --> 04:43.720
Oh, just Wednesdays. I pick up
my daughter at her swimming lessons.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.457
I take her out for Chinese food.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.931
Did you trace the address
of that tenement uptown?

04:47.988 --> 04:49.797
It was an abandoned building.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.963
I can't believe...

04:52.292 --> 04:55.102
Ron, if you hadn't told me to call
Linda on her cell phone, I...

04:55.162 --> 04:58.769
The no-show witness, who did
he have information on?

04:58.832 --> 05:00.573
Eric Walters.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.774
Walters is looking at two-to-four
on a simple burglary.

05:03.837 --> 05:07.250
Until we know what's what, I'd like to
post a patrol car in front of your home.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.720
No. I don't want to alarm my family.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.656
Anyway, Linda's out of town
this week in San Francisco.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.489
I'll send Sara to stay with her grandmother.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.858
That still leaves you.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.360
I have a carry permit for it.

His list of cases, larcenies,
fraud, possession.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.315
All low-profile nonviolent crimes.

05:39.806 --> 05:42.116
I take it he's not one of your starters.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.882
Peter may not be the most brilliant
prosecutor in our office,

05:45.946 --> 05:48.950
but right now he's the one in the most danger.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.153
Let me know what you find out.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.494
WALTERS: I got no beef with Mr. Bonham.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.334
He's got his job and I got mine.

06:01.394 --> 06:04.000
EAMES: What's that, burglary,
accessory to murder?

06:04.064 --> 06:05.634
I don't get with no murder.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.975
Someone used your name to lure Bonham

06:08.034 --> 06:10.514
to a phony meeting at Hunts Point.

06:10.570 --> 06:13.312
That's like saying somebody picked
his name out of a phone book.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.410
Hey, man, Mr. Bonham gets killed,

06:15.475 --> 06:18.422
I don't see it helps my case. Does it?

06:18.478 --> 06:21.391
Eric, be quiet. It was nice talking to you.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.493
(DOOR LOCK BUZZING)

06:27.654 --> 06:30.828
I wonder how many other inmates
have asked the same question.

06:32.959 --> 06:35.633
If a prosecutor dies during a case?

06:35.996 --> 06:39.637
No inmate's asked for information
on that specific question.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.770
What about the legal issues it would raise?

06:41.835 --> 06:43.974
Most likely the right to a speedy trial.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.641
A Sixth Amendment issue.

06:45.705 --> 06:49.152
Everybody here wants to know
about the Sixth Amendment.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.292
Big caseload, Counselor?

06:57.550 --> 06:59.860
I'm just working on my own case.

07:01.454 --> 07:03.900
Really? You were charged with rape?

07:06.760 --> 07:09.366
You're researching People v. Williams.

07:10.230 --> 07:14.610
That's all about a defendant's
access to a victim's sexual history.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.875
What do you want, Detective?

07:19.940 --> 07:23.820
Have any inmates asked you
about the legal impact

07:23.877 --> 07:27.791
of a prosecutor's untimely death?

07:28.181 --> 07:29.854
That would be privileged information.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.396
There's no privilege for jailhouse lawyers.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.830
I can make the argument there is

07:34.921 --> 07:36.958
if the client had an expectation

07:37.023 --> 07:39.697
his communications with me
would remain confidential.

07:39.759 --> 07:40.931
Oh, brother.

07:40.994 --> 07:44.271
No, actually, Eames, he has a very good point.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.908
But in this case,

07:47.434 --> 07:52.144
rule 1.6 of the ABA
Code of Conduct would apply.

07:52.939 --> 07:56.113
Even if the client told me
of an impending crime,

07:56.810 --> 08:01.156
the code doesn't impose any
affirmative obligation on me.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.488
It's my call.

08:02.549 --> 08:03.994
And the code also says

08:04.050 --> 08:07.588
a lawyer must refrain from
morally reprehensible conduct.

08:07.687 --> 08:10.930
Since you have discretion
to breach the privilege,

08:11.124 --> 08:13.798
not doing so when a life is at stake

08:15.128 --> 08:17.130
is morally reprehensible.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.844
Artie Kahn. He made bail last week.

08:27.574 --> 08:28.746
You called my lawyer, right?

08:28.808 --> 08:30.014
EAMES: We talked to your other lawyer.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.111
Other lawyer?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.621
The one in Rikers. The one you told

08:32.679 --> 08:35.455
you were going to whack your
prosecutor, Peter Bonham.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.392
I never told him that.

08:39.619 --> 08:41.655
I just asked what would happen

08:41.721 --> 08:43.428
if Bonham up and died.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.492
And you said it just like that,

08:45.558 --> 08:49.233
out of intellectual curiosity?

08:50.163 --> 08:51.403
Yeah, out of that.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.740
It just so happens, somebody's
been trying to kill Bonham.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.575
They cut the brakes on his car.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.046
- No way.
- Yeah.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.879
Whoever did this would've gotten
brake fluid on their hands.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.448
Brake fluid leaves a residue.

09:03.510 --> 09:07.287
No matter how much you wash,
you can't get it off.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.792
EAMES: You can't see it either.

09:09.849 --> 09:11.351
You know what this is?

09:11.418 --> 09:12.795
It's a towelette thing.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.729
It's a special towelette thing.

09:15.255 --> 09:19.897
It has a liquid on it that
reacts with brake fluid residue.

09:20.126 --> 09:23.972
If you have any brake fluid residue
on your hands, it shows up.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.775
Go ahead, Artie. Wipe your hands.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.622
I didn't cut no brake line.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.854
Then why the questions about
Bonham dropping dead?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.557
Because two weeks ago I was at Rikers,

09:48.388 --> 09:49.526
on the phone,

09:49.589 --> 09:51.967
and there was a guy on the phone next to me,

09:52.025 --> 09:54.164
talking about Bonham having an accident.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.473
Is it this guy?

09:59.632 --> 10:01.873
I didn't really look, you know.

10:02.902 --> 10:04.074
I had my back to the guy.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.514
You were listening.

10:05.572 --> 10:08.143
What did he say, his exact words?

10:10.944 --> 10:14.892
He was gonna pay good money for
Bonham to have an accident.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.058
A permanent accident.

10:20.019 --> 10:23.000
Did you know that they're shooting
chicken eggs through a shower head,

10:23.056 --> 10:25.900
boiling it, mixing it with sea
brine and calling it caviar?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.545
He said he tried you at the

10:40.607 --> 10:43.087
I'll call him tomorrow. Something wrong?

10:43.143 --> 10:44.451
Well, I can't find the Pomerol.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.047
I asked you to bring it up this morning.

10:46.112 --> 10:47.921
I thought you said any old Merlot.

10:48.515 --> 10:51.325
Could you be a sweetheart
and get it from the cellar?

10:53.786 --> 10:55.493
Sure. Okay.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.294
Oh! We found the best place to buy caviar.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.397

look like a burglary gone bad.

to think he was after.

Burke was feeling lucky. Stopped
by the OTB this afternoon.

worth of bets here.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.774
No. I think the lock's rusted.

Oh, well, it's working fine now.

13:27.373 --> 13:31.344
Well, of course it's working. This man's
a burglar. He knows how to open locks.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.615

13:42.822 --> 13:45.166
We only lock it because of Sara.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.371
Well, how would a burglar know about it?

13:47.427 --> 13:50.965
Oh, we've had workers down there.
They always ask about it.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.909
But you don't think it was a burglary.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.411
No, but he brought burglary tools with him,

13:56.469 --> 13:58.608
maybe to help with the cover story.

14:00.940 --> 14:04.547
We have an ID on the intruder. Gary Burke.

14:04.610 --> 14:07.056
Either of you ever seen him before?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.015
No.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.686
GOREN: You ever prosecute him?

14:10.750 --> 14:14.789
He has along rap sheet, muggings,
drug possession. No burglary.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.460
No, I don't recognize him.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.333
You didn't answer my question.
What's going on here?

14:22.995 --> 14:27.137
Someone's put a contract
out on your husband's life.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.343
You can't be serious!

14:30.837 --> 14:34.375
The phone call, the car, it's all...
it's all part of it.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.516
Oh, my God, Peter.

14:40.012 --> 14:43.459
But he's okay now, right? I mean, he's safe.

14:45.651 --> 14:48.530
It depends on how determined this person is.

14:50.256 --> 14:52.702
And we have no way of knowing that.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.633
LORI: Mr. Sanchez, what are they doing here?

15:00.700 --> 15:01.974
They're cops.

15:02.034 --> 15:03.377
Lori lives here with Gary.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.677
- Where's Gary?
- He's gotten himself into trouble.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.739
What trouble?

15:06.806 --> 15:09.150
The trouble somebody gave him
a lot of money to get into.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.482
I don't know about any money.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.614
The $2 grand he spent at the OTB?

15:12.678 --> 15:16.785
The $3 grand you spent on new
dresses, new shoes, new handbags.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.328
Gary saved up his bar tips.

15:18.384 --> 15:20.557
You're really good at keeping secrets.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.226
Me, I just run off at the mouth.

15:23.289 --> 15:26.702
For example, I'll probably tell
Gary that you were out all evening.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.363
Gary knows I was with my friends.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.668
Look at your hair.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.902
It looks like you just
walked out of the shower.

15:31.964 --> 15:34.570
I know I'm gonna say something
to Gary about your hair.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.171
I went to the gym. I took a shower there.

15:37.236 --> 15:39.273
Really? They let you smoke cigars at the gym?

15:39.338 --> 15:41.215
Because you smell like cigar smoke!

15:41.274 --> 15:43.811
I know I'll just blurt that out to Gary.

15:43.876 --> 15:47.050
Gee, Lori, thanks to my partner's big
mouth, Gary might get the impression

15:47.113 --> 15:50.925
you're fooling around with some guy who
smokes cigars and lets you use his shower.

15:51.984 --> 15:54.760
Please, don't tell him that. He'll hit me.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.064
Okay.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.774
Let's go from the top.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.003
Where did the money come from?

16:10.069 --> 16:11.571
I don't know.

16:11.637 --> 16:16.780
Gary got a lot of calls from this buddy
of his in prison. JoJo Martinez.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.616
Please, you can't tell Gary I said anything.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.888
I don't think you have to
worry about Gary anymore.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.328
Gary Burke was apprehended

16:25.384 --> 16:28.763
while trying to shoot one of
my colleagues, Peter Bonham.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.529
Mr. Burke hasn't yet decided
to cooperate with us,

16:31.591 --> 16:35.061
but we'd like to give your
client first crack at a plea.

16:35.194 --> 16:38.141
A plea? Why? You think he's involved?

16:38.397 --> 16:40.138
CARVER: Yes, we do.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.505
Of course, if he'd rather wait for Mr.
Burke to implicate him...

16:43.569 --> 16:45.014
Give me a minute to talk to my client...

16:45.071 --> 16:47.984
Vince, shut up. They're playing you.

16:48.741 --> 16:49.947
Gary Burke is dead.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.215
EAMES: How do you know that?

16:51.277 --> 16:53.587
PNN, Prison News Network.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.752
That's the same place we get our news from.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.657
Yeah. One of their reporters

17:01.153 --> 17:04.134
heard you on the phone a couple of weeks ago

17:04.190 --> 17:05.863
putting out a contract on Bonham.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.936
Screw that.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.040
Why would I want to hurt that man?

17:12.098 --> 17:14.009
Because he's about to put you away for life?

17:14.066 --> 17:16.478
You're facing your third
felony drug conviction.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.346
Bonham told us he turned you
down for a plea bargain.

17:19.405 --> 17:20.577
That's hardly a motive for murder.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.313
I don't need to kill this
DA to beat this rap.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.015
- JoJo, let me handle...
- Don't "JoJo" me.

17:26.779 --> 17:27.883
The hell with all of you.

17:27.946 --> 17:31.258
That's a nice... What you're wearing.

17:31.551 --> 17:35.522
(STUTTERING) I mean, where'd you get
that from? Is that from Peru?

17:36.122 --> 17:40.696
What do they call that? A serap... A serape.

17:40.760 --> 17:41.761
No, it's a...

17:41.827 --> 17:45.707
(STUTTERING)
S-s-s-sweater.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.770
It's a sweater.

17:50.136 --> 17:52.082
Right. Somebody make that for you?

17:57.777 --> 17:59.518
(DOOR LOCK BUZZING)

18:03.282 --> 18:05.762
I was reviewing Mr. Martinez's case file,

18:05.818 --> 18:09.766
and I noticed you missed a filing deadline
on a motion to suppress drug evidence.

18:09.855 --> 18:12.233
He specifically asked me not to file it.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.497
CARVER: And why would he do that?

18:13.559 --> 18:16.938
I don't know. I tried to talk
to his mother about it.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.308
What does she have to do with it?

18:19.365 --> 18:22.209
She's paying his legal bills.
$200 bucks a week.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.442
Or I should say, she was.
She stopped three weeks ago.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.677
But I still have to do what Martinez says.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.530
It sounds like JoJo's getting
ready to cut him loose.

18:40.586 --> 18:43.624
That only makes sense if he's
trading up for a better lawyer.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.669
Better lawyers cost more than $200 a week.

18:45.725 --> 18:46.726
It begs the question

18:46.792 --> 18:50.001
where is Mr. Martinez getting the money
to pay for better representation?

18:50.062 --> 18:52.565
Same place Gary Burke got his money?

18:55.301 --> 18:57.178
JoJo's mom might know.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.051
I don't know anything about a new lawyer.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.745
I just do what my son tells me.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.186
He asked you to stop paying Mr. Quitoriano?

19:05.244 --> 19:07.087
I just got behind, that's all.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.995
You made JoJo's sweater.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.859
He was wearing it when we were talking
to him. It's a nice-looking sweater.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.863
This one's even more stunning.

19:21.894 --> 19:26.138
Eames, look at the sleeve.

19:28.234 --> 19:32.046
This raglan sleeve is laid in so effortlessly.

19:32.104 --> 19:36.917
Under the seam, at the armpit,
it's like a little pouch?

19:36.976 --> 19:39.252
I see it. You can hide something in there.

19:39.311 --> 19:43.225
Hmm, and there's another one in this sleeve.

19:43.282 --> 19:46.889
Just big enough for messages,

19:47.820 --> 19:50.027
money, drugs.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.699
You don't tell us the truth,

19:51.757 --> 19:53.828
you could have your visiting
privileges revoked.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.533
Please, it was just messages.

19:56.595 --> 19:57.972
What was in those messages?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.703
Were they about the new lawyer?

19:59.765 --> 20:01.244
I don't look.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.642
But JoJo did get a new lawyer.

20:05.504 --> 20:06.949
How is he paying for it?

20:07.006 --> 20:08.747
He said it wouldn't cost anything.

20:08.808 --> 20:12.756
That the lawyer would work for free.
He said she's the best.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.819
The new lawyer's a woman. What's her name?

20:15.881 --> 20:17.224
I don't know.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.762
JoJo said she can fix everything

20:18.818 --> 20:20.889
when she gets back from California.

20:22.354 --> 20:25.699
All right, Mrs. Martinez. Thank you.

20:27.526 --> 20:30.530
And no more sweaters, okay?

20:32.264 --> 20:35.507
Bonham's wife was supposed to
be in San Francisco next week.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.209
JoJo's new lawyer.

20:37.269 --> 20:39.271
JoJo's payback for having her husband killed.

20:39.338 --> 20:41.113
Talk about pro bono.

20:45.311 --> 20:47.416
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

20:58.824 --> 21:00.565
Oh, hi, sweetheart.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.167
I didn't know you knew Alfonzo.

21:03.229 --> 21:05.470
John? Just from court.

21:05.531 --> 21:08.137
He was just asking me
about the shooting, so...

21:08.534 --> 21:09.569
Oh.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.705
I have a hearing in an hour.
Do you wanna get lunch?

21:12.772 --> 21:14.649
Peter, can I talk to you?

21:14.707 --> 21:18.052
The police suspect Martinez is connected
to this attempt on your life.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.522
Their suspicions are completely
without merit, of course,

21:20.579 --> 21:24.686
but, regardless, I want you to recuse
yourself from Martinez's drug case.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.787
That's not necessary. I can remain objective.

21:26.852 --> 21:29.731
Who are you kidding? They think
he tried to have you killed.

21:30.589 --> 21:32.660
Linda, could you explain to
your husband why he should...

21:32.725 --> 21:33.965
Don't talk to her!

21:34.026 --> 21:36.438
You wanna have me relieved,
make an application.

21:36.495 --> 21:39.135
Unless a judge tells me,
I am not stepping down.

21:42.601 --> 21:43.773
(EXHALING)

21:44.770 --> 21:47.614
Peter, I don't think that
he was being unreasonable.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.277
Can we just get lunch?

21:49.341 --> 21:53.983
I can't, actually, I have a deposition
at 1:00. So, I'll see you tonight.

22:02.288 --> 22:06.600
Linda Bonham's involvement would explain
how Gary Burke got into their house

22:06.659 --> 22:08.400
using a door with a rusted lock.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.532
Not to mention, she was working hard
to sell the burglary cover story.

22:11.597 --> 22:14.237
She's one of the most respected
trial attorneys in the city.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.678
She is married to a second-rate prosecutor.

22:16.735 --> 22:20.080
She may be ready to trade up
to something better.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.641
That's what divorces are for.

22:21.707 --> 22:24.415
She's the bread-winner, she'd
end up paying him alimony.

22:24.810 --> 22:29.316
Until you present me with
incontrovertible proof that she's involved,

22:29.748 --> 22:31.421
I will not be applying for warrants,

22:31.483 --> 22:34.953
issuing subpoenas nor presenting
evidence to a grand jury.

22:35.487 --> 22:37.899
I will not embarrass Peter Bonham.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.171
(SIGHING)

22:47.833 --> 22:51.645
So, Linda sent poor Peter down to
the cellar to fetch the Pomerol

22:51.704 --> 22:54.241
and that's when the bullets started flying.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.013
It was her idea to send him down there?

22:56.075 --> 22:57.383
Yes.

22:57.443 --> 22:58.888
How well did you know the Bonhams?

22:58.944 --> 22:59.979
Oh, not well.

23:00.045 --> 23:03.822
I met Linda at a brunch.
We had common interests.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.726
Linda Bonham's interest is in the fact

23:05.784 --> 23:08.458
that Allison's sister is on the
board of the Canterbury School.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.090
She's trying to get her daughter admitted.

23:10.155 --> 23:12.692
I already told her they live
far too east of Park Avenue

23:12.758 --> 23:14.294
to stand a chance of being admitted.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.136
Being partner in her law firm
doesn't count for anything?

23:17.196 --> 23:20.837
Well, some law partnerships
are forged in the courtroom,

23:20.900 --> 23:23.141
- some in the boardroom...
- And the bedroom?

23:23.202 --> 23:25.273
Oh, Jerry, knock it off.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.817
Oh, no, please, my partner
loves rumor and innuendo.

23:28.307 --> 23:29.650
JERRY: Don't take my word for it.

23:29.708 --> 23:31.381
Ask Rodney Brooks.

23:31.443 --> 23:34.083
He's a litigator at Linda's old law firm,

23:34.146 --> 23:37.753
and I'm told that he was one of her
stepping stones two years ago.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.860
I was a jerk, okay?

23:41.921 --> 23:45.027
Linda had just moved to a
new firm and made partner.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.434
People were envious, they
were taking shots at her...

23:47.493 --> 23:49.370
She slept her way to the
top, that sort of thing?

23:49.428 --> 23:52.170
Right. So, one night at the cigar club,

23:52.231 --> 23:56.202
I don't know, I had one Gibson
too many, I made up a story.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.805
You know, like I said, I was a jerk.

24:00.839 --> 24:04.946
Linda's successful because she
is smart and ambitious. Okay?

24:06.045 --> 24:07.888
You handle civil lawsuits, right?

24:07.947 --> 24:09.551
Ms. Bonham ever work with you?

24:09.615 --> 24:11.959
Sometimes. She's good at prepping witnesses.

24:12.017 --> 24:13.997
I work mostly with expert witnesses.

24:14.053 --> 24:17.125
But ordinary citizens who've
never been on the stand before,

24:17.189 --> 24:18.600
Linda was the best.

24:19.625 --> 24:22.469
You ever work with a witness
named JoJo Martinez?

24:22.528 --> 24:24.565
BROOKS: I wouldn't remember.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.109
He stuttered.

24:28.267 --> 24:29.905
That rings a bell.

24:30.769 --> 24:35.650
Sure, about four years ago,
a landlord-tenant suit.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.184
I don't remember the guy's name,

24:37.242 --> 24:39.188
but Linda helped him get over his stutter.

24:39.979 --> 24:43.222
Could you dig up a file on him by
tomorrow? We could send someone over.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.659
Oh, sure.

24:47.152 --> 24:50.361
Martinez's hesitation before words
starting with the letter "S"?

24:50.422 --> 24:52.231
It's the mark of a former stutterer.

24:53.759 --> 24:56.569
That's his name on the witness
list for the lawsuit.

24:56.628 --> 24:58.403
That's how he knows Ms. Bonham.

24:58.464 --> 25:01.001
That's how she came to hire
him to kill her husband

25:01.066 --> 25:04.104
in return for money and
future legal representation.

25:24.923 --> 25:27.597
I'm sure it's just routine.
You know how the police...

25:27.659 --> 25:30.003
They questioned our friends, my colleagues,

25:30.062 --> 25:32.201
they're trading in gossip, it's humiliating.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.506
they wouldn't be doing this to you.

They're doing it to you, too,

is even aware that...

25:50.182 --> 25:51.217
What do you want?

25:51.283 --> 25:53.695
Linda Bonham, we have a
warrant for your arrest.

25:53.752 --> 25:55.663
What? What possible grounds could you have?

25:55.721 --> 25:56.791
I wanna see the warrant.

25:56.855 --> 25:58.198
EAMES: Put your hands
behind your back, please.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.998
For God's sake, is that necessary?

26:00.059 --> 26:01.231
It's for her own protection.

26:01.293 --> 26:04.240
Peter, it doesn't matter. Just call
Bill Stanton, tell him what's happening,

26:04.296 --> 26:05.775
and tell Sara that I am at work.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.910
She'll be at the Major Case Squad.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.546
You're insane to think that
I would ever hurt Peter.

26:14.606 --> 26:17.052
The insanity is you thinking
you'd get away with it.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.645
But I have no motive!

26:19.078 --> 26:23.549
I'm sure we'll find it, maybe in one of these.

26:24.683 --> 26:28.187
All your electronic gizmos.

26:30.222 --> 26:33.533
Maybe we'll find a boyfriend's number

26:33.592 --> 26:36.903
or a message that you forgot to delete.

26:36.962 --> 26:40.136
You know what confounds me?
With all these gizmos,

26:40.199 --> 26:42.611
people still think they
can get away with murder.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.382
What's more confounding is sometimes they do.

27:04.356 --> 27:09.135
Your phone has a display for caller ID?

27:10.162 --> 27:11.232
Yes.

27:12.297 --> 27:17.212
When you get a call, you check
the display before answering it?

27:17.703 --> 27:20.274
Yes. I don't understand - what...

27:22.374 --> 27:24.251
You screen your calls.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.396
Excuse us a minute.

27:48.934 --> 27:51.540
Peter Bonham got a call
that his wife had passed out,

27:51.603 --> 27:53.640
the call to lure him
to the abandoned building.

27:53.705 --> 27:55.981
He called her to see if she was all right.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.850
He called her on her cell phone.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.785
His number would've been
displayed on her phone.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.292
She would've seen it was him calling.

28:03.348 --> 28:07.763
If she was really involved in a
scheme to lure him to his death...

28:07.819 --> 28:09.389
She wouldn't have answered her phone.

28:09.454 --> 28:12.128
That's right, she wouldn't. But she did.

28:13.058 --> 28:15.265
Because she didn't know about any scheme.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.170
It's him.

28:19.698 --> 28:23.043
He's framing her. He wants to get rid of her.

28:23.502 --> 28:25.778
Divorce is out of the question,
he wouldn't get a dime.

28:25.837 --> 28:28.443
And he can't have her killed,
he'd be the obvious suspect.

28:28.507 --> 28:30.544
But he can send her to jail for life.

28:30.609 --> 28:33.886
So far it's working, all the
evidence points to her.

28:35.981 --> 28:38.120
It won't be easy to get him.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.358
He can't know we're on to him.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.999
Martinez said he got $20,000 to
arrange the hit on Peter Bonham.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.007
We just wanna trace it to Linda Bonham.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.838
Just dotting all the "I's."

28:52.898 --> 28:54.775
Let me know what you come up with.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.310
How long are we keeping him in the dark?

28:59.371 --> 29:02.648
Until we have an incontrovertible
case against Peter Bonham.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.449
Starting with tracing
the $20,000 back to him.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.319
I'm just finding the usual checks,

29:07.379 --> 29:11.054
groceries, mortgage, doctor.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.388
Which doctor?

29:13.619 --> 29:15.963
A Dr. David Kipper on Park Avenue.

29:16.021 --> 29:18.160
He was writing him checks every month.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.295
Yeah.

29:23.662 --> 29:27.906
I've got 11 charges on Bonham's credit card

29:27.966 --> 29:31.539
to Kipper in the last year. Yeah.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.012
Look at the deposits made
to the Bonham's account.

29:36.441 --> 29:40.082
Just the same amount every couple
of weeks. Probably paychecks.

29:41.046 --> 29:44.550
Bonham's covered under the
same city medical plan we are.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.061
He pays the doctor,

29:46.118 --> 29:49.190
the insurance company sends
him a reimbursement check.

29:49.254 --> 29:52.463
Well, there's no record
he deposited those checks.

30:01.733 --> 30:02.871
(SIGHING)

30:02.934 --> 30:04.743
She's finally asleep.

30:06.938 --> 30:09.282
Maybe we should have her
stay up at my mother's.

30:09.341 --> 30:12.322
I'm worried that she'll hear
things at her school.

30:12.377 --> 30:14.288
It's pre-school, Linda.

30:14.413 --> 30:18.225
They talk about Sponge Bob,
not stuff like this.

30:27.159 --> 30:31.938
Peter, if you want me to sleep in
the guest room, I'll understand.

30:31.997 --> 30:35.809
No, no. Don't be silly.

30:39.938 --> 30:41.383
Sweetheart,

30:44.309 --> 30:46.289
I need to tell you this.

30:46.912 --> 30:50.291
I have never cheated on you. Never.

30:50.949 --> 30:52.553
You know that, don't you?

30:53.618 --> 30:56.326
Sure, of course.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.459
And the police said that I was ashamed of you.

30:58.523 --> 31:02.528
I mean, that's just not true. I have
always admired you for what you do.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.164
You don't have to say anything.

31:04.229 --> 31:07.142
And when I made partner, I was happy for us,

31:07.232 --> 31:10.236
it just meant that our life
would be better. And Sara's.

31:28.787 --> 31:29.993
The insurance company says

31:30.055 --> 31:33.093
two years ago Bonham stopped
depositing the reimbursement checks

31:33.158 --> 31:35.968
and started just cashing them.
He's been hoarding the money.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.463
How much are we talking about?

31:37.529 --> 31:38.906
About $25,000.

31:38.964 --> 31:42.741
All from routine doctor's visits,
check-ups, little aches and pains.

31:42.801 --> 31:46.772
He's used his insurance money to
build a war chest to frame his wife.

31:46.872 --> 31:48.317
Two years ago

31:48.373 --> 31:52.253
Bonham won a conviction over
George Kolinsky for a drug case.

31:52.811 --> 31:54.381
Kolinsky got 20 years.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.722
Hired a new lawyer and appealed.

31:57.682 --> 31:59.184
The conviction was overturned,

31:59.251 --> 32:01.094
most of the charges were set aside.

32:01.153 --> 32:03.497
Kolinsky ended up serving a year.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.658
All thanks to his new lawyer.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.203
Linda Bonham.

32:07.859 --> 32:10.601
The guy's a prosecutor. He knows
losing a case is part of the game.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.801
There's losing. And then
there's losing to your wife.

32:12.864 --> 32:16.277
And then there's getting your
balls handed to you on a platter.

32:16.334 --> 32:18.473
His wife had just made partner,

32:18.537 --> 32:20.608
there were rumors of infidelities.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.208
The guy stayed with her for two years,

32:22.274 --> 32:25.551
sleeping in the same bed,
just waiting for payback?

32:25.610 --> 32:30.650
This guy's a poster boy for
passive-aggressive personality disorder.

32:30.715 --> 32:35.664
He doesn't confront his wife, he doesn't
argue with her, he doesn't contradict her.

32:35.954 --> 32:39.367
Instead he uses us, the police,

32:39.424 --> 32:41.597
the DA's office to nail her.

32:46.331 --> 32:47.674
It's time we let Mr. Carver know

32:47.732 --> 32:49.143
he's prosecuting the wrong person.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.772
We can't tell him without Bonham finding out.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.741
You want me to keep Carver out of the loop?

32:57.175 --> 33:00.213
Okay. We'll tell him when we're ready.

33:00.645 --> 33:01.953
Any idea when that will be?

33:02.013 --> 33:04.391
Bonham's done a great job of burying his wife.

33:04.449 --> 33:08.022
There is someone who might be
able to help us dig her out.

33:08.353 --> 33:09.855
JoJo Martinez.

33:11.056 --> 33:13.002
QUITORIANO: My client laid
everything out in his statement.

33:13.058 --> 33:15.800
He called Miss Bonham twice. That's
when she told him what she wanted.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.568
She sent the money to his mother,

33:17.629 --> 33:20.166
and Gary Burke collected his
share from Mrs. Martinez.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.542
How did you know when to call Miss Bonham?

33:22.601 --> 33:26.174
She s-s-sent the notes to my mother

33:26.238 --> 33:28.218
with the phone number and when to call.

33:28.273 --> 33:30.913
The notes your mother sewed into the sweaters?

33:30.976 --> 33:32.978
My mother didn't know what was going down.

33:33.044 --> 33:35.490
EAMES: The number you
called, you still have it?

33:36.047 --> 33:38.755
No. It was different numbers both times.

33:39.150 --> 33:41.494
C-c-cell phone numbers.

33:47.459 --> 33:51.737
How did you know it was Ms.
Bonham that you were talking to?

33:53.298 --> 33:56.575
I mean, did you recognize her voice?

33:56.835 --> 34:00.908
No. She just s-s-said who she was.

34:02.974 --> 34:05.716
And it was the same lady both times?

34:06.344 --> 34:11.020
I guess. I don't know. The s-s-second
time she called she said she had a cold.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.860
Was there any chit-chat or just business?

34:17.922 --> 34:21.563
Just business. She told me what she
wanted me to do and that was that.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.274
EAMES: The numbers he called were
probably prepaid cell phones.

34:31.335 --> 34:32.337
Untraceable.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.507
And the woman he talked to?

34:33.572 --> 34:34.777
Most likely two different women.

34:34.839 --> 34:37.478
Most likely prostitutes Bonham
hired for the occasion.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.920
The times the calls were
made corresponded to times

34:39.978 --> 34:41.422
when Linda Bonham was home alone.

34:41.478 --> 34:45.085
With no verifiable alibi.
Bonham thought of everything.

34:47.552 --> 34:48.895
What's that?

34:48.954 --> 34:52.094
It's Martinez's statement. I'm improving it.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.038
3 calls?

34:57.094 --> 34:58.870
Didn't you just tell me Martinez made 2 calls?

34:58.930 --> 35:00.841
Well, now he's made 3.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.935
I need to get this re-typed.

35:06.771 --> 35:10.378
Don't expect me to beg for a plea
bargain for something that I didn't do!

35:10.442 --> 35:13.355
Miss Bonham, I'm offering
this out of consideration...

35:13.411 --> 35:14.583
I'm innocent.

35:14.679 --> 35:17.922
I know you hear it from defendants
all the time, but I am innocent.

35:17.983 --> 35:19.758
We have Mr. Martinez's statement.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.422
He says he talked to you.

35:21.486 --> 35:23.227
It's just not true.

35:24.756 --> 35:27.100
Let's show her the statement.

35:28.960 --> 35:32.965
It's on the second page when he
talks about the phone calls.

35:35.033 --> 35:37.445
He lists the calls, date and time.

35:37.702 --> 35:39.375
If there's anyone who can verify

35:39.437 --> 35:41.849
you didn't get the calls, tell us.

35:43.208 --> 35:45.415
Well, these first two,
I might have been alone.

35:47.245 --> 35:50.317
But this third one, I remember
this Sunday, I was with Peter.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.293
We went to Connecticut for a drive.

35:52.350 --> 35:53.954
- You sure?
- Yes, yes.

35:54.019 --> 35:57.557
We talked about getting a summer rental.

35:57.622 --> 36:00.796
We even got lobster rolls at a food stand.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.566
Ask Peter. I did not get a phone call.

36:02.627 --> 36:04.163
This whole thing is a pack of lies.

36:04.229 --> 36:07.870
Well, we'll certainly
look into it, Ms. Bonham.

36:08.099 --> 36:09.737
Why not ask Peter right now?

36:09.801 --> 36:14.045
Yes, ask him! Please, just ask him.

36:29.487 --> 36:32.400
It's Ron. Could you come down to the office?

36:34.025 --> 36:35.629
Yeah, thank you.

36:52.410 --> 36:55.448
This date here. It's a Sunday.

36:55.814 --> 36:59.557
That's one of the times Martinez
said he talked to your wife.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.692
Do you remember where you
were that afternoon?

37:05.557 --> 37:08.470
I was with Sara in Central Park.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.304
With Linda?

37:18.303 --> 37:20.909
No. She stayed home.

37:21.873 --> 37:24.149
So, you weren't in Connecticut?

37:33.017 --> 37:35.395
Peter, don't you remember?

37:36.221 --> 37:39.031
We stopped to eat right outside of Guilford.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.592
CARVER: Ms. Bonham, I'm sorry.

37:40.658 --> 37:43.468
Peter, what's the matter?
You have to remember.

37:43.528 --> 37:45.007
- Linda, let's go.
- No.

37:45.063 --> 37:47.168
- LINDA: Peter.
- Linda, please.

37:48.666 --> 37:52.375
We dug for clams with Sara.

38:00.845 --> 38:05.157
Oh, my God, no, you...
You son of a bitch, you...

38:05.617 --> 38:07.824
STANTON: That's enough, Linda.

38:08.353 --> 38:11.493
Oh, my God! How could you?

38:21.166 --> 38:22.611
I need to...

38:24.269 --> 38:25.839
Now she knows.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.748
She knows it was you.

38:30.341 --> 38:32.014
What's he talking about?

38:32.110 --> 38:34.716
What are you talking about, Detective?

38:36.681 --> 38:39.161
Well, you just couldn't resist.

38:42.353 --> 38:43.423
Resist what?

38:43.488 --> 38:46.958
Letting his wife know that
he's the one who framed her.

38:48.893 --> 38:50.099
What?

38:50.195 --> 38:51.799
That's not true.

38:52.130 --> 38:57.136
Martinez never said that he
called your wife that Sunday.

38:59.704 --> 39:03.675
That was me. I revised the statement.

39:05.109 --> 39:09.285
The truth is, is Linda was
in Connecticut with you.

39:09.781 --> 39:13.695
Not only did you stop for
food, you stopped for gas.

39:17.255 --> 39:18.791
$12 worth.

39:23.061 --> 39:26.634
It's right here on his credit card bill.

39:29.267 --> 39:33.579
GOREN: Maybe you forgot. Maybe you didn't.

39:34.706 --> 39:38.415
But you could either confirm
your wife's alibi

39:39.611 --> 39:41.955
or confirm Martinez's statement.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.891
It's a tough choice.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.397
Oh, I see.

39:52.924 --> 39:56.167
It was brilliant, Peter.

39:58.596 --> 40:00.769
You put that little wife
of yours in her place.

40:00.832 --> 40:04.871
Her and her big salary,
her successful law practice.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.980
All the things that she accomplished

40:10.041 --> 40:14.353
with no regard for you,
for your... your feelings.

40:15.680 --> 40:18.092
When she took the Kolinsky appeal,

40:18.650 --> 40:20.755
how did she rationalize it?

40:22.253 --> 40:23.391
Did she tell you

40:23.454 --> 40:27.231
that there were important
constitutional issues at stake?

40:28.059 --> 40:32.940
And when she beat you, did she go "Aw,
shucks, honey, it's not personal."

40:38.403 --> 40:41.543
Who was she kidding? It was personal.

40:45.910 --> 40:47.548
She crushed you.

40:49.147 --> 40:52.492
And not in the privacy of your
own home but in a courtroom.

40:52.550 --> 40:56.293
In front of your colleagues, in
front of the whole legal community.

41:03.828 --> 41:05.330
Not only that,

41:08.466 --> 41:10.446
it's on the damn record.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.474
There.

41:14.806 --> 41:18.413
Where law students,

41:18.476 --> 41:20.820
lawyers, judges,

41:21.679 --> 41:24.523
your friends and neighbors

41:26.884 --> 41:28.921
can read about it

41:28.987 --> 41:32.332
from now until eternity.

41:36.728 --> 41:40.005
Everyone knew. Everyone.

41:42.867 --> 41:47.839
They would look at her
and then they look at me.

41:53.177 --> 41:57.717
My own daughter looks at me
like I'm some kind of a joke.

42:14.332 --> 42:18.781
Well, you showed her, didn't you?

42:25.243 --> 42:27.723
Peter Bonham, you're under arrest for murder.

42:30.314 --> 42:32.453
(SIGHING)

42:47.799 --> 42:51.144
How long had you suspected?

42:51.202 --> 42:54.672
Only a few days. We couldn't take
the risk of him finding out.

42:54.739 --> 42:58.744
Please, no explanations.
I've got to first deal with Peter Bonham.

42:58.810 --> 43:02.257
But I will get back to you, Detective.

43:10.855 --> 43:13.836
He'll get over it. Just like Peter Bonham.
