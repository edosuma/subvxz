00:27.845 --> 00:33.017
When a man loves a woman

00:33.142 --> 00:36.729
Can't keep his mind
on nothin' else

00:36.854 --> 00:42.402
He'd change the world for
the good thing he's found

00:42.527 --> 00:47.782
If she is mad he can see it

00:47.865 --> 00:51.494
She can do no wrong

00:51.619 --> 00:53.705
Turn his back
on his best friend

00:53.830 --> 00:57.041
If he put her down

00:57.166 --> 01:02.547
When a man loves a woman

01:02.630 --> 01:06.342
Spend his very last dime

01:06.426 --> 01:11.973
Tryin' to hold on
to what he needs

01:12.098 --> 01:17.270
He'd give up all his comforts

01:17.395 --> 01:21.232
And sleep out in the rain

01:21.315 --> 01:25.987
If she said that's the way
it ought to be

01:29.240 --> 01:33.661
Well, this man loves you, woman

01:36.622 --> 01:41.461
I'd give you everything I had

01:43.504 --> 01:49.802
Tryin' to hold on
to your high-class love

01:49.927 --> 01:56.142
Baby, please don't treat me bad

01:56.267 --> 02:01.939
When a man loves a woman

02:02.023 --> 02:05.652
Down deep in his soul

02:05.735 --> 02:10.031
She can bring him such misery

02:11.240 --> 02:16.704
If she plays him for a fool

02:16.829 --> 02:19.290
He's the last one to know

02:20.500 --> 02:25.922
Lovin' eyes can never see

02:26.047 --> 02:29.217
When a man loves a woman

02:29.300 --> 02:32.136
Right.

02:32.261 --> 02:35.640
Right. That...

02:35.723 --> 02:38.434
and that.

02:38.518 --> 02:41.479
And that is cricket, hon.

02:43.940 --> 02:46.401
Do you want it?

02:46.484 --> 02:48.611
Sure.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.989
Doesn't matter if you don't.

02:51.114 --> 02:55.410
You know, I won't be offended.
Jody's never offended.

02:55.493 --> 02:58.413
- What you say your name was?
- Jude.

02:58.496 --> 03:02.125
Jude. Why,
that suits you, Jude.

03:02.250 --> 03:05.086
- The teddy bear?
- No! Fuck this bear.

03:05.128 --> 03:08.464
The name: Jude.

03:08.548 --> 03:11.467
And it is Jude, right?

03:13.761 --> 03:16.681
I gotta piss, Jude.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.766
Over here.

03:18.891 --> 03:21.728
Jude in June

03:21.853 --> 03:25.314
Jude, my baby

03:25.440 --> 03:28.276
I said Baby, baby

03:28.359 --> 03:30.653
Here. Don't run off, Jude.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.655
You don't know me, do ya?

03:32.780 --> 03:35.158
- What if I did?
- You'd know I wouldn't run off.

03:40.872 --> 03:45.501
- Never pissed holdin' a girl's hand, Jude.
- Ya didn't?

03:45.585 --> 03:48.921
- You know what?
- Tell me, Jody.

03:49.047 --> 03:51.424
It's nice.

03:54.677 --> 03:56.721
Not here.

03:56.846 --> 03:59.766
- Who gives a fuck?
- Ya never know.

03:59.849 --> 04:01.893
I never know nothing.

04:02.018 --> 04:05.938
- People. They could be lookin'.
- Let 'em look.

04:33.424 --> 04:36.761
- Come and get me, soldier.
- Whatever you say, Jude.

04:38.638 --> 04:41.099
I said Baby, baby

04:41.224 --> 04:44.018
Baby, whatcha doin' to me

04:46.688 --> 04:48.523
I said Baby, baby

04:48.648 --> 04:51.818
Baby, whatcha doin' to me

04:58.074 --> 05:01.202
What the fuck...

05:01.285 --> 05:03.538
Get off. Get off.

05:03.621 --> 05:06.082
Get it on! Get it on.

05:09.711 --> 05:12.588
Come on!

05:17.176 --> 05:20.096
Jude!

05:21.681 --> 05:23.808
She wears that
silk blue sweater

05:23.933 --> 05:27.186
She likes to wear
her stockings black

05:34.235 --> 05:36.738
So, what's your name, soldier?

05:36.821 --> 05:40.283
- Fuck you.
- Yeah.

06:29.248 --> 06:31.751
The situation is simple.

06:31.876 --> 06:35.088
You're being held hostage
by the Irish Republican Army.

06:35.213 --> 06:39.300
They've got one of our senior members
under interrogation in Castlereagh.

06:39.384 --> 06:43.429
We've informed 'em that if they don't
release him within three days...

06:43.554 --> 06:46.432
you'll be shot.

06:47.433 --> 06:49.936
You'll be treated as our guest
until further developments.

06:50.061 --> 06:51.938
Have you anything to say?

06:54.107 --> 06:57.694
Give him a cup of tea.

06:57.819 --> 07:00.863
You want a cup of tea?

07:13.251 --> 07:15.128
Thanks, Jude.

07:16.212 --> 07:19.132
See does he want some.

07:19.257 --> 07:21.718
Do you want some food?

07:32.854 --> 07:35.565
Hey.

07:35.690 --> 07:39.527
What's he like?

07:39.610 --> 07:42.447
Horny bastard.

07:46.159 --> 07:48.828
Did you give him it?

07:48.911 --> 07:53.124
There're certain things
I wouldn't do for my country.

07:56.210 --> 07:58.796
Have a look at him.

07:58.921 --> 08:00.882
Can't.

08:00.965 --> 08:05.219
Poke him or somethin'.
See if he's still alive.

08:05.303 --> 08:10.308
- He's all right.
- Hasn't moved for twelve hours.

08:12.185 --> 08:14.395
Go on. Have a heart.

08:34.164 --> 08:36.958
You fucking bitch!
You fucking bitch!

08:37.043 --> 08:38.836
You fucking whore!

08:38.961 --> 08:41.839
You fucking whore!

08:41.964 --> 08:44.342
Give me a knife!
I'll cut his fuckin' heart out!

08:44.467 --> 08:46.928
Give me a knife! Jesus!

08:57.647 --> 08:59.732
You all right?

08:59.857 --> 09:02.527
- Fuckin' animal.
- Come on, Jude.

09:02.610 --> 09:06.322
What do you mean "Come on"?
I had him all over me!

09:06.447 --> 09:09.826
Yeah.

09:09.909 --> 09:14.831
- Tough work, that.
- Well, someone's gotta do it.

09:16.541 --> 09:19.335
Nah, it was a breeze.

09:19.419 --> 09:22.922
I just thought of you.

09:23.047 --> 09:26.926
- You know what, Fergus?
- What?

09:27.051 --> 09:30.596
One of you made me want it.

09:30.722 --> 09:33.141
Which one?

09:42.817 --> 09:46.779
Hold it there. To your left.

09:49.198 --> 09:52.118
Walk on. It's okay.

09:54.370 --> 09:57.457
Around, around to your left.

10:00.043 --> 10:03.129
Gonna open the door.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.548
Move to your left.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.926
Walk in. That's it.

10:09.052 --> 10:13.973
Listen, soldier, you
should eat somethin'.

10:14.098 --> 10:17.643
- Can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

10:17.769 --> 10:21.856
I can't eat
through a canvas bag.

10:25.026 --> 10:28.279
Okay. Okay.

10:28.404 --> 10:31.282
Here.

10:35.620 --> 10:39.082
Fuckin' hell, man!
This is a farce!

10:39.207 --> 10:44.420
- How is it a farce?
- I seen your fucking face!

10:44.504 --> 10:47.382
So, what do I look like?

10:47.465 --> 10:52.470
You're the one about 5'10"
with the killer smile...

10:52.595 --> 10:54.722
and the baby face.

10:54.847 --> 10:57.433
- Oh, am I?
- Yeah.

10:57.517 --> 11:01.437
And the brown eyes.

11:01.562 --> 11:03.523
You're the handsome one.

11:13.241 --> 11:16.703
- Thank you, handsome.
- My pleasure.

11:24.252 --> 11:27.672
I can't fuckin' breathe, man.

11:27.797 --> 11:31.342
Be a Christian, will ya?

11:33.344 --> 11:36.347
Tell him to take
the hood off, honey.

11:36.472 --> 11:38.766
How'd you know it was her?

11:38.891 --> 11:42.729
I can smell her perfume.

11:42.812 --> 11:46.274
See, if we took the hood off,
we'd have to shoot you.

11:46.357 --> 11:49.152
As it is, you got
a fifty-fifty chance.

11:49.277 --> 11:51.612
I thought you liked me,
you bitch.

11:51.738 --> 11:54.949
It was fun while it lasted.

11:55.074 --> 11:57.327
Nice lady.

11:59.871 --> 12:04.250
Please, man. I'm suffocatin' in here.
Take it off.

12:04.375 --> 12:09.464
- Can we not take it off?
- Have to check with himself.

12:11.758 --> 12:14.344
Here. You mind him.

12:14.469 --> 12:16.929
Don't leave me with her, man!

12:17.055 --> 12:20.683
She's dangerous!

12:25.313 --> 12:28.232
Peter? Can I take
the prisoner's hood off?

12:28.316 --> 12:30.234
Why do you want to do that?

12:30.318 --> 12:32.570
- Poor whore's suffocatin' in the heat.
- So?

12:32.654 --> 12:35.156
- Anyway, he's seen our faces.
- He's seen your face.

12:35.281 --> 12:39.327
Yeah, and he saw Jude as well.
Peter...

12:39.452 --> 12:41.704
If you don't mind him seein',
I don't mind;

12:41.788 --> 12:44.707
- But you're the only one he looks at.
- Right. Thanks.

12:44.791 --> 12:47.710
It's your decision.

12:52.215 --> 12:56.219
- Leave him to me, Jude.
- My pleasure.

13:22.412 --> 13:25.623
Thank you, soldier.

13:29.836 --> 13:32.672
Never thought fresh air
would taste this good.

13:35.842 --> 13:39.137
Now, if you loose up my hands,
I could feed myself.

13:39.262 --> 13:42.098
No fuckin' way.

13:42.181 --> 13:45.268
I'm only joking.

13:46.686 --> 13:50.356
You know, I was wrong
about one thing.

13:50.481 --> 13:54.277
- And what's that?
- You're no pinup.

13:54.402 --> 13:58.114
- No?
- No. You're not handsome at all.

13:58.239 --> 14:01.159
- Are you tryin' to hurt my feelings?
- No.

14:01.284 --> 14:05.621
- It's the truth.
- I could say the same thing about you.

14:05.705 --> 14:08.166
- Could you?
- But I won't.

14:08.249 --> 14:14.130
- We're more polite around these parts.
- So I've noticed.

14:15.840 --> 14:19.886
- Hey.
- What is it now?

14:20.011 --> 14:22.847
You're gonna have
to do it, aren't you?

14:22.930 --> 14:27.518
- Do what?
- Kill me.

14:27.602 --> 14:30.480
What makes you think that?

14:30.605 --> 14:33.650
They're not gonna
let that guy out...

14:33.775 --> 14:36.527
and you're gonna have
to kill me.

14:36.611 --> 14:38.905
- They'll let him out.
- You want to bet?

14:38.988 --> 14:42.367
- I'm not a gamblin' man.
- And even if they do...

14:42.492 --> 14:45.244
you can't just let me loose.

14:45.328 --> 14:48.414
- Why can't we?
- Not your nature.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.416
What do you know
about my nature?

14:50.541 --> 14:53.127
I'm talkin' 'bout
your people, not you.

14:53.211 --> 14:57.006
What the fuck do you know
about my people?

14:57.131 --> 15:00.343
Only that you're all tough,
undeluded motherfuckers...

15:00.468 --> 15:03.513
and it's not in your nature
to let me go!

15:03.596 --> 15:07.517
Shut the fuck up, would ya?

15:13.564 --> 15:15.483
Here.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.652
You know a funny thing?

15:17.777 --> 15:22.865
- No. What's the funny thing?
- I didn't even fancy her.

15:22.991 --> 15:25.910
Didn't look like that to me.

15:26.035 --> 15:29.122
She's not my type.

15:29.247 --> 15:31.541
No?

15:31.666 --> 15:34.377
No.

15:35.878 --> 15:38.047
- Come here.
- No.

15:38.131 --> 15:39.716
Come here.

15:39.799 --> 15:42.760
I wanna show you something.

15:42.844 --> 15:46.556
- What?
- My inside pocket.

15:57.150 --> 16:00.111
Take out my wallet.

16:06.117 --> 16:08.619
Open it.

16:08.745 --> 16:12.498
Inside there's a picture.

16:12.623 --> 16:16.169
No, not that one.

16:16.294 --> 16:19.130
There's another.

16:21.090 --> 16:24.093
Now, she's my type.

16:26.554 --> 16:29.599
- She'd be anybody's type.
- Don't you think of it, fucker.

16:29.682 --> 16:32.602
- Why not?
- She's mine.

16:32.685 --> 16:35.021
Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.

16:35.104 --> 16:39.567
- No?
- Absolutely not.

16:39.692 --> 16:42.862
Is she your wife?

16:42.945 --> 16:45.782
I guess you could say that.

16:45.907 --> 16:50.620
- You make a nice couple.
- Don't I know it.

16:50.745 --> 16:53.623
So what were you
fuckin' around for then?

16:53.748 --> 16:55.792
You fuckers set me up.

16:55.875 --> 16:57.752
That... That bitch.

16:59.754 --> 17:02.715
She's a friend of mine.

17:06.803 --> 17:09.806
Okay. That nice lady.

17:09.931 --> 17:12.724
She meets me in a bar.

17:14.143 --> 17:15.686
I'm thinkin' to myself:

17:15.770 --> 17:18.897
"What the fuck
am I doin' here anyway?"

17:18.982 --> 17:21.567
- What the fuck were you doin' here?
- I got sent.

17:21.651 --> 17:24.362
- You could've said no.
- Can't once I signed up.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.906
- Why did you sign up?
- It was a job.

17:27.991 --> 17:30.076
Yeah, a job.

17:30.159 --> 17:32.787
So I get sent to
the one place in the world...

17:32.870 --> 17:35.623
where they call you "nigger"
to your face.

17:35.707 --> 17:37.208
Shouldn't take it personally.

17:39.544 --> 17:44.716
"Go back to
your banana tree, nigger."

17:44.841 --> 17:48.344
There's no use tellin' 'em
I come from Tottenham.

17:48.469 --> 17:52.390
- And you like cricket?
- Best game in the world.

17:52.473 --> 17:54.517
Ever see hurling?

17:54.600 --> 17:57.478
That game where a bunch of paddies
whack sticks at each other?

17:57.603 --> 18:00.356
- Best game in the world. The fastest.
- Never.

18:00.481 --> 18:03.985
Well, in Antigua, cricket's
the black man's game.

18:04.110 --> 18:06.988
Kids play it
from the age of two.

18:07.113 --> 18:10.158
My dad had me throwin' googlies
from the age of five.

18:10.283 --> 18:13.328
Then we moved to Tottenham
and it was somethin' different.

18:13.453 --> 18:16.080
- How was it different?
- Toffs' game there.

18:16.205 --> 18:19.834
But not at home.

18:19.917 --> 18:23.338
So, when you come
to shoot me, Paddy...

18:23.421 --> 18:28.051
remember you're gettin' rid
of a shit-hot bowler.

18:29.510 --> 18:33.639
I'll bear it in mind.

18:33.765 --> 18:37.644
And by the way...

18:39.312 --> 18:43.316
it's not "Paddy." It's Fergus.

18:44.942 --> 18:47.987
Nice to meet you, Fergus.

18:48.112 --> 18:51.532
My pleasure, Jody.

18:58.289 --> 19:00.291
Stay. Wait. Wait!

19:02.502 --> 19:04.712
Take it easy now. Just go slow.
Down by that tree.

19:04.796 --> 19:07.715
Tree. Tree.

19:07.799 --> 19:09.676
Right.

19:13.471 --> 19:17.850
- You gotta loosen my hands.
- Can't.

19:17.976 --> 19:21.020
Can't?

19:21.145 --> 19:24.983
Then you're gonna have to take my dick
out for me, aren't you?

19:26.567 --> 19:30.530
Come on, man!
I'm gonna wet my pants.

19:41.165 --> 19:44.836
Take the fucker out, man.
I'm dying.

19:53.052 --> 19:56.681
I gotta lean forwards,
or dribble all over myself.

19:56.764 --> 20:00.101
Would you hold my hands for me?

20:10.194 --> 20:13.531
Now, that is worth waiting for.

20:13.656 --> 20:17.410
- Hurry up, will ya?
- These things take time, Fergus.

20:17.493 --> 20:21.205
It's amazing how
these small details...

20:21.331 --> 20:25.209
take on such importance,
isn't it?

20:25.293 --> 20:27.962
Now put it back in.

20:29.589 --> 20:33.551
- Give us a break.
- I can't do it!

20:33.634 --> 20:36.554
It's only a piece of meat.

20:36.637 --> 20:40.099
For fuck's sake,
it's got no major diseases!

20:47.774 --> 20:49.651
Thank you.

20:51.027 --> 20:53.196
I had a case of the clap
two years ago.

20:53.321 --> 20:56.157
- Crabs in Ulster.
- Shut up, will ya!

20:56.240 --> 20:59.160
But, all in all,
it served me pretty well.

20:59.243 --> 21:02.872
- Get inside, will ya?
- I didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.

21:07.627 --> 21:10.046
Fergus.

21:10.171 --> 21:13.216
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry.

21:13.341 --> 21:17.845
I... I know that
wasn't very easy for you.

21:17.929 --> 21:22.016
The pleasure was all mine.

21:26.270 --> 21:28.690
Oh, no, it was mine.

21:28.815 --> 21:32.193
Believe me, it was my pleasure.

21:35.613 --> 21:38.032
- What the fuck is this?
- Nothin', man.

21:38.116 --> 21:40.743
He just took me out for a pee.

21:40.868 --> 21:43.788
Put the fuckin' hood on him.

21:51.254 --> 21:53.339
- What the fuck is this?
- Nothin'.

21:53.464 --> 21:55.675
He's just got a sense of humor,
that's all.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.678
When you're on duty
you'll keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

21:58.803 --> 22:03.016
- Go on and get some sleep.
- Yeah, get some sleep.

22:20.742 --> 22:23.578
Did he talk?

22:24.746 --> 22:27.707
Didn't make you laugh?

22:28.624 --> 22:30.209
Here, have some breakfast.

22:30.335 --> 22:32.503
Good morning, Fergus.

22:32.628 --> 22:36.049
- So, he knows your name?
- Yeah, I told him.

22:36.174 --> 22:39.260
Are you all there? Come here.

22:39.344 --> 22:42.347
I said come here!

22:42.430 --> 22:45.141
Back in a minute, Jody.

22:51.689 --> 22:54.233
You'll have minimum contact
with that prisoner!

22:54.359 --> 22:55.526
Yeah, okay.

22:55.610 --> 22:56.819
- You know why?
- Why?

22:56.944 --> 23:01.407
Because tomorrow we might
have to shoot him, that's why.

23:12.043 --> 23:16.631
They givin' you
trouble, Fergus?

23:16.714 --> 23:18.675
It happens.

23:18.758 --> 23:21.678
There's two kinds of people:

23:21.761 --> 23:25.682
Those who give
and those who take.

23:27.433 --> 23:30.353
Take off the hood, man.

23:32.313 --> 23:35.233
It's okay.

23:36.484 --> 23:39.362
I understand.

23:39.487 --> 23:42.991
Don't mind if
I prattle on, do you?

23:45.118 --> 23:50.790
I take it by your silence
that you don't.

23:50.915 --> 23:53.793
Two types, Fergus:

23:53.918 --> 23:57.714
The scorpion and the frog.

23:57.797 --> 24:00.133
Ever heard of 'em?

24:02.260 --> 24:07.015
A scorpion wants to cross the river,
but he can't swim.

24:07.140 --> 24:11.686
Goes to a frog who can
and asks for a ride.

24:11.811 --> 24:15.189
Frog says,
"If I give you a ride on my back...

24:15.315 --> 24:17.692
you'll go and sting me."

24:17.817 --> 24:21.279
Scorpion replies, "It would not be
in my interest to sting you..."

24:21.362 --> 24:25.033
since, as I'll be on your back,
we both would drown."

24:25.158 --> 24:28.703
Frog thinks about this logic for a while
and accepts the deal.

24:28.828 --> 24:33.416
Takes the scorpion on his back,
braves the waters...

24:33.541 --> 24:38.588
halfway over feels a burning spear
in his side...

24:38.713 --> 24:43.051
and realizes the scorpion
has stung him after all.

24:43.134 --> 24:47.347
And as they both
sink beneath the waves...

24:47.472 --> 24:50.350
the frog cries out...

24:50.475 --> 24:53.895
"Why'd you sting me
Mr. Scorpion?

24:54.020 --> 24:58.733
For now we both will drown."

24:58.858 --> 25:02.779
Scorpion replies...

25:02.904 --> 25:08.117
"I can't help it.
It's in my nature."

25:10.787 --> 25:13.706
So what's that
supposed to mean?

25:13.831 --> 25:16.959
Means what it says.

25:17.043 --> 25:22.340
A scorpion does
what is in its nature.

25:26.969 --> 25:29.514
Take off the hood, man.

25:29.639 --> 25:34.560
- Why?
- 'Cause you're kind...

25:34.686 --> 25:38.564
and it's in your nature.

25:54.998 --> 25:58.376
See? I was right about you.

25:58.459 --> 26:01.379
Don't be so sure.

26:01.504 --> 26:03.715
Jody's always right.

26:06.050 --> 26:11.180
Where would you most
like to be now, man?

26:11.264 --> 26:15.727
- Doesn't matter where.
- Come on, man.

26:15.852 --> 26:20.440
If this shit was all over.

26:23.234 --> 26:26.279
Havin' a pint in the Rock.

26:26.362 --> 26:29.282
You lack imagination, Fergus.

26:29.365 --> 26:33.244
Think of something more...
alluring.

26:33.369 --> 26:35.955
Like what?

26:36.080 --> 26:39.667
Like... havin' a pint
in the Metro.

26:43.963 --> 26:47.216
- Havin' two pints in the Rock.
- Havin' a pint in the Metro...

26:47.342 --> 26:49.886
and Dil's havin' a margarita.

26:49.969 --> 26:52.597
- Who's Dil?
- Special friend.

26:52.722 --> 26:54.849
Oh, yeah.

26:54.974 --> 27:00.146
- We got simple tastes, you and me.
- Yup, the best.

27:01.356 --> 27:04.567
But you guys never
get a break, do you?

27:04.692 --> 27:07.487
- Do you?
- Oh, yeah.

27:07.570 --> 27:11.282
We do a tour of duty
and we're finished.

27:11.407 --> 27:14.285
But you guys are never finished,
are you?

27:14.410 --> 27:18.331
We don't look on it that way.

27:18.456 --> 27:20.750
Often wonder how you do it.

27:20.875 --> 27:23.461
It depends what you believe in.

27:23.586 --> 27:26.339
- What do you believe in?
- That you guys shouldn't be here.

27:26.464 --> 27:28.299
- That simple?
- Yeah.

27:32.595 --> 27:35.723
- Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
- He's hot!

27:35.848 --> 27:38.351
Doesn't matter if he's hot.
Just cover the fucker up.

27:38.476 --> 27:40.561
You got no feelings, woman!

27:40.687 --> 27:43.564
You shut your face!

27:45.733 --> 27:48.945
- You're headed for trouble, Fergus.
- Okay, okay.

27:49.070 --> 27:52.740
He's a good soldier...

27:52.824 --> 27:56.411
I said shut the fuck up.

27:57.996 --> 28:01.290
- He believes in the future.
- Is that right?

28:28.484 --> 28:31.446
Is it bad?

28:31.571 --> 28:34.490
Not bad.

28:37.493 --> 28:39.620
Women are trouble.

28:39.704 --> 28:43.041
- Do you know that, Fergus?
- I didn't.

28:44.500 --> 28:47.337
Some kinds of women are.

28:47.462 --> 28:50.673
She can't help it.

28:53.551 --> 28:59.015
Dil, she was no trouble,
no trouble at all.

29:00.058 --> 29:04.437
- You liked her?
- Present tense, please, please.

29:05.980 --> 29:08.608
Love her...

29:08.691 --> 29:11.694
wherever she is.

29:13.696 --> 29:18.576
I'm thinkin' of her now.
Would you think of her too?

29:19.827 --> 29:22.622
I don't know her.

29:22.747 --> 29:24.791
I want you
to do something for me.

29:24.916 --> 29:26.709
What?

29:26.793 --> 29:30.713
- If they kill me...
- Don't think that way.

29:31.839 --> 29:33.299
But they will...

29:33.424 --> 29:36.302
as sure as night follows day.

29:36.427 --> 29:38.888
They have to.

29:38.972 --> 29:42.392
I want you to find her out.

29:42.475 --> 29:45.937
Tell her I was thinkin' of her.

29:46.062 --> 29:50.817
- See if she's all right.
- I don't know her.

29:50.942 --> 29:54.195
Take her picture. It's...

29:54.320 --> 29:57.323
Come here.
It's in my inside pocket.

30:03.287 --> 30:06.082
Take the whole lot.
I won't need it.

30:06.165 --> 30:10.461
I told you not
to talk that way.

30:10.586 --> 30:15.258
Go to Millies Hair Salon
in Spittalfields.

30:16.467 --> 30:19.345
Take her to the Metro
for a margarita.

30:19.470 --> 30:22.181
You don't have
to tell her who you are.

30:22.307 --> 30:23.474
You just tell her
Jody was thinkin' of her...

30:23.599 --> 30:24.809
Stop it.

30:42.285 --> 30:43.786
Volunteer?

30:45.913 --> 30:49.584
We need you inside.

31:05.808 --> 31:08.436
We've heard word.

31:08.561 --> 31:12.023
They've used every trick in the book
and he's beginnin' to talk.

31:14.567 --> 31:16.444
You're gonna have
to do it in the mornin'.

31:21.491 --> 31:22.950
You okay about that?

31:24.160 --> 31:25.912
- I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
- Good.

31:25.995 --> 31:29.040
Beginnin' to have me doubts
about you the past few days.

31:29.165 --> 31:31.042
- Not the only one.
- Shut up, Jude.

31:33.127 --> 31:35.129
Better get some sleep
tonight, Fergus.

31:36.297 --> 31:40.051
- Peter.
- What?

31:40.176 --> 31:42.845
Request permission to guard
the prisoner tonight.

31:42.929 --> 31:45.598
- You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
- Shut the fuck up, Jude.

31:45.723 --> 31:51.562
- What do you want to do that for?
- It would make me feel better about it.

31:51.646 --> 31:55.191
- Sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

31:56.651 --> 32:01.114
Okay. You're
a good man, Fergus.

32:11.290 --> 32:15.378
- Don't.
- I... I'm sorry.

32:20.675 --> 32:23.594
Help me.

32:25.596 --> 32:30.101
- How can I?
- I don't know.

32:30.184 --> 32:34.063
I don't know.

32:35.648 --> 32:37.275
Just help me.

32:42.488 --> 32:44.490
Give me a cigarette.

33:01.883 --> 33:04.802
I don't even...
I don't even smoke.

33:06.929 --> 33:11.726
Thought it was
the right thing to do.

33:24.072 --> 33:28.576
- Go to sleep now.
- I don't want to sleep.

33:28.660 --> 33:30.703
Tell me something.

33:30.787 --> 33:34.999
- What?
- A story.

33:35.124 --> 33:38.211
- Like the one about the frog?
- And the scorpion?

33:38.336 --> 33:40.963
No. No.

33:42.507 --> 33:44.717
Tell me anything.

33:44.842 --> 33:48.721
- "When I was a child..."
- Yeah?

33:51.224 --> 33:55.728
"I thought as a child."

33:55.853 --> 33:58.731
But when I became a man...

33:58.856 --> 34:02.568
"I put away childish things."

34:04.112 --> 34:07.115
What does that mean?

34:07.198 --> 34:09.993
Nothing.

34:10.118 --> 34:12.495
Nothing?

34:12.620 --> 34:16.123
Tell me something.

34:16.248 --> 34:19.168
Anything.

34:24.090 --> 34:28.969
Not a lot of use,
are you, Fergus?

34:31.723 --> 34:33.850
Me?

34:35.685 --> 34:38.730
No.

34:38.813 --> 34:41.357
I'm not good for much.

35:10.803 --> 35:13.264
Come on, stand up.

35:15.975 --> 35:17.810
Turn to your right.

35:18.936 --> 35:22.565
Okay, step up. One step.

35:23.858 --> 35:25.943
Okay, turn to your right.

35:26.027 --> 35:28.946
Go forward. Step up.

35:36.162 --> 35:38.206
Now to the left.

35:42.418 --> 35:44.128
I wish to say on behalf of
the Irish Republican Army...

35:44.253 --> 35:45.588
Leave him be!

36:00.478 --> 36:03.398
Take the hood off, Fergus.

36:03.523 --> 36:05.358
No.

36:06.442 --> 36:09.737
I want to see you a bit, please.
Please.

36:09.821 --> 36:13.741
Don't make me die
like an animal.

36:25.795 --> 36:29.048
I'm glad you're doin' it.

36:29.173 --> 36:31.467
Do you know that, Fergus?

36:31.551 --> 36:35.805
- Why?
- 'Cause you're my friend.

36:35.888 --> 36:40.810
- And I want you to go to the Metro.
- Stop that talk now!

36:42.437 --> 36:45.064
Hurling's a fast game,
isn't it, Fergus?

36:45.148 --> 36:46.357
The fastest.

36:46.441 --> 36:48.735
- Faster than cricket?
- Cricket's in the ha'penny place.

36:48.860 --> 36:52.363
So if I ran, there's no way
I could beat you, is there?

36:52.447 --> 36:55.825
- You won't run!
- But if I did...

36:55.950 --> 36:58.244
you wouldn't shoot
a brother in the back.

36:58.328 --> 36:59.704
Jody!

37:01.456 --> 37:04.000
- You stupid bastard!
- What'd you say, faster?

37:04.125 --> 37:07.712
- I said you bastard! Stop!
- Gotta catch me first.

37:07.837 --> 37:10.006
Used to run the mile, you know,

37:10.089 --> 37:11.716
four times
around the cricket pitch.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.320
- What was that game called?
- Hurling!

37:14.344 --> 37:16.512
- What? What?
- Hurling!

37:19.349 --> 37:21.601
Told you I was fast?

37:28.983 --> 37:30.360
Don't do it.

37:36.658 --> 37:38.493
Jody!

37:44.624 --> 37:46.751
All line up! Follow me!

37:59.681 --> 38:01.432
Over here now!

38:01.557 --> 38:04.060
Jude! Run!

38:37.802 --> 38:40.013
Fergus.

38:40.138 --> 38:42.098
You're back on the bike, Tommy?

38:44.767 --> 38:47.061
- How're ya keepin'?
- All right.

38:47.186 --> 38:52.066
- And notice I've asked you nothin'.
- That's wise, Tommy.

38:52.191 --> 38:56.195
All right then.
I like bein' wise.

38:58.740 --> 39:02.327
So what do you need, Fergus?

39:02.452 --> 39:05.788
- Need to go across the water.
- Do ya now?

39:05.872 --> 39:08.374
Need to lose myself
for a while.

39:08.499 --> 39:11.210
Aye.

39:11.336 --> 39:15.673
There's a man I know
ships cattle to London.

40:46.472 --> 40:48.891
We're closing.

40:50.143 --> 40:52.103
You deaf?

40:52.186 --> 40:55.356
- I'll see you tomorrow, Dil.
- 'Night.

40:55.481 --> 40:58.943
- Want something in particular?
- Just a bit of a trim.

40:59.027 --> 41:01.195
Come on.

41:18.463 --> 41:21.674
- Someone recommended you?
- In a way.

41:21.799 --> 41:26.429
- Who?
- A guy I work with.

41:26.512 --> 41:30.266
- What's his name?
- Does the water not get to your nails?

41:30.350 --> 41:33.561
- What's it to you?
- Nothing.

41:36.147 --> 41:38.191
- You American?
- No.

41:38.316 --> 41:41.152
- You're not English.
- No.

41:41.235 --> 41:44.572
- Scottish?
- How'd you guess?

41:44.656 --> 41:48.910
- The accent, I suppose.
- What's it like?

41:50.203 --> 41:52.372
Like treacle.

41:54.165 --> 41:57.543
Nice laugh.

42:05.468 --> 42:08.972
There. That should
make her happy.

42:10.181 --> 42:13.768
- Who's "she"?
- Don't know. Who is "she"?

42:49.053 --> 42:52.849
- Hi, Dil.
- Hi ya, hon.

42:52.932 --> 42:55.476
- All right?
- I suppose.

42:59.397 --> 43:02.692
- Yes? What'll it be?
- Bottle of Guinness.

43:02.817 --> 43:05.737
Bottle of Guinness.

43:07.739 --> 43:09.991
- See that, Col?
- See what, Dil?

43:10.116 --> 43:12.702
- He gave me a look.
- Did he?

43:12.827 --> 43:15.204
- I just cut his hair, you know.
- Yeah?

43:15.330 --> 43:19.542
- So what do you think?
- Nice.

43:22.587 --> 43:24.839
There. He did it again.

43:24.922 --> 43:28.509
- I saw that one. That was a look.
- What would you call that?

43:30.136 --> 43:32.138
Ask him to ask me
what I'm drinking.

43:32.263 --> 43:34.349
She wants to know do you want
to know what she's drinking.

43:34.474 --> 43:36.434
A margarita.

43:42.732 --> 43:45.109
Now he can look.

43:49.072 --> 43:52.325
Ask him does he
like his hair, Col.

43:52.408 --> 43:55.244
She wants to know, sir,
do you like your hair.

43:55.370 --> 43:58.998
- Tell her I'm very happy with it.
- He's Scottish, Col.

43:59.123 --> 44:02.001
- Scottish?
- Yeah.

44:02.126 --> 44:05.088
- What he say?
- He agreed that he was.

44:05.213 --> 44:08.549
And what do you think
his name might be?

44:08.633 --> 44:11.094
I have no thoughts
on the subject.

44:11.177 --> 44:13.388
- Jimmy.
- Jimmy?

44:13.471 --> 44:15.807
Jimmy. That's what he said.

44:15.890 --> 44:18.267
Hi ya, Jimmy.

44:18.351 --> 44:20.436
Hi, Dil.

44:24.232 --> 44:26.734
- Sing us a song, Dil.
- Fuck off, Dave.

44:26.859 --> 44:29.445
Come on, babe.
You know what I like.

44:30.530 --> 44:31.656
Easy!

44:42.083 --> 44:43.793
- Shit.
- Where d'you think you're goin'?

44:43.918 --> 44:46.879
Piss off, Dave.
Get off my case!

44:46.963 --> 44:48.881
Fuckin' cow!

45:02.228 --> 45:05.565
- Go on, get in there!
- Stop pushing.

45:05.690 --> 45:07.942
This is the last time.

45:54.947 --> 45:57.492
- One run!
- Come on!

46:02.205 --> 46:04.957
So, Pat's a cricket fan, is he?

46:05.083 --> 46:07.919
It's not Pat. It's Jim.

46:08.002 --> 46:11.255
I don't actually give a fuck
whether it's Jim, Pat or Mick...

46:11.381 --> 46:14.050
as long as you remember
you're not at Lords, all right?

46:23.393 --> 46:24.811
Here, love.

46:24.936 --> 46:29.148
- So, I see you're a regular, sir.
- Is that good or bad?

46:29.899 --> 46:34.028
Well, you get to say, "The usual, Col,"
things like that.

46:38.491 --> 46:43.287
- Here. Let's call this the usual.
- Thanks.

46:43.413 --> 46:46.249
- No, no. It's on me.
- Thanks very much.

46:49.794 --> 46:51.295
You can take it out
if you want.

46:54.215 --> 46:57.135
Came to see her, didn't you?

46:57.218 --> 46:58.886
Listen, there's something
I should tell you. She's...

46:58.970 --> 47:02.682
- She's what?
- She's on.

47:10.690 --> 47:14.736
I know all there is to know

47:14.861 --> 47:17.989
About the crying game

47:22.452 --> 47:25.663
I've had my share

47:25.788 --> 47:28.916
Of the crying game

47:32.879 --> 47:37.967
- First there are kisses
- Kisses

47:38.051 --> 47:41.721
Then there are sighs

47:41.846 --> 47:46.851
And then before
you know where you are

47:46.934 --> 47:50.938
You're saying good-bye

47:52.357 --> 47:56.486
One day soon
I'm gonna tell the moon

47:56.611 --> 48:00.031
About the crying game

48:03.326 --> 48:07.372
And if he knows

48:07.497 --> 48:10.833
Maybe he'll explain

48:14.671 --> 48:18.341
- Why there are heartaches
- Heartaches

48:19.842 --> 48:23.554
Why there are tears

48:23.680 --> 48:25.974
And what to do

48:26.099 --> 48:28.559
To stop feelin' blue

48:28.643 --> 48:31.729
When love disappears

48:34.190 --> 48:38.611
Don't want no more

48:38.695 --> 48:42.865
Of the crying game

48:44.659 --> 48:49.163
Don't want no more

48:49.247 --> 48:53.167
Of the crying game

48:57.714 --> 49:00.883
Don't know what you said
to make me love you so

49:00.967 --> 49:04.304
I only know I never
wanna let you go

49:04.429 --> 49:06.764
- He's still looking, Col.
- Persistent.

49:06.889 --> 49:09.934
- Good thing in a man.
- An excellent quality.

49:10.018 --> 49:12.770
- Maybe he wants something.
- I expect he does.

49:12.854 --> 49:16.691
- Ask him.
- Ask him yourself.

49:16.816 --> 49:19.777
So tell me.

49:19.861 --> 49:22.488
- Everybody wants something.
- Not me.

49:22.572 --> 49:24.574
Not you? How quaint.

49:24.657 --> 49:28.202
How old-fashioned and quaint,
isn't it, Col?

49:28.286 --> 49:30.747
- You old-fashioned?
- Must be.

49:30.830 --> 49:33.082
- Got the money, Dil?
- Fuck off, Dave.

49:33.207 --> 49:35.877
- You fuckin' promised.
- Did I?

49:35.960 --> 49:39.297
You fucking did!
Well, didn't you?

49:39.422 --> 49:40.965
Well, come on!

49:44.177 --> 49:46.638
It takes all types.

49:47.930 --> 49:50.933
- So who's he?
- He's what she should run a mile from.

49:52.185 --> 49:54.145
Then why doesn't she?

49:54.228 --> 49:56.439
Who knows the secrets
of the human heart?

49:58.232 --> 50:01.569
As long as we're together
honey, I don't care

50:01.653 --> 50:04.989
'Cause you started somethin'
Oh, can't you see

50:05.073 --> 50:08.785
And ever since we met
you've had a hold on me

50:09.827 --> 50:11.120
All right, good night.

50:11.245 --> 50:12.622
You can't come in here, love.

50:20.922 --> 50:22.924
- Don't be like that.
- You heard me.

50:23.049 --> 50:25.510
We're fuckin' grand
all of a sudden?

50:25.635 --> 50:29.347
- Talk to me, you stupid bitch!
- Piss off, Dave.

50:29.430 --> 50:30.932
Hi.

50:33.184 --> 50:35.353
Hi. You forgot your bag.

50:35.478 --> 50:37.772
- Thank you. Jimmy.
- Who the fuck's he?

50:37.897 --> 50:39.857
- It's him, isn't it?
- Maybe.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.074
- See, they get the wrong idea.
- Cunt.

50:48.157 --> 50:50.785
- What was that?
- They all get the wrong idea.

50:50.910 --> 50:53.663
- Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt!
- Charming.

50:53.788 --> 50:55.832
- What'll I do?
- Break his neck.

50:56.916 --> 50:58.376
No, don't.

50:58.459 --> 51:01.337
He's gonna take his foot off
slowly, David...

51:01.421 --> 51:05.008
and you're to go home
like a good boy, you hear?

51:06.092 --> 51:07.302
Cunt.

51:09.554 --> 51:11.139
Come on, honey.

51:16.811 --> 51:21.232
- You all right?
- Yes, thank you.

51:21.316 --> 51:23.735
What was all that about?

51:23.818 --> 51:26.738
He wants me to perform for him.

51:26.821 --> 51:30.658
- Perform?
- You know.

51:30.742 --> 51:33.661
- You on the game?
- God, no.

51:33.745 --> 51:36.664
I'm a hairdresser.

51:36.748 --> 51:39.709
He's gettin' up.

51:40.793 --> 51:44.297
Can't leave me then, can you?

51:59.270 --> 52:02.148
- You want me to ask you in, right?
- No. Didn't say that.

52:02.273 --> 52:06.319
But I'm not cheap, you know that?
Loud, but never cheap.

52:10.531 --> 52:12.700
Fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt!

52:14.077 --> 52:18.206
If you kiss me,
it would really get his goat.

52:32.011 --> 52:34.973
Now, if you ask me
to meet you tomorrow...

52:35.098 --> 52:38.977
it would really
drive him insane.

52:39.060 --> 52:43.272
- Where?
- Half-five at Millies.

52:58.121 --> 52:59.747
Give me that look again.

52:59.831 --> 53:03.751
- What look?
- The one you gave me in the Metro.

53:08.172 --> 53:11.092
Darling, you shouldn't have.

53:13.553 --> 53:15.930
- What's that about?
- They're jealous.

53:16.014 --> 53:20.018
- Why?
- I wonder.

53:33.656 --> 53:37.076
Now's the time you
meant to do something, isn't it?

53:37.160 --> 53:40.621
- Like what?
- Make a pass or something.

53:40.705 --> 53:44.625
- Isn't that the way it goes?
- Must be.

53:48.796 --> 53:52.508
- Have you got a special friend, Jimmy?
- How special?

53:52.634 --> 53:56.179
- Do you want one?
- Christ!

53:57.472 --> 53:58.848
Jesus.

54:00.767 --> 54:04.896
- That Dave?
- The things a girl has to put up with.

54:07.023 --> 54:10.443
I'm frightened, Jimmy.
That's not like him.

54:14.864 --> 54:16.824
Piss off, Dave!

54:19.535 --> 54:21.663
Tough guy?

54:21.746 --> 54:24.666
Are you gonna be
all right on your own?

54:24.749 --> 54:28.044
But I'm not on my own, am I?

54:38.096 --> 54:41.265
It won't hurt you to come in.

54:44.060 --> 54:46.604
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, please.

54:46.688 --> 54:50.566
- What'll it be?
- Whiskey.

54:54.529 --> 54:57.865
Yeah! Hey!

54:57.949 --> 55:01.202
- Come on, Dil!
- Somebody out there.

55:01.327 --> 55:03.538
Jesus fucking Christ.

55:04.706 --> 55:06.582
Hey, Dil!

55:07.917 --> 55:11.838
- Hey, Stirling fucking Moss!
- It's Dave!

55:11.921 --> 55:15.550
- Come on, Dil, talk to me!
- Sure, Dave.

55:15.633 --> 55:18.261
Come on! Hey, Dil...

55:18.386 --> 55:21.347
- Hey, they're my clothes!
- Take your clothes...

55:21.472 --> 55:25.310
- Don't throw my clothes out the window!
- And fuck off...

55:25.393 --> 55:28.354
- back to Essex!
- Fuckin' mad!

55:28.438 --> 55:31.691
Don't chuck my clothes out!

55:34.569 --> 55:37.989
Take your fucking goldfish too!

55:38.072 --> 55:41.617
My fuckin' fish!

55:45.747 --> 55:46.998
Murderer!

55:51.461 --> 55:53.379
Sorry.

55:55.173 --> 55:57.592
How does he drive
with his neck in a brace?

55:57.675 --> 55:59.594
Must be in love to manage that.

55:59.677 --> 56:03.056
Doesn't know the meaning
of the word.

56:03.181 --> 56:06.851
- Did he live here with you?
- He tried to.

56:08.603 --> 56:10.521
Sit down, will you?

56:12.106 --> 56:14.484
What about him?

56:14.609 --> 56:16.694
He was different.

56:18.279 --> 56:20.198
How different?

56:20.281 --> 56:23.785
As different
as it's possible to be.

56:23.910 --> 56:26.537
Tell me about him.

56:26.663 --> 56:28.539
No.

56:31.626 --> 56:34.045
Shouldn't I go?

56:34.170 --> 56:36.130
Yes.

56:54.649 --> 56:56.567
No.

56:59.153 --> 57:02.657
Did you do that to him?

57:02.782 --> 57:06.327
- You want to know how I kissed him?
- Yes.

57:07.412 --> 57:10.498
- Are you jealous?
- Maybe.

57:11.958 --> 57:13.876
That's good.

58:09.307 --> 58:11.893
What would he think?

58:12.018 --> 58:15.813
He can't think. He's dead.

58:20.443 --> 58:24.530
In Ireland. He was a soldier.
Went there like a fool.

58:24.614 --> 58:28.076
- Do you miss him?
- What do you think?

58:29.869 --> 58:35.083
- I think you do.
- You say that like a gentleman.

58:35.166 --> 58:38.169
- Do I?
- Like you're concerned.

58:47.261 --> 58:50.264
You can't stay. You know that.

58:50.348 --> 58:53.017
Didn't think I could.

58:53.101 --> 58:55.019
Real gentleman.

58:59.774 --> 59:03.069
- Shouldn't you be in mourning?
- I am.

59:23.965 --> 59:31.965
There'll be bluebirds over

59:32.098 --> 59:34.851
The white cliffs of Dover...

59:34.934 --> 59:37.186
- Look, Dil, I'm sorry.
- Fuck off, Dave.

59:37.270 --> 59:39.272
No, I won't fucking fuck off.

59:39.355 --> 59:42.442
- I said I'm sorry, didn't I?
- Yeah. I heard.

59:42.525 --> 59:44.444
You hear, Jimmy?

59:46.487 --> 59:49.782
I was only gonna ask her
for a dance.

59:49.866 --> 59:51.784
Shall we?

59:53.870 --> 01:00:00.710
There'll be love and laughter

01:00:01.794 --> 01:00:03.671
Did he come here too?

01:00:03.755 --> 01:00:07.467
- Is this an obsession of yours?
- Maybe.

01:00:07.592 --> 01:00:09.594
He did, sometimes.

01:00:09.719 --> 01:00:12.055
Did he dance with you?

01:00:12.138 --> 01:00:15.975
What do you want with me,
Jimmy?

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.020
- I want to look after you.
- What does that mean?

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.982
It's something I heard
someone say once.

01:00:23.107 --> 01:00:26.235
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

01:00:26.361 --> 01:00:28.696
Why?

01:00:30.573 --> 01:00:31.866
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

01:00:31.949 --> 01:00:39.123
The valley will bloom again

01:00:39.248 --> 01:00:46.047
Johnny will go to sleep

01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:52.261
In his room there's room again

01:00:52.387 --> 01:00:58.935
There'll be love and laughter

01:00:59.018 --> 01:01:01.604
You're not havin' me on,
are you?

01:01:01.688 --> 01:01:03.856
'Cause Dil can't stand that.

01:01:05.358 --> 01:01:07.402
No.

01:01:07.527 --> 01:01:10.279
She does get very upset.

01:01:12.615 --> 01:01:16.744
Just you wait

01:01:16.869 --> 01:01:17.369
And

01:01:21.082 --> 01:01:21.582
See

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.642
One for him too.

01:01:43.021 --> 01:01:45.189
Drink.

01:01:45.273 --> 01:01:48.234
- What is this?
- I'm superstitious. Drink.

01:01:51.988 --> 01:01:54.907
Can't leave me now.

01:01:54.991 --> 01:01:57.785
The thing is,
can you go the distance?

01:01:57.910 --> 01:02:01.247
- Depends what it is.
- Depends on nothing.

01:02:04.876 --> 01:02:06.961
In one.

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.057
What you thinkin' of, hon?

01:02:20.475 --> 01:02:23.478
- I'm thinkin' of your man.
- Why?

01:02:23.603 --> 01:02:26.147
I'm wonderin' why
you keep his things.

01:02:26.272 --> 01:02:28.441
I told you.

01:02:28.524 --> 01:02:30.568
I'm superstitious.

01:02:31.903 --> 01:02:35.907
Did he ever tell you
you were beautiful?

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:38.743
All the time.

01:02:38.868 --> 01:02:41.496
Even now.

01:02:41.621 --> 01:02:44.874
- What do you mean?
- He looks after me.

01:02:44.999 --> 01:02:47.418
He's a gentleman too.

01:03:08.356 --> 01:03:10.358
Wait just one minute.

01:03:42.098 --> 01:03:43.891
Would he have minded?

01:04:02.618 --> 01:04:04.537
You did know, didn't you?

01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:09.083
Oh, my God.

01:04:11.711 --> 01:04:13.671
Jesus, I feel sick.

01:04:15.298 --> 01:04:17.925
Don't go, Jimmy!

01:04:20.011 --> 01:04:22.513
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

01:04:33.191 --> 01:04:36.110
What were doing in the bar
if you didn't know?

01:04:38.946 --> 01:04:41.407
Oh, I'm bleeding.

01:04:50.208 --> 01:04:52.210
It's all right, Jimmy.
I can take it.

01:04:52.335 --> 01:04:54.212
Just not on the face.

01:04:57.423 --> 01:04:59.842
See, I'm not a young thing
any longer.

01:05:03.596 --> 01:05:05.765
Funny the way things go.

01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:08.226
Don't you find that, Jimmy?

01:05:08.351 --> 01:05:10.353
Never the way you expect it.

01:05:15.316 --> 01:05:17.610
I'm sorry.

01:05:17.694 --> 01:05:20.989
You mean that?
Don't go! Say something!

01:05:25.702 --> 01:05:27.620
Jesus.

01:05:59.235 --> 01:06:02.864
Now this love may not be
what we're looking for

01:06:02.989 --> 01:06:06.909
This is not what we are
looking for

01:06:08.286 --> 01:06:10.872
I almost ran It was not

01:06:10.955 --> 01:06:14.083
No, no, no
Walkin' out that door

01:06:16.461 --> 01:06:19.756
- Forget the future
- He's back, Col.

01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:22.550
Hi.

01:06:22.634 --> 01:06:24.552
Don't want any of those looks, Col.
They don't mean much.

01:06:24.636 --> 01:06:27.639
- Stop it, Dil!
- No! Tell him to go fuck himself!

01:06:27.764 --> 01:06:29.891
She wants me to tell you
go fuck yourself!

01:06:30.016 --> 01:06:32.016
- I'm sorry.
- Tell him to stop messin' Dil around!

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.895
- Dil!
- Tell him it hurts.

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:37.732
- I've got to talk to her, Col.
- He says he's got to talk to you.

01:06:37.857 --> 01:06:39.233
- Come on, Dil.
- Where?

01:06:39.359 --> 01:06:41.235
Tell him again,
Col, go fuck himself!

01:06:43.404 --> 01:06:45.573
Until tomorrow

01:06:46.949 --> 01:06:50.787
One day soon
I'm gonna tell the moon

01:06:50.912 --> 01:06:55.625
About the crying game

01:06:58.211 --> 01:07:01.756
And if he knows

01:07:01.881 --> 01:07:05.468
Maybe he'll explain

01:07:09.097 --> 01:07:12.266
Why there are heartaches

01:07:14.227 --> 01:07:18.064
Why there are tears

01:07:26.906 --> 01:07:29.242
- Come here, darlin'!
- Hey! Hey!

01:07:42.046 --> 01:07:44.048
Off you go.

01:07:46.718 --> 01:07:49.512
How much did that frame cost,
Mr. Franknum?

01:07:49.595 --> 01:07:51.514
200 quid, Mr. Deveroux.

01:07:51.597 --> 01:07:55.727
Well, your bloody Pat
has just cost me 200 quid.

01:07:55.852 --> 01:07:57.061
Sorry.

01:07:57.145 --> 01:07:59.522
Sorry isn't gonna bring
the bloody thing back, is it?

01:07:59.605 --> 01:08:01.899
- Not in my experience.
- No.

01:08:05.236 --> 01:08:07.989
- Off his wages.
- Do you mean that?

01:08:08.114 --> 01:08:10.450
He wants to know whether
I mean it, Mr. Franknum.

01:08:10.533 --> 01:08:12.035
I'm sure you do.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.037
Bloody right I do.

01:08:15.371 --> 01:08:17.915
Well, is that Pat's tart?

01:08:18.041 --> 01:08:21.461
- Does Pat have a tart?
- She's not a tart.

01:08:21.586 --> 01:08:25.506
- No, of course not. She's a lady.
- No, she's not that either.

01:08:38.394 --> 01:08:42.148
Darlin'. Never let the sun
go down on an argument...

01:08:42.273 --> 01:08:45.984
- as Jody used to say.
- What are you doing here?

01:08:46.109 --> 01:08:48.112
Got your note.

01:08:48.196 --> 01:08:50.437
- So let's kiss and make up, honey.
- Don't call me that.

01:08:50.531 --> 01:08:52.200
- Sorry, darling.
- Stop it, Dil.

01:08:52.325 --> 01:08:54.327
Apologies, my sweet.

01:08:57.537 --> 01:09:00.707
That's more like it, dear.
Have a cuppa.

01:09:07.423 --> 01:09:09.801
You're somethin' else, Dil.
You know that?

01:09:09.926 --> 01:09:12.345
Never said a truer word.

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:14.889
I was always best
lookin' after someone.

01:09:14.973 --> 01:09:18.309
- Must be something in the genes.
- Must be.

01:09:18.434 --> 01:09:20.603
And the fact that
you didn't know...

01:09:20.687 --> 01:09:22.604
is basically the fault
of yours truly.

01:09:22.689 --> 01:09:26.901
And even when you were throwin' up,
I could tell you cared.

01:09:27.026 --> 01:09:31.197
- You could?
- Do you care, Jimmy?

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:34.158
Yeah. Sure I do.

01:09:34.283 --> 01:09:37.078
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

01:09:37.161 --> 01:09:39.037
I care, Dil.

01:09:43.334 --> 01:09:44.669
Are you crying?

01:09:52.051 --> 01:09:54.220
I'm tired and emotional.

01:09:55.763 --> 01:09:59.350
- Do it on your own time, Pat.
- What?

01:09:59.475 --> 01:10:01.519
Whatever it is
she does for you.

01:10:01.602 --> 01:10:03.563
If I was her,
I'd consider that an insult.

01:10:03.688 --> 01:10:08.401
Consider it how you like.
Just get the bloody tart out of here!

01:10:10.445 --> 01:10:13.740
Didja ever pick your teeth up
with broken fingers?

01:10:15.533 --> 01:10:18.786
- What's that supposed to mean?
- A simple question.

01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:27.128
- Come on, dear.
- He didn't answer, honey.

01:10:29.756 --> 01:10:32.967
Sorry about that, Mr. Deveroux.

01:10:33.051 --> 01:10:35.928
- My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
- Shut up.

01:10:36.054 --> 01:10:38.890
- Made me feel all funny inside.
- I said stop it.

01:10:39.015 --> 01:10:41.726
Ask to meet me again, Jimmy.

01:10:41.851 --> 01:10:45.897
- Do you think that's wise?
- Nothing's wise.

01:10:46.022 --> 01:10:50.401
- I didn't mean to hit you.
- I know that.

01:10:50.485 --> 01:10:54.155
- I kinda liked you as a girl.
- That's a start.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.325
- So, I'm sorry.
- So, make it up to me, then.

01:10:57.450 --> 01:10:59.994
- How?
- Ask to meet me again.

01:11:02.372 --> 01:11:05.959
- Will you meet me again?
- When?

01:11:06.084 --> 01:11:08.586
Whenever.

01:11:08.711 --> 01:11:10.546
Tonight.

01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:26.354
- Good night.
- See ya later.

01:11:28.272 --> 01:11:30.483
- Do they know?
- Know what, honey?

01:11:30.608 --> 01:11:32.110
Know what I didn't know...

01:11:32.235 --> 01:11:34.195
- And don't call me that.
- Can't help it.

01:11:34.278 --> 01:11:37.323
- A girl has her feelings.
- Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.

01:11:37.407 --> 01:11:40.034
- Details, baby, details.
- So they do know.

01:11:41.452 --> 01:11:44.122
- All right, they do.
- Don't.

01:11:45.999 --> 01:11:48.626
- I shoulda known, shouldn't I?
- Probably.

01:11:48.751 --> 01:11:52.255
- Kinda wish I didn't.
- You can always pretend.

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.340
That's true.

01:11:56.009 --> 01:11:57.927
Your soldier knew, didn't he?

01:11:58.011 --> 01:12:00.805
Absolutely.

01:12:00.888 --> 01:12:03.641
Won't be quite the same,
though, will it?

01:12:03.766 --> 01:12:05.476
Are you pretendin' yet?

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.478
I'm workin' on it.

01:12:10.273 --> 01:12:12.317
There's Dave.

01:12:12.442 --> 01:12:15.236
- He knew too.
- Stop it, Jimmy.

01:12:15.361 --> 01:12:18.573
Am I becoming repetitious?

01:12:18.656 --> 01:12:20.575
- A little.
- Sorry.

01:12:22.285 --> 01:12:25.580
- No, don't ask me in.
- Please, Jimmy.

01:12:25.663 --> 01:12:29.959
No. Can't pretend that much.

01:12:30.084 --> 01:12:32.754
- I miss you, Jimmy.
- Yeah?

01:12:32.879 --> 01:12:35.798
- Shoulda stayed a girl.
- Don't be cruel.

01:12:38.635 --> 01:12:41.429
Okay.

01:12:41.512 --> 01:12:43.640
Be a good girl. Go inside.

01:12:45.266 --> 01:12:47.352
Only if you kiss me.

01:12:58.905 --> 01:13:02.283
- Now are you happy?
- Delirious.

01:13:14.837 --> 01:13:16.756
Hello, stranger.

01:13:18.508 --> 01:13:20.385
You vanished.

01:13:22.303 --> 01:13:24.722
What was it, Fergus?
Did you blow the gaff on us...

01:13:24.806 --> 01:13:27.225
or did you just fuck up?

01:13:28.393 --> 01:13:30.895
Leave me alone, Jude.

01:13:30.979 --> 01:13:33.564
No. That's the last thing
I'll do.

01:13:43.032 --> 01:13:46.244
- You never asked what happened.
- I heard.

01:13:46.369 --> 01:13:49.664
- Eddie and Tinker died.
- I know.

01:13:49.747 --> 01:13:52.208
Maguire and me got out
by the skin of our teeth...

01:13:52.292 --> 01:13:53.751
No thanks to you.

01:13:56.504 --> 01:13:59.173
What do you think of my hair?

01:13:59.257 --> 01:14:01.884
- Suits you.
- Aye.

01:14:01.968 --> 01:14:05.596
I was sick of bein' a blonde.

01:14:05.722 --> 01:14:09.225
I needed a tougher look,
if you know what I mean.

01:14:20.111 --> 01:14:22.071
Fuck me, Fergus.

01:14:25.158 --> 01:14:27.702
Am I to take it that's a no?

01:14:30.622 --> 01:14:33.916
We had a court-martial
in your absence.

01:14:34.042 --> 01:14:36.127
They wanted to put
a bullet through your head.

01:14:36.252 --> 01:14:38.338
I pleaded for clemency.

01:14:38.421 --> 01:14:42.592
Said we should find out
what happened first.

01:14:42.675 --> 01:14:44.594
So what did happen?

01:14:45.803 --> 01:14:47.680
He ran.

01:14:47.805 --> 01:14:50.642
I couldn't shoot him
in the back.

01:14:50.725 --> 01:14:53.603
Tried to catch him.

01:14:53.686 --> 01:14:57.815
He made it to the road
and got hit by a Saracen.

01:14:57.899 --> 01:15:02.153
- So you did fuck up.
- Yes.

01:15:02.236 --> 01:15:05.573
But you know what
the thing is, Fergus?

01:15:05.657 --> 01:15:07.700
No. What is the thing?

01:15:07.825 --> 01:15:11.412
You vanished quite effectively.

01:15:11.496 --> 01:15:13.623
Became Mister Nobody.

01:15:13.748 --> 01:15:16.918
You've no idea
how useful that could be.

01:15:17.001 --> 01:15:20.254
- What do you mean?
- We've got some plans here...

01:15:20.338 --> 01:15:23.841
and we'll need a Mister Nobody
to execute them.

01:15:23.967 --> 01:15:26.469
No way, Jude. I'm out.

01:15:26.594 --> 01:15:29.555
You're never out, Fergus.

01:15:31.182 --> 01:15:34.477
Maybe you don't care
about yourself, but...

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.771
Consider the girl, Fergus.

01:15:39.190 --> 01:15:40.900
The wee black chick.

01:15:41.025 --> 01:15:43.695
- Leave her out of this!
- Jesus, Fergus!

01:15:43.778 --> 01:15:45.488
You're a walkin' cliche.

01:15:45.613 --> 01:15:48.992
You know we won't
leave her out of it.

01:15:49.117 --> 01:15:52.787
But I'm glad to see you care.

01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:55.456
And, I must admit...

01:15:55.581 --> 01:15:58.293
- I'm curious.
- What the fuck do you know, Jude?

01:15:58.376 --> 01:16:00.503
You fuckin' tell me, boy!

01:16:02.297 --> 01:16:05.925
She's nobody. She likes me.

01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:09.345
So I suppose a fuck
is out of the question.

01:16:10.972 --> 01:16:14.183
You keep your head down,
Fergus.

01:16:14.267 --> 01:16:16.477
No sudden moves.

01:16:16.602 --> 01:16:19.564
And not a whisper to her.

01:16:19.689 --> 01:16:21.607
You'll be hearin' from us.

01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:27.697
Keep the faith.

01:16:47.592 --> 01:16:49.552
He your boyfriend?

01:16:53.097 --> 01:16:54.974
Lucky you.

01:16:58.978 --> 01:17:00.813
Carnations.

01:17:00.897 --> 01:17:03.816
- What?
- He'd bring me carnations.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:07.153
- So I got it wrong?
- Not at all, honey.

01:17:07.278 --> 01:17:09.447
- Don't.
- Okay.

01:17:15.495 --> 01:17:18.164
- Come on. Come on.
- Why, honey?

01:17:18.247 --> 01:17:20.959
- Gonna tell me why?
- No.

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:25.630
What's wrong, Jimmy?

01:17:25.755 --> 01:17:27.924
- You gonna tell me what's wrong?
- No. Not here.

01:17:40.061 --> 01:17:41.980
You gonna tell me what it is?

01:17:42.063 --> 01:17:45.108
- What is it?
- You know her, Jimmy?

01:17:45.191 --> 01:17:48.069
Jimmy, is it?
You know me, Jimmy?

01:17:48.194 --> 01:17:50.571
- Dil, this is Jude.
- You following me?

01:17:50.655 --> 01:17:53.116
Yeah! Just checkin'.

01:17:53.241 --> 01:17:57.245
- Has he been nice to you, Dil?
- Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?

01:17:57.370 --> 01:18:01.374
That's good. I'm glad.

01:18:01.457 --> 01:18:06.087
- Young love, as they say.
- Absolutely. The younger the better.

01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:09.966
- Doesn't come much your way, I suppose.
- Don't go lookin' for it, Dil.

01:18:10.049 --> 01:18:13.136
Well, maybe you'll
get lucky someday.

01:18:13.261 --> 01:18:15.930
Bit heavy on the powder,
isn't she, Jimmy?

01:18:16.014 --> 01:18:20.310
- A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
- Oh, absolutely.

01:18:20.393 --> 01:18:23.021
As long as she can keep it.

01:18:23.104 --> 01:18:25.857
Isn't that right, James?

01:18:34.657 --> 01:18:37.952
- It's her, isn't it?
- What's her?

01:18:38.077 --> 01:18:41.122
She's the thing
you had to tell me.

01:18:41.247 --> 01:18:43.499
Kind of.

01:18:43.625 --> 01:18:47.545
I'm sorry, you know that?
I'm really sorry.

01:18:49.464 --> 01:18:52.717
- You see that, Col?
- Saw it, Dil.

01:18:52.842 --> 01:18:55.720
- "Fuck it" is what I say.
- Yeah, fuck it.

01:18:55.845 --> 01:18:59.140
- Fuckin' men, Col.
- Fuck 'em.

01:19:00.266 --> 01:19:02.393
Fuck you, Jimmy!

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:26.459
- You could always make it up to her.
- How?

01:19:26.584 --> 01:19:28.086
When a girl runs out
like that...

01:19:28.211 --> 01:19:29.671
she generally
wants to be followed.

01:19:31.172 --> 01:19:32.799
She's not a girl, Col.

01:19:32.882 --> 01:19:35.551
Whatever you say.

01:19:49.023 --> 01:19:52.819
She went that way,
but you go with me.

01:20:22.181 --> 01:20:24.976
So, it was you all the time.

01:20:25.059 --> 01:20:28.479
- Who'd you think it was?
- I thought it was Dave.

01:20:29.856 --> 01:20:32.442
And who's Dave
when he's at home?

01:20:32.567 --> 01:20:35.194
He's at home.

01:20:35.278 --> 01:20:38.281
- Should blow you away, you know that.
- Yeah, I know.

01:20:40.408 --> 01:20:43.008
I'm gettin' emotional, and I don't like
gettin' fuckin' emotional!

01:20:43.119 --> 01:20:45.997
You understand, Hennessy?

01:20:46.122 --> 01:20:48.249
- Yeah. I understand.
- Fuck you too.

01:20:48.333 --> 01:20:50.251
Fuck you.

01:20:50.335 --> 01:20:52.629
Leave him alone, Peter.

01:20:52.754 --> 01:20:56.883
- He's in love.
- That right, Fergus? You in love?

01:20:56.966 --> 01:20:59.594
- Absolutely.
- What's she like between the sheets?

01:20:59.677 --> 01:21:02.847
- Definitely unusual.
- And who is she?

01:21:02.972 --> 01:21:05.683
Just a girl.

01:21:05.808 --> 01:21:09.395
You know what'll happen
if you fuck up again, don't ya?

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:13.024
- Yeah, I do, Peter.
- Good.

01:21:25.578 --> 01:21:27.747
So, what do you think
that is, Hennessy?

01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:28.957
A hotel?

01:21:31.376 --> 01:21:34.921
It's a knockin' shop.
Tres discreet?

01:21:36.005 --> 01:21:38.257
He visits his ladies
Tuesdays and Thursday nights...

01:21:38.341 --> 01:21:39.634
and Saturday mornings.

01:21:39.717 --> 01:21:41.469
That's his security
in the car beyond.

01:21:45.473 --> 01:21:46.516
Who is he?

01:21:46.599 --> 01:21:49.018
Doesn't matter who he is.
He's a legitimate target.

01:21:49.102 --> 01:21:50.395
Thank God for that.

01:21:51.729 --> 01:21:54.565
- You tryin' to be cynical, Hennessy?
- Hope not.

01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:55.858
Good.

01:21:55.984 --> 01:21:58.861
So, what do you think?

01:22:03.616 --> 01:22:07.078
Whoever hits him will be hit,
if those men are any good.

01:22:09.205 --> 01:22:12.250
- And I presume you can't get inside.
- Right.

01:22:12.375 --> 01:22:15.920
- So it's on the street?
- Right.

01:22:16.045 --> 01:22:17.922
Kind of suicide, isn't it?

01:22:19.882 --> 01:22:22.593
But then,
I don't have a choice.

01:22:22.719 --> 01:22:25.638
Oh, you do, Fergie.

01:22:25.763 --> 01:22:28.266
Of course.

01:22:28.391 --> 01:22:30.435
I forgot.

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:33.062
Come on.

01:22:33.146 --> 01:22:35.064
Rehearsal.

01:22:46.576 --> 01:22:49.704
You keep your mind
on your job, boy.

01:22:49.787 --> 01:22:52.874
- Then you'll leave her out of it?
- Aye. Then we'll leave her be.

01:22:57.462 --> 01:23:02.342
He's arthritic. Takes him two minutes
to get to the door.

01:23:03.968 --> 01:23:07.847
- And what if I say no?
- You know what. Go.

01:23:26.908 --> 01:23:28.910
Pardon me, young man!

01:23:39.963 --> 01:23:41.839
- You were made for this.
- Was I?

01:23:41.965 --> 01:23:44.342
- Perfect!
- What happens then?

01:23:44.467 --> 01:23:45.802
We'll be on the other side.

01:23:45.927 --> 01:23:48.638
- We'll move when you do.
- And what if you don't?

01:23:48.763 --> 01:23:52.058
- Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
- You may be right.

01:23:53.726 --> 01:23:58.189
Stay late at your work tomorrow night
and I'll bring you the gear.

01:23:58.272 --> 01:24:00.858
- Jude.
- Yes?

01:24:00.984 --> 01:24:02.902
Who is the old geezer?

01:24:04.278 --> 01:24:06.155
Some judge.

01:24:20.503 --> 01:24:23.506
- Why'd you follow me, Dil?
- I was jealous, Jimmy.

01:24:23.589 --> 01:24:27.343
- You shouldn't be.
- Why shouldn't I be jealous?

01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:31.222
Don't. My makeup.

01:24:39.230 --> 01:24:42.984
- She own you, Jimmy?
- Yes.

01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:47.488
- She's from Scotland too?
- Yeah, you could say that.

01:24:47.613 --> 01:24:51.743
- And you're not gonna tell me more?
- Can't.

01:25:01.336 --> 01:25:03.296
What you doing, Jimmy?

01:25:06.382 --> 01:25:08.635
I don't know yet.

01:25:10.845 --> 01:25:13.389
Do you like me
even a little bit?

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.479
More than that.

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:25.151
Come on. Let's go for a walk.

01:25:26.778 --> 01:25:30.698
- Do something for me, Dil?
- Anything.

01:25:30.823 --> 01:25:33.284
You'd do anything for me?

01:25:33.409 --> 01:25:35.286
I'm afraid so.

01:25:35.411 --> 01:25:37.872
You got the keys to the shop?

01:25:49.342 --> 01:25:52.387
Want another haircut, Jimmy?

01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:55.264
No. Come on, sit down.

01:26:03.147 --> 01:26:07.652
- You'd do anything for me?
- Anything.

01:26:09.112 --> 01:26:12.198
- No way.
- You said anything, Dil.

01:26:12.282 --> 01:26:14.993
A girl has to
draw the line somewhere.

01:26:16.327 --> 01:26:20.123
- Want to change you to a man.
- Why?

01:26:20.206 --> 01:26:22.917
It's a secret.

01:26:23.001 --> 01:26:26.129
Would you like me
better that way, Jimmy?

01:26:26.254 --> 01:26:27.422
Yes.

01:26:27.547 --> 01:26:29.757
- And you wouldn't leave me?
- No.

01:26:29.841 --> 01:26:32.302
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

01:26:35.221 --> 01:26:37.223
Go on, then.

01:26:59.203 --> 01:27:03.207
- You want to make me like him?
- No.

01:27:03.333 --> 01:27:06.294
I want to make you
into something new...

01:27:06.377 --> 01:27:09.464
that nobody recognizes.

01:27:22.518 --> 01:27:25.063
I don't recognize myself.

01:27:28.441 --> 01:27:31.903
No. Better in the dark.

01:27:31.986 --> 01:27:34.322
- So it's true, then.
- What?

01:27:35.490 --> 01:27:37.742
- You like me better like this.
- Yes.

01:27:50.046 --> 01:27:52.715
No, no. Dil. Dil. Come on.

01:27:54.217 --> 01:27:56.094
Dil.

01:28:12.318 --> 01:28:14.278
Turn around. Turn around.

01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.578
Baby.

01:28:27.458 --> 01:28:29.460
What you doin', honey?

01:28:29.585 --> 01:28:32.797
- Don't call me that.
- Sorry.

01:28:32.922 --> 01:28:36.009
- What you doin'?
- Try this on.

01:28:36.092 --> 01:28:39.137
- Why?
- For me.

01:28:39.262 --> 01:28:41.389
- For you.
- Yes.

01:28:48.855 --> 01:28:51.983
- What we doin' here, Jimmy?
- Look on it like a honeymoon.

01:30:04.555 --> 01:30:06.432
You a handyman, Fergie?

01:30:06.557 --> 01:30:09.686
Take a pride in my work.

01:30:09.769 --> 01:30:12.105
I sincerely hope so.

01:30:29.831 --> 01:30:31.708
Tools of the trade, now.

01:30:38.298 --> 01:30:40.341
And forget about the girl.

01:30:52.353 --> 01:30:54.272
Dil!

01:31:04.657 --> 01:31:06.534
Dil!

01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:10.872
Dil!

01:31:10.997 --> 01:31:13.082
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:31:13.207 --> 01:31:15.918
- I'm goin' home!
- I told you to stay in the hotel!

01:31:16.002 --> 01:31:17.879
I thought you was foolin' me.

01:31:17.962 --> 01:31:20.340
- I thought you were leavin' me!
- I had to go to work!

01:31:20.423 --> 01:31:24.135
I stayed all day in the hotel
thinkin' every noise was you!

01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:25.345
Come on.

01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:27.180
There's something you're
not telling me, Jimmy.

01:31:27.305 --> 01:31:31.434
- Come on!
- No! I'm goin' home.

01:31:31.517 --> 01:31:34.562
- Dil!
- So tell me!

01:31:34.687 --> 01:31:36.731
I was tryin' to get out
of something!

01:31:36.856 --> 01:31:40.068
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy!

01:31:40.193 --> 01:31:43.780
You... You gotta forget
you ever saw me, Dil.

01:31:43.905 --> 01:31:45.782
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

01:31:47.241 --> 01:31:50.119
Stop it, would ya?

01:31:50.244 --> 01:31:52.664
Give it over, Dil,
for fuck's sake!

01:31:56.042 --> 01:32:01.339
I'm sorry. I get nervous.
I've got this blood condition.

01:32:01.464 --> 01:32:05.093
Just help me inside, Jimmy,
and I'll be all right.

01:32:18.231 --> 01:32:20.608
Did you hear what I said, Dil?

01:32:32.954 --> 01:32:34.831
Get my pills.

01:32:37.375 --> 01:32:40.712
- What pills?
- Prescription for my condition.

01:32:40.837 --> 01:32:42.588
What condition?

01:32:42.672 --> 01:32:45.800
My condition. Ennui.

01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:58.688
Are you supposed
to take that many?

01:32:58.771 --> 01:33:01.316
Only in times
of extreme stress.

01:33:06.112 --> 01:33:08.990
See, they all say
good-bye sometime.

01:33:09.115 --> 01:33:10.992
Except for him.

01:33:11.117 --> 01:33:12.994
Are you all right, Dil?

01:33:13.119 --> 01:33:15.121
I will be.

01:33:16.831 --> 01:33:19.417
Go on.

01:33:19.542 --> 01:33:21.711
Good-bye, Dil.

01:33:26.049 --> 01:33:30.303
- Jimmy.
- What?

01:33:30.428 --> 01:33:32.388
Don't go like that.

01:33:35.391 --> 01:33:37.310
Can't help what I am.

01:33:55.411 --> 01:33:57.413
I knew you had a heart.

01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:06.422
Dil, can I tell you somethin'?

01:34:06.547 --> 01:34:09.384
I knew your man.

01:34:09.467 --> 01:34:11.719
You knew which man?

01:34:11.803 --> 01:34:15.181
- Your soldier.
- You knew my Jody?

01:34:17.058 --> 01:34:21.062
Lifted him from a carnival
outside Belfast.

01:34:21.187 --> 01:34:24.440
Held him hostage
for three days.

01:34:24.524 --> 01:34:26.859
You knew my Jody?

01:34:26.943 --> 01:34:29.445
- Are you listenin'?
- Yes.

01:34:31.906 --> 01:34:33.783
Got the order to shoot him.

01:34:35.493 --> 01:34:39.038
Before I could do it, he ran.

01:34:39.122 --> 01:34:41.624
Ran into a tank and died.

01:34:41.749 --> 01:34:44.752
- Died?
- Did you hear me?

01:34:44.836 --> 01:34:49.132
- You killed my Jody?
- In a manner of speakin'.

01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:54.971
- It was you.
- You should scream.

01:34:55.096 --> 01:34:57.557
You should beat my head off.

01:35:04.230 --> 01:35:06.691
- You killed my Jody.
- No.

01:35:08.234 --> 01:35:10.737
You didn't?

01:35:10.862 --> 01:35:14.490
- I suppose I tried.
- Tried.

01:35:14.616 --> 01:35:16.618
Don't you want to kill me?

01:35:20.204 --> 01:35:22.248
Bang.

01:35:28.671 --> 01:35:31.549
Don't leave me tonight.

01:35:31.674 --> 01:35:33.676
Might kill me too.

01:35:35.386 --> 01:35:37.472
Okay.

01:36:47.458 --> 01:36:49.836
What the fuck?

01:36:49.961 --> 01:36:52.797
So, tell me what
you're doing, Jimmy.

01:37:18.615 --> 01:37:21.075
Didn't really listen
last night.

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.953
I heard, but I didn't listen.

01:37:24.078 --> 01:37:26.289
Dil.

01:37:26.414 --> 01:37:28.416
That won't do you no good.

01:37:28.499 --> 01:37:30.501
Dil knows how to tie a body.

01:37:34.714 --> 01:37:38.134
I wondered why you came on
to me like that...

01:37:38.217 --> 01:37:42.096
- when you gave me the look.
- He asked me to see were you all right!

01:37:57.278 --> 01:38:01.240
See, I fix on anyone
who's nice to me.

01:38:01.324 --> 01:38:04.369
Just the littlest bit nice
and I'm yours.

01:38:04.494 --> 01:38:06.371
Stop it, Dil!

01:38:06.496 --> 01:38:09.958
Just don't kick Dil
and she'll be touched.

01:38:10.041 --> 01:38:12.835
Be nice to her
and she'll be yours forever.

01:38:16.422 --> 01:38:19.926
See, I should
blow you away, Jimmy.

01:38:20.051 --> 01:38:23.346
But I can't... yet.

01:38:23.429 --> 01:38:25.348
- Let me go, Dil.
- Why?

01:38:25.431 --> 01:38:29.560
- I gotta be somewhere!
- So try and go then.

01:38:36.234 --> 01:38:38.111
Where the fuck is he?

01:38:38.236 --> 01:38:40.154
Christ.

01:38:41.739 --> 01:38:44.534
Let me go,
for fuck's sake, Dil...

01:38:44.659 --> 01:38:48.204
- or they'll be here.
- Let them come, then.

01:38:48.329 --> 01:38:49.956
Can't stay here, Peter.

01:38:50.039 --> 01:38:52.667
- Drive around once more.
- Bollocks.

01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:55.503
See, I just want
your company...

01:38:55.586 --> 01:38:57.797
for a little while longer.

01:39:05.096 --> 01:39:08.558
- That fucker's dead.
- No, we are.

01:39:08.641 --> 01:39:11.853
You don't know
what you're doin', Dil.

01:39:11.978 --> 01:39:13.855
Never did.

01:39:23.031 --> 01:39:27.201
- Shit. Give me the shooter.
- What? You're crazy!

01:39:27.327 --> 01:39:30.622
- Give me the fuckin' shooter, Jude!
- Peter!

01:39:31.831 --> 01:39:34.083
Peter!

01:40:23.591 --> 01:40:27.595
I know all there is to know

01:40:27.679 --> 01:40:31.224
About the crying game

01:40:34.852 --> 01:40:38.731
- I've had my share
- You like me now, Jimmy?

01:40:38.815 --> 01:40:42.318
- Of the crying game...
- Yeah, I like you, Dil.

01:40:42.443 --> 01:40:45.613
Give me a bit more, baby.
A bit more.

01:40:45.738 --> 01:40:48.741
- More what?
- More endearments.

01:40:50.159 --> 01:40:53.288
- I like you, Dil.
- Love me.

01:40:53.413 --> 01:40:56.708
- Yeah.
- Tell me you love me.

01:40:56.833 --> 01:41:00.795
- Whatever you say, Dil.
- Then say it.

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:03.840
I love you, Dil.

01:41:03.923 --> 01:41:05.842
You do?

01:41:05.925 --> 01:41:09.429
- One day soon I'm gonna tell the moon
- Yeah.

01:41:09.554 --> 01:41:13.349
- About the crying game
- What would you do for me?

01:41:15.059 --> 01:41:16.936
Anything.

01:41:17.061 --> 01:41:20.106
- And if he knows
- Say it again.

01:41:20.231 --> 01:41:23.943
- Maybe he'll explain
- I'd do anything for ya, Dil.

01:41:27.822 --> 01:41:30.241
Why there are heartaches

01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:38.082
Why there are tears

01:41:38.207 --> 01:41:42.086
- You'd never leave me?
- And what to do to stop feelin' blue

01:41:42.170 --> 01:41:44.797
- Never.
- When love disappears

01:41:44.881 --> 01:41:48.468
I know you're lying, Jimmy,
but it's nice to hear it.

01:41:54.098 --> 01:41:56.768
I'm sorry.

01:42:04.734 --> 01:42:07.946
You stupid shit!

01:42:08.029 --> 01:42:10.531
Once was bad enough, but twice?

01:42:10.657 --> 01:42:12.659
You didn't knock, honey.

01:42:14.911 --> 01:42:17.664
- Dil!
- Get that thing off me, Fergus!

01:42:17.747 --> 01:42:19.147
What was that
she called you, Jimmy?

01:42:19.165 --> 01:42:22.418
- Fergus! It's my name, Dil!
- What's Fergus?

01:42:22.502 --> 01:42:25.546
- What happened to Jimmy?
- I said get her off!

01:42:25.672 --> 01:42:26.923
What's she gonna do, Jimmy?

01:42:27.048 --> 01:42:29.133
- She gonna blow you away?
- Dil!

01:42:29.258 --> 01:42:30.760
- Dil!
- Was she there too...

01:42:30.885 --> 01:42:31.970
when you got my Jody?

01:42:32.095 --> 01:42:34.097
- Dil!
- I asked you a question.

01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:36.015
Were you there too?

01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:38.977
You sick bitch.

01:42:39.102 --> 01:42:40.895
- Dil!
- You was there, wasn't you?

01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:43.272
You used those tits and that ass
to get him, didn't you?

01:42:50.655 --> 01:42:55.576
- She was there, wasn't she?
- She was.

01:42:57.704 --> 01:43:01.624
She used her tits and that cute
little ass to get him, didn't she?

01:43:02.959 --> 01:43:04.460
Yes.

01:43:04.544 --> 01:43:07.630
Tell me what she wore.

01:43:09.841 --> 01:43:11.801
Can't remember.

01:43:23.354 --> 01:43:25.231
I can't do it, Jimmy.

01:43:27.317 --> 01:43:29.235
He won't let me.

01:43:38.995 --> 01:43:41.372
You won't let me, Jody.

01:44:05.271 --> 01:44:07.398
You've got to go now, Dil.

01:44:07.523 --> 01:44:10.568
- Do I?
- Yes.

01:44:10.693 --> 01:44:12.278
Now.

01:44:12.403 --> 01:44:15.949
- Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
- Not if you go.

01:44:16.074 --> 01:44:18.618
- Will I see you again?
- Yes.

01:44:18.743 --> 01:44:20.662
- Promise?
- Promise.

01:44:23.122 --> 01:44:26.417
- Where am I to go, Jimmy?
- The Metro.

01:44:27.877 --> 01:44:30.046
- And meet Col.
- Yeah.

01:44:30.171 --> 01:44:32.131
Say hello to Col.

01:45:19.512 --> 01:45:21.472
You shoulda stayed at home.

01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:17.737
I got the multivitamins
and the iron tablets, hon.

01:46:17.862 --> 01:46:20.406
- Don't call me that.
- Sorry, love.

01:46:20.531 --> 01:46:22.492
- The white one's magnesium supplement.
- Stop it, Dil.

01:46:22.617 --> 01:46:27.121
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy.
I'm counting the days.

01:46:27.246 --> 01:46:30.083
Two thousand, three hundred
and thirty-four left.

01:46:30.166 --> 01:46:32.752
- Thirty-five.
- I'm sorry, darlin'.

01:46:32.877 --> 01:46:34.712
I keep forgetting
the leap year.

01:46:34.837 --> 01:46:35.880
Dil.

01:46:36.005 --> 01:46:37.465
What am I supposed to
call you then, Jimmy?

01:46:37.548 --> 01:46:40.134
- Fergus.
- Fergus.

01:46:42.095 --> 01:46:46.391
Fergus. My love.
Light of my life.

01:46:46.516 --> 01:46:49.519
- Please, Dil.
- Can't help it.

01:46:49.602 --> 01:46:51.270
You're doing time for me.

01:46:51.396 --> 01:46:54.941
No greater love,
as the man says.

01:46:55.066 --> 01:46:56.943
I wish you'd tell me why.

01:46:57.068 --> 01:47:00.571
As a man said,
it's in my nature.

01:47:00.655 --> 01:47:02.615
What's that supposed to mean?

01:47:03.658 --> 01:47:04.993
Well...

01:47:05.118 --> 01:47:08.288
there's this scorpion,
you see...

01:47:08.371 --> 01:47:09.914
and he wants to go
across a river.

01:47:10.039 --> 01:47:13.209
Well, he can't swim, so...

01:47:13.334 --> 01:47:15.920
he goes to this frog,
who naturally enough can swim,

01:47:16.045 --> 01:47:18.506
and he says...

01:47:18.631 --> 01:47:20.049
"Excuse me, Mr. Froggy.

01:47:20.174 --> 01:47:24.178
- Sometimes it's hard to be
- "I want to go across the river."

01:47:24.262 --> 01:47:26.180
A woman

01:47:26.264 --> 01:47:28.474
So the frog accepts the idea.

01:47:28.599 --> 01:47:34.105
- Scorpion hops on the frog's back.
- Givin' all your love to just one man

01:47:34.230 --> 01:47:38.026
Suddenly, the frog... "Aah!"
He feels this sting!

01:47:38.151 --> 01:47:42.864
- You'll have bad times
- "You stung me!"

01:47:42.989 --> 01:47:46.659
- He'll have good times
- "Why did you go and do that?"

01:47:46.743 --> 01:47:49.579
- The scorpion looks at him and says...
- Doin' things that you don't

01:47:49.704 --> 01:47:51.581
Understand

01:47:51.706 --> 01:47:55.793
"I can't help it.
It's in my nature."

01:47:55.918 --> 01:47:58.546
But if you love him

01:47:58.671 --> 01:48:02.133
You'll forgive him

01:48:05.136 --> 01:48:10.850
Even though he's hard
to understand

01:48:14.145 --> 01:48:18.232
And if you love him

01:48:18.358 --> 01:48:23.529
Oh, be proud of him

01:48:23.655 --> 01:48:28.451
'Cause after all
he's just a man

01:48:31.955 --> 01:48:36.417
Stand by your man

01:48:36.542 --> 01:48:41.005
And show the world you love him

01:48:41.130 --> 01:48:49.130
Keep givin'
all the love you can

01:48:50.473 --> 01:48:58.473
Stand by your man

01:49:26.676 --> 01:49:30.513
I know all there is to know

01:49:30.596 --> 01:49:33.391
About the crying game

01:49:36.769 --> 01:49:40.231
I've had my share

01:49:40.356 --> 01:49:43.401
Of the crying game

01:49:46.904 --> 01:49:51.659
First there are kisses

01:49:51.784 --> 01:49:55.330
Then there are sighs

01:49:55.413 --> 01:49:59.709
And then before
you know where you are

01:49:59.792 --> 01:50:03.588
You're sayin' good-bye

01:50:07.258 --> 01:50:11.220
One day soon
I'm gonna tell the moon

01:50:11.304 --> 01:50:14.599
About the crying game

01:50:22.190 --> 01:50:25.985
And if he knows

01:50:26.110 --> 01:50:29.238
Maybe he'll explain

01:50:32.659 --> 01:50:37.372
- Why there are heartaches
- Heartaches

01:50:37.455 --> 01:50:41.084
- Why there are tears
- So sad

01:50:41.209 --> 01:50:45.421
And what to do
to stop feelin' blue

01:50:45.546 --> 01:50:48.883
When love disappears

01:51:10.989 --> 01:51:15.660
- First there are kisses
- Kisses

01:51:15.743 --> 01:51:19.497
- Then there are sighs
- So sad

01:51:19.622 --> 01:51:23.793
And then before
you know where you are

01:51:23.918 --> 01:51:27.630
You're sayin' good-bye

01:51:28.965 --> 01:51:31.342
Don't want no more

01:51:33.177 --> 01:51:35.805
Of the crying game

01:51:37.265 --> 01:51:40.810
- Don't want no more
- Don't want no more

01:51:42.937 --> 01:51:46.899
Of the crying game

01:51:48.568 --> 01:51:52.572
Don't want no more

01:51:52.655 --> 01:51:54.991
Of the crying game
