00:17.808 --> 00:20.685
They call with their laptops. 

00:20.950 --> 00:23.433
Undoubtedly being 
complain about their perfect life. 

00:23.556 --> 00:26.015
Thursday is the most boring of the universe. 

00:26.089 --> 00:29.999
And with all the steroids they take, 
players have the air of monsters. 

00:30.102 --> 00:31.184
Monsters! 

00:31.335 --> 00:32.305
Monsters! 

00:33.035 --> 00:33.502
Monsters! 

00:33.820 --> 00:34.164
Monsters! 

00:34.183 --> 00:35.191
Monsters! Monsters! 

00:36.610 --> 00:40.580
Next week on FOX, look 
the new spin-off of The OC, Pomona. 

00:40.806 --> 00:43.102
It's still warmer than the beach. 

00:44.229 --> 00:46.118
If this game does not accelerate, 

00:46.146 --> 00:48.286
Special Halloween episode of Simpson will not run 

00:48.322 --> 00:50.548
the day before administrative professionals. 

00:50.848 --> 00:53.811
In this connection, let us not forget Dorothy something. 

01:01.966 --> 01:03.814
The trouble is painful .... 

01:03.905 --> 01:06.035
Turn radius accelerator! 

01:11.649 --> 01:15.091
Rodriguez sends it to right field while a case 

01:15.129 --> 01:19.790
beam accelerator bathes the stage in a green supernatural. 

01:19.880 --> 01:21.712
Oh, who would have thought? 

01:21.761 --> 01:22.991
It is always annoying ... 

01:23.101 --> 01:23.742
Faster! 

01:23.803 --> 01:26.108
But the very foundation of the universe could collapse. 

01:26.133 --> 01:29.021
Well. At least the Cubs will finally win. 

01:53.188 --> 01:55.846
Well done, idiots outer space! 

01:55.945 --> 01:58.416
You have destroyed the whole of existence! 

01:58.637 --> 02:01.634
Everything will be alright, I will just leave a little word. 

02:15.845 --> 02:16.226
Patty. 

02:16.313 --> 02:18.402
It's you or me who loves grape jelly? 

02:18.493 --> 02:21.030
For 35 cents, I like that! 

02:22.179 --> 02:24.377
Hey, Lisa. I bet I 
can jump in the pool here. 

02:25.087 --> 02:27.398
Bart, it would be the thing most 
t'aurais stupid as ever. 

02:27.533 --> 02:28.351
No. 

02:28.363 --> 02:31.107
The most stupid thing would be to do it over. 

02:37.944 --> 02:38.657
Mom? 

02:38.910 --> 02:41.116
Remember how you wanted 
can not grow forever? 

02:44.549 --> 02:47.372
I am afraid that your son is in a deep coma 

02:47.409 --> 02:49.427
which he never emerge. 

02:49.521 --> 02:52.153
I guess we should thank God he is not dead. 

02:52.421 --> 02:54.830
I know - that way, I continue to charge you. 

02:56.468 --> 02:57.525
Bart, wake up! 

02:57.621 --> 02:59.428
I dreamed that you bike! 

03:07.286 --> 03:09.357
Margin if you are missing your son 

03:09.415 --> 03:12.390
At this point, you could replace it with one of them. 

03:13.056 --> 03:13.954
A robot? 

03:15.277 --> 03:17.027
A child robot would be great. 

03:17.343 --> 03:19.372
We can make it confusing for his head explodes. 

03:19.699 --> 03:21.520
"This sentence is a lie" 

03:21.818 --> 03:23.918
But if it's a lie, then it must be true. 

03:24.072 --> 03:25.641
But if that is true, then it must be ... 

03:25.764 --> 03:27.719
Whoop! Whoop! Whoop! Kaboom! 

03:27.779 --> 03:30.401
And a robot you would forget your son died very quickly. 

03:30.487 --> 03:32.448
I thought it was in a coma! 

03:32.556 --> 03:33.995
It is almost the same thing. 

03:34.228 --> 03:35.851
Except that like that, I continue to send you bills. 

03:36.005 --> 03:37.362
You've already said that. 

03:37.433 --> 03:39.289
Well, you did not laugh the first time. 

03:45.545 --> 03:47.194
Your son is ready robot. 

03:47.473 --> 03:48.727
You want me to start it? 

03:52.167 --> 03:53.405
Mom, it hurts! 

03:54.345 --> 03:56.829
He knows how to operate all my buttons. 

03:57.176 --> 03:59.032
And voila how activate his. 

03:59.611 --> 04:01.973
I am a man who loves to strangle her children. 

04:02.024 --> 04:02.688
Do you think I can ... 

04:02.799 --> 04:03.844
Of course, try. 

04:04.059 --> 04:05.399
Kind of metallic ... 

04:07.953 --> 04:11.792
Wow! The trachea is incredibly responsive. 

04:14.656 --> 04:16.570
Yeah, that's the oh-sixes for you. 

04:17.813 --> 04:20.156
David is so helpful. 

04:20.197 --> 04:22.062
And it is with great neighbors. 

04:22.099 --> 04:23.058
Salvation salvation! 

04:23.156 --> 04:24.815
No bot is not a robot! 

04:26.925 --> 04:28.315
My Flanderinouilles! 

04:28.564 --> 04:30.544
Having a brother robot me. 

04:30.569 --> 04:33.196
The implications ethnic make me tense. 

04:36.785 --> 04:38.391
Farewell implications. 

04:45.464 --> 04:46.409
... bunga! 

04:48.002 --> 04:49.189
What ... 

04:54.890 --> 04:56.174
Even waffles, father? 

04:56.260 --> 04:58.441
Good and hot, Mr. robot! 

04:59.919 --> 05:02.905
David, you are by far the best 
son I never had. 

05:04.621 --> 05:06.894
You replaced me with this toy? 

05:06.963 --> 05:08.968
Replace is an ugly word. 

05:09.145 --> 05:10.252
There you updated. 

05:10.426 --> 05:12.212
Bart, we can be friends. 

05:12.329 --> 05:13.494
Will eat my shorts ... 

05:13.664 --> 05:14.861
I will t'obéir. 

05:24.107 --> 05:26.076
Make me a kitten! 

05:28.952 --> 05:35.502
   Johnny come lately the new kid in town 

05:37.842 --> 05:44.449
   everybody loves you so do not let them down 

05:47.162 --> 05:50.431
   you look in her eyes, the music 

05:50.713 --> 05:58.045
   begins to play hopeless romantics 

05:58.995 --> 06:07.456
   here we go again but after a while, 

06:07.507 --> 06:10.111
   you're looking the other way. 

06:13.494 --> 06:15.033
I hate going to the zoo. 

06:15.075 --> 06:16.558
I have compassion for animals. 

06:17.002 --> 06:20.120
Lisa, the zoo opened a whole new world for animals. 

06:20.359 --> 06:24.195
In nature, they would 
never experienced boredom, obesity, 

06:24.256 --> 06:27.214
the loss of a purpose ... 
You know, the American dream. 

06:29.455 --> 06:31.951
It's time to get rid of competition. 

06:39.885 --> 06:41.956
God thank you, I landed in a bird pens. 

06:49.251 --> 06:51.803
Is this where research on 
Stem cells led us? 

06:52.639 --> 06:54.897
David and Bart can not agree. 

06:55.019 --> 06:56.464
We must do something. 

06:58.792 --> 07:00.950
I'm really sorry, but our family 

07:01.061 --> 07:02.347
can not take care of you boys. 

07:02.384 --> 07:04.955
I hope that somewhere in 
bottom of your databases, 

07:04.955 --> 07:07.064
you recalculate good memories of us. 

07:07.101 --> 07:08.951
The bad news is that there was 

07:09.000 --> 07:10.855
a time when I had feelings for you. 

07:10.975 --> 07:13.307
I almost felt I was your father. 

07:13.373 --> 07:15.007
What are you talking about? 

07:15.318 --> 07:18.142
David believes - and your mother will be 
agree when I tell him 

07:18.155 --> 07:20.902
it is best for our family 
if you do not longer. 

07:24.538 --> 07:26.309
We will always toy store, right? 

07:26.391 --> 07:28.574
And I can take as many toys that I want? 

07:28.660 --> 07:29.740
No toys. 

07:36.031 --> 07:38.194
There should be a law that punishes the abandonment of children. 

07:39.114 --> 07:40.057
Do not be afraid of us. 

07:40.179 --> 07:42.843
We're kind of robots 
were rejected, like you. 

07:43.017 --> 07:44.682
I'm not a robot, I'm human. 

07:45.505 --> 07:46.331
Tell me, young man. 

07:46.442 --> 07:47.799
How does it feel to have ... 

07:47.885 --> 07:48.478
feelings? 

07:48.692 --> 07:50.576
I say that I was a human, not a daughter. 

07:58.551 --> 08:01.866
I think it is time for us 
us off for the night. 

08:05.477 --> 08:06.969
I can stay with you guys tonight? 

08:07.191 --> 08:07.902
Of course. 

08:07.976 --> 08:09.998
And maybe one day, you teach us ... 

08:10.171 --> 08:10.768
to love. 

08:11.066 --> 08:11.745
Yeah, maybe. 

08:12.028 --> 08:13.027
What do you do before? 

08:13.145 --> 08:14.218
I cut lawns. 

08:14.416 --> 08:16.254
I could cut grass at 3 different heights ... 

08:16.547 --> 08:17.434
but I could not love. 

08:17.624 --> 08:18.610
I understand it, I understood. 

08:18.629 --> 08:19.591
It is void to be you. 

08:19.702 --> 08:20.183
Good night. 

08:20.368 --> 08:21.169
Good night. 

08:26.366 --> 08:27.402
The name of a command prompt! 

08:30.736 --> 08:31.491
Our plays have disappeared! 

08:31.817 --> 08:32.621
We were robbed! 

08:33.020 --> 08:34.164
My pieces are gone. 

08:34.418 --> 08:35.860
This kid screwed us all. 

08:36.155 --> 08:37.147
It pissed me over! 

08:37.405 --> 08:38.712
You're a robot-urinal. 

08:38.988 --> 08:40.106
Lava-tron. 

08:40.443 --> 08:46.559
It's Bart! 

08:47.424 --> 08:47.698
Great. 

08:50.913 --> 08:52.278
I'm back! 

08:53.904 --> 08:55.056
You told me it was the cooking school. 

08:55.668 --> 08:56.628
T'as wanted to believe in this lie! 

08:57.539 --> 08:59.739
It's time to destroy the one who gave me that. 

09:01.946 --> 09:02.402
For me ... 

09:02.870 --> 09:04.354
you must first pass through your PE ... 

09:07.032 --> 09:07.998
It was my favorite pants! 

09:10.087 --> 09:13.970
The important thing is that we 
are again a family. 

09:14.271 --> 09:14.851
It stinks! 

09:15.130 --> 09:16.654
I have a small robot legs. 

09:16.823 --> 09:18.871
and a culture that is not equipped for an adult. 

09:22.788 --> 09:23.292
Dad? 

09:23.656 --> 09:24.543
Dad, wake up! 

09:24.747 --> 09:25.247
You're not a robot! 

09:26.406 --> 09:26.706
You're just possessed by the devil. 

09:28.190 --> 09:29.826
The power of Christ in order thee! 

09:35.666 --> 09:37.247
I will call for their job 
that we may not come. 

09:40.985 --> 09:41.424
Freak. 

09:57.440 --> 09:59.170
"Dear Homer Simpson, 

09:59.340 --> 10:03.390
"Mr. Burns invites you to a party 
hunting in his private domain. " 

10:03.760 --> 10:05.220
Open parentheses, "sinister laugh," 

10:05.220 --> 10:06.550
Close parentheses. 

10:06.770 --> 10:10.580
Please, Daddy, do not accept this 
invitation, hunting is a cruel sport. 

10:10.670 --> 10:12.710
Honey, animals do not feel the death. 

10:13.080 --> 10:16.180
It has been proven by scientists Buffalo Grill. 

10:16.630 --> 10:19.150
Stop your hay - Dad will kill wild animals 

10:19.440 --> 10:22.500
but I shot a bird and 
I gotta go see a psychiatrist. 

10:23.070 --> 10:25.390
He still believes that Hobo was a bird. 

10:29.980 --> 10:32.560
It is something quite bizarre, Burns who invites us. 

10:32.890 --> 10:34.330
What are his intentions after you? 

10:34.600 --> 10:35.250
Later. 

10:37.900 --> 10:38.920
Welcome! 

10:39.210 --> 10:42.090
Now I'll tell you 
I've been coming here. 

10:42.190 --> 10:43.610
Oh my god, I see coming: 

10:43.760 --> 10:44.920
He wants to sell his mansion in timeshare. 

10:45.340 --> 10:47.820
Well, I already have credits, then 
t'ait is you who have done! 

10:49.730 --> 10:54.360
You are here to participate in 
Thursday the most dangerous in the world. 

10:54.770 --> 10:56.420
"The game's most dangerous?" 

10:56.830 --> 10:58.160
What could it be? 

11:01.470 --> 11:02.720
What I will hunt .... 

11:03.220 --> 11:05.110
is you. 

11:06.210 --> 11:10.280
Now, since I'm too nice, 
I'll give you a lead of five minutes. 

11:10.500 --> 11:11.480
You can start to run! 

11:11.690 --> 11:12.830
Five minutes of racing? 

11:13.150 --> 11:13.980
Shoot me now. 

11:15.770 --> 11:17.030
Well, it broke the ice. 

11:17.480 --> 11:20.650
Now, any man who survive 
until noon tomorrow will win his freedom. 

11:20.880 --> 11:24.150
Excuse me, what gives you 
legally entitled to do that? 

11:24.170 --> 11:25.980
Tell me you're my lawyer. 

11:26.200 --> 11:27.970
Well, I guess you like hunting, 

11:27.970 --> 11:31.550
and you said in the past, 
killing people is part of my religion ... 

11:31.990 --> 11:33.370
I think I can do something with it. 

11:36.230 --> 11:39.040
Voila, it should stay away 
any courtroom. 

11:39.220 --> 11:39.850
Excellent? 

11:46.430 --> 11:47.450
The party begins. 

11:48.810 --> 11:50.050
I feel fear ... 

11:50.590 --> 11:52.210
mixed with curry. 

11:55.710 --> 11:56.370
You had me. 

11:56.750 --> 11:58.290
But I will be reincarnated! 

12:00.750 --> 12:02.410
You can not kill a Hindu! 

12:04.230 --> 12:05.210
Help me, Jesus! 

12:09.420 --> 12:11.690
You look at the championship killing, 

12:11.990 --> 12:15.380
the most violent spectacle of 
TV from the hip hop awards. 

12:15.710 --> 12:18.330
Mom, Mr Burns will kill Dad! 

12:18.600 --> 12:22.430
I had my doubts about something 
when we received this TV program. 

12:24.510 --> 12:27.050
For its first evening in this bloody, 

12:27.310 --> 12:29.170
Here are our guest analyst Terry Bradshaw. 

12:29.420 --> 12:29.740
Terry? 

12:29.960 --> 12:34.400
Well, we used to say good 
Race always beat a good hunt. 

12:34.570 --> 12:38.640
But the stats say, "bet on the guy with the gun!" 

12:42.180 --> 12:44.630
Dying is like golfer, except that golf ... 

12:47.770 --> 12:49.460
I hate seeing that. 

12:49.600 --> 12:53.350
That is the kind of image that distracts people from the sport. 

12:56.160 --> 12:57.040
Hey, hey, Homer! 

12:57.450 --> 12:58.560
Burns arrives, climbing! 

13:02.080 --> 13:03.100
Oh, fat ass! 

13:08.940 --> 13:09.740
You missed me! 

13:12.240 --> 13:16.430
Well, before I die, I'll scratch this 
lottery ticket that I have in my pocket. 

13:17.650 --> 13:20.190
"Jackpot, a million dollars!" 

13:20.560 --> 13:22.600
If I could get out of here alive, I could ... 

13:26.450 --> 13:28.980
Homer, Burns we only hunting for six hours 

13:28.980 --> 13:30.960
and you already resorted to cannibalism. 

13:33.910 --> 13:35.800
And there are bananas in that tree up there. 

13:35.880 --> 13:37.510
Ho, them seem a little green. 

13:44.040 --> 13:45.860
Carl, I see Paradise. 

13:46.640 --> 13:47.880
What does it look like? 

13:49.210 --> 13:50.300
Hurry up Lenny. 

13:50.400 --> 13:52.540
We'll be late for the plant. 

13:58.030 --> 13:59.530
You can not escape, Simpson. 

13:59.840 --> 14:00.880
You are not smart enough! 

14:01.090 --> 14:01.990
If I am! 

14:02.230 --> 14:02.630
I mean ... 

14:09.530 --> 14:12.680
Oh no! I was killed! 

14:14.080 --> 14:17.210
Fooled with the body of my best friend. 

14:22.860 --> 14:24.440
Is there room in the bag head, Smithers? 

14:27.050 --> 14:27.760
I can make room. 

14:28.900 --> 14:29.640
Excellent. 

14:36.240 --> 14:37.550
Voila for them both! 

14:38.090 --> 14:40.050
Marge! You saved me. 

14:41.370 --> 14:42.550
That was why it? 

14:42.810 --> 14:46.110
Stay out over 18 hours and not a single call. 

14:46.240 --> 14:50.680
Oh, I can not stay angry against you 
when the pot feels the sausage and onion. 

14:51.750 --> 14:53.820
And I am glad that you go well. 

15:00.110 --> 15:01.600
Very well, and now you have it! 

15:02.010 --> 15:04.790
Terry Bradshax your comments 
what just happened? 

15:05.040 --> 15:06.390
Well, it's a shame, Roger. 

15:06.560 --> 15:08.850
This channel shows a dozen gruesome killings, 

15:08.890 --> 15:11.540
but I bet she will go from 
the pub before these two begin 

15:11.540 --> 15:13.150
the tender act of love. 

15:16.210 --> 15:17.540
I spoke too soon? 

15:17.820 --> 15:18.830
Go! 

15:19.310 --> 15:20.590
It will live in my playbook! 

15:33.749 --> 15:36.562
Everybody is wearing a great costume. 

15:37.190 --> 15:40.370
Look, Grand Father disguised as a gorilla. 
Bob Tahiti in Spiderman, 

15:40.600 --> 15:42.202
and Nelson is a raccoon. 

15:42.562 --> 15:44.450
I'm not a raccoon, I am a lone Ranger. 

15:45.332 --> 15:46.880
But I am too poor to pay me the hat. 

15:47.698 --> 15:48.877
It is not even a mask. 

15:49.085 --> 15:50.070
It's fat turnover. 

15:50.269 --> 15:51.455
Do not listen to 'Silver'. 

15:53.965 --> 15:55.068
And now, the finalists 

15:55.267 --> 15:56.634
competition for the best costumes. 

15:57.014 --> 15:58.202
First, we have 'Blackula. 

15:58.613 --> 15:59.741
Because I am a black Dracula, I must 

15:59.915 --> 16:00.666
Blackula be? 

16:00.822 --> 16:04.785
My wife told me not to come to Dracula. 

16:05.157 --> 16:07.354
But I replied, "Bernice, 
we are in the 21st century ... " 

16:07.692 --> 16:09.177
Send him the standard letter of apology 

16:09.326 --> 16:10.101
for racist. 

16:10.262 --> 16:11.451
It is in the middle drawer. 

16:11.679 --> 16:13.254
Our other finalist is the ugly witch. 

16:21.513 --> 16:24.167
Congratulations, you win that purchase order 

16:24.331 --> 16:25.635
$ 25 at Kwik-E-Mart. 

16:26.238 --> 16:28.227
Jester. With $ 25, can not even have 

16:28.382 --> 16:30.037
half a cereal bar. 

16:30.354 --> 16:32.050
I exaggerate, but more seriously, 

16:32.219 --> 16:33.204
my prices are very high. 

16:33.455 --> 16:34.158
Thank you. 

16:34.423 --> 16:36.137
Wait! Before you leave, we would like 

16:36.282 --> 16:38.445
know which of our beloved 
this fellow is hiding underneath. 

16:38.625 --> 16:41.064
Lindsay Naegle? Helen Lovejoy? 

16:41.632 --> 16:42.544
The old Jewish? 

16:43.215 --> 16:45.654
No, I'm here. Disguised as my brother Irving. 

16:46.777 --> 16:48.270
Every day I miss it. 

16:49.898 --> 16:53.601
It is a bit tricky, because in reality 

16:53.737 --> 16:54.955
I do not costume. 

16:55.147 --> 16:56.262
I am a real witch. 

16:57.395 --> 16:59.127
Wait a bit, it's cheating! 

16:59.591 --> 17:02.668
Burn ... and make the purchase order! 

17:03.541 --> 17:05.365
Because technically, you are not in costume, 

17:05.536 --> 17:06.624
you can not win this award. 

17:07.694 --> 17:09.355
Make me my prize! 

17:09.720 --> 17:11.169
You will all pay. 

17:13.377 --> 17:15.700
"Taint of newt and of pond scum, 
thou shalt thou become donned the guise. " 

17:16.080 --> 17:18.375
By scum of the pond and the color of nine, 

17:18.596 --> 17:19.964
your current appearance becomes daily. 

17:20.250 --> 17:21.556
Speaks French, kind of stupid. 

17:21.826 --> 17:24.228
I will turn into your costumes. 

17:24.898 --> 17:27.340
You'll just say, or you'll really do it? 

17:43.374 --> 17:44.620
I'm not a raccoon. 

17:44.771 --> 17:46.313
I am a lone Ranger. 

17:48.960 --> 17:51.579
Disco Stu would have liked to disappear 

17:51.742 --> 17:53.024
McDoo as Marilyn. 

17:56.508 --> 17:57.643
Good luck to recover the bond 

17:57.803 --> 17:59.135
your disguises! 

18:02.822 --> 18:04.487
Seymour, I t'avais not tell you 

18:04.657 --> 18:05.853
in disguise G. I. Joe! 

18:06.117 --> 18:07.281
Mother, I'm fine. 

18:10.417 --> 18:12.652
This is not fair. I do not even wear 

18:12.806 --> 18:14.259
no disguise. 

18:14.844 --> 18:17.638
Look at me, I am a young gorilla virvoltant. 

18:18.014 --> 18:21.355
My hip is broken. 

18:21.501 --> 18:22.679
With the help. 

18:24.056 --> 18:27.183
Let's go to the hospital for a gorilla. 

18:29.164 --> 18:31.657
That's draw this poison. 

18:31.941 --> 18:33.448
But wait a bit ... 

18:40.655 --> 18:44.312
I'm not a 'Happy Meal'. 

18:45.128 --> 18:46.743
Listen to me, I am Oberon, 

18:46.950 --> 18:48.224
Queen of the Fairies. 

18:48.706 --> 18:51.590
You're a big cockroach, and you will die! 

18:56.973 --> 18:58.735
My spine is not 

18:58.889 --> 19:00.126
pole to its claws! 

19:00.515 --> 19:02.549
There must be a way to 

19:02.708 --> 19:03.703
deal with this bad spell. 

19:03.936 --> 19:05.330
Lisa, you think to take care 

19:05.545 --> 19:06.540
your father? 

19:07.035 --> 19:08.484
This is a great way to use 

19:08.682 --> 19:11.323
a brain great: deal with a stupid head. 

19:32.166 --> 19:33.084
Damn! 

19:33.419 --> 19:34.566
That is the solution! 

19:34.791 --> 19:36.362
Maggie is now a real witch! 

19:36.770 --> 19:38.138
It can cancel this spell. 

19:39.456 --> 19:40.764
I do not want to cancel this fate. 

19:40.979 --> 19:42.385
I can howl at the moon and eat rats. 

19:47.608 --> 19:48.585
I do not want change either. 

19:48.981 --> 19:50.757
I can get horses mud. 

19:51.023 --> 19:52.426
Girls will love! 

19:52.760 --> 19:54.691
And I'm Jared from the subway ads. 

19:54.885 --> 19:56.199
I have just a little overweight, and 

19:56.370 --> 19:57.666
ambiguous sexuality. 

19:58.089 --> 19:59.326
Do not listen Maggie. 

19:59.573 --> 20:01.072
Maggie? 

20:04.000 --> 20:04.959
Transforms me please. 

20:05.157 --> 20:06.200
This has developed a bee 

20:06.398 --> 20:07.541
unhealthy attachment to me. 

20:08.081 --> 20:09.363
I do not flower. 

20:09.532 --> 20:10.788
I am a flower! 

20:11.290 --> 20:12.563
Same for Apu-R2. 

20:13.097 --> 20:14.241
I can go in any direction. 

20:33.109 --> 20:33.739
Well. 

20:33.956 --> 20:35.923
Anyway, it's always good to be Moe. 

20:36.435 --> 20:38.410
Very good. This concludes the show 

20:38.559 --> 20:39.284
Halloween this year. 

20:39.497 --> 20:41.598
I hope you take 
as much fun to watch us 

20:42.052 --> 20:43.858
Koreen that have been conducting animation. 

20:44.305 --> 20:46.343
But there are some people for whom it is 

20:46.527 --> 20:47.590
Halloween every day. 

20:47.837 --> 20:49.303
I speak of illiterate adults. 

20:49.615 --> 20:52.490
For them, try to read the newspaper, 
it's terrifying 

20:52.667 --> 20:55.628
than any of the goblins, 
Goule, ghosts or spirits. 

20:55.979 --> 20:58.073
So please, make donations 

20:58.497 --> 20:59.482
to 'Children's book. 

20:59.762 --> 21:01.426
Together, we can their 
to read a slam dunk. 

21:01.680 --> 21:02.473
Dennis Rodman? 

21:02.702 --> 21:03.875
What are you doing here? 

21:04.060 --> 21:06.178
Community service 
after a speeding. 

21:06.350 --> 21:07.695
Happy Halloween to all!
