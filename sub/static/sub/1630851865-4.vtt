Snow!

00:39.519 --> 00:42.680
Snow! Snow, snow, snow!

00:44.440 --> 00:46.680
We gotta get out there!

00:46.839 --> 00:49.879
Just let me grab all my snow stuff!

00:50.360 --> 00:55.199
OK. I'll need my snow boots,
my snow shoes, skates, skis,

00:55.480 --> 00:57.720
cookie sheet, snowball maker,
snow brick maker...

00:57.879 --> 01:00.640
-Hurry, Ollie!
-...sled, shovel.

01:00.800 --> 01:04.920
Hmm. Better make that shovels,
you never know.

I'm ready!

01:16.240 --> 01:17.360
Finally!

01:20.399 --> 01:21.440
Bring on the...

01:21.560 --> 01:22.440
[gasps]

01:22.560 --> 01:23.440
Snow?

01:23.880 --> 01:24.960
What?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.119
Huh?

01:29.240 --> 01:31.479
It's already melted?

01:31.640 --> 01:33.360
Yup. We missed it.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.160
I'm gonna go sit in the bathtub
and have a good cry.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.960
Toodles.

01:38.119 --> 01:40.000
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.360
I'm sorry, Moon.
I took too long getting ready.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.280
But don't worry. I'll make it up to you.

01:45.440 --> 01:48.600
I'll plan a trip somewhere
with loads of snow, OK?

01:48.759 --> 01:49.880
I'll just need a week to--

01:50.039 --> 01:51.800
I can't wait that long, Ollie!

01:52.920 --> 01:55.080
Watcha doin', Moon?

01:55.240 --> 01:58.440
-Having a brainstorm!
-Oh, no!

01:58.559 --> 02:02.640
Best... sleidding... spots... ever.

02:02.759 --> 02:05.559
Wouldn't you maybe like
to research my travel book first?

02:05.720 --> 02:07.960
Nope! It'll be a surprise!

02:08.120 --> 02:10.759
They say it's the best
sledding spot of the moment.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.480
That's all we need to know.

02:14.000 --> 02:14.920
Let's go!

02:15.079 --> 02:16.480
[groans]

02:26.400 --> 02:27.720
Whee!

02:42.720 --> 02:45.600
Look, Ollie! I made a snow
mountain out of my yogurt!

02:46.679 --> 02:48.720
-Uh-oh! Ahah!
-Watch out for...

02:50.160 --> 02:52.040
my book.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.640
<i>Now arriving in the Sahara.</i>

02:59.560 --> 03:04.000
It's... it's ruined!
My book, it's ruined.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.799
All the fun facts. All the expert tips.

03:06.959 --> 03:10.120
All the... maps.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.720
I am really and truly sorry, Ollie.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.160
But you know
what'll take your mind off it?

03:16.320 --> 03:18.440
Snow!

03:21.280 --> 03:22.519
Huh?

03:24.519 --> 03:27.280
-It's hot.
-Really hot.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.519
I bet you could fry an egg
on the pavement!

03:30.679 --> 03:33.760
Moon, focus! We're here for snow!

03:33.920 --> 03:37.200
Exactly! So how did we end up
in the desert?

03:37.359 --> 03:39.440
This is exactly why I always plan things!

03:39.959 --> 03:42.799
And where is the snow? Could
you look that up in your...

03:42.920 --> 03:45.200
-My book?
-Right.

03:45.359 --> 03:48.119
No big deal. According to
my super-fast research,

03:48.280 --> 03:50.040
this is a top sledding spot.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.920
So there must be snow somewhere. Come on!

03:53.079 --> 03:56.079
We'll just do what I always do, wing it!

03:56.239 --> 03:59.560
Wing it?
Sure, that's one way to do things.

03:59.679 --> 04:02.720
But before we do that,
why don't we try asking someone?

04:02.880 --> 04:04.200
Over there!

04:11.000 --> 04:12.280
Ah!

04:17.159 --> 04:19.839
Hello! Can you please help me?
I'm looking for the...

04:20.000 --> 04:20.839
[Ollie Gasps]

04:20.959 --> 04:22.200
Sorry! For the what?

04:22.320 --> 04:23.159
Can you... ?
[Ollie cries out]

04:23.280 --> 04:24.360
Say again?

04:24.520 --> 04:29.080
You... help?

04:29.240 --> 04:32.120
Can... help... me?

04:32.280 --> 04:33.680
[Ollie shouts over traffic]
Can help?

04:34.880 --> 04:36.360
Ah!

04:37.719 --> 04:39.000
I know what you need.

04:41.760 --> 04:42.960
Larry!

04:44.760 --> 04:46.360
Hi, Ollie. Nice camel.

04:46.599 --> 04:49.840
I asked for snow, and they gave me Larry.

04:50.039 --> 04:52.240
Then he must be to take us to the snow!

04:52.360 --> 04:54.719
-How do you know?
-I don't. I'm winging it!

04:54.880 --> 04:57.640
Come on, Larry! Let's find us some snow!

05:01.039 --> 05:02.000
Come on up, Ollie!

05:02.159 --> 05:04.840
But I don't know how to ride a camel!

05:05.000 --> 05:06.840
If only I could look it up in my book.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.120
Come on! We'll wing it!

05:11.719 --> 05:13.719
Aaah!

05:16.680 --> 05:19.120
-Isn't this fun, Oll?
-Not sure.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.560
Whee!

05:20.760 --> 05:23.840
When's the last time
you think Larry showered?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Aaah!

05:29.719 --> 05:31.000
That's better.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.479
Aaah!

05:48.760 --> 05:51.039
When do you think
we'll get to the snow, Ollie?

05:51.200 --> 05:54.440
-Do you see anything?
-Just a whole lotta Larry.

05:54.599 --> 05:56.000
Hmm. Oh!

05:56.120 --> 05:57.400
Never mind!

05:57.560 --> 06:01.000
I see somebody over there.
Let's ask them!

06:01.599 --> 06:03.960
Oh, I can't wait
to go sledding in the snow!

06:04.120 --> 06:05.599
I can feel the chill on my fur

06:05.760 --> 06:08.039
and taste the cool breeze right now!

06:08.200 --> 06:09.359
How about you, Oll?

06:09.520 --> 06:11.960
All I can taste is camel hair!

06:16.800 --> 06:19.200
Hi! We were wondering...

06:19.320 --> 06:20.680
Any chance you have a...

06:20.799 --> 06:21.640

06:22.880 --> 06:25.400
Excuse me. A...

06:25.560 --> 06:27.880
-Apologies.
-Don't mind him!

06:28.440 --> 06:31.080
He's got a camel hair
stuck on his tongue.

06:31.479 --> 06:34.760
-A map!
-Forget the map.

06:34.919 --> 06:37.200
Do you know where we can use this?

06:37.440 --> 06:39.640
[mutter]

06:42.880 --> 06:44.960
That way? Thanks!

06:48.240 --> 06:50.520
-Whoa!
-You wanna come up?

06:50.680 --> 06:52.599
-Not really.
-OK.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.359
What you're doing looks fun too.

06:54.520 --> 06:57.440
See, Ollie? Everything's
working out after all.

06:57.599 --> 06:59.680
-Uh-huh.
-We don't need a map!

06:59.840 --> 07:02.680
-Uh-huh.
-We don't need a travel book!

07:02.840 --> 07:05.400
Uh-huh. We could use some water, though.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.159
I usually bring one bottle
per person, per day.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.919
You know what melted snow is,
Ollie? Water.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.719
It's going to be fine! We're winging it!

07:13.919 --> 07:14.760
[Ollie sighs]

07:19.159 --> 07:20.880
[panting]

07:23.159 --> 07:24.719
Winging it...

07:24.880 --> 07:27.200
We've been riding for hours, Moon.

07:27.359 --> 07:31.479
I'm so thirsty
I'm seeing things... like....

07:33.120 --> 07:34.840
[Ollie Gasps]
An oasis!

07:36.039 --> 07:37.880
A cheese oasis!

07:38.440 --> 07:42.080
Oh, cheese, beautiful cheese!

07:45.799 --> 07:48.440
Wait. I see it, too.

07:48.599 --> 07:51.799
Only it's a... hat oasis?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.560
-Yeah!
-Mmm.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.159
How do I look?

08:06.000 --> 08:09.280
-Wait. Hats?
-Cheese? Oh, no! Seeing things?

08:09.440 --> 08:12.200
We're in big trouble, aren't we, Ollie?

08:12.359 --> 08:14.719
Oh, why, oh, why did I make you wing it?

08:14.880 --> 08:18.760
And why did I take so long
getting ready for the snow?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.239
-I'm sorry, Ollie!
-I'm sorry, Moon!

08:23.239 --> 08:25.080
[cheering]

08:28.039 --> 08:29.359
Weird.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.280
Now I see a bunch of animals
sledding on the sand dunes.

08:33.559 --> 08:36.039
I see them, too.
Ollie, we're such good friends

08:36.159 --> 08:38.559
we're both seeing
the same imaginary thing!

08:38.720 --> 08:41.280
Or... maybe it's actually for real?

08:41.400 --> 08:42.240
[gasps]

08:42.360 --> 08:45.120
Sledding? Here? But that's crazy!

08:45.280 --> 08:47.400
That's wacky! That's...

08:47.520 --> 08:50.319
-Awesome!
-Awesome!

08:50.480 --> 08:53.040
This must be it, the sledding
spot you read about!

08:53.199 --> 08:56.480
It all makes sense now.
It's not snow sledding.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.000
-It's...
-Sand sledding!

08:59.880 --> 09:01.600
Ollie? Moon?

09:01.800 --> 09:04.040
-Scoot?
-What are you doing here?

09:04.160 --> 09:07.560
Woo-hoo! Actually, what am I doing here?

09:07.720 --> 09:11.680
Am I right?
Must've taken a wrong turn again!

09:11.840 --> 09:14.520
Oh, well! Hey, say, you look...

09:18.760 --> 09:20.120
thirsty.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.360
-Thanks, Scoot.
-Thanks... Scoot.

Aah!
