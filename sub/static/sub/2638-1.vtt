WEBVTT

00:00.080 --> 00:02.469
So you see, what you're eating
is not technically yogurt,

00:02.589 --> 00:05.024
because it doesn't have
enough live acidophilus cultures.

00:05.144 --> 00:08.235
It's really just ice milk
with carrageenan added for thickness.

00:08.495 --> 00:09.888
That's very interesting.

00:10.682 --> 00:12.937
It's also not pink
and has no berries.

00:14.699 --> 00:16.937
Yeah, but it doesn't
really answer my question.

00:17.193 --> 00:20.000
- What was your question again?
- Do you want some?

00:21.847 --> 00:24.193
- Right. No. I'm lactose intolerant.
- Right.

00:24.313 --> 00:26.321
- So, gas.
- Yeah, got it.

00:27.229 --> 00:29.158
Well... good night.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:44.290 --> 00:45.525
What are you doing?

00:45.645 --> 00:46.949
There's a draft.

00:48.220 --> 00:49.593
I didn't feel a draft.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.341
Why don't we just go into, your...

00:54.050 --> 00:56.768
Yeah, you know what, maybe
we should slow things down a little.

00:56.929 --> 00:58.917
I didn't mean
to go into your apartment to...

00:59.037 --> 01:00.671
- go fast.
- No, I know.

01:01.705 --> 01:04.608
I know what you meant, it's just...
this is only our first date.

01:04.775 --> 01:06.056
Okay, sure, no problem.

01:06.176 --> 01:08.613
Why don't we just figure out
where we're going

01:08.733 --> 01:10.757
and when we want to get there,

01:10.877 --> 01:13.798
and then rate of speed
equals distance over time.

01:16.779 --> 01:17.830
Solve for R.

01:19.623 --> 01:21.126
Or we could just wing it.

01:22.265 --> 01:23.735
That might work, too.

01:24.910 --> 01:27.160
- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

01:31.921 --> 01:33.502
He's coming. Screensaver!

01:39.103 --> 01:41.666
Hey, Leonard.
How was your date?

01:42.448 --> 01:43.530
Bite me.

01:45.507 --> 01:48.903
Sheldon, how could you just sit there
and let them spy on me?

01:49.063 --> 01:50.249
They were clever.

01:50.369 --> 01:53.616
They exploited my complete lack
of interest in what you were doing.

01:54.944 --> 01:58.145
You should thank us.
When future generations try to determine

01:58.265 --> 02:01.003
why your relationship
with Penny crashed and burned,

02:01.123 --> 02:03.179
this right here is the black box.

02:04.313 --> 02:06.795
What are you talking about?
The date went fine.

02:06.957 --> 02:08.797
She said she wants
to slow things down.

02:08.959 --> 02:11.889
Okay, so she said
she wants to slow things down.

02:12.009 --> 02:15.816
It's like saying,
"I'm really enjoying this meal.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.079
"I'm going to slow down
and savor it."

02:18.885 --> 02:21.473
No, it's like,
"This fish tastes bad,

02:23.120 --> 02:25.508
"so I'm gonna slow down
and spit it out."

02:27.769 --> 02:30.111
- You being the fish.
- I'm not the fish.

02:30.271 --> 02:32.249
Really?
Did you make a second date?

02:32.451 --> 02:34.490
No, we sort of decided to wing it.

02:34.651 --> 02:36.352
Even I know that's lame.

02:37.932 --> 02:40.563
Okay, all right,
let's assume your hypothesis.

02:40.683 --> 02:44.041
We went to dinner, we talked,
we laughed, we kissed.

02:44.202 --> 02:46.211
Where could I have possibly gone wrong?

02:46.371 --> 02:49.162
Think back, Leonard.
The littlest things can set women off.

02:49.282 --> 02:51.172
Like, "Hey, the waitress is hot,

02:51.292 --> 02:53.863
"I bet we could get her
to come home with us."

02:54.141 --> 02:56.018
Or, "How much
does your mom weigh?

02:56.138 --> 02:58.098
"I want to know what I'm getting into."

02:58.258 --> 03:01.684
- I didn't say anything like that.
- Good, 'cause they don't work.

03:02.526 --> 03:05.375
They also don't care for it
if you stare at them and hyperventilate.

03:05.495 --> 03:07.454
Sadly, that's my home run swing.

03:08.425 --> 03:10.323
Look, everything went fine.

03:10.808 --> 03:14.290
I didn't even have to refer
to my impromptu conversation starters.

03:14.958 --> 03:17.242
That woman across the hall is into me.

03:18.023 --> 03:19.452
Let's go to the tape.

03:21.548 --> 03:23.878
Look at her reaction
to the good night kiss.

03:23.998 --> 03:26.918
No change in respiration,
pupils un-dilated,

03:27.078 --> 03:30.109
- no flushing of the chest.
- Nice close-up, by the way.

03:30.750 --> 03:33.720
Interesting. Her jaws are clenched:
no tongue access.

03:34.003 --> 03:36.397
Clearly a bad sign
amongst mating humans.

03:37.765 --> 03:39.472
That's not a bad sign.

03:39.632 --> 03:43.226
Please, you might as well have been
two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.

03:44.137 --> 03:46.818
And the worst sign of all
is you're here and not there.

03:46.938 --> 03:49.907
I'm not there
because I'm taking things slow,

03:50.597 --> 03:53.945
which, by the way, compared to you guys,
approaches warp speed.

03:55.732 --> 03:57.624
And take down that camera.

03:59.809 --> 04:02.227
He was a lot more fun
when he had no hope.

04:05.477 --> 04:06.650
Give him time.

04:08.783 --> 04:11.131
Episode 201: The Bad Fish Paradigm

04:11.866 --> 04:13.769
Synch: Sixe, Jesslataree

04:25.511 --> 04:27.228
seriessub.com / sub-way.fr / forom.com

04:39.141 --> 04:40.125
Hi.

04:40.245 --> 04:41.378
Oh, hi, Penny.

04:41.498 --> 04:45.480
FYI, the hot water is inadequate
on machine two, so colors only,

04:45.600 --> 04:48.457
and four is still releasing the fabric
softener too early in the cycle,

04:48.619 --> 04:51.346
- so avoid using it for your delicates.
- Thanks.

04:54.859 --> 04:57.048
Good Lord...
why don't you just take your clothes

04:57.168 --> 04:59.702
down to the river
and beat them with a rock?

05:06.234 --> 05:07.717
Can I ask you a question?

05:07.837 --> 05:11.314
I would prefer that you not,
but I won't go so far as to forbid it.

05:12.475 --> 05:14.150
All right, I heard yes, so...

05:15.454 --> 05:16.611
Here's my question.

05:17.265 --> 05:19.014
Has Leonard ever dated,

05:19.466 --> 05:21.511
you know, a regular girl?

05:23.075 --> 05:26.258
I assume you're not referring
to digestive regularity.

05:27.574 --> 05:30.875
Because I've come to learn
that such inquiries are inappropriate.

05:31.774 --> 05:34.616
No, I meant, has he ever been involved
with someone

05:34.736 --> 05:36.279
who wasn't a brainiac?

05:38.324 --> 05:40.262
A few years ago,
he did go out with a woman

05:40.382 --> 05:42.502
who had a PhD
in French literature.

05:44.148 --> 05:45.807
How is that not a brainiac?

05:46.264 --> 05:48.685
Well, for one thing, she was French.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.706
For another,
it was literature.

05:59.426 --> 06:00.426
So...

06:02.122 --> 06:04.301
Do you think that if
Leonard and I keep dating,

06:04.421 --> 06:06.558
he'll eventually
get bored with me?

06:13.041 --> 06:14.877
- That depends.
- On what?

06:15.681 --> 06:17.964
Do you have a working knowledge
of quantum physics?

06:19.589 --> 06:21.059
Do you speak Klingon?

06:23.648 --> 06:26.594
- You know any card tricks?
- Okay, you know what...

06:28.518 --> 06:31.166
I get it.
Leonard has no business being involved

06:31.286 --> 06:33.975
with a waitress-slash-actress
who felt so insecure

06:34.095 --> 06:37.108
that she lied to him
about finishing community college.

06:37.268 --> 06:38.818
Why would you lie about that?

06:38.978 --> 06:42.093
He was going on and on
about this college and that grad school,

06:42.213 --> 06:45.330
I didn't want him to think
I was some kind of stupid loser.

06:45.632 --> 06:47.579
You thought the opposite
of "stupid loser"

06:47.699 --> 06:49.746
was "community college graduate"?

06:54.781 --> 06:57.345
You know, there are a lot
of successful people in this country

06:57.465 --> 06:59.172
who are community college graduates.

06:59.481 --> 07:01.145
Yeah, but you are neither.

07:03.502 --> 07:04.431
Right.

07:04.551 --> 07:08.308
Okay, this is between you and me.
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.

07:10.293 --> 07:11.934
You're asking me to keep a secret?

07:13.384 --> 07:14.700
Well, I'm sorry,

07:14.820 --> 07:17.844
but you would have had to express
that desire before revealing the secret,

07:17.964 --> 07:21.402
so I could've chosen if I wanted to
accept the covenant of secret keeping.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.699
You can't impose a secret
on an ex post facto basis.

07:27.580 --> 07:28.368
What?

07:29.318 --> 07:31.620
Secret keeping
is a complicated endeavor.

07:31.782 --> 07:34.125
One has to be concerned
not only about what one says,

07:34.245 --> 07:36.834
but about facial expressions,
autonomic reflexes.

07:37.347 --> 07:40.465
When I try to deceive,
I myself have more nervous tics

07:40.585 --> 07:43.008
than a Lyme disease research facility.

07:48.920 --> 07:49.965
It's a joke.

07:50.085 --> 07:51.921
It relies on the homonymic relationship

07:52.041 --> 07:53.967
between "tick,"
the bloodsucking arachnid,

07:54.087 --> 07:56.842
and "tic,"
the involuntary muscular contraction.

08:01.086 --> 08:02.500
I made it up myself.

08:05.246 --> 08:07.534
Okay, look, if Leonard
finds out that I lied,

08:07.654 --> 08:10.135
I will absolutely die
of embarrassment.

08:10.255 --> 08:13.162
- Physiologically impossible.
- Sheldon, please.

08:13.323 --> 08:15.331
Look, I am asking you as a friend.

08:16.776 --> 08:19.135
So you're saying that friendship
contains within it

08:19.255 --> 08:21.796
an inherent obligation
to maintain confidences?

08:22.051 --> 08:22.964
Yeah.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.682
Interesting.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.344
One more question, and perhaps
I should have led with this.

08:28.645 --> 08:30.390
When did we become friends?

08:33.092 --> 08:35.087
... i.e., I couldn't
become Green Lantern

08:35.207 --> 08:37.173
unless I was chosen
by the Guardians of Oa,

08:37.293 --> 08:40.274
but given enough start-up capital
and an adequate research facility,

08:40.394 --> 08:41.852
I could be Batman.

08:46.358 --> 08:47.655
You could be Batman?

08:47.815 --> 08:49.795
Sure.
I'm Batman. See?

08:53.218 --> 08:55.014
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Penny.

08:56.915 --> 09:00.451
If you're free Friday night,
I thought maybe we could go see a movie.

09:00.571 --> 09:03.296
Oh, you know, I think I have
the dinner shift on Friday.

09:03.617 --> 09:05.056
What about Saturday?

09:05.176 --> 09:08.306
I'm not sure; the manager
hasn't posted the schedule yet.

09:08.426 --> 09:10.391
- How about I let you know?
- Great.

09:10.660 --> 09:12.930
So you just let me know
when you know.

09:13.090 --> 09:15.362
Okay, so...
Oh, God, I am the bad fish.

09:18.054 --> 09:19.353
What did I do wrong?

09:19.663 --> 09:21.147
Why are you asking me?

09:21.483 --> 09:23.778
I have no information
about your interactions with Penny

09:23.898 --> 09:25.579
other than what you have provided me,

09:25.699 --> 09:28.110
nor do I have any method
of learning such things.

09:30.552 --> 09:32.283
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

09:32.603 --> 09:34.978
You seem to be implying
an informational back-channel

09:35.098 --> 09:37.290
between me and Penny
where obviously none exists.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.539
No, I didn't.

09:38.699 --> 09:42.108
I just think you need to be careful
how you phrase things, sir.

09:44.663 --> 09:47.913
- What's going on with you?
- I might ask you the same question.

09:48.033 --> 09:49.785
Why are you attempting to drag me

09:49.905 --> 09:51.886
into matters which have nothing
to do with me,

09:52.046 --> 09:55.464
but exist between you and Penny,
a person to whom I barely speak?

10:03.895 --> 10:05.672
What's wrong with your face?

10:06.554 --> 10:09.203
There's no reason
to bring my looks into this.

10:10.898 --> 10:12.135
Good day, Leonard.

10:12.255 --> 10:14.500
- What?
- I said, "Good day."

10:18.420 --> 10:19.532
"Good day"?

10:21.909 --> 10:24.339
Also today, we have
a fresh-caught Alaska salmon,

10:24.459 --> 10:26.907
and that's served
with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.632
- Our soup of the day is...
- You must release me from my oath.

10:33.088 --> 10:34.773
Sheldon, I'm working.

10:35.464 --> 10:38.380
- Why don't you take a minute to decide?
- Oh, my...

10:39.635 --> 10:41.173
I can't keep your secret.

10:41.293 --> 10:43.623
I'm going to fold
like an energy-based de novo protein

10:43.743 --> 10:45.358
in conformational space.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.578
Like a Renaissance tryptich.

10:49.145 --> 10:50.348
Like a cheap suit.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.407
Look, why is it so hard for you
to keep one little secret?

10:54.567 --> 10:57.661
I'm constitutionally incapable.
That's why I was refused clearance

10:57.781 --> 11:00.006
for a prestigious
government research fellowship

11:00.126 --> 11:01.763
at a secret military supercollider

11:01.883 --> 11:03.821
located beneath a fake
agricultural station

11:03.941 --> 11:06.696
12.5 miles southeast
of Traverse City, Michigan.

11:11.834 --> 11:13.941
Which you did not hear about
from me.

11:16.088 --> 11:18.004
Just forget I told you about me...

11:18.453 --> 11:21.475
- not graduating from community college.
- Forget?

11:21.635 --> 11:24.193
You want me to forget?
This mind does not forget.

11:24.773 --> 11:26.301
I haven't forgotten a single thing

11:26.421 --> 11:28.342
since my mother stopped
breastfeeding me.

11:30.033 --> 11:32.195
- It was a drizzly Tuesday.
- Okay...

11:32.996 --> 11:34.995
You promised me
you would keep my secret,

11:35.115 --> 11:37.033
so just figure out a way to do it.

11:39.064 --> 11:40.630
Leonard, I'm moving out.

11:42.679 --> 11:44.749
What do you mean, you're moving out?
Why?

11:45.083 --> 11:46.920
There doesn't have to be a reason.

11:48.797 --> 11:50.423
Yeah, there kinda does.

11:50.698 --> 11:51.863
Not necessarily.

11:51.983 --> 11:54.634
This is a classic example
of Munchausen's Trilemma.

11:54.794 --> 11:57.214
Either the reason is predicated
on a series of sub-reasons

11:57.334 --> 11:58.944
leading to an infinite regression,

11:59.064 --> 12:01.288
or it tracks back to arbitrary
axiomatic statements,

12:01.408 --> 12:02.816
or it's ultimately circular,

12:02.936 --> 12:05.313
i.e. I'm moving out
because I'm moving out.

12:08.070 --> 12:09.190
I'm still confused.

12:09.350 --> 12:12.044
Leonard, I don't see
how I could have made it any simpler.

12:13.516 --> 12:15.175
Hey, <i>qu'est-ce que s'up</i> ?

12:17.149 --> 12:20.013
We just got back from that exhibit
of those plasticized human cadavers.

12:20.133 --> 12:22.605
And some of those skinless chicks
were hot!

12:24.574 --> 12:26.847
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to pack.

12:28.357 --> 12:31.726
That's kind of an overreaction
to a little harmless necrophilia.

12:34.178 --> 12:36.926
It's not you, Howard.
He says he's moving out.

12:37.432 --> 12:38.776
What did you do?

12:39.286 --> 12:42.556
Did you change the contrast
or brightness settings on the TV?

12:43.634 --> 12:46.106
Did you take a Band-Aid off
in front of him?

12:47.555 --> 12:49.922
Did you buy generic ketchup,
forget to rinse the sink,

12:50.042 --> 12:52.066
talk to him
through the bathroom door?

12:53.477 --> 12:55.369
Adjust the thermostat,
cook with cilantro,

12:55.489 --> 12:56.968
pronounce the "t" in often?

13:00.931 --> 13:02.823
Did you make fun of trains?

13:05.270 --> 13:08.664
No, I didn't do anything.
He's just gone insane.

13:08.826 --> 13:10.751
We all knew this day was coming.

13:12.933 --> 13:14.107
That was fast.

13:14.740 --> 13:17.358
It's my pre-packed disaster
evacuation bag.

13:18.836 --> 13:21.644
It's recommended by the Department
of Homeland Security.

13:22.045 --> 13:23.414
And Sarah Connor.

13:25.134 --> 13:26.673
Where are you going to live?

13:26.793 --> 13:29.812
Until I find a permanent place,
I will stay with friends.

13:30.165 --> 13:31.062
Bye.

13:35.019 --> 13:38.186
You can't stay with me.
I have a teeny-tiny apartment.

13:38.689 --> 13:42.365
Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests
an aspect of <i>manushya yajna</i>,

13:42.640 --> 13:46.507
one of the five central religious duties
or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?

13:50.680 --> 13:52.209
I hate trains.

13:58.484 --> 14:00.885
Don't be ridiculous,
you love trains.

14:02.285 --> 14:03.637
Yes, I do. Come on.

14:06.567 --> 14:07.946
See you later, Leonard.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.034
This could work.

14:26.195 --> 14:28.077
This is a very old building.

14:28.449 --> 14:30.687
60 years.
It used to be a watch factory.

14:32.237 --> 14:33.083
What?

14:33.243 --> 14:35.308
Don't you worry
about the residual radium

14:35.428 --> 14:36.985
from the luminous dials?

14:37.663 --> 14:39.042
Not until now!

14:40.751 --> 14:43.557
I can't believe I didn't bring
my Geiger counter.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.588
I had it on my bed
and I didn't pack it.

14:47.589 --> 14:50.309
- If you're not comfortable staying...
- I'm kidding, I packed it.

14:52.096 --> 14:53.149
It was a joke.

14:53.269 --> 14:55.940
I was subverting
the conversational expectations.

14:56.244 --> 14:59.151
I believe they call that
the... ol' switcheroo.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.200
Terrific.

15:06.453 --> 15:08.271
Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?

15:08.391 --> 15:10.153
Yes, isn't she an amazing actress?

15:10.273 --> 15:12.706
Actually, I'd say
she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.

15:14.018 --> 15:15.546
How dare you!

15:16.133 --> 15:18.127
Aishwarya Rai is a goddess.

15:18.247 --> 15:22.049
By comparison,
Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.

15:24.396 --> 15:26.053
Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

15:28.249 --> 15:30.933
Obviously, you're not that familiar
with Indian cinema.

15:39.828 --> 15:40.928
Who is it?

15:41.282 --> 15:42.628
Strip-o-Gram!

15:47.044 --> 15:48.385
Tag, you're it.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.483
Shouldn't you put him
in a brown paper bag

15:52.603 --> 15:54.037
and set him on fire?!

15:57.010 --> 15:59.517
I've never slept
on an air mattress before.

16:00.812 --> 16:02.470
No lumbar support whatsoever.

16:04.168 --> 16:07.248
Maybe you'd be happier
on a park bench.

16:08.624 --> 16:11.181
I don't see any way
to get a park bench in here.

16:12.217 --> 16:14.781
- Do you want to switch?
- No, that's fine.

16:14.901 --> 16:17.734
I'm perfectly comfortable
sleeping on a bouncy castle.

16:20.775 --> 16:23.360
- Get out of bed. We're switching.
- Only if you want to.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.814
Just get in the bed!

16:25.434 --> 16:27.316
<i>What's going on?</i>

16:27.436 --> 16:29.813
<i>Are you boys roughhousing?</i>

16:31.500 --> 16:33.537
We're just talking, Ma!

16:33.657 --> 16:35.997
<i>If you don't settle down right now,</i>

16:36.371 --> 16:40.163
<i>I'm not going to let you
have any more sleepovers!</i>

16:41.087 --> 16:44.143
For God's sake, Ma,
I'm 27 years old!

16:45.101 --> 16:47.176
And it's not even a school night!

16:51.967 --> 16:53.057
Comfy now?

16:59.133 --> 17:02.003
That poster of Halle Berry
is a little unnerving.

17:03.734 --> 17:05.484
So don't look at it.

17:05.605 --> 17:07.818
She's like
my fourth favorite Catwoman.

17:07.938 --> 17:08.864
No kidding.

17:09.023 --> 17:12.076
Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer,
Eartha Kitt, and then her.

17:12.528 --> 17:14.077
What about Lee Merriweather?

17:14.239 --> 17:16.213
I forgot about Lee Merriweather.

17:17.056 --> 17:18.621
I'm glad that's settled.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.576
That makes Halle Berry
my fifth favorite Catwoman.

17:22.996 --> 17:24.704
It's Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer,

17:24.915 --> 17:28.467
- Eartha Kitt, Lee Merriweather...
- Please, I'm begging you. Go to sleep.

17:28.627 --> 17:31.084
I'm trying. I'm counting Catwomen.

17:36.033 --> 17:38.560
She did make a fine mutant
in the X-Men movies, though.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.040
- For God's sake.
- She's not my favorite of the X-Men.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.164
In order that would be:
Wolverine, Cyclops...

17:43.284 --> 17:44.525
I forgot Professor X.

17:44.685 --> 17:46.609
Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops,

17:46.771 --> 17:49.048
Iceman, then Storm,
Angel, the Beast--

17:49.168 --> 17:50.531
No, wait, Nightcrawler.

17:51.181 --> 17:54.743
Professor X, Nightcrawler,
Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, Storm,

17:54.946 --> 17:55.946
Angel...

17:56.808 --> 17:57.963
I'm coming!

18:02.149 --> 18:03.293
There he is.

18:03.495 --> 18:05.629
There my old buddy bud bud.

18:11.695 --> 18:12.841
What's with him?

18:12.961 --> 18:15.458
Koothrappali dumped him on me,
and he couldn't get to sleep,

18:15.578 --> 18:17.191
so I gave him a glass of warm milk

18:17.311 --> 18:19.744
with a handful
of my mom's Valium in it...

18:21.814 --> 18:24.162
but he still wouldn't shut up,
so tag, you're it.

18:29.007 --> 18:30.265
I'm ba-ack.

18:32.199 --> 18:35.200
- I still don't know why you left.
- I can't tell you.

18:35.402 --> 18:36.402
Why not?

18:36.680 --> 18:38.022
I promised Penny.

18:39.748 --> 18:41.332
You promised Penny what?

18:41.452 --> 18:43.382
I wouldn't tell you the secret.

18:47.915 --> 18:50.315
What secret?
Tell me the secret.

18:54.196 --> 18:56.022
Mom smokes in the car.

18:58.759 --> 19:01.602
Jesus is okay with it
but we can't tell Dad.

19:04.408 --> 19:06.855
Not that secret. The other secret.

19:07.017 --> 19:08.841
- I'm Batman!
- Damn it! Sheldon!

19:13.619 --> 19:17.075
You said Penny told you a secret.
What's the secret?

19:17.236 --> 19:18.802
Okay, I'll tell you,

19:18.922 --> 19:20.483
but you can't tell Leonard.

19:22.222 --> 19:23.359
I promise.

19:24.451 --> 19:27.067
Penny lied about graduating
from community college

19:27.187 --> 19:30.128
'cause she's afraid
she's not smart enough for Leonard.

19:34.751 --> 19:37.179
So it's nothing I did?
It's her problem?

19:38.152 --> 19:40.090
I drank milk that tasted funny.

19:44.882 --> 19:47.898
Penny thinks I'm too smart for her.
That's ridiculous.

19:48.058 --> 19:49.058
I know.

19:50.748 --> 19:53.329
Most of your work
is extremely derivative.

19:54.288 --> 19:56.549
And don't worry,
that's not a secret.

19:57.423 --> 19:58.692
Everybody knows.

20:04.342 --> 20:05.591
Hi. Yeah, hi.

20:05.711 --> 20:08.752
I know what's been bothering you
about us, and I have the answer.

20:08.913 --> 20:10.294
What are you talking about?

20:10.456 --> 20:12.582
First, I wanna say
that it's not Sheldon's fault.

20:12.702 --> 20:14.464
He tried very hard to keep your secret.

20:14.584 --> 20:17.680
If Howard hadn't drugged him,
he would've taken it to his grave.

20:18.629 --> 20:20.974
- He told you?
- Yes, but it's okay.

20:21.175 --> 20:23.891
Now that we know what the problem is
there's a simple solution.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.229
Pasadena City College?

20:27.613 --> 20:30.031
"A place for fun,
a place for knowledge."

20:33.850 --> 20:37.520
This man here is playing hackey-sack,
and this girl's gonna be a paralegal.

20:39.468 --> 20:40.577
Oh, I get it.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.325
Because Dr. Leonard Hofstadter

20:42.445 --> 20:45.246
can't date a girl
without a fancy college degree.

20:46.069 --> 20:48.957
It's really not that fancy.
It's just a city college.

20:50.043 --> 20:52.795
Right, but I have to have some
sort of degree to date you?

20:52.957 --> 20:54.507
That doesn't matter to me at all.

20:54.708 --> 20:57.425
So it's fine with you
if I'm not smart.

20:57.588 --> 20:58.709
Absolutely.

21:03.905 --> 21:06.337
Okay, this time,
I know where I went wrong.

21:09.478 --> 21:10.484
Bite me!
