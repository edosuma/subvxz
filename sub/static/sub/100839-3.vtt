-[Judy] Oh, hey.
-[gasps]

02:14.717 --> 02:17.595
Judy, Jesus Christ.
What are you doing in here?

02:17.679 --> 02:20.306
Just keeping Steve company.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.891
Okay.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.978
-And playing ocean sounds because...
-[sounds stop]

02:25.061 --> 02:26.479
'Cause I can't sleep.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.356
And I don't think Steve can either.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.775
Okay. I think he's asleep.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.736
Hon, I think he's the most asleep.

02:34.487 --> 02:37.323
Look, Judy, you can't be out here
in the middle of the night

02:37.407 --> 02:38.741
snuggling a freezer.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.077
I mean, what if one of the boys walked in?
What would they think?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.245
Okay, well, I'm sorry,

02:42.328 --> 02:45.915
but it seems wrong to have him
out here alone, trapped in this thing.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.919
Okay. I know that it's not
the ideal situation,

02:50.003 --> 02:52.422
but we agreed, remember?

02:52.505 --> 02:54.007
-Yeah.
-That the freezer

02:54.090 --> 02:56.050
-is the safest place to keep him...
-[sighs]

02:56.134 --> 02:57.886
...at least for now, right?

02:57.969 --> 03:01.264
Right. I just didn't know that I was gonna
feel this way.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.975
I don't think this is what Steve wants.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.894
Oh, God. "What Steve wants."

03:05.977 --> 03:09.314
I was in my room,
and suddenly, I smelled sea fennel

03:09.397 --> 03:10.815
-and cypress.
-That's horrible.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.025
That's his body wash.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.151
Oh.

03:13.651 --> 03:14.777
So then I come in here,

03:15.195 --> 03:16.946
and that motion light is already on.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.991
-It's a sign.
-Of what?

03:20.074 --> 03:21.868
That he doesn't want to be here.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.244
Okay.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.079
He hated confined spaces.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.749
Elevators scared him. Sorry.

03:28.499 --> 03:29.959
-He was sensitive about that.
-Okay.

03:30.043 --> 03:34.005
Listen, Judy, you have got to find a way
to put this out of your mind

03:34.088 --> 03:36.633
-so that you can start--
-I just want to stay here for a minute.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.885
You need to start to move on.

03:39.719 --> 03:40.553
Okay?

03:40.887 --> 03:44.766
How do I move on when he's frozen
50 feet from where I sleep every night?

03:44.849 --> 03:47.310
I don't know.
You have to compartmentalize, okay?

03:47.393 --> 03:48.728
Just try not to think about it.

03:48.811 --> 03:51.481
It's not what I'm thinking,
it's about what I'm feeling.

03:52.065 --> 03:52.941
[Jen sighs]

03:55.652 --> 03:57.445
-That was weird.
-That was Steve.

03:58.905 --> 04:02.075
I'm just saying, spirits have been known
to communicate through lights.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.368
It's a documented thing.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.912
Okay, you know what else
communicates through lights?

04:06.996 --> 04:07.830
Electricity.

04:08.706 --> 04:11.167
I know it's hard for you to go there
with the spirit thing,

04:11.251 --> 04:12.502
'cause it scares you.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.380
That doesn't scare me.
Rotting in a women's prison scares me.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.216
Yeah. I bet those places
are riddled with ghosts.

04:18.299 --> 04:19.300
Judy, I have enough going on

04:19.384 --> 04:21.427
without you projecting your spiritual shit
on everything.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.345
-Okay?
-Okay.

04:22.428 --> 04:26.266
See? No need to<i> Sixth Sense</i> ourselves
into a fucking heart attack.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.648
[Jen] Maybe there's something wrong
with the sensor.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.152
[rumbling]

04:38.236 --> 04:39.779
-Did you hear that?
-Yes, I heard that.

04:42.949 --> 04:43.783
Oh, God.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.203
-Shh!
-I--

04:48.496 --> 04:49.539
I am shushing.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.625
-Do you think that he's... in there?
-No, no, he's not.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.043
He's-- he's not.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.047
-What are you doing?
-I'm just...

04:58.756 --> 05:00.425
-See what's going on here.
-Oh, no. Be careful.

05:00.508 --> 05:01.926
You know I don't like the grabbing.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.053
[Judy panting]

05:04.137 --> 05:06.139
-Be careful.
-You're breathing really loud.

Thank you.

-No! No!
-No, don't hurt 'em!

05:31.706 --> 05:33.708
[theme music playing]

05:37.795 --> 05:39.714
[exterminator]
Yeah, you definitely got rats.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.258
-Oh, yeah, we know that.
-We met them.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.468
-See this?
-[Jen] Uh-huh.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.553
How it's kind of, like,
round on the edges?

05:45.636 --> 05:47.930
Mouse droppings are sharper.
It's the anal glands.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.850
-Doesn't seem like necessary information.
-I didn't know that. Interesting.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.643
Uh, so how do we get rid of them?

05:52.727 --> 05:55.980
Seal off points of entry,
set some bait traps. Pretty basic.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.899
But is it normal that there are so many?

05:57.982 --> 05:59.525
It's the heat, brah.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.152
Brah, it's the heat.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.278
Brah, I know.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.864
Rats can't regulate their body temp.

06:04.947 --> 06:07.867
They find a cool place, they set up camp,
especially if there's food.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.410
-You got meat in here?
-[Jen gasps]

06:10.328 --> 06:12.955
Uh, yeah, there's some special things
in there.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.957
Yeah, 'cause they can smell blood
from a mile away.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.126
They can't get in there, right?

06:17.293 --> 06:19.253
[laughs] Wrong.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.547
They got fucking razor-sharp teeth, dude.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.424
They'll Shawshank their way
through anything.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.847
[gasps] Okay.

06:31.891 --> 06:32.725
Oh, my God.

06:32.809 --> 06:33.810
-Don't touch that.
-I know.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.521
[Jen] Really? On top of everything else,

06:36.604 --> 06:39.232
now we have a swarm of fucking rats
we have to deal with?

06:39.315 --> 06:40.650
I'm telling you, it's a sign.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.568
What, that the world's melting?

06:42.652 --> 06:46.197
No. That we have to move Steve
before the rats tunnel in.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.241
-How do we do that, Judy?
-I don't know.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.992
But I think we should
explore some options.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.494
No, don't go in the Google!

06:51.953 --> 06:53.955
The FBI can trace your phone.

06:54.038 --> 06:56.582
Shit. How else do we figure out what
to do with a dead body?

06:56.666 --> 06:59.252
I don't know. All I can think about
is stuff that happens in movies

06:59.335 --> 07:00.670
that involve, like, wood chippers

07:00.753 --> 07:03.256
or dissolving a body in a bathtub
with whatever it is

07:03.339 --> 07:04.966
they dissolve bodies in bathtubs with.

07:05.049 --> 07:07.260
-[gasps] We are not doing that!
-No.

07:07.343 --> 07:10.388
No, I was giving examples
of things we wouldn't do.

07:10.471 --> 07:11.556
[whirring]

07:11.639 --> 07:14.892
There is a beautiful Thai Buddhist ritual
where they wash the body hands first--

07:14.976 --> 07:17.061
-We could put him in a suitcase.
-Jen!

07:17.395 --> 07:19.147
That is the man I was gonna marry.

07:19.397 --> 07:20.398
Okay, I'm...

07:20.523 --> 07:23.484
I'm sorry.
I'm just exploring options here.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.654
[sighs] What about a burial at sea, hmm?

07:26.737 --> 07:28.948
Steve loved the ocean.
He was such a strong swimmer.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.741
Okay, that is lovely,

07:30.825 --> 07:32.493
but I don't have a boat,

07:32.577 --> 07:35.037
and I don't have time
to get my captain's license.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.330
Okay, but we can rent one.

07:36.414 --> 07:40.209
No, because then the FBI will know
that we rented a boat.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.754
I really think that we moved too fast
past the suitcase.

07:43.838 --> 07:44.714
Jen.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.925
He's a person who lived a life.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.803
I think his soul deserves
to be put to rest with dignity.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.346
-Dignity?
-Yes.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.683
Judy, he left Ted to die.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.643
He used you to launder money.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.062
He-- he dumped you
after five miscarriages.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.398
-I know, but--
-No, he is a monster!

08:02.773 --> 08:04.525
Why are you worried about his soul?

08:04.650 --> 08:06.110
You should be worried about us.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.904
-Because I owe it to him.
-Why?

08:07.987 --> 08:10.448
Because it's my fault that he's dead.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.827
No, no, you weren't--

08:14.911 --> 08:16.120
You weren't even there.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.372
I brought him into your life.

08:18.873 --> 08:19.999
I turned him in, but...

08:20.458 --> 08:23.252
I never thought he would get angry enough
to try to kill you.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.798
[Steve] <i>Why, you are a mean fucking bitch.</i>

08:27.882 --> 08:30.259
-[grunting]
-[Steve winces]

08:30.801 --> 08:33.304
[both panting]

08:37.016 --> 08:39.310
-It's not your fault.
-It is.

08:40.603 --> 08:41.854
It is. It's my karma.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.942
-It's what I get.
-No, no. [sighs]

08:46.609 --> 08:49.195
No, it's not... It's not your karma.

08:49.820 --> 08:50.655
I promise.

08:51.906 --> 08:52.823
[sniffles]

08:54.075 --> 08:54.951
Listen, we...

08:55.993 --> 08:58.663
will get rid of the rats, okay?

08:59.330 --> 09:00.665
-Okay.
-Okay.

09:00.748 --> 09:04.001
[shudders] Then what do we do about him?
He cannot stay in there forever.

09:04.794 --> 09:05.711
No, I mean...

09:06.712 --> 09:07.838
not forever, it's...

09:11.050 --> 09:11.884
Maybe...

09:12.635 --> 09:15.179
Maybe just until the boys go to college,
you know, just...

09:16.722 --> 09:18.474
in case I have to go away.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.143
They'll be okay on their own.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.564
I mean, it's only seven years.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.607
That's a really long time.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.818
I don't know what else to fucking do.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.028
I just don't know
if we could live like this.

09:31.988 --> 09:32.863
We have to.

09:35.616 --> 09:39.078
You know, I gotta say,
every time we're in this house,

09:39.161 --> 09:41.205
the more perfect the two
of you look in it.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.957
Or should I say the three of you?

09:43.040 --> 09:44.250
-[both laugh]
-[man] Yeah.

09:44.333 --> 09:47.211
I hope you don't think we're paranoid
for taking one last look.

09:47.295 --> 09:51.340
Oh, God, no. Not at all.
I mean, this is gonna be your house.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.801
And now that the offer's been accepted,

09:53.884 --> 09:56.220
you can start planning how
to make it yours, you know,

09:56.304 --> 09:58.723
what window treatments you're gonna get,
maybe get some built-ins.

09:58.806 --> 09:59.932
We're having second thoughts.

10:00.016 --> 10:00.850
Come again?

10:00.933 --> 10:03.644
The inspection showed that there was mold
in the bathroom.

10:04.312 --> 10:08.024
Oh, yeah, yeah. I saw that.
It's really not that big of a deal.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.067
It's black mold.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.987
-Yeah.
-Yeah, but it's, like, trace amount,

10:13.070 --> 10:14.780
which is basically nothing.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.115
Well, if it was nothing,

10:16.198 --> 10:18.784
then the inspector would have said
he found nothing.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.703
Hmm. Yeah. You know,

10:21.287 --> 10:25.041
I feel that sometimes inspectors think
that they have to find something

10:25.124 --> 10:27.209
because you paid for the inspection.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.252
You know what I mean?

10:28.336 --> 10:29.170
Not really.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.130
[man] We can pull out of escrow
if we want, right?

10:31.213 --> 10:34.884
It's just, with a baby, we feel like
we need to be extra careful, you know?

10:35.718 --> 10:38.512
-Oh, no, I get it. I get it. I'm a mom.
-[woman] Mm-hmm.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.056
But honestly,

10:40.139 --> 10:43.517
I think we worry about stuff
that no one used to care about.

10:43.893 --> 10:47.021
My mom smoked heavily
through her entire pregnancy,

10:47.104 --> 10:49.357
and I'm, you know, fucking awesome.

10:50.107 --> 10:53.444
I just feel like because I know that
that mold is there...

10:53.527 --> 10:54.945
[man] It's just so hard to remove.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.281
...I won't be able to think
about anything else.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.700
Look, no place is perfect.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.871
You're not gonna find a house that
doesn't have shit that you have to ignore.

11:04.205 --> 11:07.958
I mean, I wish that black mold was
the worst thing going on in my house.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.505
[sighs] 'Cause I have rats.

11:12.838 --> 11:13.673
[man] Oh.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.843
[Jen] No, I know, Lorna.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.346
Yes, I told them that
trace is basically nothing.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.141
You know what? I don't know
what else to tell you.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.727
It-- it's not my fault
that they're fucking pussies

11:26.811 --> 11:29.063
that want to protect the life
of their unborn child.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.732
-[stammers, sighs] Bye.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.798

12:02.388 --> 12:03.597
Fuck you, Steve.

12:05.891 --> 12:06.892
[lock clicks]

12:18.320 --> 12:19.697
[Flo] Get me out of here.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.408
[Michelle] Mom, please calm down, okay?
Please, just--

12:22.491 --> 12:25.661
[Flo] You can't keep me in this place.
I want to go home.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.873
[Michelle] I know, I know you do,
but you can't live alone anymore.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.541
And this is a really nice place.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.501
There's, like, a year-long waiting list.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.795
If you love it so much, <i>you</i> live here.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.423
[Judy] I'd be sad to see you go, Flo.

12:37.506 --> 12:38.758
[Flo] I wasn't talking to you.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.844
Yeah, but your voice
kind of carries, so...

12:41.927 --> 12:44.764
-[snorts] Ballsy.
-Yeah.

12:46.891 --> 12:50.144
I realized that I forgot to tell you
that I teach a painting class.

12:50.644 --> 12:52.021
Tuesdays and Thursdays at nine.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.231
Mom, you might like that.
That sounds cool.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.316
"Cool."

12:55.691 --> 12:56.650
Did you paint that?

12:56.734 --> 13:00.613
Uh, no, I don't really do seascapes.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.656
Well, good, 'cause it's awful.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.492
She's an art critic.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.786
[Judy]
Oh, you're right. She's got a good eye.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.496
I mean, like, what the hell, right?

13:08.579 --> 13:09.997
-[Flo] Yeah.
-Who did that?

13:11.665 --> 13:12.625
I'm gonna get rid of it.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.752
Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.838
-You're just gonna take it?
-Yeah. You don't like it, it's out.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.924
-You didn't like it, Mom.
-[Judy] Yeah.

13:20.007 --> 13:23.302
Who knows what I'm gonna do with it?
I'm just lawless. I'm crazy.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.138
-[imitates explosion]
-Oh.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.807
It's okay, right?
You really don't want it?

13:27.890 --> 13:29.308
No, you can take it.

13:32.561 --> 13:33.395
Hey.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.524
-Um, thank you for that. I appreciate it.
-Oh, sure.

13:36.607 --> 13:40.110
And I apologize.
Uh, my mom is tough stuff.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.445
Oh, stop, she's not that bad.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.322
-Well, she's not your mom.
-No.

13:43.405 --> 13:44.615
My mom's a drug addict.

13:45.157 --> 13:45.991
So there's that.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.369
-Touché.
-[laughs] Um...

13:48.702 --> 13:51.080
You know, a lot of residents
hate it here at first,

13:51.163 --> 13:52.540
but then they start to like it.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.875
-Just makes it hard on the families.
-[sighs] Yeah.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.377
Can I get you anything?

13:56.669 --> 13:57.795
You want a coffee

13:58.212 --> 14:01.048
or a pudding or weed?

14:01.131 --> 14:02.216
-There you go.
-Yes.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.926
I was wondering when you would share that.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.095
-I was hoping you'd be wondering.
-[chuckles]

15:33.098 --> 15:34.433
Um, I'm not-- I'm not--

15:34.516 --> 15:36.477
Uh, I'm not trying
to get rid of a dead body.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.228
I was, uh-- That was, uh, autofill.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.066
-Getting rid of a freezer.
-Okay.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.402
Why are you here?

15:45.486 --> 15:47.780
-Playdate. Henry's in the bathroom.
-Oh, right. Okay.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.949
Yeah, I didn't realize that was today.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.665
If I were gonna get rid of a dead body,
I'd put it in Angeles Forest.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.292
-Wait, what?
-It's where gangs dump their dead.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.878
They say there's more bodies there
than trees.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.923
Oh, Shandy, how do--
why do you know that?

16:06.006 --> 16:08.759
I read about it on the dark web.
It's a good resource.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.011
Okay, gosh, you really just-- You have--

16:11.303 --> 16:14.056
You got a lot going on up in there,
don't you?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.309
Wait, what's your dad's deal again?

16:17.393 --> 16:18.310
He lives off the grid.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.687
[snaps fingers] That was it.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.939
Hey. Wanna swim?

16:22.481 --> 16:23.857
I'm kind of an indoor child.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.318
Okay, we could do karaoke.
You like to sing?

16:26.402 --> 16:28.404
Does a praying mantis eat its own mate?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.114
-It does.
-[Jen] Okay.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.283
Oh. Okay, cool. Let's go.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.494
Oh, my God.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.455

16:44.837 --> 16:48.882
Oh, God. Sick world. [sighs]

All right. Dark web.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.060
[Michelle] If I'm being honest,

17:00.144 --> 17:02.187
I thought it was, like,
the good daughter thing to do,

17:02.271 --> 17:03.772
but it was rough.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.692
Oh, wow, so she was living with you?

17:06.775 --> 17:09.987
Yeah, for a year.
It was a complete disaster.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.449
We were at each other's throats. [sighs]

17:13.532 --> 17:16.285
It's amazing that you tried.
Most people don't.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.747
Yeah, well, we're Cuban. It's what we do.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.623
Oh, I didn't realize that.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.042
But, um...

17:24.126 --> 17:26.336
then she broke her hip
while I was at work, so...

17:26.920 --> 17:28.589
I just can't leave her alone anymore.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.175
I'm sorry she's so unhappy here.

17:31.467 --> 17:35.054
[exhales]
Please. She's unhappy everywhere.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.806

when my dad died.

Sorry, this is not exactly fun banter.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.854
Well, sometimes you don't want fun banter.

Sometimes you just want--

17:45.522 --> 17:46.732

-Oh, I am so here for a sad chat.
-[both laughing]

17:51.153 --> 17:52.863
You have no idea.

17:56.825 --> 17:57.868
Honestly...

17:59.286 --> 18:00.162
it sucks.

18:01.705 --> 18:04.249
My mom used to be so... cool.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.668
-She was funny...
-[exhales]

18:06.752 --> 18:09.671
...and, like, vibrant. [sighs]

18:10.214 --> 18:12.049
And it's like, after my dad, she just...

18:12.841 --> 18:14.635
withdrew, you know?

18:14.718 --> 18:19.139
Like, she felt guilty being happy
or something, like it was a betrayal.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.227
I mean, yeah, I get that.

18:23.310 --> 18:25.020
[Michelle] I don't. I think it's selfish.

18:26.814 --> 18:27.648
Really?

18:27.731 --> 18:29.108
I mean, come on, like,

18:29.191 --> 18:31.610
we're all gonna die at some point,
you know?

18:32.486 --> 18:34.571
It's life. It's what happens.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.241
But the world keeps going, and...

18:38.492 --> 18:40.160
other people need you.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.664
It's like you have a choice:

18:43.747 --> 18:46.291
You either go down with the ship or...

18:47.292 --> 18:50.921
you grab a fucking life raft
and you hold on, you know?

18:51.880 --> 18:53.966
Yeah. Yes.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.760
Wow. Yes.

18:57.302 --> 19:00.639
It's like in <i>Titanic,</i> like,
do you want to be Leo,

19:01.306 --> 19:03.600
or do you want to be the old lady
who lives forever?

19:04.059 --> 19:05.018
Well, I mean,

19:05.352 --> 19:09.064
I definitely want to be the old lady,
but I'm not quite sure she lives forever.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.692
[laughs] She doesn't?

19:11.775 --> 19:15.946
-No. Her heart will go on and on...
-[both laughing]

19:16.029 --> 19:18.866
...but pretty sure her body gives out
at some point.

19:18.949 --> 19:22.661
[Michelle] Aw, man, I really misunderstood
that movie as a kid.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.112
What are you doing in here?
Honey, that door was locked.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.530
No, it wasn't.

19:58.614 --> 19:59.990
What's with the oven mitts?

20:00.073 --> 20:02.367
[stuttering]
Okay, I need you guys to get out of here.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.995
-Why?
-Because-- because it's not safe.

20:05.078 --> 20:06.580
-Why?
-Because we have rats.

20:06.663 --> 20:08.790
Will you please stop asking?
I need you to get out of here.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.042
[Henry] When did we get rats?

20:10.125 --> 20:11.835
Did you know that rats' teeth
never stop--

20:11.919 --> 20:14.171
Okay, I just need you
to get the fuck out of here!

20:17.799 --> 20:19.134
[stammers] I'm sorry.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.094
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry I yelled.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.805
Okay, I'm just...
I'm a little stressed right now.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.557
What, um...

20:26.225 --> 20:27.267
What did you need?

20:28.477 --> 20:29.519
You wanted peanut butter?

20:29.603 --> 20:31.480
-No.
-[Jen] You want me to make you a snack?

Something stuck in your pipes?

21:06.181 --> 21:07.933
Yeah. Yeah, something's stuck.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.143
This will dissolve anything,
including your skin.

and a mask just to be safe.

-You're welcome. Have a great day.

It's just-- it's some hair.

but I don't like that.

-No, no, no. It was a rat.
-Open the freezer.

-I want to see him!
-No, you don't. It was just a rat.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.430
You don't want to see him.

-Trust me.
-Trust you?

How can I trust you
when you were upstairs with that--

23:13.934 --> 23:15.685
He's in here, okay?

23:15.769 --> 23:17.354
He's in here. I was just...

23:17.521 --> 23:21.024
[stammers] I was just trying something,
because you're right, I can't do this.

23:21.108 --> 23:24.152
I can't do this. I have to get him out of
this house. I have to get him out of here.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.821
What happened to
"wait until the kids are in college"?

23:25.904 --> 23:28.698
