WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:04.568
OK. A buck says Brad goes to the party.

00:04.671 --> 00:06.036
All righty.

00:06.139 --> 00:10.098
Another dollar says Brad's been feeling
like a loser since Angela dumped him.

00:10.176 --> 00:12.440
And there's no way
he's going to that party.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.673
Well, we all know Brad's a loser.

00:14.781 --> 00:17.079
But I still say
he's going to the party.

00:17.150 --> 00:19.846
You're betting on Brad's social life?

00:19.919 --> 00:22.410
Actually, I'm betting against it.

00:23.323 --> 00:26.690
Gambling on your brother's broken heart.
That's really nice, guys.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.787
Still time to get into the Brad party
pool? I got a buck says he's not going.

00:32.631 --> 00:35.192
You can't bet against your own son.

00:35.301 --> 00:37.667
Why? How are you betting?

00:39.172 --> 00:42.733
I would've gotten in the action earlier,
but I pulled my back out.

00:42.842 --> 00:45.140
- How'd you do that?
- Don't ask.

00:47.313 --> 00:49.281
I decided I'm not going to the party.

00:49.349 --> 00:51.112
Yes!

00:51.818 --> 00:53.513
All right, thank you very much.

00:53.586 --> 00:56.555
Your lack of self-esteem
has made me a very rich man.

00:57.557 --> 01:00.526
- Brad, you have to go to this party.
- You think so?

01:00.627 --> 01:02.720
You can't stay locked
in your room forever

01:02.796 --> 01:05.629
just cause you got dumped
by dingbat, motormouth Angela,

01:05.698 --> 01:08.929
who, by the way, I really liked
in case you get back together.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.404
- I'll go for a little while.
- All right.

01:11.504 --> 01:14.405
- All right.
- All right. I'll be back by 11:00.

01:14.474 --> 01:17.375
- You don't have to come back early.
- How about 11:30?

01:17.444 --> 01:20.811
You're staying out till past midnight,
no more arguments!

02:13.366 --> 02:15.698
- What's that smell?
- I don't smell anything.

02:15.768 --> 02:20.068
Oh, man! You still haven't
learned how to load a dishwasher.

02:22.942 --> 02:25.069
It's a subjective thing, honey.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.613
Look, the Salvador Dali Collection.

02:29.382 --> 02:32.351
- Did I miss breakfast?
- And lunch.

02:32.418 --> 02:35.751
- When did you get in? About 12:30?
- Yes, I did.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.881
Did you meet somebody?

02:37.957 --> 02:39.424
Yes, I did.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.427
He met somebody.
Isn't that adorable?

02:42.495 --> 02:44.827
- What's her name?
- Samantha.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.866
Samantha.

02:46.966 --> 02:50.265
Adorable. What is she like?

02:50.336 --> 02:54.432
Well, she's really cute, she loves
sports, and she drives a '68 Camaro.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.668
Camaro? Adorable.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.609
So, when are you gonna see her again?

03:01.714 --> 03:04.547
Soon as I open the door. She's
taking me to the Red Wings game.

03:04.617 --> 03:06.983
Red Wings? Adorable!

03:08.188 --> 03:09.655
- How you doing?
- Hi.

03:09.722 --> 03:11.815
Meet my mom and dad.
This is Samantha Hayes.

03:11.891 --> 03:13.950
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.052
- I'm Jill.
- Hi, Samantha. Tim Taylor.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.791
- It's nice to meet you.
- Brad was telling us about you.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.765
- Well, good things, I hope.
- Yeah.

03:20.833 --> 03:24.064
Before we let you out,
there's a few things we need to know.

03:24.137 --> 03:27.106
- Uh, Dad...?
- I'm doing this for your own good.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.574
Samantha, that Camaro...
is it a big block?

03:31.277 --> 03:33.177
You'll have to excuse my husband.

03:33.246 --> 03:38.081
He gets very concerned about his son
getting mixed up with the wrong... car.

03:39.886 --> 03:43.117
- You guys go to the same school?
- No. Samantha goes to Wayne State.

03:44.457 --> 03:47.426
- College?
- Yeah. I'm majoring in communications.

03:47.493 --> 03:50.792
- I want to be a sportscaster.
- She knows everything about soccer.

03:50.863 --> 03:55.232
Great. So you're one of those kids that
shot through high school to college?

03:55.335 --> 03:57.769
No. I started when I was 18.
I'm a junior now.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.805
Yeah, we're both juniors.

04:01.841 --> 04:04.275
Except you're in high school.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.039
Oh, it's hard to believe.

04:06.112 --> 04:10.845
Brad is more responsible and polite than
the college guys I've gone out with.

04:10.917 --> 04:14.683
- You raised a real gentleman.
- I didn't know we were finished.

04:16.488 --> 04:19.322
- Well, we should be going.
- Bye.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.725
- OK. Bye, guys. Have a good time.
- Nice to meet you. Have fun.

04:22.795 --> 04:24.456
All right.

04:26.499 --> 04:30.162
Well, I really wasrt ready for that.

04:30.236 --> 04:34.070
Wait, wait. Hold it. If she went to
college when she was 18, she's a junior,

04:34.140 --> 04:36.904
that would make her... well, older.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.445
She's at least 20.

04:40.513 --> 04:42.674
- Who's 20?
- This girl Brad's going out with.

04:42.749 --> 04:46.412
What would a 20-year-old woman
want with Brad?

04:46.486 --> 04:49.421
Maybe where she lives
she's not allowed to have a dog.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.559
Are you OK with this?

04:56.663 --> 04:58.597
Yeah. She seems like she's very nice.

04:58.665 --> 05:01.634
- Brad's just a boy.
- Oh, come on, Mom!

05:01.701 --> 05:05.364
Younger girls date older guys all
the time. No one says anything about it.

05:05.438 --> 05:07.804
- You have a double standard.
- He's right.

05:07.874 --> 05:10.843
I love you.
But sometimes you can be a bit sexist.

05:16.349 --> 05:20.718
Well, it's our two-week anniversary. We
should go somewhere special for dinner.

05:20.787 --> 05:23.153
Yeah. How about...

05:23.222 --> 05:24.712
Chinese!

05:24.791 --> 05:26.918
- I know this great place.
- Hong Fat's?

05:26.993 --> 05:30.861
- You know Hong Fat?
- I knew him when he was Hong Thin.

05:32.231 --> 05:34.096
I knew you were gonna say that.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.769
- You did?
- Yeah.

05:36.836 --> 05:41.705
I just can't believe
I only met you two weeks ago.

05:41.774 --> 05:45.835
Yeah. It kind of feels like
we've known each other our whole lives.

05:45.912 --> 05:48.676
How was I lucky enough
to meet a guy like you?

05:48.781 --> 05:52.114
Well, I guess we were at
the right place at the right time.

05:53.953 --> 05:56.387
Two strangers reaching for onion dip.

06:00.426 --> 06:05.125
So, when was the exact moment
you knew I really, really liked you?

06:05.198 --> 06:09.430
I guess when you met my parents
and you didn't run away screaming.

06:13.473 --> 06:14.997
OK, Samantha. I got it.

06:15.074 --> 06:19.010
You want to meet Brad for dinner
at Bangles at 9:00.

06:19.078 --> 06:21.103
OK. Bye now.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.714
Dinner at 9:00.

06:24.784 --> 06:28.083
Just a couple of years ago
he was going to bed at 9:00.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.756
A couple years from now
we'll be going to bed at 9:00.

06:34.927 --> 06:39.421
Brad has spent every available moment
with Samantha for the last month.

06:39.499 --> 06:42.024
They're going too fast. I don't like it.

06:42.101 --> 06:45.935
I'm not so sure. His school work
isn't suffering. His job's OK.

06:46.005 --> 06:50.066
He's coming in every night at curfew.
Samantha's a better parent than we are.

06:51.577 --> 06:54.307
- Hey, everybody!
- There's a note for you on the counter.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.782
- Nice jacket.
- Oh, you like it?

06:56.849 --> 06:58.874
- Yeah.
- Samantha helped me pick it out.

06:58.951 --> 07:01.112
She says "dress for who you want to be."

07:01.187 --> 07:03.212
Who do you want to be?

07:03.289 --> 07:06.850
I don't know. I just figure I'll put on
the clothes and see who I turn into.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.853
You've been learning
an awful lot from Samantha?

07:11.931 --> 07:16.163
<i>It's great. You're not gonna believe,
she wants me to take her to Tool Time.</i>

07:16.235 --> 07:17.361
Yeah?

07:17.437 --> 07:21.168
There's something seriously wrong
with this woman.

07:21.908 --> 07:24.877
Funny. I'm starting to like her a lot.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.571
She's thinking about being in TV,

07:26.646 --> 07:29.171
she wants to see what it's like
to tape a live show.

07:29.248 --> 07:33.412
Brad, do you think maybe you're moving
a little fast in this relationship?

07:33.486 --> 07:36.250
We're moving fast
because we really like each other.

07:36.322 --> 07:40.816
Brad, I think the point is
she is three years older than you.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.987
And, um, we're just worried that...

07:44.063 --> 07:46.224
...maybe you're getting in too deep.

07:46.332 --> 07:48.391
You're three years older than Mom.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.732
Look how deep I'm in.

07:59.612 --> 08:02.103
<i>Thank you. Welcome back
to Tool Time's salute...</i>

08:04.784 --> 08:06.649
...to shaving.

08:06.719 --> 08:11.349
It's been grooming week. We've been
cutting, clipping, moussing and foaming.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.756
Now we tackle
the mother of all problems,

08:13.826 --> 08:16.056
removal of unwanted facial hair.

08:16.128 --> 08:17.220
That's right.

08:17.296 --> 08:21.392
Every little boy remembers peering over
the sink watching his father shaving.

08:21.467 --> 08:24.436
In your case it was your mom, wasrt it?

08:24.504 --> 08:28.235
"Al, stop staring at me!
Get me another beer, will ya?!"

08:28.307 --> 08:29.604
Tim?

08:29.675 --> 08:32.235
Shaving equipment has come
a long way over the years.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.041
Right. Today we have
a lot of things to choose from.

08:35.114 --> 08:39.642
Double-edged, swivel head, disposable,
and a wide array of electric shavers.

08:39.719 --> 08:43.155
But for the purist, nothing beats
the cut of a straight edge.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.156
- Right, Al?
- That's right.

08:45.224 --> 08:48.591
Look out! My thumb!
Oh, my God! Just kidding.

08:48.694 --> 08:53.654
Today we're gonna show how close it
shaves by shaving Al's beard. Right, Al?

08:53.733 --> 08:55.894
I don't think so, Tim.

08:56.969 --> 08:59.733
I've grown rather fond of this beard.

08:59.805 --> 09:02.569
You call it a beard.
I call it a runway for Fritos.

09:03.776 --> 09:05.937
In barber college
they practice on a balloon

09:06.012 --> 09:08.776
to get a handle on a straight edge
so they don't nick their customers.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.849
I've got my own version of the balloon.

09:13.553 --> 09:17.216
Why do you put my face on everything
you're about to mangle or destroy?

09:18.824 --> 09:21.156
Because your butt won't fit.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.822
Why don't we take
some audience questions

09:25.898 --> 09:29.925
while Tim lathers up
this ruggedly handsome balloon?

09:30.002 --> 09:33.369
All right, any questions?
Yes, sir?

09:33.472 --> 09:36.100
No matter what kind of razor I use,
I cut myself.

09:36.175 --> 09:38.268
What do you recommend
to stop the bleeding?

09:38.344 --> 09:40.904
Grow a beard.

09:42.114 --> 09:44.241
I recommend a styptic pencil.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.875
Don't use toilet paper.

09:45.952 --> 09:49.285
Otherwise, you have squares over
your face with the red dots in them.

09:49.355 --> 09:52.916
Looks like your face is covered
with little Japanese flags.

09:52.992 --> 09:55.290
Very embarrassing down at the VFW Hall.

09:55.361 --> 09:58.524
All right. Um, well, why don't we...
Heidi, some more questions?

09:58.631 --> 10:00.656
OK. Who else has a question?

10:00.733 --> 10:02.462
Yes, Brad?

10:02.535 --> 10:06.972
Ladies and gentlemen, this handsome
young man is Tim's oldest son, Brad.

10:11.677 --> 10:15.738
Uh, yes. I'm a twice-a-week shaver with
a pretty light beard. What should I use?

10:15.815 --> 10:18.375
A big brown crayon.

10:19.518 --> 10:21.611
Brad, introduce us to your friend there.

10:21.687 --> 10:24.451
Oh, I'd love to.
This is Samantha Hayes.

10:24.523 --> 10:27.014
She's a communications major
at Wayne State

10:27.093 --> 10:29.618
and she plans to be a sportscaster.

10:29.695 --> 10:32.220
Is she your girlfriend, Brad?

10:32.298 --> 10:36.166
Well, actually, as of today,
this is my fiancée.

10:37.269 --> 10:39.703
Fiancée?

10:39.772 --> 10:42.900
Well, yes.
We just decided to get married.

10:54.253 --> 10:56.346
Why were you joking
about getting married?

10:56.422 --> 10:58.447
I was trying to do a serious show.

10:58.524 --> 11:01.584
Dad, I'm not joking.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.221
Samantha and I
put a lot of thought into this.

11:04.296 --> 11:07.629
You can't. You've only been
seeing each other for a month.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.760
Mr. Taylor, I know it seems fast, but...

11:10.836 --> 11:12.861
...Brad and I clicked
from the beginning.

11:12.938 --> 11:16.704
Put your clickers away.
This is ridiculous, guys.

11:16.809 --> 11:21.041
I knew you were gonna react like this.
You should be congratulating us.

11:21.113 --> 11:24.810
Waiter, get me some champagne. And
two juice boxes for the bride and groom!

11:26.619 --> 11:30.953
It doesn't matter what you say. We're
getting married. Let's get out of here.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.355
Brad... Hey! Hey!

11:33.426 --> 11:35.986
You can't get married!
You got homework!

11:39.131 --> 11:42.396
Mark, have you seen the salad spinner?
I can't find it anywhere.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.766
Yeah. I put it in
the dishwasher last night.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.805
Oh, no.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.933
It's genetic.

11:53.746 --> 11:55.179
Hi.

11:55.247 --> 11:58.808
Hi. One of our sons
is now melting plasticware.

11:58.918 --> 12:01.887
Well, another one of our sons
might be registering for it.

12:01.987 --> 12:04.285
What does that mean?

12:04.356 --> 12:06.415
Brad and Samantha want to get married.

12:06.492 --> 12:08.460
Married? That's insane!

12:08.561 --> 12:11.325
It's sad, really. Can I have his room?

12:12.198 --> 12:14.826
Would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

12:17.036 --> 12:20.733
<i>Listen to this. They announced
their engagement on Tool Time.</i>

12:20.806 --> 12:23.866
I tried to talk to him about it.
He just ran out on me.

12:23.943 --> 12:26.275
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What if she's pregnant?

12:27.580 --> 12:30.913
What if they're getting married
because they want to get pregnant?

12:30.983 --> 12:34.441
She probably just wants
to get a hold of the Taylor fortune.

12:36.088 --> 12:40.115
- There is no Taylor fortune.
- Not in cash. But we are tool rich.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.888
- We've got to stop this.
- We gotta stop it.

12:44.964 --> 12:46.591
- We can't panic.
- Can't panic.

12:46.665 --> 12:49.225
We've gotta be diplomatic
so we don't alienate Brad.

12:49.301 --> 12:51.735
We don't want Brad as an alien.

12:52.805 --> 12:55.672
- Oh, uh, hi, Brad. Hi.
- Hi, Brad.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.605
- I'll be up in my room studying.
- Fair enough.

12:58.677 --> 13:01.043
That was good.
That was calm. That was good.

13:01.113 --> 13:05.015
Are you insane? What is the matter with
you? You're acting like a crazy person!

13:05.084 --> 13:08.247
How could you even think
about getting married at your age?

13:08.354 --> 13:11.881
Mom, Samantha and I love each other
and we want to build a life together.

13:11.957 --> 13:15.620
Better build a small one. Not much room
up in that bedroom of yours, is there?

13:16.662 --> 13:20.621
Ever since I told you about this,
all you've been doing is joking around.

13:20.699 --> 13:24.965
When exactly do you plan
to have this wedding?

13:25.037 --> 13:27.471
We might not have the wedding.
We might elope.

13:27.540 --> 13:31.442
Just tell me, is Samantha pregnant?

13:31.510 --> 13:33.637
No, Mom. She's not pregnant.

13:33.712 --> 13:36.180
Are you getting married
just so you can have sex?

13:36.248 --> 13:39.945
What is with you, Mom?
All you think about is sex!

13:50.429 --> 13:51.794
What are you doing?

13:51.864 --> 13:54.424
Oh, I was just staring at the stars,

13:54.500 --> 13:56.593
trying to figure out
what it's all about.

13:56.669 --> 14:00.196
- Yeah? What did you find out?
- Teenagers are nuts.

14:01.674 --> 14:05.201
And Oriors belt
actually has some tools in it.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.839
- Hi-ho, good neighbors.
- Hi, Wilson.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.440
Pondering a distant galaxy?

14:12.518 --> 14:15.976
Actually, we're wishing
that we were up there.

14:16.055 --> 14:19.752
- Having a little problem with Brad.
- He's not eating his veggies.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.793
No... gettir married.

14:23.062 --> 14:26.122
Married? At Brad's age?

14:26.198 --> 14:29.258
He'll have to sit at the childrers
table at his own wedding.

14:30.870 --> 14:35.534
We know he's obviously too young for
this, but we can't get through to him.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.577
And the more we argue with him,
the farther away it drives him.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.577
Maybe you shouldn't argue so much.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.409
Great, just let him ruin his life?

14:42.481 --> 14:43.709
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

14:43.782 --> 14:46.751
The 19th century English novelist
Elizabeth Gaskell said,

14:46.852 --> 14:49.878
"The wise parent nurtures
the desire for independence

14:49.955 --> 14:54.483
in order to become a friend and advisor
when his absolute power ceases."

14:54.560 --> 14:57.893
If an English novelist said that,
how come it's not in English?

14:59.565 --> 15:04.628
He means if we expect Brad to listen
to us we've got to be on his side.

15:04.703 --> 15:07.672
- But we're not on his side, honey.
- It's reverse psychology.

15:07.773 --> 15:09.035
We have to pretend we are.

15:09.108 --> 15:12.771
Well, that isn't the most honest
interpretation of Miss Gaskell's words.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.313
She won't complain.
She's been dead 100 years.

15:15.381 --> 15:18.680
Show a little respect.
That's Eddie Haskell's mom, right?

15:27.993 --> 15:30.621
- Here comes the groom.
- Shut up.

15:31.730 --> 15:35.564
Hey, Brad, we were thinking about
places to have your bachelor party.

15:35.634 --> 15:38.262
How do you feel about Chuck E. Cheese?

15:45.110 --> 15:47.977
Yeah. The groom gets free tokens.

15:49.515 --> 15:52.973
I get enough crap from Mom and Dad.
I'm not taking it from you guys.

15:53.052 --> 15:55.748
Oh, good, Brad, you're here.
We want to talk to you.

15:55.821 --> 15:58.790
Oh, I am so glad I'm not you right now.

16:00.192 --> 16:02.888
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Now, wait, wait.

16:02.962 --> 16:07.126
Look, we overreacted about this Samantha
thing. We want to make it up to you.

16:07.199 --> 16:10.066
We've been thinking,
we'd like to have her over for dinner.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.365
Why?

16:12.438 --> 16:15.999
Well, if you're this serious about her,
we should get to know her better.

16:17.176 --> 16:19.201
- So, you guys mean it?
- Yeah, absolutely.

16:19.278 --> 16:20.973
I want to make it really special.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.606
- What's her favorite dish?
- Anything.

16:23.682 --> 16:26.810
Chicken Cordon Bleu
with endive watercress salad.

16:27.853 --> 16:29.821
We'll go with your favorite dish.

16:29.888 --> 16:32.448
Sloppy Joes and Tater Tots?

16:35.494 --> 16:37.758
Mrs. Taylor, you cooked
a delicious dinner.

16:37.830 --> 16:42.199
If you're gonna be
part of the family, you gotta be honest.

16:42.301 --> 16:45.634
OK. The brown stuff is a little salty.

16:46.238 --> 16:49.605
Roll it around in the green stuff.
It'll slide right down.

16:51.410 --> 16:53.970
I'm glad you guys
are positive about our engagement.

16:54.046 --> 16:57.072
- It's important to us.
- They had a little trouble at first.

16:57.149 --> 17:00.448
But then they realized how committed
we are and they came around.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.044
- It's good for us, too.
- Oh, what do you mean?

17:03.122 --> 17:06.454
We've been real worried about
putting three boys through college.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.358
And now we just have to worry
about Mark and Randy.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.262
Why, I still want to go to college.

17:13.332 --> 17:17.098
Oh, sure, honey. But, you know,
you're gonna be married and on your own.

17:17.202 --> 17:20.137
So, you have to pay for it yourself.

17:20.204 --> 17:23.971
All right, that's fine. I mean,
I'll probably get a scholarship anyway.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.704
If you don't, I'll get a job
when I graduate next year.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.407
- I'll pay your tuition.
- No, you shouldn't do that.

17:29.481 --> 17:32.041
If that happens,
I just won't go to college.

17:32.117 --> 17:35.883
Brad, I don't want our children to have
a father who never went to college.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.151
Children?

17:41.260 --> 17:43.490
Oh, yeah. Children. Mmm.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.792
Have you decided how many
you want to have?

17:45.864 --> 17:49.732
I am very excited
about the idea of grandchildren.

17:49.802 --> 17:52.532
- Oh, I'd like one of each.
- How about you, Brad?

17:52.604 --> 17:54.572
Children?

17:54.673 --> 17:56.573
Sure. You're gonna love them,

17:56.642 --> 18:00.601
coming home to their chubby little faces
after a long night of delivering pizzas.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.709
So, what makes you think
I'll be delivering pizzas?

18:06.819 --> 18:09.151
I'll still work
at the sporting goods store.

18:09.221 --> 18:13.385
Oh. Well, yeah. But, you're gonna
need a second job to support the kids.

18:13.459 --> 18:17.020
OK. I see what you're doing here.
You're trying to scare us.

18:17.129 --> 18:20.360
- It's not going to work.
- If your parents are having a problem,

18:20.432 --> 18:23.128
- we should talk this out.
- No, I'm through talking.

18:23.202 --> 18:26.694
I talked to them. They said they
were supportive. It was just an act.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.467
Let's get out of here.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.236
Well, thanks for dinner.

18:31.310 --> 18:34.211
It was... OK.

18:38.917 --> 18:40.646
Well, that went well.

18:41.553 --> 18:44.386
Did you see Brad's face
when he heard the word "children"?

18:44.456 --> 18:47.425
- I think we had a real effect on them.
- Maybe.

18:47.526 --> 18:50.495
Or they could be headed
across the state line to get married.

18:50.562 --> 18:52.462
Congratulations, Granny.

18:56.168 --> 18:59.194
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

18:59.271 --> 19:00.397
It's OK.

19:00.472 --> 19:04.033
My parents are gonna go ballistic
when I tell them we're getting married.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.111
You haven't told them yet?

19:06.211 --> 19:09.544
No. I wanted to wait
until they made my next car payment.

19:12.384 --> 19:15.615
Yeah. Well, at least we know
we're doing the right thing, right?

19:15.687 --> 19:19.350
- That's right.
- Marriage is gonna be great.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.653
Yeah, great.

19:24.730 --> 19:27.358
How soon were you planning
on having children?

19:29.101 --> 19:31.433
Well, not right away.

19:32.070 --> 19:34.766
I was thinking of waiting a few years.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.172
Five... ten.

19:37.442 --> 19:41.310
- Is that too long for you?
- No, no. I was thinking like 15, 20.

19:43.148 --> 19:45.810
Brad, do you really think
you're ready to get married?

19:45.884 --> 19:48.148
Well, I don't know.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.454
I mean, how do you feel?

19:52.157 --> 19:54.318
I think we should slow down a little.

19:55.160 --> 19:59.529
Man,
I'm glad to hear you say that.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.828
And as much as I like you,

20:01.900 --> 20:05.859
I mean, it would be kind of weird
taking my report card home to my wife.

20:11.643 --> 20:14.305
I need more plasticware
for these leftovers.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.814
Oh, man!

20:22.254 --> 20:25.417
- Brad?
- Listen, before you guys say anything,

20:25.524 --> 20:30.052
- there's something I want to tell you.
- You want to register at Toys 'R' Us?

20:35.300 --> 20:39.236
No. Samantha and I decided not to follow
through on this whole marriage thing.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.431
Really? How come?

20:41.506 --> 20:45.237
Lots of reasons. But none of this had
anything to do with what you guys said.

20:45.310 --> 20:48.609
- No. Of course not.
- You're old enough to make decisions.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.511
That's right.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.845
- Goodnight.
- 'Night.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.477
Goodnight, honey.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.019
Yes!

20:59.424 --> 21:01.585
No wedding.
This calls for a celebration.

21:01.693 --> 21:07.063
This proves that we can deal
with any crisis that comes our way.

21:08.033 --> 21:10.934
Here's to two parents
that can handle anything.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.236
I'm going out.
I'll be back about 9:00.

21:26.852 --> 21:28.979
Was his hair pink?

21:30.922 --> 21:32.651
Fuchsia.

21:37.362 --> 21:41.298
What we're gonna do is, I'm gonna use
this practice balloon sent over by

21:41.366 --> 21:43.459
the Straub Barber College.

21:43.835 --> 21:44.961
Hey!

21:45.037 --> 21:47.164
I don't go
for that sort of thing!

21:53.211 --> 21:55.372
I don't go for that sort of thing.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.778
You scared the out of me.

21:57.949 --> 22:00.975
- I don't like to be scared.
- I don't like to be scared.
