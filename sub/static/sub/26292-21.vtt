00:24.549 --> 00:26.617
- Looking great.
- Mm.

00:26.652 --> 00:29.587
Yeah, well, the secret is, uh...

00:29.621 --> 00:32.023
night sweats with aggressive vomiting.

00:32.057 --> 00:35.375
Dose-dense treatment's a bear, yes.

00:36.334 --> 00:38.763
But you can't knock these results.

00:38.797 --> 00:39.897
Hit me, coach.

00:39.932 --> 00:43.234
Your tumor is regressing,
your polymorphonuclear cells

00:43.268 --> 00:45.536
are over 1,000
for the first time in a week,

00:45.570 --> 00:48.739
and your hemoglobin's
in the normal range.

00:50.282 --> 00:52.117
I'd stand and cheer but, uh,

00:52.151 --> 00:55.253
I think I'd, you know, fall over.

00:55.287 --> 00:57.222
Max, you should feel good about this.

00:57.256 --> 00:58.790
Well, yeah. No, I do, I do.

00:58.824 --> 01:00.125
I just didn't know that feeling this good

01:00.159 --> 01:02.110
would feel quite this bad.

01:04.738 --> 01:06.164
Uh, Virginia?

01:06.198 --> 01:08.992
I'm, uh, cold all the time.

01:09.026 --> 01:10.068
Is that...

01:10.102 --> 01:11.436
Common side effect.

01:14.106 --> 01:15.273
Here.

01:15.307 --> 01:17.442
And we'll hook you up to some fluids.

01:17.476 --> 01:20.445
This is all good news.
The chemo is working.

01:36.295 --> 01:38.563
Here looks good.

01:46.906 --> 01:49.340
Sir, do you know what floor
your room is on?

01:49.375 --> 01:51.243
I can call someone to get help.

01:52.144 --> 01:53.620
Oh.

01:54.413 --> 01:56.114
Sorry, Dr. Goodwin.

01:56.748 --> 01:58.116
I didn't recognize you.

02:08.561 --> 02:10.527

02:10.562 --> 02:13.131

02:13.165 --> 02:15.033

02:17.236 --> 02:18.570
we will look back and cringe

02:18.604 --> 02:20.305
at the barbarism of today's approach.

02:20.339 --> 02:22.507
And immunotherapy is one
of these new techniques.

02:22.541 --> 02:24.309
- I think it will be.
- But when?

02:24.343 --> 02:27.045
Cancer patients need
effective treatments now.

02:27.079 --> 02:28.479
How much of the cancer population

02:28.514 --> 02:30.315
are your therapies
actually helping... 1%?

02:30.349 --> 02:31.816
- More like 5%...
- Ah.

02:31.850 --> 02:33.318
But some clinicians
are doing even better...

02:33.352 --> 02:35.353
like Dr. Valentina Castro.

02:35.387 --> 02:37.188
She even practiced at New Amsterdam

02:37.223 --> 02:39.524
before Dr. Sharpe doubled down
on older treatments...

02:39.558 --> 02:42.360
- Because they worked.
- And forced Dr. Castro out.

02:42.394 --> 02:44.495
- Because hers didn't.
- Dr. Helen...

02:44.530 --> 02:46.431
- Dr. Sharpe, please.
- Dr. Sharpe.

02:46.465 --> 02:49.133
Can you tell us how you
view Dr. Panthaki's methods?

02:50.787 --> 02:52.103
With pleasure.

02:54.206 --> 02:56.007
I can't believe how much I missed that.

02:56.041 --> 02:57.275
It used to be such a big part of my life.

02:57.309 --> 02:58.610
It was my life.

02:58.644 --> 03:00.245
You should come to Brussels with me.

03:00.279 --> 03:02.280
What, now? 'Cause I... kinda thought

03:02.314 --> 03:03.915
we were in the middle of something.

03:03.949 --> 03:05.550
Well, next week
I'm presenting at a conference,

03:05.584 --> 03:08.253
but you should be up there with me.

03:08.287 --> 03:10.021
- Presenting?
- Doing

03:10.055 --> 03:12.090
what we just did in that studio...

03:12.124 --> 03:15.126
Debating.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.895
More like wiping the floor with you.

03:17.930 --> 03:20.131
Pretty sure I just
eviscerated your life's work

03:20.165 --> 03:22.400
with my life's work.

03:27.072 --> 03:29.207
Then I challenge you to a rematch.

03:29.241 --> 03:30.621
In Brussels.

03:34.079 --> 03:37.248
As long as we get
to keep making out like this.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.218
Luke Bauer, previously
healthy 17-year-old,

03:40.252 --> 03:41.486
status: post fall.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.920
Now complaining of left arm weakness

03:42.955 --> 03:44.922
and blurred vision.
Normal and stable heart rate and BP.

03:44.957 --> 03:47.392
- Take him to trauma one?
- Tell me which came first:

03:47.426 --> 03:49.060
the blurred vision or the fall?

03:49.094 --> 03:50.495
Uh, I tripped because I couldn't see.

03:50.529 --> 03:51.616
Take him to curtains.

03:51.650 --> 03:52.664
We're gonna take good care of you, Luke.

03:52.698 --> 03:54.032
All right, let's go.

03:54.967 --> 03:56.968
Yesterday I was handing out flyers,

03:57.002 --> 03:59.070
but I kept dropping 'em.

03:59.104 --> 04:01.339
Thought maybe I was just
hungry, so I got a hotdog.

04:01.373 --> 04:03.608
Took one bite, and I started choking.

04:03.642 --> 04:05.076
You know, I could barely swallow.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.011
After I woke up,
everything looked blurry,

04:07.046 --> 04:09.113
and that's when I tripped and fell.

04:09.148 --> 04:10.348
Botulism.

04:10.382 --> 04:12.583
- Back off, dude!
- Sorry, uh...

04:12.618 --> 04:16.019
Max Goodwin.
I'm the, uh, medical director.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.656
Just grabbing a quick
thirst-quenching beverage.

04:18.690 --> 04:21.326
Uh, all the symptoms
that you are experiencing

04:21.360 --> 04:24.429
are from a toxin produced
by the botulism bacteria

04:24.463 --> 04:26.364
that is growing
somewhere inside your body.

04:26.398 --> 04:27.665
Wow.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.168
Who knew talking could be this tiring?

04:30.202 --> 04:33.137
That adds up. I'll order the antitoxin.

04:33.172 --> 04:35.606
Yeah, I'll take care of him.

04:35.641 --> 04:37.659
Who's gonna take care of you?

04:40.479 --> 04:42.513
You're welcome to have a look yourself,

04:42.548 --> 04:44.682
but the concerns are pretty clear.

04:45.166 --> 04:48.005
You're being accused of forming
a non therapeutic alliance

04:48.039 --> 04:49.653
with your patient, Avi Mantell.

04:49.687 --> 04:51.556
- Yeah.
- As Deputy Medical Director,

04:51.590 --> 04:53.458
all personnel complaints come to my desk,

04:53.492 --> 04:55.393
so I'll be conducting the initial review.

04:55.427 --> 04:57.662
Okay. And after that?

04:58.497 --> 05:00.665
Let's hope there
isn't anything after that.

05:00.699 --> 05:03.634
Yeah, okay. I trust the process.

05:03.669 --> 05:05.536
I, uh, pulled all the case files

05:05.571 --> 05:07.071
and therapy notes for Avi.

05:07.106 --> 05:08.373
Everything's there.

05:08.407 --> 05:10.007
- Great, thank you.
- Yeah, you got it.

05:10.042 --> 05:11.568
We'll talk soon.

05:12.277 --> 05:14.679
Helen, hey, hey.

05:14.713 --> 05:16.247
I didn't, uh, you know...

05:16.281 --> 05:19.317
I mean, I didn't
do anything wrong, right?

05:21.453 --> 05:23.079
We'll talk soon.

05:23.522 --> 05:25.356
Okay.

05:27.693 --> 05:29.660
What's wrong with you?

05:29.695 --> 05:31.396
Uh, throat cancer.

05:31.430 --> 05:33.064
That sucks.

05:33.098 --> 05:34.591
Really does.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.535
Oh, here we go.

05:37.569 --> 05:41.105
Cellulitis. This is where
the botulism bacteria is.

05:41.140 --> 05:43.508
Growing in this cut is how
it got under your skin.

05:43.542 --> 05:44.893
How'd you get this?

05:45.377 --> 05:48.679
Uh, I was dumpster diving
a couple weeks back,

05:48.714 --> 05:52.683
and let's just say my execution
wasn't a perfect ten.

05:52.718 --> 05:53.846
I see that.

05:53.881 --> 05:55.353
Hey, what... what are you doing?

05:55.387 --> 05:57.422
I'm just outlining the infection

05:57.456 --> 06:00.691
so that we can track
its, uh, progression...

06:00.726 --> 06:03.194
or hopefully lack thereof.

06:03.228 --> 06:05.330
Why didn't you come in sooner?

06:06.565 --> 06:08.800
Don't have insurance.

06:08.834 --> 06:10.535
That shouldn't have stopped you.

06:10.569 --> 06:11.632
Come on, you know how it works.

06:11.666 --> 06:14.272
You walk up to the desk,
they ask you for a card.

06:14.306 --> 06:16.607
Without one, no one even looks at you.

06:16.642 --> 06:18.676
It's embarrassing.

06:19.511 --> 06:22.023
Being invisible is almost
worse than being sick.

06:25.484 --> 06:28.219
Did you know Luke's had
that infection for two weeks?

06:28.253 --> 06:29.420
Not surprised.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.756
Back then it could have been
treated in a clinic, you know?

06:31.790 --> 06:34.125
A few stitches, some antibiotics.

06:34.159 --> 06:36.294
Cheap fix. But instead, he waited.

06:36.328 --> 06:38.729
He ended up much sicker and in the E.D.

06:38.764 --> 06:41.499
with inefficient, complex,
and very expensive care.

06:41.533 --> 06:43.234
All solid points I'd love to discuss

06:43.268 --> 06:44.635
when I'm not slammed.

06:44.670 --> 06:45.770
All because he didn't have insurance.

06:45.804 --> 06:49.106
I bet half the people in this
E.D. don't have insurance.

06:49.141 --> 06:51.108
Probably more than half,
but there's nothing we can do.

06:51.143 --> 06:52.243
You know what, there is.

06:52.277 --> 06:53.644
There is something that we can do.

06:53.679 --> 06:55.680
We can get every hospital administrator

06:55.714 --> 06:57.415
down here right now.

06:57.449 --> 06:59.250
Why would I do that?

06:59.284 --> 07:01.285
So they can enroll everyone
in a proper insurance plan.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.588
This is what the ACA set out to do...

07:03.622 --> 07:05.156
to give everyone access

07:05.190 --> 07:06.691
to health insurance they can afford.

07:06.725 --> 07:09.293
- Isn't that... complicated?
- Yes.

07:09.328 --> 07:10.428
Very.

07:10.462 --> 07:12.830
But it's hurting our patients,
and it's costing us money,

07:12.865 --> 07:15.099
and this could maybe fix both.

07:15.133 --> 07:18.603
Health insurance
is available to these people,

07:18.637 --> 07:21.639
and we're gonna get each
and every one of them enrolled.

07:32.251 --> 07:33.651
This is Dr. Helen Sharpe,

07:33.685 --> 07:35.353
Deputy Head of Medicine at New Amsterdam,

07:35.387 --> 07:37.455
presiding over an internal investigation

07:37.489 --> 07:39.457
into Dr. Ignatius Frome.

07:39.491 --> 07:41.559
Also present is Ms. Tiara Dobbs.

07:41.593 --> 07:43.794
This inquiry alleges that you, Dr. Frome,

07:43.829 --> 07:46.797
violated hospital policy ADMN #23.

07:46.832 --> 07:49.634
This policy addresses
non therapeutic relationships,

07:49.668 --> 07:52.470
including ones where members
of staff are overly invested

07:52.504 --> 07:54.472
in a child or family's care.

07:54.506 --> 07:57.875
I... I've always tried to
provide the best care possible.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.744
Your intentions aren't in question.

07:59.778 --> 08:01.812
Oh, good.

08:01.847 --> 08:03.514
Your methods are.

08:05.350 --> 08:07.318
Have you ever shown favoritism

08:07.352 --> 08:08.653
towards a particular patient?

08:08.687 --> 08:09.871
No.

08:10.923 --> 08:13.858
You've never bought gifts for a patient?

08:13.892 --> 08:18.296
Um, birthdays, maybe. Yeah.

08:18.931 --> 08:21.599
And... and sometimes
I might see a little something

08:21.633 --> 08:23.601
that I know a kid
would respond to really well

08:23.635 --> 08:25.503
or like in particular.

08:25.537 --> 08:30.775
Uh, but I wouldn't, uh,
I wouldn't call it favoritism.

08:30.809 --> 08:32.743
So your answer is yes.

08:33.186 --> 08:34.879
Yes.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.215
Have you ever brought special food

08:38.250 --> 08:39.683
into the hospital for patients?

08:39.717 --> 08:41.402
Uh-uh, no.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.422
W-uh, wait, yes.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.292
But the... the patient
specifically mentioned s'mores

08:48.327 --> 08:49.860
in session, so...

08:49.895 --> 08:51.896
- That's a yes also.
- Yes.

08:51.930 --> 08:54.699
But w-we all go
the extra mile around here.

08:54.733 --> 08:58.336
This inquiry isn't about
everyone else, Dr. Frome.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.376
It's about you.

09:05.577 --> 09:07.645
Have you ever initiated

09:07.679 --> 09:09.973
uninvited physical contact?

09:10.974 --> 09:13.618
I've never made anyone uncomfortable,

09:13.652 --> 09:15.103
if that's what you mean.

09:15.854 --> 09:17.888
That isn't a no.

09:20.492 --> 09:23.461
Dr. Frome, have you ever hugged,

09:23.495 --> 09:26.664
kissed, or otherwise touched
a patient without invitation?

09:26.698 --> 09:28.866
No, I have never...

09:29.668 --> 09:31.494
kissed a patient.

09:32.504 --> 09:35.473
Have you ever hugged or touched a patient

09:35.507 --> 09:37.026
without invitation?

09:46.618 --> 09:47.885
Yes.

09:50.656 --> 09:52.657
And you understand...

09:52.691 --> 09:54.458
that that is outside the bounds

09:54.493 --> 09:57.728
of a normal therapeutic relationship?

09:59.865 --> 10:01.149
Yes.

10:09.908 --> 10:12.910
I'm looking for my consult,
a seizure patient.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.580
- Feng Shen?
- Follow the noise.

10:20.352 --> 10:22.053
Please, Feng is very sick.

10:22.087 --> 10:23.921
He needs you!

10:23.956 --> 10:25.556
Yes, yes.

10:25.591 --> 10:27.258
I see.

10:27.292 --> 10:29.127
Excuse me.

10:33.765 --> 10:35.566
Hello, Feng.

10:35.601 --> 10:37.702
I'm Dr. Kapoor.

10:44.276 --> 10:46.577
Has Feng lost weight recently?

10:51.450 --> 10:53.584
- One at a time.
- Yes.

11:00.459 --> 11:03.094
Feng does not want to eat.

11:03.128 --> 11:04.629
Not at all.

11:06.064 --> 11:08.674
Prep Feng for
a lumbar puncture right away.

11:14.506 --> 11:16.974
You are staring awfully hard
at that screen.

11:18.043 --> 11:19.644
Yeah, this might be
an awkward time to tell you,

11:19.678 --> 11:23.147
but I'm in love with
coronary artery bypass surgery.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.449
- Mm-hmm.
- What are you doing out here?

11:25.484 --> 11:27.718
Uh, I was actually trying to see you.

11:27.753 --> 11:30.221
Oh, that's cool.
I was on my way to see you.

11:30.255 --> 11:32.156
Oh, do tell.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.292
Well, I want you
to come to Sunday dinner.

11:34.326 --> 11:35.868
Meet my family.

11:37.663 --> 11:39.297
Or not?

11:39.331 --> 11:41.432
I was gonna surprise you,
but I got invited

11:41.466 --> 11:43.768
to this salon in Harlem
to see Ta-Nehisi Coates,

11:43.802 --> 11:45.469
and you were gonna be my plus-one.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.104
- No way.
- Yes!

11:47.139 --> 11:48.973
- Oh, you know that's my boy.
- I know!

11:49.007 --> 11:50.007
That's why I was so excited.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.577
But I can meet your family
next Sunday, right?

11:52.611 --> 11:55.112
Oh, my mom will look at me sideways

11:55.147 --> 11:56.414
if I miss Sunday dinner,

11:56.448 --> 11:58.349
and then my sisters will pile on.

11:58.383 --> 12:00.935
So you've never missed a Sunday dinner?

12:01.320 --> 12:03.654
College.

12:03.689 --> 12:06.424
Then you deserve to have Ta-Nehisi

12:06.458 --> 12:09.026
sign your "Black Panther" comic.

12:10.028 --> 12:12.563
I do, don't I?

12:14.733 --> 12:16.100
I'm in.

12:16.134 --> 12:18.769
Yes!

12:22.241 --> 12:24.292
- Phone number?
- No phone.

12:25.043 --> 12:26.277
Address?

12:26.311 --> 12:28.646
Wherever we are right now.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.015
Do you have a PO box or something?

12:31.049 --> 12:34.018
Yeah, for all my Amazon deliveries.

12:34.052 --> 12:35.720
Oh, well, then I suppose there's no way

12:35.754 --> 12:39.190
to mail you your insurance card.

12:39.224 --> 12:41.025
Um...

12:41.059 --> 12:42.685
I'll be right back.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.696
Sorry to bother you, Dr. Goodwin.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.531
My patient doesn't have
a social security number,

12:47.566 --> 12:49.533
- and it's required for ACA.
- The family I just

12:49.568 --> 12:51.535
tried to sign up
all gave me the same name.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.704
- They're a family.
- The same first name.

12:53.739 --> 12:56.107
Okay, give me... give me a second.

12:57.442 --> 12:58.709
Curious: is this better

12:58.744 --> 12:59.901
or worse than what you had in mind?

12:59.935 --> 13:01.479
Luke Bauer's cellulitis has progressed

13:01.513 --> 13:03.047
to necrotizing fasciitis.

13:03.081 --> 13:05.216
He may have already seeded
his heart valves.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.417
I'll page Reynolds and book an O.R.

13:06.451 --> 13:08.319
- Okay. Hmm?
- Dr. Goodwin.

13:08.353 --> 13:09.854
I can't tell if my patient is a good fit

13:09.888 --> 13:10.964
for this insurance plan

13:10.999 --> 13:13.557
because I can't decipher the plan myself.

13:15.727 --> 13:17.728
I've gotta hand it to you, boss.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.864
You have outdone yourself this time.

13:19.898 --> 13:21.666
- Did I?
- The entire hospital...

13:21.700 --> 13:23.701
and I mean the entire hospital...

13:23.735 --> 13:25.736
have been talking about your insane plan

13:25.771 --> 13:28.739
to sign every single patient up
for health insurance.

13:28.774 --> 13:31.175
Uh, seriously, what were you thinking?

13:31.209 --> 13:32.777
Max? Max!

13:32.811 --> 13:34.679
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

13:34.713 --> 13:36.580
You want me to have someone
bring you up a wheelchair?

13:36.615 --> 13:38.416
No, no, I'm totally good.

13:38.450 --> 13:41.585
I'm just... much slower.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.521
You got lapped by a 92-year-old

13:43.555 --> 13:44.889
- with a walker.
- Ouch.

13:44.923 --> 13:46.357
But you're not wrong.

13:46.391 --> 13:49.360
The, um, insurance thing was flawed,

13:49.394 --> 13:51.429
but you, uh, know why?

13:51.463 --> 13:53.097
Um, it's hard to narrow down

13:53.131 --> 13:54.765
exactly which joke to make here.

13:54.800 --> 13:55.967
This is a public hospital, right?

13:56.001 --> 13:58.569
Our help is free to the public.
That's the whole thing.

13:58.603 --> 14:00.638
People don't need insurance
to be treated here,

14:00.672 --> 14:03.641
and most people right now
don't know that.

14:03.675 --> 14:05.810
And how do you expect
to fix that problem?

14:05.844 --> 14:08.212
Um, let me see this.

14:17.456 --> 14:19.790
Now, look.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.892
This is how we fix it.

14:23.628 --> 14:25.463
And what exactly is included

14:25.497 --> 14:27.498
in the New Amsterdam Family Plan?

14:27.532 --> 14:30.434
Um, just about everything.

14:30.469 --> 14:32.737
And how much will people pay for it?

14:32.771 --> 14:34.638
- Kinda like nothing.
- Yeah?

14:34.673 --> 14:36.807
- That's what I thought.
- Yeah, I'm gonna need copies.

14:36.842 --> 14:39.143
Maybe... what do you think,
500,000 to start?

14:39.177 --> 14:40.177
Yeah, sure.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.680
And then what?
We hide them in chocolate bars?

14:42.714 --> 14:43.948
No, I was thinking we might hand them out

14:43.982 --> 14:46.150
to every resident of New York City.

14:50.856 --> 14:52.790
Have you and Dr. Frome ever been alone

14:52.824 --> 14:54.825
in the same room together?

14:54.860 --> 14:57.161
Yeah, during session.

14:57.195 --> 14:59.764
And during session...

14:59.798 --> 15:03.701
has Dr. Frome ever initiated
physical contact?

15:04.302 --> 15:05.770
Why are we talking about this?

15:07.706 --> 15:10.541
Ms. Dobbs told me
that she witnessed Dr. Frome

15:10.575 --> 15:13.444
touch you on your head, neck, and face.

15:14.546 --> 15:15.915
It's okay.

15:19.317 --> 15:22.319
Like, a hand on my shoulder, I guess.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.221
Or on my knee sometimes.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.956
How did it make you feel?

15:27.759 --> 15:29.293
This is stupid.

15:29.327 --> 15:31.295
I'm sorry.

15:31.329 --> 15:34.198
I am sorry, but it... it's important.

15:36.768 --> 15:38.836
How did it make you feel?

15:38.870 --> 15:41.305
I don't want to talk about that, okay?

15:41.339 --> 15:42.907
Does physical contact make you feel

15:42.941 --> 15:44.742
uncomfortable sometimes?

15:48.580 --> 15:49.680
Avi?

15:53.718 --> 15:56.387
Have you ever been
touched inappropriately

15:56.421 --> 15:58.756
by Dr. Frome or anyone else?

16:04.529 --> 16:05.841
Honey.

16:11.069 --> 16:13.145
I didn't know how to tell you.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.345
Avi, we're gonna protect you.

16:24.082 --> 16:26.028
Can you tell us who?

16:29.087 --> 16:31.330
I wanna talk to Dr. Frome.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.994
Injecting dye.

16:39.004 --> 16:40.998
Dye filling chamber.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.935
Right there. You see that, Max?

16:46.404 --> 16:48.739
Small vegetation
on Luke's bicuspid valve.

16:48.773 --> 16:50.441
<i>Got it.</i>

16:50.475 --> 16:52.610
<i>- You okay up there?
- Mm.</i>

16:52.644 --> 16:54.612
<i>Numbers never been better. Huh.</i>

16:54.646 --> 16:57.281
That's surprising, seeing as
you've never looked worse.

16:57.315 --> 16:59.917
- No offense.
<i>- None taken.</i>

16:59.951 --> 17:01.385
Dr. Reynolds?

17:01.419 --> 17:02.786
Dr. Kapoor's requesting a consult.

17:02.821 --> 17:04.555
Okay. I'm done here.

17:06.124 --> 17:07.992
Oh, Max?

17:08.026 --> 17:09.727
I took a look at Luke's calf.

17:09.761 --> 17:11.662
<i>The, uh, general surgeon's on the way.</i>

17:11.695 --> 17:13.497
<i>All right, tell them
he's been injecting heroin</i>

17:13.531 --> 17:14.964
<i>under the skin.</i>

17:15.000 --> 17:17.601
<i>He said he got it dumpster diving.</i>

17:17.636 --> 17:19.007
<i>Then he lied.</i>

17:26.778 --> 17:29.480
Pulmonary and meningeal tuberculosis.

17:29.514 --> 17:31.949
- Very troubling.
- Well, TB happens.

17:31.983 --> 17:34.418
We just gotta isolate the boy,
zap him with antibiotics,

17:34.452 --> 17:36.020
and Bob's your uncle.

17:36.054 --> 17:38.422
Yes, if only it was just Bob.

17:38.456 --> 17:41.458
Their entire family lives in
a multi-family home in Queens.

17:41.493 --> 17:43.827
I've asked them to come for testing.

17:49.868 --> 17:51.468
All of them.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.107
Iggy!

17:57.142 --> 17:58.809
You need to think about this.

17:58.843 --> 18:00.778
What's there to think about?
A patient asked to talk to me.

18:00.812 --> 18:02.364
He's no longer your patient.

18:02.399 --> 18:04.014
Well, those darn
doctor-patient boundaries.

18:04.049 --> 18:05.649
Famously a weakness of mine.

18:05.684 --> 18:07.017
There's been hearings about it
and everything.

18:07.052 --> 18:08.652
- You were there.
- Iggy, you are a kind man,

18:08.687 --> 18:09.653
but if you talk to this boy

18:09.688 --> 18:10.854
your kindness
is gonna be used against you.

18:10.889 --> 18:13.691
Every word you say is gonna be
placed under a microscope.

18:13.725 --> 18:15.289
I hear you. I understand,

18:15.324 --> 18:16.694
and I know you're trying to help me,

18:16.728 --> 18:17.728
but if I'm not there for my patients

18:17.762 --> 18:19.997
when they need me the most,
what am I doing here?

18:20.031 --> 18:22.032
Why even do this job at all?

18:22.067 --> 18:23.634
Avi has something to say to me,

18:23.668 --> 18:25.636
I'm going to listen,
no matter the consequence.

18:25.670 --> 18:26.804
- Iggy...
- That's it!

18:26.838 --> 18:28.072
End of story.

19:17.586 --> 19:21.055
Please, everyone, let's...
let's just stay calm, okay?

19:21.089 --> 19:23.224
TB is a very treatable disease.

19:23.258 --> 19:25.026
But when can they come home?

19:25.060 --> 19:26.394
TB likes to play hide-and-seek,

19:26.428 --> 19:28.729
so the process of eradicating the disease

19:28.764 --> 19:32.199
from the body can be lengthy.

19:32.234 --> 19:34.535
Ann and Feng will need to pass three

19:34.569 --> 19:36.437
negative sputum tests in a row.

19:36.471 --> 19:38.572
How long will that take?

19:40.475 --> 19:42.443
Three to nine months.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.641
<i>Surgery went well.</i>

19:46.676 --> 19:49.717
We managed to remove
all of the infection.

19:49.751 --> 19:51.619
Few weeks of pills and you should be...

19:51.947 --> 19:53.421
you should be fine.

19:53.455 --> 19:56.791
Um, this is...

19:56.825 --> 19:59.427
well, it's just like insurance.

19:59.461 --> 20:00.858
And you can use this

20:00.893 --> 20:03.731
to get, uh, follow-up care here
at New Amsterdam.

20:03.765 --> 20:05.332
You just walk up to any of these desks

20:05.367 --> 20:07.835
and you flash this baby, and...

20:08.172 --> 20:09.737
and they'll honor it.

20:09.771 --> 20:11.572
And they'll treat you with respect.

20:11.967 --> 20:13.307
And you won't get a bill.

20:13.341 --> 20:14.775
Seriously?

20:14.810 --> 20:16.138
Yeah.

20:17.179 --> 20:19.613
And you can use it also at, uh...

20:21.616 --> 20:24.098
- At one of our rehab clinics.
- What...

20:24.132 --> 20:25.519
And you should, Luke, because
what you're doing to yourself...

20:25.554 --> 20:27.288
- I knew it.
- Luke, I just...

20:27.322 --> 20:28.689
Just forget your stupid card.

20:28.723 --> 20:30.357
I'm not coming back here
so you can talk down to me,

20:30.392 --> 20:32.593
accuse me of things I didn't do.

20:32.627 --> 20:34.428
You're just like everyone else.

20:34.463 --> 20:36.697
- Wait...
- Just back off, okay?

20:44.372 --> 20:45.626
Hey.

20:46.308 --> 20:49.310
I know this is weird, but...
but it, um...

20:51.580 --> 20:53.481
This is a bad idea.

20:55.817 --> 20:57.304
You know what?

20:57.819 --> 21:00.554
This is unusual. I get it.

21:00.589 --> 21:02.356
Don't even look at them, all right?

21:02.390 --> 21:04.103
Just hang with me.

21:04.493 --> 21:06.814
It's just me and you, like always.

21:07.562 --> 21:10.231
Okay?

21:10.265 --> 21:12.800
What's up? How you feeling?

21:12.834 --> 21:14.535
Messed up.

21:14.569 --> 21:16.990
Okay, that's a good start.

21:18.033 --> 21:19.874
What's messed up?

21:19.908 --> 21:21.328
Like...

21:21.843 --> 21:24.456
they asked if... if you touched me.

21:24.998 --> 21:26.709
And... and you do, right?

21:28.419 --> 21:30.818
And that's, like, okay,

21:30.852 --> 21:32.887
because when you do,

21:33.132 --> 21:35.656
I feel loved or whatever.

21:35.690 --> 21:36.885
Good.

21:38.053 --> 21:39.972
But then it's like, what do I know?

21:40.723 --> 21:42.391
Because, you know...

21:43.365 --> 21:45.185
times in my past...

21:46.301 --> 21:49.064
before you, I, uh...

21:49.938 --> 21:51.672
Have you ever felt differently

21:51.706 --> 21:53.274
when someone else touched you?

21:53.308 --> 21:55.342
Well, n-no.

21:55.377 --> 21:57.545
I don't know...
that's what's so messed up.

21:57.579 --> 21:58.712
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

21:58.747 --> 22:00.848
It sounds confusing.

22:00.882 --> 22:03.537
Why... why don't we... Let's simplify.

22:04.204 --> 22:06.520
Where were you first time this happened?

22:06.555 --> 22:08.289
I was in Missouri.

22:08.917 --> 22:11.458
- Watching TV.
- What was on TV?

22:11.493 --> 22:14.195
- A soap.
- A soap?

22:14.229 --> 22:16.297
- She liked them.
- Okay.

22:16.759 --> 22:18.265
Tell me about her.

22:18.300 --> 22:21.602
She'd watch me while my mom was at work.

22:21.636 --> 22:23.404
You know, I'd sit on her lap

22:23.438 --> 22:26.707
and she'd scratch my back.

22:26.741 --> 22:27.944
Oh.

22:27.978 --> 22:30.811
And then one day...

22:30.845 --> 22:33.214
she asked if I...

22:33.248 --> 22:34.902
if I wanted to kiss.

22:35.417 --> 22:38.989
You know, like they did on the TV.

22:41.289 --> 22:42.957
And we did.

22:44.659 --> 22:47.761
And then she asked me
to lie on top of her.

22:49.631 --> 22:52.333
- How old were you?
- Five.

22:56.371 --> 22:57.771
That must have been really scary.

22:57.806 --> 23:00.641
It wasn't. She was nice to me.

23:02.277 --> 23:03.555
I just...

23:05.380 --> 23:06.767
I couldn't.

23:09.451 --> 23:10.918
You looked forward to it.

23:10.952 --> 23:12.753
I'm sick.

23:12.787 --> 23:14.755
- I'm disgusting.
- No, no.

23:14.789 --> 23:16.457
Avi, you are not disgusting.

23:16.491 --> 23:18.492
The only disgusting thing here is a woman

23:18.526 --> 23:21.782
in a position of power
taking advantage of a kid.

23:22.697 --> 23:24.243
Of a child.

23:26.635 --> 23:28.038
Not you.

23:33.341 --> 23:34.875
Why didn't you tell me?

23:35.262 --> 23:37.330
Why didn't you tell your mom?

23:39.481 --> 23:40.981
It's okay.

23:41.343 --> 23:42.816
You'll feel better if you say it.

23:46.821 --> 23:48.356
She's my aunt.

23:56.564 --> 23:58.966
Care to explain this latest scheme?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.702
Um, I wouldn't really call it a scheme.

24:01.736 --> 24:03.904
Uh, nothing on that card is a lie.

24:03.938 --> 24:06.473
We are a public hospital and, uh,

24:06.508 --> 24:08.475
we do treat everyone

24:08.510 --> 24:10.644
whether or not they have, uh, insurance.

24:10.679 --> 24:13.480
- So you're advertising.
- Yeah, exactly.

24:13.515 --> 24:15.382
I mean, do you know...
do you know how many people

24:15.417 --> 24:19.019
don't even know that they can
come to us for free?

24:19.054 --> 24:21.488
How many of these did you make?

24:21.758 --> 24:23.524
Um...

24:23.558 --> 24:25.359
I don't think you want to know that.

24:25.393 --> 24:27.928
If everyone in the city knew
they could just walk in here

24:27.962 --> 24:30.664
without insurance,
the whole system would crumble.

24:30.699 --> 24:31.899
Agree to disagree.

24:31.933 --> 24:33.834
I think the more patients
that we can help

24:33.868 --> 24:35.502
and the earlier we can help them,

24:35.537 --> 24:38.072
then the better the system will be.

24:38.106 --> 24:39.840
A public hospital only survives

24:39.874 --> 24:43.110
because so many people
don't realize they can use it.

24:43.144 --> 24:46.413
If everyone started coming
in here when they were sick,

24:46.448 --> 24:48.615
this hospital would run out of money.

24:48.650 --> 24:50.017
Well, good thing
I'm talking to the one person

24:50.051 --> 24:52.086
who can actually get us more funds.

24:52.120 --> 24:55.723
Are you trying to
singlehandedly socialize medicine?

24:55.757 --> 24:58.392
Public hospitals are socialized medicine.

24:58.426 --> 25:00.627
It already happened, it's already here,

25:00.662 --> 25:03.097
and it had nothing to do...

25:03.131 --> 25:05.065
with me.

25:05.100 --> 25:07.534
So why don't we just call some
things like we see it, right?

25:07.569 --> 25:10.537
The U.S. military... largest and
most funded socialist program

25:10.572 --> 25:11.572
in the entire world.

25:11.606 --> 25:13.941
We have public schools and...
and public libraries,

25:13.975 --> 25:16.477
and the police department
and the fire department.

25:16.511 --> 25:18.545
And we can all get behind
socialism there,

25:18.580 --> 25:21.715
but just not in our hospitals.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.984
Is this the hill you want to die on?

25:28.456 --> 25:33.394
Despite all appearances,
I am not dying anytime soon.

25:45.206 --> 25:46.907
Dr. Reynolds.

25:52.722 --> 25:55.356
So, how are things with you and Evie?

25:57.759 --> 26:00.728
You... you just went
right there, didn't you?

26:00.762 --> 26:02.396
I'm sorry, okay?

26:02.431 --> 26:04.732
I just don't have the headspace
for small talk anymore.

26:04.766 --> 26:07.368
All right, well, we're good, you know?

26:07.402 --> 26:10.404
We're... we're really good,
thanks to you.

26:10.439 --> 26:12.873
You taking her home
to meet the family yet?

26:12.908 --> 26:14.642
- Not yet.
- Why not?

26:14.676 --> 26:17.612
You should get on that.

26:17.646 --> 26:19.747
You know, it's good to have you back.

26:20.218 --> 26:21.819
- "Back."
- Yeah.

26:21.853 --> 26:23.296
You're back, aren't you?

26:24.456 --> 26:26.857
I was actually here to talk to Max

26:26.892 --> 26:28.650
about extending my leave.

26:28.684 --> 26:30.095
Oh, for how long?

26:31.563 --> 26:33.530
Like... forever.

26:35.861 --> 26:37.686
Is there any chance
I can change your mind?

26:39.604 --> 26:41.272
No.

26:41.306 --> 26:45.209
Any chance, I mean,
Max can change your mind?

26:45.243 --> 26:47.712
No, which is why I wanted to

26:47.746 --> 26:49.714
talk to him in person.

26:49.748 --> 26:51.241
Have you seen him?

26:54.752 --> 26:57.754
What, it's that bad?

26:57.779 --> 26:59.583
It's way worse.

27:00.718 --> 27:04.054
Jeez, I thought I was the liability.

27:05.971 --> 27:07.257
Hey, Lauren?

27:10.001 --> 27:11.803
You know I got you, right?

27:21.079 --> 27:23.925
Hey, whoa. Is there a problem?

27:23.959 --> 27:26.083
Caught this guy stealing
these from the hospital.

27:31.123 --> 27:34.325
Uh, no, he... he didn't steal those.

27:34.359 --> 27:36.385
Uh, I... I gave them to him.

27:36.420 --> 27:38.796
It was part of a needle exchange program.

27:40.358 --> 27:42.000
Luke.

27:48.974 --> 27:50.587
Well,

27:50.587 --> 27:53.555
it's, uh... it's all out in the open now.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.191
Hannah told us that her sister

27:55.225 --> 27:56.659
was a victim of abuse as well.

27:57.265 --> 27:58.761
But she never imagined her sister

27:58.795 --> 28:02.031
would do... that to someone else,

28:02.065 --> 28:04.200
let alone a member of her family.

28:04.234 --> 28:06.035
I'll call Child Protective.

28:06.069 --> 28:08.337
Great, thank you.

28:08.777 --> 28:10.273
Will they be okay?

28:10.307 --> 28:12.614
Yeah, I think so.

28:12.936 --> 28:16.739
Just... it'll take
a little time, you know?

28:20.958 --> 28:23.893
- Thank you.
- For what?

28:25.756 --> 28:27.212
Being you.

28:30.260 --> 28:32.995
Yeah, I'm not sure
that's a good thing anymore.

28:50.147 --> 28:51.747
Feng starts kindergarten in two weeks.

28:51.782 --> 28:53.816
- He was so excited.
- I understand,

28:53.850 --> 28:56.783
but active TB is highly contagious.

28:57.187 --> 28:59.922
If you go home or Feng goes to school,

28:59.957 --> 29:02.925
you risk infecting a great many people.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.927
You can infect your entire family.

29:04.962 --> 29:06.796
I want NaiNai.

29:15.806 --> 29:18.741
Will they get the best care
here at the hospital?

29:19.068 --> 29:20.307
Yes.

29:21.979 --> 29:24.413
_

29:30.220 --> 29:33.623
Bao Bao, NaiNai is here.

29:33.657 --> 29:35.791
And I'm not leaving.

29:52.843 --> 29:54.810
Ann and Feng need more
than just antibiotics.

29:54.845 --> 29:57.313
- They need their family.
- Right.

29:57.347 --> 29:59.348
Then their family can come
during visiting hours.

29:59.383 --> 30:01.183
How do you think that 80-year-old woman

30:01.218 --> 30:02.718
can sit on that stool?

30:02.753 --> 30:04.720
Or for any one of them
can stare at their loved ones

30:04.755 --> 30:06.355
through that glass wall?

30:06.390 --> 30:07.692
The family will adapt.

30:07.726 --> 30:09.604
That's what I'm scared of.

30:09.639 --> 30:12.061
They will adapt to a life
without each other.

30:12.095 --> 30:14.130
Look, there's nothing
we can do, all right?

30:14.164 --> 30:16.999
Ann and Feng have to stay in isolation.

30:51.435 --> 30:55.237
Dr. Goodwin, can I get you a wheelchair?

30:57.441 --> 31:00.142
Yes, thank you.

31:57.300 --> 31:58.901
- Max.
- Could you give me a hand?

31:58.935 --> 32:02.104
I don't remember
this slope being so steep.

32:02.139 --> 32:04.807
Max, you need to stop.

32:04.841 --> 32:05.941
Why? No.

32:05.976 --> 32:07.510
The Community Care office needs these.

32:07.544 --> 32:09.512
They're gonna help pass them out.

32:09.546 --> 32:11.413
How long has it been

32:11.448 --> 32:13.282
since you could swallow your own saliva?

32:13.316 --> 32:15.518
- Few days.
- Can you get dressed?

32:15.552 --> 32:18.610
- Shower by yourself?
- Look, the chemo's working.

32:19.569 --> 32:21.290
It's working. Stauton said it could be

32:21.324 --> 32:23.492
as little as... as three months.

32:23.527 --> 32:25.325
"Three months"?

32:25.829 --> 32:28.864
You won't make it three weeks.
You're wasting away.

32:28.899 --> 32:31.967
Look, I just need to hang on
a little bit longer.

32:32.002 --> 32:33.469
The numbers don't lie.

32:33.503 --> 32:34.770
The cancer will be cured,

32:34.805 --> 32:37.587
but we will run the last course
of chemo into your dead body.

32:38.208 --> 32:41.010
You are dying, Max.

32:43.346 --> 32:46.849
Well, then this may be one
of the last things I do.

32:46.883 --> 32:49.485
Just... just... Max!

32:49.519 --> 32:50.553
Oh...

32:50.587 --> 32:52.555
No, it's okay. We're fine, thank you.

32:52.589 --> 32:55.224
It's over, you are done. No more chemo.

32:55.258 --> 32:56.992
- You're not my doctor.
- I am now.

32:57.027 --> 32:58.527
I am your doctor, Max.

32:58.562 --> 33:00.162
I'm taking you off the chemo
and radiation.

33:00.197 --> 33:01.497
I'm gonna find you a different regimen,

33:01.531 --> 33:03.196
and I'm gonna save your life.

33:03.667 --> 33:06.074
But first thing I'm gonna do
is send you home.

33:09.005 --> 33:11.079
It's time for you to go home, Max.

33:15.512 --> 33:19.081
You're going home to stay alive.

33:30.527 --> 33:32.595
This is not the end.

34:09.251 --> 34:11.147
Dr. Frome?

34:13.884 --> 34:16.485
I'm sorry to have put you through this.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.353
Are you serious?

34:18.389 --> 34:21.391
You put my entire
medical practice in jeopardy,

34:21.425 --> 34:23.259
and now you're just gonna... what?

34:23.293 --> 34:24.860
You're just gonna let me off the hook?

34:24.895 --> 34:27.563
I realize you were just
trying to help him.

34:27.598 --> 34:29.032
But I didn't.

34:30.301 --> 34:31.868
You were right about me.

34:32.666 --> 34:33.931
Dr. Frome...

34:33.965 --> 34:36.773
Do you... do you have any idea
how many patients

34:36.806 --> 34:38.741
I have held in my arms?

34:38.775 --> 34:41.244
How many kids I've bought clothes for?

34:41.277 --> 34:42.553
Books for?

34:42.587 --> 34:46.248
I try so hard to make them feel safe...

34:47.485 --> 34:48.885
Make them feel the love

34:48.918 --> 34:50.453
that they should have gotten
somewhere else.

34:50.487 --> 34:54.556
I can see that now.
What you did for Avi...

34:55.326 --> 34:58.461
only you could do that for him.

34:58.496 --> 34:59.863
That's the problem.

35:00.355 --> 35:02.432
If you hadn't filed your report,

35:02.466 --> 35:04.367
Avi would have gone on to some therapist

35:04.859 --> 35:06.202
and he would have had a huge setback

35:06.237 --> 35:09.113
because he couldn't speak
his truth to anybody but me.

35:10.073 --> 35:12.475
If I'm only teaching patients
to speak to me

35:12.510 --> 35:15.278
and not to deal with the world
after they leave my care,

35:15.312 --> 35:16.496
well...

35:17.681 --> 35:19.415
the phrase I would use for that

35:19.450 --> 35:21.784
is "non therapeutic relationship."

35:23.821 --> 35:26.155
The rules exist for a reason,

35:26.190 --> 35:28.758
and I broke them repeatedly.

35:30.461 --> 35:35.265
Now the only thing for me to do
is to be a different therapist.

35:37.268 --> 35:39.477
Different therapist than I want to be.

35:41.062 --> 35:42.689
Than I know how to be.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.180
Vijay.

35:51.739 --> 35:54.117
There's nothing more to do for the Shins.

35:55.352 --> 35:57.287
Ansuya and I were a...

35:58.037 --> 35:59.539
love match.

36:01.445 --> 36:03.880
But my parents didn't approve...

36:06.055 --> 36:08.724
So we saw them less and less.

36:12.176 --> 36:14.220
Along the way, we made...

36:14.929 --> 36:16.806
many little decisions...

36:18.016 --> 36:19.684
that added up to...

36:21.679 --> 36:24.213
A big distance between us.

36:26.383 --> 36:27.859
Soon...

36:29.152 --> 36:31.195
family meant only...

36:32.843 --> 36:34.511
me...

36:36.117 --> 36:37.535
Ansuya...

36:39.662 --> 36:41.297
And Rohan.

36:42.933 --> 36:44.959
So you don't see them anymore?

36:47.295 --> 36:49.539
We haven't spoken to each other for a...

36:51.416 --> 36:53.217
Long, long time.

37:04.421 --> 37:07.857
We won't let that happen
to the Shins, will we?

37:09.893 --> 37:11.694
No.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.596
We won't.

38:03.580 --> 38:05.381
How long have you been standing there?

38:05.416 --> 38:06.783
I gotta come clean.

38:07.417 --> 38:08.651
Okay.

38:08.686 --> 38:11.387
Ta-Nehisi may be my boy,

38:11.422 --> 38:14.657
but I have a whole family
who still thinks of me

38:14.692 --> 38:16.626
as their boy.

38:16.660 --> 38:18.961
So we won't go this Sunday.

38:18.996 --> 38:21.593
Well, that's the thing.
I'm not saying no to this Sunday.

38:21.627 --> 38:23.900
I'm saying no to every Sunday.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.937
That's how important my family is, and...

38:28.438 --> 38:29.839
I think I was afraid to admit that.

38:30.565 --> 38:31.808
Why?

38:32.233 --> 38:35.111
Well, there's a whole part of me

38:35.145 --> 38:37.580
outside this hospital
that you don't know.

38:37.614 --> 38:41.017
You know, like church, my aging mom,

38:41.051 --> 38:44.754
my sisters ganging up on me, you know?

38:44.788 --> 38:46.489
What if you didn't like that part of me?

38:46.523 --> 38:48.024
Or them?

38:48.058 --> 38:50.426
- How could I not?
- You don't know my family.

38:50.461 --> 38:52.028
Well, you're right. I don't.

38:52.062 --> 38:55.465
So I'd better be meeting them
this Sunday.

38:58.869 --> 39:00.970
I don't have an appointment,

39:01.004 --> 39:04.107
but I'm hoping you can fit me in.

39:04.141 --> 39:06.542
Well, I will have to check my books.

39:09.980 --> 39:13.049
Our hotel...
I can't wait for you to see it.

39:13.083 --> 39:16.018
It is in the center
of the historic district.

39:16.053 --> 39:17.820
Three Michelin-starred restaurants

39:17.855 --> 39:19.572
in walking distance.

39:27.931 --> 39:30.458
But you won't be joining me, will you?

39:31.702 --> 39:33.252
I can't.

39:35.838 --> 39:38.140
Akash, I am so sorry.

39:39.610 --> 39:41.911
Right now, I can't imagine...

39:41.945 --> 39:45.214
sitting on a panel defending
traditional chemotherapy

39:45.249 --> 39:48.718
when my day has been
one long, crushing example

39:48.752 --> 39:52.155
of precisely how traditional
chemotherapy can fail.

39:54.878 --> 39:56.484
This is about Max.

39:58.629 --> 40:01.030
Yes, it is.

40:03.200 --> 40:07.069
Max helped me rediscover
my love of medicine

40:07.620 --> 40:09.539
and got me back in the hospital.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.607
And it's not just me.

40:11.642 --> 40:15.578
You can see it on the faces
of all the doctors.

40:15.612 --> 40:18.614
All the nurses. All the staff.

40:18.649 --> 40:22.118
He has helped them all so much,
so profoundly.

40:22.152 --> 40:23.594
And now...

40:24.428 --> 40:26.347
it's our turn to help him.

41:39.129 --> 41:41.097
Max.

41:41.672 --> 41:44.533
You're not answering your phone, so...
