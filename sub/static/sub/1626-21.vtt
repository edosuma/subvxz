00:02.068 --> 00:05.838
Who or what did you do
to get this $20 tip?

00:05.840 --> 00:08.707
Because I wheeled a customer
home the other night,

00:08.709 --> 00:10.943
And all I got was a 5.

00:10.945 --> 00:14.446
And that was after we made out
and I gave him a bath.

00:14.448 --> 00:17.616
The lady at that table
asked me what was special here,

00:17.618 --> 00:22.221
And I said, "I used to be,"
and then I burst into tears.

00:22.223 --> 00:25.324
I pull that out
whenever I need a manicure.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.626
Well, it's that time
of year again.

00:27.628 --> 00:28.794
I'm so jealous.

00:28.796 --> 00:29.862
I can't believe you only get

00:29.864 --> 00:31.997
Your period once a year.

00:31.999 --> 00:34.366
It's tax season,
and my accountant said

00:34.368 --> 00:35.467
I'm getting a refund.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.569
He also complimented
these moccasins,

00:37.571 --> 00:40.506
Which are also controversial
around here.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.674
Well, they do have the word
"mock..."

00:42.676 --> 00:45.044
"ass..."
and "sin."

00:45.046 --> 00:47.079
This is why I never wear
overalls,

00:47.081 --> 00:48.380
'cause you two would be...

00:48.382 --> 00:49.415
Overall...
Disgusted?

00:49.417 --> 00:51.083
Precisely.

00:51.085 --> 00:53.519
Oh, earl, that reminds me.

00:53.521 --> 00:54.753
I forgot.
Here you go.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.021
I finished your taxes.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.589
And for the future
you cannot claim

00:57.591 --> 01:00.526
Your weed dealer
as a dependent.

01:00.528 --> 01:04.063
I don't know why.
I'm very dependent on weed.

01:05.665 --> 01:08.500
Max, since I've been helping
everyone with their taxes,

01:08.502 --> 01:10.202
Mostly because the only
other time I get to use

01:10.204 --> 01:12.905
My financial degree is counting
how many q-tips we have left,

01:12.907 --> 01:14.373
Five--

01:14.375 --> 01:16.408
Three.
I dropped two in the toilet,

01:16.410 --> 01:19.545
And the cockroach is using them
as oars for his boat.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.580
Ha.
That'll be cute.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.949
Look, there are two things
I won't talk about--

01:23.951 --> 01:26.218
Taxes
or your flying dreams.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.520
Face it, caroline.
You're not going anywhere.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.923
Okay, well, we have
to talk about our taxes

01:30.925 --> 01:33.392
And what we're gonna claim,
and, no, you cannot claim

01:33.394 --> 01:35.094
I'm ruining your life.

01:35.096 --> 01:40.566
Why? I did that last year
and got $10 back.

It's only 12:30.

Nice try, max.
Come on, let's leave early.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.926
I'm more exhausted
than my bra.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.295
Whoa, good,
you're still open.

02:10.297 --> 02:14.466
My fiancee wants a cupcake, and
she always gets what she wants.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.803
Hi.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.471
I mean, I really want
a house in the hamptons,

02:19.473 --> 02:21.740
But I'll take a cupcake.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.575
I'm nothing like that sounded.

02:23.577 --> 02:24.843
Don't apologize.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.645
I'm everything
like that sounded.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.680
Oh, I'll be right back, babe.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.649
There's a homeless guy building
a shopping bag house

02:30.651 --> 02:32.451
Around the porsche.

02:32.453 --> 02:35.721
Too bad. That homeless guy
almost had a front porsche.

02:37.524 --> 02:39.291
He hates this neighborhood.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.026
So you've been held up
at gunpoint one or two times?

02:41.028 --> 02:43.262
It's like,
grow a pair, right?

02:43.264 --> 02:44.696
So what are you eating?

02:44.698 --> 02:46.365
Um, chocolate.

02:46.367 --> 02:49.601
But, wait, now I'm thinking
red velvet.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.970
Tim put my ring in one
when he proposed.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.972
Oh, he proposed with one
of our cupcakes?

02:53.974 --> 02:55.274
That's so sweet.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.542
Yeah, it was.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.676
I mean, it was
like a whole thing

02:57.678 --> 02:58.777
Because I swallowed it,

02:58.779 --> 02:59.811
But, once it passed,

02:59.813 --> 03:02.014
Really so pretty.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.550
I gave him a 20 to move
to that mini cooper

03:04.552 --> 03:05.951
Instead of our car.

03:05.953 --> 03:09.021
Remind me to start calling han
"mini cooper."

03:09.023 --> 03:11.557
Babe, I've been thinking.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.458
Uh-oh.
That's never good.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.627
No, it's great, babe.
Listen.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.462
So, since you proposed to me

03:17.464 --> 03:18.630
With one of their cupcakes,

03:18.632 --> 03:20.032
I was thinking
that these girls

03:20.034 --> 03:21.667
Should do our wedding cake.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.569
But, babe, we already ordered
a wedding cake.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.038
$1,300.
Remember, babe?

03:26.040 --> 03:27.639
I know, but, babe.

03:27.641 --> 03:31.310
They said babe less
in the movie <i>babe.</i>

03:31.312 --> 03:33.212
So do you guys
do wedding cakes?

03:33.214 --> 03:34.413
No.
Yes.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.648
I don't.
She does.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.583
She's the baker,
and, yes,

03:37.585 --> 03:38.884
We do tons
of wedding cakes.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.219
Gay weddings,
straight weddings.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.221
Bed wettings.

03:42.223 --> 03:43.989
Claire, you do
whatever you want,

03:43.991 --> 03:45.490
But I'm gonna wait
in the car.

03:45.492 --> 03:48.594
I just can't do the cake stuff
again, babe.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.329
He doesn't want
to do the cake stuff.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.598
Well, I don't want
to do the butt stuff.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.765
You know what I mean?

03:53.767 --> 03:56.001
No.
Yes.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.669
Why don't you come in
and we can talk about it?

03:57.671 --> 03:59.004
Enter through the diner.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.739
Okay.
See you guys in a sec.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.075
What is wrong with you?

04:03.077 --> 04:06.011
I told you I didn't want any
more white girls in the shop.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.548
And since when do we do
wedding cakes?

04:09.550 --> 04:11.883
Since that guy said $1,300.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.219
You can do this, max.
You went to pastry school.

04:14.221 --> 04:16.421
I also went to high school,

04:16.423 --> 04:20.292
But I can't tell you
which president rock hudson was.

04:20.294 --> 04:21.627
I don't do wedding cakes.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.195
Okay, I know this may not be

04:23.197 --> 04:25.397
The best time for you to make
your first wedding cake

04:25.399 --> 04:26.698
Because of your recent breakup.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.767
Oh, it's not about deke.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.304
If you remember, I'm the one
who sent his 'fro out the door.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.239
Weddings are just stupid.

04:34.241 --> 04:36.608
This whole idea
of celebrating love?

04:36.610 --> 04:39.811
I mean, love works out less
than chris christie.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.813
Right through here.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.749
There you go, miss.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.617
Thanks.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.119
Did you want
something else?

04:47.121 --> 04:49.955
I'll take
whatever I can get.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.758
Okay, we're done.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.993
You're lucky.
This morning, a cannoli shell

04:54.995 --> 04:57.929
Pressed sexual harassment
charges against him.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.832
Oh, my god, you guys.

05:00.834 --> 05:01.900
Your shop is so adorbs.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.068
I'm claire, by the way.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.569
I owned a store
on bedford ave.

05:04.571 --> 05:07.105
A dress shop
called "get the frock out."

05:07.107 --> 05:09.574
Oh, I remember
that place.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.009
Wasn't it right next
to the hair salon,

05:11.011 --> 05:12.811
"unbeweavable?"

05:12.813 --> 05:15.514
Yeah, yeah,
between "unbeweavable"

05:15.516 --> 05:16.682
And the kosher smoothie place

05:16.684 --> 05:18.684
Called "the wandering juice."

05:18.686 --> 05:22.821
I love
their menorah-nge juice.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.691
Yeah, you know, it was always
my dream to have a dress shop.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.826
But then after a year
hardly anyone was coming in,

05:27.828 --> 05:30.762
And I was like, maybe I
should get the frock out.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.131
So I bailed.
I totally get it.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.666
Our first shop failed,
but we got up,

05:34.668 --> 05:36.134
Dusted ourselves off--

05:36.136 --> 05:38.170
Well, max went
on a four-day bender,

05:38.172 --> 05:39.805
But I found her
and dusted her off,

05:39.807 --> 05:41.506
Then we started again.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.841
Yeah, good thing
you downloaded

05:42.843 --> 05:45.043
The "find your drunk
roommate" app.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.879
Oh, so you guys kept going,
even though you failed?

05:47.881 --> 05:50.048
Why?
Don't you have boyfriends?

05:51.617 --> 05:53.985
[chuckles] so when are you two
getting married?

05:53.987 --> 05:55.354
Oh, in three days.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.656
Three days?
You're so calm.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.392
Yeah, well, I was in the plane
that crashed in the hudson,

06:00.394 --> 06:04.296
So after that everything's
just kind of been "meh."

06:04.298 --> 06:07.466
So do you know what kind
of cake you want?

06:07.468 --> 06:09.568
Absolutely.
Something traditional,

06:09.570 --> 06:11.970
Something very old school,
you know, very romantic,

06:11.972 --> 06:13.572
But, wait,
now I'm thinking

06:13.574 --> 06:15.507
You guys are so cool,

06:15.509 --> 06:17.676
What if we did something with a
weird hipster williamsburg vibe?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.578
So you want
an obnoxious cake

06:19.580 --> 06:21.480
On a trust fund
wearing an ironic t-shirt

06:21.482 --> 06:24.416
With hpv?

06:24.418 --> 06:27.319
But, wait, now I'm thinking
pastels for spring.

06:27.321 --> 06:29.087
Oh, but, wait,
now I'm thinking,

06:29.089 --> 06:31.256
Colors.
I love clowns.

06:31.258 --> 06:36.528
Wow, she changes her mind more
than I change my underwear.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.797
So twice?

06:44.904 --> 06:46.438
Sophie,
on your tax form here,

06:46.440 --> 06:50.709
You listed your occupation
as "sophie."

06:50.711 --> 06:54.346
Yeah, it's a full-time job,
baby.

06:54.348 --> 06:59.351
And who claims
$5,000 worth of mascara?

06:59.353 --> 07:02.921
It's a business deduction
for my cleaning business.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.857
I give it out to all
the underage girls from poland

07:05.859 --> 07:07.392
As treats.

07:07.394 --> 07:09.628
Just because you're
scrubbing toilets

07:09.630 --> 07:12.864
Doesn't mean
your eyes can't pop.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.567
Do you have any legitimate
anything that we can use

07:15.569 --> 07:17.369
For anything?

07:17.371 --> 07:19.404
Here's a big receipt.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.874
$2,500 for stolichnaya.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.110
You can't write off liquor.

07:25.112 --> 07:29.114
No, irina stolichnaya.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.216
Yeah, she waxes
my eyebrows.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.953
And my downstairs eyebrows.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.890
Okay, well, there's no line
on this form

07:38.892 --> 07:42.961
For downstairs eyebrows,
so I'm just gonna list it

07:42.963 --> 07:46.231
As home office.

07:46.233 --> 07:50.635
Yeah, well,
I do work out of it.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.437
Caroline,
where's max?

07:52.439 --> 07:54.573
As much as I enjoy
a two-hour break

07:54.575 --> 07:56.908
From being called
a tiny woman,

07:56.910 --> 08:00.779
She's supposed
to be working.

08:00.781 --> 08:01.847
Max, how's the cake going?

08:01.849 --> 08:05.150
That bride's a mess.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.920
She changed her mind
while she was changing her mind.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.657
Not the good stuff
on the top shelf!

08:12.659 --> 08:16.595
Oh, you can't reach it
anyway, mini cooper.

08:18.331 --> 08:22.701
Joke's on her.
I have a collapsible ladder.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.803
[cell phone rings]

08:24.805 --> 08:28.507
Oh, hi, claire.
Max is working on it right now.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.275
Oh, you've been thinking?

08:30.277 --> 08:34.246
Caroline, can I get anything
for a panty liner?

08:38.017 --> 08:39.885
I'm on the phone
with claire.

08:39.887 --> 08:42.153
You mean un-claire?

08:42.155 --> 08:44.723
She wants to make
a couple changes.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.992
What should I tell her?
Tell her I hate her.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.194
No, you know what,
I'll tell her.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.496
I love to tell people things.
Give me the phone.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.499
Max, I beg you.
$1,300.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.800
Oh, my god.
She is so crazy.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.035
I should just make a giant cake

08:57.037 --> 08:58.904
And have a psychiatrist
pop out of it.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.372
Give me the phone.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.074
Hey, claire, babe.
What's happening, babe?

09:03.076 --> 09:05.043
(claire)
max, I've been thinking,

09:05.045 --> 09:07.012
And I know I said I didn't want
the fondant frosting,

09:07.014 --> 09:08.647
But now I just saw a photo
of another wedding cake

09:08.649 --> 09:10.916
That was so gorge.

09:10.918 --> 09:14.019
And I started thinking...

09:14.021 --> 09:15.921
Uh-huh. Sure.
No problem.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.055
(claire)
so then we can do the fondant?

09:17.057 --> 09:19.824
Yes, definitely fondant.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.693
(claire)
perfect. Bye. Love you.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.863
Love you too.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.865

19:40.346 --> 19:42.547
[laughter]

19:42.549 --> 19:44.148
This is nice.

19:44.150 --> 19:46.551
And that cake
really is beautiful.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.985
Thanks.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.555
Wish I could have showed it
to...

19:50.557 --> 19:51.722
Deke.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.658
Yeah.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.059
So are you really okay?

19:55.061 --> 19:56.694
I know you loved him.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.629
I did, which is the worst

19:58.631 --> 20:00.731
Because it made me feel
almost like a person.

20:01.733 --> 20:04.368
Max, caroline, hi.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.537
I just wanted to say
thank you for everything.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.739
And I was watching you guys
dance together,

20:08.741 --> 20:12.643
And now I'm thinking
I might be into girls.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.478
Can I call you?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.247
Yes.
No.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.716
Great.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.753
What do you mean the bottom
of the cake says radio shack?

20:22.755 --> 20:25.323
That's our cue.

20:25.325 --> 20:28.392
Wait, wait, I haven't thrown
the bouquet yet.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.694
Hey, single ladies.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.028
<i>Here we go.</i>

20:31.030 --> 20:34.765
One, two,

20:34.767 --> 20:37.668
Three.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.705
Hey, cake girls.

20:40.707 --> 20:41.906
Styrofoam?

20:41.908 --> 20:44.075
It's gluten-free.
