00:00.494 --> 00:01.794
<i>Previously on</i> Heartland:

00:01.795 --> 00:04.195
Clint: I have to take Georgina
back to the group home

00:04.299 --> 00:05.965
until further arrangements
can be made.

00:06.033 --> 00:07.434
No. No, Grandpa.

00:07.501 --> 00:09.436
She can stay here
for a couple of days...

00:09.503 --> 00:10.937
<i>I guess.</i>

00:11.004 --> 00:12.138
<i>Dan:</i> <i>You should
know</i> <i>that Lisa and I</i>

00:12.206 --> 00:13.940
will be keeping
our finances separate.

00:14.007 --> 00:16.743
Isn't that a given considering
you guys are divorced?

00:16.811 --> 00:18.745
Now that we've reconciled,

00:18.813 --> 00:20.714
we may be pooling
our resources.

00:20.781 --> 00:25.283
I already bought the place
that you liked in France.

00:25.352 --> 00:27.553
What about us?
Where does that leave us?

00:27.620 --> 00:30.522
We should take a break,
don't you think?

00:33.693 --> 00:36.462
(Grass rustles in the breeze,
horses whinny)

00:37.396 --> 00:39.464
(Birds chirp,
insects buzz)

00:46.271 --> 00:47.605
(Horse neighs)

00:49.641 --> 00:51.476
(Soft thudding of hooves)

00:59.417 --> 01:00.484
(Leaves rustle)

01:01.719 --> 01:03.119
(Log clunks)

01:03.187 --> 01:04.421
(Foal whinnies, panicked)

01:06.290 --> 01:07.657
(Foal whinnies)

01:09.860 --> 01:11.927
(Log bangs around)

01:15.965 --> 01:17.533
(Snorts nervously)

01:19.870 --> 01:21.537
Lou:
Okay, Grandpa! Eat!

01:21.605 --> 01:23.506
Didn't you guys wanna get
an early start?

01:23.573 --> 01:25.440
Jack: Well, I wouldn't mind
a cup of coffee first.

01:25.508 --> 01:26.641
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Amy! Ty!</i>

01:26.709 --> 01:28.142
I have been trying
to keep the eggs warm.

01:28.210 --> 01:29.744
Amy:
Relax, Lou.

01:29.812 --> 01:31.312
Grandpa, we've got the truck
all packed.

01:31.380 --> 01:32.213
I'm gonna load Spartan
and Harley

01:32.281 --> 01:33.314
before we leave.

01:33.382 --> 01:34.682
Jack:
Why are we taking horses?

01:34.750 --> 01:36.785
We're going to Stumpy's
fishing camp to work,

01:36.852 --> 01:38.986
not to go on a leisurely
trail ride.

01:39.054 --> 01:40.722
Is that why you're taking
your fishing gear?

01:40.790 --> 01:43.323
Well, if there's time,
and that is a big if,

01:43.391 --> 01:46.827
yes, I thought I would do
a little bit of fishing.

01:46.895 --> 01:48.061
Peter: So what's,
uh, Stumpy's story

01:48.129 --> 01:49.630
that he's got you doing
all this, Jack?

01:49.697 --> 01:51.364
Jack: Oh, he's got a
big family reunion

01:51.433 --> 01:52.666
coming up this weekend

01:52.734 --> 01:55.502
and the guy just broke
his good leg.

01:55.570 --> 01:57.370
There's all these tents
that need putting up,

01:57.438 --> 01:59.104
and I thought that was
the least we could do for him.

02:04.511 --> 02:06.011
Georgie: Look at the
rod Jack bought me!

02:06.079 --> 02:07.379
He's gonna teach me
to fly fish.

02:07.448 --> 02:08.981
Ty:
Really.

02:09.049 --> 02:10.316
I thought it was all work,
Jack?

02:10.383 --> 02:11.717
(Chuckling)

02:11.785 --> 02:12.952
Georgie: Come on,
guys, we have to go!

02:13.019 --> 02:14.753
Georgie,
eat some breakfast!

02:14.821 --> 02:16.955
Georgie: No!
I don't wanna barf in the truck.

02:17.022 --> 02:18.323
Ty: Okay.
I just lost my appetite.

02:18.390 --> 02:19.458
(Laughing)

02:19.525 --> 02:20.859
I'm gonna go load
the horses.

02:20.927 --> 02:22.928
Georgie: Hey, Katie,
are you gonna miss us?

02:22.995 --> 02:24.095
You're gonna miss us,
huh?

02:24.163 --> 02:25.163
(Katie coos)

02:27.667 --> 02:29.667
Miss them?
I can't wait until they leave.

02:29.734 --> 02:31.034
Stop it.

02:31.102 --> 02:32.069
Okay, everybody,
let's get this show on the road.

02:32.136 --> 02:33.604
You're gonna be late.

02:33.672 --> 02:36.440
Georgie: Exactly! Come on!
Hurry up! Come on!

02:36.508 --> 02:38.776
(Car rumbles)

02:39.578 --> 02:42.012
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Don't forget your snacks...
</i> <i>And have a great day.</i>

02:42.080 --> 02:43.581
Yeah.
Have fun out there!

02:43.648 --> 02:45.248
(Knocking)

02:45.316 --> 02:47.316
Jack: Now, where are my gloves?
I left them right here.

02:47.384 --> 02:48.885
Georgie: You don't need your gloves.
Let's go!

02:48.953 --> 02:52.221
(Knocking,
screen door snaps shut)

02:52.289 --> 02:54.457
<i>Jack: Clint!</i>
Clint: I knocked but...

02:54.525 --> 02:56.593
Uh, no, I'm glad
to see you, man,

02:56.660 --> 02:58.495
but bad timing.

02:58.562 --> 03:00.196
We're just on our way out.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.497
But, Jack,
today is the day.

03:01.564 --> 03:03.031
The day for what?

03:03.099 --> 03:04.967
Uh, this, this in the only day
I have to...

03:05.034 --> 03:07.035
<i>Spend some time with you.</i>

03:07.103 --> 03:08.737
Georgie: What does he mean?
He can't!

03:08.805 --> 03:10.572
Clint: I left you a message.
Didn't you get it?

03:10.640 --> 03:11.940
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>No, I never got a message.</i>

03:14.844 --> 03:16.645
Oh, Georgie...

03:16.713 --> 03:18.046
Clint:
Jack, I'm serious.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.215
This is the day we have
to accomplish, you know,

03:20.282 --> 03:21.682
<i>what we discussed.</i>

03:21.750 --> 03:23.784
Jack: I know, I know.
You're right.

03:23.852 --> 03:25.487
Georgie: Wait.
Does this mean you can't go camping?

03:25.554 --> 03:27.822
It means we can't go camping.

03:27.890 --> 03:29.424
Does this mean you're not
going away for the weekend?

03:30.826 --> 03:31.893
You promised!

03:33.529 --> 03:37.831
Um, Grandpa, can I speak to you,
privately, please?

03:41.369 --> 03:44.038
I thought that you were already
Georgie's foster parent?

03:44.105 --> 03:47.841
Temporary foster parent,
but I wanna be long term.

03:47.909 --> 03:49.576
I didn't even know
you'd applied.

03:49.644 --> 03:51.310
Isn't this something
we should've decided together,

03:51.378 --> 03:53.146
as a family?

03:53.213 --> 03:56.082
Jack: It's something I decided
to do and I'm gonna do it.

03:56.150 --> 03:57.816
So Clint's here
to interview me,

03:57.884 --> 04:00.153
and he needs to talk
to Georgie too,

04:00.220 --> 04:02.855
but he can't tell her
the reason because...

04:02.923 --> 04:04.590
Well, we don't want her
to get her hopes up.

04:04.658 --> 04:06.558
Okay. Well, we'll have
to cancel the trip then.

04:06.625 --> 04:07.759
Ty:
Whoa! What?

04:07.826 --> 04:09.094
No, that's not
a good idea.

04:09.162 --> 04:11.663
'Cause I think it's unfair
to go without her.

04:11.730 --> 04:14.232
But, Jack, you promised Stumpy
that we'd get those tents up.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.934
Yeah!

04:16.000 --> 04:17.202
Jack: Well, you and Amy, you
could do that job can't you?

04:17.269 --> 04:19.303
<i>Why don't you guys go up</i>
<i>on your own?</i>

04:19.372 --> 04:20.872
Yeah.

04:20.940 --> 04:22.473
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

04:22.541 --> 04:23.607
(Lou sighs heavily)

04:25.577 --> 04:27.411
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:29.514 --> 04:31.715
- You and I.
- You and me.

05:35.176 --> 05:36.977
You know, this little gizmo
has a tape recorder function?

05:37.045 --> 05:38.512
I didn't even know
it had it, myself,

05:38.579 --> 05:41.314
until I hit the icon thing
by accident.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.516
Um, okay, first up.

05:43.583 --> 05:47.386
Do I have your permission
to record your responses?

05:47.454 --> 05:49.122
I guess.

05:49.189 --> 05:50.556
Okay...

05:51.525 --> 05:53.259
Relax, Jack.

05:53.326 --> 05:54.260
I'm sure that
the "powers that be"

05:54.327 --> 05:55.528
will be more than satisfied.

05:55.595 --> 05:56.896
I mean, you've got a pretty
good track record

05:56.964 --> 05:58.330
with "At risk youth,"

05:58.398 --> 05:59.798
and from what
you've told me,

05:59.866 --> 06:00.999
you and Georgie
have developed

06:01.067 --> 06:02.668
a very solid and trusting
relationship

06:02.735 --> 06:04.002
over the past few months.

06:04.070 --> 06:05.070
A real bond.

06:05.138 --> 06:06.571
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>(Yelling) Jack!</i>

06:06.639 --> 06:10.375
They left without me!
I will never ever forgive you!

06:12.344 --> 06:13.411
(Screen door snaps shut)

06:13.479 --> 06:14.912
Was that thing recording?

06:14.980 --> 06:16.380
Oh yeah.

06:16.447 --> 06:18.315
<i>Tim:</i> <i>Hey, Jack,</i> <i>what's going on?</i>

06:18.383 --> 06:19.750
I just saw Ty and Amy
on their way out.

06:19.818 --> 06:21.118
I thought you were
going to Stumpy's.

06:21.186 --> 06:22.553
I didn't realize they were
going on their own?

06:22.620 --> 06:25.522
It's fine, Tim.
They'll be back tomorrow.

06:25.590 --> 06:27.224
What, they're staying
overnight?

06:27.292 --> 06:29.393
<i>What, did your good judgment</i>
<i>fly right out the window?</i>

06:29.460 --> 06:30.860
How ya doing, Clint?

06:30.928 --> 06:33.529
Tim, I'm just a little bit busy
here right now.

06:33.597 --> 06:35.732
Busy with what?
What're you working on?

06:35.800 --> 06:37.567
Peter:
So when did Jack decide that?

06:37.634 --> 06:39.035
It's a huge responsibility.

06:39.103 --> 06:40.536
I know, but...

06:40.604 --> 06:42.238
I mean, it's good.
It's great.

06:42.306 --> 06:43.306
Good for him.

06:43.373 --> 06:44.540
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

06:44.608 --> 06:46.375
I thought you were just
taking care of Georgie

06:46.443 --> 06:48.010
until Clint here found
another home for her.

06:48.078 --> 06:49.611
Well, you thought wrong.

06:49.679 --> 06:51.880
It's a big step.

06:51.948 --> 06:54.649
I've been thinking about
big steps myself lately.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.752
Oh yeah?
Like what?

06:56.820 --> 07:00.288
Well, there's a lot of rooms
in that old farmhouse of ours.

07:00.356 --> 07:01.790
So...?

07:01.858 --> 07:04.525
So... maybe it's time
we think about filling them.

07:04.593 --> 07:05.593
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

07:05.660 --> 07:07.028
You're old!

07:07.096 --> 07:08.495
I know what it's like
to take on a kid

07:08.563 --> 07:10.531
and it's not easy,
even at my age.

07:10.599 --> 07:12.133
And, Jack, you're a lot older
than I am.

07:12.201 --> 07:13.667
<i>Jack:</i> <i>It's so nice</i>
<i>to have your support.</i>

07:13.736 --> 07:15.302
Tim: Well, you don't.
You don't have my support!

07:15.370 --> 07:17.004
<i>Mark that down.</i>

07:17.072 --> 07:18.905
He does not have my support -
make a note.

07:18.973 --> 07:21.975
Somebody's gotta be realistic
about this!

07:22.977 --> 07:24.845
(Door opens and shuts)

07:26.848 --> 07:28.215
Tim:
How did you let this happen?

07:28.282 --> 07:29.315
Me?

07:31.119 --> 07:32.585
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Fix it, Lou.</i>

07:32.653 --> 07:35.921
God, I really needed a weekend
to ourselves.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.858
Hey, I know someone
who owns a dude ranch.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.692
Any empty cabins?

07:40.761 --> 07:41.794
There might be.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.795
Yeah?
Well, let's go.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.696
Grab some time
on our own,

07:45.765 --> 07:48.332
talk about those
empty rooms.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.834
Yeah.
Let's do it.

07:49.902 --> 07:51.269
All right.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.272
Clint: Jack, you know
that Tim's opinion

07:54.339 --> 07:56.407
doesn't come in to play with me
or the agency.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.609
This is all about you,
nobody else.

07:58.677 --> 08:00.443
Well, good.

08:00.511 --> 08:04.614
'Cause, well, Tim's opinion
doesn't wash with me, either.

08:04.682 --> 08:05.682
From what I can see,
though,

08:05.750 --> 08:07.017
you do have
a pretty full house.

08:07.085 --> 08:08.819
Are you thinking about adding
on to the place?

08:08.887 --> 08:10.720
Oh, I don't have
to do that, no.

08:10.789 --> 08:12.823
Lou and Peter will be
moving out real soon.

08:12.891 --> 08:14.992
That frees up two bedrooms
right there.

08:15.059 --> 08:17.593
So we've got more than
enough space.

08:17.661 --> 08:19.328
Lou:
Okay, so we have a plan.

08:19.396 --> 08:21.697
You and Georgie are gonna be
tied up this weekend,

08:21.765 --> 08:23.732
so we're gonna head over
to the dude ranch.

08:23.801 --> 08:25.701
It's a little crowded here.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.771
I hear you'll be moving into
your new place soon.

08:28.839 --> 08:30.439
Peter: Yeah, I'll believe
that when I see it.

08:30.507 --> 08:32.607
No, it could be
a few months still yet.

08:32.674 --> 08:35.443
But Jack's been nice enough
to let us all stay here.

08:35.510 --> 08:36.678
It's a little like
an overcrowded rooming house,

08:36.745 --> 08:39.447
but the more the merrier,
right?

08:41.217 --> 08:43.251
<i>(Katie coos)</i>

08:48.223 --> 08:50.124
Lou:
What's the matter, honey?

08:50.192 --> 08:52.526
Why are your cheeks
all red, huh?

08:53.461 --> 08:55.196
Why are you all red?

08:58.633 --> 09:00.367
Car's packed.
You all ready to go?

09:00.435 --> 09:02.602
Honey,
feel her forehead.

09:02.670 --> 09:04.871
(Sighs)
What's up, pumpkin?

09:04.939 --> 09:08.107
- Oh no.
- Yeah. She has a temperature.

09:08.175 --> 09:10.977
She's sick.
We're not going anywhere.

09:11.045 --> 09:12.478
(Sighs)

09:12.546 --> 09:15.014
Let's get you
some water.

09:15.082 --> 09:16.182
Can you get her
some water?

09:17.351 --> 09:18.651
(Truck rumbles)

09:35.401 --> 09:36.834
(Doors bang shut)

09:40.605 --> 09:42.373
Ty:
Hey, come here!

09:42.440 --> 09:44.941
Oh, wow!
This is pretty cool.

09:45.477 --> 09:47.778
Yeah. Come on,
let's go check this out.

09:53.684 --> 09:55.752
(Gasps) Wow!
- Oh!

09:55.819 --> 09:58.554
<i>Amy: This is so awesome!</i>
<i>Ty: Nice!</i>

09:58.622 --> 10:01.824
Amy: Well, I think we should
put up the tents later.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.659
Ty:
What do you wanna do instead?

10:09.465 --> 10:11.267
This was a good idea, Amy.

10:11.334 --> 10:14.003
It was a pretty good idea.

10:29.551 --> 10:31.319
- Amy...
- Ty, look! Look.

10:32.354 --> 10:33.854
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Oh, wow!</i>

10:33.923 --> 10:36.490
Amy: It's wildy.
Ty: Yeah.

10:36.558 --> 10:37.425
Let's see
if we can get closer.

10:37.492 --> 10:38.526
Okay.

10:44.432 --> 10:46.099
Hey, you.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.168
(Mare snorts and grunts)

10:51.306 --> 10:54.107
(Foal whinnies
in the distance)

10:54.175 --> 10:55.275
It's coming
from over there.

10:55.343 --> 10:58.411
(High-pitched whinny
in the distance)

11:00.447 --> 11:02.148
(High-pitched whinny)

11:04.985 --> 11:05.918
Poor thing.

11:06.886 --> 11:08.655
(High-pitched whinny)

11:12.271 --> 11:13.738
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>You're okay.</i>

11:16.809 --> 11:17.976
(Foal grunts)

11:18.044 --> 11:19.744
- It's a trapper's snare.
- Yeah. Easy...

11:19.812 --> 11:22.981
Ranchers use them
to catch wild horses.

11:23.049 --> 11:25.749
It's okay, little guy.
You're okay.

11:25.817 --> 11:26.750
(Foal grunts)

11:26.818 --> 11:29.186
Easy, easy.
Easy, easy.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.121
How does it look?

11:31.189 --> 11:34.624
It's not good.
It's already infected.

11:34.693 --> 11:35.759
I'd like to treat him,

11:35.827 --> 11:36.660
but I feel like
if I cut this off,

11:36.728 --> 11:38.461
he's gonna bolt.

11:38.529 --> 11:41.165
What if I hold him
while you have a look at it?

11:41.232 --> 11:43.966
How are you gonna
do that?

11:47.137 --> 11:50.473
(Leaves and branches rustle
as Ty pulls on rope)

11:51.742 --> 11:53.210
Amy:
Good boy...

11:53.277 --> 11:54.311
Thank you.

11:57.515 --> 11:59.315
<i>Amy: You got him?</i>
<i>Ty: Yup.</i>

11:59.382 --> 12:01.250
- Good.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:01.318 --> 12:03.051
Good boy.

12:03.119 --> 12:04.453
(Foal grunts and snorts)

12:04.521 --> 12:06.488
Amy: I know, I know.
Ty: Easy, easy, easy.

12:08.425 --> 12:10.926
Amy: There you go.
There you go. Good boy.

12:11.894 --> 12:13.629
Okay.

12:13.697 --> 12:15.129
I'll cut off the rope.

12:15.197 --> 12:16.364
(Soothingly)
Good boy.

12:17.333 --> 12:18.600
You're okay.
Good boy.

12:21.870 --> 12:23.271
- Good boy.
- You're free, little one.

12:23.339 --> 12:24.939
(Whinnies wildly)
Easy!

12:25.006 --> 12:29.677
It's okay.
What a good boy. Easy...

12:29.745 --> 12:31.645
Here you go.

12:31.713 --> 12:33.347
Get that off you.

12:33.414 --> 12:34.648
<i>(Mare whinnies nearby)</i>
<i>Good boy.</i>

12:42.022 --> 12:43.657
- Hold him.
- You're okay.

12:43.725 --> 12:44.725
You're okay.

12:47.494 --> 12:48.527
You know, Jack,

12:48.595 --> 12:50.062
I just want you to know
that uh...

12:50.130 --> 12:52.465
I completely understand that
Georgie's current behaviour

12:52.532 --> 12:54.567
isn't indicative
of your relationship.

12:54.635 --> 12:55.834
I mean,
she's like any kid,

12:55.902 --> 12:57.169
she's upset at the change
in plans.

12:57.237 --> 12:59.405
Well, I'm glad to hear you
say that, Clint,

12:59.473 --> 13:03.040
because that's exactly
how I look at it.

13:03.108 --> 13:04.909
Thank you. But I do have
to warn you though

13:04.977 --> 13:06.844
that these next few questions
are vital,

13:06.912 --> 13:08.413
so I'm not gonna
beat around the bush.

13:08.481 --> 13:09.447
Jack:
Shoot!

13:09.515 --> 13:10.749
Do you think you can cope

13:10.816 --> 13:12.384
with an additional member
of the family?

13:12.451 --> 13:14.519
Well, I've been coping,
haven't I?

13:14.587 --> 13:18.222
Well, yes. Yes, Jack,
but what about backup?

13:18.290 --> 13:20.023
What if you were
incapacitated?

13:20.091 --> 13:21.325
What if you had
to go away?

13:21.393 --> 13:22.559
Who's gonna take Georgie
to school?

13:22.627 --> 13:24.127
Who's gonna be here
when she comes home?

13:24.195 --> 13:25.962
What if she runs away
again?

13:26.030 --> 13:28.666
I got lots of backup, Clint.

13:28.733 --> 13:31.001
That's the beautiful thing
about family,

13:31.068 --> 13:32.803
Lou, especially.

13:32.870 --> 13:36.005
She's gonna be a huge help.
She is so organized-

13:36.072 --> 13:38.274
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Okay, so now we are not
going</i> <i>to the dude ranch!</i>

13:38.342 --> 13:40.376
Katie has a temperature.

13:40.444 --> 13:43.579
Grandpa, have you seen
Katie's medicine?

13:43.647 --> 13:45.014
If things could stay
on an even keel around here

13:45.081 --> 13:47.583
even for one day -
you know, one day! -

13:47.651 --> 13:50.452
that is all that I'm asking.
(Bangs cupboard doors shut)

13:50.520 --> 13:52.153
(Sighs, frustrated)

13:54.223 --> 13:55.657
Of course,
it is perfectly natural

13:55.725 --> 13:57.391
for a baby to get sick.

13:57.459 --> 13:58.726
I mean, pfft!

13:58.794 --> 14:00.127
At least she's not
in daycare anymore.

14:00.195 --> 14:02.563
What is daycare but a haven
for festering germs -

14:02.631 --> 14:03.798
and lice!

14:03.865 --> 14:05.098
Clint:
So your baby was in daycare?

14:05.166 --> 14:07.335
Yes, but now I have quit
my job in Calgary.

14:07.402 --> 14:08.902
Oh! So you're at home?

14:08.970 --> 14:10.538
Yeah.
I'm starting my own business.

14:10.605 --> 14:12.005
Huh. Really.

14:12.073 --> 14:13.740
<i>Good for you.</i>
<i>Uh, and your husband?</i>

14:13.808 --> 14:15.908
Oh, he has a super job.

14:15.976 --> 14:17.310
In Vancouver,
I understand.

14:18.245 --> 14:20.313
Yes. But he goes back
and forth...

14:20.381 --> 14:22.515
Back mostly... here.

14:22.583 --> 14:23.616
Back here.

14:25.853 --> 14:29.355
An absentee husband,
a new job and a baby?

14:29.422 --> 14:32.023
That's a bit of a juggling act,
wouldn't you say?

14:32.091 --> 14:35.026
Lou: No. No!
He's not absentee. It's...

14:36.128 --> 14:38.029
He's fine.
It's fine.

14:38.097 --> 14:39.931
<i>(Katie starts crying)</i>
<i>We're fine.</i>

14:39.999 --> 14:41.500
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Lou, she's throwing up!</i>

14:41.568 --> 14:43.769
I'm coming!
It's all good.

14:49.174 --> 14:52.443
Wow. He really struggled
against this thing.

14:52.511 --> 14:55.780
It's a miracle
he didn't choke himself.

14:55.848 --> 14:58.583
It's okay, boy.
You're all right.

14:59.485 --> 15:01.185
This is really infected.

15:01.253 --> 15:03.253
I'm gonna have
to flush it out.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.988
Did you bring your vet case?

15:05.055 --> 15:06.990
No.
I left it at home.

15:07.057 --> 15:08.324
There's a first aid kit
in the truck.

15:08.393 --> 15:09.760
I could go get it.

15:09.827 --> 15:10.994
Okay, but we're gonna need
some fresh water

15:11.061 --> 15:12.295
to flush out the wound.

15:12.363 --> 15:14.964
There's... there's a pump
back at camp.

15:15.032 --> 15:16.299
(Horse whinnies wildly,
snorts nervously)

15:16.367 --> 15:19.869
Easy! How are we gonna
get him there, Amy?

15:19.936 --> 15:21.704
We've done it before.

15:23.874 --> 15:25.307
You ready?

15:25.375 --> 15:27.676
Yeah. Yeah, I think
this is gonna work.

15:27.744 --> 15:29.211
Okay.

15:29.279 --> 15:30.679
Amy:
Come on you.

15:31.948 --> 15:32.981
<i>Come on.</i>

15:33.049 --> 15:34.348
(Horse snorts
and whinnies)

15:34.417 --> 15:35.349
Amy: I know.
Ty: There we go.

15:35.418 --> 15:36.418
Amy:
Good boy.

15:40.322 --> 15:42.056
(High-pitched whinny)

15:42.124 --> 15:43.758
Amy:
You're okay.

15:43.826 --> 15:47.662
Lou: You're gonna be all
better soon, okay? Yeah...

15:48.864 --> 15:50.230
Georgie:
What's wrong?

15:50.298 --> 15:52.198
She has a fever.

15:52.266 --> 15:56.369
The cool water helps bring
her temperature down.

15:57.405 --> 16:00.073
Georgie:
Hey, Katie... hi!

16:00.141 --> 16:02.443
Does that feel nice?
Does that feel nice?

16:02.510 --> 16:06.212
Hmm? Look it!
Ducky likes it too.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.713
Quack-quack!
Quack-quack!

16:07.781 --> 16:09.515
(Katie giggles and squeals)

16:09.583 --> 16:11.251
Yeah! Quack-quack!
Quack quack!

16:11.319 --> 16:12.518
(Laughs)

16:15.556 --> 16:16.722
<i>You know, sometimes things</i>
<i>don't work out</i>

16:16.790 --> 16:19.326
the way that we want them to,

16:19.393 --> 16:21.861
and you can either
accept it or...

16:21.929 --> 16:24.330
I'm never speaking
to Jack again.

16:24.397 --> 16:25.431
...or not.

16:28.668 --> 16:30.336
But I'm glad you're here,

16:31.271 --> 16:34.039
and I think Katie's glad
you're here too.

16:34.107 --> 16:35.540
Aren't you, Katie?

16:35.608 --> 16:37.142
<i>Yes! Yes we are.</i>

16:38.077 --> 16:40.078
(Katie coos and squeals,
screen door bangs shut)

16:40.145 --> 16:41.245
Peter:
No. Yeah.

16:41.313 --> 16:43.214
Dom, I can't meet
with you tonight.

16:43.282 --> 16:44.882
Because I got a baby
with a fever of 102

16:44.950 --> 16:47.385
and my wife needs my help,
that's why.

16:47.453 --> 16:49.587
Okay, fine.
Yeah. Tomorrow.

16:49.654 --> 16:50.688
First thing, yes.

16:50.755 --> 16:52.790
Goodbye.
(Phone beeps off)

16:52.858 --> 16:54.624
I can't believe this guy,
honestly!

16:54.692 --> 16:56.093
Somehow there's a problem
with the wiring.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.361
He told me his electrician
was licensed,

16:57.428 --> 17:00.263
but guess what?
Surprise! He's not.

17:00.331 --> 17:03.233
We'll be lucky to get in there
by Christmas.

17:03.301 --> 17:05.102
Jack: Hey!
You want me to make you something?

17:05.169 --> 17:06.935
You didn't have lunch.

17:07.005 --> 17:08.905
(Fridge door bangs shut,
Georgie huffs angrily)

17:08.973 --> 17:10.271
Do you have a moment
to talk to me?

17:10.339 --> 17:11.839
About what?

17:11.907 --> 17:15.844
Oh, life, how you're doing,
that sort of thing.

17:15.912 --> 17:18.114
I don't have a life.

17:20.282 --> 17:21.617
Sure, I'll talk.
Why not?

17:24.253 --> 17:25.554
(Horse whinnies
and snorts)

17:25.622 --> 17:27.021
Ty:
Easy, easy...

17:27.923 --> 17:30.758
I wish I had a local anesthetic
to dull the pain,

17:30.826 --> 17:33.561
that way he wouldn't be
so jumpy.

17:33.629 --> 17:36.631
Amy: Well, my mom used to
make a tea using willow bark.

17:36.698 --> 17:37.999
Willow bark?

17:38.067 --> 17:40.001
Yeah. She'd sweeten it
with apple juice

17:40.069 --> 17:41.602
so the horses
would drink it.

17:41.670 --> 17:42.536
<i>But she swore it was</i>
<i>the best thing</i>

17:42.603 --> 17:44.171
<i>to dull any pain.</i>

17:44.239 --> 17:45.572
Well, it couldn't hurt.

17:45.640 --> 17:46.806
He's probably
pretty hungry too.

17:46.874 --> 17:49.143
He's definitely too young
to be weaned.

17:49.210 --> 17:51.245
Well, can you handle him
while I go look for some?

17:51.312 --> 17:52.346
Yeah.

17:55.683 --> 17:56.716
Okay...

18:01.255 --> 18:02.455
(Horse snorts)

18:08.895 --> 18:11.197
(Birds chirp,
tack jingles)

18:20.639 --> 18:21.839
(Bush rustles)

18:24.643 --> 18:27.145
(Wild horses whinny
and snort)

18:41.993 --> 18:43.394
<i>Hey, girl...</i>

18:44.762 --> 18:46.329
Your baby's hungry.

18:47.298 --> 18:48.965
You wanna come feed him?

18:49.900 --> 18:51.767
I can take you to him,
hmm?

18:51.835 --> 18:53.869
(Horses grunt and neigh)

18:55.439 --> 18:56.439
Hey...

19:07.016 --> 19:08.484
Clint:
You feel good living here?

19:08.551 --> 19:11.153
Yeah.
I like the horses.

19:11.221 --> 19:12.421
Clint:
Just the horses?

19:12.489 --> 19:14.923
How are you and Jack
getting along?

19:14.991 --> 19:16.791
Oh, well,

19:16.859 --> 19:18.859
okay, maybe you're not too crazy
about him today,

19:18.927 --> 19:20.328
but the rest of the time?

19:20.395 --> 19:21.596
He's all right.

19:22.964 --> 19:24.165
When you first got here,

19:24.233 --> 19:26.567
you said you thought
he was "cool".

19:26.635 --> 19:29.069
He's cool
when he keeps his promises,

19:29.138 --> 19:32.106
and I guess he was pretty cool
when I fell down the well.

19:32.174 --> 19:34.941
What?
You fell down a well?

19:35.009 --> 19:37.110
Yeah.
It was pretty awesome.

19:37.178 --> 19:38.512
Awesome?

19:38.579 --> 19:41.748
Yeah. I was saving
a stray dog.

19:41.815 --> 19:45.185
Uh, Georgina,
how deep was this well?

19:45.253 --> 19:50.623
Um... I don't know...
Like as deep as that.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.757
<i>Clint:</i>
<i>What, that windmill?</i>

19:51.824 --> 19:53.125
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>

19:53.193 --> 19:54.760
He had to set up
some sort of winch thing.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.029
I came up
in a sort of sling.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.764
It was really cool.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.100
(Chuckles) Cool.
Cool.

20:03.537 --> 20:08.139
Uh... look, where was Jack
when you fell in the well?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.542
Uh, he was at home.
It wasn't his fault.

20:10.609 --> 20:13.645
He didn't know
I'd taken off.

20:13.712 --> 20:17.014
Yeah, well,
maybe he should have.

20:22.725 --> 20:23.959
<i>Lisa:</i>
<i>Hello!</i>

20:26.612 --> 20:28.013
Hey!

20:28.080 --> 20:29.348
Oh!

20:30.280 --> 20:31.248
Hi.

20:32.351 --> 20:34.519
It's so good to see you.

20:34.586 --> 20:36.820
I... I came to see Lou

20:36.888 --> 20:39.589
about some dude ranch
business.

20:39.657 --> 20:40.690
Oh.

20:41.759 --> 20:42.993
I didn't expect
to see you.

20:43.061 --> 20:45.529
She said you were away
for the weekend.

20:45.596 --> 20:48.999
Well, I'm here
and so are you,

20:49.067 --> 20:51.067
um, so maybe we can...

20:54.838 --> 20:57.506
Clint,
this is Lisa Stillman.

20:57.574 --> 20:59.275
Lisa: Hi. How are you?
Clint: Hello.

20:59.343 --> 21:01.644
I'm uh...
Is Lou here?

21:02.646 --> 21:04.613
She's in the nursery.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.382
Your goddaughter's running
a temperature.

21:06.450 --> 21:07.649
Oh no,
that's too bad.

21:07.716 --> 21:09.517
Well, then I will,
uh, go see them.

21:09.585 --> 21:10.986
Excuse me.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.425
That's my... lady friend.

21:17.393 --> 21:20.562
We've been seeing each other
for some time.

21:21.664 --> 21:22.964
Clint:
Well, that's good.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.232
A stable relationship;
That's very good, Jack.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.733
It's all about backup.

21:27.669 --> 21:29.236
(Whispering)
Grandpa, I am sorry!

21:29.304 --> 21:30.204
I completely forgot
to tell you

21:30.272 --> 21:32.073
Lisa was coming!

21:32.140 --> 21:33.807
Awkward!

21:33.875 --> 21:35.809
I really should've
warned you.

21:35.877 --> 21:38.012
Anyway, you know,
Katie's throwing up

21:38.080 --> 21:40.680
and I have to go change
her sheets.

21:44.318 --> 21:48.121
<i>(Water gurgles as it's drawn</i>
<i>from a pump)</i>

21:48.189 --> 21:49.456
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Found some!</i>

21:49.523 --> 21:51.157
Great!

21:51.225 --> 21:52.625
Can I use that water
to boil them in?

21:52.693 --> 21:55.461
Ty: Yeah. That's what I'm
getting it ready for.

21:55.528 --> 21:56.761
Amy:
So...

21:56.829 --> 22:00.032
I saw the herd.
The mare was with them.

22:00.100 --> 22:01.500
I think she knows
we have her baby.

22:01.567 --> 22:02.534
Huh.

22:02.602 --> 22:05.371
Just making
some bandages here.

22:05.438 --> 22:08.173
- With Stumpy's bed sheets?
- Yeah.

22:08.241 --> 22:09.574
He's gonna love you.

22:09.642 --> 22:11.209
(Laughs,
sheets rip)

22:13.945 --> 22:16.680
Peter: Hey, you.
What's going on?

22:18.550 --> 22:21.619
Katie threw up
all over her bed.

22:21.686 --> 22:23.054
I know. I heard.

22:24.189 --> 22:25.591
(Sighs)

22:26.089 --> 22:28.191
Too bad about
that camping trip, huh?

22:28.259 --> 22:30.593
I know you were really
looking forward to it.

22:30.661 --> 22:32.262
Lou and I were too.

22:32.330 --> 22:34.597
So you could have the place
to yourself?

22:34.665 --> 22:35.600
(Laughs)

22:36.265 --> 22:37.500
Uh...Yes!

22:39.203 --> 22:43.272
I guess we both got Clint
to thank for that, huh?

22:43.340 --> 22:46.409
I think I messed
things up.

22:46.476 --> 22:48.277
What things?

22:48.345 --> 22:50.046
I know why he's here.

22:50.113 --> 22:51.680
He's not just here
to chat.

22:51.748 --> 22:54.750
He's here on
a "routine assessment"

22:54.817 --> 22:57.553
of my "temporary
living arrangements."

22:57.620 --> 22:59.954
It's not like I haven't been
through this before.

23:02.391 --> 23:04.825
Yeah,
I guess not, huh?

23:08.064 --> 23:10.965
Well... why do you think
you messed up?

23:13.202 --> 23:16.570
Well... I said something
I shouldn't have.

23:21.476 --> 23:22.943
I never know what to say,

23:23.010 --> 23:26.447
'cause I never know
what they wanna hear.

23:34.088 --> 23:37.590
(Birds sing,
insects buzz)

23:41.161 --> 23:42.228
Okay...

23:47.467 --> 23:48.800
Damn.
What?

23:49.868 --> 23:51.736
See this?
That's more pus.

23:51.837 --> 23:54.539
Have to wash
it out again

23:54.640 --> 23:56.141
okay, I'll hold him.

23:56.209 --> 23:58.176
Be careful.
Don't get kicked.

24:00.146 --> 24:01.346
Don't you dare
kick me!

24:01.447 --> 24:03.447
Foal grunts,
mare whinnies nearby.

24:20.364 --> 24:22.332
(Gentle thud of hooves)

24:28.939 --> 24:32.142
She followed you here.
That's amazing.

24:33.677 --> 24:36.911
(Foal and mare grunt, snort
and whinny)

24:43.953 --> 24:45.987
(Grunting and snorting)

24:49.725 --> 24:51.759
(Mare and foal whinny)

24:56.498 --> 24:59.099
Her foal's still
really hungry.

25:00.802 --> 25:03.103
There we go,
nice and fresh.

25:04.072 --> 25:05.473
Thank you.

25:07.341 --> 25:08.775
(Sighs) I wish...

25:08.842 --> 25:11.344
I wish you'd told me
Jack was gonna be here.

25:11.412 --> 25:13.112
I'm sorry.

25:13.181 --> 25:14.847
It's okay.

25:14.915 --> 25:16.583
It's okay.
It's just hard.

25:16.651 --> 25:17.717
I know.

25:19.119 --> 25:20.287
What happened?

25:20.354 --> 25:22.055
France happened.

25:22.122 --> 25:23.255
What do you mean?
You guys had a great time.

25:23.323 --> 25:25.391
I had a great time,
he didn't.

25:25.458 --> 25:27.526
He said he did,
but he didn't.

25:27.594 --> 25:28.960
I shouldn't have
made him go.

25:29.028 --> 25:32.731
Well, you didn't make him go.
He chose to go.

25:32.799 --> 25:36.735
Just seeing him is kind of...
(Tearing up) hard.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.908
Oh Lisa, I'm sorry.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.873
(Crying)
I miss him.

25:44.176 --> 25:45.643
I miss him a lot.

25:45.711 --> 25:46.611
You know,
I didn't even realize

25:46.679 --> 25:48.513
you felt that way,

25:48.581 --> 25:51.216
especially since you and Dan
are back together.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.150
What? Dan?

25:54.220 --> 25:55.652
Well you are,
aren't you?

25:55.720 --> 25:59.389
No! Does he think Dan
and I are together?

26:00.325 --> 26:03.126
Where did he get
that idea?

26:06.997 --> 26:10.767
Why in the world do you think
I'm back together with Dan?

26:10.835 --> 26:11.901
Lou:
Can I just say something?

26:11.969 --> 26:13.703
Jack:
Clint, would you mind...?

26:13.771 --> 26:15.138
No. Absolutely.

26:19.043 --> 26:21.644
Okay, Grandpa,
Lisa...

26:21.712 --> 26:25.215
Jack: You see, I'm not that
surprised, to be honest with you.

26:25.282 --> 26:27.183
You spent all that time
in France

26:27.251 --> 26:29.184
on "business" together,

26:29.252 --> 26:30.652
and now, apparently,

26:30.720 --> 26:33.622
you're "pooling
your resources."

26:33.689 --> 26:36.158
Those are his words,
not mine.

26:36.226 --> 26:40.362
Nothing says serious like
"pooling your resources"!

26:40.429 --> 26:42.831
I'm not "pooling my resources"
with Dan!

26:42.899 --> 26:44.866
If he said that,
he is seriously mistaken.

26:44.933 --> 26:47.635
It was just something
Dan mentioned to me,

26:47.702 --> 26:49.436
and I'm sorry if...

26:50.372 --> 26:51.806
Well, the fact that
you would believe him

26:51.874 --> 26:53.607
instead of asking me
is just as bad.

26:53.675 --> 26:57.979
You're gonna sit there
and stew over nothing?

27:01.149 --> 27:02.115
(Door opens)

27:02.183 --> 27:03.750
Grandpa,
I am so sorry.

27:13.995 --> 27:17.663
There you go.
Huh? Yeah.

27:18.965 --> 27:21.300
He's liking
the willow tea.

27:21.367 --> 27:22.534
That a boy!

27:22.602 --> 27:24.736
Now we'll be able
to get at that cut.

27:24.805 --> 27:26.238
You know there's this poultice
you can make

27:26.306 --> 27:29.374
using honey, olive oil...
and ground-up charcoal.

27:29.442 --> 27:31.476
It helps it heal faster.

27:31.544 --> 27:32.877
Well, there's charcoal
in that fire pit.

27:32.945 --> 27:36.247
And... I brought olive oil
for the steaks,

27:36.315 --> 27:37.849
<i>(In unison)</i> <i>And there's
honey</i> <i>for breakfast!</i>

No, he's not gone.

29:44.135 --> 29:46.303
He's in the barn office
making some calls.

29:46.370 --> 29:48.305
Private, he says.

29:54.278 --> 29:56.178
What's the problem?

29:56.246 --> 29:57.612
The interview.

29:58.548 --> 30:00.882
Everything that could go wrong
went wrong.

30:00.951 --> 30:02.584
It was like it
was destined to fail

30:02.652 --> 30:04.018
right from the start.

30:04.086 --> 30:06.387
Well, I'd be lying
if I said I'm not relieved.

30:06.455 --> 30:08.556
That's fine.
I knew you would be.

30:08.623 --> 30:11.059
That's not what I mean, Jack.

30:12.161 --> 30:14.128
I'm thinking about you.

30:16.165 --> 30:20.200
I'm thinking about you
and the kid down the line.

30:20.268 --> 30:22.102
I'm not in the ground yet, Tim.

30:22.170 --> 30:23.736
I don't intend to be
real soon.

30:23.804 --> 30:25.238
I'm not saying that.

30:25.306 --> 30:27.207
Jack: I could've done
a lot for that kid.

30:27.275 --> 30:30.010
I'd like to think that...

30:30.945 --> 30:32.812
That I could've made
a difference in her life -

30:32.880 --> 30:34.414
a big difference.

Hey. How's the interview going?

31:07.312 --> 31:09.579
Clint: Oh...
that's, that's confidential -

31:09.647 --> 31:11.415
confidential information, Tim.

31:11.483 --> 31:13.150
I know...
I know I wasn't on board

31:13.218 --> 31:14.651
for this whole arrangement
at first,

31:14.719 --> 31:18.055
but... I-I feel for Jack.

31:18.990 --> 31:21.425
You got the guy
on tenterhooks here.

31:21.493 --> 31:23.559

What are his chances?

31:25.962 --> 31:27.196
I don't know.

31:28.065 --> 31:30.033
I mean, frankly,
I'm a bit surprised.

31:30.100 --> 31:31.700
About what?

31:31.768 --> 31:34.137
Well, look at what
an amazing job

31:34.204 --> 31:36.172
- Jack did with Ty.
- Right.

31:36.240 --> 31:37.573
But now...

31:37.641 --> 31:38.941
I mean I think things
might have changed.

31:39.009 --> 31:40.108
I mean,
people do get older.

31:40.176 --> 31:41.410
Come on!

31:41.477 --> 31:43.711
Jack is doing an amazing job
with that kid.

31:43.779 --> 31:46.214
The other day,
Jack takes Georgie out,

31:46.282 --> 31:49.484
teaches her how to drive cattle
within an hour - one hour!

31:49.552 --> 31:51.686
With no experience whatsoever,

31:51.754 --> 31:53.855
she's just diving right in there
with the steers,

31:53.923 --> 31:56.123
driving the herd.
(Laughs)

31:56.191 --> 31:57.558
Oh! And I almost forgot!

31:57.625 --> 31:59.260
The other day, he's teaching her
to drive the tractor.

31:59.327 --> 32:00.794
Little Georgie up there
in the big tractor.

32:00.862 --> 32:02.229
Those things can be
dangerous.

32:02.297 --> 32:04.498
She...
She's gonna be a big help.

32:04.566 --> 32:07.968
She's like...
One of the hired hands.

an amazing experience like that?

32:13.107 --> 32:14.307

"'without question, '
said Rosamunde."

32:48.173 --> 32:50.808
Her temperature's down.

32:50.875 --> 32:53.978
Thank you for helping me
with Katie.

32:54.045 --> 32:56.214
It's really sweet of you
to read her a story.

32:56.281 --> 32:59.816
She's so cute,
even when she's throwing up.

32:59.883 --> 33:02.752
(Laughs) I know.
Poor little thing.

33:02.820 --> 33:05.788
I always wanted
a little sister.

33:05.856 --> 33:09.792
Every family I've been in,
I've always been the youngest.

33:09.860 --> 33:12.429
How many families
have you been with?

33:12.497 --> 33:14.131
I don't know...
A lot.

33:15.766 --> 33:17.500
And your parents?

33:17.567 --> 33:20.069
I mean...
What happened to them?

33:20.137 --> 33:21.971
They died.
Car accident.

33:25.843 --> 33:27.476
How old were you?

33:27.544 --> 33:29.545
Three.
I don't really remember.

33:32.581 --> 33:33.882
Katie probably won't remember

33:33.950 --> 33:36.151
when she moves
into her new place.

33:37.386 --> 33:39.320
Do you think
she'll like it?

33:39.388 --> 33:41.023
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>Who wouldn't?</i>

33:41.090 --> 33:43.191
I love the swing
and the barn.

33:43.259 --> 33:47.462
I'd never been in a barn
until I came here.

33:47.530 --> 33:51.065
Yours is pretty cool,
especially the loft.

33:51.133 --> 33:53.868
It feels safe...
Like a nest.

33:56.004 --> 33:57.805
Hey, I have an idea.

33:57.873 --> 34:00.507
How about I make
your favourite dinner?

34:00.575 --> 34:02.242
Roast chicken?

34:02.310 --> 34:04.744
With new potatoes?
You got it.

34:05.846 --> 34:07.580
Why don't you go
and pick some more veggies

34:07.648 --> 34:08.915
from the garden,
okay?

34:08.983 --> 34:10.016
Sure.

34:12.418 --> 34:13.953
Clint: There seems to
be some dysfunction

34:14.021 --> 34:17.290
between the potential parent
and child.

34:17.357 --> 34:20.926
There was the issue
of falling down a well,

34:20.994 --> 34:23.929
and his relationships seem to be
on rather shaky ground.

34:23.996 --> 34:26.098
(Screen door creaks open)

34:28.367 --> 34:32.571
Look, Clint, this has been
a really bad day, and...

34:32.638 --> 34:33.806
(Chuckles)

34:33.873 --> 34:34.940
Maybe you should come back

34:35.007 --> 34:36.440
after things have
settled down a bit

34:36.507 --> 34:39.210
and we can try this
interview again.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.679
Uh, well, you know I'd love
to do that, Jack,

34:41.746 --> 34:43.880
but I can't.
It's policy.

34:43.949 --> 34:45.817
Policy...

34:45.884 --> 34:49.053
Clint, I just want to be
Georgie's foster parent.

34:49.121 --> 34:50.521
<i>I'm in for the long haul,</i>

34:50.589 --> 34:52.723
<i>but I need you</i>
<i>to make this happen.</i>

34:52.790 --> 34:56.860
Clint: Well, I'll do what
I can, you know that,

34:57.795 --> 35:01.397
but, Jack,
I can't work miracles.

35:01.465 --> 35:04.201
So it doesn't look good.

35:04.268 --> 35:07.037
<i>Clint:</i>
<i>No, Jack, it doesn't.</i>

35:10.073 --> 35:11.240
Jack:
You know, Clint,

35:11.307 --> 35:14.110
I'm trying not to put you
on the spot here,

35:14.177 --> 35:15.845
but you know how I feel.

35:15.912 --> 35:17.512
I just wanna do what I can
for Georgie...

35:34.452 --> 35:36.020
<i>(Recording)</i> <i>There seems to be

35:46.932 --> 35:48.433
(Loud knock)

35:48.932 --> 35:50.033
Dinner's ready.

35:50.101 --> 35:52.336
Okay.
I'll be right there.

35:56.107 --> 35:57.207
(Phone beeps off)

35:57.275 --> 35:58.409
Jack:
Well, that was Clint.

35:58.477 --> 36:00.177
He's wondering
if we found his phone.

36:00.245 --> 36:01.846
He thinks he left it here.
Anybody see it?

36:01.913 --> 36:02.847
I haven't seen it.

36:02.914 --> 36:05.248
Well,
I hope he has lost it.

36:06.183 --> 36:09.686
(Quietly) Hey. I uh...
I want you to know

36:09.754 --> 36:11.421
that I spoke to Clint
on your behalf.

36:11.489 --> 36:13.490
(Forceful whisper)
Why did you go and do that?!

36:13.557 --> 36:15.124
Because I know how important
it is to you,

36:15.192 --> 36:17.293
and you're right.
You're right.

36:17.361 --> 36:18.395
Look how it turned out
for Shane,

36:18.462 --> 36:19.728
and you helped me
with that.

36:19.796 --> 36:21.296
So, now, it's my turn
to help you.

36:21.364 --> 36:22.765
No. Just please don't.

36:22.832 --> 36:25.434
I'm making points
with Clint.

36:26.403 --> 36:27.969
Thank me later.

36:30.573 --> 36:33.942
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Oh, those smell so good!
</i> <i>I'm starving.</i>

36:34.010 --> 36:36.010
How are the potatoes coming?

36:36.077 --> 36:38.880
Ty: I think they should
be done, actually.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.915
Let's check here.

36:42.818 --> 36:44.318
Ow! Whoa! That is hot!

36:45.421 --> 36:46.186
(Laughing)
Are you okay?

36:46.254 --> 36:47.221
Yeah, I'm fine!
I'm fine!

36:47.289 --> 36:48.322
I'm tough!
I'm okay, I'm okay.

36:48.390 --> 36:49.424
Oh yeah,
you are tough.

36:49.491 --> 36:51.191
I am tough.
I'm fine.

36:51.259 --> 36:52.526
Maybe on the outside,

36:52.593 --> 36:54.828
but you're a big marshmallow
inside.

36:54.896 --> 36:56.296
I am not a marshmallow. Oh!

36:56.363 --> 36:59.198
Yes, you are!
Marshmallow! Marshmallow!

36:59.266 --> 37:00.734
(Laughing)
Hey, no fair! No fair!

37:00.802 --> 37:03.637
No! Ah? See?

(Laughing)

37:18.418 --> 37:20.953
You see?
You are a marshmallow.

37:22.722 --> 37:24.756
Yeah, maybe.

Ty: Oh!
Amy: Here.

37:33.365 --> 37:34.599

Good night, Jack.

38:08.031 --> 38:11.133
So you're talking to me again,
are you?

38:11.201 --> 38:14.236
I gotta say
that feels pretty good.

38:25.548 --> 38:26.948
Maybe, even tomorrow,

38:27.017 --> 38:29.550
we'll saddle up the horses
and we'll go for a ride.

38:29.618 --> 38:31.486
(Stifling tears)
Yeah.

38:37.559 --> 38:40.728

Good night.

Night.

Ty:
Yeah. Much calmer.

Amy: You did a really great job.
Scott would be proud.

40:11.118 --> 40:13.286
Thank you.
We make a good team.

40:13.354 --> 40:15.121
- We do!
- Yeah?

I'm so proud of you
for starting vet school.

40:19.860 --> 40:21.961
Well, it's only
because of you, Amy.

Come on.

No. It's true.

your encouragement.

Wow.
