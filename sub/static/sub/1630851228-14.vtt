on a diplomatic passport.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.492

that Mr. Gregory

03:10.146 --> 03:12.757
is the senior administrative
aide to the attorney general,

03:12.801 --> 03:14.498
Rebecca Blair.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.892
- Attorney General Blair has
been traveling across Europe

03:16.935 --> 03:19.895
as part of a public relations
tour to show cooperation

03:19.938 --> 03:21.244

it was a last minute addition

may very well be an accident

or suicide,
but until we can rule out

03:40.481 --> 03:42.352

we are gonna assume the worst.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.245
- We got something for you,
all right.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.682
So I found a room
near the hotel

19:21.725 --> 19:24.163
that was rented
for the exact two days

19:24.206 --> 19:25.773
using an IP address
in the Middle East.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.949
Now, it was booked
under a fake name.

19:27.992 --> 19:30.125
But Agent Harmon was able
to backtrack the financials

19:30.169 --> 19:32.171
and linked the payment
to a corporate credit card

19:32.214 --> 19:35.435
from a military contractor
known as Briesen Dynamics.

19:35.478 --> 19:36.610
Now, the company told us

19:36.653 --> 19:38.786
not only
is their credit card missing,

19:38.829 --> 19:41.354
so is one of their employees.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.660
It's Mia Sahar.
She's 27 years old,

19:43.704 --> 19:46.968
a U.S. citizen who, until
recently, worked in logistics

19:47.011 --> 19:48.752
for Briesen in Afghanistan.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.667
- Nice work, you two.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.280
- Tell them
about the other thing.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.020
- A search of her social media

19:56.064 --> 19:58.153
popped up this message
in Pashto.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.158
That refers to
a classified report

20:03.202 --> 20:06.161
provided by a prisoner being
unjustly held in Budapest.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.381
- This is the link
we've been looking for.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.165
Looks like
she's getting instructions

20:10.209 --> 20:12.428
from that prisoner
to intimidate the AG

20:12.472 --> 20:14.387
in hopes of preventing
his extradition.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.476
- If the attorney general
isn't backing down

20:16.519 --> 20:19.218
after a staff member
was killed...

20:19.261 --> 20:22.221
an attempt on the AG
could be a logical next step.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.310
- I wanna talk
to that prisoner--now.

20:26.921 --> 20:28.749
- Given the connection
to your case

20:28.792 --> 20:30.141
and the potential threat,

20:30.185 --> 20:32.318
I have no choice but to
allow you to question him.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.189
- Thank you, my friend.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.713
- Between us, however,
I have to warn you.

20:36.757 --> 20:39.325
If you're expecting some kind
of a criminal mastermind,

20:39.368 --> 20:41.718
you may be disappointed.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.372
John Mallory
is a civilian analyst

20:43.416 --> 20:45.809
for the
U.S. Department of Defense,

20:45.853 --> 20:48.334
and my country insists
he be treated fairly.

20:48.377 --> 20:49.944
- Why wouldn't he be?

20:49.987 --> 20:53.252
- Because despite what your
attorney general may tell you,

20:53.295 --> 20:56.429
his only crime appears to be
trying to release a report

20:56.472 --> 20:59.997
that would be, well,
quite embarrassing politically

21:00.041 --> 21:01.912
for the American government.

21:11.095 --> 21:13.010
This man is not a traitor.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.058
He's a whistleblower.

21:17.101 --> 21:20.191
[dramatic music]

21:25.675 --> 21:27.764
- So that's the AG's
new plan to discredit me--

21:27.808 --> 21:29.766
have the FBI frame me
for murder?

21:29.810 --> 21:31.768
- We're not asking on behalf
of the attorney general.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.857
She doesn't even know
we're here.

21:33.901 --> 21:36.599
- The DOJ has done nothing
but twist my words around,

21:36.643 --> 21:37.992
and now
I'm supposed to trust you?

21:38.035 --> 21:39.559
- We're giving you a chance
to tell your story.

21:39.602 --> 21:40.821
Isn't that what you want?

21:40.864 --> 21:42.605
- If my request for asylum
is granted,

21:42.649 --> 21:44.303
I'll be able to speak out
as I please.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.043
- But if it's not...

21:46.087 --> 21:48.350
this may be your last chance.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.787
- And if you are being
silenced, as you claim,

21:50.831 --> 21:54.051
tell us why, and maybe
we can help each other.

21:54.095 --> 21:56.489
- Ask Blair about the list.

21:56.532 --> 21:57.707
- What list?

22:00.536 --> 22:02.538
- When we pulled troops
out of Afghanistan,

22:02.582 --> 22:05.324
the DOD made a list of all
the Afghans who assisted us--

22:05.367 --> 22:07.978
translators, guides, everybody
who needed to be evacuated.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.893
- In fear of retribution
from the Taliban.

22:09.937 --> 22:11.982
- Right.
Well, imagine my surprise

22:12.026 --> 22:14.376
when I read an internal
accountability report

22:14.420 --> 22:16.944
that admits that the
administration sent that list

22:16.987 --> 22:18.989
directly to the Taliban.

22:21.427 --> 22:24.299
- Why?
Why would they do that?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.693
- When we put the Taliban
in charge of security

22:26.736 --> 22:28.564
at the airport,
someone inadvertently

22:28.608 --> 22:31.393
shared the list of Afghans
who are still at risk.

22:31.437 --> 22:34.570
We essentially gave them
a hit list to go door to door

22:34.614 --> 22:37.878
killing our allies, and
that is exactly what they did.

22:37.921 --> 22:41.360
By the time I saw the list,
it had already been used.

22:41.403 --> 22:44.754
I didn't put lives at risk.
The administration did.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.539
I just wanted proof
that someone

22:46.582 --> 22:48.018
should be held accountable.

22:48.062 --> 22:49.933
But they locked me up before
I could talk to the press.

22:49.977 --> 22:52.719
- So you took the report
to release it to the public,

22:52.762 --> 22:54.416
even though you knew
it was classified?

22:54.460 --> 22:55.939
- My government asked me

22:55.983 --> 22:58.725
to rubber stamp fatal
incompetence and bury it, okay?

22:58.768 --> 23:02.903
But I refused, and now the AG
is trying to bury me instead.

23:02.946 --> 23:04.992
- We understand
that you feel threatened.

23:05.035 --> 23:06.907
But a member of
Attorney General Blair's team

23:06.950 --> 23:08.430
was killed last night.

23:08.474 --> 23:09.692
- And I already told you.

23:09.736 --> 23:10.911
I don't know
anything about that.

23:10.954 --> 23:13.392
I'm in a black hole here!

23:14.828 --> 23:17.439
Blair wants me silenced
by any means necessary.

23:17.483 --> 23:20.660
For all we know, she had that
poor guy thrown in the river.

23:20.703 --> 23:22.879
The rule of law
only protects the powerful.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.620
She can do whatever she wants

23:24.664 --> 23:27.144
and have people like you
make it all go away.

23:27.188 --> 23:30.626
[dramatic music]

23:30.670 --> 23:32.106
♪

23:34.021 --> 23:35.109
- Hey.

23:35.152 --> 23:37.590
Any sign of Sahar?
- Not yet.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.069
But we're gettin' her face
out there.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.463
There's no way she's gettin'
close to the primary now.

23:41.507 --> 23:42.943
- [sighs]

23:45.162 --> 23:46.686
Where's Scott?

23:48.688 --> 23:50.864
Keep me posted
if you get a hit.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.390
Hey.
- Hey.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.479
- Grimes has got you
back here now?

23:57.523 --> 23:59.176
- No, I'm choosing my battles.

23:59.220 --> 24:02.136
We need his approval to
implement my new security plan.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.878
Harmon and Vo
are giving out some scenarios,

24:04.921 --> 24:06.575
see if they can
punch some holes,

24:06.619 --> 24:09.448
and then I can get back
out there with you guys.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.058
- That's great.

24:11.101 --> 24:13.495
- How's it going
taking the lead?

24:13.539 --> 24:15.062
- Good.

24:16.846 --> 24:18.500
- Talk to me.

24:20.589 --> 24:21.590
- Okay.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.986
I'm about to go update Blair,

24:26.029 --> 24:28.684
and I just keep thinking about
her so-called whistleblower.

24:28.728 --> 24:31.861
He has an axe to grind,
obviously.

24:31.905 --> 24:34.037
But his facts all checked out.

24:34.081 --> 24:35.604
He was telling the truth
about the list,

24:35.648 --> 24:37.867
unlike the AG, who lied about
the reason she's here.

24:37.911 --> 24:40.522
- He walked out of that office
with classified intel.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.176
He's not exactly a hero, Jamie.

24:42.219 --> 24:45.440
- Agreed. But then,
why not charge him with that?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.616
Why paint him
as working with the Taliban

24:47.660 --> 24:49.705
so they could cover
their own asses?

24:49.749 --> 24:51.272
Blair came after him so hard,

24:51.315 --> 24:54.797
the Hungarians are treating him
like a political prisoner.

24:57.539 --> 25:00.194
Are we sure we're on
the right side of this?

25:01.761 --> 25:03.763
I don't want the FBI
to run interference

25:03.806 --> 25:05.678
for a corrupt official.

25:05.721 --> 25:07.680
- It is not our job
to take sides.

25:07.723 --> 25:10.465
We protect the AG because
that is part of the mission.

25:11.814 --> 25:14.817
No matter what you think
of her methods, Jamie,

25:14.861 --> 25:16.558
leave the politics at the door

25:16.602 --> 25:19.474
and focus on what John Mallory
actually gave us:

25:19.518 --> 25:21.520
a motive.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.173
Somehow the killer
knew about Mallory,

25:23.217 --> 25:24.653
and they wanted
this scandal to get out.

25:24.697 --> 25:27.177
Now, how did they know
about this secret,

25:27.221 --> 25:29.092
and what are they
planning on doing next?

25:29.136 --> 25:32.531
Look, if you want,
I can go brief the AG.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.924
- No, no.
You gave me this assignment,

25:34.968 --> 25:36.709
and I'm going to
see it through.

25:36.752 --> 25:39.538
But between us,
I can't shake the feeling

25:39.581 --> 25:41.583
that a man got pulled out
of the Danube

25:41.627 --> 25:43.280
because it's easier
to bury a mistake

25:43.324 --> 25:45.544
than to own up to one.
- Jamie...

25:45.587 --> 25:47.154
be careful.

25:47.197 --> 25:51.158
I know you have your
principles, and I respect that.

25:51.201 --> 25:52.725
But do not make an enemy

25:52.768 --> 25:56.032
of the most powerful person
in law enforcement.

25:58.208 --> 26:00.515
- "RPG attack
on the motorcade...

26:00.559 --> 26:01.951
"lone shooter
during press conference

26:01.995 --> 26:03.779
with the prosecutor general..."

26:03.823 --> 26:05.564
I have both of those
on my list too.

26:07.043 --> 26:09.785
"Sticky bomb"?
- Oh, could be a stretch.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.570
But Sahar
did have military training

26:11.613 --> 26:13.789
and grew up in a combat zone.

26:13.833 --> 26:16.270
I'm not ruling out anything.

26:16.313 --> 26:18.968
Let's see what you got.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.579
"Bomb planted in hotel

26:20.622 --> 26:23.277
by someone posing
as domestic staff."

26:23.320 --> 26:24.757
That's sneaky.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.106
- Thank you.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.673
- What's "medication swap"?

26:27.716 --> 26:30.153
- Well, I noticed
that the AG's security plan

26:30.197 --> 26:31.502
listed her prescription meds

26:31.546 --> 26:34.201
right down to the size
and colors of the pills.

26:34.244 --> 26:37.857
So if Sahar had access to that,
she could swap them out...

26:37.900 --> 26:39.989
and AG poisons herself.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.644
Look, it's a stretch, but--
- No, no.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.864
I like it.
We're putting it on the list.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.129
You know, you are
considerably more devious

26:49.172 --> 26:51.827
than I gave you credit for,
Agent Vo.

26:51.871 --> 26:53.176
I like this side of you.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.575
- You wanted to speak with me,
Agent Kellett?

27:00.619 --> 27:02.185
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry for interrupting.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.318
- We're on a smoke break
for the prosecutor general.

27:04.361 --> 27:06.320
What have you got?
- We have reason to believe

27:06.363 --> 27:07.800
that the suspect
we're looking for

27:07.843 --> 27:10.846
is connected to the
negotiations you're conducting.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.283
- Yes, I heard you had
a meeting with Mr. Mallory.

27:13.327 --> 27:15.808
- Yes, ma'am. I know these
are sensitive matters,

27:15.851 --> 27:17.592
but I just want to get
to the bottom of this

27:17.636 --> 27:18.680
as quickly as possible.

27:18.724 --> 27:20.290
- Are you implying
that I don't?

27:20.334 --> 27:22.597
- Of course not.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.731
It's unclear whether Mallory
directed the suspect

27:25.774 --> 27:27.602
to kill Mr. Gregory
or if the killer

27:27.646 --> 27:30.039
was merely someone
sympathetic to his situation.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.607
But just the fact she knows
about it could be a key

27:32.651 --> 27:34.696
in our investigation.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.698
Moving forward,
I'd like to be fully looped in

27:36.742 --> 27:39.179
on who you've met with
and what's been discussed.

27:41.398 --> 27:42.617
- I see.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.316
Well, that sounds reasonable.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.231
I'll have Amy
start to draw together a list.

27:48.275 --> 27:50.712
- Thank you, and if there's
anything else you can tell us,

27:50.756 --> 27:53.323
any possible connection between
Mia Sahar and John Mallory--

27:53.367 --> 27:55.064
- Mia Sahar?

27:55.108 --> 27:56.892
I-I'm sorry.
That's your suspect's name?

27:56.936 --> 27:58.633
- That's right.
You know it?

27:58.677 --> 28:01.114
- Months ago,
we got a bunch of letters

28:01.157 --> 28:03.072
from a woman named Mia Sahar.

28:03.116 --> 28:04.944
They started out
asking for our help,

28:04.987 --> 28:06.946
but then they got threatening.

28:08.164 --> 28:10.297
I-I'm so sorry.
Ken and I just turned it over

28:10.340 --> 28:11.646
to the unit director--
- That's fine.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.213
That's fine.
Threatening, how?

28:13.256 --> 28:16.738
- I remember she was upset
because her fiancé was killed.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.261
He was an Afghan National,

28:18.305 --> 28:20.176
a translator who was
helping the U.S. troops

28:20.220 --> 28:22.265
but was killed
before he could be evacuated.

28:22.309 --> 28:23.310
- Translator?

28:26.008 --> 28:28.924
- I think so.
What does that mean?

28:28.968 --> 28:31.927
Mia Sahar's fiancé
was on the kill list

28:31.971 --> 28:34.800
you've been trying to bury.

28:34.843 --> 28:37.803
She wants revenge.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.114
- Mia Sahar has
the motive and capability

28:45.158 --> 28:46.594
to carry out another attack.

28:46.637 --> 28:49.858
We now know she entered
the EU via Paris a week ago,

28:49.902 --> 28:51.599
just after
the AG's arrival there.

28:51.642 --> 28:52.774
So it looks like she's been

28:52.818 --> 28:54.863
following the trip
for some time,

28:54.907 --> 28:56.169
looking for vulnerabilities.

28:56.212 --> 28:58.824
- And somehow,
two steps ahead of us.

41:25.613 --> 41:27.528
- Oh, I don't know
if I'd go that far.

41:29.399 --> 41:31.793
You know,
I owe you a great deal...

41:31.837 --> 41:34.666
for saving my life
and for keeping my secret.

41:37.016 --> 41:38.321
We may not see eye-to-eye,

41:38.365 --> 41:40.976
but I have tremendous respect
for what you do.

41:41.020 --> 41:44.806
If you ever
get yourself into trouble...

41:44.850 --> 41:48.767
from the looks of it,
there's a good chance of that--

41:50.551 --> 41:51.987
Give me a call.

41:52.031 --> 41:54.816
I'll be there
to protect you in return.
