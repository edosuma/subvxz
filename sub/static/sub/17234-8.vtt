WEBVTT

00:03.500 --> 00:04.467
<i>Previously on "Nashville"...</i>

00:04.535 --> 00:05.802
Whoa! Whoa! God, I'm so sorry.

00:05.870 --> 00:07.236
You should try that again sometime.

00:08.272 --> 00:09.572
Why aren't we hearing the heartbeat yet?

00:09.640 --> 00:12.809
I'm so sorry, Peggy. You've lost the baby.

00:12.877 --> 00:15.611
Your career's taking
off. That is a good thing.

00:15.679 --> 00:16.945
And you're doing it with
Rayna. That's good, too.

00:17.013 --> 00:19.114
I'm gonna be sending you out on the road.

00:19.183 --> 00:20.383
Now by you joining this
tour, you are gonna get

00:20.450 --> 00:22.385
a firsthand look at
what it takes to make it.

00:22.452 --> 00:24.920
We are a team. We're gonna
make this album multiplatinum.

00:24.988 --> 00:26.455
I'm not doing a comeback album.

00:26.523 --> 00:27.890
I know you're sleeping with my husband,

00:27.957 --> 00:29.225
but what I don't understand

00:29.293 --> 00:31.277
is why you're not sleeping with me.

00:32.228 --> 00:33.796
What the hell are you doing?

00:33.863 --> 00:35.630
Did you think I was gonna be angry?

00:35.699 --> 00:38.233
I don't know what Charlie told you, but...

00:38.301 --> 00:40.769
He told me that I should
get to know you better

00:40.837 --> 00:45.140
so that maybe all of us
together could have some fun.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.642
What, have... a threesome?

00:47.710 --> 00:50.278
Not necessarily.

00:50.346 --> 00:52.914
Sometimes he likes to watch.

00:54.817 --> 00:57.219
I think that you...

00:57.286 --> 01:01.055
Should go. I think you should go.

01:01.123 --> 01:02.824
I'm surprised.

01:02.891 --> 01:06.493
He said you were adventurous,
but I guess he was wrong.

01:06.561 --> 01:09.530
I've had a lot of
adventure in my life, okay?

01:09.598 --> 01:11.833
I just don't like to share.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.868
<i>Well, Charlie is my husband.</i>

01:13.936 --> 01:18.305
So if there's anyone
who's sharing, it's me.

01:23.245 --> 01:25.045
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:26.748 --> 01:28.148
This is...

01:28.216 --> 01:30.351
- This is crazy, huh?
- Kinda.

01:30.418 --> 01:31.985
What are you doing here?

01:32.053 --> 01:35.088
Oh, um, Edgehill Records put me on the bus.

01:35.156 --> 01:37.124
I got a gig writing with Luke.

01:37.191 --> 01:40.160
I guess they wanted me on
the road with him. So...

01:40.228 --> 01:42.662
- That's a really big deal.
- Yeah.

01:42.730 --> 01:44.464
It's not as big as opening
for the guy, though.

01:44.531 --> 01:46.299
Okay, everybody. Get comfy.

01:46.367 --> 01:49.069
We got an all-nighter
drive to Tampa ahead of us.

01:49.137 --> 01:50.404
And you should get some rest.

01:50.405 --> 01:51.671
Big day tomorrow.

01:51.739 --> 01:53.073
Radio station in the morning,

01:53.141 --> 01:55.308
rehearsal, meet-and-greet,
then the gig, got it?

01:55.376 --> 01:56.242
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool.

01:56.310 --> 01:58.444
Well, I suppose I...

01:58.512 --> 01:59.912
Better hole up in my bunk.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.314
Get used to each other, folks.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.082
We're on this bus for the next few weeks.

02:03.150 --> 02:06.252
- Well, uh, good night.
- 'Night.

02:09.622 --> 02:11.490
Nashville overwhelmingly approves

02:11.557 --> 02:13.558
of its new "first lady."
Well, how about that?

02:13.626 --> 02:15.294
Yeah, how about that.

02:15.361 --> 02:17.797
Oh, they just love their mayor.

02:17.864 --> 02:19.564
You have a doctor's appointment
coming up this week, right?

02:19.632 --> 02:21.834
What a good daddy. You remembered.

02:21.902 --> 02:23.368
Why do you ask?

02:23.436 --> 02:24.937
I'd like to come with you this time.

02:27.740 --> 02:29.474
Oh, honey, you don't need to do that.

02:29.542 --> 02:31.476
- It's just a quick checkup.
- I know,

02:31.544 --> 02:33.578
but it's time I met your doctor anyway.

02:33.646 --> 02:34.813
So what day is it?

02:34.880 --> 02:37.081
It's, uh, Thursday at 1:00.

02:37.149 --> 02:38.517
I could shift some things around.

02:38.584 --> 02:39.818
Not a problem.

02:39.885 --> 02:43.721
Besides... it's important
for the three of us.

02:48.093 --> 02:49.194
Honey...

02:53.432 --> 02:55.700
I'm so glad you think so.

02:57.837 --> 02:58.970
- I'll call you later.
- All right.

02:59.038 --> 03:00.338
Bye.

03:00.405 --> 03:01.772
Bye.

03:03.208 --> 03:06.043
Are you packing for a world tour?

03:06.110 --> 03:09.112
'Cause I thought you were
just going to support Scarlett.

03:09.180 --> 03:11.582
Well, I'm also going to spend the weekend

03:11.650 --> 03:13.484
- with Luke Wheeler.
- Hmm.

03:13.552 --> 03:15.319
It all just feels like
everything's happening so fast.

03:15.387 --> 03:17.620
I mean, all that business
with Deacon and Maddie

03:17.688 --> 03:20.590
- was just last night.
- Maddie's gonna be fine.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.959
I'm gonna be taking care of the girls,

03:22.026 --> 03:24.561
Scarlett's gonna be
knockin' it out of the park,

03:24.628 --> 03:28.732
and... you're gonna be knockin'
boots with Luke Wheeler...

03:28.799 --> 03:31.034
Sexiest man in country music.

03:31.102 --> 03:33.236
<i>And I have gotten no
details about this at all.</i>

03:33.303 --> 03:36.639
So... I'm just wondering,
is he better than Liam?

03:36.707 --> 03:39.208
- I can't compare 'em.
- No, but I think you could.

03:39.276 --> 03:40.510
- No...  I don't...
- No, I do.

03:40.578 --> 03:43.546
No, Liam was just so...

03:43.614 --> 03:47.149
- Easy and fun and simple
and, you know? - Mm-hmm.

03:47.217 --> 03:49.018
Mm-hmm.

03:49.086 --> 03:52.188
Luke feels like... Somebody that I could...

03:52.256 --> 03:54.290
- I don't know...
- Be serious with?

03:54.358 --> 03:56.225
- I-it's too early to know
anything, really. - Hmm.

03:56.293 --> 03:59.428
<i>Oh! Too early for this?</i>

03:59.496 --> 04:01.097
Very nice.

04:01.164 --> 04:02.999
- Put that back.
- It's all lingerie in here.

04:03.066 --> 04:05.667
- No it is not all lingerie.
- Yeah, it is.

04:05.735 --> 04:07.335
- Is my jet ready?
- Yeah, it's on the tarmac.

04:07.404 --> 04:08.771
But I don't understand the rush.

04:08.838 --> 04:10.005
And what about the Wentworths?

04:10.072 --> 04:11.689
We gotta meet with them in a half an hour

04:11.690 --> 04:13.742
- to talk about the music festival.
- Tell them that I had to leave town early.

04:13.743 --> 04:16.244
God. Well, I'm getting
that, but I'm asking you why?

04:16.312 --> 04:17.946
It's none of their damn
business, that's why.

04:18.014 --> 04:20.149
- Did you get a hold of Avery?
- Yeah, he's gonna be at the house

04:20.149 --> 04:21.016
whenever you're ready.

04:21.017 --> 04:22.217
Good. I need to spend time on my music

04:22.285 --> 04:24.752
and not on people with expensive hobbies.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.554
Sweetie, look, the Wentworths...

04:26.622 --> 04:28.823
They're kind of like royalty.

04:28.891 --> 04:30.158
These are not the kind of people

04:30.226 --> 04:32.294
- you want to say "no" to.
- In case you haven't noticed,

04:32.361 --> 04:34.629
there's no one I can't say "screw you" to.

04:38.434 --> 04:40.401
Deacon? What... what are you doing here?

04:40.469 --> 04:41.469
What am I doing here?

04:41.537 --> 04:43.137
I'm here to see my little niece

04:43.204 --> 04:44.639
play in a stadium, that's what I'm doin'.

04:44.706 --> 04:47.542
- And to bring you this.
- Oh! Oh.

04:47.609 --> 04:49.410
Yeah, I know you can't sleep without it.

04:49.478 --> 04:51.111
Yeah, my bed is hard as a rock.

04:51.179 --> 04:54.348
Oh, well, that's life
on a tour bus, isn't it?

04:54.416 --> 04:56.283
It's nice to see a friendly face.

04:56.351 --> 04:57.985
You okay?

04:58.053 --> 05:01.155
Scarlett? Hey, I-I gotta
get you in rehearsal.

05:01.222 --> 05:04.091
Oh. This is my Uncle
Deacon, uh, Claybourne.

05:04.159 --> 05:05.559
- Hey, man!
- Hey.

05:05.626 --> 05:07.161
- Shep... tour manager.
- Hey, Shep, how are you doin'?

05:07.228 --> 05:08.628
Make sure you get a front
row seat, okay, buddy?

05:08.696 --> 05:09.964
I appreciate it.

05:10.031 --> 05:13.467
Gotta get a move on. All right.

05:13.534 --> 05:16.169
Oh. Thanks.

05:16.236 --> 05:18.505
Go get 'em.

05:18.573 --> 05:19.840
Tandy, will you just tell the driver

05:19.907 --> 05:21.475
I'll be out in two seconds?
I'm just gonna leave

05:21.542 --> 05:23.844
- a quick note for the girls.
-  Rayna?

05:23.911 --> 05:26.446
Yeah?

05:26.514 --> 05:28.014
These gentlemen need to see you.

05:28.082 --> 05:29.282
Oh.

05:29.350 --> 05:31.117
- You're not my driver.
- Excuse me.

05:31.185 --> 05:33.486
-Miss Jaymes?
- You know, if this is about our father,

05:33.553 --> 05:34.954
we have a family attorney

05:35.022 --> 05:36.422
who usually deals with these matters.

05:36.490 --> 05:38.724
This doesn't have
anything to do with daddy.

05:38.792 --> 05:40.393
Court order.

05:40.461 --> 05:44.530
You're in illegal possession
of Edgehill Records' property.

05:44.598 --> 05:46.164
What?

05:46.232 --> 05:47.867
You need to surrender
the masters of your album

05:47.934 --> 05:49.368
or face prosecution.

06:02.854 --> 06:04.720
I don't care if I have to go
to the state supreme court,

06:04.721 --> 06:07.622
- I'm not surrendering those masters.
- Sweetheart, your lawyers

06:07.690 --> 06:08.756
are gonna fight this thing, but right now

06:08.825 --> 06:10.025
I don't think you have a choice.

06:10.092 --> 06:11.159
Jeff is on a plane... The bastard.

06:11.227 --> 06:12.760
I spent all week going back and forth

06:12.829 --> 06:15.030
- with his lawyers over this.
- So he issues a court order,

06:15.097 --> 06:17.332
and then just takes off
for some island somewhere.

06:17.399 --> 06:19.901
Actually, no. He's... He's going to Tampa.

06:19.969 --> 06:21.303
He's going to the Luke Wheeler concerts.

06:21.370 --> 06:22.537
Of course he is.

06:22.604 --> 06:24.238
Excuse me, folks.

06:24.306 --> 06:25.906
I'm not in a position to wait much longer.

06:25.974 --> 06:28.509
What happens if I just don't comply?

06:28.577 --> 06:29.944
You'll be in contempt of court

06:30.011 --> 06:31.713
for unlawful possession
of Edgehill's property.

06:31.780 --> 06:32.847
He could arrest you right now.

06:32.914 --> 06:35.282
This is ridiculous!

06:41.990 --> 06:43.090
We're gonna get our team to file

06:43.158 --> 06:44.992
every injunction they can to reverse this.

06:45.060 --> 06:46.693
I promise you that, Ray.

06:58.038 --> 07:00.474
not to get too attached to it.

07:00.541 --> 07:02.509
Thank you.

07:02.577 --> 07:03.877
Y'all have a good day.

07:03.944 --> 07:05.912
You, too.

07:05.980 --> 07:07.914
This way, gentlemen.

07:07.982 --> 07:10.450
Will you please book me
another flight to Tampa

07:10.518 --> 07:12.818
since all this idiocy made me miss mine?

07:12.887 --> 07:16.589
What are you gonna do?

07:16.656 --> 07:19.359
I don't know.

07:19.426 --> 07:21.127
I'm gonna get my record back.

get back to somebody...

'Cause that... Is not normal behavior.

08:24.823 --> 08:27.791
I just don't want people
to keep interrupting.

08:27.859 --> 08:31.295
Look, I'm not your hired
hand anymore. I mean, I'm...

08:31.363 --> 08:33.264
I'm your friend.

08:33.332 --> 08:35.466
And I'm thinking maybe you came home

08:35.533 --> 08:36.667
because you needed one?

08:39.703 --> 08:41.905
Hey!

08:41.972 --> 08:43.273
Hey.

08:43.341 --> 08:45.208
- Oh.
- Sounded good down here.

08:45.276 --> 08:46.577
Really? Oh, yeah.

08:46.644 --> 08:48.479
Well, I can really only hear drums
and bass through these things.

08:48.546 --> 08:50.547
Then you need to talk to
your monitor guy about that.

08:50.615 --> 08:51.848
I tried. He said there wasn't time.

08:51.915 --> 08:53.616
- He had to open the doors.
- Oh.

08:53.684 --> 08:55.285
The stadium's just really big and boomy.

08:55.353 --> 08:56.552
Oh, yeah, but it's gonna warm up

08:56.620 --> 08:57.820
when they get all them bodies in there.

08:57.888 --> 09:00.857
41,807 of 'em.

09:00.924 --> 09:02.025
That's a lot of bodies.

09:02.093 --> 09:04.160
And they're all gonna love you.

09:04.228 --> 09:06.529
None of 'em more than me.

09:06.597 --> 09:07.597
I'm proud of you.

09:14.037 --> 09:15.304
I could drop down to
"a," if you don't like it.

09:15.372 --> 09:17.139
No, no. Hey, Gunnar,
to be honest with you...

09:17.207 --> 09:20.476
I'm not feelin' that one in any key.

09:20.544 --> 09:22.411
All right. Well, I-I got
a bunch of other ideas.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.980
That first one you played, though, uh,

09:25.048 --> 09:27.749
could be a song there, if
you put a little more...

09:27.817 --> 09:30.585
You know, "Wheeler" into it.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.654
Meaning what exactly?

09:32.722 --> 09:35.057
Well, you know, make it, uh...

09:35.125 --> 09:36.591
Make it fit me...

09:36.659 --> 09:39.461
Fit my brand. You know, um...

09:39.529 --> 09:42.964
30 million records sold, 22 number ones.

09:43.032 --> 09:45.503
That's why you're here, son,
to help me write that 23rd.

09:45.504 --> 09:46.621
Yep.

09:46.622 --> 09:48.169
Excuse me, Mr. Wheeler,
Rayna Jaymes is here.

09:48.237 --> 09:49.771
Oh, fantastic.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.506
Come back with a great hook for us, okay?

09:51.574 --> 09:53.174
All right.

09:53.242 --> 09:54.475
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh.

09:54.544 --> 09:55.977
Hey! Hey!

09:56.045 --> 09:57.412
Who's that?

09:57.479 --> 09:58.879
A new songwriter... Gunnar Scott.

09:58.947 --> 10:00.948
Oh, Scarlett used to talk about him.

10:01.016 --> 10:02.517
I wonder...

10:02.584 --> 10:04.085
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:04.153 --> 10:05.786
That's a nice hello.

10:05.854 --> 10:07.155
Well, what can I say?

10:07.222 --> 10:09.290
I know it's only been a day, but...

10:09.358 --> 10:10.358
I missed you.

10:10.426 --> 10:11.625
- Oh.
- Mm.

10:11.693 --> 10:14.161
Mm. Well, I almost didn't make it.

10:14.228 --> 10:16.597
Jeff Fordham decided to issue
a court order this morning

10:16.665 --> 10:19.600
and seized my masters.

10:19.668 --> 10:20.901
Well, I'm guessing

10:20.969 --> 10:23.003
I shouldn't have invited him to the show.

10:23.071 --> 10:25.072
You've got your business
relationship with him.

10:25.139 --> 10:27.908
<i>- Mine is strained at best.
- Hmm.</i>

10:27.976 --> 10:29.610
Well...

10:29.678 --> 10:31.711
- As my daddy used
to say... - Mm-hmm.

10:31.779 --> 10:35.515
"Attract more flies... With honey."

10:35.583 --> 10:36.916
Uh-huh.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.785
Are you sayin' I'm supposed
to be nice to that man?

10:38.852 --> 10:41.254
I don't know. He also used to
say, "fight fire with fire."

10:41.322 --> 10:42.989
- You're being so helpful.
- I know.

10:43.057 --> 10:44.491
Scarlett!

10:44.559 --> 10:47.326
Hey. I'm just coming by to
wish you good luck tonight.

10:47.394 --> 10:49.929
Thank you. I-I didn't
realize you would be here.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.764
Oh, no, I come out to all the big shows.

10:51.832 --> 10:53.365
Doesn't get much bigger than a...

10:53.433 --> 10:54.901
Luke Wheeler concert, now does it?

10:54.969 --> 10:57.103
No, it's the biggest
crowd I've ever played for.

10:57.170 --> 11:00.139
Mm-hmm. Well, a stadium
crowd can be tough.

11:00.207 --> 11:02.609
You only get one chance to
make a good first impression.

11:02.676 --> 11:04.676
Well, uh, since Rayna signed me,

11:04.744 --> 11:06.678
it's her impression I care most about.

11:06.746 --> 11:10.116
Well, considering that Rayna
failed to buy out Highway 65

11:10.183 --> 11:13.085
and your contract...
Technically, you answer to me.

11:13.153 --> 11:15.687
Personally, I feel that artists

11:15.755 --> 11:16.855
deserve to know where they stand.

11:18.325 --> 11:19.691
But we can talk about all this stuff later.

11:19.759 --> 11:21.493
Now get out there and you
have some fun, all right?

11:21.560 --> 11:24.062
- Jeff Fordham.
- Rayna Jaymes.

11:24.130 --> 11:26.297
What a treat. Did you come
out to see Scarlett's show?

11:26.365 --> 11:29.134
- I came out early just to catch it.
- Well, she's gonna kill it.

11:29.201 --> 11:31.003
- You ready to head
on out? - Mm-hmm.

11:31.070 --> 11:33.171
All right. We will see you later.

11:36.408 --> 11:37.742
Surprised to see you here.

11:37.809 --> 11:39.410
Thought you'd be tied up at home.

11:39.478 --> 11:41.412
Bet you did.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.648
Who's psyched to see

11:43.715 --> 11:45.082
Luke Wheeler tonight?!

11:45.151 --> 11:48.653
All right, let's go show the
world how amazing you are.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.088
Now before I bring out the wheel...

11:51.157 --> 11:52.107
I got a very special
opening act for you guys.

11:52.108 --> 11:53.057
Oh, honey, you are shaking like a leaf!

11:53.125 --> 11:54.709
You okay?

11:54.710 --> 11:56.293
Yeah, I'm just nervous,
is all. Um, I'm okay.

11:56.361 --> 11:57.011
All right, well, I'd be
surprised if you weren't.

11:57.012 --> 11:57.662
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:57.729 --> 11:59.296
- just...
- Put your hands together...

11:59.364 --> 12:01.398
- Take a deep breath.
- For Highway 65 recording artist...

12:01.466 --> 12:05.836
Miss Scarlett o'Connor!

12:05.904 --> 12:07.705
Whoo! Make me proud!

12:09.740 --> 12:11.275
Hey, Tampa!

12:11.342 --> 12:13.610
I'm Scarlett.

12:21.052 --> 12:22.919
I wish you hadn't brought in the lawyers.

12:22.987 --> 12:25.389
You should have just kept that between us.

12:25.456 --> 12:27.490
Oh, we're past that point.

12:27.558 --> 12:29.325
You guaranteed me a buyout...

12:29.393 --> 12:31.527

12:42.039 --> 12:43.972
Okay, I can't hear any
vocals in my monitors.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.454
And I love y'all so much,

13:44.521 --> 13:46.456
but I don't like booin' too much.

13:46.523 --> 13:47.924
I think that's kinda rude.

13:47.992 --> 13:49.525
I've always thought of you as family.

13:49.593 --> 13:51.828
I always will. So you
gotta trust me on something.

13:51.895 --> 13:53.663
This young girl you have

artists I have seen come out

13:56.467 --> 13:57.567
in a very long time.

13:57.634 --> 13:59.101
And it's not just me who believes so.

13:59.169 --> 14:01.303
Luke Wheeler thinks so, too.

14:01.371 --> 14:02.839
Whoo!

14:02.906 --> 14:04.540
Let's put our hands together

14:04.608 --> 14:07.877
and give her a nice, warm
welcome. Miss Scarlett o'Connor,

14:07.945 --> 14:11.180
and she is gonna play for you, Tampa.

14:19.889 --> 14:22.358
You can do this. You can.

All right, you go get 'em.

14:56.291 --> 14:59.426

14:59.494 --> 15:01.261
And then he started pursuing me

15:01.329 --> 15:03.130
and confiding in me and...

15:03.197 --> 15:05.232
Being there for me.

15:07.468 --> 15:10.037
And actually got me to believe

15:10.104 --> 15:13.674
that he might have cared.

15:13.742 --> 15:16.209
And then he sends his wife
over to proposition me.

15:16.277 --> 15:18.311
What?

15:18.379 --> 15:19.612
Oh, yeah.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.713
Apparently they're into threesomes,

15:20.781 --> 15:22.815
and I was the flavor of the month.

15:22.883 --> 15:25.452
Yeah, I had a similar experience

15:25.520 --> 15:27.587
being someone's toy. You did?

15:27.655 --> 15:30.157
Yeah. Well, I mean, not a threesome,

15:30.224 --> 15:35.161
but...  I had what you might call a...

15:35.228 --> 15:37.897
Sugar mama, I guess.

15:37.965 --> 15:41.200
A manager seduced me with the whole idea

15:41.268 --> 15:43.937
of fame and fortune.

15:44.004 --> 15:47.440
You can see how that panned out.

15:47.507 --> 15:50.976
And she conned me into thinking

15:51.044 --> 15:52.911
how special I was to her,

15:52.979 --> 15:57.383
but I was definitely just one of many.

15:57.451 --> 16:01.353
Nah, the difference is she
signed you for a reason.

16:01.421 --> 16:04.189
She saw you as a big star.

16:04.256 --> 16:07.492
I seriously doubt that
she saw you as a throwaway.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.427
Yeah, well...

16:11.731 --> 16:14.633
<i>Let me tell you somethin'...</i>

16:14.701 --> 16:17.803
You're no throwaway.

16:17.870 --> 16:19.871
And you don't have to keep letting

16:19.939 --> 16:22.507
the Wentworths of the world
treat you like garbage.

16:22.575 --> 16:25.710
You gotta stop giving
these people all your power.

16:28.314 --> 16:29.981
- Hey, h-hold up, Scarlett, Scarlett...
- No, Gunnar, please, not now.

16:30.048 --> 16:31.182
Look, I just... I just wanted to say,

16:31.250 --> 16:32.450
- I thought you did...
- Stop it! Leave me alone!

16:32.518 --> 16:35.453
- A great job.
- Gunnar, Luke's lookin' for you.

16:35.521 --> 16:37.822
Uh, yeah, I'll just be a-a second.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.458
Hey...

16:46.999 --> 16:48.766
I thought you might want this.

16:50.769 --> 16:52.670
They hated me.

16:52.738 --> 16:54.505
Baby, they don't even know you, all right,

16:54.572 --> 16:56.973
- 'cause they never even gave you a chance.
- They threw things at me.

16:57.041 --> 16:58.408
- Listen to me...
- If Rayna hadn't have gone out there...

16:58.476 --> 16:59.743
This is a Luke Wheeler audience.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.145
If you're not singing about beer or trucks,

17:01.212 --> 17:02.879
then they don't want to hear about it.

17:02.947 --> 17:05.015
All right? It's not you. It's them.

17:06.518 --> 17:07.983
But I let her down.

17:08.051 --> 17:09.935
- You did not let her down, but...
- I let you down.

17:09.935 --> 17:11.436
You flew... all the way
out here just to see that.

17:11.438 --> 17:12.320
No, you... you didn't let
anybody down, all right.

17:12.388 --> 17:13.790
I'm here for you and that's
what I'm doing right now.

17:13.858 --> 17:17.665
Rayna is right. You are a great
singer. You're a great performer.

17:17.665 --> 17:19.061
I know what you're trying
to do. Please, stop.

17:19.130 --> 17:21.865
Just... I know you're trying to help me.

17:21.932 --> 17:24.067
I love you so much,
but if you could just...

17:24.135 --> 17:26.202
Leave me alone a minute.

17:26.270 --> 17:28.804
Please. Please.

17:28.872 --> 17:31.641
All right.

17:53.096 --> 17:54.563

they gonna sing something else...

17:58.301 --> 18:00.702
A song called, "boo! Get off the stage."

18:00.769 --> 18:02.504
Well, Scarlett didn't deserve that.

18:02.572 --> 18:04.772
Man, she's talented. So...

18:04.840 --> 18:06.274
So was her Uncle Deacon.

18:09.245 --> 18:11.413
Not everybody makes it, son...

18:11.480 --> 18:13.615
As hit performers or songwriters.

18:13.683 --> 18:16.184
Let's go!

18:22.091 --> 18:24.826
Go away!

18:24.893 --> 18:26.828
Oh, please, could you...

18:26.895 --> 18:28.262
Oh.

18:28.330 --> 18:29.296
Hey, girl.

18:29.364 --> 18:30.598
I'm sorry.

18:30.665 --> 18:34.000
You don't have to apologize to me.

18:34.068 --> 18:36.503
I messed up so bad out there.

18:36.571 --> 18:38.171
Oh, honey, shoot.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.073
The only time that you'll ever mess up

18:40.141 --> 18:42.376
is if you don't get up, dust yourself off,

18:42.444 --> 18:44.177
and go right back on.

18:46.248 --> 18:49.549
You only get one chance
to impress a stadium crowd.

18:50.752 --> 18:52.853
Who told you that line of crap?

18:52.920 --> 18:55.488
Shoot, if that was true, I
wouldn't have a career, man.

18:55.556 --> 18:57.924
I got booed so many times,

18:57.992 --> 19:00.961
I had people yell, "show
me your boobs" so much,

19:01.028 --> 19:03.797
you would have thought
it was a hit damn song.

19:03.865 --> 19:06.699
But here's the deal...
You gotta be tougher.

19:06.767 --> 19:08.334
Listen, I wasn't kidding when I said

19:08.402 --> 19:10.403
you're a great artist.

19:10.471 --> 19:11.638
You are.

19:11.705 --> 19:13.839
But with that comes a responsibility.

19:13.907 --> 19:15.742
You got a voice you gotta put out there.

19:15.809 --> 19:18.411
You have a gift that
you gotta give, you know?

19:18.479 --> 19:19.945
You can't let anybody
stop you from doing that.

19:20.013 --> 19:24.850
Did you try to buy out 65 from Edgehill?

19:24.918 --> 19:28.387
I'm... yeah, I'm trying.

19:30.757 --> 19:32.224
But that shouldn't be any concern of yours.

19:32.292 --> 19:34.894
Jeff Fordham told me that it means

19:34.961 --> 19:37.263
I don't answer to you
anymore. I answer to him.

19:37.330 --> 19:38.397
No, that's not true.

19:38.464 --> 19:39.698
What I'm trying to do

19:39.766 --> 19:41.032
is get us out from under his thumb.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.401
You and I are partners.

19:42.468 --> 19:44.636
- I don't like that man.
- I don't like him either.

19:44.704 --> 19:47.506
He's a bully.

19:47.573 --> 19:48.707
And the thing about bullies

19:48.775 --> 19:51.176
is they secretly want to be stopped.

19:51.243 --> 19:53.312
So we can't let him stop us.

20:02.121 --> 20:04.055
Wheels up, Tampa, Florida!

20:06.826 --> 20:08.492
Y'all better buckle in,

20:08.560 --> 20:10.628
'cause we're about to tear
this sucker down to studs!

20:10.696 --> 20:11.729
Here we go!

20:13.732 --> 20:15.733
Hey, Jeff. You got a minute?

20:15.801 --> 20:17.401
Yeah, yeah, I was just
off to enjoy Luke's show...

20:17.469 --> 20:18.769
It's bound to go smoother than Scarlett's.

20:18.837 --> 20:20.471
Yeah, don't you ever tell my artist

20:20.539 --> 20:21.972
that she answers to you.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.374
Hey, I only told her the truth.

20:23.442 --> 20:25.042
She's under our contract, and so are you,

20:25.109 --> 20:27.044
though you've been in breach since day one.

20:27.111 --> 20:29.313
You poached one of my artists,
you sabotage another one,

20:29.380 --> 20:31.414
you seize my masters.
What is your endgame here?

20:31.482 --> 20:33.183
- Profit.
- Of course.

20:33.251 --> 20:34.584
Every day that I don't
release a Rayna Jaymes record,

20:34.652 --> 20:36.519
I lose more and more of it.

20:36.587 --> 20:37.988
You don't have a Rayna Jaymes record.

20:38.056 --> 20:39.389
The record is not ready, and
it is not yours to release.

20:39.457 --> 20:40.557
Well, I'm not willing to wait

20:40.624 --> 20:42.226
while you tinker with it to perfection.

20:42.293 --> 20:44.161
We have a window of time
to capitalize on your heat

20:44.229 --> 20:46.429
<i>since your accident, and that time is now.</i>

20:46.497 --> 20:48.631
With my marketing campaign,

20:48.699 --> 20:51.000
- I'm confident we will sell millions, okay?
- What are you even talking about?!

20:51.068 --> 20:52.469
I'm gonna show you some of the key art.

20:52.536 --> 20:54.303
I came up with the concept myself.

20:56.039 --> 20:58.307
You love it, right?

21:07.763 --> 21:08.863
Over my dead body am I gonna let them

21:08.931 --> 21:10.832
put out an album with a marketing campaign

21:10.900 --> 21:12.734
<i>- that is based around my dead body.
-  Yeah, well,</i>

21:12.802 --> 21:13.701
we're fighting it tooth and nail, ray.

21:13.769 --> 21:15.202
But from what I understand,

21:15.270 --> 21:17.839
Jeff is under a lot of pressure
to deliver a big quarter.

21:17.907 --> 21:18.840
You know what? He just wants to look good

21:18.908 --> 21:20.107
in front of his corporation.

21:20.175 --> 21:21.475
I swear, I should have
just let them arrest me.

21:21.543 --> 21:24.378
Okay, well, as your
manager, I beg to differ.

21:24.446 --> 21:26.480
Let me call you right back, okay, Buck?

21:26.548 --> 21:27.648
Thanks.

21:27.715 --> 21:29.250
Hey.

21:29.318 --> 21:30.851
Sounds, uh, serious there.

21:30.919 --> 21:34.188
Label nightmare.

21:34.256 --> 21:36.089
Oh, yeah, that new guy?

21:36.157 --> 21:37.791
- Yeah, I wanted to...
- Listen, I wanted to ta...

21:37.859 --> 21:39.159
- Oh, go ahead.
-  No, you go.

21:41.429 --> 21:44.230
I just wanted to say that
you were great last night.

21:44.298 --> 21:46.333
And it was really special to be there

21:46.400 --> 21:48.535
- with you and Maddie.
- It was great having her there.

21:48.603 --> 21:50.871
<i>It was great... Having you there.</i>

21:50.939 --> 21:52.572
I mean, I'm glad you called. Thank you.

21:52.639 --> 21:54.474
Yeah.

21:54.541 --> 21:56.809
Look, I just...

21:56.877 --> 21:58.478
I wanted to talk about Scarlett, all right?

21:58.545 --> 22:01.081
I just... I don't think
she's ready for all this.

22:01.148 --> 22:02.915
I appreciate all you've done for her,

22:02.984 --> 22:04.117
and you saved her up there.

22:04.185 --> 22:05.452
But this is just gonna keep happening.

22:05.519 --> 22:07.153
These Wheeler fans...
They're gonna eat her alive

22:07.221 --> 22:09.388
every single night, and...

22:09.456 --> 22:11.290
I just don't think she
should be on the tour.

22:11.358 --> 22:12.592
I couldn't disagree with you more.

22:12.659 --> 22:14.827
You know, she's... Listen,
she had one misstep,

22:14.895 --> 22:16.696
- but after I pulled her off...
- She froze, Ray.

22:16.763 --> 22:19.365
- She froze dead up there.
- Well, she... it's her first stadium show.

22:19.432 --> 22:20.867
- Her monitors were screwed up.
- I know.

22:20.934 --> 22:22.434
You know, she got a
little bit of stage fright,

22:22.503 --> 22:23.703
- but she's gonna get over all that.
- Look, I don't know.

22:23.770 --> 22:25.237
I just think being treated like that,

22:25.305 --> 22:26.938
it can be damaging to a person,

22:27.007 --> 22:28.207
let alone a young artist.

22:28.274 --> 22:29.875
Remember what Watty used to say?

22:29.942 --> 22:33.112
He used to always say,
"steel is forged in the fire."

22:33.179 --> 22:34.846
She wants this.

22:34.914 --> 22:36.748
She's gonna toughen up.

22:36.816 --> 22:40.552
Not everybody's as tough as you are.

22:45.992 --> 22:48.026
Charlie, Olivia.

22:48.093 --> 22:50.294
Juliette... What are you doing here?

22:50.362 --> 22:52.096
Oh, I have a private jet, too.

22:52.164 --> 22:53.532
So I just stopped by

22:53.599 --> 22:56.968
to respond to your lovely
wife's invitation personally.

22:57.036 --> 22:58.202
What are you talking about?

22:58.270 --> 23:00.338
You really need to be more selective,

23:00.406 --> 23:03.207
Charlie, and consider the mental health

23:03.275 --> 23:05.076
of your mistresses.

23:05.144 --> 23:08.146
And, you know, I used to
think that blue bloods like you

23:08.213 --> 23:10.915
were better than me. But you know what?

23:10.982 --> 23:14.685
You're all just a bunch of
sick, narcissistic perverts.

23:14.753 --> 23:17.054
Says the mobile home queen.

23:17.121 --> 23:19.623
You know what?

23:19.691 --> 23:22.993
I'd rather spend the rest
of my life in a double-wide

23:23.061 --> 23:24.261
than spend another minute

23:24.328 --> 23:26.597
around a billionaire bitch like you.

23:26.665 --> 23:28.699
But I guess my trailer park education

23:28.767 --> 23:29.967
did let me down a little bit.

23:30.035 --> 23:32.536
'Cause I wasn't smart enough to realize

23:32.603 --> 23:36.573
- just how empty you really are.
- Juliette, wait.

23:38.276 --> 23:39.642

Have to.

24:43.506 --> 24:44.805
It's a long tour,

24:44.873 --> 24:47.375

me or... show? Scarlett?

26:14.861 --> 26:19.297
Not with you. You're wonderful.

26:19.365 --> 26:20.865
No, I just... I can't believe...

26:20.933 --> 26:23.568
I can't believe I'm in
this battle with Jeff.

26:23.636 --> 26:25.670
Well, you want me to talk to him?

26:25.738 --> 26:28.340
I got a fair amount of sway
there these days, you know?

26:28.407 --> 26:29.841
That's very sweet of you.

26:29.908 --> 26:31.476

Well, doesn't seem to be working.

I've been nice to him. I've
stood up to him. I've...

26:41.519 --> 26:43.487
Well, hell, what's he want?

26:43.555 --> 26:45.489
Well...

26:45.557 --> 26:47.558
- Quarterly sales.
-Ah.

26:47.626 --> 26:49.660
He wants to release my
album is what he wants.

26:49.728 --> 26:52.363

I can't let him do it.

27:45.748 --> 27:48.450
I'm... I'm not doing so good.

27:48.518 --> 27:50.619
Really? What's going on?

27:50.687 --> 27:53.588
I don't know. I've been cramping.

27:53.656 --> 27:56.358
Huh. Well, did you call your doctor?

27:56.426 --> 27:57.626
Yeah, they closed early today,

27:57.694 --> 28:00.729
but I left a message with their service.

28:00.797 --> 28:02.263
Do you think you need to go to the E.R.?

28:02.332 --> 28:07.369
No, I... maybe it's just
food poisoning or something.

28:07.437 --> 28:09.237
Well, look, I-I can
cancel the rest of my day

28:09.305 --> 28:11.005
and I'll come home right away.

28:11.073 --> 28:14.876
You don't have to do that.
I... I'm sure it'll pass.

28:14.944 --> 28:16.978
Are you sure?

28:17.046 --> 28:19.080
Yeah, I'll be fine.

28:19.148 --> 28:21.382
Okay. All right, look, if things get worse

28:21.450 --> 28:22.650
you call me, all right?

28:22.718 --> 28:24.118
I will, thanks.

28:24.186 --> 28:25.820
All right, bye.

28:57.668 --> 28:58.735
- Amen.
- Whoo.

29:01.206 --> 29:03.107
Congrats on our first co-write, bud.

29:03.174 --> 29:04.508
Co-write?

29:04.576 --> 29:06.210
I'm just messing with you, man.

29:06.277 --> 29:08.745
Rayna's got a soft spot for young artists.

29:08.813 --> 29:11.548
You are getting sole
writing credit on this one.

29:11.616 --> 29:13.083
Seriously? Thank you.

29:13.151 --> 29:14.417
Thank her.

29:14.485 --> 29:16.620
She's the one who lit
a fire under this thing.

29:16.687 --> 29:17.988
Ms. Jaymes, thank you so much.

29:18.055 --> 29:19.455
Oh, listen. I'm so excited about it,

29:19.523 --> 29:20.657
I think we should play it

29:20.725 --> 29:21.992
in front of 40,000 people tonight.

29:22.059 --> 29:26.096
Really? You want... you
want me to play with you?

29:26.163 --> 29:28.131
No, son. We got it covered.

29:28.198 --> 29:29.132
Your job's done. Okay.

29:29.199 --> 29:31.066
Let's learn this thing, fellas.

29:31.135 --> 29:33.102
The looks on their faces.

29:33.170 --> 29:34.737
That alone was worth the flight.

29:34.804 --> 29:37.173
I can only imagine.

29:37.241 --> 29:40.909
But more than that, I feel like a weight

29:40.977 --> 29:42.645
has been lifted off of my shoulders.

29:42.712 --> 29:43.979
I mean, seriously.

29:44.047 --> 29:45.948
And I have your...

29:46.016 --> 29:48.751
Musical therapy session to thank for that.

29:48.818 --> 29:51.060
Well, I didn't think it'd
take you all the way to Dallas,

29:51.061 --> 29:53.455
- but, hey, whatever works.
- Whatever works!

29:53.523 --> 29:55.691
<i>Man, who would've thunk?</i>

29:55.759 --> 29:59.461
Bumping into you back
in the day at the Opry.

29:59.529 --> 30:01.997
You said you didn't remember that.

30:02.065 --> 30:03.231
It took me a while,

30:03.299 --> 30:05.233
but I think I finally put it together.

30:05.301 --> 30:08.069
- It was when Watty white was being honored.
- Yes!

30:08.137 --> 30:09.904

30:13.643 --> 30:16.411
Well, I guess it just came
bubbling to the surface

30:16.479 --> 30:17.912
when it was supposed to.

30:20.149 --> 30:21.849
It's Scarlett.

38:54.149 --> 38:57.085
if you release that as a digital single,

40:49.227 --> 40:50.260
Hmm.

40:56.668 --> 40:59.103
I like being naked with you.

41:03.841 --> 41:06.576

least that's what it said

said, but I'm not a liar.

42:23.652 --> 42:25.419

And I'm not interested
in being the empty person

42:26.988 --> 42:28.055
you accused me of being.

42:30.157 --> 42:33.359
The empty person I've become.

42:33.427 --> 42:35.028
Look, I'm not here to apologize

42:35.096 --> 42:36.196
or proposition or anything.

42:36.263 --> 42:39.165
I'm just here to tell you that...

42:41.936 --> 42:43.803
I think I'm falling in love with you.
