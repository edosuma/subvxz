(popping)

00:05.088 --> 00:07.007
(grunts warningly)

00:20.103 --> 00:21.981
(laughing)

00:22.021 --> 00:23.190
Look at that.

00:26.610 --> 00:27.903
Ch...

00:27.945 --> 00:28.904
Ch?

00:28.946 --> 00:30.489
Che...

00:30.531 --> 00:31.782
Check?

00:31.824 --> 00:33.074
Check.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.285
M...

00:35.327 --> 00:38.706
Maaa... ate?

00:38.747 --> 00:40.582
Checkmate?

00:40.624 --> 00:42.668
Checkmate! So it is.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.795
See, it just goes

00:42.710 --> 00:44.795
to show you.

00:44.837 --> 00:48.089
Yes, well,

00:44.837 --> 00:48.089
good game, son.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.758
(chuckling gleefully)

00:49.800 --> 00:51.092
Lois!

00:51.134 --> 00:54.013
Hey, he lets me win

00:51.134 --> 00:54.013

01:27.086 --> 01:29.130
All right, spin around twice,

01:27.086 --> 01:29.130
hit the ball

01:29.172 --> 01:30.131
on the second bounce.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.299
It's two points

01:30.173 --> 01:31.299
for a car

01:31.341 --> 01:32.718
and three for

01:31.341 --> 01:32.718
a fire hydrant.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.011
It's an out if

01:32.760 --> 01:34.011
they catch it

01:34.053 --> 01:35.763
and two if they hit

01:34.053 --> 01:35.763
you with the ball.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.305
Now, if they miss,

01:35.804 --> 01:37.305
it's a "google,"

01:37.347 --> 01:39.140
which I'll explain

01:37.347 --> 01:39.140
when we get there.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.517
You're up.

01:40.559 --> 01:41.602
It's amazing.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.978
Reese can't pass math,

01:43.020 --> 01:45.188
but he's invented

01:43.020 --> 01:45.188
over, like, 50 games.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.565
Fun games.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.274
Okay, spin!

01:50.110 --> 01:52.487
I got it. I got it.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.910
Not Mrs. Griffin's yard.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.455
There it is.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.415
Dude, she doesn't like

02:01.496 --> 02:03.415
anybody in her yard.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.167
I'll be in and out of there

02:03.457 --> 02:06.167
before she knows it, right?

02:06.209 --> 02:07.377
Just because

02:06.209 --> 02:07.377
she's old and mean

02:07.419 --> 02:09.755
doesn't give her the right

02:07.419 --> 02:09.755
to keep our balls.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.882
I'm sold. Go for it.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.467
Fine, I'll do it.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.761
It's no big deal.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.512
I don't see you moving.

02:28.941 --> 02:30.985
(screaming)

02:31.026 --> 02:32.111
What are you

02:31.026 --> 02:32.111
doing in my yard?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.904
Let go! It's my ball!

02:33.946 --> 02:35.405
My property, my ball!

02:35.447 --> 02:37.825
Who said you could

02:35.447 --> 02:37.825
come into my yard?

02:37.866 --> 02:39.076
Ow! What are you doing?!

02:39.118 --> 02:40.285
Choose, boy!

02:40.327 --> 02:42.203
Hair or ball?!

02:42.245 --> 02:43.246
(screams)

02:43.288 --> 02:44.205
(gasps)

02:44.247 --> 02:45.916
You broke her arm?

02:45.958 --> 02:47.126
I was getting a ball.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.586
You broke her arm for a ball?

02:49.628 --> 02:52.131
No, I already had the ball,

02:49.628 --> 02:52.131
then I pushed her away.

02:52.171 --> 02:55.216
You pushed her and broke

02:52.171 --> 02:55.216
her arm for a ball?

02:55.258 --> 02:57.302
Was it a special

02:55.258 --> 02:57.302
ball, son?

02:57.344 --> 02:59.054
It was just a flat

02:57.344 --> 02:59.054
old tennis ball.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.682
Sometimes I don't know why

02:59.096 --> 03:01.682
he does the things he does.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.224
LOIS: At least

03:01.723 --> 03:03.224
she's not suing us.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.685
You just be thankful we have

03:04.726 --> 03:06.311
absolutely nothing of value

03:04.726 --> 03:06.311
in this house.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.521
Count your

03:06.353 --> 03:07.521
blessings, son.

03:07.562 --> 03:08.605
I talked to Mrs. Griffin.

03:08.647 --> 03:09.898
This is what's going to happen.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.026
You are going to go there

03:09.940 --> 03:12.026
every day after school

03:12.067 --> 03:14.111
and help that poor old woman

03:12.067 --> 03:14.111
until her arm heals.

03:14.153 --> 03:15.154
Every day?

03:15.194 --> 03:16.905
Not one word!

03:15.194 --> 03:16.905
Every day.

03:16.947 --> 03:17.948
(telephone rings)

03:17.990 --> 03:18.949
End of story.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.534
Hello?

03:20.575 --> 03:22.161
Hey, Ma, listen,

03:22.201 --> 03:23.662
did you happen to talk

03:22.201 --> 03:23.662
to Richie's mom recently?

03:23.704 --> 03:25.246
Yeah, as a matter of fact I did.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.874
I ran into her at work

03:25.288 --> 03:26.874
the other day.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.333
Did you happen to talk

03:26.915 --> 03:28.333
about Richie at all?

03:28.375 --> 03:29.334
Oh, that poor woman.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.752
Do you know how much grief

03:30.794 --> 03:32.420
that boy is putting her through?

03:32.462 --> 03:34.339
I told her if she had

03:32.462 --> 03:34.339
a brain in her head,

03:34.381 --> 03:37.092
she'd pack him off to military

03:34.381 --> 03:37.092
school and straighten him out

03:37.134 --> 03:38.552
before he got

03:37.134 --> 03:38.552
into serious trouble.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.470
Okay, thanks.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.470
Got to go.

03:40.512 --> 03:44.099
Well, it wasn't her.

03:50.189 --> 03:52.858
(blades grinding backpack)

03:52.900 --> 03:54.735
I need a new backpack.

03:54.776 --> 03:58.279
Again? How do you keep

03:54.776 --> 03:58.279
ruining them?

03:54.776 --> 03:58.279
I don't know.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.157
Well, I'm not buying you

03:58.321 --> 04:00.157
another backpack.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.117
You just find something

04:00.199 --> 04:02.117
in the closet.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.243
Okay.

04:14.213 --> 04:17.132
Okay, maybe it's a good thing

04:14.213 --> 04:17.132
that I'm doing this.

04:17.174 --> 04:19.300
I'm not saying

04:17.174 --> 04:19.300
I'm completely to blame,

04:19.342 --> 04:21.178
but in a way I am responsible.

04:21.220 --> 04:24.264
I guess I  was  trespassing,

04:21.220 --> 04:24.264
and I did hip-check her.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.310
And who knows,

04:26.600 --> 04:29.310
maybe she won't be that bad.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.230
Maybe she'll be like a grandma--

04:31.271 --> 04:34.149
well, not like  my  grandma--

04:31.271 --> 04:34.149
like a nice grandma.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.734
Hi, I'm Malcolm.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.402
I'm the kid who

04:35.776 --> 04:37.402
broke your arm.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.486
I'm really sorry.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.571
Here, fill this up.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.282
I'm not having any druggies

04:39.613 --> 04:42.282
in my house.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.836
God, she's like

04:52.417 --> 04:54.836
a homeless person,

04:54.878 --> 04:57.338
and this house

04:54.878 --> 04:57.338
is her shopping cart.

04:57.380 --> 05:01.969
Get out of the way,

04:57.380 --> 05:01.969
you damn ugly beast.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.386
What'd you do, stupid?

05:03.428 --> 05:06.347
What?

05:03.428 --> 05:06.347
Does this look like

05:03.428 --> 05:06.347
a rubber band jar to you?

05:06.389 --> 05:08.183
This  is a rubber band jar.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.144
Are you ignorant

05:08.225 --> 05:10.144
or just stupid?

05:10.185 --> 05:11.853
Neither.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.853
There's no such thing...

05:11.895 --> 05:13.272
Did you finish

05:11.895 --> 05:13.272
moving my papers?

05:13.354 --> 05:14.355
Almost.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.649
Do you read all these?

05:15.690 --> 05:16.858
What, are you

05:15.690 --> 05:16.858
writing a book?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.110
Just move 'em.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.529
What are you?

05:21.571 --> 05:23.448
What, like how old?

05:23.490 --> 05:25.366
No, what are you?

05:25.408 --> 05:27.286
Polack? Swede?

05:27.327 --> 05:28.369
Apache?

05:28.411 --> 05:30.038
I really don't know.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.292
Uh-huh, a mutt.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.419
Well, whatever you are,

05:33.333 --> 05:36.419
stay away from my liquor.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.797
Look, it's almost 5:00,

05:36.461 --> 05:38.797
I'm going to get going soon.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.423
Really?

05:40.465 --> 05:43.969
I didn't realize my arm stopped

05:40.465 --> 05:43.969
being broken at 5:00.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.762
What am I going to do

05:44.011 --> 05:45.762
for dinner?

05:45.804 --> 05:47.388
Can't you just order take-out?

05:47.430 --> 05:49.599
I'm not giving those Mexicans

05:47.430 --> 05:49.599
my money.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.018
They're as bad

05:51.059 --> 05:53.770
as that Lithuanian

05:51.059 --> 05:53.770
that fixed my screens.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.605
Boy, did he love ice cubes.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.025
Those 'Wanians

05:55.647 --> 05:58.025
and their ice cubes.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.401
I can't believe

05:58.066 --> 06:00.401
how horrible she is.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.403
I'm just going to ignore her.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.240
But you just try

06:02.445 --> 06:05.240
and get those people

06:05.282 --> 06:06.449
to pay for anything.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.409
Oh, he got

06:06.491 --> 06:08.409
his special ice.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.662
I suppose

06:08.451 --> 06:10.662
you're Dutch.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.413
You got eyes like a Dutchman--

06:12.455 --> 06:13.414
real pinny.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.334
You got those

06:13.456 --> 06:15.334
pinny Dutch eyes.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.423
What's that?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.423
My new backpack.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.219
Dewey, that's not a backpack;

06:22.465 --> 06:25.219
that's Mom's purse.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.346
Now, go back and

06:25.260 --> 06:27.346
get something else.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.346
No.

06:27.386 --> 06:29.806
Dewey, you're wearing

06:27.386 --> 06:29.806
an invitation to an ass-kicking.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.475
I like it.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.475
Look... I don't think

06:29.848 --> 06:32.475
you understand.

06:32.517 --> 06:35.229
Kids like me are dreaming

06:32.517 --> 06:35.229
about something like this.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.480
We look around the playground

06:35.270 --> 06:37.480
and we see

06:37.522 --> 06:39.691
normal kid, normal kid,

06:37.522 --> 06:39.691
and a kid with a purse.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.735
Who do you think's

06:39.733 --> 06:41.735
going to get creamed?

06:41.776 --> 06:43.528
Is one of the

06:41.776 --> 06:43.528
normal kids fat?

06:43.570 --> 06:44.612
It doesn't matter!

06:44.654 --> 06:46.447
He's going to be fat

06:44.654 --> 06:46.447
every day.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.450
Now, the kid with the purse,

06:46.489 --> 06:49.450
he might not wear it again.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.827
I don't care.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.827
I like it.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.453
Give me that!

06:50.869 --> 06:52.453
No!

06:52.495 --> 06:54.122
You don't know what these

06:52.495 --> 06:54.122
animals are capable of!

06:54.164 --> 06:55.040
Let go!

06:55.082 --> 06:56.375
(grunting angrily)

06:56.415 --> 06:59.336
I'm trying to protect you!

07:01.963 --> 07:03.464
Richie, what are you doing?

07:03.506 --> 07:04.465
We have inspection.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.134
You can't sleep all morning.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.470
Dude... not cool.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.471
Richie,

07:10.513 --> 07:11.472
this isn't like home.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.974
You can't do whatever you want.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.059
These guys are hard-core.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.145
And also, there are some

07:14.101 --> 07:17.145
crappy flat pillows.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.397
Who do I talk

07:17.187 --> 07:18.397
to about that?

07:18.479 --> 07:19.439
MAN:

07:18.479 --> 07:19.439
Ten hut!

07:20.899 --> 07:22.317
(whispers):

07:20.899 --> 07:22.317
Stand up.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.489
Pajamas, Cadet?

07:28.531 --> 07:30.700
Sir, I'm sorry for my fellow

07:28.531 --> 07:30.700
cadet's appearance.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.202
He's fresh from civilian life

07:32.244 --> 07:33.912
and is taking a little

07:32.244 --> 07:33.912
time to adjust.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.248
Hey, are you the dude

07:33.954 --> 07:36.248
who hands out the guns?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.499
And you can see

07:38.541 --> 07:39.667
he's very anxious

07:38.541 --> 07:39.667
to assimilate himself

07:39.709 --> 07:41.544
into our military lifestyle.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.297
What's your name, Cadet?

07:43.338 --> 07:44.798
Richie. Pleasure.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.758
Listen closely,

07:44.839 --> 07:46.758
Cadet.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.595
This is not going

07:46.800 --> 07:50.595
to be easy for you.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.972
Your family sent you here

07:52.013 --> 07:54.349
because you couldn't

07:52.013 --> 07:54.349
handle it at home.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.558
Maybe you were coddled.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.769
Well, there is no coddling here.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.895
You make a mistake

07:58.937 --> 08:00.563
and you will be

07:58.937 --> 08:00.563
punished.

08:00.605 --> 08:04.525
Be aware, Cadet,

08:00.605 --> 08:04.525
I am keeping my eye on you.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.154
(laughs)

08:07.195 --> 08:08.447
Good one.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.530
Pardon?

08:09.572 --> 08:11.325
You're keeping

08:09.572 --> 08:11.325
your eye on me.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.410
You know, you got

08:11.366 --> 08:13.410
only one eye.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.536
(laughs):

08:13.452 --> 08:15.536
Like Popeye.

08:15.578 --> 08:18.248
I think it's cool that

08:15.578 --> 08:18.248
you're cool with it.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.835
(chuckles)

08:21.876 --> 08:23.544
That's amusing.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.465
I've never heard that before.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.175
Carry on.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.343
(chuckling)

08:29.384 --> 08:31.470
Popeye.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.180
Quite amusing.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.226
Is he like our butler

08:35.182 --> 08:38.226
or something?

08:40.603 --> 08:42.189
I can't close my eyes.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.232
Every time I do,

08:42.230 --> 08:44.232
I see what was under that robe

08:44.274 --> 08:45.566
on the inside of my eyelids.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.277
I can't go back there.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.570
Malcolm, why aren't you over

08:47.319 --> 08:49.570
at Mrs. Griffin's?

08:49.612 --> 08:50.571
She said she doesn't

08:49.612 --> 08:50.571
need me anymore.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.240
There's some new medicine.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.241
It's good for

08:52.282 --> 08:53.241
old people's bones.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.617
She has a lot of pride.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.577
I think it bothers her

08:54.659 --> 08:56.577
when I'm over there.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.747
I am so sorry.

08:59.789 --> 09:00.999
GRIFFIN:

08:59.789 --> 09:00.999
That's all right.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.625
I'm sure,

09:01.041 --> 09:02.625
when I was his age,

09:02.667 --> 09:04.794
I wouldn't want

09:02.667 --> 09:04.794
to hang around

09:04.836 --> 09:07.839
with some old person

09:04.836 --> 09:07.839
whose arm I had broken.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.008
(moaning)

09:13.303 --> 09:16.597
You're a mean,

09:13.303 --> 09:16.597
thoughtless little boy.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.640
Trying to make

09:16.639 --> 09:17.640
an old woman

09:17.682 --> 09:19.684
suffer more than

09:17.682 --> 09:19.684
she already has.

09:19.726 --> 09:20.810
Yes, ma'am.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.979
You're a nasty little

09:20.852 --> 09:22.979
liar, aren't you?

09:23.021 --> 09:26.191
Well, liar, you're the one

09:23.021 --> 09:26.191
that's going to suffer

09:26.233 --> 09:29.110
as soon as we pick up

09:26.233 --> 09:29.110
my prescription and get home.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.322
Ooh, damn cast itches

09:29.152 --> 09:32.322
like a Greek sailor.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.907
(car horn honks)

09:33.948 --> 09:36.617
Stop pawing at me!

09:36.659 --> 09:37.660
Hey, Dewey.

09:37.702 --> 09:38.786
You know what?

09:38.828 --> 09:39.871
I've been thinking.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.873
You know how

09:39.913 --> 09:41.873
I never give you anything

09:41.915 --> 09:43.333
for your birthday?

09:43.375 --> 09:44.418
Yeah...

09:44.459 --> 09:46.253
Well, here.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.254
Happy birthday!

09:47.295 --> 09:48.629
I already have

09:47.295 --> 09:48.629
a backpack.

09:48.671 --> 09:49.714
Not like this one.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.716
See, this one

09:49.756 --> 09:51.716
has a whistle.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.800
(blowing)

09:52.842 --> 09:54.219
Why are you flinching?

09:54.261 --> 09:55.636
I'm giving you

09:54.261 --> 09:55.636
something nice.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.637
But I'm not

09:55.678 --> 09:56.637
going to take it.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.639
Here, just hold it.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.639
No.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.559
Why won't you let me

09:58.681 --> 10:00.559
do something nice?!

10:00.600 --> 10:01.851
I don't want it!

10:01.893 --> 10:02.894
You're going to wear this

10:02.936 --> 10:04.687
and there's nothing

10:02.936 --> 10:04.687
you can do about it!

10:04.729 --> 10:06.940
Dad, you have to do

10:04.729 --> 10:06.940
something about Dewey

10:06.981 --> 10:08.358
taking Mom's purse to school.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.235
Don't worry, son,

10:08.400 --> 10:10.235
it's just a phase.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.653
Aren't you worried about

10:10.277 --> 10:12.653
how this reflects

10:10.277 --> 10:12.653
on you as a parent?

10:12.695 --> 10:15.031
Reese, one boy's purse

10:12.695 --> 10:15.031
is another boy's book bag...

10:15.073 --> 10:16.116
if he's European.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.951
Besides, I can't tell you

10:16.157 --> 10:17.951
how many times

10:17.992 --> 10:20.328
I've been jealous of your mother

10:17.992 --> 10:20.328
and her purse.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.456
You know, we men have

10:20.370 --> 10:22.456
to shove our whole lives

10:22.497 --> 10:25.333
in a little square of leather

10:22.497 --> 10:25.333
that we then have to sit on.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.668
I'm not saying

10:25.375 --> 10:27.668
that I condone it,

10:27.710 --> 10:30.046
but I am saying,

10:27.710 --> 10:30.046
let Dewey have his purse.

10:30.088 --> 10:33.716
Perhaps he'll blaze a trail

10:30.088 --> 10:33.716
for the rest of us.

10:33.758 --> 10:37.678
I don't think these

10:33.758 --> 10:37.678
new pills are working.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.889
I keep taking them

10:39.931 --> 10:42.267
and I don't feel anything.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.770
Don't be stingy

10:42.309 --> 10:45.770
with that lotion.

10:45.812 --> 10:50.525
You're going to need a knife

10:45.812 --> 10:50.525
when you get to the corns.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.152
If I didn't know any better,

10:52.193 --> 10:55.905
I'd say that new doctor

10:52.193 --> 10:55.905
was Hungarian.

10:55.947 --> 10:58.325
Dr. Freeman.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.284
Freeman.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.411
Ha.

11:01.453 --> 11:04.498
If that's not an Ellis Island

11:01.453 --> 11:04.498
hand-me-down,

11:04.539 --> 11:08.293
I'll eat my Sunday hat.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.128
I don't think

11:08.335 --> 11:10.128
you're supposed to take

11:10.170 --> 11:11.546
those pills

11:10.170 --> 11:11.546
with alcohol.

11:11.588 --> 11:15.175
Ooh, now you're worried

11:11.588 --> 11:15.175
about me.

11:15.216 --> 11:18.386
Where was that

11:15.216 --> 11:18.386
when you broke this arm?

11:18.428 --> 11:19.720
You're just like that...

11:19.762 --> 11:23.141
that nosy Kraut

11:19.762 --> 11:23.141
cleaning lady of mine.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.185
Your hands are similar, too.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.728
Small.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.606
Like a girl's.

11:31.774 --> 11:32.942
Okay, that's enough.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.444
You're a horrible person

11:34.486 --> 11:35.736
and I hate you!

11:35.778 --> 11:37.905
I know I'm not supposed

11:35.778 --> 11:37.905
to hate people,

11:37.947 --> 11:40.534
but if anybody should be hated,

11:37.947 --> 11:40.534
it's you!

11:40.575 --> 11:42.410
(snoring)

11:46.789 --> 11:48.249
It's a good thing

11:46.789 --> 11:48.249
you called us.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.750
How long has she

11:48.291 --> 11:49.750
been like this?

11:49.792 --> 11:51.461
Hours.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.838
She passes out for awhile,

11:51.503 --> 11:53.838
wakes up, takes more pills,

11:53.880 --> 11:55.215
and passes out again.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.342
Pernabutol.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.342
What's the dosage?

11:57.384 --> 11:58.759
Hundred milligrams,

11:57.384 --> 11:58.759
two by three.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.262
She taking Fermatram

11:58.801 --> 12:01.262
with that?

12:01.304 --> 12:02.389
I doubt it.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.765
That's been contraindicated

12:02.430 --> 12:04.765
since '87.

12:04.807 --> 12:08.562
No, this seems like a

12:04.807 --> 12:08.562
pretty straightforward

12:04.807 --> 12:08.562
alcohol/sedative reaction.

12:08.603 --> 12:09.563
Absolutely.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.606
If she's anything

12:09.604 --> 12:11.606
like my mom,

12:11.648 --> 12:13.650
Mrs. Griffin will be knocked

12:11.648 --> 12:13.650
loopy

12:13.692 --> 12:15.776
for the next three

12:13.692 --> 12:15.776
and a half hours.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.778
We're completely

12:15.818 --> 12:17.778
unsupervised.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.072
Are you thinking

12:19.113 --> 12:20.823
what I'm thinking?

12:24.494 --> 12:26.496
(playing ragtime music)

12:31.418 --> 12:32.835
Is this what  you

12:31.418 --> 12:32.835
were thinking?

12:32.877 --> 12:34.212
Not even remotely.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.881
I was thinking more

12:34.254 --> 12:36.881
along the lines of...

12:42.845 --> 12:44.805
Why doesn't he have

12:42.845 --> 12:44.805
to cut his hair?

12:44.847 --> 12:46.516
I don't know.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.727
Why does Spangler let him

12:46.558 --> 12:48.727
wear a bathrobe to class?

12:48.767 --> 12:49.810
I don't know.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.062
Maybe he saved

12:49.852 --> 12:51.062
Spangler's life.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.022
He didn't save

12:51.104 --> 12:53.022
Spangler's life.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.816
Well, it's got to be

12:53.064 --> 12:55.816
something, because

12:53.064 --> 12:55.816
it's just not right.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.653
Richie.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.238
Take a quarter from me.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.698
Thanks, Chief.

13:01.740 --> 13:02.823
No problem, Richie.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.825
You guys talking

13:02.865 --> 13:04.825
about Spangler's son?

13:04.867 --> 13:06.244
He's not Spangler's son.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.995
I grew up with him.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.995
He's a screwup.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.831
He's a slack dumbass

13:08.037 --> 13:10.831
who lives in his

13:08.037 --> 13:10.831
mother's basement.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.083
It's got to be Spangler.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.627
He must be mellowing.

13:13.668 --> 13:14.835
CADET:

13:13.668 --> 13:14.835
Sir!

13:14.877 --> 13:16.254
Sir!

13:16.296 --> 13:18.673
Cadets.

13:18.715 --> 13:19.798
What's up, Chief?

13:26.973 --> 13:28.516
LLOYD:

13:26.973 --> 13:28.516
I've been onto you

13:26.973 --> 13:28.516
from the start.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.851
Not once did you pull

13:28.558 --> 13:30.851
any wool

13:30.893 --> 13:32.937
over this boy's eyes.

13:32.979 --> 13:36.065
You come in here,

13:32.979 --> 13:36.065
put a paper lantern

13:32.979 --> 13:36.065
around a lightbulb

13:36.107 --> 13:38.901
and, lo and behold, you're

13:36.107 --> 13:38.901
the Queen of the Nile.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.361
I say ha!

13:40.403 --> 13:42.489
(Southern accent):

13:40.403 --> 13:42.489
I've always depended

13:42.530 --> 13:45.450
on the kindness of strangers.

13:45.492 --> 13:49.120
Stella!

13:50.913 --> 13:52.666
Whoo! Yeah!

13:52.707 --> 13:54.167
That was great!

13:54.208 --> 13:56.294
What's next?

13:56.336 --> 13:57.587
I have no idea.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.880
We've done everything

13:57.629 --> 13:59.880
we can do in this house.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.800
It can't be over.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.800
Come on, think.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.595
With our brains and

14:01.840 --> 14:05.595
your gift for reckless,

14:01.840 --> 14:05.595
antisocial behavior

14:05.637 --> 14:08.222
there's got to be

14:05.637 --> 14:08.222
something else we can do.

14:09.724 --> 14:12.893
I've never

14:09.724 --> 14:12.893
felt more alive.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.605
We're outlaws. Whoo!

14:15.647 --> 14:16.939
This rocks!

14:16.981 --> 14:19.942
Hey, I think 45 minutes

14:16.981 --> 14:19.942
of rubbing out corns

14:19.984 --> 14:22.362
is worth at least

14:19.984 --> 14:22.362
an hour joyride.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.905
At the best, you ignored us.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.492
At the worst, you tormented us.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.910
Now, the tables have turned.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.331
The Krelboynes are mobile.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.417
Behold our derring-do!

14:37.585 --> 14:38.628
What?

14:38.670 --> 14:40.338
What's going on?

14:58.815 --> 15:00.149
She saw me.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.401
I am so dead.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.943
We're all dead.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.863
I'm not going to get

15:02.985 --> 15:04.863
into a good college.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.447
Mom is going to kill me.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.157
We should just end this.

15:08.199 --> 15:11.786
We should drive off a cliff,

15:08.199 --> 15:11.786
like Thelma and Louise.

15:11.828 --> 15:15.164
Why does everything end in

15:11.828 --> 15:15.164
a group suicide with you?

15:15.206 --> 15:16.957
Okay, okay.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.957
Stop panicking.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.794
Let's all just calm down,

15:16.999 --> 15:19.794
and think about this, okay?

15:19.836 --> 15:22.046
Okay, first of all, I don't

15:19.836 --> 15:22.046
think she saw you guys.

15:22.088 --> 15:25.007
So there's no reason we all

15:22.088 --> 15:25.007
should get in trouble, and...

15:25.049 --> 15:26.634
Guys?

15:32.014 --> 15:34.350
Stevie, want some help?

15:34.392 --> 15:37.061
Pop... the trunk.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.688
(knock at door)

15:38.730 --> 15:40.273
Entrez.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.983
Sir, it's about Richie.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.983
Is he all right?

15:43.025 --> 15:44.861
He's more than all

15:43.025 --> 15:44.861
right, he's in heaven.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.987
Don't you think you've been

15:44.903 --> 15:46.987
letting him slide a little?

15:47.029 --> 15:49.198
Yes.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.198
You're letting him

15:47.029 --> 15:49.198
get away with murder.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.241
I certainly am.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.785
Are you aware that he thinks

15:51.826 --> 15:53.202
he's immune to any punishment?

15:53.244 --> 15:54.995
That he can do

15:53.244 --> 15:54.995
whatever he wants?

15:55.037 --> 15:56.664
I am, and he can.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.207
Sir...

15:58.249 --> 16:00.293
are you just messing

15:58.249 --> 16:00.293
with my head?

16:00.334 --> 16:03.003
It's not always

16:00.334 --> 16:03.003
about  you,  Cadet.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.881
Well, then, what is it?

16:06.925 --> 16:10.720
Francis, I'm not an idiot.

16:10.762 --> 16:14.014
Don't you think that I know

16:10.762 --> 16:14.014
Richie is a moron?

16:14.056 --> 16:15.266
Hell, he is a cancer.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.518
He is a cancer to be eradicated.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.855
If Richie's attitude spread

16:17.560 --> 16:20.855
to the other cadets,

16:20.897 --> 16:24.024
there's no telling

16:20.897 --> 16:24.024
what it would do to Marlin.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.193
What do you mean?

16:24.066 --> 16:26.193
You're treating

16:24.066 --> 16:26.193
him like a god.

16:26.235 --> 16:29.948
And that makes the other

16:26.235 --> 16:29.948
cadets furious, doesn't it?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.116
It makes them want

16:29.989 --> 16:32.116
to hurt him...

16:32.158 --> 16:34.118
to hurt your

16:32.158 --> 16:34.118
little friend?

16:34.160 --> 16:36.871
Wait a minute... you're

16:34.160 --> 16:36.871
turning us against him.

16:36.913 --> 16:39.332
You want us to get rid

16:36.913 --> 16:39.332
of Richie ourselves.

16:39.373 --> 16:42.042
Bravo, Cadet.

16:42.084 --> 16:45.880
You see, every threat to Marlin

16:42.084 --> 16:45.880
must be treated differently.

16:45.922 --> 16:49.049
You, Francis, had to be

16:45.922 --> 16:49.049
beaten down, like a dog.

16:49.091 --> 16:52.971
Richie is being killed

16:49.091 --> 16:52.971
with kindness...

16:53.012 --> 16:57.057
or at least pummeled

16:53.012 --> 16:57.057
into unconsciousness.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.059
Oh, that is pretty clever, sir.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.980
But what makes you think

16:59.101 --> 17:01.980
I won't just tell Richie

17:02.021 --> 17:03.105
about your plan?

17:03.147 --> 17:04.273
Oh, feel free.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.066
But I don't think you will.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.068
He's my best friend.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.068
Why wouldn't I tell him?

17:08.110 --> 17:09.529
Because you hate him, too.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.072
You're resentful

17:09.570 --> 17:12.072
of all the special privileges

17:12.114 --> 17:14.074
that he gets--

17:12.114 --> 17:14.074
the expensive dinners,

17:14.116 --> 17:16.076
the use

17:14.116 --> 17:16.076
of the Academy golf cart...

17:16.118 --> 17:18.078
the way he gets shiatsu massages

17:18.120 --> 17:20.080
when the rest of you

17:18.120 --> 17:20.080
are suffering

17:20.122 --> 17:21.332
through survival training.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.542
That doesn't matter.

17:22.583 --> 17:23.960
Of course I would tell him.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.378
I would be a traitor

17:24.002 --> 17:25.378
if I didn't.

17:25.419 --> 17:28.130
You would be, wouldn't you?

17:31.634 --> 17:33.093
Richie...

17:33.135 --> 17:34.470
No time to talk, man.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.096
Wait, this is important.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.097
Dude, watch it.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.099
This shirt was a

17:37.139 --> 17:39.099
gift from Edwin.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.100
It cost 200 bucks.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.102
Richie, I'm trying

17:40.142 --> 17:42.102
to tell you something.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.730
Well, you'd better

17:42.144 --> 17:43.730
say it quick.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.940
Edwin'll freak if I'm

17:43.771 --> 17:45.940
late for the match.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.401
We've got early dinner

17:45.982 --> 17:48.401
reservations.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.610
You know what?

17:49.652 --> 17:50.904
It can wait.

17:50.945 --> 17:51.946
Fine.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.116
No, wait.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.493
I have to tell you this.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.120
You're my friend,

17:57.535 --> 18:00.120
and I owe it to you.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.748
Spangler is only

18:00.162 --> 18:01.748
being nice to you

18:01.789 --> 18:04.375
so that we all hate you

18:01.789 --> 18:04.375
and beat the snot out of you.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.544
I can't believe it.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.962
I know.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.548
You're jealous of me

18:08.004 --> 18:10.548
and Edwin being buds,

18:10.590 --> 18:13.509
so you're trying to shove

18:10.590 --> 18:13.509
a wedge between us.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.720
That's sad, man.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.138
Just remember

18:15.762 --> 18:18.138
I told you.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.139
Whatever, man.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.935
Sour grapes.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.143
But I told you.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.103
Whatever.

18:25.396 --> 18:28.733
RICHIE:

18:25.396 --> 18:28.733
Hey, dudes, cool hoods.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.151
(punching

18:28.775 --> 18:31.151
and grunting)

18:31.193 --> 18:33.195
Ow!

18:33.237 --> 18:34.363
(gasps)

18:34.405 --> 18:35.615
Think! Think!

18:35.656 --> 18:37.075
I'm a genius.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.660
I can think of something.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.621
Why can't I think of something?

18:41.662 --> 18:45.165
Where you been,

18:41.662 --> 18:45.165
car thief?

18:45.207 --> 18:47.418
Come back to steal my jewelry?

18:47.460 --> 18:48.628
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.212
It was a horrible mistake.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.840
I don't know why I would do

18:50.254 --> 18:52.840
something so stupid,

18:52.882 --> 18:54.174
but I did and I'm sorry.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.218
(brakes screech)

18:56.260 --> 18:58.054
Oh, my God,

18:56.260 --> 18:58.054
my mom's here.

18:58.096 --> 19:00.014
What am I going to do?

19:01.599 --> 19:03.893
You're a good lady.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.893
You're a good person.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.645
Please, if you have any shred

19:03.935 --> 19:05.645
of decency

19:05.686 --> 19:07.354
you'll give me a five-second

19:05.686 --> 19:07.354
head start

19:07.396 --> 19:09.065
so I can head towards Mexico.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.650
(knock at door)

19:10.691 --> 19:12.192
Please, I'm begging you.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.278
You don't know

19:12.234 --> 19:14.278
what she's capable of.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.155
(knocking continues)

19:18.908 --> 19:20.868
Malcolm, get your things.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.868
We're going home.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.202
I am so sorry

19:20.910 --> 19:22.202
for all of this.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.496
Sorry for what?

19:23.537 --> 19:24.622
My son stole

19:23.537 --> 19:24.622
your car...

19:24.664 --> 19:26.206
and he was out

19:24.664 --> 19:26.206
joyriding in it.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.374
Joyriding?

19:27.416 --> 19:28.876
That was no joyride for me.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.129
I was passed out

19:28.918 --> 19:31.129
in the backseat.

19:31.170 --> 19:31.879
What?

19:31.921 --> 19:33.422
I made a mistake

19:33.464 --> 19:35.842
with my medication,

19:33.464 --> 19:35.842
and he drove me to the hospital.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.259
Huh?

19:37.301 --> 19:40.220
He was driving you

19:37.301 --> 19:40.220
to the hospital?

19:40.262 --> 19:42.140
Yes, who else is

19:40.262 --> 19:42.140
going to do it?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.224
I'm just an old woman.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.224
I live alone.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.602
Malcolm, when there's

19:44.266 --> 19:46.602
an emergency,

19:46.644 --> 19:48.228
you should come to  us.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.897
Yeah, you're right.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.025
I don't know

19:49.939 --> 19:52.025
what I was thinking.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.109
Because I

19:52.066 --> 19:53.109
wasn't thinking

19:53.151 --> 19:55.945
and I just did it.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.237
I'm sorry.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.323
And I... yeah.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.284
Well, it was

19:59.365 --> 20:02.284
pretty quick thinking.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.911
He's a good boy.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.497
I don't know what

20:03.953 --> 20:06.497
I would have done

20:03.953 --> 20:06.497
without him.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.498
Thanks.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.249
In fact, he's so kind...

20:09.291 --> 20:11.544
he offered to come

20:09.291 --> 20:11.544
help me  before  school

20:11.585 --> 20:13.004
every day, too.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.756
Before school?

20:15.798 --> 20:16.924
Really?

20:16.966 --> 20:19.301
I thought that was

20:16.966 --> 20:19.301
too much, too.

20:19.343 --> 20:22.930
Especially since these

20:19.343 --> 20:22.930
old bones heal  so slowly...

20:22.972 --> 20:24.390
it'll be months.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.434
But he insisted.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.645
Didn't you?

20:29.687 --> 20:31.313
Yeah.

20:31.355 --> 20:34.274
Ooh, these corns

20:31.355 --> 20:34.274
are burning.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.819
You'd better go

20:34.316 --> 20:36.819
get the lotion.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.156
Well, I'll leave

20:37.904 --> 20:40.156
you to your work.

20:40.198 --> 20:42.783
Guess you won't be

20:40.198 --> 20:42.783
coming home for supper.

20:42.825 --> 20:45.912
And to think, I was all

20:42.825 --> 20:45.912
ready to punish you.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.292
Don't just stand

20:50.583 --> 20:52.292
there, thief.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.253
Let's go.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.297
Hey!

20:57.339 --> 20:59.092
Here's your stupid

20:57.339 --> 20:59.092
backpack back.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.760
BOY:

20:59.133 --> 21:00.760
What's up with

20:59.133 --> 21:00.760
the flower field?

21:00.801 --> 21:02.803
Hey, Percy, I

21:00.801 --> 21:02.803
love your purse.

21:02.845 --> 21:05.305
It's for his own good.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.766
It's a book bag.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.308
It's a girl's purse.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.309
That makes you a girl.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.310
No, it doesn't.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.938
Are you calling me a liar?

21:12.521 --> 21:13.522
Aah!

21:12.521 --> 21:13.522
Get him!

21:14.232 --> 21:15.149
(groans)

21:17.276 --> 21:19.319
(groans)

21:25.534 --> 21:27.286
Nice!
