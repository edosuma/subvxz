WEBVTT

00:07.175 --> 00:08.576
Oh, you just
heard gossip.

00:08.642 --> 00:09.543
No, I didn't.

00:09.610 --> 00:10.411
Yes, you did.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.080
I know your
gossip face.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.381
Gossip and turkey pastrami.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.815
It's gonna be a great night.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.350
No!
Tell it.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.585
Burt, I...
Spill it.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.087
I promised...
Don't fight it; let it out.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.089
Ah! Fine, but you can't
tell anyone else.

00:23.657 --> 00:24.625
(groans):
Ah!

00:24.692 --> 00:25.726
We swim in that pool!

00:25.793 --> 00:26.927
I know, right?

00:26.994 --> 00:28.096
Wha-- you know what?

00:28.162 --> 00:29.363
Nothing.

00:29.430 --> 00:30.931
Oh, you got gossip. Come on.

00:30.998 --> 00:32.400
No. Stop!
Tell it.

00:32.466 --> 00:33.501
Let it out, let it out,
let it out.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.868
Damn it!

00:34.935 --> 00:36.437
Dancin' Dan and Whistlin' Sue

00:36.504 --> 00:38.206
have been hooking up
at the rec center.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.774
I found out from
Government Conspiracy Gordon.

00:40.841 --> 00:44.678
Boy, the homeless people in
this town have great nicknames.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.182
* Whoo! *

00:48.249 --> 00:52.520
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

00:59.760 --> 01:02.763
Morning, Mrs. Chance,
Mr. Chance.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.432
Hey, Tyler, what's up?

01:04.498 --> 01:07.268
Still reeling from
that 13th astrological sign.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.837
Kind of need to reevaluate
a lot of things

01:09.903 --> 01:11.339
and remove a tattoo.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.607
I think he meant what's
up with the wrench.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.276
Oh, yeah!

01:15.343 --> 01:17.345
I am so, so sorry
to bother you,

01:17.411 --> 01:19.313
but I have to shut off your gas.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.215
The gas bill
cannot be overdue.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.983
I always go into the
check cashing place

01:23.050 --> 01:25.619
next door to the pharmacy and
I pay it while I'm waiting

01:25.686 --> 01:27.421
for them to refill Maw
Maw's prescription.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.557
And I always remember
to get her new pills

01:29.623 --> 01:32.226
when I have to go into the
bathroom cupboard for a tampon.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.195
And since my friend
has not arrived yet,

01:34.262 --> 01:36.197
the gas bill cannot be late.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.432
It says here
you're two weeks late.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.838
Oh, good Lord,
I'm two weeks late!

01:44.905 --> 01:47.141
You mean late late?

01:47.208 --> 01:49.743
Like, late late?

01:51.179 --> 01:52.546
You know what?

01:53.581 --> 01:55.082
I'm just gonna
check this box

01:55.149 --> 01:56.984
that says
"loose dog in the yard."

01:57.050 --> 02:00.254
That should buy you
about a week or two.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.889
BURT:
Man, this is crazy.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.123
We're always so careful.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.493
Sometimes we're so careful,
it's not even that fun.

02:05.559 --> 02:06.460
(sighs)

02:06.527 --> 02:08.128
The drive-through car wash.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.930
Oh, man.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.532
That was so beautiful though

02:11.599 --> 02:13.767
with the multicolored soap
running down the windows.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.303
What are we gonna do?

02:15.369 --> 02:17.205
We cannot afford...

02:17.271 --> 02:19.407
...Fairlane.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.276
I am telling you,
Ford Fairlane

02:22.343 --> 02:24.545
is Andrew Dice
Clay's best movie.

02:24.612 --> 02:25.679
How can you
say that?

02:25.746 --> 02:27.080
He was in
Pretty in Pink.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.649
Uh, doesn't count.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.451
He wasn't
Andrew Dice Clay then.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.820
Jimmy, back me
up on this.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.055
Dad, I've told you
a hundred times,

02:35.122 --> 02:38.492
I have no idea
who Andrew Dice Clay is.

02:42.129 --> 02:43.797
Nice job covering.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.233
Oh, my God, Burt.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.167
We cannot have another baby.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.902
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's-Let's not freak out

02:48.969 --> 02:50.838
until we know for sure.
You're right.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.773
But still, Jimmy cannot
find out about this.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.841
I love making fun of

02:53.907 --> 02:55.309
his unplanned pregnancy.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.977
I don't want to lose that.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.212
Yeah, we can't just go back to

02:58.279 --> 02:59.513
making fun of
his stupid T-shirts.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.114
It's not as rich an area.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.450
I'll go to
the free clinic today,

03:02.516 --> 03:03.917
and I'll find out
what's going on.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.920
Until then, mum's the word.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.590
Got it.

03:09.657 --> 03:12.626
Why does my room
smell like old people?

03:13.961 --> 03:16.664
Because yesterday we let
an old person go in there.

03:16.730 --> 03:17.898
Oh.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.667
Thank God. I thought it was me.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.407
(cell phone ringing)

03:26.474 --> 03:29.377
Hey, would you
grab that for me?

03:32.112 --> 03:33.314
"Free clinic"? Why is the...

03:33.381 --> 03:34.548
I got it!

03:34.615 --> 03:36.083
(chuckles)

03:36.149 --> 03:37.685
Hello.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.521
Hey. Uh, I'm filling out
this form at the free clinic,

03:40.588 --> 03:42.556
and I need to know
your mother's maiden name.

03:42.623 --> 03:43.791
Chance.

03:43.857 --> 03:44.658
No, her maiden name.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.093
Like, before she was married.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.094
Chance.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.095
Really?

03:48.161 --> 03:49.397
Wow.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.065
Third cousins, big drinkers,
things happen.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.501
Okay, then.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.968
I'll call you
when I know something.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.104
Okay.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.406
What was that?

03:58.472 --> 03:59.407
Wrong number.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.608
It said "free clinic,"

04:00.674 --> 04:02.310
and it took too long
for a wrong number.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.412
Yeah, well, I like
human contact, Jimmy.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.046
Dog contact, too.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.281
Cats are good.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.282
Birds make me nervous.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.484
(leaf blower buzzing)

04:13.854 --> 04:14.922
When can she be here?
(baby fussing)

04:14.988 --> 04:15.756
Yeah, I have to go.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.124
I have to
call you back.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.460
Jesse! You want me
to come back there?
Excuse me.

04:19.527 --> 04:20.794
I've been sitting,
waiting for my results...

04:20.861 --> 04:22.363
We were just about
to call you back.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.765
Uh, please take a seat
in area seven, okay?

04:31.339 --> 04:33.341
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

04:35.309 --> 04:36.810
Hey.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.246
Oh. Hey!

04:39.313 --> 04:41.281
You here for
the-the flu shot, too?

04:41.349 --> 04:43.884
Yes, I am. Yeah.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.720
Don't have to be a bird to
get the bird flu. (chuckles)

04:46.787 --> 04:48.356
Or so they say
in the pamphlets.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.523
(both chuckle)

04:51.425 --> 04:53.060
Good news. You're not pregnant.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.194
(sighs)

04:54.261 --> 04:55.696
Here's a pamphlet
describing over

04:55.763 --> 04:57.565
20 kinds of birth control
we can provide to you.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.066
Seven of which
have not worked for me.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.505
Well, we got the same result

05:04.572 --> 05:06.374
from the pregnancy
test you took at home:

05:06.440 --> 05:07.775
inconclusive.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.109
I say, wait
five more days

05:09.176 --> 05:10.944
and try the home test again.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.990
Sorry I lied. It's just
that we didn't tell Jimmy.

05:23.056 --> 05:26.660
It would be really bad
for me if he found out,

05:26.727 --> 05:28.596
and I didn't want to
burden you with my secret.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.598
Oh, no, no, no,
I totally understand.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.433
I don't want everybody
at the grocery store

05:32.500 --> 05:33.801
gossiping about my business.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.503
I'd really appreciate it
if you just

05:35.569 --> 05:37.938
didn't mention my thing
to Jimmy either.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.376
Okay?

05:42.443 --> 05:44.945
I'd like to.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.514
I really would.

05:46.580 --> 05:50.418
But I'm not great at
holding on to gossip, so...

05:50.484 --> 05:51.919
How hard can it be?

05:51.985 --> 05:54.321
You're an adult;
just don't say anything.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.023
But Burt and
Jimmy always know

05:56.089 --> 05:58.058
when I've got
something really juicy.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.327
Plus, I got to be honest,
after cleaning toilets

06:00.394 --> 06:04.965
all day, delivering gossip
just makes me feel special.

06:05.032 --> 06:05.866
You know?

06:05.933 --> 06:08.469
Like those cool
scumbags on TMZ.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.737
But you don't want
Jimmy to find out

06:09.803 --> 06:11.972
about your pregnancy scare,
right?

06:12.039 --> 06:13.040
(chuckles):
God, no.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.575
That would be awful.
Okay.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.710
Well, if you blab my secret,
I'll blab yours.

06:16.777 --> 06:20.280
Are you blackmailing me?

06:20.347 --> 06:23.551
I guess I am, yeah.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.186
Damn, I like you.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.656
Is someone sick?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.824
No! I told you, no.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.726
Then just tell me
why the free clinic called,

06:32.793 --> 06:33.927
and I'll leave you alone.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.963
Fine.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.865
I'm donating a kidney
to the mayor.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.401
Why would you be giving
a kidney to the mayor?

06:41.469 --> 06:42.903
You voted for the other guy.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.473
Can't you put petty politics
aside for one day, Jimmy?

06:45.539 --> 06:47.074
The man's life is at stake.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.308
The mayor's a woman.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.110
Can't you just let me have this?

06:50.177 --> 06:52.680
This is as close as I'll
ever get to being mayor!

06:52.746 --> 06:55.415
I'm not letting this go!

06:55.483 --> 06:57.618
(phone ringing)

07:01.354 --> 07:02.823
(quietly):
Hello?

07:02.890 --> 07:04.458
Burt, it's negative.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.893
I'm not pregnant!

07:05.959 --> 07:06.760
Mom?

07:06.827 --> 07:08.228
Why would you be pregnant?

07:08.295 --> 07:10.598
(deep voice):
No es mommy. Estoy Rosa.

07:10.664 --> 07:11.932
It's my phone!

07:11.999 --> 07:14.735
Don't answer
my phone!

07:14.802 --> 07:17.905
Do you have any idea
how crazy your behavior was?

07:17.971 --> 07:20.107
You already had
one giant mistake,

07:20.173 --> 07:22.610
me-- wasn't that enough
to teach you? Huh?

07:22.676 --> 07:25.078
I mean, it's not like
we have enough space or
money for another kid.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.615
How could you be
so unresponsible?

07:27.681 --> 07:29.717
We're responsible.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.586
We're just also
passionate and spontaneous.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.087
Those would be
our gladiator names

07:34.154 --> 07:36.056
if we were on
American Gladiator.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.591
Which we still might do.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.259
Because we're spontaneous.

07:39.326 --> 07:42.462
Okay, first of all,
Gladiator sounds awesome.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.364
But no babies.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.466
One of you has
to get fixed or spayed.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.535
No way.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.169
You cannot decide
that, Jimmy.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.638
That is a personal decision.

07:50.704 --> 07:51.772
She's right.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.641
I think we should
take a family vote.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.975
All those in favor

07:55.042 --> 07:56.810
of everyone keeping
their original plumbing?

07:57.978 --> 07:58.912
VIRGINIA:
Sorry, Jimmy,

07:58.979 --> 08:00.480
you're outvoted
two to one.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.149
MAW MAW:
I vote with Jimmy.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.851
Hold on.
Two to two.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.786
Only if
she's lucid.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.054
She's only allowed to
vote if she's lucid.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.155
Maw Maw...

08:08.221 --> 08:11.391
we are currently at war
with what country?

08:11.458 --> 08:13.727
Iraq and Afghanistan.

08:15.028 --> 08:15.996
Is she right?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.865
I think so, but
I'm not sure.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.733
It's right, you morons.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.302
One more reason why
you shouldn't have another baby.

08:22.369 --> 08:25.205
Look, we're five people

08:25.272 --> 08:27.240
living in a four-person house.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.809
We need another baby

08:28.876 --> 08:31.579
like we need a gorilla
throwing fireworks.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.615
I change my vote.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.584
What? Now you're
on their side?

08:36.650 --> 08:38.251
It's not a horrible idea.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.454
And she's right--
another baby would not
be good for any of us.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.857
Yes! That's three votes--
now we just have to decide...

08:43.924 --> 08:45.292
Not it!
Not it!
Tie.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.060
We'll have to do a coin toss.
Mom, call it.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.829
Okay, heads, I win,
tails, you lose?

08:48.896 --> 08:50.297
BURT:
Uh, uh...

08:52.666 --> 08:54.134
Tails, you lose.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.468
Damn it!

08:55.535 --> 08:56.870
I never win coin tosses!

09:05.846 --> 09:07.047
(whispers):
We got a problem.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.582
What?

09:08.649 --> 09:10.250
VIRGINIA:
This morning I realized

09:10.317 --> 09:12.820
that Jimmy found out
about my pregnancy scare,

09:12.886 --> 09:14.287
and there was
absolutely nothing

09:14.354 --> 09:16.957
to keep me from
telling him your secret.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.692
How are we supposed
to pay for this?

09:18.759 --> 09:20.794
I found a doctor who
agreed to do it for free

09:20.861 --> 09:22.429
if we clean his pool
for a year.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.832
VIRGINIA:
I knew I had
to get out of there

09:24.898 --> 09:28.736
before they saw my face, but my
car keys were in the kitchen.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.070
How big's his pool?

09:30.137 --> 09:31.071
Medium size.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.040
So am I.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.474
Sounds fair.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.076
BURT:
Just don't tell me
when it is-- too stressful.

09:36.143 --> 09:39.112
Just pick a date
and surprise me.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.917
I'm not gonna be able
to keep your secret.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.687
If they had seen my face,
it'd already be out.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.789
Then you need to tell
me another secret.

09:48.856 --> 09:51.324
Something good
and juicy,

09:51.391 --> 09:52.726
you know, like a...

09:52.793 --> 09:55.295
a summer camp sexual
experimentation secret.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.799
Did you just tell
me another secret?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.401
No.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.203
All right.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.208
This truly is

10:08.275 --> 10:11.511
my deepest, darkest secret.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.346
Okay.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.917
There is a sex tape of me and
Burt floating around town,

10:16.984 --> 10:18.952
and he doesn't
know about it.
Wow!

10:19.019 --> 10:21.054
You guys are a regular
Pam and Tommy Lee.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.155
Oh, no.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.057
Don't get me wrong,
Burt's no slouch,

10:24.124 --> 10:26.159
but he can't steer a boat.
(chuckles)

10:26.226 --> 10:29.462
Anyway, about five
years ago, me and Burt
were having a fight,

10:29.529 --> 10:32.966
so I gave away his
bootleg copy of Fast
and the Furious,

10:33.033 --> 10:35.035
only the tapes
got switched,

10:35.102 --> 10:37.637
and I gave away
our sex tape.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.439
Okay. Great.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.508
Now, picture me telling Burt.

10:41.574 --> 10:42.910
I'd be mortified.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.279
Damn, you're good with
this blackmail thing.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.716
I really think
we can be friends.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.554
BURT:
Oh, this is gonna be so sweet!

10:54.621 --> 10:58.058
We've hardly been to the Arcade
at all since Hope was born.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.694
Surprise--
it's vasectomy day.
Aw, damn it!

11:00.761 --> 11:04.131
I knew when you told me
to wear my good underwear
to play Asteroids...

11:04.197 --> 11:04.998
something was up!

11:05.065 --> 11:06.499
(grunting)
(shrieks)

11:06.566 --> 11:09.770
After the local anesthetic
has numbed the area,

11:09.837 --> 11:12.072
I'll make one or two
small incisions

11:12.139 --> 11:14.908
from which I will
disconnect the gonads.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.977
Who are they?
The gonads.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.546
Your boys, your plums,
you know, family jewels.

11:19.612 --> 11:20.613
No.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.015
(whispers):
Who are they?

11:22.082 --> 11:23.350
Oh, oh,

11:23.416 --> 11:24.818
those are my students.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.720
I teach English as
a second language

11:26.787 --> 11:28.121
at the community
center. Guys, come

11:28.188 --> 11:30.623
a little bit closer-- I want
you to get a better look.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.691
Now, this...

11:31.759 --> 11:33.526
is a penis.
I am out of here.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.128
Dad, we had a deal.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.497
Yep, yep, it's a deal
you're not backing out of.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.968
My pool's not turning green
just because you're getting
a case of cold walnuts.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.569
Jimmy, give me my pants;
I can't do this.

11:42.635 --> 11:43.771
Nuh-uh.
DOCTOR:
Mr. Chance,

11:43.837 --> 11:44.704
would you like a breath mint?

11:44.772 --> 11:45.973
Yeah.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.477
Oh, this tastes awful.
Oh, that's because
it's a sedative.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.578
In about five minutes,

11:51.644 --> 11:53.747
you'll let me do
anything I want down there.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.149
And that's how easy
it is to get roofied.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.451
That should act as
a cautionary lesson--

11:58.518 --> 12:01.889
for the girls, not
as an instructional
lesson for the guys.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.057
(nervous chuckle)

12:07.327 --> 12:09.129
Jimmy...

12:09.196 --> 12:11.231
you know how your mother and I

12:11.298 --> 12:13.500
always told you
that drugs were bad?

12:13.566 --> 12:16.403
Yeah.
We were wrong.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.939
This stuff's amazing.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.911
It's like I'm floating
and sinking at the same time.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.512
I'm flinking.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.782
Just do me a favor.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.450
(whispers):
Don't tell Jimmy.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.651
(whispers):
Okay.

12:31.718 --> 12:34.121
All righty.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.622
Let's get this started.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.224
Yeah.
First thing
I need to do

12:37.290 --> 12:39.526
is a little shaving
in the surgical area.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.028
Whoa, no, no, no, no.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.330
That's not gonna
happen, partner.
Well,

12:43.396 --> 12:45.632
if you're uncomfortable
with another man doing it,

12:45.698 --> 12:48.435
we could ask one of
my female students--
she's Asian.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.270
No! That would be worse!

12:50.337 --> 12:53.240
Only one woman shaves
me down there--
that's my wife.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.177
Only once.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.979
I wanted to see
what it looked like.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.381
I don't recommend it.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.550
Tell you what,
give me the razor--
I'll do it myself.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.753
No, no, no, I can't
give a razor to a man
who's on sedatives.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.088
How about him?
He'll do it.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.823
(nervous laugh)
Whoa, I don't think...

13:09.890 --> 13:11.959
Well, let's go home, then.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.962
(groans softly, chuckles)

13:15.028 --> 13:16.864
Ooh, that tickles.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.598
Oh, Dad, come on!

13:18.665 --> 13:20.133
Oh, sorry.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.870
I forgot that was you
down there for a second.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.539
It isn't so bad.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.977
They should have places
that do this in the mall.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.279
They could call it
Bush-Whackers.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.449
Hey, I know-- as soon as
you're finished, I'll do you.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.451
I'm good.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.387
(grunts)

13:40.453 --> 13:43.523
(chuckling):
Jimmy, I just realized...

13:43.590 --> 13:47.060
in a couple of days,
I'm gonna have a prickly pair.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.962
(chuckling)
That's great, Dad.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.463
Can't wait.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.832
Hey, buddy.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.202
You remember that time
you shaved me?

13:55.268 --> 13:56.703
Yes! Because I'm
still doing it.

13:56.769 --> 13:57.905
Ah, we got

13:57.971 --> 13:59.572
so many fun
times together.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.944
* *

14:04.011 --> 14:05.378
* People, let me tell you *

14:05.445 --> 14:07.280
* 'Bout my best friend *

14:07.347 --> 14:09.816
* He's a warmhearted person *

14:09.883 --> 14:12.552
-* Who'll love me to the end *
-(flatulence)

14:12.619 --> 14:15.688
(laughing)
* People let me tell you
'bout my best friend *

14:15.755 --> 14:17.657
* He's the one boy, cuddly toy *

14:17.724 --> 14:20.160
* My up, my down,
my pride and joy *

14:20.227 --> 14:22.195
* People, let me
tell you about him *

14:22.262 --> 14:24.031
* He's so much fun *

14:24.097 --> 14:25.765
* Whether we're talkin'
man to man *

14:25.832 --> 14:28.001
* Or whether we're talkin'
son to son *

14:28.068 --> 14:31.671
* 'Cause he's my best friend *

14:31.738 --> 14:33.006
* Yeah, he's my *

14:33.073 --> 14:34.942
-* Best friend *
-(flatulence)

14:35.008 --> 14:37.177
* La, ba-da, ba-da, ya *

14:37.244 --> 14:38.245
* Ba, da-ba *

14:38.311 --> 14:41.681
* Da, ya, ba-da, ba-da, ya *

14:41.748 --> 14:43.016
* Ba, da, ba-da... *

14:43.083 --> 14:44.985
(scatting continues)

14:45.052 --> 14:47.687
* *

14:47.754 --> 14:49.589
(imitates high-
pitched flatulence)

14:49.656 --> 14:51.891
(scatting)

14:51.959 --> 14:54.261
(song fading away)

14:54.327 --> 14:57.330
Oh, those were
good times.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.533
Hey, buddy, you remember
that time you shaved my...

15:00.600 --> 15:01.601
Please just stop talking.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.370
DOCTOR:
All right.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.373
Let's sever some vas deferens.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.407
Hey, Jimmy.

15:07.474 --> 15:08.441
Yeah?

15:08.508 --> 15:10.010
Pull my finger.

15:10.077 --> 15:10.978
I really don't think so.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.779
Come on, buddy.
No.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.382
I don't want to-- I had
to drag you in from the car,

15:15.448 --> 15:17.084
I had to hold you
down on the bed,

15:17.150 --> 15:18.151
I had to shave you

15:18.218 --> 15:19.919
below your waist.
I am not lifting,

15:19.987 --> 15:23.656
moving, tugging or pulling
anything else of yours today.

15:23.723 --> 15:26.559
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go to the bathroom

15:26.626 --> 15:27.827
and wash my eyes.

15:27.894 --> 15:30.030
(sighs)

15:32.532 --> 15:34.434
(door slams)

15:54.687 --> 15:57.124
(whispering):
We have another problem.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.261
Last night, we were having
a normal dinner:

16:01.328 --> 16:03.296
fish for Friday.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.365
For the first time in days,

16:05.432 --> 16:07.434
I actually forgot
about your situation.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.637
I could feel calm--
but I was too calm.

16:10.703 --> 16:13.606
So, anything interesting
happen to anyone today?

16:13.673 --> 16:14.974
Any gossip?

16:16.809 --> 16:17.877
He said "gossip"?

16:17.944 --> 16:18.911
Yes!
No.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.780
Yes!
God!
I know.

16:20.847 --> 16:22.249
Soon as I heard that,

16:22.315 --> 16:24.551
the gossip started
to fight its way out.

16:24.617 --> 16:27.154
I saw some pretty cool out-
of-state license plates today.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.355
(mouth full):
Do tell.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.822
Well, I saw this Alaskan one.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.424
I felt like I had an armadillo

16:31.491 --> 16:34.127
inside me trying
to claw its way out.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.029
I looked away,
and I kept telling myself...

16:36.096 --> 16:37.397
(whispers):
Sex tape. Sex tape.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.132
But then Hope
threw a curveball,

16:39.199 --> 16:40.900
and I was back
to thinking "baby."

16:40.967 --> 16:43.336
I just lost it!

16:44.537 --> 16:46.005
Oh, look.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.340
Look...

16:47.407 --> 16:48.575
she's got something.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.177
BURT:
Mama's got
a secret.
Mm-mm.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.878
No, I don't.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.012
Yes, you do.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.814
Come on, spill
it, spill it.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.349
JIMMY/BURT:
Spill it, spill it, spill it.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.317
JIMMY:
Just let it out...

16:57.384 --> 16:59.552
I lost our sex tape!

16:59.619 --> 17:02.355
You told your own secret?
I had to.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.425
They knew I had gossip,
and they weren't gonna stop
until I told them something.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.994
And the only other secret
I could think of other
than yours was mine.

17:08.061 --> 17:09.329
What was Burt's reaction?

17:09.396 --> 17:11.198
Not what I expected.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.833
(laughing)

17:13.900 --> 17:16.269
Somebody's sitting down
to watch Vin Diesel,

17:16.336 --> 17:18.338
and they're gonna see my wiener!

17:18.405 --> 17:20.507
(continues
laughing)

17:20.573 --> 17:23.576
'Cause it looks a little
like Vin Diesel. (laughing)

17:23.643 --> 17:25.845
So, what happened
with my secret?

17:25.912 --> 17:28.415
Nothing. I just bit my tongue
for the rest of the night.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.217
Look, it's still
bleeding a little.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.751
(disgusted groan)
But I can't

17:31.818 --> 17:34.187
do that every day, so, listen,
if you're really pregnant,

17:34.254 --> 17:35.622
we're just gonna have to agree

17:35.688 --> 17:37.424
to tell people sooner
rather than later.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.127
Well... I've been
putting this off,

17:40.193 --> 17:42.129
but... I guess it's time.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.164
Let's go.

17:45.632 --> 17:46.866
(pounding on door)

17:46.933 --> 17:49.769
Someone's in here.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.207
Sabrina, hurry.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.675
They were giving out
coffee samples

17:55.742 --> 17:59.146
in the store, and there's a line
of cheap, jittery women outside.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.215
(exhales)
I don't have a baby!

18:02.282 --> 18:04.317
And I don't have a secret!

18:09.756 --> 18:11.224
Oh, hey, Tyler.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.360
You work here,
too, huh?
Oh, yeah.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.995
Between the propane and
the wind and the solar,

18:16.062 --> 18:17.464
who knows how long

18:17.530 --> 18:19.566
natural gas is
gonna be around for.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.535
But Pac-Man, that's forever.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.738
You looking
for your pops.
Yeah.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.207
Photo booth.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.078
Dad, I know
you're in there.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.980
Just come on out.
No!

18:34.046 --> 18:36.649
If he's not gonna come out,
he's got to take some pictures.

18:45.192 --> 18:48.295
I know you're afraid about
going through with this, Dad.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.830
I'm not afraid.
After the pill
that guy gave me,

18:50.897 --> 18:53.666
you could've examined
my prostate, I wouldn't
even have flinched.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.867
He did.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.002
See?

18:56.068 --> 18:58.070
(beeping)

18:58.137 --> 18:59.506
(flashbulb pops, shutter clicks)

18:59.572 --> 19:01.208
Then why did you run?

19:01.274 --> 19:02.775
Because you refused
to pull my finger.

19:02.842 --> 19:06.813
But, Dad, it was
a long, hard day.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.648
I just wasn't in the mood
for goofing around.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.250
I'm worried about us
growing apart.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.818
I know you'll
always be my son,

19:11.884 --> 19:13.953
but I don't know
you'll always be my buddy.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.822
What?

19:15.888 --> 19:19.392
Look... I know I'm
like Mad magazine--

19:19.459 --> 19:22.061
my audience is
a pretty specific age,

19:22.128 --> 19:24.397
probably, like, ten to 17.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.766
You're 22 now--
you got a kid
of your own.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.336
You might be outgrowing
the Burt Show.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.572
Having you was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.308
But if you outgrew me,
I'd like to have the option

19:35.375 --> 19:37.043
to make another little buddy.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.312
(beeping)

19:39.379 --> 19:41.180
(flashbulb pops, shutter clicks)

19:41.248 --> 19:44.984
Wait. Having me was
the best thing that
ever happened to you?

19:45.051 --> 19:46.686
Greatest day of my life.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.222
Well, I always figured
that since I was a mistake,

19:49.289 --> 19:52.292
you guys would rather I turned
out to be a pregnancy scare.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.427
Of course not.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.763
I will always be your buddy.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.231
And I promise

19:58.298 --> 20:01.568
I will never get tired
of the Burt Show.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.272
I'm not a machine, Jimmy.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.106
I need a little time to...

20:07.173 --> 20:08.341
Hold it. Wait.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.410
(beeping)
Okay, now!

20:16.048 --> 20:18.785
JIMMY:
When Dad realized that
he truly had a buddy for life,

20:18.851 --> 20:20.487
he happily went through
with the vasectomy.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.955
Time to switch.
These are still
pretty cold.

20:23.022 --> 20:26.493
Yeah, but Mom needs the peas
for the shepherd's pie.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.829
(chuckles)

20:29.896 --> 20:31.030
Berries.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.665
He wasn't the only one
who learned

20:32.732 --> 20:35.034
that having a buddy
you can trust is a cool thing.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.504
Now that you know about my
summer at sleep away camp,

20:37.570 --> 20:39.372
now you got to tell me
something about you.

20:39.439 --> 20:44.277
Oh. Remember that time
somebody knocked over the
statue at the black church,

20:44.344 --> 20:47.079
everybody thought
it was a hate crime?

20:47.146 --> 20:51.284
That was the day I taught myself
how to drive a stick shift.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.152
(laughing)

20:53.219 --> 20:54.487
I learned something, too.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.623
Even though I was a mistake,

20:56.689 --> 20:59.859
I'm a mistake my parents
would gladly make again.

21:04.030 --> 21:08.901
And that is something you and I
definitely have in common.

21:08.968 --> 21:12.238
I couldn't have planned how you
came to me in a million years.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.773
But I always want
you to know,

21:13.840 --> 21:15.875
you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.911
Which is why I'm going to teach
you a Chance family tradition.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.013
Pull my finger.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.281
Come on.

21:22.349 --> 21:24.016
Pull it.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.752
Here.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.920
Like this.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.722
(quiet flatulence)

21:29.789 --> 21:32.392
(laughing)

21:35.061 --> 21:37.029
CHILD: Bi... ble. The end.
