WEBVTT

00:10.632 --> 00:11.609
You're late!

00:11.633 --> 00:12.633
No, I'm not.

00:13.626 --> 00:16.613
Most civilized people eat
breakfast at 7:00 a. m.

00:21.982 --> 00:24.007
I got you wheat toast and a salad.

00:24.742 --> 00:27.016
It's doctor's orders until
you get your cholesterol down.

00:27.040 --> 00:30.160
And Vanity Fair called again; They want
to know where the photos are for the...

00:45.079 --> 00:46.727
These are really...

00:51.562 --> 00:53.142
"Really" what?

00:53.769 --> 00:54.830
Boring?

00:55.279 --> 00:56.455
Stupid?

00:57.434 --> 00:58.548
What's wrong?

00:59.675 --> 01:01.606
There's a man in this photo and...

01:03.719 --> 01:04.783
he's dead.

01:56.983 --> 02:01.412
I didn't know that fixing a leak
involved tearing out half the wall.

02:01.910 --> 02:02.940
I found it.

02:03.095 --> 02:04.890
Nice work.

02:05.868 --> 02:07.780
- Ready for payment?
- Not done.

02:07.804 --> 02:09.637
What do you mean you're not done?

02:09.681 --> 02:12.611
The sleeve is only
temporary; Pipes are old.

02:12.937 --> 02:14.430
The leak's going to spread.

02:15.787 --> 02:19.138
You've got to swap out all
these old iron pipes with copper.

02:19.970 --> 02:21.000
All of them.

02:22.047 --> 02:23.301
You know a good plumber?

02:24.485 --> 02:26.065
I know a great plumber.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.332
You ready for that jump payment?

02:31.598 --> 02:33.451
Hang on. Yeah, Gibbs.

02:33.475 --> 02:36.026
Gibbs, a call came in
about a dead sailor.

02:36.050 --> 02:37.897
Have them meet me there.

02:37.921 --> 02:38.967
Go.

02:40.049 --> 02:42.332
I'll be here when you get back.

02:42.782 --> 02:44.085
A blind photographer?

02:44.109 --> 02:45.575
Well, apparently he's quite successful.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.133
Why not? Beethoven was deaf.

02:48.734 --> 02:51.756
After my assistant noticed
the body, I blew up the photo.

02:51.911 --> 02:54.226
She saw the uniform, called you.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.599
I'll need a copy of
your negative, Mr. Scott.

02:56.835 --> 02:58.328
Sorry we're late, boss.

02:58.352 --> 03:02.386
Hit every red light and
we had to stop and get gas.

03:02.661 --> 03:04.223
And some...

03:04.429 --> 03:05.528
bratwurst?

03:09.165 --> 03:11.845
Everybody gets hungry.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.329
Where's the body?

03:13.353 --> 03:16.353
Apparently there's been some
sort of miscommunication.

03:17.042 --> 03:20.670
What? We carried all our
equipment up here for nothing.

03:21.030 --> 03:22.077
Yeah "we".

03:23.056 --> 03:25.299
Do you remember where you
were when you took that photo?

03:25.323 --> 03:28.876
I was at the corner of 18th
and Wescott following the fruit.

03:29.305 --> 03:33.017
Since Mr. Scott lost his eyesight in
an automobile accident ten years ago,

03:33.041 --> 03:36.162
he's had to rely on his
other senses for his work.

03:36.196 --> 03:40.159
Instead of following the light,
he'll go out and follow a sound

03:40.183 --> 03:43.255
or in this case, a scent as inspiration.

03:43.615 --> 03:46.446
Last night, it was some
kind of... fruit smell.

03:46.944 --> 03:48.420
Slightly rotted.

03:48.695 --> 03:50.688
Like an orange, maybe.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.385
Bad cologne, I followed
it for over an hour.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.317
'Til I hit that underpass...

03:55.886 --> 03:58.552
and then all I could smell was vomit.

03:59.995 --> 04:02.057
What's the inspiration behind these?

04:02.834 --> 04:04.636
Oh... I heard

04:05.065 --> 04:07.988
a girl crying, I followed the tears.

04:08.366 --> 04:10.048
I don't see a girl.

04:10.426 --> 04:11.868
Neither did I.

04:14.487 --> 04:18.151
It's funny how a hundred people
probably walked by this guy

04:18.175 --> 04:20.175
and it took a blind man to find him.

04:20.298 --> 04:21.495
"It's funny"?

04:21.519 --> 04:24.121
Well, funny in a kind
of sad, pathetic way.

04:24.145 --> 04:25.500
What if I was blind?

04:28.005 --> 04:31.405
That technique may work for the
likes of Jackson Scott, Tony,

04:31.429 --> 04:35.716
but a true investigator keeps
his eyes open at all times.

04:35.922 --> 04:40.179
A lesson this unfortunate
would have done well to heed.

04:40.385 --> 04:41.584
Does he have a name?

04:41.608 --> 04:43.516
No wallet, no I.D.

04:43.540 --> 04:44.740
Found this, Duck.

04:45.882 --> 04:48.444
Sharp-force trauma to the abdomen,

04:48.468 --> 04:51.369
making that the probable murder weapon.

04:51.730 --> 04:53.452
If this was a murder, of course.

04:54.643 --> 04:57.881
Yeah, I know, I know.
It always is, isn't it?

04:58.208 --> 05:00.373
I can't imagine what I'd
do if I lost my eyesight.

05:00.397 --> 05:01.850
You'd adapt.

05:02.348 --> 05:03.464
What if I didn't?

05:03.704 --> 05:06.540
You'd fall into a deep depression
and eventually you would die.

05:07.502 --> 05:10.867
Remind me not to come to you
for a pep talking anytime soon.

05:14.319 --> 05:15.342
What?

05:15.366 --> 05:16.510
Fresh vomit.

05:16.836 --> 05:19.414
Whoever it belongs to
must have seen something.

05:20.246 --> 05:23.903
Time of death roughly 15 hours ago.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.101
Those markings on his neck?

05:27.125 --> 05:29.270
Yeah, well abrasions such as those

05:29.294 --> 05:32.200
usually result from the
forcible removal of jewelry.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.300
Perhaps a crucifix or in
his case, his dog tags.

05:35.324 --> 05:36.362
Pre-mortem?

05:36.386 --> 05:39.380
Well, the inflammation
suggests he was still alive.

05:39.404 --> 05:41.175
Combine that with the missing wallet...

05:41.199 --> 05:42.930
Looks like a mugging.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.695
I'll just swab under the fingernails.

05:45.815 --> 05:47.703
He is right, actually.

05:47.755 --> 05:51.512
Snatched necklace, missing wallet,
signs of struggle, textbook mugging.

05:51.536 --> 05:53.220
Or it was made to look like one.

05:54.014 --> 05:56.802
Although photography didn't
come came into its own

05:56.826 --> 05:59.234
as an art form until the 20th century,

05:59.595 --> 06:05.161
it was during the Civil War that
its more infamous side blossomed.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.583
Oh, I know this...

06:07.098 --> 06:11.047
Mathew Brady, the famous
battlefield photographer.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.557
I said infamous, Mr. Palmer.

06:13.866 --> 06:17.070
It wasn't pictures of
battlefields the soldiers wanted,

06:17.094 --> 06:19.618
but subjects of a bluer nature.

06:19.927 --> 06:22.519
I thought color film
wasn't invented until...

06:23.398 --> 06:24.384
Oh, you mean...

06:24.408 --> 06:27.784
As with all new media, carnal activity

06:27.808 --> 06:31.863
came to the forefront, thus
proving the old adage...

06:31.887 --> 06:33.226
Sex sells.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.097
Yes, it does.

06:35.286 --> 06:38.473
Although I assume that's not what
you came down here to discuss.

06:38.497 --> 06:40.811
- That's a good guess.
- Yeah, well, how about another one?

06:40.835 --> 06:43.915
You came down here hoping
that I had found some

06:43.939 --> 06:46.433
subtle incongruity in my autopsy

06:46.457 --> 06:50.020
that would shed some light
on this dastardly mystery.

06:50.044 --> 06:52.038
Always seems to be the case, Duck.

06:52.062 --> 06:53.920
Yes, well, all I've done so far is

06:53.944 --> 06:56.940
to confirm my initial impression
as to the cause of death.

06:56.964 --> 06:58.041
He was stabbed.

06:58.065 --> 06:59.423
Right in the stomach.

06:59.447 --> 07:04.611
Now, even with medical intervention,
this lad was not long for this world.

07:04.635 --> 07:06.868
You mean Petty Officer Peter Lynn.

07:06.892 --> 07:09.879
Worked in the Supply Corps at
the Defense Logistics Agency,

07:09.903 --> 07:14.955
which is also know as DLA,
if you're ever in the K-N-O-W.

07:16.020 --> 07:20.495
They're the guys who supply the military,
you know, with pretty much everything.

07:20.519 --> 07:21.800
You already knew this.

07:21.824 --> 07:25.668
He was a liaison to the Naval Space
Command, which is the spy satellite guys.

07:25.692 --> 07:27.608
You remember the time we had
the naked girl on the beach...

07:27.632 --> 07:30.258
you already know about all this.

07:31.872 --> 07:33.490
Abby got a hit off the prints.

07:33.514 --> 07:35.155
That's not all Abby got.

07:35.179 --> 07:37.727
She was able to match
mitochondrial fragments

07:37.751 --> 07:41.950
in the vomit to the cellular material
scraped from the victim's fingernails.

07:41.974 --> 07:43.616
They both came from the assailant.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.099
The old snatch and vomit?

07:45.123 --> 07:49.134
Emesis, as it is known, is not
uncommon in first-time offenders.

07:49.375 --> 07:53.062
They learn the hard way that they don't
have the stomach for a life of crime.

07:53.086 --> 07:55.477
Take our mugger's last supper:

07:55.501 --> 07:58.538
A cheese blintz, some red wine...

07:58.562 --> 08:00.601
no doubt a cheap bordeaux...

08:00.790 --> 08:03.075
and almost a pound of veal.

08:03.099 --> 08:05.100
Mugging business must be good, Duck.

08:05.124 --> 08:07.783
I'll have Ziva start running
down the local restaurants.

08:07.807 --> 08:10.498
Uh, I got an address on
Petty Officer Lynn, as well.

08:11.907 --> 08:13.748
So, where were we?

08:13.985 --> 08:14.997
Pornography.

08:15.249 --> 08:18.537
Yes, I believe it was
photography, Mr. Palmer.

08:18.561 --> 08:22.443
Kindly try to keep your
mind out of the gutter.

08:26.418 --> 08:27.414
What is it?

08:27.438 --> 08:32.770
Perhaps I have found a
subtle incongruity after all.

08:33.284 --> 08:34.530
Thank you.

08:35.822 --> 08:38.294
You take over here.

08:38.672 --> 08:43.111
I need to consult with Ms. Sciuto.

08:52.522 --> 08:53.752
Hello?

08:57.244 --> 08:58.943
Where did that come from?

08:59.255 --> 09:01.515
I haven't the foggiest idea.

09:01.539 --> 09:05.100
Really? How incongruous.

09:05.855 --> 09:08.465
Please dispose of this, Mr. Palmer.

09:21.726 --> 09:25.194
Hi. Yeah, well, I found the bra.

09:25.675 --> 09:27.615
It was a close call, but, uh...

09:28.375 --> 09:30.538
Oh, no, no. No panties, we just...

09:31.585 --> 09:33.404
What do you mean a matching set?

09:33.903 --> 09:36.912
Petty Officer Lynn live alone?
We'll find out soon enough.

09:48.646 --> 09:50.517
Hmm, the Eagle Nebula.

09:50.946 --> 09:51.976
Trash.

09:52.285 --> 09:53.906
What are you talking about "trash"?

09:53.930 --> 09:56.771
This is known as the
Pillars of Creation, Tony.

09:59.072 --> 10:00.291
Talking about this.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.467
He must really not like
taking the trash out.

10:03.999 --> 10:05.596
Maybe it's not trash.

10:12.036 --> 10:13.285
Yeah, what do you got, Duck?

10:13.309 --> 10:14.782
An interesting development, Jethro.

10:14.806 --> 10:16.639
When I opened Petty
Officer Lynn's stomach,

10:16.663 --> 10:18.498
I discovered that he, too,

10:18.522 --> 10:21.312
before his mugging had
eaten a cheese blintz.

10:21.535 --> 10:22.600
Popular dish.

10:22.943 --> 10:24.244
Coincidence? No.

10:24.268 --> 10:26.680
I found traces of the
same wine in both stomachs.

10:26.704 --> 10:30.025
The D-glucose levels in the
tannin, it's like a fingerprint.

10:30.049 --> 10:32.506
They shared a meal,
Jethro, which means...

10:33.021 --> 10:35.149
It wasn't a random mugging.

10:46.581 --> 10:49.327
Never thought I'd be
doing this again so soon.

10:49.939 --> 10:51.717
When was the last time?

10:51.741 --> 10:55.539
After my Psych Evaluation Profile.
I wanted to read the rough drafts.

10:56.174 --> 10:58.199
- What'd they say?
- I have no idea.

10:58.223 --> 11:01.065
The papers I reconstructed...
they weren't mine.

11:01.089 --> 11:02.805
They're yours.

11:03.543 --> 11:04.591
Mine?

11:05.375 --> 11:07.599
You read my psych
profile? What'd it say?

11:07.623 --> 11:09.446
Ah, it's better you don't know, McGee.

11:09.470 --> 11:10.955
Got your message. What do you got, Abs?

11:10.979 --> 11:14.323
Trash, and lots of it. Sadly,
nothing that can identify the owner.

11:14.347 --> 11:15.645
Yet.

11:15.669 --> 11:17.058
No thanks.

11:18.448 --> 11:19.437
I quit.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.051
Quit? You?

11:21.075 --> 11:24.025
I decided it was time to
cut down on the caffeine.

11:24.049 --> 11:27.517
I wish I could tell I've already
reconstructed these documents.

11:27.551 --> 11:30.585
I've got it run on an automated program,
but it's still going to take some time.

11:30.609 --> 11:32.415
You called me down here
to tell me you got nothing?

11:32.439 --> 11:34.664
Me, nothing.

11:35.009 --> 11:39.312
But Mister Mildly Neurotic Introvert
with a highly sensitive ego...

11:39.593 --> 11:41.001
he has something.

11:41.688 --> 11:42.783
Yeah. Um,

11:42.807 --> 11:44.941
I was going through Petty
Officer Lynn's computer,

11:44.965 --> 11:47.653
looking for an address
book, and I found this.

11:47.677 --> 11:49.219
It's called Celestia.

11:49.243 --> 11:52.058
It's an open-source
astronomy program popular

11:52.082 --> 11:54.364
with space enthusiasts,
people in the field.

11:54.828 --> 11:56.433
I'm not one of them, McGee.

11:56.742 --> 11:59.637
Sorry. My point is, it's supposed
to be an accurate simulation,

11:59.661 --> 12:01.926
but I found a star system
that doesn't belong.

12:01.950 --> 12:03.231
Of course you did.

12:04.896 --> 12:06.302
Program's open source.

12:06.326 --> 12:10.148
That means you can adapt it to pretty
much anything... education, games.

12:10.172 --> 12:12.894
You can store grocery
lists, or in this case,

12:12.918 --> 12:14.969
- use it for a diary.
- What better place

12:14.993 --> 12:19.567
to hide all your personal secrets
than in a galaxy far far away?

12:19.591 --> 12:21.135
What's he hiding?

12:21.311 --> 12:23.166
Well, for the most
part, not a whole lot.

12:23.190 --> 12:25.606
It's about the most boring
diary I've ever read.

12:25.630 --> 12:29.034
An obsession with Kelly Clarkson.
Wondering why he can't find a girlfriend.

12:29.058 --> 12:31.762
He didn't make the connection
between those two things?

12:31.786 --> 12:33.890
Two weeks ago, though,
it got interesting.

12:33.914 --> 12:35.953
Lynn claims that he
was contacted by someone

12:35.977 --> 12:38.447
at the Naval Inspector
General's office in Norfolk.

12:38.471 --> 12:39.699
Asked to go on a mission.

12:39.723 --> 12:41.416
- He say who?
- Nope.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.319
Didn't say what kind, either.
That was the last entry.

12:52.368 --> 12:55.291
You were kidding about the
delicate ego thing, right?

12:55.905 --> 12:58.154
A question that answers itself.

13:08.679 --> 13:11.213
My name is Special
Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

13:11.237 --> 13:13.851
This is my partner, Ziva David.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.458
Commander Doug Jakobsen.

13:24.253 --> 13:29.203
So, what can the Inspector General's
Office do for our investigative cousins?

13:29.227 --> 13:32.381
Are you familiar with a Petty
Officer by the name of Peter Lynn?

13:33.527 --> 13:34.969
Excuse me.

13:36.446 --> 13:39.083
Yes, I'm familiar with the name.

13:39.107 --> 13:42.077
Was he helping with an
investigation out of this office?

13:43.532 --> 13:45.420
Petty Officer Lynn...

13:47.525 --> 13:49.612
isn't helping with an investigation.

13:50.341 --> 13:51.491
He's the subject of it.

13:51.515 --> 13:53.448
- There's nothing on his record.
- There wouldn't be.

13:53.472 --> 13:55.051
The investigation is classified.

13:56.115 --> 13:57.753
But you guys saved me a call.

13:57.777 --> 14:01.218
I was just about to
bring NCIS in on this.

14:04.067 --> 14:08.861
We believe P.O. Lynn is abusing
his position as a DLA Storekeeper.

14:09.239 --> 14:13.591
Providing info on military
purchases to competing vendors.

14:13.615 --> 14:14.995
Not anymore.

14:16.191 --> 14:18.131
Petty Officer Lynn's dead.

14:19.521 --> 14:21.855
- How?
- Stabbed to death.

14:22.079 --> 14:24.259
Someone tried to make
it look like a mugging.

14:26.629 --> 14:27.850
Suspects?

14:27.874 --> 14:30.392
An accomplice, perhaps.

14:31.147 --> 14:32.857
We thought he was working alone.

14:32.881 --> 14:35.779
Maybe his buyers are
covering their tracks.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.037
Good luck sniffing them out.

14:40.312 --> 14:45.042
Now that there's been a murder,
NCIS gets sole jurisdiction,

14:45.197 --> 14:48.792
but if there's anything
I can do, let me know.

14:51.865 --> 14:53.152
Something wrong?

14:55.625 --> 14:58.097
No... her than a dead petty officer.

14:58.335 --> 15:00.125
He betrayed his country.

15:00.314 --> 15:02.872
Far as I'm concerned, he
got what was coming to him.

15:03.198 --> 15:05.001
Oh, come on already!

15:05.429 --> 15:06.569
Please stay on the line.

15:06.593 --> 15:09.218
Your call will be answered in the
order in which it was received.

15:10.391 --> 15:12.549
I got your message. Yeah.

15:12.573 --> 15:13.768
Why didn't you answer your phone?

15:13.792 --> 15:16.091
I've been on hold with the
Department of Development.

15:16.812 --> 15:17.840
What about your cell?

15:17.864 --> 15:20.760
On hold with the Secretary
of the Commonwealth's office.

15:20.828 --> 15:21.967
And...

15:21.991 --> 15:23.516
they disconnected me again.

15:23.540 --> 15:24.993
Jeanne, what's going on?

15:25.017 --> 15:27.367
I'm being evicted. My
building is going condo.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.073
Condo?

15:30.097 --> 15:31.716
Is there something funny about that?

15:31.740 --> 15:33.965
No, I just... I got
your message, and so I...

15:34.274 --> 15:35.318
Never mind.

15:35.545 --> 15:37.337
- What can I do?
- You're doing it.

15:37.361 --> 15:38.782
Thank you for coming.

15:41.175 --> 15:43.212
It's no problem, because

15:43.236 --> 15:46.354
I said I had a dentist's
appointment. Again.

15:47.164 --> 15:50.532
I've got 30 days to find a new place,
but no time to go apartment hunting.

15:50.556 --> 15:53.531
One of my colleagues offered me
their couch if I can't find anything.

15:53.555 --> 15:55.718
No. I've seen Grey's
Anatomy. That's out.

15:55.742 --> 15:57.634
My mother offered me a bed.

15:59.975 --> 16:02.235
So, I either fight it, or...

16:02.259 --> 16:04.071
We get a place together.

16:05.893 --> 16:07.198
Tony.

16:16.533 --> 16:17.545
Yeah.

16:19.365 --> 16:21.554
Department of Housing and Development.

16:21.578 --> 16:22.993
How may we direct your call?

16:23.017 --> 16:24.441
Nowhere.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.739
I'm moving in with my boyfriend.

16:35.438 --> 16:38.097
The fifth photo was a... Streetlight.

16:38.286 --> 16:40.260
Oh, yeah, right, right, right.

16:40.483 --> 16:41.960
Halogen one.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.723
Let me see, uh...

16:45.747 --> 16:49.541
Oh, yeah, yeah, there was a,
couple having a fight nearby.

16:49.565 --> 16:51.830
A hot dog vendor.

16:51.881 --> 16:55.495
And something that
smelled like mothballs.

16:55.519 --> 16:57.393
- I didn't get too close.
- The next one is...

16:57.417 --> 16:59.402
I'm not used to working with anyone.

16:59.426 --> 17:02.022
Bad news from the dentist?

17:02.794 --> 17:04.760
Something like that.

17:04.784 --> 17:07.507
Okay, um, this is number six?

17:07.531 --> 17:10.306
That's where Mr. Scott first
picked up the fruit smell.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.493
You with him?

17:11.518 --> 17:14.103
No. I was in the office when he left.

17:14.127 --> 17:17.182
I work alone, and I like it that way.

17:17.542 --> 17:21.234
Bryn writes our press releases, so I had to
go over the photos with her this morning.

17:21.259 --> 17:26.357
Like I said, it was an unusual
scent, so I followed it.

17:26.615 --> 17:28.325
Why aren't we using the plasma?

17:28.348 --> 17:31.516
He said he didn't like looking
at his pictures on a computer.

17:31.540 --> 17:33.084
He's blind.

17:36.349 --> 17:38.352
Okay, this is seven.

17:38.376 --> 17:41.311
Looks like a... it could be a sewer.

17:42.032 --> 17:43.858
And I'm the blind one.

17:44.016 --> 17:45.584
You got the pictures
out of order, honey.

17:45.608 --> 17:48.719
Number seven's a sky shot...
number 22 is the low-angle.

17:49.180 --> 17:50.210
Good memory.

17:50.234 --> 17:52.242
Yeah, well, I don't have much choice.

17:52.266 --> 17:54.610
Either that, or I break
my nose walking into walls.

17:54.634 --> 17:57.742
Number 22 is where Mr.
Scott lost the fruit smell.

17:57.982 --> 17:59.572
I recognize that graffiti.

17:59.596 --> 18:01.323
It's on the restaurant

18:01.347 --> 18:04.030
where I tracked Petty Officer
Lynn to his last supper.

18:04.054 --> 18:05.265
You found the restaurant?

18:05.289 --> 18:08.513
Well, there's not too many
places that serve cheese blintzes.

18:08.537 --> 18:10.673
But no one remembers
seeing the petty officer.

18:10.697 --> 18:12.903
If he was the source of the
smell he never came out of there.

18:12.927 --> 18:15.597
And if he wasn't, then he was
probably with the guy who was.

18:15.621 --> 18:17.075
They could have used the back exit.

18:17.099 --> 18:19.205
Which would make sense if
they were having a clandestine

18:19.229 --> 18:21.851
meeting and were worried
about being followed.

18:22.138 --> 18:25.451
Check, uh... number 18.

18:26.121 --> 18:29.341
There was a car idling
outside the restaurant.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.931
- Sorry.
- I'll get those.

18:34.955 --> 18:36.666
Time to go digital.

18:36.690 --> 18:37.978
How long was he there?

18:38.007 --> 18:40.296
Well, he was still there when I left.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.125
Can you get the license?

18:51.740 --> 18:53.817
Accessing the Virginia DMV.

18:54.693 --> 18:56.610
We only have a partial plate,
but we can narrow it down

18:56.634 --> 18:58.491
- by making model.
- Really?

18:58.834 --> 19:00.492
Sarcasm is not sexy, Ziva.

19:00.516 --> 19:02.939
Narrowing the list
down to make and model.

19:02.963 --> 19:07.952
Got it. License plate T-A
five, four, zero, two, one.

19:07.976 --> 19:11.538
Registered to a David
Wong, 41, civilian.

19:11.766 --> 19:12.934
Record?

19:14.603 --> 19:16.330
Guy's squeaky clean...
no criminal record,

19:16.354 --> 19:18.425
no outstanding parking tickets.

19:18.786 --> 19:22.720
Works in Inventory Management
at the Defense Logistics Agency.

19:22.744 --> 19:25.208
Who else works there, he thought sexily?

19:25.232 --> 19:27.388
I know a petty officer who used to.

19:27.412 --> 19:29.636
And just as squeaky.

19:29.660 --> 19:32.202
Call McGee and have him
bring David Wong in here.

19:34.917 --> 19:37.017
I was just about to call you, Tony.

19:37.041 --> 19:39.927
I was going to say great minds
think alike, but, well, you know.

19:39.951 --> 19:42.635
- Got a lead.
- Yeah, we do, too. We found a car

19:42.659 --> 19:46.309
outside the restaurant Petty Officer
Lynn ate at. A Honda licence plate...

19:46.333 --> 19:48.214
T A, five, four, zero, two, one?

19:48.238 --> 19:49.884
- Good guess.
- Not a guess.

19:49.908 --> 19:51.925
I'm standing right in front of it.

19:52.285 --> 19:54.929
I spoke to Petty
Officer Lynn's superiors.

19:55.273 --> 19:57.132
They had a lot of nice
things to say about him.

19:57.156 --> 19:59.913
It's the guy in the office across
the hall they were worried about.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.633
- David Wong.
- That's right.

20:01.657 --> 20:02.981
Why were they worried?

20:03.015 --> 20:06.044
He left for lunch four
hours ago, never came back.

20:18.030 --> 20:19.930
A blind photographer.

20:19.954 --> 20:21.664
That is a new one.

20:22.297 --> 20:23.344
Is he a suspect?

20:23.587 --> 20:24.587
Not yet.

20:26.104 --> 20:27.958
Uh... got to come straight in.

20:29.632 --> 20:31.778
So, he takes a picture of a dead body,

20:32.035 --> 20:34.072
who just happens to be

20:34.096 --> 20:37.976
under investigation for the
Inspector General's office?

20:38.405 --> 20:40.465
Thought you didn't like coincidences.

20:40.671 --> 20:42.363
Well, that's why I said not yet.

20:43.607 --> 20:45.066
You got any suspects?

20:45.221 --> 20:48.815
A co-worker of Petty Officer
Lynn's went MIA today.

20:49.501 --> 20:50.651
Left in a hurry.

20:51.440 --> 20:54.885
I'd offer to help you with your manhunt,

20:54.909 --> 20:58.894
but I filed for retirement today.

21:00.868 --> 21:03.821
Plus, I got my own
manhunt to worry about.

21:10.022 --> 21:12.082
This is the part where
you say something.

21:12.975 --> 21:14.520
I'm not sure which part to start with.

21:15.155 --> 21:16.899
You could start with how you feel.

21:16.923 --> 21:18.321
- How do you feel?
- Good.

21:18.664 --> 21:21.703
I'm ready for something permanent.
And the Army's not going to,

21:22.081 --> 21:23.782
you know, give that to me but...

21:26.182 --> 21:28.168
That's a nice try, but,

21:28.192 --> 21:30.668
this is the part where
you say something,

21:30.692 --> 21:31.916
remember?

21:31.940 --> 21:34.871
I guess I'm wondering what
you mean by "permanent."

21:38.599 --> 21:42.307
I mean that... I like you.

21:42.906 --> 21:43.970
And...

21:44.485 --> 21:46.356
I think you like me, too.

21:51.088 --> 21:53.491
You're going to have
to confirm or deny that.

21:54.384 --> 21:55.586
I like you.

21:58.163 --> 21:59.227
Good.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.913
Well, as you know,

22:02.937 --> 22:05.652
when two people like each other,

22:06.133 --> 22:09.241
they usually like to
spend time with each other.

22:09.265 --> 22:11.042
And I consider my time valuable,

22:11.080 --> 22:14.811
thus I consider time spent
with you an investment.

22:15.829 --> 22:18.510
That makes me like... what?

22:18.716 --> 22:19.740
A CD?

22:21.491 --> 22:23.586
At our age, more like an IRA.

22:24.187 --> 22:26.710
And I've, I've already,

22:27.174 --> 22:29.047
uh, invested a lot in it.

22:30.043 --> 22:32.366
You never know how things
are going to turn out,

22:32.390 --> 22:35.816
and I'm not asking for
promises. I just need to know

22:36.417 --> 22:38.460
if you're in this for the long haul.

22:41.943 --> 22:45.464
I want to start building something,
and I want to build it with you.

22:59.641 --> 23:00.807
Holly, I do like you.

23:04.767 --> 23:06.443
I'm just...

23:07.250 --> 23:08.761
What? Wounded?

23:09.705 --> 23:11.556
- Afraid to love?
- I'm in the middle of a case,

23:11.580 --> 23:14.363
and I'm not real focused right now.

23:19.333 --> 23:21.966
Okay, well, I didn't expect
to get an answer tonight,

23:21.990 --> 23:24.669
but I did have to ask the question.

23:25.527 --> 23:28.399
I'm leaving for Fort Bragg.

23:29.275 --> 23:31.506
I'm helping choose my
replacement tomorrow.

23:32.107 --> 23:36.044
You know, and hopefully when I get
back you may have an answer for me.

23:37.486 --> 23:40.261
I'd hate to have to find a new plumber.

23:48.257 --> 23:49.618
No hits on the BOLO yet.

23:50.013 --> 23:52.045
Co-workers said he'd been
acting strange all week.

23:52.069 --> 23:55.049
If he planned his run, it'll
make him that much harder to find.

23:55.073 --> 23:56.778
Did you track his cell calls yet?

23:56.802 --> 23:59.421
Agent Lee is getting the warrant now.
She's at the U.S. Attorney's office.

23:59.445 --> 24:01.550
And Abby's processing
evidence from his office.

24:01.574 --> 24:04.073
She nearly bit my head off
when I poked it in to her lab

24:04.097 --> 24:05.980
- to check on her.
- Quit drinking caffeine.

24:06.004 --> 24:07.134
Abby?

24:07.498 --> 24:09.266
Abby Sciuto?

24:10.004 --> 24:12.814
- Yes, boss?
- Wong, David Wong.

24:13.277 --> 24:15.433
We have two competing
theories on Mr. Wong.

24:15.457 --> 24:17.968
- Theory one...
- It is possible that David Wong

24:17.992 --> 24:19.979
and Petty Officer Lynn
were working together.

24:20.003 --> 24:22.657
And then they had a fall out and
Wong ended their relationship.

24:22.681 --> 24:23.962
Theory two.

24:23.986 --> 24:27.358
The Commander from the I.G. had
it wrong about Petty Officer Lynn.

24:27.382 --> 24:30.585
Wong was selling the info, Lynn
found out, Wong killed him for it.

24:30.609 --> 24:33.174
We figure out a motive, we'll
figure out where he's going.

24:33.198 --> 24:35.217
First, we need that warrant.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.632
I've got it right here.

24:37.692 --> 24:41.022
Uh, Agent Lee faxed this over.
I thought I'd run it up to you.

24:42.069 --> 24:44.011
- McGee.
- Yeah? On it, boss.

24:47.427 --> 24:49.337
All right, pulling up his records.

24:57.526 --> 24:58.848
You need something else?

24:59.449 --> 25:00.462
Uh... no.

25:06.353 --> 25:08.206
Palmer's been acting
like that all morning.

25:08.230 --> 25:11.446
Earlier, I caught him at the
gym hiding in the towel bins.

25:11.482 --> 25:13.094
Bank records are coming up.

25:14.107 --> 25:15.635
No unusual activity.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.606
You know what? I got to make a pit stop.

25:26.528 --> 25:29.074
I can't think of anything
charming or pithy to say.

25:29.121 --> 25:31.723
Well... I have fantastic news.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.583
I think I found us a place.

25:34.666 --> 25:35.948
That's great.

25:35.995 --> 25:39.142
It's a three bedroom apartment,
not far from the university

25:39.166 --> 25:42.604
or the hospital and has
really cute floral wallpaper.

25:46.233 --> 25:48.345
That, that, that's great.

25:48.396 --> 25:50.844
Great as in... "great" or...

25:51.015 --> 25:53.034
"great" as in you're
having second thoughts?

25:53.058 --> 25:54.623
I'm not having second thoughts.

25:56.988 --> 25:58.447
Is there a third option?

26:01.022 --> 26:02.458
Don't do this to me, Tony.

26:02.482 --> 26:03.590
Jeanne...

26:03.838 --> 26:07.201
You didn't have to say anything yesterday.
You could have just given me a hug

26:07.225 --> 26:10.718
and told me everything would be okay.
That would have been more than enough.

26:10.742 --> 26:14.232
But don't tell me you want to
live with me, then take it back.

26:14.256 --> 26:15.709
I am not taking it back.

26:15.733 --> 26:20.570
When I suggested that we live
together, I was speaking from...

26:21.463 --> 26:24.450
you know... what's that,
the thing in you rib cage?

26:25.402 --> 26:26.421
Heart.

26:26.850 --> 26:28.859
Heart. Yeah.

26:29.700 --> 26:32.068
I was... and I am.

26:33.219 --> 26:34.243
And I meant it.

26:34.267 --> 26:35.256
I'm just...

26:35.280 --> 26:37.207
A commitmentphobe afraid to love.

26:37.344 --> 26:38.683
Right in the middle there.

26:40.511 --> 26:43.683
And I'm... I'm just not
very focused right now.

26:44.425 --> 26:45.911
And I'm not a big fan of floral.

26:45.935 --> 26:47.657
I'll be honest with you.

26:48.618 --> 26:50.043
Okay, then...

26:50.764 --> 26:52.492
I'll keep looking, if

26:52.516 --> 26:54.975
you're sure that's all that it is?

26:55.644 --> 26:57.258
Yeah. I'm sure.

26:57.807 --> 27:00.127
Then what are you doing on
the phone? Get back to work.

27:00.151 --> 27:01.611
Yes, ma'am.

27:07.747 --> 27:09.344
- Hi.
- Hey.

27:09.481 --> 27:11.190
Abby called; She found something.

27:11.214 --> 27:12.410
Wanted us to come down.

27:12.434 --> 27:15.376
- If you're done, that is.
- I'm sorry, boss, I... I'm...

27:15.400 --> 27:16.498
I know.

27:17.099 --> 27:19.056
DiNozzo, trust me.

27:19.992 --> 27:21.365
I know.

27:25.725 --> 27:27.401
How long were you guys there?

27:27.425 --> 27:28.455
Long enough.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.408
So you are getting a new roommate?

27:34.034 --> 27:35.408
We're discussing it.

27:35.631 --> 27:37.073
What is there to discuss?

27:37.313 --> 27:38.388
It's complicated.

27:38.412 --> 27:40.448
Complicated, complicated, complicated.

27:41.224 --> 27:45.066
You know, in America, I have
noticed they use that word as a code

27:45.090 --> 27:47.990
for... "If I explain
it, you would not agree,

27:48.014 --> 27:52.189
"therefore I will use he word complicated
and hopefully, you will stop asking ".

27:52.299 --> 27:55.253
Yeah, that's pretty much it in a
nutshell. I'm gonna go see what Abby wants.

27:55.277 --> 27:56.838
- Tony...
- Ziva.

27:58.706 --> 28:01.263
If you're going to give
me advice on dating,

28:01.779 --> 28:04.519
I'm going to need to get something
out of my system first, okay?

28:11.839 --> 28:13.931
Stop laughing or I will hurt you.

28:15.204 --> 28:18.132
I know what you're doing. You're
hiding behind all these jokes.

28:18.156 --> 28:20.096
And I know what you're hiding from.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.823
Really? What's that?

28:21.847 --> 28:24.738
Everyone who is afraid
to love hides from

28:25.305 --> 28:26.403
getting hurt.

28:29.064 --> 28:30.558
It's not just me

28:30.970 --> 28:33.425
that I'm worrying about hurting, Ziva.

28:35.151 --> 28:37.378
That's because you're a good person.

28:47.501 --> 28:50.911
It's a low-frequency,
acoustic RF buffer transmitter.

28:50.935 --> 28:53.372
- English, Abs.
- It's a bug.

28:53.647 --> 28:58.193
I found it embedded underneath the
"Caps Lock" key of David Wong's keyboard.

28:58.743 --> 29:01.435
I thought the DLA ran
routine security sweeps.

29:01.459 --> 29:02.969
How did they miss it?

29:03.123 --> 29:05.212
The same way I almost did.

29:05.236 --> 29:06.316
Okay.

29:08.016 --> 29:12.370
To avoid detection from internal
sensors, the bug records for five hours...

29:16.527 --> 29:18.701
and then blast sends the
data in under five seconds.

29:18.725 --> 29:20.345
- A little bug can do all that?
- Yeah.

29:20.369 --> 29:24.051
It can if it only records a few,
tiny sub-audible frequencies.

29:24.075 --> 29:25.614
"Sub-audible" meaning?

29:25.638 --> 29:28.014
- Humans can't hear it.
- So, what?

29:28.038 --> 29:30.994
- Lassie's bugging this guy?
- I think,

29:31.018 --> 29:32.383
he bugged himself.

29:32.496 --> 29:35.080
Don't you like the way I do that?
Like, right when you think you know

29:35.104 --> 29:37.856
where I'm going, it's
like... shazam... a hard turn.

29:37.880 --> 29:39.467
He bugged himself?

29:39.759 --> 29:41.202
- Abs!
- Sorry, Gibbs.

29:41.226 --> 29:43.204
I'm just a little bit distracted.

29:46.863 --> 29:49.122
Better. Sub-audible bug!

29:49.146 --> 29:51.223
Whoever planted it wasn't
eavesdropping on conversations.

29:51.247 --> 29:53.832
They were listening for keyboard taps.

29:53.856 --> 29:56.000
Every key makes a
similar but unique sound.

29:56.024 --> 29:59.327
With the right software, you
can record the keystrokes...

29:59.825 --> 30:02.502
then using a decoding algorithm,
you can figure out what was typed.

30:02.526 --> 30:04.750
The virtual Rosetta Stone.

30:05.729 --> 30:08.559
A bug like this would bypass
all security protocols.

30:08.583 --> 30:10.282
No password would be safe.

30:10.630 --> 30:13.473
David Wong had access to
some pretty sensitive info.

30:13.497 --> 30:15.584
Why would he need to bug himself?

30:15.608 --> 30:17.359
He already knew his passwords.

30:17.857 --> 30:19.363
No, he didn't.

30:19.930 --> 30:22.968
The DLA uses RSA Secure ID.

30:23.535 --> 30:27.398
It's a hardware token that regenerates
authentication every minute.

30:27.422 --> 30:30.374
If Wong had a partner, the best way
to give him access would be to...

30:30.398 --> 30:31.736
Bug himself.

30:33.043 --> 30:36.319
- Does this record more than passwords?
- It records everything that's typed.

30:36.343 --> 30:38.381
- Okay, let's see it.
- But we can't.

30:38.405 --> 30:40.381
'Cause it broadcasts and it then dumps.

30:40.405 --> 30:42.360
You could try the buffer.

30:46.903 --> 30:50.027
Sorry. You guys say that every
once in awhile, so I thought...

30:51.332 --> 30:52.356
He's right.

30:52.380 --> 30:53.694
- He is?
- I am?

30:53.718 --> 30:58.143
If we treat the buffer like a normal
hard drive, even if it erased itself,

30:58.167 --> 31:00.117
we should be able to
get something off of it.

31:00.141 --> 31:02.063
Accessing the RAM buffer.

31:04.646 --> 31:06.311
We've got something.

31:06.654 --> 31:10.149
Wong was looking for directions
to an abandoned DLA warehouse.

31:10.173 --> 31:12.171
Perhaps a rendezvous with his buyers?

31:12.195 --> 31:13.784
Or he was worried we'd trace the murder

31:13.808 --> 31:16.260
of Petty Officer Lynn to
him and he decided to run.

31:16.284 --> 31:18.166
- Address.
- Got it.

31:18.664 --> 31:20.432
That's good work, Abs.

31:36.509 --> 31:37.790
Nice place.

31:37.814 --> 31:40.193
Don't think Wong chose
this location for scenery.

31:40.217 --> 31:41.711
McGee, DiNozzo.

31:48.969 --> 31:51.627
If Wong was running,
he didn't get very far.

31:57.411 --> 31:58.647
Federal agents!

32:11.907 --> 32:15.215
Wrong. He got about
as far as he could get.

32:22.922 --> 32:28.604
The telltale inverted "V", combined with
the hemorrhaging of the lips and eyelids,

32:28.628 --> 32:31.900
fractured cervical vertebrae...

32:31.924 --> 32:36.339
No evidence of any drugs in his
system, and only his DNA on the rope.

32:36.363 --> 32:38.185
Let me guess... he hung himself.

32:38.209 --> 32:40.075
It certainly would pear that way.

32:40.099 --> 32:42.068
- He have any help?
- He may have.

32:42.092 --> 32:47.844
A murder could easily cover up a ligature
strangulation with a post-mortem hanging.

32:48.109 --> 32:51.580
I understand there was some
kind of note from Mr. Wong.

32:51.604 --> 32:54.023
Took the credit for
killing Petty Officer Lynn.

32:54.178 --> 32:57.557
Wong said he and Lynn were partners
on a con, embezzling from the DLA,

32:57.581 --> 33:00.228
until Lynn tried to blackmail
Wong out of his share.

33:00.252 --> 33:01.811
So Wong killed him.

33:01.835 --> 33:03.147
Tried to make it look like a mugging.

33:03.171 --> 33:06.562
Then he panicked when he learned
NCIS figured out it wasn't.

33:06.586 --> 33:09.927
"I'm sorry, I never meant
for any of this to happen.

33:09.951 --> 33:11.426
"May God have mercy.

33:12.302 --> 33:13.792
David B. Wong".

33:13.816 --> 33:16.004
Abby verified the handwriting.

33:16.028 --> 33:19.584
You know, the vomit near the body

33:19.608 --> 33:22.500
contained copious
amounts of cheese blintz.

33:22.757 --> 33:25.669
David Wong was lactose intolerant.

33:25.693 --> 33:30.041
If he had consumed that much cheese,
that would explain his throwing up.

33:30.065 --> 33:31.898
Puts Wong at the underpass.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.838
Which corroborates his letter.

33:33.862 --> 33:35.383
Yet you doubt it?

33:35.407 --> 33:36.971
Mugging wasn't a mugging.

33:36.995 --> 33:39.700
So the suicide may not be a suicide.

33:39.724 --> 33:42.430
In the mugging, certain
key facts did not add up.

33:42.454 --> 33:45.357
But here, I'm afraid, there
are no such discrepancies.

33:45.381 --> 33:49.563
Well, I've got a discrepancy.
Evidence bag says David G. Wong.

33:49.587 --> 33:51.680
Yes. His middle name was George.

33:51.704 --> 33:54.296
Then why'd he sign his name with a "B"?

33:54.674 --> 33:56.487
Perhaps he was a sending us a message.

33:56.511 --> 33:58.653
Letter "B" is not much of a message.

33:58.677 --> 34:01.378
I find it very doubtful
that he would make a mistake.

34:01.402 --> 34:03.055
Besides, if he wrote
a note under duress,

34:03.079 --> 34:06.409
the message would have to be
something the killer would not notice.

34:06.700 --> 34:08.360
Could be part of the killer's initials.

34:08.385 --> 34:10.297
- Is that at you'd write, DiNozzo?
- No.

34:10.321 --> 34:13.266
Two letters would be circumstantial,
one letter is just useless.

34:13.291 --> 34:17.018
Perhaps there's another place where
David Wong used the false initial.

34:17.042 --> 34:19.830
I already checked. DMV, bank records.

34:19.853 --> 34:23.487
Only place that Wong used the
letter "B" is on the suicide note.

34:23.511 --> 34:26.136
Maybe it wasn't one
letter then. McGee, run it.

34:26.376 --> 34:28.699
Whoa, stop it right there. There.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.737
- What?
- The Bs are different.

34:33.985 --> 34:35.199
Thirteen.

34:35.224 --> 34:36.947
It's not a letter. It's a number.

34:36.972 --> 34:38.844
Actually, I think it's both.

34:39.290 --> 34:42.463
Boss, I think this is an
"I" and a three together.

34:42.487 --> 34:45.597
After Wong's suicide note, I
checked his office's records.

34:45.621 --> 34:47.594
They code their invoices
with an "I" followed

34:47.619 --> 34:50.290
by a number corresponding to department.

34:50.313 --> 34:52.127
I've gotten as far as I-5,

34:52.150 --> 34:54.856
but I didn't find anything to
corroborate the claim of embezzment.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.933
Look again.

34:56.956 --> 34:59.575
That's good advice, Gibbs.
That's exactly what I did.

34:59.599 --> 35:01.831
You're going to love what I found.

35:02.471 --> 35:04.782
The first thing I did
when I got the photos...

35:04.806 --> 35:07.806
Was run facial-recognition software
on every face you could find.

35:07.830 --> 35:09.107
Which led nowhere.

35:09.131 --> 35:11.719
Thank you both for that
reminder of my failure.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.897
Haven't failed me yet, Abs.

35:14.464 --> 35:17.461
I thought I had squeezed all the
data I could out of the photos,

35:17.485 --> 35:19.990
until Jackson Scott
walked in and humbled me.

35:20.014 --> 35:23.717
The man uses echolocation
to find obstacles in his way.

35:23.940 --> 35:27.282
No Shamu jokes. Echolocation
is reflected sound,

35:27.306 --> 35:32.338
which made me think of reflected
images. Which made me find... this.

35:36.836 --> 35:38.904
I know, it's a blur,

35:38.928 --> 35:41.435
but that's because the
photons of light in the image,

35:41.459 --> 35:43.184
they're spread out in time.

35:43.208 --> 35:44.371
But you can de-spread them.

35:44.395 --> 35:47.517
Well, the technical term is
"deconvolution," but yeah.

35:47.541 --> 35:52.533
So I calculated the shutter speed,
merging the photons into a coherent image.

35:52.557 --> 35:55.194
The final results are still processing.

35:55.218 --> 35:58.727
But this is good enough
for an ID. Look familiar?

36:03.891 --> 36:06.685
Relax. There's nothing
to be nervous about.

36:06.709 --> 36:08.555
Then why am I in an interrogation room?

36:08.579 --> 36:09.962
That's a good point.

36:09.986 --> 36:11.492
Maybe you should be nervous.

36:12.024 --> 36:13.597
I haven't done anything wrong.

36:13.621 --> 36:15.252
Actually, you did.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.646
But we're going to give you
another chance to correct it.

36:18.820 --> 36:20.554
So, tell us again,

36:20.914 --> 36:24.024
where were you the night
your boss took this picture?

36:25.878 --> 36:27.536
I told you already.

36:27.560 --> 36:31.001
I was in Mr. Scott's office until
6:00. And then I went straight home.

36:31.671 --> 36:33.621
She was at your loft when you left?

36:33.645 --> 36:35.428
Told you that already, too.

36:35.865 --> 36:37.969
I'm blind, but you guys are deaf.

36:38.458 --> 36:39.748
You believe her?

36:39.772 --> 36:42.011
Well, why would I think she's lying?

36:42.035 --> 36:43.359
Because she is.

36:43.383 --> 36:45.213
So if you went straight home,

36:45.237 --> 36:48.477
then what are you doing in this
photo your boss took that night?

36:53.232 --> 36:55.874
It's interesting you
didn't notice she was there.

36:55.898 --> 36:57.816
Yet you noticed everything else.

36:58.262 --> 36:59.533
I see.

36:59.850 --> 37:02.419
She's not the only
one being interrogated.

37:02.443 --> 37:04.347
Care to change your testimony?

37:04.571 --> 37:06.579
I took the long way home.

37:06.897 --> 37:09.619
I must have walked by
where Mr Scott was shooting.

37:10.102 --> 37:12.062
If I did, I didn't realize he was there.

37:12.086 --> 37:14.652
So you two were within
20 feet of each other...

37:14.676 --> 37:17.233
And neither of you knew
the other was there.

37:17.456 --> 37:19.066
It's possible Bryn
wouldn't have noticed me.

37:19.090 --> 37:21.681
I work hard to keep myself
below people's radar.

37:22.265 --> 37:24.565
But I would have certainly noticed her.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.436
Why didn't you?

37:28.027 --> 37:29.411
I don't know.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.996
We showed your photo to
the staff at the restaurant

37:33.020 --> 37:36.208
where Petty Officer Lynn
was having his last supper.

37:36.232 --> 37:39.245
And one of the waiters
identified you at the lobby.

37:39.269 --> 37:42.782
You being at the same restaurant as
Petty Officer Lynn a coincidence, too?

37:42.806 --> 37:44.656
Because I don't think the
jury will see it that way.

37:44.680 --> 37:47.732
What they will see is the person

37:47.756 --> 37:50.906
he had dinner with then
lured him to the underpass,

37:50.930 --> 37:52.698
- and stabbed him to death.
- No.

37:52.722 --> 37:55.492
- It's not what happened.
- Then tell me what did!

37:58.152 --> 38:00.860
I was following Mr. Scott.

38:01.774 --> 38:03.607
But I lost him for a few minutes.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.297
I just ducked into the restaurant

38:06.321 --> 38:09.066
for a second when he came around
the corner and surprised me.

38:11.213 --> 38:13.817
Jackson's harder to
follow than you'd think.

38:15.838 --> 38:19.115
I have to wear special shoes
and perfume when I follow him.

38:19.479 --> 38:21.263
Fruity perfume by any chance?

38:21.814 --> 38:24.076
- Lavender.
- Why were you following him?

38:24.374 --> 38:26.248
- I don't understand this.
- Why were you following him?

38:26.272 --> 38:29.594
- I was the one who called NCIS...
- Why were you following him?!

38:34.305 --> 38:35.696
You're in love with him.

38:40.759 --> 38:42.844
If you think his photos are brilliant,

38:44.440 --> 38:46.449
you should see him work.

38:47.289 --> 38:50.740
He can't see, but he still
sees more than most people.

38:53.197 --> 38:56.874
I lied to you, because if Jackson
knew I was following him...

39:01.450 --> 39:03.227
I didn't see your petty officer.

39:04.010 --> 39:05.883
And if he was there when I was,

39:07.174 --> 39:08.882
I wouldn't have noticed.

39:15.197 --> 39:17.960
For a man who can see
more than most people, I...

39:17.984 --> 39:21.028
managed to miss the thing
that counts the most.

39:22.247 --> 39:24.055
Better late than never, I suppose.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.372
- You going to let her go now?
- Now, no.

39:27.396 --> 39:29.204
After we corroborate, yeah.

39:29.228 --> 39:31.783
Maybe Wong's suicide
note was legit after all.

39:34.530 --> 39:35.612
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:36.247 --> 39:40.144
I was just looking for some
pipettes, which are clearly not here.

39:40.470 --> 39:41.517
Bye.

39:45.629 --> 39:46.790
What?

39:47.885 --> 39:49.662
The fruit smell from that night.

39:50.948 --> 39:53.156
Oh. Oh, my gosh.

39:53.414 --> 39:55.112
I forgot to take my insulin.

39:55.136 --> 39:59.050
I was so busy looking for
the pipettes that I forgot.

39:59.074 --> 40:00.339
Insulin?

40:00.906 --> 40:02.796
Yeah, I have mild diabetes.

40:02.820 --> 40:07.022
When my blood sugar spikes, my
breath gets a mild fruity smell.

40:07.588 --> 40:09.906
Is it really that bad?

40:10.982 --> 40:14.530
Why is everyone looking at me
like I'm in some kind of trouble?

40:22.200 --> 40:23.674
Well, I got your message.

40:23.698 --> 40:25.799
What's this about a
breach of our security?

40:25.823 --> 40:28.759
We believe someone's been running a
bogus investigation out of your office.

40:28.783 --> 40:30.002
The Lynn case?

40:30.260 --> 40:32.872
Our suspect told Petty
Officer Lynn a co-worker

40:33.136 --> 40:35.279
was under investigation for embezzling.

40:35.303 --> 40:36.659
A lie.

40:36.683 --> 40:40.060
And asked Lynn to plant a
bug in the co-worker's office.

40:40.644 --> 40:42.446
That co-worker was David Wong.

40:42.721 --> 40:46.394
The lie was to get Wong's password
to the DLA accounting database.

40:46.419 --> 40:48.833
The suspect was the
one who was embezzling.

40:48.857 --> 40:51.532
You can check DLA ledger
I-three. It's all there.

40:51.556 --> 40:56.367
The funny part is Wong grew suspicious
and contacted you, which is ironic, since

40:56.391 --> 40:57.922
you were the one running
the bogus investigation

40:57.946 --> 40:59.645
out of this office in the first place.

40:59.669 --> 41:03.073
We traced the log-ons to DLA's
servers back to your computer.

41:03.097 --> 41:06.181
Also, a waiter places you
at the restaurant with Lynn.

41:06.205 --> 41:07.670
And we have come to believe that it was.

41:07.694 --> 41:10.937
Colonel Mustard in the
conservatory with a wrench.

41:12.379 --> 41:13.463
How?

41:14.495 --> 41:18.100
Jackson Scott decided
to follow the fruit.

41:20.555 --> 41:24.194
As a diabetic, you should've
skipped the cheese blintz.

41:38.794 --> 41:40.336
You're done already.

41:41.919 --> 41:43.770
Thought you said it was
going to take awhile.

41:43.794 --> 41:45.648
Nope. Worked all night.

41:45.672 --> 41:47.542
And what's the rush?

41:54.632 --> 41:58.730
Oh, I see. So that's
how it's gonna be, huh?

42:00.961 --> 42:02.750
- Hol, I wanted...
- No. Don't...

42:03.014 --> 42:04.044
Don't say it.

42:04.578 --> 42:06.705
Don't say anything.

42:07.117 --> 42:10.688
Not that you ever do anyway. But you
know what? I'm gonna say something.

42:11.481 --> 42:12.814
You're making a mistake.

42:13.357 --> 42:15.482
You're going to wake
up in a week or a month

42:15.506 --> 42:17.808
and you're going to realize that
you threw away something good,

42:17.832 --> 42:19.535
and it's gonna be too late.

42:19.559 --> 42:22.436
You know, I realize that there
are three billion men in the world,

42:22.460 --> 42:25.867
and they don't all have to
want me, but you should want me.

42:30.545 --> 42:33.837
The fact that you don't,
it just makes me wonder

42:33.861 --> 42:37.777
why I ever wanted you
in the first place.

42:39.670 --> 42:41.392
Are you going to say something?

42:42.378 --> 42:44.936
- You told me not to.
- Well, I changed my mind.

42:48.648 --> 42:50.128
I worked through the night

42:50.152 --> 42:53.356
because I found another
small leak in your bathroom,

42:54.752 --> 42:56.847
and I wanted to surprise you.

43:01.087 --> 43:02.941
Bigger job than I thought.

43:05.286 --> 43:07.231
And how long is this gonna take?

43:09.777 --> 43:11.202
Could take awhile.

43:13.743 --> 43:15.775
- I feel like an idiot.
- Sounded like one.

43:21.720 --> 43:23.969
How do I make it up to you?
