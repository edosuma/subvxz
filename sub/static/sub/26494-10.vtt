00:01.811 --> 00:02.811
Impossible odds.

00:05.047 --> 00:06.180
Walking right into
a trap.

00:08.183 --> 00:09.349
Feels like home.

00:10.586 --> 00:11.952
Michael conned me.

00:11.954 --> 00:14.288
Kept me trapped and drowning
inside my own body.

00:14.290 --> 00:16.155
I own you.

00:16.158 --> 00:17.791
And he's out there
hurting people.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.228
His name. Gadreel.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.696
I have Sam locked away
in a dream.

00:22.698 --> 00:24.198
Say "Poughkeepsie."

00:24.200 --> 00:25.832
It's our go word. It means
"drop everything and run."

00:25.834 --> 00:27.501
Get...out!

00:28.444 --> 00:30.569
I know this must be
so hard without your grace.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.608
Jack!

00:34.610 --> 00:35.976
Please don't be sad.

00:35.978 --> 00:39.012
Maybe this is how
things are supposed to be.

00:39.014 --> 00:40.547
He's gone.

00:40.549 --> 00:42.983
Here's to you, Jack.

00:42.985 --> 00:45.786
My magic draws power
from the human soul.

00:45.788 --> 00:46.753
It could save him.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.222
If Jack is in Heaven,

00:48.224 --> 00:51.625
I might be able to pull
his soul into his body.

00:53.162 --> 00:54.861
With the spear
still in play,

00:54.863 --> 00:57.331
could be a shot at actually
killing the son of a bitch.

01:00.636 --> 01:02.202
No.

01:02.204 --> 01:04.805
When I gave up Dean,
you didn't think to question?

01:04.807 --> 01:06.573
This time, he is buried.

01:06.575 --> 01:07.674
And now...

01:07.676 --> 01:09.743
I have a whole army

were a war zone.

- Oh! Mr. Winchester.

02:47.215 --> 02:48.681
And the time before that.

02:49.951 --> 02:51.651
I brought the papers
I mentioned.

02:51.653 --> 02:53.520
I know you said
you weren't interested,

02:53.522 --> 02:56.422
but it's just a few signatures
and you could --

02:56.424 --> 02:58.825
Can I get you a drink?

02:58.827 --> 03:00.426
I'm in a bit of a rush.

03:01.963 --> 03:03.997
Well, sorry you wasted
your trip out here,

03:03.999 --> 03:08.334
but, um...Rocky's

03:08.336 --> 03:12.605
Rocky's

03:12.607 --> 03:14.674

03:14.676 --> 03:18.344
Well, all the same,

03:18.346 --> 03:21.281

Whoa.

04:15.770 --> 04:18.771
So, still not ready
to sell the bar, huh?

04:18.773 --> 04:20.839
It's a lot of money.

07:39.440 --> 07:42.608
Maggie? Hey.
What's happening out there?

07:42.610 --> 07:44.744
I brought every hunter
I could find, like you said,

07:44.746 --> 07:47.013
and we're trying to track down
the monsters,

07:47.015 --> 07:50.216
but, uh,
there's so many of them.

07:50.218 --> 07:53.553
We're getting reports
of attacks all over the city.

07:53.555 --> 07:56.389
No kills, just bites
or scratches.

07:56.391 --> 07:58.090
<i>It's like they're</i>

07:58.092 --> 08:00.326

08:00.328 --> 08:02.228
Top of Hitomi Plaza,
10th and Main.

08:02.230 --> 08:03.830
- We've got Michael.
- Do you?

08:03.832 --> 08:05.398
<i>Okay, we'll get there</i>

Michael's under control.

08:18.279 --> 08:19.879
Keep telling yourself
that.

08:19.881 --> 08:22.515
Get him downstairs, dump him
in the trunk of the Impala,

08:22.517 --> 08:23.883
and take him
back to the bunker.

08:23.885 --> 08:25.384
But Garth is in the trunk.

08:27.055 --> 08:28.354
It's a big trunk.

08:33.160 --> 08:35.361
Monsters!

08:35.363 --> 08:37.129
More like the Calvary.

08:39.601 --> 08:41.033
I called them.

08:43.203 --> 08:44.704
It's a party.

08:44.706 --> 08:46.973
Sam, I don't know how long
I can hold them.

08:46.975 --> 08:48.641
Yeah, well, we have to
get Dean out of here.

08:48.643 --> 08:49.976
Yeah, well,
we can't go this way.

09:11.699 --> 09:13.866

Death assigned a reaper

09:13.868 --> 09:15.334

on Dean and me.

09:15.336 --> 09:17.103
Her name is Jessica,

09:17.105 --> 09:18.237
Hello.

09:20.742 --> 09:21.908
Where's Jessica?

09:21.910 --> 09:24.510
Well, my name's Violet.
It's my shift.

09:24.512 --> 09:25.778
We have shifts now,

09:25.780 --> 09:28.147

so many things.

09:31.052 --> 09:32.618

09:32.620 --> 09:34.854
Okay, all right. Well, Violet,
we have to get out of here.

09:34.856 --> 09:36.122
And I want you
to know that

09:36.124 --> 09:37.556

09:37.558 --> 09:38.991
W-We don't want
your emotional support.

09:38.993 --> 09:41.060

physical help.

09:41.062 --> 09:43.296

09:43.298 --> 09:44.630
You can't see her?

09:45.967 --> 09:47.967
I can.

09:47.969 --> 09:49.335
You know, in my world,

09:49.337 --> 09:52.438
we locked Death away
and enslave the reapers.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.907
Lovely. Well,
just look at you now.

09:54.909 --> 09:56.475
Okay, look, sorry,
but we're stuck, okay?

09:56.477 --> 09:57.643
And Death owes us one

09:57.645 --> 09:58.844
after we fixed
that whole Rowena thing.

09:58.846 --> 10:00.212
You know about that, right?

10:00.214 --> 10:02.949
Oh, yes, the Rowena thing
<i>you</i> started.

10:04.152 --> 10:05.651
We're gonna die here.

10:05.653 --> 10:08.888
- And my brother --
- Reapers can't intervene -- and rules.

10:08.890 --> 10:10.289
Don't give me that whole
clean hands --

10:10.291 --> 10:11.757

feel inclined, uh,

10:11.759 --> 10:13.259
we don't have access
to that kind of --

10:13.261 --> 10:15.227
- Yeah, well, uh --
- Shh, shh.

10:15.229 --> 10:18.431
Sam, what is she saying?

10:20.635 --> 10:22.835
She's not saying
anything.

10:22.837 --> 10:23.836
Okay.

10:23.838 --> 10:24.904
What?

10:30.578 --> 10:31.944
How did you do that?

10:31.946 --> 10:33.646
I, uh, didn't.

10:34.882 --> 10:36.182
Have fun.

10:43.291 --> 10:44.623
Now what?

10:54.235 --> 10:58.137
Shouldn't we put him in
the dungeon or something?

10:58.139 --> 10:59.638
Jack's right --
we don't know

10:59.640 --> 11:01.207
how long those cuffs
are gonna hold.

11:01.209 --> 11:02.708
I mean, Bobby improved them,
but --

11:02.710 --> 11:05.745
If those cuffs won't hold him,
neither will the dungeon.

11:05.747 --> 11:07.813
I can hear you.

11:10.618 --> 11:12.051
Really?

11:14.522 --> 11:16.022
Okay, so, what?

11:16.024 --> 11:18.357
Okay, listen.
Back when Gadreel possessed me,

11:18.359 --> 11:20.059
he -- he created,
uh, I don't know,

11:20.061 --> 11:22.161
like a -- like a fake world
inside my head.

11:22.163 --> 11:23.963
But Crowley was able
to force his way in,

11:23.965 --> 11:25.197
he showed me
how to take control,

11:25.199 --> 11:27.233
and I drove the angel out.

11:27.235 --> 11:29.568
The problem is...
Crowley's dead.

11:29.570 --> 11:30.870
Yeah.

11:30.872 --> 11:32.304
Okay, so...

11:33.641 --> 11:35.941
Sorry. It's Maggie.

11:35.943 --> 11:36.868
Hey.

11:36.892 --> 11:38.812
Sam, we're almost

11:38.813 --> 11:40.146
A-All right, uh,
yeah, we're, uh --

11:40.148 --> 11:41.647
we're actually
back at the bunker.

11:41.649 --> 11:42.335
What?!

11:42.359 --> 11:43.817
Yeah, long story.
I'll explain later.

11:43.818 --> 11:46.285
Uh, Maggie, we, uh --
we left Garth in the trunk

11:46.287 --> 11:48.020
of the Impala
back at Hitomi Plaza.

11:48.022 --> 11:49.321
<i>Can you make sure</i>
<i>he's okay?</i>

11:49.323 --> 11:51.524
Okay, but, Sam,
the monsters --

11:51.526 --> 11:53.626
they've stopped
attacking people.

11:53.628 --> 11:55.828
- What?
- <i>Looks like they're leaving the city.</i>

11:55.830 --> 11:56.929
<i>They're heading west.</i>

11:56.931 --> 11:58.798
Remind me, Castiel --

11:58.800 --> 12:01.200
we're west
of Kansas City now?

12:01.202 --> 12:02.968
You're bringing
them here?

12:02.970 --> 12:04.203
You think?

12:04.205 --> 12:06.939
Jack,
let's lock it down.

12:08.142 --> 12:11.377
Yes, uh, put a chair against the door.

12:11.379 --> 12:12.945
That'll help.

12:14.315 --> 12:16.615
Nothing's changed.

12:16.617 --> 12:18.851
Either my monsters get here

12:18.853 --> 12:21.520
or I break these chains.

12:21.522 --> 12:24.957
But tonight...
everybody dies.

12:25.693 --> 12:27.393
And, Sam?

12:27.395 --> 12:29.995
The last thing you'll see

12:29.997 --> 12:32.298
is this pretty smile...

12:33.067 --> 12:35.367
...as I rip you apart.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.324
What is that?

12:48.326 --> 12:49.658
It's the, uh,

12:49.660 --> 12:51.660
messed up
British Men of Letters thing

12:51.662 --> 12:53.429
they used to get
inside people's heads.

12:53.431 --> 12:55.931
I figure if I can get in,
maybe I can wake Dean up,

12:55.933 --> 12:58.300
get him to fight, you know,
to force Michael out.

13:00.972 --> 13:03.272
If he can.

13:03.274 --> 13:04.540
Yeah.

13:05.776 --> 13:07.977
Cass, this is
all we got.

13:11.816 --> 13:13.315
Any word from Sam?

13:13.317 --> 13:16.652
Still working that ghoul thing
in Wichita with Cass.

13:16.654 --> 13:18.120
They should be back tonight.

13:18.122 --> 13:19.655
Ohh!

13:24.495 --> 13:26.128
Ha!

13:26.130 --> 13:27.263
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

13:27.265 --> 13:29.131
- Ha! Oh!
- More shots!

13:38.342 --> 13:39.975
Oh! Mr. Winchester.

13:39.977 --> 13:42.311
♪ I rode into town today ♪

13:42.313 --> 13:44.346

you weren't interested,

13:46.117 --> 13:48.517
but it's just a few signatures
and you could --

13:48.519 --> 13:50.586

13:50.588 --> 13:53.789
I'm in a bit of a rush,
so if you could...?

13:55.459 --> 13:57.059

13:57.061 --> 14:00.196
Still working that ghoul thing

14:13.444 --> 14:14.743
Nice.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.813
Any word from Sam?

14:17.815 --> 14:20.916
Still working that ghoul thing

14:20.918 --> 14:23.519

14:33.564 --> 14:36.365
So, they left you

14:36.367 --> 14:40.102
Gotta say,
little insulting.

14:40.104 --> 14:42.471
I mean, what are you?

14:42.473 --> 14:43.739
You're nothing.

14:43.741 --> 14:46.308
That's not what
you said before.

14:46.310 --> 14:48.043
Ah. Yes.

14:48.045 --> 14:50.779
A moment of
familial weakness.

14:50.781 --> 14:53.449
- It won't happen again.
- It doesn't matter.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.686
Sam and Dean --

14:57.688 --> 15:00.289
they're gonna
beat you.

15:00.291 --> 15:02.324
Oh, please.

15:02.326 --> 15:05.628
Sam's in so far over his head,
he's drowning.

15:05.630 --> 15:06.795
And Dean?

15:06.797 --> 15:09.865
Well, I've got Dean
under control.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.767
No.

15:11.769 --> 15:13.869
Dean --

15:13.871 --> 15:15.504
he's strong.

15:15.506 --> 15:17.940
He's a gnat.

15:17.942 --> 15:19.642
I'm a god.

15:19.644 --> 15:21.343
Who would you bet on?

15:23.281 --> 15:25.648
You don't know anything
about Dean.

15:25.650 --> 15:29.184
I'm in his head...
literally.

15:29.186 --> 15:31.620
I know everything.

15:31.622 --> 15:36.892
Like, I know how sad he was
when you died...

15:36.894 --> 15:39.595
on the outside.

15:39.597 --> 15:41.930
On the inside, well,

15:41.932 --> 15:44.300
it's not that
he was happy --

15:44.302 --> 15:47.303
he just didn't care.

15:47.305 --> 15:49.371
'Cause you're not Sam.

15:49.373 --> 15:51.106
You're not Cass.

15:51.108 --> 15:54.977
You're a new burden
that he was handed.

15:56.447 --> 15:59.615
You're a weak,
helpless thing.

15:59.617 --> 16:02.785
You think that
they care about you,

16:02.787 --> 16:04.720
love you?

16:04.722 --> 16:07.222
You're a job,

16:07.224 --> 16:10.192
a job none of them
wanted.

16:10.194 --> 16:11.760
- And you --
- Jack?

16:18.669 --> 16:19.935
Go help Sam.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.103
Wait.

16:23.074 --> 16:26.909
Don't believe
anything he says.

16:26.911 --> 16:28.143
He's lying.

16:28.145 --> 16:29.845
No, I'm not.

16:29.847 --> 16:32.348
And I can still
hear you.

16:38.589 --> 16:40.889
<i>Maggie? Maggie?</i>
<i>You there?</i>

16:40.891 --> 16:41.995
Yeah?

16:42.019 --> 16:43.460
<i>A group of them</i>
<i>got out in front of us,</i>

16:43.461 --> 16:45.561
<i>headed your way</i>
<i>in a black van.</i>

16:45.563 --> 16:47.763
Right. We'll be ready.

16:49.367 --> 16:53.502
Okay. We've, uh, got some heavy
hitters coming through soon.

16:53.504 --> 16:55.571
And...

16:55.573 --> 16:57.239
And Sam needs our help.

16:57.241 --> 17:00.709
You all know what the
Winchesters have done for us.

17:00.711 --> 17:03.746
- They gave us all a second chance.
- Maggie?

17:09.587 --> 17:10.953
Whatever happens,

17:10.954 --> 17:13.355
we can't let the monsters
get back to the bunker.

17:19.964 --> 17:22.297
Look at you.

17:22.299 --> 17:25.968
Playing nursemaid
to an nephilim.

17:25.970 --> 17:28.503
Nothing like
the Castiel I knew.

17:28.506 --> 17:32.007
He would've never been
so...anemic.

17:33.444 --> 17:37.479
You're confusing loyalty
and compassion with weakness.

17:39.383 --> 17:40.916
Tell me.

17:40.918 --> 17:44.520
Why do you love this world
enough to risk your own life?

17:44.522 --> 17:45.921
Tell me.

17:45.923 --> 17:50.325
Why do you hate this world
enough to burn it to the ground?

17:50.327 --> 17:51.994
Because I can.

17:53.931 --> 17:55.597
Because...

18:00.538 --> 18:04.740
Me and my brother --
my Lucifer --

18:04.742 --> 18:08.110
when we fought
in my world,

18:08.112 --> 18:11.246
we thought that God
would come back,

18:11.248 --> 18:12.948
give us answers --

18:12.950 --> 18:16.318
why He'd gone,
what we'd done --

18:16.320 --> 18:19.588
but, instead,
do you know what happened?

18:19.590 --> 18:21.123
Nothing.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.694
No God.

18:25.696 --> 18:27.463
Nothing.

18:27.998 --> 18:29.031
And now...

18:29.033 --> 18:33.068
now that I'm in here --

18:33.070 --> 18:34.803
now I know why.

18:36.507 --> 18:40.042
God -- Chuck --

18:40.044 --> 18:41.310
is a writer,

18:41.312 --> 18:43.278
and like all writers,

18:43.280 --> 18:48.016
He churns out
draft after draft.

18:48.018 --> 18:52.654
My world? This world?

18:52.656 --> 18:55.357
Nothing
but failed drafts.

18:55.359 --> 18:58.760
And when He realizes
that they're flawed,

18:58.762 --> 19:02.498
He moves on
and tries again.

19:04.168 --> 19:06.535
No, that's not how...

19:08.639 --> 19:10.005
Why would He do that?

19:10.007 --> 19:13.342
Because He doesn't care!

19:13.344 --> 19:18.780
About you, me --
anything.

19:18.782 --> 19:23.185
Now, at first, I thought
I'd do it better.

19:23.187 --> 19:24.586
Show Him.

19:24.588 --> 19:27.356
Be more God than God.

19:29.660 --> 19:31.426
But now...

19:31.428 --> 19:35.297
I just want to burn
every one of His little worlds

19:35.299 --> 19:39.768
until I catch up
to the old man.

19:39.770 --> 19:41.270
And then what?

19:44.475 --> 19:47.376
Even God can die.

19:52.116 --> 19:53.582
Hey, you in there!

19:53.584 --> 19:55.417
We've got you surrounded!

19:55.419 --> 19:57.586
- "We have you surrounded"?
- Shut up!

19:57.588 --> 19:59.087
Smithy, what do you see?

20:01.058 --> 20:03.025
No movement.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.893
Tiger, how about you?

20:06.564 --> 20:07.796
They're gone.

20:12.303 --> 20:14.069
There's some tracks here.

20:15.739 --> 20:17.406
Don't go in there alone!

20:28.686 --> 20:30.185
They're on foot.
They went around us.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.154
They're probably heading
for the bunker.

20:39.663 --> 20:42.998
This...
is it going to work?

20:44.568 --> 20:46.301
I don't know.

20:48.138 --> 20:51.440
Well, if it doesn't, maybe
there's something I can do.

20:52.776 --> 20:56.178
The magic that's
keeping me alive,

20:56.180 --> 20:58.981
what if I can do more?

20:58.983 --> 21:00.949
And burn off your soul?

21:00.951 --> 21:03.852
Not all of it.

21:03.854 --> 21:06.021
Jack.

21:06.023 --> 21:10.459
Dean wouldn't want to be saved,
not that way.

21:10.461 --> 21:13.128
You don't know what
you're walking into.

21:14.164 --> 21:15.797
Last time Dean
was possessed,

21:15.799 --> 21:18.700
he said it felt like
he was drowning.

21:18.702 --> 21:20.068
This time...

21:22.339 --> 21:23.438
What?

21:23.440 --> 21:25.240
It'll probably
be worse.

21:35.919 --> 21:38.153
Cool science project.

21:38.155 --> 21:41.323
I give it a solid B-minus.

21:41.325 --> 21:45.093
Okay, in theory, I should be
connected to Dean's mind.

21:45.095 --> 21:47.262
Cass, you should be able to
hitch a ride with me.

21:49.833 --> 21:51.600
Oh, Cass...

21:51.602 --> 21:53.402
I believe in you.

21:58.075 --> 22:00.275
What should I do?

22:00.277 --> 22:01.510
Pray.

22:01.512 --> 22:03.578
And make sure
no one kills us.

22:05.516 --> 22:07.282
Well, I like this plan.

22:07.284 --> 22:10.118
See, out here,
I'm all chained up.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.220
But in there...

22:12.222 --> 22:13.855
you're all mine.

22:16.827 --> 22:19.995
So...what are
we waiting for?

22:41.518 --> 22:43.819
Cass...

22:43.821 --> 22:45.987
where are we?

22:45.989 --> 22:47.889
In Dean's mind.

22:49.793 --> 22:52.561
Then where's he?

22:52.563 --> 22:54.996
Excellent question.

23:01.238 --> 23:02.738
<i>We had a deal!</i>

23:02.740 --> 23:04.072
<i>Wait. Hold on, okay?</i>
<i>We're coming.</i>

23:04.074 --> 23:05.207
<i>You can't escape me, Dean.</i>

23:05.209 --> 23:06.708
<i>You're gonna die.</i>

23:06.710 --> 23:09.411
<i>And</i> this -- <i>this is what</i>
<i>you're gonna become!</i>

23:09.413 --> 23:11.513
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

23:13.317 --> 23:14.883
<i>No!</i>
There's so much.

23:14.885 --> 23:16.852
<i>Your own father didn't care</i>
<i>whether you lived or died.</i>

23:16.854 --> 23:18.420
<i>It's about</i>
<i>who's the bigger badass.</i>

23:20.157 --> 23:24.259
So much trauma
in Dean's mind.

23:24.261 --> 23:25.861
So many scars.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.829
Well, yeah.

23:27.831 --> 23:30.298
Dean's been through a lot,
but he's strong.

23:30.300 --> 23:32.534
Sam...

23:32.536 --> 23:34.035
you've both
been through a lot,

23:34.037 --> 23:37.305
and Dean
is more than strong.

23:37.307 --> 23:39.975
What I meant was,
if I knew...

23:39.977 --> 23:41.810
if I knew
what I was looking for,

23:41.812 --> 23:45.113
I could just --
I could simply go to it.

23:45.115 --> 23:50.719
But because Michael has Dean
trapped away, drowning,

23:50.721 --> 23:52.020
I have to wade through

23:52.022 --> 23:56.158
all of Dean's
most terrible memories.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.794
Cass, wait a second.

23:58.796 --> 24:02.531
Would Michael bury Dean
in trauma?

24:05.402 --> 24:06.568
What do you mean?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.570
I mean,
Michael said it himself.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.071
The reason he left Dean
in the first place

24:10.073 --> 24:13.675
was because Dean was
fighting back so hard.

24:13.677 --> 24:17.045
So if Michael wanted
to keep Dean placated...

24:17.047 --> 24:19.614
Dean thrives on trauma.

24:19.616 --> 24:21.049
I mean, he's had to
his whole life, right?

24:21.051 --> 24:22.784
It keeps him alert,
keeps him ready,

24:22.786 --> 24:26.087
but if I wanted to
distract Dean, I-I...

24:26.089 --> 24:29.257
I'd give him something
he's never had before.

24:29.259 --> 24:31.426
- Contentment.
- Exactly.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.361
So maybe, instead of looking
through his bad memories,

24:33.363 --> 24:35.096
maybe let's, uh...

24:35.098 --> 24:37.632
maybe let's look through
his good memories.

24:40.037 --> 24:41.570
<i>I think I'm adorable.</i>

24:41.572 --> 24:42.871
<i>You seem pretty cheery.</i>

You don't mean that, Dean,
not really.

30:48.692 --> 30:50.859
You may lie to them,

I know you.

30:55.899 --> 30:58.433
I am you.

30:58.435 --> 31:02.170
You only tolerate the angel

31:09.346 --> 31:13.315

what has he done?

31:13.317 --> 31:15.016
Only made mistakes,

one after the other.

31:17.588 --> 31:20.021
And, Sam --
oh, Sam...

You know, Dean was his happiest
when you quit hunting,

31:23.660 --> 31:27.262
leaving him with your dad,
just the two of them.

31:27.264 --> 31:31.733
See, deep down, he knows that
you will always abandon him,

31:31.735 --> 31:34.069
again and again.

31:34.071 --> 31:36.471
Shut up!
You don't need them.

31:36.473 --> 31:38.206

They're not your family --

31:42.145 --> 31:45.347
They're a weight
around your neck.

31:45.349 --> 31:48.049
And deep down,
you wanted --

31:48.051 --> 31:51.920
you were desperate
to get away from them.

31:51.922 --> 31:55.223
And that is why
you said yes.

31:55.225 --> 31:57.926

shut your damn mouth!

31:57.928 --> 32:00.695

- Yes.

32:35.265 --> 32:36.665
You ready?

32:38.268 --> 32:40.168
Okay.

32:40.170 --> 32:42.170
He's buying time

32:42.172 --> 32:45.874
so his monsters can get to us
and rescue him.

32:45.876 --> 32:49.344
You think I need them
to save me?

32:49.346 --> 32:50.312
Please.

32:50.314 --> 32:52.113
Fine. You're so tough,

32:52.115 --> 32:55.317
why don't you snap your fingers
and nuke us all?

32:56.586 --> 32:59.387
Is that what you want?

32:59.389 --> 33:00.855
Yeah, I do.

33:03.193 --> 33:04.559
He can't.

33:04.561 --> 33:07.896
Because, in here, we're all
just mental projections,

33:07.898 --> 33:10.498
so in here,
we're all the same.

33:10.500 --> 33:13.735
So, in here,
you're all talk.

33:20.944 --> 33:24.245
You think I need
my powers?

33:24.247 --> 33:26.881
I destroy worlds,

33:26.883 --> 33:30.952
and I'd crush you
with my bare hands.

33:30.954 --> 33:32.420
Prove it.

34:10.127 --> 34:12.360
- Is that...?
- It's them.

34:12.362 --> 34:13.795
Okay, they can't.

34:13.797 --> 34:16.498
They won't be able
to get through the door.

34:16.500 --> 34:19.067
- They won't have to.
-Tiger?

34:19.069 --> 34:20.935
Tiger shouldn't have gone
in the woods alone.

34:23.607 --> 34:24.938
You should've locked the door.

35:01.678 --> 35:03.411
Whoa! Ow!

35:06.716 --> 35:08.249
No!

35:28.371 --> 35:32.140
You fellas didn't think
this out, did you?

35:32.142 --> 35:34.476
Even if you could
force me out,

35:34.478 --> 35:38.546
what do you think
I'd leave behind, hm?

35:38.548 --> 35:41.850
You'd be nothing
but blood and bone.

35:43.920 --> 35:46.988
Then we don't
kick him out.

35:46.990 --> 35:48.857
We keep him in.

36:04.841 --> 36:05.940
Aah!

36:07.677 --> 36:11.479
It'll hold.
My mind, my rules.

36:11.481 --> 36:13.281
I got him.

36:15.886 --> 36:17.452
I'm the Cage.

36:28.694 --> 36:32.596
We'll get the rest
of this cleaned up.

36:32.598 --> 36:34.631
Yeah.

36:34.633 --> 36:36.934
What about the rest
of Michael's monsters?

36:36.936 --> 36:38.535
We're getting in reports.

36:38.537 --> 36:39.737
After you guys woke up,

36:39.739 --> 36:42.840
they all just went
their separate ways.

36:42.842 --> 36:45.676
I guess Michael
can't control them now.

36:47.346 --> 36:48.746
Huh.

36:49.582 --> 36:52.616
Maggie...

36:52.618 --> 36:54.418
Thank you.

36:54.420 --> 36:55.552
For everything.

36:55.554 --> 36:58.255
It wasn't me.

36:58.257 --> 36:59.690
Jack, he...

37:01.093 --> 37:04.728
I didn't know he could
still do that angel stuff.

37:07.366 --> 37:09.800
Yeah. Yeah.

37:12.104 --> 37:13.370
I didn't, either.

37:13.372 --> 37:16.640
That magic
burns off your soul.

37:19.311 --> 37:22.179
It was an accident.
Yeah, but you can't afford

37:22.181 --> 37:24.014
that kind of accident.

37:24.016 --> 37:26.817
You need your soul
to stay alive, to --

37:26.819 --> 37:28.485
They would've killed you.

37:29.655 --> 37:31.221
I know.

37:33.058 --> 37:34.958
Look, I'm not mad at you.

37:36.328 --> 37:38.061
I...

37:39.498 --> 37:42.699
I've just seen firsthand what
the absence of a soul does.

37:42.701 --> 37:45.068
And it's not just about
you staying alive, Jack.

37:45.070 --> 37:47.604
It's about you staying you.

37:50.476 --> 37:52.276
You understand?

37:57.249 --> 37:59.183
It won't happen again.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.153
Okay.

38:19.205 --> 38:21.572
It's just you.

38:24.944 --> 38:28.679
It's just...you.

38:39.725 --> 38:41.625
Let me out! Come on!

38:51.537 --> 38:53.470
It's all you.

39:15.628 --> 39:17.361
Dean.

39:18.530 --> 39:21.531
So...not all good news.

39:23.669 --> 39:26.003
I did say
I'd see you again soon.

39:26.005 --> 39:27.537
You could've knocked.

39:27.539 --> 39:31.975
Figured all that banging on the
door in your head was enough.

39:31.977 --> 39:34.745
Michael's all locked up.

39:34.747 --> 39:36.747
Seems that way.

39:38.651 --> 39:40.384
Sam said that
one of your reapers

39:40.386 --> 39:41.818
really came through
with the assist.

39:41.820 --> 39:45.522
I'm thinking
that was probably you.

39:45.524 --> 39:48.125
Don't tell anyone.

39:48.127 --> 39:49.593
You broke the rules.

39:49.595 --> 39:52.930
I took a calculated risk.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.865
I warned you

39:54.867 --> 39:59.403
about the dangers of jumping
from world to world.

39:59.405 --> 40:04.241
But you ignored me,
didn't you?

40:05.511 --> 40:08.278
Rescuing Mom and Jack,

40:08.280 --> 40:10.814
helping out
those other folks --

40:10.816 --> 40:12.716
I'd say it was worth it.

40:12.718 --> 40:14.818
And just look at you now.

40:18.157 --> 40:21.625
Do you remember visiting
my reading room?

40:21.627 --> 40:23.961
The shelves and shelves
of notebooks

40:23.963 --> 40:26.730
describing the ways
you might die?

40:26.732 --> 40:28.165
Yeah.

40:28.167 --> 40:30.567
Upbeat classics.

40:30.569 --> 40:33.704
Well, it's
the funniest thing,

40:33.706 --> 40:36.406
but they've all
been rewritten.

40:37.443 --> 40:40.844
They all end
the same way now --

40:40.846 --> 40:43.947
with the archangel Michael
escaping your mind

40:43.949 --> 40:48.685
and using you as his vessel
to burn down this world.

40:51.323 --> 40:52.689
All of them?

40:52.691 --> 40:54.424
All of them.

40:57.096 --> 40:59.062
Except one.

41:19.618 --> 41:22.686
What am I supposed to do
with this?

41:22.688 --> 41:24.354
That's up to you.

41:44.942 --> 41:51.942
