IT MEANS A LOT MORE
THAN THAT.

37:36.248 --> 37:38.048
UM, WOULD YOU MIND
GIVING ME A MINUTE

37:38.183 --> 37:39.582
WITH THESE TWO, PLEASE?

37:39.718 --> 37:40.684
ANATOLY: YES.
LAUREL: SURE.

37:40.819 --> 37:42.452
AH. LEAVE THE BOTTLE.

37:46.191 --> 37:49.793
I KNOW THAT I HAVEN'T REALLY
SPOKEN TO THE TWO OF YOU

37:49.928 --> 37:52.595
ABOUT MY TIME IN RUSSIA.

37:52.731 --> 37:56.800
AND THAT IS BECAUSE
THERE WERE SOME THINGS
THAT I DID HERE

37:56.935 --> 37:58.702
THAT I'M NOT
VERY PROUD OF.

37:58.837 --> 38:03.707
AS I'M COMING TO GRIPS
WITH THE FACT THAT THE TWO
OF YOU ARE GROWN UP,

38:03.842 --> 38:05.141
I'M REALIZING THAT

38:05.277 --> 38:08.345
SHIELDING YOU FROM THE BAD

38:08.480 --> 38:13.416
ISN'T GOING TO DO
OUR RELATIONSHIPS ANY GOOD.

38:13.552 --> 38:16.786
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD,
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO KNOW,

38:16.922 --> 38:21.091
WHATEVER YOU MIGHT WANT
TO ASK ME IS FAIR GAME, OK?

38:21.226 --> 38:23.159
WILLIAM: LIKE DISLOCATING
YOUR THUMBS?

38:23.295 --> 38:24.694
'CAUSE I CAN'T BELIEVE
I MISSED THAT.

38:24.830 --> 38:26.730
MAYBE SOMETHING
A LITTLE LESS PAINFUL.

38:26.865 --> 38:30.600
WHAT ABOUT THAT ISLAND
YOU WERE ON?

38:30.736 --> 38:33.937
IT'S LIAN YU.

38:34.072 --> 38:36.873
IT'S MANDARIN
FOR "PURGATORY."

38:38.243 --> 38:40.110
ROY: YOU THINK
THAT'LL BE ENOUGH?

38:40.245 --> 38:42.912
YEAH, WELL, THIS
SHOULD DO THE TRICK.

38:45.517 --> 38:46.983
ROY, THANKS FOR
YOUR HELP, MAN.

38:47.119 --> 38:48.918
IT WAS GOOD
HAVING YOU BACK,
EVEN IF IT WAS

38:49.054 --> 38:50.754
JUST FOR ONE LAST
MISSION.

38:50.889 --> 38:53.890
I THINK I'M GONNA
STICK AROUND FOR A WHILE.

38:54.026 --> 38:56.126
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
TAKING ON A SPACE GOD,

38:56.261 --> 38:58.294
I FIGURE YOU MIGHT NEED
ALL THE HELP YOU CAN GET.

38:58.430 --> 38:59.996
I'M GLAD YOU CHANGED
YOUR MIND.

39:00.132 --> 39:02.565
YOU KNOW, WHEN I
FIRST MET OLIVER,

39:02.701 --> 39:05.502
HE GAVE ME A PURPOSE,

39:05.637 --> 39:08.138
BUT HE ALSO GAVE ME
ALL OF YOU.

39:08.273 --> 39:09.873
IT MAKES SENSE THAT
HAVING A TEAM IS

39:10.008 --> 39:12.375
WHAT HELPS ME IN
THE FUTURE, SO WHY WAIT?

39:12.511 --> 39:17.514
BESIDES, YOU KNOW,
I KIND OF MISS THIS PLACE.

39:19.818 --> 39:21.451
WELCOME BACK, ROY.

39:21.586 --> 39:24.120
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

39:25.757 --> 39:29.325
DON'T FORGET TO SEND ME
THAT PICTURE OF MY DAD
WITH THAT HAIRCUT.

39:29.461 --> 39:31.528
DON'T FORGET TO ASK
ABOUT BRATVA TATTOO.

39:31.663 --> 39:33.029
WE HAVE MATCHING.

39:33.165 --> 39:34.697
OLIVER: USED TO.
USED TO, ACTUALLY.

39:34.866 --> 39:38.134
OH, HO. I'M GONNA NEED TO
HEAR THAT STORY IMMEDIATELY.

39:40.205 --> 39:41.538
THANK YOU.

39:41.673 --> 39:43.239
I ALWAYS SEEM TO END UP
IN YOUR DEBT.

39:43.375 --> 39:45.141
WE ARE BEYOND
KEEPING SCORE.

39:45.277 --> 39:47.811
WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS,
WE HAVE BEEN ENEMIES.

39:47.946 --> 39:49.946
FROM NOW ON, LET US
JUST BE BROTHERS.

39:50.082 --> 39:51.648
NOT THE BRATVA KIND.

39:51.783 --> 39:56.086
NO! REAL FAMILY, LIKE
THE ONE YOU HAVE NOW.

39:56.221 --> 39:59.055
I CAN BE THE FUN UNCLE.

40:00.392 --> 40:03.259
BEING FATHER REALLY
SUITS YOU.

40:03.395 --> 40:06.663
GOOD-BYE, BROTHER.

40:06.798 --> 40:08.932
THANK YOU.
GOOD-BYE, OLIVER.

40:09.067 --> 40:10.900
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

40:13.038 --> 40:15.071
OH, LAUREL, UH...

40:15.207 --> 40:16.773
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SAY.

40:16.908 --> 40:20.743
WHAT? ONE LAST HILARIOUS
RUSSIAN JOKE FOR THE ROAD?

40:20.879 --> 40:23.546
SORRY TO DOUBT YOU.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.849
I GUESS LEOPARDS REALLY
CAN CHANGE SPOTS.

40:25.984 --> 40:28.985
OR IN YOUR CASE,
BIRD, FEATHER.

40:29.121 --> 40:32.188
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
WEREN'T SENTIMENTAL.

40:32.324 --> 40:35.425
MAYBE I CHANGE, TOO,
LIKE YOU.

40:45.670 --> 40:48.304
DID YOU BRING THE PLANS?

40:48.440 --> 40:50.507
ABOUT THAT.

40:50.642 --> 40:52.742
I HAVE DECIDED NOT
TO JOIN YOU

40:52.878 --> 40:54.677
AND YOUR COSMIC
FASHION TRAGEDY

40:54.813 --> 40:56.079
THAT YOU'RE
IN CAHOOTS WITH.

40:56.214 --> 40:58.414
THEN YOU WON'T GET
YOUR EARTH BACK.

40:58.550 --> 41:00.717
IF SAVING IT MEANS
GOING BACK TO THE PERSON
THAT I USED TO BE,

41:00.852 --> 41:03.419
THEN WHAT THE HELL
IS THE POINT?

41:03.555 --> 41:05.655
YOU REALLY HAVE CHANGED.

41:05.790 --> 41:09.692
LOOK, I'M NEW
TO THIS WHOLE DOING
THE RIGHT THING GAME,

41:09.828 --> 41:12.962
BUT YOU SHOULD REALLY TELL
YOUR FAMILY THE TRUTH.

41:13.064 --> 41:14.597
NOT YET.

41:14.733 --> 41:17.834
THEN THIS IS GONNA BE
A LITTLE AWKWARD.

41:24.776 --> 41:26.543
I DIDN'T WANT TO
BELIEVE IT.

41:26.678 --> 41:28.311
I'M SORRY.

41:28.446 --> 41:30.046
[DART GUN FIRES]

41:34.920 --> 41:37.253
LYLA, WHAT--
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
