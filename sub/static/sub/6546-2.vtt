WEBVTT

00:01.836 --> 00:03.701
Nathan: Previously on Haven...
(crackling)

00:03.796 --> 00:05.081
(William screams)
Duke: Jennifer!

00:05.173 --> 00:06.663
Nathan: What happened to
her in the cave?

00:06.757 --> 00:08.008
What's happening to Duke?

00:08.092 --> 00:09.593
(whooshing)

00:09.677 --> 00:11.588
Dwight: Last thing I remember, we were
in the cave underneath the lighthouse.

00:11.679 --> 00:12.668
Duke?

00:12.763 --> 00:13.889
You're causing the Trouble.
How?

00:13.973 --> 00:16.635
Duke: All the Troubles my family
ever wiped out, they're all in me now.

00:16.726 --> 00:17.715
We have to find Mara.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.766
She created the troubles--
she's got to know how to end them.

00:19.854 --> 00:22.436
- Chief, people in the guard
are scared,

00:22.523 --> 00:23.808
and no one's heard
a peep from Vince.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.266
Dave: We should never have
opened that door.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.817
Nathan: She started turning
back into the woman

00:28.905 --> 00:30.236
that William's
been waiting for.

00:30.323 --> 00:32.109
- My name is Mara.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.940
Vince: The Mi'kmaqs speak
of special places

00:34.035 --> 00:36.617
where the veil
between worlds is stretched thin.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.114
Dwight: She called it a thinny.
Couldn't get through,

00:38.206 --> 00:39.241
said it was sealed.

00:39.332 --> 00:41.368
Mara shows up,
she's not Audrey anymore.

00:41.459 --> 00:42.949
She's a killer.
(gun fires)

00:43.044 --> 00:44.955
Mara: We know what you can do.
Nathan: The drawings affect things.

00:45.046 --> 00:46.035
(crashing)

00:47.340 --> 00:48.329
(crashing)

00:49.050 --> 00:51.166
Mara: It's Aether.
William hid it.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.375
That's why I
need to get him back.

00:52.470 --> 00:54.711
Nathan: But I will get Audrey back.
Mara: Audrey's gone.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.182
- Our love is
stronger than anything

00:57.266 --> 00:58.301
that you and--
(gun fires)

00:58.392 --> 01:00.883
J‘J‘

01:03.731 --> 01:07.599
J‘J‘

01:08.486 --> 01:09.692
(car door closes)

01:11.572 --> 01:14.234
- Hey, answer your phone
once in a while.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.403
(sighs)

01:17.536 --> 01:18.867
(sighs)

01:20.164 --> 01:21.153
(sighs)

01:21.249 --> 01:22.864
Dwight's got a couple of cops
over at my spot

01:22.959 --> 01:24.620
looking for Mara.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.246
I got to tell you something.

01:27.255 --> 01:30.497
All the people... getting
their faces sewn shut?

01:32.593 --> 01:33.799
Well, apparently that's me.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.253
- What?

01:37.348 --> 01:39.964
- William told me
that every Trouble in a person

01:40.059 --> 01:42.050
that was killed by a Crocker--

01:43.104 --> 01:44.184
Well, they're all in me now.

01:46.107 --> 01:47.187
It's okay, you know?

01:47.275 --> 01:49.357
l-l-- I'm just gonna stay Zen,

01:49.443 --> 01:50.853
try to keep it in check
till I can figure it out,

01:50.945 --> 01:51.934
which is gonna be impossible

01:52.029 --> 01:53.018
while I'm trying
to find Jennifer,

01:53.114 --> 01:54.524
but...

01:54.615 --> 01:55.604
it's fine.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.951
How was your day?

02:00.454 --> 02:02.445
- She shot me.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.701
(waves lapping)

02:04.792 --> 02:09.035
J‘J‘

02:10.798 --> 02:12.334
(chatter)

02:13.342 --> 02:15.754
- What happens when they buy
the vitamins,

02:15.845 --> 02:18.928
but they don't... feel better?

02:19.015 --> 02:20.755
- 30-day money-back guarantee.

02:20.850 --> 02:22.590
- But nobody actually
does that, right?

02:22.685 --> 02:24.676
People who think
they need vitamins--

02:24.770 --> 02:26.226
they're lazy.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.303
- Okay...

02:27.398 --> 02:29.480
I'll cross you off the list.
Thank you, ma'am.

02:30.526 --> 02:31.857
(string snaps)

02:31.944 --> 02:33.775
Um... That's for everybody.

02:33.863 --> 02:35.353
- Oh, don't worry.

02:35.448 --> 02:36.858
I'll return it.

02:36.949 --> 02:40.988
You know, I absolutely love your...

02:41.078 --> 02:42.067
outfit.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.699
- Yeah, well, you got to go
to Boston to get it--

02:43.789 --> 02:44.778
(squishing)

02:49.128 --> 02:50.117
(crumpling)

02:53.507 --> 02:55.759
Duke: I know you can't feel,
but you were shot in the chest.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.832
You need to get
to a hospital.

02:58.054 --> 03:00.761
- Bullet missed my lungs,
went through-- I'll be okay.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.429
- And you know too much
about getting shot.

03:03.434 --> 03:05.971
- I gotta go.
- Slow down, tiger.

03:06.062 --> 03:07.677
- Remember that black blob
you saw

03:07.772 --> 03:09.512
floating out
of the police station?

03:09.607 --> 03:10.687
Mara called it Aether.

03:10.775 --> 03:12.265
Says there's more of it
hidden in Haven.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.520
William knows where.

03:15.071 --> 03:16.060
- How much of it?

03:16.155 --> 03:17.520
- I don't think we want
to find out.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.325
- Did she say
anything about Jennifer?

03:20.409 --> 03:23.446
- Yeah... said she doesn't
care about her.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.323
That Jennifer
can't close thinnies.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.083
- Where the hell is she?

03:28.167 --> 03:29.828
(waves lapping)

03:30.836 --> 03:32.576
- Hey.

03:32.671 --> 03:33.706
You gonna be okay?

03:34.757 --> 03:35.872
- Yeah.

03:35.966 --> 03:36.955
- You?
- Yeah.

03:39.053 --> 03:41.044
Missed my bones.
I can move.

03:42.098 --> 03:43.258
- That's not what I meant.

03:43.349 --> 03:45.931
Audrey...
She-- she shot you, Nathan.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.176
- Mara shot me,
not Audrey.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.440
(chatter)

04:00.282 --> 04:02.147
-VhHe
- Hi, Audrey.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.232
- Hi.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.990
So you're eating...

04:08.290 --> 04:09.279
That.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.787
- Just means
an extra yoga class.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.208
- Yoga.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.160
That fetid room
full of sweaty bodies?

04:15.256 --> 04:16.917
It's like a camel house
at the zoo.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.213
(laughs)
Listen...

04:18.300 --> 04:19.836
I need you
to draw something.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.133
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.176
- Thought my drawings
were too dangerous.

04:23.264 --> 04:25.676
- No. No.
Only to the clumsy.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.051
You'll be fine.

04:27.143 --> 04:30.681
And I will be right there
to help you.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.979
J‘J‘

04:35.860 --> 04:40.729
J‘J‘

05:07.141 --> 05:09.302
(monitor beeping,
announcements over P.A.)

05:10.644 --> 05:11.804
Vince: I don't know.

05:11.896 --> 05:14.763
I don't know a great deal
about Dave, now.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.438
- Terrible when you
find out people you trust

05:16.525 --> 05:17.731
are keeping secrets.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.392
- What's wrong, Dwight?

05:20.488 --> 05:22.319
- Why didn't you tell me
Mara was responsible

05:22.406 --> 05:23.521
for bringing
the Troubles to Haven?

05:23.616 --> 05:24.605
(sighing)

05:24.700 --> 05:26.941
- Audrey told me
in confidence.

05:27.036 --> 05:28.151
It wasn't my place.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.234
- It's totally your place.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.116
You're the leader of the guard.

05:31.207 --> 05:32.196
Unless you don't trust me.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.247
- Of course I trust you.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.075
You're like a son to me.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.377
- I just didn't want...
- What?

05:38.464 --> 05:40.796
- I didn't want you to
look at Audrey differently.

05:40.883 --> 05:42.965
- Audrey is Mara,
and right now Mara is doing

05:43.052 --> 05:44.633
everything she can to
destroy this place.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.927
- But Audrey and
Lucy and Sarah before her

05:47.014 --> 05:49.255
never wanted anything but
to try and help people.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.466
- You could've--
- It was a judgment call,

05:51.560 --> 05:52.549
and I made it.

05:52.645 --> 05:54.931
J‘J‘

05:55.022 --> 05:56.262
- Colette Barrow
called me.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.689
People having their face
sewn up all over town today--

05:58.776 --> 06:00.562
it's an old Barrow family
Trouble resurrected.

06:00.653 --> 06:01.642
- Colette called you?

06:01.737 --> 06:03.853
- Unfortunately,
Reverend Driscoll's old buddies

06:03.948 --> 06:05.529
figured out that it was
a Barrow Trouble, too.

06:05.616 --> 06:06.947
- What did those goons do?

06:07.034 --> 06:09.525
- They nailed a dead raccoon
to their front door, for now.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.656
Should put some
guard protection on their house.

06:11.747 --> 06:12.987
- Okay.
(sighs)

06:13.082 --> 06:15.698
Why do some people
in this town make things worse?

06:15.793 --> 06:17.454
- Because they're scared

06:17.545 --> 06:19.786
because there's no end in sight
to the Troubles.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.212
(cell phone vibrates)

06:23.300 --> 06:25.461
J‘J‘

06:25.553 --> 06:27.714
- Lady stabbed in the eye
next to the bulletin board.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.671
- Dwight, wait.

06:32.893 --> 06:33.882
- None of them.

06:33.978 --> 06:36.264
- Duke is.
- Duke?

06:36.355 --> 06:38.471
- There's a lot of stuff
going on out there, Vince.

06:38.566 --> 06:41.228
Guard needs a leader.
Now.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.149
woman on P.A.: Dr. Matthews
to cardiology, please.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.943
Dr. Matthews to cardiology.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.528
J‘J‘

06:58.377 --> 06:59.913
Mara: I used to paint.

07:00.004 --> 07:01.665
A lot of people did
before TV.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.744
- You're not that old.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.259
- A lady never tells.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.508
J‘J‘

07:14.435 --> 07:15.595
What's wrong, Vickie?

07:16.604 --> 07:17.593
- This spot...

07:18.606 --> 07:19.595
I never see it change,

07:19.690 --> 07:22.523
but somehow,
I think it keeps changing.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.069
- You have a good eye, Vickie.
That's why you like to draw.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.992
Look at what
your drawings can do.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.286
They're not just drawings.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.034
They can sculpt
your world.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.204
(tearing)

07:46.216 --> 07:48.832
(thunder booms, laughing)

07:54.642 --> 07:57.133
When I return,
you shall be spared my wrath.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.558
Bye, Vickie.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.011
(gasps)

08:01.690 --> 08:02.679
Ugh!

08:04.318 --> 08:05.307
(exasperated breathing)

08:06.820 --> 08:08.811
- Audrey,
are you all right?

08:09.907 --> 08:11.647
Can I help you?

08:11.742 --> 08:13.198
- I'm afraid you can't,
Vickie.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.613
You are an early model.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.116
I need something
with real... oomph.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.375
I need to make a new one.

08:26.215 --> 08:28.080
- A custom order.
- What?

08:28.175 --> 08:30.166
- I really do like you, Vickie.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.092
(zapping, grunting)

08:34.848 --> 08:37.510
Duke: She hasn't called, so I'm thinking
maybe she landed in the water

08:37.601 --> 08:38.807
and it fried her phone,

08:38.894 --> 08:40.930
now she's stuck
on some beach somewhere.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.562
- I look for birds.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.107
- Yes, you-you look for birds.
I get that.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.606
But what I'm asking is,
did you see anything out there?

08:49.697 --> 08:51.107
Lighthouse debris?

08:51.198 --> 08:52.529
- Birds are over the cod.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.776
I fish cod.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.575
- But what I'm asking is--
- I look at the birds.

08:58.831 --> 09:01.038
- I'm not upset at you.

09:01.125 --> 09:03.491
I'm not upset at you.

09:03.585 --> 09:04.665
- Tell the Coasties.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.709
If she's stranded
on some beach somewhere,

09:06.797 --> 09:08.583
they'll find her.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.290
- Right.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.169
That's not a half bad idea.
(phone rings)

09:16.432 --> 09:17.512
Yeah, I need
a coastal search.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.340
Duke Crocker.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.269
No, it is not contraband.
It's a person.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.267
- What's wrong with Audrey?

09:28.193 --> 09:30.479
- That she needed
to make someone with oomph.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.027
Then she told me
she really liked me

09:32.114 --> 09:33.650
and shot me with a Taser.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.106
- She's sick.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.406
Just go get yourself
checked out.

09:36.493 --> 09:37.482
- I'm okay.

09:37.578 --> 09:40.115
I'm going back to work.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.703
My swipe badge
that gets me in the morgue--

09:44.793 --> 09:45.999
Audrey took it.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.748
- I'll send a unit
to pick you up.

09:54.636 --> 09:55.625
- Okay.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.507
(squeaking and rattling)

09:58.599 --> 10:00.009
Oh, God. Rats.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.181
I hate rats.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.429
(shudders)

10:07.941 --> 10:10.102
(squeaking and rattling
continues)

10:11.028 --> 10:14.191
J‘J‘

10:14.281 --> 10:15.270
(clinking)

10:18.786 --> 10:20.447
Why are you doing that?

10:30.339 --> 10:33.957
J‘J‘

10:35.469 --> 10:38.927
J‘J‘

10:39.348 --> 10:40.554
- Gloria?
(cocks gun)

10:42.309 --> 10:44.425
(groaning)

10:54.363 --> 10:55.569
J‘J‘

10:55.656 --> 10:57.567
Yeah, put the shotgun away,
little Joe,

10:57.658 --> 10:59.649
and get me out of here, please.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.074
- Gloria.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.662
(groans)
- Why are you hiding?

11:02.746 --> 11:06.079
- Because your gal pal
came creeping in

11:06.166 --> 11:07.576
with intern's pass,

11:07.668 --> 11:09.408
and it didn't seem kosher.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.709
Now, where's intern?

11:10.796 --> 11:12.502
- Vickie's fine.
Where's M... Audrey?

11:12.589 --> 11:15.797
- Well, ugh, "Audrey" heard you
coming on her radio,

11:15.884 --> 11:17.966
and when she saw you
pulling up with that cannon,

11:18.053 --> 11:19.168
she peaced out.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.503
I bet you
she'll be back, though,

11:20.597 --> 11:23.259
because I got what she
was looking for.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.053
I always wondered
about these little buggers.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.396
Ah-- You want to tell me
what's going on

11:28.480 --> 11:30.471
with Detective Parker?

11:34.778 --> 11:36.279
- Hey, what you doing?

11:36.363 --> 11:38.024
- Using some of my friends
to look for Jennifer.

11:39.867 --> 11:40.947
Just like you're
using your department

11:41.034 --> 11:42.149
to look for her too, right?

11:42.244 --> 11:43.233
- Yes, and more.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.317
Listen,
let's get out to the Barrows,

11:44.413 --> 11:46.074
try and figure out how this
Trouble of theirs,

11:46.164 --> 11:47.665
and now yours, works.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.578
- I'm not going there.
- Duke...

11:50.711 --> 11:53.202
- Look, Troubles happen
when people get upset,

11:53.297 --> 11:55.208
which is what you
are making me right now.

11:55.299 --> 11:57.585
This is my happy place.
I'm staying right here.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.837
- Half an hour ago, an
entire Coast Guard cutter crew

11:59.928 --> 12:01.668
had their eyes sewn shut.

12:01.763 --> 12:02.923
That was you.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.300
Boat hit a bait dock
at 12 knots,

12:04.391 --> 12:06.928
so your happy
place isn't working.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.259
We gotta solve this.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.854
Anyone finds Jennifer,
I'll know.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.812
- I'm back in one hour.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.394
- You can work on
your happy attitude on the way.

12:21.033 --> 12:23.274
- Ah. You're awake.

12:23.869 --> 12:24.858
- Where have you been?

12:24.953 --> 12:28.491
- Getting you
a few of your favorite things.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.994
Bearjerky from Curtis.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.496
Tab. Mmm, mmm.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.750
(cans thump)
And the latest issue

12:36.840 --> 12:39.798
of "Jugs Ahoy."

12:39.885 --> 12:42.171
- I'll take a tab.
I'm so thirsty, Vince.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.798
- Sure. Course.

12:45.515 --> 12:49.599
But... let's talk
about a few things first.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.553
- You can't extort me with soda
and pornography, Vincent.

12:52.648 --> 12:55.230
- Yes, I can.
We both know that.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.690
Now...

12:57.778 --> 13:01.191
you said you've
been there,

13:01.281 --> 13:02.691
to this void.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.867
Elaborate.
(soda cracks open)

13:07.955 --> 13:08.944
(fizzing)

13:15.462 --> 13:16.872
Dave: 1983.

13:18.090 --> 13:21.378
I woke up one night...
on the beach.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.334
First I thought
I was sleepwalking.

13:24.429 --> 13:27.387
Then... I realize I was
being pulled.

13:27.474 --> 13:31.513
Pulled toward an opening
full of that awful green mist.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.689
I went through, Vincent.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.889
J‘J‘

13:36.984 --> 13:38.144
- Through to where?

13:38.235 --> 13:39.645
- I don't know.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.479
I don't remember anything--
nothing of what happened there.

13:44.533 --> 13:47.275
ljust remember waking up

13:47.369 --> 13:48.825
back on that beach...

13:49.830 --> 13:52.196
in terrible pain.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.791
Pain like I have right now.

13:55.961 --> 13:56.950
Look.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.044
I had these same injuries

14:03.135 --> 14:05.751
the last time I came back
from the void.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.588
Something from
the void wants to hurt me,

14:08.682 --> 14:10.468
and I think it came
into the cave.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.557
Dwight: Tell the State
Coastal Commission

14:16.648 --> 14:19.185
the lighthouse failed due
to saltwater corrosion.

14:19.276 --> 14:22.063
- Must be getting hard explaining what's happening
here to the world.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.519
- It's harder explaining it
to the people who live here.

14:24.698 --> 14:25.687
- Oh, boy.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.356
- Damn it.

14:30.996 --> 14:32.611
(dog barks in distance)

14:37.085 --> 14:40.248
J‘J‘

14:45.177 --> 14:46.462
- He's not sewn up.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.963
- No, he's beat up.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.044
- Why?

14:50.348 --> 14:52.088
- I'm gonna ask Vince
the same question.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.017
I need an ambulance.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.811
(tape tearing)
- That means that that brunette FBI agent

14:58.899 --> 15:00.059
who said she was
Audrey Parker,

15:00.150 --> 15:02.562
she's the real,
original Audrey Parker?

15:02.652 --> 15:03.778
- Eh... Probably.

15:04.946 --> 15:05.935
(metal clattering)

15:06.031 --> 15:08.317
- And this Mara woman
or whatever she is,

15:08.408 --> 15:09.818
she's been, what?

15:09.910 --> 15:12.401
Like, wearing our Audrey
as kind of like a disguise

15:12.496 --> 15:13.702
all this time?

15:14.998 --> 15:16.204
- Yeah.

15:18.877 --> 15:19.866
- You know,
I met a guy on Match.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.828
He said he was a
6'1" airline pilot.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.084
He was
a 5'3" mitten salesman.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.677
Anyway, I'm sorry,
Nathan.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.425
- Audrey was so real to me.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.427
- She was real
to me, too.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.354
But Mara is realer.

15:39.856 --> 15:40.845
Glock 9.

15:40.941 --> 15:43.478
- She used my gun
to kill him.

15:43.568 --> 15:44.557
(clanks)

15:44.653 --> 15:45.859
(distant rattling)

15:45.946 --> 15:46.935
Gloria: Oh, incoming.

15:49.658 --> 15:50.647
Thank you...

15:52.619 --> 15:54.155
- What happened?

15:54.246 --> 15:55.827
- Well, it's a weird one, even for Haven.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.621
(pen clicks)
The cops think she was done in by a pencil.

15:58.708 --> 15:59.868
(cell phone chimes)

15:59.960 --> 16:01.450
- Mara did this, too.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.544
- And I got two Coast Guard guys
coming in who didn't make it.

16:06.216 --> 16:08.502
And Vince wants to see me.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.925
I tell ya,
Haven keeps a coroner busy.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.001
I'm interviewing nannies,

16:12.097 --> 16:14.759
so I will be renegotiating
my contract.

16:16.643 --> 16:21.307
J‘J‘

16:24.192 --> 16:26.057
(distant siren blares)

16:33.994 --> 16:34.983
(clattering)

16:43.378 --> 16:46.711
- All units,
if you see Detective Parker,

16:46.798 --> 16:49.460
tell her I have what she was
looking for at the morgue.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.257
She just needs to
find me, and I'll give it to her.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.881
J‘J‘

16:53.972 --> 16:56.054
- The Barrow family is all
gathering in Henry's room.

16:56.141 --> 16:57.130
We're trying to get
an OR. ready,

16:57.225 --> 16:58.761
but it's been a busy day.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.889
- Can I talk to the family?
- You're the boss.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.971
Catch the bastards
who did this.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.106
- We caught a break with
the whole family being here.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.731
Someone might know
how this Trouble works.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.937
- Yeah. You know what?
Give me a sec.

17:12.032 --> 17:13.067
l-l-l'll catch up to you.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.160
(announcements over the P.A.)

17:20.290 --> 17:21.279
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.114
- I wanted to see if maybe
a woman was brought in here.

17:23.752 --> 17:26.289
Black hair, 5'2".
Might have been in an accident.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.789
- Let me check.
- Thank you.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.249
- Might take a minute.
We've been crazed.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.460
But if she came in,
Holly will know.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.969
(muffled screaming)

17:41.311 --> 17:44.724
J‘J‘

17:50.695 --> 17:51.855
- Oh, my God.

17:51.947 --> 17:54.734
(muffled screaming continues)
Oh, God, Holly.

17:54.824 --> 17:55.813
Holly.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.615
J‘J‘

17:57.702 --> 17:58.691
(whispers)
- Help...

17:58.787 --> 17:59.776
(muffled)

17:59.871 --> 18:02.408
J‘J‘

18:04.167 --> 18:07.079
J‘J‘

18:09.256 --> 18:11.212
woman on P.A.: Nurse Gallup, room 312.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.039
Nurse Gallup, room 312.

18:15.262 --> 18:18.504
Colette: I've told
you everything I know.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.338
But my father,
he was a boy

18:20.433 --> 18:22.139
when the sewing
was happening.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.933
He might be able to help you.

18:24.938 --> 18:25.927
Chief.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.350
Papa's... old.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.560
(monitor beeping)

18:33.655 --> 18:34.644
- Mr. Barrow?

18:35.949 --> 18:36.938
- Yes?

18:37.033 --> 18:38.193
- I'm Dwight Hendrickson.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.365
Chief of police in Haven.

18:40.203 --> 18:43.866
- It's nice to meet you,
Mr. Hendrickson.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.993
- We're gonna catch the men
that did this.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.666
But first, I need to talk to
you about your family's Trouble.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.794
The one that sews up
people's eyes and mouths.

18:52.549 --> 18:53.834
Your daughter Colette,
she told me

18:53.925 --> 18:55.301
that you might
be able to help me

18:55.385 --> 18:56.545
figure out what
triggered this.

18:57.470 --> 19:01.304
- Lettie has
a wonderful imagination.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.052
When she was six,

19:03.143 --> 19:07.182
she used the rose garden
on our east knoll

19:07.272 --> 19:10.014
to build
an entire make-believe city.

19:10.108 --> 19:13.566
Homes, schools, roads,

19:13.653 --> 19:15.154
a dance studio.

19:15.238 --> 19:16.478
- Mr. Barrow...
(sighs)

19:16.573 --> 19:19.565
the Troubles are
activated by an emotional state.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.865
Was anything happening
back then?

19:20.952 --> 19:23.409
- Her village even included a--

19:23.496 --> 19:25.077
a r-a river.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.747
She used
the garden hose to make it.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.335
- Dad.
- Yeah?

19:29.419 --> 19:33.128
- Can you help him?
It's important.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.752
- When I was 12 years old,

19:40.847 --> 19:45.591
I had sailing lessons
every Sunday.

19:46.811 --> 19:49.143
I didn't know
we had no money.

19:50.106 --> 19:53.894
Then the sailing instructor
stopped getting paid.

19:53.985 --> 19:57.694
He came by to
tell me we were broke.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.355
But...

20:00.867 --> 20:01.856
(shudders)

20:02.869 --> 20:07.784
His mouth was... sewn shut

20:07.874 --> 20:09.614
before he could say
anything.

20:10.627 --> 20:11.616
- Sewn shut by what?

20:12.504 --> 20:16.588
- We had
three stuffed monkeys:

20:16.674 --> 20:21.794
See No Evil, Hear No Evil,
and Speak No Evil.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.549
- I saw them on your mantle,

20:23.640 --> 20:25.380
with the same stitches
as the victims.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.345
- Somehow...

20:28.436 --> 20:29.425
they-they were...

20:30.563 --> 20:31.552
active.

20:32.774 --> 20:37.393
Back then, if you didn't
have good news for a Barrow...

20:40.907 --> 20:44.070
best not say anything
at all.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.661
- And if someone did?

20:47.330 --> 20:48.490
- They were sewn.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.617
(crying)

20:50.708 --> 20:52.539
(approaching footsteps,
announcements on the P.A.)

20:57.924 --> 20:59.130
- Nurse Holly's resting, but...

21:00.260 --> 21:01.420
after that, some nurses
are talking

21:01.511 --> 21:02.967
about leaving the hospital.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.169
- We need them here.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.754
- Are they any good
blind or dead?

21:05.849 --> 21:07.055
We need help.

21:07.142 --> 21:08.598
- I can get
emergency volunteers.

21:08.685 --> 21:09.891
- I'm talking
about the Guard.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.640
Our Guard. Where are they?
Where's Vince?

21:12.730 --> 21:14.345
We need the Troubles to end.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.931
- I'll talk to him.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.014
- Wait...

21:17.110 --> 21:19.192
Your friend asked
about a dark-haired woman.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.155
We got a D.O.A. An hour ago,

21:21.239 --> 21:23.605
found her washed up
on Eatons Neck.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.815
- Got a name?

21:24.909 --> 21:26.410
- Jane Doe.
No I.D.

21:29.164 --> 21:30.153
(creaking)

21:30.248 --> 21:33.536
J‘J‘

21:37.755 --> 21:39.086
(zipper unzipping)

21:43.761 --> 21:45.217
(sighs)

21:48.808 --> 21:49.968
- You knew her?

21:54.814 --> 21:55.803
Jennifer Mason.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.222
How long has she been dead?

21:59.110 --> 22:00.099
- A while.

22:00.945 --> 22:03.061
Paramedic said no fluid
in her lungs.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.942
She was dead
before she hit the water.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.400
- These are Dave's?
- Yes.

22:09.621 --> 22:10.610
- Jeez.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.240
The bruising is extensive,

22:12.332 --> 22:13.993
and the ligament damage
is severe.

22:14.083 --> 22:17.211
I mean, it almost looks like
he was twisted into pieces.

22:17.295 --> 22:19.752
- Who did this?
- I don't know.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.330
- So whoever did this could be
walking around town right now?

22:22.425 --> 22:24.086
- I don't know.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.883
- Well, I suggest
you find out.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.302
I'm not night
fishing until you do.

22:28.431 --> 22:29.420
EH31]

22:35.813 --> 22:40.432
J‘J‘

22:43.863 --> 22:46.275
- So what do you think?

22:50.036 --> 22:51.367
- It's a start.

22:51.454 --> 22:52.443
(laughs)

22:53.540 --> 22:55.781
- Oh, that's high praise
from a Wuornos.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.708
(cell phone ringing)

23:07.011 --> 23:08.000
- Yeah?

23:08.096 --> 23:09.757
- I got your message.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.008
You have my Aether
from the morgue?

23:12.100 --> 23:13.089
- Yeah.

23:13.184 --> 23:15.140
- I want you to leave it at--
- No.

23:15.228 --> 23:17.219
I'm going to give
it to you face-to-face.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.473
- First of all,

23:18.565 --> 23:20.101
what makes you think
that I'm dumb enough

23:20.191 --> 23:22.477
to go where you would
pull a gun on me?

23:22.569 --> 23:26.938
And second, come on,
haven't you suffered enough?

23:27.031 --> 23:28.020
Every time you see me,

23:28.116 --> 23:30.778
you look like
you're going to cry.

23:30.868 --> 23:32.779
Even when I don't
shootyou.

23:32.870 --> 23:35.998
- I need to make sure you use it
to leave Haven forever.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.822
- Hmm, no.
Not going to do that.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.249
- I am gonna give you
one of those little black blobs.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.122
One--
use it for anything

23:42.213 --> 23:45.705
other than opening a thin spot
and leaving,

23:45.800 --> 23:48.337
and you will be
stuck here with nothing.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.419
I am letting you leave alive.

23:52.223 --> 23:53.303
I'm not gonna do it again.

23:54.809 --> 23:56.345
- Wow....

23:56.436 --> 23:58.097
Look who grew a spine.

24:00.106 --> 24:03.269
Okay, I can do this if I
Trouble someone,

24:03.359 --> 24:04.610
and I think
it should be you.

24:07.405 --> 24:08.394
- Fine.

24:09.532 --> 24:11.033
- I'm a little surprised.

24:11.159 --> 24:12.899
You're gonna let
Audrey go?

24:12.994 --> 24:14.700
- You're not Audrey.

24:14.787 --> 24:18.029
You're just
a pathetic, evil reminder

24:18.124 --> 24:19.284
of what I lost.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.620
What we all lost.

24:23.755 --> 24:25.711
- Meet me in an hour
at the same thinny

24:25.798 --> 24:27.049
I tried with Vickie.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.373
She knows where it is.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.004
And you may want
to wear a helmet.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.551
I know you can't feel,
but trust me,

24:32.639 --> 24:33.845
this will be...

24:35.183 --> 24:36.298
Unpleasant.

24:39.729 --> 24:41.640
(chatter)

24:44.609 --> 24:46.395
J‘J‘

24:46.486 --> 24:48.397
- That's all of it?
- Yeah.

24:48.488 --> 24:49.568
What are you looking for?

24:49.656 --> 24:51.487
It's just, I could get
in trouble for this.

24:51.574 --> 24:52.939
I kind of want to
know why I'm doing it.

24:53.034 --> 24:54.240
I hear whispers
about Audrey--

24:54.327 --> 24:56.238
- You're doing it
for the Guard.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.819
That's all you need to know.

24:59.582 --> 25:00.947
Dwight: Tell Nathan
I want to see him.

25:01.042 --> 25:02.703
Vince, we need to talk.

25:02.794 --> 25:05.160
- Actually, I was just leaving.
- No, you're not.

25:05.254 --> 25:06.243
Larry: Chief.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.675
- What are you doing here?

25:12.011 --> 25:13.626
- He asked for the dash cam
footage from your car

25:13.721 --> 25:14.927
when the lighthouse collapsed.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.003
He's the head of the Guard,

25:16.099 --> 25:17.259
so I figured
I'd give it to him.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.510
But now I'm not so sure
I did the right thing.

25:19.811 --> 25:21.347
Sorry, chief.
You can take it back if you want.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.605
- Dave thinks there was
someone else in the lighthouse.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.479
Maybe your dashboard camera
caught something.

25:28.569 --> 25:30.651
- My office.
Now.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.021
(sighs)

25:36.119 --> 25:37.609
Dwight, I'm very busy.

25:37.912 --> 25:40.324
- Colette BarroW's son, Henry,
he's in the hospital.

25:40.415 --> 25:41.780
- Is he okay?
What happened?

25:41.874 --> 25:43.125
- You didn't send protection
to the Barrows'

25:43.209 --> 25:45.074
like we agreed,
and he gotjumped.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.545
(sighs)
- Damn.

25:47.547 --> 25:48.627
I got distracted.

25:48.715 --> 25:49.875
- Right, by Dave.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.550
- Yes, distracted by Dave.

25:52.260 --> 25:53.921
Do you think
what I do is easy?

25:54.011 --> 25:55.626
- No, Vince. I think leading
the Guard's hard.

25:55.722 --> 25:56.882
I think it needs
your full attention.

25:56.973 --> 25:57.962
- It's getting it.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.139
Look, don't you see, Dave,

26:00.226 --> 26:01.841
the void,
the Troubles,

26:01.936 --> 26:03.096
they could be connected.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.223
- Or you could just be
protecting your brother.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.056
- You think I'm ignoring my
duties to the Guard

26:08.151 --> 26:09.140
to protect Dave?

26:09.235 --> 26:10.270
- Honestly, I don't know
what you're doing.

26:10.361 --> 26:11.862
l-l wish I knew.

26:11.946 --> 26:13.231
I know why you keep
Haven's secrets

26:13.322 --> 26:14.482
from the rest of the world,

26:14.574 --> 26:15.859
but why do you keep them
from the Guard?

26:15.950 --> 26:17.190
Why do you
keep them from me?

26:17.285 --> 26:19.276
- I don't keep secrets
from you.

26:20.455 --> 26:22.912
- Did you tell me that Audrey
brought the Troubles to Haven?

26:22.999 --> 26:24.660
(sighs)
She's not Audrey.

26:24.751 --> 26:27.367
She's Mara, the bitch who
brought all this misery here.

26:27.462 --> 26:28.622
Did you ever stop
to think of that?

26:28.713 --> 26:31.204
Or is protecting the memory
of Audrey more important to you?

26:31.299 --> 26:32.630
- Don'tjudge me, Dwight.

26:32.717 --> 26:35.675
- No, Vince, you need it.
You, Nathan, even Duke.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.218
You're letting your affection
for Audrey

26:37.305 --> 26:38.841
hurt everyone else in this town.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.432
We shouldn't protect her.

26:40.516 --> 26:41.847
We should hunt her down,
tie her up,

26:41.934 --> 26:43.515
and make her undo
everything she's done.

26:46.481 --> 26:47.561
- You wanted to see me.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.515
- Yeah.

27:00.077 --> 27:01.066
(door closes)

27:05.541 --> 27:06.872
Jennifer's dead.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.950
She washed up on
Eatons Neck.

27:13.633 --> 27:17.342
J‘J‘

27:20.139 --> 27:21.254
- Does Duke know?
- Good question.

27:21.349 --> 27:22.839
(sighing)

27:22.934 --> 27:24.174
The BarroW's Trouble
that he revived

27:24.268 --> 27:25.769
is triggered by denial.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.011
- The Coast Guard,
the nurse--

27:28.105 --> 27:29.140
Duke is sewing up anyone

27:29.315 --> 27:30.555
who could tell him
that Jennifer's dead.

27:30.650 --> 27:31.685
- He would have got me
too if he knew

27:31.776 --> 27:32.891
I covered the waterfront.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.851
I got to tell him
the truth.

27:35.947 --> 27:38.233
- How do you know he's not
gonna sew you up when you try?

27:38.324 --> 27:39.484
- I don't know, Nathan,
but I'm chief of police.

27:39.575 --> 27:40.564
I got to do something.

27:40.660 --> 27:41.649
- Dwight,

27:42.662 --> 27:43.902
I've known Duke
since we were kids.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.497
Let me tell him.

27:45.581 --> 27:46.661
- You have to go now.

27:46.749 --> 27:48.455
I'm gonna go find the guys
who beat up Henry Barrow.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.369
- Dwight...

27:54.173 --> 27:55.754
I heard what you said
about Mara.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.048
- I meant it.

27:57.677 --> 27:58.666
- I know.

27:59.887 --> 28:04.881
l was gonna send Mara back
to whatever Hell she comes from,

28:04.976 --> 28:06.432
but maybe you're right.

28:06.519 --> 28:08.134
Maybe she can fix all this.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.098
So when I'm done with Duke,

28:10.189 --> 28:12.521
I am gonna get her
and bring her to you.

28:12.608 --> 28:13.814
- You know I'm gonna
involve the Guard.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.190
- You do what you have to.
Let's just end this.

28:23.870 --> 28:24.859
(Duke sighs)

28:26.414 --> 28:27.403
Hey.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.196
(waves lapping)

28:30.501 --> 28:31.786
(sighs)

28:31.878 --> 28:33.834
-You know, this town could use
a search-and-rescue plane.

28:35.172 --> 28:39.040
- You find Mara?
- Soon.

28:43.264 --> 28:45.050
You're waiting
for Jennifer here, aren't you?

28:46.392 --> 28:50.180
Because this is your
"in case of emergency" meeting spot.

28:50.271 --> 28:51.260
(knowing chuckle)

28:52.148 --> 28:53.354
- Yeah, well, you know,
it's a good thing to have

28:53.441 --> 28:54.977
in a town like Haven,

28:55.067 --> 28:57.604
you know, when Godzilla
or Mothra attack.

29:01.532 --> 29:02.521
- Yeah.

29:06.203 --> 29:07.943
I've seen you two
hang out here.

29:08.956 --> 29:11.914
J‘J‘

29:12.001 --> 29:13.457
- You ever play Pooh sticks?

29:17.048 --> 29:18.208
- Pooh sticks?

29:18.299 --> 29:19.914
- It's from Winnie the Pooh.
- Ah.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.175
It's a game.
Jennifer taught me how to play.

29:23.262 --> 29:28.427
You know, you take... two twigs, and
you... you race them in the water.

29:28.517 --> 29:30.223
She was beating me,
like, 155 to 90,

29:30.311 --> 29:33.769
but I'm pretty sure
she cheats, so, you know...

29:34.690 --> 29:35.725
- You're a fancy date.

29:35.816 --> 29:38.193
- That's the thing, though.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.360
We can have fun in a box.
It doesn't matter.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.529
When she gets back,
I'm pretty sure Jennifer's gonna need

29:44.617 --> 29:46.653
some fancy hotel time.

29:46.744 --> 29:49.201
Got our bags packed
for Boston already.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.501
- I don't think
she's coming back.

29:59.882 --> 30:01.873
(scoffs)

30:03.636 --> 30:05.422
What's that
supposed to mean?

30:06.806 --> 30:08.967
- You know what I mean.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.013
- No..-

30:13.104 --> 30:15.971
J‘J‘

30:16.065 --> 30:18.852
- We both saw her in that cave.
- No.

30:19.568 --> 30:21.069
- Duke, we saw her.

30:22.196 --> 30:23.697
(squishing)
Duke, look at me.

30:24.865 --> 30:26.071
Look at me!

30:27.743 --> 30:29.244
You're denying the truth.

30:30.830 --> 30:32.821
Jennifer stopped breathing
in the cave.

30:32.915 --> 30:34.121
I heard you say it.

30:34.208 --> 30:35.197
(squishing)

30:38.004 --> 30:40.416
Hey, you can sew
my eyes and ears shut.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.589
- Nathan, stop.
- You have to listen to me.

30:43.676 --> 30:45.132
I have to get you
to understand

30:45.219 --> 30:46.425
that Jennifer is gone.

30:46.512 --> 30:47.501
She's gone.

30:47.847 --> 30:48.927
Dwight saw her body--

30:49.015 --> 30:50.004
- Shut up!

30:50.182 --> 30:52.468
(muffled screaming)

30:54.770 --> 30:55.759
- Nathan.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.720
(muffles screaming continues)

31:02.653 --> 31:03.642
(muffled screaming)

31:05.531 --> 31:06.941
(whispers)
- Nathan.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.022
J‘J‘

31:08.868 --> 31:10.358
Hey, come on.
Breathe.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.286
Who the hell are you?

31:14.373 --> 31:16.534
- Jennifer.
Jennifer Mason.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.786
You're the one
who keeps saying I'm not crazy.

31:21.881 --> 31:22.870
I'm Troubled.

31:24.258 --> 31:25.373
You're gonna be with me,
right?

31:28.679 --> 31:29.839
- The whole time.

31:29.930 --> 31:34.094
J‘J‘

31:40.399 --> 31:43.641
- You kissed me.
- You kissed me back.

31:43.736 --> 31:46.478
After this... you and me,
we will still be okay.

31:50.076 --> 31:53.443
She's not breathing.
Come on, Jennifer.

31:53.537 --> 31:57.906
J‘J‘

32:13.224 --> 32:15.636
(gasping)

32:31.075 --> 32:33.157
I'm the one
who brought... Jennifer to Haven.

32:34.161 --> 32:35.150
- No.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.661
Jennifer was always coming.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.126
She was special.

32:43.003 --> 32:44.459
You know that, right?

32:45.756 --> 32:46.745
- Yeah.

32:48.634 --> 32:49.794
- Yeah, I know.

32:50.803 --> 32:51.792
It's hard.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.008
But Jennifer died
saving us.

32:56.851 --> 32:58.967
I'm not gonna
let that be in vain.

33:01.647 --> 33:02.932
- Yeah?
HoW's that?

33:04.942 --> 33:07.729
- I'm gonna give Mara
to the guard.

33:08.195 --> 33:10.151
Let 'em see if they
can get her to end all this.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.990
Mara started the Troubles.
Maybe she can stop them.

33:35.681 --> 33:36.887
(engines shuts off)

33:40.561 --> 33:44.019
J‘J‘

33:44.106 --> 33:45.687
m

33:47.693 --> 33:48.899
Mara, I'm here.

33:50.863 --> 33:51.852
Mara: Freeze.
(gun cocks)

33:52.948 --> 33:54.199
Slowly take off
your shirt.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.196
- I'm unarmed.

34:02.958 --> 34:03.947
- I know.

34:04.043 --> 34:05.829
I just like the beefcake.

34:06.587 --> 34:08.578
Put your hands
on your head.

34:09.173 --> 34:11.960
If you can.

34:17.640 --> 34:20.006
Front right pocket.

34:24.396 --> 34:27.058
- One?
- That was our deal.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.222
(POPS)

34:30.402 --> 34:33.314
- You know, I'm surprised
you're kicking me out.

34:35.032 --> 34:36.147
You're letting Audrey go.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.865
- Audrey is gone.
(laughs)

34:38.953 --> 34:39.942
- Yeah.
(laughs harder)

34:40.746 --> 34:41.735
I know.

34:43.082 --> 34:45.073
I wasn't gonna
leave Haven anyway.

34:46.794 --> 34:48.534
William and I still have
work to do.

34:48.629 --> 34:49.835
- We had a deal.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.332
(chuckles)
- We did.

34:51.423 --> 34:54.256
But suppose you
had a deal with a weed.

34:54.343 --> 34:55.708
You mightjust
break it, right?

34:55.803 --> 34:57.589
- Why are you doing this?

34:58.430 --> 35:00.341
- I can't leave Haven.

35:00.432 --> 35:03.674
- William and I are not done.
- Done? Done what?

35:03.769 --> 35:04.975
- Done perfecting your gifts.

35:05.062 --> 35:07.428
Now stop,
or I'll shoot you.

35:08.565 --> 35:09.771
Dead this time.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.858
and turn you into a
battering ram.

35:16.949 --> 35:18.314
You'll morph your body,

35:18.409 --> 35:21.025
and you'll burn like
phosphorous or freeze like ice--

35:21.120 --> 35:23.327
anything to break through
that thinny.

35:23.414 --> 35:24.699
And I would say
that it would hurt,

35:24.790 --> 35:27.748
but with you it won't.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.746
I just hope that you make it
through before you croak.

35:31.005 --> 35:31.994
(slight thumping)

35:35.009 --> 35:35.998
(thuds)

35:36.093 --> 35:38.425
J‘J‘

35:38.512 --> 35:39.501
- Bitch!

35:41.807 --> 35:44.514
Well, you're disappointing.

35:46.020 --> 35:47.009
(grunts)

35:47.980 --> 35:48.969
(thuds)

35:51.567 --> 35:52.556
(door slams, Vickie gasps)

35:53.152 --> 35:54.642
- Mara, leave her alone.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.321
- This was your plan?

35:57.948 --> 35:59.154
At least
you're not stupid enough

35:59.241 --> 36:00.902
to think that I would
actually leave.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.403
- You should stop.
You know how this works.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.611
- You forgot.
It doesn't work on me,

36:05.706 --> 36:08.243
because I'm immune
to the Troubles.

36:08.334 --> 36:09.323
- Yeah.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.455
But not to our world.

36:12.546 --> 36:13.535
(gasps)

36:13.630 --> 36:14.881
(cracking, grunts)

36:21.013 --> 36:22.002
(clicking)

36:23.349 --> 36:24.885
(whooshing)

36:31.273 --> 36:35.186
J‘J‘

36:54.713 --> 36:56.419
J‘J‘

36:56.507 --> 36:58.293
- Take a look at this.

36:58.384 --> 37:01.251
There we are all walking
into the lighthouse.

37:01.345 --> 37:02.710
Now look at the timecode.

37:03.097 --> 37:04.462
Dave: 11 :21 am.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.423
- And this is
where the lighthouse collapses.

37:09.895 --> 37:10.884
(soft rumbling)

37:11.730 --> 37:13.595
- 12:19 pm.
- Uh-huh.

37:14.650 --> 37:17.813
Do you remember
the noon whistle sounding?

37:17.903 --> 37:20.064
You can hear it from
all over town.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.737
- No, but we
had a lot going on.

37:22.825 --> 37:25.157
- The whistle was upstairs
in the lighthouse.

37:26.370 --> 37:27.826
It should have
been deafening.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.414
- What are you saying?

37:29.498 --> 37:31.534
(sighs)
- Well, I only remember

37:31.625 --> 37:35.334
being in the cave five minutes,
ten at the most.

37:35.421 --> 37:36.581
But according to the tape...

37:37.673 --> 37:40.836
we were all in there
for almost an hour.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.462
J‘J‘

37:42.553 --> 37:43.542
(footsteps approaching)

37:44.763 --> 37:47.846
- Doctors finished their surgery
on my son Henry.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.594
He may never walk again.

37:49.685 --> 37:52.518
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Colette.

37:52.604 --> 37:55.596
- I heard that you were told
he needed protection.

37:55.691 --> 37:56.897
Is that true?

37:57.901 --> 37:59.061
Is it true?

38:02.281 --> 38:03.521
- Yes, it is.

38:03.615 --> 38:04.604
(smacks, gasps)

38:05.284 --> 38:07.115
- God damn you.

38:10.122 --> 38:12.829
- Nathan called.
He and Vickie captured Mara.

38:12.916 --> 38:13.905
Vickie's on her way
to the hospital.

38:14.001 --> 38:16.162
Nathan's waiting
for me out on route 62

38:16.253 --> 38:17.743
with Mara in cuffs.

38:17.838 --> 38:19.203
- Is she all right?
- Who cares if she's--

38:19.298 --> 38:20.287
- We do, Larry.

38:20.382 --> 38:21.622
We need to get information
out of her.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.591
I told them Mara
is responsible for the Troubles.

38:25.679 --> 38:27.044
They need to know what
they're up against.

38:27.139 --> 38:29.505
- That was imprudent.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.181
Have Nathan bring her
to the Herald.

38:31.268 --> 38:32.383
- I think that's a bad idea.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.810
- I appreciate your input,
Dwight.

38:34.897 --> 38:36.933
Bring her to the Herald.

38:37.024 --> 38:38.059
- We like Dwight's plan.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.726
- Really?
Is that so?

38:41.820 --> 38:43.560
Well, listening to Dwight on this--

38:43.655 --> 38:45.987
- We're notjust listening
to Dwight on this.

38:46.074 --> 38:47.359
Dwight helps us.

38:47.451 --> 38:49.692
Dwight caught the guys
who beat up Henry Barrow.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.573
We're listening to Dwight
from now on.

38:52.664 --> 38:53.653
All of us.

38:55.042 --> 38:56.623
- You want this?

38:56.710 --> 38:57.699
- Yes.

38:59.421 --> 39:02.413
- I was born with this symbol
on my arm.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.669
- And I chose
to put it on me.

39:05.677 --> 39:09.465
J‘J‘

39:15.646 --> 39:16.761
- Okay.

39:23.946 --> 39:25.436
- Go meet Nathan
on route 62.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.692
Get Mara. Take her
to the abandoned cannery.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.398
We need a private place
to work.

39:32.371 --> 39:33.861
I like you, Vince.

39:33.997 --> 39:37.034
I've always liked you.
So work on Dave.

39:38.669 --> 39:40.125
And don't get in my way.

39:40.212 --> 39:44.046
J‘J‘

39:44.132 --> 39:45.633
(waves lapping, bird calling)

39:54.142 --> 39:55.552
- How you holding up?

39:58.564 --> 39:59.553
- I'm sad.

40:00.983 --> 40:01.972
- Yeah.

40:02.901 --> 40:03.890
I called around.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.315
Jennifer really doesn't have
any next of kin.

40:07.406 --> 40:08.612
- I knew that.

40:10.867 --> 40:14.109
- And the state requires that
I bury her in a Potter's field.

40:15.664 --> 40:16.744
- No.

40:16.832 --> 40:18.288
- Course not.

40:18.375 --> 40:19.410
Um...

40:19.501 --> 40:21.833
Do you want to handle it
yourself?

40:21.920 --> 40:22.909
Say good-bye?

40:24.464 --> 40:25.670
- Thank you.

40:25.757 --> 40:29.090
- Okay. Come by the morgue
and get her.

40:29.177 --> 40:31.509
Just don't get me
into trouble, okay?

40:31.722 --> 40:33.087
- I won't.

40:36.351 --> 40:39.263
You know, Jennifer used to complain
about the Cape Rouge a lot.

40:42.232 --> 40:44.188
But she loved the sea.

40:44.276 --> 40:46.187
It was new to her.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.441
We talked
about going to sea a lot.

40:53.243 --> 40:54.744
I'm gonna take her there now.

40:57.456 --> 40:58.946
- That sounds perfect, Duke.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.620
- I really am
gonna miss her.

41:03.629 --> 41:04.618
- I know.

41:05.464 --> 41:07.455
I miss my son.

41:12.095 --> 41:15.178
J‘J‘

41:15.265 --> 41:16.641
(cell phone vibrates)

41:30.739 --> 41:32.980
(birds chirping)

41:33.075 --> 41:34.611
- Good-bye, Parker.

41:43.877 --> 41:46.118
J‘J‘

41:46.213 --> 41:47.202
(gasps)

41:48.173 --> 41:49.162
Nathan.

41:49.758 --> 41:51.089
- Audrey.
- Yes.

41:51.176 --> 41:52.632
I'm still here.

41:52.719 --> 41:53.708
But...

41:54.888 --> 41:55.877
It feels--

41:56.223 --> 41:58.214
it feels like
she's crush...

41:58.308 --> 41:59.514
she's crushing me.

42:00.852 --> 42:01.841
Please, I'm--

42:02.646 --> 42:03.635
I'm still--

42:05.148 --> 42:06.183
I'm still here.

42:07.192 --> 42:08.181
I'm still--

42:08.694 --> 42:09.683
(groans)

42:10.487 --> 42:13.854
Why are you so close to me,
you perv?

42:13.949 --> 42:17.237
You are making
a huge mistake.

42:20.122 --> 42:21.111
- Maybe.

42:22.791 --> 42:23.951
Mara: Hey!

42:24.042 --> 42:26.454
You don't know
what you're messing with.

42:26.545 --> 42:27.534
Get me out of here!

42:29.047 --> 42:30.457
Let me go!

42:30.549 --> 42:31.880
(engine starts)

42:32.634 --> 42:33.623
Let me out!

42:34.553 --> 42:36.544
Hey! Hey!

42:39.224 --> 42:41.089
J‘J‘

42:43.478 --> 42:47.938
J‘J‘
