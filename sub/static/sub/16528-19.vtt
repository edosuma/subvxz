WEBVTT

00:00.735 --> 00:02.101
ADULT ADAM:<i> Ah, school dances.</i>

00:02.103 --> 00:03.936
<i> Back in the day,</i>
<i> nothing was better</i>

00:03.938 --> 00:06.939
<i> than dressing up</i>
<i> and getting down</i>
<i> with all your friends.</i>

00:06.941 --> 00:08.107
<i> And the king of them all</i>
<i> was prom,</i>

00:08.109 --> 00:11.043
<i> a magical night</i>
<i> everyone wanted</i>
<i> to remember forever,</i>

00:11.045 --> 00:15.047
<i> but no one wanted to make it</i>
<i> last more than my big bro.</i>

00:15.049 --> 00:15.714
Hello, Father.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.183
I come to you today
with a life-and-death request.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.085
Why do you look like
a department-store pianist?

00:20.087 --> 00:22.321
You're a department-store
pianist!

00:22.323 --> 00:24.857
No! Sorry.
Let me start over.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.392
As you know,
next weekend is prom.

00:26.394 --> 00:29.628
It is literally guaranteed
to be a night to remember.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.765
That's the theme,
and I take it very seriously.

00:32.767 --> 00:34.900
That's why you will
fully fund this venture.

00:34.902 --> 00:38.070
Go away.
But you have yet to hear
the extraordinary details.

00:38.072 --> 00:42.674
Me and Lainey begin the night
crossing the Delaware River
on a hot-air balloon.

00:42.676 --> 00:45.544
Go.
Upon landing,
12 Clydesdales

00:45.546 --> 00:47.613
will pull our bejeweled
carriage to school

00:47.615 --> 00:49.148
on a path of freshly
cut white roses.

00:49.150 --> 00:52.117
Get out of my face.
Tiki torches
will light the way,

00:52.119 --> 00:54.887
as 100 bald eagles
soar into the sky,

00:54.889 --> 00:57.589
each carrying a poem
handwritten by a haiku expert.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.826
I'm begging you.
That's when El DeBarge
serenades us

01:00.828 --> 01:02.995
as we destroy the dance floor
with our love.

01:02.997 --> 01:04.596
I'm not paying
for an El DeBarge.

01:04.598 --> 01:07.866
This all can come true
for a measly $22,000.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.903
You are an insane person.
You're not getting a penny.

01:10.905 --> 01:14.440
Mom! Dad isn't financially
supporting my prom dream!

01:14.442 --> 01:16.341
Murray, give my baby
money for the prom.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.444
We need a new roof,
not to balloon him to prom.

01:18.446 --> 01:22.147
Lainey's graduating,
and we don't have that
much time together.

01:22.149 --> 01:23.382
I have to make this
extra-special.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.284
I can't believe
my babies are growing up.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.886
One's graduating,
the other's going to prom.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.355
Thank God I still have Adam
to focus everything on.

01:30.357 --> 01:33.092
Wait. What?
Don't worry, pickle.
It'll be wonderful.

01:33.094 --> 01:34.393
We'll be together
morning, noon, and night.

01:34.395 --> 01:37.696
(GASPS) Barry, please!
Take me with you
in the hot-air balloon!

01:37.698 --> 01:40.232
No way, bro.
It only seats three.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.767
And I have a call in
to Yo-Yo Ma

01:41.769 --> 01:44.436
to do amazing yo-yo tricks
as we fly over the city.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.138
I'll give you 80 bucks.
Deal!

01:46.140 --> 01:49.274
Only one thing left to do...
Ask Lainey.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.543
And I know the perfect
way to do it.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.045
(ALARM RINGING)

01:53.047 --> 01:53.912
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:53.914 --> 01:57.182
Lainey Lewis,
will you go to prom with me?

01:57.184 --> 01:59.551
Oh, God.
What did you do?
What any man would...

01:59.553 --> 02:01.854
Show a terrified school
how much I love you.

02:01.856 --> 02:02.988
There's no fire,
is there, Goldberg?

02:02.990 --> 02:06.391
Only the one
burning in my heart for
this sweet lady right here.

02:06.393 --> 02:09.128
Damn it. All right,
everybody back to class!

02:09.130 --> 02:09.862
I hope you brought
your wallet,

02:09.864 --> 02:13.065
because the fire department
charges 80 bucks
for false alarms.

02:13.067 --> 02:16.568
No problem! I happen to have
that exact amount right...

02:16.570 --> 02:18.504
(GASPS) Oh, no!

02:20.007 --> 02:21.206
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:21.208 --> 02:25.410
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:27.715 --> 02:28.614
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:28.616 --> 02:32.784
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:32.786 --> 02:34.920
ADULT ADAM:<i> It was</i>
<i> prom season, 1980-something,</i>

02:34.922 --> 02:36.922
<i> and I was doing</i>
<i> what every other kid was...</i>

02:36.924 --> 02:39.324
<i> Hanging up signs</i>
<i> for my missing cape.</i>

02:39.326 --> 02:42.327
If my cape went missing,
I would need answers, too.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.462
Wait.
You're into theater?

02:43.464 --> 02:44.830
Why haven't I seen you
in drama club?

02:44.832 --> 02:46.298
I go to theater camp
during the summer.

02:46.300 --> 02:50.035
Your dad will pay money
for that? Whoa.

02:50.171 --> 02:52.671
Whoa again! You're starting
a sci-fi magazine?

02:52.673 --> 02:55.607
My mom said
I have to pad out
my college resume.

02:55.609 --> 02:56.975
I also love sci-fi!

02:56.977 --> 02:59.878
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I'm getting too excited.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.046
Deep breath.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.381
Jackie.
I'm Adam.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.816
If you're interested,
you should write something.

03:04.818 --> 03:05.417
Interested?

03:05.419 --> 03:07.686
Let's just say
it's my cup of bantha milk.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.922
Wow. I see The Force
is strong with you.

03:09.924 --> 03:14.259
That deep<i> Star Wars</i> pull
didn't confuse
and alienate you?

03:14.261 --> 03:15.027
Amazing.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.461
ADULT ADAM:<i> It really was.</i>

03:16.463 --> 03:17.362
<i> Nowadays,</i>
<i> it's cool to geek out,</i>

03:17.364 --> 03:21.667
<i> but back then, lady nerds were</i>
<i> extremely rare in my town.</i>

03:21.669 --> 03:23.135
I'm thinking
for our first issue

03:23.137 --> 03:25.003
we're gonna tackle
<i> Lord of the Rings.</i>

03:25.005 --> 03:26.505
Have I?
Ever read it?

03:26.507 --> 03:27.706
ADULT ADAM:<i> I had not.</i>

03:27.708 --> 03:28.540
(CHUCKLING) Have I?

03:28.542 --> 03:32.811
<i> I really hadn't,</i>
<i> but this girl was perfect,</i>
<i> so lying seemed right.</i>

03:32.813 --> 03:35.647
I must have read it like...
Zero to 10 times.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.283
It's a date!
Talk about it
at the meeting?

03:38.686 --> 03:39.418
It's not a date.

03:39.420 --> 03:42.754
Well, a date as in "a moment
marked in my calendar."

03:42.756 --> 03:43.755
I'm gonna go now.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.557
ADULT ADAM:
<i> I had a date! Kinda.</i>

03:45.559 --> 03:47.926
<i> All I had to do was read</i>
Lord of the Rings.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.494
<i> How hard could it be?</i>

03:49.496 --> 03:51.230
(GROANS)
<i> Turns out, very.</i>

03:51.232 --> 03:54.666
<i> It was super-long and boring</i>
<i> and made me mad.</i>

03:54.668 --> 03:55.834
Hey! Easy!

03:55.836 --> 03:58.237
You could kill someone
with that dictionary.

03:58.239 --> 03:59.538
It's not a dictionary, Pops,

03:59.540 --> 04:01.306
even though
it has every word in it.

04:01.308 --> 04:03.909
That's a reading book?
Oh, my.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.211
I met a girl, Pops.
She's older. She knows stuff.

04:06.213 --> 04:10.949
An experienced lady, huh?
Now, this is where
Pops shines.

04:10.951 --> 04:11.583
How can I help you?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.819
What do you know
about hobbits? Talk to me.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.722
Give me your life wisdom
about the Shire. Now!

04:16.724 --> 04:17.489
I don't know
what that is.

04:17.491 --> 04:21.493
I was talking about how to
get your arm around a dame
at a picture show.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.563
Oh, man. I got to read
1,000 pages. I'm screwed!

04:24.565 --> 04:28.133
Why do I got to have a crush
on a girl with required
reading?

04:28.135 --> 04:31.670
Oh! My baby's got a crush!

04:31.672 --> 04:33.739
I have a crush
on my baby having a crush.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.975
I want every detail about her.
Talk. Now. Go. Tell me.

04:36.977 --> 04:37.276
Ugh. Okay.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.645
Her name's Jackie Geary.
We got lots in common.
The end.

04:39.647 --> 04:42.547
I don't know a girl in your
class named Jackie.
Who Jackie?

04:42.549 --> 04:45.550
You don't know her
'cause she's a tad older.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.451
An older woman?

04:46.453 --> 04:49.655
No, no, no.
My baby is not ready
for an adult lady.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.824
Jackie's just a junior.
She barely has
her driver's license.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.727
She drives?
Like some 25-year-old?

04:55.729 --> 04:56.361
Uh, not happening.

04:56.363 --> 05:00.265
You stay away
from this speedy girl
and her creepy love van.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.700
None of what you said
is true!

05:01.702 --> 05:03.602
She drives her nana's
old station wagon.

05:03.604 --> 05:04.970
What's the nana like?
Stop.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.439
Do you know what happens
in the back
of a station wagon?

05:07.441 --> 05:10.642
Mouth-smooching
and adult hugging.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.210
Now get in bed
for tucks. Boop!

05:12.212 --> 05:14.846
ADULT ADAM:<i> As my mom</i>
<i> shut down my dream nerd girl,</i>

05:14.848 --> 05:17.916
<i> Barry was still planning</i>
<i> his dream prom.</i>

05:17.918 --> 05:18.950
Five days till prom.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.352
I don't want to ruin
the surprise,

05:20.354 --> 05:22.187
but I hope you're not
allergic to horse hair.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.289
Babe, I've been thinking
about this a lot,

05:24.291 --> 05:26.958
and I can't go to prom.
What are you saying?

05:26.960 --> 05:27.326
It's Erica.

05:27.328 --> 05:32.164
I can't have a good time
knowing my best friend is
staying home all by herself.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.632
That makes sense.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.533
You're a good person.
I totally get it.

05:34.535 --> 05:37.903
Wow. Kind of thought
you'd go nuts about this
and get all kicky and punchy.

05:37.905 --> 05:43.408
Well, dating you has made me
a more mature, stronger,
better man.

05:43.877 --> 05:44.810
Hyah!

05:44.812 --> 05:45.711
You're taking my sister
to prom!

05:45.713 --> 05:48.680
Barry, are you even
in this class?
I'm in the middle of a test.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.916
You will do this,
or I will fight your father

05:50.918 --> 05:53.585
in front of
your entire family,
shaming your bloodline.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.421
Dude, you know I'd love
to go to prom with Erica,

05:56.423 --> 05:58.523
but our timing's
always been wrong.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.825
It's just not meant to be.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.727
Geoff, stand up!

06:01.729 --> 06:06.064
You will take
my sister to prom,
and you know why?

06:06.066 --> 06:08.934
'Cause you need
to bet on love
before it's too late.

06:08.936 --> 06:12.604
He's right. In the end,
we only regret
the chances we didn't take.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.940
No one cares
what you think, Matthew.

06:14.942 --> 06:18.143
But his inspiring words
are right. The time is now.

06:18.145 --> 06:21.546
(SIGHS) Okay.
I'll give it a shot.
Yes!

06:21.548 --> 06:24.049
You won't regret
being my pawn, Geoffrey.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.419
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm super-late
for my chem final.

06:27.421 --> 06:27.819
Hyah!

06:27.821 --> 06:29.388
ADULT ADAM:<i> With that,</i>
<i> Barry saved his prom.</i>

06:29.390 --> 06:33.158
<i> Meanwhile, I was trying to</i>
<i> rescue my</i> Lord of the Rings
<i> problem</i>

06:33.160 --> 06:35.060
<i> in the shadiest way possible.</i>

06:35.062 --> 06:36.995
Can I help you?
Gah! Nope.

06:36.997 --> 06:37.829
Just browsing.

06:37.831 --> 06:38.630
ADULT ADAM:<i> But I wasn't.</i>

06:38.632 --> 06:40.432
<i> I was there to buy</i>
<i> the most illicit thing</i>

06:40.434 --> 06:43.168
<i> you could buy in a bookstore</i>
<i> in the '80s.</i>

06:43.170 --> 06:43.535
Cliff Notes.

06:43.537 --> 06:47.205
<i> Back before the Internet,</i>
<i> this was how we got away</i>
<i> with not reading a book.</i>

06:47.207 --> 06:52.544
<i> Some dude named Cliff</i>
<i> summarized an entire story</i>
<i> into a little yellow pamphlet.</i>

06:52.546 --> 06:53.879
Hey, last-minute
book report, huh?

06:53.881 --> 06:56.648
No. That's cheating.
I don't do that.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.283
I need to read this
'cause I lied to a girl.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.485
If I were you, I'd just
tell people you're cheating.

07:00.487 --> 07:03.155
ADULT ADAM:<i> But instead,</i>
<i> I copied from Cliff,</i>

07:03.157 --> 07:05.524
<i> and Jackie bought it big-time.</i>

07:05.526 --> 07:06.992
Wow,
this is awesome,

07:06.994 --> 07:08.126
the way you summarized
every chapter.

07:08.128 --> 07:11.062
You could totally sell this
to help people
understand the book better.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.365
It is a dense book,
some would say boring.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.967
Not me. I'm just glad
we definitely have this
in common.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.603
It's working!
His Cliff Notes sham
is working!

07:18.605 --> 07:20.605
He'll blow it somehow.
Trust the process.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.774
What strikes me most
are the parallels

07:22.776 --> 07:25.076
between<i> Lord of the Rings</i>
and<i> Star Wars.</i>

07:25.078 --> 07:27.813
Yes! He's steering
the conversation
into his sweet spot.

07:27.815 --> 07:28.613
I need to find
new friends.

07:28.615 --> 07:32.150
Hey! Our next issue should be
all about<i> Star Wars.</i>

07:32.152 --> 07:34.519
<i> Star Wars</i> is too commercial
for my taste.

07:34.521 --> 07:36.922
Oh, no!
She's beyond<i> Star Wars!</i>

07:36.924 --> 07:38.323
This girl's way too fast
for Adam.

07:38.325 --> 07:39.658
I think you're both
very confused

07:39.660 --> 07:41.092
about the concept
of a fast girl.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.661
You're right. We should tackle
the rest of the<i> Rings,</i>

07:42.663 --> 07:45.530
give the people
what they want.
This is the best, right?

07:45.532 --> 07:46.765
I'll go start
laying out this issue,

07:46.767 --> 07:48.567
and also,
we should go to prom!
Excuse me?

07:48.569 --> 07:52.704
Um... I just blurted that out,
but I meant it?

07:52.706 --> 07:54.072
Oh, God. Prom is dumb.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.740
It is dumb,
and I'll totally go.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.242
Really?
Yes!

07:57.511 --> 08:00.445
It's French bread pizza day,
Holmes!

08:00.914 --> 08:02.714
So it's a date?
(CHUCKLES)

08:02.716 --> 08:04.015
I guess this time,
it is.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.185
I'll wear my hair
in Leia buns.
No! I'll wear braids.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.288
No! I'll wear my hair
just like this. Bye, now.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.892
Enjoy prom, liar.
This isn't my fault!

08:13.894 --> 08:15.026
You're super-boned, dude.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.695
Be less invested,
Dave Kim!

08:16.697 --> 08:18.330
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As my lies scored me a date,</i>

08:18.332 --> 08:20.966
<i> Erica was getting</i>
<i> a prom date of her own...</i>

08:20.968 --> 08:21.533
Hey, yo, Erica.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.668
ADULT ADAM:
<i> ...just not who she wanted.</i>

08:23.670 --> 08:24.669
Yo...
Ruben Amaro Jr.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.105
Thought maybe you'd like
to check out prom with me.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.874
Uh...okay.
Why not?

08:28.876 --> 08:31.877
Wow. You're really pumped
about this.

08:31.879 --> 08:32.611
Call you with the details?

08:32.613 --> 08:34.980
Is there anything else
I really need to know?

08:34.982 --> 08:39.084
Guess not.
Then we're done.
Good stuff.

08:39.753 --> 08:43.088
Erica Goldberg,
will you go to prom
with me?

08:43.090 --> 08:44.222
Oh, come on, man!

08:44.224 --> 08:46.558
I literally just said yes
to Ruben Amaro Jr.!

08:46.560 --> 08:49.060
But this was supposed to
finally work out for us,

08:49.062 --> 08:49.928
and now it can't!
Duh!

08:49.930 --> 08:53.532
Ugh! I am so frustrated with
how we suck so bad at this!

08:53.534 --> 08:54.966
So bad!

08:55.736 --> 08:57.035
So, you don't want
to go with me?

08:57.037 --> 09:00.105
I mean, I'm in love
with another dude,
so not really.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.574
But don't worry.
You'll bounce back.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.043
Okay.
Awesome news.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.712
I blew off Ruben,
and we're going to prom.

09:07.714 --> 09:08.647
Oh, no!

09:08.649 --> 09:10.916
What? What did you do?
He's going with me.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.851
I was just using him
to make Johnny crazy-jealous,

09:12.853 --> 09:15.921
but now I can
make you jealous, too!
This is so hot.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.757
What the hell, Geoff?
You said you were
going with Ruben.

09:18.759 --> 09:19.991
That was four minutes ago!

09:19.993 --> 09:22.027
I was sad and frustrated,
and she asked me.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.963
She wouldn't take "no" for
an answer. She threatened me.

09:24.965 --> 09:25.664
Strongly suggested.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.433
Whatever.
It just isn't meant to be.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.535
(SIGHS)
I love you.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.337
No. What?

09:33.106 --> 09:34.406
Okay.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.809
Ruben Amaro Jr.!
Ruben Amaro Jr.!

09:37.811 --> 09:38.977
Ruben Amaro Jr.!

09:38.979 --> 09:40.445
Please tell me
we're not back on.

09:40.447 --> 09:41.880
Oh, we most
definitely are.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.382
Rent a tux,
'cause we are locked in.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.217
Erica! Erica!

09:46.219 --> 09:48.320
Great news!
Don't even say it.

09:48.322 --> 09:51.189
We are the worst!
Carla, wait!

09:51.191 --> 09:54.125
Hope you're ready for
the best night of your life.
No way!

09:54.127 --> 09:56.695
This is what you get
when you don't
call me back, Johnny!

09:56.697 --> 09:58.263
Look, I... I really
don't want to be

09:58.265 --> 09:59.064
in the middle
of whatever this is.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.900
I'll tell you what this is...
Johnny's gonna fight you,

10:01.902 --> 10:03.568
and I'm gonna feel
so special.

10:03.570 --> 10:04.502
Wait! What?

10:04.504 --> 10:06.104
She's crazy,
but she don't lie.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.506
Pop your shirt off, homeslice.
Let's dance.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.742
That's all I wanted,
was to dance!

10:12.879 --> 10:15.647
Okay, so, I had
a heart-to-heart with Ruben.
Not right now, okay?

10:15.649 --> 10:17.148
I'm about to fistfight
over Carla.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.583
Just forget it. Ruben!

10:18.585 --> 10:20.952
Someone throw
a freakin' punch!
Fight over me!

10:20.954 --> 10:22.487
Fight over
your prom princess!

10:22.489 --> 10:24.022
No!
(GRUNTS)

10:26.526 --> 10:27.926
That was so hot.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.598
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It had been two days</i>

10:33.600 --> 10:35.000
<i> since Barry pulled</i>
<i> the fire alarm...</i>

10:35.002 --> 10:36.735
(ALARM RINGING)
<i> ...in the name of love.</i>

10:36.737 --> 10:37.836
<i> So he did it again.</i>

10:37.838 --> 10:42.374
Barry! I told you
I'm not going to prom
unless Erica does.

10:42.376 --> 10:43.274
Funny you should
bring that up.

10:43.276 --> 10:47.078
Go on, Erica.
Tell your best friend
all the latest gossip.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.949
Meh. I'm going with
Ruben Amaro Jr.
It kinda sucks.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.517
Okay, I'm a pretty
confident dude,

10:52.519 --> 10:53.318
but this is a lot
even for me.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.454
Doesn't matter.
Still a warm body
to keep her distracted.

10:56.456 --> 10:57.889
Actually, I just want to stay
home and watch "Dallas."

10:57.891 --> 11:00.992
I mean, this whole
"Who Shot J.R.?" thing
is really hanging over me.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.128
Who cares who shot J.R.?

11:03.130 --> 11:04.429
It was probably
some guy with a big hat.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.165
Is there actually a fire?
I'm very scared.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.500
This isn't about you, Dan!

11:08.502 --> 11:11.803
This is about my girlfriend
making ridiculous excuses.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.371
Fine! I don't want
to go to prom with you!

11:13.373 --> 11:14.572
There! I said it!
What?

11:14.574 --> 11:15.674
But it's the biggest night
of his life.

11:15.676 --> 11:19.144
Exactly. We have
the best night of our lives,
and then what?

11:19.146 --> 11:21.146
I mean, three months from now
I'll be off to college,

11:21.148 --> 11:21.746
and you'll still be here.

11:21.748 --> 11:24.349
But we agreed
to make the most
of our time left.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.217
I just can't keep pretending
everything is great

11:26.219 --> 11:30.455
when there is a ticking clock
on my heart utterly breaking.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.857
What are you saying?
I'm sorry.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.660
I'm done making believe
everything will be okay.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.262
I can't believe it.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.197
My girlfriend
just broke up with me.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.366
I know.
We all know.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.902
There were hundreds
of your judgy peers watching.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.170
What am I gonna do?

11:45.172 --> 11:48.506
Come on. Bring it in
for a two-person huddle.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.209
Let Coach give you
a pep talk with his body.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.010
(CRYING)
That's it.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.979
You soak that rayon shirt down
with your boy tears

11:54.981 --> 11:56.214
until you feel
the strength return.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.515
ADULT ADAM:<i> As Barry's</i>
<i> love life fell apart,</i>

11:57.517 --> 12:01.152
<i> I was trying to get through</i>
<i> the second</i> Lord of the Rings
<i> book.</i>

12:01.154 --> 12:03.755
Got your jammies
all warm and toasty!

12:03.757 --> 12:05.757
Don't you knock?
Why would I
have to knock?

12:05.759 --> 12:06.725
What have you got there?
What are you hiding?

12:06.727 --> 12:09.427
Nothing. Just some
light reading material
a friend suggested.

12:09.429 --> 12:13.331
Is this friend
the older seductress
you're making time with?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.366
(CHUCKLES) Let me guess,
she's got you hooked on

12:15.368 --> 12:17.836
all those lusty
Danielle Steel novels?

12:17.838 --> 12:20.705
No! It's personal, okay?
Oh, my God!

12:20.707 --> 12:24.075
Why is there
an impossibly adorable
tuxedo in your closet?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.110
Okay, I was
gonna tell you...

12:25.112 --> 12:26.845
Jackie's either
taking you to prom

12:26.847 --> 12:29.013
or Monte Carlo
for the weekend,

12:29.015 --> 12:30.515
and neither
are acceptable.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.417
It's prom.
And I already said yes.

12:32.419 --> 12:36.454
You are a little freshman boy.
I forbid you to go to prom!

12:36.456 --> 12:37.689
Mom, I can't cancel.

12:37.691 --> 12:38.823
Fine.
I'll make you a deal.

12:38.825 --> 12:41.893
Have her over
for some cold milk
and homemade cookies,

12:41.895 --> 12:44.295
and I'll get to know her,
make my decision then.

12:44.297 --> 12:47.465
Finally. You're being
normal about this.
I'll go call her.

12:47.467 --> 12:51.236
ADULT ADAM:
<i> But, just like Gollum,</i>
<i> my mom was not to be trusted.</i>

12:51.238 --> 12:54.973
Yes, bring your
precious girl to me.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.641
Bring her.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.743
What was that?
I heard a weird voice.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.679
Not a voice.
I coughed. (COUGHS)

13:01.681 --> 13:04.149
ADULT ADAM:<i> As my mom invited</i>
<i> my geeky dream girl over,</i>

13:04.151 --> 13:07.185
<i> Barry was living a nightmare</i>
<i> after being dumped.</i>

13:07.187 --> 13:09.821
Hey, Bar.
How you holding up, big guy?

13:09.823 --> 13:12.157
We, uh, brought you
your favorite jerky

13:12.159 --> 13:13.191
and Hubba Bubba
Bubble Gum soda.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.728
I'm too sad to drink them,
but I'll take the jerky.

13:16.730 --> 13:19.531
This should tide me over until
Lainey comes to her senses.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.399
Ah. I see what this is.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.035
He's going through
the five stages of grief.

13:24.037 --> 13:24.969
First stage is denial.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.672
Wait, so once I get through
the five stages,

13:27.674 --> 13:28.706
I'll feel perfectly
fine again?

13:28.708 --> 13:31.309
Well, yeah, but healing
takes a long time.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.977
Let's do this,
Matt Bradley!

13:32.979 --> 13:35.180
What's the next stage
for me to race through?

13:35.182 --> 13:36.915
I guess...anger?

13:36.917 --> 13:41.085
(SCREAMS) I'm very mad!

13:41.087 --> 13:42.320
Next.
Uh, bargaining?

13:42.322 --> 13:43.588
Give me $5
for this hockey stick.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.657
That's not the kind of
bargaining I'm talking about.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.725
Do you want the stick
or not?
Sure?

13:47.727 --> 13:48.726
Okay, great. Next stage.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.929
Uh, next would be
sadness.
Pass. Next.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.630
Uh, I guess all that's left
is acceptance.

13:52.632 --> 13:56.267
Great, 'cause I accept
your gift of this meat tube
and gum-flavored soda.

13:56.269 --> 13:59.771
I kind of meant
that you have to accept
that it's done with Lainey.

13:59.773 --> 14:01.472
I will never accept that.

14:01.474 --> 14:04.042
In fact, I'm gonna go
get her back right now.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.511
That's 'cause you're
obviously still in denial.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.012
JTP!
ALL: JTP!

14:08.014 --> 14:09.147
JTP.
Yes!

14:09.149 --> 14:10.515
You got to
give the guy credit.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.183
He always fights
for what he wants.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.952
Yeah, he does,
doesn't he?

14:13.954 --> 14:16.287
And you know what?
So will I, damn it!

14:16.289 --> 14:18.756
Erica Goldberg,
will you go to prom with me?

14:18.758 --> 14:20.725
Dude! We covered this.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.660
The universe doesn't
want us to be together.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.262
I know,
but then I think about

14:24.264 --> 14:25.129
the most important
night of the year,

14:25.131 --> 14:28.733
and there's only one person
I want to spend it with...
You.

14:28.735 --> 14:32.604
What if there was a way
that we could keep our dates,
but still go together?

14:32.606 --> 14:33.471
And how would we do that?

14:33.473 --> 14:35.240
Double date.
We take the limo together,

14:35.242 --> 14:38.142
we go to dinner together,
we even dance near each other.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.812
So we go to prom
next to each other.

14:40.814 --> 14:41.946
Suck on that, universe!

14:41.948 --> 14:44.515
Great! We'll pick you up
at 7:00.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.618
This cannot go wrong.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.686
Oh!
Oh, my God! Oh, no!

14:48.688 --> 14:49.888
Aah! Teeth!

14:49.890 --> 14:52.957
God! One day,
this will work.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.060
It's so nice to finally
meet you, Mrs. Goldberg.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.695
Oh, same. (CHUCKLES)

14:57.697 --> 14:59.564
Adam's told me so much
about you.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.966
Like, for instance,
you're almost a senior.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.601
Yeah, that's called
being a junior.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.037
(TIMER DINGS)
Oh. Snickerdoodles
are ready.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.605
Squishy-tush,
would you get them for me?

15:07.607 --> 15:11.142
I would, but these old hips
don't move like they used to.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.878
That's what happens
when you get older.
Am I right, Jackie?

15:13.880 --> 15:15.813
Don't answer!
I'll get the cookies.

15:15.815 --> 15:19.384
You two just sit here
in awkward silence
until I get back.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.086
So...
So...

15:22.088 --> 15:24.822
What exactly
are your intentions
towards my boy?

15:24.824 --> 15:26.691
Excuse me?
Are they honorable?

15:26.693 --> 15:27.592
Uh... Sure?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.193
Well, then let's lay out
some ground rules.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.362
There will be no graphic
language or adult situations.

15:31.364 --> 15:35.967
There will also be
no smoking, no joking,
and no midnight toking.

15:35.969 --> 15:36.768
Tolkien, like the writer?

15:36.770 --> 15:40.238
There will also be
no smooching,
no prolonged hugging,

15:40.240 --> 15:42.140
and no intimate horseplay.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.207
Repeat it all back to me.

15:43.209 --> 15:44.475
I think you have
the wrong idea about me.

15:44.477 --> 15:48.479
Really? Then why is
my little baby suddenly
hiding things from me?

15:48.481 --> 15:51.049
Hiding what?
You tell me.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.086
Aha! Ha ha!
Oh, no!
My secret brown bag.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.722
Wait, uh, where's
the tawdry fantasy books

15:57.724 --> 15:59.958
with the top-heavy woman in
a peasant shirt on the cover?

15:59.960 --> 16:03.261
Cliff Notes? You told me
you loved<i> Lord of the Rings.</i>

16:03.263 --> 16:04.529
I'm sorry.
I tried to read it,

16:04.531 --> 16:05.897
but it's the longest book
about the shortest people.

16:05.899 --> 16:10.568
But you wrote an article
on Tom Bombadil's influence
on the Council of Elrond.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.804
Okay, I see I was
way off the mark here.

16:12.806 --> 16:16.174
You seem sweet,
so, uh, "yes" to prom.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.109
I thought
you were different, Adam.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.510
But you're not.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.212
You're just a liar.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.482
(STAMMERS) How could
you shine a light
on all my lies?

16:24.484 --> 16:24.916
How could you?

16:24.918 --> 16:28.953
Schmoo, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do anything.
I just...

16:28.955 --> 16:30.355
I don't care!

16:30.357 --> 16:31.356
I really liked
that girl.

16:31.358 --> 16:35.093
I tried to read a boring,
million-page book for her.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.715
Uh, what exactly
is happening here?

16:57.717 --> 16:59.117
It's like
that book "Cyrano,"

16:59.119 --> 17:02.587
where his mom comes
and speaks on behalf
of her son.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.556
Okay, I've never read it,

Oh, it's okay.

It's Beverly Goldberg,
Adam's mom.

17:10.263 --> 17:11.529
I'm just appealing
to your daughter

17:11.531 --> 17:14.832
to reconsider my son
as a romantic prospect.

17:14.834 --> 17:15.967
Shouldn't your son
be doing that?

17:15.969 --> 17:18.703
Well... she kind of
caught him in a lie,

17:18.705 --> 17:19.637
which is all my fault.

See?

17:37.991 --> 17:39.690
Adam would
correct me, too.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.659
You are totally
made for each other.

It's cold out.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.653
I didn't have time
to put it on.

18:08.655 --> 18:09.821
You're gonna get
a sniffle.

18:09.823 --> 18:10.888
It's really not
that cold out.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.658
You say that,
but your face is very flushed.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.026
Could we not have
this discussion?

18:15.028 --> 18:16.627
You know, if you're not
wearing a jacket,

18:16.629 --> 18:18.062
you should at least
be wearing a hat.

18:18.064 --> 18:20.798
Mom!
That's what happens
when you get all hot...

18:20.800 --> 18:22.767
Stop!
...outside

18:22.769 --> 18:23.935
Stop.
Think of horses.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.303
I'm begging you, please!

18:25.305 --> 18:26.404
You're gonna be
in the hospital...

18:26.406 --> 18:28.106
Mom!
...with pneumonia,
writing things down...

18:28.108 --> 18:30.141
Mom!
...on a chalkboard
because you can't talk.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.676
Stop.
And then we're
gonna have to have

18:31.678 --> 18:32.610
that whole discussion
about...

18:32.612 --> 18:34.479

...do we take out
Adam's tonsils?

are you doing at her house?

18:37.183 --> 18:37.715
Hey.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.517
Just ignore everything
my mom said.

18:39.519 --> 18:42.453
I swear I really am
the person you thought I was.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.756
Except I really don't get

They just walk and talk

18:48.728 --> 18:50.027

18:50.029 --> 18:50.962
It's okay, Adam.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.297
Your mom
actually made it better.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.765
For real?

18:55.401 --> 18:57.301
So you still want
to go to prom?

18:57.303 --> 18:59.670
Is a nerf herder
scruffy-looking?

18:59.672 --> 19:02.106
Jackie, no one knows
what that is.

19:02.108 --> 19:03.374
I do.
