00:24.667 --> 00:26.375
(man on PA)
'May I have
your attention please?'

00:26.458 --> 00:30.709
'Arriving passengers on
Flight
528 from Bogota, Columbia.'

00:30.792 --> 00:32.000
'You can claim your luggage'

00:32.083 --> 00:34.417
'at baggage claim three,
carousel one.'

01:05.125 --> 01:06.333
Hello.

01:06.417 --> 01:10.792
- Where are you from?
- Medellin, Colombia.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.458
Why are you here?

01:12.542 --> 01:14.166
Visiting my boyfriend.

01:17.709 --> 01:19.542
Third time in the last year.

01:19.625 --> 01:21.417
He misses me.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.000
Is this all your luggage?

01:25.917 --> 01:27.792
Mm-hmm. Yes.

01:27.875 --> 01:29.959
Are you carrying any drugs?

01:30.041 --> 01:31.375
No.

01:36.083 --> 01:38.375
Welcome to the United States.

01:58.917 --> 02:01.583
<i>- Hola, carino.</i>
<i>- Hola.</i>

02:10.458 --> 02:11.917
You look good.

02:13.250 --> 02:15.917
Mentiroso.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.875
Come on.

02:17.959 --> 02:20.083
Let's hit the road.

03:02.375 --> 03:04.458
Go! Go!

03:04.542 --> 03:06.583
(Lilly)
'Narcotics said
it's about a cold job?'

03:06.667 --> 03:08.959
Drug mule killed in
'98,
Ana Castilla.

03:09.041 --> 03:11.041
Number one suspect
was her handler, Ramiro.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.875
- The guy inside.
- Disappeared for eight
years.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.458
Came back to Philly
for his brother's
wedding.

03:15.542 --> 03:17.417
Lill, you
remember
Manny Fernandez.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.417
- My old boss at West.
- Sure. Hi.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.959
Me and Manny worked
the Cortez drug bust together.

03:22.041 --> 03:24.792
Ramiro was
Cortez's point
man.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.041
Nailing Cortez was the biggest
takedown of the '90s.

03:27.125 --> 03:29.125
- Your undercover job.
- 'Hmm.'

03:31.125 --> 03:33.542
I didn't know
you worked undercover.

03:33.625 --> 03:35.083
Just the one job.

03:35.166 --> 03:38.458
- Ramiro's lackey.
- So you knew the victim?

03:38.542 --> 03:40.583
Ana. Yeah.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.458
Alvaro?

03:59.750 --> 04:02.625
- Detective Valens.
- You're a cop?

04:02.709 --> 04:05.000
Yeah, I've been waiting
a long time to see you again.

04:05.083 --> 04:06.792
Son of a bitch.
I trusted you!

04:06.875 --> 04:08.542
Ah, don't break
my heart here, Ramiro.

04:08.625 --> 04:10.417
You moved the drugs
the same as I did.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.792
Ain't gonna be me rottin'
in a prison cell though, is
it?

04:12.875 --> 04:14.125
What'd you do to Ana Castilla?

04:14.208 --> 04:16.417
- I didn't do nothing to
her!
- Right.

04:16.500 --> 04:21.000
Who cares...about
a dumb bitch mule?

04:21.083 --> 04:23.542
- 'Let's go, pal.'
- I did.

05:04.542 --> 05:06.041
(Will)
'Undercover, huh?'

05:06.125 --> 05:08.041
(Scotty)
'Uh, yeah.'

05:08.125 --> 05:10.667
Seems like something
that would've come up.

05:10.750 --> 05:14.709
Also went to soccer camp as
a kid. I ever mention that?

05:14.792 --> 05:17.959
Yeah, but the Cortez bust,
and that was huge.

05:18.041 --> 05:20.709
Would think you'd still be
bragging about it.

05:20.792 --> 05:23.709
- What'd you do for Ramiro?
- I was a driver.

05:23.792 --> 05:27.542
Supposed to find out
the chain of command.

05:27.625 --> 05:29.667
Ana Castilla. 22.

05:29.750 --> 05:32.959
Found stabbed and gutted
outside of St. Abigail's
Church.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.625
(Will)
'Died from a pellet
bursting?'

05:34.709 --> 05:36.083
They cut her open
to get the drugs?

05:36.166 --> 05:38.417
That was the theory.
Ramiro was her boss.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.625
'And the number one suspect.'

05:40.709 --> 05:42.875
Job went cold
when he skipped town.

05:42.959 --> 05:45.917
But now he's back,
and on our turf.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.291
And you knew Ana?

05:47.375 --> 05:48.917
I picked up the girls
at the airport

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
brought them to Ramiro.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.542
You get Ana
all three of her trips?

05:51.625 --> 05:54.583
Yeah, we talked.
Connected, I guess.

05:54.667 --> 05:56.667
This was gonna
be her last run.

05:56.750 --> 05:57.667
Oh, yeah?

05:57.750 --> 05:58.959
She was 24 hours away

05:59.041 --> 06:01.917
from getting out,
going home to Colombia.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.583
You see her the day she died?

06:04.667 --> 06:05.959
Yeah.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.125
You never brought
flowers before.

06:17.208 --> 06:20.959
Well, there was a lady
selling them outside.

06:21.041 --> 06:23.291
Never kissed me before either.

06:25.333 --> 06:28.542
Just making it look good.

06:34.500 --> 06:38.000
You must be fighting
with your real girlfriend.

06:39.709 --> 06:43.625
- What makes you say that?
- I'm right, yeah?

06:48.208 --> 06:51.083
Eh, she wants a wedding date.

06:51.166 --> 06:53.417
'And I don't know
what the rush is.'

06:53.500 --> 06:57.333
You should be happy
you have someone, Alvaro.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.625
I just don't see doing that
till I want kids.

07:00.709 --> 07:03.166
When is that?

07:03.250 --> 07:04.917
Forty, maybe.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.667
You're like my
sister Sofia.

07:06.750 --> 07:09.834
<i>la princesa</i>
because she wants everything.

07:09.917 --> 07:11.834
<i>Asi.</i>

07:17.583 --> 07:19.709
(Scotty)
'What's that?'

07:19.792 --> 07:23.166
It's what I want.

07:23.250 --> 07:26.625
Get a job for a big company
in Bogota.

07:26.709 --> 07:29.959
Work by a window
with a nice view..

07:30.041 --> 07:32.625
'...flowers on my desk.'

07:32.709 --> 07:35.208
Bet you could make that happen.

07:36.917 --> 07:38.208
'So..'

07:38.291 --> 07:39.542
...you going to stop this work?

07:39.625 --> 07:42.000
I'm telling Ramiro tonight.

07:43.667 --> 07:45.709
You know he won't
let you go easy.

07:45.792 --> 07:46.875
I know.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.875
Dropped her at
the motel where they..

08:00.959 --> 08:03.208
...collect the goods
from the girls.

08:03.291 --> 08:05.750
Next morning,
her body's found.

08:05.834 --> 08:08.041
- You look into it at all?
- 'Couldn't.'

08:08.125 --> 08:09.417
I was still on the job.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.542
Maybe Ana didn't die
from a pellet bursting.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.834
Maybe Ramiro killed her
'cause she wanted out.

08:13.917 --> 08:15.500
Then why cut her open?

08:15.583 --> 08:17.125
A warning to his other girls

08:17.208 --> 08:19.041
keep them in their place?

08:19.125 --> 08:21.583
Narcotics just handed Ramiro
over to West.

08:21.667 --> 08:25.291
- You can have a go at him.
- Yeah? Good.

08:40.083 --> 08:42.333
That suit looks like
a Halloween costume on you.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.875
Trick or
treat,
huh, Alvaro?

08:45.959 --> 08:47.583
Forgot how funny
you were.

08:47.667 --> 08:49.417
And how stupid.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.291
Weddings and funerals
always bring back the dummies

08:52.375 --> 08:53.417
who are supposed
to stay lost.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.750
I figured eight years later

08:54.834 --> 08:56.750
you wouldn't still have
your nose to the ground.

08:56.834 --> 09:00.834
But I guess you had it bad
for her, eh, Alvaro?

09:00.917 --> 09:02.667
Don't call me that.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.458
Hermano,
how you watched her.

09:05.542 --> 09:08.291
Were you doing her
the whole time?

09:08.375 --> 09:10.458
Huh? Alvaro?

09:12.291 --> 09:13.542
Did you hear
me or not?

09:13.625 --> 09:14.750
Why'd you cut up Ana?

09:14.834 --> 09:16.458
'She OD from the
drugs inside her?'

09:16.542 --> 09:18.417
We got all 70 cookies,
no problem.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.250
So why's she gutted like a fish?

09:20.333 --> 09:23.291
Someone sliced her,
make it look like me.

09:23.375 --> 09:24.667
But I never touched her.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.875
Ana wanted out.
She told you that, didn't
she?

09:26.959 --> 09:29.750
Por favor,
all talk big. So what?

09:29.834 --> 09:32.792
(Lilly)
'But this girl, good
English'

09:32.875 --> 09:35.917
gutsy, she was one of your best.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.500
No way you were letting her go.

09:37.583 --> 09:40.166
What happened, Ramiro?

09:40.250 --> 09:43.291
She lost her mind. That's what.

09:51.417 --> 09:54.250
<i>Tranquila.</i>

09:55.417 --> 09:57.917
You'll be okay
when they're all
out.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
You felt like this too?

10:00.083 --> 10:01.875
For a little while.

10:01.959 --> 10:03.500
But I'm fine now, see?

10:03.583 --> 10:04.709
<i>Si.</i>

10:06.709 --> 10:09.125
- I did this for my son.
- Yeah?

10:09.208 --> 10:12.500
To get him out of jail.
His wife gave up on him.

10:12.583 --> 10:16.458
He's a good boy.
He just needs another chance.

10:17.792 --> 10:21.125
Ana, you travel
again in two months.

10:23.041 --> 10:25.834
<i>Fuerte, mi hija, fuerte.</i>

10:31.583 --> 10:33.709
<i>♪ Y no va a parar.. ♪♪</i>

10:34.834 --> 10:36.208
No, Ramiro.

10:36.291 --> 10:38.125
This is my last run.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.125
Oh, you decide now?

10:42.208 --> 10:44.333
I have the money
to help my sister.

10:44.417 --> 10:46.083
But you haven't even
been paid yet.

10:46.166 --> 10:48.041
Oh, yeah, I gave
you
all 70 cookies.

10:48.125 --> 10:51.125
But you haven't
been paid yet.

10:53.333 --> 10:55.250
You don't need me.
You have lots of girls.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.917
But not everyone
can bluff like you.

10:58.834 --> 11:00.917
Those big innocent eyes. Huh?

11:02.083 --> 11:04.542
People believe your crap.

11:04.625 --> 11:07.458
- I want out.
- What matters is what I
want!

11:07.542 --> 11:08.667
You understand?

11:08.750 --> 11:10.583
And I want to keep
the money from this trip

11:10.667 --> 11:11.750
you'll get it next time.

11:11.834 --> 11:14.583
- You can't keep me here.
- Hmm?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.333
Where will you go
without this?

11:21.375 --> 11:23.208
Mm-mmm.

11:27.333 --> 11:28.834
Come get it.

11:33.834 --> 11:36.875
<i>♪ Flota y flota</i>
<i>el pinche gusano.. ♪♪</i>

11:36.959 --> 11:38.834
I came out in a few minutes.

11:38.917 --> 11:41.250
- She was gone.
- Where could she go?

11:41.333 --> 11:42.834
No money, no passport.

11:42.917 --> 11:46.208
If you're smart
like you, you stay
alive.

11:46.291 --> 11:48.083
She was dumb,
so she's dead.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.792
- She wasn't dumb.
- Okay, she was a genius.

11:50.875 --> 11:53.041
She's still dead.

11:57.375 --> 11:58.959
Hmm?

11:59.041 --> 12:01.542
You should have seen
him with this Ana.

12:01.625 --> 12:03.500
'He was all over her.'

12:04.458 --> 12:06.125
He says she was just a friend.

12:06.208 --> 12:08.625
And you believe what he says?

12:08.709 --> 12:11.625
Do you think
that he's never lied to you?

12:11.709 --> 12:14.083
You didn't know him then.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.291
I did.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.208
We're done here.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.500
So how many of the drug cookies
could one girl swallow?

12:27.583 --> 12:28.959
Up to 80.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.667
And they're each
worth two or three grand?

12:31.750 --> 12:33.000
So every girl's carrying

12:33.083 --> 12:35.291
a quarter of a million bucks
in her gut.

12:35.375 --> 12:38.041
No wonder they open
them up if they die.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.625
- How did you do?
- Talked to her drug buddies.

12:39.709 --> 12:41.500
- Think we got a lead.
- There's a Colombian guy.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.208
Helps newcomers
in the
community.

12:43.291 --> 12:44.500
El Ranchero.

12:44.583 --> 12:47.750
- Also known as Father
Peralta.
- A priest?

12:47.834 --> 12:50.333
Who, in '98, told the cops
he didn't know Ana

12:50.417 --> 12:51.834
but her contacts
say otherwise.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.166
Is that right?

12:53.250 --> 12:55.041
And guess what church
he serves?

12:55.917 --> 12:58.000
St. Abigail's.

12:58.083 --> 13:00.291
Where Ana's body was found.

13:06.667 --> 13:09.750
(Scotty)
'Local Colombians say
you're known as El Ranchero.'

13:09.834 --> 13:12.041
- The rancher.
- 'Cause you wrangle the
mules.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.542
That some kind of joke?

13:13.625 --> 13:17.041
[chuckles]
I can't help
what people call me.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.041
But you do
help
these girls.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.583
I do what I can.

13:20.667 --> 13:24.250
You help a girl named Ana,
September '98?

13:27.291 --> 13:29.250
(Peralta)
'Hard to forget
that pretty face.'

13:29.333 --> 13:32.834
You know she ended up
your

13:34.583 --> 13:38.583
I was new here,
was reaching out to these
girls.

13:38.667 --> 13:40.542
'Figured it was someone
warning me not to.'

13:40.625 --> 13:42.500
- And?
- 'I ignored it.'

13:42.583 --> 13:44.709
Help them still today.

13:44.792 --> 13:46.500
What'd you do
for Ana that night?

13:46.583 --> 13:49.625
Gave her a place to stay,
sanctuary in the church.

13:49.709 --> 13:52.375
Out of the kindness
of your heart?

13:52.458 --> 13:56.041
Saints, sinners,
I serve people in need.

13:56.125 --> 13:58.917
But you didn't help the cops
solve her murder.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.834
You said you didn't even
know Ana in '98.

14:03.417 --> 14:05.750
These girls work
for drug dealers.

14:05.834 --> 14:08.625
Most of my parishioners
are here illegally.

14:08.709 --> 14:10.875
I'm not gonna deal with cops.

14:10.959 --> 14:12.333
So what else did you lie about?

14:12.417 --> 14:14.709
Are you suggesting I had
something to do with Ana dying?

14:14.792 --> 14:16.125
Did you?

14:17.583 --> 14:20.750
I was administering last
rites
at a hospital that night

14:20.834 --> 14:22.000
'in Cobbs Creek.'

14:22.083 --> 14:24.083
Anyone else here with Ana?

14:24.166 --> 14:26.917
There was another girl
in hiding. Ceci.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.834
Know where we
can find Ceci?

14:28.917 --> 14:31.917
Mm-hmm.
I helped her get her job.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.333
(Lilly)
'Philadelphia Police.'

14:40.417 --> 14:43.208
I'm just a housekeeper,
and I have all my papers.

14:43.291 --> 14:45.250
Ms. Caroline can tell you.

14:45.333 --> 14:48.375
We're here about Ana
Castilla's
murder, Ceci.

14:49.375 --> 14:50.792
I-I heard they cut her up.

14:50.875 --> 14:54.625
Yeah, but we're not sure
she was holding any drugs.

14:54.709 --> 14:57.875
You know why someone
might have done that?

14:57.959 --> 14:59.709
It could be revenge.

14:59.792 --> 15:01.291
Girls are property.

15:01.375 --> 15:03.667
Dealers don't like them
getting away.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.834
I was lucky this was all I got

15:05.917 --> 15:08.250
the first time
I tried to run.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.333
So how'd you finally get out?

15:11.417 --> 15:12.500
After ten runs

15:12.583 --> 15:14.917
my stomach couldn't hold
anything no more.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.917
I was useless to them.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.250
You were bunked up
with Ana at the church

15:19.333 --> 15:20.917
the night she died.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
(Ceci)
'Those were bad times.'

15:24.208 --> 15:26.166
Well, looks like
things have
improved.

15:26.250 --> 15:29.125
No, my boss gives me
her hand-me-downs.

15:29.208 --> 15:31.667
What do you remember
about Ana that night?

15:31.750 --> 15:33.083
(Ceci)
'Uh, she was a nice girl'

15:33.166 --> 15:35.583
trying to help
her little sister.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.709
She was wound up.

15:38.792 --> 15:40.458
Running for your life
will do that.

15:40.542 --> 15:41.667
She talk to you about Ramiro?

15:41.750 --> 15:43.500
(Ceci)
'That's all she
talked about..'

15:44.583 --> 15:47.458
...how she had to make it home.

15:57.875 --> 16:02.000
After the first run,
I bought my parents a car.

16:02.083 --> 16:03.959
Sofia wanted to know
where I got the money.

16:04.041 --> 16:06.542
- Did you tell her?
- 'No.'

16:06.625 --> 16:08.834
She looks up to me.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.583
It pays good..

16:13.667 --> 16:15.375
...being a secretary?

16:15.458 --> 16:17.583
If I could get a job like that

16:17.667 --> 16:19.667
I could put her in school.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.291
I bet you
could get a job too.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.166
I don't want to go back there.

16:27.375 --> 16:30.208
Besides, I'm
going
to Miami soon..

16:31.458 --> 16:33.291
...with my boyfriend.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.500
What are you waiting for?

16:35.583 --> 16:37.041
(Ceci)
'He's caught up too, you
know?'

16:37.125 --> 16:39.166
He's trying to
get out, like us.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.625
Oh, yeah?

16:42.709 --> 16:44.291
Are you okay?

16:45.500 --> 16:47.959
I quit using when I got here.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.792
Father Peralta's rules.

16:52.375 --> 16:56.291
<i>diga me,</i>
what's Miami like?

16:56.375 --> 16:59.917
Hmm...nightclubs..

17:00.000 --> 17:03.583
'...music...sun.'

17:03.667 --> 17:06.333
Sun all of the time.

17:08.458 --> 17:09.709
'Oh, my God, Ana.'

17:09.792 --> 17:12.500
How did you get away
from Ramiro tonight?

17:14.667 --> 17:16.709
I ran.

17:16.792 --> 17:19.875
Left a new lady there.
She was sick.

17:19.959 --> 17:22.291
If a pellet opened,
there's nothing you can do.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.875
'She's gonna die,
if you're there or not.'

17:23.959 --> 17:26.041
But maybe I can get her out,
get her to a doctor.

17:26.125 --> 17:28.125
He would never let you.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.542
Besides, you
can't go back.

17:38.333 --> 17:41.208
I stole two cookies.

17:41.291 --> 17:43.041
What?

17:43.125 --> 17:45.792
- Let me see.
- I hid them.

17:45.875 --> 17:49.208
- Ramiro's gonna kill you,
Ana!
- No.

17:49.291 --> 17:52.750
He's going to give me
my passport for them.

17:56.792 --> 17:58.959
I tried to help her,
but she was crazy.

17:59.041 --> 18:00.458
'She went back
to the motel.'

18:00.542 --> 18:01.709
- Back to Ramiro?
- 'Yeah.'

18:01.792 --> 18:04.291
She had that-that trade
stuck in her head.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.375
- The pellets for her
passport?
- Yeah.

18:07.458 --> 18:08.959
'I wonder if her
sister ever knew'

18:09.041 --> 18:10.625
'how much
Ana wanted to help her.'

18:10.709 --> 18:12.542
Was that the last time
you saw her, Ceci?

18:12.625 --> 18:15.166
She went.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.583
She never came back.

18:23.917 --> 18:26.667
- You lied to us, Ramiro.
- Look who's talking.

18:26.750 --> 18:28.333
Never saw
a guy hustle good as you.

18:28.417 --> 18:29.709
Ana stole two
cookies from
you.

18:29.792 --> 18:31.291
Came back to the
motel
to barter.

18:31.375 --> 18:33.041
You were a natural
on the street, you know why?

18:33.125 --> 18:34.333
Yeah, I know
you killed
her.

18:34.417 --> 18:35.542
You'd cut a girl
up
for a lot less.

18:35.625 --> 18:38.834
You got a criminal nature,
is why.

18:38.917 --> 18:41.834
You loved it
out there, in the dirt.

18:41.917 --> 18:43.959
Not like now.
Choking on that tie.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.917
You're so shined up,
there's nothing left of you.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.458
You bought my act, Ramiro.

18:47.542 --> 18:48.917
- It's your bad.
- That's right.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.750
I bought it.
So did the whole crew.

18:50.834 --> 18:55.125
You're damn good at lying to
the
people you was with every day.

18:56.709 --> 18:58.417
(Scotty)
'Talk trash all you want.'

18:58.500 --> 19:00.417
It don't change
what you did.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.041
Why you care so much
about this girl?

19:03.125 --> 19:05.000
We ain't talking about me.

19:05.083 --> 19:06.709
She came back
to trade you the drugs

19:06.792 --> 19:08.166
for her money and passport.

19:08.250 --> 19:09.291
Is that when the knife came out?

19:09.375 --> 19:12.291
She came, but without the drugs.

19:13.667 --> 19:15.542
So I couldn't kill her.

19:19.667 --> 19:21.792
- Where's Delia?
- 'Gone.'

19:21.875 --> 19:23.125
Where are the cookies?

19:23.208 --> 19:25.458
(Ana)
'I didn't bring them.'

19:27.458 --> 19:28.792
I want my passport

19:28.875 --> 19:30.333
and thousand dollars,
then you'll get them.

19:30.417 --> 19:32.291
Why you think
you can call the shots, huh?

19:32.375 --> 19:33.750
Because I got
something you want

19:33.834 --> 19:36.083
hidden somewhere
you'll never find.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.542
Not how it works.

19:37.625 --> 19:39.417
We do the deal, and I go.

19:40.709 --> 19:42.208
Ramiro.

19:42.291 --> 19:43.542
Got them all.

19:43.625 --> 19:45.625
'Minus the
busted one.'

19:45.709 --> 19:47.792
Oh, God...Delia?

19:47.875 --> 19:51.500
Stop walking unless
you want to be next.

19:51.583 --> 19:55.291
She died.
You know how it
goes.

19:55.375 --> 19:58.500
<i>- Padre!</i>
-

19:58.583 --> 20:01.709
<i>Cierre la puerta,</i>
<i>cierre la puerta.</i>

20:01.792 --> 20:03.917
(Peralta)
'Ramiro, open it!'

20:04.000 --> 20:07.166
<i>'Abre la puerta!'</i>

20:07.250 --> 20:08.875
Open it.

20:14.417 --> 20:16.625
She's coming with me.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.125
<i>♪ Mirame A los ojos</i>
<i>veras lo que soy ♪♪</i>

20:25.208 --> 20:28.041
Father Peralta?
What's he doing there?

20:28.125 --> 20:30.625
He's looking out
for his newest girl.

20:30.709 --> 20:32.709
And I'm the fool
who actually fears God.

20:32.792 --> 20:34.291
What's that mean,
his newest girl?

20:34.375 --> 20:36.834
You think that he took care
of young, pretty girls

20:36.917 --> 20:39.625
just for Heaven points? No.

20:39.709 --> 20:42.500
He's getting something back,
and it wasn't nothing holy.

20:42.583 --> 20:43.792
Ana wouldn't do that.

20:43.875 --> 20:47.792
She put 70 lumps
of heroin in her gut.

20:47.875 --> 20:49.834
She wouldn't do something
naughty for a night of safety?

20:49.917 --> 20:52.291
Come on, Alvaro.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.208
Sure she would.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.583
You were at the motel
<i>Padre.</i>

21:01.667 --> 21:04.083
Hours before she died.

21:05.709 --> 21:08.667
We know you're not
pals with the cops.

21:08.750 --> 21:11.542
But that needs
some explaining.

21:14.542 --> 21:16.625
I went there to protect her.

21:16.709 --> 21:20.458
Was this still out of
the goodness of your heart?

21:20.542 --> 21:23.458
Or did you have
something else in mind?

21:23.542 --> 21:26.542
- Like what?
- 'Young girls.'

21:26.625 --> 21:29.667
No money, no
family,
no nothing.

21:29.750 --> 21:31.959
Who better to get an off
the record piece of tail
from?

21:32.041 --> 21:33.709
(Will)
'But maybe Ana
wouldn't go for it.'

21:33.792 --> 21:36.291
Maybe she didn't think
a man of the cloth

21:36.375 --> 21:38.083
should be trying
to get in her pants.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.542
And maybe she
threatened to expose

21:39.625 --> 21:41.792
the big community hero
as a scumbag.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.542
Have I sinned in my past?

21:47.917 --> 21:50.917
Yes. We all have.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.125
Priests are supposed to aim
higher than the average
slob.

21:54.208 --> 21:56.875
My church is
in a war zone

21:56.959 --> 21:58.208
filled with
desperate people.

21:58.291 --> 22:00.875
They sin to stay alive.

22:00.959 --> 22:02.125
You want to do
some good for them?

22:02.208 --> 22:04.875
You get your hands dirty
if you have to!

22:04.959 --> 22:06.959
For the greater good.

22:07.041 --> 22:08.959
So it's okay
to hit on
her.

22:09.041 --> 22:10.625
I didn't.

22:10.709 --> 22:12.166
Not Ana.

22:12.250 --> 22:14.250
That girl brought out
the best in me.

22:17.709 --> 22:19.917
Talk about the motel.

22:23.667 --> 22:26.291
I got her out of there.

22:26.375 --> 22:28.417
Back to safety.

22:28.500 --> 22:32.417
At least for the night.

22:43.750 --> 22:45.542
I told Delia she would be okay.

22:50.166 --> 22:51.667
It wasn't your fault.

22:51.750 --> 22:53.959
But I knew she was
dying and I lied.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.000
It wasn't a lie.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.250
Shh.

22:59.041 --> 23:00.625
It wasn't a lie.

23:00.709 --> 23:02.750
'It was hope.'

23:15.125 --> 23:17.250
Ana, you have to leave.

23:18.458 --> 23:19.625
But you said
I'm safe here.

23:19.709 --> 23:21.458
Yes. For tonight.

23:21.542 --> 23:23.625
But he will come here tomorrow.

23:23.709 --> 23:26.417
- 'Looking for you.'
- He still has my passport.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.625
(Peralta)
'Forget that.'

23:29.542 --> 23:31.166
Forget going home?

23:40.333 --> 23:41.834
Then I'll find work here.

23:41.917 --> 23:43.458
I'll send money to Sofia
to bring her over.

23:43.542 --> 23:45.959
Ramiro will
find you
here.

23:47.583 --> 23:50.041
I have the pellets...maybe
I can--

23:50.125 --> 23:52.500
I can't help you with that.

23:52.583 --> 23:55.917
- They're worth a lot.
- Forget the drugs.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.166
'Forget the money.'

23:57.250 --> 23:59.500
'It's time for you
to save yourself.'

24:03.417 --> 24:04.458
<i>Que estas haciendo?</i>

24:07.417 --> 24:08.625
(Peralta)
'Okay.'

24:13.750 --> 24:16.333
Now we have to find
you
a place to stay.

24:21.917 --> 24:24.417
There is someone I can call.

24:34.792 --> 24:38.375
She used the rectory phone.

24:38.458 --> 24:40.166
'Left a few
minutes later.'

24:40.250 --> 24:41.458
Who'd she call?

24:41.542 --> 24:43.709
All I heard was his name.

24:43.792 --> 24:45.291
Alvaro.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.041
Alvaro.

24:52.125 --> 24:54.125
- Isn't that?
- Scotty.

24:54.208 --> 24:55.750
Yeah.

24:58.333 --> 24:59.750
What's up?

25:02.667 --> 25:04.542
Close the door, Scotty.

25:11.208 --> 25:14.834
We know you talked
to Ana later that night.

25:14.917 --> 25:16.667
No, I didn't.

25:16.750 --> 25:18.834
The priest
overheard a
conversation.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.875
I just said it didn't happen.

25:23.875 --> 25:27.208
Do you think
I'm lying to you,
boss?

25:27.291 --> 25:28.917
Lill?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.709
Why'd she have
your number, Scotty?

25:30.792 --> 25:33.542
My number?
No, she..

25:51.750 --> 25:54.375
[sighs]
It's because, um..

25:56.166 --> 25:58.041
...I screwed up.

26:03.709 --> 26:06.125
I got in with her.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.333
Those car trips.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.250
We'd talk.

26:14.417 --> 26:15.792
And..

26:16.917 --> 26:18.208
...she got into my head.

26:18.291 --> 26:20.792
Was she a girlfriend, Scotty?

26:20.875 --> 26:21.959
No.

26:22.041 --> 26:23.250
I didn't do that.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.166
'Look, she didn't
want much.'

26:25.250 --> 26:26.792
To get home to Colombia.

26:26.875 --> 26:30.125
Get a clerical job.
Put her sister in school.

26:30.208 --> 26:31.333
Did you tell her you were a cop?

26:31.417 --> 26:32.667
No, absolutely not.

26:32.750 --> 26:33.959
Did she know?

26:34.041 --> 26:36.750
She...figured me out.

26:38.542 --> 26:41.750
- I didn't deny it.
- Right.

26:45.166 --> 26:49.125
[sighs]
Look, I guess part of me
wanted her to know.

26:49.208 --> 26:54.291
Wanted her to...call me.
So I could save her.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.166
You drive fast.

27:09.250 --> 27:11.709
It's the only speed I know.

27:11.792 --> 27:13.667
You like the rush.

27:13.750 --> 27:16.000
- 'Don't you?'
- Nah.

27:16.083 --> 27:19.208
- What?
- Come on.

27:19.291 --> 27:22.417
When you're lying to
that
ball-buster customs cop

27:22.500 --> 27:26.166
and all those drug
dogs
are sniffing at you

27:26.250 --> 27:28.917
and then he finally
waves you on through

27:29.000 --> 27:30.709
how do you feel?

27:30.792 --> 27:32.375
- Great.
- Ah!

27:32.458 --> 27:34.125
Ah, it feels great.

27:34.208 --> 27:36.208
'Cause it's
a rush,
right?

27:36.291 --> 27:38.542
That's what
I'm talking
about.

27:38.625 --> 27:41.625
I pretend I'm someone else
when I talk to them.

27:41.709 --> 27:44.291
Someone who's not scared.

27:44.375 --> 27:46.792
And it works.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.792
You do the same thing?

27:52.917 --> 27:54.667
(Ana)
'I took your phone, Alvaro.'

27:54.750 --> 27:56.333
'Last trip.'

27:58.667 --> 28:00.500
I thought I'd lost it at work.

28:00.583 --> 28:04.250
I saw the names on it.
I know who you really are.

28:04.333 --> 28:06.041
- It makes sense.
- Ana.

28:06.125 --> 28:08.250
That you're more than
just this driver.

28:08.333 --> 28:11.000
Look, Ana, don't talk
about it. I mean it!

28:33.041 --> 28:34.959
Ready?

28:35.041 --> 28:36.750
Will you give me
your phone number?

28:36.834 --> 28:39.000
I can't.

28:39.083 --> 28:41.542
So this is goodbye, then.

28:44.792 --> 28:46.583
It's been good.

28:47.834 --> 28:49.000
Talking.

28:52.583 --> 28:54.458
'Be nice to
your girlfriend.'

28:54.542 --> 28:57.375
She won't wait till you're 40.

29:00.792 --> 29:02.500
Ana.

29:16.250 --> 29:19.041
Only if you're in trouble.

29:32.875 --> 29:37.000
Now you know why
I don't talk about it.

29:37.083 --> 29:39.291
I was no good.

29:40.750 --> 29:43.959
I didn't have the discipline
to not get involved.

29:44.041 --> 29:46.709
- You should've told us, Scotty.
- 'I didn't think it mattered.'

29:46.792 --> 29:50.000
I hoped it didn't matter,
'cause she never called.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.250
But she did call.

29:52.333 --> 29:53.875
I never talked to her.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.875
(John)
'What number
did you give her?'

29:56.959 --> 29:59.041
My undercover line at West.

29:59.125 --> 30:02.208
If you didn't answer it,
who did?

30:02.291 --> 30:05.875
Only could have been...my boss.

30:07.417 --> 30:08.875
Manny.

30:18.625 --> 30:20.166
- Hey, Manny.
- Hey!

30:20.250 --> 30:22.709
Something new
on the case?

30:22.792 --> 30:24.375
Yeah.

30:24.458 --> 30:26.083
Ana called me that night.

30:26.166 --> 30:28.250
And?

30:28.333 --> 30:30.208
And she got you.

30:30.291 --> 30:32.291
- What?
- Do not lie to me.

30:32.375 --> 30:34.041
The Cortez case is in, Manny.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.375
We can talk safely.

30:39.333 --> 30:41.750
Okay. Yeah.

30:41.834 --> 30:46.000
She called for Alvaro.
Said he gave her his number.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.917
I knew that had to be wrong

30:49.000 --> 30:51.417
'cause Scotty Valens wouldn't
make a dumb move like that.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.792
- How could you not tell me?
- How could I?

30:53.875 --> 30:55.417
You were protecting
the Cortez bust.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.875
That's right.

30:56.959 --> 30:59.834
That was our job, Scotty.
You took your eye off the
ball.

30:59.917 --> 31:01.208
Yeah, I did.

31:01.291 --> 31:02.583
She was a drug runner,
part of this operation

31:02.667 --> 31:03.583
we were trying to bring down.

31:03.667 --> 31:05.083
But you sent her to die, Manny!

31:05.166 --> 31:07.875
And I wouldn't have had
to if you didn't screw up!

31:11.083 --> 31:12.709
I was cleaning up your mess.

31:14.250 --> 31:16.417
What did you tell Ana
when she called?

31:16.500 --> 31:18.625
- I said no Alvaro here.
- She leave it at that?

31:18.709 --> 31:20.250
No, she said,
I know where the station is.

31:20.333 --> 31:22.208
- I'm coming there.
- Ana showed up at West?

31:22.291 --> 31:25.208
If she was seen there,
Cortez would've closed ranks

31:25.291 --> 31:26.959
'our bust would
have been screwed.'

31:27.041 --> 31:30.500
I had to head her off
at the pass.

31:38.834 --> 31:42.792
- Ana.
- Who are you?

31:42.875 --> 31:45.458
I talked to you
on the phone.

31:45.542 --> 31:48.208
I need Alvaro!

31:48.291 --> 31:50.458
- There's no Alvaro here.
- Please.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.834
There's a car
following me. It's him.

31:52.917 --> 31:54.917
- Who?
- Ramiro.

32:02.625 --> 32:04.041
You must have got
a wrong number.

32:04.125 --> 32:07.041
No! Alvaro knows me!

32:07.125 --> 32:09.500
Please! I'm trying
to stay alive!

32:09.583 --> 32:11.500
- I can't help you.
- Don't send me away.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.709
Arrest me!
Put me in jail!

32:13.792 --> 32:16.792
You'll be okay.
They're gone now.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.667
<i>Por favor.</i>

32:23.959 --> 32:25.542
Please.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.375
You think I wanted to do that?

32:42.458 --> 32:45.125
'Think I got no heart?'

32:45.208 --> 32:47.458
- No.
- 'Tough choices, Scotty.'

32:47.542 --> 32:51.250
You get your hands dirty
if you have to.

32:51.333 --> 32:53.583
For the greater good.

32:53.667 --> 32:55.542
You get a look
at this girl in the car?

32:55.625 --> 32:59.542
Yeah. Black hair,
blonde streaks, hopped
up.

33:38.750 --> 33:42.291
- Nice spot.
- I killed this girl.

33:44.375 --> 33:45.750
Come on.

33:45.834 --> 33:48.750
I shouldn't have done that job.

33:48.834 --> 33:50.458
I can't keep my boundaries.

33:50.542 --> 33:52.917
Look, you give a damn.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.166
Makes you a great cop
in most situations.

33:56.250 --> 33:58.542
I do this over and over.

33:58.625 --> 34:02.959
You saw me last year with
Christina, so damn...sloppy.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.750
You were screwed up last year.

34:05.834 --> 34:08.125
I wasn't screwed up in '98.

34:09.875 --> 34:12.291
If I'd just been...careful.

34:13.458 --> 34:15.959
- Kept things clean.
- What?

34:18.041 --> 34:21.792
A girl swallowing drugs
to get a better life..

34:21.875 --> 34:23.875
'...she was doomed.'

34:24.875 --> 34:27.667
You couldn't have saved her.

34:27.750 --> 34:29.625
I got bad habits.

34:31.166 --> 34:33.041
I got to change.

34:36.792 --> 34:39.417
So who was
driving
the car, Ceci?

34:39.500 --> 34:40.792
- Huh?
- The night Ana died.

34:40.875 --> 34:44.709
Blue SUV, headlights
off,
following her.

34:44.792 --> 34:46.291
You were in the passenger seat.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.875
- No. It wasn't me.
- That ain't gonna fly,
Ceci.

34:48.959 --> 34:50.500
A cop picked you
out of a photo
spread.

34:50.583 --> 34:52.667
You were a junkie,
and you knew Ana had

34:52.750 --> 34:54.083
two cookies somewhere.

34:54.166 --> 34:56.291
You'd been in that church
for two days without a fix.

34:56.375 --> 34:58.083
You'd have done
anything to get some.

34:58.166 --> 35:00.625
Two pellets of heroin would've
been worth following her for.

35:00.709 --> 35:03.500
- Worth killing for.
- No.

35:03.583 --> 35:05.208
Who was driving
the car?

35:05.291 --> 35:08.375
Talk about that,
maybe we make a deal.

35:11.792 --> 35:13.959
What kind of deal?

35:20.917 --> 35:22.542
Lighter sentence.

35:22.625 --> 35:25.000
- How light?
- Talk!

35:30.458 --> 35:32.417
My boyfriend.

35:36.583 --> 35:38.417
He have a habit too?

35:38.500 --> 35:40.208
I told him
she had two pellets

35:40.291 --> 35:42.166
and he said,
let's go find her.

35:42.250 --> 35:44.583
I was just trying
to get to Miami.

35:45.542 --> 35:47.291
The sun.

36:07.083 --> 36:08.375
Ana!

36:09.917 --> 36:11.333
[sighs]
Oh.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.417
I thought it was Ramiro!

36:15.500 --> 36:16.917
I saw you leave the church.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.125
- Ceci, I'm so scared.
- It's okay.

36:19.208 --> 36:20.417
My boyfriend will help us.

36:20.500 --> 36:21.959
We'll drive
all the way to Miami.

36:22.041 --> 36:23.875
[speaking Spanish]
Come on.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.250
Thank you, Ceci.

36:28.333 --> 36:30.959
- You have the cookies, right?
- No.

36:31.041 --> 36:33.750
- We have to get them.
- Forget it, it's too
dangerous.

36:33.834 --> 36:37.208
No, Ana. Where are they?

36:37.291 --> 36:38.583
No.

36:39.875 --> 36:41.917
You're the one who cut Delia.

36:44.333 --> 36:46.750
Tell us where they're at.

36:46.834 --> 36:48.792
I looked everywhere
you could've put them.

36:48.875 --> 36:51.709
- We need them, Ana.
- Oh, Ceci.

36:53.166 --> 36:55.208
Where are they?

36:55.291 --> 36:57.875
- What about Miami?
- 'We can go.'

36:57.959 --> 36:59.417
If you just tell us
where you--

36:59.500 --> 37:02.125
- You swallowed them.
- No.

37:02.208 --> 37:04.333
If they ain't at the church

37:04.417 --> 37:07.291
where else are they going to be?

37:07.375 --> 37:10.500
- I didn't swallow them.
- Yes, you did!

37:10.583 --> 37:13.792
You think that
we won't get them?

37:13.875 --> 37:17.208
Give them to us, Ana.
You know what can happen.

37:21.333 --> 37:23.291
You'll kill me.
