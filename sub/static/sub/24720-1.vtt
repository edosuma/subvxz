00:02.132 --> 00:03.264
Previously onElementary...

00:03.307 --> 00:04.003
My name is Sherlock,
and I'm an addict.

00:04.046 --> 00:05.005
Mr. Johnson, I presume?

00:05.048 --> 00:06.180
Call me Shinwell.

00:06.223 --> 00:08.660
So, a former drug dealer,
correct?

00:08.704 --> 00:09.922
Former drug user.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.015
You're sleeping.Hmm?

00:15.058 --> 00:16.538
You never sleep.
Are you okay?

00:16.581 --> 00:18.496
Whatever excuse you have,
it isn't good enough.

00:18.540 --> 00:19.671
It hasn't been good enough
for weeks.

00:19.715 --> 00:21.847
I forgot.You forgot? You?!

00:21.891 --> 00:24.024
Are you kidding me?!

00:24.067 --> 00:25.025
Tell me where you are.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.027
I'm close, Sherlock.

00:31.944 --> 00:33.033
[grunting]

00:33.076 --> 00:35.035
Sorry about
last night.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.862
You really didn't do anything.
It was me.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.560
You're not well.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.779
Why do you look like my mother?

00:40.823 --> 00:43.608
I'm the part of you
that wants to get better.

00:43.652 --> 00:45.349
Mr. Holmes?

00:45.393 --> 00:46.611
I'm ready for you now.

01:02.323 --> 01:04.325
[elevator bell chimes]

01:09.721 --> 01:11.245
We've talked about this.

01:11.288 --> 01:13.943
You don't get to go on the ride
till it's your turn.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.597
When it's my turn,
I won't really get

01:15.640 --> 01:17.033
the full experience.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.340
Oh, you want
the full experience.

01:19.383 --> 01:21.646
Stay there, I'll get my scalpel.

01:24.562 --> 01:25.737
What happened?

01:25.781 --> 01:29.089
Oh, I tore my Achilles.
Softball.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.220
You'd figure somebody
in my line of work

01:30.264 --> 01:31.221
would appreciate how fragile

01:31.265 --> 01:33.093
our bodies really are.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.051
So,

01:35.095 --> 01:37.140
to what do I owe the pleasure?

01:37.184 --> 01:38.663
Just waiting
for some test results.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.143
From me?

01:40.187 --> 01:41.405
Oh, no, someone else.

01:41.449 --> 01:42.319
And the reason you're
waiting on my table

01:42.363 --> 01:45.105
instead of one in your house?

01:45.148 --> 01:46.889
My mother's ghost recently

01:46.932 --> 01:48.456
set a room on fire,
so I've been doing

01:48.499 --> 01:49.152
most of my thinking elsewhere.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.807
Fine, don't tell me.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.591
[phone ringing]

01:57.378 --> 01:59.119
Sherlock Holmes.

02:01.077 --> 02:03.123
Thank you.
I'll be right there.

02:06.691 --> 02:07.953
Holmes?

02:07.997 --> 02:09.955
Something I can help with?

02:09.999 --> 02:12.001
Not yet.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.611
But if an autopsy
is in the offing,

02:13.655 --> 02:14.830
I should know soon enough.[elevator bell chimes]

02:30.802 --> 02:32.804
[breathing heavily, chuckling]

02:37.287 --> 02:38.680
[kissing]

02:40.812 --> 02:42.292
Damn it.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.310
[whoosh sound effect]

03:05.228 --> 03:07.187
[crickets chirping]

03:27.729 --> 03:29.383
[footsteps crunching]

03:38.392 --> 03:39.697
What the hell?

03:42.613 --> 03:46.095
â™ª

04:18.301 --> 04:21.216
Hey. Have you seen Sherlock?

04:21.261 --> 04:22.262
No. Everything all right?

04:22.305 --> 04:23.306
Well, he didn't
come home last night

04:23.350 --> 04:24.568
and he hasn't
returned my calls.

04:24.612 --> 04:25.656
Maybe he met someone.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.745
Or, knowing him,
someone,

04:27.789 --> 04:30.008
her two friends and
their pet tiger.

04:30.052 --> 04:32.097
[sighs]
Didn't know you were
coming in today.

04:32.141 --> 04:33.838
You here for a case?No case.

04:33.882 --> 04:35.318
I'm meeting some
new clients.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.972
The captain said I could
use the conference room.

04:37.015 --> 04:39.279
Sophie Bishop
and her husband.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.324
This about the sex tape?

04:42.369 --> 04:43.979
Well, I read about it.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.502
Someone put it up
on the Internet

04:45.546 --> 04:47.504
without her permission--
she's ticked off.

04:47.548 --> 04:50.028
All I know is they need
help finding someone.

04:50.072 --> 04:51.813
[elevator bell chimes]

04:54.729 --> 04:56.470
Don't pretend you
haven't seen her naked.

04:56.513 --> 04:57.775
Everyone's seen her naked.

04:57.819 --> 05:00.038
Not that I would
lead with that

05:00.082 --> 05:01.910
if I introduce you.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.522
SOPHIE:
His name's Sammy Olivetti.

05:05.566 --> 05:06.871
His info's all there, too.

05:06.915 --> 05:09.091
So this is the man in the video?

05:09.134 --> 05:10.614
Yeah.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.050
[door opens]

05:12.094 --> 05:13.574
Ms. Bishop, Mr. Hayes.

05:13.617 --> 05:16.316
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
Apologies for being late.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.752
Didn't get the message
that my partner left

05:17.795 --> 05:19.275
until a short while ago.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.930
Vernon Fisk.
I'm Ryan and Sophie's attorney.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.933
Yes. Please continue.

05:24.976 --> 05:27.152
Uh, Sammy played bass for a
band called the Pompeii Worms.

05:27.196 --> 05:30.808
They were hot for
a second in 2012.

05:30.852 --> 05:32.419
We were pretty
intense for a while.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.986
And that's when you made
the video, five years ago?

05:35.030 --> 05:37.685
Yeah. Until all this,
we'd barely spoken in years,

05:37.728 --> 05:39.339
mostly 'cause I got clean
before he did.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.905
But we were supposed
to meet him this morning,

05:40.949 --> 05:42.254
and he never showed up.

05:42.298 --> 05:43.995
I'm confused.
Isn't he the one

05:44.039 --> 05:46.215
who posted the video online?I know that's what
the news said,

05:46.258 --> 05:48.913
but it isn't true.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.567
The day the tape
showed up on the Internet,

05:50.611 --> 05:53.178
Sammy called me--
he was up in arms.

05:53.222 --> 05:54.832
He said that someone had
broken into his place

05:54.876 --> 05:56.660
a few days before, and
there was a copy of the tape

05:56.704 --> 05:58.401
with the stuff they took.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.360
RYAN: He was fighting with
the Web site to take it down.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.927
And he was trying
to find out who posted it.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.538
Our meeting this morning
was to...

06:04.581 --> 06:06.191
to talk about
legal action.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.846
I imagine that arguing
for tangible damages,

06:08.890 --> 06:11.283
in this case, might be
a challenge, wouldn't it?

06:11.327 --> 06:13.329
I mean, respectfully,

06:13.373 --> 06:14.939
you were the tabloids darling

06:14.983 --> 06:16.376
for many years...

06:16.419 --> 06:18.552
and given your antics
on the club scene,

06:18.595 --> 06:20.684
your propensity for
flashing the paparazzi,

06:20.728 --> 06:22.860
I think modesty might
be, uh, an option

06:22.904 --> 06:24.471
that you forfeited
some time ago.

06:24.514 --> 06:27.517
You're wrong about the damages
not being tangible.

06:27.561 --> 06:30.302
I mean, the release
of this video

06:30.346 --> 06:31.434
has cost my clients

06:31.478 --> 06:33.828
a virtual king's ransom.

06:33.871 --> 06:36.396
Now, understand, before
Sophie's grandfather died,

06:36.439 --> 06:39.311
he placed the bulk of his
real estate holdings in a trust,

06:39.355 --> 06:41.009
and he left strict instructions

06:41.052 --> 06:43.664
regarding Sophie's
eligibility

06:43.707 --> 06:45.753
for her share.
Now, one was

06:45.796 --> 06:48.364
that she had to get clean
and stay clean.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.192
And, two, if she was
ever an embarrassment

06:50.235 --> 06:51.759
to her family again,

06:51.802 --> 06:53.064
she'd be cut out.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.631
RYAN:
Thanks to this tape,

06:54.675 --> 06:57.112
the other trustees--
her brother, her aunts,

06:57.155 --> 06:59.070
the trust lawyer--

06:59.114 --> 07:00.376
they've triggered that clause.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.683
SOPHIE: I don't care
about the money.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.902
I-I worked hard to make amends,

07:04.946 --> 07:06.556
so I do care that
someone's ruining that,

07:06.600 --> 07:08.210
and I'd like to know
who and why.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.517
But I'm here because
I'm worried about Sammy.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.388
WATSON:
Mr. Hayes, I have to ask.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.911
A former lover
of your wife's

07:13.955 --> 07:15.522
comes back into your lives.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.741
A video surfaces
of them having sex.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.134
How does that make you feel?

07:21.571 --> 07:24.879
You know, I knew I was
marrying Sophie Bishop.

07:24.922 --> 07:26.402
[chuckles]

07:26.446 --> 07:28.448
I never knew her
in her Page Six days,

07:28.491 --> 07:31.755
but we met after
she got clean,

07:31.799 --> 07:34.454
and... we don't have
any secrets.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.760
We've shared every detail

07:36.804 --> 07:38.893
of each other's histories
with one another.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.503
She told me about
the tape years ago.

07:40.547 --> 07:43.637
I told her I may have made
a tape or two in my day.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.987
Did we think any
of these would ever

07:46.030 --> 07:46.988
end up online?

07:47.031 --> 07:48.990
No, but...

07:49.033 --> 07:51.732
it is what it is.

07:51.775 --> 07:55.126
Sammy was trying
to make things right.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.172
Now we can't find him.Did you check his home?

07:57.215 --> 07:59.609
We thought of that.
We, uh, went to the house.

07:59.653 --> 08:03.134
The landlady, actually,
let us in-- he wasn't there.

08:03.178 --> 08:06.137
Yeah, the cops won't
do anything.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.226
They say Sammy's a grown man,
and it hasn't even been

08:08.270 --> 08:10.185
a full day,
but I'm telling you

08:10.228 --> 08:11.534
this isn't like him.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.014
Something's happened.

08:14.276 --> 08:16.670
Please help.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.290
Well, I suppose I'll see
which mobile carrier

08:28.333 --> 08:30.118
services this number,
see if I can persuade

08:30.161 --> 08:33.121
one of my contacts to
ping Mr. Olivetti's phone.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.427
That's great.
In the meantime,

08:35.471 --> 08:37.255
you can finally tell me what
happened to the guest room.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.736
You're right, I owe you
an explanation.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.999
Yeah.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.653
Uh, for personal
and professional reasons,

08:43.697 --> 08:45.568
I'd rather not have
that discussion here.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.265
I bet you wouldn't.
You know,

08:47.309 --> 08:48.571
you've been acting
like such a jerk

08:48.615 --> 08:50.225
since Shinwell died.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.836
And when I called you on it,
what was your response?

08:52.880 --> 08:54.925
Avoiding me for weeks.Watson.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.232
No, we're not doing this
on your terms.

08:57.275 --> 08:58.799
You want to talk,
that's fine.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.365
There's an open room
right here.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.585
I'm not well.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.981
I'll tell you everything,

09:07.024 --> 09:08.548
just not here.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.203
Six weeks ago,

09:12.247 --> 09:13.857
I experienced my first symptom--

09:13.901 --> 09:15.685
a headache.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.644
It's unusual for me,
but it's not unheard of,

09:17.687 --> 09:19.950
so I dismissed it.

09:19.994 --> 09:22.997
More symptoms followed--
bouts of dizziness,

09:23.040 --> 09:26.217
memory loss, sensitivity
to noise and bright lights,

09:26.261 --> 09:28.568
uncharacteristic
need for sleep.

09:28.611 --> 09:32.006
The headaches grew more frequent

09:32.049 --> 09:34.051
and more painful.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.792
And I did all of that
in the throes

09:35.836 --> 09:38.360
of a particularly
vivid hallucination.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.235
I'm a doctor.
You could have told me.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.846
Well, I thought it would pass.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.412
It didn't.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.545
So, eventually I went
for an MRI.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.677
And?

09:50.720 --> 09:52.243
It was negative.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.723
That is to say,
there were no, um,

09:53.767 --> 09:57.335
no abnormal structures,
no bleeds, no tumors.

09:57.379 --> 10:00.251
Imagine the indignity of being
told that my brain is normal.

10:00.295 --> 10:03.167
So, more tests followed.

10:03.211 --> 10:05.561
Other scans, X-rays,
blood tests,

10:05.605 --> 10:07.258
all to rule out
the various diseases

10:07.302 --> 10:08.695
which could account
for my symptoms.

10:08.738 --> 10:11.872
And all were negative.

10:11.915 --> 10:15.397
Well, what do they think
the problem is?

10:15.440 --> 10:18.443
I have something called
post-concussion syndrome.

10:18.487 --> 10:19.662
PCS.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.446
Are you familiar?

10:21.490 --> 10:24.449
Shinwell, when he hit you
with that bottle.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.538
That was likely the final straw.

10:26.582 --> 10:29.672
But many of my life choices
leading up to this moment

10:29.716 --> 10:31.718
are likely factors-- the boxing,

10:31.761 --> 10:34.285
the continually putting myself
in harm's way...

10:34.329 --> 10:35.765
heroin.

10:35.809 --> 10:39.813
All of them have likely
contributed to this moment.

10:40.988 --> 10:43.207
So, as for what to expect,

10:43.251 --> 10:45.775
the doctor is loath
to make any promises.

10:45.819 --> 10:48.648
Things could get worse
before they get better.

10:48.691 --> 10:52.477
He's putting together
a regimen to aid in my recovery,

10:52.521 --> 10:53.783
but, uh...

10:53.827 --> 10:57.047
whether that recovery
takes weeks or months

10:57.091 --> 10:59.397
or, uh...

10:59.441 --> 11:03.575
if I'll even get better
at all...

11:03.619 --> 11:06.187
he couldn't say.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.809
Stand up.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.942
Excuse me?Stand up.

11:34.389 --> 11:37.261
My personality
hasn't changed, Watson.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.959
[phone chimes]

11:43.790 --> 11:46.357
It's my contact
at the cell phone company.

11:46.401 --> 11:50.884
He says Sammy Olivetti's
cell phone never left his house.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.327
Thanks. We'll let you know
when we're done.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.286
So, I pulled the report

12:02.330 --> 12:04.854
on the break-in
that Sophie told us about.

12:04.898 --> 12:07.248
Whoever did it kicked
the door until it opened.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.902
You can still see
the repairs.

12:10.817 --> 12:13.123
The deadbolt wasn't engaged
at the time.

12:13.167 --> 12:16.736
If it had been...
there'd be much more damage.

12:16.779 --> 12:19.564
Well, Sammy told the police
that he hardly ever used it.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.131
You can tell.

12:21.175 --> 12:23.133
The paint suggests
it's been here for years,

12:23.177 --> 12:25.135
but, um,
there's very little wear.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.224
You'd think he would have
developed better habits

12:27.268 --> 12:29.096
after being burglarized.

12:29.139 --> 12:33.491
Yeah, well, Sammy's brain was
not the organ he was known for.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.756
Do you smell that?

12:38.192 --> 12:39.715
A plastic.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.673
Phthalate.
A chemical compound

12:41.717 --> 12:45.025
off-gassed by new plastic,
quite a lot of it.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.505
I don't see a source.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.645
So, you didn't want to talk

12:56.688 --> 12:58.560
about your diagnosis
at the precinct,

12:58.603 --> 13:01.519
and I assume that's because you
don't want the captain to know?

13:01.563 --> 13:04.479
He already knows
I'm a recovering drug addict.

13:04.522 --> 13:07.090
I don't want to tell him
I'm also recovering

13:07.134 --> 13:09.397
from brain trauma.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.878
What, you're worried
he might bench you?

13:11.921 --> 13:15.838
Well, it's actually none
of his concern.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.623
My diagnosis is my diagnosis.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.931
So I'll deal with it the same
way I would any other problem.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.324
I have to say,

13:23.367 --> 13:24.934
you're taking it really well.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.457
What is it?

13:26.501 --> 13:28.285
There's tape residue.

13:28.329 --> 13:31.680
There's no dust,
so it's still fresh.

13:34.335 --> 13:36.772
Here.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.121
That's why we smell plastic.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.819
Someone covered
the walls with it.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.690
And the floor.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.215
â™ª

14:01.579 --> 14:04.278
I'd say that was blood,

14:04.321 --> 14:06.149
wouldn't you?

14:07.803 --> 14:10.153
Yeah. And I'd say
Sophie Bishop was right

14:10.197 --> 14:12.590
to be worried
about her ex.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.553
[phone rings]

14:20.555 --> 14:21.904
Hello.

14:21.948 --> 14:24.167
[filtered voice]:
Is this Sherlock Holmes?

14:24.211 --> 14:25.995
It is.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.910
I'm aware of the matter
you're looking into.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.086
I'm aware of you,
your reputation.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.915
Sophie Bishop and Ryan Hayes
are paying you your rate

14:32.959 --> 14:34.525
to find their friend.

14:34.569 --> 14:37.833
I'll pay you $1 million
to walk away.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.487
It's an interesting offer.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.706
I'm just gonna put you on hold

14:41.750 --> 14:44.057
while I discuss it
with my partner.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.367
Who are you texting?

14:50.411 --> 14:52.500
I'd say $1 million was
a bit low, wouldn't you?

14:52.543 --> 14:53.631
What?

14:53.675 --> 14:55.590
Hello?

14:55.633 --> 14:56.896
Yes.She's interested,

14:56.939 --> 14:58.941
but she thinks
that you can do better.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.029
We want $5 million.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.596
Five?I just texted you the number

15:01.639 --> 15:03.990
of an account I maintain
for these situations.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.556
Wire the money,
we'll drop the case.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.384
But wait...

15:07.428 --> 15:10.257
Okay, you said that you've been
experiencing hallucinations?

15:12.041 --> 15:13.608
Is that what's happening
right now?

15:13.651 --> 15:15.436
Do I look
like I'm hallucinating?

15:15.479 --> 15:16.916
What the hell did you just do?[phone beeps]

15:20.093 --> 15:22.312
I just made us $5 million.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.104
You took a bribe?$5 million.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.453
$5 million?

15:32.496 --> 15:33.802
He initially offered one,

15:33.845 --> 15:35.630
but I nudged him up to five.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.284
You're messing with me.

15:37.327 --> 15:39.025
That's not even
our personal record.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.027
You might recall
that Taiwanese operatives

15:41.070 --> 15:42.724
once offered us $50 million

15:42.767 --> 15:44.769
to insure the Imperial Jade Seal
ended up in their hands

15:44.813 --> 15:46.597
and not China's.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.425
Yeah, I remember you turned
them down, but you didn't

15:48.469 --> 15:50.297
turn down the guy
who called yesterday.

15:50.340 --> 15:53.778
I assumed, correctly, that he
was calling from a burner phone.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.650
Accepting his bribe
has given us another

15:55.693 --> 15:57.304
potential opportunity
to identify him,

15:57.347 --> 15:58.958
and that's why I'm here.

15:59.001 --> 16:02.700
This is the account that
the money was transferred to.

16:02.744 --> 16:05.486
I'd ask that you set CCS
to the task

16:05.529 --> 16:07.140
of tracking it back
to its source.

16:07.183 --> 16:09.359
Any luck, it'll be enough
to identify our killer.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.231
We don't even know
if Sammy Olivetti is dead.

16:11.274 --> 16:13.146
There's no body.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.843
There's no plastic sheeting,
either, but I'm confident

16:14.886 --> 16:16.323
that a few hundred
square foot of it

16:16.366 --> 16:18.368
was used to splatter-proof
his living room.

16:18.412 --> 16:21.241
You don't put that much tarp
down to give a man a haircut.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.156
There's also the blood
that we found

16:23.199 --> 16:25.375
and the small matter
of the $5 million.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.769
If Mr. Olivetti isn't dead, he's
doing a very good impression.

16:27.812 --> 16:31.686
I'll let you know
what CCS turns up.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.166
You gonna be working here?

16:33.209 --> 16:35.081
No. I'm gonna pay
a visit to the man

16:35.124 --> 16:37.387
who's most likely
to have lined my pockets.

16:37.431 --> 16:46.005
[door closes]

16:46.048 --> 16:48.790
Mr. Bishop.
Hi, my name's Sherlock Holmes.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.705
I'm a detective.
I've been hired by your sister.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.141
Who let you in here?

16:52.185 --> 16:53.795
I think his name was Tyrone.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.101
Yes, Tyrone.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.450
Gave me his hat.

16:56.493 --> 16:57.973
I convinced him
I was an inspector

16:58.017 --> 16:59.540
with the buildings department.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.281
I do actually see a number
of code violations.

17:01.324 --> 17:02.673
But I'd much rather
talk to you about

17:02.717 --> 17:04.719
your sister's
missing ex-boyfriend.

17:04.762 --> 17:05.936
Look, you...It's okay, it's okay. I'll-I'll

17:05.981 --> 17:08.896
catch up with you in a minute.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.333
My sister has a lot
of ex-boyfriends.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.682
Which one is missing?

17:11.726 --> 17:14.294
Sammy Olivetti.
Tall, tattoos,

17:14.337 --> 17:16.557
phallus to make
a Clydesdale blush.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.428
The one from the tape.The one from the tape.

17:18.472 --> 17:21.605
Yeah.
Two nights ago,
he vanished.

17:21.648 --> 17:24.042
[chuckles] And you think I had
something to do with that?

17:24.086 --> 17:26.915
What, he besmirched my sister,
so I took my revenge?

17:26.958 --> 17:28.089
My sister's a drug addict.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.657
And a whore.

17:29.700 --> 17:32.007
A tape like that surfacing--
just a matter of time.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.184
Sammy was looking for the person
who stole the sex tape

17:35.228 --> 17:38.100
and put it online.
Was it you?

17:38.144 --> 17:40.015
Yesterday
someone offered me

17:40.059 --> 17:43.149
$5 million to stop looking
for Sammy Olivetti.

17:43.192 --> 17:45.673
That's just a drop in the ocean
to a man like you.

17:45.716 --> 17:47.240
Yeah, yeah, it is.

17:47.283 --> 17:48.893
But, unlike my sister,

17:48.937 --> 17:50.634
I actually care
about the Bishop name.

17:50.678 --> 17:53.376
I know she claims to be
"embarrassed" by that tape,

17:53.420 --> 17:56.988
but I assure you, no one was
more embarrassed than my family.

17:57.032 --> 17:59.991
The proliferation of the tape
resulted in her removal

18:00.035 --> 18:01.732
from the family trust.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.560
That meant more money for you.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.171
She ended up with nothing.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.869
Before I have you thrown
out of here on your ass,

18:07.912 --> 18:10.393
I think there's a few things
that you need to understand.

18:10.437 --> 18:13.788
[loud construction noise]One, Sophie hardly
left with nothing.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.356
[muffled]: And the $3 million
she was getting each year...

18:16.399 --> 18:18.227
[noise continuing]

18:19.924 --> 18:22.710
[high-pitched tone humming]

18:22.753 --> 18:23.711
Hey.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.974
What the hell is wrong with you?

18:27.802 --> 18:29.847
Hey. Are you even
listening to me?

18:29.891 --> 18:31.588
Hey!

18:32.894 --> 18:34.722
Hey!

18:34.765 --> 18:36.898
You're sure
someone hurt Sammy?

18:36.941 --> 18:39.422
No, we're not sure. But the
evidence we found at his house

18:39.466 --> 18:42.033
is hard to ignore.
It's even harder to ignore

18:42.077 --> 18:44.384
that someone was willing
to pay us $5 million

18:44.427 --> 18:45.776
to look the other way.

18:47.082 --> 18:48.170
It wasn't my brother.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.780
Sophie...

18:49.824 --> 18:51.913
No, I-I know Drew and I have had
problems in the past,

18:51.956 --> 18:54.089
but it wasn't him.
He wouldn't do this.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.222
He's a creep,
but he's not a killer.

18:56.265 --> 18:58.920
If we're right about him,
he didn't set out to kill Sammy;

18:58.963 --> 19:01.096
he did it because
Sammy was on his trail.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.925
No, and I-I don't want you and
your partner telling people that

19:03.968 --> 19:06.319
you think Drew did this. I've
embarrassed my family enough.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.190
Let's talk about
your family.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.713
If Drew didn't do this,
is there anyone else

19:09.757 --> 19:11.150
you can think of
who might have...What part of

19:11.193 --> 19:12.412
"I don't want
to embarrass my family"

19:12.455 --> 19:14.022
do you not understand?

19:14.065 --> 19:16.024
The night that
Sammy disappeared,

19:16.067 --> 19:18.505
he sent an e-mail to
a video sharing site

19:18.548 --> 19:19.897
where your tape first appeared.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.464
He'd been trying for weeks

19:21.508 --> 19:23.814
to get information
to help identify the person

19:23.858 --> 19:25.990
who posted it. I followed up
with them this morning.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.862
All they could tell me
was that the video

19:27.905 --> 19:29.733
was uploaded at a coffee shop

19:29.777 --> 19:31.692
in New Brunswick, New Jersey
called the Buzz House.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.737
Does that mean
anything to you?

19:35.870 --> 19:37.001
Sophie?

19:38.264 --> 19:40.309
No.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.964
No, I'm sorry,
it doesn't mean anything.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.184
Uh...

19:45.227 --> 19:47.229
thanks for coming out here.

19:47.273 --> 19:50.276
If anything else comes up,
you have my info.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.932
HOLMES: Well, I've always
rebelled at stagnation.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.847
So, a little over a year ago,

19:56.891 --> 19:59.154
I-I, uh, I sat in a room
just like this one

19:59.198 --> 20:02.505
and I said that I was,
I was bored.

20:02.549 --> 20:05.116
I'd grown tired of meetings.

20:05.160 --> 20:10.905
Uh, just-just tired of
the daily task of staying sober.

20:10.948 --> 20:15.039
I'd come to believe
that in order for me

20:15.083 --> 20:16.476
to stay committed
to my sobriety,

20:16.519 --> 20:20.001
I-I needed to challenge it.

20:20.044 --> 20:24.397
So... I stopped going
to meetings, and...

20:24.440 --> 20:28.575
I put myself into situations
that I shouldn't have.

20:28.618 --> 20:32.274
Recently, events have
conspired to, uh,

20:32.318 --> 20:35.277
give me all of the challenges
I could ever need.

20:37.061 --> 20:42.023
Um, and boredom is a,
is a, is a distant memory.

20:44.068 --> 20:46.375
Guess the old adage is true,
isn't it?

20:46.419 --> 20:48.899
Careful what you wish for.

20:54.470 --> 20:57.560
Hey, uh, Sherlock?

20:57.604 --> 20:59.736
I'm sorry I didn't get
to speak in there.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.521
Hey, uh, my name's Michael.

21:01.564 --> 21:05.220
Hello.
You probably
wouldn't remember me,

21:05.264 --> 21:08.049
but, uh, we used to go
to some of the same meetings.

21:08.092 --> 21:10.312
Um, the last time I saw you
at one was

21:10.356 --> 21:12.793
four years, ten months
and 16 days ago.

21:12.836 --> 21:16.013
That's very
strangely specific.
Yeah.

21:16.057 --> 21:18.059
Uh, it's actually
the last time I used.

21:18.102 --> 21:20.888
Um, you know,
I was new to it back then,

21:20.931 --> 21:23.064
and the meetings weren't
helping, nothing made sense.

21:23.107 --> 21:27.634
But then I heard you speak
one night, and it really helped.

21:27.677 --> 21:30.245
Oh, what did I say?

21:30.289 --> 21:32.203
"My mind is like
a racing engine,

21:32.247 --> 21:35.729
"tearing itself to pieces,
because it's not connected up

21:35.772 --> 21:38.079
to the work for which
it was built."

21:38.122 --> 21:40.342
Sorry.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.257
I actually wrote that down.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.086
But you talked about rehab
and how you struggled there,

21:45.129 --> 21:48.002
and you said you were made
for one thing,

21:48.045 --> 21:52.093
and being away from it made
staying sober almost impossible.

21:52.136 --> 21:54.051
But when you got out,
you went back to it,

21:54.095 --> 21:55.879
and that made
all the difference.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.752
So I actually decided
to do the same thing,

21:58.795 --> 22:02.277
you know, focus on my work,
use it to get better.

22:02.321 --> 22:06.586
Four years, ten months,
16 days later...

22:06.629 --> 22:11.025
I worked hard, but, uh...
it started with you.

22:12.418 --> 22:15.029
Glad to hear
you're doing well.

22:15.072 --> 22:18.424
Hey, the challenge you were
talking about in there--

22:18.467 --> 22:21.514
uh, have you talked
to your sponsor about it?

22:21.557 --> 22:23.951
Actually between
sponsors at the moment.

22:23.994 --> 22:28.347
Well, look, if you ever need
someone to talk to, uh,

22:28.390 --> 22:30.305
call me.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.308
You helped me.
Maybe I could return the favor.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.092
Thanks.

22:37.181 --> 22:39.706
[door opens]

22:39.749 --> 22:42.230
Hey, did you see the text
from the captain?

22:42.273 --> 22:43.797
Yup. CCS was able

22:43.840 --> 22:45.973
to trace our bribe
to an anonymous,

22:46.016 --> 22:47.453
off-shore account
and no further.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.193
So, it's as much a dead end

22:49.237 --> 22:51.370
as the burner phone
used to contact us.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.372
How'd it go with
Sophie's brother?

22:53.415 --> 22:55.156
We had a rather
one-sided conversation

22:55.199 --> 22:57.332
at one of his
construction sites.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.553
What do you mean?I mean, it was noisy there.
It was so noisy, in fact,

23:00.596 --> 23:03.294
that by the time he finally had
something interesting to say,

23:03.338 --> 23:04.905
I experienced
a piercing headache

23:04.948 --> 23:07.908
and a ringing in my ears which
rendered me virtually deaf.

23:07.951 --> 23:09.431
Couldn't hear a word he said.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.912
The PCS?

23:11.955 --> 23:14.393
Yeah, perhaps, yes.

23:16.046 --> 23:18.266
Well, I'll... I'll go see him
myself tomorrow.

23:18.309 --> 23:19.876
Well, I said
I couldn't hear him.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.009
I didn't say I couldn't
understand what he said.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.968
So you read his lips?He confirmed

23:25.012 --> 23:28.102
that his sister was cut out
of the family trust,

23:28.145 --> 23:31.671
but he also claimed that her
expulsion triggered a buyout.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.020
A buyout?

23:33.063 --> 23:34.717
Grandpa Bishop, it seems,

23:34.761 --> 23:36.632
thought that sending Sophie
straight to the gutter

23:36.676 --> 23:38.504
would bring even more shame
upon the family,

23:38.547 --> 23:40.331
so instead,
he devised a punishment

23:40.375 --> 23:41.724
which would only be understood

23:41.768 --> 23:44.248
by the top one percent
of the top one percent.

23:44.292 --> 23:47.426
Instead of her receiving
$3 million every year

23:47.469 --> 23:49.297
for the rest of her life,
as well

23:49.340 --> 23:51.386
as a continued stake
in the family interests,

23:51.430 --> 23:53.301
she receive a one-time buyout

23:53.344 --> 23:55.346
of $60 million.

23:55.390 --> 23:57.174
Her brother said he was
in the process of trying

23:57.218 --> 23:59.960
to annul that clause when the
sex tape first surfaced online.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.614
I confirmed that.

24:01.657 --> 24:04.486
So, if he had been the one
who stole the tape...

24:04.530 --> 24:05.879
He would've waited to post it

24:05.922 --> 24:07.707
until Sophie was in line
to get nothing.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.491
Well, for what
it's worth,

24:09.535 --> 24:12.233
Sophie doesn't think her
brother's guilty, either.

24:12.276 --> 24:13.930
Did she have
a more likely suspect?

24:13.974 --> 24:16.411
Mostly, she was trying to wrap
her head around the things

24:16.455 --> 24:18.500
that we found at Sammy's
house, but when I told her

24:18.544 --> 24:21.503
the video was uploaded at a
coffee shop in New Brunswick,

24:21.547 --> 24:24.114
that definitely meant
something to her.

24:24.158 --> 24:26.726
So, do you want to talk

24:26.769 --> 24:29.076
about what happened
at the construction site?

24:29.119 --> 24:30.730
Actually, Watson,
I need to succumb

24:30.773 --> 24:32.775
to another symptom
of my condition.

24:32.819 --> 24:35.474
I'm tired.
I have to go to sleep.

24:47.964 --> 24:50.445
[phone ringing]

24:51.577 --> 24:53.317
Hey.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.755
BELL:
I'm afraid I'm not calling
with good news.

24:55.798 --> 24:57.147
What's wrong?

24:57.191 --> 24:58.758
It's Sophie Bishop.

24:58.801 --> 25:01.151
She's dead.

25:08.115 --> 25:09.682
Detectives from the 116
notified the next of kin

25:09.725 --> 25:11.205
a little while ago.
Her husband said

25:11.248 --> 25:13.642
she got a call around 5:00
that seemed to rattle her.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.514
She grabbed her car keys,
ran out the door.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.167
Wouldn't tell him
where she was going.

25:17.211 --> 25:18.560
This is her phone.

25:18.604 --> 25:21.084
CSU found it
in her car over there.

25:21.128 --> 25:23.739
[garbled radio transmission]

25:26.394 --> 25:28.831
The call she got--
it's from the same number

25:28.875 --> 25:30.746
that called me and
Sherlock yesterday.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.444
I noticed. Got to think
whoever tried to bribe you

25:33.488 --> 25:35.882
convinced her to come out here
for some sort of meeting.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.361
Either things went south,

25:37.405 --> 25:40.147
or he was planning
to kill her all along.

25:40.190 --> 25:42.976
Maybe.

25:43.019 --> 25:44.630
You got another theory?

25:44.673 --> 25:46.762
Yeah. We do.

25:46.806 --> 25:48.547
[sirens blaring]

25:48.590 --> 25:50.984
This is so ridiculous.

25:51.027 --> 25:53.900
Why would you think
I killed Sophie?

25:53.943 --> 25:55.641
I idolized her.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.468
Well, you did seem

25:57.512 --> 25:59.383
like a loving couple
the other day.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.690
Perhaps at one point,
you did love her.

26:01.734 --> 26:04.171
But love's hold
can wane, can't it?

26:04.214 --> 26:07.740
Much more reliable
motivator is $60 million.

26:07.783 --> 26:09.480
GREGSON:
As in the $60 million

26:09.524 --> 26:13.441
buyout you and your wife
received from her family trust.

26:13.484 --> 26:16.618
So you think
I killed Sophie for the money.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.011
We think you did
more than that.

26:18.054 --> 26:19.926
You stole the sex tape

26:19.969 --> 26:22.493
starring your wife and Sammy
Olivetti, and you leaked it

26:22.537 --> 26:24.365
in order to trigger the buyout.

26:24.408 --> 26:25.975
GREGSON:
You're the one who
bribed Mr. Holmes

26:26.019 --> 26:28.195
to stop investigating,
am I right?

26:28.238 --> 26:30.763
I don't know anything
about any bribe.

26:30.806 --> 26:32.547
According to your
cell phone records,

26:32.591 --> 26:36.507
you've been in regular contact
with a divorce attorney

26:36.551 --> 26:39.119
the last couple of months.HOLMES:
Safe to assume

26:39.162 --> 26:40.816
it wouldn't have worked
out well for you financially

26:40.860 --> 26:42.775
if you'd have left the
marriage as it was.

26:42.818 --> 26:46.039
But with Sophie $60 million
richer before the divorce,

26:46.082 --> 26:49.129
you'd get a nice soft
landing, wouldn't you?

26:49.172 --> 26:51.218
GREGSON:
The sex tape was uploaded
from a coffee shop

26:51.261 --> 26:52.654
in New Brunswick
three weeks ago.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.047
We talked to your secretary.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.526
She said you had been looking

26:55.570 --> 26:57.050
at an investment property
down there.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.791
Now, according
to the E-Z Pass records,

26:58.834 --> 27:00.880
you were there
the day the video was loaded.

27:00.923 --> 27:03.752
When my partner
mentioned New Brunswick

27:03.796 --> 27:05.885
to your wife,
it meant something to her.

27:05.928 --> 27:08.061
Would I be right in saying
that she knew

27:08.104 --> 27:09.584
about your business
dealings there?

27:09.628 --> 27:11.325
GREGSON:
What happened?
She realized what

27:11.368 --> 27:12.935
you had done,
and she confronted you,

27:12.979 --> 27:15.242
threatened to go to the police,
so you strangled her?

27:15.285 --> 27:18.462
HOLMES:
From there, the scenario
is easy enough to construct.

27:18.506 --> 27:20.421
You dialed her using
the same burner phone

27:20.464 --> 27:23.163
you used to contact me,
thereby supporting the story

27:23.206 --> 27:24.904
that you planned
to tell the police:

27:24.947 --> 27:27.733
that she'd received a
call before rushing out.

27:27.776 --> 27:29.125
A call that they would recognize

27:29.169 --> 27:31.693
as coming from the
phantom briber.

27:31.737 --> 27:34.087
You then drove her
body, using her car,

27:34.130 --> 27:35.741
to the spot where
they were found,

27:35.784 --> 27:37.307
and then you made
your own way home.

27:37.351 --> 27:38.918
Tell us what you did
with Olivetti's body.

27:38.961 --> 27:41.790
We'll relay your cooperation
to the D.A.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.749
and emphasize
that we don't think

27:43.792 --> 27:46.882
that the murder of your wife
was premeditated.

27:50.190 --> 27:52.627
You're right...

27:52.671 --> 27:54.455
that I leaked the video.

27:54.498 --> 27:58.459
But that is all
you are right about.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.940
I had nothing to do
with Sammy's murder,

28:00.983 --> 28:03.464
and I sure as hell
didn't kill my wife.

28:05.553 --> 28:08.643
Sophie was in on it, okay?

28:08.687 --> 28:12.038
We planned to leak the video
together to get the $60 million.

28:12.081 --> 28:15.084
The money she was getting
annually wasn't cutting it.

28:15.128 --> 28:17.521
I already told you--
I only knew the video existed

28:17.565 --> 28:19.132
because she told me about it.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.960
GREGSON: Pretty convenient story

28:21.003 --> 28:23.397
now that Sophie's
not around to argue.

28:23.440 --> 28:27.009
Maybe so...

28:27.053 --> 28:28.619
but it's the truth.

28:30.186 --> 28:34.582
You guys want to arrest me...
go ahead.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.237
If I'm right, the worst I'm
looking at is a burglary charge

28:37.280 --> 28:39.021
for when I stole the video,

28:39.065 --> 28:41.545
and maybe a civil suit
from the Bishops.

28:41.589 --> 28:45.506
I'm pretty sure my lawyer
will have me out by lunch.

28:48.030 --> 28:50.554
[door opens]

28:50.598 --> 28:52.078
[door closes]

28:52.121 --> 28:54.080
Hey. Marcus and I just
talked to the lawyer

28:54.123 --> 28:57.866
who manages the Bishop family
trust. You were right.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.476
If Ryan had just
filed for divorce,

28:59.520 --> 29:01.827
he would not be entitled
to any future share.

29:01.870 --> 29:04.525
But with the payout already
made and Sophie dead,

29:04.568 --> 29:06.179
he gets to keep the $60 million.

29:06.222 --> 29:08.747
Unless we can prove
that he killed her.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.884
Is everything okay?

29:15.928 --> 29:19.018
I can't remember why
I entered this room.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.240
Uh, uh, I was downstairs
in your office,

29:24.284 --> 29:26.025
looking at a map,
trying to determine

29:26.068 --> 29:30.246
where Hayes might have disposed
of Olivetti's body, and, um...

29:30.290 --> 29:32.596
I was also thinking

29:32.640 --> 29:35.425
we need to bring someone in
to repair the guest room.

29:35.469 --> 29:38.864
Which of those thoughts
impelled me up the stairs?

29:38.907 --> 29:40.691
Your guess is as good as mine.

29:40.735 --> 29:43.346
Might have even solved the case.

29:43.390 --> 29:46.045
We'll never know now, will we?

29:46.088 --> 29:49.004
Well, we all walk into rooms
sometimes and forget why.

29:49.048 --> 29:50.571
It happens to everyone.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.965
Not to me it doesn't.

30:07.240 --> 30:10.373
[chuckles]
You praised me yesterday
for taking this all so well.

30:10.417 --> 30:12.245
I-I'm really not.

30:13.768 --> 30:16.292
That's okay.
I know how scary this is.

30:18.294 --> 30:20.079
See, when I first began
going in for tests,

30:20.122 --> 30:22.385
I-I did my own research
as to the...

30:22.429 --> 30:24.779
the diagnoses
I might ultimately hear.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.737
I separated them
into two categories:

30:26.781 --> 30:28.217
something
that would kill me quickly--

30:28.261 --> 30:30.089
an aggressive cancer
or something like that--

30:30.132 --> 30:33.092
and a condition
which might permanently hinder

30:33.135 --> 30:34.920
my cognitive abilities.

30:34.963 --> 30:37.052
Between those two options,

30:37.096 --> 30:38.793
I hoped for a quick death.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.926
A man
approached me

30:40.969 --> 30:42.318
at a meeting yesterday.
Apparently,

30:42.362 --> 30:44.146
I-I helped him once
when I described...

30:44.190 --> 30:49.108
[chuckles] how integral my work
was to maintaining my sobriety.

30:49.151 --> 30:51.414
When all's said
and done,

30:51.458 --> 30:53.286
it's entirely possible
I'm going to be unfit

30:53.329 --> 30:55.331
to continue that work.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.814
That rattles me.

30:59.858 --> 31:03.252
The doctor said the
damage wasn't permanent.

31:03.296 --> 31:06.125
He said that you needed a
regimen for your recovery.

31:06.168 --> 31:07.648
Yeah, from-from brain trauma.

31:07.691 --> 31:09.563
Wh-What about my other recovery?

31:11.391 --> 31:13.523
If I can no longer function
as a detective,

31:13.567 --> 31:17.266
I-I'm just not sure
I can stay sober.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.268
And if I can't stay sober,

31:19.312 --> 31:22.228
how's my brain gonna heal?

31:30.932 --> 31:33.021
Anyway, we, uh...

31:33.065 --> 31:36.155
we need to bring someone in
to fix the guest room.

31:37.939 --> 31:40.855
Good night, Watson.

31:48.950 --> 31:51.474
Hey. Heard you were in here.

31:51.518 --> 31:52.736
You heard right.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.347
I didn't visit the scene

31:54.390 --> 31:55.348
where Sophie Bishop's body
was found.

31:55.391 --> 31:56.349
I was wondering what evidence

31:56.392 --> 31:57.916
I might have spotted if I had.

31:57.959 --> 32:00.048
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

32:00.092 --> 32:01.658
lots of cops checked it out.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.922
CSU, Joan, me.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.880
You were looking for me?

32:05.924 --> 32:08.535
Yeah. A woman just showed up
at the front desk.

32:08.578 --> 32:11.842
Says she knows who killed Sophie
Bishop and Sammy Olivetti.

32:11.886 --> 32:14.497
She thinks she's next.

32:14.541 --> 32:15.890
I need police protection.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.892
My life is in danger.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.112
Well, let's start
at the beginning, okay?

32:20.155 --> 32:22.375
You said you and
Ms. Bishop were friends?

32:22.418 --> 32:23.680
Sort of.

32:23.724 --> 32:25.813
Do you know
what Eskimo sisters are?

32:25.856 --> 32:28.468
Two women who've had sexual
relations with the same man

32:28.511 --> 32:30.252
but remain on good terms.

32:31.427 --> 32:32.907
Uh, would I be correct
in thinking

32:32.951 --> 32:34.909
that the man
that you and Ms. Bishop shared

32:34.953 --> 32:36.693
was Sammy Olivetti?

32:36.737 --> 32:38.521
Me and Sammy
started hooking up about a year

32:38.565 --> 32:40.349
after he and Sophie broke up.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.917
We were together for a few
months and then we weren't.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.311
And then we were on again.
Then we were permanently off.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.400
After that, he started seeing
this psycho bitch

32:47.443 --> 32:48.836
named Luna.

32:48.879 --> 32:51.012
They were together
for almost a year...

32:51.056 --> 32:52.013
You know,
I was recently reminded

32:52.057 --> 32:53.493
of our fleeting mortality,

32:53.536 --> 32:56.017
so I'm wondering
if you're approaching a point.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.497
You know,
you could be nice to me.

32:57.540 --> 32:59.151
I'm here in distress.

32:59.194 --> 33:02.023
You were saying. Luna.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.417
When the tape of Sammy
and Sophie came out,

33:04.460 --> 33:06.941
Luna lost her mind.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.812
She was jealous.Mm-hmm.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.597
See, she and Sammy
had made a tape, too.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.252
Only he told her he had never
done that with anyone else.

33:13.295 --> 33:16.603
So she sent Sophie a
bunch of text messages.

33:16.646 --> 33:19.084
She said she hoped
they both would die.

33:19.127 --> 33:21.086
And they did.

33:21.129 --> 33:22.609
Okay.

33:22.652 --> 33:25.133
So what makes you think
you'd be next?

33:25.177 --> 33:27.005
Because...

33:27.048 --> 33:29.181
I made a tape with Sammy, too.

33:30.878 --> 33:33.446
You didn't make a sex tape
with Sammy Olivetti, did you?

33:33.489 --> 33:34.838
Nope.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.278
Here's the one

33:39.321 --> 33:40.975
of me and Sammy.

33:41.019 --> 33:44.022
In case you need it
as, like, evidence.

33:49.244 --> 33:51.812
Actually, Ms. Marshall,
I don't think

33:51.855 --> 33:52.813
that'll be necessary.On the contrary,

33:52.856 --> 33:54.815
this is most helpful.

33:54.858 --> 33:56.164
Thank you very much.

33:59.689 --> 34:02.692
Did he just steal my phone?

34:03.693 --> 34:06.131
[moaning]

34:08.916 --> 34:10.351
Yes.

34:10.396 --> 34:12.353
[moaning]

34:12.398 --> 34:14.400
[phone chimes]

34:18.012 --> 34:20.275
[moaning continues]

34:23.277 --> 34:25.237
Why are you watching
a sex tape?

34:25.280 --> 34:26.672
Sammy. Sammy.

34:26.716 --> 34:29.197
At the moment,
purely as an education.

34:29.241 --> 34:30.851
Sammy was not
without his skills,

34:30.893 --> 34:33.071
and far be it from me
to think I know everything.

34:33.114 --> 34:36.291
That is Sammy Olivetti,
but that is not Sophie.

34:36.335 --> 34:38.554
How many sex tapes
did this guy make?

34:38.598 --> 34:40.382
Quite a few, I've learned.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.341
But this one was all it took.

34:42.384 --> 34:44.125
All it took to do what?

34:44.168 --> 34:46.562
To inspire me to pay
another visit to Sammy's home.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.737
And we now have everything
we need to prove

34:48.782 --> 34:50.827
that Ryan Hayes is a killer.

35:04.363 --> 35:06.321
Uh, Captain, uh,

35:06.365 --> 35:09.498
you didn't bring us down here
to watch movies, did you?

35:09.542 --> 35:12.066
As a matter
of fact, we did.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.241
May I ask why?

35:13.285 --> 35:15.200
Cinematic appreciation.

35:15.243 --> 35:17.593
For a filmmaker who was taken
from us too soon

35:17.637 --> 35:18.855
but whose body of
work rivals that

35:18.899 --> 35:21.031
of the form's greatest auteurs.

35:21.075 --> 35:22.381
In volume, at least.

35:22.424 --> 35:24.557
Originality, not so much.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.428
Have a seat, please.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.911
WATSON:
It was brought to our
attention that the sex tape

35:30.954 --> 35:34.262
Sammy Olivetti made
with Sophie wasn't the only one.

35:34.306 --> 35:36.090
A woman named
Bethany Marshall gave us

35:36.134 --> 35:37.570
a video that he made with her

35:37.613 --> 35:40.138
about a year after the one
he made with Sophie.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.400
She also brought
to our attention

35:41.443 --> 35:43.532
the existence
of other tapes.

35:43.576 --> 35:45.534
Turns out Sammy made
a lot of sex tapes.

35:45.578 --> 35:46.796
It was his thing.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.102
RYAN:
Okay.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.104
I don't know what kind
of sick fun

35:50.148 --> 35:51.758
you're having,

35:51.801 --> 35:53.934
but I'm not gonna sit here
and watch a sex tape

35:53.977 --> 35:56.110
of my wife's ex-boyfriend.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.634
Mr. Olivetti does play a part
in the video that you're about

35:58.678 --> 36:00.984
to see, but it's not a sex tape.

36:01.028 --> 36:02.899
It's a snuff film.

36:02.943 --> 36:04.901
See, Mr. Holmes
noticed that

36:04.945 --> 36:06.903
Bethany's tape was
different from Sophie's

36:06.947 --> 36:10.472
in that it didn't start with
Sammy setting up the camera.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.039
HOLMES:
Rather, it starts with

36:12.082 --> 36:14.302
Sammy and Bethany making
their way from his front door

36:14.346 --> 36:15.869
to the couch.

36:15.912 --> 36:19.264
His camera
had already been activated.

36:19.307 --> 36:21.135
But how? And by whom?

36:21.179 --> 36:23.572
Now, given his fondness for
sex tapes, I thought perhaps

36:23.616 --> 36:25.966
he'd had a system installed
expressly for this purpose.

36:26.009 --> 36:28.098
I remembered there was
a deadbolt on his front door,

36:28.142 --> 36:29.099
which, apparently,
he rarely used.

36:29.143 --> 36:30.797
So I checked it.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.278
And the deadbolt
was Sammy's secret switch,

36:33.321 --> 36:35.236
which he activated
only when he brought home

36:35.280 --> 36:37.804
an intended subject
for one of his videos.

36:37.847 --> 36:39.327
Now, obviously,
no woman would question

36:39.371 --> 36:41.155
Sammy locking his front door.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.158
I mean, after all,
they'd want their privacy.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.465
Unfortunately for you,
you also wanted your privacy

36:46.508 --> 36:48.989
when you broke
into Sammy's house to kill him.

36:49.032 --> 36:51.948
So when you threw the deadbolt,
without knowing it,

36:51.992 --> 36:54.081
you turned on the camera.GREGSON: You and
your wife had met

36:54.124 --> 36:56.475
with Sammy several
times by then.

36:56.518 --> 36:59.826
And since you didn't enter his
house forcibly the second time,

36:59.869 --> 37:01.654
we can only assume
that you managed

37:01.697 --> 37:03.438
to get your hands on a key.

37:03.482 --> 37:05.310
HOLMES: Can't fault you
for failing to stop the hidden

37:05.353 --> 37:06.789
video system.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.313
It was skillfully concealed.

37:08.356 --> 37:09.749
I missed it.

37:09.792 --> 37:11.446
WATSON: The one other
difference between

37:11.490 --> 37:13.187
Sophie's video and Bethany's

37:13.231 --> 37:17.104
was that Bethany's was shot
in Sammy's living room.

37:17.147 --> 37:18.932
Which I'm sure you recognize,
'cause it's where you did

37:18.975 --> 37:20.368
some of your best work.

37:22.327 --> 37:23.806
SAMMY:
What the hell?

37:33.251 --> 37:36.906
Maybe now you'd like to tell us
what you did with Sammy's body?

37:41.998 --> 37:44.305
Hey. Uh,
this is Ramon.

37:44.349 --> 37:47.526
He specializes in restoring
brownstones and old woodwork.

37:47.569 --> 37:48.701
Ramon.

37:48.744 --> 37:49.789
Hey.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.617
I'm gonna go to my truck,

37:51.660 --> 37:53.619
bring in some stain samples
for you to look at,

37:53.662 --> 37:55.621
and we'll get that order
written up. Sound good?

37:55.664 --> 37:58.145
That sounds great. Thanks.

37:58.188 --> 38:00.974
So, I was thinking, since
we're doing work down here,

38:01.017 --> 38:04.804
maybe we can make that into
a meditation room also and--

38:04.847 --> 38:07.633
I don't know-- maybe
bring in a treadmill.

38:07.676 --> 38:09.896
Well, mindfulness and
aerobic exercise have proven

38:09.939 --> 38:12.115
to, uh, speed up the
recovery for PCS.

38:12.159 --> 38:14.553
There's a lot of other things
you can try in here, too.

38:14.596 --> 38:16.337
You've done a lot of research.

38:16.381 --> 38:19.558
Well, I know that your doctor's
putting together a plan,

38:19.601 --> 38:22.387
but he doesn't know how hard
you're gonna push yourself.

38:22.430 --> 38:25.128
"Pushing yourself"--
that does sound like me.

38:27.130 --> 38:30.525
You're not gonna go through this
alone, okay?

38:34.224 --> 38:36.270
All right,
I'm gonna finish up with Ramon.

38:36.314 --> 38:39.360
â™ª I want to live

38:39.404 --> 38:42.581
â™ª Before I die

38:42.624 --> 38:45.671
â™ª Free the sky's thunder

38:45.714 --> 38:48.282
â™ª Inside my chest

38:48.326 --> 38:51.024
â™ª Now and again

38:51.067 --> 38:52.939
â™ª I wonder why

38:52.982 --> 38:55.158
Hello?Hello, Michael?

38:55.202 --> 38:57.291
It's Sherlock Holmes.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.294
[winded]:
Sherlock. Hey. What's going on?

39:00.338 --> 39:02.775
Did I catch you at a bad time?
You sound winded.

39:02.818 --> 39:05.255
No. Just out for a walk.

39:05.299 --> 39:07.997
Well, I, uh... I appreciated
what you said the other day

39:08.041 --> 39:10.826
about, um,
how you found strength

39:10.870 --> 39:13.568
in focusing on your work, and...

39:13.612 --> 39:16.658
you said to call if I ever,
you know, needed to talk.

39:16.702 --> 39:19.095
So, um... Well, I was thinking
of going to a meeting.

39:19.139 --> 39:21.097
I wondered
if you'd like to join.

39:21.141 --> 39:24.187
Yeah. I just might need
a little time to get there,

39:24.231 --> 39:27.190
but, um,
how's St. Olaf's at 4:00?

39:27.234 --> 39:30.280
Excellent. St. Olaf's at 4:00.

39:30.324 --> 39:31.934
See you then.

39:31.978 --> 39:37.026
â™ª Song about
the seasons' change â™ª

39:37.070 --> 39:40.421
â™ª Born and dead

39:40.465 --> 39:43.206
â™ª Born again

39:43.250 --> 39:48.429
â™ª Some beast will find you

39:48.473 --> 39:50.649
â™ª By name.
