00:35.480 --> 00:37.439
That bouncer nearly took your head off.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.680
(MEN CONVERSE INDISTINCTLY)

00:43.480 --> 00:45.199
That was a nice catch by you, though.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.159
- Thanks, mate. Thanks.
- (LAUGHS)

00:47.160 --> 00:49.479
Yeah, yeah. Starving.

00:49.480 --> 00:53.519
(CHUCKLES) I had the
shot of the day, easy.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.399
You up for a meal, Clay?

00:55.400 --> 00:56.960
Yeah, sounds good, Ravi.

Air Date 25 May 2017

01:39.040 --> 01:41.479
REPORTER: Oliver Pittman, when
did you start playing cricket?

01:41.480 --> 01:42.680
Third class.

01:42.681 --> 01:44.119
And you obviously enjoy the game.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.320
Yeah.

01:45.321 --> 01:47.159
- You like bowling?
- Yeah.

01:47.160 --> 01:50.140
- Who's your favourite player?
- Clay Nelson.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.999
And guess who's here to
present you with your trophy

01:55.000 --> 01:56.600
for Player of the Tournament.

01:58.680 --> 02:01.399
Congratulations, Oliver.
It's great to meet you.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.479
On behalf of the cricket
guys, that's yours.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.759
Thank you.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.799
- Play for Australia one day, eh?
- Yeah.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.000
Yeah.

02:15.840 --> 02:19.959
And for the next eight years,
Oliver just lived for cricket.

02:19.960 --> 02:22.439
He went from the fresh-faced
kid we see there,

02:22.440 --> 02:23.879
to the brink of the national team

02:23.880 --> 02:26.280
with you in his corner
every step of the way.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.840
And now he's dead.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.840
Do I have your attention, Mr Nelson?

02:42.600 --> 02:44.279
Doesn't that weigh on your conscience?

02:44.280 --> 02:45.919
He was meant to be
focusing on the test team,

02:45.920 --> 02:48.479
and yet you got him to pull on
his boots for the Firecrackers.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.479
Did you... did you call in a favour?

02:50.480 --> 02:53.000
Play on what you'd done for
him? How much he owed you?

02:54.840 --> 02:56.967
How many times did you ask him?

02:56.973 --> 02:58.279
- Once.
- Once.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.759
One time. I asked him, he said yes.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.439
- Yeah, well, that's bullshit.
- How dare you!

03:02.440 --> 03:03.600
We all know that's absolute...

03:03.601 --> 03:05.639
TONY: Listen, let's just
take a short adjournment.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.199
I'll give you a minute
to inform your client

03:07.200 --> 03:08.559
of the powers at our disposal.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.039
RICHARD: My client, Mr Examiner,

03:10.040 --> 03:12.319
is a man of considerable
standing in the community

03:12.325 --> 03:13.731
who deserves to be treated with respect.

03:13.738 --> 03:15.338
I'm not interested, Mr Stirling.

03:24.320 --> 03:25.879
You can't talk to him like that, Janet.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.119
You're an officer of the court.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.919
Tony, this isn't a court,
and a 21-year-old boy is dead.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.199
Well, he didn't murder him, Janet.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.799
- Might as well have.
- And this reference...

03:32.800 --> 03:34.599
The more upset he becomes,
the more we get out of him.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.239
This reference isn't
about Oliver's suicide.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.639
Including the name of the match fixer.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.559
This reference has been
established to uncover the links

03:39.560 --> 03:41.159
between gambling, sport
and organised crime,

03:41.160 --> 03:43.040
which means identifying
the blokes at the top.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.479
Which is exactly what we decided.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.148
- You mean you stated.
- Well, I am the Chief Examiner.

03:49.154 --> 03:50.639
"But this will be
your reference, Janet."

03:50.640 --> 03:52.831
In here, yes. But we are the
National Crime Commission.

03:52.837 --> 03:53.960
We just want to know who's the big catch

03:53.960 --> 03:55.160
and where are the proceeds of crime.

03:55.161 --> 03:56.479
- Which you will get.
- Now!

03:56.480 --> 03:57.911
- Soon!
- We should really head back in.

03:57.917 --> 03:59.606
Uh, right. Um, well,

03:59.612 --> 04:00.879
we are a team, yes?

04:00.880 --> 04:03.240
- Common goals, common purposes?
- Of course.

04:11.840 --> 04:16.079
The examination of Clay
Nelson is resuming at 2:15pm.

04:16.079 --> 04:19.238
All those present
prior to the adjournment

04:19.240 --> 04:20.678
are present at the resumption.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.119
Thank you, Mr Examiner.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.039
Mr Examiner, if I may observe...

04:24.040 --> 04:27.759
You may observe privately, Mr Stirling.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.159
Unless invited to share your
thoughts, I do not expect to hear...

04:30.160 --> 04:32.199
Under Section 2 of the National
Crimes Commission Act...

04:32.200 --> 04:34.239
Section 2 refers to counsel
representing, Mr Stirling.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.799
You are present under Section
9, which is at my invitation.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.319
So, if I may briefly
descend into common parlance,

04:39.320 --> 04:40.440
shut up.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.999
Thank you.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.399
When was your last game as captain
of the Australian Test team?

04:48.400 --> 04:50.119
It was 18 months ago.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.999
And since then?

04:52.000 --> 04:55.039
Well, Ravi Hasan called and said the
Firecrackers were after a skipper.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.799
That's a new team in
the Asia Twenty League.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.079
So I signed on.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.599
And you, in turn, convinced
Oliver Pittman to sign.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.160
Yes. I said, "Mate, how
about it?" He said, "Sure."

05:05.320 --> 05:07.199
BIANCA: Well, this is Oliver's version

05:07.200 --> 05:10.120
at the police interview he gave
four days before his suicide.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.519
WOMAN: Was it a hard decision?

05:16.520 --> 05:19.720
Yeah. I didn't want to, at all.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.880
I'd just got in the Test
squad, and the one-dayers.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.800
I thought it was too much cricket.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.080
But Clay's Clay, you know?

05:33.880 --> 05:35.439
I mean, it's Clay Nelson.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.119
And when he's calling you
every night of the week,

05:38.120 --> 05:39.600
you have to.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.399
So...

05:49.400 --> 05:51.919
"Mate, how about it?" That was all?

05:51.920 --> 05:53.959
Yeah, look I...

05:53.960 --> 05:56.959
He never... said any of that to me.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.559
I mean, we... I called him and
we spoke about it, he said yes.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.199
Right, well that's the first lie.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.719
And I'm sure Mr Stirling's informed you

06:02.720 --> 06:04.439
of the punishments we may enforce

06:04.440 --> 06:07.079
if witnesses perjure themselves
before the Commission.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.200
Now...

06:09.200 --> 06:10.760
who told him to bowl a wide?

06:11.498 --> 06:13.840
- I don't know.
- Did you ask him?

06:17.120 --> 06:18.120
No.

06:18.121 --> 06:20.679
Even when he was labelled a cheat
on the front page of everything,

06:20.680 --> 06:22.839
the media camped outside
his house for two weeks

06:22.840 --> 06:25.279
and the Board of Cricket
cancelled his contract?

06:25.280 --> 06:26.839
Did you call him then?

06:26.840 --> 06:29.120
Offer any words of comfort at all?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.799
Well, I thought it
would make things worse.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.679
I mean, none of us knew...

06:38.680 --> 06:40.279
how hard he was taking it.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.159
Second lie.

06:42.160 --> 06:45.120
Don't you feel you owe that
boy anything? Look at him.

06:45.175 --> 06:47.257
You exposed him to
this grubby environment.

06:47.263 --> 06:48.639
I didn't know any of this would happen!

06:48.640 --> 06:50.604
You didn't know anything! Seriously?

06:52.440 --> 06:54.639
He bowls four straight balls,

06:54.640 --> 06:56.519
and then the betting
companies around the world

06:56.520 --> 06:59.239
doubled the odds on the next
ball being bowled a wide,

06:59.240 --> 07:02.279
and, what, within 15
seconds, millions go on it,

07:02.280 --> 07:05.307
and it is a wide, or so
I'm told. Is that a wide?

07:11.200 --> 07:13.279
- Yes.
- Except the referee didn't call it.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.319
Umpire. It's cricket, not football.

07:15.320 --> 07:18.919
The official let it go because
it wasn't clearly a wide

07:18.920 --> 07:21.239
and some big punters lost a lot of cash.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.439
And, well, Oliver's reaction, of course,

07:23.440 --> 07:25.080
gave the whole game away.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.920
So, even then, on the field,

07:29.921 --> 07:32.359
you can't tell me you didn't
ask him what that was all about.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.879
Or after the press conference,
when all hell broke loose.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.560
Nothing at all?

07:40.040 --> 07:42.680
It didn't seem... I
mean, I didn't think...

07:59.520 --> 08:01.599
I thought...

08:01.600 --> 08:04.240
ignoring it would be
like standing by him.

08:04.502 --> 08:06.109
Third lie.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.600
Who was it?

08:09.601 --> 08:11.599
You've played with or against
the other players in that team

08:11.600 --> 08:14.322
for over a decade, you
must have your suspicions.

08:16.440 --> 08:20.879
We know you bet $5,000 on
a satellite tennis match

08:20.880 --> 08:22.000
in Darwin last October.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.639
I play cricket, lady. I don't bet on it.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.400
Have you ever met Nate Baldwin?

08:26.520 --> 08:28.400
The footballer? I don't know.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.842
He also bet on that tennis match,

08:33.866 --> 08:37.759
and some others who bet on that match
also bet on Oliver bowling a wide.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.479
Can you see the pattern here?

08:39.480 --> 08:41.359
RICHARD: Mr Examiner, please,
this line of questioning

08:41.360 --> 08:44.319
is an unsubstantiated
personal attack on my client.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.199
I believe I asked you
to shut up, Mr Stirling.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.999
I have to protest the intimidation
being shown here towards my client.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.751
Out, thank you. This is not a court.

08:50.757 --> 08:52.763
Your invitation to
attend has been withdrawn.

08:52.769 --> 08:54.469
- I beg your pardon?
- I said get out,

08:54.475 --> 08:56.125
before I find you in contempt.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.879
(SLAMS DOOR)

09:09.880 --> 09:11.799
Can you see the pattern here, Clay?

09:11.800 --> 09:13.559
If not, I'll spell it out.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.639
Someone's giving you the valuable
tips on where the smart money is,

09:16.640 --> 09:19.200
and it can only be someone on your team.

09:24.920 --> 09:29.279
Ravi Hasan's house, one day
after the match in question.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.789
Coincidence? Well, that
doesn't quite cover it, does it?

09:37.440 --> 09:39.181
I don't know anything about that.

09:39.196 --> 09:41.999
Pittman's wide is part
of a comprehensive network

09:42.000 --> 09:44.399
of betting accounts
covering many sports.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.959
And when things don't go to plan,

09:45.960 --> 09:49.119
houses get blown up and
young players commit suicide.

09:49.120 --> 09:52.559
Now, don't risk lying
to us a fourth time.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.439
Someone on your team is
part of this syndicate,

09:55.440 --> 09:58.399
and as captain, you were
either complicit or aware.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.480
Who is it?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.680
It's probably Ravi.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.200
I spoke at Oliver's funeral, you know.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.760
Yeah, so I saw.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.840
Were you there for him or the cameras?

10:46.880 --> 10:48.080
Did you get the warning

10:48.081 --> 10:49.799
about not telling anyone
what was said in there?

10:49.800 --> 10:51.407
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- They mean it. Be careful.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.639
Has that blonde chick even
seen a game of cricket before?

10:54.640 --> 10:55.959
(CHUCKLES) I doubt it.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.263
- So, you know her?
- Did.

10:58.269 --> 10:59.679
I was on a Royal
Commission with her once,

10:59.680 --> 11:01.880
and we were at the DPP
together for a while.

11:02.269 --> 11:04.162
- It was a long time ago now.
- Mate, is she any good?

11:04.168 --> 11:05.474
Or is she just piss and wind?

11:05.480 --> 11:06.719
Oh, she's very good.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.400
That's why they brought
her back for this.

11:10.440 --> 11:11.759
BIANCA: What do you think?

11:11.760 --> 11:13.919
Well, we either broke him
into telling the truth,

11:13.920 --> 11:16.599
or forced him into a lie,
which is still leverage.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.639
A wide ball in a cricket
match just seems so trivial.

11:19.640 --> 11:22.359
And yet, it's our best
chance to get inside all this.

11:22.360 --> 11:24.959
Ah, Janet. Your analyst, Bonnie Mahesh.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.202
Ah. Welcome. Thanks for coming on board.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.991
I was tossing up options
and thought I could either

11:28.997 --> 11:31.985
work for people with real
influence or... come here.

11:31.991 --> 11:33.559
But a national crime commission

11:33.560 --> 11:36.680
did sound marginally cooler
than ASIO, so here I am.

11:37.720 --> 11:38.920
Wonderful.

11:38.921 --> 11:41.799
- Uh, Owen wants to see me.
- Oh, great. Give him my best.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.032
Or not, if you don't want
to. All the same to me.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.120
- I'll see you later?
- Sure.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.119
LINA: Okay, bye.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.320
Hello, stranger.

12:06.321 --> 12:08.319
Janet! Hi! I heard you were back.

12:08.320 --> 12:11.052
- How's motherhood?
- Oh, you know. Sleep, what's that?

12:11.058 --> 12:12.655
But it's still pretty magic.

12:12.661 --> 12:14.560
- What is he now?
- Uh, she.

12:14.566 --> 12:15.799
She turned two, last week.

12:15.805 --> 12:18.127
- And Andy?
- Much older. (CHUCKLES)

12:18.280 --> 12:21.239
Oh. Uh, But busy, you know. Always busy.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.399
Seems like I only see
him 10 minutes a day.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.439
- There's her smile.
- Mm, sweet.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.879
- We'll have to catch up sometime.
- I would love that. Call me.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.159
There you are.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.119
Thought you might have
still been on island time.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.240
I never was.

12:32.241 --> 12:34.919
- Two years in Fiji? Come on.
- It wasn't a holiday.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.399
- You were still paying me, remember?
- Yeah, tell me about it.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.799
The UN Under-Secretary gets
us to send someone over there

12:39.800 --> 12:41.279
to train up a bunch of new prosecutors,

12:41.280 --> 12:42.679
and somehow it ends up on my budget.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.639
Because we are responsible members
of the international community.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.879
I still think you spent
half the time on the beach.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.799
I was looking forward to
getting you back, you know.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.079
I'd lined up all these cases.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.279
And then, all of a sudden I
get this resignation letter.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.198
What happened? Is it negotiable?

12:55.480 --> 12:57.421
I've already started something else.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.385
National Crime Commission?

13:00.400 --> 13:02.399
Bianca swing that, did
she? Jobs for the girls?

13:02.400 --> 13:04.039
No. Tony asked me, actually.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.959
Ah, Tony. Is he still pissed with me?

13:05.960 --> 13:08.679
- Well, you did take his job.
- I accepted an offer.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.759
- No backroom conversations?
- They weren't needed.

13:10.760 --> 13:14.039
His contract was never gonna get
renewed, Roger Embry saw to that.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.559
You can't publicly embarrass

13:15.560 --> 13:17.279
the head of the State
Corruption Commission

13:17.280 --> 13:18.759
and expect no payback.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.279
But then, Tony probably
wouldn't have minded

13:20.280 --> 13:21.959
if they'd tapped you on
the shoulder instead of me.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.159
Although the Attorney General
had to resign because of you.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.879
And why weren't you
tarred with that brush?

13:26.880 --> 13:28.119
Because I know how to play the game.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.719
- And I don't?
- Well, when it's fair play you do.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.559
But, uh, unfortunately,
not many games are.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.119
Owen, why am I here if you
already know what I'm doing?

13:35.120 --> 13:36.759
Okay, cards on the table.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.839
It's no secret I've got six
months left on this contract,

13:38.840 --> 13:40.559
and then I have to reapply.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.399
If you're planning to
use success at the NCC

13:42.400 --> 13:44.880
to get the Director's spot,
then be ready for a fight.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.079
If not, then I'll help you
get the guys you want to nail.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.879
Or we could just agree to
stay out of each other's way.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.760
And that's option three.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.480
Come on.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.680
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

14:02.681 --> 14:05.269
- What did they ask him?
- Maxine, please, I can't tell you.

14:05.275 --> 14:06.639
- Tell me.
- I can't!

14:06.640 --> 14:08.599
Clay Nelson's the most
important client I have.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.760
I appreciate that.

14:09.761 --> 14:11.439
Look, he's a former
Australian Test captain,

14:11.440 --> 14:13.080
winner of three Ashes series...

14:14.400 --> 14:16.726
Oh, my God, please tell me you
know something about cricket.

14:16.732 --> 14:19.299
Yeah, of course. I'm more into cycling.

14:19.305 --> 14:21.359
All right, well, think of,
uh... think of Lance Armstrong.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.799
- He's... Actually, don't.
- No.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.119
- Cadel Evans.
- Good choice.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.839
Clean icon of his sport. So
you think Cadel, that's Clay.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.119
I'm in the middle of negotiating

14:28.120 --> 14:30.709
a very important one-year contract
with him for the Firecrackers,

14:30.715 --> 14:32.004
which will probably be his last,

14:32.010 --> 14:33.959
and I can't afford any
more negative publicity.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.803
So, what'd they ask him? What, was
it about Oliver Pittman? Tell me.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.719
I couldn't possibly
confirm that statement.

14:39.720 --> 14:40.880
I knew it!

14:40.881 --> 14:43.839
One bad ball and
everybody's crying for blood.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.279
I didn't say anything.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.439
Oh, of course you didn't. What else?

14:47.440 --> 14:49.559
Oh, come on! All the
work I'm sending your way,

14:49.560 --> 14:51.119
you've got to give me something.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.399
You're making more off
these guys than I am now.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.879
I mean, not that you haven't earnt it.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.959
Still, if I had 15% of your salary

14:56.960 --> 14:59.599
I could fuck off to the Maldives
and drink margaritas for a decade.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.119
Actually, at this point in my career,

15:01.120 --> 15:02.737
you'd be at Bondi with a light beer.

15:02.743 --> 15:05.479
- So, was it just about Oliver? Tell me.
- I'm not saying any more.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.279
In fact, I'm gonna change
the subject completely

15:07.280 --> 15:08.959
to a totally different
topic of conversation,

15:08.960 --> 15:10.319
utterly unrelated to anything else.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.480
All right, go on, then.

15:11.481 --> 15:13.479
Did you know that Nate
Baldwin used to gamble?

15:13.480 --> 15:15.759
Well, most of Australians gamble.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.039
Yeah, not on the same
games Clay used to bet on.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.319
Well, observation's noted.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.479
I'll see you at the charity auction.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.199
Clay donated a bat.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.959
I've got a buyer lined up for it.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.079
All you've got to do is drive
it up to 10 grand for us.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.931
All good? Ciao, now.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.639
MAN: On your marks!

15:37.640 --> 15:38.919
Set!

15:38.920 --> 15:40.399
(FIRES GUN)

15:40.400 --> 15:42.039
- Go, Em!
- She's good!

15:42.040 --> 15:43.799
Come on, Em. That's it!

15:43.800 --> 15:45.679
- She's good.
- Come on, Emma.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.079
Go, Emma!

15:47.080 --> 15:48.879
She's winning! Go, Em!

15:48.880 --> 15:51.319
Go, Em! Go! Yes!

15:51.320 --> 15:52.839
(CROWD CHEERS)

15:52.840 --> 15:55.479
All that running in
Fiji's really paid off.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.959
I just remember they were
non-stop up and down that beach.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.960
Yeah, that was such a nice week.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.679
But if she keeps winning by that much,

16:02.680 --> 16:04.519
these guys will probably
think she's a drug cheat.

16:04.520 --> 16:05.879
Mm. I wish that was a joke.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.159
You know, I was reading yesterday,

16:07.160 --> 16:09.399
the youngest person they
ever tested was nine.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.640
Can you believe that?

16:11.920 --> 16:15.480
You know, Owen was saying I'm only
on the Commission because of you.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.759
Owen sees conspiracies everywhere.

16:19.760 --> 16:20.880
True.

16:20.881 --> 16:22.479
And everyone knows most
of them are nonsense.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.879
- Oh darling, that was fantastic.
- Well done!

16:24.880 --> 16:26.959
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, Mum.

16:26.960 --> 16:29.164
Can I have money for one of them?

16:29.170 --> 16:30.973
- Yes, absolutely.
- Can I have one too?

16:30.979 --> 16:32.279
- Sorry, I should have got you one.
- Yep.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.487
No fizzy drinks, all
right? Bring me the change.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.361
Sorry.

16:36.367 --> 16:38.879
So much for basking
in the glow of victory.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.962
All just good fun at their age.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.732
ANNOUNCER: Janet King, please
come to the recording tent.

16:43.738 --> 16:45.461
Janet King, please come
to the recording tent.

16:45.467 --> 16:47.056
- Looks like I'm in trouble.
- You're in trouble, yeah.

16:49.080 --> 16:51.120
That was good, girls. Well done.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.439
Three-tenths outside a state record.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.119
- On no training? That's talent.
- Run upstairs, get changed, please!

17:00.120 --> 17:01.879
- No!
- Can we have a story?

17:01.880 --> 17:03.519
- Yes, of course.
- Yes!

17:03.520 --> 17:06.638
What's three-tenths? That's
like... 10 metres, isn't it?

17:06.640 --> 17:08.159
It's more like two.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.559
She said both of them
should look at going to Zone.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.598
Sorry, I just want to see what that is.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.256
You google, I'll see you tomorrow.

17:15.262 --> 17:17.638
All right. You sure? No, sorry,
do you want to stay? Sorry.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.878
- Mum, come up here!
- Okay, just a minute!

17:19.880 --> 17:21.319
Mum!

17:21.326 --> 17:23.246
- Later. Another time.
- Thank you. Thank you.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.919
Mm. Thanks.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.239
See ya, guys!

17:27.240 --> 17:29.079
- Bye.
- Bye!

17:29.080 --> 17:31.240
Records. Where are the records?

17:36.920 --> 17:38.239
Clever girl.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.960
All right, what's Zone?

17:51.480 --> 17:53.679
It's stood since 1980,
and Emma's nearly there.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.239
I mean, with a little bit of training...

17:55.240 --> 17:57.719
- Oh, if she wants to train.
- Well, I'm not gonna make her train.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.116
- That's...
- No pain, no gain.

17:59.122 --> 18:01.130
Updated background on Clay's teammates.

18:01.136 --> 18:02.953
- Thanks, Wayne.
- Now where are these genes

18:02.959 --> 18:04.622
- from, anyway?
- S'pose Ash.

18:04.628 --> 18:06.562
You know, she always said
she was good at sport.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.919
Excuse me.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.617
I needed space. It's okay, right?

18:10.623 --> 18:12.617
- While you're not really using it?
- I will be, from Monday.

18:12.623 --> 18:14.719
- Sure.
- Can I just... Excuse me.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.439
- Are you bringing Ravi in this arvo?
- After his teammates.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.479
If someone dobs on him
first, it'll be easier.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.947
Well, it's a waste of time.

18:21.821 --> 18:24.439
- Really?
- He doesn't call any of them.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.284
Which is odd in itself, don't you think?

18:26.290 --> 18:28.213
A couple of group emails
when the squad was formed,

18:28.219 --> 18:30.340
the occasional text
about training times.

18:30.346 --> 18:32.439
- They just don't mingle.
- Well, if they are colluding,

18:32.440 --> 18:34.280
they just don't want to
leave any trace of it.

18:34.286 --> 18:37.437
Nah. They're a group of famous
players from all over the place,

18:37.443 --> 18:38.839
thrown together for TV.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.039
They don't hang out at
all. He wouldn't trust them.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.640
Well, we'll see, hm?

18:44.600 --> 18:46.015
Follow me.

18:47.022 --> 18:48.439
Everyone?

18:48.440 --> 18:51.159
You see, the real shame
about Oliver Pittman is,

18:51.160 --> 18:53.639
with a bit more work,
that in-swinger of his

18:53.640 --> 18:56.159
would have really rattled
the Indian batsmen next test.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.493
I just want everyone to remember
whose death started this reference

18:59.499 --> 19:02.999
before we get too carried away
with money and proceeds of crime.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.640
This young man is who we are here for.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.599
So Brandon, there hasn't been
one incident on the cricket field

19:14.600 --> 19:16.639
that's struck you as slightly strange?

19:16.640 --> 19:17.959
Not that I can recall.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.517
- No suspicious outs?
- You mean dismissals?

19:20.523 --> 19:21.915
- Yes.
- No.

19:21.921 --> 19:24.674
No ball or hit that
seemed totally reckless?

19:27.440 --> 19:29.119
I'm sorry, what's so funny?

19:29.120 --> 19:31.176
Have you ever even seen a Twenty20 game?

19:31.182 --> 19:34.263
- This is serious, Mr Williams.
- Sure, okay, well, fine. But...

19:34.269 --> 19:36.359
before you keep asking
questions like that,

19:36.360 --> 19:39.072
you really ought to know
what you're talking about.

19:42.039 --> 19:44.799
In a Twenty20 game,
everything is reckless.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.405
That's what it is.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.230
And they're called shots,
by the way, not hits.

19:51.560 --> 19:55.519
Have you seen Ravi Hasan or any
other player from the Firecrackers

19:55.520 --> 19:56.839
behave in a way that struck you

19:56.840 --> 19:59.559
as out of the ordinary for
a professional sportsman?

19:59.560 --> 20:01.439
Off the pitch, we barely see Ravi.

20:01.440 --> 20:04.439
Have you ever witnessed
him arrange a spot bet?

20:04.440 --> 20:06.360
No. Never.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.919
Are we on the wrong track?

20:08.920 --> 20:11.119
We still have nothing
solid on Ravi Hasan.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.479
Or Brandon's just a very good liar.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.399
Unless Oliver did it all on his own.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.359
Well, that seems unlikely.
He was just a kid.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.560
Nothing?

20:18.800 --> 20:20.359
We haven't examined Ravi yet.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.639
Bet you strike out.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.563
Give you 50-to-one and put down 20.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.880
Wayne, get Ravi in here.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.479
How did it work?

20:32.480 --> 20:34.559
How did you know when
the odds would lengthen?

20:34.560 --> 20:36.119
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

20:36.120 --> 20:39.611
Someone had to get a message to
Oliver, someone following the odds.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.119
I'll take your word for it.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.519
Ah, sarcasm's not your
ally in here, Mr Hasan.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.560
This person needed line
of sight to the players...

20:49.760 --> 20:51.559
They had to be in the grandstand, right?

20:51.560 --> 20:53.427
There were over 30,000
people at that match.

20:53.433 --> 20:54.879
It's not a problem if
you know where to look.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.000
That's ridiculous.

20:56.001 --> 20:58.039
I put it to you, Mr Hasan,
when the odds peaked,

20:58.040 --> 21:00.599
this person in the
stands gave you a signal.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.600
What person?

21:01.601 --> 21:03.519
And you in turn
communicated this to Oliver.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.426
- What?!
- Who gave you the signal, Mr Hasan?

21:05.432 --> 21:07.807
- No one. There was no signal.
- So, why was your house firebombed?

21:07.813 --> 21:10.218
- How should I know?
- Well, I do.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.799
Some big punters around
the world put a lot of money

21:12.800 --> 21:14.919
on a ball you were meant to
make happen, and it didn't.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.359
So these big punters were very unhappy,

21:17.360 --> 21:19.640
and a day later, you
could have been killed.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.120
Am I warm?

21:24.080 --> 21:27.159
You cannot accuse me of
match-fixing without some evidence.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.600
Actually, in here, I
can do whatever I like.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.199
The night before the game,
you missed the team dinner.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.039
Weren't seen for hours.
Who were you meeting?

21:36.040 --> 21:37.359
- No one.
- We know that's a lie.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.759
I just don't like team dinners.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.999
Did you approach Oliver
before or after that meeting?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.479
I never approached Oliver.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.599
He was just a good young
player. That's all he was to me.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.479
We're gonna go back through
the hotel security footage.

21:46.480 --> 21:47.640
This is outrageous!

21:47.641 --> 21:49.679
A young boy's been hounded to death,

21:49.680 --> 21:52.719
- and you think we're outrageous?
- What sort of a country is this?

21:52.720 --> 21:55.039
I thought everyone had a right
to a fair judicial process.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.600
Or have you gotta be white for that?

21:57.800 --> 21:59.799
I've never been treated
like this anywhere.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.760
It stops now, or I call my embassy.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.359
Well, obviously we can't stop,
that's what he wants us to do.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.919
We need to contact the
staff at that hotel.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.759
- Was I right?
- When are they playing again?

22:18.760 --> 22:21.045
- Saturday, down at the 'G.
- What's the 'G?

22:21.443 --> 22:22.643
What?

22:23.960 --> 22:25.359
The Melbourne Cricket Ground.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.839
All right, this is getting embarrassing.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.652
I should go to that. I
haven't even seen a game.

22:28.658 --> 22:29.760
I don't know what the ground's called.

22:29.761 --> 22:31.399
If I'm gonna stay on
the front foot in there,

22:31.400 --> 22:32.679
I need to know what I'm talking about.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.119
- Agreed?
- Fair point.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.879
Well, I could go too, if you
like. Provide a specialist's eye.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.080
Or I could go.

22:38.081 --> 22:40.159
If we're gonna talk to
the staff at the hotel,

22:40.160 --> 22:42.465
it probably does need one
police officer, not two lawyers.

22:42.471 --> 22:43.671
Here I am.

22:43.677 --> 22:45.917
Wayne, I need you on
surveillance. I'll go.

22:47.760 --> 22:51.156
Okay, done. Get admin to book the
tickets. Same hotel as the team.

22:51.356 --> 22:53.125
- Enjoy the game.
- Mm.

22:53.647 --> 22:56.339
- Do you know the rules?
- Cricket, or travel expenses?

22:56.345 --> 22:57.808
Oh, both would be handy.

22:58.160 --> 23:01.132
In all seriousness, though,
we do need to be careful.

23:01.138 --> 23:03.959
- I know. I know!
- (LAUGHS) No, not about you and me.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.079
I mean, a cop and a lawyer.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.273
Usually, lawyers stay in the office.

23:08.279 --> 23:10.079
It's us cops who go
out and talk to people.

23:10.080 --> 23:11.879
Well, I do things my way.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.679
Even so, officially, for the day book,

23:14.680 --> 23:16.692
I need some sort of explanation.

23:17.560 --> 23:21.959
Just put Section 4,
para 17, of the NCC Act.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.639
When there's a reasonable
chance an off-site examination

23:24.640 --> 23:27.239
will be required to
question the witness,

23:27.240 --> 23:29.320
counsel should be present at the venue.

23:30.320 --> 23:31.919
Okay.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.759
Thanks.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.280
Pleasure.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.599
EMMA AND LIAM: Mummy!

23:50.600 --> 23:52.079
(BOTH LAUGH)

23:52.080 --> 23:54.719
(LAUGHS) Good running!

23:54.720 --> 23:55.920
Hey, Rose.

23:55.921 --> 23:57.719
- How was school today?
- BOTH: Good.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.479
- What'd you do?
- Boring stuff.

23:59.480 --> 24:02.399
(TUTS) Oh, boring stuff.
School's so boring.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.959
- Pssh! Pssh!
- Bam! Bam!

24:03.960 --> 24:07.439
(CHUCKLES) All right, put
the toys away now. Come on.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.879
Um, guys, I've been given
the name of some coaches,

24:09.880 --> 24:12.159
if you want to do some
training before Zone.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.959
- Okay.
- What's Zone?

24:14.960 --> 24:17.799
- Well, it's the next level up.
- Okay.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.872
So, you want to... you
want to try it? We'll...

24:19.878 --> 24:21.204
- try one out next week, all right?
- Yep.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.160
- Yep.
- Yeah.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.879
Oh, and this weekend, Mummy has to
go to Melbourne, just for the night.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.077
- Who's gonna look after us?
- Bibi?

24:27.400 --> 24:31.159
- Not Bianca?
- No, no. It's Uncle Tony.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.439
- Yeah!
- Yes!

24:32.440 --> 24:34.920
Well, I'm glad I'll be so missed.

24:50.640 --> 24:53.799
Uh, reservation under King?
Twin-share, one night, thanks.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.399
- WOMAN: Ravi! Ravi!
- (PEOPLE CHATTER EXCITEDLY)

24:56.400 --> 24:58.319
Hi! I love watching you play.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.153
- Thank you. What's your name?
- Izzy.

25:00.159 --> 25:02.480
- Izzy. Okay. No worries.
- Oh!

25:02.486 --> 25:03.839
Oh, Brandon, can you please sign?

25:03.840 --> 25:05.617
That's a beautiful name.

25:05.623 --> 25:07.653
(CHATTER)

25:07.760 --> 25:09.286
Yes, sure.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.799
Last time the Firecrackers
played in Melbourne,

25:15.800 --> 25:17.839
Oliver bowled a wide
and the world collapsed.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.730
Now they're back and they're mobbed.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.719
Like it never happened.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.840
- Get a photo. Get a photo.
- (CHEERING)

25:28.760 --> 25:31.439
They must think they're untouchable.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.880
Thank you.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.999
I reckon it's my turn to pick.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.199
What do you reckon about a
movie after the game tonight?

25:39.200 --> 25:41.359
Um, no, it's my turn.

25:41.360 --> 25:42.999
All right, you can pick.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.400
But no cricket, yeah?

25:45.640 --> 25:46.800
Check us in, mate.

25:46.801 --> 25:48.399
Hi. Uh, Nelson?

25:48.400 --> 25:50.040
(PHONE RINGS)

25:53.000 --> 25:54.319
RICHARD: Hey. Clay?

25:54.320 --> 25:56.199
Yeah, Rich, that bloody Janet King

25:56.200 --> 25:58.119
and this cop friend
of hers are here, mate.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.999
What's going on? Is
this harassment or what?

26:00.000 --> 26:02.439
- Well, did you talk to them?
- No, of course I didn't.

26:02.440 --> 26:03.520
Well, don't.

26:03.521 --> 26:05.960
And maybe don't say too much over
the phone for a while, either.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.480
All right.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.279
Oh, did Maxine talk to
you about that auction?

26:12.280 --> 26:14.559
- The one for the Pax Foundation?
- Yeah.

26:14.560 --> 26:15.943
All right. Have fun.

26:16.494 --> 26:18.719
Oh, right, okay. Are you sure?

26:18.720 --> 26:20.760
No, no, mate, I gotta go. Gotta go. Bye.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.691
- How'd you go? Beauty.
- Yeah.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.559
BIANCA: His son travels with him a lot.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.199
Lucky boy.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.279
As are Liam and Emma.
They're just as close to you.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.679
Oh, Liam's a funny one.

26:36.680 --> 26:40.039
You know boys. Shows his love
by jumping on me in the morning.

26:40.040 --> 26:43.079
- Emma's more clingy.
- Mm.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.719
Hey, how's her running going?

26:44.720 --> 26:47.239
You know, she is this close
to a 30-year-old record

26:47.240 --> 26:50.959
but she's not interested in training,
which I find strange, but anyway.

26:50.960 --> 26:54.639
But, like you said, maybe it's
better if sport is just fun.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.639
Mm, guess it's harder
when it's your living.

26:56.640 --> 26:59.519
Emma won't have that problem.
There's no money in women's sport.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.600
- No betting scandals, either.
- Hm.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.800
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.679
I hope you're not expecting
us to bid on anything.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.759
No, no, you bought tickets.
That's support enough.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.199
So, who else is gonna be here?

27:22.200 --> 27:24.519
Pretty much the whole of the
Northern Devils first grade team.

27:24.520 --> 27:27.759
- Including Nate Baldwin?
- Yes. Plus everyone else.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.561
- Richard!
- Oh, and Maxine Reynolds.

27:29.567 --> 27:31.694
- This is Nate's manager.
- Richard's friends.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.559
Pleased to meet you. Now,
ready to spend thousands

27:33.560 --> 27:35.319
to help develop sport
for the underprivileged?

27:35.320 --> 27:36.999
- (CHUCKLES)
- Great. Why don't you head in,

27:37.000 --> 27:38.879
grab yourselves a drink,
get pissed, open your wallet.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.920
I just need a few minutes
with this genius here.

27:42.880 --> 27:45.310
I got a call from Clay. Who
the fuck are those two women?

27:45.316 --> 27:46.639
They're with the
National Crime Commission.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.479
What, and they're staying at
the same hotel as the team?

27:48.480 --> 27:50.054
- What's that gonna look like?
- Suspicious.

27:50.060 --> 27:52.319
- And is it?
- It's called pressure, Maxine.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.599
A young man is dead, there
are betting plunges everywhere,

27:54.600 --> 27:56.639
strange results in about
four different sports

27:56.640 --> 27:58.679
and a Pakistani batsman
got his house burnt down.

27:58.680 --> 27:59.999
They want answers.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.720
Christ, I need a gin and tonic.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.451
Stirlo! Yes.

28:11.457 --> 28:14.239
- Hey, mate. Very well.
- How are ya? Come meet the boys.

28:14.240 --> 28:15.856
Hey, guys. Who hasn't met Stirlo?

28:15.862 --> 28:17.070
- G'day. Dave.
- Hey.

28:17.076 --> 28:19.447
Now, if you ever get
nabbed, he's your man.

28:19.453 --> 28:20.754
He dug me out of a hole.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.479
How're you going, gents?
You ready for the season?

28:22.480 --> 28:24.039
- Yeah.
- Born ready, mate.

28:24.040 --> 28:25.399
Stirlo, this is Tyler Perati.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.588
Now, he hasn't played first
grade yet, but he will this year.

28:27.594 --> 28:29.382
- You remember the name.
- Well, it's nice to meet you.

28:29.388 --> 28:30.360
Hey.

28:30.361 --> 28:32.080
Come on, mate, let's
go meet the sponsors.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.480
We'll say g'day to Darren.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.559
Hi, Richard. (CHUCKLES)

28:40.560 --> 28:42.759
You're always such a
breath of fresh air.

28:42.760 --> 28:44.279
(CHUCKLES) Really?

28:44.280 --> 28:47.040
Better words. Less testosterone.

28:48.040 --> 28:49.240
Thanks.

28:49.241 --> 28:50.559
I think.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.880
Hey, Lucy!

28:59.720 --> 29:01.199
You landed on your feet.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.679
- I was lucky.
- No, you weren't.

29:02.680 --> 29:05.039
I read how you got Nate Baldwin
off that assault charge last month.

29:05.040 --> 29:08.239
That wasn't luck. That was a
very clever, well argued defence.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.440
Thanks.

29:09.441 --> 29:11.399
I don't think you believed
it, but it was well argued.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.159
I believed it was good representation.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.479
So, you're literally
the Devils' advocate now.

29:15.480 --> 29:16.719
Ha, ha.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.204
Well, yes, I have tried to
avoid that play on words. But...

29:19.210 --> 29:20.639
You're their go-to barrister.

29:20.640 --> 29:23.239
Unless I screw it up, which could
be as early as this afternoon.

29:23.240 --> 29:24.959
Do you still enjoy doing defence work?

29:24.960 --> 29:26.120
Well, sure.

29:26.121 --> 29:29.000
But if Owen ever wants to flip
me a prosecution brief, then...

29:31.640 --> 29:33.439
So, what's it like there under Owen now?

29:33.440 --> 29:35.159

Tony's gone, Janet's gone.

Not that I miss Janet much, but...

29:40.640 --> 29:43.799
Well, I do and I don't,
if that makes sense.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.240
Perfect sense.

29:47.800 --> 29:50.679
All right, thank you,
ladies and gentlemen. Yes!

29:50.680 --> 29:52.039
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)

29:52.040 --> 29:54.639
Yes. Come on, a little
bit... a little bit of shush.

29:54.640 --> 29:56.359
Thank you. A little bit of shush.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.559
All right, as you can
see, I drew the short straw

29:58.560 --> 30:00.399
and scored today's emcee's gig.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.559
But, look, before we get you
to part with your hard-earned,

30:03.560 --> 30:05.439
can I just say on behalf
of the Northern Devils

30:05.440 --> 30:07.679
how proud I am of what this
club achieved last year.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.999
- (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
- Thank you. Yeah. That's right.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.279
I mean, going from last to fourth
in one season, it's unbelievable.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.999
And next year, we'll go all the way.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.959
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)

30:17.960 --> 30:20.000
That's right. That's right.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.519
And also, supporting the
community that supported us is...

30:25.520 --> 30:27.719
it's what a great club is all about.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.319
Now, I remember at the
beginning of last year,

30:29.320 --> 30:31.479
I sat down with Lucy, and I said,

30:31.480 --> 30:34.039
"Lucy," I said, "we've known
each other for six years,

30:34.040 --> 30:36.879
"but did you ever imagine,
in your wildest dreams,

30:36.880 --> 30:40.399
"that I'd end up captain
of a club like the Devils?"

30:40.400 --> 30:42.439
And Lucy just looked at me and said,

30:42.440 --> 30:45.679
"Well, frankly, Nate, you're
not even in my wildest dreams."

30:45.680 --> 30:47.879
(LAUGHTER)

30:47.880 --> 30:50.479
All right, thank you very much
for that laugh. I appreciate it.

Now, let's get this auction
under way, ladies and gentlemen.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.999
We're gonna go auction number one,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.999
a seven-night, five-star
Fiji holiday, all right?

30:58.000 --> 31:00.759
Can we get some enthusiasm?
That's a pretty good first thing.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.559
- (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
- Let's pump it up a little bit!

31:02.560 --> 31:04.239
All right, now, who's gonna give me...

31:04.240 --> 31:06.439
Let's start with 1,500. 1,500 anyone?

31:06.440 --> 31:08.079
15 over here. All right, 17?

31:08.080 --> 31:10.159
Have we got 17...? 17
there. Thank you, mate.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.679
TV COMMENTATOR: What a ball.

31:11.680 --> 31:13.324
- TONY: Not bad.
- Did just enough...

31:13.330 --> 31:16.439
There you go. Healthy food.
Make sure you tell Mum.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.042
Watch this catch.

31:18.720 --> 31:20.399
How awesome is that?

31:20.400 --> 31:22.062
Yeah, he's very skilful...

31:22.068 --> 31:25.159
COMMENTATOR: straight into the
safe hands of the diving Ravi Hasan.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.159
Is this the game Mum's at?

31:27.672 --> 31:31.439
Yeah, she's somewhere there in
that sea of hysterical humanity.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.799
Hard at work.

31:32.800 --> 31:35.279
What does 'hysterical' mean?

31:35.280 --> 31:38.920
Uh... it's Uncle Tony
on a Saturday night.

31:40.040 --> 31:42.960
(CROWD ROARS)

31:53.200 --> 31:55.559
They're still scoring
more than seven an over.

31:55.560 --> 31:57.039
And is that good?

31:57.040 --> 32:00.719
- Ow! Shit.
- Yeah, it's not bad. Um... Sorry.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.629
Particularly on a
ground this big. But...

32:02.635 --> 32:04.079
they've lost too many wickets.

32:04.080 --> 32:06.599
If they don't get a really good
partnership here, they're done.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.359
- Ow. Ugh.
- (CHEERING)

32:08.360 --> 32:10.777
- Whoo!
- A partnership?

32:11.071 --> 32:13.759
Oh, right, yeah. So, um, each
wicket's called a partnership

32:13.760 --> 32:15.839
because two players are
batting at the same time.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.040
Right.

32:17.041 --> 32:19.480
- (CROWD GROANS)
- That was so close.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.719
All right, the bat Clay Nelson
used to hit the Poms for 151

32:26.720 --> 32:29.279
and win the legendary
Lords Test eight years ago,

32:29.280 --> 32:30.679
signed by the whole team.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.279
Now, who's gonna give me 2,000?

32:33.280 --> 32:34.759
- MAN: Yoo!
- Thank you, mate.

32:34.760 --> 32:36.312
Two grand here. Four, anyone?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.239
Stirlo! Onya, buddy. Four from Stirlo.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.575
Six? Six?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.640
Six. Eight?

32:45.920 --> 32:47.639
Stirlo, eight. Eight from Stirlo.

32:47.640 --> 32:49.279
- 10?
- What are you doing?

32:49.280 --> 32:50.999
Since when do you have
a spare eight grand?

32:51.000 --> 32:53.679
I don't. But it's okay. There's
someone here who's going to pay 10.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.879
- I just have to get the price up.
- Oh.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.559
Okay, no worries. 8,000.

32:57.560 --> 33:00.119
I've got 8,000 here
with Stirlo, going once.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.519
- Are you sure?
- Eight, going twice.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.944
- I... I was sure.
- Go, you moneybags.

33:04.950 --> 33:07.439
Last call on $8,000!

33:07.440 --> 33:08.799
Oh, my stars.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.959
Sold!

33:10.960 --> 33:14.479
To the hottest lawyer
in town, Richie Stirlo.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.826
Nice work, buddy.

33:16.247 --> 33:18.759
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
that concludes the auction.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.719
I'd just like to thank
you all for coming out

33:20.720 --> 33:23.319
and supporting a really good
cause and supporting the team.

33:23.320 --> 33:25.919
Enjoy the rest of the
function. Thank you very much.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.320
(APPLAUSE)

33:29.689 --> 33:31.999
- What have I done?
- I think you bought a bat.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.586
Maybe you could get a second
job at a pub? Might pay it off.

33:35.592 --> 33:37.691
- You could sell your car.
- Yeah, ride your bat to work.

33:37.697 --> 33:38.968
- That'd be a look.
- (CHUCKLES)

33:38.974 --> 33:41.319
MAXINE: Uh, Richard, this is Darren.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.599
Richard's a lawyer.

33:42.600 --> 33:45.239
- Darren's in concrete.
- Concrete?

33:45.240 --> 33:47.239
Yeah. I specialise in boots.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.479
Nah, I'm only kidding.
I'm in construction.

33:49.480 --> 33:50.560
Oh... (CHUCKLES)

33:50.561 --> 33:53.592
Still, I thought it'd be better you
know, for the photos in the media,

33:53.598 --> 33:57.435
you know, of you with Clay's
bat, rather than with me,

33:57.441 --> 33:58.641
if you know what I mean.

33:58.647 --> 34:00.942
Still, I did say that I would buy it,

34:01.060 --> 34:03.582
so listen, ah, there's 10 there...

34:03.840 --> 34:06.061
you keep two for yourself, all right?

34:07.840 --> 34:09.639
Yeah, I'll come pick it
up in a couple of weeks,

34:09.639 --> 34:10.879
after all the photos.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.697
- All right, catch you round.
- Thanks, Richard.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.199
All right...

34:17.199 --> 34:18.799
Don't, uh, keep any of it.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.039
Give it all to the Foundation.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.880
You do not want to
owe that guy anything.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.639
Who is he?

34:25.800 --> 34:27.239
JANET: Darren who?

34:27.239 --> 34:28.679
BIANCA: Darren Faulkes.

34:28.679 --> 34:30.359
Gold star, Bonnie.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.079
He's been a major person of
interest in about a dozen enquiries.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.760
Couldn't ever nail him.

34:38.080 --> 34:41.034
What's Richard becoming,
lawyer to the crooks?

34:41.199 --> 34:42.759
Inspector Grieve?

34:42.760 --> 34:44.199
Sophie. Hi.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.639
This is Ms King, from the
National Crime Commission.

34:46.639 --> 34:48.839
- Nice to meet you.
- I was told you're our person here.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.206
Yeah. What do you need to know?

34:50.212 --> 34:52.395
You were the night manager
the last time the Firecrackers

34:52.400 --> 34:53.922
- played down here?
- Mm-hm.

34:54.440 --> 34:57.440
(ALL CONVERSE INDISTINCTLY)

35:06.240 --> 35:08.800
Did anyone go to Ravi
Hasan's room that night?

35:10.440 --> 35:12.686
- Should we move somewhere else?
- No, no, it's good.

35:12.692 --> 35:14.612
I like them feeling a
little uncomfortable.

35:15.640 --> 35:17.399
Ravi had a guest all night.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.199
- Did you recognise him?
- Her.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.639
Yes, definitely. She's a
very well-known actress.

35:21.640 --> 35:23.879
And he's married, and about
to run for office in Pakistan.

35:23.880 --> 35:25.679
Exactly. That's why
it's all very hush-hush.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.079
Yes, understandably.

35:27.080 --> 35:28.839
Anyway, I think
gambling and match-fixing

35:28.840 --> 35:31.199
were the last things on
his mind that evening.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.600
(ALL CONVERSE INDISTINCTLY)

35:34.640 --> 35:36.120
It's Shannon Hinksman.

35:40.658 --> 35:43.570
He's spent more time inside
than out. Is he here much?

35:43.720 --> 35:45.559
Oh, a bit, when the team is.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.239
Did you ever see Shannon
talking to Oliver Pittman?

35:48.240 --> 35:50.959
Well, yeah, but only down here.

35:50.960 --> 35:53.279
Oliver's pretty shy. He
went to the team dinner.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.519
- Who was he sitting next to?
- Brandon Williams.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.479
But then he pretty much
just stayed in his room.

35:57.480 --> 36:00.439
He was so nervous about the
game he could barely sleep.

36:00.440 --> 36:02.519
He kept ordering snacks
all through the night,

36:02.520 --> 36:04.159
so I had to reopen the kitchen.

36:04.160 --> 36:06.799
Took him pizza, a club
sandwich and a cheese board.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.439
So, you just gave him the food and left?

36:08.440 --> 36:09.799
More or less.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.079
I might have stayed
longer the last time.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.799
We talked.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.399
He was so sweet.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.719
And worried.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.920
Did he tell you anything specific?

36:20.960 --> 36:25.279
He just said, "If we lose by
one, I'm gonna feel like shit."

36:25.280 --> 36:27.039
But he never said why.

36:27.040 --> 36:29.039
Although, he did say

36:29.040 --> 36:32.040
that he just found it
really hard to say no to him.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.080
Ravi or Brandon?

36:36.080 --> 36:37.519
No, Clay.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.040
He was talking about Clay Nelson.

36:48.480 --> 36:49.919
RICHARD: You guys had
a great time, yeah?

36:49.920 --> 36:51.040
Sorry you didn't get to go to Fiji.

36:51.041 --> 36:53.239
Stirlo! Come and join us.

36:53.240 --> 36:55.719
Come on, mate, you're part of the team.

36:55.720 --> 36:57.479
- You guys mind?
- Hey, you kick on, mate.

36:57.480 --> 37:00.439
- We've got a two-year-old to rescue.
- All right, see ya.

37:00.440 --> 37:02.000
- See ya.
- Have fun.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.439
- Where are we going?
- Just the pub on the corner.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.719
No cameras, no journos. Just us.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.199
And that includes you.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.479
- No drugs.
- No, nothing.

37:13.480 --> 37:16.039
No pills, lines,
packets, tokes, nothin'.

37:16.040 --> 37:18.840
(WHISPERS) But if you want
something, just see Flynn, all right?

37:20.920 --> 37:24.439
(LAUGHS) Mate, your face! Fuck!

37:24.440 --> 37:28.040
We're good, all right.
You just relax. Have fun.

(PARTY DIN)

38:20.880 --> 38:23.199
Okay, look, how much
do you need to get home?

38:23.200 --> 38:24.799
- 50 bucks.
- Okay.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.959
Look, I know Mum will black
out in a couple of hours,

38:26.960 --> 38:28.160
but if Kev's still there

38:28.161 --> 38:29.719
I don't want to get
home till you do, yeah?

38:29.720 --> 38:31.519
I'm going to message
you as soon as I leave.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.800
Okay.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.879
- All right?
- Thank you.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.559
- I won't be much longer.
- Thanks, bubba.

38:38.560 --> 38:39.800
It's okay.

38:50.840 --> 38:52.999
Hey, babe. What are
you looking for tonight?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.279
- Fresh air.
- Oh, nice one.

38:54.280 --> 38:55.559
- You got a name?
- No.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.479
- Oh, come on.
- No.

38:57.480 --> 38:59.399
- Oh...

Wow. Hey, great tits, darl!

No! Leave me alone!

- Hey! (LAUGHS)

- Fuck off!

was about to be fucked!

40:04.960 --> 40:06.999
So, Clay.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.239
One conversation. No witnesses.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.279
Yeah, but it's got a ring of
truth to it, don't you think?

40:13.280 --> 40:15.239
He was so upset.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.599
That could be guilt as well
as grief. It does make sense.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.639
Well, it's just hearsay.
It's not much use to us.

40:23.080 --> 40:24.320
We can use it.

How?

- Cleverly.

40:41.440 --> 40:45.040
Hey, Em does like you, you know that.

40:48.440 --> 40:50.119
She's just at the age where, you know,

40:50.120 --> 40:51.439
life's a bit like a chocolate cake,

40:51.440 --> 40:54.119
if I give some for you,
there's less for her.

40:54.120 --> 40:55.599
But I'll talk to her.

40:55.600 --> 40:57.599
And she'll get used to you.

40:57.600 --> 40:58.959
I have.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.440
Only just.

41:12.840 --> 41:15.040
- Just try and clear your head.
- What?

41:18.040 --> 41:20.560
- It's better when you don't sweat it.
- (LAUGHS)

JANET: How many times did you ask him?

42:07.000 --> 42:08.439
- CLAY: Once.
- Once?

42:08.440 --> 42:11.079
One time. I asked him, he said yes.

42:11.080 --> 42:12.559
Well, that's the first lie.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.199
Who told him to bowl a wide?

42:14.200 --> 42:15.719
- None of us knew...
- Second lie...

42:15.720 --> 42:18.079
- how hard he was taking it.
- Did you ask him?

42:18.080 --> 42:20.761
Ignoring it would be
like standing by him.

42:33.440 --> 42:34.800
Thank you.

42:38.080 --> 42:39.280
I thought you should know

42:39.281 --> 42:41.200
that Clay'll have to
appear again tomorrow.

42:42.360 --> 42:43.959
Why? What more can you ask him?

42:43.960 --> 42:46.479
- What more can he tell us?
- Nothing.

42:46.480 --> 42:48.879
- Yes, he can.
- Oh, well, it won't be the truth.

42:48.880 --> 42:50.679
If you ramp up the
intimidation and the threats,

42:50.680 --> 42:51.959
then it's just like torture,

42:51.960 --> 42:54.039
everyone talks, but all they say
is whatever will make it stop.

42:54.040 --> 42:55.359
Richard, I taught you that.

Please don't lecture
me with my own notes.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.759
Either you have new
evidence or you don't.

42:58.760 --> 43:00.199
Absolutely correct, and we do.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.239
Which is... what?

43:02.240 --> 43:03.799
I'm not going to spell it all out.

43:03.800 --> 43:06.239
If it forms part of the case
against him, we've a right to know.

43:06.240 --> 43:08.919
If he's facing trial,
yes. But he's not, yet.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.239
(SIGHS)

43:10.240 --> 43:11.879
But I'm meeting with
you because I believe

43:11.880 --> 43:14.519
it's in everyone's interest for
the relationship we have with Clay

43:14.520 --> 43:17.159
to become collaborative,
not adversarial.

43:17.160 --> 43:19.559
And I'm... I'm hoping
you can help him realise

43:19.560 --> 43:21.199
the benefits of this approach.

43:21.200 --> 43:22.919
This is uncharacteristically
compassionate.

43:22.920 --> 43:24.159
It's pragmatic.

43:24.160 --> 43:27.479
I don't believe Clay's a major
profit taker in this labyrinth.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.399
He may not even know who that is.

43:29.400 --> 43:30.680
But he knows something.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.599
I... I don't think, actually,
at this point in time,

43:34.600 --> 43:37.399
I can do my job properly
and listen to you.

43:37.400 --> 43:39.279
Oh, you've always listened to me.

43:39.280 --> 43:41.519
In fact, you wouldn't be half the
barrister you are if you hadn't.

43:41.520 --> 43:44.159
And there's a time to step out of
the shadow and into the sunlight.

43:44.160 --> 43:47.440
The truth is, Richard, we're
after much bigger fish than him.

43:51.160 --> 43:53.080
I have to know what the evidence is.

43:55.880 --> 43:58.799
One of the hotel employees
spent half an hour or so

43:58.800 --> 44:01.920
with Oliver Pittman in his
room the night before the game.

44:03.040 --> 44:05.880
And they told us what
Clay asked Oliver to do.

44:07.600 --> 44:11.159
Clay was distraught when he
talked to us. You were there.

44:11.160 --> 44:13.359
He's a ball of stress
and panic and guilt.

44:13.360 --> 44:15.239
I mean, now, I know you
can advise him to say,

44:15.240 --> 44:17.639
"I don't recall" until
the cows come home,

44:17.640 --> 44:20.719
but... but he will never
feel at peace with himself,

44:20.720 --> 44:22.160
or with Oliver...

44:23.240 --> 44:24.519
until he tells us the truth.

44:24.520 --> 44:26.119
Now...

44:26.120 --> 44:28.560
what is your real duty to your client?

44:37.520 --> 44:39.120
That's all I'm gonna say.

44:45.520 --> 44:48.639
They were at the hotel, and they
would've talked to the staff, but...

44:48.640 --> 44:50.959
- Yeah.
- Look, is it real? Half-real?

44:50.960 --> 44:52.359
Complete rubbish? You tell me.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.199
So, what'd she threaten if
I didn't give her something?

44:54.200 --> 44:56.799
- What, my reputation? My assets?
- No.

44:56.800 --> 44:59.719
Nothing? I suppose she didn't
have to spell it out, though.

44:59.720 --> 45:02.439
Look, to be honest, they don't
want to force you to talk.

45:02.440 --> 45:05.519
They think they can now, of course,
but that's not really the point.

45:05.520 --> 45:08.759
They want you to agree to talk.

45:08.760 --> 45:12.199
But only if you've got something to say.

45:12.200 --> 45:13.600
Yeah, well...

45:14.920 --> 45:17.079
(SIGHS) Look, she thinks
that would help everybody.

45:17.080 --> 45:21.720
But, if they're right, I
think it would mostly help you.

45:22.785 --> 45:24.679
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

45:24.680 --> 45:26.999
- Have you got time for a game later?
- Sure, Reed.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.920
- Homework first, all right, son?
- Yeah.

45:36.520 --> 45:38.279
I'm not at the centre of any of this.

45:38.280 --> 45:40.065
- I don't know that much.
- It doesn't matter.

45:43.280 --> 45:44.760
I suppose I could...

45:46.760 --> 45:48.720
just tell them the truth.

45:52.280 --> 45:54.120
(CHUCKLES) Oh, God.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.040
Sure. Why not?

46:00.760 --> 46:04.519
She's right, you know. It actually
feels good just thinking about it.

46:04.520 --> 46:06.000
Might as well tell them everything.

46:07.217 --> 46:08.417
Thanks, mate.

46:16.160 --> 46:17.640
Good man, Rich.

46:31.240 --> 46:33.439
Who can say what he really knows?

46:33.440 --> 46:35.119
Although he might know more than we do

46:35.120 --> 46:36.559
about the fire at Ravi's house.

46:36.560 --> 46:39.079
Which was definitely
arson, the police tell us.

46:39.080 --> 46:40.759
They also told us it's actually owned

46:40.760 --> 46:42.999
by the head of security
for the Pakistan embassy.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.760
Well, that's gotta be worth a question.

46:45.713 --> 46:47.603
- Right, see you tomorrow.
- See ya.

46:50.720 --> 46:52.182
- REED: Come on. Yeah, that's it. I'm
- CLAY: Here we go. Here we go.

46:52.188 --> 46:54.319
- Still in front. I'm still in front.
- Oh!

46:54.320 --> 46:55.879
Hang on, I've got the
brake on or something.

46:55.880 --> 46:57.080
Come on.

46:57.360 --> 46:59.279
- Let's go. Oh, no, no!
- (LAUGHS)

46:59.280 --> 47:02.283
On one wheel! Let's go.. Yes! That's it.

47:02.760 --> 47:03.999
Come on.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.839
- Right. Right. Right.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go. Boom.

47:05.840 --> 47:07.959
- Oh...!
- (LAUGHS) Oh.

47:07.960 --> 47:09.319
Come on.

47:09.320 --> 47:10.639
Something's wrong with this...

47:10.640 --> 47:12.959
- No, come on! I'm gonna appeal, mate.
- I'm s... I didn't meant to.

47:12.960 --> 47:14.640
- I didn't mean to.
- I'm gonna appeal, mate.

47:15.737 --> 47:17.679
- Ready? Ready? Ready?
- No, no, hold on. Hold on.

47:17.680 --> 47:18.951
Can we get it? Yes!

47:18.957 --> 47:20.959
- Oh! Oh, backflip.
- I win.

47:20.960 --> 47:22.979
- Sucked in. Get... get wrecked!
- (LAUGHS)

47:22.985 --> 47:24.796
- Get wrecked!
- I let you win. I let you win.

47:24.802 --> 47:26.399
- No, you didn't.
- Okay, start again.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.839
- Stop. Stop! Oh!
- Start again. Go, go, go!

47:28.840 --> 47:31.599
- Go away. Come on. Go on. Go.
- You're hopeless.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.455
- Me? Oh, nuh.
- You're done, mate. You're done.

47:33.461 --> 47:35.661
- I'm just starting.
- You're done.

47:38.520 --> 47:40.400
(PHONE VIBRATES)

47:49.320 --> 47:50.799
Hey, Clay?

47:50.800 --> 47:53.800
Rich, mate, I'd like to go over
a couple of things for tomorrow.

47:54.800 --> 47:57.239
Yeah. Anything. Fire away.

47:57.240 --> 47:58.799
Why don't you brush
your teeth, get in bed

47:58.800 --> 48:00.254
and I'll read you the
rest of that story.

48:00.260 --> 48:01.777
Come on, but you promised we'd
finish this level. Come on.

48:01.783 --> 48:03.783
- Just get to bed. I'll...
- You promised!

48:03.789 --> 48:05.385
Just give me a second and I'll...

48:08.520 --> 48:11.895
- Mate, um, I was thinking...
- (BANGING AT DOOR)

48:12.960 --> 48:14.680
Just give me a sec, would ya?

48:26.160 --> 48:28.679
Rich, I'll call you back, mate.

48:28.680 --> 48:30.080
See ya.

49:16.440 --> 49:18.439
It's okay, Dad. I don't
need a story tonight.

49:18.440 --> 49:19.640
Eh?

49:19.920 --> 49:21.559
What are you talking about?

49:21.560 --> 49:23.277
There's just a few chapters left.

49:23.840 --> 49:26.200
- You sure?
- Yeah.

49:33.920 --> 49:37.320
"If I'd told anyone
a few short weeks ago

49:37.582 --> 49:40.062
"that things would've worked
out the way they have...

49:41.049 --> 49:43.129
"I would have been called delusional...

49:45.795 --> 49:49.125
"at worst, insane.

49:51.590 --> 49:53.470
"But I can't deny reality.

49:54.156 --> 49:58.160
"What seemed far-fetched not
long ago has come to pass."

50:36.160 --> 50:38.599
TV REPORTER: Oliver Pittman,
what does it feel like?

50:38.600 --> 50:40.279
Good.

50:40.280 --> 50:43.359
- Who's your favourite player?
- Clay Nelson.

50:43.360 --> 50:44.560
I mean, it's Clay Nelson.

50:44.560 --> 50:45.680
I didn't want to.

50:45.681 --> 50:49.560
And when he's calling you every
night of the week, you have to.

50:51.080 --> 50:52.599
But Clay's Clay.

50:52.600 --> 50:54.559
- Who's your favourite player?
- Clay Nelson.

50:54.560 --> 50:56.520
OLDER OLIVER: It's Clay Nelson.

(WOMAN SCREAMS)

52:15.235 --> 52:20.559
Synced and corrected by PetaG & Dragoniod for
- www.addic7ed.com -

52:35.040 --> 52:36.599
He was about to come
clean about his role

52:36.600 --> 52:38.319
in a multi-million-dollar betting scam.

52:38.320 --> 52:40.119
He must have realised it
was only a matter of time

52:40.120 --> 52:41.519
before he was publicly disgraced.

52:41.520 --> 52:42.999
Maxine Reynolds,

52:43.000 --> 52:45.079
she managed both Clay
Nelson and Nate Baldwin.

52:45.080 --> 52:47.919
I mean, my clients, Nate and
Clay, they are fine young men...

52:47.920 --> 52:52.074
Who are both associated with suspect
sport betting and match fixing.

52:52.090 --> 52:53.985
Nate Baldwin's just killed
one of his teammates.

52:53.991 --> 52:55.239
- What?
- We have no further comment.

52:55.240 --> 52:56.879
Have you seen the video
of Tyler Perati's sister?

52:56.880 --> 52:58.319
What was your involvement
in the incident?

52:58.320 --> 53:00.079
And the events of this
morning have no way steered you

53:00.080 --> 53:01.479
towards this particular line of enquiry?

53:01.480 --> 53:02.799
Facts have steered me, Tony. You are...

53:02.800 --> 53:06.117
You cannot go gallivanting off
after your personal vendetta!
