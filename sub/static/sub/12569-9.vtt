The more important

00:40.230 --> 00:41.292

you both just sit around

00:43.795 --> 00:46.046

something as sweet as you are.

07:46.050 --> 07:47.051
And speaking

07:47.052 --> 07:48.052
of sweet,

07:48.093 --> 07:49.575
way to rock

07:49.576 --> 07:51.055
that pantsuit.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.745
Oh, why, thank you.

07:52.746 --> 07:54.392
I got it when I bid

07:51.096 --> 07:54.392
on a storage locker.

07:58.062 --> 07:59.980
All right, class.

08:00.022 --> 08:04.109
Tell me, what do we see here?

08:05.110 --> 08:06.695
Anyone?

08:06.737 --> 08:08.488
Well, I see Paris,

08:09.614 --> 08:11.158
I see France.

08:12.410 --> 08:13.827
Zuri Ross.

08:15.037 --> 08:17.039
Tell me, what do you see?

08:22.378 --> 08:24.568
So help me, you do not

08:24.569 --> 08:26.757
see anyone's underpants!

08:26.798 --> 08:28.967
I see a country

08:28.968 --> 08:31.136
known for its

08:26.798 --> 08:31.136
Gothic architecture,

08:31.178 --> 08:32.701
haute cuisine, and

08:32.702 --> 08:34.222
modernist philosophy.

08:34.265 --> 08:35.850
And a vision of loveliness

08:35.851 --> 08:37.434
standing next to it.

08:39.437 --> 08:41.251
Zuri Ross, I don't

08:41.251 --> 08:43.065
know what shenanigans

08:39.437 --> 08:43.065
you're trying to pull,

08:44.483 --> 08:45.984
but it's not going to work.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.320
Excusez-moi?

08:47.321 --> 08:48.612
I am just eager to learn.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.696
Oui, oui?

08:49.738 --> 08:50.761
(GASPS) Toilet talk?

08:50.762 --> 08:51.782
That's it.

08:51.823 --> 08:52.950
Corner, now.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.140
What? Zuri's been

08:56.141 --> 08:57.704
a perfect angel all day!

08:54.576 --> 08:57.704
That's not fair.

08:57.746 --> 08:58.977
Oh, and now it's you

08:58.978 --> 09:00.207
who's being disruptive.

09:00.249 --> 09:01.584
Jessie Prescott,

09:01.585 --> 09:02.918
you're on the Naughty Board.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.649
(GASPS) But... No, wait.

09:04.650 --> 09:06.338
I've never had my name

09:02.960 --> 09:06.338
on the Naughty Board!

09:06.380 --> 09:07.965
All of my teachers loved me.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.734
- Well, then you must
- have been home schooled.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.009
(GASPS)

09:11.051 --> 09:13.553
You! Corner! Now!

09:13.595 --> 09:15.031
- But nobody puts
- Jessie in the corner!

09:15.055 --> 09:16.307
- Oh. (CHUCKLES)
- Except you.

09:20.644 --> 09:21.749
LUKE: I can't believe

09:21.750 --> 09:22.854
you cleaned my room.

09:24.106 --> 09:25.690
- Oh, now what
- are you doing?

09:25.732 --> 09:27.651
Burning sage rids the room

09:27.652 --> 09:29.569
of negative energy.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.884
And hopefully,

09:30.885 --> 09:32.156
that lingering

09:29.611 --> 09:32.156
armpit smell.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.555
Uh, hello?

09:35.556 --> 09:36.743
That is my manly musk.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.080
More like boyish B.O.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.096
Do you mind?

09:57.639 --> 09:59.266
- I'm trying
- to read pictures.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.811
- Can't you just make up
- with Mrs. Kipling?

10:02.853 --> 10:04.229
(CHANTS) No.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.650
RAVI: No.

10:08.692 --> 10:09.860
Oh, great.

10:09.861 --> 10:11.028
Now I lost my place.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.864
(ALARM RINGS)

10:14.281 --> 10:15.407
Ah.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.201
(GROWLS)

10:17.242 --> 10:18.807
Now see, Mrs. K.

10:18.808 --> 10:20.371
Isn't this more fun than

10:17.242 --> 10:20.371
hanging out with my shoes?

10:21.413 --> 10:23.415
(SCOFFS) What am I saying?

10:23.457 --> 10:24.667
Nothing is more fun

10:24.668 --> 10:25.876
than hanging out with

10:23.457 --> 10:25.876
my shoes. (CHUCKLES)

10:27.127 --> 10:28.295
(GROWLS)

10:28.337 --> 10:30.006
I know! This pink nail

10:30.007 --> 10:31.673
color is supes cute!

10:31.715 --> 10:32.967
I'd lend it to you,

10:32.968 --> 10:34.218
but that would be crazy.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.677
Because you're an autumn.

10:37.555 --> 10:39.390
- Well, I really should go
- do some homework.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.228
Ooh, you're right!

10:44.269 --> 10:45.876
An animal print belt

10:45.877 --> 10:47.481
would look great

10:44.269 --> 10:47.481
with this robe.

10:47.523 --> 10:49.066
Okay, I guess we can

10:49.067 --> 10:50.609
go shopping again.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.424
But, only if you

10:52.425 --> 10:54.196
promise not to eat

10:50.650 --> 10:54.196
any more mannequins.

10:54.238 --> 10:55.280
(GROWLS)

10:58.742 --> 10:59.910
So class,

10:59.911 --> 11:01.078
your science project

10:58.742 --> 11:01.078
this afternoon

11:01.119 --> 11:02.851
will be to prove that

11:02.852 --> 11:04.582

11:01.119 --> 11:04.582
actually couldn't.

Lunch!

11:10.295 --> 11:11.401
Jessie, run!

11:11.402 --> 11:12.506
Save yourself!

11:12.548 --> 11:13.778
No! I'm going

11:13.779 --> 11:15.008
to make her like me,

11:15.050 --> 11:16.531
uh, for your sake,

11:16.532 --> 11:18.011
of course.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.138
I trust you've finished

11:19.139 --> 11:20.222
your sentences?

11:20.264 --> 11:21.619
Yes. I wrote "Teacher's aides

11:21.620 --> 11:22.974
should be seen, and not heard"

11:23.016 --> 11:25.018

know how to make

11:25.060 --> 11:28.480
a cursive "B."

11:33.068 --> 11:34.069
Hey, why don't

11:34.070 --> 11:35.070
I sweep your classroom?

11:35.112 --> 11:36.593
Put that down!

11:36.594 --> 11:38.073
That's not a broom,

11:38.115 --> 11:39.158

- what we're talking about.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.001
I play Muggle Quidditch.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.900
Oh! Oh, right, right.

11:51.901 --> 11:53.755
Firebolt, yeah.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.633
It's been a while

11:55.634 --> 11:57.468
since I hopped on one

11:53.797 --> 11:57.468
of these bad boys.

12:01.097 --> 12:03.098
I love Mug Quib... (STAMMERS)

12:03.140 --> 12:05.434
what you said.

12:05.476 --> 12:06.685
Did you know? I used

12:06.686 --> 12:07.894
to be on an official team,

12:07.936 --> 12:09.521
till everyone started leaving

12:09.522 --> 12:11.106
to play Vampire Baseball.

12:11.148 --> 12:12.983

Ever since the Long Island

12:25.954 --> 12:27.060
I've been in a bit

12:27.061 --> 12:28.165
of a bad mood.

12:29.667 --> 12:30.875
Really?

12:30.917 --> 12:32.670
- Yeah, I don't think
- anyone noticed.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.506
- Hey!
- Mmm-hmm.

12:35.547 --> 12:36.570
Would you want to play

12:36.571 --> 12:37.591

12:35.547 --> 12:37.591
this weekend?

12:37.633 --> 12:40.302
Uh, man, I would love to.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.283
But, you know,

I have all these

12:40.344 --> 12:44.222
sentences to rewrite.

Oh, forget

12:44.264 --> 12:46.308
about those!

- What? Then I'd better
- leave now! (CHUCKLES)

12:57.902 --> 12:59.839
- So, you got to help me
- get Ravi out of my room!

12:59.863 --> 13:01.532
He won't stop cleaning!

13:01.573 --> 13:03.013
Give him a few years.

13:03.014 --> 13:04.451
He'll give up, like I did.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.579
And Mrs. Kipling

13:07.580 --> 13:09.122
is driving me crazy!

13:09.164 --> 13:10.187
I had to spend all day

13:10.188 --> 13:11.208
with her in the makeup

13:09.164 --> 13:11.208
department,

13:11.249 --> 13:13.294
and it's official.

13:13.295 --> 13:15.337
There's no way to match

13:11.249 --> 13:15.337
her scale tone!

13:15.379 --> 13:16.818
We've got to find a way

13:16.819 --> 13:18.256
to get those two crazy kids

13:15.379 --> 13:18.256
back together,

13:18.298 --> 13:19.425
before Ravi makes me

13:19.426 --> 13:20.551
look at paint swatches.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.260
- I don't even know
- what a swatch is,

13:22.302 --> 13:23.303
And I'd like

13:23.304 --> 13:24.304
to keep it that way!

13:25.430 --> 13:27.098
- Come on,
- please help us!

13:27.140 --> 13:28.371
Fine. But, what's

13:28.372 --> 13:29.601
in it for me?

13:36.066 --> 13:37.067
A gazillion is not

13:37.068 --> 13:38.068
a real number.

13:42.573 --> 13:43.908
Hey, Zuri. Can we talk

13:43.909 --> 13:45.242
about Ms. Falkenberg?

13:45.283 --> 13:46.368
Yeah. I don't know

13:46.369 --> 13:47.452
what you said to her,

13:47.494 --> 13:48.996
but she was in the best

13:52.125 --> 13:53.709
is to watch TV.

13:53.751 --> 13:55.148
Which, ironically,

13:55.149 --> 13:56.545
makes me not

13:53.751 --> 13:56.545
want to do it.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.528
Yeah. She's been

13:59.529 --> 14:00.591
texting me a lot.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.134
I wanted to get her

14:02.135 --> 14:03.635
to like me, but I think

14:00.632 --> 14:03.635
I may have overdone it.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.408
Don't panic.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.138
Even if she is

14:03.677 --> 14:07.138
a level five clinger,

14:07.180 --> 14:09.057
- it's not like she
- knows where we live.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.183
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

14:10.225 --> 14:11.727
I found you.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.980
Uh-oh. She might

14:14.981 --> 14:16.565
be a level six.

- records, silly!

Apparently

14:23.782 --> 14:24.823
not so confidential.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.054
Hey, I thought we could

14:26.055 --> 14:27.242
go over some team plays,

14:27.284 --> 14:28.556
so we can dive

14:28.557 --> 14:29.828
right in at Quidditch

14:27.284 --> 14:29.828

14:29.869 --> 14:30.892
Ah.

Hey, star student.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.540

- you watching TV?

14:38.336 --> 14:42.466
a good time.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.301
I'm so sorry.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.282
I guess I'm just so glad

that I finally found

- Hey.

- That's right.

- Okay.

15:09.493 --> 15:10.515
This is working

15:10.516 --> 15:11.536
out great!

15:11.578 --> 15:13.330
Uh, for you!

15:13.371 --> 15:14.515
- Ms. Falkenberg and I - don't
have anything - In common.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.291
You have me in common.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.688
And if you want

15:17.689 --> 15:19.043
me to keep being

15:16.333 --> 15:19.043
a "star student,"

15:19.085 --> 15:20.942
you're going to jump

15:20.943 --> 15:22.798
on that broom tomorrow

15:19.085 --> 15:22.798
and work it like a Pureblood.

15:31.723 --> 15:32.871
Hey, friend!

15:32.872 --> 15:34.017
Hey, friend.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.186
Quick question.

15:36.187 --> 15:38.313
Why does my cape

15:34.058 --> 15:38.313
say "Furtenfurter?"

15:38.355 --> 15:39.607
Oh, I thought

15:39.608 --> 15:40.858
you said that was

15:38.355 --> 15:40.858
your Quidditch name?

15:40.899 --> 15:42.360
No, that was a sneeze.

15:42.361 --> 15:43.819
Oh.

15:43.861 --> 15:45.154
Hey, where are

15:45.155 --> 15:46.446
your other friends?

15:43.861 --> 15:46.446
Oh. What other friends?

15:46.488 --> 15:48.239
- Oh.
- (IN DEEP VOICE) Oh.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.036
Here. Sorry, you have

15:52.037 --> 15:53.662
to practice with my old

15:50.408 --> 15:53.662
Cleansweep Eleven.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.623
But who knows maybe

15:55.624 --> 15:57.541
one day you'll work your way

15:53.704 --> 15:57.541
up to one of these babies.

15:57.582 --> 15:58.625
(CHUCKLES)

15:58.667 --> 16:00.377
- A girl can dream.
- (CHUCKLES)

16:01.586 --> 16:02.754
Okay. Now,

16:02.755 --> 16:03.922
remember the rules.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.154
No blagging, blurting,

16:06.155 --> 16:08.343
blatching, haversacking,

16:03.963 --> 16:08.343
or quaffle-pocking.

16:08.886 --> 16:10.595
Obviously.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.910
But if you could

16:11.911 --> 16:13.181
just refresh my...

16:10.637 --> 16:13.181
Brooms up!

16:13.223 --> 16:14.391
Uh, okay.

16:14.432 --> 16:15.934
Ow!

16:15.975 --> 16:17.937
Ow! Foul! I think

16:17.938 --> 16:19.897
I've just been blag-boozled

16:15.975 --> 16:19.897
or something!

16:19.938 --> 16:21.523
That was not a foul!

16:21.565 --> 16:22.817
Beaters throw Bludgers

16:22.818 --> 16:24.067
at Chasers to make them

16:21.565 --> 16:24.067
drop Quaffles.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.862
That's only Quidditch 101.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.676
Yeah, yeah. Can...

16:28.677 --> 16:30.448
Can we go back to

16:26.904 --> 16:30.448
Quidditch 911?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.367
- I think I broke
- my furtenfurter.

16:33.618 --> 16:34.619
You know what?

16:34.620 --> 16:35.620
You seem a little rusty.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.102
Hey, why don't you try

16:37.103 --> 16:38.540
playing the Golden Snitch?

16:38.582 --> 16:39.687
(SIGHS) Does that

16:39.688 --> 16:40.792
mean I get to

16:38.582 --> 16:40.792
change clothes?

16:45.672 --> 16:46.924
There, Perfect.

16:48.926 --> 16:50.219
Yeah, this just makes

16:50.220 --> 16:51.511
the whole thing work.

16:53.471 --> 16:54.869
You know what?

16:54.870 --> 16:56.266
I don't want to

16:53.471 --> 16:56.266
talk about it.

16:56.307 --> 16:57.351
Brooms up!

16:57.352 --> 16:58.393
Well, I don't

16:56.307 --> 16:58.393
have a broom.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.561
(YELLS)

17:00.562 --> 17:02.439
I snatched the Snitch!

17:05.275 --> 17:06.297
I can't believe

17:06.298 --> 17:07.318
they let children

17:05.275 --> 17:07.318
play Quidditch.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.465
Is Professor Dumbledore

17:08.467 --> 17:09.570
aware of how dangerous

17:07.359 --> 17:09.570
it is?

17:10.906 --> 17:11.949
You just have

17:11.950 --> 17:12.991
to last until June.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.722
Hopefully my next teacher

17:14.723 --> 17:16.411
will be into something safer,

17:16.453 --> 17:17.829
like cliff diving.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.707
Zuri.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.002
- I can't keep being
- Ms. Falkenberg's friend.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.545
What? Why not?

17:25.587 --> 17:27.214
Uh, maybe because

17:27.214 --> 17:28.840
she makes me ride

17:25.587 --> 17:28.840
a broom in public,

17:28.882 --> 17:30.279
and yell things like,

17:30.280 --> 17:31.676
"For the glory

17:28.882 --> 17:31.676
of Hufflepuff!"

17:32.970 --> 17:34.492
But Jessie, you saw

17:34.493 --> 17:36.014
what she was like before.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.515
If you break up with her,

17:37.557 --> 17:39.080
I'll have to go back

17:39.081 --> 17:40.602
to slumming it

17:37.557 --> 17:40.602
in the corner,

17:40.644 --> 17:41.833
which is really close

17:41.834 --> 17:43.021
to Gassy Gus!

17:43.062 --> 17:46.691
What is that kid eating?

17:46.733 --> 17:47.922
Look, I just feel

17:47.923 --> 17:49.110
bad about lying

17:46.733 --> 17:49.110
to Ms. Falkenberg.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.112
- She's actually
- a nice person,

17:51.154 --> 17:52.843
And she deserves a real

17:52.844 --> 17:54.532
best friend who genuinely

17:51.154 --> 17:54.532
shares her interests.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.742
Yeah, yeah.

17:55.784 --> 17:56.993
Can't you just learn

17:56.994 --> 17:58.202
to like Quidditch?

17:58.244 --> 17:59.722
- Can't you just learn
- to like vegetables?

17:59.746 --> 18:01.247
I see your point.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.752
I got your text, roomie.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.108
Did you not understand

18:07.109 --> 18:08.421
the vacuuming schedule?

18:10.465 --> 18:11.800
Mrs. Kipling.

18:11.801 --> 18:13.134
Come on!

18:13.176 --> 18:14.678
- (GRUNTS)
- Get out here.

18:14.719 --> 18:15.887
What are you

18:15.888 --> 18:17.055
people doing?

18:17.096 --> 18:18.619
I told you, Mrs. Kipling

18:18.620 --> 18:20.141
and I are not talking!

18:20.183 --> 18:21.789
You're not leaving

18:21.790 --> 18:23.394
this room until you talk

18:20.183 --> 18:23.394
through your problems.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.646
(GROWLS)

18:24.688 --> 18:26.169
There is nothing

18:26.170 --> 18:27.649
to talk about.

18:27.691 --> 18:28.838
Mrs. Kipling

18:28.839 --> 18:29.985
and I have just...

18:30.027 --> 18:31.653
Just grown apart.

18:31.654 --> 18:33.279
It is over.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.594
Well, maybe you

18:34.595 --> 18:35.866
dodged a bullet, Ravi.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.326
Mrs. Kipling is pretty

18:37.327 --> 18:38.743
needy and clingy.

18:38.785 --> 18:39.912
Yeah, I don't know

18:39.913 --> 18:41.038
how you put up

18:38.785 --> 18:41.038
with her for so long.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.477
Me neither,

18:42.478 --> 18:43.874
it's always

18:41.079 --> 18:43.874
all about her.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.292
"I need a walk,

18:45.293 --> 18:46.668
I want my claws filed,

18:46.710 --> 18:47.795
"I ordered this rat

18:47.796 --> 18:48.879
medium rare."

18:48.920 --> 18:51.130
She is a terrible friend.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.424
Now just hold on a moment.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.989
Mrs. K has not

18:54.990 --> 18:56.511
been a bad friend.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.096
She has just been

18:58.097 --> 18:59.639
a little down

18:56.553 --> 18:59.639
in the swamps lately.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.100
A little? I asked her

19:01.101 --> 19:02.517
to quit being such a diva,

19:02.559 --> 19:03.894
and she almost bit

19:03.895 --> 19:05.228
my head off, literally!

19:06.354 --> 19:07.731
Yeah, you don't need

19:07.732 --> 19:09.107
to defend her, Ravi.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.650
Lizards be crazy.

19:13.070 --> 19:15.030
Enough!

19:15.072 --> 19:16.615
Mrs. Kipling is the most

19:16.616 --> 19:18.157
loyal, funny, supportive

19:15.072 --> 19:18.157
best friend

19:18.199 --> 19:19.556
there has ever been!

19:19.557 --> 19:20.911
(SIGHS)

19:20.952 --> 19:22.350
Come on, Mrs. K,

19:22.351 --> 19:23.747
we are going home!

19:28.376 --> 19:29.544
ALL: Yes!

19:29.586 --> 19:31.088
(ALL CHUCKLING)

19:31.129 --> 19:32.630
- Nice.
- It worked!

19:32.672 --> 19:34.653
Bertram, you actually

19:34.654 --> 19:36.634
had a good idea!

19:36.676 --> 19:38.678
And after that rutabaga

19:38.679 --> 19:40.680
casserole, you really

19:36.676 --> 19:40.680
needed a win.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.474
Well, I felt appreciated

19:42.475 --> 19:44.225
for almost five seconds.

19:40.722 --> 19:44.225
Thanks for that.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.209
BTW, Mrs. Kipling

19:48.210 --> 19:50.732
and I just figured out

19:45.685 --> 19:50.732
what happened in here.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.358
(GROWLS)

19:52.400 --> 19:53.902
And we love you for it!

19:56.571 --> 19:58.073
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

19:58.115 --> 19:59.387
Okay, everybody.

19:59.388 --> 20:00.658
Do your homework

19:58.115 --> 20:00.658
if you feel like it!

20:00.700 --> 20:02.410
Okay, no pressure.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.330
Sorry, sorry. Okay.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.916
Hey, friend.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.377
Okay. I'm ready

20:10.378 --> 20:11.586
for practice.

20:11.628 --> 20:12.880
And I know I broke

20:12.881 --> 20:14.131
your Cleansweep Eleven,

20:11.628 --> 20:14.131
so I hope it's okay

20:14.172 --> 20:15.549
that I brought this

20:15.550 --> 20:16.925
Schmutz Buster 5000.

20:16.967 --> 20:18.489
Yeah, um,

20:18.490 --> 20:20.011
about that, uh...

20:20.053 --> 20:21.367
I don't need you

20:21.368 --> 20:22.680
to come to practice today.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.183
But, why? Is my broom grip

20:24.184 --> 20:25.642
not as bad as we thought?

20:25.683 --> 20:27.206
(CHUCKLES)

20:27.207 --> 20:28.728
No, it is.

20:25.683 --> 20:28.728
Okay.

20:28.770 --> 20:30.251
I'm gonna practice

20:30.252 --> 20:31.731
with Mr. Itzel today.

20:31.773 --> 20:32.796
Mr. Itzel?

20:32.797 --> 20:33.817
The librarian?

20:33.858 --> 20:35.652
- Yes. Can you believe
- he was a Beater

20:35.693 --> 20:36.861
For the Central Park

20:36.862 --> 20:38.029
Centaurs! How hot is that?

20:40.157 --> 20:41.512
I'm tingling, but...

20:41.513 --> 20:42.867
(STAMMERING)

20:42.909 --> 20:44.828
Honey, no offense,

20:44.829 --> 20:46.746
but, come on,

20:42.909 --> 20:46.746
you're a rotten Chaser,

20:46.788 --> 20:48.873
a horrible Keeper,

20:48.915 --> 20:50.376
and just a few Horcruxes

20:50.377 --> 20:51.835
short of a soul. If you

20:48.915 --> 20:51.835
know what I mean.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.211
I do not.

20:54.796 --> 20:55.819
And I thought I made

20:55.820 --> 20:56.840
a really good Snootch.

21:01.178 --> 21:02.512
Brooms up!

21:03.471 --> 21:04.681
(CHUCKLES)

21:08.226 --> 21:09.332
I can't believe

21:09.333 --> 21:10.436
Ms. Falkenberg

21:08.226 --> 21:10.436
dumped me!

21:10.478 --> 21:12.558
- For someone who sunburns
- in fluorescent lighting.

21:13.023 --> 21:15.233
I can. I set them up.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.068
You did? Why?

21:17.110 --> 21:18.154
Well, I thought

21:18.155 --> 21:19.196
about how you said

21:19.237 --> 21:20.593
Ms. Falkenberg

21:20.594 --> 21:21.948
deserved a real

21:19.237 --> 21:21.948
best friend.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.826
And when I saw

21:23.827 --> 21:25.660
how unhappy Ravi was

21:21.990 --> 21:25.660
without his best friend,

21:25.702 --> 21:27.725
I knew I had to

21:27.726 --> 21:29.747
find Ms. Falkenberg

21:25.702 --> 21:29.747
her Mrs. Kipling.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.417
Oh. But how did

21:31.418 --> 21:33.043
you know Mr. Itzel

21:29.789 --> 21:33.043
would be a perfect match?

21:33.084 --> 21:34.649
He wears little

21:34.650 --> 21:36.213
round glasses,

21:33.084 --> 21:36.213
an owl sweater,

21:36.254 --> 21:38.069
and calls his minivan

21:38.070 --> 21:39.883
the Hogwarts Express.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.509
I took a wild guess.

21:43.178 --> 21:45.138
- Oh, that was very
- sweet of you, Zuri.

21:45.180 --> 21:46.744
You're not really upset

21:46.745 --> 21:48.307
that you got dumped,

21:45.180 --> 21:48.307
are you?

21:48.349 --> 21:50.060
Nah. Nah.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.645
At least this break-up

21:51.646 --> 21:53.188
didn't involve my birthday

21:50.101 --> 21:53.188
and a jumbotron.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.191
She'll miss me.

21:56.233 --> 21:57.942
They always miss me.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.077
What happened in here?

22:07.118 --> 22:08.912
Surprise!

22:08.953 --> 22:10.538
I wanted to thank you

22:10.539 --> 22:12.123
for letting me crash

22:08.953 --> 22:12.123
at your bachelor pad.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.791
So let me get this straight.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.064
You and Mrs. Kipling

22:15.065 --> 22:16.294
waited for me to leave

22:13.833 --> 22:16.294
the apartment,

22:16.335 --> 22:18.046
then came back in here

22:18.047 --> 22:19.756
and trashed my room

22:16.335 --> 22:19.756
to thank me?

22:19.797 --> 22:20.798
That is correct.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.635
Dude, you are

22:23.636 --> 22:24.928
the best brother ever!

22:24.969 --> 22:26.137
I know, right?

22:26.179 --> 22:27.723
Maybe the three of us

22:27.724 --> 22:29.266
should room together!

22:29.307 --> 22:30.641
Get out.
