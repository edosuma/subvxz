WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:04.672
* Followed by the dead

00:04.705 --> 00:09.143
* On the way to mercy

00:09.177 --> 00:13.147
* In the leper's head

00:13.181 --> 00:15.249
* In the after hours

00:15.283 --> 00:18.186
WOMAN:
I get a call 7:00 a.m.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.453
Owner's walking
some developer through.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.455
Thought all that money dried up.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.690
Oil hasn't.

00:22.723 --> 00:26.260
The guy's from Abu Dhabi or some
Persian whosits or wherever.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.529
He wants to turn this rat-hole
into downtown lofts.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.699
For rich kids playing
starving artists.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.135
The point is,
this was my day off.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.406
Was this stuff here before?

00:38.439 --> 00:40.141
I think it came
with the package.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.376
OFFICER: Maybe he didn't want
to bother the neighbors.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.145
Could have done me
the same favor.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.080
I got to clean all this up.

00:46.114 --> 00:50.351
* Till the night turns blue

00:57.591 --> 00:59.127
(gun clicks)

00:59.160 --> 01:00.861
OFFICER: Found the first one two
days ago.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.797
Same pedigree,
same decorating sense.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.866
And in both cases,
the only prints on the gun

01:05.899 --> 01:06.834
were the victim's.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.702
Gun only had one bullet?

01:08.736 --> 01:10.571
Guess these guys
are on a budget.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.606
All we're missing
are the black high-tops.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.143
Must be some cult thing, right?

01:15.176 --> 01:17.711
* The night turns blue

01:27.355 --> 01:28.856
DETECTIVE:
Four days, three bodies.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.558
Single shot through the head.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.360
Past nine months,
there's been a similar series

01:32.393 --> 01:33.761
of bodies turning up.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.497
Miami, Houston, Denver.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.866
It's three cities,
seven men each time.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.202
Looks like we've got
ourselves a serial killer.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.770
Who's seen too many
Saw movies.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.772
This time, he left
something behind.

01:46.707 --> 01:47.908
Those cables?

01:47.941 --> 01:50.211
To a video camera.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.612
Somebody's making a movie.

01:51.645 --> 01:52.880
Yeah, the victim
pulled the trigger,

01:52.913 --> 01:54.682
but this wasn't a suicide.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.284
Somebody was watching him,

01:56.317 --> 01:58.552
enjoying the show.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.822
* The night turns blue

02:05.393 --> 02:06.294
(gunshot)

02:12.900 --> 02:16.204
(chuckles) I knew that
that lecture was a bad idea.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.205
Oh, come on.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.872
I-I needed a date.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.708
Amita's out of town
on a conference.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.510
The Royal
Astronomical Society.

02:22.543 --> 02:23.877
You love the Royal
Astronomical Society.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.847
Yeah, well, I did love
the Royal Astronomical Society.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.283
Why are you going into
such a tailspin over this?

02:29.317 --> 02:30.718
I'm not in a tailspin, Earth is.

02:30.751 --> 02:31.952
Icarus-like.

02:31.985 --> 02:32.986
We're soon fated

02:33.020 --> 02:35.623
to tumble from orbit
and be engulfed by the sun

02:35.656 --> 02:36.857
in some vaporous death.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.292
ALAN:
What am I missing?

02:38.326 --> 02:39.860
Do I have to wait
for Larry King?

02:39.893 --> 02:41.629
The Royal
Astronomical Society

02:41.662 --> 02:44.732
published a paper recalculating
the demise of the Earth

02:44.765 --> 02:46.500
and shortening its lifespan

02:46.534 --> 02:47.835
considerably.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.837
We've got another
7.59 billion years.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.373
You know, with these pills
I've been taking,

02:52.406 --> 02:53.907
I might be around then.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.509
Well, given the
evolutionary trajectory,

02:55.543 --> 02:58.479
you may be the
only one who is.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.713
What is this?

02:59.747 --> 03:03.384
These brokerage accounts
and bank statements?

03:03.417 --> 03:04.852
I'm, uh, just wallowing.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.454
I've joined the ranks of those

03:06.487 --> 03:08.989
who've seen their 401k's
turn into 201k's.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.958
It's all my fault--
trusting this financial guy

03:10.991 --> 03:12.460
who told me that shopping malls

03:12.493 --> 03:14.462
in Orange Country were
the next sure thing.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.230
How much have you lost?

03:16.264 --> 03:18.299
I still have my city pension.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.234
I think.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.505
DAVID: We checked out
the soundproofing

03:24.538 --> 03:26.907
and blackout material--
all common stuff you can find

03:26.940 --> 03:28.609
at any home improvement store.

03:28.642 --> 03:29.643
And the guns?

03:29.677 --> 03:31.312
All stolen, a dead end.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.546
If we're looking
at a serial killer,

03:32.580 --> 03:35.583
they are equal opportunity--
victims are all over the map.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.251
Yeah, different ages,
ethnicities.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.886
One thing in common:
they all seem to have suffered

03:38.919 --> 03:40.588
financial setbacks recently.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.656
- Who hasn't?
- Our first victim's wife

03:42.690 --> 03:44.458
caught him visiting
online sites,

03:44.492 --> 03:46.994
adult services classifieds.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.829
She accused him of blowing
their savings on hookers.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.331
Certain names showed up a lot--

03:50.364 --> 03:53.267
uh, "Layla, 750 bucks,"
"Carol, 500."

03:53.301 --> 03:55.035
We're checking the other
victims' computers to see if

03:55.068 --> 03:56.404
we find the same kind of story.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.405
Could be that our killer

03:57.438 --> 03:58.672
is meeting these guys online

03:58.706 --> 03:59.707
through these classifieds.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.874
All right. Keep me posted.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.917
DON: Retirement:
Your Savings And You.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.852
- So, w-what are you doing?
- Investment portfolios.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.888
You know, Dad invested
his retirement savings

04:14.922 --> 04:17.958
with some genius who blew
it on strip malls.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.060
We're, like, going to have
to bail him out.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.795
You know, I had a lot of money
with that guy, too.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.532
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.033
I-I make a decent enough salary,
I can swing it.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.868
I'm just going to have
to talk to him.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.337
Yeah, good luck with that.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.472
So, did you get to the stuff
I sent you?

04:31.505 --> 04:32.806
You know,
there's not a lot to see.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.508
I mean, there's a serious
dearth of data

04:34.542 --> 04:37.010
in these files, which is why
I began looking for answers

04:37.044 --> 04:39.012
in the desert.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.614
That was on Larry's desk, right?

04:40.648 --> 04:42.683
He's got me babysitting it.

04:42.716 --> 04:43.917
- He's a restless soul, huh?
- Sure is.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.686
Sort of like your three victims.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.322
Like everyone,
they move through the city

04:48.356 --> 04:50.524
leaving trails, forensic data,
marking where they've been,

04:50.558 --> 04:51.692
like ATM visits,

04:51.725 --> 04:53.927
cell phone calls,
credit card purchases.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.664
But serial killers
are very opportunistic;

04:56.697 --> 04:58.966
they choose victims
where they see victims,

04:58.999 --> 05:00.968
like around where they live
or around where they work.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.636
So, I'm going to use
geographic profiling

05:02.670 --> 05:03.837
to examine the forensic data,

05:03.871 --> 05:05.939
see where these three victims
might have crossed paths.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.541
If I can find
their intersection,

05:07.575 --> 05:09.309
then I can find the killer.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.981
Glad to see my own Zen garden's
inspired you.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.484
Been a while since it did
anything for me.

05:16.517 --> 05:20.020
Maybe the change of scenery
is giving it new relevance.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.054
Chalk up another victory

05:21.088 --> 05:23.056
to de-cluttering.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.092
Which, uh, if I remember right,

05:25.125 --> 05:27.428
you said was a prelude
to leaving.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.663
And your point is?

05:29.697 --> 05:30.664
You cleaned out your office,

05:30.698 --> 05:33.100
you divested yourself
of your academic duties,

05:33.133 --> 05:34.568
and yet you're still here.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.069
Am I missing something?

05:36.103 --> 05:37.771
Leaving is a process.

05:37.805 --> 05:41.074
Uh, lightening one's load is
the first of many paving stones

05:41.108 --> 05:42.009
that have to be laid.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.577
I'm dwelling in the moment.

05:43.611 --> 05:44.945
(computer chirping)
And the moment

05:44.978 --> 05:46.447
is here.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.016
We got something.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.719
A four-block radius
where all three victims

05:51.752 --> 05:53.721
made credit card purchases.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.088
Lee Stoyer

05:55.122 --> 05:58.091
charged $37 for gasoline
at a filling station,

05:58.125 --> 05:59.627
just a few blocks from a deli

05:59.660 --> 06:01.028
where Edward Mendez
bought a sandwich

06:01.061 --> 06:03.063
- and coffee.
- And down the street

06:03.096 --> 06:05.933
from a Quick-mart where
Martin Hedges purchased

06:05.966 --> 06:07.100
lotto tickets and cigarettes.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.069
Do you have that list
of I.P. addresses

06:09.102 --> 06:10.838
that Don sent over?

06:10.871 --> 06:14.141
The online erotic services sites
frequented by the decedents.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.843
Here it is.

06:15.876 --> 06:19.012
As I recall, Carol and Layla
were particular favorites.

06:19.046 --> 06:19.980
(typing)

06:20.013 --> 06:23.584
Here's the location
for that I.P. address.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.086
(pop music playing,
men chattering)

06:26.119 --> 06:28.121
(loud whistling)

06:29.823 --> 06:30.758
MAN:
Oh, yeah!

06:32.460 --> 06:35.062
I hope the Jell-O shots
have penicillin in 'em.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.564
Come on, Granger.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.566
They don't have places like this
back in Utah?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.033
- Idaho.
- Idaho.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.635
(man whooping,
indistinct chatter)

06:52.179 --> 06:54.548
You boys look like
you've been underappreciated.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.584
How about we start
with a drink?

06:56.617 --> 06:58.452
Well, we're here on business.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.854
Federal employees
get a discount.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.056
You know, some deeper
than others.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.197
We're looking for a Layla
or a Carol.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.899
- You know them?
- Nope.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.901
But I do know a couple of girls

07:13.934 --> 07:16.637
who'd be happy to make you
forget all about them.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.011
What do you got?

07:24.044 --> 07:26.146
Since when's a VIP room
guys only?

07:27.915 --> 07:29.817
Definitely not my experience.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.988
(phones ringing)

07:35.022 --> 07:37.124
(racetrack announcers talking
over monitors)

07:38.792 --> 07:39.793
Hey! Hey!

07:39.827 --> 07:41.862
Back up! Back up! FBI!

07:41.895 --> 07:43.564
- Pencils down!
- Hands up!

07:43.597 --> 07:45.733
Hands up, okay.

07:45.766 --> 07:48.736
I'm sure you have all your work
backed up, gentlemen.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.671
Where'd all this come from?

07:55.208 --> 07:56.644
She's not talking,

07:56.677 --> 07:58.979
but one of her computer
schlubs told us plenty.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.781
He I.D.'d all three victims.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.182
Said they were serious gamblers.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.618
They used the erotic sites
to place their bets.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.119
Layla, Carol-- not hookers.

08:06.153 --> 08:09.790
These were teams--
L.A. Lakers, Carolina Panthers.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.959
Dollar amounts were
the money they laid down.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.661
All three dead guys
were in way deep.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.597
They owed our girl in there
six figures each.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.231
What does this have to do
with a serial killer?

08:20.167 --> 08:22.269
I don't know, seeing her
in those handcuffs, though,

08:22.302 --> 08:24.271
might not be a bad way to go.

08:24.304 --> 08:27.207
LAPD just found
another body. Same M.O.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.843
Jordan Harper, 37.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.945
But this time,
we got a witness.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.949
She was there?

08:35.983 --> 08:37.918
Not exactly.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.987
Mom just got back
from a business trip.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.656
She checked her nanny cam
recording,

08:42.690 --> 08:44.725
found that her Wi-Fi
frequency got crossed

08:44.758 --> 08:46.794
with a transmission coming
from the building

08:46.827 --> 08:49.763
across the street.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.132
MAN:
Place your bets.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.670
Last call.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.074
Betting is now closed.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.113
(gun cocks)

09:11.151 --> 09:14.087
(gun clicks)

09:14.121 --> 09:15.322
There are four men dead.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.790
Not suicide.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.995
Betting is now closed.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.932
It's the kind of game
you don't win,

09:24.965 --> 09:26.900
even if you survive.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.305
(gunshot)

09:39.847 --> 09:42.883
MAN:
Betting is now closed.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.118
LARRY:
Russian roulette.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.654
Legend goes that
the Russian officers,

09:46.687 --> 09:47.688
starving at the front,

09:47.721 --> 09:50.090
resorted to wagering
their lives

09:50.123 --> 09:51.191
for a crust of bread.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.225
NIKKI:
That's the Russian Army.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.661
What's up with these guys?

09:53.694 --> 09:55.128
Well, we can only
tell you what's up

09:55.162 --> 09:56.797
with the game,
'cause the site's protected.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.198
Only gamblers who

09:58.231 --> 10:00.901
are betting on the contests
have access.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.402
I was able to crack
the encryption.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.638
I mean, the whole thing's
a tournament.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.874
Right? You got eight players,
one winner.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.341
Hundreds of people
betting online.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.043
A marriage of greed
and bloodlust

10:10.077 --> 10:11.078
wedded to technology.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.413
This Web site has
all the bells and whistles.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.182
I mean, you can pull up
character bios

10:15.215 --> 10:16.850
and fan pages and blogs.

10:16.884 --> 10:19.987
You can even order a video
from previous contests.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.323
So, whoever's running these
games is streaming them online,

10:23.356 --> 10:25.425
taking the bets,
recalibrating the odds,

10:25.458 --> 10:26.359
all in seconds.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.161
Sickness aside, I mean,
what's the point?

10:28.195 --> 10:30.330
One man lives,
one man dies--

10:30.363 --> 10:31.665
why not just flip a coin?

10:31.699 --> 10:33.000
(gun clicks)

10:33.033 --> 10:34.835
Well, it's more complex
than that.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.337
With one bullet, one spin,

10:37.370 --> 10:40.140
the gun passed back and forth,
the game takes on nuance.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.242
I think to understand it,
you have to put yourself

10:42.275 --> 10:44.945
inside the game, become it.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.414
Just like a ball dropped
on a roulette wheel,

10:47.447 --> 10:50.450
the bullet is chambered
and spun.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.453
But unlike roulette, where
your eye can follow the ball,

10:53.486 --> 10:55.122
the bullet becomes invisible,

10:55.155 --> 10:56.990
its location a mystery.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.326
Early on, gamblers
like to play the long shot.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.762
And a one in six chance
that the gun will fire

11:01.795 --> 11:03.163
means six-to-one odds.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.133
That's a big payout
if you guess right.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.769
Longer you play,
the worse the odds get.

11:08.802 --> 11:12.239
One in six becomes one in five,
then one in four.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.108
And as chances increase
that the gun will go off,

11:15.142 --> 11:17.010
the bets become more even odds.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.879
The payouts get smaller,

11:18.912 --> 11:20.480
until finally,
(gun clicks)

11:20.513 --> 11:22.082
one player's luck runs out.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.350
(gunshot)

11:23.383 --> 11:24.785
Gamblers play the odds,

11:24.818 --> 11:27.220
but psychology is
also a factor here.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.889
CHARLIE: People believe
whatever they want, right?

11:28.922 --> 11:31.158
If a player has a hot hand,
he can't lose.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.192
Someone on a losing streak

11:32.225 --> 11:34.427
thinks their luck has got
to change, so logic,

11:34.461 --> 11:37.865
emotion, uh, greed--
they all play a part here.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.432
Well, so far,
we're only through round one.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.435
Four matches, four victors.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.137
Four losers.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.138
Round two is next.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.940
Two more guys are gonna die.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.441
I already hacked the site,

11:48.475 --> 11:50.110
so if we can do
a real-time trace

11:50.143 --> 11:51.044
the next time
they start streaming,

11:51.078 --> 11:53.380
then we can track it back
to its source,

11:53.413 --> 11:55.315
the, uh, the game itself.

11:57.150 --> 12:00.353
Okay. We I.D.'d the other guy
in the nanny cam video,

12:00.387 --> 12:02.255
the winner.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.057
Glen Olin.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.126
39. Accountant, huh?

12:06.159 --> 12:08.161
Wife reported him
missing about a week ago.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.296
Currently unemployed.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.332
Look, I mean, these guys
don't just wake up one morning

12:12.365 --> 12:13.533
and put a gun to their head.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.768
Somebody put them
in those chairs.

12:14.802 --> 12:17.237
DAVID: Maybe Olin's wife can
point us in the right direction.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.040
WOMAN: Glen had
a job interview last Monday.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.074
He left in the morning.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.409
He never came home.

12:22.442 --> 12:23.944
You know what
the interview was for?

12:23.977 --> 12:25.245
I don't know.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.947
He's had several.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.049
Glen was laid off last year.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.951
We've lost our health insurance.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.152
We may lose the house.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.053
It hasn't been easy.

12:35.555 --> 12:38.859
That picture was taken
in France on our honeymoon.

12:38.892 --> 12:42.495
We were supposed to stay
at this five-star hotel,

12:42.529 --> 12:44.331
but they lost our reservation.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.967
Glen went out
and bought camping gear.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.536
He said, "We can do
better than five stars.

12:49.569 --> 12:53.340
We can have a million
of them every night."

12:53.373 --> 12:54.507
Something's happened.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.043
I know it.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.510
That's why you're here.

12:57.544 --> 12:58.979
Miss Olin, are you aware

12:59.012 --> 13:01.248
of your husband having
a gambling problem?

13:01.281 --> 13:02.515
I saw the signs.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.986
The distraction,
the irritability,

13:06.019 --> 13:07.187
the late nights on the computer.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.890
Like before.

13:09.923 --> 13:13.126
He got help.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.494
He told me
he'd never do it again.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.364
He promised me.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.967
Okay, I'm going to need
to take that computer.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.368
Where is he?

13:21.401 --> 13:24.104
What's happened?

13:24.137 --> 13:26.874
Please, tell me the truth.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.115
(gun clicks)

13:37.217 --> 13:39.152
MAN (on video):
Place your bets.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.621
NIKKI: How many people you think
have watched this video?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.223
You heard from Charlie?

13:43.256 --> 13:45.158
Yeah, toiling away
on the trace program,

13:45.192 --> 13:46.259
hopefully nearing an answer.

13:46.293 --> 13:50.163
Well, too late for John Murray,
aka "The Dominator."

13:50.197 --> 13:53.166
LAPD found his body
an hour ago.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.067
MAN:
And final bets.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.041
(gun clicks)

14:01.074 --> 14:04.177
That is some kind of sick.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.612
He calls himself
"The Immortal."

14:05.645 --> 14:08.315
I've seen irrational
feelings of invincibility

14:08.348 --> 14:09.649
across a card table,

14:09.682 --> 14:11.451
but this is extreme.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.087
So, you really were a gambler?

14:14.121 --> 14:16.189
In a previous incarnation.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.490
What makes a man do this?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.960
The gambler's ruin.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.162
Doubling down, chasing losses.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.365
Thousand-dollar wager
fast becomes a six-figure debt,

14:25.398 --> 14:28.168
and you just start
to see no way out.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.038
MAN:
And final bets.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.472
Is that what happened to you?

14:32.505 --> 14:34.607
My situation
was a little more prosaic.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.409
You know, there's
a line in The Gambler...

14:36.443 --> 14:38.211
Yeah. "You gotta know
when to hold 'em..."

14:38.245 --> 14:39.947
* Know when to fold 'em.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.149
-Yeah.
-"The Gambler."

14:42.182 --> 14:44.451
- Kenny Rogers, right?
- I'm strictly a Torme

14:44.484 --> 14:47.287
and Tenors man, but, um,
I was talking about the movie.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.690
Yeah, there's a line where
Paul Sorvino asks James Caan,

14:50.723 --> 14:53.093
"What is it all gamblers
have in common?"

14:53.126 --> 14:55.963
And Caan says,
"They're all looking to lose."

14:55.996 --> 14:57.630
Well, that was me.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.300
I actually found power
in losing, you know.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.335
Freedom over the material.

15:02.369 --> 15:06.139
Less in my pockets meant
less on my mind.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.440
Betting is now closed.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.185
(gunshot)

15:19.552 --> 15:20.988
(door opens)

15:24.257 --> 15:25.959
Where are your friends?

15:25.993 --> 15:28.161
They're busy.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.296
Works for me.

15:29.329 --> 15:32.099
You know, there was a time
in my life

15:32.132 --> 15:34.234
when a ruthless woman
was a turn-on.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.103
You mean, like yesterday?

15:36.136 --> 15:38.972
Shows you how wrong I can be.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.241
Here I thought you were
a respectable businesswoman.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.276
Would have never taken you
for a bookie.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.278
I tend to all men's vices.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.714
Yeah, as long as they pay.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.217
We know about
the Russian roulette.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.419
I got nothing to do with that.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.255
We got four dead men,
each owing you six figures.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.124
That is gonna be
a really tough sell

15:57.157 --> 15:59.059
for any lawyer.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.994
I'm giving you a chance here.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.630
My friends won't.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.571
This guy comes into my place
looking for talent.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.507
Deadbeats,
my hardest-luck cases.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.410
He wanted a list.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.379
So you gave it to him?

16:19.412 --> 16:22.682
He was offering them a chance
to play their way out of debt.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.784
Each round they won,
they'd get 100 grand.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.754
The winner would take home
a million.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.422
So you sold their debt.

16:29.456 --> 16:30.690
Sold them.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.292
They're gamblers.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.726
They made a choice.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.762
All right.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.697
- I want a name.
- I don't have one.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.732
But...

16:41.634 --> 16:44.237
I can give you a face.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.443
Heard it might be
an all-nighter.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.611
Ugh! I hope not.

16:51.644 --> 16:52.779
What's this?

16:52.812 --> 16:54.247
I stopped by Scarpatto's.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.416
Picked up a some Bolognese,
a little salad.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.285
Didn't want you to miss dinner.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.420
Thanks. I appreciate
the thought.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.422
But, you know, you really
shouldn't be buying me take-out.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.691
You really shouldn't be buying
yourself take-out.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.526
Not given your finances.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.328
Oh, who died
and made you Suze Orman?

17:08.361 --> 17:09.829
Well, now is not the time,

17:09.862 --> 17:12.332
but we really do need
to talk about this, okay?

17:12.365 --> 17:13.600
- About what?
- About reality.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.136
I ran an analysis
of your portfolio.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.371
There is no way
that your finances are going

17:18.405 --> 17:20.373
to recover enough for you
to bankroll your retirement.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.442
Oh, I see. So, no more
take-out-- that's your solution.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.377
Well, you supported me
my whole life.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.313
It's time for me
to return the favor.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.481
Yeah, but it doesn't
work out that way.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.383
You see, a father is
supposed to support

17:30.417 --> 17:32.485
his children,
not the other way around.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.421
Oh, it goes bad
if it gets cold.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.391
*

17:38.425 --> 17:40.393
So, I thought
you were gonna show me a face.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.562
You don't like what you see?

17:42.595 --> 17:45.165
It's just that after, like,
the 30th butt crack,

17:45.198 --> 17:46.633
it starts to get a little old.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.736
So, is it normal to have
hidden cameras inside

17:49.769 --> 17:51.404
lap dance lounges?

17:51.438 --> 17:53.506
I like to look
out for my girls.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.508
And the occasional mark
with deep pockets

17:55.542 --> 17:57.244
who makes a drunken mistake.

17:57.277 --> 18:00.413
You got me pegged.

18:00.447 --> 18:04.517
You know,
while we're being honest,

18:04.551 --> 18:06.386
why do you like bad girls?

18:06.419 --> 18:09.456
Not enough attention from Mom,
Dad was a player?

18:09.489 --> 18:11.524
Or, um, maybe just the opposite?

18:11.558 --> 18:13.260
Nice family,

18:13.293 --> 18:16.329
church picnics, Boy Scouts,
Pledge of Allegiance.

18:16.363 --> 18:19.732
Then, maybe one day in
the Army, you get a taste.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.501
Relief from the war.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.470
Or boredom.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.505
You liked it.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.710
I guess now I got you pegged.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.514
I can see your face.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.784
There. That's him.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.258
DAVID:
Name's Kai Kragen.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.626
Reality TV show producer.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.828
Flamed out doing a show
called Thrill Drill.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.397
It's one of
those cheese-ball deals

18:50.430 --> 18:52.432
where people do bogus stunts
for cash.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.700
Except on Kragen's last show,

18:53.733 --> 18:55.502
things got a little
bit too real.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.537
Contestant was decapitated
doing a bungee jump.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.806
I saw that.
It was all over YouTube.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.575
Yeah, and that incident--
it just trashed his career,

19:02.609 --> 19:04.177
and then
lawsuits bankrupted him.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.678
So we got a reality
TV show producer

19:05.712 --> 19:07.314
who needs the money.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.249
All right, check it out.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.920
I love the picture.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.855
My favorite subject.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.657
COLBY:
Surprised it didn't go

19:17.690 --> 19:19.592
the way of the rest
of your stuff.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.628
Restitution to the family of the
guy whose head you lopped off.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.895
It survived, just like me.

19:22.929 --> 19:26.199
Well, we have our own
picture of you.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.301
Nice hidden camera, Hoover.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.437
You guys got me.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.305
I had a lap dance.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.640
Not the best path
to a meaningful

19:33.673 --> 19:35.775
relationship,
but it's also not a crime.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.544
We have other photos, too.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.779
I think you know them.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.649
Ooh.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.418
Looks like
they pissed somebody off.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.953
We have a witness
who says you recruited them

19:46.986 --> 19:49.489
for an online
Russian roulette tournament.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.790
We saw the show.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.625
It's right up there with
Thrill Drill for high impact.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.328
I'm out of the snuff business.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.763
You know, we saw
your old house on Mulholland.

19:56.796 --> 19:57.930
It was very nice.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.966
That must have been hard
to give up.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.868
Yeah, not to mention
all the money.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.336
That's TV.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.905
One day you're up,
and next day you're

20:05.938 --> 20:09.376
covered in blood,
holding someone's head.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.477
I'll be back.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.548
Maybe you already are.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.518
Look, I have
a respectable career

20:18.551 --> 20:20.653
producing infomercials now.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.889
All right?
One I need to get back to.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.324
(scoffs)

20:24.357 --> 20:25.392
(sniffing)

20:25.425 --> 20:28.395
I-I don't see why
you guys are wasting your time.

20:28.428 --> 20:31.030
Whether a guy puts a gun
to his head in a game

20:31.063 --> 20:33.666
or a bunch of people are eating
cow testicles on an island,

20:33.700 --> 20:36.603
it's all entertainment, right?

20:36.636 --> 20:40.540
Next time you want
to talk to me, call my lawyer.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.475
You guys know the way out?

20:45.645 --> 20:47.647
So, what do you think?
(cell phone ringing)

20:47.680 --> 20:50.850
Think we need to find out
how he's paying for that powder.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.852
Hey, Charlie, what's up?

20:52.885 --> 20:54.554
We're on our way.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.623
Next game just
started streaming.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.558
Place your bets.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.632
How we doing?

21:05.665 --> 21:07.600
Uh, the location's
somewhere downtown.

21:07.634 --> 21:08.835
It's-it's near Skid Row.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.570
I'm zeroing in on I.P. address.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.305
You guys got that?

21:12.339 --> 21:13.640
Got it. We're on our way.

21:13.673 --> 21:14.874
(siren wailing)

21:14.907 --> 21:16.609
DON: All right,
Nikki's on her way, too.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.578
MAN:
Last call. Final bets.

21:23.650 --> 21:26.619
MAN:
And betting is now closed.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.696
(gun clicks)

21:36.729 --> 21:38.498
Charlie?

21:38.531 --> 21:39.932
Almost. Almost. Um...

21:39.966 --> 21:41.934
Come on. Yeah, there it is.
I got it.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.870
Okay, it's the intersection
of First and Main Street.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.538
It's, like, a tenement building
on the corner.

21:45.572 --> 21:46.706
Okay, you guys got that?

21:46.739 --> 21:48.007
First and Main.
(siren wailing)

21:48.040 --> 21:50.677
We're two blocks away, Don.

21:55.748 --> 21:59.586
MAN:
Last call. All final bets.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.394
Betting is now closed.

22:07.427 --> 22:08.428
(tires screech)

22:09.762 --> 22:12.632
They got a satellite dish
on the third floor.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.922
(gunshot)

22:35.955 --> 22:38.057
(distant gunshot)

22:38.090 --> 22:40.493
FBI! Let's go!
Put your hands up!

22:40.527 --> 22:42.562
- FBI! Get up!
- Put them up!

22:42.595 --> 22:43.963
Behind your head, both of you.
Let's go.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.064
You, back there!

22:48.200 --> 22:49.536
Don't do it, man.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.141
Drop that gun.

23:16.463 --> 23:17.964
(panting)

23:17.997 --> 23:20.433
I lost him.

23:20.467 --> 23:21.634
Him, too.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.944
DAVID: Who is in charge
of the Russian roulette games?

23:34.647 --> 23:36.082
Is it Kragen?

23:38.184 --> 23:40.186
Six men are dead.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.589
Not to mention
Miami, Houston, Denver.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.023
Look, we have your computer.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.758
We know you've been
watching the games.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.461
You've been keeping close tabs
on the betting, on the odds.

23:48.495 --> 23:51.230
You were a fan
long before you were a player.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.632
I was never a fan.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.133
DON:
Right, you're an addict.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.669
You bet on people who are
gonna blow their brains out.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.204
The only thing I ever bet on

23:58.237 --> 24:01.040
was a house, a job, security.

24:01.073 --> 24:04.544
I'm making a far safer bet now.

24:04.577 --> 24:05.978
Yeah, with a gun to your head?

24:06.012 --> 24:07.847
We're consenting adults.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.816
Well, why don't you
tell your wife that.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.552
I know you think you may
have let her down.

24:12.585 --> 24:13.653
Okay?

24:13.686 --> 24:15.688
What you're doing right now
is not going to help.

24:15.722 --> 24:18.691
What you need to do is
think about your wife.

24:18.725 --> 24:19.859
You need to talk to her.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.027
I think about her every moment.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.195
She's the reason
I'm doing all this.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.898
The last thing I want to do
is talk to her.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.504
Like I said,

24:31.538 --> 24:33.506
I'm a consenting adult.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.274
I-I haven't committed any crime.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.976
Hmm?

24:37.009 --> 24:38.911
You got nothing to hold me on.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.949
If we put you on the street,

24:42.982 --> 24:44.984
you're going right
back to that game.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.986
It's down to the final two--

24:47.019 --> 24:48.988
my shot at a million bucks.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.222
What do you think?

24:50.256 --> 24:51.123
How can a man

24:51.157 --> 24:54.794
so completely lose
touch with reality?

24:54.827 --> 24:58.264
You know,
I'm not so sure he has.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.299
Mm, what? More meditation
on the gambler's ruin?

25:00.332 --> 25:01.534
I've seen players give in

25:01.568 --> 25:03.035
to the dark side,
their addiction,

25:03.069 --> 25:04.871
where all they believe in
is the game.

25:04.904 --> 25:08.074
His eyes are filled with
a different kind of certainty.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.309
Those numbers you found
on Olin's computers--

25:10.342 --> 25:13.546
calculations on the odds,
and the betting...

25:13.580 --> 25:15.281
I'd like to see those.

25:18.618 --> 25:21.087
The guys we grabbed at
the game lawyered up.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.254
I mean, somebody got to them.

25:22.288 --> 25:23.956
DON:
Then you guys should tail Olin.

25:23.990 --> 25:24.957
Okay.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.759
Agent Eppes!

25:26.793 --> 25:28.628
I hear you found Glen.

25:28.661 --> 25:29.962
Where is he? Can I see him?

25:29.996 --> 25:31.598
We don't really have
enough to hold him.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.633
We're going to have
to let him go.

25:33.666 --> 25:34.701
No, no, no.

25:34.734 --> 25:35.201
You let him back out there,
he'll kill himself.

25:35.234 --> 25:36.936
You can't do this!

25:36.969 --> 25:39.572
Glen! Glen!

25:41.107 --> 25:43.643
Glen! Wait!

25:43.676 --> 25:45.244
(crying):
Glen...

25:45.277 --> 25:46.846
(sobbing)

25:56.122 --> 25:58.024
Glad to see you're not alone.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.325
(chuckles)

25:59.358 --> 26:00.860
Got another friend?

26:00.893 --> 26:01.961
Sure.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.630
(clears throat)

26:04.731 --> 26:06.365
You want to talk about it?

26:06.398 --> 26:08.601
Ah, all is good.

26:08.635 --> 26:09.969
It's this case, right?

26:10.002 --> 26:11.638
Men killing themselves
for money.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.640
Yeah, I mean, this guy...

26:13.673 --> 26:16.175
he's got this woman--
I mean, she loves him.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.644
And-and he's got a home and...

26:17.677 --> 26:19.812
Yeah, well,
you can't help people

26:19.846 --> 26:21.280
if they don't want to be helped.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.715
Hey, Charlie talk to you?

26:22.749 --> 26:24.684
Yeah, he tried.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.854
Boy, we are so similar.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.056
We just don't want help
from anybody, right?

26:30.089 --> 26:32.124
I must've got it from you.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.961
But I learned.

26:42.368 --> 26:45.171
Who's he talking to?

26:45.204 --> 26:46.338
Guy's given up on life.

26:46.372 --> 26:47.406
I'm glad to see
he still has time

26:47.439 --> 26:48.641
for his friends.

26:48.675 --> 26:49.676
Yeah, speaking of which,

26:49.709 --> 26:52.411
you give any thought
to our last conversation?

26:52.444 --> 26:53.412
About me signing up
for Twitter?

26:53.445 --> 26:54.647
- Yeah.
- Hell yeah.

26:54.681 --> 26:56.348
And the answer
is still hell no.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.718
I'm-I'm just saying, man,
if I'm out at a bar,

26:58.751 --> 27:00.152
having a few beers,
having a good time,

27:00.186 --> 27:01.353
I tweet, you read it,

27:01.387 --> 27:02.488
then you come on
over and join me.

27:02.521 --> 27:04.791
Dude, if you want to have
a drink, you just call me.

27:04.824 --> 27:06.826
You "tweeting" me-- ugh.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.260
I don't even like
the way that sounds.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.195
All right, whatever.

27:09.228 --> 27:10.997
Just keep on living
in the 20th century.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.299
Hold on.
Where's he going?

27:13.332 --> 27:16.769
I don't know, but his car's
parked the other direction.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.738
(engine starts)

27:18.771 --> 27:20.206
(tires screeching)

27:28.480 --> 27:29.949
(tires screeching)

27:42.361 --> 27:44.997
Well, we know
who he was calling.

27:45.031 --> 27:47.033
Guys really want him
back in the game.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.868
You know, if you
were on Twitter,

27:48.901 --> 27:51.738
you wouldn't have to tell Don
about this in person.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.672
And... pull!

27:55.474 --> 27:57.710
LARRY: I appreciate
the enthusiasm, Charles,

27:57.744 --> 27:59.078
but I don't think
the word "pull"

27:59.111 --> 28:00.412
is the appropriate
term of art here.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.214
You're worried about
appropriate,

28:02.248 --> 28:04.216
I'm hoping one of these kids
doesn't snap an iPhone picture

28:04.250 --> 28:05.785
for the folks back home.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.419
Then we'll both be
on sabbatical.

28:07.453 --> 28:10.122
(computer chirping)
Well, the tracking program

28:10.156 --> 28:11.758
is still searching.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.760
So I think we're going
to have to wait

28:13.793 --> 28:15.795
for the next game
to start streaming.

28:15.828 --> 28:16.796
Let's load the gun.

28:16.829 --> 28:19.198
CHARLIE: Now, what exactly are
we looking for?

28:19.231 --> 28:22.234
An edge, Charlie--
just some justification

28:22.268 --> 28:24.070
for Glen Olin's certitude.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.337
- Right. Right.
- And spin.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.538
We will go again.

28:26.572 --> 28:29.909
I don't mean to keep bugging you
about you leaving and all.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.477
- That's a relief.
- Well, the longer

28:31.510 --> 28:35.147
you stay, the more I'm wondering
how committed you are to

28:35.181 --> 28:36.382
leaving.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.750
Y-You're not having as much fun

28:37.784 --> 28:39.451
as I am right now? Fire!

28:39.485 --> 28:40.252
(gun clicks)
Exactly.

28:40.286 --> 28:42.922
But as intriguing
as all this is,

28:42.955 --> 28:44.423
it's also distracting.

28:44.456 --> 28:47.459
The school, the FBI-- I just...

28:47.493 --> 28:51.497
I want to return to just
some place of pure thought.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.833
Okay, go to the arcade.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.902
You know, play your Tempest,
clear your head.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.237
I'm just no match
for the clutter.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.006
You know,
it's-it's like your game.

29:00.039 --> 29:02.508
I mean, there's always
one more enemy to be zapped.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.543
Fire.
(gun clicks)

29:04.576 --> 29:05.812
I appreciate your concern,

29:05.845 --> 29:08.347
but my dawdling has nothing to
do with some change of heart.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.817
Then what?

29:10.850 --> 29:13.752
My paving stones
are not yet aligned.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.559
Fire.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.295
All right, we've got a winner.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.431
We do, indeed.

29:25.464 --> 29:26.465
What?

29:26.498 --> 29:28.968
We just found Olin's edge.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.502
DON:
So, you're saying it's fixed?

29:30.536 --> 29:33.973
According to these figures, yes.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.407
Okay, so,
on the left are numbers

29:35.441 --> 29:36.843
we got off of
Glen Olin's computer.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.344
These are odds
and betting patterns

29:38.377 --> 29:40.046
for the previous
three tournaments.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.247
Numbers on the right are ours.

29:41.280 --> 29:45.417
Now, we generated these by
running Russian roulette games

29:45.451 --> 29:46.552
with student volunteers.

29:46.585 --> 29:47.954
We didn't kill anyone.

29:47.987 --> 29:49.421
These figures show

29:49.455 --> 29:52.992
that in almost every case,
the house came away the winner.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.061
Making sure that
the right person

29:55.094 --> 29:56.595
lost at the right time,

29:56.628 --> 29:58.064
maximizing their returns.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.565
How do you fix Russian roulette?

29:59.598 --> 30:01.100
Same as in casino roulette.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.935
By fixing the wheel.

30:02.969 --> 30:04.436
See, remember our revolver.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.238
The bullet is
chambered and spun.

30:06.272 --> 30:07.273
The spin is random.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.041
And the bullet disappears.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.910
Where she stops, nobody knows.

30:10.943 --> 30:12.344
- Unless they do.
- You control the wheel,

30:12.378 --> 30:14.246
you control the game.
It's a sure thing.

30:14.280 --> 30:17.016
Techs examined the guns
from the crime scenes.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.118
Each has a radio receiver
inside it.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.420
And triggered by remote,

30:21.453 --> 30:23.455
the device activates a photo-eye

30:23.489 --> 30:25.257
on the cylinder-stop
inside the gun.

30:25.291 --> 30:26.358
Yeah, there's no way

30:26.392 --> 30:27.860
that they would've found it

30:27.894 --> 30:29.595
if they weren't looking for it.

30:32.331 --> 30:33.365
Oh, hey, Char...

30:33.399 --> 30:34.934
Oh, this-- it's okay.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.168
It's a dummy.
(chuckles)

30:36.202 --> 30:38.437
Placing a bullet
in a marked chamber,

30:38.470 --> 30:40.572
all the user has to do

30:40.606 --> 30:42.108
is push a button
on a remote control;

30:42.141 --> 30:43.342
that stops the cylinder.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.144
It stops the bullet,
wherever they want,

30:45.177 --> 30:47.179
every spin, every time.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.982
Glen Olin knew these contests
were rigged, and that

30:50.016 --> 30:51.150
explains his confidence.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.885
Yeah, he's in on it.

30:52.919 --> 30:54.020
Well, his cell phone records
say different.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.487
He called his bookie last night.

30:55.521 --> 30:58.090
He placed every dollar he's
ever won so far in the game.

30:58.124 --> 30:59.591
What, on himself?

30:59.625 --> 31:00.927
His opponent.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.929
"The Immortal" must be in
on the fix.

31:02.962 --> 31:03.930
Well, he was willing to risk

31:03.963 --> 31:06.632
his life the first time
on a chance at $100,000.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.901
Now he can bet on a sure thing
worth, uh,

31:08.935 --> 31:10.069
five or six times that amount.

31:10.102 --> 31:12.004
I know some guys
are willing to do anything

31:12.038 --> 31:13.605
to make sure their
family is taken care of,

31:13.639 --> 31:15.574
but Olin has decided

31:15.607 --> 31:18.210
his life is worth the price.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.313
Hey, Don, we got Kragen.

31:21.347 --> 31:22.982
Interpol had him on a list.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.583
He's been laundering money
offshore

31:24.616 --> 31:25.684
through his infomercial company.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.086
Check this out, it gets better.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.687
There was a chip
on one of the cameras

31:28.720 --> 31:29.956
we recovered at the game,

31:29.989 --> 31:31.523
hadn't been fully
recorded over.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.692
There were takes
from an infomercial of his

31:33.725 --> 31:35.061
on Shinto knives.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.228
All right, good.
Pick him up.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.675
Got a body.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.648
The remote control transmitters.

31:56.682 --> 31:59.018
Somebody helped themselves
to a pair.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.053
Yeah, that's not all they took.

32:01.087 --> 32:02.221
23 files have been downloaded.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.992
(gunfire)

32:09.728 --> 32:11.998
Liked that guy a lot better

32:12.031 --> 32:14.333
when he was pointing
the gun at his own head.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.607
The Immortal has a name.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.375
AFIS didn't come back
with anything

32:23.409 --> 32:25.744
on his prints,
so I cast a wider net.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.579
Got a response from up north.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.714
Mm. Brian Walters.

32:28.747 --> 32:31.117
DUI, Vancouver, '07.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.418
Guy's a Canuck.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.586
And a bona fide TV professional.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.322
Now, among his other crimes,

32:36.355 --> 32:38.090
add outsourcing.
Guy's worked

32:38.124 --> 32:40.392
on a bunch of American shows
shot up in Canada,

32:40.426 --> 32:42.161
including Thrill Drill.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.229
That's how he met Kragen.

32:43.262 --> 32:44.363
Walters did special effects

32:44.396 --> 32:46.698
for Kragen-- explosions, smoke,

32:46.732 --> 32:48.200
- pyrotechnics.
- Well, now we know

32:48.234 --> 32:49.435
who rigged the guns.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.536
So, they were in it together?

32:50.569 --> 32:51.703
From the start.

32:51.737 --> 32:52.571
Now, I'm guessing that

32:52.604 --> 32:54.440
Kragen promised Walters
a big payday--

32:54.473 --> 32:55.674
the million-dollar prize
in the game.

32:55.707 --> 32:58.277
Uh, maybe he wanted more money,
like a share in the profits.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.446
Mm-hmm. And when Kragen balked,

33:00.479 --> 33:01.780
Walters decided
to cut his partner out.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.615
Now, we recovered the files

33:03.649 --> 33:06.452
that Walters downloaded
from Kragen's computer.

33:06.485 --> 33:09.055
Gamblers' user names,

33:09.088 --> 33:10.489
dollar amounts,
players they bet on.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.058
So, Walters has taken over
the game.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.525
NIKKI: Yeah, and running it
his way now.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.794
Walters sent an e-mail
from Kragen's computer

33:15.827 --> 33:17.496
to the eight highest rollers,

33:17.529 --> 33:19.031
inviting them
to the final match.

33:19.065 --> 33:20.666
Except it's not gonna be online.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.601
It's gonna be in person.

33:22.634 --> 33:25.104
He's flying them in,
staging a human cockfight.

33:25.137 --> 33:27.606
And Olin's gonna lose.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.541
Walters' e-mail included
a Web address with a link

33:29.575 --> 33:30.776
to a protected site.

33:30.809 --> 33:31.643
That could be
the instructions on

33:31.677 --> 33:33.445
when and where the game
is going down.

33:33.479 --> 33:34.713
Charlie was able to crack

33:34.746 --> 33:35.781
the Russian roulette
tournament's Web site.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.816
Maybe he can do the same,
help us find this game.

33:37.849 --> 33:38.750
All right,
get that address to him.

33:41.087 --> 33:43.089
Hey, how's the hack going?

33:43.122 --> 33:44.190
It's going slowly.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.791
I don't even have a location.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.459
(computer chirps)
And it's not helping

33:47.493 --> 33:49.095
my concentration that Amita

33:49.128 --> 33:51.430
keeps e-mailing me nonstop
from her conference.

33:51.463 --> 33:52.431
She bored?

33:52.464 --> 33:53.499
She's anxious.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.701
She keeps sending me
sample wedding invitations.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.736
Like, we haven't
even set a date yet.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.538
You're coming to
the wedding, right?

33:59.571 --> 34:01.740
I would like to.

34:01.773 --> 34:04.243
You would like to?

34:04.276 --> 34:07.146
(sighs)

34:07.179 --> 34:08.514
Well, Charlie, it's complicated.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.616
I don't even know
where I'm gonna be.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.284
What's complicated?

34:12.318 --> 34:14.186
It's my wedding day, Larry.

34:14.220 --> 34:17.323
All right, I don't, I don't care
if you're in Machu Picchu,

34:17.356 --> 34:20.459
Katmandu or-or the Corn Palace.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.128
I do expect you
to hop on a plane

34:22.161 --> 34:23.295
and be at my wedding, okay?

34:23.329 --> 34:24.463
Yeah.

34:24.496 --> 34:25.764
What is going on with you?

34:25.797 --> 34:27.633
I don't know.
I just lack clarity.

34:27.666 --> 34:30.102
In the past, one door closes,
another door opens.

34:30.136 --> 34:32.704
And now it's like
I'm caught in some...

34:32.738 --> 34:34.406
vestibule of indecision.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.308
(computer chirps)

34:37.843 --> 34:39.811
Another invitation?

34:39.845 --> 34:41.813
Yeah.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.715
To the game.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.286
You know the rules, gentlemen.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.688
Betting starts at $1 million.

34:49.721 --> 34:52.191
The players drew lots
to determine the order.

34:54.193 --> 34:56.462
Player number two...

34:58.630 --> 34:59.765
will begin.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.500
Place your bets.

35:01.533 --> 35:04.203
Last call.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.671
(murmuring)

35:09.908 --> 35:12.678
Final bets.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.782
Taking all final bets.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.253
(gun cocks)

35:21.287 --> 35:22.821
(beeping)

35:22.854 --> 35:24.190
The betting is now closed.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.392
DAVID:
Hey! FBI!

35:26.425 --> 35:28.227
I want to see hands!

35:28.260 --> 35:29.828
(guns cocking)

35:33.665 --> 35:35.534
Something we said?

35:36.902 --> 35:40.339
Everybody, uh, just...
just be cool, okay?

35:47.646 --> 35:49.748
We didn't come here
looking for a fight.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.850
There's no army behind us.

35:51.883 --> 35:54.753
We just want to take
this guy out of here

35:54.786 --> 35:56.755
in one piece.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.857
All right, so,

35:58.890 --> 36:01.960
let's just put our guns away.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.595
Okay?

36:03.629 --> 36:05.297
We all go home.

36:05.331 --> 36:06.798
Nobody loses.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.805
You got another idea?

36:19.711 --> 36:21.247
Okay.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.222
Okay, you, I want in.

36:30.256 --> 36:33.959
But I want The Immortal
here to go first.

36:33.992 --> 36:35.427
I'm putting
my money behind him.

36:35.461 --> 36:37.195
That's not the assigned order.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.267
What's the problem?

36:41.300 --> 36:42.268
You get nervous?

36:51.543 --> 36:53.412
You pick up the gun.

36:55.314 --> 36:59.285
Now, I got a pretty good feeling
about that first trigger pull.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.952
Second one, not so much,
but the one

37:00.986 --> 37:02.621
after that, I got a
very bad feeling about,

37:02.654 --> 37:03.789
and I'll bet you have

37:03.822 --> 37:04.990
the exact same feeling as I do.

37:05.023 --> 37:06.492
Why are you guys doing this?

37:06.525 --> 37:07.493
I'm saving your life.

37:07.526 --> 37:08.627
You are coming with us.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.529
I don't want to be saved.

37:14.766 --> 37:17.369
So, what are you waiting for?

37:17.403 --> 37:18.670
Pick up the gun.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.240
Go ahead.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.050
(crowd murmuring)

37:32.083 --> 37:34.386
That's what I thought.

37:36.021 --> 37:38.990
We-we are going to take him
out of that door.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.992
We all know
if the shooting starts,

37:41.026 --> 37:42.961
nobody wins.

37:49.034 --> 37:51.002
(guns uncocking)

37:58.977 --> 38:01.680
He's not smiling now.

38:01.713 --> 38:02.914
MARGO:
Agent Granger.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.316
Hey.

38:04.350 --> 38:05.517
Thought that was you.

38:05.551 --> 38:08.754
Ah, you just couldn't, uh,
stay away from the place, huh?

38:08.787 --> 38:10.689
I was here giving a statement.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.092
It's good to see you.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.894
Yeah, you, too.

38:15.927 --> 38:19.331
You know, I know we got off
to a bad start, but I was

38:19.365 --> 38:21.800
thinking that perhaps we could
do something about that.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.335
Dinner, maybe?

38:23.369 --> 38:25.337
Yeah. Maybe.

38:25.371 --> 38:26.938
You know where to find me.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.106
Mm-hmm.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.741
*

38:29.775 --> 38:32.077
Make sure there's
no hidden camera.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.880
Yeah, be careful
with that one, buddy.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.715
Okay. And this
coming from the guy

38:36.748 --> 38:38.417
who looks for love
at the morgue.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.619
Oh, no. Claudia hasn't
worked there in a year.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.088
Oh. Who said anything
about Claudia?

38:43.121 --> 38:47.025
* Pistol was never loaded

38:47.058 --> 38:48.093
Another bad bet.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.495
I lost everything again.

38:49.528 --> 38:52.097
Well, you got something
much better, pal.

38:52.130 --> 38:53.399
Oh, you mean my life?

38:53.432 --> 38:54.966
It's not worth much.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.635
That's everything.

38:58.470 --> 39:01.607
* So let me catch my breath

39:01.640 --> 39:03.375
I don't know
what to say to her.

39:03.409 --> 39:05.411
Yeah, you do.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.913
* Before you start crying

39:07.946 --> 39:12.050
* Turn off the television
and end yours *

39:15.487 --> 39:17.689
* Hey, Liza

39:17.723 --> 39:21.593
* I love you to the bones

39:21.627 --> 39:26.164
* But I can't stick
around here anymore *

39:26.197 --> 39:27.566
Oh, yeah.

39:27.599 --> 39:28.800
I remember that day.

39:28.834 --> 39:31.069
That was, uh, Princeton.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.938
- You just passed your orals.
- That's right.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.607
Larry walked me through them.

39:35.641 --> 39:37.409
Good game?

39:37.443 --> 39:39.578
Now, before you lecture me,
Professor...

39:39.611 --> 39:40.946
Am I lecturing you?

39:40.979 --> 39:43.815
I just want to assure you
that I wasn't fiddling

39:43.849 --> 39:46.452
on a golf course
while my portfolio was burning.

39:46.485 --> 39:47.453
Okay. Dad, I didn't
say anything.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.655
Good, 'cause I want you
to listen for a second.

39:49.688 --> 39:52.791
I decided to take you up
on your offer of help.

39:52.824 --> 39:54.893
Great. 'Cause I was gonna say...

39:54.926 --> 39:56.595
I'm sorry.
I'm listening.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.464
I don't want you
to give me any money,

39:58.497 --> 39:59.765
because I'm-I'm going
to go back to work.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.500
But, uh,

40:01.533 --> 40:03.569
checking the job listings,
I, uh... I found out

40:03.602 --> 40:06.137
that, uh, my computer design
skills are not quite up to date.

40:06.171 --> 40:07.739
So I need a refresher course,

40:07.773 --> 40:09.808
and I thought maybe
you might give me one.

40:09.841 --> 40:10.942
(chuckles)

40:10.976 --> 40:13.011
You want me to teach you...?

40:13.044 --> 40:15.213
Come on, you know
how that goes, Dad.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.915
No, I'll pay you for it.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.550
Of course you'll have
to give me the money.

40:18.584 --> 40:19.985
(laughs)
Where is Larry?

40:20.018 --> 40:21.620
He blew off
our chess game again.

40:21.653 --> 40:22.821
Oh, he's, uh...

40:22.854 --> 40:25.791
He's dealing
with some stuff right now.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.959
Yeah. Isn't that always
the case?

40:30.962 --> 40:32.764
(video game sound effects)

40:32.798 --> 40:38.003
* I can't stick
around here anymore *

40:41.206 --> 40:43.609
* Any minute now

40:43.642 --> 40:47.546
* They'll come
crashing down our door *

40:47.579 --> 40:50.916
* So grab what you need

40:50.949 --> 40:53.485
* We got to go

40:53.519 --> 40:55.220
* Oh, no, no, no, no

40:55.253 --> 40:56.955
* No, no.
