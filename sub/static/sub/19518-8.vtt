00:00.297 --> 00:01.851
I have a brother.

00:01.882 --> 00:03.698
It's like your dad cloned himself.

00:03.733 --> 00:05.812
He's been in and out of prison,

00:05.837 --> 00:08.370
basically, for years
until a few months ago.

00:09.839 --> 00:11.940
It wasn't you that was
supposed to be here.

00:11.975 --> 00:13.367
How does it feel?

00:13.392 --> 00:15.328
How does it feel not to be in control?

00:15.353 --> 00:19.623
I've been in love
with Briana, my sister,

00:19.648 --> 00:21.398
for as long as I can remember.

00:21.423 --> 00:22.422
Brady!

00:22.447 --> 00:24.681
I'm not you, okay? I'm not.

00:24.706 --> 00:26.439
I'm not sick like you.

00:26.464 --> 00:28.398
You mean, sick like me, is that it?

00:28.423 --> 00:30.123
You brought this on yourself!

01:50.020 --> 01:52.287
You gotta call 911.

02:11.874 --> 02:13.326
It's over.

02:15.077 --> 02:17.388
We know who killed Jesse.

02:19.881 --> 02:22.007
You can talk to me now.

02:23.674 --> 02:26.074
You don't understand me.

02:27.923 --> 02:30.290
I tried a different way with you.

02:30.968 --> 02:32.125
To what?

02:32.160 --> 02:33.992
To end the cycle.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.527
This is car 16.

02:35.562 --> 02:38.373
We're closing in on
Brady's phone GPS location.

02:55.514 --> 02:57.982
- APB.
- White male,

02:58.017 --> 03:00.617
six feet, brown hair. Left on foot.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.401
My brother killed Brady.

03:14.266 --> 03:16.166
He also saved my life.

03:21.106 --> 03:23.073
When you called form Brady's
I sent cars over there,

03:23.108 --> 03:24.941
but I guess...

03:24.976 --> 03:27.501
Adam got to you first.

03:33.582 --> 03:36.285
Another riddle. It was at a shelter.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.253
I went to find him.

03:39.590 --> 03:41.215
I did.

03:41.246 --> 03:42.690
Why did you?

03:42.725 --> 03:45.393
'Cause I was gonna fucking kill him.

03:45.418 --> 03:46.894
I was gonna drag him into the woods

03:46.929 --> 03:48.562
and put a bullet in his head.

03:48.598 --> 03:51.277
- Peter.
- What?

03:51.734 --> 03:53.634
How else does this end?

03:53.669 --> 03:56.170
You need to go home.

03:56.206 --> 03:59.855
I need to find him and...

03:59.975 --> 04:02.376
you need to go home. You
can't do this with me.

04:02.411 --> 04:04.511
I'm wrapped up in this, Annie.

04:04.918 --> 04:10.347
I've got my fucking
hands in all this shit.

04:12.654 --> 04:15.956
I gotta clean this mess up, okay?

04:16.357 --> 04:19.358
What happened when you saw him?

04:20.762 --> 04:22.596
He got a jump on me.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.089
Annie.

04:29.534 --> 04:31.352
Is Daisy okay?

04:34.641 --> 04:36.110
She's okay.

04:37.044 --> 04:40.078
I didn't tell you everything.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.048
My brother's been back for a while.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.451
He was the one that sent
me riddles when I was young,

04:46.486 --> 04:48.553
- and...
- Let's go.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.059
Did you hear what I just said?

04:50.084 --> 04:53.657
It doesn't matter who or why,

04:54.122 --> 04:56.993
it all ends the same.
We lose you to this.

04:57.029 --> 05:01.153
Now think of Daisy and stop, now.

05:02.168 --> 05:04.046
Walk away.

05:04.370 --> 05:05.968
With me.

05:06.683 --> 05:08.420
Right now.

05:16.214 --> 05:18.214
I'm going today.

05:45.890 --> 05:48.725
- Did he suffer?
- No.

05:52.281 --> 05:55.382
He told me what happened...

05:56.215 --> 05:58.882
the night he killed Jesse.

06:01.923 --> 06:04.421
When we were kids,

06:05.233 --> 06:07.227
our dad...

06:09.063 --> 06:11.864
when he was drinking,
he was the worst with me.

06:11.899 --> 06:13.233
That was until Brady figured out

06:13.268 --> 06:15.867
that if he just provoked him enough,

06:15.902 --> 06:18.003
when he was raging,

06:18.038 --> 06:20.772
he could get Dad to
give him the worst of it.

06:22.743 --> 06:24.811
Whatever else he was,

06:25.608 --> 06:27.379
he was my brother.

06:27.414 --> 06:29.548
I really am sorry.

06:32.418 --> 06:33.584
Yeah.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.719
Where's your daughter, Tom?

06:35.755 --> 06:37.555
Where's Hannah?

06:37.590 --> 06:39.290
Who is this?

06:39.325 --> 06:41.010
Where's Hannah?

06:41.827 --> 06:44.619
- She's at school...
- Is she?

06:45.465 --> 06:47.898
Or is she in the woods where I left her?

06:48.190 --> 06:49.807
Daddy!

06:49.832 --> 06:51.549
Hannah!

06:53.705 --> 06:56.173
Daddy, help!

06:59.518 --> 07:01.244
Hannah?!

07:01.280 --> 07:03.088
Daddy!

07:15.259 --> 07:17.961
Chief, we just got a call
from a jogger in the woods.

07:17.986 --> 07:20.548
He heard a man's voice
screaming for help.

07:22.032 --> 07:24.517
Over there.

07:34.143 --> 07:35.843
Oh shit!

07:36.053 --> 07:38.045
- Is he alive?
- Daddy, help!

07:38.937 --> 07:40.421
Daddy!

07:40.446 --> 07:42.037
I'm on it.

07:42.381 --> 07:44.047
I've gotta pulse.

07:44.136 --> 07:46.370
Daddy, help!

07:46.395 --> 07:49.139
Please!! Daddy!

07:51.293 --> 07:53.459
Daddy!

07:55.264 --> 07:57.197
Help!

07:58.499 --> 08:00.373
Daddy, help!

08:02.640 --> 08:06.451
Daddy! Help!

08:06.541 --> 08:09.819
Daddy! Help!

08:09.844 --> 08:11.744
It's a recording.

08:17.291 --> 08:19.196
What the hell?

08:30.948 --> 08:32.914
Are you serious?

08:32.951 --> 08:35.051
I've been working a
murder totally blind?

08:35.087 --> 08:36.292
Adam has nothing to do with Jesse.

08:36.317 --> 08:39.054
All right. Tom's daughter,
Hannah, is in school.

08:39.090 --> 08:40.712
So is her younger sister.

08:40.738 --> 08:43.225
Neither were approached
by any strangers.

08:43.260 --> 08:45.393
So this was all just a hoax
to get Tom into the woods?

08:45.429 --> 08:47.690
I mean, what, what the hell's
he doing? What does he want?

08:47.715 --> 08:49.098
He wants me to break the cycle.

08:49.133 --> 08:51.862
- That's what he said at the crash site.
- What cycle?

08:52.510 --> 08:54.229
Sandy and Jesse.

08:54.254 --> 08:56.370
It's always Sandy and Jesse.

08:56.987 --> 08:58.706
Adam gave me a picture
of Tom in the pageant

08:58.742 --> 09:00.682
from the night that Sandy was killed.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.810
Tom had something to do with Sandy?

09:02.846 --> 09:04.659
I think we need to find out.

09:04.684 --> 09:06.884
Are we seriously working a
20-year-old murder right now?

09:06.909 --> 09:08.676
Yes.

09:13.555 --> 09:15.555
How come I'm not going to school?

09:16.892 --> 09:19.263
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

09:19.862 --> 09:21.728
Remember that town we
went to the other day?

09:21.764 --> 09:23.463
The place with the chicken?

09:23.498 --> 09:25.919
Yeah, but there's more
stuff than that, Dais.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.101
They're building condos there...

09:29.356 --> 09:31.153
and that's work for me.

09:31.178 --> 09:33.130
You're moving there?

09:34.051 --> 09:35.908
Yeah.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.709
With you.

09:37.745 --> 09:40.745
- What about Mom?
- I can't make her come.

09:40.770 --> 09:42.748
You can't make me go then.

09:42.784 --> 09:44.082
Actually, I can.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.786
Not if Mom doesn't let you.

09:45.811 --> 09:48.419
Right now? The way things are? I can.

09:48.454 --> 09:50.083
You do drugs.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.922
No, I don't.

09:54.272 --> 09:55.771
I did.

09:57.102 --> 09:59.305
And I'm working on that,

09:59.330 --> 10:01.198
and it's why we gotta get outta here.

10:01.233 --> 10:02.703
We have to move 'cause you do drugs?

10:02.728 --> 10:03.735
No. We gotta move

10:03.760 --> 10:05.907
because I can't be a
good dad here, Daisy.

10:05.932 --> 10:08.772
There's no work. And
I'm getting in fights.

10:08.808 --> 10:11.508
And, and, you're hanging
out where a kid got killed!

10:12.511 --> 10:14.477
You can't get obsessed with death!

10:14.513 --> 10:16.890
And your mom? Things are not good!

10:16.915 --> 10:18.446
And I know you're gonna be pissed at me

10:18.482 --> 10:20.296
and I don't care!

10:21.427 --> 10:23.928
That's a lie. It guts me.

10:25.723 --> 10:27.156
But I'll take it.

10:27.192 --> 10:28.858
Dais.

10:28.893 --> 10:30.626
Daisy!

10:31.747 --> 10:33.681
It's time, Maggie.

10:33.706 --> 10:36.231
Driver was always passing out in places

10:36.266 --> 10:39.426
and Tom thought if he showed
Sandy something of her dad's,

10:39.451 --> 10:41.952
she'd follow Tom into the woods.

10:42.606 --> 10:45.332
He got me to steal driver's watch.

10:45.403 --> 10:46.936
He lured her into the woods with it?

10:46.971 --> 10:48.504
That's all I know.

10:48.539 --> 10:50.673
I don't know what
happened in that shack.

10:50.709 --> 10:52.273
The shack in the woods?

10:52.309 --> 10:55.700
There used to be a path in
the woods from the old church.

10:55.725 --> 10:57.545
Did Tom lock Sandy in there?

10:57.581 --> 11:00.215
All I know is about the watch

11:00.250 --> 11:02.450
and that something happened in there.

11:02.485 --> 11:04.432
How do you know that
something happened in there?

11:04.457 --> 11:06.690
Because I had to cut myself in there.

11:06.715 --> 11:08.190
A blood pact.

11:08.225 --> 11:10.825
So we wouldn't turn on each other.

11:10.860 --> 11:12.292
They made me.

11:12.328 --> 11:13.715
They?

11:14.396 --> 11:16.512
Who? Tom and who?

11:17.866 --> 11:20.176
Jameson and Mother.

11:21.971 --> 11:24.746
Get cars to Jameson and the Mayor's.

11:25.507 --> 11:27.823
Lily had an alibi on the
night of Sandy's murder.

11:27.848 --> 11:28.942
They all had alibis,

11:28.977 --> 11:31.010
but something fucked up
still happened down there.

11:31.046 --> 11:34.116
Tom lured Sandy. Adam lured Tom.

11:34.141 --> 11:37.109
He's doing to them what they did to her.

11:38.895 --> 11:42.321
Hey. I need to know what
Jameson and Mother did to Sandy.

11:42.357 --> 11:45.523
- I told you, I don't know.
- You knew them.

11:45.898 --> 11:47.459
What would they do? What were they like?

11:47.494 --> 11:49.795
Mother was a controlling bitch,

11:49.820 --> 11:53.442
but Jameson... he was mean.

11:53.467 --> 11:54.699
Real mean.

11:54.735 --> 11:57.069
Especially to Sandy,
because he liked her.

11:57.104 --> 12:00.805
He liked that she was
dirty, odd, pathetic.

12:01.178 --> 12:04.041
But he hated that he liked that.

12:04.077 --> 12:07.178
I know it because he was
like that with me too.

12:12.485 --> 12:17.018
He had a habit of... of humiliating.

12:19.591 --> 12:21.958
So we needed the full
rundown on Sandy's clothes.

12:21.994 --> 12:23.393
They found all kinds of stains on it.

12:23.428 --> 12:25.395
There was rotten fruit,
and food and bacteria.

12:25.430 --> 12:27.230
- All kinds of...
- They threw garbage at her?

12:27.266 --> 12:28.532
Waste.

12:28.557 --> 12:30.566
He left a message at the church, Annie.

12:30.602 --> 12:33.766
A lion has come to
lay waste to your land.

12:33.791 --> 12:35.172
_

12:35.206 --> 12:36.839
He's telling us where to find them.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.790
Get him down!

13:09.138 --> 13:10.672
Think.

13:10.697 --> 13:14.032
You were in the woods. Tom lured her.

13:14.546 --> 13:16.179
You humiliated her.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.012
What about Lily? Where was she?

13:19.048 --> 13:20.914
What did she do?

13:20.950 --> 13:22.524
Everything.

13:22.549 --> 13:23.917
What do you mean everything?

13:23.953 --> 13:26.352
She did everything. She planned it.

13:26.387 --> 13:29.021
She told us to chase Sandy to scare her.

13:29.057 --> 13:30.522
You're disgusting.

13:30.558 --> 13:32.091
You're gross, Sandy.

13:32.126 --> 13:34.260
Everybody hates you!

13:34.295 --> 13:36.028
Dumb bitch.

13:36.075 --> 13:38.308
Get in there!

13:38.333 --> 13:40.199
Shut up!

13:40.235 --> 13:42.533
She locked Sandy in the shack?

13:42.693 --> 13:44.173
Why?

13:44.198 --> 13:45.885
She wanted to be Mary.

13:47.174 --> 13:50.375
You, you didn't take
things from Lily back then.

13:50.410 --> 13:51.609
Shut up, Sandy!

13:51.644 --> 13:53.411
Please, help!!

13:53.446 --> 13:55.380
- Shut up!
- Lily...

13:55.415 --> 13:57.015
What?

13:57.391 --> 13:59.350
So you just left her locked up there?

14:00.721 --> 14:03.696
We meant to go back, but...

14:03.722 --> 14:05.155
So the man who did this to you,

14:05.191 --> 14:07.758
did he say anything about
where he's taken Lily?

14:09.362 --> 14:10.794
Any kind of sound? Anything?

14:10.829 --> 14:12.796
Come on, man, think about it!

14:12.831 --> 14:14.999
I heard Sandy screaming,

14:16.534 --> 14:19.369
and then I became a priest.

14:21.172 --> 14:22.519
If she put someone in a shack,

14:22.544 --> 14:25.275
then she's in a small
space like a basement

14:25.310 --> 14:26.609
or a trunk of a car.

14:27.159 --> 14:29.879
Tom was near people. He
was meant to be found.

14:29.915 --> 14:31.647
Jameson lay waste.

14:31.682 --> 14:34.049
There was a clue, but
there's nothing here.

14:34.084 --> 14:35.650
Or anywhere?

14:35.685 --> 14:37.286
There is nothing in the old church.

14:37.321 --> 14:39.154
There is nothing in the shack.

14:41.144 --> 14:42.925
Because we have it all.

14:43.472 --> 14:45.327
We've figured out what they did.

14:45.823 --> 14:48.263
There are no more clues.

14:48.299 --> 14:49.997
We're not meant to find Lily.

14:50.033 --> 14:51.964
He wants her to die.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.371
I need an update on Lily
Mansfield, right now.

14:57.407 --> 14:59.340
I don't care what it is.
I just need something.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.508
Okay, who's with her family?
I need anything, please.

15:01.544 --> 15:03.377
- Just...
- I'm on it.

15:05.248 --> 15:07.580
He knows about everything
that happened that night.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.292
Things that nobody else knows about.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.131
You can see it, Annie.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.405
He killed Sandy.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.627
So why is he leading you on this path

15:21.663 --> 15:23.896
that just leads back to himself?

15:26.097 --> 15:29.268
This morning I tried to tell
him that it was all over,

15:30.284 --> 15:33.127
and he said, I don't understand him.

15:33.152 --> 15:36.687
That I needed to
understand why he did it.

15:36.722 --> 15:38.636
So if you understand him, is it...

15:38.652 --> 15:40.252
it's gonna lead to Lily?

15:42.255 --> 15:44.316
I think it's worth a shot.

15:44.906 --> 15:47.006
There's something you must know.

15:47.111 --> 15:50.058
He's been writing to you for years.

15:51.197 --> 15:53.297
He pretended to be your dad.

15:54.004 --> 15:55.541
Why?

15:58.261 --> 16:00.038
Maybe he knew the last time I saw my dad

16:00.063 --> 16:02.196
was screwed up.

16:03.074 --> 16:04.241
What do you mean screwed up?

16:04.276 --> 16:05.847
What was it?

16:06.067 --> 16:09.146
I don't know. I don't remember.

16:09.181 --> 16:11.515
He came into my room
and was acting weird.

16:11.550 --> 16:13.082
He came into your room?

16:13.118 --> 16:14.479
Was he crying?

16:14.504 --> 16:16.467
Did he sit on your bed?
Did he hold your hand?

16:16.492 --> 16:18.025
Annie, listen. You need
to think about this.

16:18.050 --> 16:19.916
- Why?
- You have the answer.

16:20.253 --> 16:21.873
Think.

16:26.248 --> 16:28.740
He said he ruins people.

16:30.473 --> 16:32.991
I hope it's not too late for you.

16:36.606 --> 16:39.452
See none of this made sense until now.

16:40.210 --> 16:41.576
He didn't kill himself

16:41.611 --> 16:43.241
because he couldn't
find Sandy's murderer.

16:43.266 --> 16:45.166
He killed himself because he did.

16:47.913 --> 16:51.046
He got pages from Horizons.

16:53.589 --> 16:55.522
He must've put Adam in Horizons

16:55.558 --> 16:57.591
when he found out that he murdered Sandy

16:57.626 --> 16:59.459
But why would he kill himself
and leave you with Adam?

16:59.495 --> 17:02.329
That makes no sense. He's a murderer.

17:07.234 --> 17:10.384
What if Sandy's murder
was the first riddle.

17:10.672 --> 17:13.087
She's pointing at the town.

17:13.112 --> 17:14.986
There's no sin...

17:15.609 --> 17:17.915
Find me where there is none.

17:19.946 --> 17:23.009
It's not original sin. It's no sin.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.775
Immaculate conception is without sin.

17:27.621 --> 17:30.255
There's no sin in Sandy's death.

17:31.425 --> 17:34.859
It wasn't murder. She wanted to die.

17:34.894 --> 17:36.994
I mean, she was bullied her whole life.

17:40.557 --> 17:42.462
He killed her...

17:44.437 --> 17:46.993
but it was mercy.

17:47.172 --> 17:49.759
He needs me to understand...

17:50.576 --> 17:52.618
that it was mercy.

17:53.379 --> 17:54.947
Mercy street.

17:54.972 --> 17:56.790
The brewery.

18:23.943 --> 18:25.409
Basement, all clear!

18:28.574 --> 18:30.106
Hey!

18:32.532 --> 18:34.164
A lily.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.199
A dead lily.

18:40.383 --> 18:42.745
We need bodies down here.

18:43.016 --> 18:45.082
We're gonna need some back up.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.923
Over here!

19:20.491 --> 19:22.735
Get some shovels over here!

19:30.298 --> 19:32.712
Give me that! Gimme that!

19:44.312 --> 19:46.312
Get it! Get it!

19:49.727 --> 19:51.370
Lily.

20:15.328 --> 20:17.056
Peter?

21:00.971 --> 21:02.270
Hey.

21:03.306 --> 21:04.706
Hi.

21:06.376 --> 21:08.043
I'm your uncle Adam.

21:08.078 --> 21:09.881
Don't be afraid.

21:14.717 --> 21:16.383
I'm sorry.

21:16.419 --> 21:19.493
I didn't want to scare
you. I'll, I'll go.

21:20.915 --> 21:22.657
It's okay.

21:22.926 --> 21:24.227
Wait.

21:29.485 --> 21:31.197
You're the one who leaves the riddles.

21:31.232 --> 21:32.832
Yeah.

21:34.335 --> 21:35.891
Can I come in?

21:42.729 --> 21:44.282
Whoa.

21:49.316 --> 21:52.063
You wrote on my mom's car.

21:52.587 --> 21:55.290
I was in there when you did that.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.711
I'm sorry.

22:03.506 --> 22:05.340
My mom always thought it was Grandpa

22:05.365 --> 22:08.475
who left her the riddles
when she was a kid.

22:09.569 --> 22:11.402
I never met him.

22:11.437 --> 22:13.104
I did.

22:13.358 --> 22:15.217
Did you like him?

22:16.576 --> 22:19.686
Ah, he was complicated.

22:21.747 --> 22:24.280
He thought he was doing the right thing,

22:24.316 --> 22:27.428
but he'd over-think and...

22:27.519 --> 22:31.421
end up doing things
that were untrue to him.

22:31.737 --> 22:33.741
Not like your mom.

22:35.192 --> 22:38.327
Over-thinking isn't my mom's problem.

22:38.362 --> 22:41.296
Yeah. Right.

22:45.003 --> 22:46.869
Hey, I'm having a nice moment with you.

22:46.904 --> 22:48.671
Thank you.

22:51.207 --> 22:54.835
Why didn't my mom grow up with you?

22:56.485 --> 22:58.835
Because I scared her mom.

23:00.117 --> 23:03.608
Then why did you leave the riddles?

23:05.388 --> 23:08.555
I always found when
I'm direct with people,

23:08.590 --> 23:10.531
I scare them.

23:12.231 --> 23:14.231
They misunderstand me,

23:15.031 --> 23:17.865
or I misunderstand them, but either way,

23:17.900 --> 23:20.750
it just made sense at the time.

23:21.503 --> 23:23.671
People think I'm weird too.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.101
Oh yeah?

23:25.940 --> 23:28.741
I tried to conjure Sandy Driver's spirit

23:28.777 --> 23:31.992
because I thought she
could help find Jesse.

23:32.937 --> 23:34.346
It's weird.

23:34.382 --> 23:35.725
No.

23:36.069 --> 23:37.663
That's cool.

23:39.975 --> 23:42.803
You try and help your mom a lot, huh?

23:43.487 --> 23:46.921
Why think Sandy could help find Jesse?

23:49.654 --> 23:53.508
I feel that... she would like Jesse.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.501
Oh yeah. She would of.

23:58.371 --> 24:01.748
Oh yeah, they were very similar.

24:02.041 --> 24:05.843
They were treated the same by bullies.

24:05.878 --> 24:09.598
St. Paul emphasizes
helping those among us

24:09.623 --> 24:12.083
who are tempted by a dark path.

24:17.823 --> 24:22.291
I got in trouble for doing
a presentation on Sandy.

24:22.491 --> 24:24.493
It was good.

24:24.529 --> 24:27.430
It would've been better
if I knew how it ended,

24:27.465 --> 24:30.522
but nobody does.

24:32.503 --> 24:35.670
Would you like an ending
to your project, Daisy?

24:36.323 --> 24:37.823
Yeah.

24:38.275 --> 24:39.845
Me too.

24:42.205 --> 24:44.512
Highway patrol is checking all vehicles.

24:44.548 --> 24:46.381
So far nothing.

24:46.416 --> 24:48.951
Sudbury is alerted to look
out for a dark haired man.

24:48.986 --> 24:50.533
Annie!

24:51.822 --> 24:54.195
I thought she was in
her room at my place.

24:54.220 --> 24:56.166
Call her phone!

24:56.392 --> 24:59.127
I went to your house. She wasn't there.

24:59.162 --> 25:00.995
It's Adam!

25:02.698 --> 25:05.366
- He goes to the riddle tree.
- What?

25:05.401 --> 25:07.462
He leaves me messages.

25:12.574 --> 25:14.674
Nothing. Shit!

25:14.709 --> 25:17.522
- Where else, Annie?
- Um, the church or the shack.

25:17.547 --> 25:18.845
What the fuck is the shack?

25:18.881 --> 25:20.981
- What if we don't find her?
- We will. We will.

25:21.016 --> 25:22.983
Come on! Come on!!

25:28.329 --> 25:29.923
Daisy?!

25:30.672 --> 25:32.064
Anything?

25:32.381 --> 25:34.648
- Where is she, Annie?!
- I don't know.

25:38.839 --> 25:40.671
Peter?

25:42.968 --> 25:45.176
What are you doing here?

25:45.212 --> 25:46.811
Oh shit!

25:48.562 --> 25:49.851
Stay here!

25:49.954 --> 25:51.990
- What, you fucking insane?
- Peter!

25:52.015 --> 25:53.251
He's got my kid!

25:53.286 --> 25:54.359
- He's got our kid!
- Peter!

25:54.384 --> 25:55.786
He's gonna fucking kill her.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.787
I can draw him out if I'm alone.

25:57.823 --> 26:01.262
Eddie, Eddie. It's about me.

26:01.394 --> 26:03.127
He'll give her to me.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.777
Annie!

26:04.802 --> 26:06.231
Hey, get off me!

26:06.256 --> 26:08.165
Eddie, stop it. Stop it!

26:08.200 --> 26:10.167
We'll give her five minutes
and we'll go after him, okay?

26:10.202 --> 26:11.512
Get off me!

26:11.537 --> 26:12.770
Get off.

26:12.795 --> 26:15.661
He hurts my kid?! Peter!

26:24.215 --> 26:25.714
Daisy?!

26:29.483 --> 26:30.748
Daisy!

26:33.557 --> 26:35.410
Daisy!

26:40.151 --> 26:41.917
Stop.

26:42.124 --> 26:43.379
Stop.

26:43.590 --> 26:44.799
Stop!

26:44.834 --> 26:46.738
Daisy!

26:50.504 --> 26:52.139
What's the matter, you cold?

26:52.175 --> 26:54.175
She's getting exactly what she deserved.

26:54.210 --> 26:56.097
C'mon, it's funny.

26:56.668 --> 27:00.191
Nobody likes you. Everybody hates you.

27:00.590 --> 27:03.061
You're a freak, Sandy. Shut up!

27:13.795 --> 27:16.117
Daisy! Daisy.

27:16.142 --> 27:17.830
Oh my God.

27:18.781 --> 27:20.600
Did he hurt you?

27:20.635 --> 27:22.134
Your dad's down there. Take this.

27:22.169 --> 27:24.936
Run. I'll be right there. Run!

27:26.373 --> 27:28.828
You took my fucking kid?!

27:30.054 --> 27:31.776
What do you want from me?

27:31.812 --> 27:34.523
I wanted you to feel it for yourself.

27:35.349 --> 27:37.015
I needed you to see all of me.

27:37.050 --> 27:38.757
You killed her.

27:39.819 --> 27:41.452
You killed her, but she wanted to die.

27:41.488 --> 27:43.156
It was mercy.

27:44.561 --> 27:46.335
I came here.

27:46.692 --> 27:48.326
I'd sneak out of the military school

27:48.361 --> 27:49.927
just to watch you and Dad

27:49.962 --> 27:52.210
when you didn't even know I was there.

27:52.665 --> 27:55.195
One day, it was Christmas,

27:55.690 --> 27:58.101
I thought he was gonna let me in.

27:58.137 --> 28:01.070
- No-no-no, you can't be here.
- I'm your son.

28:01.106 --> 28:04.207
- You can't be here.
- "You scare people."

28:04.243 --> 28:06.443
- You can't make me leave!
- "You're violent."

28:06.478 --> 28:07.910
She's mine too.

28:07.946 --> 28:09.879
You hurt your step-mom.
You can't be here.

28:09.914 --> 28:12.214
That's because she
tried to take away Annie.

28:12.250 --> 28:15.518
- You got to let me in Dad.
- You gotta leave.

28:16.521 --> 28:18.888
"The way you are with your sister..."

28:19.790 --> 28:21.590
She's my sister!

28:21.626 --> 28:24.993
Come on, Dad, let me in. She's mine too.

28:25.029 --> 28:27.829
You got to leave now. You hear me?

28:27.865 --> 28:30.131
"I wish you never existed."

28:30.167 --> 28:31.666
Don't you come back!

28:34.027 --> 28:36.227
I hate you! I hate you!

28:37.207 --> 28:40.084
Ahhh! I hate you!

28:40.109 --> 28:42.377
I hate you!

28:42.402 --> 28:44.069
Ahhh!

28:46.930 --> 28:48.178
Someone! Help!

28:52.442 --> 28:53.975
Ahhh!

28:54.000 --> 28:55.734
Help!

29:04.875 --> 29:07.639
Help! Help!

29:07.664 --> 29:10.065
Someone!

29:12.336 --> 29:14.084
Someone!

29:32.192 --> 29:34.540
You didn't know her before that?

29:35.102 --> 29:36.665
No.

29:37.030 --> 29:38.798
But it was like...

29:39.265 --> 29:42.099
we knew each other
instantly at that moment.

30:21.204 --> 30:23.739
Other people get to
be with their families!

30:23.774 --> 30:25.367
They'll never leave me alone.

30:25.392 --> 30:28.196
Why do they make me wanna die?

30:28.844 --> 30:31.078
Why do they hate me?

30:33.125 --> 30:35.358
What's wrong with me?

30:55.586 --> 30:57.499
I think maybe...

30:57.524 --> 30:59.546
we don't belong here.

31:07.304 --> 31:09.715
I don't wanna be alive anymore.

31:09.750 --> 31:11.218
No.

31:11.243 --> 31:12.584
No.

31:15.756 --> 31:17.255
Please.

31:17.291 --> 31:18.817
Please.

31:23.262 --> 31:27.532
We knew no one would ever
understand the pain we felt.

31:30.005 --> 31:32.236
Unless we made them.

31:49.655 --> 31:53.189
She wanted me to make them
feel what they had done.

31:56.961 --> 31:59.280
Then I was supposed to do it too.

32:06.707 --> 32:08.973
A suicide pact.

32:12.642 --> 32:14.909
Why did you do it this way?

32:15.945 --> 32:19.266
Why didn't you just talk
to me when I was seven?

32:20.149 --> 32:23.040
I live in my childhood
house 'cause of you.

32:23.520 --> 32:27.102
Somewhere in the recesses of my mind.

32:28.691 --> 32:31.477
I thought that my dad might come back,

32:32.070 --> 32:34.173
and if I left,

32:35.230 --> 32:37.303
he wouldn't find me.

32:38.100 --> 32:39.867
I thought that he left

32:39.902 --> 32:43.537
because I could not
solve a fucking riddle.

32:45.373 --> 32:49.693
And that's not real,
but it doesn't matter

32:51.178 --> 32:53.679
'cause what is real...

32:53.715 --> 32:55.483
is that I wasn't enough...

32:55.508 --> 32:58.623
to make him not kill himself.

32:58.866 --> 33:01.433
It was about you!

33:01.688 --> 33:03.904
The riddles. It was you!

33:05.191 --> 33:07.826
The reasons for killing himself was you!

33:07.871 --> 33:09.221
It was always about you.

33:09.246 --> 33:10.806
- It wasn't about me!
- I am you.

33:10.831 --> 33:14.032
I am you. You are me.

33:14.067 --> 33:16.067
Don't you get it?

33:17.538 --> 33:19.330
We're the same!

33:20.267 --> 33:21.872
I'm alive because of you!

33:21.908 --> 33:24.207
You are what you are because of me!

33:24.232 --> 33:26.800
We are not the same.

33:26.846 --> 33:28.712
How many people would do what you did?

33:28.748 --> 33:30.247
Invite me in?

33:30.282 --> 33:32.483
You chose me over your own family.

33:32.518 --> 33:33.908
No.

33:34.487 --> 33:37.142
Why do you think I brought Daisy here?

33:38.289 --> 33:40.861
She wanted to be a part of the story.

33:41.860 --> 33:44.994
It's the only way she thought
of to connect with you again.

33:45.029 --> 33:46.807
- Stop...
- Bit now she is.

33:46.832 --> 33:48.130
She's part of the end.

33:48.166 --> 33:49.933
- Stop talking! Stop!
- Part of the end!

33:49.968 --> 33:51.611
It's okay.

33:52.082 --> 33:54.642
It was always about you too.

34:03.881 --> 34:05.728
I was going to,

34:07.419 --> 34:09.152
then I thought...

34:10.219 --> 34:12.041
what if one day,

34:14.069 --> 34:16.260
what if someone could see me.

34:17.677 --> 34:19.299
Could just...

34:21.558 --> 34:25.338
the only times I was
ever okay was with you.

34:28.331 --> 34:29.844
It's okay.

34:53.628 --> 34:55.360
Ohh...

35:04.671 --> 35:06.671
I can't.

35:09.175 --> 35:10.542
Uh.

35:11.811 --> 35:13.244
No.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.542
All right.

35:16.215 --> 35:17.581
I can't.

35:18.153 --> 35:19.282
I can't.

35:19.317 --> 35:22.452
It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry.

35:22.487 --> 35:25.255
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.857
Thank you.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.704
Just do it.

35:34.729 --> 35:36.832
Stop. No. I can't.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.799
Yes you can. Yes you can.

35:38.824 --> 35:40.770
Just do it!

35:40.805 --> 35:42.772
Ahh! Oh!!

35:43.942 --> 35:45.393
Annie!

35:48.786 --> 35:51.720
- Annie!
- Annie!

35:52.115 --> 35:53.526
Annie!

36:34.504 --> 36:35.800
You're not packed yet?

36:37.418 --> 36:39.551
If you don't hurry
we'll leave without you.

36:39.597 --> 36:42.498
- I'm serious.
- Dad, stop.

36:42.533 --> 36:44.666
I will put you in a suitcase.

36:49.784 --> 36:51.082
Hey.

36:55.863 --> 36:57.760
I'm sorry I, I didn't, uh...

36:57.785 --> 36:59.340
Where were you?

37:00.394 --> 37:03.474
I had to check out. For a bit.

37:03.980 --> 37:05.729
I didn't even hear from you.

37:05.754 --> 37:07.619
Uh, you had Eddie.

37:07.654 --> 37:09.721
You had your family, so.

37:10.891 --> 37:13.225
I also needed you.

37:15.195 --> 37:16.527
What, you're just gonna go?

37:16.552 --> 37:20.010
You're gonna lock up your
house like your dad's cabin

37:20.035 --> 37:23.832
and hope that all the shit
that went on stays locked up?

37:25.821 --> 37:27.411
I'm fine.

37:28.607 --> 37:30.574
No, you're not fine.

37:30.609 --> 37:32.609
You killed your brother.

37:34.013 --> 37:35.479
He has the same face as your father.

37:35.514 --> 37:38.591
That, that shit's not gonna go away.

37:39.385 --> 37:42.161
He was gonna kill me.

37:43.901 --> 37:45.451
I'm fine.

37:51.810 --> 37:53.163
You're fine, are you?

37:53.198 --> 37:54.840
- Annie?
- Let go.

37:54.865 --> 37:55.964
Hey.

37:55.989 --> 37:57.356
We're having a moment. It's okay.

37:57.381 --> 37:58.545
It doesn't look okay.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.338
Hey, come here. Come here. Come here.

38:00.363 --> 38:01.995
What is that? You're just
gonna shove her into your truck

38:02.020 --> 38:03.082
and hope it all goes away?

38:03.107 --> 38:04.974
Getting her into the
truck is how it goes away.

38:04.999 --> 38:06.402
Getting her out of this place
is how she's gonna be okay.

38:06.427 --> 38:08.193
You're wrong. You're just
thinking about yourself

38:08.218 --> 38:09.746
- when she needs...
- Oh, am I? Am I the one doing that?

38:09.771 --> 38:10.895
- Yes.
- Okay!

38:11.749 --> 38:13.887
I just need to say goodbye, okay.

38:19.710 --> 38:21.410
Hey, kiddo.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.514
Hey, Pipsqueak Ryder.

38:28.752 --> 38:30.179
Come on.

38:30.204 --> 38:31.377
See you in a sec.

38:41.864 --> 38:44.965
When you were a little girl,
I found you in the woods.

38:46.403 --> 38:49.583
You had done that to your arm...

38:51.473 --> 38:54.563
and I remember thinking
that I gotta love this kid.

38:56.745 --> 38:59.512
I gotta fill this hole
that'll never be filled,

38:59.548 --> 39:01.111
but I gotta try.

39:01.136 --> 39:02.931
And I did.

39:03.740 --> 39:06.172
I'm-I'm still doing it.

39:06.646 --> 39:07.977
But it...

39:09.080 --> 39:10.658
I didn't...

39:16.064 --> 39:17.363
And then all this shit that you're gonna

39:17.398 --> 39:19.454
have to deal with right now.

39:19.600 --> 39:23.423
I understand that it's,
that it's my fault.

39:24.592 --> 39:26.092
It is.

39:27.774 --> 39:29.407
Adam...

39:29.443 --> 39:32.110
I almost killed him so
you wouldn't have to.

39:33.680 --> 39:36.348
And I would have fucking killed him.

39:39.252 --> 39:41.085
But he got in my head.

39:42.621 --> 39:44.554
He said something to me...

39:46.292 --> 39:47.624
and I need to tell you what it is.

39:47.659 --> 39:49.032
Please don't.

39:52.098 --> 39:55.673
All I wanted all my life was to
understand what I didn't know,

39:55.698 --> 39:58.891
and now that I do, it's so much worse.

40:01.906 --> 40:03.212
If I hadn't needed to know,

40:03.283 --> 40:05.708
I wouldn't have known that
my dad ruined my brother.

40:05.743 --> 40:07.877
I wouldn't have needed
to know who Adam was...

40:07.912 --> 40:09.642
and I wouldn't have needed
to clean his blood off me,

40:09.667 --> 40:11.280
- so just...
- It's...

40:11.316 --> 40:12.848
Just don't.

40:13.951 --> 40:16.251
If you're about to say something...

40:16.286 --> 40:18.650
that you don't want to say,

40:19.079 --> 40:21.439
but you think truth is the answer,

40:25.618 --> 40:27.290
please don't.

40:28.132 --> 40:31.173
I don't want to know anything
else that's gonna fuck me up.

40:33.403 --> 40:35.626
Is this gonna fuck me up?

40:38.174 --> 40:39.704
It might.

40:42.345 --> 40:44.512
Then can you just live with it?

40:49.413 --> 40:50.739
Go.

40:52.887 --> 40:54.921
Go. Please.

41:04.366 --> 41:05.931
Are your ready?

41:07.101 --> 41:08.284
Yeah.

41:25.191 --> 41:26.451
Oh...

42:04.123 --> 42:06.899
- Ow, Mom, stop.
- Sorry.

42:22.473 --> 42:25.112
Oh, there's just one
thing I would like to say

42:25.137 --> 42:28.855
before this all ends happily for you.

42:28.973 --> 42:32.479
You love her. You've loved
her ever since she was a kid.

42:32.957 --> 42:36.517
And you've just been waiting and waiting

42:36.552 --> 42:39.395
and waiting for her to grow up,

42:39.420 --> 42:41.586
so you can just...
