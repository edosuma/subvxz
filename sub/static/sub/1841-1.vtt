[GUNSHOT]

02:55.967 --> 02:58.846
Hi, Bill.

02:58.929 --> 03:01.853
I knocked. You know,
there's no answer.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.775
I thought, you know,
you drowned or something.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.898
Sorry, I...

03:05.977 --> 03:10.528
I didn't drown.
I'm just having a bath.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.326
Charlie, it's time.
Your morn, she--

03:13.402 --> 03:14.779
They called?
Yeah.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.381
It's Sambuca.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.977
Put this
in your pocket.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.448
<i>We switched
to a manual apparatus</i>

03:51.523 --> 03:54.993
<i>which enables us
to ease her out.</i>

03:55.068 --> 03:57.366
<i>Out where?</i>

03:57.446 --> 04:02.122
<i>Mr. Green, I honestly think you're
doing the right thing here.</i>

04:17.214 --> 04:18.432
Can I have
one of those?

04:18.507 --> 04:20.930
They're
for my back.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.935
Can we say for now that
my back hurts too, Bill?

04:24.014 --> 04:26.893
Two is the ticket if it
hurts as much as mine does.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.809
This is what happens.
Are you ready?

06:02.237 --> 06:05.081
<i>Took a powder,
eh, Charlie?</i>

06:10.537 --> 06:13.632
I'm sorry, it's just that-that
I feel horrible now.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.756
I blame myself, Charlie. I
was never very good at it.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.213
At what?
Being a mom.

06:19.296 --> 06:23.972
No, mom. That's not true. You were good.
You were great.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.930
Weren't you?

06:28.013 --> 06:32.234
I was always so wrapped
up in my own crap.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.358
Meeting Greg and
leaving your dad.

06:35.437 --> 06:38.236
And meeting Bill
and leaving Greg.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.908
I could never
get the sequences right.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.701
You are
a complicated lady.

06:41.776 --> 06:42.948
I didn't mean to be.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.326
Were. I know,
I know.

06:45.405 --> 06:51.128
And I sure didn't mean for you to
be running out on death scenes.

06:51.202 --> 06:56.333
And just floating through your
entire existence, Charlie.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.213
I'm the one
who's sorry, kiddo.

07:01.296 --> 07:06.223
What do I do now? I still got a
whole life to go now, you know?

07:06.301 --> 07:08.224
Did we not just say that
was never my thing?

07:08.303 --> 07:11.307
Please, Mom. I need you
to be specific now.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.108
Just this once.
Tell me what to do.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.526
I got it.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.233
Go to Bucharest.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.034
Bucharest?

07:24.110 --> 07:26.408
Yeah.
Go to Bucharest.

07:26.488 --> 07:27.865
Why, Mom?

07:27.948 --> 07:30.918
I don't know.
It seems specific.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.960
Just do it,
Charlie.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.130
Say you promise.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.842
I promise.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.719
Good.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.301
I have to go now,
Charlie.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.274
Mom, wait a second,
I got this--

07:54.349 --> 07:57.193
I have this horrible
visual in my head of you.

07:57.268 --> 08:01.614
<i>I need something nicer,
something fun...</i>

08:01.690 --> 08:06.036
<i>Oh, Charlie...
oh, you goof.</i>

08:06.111 --> 08:08.034
Come here.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.849
<i>Better?</i>

08:27.924 --> 08:28.891

08:28.967 --> 08:30.469
<i>Okay, good.</i>

09:13.970 --> 09:15.813
Charles?

09:15.889 --> 09:18.642
It's okay.
Just give us a minute.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.274
We're not together
anymore. Go home.

09:21.352 --> 09:28.110
Oh, no. Ted.
Oh, my God. Ted.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.946
Yeah, you're not funny.
Go home. Yeah.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.366
Yo, Ashley,
everything cool?

09:34.449 --> 09:36.076
It's fine,
just give us a minute.

not thinking of Budapest?

really nice there.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.750
You didn't want
to go to Budapest?

11:44.829 --> 11:47.127
No, I was just kinda...

11:47.207 --> 11:51.383
Yeah, Bucharest. Just spur of the
moment kind of thing, you know?

11:51.461 --> 11:54.681

this kind of thing.

want to speak with me.

No, I just--
No trouble for me. No.

speaking or if you wanted your own time.

12:08.353 --> 12:11.527
I speak with you first and you're
not sure I want to speak with you?

12:11.606 --> 12:14.325

to be working, no?

12:14.400 --> 12:17.119
Yeah, I'm sorry. That's sort
of why I'm going on this trip.

If you don't mind me

up in Chicago when
you're from Romania?

12:33.628 --> 12:35.505

Why the Cubs, though? I mean,
there's other better teams.

12:51.896 --> 12:54.945
The Cubs are pretty--
It's a shitty team.

12:55.024 --> 12:58.528
Yes! The Cubbies will never win
the Worlds Championship Series.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.957
Of course not. Never,
never, never. No.

13:03.032 --> 13:07.458

many problems in history, too.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.185
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, take a seat.

39:51.264 --> 39:53.813
So, you guys been
here for a while or...?

39:53.892 --> 39:57.487
I've been here...
let me think...

39:57.562 --> 39:59.314
Week? Few weeks?

39:59.397 --> 40:01.320
Couple of months?
I don't know.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.619
It's been a bit of a blur,
I got to be honest, Charlie.

40:04.694 --> 40:07.789
<i>Been here six days,
Charlie.</i>

40:07.864 --> 40:09.662
Oh, you're not together?

40:09.741 --> 40:11.743
<i>You know, like traveling
together, I meant.</i>

40:11.826 --> 40:14.670
Relax, okay? Look, he's not
my type, with him being ginger.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.339
<i>Not having a pussy.
You get what I mean?</i>

40:16.414 --> 40:17.916
Right, right, right.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.546
<i>You just get in today?</i>
Yes. Today.

40:19.626 --> 40:22.095
Yeah? Where you come from?
Chicago.

40:22.170 --> 40:25.140
Chicago?
Hey, Chi-ca-go!

40:25.214 --> 40:28.013
That's my kind of town.
Is it?

40:28.092 --> 40:30.515
Yeah, well,
I've never been.

40:30.595 --> 40:34.441
You like ecstasy,
Charlie?

40:37.518 --> 40:42.399
In answer to your silent question,
Charlie, this is why I love this guy.

40:42.523 --> 40:45.697
<i>He's fucking crazy! He's a party animal!</i>
Yes.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.996
<i>We should go and get a few beers
or something. You up for that?</i>

40:48.071 --> 40:49.869
Beer? Yeah.
Yeah?

40:49.948 --> 40:52.451
Great. Well, first round's on you.
Come, let's go!

40:52.533 --> 40:54.331
Three beers for
the three queers.

40:54.410 --> 40:56.458
Thank you, sir.

40:56.537 --> 40:59.882
Did Carl tell you? He's auditioning
to become a porn star.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.211
Porn star?
<i>Actor. You know.</i>

41:02.293 --> 41:05.388
I have no aspirations to star.
I simply want to act.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.386
That is funny.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.092
Tell him what your <i>nom de
porn</i> is going to be.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.927
Boris Pecker.

41:13.221 --> 41:16.350
<i>Can you fucking--
There is no other name?</i>

41:16.432 --> 41:17.684
Boris!
Boris Pecker.

41:17.767 --> 41:19.519
<i>It could be nowhere else!</i>

41:19.602 --> 41:21.104
<i>It's just like--</i>

41:21.187 --> 41:22.939
I feel fucking weird
right now, man.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.533
<i>Charlie, Charlie. I feel
fucked right now, man.</i>

41:25.608 --> 41:27.155
How's your beer,
how's your beer?

41:27.235 --> 41:30.114
I just feel fucked
right now. I mean...

41:30.196 --> 41:33.575
Can I tell you my story?
Yeah.

41:33.658 --> 41:37.003
So, this guy Victor, he died on my
fucking plane right next to me.

41:37.078 --> 41:39.001
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

41:39.080 --> 41:42.584
And he gives me a hat, and
it's a gift for his daughter.

41:42.709 --> 41:46.339
Her name's Gabi. Gabriela.
Right.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.173
And she plays the cello.

41:48.256 --> 41:49.974
Cello!
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:50.049 --> 41:53.929
When you hear her talk,
your fucking heart stops.

41:54.012 --> 41:57.107
Fucking amazing. This
beer's weird as shit, but--

41:57.181 --> 41:59.400
Having a good time?
'Cause it looks like

41:59.475 --> 42:00.852
you're having a
motherfucking good time.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.029
Amazing. I felt
like I love her.

42:03.104 --> 42:05.232
I do, I do, I do!
I feel like I love her.

42:05.314 --> 42:08.158
I have to make you aware,
Charlie.

42:08.234 --> 42:12.364
Luke put Carpathian
ecstasy in your beer.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.791
You did? Who did?
Yeah, yeah!

42:14.866 --> 42:17.039
I did. Come on,
listen...

42:17.118 --> 42:18.290
Well, fuck, man!

42:18.369 --> 42:19.621
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

42:19.704 --> 42:21.422
No, no,
it's fine, though!

42:21.497 --> 42:23.295
<i>It's fine. Mine
and Carl's are laced too.</i>

42:23.374 --> 42:26.469
We all have fucking
trolley's at the moment.

42:26.544 --> 42:29.969
We're all in a zone
of mutuality.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.595
We're all together,
rising sun.

42:31.674 --> 42:33.267
<i>There's a naked girl!</i>

42:33.342 --> 42:35.561
Listen, your experience
is your own, yeah?

42:35.636 --> 42:38.765
But we vote on shared
hallucinations, okay?

42:38.848 --> 42:43.319
Any hallucinations in the zone
of mutuality must be voted on.

42:43.394 --> 42:50.243
Who here among us would like all the women
to be naked or semi-naked right now?

42:50.318 --> 42:52.161
All right.

42:52.236 --> 42:54.534
<i>There is. Oh, my God.
Having a good time?</i>

42:54.614 --> 42:56.582
These women are naked.

42:56.657 --> 42:58.500
This is my gift to you.
Merry Christmas.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.499
Oh, my Go oh, my God!

44:25.997 --> 44:27.999
<i>Hello, Charlie.</i>

44:32.920 --> 44:37.892
Are you in the zone
of individuality also?

44:37.967 --> 44:40.265
Sure.

44:40.344 --> 44:41.470
Sure. Why not?

44:41.554 --> 44:43.431
Okay.

44:43.514 --> 44:47.860
Listen, I'm glad we bumped
into each other like this.

44:47.935 --> 44:52.156
I want to apologize
for my behavior.

44:56.777 --> 44:59.781
Charlie. The fucking love,
Charlie. The fucking love.

44:59.864 --> 45:04.370
[LAUGHS WEAKLY]
Yeah, sure.

45:04.452 --> 45:07.046
Turns me somewhat insane, if
I'm being honest with you.

45:07.121 --> 45:08.623
Can I tell you that?

45:08.706 --> 45:10.504
Be honest with me.

45:13.711 --> 45:16.965
Regardless,
I do apologize.

45:18.716 --> 45:21.811
But I didn't
wash my hands.

45:21.886 --> 45:25.231
What's a little piss
among friends?

45:27.016 --> 45:29.519
Oh, Charlie.

45:29.602 --> 45:32.401
Enjoy your new mates
and your recreational drugs

45:32.480 --> 45:35.074
and the rest of it
while you can.

45:35.149 --> 45:39.325
God knows it can all turn into
blood in a blink of an eye.

45:39.403 --> 45:40.746
Yes.

46:22.613 --> 46:25.207
Your bag was
in my car, Charlie.

46:25.283 --> 46:28.378
I left it at the
hostel for you, okay?

46:28.452 --> 46:31.376
You're married?
What's up with that?

46:31.455 --> 46:35.926
Walking with me? It
could get you killed.

46:36.002 --> 46:37.845
Charlie! I'll just walk
across the street.

46:37.920 --> 46:40.014
I'll walk right
here in the street.

46:56.480 --> 46:59.575
I'm going to help you. It's good.
What are doing?

47:53.037 --> 47:56.041
[BOTH SIGH]

48:15.476 --> 48:18.571
You want to share
a cavalla?

48:20.564 --> 48:23.033
Maybe on our
second date.

48:28.489 --> 48:29.741
<i>You like it?</i>

48:31.617 --> 48:34.917
It's my mother's
favorite song.

48:36.747 --> 48:40.593
This was my father's
favorite restaurant.

48:44.922 --> 48:49.348
I used to play cello right
here when I was young.

48:49.427 --> 48:54.354
My father hated that he put me
in the place where I met Nigel.

48:54.432 --> 49:01.407
He once ran through here cursing and
throwing candles at the curtains.

49:03.691 --> 49:06.945
It didn't work.
He was very drunk.

49:13.784 --> 49:17.630
Good place to be drunk.

49:17.705 --> 49:21.335
Good sober food. I mean,
these are great doughnuts.

49:21.417 --> 49:23.385
The best.

49:25.671 --> 49:28.925
Gabi, can I
say something?

49:30.134 --> 49:33.354
I understand.

49:33.429 --> 49:36.649
When you lose
someone who's

49:36.724 --> 49:40.729
your home, you know, you're
only home in the world.

49:40.811 --> 49:42.484
And when that happens,
you think,

49:42.563 --> 49:45.692
"Oh, fuck, I should
have had a back-up home."

49:45.774 --> 49:50.951
Another person, a place,
a thing, something

49:51.030 --> 49:55.752
to make me feel safe,
and I don't have that.

49:55.826 --> 49:57.578
And now I'm lost.

49:57.661 --> 49:59.663
I am not lost.

49:59.747 --> 50:01.749
<i>It's a process.</i>

50:04.793 --> 50:06.761
I am angry.

50:15.846 --> 50:19.020
That's why
I'm scared for you.

50:19.099 --> 50:22.194
You know, for that
picture in your head.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.192
Close your eyes.

50:29.735 --> 50:32.864
Get rid of that one.
That one's gone.

50:32.947 --> 50:36.747
That's gone.
Blank slate.

50:41.121 --> 50:44.216
Pick a good one, a really good one.
One that's so good

50:44.291 --> 50:46.714
it'll keep
the bad one unstuck.

51:10.734 --> 51:13.328
See?

51:23.789 --> 51:25.757
Thank you,
Charlie.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.770
What are you doing?

51:41.849 --> 51:43.567
I'm going to show you
all these that I know.

Time for goodbye,
Charlie.

52:04.872 --> 52:07.716
No! We should
go walk some more.

52:07.791 --> 52:10.886
Let's do it again. Let's just
do the whole path again.

52:10.961 --> 52:13.635
It's a full moon! We get
bikes, we go ride around.

52:13.714 --> 52:15.136
We can do anything.
We'll get pancakes.

52:15.215 --> 52:17.638
No, I am sorry.
Why?

52:17.718 --> 52:19.686
It's like they say, another
time, another place. Right?

52:19.762 --> 52:22.231

put the future and the past into, right?
