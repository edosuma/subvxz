WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:03.761
If you had asked me six years
ago what I would be doing now,

00:03.800 --> 00:06.030
it would not be running
for state's attorney.

00:06.070 --> 00:07.628
JOHNNY:
Let me see a show of hands.

00:07.670 --> 00:10.036
If the election for state's
attorney were held today,

00:10.070 --> 00:11.662
how many of you would vote
for Alicia Florrick?

00:11.710 --> 00:15.271
That's seven for _
and, I Imagine, five against.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.505
I'm not really against her.
I just need to hear more.
WOMAN: I'm just voting

00:17.550 --> 00:20.178
for her here because I like her,
but I don't know much about her.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.642
Well, let's explore that, Rita.
What is it you like about her?

00:21.680 --> 00:23.113
I guess how
she handled her marriage.

00:23.150 --> 00:24.481
She stood by her husband.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.112
See, that's what
I don't like about her.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.616
Why didn't she divorce him?

00:27.660 --> 00:31.187
He slept with all of those
prostitutes, and she just grins.

00:31.230 --> 00:32.822
RITA:
That's what you do,

00:32.860 --> 00:34.589
through sickness and health.
MAN 2:
What I don't get is what

00:34.630 --> 00:36.222
this has to do with her being
a state's attorney.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.259
It matters if she's a doormat.

00:37.300 --> 00:39.336
It matters if she has...
JOHNNY:
Okay, all right.

00:39.370 --> 00:41.065
I want to turn, uh,
to another subject, if I may.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.500
Frank Prady.
What do people think of him?
Who's that?

00:43.540 --> 00:46.839
Oh, yeah, him-- the guy
on the news. He's good.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.144
Is he running?
_ He hasn't make
his announcement yet,

00:49.180 --> 00:50.841
but the expectation is
that he'll run.
MAN 1:
I like him.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.711
He's smart and funny.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.672
So let me ask the same question.
If the elections were held

00:54.720 --> 00:57.484
today, how many of you
would vote for Frank Prady?

00:57.520 --> 00:59.181
Eight. So, someone
switched sides.

00:59.220 --> 01:00.414
Was it you, Reggie?

01:00.460 --> 01:02.451
Alicia, where are you?
We need to discuss this.

01:02.490 --> 01:04.151
I have to do some work, Eli.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.658
I'll meet you when I'm done.

01:06.700 --> 01:10.568
Owen, what a surprise.
Eli, I will call you back.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.591
Your receptionist said
I could wait in here.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.494
No, I'm thrilled.
Stand up.

01:14.540 --> 01:16.633
Give me a hug.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.179
What's wrong?

01:21.210 --> 01:22.643
Nothing. How's your campaign?

01:25.480 --> 01:28.210
Look, Owen, I'm sorry.

01:28.250 --> 01:31.185
I should not have questioned
your relationship with Phil.

01:31.220 --> 01:33.188
I won't do it again.
I apologize.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.778
Thank you.

01:34.820 --> 01:36.583
He's a good guy.
I bet he is.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.224
And I'm not gonna
hurt your campaign.
I know.

01:39.260 --> 01:41.694
(sighs)
So, how's school?

01:41.730 --> 01:43.129
It's good.

01:43.170 --> 01:44.797
I have a case for you.

01:44.830 --> 01:46.161
What do you mean?

01:46.200 --> 01:47.861
One of my students--
she was raped.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.835
She is going in front of the
university judiciary committee

01:50.870 --> 01:53.475
today to try and get
the guy expelled.

01:53.510 --> 01:54.909
She didn't go
to the police

01:54.940 --> 01:56.669
because she doesn't want
to overturn her life.

01:56.710 --> 01:59.213
She just wants him
out of her classes.
Okay.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.139
Oh, that sounds like
a get-out-of-my-office okay.
No, no.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.282
It's just that I'm taking
a step back from my cases.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.787
It just a few
hours, sis.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.209
She just needs an advocate
to sit with her during

02:07.260 --> 02:09.854
the committee, that's all.
Doesn't she know
any other lawyers?

02:09.890 --> 02:11.926
Not anybody that can
be there in an hour.
An hour from now?

02:11.960 --> 02:13.598
It's just a couple
of hours total,

02:13.630 --> 02:15.222
and having you there,

02:15.260 --> 02:17.592
the governor's wife,
would really matter.

02:17.630 --> 02:19.439
Oh, my God.

02:19.470 --> 02:20.869
You're putting on
the puppy dog face.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.458
No, I wasn't.

02:22.510 --> 02:25.934
1-1 was... I was just...
sitting waiting for your answer.

02:25.970 --> 02:28.302
See? It's just me,

02:28.340 --> 02:29.739
waiting.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.304
(knocking on glass)

02:33.850 --> 02:35.715
TREY (over speaker):
So you don't have
to show them anything?

02:35.750 --> 02:37.911
CARY: No, no, you just
identify yourself.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.282
If you're not driving a car,
you don't need all that.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.254
LENARD:
What about the skag?

02:42.290 --> 02:43.951
They can't search you?

02:43.990 --> 02:45.252
CARY: Well, how much
are we talking about here?

02:45.290 --> 02:46.928
LENARD:
Um, one and a half kilos.

02:50.230 --> 02:51.390
Damn, man!
(laughter)

02:51.430 --> 02:53.261
What do you got? Wow.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.939
Okay, no. Look, they have to
have cause to search your car.

02:55.970 --> 02:58.564
(stops recording)
(sighs)

02:58.610 --> 03:00.305
It sounds bad because

03:00.340 --> 03:02.900
you don't hear the beginning
and the end of the tape.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.578
And this is in the discovery?
DIANE:
Yes. They just sent it over.

03:05.610 --> 03:07.271
And we have two
weeks before trial.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.208
Well, maybe the judge
won't let it in.

03:09.250 --> 03:11.286
It's hearsay without Trey.
No, Forfeiture by Wrongdoing.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.379
Trey was killed in an
attempt to bury evidence.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.650
Therefore, it will
be admitted in.

03:15.690 --> 03:17.248
What about the third voice?

03:17.290 --> 03:18.655
There are three people
on that wire.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.726
Two of them are dead.
There's still one.

03:20.760 --> 03:21.954
DIANE:
Kalinda,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.298
any luck in finding him? Dante?

03:24.330 --> 03:27.663
KALINDA: Not yet. He fled after
the other two were killed.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.839
Oh, Alicia, do
you have a minute?

03:29.870 --> 03:32.236
We'll be right
back, Cary.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.005
(door opens)

03:36.040 --> 03:38.270
God, it's hard
to be the defendant.

03:38.310 --> 03:39.914
Don't ever do it.

03:39.950 --> 03:41.372
I'll try not to.

03:41.420 --> 03:43.843
Where are you, Kalinda?
You're whispering.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.881
Home.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.286
Listen, will you tell me
when you're heading out

03:48.320 --> 03:50.322
so I can come back into work?

03:50.360 --> 03:51.987
God, this is insane.

03:52.030 --> 03:54.021
I know.

03:54.060 --> 03:57.791
You know... there's one thing

03:57.830 --> 03:59.969
that they got wrong
about the wire.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.864
What?

04:00.900 --> 04:03.266
There weren't three people
on it, Cary.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.732
There were four.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.476
If this were any other client,

04:10.510 --> 04:12.512
we would be advising him
to take a plea.

04:12.550 --> 04:14.677
But it's not any other client.
We might be doing him
a disservice

04:14.720 --> 04:16.483
by not advising him
to take a plea.

04:16.520 --> 04:18.283
You're wrong.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.685
There weren't just three
of Bishop's crew on that wire.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.358
I was there, too.

04:21.390 --> 04:23.381
I need to testify.
DIANE:
No.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.829
Cary, that is not a good idea.

04:24.860 --> 04:26.396
I am the only one who can deny

04:26.430 --> 04:27.897
that that tape reflects
the full conversation.

04:27.930 --> 04:29.022
Yes, and no one
will believe you.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.493
Attorneys always
make the worst

04:30.530 --> 04:31.963
witnesses, Cary. You know that.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.332
I know I have
no other option.

04:34.370 --> 04:36.930
I don't want to testify.
I need to testify.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.672
We need to mock this.

04:40.710 --> 04:42.849
Hire someone
to cross-examine Cary,

04:42.880 --> 04:44.871
see if he holds up.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.468
ELI:
What, are you...? Alicia.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.010
I thought you weren't
taking any more cases.

04:48.050 --> 04:49.586
I'm not.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.383
I just need to hand-hold
this girl for an hour,

04:51.420 --> 04:52.717
and I'll be right in.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.557
Alicia, this is so
irresponsible. What is the case?

04:54.590 --> 04:56.080
Rape.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.826
Oh, great, because
rape is never controversial.

04:57.860 --> 04:59.999
JOHNNY: Would it change
your mind to know that
Alicia Florrick's

05:00.030 --> 05:02.498
law partner is being prosecuted
by the state's attorney?

05:02.530 --> 05:04.088
What is he being prosecuted for?

05:04.130 --> 05:06.439
For telling drug dealers
how to avoid arrest for the sale

05:06.470 --> 05:09.405
and distribution
of $1.3 million in heroin.

05:20.150 --> 05:23.608
I like
that you can't go into work.

05:23.650 --> 05:26.653
It's like
I'm keeping you hostage.

05:26.690 --> 05:29.318
(phone ringing)

05:37.630 --> 05:39.632
Hello?

05:39.670 --> 05:43.458
I know you're not alone,
so make yourself alone.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.673
Okay.

05:46.710 --> 05:48.337
What's wrong?

05:52.920 --> 05:55.115
Everything all right,
Mr. Bishop?

05:55.150 --> 05:58.517
My understanding is the Feds
are now investigating me.

05:58.550 --> 05:59.949
They're using the state's
attorney's investigation

05:59.990 --> 06:01.150
to fuel their investigation.

06:01.190 --> 06:03.420
How do you know that?

06:03.460 --> 06:06.395
The point isn't how I heard it.
The point is I heard it.

06:06.430 --> 06:07.590
What do you know about it?

06:07.630 --> 06:09.860
The Feds? Nothing.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.959
This isn't just about me,
Kalinda.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.695
This is about Cary, too.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.594
They're coming after me
through him.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.006
(wrapper rustling)
No more candy.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.608
Okay, well, let me
do some research first.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.141
Fast.

06:23.180 --> 06:24.579
Hmm.
(knocking)

06:24.610 --> 06:26.168
LANA:
KaHnda?
Hmm?

06:26.210 --> 06:28.713
(door opens)
(whispering):
I have to shower.

06:28.750 --> 06:31.139
(door closes)

06:38.630 --> 06:40.655
What's so secret?

06:40.700 --> 06:43.168
Just work.
Mm.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.623
Okay.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.207
WOMAN:
I went to a party
at the Theta house.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.471
It was supposed to start
their Thanksgiving food drive.

06:54.510 --> 06:56.944
I was only going
to bring canned stuff.

06:56.980 --> 06:59.448
Sorry, I'm not used

06:59.480 --> 07:02.074
to talking like this.

07:02.120 --> 07:05.089
But Troy was there, and
he said I should at least

07:05.120 --> 07:06.758
stick around
for a little while.

07:06.790 --> 07:09.179
I remembered all
the Red Zone stuff

07:09.220 --> 07:10.824
they told us at orientation

07:10.860 --> 07:14.023
about how many
freshman girls get, you know,

07:14.060 --> 07:16.699
assaulted in the first
few months of school

07:16.730 --> 07:18.220
from drinking too much.

07:18.270 --> 07:20.067
But I was careful.

07:20.100 --> 07:24.469
I got my own drink,
I didn't put it down.

07:25.810 --> 07:31.077
I woke up
in an upstairs bedroom... naked.

07:31.110 --> 07:34.011
(voice breaking):
I was on the floor.

07:34.050 --> 07:36.712
Troy was on the bed, asleep.

07:36.750 --> 07:39.241
I couldn't find my clothes.

07:39.290 --> 07:41.611
I couldn't...

07:43.260 --> 07:46.593
WOMAN:
Would you like to stop, Jody?

07:46.630 --> 07:48.951
No.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.131
Uh, when I looked down,

07:53.170 --> 07:55.058
he had ejaculated on me.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.965
TROY:
Jody, you're lying.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.705
That's not
what happened!

07:58.740 --> 08:00.731
This will destroy my
future. You can't just lie!

08:00.780 --> 08:03.647
Excuse me, sir.
You can't interrupt my client.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.102
Actually... Hello, Ms. Florrick.

08:05.150 --> 08:06.811
You're here
as a snlent advocate.

08:06.850 --> 08:08.545
You-you can't say anything.
Yes, but

08:08.580 --> 08:10.810
he's _the accused. It's not
his right to interrupt her.

08:10.850 --> 08:11.919
Actually, it is his right.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.258
According to the
student handbook,

08:13.290 --> 08:15.554
he can participate.

08:15.590 --> 08:17.979
It is true. He raped me.

08:18.030 --> 08:20.294
I tried to call my parents
the next day...

08:20.330 --> 08:23.561
TROY:
It was consensual.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.295
Maybe you had too much to drink
or something.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.867
I didn't have too much to drink,
and I said "No."

08:27.900 --> 08:29.561
You just didn't want to hear it.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.963
WOMAN:
How much

08:31.010 --> 08:32.534
did you have to drink, Jody?

08:32.580 --> 08:34.104
Two to three beers.

08:34.140 --> 08:36.028
TROY:
No, tequila.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.207
WOMAN:
Are you used to drinking, Jody?
Excuse me, panelists.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.969
Mrs. Florrick,
we've already warned you.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.942
You're a silen; advocate here.
es.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.288
I just need
a bathroom break.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.083
How are you?
Okay.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.588
No, not so good.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.586
I know.

08:51.630 --> 08:54.019
I'm sorry I didn't get to
introduce myself. I'm Alicia.

08:54.060 --> 08:56.051
I know.
Your-your brother said.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.295
Jody, you're doing well,
but here's the thing.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.230
I can't say anything here,

09:00.270 --> 09:03.239
but you can, so I need you
to tell them something.

09:03.270 --> 09:05.864
What?
The student
handbook--

09:05.910 --> 09:07.878
it says Troy can participate,

09:07.910 --> 09:11.038
but only with questions,
not with statements.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.843
Oh.
Yes.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.745
He's making statements.

09:14.780 --> 09:17.715
He can only do that
when he's questioned.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.911
Can you say that

09:19.960 --> 09:21.587
the next time he talks?

09:21.620 --> 09:23.178
I'll try.
Good.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.754
One more thing.

09:24.790 --> 09:26.758
What's your phone number?

09:26.800 --> 09:29.155
I didn't have tequila.
I had beer.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.668
Jody, that's not true.
I saw you drinking tequila.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.759
You were downstairs
in the kitchen.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.734
Excuse me.

09:35.770 --> 09:37.829
He can't do that.
He can't interject like that.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.599
Unfortunately, he can, Jody.

09:39.640 --> 09:43.007
No, he can only interject
with questions,

09:43.050 --> 09:44.608
not statements. . .

09:44.650 --> 09:47.073
(phone buzzing)
according to the handbook.

09:48.780 --> 09:51.647
It says so on page 38,
paragraph C.

09:55.390 --> 09:57.779
WOMAN:
Okay. Troy, please limit
your remarks to questions.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.128
JOHNNY:
I'd like to bring you back

10:00.160 --> 10:02.355
in a couple days to continue
our talk, but I just wanted

10:02.400 --> 10:04.095
to get your last impressions
of Alicia Florrick.

10:04.130 --> 10:05.768
Uh, why don't we start
with you, Sally?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.688
I don't know.
She seems entitled to me,

10:07.740 --> 10:09.093
like the world
owes her something.
(door opening)

10:09.140 --> 10:10.732
JONATHAN:
And why do you say that?

10:10.770 --> 10:11.930
Something about her.
(door closing)

10:11.970 --> 10:13.801
She just seems selfish,

10:13.840 --> 10:16.809
like everything is
about my pain, my achievements.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.045
There's a world bigger
than you, you know...

10:19.080 --> 10:20.775
Alicia, hey. Hi. You made it.
(clears throat)

10:20.820 --> 10:22.811
No, keep it running.
No, we'll
summarize for you.

10:22.850 --> 10:24.943
It didn't go well.
No, it went well.
What-what do you mean?

10:24.990 --> 10:27.254
I'm selfish.
Oh. (scoffs)

10:27.290 --> 10:30.225
That's just her. Stuck-up
bitch. Everybody liked you.

10:30.260 --> 10:33.127
Yeah, the real problem's Prady.
His brand is just as strong.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.754
ELI:
And he's announcing this week.
Truth is, he'll get a big bump

10:35.800 --> 10:38.667
from his announcement,
so, we have to step on it.
What he means is,

10:38.700 --> 10:40.133
we need _an event to coincide
With his announcement,

10:40.170 --> 10:41.797
so that he doesn't own the day.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.728
We're spitballing ideas.
Peter is willing to help,

10:43.770 --> 10:46.739
perhaps make an announcement
of his own or something.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.839
Did you tell her I started
my own firm?

10:48.880 --> 10:50.245
What?
That lady.
Did-did you tell her

10:50.280 --> 10:52.748
I started my own firm?
It wasn't handed to me.

10:52.780 --> 10:54.418
Alicia, stop it. It is one
woman in a focus group.

10:54.450 --> 10:55.815
Don't obsess.

10:55.850 --> 10:57.249
Other people nodded
when she said that.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.314
No one was nodding.

10:58.350 --> 10:59.817
Play the tape again.
No.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.749
E|__I:
We're gomg home.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.138
(door opens)

11:24.910 --> 11:26.878
(door opens, closes)

11:26.920 --> 11:30.913
You're sleeping
with a federal agent.

11:30.950 --> 11:33.180
We followed you.

11:33.220 --> 11:36.018
You left the apartment
of Deputy Agent Delaney.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.789
Yes.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.252
Why?

11:39.290 --> 11:42.862
This pre-dated anything
to do with Cary.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.492
Or you.

11:44.530 --> 11:47.135
That does not calm me.

11:47.170 --> 11:50.867
Agent Delaney is not
working on your case.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.936
The Feds are opening
another front.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.777
They're feeding information
to the state's attorney,

11:55.810 --> 11:58.449
and the SA. is feeding
information to them.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.845
And how do you know that?

11:59.880 --> 12:01.871
Because _
I'm paying attention.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.343
(sighs)

12:04.390 --> 12:07.279
This is what I need from you,
Kalinda.

12:07.320 --> 12:11.222
I need you to find out what
your girlfriend is working on.

12:11.260 --> 12:13.353
If you want me to feel calm
about you sleeping

12:13.400 --> 12:16.358
with a federal agent,
find out what case she is on.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.994
You understand?

12:21.570 --> 12:23.538
Good.

12:23.570 --> 12:26.107
Now get out.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.047
Fantastic.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.446
Where are your chairs?

13:08.480 --> 13:11.119
Oh, they, um... they
arrive tomorrow.

13:11.150 --> 13:12.549
How you feeling?

13:12.590 --> 13:14.217
How do I feel?
I feel like

13:14.260 --> 13:16.216
a... newly-minted lawyer.

13:16.260 --> 13:20.253
Ready to represent DUIs
and bail-jumpers.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.064
(chuckles)
You seem happier.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.466
I'm always happy.

13:26.530 --> 13:28.896
Do I seem entitled to you?

13:28.940 --> 13:30.931
Do I think you're entitled?

13:30.970 --> 13:32.403
No.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.931
Why? Do you, uh...
do you feel entitled?

13:34.980 --> 13:37.369
It's the focus group
on my candidacy.

13:37.410 --> 13:41.119
Someone said I seem... selfish.

13:41.150 --> 13:42.947
Do you know this person?
No.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.878
Well, then what do you care?
Come on.
Well, it's a voter.

13:44.920 --> 13:48.412
And also maybe the people who
know me are being too polite.

13:48.460 --> 13:52.578
She said I seem obsessed
with my own pain,

13:52.630 --> 13:54.291
my own achievements.

13:54.330 --> 13:56.525
Yeah, my ex-wife used to
say the same about me.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.425
Really?

13:58.470 --> 14:00.438
You don't seem
that way to me at all.

14:00.470 --> 14:01.892
Thank you.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.908
So you want to do
something about it?

14:03.940 --> 14:05.908
What? Being entitled?

14:05.940 --> 14:08.408
Yeah. Every
Wednesday, I go

14:08.440 --> 14:10.579
to St. Paul's Cathedral
on Ashland.

14:10.610 --> 14:12.578
They have a soup kitchen.

14:12.610 --> 14:14.009
Go volunteer.

14:14.050 --> 14:15.472
They always need someone.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.489
It helps you see
beyond yourself.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.385
You do that every Wednesday?

14:20.420 --> 14:21.489
Yeah.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.489
You're a good person.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.883
A saint, really.
(chuckles)

14:25.930 --> 14:27.329
You can say it.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.896
Just go.

14:28.930 --> 14:31.194
Turn up at, uh, 6:30.

14:31.230 --> 14:33.596
(exhales)
Well, I'll think about it.

14:35.940 --> 14:38.363
(indistinct chatter)

14:41.610 --> 14:43.202
I think I might have been wrong
about Alicia.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.547
Sure, she has some money,

14:44.580 --> 14:45.899
but she gives
to those less for...

14:47.250 --> 14:49.218
I'm Hank Shetty.

14:49.250 --> 14:51.616
I work as the captain
of campus police here

14:51.650 --> 14:53.208
at Polytech.
PALEY:
Jody first came

14:53.260 --> 14:54.454
to you with her accusation?

14:54.490 --> 14:55.957
Yeah. On Monday.

14:55.990 --> 14:58.083
I guess it was three days
after it happened.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.427
PALEY:
And did you notice anything
about her?

14:59.460 --> 15:01.621
Yeah, she was in control.

15:01.660 --> 15:03.298
She said she was raped
and she wanted

15:03.330 --> 15:05.594
to bring charges against Troy
over there.

15:05.630 --> 15:07.359
I asked if she wanted to have

15:07.400 --> 15:09.459
a rape exam administered.
She said no.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.162
I was surprised by that.
I asked her what had happened.

15:12.210 --> 15:13.632
She didn't know
the guy's name.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.331
She was kind of confused
about it all.

15:16.380 --> 15:18.143
(phone buzzing)
She said she had
been drinking.

15:18.180 --> 15:19.977
I think I suggested
she go to the cops,

15:20.020 --> 15:21.317
but she insisted no.

15:21.350 --> 15:22.669
Mr. Shetty,

15:22.720 --> 15:24.642
do you have any rape kits?

15:24.690 --> 15:26.544
Why don't we let Mr. Shetty
finish his statement, Jody.

15:26.590 --> 15:29.013
I thought I could ask questions
at any time.

15:29.060 --> 15:31.278
That's what it says
in the handbook.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.683
That's correct.

15:32.730 --> 15:34.493
Uh, ask your question again.

15:34.530 --> 15:38.489
Mr. Shetty, do you have any rape
kits in your campus facilities?

15:38.530 --> 15:40.964
Do I... What do you mean?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.490
(phone buzzing)

15:43.570 --> 15:45.561
You said you offered me
a rape kit,

15:45.610 --> 15:48.135
so I'm just wondering
if you had any.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.000
Any rape kits? No.

15:50.050 --> 15:53.474
So why did you offer
a rape kit?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.715
What do you mean? I asked you

15:55.750 --> 15:57.615
if you wanted
a rape kit administered.

15:57.650 --> 16:00.687
I know, but why,
if you had no rape kits?

16:00.720 --> 16:03.154
(clears throat)
Well,

16:03.190 --> 16:07.593
you know, we...
could probably get a rape kit.

16:07.630 --> 16:09.325
But you didn't want one.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.590
TROY:
Mr. Shetty,

16:11.630 --> 16:13.769
was Jody crying

16:13.800 --> 16:15.768
when she came to you?
Or upset in any way?

16:15.800 --> 16:17.734
No.
Even as she explained

16:17.770 --> 16:19.328
how she was being raped,
she didn't cry?

16:19.370 --> 16:21.679
No, and I found
that strange.

16:21.710 --> 16:24.099
I asked
that this panel hear testimony

16:24.150 --> 16:26.641
from my counselor,
Owen Cavanaugh.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.145
_ _ DIANE: _ _
So it is your opinion
that this tape,

16:31.190 --> 16:34.159
this recording, was
selectively edited?

16:34.190 --> 16:36.158
Yes. It plays the middle
of the conversation

16:36.190 --> 16:38.158
but not the beginning
and not the end.
And you think Trey,

16:38.190 --> 16:41.159
the man wearing the wire,
did this for a reason?
Yes.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.498
He was arrested by the police.
He needed to give them someone

16:43.530 --> 16:45.669
to lighten his sentence,
so he gave 'em me.
Thank you, Cary.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.691
I know how difficult
this has been.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.469
Uh, no further questions,
Your Honor.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.707
You may sit.
Prosecution have any questions?

16:51.740 --> 16:52.764
VIOLA:
I do.

16:52.810 --> 16:54.607
Hi.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.198
Cary.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.673
Um, my name is Viola Walsh.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.507
Yes, I know. Hi.

16:59.550 --> 17:00.778
I just have a
few questions

17:00.820 --> 17:02.048
for you, if you don't mind.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.388
I don't mind. Shoot.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.115
Shoot? Really?
(chuckles)

17:05.150 --> 17:06.583
I won't do that.
(chuckles)

17:06.620 --> 17:09.088
So, you worked

17:09.120 --> 17:10.724
as an assistant
state attorney

17:10.760 --> 17:12.557
before you returned
to your defense work?

17:12.590 --> 17:14.455
I did.
And you
didn't... Okay,

17:14.500 --> 17:18.220
um, let me figure out a way to
say this without offending you.

17:18.270 --> 17:21.091
You didn't work
for Lemond Bishop

17:21.140 --> 17:22.664
at the same time as
when you were an ASA?

17:22.700 --> 17:24.804
No. And don't worry
about offending me.
Okay,

17:24.840 --> 17:26.159
good. That's a relief.

17:26.210 --> 17:29.179
But you worked
for Bishop

17:29.210 --> 17:31.349
prior to joining
the ASA's office?

17:31.380 --> 17:33.610
I did. Well,
I was on his defense team.

17:33.650 --> 17:36.175
Um, yes, one of five lawyers.
So...

17:36.220 --> 17:41.214
you worked for Bishop before
and after you were an ASA?

17:41.260 --> 17:42.557
I did.

17:42.590 --> 17:44.182
Okay.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.255
So we just have to account
for 20 months

17:46.290 --> 17:48.190
that you were
at the ASA's office.
DIANE: Objection.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.118
Attorney is testifying.
I'm so sorry.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.229
I was just talking
to myself, and...

17:52.270 --> 17:54.238
and I won't
do that again.
That's okay. Take care.

17:54.270 --> 17:55.737
I wasn't gonna sustain it
anyway.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.203
Thank you.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.231
Why did you lie to your workmate

17:59.270 --> 18:01.238
and say that you never
worked for Bishop?

18:02.810 --> 18:05.278
I never lied.

18:05.310 --> 18:07.710
Oh, well,
I have a-a statement here,

18:07.750 --> 18:10.548
uh, in the discovery
from ASA Pine

18:10.590 --> 18:12.785
that when you took on
the Bishop cases,

18:12.820 --> 18:15.118
you said that you never worked
on a Bishop defense.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.457
Isn't that a lie?

18:16.490 --> 18:18.549
No.

18:18.590 --> 18:20.558
It's not? Then what is it?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.295
She was questioning my work
as a deputy,

18:22.330 --> 18:24.218
and I wanted
to stop her challenges.
Oh.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.420
So you could take Bishop's cases
from her?

18:26.470 --> 18:28.290
No, so I could stop
her challenges.

18:28.340 --> 18:29.796
But it was a lie.
No.
I mean,

18:29.840 --> 18:31.762
_ it's not a lie _
in the way that you mean it.

18:31.810 --> 18:32.902
And how do I mean it?

18:32.940 --> 18:34.476
You're trying to suggest

18:34.510 --> 18:36.432
that I lied in order
to keep working for Bishop.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.301
Okay, but you just said
it was a lie. So...

18:39.350 --> 18:41.147
was it a
lie? I-I...

18:41.180 --> 18:43.148
I mean, we seem to have
different interpretations

18:43.190 --> 18:44.248
of a lie.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.689
Objection. Argumentative.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.688
No, I'm okay with that.
Sustained.

18:47.720 --> 18:50.450
(chuckling):
Oh, I mean overruled.

18:50.490 --> 18:52.287
Thank you,
Your Honor.

18:52.330 --> 18:53.319
Cary,

18:53.360 --> 18:55.157
what is your definition
of a lie?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.656
(sighs)
Look, all I'm saying

18:56.700 --> 18:58.793
is I didn't say it
to deceive her.

18:58.830 --> 19:03.529
I mean, I didn't say it to cover
up for the fact that I was...

19:03.570 --> 19:06.209
Go ahead, Cary. Take your time.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.902
I know that you want
to tell us all the truth.

19:08.940 --> 19:11.340
Look, I wasn't working for
Bishop, and that's the truth.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.268
Mm-hmm.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.209
So how much did you make

19:16.250 --> 19:17.239
at the law firm prior
to the SA's office?

19:17.290 --> 19:19.281
$85,000 a year.

19:19.320 --> 19:20.856
And how much do you make now?
Well,
it changes.

19:20.890 --> 19:23.279
I have a draw of $350,000,

19:23.330 --> 19:25.457
and then there's
profit participation...

19:25.490 --> 19:27.458
$350,000.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.196
And how much did you make
as an SA?

19:31.470 --> 19:33.267
$38,000 a year.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.234
And yet you could keep
your apartment.

19:35.270 --> 19:36.897
Your $4,000

19:36.940 --> 19:39.909
a month apartment. That's more
than you were making every year.

19:39.940 --> 19:41.305
So how did you
pay for that?

19:41.340 --> 19:42.898
Savings.

19:42.940 --> 19:45.249
Really? Savings?

19:45.280 --> 19:48.340
I wish I could
save like that.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.587
So let's talk
about the two kilos of cocaine

19:50.620 --> 19:52.315
that you never returned
to evidence.

19:52.350 --> 19:54.284
I already went through that.
I didn't return it

19:54.320 --> 19:55.787
because it was taken.
And you realize

19:55.820 --> 19:58.948
that this is the cocaine
that allowed Bishop to go free.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.754
Once the cocaine disappeared,
Bishop got off...

20:01.800 --> 20:03.267
(clicks tongue)
scot-free.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.927
Okay, let's call a halt to this.

20:04.970 --> 20:08.269
Um... I think
we should talk, Cary.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.938
OWEN:
Jody was very clear

20:09.970 --> 20:12.336
about what happened. She came
to me the very next day.

20:12.370 --> 20:15.339
BOOTH:
Was she confused?
The campus office said

20:15.380 --> 20:16.506
she was confused
about what happened.
No.

20:16.540 --> 20:18.303
She knew

20:18.350 --> 20:19.772
who raped her.
She didn't want to go

20:19.810 --> 20:22.278
to the police, but she didn't
want to have to face him

20:22.320 --> 20:25.710
in school every day either.
(phone buzzing)

20:26.820 --> 20:28.617
I want you to know

20:28.660 --> 20:32.289
the campus cop
was composing his erection.

20:32.330 --> 20:33.820
I'm sorry, what?

20:33.860 --> 20:36.658
Yes. Huh, that doesn't make
a whole lot of sense.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.497
That almost sounds as if
it was auto-corrected.

20:38.530 --> 20:39.758
TROY:
This man is
her counselor.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.791
He has reason to lie.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.331
Again, the only interjection
allowed is a question.

20:44.370 --> 20:47.771
The campus cop was completely
wrong in his assertions.

20:47.810 --> 20:49.471
I saw her the next day,
and she knew exactly

20:49.510 --> 20:51.307
what happened.
TROY:
You failed me.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.511
You d... you don't like me.
This is unfair. I have done

20:53.550 --> 20:54.949
nothing wrong.
No, what's unfair is you talking
and not allowing us

20:54.980 --> 20:56.379
to question you.
She was drinking
too much.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.444
PALEY: All right,
all right, that's enough.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.446
That's enough.

20:59.490 --> 21:02.379
The panel is ready to deliberate
and offer its decision.

21:02.420 --> 21:03.626
ALICIA:
Excuse me.

21:03.660 --> 21:04.888
We still have witnesses.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.386
Mrs. Florrick,
we have already

21:06.430 --> 21:08.398
warned you about staying silent.

21:08.430 --> 21:10.318
Unfortunately,
Jody,

21:10.370 --> 21:12.429
there isn't enough evidence
for an expulsion.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.635
PALEY:
We want to be clear.

21:15.670 --> 21:17.865
To say there isn't
enough evidence does not mean

21:17.910 --> 21:20.538
he is innocent, Jody...
Excuse me.
There has been a complete lack

21:20.580 --> 21:22.775
of due process here,
and you have opened yourself up

21:22.810 --> 21:24.402
to a lawsuit.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.475
What?
Title IX requires

21:26.510 --> 21:28.717
due process
in campus allegations.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.742
You are subject to suit
for not supplying that.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.417
Are you suing us?

21:33.460 --> 21:36.349
Is that what you're doing, Jody?

21:42.800 --> 21:44.768
Yes.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.495
No.

21:46.530 --> 21:48.998
I mean, it's not a lie
in the way that you mean it.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.339
VIOLA:
Oh, and how do I mean it?

21:52.370 --> 21:54.577
You mean that you're trying...
you're trying to suggest

21:54.610 --> 21:57.477
that I lied in order
to keep working for Bishop.

22:04.450 --> 22:06.509
(phone rings)

22:06.550 --> 22:09.018
Mine or yours?

22:09.060 --> 22:11.381
(both phones ringing)

22:15.930 --> 22:17.591
We need to stop working so hard.

22:19.100 --> 22:21.091
LANA: Hello.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.596
Yeah.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.437
Hold on.

22:24.470 --> 22:26.335
Be right back.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.556
No.

22:41.590 --> 22:44.081
Because I said no.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.086
The same with the SA--

22:46.130 --> 22:49.099
you use him to get to Bishop.

22:49.130 --> 22:52.429
We can't.
We don't have legal cause.

22:52.470 --> 22:54.563
(water running)
Wait till the tap...

22:58.170 --> 23:00.058
JOHNNY:
Alicia Florrick is bringing a
lawsuit against Chicago Polytech

23:00.110 --> 23:02.078
on behalf of a student for
rape. Does this change anybody's

23:02.110 --> 23:06.001
vote for or against her?
Is she bringing
those charges now?

23:06.050 --> 23:07.108
Mm-hmm.
Yes. I'd be

23:07.150 --> 23:08.879
more likely to vote for her.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.480
Rape on campus
is everywhere...
What, so she's

23:11.520 --> 23:13.886
kind of_a feminist
actIVIst now?
Why does she have to be

23:13.920 --> 23:17.424
a feminist activist
to bring charges for rape?
He's not saying that.

23:17.460 --> 23:18.950
Is she running
or is she not?

23:18.990 --> 23:20.594
How fitting that
the men in the room

23:20.630 --> 23:21.995
are the ones having problems.

23:22.030 --> 23:24.692
(overlapping chatter)

23:24.730 --> 23:26.994
Your Honor, all plaintiff wants
is an emergency injunction

23:27.030 --> 23:29.737
to change the makeup
of the university panel.
Is there any reason

23:29.770 --> 23:32.068
this can't be delayed
until next week?
Not as far as

23:32.110 --> 23:33.202
we're concerned, Your Honor.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.606
(loud thump)

23:38.910 --> 23:40.172
Excuse me,
Your Honor.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.711
Uh... Sorry.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.217
(clattering, thumping)

23:45.250 --> 23:46.547
WOMAN:
Ow!

23:46.590 --> 23:48.148
Your Honor, uh...

23:48.190 --> 23:50.158
It's all right,
I have to get used to...

23:50.190 --> 23:52.658
doing this for myself.
Uh, Your Honor,

23:52.690 --> 23:54.999
I'm Louis Canning, outside
counsel for the university.

23:55.030 --> 23:56.895
Mr. Canning, yes.
Are you all right?

23:56.930 --> 23:58.693
Uh, I am. Uh...

23:58.730 --> 24:01.790
I just had an unfortunate
bout of kidney failure

24:01.840 --> 24:04.468
from my tardive dyskinesia
medication.

24:04.510 --> 24:05.932
My goodness. I'm sorry.

24:05.970 --> 24:08.131
Unfortunately, Your Honor...
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.102
Mr. Canning.
Unfortunately,
Your Honor,

24:10.140 --> 24:12.677
uh, defense has to request
that this case be expedited.

24:12.710 --> 24:14.678
Your Honor, Chicago Polytechnic
does not want

24:14.720 --> 24:17.518
the negative publicity to impact
their admissions process.

24:17.550 --> 24:19.643
That's why they're asking
this case be expedited.

24:19.690 --> 24:21.783
I wish that were the case,
Your Honor.

24:21.820 --> 24:24.789
Unfortunately, I have
my operation in a week's time

24:24.830 --> 24:26.684
and I just want to...

24:26.730 --> 24:29.096
make sure this is handled.

24:29.130 --> 24:31.690
PAR|_(S:
Mr. Canning, are
you all right?

24:31.730 --> 24:33.994
Yes, just, uh, uh...

24:34.040 --> 24:36.759
dys-dyspnea from my, uh,

24:36.800 --> 24:38.734
kidney failure. I-I know
this is an inconvenience

24:38.770 --> 24:41.170
to plaintiff's attorney,
and-and I am sorry.

24:41.210 --> 24:43.576
I also wish it didn't
inconvenience the court.

24:43.610 --> 24:45.168
Oh, stop it,
Mr. Canning, it's...

24:45.210 --> 24:47.041
no inconvenience at all.

24:47.080 --> 24:50.982
We'll start hearing testimony on
your motion to dismiss tomorrow.

24:51.020 --> 24:52.214
(gavelbangs)

24:52.250 --> 24:54.684
Was any of that true in there?

24:54.720 --> 24:56.654
I've missed you, Alicia.

24:56.690 --> 24:57.952
You're fun.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.150
Are you dying?

24:59.190 --> 25:00.748
Well, everybody's dying.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.825
Are you dying now?

25:02.860 --> 25:04.896
No, I'm having a
kidney transplant.

25:04.930 --> 25:06.591
That's it.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.938
See you tomorrow.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.728
He's going in
for a kidney transplant,

25:14.780 --> 25:16.270
and she thinks he's lying.

25:16.310 --> 25:19.279
She's not just selfish,
she's paranoi...

25:27.790 --> 25:29.052
Hey.

25:29.090 --> 25:31.058
Wow, look at you.

25:31.090 --> 25:32.853
Best-dressed in
the soup kitchen.

25:32.890 --> 25:34.824
I just came from court.

25:34.860 --> 25:35.952
You dress down well.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.298
Oh, yeah, you know,
I have a consultant.

25:38.330 --> 25:42.096
So... the last one who shows

25:42.140 --> 25:43.937
gets the pots.

25:43.970 --> 25:46.302
ALICIA:
Oh, this is just like home.

25:46.340 --> 25:48.877
But less entitled.
Much less.

25:48.910 --> 25:51.299
I can feel _the selfishness
melting away.
(chuckles)

25:53.880 --> 25:55.871
(phone rings)

25:57.850 --> 25:59.112
Hi, Eli.

25:59.150 --> 26:00.856
We just found out
from the Confetti Brothers

26:00.890 --> 26:02.152
where Prady is announcing.

26:02.190 --> 26:03.851
Uh, Eli, I'm busy.

26:03.890 --> 26:06.256
Can I try to figure out
what you're saying another time?

26:06.290 --> 26:08.349
The Confetti Brothers
are a duo out of Wisconsin

26:08.400 --> 26:10.994
who control all the confetti
for political functions.

26:11.030 --> 26:13.931
They told us Prady is announcing
at Bonaventure tomorrow night.

26:13.970 --> 26:15.858
Okay, those words made sense.
Can I go now?

26:15.900 --> 26:17.868
What are you doing?
Scrubbing a pot.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.866
Yes, I can see why
you have to go.

26:19.910 --> 26:21.775
We have a plan for Peter
to meet you in a Bonaventure

26:21.810 --> 26:23.903
hotel suite and for
photographers to see you

26:23.950 --> 26:24.871
coming out.

26:24.910 --> 26:26.241
You can't be serious.
Yeah,

26:26.280 --> 26:27.941
Peter's already on board.

26:27.980 --> 26:29.015
That'll become the story,

26:29.050 --> 26:30.745
not Prady's announcement.

26:30.790 --> 26:33.657
Okay. I'm going now, Eli. Bye.

26:54.140 --> 26:56.700
(computer pings)

27:13.230 --> 27:15.858
(phone rings)

27:15.900 --> 27:17.993
Better look at this.

27:18.030 --> 27:19.998
Hello.

27:20.030 --> 27:21.964
Were you at the St. Paul's
Cathedral last night?
Yeah,

27:22.000 --> 27:25.163
why?
There is a photo of you
scrubbing an already-clean pot

27:25.210 --> 27:27.735
and talking on the phone.
Oh, my God. Who took it?

27:27.780 --> 27:29.031
I don't know. A tracker.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.741
Why were you scrubbing
an already-clean pot?

27:30.780 --> 27:32.304
It wasn't clean.

27:32.350 --> 27:33.874
I cleaned it.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.377
Does it say it was clean?
ELI: It says it was clean.

27:36.420 --> 27:38.718
And why are you dressed like
you're going to a dinner party?
I wasn't.

27:38.750 --> 27:41.412
It was after work. And I was on
the phone with you. You called

27:41.460 --> 27:43.155
me.
Alicia, this is a disaster.

27:43.190 --> 27:45.829
You can't do photo ops
like this on your own.

27:45.860 --> 27:48.749
It wasn't a photo op.
1-1 was just helping out.
Well, you can't do that.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.324
There are people out there
trying to screw you.

27:50.360 --> 27:52.396
Oh, my God, does
it say it was clean?
You need to get in here.

27:52.430 --> 27:53.988
We need to strategize.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.235
No, I have to go to court.

27:56.270 --> 27:58.704
I thought you delayed that.
No, I tried

27:58.740 --> 28:01.106
to delay it.
Alicia, I take my job seriously.

28:01.140 --> 28:03.028
You need to take it
seriously, too.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.401
(sighs)

28:05.450 --> 28:06.906
Oh, my God,

28:06.950 --> 28:08.941
They're just
making this stuff up.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.982
For a politician's wife,
she's kind of phony.

28:11.020 --> 28:12.817
REGGIE:
It's like they're not real to
her-- the homeless people.

28:12.850 --> 28:14.818
LARRY:
Yeah. like
animals in a cage.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.158
SALLY:
She just went to that
soup kitchen to show off.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.389
VIOLA:
Okay, good, I think

28:27.430 --> 28:29.990
we've covered that thoroughly.
Let's move on to the wire.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.302
The recording
of your wrongdoing.

28:31.340 --> 28:33.433
My alleged wrongdoing.
Your alleged

28:33.470 --> 28:36.132
wrongdoing. Now, the tape
starts with you joking

28:36.180 --> 28:39.069
about women, is that right?
No, that is not how it started.

28:39.110 --> 28:41.943
That's when the CI.
decided to turn on the wire.

28:41.980 --> 28:45.017
Are you saying that
the wire was edited?
No. I'm saying the CI.

28:45.050 --> 28:47.439
edited it by choosing
when to turn it on and off.

28:47.490 --> 28:49.913
I talk much longer
than the wire.
You did?

28:49.960 --> 28:52.178
Because we only hear the end
of your joke about Beyonc.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.527
So what did you say
about Beyonc

28:53.560 --> 28:55.528
before the tape
started rolling?

28:55.560 --> 28:57.050
How is this relevant?
Cary.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.169
No, seriously. How is my joking

28:58.200 --> 28:59.497
about Beyonc relevant?

28:59.530 --> 29:00.963
Wow. Okay, are we

29:01.000 --> 29:02.763
taking a break
from questioning?

29:02.800 --> 29:04.358
Let me talk to Cary
for a second.
I'm just

29:04.410 --> 29:06.207
asking a question
and what I don't get

29:06.240 --> 29:07.969
is why you're not
objecting more.
I'm not objecting

29:08.010 --> 29:10.331
more because these
are softballs and if I object

29:10.380 --> 29:12.871
it'll look like we're
hiding something.
Well, I disagree.

29:12.910 --> 29:14.013
Okay, that's it.

29:14.050 --> 29:15.074
Let's take a break.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.912
We'll, uh, pay
for one more session.

29:18.950 --> 29:21.282
Okay. When's his trial?
Two weeks.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.880
All right, Diane, we've had
our issues in the past.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.181
That's why you've hired me.

29:25.230 --> 29:27.926
But I have to tell you,
he is a bad witness.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.019
If I'm on the jury, he's
going away for 15 years.

29:30.060 --> 29:33.268
I know. Thanks.

29:33.300 --> 29:35.063
Anytime.

29:40.270 --> 29:41.976
Cary,

29:42.010 --> 29:43.944
whatever you have to do,
whoever you have to

29:43.980 --> 29:45.800
talk to, get your head
in the game.

29:45.850 --> 29:47.977
You are 14 days away from
spending a decade in prison.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.271
Do you understand?

29:49.320 --> 29:52.380
I understand
that I will be fine.

29:52.420 --> 29:54.581
You need to protect me
more on the stand.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.815
Watch the tape.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.798
(lock clicking)

30:18.210 --> 30:20.178
Kalinda, close
the door. It's me.

30:20.210 --> 30:21.518
Cary.

30:27.450 --> 30:29.418
Cary, this is a mistake.

30:29.460 --> 30:31.883
Do you want
to go back to jail?
No, I don't.

30:31.930 --> 30:33.352
Then stop screwing around.

30:33.390 --> 30:35.119
30 feet between us, Cary.
30 feet.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.627
You cannot be here.
No one

30:36.660 --> 30:38.491
saw me enter.
And how do you know that?

30:38.530 --> 30:41.090
Castro wants you in prison.
He could have cops outside.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.994
Why do you lie to me?

30:43.040 --> 30:45.861
Cary, take this seriously.
I am.

30:45.910 --> 30:48.470
When I call you, you say
you're home, but you're not.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.107
How do you know that?

30:52.150 --> 30:54.072
Because you're with this Fed.

31:00.090 --> 31:02.058
What are you doing?

31:02.090 --> 31:04.251
Well, you came here to bang me,
so come on, let's go.

31:04.290 --> 31:06.929
Just...

31:06.960 --> 31:08.928
Just act like you care.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.463
For 14 days, act like I
mean something to you.
You do.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.991
Well, then show me and
stop going to her.

31:16.170 --> 31:19.059
Cary, come on, that's
not what this is all about.

31:19.110 --> 31:21.305
We don't do that to each other.
I can't think about
anything else.

31:21.340 --> 31:24.104
I need to save myself,
and all I do

31:24.150 --> 31:26.971
is picture you in bed with her.
Cary, we're not married.
We're not even going steady.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.272
But you mean
something to me.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.413
Yes, I know I'm supposed
to be a good sport,

31:30.450 --> 31:32.315
but I don't want
to be with anyone else.

31:36.420 --> 31:38.888
I do.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.397
Okay, well, that solves that.

31:43.430 --> 31:46.263
Thank you and go to hell.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.189
(door opens)
Cary, wait.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.231
Let me check
that nobody's outsi...

32:02.720 --> 32:06.212
BOOTH: Jody had a fair hearing.
Most disciplinary sessions last

32:06.250 --> 32:07.410
less than an hour.
CANNING: Really?

32:07.450 --> 32:09.179
And how long
did Jody's session last?

32:09.220 --> 32:11.256
Five hours over two days.

32:11.290 --> 32:13.155
My goodness. That sounds
like due process to me.

32:13.190 --> 32:16.227
Objection. Counselor
is testifying. Poorly, too.

32:16.260 --> 32:17.454
PARKS:
Do you have anything

32:17.500 --> 32:20.060
else to say,
Mr. Canning?

32:20.100 --> 32:22.739
Uh, no, I'll just rephrase.
IfI may.

32:22.770 --> 32:25.432
Um, the student
judiciary committee

32:25.470 --> 32:27.267
has a lot of regulations, right?
Yes.

32:27.310 --> 32:29.574
We have a detailed manual.
That would be

32:29.610 --> 32:31.999
this heaw thing
right here, right?

32:32.050 --> 32:33.472
That's right. 250 pages.

32:33.510 --> 32:36.343
Uh, it lays out all the rules.
And is one of the rules

32:36.380 --> 32:38.245
that a-a complaining witness
like Ms. Milam

32:38.290 --> 32:40.019
is entitled
to a silent advocate

32:40.050 --> 32:41.312
as long as the person doesn't

32:41.360 --> 32:43.419
interfere with the participants?

32:43.460 --> 32:45.485
That's correct.
Did Mrs. Florrick
interfere with the proceedings?

32:45.530 --> 32:48.419
Objection.
I am not on trial here.

32:48.460 --> 32:50.655
One second.

32:52.570 --> 32:54.492
Can you tell us
the level of training

32:54.540 --> 32:56.292
you received
to sit on this panel?
We all

32:56.340 --> 32:59.264
attended a weekend seminar.
An entire weekend?

32:59.310 --> 33:00.504
Objection.
Sustained.

33:00.540 --> 33:01.609
We were also provided

33:03.140 --> 33:04.539
And were these training videos

33:04.580 --> 33:06.377
specific to sexual assault?

33:06.410 --> 33:09.538
No.
Were you appointed
to this panel, Ms. Booth?

33:09.580 --> 33:13.539
No, I volunteered.
Have you volunteered
to get any additional training

33:13.590 --> 33:16.184
pursuant
to sexual assault?
It wasn't reqUIred.

33:16.220 --> 33:18.029
No more questions.

33:18.060 --> 33:20.551
Have you ever served
on a jury?
Yes. Twice.

33:20.590 --> 33:22.558
A murder trial and
an embezzlement case.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.261
Did you have any experience
in either of those things?

33:24.300 --> 33:26.427
No.
Yet you and your
fellow jurors

33:26.470 --> 33:28.563
were able to reach a verdict
both times?

33:28.600 --> 33:30.739
Yes.
Thank you.
I have no further questions.

33:30.770 --> 33:32.101
ALICIA:
Ms. Booth,

33:32.140 --> 33:34.074
at the start
of both trials,

33:34.110 --> 33:36.135
did you receive instruction
from the judge?

33:36.180 --> 33:37.704
Yes.
And were
both sides able

33:37.740 --> 33:39.276
to put up expert witnesses?

33:39.310 --> 33:41.574
Yes.
Prior to _
the sexual assault hearing

33:41.620 --> 33:46.319
for Jody Milam, did you get
any direction or instruction?

33:46.350 --> 33:48.215
No.
Did you

33:48.260 --> 33:50.478
call upon any
expert witnesses

33:50.520 --> 33:52.488
to clarify any medical findings?

33:52.530 --> 33:54.452
No.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.626
(laughs softly)

33:55.660 --> 33:57.628
No further questions.

34:10.810 --> 34:13.199
VIOLA (on video):
Let's move on to the wire, the
recording of your wrongdoing.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.241
CARY:
My alleged wrongdoing.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.748
VIOLA:
Okay, your alleged wrongdoing.

34:17.780 --> 34:19.179
Now, the tape starts...

34:19.220 --> 34:21.313
(turns off video)

34:21.360 --> 34:22.315
How are you?

34:22.360 --> 34:23.782
Notgood.

34:23.820 --> 34:25.219
I know; I saw it.

34:25.260 --> 34:27.251
Lawyers make
the worst witnesses.

34:27.290 --> 34:28.689
How about you?

34:28.730 --> 34:31.164
I'm Marie Antoinette.
(light laugh)

34:31.200 --> 34:32.599
Good for you.

34:37.300 --> 34:39.507
I know you're not asking

34:39.540 --> 34:41.701
for advice,
but I'm giving it anyway.

34:41.740 --> 34:43.628
It's an injustice
what's happening to you,

34:43.680 --> 34:45.841
but you're lost
in the indignation
and the anger.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.245
You can't see

34:47.280 --> 34:49.419
past them,
and neither will a jury

34:49.450 --> 34:51.611
if you don't get it
under control.

34:51.650 --> 34:54.357
Give the jury
a chance to find

34:54.390 --> 34:56.551
the injustice themselves.

34:56.590 --> 34:59.650
Coming off you, it reads like...

35:01.230 --> 35:03.596
(sighs):
...entitlement.

35:03.630 --> 35:05.791
(chuckles):
Yeah.

35:07.700 --> 35:09.793
Thank you.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.831
You'll be great.

35:18.180 --> 35:21.513
Have you finished with your
good works, Mrs. Florrick?

35:21.550 --> 35:23.518
That pot was dirty, Eli.

35:23.550 --> 35:25.643
I spent 15 minutes scrubbing...
Okay, sit down.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.646
I just spent

35:27.690 --> 35:30.716
ten minutes giving
someone else advice.

35:31.790 --> 35:33.655
Don't ever do
this again.

35:33.690 --> 35:35.658
Eli, I went to the soup kitchen

35:35.700 --> 35:38.726
because I'm sick
of thinking about myself.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.726
Mm-hmm. Then think about me.

35:40.770 --> 35:42.692
Some voters_ think
you're entitled.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.833
Some voters don't know you yet.

35:44.870 --> 35:47.668
You want to do some good?
We make a photo op.

35:47.710 --> 35:50.929
That's not doing a good deed.
Stop acting like
this is about you

35:50.980 --> 35:53.346
becoming a better person--
it's about you appearing

35:53.380 --> 35:54.711
like you're a better person.

35:54.750 --> 35:56.672
That's what the
voters respect--

35:56.720 --> 35:58.813
the image of it.

35:58.850 --> 36:00.488
Oh, you think this
is counterintuitive?

36:00.520 --> 36:01.851
It is.
That's why you're

36:01.890 --> 36:03.619
bad at this
and I'm good.

36:03.660 --> 36:05.457
You think reporters want
something original?

36:05.490 --> 36:07.549
They don't. They want
a pre-chewed story.

36:07.590 --> 36:09.751
They want to be forced
into a roped-off area

36:09.800 --> 36:10.858
to get the best picture.

36:10.900 --> 36:12.788
They want me to
feed them a line.

36:12.830 --> 36:14.798
Let me do my
job, Alicia.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.262
I'm good at it.

36:16.300 --> 36:18.439
And if you really want
to be a good person,

36:18.470 --> 36:20.631
I'll tell you where
to send the check.

36:20.670 --> 36:22.774
Are we understanding
each other?

36:32.690 --> 36:33.884
You ready, Mr. Agos?

36:33.920 --> 36:35.808
I am. Thank you.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.953
Okay. According
to your testimony,

36:37.990 --> 36:40.481
your words on that tape
were tantamount

36:40.530 --> 36:42.851
to you just hanging
with the cool kids?

36:42.900 --> 36:44.720
Shooting the breeze,
killing time?

36:44.770 --> 36:46.692
Yes.

36:46.730 --> 36:48.493
Mm.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.759
And you don't view your
actions as criminal?

36:51.810 --> 36:53.801
No.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.637
Or ignorance of
such severity

36:55.680 --> 36:57.602
that it might as
well be criminal?

36:57.640 --> 36:58.777
No.

36:58.810 --> 37:00.471
(exhales)

37:00.510 --> 37:02.649
Would you care
to elaborate?

37:06.290 --> 37:07.780
No.

37:09.890 --> 37:11.448
(smacks lips)

37:11.490 --> 37:13.879
(phone rings)

37:13.930 --> 37:16.558
Hi. I'm heading into court.
Anything?

37:16.600 --> 37:19.398
Yep. I was looking
for more girls Troy assaulted.

37:19.430 --> 37:21.933
I found something much better--
more rapists.

37:21.970 --> 37:22.891
What?

37:22.940 --> 37:24.305
There's a rape wall on campus.

37:24.340 --> 37:25.534
I'm not following.

37:25.570 --> 37:26.867
When a girl gets
sexually violated,

37:26.910 --> 37:29.777
she puts up the attacker's name
on the wall.

37:29.810 --> 37:33.268
Okay. But I don't think there's
enough time for a class action.

37:33.310 --> 37:35.039
No. The university
is in the process

37:35.080 --> 37:36.843
of painting over the wall.

37:37.980 --> 37:40.585
Can you get me photos?

37:40.620 --> 37:41.882
CANNING:
Judge, not only is this

37:41.920 --> 37:45.629
so-called "rape wall"
inflammatory,

37:45.660 --> 37:47.423
it's totally irrelevant.
He's right, Mrs. Florrick.

37:47.460 --> 37:49.826
These names have nothing to do
with whether the university

37:49.860 --> 37:51.964
denied your client
due process.
ALICIA:
I agree, Your Honor.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.798
Which is why we ask for leave
to amend the complaint.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.933
_A class action _
against the univerSIty

37:56.970 --> 37:59.404
for creating an
unsafe environment.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.805
Mr. Canning?

38:00.840 --> 38:02.671
One-one second.

38:02.710 --> 38:03.972
(inhales)

38:09.520 --> 38:10.942
Mr. Bishop.

38:10.980 --> 38:12.880
Hello.

38:14.050 --> 38:15.881
What did you find out?

38:15.920 --> 38:17.478
From Agent Delaney?

38:17.520 --> 38:18.851
What is she
working on?

38:18.890 --> 38:20.824
Am I in danger or not?

38:20.860 --> 38:22.521
You're not.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.997
Are you sure?

38:27.030 --> 38:30.488
What is she working on?
White-collar crime.

38:30.540 --> 38:32.531
I don't believe you.

38:37.810 --> 38:39.846
I need you to do
something for me.

38:39.880 --> 38:41.871
Next time you see
Ms. Delaney,

38:41.920 --> 38:44.616
I want you to put
this in her wallet.

38:50.790 --> 38:52.451
Why?

38:52.490 --> 38:54.549
Because I'm asking.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.925
Can I ask what it is?

39:00.970 --> 39:01.937
No.

39:01.970 --> 39:05.098
Look, Mr. Bishop,
I'm telling you the truth.

39:05.140 --> 39:07.005
She's not focusing on you.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.476
Then put that in her wallet,
and we'll be good.

39:20.820 --> 39:23.482
CANNING: I apprised the
university of the progress
of these proceedings,

39:23.520 --> 39:25.021
and they gave me
this statement.

39:25.060 --> 39:26.823
Would you like
to read it?

39:26.860 --> 39:28.919
"A random search of Troy
Anthony's dorm room

39:28.960 --> 39:31.861
(chuckles):
uncovered a substantial
quantity of marijuana."

39:31.900 --> 39:33.697
Are you kidding me?
We were surprised.

39:33.730 --> 39:35.595
He's such a good kid.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.858
Keep reading.
"This, of course,
is a gross violation

39:37.900 --> 39:39.868
of the code of conduct."

39:39.910 --> 39:41.707
A random search, huh?
Yes.

39:41.740 --> 39:44.447
It happens all the time.
_ "Pu_rsuan_t _
to univer5ity gUIdelines,

39:44.480 --> 39:46.607
"Troy Anthony...

39:46.650 --> 39:49.574
has been expelled,
effective immediately."

39:49.620 --> 39:52.885
CANNING:
So you see there's
no reason for your...

39:52.920 --> 39:55.616
lawsuit against Chicago
Polytech to proceed.
Actually,

39:55.660 --> 39:58.185
there are 60 reasons--
that's how many names
are on the rape wall.

39:58.220 --> 40:00.927
You're running scared.
We're just getting started.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.825
No.

40:04.230 --> 40:06.198
Jody, this is what you wanted.

40:06.230 --> 40:08.630
Troy's... gone from your life.

40:09.770 --> 40:11.761
I'm done.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.984
When's your operation?

40:26.020 --> 40:28.113
I don't know.

40:28.150 --> 40:30.584
Haven't found a kidney.

40:30.620 --> 40:32.724
Can I do anything?

40:32.760 --> 40:34.819
Yes.

40:34.860 --> 40:36.725
IfI die...

40:36.760 --> 40:38.625
Are you... going to die?

40:38.670 --> 40:40.490
I don't know.

40:40.530 --> 40:44.534
I'd like for you
to visit my... wife.

40:44.570 --> 40:46.936
She likes you, and, um...

40:46.970 --> 40:49.768
this thing has
been hard on her.

40:50.780 --> 40:52.748
I will.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.688
ALICIA:
Here you go.

40:58.720 --> 41:01.587
Oh, you need some silverware.

41:01.620 --> 41:03.212
Here you are.
Thank you.

41:03.260 --> 41:06.058
(camera shutters clicking)

41:06.090 --> 41:08.729
A_LICIA:
Hi, Ann.

41:08.760 --> 41:09.749
It's good to see you again.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.097
If you need help

41:11.130 --> 41:12.859
with your
housing application later,

41:12.900 --> 41:14.219
I'll have time.

41:14.270 --> 41:16.636
I'd be happy to help.

41:19.770 --> 41:22.705
Come on, Ann,
let's, uh, get you some salad.

41:22.740 --> 41:24.742
NEWSMAN: The governor's wife
spent time today

41:24.780 --> 41:26.577
at St. Paul's Cathedral's
food kitchen--

41:26.610 --> 41:28.578
and she was quite a hit.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.747
In related news, incumbent
State's Attorney James Castro

41:30.780 --> 41:32.714
announced today he was
withdrawing from the race--

41:32.750 --> 41:35.014
this as newsman Frank Prady
announced he would be...

41:35.060 --> 41:36.584
Well, thanks again, everyone,

41:36.620 --> 41:37.917
for your patience
these last few days.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.780
I do want to ask you
one more time

41:39.830 --> 41:41.559
about your feelings
toward Alicia Florrick.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.249
Look, I've been
all over the place about her,

41:43.300 --> 41:45.268
and I'm still not thrilled
that she's with her husband,

41:45.300 --> 41:47.768
but... I like her.

41:47.800 --> 41:51.190
(over speaker):
I think she seems to care.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.935
Not bad, huh?

41:52.970 --> 41:54.699
Not bad.

41:54.740 --> 41:57.106
Now we just have
to beat Prady.

41:57.140 --> 41:59.802
Tell me what to do.

42:11.860 --> 42:14.624
You're not leaving, are you?

42:16.160 --> 42:17.718
No.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.022
Mm.

42:20.230 --> 42:22.630
(groans)
That's good.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.634
*

42:35.350 --> 42:37.545
(door closes)

42:54.870 --> 42:58.033
*

43:08.720 --> 43:10.938
(whispers):
Damn it.
