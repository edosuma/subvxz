WEBVTT

00:04.118 --> 00:06.398
E. R.

00:06.399 --> 00:07.402
Previously on E. R.

00:07.403 --> 00:12.221
There's a couple out there who
desperately want to raise a child.

00:13.793 --> 00:15.504
You turned me in?

00:15.505 --> 00:17.981
There's a guy from the medical board
here, questioning my competency.

00:17.982 --> 00:19.993
I hope you don't mind me
spending time with John.

00:20.094 --> 00:21.673
Why would I?

00:22.342 --> 00:24.078
- Well, he told me.
- Told you what?

00:24.079 --> 00:25.079
About you and him.

00:25.963 --> 00:27.202
I care about you.

00:27.230 --> 00:31.276
I'm not interested
in adopting a lifestyle.

00:31.311 --> 00:33.191
Wow, I can't believe
you just said that.

00:33.192 --> 00:34.192
I love you.

00:34.293 --> 00:37.787
I was hoping you'd give me the joy
and honor...

00:37.888 --> 00:39.809
of being your husband.

00:39.810 --> 00:40.810
Yes.

00:42.728 --> 00:45.480
E. R. 7x18 "APRIL SHOWERS"

00:46.732 --> 00:48.808
- Damn it!
- Oh, Elizabeth!

00:48.984 --> 00:52.732
Six months ago this wedding seemed
like a good idea.

00:52.904 --> 00:55.062
Look at me! What the hell
was I thinking?

00:55.240 --> 00:57.066
You look beautiful.

00:57.241 --> 00:58.404
Oh, please!

00:58.576 --> 00:59.904
What could be more perfect?

01:00.077 --> 01:03.410
You're marrying the man that you love
while carrying his child.

01:03.580 --> 01:07.412
Yes. This love child also comes with
an extra 40 pounds and hemorrhoids.

01:07.584 --> 01:09.742
There are some things
I don't need to know.

01:09.919 --> 01:11.663
Where's Mark?

01:11.838 --> 01:15.752
Why don't you sit down
and have some tea?

01:15.925 --> 01:18.676
What? So I can pee every
two minutes instead of every 10?

01:18.844 --> 01:20.172
Elizabeth, listen to me.

01:20.929 --> 01:24.547
You need to stop,
take a moment. Relax.

01:24.849 --> 01:27.340
Enjoy your day.

01:27.519 --> 01:29.511
You're being awfully nice to me.

01:30.521 --> 01:32.348
It only makes me more nervous.

01:33.524 --> 01:35.397
I'll get it.

01:37.945 --> 01:39.355
It is not raining.

01:39.529 --> 01:40.692
- Hello?
- No. No.

01:40.864 --> 01:42.737
A little mist. I'm sure it'll blow over.

01:43.616 --> 01:45.905
Have you seen my wallet?
It's not in the car.

01:46.786 --> 01:49.455
- No.
- Damn it. Must be in my locker at work.

01:49.622 --> 01:53.453
Everything will be fine, dear.
Well, let me get your father.

01:53.625 --> 01:54.788
It's Rachel.

01:54.960 --> 01:56.751
Hey, Rach.

01:57.837 --> 01:58.868
Slow down.

01:59.047 --> 02:00.375
What's wrong?

02:00.548 --> 02:01.711
She missed her flight.

02:02.091 --> 02:04.546
- No.
- I'm sure she can get another one.

02:05.052 --> 02:07.757
But perhaps she shouldn't have
left it until today.

02:08.722 --> 02:11.011
She was starring in her school play
last night.

02:11.183 --> 02:13.508
- That's why they invented understudies.
- Mother!

02:14.144 --> 02:15.554
- All I said was that-
- Don't!

02:15.979 --> 02:17.223
Everything's okay.

02:17.397 --> 02:20.730
She's switching airlines,
and she's gonna fly into Midway.

02:21.066 --> 02:24.482
Give me time to grab my wallet.
Then I can swing by and pick her up.

02:24.653 --> 02:26.942
Hey, it's no big deal.

02:27.572 --> 02:30.822
Why does it always have to get
so complicated just at the last minute?

02:30.992 --> 02:34.242
Everything is gonna go like clockwork.

02:34.412 --> 02:37.329
In a few hours we're gonna be
surrounded by friends...

02:37.498 --> 02:39.905
...and people we love, and your mother.

02:41.335 --> 02:46.755
And the three of us are going
to be married.

02:49.133 --> 02:50.758
- You said you were covered.
- No.

02:50.927 --> 02:54.840
- You said Malucci was covering for you.
- I said he might cover my last few hours.

02:55.014 --> 02:56.840
- Well, is he or isn't he?
- I don't know.

02:57.015 --> 02:58.178
When will you find out?

02:58.350 --> 03:01.600
- When he gets here.
- That's great. Malucci's reliable.

03:01.770 --> 03:04.936
I have my dress in the locker.
If I'm ready when it's time, I'll go.

03:05.106 --> 03:07.182
If not, you can go stag.

03:07.358 --> 03:09.434
- Does Malucci have a cell phone?
- Why?

03:09.610 --> 03:11.935
- Why don't we call him?
- I'm not going to call him.

03:12.112 --> 03:13.939
Open radius fracture on call for the O.R.

03:14.114 --> 03:17.946
Gastroenteritis in Seven
is being rehydrated.

03:18.118 --> 03:19.528
What about the renal colic?

03:19.702 --> 03:22.371
Discharged. If you need to reach me,
I'll be at my hotel.

03:22.538 --> 03:24.032
Dr. Weaver, Connie on four.

03:24.206 --> 03:27.124
Okay. Tell her she can speak
with Dr. Kovac when she gets in.

03:27.292 --> 03:30.459
- Says she has a fever.
- Too late. Her co-conspirators...

03:30.629 --> 03:33.464
- ... used the last of the back-up registries.
- Co-conspirators?

03:33.631 --> 03:36.039
The nurses are calling in sick
to go to the wedding.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.877
Says she has a temperature of 102.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.887
Give it to me. Connie, I need you here.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.380
Somebody should look
at the guy in Curtain Three.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.593
Accidentally used Bengay instead
of Preparation H.

03:46.768 --> 03:47.799
How are you feeling?

03:47.978 --> 03:49.887
Like a Snuffleupagus on Benadryl.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.806
Go home.
Take a nap before the wedding.

03:51.981 --> 03:55.065
- We're already down a few nurses.
- We're slow. We'll float someone.

03:55.234 --> 03:58.401
Come on. I saw you yesterday trying
to change your shift.

03:58.570 --> 04:00.065
I'll wait until she goes home.

04:00.239 --> 04:03.821
She won't see you there. She is missing
the wedding for a billing conference.

04:03.992 --> 04:05.155
She wasn't invited.

04:05.327 --> 04:08.493
Okay, fine. Go ahead.
But I want a note from a doctor.

04:08.663 --> 04:12.992
And if you show up in any
of the wedding pictures, you're fired.

04:14.001 --> 04:15.543
Go.

04:16.211 --> 04:19.128
E.R.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:13.429 --> 05:15.386
Hey, Mark, shouldn't you be...?

05:15.556 --> 05:18.889
Forgot my wallet. You going someplace?

05:19.059 --> 05:22.143
Yeah. Reimbursement Strategies
Conference.

05:22.312 --> 05:24.803
- The one in Las Vegas.
- Yeah, I missed it last year.

05:24.981 --> 05:28.397
I thought it would be the best way
to put a dent in our deficit.

05:28.568 --> 05:32.067
- Well, play a hand of blackjack for me.
- Sure.

05:32.238 --> 05:33.352
Hey, Mark.

05:33.531 --> 05:36.104
I want you to know how happy
I am for you and Elizabeth.

05:36.575 --> 05:38.117
Thanks.

05:42.997 --> 05:45.073
Dr. Greene, you're here?
That's devotion.

05:45.249 --> 05:46.660
You never saw me.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.162
Okay. Got it.

05:48.335 --> 05:52.582
Jing-Mei, that pilonidal cyst
in Three isn't going anywhere.

05:52.756 --> 05:56.753
New rule: Anything that involves pus
waits until after lunch.

05:56.926 --> 05:58.670
Can you get Mr. Tuttle a sandwich?

05:58.845 --> 06:02.427
The unborn twin inside
of his stomach is hungry.

06:02.598 --> 06:04.591
Okay. Can you wait over there, please?

06:04.767 --> 06:07.637
County base, this is Rescue 43.

06:08.353 --> 06:09.931
County base, go ahead on Bravo One.

06:10.105 --> 06:11.682
We 're at the site of an accident.

06:11.857 --> 06:13.315
So are you taking the cheerleader?

06:13.483 --> 06:14.514
What?

06:14.692 --> 06:15.855
To the wedding.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.604
Or are they carding?

06:17.779 --> 06:19.023
Et tu, Deb?

06:19.196 --> 06:21.734
She gives new meaning
to the term "girlfriend. "

06:21.907 --> 06:22.938
Who are you taking?

06:23.117 --> 06:25.524
I'm not. Someone has
to hold down the fort.

06:25.702 --> 06:27.611
- Not invited?
- Amira, find Luka now.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.531
- What?
- Prison van over an embankment.

06:29.706 --> 06:31.532
They want to know how
many we can take.

06:31.708 --> 06:33.830
Three major, 10 minor.

06:34.710 --> 06:36.786
- Tell them.
- I should ask Luka.

06:38.047 --> 06:40.039
- Three major, 10 minor.
- Are you sure?

06:40.215 --> 06:43.714
This is County base. We can take a
total of three major, 10 minor. Over.

06:43.885 --> 06:46.127
Got it. Rescue 43 out.

06:47.305 --> 06:50.056
Hold on! Hold on! Wait!

06:50.224 --> 06:51.967
- That's my van.
- You can't read?

06:52.143 --> 06:54.135
- I'm a doctor here.
- You should know better.

06:54.311 --> 06:56.268
I'm getting married today.
Give me a break.

06:56.438 --> 06:58.395
Congratulations.

06:58.565 --> 07:01.234
Let me get my tux out!

07:04.070 --> 07:06.525
- Dr. Greene, what are you doing?
- He towed my van!

07:06.697 --> 07:08.489
Aren't you supposed
to be getting ready?

07:08.657 --> 07:10.697
I came to get my wallet,
and he towed my van.

07:10.868 --> 07:13.405
- You want to take my car?
- Continue CPR. Keep bagging.

07:13.578 --> 07:16.662
- This from the prison van?
- Yeah. The driver, blunt chest trauma.

07:16.831 --> 07:18.575
- Damn it!
- What?

07:18.750 --> 07:21.241
Rachel. She's stuck in St. Louis.
I gotta call her.

07:21.419 --> 07:25.368
No seat belt. Lost the pulse
two minutes out. First epi's onboard.

07:32.429 --> 07:34.220
Well?

07:35.098 --> 07:36.426
You're getting married.

07:38.434 --> 07:42.763
It's not exactly what I had in mind
when I used to imagine it.

07:43.147 --> 07:45.186
I remember you running
around the house...

07:45.357 --> 07:50.268
...with one of your ballet tutus on your
head, pretending it was a wedding veil.

07:50.445 --> 07:51.690
If I'm not mistaken...

07:51.863 --> 07:55.942
...weren't you going to marry that little
freckle-faced boy down the street?

07:56.117 --> 07:58.524
Tommy Bradshaw.

07:58.702 --> 08:00.778
I wonder whatever happened to Tommy.

08:00.954 --> 08:04.619
He was indicted for insurance fraud.

08:04.791 --> 08:06.202
Well, there you are.

08:06.376 --> 08:10.539
Things have already turned out better
than you expected.

08:10.713 --> 08:13.120
I wish your father could see you.

08:13.299 --> 08:15.706
Yeah. Well, maybe he couldn't
get another flight.

08:15.884 --> 08:18.292
Oh, I'm sure he has some excuse.
He always does.

08:18.470 --> 08:20.130
Mother.

08:20.305 --> 08:22.630
You're right. I'm sorry.

08:22.807 --> 08:26.851
I simply can't believe that he wouldn't
at least have made the effort.

08:27.019 --> 08:30.886
Oh, now, don't start crying.

08:31.065 --> 08:34.313
I'll be doing plenty of that
for the both of us.

08:34.484 --> 08:36.477
This is your day.

08:36.653 --> 08:39.903
Your hair is perfect.
Your dress is wonderful.

08:40.073 --> 08:41.946
This color looks fabulous on you.

08:42.991 --> 08:44.403
I didn't have much choice.

08:44.577 --> 08:48.360
Had I worn white, I'd have looked
like I could sink the Titanic.

08:49.581 --> 08:50.956
Only one thing missing.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.659
What's that?

08:57.588 --> 08:59.960
They belonged to your grandmother.

09:00.132 --> 09:05.470
She wore them for her wedding, as did I.
I know you're not one for tradition.

09:05.679 --> 09:09.213
If you were thinking of something old,
something new, something borrowed-

09:09.391 --> 09:11.597
They're beautiful.

09:13.728 --> 09:14.890
Thank you.

09:15.062 --> 09:17.055
It's okay. It's okay, honey.

09:17.231 --> 09:20.397
Don't worry. We're gonna make a video.
You can watch that.

09:20.567 --> 09:23.817
Complains of neck and chest pain.
BP's 124/82. Pulse, 90.

09:23.987 --> 09:25.481
Miss, are you short of breath?

09:25.655 --> 09:28.062
Hurts when I inhale!

09:28.241 --> 09:30.814
- What is it?
- My arm!

09:30.993 --> 09:33.282
Do you guys have the room number?

09:33.829 --> 09:35.572
Pupils are equal and reactive.

09:35.747 --> 09:39.911
Trauma panel, C-spine, portable chest.
Dip a urine.

09:40.085 --> 09:41.116
Any pain back here?

09:41.294 --> 09:42.492
A lot.

09:42.670 --> 09:45.078
We're gonna keep this on
until we clear your x-ray.

09:45.256 --> 09:47.332
- What's wrong with my wrist?
- Which one?

09:47.508 --> 09:48.836
Left.

09:49.009 --> 09:51.002
- Can we take these cuffs off?
- Not a chance.

09:51.178 --> 09:52.838
- Any O-neg here?
- Two in the cooler.

09:53.013 --> 09:54.092
My guy's in arrest.

09:54.264 --> 09:56.837
- She may have a wrist injury.
- Probably did that herself.

09:57.017 --> 09:59.507
She was in a major trauma.
I need to assess her.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.014
I could only get two units.

10:01.187 --> 10:04.721
Normal saline, wide open. Hang the
blood. Amp of epi and 100 of lido.

10:04.899 --> 10:05.930
That's weird.

10:06.108 --> 10:09.109
The badge must have impacted
on the steering column. Okay, clear.

10:10.028 --> 10:12.945
- He's got blunt chest trauma. No vitals.
- Vasopressin. 40, IV.

10:13.114 --> 10:14.525
What should I tell his family?

10:14.699 --> 10:18.281
Just tell them we're doing everything
that we can. Charging again to 360.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.077
Stand clear.

10:20.955 --> 10:22.283
Got a rhythm. Sinus at 50.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.532
- Got a pulse?
- Nope.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.616
Shot twice on the job,
and now the weather kills him.

10:29.462 --> 10:33.127
Okay. Let's run the O-neg in.
I'm gonna resume CPR.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.964
- He's P.E.A., Carter.
- Yeah? So try another mg of atropine.

10:41.056 --> 10:43.132
I hope you're joking.

10:43.308 --> 10:44.968
Well, would you check again?

10:45.143 --> 10:47.017
What is it?

10:47.562 --> 10:50.397
Then I suggest you do that.
Yes, I'll hold.

10:50.606 --> 10:51.804
Is it the limo?

10:51.982 --> 10:53.809
Apparently they don't have your booking.

10:53.984 --> 10:55.395
Like hell! Give it to me.

10:55.569 --> 10:57.727
Don't concern yourself.
I'll take care of this.

10:57.904 --> 11:00.229
- I'll do it.
- I don't want you upsetting yourself.

11:00.407 --> 11:02.897
I won't. Here.

11:03.076 --> 11:04.404
Yes!

11:04.577 --> 11:06.237
Yes!

11:06.996 --> 11:08.905
No. I booked this limousine months ago.

11:09.081 --> 11:10.575
I gave you a deposit.

11:10.749 --> 11:15.292
When you cashed my check, you
guaranteed you'd be here to pick me up.

11:15.462 --> 11:16.493
No!

11:16.671 --> 11:18.249
I don't care if it's raining.

11:18.423 --> 11:22.918
You'll get me to that church if I have to
ride on your back like a bloody donkey!

11:23.094 --> 11:24.671
Perhaps you should eat something.

11:24.845 --> 11:27.336
I do not need to eat.
Nor do I need a spot of tea...

11:27.514 --> 11:31.381
...or a moment's quiet reflection
on this, my special day.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.513
This is America, and sometimes
you have to kick some ass!

11:34.687 --> 11:36.644
We'll take your car and get there early.

11:37.023 --> 11:41.684
Fine. But unless you can drive stick
shift on the right side of the road...

11:41.860 --> 11:43.853
...I am doing the driving.

11:44.029 --> 11:45.903
You can't drive in your condition.

11:46.073 --> 11:50.449
Get your purse, grab the flowers,
and let's go.

11:52.203 --> 11:54.195
Now, listen here, you ignorant bastard-

11:54.372 --> 11:55.700
What's wrong?

11:55.873 --> 11:58.874
Oh, Mark. Sorry.

11:59.042 --> 12:02.458
Nothing, nothing. Where are you?

12:02.629 --> 12:04.206
At the hospital. Both airports...

12:04.381 --> 12:07.547
...are closed due to the storm.
Flights from St. Louis are canceled.

12:08.301 --> 12:09.795
No.

12:09.969 --> 12:11.796
Rachel's pretty upset.

12:11.971 --> 12:13.050
I'm sorry.

12:13.222 --> 12:14.882
Well, what can you do?

12:15.891 --> 12:17.005
Do you want to postpone?

12:17.392 --> 12:19.550
No! Do you?

12:20.061 --> 12:21.970
No, no!

12:22.147 --> 12:25.729
But if the airports are closed, other
guests won't be able to make it either.

12:25.900 --> 12:29.315
Well, if you want to wait...

12:29.486 --> 12:31.395
No, no. I don't want to wait.

12:31.572 --> 12:32.770
Neither do I.

12:32.948 --> 12:33.979
Are you sure?

12:34.157 --> 12:35.188
Let's get married.

12:35.992 --> 12:37.155
Okay.

12:37.327 --> 12:39.996
I'll see you walking down the aisle, then?

12:40.163 --> 12:41.740
I'll be hard to miss.

12:42.498 --> 12:43.577
I love you.

12:44.250 --> 12:45.909
I love you too.

12:47.836 --> 12:49.330
- Smart move.
- What's that?

12:49.504 --> 12:53.087
Not telling her about the tow truck.
Don't need to stress out brides.

12:53.258 --> 12:55.416
- Especially pregnant ones.
- Need an umbrella?

12:55.593 --> 12:56.921
- You have one?
- Yeah.

12:58.262 --> 13:00.089
You transported them
without backboards?

13:00.264 --> 13:02.256
Medics cleared the necks on-site.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.512
Was this a work detail?

13:03.684 --> 13:05.427
No. Busy court day.

13:05.602 --> 13:07.511
I'll work for you, honey.

13:07.687 --> 13:10.973
- Hey, nice stethoscope.
- Let's shut the pie holes, ladies.

13:11.149 --> 13:12.691
Yosh, can you put them somewhere?

13:12.859 --> 13:14.768
- This way.
- We gonna play doctor with you?

13:14.944 --> 13:16.770
- Not a chance.
- What have you got?

13:16.946 --> 13:21.109
Tammy Gabbard, 19, alert,
oriented times three.

13:21.283 --> 13:23.275
Complaining of belly pain
and a scalp lac.

13:23.451 --> 13:24.696
I need to call Joe.

13:24.869 --> 13:28.534
- Vitals?
- BP, 120/80. Brief LOC.

13:28.706 --> 13:30.034
Nice umbrella.

13:30.207 --> 13:31.618
Hey, Mark. You still here?

13:31.792 --> 13:33.998
Not anymore.

13:40.633 --> 13:42.293
Don't bother.

13:42.468 --> 13:43.631
Why? What happened?

13:43.803 --> 13:47.717
Closed. Tree fell on the track at Cermak.
Shorted out the Red Line.

13:47.890 --> 13:50.641
How long is it gonna be down?

13:55.313 --> 13:57.436
Hold on!

13:59.400 --> 14:00.479
Let me on.

14:00.651 --> 14:02.062
Wait for the next one, pal.

14:02.236 --> 14:04.478
- I gotta get to my wedding.
- That's original.

14:04.738 --> 14:07.063
It's true. Why else would
I be carrying this tux?

14:07.241 --> 14:09.447
Look, they towed my car.
The El is down.

14:09.910 --> 14:11.487
Right.

14:11.661 --> 14:14.578
Make room! Make room!
Dead man walking!

14:14.747 --> 14:15.826
Thanks.

14:17.667 --> 14:18.781
Second chest tube is in.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.916
- Back in V-fib.
- Let's charge again. Clear.

14:21.086 --> 14:22.794
C- spine. Type and cross times four.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.335
- Three-sixty. Charge it again. Clear!
- Where are you?

14:25.507 --> 14:28.294
- V-fib. Correcting volume loss.
- Pulse/ox is down to 75.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.499
Did he have a rhythm?

14:29.677 --> 14:32.133
P.E.A. for five minutes.
He degenerated into V-fib.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.847
- How long?
- Thirty minutes.

14:34.015 --> 14:36.173
No response to defibrillation times five.

14:36.350 --> 14:40.264
Okay, call it. Take her. Head injury
and abdominal trauma. BP's dropped.

14:40.437 --> 14:43.853
- Charging to 360. Here we go. Clear.
- Carter, now.

14:44.024 --> 14:46.312
He may have a pericardial effusion
or aortic tear.

14:46.693 --> 14:48.021
- You're done.
- He's a cop.

14:48.194 --> 14:49.522
He's brain-dead!

14:53.532 --> 14:56.319
Time of death, 1458.

14:56.493 --> 14:59.944
I want to see the x-ray before
you clear her C-spine.

15:07.211 --> 15:08.788
Excuse me.

15:08.963 --> 15:10.872
Another beer.

15:15.552 --> 15:17.212
Shady.

15:17.387 --> 15:19.463
Five down.

15:19.639 --> 15:23.470
Oh, yes. Thank you.

15:23.642 --> 15:24.805
Stuck on a layover?

15:24.977 --> 15:27.053
No, my flight's delayed.

15:27.229 --> 15:28.937
Do you mean canceled?

15:29.106 --> 15:31.312
No. It still says "delayed. "

15:31.483 --> 15:34.649
An optimist. Where are you trying
to get to?

15:34.819 --> 15:35.850
Las Vegas.

15:36.070 --> 15:39.071
Oh, so you're not an optimist.
It's a compulsion.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.900
Where do you play?

15:41.075 --> 15:42.569
I'm going there on business.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.988
And whatever the lady's drinking.

15:45.162 --> 15:46.324
Oh, no, thank you.

15:46.496 --> 15:49.069
- We may be here for a while.
- I'm fine. Thanks.

15:49.249 --> 15:53.116
Well, either he's getting a very big tip...

15:53.294 --> 15:56.248
...or you're getting a free drink.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.248
Excuse me.

16:00.676 --> 16:01.920
BP's 90/75.

16:02.094 --> 16:03.173
Has anybody called Joe?

16:03.345 --> 16:04.543
We can't do that, Gabbard.

16:04.721 --> 16:06.512
- Who is Joe?
- My fiancé.

16:06.681 --> 16:09.172
Meth dealer.
She got nailed for holding his drugs.

16:09.517 --> 16:11.640
He was set up.

16:12.561 --> 16:15.230
We got tenderness and guarding
in the left upper quadrant.

16:15.397 --> 16:17.639
Call for a surgical consult and get a CT.

16:17.816 --> 16:20.603
You got a dislocated shoulder
in Curtain Three. She's in pain.

16:20.777 --> 16:21.808
I'm off. Grab Chen.

16:22.028 --> 16:25.194
Dr. Kovac asked for you to take it
before you left.

16:27.867 --> 16:32.445
We'll get an x-ray of your abdomen,
then another doctor's gonna assess you.

16:32.621 --> 16:34.946
Have Surgery see her,
and I'll sign her out to Deb.

16:35.123 --> 16:37.365
- But you're calling Joe!
- I will.

16:39.794 --> 16:42.545
Carter, IV and oral...

16:42.755 --> 16:43.953
...contrast?

16:44.131 --> 16:46.373
Check her BUN and creatinine.
You were going home.

16:46.550 --> 16:48.459
We're still short a few nurses.

16:48.635 --> 16:51.043
- Boyfriend didn't give permission?
- I haven't asked.

16:51.221 --> 16:52.631
You should. You look worse.

16:52.806 --> 16:54.679
Excuse me while I complete
my penance.

16:54.849 --> 16:55.880
He's not doing that.

16:56.059 --> 16:57.469
- Oh, you don't think so?
- John.

16:58.644 --> 16:59.807
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:59.979 --> 17:01.307
You look great.

17:01.897 --> 17:03.640
- Thanks.
- Yeah, you do.

17:03.815 --> 17:06.650
Thank you. Are you sick?

17:06.818 --> 17:08.063
It's just a cold.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.980
You're not going to the wedding?

17:12.156 --> 17:14.314
No, I don't think I'm gonna
be able to go.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.161
Can you tell them I'm sorry
and congratulate them?

17:17.328 --> 17:19.035
Yeah.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.156
Are you ready?

17:21.748 --> 17:23.539
Yeah, in a minute.
Wanna give me a hand?

17:23.708 --> 17:24.739
Sure.

17:26.085 --> 17:30.249
Hi, Veronica. I'm Dr. Carter. This is
Rena. She's helping out in the ER today.

17:30.423 --> 17:32.581
- A well-dressed candy-striper.
- Yeah.

17:32.758 --> 17:35.593
Let's take a look at that shoulder.

17:35.761 --> 17:37.919
Okay. We're not gonna do that again.

17:38.096 --> 17:40.587
Have you been given
any pain medication yet?

17:40.765 --> 17:42.592
Nurse said you could use a local.

17:42.767 --> 17:47.891
I could. But local anesthesia is not
very effective with this type of injury.

17:51.191 --> 17:54.524
I've been clean for a year. Heroin.

17:55.779 --> 17:59.028
Okay. Well, maybe we could try
a mild sedative like Valium.

17:59.198 --> 18:01.523
No, man. The taste will bring me back.

18:02.451 --> 18:05.369
I kept using on the inside.

18:09.041 --> 18:10.700
Oh, that was almost fun.

18:10.876 --> 18:12.702
I thought I was past morning sickness.

18:12.877 --> 18:16.044
Well, I offered to call a cab.

18:16.797 --> 18:18.790
I've never seen it rain this hard.

18:18.966 --> 18:21.801
Why brides get married in June.

18:21.969 --> 18:24.804
I'll be breast-feeding a 4-week-old
in June.

18:29.767 --> 18:30.965
Hello?

18:31.144 --> 18:32.554
We should have called ahead.

18:32.728 --> 18:34.768
It's not a restaurant.
They are expecting us.

18:34.939 --> 18:37.726
- Then why are the doors locked?
- Hello?

18:37.900 --> 18:42.395
- I'd recognize that bickering anywhere.
- Daddy!

18:43.655 --> 18:44.983
I didn't think you'd be here.

18:45.156 --> 18:49.569
I wouldn't have missed this day
for anything. You look radiant.

18:49.744 --> 18:51.736
Belle, it's been a while.

18:51.912 --> 18:54.070
Yes. Ten years, I believe.

18:54.248 --> 18:57.581
You popped by for Elizabeth's
med-school graduation.

18:57.751 --> 19:01.084
I'm so happy you're here. I'd prefer
if I didn't have to separate you.

19:01.254 --> 19:04.171
So please be at least civil to each other
until the reception.

19:04.340 --> 19:06.000
Hopefully, I'll be drunk then.

19:06.258 --> 19:09.259
- No doubt.
- Good behavior! I'm serious.

19:09.428 --> 19:13.010
Of course. Do I get to meet the groom
before I hand you over?

19:13.181 --> 19:14.379
Mark's not here?

19:16.518 --> 19:17.928
Your umbrella is poking me.

19:18.102 --> 19:19.762
Sorry.

19:22.189 --> 19:27.100
Oh, for Pete's sake, leave it.
The damn things give you brain cancer.

19:29.446 --> 19:32.945
Can somebody ask the driver
what the problem is?

19:35.368 --> 19:37.775
- Excuse me. Coming through.
- Hey, watch it.

19:37.954 --> 19:39.198
Sorry. Excuse me.

19:39.872 --> 19:43.122
Excuse me. Why isn't the bus moving?

19:43.292 --> 19:44.536
Engine seized.

19:44.710 --> 19:45.872
So we're broken down?

19:46.044 --> 19:47.538
Another bus on the way.

19:47.712 --> 19:49.041
When?

19:49.214 --> 19:50.672
When it gets here.

19:53.050 --> 19:54.081
Let me out.

19:54.260 --> 19:58.886
- Raining like hell out there.
- I know. Thanks. Let me out.

20:07.480 --> 20:10.397
Lungs are fine. Neck is clear.
We can take off the collar.

20:10.566 --> 20:14.184
I think I broke something in here.
I couldn't walk at all.

20:14.361 --> 20:17.148
Any pain in your abdomen?

20:17.489 --> 20:19.398
Yeah, she hurts everywhere.

20:19.574 --> 20:21.483
All right, tell me if this is tender.

20:21.659 --> 20:23.533
Wait, lower.

20:24.745 --> 20:27.070
Right there. Right there.

20:27.248 --> 20:31.411
Send her for an AP pelvis.
I want to rule out a ramus fracture.

20:31.585 --> 20:34.123
- We're gonna get an x-ray, Sara.
- Okay.

20:34.296 --> 20:35.327
She's playing you.

20:37.590 --> 20:39.333
You've had a C-section?

20:39.509 --> 20:40.754
Yeah. So?

20:40.927 --> 20:42.504
Any chance you're pregnant now?

20:42.678 --> 20:47.221
No. I got fixed after Diana.

20:47.391 --> 20:50.806
I got pictures. But these cuffs!

20:50.977 --> 20:52.056
Save it, Morris.

20:52.228 --> 20:54.849
I'm missing my visit with her right now.

20:55.023 --> 20:56.682
I don't know when I'll see her next.

20:57.316 --> 20:58.347
Why?

20:58.526 --> 21:00.352
My sister's moving to L.A.

21:00.527 --> 21:03.362
And there's no one else
to take care of her.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.190
She's 7.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.070
I got four years mandatory
before I see her again.

21:08.243 --> 21:10.615
Should've thought
before you broke parole.

21:10.787 --> 21:12.945
I just wanted to see her today.
That's all.

21:13.122 --> 21:15.364
- She's probably better off.
- Shut up!

21:15.541 --> 21:17.533
You shut-

21:17.710 --> 21:22.170
Sara. Sara, I'm gonna come back
after the x-ray, okay?

21:29.804 --> 21:32.639
You just keep giving resistance
to the pressure I apply, okay?

21:32.806 --> 21:34.217
Veronica, you ready?

21:34.391 --> 21:35.636
Do it.

21:35.809 --> 21:37.885
Here we go.

21:38.311 --> 21:40.434
No, no, no. You gotta keep pulling.

21:40.605 --> 21:41.720
Right. Okay, sorry.

21:42.482 --> 21:43.561
Here we go.

21:45.234 --> 21:48.151
- That's it. Hold it right there, Rena.
- She needs more sedation.

21:48.320 --> 21:52.318
She's a former addict. She doesn't
want any narcotics. I gave her a local.

21:52.491 --> 21:55.990
- She needs more than that.
- I offered. She refused.

21:56.327 --> 21:57.786
- Stop.
- I almost got it.

21:57.954 --> 21:59.329
Stop!

22:01.582 --> 22:02.613
Abby?

22:02.792 --> 22:05.080
She asked me not
to administer narcotics.

22:06.003 --> 22:08.042
- Give her 10 of morphine.
- No!

22:08.213 --> 22:09.672
No! Keep going.

22:09.840 --> 22:12.165
We need to relax you to pop
your shoulder back.

22:12.342 --> 22:14.583
She's my patient.
I want to respect her wishes.

22:14.761 --> 22:18.758
If we don't, you could end up
with permanent nerve damage.

22:20.599 --> 22:23.635
Okay. Okay.

22:24.186 --> 22:25.846
Push the morphine, Abby.

22:26.021 --> 22:28.262
Okay. You know what?
I'm off the clock.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.274
She's all yours. I'm out of here.
Let's go.

22:41.368 --> 22:45.994
I had a dream last night that I'd be
in a car wreck, but I'd survive.

22:46.164 --> 22:49.367
My grandmother could predict
when her cat would get sick.

22:49.542 --> 22:54.583
In the dream, I strangled a female doctor
with my bare hands.

22:55.047 --> 22:57.086
Hey, Cleo. Is Malucci here yet?

22:57.257 --> 22:58.288
No.

22:58.466 --> 23:02.380
We're done. Someone'll be back
to fit you for crutches. Just sit tight.

23:02.553 --> 23:05.305
You should get dressed now.
So when he gets here, we can go.

23:05.473 --> 23:08.426
This might not happen, between
this storm and how swamped we are.

23:08.601 --> 23:11.138
- You should go ahead without me.
- Are you serious?

23:11.311 --> 23:13.884
Yeah, Malucci only said he'd try.
He couldn't promise.

23:14.064 --> 23:15.724
- What?
- Cleo, come on.

23:15.899 --> 23:17.393
That would've been nice to know.

23:17.567 --> 23:19.725
It would've been nice
if you'd asked me to go.

23:19.902 --> 23:21.065
- What? I did.
- No.

23:21.237 --> 23:24.107
You RSVP'd and told me
to save the date. Cindy Purcelli?

23:24.281 --> 23:25.312
Right here.

23:25.491 --> 23:28.694
All right. So, what are you saying?
You don't want to go?

23:28.869 --> 23:31.739
I don't have a need to attend
your ex-girlfriend's wedding.

23:31.913 --> 23:34.534
Cleo, we dated. It's no big deal.
She's getting married.

23:34.707 --> 23:35.738
Peter.

23:35.917 --> 23:39.166
Listen, if you don't want to go,
just say you don't want to go.

23:39.336 --> 23:40.368
All right.

23:40.838 --> 23:42.830
- All right what?
- I don't want to go.

23:43.924 --> 23:45.916
- Fine.
- Amira, I need a car.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.251
- What are you doing back?
- A car. I need a car-

23:48.428 --> 23:51.512
Peter! Peter, can I borrow your car?
I need to get to the church.

23:51.681 --> 23:54.254
- I'm on my way now.
- Right. Perfect. Can you take me?

23:54.433 --> 23:55.844
Come on.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.927
I'll just change in your car.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.226
Where's Cleo?

24:10.364 --> 24:11.527
Are people arriving?

24:11.699 --> 24:13.525
A few.

24:18.788 --> 24:19.951
Any sign of Mark?

24:20.874 --> 24:23.495
He'll be here. Where's Isabelle?

24:24.126 --> 24:27.875
She went off looking for someone
to complain to about the temperature.

24:31.466 --> 24:34.218
So I'm going to be a grandfather.

24:34.386 --> 24:36.295
This won't affect my dating, will it?

24:36.471 --> 24:37.846
One can only hope.

24:38.306 --> 24:44.225
Yes. Well, maybe I'll be better
at it a generation removed.

24:44.436 --> 24:45.599
Parenting.

24:46.688 --> 24:48.895
Listen, I didn't turn out that badly, did I?

24:49.441 --> 24:50.816
That was luck!

24:52.777 --> 24:55.980
You gonna continue to practice
after the baby's born?

24:56.447 --> 24:57.562
Eventually.

25:05.247 --> 25:06.278
What?

25:06.790 --> 25:08.450
Nothing.

25:08.625 --> 25:09.870
That's good!

25:10.960 --> 25:12.703
I know what you're thinking.

25:12.962 --> 25:16.461
For years I criticized you and Mummy
for all the time you spent working.

25:16.632 --> 25:18.042
Now I'm about to do the same.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.876
I'm sure you'll strike a better balance.

25:21.219 --> 25:22.678
You don't believe that.

25:22.887 --> 25:24.168
Actually, I do.

25:27.183 --> 25:28.381
No answer?

25:28.559 --> 25:30.717
Just the church service schedule.

25:30.895 --> 25:33.302
Elizabeth is gonna be on the verge
of a meltdown.

25:33.480 --> 25:34.974
Yeah, I bet.

25:35.148 --> 25:40.059
Between the weather, and her mother,
and her father, who I have yet to meet.

25:40.236 --> 25:41.647
Oh, he's okay.

25:41.821 --> 25:44.490
- You know him?
- Yeah, I met him.

25:44.657 --> 25:47.408
That's right.

25:47.576 --> 25:50.114
Why aren't we moving?

25:51.246 --> 25:52.824
We should've taken the expressway.

25:52.998 --> 25:55.915
- You said not to take the expressway.
- I know. I know.

26:00.338 --> 26:01.369
Is he a nice guy?

26:01.547 --> 26:02.578
Who?

26:02.756 --> 26:04.334
Elizabeth's dad.

26:04.508 --> 26:06.335
Well, he seemed nice.

26:06.510 --> 26:08.087
That's good.

26:08.261 --> 26:11.215
Because her mother can really be
a piece of work.

26:11.514 --> 26:12.868
- Yeah.
- What is it with women...

26:12.874 --> 26:14.342
...and their mothers?

26:14.377 --> 26:17.220
I mean, I got along with my mom. You?

26:18.020 --> 26:19.183
She was the best.

26:19.522 --> 26:21.597
Must be a chick thing.

26:21.774 --> 26:23.433
And weddings really bring it out.

26:28.363 --> 26:29.940
So have you met Cleo's mom?

26:30.114 --> 26:31.941
- No.
- Really?

26:32.116 --> 26:34.951
Thought you guys were
pretty serious.

26:41.541 --> 26:43.119
What the hell is the problem?

26:46.462 --> 26:48.538
This isn't gonna leave a scar, is it?

26:48.714 --> 26:50.374
Not that you'd notice.

26:50.549 --> 26:53.040
A nurse will be by to put on a dressing.

26:53.218 --> 26:56.005
Jing-Mei, we've got
a hypothermic 10-year-old coming in.

26:56.221 --> 26:58.379
- ETA?
- Ten to 15.

26:58.556 --> 26:59.801
Set up some warm saline.

26:59.974 --> 27:01.350
Close the exit!

27:01.517 --> 27:04.554
- No!
- Morris! Morris!

27:04.729 --> 27:07.302
Now, Morris!

27:13.236 --> 27:14.565
Get the cuffs on her!

27:14.738 --> 27:17.407
- Leave me alone! Let go!
- What happened?

27:17.573 --> 27:19.233
She jumped off the table and ran.

27:19.450 --> 27:21.775
- Stop!
- She bit me! The bitch bit me!

27:21.952 --> 27:24.787
- You're hurting her. Stop it!
- I'm missing my daughter!

27:24.955 --> 27:26.366
Where's the cuffs?

27:26.957 --> 27:28.202
- Stop.
- Stop!

27:28.375 --> 27:32.206
I'm missing my daughter! No!

27:32.378 --> 27:33.707
Come on!

27:33.880 --> 27:38.874
Please! I have to see my daughter!
I have to see her!

27:42.638 --> 27:44.096
How was that wine?

27:44.264 --> 27:46.387
Oh, it was very nice. Thanks.

27:46.558 --> 27:49.227
- I'm getting a refill. You want one?
- I really shouldn't.

27:49.394 --> 27:51.386
Oh, come on. You're not driving.

27:51.979 --> 27:53.058
You're tenacious.

27:53.230 --> 27:56.148
- Is that a yes?
- Okay. Only if I buy this round.

27:56.317 --> 27:59.401
Even better. Excuse me.
Two more, please.

27:59.569 --> 28:02.356
- May I?
- Sure.

28:02.530 --> 28:04.072
- I'm Mike.
- Hi, Mike. I'm Kerry.

28:05.158 --> 28:06.735
You working on your novel?

28:06.909 --> 28:10.408
No. No, I was just writing
a letter to a friend.

28:10.579 --> 28:13.829
- E-mail or actual letter writing?
- An actual letter.

28:13.999 --> 28:17.368
A lost art. The last letter I wrote was
to Marcia Brady.

28:18.253 --> 28:19.415
Did she write you back?

28:19.587 --> 28:22.078
No. Never really got over it.

28:22.256 --> 28:23.419
I'm sorry.

28:23.591 --> 28:25.749
What do you do when you're not
writing letters?

28:26.343 --> 28:27.506
I'm a doctor.

28:27.678 --> 28:30.085
- Really?
- Yeah. Emergency medicine.

28:30.931 --> 28:31.962
Brains too.

28:32.516 --> 28:34.888
- That's impressive.
- Thanks.

28:35.060 --> 28:36.174
- Damn it!
- What?

28:36.352 --> 28:39.602
It's dead. I dropped it,
and it must have-

28:39.772 --> 28:41.599
Calm down. There's nothing you can do.

28:41.774 --> 28:43.517
- I'm missing it!
- No, you're not.

28:43.692 --> 28:45.601
It started, Peter.

28:45.777 --> 28:46.975
Obviously, it hasn't.

28:47.154 --> 28:48.185
I am screwed.

28:48.363 --> 28:50.521
She'll wait, Mark.

28:52.867 --> 28:54.112
Mark, what are you doing?

28:54.952 --> 28:56.612
Mark!

29:04.795 --> 29:06.870
Mark, get off my car!

29:07.047 --> 29:09.502
I'm trying to see what the hang-up is.

29:09.674 --> 29:10.705
Mark, get down!

29:10.883 --> 29:14.797
I think I see lights. Maybe a cop.
Maybe a rig.

29:14.970 --> 29:17.128
Mark, get down! Now!
Come on, man! Get down!

29:17.306 --> 29:21.220
Seven-year-old male, environmental
exposure with secondary hypothermia.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.469
- This is ice.
- Rain's freezing everything.

29:23.645 --> 29:25.187
Any idea how long he's been down?

29:25.355 --> 29:28.059
Groundskeeper found him
down on the soccer field. No ID.

29:28.232 --> 29:29.810
Guess the game got rained out.

29:29.984 --> 29:32.142
- Where's the rest of his team?
- Or his parents?

29:32.319 --> 29:34.062
BP is 70 palp. Core temp is 86.

29:34.238 --> 29:35.815
Pupils are slow but reactive.

29:35.989 --> 29:38.906
Set up for re-warming.
Start a second line of warm saline.

29:39.075 --> 29:41.910
- And put in a Foley.
- He's about 80 pounds, soaking wet.

29:42.078 --> 29:45.660
- I'll be right there.
- Let's get him out of these wet clothes.

29:45.831 --> 29:49.366
She just wants to see you.
Is that so hard?

29:49.543 --> 29:52.828
I know it's been a long time. How
many years has she served for you?

29:53.046 --> 29:55.122
Hello?

29:55.882 --> 29:56.913
Jerk.

29:57.091 --> 29:59.214
- Who's a jerk?
- Nobody.

29:59.844 --> 30:02.085
- You feeling any better?
- No.

30:02.263 --> 30:05.347
Why don't you go lie down?
I'll take you home when I'm done.

30:05.516 --> 30:07.674
Okay, I just have to finish this first.

30:08.602 --> 30:10.594
Are you mad at me?

30:10.770 --> 30:13.854
Me? No.

30:15.775 --> 30:18.182
You were a little hard on Carter.

30:19.361 --> 30:21.852
- He wasn't listening to me.
- He's a good doctor.

30:22.072 --> 30:23.981
And he's been here for a long time.

30:24.157 --> 30:25.735
And I'm his Attending.

30:26.076 --> 30:28.993
I know. It's just...

30:29.162 --> 30:30.572
...he's my friend.

30:31.539 --> 30:32.570
So?

30:32.748 --> 30:36.082
He's a nice enough guy.
But he's got to let me do my job.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.825
- Isn't he your supervisor?
- Technically.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.755
So this has nothing to do
with him dating your ex?

30:41.923 --> 30:46.335
No. Actually, Abby and I
never really went out.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.337
- You said you did.
- I made that up.

30:48.512 --> 30:51.134
- Why would you make that up?
- I'll explain later.

30:51.307 --> 30:53.844
- So you'd like to go out with her?
- Hey, Dave!

30:54.017 --> 30:56.259
- Nice weather, huh?
- Do you know Rena?

30:56.436 --> 30:58.512
- Yeah. How are you doing?
- Fine, thanks.

30:58.688 --> 31:01.226
- I didn't think you'd come.
- Cleo didn't need me...

31:01.399 --> 31:03.854
...and a few girls from Sal's party
like weddings.

31:04.110 --> 31:05.355
Did you RSVP for them?

31:05.569 --> 31:07.858
There's bound to be
a couple of no-shows.

31:08.030 --> 31:11.564
Few extra butts in the pews
couldn't hurt. Where can I dump this?

31:11.742 --> 31:15.276
They'll probably have
a gift table at the reception.

31:15.453 --> 31:17.861
I'm supposed to lug this around?
It's heavy.

31:18.039 --> 31:22.416
- Didn't buy them a crock pot, did you?
- We got something off the registry.

31:22.585 --> 31:26.416
I'm not into that. "Here's a list
of things to buy me. " It's dicky.

31:28.381 --> 31:29.959
Evening, gentlemen.

31:31.051 --> 31:35.926
What? You didn't think I'd be invited?
So where's the bride?

31:36.097 --> 31:38.801
She's in waiting.
Dr. Greene hasn't shown yet.

31:38.974 --> 31:43.303
Really? Well, if he's smart
he's halfway to Mexico by now.

31:46.856 --> 31:48.564
...runs me off the road!

31:48.733 --> 31:52.066
- It's my wife!
- Ex-wife, you cheating son of a bitch!

31:52.236 --> 31:55.272
Kept ramming me over and over,
completely out of control.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.116
- Can you control your zipper, Kevin?
- Look at this!

31:58.283 --> 32:01.118
Shove your mid-life crisis up your ass!

32:01.286 --> 32:03.492
You could have killed me, Brenna.

32:03.663 --> 32:05.323
Everybody, settle down.

32:05.748 --> 32:09.876
- How long before you clear the street?
- Sir, would you step off to the side?

32:10.044 --> 32:11.668
I'm getting married.

32:11.837 --> 32:13.995
- Get back to your car.
- Nothing's moving.

32:14.172 --> 32:16.959
- We're waiting for a tow truck.
- Hey, I'm a doctor.

32:17.133 --> 32:20.798
- Any chance you'd give me a lift?
- You're joking, right?

32:21.304 --> 32:24.008
I heard he's awake.
What are his vitals?

32:24.181 --> 32:28.345
- BP's 100/70. Temp's 97.
- Good.

32:29.478 --> 32:31.304
Hey.

32:31.980 --> 32:37.318
Hi. I'm Dr. Chen.
You're in a hospital.

32:37.485 --> 32:40.735
You were very cold. We had
to warm you up through your tummy.

32:40.905 --> 32:43.775
It might hurt for a while,
but you're gonna be okay.

32:44.658 --> 32:47.065
Can you tell me your name?

32:47.661 --> 32:50.661
Bryan Cooley.

32:52.165 --> 32:56.992
Bryan, do you remember what happened?

32:58.087 --> 33:03.507
I was waiting.
I think I fell asleep on the field.

33:04.009 --> 33:06.381
What were you waiting for?

33:07.345 --> 33:10.262
They were supposed to pick me up.

33:10.473 --> 33:13.723
Who? Your teammates?

33:13.893 --> 33:19.099
My parents. They forgot.

33:19.356 --> 33:23.021
Well, there's a pretty bad
storm outside.

33:23.193 --> 33:25.730
Maybe they were just running late.

33:25.903 --> 33:29.817
No. They work a lot.

33:30.366 --> 33:33.035
Sometimes they forget.

33:37.872 --> 33:39.865
- Are you denying it?
- I had to work late!

33:40.041 --> 33:42.199
- Doris!
- What are you doing here?

33:42.376 --> 33:45.330
I'm stuck.
Can you give me a ride to Northbrook?

33:45.504 --> 33:48.707
- That's outside my area.
- I'm trying to get to my wedding.

33:48.882 --> 33:50.542
- When?
- Now.

33:50.717 --> 33:54.216
- Okay. If you help me clear the scene.
- Sure. Let's hurry.

33:54.387 --> 33:56.878
- Screwing around was an accident?
- You're crazy.

33:57.056 --> 34:00.010
- I'm home having your baby.
- We have to check you over.

34:00.184 --> 34:02.177
- I'm fine.
- Let her check your signs.

34:02.353 --> 34:03.384
Let him bleed.

34:03.562 --> 34:05.887
If you're okay, you can take yourself.

34:06.064 --> 34:07.689
- Who are you?
- I'm a doctor.

34:07.858 --> 34:10.016
- Hit your head?
- What do you think?

34:10.193 --> 34:13.562
- Mark, what are you doing?
- I'm gonna catch a ride with Doris.

34:13.737 --> 34:16.193
- I got it. Wait in the car.
- No. Check her out.

34:16.364 --> 34:19.235
- Did you lose consciousness?
- Is there any pain?

34:19.409 --> 34:21.568
Is she getting more fat
put in her lips?

34:21.745 --> 34:24.911
She didn't slam her car into anybody,
you psychotic bitch!

34:25.081 --> 34:28.913
- We need to check your head.
- He doesn't think with that head.

34:29.085 --> 34:30.958
Are you all right? Okay, come on.

34:31.128 --> 34:32.539
- Oh, my God!
- What is it?

34:32.713 --> 34:34.587
- My water broke.
- When are you due?

34:34.757 --> 34:36.748
- Tuesday.
- Is this your first baby?

34:36.925 --> 34:40.922
- No. I gave this bastard a son.
- How long was your first labor?

34:41.096 --> 34:42.922
- Oh, boy!
- What is it?

34:43.098 --> 34:45.553
The baby's doing somersaults.

34:45.975 --> 34:49.225
- Sit down.
- What's wrong?

34:49.395 --> 34:54.637
- Your grandchild is getting restless.
- He's not the only one.

34:54.815 --> 34:56.809
Have we heard anything from the groom?

34:56.985 --> 35:01.278
I'm sure he'll be here momentarily.
We'll let you know.

35:01.447 --> 35:05.445
Make yourself useful, Charles.
Get us a glass of water.

35:08.287 --> 35:11.952
- I hope Mark didn't get cold feet.
- Oh, no.

35:12.124 --> 35:15.409
Surely he would've called
if there was a problem.

35:15.585 --> 35:18.788
Yes. Well, he's not answering
his cell phone.

35:18.963 --> 35:21.584
He probably left it at work
with his wallet.

35:21.757 --> 35:27.047
Men get just as nervous as women
on their wedding day. Right, Charles?

35:27.220 --> 35:31.798
Well, to be honest, I was never more...
More anxious.

35:31.975 --> 35:34.181
Practically forgot
it was our wedding day.

35:34.352 --> 35:36.843
That could've been wishful thinking.

35:37.021 --> 35:40.105
It would've saved me
several years of grief.

35:40.274 --> 35:42.100
Stop it, please, just for one day!

35:42.276 --> 35:45.110
- We were teasing.
- Well, don't! It's not funny.

35:45.278 --> 35:48.813
Oh, he'll be here, Elizabeth.
Don't fret.

35:48.990 --> 35:53.651
But I do fret!
Every time he's late, I fret.

35:53.828 --> 35:58.987
Every time he slurs a word, gets tired
or bumps his head, I fret!

36:00.250 --> 36:05.326
I'm about to get married.
And I'm afraid. Not of being with him.

36:05.505 --> 36:11.293
But of being without him. I'm afraid
he won't be around to raise this child.

36:11.510 --> 36:14.843
But you told me the last MRI
showed no recurrence.

36:15.013 --> 36:19.011
- The new therapies offer a long survival.
- We don't know that for sure.

36:19.184 --> 36:23.133
Oh, darling, don't start crying now...

36:23.312 --> 36:25.554
...or we'll never get
through the ceremony.

36:26.982 --> 36:29.853
Say something, Charles.

36:32.195 --> 36:35.066
You're going to have
a wonderful life together.

36:36.574 --> 36:39.195
Your mother and I love you very much,
Elizabeth.

36:39.368 --> 36:44.445
And we will always be there for you.
You know that.

36:50.712 --> 36:53.037
Breathe! Just relax.
Blow through the pain.

36:53.214 --> 36:55.919
I'll give you a ride
after we drop her off.

36:56.092 --> 36:58.547
I can't.
I'm better off riding with Peter.

36:58.719 --> 37:00.593
- I have lights and siren.
- Right.

37:00.762 --> 37:02.885
- Go, go! Good luck!
- Thanks.

37:03.056 --> 37:04.550
- Brenna?
- Don't talk to me.

37:04.724 --> 37:06.516
- I wanna come.
- We're full.

37:06.684 --> 37:08.511
- Keep him away!
- She's my wife!

37:08.728 --> 37:12.939
Radio County. Have them call
the church. Tell Elizabeth where I am.

37:13.107 --> 37:14.898
- Brenna-
- Go away!

37:21.990 --> 37:24.362
Let's go.

37:29.830 --> 37:32.997
He was found unconscious
on a soccer field.

37:33.167 --> 37:35.159
I thought his mother was getting him.

37:35.335 --> 37:39.582
He was hypothermic. But we brought
his body temperature back to normal.

37:39.756 --> 37:41.878
So he'll be all right?

37:42.049 --> 37:44.754
We'd like to keep him overnight
for observation.

37:45.094 --> 37:48.011
He thinks you forgot about him.

37:49.756 --> 37:53.212
I guess we did. It's just...

37:54.188 --> 37:56.157
It's been a real bad few months.

37:56.192 --> 37:58.939
Mr. Cooley, Bryan almost died.

37:59.106 --> 38:01.680
He understands you both
are busy and work a lot-

38:01.859 --> 38:06.485
His mother and I are going through
a divorce. We haven't told him yet.

38:06.655 --> 38:09.110
That doesn't mean
you can forget about him.

38:09.282 --> 38:12.698
Dr. Chen. We got a mother
in active labor following an MVA.

38:12.869 --> 38:14.446
- When?
- Just rolled in.

38:14.620 --> 38:16.494
Excuse me. Is she full-term?

38:16.664 --> 38:19.368
Contractions every eight minutes,
says Dr. Greene.

38:19.541 --> 38:20.786
Who?

38:20.959 --> 38:24.542
Thirty-two-year-old, G-2, P-1.
Fetal heart tones 1/40.

38:24.713 --> 38:26.871
- BP's 120/80.
- I have to push.

38:27.048 --> 38:29.586
No, Brenna.
You got to wait till we get upstairs.

38:29.759 --> 38:31.336
- I can't hold it.
- Yes, you can.

38:31.510 --> 38:32.542
What happened?

38:32.720 --> 38:36.669
- Oh, nothing. I'm fine.
- We'll take it. Go to your wedding.

38:36.849 --> 38:39.007
- But I need my gurney.
- Take it later. Go!

38:39.184 --> 38:42.303
- Good luck, Dr. Greene.
- You know, I need a shirt.

38:42.479 --> 38:44.388
- Luka, give him yours.
- What?

38:44.564 --> 38:45.939
Give him your shirt.

38:46.983 --> 38:48.441
Is this a private party?

38:48.651 --> 38:51.854
Mommy, Daddy,
I think you know Dr. Romano.

38:52.029 --> 38:55.528
Yes. I believe you were operating
on a dog last time we met.

38:55.699 --> 38:58.783
Right. You were in town
attending an astrology conference.

38:58.952 --> 39:02.403
- Astronomy.
- I don't wanna break up this love fest.

39:02.580 --> 39:05.153
Your guests are getting ready
to eat each other.

39:05.332 --> 39:07.870
- I have $50 Greene'll be a no-show.
- Robert.

39:08.043 --> 39:09.751
But we just heard from the ER.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.707
It seems that your ex-boyfriend
and future hubby...

39:12.881 --> 39:14.920
...played paramedic on the way here.

39:15.091 --> 39:16.716
- He's with Peter.
- Not anymore.

39:16.884 --> 39:19.755
Greene's still out there saving
some pregnant woman.

39:19.971 --> 39:21.630
- What?
- Suffice it to say...

39:21.805 --> 39:26.514
...if you give him a few more minutes,
I'm gonna lose that bet.

39:36.235 --> 39:38.987
You look beautiful, Elizabeth.

39:39.154 --> 39:44.112
- Thank you, Robert.
- Greene's a lucky man.

39:44.492 --> 39:46.200
I know.

39:49.705 --> 39:54.082
I always wanted to move to Florida,
just get away from the ice and snow.

39:54.251 --> 39:58.118
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know. It never worked out.

39:58.297 --> 40:01.214
I know what you mean.
By this time I always thought...

40:01.383 --> 40:03.708
...I'd be married
with two kids and a dog.

40:03.885 --> 40:05.924
Well, you can always get the dog.

40:06.095 --> 40:10.555
That's true enough. How about you?

40:10.724 --> 40:13.345
You don't live with,
like, 50 cats or anything?

40:13.560 --> 40:16.395
- No.
- I didn't think so.

40:16.563 --> 40:19.599
Too pretty to be
one of those crazy cat ladies.

40:19.774 --> 40:22.347
Flight 2247 to Portland...

40:22.527 --> 40:27.022
You were right. Some of those flights
were just delayed. That was mine.

40:28.866 --> 40:32.115
Maybe when we' re both in town
again, we could have dinner?

40:32.285 --> 40:35.072
Since we've already had drinks.

40:35.246 --> 40:39.374
I'm not so sure that
that would work out.

40:39.542 --> 40:45.247
Oh, okay. Well, thanks for the drink.

40:45.422 --> 40:48.091
And thanks for the company. Really.

40:48.258 --> 40:52.302
If you ever change your mind,
or you find yourself stranded...

40:53.388 --> 40:56.970
- Enjoy Las Vegas, Kerry.
- Thanks.

41:17.326 --> 41:20.575
My last jailbird
had an ingrown hair in her groin.

41:20.745 --> 41:22.453
- How lucky is that?
- Hey.

41:22.622 --> 41:24.828
- What happened?
- Have you seen Dr. Finch?

41:24.999 --> 41:27.668
- I think she's in the lounge.
- Oh, great.

41:35.300 --> 41:36.759
Peter, what are you doing here?

41:36.927 --> 41:38.836
An accident. Where are you going?

41:39.012 --> 41:41.633
On my way to meet you
at the reception.

41:41.806 --> 41:44.297
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. Do you think it's too late?

41:44.475 --> 41:46.302
- No, I don't think it is.
- Good.

41:46.477 --> 41:49.347
Whoa, what makes you think
I still want to?

41:49.521 --> 41:52.308
- Because you like to dance with me.
- Oh, I do, do I?

41:52.482 --> 41:56.859
- Yeah. Let's go.
- You know you're looking good.

41:57.028 --> 41:59.815
- Thanks. You look wet.
- Mind stopping so I can change?

41:59.989 --> 42:01.566
- We'll take my car.
- The keys.

42:01.740 --> 42:03.116
- You're not driving.
- I am.

42:03.283 --> 42:05.953
Why does a guy automatically think
he has to drive?

42:06.119 --> 42:10.448
Hi, Linda? Yeah, hi.
This is Jing-Mei Chen.

42:10.623 --> 42:12.782
No, no. Everything's fine.

42:12.959 --> 42:18.000
It's just, I thought I'd call and...
I got your card.

42:18.172 --> 42:22.418
Oh, yeah. He's beautiful.

42:22.718 --> 42:24.260
Is that him?

42:26.262 --> 42:32.134
He's laughing already?

42:36.438 --> 42:39.107
Really?

42:43.653 --> 42:45.396
- Thanks.
- Your jacket.

42:45.613 --> 42:48.186
Your jacket! Good luck!

43:08.008 --> 43:10.629
- Are you Mark?
- Yes.

43:10.802 --> 43:13.838
- Glad you could make it.
- Sorry.

44:04.017 --> 44:06.175
Good luck.

44:12.316 --> 44:17.392
- Nice of you to show up.
- It was raining.

44:19.739 --> 44:22.574
Dearly beloved...
