00:11.945 --> 00:15.416
all: WELL?

00:15.483 --> 00:16.917

00:16.984 --> 00:18.886
- SCHPINGO!

00:18.952 --> 00:21.355
[excited shouting]

00:21.422 --> 00:23.324
- AND PEOPLE CAN BUY THIS...
IN STORES?

00:23.391 --> 00:24.592
- NOT YET.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.428
- THE RECORD COMPANY
WILL NOT RELEASE IT

00:27.495 --> 00:30.398
UNTIL THEY ANNOUNCE
YOUR BIG TIME...

00:30.464 --> 00:32.233
TOUR!

00:32.300 --> 00:33.301
- AH!

00:33.367 --> 00:35.203
- WHAT?
- WE'RE GOING ON TOUR?

00:35.269 --> 00:39.240
- AND YOUR FIRST CONCERT
IS IN TWO WEEKS.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.111
- * BECAUSE THE NIGHT IS YOUNG *

00:43.177 --> 00:44.912
* THE LINE IS OUT THE DOOR *

00:44.978 --> 00:46.680
* TODAY WAS CRAZY *

00:46.747 --> 00:50.351
* BUT TONIGHT
THE CITY'S OURS *

00:50.418 --> 00:52.186
* THE CITY *

00:52.253 --> 00:54.688
* THE CITY IS OURS *

00:54.755 --> 00:56.557
[music stops]

00:56.624 --> 00:58.492
- SHOULD I TELL THEM
THAT PREPARING FOR A CONCERT

00:58.559 --> 01:00.661
WILL BE THE HARDEST THING
THEY'VE EVER DONE...

01:00.728 --> 01:02.596
AND THAT IT'S NOT
IN TIMES SQUARE?

01:02.663 --> 01:04.332
- OH, LET THEM HAVE
THEIR FANTASY.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.466
THEY LOOK SO HAPPY.

01:05.533 --> 01:06.500
- FINE.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.835
I'LL GIVE THEM ANOTHER MINUTE.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.737
THEN I'LL BURST THEIR BUBBLE.

01:09.803 --> 01:13.707
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH *

01:13.774 --> 01:15.709
- * MAKE IT COUNT,
PLAY IT STRAIGHT *

01:15.776 --> 01:17.545
* DON'T LOOK BACK,
DON'T HESITATE *

01:17.611 --> 01:21.649
- * WHEN YOU GO BIG TIME *

01:21.715 --> 01:23.751
- * WHAT YOU WANT,
WHAT YOU FEEL *

01:23.817 --> 01:25.386
* NEVER QUIT
AND MAKE IT REAL *

01:25.453 --> 01:28.456
- * WHEN YOU ROLL BIG TIME *

01:28.522 --> 01:29.590
- * OH-OH, OH-OH *

01:29.657 --> 01:31.359
- * HEY, HEY *

01:31.425 --> 01:33.527

01:33.594 --> 01:35.363
- * HEY, HEY *

01:35.429 --> 01:37.598
- * DON'T YOU FEEL THE RUSH *

01:37.665 --> 01:39.167

01:39.233 --> 01:40.168

01:46.874 --> 01:49.343
* WITH THE LIFE YOU CHOOSE *

01:49.410 --> 01:52.946
* IF YOU WANT IT ALL,
LAY IT ON THE LINE *

01:53.013 --> 01:57.751
* IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU GOT
SO YOU GOT TO LIVE IT BIG TIME *

02:00.921 --> 02:01.989
- THE CONCERT STAGE,

02:02.055 --> 02:04.425
WHERE YOU WILL NEED
INTENSE FOCUS...

02:04.492 --> 02:07.361
- INCREDIBLE STAMINA, AND...

02:07.428 --> 02:11.199
- EXPERT KNOWLEDGE
OF EVERY INCH.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.267
- WHY ARE WE WEARING DOG CONES?

02:13.334 --> 02:15.503
- BECAUSE DURING YOUR CONCERT,
YOU GOT TO...

02:15.569 --> 02:16.804
* LOOK AT YOUR FANS! *

02:16.870 --> 02:20.508
NOT YOUR FEET!

02:20.574 --> 02:22.876
- AND TO AVOID EXTREME INJURY,

02:22.943 --> 02:24.478
YOU HAVE TO KNOW
WITHOUT THINKING

02:24.545 --> 02:27.748
AND SEE WITHOUT LOOKING.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.417
FLIPPY FLIP!

02:31.752 --> 02:32.786
- WHAT IF WE HAVE AN ITCH?

02:32.853 --> 02:33.954
- DON'T!

02:34.021 --> 02:35.256
- PLACES.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.824
FOCUS.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.692
BEGIN.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.094
- * OH-OH, OH OH-OH *

02:41.229 --> 02:42.996
* OH-OH, O OH-OH *

02:43.063 --> 02:44.131
- * HEY, YEAH *

02:44.232 --> 02:47.568
[crashing and clattering]

02:47.635 --> 02:49.370
[music stops]

02:49.437 --> 02:52.072
- THEY ACTUALLY LASTED LONGER
THAN I EXPECTED.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.541
AGAIN!

02:53.607 --> 02:57.478
[funky bass guitar]

02:57.545 --> 03:00.514
[drums clattering]

03:00.581 --> 03:01.582
AGAIN!

03:01.649 --> 03:02.616
- * FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT *

03:02.683 --> 03:06.687
[rollicking bluesy music]

03:06.754 --> 03:08.121
- AGAIN!

03:08.256 --> 03:12.326
* *

03:12.393 --> 03:14.262
all: EEEEGH!

03:14.262 --> 03:15.563
AH!

03:15.629 --> 03:16.630
WHOA!

03:16.697 --> 03:19.767
* *

03:19.833 --> 03:21.402
[cat yowling]

03:21.469 --> 03:29.310
* *

03:30.444 --> 03:32.446
- OH!

03:32.513 --> 03:35.283
- AND LASTLY,
THE SPOTLIGHT TEST.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.289
[all screaming]

03:43.691 --> 03:45.025
[all groaning]

03:45.092 --> 03:46.994
- I WILL X-PEDIATE
THEIR TRAINING

03:47.060 --> 03:49.096
AND HAVE THEM X-READY.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.465
- GREAT, NOW, LET'S MOVE ON

03:51.532 --> 03:53.066
TO THE HARD PART
OF YOUR TRAINING.

03:53.133 --> 03:54.602
- AWESOME.
- RIGHT ON.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.470
- RUN!

03:56.537 --> 03:59.407
[frantic shouting]

04:03.110 --> 04:05.078
- HIDING'S NOT GONNA SOLVE
ANYTHING.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.114
- NO, BUT IT WILL TEMPORARILY
KEEP US ALIVE,

04:07.180 --> 04:08.516
AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

04:08.582 --> 04:10.751
BUT I LIKE LIVING!

04:10.818 --> 04:12.386
- I THOUGHT TRAINING
WAS KIND OF FUN.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.455
- THAT'S YOUR CONCUSSION
TALKING.

04:16.790 --> 04:21.128
- LOOK, GUYS,
GUSTAVO MIGHT BE LOUD, MEAN,

04:21.194 --> 04:25.366
OBNOXIOUS, SELF-ABSORBED...
UNATTRACTIVE.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.634
both: GET TO THE POINT.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.736
- PUT IT IN HOCKEY TERMS.

04:30.404 --> 04:33.240
- IN TWO WEEKS WE HAVE
THE BIGGEST GAME OF OUR LIVES.

04:33.341 --> 04:36.109
WE HAVE TO TRAIN OUR BUTTS OFF
FOR IT, OR WE COULD LOSE.

04:36.176 --> 04:38.679
NO MATTER HOW ROUGH
THE FIRST PERIOD WAS,

04:38.746 --> 04:41.449
WE HAVE TO GET BACK ON THE ICE.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.550
AH!

04:42.616 --> 04:44.051
- HEY, GUSTAVO WANTS--

04:44.117 --> 04:45.653
all: WE'RE COMING.
WE'RE COMING.

04:45.719 --> 04:46.687
- REALLY?

04:46.754 --> 04:48.255
OH, WELL...

04:48.356 --> 04:50.190
ONE OF YOU GUYS WANT A RIDE
BACK TO THE STAGE?

04:50.257 --> 04:51.725
- OOH, I'LL TAKE ONE.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.699
- YOU'RE IRONING?

04:58.766 --> 04:59.967
I'M IMPRESSED.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.369
- IT'S A PROTOTYPE

05:01.369 --> 05:03.871
OF MY BIG TIME RUSH
CONCERT MERCHANDISE.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.939
KENDALL TEXTED ME
ABOUT THE BIG CONCERT TOUR,

05:06.006 --> 05:08.642
AND I PLAN ON CASHING IN.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.077
- OH, HONEY,
THE RECORD COMPANY

05:10.143 --> 05:11.845
OWNS THE RIGHTS
TO ALL THAT STUFF.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.147
YOU CAN'T JUST SELL
BIG TIME RUSH GEAR.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.049
- YES, I CAN.
IT'S CALLED BOOTLEGGING.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.919
I'M GONNA SELL POSTERS TOO.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.888
- HOW DID YOU GET LIKE THIS?

05:20.954 --> 05:23.123
I NEVER DROPPED YOU, NOT ONCE.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.959
- MOM, I'M PUTTING
MY LIFE SAVINGS INTO THIS,

05:26.026 --> 05:28.496
AND WITH THE STANDARD
500% CONCERT MARK-UP,

05:28.562 --> 05:30.764
I COULD MAKE 20 GRAND.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.534
- I WANT 75% OF ALL PROFITS
GOING INTO YOUR COLLEGE FUND.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.836
- YES!

05:35.903 --> 05:39.006
ORDER IS PLACED,
AND YOU ARE THE BEST MOM EVER.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.208
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

05:41.274 --> 05:44.845
- OKAY, TIME FOR
FAN PREPAREDNESS TRAINING

05:44.912 --> 05:47.415
WITH THE NUMBER ONE TEEN IDOL,

05:47.415 --> 05:52.052
DAK ZEVON.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.221
- GUYS, FANS ARE YOUR FRIENDS,

05:54.287 --> 05:56.457
BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE FRENZIED,

05:56.524 --> 06:01.094
WHICH IS WHY LESSON ONE
OF THE ZEVON METHOD IS:

06:01.161 --> 06:03.230
PROPER FAN INTERACTION,

06:03.296 --> 06:06.600
OR P'FIE.

06:06.667 --> 06:07.801
[blows whistle]

06:07.868 --> 06:10.771
[kids screaming]

06:14.307 --> 06:16.209
OKAY, NOW, OBSERVE CAREFULLY

06:16.276 --> 06:18.779
HOW I DEMONSTRATE
THE MOSH PIT HAND SLAP.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.749
[kids screaming]

06:22.983 --> 06:24.618
OKAY, JAMES,
NOW YOU TRY IT.

06:24.685 --> 06:25.786
- ALL RIGHT.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.121
- YEAH, JAMES!
- LET'S GO, JAMES!

06:28.188 --> 06:30.891
- OH, NO, JAMES!

06:30.958 --> 06:32.893
- THAT WAS WRONG.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.161
WE'LL FIND JAMES LATER.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.796
NOW YOU GUYS TRY IT.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.965
AND REMEMBER,
SLAP THE HANDS QUICKLY.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.934
[kids screaming]

06:45.806 --> 06:46.940
[blows whistle]

06:47.007 --> 06:48.008
EXCELLENT.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.342
- YES.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.182
- MY UNDERWEAR IS GONE.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.217
- NOW, SECURITY GUARDS
WILL PROTECT YOU

06:57.284 --> 06:59.787
FROM 99% OF THE CROWD,

06:59.853 --> 07:05.058
BUT 1% OF YOUR FAN BASE
WILL BE INSANE AND GET TO YOU.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.326
- AH!
- I LOVE YOU!

07:06.393 --> 07:07.260
I LOVE YOU!
I LOVE YOU!

07:07.327 --> 07:10.130
[indistinct shouting]

07:10.197 --> 07:11.765
- YOU'RE BIGGER THAN HER!

07:11.832 --> 07:13.767
- WHAT KENDALL SHOULD HAVE DONE
THERE IS DUCK.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.303
UH, YOUR FEET
ARE TOO CLOSE TO THE EDGE.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.371
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

07:18.506 --> 07:21.208
- WAH!
[kids shouting]

07:23.877 --> 07:27.314
- HEY, HONEY, I'M BACK FROM...
THE...

07:27.380 --> 07:28.516
GYM.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.518
- OVER HERE, MOM!

07:34.755 --> 07:37.558
IT IS AMAZING HOW FAST YOU CAN
GET PRODUCT IN THIS TOWN.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.859
- WHAT IS THIS?

07:38.926 --> 07:40.327
- IT'S CHEAPER TO BUY IN BULK.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.829
AND IF YOU STOP YELLING,

07:41.895 --> 07:44.598
I'LL PUT 80% OF THE PROFITS
INTO MY COLLEGE FUND.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.033
- I'M NOT GONNA YELL.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.801
INSTEAD, I'M GOING TO GET
AN ASPIRIN...

07:47.868 --> 07:50.738
TO STOP THE HEADACHE THAT WILL
BE ARRIVING IN ABOUT ONE MINUTE.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.244
KATIE!

07:57.310 --> 07:59.813
- BOYS, I AM PROUD OF YOU.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.848
- UGH!
GET OUT OF HERE!

08:00.914 --> 08:02.282
- I LOVE YOU, KENDALL!

08:02.349 --> 08:03.617
I LOVE YOU!

08:03.684 --> 08:05.085
MARRY ME!

08:05.152 --> 08:07.555
- THIS CONCERT
IS GONNA TAKE BTR

08:07.555 --> 08:09.990
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

08:10.057 --> 08:13.827
AND YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST
DRESS REHEARSAL IN THREE DAYS.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.663
- AND WE WANT YOU TO INVITE

08:15.729 --> 08:17.230
ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS
FROM THE PALMWOODS

08:17.297 --> 08:21.234
SO YOU CAN PRACTICE
YOUR STAGE SWAGGER.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.837
- SO YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE US
BACK TO THE PALMWOODS, RIGHT?

08:23.904 --> 08:24.972
- NO.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.374
A CONCERT CAN LAST TWO HOURS,

08:27.440 --> 08:29.109
AND YOU'LL NEED MORE ENDURANCE

08:29.176 --> 08:32.580
THAN A MARATHON RUNNER
CARRYING A COW.

08:32.646 --> 08:35.716
- WHICH IS WHY YOU'LL BE
RUNNING BACK TO THE PALMWOODS,

08:35.783 --> 08:38.886
CARRYING THESE MICROPHONES.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.121
- [screeches]

08:41.188 --> 08:43.356
- MOVE, MOVE, MOVE IT!

08:43.423 --> 08:45.759
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH *

08:45.826 --> 08:47.094
- HO-HO!

08:47.160 --> 08:50.463
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH *

08:50.598 --> 08:52.132
- SO WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

08:52.199 --> 08:54.668
- THEY HAVE THEIR FIRST CONCERT
IN TWO WEEKS.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.136
GUSTAVO'S TRAINING THEM,

08:56.203 --> 08:58.238
AND ROCQUE RECORDS HAS A BETTER
COFFEE MAKER THAN WE DO.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.440
- DON'T WORRY.
GUSTAVO WILL SLIP UP.

09:00.608 --> 09:05.078
AND WHEN HE DOES,
HAWK WILL DESCEND UPON HIS PREY.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.314
CAW!
CAW!

09:07.380 --> 09:09.016
ADDED A SECOND "CAW."

09:09.082 --> 09:10.417
- I'D STICK WITH ONE.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.088
- ARE YOU GUYS GONNA MAKE IT

09:15.155 --> 09:16.757
THE NEXT TWO WEEKS
TO YOUR CONCERT?

09:16.824 --> 09:19.392
- AH!
- UH!

09:19.459 --> 09:23.130
[shouting and blubbering]

09:23.196 --> 09:25.699
- YEP.
AND IT'S GONNA ROCK!

09:25.766 --> 09:28.268
- AND YOU AND ALL THE PALMWOODS

09:28.335 --> 09:31.238
ARE INVITED
TO OUR DRESS REHEARSAL.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.640
- COOL.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.274
WE'RE V.I.P.s.

09:34.341 --> 09:37.177
- SOMEDAY WE'LL BE ABLE TO SAY
WE KNEW THEM WHEN.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.047
- HEY, SOMEDAY IS TODAY.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.883
I HAVE DREAMED ABOUT THIS
FOR SO LONG.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.517
AND IT'S FINALLY GONNA HAPPEN.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.053
- I LOVE YOU!

09:46.119 --> 09:47.187
I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU,
I LOVE YOU!

09:47.254 --> 09:48.221
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.222
IT'S PART OF OUR TRAINING.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.190
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.693
GET OFF ME!

09:52.760 --> 09:55.763
- * WHEN EVERY DAY
FEELS LIKE THE OTHER *

09:55.829 --> 09:58.398
* AND EVERYWHERE LOOKS
JUST THE SAME *

09:58.465 --> 10:01.301
* WHEN EVERY DREAMS
SEEMS LIKE FOREVER *

10:01.368 --> 10:03.971
* AND YOU'RE A FACE
WITHOUT A NAME *

10:04.037 --> 10:06.506
* BABY, NOW IS OUR BEST CHANCE *

10:06.573 --> 10:09.276
* TO FINALLY GET IT RIGHT *

10:09.342 --> 10:12.012
* 'CAUSE IF THE WORLD
IS AN APPLE *

10:12.079 --> 10:14.614
* THEN IT'S TIME
TO TAKE A BITE *

10:14.682 --> 10:17.517
* SOMEDAY IT'LL COME TOGETHER *

10:17.584 --> 10:20.553
* SOMEDAY WE WILL WORK IT OUT *

10:20.620 --> 10:24.491
* I KNOW WE CAN TURN IT UP
ALL THE WAY *

10:24.557 --> 10:27.494
* 'CAUSE THIS IS OUR SOMEDAY *

10:27.560 --> 10:29.763
* 'CAUSE WHAT WE'RE MAKIN' *

10:29.830 --> 10:31.498
* IS RIGHT HERE AND NOW *

10:31.564 --> 10:34.567
- * WHY WAIT, WAIT, WAIT *

10:34.634 --> 10:37.771
* 'CAUSE THIS IS OUR SOMEDAY *

10:37.838 --> 10:39.406
* OH, OH, OH-OH OH *

10:39.472 --> 10:40.874
- OH!

10:40.941 --> 10:43.110
- * OH, OH, OH-OH OH OH OH *

10:43.176 --> 10:46.013
* WE'VE ALL HAD TIMES,
TIMES WE WONDER *

10:46.079 --> 10:48.481
* WILL THE SPOTLIGHT
SHINE ON ME *

10:48.548 --> 10:51.384
* AND DON'T LET THE WAVES
GO AND PULL US UNDER *

10:51.451 --> 10:54.021
* I'LL MISS THE OPPORTUNITY *

10:54.087 --> 10:56.790
* DON'T LOOK DOWN OR LOOK BACK *

10:56.857 --> 10:59.426
* IT'S NOT THAT FAR TO GO *

10:59.492 --> 11:01.561
* 'CAUSE IF WE NEVER TRY *

11:01.628 --> 11:04.631

11:17.745 --> 11:20.080
* 'CAUSE WE'RE MAKIN' *

11:20.147 --> 11:21.882
* IS RIGHT HERE AND NOW *

11:21.949 --> 11:24.517
- * WHY WAIT, WHY WAIT,
WHY WAIT *

11:24.584 --> 11:28.922
* 'CAUSE THIS IS OUR SOMEDAY *

11:28.989 --> 11:31.759
- BRAVO.
BRAVO!

11:31.825 --> 11:34.194
WATCHING YOU BOYS GO
FROM NOBODIES TO SOMEBODIES

11:34.261 --> 11:36.830
HAS BEEN MORE THRILLING
THAN HUNTING HUMANS,

11:36.897 --> 11:38.766
WHICH IS WHY IT HURTS ME TO SAY

11:38.799 --> 11:41.068
THE ALBUM, TOUR,
AND THIS CONCERT...

11:41.134 --> 11:42.202
ARE CANCELLED.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.403
both: WHAT?

11:43.470 --> 11:44.404
all: WHAT?

11:44.471 --> 11:45.505
crowd: WHAT?

11:45.572 --> 11:46.373
all: WHAT?
- WHAT?

11:46.439 --> 11:48.275
- WHAT?

11:48.341 --> 11:49.476
I MEAN YEAH.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.511
BIG TIME RUSH IS DEAD.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.118
all: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THE BAND IS DEAD?

11:58.185 --> 12:00.220
- ACCOUNTING HAS JUST RELEASED
THEIR RISK AND FEASIBILITY

12:00.287 --> 12:01.321
REPORT ON BIG TIME RUSH,

12:01.388 --> 12:02.689
AND THEY DECIDED IT'S TOO RISKY

12:02.790 --> 12:04.424
AND NOT FEASIBLE.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.326
- OH!

12:06.393 --> 12:09.362
- WE'RE SHIFTING OUR STRATEGY
TO CHILDREN'S BOOKS ON TAPE.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.098
NO TOUR SUPPORT IS REQUIRED.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.800
THEY HAVE A HIGHER
PROFIT MARGIN

12:12.866 --> 12:14.835
AND ARE SUPER CHEAP TO MAKE.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.204
- WHICH IS WHY TOMORROW
GUSTAVO WILL BE PRODUCING

12:17.270 --> 12:18.571
CAN YOU FOO?

12:18.638 --> 12:20.307
AS READ BY
ACTOR-ENVIRONMENTALIST

12:20.373 --> 12:22.409
ED BEGLEY JR.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.212
- BUT, GRIFFIN,
THIS IS OUR SOMEDAY.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.014
- CLOSE.
IT'S YOUR LAST DAY.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.849
SORRY, FELLAS,
I LIKE YOU; I DO.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.050
BUT AS WE SAY IN BUSINESS...

12:30.117 --> 12:31.251
both: THAT'S BUSINESS.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.652
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

12:32.719 --> 12:34.654
WE'VE BEEN WORKING
OUR BUTTS OFF!

12:34.721 --> 12:37.290
OUR CONCERT IS IN ONE WEEK.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.725
- DON'T WORRY.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.594
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING
ALL OF YOU...

12:41.661 --> 12:43.163
FRUIT BASKETS.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.270
- GREAT, I JUST SPENT
3,000 BUCKS

12:50.337 --> 12:52.572
MAKING T-SHIRTS, POSTERS,
AND HATS

12:52.639 --> 12:54.307
ON A BAND
THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.210
- I'LL TAKE A HAT.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.280
IT'LL BE A NICE MEMORY
OF WHAT ALMOST WAS.

13:00.347 --> 13:04.317
- THAT'LL BE $3,000.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.418
[knocking]

13:05.485 --> 13:07.620
JAMES, THE MOVING VAN
IS COMING.

13:07.687 --> 13:10.257
YOU HAVE TO COME OUT
OF THE BATHROOM.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.458
- I AM DREAMING.

13:11.524 --> 13:12.659
YOU ARE NOT REAL.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.094
HA!
THE CONCERT'S IN A WEEK!

13:14.161 --> 13:16.396
[laughs crazily]

13:16.463 --> 13:17.865
- CLASSIC DENIAL RESPONSE.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.199
IT'S SAD, REALLY.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.268
- KATIE,
YOU NEED TO PACK YOUR THINGS.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.870
- I'M DREAMING.
YOU'RE NOT REAL!

13:22.903 --> 13:25.205
THE CONCERT'S IN ONE WEEK!

13:28.408 --> 13:30.177
- I KNOW THIS TOWN
CRUSHES DREAMS

13:30.243 --> 13:33.213
BUT NOT WHEN THEY'RE SO CLOSE
TO COMING TRUE.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.283
- I'M REALLY GONNA MISS
ALL THIS.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.019
AND I'M ALSO GONNA MISS...

13:39.086 --> 13:40.687
I MEAN...

13:40.753 --> 13:43.991
YOU KNOW, UH...

13:44.057 --> 13:46.626
I'M NOT GOOD AT GOOD-BYES.

13:46.693 --> 13:49.429
- WELL, THEN, HERE'S SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER ME BY.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.270
- WOW.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.039
SHE'S REALLY GOOD AT GOOD-BYES.

14:02.175 --> 14:05.778
- I NEVER THOUGHT THAT OUR
FIRST KISS WOULD BE OUR LAST.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.150
- DO I GET SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER YOU BY?

14:10.217 --> 14:12.719
- OF COURSE.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.460
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE
GOING BACK TO MINNESOTA.

14:23.263 --> 14:26.366
OKAY...
NOW I BELIEVE IT.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.635
- THIS DREAM IS SO REAL.

14:28.701 --> 14:32.239
THIS TOTALLY LOOKS
LIKE MINNESOTA!

14:32.305 --> 14:33.373
- KENDALL, YOU'RE BACK.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.841
CAN YOU TAKE
THE AFTERNOON SHIFT?

14:34.942 --> 14:36.043
- I--
- GREAT.

14:38.445 --> 14:42.815
- NO!

14:42.950 --> 14:43.816
- DO YOU FOO?

14:43.951 --> 14:45.718
I KNOW I CAN FOO.

14:45.785 --> 14:49.656
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN FOO TOO.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.691
- AAAAHHH!

14:51.758 --> 14:53.026
- GOOD JOB, ED.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.661
LET'S TAKE FIVE AND...

14:54.727 --> 14:58.531
PLAY WITH SOME OF THOSE TOYS
I PUT IN THE BOOTH FOR YOU.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.502
YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T EVEN
TELL THEM GOOD-BYE.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.672
- I...
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.474
- HOW ABOUT THAT YOU CARE
ABOUT THEM

15:07.540 --> 15:09.142
AND YOU'LL DO SOMETHING
TO FIX THIS?

15:09.209 --> 15:10.743
- I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

15:10.810 --> 15:14.414
I'M UNDER CONTRACT
WITH RCM/CBT/GLOBALNET LOSERS

15:14.481 --> 15:16.749
TO PRODUCE ALBUMS.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.751
I CAN DO THIS.

15:18.818 --> 15:21.454
I'M AMAZING.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.755
ED!

15:22.822 --> 15:24.491
ALL RIGHT, GREAT JOB.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.293
LET'S TRY PAGE TWO.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.727
- [clears throat]

15:27.794 --> 15:28.795
YOU CAN.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.397
YOU CAN FOO.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.733
BUT CAN YOU FOO ROO
THE BOO MOO GOO?

15:33.800 --> 15:36.803
- I MISS THE GUYS SO MUCH!

15:36.869 --> 15:38.771
AAAHHH!

15:38.838 --> 15:40.773
- ME TOO!

15:40.840 --> 15:42.542
[both crying]

15:42.609 --> 15:43.776
I MISS THEM.

15:50.417 --> 15:51.418
- T-SHIRTS!

15:51.484 --> 15:53.320
GET YOUR BIG TIME RUSH T-SHIRTS!

15:53.386 --> 15:56.589
IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR CLEANING RAGS
AND ORGANIC DOG FOOD.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.558
- KATIE...

15:58.625 --> 15:59.892
NOT HELPING.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.395
- YEAH.
BUT THE POOL DISPLAY IS.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.364
WHOO!

16:04.431 --> 16:05.365
WHOO!

16:05.432 --> 16:06.633
- IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES

16:06.699 --> 16:08.101
AND CARLOS SPLASHES WATER
ON YOU,

16:08.168 --> 16:09.636
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE STILL
AT THE PALMWOODS.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.571
[laughs]

16:11.638 --> 16:14.041
- WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP
THE BAND GOING.

16:14.074 --> 16:17.244
WE'LL KEEP REHEARSING
AND GET BACK TO L.A.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.878
WE CANNOT GIVE UP.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.713
- WE'RE NOT GIVING UP.

16:20.780 --> 16:21.881
WE'RE MOVING ON.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.283
AND I'M NOT GONNA WASTE

16:23.350 --> 16:24.551
A PERFECTLY GOOD DAY
OF MY LIFE

16:24.617 --> 16:26.886
FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.122
NONE OF US SHOULD.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.823
- I SMELL SPEECH.

16:30.890 --> 16:34.427
- LOGAN, WAS IT YOUR DREAM
TO BE A HOLLYWOOD POP STAR

16:34.494 --> 16:36.529
OR A DOCTOR?

16:36.596 --> 16:37.564
- A DOCTOR.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.831
- THEN CALL UP THAT PREP SCHOOL

16:38.898 --> 16:40.200
YOU SAY ALL THE DOCTORS
COME FROM

16:40.267 --> 16:41.734
AND GET AN INTERVIEW.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.636
- GOOD SPEECH SO FAR.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.906
- AND, CARLOS,
WHAT WAS YOUR DREAM?

16:46.973 --> 16:49.342
- TO BE HIT
BY A RADIOACTIVE METEOR

16:49.409 --> 16:50.977
AND FIGHT CRIME AS...

16:51.078 --> 16:54.847
METEOR MAN.

16:54.914 --> 16:57.450
- OKAY.
WE CAN WORK ON THAT.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.452
- THOSE DREAMS ARE STUPID!

16:59.519 --> 17:02.489
AND YOU'RE STUPID,
BECAUSE GUSTAVO'S COMING BACK.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.191
- COMING BACK?

17:04.257 --> 17:07.227
HE DIDN'T EVEN SAY GOOD-BYE.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.895
LOOK AROUND, JAMES.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.997
THERE'S NOBODY PULLING UP
IN A SHINY CAR

17:11.098 --> 17:13.466
OFFERING TO MAKE OUR DREAMS
COME TRUE.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.104
- KENDALL KNIGHT?

17:17.137 --> 17:18.571
- YES?

17:18.638 --> 17:20.640
- I'M THE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR
AT MINNESOTA UNIVERSITY.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.609
AND THIS IS AN INVITATION

17:22.675 --> 17:24.811
TO SKATE WITH THE TEAM
THIS SATURDAY.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.980
- THIS IS THE GOLDEN GOPHER
HIGH SCHOOL ALL-STAR SKATE.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.582
HOW DID YOU--

17:29.649 --> 17:32.018
- YOUR MOM TOLD ME
I COULD FIND YOU HERE.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.986
AND I HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE.

17:35.355 --> 17:38.258
- [laughing]

17:38.325 --> 17:40.693
- THIS PARKING LOT
HAS BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.695
- YOU ARE ALL QUITTERS.

17:42.762 --> 17:46.733
BIG TIME RUSH IS NOT DEAD!

17:46.799 --> 17:48.000
- OH--

17:51.838 --> 17:54.141
- GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.742
- LOGAN MITCHELL,
THE SMART ONE,

17:55.808 --> 17:57.844
WHICH MEANS HE'LL ASK QUESTIONS.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.347
KENDALL KNIGHT,
THE COMPLETE PACKAGE,

18:00.413 --> 18:03.183
BUT STRONG-HEADED,
HARD TO CONTROL.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.018
CARLOS GARCIA, HIGH ENERGY,
A GOOD DANCER,

18:06.153 --> 18:09.289
BUT WEARS A HELMET
FOR NO APPARENT REASON.

18:09.356 --> 18:12.325
JAMES DIAMOND, EXTRA PRETTY,
SOLID VOICE,

18:12.392 --> 18:14.461
DRIVEN BEYOND BELIEF.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.029
[reverberating thud]

18:17.164 --> 18:19.499
- I KNEW GUSTAVO
WOULD SLIP UP.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.902
NOW THE HAWK WILL SWOOP IN
AND CATCH HIS PREY.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.771
CAW-CAW!

18:26.506 --> 18:27.540
REALLY?

18:27.607 --> 18:30.510
WELL, I'M LIKING
THE DOUBLE CAW.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.513
- LET'S ALL RUBBY DUBBY

18:33.580 --> 18:36.816
IN THE FLUBBY WUBBY TUBBY.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.618
GUSTAVO, SHOULD I PUT
THE EMPHASIS

18:38.685 --> 18:40.420
ON "RUBBY" OR "FLUBBY"?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.689
- YOU KNOW, ED,
JUST DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.357
ALL RIGHT?
JUST GO NUTS.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.593
- FINALLY,
A DIRECTOR I CAN WORK WITH.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.628
FLUBBY RUBBY DU--

18:48.695 --> 18:50.963
[booth silenced]

18:51.030 --> 18:51.998
- GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.400
- OKAY, ACCORDING
TO THE RESEARCH,

18:53.466 --> 18:55.435
GRIFFIN SPENT $2 MILLION
ON BIG TIME RUSH.

18:55.502 --> 18:58.605
SO IT'S GONNA COST $2 MILLION
TO BUY THEM BACK.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.273
- $2 MILLION?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.575
WHERE AM I GONNA GET
$2 MILLION?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.444
- I'VE ASSESSED
ALL OF ROCQUE RECORDS' ASSETS,

19:04.511 --> 19:07.347
AND I THINK I FIGURED OUT
A WAY WE CAN DO IT.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.416
- OH, OH, THIS IS GREAT!
THIS IS GREAT.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.083
COME BY MY MANSION
LATER TONIGHT,

19:11.218 --> 19:12.719
AND WE WILL FIGURE
EVERYTHING OUT.

19:12.785 --> 19:16.223
- YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO SELL YOUR MANSION.

19:23.230 --> 19:26.266
- OKAY, I THINK I FINALLY
GOT THIS PLACE CLEANED UP.

19:28.401 --> 19:31.804
UGH, KATIE, DONATE THESE
T-SHIRTS AND POSTERS TO CHARITY!

19:31.871 --> 19:36.142
- I WILL NOT DONATE
MY LIFE SAVINGS.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.144
- OKAY, WHAT'S ON DAY THREE

19:38.245 --> 19:41.281
OF OUR "REBUILD OUR
MINNESOTA DREAMS" SCHEDULE?

19:41.348 --> 19:43.650
- 10:00 A.M.:
GET DOCTOR'S COAT

19:43.716 --> 19:44.984
FOR INTERVIEW AT CRESTVIEW.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.553
DONE.

19:46.619 --> 19:51.258

METEOR MAN IS HERE!

19:56.963 --> 19:58.164
- IT WORKS.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.366
- BUT YOU CAN'T USE METEOR MAN.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.633
THERE WAS A MOVIE IN THE '90s.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.701
- HOW ABOUT...

20:01.768 --> 20:05.071
ASTEROID BOY?

20:05.137 --> 20:06.473

20:06.539 --> 20:08.875

WHEN YOU'RE 35?

20:08.941 --> 20:12.945
- GUGH, IT'S GOT TO BE
SPACE-ROCK-THEMED, OKAY?

20:13.012 --> 20:15.315
NOW, DOCTOR DUDE, HOCKEY BOY,

20:15.382 --> 20:17.650
WE MUST RIGHT WHAT WE WRONGED
IN MINNESOTA

20:17.717 --> 20:22.088
WHEN WE LEFT THIS GREAT LAND
FOR THE WESTERN METROPOLIS.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.090
- WE ARE SO SORRY.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.693
WE--WE KNOW WE LET YOU DOWN,
BUT WE'RE BACK,

20:26.759 --> 20:29.095
AND WE WANT
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

20:29.161 --> 20:32.064
- I DON'T NEED
MY WALKWAY SHOVELED NOW.

20:32.131 --> 20:35.167
I NEEDED IT LAST WINTER,
WHEN YOU BOYS PROMISED.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.936
- WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO?
NAME IT.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.739
- WELL, MY LAWN NEEDS MOWING.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.240

- AND PUT THIS ON MY CAR.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.980
I CAN'T DRIVE ANYMORE.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.249
I HAVE TO TAKE THE BUS NOW.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.489
- IT'S THE CAR
THAT STARTED IT ALL.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.257
- WE DROVE JAMES
TO THAT AUDITION WITH GUSTAVO

20:58.325 --> 20:59.492
IN THIS CAR.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.361
- AND NOW HE'S NOT TALKING
TO US.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.229
- WHAT DO YOU THINK JAMES
IS UP TO RIGHT NOW?

21:03.330 --> 21:04.864
- OH, RIDING AROUND TOWN,

21:04.931 --> 21:07.867
WAITING FOR FAME AND FORTUNE

21:15.207 --> 21:17.143
- UGH.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.778

21:18.845 --> 21:21.948
THE NAME'S HAWK.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.884
CAW!

21:24.951 --> 21:27.987
- THIS APPLICATION ASKS
WHAT MY BIGGEST WEAKNESS IS.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.489
- YOU CAN BE INDECISIVE.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.157
- RIGHT, I'LL PUT THAT.

21:31.223 --> 21:32.492
WAIT, NO, SHOULD I?

21:32.559 --> 21:33.893
I MEAN, YES, I COULD PUT IT,

21:33.960 --> 21:36.028
BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I WANT TO PUT THAT.

21:36.095 --> 21:38.064

21:50.610 --> 21:52.379
I'M PUTTING THE BAD

21:54.381 --> 21:55.281

21:56.449 --> 21:57.684
WHAT DO YOU SAY, GUYS?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.251
YOU WANT TO COME BACK TO L.A.

21:59.386 --> 22:03.189
AND TAKE ONE MORE SHOT
AT THE BIG TIME?

22:03.255 --> 22:04.957
- [sighs]

22:09.596 --> 22:12.198
NO.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.266
GUSTAVO, WE'RE TIRED
OF BEING PUSHED AROUND.

22:14.401 --> 22:16.536
WE'RE GONNA BE A BAND.
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE A BAND.

22:16.603 --> 22:18.471
WHAT YOU WANT.
WHAT GRIFFIN DOESN'T WANT.

22:18.538 --> 22:21.273
I WANT A HOCKEY SCHOLARSHIP.

22:21.408 --> 22:22.842
- I WANT TO BE A DOCTOR.

22:22.909 --> 22:26.879
- AND I WANT TO MAKE THE WORLD
A SAFER PLACE.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.749
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN SAY GOOD-BYE.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.083
- I'M NOT GOOD AT GOOD-BYES!

22:33.285 --> 22:36.022
BUT I BELIEVE IN YOU.

22:36.088 --> 22:38.458
AND YOU'VE TAUGHT ME THINGS,

22:38.525 --> 22:41.828
OTHER THINGS THAT...
I'M NOT GOOD AT,

22:41.894 --> 22:47.299
LIKE FRIENDSHIP AND LOYALTY...

22:47.434 --> 22:50.002
AND FAMILY.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.538
CAN I--CAN I STOP NOW?

22:51.604 --> 22:53.105
- YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

22:53.172 --> 22:54.574
- IF WE GO BACK,

22:54.641 --> 22:57.043
OUR ALBUM WILL BE RELEASED,
RIGHT?

22:57.109 --> 22:58.811
- ONCE PEOPLE SEE YOUR CONCERT,

22:58.878 --> 23:00.747
EVERYTHING ELSE
WILL FALL INTO PLACE.

23:00.813 --> 23:04.083
I'M ALMOST POSITIVE.

23:04.150 --> 23:07.620
- SO YOU WANT US TO PACK UP
EVERYTHING, AGAIN,

23:07.687 --> 23:12.959
FOR A CONCERT THAT MAY
OR MAY NOT LAUNCH OUR ALBUM.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.795

23:54.133 --> 23:56.603
TELL HIM THE BAND'S

23:56.669 --> 23:58.905
- OH, MY GOSH,
THE STUDIO'S BEEN ROBBED!

23:58.971 --> 24:01.508

A JOB FOR...

24:01.508 --> 24:06.078

FLAMING SPACE ROCK MAN.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.515
- [makes buzzer sound]
- NOT EVEN A LITTLE.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.883
- THE STUDIO WASN'T ROBBED.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.085
- I HAD TO SELL EVERYTHING

24:13.152 --> 24:15.287
TO BUY BIG TIME RUSH
BACK FROM GRIFFIN,

24:15.354 --> 24:17.123
INCLUDING...

24:17.189 --> 24:19.391

OH, KELLY!

24:20.660 --> 24:22.161
[crying, sneezing]

24:22.228 --> 24:23.996
- DON'T WORRY, GUSTAVO.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.532
WE WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.767
- AND YOU CAN STAY WITH US
AT THE PALMWOODS.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.769
- YEAH, THERE'S NO MONEY
FOR THE PALMWOODS.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.103
- THEN WHERE ARE WE STAYING?

24:31.170 --> 24:32.539
- EHHHH.

24:32.572 --> 24:35.007
WELCOME TO THE ROCQUEWOODS.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.643
IT'S NOT MUCH, BUT...

24:36.709 --> 24:38.945
WELL, IT'S NOT MUCH.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.547
- AND IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY,

24:40.613 --> 24:44.717
UNTIL YOU GUYS ROCK THE CONCERT
IN FOUR DAYS

24:44.784 --> 24:48.220
AND BIG TIME RUSH
GETS SOME BIG TIME INVESTORS.

24:48.287 --> 24:51.023
- THEN WE GO ON TOUR,
GET YOUR ALBUM RELEASED.

24:51.090 --> 24:54.060
- THEN I GET MY STUDIO
AND MY MANSION BACK.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.897

24:57.964 --> 25:01.167
WE CAN DO THIS.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.770

I'M REMAINING?

MAYBE SOMEBODY AT THE PALMWOODS
HAS SEEN CAMILLE--

WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
BROKEN UP THE BAND.

BUT WE'VE ALWAYS PROMISED SINCE
WE WERE PEEWEE HOCKEY PLAYERS

27:32.484 --> 27:34.453
THAT WE WOULD STICK TOGETHER.

- BUT WE'LL FIX IT.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.741
BUT FIRST,
WE NEED TO FIX THE BAND.

27:54.807 --> 27:57.143
JAMES, WE'RE SORRY.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.878
NOW, LET'S GO.
- COME ON.

27:58.945 --> 28:01.080

28:01.147 --> 28:04.150
BECAUSE HE'S GOT EVERYTHING
HE NEEDS HERE.

28:04.216 --> 28:06.753
RIGHT, JAMES?

I'M LEAVING!

28:34.113 --> 28:36.548
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
JAMES ISN'T COMING BACK?

28:36.615 --> 28:38.150
- HE GOT A THREE-RECORD DEAL.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.086

A THREE-RECORD DEAL

28:41.487 --> 28:42.789

- WHAT CONCERT?

28:54.400 --> 28:58.170
THERE'S NO BIG TIME RUSH
WITHOUT JAMES.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.239
- THEN WE'LL FIND A NEW JAMES.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.274
IF HE THINKS HE CAN DO
WITHOUT US,

29:02.341 --> 29:04.643
THEN WE CAN DO WITHOUT HIM.

29:04.710 --> 29:07.246
- HE'S RIGHT; BANDS REPLACE
MEMBERS ALL THE TIME.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.415
- THE ROLLING STONES
HAD THREE GUITARISTS.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.383
- DESTINY'S CHILD
REPLACED EVERY MEMBER

29:11.450 --> 29:12.718
EXCEPT FOR BEYONCE.

29:12.819 --> 29:16.622

29:31.137 --> 29:32.204

29:32.271 --> 29:34.073
YOU'RE JAMEZ WITH A "Z" NOW.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.342
IT'S "AWEZOME."

29:36.408 --> 29:40.346
- ISN'T THAT TECHNICALLY JA-MEZ?

29:40.412 --> 29:43.549
- I DON'T PAY YOU TO SPEAK,
SEBASTIAN.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.084

- JA-MEZ,
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE FRIENDS

30:18.017 --> 30:19.886
OR DO YOU WANT TO BE FAMOUS?

30:19.952 --> 30:23.890
- AND BESIDES, IF THEY WERE
REALLY YOUR FRIENDS,

30:23.956 --> 30:25.491
WOULD THEY BE SEARCHING
ALL OVER TOWN

30:25.557 --> 30:27.593
FOR YOUR REPLACEMENT?

33:57.703 --> 34:00.472
HAVE THEY EVER LET ME DOWN?

34:00.539 --> 34:01.507
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

34:01.573 --> 34:02.908
THE POINT IS,

34:02.974 --> 34:06.478
JAMES IS NOT COMING BACK.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.581
NOW, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SING,

WE'RE GONNA GO BACK
TO THE PALMWOODS

35:04.703 --> 35:06.438
AND GET OUR OWN SEBASTIAN,
RIGHT?

35:06.505 --> 35:08.540
- AND WHAT ABOUT HAWK?

35:08.607 --> 35:10.909
- WE'LL TALK
ABOUT YOUR SEBASTIAN LATER.

35:10.976 --> 35:12.678
AND WE'VE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS
THAN HAWK,

35:12.744 --> 35:15.414
AS IN THE CONCERT IS IN TWO DAYS

35:15.481 --> 35:17.349
AND WE HAVEN'T SOLD
A SINGLE TICKET

35:17.416 --> 35:20.452
AND ALL THE POSTERS

35:21.953 --> 35:22.954

35:23.021 --> 35:24.556
KATIE WILL DONATE HER POSTERS.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.192

- KATIE, DONATE THEM!

35:27.293 --> 35:29.928

35:29.995 --> 35:33.565
BUT I GET CONCESSION SPACE
FOR MY HATS AND T-SHIRTS.
