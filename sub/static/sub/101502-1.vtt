WEBVTT

00:17.977 --> 00:19.277
Depression...

00:21.580 --> 00:22.715
Anxiety...

00:25.450 --> 00:27.319
Anger issues...

00:30.890 --> 00:34.493
Anti-social habits, eating
disorder, trouble sleeping.

00:37.562 --> 00:38.731
You, uh...

00:39.932 --> 00:41.701
You added your own checkboxes?

00:41.734 --> 00:44.704
Yeah, I just want to make sure
I got it all covered.

00:48.306 --> 00:51.711
Troubled past
and probably cancer.

00:56.248 --> 00:57.416
That's, uh...

00:57.449 --> 00:59.284
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's something.

01:02.855 --> 01:03.956
You think you have cancer?

01:03.990 --> 01:05.590
Mm.

01:05.624 --> 01:06.793
What kind?

01:09.394 --> 01:10.529
Testicular.

01:16.601 --> 01:17.970
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:18.004 --> 01:20.505
I don't think it's very professional
for you to laugh about that.

01:20.539 --> 01:22.975
You're absolutely right, I'm sorry.
Hey, hey, hey!

01:25.277 --> 01:26.578
I am sorry.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.247
And you're right.

01:31.651 --> 01:34.219
You ever think you might
have hypochondria?

01:35.387 --> 01:36.923
What's that?

01:36.956 --> 01:40.960
It's basically when you think there's
something wrong with you or you're sick

01:40.993 --> 01:42.360
but you're actually fine.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.399
Yeah.

01:48.333 --> 01:49.434
That's...

01:52.404 --> 01:53.973
Can I see that for a second?

02:02.882 --> 02:04.282
I need a pen.

02:17.395 --> 02:18.497
Hyp...

02:20.032 --> 02:21.366
O...

03:16.488 --> 03:17.455
Hey, Macy.

03:20.425 --> 03:21.326
Hmm.

03:46.919 --> 03:48.520
Do you work this day?

03:48.553 --> 03:50.156
What day?

03:50.189 --> 03:51.991
The Skills on Wheels thing.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.028
It's the Saturday
before Christmas.

03:56.062 --> 03:58.097
I don't know, probably.

03:58.130 --> 04:01.533
Mitchell always gives me freaking
Saturday shifts! You know that.

04:02.735 --> 04:04.737
So, this girl.

04:04.770 --> 04:06.639
She likes you?

04:06.672 --> 04:09.775
I mean, she more than likes me.
She's obsessed with me.

04:10.977 --> 04:12.611
Mhm.

04:12.645 --> 04:14.881
She stares at me
all the time.

04:14.914 --> 04:19.451
So her feelings for you, the way
she acts. They're exactly what you want?

04:19.484 --> 04:21.854
Right. Yeah.

04:21.888 --> 04:24.957
Then I think I'm a little confused
as to why you would make these,

04:24.991 --> 04:29.427
uh, interactions between you two so
awkward if they don't have to be.

04:31.664 --> 04:34.901
If I make everything perfect,
then it's not authentic enough.

04:34.934 --> 04:36.936
Can you explain that?

04:38.603 --> 04:42.474
Nothing in our world is perfect.
Including the relationships.

04:42.507 --> 04:44.810
Okay.

04:44.844 --> 04:48.681
So, if our conversations went perfectly
every time, then... it would bring me out.

04:48.714 --> 04:52.051
I would lose focus.

04:52.084 --> 04:55.888
So an imperfect world, to you,
is perfect?

04:57.023 --> 04:58.024
I mean...

05:00.793 --> 05:03.162
it definitely makes it
a lot more believable.

05:05.131 --> 05:06.032
Hmm.

05:10.535 --> 05:12.905
How long have you been painting?

05:14.807 --> 05:15.908
I don't know.

05:16.842 --> 05:18.110
Ever since I was young.

05:19.979 --> 05:23.182
Do you like it as much now
as you did when you were young?

05:23.215 --> 05:24.650
I try to.

05:25.651 --> 05:27.186
I don't think I enjoy it
the same way.

05:29.755 --> 05:30.656
Why is that?

05:32.158 --> 05:33.826
Shouldn't you know why?

05:38.064 --> 05:41.267
I have a pretty good idea but
I want to hear what you think.

05:44.170 --> 05:45.771
I guess...

05:50.843 --> 05:53.578
I don't do it
because it makes me happy.

05:53.611 --> 05:55.513
Or to fill any sort of void.

05:58.851 --> 06:02.154
I do it because...
it makes me feel normal?

06:03.723 --> 06:04.857
Normal.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.793
Does your family know
about this?

06:07.827 --> 06:10.162
No, no, and they never will.

06:10.196 --> 06:12.064
I don't talk to them anymore
so...

06:12.098 --> 06:14.233
You don't talk to your family?

06:14.266 --> 06:16.202
Nope!

06:16.235 --> 06:17.602
Well...

06:19.071 --> 06:20.773
- do you want to talk about...
- Nope!

06:26.112 --> 06:27.013
Okay.

06:31.583 --> 06:32.785
Okay.

06:36.655 --> 06:38.190
You know I do find it
very interesting that...

06:39.291 --> 06:42.194
That you know this, uh,
this group of people so well.

06:43.629 --> 06:45.664
But you keep yourself so hidden.

06:45.698 --> 06:47.266
Why's that interesting?

06:47.299 --> 06:49.201
Tells me a lot
about who you are.

06:49.235 --> 06:50.803
How so?

06:52.471 --> 06:56.976
Well, it tells me that you have enough courage
to know them, to associate with them.

06:57.009 --> 07:00.079
But you don't have enough courage
to really know who they are.

07:05.818 --> 07:07.753
What are you afraid of, Jake?

07:13.025 --> 07:16.996
Alright.
You useless sacks of oxygen!

07:18.197 --> 07:20.766
Your fearless leader
has arrived.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.969
Yeah, you wasted sacks
of oxygen!

07:24.003 --> 07:25.838
Thanks! Ow!

07:25.871 --> 07:28.207
- Dammit, Jake!
- Sorry, hand slipped.

07:30.643 --> 07:32.610
Hey, Mitchy! My main man!

07:32.645 --> 07:35.748
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What did I say about calling me that?

07:35.781 --> 07:36.849
Sorry.

07:38.217 --> 07:40.152
- Is everybody here?
- Yeah, I think so.

07:40.186 --> 07:42.955
Good! Let's begin.

07:42.988 --> 07:44.190
Macy!

07:46.025 --> 07:47.259
Office!

07:49.695 --> 07:51.263
That'll be 30 dollars.

07:55.768 --> 07:58.204
Have fun!

08:04.877 --> 08:05.945
Thirty bucks!

08:07.213 --> 08:08.747
Brandon.

08:11.150 --> 08:12.885
Snack Bar!

08:23.362 --> 08:24.730
Liam!

08:26.999 --> 08:29.835
- Skate Shop.
- Next to him?

08:40.779 --> 08:44.116
And you two wonderful
human beings...

08:46.218 --> 08:47.286
rentals!

08:47.319 --> 08:49.822
Oh!

09:36.535 --> 09:38.737
No, come on.

09:46.312 --> 09:48.380
Oh, crap!

09:48.414 --> 09:49.381
Okay.

10:14.173 --> 10:16.342
[birds chirping

12:35.514 --> 12:37.950
- Hey, guys!
- You're late.

12:37.983 --> 12:39.251
Uh, sorry.

12:40.586 --> 12:42.054
I lost track of time.

12:43.188 --> 12:45.290
My main man! How's it going?

12:45.324 --> 12:47.926
He is not
your main man. Stop lying, fool!

12:49.361 --> 12:50.262
Well...

12:58.270 --> 12:59.571
Jake!

12:59.605 --> 13:01.573
Good to see you, man!
I missed you.

13:03.008 --> 13:04.076
It's been what?

13:05.210 --> 13:08.147
Thirty-six hours
since our last meeting?

13:08.180 --> 13:10.916
Uh, yeah, I guess.

13:12.518 --> 13:14.019
Jake.

13:14.052 --> 13:16.522
I like having you around

13:16.555 --> 13:20.225
but... did you notice something when you rode
up here on that piece of shit in two wheels?

13:20.259 --> 13:23.162
- Ben! Come on, man.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

13:23.195 --> 13:25.030
Seriously,
did you notice something?

13:26.666 --> 13:27.566
Um...

13:28.500 --> 13:30.637
You were walking
back and forth?

13:30.670 --> 13:33.972
Walking back, uh, yeah!

13:34.006 --> 13:37.209
What I was doing was sinking
deep into thought.

13:37.242 --> 13:40.612
Pacing from side to side,
to and from, if you will.

13:40.647 --> 13:42.414
Talking to William
about the new draft that I have.

13:42.448 --> 13:44.383
He was talking
about the new guide.

13:44.416 --> 13:47.219
- Ugh! Have you no manners?
- Okay!

13:47.252 --> 13:49.421
- You know what! Okay?
- Yeah, I will!

13:51.223 --> 13:53.158
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.

13:53.192 --> 13:56.395
This guide. What's he talking
about with that?

13:58.230 --> 14:01.366
Ben has these stupid notes
on how to find the perfect girl.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.602
- Really?
- Yeah, but it doesn't work.

14:03.636 --> 14:04.570
I mean...

14:05.504 --> 14:07.606
I followed it. I...

14:07.640 --> 14:10.275
checked off all the boxes
but, um...

14:11.410 --> 14:12.712
it never worked.

14:12.745 --> 14:16.181
So, what?
Is that why you guys meet?

14:17.516 --> 14:19.251
Yeah.

14:19.284 --> 14:20.653
Every few days.

14:22.554 --> 14:28.327
We talk about how the guide helped
us and what needs to be changed.

14:29.528 --> 14:30.529
Okay.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.200
Congratulations.

14:36.602 --> 14:39.271
Oh! Yeah.

14:40.807 --> 14:42.474
Yeah, I found a good one.

14:45.712 --> 14:47.479
What's up with that?

14:47.513 --> 14:48.815
What's that?

14:48.848 --> 14:51.450
You didn't tell me about it.

14:51.483 --> 14:54.654
Well, you're here to talk.
I'm here to listen. You and Ben.

14:55.722 --> 14:59.191
Two single guys.
Got this get-laid guide.

14:59.224 --> 15:01.360
Mhm. Wait, what?

15:01.393 --> 15:03.595
Now what about this third guy,
William?

15:03.630 --> 15:04.563
Oh, yeah.

15:04.596 --> 15:06.098
Well, is he there?

15:06.131 --> 15:08.200
Yeah, he's there.

15:08.233 --> 15:10.637
So, what's up with that?
I thought you said he had a girlfriend?

15:10.670 --> 15:12.337
Well, yeah, he does.

15:12.371 --> 15:15.541
He does? Well what?
Is he not happy with her?

15:17.242 --> 15:18.243
Um...

15:20.145 --> 15:21.480
- No, no!
- Give me that ball back!

15:21.513 --> 15:24.116
William Theodore Brooks!

15:24.149 --> 15:26.385
Bryah the Beast!

15:26.418 --> 15:28.021
- Dude, she just full named you!
- Dude, shut up!

15:28.053 --> 15:31.256
Now I know for a fact that you are not
where you're supposed to be right now!

15:31.290 --> 15:34.092
- Baby, listen!
- Not today! Not today, no!

15:34.126 --> 15:36.829
When I was talking to Kenzie,
about the gossip and the what's what.

15:36.863 --> 15:39.431
She said something!

15:39.464 --> 15:43.468
- She saw you playing ball with your boys down at Trent Park.
- What, no, no, no, baby!

15:43.502 --> 15:47.239
Nah! Now I know, I know
you had a shift this morning.

15:49.274 --> 15:51.376
You still working, right?

15:51.410 --> 15:53.880
You still working, right?

15:53.913 --> 15:55.480
- Listen, Bry. I can...
- Uh-uh! Let's go!

15:55.514 --> 15:58.617
- No, let me just talk to you for a second, I can explain.
- Let's go right now!

15:58.651 --> 15:59.652
Right now, let's go!

16:08.226 --> 16:11.731
Jake. Ben. You all take care.

16:11.764 --> 16:13.733
- Now!
- What is that all about?

16:13.766 --> 16:15.400
- Now!
- And none of that is necessary!

16:15.434 --> 16:17.235
- No, it's all necessary!
- You could've called, you could've texted!

16:31.316 --> 16:33.619
- Hey, what's up, buddy?
- Hey, what's up, man?

16:33.653 --> 16:36.388
- Where is he?
- He's here somewhere.

16:38.357 --> 16:39.726
Thanks.

16:39.759 --> 16:41.193
Yeah.

16:44.631 --> 16:46.465
Oh, God.

16:46.498 --> 16:48.935
Can't a man take a break
around here?

16:48.968 --> 16:51.403
No need for a break
if you're not working hard.

16:53.205 --> 16:55.808
- How you doing, buddy?
- I'm doing okay.

16:55.842 --> 16:57.309
Yeah?

17:01.613 --> 17:02.782
How's Carol?

17:02.815 --> 17:05.317
Good, good! She's good.

17:06.686 --> 17:08.855
I tell you what.
She was a beautiful bride.

17:08.888 --> 17:10.723
Yeah, she was!

17:10.757 --> 17:12.491
About time you all took
that next step.

17:12.524 --> 17:14.694
Yeah.

17:14.727 --> 17:17.664
You know, I was convinced that you
were gonna be speaking at my funeral

17:17.697 --> 17:19.398
before attending
your own wedding!

17:22.534 --> 17:26.605
Well, these things take time. We had to
make sure we were doing the right thing.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.743
Yeah, it's tough to be sure.

17:30.777 --> 17:32.411
About anything, you just...

17:33.813 --> 17:36.548
sometimes you just got
to take a shot!

17:36.581 --> 17:38.283
We're planners!

17:39.484 --> 17:41.754
- We plan.
- Huh. Good luck with that.

17:44.957 --> 17:48.427
You can't plan either, you know,
I know that better than most.

17:55.702 --> 17:57.235
You visit her lately?

17:58.437 --> 18:00.472
I go every Sunday.

18:00.505 --> 18:02.775
Good.

18:02.809 --> 18:07.714
This week, I made a big deal about the
condition of the grass right next to her.

18:08.613 --> 18:14.586
'Cause it was looking dead and all, so
I had to bring out my mean old-man self.

18:14.619 --> 18:17.857
Went off about the fact that they
weren't watering around the edges.

18:18.858 --> 18:20.425
But see here's the deal.

18:20.459 --> 18:23.696
If... if you don't water
right next to the stone

18:23.730 --> 18:28.668
then it all turns brown and then
it spreads and it's not good.

18:29.902 --> 18:30.870
Thank you, buddy.

18:31.804 --> 18:32.939
Thank you.

18:34.874 --> 18:35.775
Yeah.

18:38.811 --> 18:41.613
Listen, I know you're
a grown man, Sean.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.250
Just always remember...

18:46.618 --> 18:48.253
how important it is...

18:49.922 --> 18:51.691
what you've got.

19:03.970 --> 19:05.470
<i>Professor McFarland?</i>

19:05.504 --> 19:07.339
<i>Yes, what is it?</i>

19:07.372 --> 19:09.976
<i>My name is Ellis and this is Harry
Jarvis. We're from the Morning Chronicle.</i>

19:10.009 --> 19:12.377
<i>I wonder we could come in for...</i>

19:12.410 --> 19:13.679
<i>I am rather busy.</i>

20:48.107 --> 20:49.775
Something's changed.

20:51.744 --> 20:54.613
Um, no. No, nothing's changed.

20:55.715 --> 20:57.116
Oh, yeah, I can see it.

20:59.451 --> 21:01.187
I've been getting to know you
for a month now, Jake.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.990
You can't hide easily
from me now.

21:04.023 --> 21:06.158
I'm not hiding.
What are you talking about?

21:06.192 --> 21:08.127
It's not Macy.

21:10.830 --> 21:12.932
There's a new girl, isn't there?

21:12.965 --> 21:15.134
No, no. There's no new girl...

21:16.035 --> 21:17.770
Why are your walls this color?

21:19.839 --> 21:22.875
Not my decision.

21:22.909 --> 21:24.877
I was twenty-four once too,
okay?

21:24.911 --> 21:27.213
And I know what it's like
to be young and in love.

21:27.246 --> 21:29.849
Yeah, but you don't know what
it's like to be me and in love.

21:29.882 --> 21:32.484
Okay... that's fair.

21:37.089 --> 21:39.692
But that is why you're here.

21:40.960 --> 21:45.131
And I can only help you if you are
completely open and honest with me, okay?

21:49.567 --> 21:51.603
You want to tell me about her?

21:56.842 --> 21:57.977
What's her name?

22:01.546 --> 22:03.182
We've got a big group coming in!

22:03.215 --> 22:05.217
Sweet sixteen party.

22:05.251 --> 22:08.553
Gonna be a ton of little ladies
celebrating their special friend.

22:10.622 --> 22:12.058
Gonna need you to suit up!

23:42.882 --> 23:45.251
Looking good!

23:48.220 --> 23:50.656
Hey.
Meet our newest staff member.

23:51.924 --> 23:53.259
Hey.

23:53.292 --> 23:55.828
It's nice to meet you,
Roger Rabbit!

23:55.861 --> 23:59.564
- Oh, no, I'm...
- Oh! No, he's Roller Rabbit.

24:00.966 --> 24:02.868
Yeah, I'm the Roller Rabbit.

24:06.238 --> 24:09.275
No, I'm... I'm not the
Roller Rabbit. I'm... I'm Jake.

24:09.308 --> 24:11.877
This is the Roller Rabbit. Um...

24:13.179 --> 24:15.948
Hey, where's your nose,
Rabbit nose?

24:15.981 --> 24:18.150
Hmm? Hmm? Put it on!

24:19.151 --> 24:21.687
- It's right here. Yeah.
- There you go.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.723
And then come along
and get out there!

24:24.757 --> 24:26.792
- Rolling around!
- It was nice to meet you, Jake.

24:26.826 --> 24:28.861
It was nice to meet you too.

24:31.197 --> 24:34.100
Oh, sweetheart!
Let me introduce you to Bazel!

25:08.968 --> 25:12.838
Sucks being over here alone,
man. You look like shit.

25:12.872 --> 25:15.207
Dude, I just had
the most amazing day.

25:15.241 --> 25:17.376
- Really?
- Yeah!

25:17.409 --> 25:18.978
Yeah, I mean...

25:20.179 --> 25:23.949
I mean, running out of gum.
That's pretty awful. Right?

25:23.983 --> 25:27.419
And then having to wear this
all day and talk to people.

25:27.453 --> 25:31.290
That's pretty bad, right?
But you know what, I finally met her.

25:31.323 --> 25:32.791
Oh, you mean the new girl,
Sherry?

25:32.825 --> 25:35.861
Yeah, yeah,
I mean, she's like...

25:35.895 --> 25:37.463
- Have you met her?
- Yeah.

25:37.496 --> 25:39.965
Bitchell introduced us
when he was showing her around.

25:39.999 --> 25:41.133
She seems pretty cool.

25:45.037 --> 25:46.972
Pretty cool, dude! She's...

25:49.775 --> 25:51.810
She knows famous rabbits
and stuff.

25:51.844 --> 25:52.845
What?

25:54.480 --> 25:57.016
Nothing.

25:57.049 --> 26:00.052
I was supposed to come in early tomorrow
to give her the rolling welcome tour.

26:00.085 --> 26:01.387
Mitchell asked you to do that?

26:01.420 --> 26:03.989
Yeah! Surprised me too.

26:04.023 --> 26:08.294
I was gonna do it. Get her to fall
in love with me. Make Anna jealous.

26:08.327 --> 26:12.231
But seeing as you actually like
her, I think you should do it, man.

26:12.264 --> 26:13.899
Really?

26:13.933 --> 26:16.101
When was the last time
you had a girlfriend?

26:16.135 --> 26:18.837
- Or even talked to a girl?
- Well...

26:18.871 --> 26:20.406
That didn't work here.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.377
- Mind helping me with the rest?
- Sure, dude.

26:42.328 --> 26:44.263
Where is my phone?

26:44.296 --> 26:47.399
Oh, my God.
Just relax okay. I'll call you.

26:47.433 --> 26:51.170
- Jake! Jake!
- Where did you last see it?

26:51.203 --> 26:54.139
Holy balls!
Where is my phone!

26:54.173 --> 26:56.942
Um, I, I don't know
where your phone is.

26:56.976 --> 26:58.510
I'm calling!

27:12.891 --> 27:14.360
Really?

27:14.393 --> 27:17.396
Well, it happens to all of us
at some point...

27:17.429 --> 27:20.065
- No.
- ...in our lives.

27:22.901 --> 27:26.338
Oh, babe. You have got to relax.

27:26.372 --> 27:29.441
I'm trying! You know how
much this promotion means.

27:29.475 --> 27:30.909
I know, I know.

27:33.412 --> 27:35.214
If you're already
this stressed out,

27:35.247 --> 27:37.283
a job with more responsibility
is not going to make it better.

27:38.450 --> 27:44.823
No, but that paycheck
is going to be huge!

27:44.857 --> 27:48.227
And those hours!
Man, those hours.

27:48.260 --> 27:50.829
- Sweetie.
- No more getting up early.

27:50.863 --> 27:53.332
- Erica.
- No more staying up late!

27:53.365 --> 27:54.533
Babe. Babe.

27:55.735 --> 28:00.572
You are going to do great. Okay?
They're going to love you.

28:00.606 --> 28:03.609
You just need to be you.

28:03.643 --> 28:06.445
- You're right.
- I know I'm right!

28:24.563 --> 28:26.832
Hello, is this Ms. Rheiner?

28:28.668 --> 28:30.569
How are you doing today,
Ms. Rheiner?

28:32.104 --> 28:35.474
Um, I'm doing good, thank you.
Um...

28:35.507 --> 28:38.544
I'm calling today about
your results from last week.

28:40.079 --> 28:42.381
Yeah.
Yeah, we got it back already.

28:43.415 --> 28:45.250
Oh...

28:45.284 --> 28:49.121
Well, I regret to inform you
that it came back positive.

28:50.489 --> 28:51.390
Yes.

28:55.961 --> 28:57.129
Oh, it's um...

28:58.631 --> 29:00.132
adenocarcinoma.

29:03.636 --> 29:04.603
The lungs.

29:26.693 --> 29:28.494
Ms. Rheiner, I hate to interrupt

29:28.527 --> 29:32.297
but I do have to get on with my
calls for the rest of the day.

29:32.331 --> 29:34.066
Um...

29:34.099 --> 29:36.468
I'll be sending you
a quick email in a few moments

29:36.502 --> 29:39.204
- asking you of how our service has been with us.
- <i>What?</i>

29:39.238 --> 29:42.474
If you can go ahead and mark us
down as five stars. Um...

29:42.508 --> 29:45.611
Anything less and it actually
counts against us.

29:45.645 --> 29:49.948
I want to thank you for using
CancerQuick as your diagnostic provider.

29:49.982 --> 29:52.484
Uh, if you have any other
questions or concerns.

29:52.518 --> 29:57.690
You can call us 24/7, um, at our
complimentary customer service hotline.

29:57.724 --> 30:01.326
Thank you so much. Uh, bye-bye.

31:36.388 --> 31:39.391
Hey, Macy.
What are you doing here?

31:39.424 --> 31:40.760
Javier gave me keys.

31:40.793 --> 31:43.529
I'm just getting an early start!

31:44.764 --> 31:46.633
Getting started on what?

31:46.666 --> 31:48.267
Um...

31:49.334 --> 31:53.305
My drawings! I am just working
on my drawings!

31:54.874 --> 31:57.576
Cool. Um, can you...

31:57.609 --> 31:59.779
Oh, yeah! Of course!

31:59.812 --> 32:01.280
- Thanks.
- Go right ahead!

32:01.313 --> 32:05.050
Thank you!

32:06.218 --> 32:08.453
I'm just going to put
my stuff up real quick.

32:08.487 --> 32:09.388
Okay.

32:56.435 --> 32:59.438
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

32:59.471 --> 33:03.308
There's so much history in here.
It's beautiful.

33:03.342 --> 33:05.444
- ]
- Yeah.

33:05.477 --> 33:08.715
Yeah, it's beautiful. Hey,
I don't want to get fired! Can we leave?

33:08.748 --> 33:11.350
Come on! Don't be nervous.

33:41.246 --> 33:42.782
Is that him?

33:42.815 --> 33:45.317
Yeah, that's him.

33:45.350 --> 33:46.919
Does he look the same?

33:46.953 --> 33:48.855
Uh, kind of.

33:48.888 --> 33:50.757
He's like a hundred years old now.
He's bald.

33:50.790 --> 33:54.393
- Oh, my God, those shorts!
- Yeah.

34:01.968 --> 34:03.770
Been around the world.

34:03.803 --> 34:06.839
He has.
He's done so many things.

34:06.873 --> 34:11.410
Triathlons, skating tournaments,
coaching champs.

34:11.443 --> 34:13.913
Champions of skating?

34:13.946 --> 34:15.748
National champs.

34:15.782 --> 34:17.382
Is there such a thing?

34:17.416 --> 34:19.584
Oh... Oh, yeah!

34:19.618 --> 34:21.420
Don't let anybody else hear you
asking that.

34:21.453 --> 34:22.989
Especially not Luther.

34:23.022 --> 34:26.693
Oh... you look up to him.

34:26.726 --> 34:28.928
I mean, he's a respectable guy.

34:30.295 --> 34:32.397
He built a legacy from nothing.

34:32.431 --> 34:33.598
From passion.

34:34.533 --> 34:35.935
Is that what you want to do?

34:36.869 --> 34:38.303
Build a legacy?

34:43.843 --> 34:46.578
Uh, obviously, you can read.
Skate shop!

34:48.715 --> 34:50.917
They have a lot of things for sale.
I don't really understand.

34:52.451 --> 34:53.953
Um...

34:53.986 --> 34:57.824
Snack bar! That's where
the rink rats hang out...

34:57.857 --> 35:00.559
Uh, over here we have
the restrooms!

35:00.592 --> 35:04.563
We have... arcade and lockers.

35:04.596 --> 35:08.801
And way down there is
where people rent their skates.

35:08.835 --> 35:12.004
Seems like a pretty
magical place to work.

35:12.038 --> 35:14.339
- All the lights and everything.
- Yeah.

35:14.372 --> 35:16.876
I mean, I wouldn't say magical
because Brandon and Mitchell exist.

35:16.909 --> 35:19.344
- Oh, he's not that bad!
- Brandon? Yeah, he's alright.

35:19.377 --> 35:21.513
- No! Mitchell!
- Oh.

35:22.614 --> 35:25.017
Well, maybe once you work with him
long enough you will change your mind.

35:27.720 --> 35:28.721
Um...

35:30.455 --> 35:33.558
- Come on, last part of the tour.
- Oh?

35:41.868 --> 35:44.837
What is this?
What are you doing?

35:44.871 --> 35:46.471
Oh, sorry! I just, um...

36:18.037 --> 36:20.539
Hey. Are you ready?

36:20.572 --> 36:22.842
- Uh, I don't think I am.
- Come on.

36:59.078 --> 37:00.646
Can I tell you something?

37:00.680 --> 37:01.948
Yeah, sure.

37:04.750 --> 37:07.119
You kind of have a grandma name.

37:07.153 --> 37:09.889
- What?
- Yeah, it's pretty grannyesque.

37:09.922 --> 37:13.025
It's like right behind Shirlie
for top grandma name.

37:14.794 --> 37:17.063
Wait, wait, it's second
in the ranking of grandma names?

37:17.096 --> 37:18.965
Yeah, number two.

37:18.998 --> 37:24.569
I'd say top five are Shirlie,
Sherry, Gladys, Bertha and uh...

37:26.672 --> 37:28.573
Um, Patty?

37:28.607 --> 37:29.775
Patty?

37:29.809 --> 37:31.443
Yeah.

37:31.476 --> 37:32.945
Grandma Patty.
Alright, yeah, I can see that.

37:32.979 --> 37:34.981
Maybe not top five
but definitely up there.

37:35.014 --> 37:37.683
Oh, God.

39:25.291 --> 39:26.726
Hey!

39:26.759 --> 39:28.526
Hey! You're getting better!

39:28.560 --> 39:31.230
Uh, I don't know.
I'm alright, um...

39:33.132 --> 39:35.901
I... I still don't really know
how to turn or how to stop

39:35.935 --> 39:38.804
or how to start
without somebody pushing me.

39:38.838 --> 39:42.708
But, um, yeah, I guess
I'm getting better.

39:45.277 --> 39:47.013
- So...
- What?

39:47.046 --> 39:48.848
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, I... You were talking first.

39:48.881 --> 39:51.183
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

39:51.217 --> 39:53.152
No, no, it's okay. Go ahead.

39:53.185 --> 39:56.588
Um... What are you doing here?

39:56.621 --> 39:57.289
Um...

39:59.892 --> 40:03.561
I'm just chilling.

40:03.595 --> 40:05.998
- You're just chilling?
- Yeah, just taking a break.

40:06.032 --> 40:08.868
Wait, I, I didn't think
we were allowed to have breaks?

40:08.901 --> 40:11.237
- Oh, we can't!
- Oh?

40:11.270 --> 40:13.773
Yeah, Mitchell says if he sees us taking
breaks, he's going to start breaking legs.

40:13.806 --> 40:15.941
That's a little dramatic!

40:15.975 --> 40:18.110
Yeah... but...

40:20.112 --> 40:23.049
What he doesn't know is I've
actually learned his routine.

40:23.983 --> 40:29.155
At exactly 7 p.m. every single day,
he heats up this big nasty-looking burrito.

40:29.188 --> 40:33.692
After taking three minutes and twenty-three
seconds to eat, he sits back in his chair

40:33.726 --> 40:36.328
and he rubs his belly for about
ten to fifteen seconds.

40:36.362 --> 40:38.931
Ten to fifteen seconds?

40:38.964 --> 40:42.368
Yeah. I've narrowed it down
to satisfaction.

40:42.401 --> 40:45.071
Mm-Hm.

40:45.104 --> 40:48.074
If he likes the burrito like a normal person
like a burrito, he only rubs for ten seconds.

40:48.107 --> 40:54.847
But if the burrito that day was particularly
satisfying, he rubs for up to fifteen seconds.

40:54.880 --> 40:59.051
After that, he rushes to the restroom
faster than I've ever seen him move.

40:59.085 --> 41:01.586
And he's in there
for about an hour.

41:03.322 --> 41:05.324
Wow! That's, um...

41:05.357 --> 41:07.960
Yeah.

41:07.993 --> 41:13.399
So, we have an hour without Mitchell every
single day and you're just now telling me!

41:13.432 --> 41:16.335
It's true.

41:19.238 --> 41:21.974
Some of us are going
to be going out next week.

41:23.008 --> 41:25.111
It'd be cool if you came.

41:25.144 --> 41:26.579
Going out?

41:26.611 --> 41:28.848
Yeah, I don't know I guess I just
thought it would be cool to hang out,

41:28.881 --> 41:31.951
you know, outside of this place.

41:36.255 --> 41:38.090
- Yeah, yeah, okay!
- Yeah?

41:38.124 --> 41:40.659
- Yeah, sure! Great!
- Great! Awesome!

41:41.393 --> 41:43.729
- Well, cool.
- Yeah. Yeah, oh.

41:54.106 --> 41:56.742
Yep. Yeah.

41:59.178 --> 42:00.713
No.

42:00.746 --> 42:02.748
Here's a thought.

42:02.781 --> 42:05.017
Mm?

42:05.050 --> 42:09.321
Now, you're uncomfortable getting close
to people, right? Especially women.

42:09.355 --> 42:11.790
Yeah.

42:11.824 --> 42:16.228
But you live with two young and I'm...
I'm guessing, attractive females.

42:16.262 --> 42:19.098
Yeah, but that's not
what it sounds like.

42:19.131 --> 42:22.868
What are you talking about, man?
That's like every guy's fantasy.

42:24.803 --> 42:27.306
They're not into me.

42:27.339 --> 42:29.775
So?

42:29.808 --> 42:33.145
Well, they might not be now but you
live under the same roof long enough.

42:33.179 --> 42:35.014
Something's bound to happen
with one of them.

42:35.047 --> 42:37.383
No, Sean. They're together.

42:40.819 --> 42:42.922
I don't, I don't...

42:42.955 --> 42:44.056
Um...

42:48.861 --> 42:50.429
They're together.

42:52.031 --> 42:53.999
- Okay.
- Yeah.

42:54.033 --> 42:56.902
Well. Even better, man!

43:03.275 --> 43:07.446
Do you, uh... Do you talk to
anyone as much as you talk to me?

43:07.479 --> 43:08.881
No.

43:10.149 --> 43:11.350
Why not?

43:12.785 --> 43:14.453
I don't really have anyone.

43:14.486 --> 43:17.756
Sure, you do. You got, uh...

43:17.790 --> 43:20.859
You got Ben, you got William.
You got the lesbian twins.

43:20.893 --> 43:24.296
Ben and William just have me around to
test their new guide before they try it.

43:24.330 --> 43:26.365
And they're not twins!
They're together.

43:26.398 --> 43:30.502
They just let me live with them
because it's like I don't exist.

43:30.536 --> 43:32.004
Okay, don't say that.

43:32.037 --> 43:33.539
No, no, no!
That's what they say.

43:33.572 --> 43:35.874
They say, "Hey, Jake,
great to have you around.

43:35.908 --> 43:38.010
We don't even know when you're here.
It's like you don't exist."

43:47.319 --> 43:49.421
Why won't you talk
about your family.

43:54.193 --> 43:55.861
That's not why we're here.

43:55.894 --> 43:57.963
Well, I think that if we talked
about them, then...

43:57.997 --> 44:00.165
I'm here so you can make me feel
like a normal person.

44:00.199 --> 44:03.202
Okay, why are you so stuck on that, huh?
What? Being normal?

44:03.235 --> 44:06.238
- What?
- What... Why do you even care?

44:06.272 --> 44:08.340
Are you kidding me?

44:08.374 --> 44:10.576
Why would I be here if I didn't
want to feel like a normal person?

44:10.609 --> 44:12.878
I don't know, you tell me.
And what is normal?

44:12.911 --> 44:13.979
I don't know what normal is!

44:14.947 --> 44:15.848
Uh...

44:16.949 --> 44:18.685
Someone who... who talks
to people without feeling

44:18.718 --> 44:23.422
like they're going to fall into some sorry
useless puddle that everyone wants to step on.

44:30.963 --> 44:34.900
How can everyone go out into the world
and then feel like it's all okay?

44:34.933 --> 44:37.136
It's all okay! It's not okay!

44:41.940 --> 44:43.375
Why is it not okay?

44:45.010 --> 44:48.314
Because you have people on this side of
the spectrum judging people on this side.

44:48.347 --> 44:51.483
And if... by God,
if you're not on one side.

44:51.517 --> 44:55.988
If you're like kind of caught in the middle.
You're teetering, right, back and forth.

44:57.189 --> 44:59.325
Then you're just going
to live a sorry life.

45:04.096 --> 45:08.467
Look. I know you don't want to talk
about your family. No, I get that.

45:10.436 --> 45:12.604
Hey, you want to change
your life, don't you?

45:14.206 --> 45:15.474
That's why I'm here.

45:17.209 --> 45:21.413
Now if we don't talk about your family, we'll
never get past this. It's called closure.

45:21.447 --> 45:24.651
We have to address this
at some point, Jake. Jake!

45:24.684 --> 45:27.019
Stop just for a second!

45:27.052 --> 45:30.222
If we don't address this, Jake!

45:30.255 --> 45:31.557
Jake!

45:33.292 --> 45:34.360
Jake!

45:43.035 --> 45:44.136
Sorry.

46:04.556 --> 46:06.925
He'll come back.
Don't stress about it.

46:08.728 --> 46:11.698
I used to get upset
at the old man all the time.

46:11.731 --> 46:13.232
We turned out okay.

46:15.067 --> 46:17.169
I don't know.

46:17.202 --> 46:19.104
Never seen him
this upset before.

46:20.439 --> 46:22.007
He's got a temper?

46:22.040 --> 46:24.042
I don't know,
he won't talk about it.

46:26.578 --> 46:30.916
- But I know something's there.
- Got to just keep digging, huh?

46:33.419 --> 46:35.254
You know, we didn't talk
for weeks after the accident.

46:35.287 --> 46:38.090
James, please.

46:39.358 --> 46:41.493
We blamed each other probably
as much as we blamed ourselves.

46:41.527 --> 46:43.495
No one wants to hear about this.

46:43.529 --> 46:45.030
Let me finish.

46:45.063 --> 46:46.532
Hey, you don't have
to go into this.

46:46.565 --> 46:49.468
- We don't need to talk!
- It was 15 years ago, dad!

46:51.738 --> 46:54.707
If you don't want to talk
about it, you don't have to!

46:56.542 --> 46:58.277
I've got something to say!

47:02.347 --> 47:04.249
All she needed was a drive home.

47:07.186 --> 47:08.287
He was passed out drunk.

47:11.223 --> 47:13.959
I was hanging out with friends.
It was just a regular night.

47:15.294 --> 47:16.995
She called me about four times.

47:18.096 --> 47:19.699
Texted me I don't know
how many times.

47:27.439 --> 47:30.576
On the last call,
I answered all irritated.

47:34.681 --> 47:36.315
I told her to call dad.

47:37.583 --> 47:39.151
And I hung up on her.

47:42.689 --> 47:44.356
Obviously, he didn't pick up.

47:51.396 --> 47:54.701
We decided that our... our plans
were more important that night.

47:57.302 --> 48:00.072
And so far, it's cost us
the last 15 years with her.

48:00.105 --> 48:02.508
- It's not your fault.
- Yeah, I know that.

48:05.210 --> 48:06.445
And it's not yours.

48:12.785 --> 48:14.219
But that's what I'm trying
to say.

48:15.287 --> 48:17.155
I mean, who knows
what's going on with this kid?

48:18.524 --> 48:22.227
He's probably confused
and he might be blaming himself.

48:29.636 --> 48:31.403
So, what's the issue with him?

48:36.809 --> 48:38.110
It's hard to tell.

48:39.278 --> 48:41.781
- Still trying to figure it out.
- Oh, well, there you go.

48:43.382 --> 48:44.416
Easy.

48:46.585 --> 48:50.422
I'm doing the best I can with
the information I have, okay?

48:52.692 --> 48:56.094
Besides, who do I have to go to
when I have questions, huh?

48:56.128 --> 48:57.362
You tell me.

48:58.731 --> 49:00.800
People go to you looking for
answers, not the other way around.

49:00.833 --> 49:03.168
No, no, no, no, no.
Hang on a second.

49:03.201 --> 49:06.773
Who do I have to go to when I
have questions, huh? Tell me!

49:07.707 --> 49:11.610
When I have things that I need to sort
out, who do I have to go to?

49:11.644 --> 49:13.278
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah, I really do!

49:13.312 --> 49:14.446
- Yeah?
- Yeah, really!

49:14.479 --> 49:15.380
No one!

49:20.419 --> 49:21.788
That's the truth.

49:24.156 --> 49:25.357
It's just you, bud.

49:27.660 --> 49:28.828
It's just you.

49:33.398 --> 49:35.300
You know when that boy lost
his mother...

49:36.602 --> 49:38.236
when I lost my wife...

49:39.438 --> 49:41.473
I didn't have anyone to go to.

49:43.876 --> 49:46.244
But the negativity stops at us!

49:47.512 --> 49:48.547
Okay?

49:49.749 --> 49:50.783
You know why?

49:53.452 --> 49:55.621
It's 'cause that's the burden
of being a father.

49:59.324 --> 50:03.128
You may not actually be one but
you damn sure are to that kid.

53:08.648 --> 53:09.882
Come on, dude.

53:41.714 --> 53:42.849
Hey!

57:32.344 --> 57:37.316
Jake did not tell me that we'd be in
the presence of such company tonight.

57:37.349 --> 57:39.952
We're not going to help you
with your guide, Ben.

57:41.387 --> 57:43.089
Don't even try, Ben.

57:48.894 --> 57:52.364
Alright, my dudes and dudettes. I've got
three simple rules for you guys, alright?

57:52.398 --> 57:54.266
No running, okay, guys?

57:54.300 --> 57:56.402
The vest will turn itself off
if you do that.

57:56.435 --> 57:58.871
Number two,
do not hit each other, alright?

57:58.904 --> 58:01.407
I know you guys are friends,
but this is not Call of Duty.

58:01.440 --> 58:05.111
Do not run around like it's Battle
Royale hitting each other, okay, guys?

58:05.144 --> 58:08.047
And rule number three,
just have fun, alright, guys?

58:52.858 --> 58:54.260
Where's Jake?

58:54.293 --> 58:55.728
We're getting slaughtered!

58:56.996 --> 58:58.364
Jake, let's go!

59:00.933 --> 59:01.867
Take it slow!

59:02.768 --> 59:04.837
He needs to get here.

59:04.870 --> 59:06.138
Come on, Jake!

59:06.172 --> 59:07.940
Where is he?

59:07.973 --> 59:09.241
Got us pinned down!

59:10.442 --> 59:12.077
They're murdering us,
dude.

59:16.448 --> 59:17.750
Come on, Jake.

59:39.471 --> 59:41.307
Come on, dude!

59:41.340 --> 59:42.441
What?

59:42.474 --> 59:43.776
Are you kidding?

1:01:47.599 --> 1:01:49.168
Sherry?

1:01:49.201 --> 1:01:50.536
You dropped...

1:01:53.205 --> 1:01:56.175
- You dropped this.
- Oh, thanks.

1:02:19.298 --> 1:02:21.033
So, you know,

1:02:21.066 --> 1:02:22.669
- if you had to describe me...
- Stop talking!

1:02:22.702 --> 1:02:24.336
- ...in three vegetables...
- What's up, man?

1:02:24.370 --> 1:02:26.238
Uh, not much.

1:02:28.574 --> 1:02:29.575
Hey! I've seen you.

1:02:31.343 --> 1:02:35.347
Yeah! You always come here
and get the same stuff.

1:02:35.381 --> 1:02:38.016
- Shove it, Brandon!
- I'm just saying.

1:02:38.050 --> 1:02:39.151
It's cool, man.

1:02:42.621 --> 1:02:44.223
Ignore him, he's an idiot.

1:02:44.256 --> 1:02:45.591
- I'm an idiot?
- Yeah.

1:02:45.624 --> 1:02:47.359
- Yeah!
- What makes... I know.

1:02:47.393 --> 1:02:49.495
- This guy comes in...
- Stop talking!

1:02:49.528 --> 1:02:51.698
- ...three times a week and buys three packs of ramen!
- Shut up!

1:02:51.731 --> 1:02:54.066
You, Sir! Would you like
a well-groomed zucchini up your...

1:02:54.099 --> 1:02:55.567
Just bag the groceries.

1:02:57.536 --> 1:03:00.005
Just because I've
observed the fact that this man

1:03:00.038 --> 1:03:04.009
buys three different types of shapes
of zucchini, doesn't make me an idiot.

1:03:04.042 --> 1:03:06.211
In fact, it makes me
the opposite of an idiot.

1:03:06.245 --> 1:03:09.114
- If anything, I'm the smartest person...
- Excuse me, um...

1:03:09.148 --> 1:03:12.484
- Is there a problem here?
- No! Hey, Mitchy, how are you doing?

1:03:13.552 --> 1:03:15.053
What did I tell you
about calling me that?

1:03:17.690 --> 1:03:20.392
That's right! Now quit flapping your
yap, start bagging your sack.

1:03:23.028 --> 1:03:24.463
Let's go! Get to work!

1:03:27.232 --> 1:03:29.368
Give it to him.
Here you go, Sir.

1:03:29.401 --> 1:03:30.536
Good.

1:03:33.005 --> 1:03:34.440
Come again.

1:03:34.473 --> 1:03:36.074
See you tomorrow.

1:03:36.108 --> 1:03:38.043
- Side note...
- Would you shut up and get back to work.

1:03:38.076 --> 1:03:40.979
All of you please. Thank you.

1:03:41.013 --> 1:03:42.247
Cleaned up.

1:08:29.635 --> 1:08:32.504
- Hi. I'm Alex.
- Two things, kid.

1:08:32.537 --> 1:08:34.974
Don't be so eager
and don't say "um."

1:08:35.007 --> 1:08:36.642
Makes you sound like an amateur.

1:08:36.676 --> 1:08:38.678
I'm sitting next to you tonight.

1:08:38.711 --> 1:08:41.681
- So, that's not going to happen.
- Okay.

1:08:44.851 --> 1:08:46.451
My name's Michael.

1:08:46.485 --> 1:08:47.987
You can call me M-Dog.

1:08:48.020 --> 1:08:49.588
I've been judging since '94.

1:08:49.621 --> 1:08:52.457
- Cool.
- Yeah, damn right that's cool.

1:08:52.491 --> 1:08:54.994
You got one hell
of a Kung Fu grip there, kid.

1:08:55.027 --> 1:08:56.729
- Thanks.
- Karate?

1:08:56.763 --> 1:09:00.499
No. I just, uh, work out.

1:09:00.532 --> 1:09:03.636
Yeah, I remember my days
at the dojo.

1:09:03.669 --> 1:09:06.304
Best in class.
Four years straight.

1:09:06.338 --> 1:09:09.441
That must've been a long,
long time ago.

1:09:09.474 --> 1:09:12.712
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- Hey, rookie.

1:09:12.745 --> 1:09:14.847
- You mind?
- Um...

1:09:15.882 --> 1:09:17.917
Sure.

1:09:17.950 --> 1:09:21.353
Hey, kid. I guess they'll let
anybody judge these days, huh?

1:09:21.386 --> 1:09:24.957
I guess there's only going
to be one real judge here today.

1:09:24.991 --> 1:09:26.591
No offense, kid.

1:09:26.626 --> 1:09:29.494
No, it's cool.
I'm just, uh, here to learn.

1:09:29.528 --> 1:09:33.565
Well, you're learning from the best
derby girl this side of Lewisville.

1:09:33.598 --> 1:09:36.702
Wait a minute, are you telling
me that you're Robin Regal?

1:09:36.736 --> 1:09:39.371
- The Robin Regal.
- What the hell is a Robin Regal?

1:09:39.404 --> 1:09:41.406
Last time I checked.

1:09:41.439 --> 1:09:45.678
And now I am judging the local
competitions that put me on the map.

1:09:45.711 --> 1:09:49.548
I'd offer you some of my liquid
courage, but uh... Yeah.

1:09:56.722 --> 1:09:57.990
Let's judge!

1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:56.662
So, I was going to talk to you
about dating this girl named Daphne.

1:13:56.695 --> 1:13:59.365
And she is capital D Daphne,
know what I mean?

1:13:59.398 --> 1:14:01.834
Really nice looking.
And I've had a great time with her.

1:14:01.867 --> 1:14:05.237
She's funny, she's smart,
she's nice and the sex is pow!

1:14:05.271 --> 1:14:06.571
I mean, it is on.

1:14:06.604 --> 1:14:08.707
Then all of the sudden she starts
asking for all these gifts.

1:14:08.741 --> 1:14:11.310
We're talking rings, dresses,
even a car at some point.

1:14:11.343 --> 1:14:12.912
Now, we're not talking
about some cheap Buick.

1:14:12.945 --> 1:14:14.146
We're talking about
a really nice Mercedes.

1:14:15.414 --> 1:14:16.749
Hey, Jake.

1:14:17.783 --> 1:14:20.853
- Uh, I can come back later.
- No, no, no, stay.

1:14:22.121 --> 1:14:24.123
- We're just wrapping up.
- Oh, we, we are?

1:14:24.156 --> 1:14:27.193
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay. Thanks, Dr. Gamsy.

1:14:27.226 --> 1:14:28.727
You did good today, Thomas.

1:14:30.863 --> 1:14:32.264
We'll see you next week?
2 o'clock?

1:14:32.298 --> 1:14:33.632
I'll be here, right.

1:14:39.338 --> 1:14:40.239
Well....

1:14:41.974 --> 1:14:43.275
You gonna stand there all day?

1:14:52.284 --> 1:14:54.186
I thought you didn't like to be
called doctor?

1:14:54.220 --> 1:14:56.255
I said you didn't have
to call me doctor.

1:14:57.156 --> 1:14:59.258
I let people call me
what they want.

1:14:59.291 --> 1:15:00.693
Come on in.

1:15:08.434 --> 1:15:10.136
I'm glad to see you're back.

1:15:11.904 --> 1:15:13.005
What's going on?

1:15:16.909 --> 1:15:18.277
I'm done with InterSkate.

1:15:20.212 --> 1:15:21.247
Okay.

1:15:23.315 --> 1:15:24.683
What happened?

1:15:26.986 --> 1:15:28.187
I'm not happy.

1:15:30.789 --> 1:15:31.957
You know...

1:15:33.125 --> 1:15:36.962
No matter how hard I try to make it
real, it's never real.

1:15:37.997 --> 1:15:40.266
It's never been real, it's...

1:15:40.299 --> 1:15:41.834
it's always been me.

1:15:41.867 --> 1:15:43.102
Just me.

1:15:49.241 --> 1:15:50.276
Okay.

1:15:51.243 --> 1:15:52.978
Okay.

1:15:53.012 --> 1:15:54.847
Now we're getting somewhere.

1:15:57.316 --> 1:15:58.350
Talk to me.

1:16:00.753 --> 1:16:01.787
What happened?

1:16:18.504 --> 1:16:19.905
Oh, shh!

1:16:20.906 --> 1:16:22.308
Shh!

1:16:22.341 --> 1:16:25.110
- Come on, go to bed.
- You have a kid?

1:16:25.144 --> 1:16:30.482
Uh, yeah, I mean, he's super
quiet and you won't even know he's here.

1:16:32.484 --> 1:16:34.153
- Mom, I painted you something, look!
- What?

1:16:36.222 --> 1:16:37.122
Oh, God.

1:16:39.425 --> 1:16:41.293
- Hey!
- Go to bed!

1:17:05.951 --> 1:17:07.853
She became a very mean person.

1:17:13.525 --> 1:17:15.294
She called me a psycho...

1:17:16.862 --> 1:17:18.163
when I'd lose my temper.

1:17:26.071 --> 1:17:29.208
There was always a different guy
trying to call himself my dad.

1:17:32.878 --> 1:17:35.080
She'd invite the filthiest
people into our home.

1:17:35.114 --> 1:17:36.782
And they'd treat us
like garbage.

1:17:45.624 --> 1:17:47.860
She'd come home after work,
late.

1:17:48.594 --> 1:17:52.231
And I'd have to help her walk
because she'd be stumbling.

1:17:54.300 --> 1:17:57.136
I'd hold her hair back
while she threw up in our tub.

1:18:03.575 --> 1:18:04.877
Eventually I...

1:18:05.577 --> 1:18:07.379
moved in with family
and friends...

1:18:08.414 --> 1:18:10.115
bouncing from place to place.

1:18:20.059 --> 1:18:21.093
Anyway...

1:18:22.928 --> 1:18:24.229
Hey!

1:18:27.032 --> 1:18:29.234
What are you doing...

1:18:29.268 --> 1:18:31.170
right now?

1:18:31.203 --> 1:18:32.304
Nothing.

1:18:34.573 --> 1:18:35.941
Let's go get a cocktail.

1:18:36.676 --> 1:18:39.111
- I don't...
- I know!

1:18:39.144 --> 1:18:40.579
It's okay.

1:18:40.612 --> 1:18:42.047
You can watch me.

1:18:54.293 --> 1:18:55.394
You enjoying that?

1:18:56.995 --> 1:18:59.431
Yes! Uh, I like it very much.
Thank you.

1:19:03.369 --> 1:19:04.470
2%?

1:19:06.405 --> 1:19:08.107
I do not know.

1:19:11.543 --> 1:19:14.313
- Circus of freaks.
- You ain't lying.

1:19:16.181 --> 1:19:20.219
You know, Little Luke here
was the best man at my wedding.

1:19:20.252 --> 1:19:21.920
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.

1:19:21.954 --> 1:19:23.055
That's awesome.

1:19:23.989 --> 1:19:27.025
Yeah. He's good people.

1:19:27.059 --> 1:19:28.327
So is this clown right here.

1:19:31.096 --> 1:19:32.931
I don't think
I'll ever get married.

1:19:33.666 --> 1:19:35.100
Yeah? Why's that?

1:19:36.602 --> 1:19:39.505
I don't know if somebody would like
me enough to stay around that long.

1:19:42.441 --> 1:19:44.476
I don't know if I'd like
somebody that much either.

1:19:45.712 --> 1:19:47.413
Now, that's crazy talk.

1:19:48.815 --> 1:19:52.618
So, you're telling me that out of
billions of people in this world...

1:19:53.986 --> 1:19:57.256
that you don't think there's
anyone out there for you.

1:19:57.289 --> 1:19:59.925
I think a lot of people
just die alone.

1:20:02.394 --> 1:20:05.230
Yeah, yeah, I get that. But...

1:20:07.399 --> 1:20:09.568
I guarantee you,
nobody wanted to.

1:20:13.305 --> 1:20:14.973
But you know what happened,
right?

1:20:19.344 --> 1:20:21.513
They just didn't take the...

1:20:21.547 --> 1:20:23.683
the risk
that every one of us did.

1:20:28.721 --> 1:20:30.956
The risk to fall in love.

1:20:35.260 --> 1:20:36.495
I'll drink to that.

1:20:37.764 --> 1:20:39.965
- To love.
- To love.

1:20:59.786 --> 1:21:02.054
Jake, you needed me?

1:21:02.087 --> 1:21:05.057
Um, yeah, just one moment.

1:21:05.090 --> 1:21:07.526
Are you really doing that
on work time?

1:21:09.796 --> 1:21:11.230
Yes.

1:21:12.832 --> 1:21:17.202
I could write you up with a code four
disciplinary referral, do you know that?

1:21:17.236 --> 1:21:18.570
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1:21:21.240 --> 1:21:22.274
Jake.

1:21:24.576 --> 1:21:26.011
Jake!

1:21:29.414 --> 1:21:33.285
Actually, uh, there was something
I wanted to talk to you about.

1:21:33.318 --> 1:21:38.290
Um, and I think your office
would be a better place.

1:22:36.381 --> 1:22:37.482
Enter.

1:22:42.922 --> 1:22:44.122
Well...

1:22:45.490 --> 1:22:48.160
Look who learned how to knock
before entering a room.

1:22:51.731 --> 1:22:52.765
You're early.

1:22:55.167 --> 1:22:56.301
Come in.

1:23:07.379 --> 1:23:08.580
What are you working on?

1:23:10.182 --> 1:23:11.450
Nothing. Just...

1:23:12.451 --> 1:23:14.319
scheduling in a new client.

1:23:16.355 --> 1:23:17.456
Cool. Cool.

1:23:18.891 --> 1:23:20.492
So...

1:23:20.525 --> 1:23:22.895
you excited for our last visit?

1:23:25.397 --> 1:23:26.431
Yeah.

1:23:27.700 --> 1:23:28.735
It's...

1:23:30.435 --> 1:23:31.470
it's bittersweet.

1:23:32.739 --> 1:23:34.139
Yeah, I guess it is.

1:23:35.540 --> 1:23:39.378
Hey! I need to ask you something
before it slips my mind again, uh...

1:23:39.411 --> 1:23:42.882
what are you planning on doing with
all your paintings and drawings?

1:23:44.917 --> 1:23:47.419
Um,
probably just throw them out.

1:23:47.452 --> 1:23:49.756
I mean, they're just collecting
dust right now.

1:23:49.789 --> 1:23:52.157
What do you think about, uh...

1:23:53.660 --> 1:23:54.861
showing them off?

1:23:56.763 --> 1:23:57.797
What?

1:23:59.464 --> 1:24:00.667
What are you doing later?

1:24:20.285 --> 1:24:22.421
Hi! You must be Jake.

1:24:22.454 --> 1:24:24.924
- Yes, hi!
- I'm Carol. Nice to meet you.

1:24:24.957 --> 1:24:28.795
Sean's upstairs. Why don't you
come on in and help me with dinner?

1:24:33.331 --> 1:24:35.500
Sean tells me
that you're quite the artist.

1:24:35.534 --> 1:24:39.939
Um, yeah, I haven't actually
showed him anything yet.

1:24:39.972 --> 1:24:42.307
It takes a real artist
to do what you do.

1:24:42.340 --> 1:24:43.910
What's that?

1:24:43.943 --> 1:24:46.713
To expose yourself like that.

1:24:46.746 --> 1:24:51.583
To create something so intimate and
then just share it with the world.

1:24:54.921 --> 1:24:56.689
I haven't actually shared
anything yet.

1:24:59.391 --> 1:25:01.426
You haven't shown anyone?

1:25:01.460 --> 1:25:02.494
No.

1:25:03.963 --> 1:25:04.864
Mm.

1:25:06.498 --> 1:25:09.635
I know, but it's creepy, right?
Like...

1:25:09.669 --> 1:25:11.503
I don't even know
any of these people.

1:25:11.536 --> 1:25:13.773
That's what's beautiful.

1:25:13.806 --> 1:25:17.509
You have created this world
that you can relate to.

1:25:17.542 --> 1:25:19.578
That you can get lost in.

1:25:19.611 --> 1:25:21.814
Even if it's just
for a little while.

1:25:21.848 --> 1:25:23.448
And you know what?

1:25:23.482 --> 1:25:25.283
If you can do it...

1:25:25.317 --> 1:25:27.887
chances are, someone else
can get lost in there with you.

1:25:32.457 --> 1:25:35.427
- That does sound kind of cool.
- I know! She's good, right?

1:25:35.460 --> 1:25:37.429
Right!

1:25:37.462 --> 1:25:39.564
Seriously, though.

1:25:39.598 --> 1:25:41.500
I know someone
who could set you up.

1:28:26.564 --> 1:28:29.168
I always thought Sherry
had more hair than that.

1:28:30.136 --> 1:28:32.204
You made it!

1:28:32.238 --> 1:28:34.941
- Where's Carol?
- She's on her way.

1:28:34.974 --> 1:28:36.208
I wanted to come early.

1:28:37.542 --> 1:28:39.712
- Thanks for coming out.
- Wouldn't miss it.

1:28:42.715 --> 1:28:43.749
Yeah.

1:28:44.717 --> 1:28:46.118
This looks good.

1:28:46.152 --> 1:28:47.853
- Yeah?
- Mm-Hm.

1:28:49.422 --> 1:28:56.028
Yep. So much detail, you can
even see the pores on this guy's face.

1:28:56.062 --> 1:28:57.263
Ah, come on.

1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:01.701
Ah...

1:29:05.972 --> 1:29:07.006
You're good.

1:29:09.675 --> 1:29:12.912
Okay, one more. Alright.
Alright.

1:29:18.851 --> 1:29:20.219
I'm proud of you, Jake.

1:29:23.555 --> 1:29:26.058
Excuse me, I have a
question about one of your paintings.

1:29:26.092 --> 1:29:27.259
Sure, which?

1:29:34.166 --> 1:29:36.669
Um, which one?

1:29:36.702 --> 1:29:38.570
This one.

1:29:38.603 --> 1:29:40.139
Oh!

1:29:40.172 --> 1:29:41.640
Yeah, that one.

1:29:41.674 --> 1:29:43.743
Uh, it's me.

1:29:48.347 --> 1:29:50.049
Wow! Yeah.

1:29:51.217 --> 1:29:53.285
Yeah.

1:29:53.319 --> 1:29:54.552
That, uh...

1:29:57.289 --> 1:29:59.725
Yeah, that does look
a lot like you.

1:29:59.759 --> 1:30:01.293
It does.

1:30:01.327 --> 1:30:04.163
In fact, so much that someone
might say it is me.

1:30:06.365 --> 1:30:07.733
Yeah, I...

1:30:10.703 --> 1:30:11.603
Mm...

1:30:14.907 --> 1:30:16.308
Wait a minute.

1:30:16.342 --> 1:30:17.743
I remember you!

1:30:19.845 --> 1:30:23.282
- "Sherry!" Do you...
- Yeah!

1:30:23.315 --> 1:30:24.683
- Uh...
- Wow!

1:30:27.086 --> 1:30:28.120
Wow.

1:30:30.356 --> 1:30:33.926
Do you always paint pictures
of people you don't know?

1:30:35.127 --> 1:30:36.162
I guess.

1:30:37.229 --> 1:30:38.264
Okay.

1:30:39.932 --> 1:30:40.966
Well, um...

1:30:42.001 --> 1:30:43.601
I'm Sherry.

1:30:43.636 --> 1:30:45.071
Uh, I mean, obviously.

1:30:46.405 --> 1:30:47.907
It's nice to meet you.

1:30:50.276 --> 1:30:51.977
What's your name?

1:30:55.081 --> 1:30:55.981
Uh...

1:30:57.750 --> 1:30:58.784
I'm Jake.
