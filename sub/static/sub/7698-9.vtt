WEBVTT

01:17.493 --> 01:19.787
Don't take me
back there! Please!

01:21.539 --> 01:22.957
Look at me, Batman.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.750
I'm shaking with fear.

01:24.959 --> 01:27.086
Me, the Scarecrow.

01:27.169 --> 01:29.797
I wasn't even
going back to crime this time.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.341
Ijust had to get away from him.

01:39.515 --> 01:41.392
I'll take it from here, Batman.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.438
Lyle Bolton, Chief of Security.

01:45.980 --> 01:48.566
Congratulations, Professor Crane.

01:49.025 --> 01:52.570
You're the first inmate
to escape Arkham under my charge.

01:52.737 --> 01:55.656
You're also the last.

01:56.574 --> 02:00.578
I won't let you and the people
of Gotham City down again, Batman.

02:12.214 --> 02:14.675
That Bolton's a 10 on the creep-o-meter.

02:14.967 --> 02:17.720
But it seems like he's doing a good job
keeping the inmates in check.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.388
Maybe too good.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.355
I've called this informal inquest

02:27.438 --> 02:30.358
to address certain allegations
brought to my attention.

02:30.858 --> 02:32.943
Are you sure this hearing
was necessary, Wayne?

02:33.027 --> 02:36.113
Bolton was brought to Arkham
on a Wayne Foundation grant.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.407
With his knowledge
of high-tech security systems,

02:38.491 --> 02:40.451
I felt he was the perfect man
for the job.

02:40.576 --> 02:42.870
If anyone objects to my methods...

02:44.246 --> 02:46.374
Please, tell me.

02:49.418 --> 02:50.544
Ms. Quinn.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.547
Do you have any complaints
against Mr. Bolton?

02:59.512 --> 03:01.847
I got nothing to say.

03:01.931 --> 03:04.517
But surely you must have
something you wish to-

03:04.600 --> 03:06.686
You got a hearing problem or something?

03:06.769 --> 03:11.816
No, <i>nada,</i> ixnay, zero, zilch,
bupkes, nothing! Okay?

03:13.234 --> 03:16.278
It's all right.
I promise, you can speak freely here.

03:21.492 --> 03:24.745
- Mr. Bolton, he's a-
- A hard worker!

03:24.829 --> 03:26.622
A real stand-up guy.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.582
No complaints here, Chief.

03:30.334 --> 03:33.170
Professor Crane, you've been
sitting here for 10 minutes.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.298
- Don't you have anything to say?
- No, sir.

03:36.924 --> 03:40.177
And yet yours
was the loudest voice of protest.

03:40.261 --> 03:43.305
You must have some misgivings
about my methods.

03:45.015 --> 03:46.809
It seems I was mistaken.

03:49.186 --> 03:51.772
Well then, based on today's testimony,

03:51.856 --> 03:53.983
I propose extending
Mr. Bolton's contract

03:54.066 --> 03:55.735
for an additional 18 months.

03:55.943 --> 03:58.612
No! You can't! You don't know
what he's doing to us!

03:58.738 --> 03:59.780
Shut up!

03:59.864 --> 04:02.199
Don't listen to jerk-face here.
He don't know what he's saying!

04:02.575 --> 04:04.034
No, it's all true!

04:04.118 --> 04:06.579
If we don't speak up now,
we'll never get another chance!

04:06.662 --> 04:08.748
He threatens us,
takes away our privileges,

04:08.831 --> 04:10.291
even when we're good!

04:10.374 --> 04:12.376
We've heard enough of this nonsense.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.254
He says,
"Scum like us must be kept in line."

04:15.337 --> 04:19.800
That's why he chains us down at night
and electrifies our doors.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.052
He held me over a can
filled with termites.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.805
You hear me? Termites!

04:24.889 --> 04:26.265
He's an animal.

04:26.348 --> 04:27.808
<i>- A monster.
- Keep him away!</i>

04:27.892 --> 04:28.976
Shut up!

04:29.059 --> 04:30.311
All of you!

04:56.128 --> 04:57.630
You're all scum.

04:57.713 --> 05:01.258
You should be beaten within an inch
of your misbegotten lives.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.802
I've seen enough!

05:02.885 --> 05:05.137
Lyle Bolton, you're dismissed!

05:05.221 --> 05:07.014
Before I came here,

05:07.348 --> 05:11.352
Arkham was a revolving door
for every maniac in Gotham.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.646
I kept them in. Me!

05:14.146 --> 05:18.859
Now I realize I was wrong
to punish those pathetic miscreants!

05:19.276 --> 05:21.445
They're only symptoms.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.113
You're the cause!

05:23.531 --> 05:24.990
The gutless police,

05:25.366 --> 05:29.286
mindless bureaucrats,
and coddling doctors!

05:29.495 --> 05:34.708
You should all be locked up
in a cage without a key!

05:42.508 --> 05:43.592
Mr. Bolton,

05:43.676 --> 05:47.805
any comments about your dismissal
and the charges of extreme behavior?

05:48.264 --> 05:52.893
This city is an open wound
begging to be stitched.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.770
<i>Since that day three weeks ago,</i>

05:54.854 --> 05:57.982
<i>Lyle Bolton has been unavailable
for further comment.</i>

05:58.774 --> 06:00.985
<i>Next</i> up on Gotham Insider,

06:01.068 --> 06:04.280
<i>she's gorgeous, she's deadly
and she's back in town.</i>

06:04.363 --> 06:07.032
- Once <i>again, Poison Ivy has recently...</i>
- Look <i>at the way</i> these monsters

06:07.116 --> 06:09.118
are turned into heroes.

06:09.660 --> 06:13.205
It all starts with the permissive,
liberal media.

06:13.289 --> 06:15.291
<i>The villainous vixen of vines
made off with-</i>

06:30.931 --> 06:33.267
Thanks for the exclusive, Mr. Wayne.

06:33.475 --> 06:36.520
Do they always include
such a sumptuous meal?

06:36.645 --> 06:39.523
Only when the topic
is a successful Wayne Corp merger.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.984
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne.
You have an urgent phone call.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.194
If you'll excuse me.

07:01.503 --> 07:02.755
What the...

07:04.632 --> 07:05.633
Great.

07:24.735 --> 07:25.736
Summer?

07:57.351 --> 08:00.562
The time has come
to cleanse Gotham of the real criminals.

08:00.771 --> 08:04.733
You apprehend them, Dark Knight,
and Lock-Up will put them away.

08:05.025 --> 08:07.486
Together we can make
this city safe again.

08:07.611 --> 08:09.571
By kidnapping innocent victims?

08:10.030 --> 08:11.824
I don't think so.

08:12.282 --> 08:14.618
If you're not part of the solution,

08:15.035 --> 08:16.870
then you're part of the problem.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.351
You disappoint me, Batman.

08:39.435 --> 08:42.813
I thought you'd wanna see
this media leech get her comeuppance.

09:13.135 --> 09:14.636
Just what this town needs,

09:14.720 --> 09:17.014
another psycho in a Halloween costume.

09:26.648 --> 09:28.984
This is Lyle Bolton's handiwork.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.028
No one configures a lock like him.

09:31.111 --> 09:34.323
You mean this Lock-Up nut
is the security creep from Arkham?

09:34.406 --> 09:35.699
Without a doubt.

09:35.866 --> 09:39.328
Another fine villain made possible
by a grant from the Wayne Foundation.

09:41.413 --> 09:42.790
Only kidding.

09:46.376 --> 09:47.920
Bolton's last known address.

09:48.003 --> 09:49.463
See what you can find.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.934
Nice look. Early Alcatraz.

10:28.585 --> 10:30.170
Dr. Bartholomew?

10:42.474 --> 10:43.517
Commissioner?

10:43.600 --> 10:45.477
I lit the signal, Bats.

10:46.478 --> 10:50.190
That nutcase took the commish
and gave me these new cuff links.

10:50.274 --> 10:54.486
Took me 15 minutes to hit the switch
on your overgrown flashlight.

10:54.695 --> 10:57.364
You got any idea
what this is all about, cowl-head?

10:57.656 --> 10:58.866
I think so.

10:59.032 --> 11:00.450
First Summer Gleeson,

11:00.534 --> 11:02.494
then Bartholomew, and now Gordon.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.454
Put extra security around Mayor Hill.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.582
You mind letting me in on the joke?

11:09.376 --> 11:10.377
Typical.

11:13.672 --> 11:16.425
You want me to hide during a crisis?

11:16.800 --> 11:18.135
How will that look to the voters?

11:18.552 --> 11:20.220
This is overkill, Detective.

11:20.304 --> 11:23.015
I have the finest security system
in the city.

11:23.098 --> 11:24.975
It's virtually impenetrable.

11:25.058 --> 11:26.435
Virtually.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.314
But not completely.

11:31.148 --> 11:33.692
If we can slip through, so can Lock-Up.

11:43.702 --> 11:44.745
Mayor!

12:05.682 --> 12:07.476
Forget to pay a parking ticket?

12:13.398 --> 12:14.691
Move it.

12:24.284 --> 12:25.535
Ahh!

12:30.832 --> 12:33.627
I see your taste in prisoners
is improving, Bolton.

12:34.878 --> 12:38.507
You have three seconds
to release those bars.

12:38.882 --> 12:41.551
If you let us go now, Bolton,
I can guarantee leniency.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.055
No-

12:49.393 --> 12:51.728
I don't do leniency.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.029
Still nothing.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.033
Just as I suspected from the rust.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.911
A high salt content like seawater.

13:07.995 --> 13:12.249
Hey. What if F-84
is the serial number of a ship?

13:14.293 --> 13:15.877
Bingo.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.342
The Halsey was used
as a temporary prison

13:22.426 --> 13:24.094
while Stonegate was being built.

13:24.761 --> 13:25.804
Computer.

13:25.887 --> 13:28.890
Name of security chief
during Operation Stonegate.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.394
Well, blow me down.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.078
I've homed in on his power source.

13:51.955 --> 13:54.791
Shut down the security systems.
I'll take care of Bolton.

13:59.296 --> 14:01.381
You brought this on yourself, Batman.

14:26.990 --> 14:28.909
You're resourceful, Dark Knight.

14:28.992 --> 14:31.620
But sooner or later, you're mine.

14:51.306 --> 14:53.475
No regard for authority.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.644
We'll soon change that.

15:07.030 --> 15:09.491
You think that was my only defense?

15:11.868 --> 15:13.370
It's over, Bolton.

15:16.873 --> 15:18.166
Face it, Bolton.

15:18.375 --> 15:19.876
You've already lost.

15:28.510 --> 15:32.973
Amazing what a little
corrupted computer code will do.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.530
I still have my prisoners.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.754
- Commissioner? Mr. Mayor?
- Down here.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.800
Hang on, I'll get you out.

16:59.559 --> 17:01.895
I was working with you, Batman.

17:02.103 --> 17:04.105
You apprehended the scum of the earth,

17:04.189 --> 17:06.066
and I kept them locked away!

17:06.983 --> 17:08.818
I've seen how you treat your prisoners.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.570
Forgotten and scared.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.489
Without hope or compassion.

17:12.572 --> 17:15.492
Can it be you actually care
for those creatures?

17:15.575 --> 17:17.827
You're just as crazy as they are.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.333
Almost got it.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.126
Robin, hurry!

17:46.398 --> 17:51.152
I could have rid Gotham of the fools
in city hall and the police department.

17:51.319 --> 17:53.655
We could have made our own order!

17:53.738 --> 17:56.783
I was born to fight your brand of order.

17:56.866 --> 17:58.827
If that's your decision.

18:36.948 --> 18:39.409
Stay close. I think this is the way out.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.205
We could have been a team.

18:52.922 --> 18:54.341
Batman!

19:17.364 --> 19:18.490
Batman?

19:38.802 --> 19:40.762
I keep asking him
to teach me that trick.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.571
Hey, look, guys.
The big shot's back.

20:10.917 --> 20:15.880
Now you shall learn new lessons in fear.

20:23.680 --> 20:27.559
They thought they could trap me
in a world of Iunatics,

20:27.851 --> 20:29.477
but I showed them.

20:30.145 --> 20:32.897
Now, I can keep an eye on everyone.

20:34.441 --> 20:37.444
They'll never slip past me again.
