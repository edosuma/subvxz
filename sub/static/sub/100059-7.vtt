WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:05.657
- I oversold it, didn't I?

00:05.701 --> 00:07.094
I always do that.

00:07.137 --> 00:08.095
I should have just said,
"It's a good show.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.270
Maybe you'll like it."

00:09.313 --> 00:10.271
- It just made me
uncomfortable.

00:10.314 --> 00:11.228
I already have enough trouble

00:11.272 --> 00:12.273
as a working mom.

00:12.316 --> 00:13.404
I don't need to feel bad

00:13.448 --> 00:14.579
that I'm not also a KGB agent.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.103
Tell me again that Maya
didn't see

00:16.146 --> 00:17.278
the union cards.

00:17.321 --> 00:18.670
- She's the district manager.

00:18.714 --> 00:19.845
If she had seen them,

00:19.889 --> 00:21.151
she would have said something.

00:21.195 --> 00:23.023
Besides, you know,
even if she did,

00:23.066 --> 00:24.459
it's too late now.

00:24.502 --> 00:27.331
The union train has left
the station, baby!

00:27.375 --> 00:29.507
- A, that's just too much
for 8:00 a.m.,

00:29.551 --> 00:32.206
and B, it's not too late
for her to fire me.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.990
- Nobody's getting fired.
Get out of your head.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.731
You just have to co--

00:35.774 --> 00:37.211
- Maya!

00:37.254 --> 00:39.865
Hey, Maya's here.
- Yeah.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.432
- Hey, guys, sorry
to give you a scare there.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.086
Halloween was yesterday,
Maya.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.045
- Ha.
Yeah, it was.

00:45.088 --> 00:47.177
Um, so what's up?

00:47.221 --> 00:49.136
- Well,
I was planning my schedule,

00:49.179 --> 00:50.354
and I thought
instead of heading up

00:50.398 --> 00:52.139
to the boring Quincy branch,

00:52.182 --> 00:53.836
that maybe I'd spend
another day here.

00:53.879 --> 00:56.491
So I commandeered
a corner of your desk here.

00:56.534 --> 00:59.102
I hope you don't mind.
- No, please, commandeer away.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.712
- Great, thanks.
Also, did you know

01:00.756 --> 01:02.671
that your pug-a-day calendar is
a week ahead?

01:02.714 --> 01:05.674
- Yeah, I get curious.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.161
- I get that this
doesn't look great,

01:14.204 --> 01:16.119
but maybe it's as innocent
as it sounds.

01:16.163 --> 01:17.686
- Yeah, sure.

01:17.729 --> 01:19.427
She just happened to extend
her stay here

01:19.470 --> 01:21.124
the day after we turned in
the cards,

01:21.168 --> 01:22.734
because she didn't wanna go
to Quincy.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.954
Come on.
That store used to be a bank.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.129
It has a skylight.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.175
- I took Jerusha and Rose there

01:28.218 --> 01:29.306
for her birthday.

01:29.350 --> 01:30.916
- Quincy is a showstopper.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.222
Nobody's arguing that.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.702
I'm just saying,
Maya seems pretty chill.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.921
You know,
she's not like a typical DM.

01:35.965 --> 01:38.315
- Actually, sometimes,
it's the friendliest DMs

01:38.359 --> 01:40.317
who are secretly the harshest.

01:40.361 --> 01:42.537
Like, you remember Marty
over at Crestwood?

01:42.580 --> 01:45.148
One day, he's out playing
squash with his DM.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.454
The next day, he's fired

01:46.497 --> 01:48.195
and the DM marries
his daughter.

01:48.238 --> 01:49.370
- Really?

01:49.413 --> 01:50.719
- Well, the actual wedding

01:50.762 --> 01:51.807
wasn't the next day,

01:51.850 --> 01:52.982
but it makes a better story.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.157
- Okay, well,
Maya can't fire you

01:54.201 --> 01:55.506
for union stuff.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.291
- Well,
maybe that's why she's here.

01:57.334 --> 01:58.988
She's sticking around until
she finds something else

01:59.031 --> 02:00.250
she can fire me for.

02:00.294 --> 02:01.469
- Like what?
Your numbers are good.

02:01.512 --> 02:02.992
You don't do drugs.
You don't steal.

02:03.035 --> 02:05.125
Well, I've seen you pocket
Splenda packets in the cafÃ©,

02:05.168 --> 02:06.387
but we're talking, what, like,
a handful?

02:06.430 --> 02:07.953
- It's in the hundreds.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.216
- Don't worry.

02:09.259 --> 02:11.305
You are a great manager,

02:11.348 --> 02:13.263
and Maya's gonna see that,
you know,

02:13.307 --> 02:14.612
as long as we have
one of our good days

02:14.656 --> 02:16.614
in the store,
which we've been having

02:16.658 --> 02:17.702
a few of lately.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.139
- Thank you, Glenn.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.097
I know you thought
that was helpful.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.620
- Free eye exams!

02:22.664 --> 02:25.014
- See your partner better,
learn the truth!

02:25.057 --> 02:26.668
- Hey, you busy?

02:29.149 --> 02:30.498
I'm sorry,
I don't know what that was.

02:30.541 --> 02:31.934
Are you finishing
a magic trick?

02:31.977 --> 02:33.805
- No, I'm just saying
there's no one here.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.981
- You were doing a magic trick
for no one?

02:36.025 --> 02:38.158
- There's no magic trick!
Okay, what do you want?

02:38.201 --> 02:40.290
- I need someone to help me run
my shoplifter rehab course.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.509
Eddy's usually my assistant,

02:41.552 --> 02:43.206
but ironically,
he got arrested.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.686
- Oh, I'd be good
with shoplifters

02:44.729 --> 02:46.862
because I'm some sort
of criminal to you, huh?

02:46.905 --> 02:48.472
Just because I have
an ankle monitor,

02:48.516 --> 02:50.474
suddenly, I'm, like,
the cutest boy in the Crips?

02:50.518 --> 02:52.172
- Actually, there's a lot
of yelling involved,

02:52.215 --> 02:53.477
and I thought you'd be
interested in that.

02:53.521 --> 02:56.001
- Yeah, that sounds fun.
I'm in.

02:56.045 --> 02:58.656
- Amy and I combined
Spotify accounts last night.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.702
It just felt like time,
you know?

03:00.745 --> 03:02.182
- Wow, big step.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.444
I'm surprised
you weren't worried about

03:03.487 --> 03:05.707
ruining your personalized
recommendations.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.274
- Oh, good God.

03:07.317 --> 03:10.407
- Hey,
what do you think of these?

03:10.451 --> 03:13.976
- I think those are candles
with anchors on them.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.630
- Thanks, I like 'em too.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.414
Jerry wants our wedding
to have a nautical theme

03:17.458 --> 03:18.633
since he was born on a tugboat.

03:18.676 --> 03:20.287
- Well,
a boat does have an anchor,

03:20.330 --> 03:21.636
so you nailed it.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.246
- Okay, these are the last ones

03:23.290 --> 03:25.335
I could find in the back.

03:25.379 --> 03:29.557
- Oh,
so Carol's helping you out?

03:29.600 --> 03:32.516
- Sandra and I are committed
to repairing our friendship.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.258
Bricks on the back are lighter
than pebbles in the soul,

03:35.302 --> 03:37.260
right, Sandra?

03:37.304 --> 03:39.697
- So much lighter.

03:39.741 --> 03:42.396
- Okay, I'm gonna go see
if I can find a captain's hat

03:42.439 --> 03:45.355
that will fit Jerry's
big ol' melon.

03:47.183 --> 03:49.054
- Are you sure you're okay?

03:49.098 --> 03:50.230
- Totally.

03:50.273 --> 03:51.492
And so you know,

03:51.535 --> 03:52.580
I'll be here for the next hour

03:52.623 --> 03:54.190
and then I'll be in grocery,

03:54.234 --> 03:56.323
just in case you wanna
say hi later

03:56.366 --> 03:58.238
and make sure
something's not wrong.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.328
Not that it would be.

04:01.371 --> 04:03.243
But here and then grocery.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.943
- Oh, it looks like
you swapped out those scanners

04:07.986 --> 04:09.161
that were causing hand cancer.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.380
- Yes.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.817
- Uh, no disciplinary write-ups

04:12.861 --> 04:13.992
in the last quarter.

04:14.036 --> 04:15.951
- Yeah.
No--no--no need.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.082
- Good.

04:17.126 --> 04:18.301
- I don't know where

04:18.345 --> 04:19.389
your nice flip-flops are,
Bo.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.738
Just wear anything.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.827
- Excuse me just one second.
- Uh-huh.

04:22.871 --> 04:25.003
- Cheyenne, you know
we're not supposed to be

04:25.047 --> 04:27.876
on personal phone calls
on the floor.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.051
- Just one second.

04:29.094 --> 04:30.313
You can't just blow it off.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.575
You have to get here.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.751
Take a bath with the dogs
later.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.014
My husband's being
such a b-munch right now.

04:36.058 --> 04:38.582
- Okay, well, just because
he's being a b-munch,

04:38.626 --> 04:40.236
doesn't mean
that's a good enough reason

04:40.280 --> 04:41.455
to not be working.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.195
- Totally. Bye, Bo.

04:43.239 --> 04:44.936
- Honestly, this never happens.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.590
- Well, it's hard to police
phone stuff.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.244
- Well, not for me, it isn't.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.378
Attention employees.
Uh, listen up.

04:51.421 --> 04:54.598
Just a reminder that this couch
here is not a mobile hot spot.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.644
No cell phones, per usual.

04:56.687 --> 04:58.341
Don't know why I have to
say it again.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.343
- Can whoever is talking
keep it down?

05:00.387 --> 05:01.823
We're trying to watch
news anchor fails

05:01.866 --> 05:03.999
and the sound quality's
full "garbagio."

05:05.740 --> 05:07.611
- She did put her phone away.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.134
- Listen up, scrodes.

05:09.178 --> 05:11.528
My name is Dina Fox,
and my goal here today is

05:11.572 --> 05:14.052
to cure you lowlife scum
of your criminal tendencies

05:14.096 --> 05:16.446
and transform you
into upstanding citizens.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.448
If that's even possible.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.581
- Ah!
Sorry I'm late.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.800
Oh, I thought I saw a manatee
on the side of the road.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.367
Hoo-hoo.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.629
Turns out, it was just
a gray sweatshirt.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.892
Oh,
but that sweatshirt was huge!

05:27.936 --> 05:30.634
- Okay, just sit down, Bo.
Thank you.

05:30.678 --> 05:33.245
All right,
if you pass this course,

05:33.289 --> 05:35.726
The store will not be
pressing criminal charges.

05:35.770 --> 05:38.990
If you fail, your crimes will
be reported to the fuzz.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.252
Right, Mateo?

05:40.296 --> 05:41.471
- I've got
the local police station

05:41.515 --> 05:42.951
right here in my contacts.

05:42.994 --> 05:45.301
- Isn't it just 911?
- Silence, scrode!

05:45.345 --> 05:48.609
- Oh, dang, dude got roasted!

05:48.652 --> 05:50.219
- Okay, first things first.

05:50.262 --> 05:51.481
I want you all to take out

05:51.525 --> 05:53.265
your corporate-approved
workbooks

05:53.309 --> 05:55.398
and just rip them up.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.834
Go ahead.
We're gonna do things

05:56.878 --> 05:58.923
a little bit differently
here today.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.403
That's it, go on.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.187
- Yeah.
Ha-ha.

06:02.231 --> 06:03.754
- All right.

06:03.798 --> 06:06.975
Anyone who ripped up
their workbook has failed.

06:07.018 --> 06:08.498
You just destroyed
company property.

06:08.542 --> 06:11.458
Get out!
- Aw, man.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.068
That's the third time
I've fell for this.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.288
- "Attention employees,

06:16.332 --> 06:18.029
"please gather
in the break room

06:18.073 --> 06:22.556
for our regularly-scheduled
refresher on store rules."

06:22.599 --> 06:25.123
I'm emphasizing
"regularly-scheduled"

06:25.167 --> 06:26.690
because it's underlined twice

06:26.734 --> 06:29.650
on this piece of paper
Amy just handed me.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.521
- Okay, no phones on the floor,

06:31.565 --> 06:33.610
Laptops are for customers.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.657
If there's time to lean,
there's time to...

06:36.700 --> 06:38.441
- Oh, I know, dream.

06:38.485 --> 06:39.703
- No, not dream.

06:39.747 --> 06:41.879
- Lean.
- I just said lean.

06:41.923 --> 06:44.447
- Oh, come on, guys.
You know she means clean,

06:44.491 --> 06:46.057
which most of us are
already doing

06:46.101 --> 06:47.407
in our downtime anyway.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.234
- Yep, that's right.

06:49.278 --> 06:50.410
- 'Cause we know
if we ever stopped

06:50.453 --> 06:51.715
working our tails off,

06:51.759 --> 06:53.978
Amy will swoop in
to smack us around.

06:54.022 --> 06:56.416
- Well,
not quite smack us around,

06:56.459 --> 06:57.895
but write us up.

06:57.939 --> 07:00.158
- Yeah, no,
I don't hit my employees.

07:00.202 --> 07:02.552
- I figured that.
- Okay.

07:02.596 --> 07:05.903
Next rule,
always clock in on time.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.601
- What if on your way
to work, you see a plane crash

07:07.644 --> 07:08.950
and need to stop
to pull passengers

07:08.993 --> 07:10.081
from the wreckage?

07:10.125 --> 07:12.606
- Um, if on your way in,

07:12.649 --> 07:16.087
you see a plane crash,
then you can be late.

07:16.131 --> 07:18.699
- Oh, but what about
a train crash?

07:18.742 --> 07:20.657
- Um, any of the crashes.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.050
All right, we're moving on.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.486
- Well, what if
it's a fender bender

07:23.530 --> 07:24.835
where someone could have
been hurt?

07:24.879 --> 07:26.184
- Okay, Marcus,
I'm sure they're fine.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.359
We should probably keep going.

07:27.403 --> 07:28.709
But what if they're not?

07:28.752 --> 07:30.275
What if they have a baby
in the back

07:30.319 --> 07:31.886
and it's, like, loose
and it's rolling around

07:31.929 --> 07:33.496
like a volleyball?
- All right, that's it.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.106
I'm writing you up
for insubordination.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.107
- I get written up for that,

07:36.151 --> 07:37.326
but Russell can smoke pot

07:37.369 --> 07:38.370
in the garden center?

07:38.414 --> 07:39.894
- What?

07:39.937 --> 07:42.026
Well, I didn't know
that was happening,

07:42.070 --> 07:44.986
so now that I do,
I'm gonna right him up.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.596
- Hey, thanks, dick.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.945
This is why you weren't invited
to bowling.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.470
- I knew you guys were bowling!
I knew it!

07:50.513 --> 07:53.255
And you looked me in my eyes,
and you told me it was a myth.

07:53.298 --> 07:54.474
- Yeah, what are you gonna do
about it?

07:54.517 --> 07:55.649
- Oh, come at me, bro.

07:55.692 --> 07:57.302
Jonah, get my back.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.608
- I'm not gonna do that.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.655
- Hey, hey, hey!
No, no, no, no!

08:03.570 --> 08:04.788
- Horseman!
- Russell!

08:04.832 --> 08:06.181
- "Horseman," that's the cue!

08:10.098 --> 08:12.622
- Well, Maya reported
the fight to HR.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.319
She said it wasn't a big deal,

08:14.363 --> 08:16.060
but she couldn't even look me
in the eye when she said it,

08:16.104 --> 08:17.497
which I have
a teenager daughter,

08:17.540 --> 08:18.585
I know what that means.

08:18.628 --> 08:19.629
- It's not even your fault.

08:19.673 --> 08:20.978
It's not like you're the one

08:21.022 --> 08:22.240
who slammed Russell
on the table.

08:22.284 --> 08:23.285
If anything,
you broke the fight up

08:23.328 --> 08:24.547
by pouring oat milk on 'em.

08:24.591 --> 08:25.983
It was weird but effective.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.158
- It doesn't even matter.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.464
At this point,
it just looks like

08:28.508 --> 08:30.553
I have zero control
over my employees.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.294
- Oh, it'll be fine.

08:32.337 --> 08:34.078
You just need to find a way
to show Maya

08:34.122 --> 08:35.689
that you mean business.

08:35.732 --> 08:38.561
It's too bad you can't
just fire someone, though.

08:38.605 --> 08:41.912
- Yeah.
But maybe I could.

08:41.956 --> 08:44.175
- Wait,
are you talking about me?

08:44.219 --> 08:46.526
Fine, Amy, you can't fire me.
I quit.

08:46.569 --> 08:49.354
- Glenn, calm down.
I'm gonna fire anyone.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.443
I'm just saying,
maybe I can make it look

08:51.487 --> 08:53.097
like I'm firing someone.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.621
- You know, it's just not fair.

08:54.664 --> 08:56.536
Dina's using, like, hypnosis
or some crap.

08:56.579 --> 08:59.669
- You gotta stop blaming
all your problems on hypnosis.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.062
- Hello there.

09:01.105 --> 09:03.194
I'd like to buy
these apples, please.

09:03.238 --> 09:05.762
- No problem.
That'll be 50 cents.

09:05.806 --> 09:09.113
- But apples usually cost
40 cents.

09:09.157 --> 09:10.985
I don't understand.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.377
- Cloud 9 had to raise
the price

09:12.421 --> 09:14.554
due to all the people
stealing them.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.120
- But I never stole.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.949
Now my children shall go
hungry tonight.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.473
- And scene.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.697
- You think we can get
a bathroom break?

09:27.741 --> 09:29.264
It's been two hours of this.

09:29.307 --> 09:30.831
- Oh, you need to use
the restroom?

09:30.874 --> 09:32.833
Why, so you can steal
a quart of our pink soap?

09:32.876 --> 09:34.225
You think I don't know how much

09:34.269 --> 09:35.139
that stuff goes for
on the street?

09:35.183 --> 09:36.488
Absolutely not.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.055
All right, Mateo,
could you play

09:38.099 --> 09:38.969
Dock Worker number one
in this next series?

09:39.013 --> 09:40.057
- Yep.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.363
No, wait.

09:41.406 --> 09:42.233
Yep.

09:42.277 --> 09:43.408
Yep.

09:43.452 --> 09:44.584
I'll find it.

09:44.627 --> 09:45.628
- Okay, so what's in it
for me?

09:45.672 --> 09:46.716
- Well, I mean,

09:46.760 --> 09:47.717
if you help me out

09:47.761 --> 09:48.718
and all goes well,

09:48.762 --> 09:50.154
I'll...I'll make sure

09:50.198 --> 09:52.069
Dina passes you
in the shoplifter class.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.595
- A'ight, I'm in.
- Okay, great.

09:55.638 --> 09:58.423
So you just slack off,
and then I'll come find you

09:58.467 --> 10:00.817
and say, "Where's that
Turtle Wax endcap

10:00.861 --> 10:03.080
I told you to put up?
This is your third strike."

10:03.124 --> 10:05.082
And I'll fire you
in front of Maya.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.345
- Oh.
- Okay, here's your vest.

10:07.389 --> 10:09.260
- What?
"Dave"?

10:09.304 --> 10:13.134
I wanna be Puma,
raised in the jungles of Peru,

10:13.177 --> 10:14.918
but his parents snuck him
into America

10:14.962 --> 10:16.572
on an atomic submarine.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.618
- Oh, does he ever go back?
- Okay, so--

10:18.661 --> 10:20.271
- Okay,
I don't have time for this.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.012
Somebody put Skittles
in the Coinstar machine.

10:22.056 --> 10:24.667
I have to fix it
before Maya sees.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.103
- Okay, back to work.

10:26.147 --> 10:27.670
- Check it out.
What's up?

10:27.714 --> 10:28.845
I'm an employee right now.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.151
Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:30.194 --> 10:32.893
- Uh, excuse me.
Attention, everybody.

10:32.936 --> 10:35.809
Green beans are now $1 million,
so...

10:35.852 --> 10:37.985
- Okay, Bo, stop.
All right?

10:38.028 --> 10:40.117
You need to take this
seriously.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.989
I can't keep bailing you
out of jail.

10:42.032 --> 10:43.817
We have, like, no money.

10:43.860 --> 10:46.123
- Fine, okay.

10:46.167 --> 10:50.301
Green beans are now
the normal price.

10:50.345 --> 10:52.564
- That was good.
- Yeah.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.218
- Mmm.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.047
I like this one,

10:57.091 --> 10:58.832
but I don't think
we can do Funfetti.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.703
Jerry's family
is very conservative.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.184
- Wait, there's one more
I want you to try.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.794
It's homemade.

11:04.838 --> 11:07.971
- Oh, you--you made that?
- Yeah, just for you.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.756
It's got a secret ingredient.

11:09.799 --> 11:10.974
- Ooh.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.541
Oh.
- Come on, open up.

11:12.584 --> 11:13.673
- Okay.

11:16.893 --> 11:19.504
Mmm.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.637
So good.

11:21.681 --> 11:25.293
- And now we wait.
- For what?

11:25.336 --> 11:27.512
- For your wedding.
- Oh.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.649
- Um, hey, Dave.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.303
- Oh, what up, Amy?

11:35.346 --> 11:38.523
- What up, Dave, is that
I asked you hours ago

11:38.567 --> 11:40.134
to assemble
the Turtle Wax endcap,

11:40.177 --> 11:41.439
and it's still not done.

11:41.483 --> 11:42.745
- Oh, actually,
I was gonna tell you--

11:42.789 --> 11:44.573
- No, I don't wanna hear
any of your excuses.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.053
You know what?

11:46.096 --> 11:47.141
This is your third strike
this month.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.272
I made up my mind.

11:48.316 --> 11:49.796
I'm gonna have to let you go.

11:49.839 --> 11:52.146
I'm so sorry you have
to witness this, Maya.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.887
- No, please,
these are your employees.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.541
- Yeah, I was gonna say
I did that endcap a while ago.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.108
I set it up in the breezeway,
you know,

11:58.152 --> 11:59.806
more foot traffic
and et ceteras.

12:01.242 --> 12:03.984
- Wow, um--uh--wow.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.681
I'm--I'm just stunned,

12:05.725 --> 12:09.467
because this is isn't what
we agreed upon, Dave.

12:09.511 --> 12:12.427
- Yeah, well, I was thinking
about something Cheyenne said,

12:12.470 --> 12:14.429
and I figured, like,
if I did a really good job,

12:14.472 --> 12:16.387
then it wouldn't
really make sense to fire me,

12:16.431 --> 12:18.215
because that would be, like,
bad management.

12:18.259 --> 12:19.956
Know what I'm saying?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.002
So, uh,
guess I still work here.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.481
Maybe I can pick up
a few extra shifts.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.048
- No.
No, no, no.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.050
I already said
that you're fired.

12:27.094 --> 12:29.487
And--and--and what I say goes,

12:29.531 --> 12:31.054
and I'm a--I'm a woman
of my word.

12:31.098 --> 12:34.057
So--so all of those things
put together

12:34.101 --> 12:35.145
means you're fired.

12:35.189 --> 12:36.668
- Aw, man.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.801
Cheyenne was right.
I'm a screwup.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.238
I'm just a dumb, useless butt.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.849
- No, Dave, no.
- No, no, no.

12:42.892 --> 12:46.374
- No, nobody is getting fired
today, all right?

12:46.417 --> 12:48.202
- Really?
- Yes.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.815
Amy, why don't you and I go
have lunch?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.820
- What's up?
Dave's back, y'all.

12:59.213 --> 13:00.475
Heh-heh.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.654
- She's taking me out to lunch.
She's gonna fire me, right?

13:05.697 --> 13:07.177
- No.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.179
I mean,
that is how they fired Marty,

13:09.223 --> 13:10.528
so he wouldn't have
some violent outburst

13:10.572 --> 13:11.573
in the store.

13:11.616 --> 13:12.966
But maybe Maya's got

13:13.009 --> 13:14.924
some really great news for you,

13:14.968 --> 13:17.840
and she's worried about you
having a positive outburst.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.494
- Yeah, like, you know,

13:19.537 --> 13:21.278
"Oh, this news is so great,

13:21.322 --> 13:23.715
I wanna choke somebody out."

13:23.759 --> 13:26.849
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I'm sure that's what it is.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.247
- This is not good.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.814
- So?

13:34.857 --> 13:36.554
- Yeah,
I think they're gonna fire her.

13:36.598 --> 13:37.642
- Wow.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.602
So I guess
you'll be manager again.

13:40.645 --> 13:41.777
- What?
No.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.648
I would never take Amy's job.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.433
- Why not?
You did it for years.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.783
Who else is gonna do it?

13:47.827 --> 13:50.090
- I mean,
I guess I got no choice.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.831
And the store needs a manager.

13:51.874 --> 13:55.138
- And we need one, like, now.
This place is crazy.

13:55.182 --> 13:57.619
There was a fight earlier.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.753
- This is perfect
for the honeymoon.

14:01.797 --> 14:04.104
- There's just so many holes.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.889
- Oh, Sandra, our bodies are
vessels of beauty.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.499
Don't be ashamed.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.806
God, I can't wait to see
Jerry's face

14:10.850 --> 14:12.286
when he sees this.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.114
- Huh?

14:14.157 --> 14:16.507
- I said, I can't wait
for you to see Jerry's face

14:16.551 --> 14:17.639
when he sees this.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.950
- Attention, shoppers,
please gather

14:23.993 --> 14:25.952
for a very special parade.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.649
That's right,
it's the Cloud 9

14:27.692 --> 14:30.652
Shoplifters Parade of Shame.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.132
Here, you read these.

14:32.175 --> 14:33.437
I'm gonna pass out
the tomatoes.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.091
- Tomatoes?
Dina...

14:35.135 --> 14:36.745
those aren't for throwing,
are they?

14:36.788 --> 14:38.834
- What?
Oh, no.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.749
No, no, no.
These are free samples.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.142
And if someone felt
compelled to throw one,

14:42.185 --> 14:43.883
that would be
both illegal and wrong,

14:43.926 --> 14:46.189
just like shoplifting.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.281
- Ooh, wow, "local clams."

14:51.325 --> 14:53.327
Where do you think
they're getting those from?

14:53.370 --> 14:55.111
- Uh--uh, the river.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.112
- The river?

14:56.156 --> 14:57.984
- Okay,
I can't do this anymore.

14:58.027 --> 15:00.943
Maya, I know that I have been
messing up all day.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.510
But before you fire me,

15:02.553 --> 15:05.121
I think you should know that
I am a really good manager

15:05.165 --> 15:06.862
and--and--and--and
I command respect

15:06.906 --> 15:08.081
and I don't do drugs

15:08.124 --> 15:09.691
and I don't steal
Splenda packets.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.954
- Amy, I asked you to lunch

15:11.998 --> 15:13.477
because I thought a break
from the store

15:13.521 --> 15:15.740
might help you chill out, girl.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.525
- Really?
- Yes.

15:17.568 --> 15:20.006
I am not here
to fire anybody.

15:20.049 --> 15:24.793
- Okay, 'cause, um,
today has been a disaster.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.012
I mean, I would fire me.

15:26.055 --> 15:29.189
- It has been weird.
- Yeah.

15:29.232 --> 15:32.279
- Sure, but you're nervous.
I get it.

15:32.322 --> 15:33.976
When the DM would visit
my store,

15:34.020 --> 15:37.197
I would sweat through my shirt.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.852
- Yeah, there's a storm brewing
underneath here.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.115
- Yeah.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.987
- So then if I--if I wanted
to get

15:45.031 --> 15:47.163
a glass of wine, is...

15:47.207 --> 15:48.991
- I mean, you are going back
to the store after this,

15:49.035 --> 15:50.297
though, right?

15:50.340 --> 15:52.212
- Yeah, no, I just--I meant
for later,

15:52.255 --> 15:54.562
for a friend--you're just
joking.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.085
Of course.
I knew that.

15:56.129 --> 15:57.304
I got it.

15:57.347 --> 16:00.176
- Can I have some
of the house red?

16:00.220 --> 16:03.179
That's not a waiter.
It's just a man.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.789
- Get out.
- What?

16:04.833 --> 16:05.921
What?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.575
- Oh!
- Oh.

16:07.618 --> 16:11.057
- Uh, Bo, Maya's not here.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.320
You don't have to keep
pretending to be an employee.

16:13.363 --> 16:15.626
- Oh, no, it's cool.
Glenn hired him.

16:15.670 --> 16:19.021
- Yeah, what's up?
Your boy Dave is here to stay.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.457
Ah!
- I'm sorry, Glenn?

16:20.501 --> 16:22.111
Why would Glenn--
- Hey, Preet, go to two.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.809
Oh, uh, Jonah,
we've got a Hazmat situation

16:24.853 --> 16:26.202
over in housewares.

16:26.246 --> 16:27.638
Grab a pair of gloves
and head over.

16:27.682 --> 16:30.032
Preety, I need those POUs.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.252
- Why would--do I have to?

16:32.295 --> 16:34.950
Was he wearing a tie
this morning?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.734
- And I was like,
"I don't care. Write me up."

16:36.778 --> 16:39.781
I am not doing a Latin accent
to sell some queso.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.478
- Oh, my God,
that happened to me,

16:41.522 --> 16:42.871
but with salsa.

16:44.481 --> 16:47.180
- We have so much in common.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.922
- I like you, Amy.

16:50.966 --> 16:53.708
Hell, that's why I stuck around
another day.

16:55.797 --> 16:56.711
You know,
I just wanna make sure

16:56.754 --> 16:59.366
that you're being...careful.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.282
- Uh, what do you mean?

17:02.325 --> 17:04.023
- I know about
your branch's history

17:04.066 --> 17:05.981
with unionizing.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.461
Mm-hmm.

17:07.504 --> 17:08.549
- And in my experience,

17:08.592 --> 17:10.072
These things never go away.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.639
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.989
- I mean, I'm not saying
that you're caught up

17:14.033 --> 17:15.077
in all of this,

17:15.121 --> 17:16.252
but if corporate even thinks

17:16.296 --> 17:17.514
that you're helping the union,

17:17.558 --> 17:18.472
you will be throwing away

17:18.515 --> 17:20.126
your future with them.

17:20.169 --> 17:23.042
- My--my future with corporate?
- Yes, girl.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.957
You are bright.
Your numbers are great.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.872
Chicago could really use
somebody like you.

17:27.916 --> 17:32.138
Well, I don't know what to say.

17:32.181 --> 17:36.490
- Protect your future, chica.
You could be going places.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.666
Salud.

17:44.324 --> 17:48.110
- Anytime one of you is tempted
to steal this money,

17:48.154 --> 17:50.678
Mateo is gonna spray you
in the face

17:50.721 --> 17:52.462
with that squirt bottle.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.464
- Now,
is it just water in there?

17:54.508 --> 17:57.250
For legal reasons,
let's say yes.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.339
- This is messed up.
- What's that?

17:59.382 --> 18:02.603
- That's what I thought.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.126
I'm gonna check on Gerald,

18:04.170 --> 18:05.214
see if he's done crying
in the men's room.

18:05.258 --> 18:06.955
In the meantime, Mateo,

18:06.998 --> 18:08.913
don't be stingy
with the squirts.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.613
- Don't worry.
I'm not gonna squirt anyone.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.658
I know you're not gonna
steal the money.

18:14.702 --> 18:17.966
- We should steal it,
at least get my 200 bucks back.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.533
- What 200?
- The fee for this

18:19.576 --> 18:21.143
ridiculous class.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.232
- Wait, Cloud 9 is charging you
to take this?

18:23.276 --> 18:24.581
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.192
- So the company won't file

18:26.235 --> 18:28.890
a police report
so long as you pay $200?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.413
- These people, they're evil.

18:30.457 --> 18:33.373
- Oh, trust me.
You have no idea.

18:36.724 --> 18:39.509
- Jen went home sick,
so I'm putting you on deli.

18:39.553 --> 18:40.902
But don't eat that ham,

18:40.945 --> 18:42.382
'cause that's what made
Jen sick.

18:42.425 --> 18:45.298
Okay.

18:45.341 --> 18:46.777
Oh, thank God.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.694
Oh.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.870
Alex, could you--thank you.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.133
And get out.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.135
So how'd it go?

18:56.178 --> 18:59.268
- Oddly, really well.
Guess I'm still the manager.

18:59.312 --> 19:00.574
- Yeah, great.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.532
See, I knew you'd be okay.

19:02.576 --> 19:05.796
- You sure did.
- Yeah.

19:05.840 --> 19:09.365
Hey, you guys.
I'm sorry, Bo.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.193
It turns out,
I'm not the manager.

19:11.237 --> 19:14.979
So you're not hired.
- Whoa, this is not okay.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.329
Look at this thing.

19:16.372 --> 19:19.070
This display's my masterpiece
right here.

19:19.114 --> 19:21.812
If I'm not staying here,
neither are my turtles.

19:21.856 --> 19:24.206
Turt-turt, we're out of here.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.555
- Oh...

19:25.599 --> 19:28.558
I mean,
I guess that's only fair.

19:28.602 --> 19:31.387
- Well, it's
Amy's problem now.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.520
- I've got the bucket
of wet socks.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.565
Where is everyone?

19:35.609 --> 19:37.567
On one of their
precious bathroom breaks?

19:37.611 --> 19:38.960
- I let them go.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.310
- You what?

19:41.354 --> 19:42.790
- I just couldn't stand
the fact

19:42.833 --> 19:44.574
that this company
was extorting these people

19:44.618 --> 19:45.880
out of their
hard-earned money.

19:45.923 --> 19:48.839
It wasn't right.
- Huh.

19:48.883 --> 19:50.406
Wait.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.626
Did you take
their money instead?

19:52.669 --> 19:54.323
- Well, it had
to go somewhere.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.411
- Uh-huh.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.239
Half to me
for a new security camera,

19:57.283 --> 19:59.067
and I look the other way.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.199
- A third.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.506
- Your hand is like velvet.

20:03.550 --> 20:06.117
- I sleep with gloves on.
- Hmm.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.511
- And then she said she thought
I was smart and capable,

20:08.555 --> 20:09.773
which, duh.

20:09.817 --> 20:11.601
And I mean,
I know this is silly,

20:11.645 --> 20:13.473
but she even mentioned
something like--

20:13.516 --> 20:16.389
I don't know--someone like me
had a future at corporate.

20:16.432 --> 20:17.868
Wow.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.566
Sounds like corporate's really
pulling out all the stops.

20:19.609 --> 20:20.915
Taking you to lunch,

20:20.958 --> 20:22.482
trying to buy your allegiance

20:22.525 --> 20:24.440
with some bogus
career opportunity--

20:24.484 --> 20:26.094
It's the same crap
they pulled with Jeff.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.139
- Well, I mean, I don't know
that it was a ploy.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.793
I mean, is it
so hard to believe

20:29.837 --> 20:31.404
she just thinks
I'm a good manager?

20:31.447 --> 20:33.014
- No, no. You're obviously
a great manager.

20:33.057 --> 20:36.235
It's just there's always
an agenda with these people.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.759
Anyway, it's not like you're
truly considering going off

20:38.802 --> 20:40.456
to be an executive at Cloud 9.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.371
- Ha. Yeah.

20:42.415 --> 20:46.201
I mean, could you imagine--
me going off to the dark side?

20:48.725 --> 20:52.338
- Why are there pictures
of Jerusha in my office?

20:53.339 --> 20:56.342
- Sandra, relax. This is gonna
be a fun little road trip.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.779
I'm telling you,
it's the fantasy wedding venue.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.563
- Uh-huh. Yeah, it's just--

21:00.607 --> 21:01.999
I'm curious
what other people think,

21:02.043 --> 21:03.479
so maybe Marcus
could join us?

21:03.523 --> 21:04.654
- There's no time.

21:04.698 --> 21:06.308
We want to get there
before sunset.

21:06.352 --> 21:07.744
God, you're gonna love it--

21:07.788 --> 21:10.660
beautiful cliffside views
and super remote.

21:10.704 --> 21:13.489
I mean, no one for miles.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.491
Sandra. Sandra!

21:15.535 --> 21:17.014
Sandra, what happened?

21:17.058 --> 21:20.583
Did you fall out?
Where are you going?

21:20.627 --> 21:22.716
Sandra!
