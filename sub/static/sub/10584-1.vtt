02:21.058 --> 02:23.727
- Thank you, Jason. On time.
- You bet!

02:26.105 --> 02:27.355
Link.

02:27.857 --> 02:29.566
Link Appleyard!

02:30.359 --> 02:33.153
- Oh, Miss Hallie.
- Hello, Marshal.

02:33.237 --> 02:36.406
- Howdy, Mr Senator.
- No, no. Rance. Rance.

02:36.907 --> 02:40.201
Rance... Sure glad you could come.

02:40.411 --> 02:43.121
Your wire caught us in Saint Louis.
Thank you.

02:43.456 --> 02:48.001
My buckboard's right over there.
Now, Jason, give me that box.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.794
You knew they were coming!

02:49.879 --> 02:54.049
That's the first time you ever
kept a secret! Blabbermouth!

02:54.300 --> 02:56.718
Who was that, Jason?
Anybody worth a line in the paper?

02:56.802 --> 02:58.094
A line?

02:58.262 --> 03:01.473
You blasted fool,
that's Senator Stoddard and his wife.

03:01.557 --> 03:04.225
You can fill your newspaper with them!

03:08.314 --> 03:11.024
Hi, Lydia. Charlie Hasbrouck.
Emergency!

03:11.108 --> 03:15.278
Tell the editor Senator Stoddard
and his wife just got here!

03:15.363 --> 03:17.155
That's right! Thanks!

03:17.698 --> 03:19.532
Hey, that's a nickel!

03:19.617 --> 03:21.826
Charge the Shinbone Star!

03:34.924 --> 03:37.467
Hey, Senator! Senator Stoddard, ma'am.

03:38.010 --> 03:41.596
Could you give me an interview?
Exclusive, like. A scoop!

03:42.807 --> 03:44.641
Shinbone Star...

03:45.226 --> 03:48.645
Well, now, son, I... All right.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.980
I'll give the interview,
but only for one reason.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.109
One reason... Dutton Peabody,

03:54.735 --> 04:00.156
founder, publisher, editor-in-chief
of the Shinbone Star once fired me.

04:00.533 --> 04:03.034
I'll be fired
if I don't get this interview.

04:03.119 --> 04:05.161
Is it true you're going to...

04:05.538 --> 04:06.830
Here he comes now.

04:11.210 --> 04:14.712
Senator Stoddard, this is a surprise
and an honour, sir!

04:14.797 --> 04:18.132
- Maxwell Scott, editor of the Star.
- How do you do, Mr Scott?

04:18.216 --> 04:20.969
- This is Mrs Stoddard.
- A pleasure, ma'am.

04:21.053 --> 04:24.264
What brings you back, sir?
Is it true you're going to run...

04:24.348 --> 04:26.558
Oh, no. Hold on, Mr Scott.

04:26.642 --> 04:30.895
Who am I giving this interview to?
You or this young fellow here?

04:30.980 --> 04:34.190
- Who asked first, by the way.
- I sure did.

04:34.275 --> 04:37.485
If you're a good reporter
you'll invite them into our office,

04:37.570 --> 04:38.778
out of the sun and dust.

04:38.863 --> 04:43.032
He's right. Best way to make a man
talk is to make him comfortable.

04:43.325 --> 04:47.287
Well, it's back
in business again, politics.

04:47.371 --> 04:51.166
Link, why don't you take Hallie
for a little ride around town?

04:52.001 --> 04:53.877
Lot of changes, huh?

04:54.044 --> 04:57.797
I'll go with these fellows
and mend a few political fences.

05:06.557 --> 05:09.142
I notice you're not wearing the star.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.144
Oh, shucks, Miss Hallie.

05:11.228 --> 05:14.647
They haven't elected me
Town Marshal for a dog's age.

05:15.399 --> 05:18.151
I reckon the only one of us
from the old days

05:18.235 --> 05:20.528
still working is the senator!

05:23.908 --> 05:25.909
Place has sure changed.

05:26.744 --> 05:30.914
Churches, high school, shops.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.334
Well, the railroad done that.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.546
Desert's still the same.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.511
The cactus rose is in blossom.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.764
Maybe...

05:51.435 --> 05:55.271
Maybe you'd like to take
a ride out desert way

05:55.397 --> 05:57.232
and maybe look around.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.194
Maybe.

06:40.693 --> 06:43.695
You knew where I wanted to go,
didn't you?

06:43.821 --> 06:47.156
Well, you said you wanted
to see the cactus blossoms.

06:48.450 --> 06:51.536
There's his house down there,
what's left of it.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.454
Blossoms all around it.

06:57.334 --> 07:01.170
He never did finish that room
he started to build on, did he?

07:02.715 --> 07:04.340
No.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.968
Oh, well, you know all about that.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.351
There's a lovely one there.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.659
Whoa!

07:56.477 --> 08:02.106
Well, gentlemen, I promised myself
this trip I would not talk politics,

08:02.191 --> 08:05.276
and look here,
that's just about all I've been doing.

08:05.361 --> 08:09.155
Surely you're going to Capitol City
and talk to the assembly?

08:09.239 --> 08:12.158
Not this trip. This is purely personal.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.496
Purely personal?
That isn't good enough for my readers.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.666
Why did you come to Shinbone?
No mystery, is there?

08:19.750 --> 08:20.792
No.

08:21.877 --> 08:24.045
No, there's no mystery.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.589
I'm here to go to a funeral.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.549
Funeral?

08:29.093 --> 08:30.718
Who's dead, sir?

08:31.345 --> 08:33.054
No, sir. I...

08:34.222 --> 08:36.765
A man by the name of Tom Doniphon.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.561
Oh, there's my good wife. I'll...

08:41.105 --> 08:43.563
I've enjoyed the visit, gentlemen.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.450
Tom Doniphon?

09:21.145 --> 09:23.855
- Hello, Clute.
- Why, Rance!

09:24.273 --> 09:27.150
Ransom Stoddard! And Miss Hallie!

09:27.234 --> 09:29.694
Gosh, Senator, I didn't think...

09:29.778 --> 09:32.613
Why didn't you let me know
they was coming?

09:32.698 --> 09:35.032
Gosh, I'd have had
a real bang-up funeral.

09:35.451 --> 09:38.619
Folks from all over, everywhere,
would have come.

09:57.973 --> 10:02.351
The county's gonna bury him, you know.
I won't make a nickel out of it.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.377
Pompey?

10:43.018 --> 10:44.477
Miss Hallie.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.605
Pompey, I'm sorry.

11:02.538 --> 11:04.580
Maybe you'd like to...

11:14.091 --> 11:15.633
Where are his boots?

11:15.759 --> 11:17.009
Well, I thought...

11:17.094 --> 11:21.138
They was an awful nice pair of boots,
almost brand-new, and I thought...

11:21.223 --> 11:26.102
Put his boots on, Clute,
and his gun belt and his spurs.

11:26.436 --> 11:30.189
He didn't carry no handgun, Rance.
He didn't for years.

11:30.566 --> 11:32.066
Yeah, sure.

12:02.472 --> 12:05.224
Sir, I don't wish to intrude,

12:05.726 --> 12:08.227
but a United States senator is news.

12:09.104 --> 12:12.815
I'm the editor of a newspaper
with a state-wide circulation.

12:13.984 --> 12:16.402
I've got a responsibility to know why

12:16.486 --> 12:19.697
you came all the way down here
to bury a man.

12:19.781 --> 12:23.659
You can't say his name
was Tom Doniphon and leave it at that.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.370
Who was Tom Doniphon?

12:27.331 --> 12:31.834
He was a friend, Mr Scott,
and we'd like to be left alone.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.085
Scott, let's go.

12:33.170 --> 12:36.255
I'm sorry, Senator. That's not enough.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.966
I have a right to have the story.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.731
Yes, I guess maybe you have.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.879
Of course, this story
not only concerns me.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.675
Old Pompey in there, Link,
they were part of it.

13:21.385 --> 13:24.845
But I suppose I'm the only one
who can tell it through.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.140
I read about the old days
in the paper's files.

13:28.225 --> 13:31.185
- There was no mention...
- You're a young man!

13:31.603 --> 13:33.104
A young man.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.856
You only know it
since the railroad came.

13:35.941 --> 13:39.402
A lot different then.
A lot different before, Mr Scott.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.112
A lot different.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.907
First time I came to Shinbone,
I came by stagecoach.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.868
A lot like that one right there.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.371
Well...

13:53.417 --> 13:55.543
Could be the same one.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.381
Could be the same one.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.801
Overland...
Say, I think it is the same one!

14:05.303 --> 14:06.929
Well, I declare.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.183
Well, I declare.

14:11.893 --> 14:15.438
I was just a youngster,
fresh out of law school,

14:16.273 --> 14:19.859
bag full of law books
and my father's gold watch,

14:20.402 --> 14:22.611
$14.80 in cash.

14:23.780 --> 14:28.242
I had taken
Horace Greeley's advice literally,

14:29.453 --> 14:32.163
"Go west, young man, go west,

14:32.664 --> 14:36.792
"and seek fame, fortune, adventure."

14:42.758 --> 14:44.675
Stand and deliver!

15:01.985 --> 15:04.028
Shotgun, shuck your shells.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.202
Throw down the cash box.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.496
Now!

15:14.581 --> 15:17.666
All right.
Get the passengers out of the coach.

15:45.028 --> 15:48.030
Looks like slim passenger pickings,
but lift their wallets anyway.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.916
- I'll take that pin, too.
- No. Please.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.043
My dead husband gave it to me.

16:01.128 --> 16:04.380
- Please!
- A widow, huh? I'll take it anyway.

16:04.464 --> 16:08.008
Take your hands off!
What kind of men are you?

16:08.385 --> 16:10.302
This kind, dude!

16:14.891 --> 16:17.393
Now, what kind of man are you, dude?

16:19.896 --> 16:25.067
I am an attorney-at-law,
and I'm duly licensed by the territory.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.988
You may have us now,
but I'll see you in jail for this!

16:29.823 --> 16:30.906
Jail?

16:35.412 --> 16:36.996
- Stop it! You'll kill him!
- Get him out of here!

16:37.080 --> 16:39.415
Get in that coach! Go on, move!

16:39.833 --> 16:42.710
Get in there! You, too!

16:42.961 --> 16:45.129
- Come on, inside!
- He could die out there!

16:45.213 --> 16:47.089
We'll send him flowers!

16:48.550 --> 16:50.176
Chico, cut the leaders!

17:06.233 --> 17:07.776
Get going!

17:16.786 --> 17:19.829
Put that stuff in here
and get to your horses. Hurry!

17:19.915 --> 17:21.248
A book?

17:23.460 --> 17:24.627
Law?

17:46.149 --> 17:47.775
Lawyer, huh?

17:51.446 --> 17:54.114
Well, I'll teach you law...

17:54.199 --> 17:55.950
Western law.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.874
Let's get out of here.

18:03.959 --> 18:06.418
Come on. Come on!

18:52.841 --> 18:54.174
Hallie!

18:54.676 --> 18:57.219
Hallie! Wake up, gal!

19:04.019 --> 19:05.477
Tom Doniphon!

19:05.562 --> 19:07.896
It's 5:30 in the morning!
What's wrong with you?

19:07.981 --> 19:11.233
We've got a man down here ambushed.
And bushed!

19:11.568 --> 19:14.069
Like to die if we don't get care for him.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.237
Oh.

19:25.248 --> 19:28.250
- It's the man from the hold-up.
- That's right.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.254
How did you know?

19:32.380 --> 19:35.174
Stagecoach stopped by
to notify the marshal.

19:35.258 --> 19:36.925
Link Appleyard?

19:37.260 --> 19:40.596
Don't stand there gossiping.
Get him inside. Pompey!

19:41.306 --> 19:43.349
Think you can make it, pilgrim?

19:43.433 --> 19:45.309
Pick him up, Pompey.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.951
Put him on the couch.

20:16.966 --> 20:20.260
Tom, he's hurt real bad.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.037
Thanks, Pompey.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.501
Poor man.

20:53.044 --> 20:57.589
Beaten, whipped, and kicked,
and just for trying to protect a woman.

20:57.966 --> 21:02.010
- How's that again?
- Stage driver told us all about it.

21:04.013 --> 21:09.017
Well, Pompey, looks like
we got ourselves a ladies' man.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.858
Hallie, we...

21:16.067 --> 21:18.193
- Get some bandage.
- But...

21:18.319 --> 21:20.195
I'll take care of him.

21:27.162 --> 21:28.662
Hey...

21:28.746 --> 21:31.790
Pilgrim, you're gonna need
a couple of stitches.

21:31.875 --> 21:34.042
Pompey, go find Doc Willoughby.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.378
If he's sober, bring him back.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.341
Oh.

21:43.887 --> 21:46.597
Nora, sorry to bust in on you like this.

21:46.681 --> 21:48.474
He's in trouble.

21:48.558 --> 21:50.726
Such a beating.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.770
This is just simply terrible.

21:53.855 --> 21:56.482
By golly, I'm going to get the marshal.

21:56.566 --> 22:00.068
You want coffee?
I make some breakfast. Hallie?

22:06.242 --> 22:09.036
Whoa! Take her easy there, pilgrim.

22:11.623 --> 22:13.165
You all right?

22:35.647 --> 22:37.105
Here we are.

22:38.441 --> 22:39.816
Drink this.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.916
- Is that coffee?
- Ja, coffee and aquavit.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.919
- Swedish brandy. Good for you.
- Oh. Oh, no.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.879
I don't care for that.

23:01.589 --> 23:04.633
Here, you must drink.
That make you feel better.

23:06.135 --> 23:10.222
It ain't mannerly out west
to let a fellow drink by himself.

23:21.484 --> 23:24.987
- All right if I smoke, ain't it?
- Sure. Go right ahead.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.593
Good. Now you will feel stronger.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.344
Thank you, ma'am.

23:51.014 --> 23:52.806
Took my watch.

23:52.890 --> 23:56.101
My money's gone.
Every cent I had in the world.

23:56.561 --> 23:58.937
Well, don't fret about that, pilgrim.

23:59.063 --> 24:02.816
You can eat here
until you get back on your feet.

24:03.318 --> 24:06.445
- My credit's still good, Nora?
- Ja, Tom.

24:09.824 --> 24:12.034
Lie down. Please lie down.

24:12.327 --> 24:14.244
No. No, not now.

24:16.831 --> 24:20.584
Not now. I... I...
I've got something to do.

24:22.545 --> 24:24.796
Got something to do.

24:26.883 --> 24:29.968
What... What did you
say his name was?

24:31.054 --> 24:33.764
The... The man
with the silver-knobbed whip?

24:33.973 --> 24:37.851
I said Liberty Valance,
but if that's what you got to do,

24:38.728 --> 24:41.063
you better start packing a handgun.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.650
A gun? I don't want a gun.

24:45.902 --> 24:49.279
I don't want a gun.
I don't want to kill him.

24:50.073 --> 24:51.865
I want to put him in jail.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.575
Oh.

24:54.911 --> 24:57.788
I know those law books
mean a lot to you,

24:57.872 --> 24:59.456
but not out here.

24:59.582 --> 25:02.292
Out here,
a man settles his own problems.

25:04.170 --> 25:07.756
Yeah, but do you know
what you're saying to me?

25:08.591 --> 25:11.301
You know, you're... You're saying

25:11.427 --> 25:15.097
just exactly what Liberty Valance said.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.851
What kind of community
have I come to here?

25:20.061 --> 25:22.813
You all seem to know about
this Liberty Valance.

25:22.897 --> 25:26.316
He's a no-good,
gun-packing, murdering thief,

25:26.901 --> 25:30.112
but the only advice you give me
is to carry a gun.

25:30.446 --> 25:32.197
Well, I'm a lawyer!

25:32.824 --> 25:35.450
Ransom Stoddard, Attorney-at-Law.

25:36.661 --> 25:39.955
And the law is the only...

25:41.874 --> 25:45.460
A little law and order around Shinbone
wouldn't hurt anyone.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.087
All right, Hallie.

25:53.761 --> 25:57.889
Arrest this man! Arrest him!
Nobody seems to want...

25:57.974 --> 25:59.558
Well.

25:59.642 --> 26:02.686
Here comes Mr Law and Order himself.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.604
He's hurt bad.

26:05.356 --> 26:08.442
What are you dragging me
here for, Peter?

26:08.526 --> 26:12.487
Ain't being up all night on account
of this hold-up business...

26:13.656 --> 26:16.408
- Well, who's this?
- The man from the hold-up.

26:16.492 --> 26:20.245
- I knew I shouldn't have come over.
- Wait a minute, Marshal.

26:20.329 --> 26:24.499
Now, see here, Tom,
if he's got a formal complaint to make,

26:24.584 --> 26:26.543
he should make it to me.

26:26.627 --> 26:30.046
He just wants you
to put Liberty Valance in jail.

26:30.131 --> 26:31.715
Yeah, Liberty...

26:32.300 --> 26:35.260
Liberty Valance? Do you think I'm crazy?

26:35.344 --> 26:37.053
Tom, let me out of here.

26:37.138 --> 26:41.349
Hallie thinks he's right.
You'd better listen. He's a lawyer.

26:41.517 --> 26:44.269
Somebody better listen
to somebody about him!

26:44.353 --> 26:46.480
Eyes he's got like icicles.

26:46.564 --> 26:49.524
Mamma, Liberty Valance
rides into town...

26:49.776 --> 26:53.987
As long as he behaves himself
in this town, I ain't got no...

26:55.406 --> 26:56.698
Jurisdiction.

26:57.074 --> 27:00.076
Yeah, what he said. I ain't got none of it.

27:00.203 --> 27:02.788
You all know I'm only the Town Marshal.

27:02.872 --> 27:07.042
What Liberty does out on the road
ain't no business of mine.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.294
Ain't that right, Mr Lawyer?

27:10.004 --> 27:11.546
Well, I...

27:12.590 --> 27:16.426
Technically, I suppose the hold-up
is a territorial offence.

27:16.761 --> 27:18.595
You mean I'm right?

27:18.971 --> 27:20.931
Yes, Marshal, you're right.

27:21.015 --> 27:26.311
I knew it! I knew we'd be friends
the minute I stepped in here!

27:26.521 --> 27:30.982
Now, you folks all know that,
well, the jail's only got one cell,

27:31.067 --> 27:34.110
and the lock's broke, and I sleep in it.

27:34.195 --> 27:37.906
I should have known nothing would
happen when you came in here.

27:37.990 --> 27:41.034
Now get out,
you big old fat water buffalo!

27:41.118 --> 27:44.579
- We got work to do!
- Hallie, I ain't ate yet.

27:45.998 --> 27:50.669
Nora, I could sure use a snack
of six or seven of those eggs,

27:50.753 --> 27:53.171
and maybe a side order of bacon and...

27:53.256 --> 27:55.507
Hey, is that flapjack batter?

27:55.591 --> 27:57.467
On the cuff. Sit down.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.095
- Papa, get your pants on!
- Oh, yeah.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.430
Get out of the way! Sit down!

28:03.933 --> 28:05.100
Hallie?

28:08.479 --> 28:12.148
You know, you look mighty pretty
when you get mad.

28:14.318 --> 28:18.196
Like I say, you can eat here
till you get back on your feet.

28:18.281 --> 28:19.990
May I have your name?

28:21.951 --> 28:24.619
Doniphon. Tom Doniphon.

28:26.122 --> 28:28.999
Forget what I said about buying a gun.

28:29.292 --> 28:30.917
You're a tenderfoot.

28:31.460 --> 28:35.630
Liberty Valance is the toughest man
south of the Picketwire,

28:35.965 --> 28:37.465
next to me.

29:04.493 --> 29:06.953
Hot time in the old town tonight!

30:08.057 --> 30:09.349
Mr...

30:10.142 --> 30:11.559
Mr Peabody!

30:12.269 --> 30:14.062
Evening, Marshal.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.068
Whoa!

30:24.073 --> 30:28.034
Did you know that Liberty Valance
is in town tonight?

30:28.119 --> 30:30.870
I'd be a poor newspaperman indeed

30:30.955 --> 30:33.999
if I didn't know
what everybody else knows.

30:34.083 --> 30:37.419
I don't know what to do,
Mr Peabody, I swear.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.088
Do what you're paid to. Run him out!

30:40.172 --> 30:42.632
Run him out... Liberty... Me?

30:42.717 --> 30:45.760
- My advice to you as...
- Coroner.

30:46.220 --> 30:49.556
- And your personal...
- Physician!

30:50.224 --> 30:53.601
Is to get your supper and go to bed.
No charge.

30:55.438 --> 30:58.314
Sound advice, Marshal. Sound advice.

31:07.950 --> 31:11.745
Hallie, my love, where are you?
I await you, my dear.

31:11.829 --> 31:15.123
Good evening.
Saturday night, Mr Peabody.

31:15.207 --> 31:18.585
Better order early before those
drunks come from across the street.

31:18.669 --> 31:24.382
Hallie, please.
The proprieties concerning the cutlery.

31:24.592 --> 31:26.634
How many times have I told you,

31:26.719 --> 31:30.388
the fork goes to the left of the plate,
the knife goes...

31:30.473 --> 31:32.807
You superstitious or something?

31:33.976 --> 31:35.935
What are you having to eat?

31:36.103 --> 31:37.604
The usual.

31:37.688 --> 31:40.774
Steak, beans, potatoes,
and deep-dish apple pie.

31:42.318 --> 31:44.652
Three steaks with a lot of black.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.157
- All right.
- Lot of black-eyes, Hallie.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.825
All right, Kaintuck!

31:52.161 --> 31:54.746
Three steaks,
burnt black for the Lazy J boys.

31:54.830 --> 31:58.500
Heavy on the beans.
Usual for Mr Peabody with fixings.

31:59.001 --> 32:02.545
Steak, beans, potatoes.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.130
And deep-dish apple pie.

32:04.215 --> 32:08.051
Someday, he'll order something
different, and we'll all faint.

32:16.018 --> 32:18.937
Goodness, Rance,
aren't you finished yet?

32:19.021 --> 32:21.815
No wonder if your mind isn't on it.
Let me help.

32:21.899 --> 32:25.568
Hallie, I found it. I'll show...
No, my hands are wet.

32:25.653 --> 32:28.279
Get the book.
Come on, take the book a minute.

32:28.656 --> 32:31.032
Nora, Peter, come here and hear this.

32:31.158 --> 32:33.034
Now, get the book.

32:33.119 --> 32:36.287
Now, that place right here where it says,

32:36.539 --> 32:39.207
"Under the law of this territory."

32:39.375 --> 32:41.501
Hallie, you read it out loud.

32:41.585 --> 32:44.295
I got Liberty Valance
exactly where I want him.

32:44.713 --> 32:46.214
Just exactly where I want him.

32:46.841 --> 32:49.384
What's the matter? Go ahead. Read it.

32:51.387 --> 32:52.762
I can't.

32:55.057 --> 32:56.516
What?

32:56.600 --> 32:58.601
You... Well, why not?

32:59.895 --> 33:03.231
Well, I never had the schooling,
that's why not.

33:05.442 --> 33:06.693
Well.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.783
You mean you can't read at all?

33:15.828 --> 33:19.497
No. I can't read, and I can't write.

33:19.874 --> 33:21.416
Here, take your book.

33:21.542 --> 33:24.294
For heaven's sakes,
isn't Mr Peabody's order ready?

33:24.378 --> 33:25.962
Oh, no.

33:26.422 --> 33:28.923
- Hallie...
- Not enough beans on it.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.595
Hallie, I'm sorry.

33:34.805 --> 33:36.181
Hallie.

33:36.932 --> 33:39.017
I... I could teach you.

33:41.604 --> 33:43.104
What for?

33:43.230 --> 33:45.440
What good has reading
and writing done you?

33:45.524 --> 33:47.901
Look at you. In an apron!

33:52.364 --> 33:54.657
Be right with you, boys.

33:54.742 --> 33:58.203
I do look funny in this.
I didn't mean to hurt her.

33:58.287 --> 34:02.207
She'll get over it.
What is reading and writing for a girl?

34:02.416 --> 34:05.335
She'll make a wonderful wife
for the man she marries.

34:05.419 --> 34:09.880
Yeah. And if Tom Doniphon is smart,
he pops the question to Hallie

34:09.965 --> 34:14.510
before some busybody I am married to
upsets his bag of apples.

34:14.637 --> 34:17.764
Aw, you!
Eat supper before come the drunks.

34:17.848 --> 34:20.600
- But I'm not finished.
- Go sit down! Eat!

34:43.873 --> 34:47.377
Well, what you cooking,
steak and potatoes?

34:47.503 --> 34:51.589
I'm hungry.
Could I impose upon your hospitality?

34:51.674 --> 34:54.884
Just a couple of those steaks
and no beans.

34:55.219 --> 34:57.804
Hey, Marshal.
You're the man I'm looking for.

34:59.348 --> 35:00.932
Not so loud.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.892
And double on the potatoes.

35:03.018 --> 35:05.979
One steak for one marshal on the cuff.

35:09.984 --> 35:12.610
Marshal, I was wrong the other day,

35:12.695 --> 35:15.571
but I've been reading up, and there it is.

35:15.656 --> 35:19.200
I'll draw up the complaint,
take care of the details,

35:19.326 --> 35:22.453
but you do have jurisdiction,
it says so right there.

35:22.621 --> 35:26.249
The next time he sets foot
in this town, you arrest him.

35:27.876 --> 35:30.086
Anything you say, Mr Stoddard.

35:30.212 --> 35:32.714
I'll be tickled to death to...

35:35.217 --> 35:37.552
What was that? Arrest who?

35:37.886 --> 35:39.220
Liberty Valance.

35:40.055 --> 35:42.223
Arrest Liberty...

35:42.850 --> 35:45.059
You mean Liberty Valance?

35:45.728 --> 35:48.896
Just when I was starting
to get my appetite back.

35:49.356 --> 35:52.025
- A lot of black-eyes.
- Right, right.

35:52.401 --> 35:56.029
Steaks for the Brophy boys
with black-eyed peas. Burn 'em.

35:56.113 --> 35:58.906
- They're sober tonight, too.
- Burn four.

36:08.751 --> 36:10.835
Here's the supper for Rance.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.675
- Thank you, Hallie.
- Oh, sit down!

36:17.760 --> 36:20.803
The way you pop up
every time a girl speaks to you!

36:20.888 --> 36:24.599
- You get in the habit.
- Rance, do you think I could?

36:24.767 --> 36:27.602
I mean, grown-up and all?
Could I learn to read?

36:28.395 --> 36:31.064
Why, sure you can, Hallie.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.899
Why, there's nothing to it.

36:32.983 --> 36:35.860
It'd be easy. Can you learn to read?

36:35.944 --> 36:37.862
Why, I can teach you.

36:37.946 --> 36:40.865
A smart girl like you?
Of course you can.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.367
Do you want to try?

36:43.577 --> 36:45.912
It's awful worrisome not knowing how.

36:45.996 --> 36:48.456
I know the Good Book
from preacher talk,

36:48.540 --> 36:51.417
but it'd be a soul comfort
to read it myself.

36:51.502 --> 36:53.711
Hallie, I'll teach you how.

36:53.796 --> 36:56.672
In no time, you'll be reading everything.

36:56.757 --> 37:00.134
Well... Well...

37:00.844 --> 37:03.596
Hallie, can I have just one more steak?

37:05.349 --> 37:07.475
One steak on the cuff!

37:27.037 --> 37:28.830
All right, all right.

37:31.834 --> 37:33.376
Excuse me.

37:36.547 --> 37:39.257
- Nora, did you hear the news?
- No.

37:39.341 --> 37:42.093
- Rance'll learn me to read.
- "Teach me to read."

37:42.177 --> 37:43.886
Teach me to read.

37:46.223 --> 37:49.016
I cannot say my ABC in Swedish.

37:50.018 --> 37:52.103
Maybe you can teach me in English.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.772
Sure, Nora.
You can be my second pupil.

37:54.857 --> 37:57.191
Hal's my first. You'll be my second.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.861
Peter, you hear that? Peter!

38:02.531 --> 38:06.492
Well, pilgrim,
I see you're still protecting the ladies.

38:07.035 --> 38:10.246
Why, Tom, look at you.
You're all dressed up.

38:10.330 --> 38:12.957
- It's Saturday night.
- Don't you look handsome!

38:13.041 --> 38:17.545
- Oh, I brought you a present.
- Tom!

38:17.796 --> 38:20.131
Prettiest cactus rose I ever did see.

38:20.215 --> 38:22.675
It is a beauty. Look at it, Nora.

38:23.093 --> 38:27.138
- Should look nice in your garden.
- But it should go in now...

38:27.222 --> 38:30.892
- I'll be pleased to plant that.
- Oh, thank you, Pompey.

38:31.268 --> 38:34.228
Oh, the Hashknife group just arrived.
Burn eight.

38:36.106 --> 38:38.524
Not too close
to the ocotillo bush, Pompey.

38:38.609 --> 38:40.026
Yes, ma'am.

38:44.198 --> 38:47.909
"Ransom Stoddard, Attorney-at-Law."

38:49.703 --> 38:52.371
You're a persistent cuss, pilgrim.

38:52.456 --> 38:55.082
You really aim to hang that up outside?

38:55.584 --> 38:57.293
That's why I painted it.

38:58.045 --> 39:00.129
Well, take some advice, pilgrim.

39:00.422 --> 39:04.133
You put that thing up,
you'll have to defend it with a gun,

39:04.593 --> 39:07.011
and you ain't exactly the type.

39:10.265 --> 39:11.641
Comin' up.

39:13.477 --> 39:15.019
Well, thank you.

39:15.103 --> 39:18.773
A girl needs six hands
on Saturday night, and it's so hot.

39:18.982 --> 39:20.358
Look at me.

39:20.442 --> 39:24.153
Any more colour and you'd be prettier
than that cactus rose.

39:24.321 --> 39:27.156
Why, Tom, that's mighty flattering.

39:28.075 --> 39:31.327
Burn me a good, thick one, Pete,
meat and potatoes.

39:32.162 --> 39:34.497
- Hello, Kaintuck.
- Evening, Tom.

39:40.462 --> 39:43.756
- Tom.
- Object to company, Mr Peabody?

39:43.840 --> 39:46.592
Not to yours, Tom. Sit down, sit down.

39:51.473 --> 39:53.975
I suppose you know
who's across the street?

39:55.143 --> 39:57.812
Yeah. I hear he sent word on ahead.

39:58.814 --> 40:03.359
He won't like what the town's
been saying about him and that hold-up.

40:06.363 --> 40:07.863
How about you, Kaintuck?

40:07.990 --> 40:09.782
- I'd like a...
- Steak?

40:09.992 --> 40:11.659
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well-burnt.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.911
- And deep...
- Deep-dish apple pie.

40:13.996 --> 40:15.830
- Yeah.
- Coming up.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.918
Mighty nice girl, that Hallie.
Mighty pretty.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.422
I agree with you, sir.

40:24.506 --> 40:26.090
Just told her so.

40:26.174 --> 40:29.135
What? Do I hear wedding bells?

40:29.261 --> 40:33.347
- When can I print the story?
- Don't rush me, Mr Editor.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.975
Don't rush me.

40:41.982 --> 40:44.650
There's your cactus rose. Sure is pretty.

40:44.735 --> 40:46.819
Thank you, Pompey. It is pretty.

40:46.903 --> 40:49.614
- Go in and get supper.
- Thank you, ma'am.

40:51.450 --> 40:52.867
Oh, Rance.

40:56.330 --> 40:57.455
Look at that.

40:57.539 --> 41:00.124
Isn't that the prettiest thing
you ever saw?

41:00.208 --> 41:01.709
Yeah, it's very pretty.

41:04.880 --> 41:07.256
Did you ever see a real rose?

41:08.550 --> 41:09.592
No.

41:12.095 --> 41:14.388
But someday if they dam the river,

41:14.514 --> 41:17.183
we'll have water and all kinds of flowers.

41:17.267 --> 41:18.517
Hallie!

41:25.400 --> 41:28.611
When you finish the dishes,
will you help wait tables?

41:28.695 --> 41:31.656
- Sure.
- Washing dishes is enough for him.

41:31.740 --> 41:35.409
- A man waiting on tables?
- Well, no, I'd be glad to help.

41:36.620 --> 41:38.204
Be glad to.

41:38.747 --> 41:40.581
I thought we was busy.

42:18.036 --> 42:21.122
Well, these steaks look done
just right for us.

42:23.333 --> 42:26.419
You cowhands ain't in no hurry
to eat, are you?

42:29.131 --> 42:30.756
Well, are you?

42:32.426 --> 42:35.302
I guess we could do with another drink.

42:37.639 --> 42:40.474
That's right neighbourly of you, partner.

42:45.647 --> 42:47.523
Especially after all the lies

42:47.649 --> 42:50.693
I hear folks been saying
about Liberty Valance.

42:53.655 --> 42:55.614
Oh, wait a minute!

42:56.700 --> 42:58.951
One of Mamma's pies for Tom.

43:15.385 --> 43:16.552
Well...

43:18.930 --> 43:21.098
Looky at the new waitress.

43:37.699 --> 43:39.950
That's my steak, Valance.

43:45.415 --> 43:48.918
You heard him, dude. Pick it up.

43:51.046 --> 43:52.797
- No!
- Pilgrim, hold it.

43:52.881 --> 43:56.550
I said you, Valance. You pick it up.

43:57.636 --> 43:59.762
Three against one, Doniphon.

44:00.889 --> 44:04.225
My boy Pompey in the kitchen door.

44:12.526 --> 44:14.318
I'll get it, Liberty.

44:19.658 --> 44:21.408
I said you, Liberty.

44:22.744 --> 44:24.328
You pick it up.

44:27.457 --> 44:30.709
What's the matter?
Everybody here kill-crazy?

44:30.919 --> 44:32.086
Here!

44:35.465 --> 44:36.715
There!

44:36.925 --> 44:38.259
There!

44:40.262 --> 44:42.638
Now! It's picked up!

44:47.936 --> 44:51.313
Why don't you get yourself
a fresh steak on me?

44:56.695 --> 44:58.487
Show's over for now.

45:02.701 --> 45:04.201
Try it, Liberty.

45:05.662 --> 45:07.121
Just try it.

45:12.752 --> 45:14.295
Well, get out!

46:04.679 --> 46:07.097
Now, I wonder what scared him off.

46:07.182 --> 46:08.641
You know what!

46:08.725 --> 46:11.060
The spectacle of law and order here

46:11.144 --> 46:13.938
rising up out of the gravy
and the mashed potatoes!

46:14.022 --> 46:16.899
All right, all right, you made your point.

46:17.150 --> 46:18.943
The gun scared him off.

46:19.361 --> 46:21.570
Pompey's gun, your gun, Tom.

46:22.197 --> 46:24.698
Why did you interfere? He tripped me.

46:24.824 --> 46:26.492
It was my steak.

46:26.576 --> 46:29.078
And you would have killed him for it!

46:29.204 --> 46:32.915
Or he would have killed you
over one measly steak!

46:33.375 --> 46:37.086
- That's why I picked it up!
- Thanks for saving my life, pilgrim.

46:37.170 --> 46:39.213
That isn't why I did it!

46:40.882 --> 46:43.008
Nobody fights my battles.

47:12.414 --> 47:13.998
Rance, I'm sorry.

47:29.806 --> 47:33.600
Peter, I'm not in the habit
of eating my steak off the floor.

47:38.314 --> 47:40.399
Well, cool off, pilgrim.

47:40.775 --> 47:43.110
It's all over. Nobody got hurt.

47:43.486 --> 47:46.321
It is not all over,
and everybody here knows it.

47:46.448 --> 47:49.658
- He'll be back.
- He will, but not after me.

47:49.784 --> 47:51.201
After you, pilgrim.

47:51.286 --> 47:54.288
And you can't shoot back
with a law book.

47:54.956 --> 47:57.082
What Peabody's saying is,

47:57.167 --> 48:00.669
if you want to stay healthy,
there's two ways to do it.

48:00.920 --> 48:04.048
Buy a gun or leave the territory,
is that what he meant?

48:04.132 --> 48:06.467
- That's it, pilgrim.
- By golly...

48:06.968 --> 48:10.637
I'd hate to see you go.
You're news, Mr Stoddard,

48:10.722 --> 48:13.307
and you've been news
ever since you hit town.

48:13.808 --> 48:16.810
"Ransom Stoddard, Attorney-at-Law."

48:17.145 --> 48:20.731
Oh. I didn't mean to hurt
your feelings out there.

48:22.025 --> 48:23.901
Hey, I'll tell you what.

48:23.985 --> 48:25.569
You decide to stick around,

48:25.653 --> 48:29.364
and I'll let you hang this thing
outside the newspaper office,

48:29.449 --> 48:31.950
rent-free, for as long as it lasts.

48:32.327 --> 48:33.452
No.

48:34.037 --> 48:37.122
No. The first time
Liberty rides into town,

48:37.207 --> 48:40.626
he'll shoot it to pieces,
and the whole newspaper office.

48:40.710 --> 48:42.878
How about that, Mr Peabody?

48:43.379 --> 48:46.298
Well, that'd be news.

48:46.883 --> 48:49.134
I accept your offer, Mr Peabody.

48:49.219 --> 48:51.804
How about letting me
hang that up tomorrow?

48:51.888 --> 48:53.639
Huh? Tomorrow?

48:55.642 --> 48:57.810
- Well, of course.
- Thank you.

48:57.894 --> 48:59.228
Why not?

49:03.858 --> 49:06.860
I'm staying,
and I'm not buying a gun either.

49:08.071 --> 49:10.072
Well, good luck, pilgrim.

49:11.825 --> 49:15.160
Oh, Hallie,
I'll be out of town for a while,

49:15.245 --> 49:17.955
north of the Picketwire, horse-trading.

49:20.583 --> 49:22.084
Goodbye, Tom.

49:25.088 --> 49:28.048
Oh, and take note
of what goes on around town

49:28.216 --> 49:30.134
because by the time I get back,

49:30.218 --> 49:33.053
there won't be
no newspaper to read it in.

50:05.253 --> 50:07.337
Well, any news?

50:07.422 --> 50:09.715
Hansons had a baby boy, eight pounds.

50:09.799 --> 50:12.134
- But not twins?
- Not twins.

50:12.719 --> 50:15.596
Here, I got this list of voters for you.

50:15.930 --> 50:19.183
There are 37 new registrations
over last year,

50:19.267 --> 50:21.977
and not one single one needed a lawyer.

50:22.061 --> 50:24.438
Oh. 37, huh?

50:24.981 --> 50:28.358
Well, by golly!
If we can only get them to vote,

50:28.443 --> 50:31.111
maybe we can handle
those cattle barons

50:31.196 --> 50:33.530
from across the Picketwire, huh?

50:54.093 --> 50:57.596
Well, did you write this, Mr Peabody?

50:59.140 --> 51:00.265
Yeah.

51:03.186 --> 51:04.978
Well, this is great.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.857
You like it?

51:09.359 --> 51:11.401
This thing's just great.

51:12.987 --> 51:13.987
Well...

51:15.573 --> 51:19.284
As my old boss,
Horace Greeley, used to say,

51:19.452 --> 51:21.370
"We'll tear their hearts out."

51:24.457 --> 51:26.333
I'll be right there.

51:33.758 --> 51:35.926
Let me have this. I'll use it in class.

51:36.010 --> 51:37.135
Well...

51:40.306 --> 51:42.683
Good morning. I'm sorry I'm late.

51:43.351 --> 51:46.895
A teacher should never be late for class.
Take your seats.

51:47.272 --> 51:50.107
Well, this is quite a turnout
this morning.

51:50.525 --> 51:52.442
We have more pupils every day.

51:52.527 --> 51:54.069
- Morning, Marshal.
- Morning, Rance.

51:54.153 --> 51:56.655
- How are you feeling?
- Just fine, fine.

51:56.906 --> 51:59.783
- Your head cold?
- Oh, no, no. I have a...

52:01.995 --> 52:05.831
Excuse me. I just wanted to see
how Julietta was doing.

52:05.915 --> 52:09.126
Julietta's doing fine.

52:09.377 --> 52:12.379
How's the rest of my family
doing in reading?

52:12.505 --> 52:15.632
Well, Hallie's in charge
of the kindergarten.

52:15.883 --> 52:18.885
Hallie, why don't you
run through the ABCs?

52:23.891 --> 52:25.726
All right, you ready?

52:26.394 --> 52:29.688
One, two, three.

52:30.440 --> 52:34.443
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

52:34.569 --> 52:38.238
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P

52:38.573 --> 52:42.242
Q, R, S and T, U, V

52:42.785 --> 52:46.204
W, X and Y and Z

52:46.581 --> 52:50.334
Now I know my ABCs

52:50.752 --> 52:54.087
Tell me what you think of me

52:54.422 --> 52:56.965
Well, that was just fine, just fine.

52:57.884 --> 53:00.552
Well, I see a couple more
new pupils back there.

53:00.636 --> 53:05.265
Highpockets, Kaintuck,
you fellas really serious about readin'?

53:05.558 --> 53:07.476
Go on. Stand up. Tell him.

53:09.937 --> 53:13.023
Well, Miss Hallie,

53:13.107 --> 53:15.484
she talked such a right smart argument

53:15.610 --> 53:19.404
to the Lazy J... The boss of the Lazy J...

53:19.822 --> 53:24.117
Well, he just up and told
all the hands to cut the cards

53:24.202 --> 53:27.913
to see who come to school, and I lost.

53:28.081 --> 53:32.084
I see. Well, we'll try...
Good morning, Mr Carruthers.

53:32.168 --> 53:36.588
Good morning. Caught him
playing hookey again, fishing.

53:36.839 --> 53:38.382
Catch anything, Herbert?

53:38.466 --> 53:41.551
- No, sir. They weren't biting.
- That's too bad.

53:41.636 --> 53:44.179
- Ain't you gonna whop him?
- He's too big.

53:44.263 --> 53:47.349
For the benefit of those
of you just starting,

53:48.309 --> 53:50.894
none of us in here smoke,
Mr Carruthers.

53:52.814 --> 53:54.147
Thank you.

53:54.816 --> 53:57.776
For those of you who have just started,

53:57.860 --> 54:01.238
I might explain to you
that we've begun the school

54:01.322 --> 54:03.698
by studying about our country

54:04.826 --> 54:06.660
and how it's governed.

54:07.537 --> 54:08.787
Now, let's see.

54:08.871 --> 54:10.539
Well, now, Nora...

54:11.582 --> 54:15.836
Would you tell the class what you've
learned about the United States?

54:21.300 --> 54:25.679
The United States is a republic

54:27.473 --> 54:29.349
and a republic

54:30.351 --> 54:33.353
is a state in which

54:35.231 --> 54:37.149
the people are the boss.

54:38.901 --> 54:40.485
That means us.

54:41.696 --> 54:46.700
And if the big shots in Washington
don't do like we want,

54:47.368 --> 54:50.203
we don't vote for them,
by golly, no more.

54:50.329 --> 54:52.414
- Any more!
- Any more.

54:52.999 --> 54:55.709
That's fine, Nora. That's just fine.

54:56.377 --> 54:59.796
Now, I wonder
if anybody in class remembers

54:59.881 --> 55:02.883
what the basic law of the land is called.

55:03.342 --> 55:05.177
You remember I told you

55:05.261 --> 55:08.430
it had to be added to
and changed sometimes

55:08.514 --> 55:10.307
by things called amendments.

55:10.391 --> 55:12.184
Does anybody remember?

55:12.268 --> 55:14.144
Julietta, your hand's always up.

55:14.228 --> 55:17.189
Here, let's... Pompey, you try this one.

55:23.070 --> 55:25.655
It was writ by
Mr Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.

55:25.740 --> 55:29.534
- "Was written", Pompey.
- Written by Mr Thomas Jefferson.

55:30.036 --> 55:33.747
- He called it the Constitution.
- Declaration of Independence.

55:33.831 --> 55:36.416
It begun with the words,

55:36.501 --> 55:40.378
"We hold these truths to be..."

55:41.088 --> 55:43.548
- Self-evident.
- Let him alone, Charlie.

55:43.633 --> 55:46.885
"Self-evident that..."

55:48.054 --> 55:50.472
"That all men are created equal."

55:53.267 --> 55:54.893
That's fine, Pompey.

55:54.977 --> 55:57.479
I knew that, but I plumb forgot it.

55:57.730 --> 56:01.608
A lot of people forget that part.
You did just fine, Pompey.

56:01.943 --> 56:03.026
Thank you.

56:03.110 --> 56:05.278
This law also states

56:05.363 --> 56:08.031
that the governing power
rests with the electorate.

56:08.115 --> 56:11.201
Now, that means you,
that means the people.

56:11.786 --> 56:16.456
And you exercise this power
through the vote. Now, then. Yes?

56:22.463 --> 56:24.965
Well, Hallie? Go right ahead, Hallie.

56:26.050 --> 56:30.470
Now, here is the best textbook
in the world.

56:30.555 --> 56:31.846
It's an honest newspaper.

56:31.931 --> 56:35.684
This is the Shinbone Star,
Dutton Peabody, Editor-in-Chief.

56:36.018 --> 56:39.729
And reading this ought to
bring home to everybody

56:39.814 --> 56:42.732
the importance of using that vote.

56:42.817 --> 56:46.236
Now, the headlines say,
"Cattlemen fight statehood.

56:46.320 --> 56:48.280
"Small homesteaders in danger."

56:48.364 --> 56:53.034
It says clearly that if big ranchers
north of the Picketwire River

56:53.119 --> 56:56.496
win their fight to keep this
territory in open reign,

56:56.581 --> 57:01.209
then all your truck farms and your corn,

57:01.294 --> 57:03.378
the small shopkeepers and everything,

57:03.462 --> 57:07.090
the future of your kids,
it will all be all over, be gone!

57:07.675 --> 57:10.677
And they call upon you in this article,

57:11.345 --> 57:15.765
they call upon you to unite
behind a real strong delegate

57:15.850 --> 57:19.352
and carry this fight to Washington
if necessary.

57:20.021 --> 57:21.354
Hello, Tom.

57:21.856 --> 57:24.024
Welcome back. You want to join us?

57:24.567 --> 57:26.276
I'm looking for Pompey.

57:26.861 --> 57:30.905
I've been away three weeks,
and there's no sashes or doors in yet.

57:30.990 --> 57:35.785
Why have you been wasting time here?
Get to work. Your schooling's over.

57:35.870 --> 57:39.497
Don't get rough with Pompey.
He's entitled to a...

57:39.582 --> 57:43.126
What I got to say to you
will be a whole lot rougher.

57:43.878 --> 57:47.547
The good editor here
has written some noble words,

57:47.673 --> 57:51.760
and you read 'em good,
but if you put that paper out,

57:51.844 --> 57:54.763
the streets of Shinbone
will be running with blood.

57:55.389 --> 57:58.141
Why are you against this, Tom,
you of all people?

57:58.225 --> 58:02.395
Aren't there more votes
south of the Picketwire than north?

58:02.521 --> 58:05.940
That's right, but votes
won't stand up against guns.

58:06.108 --> 58:08.568
Guns? What guns, Tom?

58:08.861 --> 58:12.947
You think Valance stays away
from here 'cause he's scared of you?

58:13.282 --> 58:16.242
He's recruiting hired guns
for the big ranchers.

58:16.410 --> 58:17.911
Julietta.

58:18.037 --> 58:19.788
Take the little ones home.

58:21.457 --> 58:22.832
Come on.

58:22.917 --> 58:26.711
Hallie, it would be a good idea
if you dismissed class.

58:26.796 --> 58:29.589
- Dismiss class?
- Go on. Dismiss them, please.

58:31.592 --> 58:34.302
Class dismissed! Same time tomorrow.

58:34.387 --> 58:36.346
You get to the store.

58:40.184 --> 58:42.644
This could get worse
than the sheep wars.

58:42.728 --> 58:46.481
- Will they start anything here?
- It's already started.

58:47.024 --> 58:49.275
Valance and his men
crossed the river yesterday,

58:49.360 --> 58:52.904
killed old man Holliday and his son.

58:53.531 --> 58:55.865
- You know that for a fact, Tom?
- I do.

58:56.117 --> 58:59.994
They tried to bushwhack me,
unfortunately for one of them.

59:00.204 --> 59:02.497
You gonna put that in your newspaper?

59:02.581 --> 59:04.708
It's news, and I'm a newspaperman.

59:04.792 --> 59:07.168
Print that, he'll kill you, sure as hell.

59:07.294 --> 59:08.712
You think they'll come here, Tom?

59:10.631 --> 59:13.591
They'll be here,
tomorrow or the next day,

59:13.676 --> 59:16.970
according to how much
who-hit-john they consume,

59:17.638 --> 59:21.725
but election day, pilgrim,
you can depend on it, they'll be here.

59:22.601 --> 59:24.269
Hallie, go back where you belong.

59:24.353 --> 59:26.771
I don't want you in no shooting gallery.

59:26.856 --> 59:29.149
Now, you listen to me, Tom Doniphon.

59:29.567 --> 59:32.527
What I do and where I go
is none of your business.

59:32.611 --> 59:34.154
You don't own me.

59:35.698 --> 59:40.160
Like I said, Hallie,
you're awful pretty when you get mad.

59:42.496 --> 59:43.621
Hal.

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:04.267
Rance, after all you've taught us,

01:00:04.351 --> 01:00:07.228
how can you say
we should knuckle under now?

01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:09.856
You heard what Tom said.

01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:13.318
When force threatens,
talk's no good any more.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.575
Hallie...

01:00:23.204 --> 01:00:26.164
Hallie, you go find Tom
and make it up to him.

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:27.373
He...

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:30.210
He's only trying to protect you.

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:12.585
Rance.

01:01:13.921 --> 01:01:15.255
Rance!

01:01:16.257 --> 01:01:18.216
Better let him go, Hallie.

01:01:21.554 --> 01:01:23.888
Why? Where's he going?

01:01:24.932 --> 01:01:27.433
He's gonna need
all the practice he can get.

01:01:28.602 --> 01:01:32.105
Practice? What are you talking about?

01:01:36.652 --> 01:01:38.945
I might as well let you know now.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:43.241
When he decided to come in with me,
I let him have a gun of mine.

01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:48.121
He's been going out in the country
twice a week, practising, ever since.

01:01:49.832 --> 01:01:53.543
You mean he's going to face up
to Liberty, Liberty Valance?

01:01:54.503 --> 01:01:55.545
Rance?

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.922
That's the only way I can figure it.

01:01:58.007 --> 01:02:01.467
He never would discuss it.
He just keeps on

01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:04.137
practising.

01:02:13.022 --> 01:02:15.481
Tom! Tom Doniphon!

01:02:22.907 --> 01:02:24.490
Hey, professor.

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:28.453
Where you going?

01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:35.835
I want to talk to you.

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:37.587
Tom, I'm going...

01:03:00.653 --> 01:03:04.197
Step down, pilgrim. Take a look.

01:03:09.578 --> 01:03:13.122
Well, all right, Tom,
what are you trying to tell me?

01:03:13.374 --> 01:03:16.042
I'm telling you that Hallie's my girl.

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:22.048
I'm building that new room and porch
for her for when we get married.

01:03:23.384 --> 01:03:26.678
Tom, everybody pretty much
takes that for granted.

01:03:27.012 --> 01:03:30.223
Everybody except Hallie, maybe you.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:34.394
That's a damn lie, and you know it.

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:40.858
Then why did she come to me
fretting herself sick

01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:44.654
because you were gonna get killed
facing up to Liberty Valance?

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:47.490
- I never told her.
- Well, Peabody did.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.118
I think you're bluffing.

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:54.998
I'm not bluffing about anything.
Wait a minute, Tom. What?

01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:56.791
Pompey.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.628
Bring two or three of those paint cans.

01:04:08.262 --> 01:04:10.138
- You got a gun?
- Yes...

01:04:10.222 --> 01:04:11.431
Get it.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.648
Come on.

01:04:25.904 --> 01:04:27.739
All right, gunslinger.

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:33.661
Hit that can.

01:04:35.456 --> 01:04:36.831
Pretty far.

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.584
Pilgrim...

01:04:40.961 --> 01:04:43.463
- You got to cock it first.
- I forgot.

01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:54.265
Balance it light in your hand
and don't jerk the trigger.

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:57.518
- Squeeze.
- You don't have to coach me.

01:05:07.488 --> 01:05:09.864
Pompey, bring me those cans.

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:14.243
Give me that thing.
I'll show you how easy it is.

01:05:15.996 --> 01:05:19.957
Take these cans,
put 'em on those three posts.

01:05:22.503 --> 01:05:23.878
Go ahead.

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:32.136
That's it. That first post.

01:05:32.638 --> 01:05:34.430
- There?
- That's right.

01:05:40.354 --> 01:05:41.979
Not there!

01:05:42.481 --> 01:05:43.898
On the far post.

01:05:45.192 --> 01:05:46.651
That's right.

01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:51.155
Put that last one in the middle.

01:06:00.124 --> 01:06:01.207
Pilgrim!

01:06:15.681 --> 01:06:17.932
I hate tricks, pilgrim,

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:21.727
but that's what you're up against
with Valance.

01:06:22.271 --> 01:06:24.814
He's almost as fast as I am.

01:06:31.864 --> 01:06:34.991
I don't like tricks myself,
so that makes us even!

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:42.665
Hey, pilgrim.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:45.626
You forgot your popgun.

01:07:03.395 --> 01:07:05.146
I got you, Lyde.

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:07.106
Ruf McMard.

01:07:07.608 --> 01:07:09.066
Highpockets.

01:07:09.151 --> 01:07:10.943
Kaintuck. Kaintuck!

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:13.070
Leave the jug.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:30.421
Well, Hallie, I am so proud of him!

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.135
Dutton Peabody
exercising his franchise.

01:07:36.428 --> 01:07:38.804
- Dutton Peabody.
- Ransom Stoddard.

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:43.601
Rance, we'll need you
for some of that legal stuff later.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:46.979
Ransom Stoddard, Attorney-at-Law.
Check.

01:07:48.482 --> 01:07:51.567
Peter Ericson, American citizen.

01:07:51.652 --> 01:07:53.236
Go on in, Pete.

01:07:53.445 --> 01:07:55.821
- See you for supper, Pete?
- Yeah.

01:07:57.449 --> 01:07:59.075
Hey, Tom! Tom!

01:07:59.159 --> 01:08:00.534
Yeah, Pete?

01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:04.413
- Tom, look, we need a statehood!
- I agree.

01:08:04.498 --> 01:08:06.332
- A statehood!
- I agree.

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:11.587
- Herbert.
- Yes, sir?

01:08:11.672 --> 01:08:13.631
You're too young to vote.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:37.988
Greetings. Hey, excuse me. Excuse me.

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:40.491
The usual, Jack.

01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:42.201
Bar's closed.

01:08:42.536 --> 01:08:45.705
The bar is closed,
Mr Editor, during voting.

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:48.124
You can blame your lawyer friend.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:51.669
He says that's one of
the fundamental laws of democracy.

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:53.337
No exception.

01:08:54.089 --> 01:08:56.756
No exceptions for the working press?

01:08:57.050 --> 01:09:00.136
Oh, that's carrying democracy
much too far.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:03.805
- A small beer.
- Bar is closed.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:05.890
Give me that bungstarter.

01:09:07.394 --> 01:09:09.770
Since when is beer-drinking...

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:11.772
Tom. Tom!

01:09:14.526 --> 01:09:17.528
All right. Settle down!
Sit down, everybody!

01:09:17.612 --> 01:09:20.906
- Come on. Settle down.
- Settle down.

01:09:21.116 --> 01:09:22.616
Settle down.

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:28.205
Well, since our legal authority
closed the bar on us,

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:33.294
I propose that Ransom Stoddard,
Attorney-at-Law,

01:09:33.545 --> 01:09:35.504
come up here and run this meeting.

01:09:35.589 --> 01:09:37.965
- I second the motion!
- I third it!

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:57.318
Ransom. There he is. There he is.

01:10:02.908 --> 01:10:05.159
All right. All right. All right.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:10.247
All right, now, if that's what you want,
I can show you the rules.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:15.795
The meeting will come to order.
Settle down please, huh?

01:10:16.505 --> 01:10:19.215
Mr Peabody, would you keep
a record of the meeting?

01:10:19.299 --> 01:10:22.134
Oh, Rance, please.
There are other men...

01:10:22.302 --> 01:10:24.470
- Give me a drink!
- Bar's closed.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:27.556
- A beer's not drinking!
- Bar's closed.

01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:31.268
- Before we start...
- Sit down, Doctor, please!

01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:36.482
I have a pencil right here. Thank you.

01:10:36.608 --> 01:10:41.654
Now, you all know why we're here.

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:45.157
We're here to elect two delegates

01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:49.703
because a growing population south
of the Picketwire entitles us to two.

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:54.875
These two delegates will represent us
in the convention for statehood.

01:11:00.132 --> 01:11:01.757
You know the issue.

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:05.511
The cattle interests want to keep
this territory an open range.

01:11:05.637 --> 01:11:07.346
No!

01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:12.268
Ruled by their high-handed ideas,
whatever they are.

01:11:12.519 --> 01:11:15.563
And we,
that means everybody in this room,

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:17.815
we're for statehood!

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:22.486
We want statehood

01:11:22.571 --> 01:11:26.365
because it means the protection
of our farms and fences

01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:30.619
and it means schools for our children
and progress for the future!

01:11:32.456 --> 01:11:35.708
- Can I get...
- Shut... Just sit down, please.

01:11:36.251 --> 01:11:39.211
Now we'll proceed with the nominations.

01:11:40.255 --> 01:11:42.715
You can nominate
as many as you feel like,

01:11:43.008 --> 01:11:46.302
and in order to show you
how this procedure works,

01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:48.471
I'm going to step out of the chair.

01:11:48.555 --> 01:11:50.973
That's parliamentary law,
you can do that.

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:56.353
I'll step out of the chair
and make the first nomination.

01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:59.190
I'd like to nominate

01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:02.651
a man I think
is the only man in Shinbone

01:12:02.736 --> 01:12:06.655
who has the qualifications to lead
us in our fight for statehood.

01:12:07.032 --> 01:12:09.950
I could stand up here
and talk about him all day,

01:12:10.243 --> 01:12:14.246
but I know everybody here could too
and that's not necessary.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:17.458
I nominate Tom Doniphon.

01:12:30.931 --> 01:12:32.932
Come on, sit down!

01:12:33.225 --> 01:12:34.475
Sit down!

01:12:36.061 --> 01:12:39.438
Stop sucking on that cigar
and put that pencil away

01:12:39.773 --> 01:12:41.815
because I refuse the nomination.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.860
- You can't refuse now!
- Oh, yes, I can,

01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:48.155
because I got other plans,
personal plans.

01:12:48.907 --> 01:12:52.117
Mr Attorney. Go on with your meeting.

01:13:08.927 --> 01:13:12.221
You don't live south of the Picketwire.
You got no vote.

01:13:12.514 --> 01:13:14.765
I live where I hang my hat.

01:13:28.196 --> 01:13:30.698
Come on, move! Out of the way!

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.328
Get out.

01:13:41.376 --> 01:13:45.504
Well, hash slinger, what are you
looking so high and mighty about?

01:13:45.672 --> 01:13:49.216
He's running this here meeting,
or hadn't you heard?

01:13:49.509 --> 01:13:51.343
The whole shebang.

01:13:53.013 --> 01:13:55.514
I'd like to nominate the chairman,

01:13:56.349 --> 01:14:00.436
Mr Ransom Stoddard, as delegate
to the territorial convention.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.895
Wait a minute...

01:14:02.022 --> 01:14:03.772
I second that nomination,

01:14:03.857 --> 01:14:07.651
not only because he knows the law,
but he throws a good punch.

01:14:08.028 --> 01:14:11.488
Now, listen, all you sodbusters,
you hard-rock farmers.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:14.408
I aim to be the delegate.

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:15.951
You don't live south...

01:14:16.036 --> 01:14:18.120
Floyd, say your piece like I said.

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:20.331
I nominate Liberty Valance for delegate.

01:14:20.415 --> 01:14:23.709
- I second the nomination.
- Move the nominations be closed.

01:14:23.918 --> 01:14:25.836
Now, wait a minute.

01:14:26.004 --> 01:14:28.714
That ain't legal, is it, Mr Attorney?

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:30.007
No.

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:34.303
We need two good delegates
to Capitol City, Valance.

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:38.223
Two honest men.
We've got one in you, Mr Stoddard.

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:41.101
You looking for trouble, Doniphon?

01:14:41.186 --> 01:14:43.145
You helping me find some?

01:14:49.486 --> 01:14:51.195
You heard my motion, dude!

01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:54.490
All right. Put his name down.

01:14:54.574 --> 01:14:56.909
Liberty Valance, address unknown.

01:14:57.118 --> 01:15:00.371
- Have I got a right to speak?
- Go ahead, Highpockets.

01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:04.917
What about Mr Peabody? He can read
and write and he runs the newspaper.

01:15:05.377 --> 01:15:07.378
Yeah, and when he's drinking,

01:15:07.462 --> 01:15:11.548
why, he can talk the ears
off of a wooden Indian.

01:15:13.301 --> 01:15:14.718
I second the motion.

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:16.762
No...

01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:18.806
No! I...

01:15:19.766 --> 01:15:22.101
No, you don't. No!

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:26.563
I'm a newspaperman, not a politician!

01:15:26.648 --> 01:15:31.068
No, politicians are my meat!
I build 'em up. I tear 'em down.

01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:33.946
But I wouldn't be one. I couldn't be one!

01:15:34.489 --> 01:15:37.700
- It would destroy me! Give me a...
- Bar's closed.

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:43.539
Good people of Shinbone,
I'm your conscience.

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:47.167
I'm the still, small voice
that thunders in the night.

01:15:47.252 --> 01:15:49.878
I'm your watchdog
that howls against the wolves.

01:15:49.963 --> 01:15:53.382
I'm... I'm your father confessor!

01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:55.551
I'm...

01:15:56.761 --> 01:15:59.012
- What else am I?
- Town drunk?

01:16:02.809 --> 01:16:04.351
Dutton Peabody. Write it down.

01:16:04.436 --> 01:16:06.603
I move the nominations be closed.

01:16:06.688 --> 01:16:09.064
- I second the motion.
- All in favour?

01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:10.649
Aye!

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:13.318
Now we'll proceed with the election.

01:16:15.822 --> 01:16:19.533
You sodbusters are a brave bunch
when you're together,

01:16:19.617 --> 01:16:21.618
but don't vote any way now

01:16:21.703 --> 01:16:24.538
that you'll regret later
when you're alone.

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:33.464
All those in favour
of Ransom Stoddard as delegate,

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.923
raise your hands.

01:16:35.008 --> 01:16:36.842
Aye!

01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:41.805
All those in favour of Liberty Valance,
raise your hands.

01:16:55.236 --> 01:16:58.280
All those in favour of Dutton Peabody,
raise your hands!

01:16:58.364 --> 01:16:59.656
Aye!

01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:02.493
- This calls for a drink!
- The bar's closed.

01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:05.454
According to Mr Stoddard,
the bar's closed.

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:09.416
- Anything further on the election?
- No, the election's finished.

01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:11.627
Then the bar is open.

01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:22.346
That vote don't mean a thing.

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:26.266
Stay out of this. He's been hiding
behind your gun long enough.

01:17:26.351 --> 01:17:28.268
You got a choice, dishwasher.

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:31.939
Either you leave town,
or tonight be on that street alone.

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:35.901
You be there,
and don't make us come and get you.

01:17:51.376 --> 01:17:54.628
Well, he called it plain.

01:17:56.381 --> 01:17:59.633
Too bad you didn't
come to me sooner with that gun.

01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:05.180
Pilgrim.

01:18:05.765 --> 01:18:07.224
Come full dark,

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:10.435
Pompey will be at the Swedes' place
with a buckboard.

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:12.896
Why don't you get out of town?

01:18:14.774 --> 01:18:15.941
Thanks.

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:51.476
"Liberty Valance defeated."

01:18:52.437 --> 01:18:54.563
"D-E-F-E-E...

01:18:54.647 --> 01:18:57.691
"E-T-E-D?"

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:03.488
The unsteady hand betrays, huh?

01:19:05.658 --> 01:19:08.243
What's the matter, Mr Peabody?

01:19:10.163 --> 01:19:12.623
Are you afraid, huh?

01:19:14.876 --> 01:19:17.669
The answer is indubably

01:19:19.339 --> 01:19:20.464
yes.

01:19:27.347 --> 01:19:29.348
No courage left.

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:36.438
Well, courage can be
purchased at yon tavern.

01:19:38.191 --> 01:19:40.025
But have we credit?

01:19:41.069 --> 01:19:44.696
Huh? That is the question.
Have we credit?

01:19:46.032 --> 01:19:47.991
Well,

01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:50.369
credit is cheap.

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:58.460
Wait for me,
old servant of the public wheel.

01:20:01.047 --> 01:20:03.632
Our shining hour is yet to come.

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:16.103
As for you, Horace Greeley,

01:20:16.396 --> 01:20:21.858
go west, old man,
and grow young with the country.

01:20:38.418 --> 01:20:40.961
Don't do that, Mr Peabody.

01:20:41.087 --> 01:20:42.713
Why are you out here?

01:20:42.797 --> 01:20:46.508
Don't you know that everybody
has to get off the street?

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:50.178
My inalienable right,
the pursuit of happiness.

01:20:50.263 --> 01:20:54.766
Sure, but don't go to the saloon.
Liberty Valance is back there.

01:20:55.059 --> 01:20:58.520
You should hear
what he's swearing to do to Rance.

01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:01.148
And he ain't leaving you out, either.

01:21:01.232 --> 01:21:04.234
Go in and let the Mexican fill that.

01:21:04.318 --> 01:21:09.406
But I doubt if my credit is good with
these Spanish-American gentlemen.

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:10.741
Sure, it is.

01:21:10.825 --> 01:21:13.827
He's my wife's step-uncle
by her sister's marriage.

01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:17.122
But please say something nice
about me in your paper?

01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:19.958
My dear friend, Link Appleyard?

01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:23.336
The fearless,
fighting marshal of the west?

01:21:23.963 --> 01:21:27.966
Your name will go down
in history with Buffalo Bill!

01:21:38.936 --> 01:21:42.230
Mr Peabody's drunk as a skunk
over in that Mexican joint.

01:21:42.315 --> 01:21:45.358
- He ain't eating tonight.
- Hallie!

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:48.153
"Isn't" eating tonight, remember?

01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:51.782
Isn't, ain't,
what difference does it make?

01:21:51.866 --> 01:21:55.786
Ain't going to be school any more
with you leaving tonight.

01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:02.042
Good evening, folks.

01:22:02.126 --> 01:22:04.920
Mr Rance,
I have the buckboard out here.

01:22:05.004 --> 01:22:07.756
I'll be waiting for you, if you need me.

01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:12.511
Go, Rance. Go now, while you can.

01:22:13.012 --> 01:22:15.680
Nora and Hallie can finish the dishes.

01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:19.017
Ja, Rance.

01:22:19.602 --> 01:22:22.187
Go. Please go.

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:26.608
I owe you
for three days' room and board.

01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:30.737
I just want to square my account.

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:34.032
I want to square my account before I go.

01:22:52.552 --> 01:22:57.389
And those in England now asleep
shall think themselves accursed!

01:22:57.807 --> 01:23:00.809
They were not here whilst any lives

01:23:00.893 --> 01:23:05.021
that fought with us
on Saint Crispin's Day.

01:23:08.067 --> 01:23:11.528
But when the blast, the blast of war,

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:17.075
blows in our ears and we summon up...

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:22.414
Liberty Valance.

01:23:23.416 --> 01:23:25.208
And his Myrmidons!

01:23:32.592 --> 01:23:37.971
Liberty Valance taking liberties
with the liberty of the press?

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:40.640
Had your supper yet, Peabody?

01:23:40.725 --> 01:23:41.975
My supper?

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.853
No. That's a splendid idea!

01:23:58.075 --> 01:24:00.577
Well, you can start by eating this.

01:24:01.287 --> 01:24:04.122
- That's a poor joke, Liberty!
- Eat it!

01:24:04.457 --> 01:24:05.790
Eat it!

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:08.793
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:11.254
Eat it!

01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:52.462
He's dead!

01:26:24.472 --> 01:26:26.264
Mr Peabody?

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.937
Rance?

01:26:35.775 --> 01:26:37.650
Rance Stoddard?

01:26:56.504 --> 01:26:58.963
- Mr Peabody.
- Help me get him up.

01:27:04.762 --> 01:27:07.347
- Where's Doc Willoughby?
- In the saloon.

01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:08.973
Go and get him.

01:27:10.017 --> 01:27:11.309
Rance?

01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:13.770
Rance!

01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:26.658
I sure told that Liberty Valance

01:27:28.202 --> 01:27:33.957
about the freedom of the press.

01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:48.346
Marshal?

01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:12.162
Marshal...

01:28:15.374 --> 01:28:18.251
You tell Liberty Valance I'll be outside.

01:29:08.928 --> 01:29:10.929
- Pompey!
- Miss Hallie?

01:29:11.013 --> 01:29:13.348
- Where's Mr Tom?
- Down the road...

01:29:13.432 --> 01:29:15.808
Get him! Rance is out front with a gun!

01:29:15.893 --> 01:29:17.268
Yes, ma'am.

01:29:17.770 --> 01:29:21.189
You've heard of Gettysburg.
240 amputations...

01:29:21.273 --> 01:29:25.485
Doc, Mr Peabody's awful hurt.
He needs you at his office.

01:29:25.569 --> 01:29:28.029
Somebody have an accident?

01:29:30.241 --> 01:29:33.952
So that's it. Another one of
your accidents, huh, Valance?

01:29:34.745 --> 01:29:38.373
I'm waiting for the day
when they call me for you.

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:41.793
Paid in advance.

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:51.427
$10 into the cans.

01:29:52.471 --> 01:29:57.225
Liberty, what you did to Mr Peabody,
ain't that enough?

01:29:57.309 --> 01:29:59.561
Ain't that enough what, Mr Marshal?

01:29:59.645 --> 01:30:01.604
You know that Stoddard

01:30:01.689 --> 01:30:05.692
couldn't shoot the hat off his
own head with a gun in his hand.

01:30:06.527 --> 01:30:09.112
Oh, you mean,
he's got a gun in his hand, huh?

01:30:09.196 --> 01:30:12.991
I'm calling you, Valance.
Kings and threes.

01:30:14.326 --> 01:30:17.453
Good hand, but not good enough.

01:30:18.831 --> 01:30:21.583
Aces and eights. Thank you.

01:30:22.126 --> 01:30:25.670
If you gun him down,
it'll just be pure murder.

01:31:51.048 --> 01:31:53.800
Well, Mr Professor,
I thought you left town.

01:31:53.884 --> 01:31:56.010
What are you doing out here?

01:31:56.970 --> 01:31:59.263
I'm waiting for Liberty Valance.

01:31:59.807 --> 01:32:01.224
Why doesn't he come out?

01:32:01.308 --> 01:32:04.268
Well, that's none of our business.

01:32:07.398 --> 01:32:09.524
You heard him say he had a gun, right?

01:32:09.608 --> 01:32:12.110
- I didn't say that!
- That ain't murder.

01:32:12.194 --> 01:32:14.821
That's clean-cut self-defence.

01:32:15.322 --> 01:32:17.448
You heard him call me out, right?

01:32:17.616 --> 01:32:19.283
Well, didn't you?

01:32:20.619 --> 01:32:22.537
Now get out of my way.

01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:28.668
Hash slinger, are you out here?

01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:33.506
I'd say that
was Liberty Valance there now.

01:32:34.133 --> 01:32:35.633
Wouldn't you?

01:32:36.135 --> 01:32:39.804
- Yes, I would.
- We be seeing you, Mr Stoddard.

01:32:54.987 --> 01:32:57.196
Come closer where I can see you.

01:33:05.122 --> 01:33:07.165
Get out of that shadow, dude.

01:33:53.003 --> 01:33:56.172
You got two hands, hash slinger.
Pick it up!

01:34:22.533 --> 01:34:24.116
All right, dude,

01:34:25.828 --> 01:34:28.287
this time, right between the eyes.

01:34:44.638 --> 01:34:46.097
Liberty?

01:34:47.099 --> 01:34:49.350
Liberty? Liberty!

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.787
Hey, Doc! Doc!

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.374
Liberty!

01:35:51.455 --> 01:35:53.581
It's Liberty! He's hurt!

01:35:54.458 --> 01:35:56.000
It's Liberty!

01:36:00.005 --> 01:36:01.464
Whisky, quick.

01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:03.466
Here, sir.

01:36:16.521 --> 01:36:17.980
Dead.

01:37:10.784 --> 01:37:15.538
Rance, if it had been you
instead of Valance, I would...

01:37:15.622 --> 01:37:17.206
Oh, no, Hallie.

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:19.709
Hallie.

01:37:20.794 --> 01:37:22.420
I can't help it.

01:37:24.172 --> 01:37:25.965
This feels so guilty.

01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:32.096
I didn't... I didn't want you to run away.
I wanted you to stay.

01:37:32.389 --> 01:37:35.141
Oh, he might... I'm sorry.

01:37:36.184 --> 01:37:38.269
- Forgive me.
- Hallie...

01:37:39.813 --> 01:37:41.939
Hallie, please don't talk.

01:38:04.171 --> 01:38:06.839
I'm sorry I got here too late, Hallie.

01:38:08.216 --> 01:38:11.135
You got yourself
out of that fix real handy.

01:38:14.389 --> 01:38:16.182
I'll be around.

01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:54.303
- Tom! Tom, Liberty...
- I know.

01:39:09.194 --> 01:39:11.278
Liberty wasn't gonna kill him,
just nick him a little.

01:39:13.448 --> 01:39:16.951
Just gonna make a pass. You saw that!

01:39:17.577 --> 01:39:19.995
That lawyer shot him in cold blood!

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:24.375
- Now, that ain't the way we saw it.
- It was murder! Pure murder!

01:39:24.751 --> 01:39:28.129
And I say if the Marshal
don't put Stoddard in jail,

01:39:28.213 --> 01:39:30.840
we ought to take care of him ourselves!

01:39:30.924 --> 01:39:33.425
I say we ought to hang him!

01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:34.677
That's right! Hang him!

01:39:34.761 --> 01:39:36.971
Give him a rope necktie
and let him swing!

01:39:37.055 --> 01:39:40.724
Can't a man get a drink
around this town in peace?

01:39:47.399 --> 01:39:49.775
- No one's bothering you.
- You are!

01:39:55.615 --> 01:39:56.615
Marshal!

01:40:01.788 --> 01:40:04.540
What are you gettin' paid for?
Drag this scum out!

01:40:04.624 --> 01:40:09.378
Kaintuck and Highpockets,
I deputise you to give a hand.

01:40:09.462 --> 01:40:12.256
Hand me that... That's it.

01:40:16.344 --> 01:40:20.306
Tell those ranchers north
of the Picketwire that hired you

01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:24.351
that me, Link Appleyard,
run ya out of town,

01:40:24.436 --> 01:40:27.730
and I'll do it again
if you ever come back!

01:40:33.945 --> 01:40:36.113
Now, look, Pompey, you know I...

01:40:36.198 --> 01:40:37.948
Who says he can't?

01:40:38.867 --> 01:40:41.035
Pour yourself a drink, Pompey.

01:40:41.119 --> 01:40:44.830
- I don't drink no drams, Mr Tom.
- I said take a drink.

01:40:45.123 --> 01:40:48.709
No. We got a mare in foal
and horses to feed and water.

01:40:48.793 --> 01:40:50.419
Come on home.

01:40:51.379 --> 01:40:52.504
Home.

01:40:56.384 --> 01:40:58.135
Home sweet home.

01:40:58.511 --> 01:41:01.972
You're right, Pompey.
We got plenty to do at home.

01:41:04.059 --> 01:41:07.102
Well, what are they
paying you guys for? Play!

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.689
Be merry! Sing!

01:41:16.988 --> 01:41:18.781
Leave me be!

01:42:43.742 --> 01:42:45.242
Mr Tom!

01:43:16.649 --> 01:43:20.194
The horses, Pompey. The horses.

01:44:30.515 --> 01:44:33.684
- Hello, sir! How are you?
- Hey!

01:44:36.479 --> 01:44:39.314
Handy Strong! By golly, you made it!

01:44:39.399 --> 01:44:41.442
Yeah! Thanks to Doc Willoughby.

01:44:41.526 --> 01:44:43.652
Here. Let me pin this on you.

01:44:43.736 --> 01:44:46.113
Say, that's him, huh?

01:44:51.411 --> 01:44:55.539
- This must be Ransom Stoddard.
- Rance, this is Handy Strong.

01:44:55.623 --> 01:44:58.792
How do you do, sir?
It's quite a city here.

01:44:58.877 --> 01:45:01.462
It's not much by your eastern standards,

01:45:01.546 --> 01:45:05.382
but that railroad station there
leads straight to Washington.

01:45:09.179 --> 01:45:10.721
Come on, Rance.

01:45:26.362 --> 01:45:29.823
Order! Order! Order!

01:45:30.825 --> 01:45:32.117
Order!

01:45:33.077 --> 01:45:34.786
Order! Order!

01:45:35.205 --> 01:45:37.206
Order! Order!

01:45:38.541 --> 01:45:40.250
Order!

01:45:41.586 --> 01:45:43.587
Order! Quiet!

01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:47.424
Order! Quiet!

01:45:50.094 --> 01:45:53.222
The roll call having been completed

01:45:53.598 --> 01:45:57.017
and the delegates
recognised and seated,

01:45:57.894 --> 01:46:01.355
this session of the territorial convention

01:46:01.606 --> 01:46:04.441
is hereby declared open.

01:46:07.987 --> 01:46:09.321
Order!

01:46:11.115 --> 01:46:12.491
Order!

01:46:14.869 --> 01:46:16.328
Mr Chairman.

01:46:19.123 --> 01:46:21.583
The chair recognises

01:46:21.668 --> 01:46:25.504
the Honourable Major
Cassius Starbuckle,

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:29.633
soldier, jurist and statesman.

01:46:30.969 --> 01:46:35.430
Mr Chairman, fellow delegates,

01:46:35.807 --> 01:46:40.018
ladies and gentlemen,

01:46:42.146 --> 01:46:46.775
I came here
with a carefully prepared speech,

01:46:47.944 --> 01:46:51.738
but this is no time for oratory.

01:46:58.413 --> 01:47:02.874
Let me speak to you from the heart.

01:47:04.836 --> 01:47:08.755
I come before you
to place in nomination

01:47:09.424 --> 01:47:14.261
the name of a man
more qualified than any other

01:47:14.846 --> 01:47:18.098
to represent you in Washington.

01:47:18.725 --> 01:47:22.102
Oh, you ill-advised.

01:47:22.604 --> 01:47:25.731
Oh, you poorly counselled.

01:47:26.107 --> 01:47:30.444
Fly not in the face
of heaven's handiwork.

01:47:31.237 --> 01:47:34.823
Join with us in supportin' the man

01:47:35.199 --> 01:47:38.410
who for five terms in Congress

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:44.166
has kept this great territory inviolate.

01:47:45.209 --> 01:47:50.380
I nominate for the territorial delegate

01:47:50.965 --> 01:47:54.384
to the Congress of the United States

01:47:55.386 --> 01:48:01.183
the Right Honourable
Custis Buck Langhorne.

01:48:41.057 --> 01:48:45.018
Now that you got your rope on him,
hang the horse thief!

01:48:53.277 --> 01:48:55.153
Order! Order!

01:49:07.041 --> 01:49:10.168
Order! Order!

01:49:13.214 --> 01:49:15.048
Order! Order!

01:49:16.134 --> 01:49:19.344
This is a convention,
not a rodeo, Langhorne!

01:49:24.142 --> 01:49:26.309
Mr Chairman! Mr Chairman!

01:49:26.686 --> 01:49:30.647
The chair recognises its old friend,

01:49:31.441 --> 01:49:35.026
that distinguished member
of the fourth estate,

01:49:36.028 --> 01:49:40.115
founder, owner, publisher and editor

01:49:40.199 --> 01:49:42.242
of the Shinbone Star,

01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:47.164
Mr Dutton Peabody, Esquire.

01:49:51.586 --> 01:49:54.796
Thank you, Mr Chairman,
for those kind words,

01:49:54.881 --> 01:49:56.923
but tell them the whole truth.

01:49:57.008 --> 01:50:01.219
Founder, owner, editor
and I also sweep out the place.

01:50:04.182 --> 01:50:07.017
Fellow delegates, like all of you,

01:50:07.268 --> 01:50:12.773
I have listened in awe and admiration
to the magnificent oratory

01:50:13.024 --> 01:50:16.651
of the Honourable
Major Cassius Starbuckle,

01:50:16.736 --> 01:50:18.487
the cattlemen's mouthpiece.

01:50:18.571 --> 01:50:21.114
The lowing herd is still with us.

01:50:23.409 --> 01:50:27.204
But seriously,
under the spell of his eloquence,

01:50:27.288 --> 01:50:31.291
I could see once again
the vast herd of buffalo

01:50:31.375 --> 01:50:34.586
and savage redskin
roaming our beautiful territory

01:50:34.670 --> 01:50:38.298
with no law to trammel them
except the law of survival,

01:50:38.382 --> 01:50:41.218
the law of the tomahawk
and the bow and arrow.

01:50:41.511 --> 01:50:44.721
And then,
with the westward march of our nation,

01:50:45.097 --> 01:50:47.516
came the pioneer
and the buffalo hunter,

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:49.810
the adventurous and the bold,

01:50:49.894 --> 01:50:52.938
and the boldest of these
were the cattlemen

01:50:53.022 --> 01:50:57.317
who seized the wide-open range
for their own personal domain,

01:50:57.652 --> 01:51:01.613
and their law
was the law of the hired gun.

01:51:04.367 --> 01:51:09.204
But now, now,
today have come the railroads

01:51:09.497 --> 01:51:11.206
and the people.

01:51:11.666 --> 01:51:14.918
The steady, hard-working citizens,

01:51:15.419 --> 01:51:21.091
the homesteader, the shopkeeper,
the builder of cities.

01:51:22.301 --> 01:51:24.845
We need roads to join those cities,

01:51:24.929 --> 01:51:28.056
dams to store up
the waters of the Picketwire,

01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:31.309
and we need statehood
to protect the rights

01:51:31.394 --> 01:51:34.521
of every man and woman,
however humble.

01:51:36.691 --> 01:51:38.984
And how do we get it? I'll tell you how.

01:51:39.068 --> 01:51:42.112
We get it by placing our votes
behind one man.

01:51:42.572 --> 01:51:46.283
One man!
And we have that man with us here.

01:51:46.951 --> 01:51:51.413
He is a man who came to us
not packing a gun,

01:51:52.623 --> 01:51:57.544
but carrying instead a bag of law books.

01:51:57.962 --> 01:52:02.382
Yes. He is a lawyer and a teacher.

01:52:02.758 --> 01:52:05.302
The first west of the rosy buttes.

01:52:05.928 --> 01:52:08.889
But more important, he is a man

01:52:08.973 --> 01:52:12.183
who has come to be known
throughout this territory

01:52:12.268 --> 01:52:17.647
in the last few weeks as
a great champion of law and order.

01:52:18.649 --> 01:52:23.653
Ladies and gentlemen,
I nominate as your delegate and mine

01:52:24.697 --> 01:52:30.952
to the Congress at Washington,
the Honourable Ransom Stoddard!

01:52:48.179 --> 01:52:49.971
Let's have order!

01:52:51.974 --> 01:52:54.017
Get going, Starbuckle.

01:53:00.274 --> 01:53:02.484
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

01:53:03.444 --> 01:53:04.694
Thank you.

01:53:06.948 --> 01:53:07.948
Well...

01:53:08.908 --> 01:53:11.993
I see this demonstration,

01:53:12.119 --> 01:53:15.038
but I can't believe my eyes.

01:53:15.247 --> 01:53:19.292
Is it possible
that such a representative body

01:53:19.377 --> 01:53:24.589
of honest, hard-working Americans
can endorse a candidate

01:53:24.674 --> 01:53:27.467
for the Congress of our beloved country

01:53:27.551 --> 01:53:31.972
whose only claim to the office
is that he killed a man?

01:53:32.056 --> 01:53:34.557
Do you call Liberty Valance a man?

01:53:37.770 --> 01:53:40.188
Order! Order!

01:53:41.148 --> 01:53:42.691
Hear me out!

01:53:44.610 --> 01:53:48.113
Who is this Ransom Stoddard?

01:53:48.572 --> 01:53:50.865
And what qualifications has he

01:53:51.242 --> 01:53:55.954
that entitle him to aspire
to such great office?

01:53:56.455 --> 01:53:59.416
We are told he's a lawyer,

01:54:00.459 --> 01:54:02.585
an attorney-at-law,

01:54:03.838 --> 01:54:06.256
an officer of the court.

01:54:07.091 --> 01:54:10.635
Yes, but what kind of lawyer?

01:54:11.095 --> 01:54:16.182
A man who usurps the function
of both judge and jury

01:54:16.559 --> 01:54:20.020
and takes the law into his own hand.

01:54:28.195 --> 01:54:30.530
Quiet! Quiet!

01:54:33.409 --> 01:54:36.244
What other qualifications has he, then?

01:54:37.288 --> 01:54:39.622
The blood on his hands?

01:54:40.291 --> 01:54:43.126
The hidden gun beneath his coat?

01:54:43.878 --> 01:54:48.131
The bullet-riddled body
of an honest citizen?

01:54:48.215 --> 01:54:50.216
- Honest citizen?
- Liberty Valance?

01:54:50.301 --> 01:54:53.428
You call Liberty Valance
an honest citizen?

01:54:53.721 --> 01:54:57.974
Is this your fearless champion
of law and order?

01:54:58.059 --> 01:54:59.184
Mr Chairman!

01:54:59.268 --> 01:55:02.854
I tell you,
the mark of Cain is on this man,

01:55:03.606 --> 01:55:06.566
and the mark of Cain will be on all of us

01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:10.528
if we send him with bloodstained hands

01:55:10.613 --> 01:55:13.448
to walk
the hallowed halls of government

01:55:13.532 --> 01:55:16.201
- where Washington...
- Mr Chairman!

01:55:16.285 --> 01:55:17.660
Silence!

01:55:17.787 --> 01:55:20.246
- Mr Chairman!
- Order! Order!

01:55:20.498 --> 01:55:23.208
...yes, and Lincoln still live

01:55:23.709 --> 01:55:26.920
immortals in the memory of man.

01:55:27.004 --> 01:55:28.505
Mr Chairman!

01:55:38.265 --> 01:55:39.933
Rance! Rance!

01:55:40.267 --> 01:55:42.602
Order! Order!

01:55:47.691 --> 01:55:48.942
Pilgrim.

01:55:53.364 --> 01:55:55.156
Where are you going?

01:55:55.533 --> 01:55:57.367
I'm going home, Tom.

01:55:58.077 --> 01:56:00.578
I'm going back east where I belong.

01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:14.717
Valance couldn't make you run away.
What is it now, pilgrim?

01:56:15.219 --> 01:56:16.845
Your conscience?

01:56:17.596 --> 01:56:20.598
Isn't it enough to kill a man with...

01:56:21.308 --> 01:56:23.309
Without trying to build a life on it?

01:56:23.394 --> 01:56:26.980
You talk too much. Think too much.

01:56:27.731 --> 01:56:31.901
Besides, you didn't kill Liberty Valance.

01:56:36.407 --> 01:56:37.574
What?

01:56:37.658 --> 01:56:39.576
Think back, pilgrim.

01:56:43.789 --> 01:56:46.166
Valance came out of the saloon.

01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:50.253
You were walking toward him
when he fired his first shot.

01:56:51.088 --> 01:56:52.589
Remember?

01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:17.614
Pompey.

01:57:22.369 --> 01:57:24.454
All right, dude,

01:57:25.039 --> 01:57:28.541
this time, right between the eyes.

01:57:54.318 --> 01:57:55.485
But...

01:57:56.153 --> 01:57:58.571
But, Tom, why did you do it? Why...

01:57:58.656 --> 01:58:01.699
Cold-blooded murder,
but I can live with it.

01:58:02.326 --> 01:58:05.787
Hallie's happy. She wanted you alive.

01:58:05.871 --> 01:58:08.665
- But you saved my life!
- I wish I hadn't.

01:58:11.502 --> 01:58:13.419
Hallie's your girl now.

01:58:15.965 --> 01:58:18.883
Go on back in there
and take that nomination.

01:58:19.301 --> 01:58:21.761
You taught her how to read and write.

01:58:21.845 --> 01:58:24.889
Now give her something
to read and write about!

01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:04.012
Well, you know the rest of it.

01:59:05.889 --> 01:59:08.766
I went to Washington,
and we won statehood.

01:59:10.352 --> 01:59:12.103
I became the first governor.

01:59:12.896 --> 01:59:16.482
Three terms as governor,
two terms in the Senate,

01:59:17.901 --> 01:59:20.445
Ambassador to the Court of St James,

01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:24.699
back again to the Senate,

01:59:25.409 --> 01:59:28.411
and a man who,
with a snap of his fingers,

01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:32.999
could be the next vice-president
of the United States.

01:59:38.213 --> 01:59:40.673
You're not going to use the story,
Mr Scott?

01:59:41.759 --> 01:59:43.051
No, sir.

01:59:47.514 --> 01:59:49.307
This is the west, sir.

01:59:49.391 --> 01:59:52.518
When the legend becomes fact,
print the legend.

01:59:53.103 --> 01:59:54.771
He's right, Rance.

02:00:17.127 --> 02:00:19.170
It's getting late, Hallie.

02:00:23.759 --> 02:00:26.344
We'll keep in touch with you, Pompey.

02:00:27.221 --> 02:00:28.679
I promise.

02:00:29.181 --> 02:00:30.807
But, Mr Rance...

02:00:30.974 --> 02:00:32.600
Pork chop money.

02:00:52.121 --> 02:00:53.579
Hallie...

02:00:55.707 --> 02:00:58.334
Hallie, would you be too sorry

02:00:59.378 --> 02:01:02.672
if once I get the new
irrigation bill through...

02:01:04.883 --> 02:01:09.595
Would you be too sorry
if we just up and left Washington?

02:01:11.515 --> 02:01:12.557
I...

02:01:13.684 --> 02:01:18.563
I sort of have a hankering
to come back here to live.

02:01:20.023 --> 02:01:23.025
- Maybe open up a law office.
- Rance...

02:01:25.404 --> 02:01:28.156
If you knew how often I'd dreamed of it.

02:01:29.491 --> 02:01:31.159
My roots are here.

02:01:33.036 --> 02:01:35.037
I guess my heart is here.

02:01:36.707 --> 02:01:38.499
Yes, let's come back.

02:01:41.253 --> 02:01:44.380
Look at it. It was once a wilderness.

02:01:45.549 --> 02:01:47.216
Now it's a garden.

02:01:47.926 --> 02:01:49.552
Aren't you proud?

02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:58.186
Hallie, who put the cactus roses
on Tom's coffin?

02:02:00.272 --> 02:02:01.564
I did.

02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:12.408
Here, I got a brand-new spittoon,
cuspidor, Hallie.

02:02:12.784 --> 02:02:16.496
And the engineer's got a full
head of steam in this bucket.

02:02:16.914 --> 02:02:20.833
We'll make 25 miles an hour
or bust a boiler trying.

02:02:20.918 --> 02:02:24.378
And we wired ahead to Junction City.

02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:26.672
They'll hold the Express.

02:02:26.757 --> 02:02:29.967
In two days and nights,
you'll be back in Washington.

02:02:30.135 --> 02:02:31.844
Thank you, Jason.

02:02:31.929 --> 02:02:35.264
I'll write to the officials
of this railroad

02:02:35.349 --> 02:02:39.644
and thank them for their kindness
and for going to all this trouble.

02:02:40.062 --> 02:02:41.604
You think nothing of it.

02:02:41.730 --> 02:02:45.274
Nothing's too good for
the man who shot Liberty Valance.
