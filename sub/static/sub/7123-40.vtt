Loot, bro!

00:50.926 --> 00:52.098
Gear dumped, bro!

00:55.639 --> 00:57.892
How about this room, bro?

00:57.975 --> 00:59.272
Looks like a brolicious

00:59.351 --> 01:02.696
room to relax in and
play video games ...bro.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.525
Home sweet home, bro.

01:06.608 --> 01:07.825
Yeah, you said it.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.995
I've been home this whole time.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.411
I keep forgetting that
he lives here now.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.369
Just until Gunther finishes
rebuilding the Ice Kingdom.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.328
What y'all whispering about?

01:20.038 --> 01:22.291
Hee-hee! Ex-squeeze me.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.376
Ice King, we've told
you a thousand times.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.132
This couch ain't for cuddling.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.211
Sure it is.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.801
It isn't!

01:28.880 --> 01:30.132
Mm, it's cozy.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.467
It's not that bad, Jake.

01:31.550 --> 01:32.551
See?

01:33.969 --> 01:36.597
Finn, can I speak to
you in the kitchen?

01:39.224 --> 01:40.066
Oh, hey, Jake.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.610
Can you bring me a sandwich?

01:41.685 --> 01:43.733
Sandwich?

01:45.939 --> 01:47.907
It's time to kick Ice King out!

01:47.983 --> 01:49.075
Huh!

01:51.486 --> 01:52.658
Don't forget the bread!

01:52.738 --> 01:53.738
Ha ha!

01:54.948 --> 01:57.701
Look, I hear you, but we
can't kick him out because,

01:57.784 --> 02:00.333
well, I still feel guilty
about junking up his crib.

02:00.412 --> 02:03.291
Hey, what if we check
him into a hotel room?

02:03.373 --> 02:04.499
Hmm.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.096
What's that?

02:13.175 --> 02:14.677
Checking into a hotel room.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.971
Ooh, sandwich time!

02:21.516 --> 02:25.066
Hey, Simon, how would you like
to stay in the coolest hotel?

02:25.145 --> 02:27.068
Lumpy Space Princess
<i>stays</i> there.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.649
That's how cool it is.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.877
We'll even put you up for a few
weeks until your place is ready.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.824
Oh, but that sounds lonely.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.031
I'd just like to stay
here with you guys.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.706
Having roommates is nice.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.204
Keeps me out of my head.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.785
Gunther only <i>says</i> "Wenk."

02:39.868 --> 02:41.711
What's up with that?

02:42.871 --> 02:44.043
Yeah.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.172
Finn, I'm ready to
murder the Ice King.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.252
No.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.758
Uh, I have another idea.

03:00.847 --> 03:01.848
Oop.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.873
Oh, my gosh! Someone's
at the door.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.399
We have a doorbell now.
We'll get it!

03:14.778 --> 03:16.530
Abracadaniel?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.206
What are you doing here?

03:18.281 --> 03:19.203
What?

03:19.282 --> 03:20.499
You kept calling and ca...

03:21.868 --> 03:24.291
Shut the hupbububup, Abracadeez!

03:24.371 --> 03:25.497
Yeah, man.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.833
You don't even need a
reason to stop by.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.510
A sexy wizard like you
goes where he wants.

03:30.585 --> 03:31.962
Whoa.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.047
I see what's going on.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.553
Wha... you do?

03:35.632 --> 03:36.975
Yeah.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.054
This wizard donk is trying to
jack my tree house styles just

03:40.137 --> 03:42.031
'cause he beat me that one
time at wizard battle,

03:42.055 --> 03:43.432
and if he takes one step closer,

03:43.515 --> 03:45.768
I'll bust him up one real good!

03:45.851 --> 03:47.273
I never asked to be...

03:49.104 --> 03:50.651
Aah! Aah! Aaaaah!

03:50.731 --> 03:52.950
Come on, dude. We got
cookies and the cocoa.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.072
Dang, but you're
funny, Abracadaniel!

03:59.156 --> 04:00.624
I didn't say anything.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.831
Fantastic.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.207
Hey, Abadabs.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.287
Why don't you show us that
trick you're working on?

04:08.540 --> 04:09.540
Oh, uh...

04:09.583 --> 04:11.176
Yeah, I-I suppose I could.

04:11.251 --> 04:16.803
Shraa-molah-ra
cantata florianaaa.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.555
So good!

04:23.638 --> 04:24.480
Whoo!

04:24.556 --> 04:25.978
You're a good wizard!

04:26.057 --> 04:27.434
I don't know. It's dumb.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.359
I'm still working on it.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.652
It's... it's nothing.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.822
Oh, you're right
that ain't nothing!

04:31.897 --> 04:33.615
Check out this schwiza!

04:37.861 --> 04:38.987
Hwah!

04:41.198 --> 04:42.040
What?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.708
Oo-oh!

04:43.784 --> 04:47.755
You're the greatest wizard ever!

04:47.829 --> 04:49.877
Well, maybe not ever ever.

04:49.956 --> 04:53.256
Am I the greatest wizard
of our generation?

04:53.335 --> 04:54.587
Yes.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.436
Pew! Pew!

05:31.998 --> 05:33.591
This was a great idea, man.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.214
It's like he's forgotten
all about us.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.795
Mm-hmm.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.397
And pretty soon he'll be
out of here for good.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.843
<i>For good.</i>

05:39.923 --> 05:42.517
Yeah. Mm.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.265
Finn!

05:44.344 --> 05:45.561
Jake!

05:46.888 --> 05:47.684
Come quick!

05:47.764 --> 05:48.640
It's an emergency!

05:48.723 --> 05:50.145
Hurry!

05:53.478 --> 05:55.321
Ice King, what's up?

05:55.397 --> 05:57.525
Huh? What the flip?

05:57.607 --> 05:59.530
Ta-da!

05:59.609 --> 06:01.361
How'd they get the
other couch down here?

06:01.444 --> 06:02.444
There you are, sir.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.989
And there you are.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.453
Right this way.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.334
You made it!

06:20.046 --> 06:21.719
Caw!

06:21.798 --> 06:22.970
Ta-da!

06:24.217 --> 06:26.891
A bird! He's a bird!

06:26.970 --> 06:28.813
I've always been into
interpretive dance...

06:31.182 --> 06:33.856
but I've never been able to find
a musician who could match my

06:33.935 --> 06:36.905
energy until now!

06:48.325 --> 06:50.544
Huh, he's actually not bad.

and I got to...

07:29.866 --> 07:31.334
Got some stuff to take care of.

07:31.409 --> 07:34.162
Yeah, it's getting pretty late.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.007
Uh... oh, glob.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.335
Sup, ABD?

07:39.417 --> 07:43.388
I just remembered that I'm,
uh, allergic, uh, to...

07:43.463 --> 07:44.965
To the night sky!

07:45.048 --> 07:46.345
You're afraid of the dark?

07:46.424 --> 07:49.678
Yes, if I ever had to walk,
uh, outside at night,

07:49.761 --> 07:52.389
I might die of ...of...

07:52.472 --> 07:55.521
of fright.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.318
Of fright!

07:58.853 --> 08:01.276
Gee, well, I guess you can
crash here for the night.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.573
All right!

08:02.649 --> 08:03.992
Sleepover!

08:04.067 --> 08:05.239
Wait.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.616
Are you really
afraid of the dark?

08:07.696 --> 08:09.289
Maybe?

08:09.364 --> 08:11.162
Okay, well, you can
sleep on the couch.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.709
We're gonna go.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.206
Uh, good night.

08:22.627 --> 08:23.627
Whoa!

08:23.670 --> 08:24.592
See?

08:24.671 --> 08:26.139
I told you. Isn't it awesome?

08:26.214 --> 08:27.682
Since I'm pretty
much in charge here,

08:27.757 --> 08:30.135
we could totally take all this
treasure if we wanted to.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.640
Ha! Totally.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.105
Wow! Cool!

08:35.265 --> 08:37.267
Oh, that's just a binklemyer.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.192
Oh.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.566
Want to see something
really cool?

08:40.645 --> 08:41.897
Yeah.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.779
Okay, but you got to
promise not to freak out.

08:47.277 --> 08:50.747
This is Joshua the dog's
demon-blood sword.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.417
Yeah, it's a real
demon-blood sword.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.960
Whaaaaaaat?

08:57.787 --> 08:59.710
And you see these words?

08:59.789 --> 09:03.544
If you say them out loud, you
can actually see a vision

09:03.626 --> 09:07.301
of the demon whose blood was
used to make the sword.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.973
No way!

09:10.050 --> 09:12.052
That sounds awesome.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.854
Too bad neither of us
can read demon runes.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.476
Ooh, I know how!

09:16.556 --> 09:19.480
"Booty rum lac soo ree
po Kee Oth prandium."

09:19.559 --> 09:20.559
Like that.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.228
Oops.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.399
Wow! It looks so real!

09:25.482 --> 09:26.950
I am real!

09:27.025 --> 09:28.402
Aaaaaaaaaah!

09:30.612 --> 09:33.365
Bring me the true bearer of my
blood sword or I will destroy

09:33.448 --> 09:34.620
You both!

09:37.077 --> 09:38.374
Come on, best friend!

09:38.453 --> 09:40.046
Let us not betray Finn.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.590
Let's fight Kee Oth ourselves!

09:42.665 --> 09:45.635
Nobody can defeat us
if we work together.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.337
Super wizard team up!

09:47.420 --> 09:48.637
Hwah!

09:48.713 --> 09:49.509
Floriana!

09:49.589 --> 09:50.590
Raaa!

09:50.673 --> 09:52.801
You're wasting
your powers on me!

09:52.884 --> 09:54.101
Ha ha!

09:54.177 --> 09:55.019
Oh! No!

09:55.095 --> 09:55.937
Oh, no!

09:56.012 --> 09:57.138
He's too powerful!

10:00.809 --> 10:01.901
Kee Oth!

10:01.976 --> 10:03.649
Joshua!

10:03.728 --> 10:04.900
Kee Oth rama pan...

10:04.979 --> 10:05.998
Don't say another word, Joshua.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.462
Or their throats are
going to get it!

10:07.524 --> 10:09.242
If you speak the
words to banish me,

10:09.317 --> 10:12.366
I'll reduce your friends to ash.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.241
Kee Oth rama...

10:13.321 --> 10:14.573
Dude!

10:14.656 --> 10:15.657
Thought he was bluffing.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.208
I'm not bluffing, Joshua!

10:17.283 --> 10:19.377
If you do not willingly
return my stolen blood,

10:19.452 --> 10:21.796
I will destroy him and him!

10:23.248 --> 10:24.545
Ah! The sword!

10:24.624 --> 10:26.001
Scary!

10:27.460 --> 10:29.303
I just can't do it, Jake.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.676
This is Dad's sword!

10:30.755 --> 10:32.553
You don't have any other choice.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.633
Do it!

10:33.716 --> 10:36.014
Do it! Do it!

10:38.972 --> 10:40.599
Whoa, bro.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.281
You got your blood.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.404
Now get out of here!

10:50.483 --> 10:52.281
All right, I'll go.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.236
Psych!

10:53.319 --> 10:54.741
Got you now, Joshua!

10:54.821 --> 10:56.164
Ah!

11:00.618 --> 11:01.744
Uh, hey.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.171
So, I-I should be getting home.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.246
Uh, yeah. Me too.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.462
Hey, Abracadaniel, you want
to hang out at my place?

11:06.541 --> 11:08.043
I thought your house broke.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.173
Psh.

11:09.252 --> 11:10.879
