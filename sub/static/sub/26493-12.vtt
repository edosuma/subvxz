00:01.910 --> 00:05.323
MOM, LOOK AT ME.
I AM GAY.

00:05.330 --> 00:06.331

NO AMOUNT OF PRAYER

00:06.340 --> 00:07.375
THAT'S GONNA
CHANGE THAT.

00:07.380 --> 00:09.087
MRS. COOPER:
I LOVE YOU, TAMIA.

00:09.090 --> 00:10.501
YOUR FATHER AND I WORKED

00:10.510 --> 00:13.252
BUT I'M SORRY, I--I

00:13.260 --> 00:14.637
OLIVIA: 1 JUST WENT
DOWN A BAD PATH

00:14.640 --> 00:16.290
AND TRIED TO DROWN IT

00:16.300 --> 00:19.804
PARENTS FREAKED,
AND HERE I AM.

00:19.810 --> 00:22.472
YOU ALSO HAVE A DAUGHTER

00:22.480 --> 00:23.970
AND THE ONE PERSON
YOU'RE FOCUSED ON,

00:23.980 --> 00:26.472
THE ONE PERSON YOU'RE
TRYING TO SAVE, IS SPENCER.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.938
JORDAN: WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
COME UP WITH A WHOLE NEW PLAYBOOK,

00:28.940 --> 00:30.476
SINCE SOMEONE GAVE
MALIBU OURS.

00:30.480 --> 00:31.936
MY LIFE WAS
FALLING APART,

AND IN A MOMENT
OF WEAKNESS--

00:33.320 --> 00:34.731
ANOTHER MOMENT

00:34.740 --> 00:36.481
HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU
GONNA USE THAT

00:36.490 --> 00:39.369
SORRY-ASS EXCUSE

00:59.100 --> 01:00.499
SPENCER: ATOMS

10:12.320 --> 10:16.029
BEFORE IT'S EVEN GOTTEN
STARTED, THAT'S ALL.

10:16.030 --> 10:17.850
THEN DON'T LET IT.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.287

10:36.260 --> 10:37.750
<i>1 CAN KEEP HER NAME

11:06.660 --> 11:08.037
YOU'RE SUPPOSED

11:08.040 --> 11:09.326

YOU'RE TRYING

11:18.630 --> 11:20.871

11:20.880 --> 11:22.757
EITHER WE HAVE THIS

11:22.760 --> 11:25.001
OR WE AIN'T HAVING NO
MORE CONVERSATIONS.

11:46.620 --> 11:48.531
SO, WHERE'S
YOUR ROOMMATE?

11:48.540 --> 11:51.032
ASHER IS PROBABLY

12:00.170 --> 12:03.800
SO, I'M SORRY
I'VE BEEN A LITTLE

12:03.800 --> 12:05.461
DISTRACTED LATELY.

12:05.470 --> 12:07.131
I ACTUALLY
THINK "DISTANT"

12:07.140 --> 12:08.551

LOOKING FOR.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.551
OUCH. OK.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.477

WE'VE REALLY HAD

12:23.740 --> 12:25.060
NO ALONE TIME.

12:25.070 --> 12:27.198
OR SPACE TO JUST
FOCUS ON US.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.328
AND I WANT
TO CHANGE THAT.

12:29.330 --> 12:30.365

12:38.460 --> 12:39.837

PLANNING A SPECIAL DAY

14:13.720 --> 14:15.302

14:15.310 --> 14:16.721

15:22.380 --> 15:23.870
I DID KIND OF HOPE

15:23.880 --> 15:25.837
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

15:25.840 --> 15:28.252
I DIDN'T AGREE WITH
WHAT YOUR MOM DID, BUT

15:28.260 --> 15:29.659
AS SHE HAPPILY
POINTED OUT,

15:29.670 --> 15:30.831
I'M NOT THE ONE
ON THE GROUND

15:30.840 --> 15:33.423
RAISING YOU

15:33.430 --> 15:35.888
BUT I'M HERE NOW.

15:35.890 --> 15:37.767

15:52.030 --> 15:53.691
OR DO YOU AND MA

15:53.700 --> 15:57.443
NO, WE WANT YOU

15:57.450 --> 15:59.862
HAVE YOU NOT MET
YOUR WIFE, DAD?

15:59.870 --> 16:03.329
YOU AIN'T GONNA BELIEVE
THIS, BUT YOUR MOM,

16:03.330 --> 16:05.037
SHE HAD A CHANGE
OF HEART.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.667
SHE MISSES YOU,

16:06.670 --> 16:08.377
AND SHE'S READY
TO ACCEPT YOU.

16:08.380 --> 16:09.916
ALL OF YOU.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.627

SAME JANELLE COOPER?

16:11.630 --> 16:14.429

16:40.910 --> 16:42.787
YEAH. UH,

16:42.790 --> 16:45.578
IT'S OK.
UM, I ACTUALLY

16:45.580 --> 16:48.242
HAVE SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.491
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVED THE REMAKE.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.502
I WAS GONNA WAIT
TILL TOMORROW, BUT

16:52.510 --> 16:53.966
IT'S TO CELEBRATE
YOUR COURAGE.

16:53.970 --> 16:56.257
-LEILA--
-NO. LET ME FINISH.

16:56.260 --> 17:00.925
TOMORROW IS YOUR
ONE-YEAR SOBRIETY MARK.

17:00.930 --> 17:03.979
OF COURSE I REMEMBER.
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU

17:03.980 --> 17:05.128
AND HOW HARD YOU FOUGHT

17:05.140 --> 17:08.359
TO GET YOUR LIFE
AND ALL THAT--

17:10.730 --> 17:13.438
MAN: MOMENTS PALE

17:13.440 --> 17:15.192
I FOUND THEM
THIS MORNING.

17:16.859 --> 17:18.612
HAVE YOU TAKEN ANY?

17:18.619 --> 17:21.407
NO. NOT YET.

17:21.410 --> 17:26.780
BUT IT'S BEEN, UM...
IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD.

17:26.790 --> 17:28.622
YOU KNOW, EVERY DAY

17:28.630 --> 17:32.373
I MAKE AN ACTIVE CHOICE
TO STAY SOBER.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.870
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

17:33.880 --> 17:38.829
AND TODAY, IT'S...
IT'S JUST NOT WORKING.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.424
LIV, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS ALONE.

17:42.430 --> 17:45.058
I AM HERE FOR YOU.

17:45.060 --> 17:46.550
YEAH. YEAH.

17:46.560 --> 17:50.349
I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME
FOR MY FAMILY, YOU KNOW?

17:50.360 --> 17:52.852
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO EVEN REMEMBERED

17:52.860 --> 17:54.680
IT WAS MY ONE-YEAR
SOBRIETY COMING UP.

17:54.690 --> 17:55.896
I'M SURE
THEY REMEMBERED.

17:55.900 --> 18:00.110
NO. BUT I--I GET IT.
LIKE, THEY'RE BUSY.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.020
AND THIS TIME
OF YEAR'S ALWAYS BAD

18:02.030 --> 18:03.828
BECAUSE OF
PLAYOFFS AND...

18:03.830 --> 18:05.958
MY MOM HAS HER
D.A. CAMPAIGNS.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.496
YOU NEED TO TELL
YOUR PARENTS AND JORDAN

18:07.500 --> 18:08.706
HOW YOU'RE
REALLY FEELING.

18:08.710 --> 18:09.950
NO, IT'LL JUST
HURT THEM.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.031
IT'S HURTING YOU.

18:12.040 --> 18:15.260
THEY CAN'T FIX IT
UNLESS THEY KNOW.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.718
AND YOU CAN'T HEAL
UNLESS YOU'RE

18:17.720 --> 18:20.758
HONEST WITH THEM.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.969
NO MORE STRUGGLING
IN SILENCE.

18:29.810 --> 18:31.687
AHEM.

18:31.690 --> 18:33.351
HEY, BABY.
YOU CLOSE?

18:33.360 --> 18:34.350
ABOUT TONIGHT.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.896
NO. COME ON.
DON'T SAY.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.140
I'M SO SORRY.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.152
LET ME GUESS.
WHAT DOES ASHER NEED NOW?

18:39.160 --> 18:42.027
SERIOUSLY?
I RAN INTO OLIVIA,

18:42.030 --> 18:43.020
AND SHE'S HAVING
A ROUGH TIME,

18:43.030 --> 18:45.078
SO, I'M STAYING
WITH HER.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.707
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
ALL RIGHT?

18:48.710 --> 18:49.916
OF COURSE.
IT'S COOL.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.376
NO, I HAVE
TO GO.

19:11.940 --> 19:15.012
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

19:15.020 --> 19:17.182
I HAVE A FEW WORDS
FOR YOU.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.397
SUSPENDED FROM
SCHOOL? SERIOUSLY?

19:19.400 --> 19:21.027
LOOK, MA, IT WASN'T
MY FAULT, ALL RIGHT?

19:21.030 --> 19:22.941
LAST YEAR IT WAS
CUTTING CLASS.

19:22.950 --> 19:24.770
THIS YEAR IT'S
ALL THESE FIGHTS.

19:24.780 --> 19:26.578
IT'S DAMN WELL
YOUR FAULT.

19:26.580 --> 19:28.070
YOU CONTROL
YOUR ACTIONS.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.491
NO MATTER WHO SAYS
OR DOES WHAT,

19:29.500 --> 19:33.164
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

19:33.170 --> 19:35.958
THIS CANNOT
KEEP HAPPENING.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.758
-YEAH.
-EXCUSE ME?

19:37.760 --> 19:39.000
COME HERE.

19:39.010 --> 19:41.001
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAY?

19:41.010 --> 19:43.889
EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE
IS A FIGHT, MA.

19:43.890 --> 19:45.346
AND IT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF ONE GUY

19:45.350 --> 19:47.136
WHO NEVER CARED ENOUGH
TO STAY WITH HIS FAMILY.

19:47.140 --> 19:49.177
I GET THAT YOU'RE ANGRY
THAT YOUR FATHER LEFT,

19:49.180 --> 19:50.807
BUT THAT DOES NOT
MEAN YOU GET TO

19:50.810 --> 19:51.971
THROW AWAY
YOUR FUTURE.

19:51.980 --> 19:54.017
YOU THINK I LIKE
BEING MAD ALL THE TIME?

19:57.070 --> 19:58.777
AIN'T NOTHING I CAN
DO ABOUT IT NOW.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.771
-WAIT, BABY.
-NO, MA!

20:00.780 --> 20:02.942
YOU CAN'T FIX THIS!

20:05.030 --> 20:07.158
THIS IS IT.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.743
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
SPENCER.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.956
NO. I GIVE UP.

20:20.050 --> 20:23.179
THANK YOU.
GRACIE.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.842
I NEED YOUR HELP.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.842
OK.

20:39.730 --> 20:42.313
THAT'S FUNNY. HE DON'T
LOOK LIKE OLIVIA TO ME.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.277
LEILA: EXCUSE ME? ASHER:
DUDE, IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.657
I DON'T REMEMBER
ASKING YOU, DAWG.

20:45.660 --> 20:47.446
LEILA: HEY, SPENCER.

20:47.450 --> 20:49.612
HERE, SO YOU CAN
GET IN THE HOUSE.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.113
WAY TO GO.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.918
HE LOCKED HIMSELF
OUT, FYI.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.627
HEY, JEALOUSY IS NOT
A GOOD LOOK ON YOU.

20:57.630 --> 20:58.665
YEAH, MY GIRL
LYING TO ME

20:58.670 --> 20:59.956
AIN'T A GOOD LOOK,
EITHER.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.041
I HAVE NEVER
LIED TO YOU.

21:01.050 --> 21:03.166
I WOULD NEVER
DO THAT.

21:03.170 --> 21:04.331
AND THE FACT
THAT YOU ASSUME

21:04.340 --> 21:06.422
INSTEAD OF ASKING ME
WHAT HAPPENED HURTS.

21:06.430 --> 21:09.218
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO THINK? HUH?

21:09.220 --> 21:10.847
YOU MOVED HOMEBOY
INTO YOUR HOUSE.

21:10.850 --> 21:12.136
FIRST QUALITY TIME
WAS THE ISSUE.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.596
NOW IT'S ASHER
LIVING WITH ME.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.056
WHICH ONE IS IT,
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE

21:15.060 --> 21:17.051
YOU'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR PROBLEMS.

21:17.060 --> 21:18.767
AND NO,
FOR THE RECORD,

21:18.770 --> 21:20.568
I ASKED YOU, LIKE,
100 TIMES

21:20.570 --> 21:23.278
IF YOU WERE OK WITH
ASHER MOVING IN WITH ME,

21:23.280 --> 21:24.736
AND INSTEAD OF YOU
TELLING ME THE TRUTH,

21:24.740 --> 21:25.810
YOU LIED TO ME.

21:25.820 --> 21:26.901
COME ON.
OPEN YOUR EYES.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.025
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

21:28.030 --> 21:31.284
I EXPECTED YOU
TO TRUST ME.

21:31.290 --> 21:35.454
-LOOK, I DO TRUST YOU.
-NO, YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.246
YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THOSE
WORDS WHEN YOU SAY THEM,

21:37.250 --> 21:39.378
BUT THE TRUTH IS
YOU DON'T.

21:39.380 --> 21:40.950
AND WHAT HURTS IS
I HAVE NEVER GIVEN YOU

21:40.960 --> 21:41.950
A REASON NOT TO.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.088
LEILA. I--

21:44.090 --> 21:47.128
GRACE: IT'S SPENCER.
HE'S BEEN

21:47.130 --> 21:50.885
GETTING INTO A LOT OF
TROUBLE AT SCHOOL LATELY.

21:50.890 --> 21:52.346
IN AND OUT
OF FIGHTS.

21:52.350 --> 21:54.591
HE WAS JUST
SUSPENDED AGAIN.

21:58.020 --> 22:00.853
YOU'RE A COACH
AT BEVERLY.

22:00.860 --> 22:03.477
I THINK A CHANGE
OF ENVIRONMENT,

22:03.480 --> 22:05.062
GOING TO A SCHOOL
THAT CAN OFFER HIM

22:05.070 --> 22:07.107
MORE THAN
JUST FOOTBALL,

22:07.110 --> 22:09.192
A SCHOOL THAT DOESN'T
REMIND HIM OF COREY

22:09.200 --> 22:11.271
EVERY SINGLE DAY

22:11.280 --> 22:13.157
MAY BE THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE HIM.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.195
JUST COME
WATCH HIM PLAY

22:14.200 --> 22:15.747
ONCE HE'S BACK
IN SCHOOL.

22:15.750 --> 22:18.208
GRACE: MAYBE THAT'LL--
BILLY: THERE ARE RULES.

22:18.210 --> 22:20.076
THERE ARE RULES
AND--AND I,

22:20.080 --> 22:22.879
I'M JUST NOT
IN THE POSITION TO--

22:22.880 --> 22:24.257
TO BEND THEM.

22:26.220 --> 22:27.585
WHAT?

22:29.430 --> 22:31.421
IT TOOK A LOT FOR ME
TO CALL YOU,

22:31.430 --> 22:33.558
AND I KNOW THAT YOU
HAVE YOUR OWN FAMILY

22:33.560 --> 22:35.972
AND YOUR OWN PROBLEMS
TO WORRY ABOUT,

22:35.980 --> 22:38.096
BUT WE OWE SPENCER

22:55.240 --> 22:58.323

23:08.220 --> 23:10.291
HOW MANY FINGERS

23:12.300 --> 23:14.041

OLIVIA: HE DIDN'T EVEN
WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE OVER

24:02.480 --> 24:06.189
AND SOMEHOW, HE'S STILL
THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.

24:06.190 --> 24:08.352
YOU'RE NOT GONNA RUN OVER
AND KISS THE RING

24:08.360 --> 24:10.397
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE?

24:10.400 --> 24:11.856
NAH.

24:30.460 --> 24:33.464
I'M SORRY.

25:03.250 --> 25:05.571
WITH WHATEVER ELSE
YOU'RE ON?

25:05.580 --> 25:08.163
OHH.

25:08.170 --> 25:10.298
YOU WORRIED

25:14.760 --> 25:19.960
WOMAN: DRIPS ON YOUR LIPS,
ON YOUR SHOULDERS

25:19.970 --> 25:23.224
WHEN YOU FOLLOW
THE CURVE OF MY BODY

25:23.230 --> 25:24.971
I FORGET TO BREATHE

25:24.980 --> 25:27.893
WHEN YOU MOVE ME

25:27.900 --> 25:30.437
-HEY, MAYBE WE--
-WHY ARE YOU STILL TALKING?

25:30.440 --> 25:34.354
WOMAN: IF YOU KNEW ME, YOU'D
KNOW THAT I CAN KEEP GOING

25:34.360 --> 25:36.351
I CAN KEEP GOING

25:36.360 --> 25:42.322
YOU AIN'T NEVER MET SOMEONE
LIKE ME BEFORE

25:42.330 --> 25:47.996
AND YOU AIN'T NEVER SEEN
SOMEBODY DO WHAT I CAN DO

25:48.000 --> 25:51.789

25:58.470 --> 26:00.882
BILLY: JORDAN.
LAURA: WHAT'S GOING ON, HONEY?

26:05.480 --> 26:07.346
DO YOU KNOW HOW SAD IT IS

26:07.350 --> 26:09.512
THAT I HAVE TO SEND 911 TEXTS

26:09.520 --> 26:12.148
JUST TO GET YOU ALL HERE
TO TALK TO ME?

26:12.150 --> 26:13.185
OK, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

26:13.190 --> 26:15.181
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FACT

26:15.190 --> 26:16.351
THAT I FEEL INVISIBLE

26:16.360 --> 26:18.408
IN MY OWN FAMILY.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.823
LAURA: OLIVIA...
OLIVIA: JUST LET ME FINISH.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.538
AHEM.

26:24.540 --> 26:28.363
YOU GUYS ARE ALL
SO GOAL-ORIENTED.

26:28.370 --> 26:30.122
YOU LIVE
IN THE FUTURE,

26:30.130 --> 26:32.337
ALWAYS FOCUSED
ON THE NEXT GAME,

26:32.340 --> 26:33.455
THE NEXT WIN,
THE NEXT CAMPAIGN.

26:33.460 --> 26:35.667
IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T
SEE THE DETAILS

26:35.670 --> 26:38.048
IN THE PRESENT.

26:38.050 --> 26:40.132
EXCEPT I LIVE IN THE PRESENT.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.539
BABY GIRL, OBVIOUSLY,
WE SEE YOU.

26:41.550 --> 26:44.303
DO YOU?
I MEAN, WHY DO YOU THINK

26:44.310 --> 26:47.473
I STARTED USING DRUGS
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

26:47.480 --> 26:49.471
BEING THE PARTY GIRL
AT LEAST GAVE ME SOMETHING,

26:49.480 --> 26:51.391
AND THEN STILL,
YOU DIDN'T NOTICE

26:51.400 --> 26:53.767
UNTIL I ALMOST O.D.'D.

26:53.770 --> 26:56.319
AND THEN YOU JUST
THREW MONEY AT THE PROBLEM.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.448
SHIPPED ME OFF
TO REHAB, AND POOF,

26:58.450 --> 26:59.394
I WAS MAGICALLY FIXED.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.152
IT WAS NOT
A MAGICAL FIX.

27:01.160 --> 27:02.446
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT.

27:02.450 --> 27:04.691
HONEY, IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S WHAT YOU NEEDED.

27:04.700 --> 27:09.456
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT
ALL THAT I NEEDED.

27:09.460 --> 27:13.340
POST-REHAB, SPENCER
IS THE ONLY PERSON

27:13.340 --> 27:16.799
WHO ASKED IF
I'M REALLY OK.

27:16.800 --> 27:21.545
ALL OF YOU JUST ASSUMED I WAS
AND MOVED ON.

27:21.550 --> 27:23.382
WE'RE SO, SO, SORRY,

27:23.390 --> 27:27.054
BUT YOU'VE
BEEN SO STRONG.

27:27.060 --> 27:29.131
YOU'RE RIGHT.

27:29.140 --> 27:31.131
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
PAYING CLOSER ATTENTION.

27:31.140 --> 27:35.600
I JUST DON'T WANT US
TO KEEP MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.476
I MEAN, LOOK WHAT
HAPPENED WITH JORDAN.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.527
JORDAN: LIV...
OLIVIA: HE SMOKED WEED,

27:38.530 --> 27:40.066
STAYED OUT
ALL NIGHT,

27:40.070 --> 27:41.447
AND THERE WAS NO
CONSEQUENCE FROM YOU GUYS.

27:41.450 --> 27:42.656
ALL YOU CARED ABOUT
WAS IF HE WAS

27:42.660 --> 27:44.571
READY FOR
THE BIG GAME OR NOT.

27:44.580 --> 27:48.699
BILLY: RIGHT. UM--
LAURA: I'M SORRY. WHAT?

27:48.700 --> 27:51.328
WHAT IS SHE TALKING

27:51.330 --> 27:52.491
I'M SORRY.
I--1--

27:52.500 --> 27:53.911
I THOUGHT
SHE KNEW.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.457
NO. I DON'T KNOW.

27:56.460 --> 28:00.419
SO, SOMEBODY BETTER
START TALKING. NOW.

28:07.810 --> 28:08.379
AHH.

28:08.390 --> 28:09.380
THANKS FOR
COMING WITH ME

28:09.390 --> 28:10.471

28:10.480 --> 28:12.517
FOR SURE. WHERE ELSE WOULD I BE?

28:12.520 --> 28:13.976
I DON'T KNOW.
PROBABLY SOMEWHERE

28:13.980 --> 28:17.518
PICKING UP THE SHATTERED
PIECES OF YOUR LOVE LIFE.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.897
TRIED TO CALL
OLD GIRL YET?

28:18.900 --> 28:20.527

28:20.530 --> 28:22.237
SO, MAKE HER

28:22.240 --> 28:23.696
FIGHT FOR
YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.361

KIA ALL OVER AGAIN.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.519
KIA BROKE UP WITH
ME BECAUSE I WAS--

28:26.530 --> 28:29.363

YOU DIDN'T TRUST HER.

28:29.370 --> 28:31.407
AND NOW IT'S HAPPENING
AGAIN WITH LEILA.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.617

28:33.620 --> 28:34.416
SO, WHAT,

28:34.420 --> 28:35.706
NO, I AIN'T
NO PSYCHIC,

28:35.710 --> 28:37.200
AND I AIN'T GOTTA BE
TO FIGURE OUT

28:37.210 --> 28:39.167

28:58.860 --> 29:00.646
HOW COME I AIN'T NEVER TRY

29:33.680 --> 29:36.809
FOR NOT RATTING
YOU OUT.

29:36.810 --> 29:39.893
LOOK, LIV, I KNEW YOU
WERE USING, OK, A LOT,

29:39.900 --> 29:43.313
AND I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.607
I GUESS I THOUGHT
I WAS BEING

29:45.610 --> 29:47.521
A GOOD BROTHER
BY COVERING FOR YOU.

29:47.530 --> 29:49.157
MAYBE IF I WOULD'VE SAID
SOMETHING SOONER,

29:49.160 --> 29:50.446
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE...

29:50.450 --> 29:52.236
YOU'D PROBABLY STILL
HAVE FOUND ME

29:52.240 --> 29:53.537
PASSED OUT
AFTER THE PARTY.

29:53.540 --> 29:56.578
I WAS SO FAR GONE.

29:56.580 --> 29:58.662
YOU SCARED ME TO
DEATH THAT DAY, LIV.

29:58.670 --> 30:01.583
OK, AND MAYBE
THAT'S WHY

30:01.590 --> 30:03.752
I TRIED TO FORGET
IT EVER HAPPENED,

30:03.760 --> 30:05.410
BUT IT DID.

30:05.420 --> 30:07.582
AND NONE OF US
SHOULD FORGET THAT.

30:20.020 --> 30:23.524
CONGRATULATIONS FOR MAKING
IT ONE YEAR SOBER, BY THE WAY.

30:24.650 --> 30:28.905
YOU DID...YOU DID
MAKE IT, RIGHT?

30:28.910 --> 30:30.446
HA HA!

30:32.990 --> 30:34.651
YOU BUSY TONIGHT?

30:36.460 --> 30:38.030
NOT ANYMORE.

30:41.750 --> 30:43.661
SERIOUS.
SHE DIDN'T CARE

30:43.670 --> 30:45.547
IF SHE SPLIT HER PANTS
DOWN THE MIDDLE.

30:45.550 --> 30:47.416
TAMIA--
SHE JUST KEPT DANCING.

30:47.420 --> 30:48.717
SPENCER: OH.
I REMEMBER THAT.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.210
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR
TRYING TO DO THE SPLIT.

30:50.220 --> 30:51.676
HEY, MAN, LISTEN.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.808
US COOPERS TAKE OUR
DANCE-OFFS VERY SERIOUSLY.

30:53.810 --> 30:57.383
HEH. AIN'T THAT RIGHT, MA?

30:57.390 --> 30:59.518
SO, HOW'S YOUR
MOTHER, SPENCER?

30:59.520 --> 31:00.681
SPENCER: YEAH,
SHE'S GOOD.

31:00.690 --> 31:02.556
BUSY, YOU KNOW.
WORK AND DILLON

31:02.560 --> 31:03.857
AND NIGHT SCHOOL
NOW.

31:03.860 --> 31:05.271
WELL, YOU TELL HER
IF SHE NEEDS

31:05.280 --> 31:06.645
ANY HELP WITH DILLON,
I'M HERE.

31:06.650 --> 31:09.529
I'M DOWN TO HELP, TOO.

31:09.530 --> 31:10.600
SPENCER: YEAH, I KNOW.
COOP: OH.

31:23.790 --> 31:25.042
SPENCER: YOU ALL RIGHT,
MISS JANELLE?

31:25.050 --> 31:28.623
I CAN'T DO THIS.
I-I CAN'T DO THIS.

31:28.630 --> 31:30.212
IT'S NOT THE DAUGHTER
I RAISED.

31:30.220 --> 31:32.131
SPENCER: YES, SHE IS.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.710
WHAT'S WRONG WITH Y'ALL?

31:33.720 --> 31:35.597
COOP IS STILL COOP.

31:38.770 --> 31:40.477
SO, IT WASN'T ENOUGH
TO BREAK MY HEART

31:40.480 --> 31:42.016
THE FIRST TIME?

31:42.020 --> 31:43.761
YOU HAD TO BRING ME
BACK TO DO IT AGAIN?

31:43.770 --> 31:45.511
BABY GIRL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.602
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
TAMIA,

31:47.610 --> 31:49.738
BUT I BELIEVE
WHAT I BELIEVE,

31:49.740 --> 31:52.027
AND NOBODY, NOT YOUR FATHER
OR YOUR FRIEND TYRONE,

31:52.030 --> 31:53.737
IS GONNA MAKE ME FEEL
ANY DIFFERENT.

31:53.740 --> 31:55.697
TYRONE? WHAT'S HE
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

31:55.700 --> 31:57.737
-JANELLE, DON'T DO THIS.
-NO, I'M NOT GONNA LIVE

31:57.740 --> 31:59.538
A LIE IN MY OWN HOME,
REGGIE.

32:02.670 --> 32:05.378
THE ONLY REASON THAT
YOU ARE HERE TODAY

32:05.380 --> 32:06.586
IS BECAUSE TYRONE'S
GOT THE HOOKUP

32:06.590 --> 32:08.581
AT YOUR FATHER'S
TRUCK COMPANY,

32:08.590 --> 32:09.830
AND IF YOUR FATHER
DIDN'T BRING YOU HOME,

32:09.840 --> 32:12.719
HE'D LOSE HIS JOB.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.176
YOU WORSE THAN MA.

32:15.850 --> 32:18.262
YOU LET ME HOPE
THINGS WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

32:21.850 --> 32:24.649
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M DOPE AS HELL,

32:24.650 --> 32:26.971
AND Y'ALL GONNA
REALIZE THAT ONE DAY.

32:29.570 --> 32:31.060
THE MESSED-UP PART?

32:31.070 --> 32:33.949
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE
TOO LATE.

32:33.950 --> 32:35.941
MAN: I'M STRESSED OUT,
SIPPIN' THIS

32:35.950 --> 32:37.941
I SUSSED OUT LIVING,
NOW I'M CHILLING WITH MY TEAM

32:37.950 --> 32:39.861
AND THE DREAM, TO BE SURE,
IS WINNING

32:39.870 --> 32:42.612
I'M NOT SKIDDING IN THE BEAMER
BUT BELIEVE IT'S THE BEGINNING

32:42.620 --> 32:45.999
LIFE WILL TURN AROUND ON YOU
SO FAST YOUR HEAD IS SPINNING

32:51.970 --> 32:53.119
HEY, MY BAD.

32:53.130 --> 32:54.757
THOUGHT I'D HAVE
THE PLACE TO MYSELF.

32:54.760 --> 32:55.966
SPENCER: NO, I'M DONE.

32:55.970 --> 32:57.677
IT'S ALL YOU.

32:59.810 --> 33:02.347
HEY, SPENCER, YOU WERE
A FRIEND TO ME

33:02.350 --> 33:03.886
WHEN YOU HAD
NO REASON TO BE.

33:03.890 --> 33:05.722
YOU HELPED ME WITH THAT CRAZY
SITUATION WITH THE PORSCHE

33:05.730 --> 33:08.722
AND YOU DIDN'T
BLOW MY COVER.

33:08.730 --> 33:11.609
I'D LIKE TO RETURN THE
FAVOR WITH SOME ADVICE.

33:11.610 --> 33:12.987
I'M LISTENING.

33:12.990 --> 33:14.731
DON'T MAKE THE SAME
MISTAKE AS I DID

33:14.740 --> 33:17.562
AND LOSE THE BEST THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.

33:17.570 --> 33:20.699
I KNOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND
CRAZY COMING FROM ME...

33:22.790 --> 33:25.031
BUT YOU CAN
TRUST LEILA.

33:25.040 --> 33:28.749
THAT DON'T SOUND
CRAZY AT ALL, MAN.

33:28.750 --> 33:31.833
I KNOW I CAN
TRUST LEILA.

33:31.840 --> 33:35.083
THE PERSON I WASN'T
TRUSTING WAS MYSELF.

33:43.930 --> 33:46.729
YOU KNOW, YOU AND ME
AIN'T ALL THAT DIFFERENT.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.859
AND I THINK I CAN HELP YOU
GET BACK IN WITH THE TEAM.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.521
PRETTY SURE THAT SHIP
HAS ALREADY SAILED, BRO.

33:54.530 --> 33:55.691
WE GONNA NEED SOME
NEW PLAYS TO GO UP

33:55.700 --> 33:57.156
AGAINST LOGAN,
ALL RIGHT?

33:57.160 --> 33:58.150
COACH SAID SO HIMSELF.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.731
SO, IF YOU GOT TIME,
I DON'T KNOW.

34:00.740 --> 34:01.866
MAYBE WE CAN GO
OUT ON THE FIELD.

34:01.870 --> 34:03.690
SEE WHAT WE
COME UP WITH.

34:03.700 --> 34:07.705
MAYBE BRING SOMETHING BACK
THAT ACTUALLY HELPS THE TEAM.

34:07.710 --> 34:09.871
YEAH.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.373
WOMAN: LA-DA-DA,
DA-DA, DA-DA-DA-DA

34:13.380 --> 34:16.759
ASHER: I GOT THE TIME.

34:21.550 --> 34:25.726
WOMAN: I SWEAR TO GOD
IT'S ALMOST EVERY NIGHT

34:25.730 --> 34:27.937
YOU AND 1,
WE BEGIN TO FLY

34:27.940 --> 34:30.853
I'M NOT
LETTING YOU IN.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.146
LOOK, I NEED YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

34:32.150 --> 34:34.391
TYRONE AIN'T THE REASON
I BROUGHT YOU BACK HOME.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.856
THAT WAS ALWAYS
THE PLAN.

34:35.860 --> 34:38.851
BUT I KNEW YOUR MOM
NEEDED MORE TIME.

34:38.860 --> 34:39.940
TYRONE THREATENING
MY JOB,

34:39.949 --> 34:40.940
THAT JUST MADE IT
EASIER FOR ME

34:40.949 --> 34:42.485
TO FORCE
YOUR MOM'S HAND.

34:42.489 --> 34:44.367
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
I WENT ALONG WITH IT.

34:44.370 --> 34:45.826
YOU REALLY EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE YOU WEREN'T

34:45.830 --> 34:47.036
JUST TRYING TO KEEP
YOUR JOB?

34:47.040 --> 34:48.860
I QUIT MY JOB
THIS MORNING.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.291
BUT YOU LOVE
THAT JOB.

34:53.300 --> 34:56.452
I'D RATHER LOSE A JOB
THAN LOSE MY DAUGHTER.

35:05.890 --> 35:07.881
MY EMANCIPATION PAPERS?

35:07.890 --> 35:09.016
PRINTED OUT NEW ONES.

35:09.020 --> 35:10.181
YOUR MOM AND I
SIGNED THEM.

35:10.190 --> 35:11.897
WE'RE GIVING YOU
WHAT YOU WANT

35:11.900 --> 35:14.722
SO YOU CAN KEEP A ROOF
OVER YOUR HEAD.

35:14.730 --> 35:16.437
NOW, THOSE ARE
JUST PAPERS.

35:18.740 --> 35:20.401
YOU'RE STILL
MY DAUGHTER.

35:22.700 --> 35:24.361
AND I AIN'T GONNA
STOP FIGHTING

35:24.370 --> 35:27.112
TILL I REUNITE
MY FAMILY.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.111
WOMAN: IS IT OVER?

35:33.250 --> 35:35.048
IS IT OVER?

35:39.920 --> 35:41.331
SPENCER: I SHOULD'VE
BEEN HONEST WITH YOU,

35:41.340 --> 35:43.752
THAT ASHER MOVING IN WAS
TRIGGERING STUFF FOR ME.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.137
TRIGGERING?

35:45.140 --> 35:47.848
THERE'S A THERAPY WORD
FOR YOU.

35:49.100 --> 35:52.400
YEAH, WELL, I AIN'T GOT
A THERAPIST,

35:52.400 --> 35:54.357
BUT I GOT COOP,

35:54.360 --> 35:57.978
AND...INSTEAD OF
TELLING YOU THE TRUTH,

35:57.980 --> 36:00.199
THAT I DON'T WANT
ASHER LIVING HERE,

36:00.200 --> 36:02.066
AND TRUSTING THAT WE CAN
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION

36:02.070 --> 36:04.778
AND IT NOT END
WITH YOU LEAVING ME,

36:04.780 --> 36:06.657
I LIED.

36:06.660 --> 36:07.866
I MADE IT ABOUT
EVERYTHING ELSE

36:07.870 --> 36:10.749
AND LET IT BUILD UP
UNTIL I SNAPPED,

36:10.750 --> 36:11.956
AND THAT WASN'T
FAIR ON YOU.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.746
WHY WOULD YOU THINK
YOU COULDN'T BE HONEST

36:13.750 --> 36:16.082
WITH ME ABOUT
YOUR FEELINGS?

36:16.090 --> 36:18.206
THAT I'D LEAVE
JUST BECAUSE

36:18.210 --> 36:20.872
WE HAD A DIFFERENCE
IN OPINION?

36:22.970 --> 36:25.962
-LOOK.
-YOUR--YOUR DAD.

36:25.970 --> 36:27.711
IT'S BECAUSE
HE LEFT.

36:27.720 --> 36:30.883
IT'S CRAZY.
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

36:30.890 --> 36:32.847
HE'S STILL GOT THAT
KIND OF HOLD ON ME.

36:32.850 --> 36:35.729
HEY, I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

36:35.730 --> 36:39.894
THERE ARE A LOT OF US
WHO AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

36:39.900 --> 36:41.436
THE FACT THAT
YOUR DAD LEFT

36:41.440 --> 36:42.771
DOESN'T
HAVE ANYTHING

36:42.780 --> 36:44.100
TO DO WITH
WHO YOU ARE

36:44.110 --> 36:46.112
AND EVERYTHING TO DO
WITH WHO HE IS.

36:46.120 --> 36:54.073
YOU'RE AMAZING AND KIND
AND FRUSTRATING.

36:54.080 --> 36:57.459
YOU'RE A GOOD
PERSON, SPENCER,

36:57.460 --> 37:03.046
AND AN INCREDIBLY
EASY PERSON TO LOVE.

37:06.010 --> 37:08.809
TRUST THAT.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.130
I'M WORKING ON IT.

37:10.140 --> 37:12.848
WE'LL WORK ON IT
TOGETHER.

37:12.850 --> 37:14.978
YEAH.

37:14.980 --> 37:17.642
WOMAN: OHH

37:17.650 --> 37:20.529
OHH

37:20.530 --> 37:22.350
OOH

37:22.360 --> 37:23.987
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

37:23.990 --> 37:27.028
WOMAN: OOH, OOH, OOH, OCH

37:27.030 --> 37:31.069
OOH, OOH, OOH, OOH

37:46.300 --> 37:50.589
KODALINE: IT'S HARDER TO SEE
THROUGH THE EYES OF A STRANGER

37:53.060 --> 37:57.429
IT'S EASY TO LOVE WHEN
THE WORLD DOESN'T HATE YA

37:59.520 --> 38:04.936
WHEN YOU TRYING TO SEND OUT
BUT NOBODY HEARS A WORD

38:06.400 --> 38:10.985
IT'S SAFER TO SWIM WHEN
THE TIDE'S NOT AGAINST YA

38:10.990 --> 38:12.480
LIV, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY, HEY.

38:12.490 --> 38:15.209
HEY, COME ON, COME ON,
HEY, COME ON.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.202
SOMEBODY, MOM, SOMEBODY,
HEY, HEY, HEY,

38:18.210 --> 38:20.121
COME HERE, COME HERE,
MOM, DAD.

38:20.130 --> 38:21.950
LAURA: WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED?

38:21.960 --> 38:23.200
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT HAPPENED?

38:23.210 --> 38:24.757
JORDAN: WOKE UP
AND SHE WAS LIKE THIS...

38:24.760 --> 38:25.750
LAURA: WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

38:25.760 --> 38:27.080
JORDAN: WE--

38:27.090 --> 38:30.003
KODALINE: T'LL SHED
A TEAR FOR YOU

38:30.010 --> 38:31.296
GET THE WATER.

38:31.300 --> 38:33.052
OPEN YOUR EYES,
I'M BY YOUR SIDE

38:33.060 --> 38:36.803
I'M NEVER LEAVING YOU

38:36.810 --> 38:40.053
DARKNESS TO LIGHT,
STAY THROUGH THE NIGHT

38:40.060 --> 38:44.224
I'M WALKING IN YOUR SHOES

38:44.230 --> 38:46.983
SO YOU KNOW
THAT IT'S THE TRUTH

38:46.990 --> 38:50.779
WHEN NOBODY'S HERE FOR YOU

38:50.780 --> 38:52.362
LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR...

38:52.370 --> 38:54.782
OLIVIA.

38:54.790 --> 38:59.910
SHED A TEAR, SHED A TEAR,
SHED A TEAR, SHED A TEAR

38:59.920 --> 39:01.035
WE CELEBRATE
YOUR HONESTY

39:01.040 --> 39:03.543
AND YOUR COMMITMENT
TO YOURSELF

39:03.550 --> 39:05.120
AND THE ONES
YOU LOVE,

39:05.130 --> 39:07.212
AND WE COMMEMORATE
THIS DAY

39:07.220 --> 39:09.120
WITH YOUR ONE-YEAR
SOBRIETY MEDALLION.

39:09.130 --> 39:10.928
KODALINE:
I'll TAKE THE BLAME

39:10.930 --> 39:12.841
YOU DID IT.

39:15.060 --> 39:18.269
KODALINE: OPEN YOUR EYES,
I'M BY YOUR SIDE

39:19.310 --> 39:21.802
I'M NEVER LEAVING YOU

39:21.810 --> 39:25.223
DARKNESS OR LIGHT,
STAY THROUGH THE NIGHT

39:25.230 --> 39:29.064
I'M WALKING IN YOUR SHOES

39:29.070 --> 39:30.060
SO YOU KNOW THAT IT'S...

39:30.070 --> 39:32.778
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
HAD PLANS.

39:32.780 --> 39:35.283
SOMEONE MORE IMPORTANT
CAME UP.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.941
KODALINE:
LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR

39:37.950 --> 39:40.078
I'll SHED A,
I'll SHED A TEAR

39:40.080 --> 39:41.320
SHED A TEAR,
SHED A TEAR

39:41.330 --> 39:43.788
I'll SHED A,
I'll SHED A TEAR

39:43.790 --> 39:45.246
SHED A TEAR

39:45.250 --> 39:47.161
I'll SHED A,
I'll SHED A TEAR

39:47.170 --> 39:48.160
SHED A TEAR,
SHED A TEAR

39:48.170 --> 39:50.582
I'll SHED A,
I'll SHED A TEAR

39:50.590 --> 39:52.046
SHED A TEAR

39:52.050 --> 39:55.133
I'll SHED A,
I'll SHED A TEAR

39:56.470 --> 39:59.178
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T TELL
YOU ABOUT JORDAN, BABY.

39:59.180 --> 40:03.014
YOU KNOW, WE ALREADY WENT
THROUGH THIS WITH OLIVIA.

40:03.020 --> 40:06.320
AND HANDLED IT...
POORLY.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.810
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT THIS IS--

40:07.820 --> 40:09.310
THIS ISN'T
THE SAME THINGS.

40:09.320 --> 40:12.028
WE ALREADY KNOW OLIVIA
HAS AN ADDICTIVE PERSONALITY.

40:12.030 --> 40:13.771
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT
THAT'S NOT THE CASE

40:13.780 --> 40:15.270
FOR JORDAN, TOO?

40:15.280 --> 40:16.270
MY POINT IS, IS THAT

40:16.280 --> 40:18.533
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE TOGETHER.

40:18.540 --> 40:22.249
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE PARTNERS.

40:22.250 --> 40:26.209
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:26.210 --> 40:29.202
WE NEED TO BE HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER,

40:29.210 --> 40:30.257
NO MATTER THE COST.

40:30.260 --> 40:33.082
YEAH. NO MATTER
THE COST.

40:33.090 --> 40:35.422
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE TO THE STORY.

40:39.560 --> 40:42.188
I, UH...

40:42.190 --> 40:44.306
I-I DID SOMETHING
THAT, UH,

40:44.310 --> 40:46.768
THAT I CAN'T
TAKE BACK,

40:46.770 --> 40:49.569
AND IF IT GETS OUT,

40:49.570 --> 40:53.359
NOT ONLY COULD IT
COST ME MY JOB,

40:53.360 --> 40:56.068
IT COULD COMPROMISE
YOUR--YOUR CAMPAIGN

40:56.070 --> 40:59.825
AND JORDAN'S
ELIGIBILITY.

40:59.830 --> 41:01.070
WHAT DID YOU DO,
BILLY?

41:01.080 --> 41:03.572
I SWAPPED OUT
JORDAN'S URINE SAMPLE

41:03.580 --> 41:05.241
AT A DRUG TEST.

41:05.250 --> 41:06.820
HE WAS GONNA FAIL,

41:06.830 --> 41:08.207
AND I JUST WANTED TO

41:08.210 --> 41:09.746
PROTECT OUR SON.

41:13.340 --> 41:14.466
I KNOW.

41:14.470 --> 41:19.169
OK. OK.

41:25.980 --> 41:29.473
WE'LL FIGURE THIS
OUT TOGETHER.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.226
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
