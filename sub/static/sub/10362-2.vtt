00:22.480 --> 00:24.000
[gunshots echo]

00:24.080 --> 00:27.880
I'm gonna give you the cocksucker,
but I got some demands.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.000
I'm thinking Lilyhammer.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.680
[agent] Look, here's the file
to your new identity.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.440
From now on,
you're Giovanni Henriksen.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.320
- To new beginnings.
- New beginnings.

00:37.400 --> 00:44.000
Six-month daily course for immigrants who
struggle to adapt to Norwegian society.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.280
Is this blackmail?

00:45.360 --> 00:46.720
Definitely.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.040
And this is gonna be my teacher.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.600
[agent]  If you get into any, and I mean
any trouble with the police,

00:51.680 --> 00:53.080
you are on your own.

00:53.160 --> 00:54.680
[gunshot echoes]

00:54.760 --> 00:58.520
[in Norwegian] I'd like to run
a background check on Giovanni Henriksen.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.120
Oh?

01:03.200 --> 01:05.600
[theme music playing]

01:56.360 --> 01:58.520
[in Norwegian]
What are you doing, Viggo?

01:58.600 --> 02:00.800
I just gave the window a squirt.

02:00.880 --> 02:04.600
Yes, and it's the third time since FÃ¥berg.
You think wiper-fluid is free?

02:04.680 --> 02:06.000
- No.
- No?

02:09.280 --> 02:10.920
What the hell is that?

02:26.840 --> 02:31.720
- [Viggo] Hello! Hello!
- [man breathing heavily]

02:38.080 --> 02:39.760
There ain't no one here.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.920
[man shivering]

02:57.360 --> 02:59.600
Olive oil, it says here.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.480
This ain't olive oil, Viggo.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.320
Ah.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.560
Sweet.

03:14.440 --> 03:21.040
I have chosen to call
this course "New Start,"

03:21.120 --> 03:25.400
because that is exactly
what you will get here.

03:25.480 --> 03:29.360
A new chance to get to know

03:29.440 --> 03:34.480
the multi-headed, but basically pleasant,
troll we call Norwegian society.

03:34.560 --> 03:38.560
We have found a resourceful person
when it comes to the multicultural,

03:38.640 --> 03:40.160
Sigrid Haugli.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.640
[Sigrid]
Thank you for those kind words, Jan.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.080
[Jan] Mm.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.400
[quietly]
Is he on this list of participants?

03:49.480 --> 03:53.360
Yes, indeed.
He's a last-minute addition.

03:53.440 --> 03:58.600
Okay, good luck
with the verbal interaction.

03:58.680 --> 04:03.680
Yes? So, let's start on page three.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.320
Yes?

04:05.400 --> 04:08.240
[in English] Hypothetically,
you know, if a man likes

04:08.320 --> 04:10.320
a Norwegian woman he met on a train,

04:10.400 --> 04:14.200
and he keeps running into her
now and then,

04:14.280 --> 04:16.360
uh, where would they go from there?

04:18.440 --> 04:20.920
Uh...

04:21.000 --> 04:23.400
[in Norwegian]
I think maybe we should focus on

04:23.480 --> 04:27.960
questions relating to the text... today.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.640
I hope you've thought about
what we're doing here.

04:34.720 --> 04:38.160
[Roar] A good taxi driver has a radar
that tells him what's worth doing.

04:38.240 --> 04:41.320
And this, Viggo, I promise you,
is worth doing.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.040
Oh, fuck! We gotta go.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.400
Shit. My nose ring!

04:50.480 --> 04:53.720
- I must have got it caught on something.
- Never mind that!

04:53.800 --> 04:56.520
My girlfriend gave it to me for Christmas!

04:56.600 --> 04:57.640
Come on, Viggo.

04:57.720 --> 04:58.960
Viggo!

05:09.280 --> 05:10.960
- [whispering]   Sigrid?
- Yes?

05:11.040 --> 05:12.000
Can I just...

05:12.080 --> 05:14.520
- Please, come in.
- Great.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.480
I forgot this.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.320
I just wanted to inform you
about the activities we offer.

05:20.400 --> 05:25.960
On Tuesdays the theater group,
Rainbow, has its get-togethers. Exciting.

05:26.040 --> 05:30.520
On Thursday we have self-defense classes
for minority women.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.920
I am in charge of this one myself.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.600
[Jan chuckles]

05:36.120 --> 05:40.600
And then, the icing on the cake,
the big ice-skating day.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.080
And do we look forward to that?

05:42.160 --> 05:44.520
- Yeah...
- [Jan] I didn't quite hear?

05:44.600 --> 05:45.560
[others shouting]
Yes!

05:45.640 --> 05:48.600
- Of course we're looking forward to it!
- Great. Thanks, Jan.

05:48.680 --> 05:53.040
So, let's continue with how to greet
someone in Norwegian.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.800
Hello,

05:54.880 --> 05:57.720
my name is Sigrid.
I come from Lillehammer.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.160
[speaking in foreign language]

06:02.240 --> 06:03.720
[Sigrid in Norwegian] What?

06:03.800 --> 06:05.560
What is he saying?

06:05.640 --> 06:09.960
[continues speaking
in foreign language]

06:10.040 --> 06:14.040
[in Norwegian] He says that it is haram
for him to take a woman's hand.

06:15.760 --> 06:16.720
Yes.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.840
Yes?

06:18.920 --> 06:22.240
Okay, I think it's time
for a little break,

06:22.320 --> 06:25.480
and we'll continue
with the greeting afterwards.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.600
[toilet flushing]

06:34.880 --> 06:36.760
[Johnny in English]
Hey, towelhead.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.520
What?

06:38.600 --> 06:44.200
Listen, you might wrap your women
like mummies back in Taliban country,

06:44.280 --> 06:48.280
but here, we treat
our broads with respect.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.920
Comprende?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.680
Get your hands off me.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.040
You're not listening.

06:54.120 --> 06:57.480
Next chance you get,
you're gonna shake that teacher's hand

06:57.560 --> 06:59.920
and shut the fuck up about it, you got it?

07:02.440 --> 07:06.680
Don't make me get emotional
about this little misunderstanding.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.480
Okay... Okay.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.120
Good.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.960
Now, get out.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.480
[in Norwegian]
You should attend the skating course.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.080
- [in English] Funny.
- Hello.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.920
[in Norwegian]
My name is Yusuf.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.360
You don't have to if you don't want to.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.200
[in English] Take my hand, please.

07:58.720 --> 08:02.360
[in Norwegian] What kind of idiot drives
around without chains in these conditions?

08:02.440 --> 08:03.560
[speaking Italian]

08:03.640 --> 08:05.840
[driver in English]
Please, please.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.480
- [in Norwegian] Bloody incompetent dago.
- [in English] Please...

08:07.560 --> 08:10.280
[in Norwegian]
There was enough booze for 300,000.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.120
What is this?

08:24.120 --> 08:26.760
Have we been robbed
by a bunch of bitches?

08:27.920 --> 08:31.680
I would say we're looking for a guy
who likes to decorate himself.

08:37.160 --> 08:39.280
[Torgeir]
"When does the bus come?

08:39.360 --> 08:42.560
The bus comes now."
This is easy.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.640
[in English]
Ain't you done yet?

08:44.720 --> 08:46.680
[in Norwegian]
I don't see the point of a Norwegian class

08:46.760 --> 08:48.960
if you don't do the homework yourself.

08:49.040 --> 08:50.600
- Hello, guys.
- Hi, Roar.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.880
Your confirmation jacket?

08:53.960 --> 08:55.720
Yeah, never goes out of fashion this,
you know.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.840
Well, I beg to differ.

08:57.920 --> 09:01.280
Now I have a little surprise for you.

09:01.360 --> 09:04.960
A pub owner I know went bankrupt.

09:05.040 --> 09:09.400
I have 30 more boxes in the car,
if you're interested.

09:10.360 --> 09:11.680
Cheers.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.120
[in English] How much?

09:18.200 --> 09:24.640
[in Norwegian] Over the counter this lot
would knock you back about 200. So... 150.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.760
[in English]
That ain't gonna happen.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.520
[in Norwegian]
A hundred?

09:34.600 --> 09:37.240
- A hundred?
- [in English] How about 50?

09:37.320 --> 09:39.960
[in Norwegian]
I need at least 100 for this.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.440
[in English]
We got a deal or not?

09:42.520 --> 09:45.000
[in Norwegian]
Seventy-five... 75.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.840
[in English] Okay, fuck it then.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.560
- Fifty's great.
- Yeah. 50.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.080
[in Norwegian] Cheers.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.640
[in English] Tell you a little story
about a hero of mine,

09:59.720 --> 10:03.520
a gentleman named Benjamin Siegel.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.760
Don't call him Bugsy.

10:06.880 --> 10:12.520
One day, he decided to build
the world's greatest club...

10:12.600 --> 10:15.360
in the middle of a desert.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.800
Well, everybody laughed.

10:17.880 --> 10:22.280
But today, that place is called Las Vegas.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.440
Hear, hear!

10:25.200 --> 10:27.880
We have the same opportunity.

10:28.960 --> 10:34.320
And when we're done, people are going
to forget the Olympics were ever here.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.200
[woman in Norwegian] Okay.

10:40.280 --> 10:43.480
Have you thought who's going to be
in charge of the HMS?

10:44.960 --> 10:46.760
[in English] What's that?

10:46.840 --> 10:49.840
Uh, it's... [clears throat] union stuff.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.480
Are there any non-union-related questions?

10:54.560 --> 10:58.680
[in Norwegian] This is violating
the Working Environment Act.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.160
[in English]
It's against the law.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.080
I'm glad you brought that up.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.640
You're fired.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.960
[in Norwegian]   You understand?

11:08.040 --> 11:10.560
[in English]
Get the fuck out.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.240
Get out.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.440
Anybody else wanna join the union?

11:21.720 --> 11:24.520
Those were the best-looking
waitresses you could find?

11:24.600 --> 11:25.520
Yep.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.680
Half of those broads are
on the wrong side of menopause.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.080
[in Norwegian] Sorry, boss,
but the employment office...

11:30.160 --> 11:32.280
[in English]
ain't exactly a model agency, you know?

11:32.360 --> 11:34.880
Listen, listen, listen.
You represent me now.

11:34.960 --> 11:39.720
You've gotta let that caged lion
of creativity that's inside you run free.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.600
[in Norwegian]
Okay, boss. I'll try.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.640
[in English]
I'll try that. Okay?

11:43.720 --> 11:46.640
[in Norwegian] Johnny?
There's a policeman here asking for you.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.480
- [in English] What, now?
- [in Norwegian] Yes, right away.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.360
[in English] All right.

11:52.520 --> 11:54.920
Fuckin' what now? What now?

11:56.520 --> 11:58.720
Officer, what can we do for you?

11:58.800 --> 12:02.760
[in Norwegian] I just wondered
what's happening with the gig?

12:02.840 --> 12:03.920
[in English] Gig?

12:05.160 --> 12:07.320
[in Norwegian]
Well, my band had an agreement

12:07.400 --> 12:11.120
with the last owner about playing
here once a month.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.000
I'm sure you've seen the poster
that's hanging...

12:14.080 --> 12:16.840
that was hanging over there.

12:16.920 --> 12:20.000
[in English] Uh...
What was the name of the act again?

12:20.080 --> 12:21.640
Geir "Elvis."

12:22.880 --> 12:26.320
Elvis? What's that?
Elvis doing Judy Garland songs?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.800
Gay Elvis?

12:27.880 --> 12:30.720
No, Geir "Elvis."

12:34.200 --> 12:36.120
Well, listen,

12:36.200 --> 12:39.280
I am sure you are terrific, okay?

12:39.360 --> 12:42.240
But, uh, I didn't know anything about it.

12:42.320 --> 12:45.160
We already booked
a band for opening night.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.160
So, uh...

12:47.240 --> 12:49.880
It's okay.
We'll fit you into the future, that's all.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.640
Okay, well, you call me?

12:53.720 --> 12:55.160
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.240
- Fine. Thank you.
- You got it.

13:00.200 --> 13:03.480
Gay Elvis? What's next,
a straight Liberace?

13:03.560 --> 13:06.080
[all laughing]

13:33.800 --> 13:35.840
[in Norwegian]
Did you get any response

13:35.920 --> 13:39.080
on the background check
on Giovanni Henriksen?

13:39.160 --> 13:41.120
Yes, it was rather odd.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.360
There were big gaps in his biography.

13:44.440 --> 13:47.880
There's something fishy about that guy.

13:47.960 --> 13:51.560
Says he's American,
but looks more like an Arab.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.000
I'm sure it's just some computer mess-up.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.240
Doesn't even like Elvis.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.640
[man over radio]  Control to U-05.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.680
U-05 answering.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.360
Armed robbery at the DnB Nor Bank
on Strandtorget.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.840
Five men with machine guns,
heading downtown.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.160
We're on the way.

14:09.240 --> 14:12.200
- [siren wailing]
- Hold on.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.160
[Geir] Something's finally happening here.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.840
- Watch out.
- Wait.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.760
Excuse me, but didn't that branch
close down last spring?

14:18.840 --> 14:21.320
Quite right. Just kidding.
All calm and quiet here, as always.

14:21.400 --> 14:25.160
This radio is not a toy,
you know. Assholes.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.960
[chuckling]

14:31.080 --> 14:32.720
[Geir sighing]

14:36.960 --> 14:40.680
If you're out on the town,
this spray is a must.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.960
But there are also techniques that
can be useful. Come up here, Svetlana.

14:44.040 --> 14:48.120
I am now a defenseless
minority-background girl,

14:48.200 --> 14:50.280
and you are
a tiresome guy from Gausdal.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.360
I walk like this.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.320
And you grab me from behind.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.880
- Up here.
- "Oh, no! I lost the pepper spray!"

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
That's how we do it.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.600
Ticklish!

15:03.680 --> 15:05.240
[Jan laughing]

15:05.320 --> 15:07.200
[clapping]

15:11.960 --> 15:13.960
Take a couple of minutes, girls.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.680
Hey, there.

15:16.720 --> 15:19.400
[in English] Recruiting for a new workshop
at the cabin, I see.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.960
Just kidding.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.320
I'm here for a favor, actually.

15:24.400 --> 15:28.040
We need some pretty bartenders,
you know, down at the Flamingo?

15:28.120 --> 15:30.640
I thought,
"Let's go see my pal Jan,

15:30.720 --> 15:32.480
because who knows better than him

15:32.560 --> 15:35.400
those that are both unemployed
and good-looking?"

15:36.480 --> 15:37.920
[chuckles]

15:38.000 --> 15:41.280
[in Norwegian]
No... I can't do that.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.040
[in English] Jan, let's not make this
more complicated than it has to be.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.520
[in Norwegian] Jelena, Svetlana,
can you come over here?

16:07.480 --> 16:09.280
- Hello.
- Hello.

16:09.360 --> 16:13.360
Two minute-beefsteaks.
Well-done.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.520
Okay.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.280
One of the problems is...

16:20.360 --> 16:21.880
[scoffs]

16:23.600 --> 16:25.240
[changing channels]

16:25.320 --> 16:27.600

[Yusuf speaking in foreign language]

16:53.880 --> 16:57.720
What's the problem, pal?
What is he saying?

16:57.800 --> 17:03.080
My brother says that series
shows no respect for Arabs.

17:03.160 --> 17:06.480
"Shows no respect for Arabs."
Let me tell you something, buddy.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.880
In Norway we have the Constitution.

17:08.960 --> 17:12.920
It says I can watch TV
whenever I want. Got it?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.360
[speaking in foreign language]

17:15.440 --> 17:18.120
[in Norwegian]
Is there a problem here?

17:18.200 --> 17:20.400
[speaking in foreign language]

17:20.480 --> 17:24.960
[in Norwegian]
Can't you just finish cooking my food?

17:25.040 --> 17:27.280
Don't stand here arguing with me!

17:27.360 --> 17:30.960
Tell him I can call the health department
tomorrow and close down the joint.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.000
Hey!
Hey! What's going on here?

17:43.080 --> 17:45.880
This idiot is giving me the whole
Mullah Krekar routine here.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.960
Geir, go back to the car now.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.200
No. Right away.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.560
[speaking in foreign language]

17:51.640 --> 17:53.720
[in Norwegian]
I'm sorry about that.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.320
That's okay.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.120
He's usually not like that.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.680
You have to do something
about your temper.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.920
Here.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.920
What can I do for you?

18:17.000 --> 18:20.240
I've lost this one here,
so I'm looking for a new ring.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.440
Okay.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.600
Just a second,
I'll talk to my boss about it.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.000
[Viggo] Okay.

18:54.600 --> 18:55.960
[crushing beer can]

19:27.840 --> 19:30.320
[in English] Hello.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.600
I didn't know you Norskies were so good
at waste management.

19:38.040 --> 19:42.040
[in Norwegian] We in Lillehammer know
to value our friends.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.000
Since the special coffee was
to your liking,

19:57.080 --> 19:59.360
we wanted to give you your own...

19:59.440 --> 20:01.800
[in English]
do-it-yourself package.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.440
Yeah.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.120
I just hope this shit is safe,

20:05.200 --> 20:06.920
'cause it looks like the fucking
Beverly Hillbillies over here.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.120

Come to me. Come, come, come.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.800

20:32.880 --> 20:35.720
Come on, let's make a skating train.

20:37.280 --> 20:41.320

20:45.400 --> 20:47.680

21:04.840 --> 21:06.520
[in Norwegian]
What do you think?

21:06.600 --> 21:09.800
[in English] You look like Nancy Kerrigan
before she got whacked.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.640
[in Norwegian] I've arranged for some food
for the evening course.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.520
- Could you help me?
- [in English] Oh, yeah, sure.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.840
I'll bring Lawrence of Arabia,
he doesn't seem too busy at the moment.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.800
Okay.

21:21.400 --> 21:25.280
[in Norwegian] I thought
we could change the set order.

21:25.360 --> 21:28.360
Start with "Hound Dog."

21:28.440 --> 21:31.560
Huh? Wouldn't that be nice?

21:40.680 --> 21:43.080
What the fuck?
I'll call you back.

- [in Norwegian] Does it hurt?
- Don't touch the leg!

22:28.320 --> 22:33.000
- Hold on. I have bandages...
- Don't do it!

22:33.080 --> 22:35.720
[in English] No Band-Aid's gonna fix this.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.560

And did we take a number for the line?

23:04.000 --> 23:06.280
[in Norwegian]
I think I may have broken it.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.840
Well, that'll be up to the doctor
to decide, won't it.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.200
Whoops, what happened?
That's wrong.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.400
You'll have to give me your ID number
one more time.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.440
- Twenty-three...
- [in English] Okay, enough!

23:15.520 --> 23:19.200

Hi, you must be Sigrid's friend.
I got her message.

24:32.720 --> 24:36.600
Yeah. What about those punks,
are they gonna be punished for this?

24:36.680 --> 24:40.720
Oh, no, we believe that dialogue is
a much more effective weapon

24:40.800 --> 24:43.640
against this kind of anti-social behavior.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.080
Interesting theory.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.120
Let's go.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.360
[in Norwegian] We've talked
about this so many times...

All this talk,  snakke...

It's no good.
It's not gonna get you any respect.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.880
Here's what you gotta do.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.960
Next time you see that kid,

25:17.040 --> 25:21.000
the leader there,
the one with the yellow jacket...

25:21.080 --> 25:22.800
- Finn?
- Finn.

25:22.880 --> 25:25.720
You go up to this Finn, right?

25:25.800 --> 25:28.800
And you don't say nothin',

25:28.880 --> 25:34.280
but you got a mitten,
and you fill it with rocks,  stein.

25:34.360 --> 25:37.800
And you smack him just like that,
right on the nose.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.480
Problem solved.

I'd like to take you dancing.

26:27.640 --> 26:29.720
Sounds nice.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.280
Slow-dancing, of course.

Put your arm around my shoulder, come on.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.200
[in Norwegian]
Are you leaving?

30:36.280 --> 30:37.720
[in English]
I got a little crisis at the club.

30:37.800 --> 30:41.800
Um... Listen, I had a great
time last night, teacher.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.520
Me, too.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.960
- See you later. All right?
- Okay. Okay.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.200
[door opening]

30:59.280 --> 31:02.160
[in Norwegian]
Laila! You got a minute?

31:02.240 --> 31:04.280
No, sorry.

31:04.360 --> 31:08.240
But I think I'm on to something big.
You have to see.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.320
It'll have to wait.
I've got an interrogation.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.160
Yeah, but take--

31:12.240 --> 31:13.760
[huffs]

31:13.840 --> 31:15.520
[mutters]

31:15.600 --> 31:18.880
Hey there.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.720
- Laila Hovland.
- Mariann Aass.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.960
You look well, Laila.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.400
Lost some weight?

31:26.480 --> 31:31.400
On the contrary. Didn't you lose
your license to practice last year?

31:31.520 --> 31:32.960
[chuckling]

31:33.040 --> 31:35.960
No, no, no, that was
just a trifling little matter.

31:36.040 --> 31:38.640
Okay.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.880
When you win a large sum
at the Biri Racetrack

31:58.960 --> 32:01.200
without remembering
the name of a single horse,

32:01.280 --> 32:04.840
excuse me, but you must realize
that we suspect you of money laundering?

32:04.920 --> 32:06.920
- Well, it's...
- [knocking on door]

32:07.000 --> 32:09.720
- [quietly] What do I say again?
- Hmm?

32:09.800 --> 32:11.720
[knocking continues]

32:11.800 --> 32:12.920
What is it?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.320
You really need to come out here now.

32:14.400 --> 32:19.080
[sighs] Okay.
We are not finished here.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.760
Listen, Mariann,
you can't ask me what I think.

32:27.880 --> 32:32.640
Here is Suleyman Bhatti,
terror suspect, on the lam in Scandinavia.

32:32.720 --> 32:35.480
- Right? Giovanni Henriksen.
- Yeah?

32:35.560 --> 32:38.360
And here. Photoshopped a little,
removed the beard and the mustache.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.960
You see?

32:41.040 --> 32:44.760
Giovanni Henriksen is Suleyman Bhatti.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.520
[laughing]

32:47.600 --> 32:50.080
Honestly, Geir. I really think you've
been watching too much  24.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.560
- No, no...
- [speaking indistinctly]

32:52.640 --> 32:53.680
But I saw...

32:53.760 --> 32:57.080
Yesterday I saw Giovanni receive
some packages by some Mullah dudes.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.360
Pretty radical-looking folks.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.240
Did you sleep here last night?

33:03.320 --> 33:04.720
So what?

33:04.800 --> 33:07.240
My uncle worked here at the station during
the Bouchiki case in '73.

33:07.320 --> 33:10.000
That seemed far-fetched, too.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.640
Go home, and go to bed.

33:11.720 --> 33:14.400
Thanks for being here.

33:14.480 --> 33:18.720
- Hey, didn't you work here in '73--
- [Laila] Geir, go home!

33:18.800 --> 33:21.400
Then you say, "No comment."

33:21.480 --> 33:22.960
[Laila] Sorry about that.

33:23.040 --> 33:24.160
INTERVIEW IN PROGRESS

33:24.240 --> 33:26.840
[in English] Any idea where
we could find these fuckers?

33:26.920 --> 33:30.080
[in Norwegian] Apparently one of them
usually hangs out at the diner in Tretten.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.480
[Johnny] Mmm-hmm. All right.

33:33.880 --> 33:36.440
Let's go take care
of a little business, huh?

34:00.920 --> 34:02.200
[Johny] That him?

34:02.280 --> 34:03.920
Yeah.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.480
[Torgeir in Norwegian]
We can't get to him in there.

34:07.560 --> 34:12.080
[in English] Don't worry,
I think he'll come to us.

34:12.160 --> 34:13.840
[car engine starting]

34:13.920 --> 34:15.520
[tires screeching]

34:22.200 --> 34:24.760
[in Norwegian]
Hey, are you blind or something?

34:24.840 --> 34:26.920
[Arne groaning]

34:27.000 --> 34:29.040
Looks like your bike has
a little fucking problem.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.160
How about we give you a ride?

34:31.240 --> 34:34.560
You're taking us to where your pals
have my goods, you understand?

34:34.640 --> 34:36.560
[in Norwegian] You'd better tell him
my English ain't all that good.

34:36.640 --> 34:41.200
Don't play the fool.
Where does your gang hang out?

34:41.280 --> 34:44.240
None of your fuckin' business.

34:44.320 --> 34:47.720
[in English] All right, all right,
all right, all right, all right.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.520
This guy obviously needs
a little extra motivation.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.520
Bring him. Come on.

34:52.600 --> 34:55.200
[grunting]

34:55.280 --> 34:57.120
He's heavy.

34:57.200 --> 35:00.200
Hey, hey, hey.
Peter Fonda, you see that?

35:00.280 --> 35:01.480
[in Norwegian]
Okay, okay.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.240
[in English] Let's go.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.480
[panting]

35:09.800 --> 35:11.440
You sure you don't wanna talk?

35:11.520 --> 35:13.440
[in Norwegian] You're bluffing.

35:13.520 --> 35:18.000
You're bluffing.
You can't be that crazy.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.520
He's hyperventilating.

35:20.600 --> 35:24.360
Breathe with your diaphragm.
There's nothing so dangerous about this.

35:24.440 --> 35:28.360
My old skis work just fine.

35:28.440 --> 35:32.240
Stop fuckin' with me.
Get me off the bar.

35:32.320 --> 35:33.840
I'll get you off the bar.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.600
[screaming]

35:39.200 --> 35:41.320
[screaming continues]

35:49.200 --> 35:50.640
Are you hurt?

35:50.720 --> 35:52.280
[coughing]

35:52.360 --> 35:55.120
[groans]

35:55.200 --> 35:58.600
Good distance, but maybe some
points off for the unsatisfactory landing.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.040
[in English] I think we should provide him
the opportunity to,

36:01.120 --> 36:04.840
you know, improve his score
with a second run.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.440
Yes, I agree.

36:06.520 --> 36:10.880
[in Norwegian]
Please, no more. No more.

36:10.960 --> 36:14.640
Name, social security number,
home address and signature.

36:18.440 --> 36:21.040
[in English] Take it easy.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.400
Time for a sit-down
with you, gentlemen.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.680
I'm just a simple club owner,

36:31.760 --> 36:34.400
trying to keep
his patrons' glasses filled.

36:34.480 --> 36:37.600
If you think you can beat up
one of my guys,

36:37.680 --> 36:39.520
how do you say...

36:39.600 --> 36:41.400
[in Norwegian]
What is it called?  Ustraffa.

36:41.480 --> 36:43.400
[in English]
Going unpunished.

36:43.480 --> 36:45.720
Please, you can speak Norwegian.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.160
I'm a dedicated student to your culture.

36:48.240 --> 36:51.280
[in Norwegian]
This will have consequences.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.480
[Johnny in English] Well, you started it.

36:53.560 --> 36:56.320
You beat up one of my guys,
I beat up one of yours.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.680
You take a finger,
I'm gonna take an arm.

36:58.760 --> 37:01.320
In the end, nobody wins.

37:01.400 --> 37:02.640
[scoffs]

37:02.720 --> 37:04.960
[in Norwegian] Well, we don't negotiate
with thieving scoundrels.

37:05.040 --> 37:08.480
[in English] Enough with the drama, huh?
I got screwed, too.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.560
I didn't know it was stolen.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.480
I got a suggestion.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.560
You give me the booze,

37:15.640 --> 37:18.080
I'll collect the money
from the guy who sold it.

37:18.160 --> 37:21.640
[in Norwegian] You surely understand
that this is about more than the booze.

37:23.240 --> 37:26.440
[in English] Been reading the papers.

37:26.560 --> 37:29.400
Got a little problem
with the local cops, huh?

37:29.480 --> 37:33.000
Money laundering?

37:33.080 --> 37:37.000
So I can get rid of a couple
of pots of coffee every day.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.400
Fabricating band fees.
Capisce?

37:45.080 --> 37:48.720
[in Norwegian]
You're not considering this--

37:48.800 --> 37:52.280
[in English] Could mean another
100,000 kroner a month.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.360
Minus an administrative fee.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.000
[in Norwegian] If you will permit
your lawyer to make a comment,

37:58.080 --> 38:01.360
this guy does have some
very interesting ideas.

38:10.640 --> 38:12.920
Okay. I'll give it to you.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.800
Seriously. Look at me.

38:15.880 --> 38:17.000
[scoffs]

38:17.080 --> 38:21.280
I thought I'd die.
They threw me off the ski jump.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.360
[laughing]

38:29.720 --> 38:32.280
[lively chattering]

38:36.080 --> 38:39.280
- [in English] We good to go, baby?
- Yes.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.520
Whoa! What a jacket!

38:41.600 --> 38:44.360
Yeah, baby.
What do you think?

38:44.440 --> 38:46.560
- Hmm?
- [cell phone ringing]

38:46.640 --> 38:48.680
I gotta take this.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.200
Hey, teach.

38:50.280 --> 38:52.920
Something wrong with my homework?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.800
[Johnny chuckling]

38:57.520 --> 39:01.080
[in Norwegian]
Is it a bit too much, this jacket?

39:01.160 --> 39:03.600
Oh, no, you look great.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.200
Yeah, exactly.

39:09.520 --> 39:11.160
I'm just calling to say
thank you so much...

39:11.240 --> 39:13.600
[in English]  for the flowers
and the invitation for tonight.

39:13.680 --> 39:15.120
But?

39:15.200 --> 39:16.720
[in Norwegian] I can't.

39:16.800 --> 39:20.240
[in English] I have to go...
to Jonas' school for a meeting.

39:20.320 --> 39:21.640
Yeah? What's wrong?

39:21.720 --> 39:24.440
I don't understand.
He knocked out two teeth...

39:24.520 --> 39:25.840
[in Norwegian] of a friend.

39:25.920 --> 39:28.040
[in English] You don't say.

39:28.120 --> 39:31.640
I don't understand why he has suddenly
started to do such things.

39:31.720 --> 39:34.320
Well, you know, boys will be boys.
[chuckles]

39:34.400 --> 39:36.360
We can go out some other night.
It's all right.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.680
All right, bye-bye.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.840
- Huh?
- Wow.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.720
All right, now get out there and kill 'em!

39:43.800 --> 39:46.040
Get out there, girls!

39:49.800 --> 39:52.720
[pop music playing]

39:57.720 --> 40:01.080
Come on, everybody!
Clap your hands.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.240
Fantastic bar.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.560
Thank you, thank you.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.240
[in Norwegian]
Yes, sir, what can I get you?

40:15.320 --> 40:16.320
Gin and tonic, please.

40:16.400 --> 40:17.760
[in English] Coming right up.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.920
- [in Norwegian] Cool jacket.
- Yeah...

40:29.040 --> 40:31.480
[in English] Ditto.

40:31.560 --> 40:34.960
[singing "Soul Salvation of Love"]

40:35.040 --> 40:38.520
- [Roy in Norwegian] Twenty-five.
- [man 1] I'm in.

40:38.600 --> 40:41.240
[man 2] I fold.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.200
Raise you by 25.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.800
Fifty now.

40:50.440 --> 40:51.520
Arnie...

40:54.640 --> 40:57.080
[in Norwegian]
None of us ordered a taxi.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.760
[in English]
I brought Travis Bickle here for a reason.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.120
He's got something to give you.

41:05.680 --> 41:09.280
Let's just say he's found
the spiritual wisdom in his heart...

41:09.360 --> 41:12.000
to admit when he's wrong.

41:12.080 --> 41:15.120
And it's hard to drive a cab
with ten broken fingers.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.440
[bag unzipping]

41:21.240 --> 41:24.120
[in Norwegian] What the fuck?
This can't be much more than half of--

41:24.200 --> 41:26.320
Until his debt's fully paid,

41:26.400 --> 41:29.960
he's agreed to give all your guys
free transportation.

41:30.040 --> 41:32.360
He's trying to do the right thing.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.600
[in Norwegian] You ought to be grateful
you've got friends

41:38.680 --> 41:40.680
with more between their
ears than you have.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.320
I know.   [clears throat]

41:43.440 --> 41:45.120
[in English] Cheers.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.800
[glasses clink]

41:50.280 --> 41:53.120
["Soul Salvation of Love" continuing]

42:05.840 --> 42:07.920
[crowd cheering]

42:10.400 --> 42:13.280
[Torgeir in Norwegian]
One, two, three, four, five...

42:15.200 --> 42:17.360
[in English] Man, oh, man.

42:17.440 --> 42:18.760
What's the score?

42:18.840 --> 42:20.200
[laughing] Fuck, boss!

42:20.280 --> 42:23.960
[in Norwegian] We pulled in ten big ones
more than you thought.

42:24.040 --> 42:26.160
Join me for a drink
before we call it a night.

42:26.240 --> 42:29.800
[in Norwegian] I'll never really get used
to the shop stuff.

42:29.880 --> 42:33.480
Isn't there any life in that contraption
I set up for you?

42:33.560 --> 42:36.320
Something's cooking down there.
It smells terrible.

42:38.080 --> 42:40.160
[sighs]

42:48.120 --> 42:49.680
[sniffing]

42:57.680 --> 43:00.000
[door opens]

43:00.080 --> 43:01.800
[in English] Yeah, baby.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.200
Vegas is coming to Norway.

43:04.280 --> 43:05.800
That's right, baby.

43:05.880 --> 43:07.320
[hissing]

43:11.800 --> 43:14.400
- [explosion]
- What the fuck was that?

43:18.960 --> 43:20.920
[sirens wailing]

43:24.160 --> 43:27.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's all this?

43:27.320 --> 43:30.640
I didn't call anybody.
Everything's under control, fellas.

43:30.720 --> 43:32.680
[in Norwegian]
Hey, hey, hey!

43:32.760 --> 43:34.760
What on Earth is going on in there?

43:34.840 --> 43:37.480
[in English] Just had a little mishap
with the gas tank. Nothing serious.

43:37.560 --> 43:38.880
Nothing serious?

43:38.960 --> 43:41.040
[in Norwegian] I thought the whole house
would blow to pieces!

43:41.120 --> 43:44.440
[in English] I'm sorry you guys had
to bring out all this shit for no reason.

43:44.520 --> 43:47.800
He's a little something, all right?
Get yourself a new hose.

43:47.880 --> 43:50.240
[in Norwegian] Well, we'd better
just get going then.

43:50.320 --> 43:54.040
But you've got to check this!
Other people live here, too.

43:54.120 --> 43:55.760
[fireman]
But he says that it's--

43:55.840 --> 44:00.200
Just a moment. I am the police chief,
