00:18.460 --> 00:21.210
- -

00:34.830 --> 00:36.620
Help me.

00:39.290 --> 00:40.380
Louise.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.880
Okay. It's okay. Help is on the way.

01:10.250 --> 01:11.710
No!

01:16.670 --> 01:18.040
Dreaming again?

01:18.540 --> 01:20.080
Same one?

01:21.170 --> 01:22.540
Maybe you should see a counselor.

01:22.920 --> 01:24.500
It might help them to stop.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.120
Only one thing is going
to help them to stop.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.670
None of it was your fault. You know that.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.040
Baby, you can't go on like this.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.920
You need your sleep.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.040
I'll be fine.

01:35.170 --> 01:36.710
Yeah, I know.

01:37.460 --> 01:38.670
That's what you keep saying.

01:38.670 --> 01:40.170
Go back to sleep.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.540
No way.

03:21.330 --> 03:22.920
Are you ever going to turn that page?

03:24.080 --> 03:25.750
I haven't finished it yet.

03:26.420 --> 03:28.080
You miss him, huh?

03:30.540 --> 03:32.170
Yeah, me, too.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.670
Me three.

03:36.170 --> 03:37.580
That's not a lot to go on, Emily.

03:37.580 --> 03:39.790
I know.
But it's him. I know it is.

03:39.790 --> 03:41.250
And now he's stateside.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.330
People get shot in New York every day.
What makes you so sure?

03:44.330 --> 03:46.960
Geography, MO, victimology,

03:48.670 --> 03:51.670
Chikatilo in Russia,
Jack the Ripper in London,

03:51.670 --> 03:53.620
last month it was the Boston Strangler.

03:53.620 --> 03:55.790
Now, it was a single homicide,

03:55.790 --> 03:57.540
so I thought maybe that was just me

03:57.540 --> 03:59.330
trying to see
something that wasn't there.

03:59.330 --> 04:02.040
But now he's in New York
copying the Son of Sam.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.750
It's him. I know it's him.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.420
Berkowitz shot two people
in that first Son of Sam murder.

04:06.880 --> 04:07.960
You've only got one victim here.

04:08.330 --> 04:11.330
Yes, but it happened in the same
neighborhood in the Bronx,

04:11.330 --> 04:13.960
and ballistics confirmed
it was a .44 caliber bulldog

04:13.960 --> 04:15.500
exactly like Berkowitz used.

04:15.830 --> 04:19.750
In Boston he used nylon stockings
to strangle an elderly woman

04:19.750 --> 04:24.670
one block from where DeSalvo's
first murder took place back in 1962.

04:24.670 --> 04:26.790
We haven't been invited in
by Boston or NYPD.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.790
And you know the protocol gets tricky.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.290
Technically it's serial.

04:30.290 --> 04:32.000
FBI has jurisdiction.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.040
Well, if you count
the international kills, yes.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.040
But we're gonna have to get
permission from the DOJ.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.580
Good people died
trying to catch this guy, Hotch.

04:41.580 --> 04:42.790
I need your help.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.580
Okay. We're somewhere
over Texas right now.

04:47.580 --> 04:48.580
How soon can you meet us
in New York?

04:50.330 --> 04:51.620
I'm already on my way.

05:31.710 --> 05:35.000
"Originality is nothing
but judicious imitation."

05:35.500 --> 05:36.790
Voltaire.

05:36.790 --> 05:38.830
What makes us so sure
it's all the same guy?

05:38.830 --> 05:42.210
Well, Emily believes it's how precisely
he's mimicking each crime.

05:42.210 --> 05:43.210
Go ahead, Garcia.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.380
Okay. This is all streaming
to your tablets.

05:45.380 --> 05:46.750
Feel free to follow along.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.290
I give you Andrei Chikatilo.

05:48.290 --> 05:51.000
His first victim was in 1978.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.920
It was a 9-year-old girl
whose body was discovered

05:53.920 --> 05:55.500
in the Russian city of Rostov.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.790
She was sexually assaulted,
strangled, and mutilated.

05:58.790 --> 06:02.620
He also took eyeballs as trophies
and ate some of his victims' organs.

06:02.620 --> 06:06.580
Ugh. I now give you
10-year-old Natasha Dudechenko.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.460
Her body was discovered
two years ago,

06:08.460 --> 06:10.670
also in Rostov, roughly a mile away

06:10.670 --> 06:12.250
from where the original
body was found,

06:12.250 --> 06:15.500
and tragically in much
the same condition.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.420
The Russian police apparently
spotted a suspect

06:17.420 --> 06:20.580
near the crime scene, but he eluded
capture in the crowded train station.

06:20.580 --> 06:25.000
Chikatilo actually confessed to 56
murders committed between 1978 and 1990.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.380
Well, the timeline and the body count

06:26.380 --> 06:29.750
probably don't matter as much as
geography and the copying of the MO.

06:29.750 --> 06:30.790
It was the same last year in London.

06:31.420 --> 06:34.880
It was, indeed. Three women were
discovered in Whitechapel,

06:34.880 --> 06:38.460
which is a district in East London,
all within a month,

06:38.460 --> 06:40.460
and all eviscerated Ã  la Mr. Ripper.

06:40.790 --> 06:42.790
The third victim was Scotland Yard.

06:42.790 --> 06:46.040
And that's when Emily almost got him
in that undercover operation.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.710
If this is the same UnSub,
he would be incredibly rare.

06:48.710 --> 06:51.250
He's both criminally
and forensically sophisticated,

06:51.250 --> 06:52.710
and the fact that
he's been able to function

06:52.710 --> 06:54.170
and evade capture in three countries

06:54.170 --> 06:55.500
means that he's highly intelligent

06:55.500 --> 06:56.920
and almost certainly multilingual.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.080
And he's got some money
in his pocket, too.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.960
Travel takes financing.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.670
Lewis is flying in from an assignment
in Atlanta.

07:02.670 --> 07:04.080
And we'll all connect
with Emily in New York.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.500
Well, it'll be good to see her again.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.210
Too bad it's gotta be like this.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.710
NEW YORK

07:19.830 --> 07:22.040
Excuse me, I'm looking
for an Agent Prentiss.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.250
You found her.

07:23.250 --> 07:26.580
Oh, hi. Dr. Tara Lewis.
Really happy to finally meet you.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.880
I've heard great things.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.920
Every bit of it's true. I've been looking
forward to meeting you, too.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.290
I see you got a head start.

07:32.290 --> 07:33.750
Two years' worth.

07:34.460 --> 07:36.250
I heard you almost
got him in London.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.210
I'm... I'm really sorry
about what happened.

07:40.620 --> 07:41.710
Yeah, me, too.

07:41.710 --> 07:43.830
Were you close to the Scotland Yard
inspector that got killed?

07:44.290 --> 07:47.880
No. I mean, I knew her,
of course, but, no.

07:48.420 --> 07:51.210
There she is.
-

07:51.540 --> 07:52.960
-Hi!
-Hi.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.210
We missed you. How are you?

07:55.210 --> 07:57.380
Good. Good.
It's so great to see you guys.

07:57.380 --> 07:59.620
-Oh, brainiac, I love the 'do.
-Hi.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.380
-Thank you for coming.
-Of course.

08:01.670 --> 08:03.380
Rossi and JJ are headed
to the crime scene.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.920
-I'm assuming you want to join?
-You assume right.

08:16.170 --> 08:18.250
You know, I can't believe it.

08:18.500 --> 08:22.080
The whole ride down here,
you didn't mention the guy once.

08:22.580 --> 08:23.750
I'm just saying.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.420
What

08:25.750 --> 08:28.120
Okay, guys, I'm sorry. I was going to.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.830
I was just giving you space.

08:29.830 --> 08:31.500
I mean, he just left.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.250
You must still be raw.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.920
I remember leaving you guys
both times. I was heartbroken.

08:37.540 --> 08:39.250
I'm sure he's gonna be okay.

08:39.620 --> 08:43.540
He's with his family, and he's... Morgan.

08:44.330 --> 08:46.830
How are you guys doing

08:46.830 --> 08:49.170
Yeah. I mean, some days
are better than others.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.380
Actually, I was giving you a hard time

08:51.380 --> 08:53.250
over your boyfriend Mark.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.830
Wait... How do you know about Mark?

08:55.830 --> 08:57.420
Oh, come on, I'll give you one guess.

08:58.460 --> 08:59.920
Garcia.

09:02.420 --> 09:03.540
You must be the Feds.

09:03.540 --> 09:05.120
I'm McLeary. This is Rawlings.

09:05.460 --> 09:06.920
I'm SSA Rossi.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.670
This is Agent Jareau,

09:08.670 --> 09:10.710
Agent Prentiss here is with Interpol.

09:10.710 --> 09:12.250
This is it right over here.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.000
What can you tell us
about the victim?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.380
Her name was Camille Harrison.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.250
26-year-old bartender from Yonkers.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.250
Cause of death was a single gunshot
wound to the head.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.750
There was someone else in here.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.790
See the blood spatter shadow
on the passenger seat?

09:24.170 --> 09:25.580
Yeah, we picked up on that.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.250
Figured the shooter was
standing right here

09:28.250 --> 09:29.920
outside the driver's side window

09:29.920 --> 09:31.420
while Ms Harrison was at the wheel.

09:31.420 --> 09:33.380
You guys find any blood trails?

09:33.380 --> 09:35.620
No. But it rained last night.

09:35.620 --> 09:37.000
It compromised the scene.

09:37.420 --> 09:38.880
If someone else was here,

09:39.120 --> 09:42.040
that matches the MO of the
Son of Sam murders.

09:42.040 --> 09:46.080
Berkowitz's first victims were two girls
he shot in a car.

09:46.380 --> 09:49.710
Yes, but one of them was
only hit in the leg and survived.

09:49.710 --> 09:51.580
But you're assuming
there was a second victim.

09:51.580 --> 09:53.420
We only got one stiff.

09:53.420 --> 09:55.620
Okay, but let's say
somebody else was shot.

09:55.620 --> 09:56.750
What would they do?

09:56.750 --> 09:58.880
- -I'd get the hell out of the car and run.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.210
Yeah. And I'd go this way.

10:01.540 --> 10:03.250
That's where the closest busy street is.

10:05.620 --> 10:08.210
So if I'm hurt, maybe I stumble.

10:12.540 --> 10:14.120
Hello. I've got something here.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.750
Do you have an evidence
collection kit in your car?

10:16.380 --> 10:19.080
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

10:19.380 --> 10:21.540
With obstacles at every turn,

10:21.540 --> 10:24.580
the great Pacific salmon runs on,
upstream,

10:24.580 --> 10:27.620
sometimes even uphill,
but always onward.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.920
With mother nature as his guide,

10:29.920 --> 10:32.330
he adapts from saltwater to fresh

10:32.330 --> 10:34.540
and moves from the oceans
to the rivers

10:34.540 --> 10:37.040
to take the most important
journey of his life...

10:37.330 --> 10:39.000
The return home.

10:39.290 --> 10:43.330
He follows the same route countless
generations before him have,

10:44.290 --> 10:46.580
and this epic voyage culminates

10:46.580 --> 10:49.380
in the very spot where life began.

10:49.620 --> 10:52.920
And then, in what seems
like a cruel twist,

10:52.920 --> 10:55.250
after they spawn, they die.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.670
But there are no endings in
the eternal cycle of life,

10:59.670 --> 11:01.920
only new beginnings.

11:05.500 --> 11:08.790
Oh, buddy, I remember
why I missed you so much now.

11:08.790 --> 11:09.920
Guys, I noticed a pattern.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.750
The UnSub only kills between the
months of March and September.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.500
Makes sense. It's easier to move around

11:14.500 --> 11:16.920
-in the summer months.
-Go ahead, Garcia.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.960
I have got absolutely nothing
on my passport search.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.290
I've been trying to pinpoint travelers

11:21.290 --> 11:23.330
who were in America, the UK,

11:23.330 --> 11:25.380
and Russia at the time of the murders.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.460
I have zero matches.

11:26.460 --> 11:27.880
Hey, we should also look at diplomats.

11:28.380 --> 11:31.080
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it's you, hi!

11:31.080 --> 11:32.170
Hey, you.

11:32.170 --> 11:33.750
Oh, my God! You're here!

11:33.750 --> 11:35.880
You're not here here,
but you're in the country here.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.830
I miss you. How are you?

11:38.210 --> 11:40.170
-Garcia.
-Oh, yes, sorry.

11:40.670 --> 11:42.250
Uh, Diplomats. Explain.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.580
Well, what if he's part of some
kind of diplomatic envoy?

11:44.920 --> 11:46.670
Someone attached
to an embassy would have money

11:46.670 --> 11:48.080
and could travel with ease.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.540
Not to mention diplomatic immunity.

11:49.540 --> 11:50.880
It would also explain
him being multi-lingual.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.880
Still would have to
go through customs, though.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.790
I got a match.

11:54.790 --> 11:56.040
It's not really a match.

11:56.420 --> 11:57.670
Why not?

11:57.670 --> 11:59.290
Because I don't think our UnSub

11:59.290 --> 12:02.250
is his Excellency Dr. Sanjay Shah,

12:02.250 --> 12:05.580
61-year-old Indian ambassador
to the UK.

12:05.580 --> 12:06.960
He was in London at the right time,

12:06.960 --> 12:10.080
but he's currently speaking at a
climate control conference in Miami.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.460
Guys, we got a woman who was
shot in the leg in the Bronx.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.460
Claims she was mugged, but she was
in the area at the right time.

12:20.460 --> 12:21.710
Hi. Monica?

12:22.330 --> 12:24.170
My name's Jennifer. This is Emily.

12:24.170 --> 12:26.670
We're with the FBI. Do you mind if we
ask you a few questions?

12:27.420 --> 12:29.880
FBI? I already talked to the cops.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.420
We'll be quick. Promise.

12:34.290 --> 12:35.920
It's not like I'm going anywhere.

12:36.670 --> 12:39.670
Okay. Can you tell us
how you got shot?

12:39.670 --> 12:41.460
Some white dude mugged me.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.710
Took my purse, my phone.

12:43.710 --> 12:44.920
Shot me in the leg.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.830
I already told the cops all of this.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.670
Can't you just talk to them?

12:49.670 --> 12:51.920
Okay, Monica, look,
I'm gonna keep this 100

12:51.920 --> 12:53.500
because I don't have a lot of time.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.170
Have you ever heard of Interpol?

12:56.380 --> 12:57.670
No.

12:57.670 --> 12:59.790
It's an international police organization.

12:59.790 --> 13:02.290
And I'm talking like 190 countries.

13:02.290 --> 13:04.080
We help cops all over the world.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.540
Wait, but you said you were FBI.

13:06.540 --> 13:09.250
I am. But I'm also attached to Interpol.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.880
And part of my job is to hunt down
serial killers.

13:14.380 --> 13:15.710
-For real?
-For real.

13:16.620 --> 13:17.830
The guy I'm looking for

13:17.830 --> 13:20.000
I have tracked all the way from Russia

13:20.000 --> 13:21.460
to England to here.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.830
So far he's killed
six people that we know of.

13:24.830 --> 13:27.250
The youngest was a 10-year-old girl.

13:27.250 --> 13:30.000
The oldest was
a 72-year-old grandmother.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.460
Oh, my God.

13:33.620 --> 13:35.210
So tell me what really happened to you.

13:39.210 --> 13:43.460
Please... If my father finds out...

13:44.290 --> 13:45.290
He's not here.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Okay? It's just us.

13:48.830 --> 13:50.460
Tell us what really happened.

13:55.750 --> 13:57.080
Uh, we pulled over.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.830
His girlfriend was driving,

13:58.830 --> 14:00.620
he got out of the backseat of the car,

14:00.620 --> 14:02.250
and then I heard this bang.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.540
- -

14:04.790 --> 14:06.830
Her blood was everywhere.

14:06.830 --> 14:08.420
It was all over me.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.670
Okay, okay.
Let's start at the beginning.

14:11.170 --> 14:12.290
How did you meet him?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.210
Um, he...
He texted me from my internet ad.

14:18.580 --> 14:21.880
I escort sometimes, but only
when I really need the money.

14:22.210 --> 14:23.750
Do you remember his name?

14:24.710 --> 14:26.120
Mike.

14:26.120 --> 14:29.080
He was trying to hook up
a threesome with his girlfriend.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.500
I don't do that.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.120
But he said he'd give me 300
just to show up.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.080
I thought he was gonna rob me.

14:41.420 --> 14:43.420
But he just shot me and walked away.

14:44.620 --> 14:46.170
Did he have an accent?

14:46.170 --> 14:48.500
Could you tell where he was from?

14:50.120 --> 14:52.580
No. He was from here.

14:54.210 --> 14:55.210
He was American.

15:01.750 --> 15:04.250
NYPD doubled their patrols in Queens,

15:04.250 --> 15:05.710
where Berkowitz hunted next.

15:06.290 --> 15:07.790
He may not try to hit Queens.

15:07.790 --> 15:10.880
He only copycatted one murder
in Boston before he moved on.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.420
Maybe now that he's
back home in the States,

15:12.420 --> 15:14.000
he's accelerating
for some reason or another.

15:14.290 --> 15:16.500
It might be because we have so many
serial killers to choose from.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.380
So the cell phone he texted
Monica DeJesus with was a burner.

15:19.880 --> 15:23.080
You know, somehow
he managed to talk Camille Harrison

15:23.080 --> 15:24.750
into a threesome with a prostitute.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.540
This guy must be quite the charmer.

15:26.540 --> 15:28.420
You are not kidding.
The amount of germs exchanged

15:28.420 --> 15:30.080
in a situation like that
could be astronomical.

15:30.380 --> 15:32.670
Well, maybe Camille
was into that kind of thing.

15:32.670 --> 15:35.040
Fair enough.
But the UnSub barely knew her.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.380
We would have had calls,
texts, something.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.710
Everyone she was
in touch with checks out.

15:40.710 --> 15:42.830
And he let Monica live.

15:42.830 --> 15:44.880
Copying the MO was
so important to him,

15:44.880 --> 15:46.330
he needed to keep one of them alive.

15:46.330 --> 15:47.830
One of our squads thinks
they spotted someone

15:47.830 --> 15:49.620
that matches your guy's description.

15:49.620 --> 15:51.120
He entered a warehouse in Queens.

16:09.790 --> 16:10.880
Clear.

16:12.790 --> 16:13.790
Clear!

16:17.830 --> 16:18.830
Clear.

16:19.750 --> 16:20.790
Clear.

16:22.330 --> 16:23.330
Clear.

16:24.920 --> 16:25.920
We're clear over here.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.120
Clear.

16:29.540 --> 16:30.540
Clear.

16:32.620 --> 16:33.710
That's the whole building.

16:33.710 --> 16:34.880
He's not here.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.120
Agents, McLeary here.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.620
We found something
about a block over.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.290
Damn it!

16:52.290 --> 16:54.210
We almost had him.

17:09.830 --> 17:13.080
Victims are Trent
and Rhonda Klein, both 46.

17:13.380 --> 17:16.040
Trent was a corporate lawyer,
Rhonda was an ad exec.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.380
Survived by their two daughters.

17:17.880 --> 17:18.880
How old?

17:19.170 --> 17:21.120
12 and 10.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.420
.44 caliber.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.790
But he uses a bulldog revolver.

17:26.790 --> 17:29.830
It doesn't eject shells, and it only holds
five rounds.

17:29.830 --> 17:31.670
Okay, I know we need to wait
for the ME's report,

17:31.670 --> 17:33.500
but I count seven
different entry wounds.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.750
She's got at least six.
So he had to reload twice.

17:37.710 --> 17:39.580
Berkowitz didn't do that.

17:39.580 --> 17:40.960
And he was a misogynist.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.920
The only man he shot
was a guy with long hair

17:43.210 --> 17:44.330
that he thought was a woman.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.000
This UnSub's out of control,
and this is overkill.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.380
So what was it about these two
that made him lose it?

17:49.380 --> 17:52.040
Well, he could be evolving, finally
figuring out what it is he really likes.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.000
What is that?

18:02.040 --> 18:03.040
Hey.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.170
Ugh.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.620
That is a Rolex.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.620
Why so angry all of a sudden?

18:10.620 --> 18:12.420
You know, this is an expensive car.

18:12.420 --> 18:15.830
And those princess-cut diamonds
in her ears are at least a carat each,

18:16.120 --> 18:17.380
but he didn't take any of it.

18:17.380 --> 18:19.330
We profiled he has money.
He doesn't need those things.

18:19.620 --> 18:22.460
Yeah, but these are the first victims
that actually had money.

18:22.460 --> 18:23.580
Look what he did.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.000
He punished them.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.960
So maybe it's some kind
of self-loathing thing.

18:28.540 --> 18:29.960
Or maybe we got it wrong.

18:29.960 --> 18:31.750
I mean, just because the guy's
educated and multi-lingual

18:31.750 --> 18:33.460
doesn't mean he comes from money.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.500
Maybe it's exactly the opposite.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.880
Maybe he hates people with money.

18:39.290 --> 18:40.750
We should deliver the profile.

18:40.750 --> 18:44.250
The man we're looking for is
a narcissistic copycat killer.

18:44.250 --> 18:47.750
Typically, copycats have identity issues
and low confidence,

18:47.750 --> 18:49.210
which is why they emulate others.

18:49.210 --> 18:50.500
But this guy's different.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.120
Confidence is the one thing he's full of.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.710
He is brazenly replicating
high-profile murderers

18:55.710 --> 18:56.750
and he's doing it globally.

18:57.330 --> 18:59.750
He is only active between
March and September,

18:59.750 --> 19:01.210
which means he has to do something

19:01.210 --> 19:03.500
between October and February
to bankroll it all.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.420
Probably a cash business.

19:05.420 --> 19:07.040
That way he doesn't leave a paper trail.

19:07.290 --> 19:08.670
Given his skill set,

19:08.670 --> 19:10.380
we're thinking thief, drug dealer,

19:11.290 --> 19:12.750
maybe even organized crime.

19:12.750 --> 19:13.920
Because we got close to him,

19:13.920 --> 19:15.750
he's probably already on the move.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.330
He's extremely mobile,

19:17.330 --> 19:19.960
so canvass airports, train,
and bus stations.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.880
His fascination with serial crime

19:22.880 --> 19:25.170
is deeply embedded in his psyche
and part of what drives him.

19:25.460 --> 19:29.040
Which means he was probably exposed
to serial crime at a young age.

19:29.330 --> 19:31.880
He may have been a victim,
related to a victim,

19:31.880 --> 19:33.670
or even connected to a perpetrator.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.830
Unfortunately, there's no doubt
he'll strike again.

19:36.120 --> 19:38.580
It's just a matter of who he decides
to copy next.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.000
It's not polite to stare, you know.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.040
Are you bored?

19:59.710 --> 20:00.960
Yeah, me, too.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.420
It's a long ride.

20:06.380 --> 20:08.040
Coming or going?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.620
Going to see my grandpa.

20:10.670 --> 20:11.920
Well, that's good.

20:12.290 --> 20:14.000
Family's important.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.380
Where's your dad?

20:19.830 --> 20:22.580
I only stay at his house
some weekends.

20:38.210 --> 20:40.120
What is it?

20:40.120 --> 20:41.500
It's a bullet.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.120
That one's lucky.

20:44.250 --> 20:45.750
Want to know why?

20:48.380 --> 20:50.920
Because it doesn't
have your name on it.

21:04.460 --> 21:06.880
Yeah, I've had that dream
many times myself.

21:07.170 --> 21:09.580
Bullets just bounce right off of him.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.880
I keep firing and he keeps coming.

21:13.790 --> 21:16.380
I always wake up
right before he grabs me.

21:17.580 --> 21:20.120
I'm literally losing sleep here.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.960
Some cases just stick with you.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.830
Makes sense that this one's important.

21:25.290 --> 21:28.830
I just wish I can flip a switch
or something to control it.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.380
The only way to control it
is to surrender to it.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.920
If I do that, then I have to face the fact

21:33.920 --> 21:35.290
that I might never catch this guy.

21:35.290 --> 21:37.120
Yeah, but by that logic,

21:37.120 --> 21:39.290
you also have to face
the fact that you might.

21:40.420 --> 21:42.540
One thing you can't do is
blame yourself.

21:43.250 --> 21:44.250
For any of it.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.330
Yeah.

21:46.330 --> 21:47.880
Easier said than done, you know?

21:48.540 --> 21:50.500
Tell me about it.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.040
Guys.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.670
I found something.

21:54.620 --> 21:56.790
If the UnSub has moved on,

21:56.790 --> 21:58.920
I was trying to discern
where he might go.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.330
Based on the time of death
of his most recent victims,

22:01.330 --> 22:02.620
I was able to estimate
just how far he could get.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.040
Now, if he's somehow managed to get
on an airplane, however,

22:05.040 --> 22:06.380
he could be anywhere
in the world right now.

22:06.830 --> 22:09.790
Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark
are heavily covered.

22:09.790 --> 22:11.250
It'd be hard to get through that net.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.580
Exactly. So his most
likely mode of transport

22:13.580 --> 22:15.330
would be a train, a bus, or a car.

22:15.580 --> 22:18.620
I looked at departure schedules,
I factored in possible travel speeds,

22:18.620 --> 22:21.330
and it appears to me he could not have
gotten past this.

22:21.710 --> 22:23.750
That's a lot of real estate to cover.

22:23.750 --> 22:25.250
What's the deal with these?

22:25.250 --> 22:27.170
Each of these represents
the most famous killers

22:27.170 --> 22:28.330
of the past 150 years.

22:28.830 --> 22:30.880
Wow, look at Chicago.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.790
I went as far back as the 1890s
with H.H. Holmes,

22:33.790 --> 22:36.380
then the Lipstick Killer in
the 1940s, William Heirens.

22:36.380 --> 22:37.670
We of course also have to
consider Al Capone

22:37.670 --> 22:39.500
and the St. Valentine's Day Massacre

22:39.500 --> 22:41.040
and Richard Speck and
John Wayne Gacy.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.500
I'm assuming that's
Jeffrey Dahmer nearby in Milwaukee?

22:43.500 --> 22:45.670
Yes. And this is Ed Gein.

22:45.670 --> 22:47.830
Well, if you wanted to copycat
a famous serial killer, it looks like

22:48.330 --> 22:50.790
Chicago would be the place to be.

23:03.210 --> 23:05.750
Welcome to Chicago.
If you have any luggage,

23:05.750 --> 23:07.830
please line up on the right side
of the bus.

23:09.420 --> 23:11.380
Get your stuff together,
baby, we're here.

23:29.620 --> 23:31.000
Got to go to the bathroom?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.380
No.

23:59.080 --> 24:00.380
JJ...

24:00.880 --> 24:02.670
Help me. Help me.

24:04.670 --> 24:05.670
Hey.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.580
No, JJ, no.

24:09.880 --> 24:11.210
No, no, no, no, no, JJ.

24:11.210 --> 24:12.250
Just hang on.

24:12.540 --> 24:14.080
Help is coming. Please, hang in there.

24:15.670 --> 24:17.120
Emily...

24:51.210 --> 24:52.920
You had him, Emily.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.710
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.670
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.290
Emily. Emily.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.170
Emily.

25:01.170 --> 25:02.210
Emily.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.170
Emily!

25:07.540 --> 25:08.830
I'm up.

25:09.380 --> 25:11.000
I'm up.

25:13.790 --> 25:15.210
Why are you guys all staring?

25:15.540 --> 25:17.620
You were dreaming. The same one?

25:19.670 --> 25:21.540
Yeah.

25:21.830 --> 25:23.460
Only JJ was in it this time.

25:32.380 --> 25:33.830
Tara, remember when you asked me

25:33.830 --> 25:35.500
if I was close to the inspector
who was killed?

25:35.790 --> 25:37.210
Yeah.

25:37.210 --> 25:38.750
I lied.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.120
Her name was Louise Hulland,

25:42.710 --> 25:46.080
and I was the one who suggested
she volunteer to go undercover.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.620
I told her it would be
good for her career.

25:49.920 --> 25:53.580
And we needed more women
in power positions.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.380
Emily, it's... It's okay.

25:55.670 --> 25:57.710
But it was my profile.

25:58.710 --> 26:00.960
The whole operation, it was my idea.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.960
You never told us that.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.960
Well, I'm telling you now.

26:07.580 --> 26:08.960
She's dead because of me.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.290
Emily,

26:11.290 --> 26:13.500
she volunteered.
You have to remember that.

26:13.500 --> 26:16.170
But I talked her into it.

26:16.170 --> 26:18.620
The Chief Inspector hated the idea.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.750
He thought it was too risky.

26:22.250 --> 26:25.620
And I went above his head
to push it through.

26:28.170 --> 26:32.540
I just... I thought we'd catch him.

26:33.830 --> 26:35.250
You almost did.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.380
Almost.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.710
Excuse me, but can you please tell me

27:01.710 --> 27:03.210
where Mason Hall is?

27:03.750 --> 27:04.960
You're looking at it.

27:05.250 --> 27:07.170
You're kidding.

27:07.170 --> 27:08.750
I must have walked by it three times.

27:08.750 --> 27:10.000
-Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.290
I'm Mike.

27:11.790 --> 27:12.960
Megan.

27:13.460 --> 27:15.330
Congratulations.

27:15.830 --> 27:18.000
You are officially
the first student I've met.

27:18.460 --> 27:20.380
New professor. My first day.

27:21.830 --> 27:23.080
Nice watch.

27:23.080 --> 27:24.380
Thanks.

27:24.380 --> 27:27.210
Oh, you know Mason Hall
is a girls' dorm, right?

27:27.210 --> 27:30.000
Yeah. I'm supposed to meet
one of my teaching assistants.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.580
Just making sure you didn't
mean Mason Science Building.

27:31.580 --> 27:33.750
Totally different.

27:33.750 --> 27:36.540
There's actually a Mason
Athletic Center, too, right?

27:36.830 --> 27:38.120
There is.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.790
Yeah. Guess that Mason family

27:39.790 --> 27:41.330
must have had
a little bit of money, huh?

27:43.170 --> 27:44.960
Thanks again, Megan.
Enjoy the rest of your day.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.380
You, too.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.460
Don't give me that look. I'm fine.

28:05.460 --> 28:07.290
Oh, I know.

28:07.540 --> 28:10.460
But... I can also tell
you're holding something back,

28:10.460 --> 28:12.500
because you don't want us
to think you're crazy.

28:13.080 --> 28:16.500
Emily, we already think you're crazy.

28:16.500 --> 28:17.960
Thank you.

28:18.460 --> 28:20.290
Come on, what's going on in there?

28:20.290 --> 28:21.830
Well, that night in London,

28:21.830 --> 28:26.000
he had me and he just walked away
and let me live.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
You weren't part of his plan.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
His need to copy specific aspects
of the murders was compulsive.

28:31.290 --> 28:33.670
I thought that, too. And...

28:33.670 --> 28:35.580
Maybe it's just the nightmare talking,

28:35.580 --> 28:38.750
but I could swear he was savoring it.

28:40.830 --> 28:42.620
Well, a close call like that.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.580
It's gotta be a rush.

28:47.330 --> 28:51.170
Maybe all those near misses
weren't an accident.

28:51.170 --> 28:52.500
He might like it when we're close.

28:52.790 --> 28:54.620
So he's a thrill killer.

28:54.620 --> 28:55.920
Maybe he gets off on the adrenaline.

28:56.540 --> 28:58.790
What have you got, Garcia?

28:58.790 --> 29:01.540
Sir, I connected
to law enforcement surveillance feeds

29:01.540 --> 29:05.080
nationwide, and I used our sketch
to start official recognition search.

29:05.080 --> 29:07.620
I got this, which is streaming
to your tablets now.

29:07.620 --> 29:10.040
It was taken two hours ago
by a Chicago PD camera

29:10.040 --> 29:11.120
outside a bus station.

29:11.420 --> 29:13.500
30 last night.

29:13.500 --> 29:14.830
00 this morning.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.750
So, I am running a search
with the new image.

29:18.040 --> 29:20.420
It's a national database.
It's gonna take a while.

29:20.710 --> 29:22.500
Garcia, let's narrow
the search by region.

29:22.500 --> 29:24.170
It's likely that this UnSub grew up

29:24.170 --> 29:25.620
in an area near
a high-profile serial murder,

29:25.620 --> 29:28.170
so let's concentrate on California,
Illinois, and surrounding states.

29:28.170 --> 29:29.710
Copy that. That helps.

29:29.710 --> 29:33.330
But this program is literally cycling
through millions of faces.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.620
Okay, so what...
What are we missing here?

29:38.620 --> 29:40.040
Well, you said he was savoring it.

29:40.330 --> 29:42.290
So what if this really
is all about the thrill?

29:43.040 --> 29:45.540
It would be hard for a guy like that to
just shut off over the winter,

29:45.540 --> 29:48.960
so what is he doing during
his down time to feed that urge?

29:49.460 --> 29:50.920
Well, we profiled something criminal.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.750
Well, if he was a drug dealer or a thief,

29:53.040 --> 29:54.540
don't you think he would have stolen
that Rolex

29:54.790 --> 29:56.330
instead of shoving it down
that guy's throat?

29:56.330 --> 29:59.580
Okay, then there would be seasonal
and lucrative and probably high risk.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.250
He could be some kind of
hunting or adventure guide.

30:01.250 --> 30:03.420
Maybe on mountain climbing
expeditions or at ski resorts?

30:03.420 --> 30:04.830
Okay. Narrowing the search.

30:04.830 --> 30:06.000
Could be an oil rig worker.

30:06.380 --> 30:08.790
I'm pretty sure they sign
short-term contracts.

30:08.790 --> 30:10.380
Got it.

30:10.380 --> 30:11.670
Wait a minute. The knife.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.170
What knife?

30:13.170 --> 30:15.620
The UnSub's knife in the nightmare.

30:15.620 --> 30:17.420
It's long and serrated on one edge,

30:18.620 --> 30:21.120
and it has a leather lanyard thing
wrapped around his wrist.

30:23.750 --> 30:25.710
That sounds like a fisherman's knife.

30:25.710 --> 30:27.500
Exactly. This might be a stretch,

30:27.500 --> 30:29.170
but what if he's a fisherman?

30:29.170 --> 30:31.620
Crab season is from
October to February.

30:31.620 --> 30:33.670
And it's highly lucrative, considering
you only work a few months a year.

30:33.670 --> 30:35.920
Yeah. And it's also dangerous.
Perfect for a thrill seeker.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.080
Got it, got it, got it, got it. All right.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.330
Technology's working.

30:40.330 --> 30:42.210
Good things come to those who wait.

30:42.210 --> 30:44.670
Don't look at toast while it's cooking.
That sort of thing.

30:46.750 --> 30:49.620
Shut the front door.

30:49.620 --> 30:52.040
I give you 35-year-old
Michael Lee Peterson

30:52.290 --> 30:53.830
of Joliet, Illinois.

30:53.830 --> 30:55.500
He's back in his hometown.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.670
That could mean this is his endgame.

30:56.670 --> 30:57.830
Tell us everything, Garcia.

30:57.830 --> 30:59.580
Mr. Peterson works as a deck hand

30:59.830 --> 31:03.170
on a crab fishing vessel in the Bering
Sea known as Neptune's Squall.

31:03.170 --> 31:05.790
He was raised by his mother Lorraine.
She died of a stroke 10 years ago.

31:05.790 --> 31:08.460
His father Vincent was an armed
robber. He died two years ago.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.000
That was right around the time of those
first murders in Russia.

31:11.290 --> 31:12.580
That could have been the trigger.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.330
Garcia, where'd the father
serve his time?

31:14.330 --> 31:16.830
Uh, mostly Stateville Penitentiary.

31:16.830 --> 31:18.880
Richard Speck and John Wayne Gacy
were both incarcerated there.

31:19.170 --> 31:21.080
So which one is he planning
to copycat?

31:21.080 --> 31:24.080
Well, Speck systematically raped
and murdered eight student nurses

31:24.080 --> 31:25.710
in their dormitory in a single night.

31:25.710 --> 31:28.120
If he's a serial killer looking
for a thrill, that would do the trick.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.960
Garcia, coordinate with the Chicago
field office

31:30.250 --> 31:31.380
and put out an APB for Peterson.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.670
All over it, sir. All over it.

31:46.290 --> 31:49.040
Oh, my God!

31:49.710 --> 31:51.170
You scared the crap out of me!

31:51.420 --> 31:52.920
Yeah, well, maybe
you should close your door

31:52.920 --> 31:54.540
so people can't sneak in.

31:54.540 --> 31:55.710
I was waiting for you.

31:55.960 --> 31:57.620
I guess you didn't see this tweet.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.080
I see a lot of tweets.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.540
From the school?

32:00.540 --> 32:02.210
About the serial killer?

32:02.670 --> 32:04.500
- What?
-Yeah.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.120
The FBI put out a warning.

32:06.120 --> 32:08.420
Probably another kook
with an assault rifle.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.120
There's a picture of the guy.

32:10.120 --> 32:13.790
They want us to stay inside
and travel in groups.

32:15.420 --> 32:16.620
Oh, my God.

32:16.620 --> 32:18.040
I know, right?

32:18.040 --> 32:19.040
No, I saw him today.

32:20.330 --> 32:21.790
-Shut up.
-No, right outside.

32:22.790 --> 32:24.670
He told me he was a new teacher.

32:24.920 --> 32:26.000
Wait, seriously?

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
I swear.

32:27.290 --> 32:29.170
I'm not kidding. I swear.

32:29.170 --> 32:31.210
Um, here, uh,

32:31.460 --> 32:34.880
there's a number it says to call.

32:35.420 --> 32:36.710
You sure?

32:38.540 --> 32:41.170
Here. You should talk.

32:47.620 --> 32:48.790
FBI hotline.

32:48.790 --> 32:49.790
Hello?

32:50.080 --> 32:52.080
I think I saw the man
that you're looking for.

32:52.380 --> 32:53.500
What's your name?

32:53.500 --> 32:55.960
Megan. Megan Ross.

32:56.420 --> 32:58.580
-Where are you?-I'm a student at Northeast State.

33:00.460 --> 33:01.710
Put the phone down, Megan.

33:01.710 --> 33:03.120
-Now.-Are you there?

33:08.620 --> 33:10.120
Given his recent shift in MO,

33:10.120 --> 33:12.380
there's a chance that Peterson
may not copy every aspect

33:12.380 --> 33:13.500
of Speck's murders.

33:13.790 --> 33:14.880
You know, you're right.
He could actually

33:14.880 --> 33:16.750
start selecting affluent targets.

33:16.750 --> 33:18.330
Speck hit a nursing home
on the South Side.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.540
Most of the money in Chicago
is on the North Side.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.500
- -What have you got, Garcia?

33:23.040 --> 33:24.960
Sir, I got a hold of
Stateville visitor logs

33:24.960 --> 33:27.960
and it looks like Peterson and his mom
visited every weekend,

33:27.960 --> 33:30.500
until his dad was transferred
for his own safety.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.620
So Peterson may have even seen
Speck when he was a kid.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.920
Wait. Garcia, for his own safety

33:36.380 --> 33:37.460
Uh, let's see. It looks like

33:37.460 --> 33:40.790
Peterson's dad agreed to testify
against his former partner

33:41.420 --> 33:42.830
and he was almost stabbed to death.

33:43.380 --> 33:46.460
Well, in prison, snitches are worse off
than child molesters.

33:46.460 --> 33:47.710
Serial killers, on the other hand,

33:47.710 --> 33:49.330
top of the food chain.

33:49.330 --> 33:50.670
Kids are like sponges.

33:50.670 --> 33:52.000
He spent a lot of time visiting.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.960
Peterson probably
witnessed that dynamic.

33:54.250 --> 33:57.290
Which would obviously contribute to his
idolization of high-profile killers.

33:57.290 --> 33:59.120
He wants the respect
that his father never got.

33:59.460 --> 34:01.790
And he was kicked out of four schools,
all for fighting.

34:04.750 --> 34:07.120
Guys, we just got a call on the hotline.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.210
It was a hang-up so it could be a prank,

34:09.210 --> 34:12.000
but apparently a student at Northeast
State University spotted Peterson.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.040
Send the location.

34:21.670 --> 34:22.670
Hey, what's up?

34:26.080 --> 34:27.290
You okay?

34:29.290 --> 34:30.380
Megan?

34:31.120 --> 34:33.170
-If you scream, she dies.
-

34:43.920 --> 34:46.580
Agents! SWAT's 10 minutes out
and we got more backup en route.

34:46.880 --> 34:47.960
We need all the exits covered.

34:48.250 --> 34:49.380
-You got it.
-

34:49.750 --> 34:51.710
-Shots fired!
-We can't wait!

34:51.710 --> 34:53.080
All right, we're going in.
Tell SWAT we're going in.

34:53.380 --> 34:54.960
Dave, you take the front,
we'll take the back.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.540
Who's next?

35:38.540 --> 35:39.920
-You?
-

35:42.170 --> 35:43.250
You.

35:43.250 --> 35:45.750
Decisions. Decisions.

35:46.250 --> 35:48.080
Get back in your room and stay there!

35:49.750 --> 35:51.620
-You win.
-No!

35:51.620 --> 35:53.040
Rich girl.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.540
No! No!

35:55.330 --> 35:56.960
Let her go!

35:56.960 --> 35:58.750
-Let her go!
-

36:15.750 --> 36:18.620
Help us! Please! He's gonna kill her!

36:20.250 --> 36:21.670
-It's okay.
-Please.

36:24.040 --> 36:26.000
Whoa!

36:26.000 --> 36:27.380
Michael Lee Peterson, FBI.

36:27.380 --> 36:29.460
Get back. I swear to God
I'll blow her head off.

36:29.460 --> 36:31.250
Okay, okay. It's all good.

36:31.540 --> 36:32.830
Back up!

36:32.830 --> 36:34.670
Sorry, I can't do that.

36:34.670 --> 36:35.960
-Please!
-Shut up!

36:35.960 --> 36:37.170
Shut up.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.710
You don't remember me,
do you, Michael?

36:42.960 --> 36:44.170
We met in London.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.830
You followed me all the way here.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.080
I must be a big deal.

36:51.380 --> 36:54.000
You're already going to be
the man when you get to prison.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.580
00.

37:01.170 --> 37:02.250
Look outside.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.670
Half the cops in the city
are out there just for you.

37:09.380 --> 37:10.880
Go ahead, see for yourself.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.250
You're the best ever.

37:14.250 --> 37:16.500
Police all over the world
have been looking for you.

37:17.830 --> 37:19.380
They're gonna write books about me.

37:21.460 --> 37:23.620
I'm even gonna make you famous.

37:25.170 --> 37:26.290
Look outside.

37:26.580 --> 37:27.830
See all those people out there?

37:28.330 --> 37:30.250
Ha! They're all gonna know my...

37:31.580 --> 37:32.880
- -

38:31.540 --> 38:34.290
Yo, baby girl, what you think
you doing in my office?

38:35.750 --> 38:38.000
You know better than to mess
with my stuff.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.120
I don't mess with your stuff.

38:40.080 --> 38:43.120
You're here, here, here with me.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.830
I didn't think you were gonna be here.

38:44.830 --> 38:47.790
I thought you were gonna go
right home.

38:47.790 --> 38:50.500
Well, I wouldn't hop the pond
without seeing you.

38:50.500 --> 38:52.620
You landed! When did you guys land?

38:52.620 --> 38:54.210
No one tells me anything in this house.

38:54.210 --> 38:55.710
I wanted it to be a surprise.

38:55.710 --> 38:57.460
-Well, it worked.
-

38:58.000 --> 38:59.580
How's my man Sergio?

38:59.880 --> 39:02.290
Oh, my God, he's so good.
He's so good.

39:02.580 --> 39:04.960
He is not old, although he does have
some gray whiskers.

39:05.250 --> 39:06.330
Do you want to see?

39:06.620 --> 39:08.250
-Yes.
-Oh, my gosh.

39:09.750 --> 39:11.170
Come on.

39:11.170 --> 39:13.120
-Aw...
-Very distinguished.

39:16.210 --> 39:17.250
How are you doing?

39:19.670 --> 39:20.750
Uh, I'm okay.

39:22.750 --> 39:26.330
You know what?
I bet it is probably still here.

39:26.330 --> 39:27.460
What?

39:27.460 --> 39:29.080
What is still where?

39:32.380 --> 39:34.080
This.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.500
I had to give it to him
when I lost that bet.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.040
Oh, the Halloween bet.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.250
That was not a good look.

39:40.250 --> 39:41.790
No, it was not.

39:41.790 --> 39:43.210
Mmm-mmm.

39:43.210 --> 39:45.540
Um, isn't it against regulations
to drink in here?

39:46.380 --> 39:48.750
Well, it's a special occasion.
It calls for a drink.

39:48.750 --> 39:51.170
What are they gonna do,
send me back to London?

39:51.170 --> 39:52.380
Right.

39:53.790 --> 39:54.790
To Morgan.

39:56.620 --> 39:57.880
To all the delicious friends.

40:03.830 --> 40:05.710
Ooh... Ha...

40:05.710 --> 40:07.670
You have dinner plans?

40:07.670 --> 40:09.540
Uh, yeah, I do.

40:10.710 --> 40:11.830
With you!

40:13.460 --> 40:15.580
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

40:16.290 --> 40:18.380
You guys are having a party
and you didn't invite me?

40:18.380 --> 40:19.880
You want to come to dinner with us?

40:19.880 --> 40:21.790
Um, yeah. Yeah. I'll let Will know.

40:21.790 --> 40:23.580
Oh, my God.
We're gonna have a girls' night.

40:23.580 --> 40:24.710
Did somebody say girls' night?

40:25.000 --> 40:26.920
Yes, but we'll make
an exception for you.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.000
Me, too?

40:28.000 --> 40:29.330
Not a chance.

40:29.330 --> 40:30.670
I'm kidding.

40:30.670 --> 40:32.880
Well, let's do it.
I'm starving and I'm buying.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.330
And bring the bottle.

40:34.330 --> 40:36.170
Oh, my God. This is...

40:36.170 --> 40:38.290
This is... This is the best.

40:39.830 --> 40:42.790
Okay, so, Hotch and Lewis
are debriefing,

40:42.790 --> 40:44.420
but I'll text them and tell them
where to meet us.

40:44.420 --> 40:45.460
Where are we going?

40:45.710 --> 40:46.880
Mexican?

40:46.880 --> 40:48.540
Burritos in London no bueno.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.330
-Speak of the devil.
-Hey.

40:50.330 --> 40:51.500
Oh, I see tequila.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.830
We're having family dinner. Are you in?

40:53.830 --> 40:55.830
-I've got some time.
-You had me at tequila.

40:55.830 --> 40:56.920
Yes! VÃ¡monos!

40:57.210 --> 40:58.420
This is happening.

40:58.420 --> 41:00.000
You can tell us everything about Mark.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.790
By everything, I mean
everything about Mark.

41:01.790 --> 41:03.120
I want all the details.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.750
I, however, do not.

41:04.750 --> 41:06.290
- -Well, you won't get any.

41:06.290 --> 41:08.080
I'll save that for a real girls' night.

41:08.080 --> 41:11.460
-Oh, yeah, girl.
-Girls' night. Oh, yes. Bring it in.

41:11.460 --> 41:14.000
We'll get a festive place.

41:16.170 --> 41:17.170
Tequila!

42:01.040 --> 42:03.580
"Walking with
a friend in the dark

42:03.580 --> 42:06.460
"is better than walking
alone in the light."

42:06.460 --> 42:08.170
Helen Keller.
