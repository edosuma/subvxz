WEBVTT

00:02.531 --> 00:03.531
It's been a year

00:03.531 --> 00:04.698
Since Chef Gordon Ramsay

00:04.698 --> 00:05.998
traveled cross-country

00:05.998 --> 00:07.498
trying to save restaurants

00:07.498 --> 00:08.764
on the verge
of collapse.

00:08.764 --> 00:10.731
I'm gonna be pissed off!

00:10.731 --> 00:12.198
It's well-done,
Sam.

00:12.198 --> 00:14.831
But not only did Gordon have

00:14.831 --> 00:17.031
to get rid of disgusting food,

00:17.031 --> 00:19.031
he had to repair families

00:19.031 --> 00:20.198
who were at the breaking point.

00:20.198 --> 00:22.098
I've been
doing that

00:22.098 --> 00:23.331
Since I was  13
next to you.

00:23.331 --> 00:24.764
You don't see me?

00:24.764 --> 00:26.031
I took them out.
I'm not putting 'em back.

00:26.031 --> 00:27.498
Don't argue about everything!

00:27.498 --> 00:28.931
Now Gordon is back

00:28.931 --> 00:30.000
to ask the questions

00:30.000 --> 00:30.698
to ask the questions

00:30.698 --> 00:32.531
we've been waiting a year
to get the answers to.

00:32.531 --> 00:34.064
Let's take it from the top.
What happened after I left?

00:36.031 --> 00:38.264
Business, from this time
a year ago, where are we?

00:38.264 --> 00:40.598
Is there anything
you wanted to say to me now

00:40.598 --> 00:42.998
that you didn't get a chance
to say last year?

00:42.998 --> 00:45.198
Tonight, you will see
emotional reunions

00:45.198 --> 00:47.064
as Gordon finds out
what happened

00:47.064 --> 00:48.998
to the restaurants and the
families he tried to save.

00:51.198 --> 00:53.598
There's Giuseppi's
in Detroit.

00:53.598 --> 00:55.064
Why don't we ever have towels
in this line?

00:55.064 --> 00:56.998
There's a towel
right there.

00:56.998 --> 00:58.664
I wouldn't even wipe my ass
with that.

00:58.664 --> 01:00.000
Joe, at war with his son Sam.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.231
Joe, at war with his son Sam.

01:00.231 --> 01:01.664
Mom caught in the crossfire.

01:01.664 --> 01:03.164
How many times

01:03.164 --> 01:04.264
You looked at me
and said, "Hey,

01:04.264 --> 01:06.498
holy  good job"?

01:06.498 --> 01:07.998
Not once.

01:07.998 --> 01:09.364
There's Sante La Brea

01:09.364 --> 01:10.898
in Hollywood.
What?

01:10.898 --> 01:13.064
I'm keep in mind
what is said,!

01:13.064 --> 01:13.998
Good-bye!

01:13.998 --> 01:15.264
The owner Dean

01:15.264 --> 01:17.031
on the verge of a breakdown.

01:17.031 --> 01:19.998
Taking it out
on his two sons.

01:19.998 --> 01:21.831
Even if I'm  wrong,
do it.

01:21.831 --> 01:24.064
Tonight, we'll see who saved

01:24.064 --> 01:25.764
Their family restaurant,

01:25.764 --> 01:29.698
and who turned their kitchens
back into nightmares.

01:29.698 --> 01:30.000
I'm ready
to rock and roll.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.864
I'm ready
to rock and roll.

01:49.931 --> 01:51.331
Last year, Gordon tried

01:51.331 --> 01:52.931
to turn around restaurants

01:52.931 --> 01:54.364
across the country.

01:54.364 --> 01:57.064
In a moment, you'll see
how they're doing today.

01:57.064 --> 01:59.098
But first, a look back

01:59.098 --> 02:00.000
at what Sante La Brea
was like just a year ago.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.498
at what Sante La Brea
was like just a year ago.

02:02.498 --> 02:04.564
Located in the heart
of Hollywood,

02:04.564 --> 02:08.864
Sante La Brea felt like a good,
old-fashioned situation comedy.

02:08.864 --> 02:12.431
There was the wacky owner Dean,

02:12.431 --> 02:13.898
his two sons Sammy and Arthur,

02:13.898 --> 02:16.098
who think Dad
has completely lost it.

02:16.098 --> 02:17.564
I took 'em out.
I'm not putting 'em back.

02:17.564 --> 02:20.364
, even if I'm
wrong,

02:20.364 --> 02:22.064
Do it.

02:22.064 --> 02:24.064
There's Mark,
the general manager

02:24.064 --> 02:25.864
with an embarrassing problem.

02:25.864 --> 02:27.264
I don't like wearing deodorant.

02:27.264 --> 02:29.931
What can I tell you?
Ugh.

02:29.931 --> 02:30.000
And lastly,
there's the grumpy Chef Aurelio.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.198
And lastly,
there's the grumpy Chef Aurelio.

02:33.198 --> 02:34.431
I can do whatever I want here,
so...

02:36.031 --> 02:37.331
What the?

02:37.331 --> 02:39.664
But Sante La Brea

02:39.664 --> 02:41.164
was no laughing matter
as this restaurant

02:41.164 --> 02:43.064
was failing miserably.

02:43.064 --> 02:44.198
What's the problems
with the restaurant?

02:44.198 --> 02:45.431
Straight off,
what is it?

02:45.431 --> 02:46.598
Everyone takes advantage
of me.

02:46.598 --> 02:48.198
I'm not really making money.

02:48.198 --> 02:49.898
I'm actually spending money
for last year.

02:49.898 --> 02:51.931
When it came time

02:51.931 --> 02:53.698
for a healthy Sante La Brea
lunch, Gordon was horrified.

02:53.698 --> 02:57.064
This restaurant prides itself
on being healthy.

02:57.064 --> 02:58.498
That does not look healthy.

02:58.498 --> 03:00.000
And they are disgusting.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.264
And they are disgusting.

03:00.264 --> 03:03.364
There you go, buddy.

03:03.364 --> 03:05.031
Uh, this here
is a mobudofu.

03:05.031 --> 03:07.064
And then came the dish

03:07.064 --> 03:08.164
which Gordon would
forever identify

03:08.164 --> 03:09.164
with Sante La Brea.

03:09.164 --> 03:10.998
This is a joke.

03:10.998 --> 03:13.164
Didn't know mobudofu means
in Chinese.

03:13.164 --> 03:14.331
That's for sure.

03:14.331 --> 03:15.898
How was it?

03:15.898 --> 03:17.831
Just in terms
of the presentation,

03:17.831 --> 03:20.731
it looked like a dog's dinner.

03:20.731 --> 03:22.998
Mm.
Then you get to taste it.

03:22.998 --> 03:24.231
It's hideous.

03:24.231 --> 03:26.531
So...

03:26.531 --> 03:27.831
Oh, God.

03:29.731 --> 03:30.000
Oh.
Not that bad.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.198
Oh.
Not that bad.

03:31.198 --> 03:32.731
Show me
where the salmon is.

03:32.731 --> 03:34.064
It was smelling fishy.

03:34.064 --> 03:36.231
Dean was clearly in denial.

03:36.231 --> 03:38.198
But the one thing
he couldn't deny

03:38.198 --> 03:40.431
was what Gordon found
on an inspection

03:40.431 --> 03:42.398
of his kitchen.
it's rotten.

03:42.398 --> 03:45.898
Your food is about as healthy
as these vegetables.

03:45.898 --> 03:46.998
When I smell , eh,

03:46.998 --> 03:48.998
I go straight
for the  jugular.

03:48.998 --> 03:50.531
There's nothing

03:50.531 --> 03:51.998
for me to say.

03:51.998 --> 03:55.164
The biggest problem
in this restaurant is you.

03:55.164 --> 03:57.398
Congratulations.

03:57.398 --> 03:58.998
It's a  disgrace.

04:02.864 --> 04:04.698
Clearly, Sante La Brea

04:04.698 --> 04:06.264
had many problems,
but the one thing

04:06.264 --> 04:08.098
Dean had going for him

04:08.098 --> 04:09.598
was his two devoted sons.

04:09.598 --> 04:11.198
I see the tears forming, Dad.

04:11.198 --> 04:13.031
I really want to cry.

04:13.031 --> 04:14.931
Give me a hug, man.
Show me some love.

04:14.931 --> 04:18.831
Let's see
some fatherly loving.

04:18.831 --> 04:21.831
Same to you.

04:24.231 --> 04:27.398
As customers came in
for dinner that night,

04:27.398 --> 04:30.000
Aurelio was in the kitchen
doing what he normally did.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.098
Aurelio was in the kitchen
doing what he normally did.

04:30.098 --> 04:31.998
Ignoring Dean.

04:31.998 --> 04:33.031
Just listen to me.

04:33.031 --> 04:34.031
Okay, go to the back.
Don't stay here.

04:34.031 --> 04:35.731
I want to stay here,

04:35.731 --> 04:36.831
and you're gonna do
what I'm asking.

04:36.831 --> 04:37.998
Just do it.
Go to the back.

04:37.998 --> 04:39.531
No, listen, Aurelio.

04:39.531 --> 04:41.398
As for the customers,

04:41.398 --> 04:43.164
They weren't very happy
with what Aurelio

04:43.164 --> 04:45.164
was doing either.
that's not good.

04:45.164 --> 04:46.564
Yeah, we're not very happy
with this.

04:46.564 --> 04:47.564
No, right.

04:47.564 --> 04:48.998
It's just very bland.

04:48.998 --> 04:50.064
Minutes later,

04:50.064 --> 04:51.231
Chef Ramsay unveiled

04:51.231 --> 04:53.064
another shocking discovery.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.198
And what is that?

04:56.198 --> 04:57.264
Fake duck.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.164
Fake duck.

05:00.898 --> 05:04.998
After the last
unhappy customers left,

05:04.998 --> 05:06.198
there was one important matter

05:06.198 --> 05:08.564
that Chef Ramsay had
to deal with right away.

05:08.564 --> 05:11.098
If a health inspector
had witnessed what I witnessed

05:11.098 --> 05:13.031
just in one
of the fridges,

05:13.031 --> 05:14.998
bang. game over.

05:14.998 --> 05:17.998
Clean this  pig sty.

05:17.998 --> 05:21.164
This place does not deserve
an "A."

05:21.164 --> 05:23.864
And the only thing
you're getting from me tonight

05:23.864 --> 05:25.898
is that, an "F."

05:28.164 --> 05:29.931
There.
It's staying on.

05:29.931 --> 05:30.000
Now move your asses.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.564
Now move your asses.

05:31.564 --> 05:32.898
The staff clearly

05:32.898 --> 05:34.264
Got the message
and pulled

05:34.264 --> 05:35.698
an all-nighter,

05:35.698 --> 05:36.998
cleaning Sante La Brea

05:36.998 --> 05:38.264
inch by inch.

05:40.498 --> 05:43.198
Satisfied that Sante La Brea
was now clean,

05:43.198 --> 05:46.364
Gordon turned his attention
to the food.

05:46.364 --> 05:47.598
Two specials on the menu
tonight, yes?

05:47.598 --> 05:49.098
First dish
is a halibut.

05:49.098 --> 05:50.398
We're gonna cook it
in a marinade.

05:50.398 --> 05:52.198
Second dish, salad of shrimp.

05:52.198 --> 05:54.098
Local shrimps.

05:54.098 --> 05:55.931
It's really nice to see
Chef Ramsay be able

05:55.931 --> 05:57.198
to take hisje ne sais quoi

05:57.198 --> 05:58.898
and bring it down
to our level.

05:58.898 --> 06:00.000
Like we're doing ghetto Gordon.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.064
Like we're doing ghetto Gordon.

06:00.064 --> 06:03.331
But Gordon was not done.

06:03.331 --> 06:07.531
Moments before dinner service,
he shocked the staff again.

06:07.531 --> 06:10.264
Dean, yesterday,

06:10.264 --> 06:13.264
there were some serious
infractions in this restaurant.

06:13.264 --> 06:15.564
Yeah.
Here he is.

06:15.564 --> 06:16.931
Do what you have
to do.

06:16.931 --> 06:18.664
Sir, put your hands
in front of you.

06:18.664 --> 06:20.398
Arms together.

06:27.531 --> 06:29.898
You're not touching anything
tonight.

06:29.898 --> 06:30.000
You're gonna tell them exactly
what you want them to do.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.598
You're gonna tell them exactly
what you want them to do.

06:31.598 --> 06:33.031
Run your business vocally.

06:33.031 --> 06:35.998
You're not getting arrested,
you silly Billy.

06:35.998 --> 06:37.998
Hey, relax.
Look at him.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.331
He's about to cry.

06:39.331 --> 06:41.164
Okay, first table

06:41.164 --> 06:42.664
just about to arrive.
let's go.

06:42.664 --> 06:44.098
Dinner service started well

06:44.098 --> 06:45.898
Because of Gordon's
new specials.

06:45.898 --> 06:47.164
We have a spiced halibut,

06:47.164 --> 06:49.031
which is marinated
in fresh yogurt.

06:49.031 --> 06:51.064
But it didn't take long

06:51.064 --> 06:52.564
for Mark to dampen
the evening.

06:52.564 --> 06:54.164
Mark.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.164
You're sweating again.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.064
Oh, no, use a napkin.

06:57.064 --> 06:58.498
Do you guys have a reservation?

06:58.498 --> 07:00.000
Damp it down
or dry it or absorb--

07:00.000 --> 07:00.698
Damp it down
or dry it or absorb--

07:00.698 --> 07:02.064
I don't know,
but it's all leaking over.

07:02.064 --> 07:04.898
- Oh, my God.
- No,.

07:05.931 --> 07:07.998
Gordon, please,
send him home.

07:07.998 --> 07:09.364
Send--
I don't need him.

07:09.364 --> 07:10.331
It's your  member
of staff.

07:10.331 --> 07:12.431
needs to leave.

07:12.431 --> 07:14.198
Gordon ordered Mark

07:14.198 --> 07:15.598
To run home
and change his shirt.

07:15.598 --> 07:17.731
Secret--made for a lady,

07:17.731 --> 07:19.931
strong enough for a man.

07:19.931 --> 07:21.931
After another up-and-down night

07:21.931 --> 07:23.198
at Sante La Brea,

07:23.198 --> 07:24.498
Gordon still pushed forward

07:24.498 --> 07:26.431
with his plan to re-launch.

07:26.431 --> 07:27.831
He brought in crews
to give the place

07:27.831 --> 07:30.000
a complete makeover.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.531
a complete makeover.

07:30.531 --> 07:31.764
Here we go. Outside patio.

07:31.764 --> 07:32.998
Right. Come through.
Look.

07:32.998 --> 07:34.064
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

07:34.064 --> 07:36.198
No dirty white curtain.

07:36.198 --> 07:37.764
Fresh shades.

07:37.764 --> 07:39.198
Hand-painted blinds.

07:39.198 --> 07:40.198
New benches.

07:40.198 --> 07:41.564
Oh, this
is comfortable, man.

07:43.098 --> 07:45.831
What a vibrant, sexy,
healthy change.

07:45.831 --> 07:47.364
Awesome.

07:47.364 --> 07:48.864
I'm moved to tears so much

07:48.864 --> 07:49.931
'cause he's a brilliant man.

07:49.931 --> 07:52.698
It's really cool.

07:52.698 --> 07:55.198
Chef Ramsay then unveiled
a new menu

07:55.198 --> 07:56.431
That was not only healthy,

07:56.431 --> 07:59.064
but tasted great
as well.

07:59.064 --> 08:00.000
The menu. Absolutely crucial.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.031
The menu. Absolutely crucial.

08:01.031 --> 08:02.498
When you come
into something healthy

08:02.498 --> 08:06.531
and vibrant--
Oh!

08:07.931 --> 08:09.064
Dad got really emotional

08:09.064 --> 08:10.164
When he saw the new menu.

08:10.164 --> 08:11.064
I'm so happy
to see my dad happy.

08:11.064 --> 08:13.531
It's fresh,

08:13.531 --> 08:14.831
and if it's not fresh,
it's not on there.

08:14.831 --> 08:16.931
I'm happy for you.
You deserve it.

08:16.931 --> 08:18.331
And your sons deserve it.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.264
Thank you, man.

08:20.264 --> 08:22.931
Everything was in place

08:22.931 --> 08:24.264
For a successful re-launch.

08:24.264 --> 08:25.264
Halibut?

08:25.264 --> 08:26.498
Wonderful,
wonderful.

08:26.498 --> 08:28.064
Can I get the sea bass?
Sea bass.

08:28.064 --> 08:29.098
Until Dean pushed

08:29.098 --> 08:30.000
A little too hard

08:30.000 --> 08:30.331
A little too hard

08:30.331 --> 08:31.331
in the kitchen.

08:31.331 --> 08:32.898
Just hurry up a little bit.

08:32.898 --> 08:34.564
I need the food out.
Do it fast.

08:34.564 --> 08:36.431
You really want me to leave?

08:36.431 --> 08:38.998
Look, keep in mind
what I say, okay?
What?

08:38.998 --> 08:40.398
What?

08:40.398 --> 08:41.998
I'm keeping in mind
what is said,.

08:41.998 --> 08:43.264
Stop it!

08:43.264 --> 08:44.998
Good-bye!

08:44.998 --> 08:47.864
. I'll do it.

08:50.331 --> 08:51.998
What's the matter?

08:51.998 --> 08:53.031
Get the  out of here.

08:53.031 --> 08:54.498
I don't need him.
Hold on.

08:54.498 --> 08:55.731
Get out.

08:55.731 --> 08:57.164
I'm tired of.

08:57.164 --> 08:58.198
Aurelio! Aurelio!

08:58.198 --> 08:59.698
Re-launch night.

08:59.698 --> 09:00.000
Come on!

09:00.000 --> 09:00.698
Come on!

09:00.698 --> 09:02.031
What in the.

09:02.031 --> 09:03.264
With the restaurant packed

09:03.264 --> 09:04.431
with impatient customers

09:04.431 --> 09:06.598
and no chef
in the kitchen,

09:06.598 --> 09:08.231
re-launch night
was about to turn

09:08.231 --> 09:09.931
into a complete flop.

09:09.931 --> 09:12.264
Where is our grilled cheese
and our hummus?

09:12.264 --> 09:15.098
But Aurelio had second thoughts
and came back

09:15.098 --> 09:16.764
to apologize
to Chef Ramsay.

09:16.764 --> 09:17.831
Come here.
I just want to say I'm sorry.

09:17.831 --> 09:19.331
Okay, no, no,
but listen.

09:19.331 --> 09:20.664
Listen. Come here.
This is important.

09:20.664 --> 09:21.998
This is launch night.

09:21.998 --> 09:23.064
I can't beg the.

09:23.064 --> 09:24.198
You do care,
don't you?

09:24.198 --> 09:25.764
I can't.
I begged you all my life.

09:25.764 --> 09:28.031
Okay, at least pay me

09:28.031 --> 09:29.731
the rest of the money
you owe me.

09:29.731 --> 09:30.000
That's
all you  care about.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.998
That's
all you  care about.

09:30.998 --> 09:31.998
I'm not giving you
a  cent.

09:31.998 --> 09:33.864
I'm not working
till I'm paid.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.031
Okay, how much money
are you owed?

09:35.031 --> 09:37.231
He owe me $145.
Okay, here, here, here.

09:37.231 --> 09:39.064
No, no, no,
come here.

09:39.064 --> 09:40.198
There's $100.

09:40.198 --> 09:41.564
Okay, the rest comes
after service.

09:41.564 --> 09:42.898
Please.

09:42.898 --> 09:44.431
Let's go.

09:44.431 --> 09:46.031
I'm just going to do this
tonight because of him.

09:46.031 --> 09:47.598
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.

09:47.598 --> 09:50.031
Come here.
Calm down.

09:50.031 --> 09:51.931
Big, deep breath,
yeah?

09:51.931 --> 09:53.064
The crisis was averted.

09:53.064 --> 09:54.864
And the kitchen caught up.

09:54.864 --> 09:56.698
And re-launch night
was a Hollywood hit.

09:56.698 --> 09:57.998
Look at it.
It's beautiful.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.764
And I really like
the sauce

09:59.764 --> 10:00.000
and the vegetables.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.164
and the vegetables.

10:01.164 --> 10:02.731
Dean was thrilled.

10:02.731 --> 10:05.231
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

10:05.231 --> 10:06.331
And so was Chef Ramsay

10:06.331 --> 10:08.998
because this restaurant
was one

10:08.998 --> 10:10.198
of the toughest turnarounds
ever.

10:13.698 --> 10:17.931
Now it's time to see how
Sante La Brea is doing today.

10:17.931 --> 10:19.231
I'm here at the scene

10:19.231 --> 10:20.831
of Hollywood's biggest flop
last year,

10:20.831 --> 10:22.098
Sante La Brea.

10:22.098 --> 10:22.998
Now this place
gave me a headache,

10:22.998 --> 10:24.831
an even bigger stomachache,

10:24.831 --> 10:26.331
so I'm back to see
if this Hollywood story

10:26.331 --> 10:29.898
has a happy ending.

10:29.898 --> 10:30.000
Coming up...
I'm shocked.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.098
Coming up...
I'm shocked.

10:32.098 --> 10:35.098
Not one, but three
shocking surprises

10:35.098 --> 10:36.764
the moment Chef Ramsay walks in.

10:36.764 --> 10:38.731
Is there anything you wanted
to say to me now

10:38.731 --> 10:40.331
that you didn't get a chance
to say last year?

10:40.331 --> 10:41.331
And Mark leaves Gordon

10:41.331 --> 10:42.331
In complete disbelief.

10:42.331 --> 10:44.098
Say that again.

10:44.098 --> 10:45.764
Then we go back to Giuseppi's,

10:45.764 --> 10:49.098
A failing restaurant
tearing a family apart.

10:49.098 --> 10:50.931
How many times you looked
at me and said, "Hey,

10:50.931 --> 10:52.031
holy , good job"?

10:52.031 --> 10:53.431
Not once, Dad,

10:53.431 --> 10:55.031
so don't tell me
about that.

10:55.031 --> 10:56.831
Chef Ramsay finds out

10:56.831 --> 10:58.264
If the Borgias have stayed
together,

10:58.264 --> 11:00.000
or whether they've gone back

11:00.000 --> 11:00.131
or whether they've gone back

11:00.131 --> 11:02.931
to their old brawling ways.

11:02.931 --> 11:05.598
Well, it's your  kitchen
then clean it, you lazy.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.231
Plus you'll find out

11:07.231 --> 11:10.431
One of the top three fights
in Kitchen Nightmares history.

11:10.431 --> 11:12.931
All this
when this special edition

11:12.931 --> 11:14.731
of Kitchen Nightmares continues.

11:18.214 --> 11:19.614
When Chef Ramsay goes to work

11:19.614 --> 11:22.047
on any of the restaurants,
he always does

11:22.047 --> 11:24.080
a thorough kitchen inspection.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.280
And while some
are absolutely fine,

11:25.280 --> 11:27.514
others are a disgusting mess.

11:27.514 --> 11:28.880
Oh, God.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.380
Here are
the three worst inspections

11:31.380 --> 11:32.914
in Kitchen Nightmares history.

11:32.914 --> 11:35.347
Fiesta Sunrise,

11:35.347 --> 11:38.547
a Mexican restaurant
in West Nyack, New York.

11:38.547 --> 11:40.514
- What's that?
- The burritos.

11:40.514 --> 11:42.180
What's that one?

11:42.180 --> 11:43.280
The chicken for enchiladas.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.214
Oh. What's that?

11:45.214 --> 11:45.575
That was ground beef.

11:45.575 --> 11:46.914
That was ground beef.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.114
Ground beef?

11:48.114 --> 11:51.214
How come its  fat,
you idiot?

11:51.214 --> 11:53.014
It's fatter than you.

11:53.014 --> 11:54.380
What's that?

11:54.380 --> 11:55.747
The beans.

11:55.747 --> 11:56.947
Ugh.
How?

11:56.947 --> 12:00.347
It's like a cement mixer.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.080
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:05.080 --> 12:08.047
I'm so sorry,
but we're stopping service.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.680
Seascape Inn,

12:12.680 --> 12:15.214
A family restaurant
in Islip, New York.

12:15.214 --> 12:15.575
God, when was the last time
this place was cleaned?

12:15.575 --> 12:18.080
God, when was the last time
this place was cleaned?

12:18.080 --> 12:19.414
Oh,.

12:19.414 --> 12:21.880
Oh, my God.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.114
What is that?

12:23.114 --> 12:24.680
So that's the pesto

12:24.680 --> 12:25.847
I had for lunch.

12:25.847 --> 12:28.414
This is 10,000 times worse

12:28.414 --> 12:29.747
than I thought it would be.

12:29.747 --> 12:32.080
How dare you cook me a lunch

12:32.080 --> 12:33.847
out of this kitchen?

12:33.847 --> 12:36.214
Touch the wall,
you dirty pig!

12:36.214 --> 12:37.714
This is disgusting.

12:37.714 --> 12:40.747
I'm closing it down.

12:40.747 --> 12:42.847
And number one,

12:42.847 --> 12:45.575
Dillon's, an Indian restaurant
in New York City.

12:45.575 --> 12:46.247
Dillon's, an Indian restaurant
in New York City.

12:46.247 --> 12:49.014
It's beyond disgusting.

12:49.014 --> 12:51.114
You will kill somebody.

12:51.114 --> 12:53.014
What is that?

12:53.014 --> 12:55.080
Is that for rats
or mice?

12:55.080 --> 12:56.080
Food for to catch
a rat.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.114
So we have got rats here.

12:58.114 --> 13:00.047
Rat is all over the place.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.880
Oh, my God, look.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.214
I got one
in my hair.

13:03.214 --> 13:04.114
It's cockroaches.

13:04.114 --> 13:05.614
Boxes full of them.

13:05.614 --> 13:08.080
Oh, my God, look.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.114
- There they are there.
- Oh,.

13:11.114 --> 13:14.080
Oh, my God.
Look at that!

13:14.080 --> 13:15.575
There you go.

13:15.575 --> 13:15.580
There you go.

13:15.580 --> 13:17.680
Now back to Sante La Brea,

13:17.680 --> 13:20.280
Whose kitchen was no treat
for Chef Ramsay either.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.747
It's rotten.

13:21.747 --> 13:23.247
But another huge problem

13:23.247 --> 13:25.780
With this restaurant
was the owner Dean.

13:25.780 --> 13:27.080
You just got
on her!

13:27.080 --> 13:29.280
Don't  do it!

13:29.280 --> 13:31.080
He lashed out at everyone,

13:31.080 --> 13:34.180
Including his two sons
Arthur and Sammy.

13:34.180 --> 13:38.180
Go --even if I'm
wrong, do it.

13:38.180 --> 13:39.380
And then there was Mark,

13:39.380 --> 13:40.747
the sweaty manager,

13:40.747 --> 13:42.447
who really didn't know
what to do.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.780
Damp it down or dry it
or absorb--

13:44.780 --> 13:45.575
I don't know,
but it's all leaking over.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.447
I don't know,
but it's all leaking over.

13:46.447 --> 13:47.914
- Oh, my God.
- No,.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.514
It was a difficult turnaround,

13:49.514 --> 13:52.180
But Chef Ramsay
left Sante La Brea in good shape

13:52.180 --> 13:53.280
for the future.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.280
It's a year later.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.280
Time to see
if this Hollywood eatery

13:57.280 --> 13:58.414
is still in the spotlight.

13:58.414 --> 13:59.780
Ah, Sante La Brea.

13:59.780 --> 14:01.147
Last year, they gave me salmon
that made me sick,

14:01.147 --> 14:03.214
the restaurant manager
had B.O.,

14:03.214 --> 14:05.380
and I had to bribe the chef
not to quit.

14:05.380 --> 14:09.580
Let's see if these guys have
finally got their act together.

14:12.214 --> 14:14.114
Good morning.
Good morning, Gordon.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.047
Welcome back.
Good to see you, sir.
Are you well?

14:15.047 --> 14:15.575
Good to see you, man.
I'm very well.

14:15.575 --> 14:16.047
Good to see you, man.
I'm very well.

14:16.047 --> 14:17.180
Thank you.
You're looking good.

14:17.180 --> 14:18.914
You're looking fresh.
Arthur, how are you?

14:18.914 --> 14:19.947
Good to see you, buddy.
You well?
You too.

14:19.947 --> 14:22.080
And how's things?
Things are good.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.680
Things have been improved
since last year.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.280
And you know...
Where is Dad?

14:25.280 --> 14:28.947
My father retired,
passed it on to us.

14:28.947 --> 14:30.047
Overseas.
He's in Syria, basically.

14:30.047 --> 14:32.214
He's overseas.
I'm shocked.

14:32.214 --> 14:33.780
If there was one thing
that was a concern

14:33.780 --> 14:36.414
for me when I was here
is just the level of anxiety

14:36.414 --> 14:37.847
and, I suppose, stress.

14:37.847 --> 14:38.847
Yeah, definitely
over-stressed.

14:38.847 --> 14:39.880
Dare I ask?

14:39.880 --> 14:41.447
Where is he?

14:41.447 --> 14:43.414
Mark.

14:43.414 --> 14:44.414
Ah.

14:44.414 --> 14:45.575
Where--
he's in the back. Mark.

14:45.575 --> 14:46.280
Where--
he's in the back. Mark.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.747
No, he's not in the back?
Thank God.

14:47.747 --> 14:51.380
No, Mark has--we put him
out to pasture big time.

14:51.380 --> 14:52.847
Mark's gone as well?

14:52.847 --> 14:54.780
I do not miss Mark at all.

14:54.780 --> 14:56.080
Not for a second,

14:56.080 --> 14:58.547
not for an ounce of my being.
Nothing.

14:58.547 --> 14:59.714
Aurelio's gone.

14:59.714 --> 15:00.680
All the cancer.

15:00.680 --> 15:01.747
The chef--
the chef's gone as well?

15:01.747 --> 15:02.780
Oh, yeah.

15:02.780 --> 15:05.047
The guy was one
of the many cancers

15:05.047 --> 15:06.214
we had infecting
this whole place.

15:06.214 --> 15:08.880
I'm pleased to see
you both standing strong.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.180
More importantly the fact
that the business,

15:10.180 --> 15:11.180
you know, is surviving.

15:11.180 --> 15:12.680
We're doing very well.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.180
I'm gonna have
a quick look around.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.214
But before I do that, I'm gonna
quickly go to the bathroom.

15:15.214 --> 15:15.575
Thank you, Arthur.

15:15.575 --> 15:17.847
Thank you, Arthur.

15:17.847 --> 15:20.880
Now they may never want
to see Mark again,

15:20.880 --> 15:22.080
but I certainly do.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.580
We went to bloody hell and back,
him and I.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.447
Hi, Mark, it's Gordon.

15:28.447 --> 15:29.547
I'm very well, thank you.
How are you?

15:29.547 --> 15:31.214
Listen, I'm slightly shocked
the fact

15:31.214 --> 15:32.780
that I just returned,
you're not here.

15:32.780 --> 15:34.547
Can I meet you
in five or ten minutes?

15:34.547 --> 15:36.214
I know you live locally.

15:36.214 --> 15:37.347
Okay, good.

15:37.347 --> 15:38.714
Now just to keep it
under wraps,

15:38.714 --> 15:40.114
will you call me
when you're two minutes away

15:40.114 --> 15:41.414
so I can come out
and meet you?

15:44.047 --> 15:45.575
Dare I?

15:45.575 --> 15:46.014
Dare I?

15:46.014 --> 15:47.180
Dare I?
Please.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.680
Remember here last time?

15:48.680 --> 15:50.014
Of course.

15:50.014 --> 15:52.014
The chicken comes in fresh.

15:52.014 --> 15:53.847
I guess this is extra.

15:53.847 --> 15:55.180
Why are you lying?

15:55.180 --> 15:57.180
First thing that hits me
are the labels.

15:57.180 --> 15:59.747
Labels and dates.
Look at the floor.

15:59.747 --> 16:02.014
The floor's clean enough
to bloody eat off it.

16:02.014 --> 16:04.047
No fear at all
Gordon walking into the fridge.

16:04.047 --> 16:06.414
I wanted to show him

16:06.414 --> 16:08.280
how organic and how clean
everything is.

16:08.280 --> 16:10.614
Well done.
Huh?

16:11.947 --> 16:13.547
Oh, two seconds,
I just got to get this.

16:13.547 --> 16:14.847
Hello?

16:14.847 --> 16:15.575
Hi.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.180
Hi.

16:17.180 --> 16:18.347
Okay, okay.

16:18.347 --> 16:20.247
Give me two seconds.
I'll be just one minute.

16:20.247 --> 16:23.514
And so nice
to talk to you.

16:23.514 --> 16:25.880
What a surprise.
What a surprise.

16:25.880 --> 16:26.914
First of all,
it's good to see you.

16:26.914 --> 16:28.114
Why did you leave?

16:28.114 --> 16:30.014
There was a little dissension
between all of us.

16:30.014 --> 16:31.014
I never had

16:31.014 --> 16:32.280
the respect back
after that.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.380
I was the butt of the joke.

16:33.380 --> 16:35.014
Do you miss working there?

16:35.014 --> 16:36.014
It was the people.
It was nice.

16:36.014 --> 16:37.080
I would have liked
to have taken your menu

16:37.080 --> 16:38.080
and ran with it.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.714
You're still sweating.

16:39.714 --> 16:41.747
Look.
Um, it's...

16:41.747 --> 16:44.180
We're not even working,
and you're still sweating.

16:44.180 --> 16:45.214
So what are you doing,
apart from sweating?

16:45.214 --> 16:45.575
Besides sweating,
I'm working

16:45.575 --> 16:46.414
Besides sweating,
I'm working

16:46.414 --> 16:48.347
for a company right now
that does raw food

16:48.347 --> 16:49.680
'cause I am into raw food.

16:49.680 --> 16:52.280
Ugh.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.047
Is there anything you wanted
to say to me now

16:54.047 --> 16:55.247
that you didn't get a chance
to say last year?

16:55.247 --> 16:56.347
Give me a job.

16:56.347 --> 16:58.114
Say that again.

16:58.114 --> 17:00.214
Give me a job.

17:00.214 --> 17:01.414
I thought
that when you came along,

17:01.414 --> 17:03.014
I thought
maybe God delivered you.

17:03.014 --> 17:04.247
Yeah.
Yeah.

17:04.247 --> 17:06.080
So hold on.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.080
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

17:07.080 --> 17:08.114
Do something
about your sweating first,

17:08.114 --> 17:09.780
and I may think
about it.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.680
It's like Niagara Falls
with your arm pits.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.880
It's not Niagara Falls.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.114
Thank you.
Good to see you.

17:14.114 --> 17:15.380
Look after yourself.
All right.

17:15.380 --> 17:15.575
I will. You do the same.
Take care.

17:15.575 --> 17:18.014
I will. You do the same.
Take care.

17:18.014 --> 17:20.047
Up next, Arthur and Sammy

17:20.047 --> 17:21.880
Turn the tables
on Chef Ramsay.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.947
You little.

17:23.947 --> 17:25.580
See how they got one over
on Gordon.

17:25.580 --> 17:27.214
Unbelievable.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.880
And later, Gordon returns
to Giuseppi's...

17:28.880 --> 17:30.780
I don't like that steak.
I don't like it.

17:30.780 --> 17:32.114
- It's well-done, Sam.
- It looks like.

17:32.114 --> 17:34.214
A struggling Italian restaurant

17:34.214 --> 17:36.047
Where a father and son
were at war

17:36.047 --> 17:37.614
and mom was caught
in the middle.

17:37.614 --> 17:39.347
I've been scrubbing floors
next to you.

17:39.347 --> 17:41.047
I've been wanting you
to  notice me

17:41.047 --> 17:43.780
For how long?

17:43.780 --> 17:45.280
We'll find out
if the restaurant has survived

17:45.280 --> 17:45.575
The recession and whether this
family is united or divided...

17:45.575 --> 17:48.780
The recession and whether this
family is united or divided...

17:50.580 --> 17:53.247
When Kitchen Nightmares
Revisited continues.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.645
Chef Ramsay's revisit
to Sante La Brea

18:00.645 --> 18:01.645
has been full
of surprises.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.178
I'm shocked.

18:03.178 --> 18:05.345
Gone are Mark,
the sweaty manager,

18:05.345 --> 18:07.545
And Aurelio,
the belligerent chef.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.345
But the biggest surprise
was Dean,

18:09.345 --> 18:12.145
who moved to the Middle East

18:12.145 --> 18:14.577
and left the restaurant
to his sons.

18:14.577 --> 18:16.577
When I first met
your father, I felt

18:16.577 --> 18:18.644
that he was on the verge
of a nervous breakdown.

18:18.644 --> 18:21.177
Don't eat, don't drink,
don't do anything here.

18:21.177 --> 18:22.911
This is not good, okay?

18:22.911 --> 18:24.111
Whenever I see that,

18:24.111 --> 18:24.674
I'm gonna be pissed off!

18:24.674 --> 18:26.277
I'm gonna be pissed off!

18:26.277 --> 18:29.111
I don't think we could really be
committed 100%

18:29.111 --> 18:30.477
while he was still around

18:30.477 --> 18:31.677
because, even if we did try
to make decisions,

18:31.677 --> 18:34.144
and even if we did try
to implement our own ideas,

18:34.144 --> 18:35.511
he would just go over our heads
and change things.

18:35.511 --> 18:37.077
Can we call him?

18:37.077 --> 18:38.611
Definitely, it's the middle
of the night,

18:38.611 --> 18:39.911
but I'm sure he'll get up
to talk to you.

18:39.911 --> 18:43.944
- Yo, Dad.
- Hello.

18:43.944 --> 18:45.144
There we go.

18:45.144 --> 18:46.577
Thank you.
Thank you.

18:46.577 --> 18:49.611
Dean, it's Gordon.
How are you?

18:49.611 --> 18:52.344
Good, listen, I'm so sorry
you're not here,

18:52.344 --> 18:54.674
but more importantly
how have you been?

18:54.674 --> 18:55.677
but more importantly
how have you been?

18:59.777 --> 19:02.011
I think the boys
are doing a great job,

19:02.011 --> 19:04.311
and I'm sure you're gonna be
incredibly proud of them

19:04.311 --> 19:06.011
when you come back
and see what they've done.

19:12.244 --> 19:13.511
I think
Dad's very proud of us.

19:13.511 --> 19:14.644
Absolutely.

19:14.644 --> 19:16.077
I mean, the fact
that he can actually leave

19:16.077 --> 19:17.111
and go overseas

19:17.111 --> 19:18.111
and chill with his family
for a bit

19:18.111 --> 19:19.444
and leave the place
with us.

19:19.444 --> 19:20.744
I think he's very, very proud.
Very happy.

19:20.744 --> 19:21.944
And one more thing I wanted

19:21.944 --> 19:23.844
to say before I go...
mogodufu!

19:28.977 --> 19:30.844
Bye-bye now.

19:30.844 --> 19:32.977
So business,

19:32.977 --> 19:34.011
month on, month in,

19:34.011 --> 19:35.944
from this time a year ago,

19:35.944 --> 19:37.511
where are we?
I could say about 10% better.

19:37.511 --> 19:38.944
So you're up 10%?

19:38.944 --> 19:40.611
Even considering
the recession.

19:40.611 --> 19:41.977
So who replaced Mark?

19:41.977 --> 19:44.411
Dawn.
Yeah, got my girlfriend in.

19:44.411 --> 19:46.977
There she is.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.777
You lucky man.
Right.

19:48.777 --> 19:50.944
See. Nothing.

19:50.944 --> 19:53.111
I'm good, I hope.

19:53.111 --> 19:54.674
Salmon's cooked beautifully.
Nice and pink.

19:54.674 --> 19:56.011
Salmon's cooked beautifully.
Nice and pink.

19:56.011 --> 19:58.977
My God.

19:58.977 --> 20:01.777
I told my chef,
make this one  good.

20:01.777 --> 20:03.011
That is delicious.

20:03.011 --> 20:04.444
Really good.

20:04.444 --> 20:06.244
Now this is a asparagus dish.

20:06.244 --> 20:09.277
Ginger and, like,
a vegan tofu cream sauce.

20:09.277 --> 20:11.477
I've never been
a big fan of tofu,

20:11.477 --> 20:12.944
but you managed to make it
delicious.

20:12.944 --> 20:14.611
It's soy protein.
It's soy protein.

20:14.611 --> 20:16.177
On chicken.
On chicken.

20:16.177 --> 20:17.944
I can't believe you bastards
made me eat that.

20:17.944 --> 20:19.177
You sneak that in
without even telling me.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.011
You'd want to eat more,
wouldn't you?

20:21.011 --> 20:22.244
Not only that, I just said
it's delicious,

20:22.244 --> 20:23.611
which it is delicious.
I stand by it.

20:23.611 --> 20:24.674
I wanted to wait
till you...

20:24.674 --> 20:25.177
I wanted to wait
till you...

20:25.177 --> 20:26.244
You little.

20:26.244 --> 20:27.277
You're happy with that one,

20:27.277 --> 20:28.311
aren't you?
yes?

20:28.311 --> 20:30.677
We fooled the--
we fooled the master.

20:30.677 --> 20:32.144
Honestly, I'm very proud.

20:32.144 --> 20:33.677
And more importantly,

20:33.677 --> 20:34.677
the fact that Dad's out of it

20:34.677 --> 20:36.344
and, you know,
less stressful.

20:36.344 --> 20:38.011
He can come back here
one day

20:38.011 --> 20:39.977
and enjoy the fruits
of his labor, yeah,

20:39.977 --> 20:40.977
and your talents.

20:40.977 --> 20:42.644
Keep it going.
Absolutely.

20:42.644 --> 20:44.111
If it wasn't for Gordon,

20:44.111 --> 20:45.977
we'd probably be out
of business.

20:45.977 --> 20:47.077
I can easily say that.

20:47.077 --> 20:48.744
Well done.

20:48.744 --> 20:50.344
Good to see you guys.
Awesome. Take care.

20:50.344 --> 20:51.611
Likewise.
Take care, yes?

20:51.611 --> 20:53.477
Take care.
Well done.

20:55.077 --> 20:56.977
Sammy and Arthur
are well on their way.

20:56.977 --> 20:58.911
They have a great location,
great, healthy food,

20:58.911 --> 21:00.944
and more importantly,
a manager that doesn't sweat

21:00.944 --> 21:01.911
all over the menus.

21:01.911 --> 21:05.011
A Hollywood story
with a happy ending.

21:07.344 --> 21:09.444
Now it's time for a quick update

21:09.444 --> 21:10.911
on Finn McCool's.

21:10.911 --> 21:14.311
♪ my young love said
to me ♪

21:14.311 --> 21:16.177
Chef Ramsay first visited them

21:16.177 --> 21:17.344
a few years ago.

21:17.344 --> 21:18.977
Buddy and his two sons

21:18.977 --> 21:20.611
were going bankrupt.

21:20.611 --> 21:21.944
If there was
no significant improvement,

21:21.944 --> 21:23.511
How long could you afford
to stay open for?

21:23.511 --> 21:24.674
We're in trouble right now.

21:24.674 --> 21:24.677
We're in trouble right now.

21:24.677 --> 21:27.077
The food was a disaster.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.677
Always the sign
of a very insecure chef.

21:28.677 --> 21:31.011
When he macerates everything
in balsalmic vinegar.

21:31.011 --> 21:32.944
They had no customers.

21:32.944 --> 21:35.011
Why don't more locals,
you know, come?

21:35.011 --> 21:37.577
Maybe they've come here
and had a bad experience

21:37.577 --> 21:38.677
and didn't want to come back.

21:38.677 --> 21:40.577
Jason had no hope.

21:40.577 --> 21:42.744
I'm worried
every night going to bed.

21:42.744 --> 21:44.411
Are you going to be able
to pay this mortgage?

21:44.411 --> 21:45.844
I can't describe to you

21:45.844 --> 21:47.077
how stressful that is.

21:47.077 --> 21:49.111
And Brian had given up
in the kitchen.

21:49.111 --> 21:50.277
I'm done working here.

21:50.277 --> 21:51.911
In one week, Chef Ramsay

21:51.911 --> 21:53.977
not only changed the restaurant,

21:53.977 --> 21:54.674
but the family's attitude
as well.

21:54.674 --> 21:57.011
but the family's attitude
as well.

21:58.011 --> 21:58.944
Last year,

21:58.944 --> 22:00.444
when Chef Ramsay returned,

22:00.444 --> 22:02.744
we found out that buddy
maintained all the changes

22:02.744 --> 22:03.977
and business boomed.

22:03.977 --> 22:06.077
Business, how's it been
the last 12 months?

22:06.077 --> 22:08.944
We are up,
average across the board,

22:08.944 --> 22:11.344
35%.
Great.

22:11.344 --> 22:13.411
Buddy was finally making money,

22:13.411 --> 22:15.844
And Brian was a changed man.

22:15.844 --> 22:17.011
You sound so confident, Brian,
you know that?

22:17.011 --> 22:19.077
We're having fun.
Great.

22:19.077 --> 22:21.144
Unfortunately, buddy suffered
a heart attack

22:21.144 --> 22:22.977
But is now doing fine.

22:22.977 --> 22:24.674
This year,
another new development

22:24.674 --> 22:24.944
This year,
another new development

22:24.944 --> 22:26.844
for the mazio family.

22:26.844 --> 22:29.111
A buyer made buddy an offer
he couldn't refuse.

22:29.111 --> 22:31.111
He turned a significant profit,

22:31.111 --> 22:33.911
and he gives all the credit
to Chef Ramsay.

22:33.911 --> 22:35.244
We did everything he said.

22:35.244 --> 22:37.777
And he was spot on.

22:37.777 --> 22:41.177
Buddy is now doing work
as a private investigator.

22:41.177 --> 22:42.577
As for his two sons,

22:42.577 --> 22:44.611
they both remained
at Finn McCool's.

22:44.611 --> 22:45.977
I love my brother
to death.

22:45.977 --> 22:48.011
Jason is still charming
customers at the bar.

22:48.011 --> 22:49.577
What's up?

22:49.577 --> 22:50.644
And Brian is still the chef

22:50.644 --> 22:52.477
And impressing everyone
with his food.

22:52.477 --> 22:54.674
Perfect.

22:54.674 --> 22:55.077
Perfect.

22:55.077 --> 22:56.911
Coming up...

22:56.911 --> 22:59.177
It was one of the most emotional
Kitchen Nightmares ever.

22:59.177 --> 23:00.811
Dad, I really, truly

23:00.811 --> 23:02.244
only want you
to be proud of me.

23:02.244 --> 23:03.977
Chef Ramsay brings
a feuding father and son

23:03.977 --> 23:05.444
back together.

23:05.444 --> 23:06.677
I never stopped loving you.

23:06.677 --> 23:09.111
Now a year later,

23:09.111 --> 23:10.411
Gordon returns to see
if the Borgias

23:10.411 --> 23:12.911
are at peace or at war...
It sucks.

23:12.911 --> 23:14.644
And whether
this family restaurant

23:14.644 --> 23:16.953
has survived
the economic downturn.

23:16.953 --> 23:19.195
It's gone.

23:19.195 --> 23:21.627
Find out when Kitchen Nightmares
Revisited continues.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.421
Now it's time to update you

23:27.421 --> 23:29.188
on Giuseppi's.

23:29.188 --> 23:30.121
But first,
let's take a look back

23:30.121 --> 23:32.354
at what this restaurant was like
a year ago.

23:32.354 --> 23:35.254
Located about 30 minutes
from Detroit,

23:35.254 --> 23:36.354
this Italian restaurant

23:36.354 --> 23:38.421
was not only failing badly,

23:38.421 --> 23:41.154
it was also tearing
a family apart.

23:42.854 --> 23:44.154
How many times you looked at me

23:44.154 --> 23:45.188
And said, "Hey,

23:45.188 --> 23:46.088
good job"?

23:46.088 --> 23:47.088
Not once, Dad,
so don't tell me

23:47.088 --> 23:48.821
about that.

23:48.821 --> 23:49.954
Joe, the old school dad,

23:49.954 --> 23:51.588
And his 28-year-old son Sam

23:51.588 --> 23:52.988
were at each other's throats.

23:52.988 --> 23:53.769
Now why can't you show me

23:53.769 --> 23:54.521
Now why can't you show me

23:54.521 --> 23:56.254
the same set of
that I had

23:56.254 --> 23:57.088
And just go out there
and try

23:57.088 --> 23:58.954
to make something
out of it?

23:58.954 --> 24:00.288
I feel
that sometimes you hate me.

24:00.288 --> 24:02.188
And wife and mother Kathy

24:02.188 --> 24:03.454
was caught in the middle.

24:03.454 --> 24:04.754
I'm tired of playing referee.

24:04.754 --> 24:06.188
I don't want
to be everyone's mom.

24:06.188 --> 24:07.188
On top of that,

24:07.188 --> 24:08.454
Joe's health was failing,

24:08.454 --> 24:12.254
and he was too stubborn
to slow down.

24:12.254 --> 24:13.688
When Gordon first arrived,

24:13.688 --> 24:15.088
he had a sample
of the menu.

24:16.321 --> 24:18.354
Like a mouthful of hubba-bubba.

24:18.354 --> 24:19.954
And it soon became clear

24:19.954 --> 24:22.821
Why this restaurant
was being shunned by the locals.

24:22.821 --> 24:23.769
Can't really identify
any flavors

24:23.769 --> 24:24.188
Can't really identify
any flavors

24:24.188 --> 24:26.154
because it's just absolutely
piping hot.

24:26.154 --> 24:28.021
Almost like it's being nuked
in the microwave

24:28.021 --> 24:30.688
for three minutes.

24:30.688 --> 24:33.621
That eggplant was bland,
milky, spongy.

24:33.621 --> 24:35.654
Chef, we got

24:35.654 --> 24:37.354
Probably 3,000 respond when
we did this questionnaire.

24:37.354 --> 24:39.788
And we didn't get one negative
thing about the food.

24:39.788 --> 24:41.154
So where the
are they then?

24:41.154 --> 24:42.288
I don't know.

24:42.288 --> 24:44.188
All you doing
is firing me  excuses.

24:44.188 --> 24:46.154
Don't  me,
and I won't  you.

24:46.154 --> 24:47.621
Do you understand?

24:47.621 --> 24:50.088
Yes.

24:50.088 --> 24:52.354
That night,

24:52.354 --> 24:53.488
Chef Ramsay was back

24:53.488 --> 24:53.769
to observe dinner service.

24:53.769 --> 24:54.954
to observe dinner service.

24:54.954 --> 24:56.188
How are you today?

24:56.188 --> 24:57.121
Good. How are you?

24:57.121 --> 24:58.621
Hi, how are you?
My name is Carol.

25:02.354 --> 25:03.488
Does that come off then?

25:05.421 --> 25:06.521
Looks like a cockatoo.

25:08.488 --> 25:10.254
In the kitchen, Chef Ramsay

25:10.254 --> 25:11.588
was horrified
that the microwave

25:11.588 --> 25:14.088
was cooking more
than the chefs.

25:14.088 --> 25:15.288
How come you roast potatoes
in the microwave?

25:15.288 --> 25:16.854
That's the program here

25:16.854 --> 25:18.254
that's what giuseppi wants.

25:18.254 --> 25:19.921
Has he lost
his  marbles?

25:19.921 --> 25:22.421
Just minutes after customers
ordered food...

25:22.421 --> 25:23.769
You ready, honey?

25:23.769 --> 25:23.921
You ready, honey?

25:23.921 --> 25:25.488
I am. I would like
the eggplant with meat sauce.

25:25.488 --> 25:28.121
Subpar food was flying
out of the kitchen.

25:28.121 --> 25:29.788
The food comes out quick.
Is that normal?

25:29.788 --> 25:31.154
Really quick.
Too quick, I think.

25:31.154 --> 25:32.754
Unfortunately,

25:32.754 --> 25:34.154
as fast
as the food went out,

25:34.154 --> 25:35.688
that's how fast
it came back.

25:35.688 --> 25:37.488
The sauce is warm,
but the inside...

25:37.488 --> 25:38.521
It needs to be warmed up.

25:38.521 --> 25:39.921
This is supposed
to be blackened.

25:39.921 --> 25:41.354
It wasn't blackened,
and that's all fat.

25:43.654 --> 25:44.988
The restaurant's engine room,

25:44.988 --> 25:47.088
the kitchen,
was a dysfunctional mess.

25:47.088 --> 25:49.121
Why don't we ever have towels
in this line?

25:49.121 --> 25:50.521
There's a towel
right there.

25:50.521 --> 25:51.688
I wouldn't wipe my ass
with that.

25:51.688 --> 25:52.821
There's towels right there.

25:52.821 --> 25:53.769
There's a towel down here.
Joe?

25:53.769 --> 25:54.654
There's a towel down here.
Joe?

25:54.654 --> 25:56.321
Did not like.

25:56.321 --> 25:57.954
What the hell?

25:57.954 --> 25:59.288
How's that steak
on that redo?

25:59.288 --> 26:00.188
Do you want me to cook it?

26:00.188 --> 26:01.688
It doesn't come
out of my ass, okay?

26:01.688 --> 26:03.421
All right. I hope it doesn't
come out of your ass.

26:03.421 --> 26:05.654
Don't touch his steak.

26:05.654 --> 26:07.288
What the hell?

26:07.288 --> 26:08.621
Sam, get your ass
out of there.

26:11.021 --> 26:14.654
With emotions between father
and son still raw,

26:14.654 --> 26:17.021
Chef Ramsay tried to mend
the relationship.

26:17.021 --> 26:18.288
Is Sam a good chef?

26:18.288 --> 26:21.854
He likes to cook.

26:21.854 --> 26:23.769
You don't put enough time here
to get involved.

26:23.769 --> 26:24.988
You don't put enough time here
to get involved.

26:24.988 --> 26:26.321
Where's your fire
in your belly?

26:26.321 --> 26:29.754
I mean, why can't you show me
the same set of

26:29.754 --> 26:31.354
That I had
and just go out there

26:31.354 --> 26:32.854
and try to make something
out of it?

26:32.854 --> 26:34.254
I've been
doing that

26:34.254 --> 26:36.288
since I was  13
next to you.

26:36.288 --> 26:37.421
You don't see me?

26:37.421 --> 26:39.121
You don't see me?
See what, Sam?

26:39.121 --> 26:40.854
I've been scrubbing floors
next to you.

26:40.854 --> 26:42.321
I've been wanting you
to  notice me

26:42.321 --> 26:44.621
For how long?
I notice you.

26:44.621 --> 26:45.621
How many times you looked at me
and said,

26:45.621 --> 26:47.788
"Hey, holy ,
good job"?

26:47.788 --> 26:50.788
Not once, Dad, so don't tell me
about that.

26:50.788 --> 26:52.254
The next night,

26:52.254 --> 26:53.769
to bring order
to this kitchen and avoid

26:53.769 --> 26:53.854
to bring order
to this kitchen and avoid

26:53.854 --> 26:55.154
more fighting,

26:55.154 --> 26:56.521
Gordon made sure everyone

26:56.521 --> 26:57.788
had specific roles.

26:57.788 --> 26:59.421
You're gonna be expediting
in and out,

26:59.421 --> 27:00.754
and you're on the line, yeah?
Yes.

27:00.754 --> 27:02.021
Good.
Good man.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.088
But Joe couldn't confine himself

27:03.088 --> 27:04.821
to just expediting.

27:04.821 --> 27:05.921
Don't overcook it, Sam.

27:05.921 --> 27:07.954
It's just boom, boom,
done.

27:07.954 --> 27:09.188
Just moments later,

27:09.188 --> 27:10.188
Joe was back at the stove,

27:10.188 --> 27:12.654
doing what Sam was supposed
to be doing.

27:12.654 --> 27:14.088
Joe.

27:14.088 --> 27:16.954
Are you expediting?
No, not really.

27:16.954 --> 27:18.488
I can't read
without my glasses.

27:18.488 --> 27:19.588
Your glasses around your neck.

27:21.521 --> 27:22.921
I don't like that steak.

27:22.921 --> 27:23.769
I don't like it.

27:23.769 --> 27:23.921
I don't like it.

27:23.921 --> 27:25.088
It's well-done, Sam.

27:25.088 --> 27:26.288
It looks like.

27:26.288 --> 27:28.154
With Gordon's encouragement,

27:28.154 --> 27:29.354
Sam finally worked up
the courage to stand up

27:29.354 --> 27:31.121
to his dad.
Sam.

27:31.121 --> 27:32.488
Yeah.
Kick him off there.

27:32.488 --> 27:34.588
I'm sorry, Dad,
but your  Jigger's up.

27:34.588 --> 27:36.254
You got to get off.
Thank you.

27:37.988 --> 27:39.154
Late that night,

27:39.154 --> 27:40.954
Gordon's crew worked
around the clock

27:40.954 --> 27:42.321
to turn this restaurant

27:42.321 --> 27:44.188
into a modern Italian eatery.

27:44.188 --> 27:45.688
Come through.

27:45.688 --> 27:47.254
Whoo-hoo!

27:47.254 --> 27:48.254
Look at this.

27:49.588 --> 27:50.821
Oh, my God!
Isn't it beautiful?

27:50.821 --> 27:52.421
Yes!

27:52.421 --> 27:53.769
Yes!
Ah-ha!

27:53.769 --> 27:54.121
Yes!
Ah-ha!

27:54.121 --> 27:56.154
It was claustrophobic.

27:56.154 --> 27:58.788
Now it's a modern,
contemporary

27:58.788 --> 27:59.821
Italian restaurant.

27:59.821 --> 28:01.421
Oh, my God!

28:01.421 --> 28:02.988
He's holding Sammy.

28:02.988 --> 28:04.154
He was just born.

28:04.154 --> 28:07.254
When I saw my father
look at the pictures

28:07.254 --> 28:09.254
of me and him
when I was a little boy,

28:09.254 --> 28:11.254
you know, when I saw
a tear come to his eyes,

28:11.254 --> 28:12.688
I almost lost it.

28:12.688 --> 28:14.154
Is it lovely?
It's beautiful.

28:16.921 --> 28:17.954
Now that the restaurant

28:17.954 --> 28:20.121
had a contemporary look,

28:20.121 --> 28:22.021
Chef Ramsay designed
a menu to match.

28:22.021 --> 28:23.621
It's fresher, it's quicker,

28:23.621 --> 28:23.769
it's smaller,
and more importantly,

28:23.769 --> 28:25.188
it's smaller,
and more importantly,

28:25.188 --> 28:26.821
it's ten times
more exciting.

28:26.821 --> 28:28.421
The classic soups--
pasta e fagioli,

28:28.421 --> 28:29.821
minestrone soup.

28:29.821 --> 28:31.121
That's the heartbeat
of the restaurant.

28:31.121 --> 28:32.321
If this restaurant's got
a chance

28:32.321 --> 28:33.788
of survival,
we've got to communicate

28:33.788 --> 28:36.088
and stick together tonight.

28:36.088 --> 28:38.288
Right now, I'm so excited.

28:38.288 --> 28:40.254
I feel
like I'm 18 years old again.

28:40.254 --> 28:42.188
One, two, three,
Giuseppi's!

28:42.188 --> 28:46.188
On re-launch night...

28:46.188 --> 28:49.788
Hello! Welcome to the new
Giuseppi's trattoria.

28:51.421 --> 28:53.088
Everyone was feeling optimistic.

28:53.088 --> 28:53.769
I'm ready to rock and roll.

28:53.769 --> 28:55.121
I'm ready to rock and roll.

28:55.121 --> 28:57.088
But within an hour,

28:57.088 --> 28:58.921
Sam was buckling
under the pressure.

28:58.921 --> 28:59.954
What's wrong?
It's raw.

28:59.954 --> 29:01.221
Oh,.

29:01.221 --> 29:02.588
He and sous-chef Brian

29:02.588 --> 29:03.688
were falling behind.

29:03.688 --> 29:05.654
And their standards
started to drop.

29:05.654 --> 29:08.088
We waited an hour
for our food.

29:08.088 --> 29:10.188
Now I'm sitting here 20 minutes
waiting for raw fish?

29:10.188 --> 29:12.088
Making matters even worse,

29:12.088 --> 29:14.688
Brian was not taking
the re-launch seriously.

29:14.688 --> 29:15.821
♪ if I was rich

29:15.821 --> 29:17.288
I sure the hell
wouldn't be here.

29:18.854 --> 29:20.588
Chef Ramsay was having
none of that.

29:20.588 --> 29:22.254
Okay.

29:22.254 --> 29:23.754
And tried to get the kitchen
back on track.

29:23.754 --> 29:23.769
Sam, just quit
the  around.

29:23.769 --> 29:25.421
Sam, just quit
the  around.

29:25.421 --> 29:26.521
You'll see a difference
in the standard.

29:26.521 --> 29:27.488
Come on, guys.

29:27.488 --> 29:28.588
I know we can do better.

29:28.588 --> 29:29.954
, yeah,
we can do better.

29:29.954 --> 29:30.988
Well, come on.
Concentrate.

29:30.988 --> 29:32.154
Yes, Chef.

29:32.154 --> 29:33.488
But sous-chef Brian,

29:33.488 --> 29:34.654
clearly set in his ways,

29:34.654 --> 29:36.154
couldn't take
the criticism.

29:36.154 --> 29:38.154
You know who I blame?
I blame all this on you.

29:40.021 --> 29:41.088
It's not difficult.

29:41.088 --> 29:42.088
Just stop making

29:42.088 --> 29:44.121
pathetic excuses.

29:44.121 --> 29:45.188
Get back
in your  truck.

29:45.188 --> 29:46.121
Right.

29:46.121 --> 29:47.321
Coming to me
looking for excuses.

29:47.321 --> 29:48.788
Excuses.
I ain't got no excuses.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.288
You just said
you blame me.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.354
We did--
on the
when I first arrived.

29:52.354 --> 29:53.769
That's cool.
Thanks, Chef.

29:53.769 --> 29:54.121
That's cool.
Thanks, Chef.

29:54.121 --> 29:57.021
- Huh?
- What a  idiot.

29:59.021 --> 30:00.921
Where's Brian?

30:00.921 --> 30:03.254
With re-launch night
heading towards disaster,

30:03.254 --> 30:06.121
Joe returned to the kitchen
to support his son.

30:06.121 --> 30:07.521
Come on.
I'm not giving up.

30:07.521 --> 30:08.688
I'm not  giving up.

30:08.688 --> 30:10.154
All right, Sam.

30:10.154 --> 30:12.754
A couple of marsalas
coming right now.

30:12.754 --> 30:14.621
And for the first time,

30:14.621 --> 30:16.354
father and son worked
harmoniously as a team.

30:16.354 --> 30:17.754
And the night was saved.

30:17.754 --> 30:19.154
The salmon is delicious.
Yeah.

30:19.154 --> 30:20.254
You have
to try this.

30:20.254 --> 30:21.288
It is so good.
Delicious.

30:21.288 --> 30:22.254
I like that a lot.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.769
Okay, you did
an excellent job today, Sam.

30:23.769 --> 30:25.088
Okay, you did
an excellent job today, Sam.

30:26.521 --> 30:29.154
But before Chef Ramsay
would say good-bye,

30:29.154 --> 30:32.421
There was one more thing
he wanted to do.

30:32.421 --> 30:34.088
I asked all of you
to write a letter,

30:34.088 --> 30:36.521
and, before I go,

30:36.521 --> 30:38.954
I want you to read
a letter.

30:38.954 --> 30:39.954
Kathy.

30:39.954 --> 30:42.954
Joe, please try to trust

30:42.954 --> 30:44.488
in Sam.

30:44.488 --> 30:46.354
You need to teach
and support him.

30:46.354 --> 30:48.288
You need to let him
make mistakes.

30:48.288 --> 30:50.121
You need to pull back.

30:50.121 --> 30:51.654
Dear Dad,

30:51.654 --> 30:52.654
I really, truly
only want you

30:52.654 --> 30:53.769
to be proud of me.

30:53.769 --> 30:54.854
to be proud of me.

30:54.854 --> 30:57.654
I really am sorry
if I disappointed you

30:57.654 --> 31:00.421
and even more sorry
if I hurt you.

31:00.421 --> 31:01.354
I love you, Dad.

31:01.354 --> 31:02.488
Amazing.

31:02.488 --> 31:04.154
To Sam,

31:04.154 --> 31:06.121
you made me realize

31:06.121 --> 31:07.854
how important you are
to me.

31:07.854 --> 31:12.254
And I came to realize

31:12.254 --> 31:14.188
that you are ready.

31:14.188 --> 31:16.154
I want you
to take charge.

31:17.188 --> 31:20.521
P.S. I never stopped loving you.

31:20.521 --> 31:23.769
And I will be there for you
no matter what happens.

31:23.769 --> 31:26.154
And I will be there for you
no matter what happens.

31:26.154 --> 31:29.288
Love, your dad.

31:35.521 --> 31:38.754
You're an amazing family.

31:38.754 --> 31:42.121
You've just forgotten it.

31:42.121 --> 31:43.788
Now it's time to see

31:43.788 --> 31:46.254
How the family
is doing today.

31:46.254 --> 31:48.288
I'm back at Giuseppi's,

31:48.288 --> 31:49.821
Macomb township, Michigan,

31:49.821 --> 31:51.621
a family-run Italian restaurant.

31:51.621 --> 31:53.154
And the only problem
was the family

31:53.154 --> 31:53.769
were at war
with each other.

31:53.769 --> 31:54.654
were at war
with each other.

31:54.654 --> 31:57.154
The food was about as Italian
as a microwave pizza.

31:57.154 --> 32:00.154
Have they turned it around?
We're about to find out.

32:00.154 --> 32:01.688
Coming up...

32:01.688 --> 32:03.954
Kathy's heartbreaking news
gets to Chef Ramsay.

32:03.954 --> 32:05.954
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.

32:07.254 --> 32:09.254
And Sam reveals what life
with dad

32:09.254 --> 32:11.621
has been really like
since Gordon left.

32:11.621 --> 32:13.988
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.
My dad's my dad.

32:13.988 --> 32:16.321
Plus, we'll show you
the three biggest arguments

32:16.321 --> 32:18.621
in Kitchen Nightmares history.

32:18.621 --> 32:20.088
Chef Gordon,
where the  are ya?

32:20.088 --> 32:23.254
And one doesn't even involve
Chef Ramsay.

32:26.454 --> 32:29.154
All this when Kitchen Nightmares
continues.

32:32.553 --> 32:33.986
Kitchen Nightmareshas seen
its share of arguments,

32:33.986 --> 32:35.419
But we've selected
the three

32:35.419 --> 32:37.186
biggest blow-ups.

32:37.186 --> 32:38.753
We begin with number three,

32:38.753 --> 32:42.752
which took place at Peter's
in Babylon, New York,

32:42.752 --> 32:45.052
where Peter took his anger out,

32:45.052 --> 32:49.085
not on Chef Ramsay,
but on a bill collector.

32:49.085 --> 32:51.052
Oh,.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.418
Come on, you.

32:52.418 --> 32:54.385
- Go ahead, tough guy.
- Come on, you.

32:54.385 --> 32:56.318
Look, my father.

32:56.318 --> 32:58.352
Come on.
Come on.

32:58.352 --> 32:59.885
You made a mistake.

32:59.885 --> 33:00.816
I'll hurt you,
you scum bag.

33:00.816 --> 33:01.318
I'll hurt you,
you scum bag.

33:01.318 --> 33:03.352
Go ahead, tough guy.
Go ahead.

33:03.352 --> 33:05.333
Right now.
Right now.

33:05.333 --> 33:06.967
Number two goes
to Sebastian's

33:06.967 --> 33:08.133
in Burbank, California,

33:08.133 --> 33:10.133
where this owner had trouble
facing the truth.

33:10.133 --> 33:13.200
I've never, ever, ever,

33:13.200 --> 33:15.167
ever met someone

33:15.167 --> 33:17.700
I believe in
as little as you.

33:17.700 --> 33:20.633
And he literally chased
Chef Ramsay down.

33:20.633 --> 33:24.567
Chef Gordon!

33:24.567 --> 33:27.200
Chef Gordon,
where the  are you?

33:27.200 --> 33:29.233
Where are you?

33:29.233 --> 33:30.816
I'm here.
You come into my restaurant.

33:30.816 --> 33:31.233
I'm here.
You come into my restaurant.

33:31.233 --> 33:33.567
- Yes.
-  I'm just so  disappointed...

33:33.567 --> 33:35.133
You're gonna calm down.

33:35.133 --> 33:36.300
Stop pointing your finger
at me.

33:36.300 --> 33:38.233
You're gonna calm down.
Are we gonna speak like men?

33:38.233 --> 33:39.400
You're gonna speak
to me like a man?

33:39.400 --> 33:41.200
You didn't listen--

33:41.200 --> 33:42.200
You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.533
Did you just hear
what I just told you?

33:44.533 --> 33:45.700
I'm stepping away from you

33:45.700 --> 33:47.200
'cause I don't want
to be too close.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.633
You ungrateful...
You have no idea.

33:48.633 --> 33:51.400
- Nasty, vindictive joker.
- You have no  idea.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.700
you.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.633
And the number one spot goes

33:54.633 --> 33:56.400
to secret garden
in Moorpark, California,

33:56.400 --> 33:59.667
where Gordon had seen enough
of owner Michel's antics.

34:02.233 --> 34:03.933
- What?
-  No, I'm not telling no.

34:03.933 --> 34:06.200
I'm telling you how--
get straight to the
answer.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.200
Let me finish.

34:10.200 --> 34:11.633
Don't put your  hands up
there, listen to me.

34:11.633 --> 34:13.000
You work
like a pig.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.167
You  pig!

34:14.167 --> 34:15.233
You're not happy?

34:15.233 --> 34:16.800
I'm  happy.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.167
You can get out.
Go on.

34:18.167 --> 34:19.833
- You can get out.
- yourself.

34:19.833 --> 34:20.833
- You can get out.
- It's my  kitchen.

34:20.833 --> 34:22.000
Yeah, is it?

34:22.000 --> 34:23.033
Well, if it's
your  kitchen,

34:23.033 --> 34:24.300
Then clean it,
you lazy!

34:24.300 --> 34:27.167
No!

34:27.167 --> 34:29.333
There was plenty of fighting
going on

34:29.333 --> 34:30.816
At Giuseppi's family-run
restaurant,

34:30.816 --> 34:31.300
At Giuseppi's family-run
restaurant,

34:31.300 --> 34:33.967
but they weren't taking on
Chef Ramsay.

34:33.967 --> 34:35.500
They were battling
each other.

34:35.500 --> 34:36.867
I've been
doing that

34:36.867 --> 34:38.833
Since I was  13
next to you.

34:38.833 --> 34:40.333
You don't see me?
See what, Sam?

34:40.333 --> 34:41.333
It took tough love

34:41.333 --> 34:42.467
And plenty of tears,

34:42.467 --> 34:44.467
but Chef Ramsay managed

34:44.467 --> 34:46.333
to turn this place around
and bring

34:46.333 --> 34:47.467
a family back together.

34:47.467 --> 34:48.967
I never stopped loving you.

34:48.967 --> 34:52.200
And I'll be there for you

34:52.200 --> 34:53.167
no matter what happens.

34:53.167 --> 34:54.467
Love, your dad.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.733
Now, one year later,

34:56.733 --> 34:58.067
Gordon's back.

35:00.067 --> 35:00.816
Giuseppi's was very close
to my heart.

35:00.816 --> 35:02.333
Giuseppi's was very close
to my heart.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.733
When I got here, the restaurant
was in a complete mess.

35:04.733 --> 35:06.967
Before I could
start fixing that,

35:06.967 --> 35:08.533
I had to repair
something much more important,

35:08.533 --> 35:10.200
and that was the relationship
between a father and a son.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.733
It's a year later,
and I hope

35:11.733 --> 35:14.300
they're not back
to their old fighting ways.

35:14.300 --> 35:15.467
Please, God.

35:15.467 --> 35:17.167
Hello.

35:17.167 --> 35:18.500
Look at you two.

35:18.500 --> 35:19.500
Mwah. Mwah.

35:19.500 --> 35:20.967
Good to see you.

35:20.967 --> 35:22.000
How are you,
my darling?

35:22.000 --> 35:23.200
I'm good.
You look great.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.300
It was good to see Ramsay.
He always makes me excited.

35:25.300 --> 35:27.333
How are you, sir?
Good to see you.

35:27.333 --> 35:28.633
It was great
to see Gordon again.

35:28.633 --> 35:30.816
I mean, he truly loves
our family.

35:30.816 --> 35:31.333
I mean, he truly loves
our family.

35:31.333 --> 35:33.133
It's busy,
which is good news.

35:33.133 --> 35:35.133
Um, more importantly,
how have you been?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.300
Good.
Well, up and down.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.467
You know, like the economy here
in Michigan is bad.

35:39.467 --> 35:41.300
And we tried to hold down
our own, you know.

35:41.300 --> 35:43.200
So who's in charge
of the kitchen?

35:43.200 --> 35:44.633
Sam.
Sam.

35:44.633 --> 35:46.333
Brilliant.
Have you left him in charge?

35:46.333 --> 35:47.333
Or are you interfering?
No, no.

35:47.333 --> 35:49.467
I interfere
in a point

35:49.467 --> 35:52.400
where if it gets backed up...
What?

35:52.400 --> 35:54.067
Some things never change.

35:54.067 --> 35:56.167
Why don't we ever have towels
in this line?

35:56.167 --> 35:57.200
There's a towel
right there.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.400
I wouldn't even wipe
my ass with that.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.533
There's towels right there.

35:59.533 --> 36:00.633
There's a towel down here.

36:00.633 --> 36:00.816
All right, well,
I'm gonna quickly go

36:00.816 --> 36:01.667
All right, well,
I'm gonna quickly go

36:01.667 --> 36:03.100
and see the man, yeah?

36:03.100 --> 36:04.100
Okay.
Right. I'll catch up
with you in a minute.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.300
Where is he?

36:08.300 --> 36:10.300
This is some of the best salmon
I've ever had.

36:10.300 --> 36:11.867
Hey, big boy.

36:11.867 --> 36:13.333
Hey.
How are you?

36:13.333 --> 36:15.333
So I saw Chef Ramsay poke
his head in there,

36:15.333 --> 36:16.567
and, you know, I just wanted
to almost jump

36:16.567 --> 36:18.133
through the window
and give him a big hug.

36:18.133 --> 36:19.800
Absolutely.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.333
Good to see you.
Great to see you.

36:21.333 --> 36:23.233
And where's--
where's Brian?

36:23.233 --> 36:25.200
- Brian?
- Yeah, no.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.200
Gone.
Gone.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.567
Thank  for that.

36:27.567 --> 36:29.833
Yeah, he's nothing
but trouble.

36:29.833 --> 36:30.816
Now, Dad,
is he on your case?

36:30.816 --> 36:31.033
Now, Dad,
is he on your case?

36:31.033 --> 36:32.833
Is he...
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.

36:32.833 --> 36:34.233
My dad's my dad.

36:34.233 --> 36:35.400
When was the last time
he paid you a compliment?

36:35.400 --> 36:37.867
Actually, two days ago.

36:37.867 --> 36:39.333
That's great news.
Yeah, yeah.

36:39.333 --> 36:40.500
So he's getting better
through age.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.200
I find it a lot easier now

36:42.200 --> 36:43.733
to be able to talk to my dad.

36:43.733 --> 36:45.667
Four picantes
and one Marsala

36:45.667 --> 36:46.967
are ready to go out.

36:46.967 --> 36:49.733
It's a lot easier,
I guess, to open up

36:49.733 --> 36:50.967
and share each other's feelings.

36:50.967 --> 36:52.067
How many times
a day

36:52.067 --> 36:53.633
are you using
the microwave?

36:53.633 --> 36:54.900
Very, very rare.

36:54.900 --> 36:57.133
I've been keeping
the standard

36:57.133 --> 36:59.467
as high as Chef Ramsay's
standard would be.

36:59.467 --> 37:00.816
I'm dying
to taste your food.

37:00.816 --> 37:01.700
I'm dying
to taste your food.

37:01.700 --> 37:03.767
All right.
I'm dying to make you something.

37:03.767 --> 37:04.900
Good to see you,
buddy.

37:04.900 --> 37:06.033
Thank you.
Great to see you.

37:06.033 --> 37:08.233
Okay, likewise.
Thank you, sir.

37:08.233 --> 37:10.467
Let's have a catch-up.

37:10.467 --> 37:11.833
Really good
to see you, darling.

37:11.833 --> 37:13.033
Thank you.
Take it from the top.

37:13.033 --> 37:14.667
What happened
after I left?

37:14.667 --> 37:16.167
We boomed.
I mean, we boomed.

37:16.167 --> 37:17.633
Yeah.

37:17.633 --> 37:18.567
Reservations every night.
It was great.

37:18.567 --> 37:19.567
It was really good.

37:19.567 --> 37:21.133
Come January, we just tanked.

37:21.133 --> 37:22.667
Yeah.

37:22.667 --> 37:23.733
I mean, I have customers
coming in and out all the time.

37:23.733 --> 37:24.900
You know, "I'm sorry.
We miss you.

37:24.900 --> 37:26.233
But we're laid off."

37:26.233 --> 37:28.667
I have never seen the economy
like this.

37:28.667 --> 37:29.800
How's Joe been?

37:29.800 --> 37:30.816
He had a little complication

37:30.816 --> 37:31.333
He had a little complication

37:31.333 --> 37:32.567
due to the diabetes.

37:32.567 --> 37:34.233
But he battled back.
I'm proud of him.

37:34.233 --> 37:35.167
He's stronger
than I thought.

37:35.167 --> 37:37.667
I'm scared of the diabetes.

37:37.667 --> 37:41.133
I'm scared that my husband's
only 55

37:41.133 --> 37:43.533
and may look older than that.

37:43.533 --> 37:45.333
I'm scared that he won't be able
to enjoy

37:45.333 --> 37:46.700
his retirement some day.

37:46.700 --> 37:48.367
I'm scared.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.300
And the relationship
between Joe

37:50.300 --> 37:52.133
and Sam?
excellent.

37:52.133 --> 37:54.533
I mean, it came
from nothing,

37:54.533 --> 37:55.900
almost no relationship,

37:55.900 --> 37:57.900
to a solid father-son
relationship.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.467
Sam doesn't live
with us now,

37:59.467 --> 38:00.816
so it's nice.
it's better.

38:00.816 --> 38:01.333
so it's nice.
it's better.

38:01.333 --> 38:02.333
Now who lives
at home?

38:02.333 --> 38:05.200
Just me and Joe.
Just you and Joe.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.233
For a couple more weeks.

38:06.233 --> 38:07.833
What do you mean
for a couple more weeks?

38:07.833 --> 38:10.167
It's gone.
We lost the house.

38:11.899 --> 38:13.966
So we need to find
a place to live.

38:13.966 --> 38:16.066
I'm sorry, darling.
That's okay.

38:16.066 --> 38:18.900
That's okay.
Really, I can sleep anywhere.

38:18.900 --> 38:21.133
Yeah.
So...they foreclosed.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.466
We have
a few more weeks.

38:23.466 --> 38:24.600
And then I need
to find a place to go.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.599
Kathy,.

38:26.599 --> 38:28.699
When I told him
about being homeless

38:28.699 --> 38:30.233
in a few weeks,

38:30.233 --> 38:30.816
I actually saw a tear
in his eye.

38:30.816 --> 38:32.199
I actually saw a tear
in his eye.

38:32.199 --> 38:34.699
Like he really,
truly cared.

38:34.699 --> 38:36.533
I've never met a woman

38:36.533 --> 38:38.433
as strong as you,
involved in this business.

38:38.433 --> 38:41.133
And you are a rock, and the
family depend on that rock,

38:41.133 --> 38:42.733
and you'll bounce back.

38:42.733 --> 38:43.899
And I know
you'll get that house back.

38:43.899 --> 38:44.933
Oh, I will.
Oh, I will.

38:44.933 --> 38:45.966
I'll cry a day,

38:45.966 --> 38:47.399
and life goes on.
Yeah.

38:47.399 --> 38:49.866
The only source

38:49.866 --> 38:50.899
of income

38:50.899 --> 38:52.733
that we have
in the Detroit area

38:52.733 --> 38:55.133
is the automobile industry.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.299
So that goes down,

38:57.299 --> 38:59.766
everybody around the area
goes down.

38:59.766 --> 39:00.816
So, yeah,
it's really, really bad.

39:00.816 --> 39:01.799
So, yeah,
it's really, really bad.

39:01.799 --> 39:03.833
Hold on to this here.

39:03.833 --> 39:04.799
Yeah?
This is stabilized.

39:04.799 --> 39:06.033
As long as I can.

39:06.033 --> 39:08.466
It really hurts to watch
your parents struggle.

39:08.466 --> 39:10.599
These are the people
that worked

39:10.599 --> 39:13.699
their asses off
for their whole life, you know,

39:13.699 --> 39:16.366
and they don't have nothing
to show for it.

39:16.366 --> 39:18.133
It sucks.

39:18.133 --> 39:21.799
Next, the Borgia Family
has a surprise

39:21.799 --> 39:23.866
in store for Chef Ramsay.

39:23.866 --> 39:27.733
And Gordon returns the favor
with a surprise of his own.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.699
I'm in shock.
You're in shock.

39:29.699 --> 39:30.816
All this
when this special edition

39:30.816 --> 39:31.799
All this
when this special edition

39:31.799 --> 39:33.799
of Kitchen Nightmares
continues.

39:36.612 --> 39:38.512
Just one year ago,

39:38.512 --> 39:40.145
this family
was in a constant battle.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.512
Where's your fire
in your belly?

39:41.512 --> 39:44.978
But now, even with the economy

39:44.978 --> 39:46.278
weighing heavily
on Giuseppi's,

39:46.278 --> 39:47.978
Joe, Sam, and Kathy

39:47.978 --> 39:50.312
are closer than ever.

39:50.312 --> 39:52.278
Looking at what you were like
this time

39:52.278 --> 39:54.712
a year ago,
how emotionally

39:54.712 --> 39:56.812
distraught it was,
fragmented--

39:56.812 --> 39:58.612
rottweiler one side,

39:58.612 --> 39:59.945
your son the other side...

39:59.945 --> 40:01.378
A year ago,
I was afraid

40:01.378 --> 40:03.178
to leave them
in the same room together.

40:03.178 --> 40:04.939
I was afraid
there'd be bloodshed.

40:04.939 --> 40:05.212
I was afraid
there'd be bloodshed.

40:05.212 --> 40:07.645
As long as we're together,
nothing else matters.

40:07.645 --> 40:08.845
Who made those?

40:08.845 --> 40:11.512
Sam.
It's crab and shrimp tortellini.

40:11.512 --> 40:12.978
Wow.

40:12.978 --> 40:14.612
That is delicious.

40:14.612 --> 40:15.845
Good.

40:15.845 --> 40:17.478
In your eyes now,
is he a cook

40:17.478 --> 40:18.812
or is he a chef?
he's a chef.

40:18.812 --> 40:20.012
He's definitely a chef.

40:20.012 --> 40:21.345
Food like that.

40:21.345 --> 40:22.978
And what's this?

40:22.978 --> 40:25.612
This is the stuffed pork chop,
my father's recipe.

40:25.612 --> 40:28.345
With roasted Rosemary
red skins

40:28.345 --> 40:30.312
and a fresh vegetable
medley.

40:30.312 --> 40:31.812
I'm being spoiled here.

40:31.812 --> 40:34.712
Last year,
best and worst moments.

40:34.712 --> 40:34.939
I think the worst moment
when you were here last time

40:34.939 --> 40:38.712
I think the worst moment
when you were here last time

40:38.712 --> 40:40.278
is when my father got frustrated

40:40.278 --> 40:41.478
because the orders
were coming back

40:41.478 --> 40:44.278
and he told me
to get off my station.

40:44.278 --> 40:46.345
Don't touch his steak.

40:46.345 --> 40:48.378
What the hell?

40:48.378 --> 40:49.712
Sam, get your ass
out of there.

40:51.712 --> 40:54.612
But the best...

40:56.945 --> 40:59.112
No, when you asked him
if he was expediting.

40:59.112 --> 41:01.645
And he said...
No, not really.

41:01.645 --> 41:03.378
I can't read
without my glasses.

41:03.378 --> 41:04.245
Your glasses around your neck.

41:08.978 --> 41:10.345
And best moment?

41:10.345 --> 41:12.312
Probably the letters
'cause it was genuine.

41:12.312 --> 41:13.312
And it was from the heart.

41:13.312 --> 41:14.712
Much needed.

41:14.712 --> 41:17.145
Dear Dad,
I really, truly only want you

41:17.145 --> 41:19.312
to be proud of me.

41:19.312 --> 41:21.812
I really am sorry
if I disappointed you

41:21.812 --> 41:24.778
and even more sorry
if I hurt you.

41:24.778 --> 41:26.045
I love you, Dad.

41:26.045 --> 41:28.178
You know, we got together
as a family.

41:28.178 --> 41:29.478
You know,
that was the best thing.

41:29.478 --> 41:30.478
Now a little surprise.

41:30.478 --> 41:32.278
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
can I just have

41:32.278 --> 41:33.778
your attention
for 30 seconds?

41:33.778 --> 41:34.939
I'm gonna welcome now
two very important gentlemen,

41:34.939 --> 41:35.445
I'm gonna welcome now
two very important gentlemen,

41:35.445 --> 41:37.012
please, yes.

41:37.012 --> 41:38.812
From the Italian-American
Chamber of Commerce

41:38.812 --> 41:41.312
to present to the family
of Giuseppi's

41:41.312 --> 41:43.378
a plaque, please.

41:43.378 --> 41:44.645
Gentlemen.

41:44.645 --> 41:46.478
In recognition
of your commitment

41:46.478 --> 41:48.345
to honor the Italian heritage,

41:48.345 --> 41:50.278
we're pleased to present
this plaque to you.

41:50.278 --> 41:51.312
Excellent!

41:51.312 --> 41:53.678
Thank you.

41:53.678 --> 41:58.145
For authentic Italian cuisine.

41:58.145 --> 42:00.845
Well, I felt, you know, like
somebody got a Golden Globe,

42:00.845 --> 42:01.945
you know?

42:01.945 --> 42:03.212
A little speech?

42:03.212 --> 42:04.939
Well, I'm in shock.

42:04.939 --> 42:05.278
Well, I'm in shock.

42:05.278 --> 42:07.445
You're in shock.

42:07.445 --> 42:08.812
First, you come in,
you tell me like my food.

42:08.812 --> 42:10.878
It's an honor.
Thank you.

42:10.878 --> 42:13.478
I'll treasure this
the rest of my life.

42:13.478 --> 42:15.445
It was nice for me
to see him beam

42:15.445 --> 42:17.012
and shine and be proud.

42:17.012 --> 42:18.345
Excellent.
Well done, my darling.

42:18.345 --> 42:20.478
Come here.

42:20.478 --> 42:24.178
The single most important thing
that Gordon did was to get

42:24.178 --> 42:26.378
my son and my husband
on the same page,

42:26.378 --> 42:27.945
respecting each other,

42:27.945 --> 42:29.478
loving each other,

42:29.478 --> 42:31.612
that he gave them a relationship
they were lacking.

42:31.612 --> 42:34.939
Gordon taught me, you know,
that family is--is everything.

42:34.939 --> 42:35.778
Gordon taught me, you know,
that family is--is everything.

42:35.778 --> 42:38.045
So, even if we don't have
the house

42:38.045 --> 42:39.345
and maybe some day we don't have
the restaurant,

42:39.345 --> 42:41.378
we got the family.

42:41.378 --> 42:43.212
We have the strength.

42:43.212 --> 42:45.945
Only a month
after Gordon's visit,

42:45.945 --> 42:49.111
the Borgias decided
to close down Giuseppi's.

42:49.111 --> 42:51.845
The bad economic times,
especially in Michigan,

42:51.845 --> 42:53.311
made it difficult to keep
the restaurant afloat.

42:53.311 --> 42:55.545
The Borgias plan on looking

42:55.545 --> 42:58.278
for new opportunities
once the economy improves

42:58.278 --> 42:59.445
in Michigan.

42:59.445 --> 43:01.312
And although Giuseppi's
is no longer in business,

43:01.312 --> 43:04.345
they will always be grateful
to Chef Ramsay

43:04.345 --> 43:04.939
for it's because of him
this family's bond

43:04.939 --> 43:07.611
for it's because of him
this family's bond

43:07.611 --> 43:10.518
and love for each other
is stronger than ever.
