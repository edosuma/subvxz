My only possession!

01:18.195 --> 01:19.896
I don't know where to start here.

01:19.930 --> 01:22.048
Look at you two.
Best case scenario:

01:22.082 --> 01:23.922
you're telling me
you're gay with each other.

01:23.923 --> 01:24.850
Gay?

01:24.885 --> 01:27.019
We're about as far
from gay as you can be.

01:27.054 --> 01:28.754
Mr. Smith, if I may?

01:28.789 --> 01:31.691
Air guitar is aerobic,
encourages coordination,

01:31.725 --> 01:34.927
and coaxes a pretty good amount
of laughter out of the two of us

01:34.962 --> 01:37.430
which we all know
is good for the ticker.

01:38.665 --> 01:40.266
Get off my land.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.268
And a good day to you, sir.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.804
He's just walking home in that.

01:44.838 --> 01:47.673
Where's a rock?
I'm gonna throw a rock at him.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.123
(thud) (grunt)

01:49.124 --> 01:51.244
Steve, you need to stop
hanging out with that loser.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.029
What? No way!

01:53.063 --> 01:54.430
He's my best friend!

01:54.448 --> 01:56.732
And I'll give you
five solid reasons why.

01:56.767 --> 02:00.386
He's sensible, thoughtful,
political, hilarious,

02:00.420 --> 02:02.939
and he always covers his mouth
when he sneezes.

02:02.973 --> 02:05.308
You get him sick,
he doesn't get you sick.

02:05.342 --> 02:07.627
Steve, I forbid you to see him again.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.946
Now take off those pants
and put on some normal clothes.

Kid's got his mother's ass.

Roger, thanks for letting me

02:25.479 --> 02:27.196
clean your place for the extra cash.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.982
No problem.
Here's your 50 bucks, kiddo.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.457
Oh, and here's some old sweatshirts.

02:31.458 --> 02:32.818
And one shoe.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.487
I don't have the other one.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.138
So, I don't know if you still...

02:36.156 --> 02:37.089
Is nice.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.075
I take.

02:45.132 --> 02:47.149
Gimme your money!

(both giggling)

03:03.850 --> 03:05.968
(laughing) Oh, stop!

03:06.003 --> 03:07.970
This is ridiculous.
This is exactly why

03:08.005 --> 03:10.072
I told Steve to stop hanging out
with that kid.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.841
But, Stan, you can't break them up.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.109
They're best friends.

03:13.143 --> 03:14.777
So?
So...

03:14.811 --> 03:17.346
Didn't you have a best friend
when you were Steve's age?

03:17.381 --> 03:21.417
Oh, my God, you didn't.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.453
Francine, 12-year-old girls
have best friends.

03:24.488 --> 03:26.822
Little boys can only be
best friends with dragons.

03:26.857 --> 03:29.158
If you try and keep
Steve and Snot apart,

03:29.192 --> 03:31.427
they're just going to hang out
behind your back.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.630
Well, then, I'll have to think
of a way to keep them apart.

03:37.367 --> 03:39.919
(scoffs) Those kids love being topless.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.154
FRANCINE:
That patch of hair

03:42.189 --> 03:45.758
in the small of Snot's back
makes me sick.

03:48.044 --> 03:49.261
Hey, Snot!

03:49.312 --> 03:51.180
Oh, hey, Mr. Smith.

03:51.214 --> 03:52.334
Listen, I was a little harsh

03:52.335 --> 03:53.655
with you and Steve in the garage.

03:53.656 --> 03:55.184
Thought I could make it up to you.

03:55.218 --> 03:57.570
You like ice cream?
I do like ice cream.

03:57.604 --> 04:00.740
Unfortunately, it does not like me.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.526
It gives me the (honking).

04:03.560 --> 04:05.211
You'll power through.

04:07.714 --> 04:10.783
I like coffee ice cream,

04:10.817 --> 04:13.519
but I don't like coffee.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.521
I mean, what do you think?

04:15.555 --> 04:18.089
Could that be a joke for Jerry Seinfeld?

04:18.125 --> 04:20.910
Hey, uh...
I gotta hit the head.

04:28.118 --> 04:29.485
(children scream)

04:29.519 --> 04:31.921
Mr. Capelli says hello.

04:34.474 --> 04:37.593
No witnesses.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.430
That guy saw your face!

04:41.448 --> 04:42.608
They're gonna come after you!

04:42.609 --> 04:44.116
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

04:44.151 --> 04:45.871
You can't go home.
They'll find you there.

04:45.902 --> 04:49.071
We gotta get you into the
CIA witness protection program!

04:52.542 --> 04:55.311
What do you think Stan's gonna
give us for doing this?

04:55.345 --> 04:57.046
I'm hoping a new set of corn holders.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.148
I've almost worn out
the last ones he gave us.

04:59.182 --> 05:00.416
Really?

05:00.450 --> 05:02.251
Wow, you love corn.
I do!

05:02.285 --> 05:03.686
But you don't like touching it.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.321
I do not.

05:07.858 --> 05:09.759
(phone rings)

05:09.793 --> 05:11.761
"Unknown number?"

05:11.795 --> 05:14.530
Hmm. Be careful, Steve.
These calls can be dicey.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.731
(phone ringing)

05:15.766 --> 05:17.867
Let's see if I can... whoo...

05:17.901 --> 05:19.602
...navigate this.

05:19.636 --> 05:21.203
(deep voice):
Hello?

05:21.238 --> 05:22.855
Steve, it's me, Snot.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.590
Snot! Unknown number?

05:24.624 --> 05:25.858
W-W-What's going on?

05:25.892 --> 05:29.195
Listen, I have something to tell you.

05:29.229 --> 05:31.697
I moved to Cheyenne.
You moved?!

05:31.731 --> 05:34.033
My mom liked the license plates.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.367
They have a cowboy on them.

05:35.402 --> 05:37.219
But the carnival's this weekend.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.388
We always go to the carnival!

05:39.422 --> 05:41.557
Sorry, Steve.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.125
So when am I gonna see you again?

05:43.160 --> 05:44.794
(emotionally):
I don't...

05:44.828 --> 05:46.629
I gotta go.

05:46.663 --> 05:48.097
Good cover, kid.

05:48.131 --> 05:50.065
That crying bit
was top-notch.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.095
What did you think
about to make you cry?

05:52.215 --> 05:54.787
Never seeing Steve again.
(sniffles)

05:54.821 --> 05:57.359
You know what I think
about to make me cry?

05:57.953 --> 06:00.926
(emotionally): How Ron Howard
looks like Clint Howard now.

06:06.723 --> 06:09.859
All right, so if I'm gonna live here

06:09.893 --> 06:11.681
and start a whole new life,

06:11.682 --> 06:12.922
tell me about the neighborhood.

06:13.042 --> 06:15.197
Donuts and jazz, where do I go?

06:15.232 --> 06:16.799
You don't.
You're in hiding.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.073
You never leave this apartment.

06:18.074 --> 06:21.423
If anyone comes to the door,
your name is Sven Norqvist.

06:21.458 --> 06:23.592
Here, put this wig on.

06:23.626 --> 06:25.778
I always wanted blonde hair.

06:25.812 --> 06:28.280
Do I look like Rolf
from <i>The Sound of Music?</i>

06:28.314 --> 06:30.949
Yeah...
I-I don't know, kid.

06:30.984 --> 06:32.151
The fridge is full of food.

06:32.185 --> 06:33.936
I'll be back in a week to check on you.

06:33.970 --> 06:35.771
Don't I need to tell
my mother about this?

06:35.805 --> 06:37.423
Don't worry.
I took care of it.

06:38.458 --> 06:39.725
(beeps)

06:39.753 --> 06:40.793
STAN (as Snot):
Hey, Mom.

06:40.827 --> 06:42.828
Shalom. It's me, Snot.

06:42.862 --> 06:45.063
I got into NASA Medical School!

06:45.098 --> 06:47.800
If they have phones on Mars,
I'll call ya!

06:47.834 --> 06:49.802
Bye!

06:49.836 --> 06:52.638
My son, the astronaut doctor!

06:52.672 --> 06:55.541
Just like the psychic painted.

07:00.580 --> 07:02.815
Oh, my God.

07:02.849 --> 07:04.716
What happened to your face, honey?

07:04.751 --> 07:06.718
I got robbed in front of my room.

07:06.753 --> 07:08.954
They stole the 50 bucks you gave me.

07:08.988 --> 07:10.989
Oh, no, that's terrible!

07:11.024 --> 07:13.592
Hey, look at my new bracelet!
It jingles.

07:13.626 --> 07:15.727
(chuckling):
For 50 bucks, it better, right?

07:19.349 --> 07:21.967
Thanks for walking me home, Roger.

07:21.985 --> 07:23.986
We're safer in pairs.

07:25.371 --> 07:27.222
(yells)

07:27.257 --> 07:29.725
(choking)

07:32.479 --> 07:34.480
Eh. I don't have
time for this.

07:44.858 --> 07:46.458
Oh, Snot.

07:46.493 --> 07:49.344
You were wearing your bathing
suit as underwear that day.

07:51.163 --> 07:53.298
Oh, is that a letter for Snot?
I'll mail it for you.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.467
Thanks. This is my
fifth letter to him.

07:55.502 --> 07:57.469
I hope this time he writes me back.

07:57.504 --> 07:58.637
Doubt it.

07:58.671 --> 08:00.191
Snot's probably moved on with his life

08:00.192 --> 08:01.592
and I think it's time you did, too.

08:01.608 --> 08:03.575
Here, I signed you up for lacrosse.

08:03.610 --> 08:06.035
Dad, I am not a physical boy.

08:06.036 --> 08:07.996
Well, now that Snot's
not here to drag you down,

08:07.997 --> 08:08.797
you can do anything.

08:08.831 --> 08:10.911
Let's see what you can do
with that lacrosse stick.

08:13.102 --> 08:14.086
What are you doing?

08:14.120 --> 08:16.905
Playing lunch lady.
Pizza or sloppy joe?

08:16.940 --> 08:18.407
(sighs deeply)

08:18.441 --> 08:20.776
I am pissed off
because you're doing that,

08:20.810 --> 08:22.244
and now I want a sloppy joe

08:22.278 --> 08:24.179
and I know you don't really have one.

08:28.718 --> 08:29.851
(knocking)

08:32.755 --> 08:34.590
(mediocre Swedish accent):
I'm Sven.

08:34.624 --> 08:37.092
STAN:
It's me!

08:37.126 --> 08:38.860
Here's your groceries.
See you next week.

08:38.895 --> 08:40.261
Mr. Smith, wait!

08:40.296 --> 08:42.097
Want to stay for dinner?

08:42.131 --> 08:43.932
I made a casserole.

08:43.967 --> 08:45.984
I (bleep) love casserole.

08:47.453 --> 08:49.087
I think they'll go all the way to 17.

08:49.122 --> 08:52.491
17? <i>Ocean's 17?</i>

08:52.525 --> 08:54.725
Look, as long as that gang
likes hanging out together,

08:54.726 --> 08:56.406
they're gonna keep
making those pictures.

08:56.407 --> 08:58.297
I notice you call movies pictures.

08:58.331 --> 08:59.965
I do.
I do do that.

08:59.999 --> 09:01.900
I notice you just said doo doo.

09:01.935 --> 09:03.569
(laughs)

09:03.603 --> 09:04.970
Hilarious.

09:05.004 --> 09:09.007
Steve said you were hilarious,
and that... checks out.

09:11.277 --> 09:14.112
Well, I guess I better
be getting home, huh?

09:14.147 --> 09:16.114
You think you're okay to drive?

09:16.149 --> 09:17.382
Now that you mention it,

09:17.401 --> 09:19.401
I did have a couple of
glasses of wine at dinner.

09:20.270 --> 09:21.903
You should crash here.

09:21.938 --> 09:23.405
I mean, if you want.

09:23.439 --> 09:25.907
Sensible.
The boy is sensible.

09:25.942 --> 09:27.909
Not too sensible...

09:27.944 --> 09:30.596
(singsong):
I have crumb cake!

09:30.630 --> 09:32.631
(giggling)

09:34.100 --> 09:35.584
Okay. Ready?

09:35.618 --> 09:37.619
Ready-o!

09:37.654 --> 09:39.655
(Snot's feet patter,
sleeping bag rustles)

09:40.290 --> 09:41.290
(zipper zips)

09:45.628 --> 09:46.828
STAN:
You still up?

09:46.863 --> 09:48.764
SNOT:
Yeah. You?

09:48.798 --> 09:50.432
STAN:
I'm not even tired.

09:50.466 --> 09:52.467
SNOT:
Me neither.

09:53.970 --> 09:55.690
STAN: Hey, does this
building have a pool?

09:55.691 --> 09:57.606
SNOT:
Yeah, on the roof.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.608
STAN: We should totally
go swimming tomorrow.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.643
SNOT:
Totally.

10:03.313 --> 10:06.114
Oh, I finally took my socks off.

10:06.149 --> 10:08.069
STAN: Oh! I'm gonna do that.
I'm gonna do that.

10:08.070 --> 10:09.284
(rustling)

10:09.319 --> 10:11.320
Ahh, that is nice.

10:13.990 --> 10:16.625
How many people do you think
are having sex right now?

10:16.659 --> 10:19.628
SNOT:
In the city or the world?

10:19.662 --> 10:21.296
STAN:
World.

10:21.331 --> 10:23.965
SNOT:
Probably about 50.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.240
STAN:
Yeah, I think that, too.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.304
SNOT:
Hey, Stan?

10:29.339 --> 10:31.807
You think when we die,
we come back as something else?

10:31.841 --> 10:34.476
STAN: Oh, no, no. No, we
just get one go-round.

10:34.510 --> 10:37.312
One ticket per customer, my friend.

10:37.347 --> 10:39.314
SNOT: You think interest rates
are gonna go up?

10:39.349 --> 10:41.416
STAN: Come on, man.
That's grown-up stuff.

10:41.451 --> 10:43.151
Let's keep it light.

10:43.186 --> 10:45.253
SNOT:
So there's this girl at school,

10:45.288 --> 10:47.089
and she said she'd let me kiss her,

10:47.123 --> 10:48.990
but only on her butt cheek.

10:49.025 --> 10:50.826
Should I do it?

10:50.860 --> 10:52.327
STAN:
Yeah. Yeah, you should do it.

10:52.362 --> 10:54.663
SNOT:
Good, 'cause I already did.

10:58.034 --> 10:59.868
STAN:
My pillow is so hot.

10:59.902 --> 11:01.336
SNOT:
Turn it over.

11:01.371 --> 11:03.451
STAN: I'm saving it for
right before I fall asleep.

11:03.452 --> 11:05.307
SNOT:
Yeah, that's smart.

11:11.981 --> 11:13.615
STAN:
You asleep yet?

11:13.649 --> 11:15.650
SNOT:
No.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.489
STAN: I can't wait to
go swimming tomorrow.

11:22.592 --> 11:25.093
Chicken pot pie?

11:25.128 --> 11:28.530
Chicken pot bye!

11:28.564 --> 11:30.799
Oh, no!
You got robbed again!

11:30.833 --> 11:32.167
And almost raped.

11:32.201 --> 11:33.652
(chuckles):
Almost.

11:33.686 --> 11:36.054
Jeff, at least use
that scooter to get home.

11:36.089 --> 11:38.490
Just speed through that
hallway and get home safe.

11:38.524 --> 11:40.525
Okay. Thanks, Roger.

11:41.694 --> 11:44.246
Okay, I'm just gonna wash my hands now.

11:45.348 --> 11:47.315
(door closes)

11:47.350 --> 11:48.850
(sniffs)

11:55.625 --> 11:56.942
(tires screech)

11:56.976 --> 11:59.111
W-Was this light always here?

11:59.145 --> 12:00.612
(bell dings)

12:01.798 --> 12:03.432
(fierce yell) (grunts)

12:04.467 --> 12:06.718
Help! Carjacking!

12:06.753 --> 12:08.587
(groans)

12:12.942 --> 12:15.243
Shredded it!

12:15.278 --> 12:19.247
STEVE: <i>And now, lacrosse
champion, Steve Smith! Yay!</i>

12:19.282 --> 12:21.633
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Steady, steady. Whoa!

12:29.008 --> 12:30.375
What the hell?!

12:30.409 --> 12:31.576
What's wrong?

12:31.611 --> 12:34.212
Dad never mailed these
letters I wrote to Snot!

12:34.247 --> 12:37.466
Wait. And you said Snot just up
and left town one night?

12:37.500 --> 12:38.633
Yeah...

12:38.668 --> 12:40.469
(sighs) Come with me.

12:40.503 --> 12:43.572
Here are letters I wrote
that I found in Dad's desk.

12:43.606 --> 12:46.541
See, back in high school
I-I went on a couple of dates

12:46.576 --> 12:48.076
with a black guy, and...
Oh!

12:48.110 --> 12:49.377
Dad didn't like him.

12:49.412 --> 12:51.546
So he had Darnell witness a fake murder,

12:51.581 --> 12:53.648
then made up some bogus
witness protection thing,

12:53.683 --> 12:55.851
and hid him in some apartment
in Lanceton.

12:55.885 --> 12:58.019
And he didn't want me
hanging out with Snot,

12:58.054 --> 12:59.821
so he did the same thing again!

12:59.856 --> 13:01.156
I can't believe it!

13:01.190 --> 13:02.557
I couldn't believe it, either.

13:02.592 --> 13:04.759
And that was three
years ago... so...

13:04.794 --> 13:07.679
I actually couldn't
believe it before you.

13:11.784 --> 13:14.920
(rock music playing in distance)

13:14.954 --> 13:17.272
(loud rock music continues) Snot!

13:17.306 --> 13:18.406
Steve!

13:18.441 --> 13:20.075
I'm here to save you!

13:20.109 --> 13:21.409
From the Capellis?

13:21.444 --> 13:23.712
No! From my dad!

13:23.763 --> 13:25.881
What the hell are <i>you</i> doing here?

13:25.915 --> 13:27.015
Oh, hey, Steve.

13:27.049 --> 13:28.817
Hey, you were right.
Snot's great!

13:28.851 --> 13:30.502
We're totally best friends now.

13:30.536 --> 13:33.171
Hey, Mr. Smith.
Hey, Darnell.

13:33.291 --> 13:35.557
Is it safe for me
to come out of hiding yet?

13:35.591 --> 13:37.092
Nope.

13:41.775 --> 13:43.425
(loud rock music playing)

13:43.443 --> 13:46.165
(turns off music)
Wait, let me get this straight.

13:46.285 --> 13:47.786
There's no Capellis?

13:47.820 --> 13:49.806
I don't need to be
in witness protection?

13:49.926 --> 13:52.457
All made up... just
to keep us apart

13:52.491 --> 13:53.636
because he didn't like you.

13:53.756 --> 13:54.986
Stan?

13:55.106 --> 13:57.186
Yeah, but, Snot, that
was before I got to know you.

13:57.187 --> 13:59.514
I mean, you're absolutely
amazing, buddy!

14:02.351 --> 14:04.986
What are you doing?
Snot's not your buddy!

14:05.021 --> 14:07.188
He's your kidnap victim, you psycho!

14:07.223 --> 14:09.024
Hey, hey, hey, Steve.

14:09.058 --> 14:10.659
Coming in a little hot.

14:10.693 --> 14:12.661
How are you not furious with him?!

14:12.695 --> 14:13.945
Because he's forgiving, Steve.

14:13.980 --> 14:16.297
If you knew him as well as I do,

14:16.332 --> 14:19.351
you would've included that in your
"five hard facts about Snot."

14:19.385 --> 14:21.152
Plus, you forgot
his one "soft fact."

14:21.187 --> 14:23.989
Squirrels love him.
Isn't that right, Nutsy?

14:24.023 --> 14:25.407
(chitters)

14:25.441 --> 14:26.708
You guys aren't friends!

14:26.742 --> 14:28.209
You're a
14-year-old boy,

14:28.244 --> 14:29.878
and he's a
42-year-old man.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.346
14 and a <i>half.</i>

14:31.380 --> 14:33.114
And I <i>just</i> turned 42.

14:33.149 --> 14:35.116
Besides, he made witness protection fun.

14:35.151 --> 14:36.618
But it was all fake.

14:36.652 --> 14:38.453
So is air guitar, but we love <i>that.</i>

14:38.487 --> 14:40.288
You don't get to talk about air guitar!

14:40.322 --> 14:42.640
I don't need to talk about it!
(singing guitar solo)

14:42.675 --> 14:45.510
(Stan and Steve singing guitar solos)

14:46.846 --> 14:50.498
Guys, guys, I can be friends
with both of you.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.902
All right, then, I'm gonna pack up.

14:53.936 --> 14:56.171
While you do, I'll read
you all the letters

14:56.205 --> 14:59.140
I wrote to you that you <i>never got.</i>

14:59.175 --> 15:00.675
"18 March.

15:00.710 --> 15:03.645
"It's been a fortnight
since our last frolic.

15:03.679 --> 15:06.347
My bosom heaves with the weight
of your absence."

15:08.884 --> 15:11.202
So, what happened while I was gone?

15:11.236 --> 15:12.987
Anybody get pregnant at school?

15:13.022 --> 15:14.706
<i>Yeah,</i> like everybody.

15:14.740 --> 15:17.509
Oh, hey, I got you a little
welcome-home gift.

15:17.543 --> 15:19.344
Carnival tickets, baby!

15:19.378 --> 15:20.845
You!

15:20.880 --> 15:22.380
You know me!

15:22.415 --> 15:23.998
What up, d-bags?

15:24.033 --> 15:27.185
What a coincidence. I didn't
know this was your hang.

15:27.219 --> 15:29.187
Dad, you dropped me off
here ten minutes ago.

15:29.221 --> 15:30.355
Sure did.
What's going on?

15:30.389 --> 15:32.207
Snot and I are going to the carnival.

15:32.241 --> 15:33.641
Cool! I'm in.
I'll drive us.

15:33.676 --> 15:36.544
Ooh, sorry, Dad, but
you don't have a ticket.

15:36.579 --> 15:38.847
Oh, I guess this is
the first sold-out carnival

15:38.881 --> 15:40.198
in the history of carnivals.

15:40.232 --> 15:42.400
I'll <i>buy</i> a ticket.

15:42.434 --> 15:44.235
Yell "shotgun" real loud.
Yell "shotgun."

15:44.270 --> 15:46.404
Shotgun? Snot said shotgun!
Snot said shotgun!

15:46.438 --> 15:49.040
Oh, Steve, man, I'm sorry.

15:49.075 --> 15:51.910
Oh, Steve, that sucks!

15:55.548 --> 15:56.748
This is getting ridiculous!

15:56.782 --> 15:58.383
You want me to walk you home again?

15:58.417 --> 16:00.418
It didn't help last time.

16:01.787 --> 16:03.988
Sheesh! Just trying
to help the kid out.

16:04.023 --> 16:06.024
(door closes)

16:06.058 --> 16:09.127
(bones crack)
I'm gonna rape him this time.

16:09.161 --> 16:12.147
(wind whistling,
siren wails in distance)

16:15.301 --> 16:17.135
You know the drill here.

16:17.169 --> 16:21.439
You know... I-I remember a time
when this was a safe hallway.

16:21.474 --> 16:25.310
I left my door unlocked.
Kids played after dark.

16:25.344 --> 16:27.145
I could walk home without being scared.

16:27.179 --> 16:29.180
And I don't want to be scared anymore!

16:29.215 --> 16:30.648
Just shut up and give me...

16:30.666 --> 16:31.633
(gunshot) Aah!

16:31.667 --> 16:34.152
(gunshots continue)

16:34.186 --> 16:35.503
(grunting)

16:35.538 --> 16:37.372
(gun clicking)

16:39.492 --> 16:41.626
(weak groaning)

16:41.660 --> 16:43.294
(gunshot) Aah!

16:43.329 --> 16:45.497
That's a whoopsie.

16:50.236 --> 16:51.970
Snot, this is amazing!

16:52.004 --> 16:54.355
Yeah! Snot!
Doesn't it remind you

16:54.390 --> 16:55.974
of the time you and I...

16:59.395 --> 17:00.929
Can you believe that ride, Snot?

17:00.963 --> 17:03.231
Oh, my God, my stomach
was all over the place.

17:03.265 --> 17:05.585
The gravity was so strong,
you couldn't even lift your...

17:05.586 --> 17:06.467
(retching)

17:06.502 --> 17:07.902
...head!
I love this place!

17:07.936 --> 17:09.656
So, what's next, Snotters?
What's on deck?

17:09.657 --> 17:11.938
Well, Steve wanted to take
pictures with the butter cow.

17:11.941 --> 17:13.842
You mean, have sex with the butter cow!

17:13.876 --> 17:15.376
Lame!
Really?

17:15.411 --> 17:18.046
Okay. I'm gonna
go get a hot dog.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.231
You mean have sex with a hot dog!

17:20.266 --> 17:22.000
(derisive laughing)

17:22.034 --> 17:23.434
(retching)

17:23.469 --> 17:25.236
(chuckles)

17:26.422 --> 17:27.589
MAN:
Winner!

17:27.623 --> 17:30.158
You want another?
I'll win you another.

17:30.192 --> 17:31.159
Please don't.

17:31.193 --> 17:33.178
They're becoming less special.

17:33.212 --> 17:35.780
(phone vibrates)

17:37.816 --> 17:39.517
Steve went home.

17:39.552 --> 17:42.587
I can't believe he left before he
took our photo booth pictures.

17:42.621 --> 17:44.422
We do it every year.

17:44.456 --> 17:45.924
Maybe we should just go.

17:45.958 --> 17:47.525
Go? No, no, w-we'll
take the pictures!

17:47.560 --> 17:50.061
Me and you in a photo booth?
Are you kidding me?

17:50.095 --> 17:51.212
That is happening!

17:53.048 --> 17:56.584
I take picture of machine
taking picture.

17:56.619 --> 17:58.286
Get out.

18:00.389 --> 18:02.373
STAN:
Okay, we get four pictures,

18:02.408 --> 18:04.309
so we have to do four awesome things.

18:04.343 --> 18:05.743
Okay, what are four awesome things?

18:05.778 --> 18:07.412
Ooh, wait,
I-I know what to do.

18:07.446 --> 18:09.447
(shutter clicks four times)

18:11.033 --> 18:12.333
Yeah, so...

18:12.368 --> 18:13.801
I think I'm gonna go.

18:13.836 --> 18:16.571
What? D-Don't you want to see
how the pictures came out?

18:16.605 --> 18:18.439
Yeah, I'll see them later.

18:18.474 --> 18:20.174
Thanks for...

18:20.209 --> 18:21.542
you know.
