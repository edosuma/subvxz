<i>The whole Chick-fil-A
narrative is just...</i>

00:24.132 --> 00:26.033
I mean, if I may, sir, it's...

00:26.034 --> 00:27.802
It's food-nomenal. Really.
It really is.

00:27.803 --> 00:30.504
<i>With that construction
outside, man,</i>

00:30.505 --> 00:33.007
I was stuck in traffic
for two hours.

00:33.008 --> 00:35.310
My bladder was like
a fuckin' blimp.

00:35.311 --> 00:38.880
You should maybe talk some more
to the food manufacturing guys

00:38.881 --> 00:40.281
- and the health advisors.
- Yeah.

00:40.282 --> 00:42.750
Come on, ma'am,
just some small talk.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.319
Even tiny talk will do.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.221
Yeah, I know.
I'm gonna do it.

00:47.222 --> 00:49.157
<i>God, what a waste
of a morning.</i>

00:49.158 --> 00:52.326
If you ever want me to confess,
don't rip out my fingernails,

00:52.327 --> 00:54.696
just make me eat like a
vegan for a fuckin' week.

00:54.697 --> 00:57.666
The VP look like she's about
ready to open up a vein.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.235
You okay?

00:59.236 --> 01:01.805
- You seem to be phoning it in a little.
- You know what, Amy?

01:01.806 --> 01:04.308
I'm the veep
I never wanted to be.

01:04.309 --> 01:09.014
I'm talking salad wraps and body
mass index to these idiots.

01:09.015 --> 01:10.615
You should really
just go and...

01:10.616 --> 01:13.018
Yeah, I know, feel my soul
slide out of my ass.

01:13.019 --> 01:14.619
All right, here.
You take that.

01:14.620 --> 01:17.123
I'm building up
the energy right now.

01:17.124 --> 01:19.091
This smells like the inside
of a taxi cab.

01:19.092 --> 01:22.362
- Hi, guys. Hello.
- Hello.

01:22.363 --> 01:23.496
Not too much longer.

01:23.497 --> 01:26.199
We'll get the group shot taken
and then you guys can get moving.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.700
Awesome!

01:27.701 --> 01:29.335
What a productive morning.

01:29.336 --> 01:31.003
Can you envision selling
some of these items

01:31.004 --> 01:32.939
at any of your stores,
you think?

01:32.940 --> 01:34.807
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah. Wraps maybe.

01:34.808 --> 01:37.077
<i>- Yeah, wraps.
- Grapes. I mean, grapes are always good.</i>

01:37.078 --> 01:39.012
Grapes are... hey,
you can't beat grapes.

01:39.013 --> 01:43.284
Those yellow things
look... so...

01:43.285 --> 01:46.355
Well, I'll tell you
it's all local

01:46.356 --> 01:48.424
- and it's all organic.
- Oh, wow.

01:48.425 --> 01:50.426
- Orgasmic's more like it, right?
- Oh.

01:50.427 --> 01:53.896
I'll have some of what you're having.

01:55.466 --> 01:57.734
- Do you have a zoom on that thing?
- Oh, Ken, you know what?

01:57.735 --> 02:00.070
We don't have pictures
taken here right now, okay?

02:00.071 --> 02:02.205
- Sorry.
- Oh, no. It's fine.

02:03.641 --> 02:06.643
You back to DC tonight,
Gary?

02:06.644 --> 02:08.745
Yeah, I'm leaving
a little bit earlier.

02:08.746 --> 02:11.615
- My dad is having his birthday dinner.
- Nice.

02:14.119 --> 02:17.822
He has very little
respect for my job.

02:17.823 --> 02:20.559
He actually much rather
me work here.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.662
- In catering?
- No, a baseball stadium.

02:23.663 --> 02:25.163
Oh.

02:25.164 --> 02:26.598
A man's man, a jock.

02:26.599 --> 02:28.734
Rarrrh!
One of those guys.

02:28.735 --> 02:32.471
- Wow, that's gotta be tough.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

02:33.941 --> 02:36.376
I meant for him.

02:36.377 --> 02:38.612
- Jesus.
- Okay, you know what, Ken?

02:38.613 --> 02:40.247
- Not so close, okay?
- Okay.

02:40.248 --> 02:43.851
Nobody needs to know which of my
eyebrow hairs needs to be plucked.

02:43.852 --> 02:45.086
Sorry.

02:45.087 --> 02:47.555
All right. What's going
on with this group shot?

02:47.556 --> 02:49.591
- What's the delay?
- It's not much longer, ma'am.

02:49.592 --> 02:51.126
Just keep smiling.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.561
Turn that frown...

02:52.562 --> 02:54.563
upside-down.

02:54.564 --> 02:56.899
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.834
Do you see that
he keeps touching me?

02:58.835 --> 03:01.370
- Yeah, I've noticed.
- And his hands are really small.

03:01.371 --> 03:04.773
It's his feely, little, touchy,
hot hands.

03:04.774 --> 03:06.241
Someone needs to tell him
that he's working

03:06.242 --> 03:07.843
with the White House
and not "Penthouse."

03:07.844 --> 03:10.945
Hey, can I talk to you
privately just for a second?

03:10.946 --> 03:12.680
Okay.

03:12.681 --> 03:14.915
The whole thing that you guys have
done with Krispy Kreme is just...

03:14.916 --> 03:17.618
if I may,
it's food-nomenal, really.

03:17.619 --> 03:20.988
So you know that I've been
seeing Ted, right?

03:20.989 --> 03:23.123
- Mm-hmm.
- A while ago,

03:23.124 --> 03:27.227
a lot of wine was drunk
and Springsteen was listened to

03:27.228 --> 03:29.762
and things got
a little bit out of hand.

03:29.763 --> 03:31.698
You stole a car?

03:31.699 --> 03:34.800
We had unprotected sex,

03:34.801 --> 03:36.669
and I think
I might be pregnant.

03:36.670 --> 03:38.171
Oh...

03:38.172 --> 03:41.107
It's a possibility, Amy.

03:41.108 --> 03:43.409
I haven't reached
menopause yet, you know.

03:43.410 --> 03:45.945
I'm not barren.
I know it's unlikely.

03:45.946 --> 03:48.815
I could probably have
unprotected sex with 30 men,

03:48.816 --> 03:52.218
one right after the other,
and it would be totally fine.

03:52.219 --> 03:53.953
I mean, no, it wouldn't
be totally fine.

03:53.954 --> 03:55.589
I mean, that would be
a horrible thing.

03:55.590 --> 03:57.691
I'm not doubting
your fertility, ma'am,

03:57.692 --> 04:00.027
but an unwed mother

04:00.028 --> 04:02.096
one aneurism away
from the presidency?

04:02.097 --> 04:04.299
How do you think that plays?

04:04.300 --> 04:06.234
The bag has got
one big storage area

04:06.235 --> 04:08.670
and then there are 60 separate
pockets within the area.

04:08.671 --> 04:09.971
- Hmm.
- Wow!

04:09.972 --> 04:11.573
<i>- Right?
- That is a lot to remember, Gary.</i>

04:11.574 --> 04:13.308
I know, I know.

04:13.309 --> 04:15.377
But can you do it
without looking?

04:15.378 --> 04:16.878
Try me.

04:16.879 --> 04:18.512
Eye drops.

04:20.148 --> 04:21.882
Ooh!

04:21.882 --> 04:24.084
- Wipes.
- Scented, unscented?

04:24.986 --> 04:27.354
Scented.

04:27.355 --> 04:28.989
<i>- Bam!
- Wow!</i>

04:28.990 --> 04:31.425
- Knock it...
- That's unbelievable.

04:31.426 --> 04:34.061
I hope I'm not pregnant,
because, fuck, if I am,

04:34.062 --> 04:36.364
I'm just finished, you know?

04:36.365 --> 04:39.234
- Ma'am.
- Let's get moving!

04:40.837 --> 04:43.438
- You know you'll have to keep it.
- I know.

04:43.439 --> 04:48.344
Unless we go on some sort of
special vacation to Mexico and...

04:48.345 --> 04:50.547
kill the doctor in the desert.

04:50.548 --> 04:52.215
Father know?

04:52.216 --> 04:54.417
What, are you kidding me?
What am I, 15?

04:54.418 --> 04:57.553
- I mean Ted.
- Oh, shit. No.

04:57.554 --> 05:00.822
No. I'm still
working on that one.

05:00.823 --> 05:04.826
- What are you shooting with?
- This is a 5D.

05:04.827 --> 05:07.529
- Not a 1D?
- No.

05:07.530 --> 05:09.397
Why would I need
a 1D to shoot this?

05:09.398 --> 05:10.798
I have a 1D.

05:10.799 --> 05:13.134
It's more expensive,
but it's a really nice camera.

05:13.135 --> 05:15.703
You shoot a lot of sports?
Moving action?

05:15.704 --> 05:18.340
You take hundreds of pictures
of herons catching fish?

05:18.341 --> 05:21.510
Because otherwise
you don't need a 1D.

05:21.511 --> 05:24.947
Right, but I have a 1D.

05:24.948 --> 05:27.117
Yeah.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.318
Hey, will you do me a favor?

05:28.319 --> 05:29.819
Can you get me a real coffee

05:29.820 --> 05:32.856
instead of this fucking beige
paint they're serving, okay?

05:32.857 --> 05:36.359
Grande skinny latte, extra shot,
and a dash of cinnamon?

05:36.360 --> 05:37.660
Yeah.

05:37.661 --> 05:40.396
- Can I get some of the...?
- This is what we're gonna do...

05:40.397 --> 05:42.665
Photos with the nutritionists,
hang with the players,

05:42.666 --> 05:45.768
over to the school, then we
pregnancy test you to fuck.

05:45.769 --> 05:48.636
Listen, will you get the tests on
the way to the school, please?

05:48.637 --> 05:51.072
Absolutely.
I'm heading there right now.

05:51.073 --> 05:53.708
Obviously this is in
our little circle of two.

05:53.709 --> 05:55.677
- Obviously.
- Yeah.

05:57.780 --> 05:59.114
Hey, Jonah.

05:59.115 --> 06:00.815
How's the weather
up there in your asshole?

06:00.816 --> 06:01.884
<i>Oh ho.</i>

06:01.885 --> 06:03.485
That's cute, Mike.
How's it going?

06:03.486 --> 06:07.256
Good, good. Just going over my
notes for the press briefing.

06:07.257 --> 06:09.859
Hey, did you get those
local business initiatives

06:09.860 --> 06:11.394
I sent over from the president?

06:11.395 --> 06:13.229
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Looking at them right now.

06:13.230 --> 06:15.965
<i>- Thank you. They're very helpful.
- Oh, good.</i>

06:15.966 --> 06:18.367
I'm glad you're right on top of that.
I can see you, Mike.

06:19.836 --> 06:21.637
What? Oh.

06:21.638 --> 06:24.840
<i>- This is awesome!
- You know what, Mike?</i>

06:24.841 --> 06:27.243
One day you're gonna wake up
and you're gonna find

06:27.244 --> 06:29.411
your lungs have
turned to pastry.

06:29.412 --> 06:31.413
Gotta go, Jonah.
Got incoming.

06:31.414 --> 06:33.815
<i>- Mike.
- Amy, what's up?</i>

06:33.816 --> 06:37.252
Selina might be pregnant.
What do we wanna do?

06:37.253 --> 06:38.920
Is this for real?

06:38.921 --> 06:40.989
'Cause if it is, the best
thing for her legacy

06:40.990 --> 06:43.258
is if she's assassinated
before she starts showing.

06:43.259 --> 06:44.892
It's not definite.

06:44.893 --> 06:46.527
She still needs
to take some tests.

06:46.528 --> 06:48.863
Okay. I'll guess I'll just add
this to the press release.

06:48.864 --> 06:50.331
People can start taking bets.

06:50.332 --> 06:52.834
You know that this needs
to be way under the lid.

06:52.835 --> 06:54.902
- Bye.
- All good?

06:54.903 --> 06:56.971
Absolutely.

06:56.972 --> 07:00.241
It's gonna knock the socks
off of some seven-year-olds.

07:04.279 --> 07:06.414
Dad, dad, I like beer.

07:06.415 --> 07:08.716
That was because I cut my lip
trying to open the bottle.

07:08.717 --> 07:10.184
I just can't open it
the way you do.

07:10.185 --> 07:12.587
Listen, the veep and I
are gonna have our photo taken

07:12.588 --> 07:14.055
with the Orioles players.

07:14.056 --> 07:15.090
Huh?

07:15.091 --> 07:16.925
Yeah, I can get you one.

07:16.926 --> 07:19.027
Shit, yeah.
Shit, yeah.

07:19.028 --> 07:20.895
Where the fuck is coffee?

07:20.896 --> 07:23.665
So that whole stadium day

07:23.666 --> 07:26.467
- was like a networking orgy for you, right?
- Oh, yeah.

07:26.468 --> 07:29.971
Yeah, yeah.
Business card bukkake.

07:29.972 --> 07:32.073
You know, you should get
something while we're here...

07:32.074 --> 07:35.209
Razor blades, a large
amount of pain killers.

07:35.210 --> 07:36.844
Holy sh...

07:36.845 --> 07:39.013
Are you pregnant?

07:39.014 --> 07:41.916
Amy, come on, career-wise,
that's like joining scientology

07:41.917 --> 07:43.684
or getting
a fucking neck tattoo.

07:43.685 --> 07:45.452
Thanks for the support.

07:45.453 --> 07:49.122
So I guess you're gonna be
needing maternity leave.

07:49.123 --> 07:51.492
I'd be the obvious choice
for your replacement.

07:51.493 --> 07:53.994
That is literally
your first thought?

07:53.995 --> 07:56.029
No. My first thought was,
"there goes your figure,"

07:56.030 --> 07:57.831
but I didn't say that because I
thought it would be upsetting.

07:57.832 --> 07:59.332
Thanks. You know,
if it's a boy,

07:59.333 --> 08:02.769
maybe I'll name him after you.
Call him fuck weasel.

08:02.770 --> 08:04.771
Ken, is this where I should be?

08:04.772 --> 08:06.206
- Don't be too clustered.
- Yeah, don't be too clustered.

08:06.207 --> 08:07.674
Thank you.
I got it.

08:07.675 --> 08:09.775
<i>So if you could just
move a little bit...</i>

08:09.776 --> 08:12.645
- Yeah, a little bit so we're not all on one side.
- So we're not on one side.

08:12.646 --> 08:14.847
<i>- Can you see everybody?
- I think they heard me.</i>

08:14.848 --> 08:17.417
<i>Yes, how about one where we
say "let's get moving"?</i>

08:17.418 --> 08:18.852
<i>Let's get moving!</i>

08:18.853 --> 08:20.387
<i>All right, how
about another one?</i>

08:20.388 --> 08:23.424
<i>Another where we say
"awesome avocado!"</i>

08:23.425 --> 08:27.062
<i>- Awesome avocado!
- Yes, that was great.</i>

08:27.063 --> 08:29.331
All right! Thank you
for your patience.

08:29.332 --> 08:30.966
<i>- Thank you so much for being here.
- Ma'am.</i>

08:30.967 --> 08:32.601
<i>- It sure... yes? Yes?
- Gentlemen.</i>

08:32.602 --> 08:34.403
Construction hit a gas main.

08:34.404 --> 08:37.539
There's a serious leak.
Everybody must stay in here until it's made safe.

08:37.539 --> 08:39.041
Sorry.

08:39.042 --> 08:41.409
Because of the danger, we need
everybody to stay in the room.

08:41.410 --> 08:42.511
We'll update you.

08:42.513 --> 08:45.982
Listen, uh, but I can
get out of here, right?

08:45.983 --> 08:48.017
Probably in about an hour.

08:48.018 --> 08:50.286
- An hour?
- Yes, ma'am.

08:51.689 --> 08:53.924
<i>We're so excited about</i>

08:53.925 --> 08:56.226
- the vice president's visit.
- Oh, we're very excited, too.

08:56.227 --> 08:57.862
Amy's practically
having a baby about it.

08:57.863 --> 08:59.997
- Isn't that right?
- Well, the chilen e waiting.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.265
Right this way.

09:01.266 --> 09:03.401
Hey, kids.
Good afternoon.

09:05.571 --> 09:07.005
My name is Dan,
this is Amy.

09:07.006 --> 09:08.907
And we work for
the vice president

09:08.908 --> 09:11.143
of the United States
of America.

09:11.144 --> 09:13.679
- Yay.
- Pretty cool, right? Yeah.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.547
Yeah, my man right here.

09:15.548 --> 09:16.848
My dad works
in the state department.

09:16.849 --> 09:18.983
Really?
What position?

09:18.984 --> 09:21.819
- Trade policy executive.
- So he knows Roger Aldrige?

09:21.820 --> 09:23.554
Uh, I don't know.

09:23.555 --> 09:25.923
Are you networking
with an eight-year-old?

09:25.924 --> 09:27.724
Yeah.

09:27.725 --> 09:29.192
So...

09:29.193 --> 09:31.261
Hold on one second, chief.

09:31.262 --> 09:33.530
- Problem?
- There's a gas main leak.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.132
Selina's gonna be delayed
at least an hour.

09:35.133 --> 09:37.768
These kids are gonna go berserk
if they have to wait that long.

09:37.769 --> 09:40.271
We have to keep them entertained.

09:40.272 --> 09:42.473
"Lion King" DVD
and two shots of ritalin.

09:42.474 --> 09:46.111
- You'll be such a great dad.
- That's how I was raised.

09:46.112 --> 09:47.879
All right, shall we,
gentlemen?

09:47.880 --> 09:49.448
Sean, why don't we start
with your question

09:49.449 --> 09:52.017
before you get the DTs and you
can't write in your notebook.

09:52.018 --> 09:54.853
<i>Can you brief on the
new health initiative?</i>

09:54.854 --> 09:56.955
Are you its poster boy, Mikey?

09:56.956 --> 09:58.790
Actually, though,
great question.

09:58.791 --> 10:00.392
You know, we were on
the campaign trail

10:00.393 --> 10:02.627
and we saw a woman
with a very large boy.

10:02.628 --> 10:04.662
And the vice president
turned to me and said,

10:04.663 --> 10:07.732
"I'd like to free that boy
from the prison of obesity."

10:07.733 --> 10:09.348
Anybody else?

10:09.349 --> 10:12.269
Leon West,
Washington Post.

10:12.270 --> 10:14.972
A source tells me
that the VP shit-canned

10:14.973 --> 10:17.008
a secret service agent
just for smiling at her.

10:17.009 --> 10:19.944
Can you give me a yes
or no on that, please?

10:19.945 --> 10:23.114
I believe he was reassigned
because of his cologne.

10:23.115 --> 10:25.150
It was Paco Rabanne.

10:25.151 --> 10:26.986
I mean, this is not
the '80s anymore, right?

10:26.987 --> 10:29.155
Nobody wears that stuff.
Sean might.

10:29.156 --> 10:31.024
You'd probably rather drink it, though.
Right, Sean?

10:31.025 --> 10:32.625
That's necessary.
Thank you, yes.

10:32.626 --> 10:34.261
<i>- I've seen you.
- I'm a drunk.</i>

10:34.262 --> 10:36.329
Okay, every which way
but douche,

10:36.330 --> 10:39.032
I want you to answer
my question now.

10:39.033 --> 10:41.634
I believe, ahem, you asked
a boring question, Leon,

10:41.635 --> 10:43.069
and I gave a boring answer.

10:43.070 --> 10:46.605
That's like carbon offsetting.

10:46.606 --> 10:49.574
Mike, I wouldn't be smiling.
You might lose your job.

10:49.575 --> 10:51.209
You understand my point?

10:51.210 --> 10:53.678
<i>You don't find it repugnant
that Selina Meyer</i>

10:53.679 --> 10:55.713
let a secret service agent
go for smiling?

10:55.714 --> 10:57.415
<i>- Repugnant?
- Yes.</i>

10:57.416 --> 10:59.317
You're calling
the vice president repugnant?

10:59.318 --> 11:01.252
That's a very
emotive term, sir,

11:01.253 --> 11:03.488
and a little prissy,
I might add.

11:03.489 --> 11:06.424
I spent a night in jail
when I was 19 once.

11:06.425 --> 11:07.791
That was more fun than this.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.293
Well, if we get trapped
here another minute,

11:09.294 --> 11:11.061
I'm gonna kill you and eat you,

11:11.062 --> 11:13.230
because I will not eat
another fuckin' falafel.

11:13.231 --> 11:15.065
Hey, Jimmy fuckin' Olsen,

11:15.066 --> 11:17.134
get lost before I shove
that thing up your ass

11:17.135 --> 11:19.403
and give you another kind
of red eye to worry about.

11:19.404 --> 11:21.072
Okay.

11:21.073 --> 11:23.108
What is going on
out there with those two?

11:23.109 --> 11:24.676
- Do you know?
- Yeah, he's all pissed off.

11:24.677 --> 11:27.880
They've been complaining all day
about the event and the food.

11:27.881 --> 11:30.216
- Oh.
- I overhear stuff as I move around.

11:30.217 --> 11:32.285
Plus, I can lip-read.

11:32.286 --> 11:34.687
- You can lip-read?
- Yeah.

11:37.513 --> 11:39.724
Yes, I can tell
what are you saying now.

11:40.728 --> 11:42.695
Could you lip-read earlier

11:42.696 --> 11:44.764
when I was talking
about you to Amy?

11:44.765 --> 11:47.967
- No.
- Oh, that's too bad. It was all good.

11:47.968 --> 11:49.835
- Thank you.
- Oh, sure.

11:51.738 --> 11:52.838
Amy.

11:52.839 --> 11:53.806
<i>Amy.</i>

11:53.807 --> 11:55.542
God, that is a lot of snot.

11:55.543 --> 11:57.978
Hey, can I have my pen back?

11:57.979 --> 11:59.880
Mike, hi.
Thank you.

11:59.881 --> 12:03.718
I just wanna warn you, on top of
everything else... smile story.

12:03.719 --> 12:07.021
Can I get the pen cap, too?
This came with a pen cap.

12:07.022 --> 12:08.790
What the hell is going on over there?
Are you listening?

12:08.791 --> 12:10.625
Yes, yes. Story.
What...?

12:10.626 --> 12:12.694
The pen cap.
Where was the pen... in your mouth?

12:12.695 --> 12:14.262
Did you put it in your mouth?

12:14.263 --> 12:15.830
Okay, I just wanna give you
a heads-up, all right?

12:15.831 --> 12:17.999
It's out there.
They're saying she's repugnant.

12:20.268 --> 12:22.002
Oh, my God.

12:22.003 --> 12:25.639
<i>- Hi.
- I have just had a phone call from Mike.</i>

12:25.640 --> 12:28.908
He said that the press
is saying you are pregnant.

12:28.909 --> 12:30.677
<i>He's saying it's out.</i>

12:30.678 --> 12:32.345
No, it can't be.

12:32.346 --> 12:34.580
What are you talking about?
Nobody knows.

12:34.581 --> 12:38.684
He said that Leon West
said that you're pregnant.

12:38.685 --> 12:42.622
Holy f... uck.

12:42.623 --> 12:44.990
Ugh, I can't move my lips.

12:44.991 --> 12:47.960
Okay, I'm going
because Gary's calling.

12:47.961 --> 12:49.495
Don't tell Gary.

12:49.496 --> 12:51.096
No, Amy, they're not
gonna let me through.

12:51.097 --> 12:52.431
I'm running out of time here.

12:52.432 --> 12:53.766
<i>My dad needs a picture.</i>

12:53.767 --> 12:55.735
Okay, I need you

12:55.736 --> 12:58.537
to get a pregnancy test
for the veep.

12:58.538 --> 13:02.441
Oh, my... oh, my God.

13:02.442 --> 13:04.544
- That's kind of exciting.
- No, no. Shh, shh.

13:04.545 --> 13:07.347
I can carry the baby around in a
little sling or something like that.

13:07.348 --> 13:10.283
Oh, my... oh, wait, this is bad
because she's not married, right?

13:10.284 --> 13:12.819
Indeed, and this is
strictly need-to-know.

13:12.820 --> 13:14.621
What kind of test do I get?
Are there different kinds?

13:14.622 --> 13:16.289
How do I break it down?
What do I get?

13:16.290 --> 13:18.959
<i>I've only got one, so get as
many as you can find, okay?</i>

13:18.960 --> 13:20.360
We need to be sure, okay?

13:20.361 --> 13:22.363
<i>- She need to shock-and-awe this thing.
- Okay.</i>

13:22.364 --> 13:25.700
Hey. So what's
the intel on the baby?

13:25.701 --> 13:27.268
Intel.

13:27.269 --> 13:30.238
Copy that.
Security clearance denied.

13:30.239 --> 13:32.207
Is Jonah the dad?

13:32.208 --> 13:34.942
Is that why you look like you
wanna drink a bottle of drano?

13:34.943 --> 13:37.612
I don't blame you.
That's gonna be a long labor.

13:37.613 --> 13:39.713
They're gonna be pulling that
kid out of you in shifts.

13:39.714 --> 13:41.715
- Jonah?
- Yes, ma'am.

13:41.716 --> 13:44.251
We gotta get rid of this whole
prison-yard-vibe feeling.

13:44.252 --> 13:45.619
We gotta do something.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.487
Well, we have to stay
within the stadium,

13:47.488 --> 13:50.389
but we could invite the guys down
to meet the Orioles players.

13:50.390 --> 13:53.259
Okay, that's exactly
what we gonna do.

13:53.260 --> 13:56.062
I forgot to find out
something about the players.

13:56.063 --> 13:58.298
- I don't know what to say to them.
- I can help you along.

13:58.299 --> 14:01.267
- Oh, you know about baseball?
- I do, yeah.

14:01.268 --> 14:03.070
- You can be my Gary?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:03.071 --> 14:05.406
- I'll be the adult version of Gary.
- Okay.

14:05.407 --> 14:06.941
<i>Jonah, can you see me?</i>

14:06.942 --> 14:08.309
Uh, yeah.
Give me their numbers.

14:08.310 --> 14:10.812
<i>- I'll go off that.
- Hold on. Let me see.</i>

14:10.813 --> 14:12.514
34.

14:12.515 --> 14:14.649
Jake Arrieta.
He's a starting pitcher.

14:14.650 --> 14:17.652
<i>On his left is number 39,
Tommy Hunter.</i>

14:17.653 --> 14:19.053
He's a starting pitcher.

14:19.054 --> 14:21.389
<i>- Wait, he's the starting pitcher?
- Yes.</i>

14:21.390 --> 14:24.559
<i>The next gentleman...
Oh, that's Jim Palmer.</i>

14:24.560 --> 14:26.260
He's a hall-of-famer.
That guy's a legend.

14:26.261 --> 14:27.528
He's a starting pitcher
as well.

14:27.529 --> 14:29.963
You don't have multiple
starting pitchers.

14:29.964 --> 14:31.231
There's one pitcher's mound.

14:31.232 --> 14:33.033
<i>You see one mound
or three mounds?</i>

14:33.034 --> 14:35.890
<i>- I see one mound.
- That's how you play baseball.</i>

14:35.891 --> 14:37.793
<i>They don't pitch
on the same day.</i>

14:37.794 --> 14:39.373
You don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

14:39.374 --> 14:41.142
Fuckin' idiot.

14:41.143 --> 14:44.346
Hello! Hi!

14:44.347 --> 14:46.381
- Honor to meet you, ma'am.
- And you are Jake.

14:46.382 --> 14:48.150
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, how nice.

14:48.151 --> 14:51.987
- And you'the starting pitcher.
- One of them. Yes, ma'am.

14:51.988 --> 14:53.856
Okay. Wonderful.

14:53.857 --> 14:56.992
- So you must be Tommy.
- I am. I am.

14:56.993 --> 14:59.127
Um, are you a starting pitcher?

14:59.128 --> 15:02.196
- I am, I am, I am.
- You are a starting... ahem.

15:02.197 --> 15:05.033
<i>Hello, dad.
I'm still at the stadium.</i>

15:05.034 --> 15:06.667
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

15:06.668 --> 15:10.171
I'm with the team...
my playas.

15:10.172 --> 15:12.773
I will get you that pic, man.

15:12.774 --> 15:15.810
Boom shaka laka.

15:15.811 --> 15:18.246
That's how they talk.

15:18.247 --> 15:20.048
Okay.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.283
Are these all the
pregnancy tests you have?

15:22.284 --> 15:24.352
- I think you got them all.
- Okay.

15:24.353 --> 15:26.621
I hope you get the result
you're looking for.

15:26.622 --> 15:29.090
No, it's not for me.

15:30.359 --> 15:32.894
- It's my sister.
- I'm sorry?

15:32.895 --> 15:35.062
I... did you see that?

15:35.063 --> 15:36.931
See what?

15:36.932 --> 15:39.500
Okay, um, I just...

15:39.501 --> 15:42.270
Is there any other stuff
I should get for my sister?

15:42.271 --> 15:44.739
Like a maternity underwear?

15:44.740 --> 15:47.074
- How long has she been pregnant?
- Oh, God, I don't know.

15:47.075 --> 15:49.310
I don't know anything
about her private life.

15:49.311 --> 15:53.647
I do know, however, that the past
few weeks she has been pretty busy.

15:55.183 --> 15:58.151
I'd hold off
on the maternity underwear.

15:58.152 --> 16:02.222
Isn't this nice how the lettering
works on these... on these tops?

16:02.223 --> 16:03.891
Thank you.

16:03.892 --> 16:06.427
Oh, brother.
I'm just... you know what?

16:06.428 --> 16:08.729
I've got the treasury
secretary calling.

16:08.730 --> 16:10.465
Let me take this and I'm
gonna be right back.

16:10.466 --> 16:11.800
I'm so sorry.
Pardon me.

16:11.801 --> 16:13.568
Hello?
Hello, Ted?

16:13.569 --> 16:16.529
<i>Hey. So are you looking for a
little afternoon delight?</i>

16:16.530 --> 16:18.873
No. Listen to me for a second.
I gotta tell you something.

16:18.874 --> 16:21.309
<i>I might be pregnant.
All right?</i>

16:21.310 --> 16:23.011
<i>I'm sorry to have to be
so blunt about it,</i>

16:23.012 --> 16:24.812
<i>but I don't have a lot of time.</i>

16:24.813 --> 16:27.782
Um, guys, can I have
five minutes?

16:27.783 --> 16:29.984
- What?
- One second, please.

16:29.985 --> 16:33.087
<i>- Are you still there?
- That's impossible.</i>

16:33.088 --> 16:36.290
<i>No, it's not impossible.
I'm not that old.</i>

16:36.291 --> 16:38.392
<i>- Oh, my God.
- All right, you over that bombshell?</i>

16:38.393 --> 16:40.627
Because that bombshell
just gave birth

16:40.628 --> 16:42.529
to a bigger bombshell.

16:42.530 --> 16:44.665
<i>The press know about this.</i>

16:44.666 --> 16:47.033
<i>- Oh, fuck.
- I know.</i>

16:47.034 --> 16:48.701
So this is what
we're gonna do, all right?

16:48.702 --> 16:50.103
We're getting married.

16:50.104 --> 16:51.571
<i>And the plan is</i>

16:51.572 --> 16:54.307
<i>that we got engaged,
like, six weeks ago</i>

16:54.308 --> 16:55.608
or something, all right?

16:55.609 --> 16:59.279
You proposed by giving me
some sort of a ring

16:59.280 --> 17:03.215
in a heart-shaped, fuckin'
oyster thing or something.

17:03.216 --> 17:05.951
<i>You know, the key is in the
details, though, Ted.</i>

17:05.952 --> 17:07.386
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

17:07.387 --> 17:09.586
Anyway, listen, you've
gotta get me a ring.

17:09.587 --> 17:12.151
You've gotta go,
you've gotta get a ring now.

17:12.152 --> 17:13.726
And it's gonna have to be
a big one.

17:13.727 --> 17:16.528
Well, what size is your finger?

17:16.529 --> 17:18.896
I don't know how fucking
big my finger is, Ted!

17:18.897 --> 17:20.298
Just be a man,

17:20.299 --> 17:21.465
<i>stand up,</i>

17:21.467 --> 17:23.834
<i>get the fuckin' ring,
all right?</i>

17:23.835 --> 17:25.435
Okay.

17:27.472 --> 17:30.040
You're fucking kidding.

17:30.041 --> 17:34.111
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help but overhear.

17:34.112 --> 17:35.946
I just... you're
getting married.

17:35.947 --> 17:37.982
I wanted to be the first one
to offer my congratulations.

17:37.983 --> 17:39.217
- Okay. Ken?
- Yeah.

17:39.218 --> 17:41.619
Read my lips...
Don't read my lips.

17:41.620 --> 17:43.855
- You understand me?
- Yeah.

17:47.928 --> 17:48.861
Okay.

17:48.862 --> 17:51.063
- You got it?
- I got it. Okay.

17:51.064 --> 17:53.065
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

17:53.066 --> 17:54.633
Jim Palmer.

17:54.634 --> 17:56.635
- Madam Vice President, nice to meet you.
- What a treat...

17:56.636 --> 17:58.570
- Welcome to Camden Yards.
- Thank you.

17:58.571 --> 18:02.006
- So, Jim, you are a hall-of-famer.
- They let me in there.

18:02.007 --> 18:04.709
Oh, yes, that is a
wonderful thing to be in...

18:04.710 --> 18:06.777
in the hall of fame,
for sure.

18:06.778 --> 18:09.714
- For sure.
- Yes.

18:09.715 --> 18:12.116
Okay.

18:14.319 --> 18:16.587
Okay, it's time for
the group photo, right?

18:16.588 --> 18:17.621
<i>All right, great.</i>

18:17.622 --> 18:19.390
Okay, everyone say
"Orioles."

18:19.391 --> 18:21.391
- Orioles!
- Great.

18:21.392 --> 18:24.328
<i>- Okay, I guess we're done. We got the shot.
- Got it.</i>

18:24.329 --> 18:25.963
Okay, everybody,
thank you so much.

18:25.964 --> 18:27.431
- God bless America.
- Thank you.

18:27.432 --> 18:29.567
Okay, thank you.

18:31.336 --> 18:33.637
- Thank you.
- Okay.

18:33.638 --> 18:36.240
Veep has left the stadium.
She's gonna be here in 20.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.908
Okay.

18:37.909 --> 18:41.211
One last push to keep
these kids entertained.

18:41.212 --> 18:42.813
You know, I saw
a guitar in there.

18:42.814 --> 18:45.448
You play the guitar,
all right?

18:45.449 --> 18:47.050
Not in this situation.

18:47.051 --> 18:48.484
- Yes. Yes.
- Amy, no.

18:48.485 --> 18:50.820
My guitar is for seduction,
not crowd control, all right?

18:50.821 --> 18:53.856
Granted, on a good night that's
one and the same, but still.

18:53.857 --> 18:55.258
No, we're finding you
a guitar.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.928
- That's what we're doing.
- Oh, isn't this cute?

18:57.929 --> 19:00.197
- Look at you guys making juice.
- Leon.

19:00.198 --> 19:02.133
Go away.
Why are you here?

19:02.134 --> 19:04.368
<i>- Oh...
- She means hello.</i>

19:04.369 --> 19:07.973
I actually have a story I'd
like to discuss with the veep.

19:07.974 --> 19:10.275
She here yet?

19:10.276 --> 19:13.279
No. No, of course not,
because she hates punctuality

19:13.280 --> 19:15.848
almost as much
as good governance.

19:15.849 --> 19:17.616
So what should we do, guys?

19:17.617 --> 19:21.420
<i>* Dormez-vous?
Dormez-vous? *</i>

19:21.421 --> 19:25.691
<i>* Sonnez les matines,
sonnez les matines... *</i>

19:28.061 --> 19:30.563
No, I'm sorry, sir. We have
no comment on that at the moment.

19:30.564 --> 19:31.531
Thank you.
Goodbye.

19:31.532 --> 19:33.132
Why would we need
to ban smiling?

19:33.133 --> 19:35.268
It's not like something we have
time for in the first place.

19:36.604 --> 19:38.744
- Ma'am.
- Sue, listen...

19:38.745 --> 19:41.709
Ted proposed to me
about six to eight weeks ago, okay?

19:41.710 --> 19:43.544
Oh, congratulations, ma'am.

19:43.545 --> 19:44.678
No, no, no, he didn't really.

19:44.679 --> 19:46.013
We're just gonna
pretend that he did.

19:46.014 --> 19:47.782
Okay. I assume
he's in on this.

19:47.783 --> 19:49.150
<i>So now what I need you to do</i>

19:49.151 --> 19:50.684
is go to my calendar
thing, please,

19:50.685 --> 19:52.653
and let's find a date where
this would have happened.

19:52.654 --> 19:55.423
The Children of Courage Awards...
Would he have proposed then?

19:55.424 --> 19:58.126
No, no, uh-uh.
That's kids with alopecia,

19:58.127 --> 20:00.528
their mothers are on crack...
that's a complete freak show.

20:00.529 --> 20:02.163
Okay. Ah.
Two months ago,

20:02.164 --> 20:05.166
you and Ted went to an ice hockey
game and had dinner after.

20:05.167 --> 20:06.500
<i>Perfect. Yes.</i>

20:06.501 --> 20:07.769
Okay?
Thank you very much.

20:07.770 --> 20:10.404
Sue, Sue, Sue,
did the president call?

20:10.405 --> 20:14.308
- No.
- No. Yeah, okay. Right.

20:14.309 --> 20:15.743
The "as" and the "es"
are like your basics.

20:15.744 --> 20:17.812
That's like the roots
of blues and stuff.

20:17.813 --> 20:20.281
But if you really... if you get
into some of the funkier stuff,

20:20.282 --> 20:22.483
that's the... see,
it's the sevenths.

20:22.484 --> 20:24.252
It's the minor sevenths
that give it that...

20:24.253 --> 20:27.322
sort of that autumn...
that sort of gloom to it.

20:27.323 --> 20:29.758
I just love that.

20:29.759 --> 20:32.794
It's kind of moody, sort
of sleepy, but I like it.

20:32.795 --> 20:36.465
It's... it does well
with the...

20:36.466 --> 20:37.866
You'll figure that out
when you get older.

20:37.867 --> 20:39.601
So it's...

20:39.602 --> 20:43.272
- You having fun?
- No.

20:43.273 --> 20:47.644
Hear that? No fun.
You are no fun.

20:47.645 --> 20:52.182
- The vice president is here.
- Yay!

20:54.118 --> 20:56.786
- Leon West is here.
- Oh, great.

20:56.787 --> 20:58.654
Now all we need
are my parents on Skype.

20:58.655 --> 21:00.056
Do you have the tests?

21:00.057 --> 21:02.091
I have one.
Gary's coming with more.

21:02.092 --> 21:04.026
We're gonna have more tests
than you have pee.

21:04.027 --> 21:07.062
You told Gary?

21:07.063 --> 21:09.865
- Oh, hello!
- So he could get the tests.

21:09.866 --> 21:12.600
Okay, we'll found out.
I'll just have Gary do the tests.

21:12.601 --> 21:15.804
- How will that work?
- No, not with his pee, Amy.

21:15.805 --> 21:17.707
<i>- Hi!
- Wait a second.</i>

21:17.708 --> 21:19.835
So... so, ma'am... so you're
the one who's pregnant?

21:19.836 --> 21:22.713
- I might be pregnant.
- So we're looking at a wedding.

21:22.714 --> 21:24.448
Or a suicide.
I haven't decided which.

21:24.449 --> 21:28.119
Look at these
fantastic children!

21:28.120 --> 21:32.824
- Madam Vice President.
- Hello. I'm so sorry I'm late.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.927
I have never meant
those words more.

21:34.928 --> 21:36.428
It's a pleasure to meet you.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.996
<i>The children are waiting
and ready for you.</i>

21:37.997 --> 21:39.698
You know, I need to use

21:39.699 --> 21:42.034
the ladies' room
very briefly, if I may.

21:42.035 --> 21:44.269
Of course.
The staff restroom is right there.

21:44.270 --> 21:47.005
Fantastic.
I'm also parched

21:47.006 --> 21:49.040
and I'm wondering if I might...

21:49.041 --> 21:51.443
- Can I have a cup of water?
- Of course.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.712
- Maybe in a paper cup?
- Yeah.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.914
- This is all we have. Here.
- Oh! Well, this is...

21:55.915 --> 21:57.983
- Okay, it's in a plastic, clear...
- It should be fine.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.584
<i>- It'll be fine.
- It'll be fine.</i>

21:59.585 --> 22:01.988
Thank you.

22:03.457 --> 22:05.358
Okay, cool it.

22:15.671 --> 22:18.339
Oh, good lord.

22:21.162 --> 22:25.078
So what do you think?
Is she really pregnant?

22:25.079 --> 22:26.779
How should I know?

22:26.780 --> 22:28.414
- You're a woman.
- What?

22:28.415 --> 22:30.283
You think that as a woman I
might sense some disturbance

22:30.284 --> 22:32.351
in the fuckin' "lady matrix"?

22:32.352 --> 22:34.987
- Hey, Ken. How's it going?
- Good.

22:34.988 --> 22:37.423
Hey, I missed that photo
with the Orioles.

22:37.424 --> 22:40.293
Do you think you can kind of do
your magic and photoshop me into it?

22:40.294 --> 22:41.861
- Technically, yes.
- Oh, okay.

22:41.862 --> 22:43.363
Ethically, no.

22:43.364 --> 22:45.398
I document.
I don't invent.

22:45.399 --> 22:47.000
Do it yourself.

22:48.002 --> 22:51.638
Okay.
You got hot hands.

22:51.639 --> 22:53.540
Hey, did she sing
with the kids yet?

22:53.541 --> 22:54.608
- Not yet.
- No.

22:54.609 --> 22:55.909
Awesome.
Where is she?

22:55.910 --> 22:57.578
- Bathroom.
- Okay.

22:57.579 --> 22:59.480
Holy shitballs.
Leon West is here?

22:59.481 --> 23:00.848
Uh-huh. I thought
you knew that.

23:00.849 --> 23:02.215
The guy's like gay porn...
He's everywhere.

23:02.216 --> 23:03.750
Okay, okay, they only had

23:03.751 --> 23:05.519
three types of pregnancy
tests I could find.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.721
Hi, Gary. Okay, that's okay.
We have plenty.

23:07.722 --> 23:10.057
- She's in the bathroom.
- Why are we doing this now?

23:10.058 --> 23:12.126
Because you said that the
pregnancy story is out there,

23:12.127 --> 23:14.194
so we need to
make sure right now.

23:14.195 --> 23:16.463
- Hey, Mike.
- Hi, ma'am.

23:16.464 --> 23:19.066
I never said the pregnancy
story's out there.

23:19.067 --> 23:21.935
Yes. On the phone
you said the press

23:21.936 --> 23:23.937
"is saying that
she's pregnant."

23:23.938 --> 23:26.473
I said she's repugnant.
I said Selina's repugnant.

23:26.474 --> 23:29.577
What?
Why am I repugnant?

23:31.446 --> 23:32.980
Leon said it in reference

23:32.981 --> 23:35.583
to you firing
the secret service agent.

23:35.584 --> 23:37.652
- The smile story?
- Yeah.

23:37.653 --> 23:39.853
Why is that story
out there now, Mike?

23:39.854 --> 23:40.988
I don't know.

23:40.989 --> 23:42.223
Yeah, "I don't know."

23:42.224 --> 23:43.224
Really?

23:43.225 --> 23:44.659
Ma'am, if we just table this...

23:44.660 --> 23:46.628
I think we should just
knock off the kid thing.

23:46.629 --> 23:48.697
- Lower that.
- We need to get this over with.

23:48.698 --> 23:50.433
You know, I think we're ready.
Very excited for the kids.

23:50.434 --> 23:53.135
- Here, can you test this?
- Oh!

23:53.136 --> 23:56.005
Hi! Oh, Leon!

23:56.006 --> 23:58.341
So pleased to be shaking your
hand right at this moment.

23:58.342 --> 24:00.243
- It's wonderful to see you, too.
- Just delighted.

24:00.244 --> 24:02.879
Have you met Ken?
Ken, let's get moving.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.080
Right this way.

24:04.081 --> 24:06.449
Well, I'm so sorry
I was a little bit late,

24:06.450 --> 24:10.420
but I had to hang out with a
bunch of boring grown-ups.

24:10.421 --> 24:12.155
- Bugh. Boo!
- Boo!

24:12.156 --> 24:14.257
Boo!

24:14.258 --> 24:16.826
Mrs. Saunders,

the boys and girls

24:19.397 --> 24:21.966
have a song
that they wanna sing.

24:21.967 --> 24:24.101
Okay, kids.
Now, after four.
