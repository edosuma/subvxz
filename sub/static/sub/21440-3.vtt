01:10.487 --> 01:12.781
Lotor's cruiser
is on the other side of the planet.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.658
At our current rate of speed,
we'll be within attack range in an hour.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.577
Good. Hold formation.

01:25.084 --> 01:27.337
[grunts]
Oh, apologies, Hunk!

01:27.420 --> 01:30.006
Mm, is attacking right now
such a good idea?

01:30.089 --> 01:32.717
You know, since not everyone
is so great with their lions?

01:32.801 --> 01:34.803
Do you mean me, specifically?

01:34.886 --> 01:37.514
You? No. No way, I didn't--

01:37.597 --> 01:40.850
I'm just simply pointing out that more
than half of the team are in new lions.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.812
Maybe now's not a great time
to bite off more than we can chew.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.189
[Lance]  You can blame
our hot-headed leader for that one.

01:46.272 --> 01:49.734
First, you want me to lead,
and then you complain about how I do it.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.570
Prince Lotor is the heir
to the Galra throne.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.072
We could end his reign right now.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.492
Allura, you doing okay in Blue?

01:57.575 --> 02:01.371
I'm fine. I've been flying
the Castle for half my life.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.082
I just need a few ticks
to adjust to the lion.

02:04.165 --> 02:07.085
Good... because we're going in.

02:14.050 --> 02:15.969
[beeping]

02:20.306 --> 02:23.518
The lions will be on us in one varga.
What are your orders?

02:23.601 --> 02:25.770
I say we turn around and start shooting.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.690
We just learned
all five lions are operational.

02:28.773 --> 02:30.567
There's still much we don't know.

02:31.609 --> 02:35.113
Keep the cruiser on this heading
until my return.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.950
Ready my fighter.
I'm going to attack the lions myself.

02:39.033 --> 02:41.452
You'll never take them all out alone.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.122
I'm not trying to.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.083
I'm detecting movement.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.294
[Lance]
So much for the element of surprise.

02:58.469 --> 03:01.180
It's just a single fighter.
Where's the rest of them?

03:01.264 --> 03:04.475
Probably scrambling as we speak.
Let's take it out. [grunts]

03:16.696 --> 03:18.072
[grunts]

03:18.156 --> 03:20.408
[grunts]
Lance, what are you doing?

03:20.491 --> 03:23.369
Sorry! Red here is a lot faster
than I'm used to.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.830
Uh, where'd that fighter go?

03:33.504 --> 03:35.173
Come on, move!

03:40.136 --> 03:41.471
[groans]

03:41.846 --> 03:44.891
I can't shake him.
Someone get this guy off my tail.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.188
[Pidge] Coming in on your six.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.117
[groans]

04:03.201 --> 04:05.078
-Allura!
-I'm sorry, Keith!

04:05.161 --> 04:06.120
[gasps]

04:06.204 --> 04:08.998
Seriously, does this thing have brakes?

04:12.961 --> 04:14.045
[groans]

04:15.713 --> 04:16.964
[groans]

04:18.382 --> 04:19.926
[groans]

04:30.895 --> 04:32.188
Allura! Allura!

04:32.272 --> 04:33.940
[both yelling]

04:34.023 --> 04:38.611
Whoa! What's up with this guy?
He's playing us against ourselves.

04:38.695 --> 04:42.115
-[Keith]  It's gotta be Lotor.
-Ow. Allura, you okay over there?

04:42.907 --> 04:46.411
I'm fine, but these controls
are not responding, not like the Castle.

04:46.494 --> 04:50.123
What's wrong with you, Lion?
Do as I command! Move!

04:50.206 --> 04:52.959
Maybe someone should suggest
to Allura that flying the lion

04:53.042 --> 04:54.544
is different than flying the Castle.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.213
Hey, I already told her yelling
at her lion wouldn't work.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.215
Didn't go over well.
She yelled at me, too.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.051
Yeah, count me out. She scares me
when she's under pressure.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.262
-I can hear you.
-[all scream]

05:04.345 --> 05:06.222
[Pidge] Keith, what should we do?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.808
How about this?
Everyone stay out of my way!

05:08.891 --> 05:10.601
[sarcastically] Great. Great leadership.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.445
-[grunts]
-[lion growls]

05:21.446 --> 05:24.115
Okay, this isn't working.
We need to form Voltron.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.993
Everyone! In formation!

05:35.960 --> 05:37.462
Uh, guys?

05:37.545 --> 05:39.922
Guys, I'm not really feeling
that Voltron feeling!

05:40.006 --> 05:41.466
Keep going!

05:50.016 --> 05:51.434
It's not happening!

05:51.517 --> 05:54.312
[growls] What is going on?

05:54.979 --> 05:56.689
Guys! Fighter!

05:58.524 --> 05:59.776
[all grunt]

06:02.195 --> 06:03.696
How disappointing.

06:03.780 --> 06:08.284
It appears that the reality of Voltron
does not live up to the legend.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.537
[Lance] Well, that was embarrassing.

06:12.830 --> 06:15.750
[Hunk]  So... should we call it quits?

06:15.833 --> 06:18.377
Maybe go back, regroup, get a meal?

06:18.461 --> 06:23.925
No! I know everyone is struggling,
but we can't let Lotor slip away.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.179
Acxa, set course for these coordinates.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.932
I'm going to lure the lions there.

06:34.268 --> 06:36.854
Thayserix? Why?

06:36.938 --> 06:40.024
These are not the paladins
who defeated my father.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.026
[Ezor]  What? How do you know?

06:42.110 --> 06:45.780
They do not fight as a unit
and are unable to form Voltron.

06:45.863 --> 06:49.867
Perhaps my father did as much damage
to their team as they did to him.

06:49.951 --> 06:54.789
Whatever the case, they're vulnerable
and we need to take advantage.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.582
[Acxa] Recalibrating your fighter
to adjust

06:56.666 --> 06:59.043
for the atmospheric changes
on Thayserix now.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.463
What? What happens on Thayserix?

07:02.547 --> 07:05.842
The planet is made of dense gases
and has unusual magnetic poles

07:05.925 --> 07:09.262
that distort and wreak havoc
on normal sensors.

07:09.345 --> 07:13.224
Oh... So, once the lions are there,
they'll be blind.

07:13.307 --> 07:15.893
-No offense, Narti.
-[growls]

07:15.977 --> 07:18.521
Keep the cruiser in orbit
around Thayserix.

07:18.604 --> 07:21.524
I'll flush the lions out one by one
for you to capture.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.213
He's trying to hide from us.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.800
[Pidge]  We may not want to follow him.
We don't know what's in there.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.020
Huh?

08:01.981 --> 08:04.275
[Pidge's voice breaking up]
Guys, we have a problem.

08:04.358 --> 08:08.237
My sensors are going crazy. I think
it's due to this planet's atmosphere

08:08.321 --> 08:10.948
and what must be strange magnetic poles.

08:11.032 --> 08:14.202
We can't worry about that now.
I'm not letting this guy get away.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.913
[Pidge] Keith, without accurate sensors
or working equipment,

08:16.996 --> 08:18.956
we're not gonna be able
to tell what's up or down,

08:19.040 --> 08:20.666
where we are, or how to get out.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.544
-I say we fall back.
-No, keep going.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.756
-[Keith's voice breaking up] ...going.
-[Hunk] What? All I heard was "going."

08:26.839 --> 08:29.383
Are we going back?
Is anyone else getting this static?

08:29.467 --> 08:31.302
I'm losing visuals on you all.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.886
I need you to slow down!

08:32.970 --> 08:35.306
[Keith]
We gotta keep up. He's getting away!

08:35.389 --> 08:37.850
Guys, I think this gas is messing
with our radios.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.852
We gotta stay close
if we want to be able to communicate.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.162
[static crackling]

08:58.246 --> 09:00.623
I think we made it through
the worst of it. [screams]

09:05.461 --> 09:06.379
[static crackling]

09:06.462 --> 09:08.839
[gasps] No! No!

09:13.719 --> 09:14.845
[roars]

09:18.933 --> 09:22.812
-Allura took a hit. I'm going after her.
-[Keith] Hunk!

09:22.895 --> 09:25.690
[Keith groans]
The rest of you, stay on me!

09:45.209 --> 09:47.503
[Lance]
Keith, we have to go back for Allura.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.714
[growling]

09:51.340 --> 09:53.342
Keith, you're splitting up the team!

09:53.426 --> 09:56.095
Keith, don't do this!

09:56.178 --> 09:58.180
-[yells]
-[lion growls]

10:03.894 --> 10:06.814
Stop toying with them! Bring the pain!

10:12.194 --> 10:13.487
Is everyone okay?

10:13.571 --> 10:17.450
I'm sorry that I slowed us down,
but the Blue Lion isn't listening to me.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.119
It's okay. We're a team.
We stick together.

10:20.202 --> 10:23.706
-Isn't that right, Keith?
-It's not about the team.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.500
We have a mission
that's more important than any one of us.

10:26.584 --> 10:31.172
We need to find Lotor and stop him,
and I plan on doing that right now.

10:36.010 --> 10:40.348
[Lance sighs] Come on, guys.
We'd better stick together.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.989
[static crackling]

10:59.158 --> 11:02.328
[whimpering]

11:08.709 --> 11:09.960
[chuckles]

11:19.845 --> 11:23.265
Prince Lotor requires your assistance
on Planet Thayserix.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.018
We expect you here immediately.

11:27.395 --> 11:31.649
Lotor is right on top of the lions.
They have no idea.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.651
[Zethrid] Why isn't he firing?

11:33.734 --> 11:35.986
He could be tearing them
to shreds right now.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.656
-Blow them up, Lotor!
-He can't.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.909
The area he's in
is full of Red Syntian Nitrate,

11:41.992 --> 11:44.328
a highly combustible gas
that reacts violently

11:44.412 --> 11:46.038
to amplified emissions of light.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.793
[chuckles] This is gonna be good.

11:58.217 --> 12:01.220
This is crazy! We can't see a thing.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.721
Stay together.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.974
He's around here somewhere. I know it.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.309
There!

12:15.693 --> 12:17.736
-[Allura] Where did he go?
-[Pidge] No clue.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.572
Our radars are worthless in here.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.949
Hey, is it just me,
or does anyone else get the feeling

12:22.032 --> 12:23.617
this guy is just toying with us?

12:23.701 --> 12:27.079
I'm with you, big guy.
I'm getting a case of the heebie-jeebies.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.249
-He must have lured us here on purpose.
-Up there!

12:30.332 --> 12:32.001
[all scream]

12:37.882 --> 12:40.134
We need to get out of here.
We've been led into a trap.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.219
The tables have turned.
He's flipped the script.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.972
The hunters have become the hunted.

12:45.055 --> 12:48.476
Hunk, shouting taglines
is getting us nowhere!

12:48.559 --> 12:51.604
Lance is right.
Remain calm and get ready.

12:51.687 --> 12:54.064
He's gonna attack again.
Everyone, circle up.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.942
We need to be prepared for anything.

12:58.986 --> 13:02.615
As soon as you see him,
fire with everything you've got.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.255
Now! Fire!

13:22.510 --> 13:23.636
[screams]

13:26.388 --> 13:28.098
[screams]

13:44.907 --> 13:47.493
Hello? Paladins, help!

14:12.893 --> 14:14.728
I am impressed that you're able to hide,

14:15.312 --> 14:17.356
but I will find you.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.906
[panting]

14:28.409 --> 14:29.743
[growling]

14:33.664 --> 14:36.041
What happened back there?
Where's the rest of the team?

14:36.125 --> 14:40.129
This is all my fault.
I followed him right into this trap.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.465
Everyone warned me, but I didn't listen.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.302
I put the entire team in jeopardy.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.678
Yeah, you kinda did.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.389
But now we gotta fix it.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.894
You're right. Let's go.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.361
Hello? Anyone?

15:04.987 --> 15:07.364
[static crackling]

15:07.448 --> 15:08.824
[gasps]

15:08.908 --> 15:10.075
Oh...

15:11.410 --> 15:13.078
[screams]

15:13.704 --> 15:15.748
[Pidge's voice breaking up]
Is anyone there? Hello?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.626
Pidge!

15:18.709 --> 15:19.835
Hunk!

15:19.919 --> 15:23.130
Oh, my gosh! OMG.
I'm so glad I found you.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.716
Okay, what kind of computer-y stuff
can you do to fix the radar,

15:25.799 --> 15:27.509
find everyone
and get us all out of here?

15:27.593 --> 15:30.721
Actually, I can't recalibrate my system
without a data constant,

15:30.804 --> 15:34.391
which I could have gotten
had we not rushed into this gas planet.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.477
So, what are you saying?

15:36.560 --> 15:39.813
I'm saying... we're stuck.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.273
[gulps]

15:46.987 --> 15:49.990
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

15:50.074 --> 15:51.617
[static crackles]

15:59.667 --> 16:01.627
[sighs, inhales deeply]

16:03.379 --> 16:05.839
Okay. Stay calm, Allura.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.968
Think. What would Lance do?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.135
[exhales]

16:11.387 --> 16:13.138
Hey there, Blue Lion.

16:13.222 --> 16:17.476
You know, you're really activating
my particle barrier right now. [chuckles]

16:22.898 --> 16:24.441
Nothing works!

16:24.525 --> 16:27.861
I've tried asking you nicely,
and I've tried commanding you.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.406
What do you want from me?

16:34.535 --> 16:38.747
I can't do this. Everyone depends on me.

16:38.831 --> 16:43.961
The universe depends on me,
but I can't control everything.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.881
I... I need your help.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.300
[growling]

16:50.384 --> 16:52.469
[growling continues]

16:52.553 --> 16:54.555
[gasps] I can hear you.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.472
[grunts]

16:57.141 --> 16:59.727
[grunting]

17:27.128 --> 17:28.130
[grunts]

17:33.469 --> 17:37.765
Help me. Guide me. I can't do it alone.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.641
[beeping]

17:39.725 --> 17:42.144
[beeping continues]

17:44.730 --> 17:46.065
[growls]

17:54.740 --> 17:56.116
A sonar map.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.578
Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Blue?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.133
Someone's learning.

18:16.970 --> 18:18.722
Come on.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.308
Almost.

18:21.391 --> 18:22.893
Nitrate gas!

18:25.229 --> 18:27.856
Now, let's see
if this freeze ray works in here.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.076
-[grunting]
-[alarm blaring]

18:39.159 --> 18:41.537
I've lost control of the left wing.

18:42.579 --> 18:43.747
Well played, Paladin.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.215
We did it, Blue!

18:53.298 --> 18:55.884
Now, we need to find the other paladins.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.011
[Hunk] Hey, Pidge. Here's the scenario.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.721
You're stranded on a scary gas planet,

18:59.805 --> 19:02.432
and you only have one food to eat
for the rest of your life.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.892
What's it gonna be?

19:04.768 --> 19:07.855
Maybe a burrito? You like burritos, right?

19:07.938 --> 19:09.481
Mine would be a burrito.

19:09.565 --> 19:13.694
[Allura]  Hailing Pidge and Hunk.
Are you paladins looking for an exit?

19:13.777 --> 19:17.239
No way! You guys found us!
[laughs]

19:17.322 --> 19:20.242
Actually, Allura found you.
She found all of us.

19:20.325 --> 19:23.745
-She was able to connect with her lion.
-[Pidge]  Wow! How did you do it?

19:23.829 --> 19:25.873
I just had to get
into a Lance-like mindset

19:25.956 --> 19:27.332
and stop thinking so much.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.793
Yeah, think like Lance!

19:29.877 --> 19:32.421
Wait a minute! Are you calling me dumb?

19:32.504 --> 19:35.924
-No, I'm calling you a natural.
-Naturally dumb.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.634
Yeah, he was born with it.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.012
Look, I'm glad we're all
making fun of Lance,

19:40.095 --> 19:42.431
but we still have to find
a way out of here.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.766
Follow me. I know a way out.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.977
Wait a tick. Everyone, we have company.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.188
It looks like Lotor called for backup.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.815
[Hunk]
Oh, man. It's always something.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.403
[Keith]
We have to form Voltron.

19:56.486 --> 19:59.781
But we were not able to form Voltron
the last time we tried.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.575
We have to keep trying.

20:01.658 --> 20:05.037
We may have come here
fragmented and disorganized,

20:05.120 --> 20:08.373
but the only way we're getting
out of here is if we work together.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.334
This is our team.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.628
Shiro believed in us.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.463
We have to believe in ourselves.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.548
Who's with me?

20:16.632 --> 20:17.966
[all] Yeah!

20:18.050 --> 20:21.094
Now, form Voltron!

20:22.554 --> 20:24.014
[roars]

20:56.505 --> 20:57.339
[roars]

21:15.857 --> 21:17.276
[rapid beeping]

21:17.359 --> 21:20.112
I'm picking up an energy signature
I haven't seen before.

21:29.329 --> 21:33.041
-Hunk, I'm a leg!
-Pretty cool, right?

22:04.823 --> 22:05.866
[roars]

22:16.543 --> 22:19.212
[Pidge] Lotor's getting away.
Should we go after him?

22:19.296 --> 22:20.422
[Keith] No.

22:20.505 --> 22:23.633
Pushing the team too hard is what got us
in this mess in the first place.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.178
We'll face him again when we're ready.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.597
Roger that, team leader.

22:31.308 --> 22:35.854
Where are we going? Voltron is back there!
This is our time to fight!

22:35.937 --> 22:39.024
A leader must know
when to leave the field of battle.

22:39.107 --> 22:41.860
We'll face them on a day of our choosing.

22:41.943 --> 22:45.864
They can form Voltron, after all.
Will that be a problem?

22:45.947 --> 22:49.076
No. An opportunity.
