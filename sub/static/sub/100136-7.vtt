00:35.480 --> 00:36.640
Busy day?

00:36.720 --> 00:37.720
Not really.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.480
I've had a bit of a crazy one.

00:41.800 --> 00:42.880
Oh, yeah?

00:44.120 --> 00:45.640
Did you hear about the murder?

00:46.640 --> 00:48.440
Yeah, motel owner.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.520
Only an hour up the road.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.440
Nasty.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.120
Really?

00:54.640 --> 00:57.000
I can't really tell you too much
about it, though.

00:57.080 --> 00:58.080
Okay.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.920
He got shot through the chin.

01:05.320 --> 01:07.360
Blood... all over the ceiling.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.080
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.280
- Cleaner found him in the cupboard.
- What?

01:13.960 --> 01:15.440
Oh! Wardrobe.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.120
Whoever did it,
they hid the body in a wardrobe.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.680
- Jesus!
- Yep.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.280
Some weirdos out there.

01:26.720 --> 01:27.920
Daughter's birthday tomorrow.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
She's three.

01:30.640 --> 01:31.640
Right.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.240
Stay safe.

01:44.720 --> 01:48.440
<i>♪ The hoochie-coochie man
Oh, yeah ♪</i>

01:52.120 --> 01:54.840

Oh, yeah... ♪</i>

01:58.640 --> 02:00.560
<i>Control to Sid. Over.</i>

02:04.240 --> 02:05.840
Go ahead.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.640
<i>Where have you been?</i>

02:08.640 --> 02:10.480
In a shop.

02:11.560 --> 02:14.160
<i>Potential code two
in the cafe off Forest Road</i>

02:14.240 --> 02:16.600
<i>- up at the crossing. Can you check in?</i>

02:17.800 --> 02:19.080
I was on my way home.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.000
<i>Yeah, can you check in?</i>

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Roger that.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.520
How did you know where I live?

02:40.760 --> 02:42.040
James told me last night.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.000
<i>Thanks, James.</i>

02:46.440 --> 02:48.000
<i>This is pretty awkward.</i>

02:48.080 --> 02:50.800
<i>What do you say to someone
you abandoned in a car park?</i>

02:51.640 --> 02:52.800
Do you want a scone?

02:54.240 --> 02:55.240
Okay.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.160
<i>Maybe I should have been nicer to her.</i>

02:59.560 --> 03:01.240
Sit down. I'll bring it over.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.040
<i>She's pretty harmless.</i>

03:17.640 --> 03:19.080
<i>She's just strange.</i>

03:23.680 --> 03:25.800
- Can I have a glass of water?
- Yeah.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.360
Do you have ice?

03:30.440 --> 03:31.440
No.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.520
Shit!

04:14.400 --> 04:16.280
- Do you want some jam?
- No, thank you.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.360
I'm sorry we left you.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.120
It's okay.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.440
No, it's not okay.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.680
It's, like, a really shit thing to do.

04:40.120 --> 04:41.760
I've had a bad couple of days.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.160
Well, you've said sorry now.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.680
<i>Hello, emergency services.</i>

04:57.760 --> 04:59.080
Hello.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.280
Can you hear me, hello?

05:04.480 --> 05:06.720
If you can hear me, help!

05:07.320 --> 05:08.800
<i>- </i><i>Hello?</i>
- Hello?

05:10.800 --> 05:11.880
I need help.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.080
Oh, shit!

05:20.360 --> 05:22.440
- Did you see your sister?
- She was out.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.440
Is something wrong?

05:40.680 --> 05:43.760
I'd give it a minute in there.
Sorry.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.120
I thought this place was empty.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.600
It will be soon.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.600
Jerry's just a really slow eater.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.240
Are you okay?

06:21.880 --> 06:23.040
You don't look very well.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.120
I'm fine.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.320
Where's James?

06:38.640 --> 06:39.640
He's gone.

06:40.760 --> 06:41.960
Where did he go?

06:43.520 --> 06:45.760
I don't know.
I just know that he's not here.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.320
Well, you could phone him.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.720
What?

06:52.800 --> 06:54.200
You could get him to come here.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.200
Why would I want to get him to come here?

07:16.080 --> 07:18.320
Do you want to tell me
what's going on, please?

07:18.960 --> 07:19.960
I told you.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.080
I came to give you this.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.160
You left it.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.280
Well, I'm getting a divorce,
so I probably won't be needing it.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.040
And I wanted to see you both.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.840
Why? What for?

07:48.320 --> 07:50.160
I think you knew my boyfriend.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.400
What?

07:53.480 --> 07:54.480
Yeah.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.520
You killed him.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.240
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

08:10.320 --> 08:13.120
Lyss... can you put that on my tab?

08:13.200 --> 08:14.120
Yeah.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.280
I get paid Friday.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.280
- Okay.
- No, wait.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.280
- Thursday.
- Okay.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.800
Is Thursday the fourth?

08:22.880 --> 08:24.040
Jerry, it's fine.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.120
Thanks.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.160
All right?

08:28.680 --> 08:29.680
Yes.

08:32.520 --> 08:33.880
- Night, then.
- Night.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.240
You sent the bullets?

08:57.320 --> 08:58.320
Yes.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.280
Were you scared?

09:02.520 --> 09:03.520
A bit.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.360
You spelled my name wrong.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.040
What?

09:13.840 --> 09:15.240
Why did you kill him?

09:17.320 --> 09:18.320
Don't you know?

09:18.760 --> 09:19.920
I want you to tell me.

09:20.520 --> 09:21.920
Because he was gonna hurt me.

09:22.000 --> 09:22.880
Don't lie.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.000
I'm not lying.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.960
He was.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.360
Tell me...

09:29.440 --> 09:30.800
what you did to him.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.520
Tell me!

09:36.560 --> 09:38.160
We broke into his house.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.280
Whose house?

09:39.760 --> 09:40.600
You know who.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.800
Say it.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.480
The professor, Clive.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.280
We broke into his house.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.240
Why did you break into his house?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.320
I don't know. We were 17.

09:55.560 --> 09:58.400
We drank some of his vodka and his wine.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.480
We ate some of his food,

10:02.280 --> 10:03.600
put his records on.

10:04.680 --> 10:05.840
And then we went to bed.

10:07.800 --> 10:08.880
Then what?

10:12.440 --> 10:13.440
Then what?

10:15.360 --> 10:16.360
Then I woke up...

10:19.640 --> 10:20.880
and he'd come back.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.800
And he was there in the room.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.960
And he shut the door.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.440
You were in his bedroom?

10:32.320 --> 10:34.240
- Yeah.
- What did it look like?

10:35.440 --> 10:37.280
- What?
- Nothing.

10:39.880 --> 10:40.880
Then what?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.880
He asked me if I was a virgin,
and then he hit me.

10:44.960 --> 10:45.960
Shut up.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.080
He held me down,
and then he tried to get on top of me.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.480
Shut up!

10:51.560 --> 10:52.920
You asked me to tell you.

10:55.960 --> 10:56.960
Who's that?

10:58.320 --> 11:00.000
How the fuck should I know?

11:02.200 --> 11:03.200
Did you call the police?

11:03.240 --> 11:05.120
No, when would I have done that?

11:13.800 --> 11:16.400
Get rid of them,
or I'll kill them as well as you.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.720
<i>I'm definitely dying then.</i>

11:45.840 --> 11:46.840
Evening.

11:46.920 --> 11:47.920
Hiya.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Hello.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.040
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, fine.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.680
We um... had an emergency call from here.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.200
Was that you?

11:59.800 --> 12:01.360
No, everything's fine.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.040
Oh.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.160
Hmm.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.600
Must have been some kind of mix-up.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.480
Just the two of you here?

12:10.880 --> 12:11.880
Yes.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.800
Mind if I, uh, have a look around?

12:17.760 --> 12:18.920
Sure.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.520
- All fine.
- Yeah.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Right.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.720
I guess I'll be on my way then.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.600
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:54.880 --> 12:55.880
Wait.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.480
Is that apple strudel?

13:03.920 --> 13:05.240
Um, yeah.

13:06.880 --> 13:07.880
Lovely.

13:08.800 --> 13:09.960
Yes, please.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.720
You, uh, make that yourself?

13:18.800 --> 13:19.800
No.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.560
Ah.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.120
<i>I've never been so happy
and so sad to see someone.</i>

13:37.040 --> 13:38.160
I'd love it warm.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.760
Oven's broken.

13:42.960 --> 13:43.960
Right.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.200
Do you have any cream?

13:58.280 --> 13:59.280
Brilliant.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.120
Thanks.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.400
Mmm. Lovely.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.440
Hmm.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.160
Best be careful at the moment,

14:19.200 --> 14:20.200
out there.

14:21.040 --> 14:21.880
Yeah.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.720
Have you heard about the murder?

14:24.520 --> 14:25.520
What murder?

14:25.600 --> 14:26.800
Guy who runs the motel.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.840
Only an hour up the road.

14:34.720 --> 14:35.760
What happened?

14:36.640 --> 14:37.800
I shouldn't really say.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.400
He got shot in the head.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.840
And then put in a cupboard.

14:44.520 --> 14:45.520
Right.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.840
I keep saying cupboard.

14:49.480 --> 14:50.680
It's wardrobe.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.520
They put him in a wardrobe.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.320
<i>She wasn't having sex with him.
She was killing him.</i>

14:58.760 --> 14:59.840
<i>Maybe both.</i>

15:01.440 --> 15:03.920
Hmm. It's probably why
someone phoned about here.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
What?

15:05.640 --> 15:06.640
Mmm.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.080
Well, there's always hoaxes
and stuff, you know...

15:10.640 --> 15:11.640
after a murder.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.240
It's kids being silly.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.320
Calling us up.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Right.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.120
That was delicious.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.760
What do I owe you?

15:27.880 --> 15:28.920
Two pounds.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.240
Two pounds.

15:31.320 --> 15:32.400
Mmm.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.560
Here you go.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.160
Ah. Don't need that.

15:54.080 --> 15:57.240
What about...
for your expenses or something?

15:57.320 --> 15:58.920
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.240
Okay.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.200
Thank you very much though.

16:05.840 --> 16:06.840
You all right?

16:07.240 --> 16:08.400
I'm fine.

16:10.480 --> 16:11.480
Okay.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.600
Night, then.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.760
Stay safe.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.000
Oh, shit

16:42.520 --> 16:44.640
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

16:48.880 --> 16:49.920
Lock the door.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.440
You killed him?

17:09.880 --> 17:11.040
The man at the motel?

17:11.520 --> 17:12.840
Sort of.

17:12.920 --> 17:14.040
What?

17:14.920 --> 17:15.920
Where's James?

17:16.840 --> 17:18.240
I told you I don't know.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.240
<i>Please stay where you are, James.</i>

17:25.120 --> 17:26.120
What was that?

17:51.760 --> 17:53.200
I can see you.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.080
Come in, please. Please come in.

18:04.160 --> 18:05.400
<i>Go ahead.</i>

18:05.480 --> 18:09.200
I'm at the cafe on Forest Road.
Suspect is an IC3 female. She has a gun.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.560
Repeat. She has a gun!

18:15.640 --> 18:16.680
Unbelievable.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.440
Sorry.

18:18.880 --> 18:19.880
See?

18:21.440 --> 18:22.440
You're a liar.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.360
I didn't know he was there
until a minute ago.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.920
And why didn't you tell me?

18:26.480 --> 18:28.240
Because I don't want you to hurt him.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.400
So what now?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.400
What are you gonna do?

18:33.920 --> 18:35.640
I'm going to shoot you both.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.000
- Why didn't you already?
- What?

18:38.520 --> 18:39.360
Kill us.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.440
Because...

18:41.240 --> 18:42.400
Because what?

18:42.480 --> 18:44.680
- I wanted to talk to you first.
- Why?

18:46.760 --> 18:50.400
So I could hear it from you,
what happened.

18:50.480 --> 18:53.480
Your boyfriend tried to rape me.
So James stabbed him.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.800
What else is there to say?

18:54.880 --> 18:56.200
Why can't you tell the truth?

18:56.280 --> 18:58.280
- That is the truth!
- No.

18:59.240 --> 19:00.760
You were waiting for him.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.960
You broke into his house,
and you waited for him...

19:04.040 --> 19:05.920
- This is bullshit!
- Alyssa.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.840
- It is.
- She's got a gun.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.240
There were other girls.
You must know that.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.200
That was never proved.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.440
What? There were loads.

19:17.640 --> 19:20.680
There was a video and photos.
We saw them.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.760
You're wrong.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.360
It was different with me.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.960
How do you know he didn't have a plan?

19:30.840 --> 19:32.200
Maybe you were just lucky.

19:38.920 --> 19:39.960
No.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.600
No!

19:47.280 --> 19:48.440
He loved me.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.600
And you took him from me.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.480
You killed him.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.040
I... I killed him.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.040
Please, let her go.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.640
Fuck off, James.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.200
- What?
- Stop trying to save me.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.720
I don't...

20:04.680 --> 20:06.560
Yeah, we killed him.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.400
Then you have to get punished.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.680
People are supposed to get punished.

20:16.720 --> 20:17.880
You think we weren't?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.360
I'm always in that house.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.200
I'm always in that room.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.280
I can't get out.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.480
Maybe I did some things
I shouldn't have done,

20:31.560 --> 20:33.560
but I didn't deserve that.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.360
Please, Bonnie.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.480
None of us asked for this.

20:40.520 --> 20:41.520
None of us.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.720
<i>It's weird knowing
you're going to die.</i>

20:49.320 --> 20:51.280
<i>You feel like you're old,
and you know everything,</i>

20:51.320 --> 20:52.880
<i>so you don't give a shit anymore.</i>

20:53.440 --> 20:54.960
We're not gonna say sorry.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.600
You wanna kill us, I get that.

21:01.640 --> 21:03.160
But what happens next?

21:04.280 --> 21:06.720
- What happens to you?
- She's right.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.600
You might think
you don't have a chance, but you do.

21:45.920 --> 21:46.920
Bonnie?

21:48.400 --> 21:49.400
Bonnie?

21:57.760 --> 21:58.760
What do I do?

22:02.680 --> 22:04.120
What do I do with all the pain?

22:05.920 --> 22:06.920
I don't know.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.120
Okay.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.880
No!

22:16.640 --> 22:18.360
No!
