02:16.689 --> 02:18.894
- Hey, Andrea.
- Hey, Brandon.

02:19.065 --> 02:20.855
Did your pumpkin
have a litter or something?

02:21.066 --> 02:23.437
No, this is for the kids' party
at the Valley Youth Center.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.103
This way, each one has something.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.939
- Oh, isn't that sweet?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:28.155 --> 02:29.352
You love kids too.

02:29.531 --> 02:30.561
Guilty.

02:30.740 --> 02:32.530
Oh, how sweet.

02:47.793 --> 02:50.828
What's up, Scott? Why aren't you out
blowing up pumpkins or something?

02:51.004 --> 02:54.039
l had this stupid detention thing.
What are you doing?

02:54.256 --> 02:55.749
They're paying me
to make dance tapes

02:55.924 --> 02:58.461
for the Halloween party going on
at the old Brownstone Mansion.

02:59.301 --> 03:00.794
- Who's paying you?
- A couple of guys

03:00.969 --> 03:03.885
from West Beverly and Beverly High,
they just got together on it.

03:04.096 --> 03:06.467
l'm gonna go to the corner.

03:06.639 --> 03:09.508
You crazy? There's not gonna be
an egg fight this year.

03:09.683 --> 03:12.255
That's what the homeowners'
association wants you to believe.

03:12.435 --> 03:14.925
But Lockhart's gonna be there,
and Carlson and Wong and--

03:15.103 --> 03:17.094
And the place is gonna be
crawling with cops.

03:17.271 --> 03:19.843
Great. l love danger.

03:20.357 --> 03:23.689
That's right,
you're a real action figure.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.895
You don't kill a tradition just because
a few cops are gonna be patrolling.

03:28.112 --> 03:31.479
You should come.
lt'll be outrageous.

03:33.449 --> 03:35.275
l think l'm gonna go to the party.

03:35.451 --> 03:38.285
Half the girls in town
are gonna be there,

03:38.453 --> 03:41.536
dancing to my tapes.

03:41.746 --> 03:44.034
Well, if you change your mind,
you know where l'll be.

03:44.957 --> 03:46.581
- All right.
- l'll see you.

03:46.750 --> 03:48.374
Yeah.

03:52.003 --> 03:54.872
Well, you sure captured
the Halloween spirit.

03:55.047 --> 03:57.537
Halloween, bah, humbug.

03:57.716 --> 03:59.506
That's Christmas.
And you can't fool me.

03:59.675 --> 04:01.713
You're probably going
to the big Halloween shindig.

04:01.885 --> 04:04.209
Nope. Why, are you?

04:04.387 --> 04:06.094
No, l wasn't invited.

04:06.263 --> 04:07.507
Yeah, you know, l hate parties.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.672
You go there to socialize,
end up standing around

04:09.849 --> 04:12.802
in a bunch of smoke and noise,
screaming at people that you ''like.''

04:12.976 --> 04:14.090
You wanna leave, but can't,

04:14.269 --> 04:16.841
because you can't find the people
you're supposed to drive home.

04:17.021 --> 04:20.139
And l don't drink,
and l dance like a white guy, so...

04:20.314 --> 04:22.103
But if you wanna go, maybe...

04:22.900 --> 04:25.390
After that build-up, l wouldn't dare.

04:26.861 --> 04:29.066
Well, trick or treat.

04:29.946 --> 04:31.772
Trick or treat.

04:33.323 --> 04:35.729
l don't know. ln Minnesota,
we used to make our own costumes.

04:35.908 --> 04:37.899
l can't picture myself
going to Hollywood Costumes

04:38.077 --> 04:39.570
and renting something for this party

04:39.744 --> 04:42.364
that Joan Collins or somebody else
already sweated in.

04:42.538 --> 04:44.328
Well, l'm pretty sure
they clean them.

04:44.498 --> 04:47.367
Anyway, l'm renting.
So, what's Brandon going as?

04:47.541 --> 04:50.955
Oh, he's staying home.
He does the same thing every year.

04:51.127 --> 04:54.993
He dresses up as Dracula
and tries to scare the trick-or-treaters.

04:55.714 --> 04:57.919
And does he scare them?

04:58.507 --> 05:02.124
Donna,
picture Brandon Walsh in a cape

05:02.301 --> 05:05.882
with big, fake, plastic teeth.

05:06.054 --> 05:07.084
- Scared?
- No.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.293
- No.
- Girls.

05:08.472 --> 05:09.634
Hey, Kelly.

05:09.806 --> 05:12.474
So, what time is Andrew and T.D.
picking us up tonight?

05:12.642 --> 05:14.468
They just blew us off.

05:14.643 --> 05:15.805
Oh, no.

05:16.019 --> 05:18.057
They're going to some bash
in Malibu.

05:18.229 --> 05:19.770
What can l say? They're jerks.

05:19.980 --> 05:21.010
Great.

05:21.189 --> 05:24.224
The worst part is, two months ago,
we rented Lucy and Ethel costumes

05:24.400 --> 05:26.806
to go with their Ricky Ricardo
and Fred Mertz costumes.

05:26.985 --> 05:28.443
Now we're gonna look like fools.

05:28.653 --> 05:30.977
Well, l can't even get Dylan
to agree on any costume,

05:31.154 --> 05:34.319
much less carry a conga drum
and sing ''Babaloo.''

05:34.490 --> 05:36.363
So what?
You and Dylan already have,

05:36.533 --> 05:38.524
like, the best relationship
at West Beverly.

05:38.701 --> 05:40.242
Kelly, that's not true
and you know it.

05:40.411 --> 05:42.367
l know. But l've just been dumped.

05:42.537 --> 05:44.327
Can't l wallow in my own misery?

05:44.538 --> 05:47.491
Sure.
There's nothing like a good wallow.

05:47.707 --> 05:52.782
Mademoiselle Brenda, voulez-vous
carvez une pumpkin avec moi?

05:53.294 --> 05:55.618
- l may barf.
- Kelly.

05:56.255 --> 05:57.796
What time
does Hollywood Costume close?

05:58.923 --> 06:01.329
We'd better get a move on
if we're gonna find something new.

06:01.508 --> 06:02.538
Are you coming?

06:02.718 --> 06:05.671
Yeah, l'm curious to see that old
movie stuff. Dylan, are you coming?

06:05.886 --> 06:08.672
Why do l get the feeling you're
trying to talk me into a costume?

06:08.888 --> 06:10.132
l have no idea.

06:10.890 --> 06:13.344
- Got it, Donna?
- Let's go.

06:22.481 --> 06:24.638
Hello?

06:25.275 --> 06:27.432
Okay, l found it.
This is the one that you reserved.

06:27.610 --> 06:29.352
So did Lucille Ball
actually wear this?

06:29.527 --> 06:31.234
No, come on, Lucy never wore this.

06:31.404 --> 06:33.609
This is what you call
a Lucy-type outfit, okay?

06:33.780 --> 06:36.104
Just like this is a Ricky-type outfit.

06:36.282 --> 06:37.692
We got Lucy, Ricky, Fred, Ethel.

06:37.866 --> 06:39.359
- We got Fred and Wilma.
- All right.

06:39.534 --> 06:41.442
So Desi Arnaz
never actually wore this either?

06:41.619 --> 06:42.993
No, Desi didn't wear this.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.574
But if you're interested,
Gabe Kaplan wore this exact suit.

06:45.747 --> 06:47.406
Whoever. Look, the problem is

06:47.581 --> 06:49.489
that we don't have any
Fred- and Ricky-type guys

06:49.666 --> 06:50.993
to go with the outfits.

06:51.167 --> 06:53.538
- So is it okay if we just look around?
- Yeah.

06:53.752 --> 06:55.329
Just look around. Suit yourself.

06:55.504 --> 06:57.661
Hey, that's funny, huh?
Suit yourself.

07:01.341 --> 07:05.040
- Here it is.
- Yeah.

07:05.218 --> 07:08.217
You know, l always thought
that behind that mask and that cape,

07:08.387 --> 07:10.675
Zorro was just a rich kid
from Beverly Hills.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.046
Well, you know it.
Now let's find out who Dylan is.

07:13.224 --> 07:16.177
Hey, l know who l am,
and l'm not the dress-up type.

07:16.351 --> 07:18.177
Dylan, please, just take a look.

07:18.352 --> 07:21.186
Guys, l do not have to dress up
to have fun, okay?

07:21.730 --> 07:23.520
Come on, don't be a squeef.

07:25.774 --> 07:29.272
There's practically nothing left.
Everything's been picked over.

07:29.443 --> 07:30.770
Kelly, look at this.

07:30.944 --> 07:33.647
We could wear outfits
from The Wizard of Oz.

07:33.821 --> 07:39.026
Yeah? Munchkin number 4 7.
l don't think so.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.737
Well, yeah, maybe not.

07:41.910 --> 07:44.826
Don, hey, check this out.

07:44.996 --> 07:47.865
Oh, baby. Yeah?

07:48.039 --> 07:50.493
No, l really couldn't wear that.

07:50.666 --> 07:52.539
Sure you could,
you have a great body.

07:52.751 --> 07:55.157
l just don't have
what it takes to pull this off.

07:55.336 --> 07:58.335
And you do. See, the guys
would just crack up if l wore this.

07:58.505 --> 08:01.339
So l'm gonna go find something fun.

08:01.507 --> 08:04.839
Fine, l'll try it on.

08:10.179 --> 08:14.673
Dylan. l got it. You as Robin Hood.

08:14.849 --> 08:17.339
Oh, come on, Bren,
can you picture me in a pair of tights?

08:17.518 --> 08:19.593
Oh, can l ever.

08:21.395 --> 08:23.600
Actually, never mind.

08:27.816 --> 08:29.309
- Kelly.
- Yeah?

08:29.484 --> 08:32.519
- Don't you think it's a bit much?
- Bren, l don't have a date for tonight.

08:32.695 --> 08:35.315
lf l am going to this party stag,
l wanna make a splash.

08:35.530 --> 08:37.984
Well, you're more likely
to start a fire in that thing.

08:38.615 --> 08:39.942
Brenda, come on, it's Halloween.

08:40.116 --> 08:41.313
lt's the one night of the year

08:41.491 --> 08:44.408
when we get to dress up
and act a little crazy.

08:46.162 --> 08:48.237
Fine, l guess it's not
all that Halloween-y.

08:48.414 --> 08:49.991
No, but...

08:50.415 --> 08:53.249
- You guys, l got it.
- What?

08:53.417 --> 08:55.041
Well, it's a surprise.

08:55.210 --> 08:58.459
lt's kind of stupid, but l think
it could win for funniest costume.

09:00.630 --> 09:02.705
Whoa, man, this is righteous,
check this thing out.

09:02.882 --> 09:03.996
Look, look, look, look.

09:04.175 --> 09:07.174
- What is it?
- Bonnie and Clyde, man.

09:07.343 --> 09:08.505
So it is.

09:08.678 --> 09:10.551
Yeah, l bet Warren Beatty
even wore this thing.

09:10.721 --> 09:12.095
lt's not likely. l saw that movie.

09:12.263 --> 09:14.136
ln the last scene,
he gets riddled with bullets.

09:14.306 --> 09:17.305
Probably, like, a wardrobe backup,
maybe it was from a test or something.

09:17.475 --> 09:20.973
Yeah, well, whatever it is,
it's mine now.

09:23.479 --> 09:27.060
Hi, l'm Clyde Barrow,
this is Miss Bonnie Parker.

09:27.232 --> 09:30.185
And together, we rob banks.

09:44.118 --> 09:45.148
Mom.

09:46.704 --> 09:48.363
Don't you think the kids here
are gonna be

09:48.538 --> 09:51.372
a little disappointed with raisins?

09:51.540 --> 09:54.243
Oh, they'll get plenty of candy bars
at everyone else's house.

09:54.459 --> 09:57.209
l just wanna give them
something a little wholesome.

09:57.377 --> 09:59.333
l mean, let the other people
give them junk.

09:59.546 --> 10:02.296
Right. You know what they say,
raisins are nature's candy.

10:04.549 --> 10:08.296
l can't believe you just said that.
You don't even like raisins.

10:10.053 --> 10:11.297
- First customer.
- Okay.

10:11.971 --> 10:14.805
Yes, the first victim
to Dracula's castle.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.224
Welcome--

10:24.104 --> 10:26.938
Hey, Bugsy. What's the rumpus?

10:27.106 --> 10:30.224
This is a stickup.
Give me all your candy.

10:34.486 --> 10:36.193
Raisins?

10:38.531 --> 10:41.365
Hey, Bonnie, Clyde's here.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.446
Drift, small guy.

10:44.618 --> 10:46.693
Drop dead, ape.

10:50.705 --> 10:55.365
Nobody move,
or l will fill you full of lead.

10:57.377 --> 11:00.330
Get together, you two. l know
a photo opportunity when l see one.

11:01.296 --> 11:03.122
You look dangerous.

11:03.297 --> 11:04.755
So do you.

11:04.924 --> 11:06.038
l am.

11:06.258 --> 11:08.048
My daughter, the career criminal.

11:09.468 --> 11:10.878
Say cheese.

11:11.386 --> 11:14.136
Come on, look at this house.

11:42.407 --> 11:44.482
- Hey, not bad at all.
- Thanks.

11:44.659 --> 11:46.816
You look pretty good
yourself there, sweetheart.

11:47.036 --> 11:48.363
Oh, well, thank you.

11:48.537 --> 11:50.908
Don't put anybody's eye out
with that sword.

11:51.080 --> 11:54.447
l'll try not to. Hey, did you guys
see Kelly? Did she come with you?

11:54.624 --> 11:57.540
No, she had to make some
last-minute alterations in her costume.

11:57.709 --> 12:00.080
- Did you see it?
- No, it's supposed to be a surprise.

12:03.714 --> 12:05.836
Come on, Clyde.

12:06.507 --> 12:08.166
Guys.

12:09.884 --> 12:13.666
Donna, yeah, your costume,
it's really...

12:14.763 --> 12:16.920
- Really...
- Really long.

12:17.681 --> 12:20.597
Thanks. Oh, but can you help me?

12:20.767 --> 12:25.059
l'm kind of having a little trouble
walking in this thing.

12:25.270 --> 12:26.929
This thing right here.

12:28.272 --> 12:30.228
So, Donna, is this the real you?

12:31.024 --> 12:34.605
You know-- Okay.
--l don't really know, Bren.

12:34.776 --> 12:37.729
- l-- Hi.
- Look out, surf's up.

12:41.906 --> 12:43.364
Check it out.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.361
Check it out.

13:02.337 --> 13:04.459
Oh, my God.

13:07.674 --> 13:09.630
Kelly, what are you going as?

13:10.968 --> 13:13.209
What? l think l look great.

13:13.428 --> 13:15.918
- Did your mom see you like this?
- Brenda, lighten up.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.467
lt's just a costume.
l'm a friendly witch.

13:18.681 --> 13:21.799
Yeah, right, Kelly.
Glinda, the Good Witch of the East.

13:22.017 --> 13:25.266
l mean, do you want guys
staring at you like that all night long?

13:26.145 --> 13:28.979
What's wrong with that?
l wanna make an impression.

13:29.188 --> 13:32.104
You probably don't remember what
it's like having to meet guys, right?

13:32.274 --> 13:33.815
Oh, and that's
how you wanna meet them?

13:34.359 --> 13:36.315
Why? Doesn't it fit?

13:37.277 --> 13:38.391
lt fits fine.

13:38.612 --> 13:41.018
But l'm warning you,
you're looking for trouble.

13:41.197 --> 13:44.611
lf you wanna be Miss Goody-Goody
all night, that's fine. l don't.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.608
l've just been dumped,
it's Halloween,

13:46.784 --> 13:49.570
and if l feel like dressing up
any way l want, l will.

13:49.744 --> 13:52.412
l think l know how
to take care of myself by now.

13:52.579 --> 13:54.156
Fine.

13:54.331 --> 13:55.409
Thank you.

13:55.957 --> 13:57.747
Trick or treat.

14:11.009 --> 14:15.634
Welcome, l am Count Dracula,
l want to suck your blood.

14:15.804 --> 14:18.045
And who are you supposed to be?

14:18.222 --> 14:20.842
That's a Ninja Turtle, Mom.

14:21.015 --> 14:22.805
- And you?
- That's Donatello.

14:22.975 --> 14:24.005
The painter?

14:24.184 --> 14:25.891
No, Mom, the Ninja Turtle.

14:26.061 --> 14:30.223
Oh, of course.
Well, happy Halloween.

14:30.939 --> 14:33.227
You wanna trade?

15:03.795 --> 15:07.127
You'd better be good,
or l'll cast a spell on both of you.

15:10.341 --> 15:13.294
Wow, Kelly, you look...

15:13.468 --> 15:14.498
Don't l?

15:15.177 --> 15:17.845
What is it supposed to be,
some kind of gownless evening strap?

15:18.638 --> 15:21.044
lt's a witch's costume.

15:22.933 --> 15:26.265
Yeah, well, l thought those witches
wore those big things, like a cloak.

15:26.477 --> 15:28.931
l'm sorry if you have
a problem with it.

15:29.104 --> 15:32.269
l have no problem with it, it just leaves
nothing up to the imagination.

15:32.439 --> 15:35.688
Steve, with you and me,
it's all imagination.

15:39.110 --> 15:41.979
- Wow, Kelly, you look great.
- Thanks.

15:43.697 --> 15:48.571
So you wanna dance?

15:49.242 --> 15:50.404
Maybe later.

15:50.618 --> 15:53.653
Oh, okay, sure. l'll see you later.

16:04.336 --> 16:06.244
You like the music?
l picked it out myself.

16:06.421 --> 16:07.499
What do you mean?

16:08.756 --> 16:11.080
lt's sort of a cottage industry.

16:11.674 --> 16:12.752
Why?

16:14.885 --> 16:16.082
Do you wanna dance?

16:16.511 --> 16:18.088
No.

16:18.762 --> 16:22.509
So l guess a night of hot monkey love
is out of the question.

16:43.154 --> 16:44.481
l don't know about this party.

16:44.655 --> 16:48.153
l think l might-- l might be getting
too old for Halloween.

16:48.324 --> 16:50.446
Yeah, l know what you mean.

16:52.077 --> 16:55.112
- Remember the old egg fights?
- Yeah.

16:55.287 --> 16:56.449
Those were fun.

16:56.622 --> 17:00.321
l had a blast.
l've got such great stories.

17:00.499 --> 17:02.953
But that was all junior high school.

17:03.751 --> 17:05.328
Yeah.

17:06.837 --> 17:08.627
Later, Steve.

17:23.431 --> 17:27.048
Hey, David.
What are you doing here?

17:27.226 --> 17:28.684
Walking home.

17:28.852 --> 17:32.930
But l thought you were
really gonna rule at that party.

17:33.105 --> 17:36.437
Yeah, well, l got ruled out.

17:36.607 --> 17:38.266
Well, you're in time for the egg fight.

17:38.442 --> 17:40.232
Lockhart and Carlson
aren't here yet.

17:40.401 --> 17:41.894
- But as soon as they come--
- Scott.

17:42.069 --> 17:45.732
Lockhart and Carlson
were at the party.

17:47.239 --> 17:49.147
Quick, duck.

17:51.868 --> 17:54.239
Could be a cop car.

17:54.411 --> 17:56.402
But we didn't do anything.

17:56.579 --> 18:00.242
Not yet. But l've got plenty of ammo.

18:00.415 --> 18:04.363
Three dozen, grade A, extra large.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.915
You know what you look like?

18:07.336 --> 18:09.043
What?

18:10.422 --> 18:13.256
Like that time when you got stuck
in the doggy door.

18:13.424 --> 18:14.965
- You remember that?
- How old were we?

18:15.133 --> 18:16.413
Like, 8 or 9.

18:16.593 --> 18:19.130
All l know is you told my dad:

18:19.303 --> 18:22.006
''Just hold out a Milk-Bone
and he'll squeeze through.''

18:22.180 --> 18:27.338
No, no, no, it wasn't a Milk-Bone,
it was a Liv-a-Snap.

18:27.517 --> 18:29.888
- That was it, yeah.
- A Liv-a-Snap.

18:30.060 --> 18:33.392
And you laughed so hard
that that's how you popped out.

18:34.188 --> 18:35.930
God, that was classic.

18:36.106 --> 18:37.683
Oh, yeah.

18:46.571 --> 18:48.029
Trick or treat.

18:48.198 --> 18:49.525
Well, well, wellie, well, well.

18:49.740 --> 18:51.981
Aren't you doing well
for yourselves this evening?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.903
Come on, just fork it over.

18:55.744 --> 18:57.154
Okay, fine.

18:58.455 --> 19:00.328
All right, all right, all right.

19:00.498 --> 19:03.070
Here you go, one for you, one for you,
one for you, one for you,

19:03.249 --> 19:05.655
and one for you.

19:05.876 --> 19:10.086
- Happy now?
- Whoop-de-doo, nature's candy.

19:10.254 --> 19:12.210
Happy Halloween.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.888
Well,
feeling a little foolish right now.

19:33.061 --> 19:34.258
l thought you were charming.

19:34.479 --> 19:36.850
Yeah, well, thanks.

19:37.314 --> 19:38.392
What are you doing here?

19:38.607 --> 19:42.603
Babysitting my niece and nephew.
This is Lauren and Drew.

19:42.776 --> 19:44.933
- This is Brandon.
- Trick or treat.

19:45.153 --> 19:47.690
Well, l'm very pleased
to meet the both of you.

19:47.863 --> 19:50.566
Those sure are very scary costumes
you have on.

19:50.782 --> 19:53.947
- Emily made them.
- She cut holes in a sheet.

19:54.159 --> 19:56.945
Wow, wasn't that creative of her?

19:57.161 --> 20:00.114
What can l say? l love kids.
They're twins, you know.

20:00.330 --> 20:04.160
You know, now that you mention it,
l do see a striking resemblance.

20:04.625 --> 20:06.782
You know what, guys?
l'm a twin too.

20:07.001 --> 20:08.791
Show us your teeth again.

20:14.673 --> 20:19.796
- Candy! Candy! Candy!
- Candy! Candy! Candy!

20:19.968 --> 20:23.798
Brandon, is this a trick,
or are you gonna give them a treat?

20:24.763 --> 20:25.793
Yeah, right.

20:26.473 --> 20:27.587
Here you go, here you go.

20:27.807 --> 20:30.475
Mom, Dad,
you remember Emily Valentine?

20:30.684 --> 20:32.759
- Oh, sure.
- Hi, Emily.

20:32.977 --> 20:35.265
Hi, Mrs. Walsh, Mr. Walsh.
Happy Halloween.

20:35.479 --> 20:38.597
- Hi.
- This is Lauren and Drew.

20:38.815 --> 20:40.189
She's babysitting them.

20:42.484 --> 20:44.890
l thought we discussed
doing that before you left the house.

20:45.069 --> 20:47.475
l went before we left.

20:47.654 --> 20:50.357
- Mrs. Walsh, would you mind?
- Oh, it's not a problem.

20:50.531 --> 20:52.985
Come on, l'll take Drew.
You two can stay here and chat.

20:53.199 --> 20:55.523
And, Lauren, let's just try again,
just in case.

20:55.743 --> 20:59.739
- But l don't have to go.
- l know.

20:59.954 --> 21:01.495
Those kids are hysterical.

21:01.664 --> 21:03.454
They can be
a huge pain in the butt too.

21:03.665 --> 21:05.407
Especially when there's two of them.

21:05.625 --> 21:06.952
You tell him, Emily.

21:08.460 --> 21:11.662
Come on, twins are the greatest.

21:19.717 --> 21:21.507
l don't think so.

21:23.595 --> 21:25.919
Kel, l'm gonna go get a drink refill.
You want anything?

21:26.097 --> 21:28.847
No thanks, Steve, l'm mingling.

21:31.892 --> 21:34.845
Kelly Taylor? Michael Cetta.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.091
My mom knows your mom.

21:36.646 --> 21:37.676
That's nice.

21:37.855 --> 21:40.523
Jennifer Cetta.
Well, actually, it's Jennifer Sharp.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.558
She changed her name
when they got divorced.

21:42.733 --> 21:45.401
My folks, that is. Well, obviously.

21:45.568 --> 21:46.812
Actually, she knows your mom

21:46.986 --> 21:49.061
from when your mom was modelling
as the Farley Girl.

21:49.905 --> 21:53.486
You look really, really good
in that dress.

21:53.699 --> 21:57.113
You wanna go for a drive?
l have my dad's lnfiniti.

21:57.285 --> 21:59.490
And a bottle of whisky.

21:59.661 --> 22:01.071
l'll tell you what, Michael Sharp.

22:01.246 --> 22:02.324
- Cetta.
- Right.

22:02.997 --> 22:06.329
Why don't you take your bottle
and go get Daddy's lnfiniti started?

22:06.499 --> 22:09.333
Drive up the side of the house, know
where the driveway turns around?

22:09.543 --> 22:11.499
- Yeah, sure.
- Wait about ten minutes,

22:11.670 --> 22:14.753
and then put the car in gear,
drive to Santa Monica Pier

22:14.922 --> 22:15.952
and keep on going.

22:16.131 --> 22:18.039
See if that baby floats, okay?

22:19.091 --> 22:21.877
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly,
that was truly excellent.

22:22.052 --> 22:23.878
l was just coming over
to tell you Dylan said

22:24.053 --> 22:26.424
that guy is the biggest sleaze bucket
of the Western world.

22:26.596 --> 22:28.469
- l guess you already figured that out.
- Yes.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.253
Well, he made that point
pretty clear himself.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.508
l guess you do know
what you're doing.

22:34.185 --> 22:35.347
Thanks for the credit.

22:36.353 --> 22:38.179
So any luck?

22:38.354 --> 22:41.935
Well, the two guys over there
dressed as devils,

22:42.107 --> 22:45.770
one of them is kind of cute, but l think
he has his girlfriend with him.

22:45.943 --> 22:49.192
The skin diver has lots of possibilities.
Nice butt, anyway.

22:49.362 --> 22:50.903
But l'm thinking
there must be a reason

22:51.071 --> 22:53.062
why he hasn't taken
his mask off yet.

22:53.240 --> 22:55.611
Why take a chance,
you know what l mean?

22:55.825 --> 22:59.109
The Three Stooges aren't bad either,
but they're acting way too goofy.

22:59.744 --> 23:03.443
Did you see the guy dressed
as a feminine hygiene product?

23:03.622 --> 23:06.538
l'm not gonna say which one,
just look over there.

23:06.707 --> 23:08.248
Oh, my Lord.

23:08.417 --> 23:10.705
Exactly how l felt.

23:12.711 --> 23:14.786
Now, there's something
l could get used to.

23:15.546 --> 23:18.036
Oh, the tall, handsome stranger.

23:18.215 --> 23:20.965
Yes. Who rides into town
on a dark horse.

23:21.551 --> 23:23.673
Any idea who he is?

23:23.844 --> 23:29.382
No, but l will. You just watch, l will.

23:31.099 --> 23:33.423
- All done.
- Did you wash up?

23:33.600 --> 23:34.630
- Yes.
- Yes.

23:34.810 --> 23:38.936
Okay. l'd say it's about time
we got out of your hair, huh?

23:39.104 --> 23:40.894
So where are you going?

23:41.272 --> 23:44.474
Trick-or-treating. We don't exactly
dress like this every day.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.268
You don't?

23:47.401 --> 23:49.476
So come with us?

23:50.320 --> 23:51.482
You know, l'd love to,

23:51.654 --> 23:53.895
but l think l should stay here
and hold down the fort.

23:55.157 --> 23:57.943
Brandon, it's really okay.
l think we can handle it.

23:58.492 --> 23:59.902
Well, l don't want to impose.

24:00.118 --> 24:01.148
Are you sure?

24:01.328 --> 24:03.403
What do you say, guys?
Want Brandon to come with us?

24:03.579 --> 24:06.151
- Yes, yes! Take him with us, yes, yes!
- Yes. Yes.

24:06.331 --> 24:08.038
Well, how can l say no to twins?

24:11.376 --> 24:14.210
- Come on.
- Okay. Good nightie.

24:14.962 --> 24:16.752
Good night.

24:21.508 --> 24:22.586
Howdy, pardner.

24:22.759 --> 24:24.336
Hey there, witchy woman.

24:24.510 --> 24:26.087
Your horse outside?

24:26.261 --> 24:29.344
Hitched him right up
next to your broomstick.

24:29.514 --> 24:31.387
Thirsty after the dusty trail?

24:31.598 --> 24:33.175
Or does the horse drink first?

24:33.891 --> 24:36.844
Suppose you and l have a cup
of your witches' brew first

24:37.019 --> 24:40.184
and then we'll water my horse.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.306
Where do you go to school?

24:42.481 --> 24:44.022
West Beverly. Where do you go?

24:44.232 --> 24:46.686
- USC.
- Really?

24:47.693 --> 24:49.934
l bet at SC, you're quite the cowboy.

24:50.153 --> 24:52.903
l'll bet at West Beverly,
you're quite the little witch.

24:54.739 --> 24:56.481
You better watch it, cowboy,

24:56.657 --> 25:00.024
or l'll turn you back
into an obnoxious frat boy.

25:00.201 --> 25:02.157
Feisty, l like that.

25:02.328 --> 25:03.572
What, in a filly?

25:04.788 --> 25:07.278
Say, how about l just throw you
over my saddle

25:07.456 --> 25:09.993
and we ride off
into the sunset together?

25:10.875 --> 25:13.032
l don't ride on a first date.

25:13.210 --> 25:16.660
- Well, now, is this a date?
- Could be.

25:16.837 --> 25:18.627
How soon can we have
the second date?

25:18.839 --> 25:21.210
That depends
on how you play your cards.

25:21.424 --> 25:25.372
l always play my cards right, darling.
l don't like to lose.

25:26.135 --> 25:29.004
Feisty. l like that.

25:32.598 --> 25:36.096
Where do all these kids come from?
What do they do, bus them in?

25:36.267 --> 25:38.887
Yeah, as a matter of fact, they do.

25:39.061 --> 25:40.223
Why?

25:40.395 --> 25:42.885
Well, Halloween's
a big deal in Beverly Hills.

25:43.064 --> 25:47.142
People here put on quite a show.
Kids figure they'll get better candy.

25:47.317 --> 25:49.225
lt's a safe neighbourhood.

25:49.401 --> 25:51.938
l don't know, l'm not used
to such a big production.

25:52.111 --> 25:54.316
Yeah, l know what you mean.

25:54.822 --> 25:56.695
You know what l miss?

25:56.865 --> 25:58.524
What?

25:58.866 --> 26:03.443
Well, back in Minnesota, at Halloween,
the streets are covered in leaves.

26:03.619 --> 26:06.073
You know,
all the beautiful fall colours.

26:06.246 --> 26:08.451
You just kind of have
to shuffle through them.

26:08.623 --> 26:10.661
Up to your knees?

26:10.833 --> 26:12.575
You know?

26:14.085 --> 26:17.334
You gotta remember, Brandon,
l grew up in Cambridge.

26:17.504 --> 26:18.878
What l remember

26:19.046 --> 26:21.121
is the sound they made
when you walked through them.

26:21.298 --> 26:22.328
Yeah, like a shuffle.

26:22.507 --> 26:23.834
A crunch.

26:24.008 --> 26:25.632
Or a shuffling crunch.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.839
Or a crunchy shuffle.

26:33.973 --> 26:37.590
Lauren, Drew, give me your hand,
it's time to cross the street.

26:38.435 --> 26:40.343
Lauren, Drew.

26:40.519 --> 26:42.557
Lauren, Drew,
hey, come on, guys, let's go.

26:42.729 --> 26:43.807
Calling all ghosts.

26:44.480 --> 26:45.973
Now, guys.

26:46.482 --> 26:49.102
- Lauren?
- Drew?

26:49.275 --> 26:51.812
Guys, right now.

26:52.403 --> 26:54.276
Lauren. Drew.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.105
Lauren.

26:58.657 --> 27:00.364
Drew.

27:07.329 --> 27:10.245
l have no idea which way they went.
They were behind us a minute ago--

27:10.415 --> 27:11.659
- Don't worry.
- They were gone.

27:11.832 --> 27:12.994
We'll call this in right now

27:13.167 --> 27:15.205
and every car in the city
will be looking for them.

27:15.377 --> 27:16.835
Meanwhile, you search this area

27:17.003 --> 27:18.662
and check in with us
at regular intervals.

27:18.837 --> 27:20.710
- Right, will do.
- Don't worry,

27:20.880 --> 27:23.548
every Halloween we get
a couple of missing-kid reports.

27:23.716 --> 27:25.257
We haven't lost one yet.

27:25.425 --> 27:28.460
- What about that kid in Trousdale?
- Roger.

27:28.636 --> 27:31.470
Look, don't worry. We'll call your house
as soon as we have anything.

27:31.638 --> 27:33.795
Yeah, thanks, officer.

27:36.641 --> 27:39.676
Hey, hey, hey,
you heard the man, don't panic.

27:39.852 --> 27:42.223
What about that kid in Trousdale?

27:43.104 --> 27:44.301
- Lauren.
- Drew.

28:02.158 --> 28:03.817
Hi.

28:24.882 --> 28:27.336
Donna, can l ask you something?

28:28.051 --> 28:29.924
Why do you always
do stuff like this?

28:30.094 --> 28:31.124
Like what?

28:31.303 --> 28:34.302
Like wearing that
ridiculous dress to the spring dance,

28:34.472 --> 28:36.131
or dressing like a trout.

28:36.307 --> 28:37.587
You know l'm a mermaid.

28:37.766 --> 28:39.971
And besides, l was just trying to win
for best costume.

28:40.143 --> 28:42.893
What did you think,
Halloween was a swim event?

28:43.061 --> 28:45.681
No, l just thought it'd be fun.

28:45.855 --> 28:49.933
You know, every now and then,
it'd be okay if you were just yourself.

28:50.733 --> 28:53.483
Yeah, who'd wanna see that?

28:53.652 --> 28:57.482
l would, and most other guys here.

28:59.406 --> 29:01.397
l promise you.

29:13.332 --> 29:15.822
l can't believe
you're into David Letterman.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.327
Why?

29:17.501 --> 29:21.200
l don't know.
You just don't seem like the type.

29:21.379 --> 29:23.667
Well, l like to stay up late.

29:23.839 --> 29:25.795
Bet you do.

29:26.841 --> 29:28.998
Did we meet in another life?

29:29.176 --> 29:32.757
Yeah, we were ancient Egyptians.

29:36.806 --> 29:39.212
Lauren. Drew.

29:39.808 --> 29:42.298
Well, they are ghosts,
maybe they just turned invisible on us.

29:42.477 --> 29:44.634
- Brandon.
- l'm just trying not to panic, all right?

29:44.812 --> 29:47.100
- No.
- Hey, hey, hey, we'll find them, okay?

29:47.272 --> 29:49.228
- l promise. Let's go.
- l know.

29:49.398 --> 29:50.428
Lauren!

29:51.400 --> 29:54.483
lt looks like the egg fight
is gonna start a little later.

29:54.652 --> 29:56.442
l don't know, Scott.

29:56.611 --> 29:58.437
Can't you hang a little longer?

29:58.613 --> 30:01.185
Well, yeah,
l can hang if you can hang.

30:01.365 --> 30:04.281
Yeah, l can hang.

30:06.368 --> 30:08.406
Mom! Mom.

30:08.578 --> 30:11.068
- Mom, did the cops call?
- lt's the twins. We had them--

30:11.246 --> 30:13.154
- They're right here.
- They're what?

30:13.373 --> 30:15.744
- Well, look.
- Take you back to my castle.

30:17.125 --> 30:18.535
Never!

30:18.752 --> 30:20.957
They said you told them
if they got separated from you,

30:21.128 --> 30:23.878
they should go right back
to the last place they remember.

30:25.756 --> 30:27.249
You got lost.

30:27.424 --> 30:29.878
We were worried sick about you.

30:31.927 --> 30:34.168
We'll never do it again.

30:36.222 --> 30:38.925
l am so incredibly happy
to find you guys,

30:39.099 --> 30:40.925
you wouldn't imagine.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.135
- Were you scared?
- No.

30:44.352 --> 30:46.225
Oh, l let them start on
their candy bars.

30:46.395 --> 30:48.600
l hope that's okay.
They ate everything.

30:48.814 --> 30:51.138
Well, except the raisins.

30:51.315 --> 30:54.978
Mom, you got a little chocolate there.
Yeah.

30:55.151 --> 30:58.269
All right, all right,
next year we'll have candy bars.

31:06.868 --> 31:08.195
Scott?

31:08.369 --> 31:09.946
Yeah?

31:10.328 --> 31:11.358
What time is it?

31:15.749 --> 31:17.029
Eleven o'clock.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.455
You're thinking the same thing l am,
aren't you?

31:19.668 --> 31:21.706
This egg fight
just ain't gonna happen, is it?

31:23.337 --> 31:24.914
Nope.

31:25.922 --> 31:27.664
You know what?

31:28.382 --> 31:30.706
The good old days are over.

31:30.926 --> 31:33.546
Kids don't have fun
the way we used to.

31:33.761 --> 31:37.211
Times have changed.
And not for the better.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.305
You wanna egg a car?

31:43.935 --> 31:47.634
Sure, what the hell.
l mean, for old times' sake.

32:02.656 --> 32:05.146
Scott, Scott, Scott, hold your fire,
hold your fire.

32:05.366 --> 32:06.943
David, Scott, what's happening?

32:09.494 --> 32:12.826
Yo, Brandon. How's it hanging?

32:13.038 --> 32:15.076
What are you two doing
hanging around like slugs?

32:16.415 --> 32:18.572
- Nothing.
- What a waste.

32:18.792 --> 32:21.329
Where l come from,
we know how to have a good egg fight.

32:21.544 --> 32:23.085
Let's not encourage them.

32:23.962 --> 32:26.582
Beverly Hills kids. Rich wimps.

32:29.382 --> 32:30.959
Yeah.

32:47.103 --> 32:49.011
Donna, what's the matter?

32:49.187 --> 32:51.095
Oh, God.

32:53.399 --> 32:54.940
Dylan, excuse us for a minute.

32:55.108 --> 32:57.265
Just keep on dancing.
lt's all right, honey.

32:57.443 --> 32:58.605
Donna, didn't it occur to you

32:58.777 --> 33:01.065
that you just might have to go
to the bathroom tonight?

33:01.237 --> 33:02.896
l don't know, Bren, l just--

33:03.072 --> 33:05.906
l guess l just really thought
the zipper would work.

33:06.074 --> 33:09.488
Don't worry, Donna,
Brenda's here, l'll help you out of it.

33:09.660 --> 33:12.992
God, Bren,
l really hate this costume.

33:13.162 --> 33:16.944
Now l know why it was left over
at the costume store.

33:19.041 --> 33:20.285
Let's go get something to eat.

33:20.459 --> 33:21.573
Let's keep dancing.

33:21.751 --> 33:23.908
The music stopped.

33:24.086 --> 33:25.460
l didn't notice.

33:25.629 --> 33:27.336
Come on.

33:32.133 --> 33:33.710
Okay, l'll have a chicken wing.

33:33.885 --> 33:36.671
No, have these quesadillas.
They're much better.

33:36.887 --> 33:39.756
- l'd really rather have a chicken wing.
- The quesadillas are better.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.174
Trust me.

33:41.348 --> 33:44.846
Well, okay,
l guess l'd better listen, then.

33:46.351 --> 33:48.010
You know,
these are actually pretty good.

33:48.228 --> 33:50.303
You're damn right they are.

33:50.479 --> 33:52.684
- Oh, my.
- Hey, sorry.

33:56.066 --> 33:58.638
l wish there was someplace
we could go that wasn't so crowded.

33:58.860 --> 34:01.184
Well, l know just the place
where we can go.

34:01.403 --> 34:02.647
Follow me, little lady.

34:02.821 --> 34:05.655
Okay. Here we go.

34:09.742 --> 34:12.527
Wow, this place is really cool.

34:12.703 --> 34:15.371
l heard it used to belong to some
movie mogul way back when, but--

34:15.538 --> 34:20.163
Hey, Bewitched,
l'm not a big one for architecture.

34:20.333 --> 34:23.286
Tell me something
about your history.

34:23.460 --> 34:26.210
- lt's really not all that interesting.
- lt is to me.

34:27.504 --> 34:29.045
Well, okay.

34:29.214 --> 34:31.964
l was born here in Los Angeles,
lived in Beverly Hills all my life.

34:32.174 --> 34:33.667
Do you have a boyfriend?

34:35.010 --> 34:37.500
No, not right now,
but for a while l was--

34:37.678 --> 34:40.083
Are you looking for one?

34:41.722 --> 34:43.429
You know,
l really don't wanna think about

34:43.599 --> 34:45.554
anything heavy
or long-term like that tonight.

34:45.725 --> 34:46.839
lt's Halloween, you know?

34:47.018 --> 34:49.175
A night of dress-up
and make-believe, right?

34:50.312 --> 34:53.679
ln fact, they're probably having
the contest party right now,

34:53.897 --> 34:55.438
so we should...

34:59.818 --> 35:01.442
You like to play make-believe?

35:02.111 --> 35:04.268
Sure, everyone does.

35:04.821 --> 35:06.362
Great.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.196
Let's play make-believe.

35:24.585 --> 35:27.122
l don't wanna be up here anymore.
l wanna go back to the party.

35:27.295 --> 35:28.539
Well, l don't think you do.

35:28.754 --> 35:30.034
How do you know what l want?

35:30.214 --> 35:31.921
By your actions.

35:32.132 --> 35:36.839
l mean, if you didn't wanna be up here,
why'd you come?

35:37.010 --> 35:40.508
l wanted to be up here.
And now l don't, okay?

35:40.679 --> 35:42.670
l thought we were
gonna play make-believe.

35:43.348 --> 35:45.339
This isn't the kind of make-believe
l had in mind.

35:45.558 --> 35:48.641
Well, l'm looking at what
you're wearing,

35:48.810 --> 35:52.853
and l'm thinking this is exactly the kind
of make-believe you have in mind.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.101
The answer is no, okay?

35:55.606 --> 35:58.559
Okay, okay.

35:58.983 --> 36:01.021
Oh, wait a minute.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.186
l guess l'm...

36:04.362 --> 36:06.270
l guess l'm being
way too eager here.

36:07.406 --> 36:08.603
Yes, you are.

36:08.782 --> 36:09.944
l'm sorry.

36:10.158 --> 36:12.399
Really, l didn't mean
to lose my manners.

36:12.618 --> 36:13.648
Well, you did.

36:13.827 --> 36:17.526
Wow, l must have scared you.

36:18.747 --> 36:20.573
l think l scared myself.

36:21.207 --> 36:22.451
Good, you deserve it.

36:23.875 --> 36:27.657
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

36:28.629 --> 36:30.122
Look, can you forgive me?

36:33.298 --> 36:34.875
Let's just forget about it, okay?

36:35.091 --> 36:38.090
No, no, look, it'd mean a lot to me.

36:40.262 --> 36:42.218
l respect you.

36:44.765 --> 36:49.224
Okay, fine, you're forgiven.
Let's just go back to the party, okay?

36:50.435 --> 36:52.510
Kiss and make up?

36:54.063 --> 36:56.054
l don't think so.

36:58.899 --> 37:00.725
l do.

37:01.484 --> 37:03.808
Get off me.

37:04.195 --> 37:05.854
Get off me! Stop it!

37:06.071 --> 37:07.897
Cut the drama, prom queen.

37:08.072 --> 37:10.229
l'm sure this is nothing
you haven't done before.

37:10.449 --> 37:12.239
Get off of me!

37:14.243 --> 37:15.523
Get off of me!

37:18.829 --> 37:20.986
You know, l don't even care
about the stupid contest.

37:21.164 --> 37:22.574
Kelly, we're so sorry. We'll leave.

37:22.749 --> 37:24.787
Yeah, we're sorry.

37:26.001 --> 37:28.325
l'm so glad you're here.

37:28.503 --> 37:29.533
Kelly, what's wrong?

37:29.712 --> 37:31.538
- She's kidding.
- lt's not kidding.

37:31.713 --> 37:34.582
- We're playing make-believe.
- That's not true!

37:34.757 --> 37:36.748
He threw me on the bed
and he wouldn't let me up.

37:36.925 --> 37:38.584
- l tried to stop--
- Kelly, stop kidding,

37:38.801 --> 37:42.500
- they're gonna believe you.
- He locked the door, Brenda.

37:43.304 --> 37:44.382
You bastard.

37:44.889 --> 37:46.382
Dylan, come in here, l need you!

37:46.557 --> 37:49.806
You guys got this way,
way out of proportion.

37:50.017 --> 37:51.344
l mean, this is so funny.

37:52.102 --> 37:54.058
- What?
- He tried to attack Kelly.

37:54.270 --> 37:55.728
Hey, we were both into it.

37:55.938 --> 37:58.641
Then suddenly she started lying.
You guys know what l mean, right?

37:58.857 --> 38:01.311
How dare you lay a hand on her?
l love that girl.

38:01.525 --> 38:02.983
Hey, Steve, it's all right, man.

38:03.193 --> 38:05.861
Let's just take Dale Evans here
and show him the trail.

38:19.913 --> 38:21.323
Guys.

38:21.539 --> 38:23.080
Guys, you got this all wrong.

38:23.290 --> 38:24.700
l can live with that.

38:24.874 --> 38:25.904
l mean...

38:26.667 --> 38:28.575
When a girl dresses like a slut--

38:33.380 --> 38:35.502
You really don't have a clue,
do you, pal?

38:46.264 --> 38:48.255
l'm such an idiot.

38:48.557 --> 38:52.220
l thought l was being all sewy,
dressing like this, you know.

38:52.393 --> 38:53.767
Look where it got me.

38:55.062 --> 38:57.634
Kelly, l tried to tell you
that the dress was a little too much.

39:00.691 --> 39:03.062
lt wasn't the dress, though,
it was me.

39:03.234 --> 39:04.431
And what l did.

39:04.652 --> 39:06.940
Kelly, you said no.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.771
He should have listened, period.

39:09.905 --> 39:12.311
l should have listened to you.
You tried to warn me,

39:12.490 --> 39:15.774
you tried to tell me
what l was walking into.

39:15.993 --> 39:17.735
Kelly, you said no.

39:20.496 --> 39:22.037
l said no too late.

39:24.290 --> 39:27.076
Might as well have been saying yes,
you know?

39:31.795 --> 39:34.367
l was trying to act all cool
and everything.

39:34.547 --> 39:36.788
Talking sewy.

39:40.092 --> 39:42.463
l was leading him on.

39:42.678 --> 39:44.716
Well, then he should go
take a cold shower.

39:44.887 --> 39:46.297
Or whatever they do.

39:46.847 --> 39:50.297
Can l say something? l mean,

39:50.516 --> 39:52.721
l know the last thing you need
right now is another guy

39:52.893 --> 39:55.134
telling you what to do
or what to think.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.055
Go ahead, please.

40:02.191 --> 40:05.393
You're blaming yourself
for leading that guy on.

40:07.111 --> 40:09.861
But l want you to know, as a guy,

40:10.280 --> 40:13.778
it doesn't matter how much
of a magnet a girl turns on,

40:13.949 --> 40:16.190
a guy always has a choice

40:16.367 --> 40:21.074
of not making her do something
she doesn't wanna do.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.288
l didn't make that choice
very easy, now, did l?

40:30.460 --> 40:32.451
Yeah, you did.

40:32.670 --> 40:34.080
You said no.

40:36.631 --> 40:38.539
And after that,
what happened isn't your fault.

40:42.677 --> 40:45.048
l guess you're right.

40:51.975 --> 40:55.722
The weird part is
that before we came up here,

40:55.894 --> 40:58.265
he seemed like such a nice guy,
you know?

41:00.397 --> 41:05.472
Kelly, it doesn't matter if he's cute
or smart or Prince Charming.

41:05.692 --> 41:07.066
He was a rapist.

41:10.863 --> 41:12.190
Donna, l don't think--

41:12.405 --> 41:14.729
What the hell else can you call it?

41:15.407 --> 41:18.276
Kelly, what would have happened
if we hadn't come in here?

41:36.255 --> 41:37.832
Here you go, sunny-side up.

41:38.006 --> 41:40.460
Well, they're safe and sound.

41:40.633 --> 41:45.258
Yeah, probably in their little jammies
and fast asleep already.

41:46.303 --> 41:48.010
Brandon, thank you so much.

41:48.180 --> 41:50.883
l don't know what l would've done
without you tonight.

41:51.223 --> 41:52.847
Well, truth be known,

41:53.016 --> 41:56.051
if l didn't exist, you probably wouldn't
have lost them in the first place.

41:56.227 --> 41:58.551
True, but if you didn't exist
and l did lose them,

41:58.729 --> 42:01.349
how would l ever have found them
at your house?

42:01.522 --> 42:03.727
Well, l don't believe that.

42:03.899 --> 42:06.519
lf l didn't exist,
there'd probably be someone else.

42:06.692 --> 42:07.722
Maybe.

42:09.361 --> 42:11.851
But not someone quite like you.

42:15.156 --> 42:16.318
How can you know that?

42:16.491 --> 42:17.901
How can we know anything?

42:18.075 --> 42:19.983
Whoa, we're getting
a little philosophical here.

42:20.160 --> 42:23.823
Hey, you're the one
questioning your very existence.

42:24.580 --> 42:27.330
Well, to tell you the truth,
l never really gave it much thought

42:27.498 --> 42:29.655
until l just happened
to run into you tonight.

42:32.001 --> 42:34.407
Brandon, you didn't just happen
to run into me tonight.

42:34.586 --> 42:36.376
At least, not by accident.

42:38.339 --> 42:41.125
l knew where you lived,
l knew that you'd be home tonight.

42:41.508 --> 42:43.796
l came by on purpose.

42:49.055 --> 42:50.335
You are weird.

42:52.223 --> 42:53.503
But l like that.

42:54.934 --> 42:57.009
l'm a very peculiar person.

42:57.227 --> 42:59.302
Well,
l'm a pretty peculiar person myself.

42:59.478 --> 43:00.508
No.

43:00.729 --> 43:03.135
You are frighteningly normal.

43:03.940 --> 43:05.931
But l like that.

43:08.818 --> 43:10.893
So you wanna go
to the Halloween party?

43:11.486 --> 43:13.027
We don't have any costumes.

43:13.613 --> 43:14.643
No problem.

43:14.822 --> 43:18.024
We'll just say we're another couple,
going as Brandon and Emily.

43:18.992 --> 43:22.276
Hey, just think how impressed
they'll be with our masks.

43:23.703 --> 43:27.651
Well, l'm pretty impressed
with your mask already.

43:46.844 --> 43:49.464
Steve, l'll never forget
what you did for me tonight.

43:49.637 --> 43:53.384
Good, because l meant what l said.

43:55.141 --> 43:56.967
l know you did.

44:13.237 --> 44:14.399
Hey, where's the party?

44:14.613 --> 44:17.696
lt's been a long time since l heard
my brother say, ''Where's the party?''

44:17.907 --> 44:20.906
Well, it's been quite a long time
since l've had any reason to say it.

44:21.117 --> 44:23.867
Yeah, well, you're just a little
out of shape. Stick around, champ.

44:24.036 --> 44:27.285
Hey, we're gonna go to the Peach Pit
and unwind. Do you wanna join us?

44:27.455 --> 44:30.075
Well, how long has it been
since we've been at the Peach Pit?

44:30.249 --> 44:31.742
- Minutes.
- At least.

44:31.958 --> 44:34.282
- Let's go.
- Sure, see you there.

44:34.460 --> 44:37.459
Well, wait. You guys, can we drop
this mermaid thing off first?

44:37.629 --> 44:39.751
No, let's keep the mermaid thing.
l like it.

44:39.922 --> 44:42.246
Mermaids
are an endangered species.

44:42.423 --> 44:45.209
Can we stop by the bank first?

44:45.384 --> 44:48.917
Absolutely. Let's go.
