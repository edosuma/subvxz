WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:05.699
(xylophone playing softly)

00:39.370 --> 00:41.395
DEEJAY:
You've been listening
to Carl Orff's

00:41.440 --> 00:43.567
"Vier Stucke fur Xylophon."

00:43.610 --> 00:47.102
Xylophones and pan flutes
are healing instruments

00:47.140 --> 00:50.075
best played as a detox
from the intensity of the clay.

00:50.110 --> 00:51.247
Shut up.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.612
(sighs)

01:03.490 --> 01:05.481
No.

01:23.380 --> 01:26.144
(chuckles)

01:26.180 --> 01:27.442
Elsbeth, I'm going into court.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.118
It's too late to change
trial strategy.

01:29.150 --> 01:31.311
You can't win
by fighting sexism.

01:31.350 --> 01:35.116
They're charging sexism. Are you
saying I can't refute it?

01:35.160 --> 01:36.457
No. Yes.

01:36.490 --> 01:39.493
I mean the plaintiff
has a broken iPhone.

01:40.530 --> 01:43.522
Okay. And why is that important?

01:43.570 --> 01:44.821
Because her office
sent over files

01:44.870 --> 01:46.394
with ﬁve different buck slips.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.237
Five different assistants.

01:48.270 --> 01:49.532
RAYNA:
Mr. Napier, hello.

01:49.570 --> 01:52.471
This is my law partner,
Elsbeth Tascioni.

01:52.510 --> 01:54.603
She'll be my
second chair today.
That's my general counsel.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.244
He's advising me to settle,
Ms. Hecht.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.498
ELSBETH:
Oh, no. You can't.

01:58.550 --> 02:01.314
Our worry is the makeup of the
plaintiff's team. We've looked

02:01.350 --> 02:03.545
at their wins and losses...
That just makes them
overconfident.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.615
Just give us today.

02:05.650 --> 02:07.379
Then we can decide
whether to settle.
Okay, I have business

02:07.420 --> 02:08.887
with the governor's office,
and their lead attorney

02:08.920 --> 02:09.887
is the governor's wife.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.592
What?!

02:12.630 --> 02:14.222
Alicia!

02:14.260 --> 02:16.569
I didn't know you were on this.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.158
I didn't know either.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.168
But I guess I am.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.736
Hi.

02:21.770 --> 02:24.466
Hi.

02:25.510 --> 02:26.772
Who's that?

02:26.810 --> 02:28.630
Elsbeth Tascioni.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.341
Is she good?

02:30.380 --> 02:31.870
Yep.

02:31.910 --> 02:33.741
Well, I like the talent pool
at J-Serve.

02:33.780 --> 02:38.240
I also believe that there aren't
enough women CEOs

02:38.290 --> 02:40.508
in the tech business.
So when they approached me,

02:40.560 --> 02:42.653
I said yes.
And in the three years

02:42.690 --> 02:44.885
you served as CEO at J-Serve,
what happened

02:44.930 --> 02:47.319
to the share price?
It doubled.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.897
DEAN: So, uh, despite this
unprecedented success

02:49.930 --> 02:52.660
and a mere two weeks
before your options vested,

02:52.700 --> 02:54.964
you were
unceremoniously terminated?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.900
RAYNA: Objection,
Your Honor,

02:56.940 --> 02:58.931
to "unprecedented success."
Calls for a conclusion.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.904
That it does. Sustained.

03:00.940 --> 03:02.874
Were you given any reason
for your firing?

03:02.910 --> 03:05.708
Mr. Napier told me
that my brash management style

03:05.750 --> 03:07.968
_ was inconsistent
With the company's culture.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.409
DEAN:
So you're suing them.
Yes.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.759
They fired me
because I'm a woman.

03:12.790 --> 03:14.815
And they can't do that.

03:14.860 --> 03:16.680
DEAN:
Thank you.

03:19.030 --> 03:23.228
Ms. Vargas, how would you
describe your relationship

03:23.270 --> 03:24.897
with your subordinates?

03:24.930 --> 03:26.761
How would I desc...

03:26.800 --> 03:27.994
I-I don't know, um... effective.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.667
Ms. Vargas,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.530
how many aides have you had
in the last two months?

03:31.570 --> 03:33.777
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

03:33.810 --> 03:35.937
Ms. Vargas claims that she was
fired due to sexism.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.004
We_ believe there's_ a
far Simpler explanation.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.006
I guess I will...

03:39.050 --> 03:41.018
No, I know I
will overrule.

03:41.050 --> 03:43.314
Ms. Vargas, how many aides?

03:43.350 --> 03:45.318
I don't know. Five.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.386
Five assistants
in the last two months?

03:47.420 --> 03:49.012
It's very hard
to find good help.

03:49.060 --> 03:50.687
(scoffs, snorts)

03:50.730 --> 03:53.028
Your Honor,
please ask the defense

03:53.060 --> 03:55.392
to_ restrain itself.
Restraln yourself, ma'am.

03:55.430 --> 03:56.419
RAYNA:
Ms. Vargas,

03:56.470 --> 03:58.426
have you thrown your cell phone

03:58.470 --> 04:00.768
at your assistants?
ALICIA:
Objection, Your Honor.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.030
ELSBETH and RAYNA:
Goes to management skills.

04:03.070 --> 04:05.709
Yes. Overruled.

04:05.740 --> 04:06.877
You may answer, ma'am.

04:06.910 --> 04:08.400
Look, women
are called bitches

04:08.440 --> 04:10.340
when they have
a tough management style.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.679
I admit I have
a tough management style,

04:13.720 --> 04:15.779
but I am fair.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.549
That was a good
pivot on their part.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.558
Yep, it's no longer
about sexism.

04:19.590 --> 04:21.410
It's about our client
being a bitch.

04:21.460 --> 04:24.349
So we make it about
the CEO before her.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.028
Compare their behavior.

04:26.060 --> 04:29.666
Yeah, he's the same
and they didn't fire him.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.827
Diane, you knew the CEO before
Camilla. What was his name?

04:31.870 --> 04:34.031
Um, Everett Tatum.

04:34.070 --> 04:37.836
Wasn't there a sexual harassment
swt against hIm?
There was.

04:37.870 --> 04:39.838
I'll e-mail it to you.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.992
VVhoa!

05:01.030 --> 05:02.054
What?!

05:02.100 --> 05:03.089
(groans)

05:03.130 --> 05:05.098
Computers are down.
Who did it?

05:05.130 --> 05:07.360
What happened?
What's going on here?

05:07.400 --> 05:09.038
Dean, Alicia.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.070
"Wire a payment of $50,000

05:14.110 --> 05:16.704
"to the following account number
within 72 hours

05:16.750 --> 05:19.617
"or the decryption key will be
destroyed and your files

05:19.650 --> 05:22.448
permanently lost."
(groans)
Ransomware.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.708
It was an e-mail from Alicia.
I just clicked on it.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.456
I-I didn't send you anything.

05:26.490 --> 05:29.823
(groans)

05:29.860 --> 05:31.987
I just lost my deposition...!
MAN: Need some help here!

05:32.030 --> 05:33.395
WOMAN:
My computer's frozen!

05:33.430 --> 05:36.558
This isn't good.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.693
It's everything.
All our backup files,

05:38.730 --> 05:40.698
all our accounts.
Everything's lost.
DEAN: We're due in court

05:40.740 --> 05:42.708
in an hour and we can't
get our trIal notes.

05:42.740 --> 05:44.002
What happens if we don't pay?
CAREY:
Everything gets deleted

05:44.040 --> 05:45.860
in 72 hours.
71 hours.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.571
It's on our laptops, too?

05:47.610 --> 05:49.646
Everything's
on the same network.
That's insane.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.569
This is like modern day piracy.
Where's Cary?
Here.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.110
No, Agos, Cary.
Uh, he's at lunch.

05:54.150 --> 05:55.674
I'll conference him in.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.579
(phone ringing)

05:59.620 --> 06:03.056
It's your phone.
Yep.

06:03.090 --> 06:04.785
Uh...

06:04.830 --> 06:06.752
They know I'm at lunch.
It can't be good news.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.654
Well, maybe they're dropping
the charges against you.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.388
It's Cary.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.361
ALICIA:
Cary, we've had

06:13.400 --> 06:15.664
a malware attack.
All our computers are down.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.463
They're asking
for $50,000

06:17.510 --> 06:21.139
or we lose all our files
In 71 hours.
What?

06:21.180 --> 06:22.329
Wait, we need to
loop Kalinda in.

06:22.380 --> 06:24.644
They're calling you, they're
calling... they're calling you.

06:24.680 --> 06:25.647
(phone ringing)
Mute your phone.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.069
Where is it?
I don't know.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.715
(ringing continues)

06:31.750 --> 06:33.786
What about the backup files?

06:33.820 --> 06:35.788
Oh, yeah.
We can restore from backup.

06:35.820 --> 06:37.788
Hi. This is Kalinda.
DIANE:
Kalinda, it's me.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.752
I inadvertently downloaded
a virus.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.825
The instructions say we need

06:41.860 --> 06:43.794
to make a payment
of $50,000.

06:43.830 --> 06:46.094
And we don't have a backup.
What do you mean we
don't have any backup?

06:46.130 --> 06:48.132
We were contracting
for an outside I.T. redesign,

06:48.170 --> 06:50.764
but we had to use the money
for... something else.

06:50.810 --> 06:52.698
My bail.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.469
Look, what's the time frame?

06:54.510 --> 06:56.137
DIANE:
71 hours.

06:56.180 --> 06:58.808
Okay, I'll look into it.
ALICIA:
We don't have time.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.818
We're in court.
They are holding
our case files ransom.

07:00.850 --> 07:02.738
We have to pay.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.917
$50,000? Seriously?
We don't_have
any option,

07:04.950 --> 07:06.884
all right? It's our files...

07:06.920 --> 07:08.979
We could contact
the authorities.
And then what?

07:09.020 --> 07:10.988
The investigation leaks
and the whole legal community

07:11.030 --> 07:13.624
knows we're vulnerable.
DEAN:
Clients will leave.

07:13.660 --> 07:15.753
Camilla could even sue us
if she thinks this impacts

07:15.800 --> 07:17.529
her representation.
ALICIA:
Which it might.

07:17.570 --> 07:18.867
DEAN:
I'm with Alicia.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.697
We need to pay up.
Kalinda,

07:20.740 --> 07:21.832
is there anything to do?
Look, I don't like

07:21.870 --> 07:24.703
funding a criminal operation.
I know. And if this were

07:24.740 --> 07:26.537
Lockhart/Gardner,
we would have other options.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.774
I just don't see any.

07:27.810 --> 07:30.699
Where does the $50,000
come from?
All of us.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.718
All of the partners,
$5,000 each in two hours.

07:32.750 --> 07:33.717
I agree with Diane.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.913
(phone rings)
(others murmuring, protesting)

07:36.950 --> 07:38.713
Finn, hi.

07:38.750 --> 07:39.717
Wow, you sound anxious.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.909
Yeah.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.780
Firm politics.
So I considered it

07:42.830 --> 07:44.889
carefully and I'd be honored

07:44.930 --> 07:46.727
to offer a few remarks
on your behalf

07:46.760 --> 07:48.648
when you announce
your candidacy.
Are you sure?

07:48.700 --> 07:50.861
Uh, that won't hurt you there?
I don't know.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.265
I'm not sure of anything
these days.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.564
I like living on the edge.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.830
(chuckles)
Me, too.

07:56.870 --> 07:58.906
IfI fall, you'll catch me?
No, I'll be plummeting with you.

07:58.940 --> 08:00.601
ALICIA: Who was
your chief executive officer

08:00.640 --> 08:02.574
before Camilla?

08:02.610 --> 08:03.907
Everett Tatum,

08:03.950 --> 08:05.008
a very capable
executive.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.870
You didn't fire Mr. Tatum,
did you?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.876
No, there was no reason to.
Because his brash

08:08.920 --> 08:11.889
management style didn't clash
with the company's culture?

08:11.920 --> 08:14.889
Well, he didn't make us
vulnerable to a lawsuit.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.888
They're going after equivalence.
This is

08:16.930 --> 08:17.885
an employee complaint

08:17.930 --> 08:19.818
_ filed
against Everett Tatum

08:19.860 --> 08:22.226
for sexual harassment.
Have you seen this?

08:22.260 --> 08:23.522
No.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.060
You were CC'd there.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.294
Do you see?

08:26.330 --> 08:28.935
Mr. Tatum
wasn't fired,

08:28.970 --> 08:30.062
was he?
No.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.238
In fact, two months after
this incident, you offered him

08:33.280 --> 08:34.872
a 20% raise, didn't you?

08:34.910 --> 08:36.901
So a white male

08:36.950 --> 08:38.872
is rewarded for
the same behavior that...

08:38.910 --> 08:39.740
Objection, Your Honor.
What is she
objecting to?

08:39.780 --> 08:41.179
I haven't finished
the question yet.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.244
Go ahead.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.918
A white male is rewarded

08:43.950 --> 08:45.884
for the same behavior

08:45.920 --> 08:47.911
that leads to a woman's firing.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.258
Objection.
I'll withdraw.

08:50.290 --> 08:52.952
Thank you, sir.

08:53.000 --> 08:53.955
(whispering)

08:54.000 --> 08:56.924
(groans)
Now what?

08:56.970 --> 08:58.892
ALICIA: I can't even
begin to guess.

08:58.930 --> 09:00.898
Mr. Napier,

09:00.940 --> 09:03.829
isn't it true
that Mr. Everett's...

09:03.870 --> 09:06.338
Excuse me.
What was his last name?

09:06.370 --> 09:07.598
The previous CEO?

09:07.640 --> 09:08.971
Mr. Tatum.
Right.

09:09.010 --> 09:11.877
Isn't it true
that whatever he did,

09:11.910 --> 09:13.912
you became concerned
about the next CEO

09:13.950 --> 09:15.975
repeating that behavior?

09:16.020 --> 09:17.681
NAPIER:
I'm sorry, what?

09:17.720 --> 09:19.688
Well, the defense
is trying to suggest

09:19.720 --> 09:22.985
_ there_ was sexism_
in your firing of Camilla.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.123
I like that brooch.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.993
They're suggesting there
was sexism in firing her

09:28.030 --> 09:31.796
and not firing the male CEO
for the exact same actions.

09:31.830 --> 09:35.937
Didn't the misbehavior
of the Mr. Other CEO Guy

09:35.970 --> 09:39.007
just sensitize you
to not letting Camilla do

09:39.040 --> 09:40.837
the same thing and encourage you
to say, "Never again"?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.370
ALICIA:
Objection.

09:42.410 --> 09:44.970
That is the definition
of leading.

09:45.010 --> 09:46.944
Yes. I will sustain that.

09:46.980 --> 09:49.847
So, why did you fire Camilla?

09:49.890 --> 09:50.982
Well...

09:51.020 --> 09:53.853
because we said, "Never again."

09:53.890 --> 09:55.357
ELSBETH:
Thank you, sir.

09:55.390 --> 09:57.085
We need to take her out.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.976
And just like that,

10:17.010 --> 10:20.241
we turn $50,000 in cash
into zeroes and ones.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.919
Who knew Bitcoin would
come in so handy?

10:22.950 --> 10:24.087
How are you entering it?

10:24.120 --> 10:28.056
I type in my nine-digit
routing number

10:28.090 --> 10:31.253
and they e-mail me
the decryption key.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.019
Okay.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.927
How long do we wait?
I don't know.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.961
It says simultaneously.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.065
Something's wrong.
DIANE:
So what do we do?

10:43.110 --> 10:46.034
Bottom of the page,
there's a helpline number.

10:46.070 --> 10:47.071
DIANE:
There's a helpline

10:47.110 --> 10:49.169
for ransomware?
That's helpful

10:49.210 --> 10:50.279
of the criminals.

10:53.850 --> 10:54.874
MAN (recorded):
Thank you for calling

10:54.920 --> 10:56.171
the Trojanlock help desk.

10:56.220 --> 10:59.041
At present, we are assisting
other customers.

10:59.090 --> 11:01.888
Please have your routing number
ready, and you will be assisted

11:01.920 --> 11:03.353
in the order you called.
DIANE: Amazing.

11:03.390 --> 11:05.927
Uh, Kalinda...

11:05.960 --> 11:07.359
see what you can do.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.267
Okay.

11:10.300 --> 11:13.929
Okay.
I've re-tabbed the depo
testimony for the rest

11:13.970 --> 11:17.337
of our cross-exams.
Wow, this must have
been what it was like

11:17.370 --> 11:20.009
to practice law
before computers.
Yup.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.941
So, Camilla-- she really
fired five of her assistants?

11:22.980 --> 11:24.470
I can say this
because I'm a woman,

11:24.510 --> 11:26.341
but she's probably
a bitch on wheels.

11:26.380 --> 11:28.871
But her behavior wouldn't
even be a talking point

11:28.920 --> 11:30.182
if she were a man.

11:30.220 --> 11:32.381
Do you really want to
compare experiences of bias?

11:32.420 --> 11:35.116
Tascioni-- what are
we gonna do about her?

11:35.160 --> 11:36.218
She's killing us.

11:38.060 --> 11:39.425
What?

11:45.230 --> 11:47.369
Alicia...
why aren't you

11:47.400 --> 11:50.301
answering your e-mails?
Eli, I'm working.
Can we do this another time?

11:50.340 --> 11:53.036
"Thank you very much, Peter,
for that warm introduction.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.229
"I hope you don't
think I'll go easy

11:54.280 --> 11:56.134
on your administration now."

11:56.180 --> 11:59.047
It was a joke, Eli.
That's all.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.071
"I'd also like
to thank ASA Polmar

12:01.120 --> 12:03.145
for saying such nice words."

12:03.190 --> 12:05.112
Yes.

12:05.150 --> 12:07.015
What?
He's introducing you?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.051
Finn is?
Yes.

12:09.090 --> 12:11.979
No, he isn't.
Yes, he said he would.

12:12.030 --> 12:12.997
Well, of course
he said he would.

12:13.030 --> 12:14.099
It puts him on the world stage.

12:14.130 --> 12:16.098
Eli, obviously
this matters to you

12:16.130 --> 12:18.291
because you're here,
but for the life of me,

12:18.330 --> 12:20.491
I can't figure out
what your problem is.
You have the governor

12:20.540 --> 12:23.134
of the great state of
Illinois introducing you.

12:23.170 --> 12:25.161
Then you have an ASA
from a tiny division

12:25.210 --> 12:26.507
of the state's attorney's
office introducing you, too?

12:26.540 --> 12:29.270
He's a hero, Eli.
He was shot in the line of duty.

12:29.310 --> 12:32.006
And he works under
my opponent Castro.

12:32.050 --> 12:34.041
Elfman thinks it looks good
that he endorsed me.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.116
Then tell Fin_n he can endorse
you at an inner-City event

12:36.150 --> 12:38.186
with 20 people at some
stinlq high school gym,

12:38.220 --> 12:39.448
not in front of
the national press.

12:39.490 --> 12:41.287
What national press?
This is an event,

12:41.320 --> 12:44.187
Alicia... uh, uh, maybe you're
not reading your own press.

12:44.230 --> 12:46.425
People like this story.
They're paying attention.

12:46.460 --> 12:49.327
You're the new power couple
from Obama's home state.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.123
It's broken through
to the MSM.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.263
Oh, don't say "MSM," please.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.461
Tell Finn he has been
disinvited.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.502
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
You're running for office.

12:57.540 --> 12:59.360
You can do whatever you like.
Why are all the computers

12:59.410 --> 13:01.105
here counting down? I feel like
I'm in a Bruckheimer movie.

13:01.140 --> 13:02.437
Wait, if I don't disinvite

13:02.480 --> 13:05.199
Finn... Peter won't come?
Peter has the

13:05.250 --> 13:06.069
governor's conference.

13:06.110 --> 13:07.509
He has
allotted time to endorse you.

13:07.550 --> 13:09.211
He wants to endorse you,
he does not

13:09.250 --> 13:11.184
want to share the stage
with an ASA.

13:11.220 --> 13:14.087
So he won't come? Seriously?

13:14.120 --> 13:15.519
Tell Finn he can

13:15.560 --> 13:18.085
endorse you at a later event.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.222
You need Peter.

13:19.260 --> 13:21.251
You do not need Finn.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.198
Hi.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.105
Thanks for seeing me.

13:34.140 --> 13:35.209
No problem.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.401
So, you're moving up
in the world.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.179
What do you want, Kalinda?

13:39.210 --> 13:41.144
Oh, just to say hello.

13:41.180 --> 13:43.284
No. What do you want?

13:43.320 --> 13:45.845
My firm has been hit
by ransomware.

13:45.890 --> 13:47.619
It's called Trojanlock.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.083
We paid the ransom, but they
didn't send the decryption key.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.155
Hmm. Tough break.
The account number
I wired it to--

13:52.190 --> 13:53.396
can you trace it?

13:53.430 --> 13:54.988
With a warrant.

13:55.030 --> 13:57.464
I only have 45 hours.
Oh, that's too bad.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.388
It'll take 48 hours
to get a warrant.

13:59.430 --> 14:02.035
Okay. Thanks.

14:03.940 --> 14:07.876
I don't like that I only see you
when you need something.

14:11.380 --> 14:12.642
Look, I don't
like it either.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.410
Then... stop it.

14:16.950 --> 14:18.349
How have you been?

14:18.390 --> 14:19.948
(wry laugh)

14:19.990 --> 14:21.514
I'll call you.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.187
Am I being dismissed?

14:23.230 --> 14:25.448
You're being dismissed.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.894
(jaunty Muzak playing
over phone)

14:29.930 --> 14:33.297
(slow dripping)

14:46.980 --> 14:48.379
Hello, my name is Bruce.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.308
Thank you for holding.
May I help you?

14:50.350 --> 14:53.558
Uh, yes.
I made a $50,000 payment

14:53.590 --> 14:56.980
and I'm still awaiting an e-mail
with a decryption key.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.622
Let me check
on your order status.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.457
(dripping continues)

15:00.500 --> 15:02.297
Yes, here we are.

15:02.330 --> 15:04.025
As requested,
that decryption key

15:04.070 --> 15:06.459
was e-mailed to "dlockhart
@lockhartandgardner.com."

15:06.500 --> 15:08.036
Oh, no, it...

15:08.070 --> 15:10.004
Oh.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.201
I think when
I filled out the form,

15:12.240 --> 15:13.969
it auto-filled
with my old e-mail address.

15:14.010 --> 15:15.671
I need the key sent
to my new address.

15:15.710 --> 15:17.678
I'm so sorry,

15:17.710 --> 15:20.440
I'm afraid we're only permitted
to send the decryption key

15:22.720 --> 15:24.608
You're kidding. You're-You're
ransoming my business

15:24.650 --> 15:26.311
and this is where
you draw the line?

15:26.350 --> 15:27.715
Will there be
anything else, ma'am?

15:27.760 --> 15:30.649
Uh, yes. I would like to
speak to the supervisor.

15:30.690 --> 15:32.624
It went to Lockhart/Gardner.

15:32.660 --> 15:34.491
Oh, dear God, this
is like a nightmare.

15:34.530 --> 15:36.225
We need to call them.

15:36.260 --> 15:38.524
Are you serious?
(stammers)

15:40.270 --> 15:42.261
(phone rings)

15:43.370 --> 15:44.530
David Lee.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.162
(softly clears throat)

15:46.210 --> 15:48.576
Hello, David.
It's Diane.

15:48.610 --> 15:51.078
Ah, Diane.
Forget something on the way out,

15:51.110 --> 15:52.407
like the silverware?

15:52.450 --> 15:55.169
David, I, um...

15:55.220 --> 15:57.211
I'm awaiting an important e-mail

15:57.250 --> 16:00.356
that was inadvertently
sent to my L.G.

16:00.390 --> 16:03.553
e-mail address, and I need you
to do me the courtesy

16:03.590 --> 16:05.581
of forwarding it.
Certainly,

16:05.630 --> 16:07.996
just as soon as monkeys
fly out of my butt.

16:09.030 --> 16:11.260
Well, that was fairly crass.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.734
I've been holding it back
all these years.

16:13.770 --> 16:15.567
Nice talking to you, Diane.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.737
Uh, D-David, wait.

16:16.770 --> 16:18.761
What do you want?

16:18.810 --> 16:20.778
What do I want?

16:20.810 --> 16:22.437
Two clients.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.402
No.
Tell you what,

16:24.450 --> 16:26.748
why don't you come over
and prostrate yourself

16:26.780 --> 16:29.340
and maybe we'll work
something out.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.255
Can we at least get
a bucket in here?

16:35.290 --> 16:36.518
Dana Lee

16:36.560 --> 16:38.528
Boykin. I was
a flight attendant

16:38.560 --> 16:40.221
on Azo Charter.
And this

16:40.260 --> 16:42.694
is a private jet line
that serves Mr. Napier?

16:42.730 --> 16:44.459
_ Yes.
Did you ever overhear
a conversation

16:44.500 --> 16:46.525
between Mr. Napier
and the plaintiff?

16:46.570 --> 16:48.299
RAYNA:
Objection, Your Honor; hearsay.
This isn't

16:48.340 --> 16:50.137
being offered for the
truth of the matter.

16:50.170 --> 16:51.432
This goes to impeachment.
That is

16:51.470 --> 16:53.631
true. I will allow.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.477
Yes, I did hear a phone call.
And what did Mr. Napier

16:55.510 --> 16:57.649
say at the end
of this phone call?

16:57.680 --> 16:59.602
He said, "I get enough
of this at home.

16:59.650 --> 17:01.470
The bitch
is driving me crazy."

17:01.520 --> 17:03.408
And one week later,
Camilla Vargas

17:03.450 --> 17:05.281
was fired.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.151
No further questions,
Your Honor.

17:07.190 --> 17:08.680
I got this.
N... Let's call a recess.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.119
It's okay.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.526
Ms. Boykin, do you

17:12.560 --> 17:14.528
still work for...

17:14.560 --> 17:16.448
Azo Charter?

17:16.500 --> 17:17.797
No, I don't.

17:17.830 --> 17:19.627
So, you were...

17:19.670 --> 17:23.106
BOYKIN:
I was...?

17:24.670 --> 17:27.400
You...

17:27.440 --> 17:29.431
(tuba notes playing)

17:29.480 --> 17:31.300
BROCHARD:
Do you have

17:31.350 --> 17:32.305
a question,
Ms. Tascioni?

17:32.350 --> 17:35.342
Do I? Yes, I do.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.179
BROCHARD:
Do you want to ask it?

17:42.360 --> 17:45.124
(mumbling)

17:45.160 --> 17:46.752
I don't even like penguins.

17:46.790 --> 17:49.793
BROCHARD:
Excuse me?

17:49.830 --> 17:51.491
ELSBETH:
Pengums.

17:51.530 --> 17:53.259
They have nothing
to do with this.

17:53.300 --> 17:56.599
Your Honor, we request a recess.

17:59.770 --> 18:01.328
Let's talk.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.803
Settlement? As long
as it's seven figures.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.501
I'll call you.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.248
Mr. Elfman.

18:13.290 --> 18:14.655
Mrs. Florrick.

18:14.690 --> 18:16.555
Eli talked to you?
He did.

18:16.590 --> 18:18.649
You think I should ask Finn
not to introduce me?

18:18.690 --> 18:21.193
I think if it means losing the
governor's introduction, yes.

18:21.230 --> 18:23.198
Finn_ went out
on a limb for me.

18:23.230 --> 18:25.494
I agree. So ask him
to endorse you later.

18:25.530 --> 18:26.861
I don't like it.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.868
Well, I don't
like asking you.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.765
But, unfortunately,
this is the beginning

18:30.810 --> 18:32.562
of a long line of
distasteful acts.

18:32.610 --> 18:35.238
Every single one of them
a step towards maturity.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.805
Maturity of what?
Of being a good
state's attorney.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.686
Hi.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.449
Hi.

18:45.490 --> 18:46.843
Do you always just wait here?

18:46.890 --> 18:48.858
I just saw
your car pull up.

18:48.890 --> 18:51.552
What's up?
How many hours
do you have left?

18:51.590 --> 18:52.887
Forty-three.

18:52.930 --> 18:55.524
The IP address to the computer

18:55.560 --> 18:57.289
your money was sent to.

18:57.330 --> 18:58.627
A Mr. Kellner.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.332
Thanks.

19:01.370 --> 19:03.463
(quietly):
Yeah.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.307
The next_ time
you come Vi5it me...

19:05.340 --> 19:08.173
come visit me, okay?

19:11.610 --> 19:13.214
VVhen?

19:31.930 --> 19:33.591
You want to talk
or you want me to?

19:33.640 --> 19:36.200
You. Use me if it gets violent.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.631
(sighs)

19:43.310 --> 19:46.473
Mr. Kellner, open the door.
It's a federal agent.

19:47.980 --> 19:50.483
What did I do?
I didn't do anything.

19:51.850 --> 19:53.454
KELLNER:
I got an e-mail.

19:53.490 --> 19:55.811
They said I can
earn money at home.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.589
Who said this?

19:57.630 --> 20:00.622
It was Mr. Black at this
cosmetics firm.

20:00.660 --> 20:03.458
They wire money
into my account.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.821
I get ten percent.
$1,500 a week.

20:05.870 --> 20:09.362
Then the rest of the money
goes into another account.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.607
You wire it into
another account?

20:11.640 --> 20:13.904
I don't do anything.
It's all automated.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.669
They're using you
as a money mule.

20:15.710 --> 20:18.907
_A what?
A middleman for _
a ransomware operation.

20:18.950 --> 20:21.271
You're laundering money, sir.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.788
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna

20:23.820 --> 20:24.980
have to take your computer.

20:25.020 --> 20:26.487
All right, go ahead.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.659
Take it. Take everything,

20:28.690 --> 20:30.248
(computer dings)
I don't care.

20:49.510 --> 20:51.501
(indistinct conversations,
phones ringing)

21:27.820 --> 21:29.344
Diane.

21:29.380 --> 21:32.315
Sorry if I don't get up.
Sciatica.

21:32.350 --> 21:34.853
I made a few changes
to the decor.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.629
Your chair squeaked
horribly, by the way.

21:38.660 --> 21:41.049
I'm surprised you didn't
knock down a wall or two.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.024
Oh, I still might.
We're having quite a quarter.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.791
About this e-mail...

21:49.670 --> 21:51.535
You opened it?

21:51.570 --> 21:53.800
No, but it is the property
of Lockhart/Gardner,

21:53.840 --> 21:56.479
so it wouldn't be strange
for me to open it and read it.

21:56.510 --> 21:58.774
It's nothing, David.

21:58.810 --> 22:01.370
It matters to me, not
to Lockhart/Gardner.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.615
Really? Then I have a proposal.

22:03.650 --> 22:04.844
Of course you do.

22:04.890 --> 22:07.552
It's to your benefit,
too. The lease.

22:07.590 --> 22:09.717
What lease? This lease?

22:09.760 --> 22:11.978
Yes, to these offices--
the 27th, 28th floor.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.851
It's still under your name,
yours and Will's, but...

22:14.900 --> 22:17.892
on his passing,
it reverted to you.

22:17.930 --> 22:21.366
And as you can see, you
no longer work here, so...

22:21.400 --> 22:25.063
we ask that you pass the lease
to Mr. Canning and myself.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.135
Really?

22:27.170 --> 22:30.742
(chuckling)

22:30.780 --> 22:32.372
I don't see what's so funny.

22:32.410 --> 22:35.072
It makes no sense for you
to act as sub-lessor.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.918
Makes no sense for you
to hold on to my e-mail,

22:37.950 --> 22:39.110
but here we are.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.618
(chuckles):
Exactly.

22:41.660 --> 22:44.686
So let's trade-- give us
the lease and here you go.

22:47.130 --> 22:48.654
No.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.089
Diane...

22:51.130 --> 22:53.121
I'll rip it up.

22:53.170 --> 22:56.594
Do it. But you'll never
get the lease.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.107
I might even kick you out.

22:58.140 --> 23:00.779
Don't call my bluff.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.545
Go ahead, David--
it's a copy

23:05.580 --> 23:07.172
of an e-mail.

23:07.210 --> 23:09.417
The paper
doesn't matter.

23:12.450 --> 23:14.054
Give me the e-mail,

23:14.090 --> 23:17.423
and I will discuss a
transfer of the lease.

23:18.460 --> 23:20.553
That is my best offer.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.022
CARY:
B-

23:22.060 --> 23:25.188
4-6-J-Q-

23:25.230 --> 23:27.027
7-9.

23:27.070 --> 23:29.061
David Lee really
gave you back your e-mail?

23:29.100 --> 23:30.761
I was surprised, too.

23:30.810 --> 23:31.606
Here goes.

23:32.570 --> 23:33.901
CAREY:
It's not working.

23:33.940 --> 23:35.430
Hit enter again.

23:36.540 --> 23:39.839
You have a better idea?

23:39.880 --> 23:42.212
Nothing's happening.
Something is--
look at the time code.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.445
CAREY: You're kidding-- it's
counting down twice as fast.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.446
DIANE:
Imagine that.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.855
It's not working, Kalinda.

23:49.890 --> 23:50.857
Well, what happened?

23:50.890 --> 23:52.050
We tried the decryption key,

23:52.090 --> 23:53.523
now the _time code
is counting down

23:53.560 --> 23:55.050
twice as fast.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.954
I'm getting on
with the helpline.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.126
No. They'll ask for more money.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.899
You have a lead?

23:59.930 --> 24:01.534
Our money was sent
through a money mule

24:01.570 --> 24:02.662
to somewhere in Russia.

24:02.700 --> 24:03.667
How do you know?

24:03.710 --> 24:04.961
I have a friend who contacted

24:05.010 --> 24:06.136
the Russian service provider.

24:06.170 --> 24:09.037
A friend?
Shh.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.002
(whispers):
Thanks a lot.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.677
How did he do that, your friend?

24:12.710 --> 24:15.019
It's a federal agent.

24:15.050 --> 24:17.177
Trojanlock is working
through a prom,

24:17.220 --> 24:19.609
but we have the money
mule's hard drive,

24:19.650 --> 24:21.618
so we're coordinating
access times.

24:21.660 --> 24:22.957
Good.

24:22.990 --> 24:24.184
Great.

24:24.230 --> 24:26.528
Where are you, Kalinda?

24:27.560 --> 24:28.629
Uh, home.

24:28.660 --> 24:30.628
You want me to come over?

24:30.670 --> 24:32.160
Uh, maybe later.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.191
I'm... working for a while.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.532
Sure. Sounds good.

24:40.170 --> 24:42.479
(groans)

24:44.010 --> 24:46.501
I told my mom I was gay.

24:48.250 --> 24:51.515
It was... hard.

24:51.550 --> 24:54.758
She doesn't like
all that stuff.

24:54.790 --> 24:58.624
She thinks I'll
end up on a float
with a transvestite nun.

25:00.260 --> 25:04.526
And then, you know,
a month later, she dies.

25:06.030 --> 25:10.034
She lived just long enough
to be disappointed in me.

25:14.780 --> 25:16.771
Do you have the, um...

25:16.810 --> 25:19.802
access times in Russia?

25:21.780 --> 25:25.284
Are you listening to anything
that I am saying at all?

25:25.320 --> 25:27.117
Yes.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.651
Mm.

25:30.660 --> 25:32.287
Um...

25:34.730 --> 25:38.166
Did you tell your parents
that you're gay?

25:42.840 --> 25:45.308
Lana".
VVhat?

25:46.670 --> 25:48.638
I can't do this.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.568
Do what?

25:50.610 --> 25:51.702
Talk?

25:51.750 --> 25:53.172
No.

25:53.210 --> 25:55.144
Talk about this.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.278
Sure.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.254
(exhales)

26:12.630 --> 26:14.359
ALICIA:
$5 million,

26:14.400 --> 26:17.233
and her options are backdated
to the date of her hire.

26:17.270 --> 26:19.261
RAYNA:
To the date of her firing,
and we can't go higher

26:19.310 --> 26:20.800
than $3 million.
DEAN: _
Rayna, we've proven seXIsm.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.239
ALICIA:
Understanding that

26:22.280 --> 26:23.747
after tomorrow,
our settlement demands

26:23.780 --> 26:25.372
are increased by...
DEAN: $3 million.

26:25.410 --> 26:27.139
RAYNA: I can go to four,
and I'll split

26:27.180 --> 26:28.374
the calendar difference
on the options.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.614
Best I can do.

26:29.650 --> 26:30.639
No.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.116
We don't want to settle.

26:33.150 --> 26:36.358
Look, if we take
another hit at trial,

26:36.390 --> 26:38.381
the settlement value's
only gonna increase.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.853
We won't take
another hit.

26:42.860 --> 26:45.294
I won't be
distracted again.

26:46.830 --> 26:49.390
We'll see you in court.

26:49.440 --> 26:52.659
How long did you negotiate this?

26:52.710 --> 26:56.635
(xylophone music playing)

26:56.680 --> 26:58.671
No.

26:58.710 --> 27:02.419
How long did you negotiate
with J-Serve

27:02.450 --> 27:04.714
this... this...

27:04.750 --> 27:07.685
*

27:07.720 --> 27:11.326
* Here I am,
a clown in your mind. *

27:11.360 --> 27:12.759
Stop it.

27:15.030 --> 27:16.998
This joint venture,

27:17.030 --> 27:19.362
how long were you
in negotiations?

27:20.330 --> 27:21.831
Good.

27:21.870 --> 27:23.861
Stay there.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.834
Context. Your Honor,
I am supplying context

27:26.870 --> 27:27.973
for the sexism.

27:29.340 --> 27:30.978
(exhales)

27:32.380 --> 27:34.018
(music stops)

27:34.050 --> 27:35.017
Ready.

27:35.050 --> 27:36.176
Mr. Shin...

27:36.220 --> 27:38.780
how long did Wong-Tei Gaming

27:38.820 --> 27:40.219
negotiate its joint venture

27:40.250 --> 27:41.751
with J-Serve?
Six months.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.929
But the deal did not close.
Really? Why not?

27:43.960 --> 27:46.929
SHIN:
We ended our interest after
discussions with Ms. Vargas

27:46.960 --> 27:48.325
in Beijing.
I see.

27:48.360 --> 27:51.261
And why did you...

27:56.770 --> 27:59.898
Let me try that again.

27:59.940 --> 28:01.430
Why did you end
your interest

28:01.480 --> 28:03.368
in a joint venture
after meeting with Camilla?

28:03.410 --> 28:06.379
She was very loud--
interrupted our
chairman often,

28:06.410 --> 28:09.208
refused to pour tea,
and she drank too much.
So during your negotiations

28:09.250 --> 28:11.718
with her, she
basically acted like a man?
Objection,

28:11.750 --> 28:13.388
Your Honor--
relevance.

28:13.420 --> 28:14.887
Context, Your Honor.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.353
J-Serve worked

28:16.390 --> 28:17.482
with sexist companies
in China.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.488
That doesn't mean they're sexist

28:19.530 --> 28:21.350
for requiring Ms. Vargas
to work with them.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.719
Oh, come on!
Your Honor,

28:22.760 --> 28:24.318
is the defense
really saying,

28:24.370 --> 28:26.361
"Hey, we're sexist,
but the Chinese made us do it"?

28:26.400 --> 28:27.469
No. We're saying

28:27.500 --> 28:29.058
our client made a decision

28:29.100 --> 28:31.466
based on the sexism
of an outSIde busmess partner.

28:31.510 --> 28:34.001
That's all.
Hm. Novel.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.473
I will allow.

28:37.510 --> 28:39.205
Hey, next state's attorney.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.741
Hi. The office said
you'd be here.

28:41.780 --> 28:44.089
Oh, so you're
here to see me?

28:44.120 --> 28:46.042
Well, this is the ASA bar,

28:46.090 --> 28:48.388
and they, uh, they don't like
defense attorneys here.

28:48.420 --> 28:50.388
Shot of tequila, please.

28:50.420 --> 28:52.320
Good. You're not
driving today.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.396
Why would you say that?
Well, last time

28:54.430 --> 28:56.193
you didn't want
to have a drink.

28:56.230 --> 28:58.061
Oh. Right.

29:03.370 --> 29:04.462
So...

29:04.510 --> 29:06.398
I have given it
a lot of thought,

29:06.440 --> 29:08.408
and I can't ask you
to endorse me.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.806
Alicia, I already decided.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.546
No. It hurts you with Castro.

29:13.580 --> 29:15.775
And I'm fine with that.

29:15.820 --> 29:18.015
No. Maybe I'll ask you later,

29:18.050 --> 29:21.850
but I am cancelling you
for Monday.

29:21.890 --> 29:24.029
What's going on, Alicia?

29:24.060 --> 29:25.925
Ijust...

29:25.960 --> 29:27.791
I'm asking too much of you.

29:27.830 --> 29:29.127
No, you're not.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.924
Do you not want me
to endorse you?

29:31.970 --> 29:33.790
No, I do.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.138
But...?

29:36.170 --> 29:38.809
What, you're worried
about the photo of us?

29:38.840 --> 29:40.137
No, that's easily explained.

29:40.170 --> 29:42.502
You were at my apartment
doing witness prep.

29:42.540 --> 29:45.304
Right. Then, uh...

29:45.350 --> 29:46.999
your husband?

29:48.050 --> 29:49.574
No.

29:49.620 --> 29:51.941
Okay, well, then
here's the thing.

29:51.990 --> 29:56.279
I am endorsing you
because I'm inherently selfish,

29:56.320 --> 30:01.121
and I think that you'll make
a great state's attorney.

30:01.160 --> 30:04.129
So don't think
that I'm sacrificing anything.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.491
I want to
endorse you.

30:11.870 --> 30:13.132
Okay.

30:13.170 --> 30:14.171
Are you sure?

30:14.210 --> 30:16.201
I am now.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.145
ELSBETH: Mr. Fong, could you
please explain your management
consultant practice?

30:24.190 --> 30:27.387
Yes. I advise American companies
on the cultural intricacies

30:29.960 --> 30:34.499
And did you advise J-Serve
after its failed negotiations

30:34.530 --> 30:36.259
with Wong-Tei Gaming?

30:36.300 --> 30:39.519
Yes, I advised them that China
is a patriarchal society,

30:39.570 --> 30:42.937
and having a brash, "bitchy"

30:42.970 --> 30:43.937
female CEO was
problematic.

30:43.970 --> 30:45.437
So in your opinion,

30:45.470 --> 30:48.109
the decision
to terminate Ms. Vargas,

30:48.140 --> 30:50.904
though facially sexist,
could be justified

30:50.950 --> 30:52.349
as a business necessity.

30:52.380 --> 30:55.417
Your Honor, plaintiff asks
for a directed verdict.

30:55.450 --> 30:58.089
On what ground?
Ms. Tascioni has
expressly conceded

30:58.120 --> 31:00.213
the issue at bar:
seXIsm.

31:00.250 --> 31:02.059
BROCHARD:
Ms. Tascioni?
Huh?

31:02.090 --> 31:03.978
Anything?

31:04.030 --> 31:06.328
BROCHARD: Have you conceded it?
No.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.954
Uh, she's explained it,
Your Honor.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.093
This case is not_
about J-Serve's seXIsm,

31:11.130 --> 31:13.064
it's about China's sexism.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.328
Mr. Perotti's motion...

31:14.370 --> 31:15.337
I mean

31:15.370 --> 31:17.065
Mrs. Florrick's motion--

31:17.100 --> 31:18.499
(chuckles):
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

31:18.540 --> 31:21.031
I am visualizing
stillness over here.

31:24.080 --> 31:25.502
(gasps)

31:29.080 --> 31:31.344
What are you doing here,
Mr. Perotti?

31:31.390 --> 31:33.039
Josh.

31:33.090 --> 31:35.217
God, watching you work.

31:35.260 --> 31:36.989
I'm tingling.
No.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.079
Don't tingle.
No tingling.

31:39.130 --> 31:40.222
You're here
to rattle me,

31:40.260 --> 31:41.397
aren't you?
No, no.

31:41.430 --> 31:43.091
I'm here on
business. But...

31:43.130 --> 31:44.358
am I rattling you?

31:44.400 --> 31:46.288
No. I'm just saying...

31:46.330 --> 31:47.991
What business?

31:48.040 --> 31:49.530
Have dinner with me tonight,
and I'll tell you.

31:49.570 --> 31:51.367
No. Stop it.
Why not?

31:51.410 --> 31:53.059
I don't like
that you're corrupt.

31:53.110 --> 31:55.078
I'm an AUSA.

31:55.110 --> 31:58.079
I have the full faith
of the United States
government behind me.

31:58.110 --> 31:59.646
And I think...

31:59.680 --> 32:02.376
you are so sew
with your red hair.

32:15.130 --> 32:16.654
CAREY:
Not too much time to spare.

32:16.700 --> 32:18.167
KALINDA: _
How do you know Ru55ian?

32:18.200 --> 32:19.963
Uh, my mom-- she
forced us to learn

32:20.000 --> 32:21.467
to play the piano
oralanguage.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.229
And you chose Russian?
Yeah, I know.

32:23.270 --> 32:25.135
I thought it
sounded cool.

32:25.170 --> 32:27.309
KALINDA: Okay, so I'm gonna be
RATting this computer,

32:27.340 --> 32:29.171
so this may get angry.
"RATting"?

32:29.210 --> 32:32.270
Yeah. Remotely Administering
his webcam. Ready?

32:36.280 --> 32:38.214
Hey,you!

32:39.690 --> 32:42.250
KALINDA:
Yeah, you! Schmuck!

32:42.290 --> 32:43.450
(speaking Russian)

32:43.490 --> 32:45.185
...schmuck!

32:46.360 --> 32:47.657
(speaks Russian)

32:47.690 --> 32:49.248
(translating):
Uh, how are you...

32:49.300 --> 32:50.995
(speaks Russian)
What are you doing?

32:51.030 --> 32:54.193
I'm Kalinda, and you,
Boris Ivankov,

32:54.240 --> 32:55.491
are a cyber-terrorist.

32:55.540 --> 32:58.202
(translating,
speaking Russian)

32:59.670 --> 33:01.331
Nyet.
No.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.177
(speaks Russian)
I'm an entrepreneur.

33:03.210 --> 33:04.245
But you're not

33:04.280 --> 33:05.406
a very good entrepreneur,

33:05.450 --> 33:07.179
because I just RATted
your computer.

33:07.210 --> 33:08.518
(translating)

33:08.550 --> 33:10.040
(speaking Russian)

33:10.080 --> 33:11.513
How very exciting
for you.

33:11.550 --> 33:13.347
You held our files for ransom.

33:13.390 --> 33:15.085
We paid you,

33:15.120 --> 33:17.213
and you're still
threatening to erase them.

33:17.260 --> 33:19.057
(speaking Russian)

33:19.090 --> 33:20.626
Now, return our money...
(speaking Russian)

33:20.660 --> 33:22.389
and unlock our
computers immediately,

33:22.430 --> 33:24.261
or I'm gonna delete
your hard drive.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.427
(Carey speaking Russian)

33:26.470 --> 33:27.767
Hmm.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.438
(speaking Russian)

33:29.470 --> 33:31.529
"I decline."

33:31.570 --> 33:34.073
Perhaps you didn't hear me.

33:34.110 --> 33:35.407
(speaking Russian)

33:35.440 --> 33:37.408
CAREY:
Destroy my network.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.169
I will just go on
to another one.

33:39.210 --> 33:41.542
I'll go to the politsiya.

33:41.580 --> 33:43.070
They will not care.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.712
(taps computer key)

33:44.750 --> 33:47.583
(woman speaking Russian,
music playing)

33:47.620 --> 33:50.384
Uh... what are you doing?

33:50.420 --> 33:52.559
Oh, you speak English.

33:52.590 --> 33:54.296
It's Pussy Riot.

33:54.330 --> 33:55.729
I know what is this.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.250
This is not mine.

33:57.300 --> 34:00.098
What about this?

34:00.130 --> 34:02.769
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no. This is wrong.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.631
_It_'s true.
The polit5iya doesn't care

34:04.670 --> 34:07.366
about our little Chicago
law firm, but they do

34:07.410 --> 34:09.332
care about anti-Putin
propaganda.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.678
(shouting in Russian)

34:18.890 --> 34:21.085
Ooh! Yeah!
We're live.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.486
We got it.
We got it.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.829
We're back on line.

34:25.860 --> 34:29.227
Do svidaniya, Boris.

34:29.260 --> 34:31.820
(speaking Russian)
(gavel banging)

34:31.870 --> 34:34.839
So, this is a question
of first impression.

34:34.870 --> 34:37.532
Is cultural relativism
a bar to a claim

34:37.570 --> 34:40.767
of sexual discrimination, or is
it tantamount to an admission

34:40.810 --> 34:43.335
that should end these...

34:43.380 --> 34:44.847
(sighing)
...proceedings?

34:44.880 --> 34:46.279
(clears throat)
Miss Tascioni,

34:46.310 --> 34:48.346
is there a problem?

34:48.380 --> 34:50.245
What? No, Judge.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.339
I... I'm being stalked.
Excuse me?

34:52.390 --> 34:53.618
That man in the gallery
over there,

34:53.650 --> 34:56.517
Josh Perotti-- he's a stalker.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.858
Sir, if you don't have any
business in my courtroom...

34:58.890 --> 35:01.154
Actually, Your Honor,
(clears throat) I do.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.795
I am AUSA Perotti, and I have

35:04.830 --> 35:07.367
a federal warrant here
to stop these proceedings.

35:07.400 --> 35:09.163
For what cause?

35:09.200 --> 35:11.464
Pending the disposition
of federal criminal charges

35:11.510 --> 35:14.138
against J-Serve for theft
of trade secrets.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.205
The company's assets
have been frozen.

35:16.240 --> 35:19.141
Theft of trade secrets?
You're charging the company

35:19.180 --> 35:21.171
with a felony.
J-Serve has stolen
millions of dollars

35:21.220 --> 35:23.211
of intellectual property, Judge.

35:23.250 --> 35:27.619
The civil suit can't proceed
until the criminal case

35:27.650 --> 35:29.186
has been resolved.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.619
Peter's introductory remarks

35:30.660 --> 35:31.888
will last approximately
five minutes,

35:31.930 --> 35:33.522
and he won't stay on stage
during Alicia's speech.

35:33.560 --> 35:34.527
He won't?
No.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.699
Where will he stay?

35:36.730 --> 35:38.368
Just over there, in the wings,
waiting for her to finish.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.197
You're afraid of repeating
the scandal photo.

35:40.230 --> 35:42.232
We don't want Peter to be _seen
in a weaker spousal p05ition.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.738
Mr. Governor, we won't garner
the press coverage

35:44.770 --> 35:46.761
we want without you
staying on stage, sir.

35:46.810 --> 35:48.573
I don't think you have to worry.

35:48.610 --> 35:50.202
There'll be enough attention.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.640
Is this about
the Sun-Tim polling?

35:52.680 --> 35:55.240
It's about us wanting
the governor to appear strong.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.611
JOHNNY:
No one is taking that
poll seriously, sir.

35:56.650 --> 35:57.878
Alicia's not in
competition With you.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.410
Her favorables are only higher

35:59.450 --> 36:00.883
because she hasn't
started running.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.218
Sorry. Court ran long.
Oh, no, perfect timing.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.285
Listen, were were coordinating
for the endorsement.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.924
You don't mind if I introduce
you and then watch the rest

36:07.960 --> 36:09.825
of your speech
from the wings, do you?

36:09.860 --> 36:13.193
No. If you don't mind
if Finn introduces me, too.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.638
I-I'm just
gonna".

36:16.670 --> 36:18.535
We should, uh...
Yeah.

36:22.940 --> 36:25.477
How much is the governor
really gonna help, Eli?

36:25.510 --> 36:27.944
I don't know.
Let's see.

36:30.550 --> 36:32.381
Why are you insisting
on this?

36:32.420 --> 36:34.718
I'm not insisting
on anything.

36:34.760 --> 36:35.954
I asked Finn to introduce me

36:35.990 --> 36:37.548
when we all thought
it was a good idea.

36:37.590 --> 36:39.285
He said "yes,"
despite his standing

36:39.330 --> 36:41.525
in the state's
attorney's office.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.290
What standing in the state's
attorney's office?
So, I am not now

36:44.330 --> 36:46.594
going to tell him, "Sorry,
but it's inconvenient for me."

36:46.630 --> 36:49.235
Even if he's the only one
introducing you?

36:49.270 --> 36:52.239
Seriously, Peter? I stand
beside you at every damn event.

36:52.270 --> 36:54.932
You go off banging prostitutes
two at a time, and...

36:54.980 --> 36:56.675
All right,
you don't want to go there.

36:56.710 --> 36:58.268
...and I stood beside you
like a grinning fool!

36:58.310 --> 36:59.868
Would you let it go?

36:59.910 --> 37:01.878
For God's sakes, let it go!

37:01.920 --> 37:04.514
For your own good,

37:04.550 --> 37:05.949
even if you don't believe it.

37:05.990 --> 37:07.810
For the very fact
that I'm the governor,

37:07.850 --> 37:10.284
and you're asking me
for a favor-- let it go!

37:10.320 --> 37:12.959
Is that what I'm doing here?
I'm asking you for a-a favor?

37:12.990 --> 37:14.651
Yes, you are.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.793
You want something.
That's a favor.

37:16.830 --> 37:18.263
No.

37:18.300 --> 37:19.858
And you know why it's not?

37:19.900 --> 37:23.768
Because if you don't
show up to endorse me,

37:23.800 --> 37:26.803
if you go off to some
governor's conference instead,

37:26.840 --> 37:29.638
your favorables will plummet
through the floor.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.875
On the day that you want to
be talking about pensions,

37:31.910 --> 37:35.778
every question will be about
the state of your marriage.

37:35.820 --> 37:38.789
Yes, I may need
you, Peter,

37:38.820 --> 37:40.742
but you sure as hell
need me, too.

37:43.860 --> 37:46.784
I need you,
but I don't need Finn Polmar.

37:46.830 --> 37:48.991
Well, suck it up, Peter,
'cause he's part of the deal!

37:49.030 --> 37:50.725
Really?

37:50.760 --> 37:52.796
Who's the one sucking it up?

37:52.830 --> 37:54.331
(scoffs)

37:54.370 --> 37:55.792
Endorse me or not, Peter.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.990
I don't really care,
but I'm out of here.

38:05.910 --> 38:08.378
Do what you want.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.711
We need you to team up
to beat this federal case.

38:16.760 --> 38:22.357
Oh, God.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.526
You're serious?
Yes.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.790
The alleged theft of
trade secrets happened

38:25.830 --> 38:27.468
under your watch, ma'am.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.730
Your cooperation with
J-Serve defense is crucial.

38:29.770 --> 38:32.534
To you.
If our client goes
bankrupt on this case,

38:32.570 --> 38:33.662
you collect pennies
on the dollar.

38:33.710 --> 38:35.598
But if you help us
beat the Feds,

38:35.640 --> 38:37.335
we can pick up
where we left off.

38:37.380 --> 38:38.472
That's a lot of ifs.

38:38.510 --> 38:41.047
Yes, but what
choice do you have?

38:51.590 --> 38:52.579
(screaming)

38:53.860 --> 38:56.021
Oh, no. That's it. That's it!

38:56.060 --> 38:59.860
Everything all right?
No. Alicia, we can't stay here.
It's not working.

38:59.900 --> 39:02.994
Diane, we signed the lease.
Um, breach of contract,
lessor fraud.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.100
We'll find something,
but, I mean, look around.

39:06.140 --> 39:09.371
It's a... it's a roach-infested
wreck, Alicia!

39:09.410 --> 39:12.447
The infrastructure's rotten,
we're in a lousy neighborhood.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.619
Isn't that part
of the romance of a startup?

39:14.650 --> 39:16.618
No. Cockroaches
are not romantic.

39:16.650 --> 39:20.017
Where would we go, even if
we could get the lease annulled?

39:20.050 --> 39:22.655
What if I controlled
a prime space

39:22.690 --> 39:25.386
I could get my hands on
at a submarket rate?

39:25.430 --> 39:27.557
(chuckling):
Okay.

39:30.530 --> 39:32.589
Lockhart/Gardner?

39:32.630 --> 39:34.598
_ It's a lease
aSSIgnment agreement.

39:34.640 --> 39:38.406
I'm supposed to deed over
my interest to David Lee.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.032
But...

39:40.070 --> 39:41.606
I'm not going to.

39:46.750 --> 39:49.617
Someone's turned on.

39:49.650 --> 39:51.641
You're bad.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.419
How am I bad?

39:53.450 --> 39:54.678
J-Serve.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.688
What is that?

39:59.060 --> 40:01.620
You spend the night,
and then, the next day,

40:01.660 --> 40:05.460
the Feds sweep in with
an indictment for J-Serve.

40:07.700 --> 40:10.430
Are you suggesting
I got it from you?

40:10.470 --> 40:13.769
No. From the files on my desk.

40:16.110 --> 40:18.647
Wow. Uh...

40:20.710 --> 40:22.678
Just because
you would do it, Kalinda,

40:22.720 --> 40:24.585
doesn't mean that I would.

40:24.620 --> 40:27.783
No... but you did.

40:30.620 --> 40:32.759
Okay.

40:34.090 --> 40:36.650
I'll see you.

40:36.700 --> 40:39.669
Look, it's okay.
I'm... I'm fine.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.759
(door closes)

40:41.800 --> 40:43.995
POLMAR: Allow me to be
brutally honest with you.

40:44.040 --> 40:46.668
I was not looking for another
candidate to endorse,

40:46.710 --> 40:50.737
and I was not looking
to get into politics.

40:50.780 --> 40:54.671
But then, well, I met
Alicia Florrick.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.745
Do I say something
about Peter?

40:56.780 --> 40:58.042
About him not showing? No.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.547
I'll talk to them after.

40:59.590 --> 41:01.558
Spin it.

41:01.590 --> 41:03.251
You all right?

41:03.290 --> 41:05.520
I'm nervous.
Why are there so few people?

41:05.560 --> 41:07.721
That's a lot.
That's two national crews,

41:07.760 --> 41:09.625
three local, and
20 of my people.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.025
They'll clap loud.

41:11.060 --> 41:13.028
It'll feel bigger
once it's broadcast.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.765
All the viewers see
is the front row.

41:14.800 --> 41:17.268
Keep your eyes towards
the rear of the room.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.029
It'll make it seem
like there's thousands.

41:19.070 --> 41:21.504
Oh, God. My stomach.
I feel sick.

41:21.540 --> 41:23.633
Just like being in court.
Opening arguments.

41:23.680 --> 41:27.104
(applause)
Okay? Here we go.
He's wrapping it up.

41:27.150 --> 41:30.176
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next state's attorney

41:30.220 --> 41:32.643
for Cook County,
Alicia Florrick.

41:32.690 --> 41:34.851
(applause)

41:38.260 --> 41:40.182
(whispering):
Sorry I'm late.
How you doing?

41:40.230 --> 41:41.857
Good. This is a surprise.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.754
I'm just being
a supportive spouse.

41:43.800 --> 41:44.892
Thank you.
My pleasure.

41:44.930 --> 41:47.524
Thank you all.

41:47.570 --> 41:50.789
Forgive me for, uh,
stealing the limelight,

41:50.840 --> 41:53.001
for a second, from Alicia.

41:53.040 --> 41:56.669
I just needed to add to
Mr. Polmar's very fine remarks.

41:56.710 --> 41:59.679
Let me, uh,
just say that

41:59.710 --> 42:01.974
I have not met a more fair

42:02.020 --> 42:06.787
and honest person than
my wife, Alicia Florrick.

42:06.820 --> 42:10.881
There are _those_ who know
justice in their bones.

42:10.920 --> 42:13.081
(slowly fading):
They don't need to be
taught right and wrong.

42:13.130 --> 42:15.690
They live it every day.

42:15.730 --> 42:18.722
(voice fades out,
music fades in)

42:21.770 --> 42:22.998
Thank you.

42:24.870 --> 42:29.000
*

42:38.750 --> 42:42.049
