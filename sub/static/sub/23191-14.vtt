00:45.324 --> 00:47.325
Listen up, everyone.

00:47.359 --> 00:50.461
I'd like to introduce my
nephew, Charlie Brackenreid.

00:50.496 --> 00:53.697
He's just arrived from London
and has passed his training day

00:53.732 --> 00:56.167
with flying colours. Make him feel at home,

00:56.201 --> 00:59.103
- but don't go too easy on him.
- Always good

00:59.138 --> 01:01.039
to have another man on the
blue team. George Crabtree.

01:01.073 --> 01:03.841
- Pleased to meet you, Crabtree.
- Detective William Murdoch.

01:03.875 --> 01:05.843
Welcome to Station House Number Four.

01:05.877 --> 01:07.945
I hope our fair city won't disappoint.

01:07.979 --> 01:11.348
- Thank you. Happy to be here.
- Higgins.

01:11.382 --> 01:14.018
- Charlie, have that desk.
- But, sir...

01:14.052 --> 01:16.820
It's only a desk, Higgins. It
doesn't have your bloody name

01:16.855 --> 01:19.523
on it, does it? Go on, Charlie.

01:24.429 --> 01:26.996
Thank you, Constable. George, with me.

01:27.031 --> 01:29.099
A body's been found off Amelia St.

01:29.133 --> 01:32.035
- Sir.
- Murdoch. Take Charlie instead.

01:32.070 --> 01:35.238
It can be an informative first day for him.

01:35.273 --> 01:38.775
Of course, sir. Constable Brackenreid.

01:44.618 --> 01:48.020
Your uncle seems very
glad to have you aboard.

01:48.054 --> 01:50.756
I hope I can match his
standards, sir. He's a hell

01:50.790 --> 01:53.492
- of a copper, I'm told.
- I'm sure you'll do just fine.

01:56.295 --> 01:59.063
Your initial assessment of
the crime scene, Constable?

01:59.098 --> 02:01.233
It's not a nice part of town, but she seems

02:01.267 --> 02:04.169
- like a genteel sort of lady.
- I concur.

02:04.203 --> 02:07.805
She's in evening wear, so
I'd say she died at night.

02:07.840 --> 02:11.143
There's no bugs, so likely last night.

02:11.177 --> 02:13.645
With all that jewellery still on
her, she didn't die for her money.

02:13.679 --> 02:15.713
Excellent observations, Constable.

02:15.748 --> 02:17.715
Detective Murdoch.

02:17.750 --> 02:20.985
- This is Dr. Grace, our coroner.
- First day on the job,

02:21.020 --> 02:22.987
- Constable?
- Brackenreid.

02:23.022 --> 02:26.257
- Charlie Brackenreid.
- Yes, I can see the resemblance.

02:26.291 --> 02:28.526
If you would.

02:34.231 --> 02:36.167
Doctor?

02:36.201 --> 02:38.602
Detective... I know this woman.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.283
I simply can't imagine it.

02:43.384 --> 02:45.720
She was very much alive
at the party last night.

02:46.534 --> 02:50.270
Tell me about this party.
Everything you can remember.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.905
It was in a small space off Cherry Street.

02:52.939 --> 02:54.907
A mixed crowd.

02:54.941 --> 02:57.143
(lively music)

02:57.178 --> 03:00.880
<i>Lillian said she heard about the
gatherings through a friend of a friend.</i>

03:08.789 --> 03:12.692
This is going to be a fun night.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.061
Oh!

03:18.631 --> 03:22.801
- To friendship.
- To us.

03:22.835 --> 03:25.837
<i>Do you recall anything untoward?</i>

03:25.871 --> 03:29.874
<i>We mostly kept to ourselves all night.</i>

03:31.877 --> 03:34.079
I never thought a place like this existed.

03:34.113 --> 03:36.682
Stick with me and I'll show
and show all sorts of secrets.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.350
Let's dance.

03:38.384 --> 03:42.553
- Together?
- Why not? I'll lead.

03:42.588 --> 03:47.058
(laughing)

03:47.093 --> 03:49.427
I love this music.

04:00.138 --> 04:03.574
<i>- When did you first see the victim?
- She welcomed us.</i>

04:03.609 --> 04:07.378
<i>- We took her to be the hostess.
- Hello, ladies.</i>

04:07.412 --> 04:08.946
Welcome. Hello.

04:08.980 --> 04:10.581
I trust you're enjoying yourselves.

04:10.616 --> 04:13.617
- Indeed.
- Just be sure to keep this place to yourselves.

04:13.651 --> 04:17.019
We wouldn't want to begin attracting
the "right" sort of people.

04:19.757 --> 04:22.325
That's all I saw of her.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.327
Have you determined the cause of death?

04:24.362 --> 04:27.397
A single stab wound to
the heart. I found fibers

04:27.431 --> 04:30.967
matching the victim's clothing in the
wound, as well as traces of charcoal.

04:31.001 --> 04:33.069
The weapon was approximately

04:33.103 --> 04:35.405
half an inch wide and no
more than three inches long,

04:35.439 --> 04:38.441
- with a tapered point.
- Sounds like a stiletto blade.

04:38.476 --> 04:41.811
My conclusion as well. And there's these.

04:43.814 --> 04:45.782
Diagonal cuts.

04:45.816 --> 04:49.085
I believe she may have tried
to pull the knife out herself.

04:49.119 --> 04:51.353
- Anything else, Doctor?
- Yes.

04:51.388 --> 04:54.523
I examined the rings on her right hand.

04:54.557 --> 04:56.558
I found blood and tissue on each of them.

04:56.593 --> 04:59.095
- She tried to fight off her attacker.
- And left a nasty row

04:59.129 --> 05:02.998
of cuts behind. But I saw no one
with such a wound at the party.

05:03.032 --> 05:05.367
Where exactly was this?

05:12.041 --> 05:14.710
Do you think Dr. Grace
got the right address?

05:14.744 --> 05:17.313
In my experience, Dr.
Grace is seldom wrong.

05:17.347 --> 05:19.614
Hello?

05:19.648 --> 05:21.716
We're closed.

05:21.750 --> 05:24.853
- You'll be open when we say you're open.
- Thank you, Constable.

05:24.887 --> 05:28.089
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

05:28.124 --> 05:31.126
- Is this your establishment?
- Yes.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.629
Good. Do you know this woman?

05:34.663 --> 05:36.831
Miss Diana White.

05:36.865 --> 05:39.233
Rents the place out every now and again.

05:39.267 --> 05:41.268
I guess I won't be paid my eight dollars

05:41.303 --> 05:43.538
for last night then.

05:43.572 --> 05:46.240
Would you happen to
have an address for her?

05:46.274 --> 05:48.743
601A Jarvis Street.

05:48.777 --> 05:51.178
Address like that, you'd think
she'd be renting the ballroom

05:51.213 --> 05:53.714
at the Queen's Hotel.

05:57.819 --> 06:00.988
The housekeeper says
the "A" is around here.

06:01.022 --> 06:04.058
This must be it just ahead.

06:09.364 --> 06:12.366
Not exactly the dwelling
of a well-to-do woman.

06:16.904 --> 06:18.872
These dresses, sir.

06:18.906 --> 06:21.408
Each one more fancy than the last.

06:21.442 --> 06:23.744
A lot of very expensive jewellery.

06:23.778 --> 06:25.745
And this, sir.

06:25.779 --> 06:27.780
A Tiffany lamp.

06:27.814 --> 06:29.815
That's worth a bobble or two.

06:29.850 --> 06:32.818
Fine jewellery, silver,

06:32.853 --> 06:35.588
clothes,

06:35.622 --> 06:38.091
nothing in the larder

06:38.125 --> 06:41.360
but a bottle of champagne.

06:41.395 --> 06:43.729
She's no thief either, sir.

06:43.764 --> 06:47.433
Got receipts for the lot.

06:47.467 --> 06:50.969
Where did she get this kind of
money, living in a shack like this?

06:53.139 --> 06:56.108
Who was this Diana White?

06:56.142 --> 06:58.110
She sounds to me like a
young woman more interested

06:58.144 --> 07:00.045
in finery than survival.

07:00.079 --> 07:03.248
Why waste money on frivolous things

07:03.283 --> 07:05.250
like fancy dresses

07:05.285 --> 07:07.286
and jewellery when one
is starving and cold?

07:07.320 --> 07:10.389
She's a young woman who's
been given gifts and money,

07:10.423 --> 07:13.991
- perhaps the patronage of an older man.
- Patronage?

07:14.026 --> 07:18.062
For talents that many young women possess.

07:18.096 --> 07:20.932
This type of girl isn't thinking
about her future, William.

07:20.966 --> 07:23.535
She isn't interested
in marriage or security.

07:23.569 --> 07:26.938
She's had a taste of a life she
thought was forever beyond her grasp,

07:26.972 --> 07:29.307
and she'll do anything to keep it.

07:29.341 --> 07:31.475
Hm!

07:36.982 --> 07:40.284
- So that's her then.
- Yes.

07:40.319 --> 07:42.920
Her name is Diana White.

07:42.955 --> 07:46.023
Alive last night and then...

07:46.058 --> 07:48.759
our existence is truly fleeting.

07:48.793 --> 07:50.761
All the more reason

07:50.795 --> 07:52.796
to follow one's true
passions while you can.

07:52.831 --> 07:56.467
Emily,

07:56.501 --> 07:59.536
I picked up someone else's coat last night.

07:59.571 --> 08:02.172
And you won't believe what I found in it.

08:02.206 --> 08:05.008
I bought the coat at Eaton's,

08:05.042 --> 08:07.910
along with a hundred other girls.
And I can assure you, Detective,

08:07.945 --> 08:10.213
it didn't come with hidden pockets.

08:10.247 --> 08:12.215
Well, these are obviously well-cut stones

08:12.249 --> 08:15.785
in expensive settings.

08:15.819 --> 08:18.921
The most likely explanation
is the owner of this coat

08:18.956 --> 08:23.025
was attempting to secret away stolen goods.

08:23.059 --> 08:25.194
Where do you believe the mix-up occurred?

08:25.228 --> 08:27.363
I wore it to the party last night.

08:27.397 --> 08:29.899
I did notice a blond woman
wearing the same coat,

08:29.933 --> 08:31.901
but I paid it no mind.

08:31.935 --> 08:34.736
I imagine I took hers and she took mine.

08:34.770 --> 08:37.239
You didn't notice
anything amiss at the time?

08:37.273 --> 08:38.474
It was a warm night.

08:38.509 --> 08:42.410
- I didn't put it on until today.
- Perhaps the jewels belonged to Miss White.

08:42.445 --> 08:45.314
Then the blond woman could be her killer.

08:45.348 --> 08:48.517
Yet Miss White's body hadn't been robbed,

08:48.551 --> 08:50.552
so thievery likely wasn't the motive.

08:50.586 --> 08:54.222
I'll attempt to trace these
pieces back to their origin.

08:54.256 --> 08:57.291
Perhaps the jeweller who made them
will be able to shed some light

08:57.326 --> 09:00.829
on their unusual journey.

09:00.863 --> 09:03.999
Thank you, ladies.

09:04.033 --> 09:06.735
So what's that Dr. Grace do when
she's not hanging about dead bodies?

09:06.769 --> 09:09.203
Ah, so you noticed her then, did you?

09:09.238 --> 09:12.773
- It's hard not to.
- I know it's not been easy for you.

09:12.807 --> 09:15.876
But you're here now, doing
the Brackenreid name proud.

09:15.911 --> 09:18.446
- Thank you, Uncle Tommy.
- Inspector,

09:18.480 --> 09:22.050
when we're in the Station
House, alright? Oh. Half a mo...

09:22.084 --> 09:23.784
Dr. Grace.

09:23.818 --> 09:27.421
- What a happy coincidence.
- Inspector. What can I do for you?

09:27.455 --> 09:29.790
I was hoping that you could
come to dinner this evening.

09:29.824 --> 09:31.792
Oh, how kind, but...

09:31.826 --> 09:34.194
Charlie thinks very highly
of you, and he could use

09:34.228 --> 09:36.296
some friends his own age.

09:36.330 --> 09:38.966
- I'm afraid I have to work this evening.
- Tomorrow then.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.602
- Uh... Perhaps, but I...
- Perfect.

09:41.636 --> 09:43.203
Seven o'clock.

09:43.237 --> 09:46.406
- Sounds lovely.
- Good day, ladies.

09:46.441 --> 09:49.776
(laughing)

09:52.846 --> 09:55.815
- Miss White was an excellent customer.
- Can you confirm

09:55.849 --> 09:58.618
that Miss White purchased
these items from your store?

10:00.621 --> 10:02.589
Mr. Jamieson?

10:02.623 --> 10:05.458
These were stolen a few days ago.

10:05.492 --> 10:08.461
Oh. And you didn't report it?

10:08.495 --> 10:10.697
My clientele,

10:10.731 --> 10:14.133
they tend to shop elsewhere if they
catch a whiff of the underclass.

10:14.167 --> 10:17.436
I would rather suffer the loss
than face the bad publicity.

10:17.471 --> 10:20.606
Did you ever at any point

10:20.640 --> 10:23.709
see a blond woman wearing a coat like this

10:23.743 --> 10:26.678
- in your shop?
- I couldn't say.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.814
But I can tell you

10:28.848 --> 10:30.849
not all these pieces are mine.

10:30.883 --> 10:33.251
- Oh?
- Whomever the thief was,

10:33.285 --> 10:36.321
I was not the only target.

10:36.355 --> 10:39.390
The victim was present at the Jamieson
robbery. And likely the others as well.

10:39.425 --> 10:41.927
- She played a part in the thefts.
- Which would explain

10:41.961 --> 10:42.811
where she got her money.

10:42.812 --> 10:45.571
Right then. Crabtree, you
take Jarvis and Church Streets.

10:45.798 --> 10:48.799
I'll take King Street,
Murdoch Queen, and Charlie

10:48.834 --> 10:51.669
Wilton Street and above.
Report back as quick as you can.

10:51.703 --> 10:54.139
Sir.

11:00.846 --> 11:02.980
Let's try this other tray over here.

11:03.015 --> 11:05.750
- Excuse me, sir. I have a couple of questions...
- In a moment.

11:05.784 --> 11:08.819
Oh. Surely you have
better pieces in the back.

11:17.863 --> 11:20.131
Hello, ma'am.

11:20.165 --> 11:22.332
Rather forward, don't you think?

11:29.674 --> 11:31.908
- Hey, now.
- Oh!

11:31.942 --> 11:34.311
- Excuse me!
- Hey!

11:34.345 --> 11:35.712
Hey, stop there!

11:37.215 --> 11:39.830
- Hey, you! Come here!
- Leave me be!

11:39.831 --> 11:41.231
Give me that box!

11:41.685 --> 11:44.054
Give it to me!

11:44.088 --> 11:47.223
Give it!

11:47.257 --> 11:50.794
- But I saw you.
- I don't know what you mean!

12:07.675 --> 12:10.944
<i>Her name is Elaine Henshaw.
I've given her a dose of heroin,</i>

12:10.978 --> 12:14.213
- which has finally managed to calm her down.
- Thank you, Julia.

12:14.248 --> 12:16.349
She's of a nervous constitution.

12:16.383 --> 12:18.818
I can't imagine her a
successful shoplifter.

12:18.853 --> 12:21.621
Constable Crabtree believes
she had an accomplice.

12:21.656 --> 12:23.623
And Dr. Grace confirms

12:23.657 --> 12:25.991
that she was at the party last night.

12:26.026 --> 12:29.962
You believe she may know something
in relation to Diana White's death.

12:29.996 --> 12:31.964
A murder, a shoplifter,

12:31.998 --> 12:33.966
a coat full of stolen jewellery,

12:34.000 --> 12:37.170
all of which point back to that party.

12:37.204 --> 12:40.639
There's something else
going on here, Julia.

12:40.674 --> 12:44.677
Miss Henshaw may be the
person to tell us what that is.

12:44.711 --> 12:48.346
Good luck.

12:50.316 --> 12:53.285
You found nothing. Let me go.

12:53.319 --> 12:55.353
This isn't about

12:55.388 --> 12:57.922
the jewellery store.

12:57.956 --> 13:00.392
Do you recognize this woman?

13:05.998 --> 13:08.866
You attended a party last night.

13:08.901 --> 13:10.868
So did the woman in the photograph.

13:10.903 --> 13:13.671
And it was the last
place she was seen alive.

13:16.141 --> 13:18.342
You don't understand.

13:18.376 --> 13:20.644
The girls will kill me, too.

13:20.679 --> 13:23.380
- What girls?
- I can't say.

13:23.415 --> 13:25.516
I can't say anything.

13:25.550 --> 13:28.752
We can protect you,

13:28.786 --> 13:31.555
but you have to be truthful with me.

13:35.927 --> 13:38.429
The night Diana was killed,

13:38.463 --> 13:41.365
she said she was meeting some man.

13:41.399 --> 13:44.568
That's all I know. I swear.

13:49.306 --> 13:52.575
I'm still waiting on your report, Crabtree.

13:52.610 --> 13:53.641
Charlie, come and sit in.

13:53.642 --> 13:55.948
See if you can offer up some good
old fashioned English insight.

14:01.052 --> 14:03.786
My desk, and your position.

14:03.820 --> 14:07.390
Might as well call this
Brackenreid House Number Four.

14:07.424 --> 14:10.192
You believe there is an organized gang
of shoplifters operating in Toronto.

14:10.227 --> 14:12.895
Yet it takes a murder
before we hear about them.

14:12.929 --> 14:16.432
If they are focusing their
attentions on jewellery shops alone,

14:16.467 --> 14:19.635
they likely know that the shop
owners would rather suffer the loss

14:19.669 --> 14:22.571
- than the damage to their reputation.
- Miss Henshaw mentioned

14:22.605 --> 14:26.408
"the girls" and Constable Crabtree
saw two women conducting the theft.

14:26.442 --> 14:29.111
I'm wondering if we're
talking about a gang of women.

14:29.146 --> 14:30.321
There may be one or two women involved,

14:30.322 --> 14:32.712
- but I highly doubt...
- There is such a gang of girls

14:32.715 --> 14:35.083
in London. The Forty Elephants.

14:35.117 --> 14:37.085
Been around for a hundred years.

14:37.119 --> 14:40.722
They operate in broad daylight, steal up
half a shop, and almost never get caught.

14:40.757 --> 14:43.958
Regardless of gender,
this gang had a leader.

14:43.993 --> 14:47.296
Let's assume it was the
party's hostess, Miss White.

14:47.330 --> 14:50.265
- Then there will be a new leader taking her place.
- There's your motive.

14:50.300 --> 14:53.734
- Right, let's find these lasses and bring them in.
- A gang of women

14:53.769 --> 14:56.805
is still a gang. They live in a
culture of fear and consequence.

14:56.839 --> 14:58.940
I can't imagine any of them
will speak with you freely.

14:58.974 --> 15:02.510
If we can't talk to the ladies,
we'll talk to their fence.

15:02.544 --> 15:04.212
And I know just the one.

15:06.916 --> 15:09.317
Constable Brackenreid.

15:09.351 --> 15:11.352
What are you doing in here?

15:11.386 --> 15:13.821
Is there something I can help you with?

15:13.855 --> 15:15.823
I'm sorry, I hope I didn't startle you.

15:15.857 --> 15:18.793
I just wanted to apologize for me uncle.

15:18.827 --> 15:22.797
- Oh?
- For insisting that you come to dinner.

15:22.831 --> 15:25.344
You see, once a Brackenreid
gets an idea into his head,

15:25.345 --> 15:26.905
it's almost impossible to stop him.

15:27.001 --> 15:30.637
- I wouldn't disagree with that.
- Well, I just wanted to say,

15:30.671 --> 15:32.940
you needn't feel obliged on my account.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.508
Well,

15:35.543 --> 15:38.212
Mrs. Brackenreid is an excellent cook...

15:38.246 --> 15:40.447
It's settled, then.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.383
We might even have fun.

15:51.258 --> 15:53.693
- Eddie, put the gun down.
- Sorry.

15:53.728 --> 15:56.896
You ever seen this girl before?

15:56.930 --> 16:00.299
- Sorry, Tom. Never seen her before.
- Of course.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.336
- How's business these days?
- Can't complain.

16:03.370 --> 16:05.671
- Any jewellery coming through?
- I get the odd bit now and again.

16:05.705 --> 16:09.308
- Can't keep them on the shelves, though.
- Where were you last night?

16:09.343 --> 16:11.643
I was at a party with about
a hundred other people.

16:11.678 --> 16:14.145
- Which party was this?
- Off Cherry Street.

16:14.180 --> 16:16.181
I was there all night,
Tom. You can ask anyone.

16:16.215 --> 16:19.951
I most certainly will. Good day.

16:25.592 --> 16:27.793
Crawford wouldn't admit it, but
we do know he was at the party.

16:27.827 --> 16:30.328
The event that everything
seems to point back to.

16:30.363 --> 16:33.064
And if Eddie was the man Miss
White was supposed to be meeting...

16:33.099 --> 16:37.135
- Then perhaps he is our killer.
- I could get Charlie to stake him out,

16:37.169 --> 16:39.137
but we need hard evidence,

16:39.171 --> 16:41.206
and that's unlikely to be
found by following him around.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.275
I considered having Miss Henshaw followed,

16:43.309 --> 16:45.476
but the same problem arises.

16:45.511 --> 16:49.280
We need someone on the inside.

16:49.314 --> 16:53.250
So I'm to attend tonight's party, and
return the coat with the jewellery intact.

16:53.285 --> 16:56.186
And then once inside, I
will attempt to ascertain

16:56.221 --> 16:58.355
any knowledge the women
have about the murder

16:58.390 --> 17:00.525
and hopefully find some evidence

17:00.559 --> 17:03.527
- connected to the crime.
- The murder weapon would be ideal.

17:03.561 --> 17:06.630
Or a person wearing scratches
from the victim's diamond rings.

17:06.664 --> 17:10.467
- Miss Moss will have to join. It was her coat.
- They should have an escort.

17:10.501 --> 17:12.970
- In case something goes wrong.
- Good idea, Crabtree.

17:13.003 --> 17:15.039
- Charlie will go.
- Sir,

17:15.073 --> 17:17.107
I was thinking myself.

17:17.142 --> 17:19.410
No, George, you've been seen
in uniform by at least two

17:19.444 --> 17:21.377
- of the gang's members.
- Constable Brackenreid,

17:21.412 --> 17:24.213
you are to intervene only
if Miss Moss or Dr. Grace

17:24.248 --> 17:27.083
- are in distress.
- Understood, Detective.

17:27.117 --> 17:31.120
- We'll meet later this evening, then.
- Yes, we will.

17:31.155 --> 17:34.390
Listen. Just to be clear,
work's your priority.

17:34.425 --> 17:37.793
But seeing as you're going
to a party, you might as well

17:37.828 --> 17:41.831
show Dr. Grace a good time.

17:55.278 --> 17:57.980
Emily, this is so exciting.

17:58.014 --> 18:01.684
For the first time, I can see the
appeal of a life in law enforcement.

18:01.718 --> 18:05.420
- Remember, we are looking for a murderer.
- I remember,

18:05.455 --> 18:08.624
but I can't pretend I'm having
a good time unless I really am.

18:08.658 --> 18:12.260
You'll have a good time. I'm here.

18:12.295 --> 18:15.197
Seeing as we're trying to
get in with a group of women,

18:15.231 --> 18:17.665
we might not want a man too close by.

18:17.700 --> 18:20.035
Suit yourselves.

18:20.069 --> 18:22.737
(lively music)

18:24.840 --> 18:29.076
There a lot of places like
this is Toronto, is there?

18:29.111 --> 18:31.212
Now ladies, I'll be right here, okay?

18:31.246 --> 18:33.548
- We can handle ourselves, thank you.
- Well, if you get yourselves

18:33.582 --> 18:35.717
into a bother, you just give me a nod.

18:38.387 --> 18:39.988
That's her.

18:40.022 --> 18:42.356
The woman with the coat.

18:44.393 --> 18:46.727
I believe this is yours.

18:46.761 --> 18:48.462
And I'd like to have mine back,

18:48.497 --> 18:50.464
if you still have it.

18:50.499 --> 18:52.466
It's all there.

18:52.501 --> 18:55.969
You didn't take it. Why?

18:56.004 --> 18:59.540
- We want in.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

19:02.276 --> 19:04.310
I think you best be leaving.

19:04.345 --> 19:07.347
Listen, I don't know what your game is,

19:07.381 --> 19:10.784
but I'm not interested.

19:10.818 --> 19:12.886
He's been following me all evening.

19:12.921 --> 19:15.088
Honestly. Do I look like that sort of girl?

19:16.723 --> 19:19.159
We could have gone to
the police, but we didn't.

19:20.093 --> 19:22.095
Wait here.

19:26.934 --> 19:28.290
- We did it.
- Maybe.

19:28.291 --> 19:29.291
Oh, Emily,

19:29.403 --> 19:31.704
you can't tell me you're not a
little bit excited by all of this.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.907
No. I can't tell you that. (Laughing)

19:34.942 --> 19:37.142
Your hair...

19:39.145 --> 19:41.080
Perfect.

19:41.114 --> 19:43.916
Put it in the back.

19:43.951 --> 19:46.652
Oh, thank you.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.961
I wouldn't waste my time.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.464
- What do you know about it?
- Those women,

19:58.498 --> 20:00.599
they're devoted to each other.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.969
You know, "devoted friends."

20:06.639 --> 20:10.008
You two.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.559
- Emily, right?
- Mm-hmm.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.560
And Lillian.

20:22.187 --> 20:26.290
I'm Helen. That's Elaine
and Mary. We don't stand

20:26.325 --> 20:28.092
- on ceremony around here.
- Hello.

20:28.127 --> 20:30.961
Why did you bring them back
here? The last thing we need

20:30.996 --> 20:33.564
- is a couple of new girls messing everything up.
- You're one to talk,

20:33.599 --> 20:36.100
- getting caught up by that constable.
- So,

20:36.135 --> 20:38.602
how did you hear about our parties?

20:38.637 --> 20:42.172
- From someone named Diana.
- Must have been before she turned up dead.

20:42.206 --> 20:44.675
- She's dead?
- Murdered, just down the street.

20:44.709 --> 20:47.144
No one knows who did
it. Not even the coppers.

20:47.178 --> 20:50.748
- But my money's on Beatrice.
- Shut up, Mary.

20:50.782 --> 20:53.316
- Who's Beatrice?
- If she likes you, you're in.

20:53.351 --> 20:56.853
And if she doesn't, you'll
end up like Diana. We all will.

20:56.887 --> 21:00.323
Here she comes.

21:08.566 --> 21:11.567
I hear you've come bearing gifts.

21:17.874 --> 21:20.608
<i>The coat belongs to Helen Conroy, a widow</i>

21:20.643 --> 21:22.744
who relies on the gang as
her main source of income.

21:22.778 --> 21:26.415
Mary Puddle is with them for
fun. She's a bored society girl.

21:26.449 --> 21:30.118
If a salacious story is a
motive, she could be your killer.

21:30.153 --> 21:33.922
Elaine Henshaw, whom you
already know, is a nervous sort.

21:33.957 --> 21:35.924
She seems to be in fear of her roommate,

21:35.959 --> 21:38.159
Beatrice Crawford. The new leader.

21:38.193 --> 21:39.828
Crawford? As in...

21:39.862 --> 21:43.397
Yes, her brother, Eddie Crawford,
who fences their stolen goods.

21:43.432 --> 21:46.491
And you believe Beatrice
Crawford has the strongest motive.

21:46.492 --> 21:47.062
I do.

21:47.069 --> 21:50.738
Most importantly, she bears the
scars that match Diana White's rings.

21:50.773 --> 21:54.108
Right. Very good work, Doctor.

21:54.142 --> 21:57.511
- Thank you for your help.
- I'd like to have a little chat with this Crawford woman.

21:57.545 --> 21:59.480
See if we can't squeeze out a confession.

21:59.514 --> 22:02.083
Oh, I doubt she'll confess to
anything, sir, without evidence.

22:02.117 --> 22:04.151
If I may,

22:04.186 --> 22:06.653
Miss Moss and I have been invited along

22:06.688 --> 22:09.056
to a shoplifting scheme at two o'clock.

22:09.091 --> 22:11.291
Perhaps if you caught them in the act?

22:13.127 --> 22:16.797
- We could always use it as leverage.
- Beatrice may not confess,

22:16.831 --> 22:19.332
- but the other girls may say something of use.
- We may as well

22:19.367 --> 22:21.802
use the diversion to search
Beatrice Crawford's rooms.

22:21.836 --> 22:23.370
We'll get something out
one way or the other.

22:44.090 --> 22:46.926
These would look beautiful on you.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.961
You should try this.

22:51.832 --> 22:55.134
I don't like any of this.

22:55.168 --> 22:57.904
I would like to see
what's in the case, please.

22:59.939 --> 23:01.907
I require immediate service.

23:01.941 --> 23:04.876
I have a function this evening and
not a single necklace worth wearing.

23:04.911 --> 23:06.578
In a moment, madam.

23:09.016 --> 23:12.117
Oh, that would really bring
out the green in your eyes.

23:16.055 --> 23:19.691
Oh, miss, I believe this is yours.

23:19.725 --> 23:22.727
- Yes. Thank you.
- I know you.

23:22.762 --> 23:26.097
- You tried to rob me.
- Me? I... Yes, you and the other one!

23:26.131 --> 23:28.199
Get back here!

23:28.233 --> 23:30.741
- Go. You have to leave, now.
- I can't take it. If I take it,

23:30.742 --> 23:31.742
the whole plan will be ruined.

23:31.837 --> 23:35.406
You don't have a choice. Come on.

23:35.441 --> 23:39.410
- Come with me, young lady.
- What, can't a girl spend money?

23:39.445 --> 23:41.410
You and your cohorts had no
intention of buying anything.

23:41.411 --> 23:42.811
I've never seen these ladies

23:42.814 --> 23:44.982
- before in my life.
- Get in the wagon. In the wagon.

23:48.153 --> 23:50.054
Bollocks.

24:07.371 --> 24:09.672
Was that really necessary, Doctor?

24:09.707 --> 24:12.008
- Overplaying it a bit, don't you think?
- I'm afraid not.

24:14.145 --> 24:17.314
Crikey.

24:17.348 --> 24:19.549
So, how are you finding it here?

24:19.584 --> 24:22.118
Must be a bit boring
compared to London, England.

24:22.152 --> 24:24.120
Yeah, it is, I suppose.

24:24.154 --> 24:26.122
Why is it again that you came?

24:26.156 --> 24:28.725
I can't recall the Inspector saying.

24:28.759 --> 24:31.928
Seemed best for everyone
I left London for a while.

24:31.962 --> 24:34.597
Besides, my uncle is a good bloke.

24:34.632 --> 24:36.666
He treats me like a son.

24:36.700 --> 24:39.502
And there are some very pretty girls.

24:39.536 --> 24:42.070
Yes, there are indeed.

24:42.105 --> 24:44.072
I'll take this bedroom.

24:44.107 --> 24:47.243
Talking of girls,

24:47.277 --> 24:50.246
I've been here a few days and the only
women I've come across are two lady doctors

24:50.280 --> 24:52.814
and a female gang.

24:52.849 --> 24:56.184
Well, perhaps we're
not so boring after all.

24:56.218 --> 24:59.154
Say, what do you know about
this coroner, Dr. Grace?

25:01.157 --> 25:03.725
I know she's excellent at her job.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.494
She's not likely to be wrong, is she?

25:08.497 --> 25:10.465
Almost never.

25:10.499 --> 25:13.067
And what about fellows?

25:13.101 --> 25:15.436
I don't know, Charlie.

25:15.471 --> 25:17.805
Our relationship is professional.

25:17.839 --> 25:19.807
I expected as much.

25:19.841 --> 25:22.177
What do you mean by that, exactly?

25:22.211 --> 25:24.710
I just mean I wouldn't
expect a woman of her quality

25:24.711 --> 25:26.011
to hang around with a copper, is all.

25:26.014 --> 25:28.849
Though every rule does have an exception.

25:30.185 --> 25:32.153
Did you find something?

25:32.187 --> 25:34.155
Some blood on a handkerchief,

25:34.189 --> 25:36.490
and a soiled glove that
might be significant.

25:36.524 --> 25:38.993
They might be.

25:39.027 --> 25:42.096
But likely not as significant as this.

25:45.933 --> 25:49.403
- How did they know to find us?
- We shouldn't have hit the same shop twice in one week.

25:49.437 --> 25:52.005
- I told you it was a bad idea.
- Shut up.

25:52.039 --> 25:54.074
Just keep your mouths shut

25:54.108 --> 25:56.176
and we'll be out of here in no time.

25:56.211 --> 25:59.379
- Except Emily, you mean.
- A pretty girl like her

25:59.414 --> 26:01.647
will get a year in the workhouse at most.

26:01.682 --> 26:03.649
It goes by quickly enough.

26:03.684 --> 26:07.486
- A year? And you're alright with that?
- She's new.

26:07.521 --> 26:08.888
She got caught.

26:08.923 --> 26:11.224
- She won't get caught again.
- Why were the coppers there

26:11.258 --> 26:13.226
at exactly two o'clock with a paddy wagon?

26:13.260 --> 26:16.596
- They must have known we would be there.
- How would they have known?

26:16.630 --> 26:19.265
Yes, how would they have known?

26:19.299 --> 26:23.769
- The new girl. Did you squeal?
- I didn't say a word!

26:23.803 --> 26:26.038
- It was me.
- What?

26:26.072 --> 26:29.007
- I work for the police.
- Oh, what?

26:29.042 --> 26:44.056
The police! I guess your
plan didn't go too well.

26:44.090 --> 26:46.202
And you know that's no idle threat.

26:46.213 --> 26:47.323
Enjoy the workhouse.

26:47.327 --> 26:51.630
It's only a year. It'll
go by quickly enough.

26:56.302 --> 26:57.869
So, Doctor. That was a bit of a cock-up.

26:57.903 --> 27:00.104
I don't know why the plan
changed. Miss Moss and I

27:00.139 --> 27:02.240
were supposed to be the
distraction, never the runners.

27:02.275 --> 27:04.476
It was an admirable attempt, Doctor.

27:04.510 --> 27:06.911
- Thank you.
- So we've managed

27:06.945 --> 27:08.913
to not only lose our man on the inside,

27:08.947 --> 27:11.649
but we most likely don't have enough
leverage against any of the girls.

27:11.683 --> 27:14.752
We'll simply have to find a
different course of action.

27:14.787 --> 27:17.554
- Any suggestions?
- Maybe this'll be

27:17.589 --> 27:20.825
of some use. The murder weapon.

27:20.859 --> 27:22.927
Oh, good work, son.

27:22.961 --> 27:26.096
- I just got lucky.
- It's nothing to do with luck. Eh, Crabtree?

27:26.130 --> 27:30.066
- He's a natural. It's in the blood.
- Natural indeed, sir.

27:30.101 --> 27:32.068
Well, George,

27:32.103 --> 27:34.338
we'll have to test that
for fingermarks. No need.

27:34.372 --> 27:37.608
I found the knife in the
room of one Beatrice Crawford.

27:42.313 --> 27:45.615
You appear to have taken
up Miss White's mantel.

27:45.649 --> 27:47.684
That's motive.

27:47.718 --> 27:49.786
Also, the marks on your neck

27:49.821 --> 27:51.855
are an exact match for the rings

27:51.889 --> 27:54.925
that were found on Miss White's hands.

27:54.959 --> 27:57.560
And there's this.

27:57.594 --> 28:00.129
The knife that was used to kill Miss White.

28:00.163 --> 28:02.665
It was found in your room.

28:02.700 --> 28:05.301
Motive, and evidence.

28:05.336 --> 28:08.971
That's not mine. I didn't kill Diana.

28:09.005 --> 28:13.175
Besides, she wasn't stabbed. She was shot.

28:13.210 --> 28:14.977
- Shot?
- Yes,

28:15.011 --> 28:17.679
shot. After she hit me,

28:17.714 --> 28:20.850
she left. Some business meeting with a man.

28:20.884 --> 28:23.152
I knew it wasn't Eddie

28:23.186 --> 28:25.888
and I was annoyed she would
ally us with someone else.

28:25.922 --> 28:28.257
So I tried to find her.

28:28.291 --> 28:31.727
I heard a gunshot. I followed the sound.

28:31.761 --> 28:34.128
I found her dead in that laneway.

28:34.163 --> 28:36.130
Shot dead.

28:36.165 --> 28:38.633
That's your story?

28:38.668 --> 28:40.769
That's the truth.

28:43.105 --> 28:45.374
Sir.

28:45.408 --> 28:47.508
Full report on the search
of Beatrice Crawford's flat.

28:47.542 --> 28:51.079
Mine and Constable
Brackenreid's, wherever he is.

28:51.113 --> 28:53.581
I don't feel like you're
getting on with my nephew,

28:53.615 --> 28:56.885
- Crabtree.
- Some people just don't get on, sir.

28:56.919 --> 29:00.588
- He's not a bad sort.
- If you say so.

29:00.622 --> 29:02.323
Did he tell you why he came here?

29:02.358 --> 29:05.926
Well, I asked him, sir, but
his answer was a bit vague.

29:05.960 --> 29:09.360
This is for your ears only, understand?

29:10.800 --> 29:13.775
Charlie saw his best pal, a young
lad by the name of Harry Keating,

29:13.776 --> 29:15.566
murdered right in front of his own eyes,

29:15.570 --> 29:17.971
in fact right in front
of half of London's eyes,

29:18.006 --> 29:21.408
- for that matter.
- Sir, that's terrible.

29:21.442 --> 29:23.777
He was the only one with
the guts to come forward.

29:23.811 --> 29:25.778
It came down to his word
against the killer's.

29:25.812 --> 29:29.348
Some fancy lawyering made it look like
Charlie was lying. The murderer got off,

29:29.383 --> 29:33.552
- and a price was put on Charlie's head.
- Sir. I had no idea.

29:33.586 --> 29:35.922
He tried to do the right thing, George.

29:35.956 --> 29:38.124
He deserves a fair shot.

29:38.158 --> 29:40.359
I would appreciate it if
you would give him that.

29:40.394 --> 29:43.862
- Sir, of course.
- (Men laughing)

29:43.897 --> 29:47.132
Now's as good a time as any.

29:47.166 --> 29:49.701
Rafferty, crack open this champagne.

29:49.736 --> 29:51.703
Charlie, come here, son, come here.

29:51.738 --> 29:55.240
Lads, I'd like to announce a new record,

29:55.274 --> 29:57.242
a constable solving a case

29:57.276 --> 29:59.244
within his first
forty-eight hours on the job.

29:59.278 --> 30:02.480
Well now, Inspector, I
can't take all the credit.

30:02.514 --> 30:05.150
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have
been here to find the knife, so...

30:05.184 --> 30:07.218
Quite right, quite right.

30:07.253 --> 30:09.754
I always knew that Charlie
would be a good copper.

30:09.788 --> 30:11.823
It's just something that you're born with,

30:11.857 --> 30:14.359
and a Brackenreid is
as born to it as anyone.

30:14.393 --> 30:16.527
Lads, a toast.

30:16.562 --> 30:19.664
To Constable Charles Brackenreid.

30:24.770 --> 30:28.105
Blood?

30:31.809 --> 30:33.978
Dr. Grace.

30:34.012 --> 30:36.013
May I call you Emily?

30:38.016 --> 30:40.517
- It's a shame you missed the champagne.
- Constable Brackenreid.

30:40.551 --> 30:42.619
What can I do for you?

30:42.653 --> 30:44.045
I was wondering what
time I should escort you

30:44.046 --> 30:45.514
to my Uncle's house
for dinner this evening?

30:45.790 --> 30:48.492
Dinner. I'm sorry, I'm distracted.

30:48.526 --> 30:51.628
I can't imagine how blood found
its way onto Miss White's finger.

30:51.662 --> 30:54.898
From when she pulled the knife
out. You said so yourself.

30:54.932 --> 30:56.967
But I distinctly remember
cleaning her hand.

30:57.001 --> 30:58.969
I suppose you missed a spot.

31:02.172 --> 31:04.507
What were you doing in
the morgue yesterday?

31:04.541 --> 31:07.710
I was being friendly.

31:07.744 --> 31:09.838
- You remember.
- You were in here alone.

31:09.839 --> 31:11.259
Were you tampering with the body?

31:11.415 --> 31:13.616
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking

31:13.650 --> 31:17.153
about the blood on the victim's finger I am certain I cleaned.
- Now, Emily, I...

31:17.187 --> 31:19.688
If you'll excuse me, I have a few
things to discuss with your uncle.

31:19.723 --> 31:21.991
You should watch yourself, Doctor.

31:22.025 --> 31:25.293
You see, I know what you are.

31:25.328 --> 31:29.398
I saw you and that Moss woman.
"Devoted friends," as they say.

31:29.432 --> 31:30.742
- Pardon me?
- Wouldn't go over too well

31:30.743 --> 31:32.035
- with the men who employ you.
- How dare you...

31:32.038 --> 31:34.469
You best shut your mouth
about what you think you saw,

31:34.904 --> 31:38.006
and I'll shut mine about what I know I saw.

31:50.712 --> 31:53.814
Ah, Dr. Grace. Do come in, have a seat.

31:53.849 --> 31:56.250
Hope you've worked up a good appetite.

31:56.284 --> 31:59.186
Mrs. B's been slaving
over a hot stove all day.

32:03.224 --> 32:07.428
I believe Constable
Brackenreid has done something.

32:07.462 --> 32:09.163
What do you mean?

32:09.438 --> 32:12.773
I believe he has tampered with
a body. Diana White's body.

32:12.807 --> 32:14.775
I found him in the morgue yesterday,

32:14.809 --> 32:17.111
alone.

32:17.145 --> 32:19.379
As are all of your attendants
at one time or another.

32:19.413 --> 32:21.849
Yes, but I found blood

32:21.883 --> 32:24.084
on a finger I had already cleaned.

32:28.256 --> 32:30.223
What are you suggesting?

32:30.258 --> 32:32.559
It seems a great coincidence, Inspector,

32:32.593 --> 32:34.561
that your nephew should
find the murder weapon

32:34.595 --> 32:37.264
with the victim's fingerprint on its hilt.

32:37.298 --> 32:40.800
That's one hell of an
accusation to make, Dr. Grace.

32:40.834 --> 32:43.770
You can't go around
maligning a man's good name

32:43.804 --> 32:45.905
with only vague suspicion as proof.

32:45.939 --> 32:48.141
I regret that my word

32:48.175 --> 32:50.176
is not enough to convince you.

33:00.019 --> 33:03.355
Autumn is most certainly upon us.
You can feel the chill in the air.

33:03.390 --> 33:06.892
- Mmm. Very warm.
- William!

33:06.926 --> 33:10.062
What are you thinking about?
It certainly isn't the weather.

33:10.096 --> 33:12.498
I'm sorry, Julia. I'm having trouble

33:12.532 --> 33:15.767
reconciling Beatrice Crawford's
account of the murder.

33:15.802 --> 33:18.469
She could well be lying. She is a criminal.

33:18.504 --> 33:21.472
Yes, but why say she was shot

33:21.507 --> 33:24.976
when we know she was
stabbed? Why be so specific?

33:25.011 --> 33:26.978
A diversionary tactic?

33:27.013 --> 33:30.615
It relies on a completely
different set of circumstances.

33:30.649 --> 33:33.351
It's ill-conceived.

33:33.385 --> 33:36.120
No, if, as Beatrice Crawford says,

33:36.154 --> 33:38.923
there was a gunshot, then
there would be evidence of it

33:38.957 --> 33:41.792
- at the scene of the crime.
- Then perhaps you should look,

33:41.827 --> 33:45.230
- if only to satisfy your curiosity.
- It so happens

33:45.264 --> 33:48.499
we find ourselves in the exact
location the murder occurred.

33:48.534 --> 33:50.500
What an unlikely coincidence.

33:50.535 --> 33:52.436
Hmm.

33:52.470 --> 33:55.873
William, you do realise that Miss
Crawford is a master of manipulation.

33:55.907 --> 33:59.276
She could well be simply insinuating doubt.

33:59.310 --> 34:01.545
I don't see how that could work.

34:01.579 --> 34:05.216
You've shown yourself to be a man of
reason, so any unreasonable element

34:05.250 --> 34:07.551
would likely prey on your mind.

34:09.554 --> 34:12.989
Or there could be a simpler explanation.

34:13.023 --> 34:16.726
What would that be?

34:16.761 --> 34:18.428
She was telling the truth.

34:33.844 --> 34:36.478
Dr. Grace missed an excellent meal.

34:36.513 --> 34:40.014
- What exactly was the reason she gave?
- She was busy.

34:40.049 --> 34:43.485
Nothing to do with you being
in the morgue alone, then?

34:43.520 --> 34:45.721
As she well knows, I was waiting for her.

34:45.755 --> 34:47.723
I was trying to be friendly.

34:47.757 --> 34:50.159
How was I to know my attentions
would be so unwelcome?

34:50.193 --> 34:52.661
- Did she say that to you?
- She didn't have to.

34:52.696 --> 34:55.563
I can't believe she told you.

34:55.598 --> 34:56.449
What, about you being in the morgue?

34:58.868 --> 35:01.469
- were supposed to be secret.
- You're gonna believe her?

35:01.504 --> 35:03.571
And just what do you think she said?

35:05.404 --> 35:06.220
You do believe her.

35:08.021 --> 35:10.270
You take the word of a Sapphist
over that of your own blood.

35:10.328 --> 35:11.513
A Sapphist?

35:11.577 --> 35:14.146
- You don't know that about her?
- I don't give a toss.

35:14.180 --> 35:17.182
If you've been up to anything
untoward, I will find out.

35:17.306 --> 35:20.175
So, have you anything to tell me?

35:20.209 --> 35:23.145
Of course not, Uncle Tommy.

35:27.616 --> 35:29.584
(footsteps approaching)

35:29.618 --> 35:32.453
- Dr. Grace.
- I felt the need

35:32.487 --> 35:35.089
to re-examine the evidence
I lifted from the body.

35:35.123 --> 35:38.292
Inclusive of that, I tested the
charcoal traces I found in the wound.

35:38.326 --> 35:40.461
- And?
- It was charcoal,

35:40.495 --> 35:43.197
sulphur, and saltpeter.

35:43.296 --> 35:45.264
Gunpowder.

35:45.298 --> 35:47.266
Likely dragged into the wound

35:47.300 --> 35:49.502
from traces found on Miss White's clothing?

35:49.536 --> 35:51.703
No. The residue was found only

35:51.738 --> 35:53.739
at the insertion point of the knife.

35:53.773 --> 35:57.243
It must have been transferred
to the wound by the knife itself.

35:57.277 --> 36:00.646
So the killer was holding
the knife in close proximity

36:00.680 --> 36:03.115
when he fired the gun.

36:03.149 --> 36:06.084
- That looks rather awkward.
- It certainly does.

36:06.119 --> 36:09.087
Could one person have done this?

36:09.122 --> 36:12.257
Not one person. One weapon.

36:12.291 --> 36:15.560
Take away the barrel, fix a
blade in the brass knuckle handle,

36:15.594 --> 36:19.264
and you've got yourself an Apache.
A three-in-one weapon from Paris.

36:19.298 --> 36:21.599
Last time I saw one was
in the East End of London.

36:21.634 --> 36:22.629
Sir, that can't be.

36:22.630 --> 36:25.311
We know that this stiletto
found in Miss Crawford's room

36:25.403 --> 36:28.738
- is the murder weapon.
- No, Murdoch. It isn't.

36:28.773 --> 36:30.740
That's what Charlie
was doing in the morgue,

36:30.775 --> 36:33.644
wasn't it? Putting Miss
White's fingermarks on the hilt.

36:35.647 --> 36:38.549
I feel as though I'm missing
a vital piece of information.

36:38.583 --> 36:41.250
Charlie planted the
weapon. I'll deal with him.

36:41.285 --> 36:44.353
But our first priority is
to find the real killer.

36:45.990 --> 36:48.058
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

36:48.092 --> 36:50.126
I know there's an Apache in Toronto,

36:50.161 --> 36:52.328
and I bet my whole kit and
caboodle that you've got it.

36:52.362 --> 36:54.330
You know me, Inspector.

36:54.364 --> 36:56.632
Lover of curiosities and collector's items.

36:56.667 --> 36:58.734
It's right over here.

36:58.768 --> 37:00.736
It's a terrible weapon.

37:00.770 --> 37:03.306
No barrel, no sights;
it's practically useless

37:03.340 --> 37:05.974
unless you're right on top of the person.

37:06.009 --> 37:08.010
I can't bring myself
to part with it, though.

37:08.044 --> 37:11.247
The ladies love to hear stories
of the fearsome Parisian gang,

37:11.281 --> 37:13.515
Les Apaches. (Clicking tongue)

37:15.685 --> 37:18.921
- And you're just handing it to me.
- Why wouldn't I?

37:18.955 --> 37:20.923
Well, this may well be the weapon

37:20.957 --> 37:23.158
that killed Diana White. (Clicking tongue)

37:23.193 --> 37:26.128
Oh.

37:26.162 --> 37:29.598
It's been recently
fired. Gunpowder residue.

37:29.632 --> 37:32.133
Blood residue on the stiletto blade

37:32.167 --> 37:34.436
which matches the wound on the victim.

37:34.470 --> 37:38.139
No sign of a misfire. So
why would the killer shoot

37:38.173 --> 37:41.175
at Miss White, and then stab her?

37:41.210 --> 37:43.144
The gun is only good at close range.

37:43.178 --> 37:46.848
Assuming the killer didn't know
that, he may have shot first,

37:46.882 --> 37:48.983
missed, lost his advantage

37:49.017 --> 37:50.985
and then been forced to
close in for the kill.

37:51.019 --> 37:54.122
Beatrice Crawford is still
our strongest suspect.

37:54.156 --> 37:56.791
And she had free access
to her brother's pawn shop.

37:56.825 --> 37:59.040
Did you find the first set
of fingermarks on the weapon?

37:59.041 --> 38:00.071
Nothing legible.

38:00.328 --> 38:02.296
Unlucky for us.

38:02.330 --> 38:04.531
Regardless, we need to
find some genuine evidence.

38:04.566 --> 38:07.434
Sir, isn't there a box

38:07.469 --> 38:10.070
of Beatrice Crawford's items
we've yet to go through?

38:10.104 --> 38:12.339
There is indeed.

38:12.374 --> 38:14.708
Where's the rest of the evidence

38:14.743 --> 38:17.110
- from Miss Crawford's rooms?
- It's here.

38:17.145 --> 38:19.813
Crabtree. Bring it in.

38:19.847 --> 38:23.216
Well, chop-chop.

38:23.251 --> 38:25.252
Yes, sir.

38:27.255 --> 38:29.656
Sirs.

38:29.690 --> 38:32.926
I'm not entirely sure how useful
any of this is. But may I ask,

38:32.960 --> 38:35.828
- why the need for additional evidence?
- You may not.

38:37.931 --> 38:41.668
Well, there's a handkerchief with
a small amount of blood on it.

38:41.702 --> 38:44.904
Too small of an amount
to link to the crime.

38:44.938 --> 38:47.707
A pocket watch that's stopped at 8:47.

38:47.741 --> 38:49.742
Because it's unwound.

38:49.777 --> 38:51.844
And the victim wasn't killed at 8:47.

38:51.878 --> 38:54.880
Which leads me to believe that
Miss Crawford will get away with it.

38:54.915 --> 38:57.716
That's more or less it, sir.

38:57.750 --> 38:59.751
Besides this soiled glove.

39:01.454 --> 39:05.057
George.

39:07.060 --> 39:08.960
Gunpowder residue.

39:08.994 --> 39:10.962
We may still have enough evidence

39:10.996 --> 39:12.964
to link Beatrice Crawford
to the murder, sir.

39:12.998 --> 39:15.099
Sir, that's not Beatrice Crawford's.

39:15.134 --> 39:17.402
That glove belongs to Elaine Henshaw.

39:19.104 --> 39:22.240
You almost had us fooled, Miss Henshaw.

39:22.274 --> 39:24.242
I know the how.

39:24.276 --> 39:26.577
I just don't know the why.

39:26.611 --> 39:28.746
Will it change anything?

39:28.780 --> 39:32.083
Juries have been known to be merciful.

39:34.086 --> 39:37.088
I did a job on the side, by myself.

39:37.122 --> 39:39.290
I fenced it through Eddie.

39:39.325 --> 39:41.659
Diana found out

39:41.693 --> 39:44.161
and was going to kick me out of the gang.

39:44.195 --> 39:46.930
I couldn't let that happen.

39:46.965 --> 39:49.266
And for that she had to die?

39:49.300 --> 39:52.470
You wouldn't understand.

39:52.504 --> 39:55.806
I knew Beatrice would be next in line.

39:55.841 --> 39:57.975
She would take care of me.

39:58.009 --> 40:01.011
Those girls are all I have in the world.

40:01.045 --> 40:03.646
We're family.

40:03.681 --> 40:05.615
I couldn't survive without them.

40:05.649 --> 40:09.786
And yet they will probably
survive without you.

40:15.158 --> 40:17.293
You wanted to see me, Uncle Tommy?

40:17.327 --> 40:19.496
I am not your uncle.

40:19.530 --> 40:22.265
I'm your Inspector.

40:22.299 --> 40:25.668
There are no second chances
in this line of work, lad.

40:25.703 --> 40:28.505
What we do affects people's lives.

40:28.539 --> 40:31.840
You almost sent an innocent
woman to the noose. Innocent?

40:31.875 --> 40:35.011
She's a criminal. She
deserves to be punished.

40:35.045 --> 40:38.314
- She doesn't deserve to be executed.
- This is London all over again.

40:38.348 --> 40:41.884
Is that why you did this? To
make right what went wrong?

40:41.919 --> 40:45.288
I watched Harry die.

40:45.322 --> 40:47.290
I saw who killed him.

40:47.324 --> 40:49.291
No one said anything.

40:49.325 --> 40:51.860
I risked my life to do
what was right for Harry.

40:51.895 --> 40:55.363
- But I had no evidence.
- Just like we had no evidence.

40:55.398 --> 40:57.999
What I did was right.

40:58.034 --> 41:01.069
- It had to be right.
- No, it wasn't, son.

41:01.103 --> 41:03.238
And because you don't know that,

41:03.272 --> 41:06.874
I can't have you in my
Station House. Or my home.

41:06.909 --> 41:09.177
You can't send me back.

41:11.013 --> 41:13.648
- I'm a dead man.
- I've got you a job

41:13.682 --> 41:15.683
on a merchant ship sailing to New Zealand.

41:15.717 --> 41:18.253
You have a cousin in Auckland.
He'll be expecting you.

41:20.556 --> 41:23.925
Your friend Harry would have
been a good and honest man.

41:23.959 --> 41:26.060
Walk in his footsteps,

41:26.094 --> 41:28.729
don't live in his shadow.

41:41.830 --> 41:44.815
Crabtree? See through that
Higgins takes back his desk.

41:44.816 --> 41:45.716
Sir, I will.

41:45.871 --> 41:48.203
And may I say I'm very sorry
about everything with your nephew.

41:48.207 --> 41:51.042
- He'd have made a good constable.
- Yes, well.

41:51.077 --> 41:54.279
This Station House already has better.

42:00.552 --> 42:03.721
I thought you'd like to know that
my nephew's been sent on his way.

42:03.755 --> 42:06.524
I'm sorry about the whole thing, Inspector.

42:06.558 --> 42:09.126
Please, Doctor. I should
be the one to apologize.

42:09.160 --> 42:12.796
I should have believed you
when you first came to see me.

42:12.830 --> 42:15.399
One more thing.

42:15.433 --> 42:17.534
I don't know if it's true,
and I don't want to know.

42:17.568 --> 42:20.704
- But Charlie said something...
- Oh?

42:20.738 --> 42:24.508
I don't want to lose you
as city coroner, that's all.

42:24.542 --> 42:28.077
I appreciate your concern, Inspector,
but what I do in my free time

42:28.112 --> 42:30.780
has no bearing on my work.

42:30.815 --> 42:33.717
That's not the way the world works,
young lady. These kind of shenanigans

42:33.751 --> 42:35.719
- are not for a woman of your position.
- Shenanigans?

42:35.753 --> 42:37.721
You know this to be true.

42:37.755 --> 42:39.990
Now, you've had your fun.

42:40.024 --> 42:43.092
It's time to grow up and
act in a proper fashion.

42:59.743 --> 43:03.178
(knocking)

43:03.212 --> 43:05.213
Emily. What's the matter...

43:07.416 --> 43:09.383
Is this what you want?

43:09.418 --> 43:12.219
- Yes.
- I'm not a toy.

43:12.254 --> 43:14.656
I'm too grown up for toys.
