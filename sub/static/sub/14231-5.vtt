[Max stammering] Are you sure
I can't help you with that?

13:14.085 --> 13:17.464
Nope! Why don't you go ahead
and get the food ready to cook?

13:18.048 --> 13:20.425
[sighs] OK, Pop!

13:22.010 --> 13:24.846
Look at that! Ah-hyuck!
I nearly missed a piece!

13:56.795 --> 13:59.255
Whoa!

13:59.339 --> 14:02.342
Huh! Well, that takes care of that!

14:03.843 --> 14:05.845
Hey! What do you...

14:09.516 --> 14:11.685
Help!

14:13.019 --> 14:17.982
[raft squealing]

14:18.233 --> 14:20.443

14:26.866 --> 14:29.661
Who in blue blazes
do you think you... [gasps]

14:29.953 --> 14:31.204
A bear!

14:31.287 --> 14:33.039

14:37.502 --> 14:39.170
Look! A baby bear!

14:40.463 --> 14:42.382
What's he doing here all alone?

14:44.509 --> 14:47.012
Oh, maybe he's lost and needs some help.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.222
Max, that's a bear!

14:49.889 --> 14:51.016
Let's see if he needs help.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.934
See if he needs help?

14:55.562 --> 14:57.564

15:05.572 --> 15:08.074

15:08.158 --> 15:10.910
[Pete] Whoa!

15:10.994 --> 15:15.040
Run for your lives! Call the militia!
Wild bears on the loose!

You mean that thing right behind you?

15:24.549 --> 15:25.675
[Pete] But that's not...

15:25.759 --> 15:27.761
I mean, that's what-- down by the river...

15:27.844 --> 15:29.804
I think bears are bigger, Petey.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.931
That's it! I've had it!

15:32.057 --> 15:35.018
This woods isn't big enough
for us and your small mind!

15:35.101 --> 15:38.355
-We're leaving!
-No, we're leaving.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.024
Anyplace is better with you not in it.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.734
-P.J.!
-Max!

15:42.817 --> 15:44.069
[both] We're leaving!

15:44.152 --> 15:45.945
Where is that kid?

15:46.029 --> 15:49.324
I don't like them wandering off
when there's bears around.

15:56.539 --> 16:00.085
[both] Bears? The bears got our boys!

16:05.632 --> 16:08.301
[both] The bears got our boys!

16:08.385 --> 16:10.178
The bears got our boys!

16:10.303 --> 16:12.222
The bears got our boys!

16:12.639 --> 16:15.892
-Gawrsh! What will we do?
-Come on, Goof.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.479
I know just how to handle this!

16:19.604 --> 16:21.398
What are we doing now, Pete?

16:21.481 --> 16:25.235
We're doing what a man
in the wilderness has to do

16:25.360 --> 16:26.820
if he's any kind of a man at all!

16:26.945 --> 16:29.072
We're hunting bear.

16:29.197 --> 16:32.909
Bare? Ah-hyuck! Gawrsh!
I'm freezing as it is.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.704
Now let's see. Rifles, traps, ropes,

16:35.787 --> 16:38.665
net, moose call, decoys...

16:38.790 --> 16:40.917
Oh, yeah! I nearly forget the bullets!

16:41.001 --> 16:42.877
[Goofy]
Maybe they're in your pocket.

16:44.838 --> 16:48.758

16:49.342 --> 16:52.012

16:52.095 --> 16:53.513
he just don't quit.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.019
Hmm, what's he up to now?

16:59.144 --> 17:03.273
Whoa! Oopsie!

17:03.773 --> 17:04.733
Whew!

17:04.816 --> 17:07.736
Oh, oh, thanks, Goof.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.071
Ah-hyuck! No problem, ol' Petey-boy.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.741

17:12.824 --> 17:14.284
-Good idea, Pete!
-[splash]

17:14.409 --> 17:16.703

17:20.540 --> 17:23.960

Son? Son!

17:34.220 --> 17:36.097
No! My son!

17:36.181 --> 17:38.641

17:50.987 --> 17:54.324
Gawrsh, from up here I'll be able
to see every little...

17:54.824 --> 17:56.409
thing.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.540

by a bear or something.

18:35.323 --> 18:36.866
Uh, maybe we ought to go back, Max.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.035
I mean, that bear is a wild animal.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.871

Oh...

-[softly] Why isn't he running away?

18:50.588 --> 18:53.008
Because, it's just like I told you.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.010
-He needs our help.
-Help him do what?

18:55.135 --> 18:58.179
Find his huge, angry, hungry parents
so they can eat us?

18:58.263 --> 19:00.515
Remember the three rules of camping.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.185
"Be clean, be courteous and be careful".

19:04.310 --> 19:06.521
[normal voice] Helping this little guy
is the courteous thing to do.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.399
You'll let me know when we hit that
part about "careful."

19:09.482 --> 19:10.567
Trust me!

Oh, hi, Pete. Ah-hyuck!

19:43.183 --> 19:44.976
Any luck with that bear?

19:45.101 --> 19:48.480
Guess not. OK, Pete, now what do I do?

19:48.605 --> 19:50.857
Just dangle there and look delicious,

19:50.940 --> 19:53.818
