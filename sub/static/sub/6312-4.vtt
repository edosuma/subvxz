WEBVTT

00:03.670 --> 00:06.138
(light clacking)

00:06.170 --> 00:08.331
*

00:18.480 --> 00:19.617
Here's a question
we should have asked

00:19.650 --> 00:21.345
ten minutes ago.

00:21.380 --> 00:23.541
What if these cuffs
really are un-pickable?

00:23.590 --> 00:26.457
Claiming a new line of handcuffs
to be "un-pickable"

00:26.490 --> 00:27.684
is the equivalent
of proclaiming

00:27.720 --> 00:29.278
revamped laundry detergent

00:29.330 --> 00:31.252
"new and improved"--
it's a marketing ploy,

00:31.290 --> 00:33.349
and not a very original one
at that.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.197
I'm just saying,
maybe we should have figured out

00:35.230 --> 00:37.323
how to unlock them
before we put them on.

00:37.370 --> 00:40.396
The purpose of this exercise
is to simulate field conditions.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.533
If we were kidnapped,
do you think our captors

00:42.570 --> 00:45.698
would allow us a dry run
with our restraints?

00:45.740 --> 00:47.435
(clack)
Oh.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.675
(clicks tongue)
Almost had it.

00:49.710 --> 00:52.816
Unlike hand grenades, handcuffs
do not reward nearness.

00:52.850 --> 00:55.410
RINGTONE: * Hello, hello!
Bonjour, bonjour! *

00:55.450 --> 00:56.815
* Bonjour, bonjour!

00:56.850 --> 00:59.489
* Hola, hola! Hola, hola!

00:59.520 --> 01:01.385
You're still using
that ringtone?

01:01.420 --> 01:04.184
You still haven't cracked _
my new passcode to change It?

01:04.230 --> 01:06.551
* Hello, hello!
Bonjour, bonjour! *

01:06.600 --> 01:08.795
* Bonjour, bonjour!
Hola, hola! *

01:08.830 --> 01:10.491
It's Stuyvesant
Memorial Hospital,

01:10.530 --> 01:12.088
your former place of employ.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.664
(ringtone stops)

01:13.700 --> 01:15.463
(clacking)

01:15.500 --> 01:17.468
(electronic chime)

01:17.510 --> 01:19.774
(light clacking)

01:19.810 --> 01:21.732
If you'd like,
I could play you the voice mail.

01:21.780 --> 01:24.476
I'll just put it on speaker
phone-- what's your passcode?

01:24.510 --> 01:26.410
I got it. Thanks.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.156
This is her.

01:32.190 --> 01:33.487
Abby Campbell.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.784
She's a lab tech
at our fertility clinic.

01:35.820 --> 01:37.788
The night before last,
she told a colleague

01:37.830 --> 01:39.525
she was planning
to work late.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.494
Her husband--
he's a doctor here--

01:41.530 --> 01:43.418
he says she never came home.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.392
Her car's still
in the parking garage,

01:45.430 --> 01:47.534
but no one's been able
to locate her.

01:47.570 --> 01:49.231
You called the police?

01:49.270 --> 01:51.636
They've already been here.
They're looking into it.

01:51.670 --> 01:53.706
But then I thought of you,
and I figured

01:53.740 --> 01:55.628
since we have a_detective
In the family...

01:55.680 --> 01:59.468
Is it possible she left
without telling anyone?

01:59.520 --> 02:02.409
She has a two-year-old daughter.
I can't imagine her

02:02.450 --> 02:04.145
leaving her behind.

02:04.190 --> 02:07.387
She's a good person,
stable, respectable.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.729
Respectable people have been
known to uproot themselves

02:09.760 --> 02:12.490
without any warning.
All I can tell you is

02:12.530 --> 02:14.395
it would be out of character,

02:14.430 --> 02:16.864
and that a lot of people
care about her.

02:16.900 --> 02:19.289
So what do you think?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.331
Can you help?

02:22.940 --> 02:24.760
(door closes)

02:32.650 --> 02:35.574
This is her workstation.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.418
Where she spent her days looking
at life through a microscope.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.951
And nights.

02:39.990 --> 02:41.457
No one seems surprised

02:41.490 --> 02:43.458
that Abby was planning
to work late.

02:43.490 --> 02:45.287
The rise

02:45.330 --> 02:47.890
in the breeding age
of the average American female

02:47.930 --> 02:50.296
has led to a great increase

02:50.330 --> 02:52.469
in the demand
for fertility specialists.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.968
You'd think given the sensitive
nature of this facility,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.833
there would be security cameras,
wouldn't you?
Surveillance

02:57.870 --> 03:00.430
in the hospital's lab wing
has always been pretty light.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.449
She could have
slipped out unnoticed.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.278
(electronic clinging)
Or someone else
could have slipped in.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.712
What is it?

03:15.760 --> 03:18.558
It's Emily--
she says she needs
to talk, it's urgent.

03:18.590 --> 03:20.455
Did your entire social network
choose today

03:20.500 --> 03:22.991
to have some sort of crisis,
or is this somehow related

03:23.030 --> 03:24.691
to your former administrator's
request for help.

03:24.730 --> 03:27.233
No, Emily and Tamara
didn't know each other.

03:27.270 --> 03:28.692
Emily wants
to meet up.

03:28.740 --> 03:30.958
She says she needs
to talk in person.

03:31.970 --> 03:33.870
(exhales)

03:33.910 --> 03:36.504
Did you find something?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.677
Abby's workstation,
and only Abby's,

03:38.710 --> 03:41.941
has been very recently
and very thoroughly cleaned.

03:41.980 --> 03:44.312
Maybe she tidied up
before she left.

03:44.350 --> 03:47.285
Maybe there was
a violent struggle here...

03:47.320 --> 03:49.959
followed
by a thorough scrubbing.

04:07.740 --> 04:10.379
Do you think Abby Campbell
and her fellow techs

04:10.410 --> 04:12.640
would be in the habit
of wheeling samples

04:12.680 --> 04:14.614
to and from this area
on gurneys?

04:14.650 --> 04:16.481
You almost never
see gurneys

04:16.520 --> 04:17.680
in this part of the hospital--

04:17.720 --> 04:19.779
it's all labs__ _
and support faCIIItIes.

04:19.820 --> 04:22.653
Yet there's evidence that one
was used here qUIte recently.

04:22.690 --> 04:25.784
Had a sticlq wheel,
left scuff marks every few feet.

04:25.830 --> 04:29.698
That's one way someone could
have gotten Abby out of here.

04:29.730 --> 04:32.836
They continue into the corridor.
Let's track them.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.674
Trail ends here.

04:47.950 --> 04:50.510
You familiar
with this room?

04:50.550 --> 04:52.916
No, I've never been
down here before.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.588
Not exactly a surgical
suite, is it?

04:57.430 --> 04:59.557
Actually, I think it is.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.726
Sort of.

05:00.760 --> 05:03.695
This is _
an ultrasonic aspirator.

05:07.670 --> 05:09.865
These are human organs.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.099
More human organs.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.506
This is a prep lab
for medical specimens.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.006
They take donor corpses

05:18.050 --> 05:20.109
_ and turn them _
Into teaching materials

05:20.150 --> 05:22.414
for med schools.
This would have been

05:22.450 --> 05:24.645
a great place
to dispose of a body.

05:28.990 --> 05:30.685
Abby Campbell's dead.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.550
I'm just saying
it's a possibility.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.558
No. It is a certainty.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.065
Note the chip in
her left maxillary

05:46.110 --> 05:48.977
central incisor.

05:49.010 --> 05:53.470
Note the chip in her
left maxillary central incisor.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.046
Hello, Abby Campbell.

05:59.620 --> 06:03.078
*

06:35.090 --> 06:39.129
Dental records conﬁrm it--
this is Abby Campbell.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.492
Or at least what's left of her.

06:41.530 --> 06:43.566
Doubt we'll find
much more.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.465
The culprit likely used
the pressure oven

06:45.500 --> 06:48.765
Watson identified at the scene
to burn away the other remains.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.028
Why leave

06:50.070 --> 06:51.503
the skeleton?

06:51.540 --> 06:52.837
I'll wager...

06:52.880 --> 06:54.734
from its car_eful
reconstruction,

06:54.780 --> 06:57.476
they wanted it to end up
in a lab somewhere.

06:57.510 --> 06:58.772
(sighs)

06:58.810 --> 07:00.971
Well, any way you slice it--

07:01.020 --> 07:03.989
pun definitely not intended--
whoever did this

07:04.020 --> 07:05.908
is a nasty
piece of work.

07:05.950 --> 07:08.157
He didn't just kill her,
he took her apart.

07:08.190 --> 07:10.522
Nasty and skilled.

07:11.960 --> 07:16.056
Stripping and then reassembling
Mrs. Campbell overnight

07:16.100 --> 07:19.069
would have taken _
a certain amount of expertise.

07:19.100 --> 07:23.104
We're looking at a doctor
or a nurse or...

07:23.140 --> 07:26.029
pretty much any one
of a_ thousand other
medical professronals

07:26.070 --> 07:28.129
who work at
that hospital.
Or someone who works

07:28.180 --> 07:30.171
for _one of its _
many assoaated laboratories,

07:30.210 --> 07:32.917
private practices
and specialty clinics.

07:32.950 --> 07:34.542
(exhales)
You said on the phone

07:34.580 --> 07:36.138
you thought she was
choked to death?

07:36.180 --> 07:39.013
There is _ _
exactly one bone missmg

07:39.050 --> 07:42.679
from this macabre display--
the hyoid.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.584
Should sit right here.
Now, since the hyoid

07:44.630 --> 07:46.029
is known to break

07:46.060 --> 07:48.893
in one-third of all
homicides by strangulation...

07:48.930 --> 07:51.626
You think the killer got rid
of it to cover his tracks.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.137
Perhaps he thought
a broken hyoid

07:53.170 --> 07:54.967
was more suspicious
than an absent one.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.230
Now, assuming
Abby Campbell was strangled

07:57.270 --> 08:00.034
at her workstation--
and since that workstation faced

08:00.080 --> 08:01.968
the only entrance
to the laboratory...

08:02.010 --> 08:04.774
Stands to reason he
didn't sneak up on her.

08:04.810 --> 08:06.072
She knew him.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.749
Did I mention
her husband is a doctor?

08:15.160 --> 08:17.549
MAN: cranberry muffin
for Terry!

08:17.590 --> 08:18.989
Hey!

08:21.000 --> 08:22.058
Hi.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.988
Hi. Thanks for coming.

08:24.030 --> 08:25.566
You said it was urgent.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.795
It is. Or at least
I think it is.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.899
What, you don't know
if it's urgent or not?

08:29.940 --> 08:31.305
Honestly, I'm
not even sure

08:31.340 --> 08:33.638
if I'm supposed to be
talking about this.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.170
About what?

08:35.210 --> 08:37.144
A police detective

08:37.180 --> 08:38.545
came to my house
this morning.

08:38.580 --> 08:40.172
She said_she had some
questions for me,

08:40.220 --> 08:42.142
so I figured, okay.

08:42.180 --> 08:45.581
Then I let her in, and all
her questions were about you.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.281
Did she tell you her name?

08:47.320 --> 08:49.015
Yeah, she left
her card.

08:49.060 --> 08:51.187
Gina Cortes.

08:52.860 --> 08:54.657
Here.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.668
Burglary Division,

08:56.700 --> 08:58.122
Coney Island.
Do you know her?

08:58.170 --> 09:01.594
No. What did she want to know.
It was weird.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.108
It was personal stuff,
like how we met,

09:04.140 --> 09:06.779
how often we get together.
She asked if I thought

09:06.810 --> 09:09.233
you were the kind of person
who would break the law.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.748
What?
I know.

09:11.780 --> 09:14.271
Well, did she say
she was working a case?

09:14.320 --> 09:17.084
No. When I asked why she
was asking about you,

09:17.120 --> 09:19.543
she said she wasn't at
liberty to discuss it.

09:21.290 --> 09:23.679
Joanie...

09:23.730 --> 09:25.220
are you in some
sort of trouble?

09:25.260 --> 09:27.319
No, of course not.
'Cause if you are,

09:27.360 --> 09:29.920
you know you can
tell me, right?
Emily,

09:29.970 --> 09:32.325
obviously there's been
some sort of misunderstanding.

09:33.670 --> 09:35.797
I'll look into it.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.865
SHERLOCK: Dr. Campbell,
just for the record,

09:37.910 --> 09:41.038
you are an oncologist
at Stuyvesant Memorial?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.640
(sighs)
Yeah.
That where

09:43.680 --> 09:44.999
you and Abby met?

09:45.050 --> 09:46.301
We didn't
work together.

09:46.350 --> 09:47.271
Uh, not directly.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.242
My clinic is technically
a private practice.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.283
We met at a party.
Mutual friends.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.015
How long have you
been together?

09:54.060 --> 09:55.254
Five years.

09:55.290 --> 09:58.782
Uh... married for three.

09:58.830 --> 10:01.754
You_r call_us_es are...
qUIte distinctive.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.893
You a rock climber?

10:04.970 --> 10:06.665
Uh... Abby got me into it.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.292
I mostly climb at the gym.

10:08.340 --> 10:10.934
I imagine you've got
formidable grip strength.

10:10.970 --> 10:13.279
BELL: You're strong enough
to have overpowered Abby,

10:13.310 --> 10:15.005
you've got
the medical knowledge to...

10:15.040 --> 10:17.645
reduce her to a skeleton--
we have to ask.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.046
Did I kill my wife?

10:20.080 --> 10:21.638
No.

10:23.220 --> 10:26.314
I understand
you guys have to ask...

10:26.350 --> 10:27.851
but...

10:27.890 --> 10:30.120
The night that
Abby disappeared,

10:30.160 --> 10:32.651
I was going over the books
with my clinic manager.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.327
Now, she can tell you
when I left,

10:34.360 --> 10:36.794
but I remember
it was late.

10:36.830 --> 10:38.821
And why didn't you
report Abby missing

10:38.870 --> 10:41.134
when you came home,
realized she wasn't there?

10:41.170 --> 10:43.968
Abby's clinic is understaffed;
she works long hours.

10:44.010 --> 10:46.205
She told the nanny
to look after her daughter

10:46.240 --> 10:48.037
until I got home.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.229
I got home.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.907
I just...
I went to bed.

10:50.950 --> 10:55.341
Would you describe your marriage
as a happy one?

10:55.380 --> 10:57.189
Lately?

10:57.220 --> 10:58.744
No.

10:58.790 --> 11:00.212
Quite the contrary.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.455
You two weren't
getting along?

11:02.490 --> 11:07.450
Abby and I were more in love
than we ever were.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.924
Our marriage wasn't happy
because she was dying.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.268
She_ had
pancreatic cancer,

11:13.300 --> 11:15.461
stage IV.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.400
She didn't want anyone to know.

11:17.440 --> 11:21.001
I was giving her chemo,
but the truth is...

11:21.040 --> 11:24.840
(sighs)
there was no hope.

11:24.880 --> 11:28.179
She probably only had
a year to live.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.484
You can ask
my nursmg staff.

11:30.520 --> 11:34.012
The people at my clinic,
they'll tell you.

11:34.060 --> 11:37.325
I was doing everything I could
to save Abby's life.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.954
I wouldn't
have killed her.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.720
The cancer was doing that
all by itself.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.164
* So fast, I want time to fly,
fun, fun *

11:49.200 --> 11:52.169
* Think about fun,
you know what it is *

11:52.210 --> 11:55.771
* I got this, you got this,
my friend is by my right, hey *

11:55.810 --> 11:58.244
Sherlock?!
* I got this, you got this

11:58.280 --> 12:00.771
* Now you know it

12:00.820 --> 12:04.745
* Kickin' in the front seat,
sittin' in the backseat *

12:04.790 --> 12:06.189
What are you doing?

12:06.220 --> 12:08.313
Hospital's security cameras
had no sound.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.783
So I was providing
a musical score in order

12:10.830 --> 12:12.889
to make the tedious comings
and goings of the employees

12:12.930 --> 12:14.295
more engaging.

12:14.330 --> 12:16.355
You chose a ringtone
you knew I would dislike.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.119
So I thought
I would fight fire with fire.

12:19.170 --> 12:21.968
"Friday"? Seriously?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.230
(music stops)
There's also a song that appeals
to me as a detective.

12:24.270 --> 12:27.273
It's a mystery about dogs
and who may have let them out.

12:27.310 --> 12:29.870
So did you find anything?

12:29.910 --> 12:31.446
There's
preCIous little

12:31.480 --> 12:34.449
on Abby Campbell the night
of her disappearance.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.344
A trip to the cafeteria.
A return

12:35.380 --> 12:37.280
in the general direction
of her workplace.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.344
And then nothing.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.948
These are all
from different days?

12:39.990 --> 12:42.515
I tracked down
all available video of her

12:42.560 --> 12:44.551
in the weeks leading up
to her murder.

12:44.590 --> 12:46.455
I was hoping to isolate
any contentious encounters

12:46.490 --> 12:49.220
she may have had
with her coworkers.
And?

12:49.260 --> 12:51.069
It appears
she was very, very well-liked.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.965
No unpleasantness whatsoever.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.004
There was, however,
some suspicious pleasantness.

13:00.140 --> 13:02.847
They look intimate.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.542
Using hospital employee records,
I was able to identify that man

13:05.580 --> 13:08.447
as Dr. Branford Fisher,
a surgical resident.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.813
Dr. Fisher and Abby have no
professional reason to interact.

13:11.850 --> 13:15.217
Their areas of expertise
have no overlap. I have,

13:15.260 --> 13:18.423
however, observed no less
than 12 meetings between them.

13:18.460 --> 13:22.089
And all in out-of—the-way
corners of the hospital.

13:22.130 --> 13:25.099
That is a disused patient room.

13:25.130 --> 13:28.338
They spend approximately
15 minutes in there together,

13:28.370 --> 13:32.204
and then they emerged
looking rumpled and happy.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.401
Abby was having an affair.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.431
Dr. Fisher
called in sick

13:36.480 --> 13:37.845
the morning
she was reported missing.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.347
I've attempted to contact him,

13:39.380 --> 13:40.176
but he's not answering
his phone.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.915
And the only listed address
for him

13:41.950 --> 13:43.542
is a PO box.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.445
All rather suspicious.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.381
How went your
meeting with Emily?

13:50.430 --> 13:53.194
Not great, actually.

13:53.230 --> 13:54.857
Can you think of any reason
why the police

13:54.900 --> 13:56.322
would be investigating me?

13:59.570 --> 14:01.936
You said Emily was not
your only friend contacted

14:01.970 --> 14:04.006
by Detective Cortes.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.201
Yeah, I got calls
from two other people today.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.435
The detective
asked them

14:08.480 --> 14:09.629
the same kinds of questions.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.341
What kind of person am I,

14:11.380 --> 14:13.519
would I ever break the law.

14:13.550 --> 14:15.518
But she never outright accused
you of anything.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.485
No.
Have you,
Watson,

14:18.520 --> 14:20.511
ever committed any burglaries
in Coney Island?

14:22.090 --> 14:23.284
Have to ask.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.479
No, I have not committed

14:24.530 --> 14:25.883
any burglaries in Coney Island.

14:25.930 --> 14:27.158
I can't even remember
the last time

14:27.200 --> 14:28.553
I was in that part of the city.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.023
You have to talk
to this woman.
You think?

14:31.070 --> 14:32.492
The timing of her investigation
is unfortunate,

14:32.530 --> 14:34.896
to say the least. We've
only just returned to the NYPD,

14:34.940 --> 14:36.498
so the last thing we need
are rumors

14:36.540 --> 14:37.529
that we've engaged
in some kind of thievery.

14:37.570 --> 14:40.004
I will handle it. Okay?

14:40.040 --> 14:42.429
(phone ringing)

14:44.210 --> 14:45.575
Hello?

14:45.610 --> 14:48.078
Mr. Holmes?
This is Nate Campbell.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.089
How'd you get this number,
Dr. Campbell?

14:51.120 --> 14:52.348
I understand
you're looking for a doctor

14:52.390 --> 14:53.652
from Stuyvesant Memorial.

14:53.690 --> 14:55.908
Branford Fisher.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.257
Iam.

14:57.290 --> 14:58.552
I can tell you where he is.

14:58.590 --> 15:00.194
But only in person.

15:00.230 --> 15:02.391
And you can't bring the police.

15:02.430 --> 15:04.125
(doorbell rings)

15:04.170 --> 15:06.593
(crickets chirping)

15:08.140 --> 15:10.108
We came alone,
as per your request.

15:11.470 --> 15:13.438
on the off chance
you intend to do us harm.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.677
No. Nothing like that.
Please, come in.

15:22.180 --> 15:25.445
So, you told us
you could help us find...

15:25.490 --> 15:27.151
Dr. Fisher.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.418
Someone needs
to tell us

15:28.460 --> 15:30.428
what's going on
right now.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.257
When you left your message,
I got nervous.

15:32.290 --> 15:33.951
I called Nate.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.423
Because...

15:36.460 --> 15:37.461
It's complicated.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.594
Branford never
would have hurt Abby.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.596
Did you know
they were having an affair?

15:42.640 --> 15:44.608
HOLMES:
No, it wasn't
an affair, was it?

15:44.640 --> 15:46.608
Dr. Fisher's a size 12.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.676
Dr. Campbell's a size nine.
There's a pair of size 12

15:48.710 --> 15:50.644
running shoes here by the door.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.045
There's also a photograph
of Dr. Fisher receiving

15:52.080 --> 15:54.674
a commendation on the wall.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.369
He lives here.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.684
On the phone,
you said this was your house.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.985
It's their house.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.419
They were both married to Abby.

16:03.460 --> 16:05.223
Or is there another explanation
for your matching

16:05.260 --> 16:06.750
wedding bands?

16:06.790 --> 16:08.724
I think the current slang
for such an arrangement

16:08.760 --> 16:10.159
is a "thruple."

16:10.200 --> 16:12.020
Three people, one marriage.

16:12.070 --> 16:15.289
You were both married
to Abby at the same time.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.137
We were. But I swear to you,

16:17.170 --> 16:20.537
neither of us killed
our Wife.

16:27.150 --> 16:29.038
We had to keep our
marriage secret.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.616
We have a two-year-old
daughter, Chloe.

16:30.650 --> 16:34.211
If we got reported to Family
Services, we could lose her.

16:34.260 --> 16:38.754
Not to mention _our careers.
Hospitals don't like scandals.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.758
You all look
very happy together.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.654
NATE:
We are.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.190
We were.

16:44.230 --> 16:46.323
We're just... a family.

16:46.370 --> 16:48.531
We're no different
than anyone else.

16:48.570 --> 16:50.333
Can you account
for your whereabouts

16:50.370 --> 16:51.598
the night Abby disappeared?

16:51.640 --> 16:53.335
FISHER:
I was in Boston.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.530
My dad's been sick.
I went up to see him.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.400
But I also caught up
with some friends.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.645
They'll all tell
you I was there.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.240
If you don't mind me asking,
how did this...

17:02.280 --> 17:04.339
arrangement come about?

17:04.390 --> 17:06.381
NATE:
Branford and
I were, uh,

17:06.420 --> 17:09.389
together first.
But we had an understanding.

17:09.420 --> 17:13.049
Uh, and as I said,
I met Abby at a party.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.455
It grew
from there.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.297
She was okay joining you?

17:17.330 --> 17:20.231
It was her idea, actually.
She'd done it before.

17:20.270 --> 17:22.329
She was in _
another group marriage?

17:22.370 --> 17:25.305
Arrangements like ours happen
more often than people think.

17:25.340 --> 17:28.104
For some people,
it just works.

17:28.140 --> 17:29.573
It worked for Abby.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.441
Mostly.

17:31.480 --> 17:34.244
Her last marriage was a bad one?

17:34.280 --> 17:35.577
FISHER:
It ended badly.

17:35.620 --> 17:39.340
She had a falling-out with
one of her fellow wives.

17:39.390 --> 17:41.381
She hinted it
got violent once.

17:41.420 --> 17:43.354
NATE:
There was
a dispute.

17:43.390 --> 17:45.324
Over money, community assets.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.384
And she was still fighting it,

17:46.430 --> 17:48.796
years after.
You said

17:48.830 --> 17:51.264
"one of her fellow wives."
How many people were involved

17:51.300 --> 17:52.619
in her previous marriage?

17:52.670 --> 17:55.639
Not counting Abby? Five.

17:57.470 --> 18:00.405
GREGSON:
Abby Campbell's exes.
All five of them.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.101
They're still married.

18:02.140 --> 18:05.644
They live in some big house
out in West Essex County.

18:05.680 --> 18:10.117
I had to send five
different cars to get them.

18:10.150 --> 18:12.448
All the suspects
we could hope for.

18:12.490 --> 18:14.287
I don't know how they do it.

18:14.320 --> 18:17.153
I couldn't make a marriage
to one person work.

18:17.190 --> 18:18.088
But Americans
have experimented

18:18.130 --> 18:20.519
with every possible variation
of matrimony.

18:20.560 --> 18:23.324
From the adelphic polygyny
of the Omaha tribe

18:23.370 --> 18:25.691
to the patriarchal polygamy
of the early Mormons

18:25.730 --> 18:27.630
to the free love hippy communes
of the 1970s.

18:27.670 --> 18:29.467
And while some
of those experiments

18:29.500 --> 18:32.469
were abject failures,
many were remarkably long-lived.

18:32.510 --> 18:34.330
Yeah, well, this
experiment ended badly,

18:34.380 --> 18:36.302
at least for
Abby Campbell.

18:36.340 --> 18:39.309
Maybe bad enough
to get her killed.

18:39.350 --> 18:42.342
They're here,
but they're not happy.

18:42.380 --> 18:43.449
I assume
you've kept them separate

18:43.490 --> 18:45.446
so they can't coordinate
their stories?

18:45.490 --> 18:49.381
Yeah. Like five married people
could ever agree on anything.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.890
Abby was special.
We all loved her.

18:54.930 --> 18:57.398
Everything was great.
The first year or two.

18:57.430 --> 18:59.466
I got nothing to say to you.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.333
EX-WIFE 1:
But you have to understand,
Abby was...

19:02.370 --> 19:05.305
stubborn.

19:05.340 --> 19:06.534
I'm supposed to be coaching
my daughter's

19:06.570 --> 19:07.935
soccer team this afternoon.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.777
Do I really need
to be here?

19:09.810 --> 19:11.778
It was really all about money.
Abby worked hard.

19:11.810 --> 19:13.448
She wanted to keep
what she earned.

19:13.480 --> 19:16.608
But Denise insisted
we all pool our money.

19:16.650 --> 19:18.880
We're registered
as two married couples.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.888
We share a house to save money.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.410
Trish is our nanny.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.451
The nanny?

19:24.490 --> 19:26.424
Yeah. Sure.

19:26.460 --> 19:27.722
I'm the nanny.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.648
EX-HUSBAND 1:
It got a little ugly.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.464
Especially when it came time
to buy the house.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.492
The house thing.
That was when it all went bad.

19:35.540 --> 19:39.806
Abby had this inheritance, and
Denise pressured her to use it

19:39.840 --> 19:41.569
as a down payment. Abby agreed,

19:41.610 --> 19:44.545
but she was never really happy
about it.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.502
We have six kids.
Everybody's got to pitch in.

19:46.550 --> 19:47.539
It doesn't matter

19:47.580 --> 19:49.445
if they have
a job or not.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.981
I don't got to talk to you
about any of this.

19:51.020 --> 19:52.510
Unless you're charging me
with something.

19:52.550 --> 19:53.778
EX-WIFE 1:
The arguments

19:53.820 --> 19:55.981
just got worse and worse.

19:56.020 --> 19:59.581
And it didn't help that Abby
was so much younger than Denise

19:59.630 --> 20:01.951
and maybe... got a little more

20:02.000 --> 20:03.763
_ attention
when it came to, you know,

20:03.800 --> 20:06.598
sleeping arrangements.
EX-HUSBAND 1:
There was

20:06.630 --> 20:07.995
a little pushing and shoving
between her

20:08.040 --> 20:09.996
and Denise toward the end.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.463
EX-WIFE 1:
I think that was
the last straw.

20:12.510 --> 20:15.934
The next day,
she just... left.

20:15.980 --> 20:18.471
She'd been trying to get that
down payment back ever since.

20:18.510 --> 20:21.240
But giving it to her would've
meant selling the house.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.919
Denise said that was out
of the question.

20:23.950 --> 20:26.544
You want to know what happened,
talk to Denise.

20:26.590 --> 20:27.955
I don't know.

20:27.990 --> 20:30.288
That was between her and Denise.

20:30.330 --> 20:33.026
This is harassment,
plain and simple.

20:33.060 --> 20:34.925
And if the NYPD
causes me

20:34.960 --> 20:37.929
or my family any embarrassment,

20:37.970 --> 20:40.359
I will sue this department
in general

20:40.400 --> 20:42.038
and you three in particular.

20:42.070 --> 20:44.038
It says here your specialty
is contract law.

20:44.070 --> 20:46.607
Didn't know_
you were also a litigator.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.005
A lawyer is a lawyer.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.838
You want to test me,
I'll see you in court.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.269
Look, no one's going to court,
Denise. Not if you want

20:53.320 --> 20:54.571
your private life
to stay private.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.269
Now, if you cooperate, you

20:56.320 --> 20:58.743
and your family can go back
home to Essex, no problem.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.350
You make a stink, you're
gonna end up in the press.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.358
GREGSON:
Seven years after Abby
left the marriage,

21:03.390 --> 21:06.052
you and her were still fighting
over her share of the house.

21:06.090 --> 21:10.299
She fronted $100,000
for your down.

21:10.330 --> 21:12.321
You never paid her back.

21:12.370 --> 21:13.769
Like she needed the money.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.394
She married an oncologist.
He's rolling in it.

21:18.570 --> 21:22.006
Okay, things were bad

21:22.040 --> 21:24.645
between Abby and me, but then...

21:24.680 --> 21:26.648
we had lunch a few weeks ago.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.944
We buried the hatchet.
It was her idea.

21:28.980 --> 21:31.949
She was diagnosed with cancer
and wanted closure.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.355
No loose ends.

21:35.390 --> 21:36.379
Here.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.389
She e-mailed me this

21:39.430 --> 21:42.797
after she signed it.

21:42.830 --> 21:44.468
_ I_ have
the original at home.

21:44.500 --> 21:47.469
It's a quitclaim giving up
her interest in the house.

21:47.500 --> 21:50.367
So you see,
I had no reason to hurt Abby.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.560
Not that I ever would have.
I loved her.

21:52.610 --> 21:54.407
Once.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.648
Now, are we done?

21:57.680 --> 22:00.046
Uh, I'm sorry.

22:00.080 --> 22:03.846
Did-did she want anything in
return for this peace offering?

22:07.120 --> 22:09.953
BELL:
Denise?

22:09.990 --> 22:12.629
Yes, she asked for something,
but I couldn't give it to her.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.628
She wanted me
to draw up

22:14.660 --> 22:16.799
a confidentiality
agreement.

22:16.830 --> 22:20.061
She was trying to sell something
and she wanted a guarantee

22:20.100 --> 22:23.661
that the buyer wouldn't reveal
the nature of the transaction.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.007
What was she selling?

22:25.040 --> 22:26.837
I don't know.

22:26.870 --> 22:30.078
But I got the sense it was
something that she'd stolen.

22:30.110 --> 22:32.806
When I explained to her
that any contract that pertains

22:32.850 --> 22:35.114
to illegal activity
is null and void...

22:35.150 --> 22:36.947
she dropped it.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.414
But I don't know.

22:39.450 --> 22:41.509
Whatever she took,

22:41.560 --> 22:43.858
maybe it was worth killing over.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.764
Detective Cortes.
Joan Watson.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.028
But I'm guessing you
knew that already.

23:00.070 --> 23:01.879
How can I help you, Ms. Watson?

23:01.910 --> 23:03.775
Actually, I was wondering
ifI could help you.

23:03.810 --> 23:05.072
You've been asking
questions about me.

23:05.110 --> 23:06.873
I thought we could sit
down, talk face-to-face,

23:06.910 --> 23:08.844
clear up any
misunderstanding.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.610
That's very thoughtful of you,
but now's not a good time.

23:11.650 --> 23:12.912
When would be
a good time?

23:12.950 --> 23:15.009
I don't know.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.949
But when I'm ready to talk
to you, I'll find you. Trust me.

23:17.990 --> 23:21.096
Can you at least tell me
what you think I did?

23:21.130 --> 23:23.018
I never said
you did anything.

23:23.060 --> 23:25.096
Are you planning to talk
to more people I know?

23:25.130 --> 23:27.633
Does that make you
uncomfortable?

23:27.670 --> 23:30.730
Having someone poke around
in your life, ask questions?

23:30.770 --> 23:34.672
It's not like you have
anything to hide, right?

23:38.810 --> 23:41.040
(door opens)

23:41.080 --> 23:43.116
Just gonna
text you.

23:43.150 --> 23:44.811
Still a free woman,
I see.

23:44.850 --> 23:46.738
May I assume you've
cleared up any confusion

23:46.790 --> 23:48.109
with Detective Cortes?

23:48.160 --> 23:50.082
No, you may not.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.953
I caught her as she was leaving
her precinct. I told her

23:52.990 --> 23:55.151
I would be happy to answer
any questions she might have.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.019
She said she didn't have any.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.119
So I asked her, "Can
you at least tell me

23:58.170 --> 24:00.730
what crime I'm supposed to have
committed?" She said no.

24:00.770 --> 24:02.067
Well, it's not unusual
for a police detective

24:02.100 --> 24:03.965
to be cagey with a suspect.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.739
Well that's the thing--
I don't think I'm a suspect.

24:05.770 --> 24:07.476
I think it's personal.
She's messing with me.

24:07.510 --> 24:08.829
You said before yesterday
you'd never even

24:08.880 --> 24:10.177
heard of Detective Cortes.

24:10.210 --> 24:11.973
Mm, I hadn't.

24:12.010 --> 24:13.546
Perhaps at some point you slept
with one of her lovers.

24:13.580 --> 24:15.548
Well, considering
she's gay and I'm not,

24:15.580 --> 24:17.047
I think that's highly unlikely.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.241
Ah, so you've been
looking into her.

24:19.290 --> 24:21.679
What choice do I have? She won't
tell me what her problem is,

24:21.720 --> 24:24.154
so I have to find out myself.

24:24.190 --> 24:25.179
What is all this?

24:25.230 --> 24:27.152
Inventory forms,
personnel records

24:27.190 --> 24:29.249
and security reports
from Stuyvesant Memorial.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.597
One of Abby Campbell's
ex-spouses

24:30.630 --> 24:32.063
seems to think she was trying

24:32.100 --> 24:34.261
to sell something
that she had stolen.

24:34.300 --> 24:36.996
Whatever it was, you're thinking
it came from the hospital.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.258
She would have had access
to any number of valuable items.

24:39.310 --> 24:41.198
Drugs. They are, of course,
the most common target

24:41.240 --> 24:42.878
for medical larceny.

24:42.910 --> 24:44.775
But all of the hospital's
inventories add up.

24:44.810 --> 24:47.244
Nothing is missing
from any of the pharmacies.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.578
All of the equipment in Abby's
lab is also accounted for,

24:49.620 --> 24:50.848
except for some
inexpensive items

24:50.890 --> 24:52.187
like test tubes and beakers.

24:52.220 --> 24:54.051
Glassware goes missing
all the time.

24:54.090 --> 24:56.615
Interns and nurses use them
as tumblers and shot glasses.

24:56.660 --> 24:58.924
I noticed the suture scissors
in your sewmg kit.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.222
Anyway,
it occurred to me

25:00.260 --> 25:02.251
there was something else
she could have taken.

25:02.300 --> 25:03.961
Something she would have
had ready access to

25:04.000 --> 25:06.025
as an employee
of the fertility clinic.

25:06.070 --> 25:09.096
Something that is in
extremely high demand.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.199
Viable human embryos.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.662
_ Would've been _
a Simple matter to pilfer

25:12.710 --> 25:15.804
excess blastocysts
intended for disposal.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.102
A single fertilized egg
can go for

25:17.140 --> 25:19.108
up to $10,000
on the open market.

25:19.150 --> 25:22.039
I don't think Abby's eggs would
have made it to the open market.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.843
If she was looking
for a motivated buyer,

25:23.890 --> 25:25.312
she needn't
have looked any further

25:25.350 --> 25:28.057
than her own social circle.

25:29.660 --> 25:31.218
Dr. Amrit.

25:31.260 --> 25:33.285
Sherlock Holmes.
This is Joan Watson.

25:33.330 --> 25:35.821
We work with
the New York police department.

25:35.860 --> 25:38.567
You went to college
with Abby Campbell,

25:38.600 --> 25:40.227
did you not?
Uh, excuse me?

25:40.270 --> 25:42.295
The two of you remained friends
unﬁlhen"

25:42.340 --> 25:45.036
her recent demise.
Posted your condolences

25:45.070 --> 25:46.662
just this morning
on social media.

25:46.710 --> 25:48.632
So?

25:48.680 --> 25:50.705
You use embryonic stem cells
in your research, right?

25:50.750 --> 25:53.571
Abby reposted an article
you wrote a few months ago.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.269
In it, you argue that
researchers should have

25:55.320 --> 25:57.880
unfettered access
to embryos that are destroyed

25:57.920 --> 26:00.184
by IVF clinics in the course
of their work.

26:00.220 --> 26:03.314
Embryonic stem cell research
is the most promising path

26:03.360 --> 26:06.921
to finding a cure for diabetes
and other metabolic diseases.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.622
But why that would be
of interest to the police, uh...

26:09.660 --> 26:12.265
Must be frustrating when
politicians pander to their base

26:12.300 --> 26:14.666
by making it difficult
to obtain suitable cells.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.634
Enough to purchase

26:16.670 --> 26:18.763
excess embryos from Abby.

26:18.810 --> 26:21.005
I have papers
to grade.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.008
It is, of course,
illegal to obtain embryos

26:23.040 --> 26:25.372
without the _consent
of the potential parent

26:25.410 --> 26:27.640
that provided
that genetic material.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.648
We can get a warrant.
If the DNA of the cells

26:29.680 --> 26:31.819
from your lab match the patients
from Abby's clinic,

26:31.850 --> 26:33.078
then that's a federal crime.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.987
I'm trying to save lives.

26:36.020 --> 26:39.285
Diabetes is a plague. It kills
over four million people a year.

26:39.330 --> 26:42.652
How many embryos did you agree
to buy from Abby? A few dozen?

26:42.700 --> 26:45.260
That would have cost hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.359
As far as we know,
you never paid her a dime.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.095
Did you kill your old friend

26:49.140 --> 26:50.767
so that you wouldn't
have to compensate her?

26:50.810 --> 26:53.870
I didn't hurt Abby.

26:53.910 --> 26:55.775
And she didn't want money.

26:55.810 --> 26:57.277
It was a trade.

26:57.310 --> 26:58.800
A trade for what?

26:58.850 --> 27:02.308
She came to me asking
for access to my lab.

27:02.350 --> 27:04.011
She wanted to run
some blood tests

27:04.050 --> 27:05.312
after hours and
off the record.

27:05.350 --> 27:08.649
I asked for the embryos
in return.

27:08.690 --> 27:10.783
They would have just
been thrown away.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.287
Wasted.
What was she
testing the blood for?

27:13.330 --> 27:14.797
She wouldn't tell me.

27:14.830 --> 27:17.321
She would have used
computerized equipment.

27:17.360 --> 27:20.124
There might be records of her
tests on their hard drives.

27:20.170 --> 27:22.365
Do you mind if we have a look?
No.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.334
I do not.
I just don't

27:24.370 --> 27:26.338
think you're going to find much.

27:26.370 --> 27:30.875
I thought it was some religious
fanatic opposed to my research.

27:30.910 --> 27:34.368
I get threatening letters
and e-mails-- very nasty.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.945
But then I heard
about Abby, and...

27:40.120 --> 27:43.112
Blood chemistry analyzer.

27:43.160 --> 27:45.048
The flow cytomer.

27:45.090 --> 27:47.058
Everything she might have
used to test blood.

27:47.090 --> 27:48.751
Whatever she was
d0ing here,

27:48.800 --> 27:51.724
someon_e wanted to
keep it a secret.

27:57.770 --> 27:59.829
So Abby Campbell runs
some hush-hush blood tests.

27:59.870 --> 28:02.407
Someone isn't happy
about that.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.442
He or she kills her,

28:04.480 --> 28:07.449
takes her apart,
and then the next night

28:07.480 --> 28:11.746
goes to the lab she used
and destroys all of her data.

28:11.790 --> 28:14.315
Whoever set the fires
didn't just burn those machines.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.749
The hard drives were
pulled out and destroyed.

28:16.790 --> 28:18.382
Any idea what
the blood tests were for?

28:18.430 --> 28:20.751
One theory is that Abby
suspected a colleague

28:20.800 --> 28:22.893
of shenanigans and was
seeking confirmation.

28:22.930 --> 28:25.262
Shenanigans?
You remember the
fertility doctor

28:25.300 --> 28:27.461
_in California who used
his own sperm to fertilize

28:27.500 --> 28:29.764
hundreds of eggs
without informing the mothers?

28:29.800 --> 28:30.937
It's possible
someone

28:30.970 --> 28:32.733
in Abby's lab
was doing the same.

28:32.770 --> 28:35.170
It would explain why she wanted
access to Dr. Amrit's lab.

28:35.210 --> 28:36.472
She may have been running
paternity tests.

28:36.510 --> 28:39.479
So that's one theory.
There any more?

28:39.510 --> 28:41.171
Not at present.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.347
But another may be
just a warrant away.

28:43.380 --> 28:45.189
It's possible that there's
a trace of Abby's research

28:45.220 --> 28:46.949
that her killer missed.

28:46.990 --> 28:49.857
The biological waste produced
by university labs is set aside

28:49.890 --> 28:51.858
in locked bins
for special processing.

28:51.890 --> 28:53.426
The waste is collected
three times a week.

28:53.460 --> 28:56.793
There was a pickup the night
before the lab was destroyed.

28:56.830 --> 28:59.060
So if Abby dumped
her test materials

28:59.100 --> 29:02.467
in one of those locked bins...

29:02.500 --> 29:04.468
The disposal company
might still have some.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.863
I'll get an ADA

29:05.910 --> 29:08.071
to get you a warrant.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.814
Sort of a clich, huh?

29:13.850 --> 29:16.819
Cop who actually hangs
out in a doughnut shop?

29:16.850 --> 29:18.818
Who told you I was here?

29:18.850 --> 29:21.819
I am not at liberty to say,
but I know why you've been

29:21.860 --> 29:24.556
harassing me. Before you
moved to Burglary, you were

29:24.590 --> 29:26.353
in the Bronx under Ann Vescey.

29:26.390 --> 29:29.518
Rumor has it she promised to
transfer you to Major Crimes

29:29.560 --> 29:32.529
when she was tapped to take
over for Captain Gregson.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.561
That would have been
a big step up for you.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.067
Only she didn't
take over for Gregson,

29:36.100 --> 29:37.567
because he didn't leave.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.409
You blame me for that.

29:39.440 --> 29:42.000
Obviously, you found out that
I was looking into Vescey.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.905
You think I torpedoed her.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.975
What is that?

29:46.010 --> 29:47.910
Everything I gave
Captain Gregson. Read it.

29:47.950 --> 29:50.475
You'll see that I found
Vescey was clean.

29:50.520 --> 29:54.217
The captain decided not to step
aside because he was not ready.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.455
Not because of
anything I said.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.549
It's heavy.

29:58.590 --> 30:00.785
You put a lot of work into this.

30:02.630 --> 30:04.291
I don't care

30:04.330 --> 30:06.423
what you did or didn't
find out about Ann.

30:06.470 --> 30:08.961
What I care about
is that you looked at all.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.490
You're not a cop.

30:10.540 --> 30:13.338
_ You're a citizen
With delu5ions of grandeur.

30:13.370 --> 30:16.237
Cops-- real cops--
we have enough people

30:16.280 --> 30:17.941
looking over our shoulders.

30:17.980 --> 30:20.403
Politicians,
the press, the brass,

30:20.450 --> 30:23.442
IAB. They second-guess us
all day long.

30:23.480 --> 30:26.586
But, hey, that's
what they're there for.

30:26.620 --> 30:29.111
Who are you
to look into us?

30:29.160 --> 30:31.481
I take it you've never
used a consultant before?

30:31.530 --> 30:33.020
No,

30:33.060 --> 30:34.493
I've never used a consultant.

30:34.530 --> 30:36.998
Real cops do the job themselves.

30:37.030 --> 30:38.292
That's how it works.

30:38.330 --> 30:41.060
You don't belong.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.533
I don't know
what to tell you, Detective.

30:42.570 --> 30:44.060
I'm not going anywhere.

30:46.140 --> 30:48.108
But you were.

30:48.140 --> 30:49.971
You and your partner.

30:50.010 --> 30:51.898
And now
you're both back.

30:51.950 --> 30:53.201
That's weird, right?

30:53.250 --> 30:54.979
I just caught
a new case last night.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.272
It's gonna keep me busy
for a while, but after that,

30:57.320 --> 31:00.448
I don't know.
Maybe I'll circle back around.

31:00.490 --> 31:02.481
See what else I can find.

31:14.670 --> 31:18.003
All that came from
Dr. Amrit's lab?

31:18.040 --> 31:21.271
It seems the_medical waste
for the entire univerSIty

31:21.310 --> 31:23.073
was labeled identically.

31:23.110 --> 31:25.249
A team is being assembled
to sort through it,

31:25.280 --> 31:28.113
but I thought you and I could
get the ball rolling.

31:28.150 --> 31:29.913
Okay, but...

31:29.950 --> 31:32.145
Gloves, goggles, mask,
right behind you there.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.010
You can apprise me
of your meeting

31:34.060 --> 31:37.086
with your stalker
as we sort.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.122
Mm.

31:42.130 --> 31:44.223
WATSON:
I think she may be insane.

31:44.270 --> 31:47.091
Because she doesn't
like you?
Because she's fixating on me.

31:47.130 --> 31:49.166
In her defense, you were
investigating her friend

31:49.200 --> 31:51.168
and you are a mere citizen.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.939
So are you.

31:52.970 --> 31:55.609
But I'm quite accustomed
to people not liking me.

31:55.640 --> 31:58.177
Okay, so what if she continues
to look into me, into us,

31:58.210 --> 32:00.303
and figures out that your father
pulled some strings

32:00.350 --> 32:02.011
to get us back into the 11th?

32:02.050 --> 32:03.312
As I see it,

32:03.350 --> 32:05.215
the crux of the matter
is that Detective Cortes

32:05.250 --> 32:07.389
sees you as an outsider
and not a peer.

32:07.420 --> 32:10.548
If you were a cop, you would
have what is called a "beef".

32:10.590 --> 32:13.058
And a beef can be settled
and what you have cannot be.

32:13.090 --> 32:16.025
Because I'm _a consultant.
PreCIsely.

32:16.060 --> 32:19.223
So I-I just take it, I just
let her keep bullying me?

32:20.770 --> 32:23.591
As I said before,
she does not see you as a peer,

32:23.640 --> 32:25.335
so force her to.

32:25.370 --> 32:28.271
You remember the disagreement
that Detectives Grell and Luntz

32:28.310 --> 32:30.437
had last year?
Yeah.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.209
It festered for months,
then it was resolved.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.138
Do you recall
how it was resolved?

32:36.120 --> 32:36.939
You're not serious.

32:36.980 --> 32:38.618
I have reason to believe
Detective Cortes

32:38.650 --> 32:40.288
would be amenable to the idea.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.080
(sighs)

32:43.120 --> 32:44.758
Six plastic vials,
each containing

32:44.790 --> 32:47.281
blood residue, and each one...

32:47.330 --> 32:51.198
with Abby Campbell's handwriting
on the labels.

32:51.230 --> 32:54.131
Looks like she was thorough.

32:54.170 --> 32:56.195
Test subjects are identified

32:56.240 --> 32:59.664
by initials, plus dates
and times of collection.

32:59.710 --> 33:01.632
These samples were gathered
on three consecutive Thursdays

33:01.680 --> 33:04.069
between the hours
of 9:00 and 10:00p.m.

33:04.110 --> 33:05.441
Does that mean something to you?

33:05.480 --> 33:07.209
Memorizing a murder victim's
calendar

33:07.250 --> 33:08.615
is a matter of course.

33:08.650 --> 33:11.289
I know where she was
at these times,

33:11.320 --> 33:15.154
so I know who to talk to
about the work she was doing.

33:15.190 --> 33:17.215
WOMAN:
Support groups

33:17.260 --> 33:20.127
can be very helpful
for cancer patients.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.220
They're going through
so many things

33:23.260 --> 33:26.127
that only their
peers can understand.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.138
And Abby Campbell had been
attending your group

33:28.170 --> 33:29.569
for three months?

33:29.600 --> 33:32.660
Ever since her diagnosis.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.177
We have reason to believe

33:34.210 --> 33:36.405
that she was collecting blood
during these meetings.

33:36.440 --> 33:39.204
May we assume it was
from her fellow group members?

33:41.180 --> 33:43.717
Ms. Russof, this is a
murder investigation.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.489
A few weeks ago,
Abby made a pitch to the group.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.556
She said she had a friend

33:50.590 --> 33:53.286
who was doing
advanced cancer research.

33:53.330 --> 33:55.321
It was supposed
to be promising.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.590
Maybe even a cure.

33:57.630 --> 34:00.064
She said she could get people
into the study.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.261
She just needed blood samples

34:02.300 --> 34:04.439
to test for
suitability.

34:04.470 --> 34:06.506
Sounds like
you had your doubts.

34:06.540 --> 34:11.500
People are always touting
miracle cures for cancer.

34:11.550 --> 34:15.111
You can probably guess
how many pan out.

34:15.150 --> 34:17.516
I wasn't the only one
who was skeptical.

34:17.550 --> 34:20.519
The husband of one of the group
members came to a meeting,

34:20.550 --> 34:22.359
and he accused Abby

34:22.390 --> 34:24.824
of being a con
artist. He said

34:24.860 --> 34:26.828
that if she didn't
leave his wife alone,

34:26.860 --> 34:29.749
she would be sorry.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.769
Can you give us
this person's name?
Kirk.

34:32.800 --> 34:35.268
Kirk Abramovitch.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.858
Yeah, I threatened
Abby Campbell.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.130
No, I didn't turn her
into a skeleton.

34:39.170 --> 34:41.638
You make it sound absurd,
Mr. Abramovitch.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.307
But on your social
media page,

34:43.340 --> 34:45.240
I've seen pictures
of you pitching in

34:45.280 --> 34:46.474
at your father's
butcher shop.

34:46.510 --> 34:49.240
I got to think knowing
how to work a deli slicer

34:49.280 --> 34:51.384
and deboning a person
are two very different things.

34:51.420 --> 34:53.388
WOMAN:
That night at therapy,

34:53.420 --> 34:54.819
Kirk only yelled
at Abby because

34:54.860 --> 34:56.714
he thought she was
trying to scam me.

34:56.760 --> 34:59.627
He just wanted
her to back off.
I've seen
her type before.

34:59.660 --> 35:02.197
Kirk's mother died of colon
cancer in the late '905.

35:02.230 --> 35:04.869
KIRK:
She got suckered
by every snake oil salesman

35:04.900 --> 35:06.367
that crossed her path.

35:06.400 --> 35:10.234
She tried light therapy,
magnets, special diets,

35:10.270 --> 35:11.908
shark cartilage.

35:11.940 --> 35:14.738
She ended up taking out
a second mortgage on her house

35:14.780 --> 35:17.305
to pay for some fancy clinic
down in Mexico.

35:17.340 --> 35:18.546
All for nothing.

35:18.580 --> 35:20.343
WOMAN:
I didn't think
there was any harm

35:20.380 --> 35:22.416
in looking into the
study Abby told us about,

35:22.450 --> 35:24.816
but, the truth is,
I didn't need it.

35:24.850 --> 35:26.249
My chemo's working.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.643
Dr. Campbell says

35:27.690 --> 35:29.419
I'm doing really well.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.382
Dr. Campbell,
as in Nate Campbell?

35:31.430 --> 35:32.829
So,

35:32.860 --> 35:35.590
Abby's husband is
your oncologist?

35:35.630 --> 35:37.791
That's why I agreed
to give Abby my blood--

35:37.830 --> 35:39.422
because she was his wife.

35:39.470 --> 35:42.268
I thought she must know
what she's talking about.

35:42.300 --> 35:44.268
(baby crying over monitor)

35:44.310 --> 35:46.403
Oh, that's our
son. Can I

35:46.440 --> 35:48.328
go get him?

35:52.480 --> 35:54.209
(footsteps approaching)

35:54.250 --> 35:55.740
(knocking)

35:55.780 --> 35:57.418
Oh, hey.

35:57.450 --> 35:59.589
Hi. Oh, he's beautiful.

35:59.620 --> 36:02.453
A hundred percentile
in height and weight.
Ah.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.185
He's gonna be
a big guy.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.380
Oh, just like
his daddy.
(laughing):
Yeah, right?

36:06.430 --> 36:08.398
Hmm.

36:08.430 --> 36:10.523
Do you mind me asking what kind
of cancer you have?

36:10.560 --> 36:13.427
Spinal plasmacytoma.

36:13.470 --> 36:15.335
I had some back pain,
there was a lump.

36:15.370 --> 36:16.928
Dr. Campbell prescribed chemo.

36:16.970 --> 36:19.438
And where is the tumor located?

36:19.470 --> 36:21.438
On my L4.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.847
I used to be a surgeon.
Do you mind if a take a look?

36:24.880 --> 36:26.745
Okay. Okay.

36:26.780 --> 36:29.544
I'm gonna put you down
for a second, sweetie.

36:29.580 --> 36:32.344
Right here.

36:32.390 --> 36:34.415
Right here.

36:34.460 --> 36:37.281
Okay, if you could just
stand straight for me.

36:40.930 --> 36:43.296
Okay, so, on a scale
of one to ten--

36:43.330 --> 36:46.493
ten being the worst--
um, how does this feel?

36:46.530 --> 36:48.498
A little uncomfortable.
Maybe a two.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.531
Mm.
(baby jumping)

36:50.570 --> 36:53.403
And are you taking
anything for the pain?

36:53.440 --> 36:54.737
Uh, just naproxen.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.509
Yeah.

36:56.540 --> 36:58.542
Is the discomfort worse
at night?

36:58.580 --> 37:01.549
A little bit,
but the medicine helps.

37:01.580 --> 37:04.617
Well, for what it's worth,
I think Dr. Campbell's right.

37:04.650 --> 37:07.380
You should make
a full recovery.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.981
In case you were
wondering, Watson,

37:11.020 --> 37:13.386
Mr. Abramovitch does
not have an alibi

37:13.430 --> 37:15.489
for the night of
Abby Campbell's murder.

37:15.530 --> 37:18.260
I don't think
he did it.
Neither do I.

37:18.300 --> 37:20.791
But that's because I stayed for
the duration of his interview,

37:20.830 --> 37:22.969
and I saw no indication
that he was lying.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.366
Why do you think
he's innocent?

37:25.410 --> 37:27.731
Because I'm pretty sure
I know who did kill Abby.

37:27.770 --> 37:29.374
You do?

37:29.410 --> 37:30.877
It all made sense
once I realized

37:30.910 --> 37:33.572
Sadie Abramovitch
doesn't have cancer.

37:40.420 --> 37:41.751
This is Sadie
Abramovitch before chemo.

37:41.790 --> 37:44.827
Do you recognize her?
Of course.

37:44.860 --> 37:46.782
It says here
that you're treating her

37:46.830 --> 37:47.979
for spinal plasmacytoma.

37:48.030 --> 37:50.658
The tumor is located
on her L4 vertebra.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.759
That sounds right.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.290
She's doing quite well.

37:54.340 --> 37:56.069
We're hoping
for a complete remission.

37:56.100 --> 37:57.863
You should know

37:57.900 --> 37:59.504
that when we visited
Mrs. Abramovitch,

37:59.540 --> 38:01.064
my colleague noted
several inconsistencies

38:01.110 --> 38:03.977
with her diagnosis.
Spinal plasmacytoma

38:04.010 --> 38:06.877
_ causes microfractures
in the affected vertebrae.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.844
Most patients can barely walk.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.610
Sadie can move around just fine,
sit, stand, walk.

38:11.650 --> 38:13.515
Lift her baby.
No issues.

38:13.550 --> 38:15.552
We diagnosed Sadie
very early on,

38:15.590 --> 38:17.512
so, the microfractures

38:17.560 --> 38:19.687
didn't have time
to fully develop.

38:19.730 --> 38:21.925
Hmm. And you never
removed the tumor?

38:21.960 --> 38:23.825
No. Too much nerve involvement.

38:23.860 --> 38:26.363
WATSON:
That makes sense.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.095
Except when I pressed
directly on her L4,

38:28.130 --> 38:30.098
instead of a sharp pain,

38:30.140 --> 38:32.062
she only felt a dull ache.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.032
And her discomfort gets worse
at night,

38:34.070 --> 38:37.938
which is a classic symptom
of a benign osteoid osteoma.

38:37.980 --> 38:40.574
I stand by my diagnosis.

38:40.610 --> 38:41.918
MAN:
Excuse me,

38:41.950 --> 38:43.042
but my client agreed
to this interview

38:43.080 --> 38:44.616
in order to help you

38:44.650 --> 38:45.912
find his wife's killer.

38:45.950 --> 38:48.111
Now, I fail to see
how a possible misdiagnosis

38:48.150 --> 38:50.550
of one his patients has

38:50.590 --> 38:53.753
any relevance.
One misdiagnosis would not.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.398
Several dozen,
however,

38:57.430 --> 39:00.069
tell an entirely
different story.

39:00.100 --> 39:02.933
BELL:
After we got a warrant for
your files the other day,

39:02.970 --> 39:05.438
we asked all your patients
to get follow-up exams.

39:05.470 --> 39:07.461
Of those who agreed
to be tested,

39:07.510 --> 39:10.001
almost a third didn't
have cancer at all.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.871
HOLMES:
You've been
misdiagnosing patients,

39:11.910 --> 39:13.571
and you've been
subjecting them

39:13.610 --> 39:17.011
to unnecessary chemotherapy,
probably for years,

39:17.050 --> 39:20.110
to-- I don't know--
bolster your profits,

39:20.150 --> 39:21.981
inflate your remission rates?

39:22.020 --> 39:24.989
And no one suspected you.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.828
Until your own wife got cancer.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.396
We figure Abby noticed
something fishy

39:29.430 --> 39:31.398
when she was getting
chemo at your clinic.

39:31.430 --> 39:32.988
Patients like Sadie,

39:33.030 --> 39:34.668
whose symptoms didn't
match their diagnoses.

39:34.700 --> 39:37.396
But she wanted proof,
so she ran tests.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.998
HOLMES:
Her mistake

39:39.040 --> 39:40.860
was confronting you
with the evidence

39:40.910 --> 39:42.901
of your misdeeds
before going to the authorities.

39:42.940 --> 39:45.977
Perhaps she thought you'd be
able to explain yourself.

39:46.010 --> 39:49.514
But instead, you strangled her.

39:49.550 --> 39:51.848
Do I need to point out,
this is all supposition?

39:51.890 --> 39:53.778
Nah, it's more
than that.

39:53.820 --> 39:56.084
We had_a talk with
your clinic manager.

39:56.120 --> 40:00.523
She rolled, confirmed
the false diagnoses,

40:00.560 --> 40:01.959
the fraud,
the whole thing.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.558
She also recanted
your alibi.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.864
In fact, the last
time she saw you

40:05.900 --> 40:07.891
the night that
Abby disappeared,

40:07.930 --> 40:09.761
you were headed
to the research wing

40:09.800 --> 40:12.064
right after a heated
phone call with Abby.

40:16.010 --> 40:18.205
I told her...

40:18.240 --> 40:21.971
that everything I did was
for the good of the family.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.113
Nate?
No, no, no. I'll...

40:26.220 --> 40:28.040
I'll tell you everything,

40:28.090 --> 40:30.513
but you need to let me talk
to Branford.

40:31.990 --> 40:35.153
I need to tell him I'm sorry.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.591
I'll see what
I can do.

40:44.140 --> 40:46.802
Good combination.

40:48.110 --> 40:50.476
(sighs)

40:50.510 --> 40:52.569
Third time you've approached me.

40:52.610 --> 40:55.147
If you're smart,
there won't be a fourth.

40:55.180 --> 40:57.978
Actually, a fourth time is what
I wanted to talk to you about.

40:58.020 --> 41:01.012
The NYPD Boxing Club is having
a match in a few weeks.

41:01.050 --> 41:03.257
I thought maybe we could
raise some money for charity.

41:03.290 --> 41:05.520
You want to fight me?

41:05.560 --> 41:07.721
That's how it
done, right?

41:07.760 --> 41:09.022
When two cops have a
problem with each other

41:09.060 --> 41:10.652
and they can't resolve it?

41:10.700 --> 41:13.021
Yeah, the only problem is,
you're not a cop.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.992
And that would be
bad for you, right?

41:15.040 --> 41:17.895
Getting your ass
kicked by a consultant?

41:17.940 --> 41:19.760
(laughs)

41:19.810 --> 41:22.199
If you want to fight me
so bad, why wait?

41:22.240 --> 41:24.105
There's a ring right there.

41:24.140 --> 41:29.077
Yeah, I thought that's
what you might say.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.145
All right.

41:40.190 --> 41:42.750
HOLMES:
Keep them submerged
as long as you can.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.961
I know how to treat
sore knuckles.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.025
This needs more flour.
You just like

41:47.070 --> 41:48.765
the parallel.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.097
Primitive _a_fterca re
for a primitive sport.

41:50.140 --> 41:53.906
While this might look primitive,

41:53.940 --> 41:57.103
I assure, this is the result

41:57.140 --> 41:58.903
of years
of painstaking research.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.941
It's a poultice
of comfrey leaves and flour

42:00.980 --> 42:03.744
with a dash of mountain arnica
and a sprinkling of marigold.

42:03.780 --> 42:05.213
I highly recommend it.

42:05.250 --> 42:06.979
Unless, of course,
you want your eye

42:07.020 --> 42:08.715
to blacken as a badge of honor.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.081
I just want to put
this whole thing behind me.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.179
And does Detective Cortes feel
the same way?

42:13.230 --> 42:14.788
Oh, I guess we'll see.

42:14.830 --> 42:16.252
At the very least,

42:16.300 --> 42:19.292
this has proven the wisdom
of continuously training

42:19.330 --> 42:21.264
in the combat arts.

42:21.300 --> 42:23.791
You do, of course, need
to work on your defense.

42:26.010 --> 42:27.637
I did.

42:27.670 --> 42:32.004
But all that matters is
that I landed the last one.

42:32.050 --> 42:35.213
* And I won't let you

42:35.250 --> 42:40.210
* Out of my life...

42:40.250 --> 42:42.309
* And I won't let you
out of my life... *
