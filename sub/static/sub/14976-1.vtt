00:57.658 --> 00:59.788
Don't blow your hands off.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.787
You're going to need them later.

01:12.774 --> 01:15.844
Dude!

01:15.877 --> 01:17.837
Did you see that?

01:17.879 --> 01:20.779
All right.
Pyrotechnics are over.

01:20.815 --> 01:22.675
Let's swim.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.524
Last one in takes their top off.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.161
Don't you dare!

01:42.336 --> 01:45.266
-Will you get me a beer?
-I'd love to.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.536
You're so...

02:23.678 --> 02:27.308
Hey, Dawn,
got something for you.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.218
Listen, Wyatt,
I already told you.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.620
I am not interested
in your something.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.920
-What is this?
-Light it.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.586
So cool.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.488
Sadie, look at this.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.030
<i>Sadie?</i>

02:47.535 --> 02:50.935
Sadie? Sadie?

03:02.750 --> 03:04.250
Where did she go?

03:06.220 --> 03:07.090
Sadie?

03:17.932 --> 03:18.802
Wyatt?

03:22.436 --> 03:23.736
Wyatt!

03:45.626 --> 03:46.756
Get out of the water!

03:50.464 --> 03:52.164
Faster! Hurry!

04:01.309 --> 04:04.409
Okay...

04:04.445 --> 04:06.775
We leave in five minutes.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.414
Okay.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.779
We've got a really
long drive ahead of us,

04:10.818 --> 04:12.688
<i>and I would like to
be there in time for lunch.</i>

04:13.821 --> 04:15.651
<i>This should be the last of it.</i>

04:15.690 --> 04:17.959
<i>Good. Not sure how
much more we can fit.</i>

04:17.992 --> 04:20.791
We can strap Harrison
to the roof.

04:20.827 --> 04:25.458
Yeah, or Molly could just stay
back and water the plants.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.599
Can I?

04:26.634 --> 04:28.904
<i>No. You're coming.</i>

04:30.905 --> 04:33.105
<i>Is there a body
in here?</i>

04:33.140 --> 04:34.470
<i>Not yet.</i>

04:34.508 --> 04:36.938
You got any threes?

04:36.978 --> 04:40.008
Go fish.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.247
Come on!

04:44.185 --> 04:47.345
Do you have any...

04:53.194 --> 04:54.494
fours?

04:54.528 --> 04:57.458
Are you kidding me?

04:57.498 --> 05:00.168
You're killing me.
This is ridiculous.

05:00.201 --> 05:03.701
Okay, Grandma, new plan.
Let's ditch these losers.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.468
Forget camping.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.466
You and I,
we're going to Vegas.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.967
Let's make some money.

05:08.009 --> 05:09.169
Let's have some real fun.
How about that?

05:09.210 --> 05:11.340
-Got it.
-Cool.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.049
<i>What?</i>

05:15.850 --> 05:18.920
<i>Come on!
Are you...</i>

05:18.953 --> 05:21.693
Cheaters never
prosper, Molly.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.022
Tell that to Grandma.

05:23.057 --> 05:24.987
Time to go.

05:25.026 --> 05:27.356
Who's ready
for Lake Drover?

05:27.395 --> 05:29.185
Yay!

05:29.230 --> 05:30.930
Woo!

05:35.236 --> 05:36.566
Yay.

05:36.604 --> 05:40.514
That's the spirit!
Let's roll!

05:40.541 --> 05:41.971
Go.

06:37.098 --> 06:39.568
Did you see what Becky
was wearing the other day?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.900
It was an assault
to the eyes.

06:41.936 --> 06:44.596
It's like she has zero
consideration for those of us

06:44.638 --> 06:46.338
that have to
look at her all day.

06:46.373 --> 06:50.483
Some people are so oblivious
to the feelings of others.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.381
God, I know.

07:02.356 --> 07:04.586
Say cheese.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.815
Cheese, bitch.

07:08.229 --> 07:10.359
And don't post
that anywhere.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.357
My boss thinks I'm home
with the bird flu.

07:16.137 --> 07:19.937
My God.
Amanda, I look hideous.

07:19.974 --> 07:22.884
How could you not warn me
about all these flyaways?

07:34.155 --> 07:38.485
This water is ruining
my composition.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.413
Amanda?

07:55.442 --> 07:58.412
Amanda? Amanda?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.204
Let's stretch
our legs, everyone.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.214
You having fun yet?

08:29.243 --> 08:31.343
Yeah, sure.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.347
This spot is very special
to your Grandma.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.380
She used to come here
every summer as a little girl.

08:35.416 --> 08:37.376
Did you know that?

08:37.418 --> 08:38.578
No.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.592
But I'm beginning
to see the appeal.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.187
Pull it together, son.

08:48.229 --> 08:50.959
Let's go get the cabin keys.

08:54.235 --> 08:56.435
What kind of trouble
are you two getting into?

08:58.505 --> 09:00.705
Hey, Molls, you know,
you can at least pretend

09:00.741 --> 09:03.211
<i>like you're having
a good time.</i>

09:03.244 --> 09:06.214
I could, but who would
I be fooling, really?

09:06.247 --> 09:08.947
Come on.
It's not all that bad.

09:10.417 --> 09:13.047
We got good weather.
We got free food.

09:13.087 --> 09:14.887
Mom's doing my laundry.
It's great.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.562
You're such a good son.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.591
Thanks for noticing,
Molls.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.058
Hey, beautiful.
How you doing?

09:23.097 --> 09:25.157
<i>You feel okay
from the trip?</i>

09:25.199 --> 09:28.729
Being here brings back
a lot of nice memories.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.899
Yeah?

09:30.938 --> 09:32.338
Well, I'm happy
to share it with you.

09:35.476 --> 09:37.736
You want to go talk to those
pretty girls, don't you?

09:37.778 --> 09:40.248
Yes, more than anything.
Do you mind?

09:40.281 --> 09:42.651
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

09:45.486 --> 09:47.016
Harrison?

09:48.489 --> 09:49.349
What?

09:51.325 --> 09:52.655
Hair?

10:04.338 --> 10:05.438
There you go.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.012
Paddles for the canoe
are under the bunk bed.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.272
We've had trouble
with the pipes,

10:09.310 --> 10:10.940
so if you have problems,
give me a holler.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.648
Thank you, mister...

10:13.681 --> 10:15.351
-Jones.
-Mr. Jones.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.822
Just Jones.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.351
What's the best number
to reach you?

10:20.387 --> 10:21.647
Don't have one.

10:21.689 --> 10:25.289
Well, how do we holler?

10:25.326 --> 10:27.656
Hey, Jones!
I need some tidbits.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.655
<i>You got any five eyes?</i>

10:29.697 --> 10:31.897
Sure do, tiger.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.032
Got it.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.237
Back here somewhere.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.491
Expecting a call?

10:53.520 --> 10:55.690
No.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.723
It's a weekend, Molly.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.618
A long weekend.

11:01.195 --> 11:03.125
You can live three days
without him.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.440
Everyone set?

11:15.876 --> 11:18.436
<i>-Let's go, Harrison!
-Okay.</i>

11:24.218 --> 11:25.518
<i>-Cool.
-Let's go, Harrison!</i>

11:25.552 --> 11:28.852
Okay! All right,
I'll see you later.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.959
Bye.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.361
What?

11:32.393 --> 11:34.063
Let's go!

11:34.094 --> 11:36.764
<i>-I'm working here.
-I see that.</i>

11:51.078 --> 11:52.478
You got it?

11:55.682 --> 11:58.222
<i>Harrison, will you come
grab some bags?</i>

11:58.252 --> 12:01.222
<i>Yep. Yeah, hand me
the heavy ones.</i>

12:01.255 --> 12:03.655
Last stop, princess.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.220
<i>I thought we were
only here for a few days.</i>

12:05.259 --> 12:07.229
<i>Looks like
we're moving in.</i>

12:07.261 --> 12:09.261
<i>Your dad might
have brought</i>

12:09.296 --> 12:10.496
<i>the whole sporting goods
store along for the trip.</i>

12:15.269 --> 12:16.899
I'll be back to help
you out, hon.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.767
<i>Okay. Sounds good.</i>

12:19.807 --> 12:22.607
Come here.

12:22.643 --> 12:25.983
Now that is a view.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.913
<i>It's a lake.</i>

12:28.949 --> 12:32.779
It's a beautiful lake.
Check it out.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.250
Check it out?

12:34.288 --> 12:39.788
Yeah, take it in.
Enjoy nature's splendor.

12:39.827 --> 12:40.827
Harrison!

12:42.663 --> 12:44.263
Don't be a lagger!

12:44.298 --> 12:45.828
<i>Coming!</i>

12:54.675 --> 12:58.705
Hey. Hello!

13:01.315 --> 13:02.945
You going to help us?

13:02.983 --> 13:04.883
Can't.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.819
Why?

13:07.855 --> 13:09.715
I'm enjoying nature's splendor.

13:10.524 --> 13:11.864
Okay.

13:38.519 --> 13:40.389
You know she dies
in the end?

13:41.355 --> 13:43.985
What are you doing here?

13:44.024 --> 13:47.494
I took a bus.
I wanted to surprise you.

13:47.528 --> 13:48.858
I can't believe you're here.

13:48.896 --> 13:51.256
<i>I know, right?</i>

13:56.236 --> 13:57.866
<i>Ahem.</i>

13:57.905 --> 13:59.665
Hey, Mrs. K.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.536
Hello, Curtis.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.105
He followed me home.
Can I keep him?

14:03.143 --> 14:05.183
I suppose.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.912
Don't worry.
We'll keep it totally PG.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.881
We have a house guest.

14:12.920 --> 14:16.350
And I thought we could
head out in the canoe,

14:16.390 --> 14:18.060
just the two of us,
like we used to

14:18.091 --> 14:19.461
<i>when you were
a little girl.</i>

14:22.229 --> 14:24.729
Why don't we go out
just the two of us, Rick?

14:26.400 --> 14:28.970
You know, we can let the
kids go do their own thing.

14:29.002 --> 14:33.042
You know, it might be nice
to have a little time alone.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.673
Come here.

14:39.613 --> 14:42.553
-Dude.
-Hey!

14:42.583 --> 14:44.083
What are you doing here, man?

14:44.117 --> 14:46.217
-Harrison!
-What's up, man?

14:46.253 --> 14:47.553
What a good surprise.

14:47.588 --> 14:49.048
It's going to be
such a good weekend now.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.719
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

14:50.757 --> 14:53.387
Seems like he couldn't
stay away from your sister.

14:53.427 --> 14:55.827
That's awesome.
Cool.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.832
<i>Great.</i>

14:57.864 --> 15:00.234
All right, Grandma,

15:00.267 --> 15:01.927
It's going to be me
and you this weekend.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.799
<i>Ready to party?</i>

15:03.837 --> 15:07.567
Mom, why don't you take the kids
into town and show them the sights?

15:07.608 --> 15:11.478
Or find some great spot
on the water?

15:11.511 --> 15:15.351
I know just the place.
I'll go change.

15:19.653 --> 15:22.953
Hey, beautiful.
You're looking good.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.420
You ready to have fun?

15:24.458 --> 15:27.258
All right,
so who's hungry?

15:27.294 --> 15:28.994
All right,
it's unanimous.

15:32.633 --> 15:36.433
So we're definitely going to go
sneak off and make out, right?

15:36.470 --> 15:39.700
-Absolutely.
-Sweet.

16:00.494 --> 16:02.834
Grandma, you need any
help carrying anything?

16:02.863 --> 16:05.003
No, no. I got it.

16:05.032 --> 16:05.902
All right.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.801
You guys grab food. We'll go
stake out a spot on the water.

16:10.837 --> 16:13.297
Okay. Hey, did you
want anything special?

16:13.340 --> 16:16.140
A popsicle.
Cherry.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.676
Living dangerous.

16:18.712 --> 16:19.742
Like it!

16:22.716 --> 16:23.916
Howdy.

16:25.886 --> 16:27.316
What was that?

16:27.354 --> 16:29.324
I'm being friendly
with the local people.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.316
It's the Ozarks.
It's not the wild west.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.589
People in the Ozarks
know what howdy means.

16:37.364 --> 16:42.504
Dude! Ozarks.

16:42.536 --> 16:45.166
What can I get you fine
young gentlemen today?

16:45.205 --> 16:49.435
Let's do...
Let's do four hotdogs.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.951
Coming right up.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.180
So how you been, dude?
What you been up to, man?

16:56.216 --> 16:57.516
We got to hang out
more often, man.

16:57.551 --> 16:58.681
I know.
I've been busy.

16:58.719 --> 17:00.349
What's there
to do around here?

17:00.387 --> 17:01.887
What's the plan?
What's up? Talk to me.

17:01.922 --> 17:04.061
Hiking, fishing,

17:04.090 --> 17:06.521
more hiking...
Outdoorsy stuff.

17:06.560 --> 17:11.359
Right, so that's a list
of really boring activities.

17:11.397 --> 17:14.127
Don't want to do that.

17:14.166 --> 17:17.867
You know what? I did meet some
beautiful girls earlier in bikinis,

17:17.904 --> 17:20.074
and they invited us to
a fireworks festival.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.207
Okay. All right.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.411
I'll ask Molly...

17:22.442 --> 17:24.712
Your sister,
my girlfriend.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.234
I don't know if
you remember.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.779
I'll see if
she's cool with that.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.924
That still just sounds
really weird to me.

17:30.951 --> 17:32.251
I don't like that.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.745
Heart wants
what the heart wants.

17:33.787 --> 17:35.217
She's cute.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.385
You boys just
passing through?

17:37.424 --> 17:39.224
Vacation actually.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.389
We're staying in
a cabin on the lake.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.998
Hey, do you have,
like, mosquito stuff?

17:45.132 --> 17:46.402
Right.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.503
West Nile, dude.
No joke.

17:51.805 --> 17:54.405
'kay.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.411
I was thinking of spray.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.914
These woods ain't nothing
to mess with, boy.

17:59.946 --> 18:03.246
Full of wild animals.
Dangerous animals.

18:03.283 --> 18:06.623
<i>You wouldn't be the first person
to go missing around here.</i>

18:06.653 --> 18:09.593
Ain't no reasoning
with a wild animal.

18:09.623 --> 18:11.923
They're acting
on pure instinct.

18:11.958 --> 18:17.128
Slice you head to toe
before you can blink.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.434
These woods ain't safe,

18:19.466 --> 18:22.666
and this here
is the great equalizer.

18:27.007 --> 18:29.037
-Yeah.
-Cool.

18:29.075 --> 18:34.445
Thank you for that not at
all terrifying advice.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.151
We'll take that to heart,
but I think we're good

18:37.184 --> 18:40.354
with the hotdogs
and the chips, so...

18:40.387 --> 18:44.057
-Nothing else?
-Yeah...

18:45.826 --> 18:47.926
let me get
a popsicle.

18:49.863 --> 18:50.903
Cherry or grape?

18:55.869 --> 18:57.069
Cherry.

19:12.519 --> 19:15.189
I wish you would
have brought a suit.

19:15.222 --> 19:16.652
The water's real nice.

19:16.690 --> 19:17.190
The water's real nice.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.664
I'm good.

19:18.692 --> 19:21.992
Are you just planning on
reading that book all day?

19:22.028 --> 19:23.728
That's new.

19:23.763 --> 19:27.703
Adults don't usually play the
reading is bad for you card.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.244
I like a good book, Molly,

19:30.270 --> 19:32.740
but stick your nose
in one for too long,

19:32.772 --> 19:36.242
and you might miss out
on something big.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.706
I'll risk it.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.049
Suit yourself.

19:48.088 --> 19:51.718
This part is very deep.
Wasn't expecting that.

20:01.001 --> 20:02.731
Drat.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.507
Grandma!

20:17.150 --> 20:19.850
Grandma!

20:30.897 --> 20:32.897
Yeah.

20:34.034 --> 20:35.334
You like my wheels?

20:35.368 --> 20:36.998
Yeah, that's awesome.

20:37.037 --> 20:39.367
Six cylinder,
five-inch alter lift,

20:39.406 --> 20:44.876
15 bolt FF rear, and a
genuine harpoon cannon.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.181
Mounted it myself.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.782
Why do you need
a harpoon cannon?

20:47.814 --> 20:50.114
To shoot my harpoon with.

20:52.218 --> 20:53.818
Is your pal slow?

20:56.389 --> 20:58.689
Yes, but I think
what he meant was

20:58.725 --> 21:02.055
why would you need
a harpoon cannon?

21:02.095 --> 21:03.725
This ain't the city, boy.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.063
I like to be prepared.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.069
Okay.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.871
Just seems
a little extreme.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.041
Curtis! Curtis!

21:14.074 --> 21:15.374
-Moll?
-What's wrong?

21:15.408 --> 21:19.038
What is it?
What is it? Hey!

21:19.079 --> 21:20.209
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

21:20.246 --> 21:21.706
No, no, no, no!
Grandma, Grandma!

21:21.748 --> 21:23.548
-What? Where is Grandma?
-It pulled her in!

21:23.583 --> 21:25.223
She was standing
there one second and...

21:25.251 --> 21:26.851
Slow down! What are
you talking about?

21:26.886 --> 21:30.016
<i>-It grabbed her!
-What grabbed her?</i>

21:30.056 --> 21:33.686
It was...
It was a shark.

21:37.097 --> 21:38.397
Okay.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.701
No, Harrison.
I think she's dead!

21:42.102 --> 21:44.242
Show me where you were.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.640
Come on!

21:57.117 --> 22:00.077
<i>Careful, Molls.</i>

22:00.120 --> 22:01.990
Grandma!

22:03.289 --> 22:04.459
Grandma!

22:05.992 --> 22:07.592
Is this spot?

22:07.627 --> 22:10.897
Yes. Yeah, see?
My blanket's still here.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.599
-Okay.
-What's that?

22:14.634 --> 22:16.604
-What?
-Right there.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.436
I don't know.
I can't really tell.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.612
What are you doing?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.270
Are you, like,
going out there?

22:22.308 --> 22:23.908
No! Harrison, you
can't go out there!

22:23.943 --> 22:25.613
Relax. I'll be fine.
I'm just going for a swim.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.975
-It's not safe!
-It's fine, Molly.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.114
Calm down! Come on.

22:30.150 --> 22:32.980
It's fine. Just let him go.
Let him go.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.289
-Curtis, take my phone.
-Don't...

22:35.321 --> 22:37.021
If you see a shark,
just yell.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.530
No.

22:56.176 --> 22:57.836
What is it?

22:59.345 --> 23:00.975
It's her hat!

23:07.387 --> 23:10.147
Arm! Arm! Arm! Arm!

23:10.190 --> 23:12.160
Gross,
it touched me!

23:12.192 --> 23:14.532
I love that beanie.

23:19.199 --> 23:20.529
Harrison!

23:20.567 --> 23:22.397
<i>-Swim!
-Swim!</i>

23:24.504 --> 23:27.644
<i>Swim! Swim faster!</i>

23:30.243 --> 23:31.213
<i>Come on!</i>

23:31.244 --> 23:33.014
Hurry, Harrison! Swim!

23:52.232 --> 23:53.562
That there?

23:53.600 --> 23:55.130
Yes.

23:55.168 --> 23:56.198
One of those
dangerous creatures

23:56.236 --> 23:57.096
I was telling you about.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.752
Sheriff's office.
What's your emergency?

24:07.780 --> 24:08.910
<i>There's a shark
in the lake.</i>

24:11.117 --> 24:12.377
Can you repeat that?

24:12.418 --> 24:14.918
There's a shark
in the lake,

24:14.954 --> 24:16.224
or in the river,

24:16.256 --> 24:18.486
or just...
It's in the water here.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.925
You been drinking, son?

24:20.960 --> 24:22.330
<i>What? No!</i>

24:22.362 --> 24:24.562
I mean, no,
not today, I haven't.

24:24.597 --> 24:27.027
Look, it ate
my girlfriend's Grandma!

24:28.601 --> 24:30.201
I know you're trying
to be funny,

24:30.236 --> 24:34.866
but I suggest that you find
a better use of your time.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.106
Prank call.
Damn kids.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.235
Well, you know
how they get

24:40.280 --> 24:41.950
when the festival
rolls around.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.881
All that teenage mischief.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.745
Come on, you remember what it's
like to be young and impulsive.

24:50.290 --> 24:52.060
Or not.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.763
He hung up on me because
he doesn't believe me

24:55.795 --> 24:57.925
that there's a shark
in the river.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.364
Well, of course not. Whose ever
heard of a shark in a river before?

24:59.399 --> 25:01.929
This has happened
a couple times before.

25:01.968 --> 25:04.298
Most sharks can survive
in fresh water.

25:04.337 --> 25:05.597
But why would
they come here?

25:05.638 --> 25:07.268
They swim up
from the ocean.

25:07.307 --> 25:08.607
Sometimes they like
to give birth

25:08.641 --> 25:11.981
to their young
in the warm water.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.441
Ozark shark.

25:13.479 --> 25:15.409
Curtis...

25:15.448 --> 25:17.418
Never mind.

25:17.450 --> 25:18.780
When they come
to birth their young,

25:18.818 --> 25:20.278
<i>are they always
this aggressive?</i>

25:20.320 --> 25:23.090
No! Sharks don't
usually attack people,

25:23.122 --> 25:25.622
not even the ones that
have swam up here before.

25:25.658 --> 25:28.058
We've never had
a reported shark attack.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.494
What are you saying?

25:29.529 --> 25:32.799
I'm saying that something
riled this one up.

25:32.832 --> 25:38.842
The problem is that sometimes sharks
develop a taste for human blood.

25:42.008 --> 25:44.108
Not a good day
to go skinny dipping.

25:44.143 --> 25:47.213
Mom and Dad, they're
taking the canoe out.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.024
You don't want
the back seat?

25:53.052 --> 25:56.192
You're the one steering
this ship, captain.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.292
I'm just along
for the ride.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.124
All right.

26:00.159 --> 26:04.329
Plus, I have a way
better view from the bow

26:04.364 --> 26:07.334
for when I need to give
you directions.

26:07.367 --> 26:09.727
That's my lady.

26:12.372 --> 26:15.012
Well, I'm going to
do my best,

26:15.041 --> 26:19.241
but I know I was not your
first choice for canoe buddy.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.748
You'll do.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.859
There's no guarantee that they
left yet. They might be okay.

26:35.895 --> 26:38.355
All right.
I'm coming with you.

26:38.398 --> 26:39.858
-No.
-No, but...

26:39.899 --> 26:41.229
You've been
through a lot, okay?

26:41.267 --> 26:42.867
Well, so have you!

26:42.902 --> 26:44.902
<i>Yeah, but I don't know
what I'm going to find.</i>

26:44.937 --> 26:48.037
Just stay with Curtis
and Jones, please?

26:48.074 --> 26:49.344
Make sure she doesn't go
near the water, all right?

26:49.375 --> 26:51.175
Yeah, sure.

26:51.210 --> 26:54.010
I'll call you. I'll let
you know what I find out.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.345
It's okay. It's fine.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.724
The cabin's really close.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.052
I'm sure he'll get
to them in time.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.247
Wait! What are we
supposed to do?

27:02.288 --> 27:05.588
<i>Try animal control.</i>

27:05.625 --> 27:07.185
I'll call animal control.

27:17.804 --> 27:18.874
Mom!

27:27.814 --> 27:29.214
Dad!

27:57.443 --> 28:01.213
Hey, the canoe's gone. I don't
know. They left already.

28:01.247 --> 28:04.747
<i>I'm going to drive around
the lake and look for them.</i>

28:04.784 --> 28:07.124
Okay, well if you
find them, call me.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.093
Okay. Will do.

28:13.192 --> 28:16.032
We're too late. They're
already out on the water.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.798
Well, you know, we can't
just sit around here.

28:20.833 --> 28:21.833
We got to do something.

28:21.868 --> 28:24.338
Do you have a boat?

28:24.370 --> 28:26.740
We're not going
out on the water.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.973
<i>-You saw what happened. ¦
-He's got a gun.</i>

28:29.008 --> 28:31.508
Yeah, well, that bullet did
nothing to that shark!

28:31.544 --> 28:33.284
Baby, my parents
are out there!

28:33.312 --> 28:35.812
We have to find them and tell
them to get off of the water.

28:35.848 --> 28:38.148
No, the boy's right.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.924
We go out there, we going to
need a lot more firepower.

28:40.953 --> 28:43.393
What kind of firepower?

28:46.692 --> 28:48.392
Let me show you something.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.356
What is this place?

28:52.398 --> 28:53.958
My workshop.

29:03.509 --> 29:08.679
Holy shop.
What is all this stuff?

29:08.714 --> 29:10.514
<i>I told you.
I like to be prepared.</i>

29:10.550 --> 29:12.350
For what?
The zombie apocalypse?

29:12.385 --> 29:14.415
Among other things.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.525
All right,
this would work,

29:21.561 --> 29:24.401
but I'd have
to tweak it first.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.330
It'd take too long.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.710
Grab that.

29:36.742 --> 29:38.012
Totally.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.550
I get to use this?

29:42.582 --> 29:46.722
No. You get to hold it
until I use it.

29:46.752 --> 29:49.452
Okay. I'm fine with that.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.261
All right, guys,
we really have to get going.

29:53.292 --> 29:56.862
Let's find that shark
before it finds lunch.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.866
-Babe.
-Yeah, I'm coming.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.808
You missed.

31:14.840 --> 31:15.970
-Now, boy!
-What?

31:16.008 --> 31:17.438
Now!

31:27.620 --> 31:29.120
Yeah!

31:37.029 --> 31:38.559
That's what
I'm talking about!

31:41.200 --> 31:42.230
Watch out!

31:45.204 --> 31:49.144
Dude, you just stabbed
a shark with a trident.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.150
There's two of them.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.224
Six?

32:05.257 --> 32:06.487
Damn.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.501
We're going to need
a bigger everything.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.549
Mom!

32:31.984 --> 32:34.024
Dad!

32:38.991 --> 32:40.061
<i>Help!</i>

32:41.827 --> 32:42.887
Hello?

32:46.465 --> 32:47.795
<i>Help me!</i>

32:47.833 --> 32:49.973
Where are you?

32:50.002 --> 32:51.442
<i>Over here!</i>

32:51.470 --> 32:52.900
Hang on!

32:55.007 --> 32:56.167
I'm coming!

33:00.312 --> 33:01.582
<i>Hello?</i>

33:03.916 --> 33:06.046
Help me! Help me!

33:06.085 --> 33:09.445
Where are you? Keep yelling
so I can find you!

33:09.488 --> 33:12.258
Help me! Help!

33:12.291 --> 33:14.591
<i>Over here!</i>

33:16.195 --> 33:18.225
<i>Hello? Where are you?</i>

33:18.264 --> 33:21.204
-Hello?
-Help me!

33:22.334 --> 33:24.174
You all right?

33:24.203 --> 33:25.973
Not really. I'm stuck.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.635
It's all right.
I'm coming to get you.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.773
Wait.
You can't cross...

33:29.809 --> 33:31.439
It's fine. I know about
the sharks. It's okay.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.837
No, but you can just...

33:33.879 --> 33:35.809
It's fine.
It's not that far.

33:35.848 --> 33:37.348
I'm going to come,
all right?

33:37.383 --> 33:40.953
I know. Just wait.
I'm coming.

33:45.057 --> 33:48.127
-You okay?
-Yeah.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.830
All right.
Here I come.

34:09.081 --> 34:10.610
Smooth.

34:10.649 --> 34:14.018
That was the practice run.
I'm coming back out for you.

34:14.053 --> 34:17.822
You might want to
actually use the canoe.

34:24.263 --> 34:27.233
Yeah.

34:27.266 --> 34:29.666
Right. Okay.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.972
<i>Ozark code.</i>

34:36.007 --> 34:39.338
That which nature does
not provide, you devise.

34:39.378 --> 34:42.678
-Yes.
-Manners, boy.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.815
I like to call this
my paddle prod.

34:46.851 --> 34:50.722
2,500 volts
of pure punishment

34:50.755 --> 34:55.585
guaranteed to make
your target reconsider.

34:55.628 --> 34:57.358
How does it work?

34:57.396 --> 34:58.426
Little switch on the side.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.432
Guaranteed to
light up any room.

35:02.468 --> 35:07.098
Should we be using
that near water?

35:07.139 --> 35:08.309
Aim high.

35:16.115 --> 35:18.275
When would you ever
even need this?

35:18.317 --> 35:21.117
You need it now.

35:21.153 --> 35:22.423
Yeah, okay.
I guess.

35:22.454 --> 35:25.224
There you go.
Now put it down.

35:29.161 --> 35:31.431
This one is
particularly delicious.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.603
Nasty piece of business,

35:33.632 --> 35:35.602
but I think we can get
it to work on sharks.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.774
I don't know.
It says bear on it.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.343
I don't think so.

35:54.119 --> 35:55.819
Happy?

35:55.855 --> 35:58.315
You know, no.
I'm not very happy.

36:00.693 --> 36:02.793
What's under that tarp?

36:02.828 --> 36:05.798
Boy, you better pray you
never need to find out.

36:05.831 --> 36:09.471
Now, for our main attraction.

36:11.604 --> 36:13.804
Big Betty.

36:13.839 --> 36:16.909
Giant air cannon constructed
of piping and canisters.

36:16.942 --> 36:19.412
<i>That's awesome.</i>

36:19.445 --> 36:21.135
What does it shoot?

36:21.180 --> 36:22.850
The question is
what doesn't it shoot?

36:22.882 --> 36:25.682
Doesn't really
answer my question.

36:25.718 --> 36:27.348
Just about anything
you can put in it.

36:27.386 --> 36:32.086
-Awesome. I call that.
-No.

36:32.124 --> 36:34.834
<i>-Come on. Please?
-No.</i>

36:34.860 --> 36:38.260
You need
to learn to share.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.297
I want something.
Pick me out something.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.174
Here you go, son.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.366
Now, when that shark
swallows you,

36:49.408 --> 36:50.668
just pull that little pin.

36:50.709 --> 36:54.379
Dude, do not throw
a grenade, man!

36:54.413 --> 36:55.813
You're insane.

36:55.848 --> 36:58.878
I'm not going to get
swallowed by a shark.

36:58.918 --> 37:02.218
This one's for you.
Watch the recoil on that.

37:02.254 --> 37:04.864
I don't shoot guns.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.420
Time you learned, precious.

37:09.228 --> 37:11.698
Bullets will barely
even hurt those things.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.530
A whole bunch
of them might.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.826
Dude!
You gave her a gun?

37:16.869 --> 37:18.539
I want a gun.
Give me a gun.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.040
Look at all those
guns on the wall.

37:20.072 --> 37:21.542
Give me...
Give me something.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.313
Will you please
just give me something

37:23.342 --> 37:26.242
that I don't have to be
swallowed to use?

37:26.278 --> 37:28.208
No.

37:34.119 --> 37:35.219
No way.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.564
We're taking
the harpoon cannon truck?

37:40.592 --> 37:42.562
-Yes.
-Yes!

37:42.594 --> 37:45.204
-Can I drive?
-No.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.025
<i>I gotcha.</i>

37:50.402 --> 37:52.542
There's barely enough room for
us with all these weapons.

37:52.571 --> 37:56.211
In the grand scheme of
things, they take priority.

37:59.211 --> 38:02.211
-Let's go find your parents.
-Let's do it.!

38:02.247 --> 38:04.277
-Get in!
-Can I ride in the back?

38:04.316 --> 38:06.476
-Yes.
-Yes!

38:14.793 --> 38:16.233
<i>You saw them?</i>

38:16.261 --> 38:18.261
<i>-Yeah, I mean...
-Were you spying?</i>

38:18.297 --> 38:20.127
No, I wasn't spying, but
it's kind of weird seeing...

38:20.165 --> 38:21.125
Spy Dad.

38:21.166 --> 38:23.396
I don't remember
packing this.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.895
You didn't. Harrison did.

38:25.938 --> 38:28.768
Did you leave him any?

38:28.807 --> 38:31.167
No, I did not.

38:35.314 --> 38:37.414
Our son
has questionable taste.

38:37.449 --> 38:42.289
-So does our daughter.
-Curtis is harmless.

38:42.321 --> 38:44.421
All I'm saying,
is I preferred him

38:44.456 --> 38:47.786
as Harrison's unemployed,
irresponsible friend,

38:47.826 --> 38:50.126
<i>as opposed
to my unemployed,</i>

38:50.162 --> 38:52.002
<i>irresponsible,
future son-in-law.</i>

38:52.031 --> 38:54.161
It's her first
real relationship.

38:54.199 --> 38:57.499
Yeah, I mean,
they're young.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.796
She'll outgrow him...
I hope.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.168
Don't worry.

39:01.206 --> 39:03.636
You're going to have
plenty of new boyfriends

39:03.675 --> 39:05.505
to irrationally hate.

39:08.180 --> 39:11.080
-We should probably go back.
-Just a little bit longer.

39:11.116 --> 39:14.146
Maybe me and you could
rock the boat a little.

39:20.025 --> 39:23.785
-What was that?
-I don't know what that was.

39:26.231 --> 39:27.861
Honey?

39:34.306 --> 39:36.066
It can't be.

39:38.877 --> 39:42.977
Row! Diane! Row!

39:44.716 --> 39:45.646
To the shore!

39:49.588 --> 39:51.858
No!

39:51.890 --> 39:54.120
No, no!
Rick, don't!

39:54.159 --> 39:56.559
I got it.
I can almost...

39:56.595 --> 39:57.485
-Don't!
-I got it!

40:12.244 --> 40:14.584
This isn't the way
to the cabin.

40:14.613 --> 40:17.383
I think I know my way around these
woods better than you do, missy.

40:17.416 --> 40:20.416
I'm going the back way around
the lake. It's quicker.

40:20.452 --> 40:21.692
Hey, what's up, guys?

40:21.720 --> 40:24.090
Get in the back, son!

40:24.123 --> 40:26.593
<i>Your shirt.</i>

40:26.625 --> 40:28.955
Tight!
Make it tight and elevate.

40:32.965 --> 40:35.365
<i>-It got my ring! ¦
-Okay, hold on! Hold on.</i>

40:41.773 --> 40:43.143
<i>Pull it back.</i>

40:58.323 --> 41:01.763
<i>You got it!</i>

41:01.793 --> 41:03.293
Nice shot!

41:10.302 --> 41:12.302
Okay.

41:21.914 --> 41:24.754
Hey, you ever shoot the harpoon
cannon while you're driving?

41:24.783 --> 41:26.753
I'm about to shoot you
while driving.

41:26.785 --> 41:30.245
-No, you're not.
-A flare.

41:31.290 --> 41:33.120
Flare. Right there.
Over there.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.388
All right. All right.
I got it. I'm on it.

41:47.673 --> 41:50.473
What's your name?

41:50.509 --> 41:51.779
Dawn.

41:51.810 --> 41:54.280
I'm Harrison.

41:54.313 --> 41:56.113
How did you get
stuck out there?

41:56.148 --> 41:58.948
I was out on the water
with some friends,

41:58.984 --> 42:01.324
and this shark showed up.

42:01.353 --> 42:04.593
And they just
left you out there?

42:05.824 --> 42:06.994
No.

42:07.025 --> 42:10.685
Yeah.

42:13.532 --> 42:15.432
It got my Grandma, too.

42:17.536 --> 42:19.096
Sorry.

42:23.442 --> 42:24.642
No!

42:33.719 --> 42:35.319
Where is this going?

42:35.354 --> 42:38.094
I don't know.
Let's just go!

42:38.123 --> 42:40.163
No, I mean,
where does this lead?

42:40.192 --> 42:41.792
To the lake. My God.

42:41.827 --> 42:43.627
There's, like, this huge
firework celebration tonight.

42:43.662 --> 42:45.162
Half the town's going
to be on the water.

42:45.197 --> 42:46.827
We have...
We have to warn them.

42:46.865 --> 42:49.365
My phone's at
the bottom of the river.

42:49.401 --> 42:50.471
Do you have...

42:50.502 --> 42:52.342
No, I left it in
my friend's truck.

42:52.371 --> 42:53.541
There's never any
service out there.

42:53.572 --> 42:56.112
Damn.
All right. Hop in.

42:56.141 --> 42:59.341
-Are you crazy, dude?
-My parents are in the water.

42:59.378 --> 43:01.008
I'm not going to let this
thing get the drop on them.

43:01.046 --> 43:02.176
We got to go.

43:02.214 --> 43:04.014
We'll stay close
to the shore,

43:04.049 --> 43:05.279
and we'll keep it
in our sights.

43:05.317 --> 43:07.347
I don't think
you understand.

43:07.386 --> 43:10.386
There are sharks, plural!

43:11.757 --> 43:13.287
Wait, are you sure?

43:13.325 --> 43:15.025
Yeah, I've been
watching them

43:15.060 --> 43:16.730
swim in and out all day.

43:16.762 --> 43:19.002
How many?

43:19.031 --> 43:21.831
I don't know. Five or six.
What does it matter?

43:21.867 --> 43:24.527
Okay, we'll just stay close,

43:24.569 --> 43:26.739
and if we have to bail,
we have to bail.

43:26.772 --> 43:28.372
We'll keep it in our sights.

43:30.075 --> 43:31.735
This is a horrible idea.

43:31.777 --> 43:33.577
Yeah. The worst.

43:33.612 --> 43:35.412
Are you coming?

43:35.447 --> 43:39.417
No. No!

43:39.451 --> 43:40.851
Suit yourself.

43:45.590 --> 43:47.690
Wait, you can't
just leave me here.

43:49.928 --> 43:51.058
I'm going this way.

43:51.096 --> 43:53.396
If you want to come,
you come.

43:53.432 --> 43:55.132
If you want to stay,
that's your choice.

44:00.038 --> 44:02.368
All right, all right.
I'm coming.

44:03.608 --> 44:04.708
Welcome aboard.

44:08.113 --> 44:10.813
This is crazy.
God.

44:16.488 --> 44:17.548
Take this.

44:19.124 --> 44:20.794
Do you know
what you're doing?

44:20.826 --> 44:22.386
I've done it.

44:31.136 --> 44:33.066
Come on, now.
You can do it.

44:33.105 --> 44:36.805
You're doing great.
We're almost there!

44:36.842 --> 44:38.242
Keep rowing.
You're doing good.

44:38.276 --> 44:39.576
<i>Come on, Diane!</i>

44:44.516 --> 44:45.946
Rick!

44:45.984 --> 44:48.424
Focus on the shore.
You're doing great!

44:50.856 --> 44:54.716
Focus! Focus!
Keep going!

44:54.760 --> 44:55.660
<i>You're doing great!</i>

44:58.196 --> 45:01.496
We're almost there.
Focus on the shore!

45:01.533 --> 45:03.803
<i>Row, baby!
Come on, row!</i>

45:17.182 --> 45:19.982
You got it!
You got it!

45:20.018 --> 45:22.518
You got it!
You got the shark!

45:36.034 --> 45:37.704
Mom, are you okay?

45:37.736 --> 45:39.796
I'm fine. Your father...

45:41.907 --> 45:43.637
<i>That's a lot of blood.</i>

45:43.675 --> 45:45.175
Dad, what happened?

45:45.210 --> 45:47.680
I'm okay.
It looks worse than it is.

45:47.712 --> 45:49.512
Really? Because
it looks really bad.

45:49.548 --> 45:51.478
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Go ahead.

45:57.689 --> 45:59.489
Thanks.

46:08.099 --> 46:10.529
What is going on?

46:10.569 --> 46:11.839
Sharks, ma'am.

46:15.941 --> 46:17.341
Where's your brother?

46:20.212 --> 46:21.742
Molly!

46:21.780 --> 46:22.950
He went looking for you.

46:37.095 --> 46:39.025
<i>Hey, you doing okay?</i>

46:39.064 --> 46:40.364
Peachy.

46:44.102 --> 46:48.242
I'm sorry about
your friends.

46:48.273 --> 46:49.413
Thanks.

46:49.441 --> 46:51.771
I'm sorry about
your Grandma.

46:51.810 --> 46:52.780
Yeah.

46:52.811 --> 46:54.881
<i>I did this.</i>

46:54.913 --> 46:57.753
My friends were throwing
fireworks in the water.

46:57.782 --> 47:02.752
They woke it up,
pissed it off.

47:02.787 --> 47:06.387
<i>No, you know,
that thing's a wild animal.</i>

47:06.424 --> 47:08.424
It runs on instinct.

47:08.460 --> 47:11.430
It's a force of nature.
It's primal.

47:11.463 --> 47:15.733
You can't... you can't
blame yourself for it.

47:15.767 --> 47:17.597
That's what a crazy
old guy with a gun

47:17.636 --> 47:19.436
told me earlier today,
anyway.

47:19.471 --> 47:22.611
Yeah, maybe not, but four
people are dead because of me.

47:22.641 --> 47:25.611
And now how many more
are going to die?

47:25.644 --> 47:27.984
We're not going to
let them, all right?

47:28.013 --> 47:29.013
I promise.

47:37.522 --> 47:39.492
Here.

47:39.524 --> 47:41.934
Thanks.
Thanks, babe.

47:43.495 --> 47:45.995
Some vacation?

47:46.031 --> 47:48.001
<i>Anything, Molls?</i>

47:48.033 --> 47:49.673
He's not answering.

47:49.701 --> 47:52.341
<i>I'm sure he's fine, though.</i>

47:52.370 --> 47:54.640
Harrison's a smart guy.

47:54.673 --> 47:57.013
Are we talking about that
lanky fellow from earlier

47:57.042 --> 47:59.442
with the cherry popsicle?

47:59.477 --> 48:01.537
I respectfully disagree.

48:05.183 --> 48:06.323
We'll find him.

48:06.351 --> 48:09.051
Molly, where's your grandma?

48:13.692 --> 48:18.632
She...
She's gone, Mom.

48:20.231 --> 48:22.731
The shark...
I was too late.

48:26.004 --> 48:29.874
Yeah, real sad stuff.

48:29.908 --> 48:30.868
Gone too soon.

48:34.212 --> 48:37.182
May she rest in peace.

48:37.215 --> 48:39.215
Enough said.

48:39.250 --> 48:44.390
We are burning
daylight here.

48:44.422 --> 48:46.822
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

48:46.858 --> 48:48.928
This is Jones.

48:52.230 --> 48:55.870
The bait shop attendant?

48:55.900 --> 49:00.370
Don't worry. I know these
woods better than anybody.

49:00.405 --> 49:02.705
We'll circle back around
with Big Betty,

49:02.741 --> 49:07.011
get the drop on those
sharks, and find your boy.

49:10.915 --> 49:13.215
Look, I do not think that
we should be following

49:13.251 --> 49:14.721
some bait shop attendant.

49:14.753 --> 49:16.553
He already killed
two sharks,

49:16.588 --> 49:19.688
and in, like, really,
really cool ways.

49:19.724 --> 49:21.894
Ma'am, with all due respect,

49:21.926 --> 49:26.256
you do not want anyone else
leading you out here today.

49:26.297 --> 49:31.027
No shark is going to
tango with my girl.

49:34.773 --> 49:37.343
-I think we should follow him.
-Yep, me, too.

49:37.375 --> 49:39.575
Let's do it.

49:41.279 --> 49:44.549
Now that that's settled...

49:47.285 --> 49:50.145
first we'll move north.

50:08.440 --> 50:10.810
I'm coming, Jones!
I'm coming!

50:13.311 --> 50:15.611
<i>Jones! ¦</i>

50:17.615 --> 50:18.775
Jones!

50:20.285 --> 50:21.245
Reach out!

50:21.286 --> 50:23.486
No! Jones!
Jones! Jones!

50:37.335 --> 50:38.935
What do we do now?

50:57.422 --> 50:59.022
-Hey, easy.
-I'm okay.

51:00.859 --> 51:03.029
Harrison's not here.

51:15.373 --> 51:17.613
Dad.

51:19.677 --> 51:23.307
Dad, I'm so sorry
about Grandma. I...

51:23.348 --> 51:24.848
It's okay.
It's okay, Molly.

51:24.883 --> 51:27.323
It's not your fault.

51:27.352 --> 51:28.822
We can't worry
about that right now.

51:28.853 --> 51:31.193
Let's just focus on
finding your brother.

51:31.222 --> 51:33.062
Harrison...

51:39.464 --> 51:41.934
<i>He said he was going to</i>

51:41.966 --> 51:43.626
<i>drive around the lake
to try to find you.</i>

51:45.870 --> 51:48.170
Harrison wouldn't go out
on the water, would he?

51:48.206 --> 51:50.366
I don't think so.

51:56.181 --> 51:58.711
-No.
-Mom, what?

52:01.386 --> 52:03.146
What was that?

52:03.188 --> 52:04.388
We're out on the water.

52:05.490 --> 52:07.860
Mom! Mom, come on!
We got to go!

52:12.530 --> 52:14.430
Mom! Mom!
You got to come on!

52:19.103 --> 52:21.103
Yeah! Hit it harder!

52:24.909 --> 52:28.379
Hit it harder! Stab it...
stab it! Use both hands!

52:28.413 --> 52:30.583
-Use both hands!
-Just stop helping!

52:30.615 --> 52:32.915
Yeah, you're right.
Sorry.

52:32.951 --> 52:34.951
Rick!

52:40.258 --> 52:41.118
Come on.

52:46.598 --> 52:47.758
Yeah, there you go.

52:47.799 --> 52:49.569
-Watch out!
-Watch out!

52:49.601 --> 52:51.101
What the hell is that?

52:51.135 --> 52:53.135
2500 volts of punishment.

53:08.119 --> 53:09.889
Nice!

53:15.293 --> 53:18.433
How shocking.

53:18.463 --> 53:19.703
Curtis,
stop making jokes!

53:19.731 --> 53:22.771
What?

53:22.800 --> 53:26.440
Sorry, it's just
my best friend's missing.

53:26.471 --> 53:28.441
I just saw a guy
get his arm bitten off.

53:28.473 --> 53:30.913
Sorry, I just make jokes
to deal with it.

53:33.177 --> 53:34.607
Yeah, I'm sorry.

53:34.646 --> 53:36.806
Come on.
Let's go find Harrison.

54:03.975 --> 54:06.475
Wait, hold on.
I don't see it anymore.

54:06.511 --> 54:07.781
Give it a minute.

54:09.514 --> 54:11.114
I'm not seeing anything.

54:11.149 --> 54:13.319
It's okay. We're almost
to the river now.

54:13.351 --> 54:14.481
It's a straight shot
from here.

54:14.519 --> 54:16.649
-You sure?
-Yeah.

54:16.688 --> 54:19.688
<i>I think
it's coming back up.</i>

54:19.724 --> 54:22.194
Wait. I think
that's something else.

54:22.226 --> 54:24.856
Hold on.
I'm going to get it.

54:33.237 --> 54:35.967
Mom! Dad!

54:38.376 --> 54:39.676
Maybe it's not theirs.

54:39.711 --> 54:41.311
No, I didn't get
their fast enough!

54:41.346 --> 54:44.676
We don't know anything yet!
They could still be alive.

54:44.716 --> 54:48.216
Look, hey, you're no
good to them like this.

54:48.252 --> 54:53.522
Let's just
keep moving, okay?

54:53.558 --> 54:56.358
Yeah, you're right.

54:56.394 --> 54:58.264
Come on, let's go.

55:10.575 --> 55:11.835
Thanks.

55:20.952 --> 55:23.252
He's not here.

55:23.287 --> 55:24.287
Harrison!

55:26.290 --> 55:27.690
Harrison!

55:30.428 --> 55:32.698
Right here.
This way.

55:34.132 --> 55:35.062
Be careful, Moll.

55:37.435 --> 55:40.565
<i>Harrison! Harrison!</i>

55:40.605 --> 55:42.035
There was somebody
down here!

55:45.943 --> 55:47.413
Do you think he crossed it?

55:47.445 --> 55:49.205
Maybe.

55:49.247 --> 55:51.407
Got to be a reason he didn't
double back to the car.

55:51.449 --> 55:53.279
<i>Or he was never here.</i>

55:53.317 --> 55:57.417
What?
I'm sure he's fine, y'all.

55:57.455 --> 55:59.215
He's not even
around here anyways.

55:59.257 --> 56:02.087
He's probably with the bikini
babes over at the fireworks show

56:02.126 --> 56:05.586
while we're running around here like
a bunch of idiots in the woods.

56:05.630 --> 56:07.400
Fireworks show?

56:07.432 --> 56:12.132
We saw it driving in. There
will be a crowd there...

56:12.170 --> 56:13.900
people in the water.

56:13.938 --> 56:17.068
They'll be
completely exposed.

56:19.444 --> 56:21.644
We have to warn them.

57:08.593 --> 57:10.863
Sheriff's office.
What's your emergency?

57:10.895 --> 57:14.555
Hey, yeah, there are a bunch
of sharks in the water.

57:14.599 --> 57:17.569
-You again.
-Yes, it is me again.

57:17.602 --> 57:20.072
Look, please, just don't
hang up on me, okay?

57:20.104 --> 57:23.414
Listen, because you
ignored me last time,

57:23.441 --> 57:25.571
two people have died,
all right?

57:25.610 --> 57:27.580
Now, you need
to get out here

57:27.612 --> 57:28.942
because there are sharks
in the water eating people

57:28.980 --> 57:31.080
<i>and you need
to get them out.</i>

57:31.115 --> 57:34.915
You got a real sick
sense of humor, son.

57:34.952 --> 57:37.592
I'm not joking
with you, okay?

57:37.622 --> 57:39.262
Look, my name is Curtis,

57:39.290 --> 57:42.590
and I'm going to be at the
fireworks festival, all right?

57:42.627 --> 57:45.757
You come down here,
you can arrest me yourself.

57:45.796 --> 57:48.026
That's a mighty
tempting offer.

57:48.065 --> 57:50.125
So you're coming?

57:50.168 --> 57:52.328
I'm leaving right now.

57:55.473 --> 57:57.613
What did he say?

57:57.642 --> 57:59.612
I think I got
through to him.

57:59.644 --> 58:01.484
Another prank call?

58:01.512 --> 58:04.112
<i>It's kind of weird.</i>

59:04.375 --> 59:06.605
Addy!

59:06.644 --> 59:08.314
Come.

59:26.564 --> 59:29.004
Let's get you set up, okay?

59:44.448 --> 59:46.078
Sheriff's office.

59:46.117 --> 59:48.747
Hi, Susan.

59:48.786 --> 59:50.716
No. Tiger hasn't been by.
He's off today.

59:50.755 --> 59:53.415
He's working
the festival tonight.

59:53.457 --> 59:54.757
Well, you know him.

59:54.792 --> 59:56.692
He just probably snuck
off down to the river.

59:56.727 --> 01:00:00.757
Been talking about buying those
new flies for a day or so.

01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:02.728
<i>I wouldn't worry about it.</i>

01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:04.927
<i>No problem.
I will keep a look out.</i>

01:00:07.438 --> 01:00:11.038
Susan can't get in touch with
Tiger. Should I call him?

01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:13.875
Let the man fish in piece.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:23.592
You missed the turn!

01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:25.251
The festival's that way!

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:28.419
We're making
a quick stop first!

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:29.929
-Wait, is it...
-Yep.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.260
Sweet! You guys are going
to love this place.

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:33.756
It's got, like,
all these awesome weapons

01:00:33.798 --> 01:00:35.058
like a double-bladed
katana, and, like...

01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:36.569
They're going
to see it, hon.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.100
Yeah, you're
going to see it.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.565
It's like a playground
for psycho killers,

01:00:40.604 --> 01:00:43.244
or, like, if you're trying
to kill a bunch of sharks.

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.520
Check it out,
check it out, check it out!

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:15.641
I know that man
saved our lives,

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:17.343
and I will be
forever grateful,

01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:21.035
but there was something
very wrong with him.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.110
Do we really need
all of this?

01:01:25.149 --> 01:01:27.979
<i>I mean, the police
are on their way.</i>

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:29.548
Bullets won't be enough.

01:01:32.556 --> 01:01:33.856
We need more.

01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:36.291
<i>Well, this is
certainly more.</i>

01:01:48.706 --> 01:01:51.566
-Darling.
-Yeah?

01:01:58.048 --> 01:01:59.578
I think I found
something we can use.

01:02:03.888 --> 01:02:06.318
Yeah, that'll work.

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:19.755
It's not safe
in the water. Sorry.

01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:22.257
Just go find your mom.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:23.499
We need to warn
these people now.

01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:37.411
Mommy! Mommy!
They grabbed me!

01:03:40.451 --> 01:03:41.681
Shark!

01:03:46.123 --> 01:03:48.163
In the water!

01:03:48.192 --> 01:03:49.392
Come on,
you got to get out!

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:50.326
Get out!

01:03:54.598 --> 01:03:56.398
Did they say "shark"?

01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:57.803
Damn, I thought that
was going to work.

01:03:57.835 --> 01:03:59.125
That usually works
in movies.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:00.899
-They don't believe us.
-Would you?

01:04:00.938 --> 01:04:03.468
-Probably not.
-Yeah.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:05.507
We need to get these
people out of here somehow.

01:04:05.543 --> 01:04:06.443
Yeah, but how?

01:04:41.445 --> 01:04:43.205
Come on, quick!
Before it comes back!

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:44.677
-Go!
-My God!

01:04:44.715 --> 01:04:45.875
Come on!

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.076
Jump in the water!
Come on, swim!

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:54.822
-Swim!
-Come on!

01:04:54.858 --> 01:04:57.888
Come on! Come on!
Come on.

01:04:57.928 --> 01:04:59.188
Easy.

01:05:05.936 --> 01:05:07.236
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:05:07.271 --> 01:05:09.101
<i>Come on!
You can do this!</i>

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:11.239
-Come on!
-Come on!

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:19.405
Come on! Come on!

01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:20.750
Come on,
come on, come on.

01:05:20.784 --> 01:05:21.654
Go!

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:27.790
<i>-It's coming, Jennifer!
-It's coming!</i>

01:05:34.832 --> 01:05:36.672
<i>Come on.</i>

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:43.110
-Come on! Come on!
-I'm so scared!

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.470
-Relax. I got you.
-I'm so scared.

01:05:45.509 --> 01:05:47.139
I got you. I'm trying...
Get your leg up.

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:55.152
Come on!

01:05:55.185 --> 01:05:57.845
-Help!
-Come on! Come on!

01:06:07.965 --> 01:06:10.665
You're welcome!

01:06:10.701 --> 01:06:12.971
Come on. You okay?

01:06:13.003 --> 01:06:16.573
<i>-Yeah.
-Nicely done.</i>

01:06:16.607 --> 01:06:19.467
I hold a grudge.

01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:21.440
I'll remember
not to tick you off

01:06:25.816 --> 01:06:27.946
I know you've just, like,
been through some stuff,

01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:31.945
but I was thinking we could,
like... movies or bowling?

01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:34.459
I don't know. What do you
have around here to do?

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:36.291
No.

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:49.909
Molly?

01:06:51.575 --> 01:06:53.635
Mom! Dad!

01:07:03.921 --> 01:07:05.321
No, boy.

01:07:08.926 --> 01:07:13.026
<i>-Yo. ¦
-Dude!</i>

01:07:13.063 --> 01:07:15.033
-You live!
-Shark proof, baby.

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:17.665
Me, too.
Well, Molly helped.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:19.841
Yeah, she like shot it
with this crazy thing.

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:23.710
It's outfitted to shoot weaponized
deer antlers or something.

01:07:23.741 --> 01:07:25.641
Where did you get
that by the way?

01:07:25.676 --> 01:07:27.706
<i>Well... ¦ Dude, you
missed all of it.</i>

01:07:27.745 --> 01:07:31.005
Like, dude, Jones' workshop
had amazing weapons.

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:35.748
<i>There was... there's a double
bladed samurai sword!</i>

01:07:35.786 --> 01:07:38.916
His guns have guns.
It was pretty awesome.

01:07:38.956 --> 01:07:39.886
Where's Jones?

01:07:44.428 --> 01:07:47.058
Mr. Jones? The guy who
runs the bait shop?

01:07:47.097 --> 01:07:48.327
It's just Jones.

01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:52.525
Yeah, well,
it was anyways.

01:07:58.275 --> 01:07:59.535
Hello.

01:08:00.444 --> 01:08:03.954
How are you?
Bikini babe?

01:08:03.981 --> 01:08:06.851
Bikini babe?

01:08:06.884 --> 01:08:09.754
Yeah. This is Dawn.

01:08:09.787 --> 01:08:12.047
Dawn, this used to be
my friend, Curtis.

01:08:14.224 --> 01:08:15.564
<i>Help!</i>

01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:22.197
Help! Somebody help me!

01:08:22.232 --> 01:08:24.002
Please, somebody help me!

01:08:27.004 --> 01:08:28.073
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:32.609
Help, please!
Please, somebody!

01:08:32.643 --> 01:08:35.983
It's too fast.
I can't get it from here.

01:08:36.013 --> 01:08:37.483
What if we lure it this way,

01:08:37.514 --> 01:08:39.814
and then she'll have enough
time to get to the dock?

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:41.120
Please, somebody help me!

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:42.451
<i>Can you lure him in?</i>

01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:44.286
-Yeah.
-All right.

01:08:44.321 --> 01:08:45.991
Let's get
as close as we can.

01:08:46.023 --> 01:08:48.292
Help!
Someone help me, please!

01:08:48.325 --> 01:08:51.285
Lure a shark in.
Just lure it in.

01:08:51.328 --> 01:08:52.758
It's all you, bud.

01:09:07.044 --> 01:09:09.384
Babe. Babe,
where you are going?

01:09:12.049 --> 01:09:15.779
I have an idea.

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:21.660
Help, please!

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:30.872
What is he doing?

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:35.974
I think I know.

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:41.642
I'm going fishing, bro.
Be the bait.

01:09:44.381 --> 01:09:45.680
I got you.

01:09:45.716 --> 01:09:47.345
Wait. You're going
along with this?

01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:48.684
He's got a good idea.

01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:50.189
That guy has a good idea?

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.689
We're going to find out.

01:09:51.721 --> 01:09:53.892
-Come on. Hey!
-Somebody help me!

01:09:53.924 --> 01:09:56.694
-Help!
-Come on!

01:10:07.905 --> 01:10:10.105
I can't catch his attention.
Somebody give me a hand.

01:10:16.914 --> 01:10:18.984
What is wrong with you?
Why would you do that?

01:10:19.016 --> 01:10:23.016
-You said you needed it.
-Come on! Okay.

01:10:26.256 --> 01:10:27.786
Come on!

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.060
Come on,
you son of a fish!

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:40.536
It's coming!

01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:47.108
Okay, okay.
Here it comes, Curtis.

01:10:47.144 --> 01:10:48.544
Here it comes,
Curtis.

01:10:54.217 --> 01:10:55.877
Here he comes!

01:10:57.821 --> 01:10:58.721
Perfect!

01:11:08.165 --> 01:11:11.095
Come on now!
Jump! Jump!

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:16.137
I got it.

01:11:16.173 --> 01:11:18.143
Yes! I got it!

01:11:18.175 --> 01:11:19.835
I shot it! Okay.

01:11:25.849 --> 01:11:26.879
Chipper!

01:11:26.917 --> 01:11:28.577
Turn it on.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.590
Okay.

01:11:41.932 --> 01:11:43.672
Jump! Now! Jump!

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:46.500
Come on!
You can swim to me!

01:11:46.536 --> 01:11:49.296
<i>Come on! Do it!
You can do it!</i>

01:11:49.339 --> 01:11:51.509
<i>Swim to me!
Just jump!</i>

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:58.880
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes! Yes!

01:12:16.366 --> 01:12:19.666
Yeah!

01:12:19.703 --> 01:12:22.203
<i>All right,
now is the time!</i>

01:12:22.239 --> 01:12:24.809
You can do it!
Yeah! Swim!

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.741
<i>Go, go, go!
Right to me!</i>

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:31.245
<i>Swim! Almost!
Come on, now!</i>

01:12:37.988 --> 01:12:38.948
Almost there.

01:12:38.989 --> 01:12:40.359
Almost there.
Give me your hand.

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:42.020
Yeah. Way to go!
Way to go!

01:12:53.403 --> 01:12:56.173
Take that, mother nature!

01:12:57.908 --> 01:13:01.838
<i>I just killed a shark!
I just killed a shark.</i>

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:04.848
Who saved the day?
This guy right here.

01:13:10.587 --> 01:13:13.087
Man.

01:13:13.123 --> 01:13:14.023
Curtis!

01:13:18.462 --> 01:13:22.362
Curtis!

01:13:28.105 --> 01:13:31.405
Hey, you're going
to be all right, man.

01:13:31.441 --> 01:13:33.741
So not fair.

01:13:33.777 --> 01:13:37.107
I'm not even in the water.

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:40.217
It worked? My plan?

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.120
-Yeah, it did, buddy.
-It really worked.

01:13:42.152 --> 01:13:43.052
Yeah.

01:13:45.422 --> 01:13:47.822
Molly! Come here!

01:13:49.559 --> 01:13:52.889
-Come on!
-Hey, Harrison...

01:13:59.636 --> 01:14:02.296
-Hey, baby.
-Molls.

01:14:02.339 --> 01:14:03.769
Hi. Okay.

01:14:03.807 --> 01:14:06.307
<i>It's okay.
Stay with me.</i>

01:14:06.343 --> 01:14:08.313
I thought
I was going to make it.

01:14:08.345 --> 01:14:10.105
No, no. no. It's okay.

01:14:10.147 --> 01:14:12.777
We're going to get you help.
It's okay.

01:14:12.816 --> 01:14:15.746
I got to shoot
the harpoon cannon.

01:14:19.022 --> 01:14:20.762
Is he okay?

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:23.925
You did, baby.

01:14:29.199 --> 01:14:32.769
-Hey, Moll?
-Yeah?

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:41.135
Go get 'em.

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:06.197
-Molly.
-No. Come on.

01:15:06.236 --> 01:15:08.296
-No!
-Come on.

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:25.153
Molly?

01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:32.427
Where are you going?

01:15:36.733 --> 01:15:38.003
You heard him.

01:15:42.739 --> 01:15:45.369
Someone should
go talk to her.

01:15:45.408 --> 01:15:46.868
I'll go.

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:49.240
II should do it.

01:15:49.279 --> 01:15:53.179
It should be me.
I'll make sure she's okay.

01:15:56.586 --> 01:15:58.346
Do you want me
to go with you?

01:16:03.093 --> 01:16:05.063
Thank you for
keeping him safe.

01:16:05.095 --> 01:16:07.725
Yeah, thanks.
Nice to meet you.

01:16:07.764 --> 01:16:10.034
I wish it was under
better circumstances.

01:16:12.769 --> 01:16:14.569
We should call someone.

01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:16.744
I don't have a phone.

01:16:16.773 --> 01:16:19.473
Well, let's find
someone who does.

01:16:22.646 --> 01:16:24.446
Come on!

01:16:24.481 --> 01:16:25.881
Come on, I'm right here!

01:16:32.622 --> 01:16:34.292
Come on!
Come and get me!

01:16:34.324 --> 01:16:36.594
-Molly.
-Come on!

01:16:36.626 --> 01:16:38.286
<i>Hey.</i>

01:16:38.328 --> 01:16:39.888
-Come on!
-Easy.

01:16:43.633 --> 01:16:45.403
Harrison,
he's getting away.

01:16:48.638 --> 01:16:51.468
Let it.
We're safe now.

01:16:51.508 --> 01:16:52.938
There's just one left.

01:16:52.976 --> 01:16:54.776
Everybody's out
of the water.

01:16:54.811 --> 01:16:56.481
I need to go after it.

01:16:56.513 --> 01:16:59.253
No, you don't.

01:17:02.352 --> 01:17:03.352
Curtis is dead.

01:17:07.524 --> 01:17:09.324
I know.

01:17:09.359 --> 01:17:12.159
Jones is dead.

01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:17.929
Grandma is dead.

01:17:21.638 --> 01:17:23.098
I need to end this.

01:17:26.176 --> 01:17:27.936
It's not our fight, Molly.

01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:30.949
Isn't it?

01:17:40.357 --> 01:17:41.957
Are we really going
to do this?

01:17:44.027 --> 01:17:46.457
I learned from the best.

01:17:46.496 --> 01:17:48.556
All right, just watch where
you point that thing.

01:17:51.901 --> 01:17:56.041
Okay, let's go.

01:18:00.877 --> 01:18:03.537
All right, there's only
one shark left, right?

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:05.550
Yeah, but it's the big one.

01:18:05.582 --> 01:18:07.012
What's the plan?

01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:09.550
Remember that other thing
that Curtis mentioned?

01:18:09.586 --> 01:18:11.016
Yeah.

01:18:11.054 --> 01:18:15.994
Well, this is
that other thing.

01:18:18.728 --> 01:18:20.698
How do you know
that even works?

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:23.000
Well, we'll find out.

01:18:26.269 --> 01:18:27.369
She's hungry?

01:18:27.404 --> 01:18:28.604
We'll give her
something to chew on.

01:18:31.408 --> 01:18:34.408
So, we're going to
throw garbage at it?

01:18:34.444 --> 01:18:36.214
What's the plan?
Like, pollute the lake

01:18:36.246 --> 01:18:38.946
and wait for it to die
of natural causes?

01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:43.720
What is this thing
supposed to fire?

01:18:43.753 --> 01:18:45.353
Anything you can fit in it.

01:18:52.762 --> 01:18:55.632
They want a show,
let's give them a show.

01:18:58.802 --> 01:19:00.902
-You got a cell?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:02.367
We got to call 911.

01:19:06.943 --> 01:19:08.243
Sheriff's office.
Hold, please.

01:19:08.278 --> 01:19:10.278
Sheriff's office.
Hold, please.

01:19:10.313 --> 01:19:11.753
Yes, ma'am,
I understand.

01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:14.621
We are taking this
very seriously.

01:19:14.651 --> 01:19:17.151
Wait, how many sharks?

01:19:20.290 --> 01:19:24.760
Hold, please.
Sheriff's office.

01:19:24.794 --> 01:19:26.094
Yes, sir.
We're on our way.

01:19:26.129 --> 01:19:28.629
Please hold.
Sheriff's office.

01:19:28.665 --> 01:19:31.665
Please hold.
Sheriff's office.

01:19:37.974 --> 01:19:39.144
Harrison.

01:19:42.679 --> 01:19:43.639
Boom.

01:19:52.822 --> 01:19:55.662
Come on, you stupid fish.

01:19:55.692 --> 01:19:58.192
He's not falling for it.

01:20:00.163 --> 01:20:02.263
You think you can hit him
from here or what?

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:04.498
No.

01:20:04.534 --> 01:20:07.674
Well, I guess that's it.

01:20:07.704 --> 01:20:10.074
I just need to get closer.

01:20:10.106 --> 01:20:12.336
Closer?
There is no closer.

01:20:12.375 --> 01:20:15.135
This is as close
as we get. That's it.

01:20:15.178 --> 01:20:17.178
<i>There.</i>

01:20:17.213 --> 01:20:19.683
Out there?
Are you crazy?

01:20:19.716 --> 01:20:21.316
No, you can't go out
on that float.

01:20:21.351 --> 01:20:23.821
-You'll be a sitting duck.
-I don't care.

01:20:23.853 --> 01:20:25.153
Okay, then I'll go.

01:20:25.188 --> 01:20:26.818
No. No.
This was my plan.

01:20:26.856 --> 01:20:28.986
Nobody else is dying
for me today.

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:30.525
Yeah, well, I'm not
letting you die either.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.460
Please, Harrison, just...

01:20:35.865 --> 01:20:37.325
Okay, then we both go.

01:20:37.367 --> 01:20:40.127
No, I need you here in
case something goes wrong.

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:42.339
Really? You think you're
going to convince me

01:20:42.372 --> 01:20:44.542
by reminding me that
things could go wrong?

01:20:44.574 --> 01:20:47.014
Harrison.

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:48.643
We both go.

01:20:51.748 --> 01:20:55.378
-Fine. Fine.
-Okay.

01:20:55.418 --> 01:20:58.188
Okay. Okay.

01:21:03.893 --> 01:21:05.033
Wait.

01:21:05.061 --> 01:21:07.191
Grab the other box
of mortars.

01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:08.530
You don't think
we have enough?

01:21:08.565 --> 01:21:10.695
Just in case.

01:21:10.733 --> 01:21:12.273
Okay.

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:18.510
Molly!

01:21:20.543 --> 01:21:23.583
<i>-Just watch my back.
-Come on!</i>

01:21:23.613 --> 01:21:25.083
You're so stupid.

01:21:25.114 --> 01:21:28.754
You're so...
Please be careful.

01:21:34.624 --> 01:21:36.394
-Sheriff's office.
-There are shark attacks at the lake.

01:21:36.426 --> 01:21:38.386
You need to get
down here now.

01:21:38.428 --> 01:21:40.698
Yes, sir. We're on our way.
Hold please.

01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:44.800
How much longer until
you're... she hung up on me.

01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:08.660
I don't see him anywhere!

01:22:20.837 --> 01:22:21.837
Do you see him?

01:22:29.512 --> 01:22:31.812
Molly!

01:22:31.848 --> 01:22:32.848
Call them back!

01:22:35.585 --> 01:22:37.515
No, no!

01:22:39.856 --> 01:22:42.316
I lost the lighter!

01:22:42.358 --> 01:22:45.688
Molly, just forget it.
You need to come back.

01:22:47.263 --> 01:22:49.863
Find me another!

01:22:54.971 --> 01:22:56.771
Molly, look out!

01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:04.110
Harrison, I need that lighter!
Find me a lighter!

01:23:04.147 --> 01:23:05.607
We need to find a lighter.

01:23:07.183 --> 01:23:09.623
I have one!
I have one!

01:23:11.721 --> 01:23:15.561
Molly! Heads up!

01:23:18.728 --> 01:23:19.628
Thanks, Dad.

01:23:29.572 --> 01:23:32.712
Molly, what are you
waiting for? Do it!

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:53.487
Should have stayed
in the ocean, bitch.

01:24:28.798 --> 01:24:29.958
Yeah!

01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:57.390
-Way to go!
-Thanks.

01:24:58.828 --> 01:25:01.428
Okay, sis!

01:25:01.464 --> 01:25:04.104
Ozark code... that which
nature does not provide,

01:25:04.133 --> 01:25:05.433
you devise.

01:25:05.468 --> 01:25:06.968
Nice shooting, sweetheart.

01:25:07.003 --> 01:25:09.273
Thanks, Dad.
