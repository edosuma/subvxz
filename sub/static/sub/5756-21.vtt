00:01.769 --> 00:03.035
<i> PREVIOUSLY ON</i>
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:04.805 --> 00:06.538
THEY SERVED
A SEARCH WARRANT.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.108
MAKE THEM GET OUT.
I CAN'T.

00:09.110 --> 00:12.277
YOU'RE PERSON OF INTEREST
IN A MURDER INVESTIGATION.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.780
GARRETT?

00:14.782 --> 00:15.647
YOU'RE A COP NOW?

00:18.119 --> 00:22.354
I WAS...
NOT EXPECTING THAT.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.555
ME NEITHER.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.357
I HAD AN AMAZING
TIME LAST NIGHT,

00:25.359 --> 00:28.127
AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO KEEP SEEING YOU.

00:28.129 --> 00:31.096
LIKE THIS? ALWAYS
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE?

00:31.098 --> 00:33.332
SO WHO IS IT?
SOMEBODY NEW?

00:33.334 --> 00:34.833
SOMEBODY I KNOW?

00:34.835 --> 00:37.002
I THINK I'M GONNA
HAVE TO START LOOKING
IN THE HALLWAYS

00:37.004 --> 00:38.337
TO SEE IF I CAN GUESS
WHO IT IS.

00:38.339 --> 00:39.772
YOU WERE SPYING ON ME,
THE WHOLE TIME.

00:39.774 --> 00:41.707
NOT THE WHOLE TIME.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.609
DON'T TOUCH ME.
( weeping )

00:43.611 --> 00:46.045
<i> THEY FOUND SOME FIBERS...</i>

00:46.047 --> 00:47.679
SOME THREADS
CAUGHT IN A BRACELET.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.314
THE ONE ALISON GAVE US?

00:49.316 --> 00:51.483
I THINK SOMEONE'S GOING
TO A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE

00:51.485 --> 00:52.518
TO MAKE YOU LOOK GUILTY.

01:03.664 --> 01:06.498
DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY
RUBBED THAT SWEATER
ON YOUR BRACELET?

01:06.500 --> 01:07.966
SOMEBODY? TRY IAN.

01:07.968 --> 01:11.136
HE'S DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN
TO MAKE YOU LOOK GUILTY.

01:11.138 --> 01:13.338
YOUR PARENTS SHOULD HIRE YOU
A 24-HOUR BODYGUARD.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.406
WHAT ABOUT JENNA?

01:14.408 --> 01:17.543
WHAT IF SHE PAID CALEB
TO GET THAT BRACELET?

01:17.545 --> 01:19.044
WHEN WAS CALEB
IN SPENCER'S HOUSE?

01:19.046 --> 01:20.479
HE DOESN'T NEED
AN INVITATION, EM.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.848
HE BROKE INTO A VENDING
MACHINE WITH A SPORK.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.216
GUYS...
( bell dings )

01:24.218 --> 01:25.818
I THINK SOMEBODY'S
WATCHING US.

01:28.322 --> 01:31.356
THOSE? THEY'RE FOR
THE FOUNDERS FESTIVAL.

01:31.358 --> 01:34.226
MAN, IF THAT'S WHAT
ROSEWOOD'S FOUNDING
FAMILY LOOKED LIKE,

01:34.228 --> 01:36.028
HOW DID THEY EVER GET
ANYONE TO MOVE HERE?

01:36.030 --> 01:38.630
AND WHY WERE THEY
ALLOWED TO REPRODUCE?

01:38.632 --> 01:39.832
GUYS, IF CALEB WAS--

01:39.834 --> 01:41.867
COULD WE STOP
USING THE "C" WORD?

01:41.869 --> 01:43.769
WE KNOW THIS IS
HARD FOR YOU, OKAY,

01:43.771 --> 01:46.672
BUT WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT CA-- HIM.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.943
IF WE WANT TO HELP SPENCER,

01:50.945 --> 01:53.212
WE HAVE TO KNOW
WHAT CALEB KNOWS.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.247
GUYS, THERE IS DEFINITELY
SOMEBODY OUT THERE.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.082
MAYBE IF EMILY AND I
CORNERED CALEB--

01:57.084 --> 01:59.284
NOT IN SCHOOL,
BUT SOMEWHERE THAT'S
JENNA-FREE.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.986
IF CALEB'S GONNA TALK
TO ANYONE, IT'S GONNA BE ME.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.623
WILL YOU DO IT?

02:04.625 --> 02:06.458
( bell dings )

02:06.460 --> 02:08.460
TO HELP SPENCER, SURE.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.761
THANKS, HANNA.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.041
Hanna: SPENCER?

02:23.043 --> 02:24.409
ARE YOU COMING?
YEAH.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.393
The Pierces:<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET,</i>
<i> CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

02:41.395 --> 02:44.096
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE</i>
<i> YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

02:44.098 --> 02:45.964
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

<i> ¶ TAKING THIS ONE</i>

<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO</i>

02:56.777 --> 02:58.510
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM</i>

03:05.786 --> 03:07.486
WHAT'S THE PURPLE ONE?

03:07.488 --> 03:08.887
FOLIC ACID.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.023
DR. BARONE'S NEW NURSE
CHATTED MY EAR OFF ABOUT IT.

03:11.025 --> 03:15.127
REALLY JUST AN EXCUSE
SO SHE COULD ASK QUESTIONS
ABOUT OUR FAMILY.

03:15.129 --> 03:16.461
WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS?

03:16.463 --> 03:19.431
MOM, EVERYONE IN TOWN'S
TALKING ABOUT US.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.532
THE BRACELET,

03:20.534 --> 03:22.201
THE POLICE MARCHING OUT
OF HERE WITH BAGS.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.503
WHAT DID YOU SAY,
TO THIS NURSE?

03:24.505 --> 03:25.671
NOTHING.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.105
BUT YOU KNOW
THE SECOND I LEFT,

03:27.107 --> 03:29.141
SHE PROBABLY TOLD THE OTHERS
THAT SPENCER WAS GONNA BE

03:29.143 --> 03:30.943
WEARING HANDCUFFS
AT MY BABY SHOWER.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.844
'MORNING, SWEETIE.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.079
YOU WANT SOME YOGURT?

03:34.081 --> 03:35.247
I HAVE--
I HAVE FRESH BERRIES.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.015
NO.
I ALREADY ATE, THANKS.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.653
WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

03:41.655 --> 03:43.388
THE FOUNDERS FESTIVAL.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.123
YOUR SISTER AND IAN
ARE THINKING OF HELPING

03:45.125 --> 03:46.858
MRS. ACKARD
WITH THE CHURCH BOOTH.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.126
FUN.

03:48.128 --> 03:51.230
ACTUALLY,
I'D LIKE YOU TO JOIN THEM.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.098
Melissa: YOU GET ON
MRS. ACKARD'S GOOD SIDE,

03:53.100 --> 03:54.433
AND NO ONE IN TOWN
WOULD...

03:54.435 --> 03:56.168
WHY DO I NEED TO BE
ON HER GOOD SIDE?

03:56.170 --> 03:58.370
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TALKING

03:58.372 --> 04:00.872
AND JUMPING TO
A LOT OF CONCLUSIONS.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.875
( cell phone rings )

04:03.877 --> 04:06.712
IT'S TOBY.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.880
HONEY, I'D PREFER IT
IF YOU'D NOT HAVE
ANY CONTACT WITH HIM

04:08.882 --> 04:10.616
UNTIL THIS SITUATION
IS BEHIND US.

04:10.618 --> 04:14.419
WHY? WHAT DOES TOBY HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?
HE'S A FRIEND.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.521
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL
ABOUT WHO YOU ASSOCIATE WITH.

04:16.523 --> 04:20.492
SO, WHAT? I'M JUST
SUPPOSED TO IGNORE HIM,
NOT SPEAK TO HIM?

04:20.494 --> 04:21.693
YES.

04:21.695 --> 04:22.861
SWEETIE, LISTEN TO ME.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.363
YOU NEED TO BE
AT THE FESTIVAL.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.831
IF YOU'RE NOT,
YOUR NEIGHBORS
ARE GONNA THINK

04:25.833 --> 04:27.065
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO HIDE.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.367
I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHAT MY NEIGHBORS THINK.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.968
THEY'RE NOT JUST
NEIGHBORS, SPENCER,

04:29.970 --> 04:31.370
THEY'RE POTENTIAL JURORS.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.672
AND MOST VERDICTS
ARE DECIDED IN
LIVING ROOMS,

04:33.674 --> 04:35.340
AND TOWN FAIRS.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.843
JUST TAKE TOBY
OUT OF THAT EQUATION, OKAY?

04:54.862 --> 04:56.428
GOOD MORNING.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.899
SO... I HAVE
A MEETING TONIGHT,

05:00.901 --> 05:03.602
BUT DO YOU WANT TO WAIT
SO WE CAN HAVE DINNER
TOGETHER AND...?

05:03.604 --> 05:06.738
I'LL GRAB SOMETHING
AFTER SCHOOL.

05:06.740 --> 05:07.739
OKAY.

05:12.446 --> 05:17.416
DID... CALEB MOVE BACK IN
WITH HIS FOSTER FAMILY?

05:17.418 --> 05:20.319
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHY HE MOVED OUT SO QUICKLY?

05:20.321 --> 05:22.454
THERE'S... NOTHING TO TELL.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.227
( sighs )

05:29.229 --> 05:31.897
LOOK, IF YOU WOULD RATHER
STAY HOME FROM SCHOOL,

05:31.899 --> 05:33.598
HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH DAY...

05:33.600 --> 05:35.000
Mona: KNOCK-KNOCK.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.268
IN HERE, MONA.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.971
'MORNING, MRS. M.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.239
HI.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.908
OOH, CAN I STEAL
SOME OF THAT COFFEE?

05:42.910 --> 05:43.809
SURE.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.583
IS SKETCHY-BOY
GONE FOR GOOD?

05:51.585 --> 05:52.884
YES, MONA, HE'S GONE.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.555
YOU READY?

05:56.557 --> 05:59.091
HANNA, COULD I JUST
SAY SOMETHING?

05:59.093 --> 06:01.293
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

06:01.295 --> 06:02.561
WHAT?

06:02.563 --> 06:04.629
I KNEW HE WAS GONNA
DISAPPOINT YOU
IN A MAJOR WAY,

06:04.631 --> 06:06.998
AND I BLAME MYSELF
FOR NOT STEPPING UP
TO PROTECT YOU.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.301
MONA.
NO, I MEAN IT.

06:09.303 --> 06:10.769
A BIG PART OF ME
NEVER TRUSTED HIM,

06:10.771 --> 06:12.003
AND IF I'D BEEN
A BETTER FRIEND,

06:12.005 --> 06:13.305
I WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM
TO GET LOST

06:13.307 --> 06:14.740
BEFORE HE UNZIPPED
HIS READY DUFFLE BAG.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.944
I HATE SEEING YOU
GET HURT.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.980
WELL, I'M NOT HURT.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.515
CAN WE GO?

06:26.620 --> 06:28.353
( door opens )

06:28.355 --> 06:29.755
( sighs )

06:29.757 --> 06:30.956
( door closes )

06:30.958 --> 06:34.526
( indistinct chatter )

06:34.528 --> 06:35.761
GOT A SECOND?

06:35.763 --> 06:37.963
UM...

06:37.965 --> 06:39.531
SURE.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.000
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HANNA'S TOLD YOU...
EVERYTHING.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.301
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.103
THEN MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.973
SHE'S HAVING A HARD TIME
HEARING HOW SORRY I AM.
( mouthing silently )

06:47.975 --> 06:49.574
SHE WON'T TAKE MY CALLS,

06:49.576 --> 06:51.376
SHE LOOKS THE OTHER WAY
WHENEVER I SEE HER.
CALEB.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.145
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION
WITH HANNA, OKAY?

07:02.456 --> 07:04.055
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:04.057 --> 07:05.690
( giggling )
I GOT 'EM.

07:05.692 --> 07:06.925
I GOT THE TICKETS.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.994
NO WAY! I THOUGHT
THEY WERE SOLD OUT.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.997
MY DAD KNOWS
SOMEBODY AT HOLLIS
WHO WORKS FOR COLLEGE EVENTS.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.065
THAT'S AWESOME.
HOW MUCH WAS IT?

07:14.067 --> 07:16.201
MY TREAT.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.036
ISN'T THAT WHY
THEY CALL IT A DATE?

07:18.038 --> 07:19.404
THOSE TICKETS WERE EXPENSIVE.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.040
EM, I CAN HANDLE
TWO TICKETS.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.376
TROY SATTLER WILL
PAY FOR HIS OWN.

07:24.378 --> 07:27.579
WAIT. TROY SATTLER'S
COMING TOO?

07:27.581 --> 07:31.583
EMILY, YOU KNOW I WANT
TO BE ALONE WITH YOU,

07:31.585 --> 07:33.585
BUT I GOT THE TICKETS
FROM MY DAD,

07:33.587 --> 07:35.587
AND I JUST THOUGHT
IF A GUY CAME ALONG...

07:35.589 --> 07:38.223
I'M NOT PRETENDING
TO DATE TROY.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.892
HE'S JUST, LIKE,
INSURANCE.

07:40.894 --> 07:45.831
LOOK, I REALLY WANT
TO HAVE THAT TALK
WITH MY DAD. I DO.

07:45.833 --> 07:49.534
I EVEN WENT ONLINE
AND LOOKED FOR, LIKE,
WHAT TO SAY.

07:49.536 --> 07:53.038
YOU'RE GONNA COME OUT
TO YOUR PARENTS
THROUGH E-MAIL?

07:53.040 --> 07:54.506
NO.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.642
SHERIDAN PREP HAS
A CAMPUS PRIDE GROUP,

07:57.644 --> 07:59.444
WITH A WEBSITE.

07:59.446 --> 08:00.846
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN GO
TO A MEETING, THOUGH.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.447
THEIR SCHOOL IS, LIKE,
TWO MILES FROM HERE.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.216
THEN MEET SOMEONE
FROM THE GROUP
FOR A COFFEE.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.322
WOULD IT HELP
IF I WENT WITH YOU?

08:26.106 --> 08:27.739
HEY.
HI.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.775
( low )
SO, CAN WE TALK ABOUT
THIS WEEKEND, THE FESTIVAL?

08:30.777 --> 08:32.410
( class bell rings )

08:34.348 --> 08:35.580
I WAS THINK--
( coffee splatters )

08:35.582 --> 08:37.516
OH, GOD!
I AM SO SORRY.
DID I DO THAT?

08:40.487 --> 08:42.420
Aria: UM...

08:42.422 --> 08:43.889
SORRY.

08:43.891 --> 08:47.125
Look, how do you feel
about a stay-at-home
weekend instead,

08:47.127 --> 08:48.860
your place, with me?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.929
Yeah. What's going on?

08:50.931 --> 08:52.330
OH, DID I GET IT
ON YOUR SHOES?

08:52.332 --> 08:53.498
I AM SUCH A SPAZ!

08:53.500 --> 08:57.135
Look, we can just
talk about it later.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.005
Sure. My classroom,
after school.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.139
No, we can't.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.974
Can we just do this
over dinner?

09:02.976 --> 09:04.209
Sure.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.723
MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

09:18.725 --> 09:20.759
UH... NO.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.927
I MEAN, YES, PLEASE.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.233
SO, WE'RE TALKING?

09:28.235 --> 09:29.935
WHAT DOES JENNA WANT?

09:29.937 --> 09:32.470
WHY WAS SHE WILLING
TO PAY YOU TO LIVE
IN MY BASEMENT?

09:32.472 --> 09:34.205
I TOLD YOU,
I GAVE THE MONEY BACK.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.340
WHAT DID SHE
ASK YOU TO DO?

09:35.342 --> 09:37.342
RECORD OUR CONVERSATIONS?

09:37.344 --> 09:39.044
RIFLE THROUGH MY PURSE,

09:39.046 --> 09:42.080
THE DRAWERS IN MY BEDROOM?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.582
WHAT DOES SHE WANT?

09:47.120 --> 09:48.720
A KEY.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.122
SHE OFFERED ME
A LOT OF MONEY
TO LOOK FOR A KEY.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.657
A KEY TO WHAT, MY HOUSE?

09:52.659 --> 09:53.658
I GAVE YOU THAT.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.227
NO.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.698
SHE THINKS THAT YOUR FRIEND,

09:59.700 --> 10:01.533
THE ONE WHO DIED,
MAY HAVE GIVE YOU

10:01.535 --> 10:03.134
OR ONE OF
YOUR GIRLS A KEY.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.736
ALI DIDN'T DIE,
SHE WAS MURDERED.

10:08.542 --> 10:09.741
WHAT KIND OF KEY?

10:09.743 --> 10:10.909
JENNA DIDN'T KNOW.

10:12.746 --> 10:16.247
AND AS SOON AS I REALIZED
SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

10:16.249 --> 10:18.049
I TOLD HER TO BACK OFF.

10:18.051 --> 10:21.119
HANNA, WHAT'S WITH YOU GUYS
AND JENNA CAVANAUGH?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.587
WHY DID SHE NEED ME?

10:22.589 --> 10:24.155
WHY COULDN'T SHE
JUST ASK YOU DIRECTLY?

10:24.157 --> 10:26.725
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DON'T GET
TO ASK QUESTIONS.

10:26.727 --> 10:27.759
WHAT ELSE?

10:29.997 --> 10:31.596
IF I KNEW MORE,
SO WOULD YOU.

10:40.607 --> 10:41.373
I MISS YOU.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.582
YEAH.
YOU'LL GET OVER IT.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.196
OKAY, I'M BACK.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.731
Spencer:<i> HEY,</i>
<i> IS FITZ THERE?</i>

11:06.733 --> 11:08.767
NO, HE GOT PULLED
INTO SOME FACULTY THING,

11:08.769 --> 11:10.869
SO HE TEXTED ME
TO ORDER SOME FOOD.

11:10.871 --> 11:14.139
<i> SO YOU GUYS</i>
<i> ARE STILL TEXTING? WOW.</i>

11:14.141 --> 11:15.707
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
AFTER THAT THING
WITH YOUR MOM...

11:15.709 --> 11:17.142
<i> HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.</i>

11:17.144 --> 11:18.777
IF HE THINKS MY PARENTS
ARE SNIFFING US OUT,

11:18.779 --> 11:21.646
IT'LL JUST MAKE HIM
PARANOID, NOT ROMANTIC.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.314
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

11:23.316 --> 11:26.685
I STILL DON'T KNOW IF
TOBY THINKS I SET HIM UP
WITH THAT SWEATER.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.453
WAIT, YOU HAVEN'T
TALKED TO HIM YET?

11:28.455 --> 11:30.055
<i> NO. HE LEFT ME A MESSAGE</i>

11:30.057 --> 11:32.490
<i> SAYING THAT HE COULDN'T</i>
<i> MEET ME AFTER SCHOOL.</i>

11:32.492 --> 11:34.025
Veronica: SPENCER!

11:34.027 --> 11:35.760
I GOTTA GO.
MY MOM'S CALLING.

11:35.762 --> 11:36.895
<i> OKAY.</i>

11:36.897 --> 11:37.662
BYE.

12:00.987 --> 12:03.922
( cell phone rings )

12:03.924 --> 12:07.425
HELLO?
<i> HEY, IT'S ME.</i>
<i> UH, YEAH, THIS MEETING'S</i>

12:07.427 --> 12:09.394
RUNNING A BIT LONG.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.895
DID YOU ORDER DINNER YET?

12:10.897 --> 12:15.066
UM... YOU KNOW WHAT?
I-I CAN'T STAY.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.068
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.369
NO, NO.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.138
UM, WE'LL JUST--
WE'LL TALK LATER, OKAY?

12:20.140 --> 12:21.039
OKAY.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.558
A KEY? A KEY FOR WHAT?

12:40.560 --> 12:42.560
( sighs )
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.295
WAS IT A KEY
TO ALI'S HOUSE?

12:44.297 --> 12:45.730
HER LOCKER
AT THE TENNIS CLUB?

12:45.732 --> 12:47.132
WHY WOULD JENNA WANT THAT?

12:47.134 --> 12:48.800
WHAT WAS SHE GONNA DO,
SNIFF ALI'S OLD SWEAT SOCKS?

12:48.802 --> 12:50.401
IF JENNA'S "A,"
SHE'S LOOKING FOR

12:50.403 --> 12:52.070
ANY INFORMATION ON US
SHE CAN GET.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.273
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT
HE WENT THROUGH MY CLOSET
AND MY NIGHTSTAND.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.374
WHAT A JERK!

12:56.376 --> 12:58.042
HE'S A TOTAL CREEP.
HE'S AN ANIMAL.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.844
EASY, GUYS.

12:59.846 --> 13:02.647
HE LOOKED THROUGH YOUR STUFF,
HE DIDN'T INVADE POLAND.

13:02.649 --> 13:05.083
WHY ARE YOU STICKING UP
FOR HIM? HE BROKE HER TRUST.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.017
HE WENT BEHIND HER BACK.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.786
HE STUCK HIS HANDS
IN HER PANTY DRAWER!

13:09.823 --> 13:11.556
I'M SORRY.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.691
OKAY, ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT SOMEBODY

13:13.693 --> 13:15.693
CAN LOOK THROUGH
SOMEONE ELSE'S STUFF

13:15.695 --> 13:17.061
THAT THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE LOOKING THROUGH.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.100
YOU WANNA TRANSLATE THAT
INTO SPEECH?

13:22.102 --> 13:25.303
I SAW EZRA'S WEBSITE PAGE.

13:25.305 --> 13:29.274
LOOK, I-I KNOCKED HIS DESK,
AND HIS LAPTOP SCREEN CAME UP.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.642
SO, BIG DEAL.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.510
WHAT'S THE JUICIEST THING
ON HIS STATUS UPDATE?

13:32.512 --> 13:34.979
"EZRA FITS HAS JOINED
THE MARK TWAIN FAN PAGE"?

13:34.981 --> 13:36.881
HOW 'BOUT
HE HAS A DOUBLE LIFE.

13:36.883 --> 13:39.317
WAIT, I THOUGHT THAT<i> YOU</i>
WERE HIS DOUBLE LIFE.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.385
FINE. TRIPLE LIFE.

13:42.389 --> 13:46.057
THERE WAS THIS PICTURE OF HIM
COZYING UP TO SOME GIRL

13:46.059 --> 13:47.659
WEARING AN ENGAGEMENT RING
IN ITALY.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.262
WHAT'S HER NAME?

13:51.264 --> 13:52.764
JACKIE.

13:52.766 --> 13:54.632
HOW DO YOU KNOW
SHE WASN'T HIS COUSIN?

13:54.634 --> 13:55.967
'CAUSE IN
PICTURE NUMBER THREE,

13:55.969 --> 13:57.936
THEY WERE LICKING
EACH OTHER'S GELATO.

13:59.773 --> 14:01.639
I MEAN, GUYS, SERIOUSLY,
WHAT DO I DO?

14:01.641 --> 14:03.041
BE HONEST WITH HIM.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.276
EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED
AND SEE WHAT HE SAYS.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.712
YEAH, AND REMEMBER,
PEOPLE CAN LOOK
GUILTY OF SOMETHING

14:07.714 --> 14:09.380
EVEN IF THEY'RE
COMPLETELY INNOCENT.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.949
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCREW THAT.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.451
MAKE A FAKE PROFILE,
"FRIEND" JACKIE,

14:13.453 --> 14:14.919
COMB THROUGH
THAT SKANK'S PAGE,

14:14.921 --> 14:15.954
AND NAIL HIS ASS
TO THE WALL.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.593
OR WE CAN DO
WHAT EMILY SAYS.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.242
HEY.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.377
HOW ARE YOU?
RELIEVED...

14:39.379 --> 14:41.613
THAT YOU'RE
SPEAKING TO ME.

14:41.615 --> 14:43.915
I WASN'T SURE
IF YOU'D HEARD
THE COPS' THEORY

14:43.917 --> 14:45.516
ABOUT ME PLANTING EVIDENCE.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.518
WE SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT THIS.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.520
SO YOU DO THINK IT WAS ME?

14:51.358 --> 14:52.490
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.660
BUT I CAN'T SAY
THE SAME FOR MY FAMILY.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.932
SPENCER,
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

15:00.934 --> 15:04.335
THOSE GUYS HAVE A WAY
OF ADDING TWO AND TWO

15:04.337 --> 15:05.370
AND COMING UP WITH FIVE.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.375
I'LL STOP BY
YOUR PLACE LATER.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.378
UM, I'M NOT SURE
THAT THAT'S SUCH
A GOOD IDEA.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.416
WHY NOT?

15:18.417 --> 15:20.617
BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS
DON'T WANT YOU NEAR ME?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.720
MAKES SENSE.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.455
HOW 'BOUT THE FESTIVAL?

15:24.457 --> 15:27.358
MAYBE WE COULD
MEET UP BEHIND A TENT,

15:27.360 --> 15:29.160
OR THE FUNHOUSE.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.561
SEVEN O'CLOCK?

15:30.563 --> 15:33.665
TOBY. I NEED YOU
TO DRIVE ME TO SCHOOL.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.066
I HAVE A MAKE-UP TEST.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.035
OKAY, JUST...
LET ME GET CLEANED UP.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.822
HEY, SPENCER.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.461
UH... HOW'S IT GOIN'?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.463
YOU TELL ME, GARRETT.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.731
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ON OUR SIDE.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.866
I DON'T GET TO HAVE
PERSONAL FEELINGS

16:08.868 --> 16:10.468
WHEN I'M IN UNIFORM.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.736
WELL, IF YOU PUT ON
A PAIR OF JEANS,

16:11.738 --> 16:12.971
THIS WOULD
BE CALLED STALKING.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.407
SPENCER, LOOK.

16:16.409 --> 16:19.143
IF BEING TRAILED
IS GONNA HELP
CLEAR YOUR NAME,

16:19.145 --> 16:21.012
BETTER IT'S ME
THAN SOMEONE WHO
THINKS YOU'RE GUILTY.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.455
Female Vocalist:
<i> ¶ FIRE INSIDE ¶</i>

16:30.457 --> 16:32.590

<i> OUT IN FRONT OF ME ¶</i>

HEY, ARE YOU PAIGE?

16:49.175 --> 16:54.712
WHAT? OH, NO.
I'M EMILY, HER FRIEND.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.147
ARE YOU...?

16:56.149 --> 16:57.015
SAMARA.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.850
I GO TO SHERIDAN PREP.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.818
MEMBER OF THE CAMPUS
PRIDE GROUP.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.153
DID YOUR FRIEND TELL YOU?

17:02.155 --> 17:03.855
YEAH. SORRY.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.790
DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU'D BE SO...

17:08.228 --> 17:10.795
PUNCTUAL.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.564
OKAY, SO EVEN THOUGH
WE CAN'T SEE HER PROFILE,

17:13.566 --> 17:15.066
JACKIE AND MR. FITZ--

17:15.068 --> 17:16.401
EZRA.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.302
WENT TO THE SAME COLLEGE.

17:18.304 --> 17:21.906
SO I LOOKED UP ALUMNI
AND PUNCHED IN RANDOM NAMES

17:21.908 --> 17:25.877
UNTIL I FOUND A GIRL
WHO ALREADY DIDN'T HAVE A PAGE.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.779
TONYA FREEMAN?
YEP.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.147
WHO'S THAT?
WHO CARES?

17:29.149 --> 17:31.449
THIS IS STARTING
TO FEEL SO WRONG.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.017
HEY, IT'S SO NOT.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.720
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

17:35.722 --> 17:39.057
FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU,
AND FOOL MY BEST FRIEND,
YOU'RE DEAD-FRICKIN'-MEAT.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.025
HM, THAT'S... TENDER.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.494
BUT WHAT ABOUT
A PROFILE PICTURE?

17:43.496 --> 17:45.196
OH, WE'RE NOT
PUTTING ONE UP.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.498
OKAY, IF THE PROFILE
IS FACELESS,

17:47.500 --> 17:50.001
JACKIE WILL ASSUME IT WAS
SOMEONE SHE USED TO BE
FRIENDS WITH,

17:50.003 --> 17:52.036
FEEL GUILTY
SHE FORGOT THEY EXIST,

17:52.038 --> 17:54.806
AND ACCEPT
THE FRIEND REQUEST.

17:54.808 --> 17:57.575
WELL, JACKIE IS ABOUT
TO BE REUNITED

17:57.577 --> 17:59.844
WITH ONE OF HER OLD PALS.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.879
YOU DO THE HONORS,
TONYA.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.883
ARIA, DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW THE TRUTH OR NOT?

18:12.358 --> 18:13.658
Female Vocalist:
<i> ¶ UPSIDE ¶</i>

18:18.398 --> 18:22.633
EMILY, NOT TO BE RUDE,
BUT... IS THERE A FRIEND?

18:22.635 --> 18:24.068
WHAT?

18:24.070 --> 18:25.803
LOOK, IF YOU
MADE IT THIS FAR,
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.839
OH, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT ME.

18:27.841 --> 18:29.707
THIS IS ABOUT PAIGE,

18:29.709 --> 18:32.743
SOMEONE I'M STARTING TO DATE.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.212
THAT'S WHY THIS SUCKS.

18:34.214 --> 18:37.248
FEELS LIKE IT'S
A STEP BACK FOR ME.
I GET IT.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.951
I WAS WITH A CLOSETED GIRL
WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.986
NOTHING BUT DRAMA.

18:41.988 --> 18:45.356
I START TO REALIZE
THAT IF IT WAS MEANT TO BE,
IT SHOULDN'T BE THIS HARD.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.057
( soft chuckle )

18:49.195 --> 18:50.995
SOMETHING TELLS ME
SHE'S NOT COMING.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.498
( sighs )
I'M SORRY.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.766
IT'S OKAY. I HAD TO BE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
ANYWAY.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.668
I'M SETTING UP A BOOTH
AT THE FESTIVAL.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.771
ME AND SOME FRIENDS
FROM ART CLASS ARE
SELLING HANDMADE JEWELRY.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.241
THAT'S CUTE.
DID YOU MAKE THAT?

19:03.243 --> 19:04.675
YEAH. THANKS.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.578
HEY, IF YOU WANT TO SEE MORE,
YOU SHOULD COME BY EARLY,

19:07.580 --> 19:09.413
GET THE FIRST CHOICE.

19:09.415 --> 19:10.548
ARE YOU FREE
TOMORROW MORNING?

19:16.523 --> 19:18.156
( laughing )
AW, CUTE.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.957
DID YOU COME UP
WITH THAT YOURSELF,
MRS. ACKARD?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.659
WELL, IF YOU WANT PEOPLE
TO COUGH UP MONEY,

19:21.661 --> 19:23.794
YOU'D BETTER MAKE 'EM SMILE.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.630
Ian: OKAY, WE'RE GOOD.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.265
THAT TENT'S NOT
COMING DOWN ANYTIME SOON.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.368
OH, WE FEEL SAFE
IN YOUR HANDS, IAN.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.504
SHAME ON YOU TWO FOR NOT
HAVING A CHURCH WEDDING
IN ROSEWOOD.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.973
WELL, WE PLAN ON
MAKING UP FOR IT.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.843
OUR BABY'S GONNA HAVE
THE BIGGEST CHRISTENING
THIS TOWN'S EVER SEEN.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.144
OH, GOOD!

19:40.146 --> 19:42.413
WE NEED AS MANY
JOYOUS EVENTS AS POSSIBLE.

19:42.415 --> 19:45.082
THIS TOWN STILL HASN'T
RECOVERED SINCE ALISON'S...

19:47.754 --> 19:50.354
OH. ME AND MY LOOSE LIPS.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.822
I'M SORRY.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.425
NO, IT'S OKAY, MRS. ACKARD.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.227
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

19:56.229 --> 19:58.729
SPENCER'S DOING REALLY WELL.

19:58.731 --> 20:03.000
IAN, BEFORE I FORGET,
THE REVEREND AND I ARE
PLANNING A GOLF TRIP,

20:03.002 --> 20:04.902
BUT WE CAN'T DECIDE
BETWEEN PEBBLE BEACH,

20:04.904 --> 20:07.271
KAANAPALI, HILTON HEAD...

20:07.273 --> 20:08.239
OOH!

20:08.241 --> 20:10.641
IAN KNOWS ALL ABOUT
HILTON HEAD.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.376
OH, HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?

20:12.378 --> 20:13.878
YEAH.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.480
UM... I ONLY
PLAYED THERE ONCE,
BUT IT WAS A DREAM.

20:16.482 --> 20:18.349
Mrs. Ackard: AND DID YOU
STAY THERE TOO?

20:18.351 --> 20:19.784
YEAH, UM...
AND MAKE SURE YOU GET

20:19.786 --> 20:22.220
A ROOM OVERLOOKING
THE NINTH HOLE, RIGHT, HON?

20:22.222 --> 20:25.690
DEFINITELY.
THE ROOM'S GOT
AN AMAZING OCEAN VIEW.

20:25.692 --> 20:26.991
OH, REALLY?

20:26.993 --> 20:29.060
THE BROCHURE SAYS THAT
THE GOLF COURSE AND THE OCEAN

20:29.062 --> 20:31.028
ARE ON OPPOSITE
SIDES OF THE HOTEL.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.631
OH, NO, THAT'S RIGHT.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.601
UM, I WAS THINKING ABOUT
THE VIEW FROM THE HOTEL
RESTAURANT.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.702
OHH!

20:42.809 --> 20:44.308
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

20:47.714 --> 20:51.682
OH, IAN, COULD YOU
HELP ME WITH THIS BOX
OUT TO THE BOOTH, PLEASE?

20:51.684 --> 20:53.217
AH, YES, MA'AM.
OF COURSE.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.395
SO, DID YOU TELL
THE POLICE THAT YOU STAYED

21:04.397 --> 21:07.732
ON OPPOSITE SIDES
OF THE HOTEL,

21:07.734 --> 21:09.133
OR WERE YOU
EVEN AT HILTON HEAD?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.985
Female Vocalist:
<i> ¶ NOTHIN' TURNS OUT ¶</i>

21:27.987 --> 21:29.420
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.122
<i> ¶ THE WAY YOU WANTED ¶</i>

21:31.124 --> 21:33.224
DID YOU MAKE THESE?

21:33.226 --> 21:35.092
NOT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN,
BUT... TOOT-TOOT!

21:39.966 --> 21:44.669
WOW. THEY LOOK...
AMAZING WITH YOUR SKIN TONE.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.237
YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM.

21:46.239 --> 21:49.106
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GIVE THEM TO ME.

21:49.108 --> 21:53.444
OKAY, STEAL THEM.
I'LL TURN AROUND.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.211
EMILY?

21:56.416 --> 21:57.615
HI.

21:57.617 --> 21:58.816
HI.

21:58.818 --> 22:02.520
UH, PAIGE, THIS IS
SAMARA FROM SHERIDAN PREP,

22:02.522 --> 22:05.623
WHO YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO MEET AT THE GRILLE.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.425
OH. HI.

22:07.427 --> 22:08.993
HI.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.429
LOOK, IF YOU EVER
WANT TO RESCHEDULE,

22:11.431 --> 22:14.598
GRAB A COFFEE,
TALK ABOUT YOUR DAD,
EMILY HAS MY CELL.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.238
UM...

22:21.240 --> 22:23.474
TELL YOUR FRIEND
HOW HOT SHE LOOKS
IN THOSE EARRINGS.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.248
( soft knocking )

22:34.620 --> 22:36.654
OH, HEY, MRS. MARIN.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.055
HANNA'S NOT HERE.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.658
SHE'S, UM...

22:40.660 --> 22:41.859
SETTING UP FOR THE FESTIVAL.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.133
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

22:49.135 --> 22:51.035
SCREWDRIVER.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.570
I ACCIDENTALLY PACKED IT.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.839
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK
I MADE OFF WITH YOUR STUFF.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.774
SO WHERE ARE YOU STAYING?

22:56.776 --> 22:59.110
WELL, FOR THE NEXT
FEW NIGHTS, ON A BUS,

22:59.112 --> 23:01.379
ON MY WAY TO ARIZONA.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.813
DOES HANNA
KNOW YOU'RE LEAVING?

23:02.815 --> 23:04.482
I DON'T EXPECT HER OR YOU

23:04.484 --> 23:06.650
TO THROW ME
A GOING-AWAY PARTY.

23:06.652 --> 23:08.719
ALL I KNOW IS MY DAUGHTER'S
SITTING IN A DARK ROOM

23:08.721 --> 23:11.389
LISTENING TO
ELLIOTT SMITH ON A LOOP.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.190
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

23:13.192 --> 23:16.127
WOULD IT MATTER?
YOU WERE NEVER REALLY
MY BIGGEST FAN.

23:16.129 --> 23:18.095
THAT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT TO SEE MY DAUGHTER

23:18.097 --> 23:19.930
LISTENING TO
ELLIOTT SMITH ON A LOOP.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.833
I'M NOT JUDGING.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.001
I THINK SHE'S LUCKY.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.371
MAYBE IF I HAD
A MOM LIKE YOU,

23:27.373 --> 23:28.806
I WOULDN'T BE
SLEEPING ON A BUS

23:28.808 --> 23:30.741
AND MAKING UP THE RULES
AS I GO ALONG.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.186
CAN YOU GIVE THIS TO HER?

23:44.724 --> 23:47.057
YOU SHOULD GO TO THE FESTIVAL
AND GIVE IT TO HER YOURSELF.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.429
HANNA DOESN'T NEED
ONE MORE GUY IN HER LIFE

23:51.431 --> 23:52.696
LEAVING WITHOUT
SAYING GOODBYE.

23:59.405 --> 24:01.238
WHAT DID YOU TELL HER...

24:01.240 --> 24:02.573
ABOUT ME?

24:02.575 --> 24:03.574
NOTHING.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.409
I TOLD HER YOU WERE
DEALING WITH STUFF,

24:05.411 --> 24:07.077
YOU WERE SCARED
YOUR PARENTS WOULD...

24:07.079 --> 24:08.412
I WISH
YOU HADN'T DONE THAT.

24:08.414 --> 24:09.980
IF I DIDN'T SHOW UP,
THERE WAS A REASON.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.749
HEY.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.818
THE SECOND YOU GUYS LEFT,
EVERYBODY SUDDENLY
GOT THIRSTY.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.253
( soft chuckle )

24:16.255 --> 24:17.688
UH, HERE,
FOR THE EARRINGS.

24:22.061 --> 24:25.062
LOOK, PAIGE, I HOPE
IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
I WAS CALLING YOU OUT.

24:25.064 --> 24:27.465
I GET IT.
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

24:27.467 --> 24:30.067
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO BE NICE AND EVERYTHING,

24:30.069 --> 24:32.336
BUT, HONESTLY,
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

24:32.338 --> 24:33.838
PAIGE!
WHAT?

24:33.840 --> 24:35.873
SORRY, EMILY, I'M NOT
LOOKING TO JOIN A CLUB

24:35.875 --> 24:38.309
AND RIDE DOWN MAIN STREET
ON A RAINBOW CHOPPER.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.110
ACTUALLY,
I DRIVE A JEEP.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.812
BUT THAT'S
BESIDE THE POINT.

24:41.814 --> 24:45.282
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS TO GO.

24:45.284 --> 24:46.784
I'VE GOT A PAPER
THAT'S DUE.

24:46.786 --> 24:50.120
TELL YOUR FRIENDS
IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO MEET THEM.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.590
EMILY, WAIT.
WHAT?

24:52.592 --> 24:54.725
SO YOU CAN BE
RUDE TO ME TOO?

24:54.727 --> 24:57.495
YOU KNOW WHAT, PAIGE?
THIS IS BECOMING
WAY TOO MUCH DRAMA.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.363
I DON'T WANT
TO BE YOUR SECRET.

25:04.103 --> 25:07.037
( clattering sound )

25:07.039 --> 25:09.206
Female Vocalist:
<i> ¶ MAYBE ALL THIS TIME ¶</i>

25:09.208 --> 25:10.741
<i> ¶ WE'VE BEEN HELD DOWN ¶</i>

25:12.645 --> 25:13.944
<i> ( incoming message chime )</i>

25:15.815 --> 25:18.949
<i> ¶ BY THE HEAVY WEIGHT</i>
<i> OF OUR OWN THOUGHTS ¶</i>

25:24.490 --> 25:27.658
<i> ¶ MAYBE ALL THIS TIME</i>
<i> WE'VE SEARCHED AROUND ¶</i>

25:31.631 --> 25:33.564
<i> ¶ IT'S BEEN SO LONG ¶</i>

25:33.566 --> 25:36.901
<i> ¶ IT'S BEEN SO LONG</i>
<i> THAT WE'VE FORGOT ¶</i>

25:40.506 --> 25:44.542
<i> ¶ WHAT WE WANT ¶</i>

25:44.544 --> 25:49.346
<i> ¶ WHAT WE WANT ¶</i>

25:49.348 --> 25:53.217
<i> ¶ WHAT WE WANT ¶</i>

25:53.219 --> 25:55.653
MONA. THOUGHT YOU
WERE GONNA HELP.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.421
I AM HELPING.
I'M MAKING SURE YOU DON'T

25:57.423 --> 25:59.623
HOST A PITY PARTY
FOR YOURSELF AND INVITE
A CHEESECAKE.

26:05.164 --> 26:08.866
UM, DON'T LOOK NOW,
BUT SKETCHY IS AT 12:00.

26:08.868 --> 26:11.368
( sighs )
I-I CANNOT DEAL
WITH HIM RIGHT NOW.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.837
JUST DON'T
TELL HIM I'M HERE.

26:13.839 --> 26:17.775
<i> ¶ WHO YOU ARE</i>
<i> AND WHO YOU'RE NOT ¶</i>

26:17.777 --> 26:19.743
WE'RE NOT OPEN
FOR BUSINESS YET.

26:19.745 --> 26:21.779
I KNOW. HANNA'S MOM
SAID THAT--

26:21.781 --> 26:22.980
SHE HAD TO STEP OUT.

26:24.483 --> 26:25.983
ANY IDEA WHEN
SHE'LL BE BACK?

26:25.985 --> 26:27.217
PROBABLY WHEN YOU LEAVE.

26:29.322 --> 26:30.888
YOU REALLY HURT HER, CALEB.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.424
<i> ¶ IT'S BEEN SO LONG</i>
<i> THAT YOU FORGOT ¶</i>

26:37.096 --> 26:38.329
MAKE SURE SHE GETS THIS.

26:38.331 --> 26:41.932
<i> ¶ WHAT YOU WANT ¶</i>

26:41.934 --> 26:46.136
<i> ¶ WHAT YOU WANT ¶</i>

26:46.138 --> 26:50.140

26:50.142 --> 26:54.612

26:54.614 --> 26:58.749
<i> ¶ WHAT WE WANT ¶</i>

26:58.751 --> 27:03.787
<i> ¶ WHAT WE WANT ¶</i>

27:03.789 --> 27:07.558
<i> ¶ WHAT WE WANT</i>
<i> WE HAVE ALREADY GOT ¶</i>

27:12.031 --> 27:17.034
<i> ¶ WHAT WE WANT</i>
<i> WE HAVE ALREADY ¶</i>

27:17.036 --> 27:18.135
<i> ¶ GOT ¶</i>

27:18.137 --> 27:19.303
WHAT DID HE WANT?

27:19.305 --> 27:20.771
CHANGE FOR A TWENTY.

27:20.773 --> 27:22.606
<i> ¶ WHAT WE WANT WE HAVE... ¶</i>

27:22.608 --> 27:24.675
CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH THE TAPE?

27:24.677 --> 27:26.377
<i> ¶ ALREADY GOT ¶</i>

27:37.023 --> 27:38.756
<i> ( up-tempo music playing )</i>

27:38.758 --> 27:40.691
( indistinct happy chatter )

27:47.700 --> 27:50.467
Woman: ( happily )
OH, MY GOD!

27:50.469 --> 27:52.302
( happy chatter continuing )

27:55.274 --> 27:58.175
HEY. WE'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

27:58.177 --> 28:01.812
WHY? DID THE REVEREND'S WIFE
START TO SEE THROUGH
YOUR ACT TOO?

28:01.814 --> 28:03.714
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA LEARN
TO JUST KEEP QUIET?

28:03.716 --> 28:05.015
GET AWAY FROM ME.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.017
YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME
YOU TRY TO BRING ME DOWN,

28:07.019 --> 28:08.218
YOU END UP IN TROUBLE.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.921
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT QUICKSAND, SPENCE.

28:10.923 --> 28:13.490
THE MORE YOU STRUGGLE,
THE FASTER YOU SINK.

28:13.492 --> 28:14.958
AND YOU'RE SINKING FAST.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.633
SO...

28:22.635 --> 28:25.536
<i> RUNAWAY BRIDE,</i>
<i> TOP-SECRET AFFAIR,</i>

28:25.538 --> 28:28.238
ALL FIVE SEASONS
OF<i> BIG LOVE.</i>

28:28.240 --> 28:30.040
I SENSE A THEME HERE.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.276
YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME SOMETHING?

28:32.278 --> 28:33.243
YEAH.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.380
I GUESS I AM.

28:38.184 --> 28:39.683
BUT AFTER I DO,

28:39.685 --> 28:40.951
YOU HAVE TO
TELL ME SOMETHING.

28:42.688 --> 28:43.520
OKAY.

28:45.357 --> 28:46.890
FRIDAY...

28:46.892 --> 28:51.528
WHEN-- WHEN I GOT HERE
BEFORE YOU, I...

28:51.530 --> 28:54.264
I SAW A PHOTO
ON YOUR WEBSITE PAGE

28:54.266 --> 28:57.234
OF YOU... AND JACKIE.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.536
I WASN'T
LOOKING FOR IT, OKAY?

28:59.538 --> 29:01.538
I WAS HUNTING DOWN YOUR MENUS
AND THE PHOTO POPPED UP,

29:01.540 --> 29:03.741
AND... I COULDN'T
HELP BUT NOTICE

29:03.743 --> 29:06.210
HOW HAPPY
THE TWO OF YOU WERE.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.578
AND, OH, DID I
MENTION A RING?

29:07.580 --> 29:10.147
BECAUSE SHE WAS
WEARING A RING.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.683
LOOK, EZRA,
I AM NOT COMING

29:12.685 --> 29:15.252
FROM SOME FREAKY,
JEALOUS PLACE, OKAY?

29:15.254 --> 29:17.955
I MEAN, MAYBE I WAS
WHEN I PICKED OUT<i> BIG LOVE,</i>

29:17.957 --> 29:19.990
BUT, HONESTLY...

29:19.992 --> 29:22.426
I-I JUST FEEL LIKE
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT ME,

29:22.428 --> 29:26.563
AND I DON'T
FEEL LIKE YOU'VE
SHARED AS MUCH.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.132
PLEASE JUMP IN
AT ANY TIME.

29:33.038 --> 29:35.172
I... UH...

29:35.174 --> 29:41.011
I MET JACKIE
MY FRESHMAN YEAR
IN THE DORM.

29:41.013 --> 29:45.015
WE SAW EACH OTHER
ON AND OFF FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS.

29:45.017 --> 29:45.749
GOOD.

29:48.187 --> 29:49.153
I NEED MORE.

29:51.423 --> 29:55.292
SHE WAS THE FIRST REALLY
SERIOUS GIRLFRIEND
I EVER HAD.

29:55.294 --> 29:58.595
I DATED OTHER PEOPLE,
BUT NONE OF THEM WERE HER.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.430
SO, WHEN WE GOT
BACK TOGETHER, I...

30:00.432 --> 30:02.766
( chuckles )
I PROPOSED.

30:02.768 --> 30:05.502
THAT PICTURE WAS
TAKEN IN FLORENCE.

30:05.504 --> 30:08.071
I BOUGHT THE RING
ON THE PONTE VECCHIO.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.474
MY BROTHER HAD TO
WIRE ME THE MONEY.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.943
I DIDN'T EVEN TELL HIM
WHAT IT WAS FOR.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.311
WHY?

30:14.313 --> 30:16.780
'CAUSE I WASN'T SURE
WHAT HER ANSWER WOULD BE.

30:16.782 --> 30:20.818
SO... YOU WERE MARRIED?

30:20.820 --> 30:23.220
NO. NO,
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.121
OH.

30:27.259 --> 30:28.358
WHY DID YOU BREAK IT OFF?

30:31.030 --> 30:33.197
I DIDN'T. SHE DID.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.097
OH.

30:38.704 --> 30:41.338
FITZ, WHY HASN'T SHE
TAKEN DOWN THAT PHOTO?

30:41.340 --> 30:43.240
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.975
GUESS IT WAS A GREAT SUMMER

30:44.977 --> 30:46.844
WITH LOTS OF MEMORIES
SHE WANTS TO HOLD ON TO.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.948
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

30:50.950 --> 30:52.516
ARIA, THAT'S HER PHOTO,
NOT MINE.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.518
BUT IF SHE HADN'T
GIVEN YOU BACK THAT RING,

30:54.520 --> 30:56.053
YOU'D BE MARRIED
TO HER RIGHT NOW.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.023
POSSIBLY.

31:00.025 --> 31:03.460
AND YOU'VE NEVER
TOLD ME THIS BECAUSE...

31:03.462 --> 31:05.229
I GUESS
I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

31:05.231 --> 31:07.798
THAT DOESN'T PUT THINGS
THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT
ON MY RéSUMé.

31:11.470 --> 31:12.569
WHAT'S...

31:14.807 --> 31:16.974
WHAT'S
BOTHERING YOU MORE--

31:16.976 --> 31:18.976
THAT OLD PHOTO
BEING OUT THERE,

31:18.978 --> 31:23.881
OR... THE FACT THAT
YOU AND I CAN'T TAKE
A PICTURE LIKE THAT?

31:23.883 --> 31:25.182
HM?

31:29.588 --> 31:30.888
ARIA.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.560
THAT WAS THEN.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.729
YOU'RE VERY MUCH NOW.

31:49.775 --> 31:51.642
( indistinct happy chatter )

31:55.581 --> 31:57.414
HEY, SWEETIE,
HOW'S IT GOING?

31:57.416 --> 31:58.882
GOOD.

31:58.884 --> 32:00.817
DID CALEB COME BY?

32:00.819 --> 32:03.086
NOPE. HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

32:03.088 --> 32:03.820
OH.

32:05.791 --> 32:09.793
HE CAME BY THE HOUSE.
I THINK HE WANTED
TO SAY GOODBYE.

32:09.795 --> 32:11.194
HE'S LEAVING ROSEWOOD.

32:13.866 --> 32:15.232
HE IS?

32:15.234 --> 32:16.199
YEAH.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.637
WELL... GOOD RIDDANCE.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.706
LOOK, YOU CALLED IT, MOM.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.741
SOME BAD BOYS
ARE JUST THAT. BAD.

32:24.743 --> 32:27.010
THE THING IS, I WAS WRONG.

32:27.012 --> 32:28.645
BUT IF IT
MAKES A DIFFERENCE,

32:28.647 --> 32:31.815
MY FIRST IMPRESSION
OF HIM WAS WAY OFF.

32:31.817 --> 32:33.483
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING NOW
THAT YOU DIDN'T SEE BEFORE?

32:37.756 --> 32:39.122
MYSELF.

32:49.034 --> 32:50.233
<i> ( incoming message chime )</i>

32:58.644 --> 32:59.810
<i> ( incoming message chime )</i>

33:09.855 --> 33:12.222
I BROUGHT YOU A PRESENT
BACK FROM MY TRIP,

33:12.224 --> 33:14.992
BUT YOU HAVE
TO KEEP IT A SECRET.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.994
I DIDN'T BRING ANYTHING
BACK FOR THE OTHER GIRLS,

33:16.996 --> 33:19.663
SO IF THEY ASK ABOUT IT,
YOU HAVE TO LIE.

33:19.665 --> 33:20.564
PROMISE?

33:27.473 --> 33:29.506
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.675
IT'S VINTAGE.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.510
MY GRANDMA GAVE IT TO ME.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.745
I WANTED YOU TO HAVE IT.

33:37.416 --> 33:42.386
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT
REALLY UNDERSTANDS ME, EM,

33:42.388 --> 33:44.788
THE ONLY ONE THAT I CAN
COMPLETELY BE HONEST WITH.

33:50.396 --> 33:51.862
I HAVE TO GO.

33:51.864 --> 33:53.764
I HAVE A PRIOR ENGAGEMENT.

33:53.766 --> 33:56.199
WE'LL DEFINITELY
SEE YOU LATER, RIGHT?

33:56.201 --> 33:56.967
YEAH.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.804
DON'T HAVE ANY FUN
WITHOUT ME.

34:00.806 --> 34:02.339
( soft chuckle )

34:09.348 --> 34:12.215
MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THAT
IN A SAFE PLACE.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.550
IT'S A LOT MORE VALUABLE
THAN IT LOOKS.

34:30.836 --> 34:31.935
( sighs )

35:00.165 --> 35:02.232
Woman on Television:
<i> ...COCKTAIL PARTIES</i>
<i> I GAVE?</i>

35:02.234 --> 35:05.001

WHAT HAPPENED?

35:07.873 --> 35:09.573
HERE, PUT THAT
OVER YOUR HEAD.

35:09.575 --> 35:12.442
ARE YOU GONNA TORTURE ME
'CAUSE I GAVE SOMEBODY
ELSE A RING?

35:12.444 --> 35:14.177
ARIA, SERIOUSLY,
IT WASN'T EVEN A KARAT.

35:14.179 --> 35:16.046
GET IN THE BAG, MR. FITZ.

35:16.048 --> 35:17.514
WE'RE TAKING A PICTURE
AS A COUPLE.

35:25.757 --> 35:28.158
YOU KNOW THIS IS NUTS,

I HAVE TO LEAVE.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.484
N-NOW?

35:54.486 --> 35:56.419
ARE YOU COMING BACK?

35:56.421 --> 35:58.021
UM...

35:58.023 --> 36:00.557
I-I DON'T KNOW. I MIGHT.
I'LL CALL YOU. LOVE YOU.

36:00.559 --> 36:01.424
YOU TOO.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.131
HEY, EM, IT'S ME.
I'M ON MY WAY.

Boy: HOW DO YOU
GET OUT OF HERE?

36:51.243 --> 36:52.776
WHICH WAY SHOULD WE GO?

36:52.778 --> 36:55.345
IS IT UP HERE?

36:55.347 --> 36:57.080
( playfully sinister

HANNA!

38:03.215 --> 38:05.148
WHY DIDN'T YOU
ANSWER YOUR PHONE?

38:05.150 --> 38:07.717
I LEFT IT AT THE BOOTH.
YOU DIDN'T GET EMILY'S TEXT?

38:07.719 --> 38:10.453
SHE FOUND THE KEY,
THE KEY THAT JENNA
WAS LOOKING FOR.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.155
SHE WANTS US TO MEET HER
AT THAT STORAGE PLACE
NEAR HOLLIS.

38:12.157 --> 38:16.192
WHERE'S SPENCER?
I COULDN'T REACH HER.
HOPEFULLY, SHE'S ON THE WAY.

38:16.194 --> 38:18.128
SOMEBODY PLEASE OPEN THIS!

38:18.130 --> 38:20.730

39:07.846 --> 39:09.045
EXCUSE THE MESS.

39:15.187 --> 39:17.620
WHAT IS THIS REGARDING?

39:17.622 --> 39:19.522

39:39.811 --> 39:40.977
I HAVE NO IDEA.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.916
Aria:

ARIZONA. WHO CARES?

39:53.725 --> 39:56.025
HANNA. HEY.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.727

39:57.729 --> 39:59.796

approach )

40:37.402 --> 40:39.936
OH, HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

40:39.938 --> 40:42.572
Melissa: YOU NEEDED
A CROWBAR TO GET HER OUT?

40:42.574 --> 40:44.340
Ian: IT'S WHAT
WAS KEEPING HER IN.

40:44.342 --> 40:46.576
SOMEBODY JAMMED
THE DOOR WITH IT.

40:46.578 --> 40:47.811
<i> ( incoming message chime )</i>

40:57.989 --> 40:59.989
NOBODY ELSE COMES IN HERE
UNTIL YOU FIGURE THIS OUT.

40:59.991 --> 41:01.825
MY SISTER-IN-LAW
COULD HAVE BEEN
SERIOUSLY HURT.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.274

42:12.947 --> 42:14.063
THAT'S ALI'S OLD LUNCHBOX
FROM WHEN SHE WAS A KID.

42:18.837 --> 42:20.303
WHAT IS THAT?

42:20.305 --> 42:21.738

HANNA, WAIT.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.274
WAIT FOR WHAT?

42:24.276 --> 42:25.275
FOR SOMEONE ELSE
TO TAKE IT?

42:32.250 --> 42:34.317
<i> ( girls laughing )</i>

42:34.319 --> 42:36.953
SOMEONE'S BEEN SPYING
ON US FOR YEARS.

42:36.955 --> 42:39.422
AND ALI DIDN'T TAKE
THE VIDEO. SHE'S IN IT.

42:39.424 --> 42:41.024
SHE'S IN A LOT OF 'EM.

42:41.026 --> 42:44.694
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S JULY 4th.

42:44.696 --> 42:47.297
SHE ALWAYS SAID IT WAS
TOBY PEEPING ON US.

42:47.299 --> 42:49.899
NO, THERE'S NO WAY
THAT THIS IS TOBY.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.868
WELL, THEN, WHO IS IT?

42:51.870 --> 42:54.270
HOW 'BOUT WHY?

42:54.272 --> 42:56.239
WHY DID ALISON
HAVE THESE VIDEOS?

42:56.241 --> 42:58.975
DID THE PERSON
WHO TOOK THIS
KNOW SHE HAD THEM?

42:58.977 --> 43:00.310
IS THIS WHY SHE WAS KILLED?
