01:02.650 --> 01:05.418
Ah!

01:08.825 --> 01:13.416
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

01:54.798 --> 01:56.998
What do you have
in your hand?

01:57.066 --> 01:59.435
- Nothing.
- Nothing, you say?

02:07.220 --> 02:11.186
- Give Father La Stessa back his coin.
- Oh, no!

02:12.028 --> 02:17.275
I've, uh... found you a cottage,
more space.

02:17.298 --> 02:20.655
The boy,
he's growing up so fast.

02:21.401 --> 02:26.914
Lara, the roof is falling in.
More winds will come. It's not safe.

02:26.938 --> 02:31.834
Please, Father.
You do too much for us already.

02:32.222 --> 02:34.429
Come on, Tiar.

02:50.853 --> 02:55.996
I'm getting hints of roasted lamb
and a honey-based ale.

02:56.020 --> 02:57.558
We're definitely in Malta.

02:57.579 --> 03:01.348
Yeah. You don't have to do
that whole sniffy routine.

03:01.372 --> 03:03.984
You could just ask someone.

03:05.847 --> 03:12.225
We should register with the harbour master,
but it appears he's abandoned his post.

03:12.248 --> 03:16.573
Finally! Where have you been?
Making a blanket for our journey?

03:18.351 --> 03:21.263
I'm not coming with you.

03:21.286 --> 03:22.316
What?

03:22.340 --> 03:25.487
Oh, come on.
A map to the Land of the Dead

03:25.508 --> 03:28.702
- drawn by some crazy old man?
- Angelico's not crazy.

03:28.725 --> 03:31.414
Gunnar, I need this map.
You know I do.

03:31.432 --> 03:33.675
Not this time, my friend.

03:33.687 --> 03:36.998
I have silks to deliver
and monies to collect.

03:37.021 --> 03:39.595
It's a mythic land.
There's no proof it actually exists.

03:39.616 --> 03:44.193
But if it does, it is the last place I should go
and the last place I would be welcome.

03:44.217 --> 03:46.082
Yes, but I have to go.

03:46.105 --> 03:50.772
It's the Land of the Dead, Sinbad.
The living don't go.

03:55.951 --> 03:59.297
No wonder they seek
the company of witches.

04:00.883 --> 04:05.474
Fine, go.
Enjoy yourself.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.823
Go and help Brother Angelico.

04:24.846 --> 04:27.614
Be gentle with him.

04:53.325 --> 04:55.892
Did I not promise you
honeyed ale?

04:55.960 --> 05:00.050
It's not exactly tracking when there's
a great tavern sign above the door.

05:01.013 --> 05:04.767
If Gunnar won't look for this map,
then what does that say?

05:04.835 --> 05:08.371
Sinbad needs us more than ever.

05:29.448 --> 05:31.534
Can I help you?

05:31.558 --> 05:34.534
This is the house of the tailor?

05:34.558 --> 05:37.157
My husband.

05:37.180 --> 05:41.501
Well, the silk merchant of Serif,

05:41.525 --> 05:43.453
when he heard we were
heading in this direction,

05:43.465 --> 05:46.575
he asked us to make a delivery.

05:46.599 --> 05:49.766
He said the tailor
would be expecting me.

05:49.834 --> 05:53.050
If I'd known you were coming,
I would have cancelled the order.

05:54.294 --> 05:55.891
My husband is dead.

05:55.915 --> 05:58.012
I cannot afford to
pay for your silk.

05:58.036 --> 06:00.443
I'm sorry your journey
has been wasted.

06:00.510 --> 06:05.697
Please. Take it with the
merchant's compliments.

06:05.721 --> 06:09.396
His mark-ups are
nothing short of theft.

06:11.968 --> 06:14.257
Well, have you eaten?

06:19.362 --> 06:22.731
Out!

06:24.819 --> 06:28.316
- He's not here. We should go.
- He'll be here.

06:28.335 --> 06:31.423
Is it usual for a monk to
reside in a tavern?

06:31.447 --> 06:33.755
Shouldn't we just go
direct to the monastery?

06:33.771 --> 06:36.610
- This map's not monastery business.
- Um...

06:36.629 --> 06:39.747
Philippe,
landlord of the Golden Star.

06:39.814 --> 06:43.527
Sinbad.
Four honeyed ales.

06:43.550 --> 06:45.452
Actually no,
make that five.

06:45.475 --> 06:48.293
If the good Lord permits
your friend to drink.

06:48.317 --> 06:51.605
The Tavern is for Islanders only.

06:51.628 --> 06:55.787
Actually, it's an Islander we're looking for.
Brother Angelico.

06:55.810 --> 06:57.863
Poor, dear man.

06:57.886 --> 07:01.878
Though his mind was beginning to wander
and he made little sense,

07:01.902 --> 07:03.335
I do miss his company.

07:03.336 --> 07:05.771
- What are you saying?
- Not dead.

07:05.772 --> 07:08.340
- Please no.
- Terribly close, I fear.

07:08.408 --> 07:11.176
But he's still at the monastery?

07:11.244 --> 07:15.746
Unless the Lord has intervened,
he's not left there in weeks.

07:20.077 --> 07:23.142
The brightest of minds,

07:23.165 --> 07:26.624
like a flame blown out.

07:26.691 --> 07:31.451
If he speaks at all,
it is in riddles.

07:31.474 --> 07:35.050
That you should come in our time of need,
we have the Lord to thank.

07:35.073 --> 07:42.072
If there's anything left, even a spark,
I will bring it out. It's my gift.

07:42.140 --> 07:48.277
Father, there's been another.
Hurt... it's the harbourmaster.

08:31.711 --> 08:33.953
Come here.

08:36.304 --> 08:39.352
I have someone who would
like to meet you.

08:40.844 --> 08:42.923
Say hello.

08:48.145 --> 08:51.096
Watch him very carefully.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.858
- You'll watch him?
- Mm-hmm.

08:56.286 --> 08:59.057
Now blow on him.

09:06.555 --> 09:11.628
What's he doing in there?
Think he wants to be with you.

09:17.485 --> 09:19.740
Very smart.

09:21.149 --> 09:23.680
Go show your mom.

09:39.044 --> 09:41.333
Tiger.

09:42.884 --> 09:45.033
We can still speak to him even
if he's weak.

09:45.101 --> 09:48.295
Angelico's dying. You think our last
conversation's going to be about your map?

09:48.318 --> 09:52.385
Do you think I don't
understand how you're feeling?

09:52.408 --> 09:54.943
I'm sorry about your friend,

09:55.010 --> 09:57.272
but is there someone else
who might know where it is,

09:57.284 --> 09:58.693
someone we can talk to?

09:58.713 --> 10:01.415
There's no one else.

10:03.608 --> 10:05.205
Great.

10:05.557 --> 10:09.563
Early closing.
And the only tavern is run by a neurotic.

10:09.586 --> 10:12.568
I don't think this is early closing.

10:43.693 --> 10:46.546
You have ash on your face.

10:47.263 --> 10:48.601
Hold on.

11:04.468 --> 11:10.712
Keep it, please, to remember this day
when you made my home again.

11:24.002 --> 11:27.020
I will remember today.

11:33.469 --> 11:37.205
What do you have in your hand, Tiar?

11:38.874 --> 11:43.848
Oh. Where did you get this?

11:45.539 --> 11:49.484
From the stranger with your mother?

12:00.914 --> 12:04.918
If we should pass this way again,

12:04.941 --> 12:09.968
if there is anything that you need,
anything that I can bring for you?

12:12.605 --> 12:17.821
The short wind is coming.
Stay until it's gone.

12:18.349 --> 12:20.826
That could be till nightfall.

12:20.850 --> 12:23.357
How would that look?

12:23.839 --> 12:26.809
I shouldn't have asked you
to come in.

12:26.833 --> 12:32.467
- I should've sent you away.
- Then tell me to go. Please.

12:37.592 --> 12:45.236
Zylok, it is only superstition.
It's just a wind.

12:45.303 --> 12:49.715
It wasn't a storm
that tore the house apart.

12:49.726 --> 12:54.176
It was the beast,
the Zylok fiend brought by the wind.

12:56.429 --> 13:00.280
Take my horses to the well, Tiar.

13:00.291 --> 13:03.732
Bring water if they have none.

13:03.756 --> 13:06.825
It came and tore my husband
from our bed

13:06.837 --> 13:10.101
and it will come again
because I've spoken of it.

13:10.126 --> 13:15.029
Oh, forgive me.
You'd be safe on your ship by now.

13:16.524 --> 13:19.636
I don't want to be safe.

13:28.546 --> 13:32.609
Find my friends.
Find Sinbad.

13:36.830 --> 13:39.399
This isn't right.
We should leave.

13:39.467 --> 13:43.554
No, I'm not leaving,
not without that map.

13:43.578 --> 13:46.605
So, you find the map to this terrible place.
And then what?

13:46.673 --> 13:48.507
Everything's right again?

13:48.575 --> 13:51.512
Get inside, hurry! Hurry!

13:55.915 --> 14:00.884
Oh my heavens, it's happened again, again.
Boots off, please.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.617
- What's going on out there?
- What exactly did you see?

14:03.641 --> 14:07.292
Don't play games with me.
That was the symbol of a Passover.

14:10.021 --> 14:13.804
Mess, have it cleaned up as
soon as possible.

14:14.708 --> 14:18.811
What is passing over?
What?

14:18.834 --> 14:24.531
The Zylok fiend. Terrible, terrible, a beast,
a monster, a killer, all these things.

14:24.555 --> 14:26.688
What is it?
What is the Zylok fiend?

14:26.711 --> 14:32.012
The wind! It carries the Zylok spirit,
which finds the beast within a man,

14:32.023 --> 14:34.031
and emerges at night to kill again.

14:34.055 --> 14:36.316
Gunnar's out there.

14:36.340 --> 14:40.192
We Islanders are strong
to resist the spirit.

14:40.216 --> 14:44.427
But blow-ins, you are vulnerable,
dear friends.

14:46.538 --> 14:48.956
- Who is Sinbad?
- I am.

14:48.979 --> 14:52.396
Gunnar is in terrible danger.
He's accused as the fiend.

14:52.419 --> 14:57.918
Father La Stessa has him at the monastery.
Hurry, please! I'll take you to him.

14:57.942 --> 15:04.171
Call the divine dungeons!
I will reveal the face of darkness.

15:16.372 --> 15:20.127
If I take you any further,
I will be accused of collusion.

15:20.194 --> 15:24.176
- Thank you, Lara.
- Just save him.

15:24.200 --> 15:29.094
Malta was once a friend to strangers.
I pray it will be again.

15:45.827 --> 15:51.325
We'll go for Gunnar.
And you, you find your friend.

15:51.348 --> 15:55.294
- You mean the map.
- In a perfect world, yes.

15:55.317 --> 15:57.807
Well, it's not.

16:06.519 --> 16:10.174
Come on.
Good luck.

16:39.802 --> 16:43.138
Angelico.

16:50.262 --> 16:54.254
It's me, Tiger...

16:55.717 --> 16:57.952
your pupil.

16:59.855 --> 17:05.358
You promised me always a way there
and always a way back.

17:07.503 --> 17:09.969
You were right.

17:10.579 --> 17:16.351
I've seen the world,
and still I find you again.

17:19.132 --> 17:22.618
You can't leave me now.

17:26.738 --> 17:35.357
Ah... the wind
has blown my Tiger to me.

17:47.911 --> 17:52.471
My friend, Sinbad,
is in great need.

17:52.591 --> 17:56.971
Great danger.

17:57.605 --> 18:03.439
There is a map, one of the charts of fable
to Land of the Dead.

18:03.451 --> 18:10.731
Sinbad must go there
to heal the wound that will not heal.

18:12.826 --> 18:16.877
We can see it only for a moment.

18:16.901 --> 18:25.872
No map,
no chart could hold that land.

18:25.895 --> 18:28.441
It exists.

18:28.465 --> 18:30.919
The Order of the Eastern Watch,
they spoke of it.

18:30.942 --> 18:38.178
No map.
None but you will see.

18:40.843 --> 18:45.000
How?
Where is it?

18:45.023 --> 18:52.828
By moonlight and starlight.

18:52.852 --> 18:56.405
What do you mean?

18:56.428 --> 19:03.417
The stars all gather
for another's birth.

19:12.075 --> 19:14.294
The Zylok fiend will come
in human guise.

19:14.317 --> 19:16.233
He will take of the weak
and defile the pure.

19:16.256 --> 19:21.253
The lamb shall quake at his coming
and the hawk shall see him from the air.

19:22.188 --> 19:26.145
The wind has found the wolf within.

19:26.168 --> 19:31.175
Finally we have the beast
in his human form.

19:34.780 --> 19:38.769
The man you have is no beast.
He is Gunnar Halflidarson.

19:38.791 --> 19:41.764
loyal and trusted member
of the <i>Providence</i>.

19:41.788 --> 19:46.176
- Release him.
- Step back before you are removed.

19:55.269 --> 20:02.526
To give this likeness of his inner self
to the son of his victim?

20:02.547 --> 20:04.214
Arrogance.

20:04.238 --> 20:07.914
- The horror!
- But you have no evidence.

20:07.982 --> 20:13.119
Bring forward Lara Assuage.

20:17.758 --> 20:22.150
This is your handkerchief?

20:23.986 --> 20:25.207
It is.

20:25.219 --> 20:28.001
As if this woman would
give such innocence

20:28.013 --> 20:32.248
to a stranger with her husband
lost only months before.

20:32.272 --> 20:36.175
The fiend stole it to suggest
an impossible affection.

20:36.199 --> 20:39.610
- I ga...
- She gave me nothing.

20:39.678 --> 20:43.291
I stole it from her.

20:46.058 --> 20:48.465
That is the only thing you have,
correct?

20:48.476 --> 20:53.443
Darkness ends, put the fiend to death.
Those in agreement, rise.

21:00.710 --> 21:02.342
We arrived only today.

21:02.354 --> 21:05.257
How can he possibly be
responsible for these deaths?

21:05.281 --> 21:11.520
This... creature
is a host for the Zylok spirit.

21:11.544 --> 21:15.192
To destroy the spirit,
one must destroy the host.

21:15.215 --> 21:17.813
No, you are condemning
an innocent man!

21:17.814 --> 21:20.716
He will change as night falls.

21:20.717 --> 21:24.152
Then give me until nightfall
to prove otherwise.

21:24.153 --> 21:28.122
I stake my life upon it.

21:28.190 --> 21:32.459
If you're so sure that you have the fiend,
what have you to lose?

21:32.527 --> 21:36.855
My search will end in failure,
humiliation, my death.

21:36.879 --> 21:43.336
And you will have proved yourself
as merciful as the God that you worship.

21:57.839 --> 22:02.788
To challenge a holy law,
a man must be deranged with his belief.

22:02.789 --> 22:06.190
For this, I pity you.
For this...

22:09.462 --> 22:12.233
I give you till nightfall to
bring me your monster

22:12.256 --> 22:16.730
or, as God is my witness,
I will slay mine.

22:26.415 --> 22:32.012
Angelico, so much sleep,
so many dreams.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.420
Tell me again about the map.

22:36.443 --> 22:40.634
So dark...

22:40.658 --> 22:46.929
And your dreams are at their deepest.
Tell me again.

22:46.997 --> 22:51.804
What more is there to tell,
my child?

22:51.827 --> 22:54.868
Where I will find it?

23:03.412 --> 23:10.235
You will never find it,
you demon.

23:11.595 --> 23:16.233
You were not meant to travel there.

23:55.474 --> 23:58.069
The honeyed ale is off.
A problem with the cask.

23:58.092 --> 24:00.765
- I do have a very good...
- Damn the ale!

24:00.781 --> 24:03.622
How do we find the Zylok fiend?

24:03.646 --> 24:06.396
Philippe, where do we find the fiend?!

24:06.419 --> 24:09.173
- It finds you.
- What does?

24:09.197 --> 24:11.548
Just the monster terrorizing the island.

24:11.571 --> 24:14.645
And Sinbad has decided we
should be the ones to catch it,

24:14.713 --> 24:18.182
- on pain of death.
- There's nothing I'd rather do.

24:18.183 --> 24:21.632
Oh, because you're all so experienced
at finding Zylok fiends?

24:21.655 --> 24:22.907
There is only one.

24:22.919 --> 24:27.874
Yes, I know. I'm making a point.
Am I the only one that favours logic?

24:27.897 --> 24:31.842
We find a pattern to the deaths,
we find where the fiend strikes next,

24:31.866 --> 24:35.142
- we clear Gunnar.
- You have to think like a beast,

24:35.166 --> 24:39.650
- instinct over logic.
- It's an animal thing.

24:54.998 --> 24:58.328
You believe that man in there
is the Zylok fiend?

24:58.352 --> 25:01.463
No, Father. No, I don't.

25:01.745 --> 25:07.628
Then his motive, the theft of your handkerchief,
is even more disturbing, wouldn't you agree?

25:07.629 --> 25:12.399
And if he is not the fiend, then the fiend
is still out there and you are not safe.

25:12.466 --> 25:16.603
You and your boy will stay in
my protection until this is over.

25:34.994 --> 25:39.057
Either the harbourmaster had
a problem with body hair,

25:39.080 --> 25:44.634
or a fiend was here.
This way.

25:45.397 --> 25:47.651
Come on.

26:03.074 --> 26:05.763
Thank you.

26:06.362 --> 26:10.284
Are you in prison
because of me?

26:11.042 --> 26:13.625
This isn't a prison.

26:13.942 --> 26:16.922
This is where my friends,
the mice, tell me stories.

26:16.946 --> 26:18.907
Mice?

26:18.930 --> 26:22.044
You never heard
a mouse tell a story?

26:22.164 --> 26:27.467
Ah. Of course,
you have to listen very carefully.

26:27.490 --> 26:35.777
Tiny voices, and nearly always
about cheese and happy endings.

26:37.653 --> 26:42.817
Go to your room.
Go, Tiar.

26:48.423 --> 26:50.732
Why did you defend me?

26:50.756 --> 26:53.527
Why did you not save yourself?

26:55.464 --> 26:58.294
Gunnar, I need to know.

26:59.198 --> 27:02.631
Tell you what I have never
told a living soul?

27:02.655 --> 27:06.247
Tell me anything that will
show me what you feel.

27:08.595 --> 27:14.829
Six years ago those I loved
were taken in the night,

27:16.449 --> 27:19.934
revenge for my own crimes.

27:19.957 --> 27:24.438
Every day a new pain...

27:24.450 --> 27:30.332
except today,
except with you.

27:36.468 --> 27:39.439
That is what I feel.

27:45.922 --> 27:49.456
Do what you must for yourself.

27:55.775 --> 27:59.356
It will soon be night.

28:04.871 --> 28:07.938
I wanted a fiend by nightfall.

28:08.244 --> 28:10.533
Careful what you wish for.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.778
And I could have been out
bounty hunting.

28:12.802 --> 28:16.637
And here I am going
down a big hole with you.

28:21.605 --> 28:24.153
Sinbad.

28:24.176 --> 28:25.962
Yeah?

28:25.974 --> 28:30.835
The map, it doesn't exist.

28:34.071 --> 28:35.316
It does, we know...

28:35.340 --> 28:39.735
Then we'd need a map to
Angelico's scrambled mind to find it.

28:43.749 --> 28:45.839
Sinbad...

28:53.150 --> 28:57.391
Come on!
Can you unlock it or not?

28:57.755 --> 29:00.721
After all this time,
you still don't trust me.

29:08.397 --> 29:12.556
There was never a thing
I couldn't find before.

29:14.594 --> 29:17.623
Sinbad, I'm sorry.

29:18.504 --> 29:21.541
Maybe it's time I focused on the living.

29:24.820 --> 29:27.450
Gunnar needs us.

29:28.295 --> 29:36.979
It's all contraband he's marked in here:
dangerous weapons, insects, herbs.

29:37.003 --> 29:40.559
Why does he draw attention
to the herb...

29:40.627 --> 29:43.707
Aconitum?
I know that name.

29:46.356 --> 29:48.434
He went missing last night,

29:48.458 --> 29:52.170
when according to this,
he should have been at his post.

29:54.116 --> 29:58.003
This man is meticulous, ordered.

29:59.858 --> 30:02.380
What could be so urgent that
he'd leave his desk?

30:02.447 --> 30:04.215
Bless you.

30:06.248 --> 30:08.596
Maybe he ran out of paper.

30:41.951 --> 30:47.413
The fiend's scent,
it's getting stronger.

30:48.924 --> 30:51.059
It's coming from above.

30:55.598 --> 31:00.024
These are the names of the victims
and the dates they died.

31:00.628 --> 31:04.796
And here,
the day before each death,

31:04.808 --> 31:09.809
a shipment of aconitum arrives.
I think we found he pattern, Rina.

31:09.810 --> 31:13.441
- But what does it mean?
- He knew who was next.

31:17.453 --> 31:21.257
La Stessa.
He was trying to warn him.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.417
Good.
That solves one problem.

31:23.441 --> 31:27.788
It's getting dark.
We need to get to the monastery.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.714
Let's go.

31:36.515 --> 31:39.471
- Philippe.
- Anwar, we have to get to Gunnar!

31:39.538 --> 31:41.371
Oh, these clumsy hands.

31:41.394 --> 31:43.189
No matter how I try,

31:43.207 --> 31:46.894
I still break things,
spoil everything.

31:46.918 --> 31:49.114
Everything is ruined in the end.

32:01.265 --> 32:03.527
- Where did...
- Shh!

32:03.595 --> 32:06.130
- Sinbad, what's going on?
- Shh!

32:07.832 --> 32:10.066
- Where did you...
- Quiet.

32:11.836 --> 32:16.784
It's here.
The scent is at its strongest.

32:23.146 --> 32:25.544
Something else.

32:26.706 --> 32:28.250
Wolfsbane.

32:28.317 --> 32:30.910
Aconitum.

32:30.933 --> 32:33.322
Its common name is wolfsbane.

32:33.346 --> 32:35.811
It's what the harbourmaster was
pulling out of the shipments.

32:35.829 --> 32:39.431
Mages believed that wolfsbane
is irresistible to beasts,

32:39.454 --> 32:42.293
it draws out their hunger.

32:43.179 --> 32:45.751
These aren't random attacks.

32:45.774 --> 32:49.083
Someone is bringing in the herb
to orchestrate the beast.

32:49.106 --> 32:50.943
Someone's directing these attacks.

33:12.659 --> 33:15.985
- It has Gunnar's scent!
- Come on!

33:17.064 --> 33:20.432
On my signal,
bring him through.

33:30.968 --> 33:34.185
Undo my chains
or I'll kill you where you stand.

33:34.208 --> 33:37.226
You are the monster!

33:37.249 --> 33:41.152
No, no.
No, Tiar. No.

33:44.283 --> 33:47.247
You have no chance against the fiend.
Come with me now.

33:47.270 --> 33:49.226
- My horses are waiting...
- I'll never go with you!

33:49.227 --> 33:51.599
When will you see me?

33:51.622 --> 33:55.321
You dismiss me.
For years you gave your name,

33:55.344 --> 34:00.603
your word to a lowly tailor.
And now you give this stranger your heart?

34:00.670 --> 34:04.774
I would have done anything for you!
Anything!

34:05.549 --> 34:09.693
Oh God.
It's you, isn't it?

34:11.043 --> 34:14.835
The fiend, it kills for you.

34:37.572 --> 34:39.716
No!!

34:39.728 --> 34:43.820
Night has come,
and have you seen the beast? No!

34:43.844 --> 34:46.016
Because you control the fiend!

34:46.031 --> 34:48.871
- This man did not steal my handkerchief.
- Lara, no.

34:48.896 --> 34:51.739
I gave it to him willingly.

34:51.763 --> 34:56.326
She's mad with devilish lust!
Continue!

34:56.349 --> 34:59.007
- You're not the monster!
- You know that, don't you?

34:59.031 --> 35:02.129
- Continue!
- But the real one's coming!

35:08.568 --> 35:11.869
Free me!

35:19.111 --> 35:24.689
Now go, go.
Hide yourself! Go!

35:25.850 --> 35:29.219
Gunnar! Run!

35:30.888 --> 35:33.969
I don't run!

35:35.760 --> 35:37.976
Run, run!

36:08.391 --> 36:12.951
Hurry! Hurry!

36:40.721 --> 36:43.400
Your coat,
it's covered in wolfsbane.

36:43.424 --> 36:46.242
- Get rid of it!
- Hurry!

37:02.027 --> 37:03.508
Nice doggy.

37:03.575 --> 37:06.544
Here, boy.

37:16.923 --> 37:20.023
- Where's Tiar?
- Safe.

37:41.161 --> 37:43.755
I don't feel quite myself.

37:45.087 --> 37:47.940
Oh, whoa!
Don't get up.

37:47.963 --> 37:51.568
Really. This is a monastery.
Somebody get a robe.

38:22.065 --> 38:24.867
Goodbye, my dearest friend.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.874
We shall travel together again someday.

38:48.357 --> 38:51.548
Father discovered me one night.

38:53.241 --> 38:56.298
It was only goats at that point.

38:56.322 --> 38:59.539
He promised he would cure me,
said it would be our secret.

38:59.562 --> 39:04.609
But he used you as a weapon
against his enemies, his rivals.

39:05.689 --> 39:08.271
It's a part of you, Philippe.

39:08.823 --> 39:11.610
You have to find a way
to live with it.

39:12.346 --> 39:19.238
I would suggest some sort of cage
for your difficult days.

39:19.263 --> 39:21.024
Anwar,

39:21.247 --> 39:26.712
what a wondrous notion.
Oh, I could hug you!

39:26.735 --> 39:29.951
I'm away to fashion my bars!

40:10.833 --> 40:15.740
You.
How did you find me?

40:15.764 --> 40:21.071
We find everything, Tiger,
if we want it enough.

40:23.026 --> 40:25.750
Tiger.

40:30.927 --> 40:34.943
The map.
I've seen it.

40:34.966 --> 40:39.327
I've seen the way to
the Land of the Dead.

40:42.796 --> 40:45.515
Anwar!

40:45.538 --> 40:50.234
She's seen the map, but it's done
something to her. It's weakened her.

40:50.257 --> 40:53.674
Get her to the ship.

41:23.568 --> 41:28.639
What she's seen had greater impact
than she could've known.

41:29.459 --> 41:31.931
She needs rest.

41:31.954 --> 41:35.630
We're going then?
To Land of the Dead?

41:40.300 --> 41:42.707
Not without me.

41:47.211 --> 41:53.059
That place can hold no fear for us,
if we stay together.

41:53.493 --> 42:00.353
Come. Leave Tiger to restore.
She'll need all her strength.

42:02.690 --> 42:05.974
Couldn't be the Land of Gold
or A Thousand Wishes.

42:05.986 --> 42:08.898
No, we get the Land of the Dead.

42:16.649 --> 42:20.454
To see my brother again...

42:21.104 --> 42:24.368
I'll never be able to thank you.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.114
Rest.
