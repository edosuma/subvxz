00:04.750 --> 00:06.039
You're probably wondering why

00:06.040 --> 00:08.439
I'm not having dinner with y'all.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.099
Honestly, I think that's
the biggest dinner

00:10.100 --> 00:11.940
I've ever seen you have.

00:13.540 --> 00:17.470
This is a pre-dinner, post-lunch snack.

00:17.477 --> 00:19.457
This is "dunch."

00:20.860 --> 00:22.060
And I'm eating light

00:22.065 --> 00:24.099
because John is in my place right now

00:24.100 --> 00:26.020
cooking us a very special dinner.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.529
He said he had something big to ask me.

00:28.530 --> 00:31.199
I bet he's gonna propose. Oh!

00:31.200 --> 00:32.859
Sid's gonna get married.

00:32.860 --> 00:34.490
What?

00:34.494 --> 00:37.950
- Shut up!
- Oh, come on.

00:37.956 --> 00:40.959
He's crazy about you.
He's fixing a special meal.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.939
He has something important to ask you.

00:42.940 --> 00:45.519
- Hello!
- I'm sorry,

00:45.520 --> 00:47.730
but didn't I tell you to shut up?

00:49.320 --> 00:50.779
It's way too soon.

00:50.780 --> 00:52.299
We've only been together six months.

00:52.300 --> 00:56.520
And we've only had sex
182 and a half times.

00:56.536 --> 00:58.704
What was the half time?

00:58.705 --> 01:00.747
It was just good for me.

01:00.748 --> 01:02.680
Stop.

01:02.689 --> 01:04.759
Why are you so afraid of commitment?

01:04.760 --> 01:07.290
- Stop eating. Go back to your...
- No, no, no, no, no, no! Uh-uh.

01:07.297 --> 01:09.739
I am not taking dating
advice from a woman

01:09.740 --> 01:12.210
who's tricking a guy into dating her.

01:13.469 --> 01:15.259
What's this, now?

01:15.260 --> 01:17.640
Well, it's this new
guy I've been seeing.

01:17.650 --> 01:20.099
His name is Richard,
and he went to Harvard,

01:20.100 --> 01:22.399
which, I've got to admit,
was kind of a turn-on.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.930
So, when he asked me where I went,

01:23.938 --> 01:26.359
I just kind of blurted
out Yale. It's just...

01:26.360 --> 01:30.710
it was a tiny little
casual first date lie.

01:30.717 --> 01:32.049
Tiny? Ha.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.879
You didn't even go to college.

01:33.880 --> 01:37.785
You went to Avis Rent-A-Car
front desk girl training school.

01:39.050 --> 01:42.260
And you didn't even graduate!

01:42.980 --> 01:45.269
All right, I really like this guy.

01:45.270 --> 01:47.149
He's smart, he's sophisticated,

01:47.150 --> 01:49.310
and no offense, you guys,
but it's kind of nice

01:49.319 --> 01:53.383
to hang out with someone who
has lived a successful life.

01:53.384 --> 01:55.610
Listen up, everyone.

01:55.617 --> 01:59.839
I, Hank Henderson, do
hereby bequeath to you

01:59.840 --> 02:02.350
my worldly possessions.

02:02.352 --> 02:06.470
To you, Charlie... my
beloved football phone.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.790
Oh...

02:07.795 --> 02:10.401
Now, when you answer
you say, "I'm open."

02:11.068 --> 02:13.720
They won't get it, but you will.

02:14.447 --> 02:16.420
Oh, Hank, I love it, but...

02:16.429 --> 02:17.783
but what's going on?

02:17.784 --> 02:20.661
What, y'all didn't hear? I'm dying.

02:20.662 --> 02:23.060
And to you, Sid...

02:23.061 --> 02:27.480
I give you my cherished
Anquan Boldin jersey.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.690
Oh, thank you, Hank.

02:31.569 --> 02:35.008
I will never wear this.

02:35.009 --> 02:38.512
And last, to my dearest Margaret.

02:38.513 --> 02:42.100
I give you... these.

02:43.540 --> 02:46.350
'Cause, uh... women be shopping.

02:46.354 --> 02:50.420
Mm. Well, I'm insulted,
but I do need hangers.

02:50.421 --> 02:53.040
Uh, does this have anything to do

02:53.049 --> 02:55.862
with that scary little
mole you had tested?

02:55.863 --> 02:57.719
My doctor was supposed to call me

02:57.720 --> 03:00.659
by 5:00 p.m. Friday with the results.

03:00.660 --> 03:02.599
It is now Friday...

03:02.600 --> 03:04.380
5:02.

03:05.812 --> 03:08.418
This is an outrage!

03:09.774 --> 03:11.878
Look, just call me up
and tell me I'm dying.

03:11.879 --> 03:14.214
Hank, you are fine.

03:14.215 --> 03:15.859
Don't let that quack spin you out.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.459
That guy's the worst.

03:17.460 --> 03:20.200
Just like all these doctors,
all they really care about

03:20.201 --> 03:23.473
is money and sunglasses.

03:23.474 --> 03:27.352
Quick question: what?

03:27.353 --> 03:31.169
Our doctor stole my damn sunglasses.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.500
I left them in the lobby,
and then I'm told,

03:33.506 --> 03:35.840
"Oh, they're not in lost and found."

03:35.842 --> 03:38.489
Well, they should check his stupid face.

03:39.940 --> 03:42.639
I can't not know my results
the whole weekend.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.240
I'll have a heart attack.

03:46.180 --> 03:49.359
I want a big funeral, y'all.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.480
Give me the works.

03:50.481 --> 03:53.639
Oh, Hank. Settle down.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.999
Just stop by my place. I'll
give you a couple of Xanax.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.559
Oh, sure. Let's just
throw pill addiction

03:58.560 --> 03:59.959
into the mix, huh?

03:59.960 --> 04:02.179
No, no. Screw that.

04:02.180 --> 04:04.529
You know, doctors can't
treat people like this.

04:04.530 --> 04:06.000
We're going down to his office.

04:06.010 --> 04:08.540
Yes, it is time to take a stand.

04:08.541 --> 04:11.880
Yes, a stand against sunglass thievery.

04:12.940 --> 04:14.629
You told him...

04:14.630 --> 04:16.959
you... went to Yale.

04:45.740 --> 04:48.739
I think what, uh, Fitzgerald

04:48.740 --> 04:52.350
was ultimately trying to say is

04:52.355 --> 04:54.289
that class is a...

04:54.290 --> 04:55.739
an illusion.

04:55.740 --> 04:57.380
Now, wouldn't you agree?

04:58.560 --> 05:00.360
- Totally.
- Hmm.

05:00.363 --> 05:01.960
Yeah, it's like,

05:01.969 --> 05:03.550
"Where are you, class?"

05:03.554 --> 05:06.589
"Here, boy. Yoo-hoo. Class!"

05:06.590 --> 05:08.659
But it's not there.

05:08.660 --> 05:10.989
Because it's an illusion.

05:10.990 --> 05:12.919
You know, his full name was

05:12.920 --> 05:14.849
F. Scott Fitzgerald, so...

05:14.850 --> 05:16.240
Uh...

05:18.194 --> 05:19.506
Boy.

05:19.507 --> 05:21.739
I'm really slumming it

05:21.740 --> 05:23.320
- with you tonight.
- What?

05:23.324 --> 05:24.929
What do you mean? Why do you say that?

05:24.930 --> 05:27.439
Well, y-you know, because, uh...

05:27.440 --> 05:29.280
I'm dating a Yalie.

05:29.288 --> 05:30.660
Oh, yeah, right.

05:30.665 --> 05:32.370
Big ol' Yale head here.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.397
And you went to Harvard.

05:34.398 --> 05:38.659
So, you're jokingly saying
that Yale is below Harvard,

05:38.660 --> 05:42.189
which I guess makes me pretty angry.

05:45.324 --> 05:48.159
You are so cute when you get angry.

05:48.160 --> 05:52.239
You should see me at the post office.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.139
You know, I have no problem

05:54.140 --> 05:56.619
with Harvard being under Yale tonight,

05:56.620 --> 05:58.370
if you catch my drift.

05:58.379 --> 06:01.020
Oh, your drift has been caught.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.400
Mm.

06:02.405 --> 06:04.552
You're talking about doing it, right?

06:09.640 --> 06:11.259
Oh, my God, John.

06:11.260 --> 06:14.436
My friends had the craziest
theory that tonight,

06:14.437 --> 06:15.870
you were gonna...

06:15.877 --> 06:17.898
Oh, damn it.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.650
What's wrong?

06:22.967 --> 06:25.429
Did you dunch?

06:25.430 --> 06:28.220
Yep. That's the problem.

06:28.222 --> 06:31.180
I brunched, lunched and dunched.

06:31.183 --> 06:34.539
Maybe we scratch dinner
and just watch a movie.

06:34.540 --> 06:35.729
In silence.

06:35.730 --> 06:37.719
Maybe one of those rom-coms where

06:37.720 --> 06:40.360
people get married, it
just ruins their lives.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.730
I made a paella.

06:43.738 --> 06:45.255
I've been planning this for days.

06:45.256 --> 06:46.699
For days?

06:46.700 --> 06:49.739
John, who plans a dinner for days?

06:49.740 --> 06:51.800
I'm dating a psychopath.

06:51.807 --> 06:54.370
You should be committed.

06:54.373 --> 06:55.660
Unless you're afraid of commitment,

06:55.666 --> 06:57.646
which I am not.

06:57.647 --> 07:00.024
Can we just sit down
and enjoy this dinner?

07:07.260 --> 07:10.060
Now I'm kind of nervous.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.659
But there's something that I...

07:12.660 --> 07:14.269
- really want to ask you.
- Wait.

07:14.270 --> 07:16.100
Uh...

07:16.110 --> 07:17.560
need to wash your hands.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.350
Can't eat dinner with dirty hands.

07:19.357 --> 07:21.230
What, were you born in a barn?

07:21.233 --> 07:22.939
Actually, I was.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.959
Um, the way Papa tells it,

07:24.960 --> 07:26.360
Mama was milking a cow when the first...

07:26.364 --> 07:29.552
Just wash your friggin' hands!

07:29.553 --> 07:31.110
And when you...

07:31.118 --> 07:32.490
come back...

07:32.495 --> 07:34.015
you can ask me whatever it was

07:34.016 --> 07:36.240
that you wanted to ask me.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.771
I have got to get out of here.

07:46.946 --> 07:48.930
Hell yeah.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.100
Damn.

08:00.106 --> 08:01.959
Everybody's gone home.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.759
Now how am I gonna see my results?

08:03.760 --> 08:07.486
Well, lucky for you, I
brought this brick.

08:07.487 --> 08:11.039
Charlie, we're not gonna throw a
brick through the glass door.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.599
What if it sets off the alarm?

08:12.600 --> 08:16.420
Well, then we can use the
brick to smash the alarm.

08:21.340 --> 08:23.539
Well, another way we could
use the brick would be...

08:23.540 --> 08:26.630
We're not using the brick.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.134
Or are we?

08:33.806 --> 08:36.849
All right, I'm out of ideas.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.360
Oh. Good evening.

08:39.370 --> 08:42.558
Um, I locked my brick in the office,

08:42.559 --> 08:44.520
and I don't have my keys.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.069
You guys doctors?

08:48.382 --> 08:49.613
Yes.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.420
Can't be too careful.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.040
Told you the brick would work.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.630
Hmm.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.131
"Positive."

09:09.132 --> 09:11.090
Well, what the hell does that mean?

09:11.093 --> 09:13.119
Is this a good positive
or a bad positive?

09:13.120 --> 09:14.880
All right, no sign of my sunglasses,

09:14.889 --> 09:17.339
so I took this stethoscope
as collateral.

09:17.340 --> 09:19.600
Charlie, can you read this?

09:19.602 --> 09:21.160
All I can make out is "positive."

09:21.165 --> 09:22.353
Oh, well, that's great.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.679
Uh, positive is good, isn't it?

09:24.680 --> 09:25.959
I mean, is it?

09:25.960 --> 09:28.560
What if I tested positive
for something bad?

09:28.569 --> 09:30.980
Oh, my heart is going crazy.

09:30.988 --> 09:32.940
Oh, let me listen.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.740
Good Lord, man.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.660
You've got no heartbeat at all.

09:37.980 --> 09:39.449
Say, brother.

09:39.450 --> 09:41.400
Look at this.

09:41.410 --> 09:42.874
My man. Can you read this?

09:42.875 --> 09:45.099
I thought you guys were doctors.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.169
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.713
We're just, uh, looking
for a-a third opinion.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.259
Well...

09:53.260 --> 09:55.819
it says here positive, so...

09:55.820 --> 09:57.180
this dude's gonna die.

09:59.183 --> 10:00.760
You hear that, Charlie?

10:00.768 --> 10:02.560
He said I'm gonna die.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.639
Hank, he's the janitor.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.060
He doesn't know.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.990
I prefer custodial engineer.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.980
All right, there's got to be
another way to figure this out.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.219
- Uh...
- Charlie.

10:16.220 --> 10:18.159
I want white doves at my funeral.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.530
If your cheap ass tries
to paint pigeons white,

10:20.538 --> 10:22.454
I will haunt you.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.990
Wait a minute, Hank.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.419
I got the doctor's home
address right here.

10:26.420 --> 10:28.710
Why don't we just go to
his house and ask him?

10:28.712 --> 10:30.000
My man.

10:30.005 --> 10:32.040
- Now you thinking.
- Yeah.

10:32.049 --> 10:35.217
Let's go get my damn sunglasses back.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.260
- Here we are.
- Oh, wow.

10:41.267 --> 10:43.009
Where are my keys?

10:43.010 --> 10:45.680
They're probably under
my library card... s.

10:46.730 --> 10:49.059
- I have several.
- Yeah. Well,

10:49.060 --> 10:51.259
should we just make love right out here

10:51.260 --> 10:52.693
- in the hallway?
- Oh. Oh.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.399
Richard.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.280
- This isn't Princeton.
- No.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.160
Oh! Hi, y'all.

11:01.161 --> 11:04.580
I'm just hiding out from my
boyfriend. I hope that's cool.

11:04.582 --> 11:07.080
I have company, Sid.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.540
Oh, well, don't mind me.

11:08.544 --> 11:10.250
I'll put my headphones on.

11:10.254 --> 11:12.790
Y'all just go to town on each other!

11:12.798 --> 11:15.100
Get buck!

11:24.930 --> 11:26.119
Sid, come here, would you?

11:26.120 --> 11:27.799
Richard, will you excuse me for a moment

11:27.800 --> 11:30.239
while I speak to my
extremely unwelcome friend?

11:30.240 --> 11:31.680
Sure.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.442
I'll just read this...

11:33.443 --> 11:35.569
- US Weekly?
- Oh, that.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.860
That's a joke subscription.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.199
It was a prank from a fellow Yalie.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.242
Oh, yeah.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.720
- Hillary Clinton.
- Ugh.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.170
Sid, that hot hunk of
Harvard man over there

11:50.180 --> 11:53.519
who is reading about Kylie
Jenner's butt secrets

11:53.520 --> 11:56.360
is about to get done. By me.

11:56.370 --> 11:58.129
Go away.

11:58.130 --> 12:01.339
I can't, Margaret. You were right, okay?

12:01.340 --> 12:03.879
John is about to propose.

12:03.880 --> 12:07.679
I just need to buy a little time
till he goes to work at 9:00.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.859
You will not even know I'm here.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.650
What, did you cook something?

12:14.652 --> 12:17.770
No, I want to navigate the
most stressful situation

12:17.780 --> 12:20.239
of my life without popovers.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.150
It's time for you to leave.

12:22.159 --> 12:24.994
Is it?

12:24.995 --> 12:27.959
Or is it time for Richard
to find out about

12:27.960 --> 12:31.040
Little Miss Rent-A-Car dropout?

12:31.050 --> 12:33.002
Oh, you wouldn't.

12:33.003 --> 12:36.720
Oh, but I would.

12:37.820 --> 12:40.690
Don't test me, woman.

12:45.266 --> 12:47.975
Open up, McCormick! We
know you're in there!

12:47.976 --> 12:49.559
Charlie, if this is a bad positive,

12:49.560 --> 12:51.479
I want you to call Seal.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.896
Have him sing at my funeral.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.290
Naturally, I want him to
sing "Kiss from a Rose."

12:56.300 --> 12:58.519
If you could get him to
sing "Kiss from a Hank,"

12:58.520 --> 12:59.779
that'd be ideal.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.906
But I hear he's very
possessive of his lyrics.

13:01.907 --> 13:06.080
Come on, McCormick, open up!

13:08.163 --> 13:09.955
Who the hell are you two?

13:09.956 --> 13:13.542
Don't be alarmed, ma'am.
We don't have a brick.

13:13.543 --> 13:17.004
Why would you say that?
That is super alarming.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.179
Um, we're your husband's patients.

13:19.180 --> 13:20.990
We need to talk to him about
something very important.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.300
It's a matter of life and death.

13:22.303 --> 13:24.049
And sunglasses.

13:24.050 --> 13:25.319
He's not here.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.359
- He's working late at the office.
- No, he's not.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.839
We were just there.

13:28.840 --> 13:32.019
There's no one but a weird
custodial engineer.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.600
Wait, what?

13:34.606 --> 13:37.858
That lying, cheating bastard.

13:37.859 --> 13:40.520
He promised me his secretary
was the last one.

13:40.529 --> 13:42.570
You know what? I'm done.

13:42.573 --> 13:44.609
This marriage is over!

13:44.610 --> 13:47.840
Yeah, well, you seem to
have a lot on your plate.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.700
But real quick,

13:50.706 --> 13:52.499
can you read your husband's handwriting?

13:52.500 --> 13:54.340
Look, the man is a coward.

13:54.350 --> 13:56.669
If he didn't call you by 5:00,

13:56.670 --> 13:59.214
it's probably pretty bad.

14:03.420 --> 14:05.760
So, third date, second location.

14:05.770 --> 14:07.550
Things must be going well.

14:07.556 --> 14:11.892
I mean, tell me if I'm wrong,
but I don't think I am.

14:11.893 --> 14:14.599
- Uh...
- You don't have to answer his questions.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.819
He was just about to leave, anyway.

14:16.820 --> 14:21.140
Margaret, would you sing the
Yale fight song for us?

14:22.779 --> 14:26.198
I forgot how it goes.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.429
Well, Sid, if I sing the fight song,

14:28.430 --> 14:30.954
I'm afraid that I might want to fight!

14:31.880 --> 14:35.140
Uh, you know, I think
I'm gonna head out.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.620
Yeah, Richie, that
might be for the best.

14:37.628 --> 14:40.421
There's a lot going on here.

14:40.422 --> 14:43.559
Richard, stay. Sid, this is insane.

14:43.560 --> 14:46.760
You can't hide here forever
pounding popovers.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.349
If you think John is moving too fast,

14:50.350 --> 14:51.680
just tell him that.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.267
Be an adult.

14:53.268 --> 14:55.936
Damn it. You're right.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.429
I have been a child.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.979
John is my partner.

14:58.980 --> 15:01.442
We can rationally discuss this.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.579
Margaret, it's John.

15:03.580 --> 15:05.360
Is Sid in there?

15:05.363 --> 15:08.240
Oh! Oh! He is relentless!

15:08.242 --> 15:10.110
He's trying to propose to me!

15:10.119 --> 15:12.162
Richard, do something!

15:14.498 --> 15:16.580
I was never here.

15:21.600 --> 15:25.400
Everything's getting banged
around here except me.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.680
Did I just hear Sid screaming?

15:35.686 --> 15:38.239
Well, Margaret, it's been fun.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.889
Well, not really. Dinner w-was fun.

15:40.890 --> 15:42.040
But since then,

15:42.050 --> 15:44.943
it's gotten really weird!

15:44.944 --> 15:46.939
You know what? Just let
me get rid of these guys,

15:46.940 --> 15:48.400
and then you and I are gonna play

15:48.407 --> 15:50.780
the most exciting Harvard-Yale game yet.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.242
You feel me?

15:52.243 --> 15:53.869
Yep.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.370
- Hi. Is Sid here?
- Nope. Catch you later.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.380
Son of a bitch loves to knock
on the door, doesn't he?

16:05.381 --> 16:07.170
All right, all right.

16:07.176 --> 16:09.384
But if it comes up, I went to Yale.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.879
Okay.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.719
See? Sid's not here.

16:14.720 --> 16:18.102
I followed a trail of
paella to your apartment.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.859
And I smell popovers.

16:20.860 --> 16:22.564
That can't all be a coincidence.

16:22.565 --> 16:26.270
Uh, I just made a batch because
Richard here loves 'em.

16:26.278 --> 16:30.079
- I don't love popovers.
- You do. You love popovers.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.319
Say that you love popovers.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.040
- Say it!
- I-I...

16:33.050 --> 16:35.780
Margaret, I'm gonna take
you up on that Xanax...

16:35.787 --> 16:37.121
Dr. McCormick?

16:38.644 --> 16:41.159
- Hank?
- Wait, so you're their doctor?

16:41.160 --> 16:44.660
Yes. He's my most annoying patient.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.789
Can I get an answer on Sid?!

16:47.790 --> 16:49.640
- He's in the bathroom.
- He's in the bathroom.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.511
What are you doing here?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.179
He's on a date with me.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.180
Well, that's weird, 'cause
we were just at his house

16:56.183 --> 16:57.891
and talked to his wife.

16:57.892 --> 17:00.978
Your what?

17:00.979 --> 17:03.647
- You talked to my wife?
- Ooh!

17:03.648 --> 17:07.568
Hearing you say "wife" makes
me think you have one.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.440
Well, he does. For now.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.488
She's very angry.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.781
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Just calm down.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.034
Calm down? I'm gonna
punch you in the head.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.079
I'm gonna punch him in the head first.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.040
Dr. McCormick, you got to tell
people that they're dying.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.679
If you don't and they steal
their files from your office,

17:23.680 --> 17:25.419
you got to make those records more clear

17:25.420 --> 17:27.500
so they know what their results are.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.170
There's no one in the bathroom!

17:30.174 --> 17:32.290
Oh, you're still here? Go look again.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.010
He's small. Maybe you missed him.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.138
Is Sid here or not?!

17:48.735 --> 17:51.738
Margaret didn't go to Yale.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.639
Sid,

18:00.640 --> 18:03.999
what the hell were you
doing in the ceiling?

18:04.000 --> 18:07.110
I wanted to surprise you?

18:07.129 --> 18:09.059
I can't believe

18:09.060 --> 18:11.880
you lied to me about going to Yale.

18:11.883 --> 18:15.420
I lied to you? You're married.

18:15.429 --> 18:19.598
And, apparently, he's
banging his secretary, too.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.059
Look, I've already said I'm sorry.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.719
No, you haven't.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.739
Everybody shut up!

18:26.740 --> 18:28.959
You said you were gonna
call me, and you didn't.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.559
Am I good positive or bad positive?

18:31.560 --> 18:33.840
I left you a voice mail.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.450
Oh, yeah, there it is.

18:39.828 --> 18:42.619
Damn phones.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.839
Your tests came back clean.

18:44.840 --> 18:45.849
They did?

18:45.850 --> 18:47.580
- Yes.
- Thank God.

18:47.586 --> 18:49.270
You saved my life.

18:49.274 --> 18:51.750
Cancel Seal, Charlie.
I'm gonna live forever.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.259
Oh.

18:55.260 --> 18:59.270
Margaret, this man is a keeper.

18:59.920 --> 19:03.319
He's married. Oh, I wasted a lot of time

19:03.320 --> 19:05.720
studying for our dates. Get out of here.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.559
Gladly.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.940
Oh, not so fast, bub.

19:11.026 --> 19:13.860
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

19:13.862 --> 19:17.120
- Ooh.
- Just as I thought.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.769
Go home and fix your marriage,

19:22.770 --> 19:24.997
you quack bastard.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.449
Ugh!

19:28.450 --> 19:31.379
Some people, am I right?

19:31.380 --> 19:33.339
Welp, I got to go get some shut-eye.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.965
Sid.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.790
Why do you keep running away from me?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.019
What's going on?

19:38.020 --> 19:39.120
The truth.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.739
I knew you were gonna propose to me,

19:42.740 --> 19:45.390
- and I just... lost it.
- What?

19:45.393 --> 19:47.520
Propose?

19:47.521 --> 19:49.559
No, I...

19:49.560 --> 19:51.469
I booked a three-month gig in Hawaii,

19:51.470 --> 19:53.179
and I-I wanted you to come.

19:53.180 --> 19:55.270
I already bought the tickets.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.820
Oh, my gosh, Hawaii.

19:57.823 --> 19:59.320
Yeah.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.319
I was wrong.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.920
Egg on my face.

20:05.780 --> 20:08.449
Oh, yeah, this is gonna be so much fun.

20:08.450 --> 20:09.750
When are we going?

20:09.751 --> 20:12.627
You thought I might propose
to you, and it caused you

20:12.628 --> 20:15.249
to crawl around in Margaret's ceiling?

20:15.250 --> 20:18.700
Like a miniature Bruce Willis?

20:20.262 --> 20:23.138
I don't think that's a
good sign. Do you?

20:23.139 --> 20:25.590
Well, nothing that a three-month stint

20:25.600 --> 20:27.809
in Hawaii can't fix.

20:27.810 --> 20:31.380
Aloha, John.

20:32.740 --> 20:34.950
Aloha, Sid.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.069
Oh, yeah, right.

20:39.070 --> 20:42.480
'Cause it means "good-bye," too.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.701
Oh, that's rough, buddy.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.659
I'm sorry.

20:46.660 --> 20:48.739
But if it makes you feel any better,

20:48.740 --> 20:52.400
I look awesome in these, don't I?

20:54.045 --> 20:57.319
Well, Sid, maybe you'll find love again.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.079
Or maybe you won't. What do I care?

20:59.080 --> 21:01.300
I got my life back!

21:04.180 --> 21:07.719
Margaret, how am I gonna fix

21:07.720 --> 21:10.579
this John-shaped hole in my heart?

21:10.580 --> 21:13.350
Oh, sweetie. We'll figure it out.

21:13.356 --> 21:18.440
Right after you fix the
Sid-shaped hole in my ceiling.

21:18.460 --> 21:20.399
How did you get up there, anyway?

21:20.400 --> 21:22.269
Oh, it was easy. I
crawled up on the sink,

21:22.270 --> 21:24.619
and then I just pulled
myself up in the ceiling.

21:24.620 --> 21:26.190
Here, come on. I'll show you.
