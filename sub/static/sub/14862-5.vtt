00:01.067 --> 00:03.406
Previously on "mistresses"...

00:04.235 --> 00:06.538
Thomas said that's why you
gave him the prescription...

00:06.538 --> 00:08.606
For when things got too painful.

00:08.606 --> 00:11.943
How would you describe the
mental state of your patient

00:11.943 --> 00:13.411
in the weeks leading up to his death?

00:13.411 --> 00:15.513
You think that I let
Sally walk all over me,

00:15.513 --> 00:16.715
and you know what? You're right.

00:16.715 --> 00:18.283
You're a good friend, Joss.

00:18.283 --> 00:19.784
Six months ago, I lost my job,

00:19.784 --> 00:21.319
but this isn't about me anymore.

00:21.319 --> 00:22.320
It's about Scottie.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.488
He needs your help.

00:23.488 --> 00:25.657
There's a recently developed paternity test

00:25.657 --> 00:28.493
that only requires a D.N.A.
sample from the mother

00:28.493 --> 00:30.395
and potential father.

02:01.446 --> 02:04.349
I had that horrible dream again.

02:04.349 --> 02:07.932
I was trapped inside a giant
mummy's foot with Madonna,

02:07.932 --> 02:09.934
and she wouldn't stop singing.

02:09.934 --> 02:12.837
I hate that dream, on many levels.

02:12.837 --> 02:14.806
Well, I reached over to find
you, but you weren't there.

02:14.806 --> 02:16.941
Oh. I'm sorry, babe.

02:16.941 --> 02:20.511
Just been up since 5:00 trying
to get through this work.

02:20.511 --> 02:21.546
Mm.

02:21.546 --> 02:23.481
And now I'm running late, so...

02:23.481 --> 02:24.782
- Uh-huh.
- Mmm.

02:24.782 --> 02:26.017
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

02:26.017 --> 02:28.186
Whoa. Whoa. Come here.

02:28.186 --> 02:29.787
Hmm?

02:29.787 --> 02:30.822
Your breath.

02:30.822 --> 02:32.523
Oh, no. Is it bad?

02:32.523 --> 02:33.858
No. No. No. It's just...
it's... it's different.

02:33.858 --> 02:35.681
My breath is different?

02:35.681 --> 02:36.983
Yeah. It's weird.

02:36.983 --> 02:38.651
You been chewing on pennies or something?

02:38.651 --> 02:40.353
- What?
- Yeah.

02:40.353 --> 02:42.088
- Okay, now you are freaking me out.
- No. Come on. Kiss me again.

02:42.088 --> 02:43.589
- Oh.
- Just once.

02:45.658 --> 02:46.659
Uh-huh.

02:46.659 --> 02:48.527
Uh-huh. Okay.

Bye.

02:50.763 --> 02:51.764
Love you.

(Chuckles)

02:54.467 --> 02:56.402
(Knock on door)

02:56.402 --> 02:57.803
Hello!

02:57.803 --> 02:59.305
I know I'm late but...

02:59.305 --> 03:01.340
Oh! Ooh! I'm sorry. I'll wait outside.

03:01.340 --> 03:03.342
Oh, Alex, don't be silly.

03:03.342 --> 03:04.777
He's out cold. See?

03:07.079 --> 03:08.447
That's impressive.

03:08.447 --> 03:09.982
Mm-hmm.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.551
Well, it looks like you guys
had a lot of fun last night.

03:12.551 --> 03:13.786
Yeah, as much fun as you can have

03:13.786 --> 03:15.688
with someone that only watches cartoons.

03:15.688 --> 03:16.956
When they're that pretty,

03:16.956 --> 03:18.391
generally, they're not that interesting.

03:18.391 --> 03:19.725
Doesn't bother you?

03:19.725 --> 03:22.328
Mm. It's a trade-off. So how are you?

03:22.328 --> 03:23.396
You know, I'm okay.

03:23.396 --> 03:25.398
Are you still breaking up with Sally?

03:25.398 --> 03:27.033
Because it's been, like, a week.

03:27.033 --> 03:29.301
Well, we were together for five years.

03:29.301 --> 03:31.037
I mean, you know, there's a lot of history.

03:31.037 --> 03:33.906
Yeah, but how many times can
you have the same conversation

03:33.906 --> 03:35.341
over and over and over again?

03:35.341 --> 03:37.443
It's never exactly the same.

03:37.443 --> 03:39.378
Oh, but it doesn't matter anyways.

03:39.378 --> 03:40.646
Sally and I are

03:40.646 --> 03:44.784
officially, officially
over as of last night.

03:44.784 --> 03:47.019
Oh, sweetheart.

03:47.019 --> 03:49.855
I'm sorry. Now I feel
like a jerk. Are you okay?

03:49.855 --> 03:51.524
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

03:51.524 --> 03:54.060
It's hard, you know, but I know
it was the right thing to do.

03:55.394 --> 03:56.862
I'm moving out tomorrow.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.564
(Gasps) You found a place already?

03:58.564 --> 04:02.001
Mm-hmm. It's not great. I
really can't afford much,

04:02.001 --> 04:03.335
but it's close to the yoga studio,

04:03.335 --> 04:06.405
and I was wondering if you wouldn't mind

04:06.405 --> 04:08.507
helping me move my stuff.

04:08.507 --> 04:09.542
Of course.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.077
(Chuckles)

04:11.077 --> 04:12.845
And, you know, if you're too sad to hike,

04:12.845 --> 04:14.547
I totally understand.

04:14.547 --> 04:16.982
Not so fast, lazybones.

04:16.982 --> 04:19.385
(Flaps lips) Mm.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.356
Ugh. I hate when you're
silent. Whenever you're silent,

04:24.356 --> 04:26.025
it means I have less money than I thought.

04:28.961 --> 04:30.596
You have less money than you thought.

04:30.596 --> 04:31.997
W... how can that be?

04:31.997 --> 04:34.600
What happened to the $500,000
from Paul's life insurance?

04:34.600 --> 04:36.001
Well, a big chunk went to cover

04:36.001 --> 04:37.970
the debts you accrued
over the last three years.

04:37.970 --> 04:39.805
You sunk a large sum into the shop.

04:39.805 --> 04:41.907
To build a business so that
I could settle those debts.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.043
I mean, not to mention
make a life for myself...

04:44.043 --> 04:45.811
on your advice, I might add.

04:45.811 --> 04:48.013
You're my most responsible client, April.

04:48.013 --> 04:49.682
You've done all the right things,

04:49.682 --> 04:54.053
but we knew it would be tight
until the store really took off.

04:54.053 --> 04:56.088
So why do you need this money anyway?

04:57.188 --> 04:58.624
There's this friend

04:58.624 --> 05:00.392
who's going through some tough times.

05:00.392 --> 05:03.863
She asked for a loan. I want to help.

05:03.863 --> 05:07.399
Well, you could pull money
out of Lucy's college fund,

05:07.399 --> 05:08.767
but there are penalties.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.002
Absolutely not. I'm not
touching Lucy's money.

05:10.002 --> 05:12.571
We'll just have to find it somewhere else.

05:12.571 --> 05:13.973
How good a friend are
we talking about here?

05:16.008 --> 05:17.910
It's not so much for the friend.

05:17.910 --> 05:20.379
I... oh.

05:20.379 --> 05:21.914
She has a kid, okay?

05:21.914 --> 05:23.916
An innocent kid. He's only 3,

05:23.916 --> 05:26.318
and she can't afford
a decent school for him

05:26.318 --> 05:28.921
- or health insurance.
- (Cell phone rings)

05:28.921 --> 05:30.022
Excuse me.

05:31.924 --> 05:33.526
Hello?

05:33.526 --> 05:35.561
Yes, this is Lucy's mom.

05:35.561 --> 05:36.929
Is everything okay?

05:38.804 --> 05:40.205
I'm coming right now.

05:40.205 --> 05:42.074
What is it? What's wrong?

05:42.074 --> 05:45.511
Uh, Lucy didn't show up for school today.

05:45.511 --> 05:49.114
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to go.

05:49.114 --> 05:50.716
(Lila) Oh, she's here.

05:50.716 --> 05:54.019
It's about time. I've been
waiting for about eight minutes.

05:54.019 --> 05:55.454
Why? What's been going on?

05:55.454 --> 05:57.523
You've been asked to be the keynote speaker

05:57.523 --> 06:00.225
at the N.A.F.P.A. center
for mental health symposium.

06:00.225 --> 06:02.761
"To honor your work in
extending mental health

06:02.761 --> 06:04.163
and developmental services

06:04.163 --> 06:06.865
to the diverse communities of Los Angeles.

06:06.865 --> 06:10.035
Other participants include
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa,

06:10.035 --> 06:12.638
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton"...

06:12.638 --> 06:15.574
(Gasps) Oh, my God. Hillary Clinton?

06:15.574 --> 06:16.675
- Mm-hmm.
- I know!

06:16.675 --> 06:17.710
I can't believe...

06:17.710 --> 06:19.745
Are you sure this was meant for me?

06:19.745 --> 06:21.146
As much as I'd love to take credit,

06:21.146 --> 06:23.215
I'm pretty sure I'm not the one

06:23.215 --> 06:25.984
who "launched the first
program for Korean immigrants,

06:25.984 --> 06:27.019
which was used as a"...

06:27.019 --> 06:28.821
"As a model for similar initiatives

06:28.821 --> 06:30.089
in non-English-speaking communities

06:30.089 --> 06:31.757
in Southern California."

06:31.757 --> 06:34.693
Well, when you say it like that,
it does sound pretty impressive.

06:34.693 --> 06:36.662
Congratulations, Dr. Kim.

06:36.662 --> 06:37.930
It is an incredible honor,

06:37.930 --> 06:39.765
and richly deserved, I might add.

06:39.765 --> 06:41.800
Nice try, Lila, but I'm
gonna be her plus-one.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.502
Major crush on Hillary.

06:43.597 --> 06:44.865
Don't ask.

06:44.865 --> 06:46.667
Everyone has their cross to bear.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.602
Am I interrupting something?

06:48.602 --> 06:51.205
Mr. Newsome, what are...

06:51.205 --> 06:53.106
I wasn't expecting you.

06:53.106 --> 06:54.641
I know. Do you have a minute?

07:02.783 --> 07:04.117
Is he a patient?

07:04.117 --> 07:05.953
Nope.

07:05.953 --> 07:07.054
(Elevator bell dings)

07:07.054 --> 07:09.623
(Cell phone rings)

07:09.623 --> 07:11.558
- (Dominic) So the guy actually writes this.
- (Woman laughs)

07:11.558 --> 07:13.894
No, he writes this. He puts it in writing.

07:13.894 --> 07:15.329
Who does that?

07:15.329 --> 07:18.131
(Laughs)

07:18.131 --> 07:19.600
(Dominic speaks indistinctly)

07:19.600 --> 07:21.568
(Cell phone rings)

07:21.568 --> 07:22.836
Hello?

07:22.836 --> 07:24.872
I think I figured out your weird breath.

07:24.872 --> 07:26.139
Okay. You need a hobby.

07:26.139 --> 07:27.708
Get your ass to the gym.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.710
I'm on my way, actually.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.211
But listen to this...

07:31.211 --> 07:34.047
according to this web
site, metallic breath is

07:34.047 --> 07:36.283
one of the potential signs of pregnancy,

07:36.283 --> 07:39.753
along with, um, fatigue, headaches,

07:39.753 --> 07:41.088
and waking up your husband

07:41.088 --> 07:44.992
four times a night to pee.

07:44.992 --> 07:46.860
Oy. You still there?

07:46.860 --> 07:49.062
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

07:49.062 --> 07:50.564
I'm... I'm here.

07:50.564 --> 07:51.665
What do you think?

07:51.665 --> 07:54.134
Well...

07:54.134 --> 07:57.037
I mean, I... I guess it's
definitely a possibility.

07:57.037 --> 07:58.672
Well, given our recent conversations,

07:58.672 --> 08:01.008
I know it might not be exactly
what you want to hear, but...

08:01.008 --> 08:02.676
It's not that, sweetie.

08:02.676 --> 08:05.045
I... I just didn't want you to
get your hopes up all over again.

08:05.045 --> 08:06.713
Babe, my only hope is for us

08:06.713 --> 08:08.882
to be happy, healthy, and in love forever.

08:08.882 --> 08:10.817
Me, too.

08:10.817 --> 08:12.119
I just... I had to tell you.

08:12.119 --> 08:14.555
I mean, what if, right?

08:14.555 --> 08:16.623
(Inhales deeply) Wild.

08:16.623 --> 08:18.759
Anyway, we'll talk more later.

08:18.759 --> 08:19.960
Okay?

08:23.731 --> 08:26.233
You ever considered putting any
chairs in front of your desk?

08:26.233 --> 08:28.268
It might help these conversations.

08:28.268 --> 08:32.339
I'm expecting a patient
any minute, Mr. Newsome.

08:32.339 --> 08:33.941
Why are you here?

08:33.941 --> 08:35.208
There's been a new development

08:35.208 --> 08:36.943
in the Thomas Grey investigation.

08:38.212 --> 08:39.980
What kind of development?

08:39.980 --> 08:42.082
Well, I can't share specifics,
but I'm gonna need your notes

08:42.082 --> 08:44.318
in the months leading
up to Thomas Grey's death

08:44.318 --> 08:46.954
to help clarify his state
of mind before he died.

08:46.954 --> 08:48.288
I already told you his state of mind

08:48.288 --> 08:49.990
the last time you were here.

08:49.990 --> 08:52.059
What can I say? They'd
prefer it in writing.

08:52.059 --> 08:54.261
Well, I'm not comfortable with that.

08:54.261 --> 08:55.763
Why not?

08:55.763 --> 08:58.265
Doctor/patient
confidentiality, for one thing.

08:58.265 --> 08:59.266
I don't want to sound disrespectful,

08:59.266 --> 09:00.834
but the man's dead.

09:00.834 --> 09:03.237
I really don't see him having a problem.

09:03.237 --> 09:07.041
It's a problem because I respect
the privacy of my patients

09:07.041 --> 09:09.009
and the sanctity of
the work I do with them.

09:09.009 --> 09:10.210
Listen, I'm not interested

09:10.210 --> 09:12.012
in anything that doesn't
pertain to this case.

09:12.012 --> 09:14.114
I don't care about the
man's dirty little secrets.

09:15.983 --> 09:18.085
We're done here.

09:21.055 --> 09:23.257
Look, you want me to respect your job.

09:23.257 --> 09:25.626
This is my job. If you
don't want to cooperate,

09:25.626 --> 09:27.261
I have to come back with a subpoena.

09:27.261 --> 09:28.929
I doubt the police would get involved

09:28.929 --> 09:30.631
with a life insurance claim.

09:30.631 --> 09:32.833
That's true, but the new
evidence that we've discovered

09:32.833 --> 09:35.302
may turn this into a
criminal investigation.

09:38.038 --> 09:40.941
Do you still want to
hold on to those notes?

09:40.941 --> 09:43.277
I think I'm gonna have to.

09:52.935 --> 09:57.306
(Sighs)

09:57.306 --> 09:59.007
Naked guy is gone.

09:59.007 --> 10:00.876
And he made the bed. How sweet.

10:00.876 --> 10:04.780
No note. Thank God.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.014
Okay. Mm.

10:06.014 --> 10:08.884
I am gonna hop in the shower.

10:08.884 --> 10:10.719
You pick a place for brunch.

10:10.719 --> 10:12.488
Okay.

Great. Thank you.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.511
Oh. Uh, Principal Anders called me.

11:42.511 --> 11:43.612
My... my... my daughter's Lucy.

11:43.612 --> 11:45.013
Oh. Hi. Yes. I just saw her.

11:45.013 --> 11:45.981
Please have a seat. She'll be with you...

11:45.981 --> 11:47.616
Are you saying she's here?

11:47.616 --> 11:49.551
I... well, do you know if
she's here or don't you?

11:49.551 --> 11:50.619
Principal Anders will
be with you in a moment.

11:50.619 --> 11:51.820
She has the information.

11:51.820 --> 11:53.522
Well, I thought this
was the information desk.

11:53.522 --> 11:54.690
What do you have?

11:54.690 --> 11:56.725
Oh, good. Mrs. Malloy, you're here.

11:56.725 --> 11:57.926
Where's my daughter?

11:57.926 --> 11:59.995
She's safely back in class right now.

11:59.995 --> 12:01.730
Come with me, please.

12:01.730 --> 12:03.565
(Sighs)

12:07.903 --> 12:09.371
What are you doing here?

12:09.371 --> 12:11.633
Madi ditched school with Lucy.

12:11.633 --> 12:13.009
What do you mean, ditched?

12:13.009 --> 12:14.310
He means they cut.

12:14.310 --> 12:17.580
But they're 10. 10 year
olds don't get to cut school.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.315
Where would they even go?

12:19.315 --> 12:20.550
The bookstore on Ventura.

12:20.550 --> 12:22.251
Apparently, Selena Gomez was there

12:22.251 --> 12:23.886
signing her autobiography.

12:23.886 --> 12:25.788
Teenagers don't get to
have autobiographies.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.057
- What is going on here?
- The girls heard

12:28.057 --> 12:30.059
that Sharon Galecki was driving Olivia.

12:30.059 --> 12:32.829
They lied to her and said
we gave our permission.

12:32.829 --> 12:34.297
Sharon Galecki drove them?

12:34.297 --> 12:35.865
At least they were chaperoned.

12:35.865 --> 12:38.968
By a woman who drives a
hummer. Not feeling comforted.

12:38.968 --> 12:41.170
Okay, look, I want to talk
to my daughter immediately.

12:41.170 --> 12:43.606
I think that would be an added disruption

12:43.606 --> 12:44.941
to the rest of the class.

12:44.941 --> 12:46.809
I've already had a long
talk with both of your girls.

12:46.809 --> 12:49.145
I expect you to do the same at home.

12:49.145 --> 12:52.215
And if anything like
this ever happens again,

12:52.215 --> 12:55.318
it will most definitely
be grounds for suspension.

12:55.318 --> 12:57.620
Any questions?

12:59.222 --> 13:01.257
No.

13:01.257 --> 13:02.892
Good.

13:02.892 --> 13:05.228
Sure. I'll hold.

13:05.228 --> 13:08.064
(Woman giggles)

13:08.064 --> 13:09.899
Yes, I'm still here.

13:09.899 --> 13:13.169
I'm calling about my results
to the paternity test.

13:13.169 --> 13:15.238
(Woman laughs)

13:15.238 --> 13:17.106
But how can that be?

13:17.106 --> 13:20.977
No. No. I need the results
sooner than that. Okay?

13:20.977 --> 13:24.113
Please. Please. I... I...
I've spoken to the lab already.

13:24.113 --> 13:26.148
Is there any way that we
could put a rush on this?

13:26.148 --> 13:28.618
I'm willing to pay whatever it takes.

13:28.618 --> 13:31.153
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

13:31.153 --> 13:33.189
Okay.

13:33.189 --> 13:37.059
Okay. Thank you.

13:37.059 --> 13:38.261
Oh, please.

13:38.261 --> 13:41.030
I have one margarita,
and I am so obnoxious.

13:41.030 --> 13:43.099
(Laughs)

13:43.099 --> 13:45.201
Oh, you'd be surprised.

13:45.201 --> 13:47.803
Oh, really? Like, how
obnoxious is obnoxious?

13:47.803 --> 13:49.772
Well... dancing on the
tables obnoxious or...

13:49.772 --> 13:51.040
Excuse me.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.743
Uh, will you do me a favor
and file these motions

13:53.743 --> 13:56.679
in the courthouse in Van Nuys?

13:56.679 --> 13:58.814
The courthouse in Van Nuys?

13:58.814 --> 14:01.083
Yeah. (Chuckles)

14:01.083 --> 14:02.184
Is there a problem?

14:02.184 --> 14:05.221
Well, I'm just new to L.A.,

14:05.221 --> 14:08.724
so I haven't really figured
out the freeways yet.

14:08.724 --> 14:10.159
- They're so scary.
- (Laughs) Yeah.

14:10.159 --> 14:12.728
Oh, I know, but what
an excellent opportunity

14:12.728 --> 14:15.698
for you to overcome those fears, you know?

14:15.698 --> 14:17.133
You'll do great.

14:17.133 --> 14:18.334
You know, if you want
to avoid the freeways,

14:18.334 --> 14:20.202
uh, you should take San
Vicente. I can show her...

14:20.202 --> 14:22.305
She'll be fine. Thank you.

14:22.305 --> 14:23.773
Savannah.

14:23.773 --> 14:25.107
There's a 50-page complaint on my desk

14:25.107 --> 14:28.110
that needs to be read and reviewed by noon.

14:28.110 --> 14:29.679
May I?

14:36.652 --> 14:38.154
Uh, what do we need?

14:38.154 --> 14:39.989
(Speaks indistinctly) Yes.

14:39.989 --> 14:43.626
Uh, this. Oh, this. So good.

14:43.626 --> 14:45.594
Uh... oh. Olives or no olives?

14:45.594 --> 14:47.763
Mm. Eh, olives.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.332
Definitely olives.

14:49.332 --> 14:51.167
But you hate them in your martinis.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.135
Mmm.

14:53.135 --> 14:54.203
(Josslyn) Mmm.

14:54.203 --> 14:56.172
(Speaks indistinctly)

14:56.172 --> 14:59.108
(Mouth full) I'm a purist
when it comes to my gin.

14:59.108 --> 15:00.309
(Laughs) Okay.

15:00.309 --> 15:02.578
Olives it is.

15:02.578 --> 15:03.813
Mmm.

15:05.114 --> 15:07.817
(Giggles)

15:08.985 --> 15:12.154
(Exhales deeply)

15:12.154 --> 15:15.124
So are we gonna talk about this or...

15:16.124 --> 15:17.727
It's totally up to you.

15:17.987 --> 15:20.322
Mm. I generally don't talk.

15:20.322 --> 15:23.092
I noticed.

15:24.193 --> 15:26.862
I feel like I should make an exception

15:26.862 --> 15:27.997
because...

15:27.997 --> 15:28.998
Because I'm a girl?

15:28.998 --> 15:30.065
That,

15:30.065 --> 15:31.200
yeah, sure,

15:31.200 --> 15:33.402
and, um, yes.

15:33.402 --> 15:35.404
(Mouth full) Let's start there. Okay?

15:35.404 --> 15:37.506
You're not gay.

15:37.506 --> 15:40.876
(Giggles)

15:40.876 --> 15:42.978
Despite what just happened,

15:42.978 --> 15:46.348
which, to be honest, was pretty gay,

15:46.348 --> 15:48.083
when it comes to my sexual orientation,

15:48.083 --> 15:51.020
I'm... (Whistles) straight.

15:51.020 --> 15:53.555
I love me some penis.

15:53.555 --> 15:55.190
(Laughs)

15:55.190 --> 15:56.592
Yeah, I know.

15:56.592 --> 15:58.160
Also, I don't do relationships.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.161
I know.

15:59.161 --> 16:00.596
I just want to be up-front with you.

16:00.596 --> 16:03.299
Listen, I just got out
of a 5-year relationship,

16:03.299 --> 16:04.833
so I'm...

16:04.833 --> 16:07.036
I'm not ready to jump into anything.

16:07.036 --> 16:08.304
- That's what I figured.
- Mm-hmm.

16:08.304 --> 16:10.406
I just wanted to confirm that this was,

16:10.406 --> 16:13.876
like, a... a rebound thing then, right?

16:13.876 --> 16:15.444
Joss.

16:15.444 --> 16:17.346
You are my friend,

16:17.346 --> 16:20.249
and I think you're absolutely gorgeous.

16:21.250 --> 16:23.919
Well, back at ya.

16:23.919 --> 16:25.321
Both counts.

16:25.321 --> 16:26.955
And what happened between
us... that was, uh...

16:26.955 --> 16:28.190
Mm.

16:28.190 --> 16:30.993
- That was fun. Right?
- It was. Yeah.

16:30.993 --> 16:31.994
I had fun.

16:31.994 --> 16:33.028
Mm.

16:33.028 --> 16:34.229
Me, too.

16:34.229 --> 16:36.265
So it can just be that?

16:36.265 --> 16:38.267
Absolutely.

16:38.267 --> 16:40.302
Fun is what I do best.

16:40.302 --> 16:41.570
Mm.

16:41.570 --> 16:43.605
I know that, too.

16:47.312 --> 16:50.449
Thank you.

16:50.449 --> 16:53.485
I didn't want to have this
conversation over the phone.

16:53.485 --> 16:55.387
What's going on? Is it Sam?

16:55.387 --> 16:57.389
No. No.

16:57.389 --> 16:59.091
This is about...

17:01.593 --> 17:04.530
did you ever meet with Anthony Newsome?

17:04.530 --> 17:06.298
He's the investigator...

17:06.298 --> 17:08.534
From the life insurance company.

17:08.534 --> 17:11.103
Yeah, he came to my house a while ago.

17:11.103 --> 17:12.371
Why?

17:12.371 --> 17:14.239
He came to me, too.

17:14.239 --> 17:15.674
And then came back again today

17:15.674 --> 17:19.377
asking for copies of my notes
from my sessions with Thomas.

17:19.377 --> 17:22.146
Why? I mean, why is he asking for them now?

17:22.146 --> 17:23.281
It's been weeks.

17:23.281 --> 17:25.483
He wouldn't tell me anything specific,

17:25.483 --> 17:28.420
just that there is new information

17:28.420 --> 17:31.990
that could potentially turn this
into a criminal investigation.

17:31.990 --> 17:35.460
Do you have any idea what that could be?

17:38.664 --> 17:41.266
That must be why Cora called me.

17:41.266 --> 17:42.367
Cora? Who's Cora?

17:42.367 --> 17:43.735
She was the hospice nurse

17:43.735 --> 17:46.371
who was on duty the night tom passed away.

17:46.371 --> 17:48.273
What information could a hospice nurse have

17:48.273 --> 17:50.342
that could affect his investigation?

17:50.342 --> 17:52.210
I have no idea.

17:52.210 --> 17:53.679
I dismissed Cora early that night,

17:53.679 --> 17:56.448
so she wasn't even there when it happened.

17:56.448 --> 17:57.749
You did what?

17:57.749 --> 18:00.052
I let her go home early so
tom and I could be alone.

18:00.052 --> 18:01.687
You didn't think that
would raise suspicion?

18:01.687 --> 18:05.057
Obviously, I wasn't in my right mind.

18:05.057 --> 18:08.327
(Lowered voice) You may recall
I was about to kill my husband

18:08.327 --> 18:10.395
with the drugs you so kindly provided.

18:10.395 --> 18:13.098
It's possible I wasn't thinking straight.

18:13.098 --> 18:14.333
Elizabeth.

18:14.333 --> 18:17.269
Just exactly how much does this woman know?

18:17.269 --> 18:20.405
We have to talk about this.

18:32.556 --> 18:34.191
Morning.

18:34.191 --> 18:35.760
Hi.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.696
You look gorgeous today.

18:38.696 --> 18:40.364
I do?

18:40.364 --> 18:42.233
You weren't gonna slip out
without saying good-bye,

18:42.233 --> 18:43.434
were you?

18:43.434 --> 18:44.702
Oh, honey, you were sleeping so soundly.

18:44.702 --> 18:45.703
I didn't want to wake you.

18:45.703 --> 18:47.505
Wait. Before you go...

18:51.275 --> 18:53.144
Got something.

18:55.780 --> 18:58.382
- Wow. A pregnancy test.
- Yeah.

18:58.382 --> 18:59.550
I mean, I know you're on
your way to work, so...

18:59.550 --> 19:00.785
I have a meeting in 20 minutes.

19:00.785 --> 19:01.752
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We can do it later.

19:01.752 --> 19:03.354
Okay.

19:03.354 --> 19:04.789
There's no pressure, babe.

19:04.789 --> 19:06.657
Really.

19:06.657 --> 19:08.492
We can do it tonight.

19:13.197 --> 19:15.800
My Lucy cutting school?

19:15.800 --> 19:18.569
I can't remember being
this mad at her ever.

19:18.569 --> 19:21.739
I'm not so thrilled
with this Sharon Galecki.

19:21.739 --> 19:24.208
Oh. I already had words with Mrs. Galecki.

19:24.248 --> 19:27.618
She won't be participating
in carpool anymore.

19:27.618 --> 19:29.786
Then my business manager tells me

19:29.786 --> 19:32.422
that despite the big old
check, I'm still broke.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.090
You're not broke, just not liquid.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.258
What's the difference?

19:35.258 --> 19:37.093
I still have to find a
way to pay child support

19:37.093 --> 19:38.428
for Miranda's damn son

19:38.428 --> 19:41.197
when what I really want to
do is kick her in the neck.

19:41.197 --> 19:42.398
Maybe you should.

19:42.398 --> 19:45.768
What kind of freaky shrink are you?

19:45.768 --> 19:47.303
I don't mean kick her.
I mean, kick something.

19:47.303 --> 19:50.339
Get it out. Express the anger.

19:50.339 --> 19:52.208
Yeah, I don't really do that.

19:52.208 --> 19:55.011
I do. I kick-boxed for
over an hour yesterday.

19:55.011 --> 19:56.345
Felt great.

19:56.345 --> 19:57.180
Who are you mad at?

19:57.180 --> 19:59.248
Myself mostly,

19:59.248 --> 20:02.919
for being such an idiot.

20:02.919 --> 20:05.054
Why? What's going on?

20:05.054 --> 20:06.989
Oh, hey. Hi. Sorry I'm late.

20:06.989 --> 20:08.825
Got caught up with Harry.

20:11.160 --> 20:14.163
You... caught up with Harry?

20:14.163 --> 20:14.981
About?

20:14.982 --> 20:16.560
Oh no, I haven't told him anything yet.

20:16.561 --> 20:17.561
How is this omelet?

20:17.500 --> 20:19.469
Honey, don't you think it's time?

20:19.469 --> 20:21.504
- Mmm.
- I know it's a difficult conversation,

20:21.504 --> 20:24.207
but it's not like you can
hide this from him forever.

20:24.207 --> 20:26.909
Oh, I know. He brought
home a pregnancy test today.

20:26.909 --> 20:28.311
- What?
- What?

20:28.311 --> 20:29.512
(Mouth full) Yeah, apparently,

20:29.512 --> 20:31.047
my breath smells like
some kind of metal baby.

20:31.047 --> 20:32.315
Whatever. You know what? I can't...

20:32.315 --> 20:34.250
I can't talk about it. Okay? I just can't.

20:34.250 --> 20:35.485
Savi...

20:35.485 --> 20:36.986
Please. Please.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.821
Let's not talk about it. Okay?

20:38.821 --> 20:40.056
Sure.

20:40.056 --> 20:42.124
Okay. I mean, for this one meal,

20:42.124 --> 20:45.261
I am officially not pregnant.

20:45.261 --> 20:48.798
I have to pee, for the 19th time today.

21:01.244 --> 21:03.012
Huh.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.747
The farmer John look really works on you.

21:04.747 --> 21:06.349
I wouldn't have thought.

21:06.349 --> 21:10.052
Oh. Ugh. The odor, however...
not so much. (Sniffles)

21:10.052 --> 21:13.022
This is an abnormally large cucumber.

21:15.258 --> 21:17.326
Okay. What?

21:17.326 --> 21:19.395
What did I do now?

21:19.395 --> 21:21.097
Saw you in here raiding the fridge

21:21.097 --> 21:24.033
with your, uh, "friend" yesterday.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.769
Oh, crap. We ate all your
kiwi. That's why you're mad.

21:26.769 --> 21:28.271
I'm not mad.

21:28.271 --> 21:30.039
Well, you seem mad.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.341
No, I just... I don't get you sometimes.

21:32.341 --> 21:33.910
What?

21:33.910 --> 21:36.078
Well, you made such a big
deal about making a new friend,

21:36.078 --> 21:38.514
- and how important it was to you.
- It is important to me.

21:38.514 --> 21:39.849
Then why are you mucking it up?

21:39.849 --> 21:41.150
I'm not mucking anything up.

21:41.150 --> 21:44.253
Well, you had sex with her, right?

21:44.253 --> 21:46.222
So? What do you care?

21:46.222 --> 21:48.057
I don't care. You should, though,

21:48.057 --> 21:50.026
if the friendship truly matters to you.

21:50.026 --> 21:52.094
Harry, I appreciate your concern,

21:52.094 --> 21:54.196
but Alex an I talked
about it, and we're good.

21:54.196 --> 21:57.133
Well, you might think
you're good, but come on.

21:57.133 --> 21:59.168
Haven't you seen all those terrible movies

21:59.168 --> 22:01.437
where you learn that friends
can't have sex with each other?

22:01.437 --> 22:04.006
Yeah, but the lesson I learned is

22:04.006 --> 22:05.808
not to be the boring straight person

22:05.808 --> 22:08.177
whose conventional values
never bring them any happiness.

22:08.177 --> 22:12.181
Joss, sometimes having values
is what brings you happiness.

22:12.181 --> 22:14.116
You know what? Screw you, Harry.

22:14.116 --> 22:16.152
I have values. Just because
they're not the same as yours

22:16.152 --> 22:17.787
doesn't mean you get to judge me.

22:17.787 --> 22:19.221
You're being awfully defensive

22:19.221 --> 22:20.823
for someone who doesn't
think she did anything wrong.

22:22.224 --> 22:25.928
Get over yourself.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.101
So...

22:32.101 --> 22:34.170
you wanna talk about
what happened yesterday?

22:34.170 --> 22:36.305
Yesterday? What are you talking about?

22:36.305 --> 22:38.407
- With Jerica.
- Who is Jerica?

22:38.407 --> 22:41.510
The paralegal that you basically
hazed like some sorority girl.

22:41.510 --> 22:43.145
It was hardly hazing.

22:43.145 --> 22:45.114
Just asking her to do her job.

22:45.114 --> 22:48.184
Very sorry if it took away from
your precious time together. (Laughs)

22:48.184 --> 22:50.119
So I was right.

22:50.119 --> 22:52.021
You... you... you do
have a problem with her.

22:52.111 --> 22:55.448
No. I have a problem with
flighty girls in flimsy blouses

22:55.448 --> 22:56.949
not doing their work

22:56.949 --> 22:59.118
and preventing me from doing mine.

22:59.118 --> 23:01.220
In other words, you're jealous.

23:01.220 --> 23:03.389
(Chuckles) I'm not jealous.

23:03.389 --> 23:05.057
If you want to sleep with her,

23:05.057 --> 23:06.525
please, by all means, do it.

23:06.525 --> 23:08.194
I don't care.

23:08.194 --> 23:09.528
Like hell, you don't.

23:09.528 --> 23:10.896
Excuse me?

23:10.896 --> 23:13.499
You obviously do care.

23:13.499 --> 23:16.068
Okay.

23:16.068 --> 23:18.504
You know what? I, uh, you're right.

23:18.504 --> 23:19.505
Okay.

23:19.505 --> 23:20.873
I am jealous,

23:20.873 --> 23:22.908
but of you.

23:22.908 --> 23:24.176
Of me?

23:24.176 --> 23:26.412
Because you get to do whatever you want,

23:26.412 --> 23:28.447
and it just doesn't matter.

23:28.447 --> 23:31.117
My life has been rocked to the core

23:31.117 --> 23:33.452
by this thing that we did,

23:33.452 --> 23:37.189
okay, and you get to walk
around completely unscathed.

23:37.189 --> 23:38.891
(Scoffs) Do you honestly think

23:38.891 --> 23:40.826
that I've... I've come
out of this unscathed?

23:40.826 --> 23:43.429
Uh... are... are you blind, Savannah?

23:43.429 --> 23:46.098
Why do you think I'm
even here talking to you?

23:46.098 --> 23:48.200
W... why do you think I come
back every time you turn me away?

23:48.300 --> 23:51.303
I do it because you affected me.

23:51.303 --> 23:53.339
There is something between us.

23:53.339 --> 23:55.541
Whether you choose to
admit it or not, it's th...

23:55.541 --> 23:57.076
It's, you know, it's... it's... it's there,

23:57.076 --> 23:59.044
and if you'd just talk to me

23:59.044 --> 24:01.313
instead of lecturing me on how
it's never gonna happen again,

24:01.313 --> 24:04.917
I would've told you exactly how I felt.

24:04.917 --> 24:08.917
I would've told you that I don't
regret what happened that night.

24:10.256 --> 24:13.292
Not for a moment.

24:13.292 --> 24:15.060
Not for a second.

24:36.843 --> 24:39.312
Okay. Let's get this show on the road.

24:39.312 --> 24:40.914
Truck's almost full.

24:40.914 --> 24:43.717
I can't decide if I should
take this vase or not.

24:43.717 --> 24:45.385
Well, is it yours?

24:45.385 --> 24:46.886
Well, we bought it together
on a trip to Palm Springs,

24:46.886 --> 24:48.555
but she didn't like it,

24:48.555 --> 24:49.889
but she paid for it.

24:49.889 --> 24:52.359
Well, if you love it, you should take it.

24:52.359 --> 24:53.526
Yeah? Maybe.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.428
I don't know. I have to be honest,

24:55.428 --> 24:56.963
I'm a little out of my element here.

24:56.963 --> 24:59.766
This is... (Exhales) super intense.

24:59.766 --> 25:02.002
I know. I shouldn't have
dragged you into all this.

25:02.002 --> 25:04.904
No. I didn't want you to do it alone.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.274
Okay.

25:07.274 --> 25:08.642
Executive decision.

25:08.642 --> 25:10.377
Leave the vase.

25:10.377 --> 25:11.745
Yeah, you're right.

25:11.745 --> 25:12.846
Yeah.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.481
Hey.

25:15.849 --> 25:18.551
I thought you were gonna be at work today.

25:18.551 --> 25:21.821
I left early. I have a cold.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.423
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need anything?

25:23.423 --> 25:26.626
I can get you some orange
juice from the fridge.

25:26.626 --> 25:30.363
Uh, no, thank you. I really...
I just wanna lie down.

25:31.398 --> 25:32.832
Are you guys almost done?

25:32.832 --> 25:36.269
Yeah, there's a couple
things left in the bathroom.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.309
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

25:42.309 --> 25:44.344
I'll wait outside.

25:44.344 --> 25:47.347
What are you even doing here?

25:47.347 --> 25:49.249
Oh. I'm helping Alex move.

25:49.249 --> 25:51.751
(Scoffs) I am such an idiot.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.687
And here we go.

25:53.687 --> 25:55.288
You know, I kept thinking

25:55.288 --> 25:57.324
I must've missed a sign or something.

25:57.324 --> 25:59.259
We were in such a good place,

25:59.259 --> 26:01.795
looking for houses, talking
about getting pregnant,

26:01.795 --> 26:05.031
and all of a sudden, there was this shift.

26:05.031 --> 26:07.667
Just tell Alex I'm in the car, okay?

26:07.667 --> 26:09.269
Suddenly, Alex is having

26:09.269 --> 26:12.539
all these problems with the relationship,

26:12.539 --> 26:13.840
and I actually believed her.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.276
She was having problems, Sally.

26:16.276 --> 26:17.711
Yeah.

26:17.711 --> 26:19.579
You.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.281
You were the problem.

26:21.281 --> 26:22.282
Don't try to blame this on me.

26:22.282 --> 26:23.616
I'm not.

26:23.616 --> 26:27.354
I mean, it's not your
fault Alex fell for you.

26:27.354 --> 26:28.655
(Scoffs)

26:28.599 --> 26:29.900
At least I don't think it's
your fault. Maybe it is.

26:29.900 --> 26:30.934
Maybe you seduced her.

26:30.934 --> 26:32.303
She didn't fall for me.

26:32.303 --> 26:33.904
Sally, Alex and I are just friends.

26:33.904 --> 26:36.640
If you believe that, then
you're dumber than you look.

26:39.877 --> 26:41.779
Okay, that's everything.

26:42.780 --> 26:44.648
Don't forget to leave the key.

27:04.124 --> 27:05.041
Hey.

27:05.041 --> 27:07.844
Come on. Let's go.

27:19.499 --> 27:21.134
You can not talk to me all you want.

27:21.134 --> 27:24.837
You're still grounded.
You finish your homework?

27:24.837 --> 27:25.972
Yes.

27:25.972 --> 27:27.206
Good. I'd like to see it when we get home.

27:27.206 --> 27:28.408
Fine.

27:30.543 --> 27:33.046
What you did was really wrong, Lucy.

27:33.046 --> 27:35.982
Lying like that? Not being
where you're supposed to be?

27:35.982 --> 27:37.984
Rules are there for a reason.

27:37.984 --> 27:39.252
I know that. Okay?

27:39.252 --> 27:41.521
Being honorable and responsible

27:41.521 --> 27:44.090
are two of the most important
things a person can be.

27:44.090 --> 27:45.825
I wanted to meet Selena!

27:45.825 --> 27:48.194
And I want to meet the Pope
so I can punch him in the face,

27:48.194 --> 27:50.096
but you don't see me flying off to Rome

27:50.096 --> 27:53.099
because I have a commitment
to you and to the shop.

27:53.099 --> 27:54.901
We can't just do whatever we want to do

27:54.901 --> 27:56.135
because we want to do it.

27:55.945 --> 27:57.313
Well, I'm not sorry I went.

27:57.313 --> 27:59.916
It was the best moment of my life.

27:59.916 --> 28:01.985
She gave me a hug and
she wrote inside my book.

28:01.985 --> 28:05.188
She said "Love, Selena."

28:05.188 --> 28:07.791
Lucy, if this meant so much to you,

28:07.791 --> 28:10.026
why didn't you just ask me to take you?

28:10.026 --> 28:12.695
You normally ask my permission
to do things like this.

28:12.695 --> 28:15.365
Well, usually, you're not acting so weird.

28:17.133 --> 28:18.802
You think I'm acting weird?

28:18.802 --> 28:20.036
It doesn't matter.

28:20.036 --> 28:21.604
You would never have
let me cut school anyway.

28:21.604 --> 28:22.605
You don't know that.

28:22.605 --> 28:24.073
Yeah, I do.

28:24.073 --> 28:26.242
No offense, mom, but you're
kind of a goody two-shoes.

28:31.281 --> 28:32.749
Elizabeth Grey is here.

28:32.749 --> 28:34.317
Oh, good. Send her in.

28:36.219 --> 28:38.588
I'm so glad to see you.

28:38.588 --> 28:40.690
When you didn't return my phone calls, I...

28:40.690 --> 28:42.592
I'm sorry about that.

28:42.592 --> 28:45.228
I needed time to figure
out what to do next,

28:45.228 --> 28:48.264
and now that I have, I need your help.

28:48.264 --> 28:50.266
What kind of help?

28:50.266 --> 28:53.670
I've decided I don't want
the insurance money anymore.

28:53.670 --> 28:55.171
What?

28:55.171 --> 28:57.841
This investigation has
gone on for too long.

28:57.841 --> 29:00.977
I can't take the pressure,
and I can't risk Sam

29:00.977 --> 29:03.246
finding out what I did
if this all goes to trial.

29:03.246 --> 29:05.849
Trial? Hold on, Elizabeth.

29:05.849 --> 29:07.050
Even with the new testimony,

29:07.050 --> 29:08.885
it's highly unlikely they would be able

29:08.885 --> 29:11.621
to follow through with
a criminal investigation.

29:11.621 --> 29:13.790
I'm sure if we wait it out a bit longer...

29:13.790 --> 29:15.291
I've been waiting.

29:15.115 --> 29:16.717
It hasn't gone away.

29:16.717 --> 29:19.053
And now it's possible I could
even go to jail over this.

29:19.053 --> 29:20.821
You're not going to jail.

29:20.821 --> 29:22.022
I want you to tell them

29:22.022 --> 29:23.624
that Thomas was a man

29:23.624 --> 29:25.993
who needed to control every situation,

29:25.993 --> 29:27.961
even his own death,

29:27.961 --> 29:31.065
that he was suicidal.

29:31.065 --> 29:33.467
No, I can't do that.

29:35.903 --> 29:39.606
I appreciate you wanting
to protect my settlement.

29:39.606 --> 29:41.709
It's very kind of you.

29:41.709 --> 29:43.510
But now I'm asking that you submit

29:43.510 --> 29:45.612
the notes from your sessions

29:45.612 --> 29:48.716
so that I can put this behind me.

29:48.716 --> 29:51.518
But I don't have any notes that say that.

29:55.823 --> 29:57.024
You can make them up.

29:57.024 --> 29:58.992
And make them irrefutable, Karen,

29:58.992 --> 30:01.595
so the insurance company
can deny the claim,

30:01.595 --> 30:04.064
and we can both move on with our lives.

30:04.064 --> 30:06.133
You don't understand.

30:06.133 --> 30:08.168
I don't remember any specifics.

30:08.168 --> 30:11.772
January 28th.

30:11.772 --> 30:14.675
A day I'll never forget
for the rest of my life.

30:14.675 --> 30:16.944
Thomas came home from the doctor.

30:16.944 --> 30:18.679
There were tears in his eyes.

30:18.679 --> 30:21.148
I knew something was terribly wrong.

30:21.148 --> 30:23.751
That afternoon, he went
to his usual appointment

30:23.751 --> 30:25.919
at your office.

30:25.919 --> 30:27.788
You can start there.

30:27.788 --> 30:31.959
Fabricating notes could
cost me my medical license.

30:31.959 --> 30:35.496
Besides, I already told the investigator

30:35.496 --> 30:38.599
that Thomas wasn't suicidal.

30:38.599 --> 30:40.701
Writing notes that now say the opposite

30:40.701 --> 30:42.636
would arouse even more suspicion.

30:42.636 --> 30:44.805
Karen...

30:46.840 --> 30:49.176
you need to do this for both of us.

30:50.730 --> 30:52.102
No matter how you look at it,

30:53.107 --> 30:54.598
we're in this together.

30:58.118 --> 31:01.622
(Crickets chirping)

31:01.622 --> 31:05.793
(Humming)

31:05.793 --> 31:07.861
(Whistles)

31:07.861 --> 31:10.130
Virgin cranberry mojito

31:10.130 --> 31:14.034
with mint and agave nectar.

31:14.034 --> 31:15.569
I just peed.

31:15.569 --> 31:17.638
There's also a hint of anise.

31:17.638 --> 31:20.507
It's a, uh, it's a natural diuretic.

31:20.507 --> 31:22.075
I'm not thirsty.

31:22.075 --> 31:23.710
Well, just drink enough

31:23.710 --> 31:26.046
so you can pee on the
stick for ten seconds.

31:28.081 --> 31:29.683
What is this? A vase?

31:29.683 --> 31:31.785
(Chuckles) Come on.

31:39.693 --> 31:41.895
Okay.

31:41.895 --> 31:43.163
Yeah.

31:51.750 --> 31:54.519
Um, I think your sister's mad at me.

31:54.519 --> 31:57.055
I, uh, kind of picked a
fight with her this afternoon.

31:57.055 --> 31:59.892
You really want to talk
about my sister right now?

31:59.892 --> 32:03.829
I'm just trying to keep things casual.

32:03.829 --> 32:05.797
Sorry. Take your time.

32:24.049 --> 32:25.951
Well, that was quick.

32:25.951 --> 32:27.486
Did you set a timer?

32:28.787 --> 32:30.055
I'm bleeding.

32:30.055 --> 32:31.456
Y...

32:33.926 --> 32:35.127
you got your period.

32:40.832 --> 32:43.635
Well, I guess you're not pregnant then.

32:45.604 --> 32:47.506
Yeah, I guess not.

32:58.281 --> 33:00.670
(Mouth full) Toasted sesame from the nosh.

33:00.670 --> 33:01.753
I can make you one real fast.

33:01.753 --> 33:05.691
No, but thanks. I've got a pile
of paperwork to catch up on.

33:06.925 --> 33:09.695
Hey, your friend dropped by this morning.

33:09.695 --> 33:11.329
Mr. Newsome?

33:11.329 --> 33:14.266
Said he was an investigator
for the Thomas Grey case.

33:14.266 --> 33:15.734
He came to see me again?

33:15.734 --> 33:17.903
Well, actually, he came to see me.

33:17.903 --> 33:19.738
Why? What did he want?

33:19.738 --> 33:21.473
I couldn't really tell exactly.

33:21.473 --> 33:24.409
He kept asking all these general
questions about the practice,

33:24.409 --> 33:27.212
our policy with patients'
records... that sort of thing.

33:27.212 --> 33:29.247
I'm so sorry he bothered you.

33:29.247 --> 33:31.683
I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.

33:31.683 --> 33:33.418
You in trouble, Karen?

33:33.418 --> 33:34.886
What?

33:34.886 --> 33:37.456
It's just... you seem
so stressed out lately.

33:37.456 --> 33:38.890
I'm worried about you.

33:38.890 --> 33:40.726
Do you need to talk about anything?

33:40.726 --> 33:43.929
I'm fine. I've just had
a lot on my mind lately.

33:43.929 --> 33:45.263
Nervous about that panel?

33:45.263 --> 33:47.566
You know me. I hate public speaking.

33:47.566 --> 33:49.267
Yeah, well, just, uh,

33:49.267 --> 33:51.336
imagine everyone in the audience as naked.

33:52.804 --> 33:54.372
(Mouth full) Except for me.

33:54.372 --> 33:55.607
That would be weird.

34:04.916 --> 34:08.887
(Cell phone rings)

34:08.887 --> 34:10.956
(Ring)

34:10.956 --> 34:12.591
(Clears throat)

34:12.591 --> 34:14.226
(Ring)

34:14.226 --> 34:15.761
Hey, you. What's up?

34:15.761 --> 34:17.429
(Alex) Oh, gosh. I hate unpacking.

34:17.429 --> 34:19.563
Oh. How's the new place?

34:19.563 --> 34:20.799
It's small.

34:20.799 --> 34:23.802
- Realtors prefer the term "cozy."
- And quaint.

34:23.802 --> 34:26.371
- Charming. (Laughs)
- Charming. (Laughs)

34:26.371 --> 34:29.507
(Sighs) I actually could use a break.

34:29.507 --> 34:30.775
Do you wanna get lunch?

34:30.596 --> 34:32.164
There's this new vegan
place I've been dying

34:32.164 --> 34:34.333
to try, and it'll be my treat
since you helped me move.

34:34.333 --> 34:36.368
Oh, um, I wish I could,

34:36.368 --> 34:39.170
but I'm totally swamped
with work right now.

34:39.170 --> 34:40.806
- Bummer.
- In fact, I should hang up.

34:40.806 --> 34:43.108
The boss is totally
hovering. I'll call you, okay?

34:43.108 --> 34:43.775
Okay.

34:43.775 --> 34:45.010
I'll talk to you later.

34:45.010 --> 34:46.110
Bye.

34:53.619 --> 34:56.621
(Typing on keyboard) (Computer beeps)

34:58.790 --> 35:01.059
So, Savannah...

35:02.561 --> 35:04.529
you're still pregnant.

35:04.529 --> 35:07.399
That must be a relief to hear.

35:10.068 --> 35:11.336
(Crying) Yes. Oh.

35:11.336 --> 35:13.138
Yes, it is.

35:13.138 --> 35:15.474
You're okay.

35:15.474 --> 35:17.676
It's okay.

35:17.676 --> 35:21.246
I was so worried that I lost it.

35:21.246 --> 35:25.050
Spotting is perfectly normal at this stage.

35:25.050 --> 35:26.785
But we've got some
other problems to discuss

35:26.785 --> 35:29.388
if you want to have a healthy pregnancy.

35:29.388 --> 35:31.189
(Sniffles) What do you mean?

35:31.189 --> 35:33.759
Your blood pressure is
a real concern, Savi,

35:33.759 --> 35:36.361
so is your heart rate.
They're both off the charts.

35:36.361 --> 35:39.731
Do you have any idea what
could be causing this?

35:39.731 --> 35:43.731
Uh, I've been under a lot of stress lately

35:44.469 --> 35:46.772
at home and at work.

35:46.772 --> 35:49.708
Anything we should discuss?

35:49.708 --> 35:53.712
It's just all normal stuff.

35:53.712 --> 35:55.747
Well, it's a problem.

35:55.747 --> 35:57.783
Things can't continue the way they are.

35:57.783 --> 36:00.719
You've got to make some lifestyle changes

36:00.719 --> 36:03.088
for you and your baby.

36:10.696 --> 36:13.532
Good night.

36:15.534 --> 36:16.635
Ooh.

36:16.635 --> 36:18.203
Hey.

36:18.203 --> 36:19.738
Oh. Hey.

36:19.798 --> 36:23.335
Um, come on in. I'm just finishing up.

36:23.335 --> 36:25.303
I was in the neighborhood.
Wanted to check in.

36:25.303 --> 36:27.072
See how you came out in the sentencing

36:27.072 --> 36:30.575
for your little criminal. Two
weeks in the hole, no playdates...

36:30.575 --> 36:32.344
- No TV.
- No computer.

36:32.344 --> 36:33.678
No computer?

36:33.678 --> 36:36.314
That's where they tend
to watch all their TV.

36:36.314 --> 36:38.784
(Chuckles) She played me so well.

36:38.784 --> 36:40.852
Do they have a report due on Facebook

36:40.852 --> 36:42.687
in their graphic arts class?

36:42.687 --> 36:44.723
They don't have graphic arts class.

36:44.723 --> 36:45.857
(Laughs)

36:45.857 --> 36:49.561
I am the worst father. Oh.

36:51.269 --> 36:52.604
You all right?

36:52.604 --> 36:54.439
Are you kidding? I'm perfect.

36:54.439 --> 36:57.642
I'm a perfectly polite,
good, sensible woman

36:57.642 --> 36:59.277
who does the right thing...

36:59.277 --> 37:02.280
always have my whole life...
and what did it get me?

37:03.982 --> 37:05.317
My spidey sense tells me

37:05.317 --> 37:07.819
that you're not happy with the answer.

37:07.819 --> 37:11.489
It got me a husband who
ran off and cheated and died

37:11.489 --> 37:13.625
and a mistress who wants
me to pay for their child,

37:13.625 --> 37:16.428
and because I'm me, I'm actually doing it.

37:16.428 --> 37:18.897
April, that... that's what's been going on?

37:18.897 --> 37:20.999
I married my high school boyfriend,

37:20.999 --> 37:22.667
never strayed in 20 years,

37:22.667 --> 37:25.270
made a perfect home, raised
a nearly perfect child.

37:25.270 --> 37:27.339
The only imperfect thing about her is

37:27.339 --> 37:30.408
this rebellious streak that's
just starting to rear its head.

37:30.408 --> 37:31.977
- And you know what?
- What?

37:31.977 --> 37:33.878
I'm proud of her

37:33.878 --> 37:36.414
and even a little jealous.

37:36.614 --> 37:40.614
I've never done an impulsive
or reckless thing in my life.

37:41.953 --> 37:43.655
There's still time.

37:48.860 --> 37:52.530
You didn't just happen to be
in the neighborhood, did you?

38:08.146 --> 38:09.747
Mm.
