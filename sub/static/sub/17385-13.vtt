Not many people would notice it.

07:31.295 --> 07:32.628
Never could understand

07:32.731 --> 07:36.131
if a belt buckle was jewelry or clothing,

07:36.234 --> 07:37.433
'cause a belt is useful.

07:37.535 --> 07:39.001
Belt buckle is kinda bling,

07:39.103 --> 07:40.302

07:40.405 --> 07:42.170

07:42.272 --> 07:44.038
when you were a kid in the '70s

07:49.480 --> 07:52.180
it said that your parents
just loved you that much more.

07:52.282 --> 07:54.315
'Cause it's not like belts
didn't come with buckles,

07:54.418 --> 07:55.950

"What's wrong with the one

buckle? Well, here it is.

08:27.015 --> 08:28.581
they would get what they wanted and leave.

08:28.683 --> 08:30.683
The amount of stuff left behind-

08:30.786 --> 08:33.183
like, this lady who had
amassed a huge collection

08:33.287 --> 08:36.655
of these little, like,
tiny but ornate teacups.

08:36.756 --> 08:37.688
We're like-

08:39.427 --> 08:40.926
Throwin' 'em into the dumpster.

08:41.028 --> 08:42.660
Everything right in the garbage.

08:42.763 --> 08:44.730
That's heartbreaking.
That's like this one.

08:44.832 --> 08:46.565
You had to mail away to get it, right?

08:46.667 --> 08:47.866
It's a Kellogg's mail away.

08:47.968 --> 08:49.901
Can you imagine
this six-year-old

08:50.002 --> 08:51.736
who begged his mom for the quarter

08:51.838 --> 08:54.204
to cut this out, send
it, and then get it back?

08:54.307 --> 08:55.406
And it's made it to me.

08:55.508 --> 08:56.841
I could imagine him dying

08:56.943 --> 08:58.075
and me throwing his stuff in a dumpster.

08:58.177 --> 08:59.444
Oh, my God.

08:59.546 --> 09:01.178
You want to talk about life perspective?

09:01.280 --> 09:02.513
There were photo albums,

09:02.615 --> 09:04.582
and you'd flip the photo on the back.

09:04.684 --> 09:07.083
It would have the kind of
summation of what was going on.

09:07.185 --> 09:09.052
Remember? Like, "A good
time was had by all. "

09:09.154 --> 09:10.053
Boom.

09:11.389 --> 09:13.122
Oh, that haunts me to this day.

09:13.224 --> 09:14.524
Why are you sellin' 'em?

09:14.626 --> 09:16.025
As much as I like Superman,

09:16.127 --> 09:17.694
I would really love to take the money

09:17.796 --> 09:20.363
and invest it in "Batman Adventures" 12.

09:20.466 --> 09:21.465
Ooh, first Harley, huh?

09:21.567 --> 09:22.632
Yeah.

09:22.734 --> 09:23.866
What do you want for 'em?

09:23.968 --> 09:26.802
Well, I would really like to get,

09:26.904 --> 09:29.438
for everything, about $175.

09:29.540 --> 09:31.106
Wow.

09:31.208 --> 09:33.609
I didn't think you were
gonna come in that high.

09:33.711 --> 09:34.777
Shoulda saved those teacups.

09:34.879 --> 09:36.111
Maybe we coulda did a little trade.

09:36.213 --> 09:37.546
Yeah, you into teacups?

09:37.648 --> 09:39.281
I love teacups.

09:39.383 --> 09:40.615
Oh, too late.

09:40.717 --> 09:42.450
How about $100?

09:42.552 --> 09:43.751
$150?

09:43.854 --> 09:47.321
Aww, no.

09:47.423 --> 09:48.590
How about $110?

09:48.692 --> 09:50.391
Meet me at $125.

09:50.494 --> 09:52.226
<i>♪ ♪</i>

09:52.328 --> 09:54.095
- All right, $125.
- Awesome.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.565
All right. $125.

09:58.667 --> 09:59.967
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

10:00.068 --> 10:01.167
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you. See you later.

10:01.269 --> 10:02.569
- Have a good one.
- All right.

10:02.671 --> 10:04.137
Sal Buscema.
- One of the greats.

10:04.239 --> 10:05.271
There are too many Jokers on here.

10:05.374 --> 10:06.473
That may be the record

10:06.575 --> 10:08.475
for the most Jokers on a page of art.

10:08.577 --> 10:10.644
Can I see that copy of
"Amazing Adventures" number 18?

10:10.746 --> 10:12.012
Absolutely. First Killraven.

10:12.114 --> 10:14.722
One of the most underrated
series of all time.

10:15.540 --> 10:18.104
Pick two robots,
and they gotta fight, man.

10:18.139 --> 10:18.975
Here's mine.

10:19.010 --> 10:23.085
Brainiac versus HAL from "2001."

10:23.120 --> 10:24.384
It's not very physical,
that battle.

10:24.419 --> 10:26.022
Not at all.
It's a chess game.

10:26.057 --> 10:28.269
More of a chess game approach.

10:28.304 --> 10:30.482
I might go a little bit
of midget wrestling.

10:30.517 --> 10:33.459
I'm gonna go with R2-D2
and Tom Servo

10:33.494 --> 10:35.915
<i>from "Mystery Science Theater. "</i>
<i>- </i>

10:35.950 --> 10:38.336
Bet those got a little of a
sarcastic, uh, twist to them.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.291
But Servo's got the edge,
'cause we understand him.

10:40.326 --> 10:41.989
The other guy's all,
"Boop, boop, boo. "

10:43.214 --> 10:45.146
Ming? Robot fight. Go.

10:45.248 --> 10:46.413
I'll go with BB-8

10:46.515 --> 10:48.549
<i>versus K9 from "Doctor Who. "</i>

10:48.651 --> 10:50.484
I'll watch that fight.
What do you got, Zap?

10:50.586 --> 10:52.620
I got Iron Giant versus... all: Ooh.

10:52.722 --> 10:55.255
The Megazord from "Power Rangers. "

10:55.357 --> 10:56.589
Whoa.

10:56.691 --> 10:58.491
- Yeah.
- Heart versus tech.

10:58.593 --> 11:00.994
How do you know the name
of the "Power Rangers" robots?

11:02.697 --> 11:03.930
What about you, Bry?

11:04.032 --> 11:05.331
Technically, I know he's a droid,

11:05.433 --> 11:06.933
but I'd go C-3PO

11:07.035 --> 11:08.668
<i>versus that silver C-3PO
guy... </i> <i>- </i>

11:08.771 --> 11:10.003
<i>In the first "Star Wars"</i>
<i>who was rude to him. </i>

11:10.105 --> 11:11.570
The one that walks by real quick?

11:11.672 --> 11:12.772
Yeah, and he's like, "How rude. "

11:12.874 --> 11:14.073
Yeah.

11:14.175 --> 11:15.407
Finally, he gets to take him on.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.675
He's like, "I said you were rude. "

11:16.778 --> 11:18.343
Yes, that... that smallest slight

11:18.445 --> 11:19.945
now erupts into a battle.

11:31.815 --> 11:33.814
Let's say we were a super team.

11:33.917 --> 11:34.882
What would our name be?

11:34.984 --> 11:36.250
It's gotta sound badass,

11:36.352 --> 11:37.518
but we're a bunch of good guys, right?

11:37.620 --> 11:39.086
So we're...
- Yeah, of course.

11:39.188 --> 11:40.721
Okay. All right, all
right. Just making sure.

11:40.823 --> 11:41.822
So I'm going with something like,

11:41.925 --> 11:43.090
The Nightmare Squadron.

11:43.192 --> 11:44.358
That rolls right off the tongue.

11:44.460 --> 11:45.826
It does roll... what?

11:45.929 --> 11:47.494
Why do you want to
be known as a nightmare?

11:47.596 --> 11:48.930
A nightmare to evil.

11:49.032 --> 11:50.096
They're so scared that they don't want

11:50.198 --> 11:51.497
to commit crimes anymore.

11:51.599 --> 11:54.034
- Okay, Nightmare Squadron.
- Yeah.

11:54.136 --> 11:55.501
You got somethin' better?

11:55.603 --> 11:56.502
Like The Purveyors?

11:56.604 --> 11:57.870
Purveyors of what?

11:57.973 --> 11:59.839
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Comics, dreams.

11:59.942 --> 12:01.174
Nightmares. I don't know.

12:01.276 --> 12:02.608
Mike's on the right trail, though.

12:02.710 --> 12:04.710
Let's say we need a super team name

12:04.813 --> 12:06.846
for at we do in real life.
- How about this?

12:06.948 --> 12:09.514
Super Bry and the Garden-Variety Nobodies.

12:11.718 --> 12:13.352
- Hey, how you doin'?
- How you doin', man?

12:13.454 --> 12:14.886
I got a piece of original art here.

12:14.989 --> 12:16.121
Think you may be interested.

12:16.223 --> 12:17.622
All right, what do you got?

12:17.724 --> 12:20.359
Sal Buscema from the
Underoos' mini comic book,

12:20.461 --> 12:21.560
"Too Many Jokers!"

12:21.662 --> 12:23.562
- Oh, wow.
- Wow, look at that.

12:30.403 --> 12:31.702
There are too many Jokers on here.

12:31.804 --> 12:33.771
There's, like, one, two, three, four, five,

12:33.873 --> 12:35.606
six... eight Jokers on the page.

12:35.708 --> 12:37.408
That may be the record for the most Jokers

12:37.510 --> 12:38.443
on a page of art.

12:38.544 --> 12:39.543
Very cool, isn't it?

12:39.645 --> 12:40.544
It's awesome.

12:40.646 --> 12:41.979
So where'd you get this?

12:42.081 --> 12:43.913
A friend of mine had a comic book store,

12:44.016 --> 12:45.648
and I used to go there every day,

12:45.750 --> 12:47.317
and a... a guy walked in with this,

12:47.419 --> 12:49.552
and my eyes went, "Bing!" You know?

12:49.654 --> 12:51.121
And I'm like, "Hey, you don't want it,

12:51.223 --> 12:52.222
I can take it. "

12:52.324 --> 12:53.590
And I had some issues he wanted,

12:53.692 --> 12:55.392
and I... we traded off for it.

12:55.494 --> 12:57.594
Nice. It... it's tiny, though, huh?

12:57.696 --> 12:59.728
Well, this was the, uh, mini comic book

12:59.830 --> 13:02.298
that came with the Underoos underwear.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.001
The packaging was literally about that big.

13:05.103 --> 13:06.302
Small package, Ming?

13:08.939 --> 13:09.972
All this Underoo talk

13:10.074 --> 13:12.008
takes you right back to that day

13:12.110 --> 13:14.510
when you were wearin' those
Wonder Woman Underoos, right?

13:16.079 --> 13:17.312
Whoa.

13:17.414 --> 13:18.779
No! Where's yours?

13:18.882 --> 13:19.981
I didn't mean to wear it on the outside.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.516
Come on!

13:21.618 --> 13:22.917
I'm trying to forget
that, thank you very much.

13:23.020 --> 13:24.119
You think you could
still slip into a pair?

13:24.221 --> 13:25.186
Maybe I could fit back into them.

13:25.288 --> 13:26.787
I mean, that was a few years ago.

13:26.890 --> 13:27.989
I've kind of gained some weight since then.

13:28.091 --> 13:29.357
Really? I mean, you still look...

13:29.459 --> 13:30.691
you still look very svelte.

13:30.793 --> 13:32.259
Can we just drop the Underoo thing?

13:32.361 --> 13:34.094
Can we drop that, please?

13:34.196 --> 13:35.762
I love everything about the Underoos.

13:35.864 --> 13:37.197
The square package,

13:37.299 --> 13:38.765
had the character on it and stuff.

13:38.867 --> 13:40.434
Made you wanna wear underwear.

13:40.536 --> 13:42.169
When I was a kid, I
wasn't into that too much.

13:42.271 --> 13:43.270
It chafed.

13:43.372 --> 13:44.838
But this stuff I would wear,

13:44.940 --> 13:46.273
'cause sometimes you could wear a shirt

13:46.375 --> 13:48.642
that made you look like
your favorite character.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.343
Batman had a bat symbol.

13:50.445 --> 13:52.611
Boba Fett looked like his chest plate.

13:52.713 --> 13:54.313
So it was like, Underoos was also

13:54.416 --> 13:56.115
an early form of cosplay.

13:56.217 --> 13:57.983
So you think if you were
wearin' Boba Fett Underoos,

13:58.086 --> 13:59.652
people would know you were cosplaying?

13:59.754 --> 14:01.220
Or what, just walkin'
around in your underwear?

14:01.322 --> 14:02.855
Yeah, they're
like, "Look at this.

14:02.957 --> 14:04.823
This emperor has no clothes. "

14:04.926 --> 14:06.358
"Boba Fett didn't have a muffin top. "

14:08.328 --> 14:10.562
- So Sal Buscema.
- One of the greats.

14:10.664 --> 14:12.264
I mean, really one of those guys

14:12.366 --> 14:13.731
that drew our childhood, basically.

14:13.833 --> 14:14.732
Right, Mike?
- Essentially, yeah.

14:14.834 --> 14:15.733
He was doin', like,

14:15.835 --> 14:17.369
two or three books a month.

14:17.471 --> 14:19.037
So why you sellin'
this piece of artwork?

14:19.139 --> 14:21.806
Well, I'm getting into Mego dolls again,

14:21.908 --> 14:24.075
and a guy I know, uh, has a few of 'em

14:24.177 --> 14:25.876
that I wanna attain.
- Oh, yeah?

14:25.978 --> 14:27.311
And I want to sell to you

14:27.413 --> 14:28.479
so I can get them.

14:28.581 --> 14:30.047
Do we know who inked this?

14:30.149 --> 14:32.015
Not safe to assume that
he inked this as well?

14:32.118 --> 14:33.016
He's a pretty good inker.

14:33.119 --> 14:34.017
It... it very well may be

14:34.120 --> 14:35.018
inked by Sal as well.

14:35.121 --> 14:36.187
We're just not sure.

14:36.289 --> 14:37.188
- I can show you.
- Really?

14:37.290 --> 14:38.322
All right.

14:38.424 --> 14:39.557
Hey, look. "Sal Buscema.

14:39.658 --> 14:40.656
Pencils & Inks. "
- "Pencils & Inks. "

14:40.758 --> 14:41.657
- And inks, nice.
- Wow.

14:41.759 --> 14:43.159
Nice, Ming.

14:43.261 --> 14:45.328
After wowing me with
knowing that it was Sal inks,

14:45.430 --> 14:47.029
I'm gonna ask you what you think finally.

14:47.132 --> 14:49.399
Do you think this is somethin'
that we should acquire, Ming?

14:49.501 --> 14:51.734
It's a one-of-a-kind
Sal Buscema

14:51.836 --> 14:52.835
penciled and inked page.

14:52.937 --> 14:54.170
Yes, absolutely.
- All right.

14:54.272 --> 14:55.371
What do you want for it?

14:55.474 --> 14:57.239
I'm lookin' for $750.

14:57.341 --> 14:58.773
I want to get Ming's input on this.

14:58.875 --> 15:00.342
All right, for something that's not

15:00.444 --> 15:02.177
from a mainstream issue
that everyone has read

15:02.279 --> 15:04.012
and, you know, maybe
wants to own a piece of...

15:04.115 --> 15:05.347
$750 is very high.

15:05.449 --> 15:06.748
But I think the value is really

15:06.850 --> 15:08.317
in the multitude of the Jokers.

15:08.419 --> 15:09.618
I agree with that. That's cool.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.086
And you... and you have a Robin in here,

15:11.188 --> 15:13.455
which is also cool, but not Batman.

15:13.557 --> 15:15.089
- Very, very well done.
- Thank you.

15:15.191 --> 15:16.224
Why stop now?

15:16.326 --> 15:17.791
Throw out a counteroffer, my man.

15:17.893 --> 15:20.294
I would probably go
somewhere closer to $300.

15:20.396 --> 15:21.862
$300, okay.

15:21.964 --> 15:22.963
Where's the gun?

15:23.065 --> 15:24.532
And I'll turn my back around,

15:24.634 --> 15:26.434
because I feel like you're
robbing me right now.

15:26.536 --> 15:28.636
No, stop. Stop. Come on.

15:28.738 --> 15:30.438
I'll go $600 because I like you,

15:30.540 --> 15:31.771
and you're probably wearin'

15:31.873 --> 15:33.473
your Wonder Woman Underoos right now.

15:33.575 --> 15:34.974
That... you know that's
not in the bargain, right?

15:35.076 --> 15:36.743
Ming comes separately.

15:36.845 --> 15:38.911
How about $500, and he'll...

15:39.014 --> 15:40.280
and he'll send you some Polaroids

15:40.382 --> 15:41.748
of him in his Un... in his Underoos.

15:43.852 --> 15:45.118
- That's a deal.
- Oh!

15:45.220 --> 15:47.053
I'll take it. That's great.

15:47.156 --> 15:48.720
- All right.
- Wait, I didn't agree to this.

15:50.191 --> 15:51.290
I'll text you my number.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.426
- Thank you, man.
- Pleasure, thank you.

15:54.529 --> 15:55.927
- All right.
- Ming, thank you.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.062
- All right. Enjoy.
- I'll be expecting

15:57.165 --> 15:58.430
those pictures very soon.

15:58.533 --> 15:59.431
Yeah, I'll have those to you in a week.

15:59.534 --> 16:01.500
Gentlemen, take care.

16:01.602 --> 16:02.834
What happened to you, man?

16:02.936 --> 16:04.403
It's like all of a sudden a light switch

16:04.505 --> 16:05.470
has been turned on.

16:05.572 --> 16:06.671
It's like you get it.

16:06.773 --> 16:08.506
I'm... I'm back, baby.

16:08.608 --> 16:09.507
- Were you ever here?
- "Back"?

16:12.612 --> 16:13.744
What a concept, right?

16:13.846 --> 16:15.913
Killraven leads the human resistance

16:16.015 --> 16:16.914
against Martians.

16:17.016 --> 16:18.849
With leather thigh-high boots.

16:28.717 --> 16:30.717
If you guys could take one element

16:30.819 --> 16:32.185
from the Star Trek universe

16:32.288 --> 16:33.853
and inject it into the Star Wars universe,

16:33.955 --> 16:35.188
which would it be?

16:35.291 --> 16:36.556
I'd want to take the Federation

16:36.659 --> 16:38.292
and put it in the Star Wars universe,

16:38.394 --> 16:40.360
'cause you've got the
Empire versus the Federation?

16:40.462 --> 16:41.961
I think it'd be a pretty cool match.

16:42.063 --> 16:43.630
I... I... I like the way that sounds.

16:43.732 --> 16:45.564
That sounds like a lot of Senate meetings.

16:45.667 --> 16:48.167
A lot of, uh...

16:48.269 --> 16:50.670
a lot of Federation and
Senate hearings on that.

16:52.507 --> 16:54.173
What do you got for...
what's... what are you injecting

16:54.275 --> 16:55.374
from the Star Wars universe

16:55.476 --> 16:56.509
into the Star Trek universe?

16:56.611 --> 16:58.143
Uh, from Star Wars universe,

16:58.245 --> 16:59.679
I would like to see lightsabers

16:59.781 --> 17:00.846
in the Star Trek universe.

17:00.948 --> 17:02.647
I think just those phasers are lame.

17:02.749 --> 17:05.383
I would love Kirk trying to
defend against a lightsaber.

17:05.484 --> 17:06.851
Like, whoa, stop swinging

17:06.953 --> 17:08.386
that lightsaber at me.

17:08.488 --> 17:09.854
Oh, that's good.

17:11.758 --> 17:12.656
What do you got, Bry?

17:12.759 --> 17:13.991
I would take the entirety

17:14.093 --> 17:15.593
of the Star Wars universe

17:15.695 --> 17:17.395
and move it into the Star Trek universe.

17:17.497 --> 17:18.863
And Star Trek sucks.

17:21.098 --> 17:28.605
<i>♪ ♪</i>

17:28.708 --> 17:30.441
- How you doin'?
- Good. How are ya?

17:30.543 --> 17:32.976
Good. Can I see that copy of
"Amazing Adventures" number 18

17:33.078 --> 17:34.411
ya got over there?
- Absolutely.

17:34.513 --> 17:35.746
Hey, Mike?
- Yeah?

17:35.848 --> 17:37.780
Can you grab that
"Amazing Adventures" 18?

17:37.882 --> 17:39.081
- Sure.
- First Killraven.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.149
One of my favorite books.

17:40.251 --> 17:41.917
I'm very impressed.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.354
One of the most underrated
series of all time.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.729
How big a fan are you of H.G.
Wells' "War of the Worlds"?

17:52.831 --> 17:54.128
- I loved it.
- Yeah.

17:54.231 --> 17:55.430
One of my favorites when I was young.

17:55.532 --> 17:58.066
Marvel got the idea to do a comic book

17:58.168 --> 18:00.402
based on the, uh, Martian invasion

18:00.504 --> 18:02.604
in "War of the Worlds," and
this time, they come back.

18:02.706 --> 18:05.907
They put humankind on
the brink of extinction,

18:06.009 --> 18:09.344
and Killraven leads the
last of the human resistance.

18:09.446 --> 18:10.978
He becomes the leader of, uh...

18:11.080 --> 18:12.613
of humans against Martians.

18:12.715 --> 18:14.415
I mean, what a concept, right?

18:14.517 --> 18:16.316
Didn't really have any
kind of special powers.

18:16.419 --> 18:19.353
I'd consider him kind of
a... a futuristic Daredevil.

18:19.455 --> 18:20.688
So he would fight in the arenas.

18:20.790 --> 18:22.256
The Martians would make humans fight,

18:22.358 --> 18:24.191
and his arena name became Killraven,

18:24.293 --> 18:25.259
'cause he was unbeatable.

18:25.361 --> 18:26.927
He had never known a world

18:27.029 --> 18:29.161
that wasn't, uh, ruled by Martians,

18:29.264 --> 18:31.964
and he longed to, uh, free mankind.

18:32.066 --> 18:34.534
Why do you think they
always go after Martians?

18:34.636 --> 18:36.536
It's always like, "The
Martians are out to get us. "

18:36.638 --> 18:38.705
Why not just Moon men in general?

18:38.807 --> 18:40.607
Well, I think the... the red planet,

18:40.709 --> 18:43.276
and it was the... you know,
named after the god of war.

18:43.378 --> 18:44.510
And little green men.

18:44.612 --> 18:46.845
I think that just captured America

18:46.947 --> 18:48.947
that was starving for
science fiction, you know?

18:49.049 --> 18:50.616
There was no Star Wars back when,

18:50.718 --> 18:52.150
you know, H.G. Wells
wrote "War of the Worlds,"

18:52.252 --> 18:53.852
so that's why it became, like,

18:53.954 --> 18:57.790
the greatest science fiction
novel of all time, probably.

18:57.892 --> 18:58.990
That's so eloquent.

18:59.092 --> 19:00.893
Just drop that Mic. Well done.

19:03.430 --> 19:05.195
So how'd you get into, uh, Killraven?

19:05.298 --> 19:07.197
The first time I saw the
book was at the newsstand.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.800
It was 1973,

19:08.902 --> 19:11.235
and the... the cover
immediately jumped out at me.

19:11.337 --> 19:13.571
I mean, everybody was
into Superman and Batman

19:13.673 --> 19:14.705
and Spider-Man at the time.

19:14.808 --> 19:16.140
This was something different.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.342
With leather thigh
high boots.

19:18.444 --> 19:20.977
That's a freaky-deaky costume, man.

19:21.079 --> 19:22.512
That is weird.
- Well, you had to think.

19:22.614 --> 19:24.080
They're like, "What would we be wearing

19:24.182 --> 19:26.082
"a hundred years from now?

19:26.184 --> 19:27.383
Probably thigh-high boots. "

19:27.486 --> 19:29.085
Why is it always less? Like...

19:30.255 --> 19:31.655
It was... end of the '60s,

19:31.757 --> 19:33.723
high boots were in fashion in the 1960s.

19:33.826 --> 19:35.058
- For women.
- Yeah, for girls.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.526
I mean, dude, it's up to here.

19:37.628 --> 19:39.695
I've seen prostitutes that
would look at those boots

19:39.797 --> 19:40.996
and be like, "Too slutty. "

19:43.133 --> 19:45.434
I think I love the C
list characters like Killraven

19:45.536 --> 19:46.836
because the creators were allowed

19:46.938 --> 19:48.236
to do anything they really wanted.

19:48.339 --> 19:50.172
Like, in a book like Spider-Man or Batman,

19:50.274 --> 19:52.274
you're kinda tied to, like, you know,

19:52.376 --> 19:53.608
Batman and Spider-Man,

19:53.710 --> 19:55.076
you have a certain, you know...

19:55.178 --> 19:57.712
You're stuck in a web on Spider-Man.

19:57.814 --> 19:59.581
But with Killraven, they're like, "Go nuts.

19:59.683 --> 20:00.582
Nobody cares. "

20:02.519 --> 20:04.519
Do you mind if I take a
look at the inside of the book?

20:04.621 --> 20:07.555
Absolutely. Hold on.

20:07.657 --> 20:09.123
Here you go.

20:09.225 --> 20:10.557
Wow.

20:10.659 --> 20:12.092
I haven't flipped through this

20:12.194 --> 20:13.894
in over 40 years.

20:13.996 --> 20:16.096
- Takes you right back, right?
- Absolutely.

20:16.198 --> 20:17.097
Take a whiff of that, man.

20:17.199 --> 20:18.098
You don't smell that

20:18.200 --> 20:20.934
in today's comics.

20:21.036 --> 20:22.402
Ooh, yeah.

20:22.505 --> 20:23.837
- So what do you think?
- Definitely.

20:23.939 --> 20:25.138
Definitely gotta have this book.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.706
What are ya askin' for it?

20:26.808 --> 20:29.108
Uh, $24.95.

20:29.210 --> 20:30.142
Sold.

20:30.244 --> 20:31.644
Oh, I like a man

20:31.746 --> 20:33.112
who doesn't want to negotiate.

20:34.549 --> 20:35.882
- Have a good day, guys.
- All right.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.216
- Take it easy.
- See you later.

20:37.318 --> 20:39.251
I think I know how Ben Kenobi felt

20:39.353 --> 20:41.821
when he was like, "Oh, I felt
that disturbance in the Force. "

20:41.923 --> 20:43.288
- Yeah.
- A non-negotiation?

20:43.391 --> 20:45.657
Somebody paying the sticker price?

20:47.227 --> 20:49.661
Oh, and just like them
crazy kids in Kandor,

20:49.763 --> 20:51.062
we're off to hit the bottle.

20:51.164 --> 20:52.764
For "Comic Book Men," I'm Kevin Smith.

20:52.866 --> 20:54.098
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.634
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:55.736 --> 20:58.136
Remember, do not become
addicted to water, kids.

20:58.238 --> 20:59.938
It will take a hold of you,

21:00.040 --> 21:02.439
and you will resent its absence.

21:02.542 --> 21:03.606
Good night.
