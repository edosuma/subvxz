WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:03.500
Dre: Football.

00:03.500 --> 00:05.750
It's been
a touchy subject lately,

00:05.750 --> 00:08.880
but I'm pretty sure
you all know who I'm with.

00:08.880 --> 00:11.170
Oh, I stand with you, Kaep.

00:11.170 --> 00:12.710
But this?

00:12.710 --> 00:15.290
It's gonna take a full seven
months for me to get there.

00:15.290 --> 00:16.960
Regardless of all that,

00:16.960 --> 00:20.380
growing up,
I loved playing football.

00:20.380 --> 00:23.170
It was always my dream
that one day,

00:23.170 --> 00:26.170
I would have a son who would
follow in my footsteps.

00:26.170 --> 00:30.170
And that dream came true when
Jack came home and said this.

00:30.170 --> 00:31.710
I made
the football team!

00:31.710 --> 00:32.790
Oh!
Wh--

00:32.790 --> 00:34.500
What?! You did?!

00:34.500 --> 00:35.620
Oh!

00:36.710 --> 00:38.040
Ohh!

00:38.040 --> 00:40.170
I finally have
a real son!

00:40.170 --> 00:42.920
I finally have
a real son!

00:42.920 --> 00:44.750
Wow!
That was unbelievable!

00:44.750 --> 00:46.000
Play that back.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.120
Yeah, we gotta
see that again.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.670
He sees his man,

00:48.670 --> 00:51.040
and look how fast
he stops feeding that baby.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.460
Boy, he does not
give a damn.

00:52.460 --> 00:53.710
No, sir.

00:53.710 --> 00:55.920
And can we just talk about
this guy's footwork?

00:55.920 --> 00:57.830
The way he accelerates
through the gap,

00:57.830 --> 01:00.040
blowing right past
whoever that other kid is.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.420
He does not
love him as much.
Mnh-mnh.

01:02.420 --> 01:03.250
And check this out.

01:03.250 --> 01:05.710
There's not one,
not two,

01:05.710 --> 01:08.080
but three points of contact
with his son.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.080
I'll tell you what, that kid's
gonna feel that tomorrow.

01:10.080 --> 01:11.830
And maybe for
the rest of his life.
Mm.

01:11.830 --> 01:13.830
Real son,
I'm gonna buy you a car.

01:20.420 --> 01:23.210
You're looking at
Valley Glen Prep Middle School's

01:23.210 --> 01:26.580
newest punt returner,
Jack "Tiny Dancer" Johnson.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.000
Dre: Oh,
we've got to celebrate!

01:28.000 --> 01:30.120
Finally got an athlete
in the family!

01:30.120 --> 01:31.620
Hey! I play soccer.
Yeah.

01:31.620 --> 01:34.420
And I was captain
of the field hockey team.

01:36.040 --> 01:37.500
Must you always
bring that up?

01:37.500 --> 01:40.170
Sweetheart,
I had no idea

01:40.170 --> 01:42.880
that you were interested
in football.

01:42.880 --> 01:45.120
I mean, I love sports
and I love dancing.
Yeah. Hmm.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.830
So a sport
with dancing?

01:46.830 --> 01:48.540
Sign me up!
Mm-hmm.

01:48.540 --> 01:50.210
Also, I got you guys
something.
Oh, let's see.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.380
Oh, look!

01:51.380 --> 01:54.120
"Proud Parent of
a Valley Glen Prep Athlete."

01:54.120 --> 01:55.710
I can't wait
to put this on my car.

01:55.710 --> 01:56.880
Wait,
what happened to

01:56.880 --> 01:59.500
"My Benz is allergic
to bumper stickers"?

01:59.500 --> 02:01.500
You never put one on
when I was playing field hockey.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.670
I wasn't a proud parent,
okay?

02:03.670 --> 02:05.880
Don't ask questions
you don't want the answers to.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.460
I knew the answer.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.540
I just wanted to hear you
say it with your face.

02:09.540 --> 02:11.750
Look, Dad, you're making
too big a deal of this.

02:11.750 --> 02:14.460
Even Mason made the team,
and he can't catch or run.

02:14.460 --> 02:15.920
But they said
to play left guard,

02:15.920 --> 02:17.460
all you got to do
is take up space.

02:17.460 --> 02:19.420
I played left guard.
Rainbow: Oh, boy.

02:19.420 --> 02:20.750
And I took up space.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.710
Do I love Mason?

02:22.710 --> 02:24.790
Maybe I should get
two bumper stickers for my car.

02:24.790 --> 02:26.920
Why not three,
playboy?
Ha!

02:26.920 --> 02:29.250
Also, I need you to sign this
permission slip so I can play.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.460
Alright, playboy.

02:30.460 --> 02:32.040
Oh!
Oh, intercepted!

02:32.040 --> 02:33.920
Ahh!

02:33.920 --> 02:35.670
Do you mind, sweetheart, just
giving your dad and I a second?

02:35.670 --> 02:36.790
Yeah.
Yeah.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.000
Go put that
on my bumper.
Alright.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.210
The back bumper.

02:39.210 --> 02:41.500
Pa-- Pass the ball!

02:41.500 --> 02:43.250
That's so exciting,
huh?

02:43.250 --> 02:45.080
Football, football,
right?

02:45.080 --> 02:47.710
Alright, sweetheart,
yeah.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.670
I know you and Jack are
really excited about this, huh?

02:49.670 --> 02:50.880
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.750
There's no way
he can play.
What?

02:52.750 --> 02:54.620
Dre, with everything
that we know

02:54.620 --> 02:57.040
about CTE
and concussions?

02:57.040 --> 02:58.540
This is all I ever
dreamed about as a father,

02:58.540 --> 02:59.920
so please don't
take this away from me.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.170
Really?
Mm-hmm.

03:01.170 --> 03:02.500
Dre, this is about
your dream?

03:02.500 --> 03:03.960
Let me talk to you.

03:05.170 --> 03:09.000
Football isn't
just a game.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.250
Alright?

03:10.250 --> 03:13.380
It's a way
to get through life.

03:13.380 --> 03:15.750
And at one point
in every man's life,

03:15.750 --> 03:18.710
there comes a time
when he gets knocked down.

03:18.710 --> 03:22.380
So I'm asking you
right here, right now...

03:24.830 --> 03:28.210
...when our son
gets knocked down...

03:28.210 --> 03:29.580
what do you
want him to do?

03:29.580 --> 03:30.790
I want him
to get back up!

03:30.790 --> 03:32.330
I said, what do you
want him to do?!

03:32.330 --> 03:34.380
I want him
to get back up, sir!

03:34.380 --> 03:38.380
Clear eyes, full hearts,
can't lose!

03:38.380 --> 03:39.750
Dre? Are you done?

03:39.750 --> 03:41.460
Yeah, I'm done.

03:41.460 --> 03:44.670
Jack and Diane
get all those life lessons

03:44.670 --> 03:46.040
from soccer.

03:46.040 --> 03:49.000
That is ridiculous,
because soccer is stupid.

03:51.330 --> 03:52.380
Andre Johnson.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.080
Yes.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.290
He's not
playing football.

03:56.290 --> 03:57.620
End of story.

03:57.620 --> 03:58.620
Clean this  up.

04:04.380 --> 04:06.080
Diane: Hey, Junior,
I need a favor.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.420
Can you take me and Jalen

04:07.420 --> 04:09.120
to the Cheesecake Machine
on Saturday?

04:09.120 --> 04:11.080
Are you asking me
to chaperone

04:11.080 --> 04:14.210
your very first date
with your very first boyfriend?

04:14.210 --> 04:15.880
And you think
I'm not gonna cry?

04:15.880 --> 04:17.330
Don't make me regret this.

04:17.330 --> 04:19.580
Look, Mom or Dad
would make it weird,

04:19.580 --> 04:22.330
and I just want my first date
to be special.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.420
Is it too much to ask
for a little magic in my life?

04:24.420 --> 04:25.750
Ah!

04:25.750 --> 04:28.040
Well, if you're in the mood
for magic --

04:28.040 --> 04:30.210
No one is ever
in the mood for magic.

04:30.210 --> 04:31.330
Hurtful.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.920
But I would be honored
to be your chaperone.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.210
Thank you.

04:35.210 --> 04:37.500
Just...
please give us space.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.290
Okay.

04:39.290 --> 04:40.620
Is this much enough?

04:41.830 --> 04:43.330
How about this much?
Mnh-mnh. I'm good.

04:43.330 --> 04:44.620
Thank you.

04:44.620 --> 04:45.920
Yeah.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.620
Still got it.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.750
I made you
a green one...

04:48.750 --> 04:50.460
Guys,
I need your help.

04:50.460 --> 04:51.880
Alright.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.080
Bow will not
let Jack play football

04:55.080 --> 04:57.120
because she says
it's too dangerous.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.750
Ohh!
Ohh!
My God.
What?!

04:58.750 --> 05:00.920
Football is too dangerous?
Really?

05:00.920 --> 05:03.620
What's next? She wants to take
away our elephant guns, too?

05:03.620 --> 05:05.000
Come on!

05:05.000 --> 05:07.460
No matter what I say,
she won't budge.

05:07.460 --> 05:09.670
Okay, but if Jack
doesn't play football, Dre,

05:09.670 --> 05:11.330
how else is
he gonna become a man?

05:11.330 --> 05:14.000
At least tell me that she's
gonna get him a prostitute.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.580
What?

05:15.580 --> 05:17.710
I'm starting to feel like
she's an unfit mother.

05:17.710 --> 05:21.250
Dre, if you decide to leave her,
I won't hold it against you.

05:21.250 --> 05:23.120
Let me know
when you leave her.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.790
Just send me an e-mail or text
or something, huh?

05:25.790 --> 05:28.830
Look, she doesn't understand
how important this is.

05:28.830 --> 05:32.500
Football was the best part
of my childhood.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.080
Hey.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Me too.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.290
Oh, the crisp
autumn mornings...
Mm.

05:36.290 --> 05:37.960
Yeah.
...the late-night
practices...

05:37.960 --> 05:41.500
the way Cindy Demito just lifted
me to the top of the pyramid.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.670
Guys, look, I don't know how
I'm gonna get Bow over her fear

05:44.670 --> 05:46.330
of Jack
getting a concussion.

05:46.330 --> 05:48.000
Eh, concussions
get a bad rap.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.670
I got one skiing,
and it's had zero effect on me.

05:50.670 --> 05:51.920
Dre: Really?
Yeah.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.210
So concussions
aren't that bad?

05:53.210 --> 05:55.170
Eh, concussions
get a bad rap.

05:55.170 --> 05:57.540
I got one skiing, and it has
had zero effect on me.

05:57.540 --> 05:59.290
There, there, little bear.
You're in a loop.

05:59.290 --> 06:00.670
Come on back. Come on back.

06:00.670 --> 06:01.920
There we go.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.080
Listen, Dre.
Dre: Hmm?

06:03.080 --> 06:05.040
Life is risky, huh?

06:05.040 --> 06:06.580
I mean,
what are you gonna do,

06:06.580 --> 06:08.920
bubble-wrap Jack so he can
never do the thing he loves?

06:08.920 --> 06:10.210
Come on!
You know what?

06:10.210 --> 06:11.880
I am not.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.170
Why should he give up
something that I love --
There you go.

06:14.170 --> 06:15.790
I mean, he loves?
Right, right, right.

06:15.790 --> 06:17.500
Alright, because
this is about him, not me.
Mm-hmm.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.750
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Right?

06:18.750 --> 06:19.960
You know what,
I got this.
There you go.

06:19.960 --> 06:20.960
Josh: Tell her!

06:20.960 --> 06:22.750
Eh, concussions
get a bad rap.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.750
I got one skiing.

06:23.750 --> 06:24.750
It's had
zero effect on me.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.000
Okay. Alright.

06:26.000 --> 06:26.880
Yeah,
you're done with that.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.620
Here we go, pumpkin.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.420
Stevens was right.
Everything comes with a risk.

06:31.420 --> 06:33.290
So I did a little research.

06:33.290 --> 06:34.710
Hey, babe.
Hey!

06:34.710 --> 06:36.210
What's up?
Bad news.

06:36.210 --> 06:37.460
What happened?

06:37.460 --> 06:38.920
Diane can't
play soccer anymore.

06:40.170 --> 06:41.620
Did she kick
another teacher?

06:41.620 --> 06:42.920
Worse.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.830
Girls' soccer has
the highest proportion

06:45.830 --> 06:47.880
of traumatic
brain injuries.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.420
Really?
Yes.

06:49.420 --> 06:51.080
Hmm.
So no more
girls' soccer.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.670
Oh. Okay.

06:52.670 --> 06:54.670
Buh-bye, girl power
and self-esteem.
Well --

06:54.670 --> 06:56.830
What?
You know,
I can't believe

06:56.830 --> 06:59.420
that shin guards
were her only protection.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.880
Well, I mean, it's j--
In football,
they wear shoulder pads...

07:01.880 --> 07:03.750
Uh-huh. Okay --
...elbow pads,
knee pads,

07:03.750 --> 07:06.080
tailbone pads, rib pads,
and a neck collar...

07:06.080 --> 07:08.040
Mm-hmm.
...with a helmet

07:08.040 --> 07:09.960
designed by the ladies
in "Hidden Figures."

07:11.040 --> 07:12.620
What?
They did everything.

07:12.620 --> 07:13.880
They're just that good.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.250
Okay.

07:15.250 --> 07:16.830
I see what you're doing
here, Dre.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.120
What am I doing?

07:18.120 --> 07:20.170
You think
you're smarter than me.

07:20.170 --> 07:21.790
Well...

07:21.790 --> 07:24.250
So no soccer
for Diane...

07:24.250 --> 07:25.170
Nope.

07:25.170 --> 07:27.290
...and no football
for Jack.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.960
Huh.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.380
Well, you're gonna
have to be the one

07:31.380 --> 07:32.920
to crush Jack's dream,
Bow.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.330
Jack!

07:34.330 --> 07:36.080
We need
to talk football!
Mm-hmm.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.960
Yeah, we do.
Oh, yeah, we do.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.080
Coach said I need
to start eating better.
Okay.

07:40.080 --> 07:43.120
More protein,
fruits, veggies,

07:43.120 --> 07:44.880
less candy
shaped like food.

07:45.670 --> 07:47.790
I mean, you've got to
put premium in a Ferrari.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.210
Do you have a concussion
already?

07:50.210 --> 07:51.540
What is happening
to you?

07:51.540 --> 07:53.960
I'm just keeping my body right
and my mind tight.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.080
Now, can you quiz me
on European history?

07:56.080 --> 07:58.920
I need a 2.0 GPA if I'm going to
play in the game coming up.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.330
Okay.

08:00.330 --> 08:02.120
So, you're making
a lot of changes

08:02.120 --> 08:03.750
'cause you want
to play football.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.080
Well, I'm not doing it

08:05.080 --> 08:07.460
because I love myself
or I want to learn stuff.

08:07.460 --> 08:08.710
Uh-huh.

08:08.710 --> 08:12.040
So, isn't there
something...

08:12.040 --> 08:16.120
you want to...
tell Jack?

08:16.120 --> 08:17.290
Y-Yes.

08:17.290 --> 08:19.790
I would like to tell...

08:19.790 --> 08:22.880
you, Jack,
that I am...

08:22.880 --> 08:25.620
so happy for you,
sweetheart.

08:25.620 --> 08:27.830
And you can...
try football.

08:27.830 --> 08:28.580
Dre: Great!
Yes!

08:28.580 --> 08:29.500
For a couple of weeks.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.040
Great!

08:31.040 --> 08:33.040
Because I've already forged
your signature on the slip

08:33.040 --> 08:34.330
and turned it in
last Thursday.

08:34.330 --> 08:35.670
Okay, that's great.

08:35.670 --> 08:38.170
Ahh! Look at
my football-playing son.

08:38.170 --> 08:39.920
Uh-huh! Working on
his end zone dance!

08:39.920 --> 08:41.710
Gooooaaaaal!

08:41.710 --> 08:43.170
Wrong sport, son,
but that's okay.

08:43.170 --> 08:44.120
We'll --
We'll work on that.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.420
Ladies and gentlemen...
Jack Johnson!

08:49.420 --> 08:50.710
Rainbow: Okay.

08:50.710 --> 08:53.250
Number 81 in the program,
but number 1 in your hearts.

08:53.250 --> 08:54.330
Oh!

08:54.330 --> 08:55.960
That's an 18, buddy.
Rainbow: Yes, it is.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.170
Oh.
I was in the mirror.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.380
That's a bad one
even for Jack.

08:58.380 --> 08:59.670
Did you get hit
in practice?
Mnh-mnh.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.540
Follow my finger,
please.

09:01.540 --> 09:02.540
Very good.

09:02.540 --> 09:04.580
Alphabet backwards.

09:04.580 --> 09:05.670
Um...

09:05.670 --> 09:07.420
A, B, C...

09:07.420 --> 09:08.710
Boom!
Oh, my God.

09:08.710 --> 09:09.920
Still Jack.
Yep.
Mm-hmm.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.500
Alright, no need
for concussion protocol.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.920
The boy
didn't get hit!

09:12.920 --> 09:13.920
Because I'm so quick.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.210
So quick. Ha ha!

09:15.210 --> 09:17.330
Yeah!
Low center of gravity.

09:17.330 --> 09:19.830
Oh! High escapability
and good hands, like hooves!

09:19.830 --> 09:21.210
Oh!
Oh, my --

09:21.210 --> 09:22.540
Like his Pops,
not like you, Dre.

09:22.540 --> 09:24.000
Wow, Pops.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.580
I've never seen you
take an interest

09:25.580 --> 09:27.540
in any
of the kids' sports.

09:27.540 --> 09:28.670
It's football.

09:28.670 --> 09:29.790
Oh -- Wo-- Okay.

09:29.790 --> 09:31.000
Ahh!
Dre: He's right.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.620
Babe.
Yes?

09:32.620 --> 09:35.920
Today was the single
greatest day of my life.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.670
Really?
Yeah.

09:37.670 --> 09:39.460
Watching Jack on the football
field was incredible.

09:39.460 --> 09:41.170
Aww.

09:41.170 --> 09:42.880
And that wasn't even
the best part.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.460
Pops: Hey, look out,
look out!

09:44.460 --> 09:46.710
Oh! That's it!
Move it, son! There you go!

09:46.710 --> 09:48.000
That's my boy!

09:48.000 --> 09:49.290
Look out, look out,
look out, look out!

09:49.290 --> 09:51.500
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Oh, yeah!

09:51.500 --> 09:54.380
You know what? Jack
being good at football
makes me like you more.

09:59.170 --> 10:01.790
Thank you, football.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.420
Are you --

10:05.420 --> 10:07.620
Are you crying?

10:07.620 --> 10:09.830
This game...

10:09.830 --> 10:12.420
has given me everything
I've ever wanted.

10:12.420 --> 10:14.290
I feel
the same way!

10:14.290 --> 10:15.790
You know
what I just realized?
Hmm?

10:15.790 --> 10:18.460
All those college football games
I've been watching,

10:18.460 --> 10:20.500
those kids
are in college.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.000
I...

10:22.000 --> 10:23.500
I want to go to college.

10:25.420 --> 10:27.080
W-What?

10:27.080 --> 10:28.710
Mom, are you --
are -- are you crying?

10:29.920 --> 10:31.540
Touch it.

10:31.540 --> 10:33.120
Yes, I am.
Touch it.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.330
I'm crying, sweetheart.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.330
Oh, God.

10:37.330 --> 10:39.500
Thank you, football.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.500
Thank you.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.620
Together: Eagles!

10:44.620 --> 10:46.080
Eagles!

10:46.080 --> 10:47.710
Alright,
that's my son right there!

10:47.710 --> 10:48.960
That's my grandson!

10:48.960 --> 10:50.420
Hi, sweetheart.
Go, Jack!

10:53.920 --> 10:55.960
Eagles,
let's go!

10:55.960 --> 10:58.080
Looking good, Jack!

10:58.080 --> 10:59.830
Okay, you know what?
I-I can't.

10:59.830 --> 11:01.790
I thought I could do this.
I can't. I can't.
What?

11:01.790 --> 11:03.790
They are
tiny, tiny little boys!

11:03.790 --> 11:05.380
My womb is aching.

11:05.380 --> 11:06.670
Okay.
That's a sign.
I got to go get a snack.

11:06.670 --> 11:08.620
Alright. Alright.
Excuse me.
Getting a snack. Sorry.

11:08.620 --> 11:10.040
Excuse me.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.460
Hey,
you're Jack's father.

11:11.460 --> 11:12.710
Yeah.

11:12.710 --> 11:15.210
Yeah. Heard some great things
about your son.

11:15.210 --> 11:17.380
Ah. Well, you know,
I couldn't be prouder.

11:17.380 --> 11:18.960
Hey, if you're
a shady college recruiter,

11:18.960 --> 11:21.210
Jack will go anywhere as long as
you buy his grandad a Cadillac.

11:21.210 --> 11:22.330
I got it. Yeah.

11:22.330 --> 11:23.880
He's not lying.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.750
Hey,
which one's your kid?

11:25.750 --> 11:27.830
Oh,
my son's right here.

11:27.830 --> 11:29.670
Oh. Well,
why isn't he playing, man?

11:29.670 --> 11:31.120
He -- He's a tank.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.750
Oh, naw,
I'll never let him play.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.580
Yeah, me neither.

11:34.580 --> 11:36.710
What? Your kid's got
weak legs?

11:36.710 --> 11:38.330
They weren't born
with the gift, like mine.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.500
Nah, football's just
way too dangerous.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.580
You got a future to think about,
don't you, bud?

11:43.920 --> 11:46.620
Crowd:
Let's go, Eagles! Let's go!

11:46.620 --> 11:48.080
Let's go, Eagles!

11:48.080 --> 11:51.080
Hey, Pops, there's
a lot of parents out here

11:51.080 --> 11:52.790
who aren't
letting their kids play

11:52.790 --> 11:55.750
but enjoy the hell
out of watching other
parents' kids play.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.380
Seems like the only thing
you enjoy is talking.

11:57.380 --> 11:58.920
Why don't you be quiet
so I can watch the game?

11:58.920 --> 12:00.250
Okay. Alright.
I'll watch the game.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.790
Where's the girl
with the beer at, anyway?

12:03.960 --> 12:05.620
Alright!

12:05.620 --> 12:07.420
You two have fun.

12:07.420 --> 12:10.330
I will stay out of your hair
but close if you need my help.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.540
That is
the chaperone's code!

12:13.960 --> 12:16.830
Wow! The Cheesecake Machine
is popping.

12:16.830 --> 12:18.960
Good job
getting a reservation.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.290
Wait.
We need a reservation?

12:21.290 --> 12:23.210
You didn't make
a reservation?

12:23.210 --> 12:25.500
Hey, it's -- it's fine.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.710
No. Let your chaperone
handle this.

12:27.710 --> 12:28.960
Alright?

12:28.960 --> 12:31.000
Heeeeeey!
Hi.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.540
So, I've got some crazy kids
over there on their first date,

12:33.540 --> 12:34.920
trying to create
some magic.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.500
They need a table ASAP.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.620
A nice one, with a view
of the Sephora.

12:38.620 --> 12:40.000
It's gonna be
90 minutes.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.250
Alright.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.210
She said it's gonna be
90 minutes.

12:45.210 --> 12:48.210
Luckily,
I know a little hack

12:48.210 --> 12:49.960
to get this buzzer
to go off, alright?

12:49.960 --> 12:50.960
Jalen, spot me.

12:52.540 --> 12:56.830
So, all you need to do
is pry the right spot and...

12:56.830 --> 12:57.750
And we're getting it --

12:57.750 --> 12:59.040
Ohh!

12:59.040 --> 13:00.380
Nice job, chap'.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.880
Okay, guys.
You know -- You know what?

13:03.880 --> 13:06.710
I know another hack,
and that is called confidence.

13:06.710 --> 13:08.000
I'm gonna get you seated.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.040
Hey.

13:09.040 --> 13:09.960
Hi.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.330
It's me again.

13:11.330 --> 13:12.710
I remember you.

13:12.710 --> 13:15.420
Is there really nothing
you can do for these kids?

13:15.420 --> 13:17.460
I mean, they gave you
their hearts,

13:17.460 --> 13:19.620
and you gave them
this broken buzzer.

13:19.620 --> 13:22.120
Sir, did you
tamper with this?

13:22.120 --> 13:23.790
Oh. Uh, no.

13:23.790 --> 13:25.290
These buzzers
are custom-made

13:25.290 --> 13:27.210
at our Cheesecake Machine
factory.

13:27.210 --> 13:29.330
I'm sorry.
Your whole party has to go.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.080
Or...just hear me out.

13:32.080 --> 13:35.580
You kick out this bozo
and you let us sit down, right?

13:35.580 --> 13:37.620
You think I want to kick
three black kids out of here?

13:37.620 --> 13:39.210
I'm gonna be on Instagram
for this.

13:39.210 --> 13:41.790
They're gonna call me
Cheesecake Cathy.

13:41.790 --> 13:43.420
Hey, you can go viral.

13:43.420 --> 13:45.250
No,
not the good kind.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.790
Not the good kind.
You know that.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.540
So, Jack
is eating better...
Mm.

13:49.540 --> 13:51.500
...and his grades
are up.
Oh, good.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.290
I mean, and now
when he signs his name,

13:53.290 --> 13:54.670
the "K" is facing
in the right direction.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.670
But football -- honestly,
I'm just gonna say this.

13:58.670 --> 14:00.420
I, um...

14:00.420 --> 14:03.580
I thought I could get on board
for watching this,

14:03.580 --> 14:05.080
but I can't --
I can't do it.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.170
You want me to be
your eyes and ears for you?

14:06.170 --> 14:08.080
Do it for me, Janine.
You got it.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.210
I'm asking that of you.
Please do it.
You got it. Alright.
Alright. Alright.

14:10.210 --> 14:11.540
They got the football,
and they're running.
They're running.
Okay.

14:11.540 --> 14:12.960
Oh!

14:12.960 --> 14:14.540
Oh, no! What happened?!
That kid got hit
really hard.

14:14.540 --> 14:16.250
No!
Oh, my God.
A helmet fell off.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.880
No!
No, it's the way
it fell off. It's funny.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.500
Who? Is it mine?
Which one? Whose?
I can't tell who it is.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.290
It's a kid with
a teeny, tiny, little body.

14:21.290 --> 14:22.580
My kid has
a teeny, tiny body.

14:22.580 --> 14:25.920
Oh! That is not
the way a leg goes.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.250
My kid has a leg!
My kid has a leg!
That is bad.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.790
N-- No, Jack's on the bench
drinking water!

14:29.790 --> 14:31.830
I should've led with that.
Your kid's fine!

14:34.830 --> 14:36.380
Oh!
Ohh!

14:36.380 --> 14:38.290
Nice hit!

14:38.290 --> 14:39.710
Glad that's not my kid.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.620
Uh-oh.
What's happening?

14:42.620 --> 14:44.670
Well, it appears
Dad's starting to see football

14:44.670 --> 14:45.830
in a whole new light.

14:45.830 --> 14:46.710
Man: Come on, Eagles.

14:47.830 --> 14:49.420
Yeah!
Oooooh!

14:49.420 --> 14:51.000
He got jacked up!

14:51.000 --> 14:52.290
Is he okay?

14:52.290 --> 14:53.500
Oh, I doubt it.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.330
Way to go, Eagles!

14:57.170 --> 14:59.080
Um, I do not think
that this is okay.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.040
This is not okay.
No, no.
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.380
It's okay. It's okay.
It's --
Oh, God!

15:02.380 --> 15:03.670
It's okay,
right, Pops?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.290
Yeah, it's alright.
It's football, ain't it?

15:05.290 --> 15:06.290
Uh-huh.

15:06.290 --> 15:07.880
Al: Phew!
That was close.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.830
For a second there, I thought
these two lifelong fans

15:10.830 --> 15:13.880
were having doubts about
this very complicated sport.

15:15.250 --> 15:17.000
Here we go.
Here's your son's big moment.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
What?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
You must be
excited, huh?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.250
Oh, uh...
Okay.

15:20.250 --> 15:21.670
Yeah,
that's one word for it.

15:21.670 --> 15:22.830
Al: Uh-oh.

15:22.830 --> 15:24.250
Now that his son
has taken the field,

15:24.250 --> 15:25.790
it's getting personal.
Yeah.

15:25.790 --> 15:27.960
Ooh, Dad does not
seem psyched.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.170
Yeah, even Granddad knows
this isn't cool,

15:30.170 --> 15:31.830
and he bets
on horse fights.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.710
Their small son
is set to receive.

15:35.170 --> 15:38.120
And, boy,
it is hitting them now.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.830
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

15:40.790 --> 15:41.960
Kick is up.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.080
It is high and deep.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.670
That's gonna give
these defenders

15:45.670 --> 15:48.170
plenty of time to get down there
and hit that little guy.

15:48.170 --> 15:49.210
Mm.

15:50.420 --> 15:51.960
He's got it!
He's off!

15:53.210 --> 15:54.460
Jack! Jack!

15:54.460 --> 15:56.460
Al: What the ?!

15:56.460 --> 15:59.000
I can't -- I can't lose
my only good son!

16:01.250 --> 16:03.420
Wow. I've never
seen that before.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.330
Yeah, this is crazy!

16:05.330 --> 16:07.420
We'll sort all this out
after these ads

16:07.420 --> 16:09.290
for jeans that make
your  look big. Oh.

16:12.540 --> 16:14.830
You carried that boy
off the field

16:14.830 --> 16:16.880
like Whitney
in "The Bodyguard."

16:16.880 --> 16:18.620
Your thigh okay?
Yeah.

16:18.620 --> 16:19.920
Is it chafing?
Uh, just a little bit.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.420
Okay.

16:21.420 --> 16:22.500
Here.
Okay.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.330
I need some ice, too.
Ohh. There you go.

16:24.330 --> 16:26.420
I didn't even complete
my first play!

16:26.420 --> 16:29.420
So, when did you suddenly
change your mind about football?

16:29.420 --> 16:32.790
It's just...
son...

16:32.790 --> 16:35.420
I love football.
Alright? It's a great game.

16:35.420 --> 16:38.750
But I just couldn't sit there
and watch people beat you up

16:38.750 --> 16:39.920
for other people's
entertainment.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.250
It felt wrong.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.750
Can I not play anymore?

16:42.750 --> 16:45.080
I'm sorry, son.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.290
But I'm finally
great at something!

16:47.290 --> 16:49.210
Everyone was
yelling my name!

16:49.210 --> 16:51.120
Dad, you were
so proud of me.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.750
I'm always
proud of you.

16:52.750 --> 16:53.960
Not football proud.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.170
It --

16:55.170 --> 16:56.330
You put my face
on a sweatshirt.

16:56.330 --> 16:57.790
Yes.

16:57.790 --> 16:59.500
Do I even have to bring up
the bumper stickers?

16:59.500 --> 17:01.620
Yeah, you'll never
sell that car now.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.460
Jack, I'm proud of you
for so many other reasons.

17:04.460 --> 17:06.620
You are
an incredible kid.

17:06.620 --> 17:09.580
And maybe I haven't been loud
about it in the past,

17:09.580 --> 17:11.420
but I promise you this --

17:11.420 --> 17:13.750
I will be
football proud of you

17:13.750 --> 17:15.120
in whatever it is
that you do.

17:16.170 --> 17:17.500
This is so unfair.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.330
Is he gonna
hate me forever?

17:22.330 --> 17:24.040
Probably.
Yeah.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.040
But all parents have to do
what's best for their kids,

17:27.040 --> 17:28.920
and you're doing
what's best, son.

17:28.920 --> 17:29.880
This is what's best.

17:29.880 --> 17:30.880
Hold on.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.000
Yeah?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.460
You're proud of me,
Pops?

17:34.460 --> 17:35.920
Yeah.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.960
Not football proud.

17:37.960 --> 17:38.960
Ohh.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.790
I mean, seriously?

17:44.830 --> 17:47.080
Heeeeeeey!

17:47.080 --> 17:49.040
I've got a surprise
for you!

17:50.420 --> 17:52.000
Is it a new big brother?

17:53.620 --> 17:55.710
I-I deserve that.

17:55.710 --> 17:56.710
I'm sorry.

17:56.710 --> 17:58.080
Mm-hmm.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.460
I was just trying
to look out for you

17:59.460 --> 18:01.750
because you're
my little sister.

18:01.750 --> 18:04.580
But I went about it
in the wrong way.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.750
Now, let me try
and make it up to you.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.210
Come on.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.460
Hey.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.380
I found a place
with no wait.

18:21.380 --> 18:23.000
Hey, Jalen.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.920
This is...

18:24.920 --> 18:26.620
magical.

18:26.620 --> 18:28.420
How'd you do all this?

18:28.420 --> 18:30.380
Let's just say
I've got the hook-up.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.250
Is it Target?

18:35.540 --> 18:36.540
It's Target.

18:36.540 --> 18:38.170
Unlike
a certain restaurant,

18:38.170 --> 18:40.120
their app hasn't
banished me forever,

18:40.120 --> 18:43.580
so I ordered a bunch of stuff
and picked it up that day.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.040
I'll be back
to check on you.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.750
But not too often.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.790
Thanks.

18:52.460 --> 18:53.960
This is so nice.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.880
Yeah.
Worth the wait.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.540
Finally a moment alone.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.080
Hands to yourself,
buster!

19:08.460 --> 19:09.580
I'm sorry.

19:09.580 --> 19:10.920
H-He's a narc.

19:12.420 --> 19:14.750
So, after my talk with Jack,

19:14.750 --> 19:17.170
I realized I was wrong.

19:17.170 --> 19:20.080
There was another way
he could enjoy football.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.580
See? Flag football.

19:21.580 --> 19:24.540
It's just as exciting.
It's just as fun.

19:24.540 --> 19:25.710
Goooooooal!
Mnh!

19:25.710 --> 19:26.500
Owwwwww!

19:29.330 --> 19:30.920
This is like
vegan cheese, son.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.580
I don't see the point.

19:32.580 --> 19:35.000
I mean, I thought we had
something there for a minute.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.920
I don't love you
anymore.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.620
Well...

19:38.620 --> 19:40.580
it was fun
while it lasted.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.120
Andre Johnson. Dad.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.790
H.U.!

19:49.790 --> 19:51.250
Dr. Rainbow Johnson.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.250
Doctor.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.670
Brown undergrad,

19:53.670 --> 19:55.500
USC Medical School.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.710
Doctor.

19:56.710 --> 19:58.000
I am a doctor.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Andre Johnson Jr.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Howard...briefly.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.330
Jack Johnson.

20:03.330 --> 20:04.790
Kick returner.

20:04.790 --> 20:06.460
Clown College applicant.

20:07.460 --> 20:08.670
Earl Johnson.

20:08.670 --> 20:11.420
University of
None of Your Damn Business!

20:11.420 --> 20:12.830
Somebody better come
and get this thing off me.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.830
I am not doing this.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.790
-Mom!
-Shh! Daddy's working!
