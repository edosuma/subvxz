that transport

00:11.280 --> 00:13.714
To selflessly rescue
imperial prisoners.

00:13.716 --> 00:16.015
They have no idea
they walked into a trap,

00:16.018 --> 00:17.551
No idea what's coming.

00:17.553 --> 00:19.653
You need to
go warn them, ezra.

00:19.655 --> 00:21.255
No, it's too late
for them, hera.

00:21.257 --> 00:22.022
We should run now

00:22.024 --> 00:23.724
You don't mean that.

00:23.726 --> 00:26.627
I do.
I swear I do.

Which is why I can't believe
I'm doing this.

I can.

Welcome aboard,

00:45.481 --> 00:47.081
The rebels are headed
for the brig,

Where quite the surprise
awaits.

00:49.885 --> 00:51.952
No guards
on the door.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.490
Just set the detonator

00:56.492 --> 00:58.726
So we can get the wookiees
out of here.

At least things seem
to be going smoother

Than our last op.

It's not an op.
It's a trap.

Hera sent me
to warn you.

01:13.810 --> 01:14.909
Run!

01:17.746 --> 01:18.979
We need to warn

But they've jammed
the com.

01:20.383 --> 01:21.949
They'll follow the plan.
It'll be fine.

01:21.951 --> 01:23.784
Yeah, 'cause the plan's
gone just great so far.

the whole thing was

03:42.956 --> 03:44.722
You think vizago was
in on it?

He'd sell his mother to jawas
for a couple credits.

But we're a source
of income for him.

all right.

He did okay.

he was with you.

Zeb, what did you do
to him?

04:04.110 --> 04:06.510
I didn't do anything
to him.

grabbed him.

We were dumping him
after the mission anyway.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.923
This saves us fuel.

They'll go easy on him.

as a binary droid.

I am not leaving you behind!

13:49.260 --> 13:51.628
No, you're not.
We're running a 22-pickup.

13:53.131 --> 13:54.698
You have
a better option?

Jump into the pit

Make sure you're ready.

All troopers,
focus your fire on --

On the jedi.

14:38.976 --> 14:40.677
Time to go!
Right.

It's not my fault!

you inspired the kid

Such a rare find
these days.

I don't know where you get

He passed the test.

What's the force?

19:11.216 --> 19:12.849
The force
is everywhere.

19:12.851 --> 19:15.251
It surrounds us
and penetrates us.

19:15.253 --> 19:17.153
It binds the galaxy
together.

19:17.155 --> 19:19.155
And it's strong
with you, ezra.

19:19.157 --> 19:22.091
Otherwise, you'd never have been
able to open the holocron.

19:22.093 --> 19:23.926
So, what do you want?

19:23.928 --> 19:25.561
To offer you a choice.

19:25.563 --> 19:27.864
You can keep
the lightsaber you stole,

19:27.866 --> 19:30.333
Let it become
just another dusty souvenir,

19:30.335 --> 19:33.202
Or you can give it back
and come with us --

19:33.204 --> 19:36.205
Come with me, and be trained
in the ways of the force.

You can learn what it
truly means to be a jedi.

of my duties,

I have encountered
a rebel cell.

made good use...

Of a lightsaber.
