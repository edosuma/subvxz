WEBVTT

00:01.151 --> 00:03.380
I got up early,
so I could figure out

00:03.381 --> 00:07.184
if there's anything around here
that I could stand living with.

00:07.218 --> 00:09.403
- You want to move in together?
- If the offer still stands.

00:09.437 --> 00:11.021
Are you kidding me?

00:11.055 --> 00:14.741
You slept with Quentin
while he was married to me.

00:14.776 --> 00:16.393
I asked you back then

00:16.411 --> 00:19.163
if anything had started
before we were separated.

00:19.197 --> 00:20.414
You said it hadn't.

00:20.448 --> 00:21.728
'Cause I didn't want
to hurt you.

00:21.732 --> 00:24.234
Here's
to your new partnership.

00:24.252 --> 00:25.669
I fronted your buy-in.

00:25.703 --> 00:27.171
How could you do that?

00:27.205 --> 00:29.289
I did it
as a romantic gesture.

00:29.340 --> 00:30.457
Yeah, well,<i>Pretty Woman</i>
may have been a romantic movie,

00:30.508 --> 00:31.959
but Julia Roberts
was still a hooker.

00:32.009 --> 00:33.710
How long have you known
Quentin had A.L.S.?

00:33.744 --> 00:34.962
From the beginning.

00:35.013 --> 00:36.773
And how long have you known
Quentin falsified

00:36.798 --> 00:39.016
trial results to get
the drug on the market?

00:39.050 --> 00:40.601
- He didn't lie.
- But you did.

00:40.635 --> 00:42.719
I love him.
So what else could I do?

00:42.753 --> 00:44.721
I am in this, Scottie.

00:44.755 --> 00:47.107
Okay.

00:47.141 --> 00:48.609
So am I.

00:48.643 --> 00:50.227
I think Mike Ross
went to a subpar law school

00:50.261 --> 00:51.728
and has been lying about it
the whole time.

00:51.762 --> 00:53.030
Just call up Harvard
and ask for a copy

00:53.064 --> 00:54.314
of his transcript.

00:54.365 --> 00:56.066
Professor Gerard's
legal ethics class,

00:56.100 --> 00:57.901
did you ever hear of anybody
ever getting an A-plus?

00:57.935 --> 00:59.987
No, he's famous for never
giving higher than an "A."

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.253 --> 01:18.589
Well, what are you
so happy about?

01:18.623 --> 01:19.623
I made bubble-wrap slippers
this morning

01:19.641 --> 01:21.642
while you were in the shower.

01:21.676 --> 01:23.010
I specifically told you
the bubble wrap

01:23.061 --> 01:24.478
is for the dishes.

01:24.512 --> 01:25.729
I also made a hat.

01:25.763 --> 01:26.963
Okay, I'm moving in
with a ten-year-old.

01:26.981 --> 01:28.465
And you love me.

01:28.483 --> 01:29.850
I do.

01:29.901 --> 01:30.934
Hey, I was thinking,

01:30.968 --> 01:31.935
what are we going to do
about our bed?

01:31.969 --> 01:33.020
We already have two.

01:33.071 --> 01:34.488
I know,
but, yeah, we do.

01:34.522 --> 01:37.241
But don't you think a new
beginning deserves a new bed?

01:38.809 --> 01:42.279
That...is incredibly sweet.

01:42.313 --> 01:44.781
Yeah, not bad
for a ten-year-old, huh?

01:44.815 --> 01:46.333
What kind of bed
were you thinking?

01:46.367 --> 01:49.670
Whichever one we pick out
after we test them tonight.

01:49.704 --> 01:52.873
And did you have
any particular test in mind?

01:52.924 --> 01:54.324
Well, now I do.

01:54.342 --> 01:55.325
See, I don't think
the store is

01:55.343 --> 01:56.593
gonna let us run
that kind of test.

01:56.628 --> 01:58.011
Yeah.
No, you're right.

01:58.046 --> 02:00.130
We should probably just test
ours before we go out tonight.

02:00.164 --> 02:03.166
Oh.

02:03.184 --> 02:04.935
What are you doing?

02:04.969 --> 02:07.437
I think that Louis
might have just seen us.

02:07.472 --> 02:08.689
Come on,
what's the difference?

02:08.723 --> 02:10.056
We're moving in together.

02:10.108 --> 02:11.608
I think it's time
we stopped keeping it a secret.

02:11.643 --> 02:13.977
But keeping it a secret
is sort of fun.

02:14.011 --> 02:16.063
- Mm-hmm.
- And sexy.

02:16.114 --> 02:17.364
And I am pro sexy--
I mean, I did make

02:17.398 --> 02:19.366
those bubble-wrap slippers
and hat after all,

02:19.400 --> 02:21.034
which is funny, 'cause...

02:21.069 --> 02:23.153
That's not sexy,
it's just fun.

02:23.187 --> 02:25.989
- It's something.
- Something.

02:26.023 --> 02:28.358
- Something.
- I made you some too.

02:36.334 --> 02:38.752
Hey, Harvey, she won't be back
for another week,

02:38.803 --> 02:40.370
so I don't think you need
to start drinking just yet.

02:40.388 --> 02:41.672
You want to make fun,
or you want to help me

02:41.706 --> 02:43.590
figure out
where to put this?

02:43.641 --> 02:44.925
A bottle of scotch?

02:44.976 --> 02:46.843
You couldn't get her
anything more personal?

02:46.877 --> 02:49.096
- She likes scotch.
- <i>You</i> like scotch.

02:49.147 --> 02:50.480
She likes me.
Therefore...

02:50.515 --> 02:52.149
Why don't you just attach
a card that says,

02:52.183 --> 02:54.551
"Welcome,
generic senior partner"?

02:54.569 --> 02:56.903
This is a $12,000 bottle
of scotch,

02:56.938 --> 02:59.389
and this is one of three
left in the world.

02:59.407 --> 03:01.224
That doesn't say generic,
that says--

03:01.242 --> 03:02.743
You're one
of three very expensive things

03:02.777 --> 03:03.910
I recently purchased.

03:03.945 --> 03:05.895
We worked it out
about the buy-in.

03:05.913 --> 03:06.997
And this is gonna
un-work it out.

03:07.031 --> 03:08.248
You know, it's funny.

03:08.282 --> 03:10.400
First it was too generic.
Now it's special.

03:10.418 --> 03:11.835
What are you saying?

03:11.869 --> 03:13.203
I don't think you have a
problem with my choice of gift.

03:13.237 --> 03:15.756
I think you have a problem
with my choice of recipient.

03:15.790 --> 03:17.741
Do you think Scottie
would even be here

03:17.759 --> 03:18.742
if it wasn't for me?

03:18.760 --> 03:21.211
No, I don't.

03:21.245 --> 03:22.796
Harvey, I want this for you.

03:22.847 --> 03:26.266
I want it to work,
and I'm just trying to--

03:26.300 --> 03:27.584
Make sure
I don't screw it up.

03:27.602 --> 03:29.219
Well, we both know
you're gonna screw it up.

03:29.253 --> 03:32.139
I'm just trying to delay that
as long as possible.

03:33.424 --> 03:35.425
You sure about this?

03:35.443 --> 03:37.561
That bottle is the reason
I buy my own present

03:37.595 --> 03:38.945
for secretary's day.

03:38.980 --> 03:40.697
- There's a secretary's day?
- There is.

03:40.732 --> 03:43.033
And you're very generous.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.073
How you doing, Mike?

03:50.107 --> 03:53.410
Are you excited or what?

03:53.444 --> 03:55.328
Excited about what?

03:55.380 --> 03:56.613
Didn't you get my email?

03:56.631 --> 03:58.165
Oh, there it is.

03:58.216 --> 03:59.416
Why don't you read it?

03:59.450 --> 04:00.550
Oh, actually, you know what,
never mind.

04:00.585 --> 04:02.118
I'll just let you know
what it says.

04:02.136 --> 04:03.336
It's so great.

04:03.388 --> 04:05.222
You're gonna love it.

04:05.256 --> 04:10.177
It says
I invited Henry Gerard here

04:10.228 --> 04:11.895
to give a lecture
this Friday.

04:11.929 --> 04:13.730
That's great.

04:13.765 --> 04:17.651
You don't even know
who he is, do you?

04:17.685 --> 04:19.435
Professor Henry Gerard,

04:19.470 --> 04:21.822
author of the definitive text
in legal ethics

04:21.856 --> 04:24.191
and chair of the department
for the last 20 years.

04:24.242 --> 04:25.809
Yeah, I know who he is.

04:25.827 --> 04:29.529
And do you also remember
what you got in his class?

04:29.580 --> 04:30.781
It's pretty hard to forget
an A-plus.

04:30.815 --> 04:32.315
Yeah, it's pretty hard
to forget a grade

04:32.333 --> 04:34.584
that never happened.

04:34.619 --> 04:39.172
No one gets an A-plus
in Gerard's class.

04:43.628 --> 04:45.178
Yeah, well, no one can recite
an entire chapter

04:45.213 --> 04:46.263
of his book from memory.

04:46.297 --> 04:48.765
But I can and did.
Bullshit-.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.184
You never got an A-plus because
you never took his class.

04:51.219 --> 04:53.854
It's a required class, Louis.
Of course I took it.

04:53.888 --> 04:54.971
Not if you never went
to Harvard.

04:55.005 --> 04:56.005
Louis, that is insane.

04:56.023 --> 04:57.390
I have a transcript
from Harvard.

04:57.442 --> 04:59.142
I have a degree from Harvard.
That's because I--

04:59.176 --> 05:04.064
Wait, let me guess.
'Cause you went to Harvard?

05:04.115 --> 05:07.701
See, Mike,
here's the situation.

05:07.735 --> 05:10.570
I don't believe you.

05:10.621 --> 05:12.989
And I don't want to call
Gerard up and ask him

05:13.023 --> 05:15.859
'cause I don't want
the world laughing at my firm.

05:15.877 --> 05:17.694
But if he doesn't walk up
to you on Friday

05:17.712 --> 05:21.030
and say, "Mike Ross,
my beloved student

05:21.048 --> 05:23.133
"who I remember,
because he's the only one

05:23.167 --> 05:24.634
I ever gave an A-plus to,"

05:24.669 --> 05:27.671
well, then, I'm gonna know
you're lying.

05:27.705 --> 05:28.722
And if you still
don't come clean,

05:28.756 --> 05:30.557
I'm gonna launch
a formal investigation,

05:30.591 --> 05:32.709
whether it makes my firm
look bad or not.

05:32.727 --> 05:34.878
This is crazy.
There is nothing to investigate.

05:34.896 --> 05:37.731
Well, I'd rather risk looking
crazy to root out an impostor

05:37.765 --> 05:40.350
than to risk letting
that impostor poison everything

05:40.384 --> 05:42.719
that I stand for.

05:42.737 --> 05:45.405
It's over, Mike.

05:45.439 --> 05:47.741
I'm on to you,

05:47.775 --> 05:49.326
and I'm gonna expose you

05:49.360 --> 05:53.363
for the lying piece of filth
that you are.

05:55.116 --> 05:56.283
Don't forget to rinse
your mouth out

05:56.334 --> 06:00.003

throwing up.

06:40.496 --> 06:44.550
Do you remember when you said
if Louis knew, we'd know?

06:44.601 --> 06:46.001
He knows.

06:46.019 --> 06:47.019
What did he do?

06:47.053 --> 06:48.520
He's bringing
in Henry Gerard

06:48.555 --> 06:50.189
to give a lecture.
So what?

06:50.223 --> 06:52.224
It'll only be the first time
you've had to suffer through it.

06:52.275 --> 06:53.776
He's bringing him in
because he saw

06:53.810 --> 06:55.144
I got an A-plus
in his class.

06:55.178 --> 06:57.512
What? No one gets an A-plus
in Gerard's class.

06:57.530 --> 06:59.865
- Welcome to the problem.
- God damn it.

06:59.899 --> 07:01.183
Donna, get in here.

07:01.201 --> 07:02.534
Why are you calling Donna?

07:02.569 --> 07:04.853
Because she's the one
who found out that Louis knows

07:04.871 --> 07:06.121
you don't have a file
in the Harvard file room.

07:06.156 --> 07:07.122
How do you know that?

07:07.157 --> 07:08.457
Because Louis's new girlfriend

07:08.491 --> 07:09.625
is the queen
of that file room,

07:09.659 --> 07:10.909
and she left him alone
in there.

07:10.961 --> 07:12.544
You guys didn't think
to mention this?

07:12.579 --> 07:14.046
I thought I handled it.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.214
She did handle it.

07:15.248 --> 07:17.082
She sent him to sniff out
your transcript.

07:17.133 --> 07:18.751
Only she didn't realize
you gave yourself

07:18.802 --> 07:20.219
an A-plus in legal ethics.

07:20.253 --> 07:22.004
I didn't give it to myself.
Lola Jensen did.

07:22.038 --> 07:23.505
I don't give a shit
who gave it to you,

07:23.539 --> 07:26.058
unless it was Professor Gerard,
which it wasn't.

07:26.092 --> 07:27.426
How many people take
the class?

07:27.477 --> 07:29.395
I mean, maybe Mike will just be
another face in the crowd.

07:29.429 --> 07:30.545
Louis is bringing him here

07:30.563 --> 07:32.264
to see if he embraces
his star student.

07:32.315 --> 07:34.883
The worst thing I can do is just
be another face in the crowd.

07:34.901 --> 07:37.069
We need to make it
so that he doesn't come.

07:37.103 --> 07:38.270
It's not gonna happen.

07:38.321 --> 07:40.155
The man doesn't back out
of commitments.

07:40.190 --> 07:42.908
His favorite quote is
"for the law to work,

07:42.942 --> 07:44.994
there must be honor
in one's word."

07:45.028 --> 07:46.528
- Who's he quoting?
- Himself.

07:46.562 --> 07:47.663
Pompous prick.

07:47.697 --> 07:49.498
Guy never practiced a day
in his life,

07:49.532 --> 07:51.583
thinks he can write the book
on real-world ethics.

07:51.618 --> 07:53.285
Okay.

07:53.336 --> 07:55.788
I'm not panicking,
but what are we gonna do?

07:55.839 --> 07:57.923
Right now,
you're gonna sit tight.

07:57.957 --> 07:59.174
And what are you going to do?

07:59.209 --> 08:02.961
I think it's time
to tell Jessica.

08:04.097 --> 08:05.431
We need to talk.

08:05.465 --> 08:07.582
- We do.
- You know?

08:07.600 --> 08:11.387
No, but whatever it is,
it can wait.

08:11.421 --> 08:13.639
This isn't something
that can wait.

08:16.559 --> 08:19.144
Quentin died.

08:19.195 --> 08:21.313
I'm sorry.

08:25.151 --> 08:28.287
I knew A.L.S.
wasn't gonna be a picnic.

08:30.907 --> 08:33.991
And I knew this was coming,
but it doesn't--

08:36.246 --> 08:39.465
Look, if you need some time,
I can manage things here.

08:39.499 --> 08:43.217
The truth is, Harvey,
I'd take it.

08:43.253 --> 08:46.288
But Lisa's on her way in

08:46.306 --> 08:49.508
to discuss Quentin's will
with us.

08:49.559 --> 08:50.893
Us?

08:50.927 --> 08:56.348
Quentin named you and I
co-executors of his estate.

08:56.399 --> 08:57.966
You're her husband's ex-wife.

08:57.984 --> 08:59.985
I doubt Lisa sees this
as just business.

09:00.019 --> 09:01.353
No, I can't imagine
she does.

09:01.404 --> 09:04.440
Can you see this
as just business?

09:04.474 --> 09:05.858
You don't like her,

09:05.909 --> 09:10.028
you don't trust her, and you
have good reason for both.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.081
Quentin asked me
to do this.

09:14.167 --> 09:18.787
Maybe he gave you
a co-executor for a reason.

09:18.821 --> 09:20.672
You're saying
he was giving me an out?

09:20.707 --> 09:22.624
No, I'm just saying
that I'm here,

09:22.658 --> 09:25.260
and you don't have
to do this.

09:27.964 --> 09:30.265
Harvey, he asked me,

09:30.300 --> 09:32.518
and I'm not going
to let him down.

09:38.358 --> 09:40.675
Mike, you can't just wait
for the ax to fall.

09:40.693 --> 09:43.812
I didn't just wait.
I armed myself.

09:43.846 --> 09:47.483
I learned everything there is to
know about Gerard and his class.

09:47.517 --> 09:49.034
Harvey is right.
This guy is a prick.

09:49.068 --> 09:50.185
He makes everybody read
his books

09:50.203 --> 09:51.453
and then doesn't even test
on them.

09:51.488 --> 09:52.905
Okay, but arming yourself
isn't enough.

09:52.956 --> 09:54.573
We need
to actually do something.

09:54.624 --> 09:57.326
Harvey told me
to sit tight.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.044
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

09:59.078 --> 10:02.197
Right, that's because
Harvey's life isn't on the line.

10:02.215 --> 10:04.967
Ours is.

10:08.371 --> 10:09.388
Ours?

10:09.422 --> 10:12.508
Mike, I am not moving in
with you

10:12.542 --> 10:16.061
because I need
a new place to live.

10:16.095 --> 10:18.597
Okay, so what do you think
we should do?

10:18.648 --> 10:21.150
What's gonna make him believe
that you went to Harvard?

10:21.184 --> 10:22.901
Well, if my transcript,
diploma,

10:22.936 --> 10:24.987
and the job you can only get
by having attended Harvard

10:25.021 --> 10:26.822
aren't enough,
I'm not really sure what is.

10:26.856 --> 10:28.657
Well, there's got to be
something you can say.

10:28.691 --> 10:30.725
Look, Rachel,
you know Louis.

10:30.743 --> 10:31.743
The more I try and deny it,

10:31.778 --> 10:34.613
the more
he's gonna come after me.

10:34.664 --> 10:36.248
I can't believe this.

10:36.282 --> 10:37.749
He is not gonna be happy
until he has

10:37.784 --> 10:40.919
a signed full confession
proving he was right.

10:43.289 --> 10:46.875
You're right.

10:46.909 --> 10:50.512
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna give him.

10:50.547 --> 10:51.930
Come on.

10:51.965 --> 10:53.348
It's all
fairly straightforward.

10:53.383 --> 10:55.017
The company
shouldn't be affected.

10:55.051 --> 10:57.219
Tim can continue
with the day-to-day

10:57.253 --> 10:59.254
while this works
its way through probate.

10:59.272 --> 11:03.358
Well, the day-to-day's
going to change.

11:03.393 --> 11:06.028
- How so?
- We have an offer from Pryzen.

11:06.062 --> 11:07.362
You want to sell
the company?

11:07.397 --> 11:11.149
I want to accept an offer.

11:11.201 --> 11:13.569
Well, that was fast.

11:13.603 --> 11:14.953
Excuse me?

11:14.988 --> 11:16.488
What Jessica is saying is

11:16.539 --> 11:18.790
Pryzen didn't waste
any time swooping in.

11:18.825 --> 11:20.993
No, what I'm saying is,

11:21.044 --> 11:22.277
before we authorize anything,

11:22.295 --> 11:24.496
we need to evaluate
if this is even a good idea.

11:24.547 --> 11:25.998
I don't see why.

11:26.049 --> 11:28.050
Our general counsel thinks
it's a good idea, and I agree.

11:28.084 --> 11:31.620
And I'm the one who's inheriting
the majority of the company,

11:31.638 --> 11:33.589
so it's my decision.
Actually, it isn't.

11:33.623 --> 11:34.923
What are you talking about?

11:34.957 --> 11:38.010
My job is to see that
Quentin's wishes are fulfilled.

11:38.061 --> 11:39.678
Are you implying
that you know his wishes

11:39.729 --> 11:41.346
better than I do?

11:41.397 --> 11:42.797
I'm implying
he's not dead a week,

11:42.815 --> 11:44.733
and you want to strip his name
off the door and into oblivion.

11:44.767 --> 11:46.801
What I want to do
is put the drug

11:46.819 --> 11:48.237
that he dedicated
his life to

11:48.271 --> 11:51.657
in the hands of a company
with the resources to finish it.

11:51.691 --> 11:54.693
And I was there when he worked
for companies like this.

11:54.744 --> 11:57.829
And he hated them, which is why
he went out on his own.

11:57.864 --> 11:59.197
You were there?

11:59.249 --> 12:02.251
Well, that's not how I heard
the story.

12:02.285 --> 12:05.871
All right,
we're not doing this.

12:05.922 --> 12:08.156
You want to sell your shares?
No one's saying you can't.

12:08.174 --> 12:12.010
But we have a responsibility
to evaluate it.

12:12.045 --> 12:14.846
Remember when you said
you'd try to be conciliatory?

12:14.881 --> 12:16.214
I never said that.

12:16.266 --> 12:18.600
Well, you should have,
'cause you sure couldn't

12:18.635 --> 12:20.185
keep the personal out of it.

12:20.219 --> 12:21.353
I didn't think
they were gonna come at me

12:21.387 --> 12:22.354
with all that stuff.

12:22.388 --> 12:23.505
They weren't coming at you.

12:23.523 --> 12:25.107
They were coming
with a proposal.

12:25.141 --> 12:29.778
Do you really think
that offer came out of thin air?

12:29.812 --> 12:31.563
I think it's possible
they waited to pounce.

12:31.614 --> 12:32.847
It's also possible

12:32.865 --> 12:34.900
that Lisa and Tim
put this in motion

12:34.951 --> 12:36.985
while Quentin was lying
in his hospital bed.

12:37.019 --> 12:39.871
And what if they did?
Is that really our business?

12:39.906 --> 12:42.658
Jessica, I understand
how hard this is for you,

12:42.692 --> 12:44.826
but his legacy is this drug.

12:44.860 --> 12:47.079
It's not about whose name
is on the company that makes it.

12:47.130 --> 12:49.197
You're saying
you agree with Lisa.

12:49.215 --> 12:51.583
I'm saying to you now
what I tried to tell you before.

12:51.634 --> 12:54.920
This is personal for you.
It's not personal for me.

12:54.971 --> 12:58.924
So before we take another step,
let me evaluate this offer.

13:03.563 --> 13:04.546
You're right.

13:04.564 --> 13:07.849
I lied to you.

13:07.883 --> 13:09.985
I lied to everyone.

13:10.019 --> 13:11.069
I cheated to get here,

13:11.104 --> 13:12.554
and if you put me in front
of Henry Gerard,

13:12.572 --> 13:13.905
he's not gonna
remember me.

13:13.940 --> 13:15.223
'Cause you never took
his class.

13:15.241 --> 13:16.441
Because I never went
to his class.

13:16.492 --> 13:17.526
'Cause you never went
to Harvard.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.944
- That's not true.
- Bullshit.

13:18.995 --> 13:20.529
Louis, please, look, I know
you have every right to be angry

13:20.563 --> 13:21.663
with me.
I'm not angry.

13:21.698 --> 13:23.898
Angry is just a flash
in the pan.

13:23.916 --> 13:25.500
My outrage is here to stay,

13:25.535 --> 13:27.953
and I will obliterate any
infection threatening my firm.

13:28.004 --> 13:29.588
I'm not the infection
you think I am.

13:29.622 --> 13:33.291
The only thing that's bullshit
is that A -plus!

13:38.848 --> 13:40.349
What?

13:40.383 --> 13:41.416
Louis, I went to Harvard.

13:41.434 --> 13:43.969
I...

13:44.020 --> 13:46.388
I just changed my grade.

13:46.422 --> 13:48.890
You expect me
to believe that?

13:48.924 --> 13:50.142
I have always been
the smartest kid

13:50.193 --> 13:51.943
at every school
that I went to.

13:51.978 --> 13:54.980
High school, college,
the first two years of Harvard,

13:55.031 --> 13:56.314
I'd get "A"s
without studying.

13:56.366 --> 14:00.485
I'd ace every test
without going to class, but--

14:00.536 --> 14:01.570
but that third year...

14:01.604 --> 14:03.121
You had to take Gerard.

14:03.156 --> 14:04.239
I could memorize his books,

14:04.273 --> 14:05.657
but his tests weren't
about his books.

14:05.708 --> 14:07.609
Yeah,
they're about his lectures.

14:07.627 --> 14:09.995
The final exam--
I failed it.

14:10.046 --> 14:11.713
I went to his office to beg
for a second chance.

14:11.748 --> 14:12.781
He doesn't give
second chances.

14:12.799 --> 14:15.584
- I had to try.
- He wouldn't do it.

14:15.618 --> 14:17.753
He wasn't there.

14:17.787 --> 14:19.621
I got to his office.
It was empty.

14:19.639 --> 14:20.972
His computer was
just sitting there,

14:21.007 --> 14:22.424
logged in
to the main system.

14:22.458 --> 14:23.892
He was about to submit
his grades.

14:23.926 --> 14:27.012
I only had a few seconds
before he came back, so...

14:27.063 --> 14:29.765
I decided to save myself.

14:29.799 --> 14:32.467
No, you decided
to give yourself an A-plus.

14:32.485 --> 14:35.020
No, Louis.

14:35.071 --> 14:37.138
You might not be able
to believe me

14:37.156 --> 14:40.475
about anything else
ever again.

14:40.493 --> 14:44.112
Believe this.

14:44.146 --> 14:46.948
You have no idea how much
I wish I could do it over again,

14:46.982 --> 14:49.668
because this time,
I would do it right.

14:49.702 --> 14:52.704
I would go to every class, and I
would attend every lecture,

14:52.755 --> 14:55.657
and I would feast
on what that place has to offer

14:55.675 --> 14:57.592
like no one ever has.

14:57.627 --> 14:59.267
But you didn't do it right
the first time.

14:59.295 --> 15:00.512
You cheated,
and now you're looking at me

15:00.546 --> 15:01.847
to help you get away with it.
No, Louis-

15:01.881 --> 15:03.665
Get out of my sight.

15:06.647 --> 15:09.482
What a surprise.

15:09.739 --> 15:11.640
Louis, please,
I just want to--

15:11.658 --> 15:13.525
I know what you want to do--
you want to lobby me

15:13.576 --> 15:14.910
on behalf of someone
who had the audacity--

15:14.944 --> 15:17.646
I love him.

15:17.664 --> 15:19.031
What?

15:19.082 --> 15:20.582
We're moving in together,
and we're starting

15:20.617 --> 15:22.834
a life together.
Rachel-

15:22.869 --> 15:25.254
and I'm telling you this
because I know what he did

15:25.288 --> 15:28.390
and I still love him.

15:28.424 --> 15:30.559
Okay, here's the problem.

15:30.593 --> 15:32.194
I don't.

15:32.228 --> 15:34.429
- Louis.
- Rachel...

15:34.464 --> 15:36.331
I respect you.

15:36.349 --> 15:37.883
I care about you.

15:37.934 --> 15:40.202
But this isn't about you.

15:40.236 --> 15:43.438
This is about Mike
and what he did to me.

15:45.692 --> 15:46.775
You know,

15:46.809 --> 15:48.843
he came to me the night
that you asked him

15:48.861 --> 15:50.729
to be your associate.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.147
I told him to go with you.

15:52.181 --> 15:53.815
Why?

15:53.849 --> 15:54.866
Because he said he had
a connection with you

15:54.901 --> 15:56.318
that he's never had
with Harvey.

15:56.352 --> 15:57.703
- He said that?
- Yes.

15:57.737 --> 15:59.871
Your shared love of the law.

15:59.906 --> 16:01.873
- Yeah, I told him that.
- I know.

16:01.908 --> 16:03.575
And I have
the same connection with you.

16:03.626 --> 16:06.161
Rachel, you're asking me to--

16:06.195 --> 16:08.196
Louis, he didn't do this
to you.

16:08.214 --> 16:09.894
He did it so that
he can practice the thing

16:09.916 --> 16:11.199
that we all love.

16:11.217 --> 16:14.720
And if you don't let it go,

16:14.754 --> 16:19.174
he's never gonna be able
to practice it again.

16:26.399 --> 16:28.183
Thank you for coming alone.

16:28.217 --> 16:31.103
I'm happy to help,
but Jessica and I are a team,

16:31.154 --> 16:33.405
and asking to see me alone
doesn't change that.

16:33.439 --> 16:35.040
I'm not gonna cut her out
of the process.

16:35.057 --> 16:37.492
Isn't that what
she's doing to me?

16:39.162 --> 16:41.830
She's trying to kill
the sale.

16:41.864 --> 16:43.248
That's not
what this letter says.

16:43.282 --> 16:44.783
I'm not a lawyer,
but I'm not stupid.

16:44.834 --> 16:47.569
It says all communication
goes through Pearson Specter.

16:47.587 --> 16:49.838
- This doesn't kill the deal.
- It tells them that

16:49.872 --> 16:52.073
they've been negotiating with
people with no power at all.

16:52.091 --> 16:53.375
No, it tells them
they have

16:53.409 --> 16:55.711
to negotiate with two entities
instead of just one.

16:55.745 --> 16:58.964
It gives us more firepower.

16:59.015 --> 17:00.682
What do you want, Lisa?

17:00.717 --> 17:02.801
I want to know why your
signature isn't on that letter.

17:02.852 --> 17:04.102
Because we came
to a consensus,

17:04.137 --> 17:06.221
and she signed it
on both our behalves.

17:06.255 --> 17:08.089
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

17:08.107 --> 17:09.974
And if you can't handle us
notifying the buyer

17:10.026 --> 17:11.359
that we're evaluating
this sale,

17:11.394 --> 17:12.527
then it makes me question

17:12.561 --> 17:14.146
whose judgment is
really clouded.

17:14.196 --> 17:15.731
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:15.765 --> 17:17.949
I'm done meeting
behind my partner's back.

17:20.987 --> 17:22.204
What the hell happened
to letting me

17:22.238 --> 17:23.488
evaluate this offer?

17:23.539 --> 17:25.440
I am letting you
evaluate the offer.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.409
You sent this letter
to kill the deal.

17:27.443 --> 17:29.578
I sent that letter
to buy you time.

17:29.612 --> 17:30.796
Jessica, you put my name

17:30.830 --> 17:32.881
on a document you knew
I wouldn't support.

17:32.915 --> 17:36.385
You are on Lisa's side.
You want to sell.

17:36.419 --> 17:39.004
This isn't about Lisa,
and I don't give a shit

17:39.055 --> 17:40.505
whether this company
is sold or not.

17:40.556 --> 17:43.341
This is about you and me and how
we're going to run this firm.

17:43.393 --> 17:44.676
Didn't we just have
a conversation about that?

17:44.727 --> 17:45.761
Yeah, we sure did.

17:45.795 --> 17:46.928
And when it had to do
with Scottie,

17:46.962 --> 17:48.980
you gave me a big speech
about trust,

17:49.015 --> 17:50.899
about how I had to trust
you had rational reasons

17:50.933 --> 17:51.900
for what you were doing.

17:51.934 --> 17:53.985
- This is different.
- Exactly.

17:54.020 --> 17:55.737
This time
it's not personal for me.

17:55.772 --> 17:56.971
It's personal for you.

17:56.989 --> 17:58.356
And you're not playing
by your own rules.

17:58.408 --> 18:00.275
This deal is wrong,
Harvey.

18:00.309 --> 18:02.644
And like it or not,
I'm still the managing partner.

18:02.662 --> 18:03.829
Not on this.

18:03.863 --> 18:05.580
On this,
you're a co-executor,

18:05.615 --> 18:06.748
and you're not putting
my name on any more letters.

18:06.783 --> 18:09.317
So I suggest you get
your head on straight

18:09.335 --> 18:10.702
and look at this deal
rationally.

18:10.753 --> 18:12.204
And if you can't do that,

18:12.255 --> 18:15.791
I suggest you step aside.

18:15.825 --> 18:18.043
Jessica, you loved him.

18:18.094 --> 18:21.096
I know you're hurting.
So is she.

18:21.130 --> 18:24.015
Whatever your history
with her,

18:24.050 --> 18:25.967
so is she.

18:37.113 --> 18:40.565
You're here late.

18:40.616 --> 18:42.317
The life of an associate,
right?

18:42.351 --> 18:45.403
Ah, yeah, I remember.

18:45.455 --> 18:47.706
I used to live in this room,

18:47.740 --> 18:49.541
work piled all around me,

18:49.575 --> 18:52.711
surviving on coffee,
delivery,

18:52.745 --> 18:55.497
and no sleep.

18:55.531 --> 18:56.798
And the whole time,
wondering,

18:56.833 --> 18:59.801
"man, is it ever gonna get
any easier?"

18:59.836 --> 19:01.870
- Does it?
- No.

19:03.339 --> 19:04.639
But you still love it.

19:04.674 --> 19:07.175
And so do you.

19:07.209 --> 19:08.376
Or else you'd be home
with the woman

19:08.394 --> 19:13.565
who loves you,
not spending your night here.

19:13.599 --> 19:16.818
- You know.
- She came to see me.

19:16.853 --> 19:18.052
I didn't think
I could forgive you.

19:18.070 --> 19:21.222
But then somehow,
she...

19:21.240 --> 19:22.574
Made me realize I could.

19:26.112 --> 19:28.229
Louis, I don't know
how to thank you.

19:28.247 --> 19:30.231
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't thank me yet.

19:30.249 --> 19:32.033
I'm not the one
you did this to.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.335
What are you saying?

19:33.369 --> 19:35.420
I'm saying you did this
to Henry Gerard.

19:35.454 --> 19:37.339
And it's not my place
to let it go for him,

19:37.373 --> 19:38.507
which is why you're gonna have
to come clean to him.

19:38.541 --> 19:39.591
You said it yourself.

19:39.625 --> 19:41.126
Gerard doesn't give
second chances.

19:41.177 --> 19:44.296
What he does or doesn't do
is up to him.

19:44.347 --> 19:47.549
That's his right, Mike,
as the person that you wronged.

19:47.583 --> 19:48.917
Yeah, but he doesn't have
to know that I wronged him.

19:48.935 --> 19:50.418
Listen to me.

19:50.436 --> 19:53.188
You said that if you had it
to do over, you'd do it right.

19:53.222 --> 19:55.757
I'm giving you that chance.

19:55.775 --> 19:57.192
Take it,

19:57.226 --> 20:00.228
or I'm gonna have to take it
for you.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.061
What are you here
to do now,

20:30.095 --> 20:32.864
take my house away from me?

20:32.899 --> 20:34.316
I'm here to talk.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.100
Well, the last time we talked,
you pretty much said

20:36.119 --> 20:41.039
I don't care about my husband
enough to honor his wishes.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.158
The last time we talked,

20:43.209 --> 20:45.627
I was an asshole.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.628
Pardon my French.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.714
I don't mind your French.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.950
It's come to my attention
that I may have let

20:51.968 --> 20:56.287
our history affect
how I'm handling this situation.

20:56.305 --> 20:57.455
It's funny.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.791
Harvey brought that same thing
to my attention.

20:59.809 --> 21:01.960
So...

21:01.978 --> 21:03.979
Tell me this.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.900
Why do you want to sell?

21:08.935 --> 21:12.470
Do you know why I lied
about those A.L.S. trials?

21:12.488 --> 21:15.774
Because I was desperate
for the research to continue.

21:15.808 --> 21:19.077
But it didn't matter.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.829
Lisa.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.747
He wasn't supposed to die.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.917
He wasn't supposed to live
as long as he did.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.702
We weren't trying
to prolong his life.

21:27.753 --> 21:31.656
We were trying
to find a cure.

21:31.674 --> 21:34.325
And we failed.

21:34.343 --> 21:36.511
You never cared
about the money.

21:36.546 --> 21:39.798
The only money
I cared about is

21:39.832 --> 21:42.934
the money to find the cure,
and we don't have the resources.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.019
Pryzen does.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.720
But they already
have an A.L.S. drug.

21:45.771 --> 21:48.607
- It's not as good as ours.
- In profit margin, it's better.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.442
Which means there's nothing
to stop them

21:50.476 --> 21:53.562
from buying your company,
burying your drug,

21:53.613 --> 21:55.564
and making a fortune.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.065
What are you saying?

21:57.116 --> 21:59.234
I'm saying
you didn't fail him,

21:59.285 --> 22:01.903
but I know how it feels
to think that you did.

22:01.954 --> 22:05.207
And I have a way to make sure
that neither one of us

22:05.241 --> 22:07.492
feels that way again.

22:07.526 --> 22:09.527
So your great plan
backfired.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.195
Harvey, I'm sorry.

22:11.214 --> 22:12.297
I don't need you to say
I'm sorry.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.665
But the next time
I tell you to sit tight,

22:13.699 --> 22:15.417
I need you to say you will.
Okay.

22:15.468 --> 22:16.468
Good, because the next time

22:16.502 --> 22:18.420
I tell you to sit tight
is right now.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.754
Wait, what are you gonna do?

22:19.805 --> 22:21.223
I'm getting on a plane
to Boston.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.674
And doing what?

22:22.708 --> 22:24.059
I'll let you know
when I get back.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.144
Why are you going to Boston?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.430
I have to see Marcus.
He's in trouble.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.315
Anything I can do?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.567
No, I'll handle it myself.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.986
Since you're leaving,
I'm going to need you to draft

22:35.021 --> 22:36.771
some language for the Sainz
pharmaceutical sale.

22:36.822 --> 22:38.573
So you're in favor
of it now?

22:38.608 --> 22:40.191
Well, not exactly.

22:40.225 --> 22:42.110
But I heard what you said,
and I went to see Lisa.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.361
She and I
are on the same page.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.665
Do you have time to hear
what the plan is?

22:46.699 --> 22:49.451
I trust you.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.587
So what do you need me
to draft?

22:52.622 --> 22:54.372
I need you to draft
a provision that guarantees

22:54.406 --> 22:56.374
Pryzen will finish developing
that drug.

22:56.408 --> 22:57.676
Consider it done.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.595
He's not seeing his brother,
is he?

23:02.465 --> 23:03.715
No, he's not.

23:03.749 --> 23:06.084
- Care to elaborate on that?
- Not particularly.

23:06.102 --> 23:08.887
You're saying
I should trust him.

23:08.921 --> 23:11.723
I'm saying I do.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.897
I'd ask how you're holding up,
but I can see the answer.

23:19.949 --> 23:21.983
Not well.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.868
I can only imagine
what these last couple of days

23:23.903 --> 23:25.120
have been like for you.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.938
But I'm telling you,
it's gonna be okay.

23:26.956 --> 23:28.823
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

23:28.874 --> 23:31.209
- But what if it's not?
- Well, then we're screwed.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.128
But that's not gonna happen.

23:33.162 --> 23:34.779
Look, Donna.

23:34.797 --> 23:38.249
I am trying so hard
to be brave.

23:38.283 --> 23:39.784
But what if Louis ends up
finding out

23:39.802 --> 23:42.637
everything about Mike?

23:42.672 --> 23:44.639
What if he ends up exposing him
and he actually gets arrested?

23:44.674 --> 23:48.643
What if he actually--

23:48.678 --> 23:49.761
God.

23:49.795 --> 23:50.795
Rach,

23:50.813 --> 23:52.333
Mike found out
that one of our partners

23:52.348 --> 23:53.982
ordered multiple murders.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.318
Harvey said he'd fix it.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.469
Two days later,
that partner was in prison.

23:58.487 --> 24:01.139
Stephen was a criminal.
This is an academic.

24:01.157 --> 24:02.907
He hasn't done
anything wrong.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.693
Well, what makes Harvey great
at his job is he knows

24:04.744 --> 24:06.828
that everybody
has done something wrong.

24:06.862 --> 24:10.832
Even the most esteemed
ethics professor in the country?

24:10.866 --> 24:12.117
The cleaner they look,

24:12.151 --> 24:14.452
the more dirt
they've swept under the rug.

24:14.486 --> 24:16.588
I'm telling you,
Harvey's gonna walk in there,

24:16.622 --> 24:17.956
he's gonna find the lump,

24:17.990 --> 24:20.759
and Henry Gerard is not
gonna know what hit him.

24:23.045 --> 24:24.462
Wednesday nights,
8:00 to 10:00,

24:24.496 --> 24:26.330
it's like clockwork.

24:26.349 --> 24:28.350
Consistency is nothing
to be feared.

24:28.384 --> 24:31.502
I wasn't afraid of it.
I was counting on it.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.521
Mr. Specter.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.023
Professor Gerard.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.308
Looks the same
as the last time I was here.

24:37.342 --> 24:39.527
Can't say you look the same
as the last time you were here.

24:39.562 --> 24:40.845
Yes, you can.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.515
I see
you're as humble as ever.

24:44.533 --> 24:46.701
We'll see who's humble
in a few minutes.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.069
And for the record,

24:48.120 --> 24:50.038
you were wrong
about how I'd turn out.

24:50.072 --> 24:51.539
I know how you turned out.

24:51.574 --> 24:54.709
More settlements than
any other lawyer in New York.

24:54.744 --> 24:56.661
More closings than
any other lawyer in New York.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.713
And settling is what it takes
to get the job done

24:58.748 --> 24:59.998
in the real world.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.873
I know what it takes for you
to do what you do,

25:01.884 --> 25:04.035
and compromising your way
through life

25:04.053 --> 25:07.038
is no way to go
about the law.

25:07.056 --> 25:10.508
I see
you're as pompous as ever.

25:10.542 --> 25:12.844
What did you come here for,
Mr. Specter?

25:12.878 --> 25:15.379
- I came to ask for a favor.
- The answer is no.

25:15.398 --> 25:16.598
You don't even know
what it is.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.066
I know you're the one
who's asking.

25:18.100 --> 25:21.186
I figured you'd say that,
which is why I brought this.

25:24.323 --> 25:26.390
I don't consider blackmail
a favor.

25:26.409 --> 25:28.226
I doubt the trustees
will care about semantics

25:28.244 --> 25:29.894
when they see that.

25:29.912 --> 25:32.396
Well, I doubt the trustees
are gonna see anything at all.

25:32.415 --> 25:34.332
Because that envelope is full
of blank paper

25:34.366 --> 25:37.118
or your dry cleaning receipts.

25:37.169 --> 25:39.587
You think I'm bluffing?

25:39.622 --> 25:41.039
I know you are.

25:41.073 --> 25:43.091
If you think that envelope
is meaningless.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.486
Why don't you go ahead
and open it?

25:44.510 --> 25:46.795
Your poker face
has gotten much better,

25:46.846 --> 25:47.796
I'll give you that.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.214
A lot of practice,
you know,

25:49.248 --> 25:52.183
compromising my way
through life.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.604
- You know.
- I know.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.640
And you talk a big game,

25:58.691 --> 26:00.275
but you're just as human
as everyone else,

26:00.309 --> 26:02.694
you smug son of a bitch.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.231
What's your favor?

26:06.265 --> 26:08.950
Find a reason to cancel
your trip on Friday.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.369
And if Louis Litt ever tries
to contact you after that,

26:11.403 --> 26:12.937
don't take his call.

26:12.955 --> 26:15.657
- Seems easy enough.
- It is.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.910
Have a good night,
Professor Gerard.

26:18.944 --> 26:22.330
Here's the problem,
Mr. Specter.

26:22.381 --> 26:25.333
I don't only talk a big game.
I walk it.

26:25.384 --> 26:29.921
And ethics is not about
never doing anything wrong.

26:29.955 --> 26:33.224
It's about making choices.

26:33.259 --> 26:37.178
And I'm not going to let you
make my choice for me.

26:38.630 --> 26:41.983
So go do
whatever you're gonna do,

26:42.017 --> 26:44.068
but I'm not canceling
my trip.

26:59.623 --> 27:02.074
- You didn't get it done.
- How'd you know?

27:02.108 --> 27:04.109
Because I know you would call
to tell me if it's okay.

27:04.127 --> 27:06.412
And you didn't call,
so it's not okay.

27:06.446 --> 27:08.631
Then why are you so calm?

27:08.665 --> 27:09.632
Because you've taught me
enough to know

27:09.666 --> 27:12.117
that it's going to be okay.

27:12.135 --> 27:14.970
- It's not.
- What?

27:15.005 --> 27:17.840
It's not gonna be okay.
I don't see what we're gonna do.

27:17.891 --> 27:19.291
What do you mean you don't see
what we're gonna do?

27:19.309 --> 27:20.476
You're Harvey Specter.

27:20.510 --> 27:21.477
What's that
supposed to mean?

27:21.511 --> 27:22.645
It means there's a gun

27:22.679 --> 27:23.679
pointed at our heads.

27:23.730 --> 27:25.964
There's 146 things
that we can do.

27:25.982 --> 27:27.483
We just have to put our heads
together and figure it out.

27:27.517 --> 27:28.817
What the hell do you think
I've been doing

27:28.852 --> 27:30.019
all goddamn night?

27:30.070 --> 27:32.237
Louis has us,
he's not gonna let it go,

27:32.272 --> 27:33.939
and there's nothing
we can do to stop it.

27:33.973 --> 27:35.357
- There has to be something.
- There isn't.

27:35.408 --> 27:37.192
Well, I refuse
to believe that.

27:37.243 --> 27:38.477
I don't give a shit
what you believe.

27:38.495 --> 27:40.079
Get it through your head.
I'm not superman.

27:40.113 --> 27:43.649
I failed,
and I don't know what to do.

27:43.667 --> 27:45.868
Mike.

28:06.973 --> 28:09.858
Tim, I thought
I was meeting with Lisa.

28:09.893 --> 28:11.560
And I thought
you were above board.

28:11.611 --> 28:13.028
I see you've read
our amendment.

28:13.063 --> 28:15.364
You drafted a provision
that if they didn't spend

28:15.398 --> 28:17.015
$100 million
finishing that drug,

28:17.033 --> 28:19.034
they'd have to pay us
an extra $100 million.

28:19.069 --> 28:20.869
I drafted a provision
to see

28:20.904 --> 28:22.854
if they'd put their money
where their mouth is.

28:22.872 --> 28:24.022
What you did was
what you always wanted to do--

28:24.040 --> 28:25.324
tank this deal.

28:25.358 --> 28:27.710
- They pulled the offer.
- They yanked the offer.

28:27.744 --> 28:30.245
Then the deal wasn't worth
anything to begin with.

28:30.296 --> 28:31.246
What wasn't worth anything

28:31.297 --> 28:33.382
was the document
you had Quentin sign

28:33.416 --> 28:35.300
making you executor
instead of me.

28:35.335 --> 28:37.836
I didn't have Quentin
sign anything.

28:37.870 --> 28:40.055
Well, maybe you didn't
have him sign it,

28:40.090 --> 28:42.174
but I know
when he signed it,

28:42.208 --> 28:43.559
and it's not gonna hold up.

28:43.593 --> 28:45.594
It'll hold up just fine.

28:45.645 --> 28:47.212
We'll see.

28:47.230 --> 28:50.149
This is a subpoena.

28:51.601 --> 28:54.019
So the next time
we have this conversation,

28:54.053 --> 28:56.572
you'll be under oath.

29:06.065 --> 29:07.449
What exactly
is he claiming?

29:07.500 --> 29:09.284
He's saying Quentin
wasn't competent

29:09.335 --> 29:10.736
when he made me executor.

29:10.754 --> 29:11.920
So let him say it.

29:11.955 --> 29:14.039
I don't see
where there's a problem.

29:14.073 --> 29:16.241
Yes, you do.

29:16.259 --> 29:17.376
No, I don't.

29:17.410 --> 29:19.511
Just get up on the stand
and testify that Tim

29:19.546 --> 29:20.846
doesn't know
what he's talking about.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.080
But he does.

29:22.098 --> 29:23.766
Quentin knew
what he wanted.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.917
They're not going
to ask me that.

29:25.935 --> 29:28.020
They're going to ask me
about his condition.

29:28.054 --> 29:30.639
I saw him, Lisa.

29:30.690 --> 29:32.191
I know what he was like.

29:32.225 --> 29:35.093
Quentin knew
what he wanted.

29:35.111 --> 29:37.763
He was also medicated,
could barely speak,

29:37.781 --> 29:39.898
and he was
in a lot of pain.

29:39.932 --> 29:42.284
But you don't have
to say those things.

29:42.318 --> 29:45.287
I'm going to have to swear
to this under oath.

29:45.321 --> 29:47.790
If making you executor
wasn't legally valid,

29:47.824 --> 29:49.374
then why didn't you say so
when he did it?

29:49.409 --> 29:51.210
Because I didn't think
it would be challenged.

29:51.244 --> 29:53.462
And thinking something
might not hold up

29:53.496 --> 29:54.817
and keeping that thought
to myself

29:54.831 --> 29:57.616
is not the same
as lying about it under oath.

29:57.634 --> 30:00.586
Well, those are
some fuzzy damn lines.

30:00.620 --> 30:03.639
I didn't make them.
They came with the job.

30:03.673 --> 30:07.459
You're gonna undo everything
he's ever worked for.

30:07.477 --> 30:10.295
Maybe.

30:10.313 --> 30:12.964
But just because you and I
want the same thing

30:12.982 --> 30:15.517
doesn't mean that I'm willing
to perjure myself to get it.

30:18.971 --> 30:20.489
Please.

30:20.523 --> 30:23.075
You said you didn't want
to fail him again.

30:39.125 --> 30:41.126
You didn't fail.

30:43.129 --> 30:46.014
You don't need to make me
feel better.

30:46.049 --> 30:47.099
I'm not trying
to make you feel better.

30:47.133 --> 30:50.469
I'm just telling you
the truth.

30:50.503 --> 30:54.106
You didn't fail because...

30:54.140 --> 30:55.974
We were always playing
on borrowed time.

30:56.008 --> 30:58.527
- Mike.
- Harvey.

30:58.561 --> 31:01.513
I wouldn't have
any of this without you.

31:01.531 --> 31:06.401
I think it's time
I cut your exposure.

31:06.452 --> 31:08.036
You don't have to do that.

31:08.071 --> 31:10.072
It's all gonna come
crashing down anyway.

31:10.123 --> 31:12.407
I'm gonna go to Louis.

31:12.458 --> 31:13.792
I'm going to resign,

31:13.827 --> 31:16.194
and I'm gonna beg him
to let this whole thing go.

31:18.882 --> 31:20.198
Then I'm going with you.

31:20.216 --> 31:21.300
Harvey,

31:21.334 --> 31:25.053
when Trevor went
to Jessica with my secret,

31:25.088 --> 31:28.173
I felt betrayed.

31:28.207 --> 31:32.177
I lost my closest friend
in the world.

31:32.211 --> 31:34.546
And I know you don't like
to admit it,

31:34.564 --> 31:37.566
but we're friends.

31:39.903 --> 31:42.654
And I'm not gonna betray
my friend.

32:13.866 --> 32:16.417
I used to hate
this kind of thing.

32:16.452 --> 32:18.586
- What kind of thing?
- Guest lectures.

32:18.621 --> 32:20.288
Hardman used to make us
sit through them.

32:21.406 --> 32:24.909
Except he gave tests
afterwards.

32:24.927 --> 32:29.747
Yeah, and if you didn't pass,
you got stuck on doc review.

32:29.765 --> 32:31.248
Goddamn Hardman.

32:32.301 --> 32:34.435
You remember
the Robinson case?

32:34.470 --> 32:35.520
Sure do.

32:35.554 --> 32:38.856
80,000 documents,
two years of prep,

32:38.891 --> 32:40.475
and five months in court.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.426
And the Friday
before trial started,

32:42.444 --> 32:45.429
he assigned you and I
to proof everything.

32:46.482 --> 32:48.232
You blew it off.

32:48.266 --> 32:49.484
And you covered for me.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.486
You did your half and mine,
then turned it in.

32:51.537 --> 32:52.487
He would've fired you
on the spot.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.205
Exactly, and I'm here

32:54.239 --> 32:56.291
because you didn't sell out
a friend then,

32:56.325 --> 32:58.293
but you're about to now.

32:58.327 --> 33:00.945
- Mike.
- Me.

33:00.963 --> 33:03.164
Friend?

33:03.215 --> 33:05.282
Louis,
I may not ever say it,

33:05.301 --> 33:06.834
but that's not
because we aren't.

33:06.885 --> 33:08.119
We are.
You know it.

33:08.137 --> 33:10.555
I know it.

33:10.589 --> 33:11.923
I just don't like
to say it.

33:11.957 --> 33:14.142
Last time I asked you,
you said, "don't push it."

33:14.176 --> 33:15.677
You knew I meant yes.

33:15.728 --> 33:17.929
I did.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.651
So Mike told you.
He did.

33:23.686 --> 33:26.354
What'd you say?

33:26.405 --> 33:27.822
Doesn't matter.

33:27.856 --> 33:29.741
Bottom line is I forgave him
because I don't care

33:29.775 --> 33:31.576
what some stupid piece
of paper says.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.161
And I want you
to forgive him too.

33:33.195 --> 33:34.946
Oh, Harvey,
I did forgive him.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.647
I just can't cover it up
for him.

33:36.665 --> 33:38.145
You covered it up
with Hardman for me.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.417
What you did that weekend

33:39.451 --> 33:43.204
is not the same as what he did
to Professor Gerard.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.256
What's the same is
Hardman wouldn't have let it go,

33:45.290 --> 33:46.824
and Gerard won't let it go.

33:46.842 --> 33:48.126
You make Mike confess,

33:48.160 --> 33:50.080
you might as well throw his life
down the toilet.

33:50.095 --> 33:53.881
Harvey,
he didn't just betray us.

33:53.932 --> 33:56.167
He betrayed the law.
He did.

33:56.185 --> 33:58.136
- That's not right.
- It isn't.

33:58.170 --> 34:00.171
But forgiveness isn't
about right and wrong.

34:00.189 --> 34:03.024
Louis, I know you value
the letter of the law,

34:03.058 --> 34:04.475
but what about its spirit?

34:04.509 --> 34:06.444
Because Mike embodies

34:06.478 --> 34:08.696
that spirit
more than either one of us.

34:08.731 --> 34:12.516
You said we're friends.

34:12.534 --> 34:15.018
A friend would not ask me
to do this.

34:15.036 --> 34:17.237
No, Louis.

34:17.289 --> 34:20.190
A friend just won't hold it
against you if you don't.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.438
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

34:50.489 --> 34:52.523
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

34:52.556 --> 34:54.025
I do.

34:54.059 --> 34:58.029
But before we start,
I'd like to make a statement.

34:58.063 --> 34:59.781
I am here to tell the truth,

34:59.832 --> 35:01.398
but what I want you
to understand

35:01.417 --> 35:03.501
is that truth is subjective.

35:03.535 --> 35:05.169
The truth is the truth.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.571
No.
The law is the law.

35:07.589 --> 35:10.908
We can define
where a legal line is.

35:10.926 --> 35:12.760
I'm talking about the truth.

35:24.056 --> 35:26.107
The truth is
much more complicated.

35:26.141 --> 35:28.109
By the letter of the law,

35:28.143 --> 35:30.778
Quentin Sainz may
or may not have been competent.

35:30.813 --> 35:34.649
I can't say what's true
with 100% certainty.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.934
I just don't know.

35:36.952 --> 35:38.536
But what I can say
with certainty

35:38.570 --> 35:40.788
is that Quentin knew
what he was doing

35:40.823 --> 35:43.407
when he trusted me to look
after his best interests.

35:43.441 --> 35:44.959
How do you know that?

35:44.993 --> 35:46.327
Because I knew him.

35:46.378 --> 35:49.080
Just because someone
can't check off everything

35:49.114 --> 35:50.948
on the list
that's required

35:50.966 --> 35:52.950
to be competent
doesn't mean

35:52.968 --> 35:56.804
they aren't better at whatever
they do than the rest of us.

35:56.839 --> 35:59.006
And Quentin Sainz
was an amazing man

35:59.057 --> 36:00.791
with an amazing mind.

36:00.809 --> 36:02.560
And if he were here right now,

36:02.594 --> 36:04.295
I'd still listen to him
on any subject

36:04.313 --> 36:06.564
sooner than I'd listen
to anybody else.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.649
That's all very touching,

36:08.684 --> 36:11.319
but we're not here to talk
about the truth.

36:11.353 --> 36:14.272
We're here to deal
with the letter of the law.

36:14.306 --> 36:17.825
Have you never met someone
who by the letter of the law

36:17.860 --> 36:19.777
shouldn't be able to do
what they do?

36:19.811 --> 36:21.913
Who beat the odds?
Your honor-

36:21.947 --> 36:24.165
We are talking
about a man's life.

36:24.199 --> 36:26.501
We are talking
about his legacy.

36:26.535 --> 36:28.619
And I dispute that those things
are less important

36:28.653 --> 36:31.322
than the letter of the law.

36:39.515 --> 36:41.215
Your honor,
what has to happen today

36:41.266 --> 36:42.216
is very clear.

36:42.267 --> 36:44.969
You have to undo
this injustice.

36:45.003 --> 36:48.689
Yes.
This is about justice.

36:48.724 --> 36:51.342
But the issue isn't whether
Quentin Sainz was competent

36:51.360 --> 36:54.178
when he made me executor,
but rather,

36:54.196 --> 36:57.681
would it have been his intent
to do so if he were.

36:57.699 --> 37:00.735
This man dedicated his life
to one thing,

37:00.786 --> 37:03.187
and the circumstances
surrounding how he decided

37:03.205 --> 37:06.690
to protect that thing
is not the question.

37:06.708 --> 37:09.360
It's a question of law,
Ms. Pearson.

37:09.378 --> 37:12.880
No, it is a question
of doing what is right.

37:12.915 --> 37:14.715
Louis.

37:14.750 --> 37:17.835
What the hell
are you doing here?

37:18.921 --> 37:20.371
- I--
- I told you I needed

37:20.389 --> 37:22.473
the Carell filings by lunch--
you didn't get that done,

37:22.507 --> 37:24.725
so now you don't get to listen
to this lecture.

37:24.760 --> 37:27.728
You do not get to listen to this
titan talk about legal ethics.

37:27.763 --> 37:29.063
You know something,
you make me sick.

37:29.097 --> 37:30.264
So do me a quick favor
and tell him you're sorry

37:30.315 --> 37:33.217
and get the hell
out of here.

37:39.408 --> 37:40.391
I'm sorry.

37:40.409 --> 37:43.611
I accept your apology,

37:43.662 --> 37:45.580
but I'm not
the aggrieved one here.

37:45.614 --> 37:49.066
Louis is.

37:49.084 --> 37:52.453
Louis...

37:52.504 --> 37:54.956
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.968
It's not my pony.
Come on.

38:07.019 --> 38:09.553
Motion to remove Jessica
Pearson as executor denied.

38:11.773 --> 38:14.558
Well, you were right.

38:14.592 --> 38:17.928
Quentin did know
what he was doing.

38:17.946 --> 38:22.116
I know how hard
it must have been...

38:22.150 --> 38:25.102
At the end.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.071
I'm glad Quentin had you.

38:27.105 --> 38:29.273
I'm glad he had you too.

38:52.797 --> 38:55.132
He let it go.

39:08.697 --> 39:10.581
I heard it all worked out.

39:10.615 --> 39:12.917
Never a doubt.

39:15.871 --> 39:17.988
I've got a present for you.

39:18.006 --> 39:20.007
Tiffany.

39:25.547 --> 39:27.664
"D.J.S."

39:27.683 --> 39:29.850
This is a present
for Scottie.

39:29.885 --> 39:31.686
Which makes it a present
for you.

39:31.720 --> 39:34.305
- Let's put this in her office.
- Great.

39:34.339 --> 39:37.558
We can put it next to your
overpriced bottle of scotch.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.143
So it was a great gift.

39:39.177 --> 39:42.513
Now it is.

39:42.531 --> 39:46.033
For the record,
her middle name is Victoria.

39:46.068 --> 39:48.119
No, it isn't.

39:48.153 --> 39:50.121
What is it?

39:50.155 --> 39:52.356
Please, she never told me.

39:52.374 --> 39:53.357
Julie?

39:53.375 --> 39:54.408
- Seriously?
- Jessie?

39:54.459 --> 39:55.659
- Oh, my God.
- Joy?

39:55.693 --> 39:57.194
- You're pathetic.
- Jenny?

39:57.212 --> 40:00.697
Not telling.

40:00.716 --> 40:03.200
I don't think
this is a good idea.

40:03.218 --> 40:04.201
I don't care.

40:04.219 --> 40:05.386
What are they gonna do,
fire us?

40:05.420 --> 40:07.421
Mike, I haven't left
before 5:00

40:07.472 --> 40:09.206
in the past six years.

40:09.224 --> 40:10.508
All the more reason
to do it.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.009
Now what do you want to do?

40:12.043 --> 40:15.229
See a movie, grab dinner,
get a drink?

40:17.899 --> 40:20.884
I just want to go home.

40:24.689 --> 40:26.941
Yeah.
Let's go home.

40:37.335 --> 40:41.088
People seem to keep coming
in here lately.

40:41.123 --> 40:43.874
I needed to hear some music.

40:43.908 --> 40:45.960
And drink some scotch.

40:46.011 --> 40:49.764
How often do you really
do one without the other?

40:55.437 --> 40:57.271
Move over.

41:16.274 --> 41:19.910
Did you take care
of your Marcus problem?

41:19.944 --> 41:23.798
For the time being.

41:23.832 --> 41:26.383
Good.

41:29.554 --> 41:32.923
It wasn't really
a Marcus problem.

41:34.926 --> 41:36.927
I know.

41:38.346 --> 41:39.427
You want to hear the truth?

41:41.343 --> 41:43.575
Not tonight.

41:44.005 --> 41:45.909
That's why I didn't tell you
in the first place.

41:48.488 --> 41:50.189
I know.
