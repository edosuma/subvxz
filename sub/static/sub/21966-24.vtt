00:04.583 --> 00:06.458
HUXLEY:

00:04.583 --> 00:06.458
Take your temperature,

00:06.500 --> 00:10.125
'cause Griffin Rock

00:06.500 --> 00:10.125
has dolphin fever.

00:10.166 --> 00:13.000
Hello, everyone.

00:10.166 --> 00:13.000
I'm Huxley Prescott,

00:13.041 --> 00:17.458
and this is opening day

00:13.041 --> 00:17.458
of the Dolphin Wonder Festival.

00:22.542 --> 00:24.333
( horns honking )

00:24.375 --> 00:26.834
Sir, I had no idea

00:24.375 --> 00:26.834
Griffin Rock possessed

00:26.875 --> 00:28.291
this many licensed drivers.

00:28.333 --> 00:29.667
A lot of visitors, Chase.

00:29.709 --> 00:31.041
They come over on the ferry.

00:31.083 --> 00:33.291
First day of the festival

00:31.083 --> 00:33.291
is always like this.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.417
I must admit,

00:33.333 --> 00:35.417
I fail to see the appeal

00:35.458 --> 00:38.166
of watching identical sea

00:35.458 --> 00:38.166
mammals swim past the island.

00:38.208 --> 00:40.667
I just hope it turns out

00:38.208 --> 00:40.667
better than last year.

00:40.709 --> 00:43.542
Hardly any dolphins showed up.

00:43.583 --> 00:46.125
Ha, ha, ha. The mayor resorted

00:43.583 --> 00:46.125
to wearing a dolphin suit

00:46.166 --> 00:47.625
to keep the tourists

00:46.166 --> 00:47.625
from leaving.

00:47.667 --> 00:50.000
He made little kids cry.

(  light dramatic theme playing  )

00:56.041 --> 00:57.500
( wood cracks )

01:00.166 --> 01:05.041
We're now here at the marina

01:00.166 --> 01:05.041
where I spy with my little eye

01:05.083 --> 01:07.875
a glint of sunlight,

01:05.083 --> 01:07.875
a clump of seaweed

01:07.917 --> 01:13.166
or maybe the first dolphin

01:07.917 --> 01:13.166
of the festival.

On our way.

Chase,

02:53.291 --> 02:55.125
time to stretch your legs.

Gladly, sir.

I'm Huxley Prescott.

(  upbeat theme playing  )

03:54.542 --> 03:55.959
( horn blowing )

03:56.000 --> 04:00.500
More cars.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.500
I really shouldn't be leaving.

04:00.542 --> 04:02.208
Oh, go have fun, Dad.

04:02.250 --> 04:05.333
We'll be fine.

04:02.250 --> 04:05.333
We can take care of ourselves.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.875
Please stay. The last time

04:05.375 --> 04:07.875
Kade was in charge

04:07.917 --> 04:10.000
he made us wax

04:07.917 --> 04:10.000
the garage floor.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.709
Nothing wrong with seeing your

04:10.041 --> 04:12.709
reflection when you look down.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.792
Well, my reflection.

04:14.834 --> 04:16.750
Don't worry, Chief.

04:14.834 --> 04:16.750
We can handle anything

04:16.792 --> 04:19.709
the festival or Kade

04:16.792 --> 04:19.709
can throw at us.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.250
I only wish

04:19.750 --> 04:21.250
I could accompany you

04:21.291 --> 04:22.625
to the peace officers

04:21.291 --> 04:22.625
conference.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.333
It sounds most informative.

04:24.375 --> 04:27.041
Yeah,

04:24.375 --> 04:27.041
but always way too long.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.333
Nevertheless,

04:27.083 --> 04:29.333
please take copious notes.

04:29.375 --> 04:32.250
Kids, since Doc and Frankie

04:29.375 --> 04:32.250
are out of town,

04:32.291 --> 04:35.542
I've asked someone

04:32.291 --> 04:35.542
to keep an eye on...things.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.875
That's code for babysitter,

04:35.583 --> 04:37.875
isn't it?

04:37.917 --> 04:40.667
Oh, believe me,

04:37.917 --> 04:40.667
he's no babysitter.

Hello, family of heroes.

Uncle Woodrow.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.917
Welcome back.

04:50.959 --> 04:52.417
I thought you were on safari.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.709
Wait, is this grandpa's

04:52.458 --> 04:55.709
old convertible?

04:55.750 --> 04:57.834
The old jalopy itself.

04:57.875 --> 05:00.959
We had some fun joyriding around

04:57.875 --> 05:00.959
in this old tuna boat,

05:01.000 --> 05:02.250
didn't we, Charlie?

05:02.291 --> 05:04.709
Yeah, best car ever.

05:07.083 --> 05:08.542
Indeed.

05:08.583 --> 05:11.041
And how are my favorite

05:08.583 --> 05:11.041
humans and aliens?

05:11.083 --> 05:13.125
( all shushing )

05:13.166 --> 05:16.041
A little louder. The rest

05:13.166 --> 05:16.041
of the island didn't hear you.

05:16.083 --> 05:19.000
What? You're still keeping

05:16.083 --> 05:19.000
that a secret around here?

05:19.041 --> 05:21.458
Yes, and so are you.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.041
Oh. Gotcha.

05:24.083 --> 05:27.000
But hey, Cybertronians,

05:24.083 --> 05:27.000
let's chat later, huh?

05:27.041 --> 05:29.000
I wanna hear more about

05:27.041 --> 05:29.000
your world

05:29.041 --> 05:31.083
and your culture.

05:29.041 --> 05:31.083
We'd love to.

05:31.125 --> 05:34.000
The festival will be keeping

05:31.125 --> 05:34.000
everyone plenty occupied.

05:34.041 --> 05:37.166
And I expect Cody and I will be

05:34.041 --> 05:37.166
running the joint, right?

05:37.208 --> 05:38.500
( chuckles )

05:38.542 --> 05:41.000
Woodrow,

05:38.542 --> 05:41.000
we talked about this.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.542
Just kidding, Charlie.

05:43.583 --> 05:46.250
I won't participate

05:43.583 --> 05:46.250
in the rescues.

05:46.291 --> 05:49.417
Hey, I'm not "official."

05:49.458 --> 05:51.667
Did you bring us any cool gifts,

05:49.458 --> 05:51.667
Uncle Woodrow?

05:51.709 --> 05:53.583
From my safari...

05:53.625 --> 05:55.917
dry-roasted beetles.

05:55.959 --> 05:58.375
You can't eat just one.

05:58.417 --> 06:00.458
I'll take your word for it.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.959
( ferry horn blowing )

06:03.000 --> 06:07.125
Well, that's my cue.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.125
I'll see you all next week.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.875
Bye, Dad.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.875
We'll be fine, Charlie.

06:09.917 --> 06:13.041
Since I can't be seen without a

06:09.917 --> 06:13.041
driver, I will be walking home.

06:13.083 --> 06:14.458
Care to join me, Cody?

06:14.500 --> 06:17.208
Nah, Little Chief

06:14.500 --> 06:17.208
is cruising it old school

06:17.250 --> 06:18.709
with his uncle, right?

06:18.750 --> 06:21.959
You bet.

06:18.750 --> 06:21.959
See you at home, Chase.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.166
Of course.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.166

06:41.000 --> 06:42.375
Ah, he won't mind.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.542
Besides,

06:42.417 --> 06:44.542
I need to get into the kitchen.

06:44.583 --> 06:46.709
I have big plans for dinner.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.500
Cool. Whatcha fixin'?

06:50.166 --> 06:52.208
Baked Hacka-Louie!

06:52.250 --> 06:55.417
A little recipe I picked up

06:52.250 --> 06:55.417
in the Calliope Rainforest.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.542
What's in it?

06:57.583 --> 07:00.375
A cornucopia of ingredients.

07:00.417 --> 07:03.500
But since you didn't have any

07:00.417 --> 07:03.500
eggs from the Wompoo Fruit-dove,

07:03.542 --> 07:05.166
I had to improvise.

07:05.208 --> 07:06.458
( sniffs )

07:06.500 --> 07:07.959
Ugh. Smells like feet.

Graham's feet.

07:10.834 --> 07:12.792

Tastes pretty good.

07:14.583 --> 07:15.875

07:15.917 --> 07:18.041
Got a kick to it.

07:15.917 --> 07:18.041
A little crunchy.

07:18.083 --> 07:19.792
Mmm. Interesting.

07:18.083 --> 07:19.792
( laughs )

07:19.834 --> 07:23.208
Told you those roasted beetles

07:19.834 --> 07:23.208
were yummy.

07:24.667 --> 07:28.250
You're dripping oil, aren't you?

07:28.291 --> 07:30.041
(  upbeat theme playing  )

07:30.083 --> 07:32.709
MAYOR:

07:30.083 --> 07:32.709
This ought to be far enough.

07:34.333 --> 07:37.500
Now, let's get this

07:34.333 --> 07:37.500
over with.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.917
I have serious doubts

07:38.959 --> 07:40.917
these beacons

07:40.959 --> 07:43.250
will attract dolphins

07:40.959 --> 07:43.250
to the island, sir.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.917
The ad said they emit

07:43.291 --> 07:45.917
the "whooshing sound

07:45.959 --> 07:48.750
of a swimming squid."

07:45.959 --> 07:48.750
Dolphins like squid.

07:48.792 --> 07:50.500
What could go wrong?

07:50.542 --> 07:52.583
You bought them

07:50.542 --> 07:52.583
at a flea market, mayor.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.375
With a coupon.

07:54.417 --> 07:58.417
Look, it's this, or you're

07:54.417 --> 07:58.417
wearing that dolphin costume.

07:58.458 --> 08:01.375
Um, let's check the directions.

08:01.417 --> 08:03.083
Check the direct--

08:03.125 --> 08:06.917
No need, the beacons

08:03.125 --> 08:06.917
are water-activated.

08:08.583 --> 08:10.208
( beeps )

08:10.250 --> 08:13.333
Yeah, with dolphins chasing

08:10.250 --> 08:13.333
these little wonders

08:13.375 --> 08:16.959
around the island,

08:13.375 --> 08:16.959
tourists will be here all week.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.709
( laughs )

08:18.750 --> 08:21.291
Says here to release one

08:18.750 --> 08:21.291
every 50 feet

08:21.333 --> 08:24.625
to avoid interference

08:21.333 --> 08:24.625
with boat operations.

08:24.667 --> 08:28.417
Time is of the essence,

08:24.667 --> 08:28.417

08:54.875 --> 08:57.208
to school, Uncle Woodrow.

08:57.250 --> 08:59.542
Most of the time

08:57.250 --> 08:59.542
I just take my hover-board.

08:59.583 --> 09:02.291
No trouble at all,

08:59.583 --> 09:02.291
Little Chief.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.875
Gives me a chance

09:02.333 --> 09:03.875
to drive Chase.

09:03.917 --> 09:05.291
How ya doing, anyway,

09:03.917 --> 09:05.291
Chase?

09:05.333 --> 09:07.083
Fine, sir.

09:07.125 --> 09:10.166
Exactly how long will you

09:07.125 --> 09:10.166
and your car be in town?

09:10.208 --> 09:12.500
( beeping )

09:10.208 --> 09:12.500
Emergency Dispatch.

09:12.542 --> 09:15.709
Help! My yacht is

09:12.542 --> 09:15.709
on a collision course

09:15.750 --> 09:17.542
with the south shore!

09:17.583 --> 09:19.792
We're coming, Mr. Mayor.

09:19.834 --> 09:22.583
Team, the mayor's yacht is about

09:19.834 --> 09:22.583
to crash into the beach.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.417
We have to respond,

09:22.625 --> 09:24.417
Uncle Woodrow.

09:24.458 --> 09:27.083
Hot dog!

09:24.458 --> 09:27.083
I'm on a rescue.

09:28.291 --> 09:29.625
( siren wailing )

09:31.417 --> 09:34.750
HEATWAVE:

09:31.417 --> 09:34.750
Rescue Bots, roll to the rescue!

09:34.792 --> 09:37.917
DANI:

09:34.792 --> 09:37.917
Attention! Please evacuate

09:34.792 --> 09:37.917
the beach immediately.

09:37.959 --> 09:39.291
( horn honking )

09:37.959 --> 09:39.291
MAN 1: The boat!

09:39.333 --> 09:41.709
MAN 2: Hurry! Go, go, go!

09:39.333 --> 09:41.709
My balloon!

09:41.750 --> 09:43.917
It's moving way too fast!

09:43.959 --> 09:46.917
It looks like the yacht is gonna

09:43.959 --> 09:46.917
hit before you guys get here.

09:46.959 --> 09:50.125
Dani, listen. Remember the game

09:46.959 --> 09:50.125
you used to play

09:50.166 --> 09:52.250
with your dolls and toy boats

09:50.166 --> 09:52.250
down by the creek?

09:52.291 --> 09:53.875
Yeah? Why bring that up?

09:53.917 --> 09:55.500
Blades can be the ramp.

09:55.542 --> 09:57.250
ALL:

09:55.542 --> 09:57.250
Be the what?

09:57.291 --> 09:58.500
Be the what?

09:58.542 --> 10:00.667
I think it'll work, Dani.

09:58.542 --> 10:00.667
Hurry.

10:00.709 --> 10:03.000
Oh, boy.

10:00.709 --> 10:03.000
What "oh, boy"?

10:03.041 --> 10:05.083
You know I don't like

10:03.041 --> 10:05.083
"oh, boys."

10:05.125 --> 10:07.500
Drop into the surf, Blades,

10:05.125 --> 10:07.500
and convert to Bot Mode.

10:07.542 --> 10:09.041
Oh...

10:14.500 --> 10:16.542
Now fall forward

10:14.500 --> 10:16.542
and prop yourself up.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.375
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

10:19.417 --> 10:20.917
Oh, boy.

10:20.959 --> 10:22.417
( grunts )

10:22.458 --> 10:24.542
( sirens wailing )

10:27.750 --> 10:30.667
Of all the hare-brained ideas.

10:31.875 --> 10:33.291
( both screaming )

10:40.500 --> 10:41.792
Hey, it worked.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.458
( grunts )

10:44.500 --> 10:48.375
Someone...is getting a medal

10:44.500 --> 10:48.375
for this.

10:48.417 --> 10:50.291
( sighs )

10:54.709 --> 10:58.083
( crackling )

10:58.125 --> 10:59.667
Hmm.

10:59.709 --> 11:03.709
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

11:05.792 --> 11:08.125
It's a water beacon,

11:05.792 --> 11:08.125
all right.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.834
Advertised as a dolphin lure.

11:10.875 --> 11:13.709
I wonder if the mayor was

11:10.875 --> 11:13.709
dropping those in the ocean.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.291
Wouldn't put it past him.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.291
Doesn't seem right

11:15.333 --> 11:17.291
making dolphins go

11:17.333 --> 11:18.625
where they don't want to.

11:20.625 --> 11:22.458
( dolphin chatters )

11:24.542 --> 11:27.041
( all clamoring )

11:30.458 --> 11:34.000
And according to our own

11:30.458 --> 11:34.000
emergency responders,

11:34.041 --> 11:38.166
credit for this morning's

11:34.041 --> 11:38.166
daring rescue belongs to...

11:38.208 --> 11:39.875
Woodrow Burns!

11:39.917 --> 11:41.792
Good job, Uncle Woodrow!

11:39.917 --> 11:41.792
Yeah! Noble.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.333
( whistles )

11:43.375 --> 11:46.750
Therefore, until the return

11:43.375 --> 11:46.750
of Chief Burns...

11:46.792 --> 11:48.959
I am naming Woodrow

11:49.000 --> 11:52.291
temporary acting chief

11:49.000 --> 11:52.291
of Griffin Rock.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.458
I love Uncle Woodrow,

11:52.333 --> 11:54.458
but there's no way

11:54.500 --> 11:56.625
he's telling us

11:54.500 --> 11:56.625
how to do our jobs.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.625
Chief Woodrow,

11:56.667 --> 11:58.625
your reaction?

11:58.667 --> 12:02.250
Well, I'm...speechless.

12:02.291 --> 12:03.875
Mayor, how about

12:02.291 --> 12:03.875
a few words?

12:03.917 --> 12:06.500
Though I am reminded of the time

12:06.542 --> 12:09.125
I was made

12:06.542 --> 12:09.125
Honorary Tribal Leader

12:09.166 --> 12:11.417
for the Tree People

12:09.166 --> 12:11.417
of TaTooie.

12:11.458 --> 12:15.208
I was then expected to jump

12:11.458 --> 12:15.208
into an active volcano

12:15.250 --> 12:18.291
as a sacrifice to the lava gods.

12:15.250 --> 12:18.291
Whoa!

12:18.333 --> 12:22.041
I guess Uncle Woodrow

12:18.333 --> 12:22.041
is now "official."

12:23.291 --> 12:25.000
Chase?

12:25.041 --> 12:26.917
I'm ready.

12:26.959 --> 12:29.250
Uh, ready for what, sir?

12:29.291 --> 12:32.000
What does Charlie

12:29.291 --> 12:32.000
usually do?

12:32.041 --> 12:36.208
The chief can often be found

12:32.041 --> 12:36.208
working in the Command Center.

12:36.250 --> 12:39.375
Typically not wearing

12:36.250 --> 12:39.375
someone else's clothing.

12:46.208 --> 12:48.166
CODY:

12:46.208 --> 12:48.166
Dani, some dolphin balloons

12:46.208 --> 12:48.166
are tangled

12:48.208 --> 12:50.000
in the wind turbines and--

12:48.208 --> 12:50.000
You know, Dani,

12:50.041 --> 12:53.208
once when trying to get

12:50.041 --> 12:53.208
coconuts from a tall tree,

12:53.250 --> 12:55.875
I used a high-powered

12:53.250 --> 12:55.875
crossbow and--

12:55.917 --> 12:58.208
Uh, thanks, Uncle Woodrow.

12:55.917 --> 12:58.208
We'll just climb up.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.500
Kade, reports of a grease fire

13:00.542 --> 13:02.041
in one of the festival

13:00.542 --> 13:02.041
food trucks.

13:02.083 --> 13:05.125
Whoa, can't put water

13:02.083 --> 13:05.125
on a grease fire, Kade.

13:05.166 --> 13:08.625
Graham, get Boulder to bury

13:05.166 --> 13:08.625
the entire food truck with sand.

13:08.667 --> 13:10.625
What?

13:10.667 --> 13:13.542
We're equipped to handle grease

13:10.667 --> 13:13.542
fires, Unc. Thanks, though.

13:13.583 --> 13:16.208
Uncle Woodrow, maybe you--

13:13.583 --> 13:16.208
( computer beeping )

13:16.250 --> 13:19.834
Allow me. Emergency Dispatch.

13:16.250 --> 13:19.834
What?

13:19.875 --> 13:22.166
Don't worry,

13:19.875 --> 13:22.166
I'll be right there.

13:22.208 --> 13:24.375
Take over, Cody,

13:22.208 --> 13:24.375
Chase and I are needed.

13:24.417 --> 13:27.625
A man's been trapped in a tree

13:24.417 --> 13:27.625
for over three hours.

13:27.667 --> 13:29.417
Poor Mr. Pettypaws.

13:29.458 --> 13:32.333
But, Uncle Woodrow, he's not a--

13:32.375 --> 13:34.250
He belongs to--

13:34.291 --> 13:36.959
I guess you'll figure it out.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.333
(  dramatic theme playing  )

14:14.750 --> 14:16.625
All clear. No breakfast.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.625
Oh, darn.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.625
I was looking forward

14:18.667 --> 14:21.625
to Uncle Woodrow's fried

14:18.667 --> 14:21.625
lizard-tail omelets.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.875
I wonder where he is.

14:23.917 --> 14:27.417
KADE:

14:23.917 --> 14:27.417
Probably dabbing antiseptic

14:23.917 --> 14:27.417
on all the cat scratches

14:27.458 --> 14:29.000
he got from Mr. Pettypaws.

14:29.041 --> 14:30.917
( all laughing )

14:29.041 --> 14:30.917
Rawr.

14:32.417 --> 14:35.333
Oh, come on, guys.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.917
U-Uncle Woodrow,

14:35.375 --> 14:38.917
w-we didn't mean--

14:38.959 --> 14:40.834
No, it's okay, kids.

14:40.875 --> 14:43.125
I-I know I get carried away.

14:43.166 --> 14:46.917
I guess it just felt good

14:43.166 --> 14:46.917
being a part of this family.

14:46.959 --> 14:50.542
Don't worry,

14:46.959 --> 14:50.542
I'll stay out of the rescues.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.875
Well, nice one, guys.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.875
What? You were--

14:55.917 --> 14:57.333
You're the one who--

14:55.917 --> 14:57.333
Kade!

14:57.375 --> 14:59.458
( beeping )

14:59.500 --> 15:01.166
Rescue Team,

15:01.208 --> 15:04.458
we have an outright

15:01.208 --> 15:04.458
dolphin disaster on our hands!

15:04.500 --> 15:07.500
How can we have a festival

15:04.500 --> 15:07.500
if our main attractions

15:07.542 --> 15:10.250
are stranded upriver

15:07.542 --> 15:10.250
in the wetlands?

15:10.291 --> 15:14.166
Those dolphins won't survive

15:10.291 --> 15:14.166
like that much longer.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.917
HEATWAVE:

15:16.500 --> 15:18.917
Rescue Bots, roll to the rescue!

15:18.959 --> 15:21.458
( siren wailing )

15:23.291 --> 15:25.333
Uncle Woodrow, come on!

15:25.375 --> 15:28.625
No, I promised

15:25.375 --> 15:28.625
to stay out of the way.

15:28.667 --> 15:31.208
Kade, Dani, and Graham

15:28.667 --> 15:31.208
were just goofing around.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.750
I'll be fine, Cody.

15:32.792 --> 15:35.375
But Chase needs a driver.

15:32.792 --> 15:35.375
Right, Chase?

15:35.417 --> 15:37.041
That is correct.

15:35.417 --> 15:37.041
Unless I want to walk.

15:37.083 --> 15:38.291
Which I do not.

15:38.333 --> 15:41.834
Ha, ha. If you insist.

15:45.250 --> 15:48.125
Rescue Bot, roll to the rescue!

15:48.166 --> 15:50.333
Uh, only Heatwave says that.

15:50.375 --> 15:51.667
Oh. Sorry.

15:51.709 --> 15:53.792
( siren wailing )

15:53.834 --> 15:55.834
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:58.375 --> 16:01.959
For some reason the dolphins

15:58.375 --> 16:01.959
swam upriver here,

16:02.000 --> 16:05.083
then doubled back down

16:02.000 --> 16:05.083
into the wetlands here.

16:05.125 --> 16:07.792
I don't get it. Why can't they

16:05.125 --> 16:07.792
just swim back out?

16:07.834 --> 16:10.125
I imagine they're scared

16:07.834 --> 16:10.125
and confused.

16:10.166 --> 16:11.917
That I get.

16:11.959 --> 16:14.417
( sirens wailing )

16:20.500 --> 16:22.542
GRAHAM:

16:20.500 --> 16:22.542
More beacons!

16:22.583 --> 16:25.166
They must have made a wrong turn

16:22.583 --> 16:25.166
and ended up here.

16:25.208 --> 16:27.041
And the dolphins

16:25.208 --> 16:27.041
followed them.

16:27.083 --> 16:29.333
Such beautiful creatures.

16:29.375 --> 16:30.959
We have to do something.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.834
We will.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.834
Better hurry.

16:32.875 --> 16:35.583
Dolphins can easily overheat

16:32.875 --> 16:35.583
out of the water.

16:35.625 --> 16:37.250
We'll grab those beacons.

16:37.291 --> 16:39.625
Bots, carry the dolphins

16:37.291 --> 16:39.625
over that berm to the river.

16:39.667 --> 16:41.458
The current will take them

16:39.667 --> 16:41.458
back out to sea.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.959
Got it. Let's move.

16:46.709 --> 16:48.500
( chattering )

16:51.041 --> 16:53.208
Sorry about all this, fella.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.125
( chatters )

16:56.291 --> 16:58.667
( beacons shutting down )

17:07.250 --> 17:09.375
( gasps )

17:09.417 --> 17:11.125
( giggles )

17:22.959 --> 17:25.709
( all chattering )

17:25.750 --> 17:28.000
We'll only get

17:25.750 --> 17:28.000
half of these dolphins free

17:28.041 --> 17:29.542
before we run out of time.

17:29.583 --> 17:31.583
Like we have

17:29.583 --> 17:31.583
other options?

17:31.625 --> 17:33.667
I do have an idea.

17:33.709 --> 17:36.542
Uh, no offense, Unc, but--

17:33.709 --> 17:36.542
We need to do something.

17:36.583 --> 17:38.458
Uncle Woodrow,

17:36.583 --> 17:38.458
what do you have in mind?

17:38.500 --> 17:40.417
Well, if we can raise

17:38.500 --> 17:40.417
the water level,

17:40.458 --> 17:42.542
I think I can convince

17:40.458 --> 17:42.542
the dolphins

17:42.583 --> 17:45.542
to leap back into the river

17:42.583 --> 17:45.542
on their own.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.500
Convince the dolphins?

17:47.542 --> 17:49.834
I used to communicate

17:47.542 --> 17:49.834
with the species quite a lot

17:49.875 --> 17:51.667
while exploring

17:49.875 --> 17:51.667
the Marshall Islands.

17:51.709 --> 17:53.333
Even if you could,

17:51.709 --> 17:53.333
Uncle Woodrow,

17:53.375 --> 17:55.000
how would we raise the water?

17:55.041 --> 17:58.333
Good news is the wetlands

17:55.041 --> 17:58.333
are drained by only two outlets.

17:58.375 --> 18:01.291
And all we'd have to do

17:58.375 --> 18:01.291
is block those up, right?

18:01.333 --> 18:02.834
I say it's worth a try.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.750
All right.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.750
Let's do it.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.291
(  action theme playing  )

18:17.875 --> 18:19.709
( groans )

18:30.667 --> 18:33.709
I would like to see a certain

18:30.667 --> 18:33.709
Convertible Jalopy do that.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.125
Heatwave?

18:35.166 --> 18:36.667
Bullhorn, please.

18:36.709 --> 18:38.667
This I gotta see.

18:38.709 --> 18:41.125
I'm a little rusty,

18:38.709 --> 18:41.125
but here goes.

18:41.166 --> 18:45.125
( imitating dolphins )

18:45.166 --> 18:47.250
Come on, swim this way!

18:45.166 --> 18:47.250
Just jump on over, dolphins.

18:47.291 --> 18:48.875
Don't be scared!

18:47.291 --> 18:48.875
You can do it.

18:48.917 --> 18:50.917
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:54.458 --> 18:56.083
The dams are failing.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.750
Ugh.

18:57.792 --> 19:00.250
Why isn't this working?

19:00.291 --> 19:02.000
I should've known better.

19:02.041 --> 19:05.125
Wait. Uncle Woodrow, you said

19:02.041 --> 19:05.125
you talked to the dolphins

19:05.166 --> 19:06.542
in the Marshall Islands.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.250
That's in the Pacific Ocean.

19:08.291 --> 19:10.250
Don't they have different

19:08.291 --> 19:10.250
dolphins there?

19:10.291 --> 19:14.291
Yes! I'm speaking Pacific

19:10.291 --> 19:14.291
White-sided dolphin,

19:14.333 --> 19:16.500
not Atlantic.

19:16.542 --> 19:19.291
( imitating dolphins )

19:21.875 --> 19:23.834
They're actually

19:21.875 --> 19:23.834
listening to him.

19:23.875 --> 19:25.917
I wanna speak dolphin.

19:25.959 --> 19:27.709
( chattering )

19:27.750 --> 19:29.166
( chattering )

19:29.208 --> 19:31.125
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:35.500 --> 19:38.291
Whoa.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.291
Oh, yeah!

19:40.625 --> 19:42.041
Noble.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.250
( all chattering )

19:48.291 --> 19:49.834
Uncle Woodrow,

19:49.875 --> 19:51.750
don't ever think

19:49.875 --> 19:51.750
you're not part of this family.

19:51.792 --> 19:56.208
Only a Burns could pull

19:51.792 --> 19:56.208
something like that off.

19:59.125 --> 20:01.625
( all cheering )

20:04.792 --> 20:07.875
Now I see why people

20:04.792 --> 20:07.875
come out here to watch 'em.

20:07.917 --> 20:10.667
I want a dolphin.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.083
Well, maybe just one

20:10.709 --> 20:13.083
of those balloons?

20:13.125 --> 20:15.125
Ha, ha, ha!

20:15.166 --> 20:17.667
The festival is saved.

20:17.709 --> 20:21.583
Uh-- Mr. Alper,

20:17.709 --> 20:21.583
you can change now.

20:25.166 --> 20:28.125
Mmm, homemade pizza.

20:28.166 --> 20:30.834
The perfect

20:28.166 --> 20:30.834
welcome home feast.

20:30.875 --> 20:32.417
Thanks for fixing it,

20:30.875 --> 20:32.417
Woodrow.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.792
I love cooking

20:32.458 --> 20:34.792
for my family.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.709
Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.709
Mmm.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.583
No hint of feet at all.

20:39.625 --> 20:43.000
I realize my culinary choices

20:39.625 --> 20:43.000
are kind of unusual.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.000
But once you get past

20:43.041 --> 20:45.000
first impressions,

20:45.041 --> 20:46.375
they're not so bad,

20:45.041 --> 20:46.375
are they?

20:46.417 --> 20:48.000
Ha, ha.

20:46.417 --> 20:48.000
Maybe kinda like me.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.750
That's my brother,

20:48.041 --> 20:50.750
an acquired taste.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.208
Mmm. This really is good.

20:53.250 --> 20:56.083
And some people don't think

20:53.250 --> 20:56.083
bat-milk cheese is very tasty.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.834
( laughs )

20:57.875 --> 21:00.875
Kidding.

20:57.875 --> 21:00.875
Ever try milking a bat?

21:00.917 --> 21:03.041
They're very moody.

21:03.083 --> 21:05.250
( all laughing )

21:05.291 --> 21:08.709
This isn't really

21:05.291 --> 21:08.709
bat-milk cheese, is it?

21:08.750 --> 21:11.667
(  light dramatic theme playing  )

21:11.709 --> 21:13.875
Although I will have to clean up

21:11.709 --> 21:13.875
your oil spot,

21:13.917 --> 21:15.709
you have safeguarded

21:13.917 --> 21:15.709
your humans.

21:15.750 --> 21:19.125
For that you have my respect.

21:19.166 --> 21:22.166
( engine sputtering )

21:22.208 --> 21:24.375
Take care of everyone,

21:22.208 --> 21:24.375
Little Chief!

21:24.417 --> 21:25.625
Bye,

21:24.417 --> 21:25.625
Uncle Woodrow!

21:25.667 --> 21:26.875
Thanks again!

21:25.667 --> 21:26.875
So long, Unc!

21:26.917 --> 21:28.959
Safe travels.

21:26.917 --> 21:28.959
Send a postcard.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.250
( backfires )

21:31.917 --> 21:34.125
