00:09.120 --> 00:10.190
What's happening to me?

00:10.880 --> 00:12.678
It's called Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

00:12.840 --> 00:16.231
A rare but serious reaction
to the medicine you've been taking.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.354
You said you could help.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.352
We've done everything we can,
Mr. Blake.

00:21.520 --> 00:25.070
Our goal is to make you comfortable.
Can you describe what you're feeling?

00:25.240 --> 00:27.391
What do you mean,
"everything we can"?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.992
I can't... I can't...

00:30.160 --> 00:32.436
I'm sorry you haven't responded
to our treatment.

00:32.600 --> 00:36.150
I hope it's some small consolation that
what we learned from treating you...

00:36.320 --> 00:38.391
...will help others in your situation.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.279
He's the second one this week.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.279
He knew the odds.

00:53.440 --> 00:55.511
The morgue is filled to capacity.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.080
Please.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.595
Please, God.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.911
Please.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.198
Use the bone saw.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.876
Mr. Kirk, you're being charged under...

01:22.040 --> 01:25.078
...Title 18, Chapter 113B
of the United States Code:

01:25.240 --> 01:28.199
Acts of Terrorism Transcending
National Boundaries.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.153
Whomsoever kills, maims...

01:30.360 --> 01:33.637
...or creates substantial risk of harm
to any agent of the U.S. government...

01:33.800 --> 01:36.679
...is guilty of violating this statute.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.992
That's a fancy way of saying
you killed a lot of good men.

01:40.680 --> 01:41.830
Anything you wanna say?

01:45.920 --> 01:47.354
Then we're done here.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.553
<i>You know the truth, Masha.</i>

01:55.400 --> 01:58.120
<i>If this is what it took
for you to call me "father"...</i>

01:58.280 --> 02:00.476
<i>...it was worth it.</i>

02:10.840 --> 02:13.150
Have you ever been spearfishing?
You should go.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.636
I love spearfishing.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.110
On the Ambergris Caye,
there is a reef...

02:18.320 --> 02:21.199
If there's a reason you felt this story
couldn't wait, I'd love to hear it...

02:21.360 --> 02:23.670
...but quickly, if possible.

02:25.280 --> 02:29.479
I have a Blacklister for you.
They call him The Coroner.

02:29.640 --> 02:33.634
I just got my baby back.
My husband, my family. This can wait.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.119
Lionfish.

02:36.480 --> 02:37.596
Lionfish?

02:37.800 --> 02:41.999
An aggressive, invasive species.
Threatens the local habitat.

02:42.160 --> 02:45.915
Leaves destruction in its wake.
Sound like anyone we know?

02:46.080 --> 02:48.800
Whatever destruction
Kirk has caused is over.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.389
I took aim and released.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.512
In the water, it sounded like...

02:54.680 --> 02:58.310
...a dull thud, but the spear passed
clear through.

02:58.480 --> 03:02.360
I'd already bagged six of them
with glancing blows, tail shots...

03:02.520 --> 03:05.752
...so I knew this last predator
was mine.

03:05.920 --> 03:10.073
The destruction it had caused
was over.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.959
And then...

03:12.920 --> 03:14.195
...it wriggled free.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.589
- Kirk isn't wriggling anywhere.
- But he will, Lizzy.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.314
With the help of someone inside.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.279
We caught the Thrushes,
arrested his mole.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.352
- Who else is there?
- You.

03:24.680 --> 03:27.878
- You think I'm gonna help Kirk escape?
- I think you're compassionate.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.032
You believe he's your father.

03:30.200 --> 03:34.513
When push comes to shove,
your impulse will be to save him.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.632
Fine. I'll bite.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.359
Tell me more.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.920
According to Reddington...

03:41.080 --> 03:44.232
...The Coroner runs
a witness-protection program for criminals.

03:44.400 --> 03:48.394
He provides them with new lives,
fully documented from cradle to present.

03:48.560 --> 03:52.554
Then he takes the identities of the dead
and manages to keep them alive on paper.

03:53.040 --> 03:57.432
Elementary-school report cards, marriage
licenses, confirmation certificates.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.320
He then takes these
meticulously crafted identities...

04:00.480 --> 04:03.120
...and sells them to
the world's most dangerous criminals.

04:03.280 --> 04:06.591
- How does this relate to Kirk?
- Reddington believes Kirk will escape.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.992
And that when he does,
The Coroner will help him vanish.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.675
Did Reddington tell you
how Kirk was going to escape?

04:12.840 --> 04:14.274
No, because he's not going to.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.870
This Coroner, how does Reddington
know he exists?

04:17.040 --> 04:19.509
Well, apparently,
he lost a job to The Coroner.

04:19.680 --> 04:23.276
- Her name was Giza Barrera.
- I know that name.

04:23.440 --> 04:27.275
Barrera's father was a Mexican drug
trafficker who forced her to marry a rival...

04:27.440 --> 04:29.159
...when she was 14 years old.

04:29.320 --> 04:33.280
Twenty years later, she got her revenge
by murdering her father and his rival...

04:33.440 --> 04:35.591
...uniting their cartels
under her leadership.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.592
The other cartels felt threatened, so...

04:37.760 --> 04:41.674
...six years later, 60,000 people were
dead and Giza Barrera disappeared.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.190
Thanks to an identity
sold to her by The Coroner.

04:44.360 --> 04:47.000
Now, Barrera was raised in a convent.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.595
Apparently, her father
also was a devout Catholic...

04:49.760 --> 04:51.717
...who insisted his child learn Latin.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.837
Latin. That's your lead.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.038
People are creatures of habit.
They gravitate to what they know.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.556
Barrera may have gotten
a new life and identity...

04:59.720 --> 05:02.474
...but she's the same person
with the same skill set...

05:02.640 --> 05:04.996
...and we figured
she'd use one to make a living.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.920
I wrote an algorithm to search schools
that require Latin...

05:08.120 --> 05:11.192
...and cross-indexed it with a web search
of tutoring services...

05:11.360 --> 05:13.750
...that teach Latin, and, well...

05:15.120 --> 05:18.238
This woman works at a private school
in Brooklyn Heights.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.357
- Think it could be her?
- Let's ask her.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.354
Ressler, Navabi, check it out.
If it is Barrera...

05:23.520 --> 05:26.160
...I wanna know how she made contact
with this Coroner.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.912
It's okay to talk with him.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.560
He said he won't talk to anyone
without a lawyer present.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.200
Not about the case, no.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.313
I'm sure he would talk about you.
Your past.

05:45.480 --> 05:48.473
You're his daughter, Elizabeth.
That's a lot to process.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.280
The only way to start
is by talking with him.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.793
I feel like you deserve some clarity
on what's about to happen.

06:07.120 --> 06:11.797
They're transferring you to Fort McNair
where you'll be held until your hearing.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.076
You'll have access to your lawyers...

06:13.240 --> 06:16.153
Did you mean what you said
when you called me "father"?

06:16.800 --> 06:17.790
Yes.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.758
And yet you picked Reddington.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.559
I picked myself.

06:24.720 --> 06:28.350
You said you were trying to protect Agnes
from Reddington. That's my decision.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.558
And Tom's, but no one else's.
Not even my father's.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.079
You remind me so much of her.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.189
Your mother.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.079
She was an amazing woman.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.872
I've been wanting to tell you about her.
I thought we had more time.

06:43.880 --> 06:48.352
- Whatever stories you have...
- Not stories. Truths.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.352
About her, and about Reddington.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.112
I'm not helping you escape.

06:55.920 --> 06:56.956
I know.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.599
You just don't see it.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.079
Alexander?

07:07.520 --> 07:10.718
That you've helped already.

07:12.720 --> 07:16.191
- More than you could ever possibly...
- Kirk?

07:17.680 --> 07:20.036
Enter the code.
Open the door right now.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.000
He's not breathing.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.640
Get a medic in here now.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.000
We'll be taking the whole wing.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.391
Everyone in and out
will get a full body scan.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.472
- This guy's that important?
- He is to us.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.359
Your prisoner's in the end stages...

07:47.520 --> 07:49.591
- ...of aplastic anemia.
- What does that mean?

07:49.760 --> 07:55.199
An average person has between 150 to
400,000 platelets per microliter of blood.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.591
Mr. Kirk's is under 10,000.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.594
I'd expect to see
intracranial bleeding within hours.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.995
Treatment?

08:02.160 --> 08:04.436
He's been receiving
transfusions for many years.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.514
If I give him another at this point,
he's liable to suffer autoimmune shock.

08:08.680 --> 08:09.955
And if you don't?

08:10.120 --> 08:11.474
He bleeds to death.

08:11.640 --> 08:15.316
Once we get the test results back,
I'll formulate a treatment plan.

08:15.480 --> 08:19.679
But my guess is
all this firepower is wasted.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.070
How's that?

08:22.200 --> 08:27.150
Unless he has a blood relative willing to
donate stem cells his body won't reject...

08:27.360 --> 08:29.591
...your prisoner will be dead
by morning.

08:34.679 --> 08:38.390
Kirk is being held under guard
in a U.S. Army Hospital in Bethesda.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.837
I want a full workup of all medical
requirements for his transport...

08:42.039 --> 08:44.953
...and a list of potential destinations,
both overt and covert.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.789
Get me a breakdown on
the legalities of extradition.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.198
And find me an airfield in close proximity
that will take his jet...

08:51.360 --> 08:54.512
...preferably one on an international
flight path into Dulles.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.679
- Don't we get him out of the hospital first?
- Leave that to me.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.794
Renata's been tutoring our students
in Latin for a decade.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.474
She's an inspiration.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.314
Somehow makes a dead language
come alive.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.116
You wanted to see me?

09:13.320 --> 09:16.950
Yes. These are Agents Ressler
and Navabi from the FBI.

09:17.160 --> 09:21.074
- Can we see some identification, please?
- Yes, of course.

09:21.720 --> 09:22.836
Something wrong?

09:23.040 --> 09:25.714
So how long have you been
in the country for?

09:26.520 --> 09:28.591
Eleven years.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.832
- I don't understand. What's going on?
- That's a nice tattoo.

09:33.960 --> 09:37.078
Where I come from,
a tattoo is a dream made flesh.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.438
- A rose is a sign of beauty.
- Except when laid on a grave.

09:51.920 --> 09:52.910
Over here.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.749
Pass it to me.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.310
Hey!

10:07.240 --> 10:08.560
Everyone, behind me.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.755
You're not supposed to have guns
in school.

10:21.440 --> 10:26.595
Santa Muerte? I hear the Mexican cartels
pray to her for protection.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.038
Can I have my shirt back now?

10:29.200 --> 10:32.557
Your DNA is going to come back
ID'ing you as Giza Barrera.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.840
I don't know who that is.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.515
But I bet you know
who Alejandro Medina is.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.310
See, we know that you killed his father
when you took over his cartel.

10:41.480 --> 10:44.951
I wonder what kind of tattoo he'll give you
when he finds out you're alive.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.038
I don't know who that is.

10:50.280 --> 10:54.433
You were 14 when your father married you
to a man 40 years older than you.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.115
I can't imagine what that was like.

10:57.680 --> 11:02.391
Fathers are supposed to
protect their daughters. Yours didn't.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.074
But we can, if you tell us
how to contact The Coroner.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.320
<i>Every week, there's an ad
in the Lexington Herald...</i>

11:17.640 --> 11:19.074
<i>...asking for volunteers for a blood drive.</i>

11:19.280 --> 11:21.920
Tell them you're a phlebotomist
with Cardinal Hill.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.959
<i>You'll get a text with the time and place
for the next drive.</i>

11:25.240 --> 11:30.031
They'll take prints, DNA swabs, anything
needed to verify you're not a cop.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.960
<i>Before he turns you
into someone new...</i>

11:33.120 --> 11:35.954
...The Coroner likes to know
who you've been.

11:37.320 --> 11:41.519
Wait, wait, wait. Won't your fingerprints
and DNA ID you as an agent of the FBI?

11:41.720 --> 11:44.519
No, they'll ID an alias the Mossad set up
before I joined the task force.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.757
Hello? Yes, it is.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.592
I understand.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.159
Dinner at Isobel's.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.720
Clinch, party of two.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.119
I'm in.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.873
<i>- How's Agnes?
- She's fine. Screaming.</i>

12:12.080 --> 12:16.438
I know we're supposed to let her cry,
but talk about cruel and unusual.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.195
She missed you tonight.
I thought you'd be home earlier.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.511
I know, I'm sorry I didn't call.

12:21.680 --> 12:25.196
<i>- Kirk collapsed in the Post Office.
- Well, that's good.</i>

12:25.360 --> 12:29.400
His only hope is for a blood relative
to donate stem cells.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.512
- And you're thinking about it?
- I just wanted to talk to you about it.

12:33.680 --> 12:34.955
<i>What is there to talk about?</i>

12:35.120 --> 12:38.955
He attacked our wedding, kidnapped you
and said he'd throw our child from a roof.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.670
For that, he'll spend his life in prison.
I'm not talking about freeing him.

12:42.840 --> 12:45.560
- I'm talking about saving his life.
- Why would you do that?

12:45.800 --> 12:48.793
- Because he's my father.
- No, he's a stranger.

12:48.960 --> 12:49.996
<i>It's not that simple.</i>

12:50.200 --> 12:52.590
<i>- It is that simple.
- What if it were your father?</i>

12:52.760 --> 12:55.639
What if you suddenly found him?
Would you be able to walk away?

12:56.960 --> 12:59.429
- Yeah.
- I don't believe that for a second.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.593
You should, because I did.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.679
From my mother.
I met her while you were in Cuba.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.078
Wait, wait, wait. You met your mother?

13:08.240 --> 13:11.756
<i>- Yeah. Her name's Susan Hargrave.
- Why didn't you tell me?</i>

13:11.920 --> 13:15.152
I was gonna tell you
when things settled down, but...

13:15.320 --> 13:17.232
- ...they never did.
- How did it happen?

13:17.440 --> 13:19.511
What was she like?
You must have a million questions.

13:19.680 --> 13:24.357
I do. That's my point. I'm letting questions
go unanswered. I think you should too.

13:24.520 --> 13:28.196
You met your mother, whom you've never
known, and you were able to just...

13:28.360 --> 13:29.350
...walk away?

13:29.520 --> 13:33.992
Yeah, from someone who abandoned me
and has nothing to do with who I am.

13:34.760 --> 13:38.231
<i>Same as Kirk. Your father, my mother,
they're part of our past.</i>

13:38.520 --> 13:40.432
But you're my future.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.117
Liz, that's all I'm interested in.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.112
<i>And I think it's what you should be
interested in too.</i>

13:53.200 --> 13:54.714
Thank you.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.638
Listen up, boys. This is him.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.552
No wonder they call him The Coroner.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.479
<i>Our teams are in place.</i>

14:17.680 --> 14:19.637
Thank you for agreeing to meet.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.915
Would you like me to start by explaining
my situation?

14:23.080 --> 14:25.197
Your name is Victoria Cronin.

14:25.360 --> 14:29.070
You have a master's in health care
administration from Smith College.

14:29.240 --> 14:33.678
So Rory says, "In Boston, a shot
of whiskey in a pint of stout...

14:33.840 --> 14:39.199
...is an Irish car bomb.
In Belfast, it's breakfast."

14:41.760 --> 14:43.956
- Excuse me.
- What the hell is he doing here?

14:47.080 --> 14:49.117
You must be The Coroner.

14:49.320 --> 14:53.439
- Were you followed?
- Samar, darling, please.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.751
Save it for Mossad summer theater.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.800
I used her to lure you here.
She doesn't need an identity. I do.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.835
You are Raymond Reddington.

15:02.040 --> 15:05.397
And you're on the wrong side of 80,
sitting on a donut pillow.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.475
My sympathies
to your significant other.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.474
And if your flag is flying at half-mast...

15:11.680 --> 15:15.674
...rest assured,
I find, in the privacy of one's boudoir...

15:15.840 --> 15:19.117
...pleasing others is the key
to pleasing oneself.

15:19.280 --> 15:22.034
Do you expect me
to make you disappear?

15:22.200 --> 15:26.433
I've been disappearing for over 25 years,
I don't need your help to disappear.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.200
<i>I need an identity.</i>

15:28.400 --> 15:31.837
Specifically, the one
you created for Sonia Bloom.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.719
The research scientist.

15:33.880 --> 15:38.909
Fifteen years ago, she arrived in her
lab to find her life's work stolen...

15:39.120 --> 15:42.113
...and her partner dead
of an apparent suicide...

15:42.280 --> 15:44.715
...except it wasn't suicide,
and she knew it.

15:44.920 --> 15:49.233
Fearing for her life, she contacted you
and became someone else.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.959
I need to know who.

15:51.120 --> 15:55.797
That's impossible. My clients
expect absolute confidentiality.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.677
Few things in life are truly impossible.

16:00.240 --> 16:04.632
Talking an Irishman out of vengeance
for his brother's death is one of them.

16:04.800 --> 16:09.158
You see that ruddy-faced fellow
in my booth? Willie Adair.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.875
Back home,
they call him "Barking Mad Willie."

16:12.040 --> 16:16.239
He has this pack of
absolutely voracious wolfhounds.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.756
I don't know who that is.

16:18.920 --> 16:22.231
But you gave the man
who killed his brother a new identity.

16:22.560 --> 16:27.157
Perhaps I should call him over so you
can explain your policy on confidentiality.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.120
That won't be necessary.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.913
Sonia Bloom.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.991
Adrian Shaw.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.919
Cheers.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.234
What the hell was that all about?

16:47.440 --> 16:50.672
- Who's Sonia Bloom?
- Apparently, Adrian Shaw.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.309
- You didn't care about The Coroner.
- No, I didn't.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.678
You used us to find him for you
so he could tell you about Bloom.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.674
I don't know what the two of you
are so indignant about.

16:59.840 --> 17:04.198
I told you about a criminal you had no idea
existed, and now he's in your custody.

17:04.359 --> 17:07.397
The Coroner gives you
dozens of criminals...

17:07.560 --> 17:10.280
...you thought were dead or missing.

17:10.599 --> 17:13.559
Take the win, Donald.
You could use one.

17:20.280 --> 17:24.069
I don't care who we have to reach out to.
ICE, DEA, CIA, NSA.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.878
Any of them, all of them.

17:26.040 --> 17:30.080
We're gonna find Sonia Bloom and figure
out what Reddington wants with her.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.751
- Colonel Wright?
- It's gonna have to wait.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.559
- What happened?
- Freeway accident.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.951
Multiple trauma victims,
more on their way.

17:38.160 --> 17:42.120
- What did you need to discuss?
- I'm Alexander Kirk's daughter.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.555
- Why didn't you say so?
- I wasn't sure I wanted to help.

17:45.720 --> 17:49.475
- And now you are?
- If I am, what do I need to do?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.399
Harvest stem cells?

17:55.560 --> 17:57.677
It sounds worse than it is.

17:57.840 --> 17:58.956
I certainly hope so.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.840
They put me on dialysis
and collect the cells...

18:02.000 --> 18:04.560
...and if they get enough,
they transfuse them to Kirk.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.714
And that would save him?

18:06.880 --> 18:10.157
- It could, if we're compatible.
- You're his daughter.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.916
Apparently, that's no guarantee.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.311
They test for 16 genetic markers...

18:15.480 --> 18:19.030
...and that's after they check to see that
our blood types are a match.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.109
Reddington said I'd save him.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.714
Tom will never forgive me if I do.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.555
Kirk hurt the two people Tom loves.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.792
You can't be surprised if
he doesn't want you to help him.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.710
What do you think I should do?

18:40.200 --> 18:44.956
Doesn't matter what I think.
Or Reddington. Or Tom, for that matter.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.318
None of us can possibly know
how it feels to be in your position.

18:48.520 --> 18:51.638
And none of us have to live with
the consequences of your decision.

18:52.160 --> 18:56.074
All I will say is this.
Given what he's done...

18:56.760 --> 18:58.717
...no one would fault you
for walking away.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.400
Maybe not.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.356
But I'm afraid I would.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.350
I found the teacup.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.189
Oh, and the banana.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.996
That's 11. One more.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.197
Don't tell me.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.435
The doctor will see you now.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.519
Raymond.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.433
One second.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.592
- The sailboat.
- Oh, why'd you...?

19:40.280 --> 19:42.112
Show-off.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.720
<i>Mr. Reddington's a genius.</i>

19:43.880 --> 19:46.349
Could be an evil genius, but still.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.194
- Found his connection to Sonia Bloom?
- Yes.

19:49.360 --> 19:52.194
Sonia Bloom worked on next-gen
genome research...

19:52.360 --> 19:55.637
...resequencing DNA
to help the body fight off disease.

19:55.840 --> 19:58.355
In 2001, she and her partner applied
for a patent.

19:58.520 --> 20:01.558
A week later, her partner was murdered,
and she went underground.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.673
- We already knew that.
- Yeah, but you didn't know this.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.280
Her partner was Matthew Hadj.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.114
One of the inventors murdered
by the Lindquist Concern.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.636
Reddington gave us that case
to get to the partner.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.271
Then when he couldn't, when he found
out Sonia Bloom had disappeared...

20:16.480 --> 20:18.517
...he gave us The Coroner to find her.

20:18.680 --> 20:21.275
So, what is it about her research
that connects to Kirk?

20:21.440 --> 20:23.796
Okay. Sonia Bloom is hiding
as Adrian Shaw.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.394
What we know of The Coroner...

20:25.560 --> 20:29.395
...it's safe to assume that almost every
personal detail about her life is false.

20:29.560 --> 20:32.394
The only detail we know to be true
is that she's a doctor.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.994
Was then, is now.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.914
And while I can't connect
her past research to Kirk...

20:37.080 --> 20:39.037
...current AMA records indicate
that now...

20:39.200 --> 20:42.955
...as Shaw, she has a new partner
who specializes in...

20:43.120 --> 20:44.520
Wait for it.

20:46.560 --> 20:47.596
...Hematology.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.319
So Kirk's dying of anemia...

20:49.480 --> 20:52.473
...and Reddington's looking for
a mysterious blood doctor...

20:52.640 --> 20:54.871
...who's doing research
into gene sequencing.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.509
Dr. Shaw may be Kirk's last hope
for finding a cure.

20:57.680 --> 20:58.909
Reddington wants Kirk dead.

20:59.080 --> 21:02.756
One way of guaranteeing that is to kill
the one doctor able to keep him alive.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.912
The partner.
What's the new partner's name?

21:06.960 --> 21:08.189
Thank you.

21:08.360 --> 21:11.592
Dr. Rayburn, thank you for seeing me
without an appointment.

21:11.760 --> 21:15.959
- What seems to be the trouble?
- I have a pain right here.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.396
We don't keep drugs in the office.

21:22.560 --> 21:26.554
If I want narcotics, doctor, I'll call the
guy with the briefcase like everybody else.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.999
I'm looking for Dr. Adrian Shaw.

21:30.760 --> 21:34.276
- Units are rolling to Rayburn's clinic now.
- Who owns it? Is it incorporated?

21:34.480 --> 21:37.951
Looks like the clinic is owned by
an LLC based in Delaware.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.999
If the research Reddington's after
is worth killing over...

21:41.160 --> 21:42.674
...it's not done at a clinic.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.514
- What else does the LLC own?
- Checking, hang on.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.400
A warehouse, a building,
somewhere no one would look.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.514
- What is it? Did you find something?
- Yeah.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.354
And it's definitely not somewhere
anyone would look.

21:57.520 --> 22:01.309
Mr. Fox, might I remind you of the
condition you were in when you arrived?

22:01.480 --> 22:05.360
I'm dying, not poor.
I won't live like this. I'm leaving.

22:05.520 --> 22:09.958
You were dying, but based on treatment,
you've shown remarkable progress.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.079
I haven't been outside for two weeks.

22:13.240 --> 22:16.312
You signed up for me to save your life,
and that is what I'm doing.

22:16.520 --> 22:21.436
For you and the former patients who lead
healthy lives because of this program.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.751
You mean the ones whose skin
hasn't melted off?

22:24.360 --> 22:29.799
I know what's happening.
Blake. Zion. Kearney. Oates.

22:29.960 --> 22:34.273
- This trial is a death sentence.
- What we're doing is illegal, not immoral.

22:34.440 --> 22:38.400
- You came aboard, you knew the risks.
- If I say I'm leaving, sweetheart...

22:38.560 --> 22:39.550
...pack my bags.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.071
If you won't honor your commitment
to the trial...

22:43.240 --> 22:45.880
...how can I rely on your commitment
to confidentiality?

22:46.040 --> 22:50.557
I agreed to keep quiet about science,
not murder.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.831
There's simply nowhere for you to go.

23:19.760 --> 23:20.910
How you feeling?

23:21.080 --> 23:24.630
Great. I'm going to die, but I feel great.

23:26.400 --> 23:27.914
What would you do...

23:28.600 --> 23:32.480
...if you had more money
than you could ever spend?

23:35.440 --> 23:39.229
Travel the world with my family. Twice.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.517
You could get away from him.

23:41.680 --> 23:43.592
Somewhere safe
where he couldn't find you.

23:44.520 --> 23:47.115
Sure. But like my dad always said:

23:47.320 --> 23:50.518
"If wishes were horses,
beggars would ride."

23:50.840 --> 23:54.390
My adopted dad. Sam Milhoan.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.397
My entire life...

23:57.560 --> 24:00.234
...all I ever wanted
was to make you safe.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.278
Protect you.

24:02.640 --> 24:06.316
And in the end, the only way
I'm able to do that is by dying.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.677
- I don't understand.
- It's yours.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.232
Everything I have.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.437
I'm leaving you my fortune.

24:14.640 --> 24:18.156
Which you'll have plenty of time
to spend, because you're not dying.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.553
Not now, anyway.

24:20.720 --> 24:24.316
I told your doctor that I decided
to be your donor.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.515
They're running the tests now
to confirm we're a match.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.716
Why did you decide to help me?

24:40.120 --> 24:42.510
Because you didn't ask.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.479
Your lawyer's here to see you.

24:47.640 --> 24:50.633
If I could have a moment alone
with my client.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.560
Of course. For now.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.509
Out, but not cured.

25:04.680 --> 25:05.909
Only she can do that.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.153
An FBI agent and a lifesaver.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.352
You must be so proud.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.432
She's agreed to be my donor.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.400
I need a day, maybe two.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.991
And I need you to watch your mouth.

25:25.840 --> 25:30.471
We had everything before her.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.472
And now look at us.

25:32.640 --> 25:37.271
I am not apologizing for disliking her.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.834
The extraction plan is in place.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.636
We move on your signal.

25:56.040 --> 25:58.475
<i>We're told dozens were injured
in this bus accident...</i>

26:00.640 --> 26:03.360
<i>...and they've been transferred to
Walter Reed facility...</i>

26:11.280 --> 26:13.840
Excuse me,
I'm here to see Elizabeth Keen.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.469
- She was on the bus?
- What bus?

26:16.640 --> 26:18.393
The accident. Is she a patient?

26:18.560 --> 26:22.952
No, she's visiting a family member.
Alexander Kirk. He's in a locked ward.

26:23.120 --> 26:26.158
- You say her name is Elizabeth Keen?
- That's right. She's my wife.

26:26.320 --> 26:29.552
Sir, your wife is a patient.
She was admitted an hour ago.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.760
Admitted for what?

26:42.840 --> 26:43.990
Don't say it.

26:45.040 --> 26:46.997
What is there to say?

26:47.160 --> 26:50.358
- I gave you my opinion, you ignored it.
- I didn't ignore it, I just...

26:51.520 --> 26:52.715
...didn't agree.

26:53.560 --> 26:54.789
Okay, what are the risks?

26:55.080 --> 26:59.199
- Risks? For me, none.
- None? Are you sure?

26:59.360 --> 27:01.477
All I have to do is give blood.

27:02.680 --> 27:04.751
I should have told you sooner, I'm sorry.

27:04.920 --> 27:07.754
Just... Everything is happening so fast.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.872
I get it. Fine.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.600
Help him if you have to...

27:12.760 --> 27:16.117
...but promise me you're not gonna
hurt yourself in the process.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.637
I promise.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.193
Harbor Patrol and Customs
will meet you on site.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.476
<i>What's the ETA?</i>

27:22.640 --> 27:25.280
Red Hook harbor master
has the ship docking in 45 minutes.

27:25.440 --> 27:26.476
Is there a manifest?

27:26.640 --> 27:29.030
Yeah, I e-mailed it to you.
Sixteen crew members...

27:29.200 --> 27:31.396
...and the licensed cargo
is medical equipment.

27:32.160 --> 27:34.117
- How convenient.
- Not just any equipment.

27:34.280 --> 27:37.512
Thermal cyclers,
centrifuges, incubators.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.956
Yeah, these are products
used in genome research.

27:40.480 --> 27:44.952
Thanks. That was the unit I dispatched
to get Dr. Rayburn. He left an hour ago...

27:45.120 --> 27:50.195
...accompanied by a large black man
and a middle-aged white guy. In a hat.

27:51.720 --> 27:54.189
We're about to dock.
What's the emergency?

27:54.400 --> 27:57.552
<i>Dr. Shaw.
Or should I call you Dr. Bloom?</i>

27:58.280 --> 28:00.920
Either way, I'll skip the pleasantries.
We haven't much time.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.152
- Who is this?
- I'm with your colleague, Dr. Rayburn...

28:04.320 --> 28:07.074
...who can confirm we have a situation.
As we speak...

28:07.240 --> 28:09.550
<i>...the FBI is raiding his medical clinic.</i>

28:09.720 --> 28:14.954
Sonia, he knows everything.
About the research, The Coroner.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.352
I'm like the ghost of Christmas past.
And future.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.355
Which is how I know the FBI
will board your ship the moment it docks.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.513
Whoever you are,
why should I believe you?

28:25.720 --> 28:28.394
Belief is such a relative concept.

28:28.600 --> 28:29.795
Is there a God?

28:30.200 --> 28:31.793
<i>Are we alone in the universe?</i>

28:31.960 --> 28:35.112
What the hell have they found out there
in Area 51 anyway?

28:35.280 --> 28:39.672
I prefer to think of your decision
as judicious risk assessment.

28:39.840 --> 28:43.311
I have considerable resources
to put at your disposal.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.358
<i>I'm here to help you, Dr. Shaw.</i>

28:45.520 --> 28:48.957
<i>If you don't want to go to jail,
listen to me carefully.</i>

28:49.160 --> 28:52.232
Firstly, is there a helipad on your ship?

28:57.760 --> 29:00.150
- We got your results back.
- How'd I do?

29:00.320 --> 29:04.030
We couldn't harvest enough stem cells
to justify a transfusion.

29:04.840 --> 29:05.990
So, what happens now?

29:06.160 --> 29:09.790
With a compatible donor,
we could do a surgical procedure...

29:09.960 --> 29:12.839
...to harvest marrow directly
from the cavity of your hipbone.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.391
No. A surgical procedure carries risks,
right? For Liz?

29:16.560 --> 29:18.438
While it's a minor procedure...

29:18.600 --> 29:21.479
...an infection could cause
necrosis of the hip...

29:21.640 --> 29:23.313
...which could impact mobility...

29:23.600 --> 29:27.389
...or a fat embolism
that could affect multiple organ systems.

29:27.560 --> 29:30.951
- And if those are risks I'm willing to take?
- Which you're not.

29:31.160 --> 29:35.074
What risks you are or are not
willing to take are irrelevant.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.436
Even if the dialysis had worked...

29:37.600 --> 29:41.719
...the hospital won't transfuse
your stem cells into Mr. Kirk...

29:41.920 --> 29:46.711
...unless and until we receive
confirmation that you're a genetic match.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.156
You sent my blood out for testing
hours ago.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.913
You know about the bus accident.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.800
You saw the incoming.
The system is overwhelmed.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.794
And if he dies before the tests
come confirming I'm a match?

29:56.960 --> 29:59.520
I understand you feel
he has nothing to lose...

29:59.680 --> 30:01.911
...but that is not how we make
hospital policy.

30:02.080 --> 30:06.871
The tests could come back five minutes
late. Two. You're okay with that?

30:07.040 --> 30:09.236
Of course not. I made it clear...

30:09.400 --> 30:12.359
...your blood work should be
the lab's top priority.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.240
They'll get your results
as fast as possible...

30:15.400 --> 30:18.552
...and I'll be in touch
as soon as they do.

30:32.640 --> 30:37.317
- Special Agent Ressler, Navabi, FBI.
- Is there a problem?

30:37.520 --> 30:40.194
There won't be if you direct us
to Dr. Adrian Shaw.

30:40.400 --> 30:41.800
I don't know who that is.

30:41.960 --> 30:45.351
Maybe a warrant to board your ship
will jog your memory.

30:45.520 --> 30:48.718
- There's no Adrian Shaw on this ship.
- We'll see about that.

31:00.120 --> 31:03.830
He's gonna die because a bus accident
delayed some lab work...

31:04.000 --> 31:06.595
...and answers I'm looking for
are gonna die with him.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.520
Some answers about who you were...

31:10.280 --> 31:12.078
...but none about who you are...

31:12.240 --> 31:14.232
...or who you will be.

31:16.640 --> 31:20.270
Certainly none that affect your happiness,
which is all I care about.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.871
- Miss Keen, come with me, please.
- Do you have the lab results?

31:24.040 --> 31:26.157
Dr. Wright should have them
in a few minutes.

31:26.360 --> 31:30.832
I've been instructed to prep you for surgery
in anticipation of a positive result.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.237
I know I'm breaking my promise...

31:34.880 --> 31:36.473
...but I have to do this.

31:36.640 --> 31:39.474
You want to. There's a difference.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.950
Searched the entire ship,
no sign of Dr. Shaw.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.952
I told you, this isn't a passenger ship.

31:57.120 --> 31:59.635
- There is no Dr. Shaw.
- I know you're hiding something.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.792
You searched the ship,
delayed my offload.

32:01.960 --> 32:05.840
I got six tons of cargo, signed, sealed and
inspected, so if there's nothing else...

32:06.160 --> 32:07.833
Ressler.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.193
Does this look odd to you?

32:27.840 --> 32:29.069
Arrest him.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.594
Where does this lead?

34:26.760 --> 34:28.159
Yes.

34:30.760 --> 34:32.911
That was the lab,
they've got the results.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.398
- You okay?
- Yeah.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.315
What the hell is this place?

35:09.720 --> 35:12.076
I thought you were in surgery.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.119
I was.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.911
You just saved my life.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.232
I tried to.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.196
You weren't a match?

35:31.480 --> 35:32.914
No.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.236
- Well, you did what you could.
- The test results...

35:40.400 --> 35:43.154
- No, just forget about them.
- You don't understand.

35:43.320 --> 35:47.314
Yes, we weren't compatible.
Not every father and daughter are.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.997
It's not just that we weren't compatible.

35:55.360 --> 35:58.512
The test results
showed something else.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.356
I'm not your daughter.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.111
- How did the FBI find us?
- I don't know.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.273
What matters is Reddington
was able to chopper you off the ship.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.240
What does he want?
Why are we here?

36:32.400 --> 36:34.357
Agent Navabi.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.270
<i>- Yes.
- We know what you're doing.</i>

36:38.440 --> 36:40.079
I sincerely doubt that.

36:40.240 --> 36:44.393
<i>- Dr. Adrian Shaw. You abducted her.
- I kept her from you, there's a difference.</i>

36:44.560 --> 36:47.075
We would have arrested her.
You're going to kill her.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.232
You looked absolutely ravishing...

36:49.400 --> 36:51.232
- ...the other night.
- We've seen her research.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.790
<i>What do you do
to stay in such incredible shape?</i>

36:53.960 --> 36:56.077
Calisthenics, or Jazzercise?

36:56.240 --> 36:59.597
The gene-sequencing technology
she's trying to perfect is called CRISPR.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.036
It's supposed to teach your DNA
to repair itself.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.959
Maybe we should be workout partners.

37:04.120 --> 37:06.396
<i>Adrian Shaw was using
human experimentation...</i>

37:06.560 --> 37:08.472
...to cure people like Alexander Kirk.

37:08.640 --> 37:12.031
He either financed her research,
or wanted to use it to cure himself.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.680
<i>So, you got to her first.</i>

37:13.840 --> 37:17.356
Adrian Shaw deserves to go to prison
for what she's done, not be murdered.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.398
I'll see you in dance class, Samar.

37:20.640 --> 37:23.200
Hello? Hello?

37:23.360 --> 37:27.957
He knows everything.
I don't know how, but he does.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.918
About you being Sonia Bloom...

37:30.080 --> 37:32.720
...going on the run
after Matthew was murdered.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.837
He found Matthew's killer.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.276
He avenged his death
after all these years.

37:37.760 --> 37:40.070
- Why would he do that?
- Dr. Shaw.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.993
Fresh off the boat, as it were.

37:42.680 --> 37:44.956
Dr. Rayburn, I'm sure
someone is sick somewhere...

37:45.120 --> 37:46.679
...who could use your assistance.

37:47.240 --> 37:49.755
- What?
- Goodbye.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.674
Please.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.239
You're Raymond Reddington.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.993
And you're in my debt...

37:59.160 --> 38:01.720
...which can be
a complicated place to be.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.073
Shall we?

38:09.960 --> 38:13.032
It doesn't make any sense.
I saw the DNA test.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.590
Thirty years ago. Clearly, it was flawed.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.353
And the things he knows about me?

38:17.560 --> 38:19.392
He wasn't pretending.

38:19.560 --> 38:23.839
He believed he was my father.
So did I.

38:24.080 --> 38:28.711
I didn't want you to do it in the first
place. But I admire you for wanting to.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.837
And this whole time,
Reddington was right.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.754
No, he was wrong about one thing.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.840
Kirk is never getting out of here alive.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.557
We just got the sign.

39:15.280 --> 39:17.556
All teams ready, we move in five.

39:48.440 --> 39:51.274
- What is this?
- This was a thriving business...

39:51.440 --> 39:54.512
...that manufactured
counterfeit cigarette tax stamps...

39:54.680 --> 39:57.240
...until a little over two weeks ago.

39:57.400 --> 40:01.235
There's a hefty profit in tax stamps, and
they're a lovely way to launder money.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.278
A story I can share another time.

40:03.440 --> 40:07.559
Right now I have a pressing matter,
which requires your assistance.

40:08.360 --> 40:09.396
Are you sick?

40:10.480 --> 40:12.915
You have no idea.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.320
What are you doing?

40:22.880 --> 40:24.678
Well, I came here for treatment.

40:24.920 --> 40:27.355
Now, since I'm not getting any...

40:27.520 --> 40:29.751
You'd rather go back to the box?

40:29.920 --> 40:33.231
- They can make you comfortable here.
- That DNA test was altered.

40:33.680 --> 40:36.991
- I thought it was a mistake too.
- Mistake? It wasn't a mistake. No.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.750
- It was altered. By Reddington.
- I had the lab re-run the test.

40:40.920 --> 40:42.434
It came back the same way.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.752
Yes, to make it look like
you're not my daughter.

40:45.960 --> 40:49.112
He knew you'd want to save me,
so he did everything in his power...

40:49.280 --> 40:52.591
...to prevent that. But he's not going
to prevent it, do you hear me?

40:52.800 --> 40:54.280
I will not die in here.

40:54.440 --> 40:56.238
You are going to save me, Masha.

40:56.400 --> 40:58.790
You're going to save me, Masha.

40:59.240 --> 41:01.038
- Save me, Masha.
- Give me a hand.

41:03.840 --> 41:05.957
- Yes.
- Did you manipulate the test?

41:06.280 --> 41:09.114
<i>- What are you talking about?
- I just showed Kirk DNA proof...</i>

41:09.320 --> 41:11.960
...he's not my father,
and he blames you for faking the test.

41:12.120 --> 41:14.237
- Get out of the hospital.
- Don't change the subject.

41:14.400 --> 41:17.279
The only subject that interests me,
Elizabeth, is your safety.

41:17.440 --> 41:19.113
A safety guaranteed thus far...

41:19.280 --> 41:21.920
...because Alexander Kirk believed you
to be his daughter.

41:22.120 --> 41:23.395
He now knows you're not.

41:24.640 --> 41:29.510
He's under federal guard. Marshals at
every entrance. What's he gonna do?

41:29.680 --> 41:33.117
I'll tell you what he won't do.
He won't die alone in that hospital.

41:33.280 --> 41:35.920
<i>I promise you,
the plan is already in motion.</i>

41:37.560 --> 41:41.190
<i>All of Kirk's resources
will be brought to bear.</i>

41:41.600 --> 41:43.751
<i>Every angle has been calculated...</i>

41:43.920 --> 41:46.833
<i>...every obstacle considered
and accounted for.</i>

41:47.000 --> 41:49.117
<i>Men are coming, Elizabeth.</i>

41:49.280 --> 41:52.876
Men who kill every living thing
that gets in their way.

41:53.040 --> 41:56.238
Tell Harold,
and then you get out of that hospital.

42:19.240 --> 42:21.072
We're in place. On your ready.
