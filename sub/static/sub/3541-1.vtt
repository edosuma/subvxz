<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.086 --> 00:06.647
For over a century,
I have lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.823 --> 00:08.791
I know the risk, but I have to know her.

00:08.958 --> 00:10.425
- I'm Elena.
- I'm Stefan.

00:10.593 --> 00:12.891
- What are you?
- I'm a vampire.

00:13.063 --> 00:15.088
- Why are you here?
- I miss my brother.

00:15.265 --> 00:18.257
He told me about your ex, Katherine.
She broke your heart.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.697
That was a long time ago.

00:19.869 --> 00:21.063
Why do I look like her?

00:21.237 --> 00:23.603
Our love for Katherine, it wasn't real.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.333
Katherine never compelled me.
It was real for me.

00:26.576 --> 00:29.602
- Are you psychic or clairvoyant?
- Technically, I'm a witch.

00:30.613 --> 00:32.478
- That noise.
- What noise?

00:33.883 --> 00:35.282
Tyler!

00:38.755 --> 00:39.915
What the hell?

00:41.458 --> 00:43.119
- We need help here.
- Caroline.

00:43.326 --> 00:44.588
You talked to your mom?

00:44.761 --> 00:48.162
- What is it?
- It's your dad. He's dead.

00:48.331 --> 00:52.597
You decided that I was worth saving.
I wanted to thank you...

00:53.036 --> 00:54.799
...for that.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.840
- Anna.
- Here. It's my blood.

01:02.112 --> 01:05.479
- Die with it in you, you'll come back.
- Anna's dead. I saw her killed.

01:05.648 --> 01:08.310
- I know you cared about her.
- Yeah, I did.

01:23.366 --> 01:24.458
You scared me.

01:24.768 --> 01:26.531
Sorry.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.366
- Is Jenna home?
- She had to meet the fire chief.

01:30.540 --> 01:33.202
She doesn't know the truth.
They've covered it up.

01:33.376 --> 01:34.707
Yeah, I know.

01:34.878 --> 01:36.778
How's Jeremy?

01:38.148 --> 01:39.479
Holed up in his room.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.115
I looked everywhere.

01:48.291 --> 01:50.156
<i>You think someone stole it?</i>

01:50.326 --> 01:52.851
Someone took my stuff.

01:53.029 --> 01:56.590
- Can I help?
- Sure.

01:56.766 --> 01:57.960
<i>Want me to pick you up?</i>

01:58.134 --> 02:00.159
I gotta check on Jeremy
before I go to the hospital.

02:00.336 --> 02:02.361
- Can you meet me there?
- <i>You bet.</i>

02:02.539 --> 02:03.597
Okay.

02:03.807 --> 02:05.798
- I love you, Stefan.
- <i>I love you too.</i>

02:09.846 --> 02:11.336
Katherine?

02:11.514 --> 02:13.607
Hello, John. Goodbye, John.

02:19.856 --> 02:22.222
Jeremy? Are you up?

02:46.049 --> 02:47.880
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

02:48.051 --> 02:50.747
Hi, I need an ambulance
to 2104 Maple Street.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.353
Behind you.

02:52.522 --> 02:54.547
- What?
- Behind you.

03:30.660 --> 03:32.457
Jeremy.

03:33.529 --> 03:35.997
Jeremy! Jeremy.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.465
- Please, Jeremy, wake up.
- Ah!

03:54.684 --> 03:56.311
He's okay.

04:02.125 --> 04:03.524
What happened?

04:03.693 --> 04:06.457
He said Anna gave him her blood,
then he took these pills.

04:06.629 --> 04:09.462
And now... I mean, he looks fine,
but then again, so do you.

04:09.632 --> 04:11.759
- So l... I don't know.
- Come here. Look at me.

04:11.935 --> 04:13.698
No, I'm fine. I feel exactly the same.

04:13.870 --> 04:15.861
Should I call a paramedic?
What should I do?

04:16.471 --> 04:18.201
No.

04:18.975 --> 04:20.636
He's fine.

04:20.810 --> 04:22.505
You mean, I'm not a vampire?

04:23.880 --> 04:24.972
Damn it.

04:25.982 --> 04:29.042
Don't say that, Jeremy.
Jeremy, why would you want that?

04:30.219 --> 04:33.552
Did you hear about Anna?
What happened to her tonight?

04:34.657 --> 04:35.988
She's dead.

04:36.159 --> 04:38.389
Jeremy. Jeremy, come here. Sit down.

04:38.561 --> 04:42.588
I am very sorry about Anna, but it's very
important that you listen to me.

04:42.765 --> 04:44.858
Anna's blood is leaving your system.

04:45.034 --> 04:48.060
If you tried to kill yourself right now,
you could really die.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.233
- Hey. Do you understand me?
- Stefan.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.674
Yeah, I understand.

04:56.612 --> 04:58.102
Good.

05:03.086 --> 05:04.678
What about the pills he took?

05:04.854 --> 05:08.551
He didn't take enough to die, so Anna's
blood actually healed him of that.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.085
- Miss Gilbert?
- I'll be right there.

05:13.262 --> 05:15.093
- You need to be at the hospital.
- But...

05:15.264 --> 05:18.062
No, no. I'll stay here with Jeremy.

05:18.234 --> 05:20.031
No, I don't need a babysitter.

05:20.770 --> 05:22.795
Yes, you do.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.378
How's Caroline?

05:29.545 --> 05:30.807
She's not good, Bon.

05:31.014 --> 05:33.005
What happened?

05:33.182 --> 05:36.208
We were driving
and Tyler heard this noise and he got...

05:36.386 --> 05:39.378
- A noise?
- He got, like, this migraine or something...

05:39.555 --> 05:42.752
...and he lost control of the car and l...

05:42.925 --> 05:45.951
I thought that Caroline was fine,
and then...

05:46.129 --> 05:49.292
And then she wasn't, so...

05:50.666 --> 05:52.099
Liz.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.600
I came as soon as I got the message.
Is she okay?

05:54.771 --> 05:58.935
She's in surgery. It's...
They're doing everything they can.

06:00.676 --> 06:04.043
- I need your help, Damon.
- Sure. Anything, Liz.

06:05.548 --> 06:07.573
Mayor Lockwood is dead.

06:07.750 --> 06:10.617
They thought he was a vampire.
They put him in the basement.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.982
- Mayor Lockwood was a vampire?
- No, no, no. A mistake was made.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.786
They said he dropped liked the others
when John's device went off, but he...

06:21.664 --> 06:24.861
He couldn't have been a vampire.
I've known the man my whole life.

06:25.068 --> 06:27.093
Now Carol Lockwood
is gonna want answers.

06:27.603 --> 06:31.972
And all I can think about right now
is Caroline and I'm...

06:32.141 --> 06:34.109
It's okay. Hey.

06:34.277 --> 06:36.871
- God.
- It's okay.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.014
Bonnie, how's Caroline?

06:41.184 --> 06:42.617
She's weak.

06:42.785 --> 06:45.219
They don't know if she's gonna make it.

06:46.622 --> 06:48.283
What?

06:49.125 --> 06:51.821
Is there something that you can do?
A spell or something?

06:51.994 --> 06:53.586
She doesn't know how.

06:54.030 --> 06:55.327
Do you?

06:55.498 --> 06:57.557
No, I don't.

06:57.733 --> 07:01.464
No, you don't. Because it took Emily years
to learn a spell like that.

07:01.637 --> 07:04.970
Yeah, well, I can take down a vampire.
That spell was easy to learn.

07:05.141 --> 07:07.575
- I can give Caroline some blood.
- No. No way.

07:07.743 --> 07:09.734
Just enough to heal her. She'll be safe.

07:09.912 --> 07:12.073
It'll be out of her system. She'll be better.

07:12.248 --> 07:14.512
- It's too risky. I can't agree to that.
- Do it.

07:16.819 --> 07:18.411
This is Caroline.

07:18.921 --> 07:21.719
Okay? We can't let her die.

07:23.025 --> 07:24.253
Do it.

07:24.427 --> 07:27.863
If I do this, you and me, call a truce?

07:28.030 --> 07:31.363
No. But you'll do it anyway.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.998
For Elena.

07:41.577 --> 07:44.375
I know this is the last thing
you wanna do right now...

07:44.547 --> 07:47.038
...but we should talk about
what happened tonight.

07:47.216 --> 07:50.617
One of the tomb vampires got
into the house and almost killed John.

07:50.786 --> 07:54.415
What? What...? When?
What are you talking about? After I left?

07:55.057 --> 07:58.049
- You were there?
- Come on, Elena, you know I was.

07:58.594 --> 08:00.926
- When were you at the house?
- Really?

08:01.931 --> 08:03.956
Earlier? On the porch?

08:04.167 --> 08:06.658
We were talking, all cathartic,
feelings exposed.

08:06.836 --> 08:08.235
Come on, we kissed, Elena.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.497
Okay, I don't have time for this, Damon.

08:10.673 --> 08:14.200
Hey, if you wanna forget it happened,
fine. But I can't.

08:14.377 --> 08:17.369
Elena? I came as soon as
I got your message.

08:17.547 --> 08:19.242
- How's John?
- Where have you been?

08:20.216 --> 08:23.652
At the Fire Department.
I had to fill out a report.

08:23.819 --> 08:26.447
- I told you earlier. L...
- No, you didn't.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.950
- Yes, I did.
- No, Jenna, you didn't.

08:31.127 --> 08:32.321
Yes, I did.

08:36.065 --> 08:37.293
Oh.

08:39.235 --> 08:42.635
Mm-mm. You gotta be kidding me.

09:02.225 --> 09:03.988
Hey.

09:04.660 --> 09:05.854
How's Caroline?

09:06.462 --> 09:08.327
Not good.

09:12.835 --> 09:14.996
Just what I needed.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.672
Katherine.

09:27.850 --> 09:29.044
Least I fooled one of you.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.511
Feel better?

09:44.033 --> 09:45.625
Stefan?

09:45.801 --> 09:47.632
- Elena.
- What happened?

09:49.505 --> 09:51.564
Katherine happened.

10:00.082 --> 10:02.949
- Did she say what she wanted?
- No.

10:04.387 --> 10:06.048
Woman knows how to make an entrance.

10:06.222 --> 10:09.385
She said she fooled one of us, at least.
What does that mean?

10:09.759 --> 10:13.092
She pretended to be Elena too
when I showed up earlier tonight.

10:13.929 --> 10:16.124
I told Jeremy.

10:16.299 --> 10:19.564
- I can't lie to him anymore.
- You all right?

10:19.735 --> 10:23.034
No, I'm not all right. I thought that,
with all the tomb vampires gone...

10:23.205 --> 10:26.641
...things would get better.
- I know. We all did.

10:26.809 --> 10:28.140
Katherine was in this house.

10:28.311 --> 10:31.303
That means that she's been invited in.
What are we gonna do?

10:31.480 --> 10:33.641
- Move.
- Very helpful. Thank you.

10:33.816 --> 10:37.445
Katherine wants you dead, there's zero
you can do about it. You will be dead.

10:37.620 --> 10:40.282
But you're not,
so clearly she has other plans.

10:40.456 --> 10:42.788
We need to find out
what those other plans are...

10:42.958 --> 10:45.825
...and not provoke her in the process.

10:46.362 --> 10:49.297
What happened tonight
when you thought she was Elena?

10:52.268 --> 10:57.433
To risk another frown line encroaching
on a very crowded forehead...

10:59.208 --> 11:01.438
...we kissed.

11:02.878 --> 11:04.869
- You thought it was me?
- What do you mean?

11:05.047 --> 11:09.381
Well, you know, when two lips pucker
and they go:

11:11.053 --> 11:12.179
Don't be obvious.

11:12.722 --> 11:16.214
Stefan, wait, he kissed Katherine, not me.

11:18.394 --> 11:19.486
I wouldn't do that.

11:22.164 --> 11:23.893
We don't have time for this, guys.

11:24.734 --> 11:25.826
Later.

11:26.001 --> 11:27.400
John must know something.

11:28.037 --> 11:30.733
There has to be a reason
why Katherine tried to kill him.

11:30.906 --> 11:32.032
She's Katherine.

11:33.376 --> 11:35.708
She loves to play games.
You're fooling yourself...

11:35.878 --> 11:38.369
...if you think you're gonna find
what she's up to.

11:38.547 --> 11:41.846
Actually, Elena's right. John could know
something through Isobel.

11:42.017 --> 11:45.282
Your mother was in touch with Katherine.
We can go to the hospital.

11:45.488 --> 11:47.718
- Get him to talk.
- I've got a better idea.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.387
What's that?

11:50.693 --> 11:54.094
I'm just gonna ignore the bitch.
See you.

11:54.263 --> 11:55.355
Is that smart?

11:55.531 --> 12:00.025
If Katherine thinks she's being ignored,
it'll lure her out. She'll make a move.

12:00.202 --> 12:02.033
Yeah? Then what?

12:02.738 --> 12:06.572
Stake her, rip her head off,
something poetic.

12:06.742 --> 12:08.437
We'll see.

12:09.044 --> 12:10.409
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.

12:10.913 --> 12:13.040
- You been here all night?
- With the sheriff.

12:13.315 --> 12:14.407
No one else?

12:14.817 --> 12:18.014
Stefan's brother, Damon,
stopped by late last night.

12:20.790 --> 12:22.621
How is Caroline today?

12:23.659 --> 12:25.889
See for yourself.

12:33.969 --> 12:35.630
<i>Jersey Shore</i> is on.

12:36.772 --> 12:39.070
Oh, careful, still a little sore.

12:39.241 --> 12:40.731
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

12:40.910 --> 12:43.401
But they say I'm healing really quick.

12:43.579 --> 12:45.171
My turn.

12:47.783 --> 12:49.683
Aw. Isn't he cute?

12:50.319 --> 12:52.344
Why are you crying?

12:52.555 --> 12:53.749
- Oh, Bon.
- Heh.

12:53.923 --> 12:56.255
- Oh.
- I'm just happy you're okay.

12:56.425 --> 12:58.188
- Oh, I love you guys.
- We love you.

13:01.764 --> 13:04.824
I wanna know exactly who's responsible
for killing my husband.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.434
I'm looking into it,
but be straight with me.

13:07.603 --> 13:10.333
Is there any reason Richard was affected
by the vampire device?

13:10.506 --> 13:12.872
What are you implying?
That he was one of them?

13:13.075 --> 13:14.542
No, no. No one's implying that.

13:14.710 --> 13:18.043
Your deputies screwed up, plain
and simple, which makes you responsible.

13:18.214 --> 13:21.877
Your husband helped John Gilbert
execute his idiot plan in the first place.

13:22.084 --> 13:24.575
- Liz...
- Someone got my husband killed.

13:24.987 --> 13:26.215
We're all on edge here.

13:27.623 --> 13:30.990
You've suffered a great loss.
The whole town has.

13:31.694 --> 13:34.026
But we have to stick together.

13:34.196 --> 13:37.029
Okay? Trust each other.
We'll get through this.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.920
So the black sheep returns.

14:00.890 --> 14:03.757
- Tyler?
- Yeah.

14:04.226 --> 14:05.488
What happened to you?

14:05.928 --> 14:08.055
In my mind, you're 12 years old.

14:08.230 --> 14:11.427
That's two years older than
the last time you saw me, Uncle Mason.

14:12.668 --> 14:14.260
Come here.

14:15.538 --> 14:18.769
- Good to see you, man.
- It's good to see you too.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.738
Come on inside.

14:26.715 --> 14:28.512
Ready for this?

14:38.861 --> 14:40.226
John?

14:46.468 --> 14:48.732
I'm Elena. I'm not Katherine.

14:50.773 --> 14:53.606
- We know she did this to you.
- We need to know why.

14:53.776 --> 14:55.243
- Where is she?
- You tell us.

14:57.179 --> 14:58.942
I don't know.

15:01.584 --> 15:02.949
You're too weak to play tough guy.

15:03.118 --> 15:07.418
Why don't you just sit back,
answer a few questions?

15:14.229 --> 15:16.754
Please. Tell us why she's here.

15:17.266 --> 15:18.460
What does she want?

15:23.606 --> 15:24.698
She'll try again.

15:25.774 --> 15:28.766
We can't help you
if you don't confide in us.

15:29.144 --> 15:30.771
In you?

15:33.449 --> 15:34.746
In your daughter, then.

15:37.419 --> 15:40.911
My daughter should have driven a stake
through your heart by now.

15:44.827 --> 15:47.227
I never spoke with Katherine directly.

15:47.630 --> 15:49.097
She never trusted me.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.528
So either kill me or get out.

15:54.269 --> 15:57.261
Because I can't stand the sight of you
with my daughter.

15:59.475 --> 16:03.639
You see the world with such hatred.
It's gonna get you killed.

16:17.593 --> 16:21.359
You may be okay with dying,
but I have a better plan for you.

16:24.667 --> 16:26.498
You now have my blood
in your system.

16:26.669 --> 16:28.398
All I have to do is kill you.

16:28.570 --> 16:29.867
Now take my advice.

16:30.039 --> 16:32.405
Leave town. Elena doesn't want you here.

16:32.841 --> 16:36.470
You have 24 hours before the blood
leaves your system. That's enough time.

16:36.645 --> 16:39.671
Or so help me God,
I will turn you into a vampire...

16:39.848 --> 16:44.251
...and I will watch you hate yourself
more than you already do.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.149
The clock starts now.

16:50.659 --> 16:53.059
Who's the guy with Carol?

16:53.228 --> 16:54.889
Mayor's brother, Mason Lockwood.

16:55.064 --> 16:58.056
Is he on the Council?
Like John Gilbert was when he rolled in?

16:58.534 --> 17:01.628
He's nothing like John.
For one, he's not an ass.

17:01.804 --> 17:05.433
He's not a believer either.
He wants nothing to do with the Council.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.837
He's too preoccupied
finding the perfect wave.

17:08.343 --> 17:09.833
Hmm.

17:10.012 --> 17:12.412
Thanks. See you.

17:16.885 --> 17:19.911
Hey, Elena. Thanks for coming.

17:21.022 --> 17:22.684
Come on in.

17:40.576 --> 17:43.204
I have to swing by home
to pick up Jenna and Jeremy...

17:43.378 --> 17:45.710
...so we can go to the Lockwoods'.

17:45.881 --> 17:47.746
How did you leave it in there with John?

17:47.916 --> 17:49.406
I, uh...

17:50.385 --> 17:52.410
I asked him to leave town.

17:52.588 --> 17:54.078
Asked?

17:54.289 --> 17:56.314
You threatened him.

17:56.558 --> 17:58.992
- Yeah, I threatened him.
- Good.

17:59.728 --> 18:01.286
I want him gone, Stefan.

18:01.697 --> 18:06.066
I know I shouldn't feel that way, but
I don't want someone like that in my life.

18:06.235 --> 18:08.169
- Or Jeremy's life.
- I know. I know.

18:12.107 --> 18:13.199
So, what now?

18:14.843 --> 18:16.310
Now...

18:18.680 --> 18:20.341
...I need to go find Damon.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.915
Please, don't fight with him.

18:22.084 --> 18:24.245
He tried to kiss you.
I'm not okay with that.

18:24.419 --> 18:27.047
That's not the problem. Katherine is.

18:27.222 --> 18:29.019
She's messing with both of your heads.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.250
And Damon's not stable
when it comes to her.

18:31.426 --> 18:33.724
The last thing we need
is to make things worse.

18:37.900 --> 18:40.869
Did you know the Gilbert device
affected Tyler Lockwood?

18:41.036 --> 18:44.267
Well, I know it took the mayor down.

18:44.439 --> 18:45.804
Don't you wanna know why?

18:45.974 --> 18:49.466
Yes, Bonnie, I would love to know
why a non-vampire was tortured...

18:49.645 --> 18:53.274
...by the vampire torture device
that you let John Gilbert use against us.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.818
- Speaking of your guilt, how's Caroline?
- She's much better.

18:57.986 --> 18:59.544
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

18:59.721 --> 19:02.053
- Why am I welcome?
- You lived to see another day.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.283
No good deed goes unpunished
with you.

19:04.459 --> 19:07.121
Doesn't undo the bad.
I know what you are, Damon.

19:07.296 --> 19:10.197
You might have Elena and the sheriff
and everybody else fooled.

19:10.365 --> 19:11.992
- But not me.
- Hmm.

19:12.167 --> 19:14.158
One wrong move
and I'm gonna take you out.

19:14.369 --> 19:18.066
Stop with the witches' brew.
You're starting to believe your own press.

19:20.075 --> 19:21.406
Hmm?

19:26.148 --> 19:27.445
Oh.

19:29.117 --> 19:30.812
I'm sorry.

19:30.986 --> 19:32.613
You were saying?

19:37.659 --> 19:40.958
Oh, my God. Damon drives me crazy.

19:41.129 --> 19:44.530
He's walking around like he's some kind
of hero for healing Caroline...

19:44.700 --> 19:47.635
...when it's his fault
all this happened in the first place.

19:47.803 --> 19:51.136
I'm sorry, Bonnie.
What Damon's done is just awful.

19:52.174 --> 19:53.664
Okay.

19:53.842 --> 19:55.833
Better. Hateful Damon moment over.

19:56.011 --> 19:57.945
- Ha, ha.
- Thanks.

20:00.949 --> 20:04.316
Um, I gotta find Tyler, pay my respects.

20:05.487 --> 20:07.921
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.892
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Elena?

20:20.068 --> 20:21.899
- Where are you?
- I know. I'm late.

20:22.070 --> 20:24.504
I'm getting in the car now.
I'll be there in five.

20:33.448 --> 20:36.940
We haven't officially met. I'm Katherine.

20:41.690 --> 20:44.022
- I know who you are.
- Of course you do.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.021
You're the best friend, right?

20:47.663 --> 20:50.427
I've been putting all the pieces
of Elena's life together.

20:50.599 --> 20:52.658
Isobel told me it was a bit of a puzzle.

20:53.068 --> 20:55.036
I do know who Jenna and Jeremy are.

20:55.203 --> 20:59.697
And I've met that delicious ex-boyfriend,
Matt, who's sweet on Caroline...

20:59.875 --> 21:03.811
...and then there's you,
the vampire-hating Bennett witch.

21:03.979 --> 21:05.879
Did I do good?

21:13.255 --> 21:15.485
I've been around a long time, Bonnie.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.921
You're gonna have to do better than that.

21:23.732 --> 21:24.756
Nice.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.924
Katherine.

21:27.302 --> 21:29.497
- Stefan.
- Leave her alone.

21:30.739 --> 21:32.434
Okay.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.917
What are you doing here?

21:47.089 --> 21:48.579
After the way you treated me...

21:48.757 --> 21:51.351
...I thought that a public place
would be less violent.

21:51.526 --> 21:55.257
Taking this a little far, don't you think?
Elena could walk in at any moment.

21:55.430 --> 21:57.364
Mm, but that's part of the fun, Stefan.

21:57.666 --> 21:59.463
Damon's here. Somewhere.

21:59.868 --> 22:01.426
Been avoiding him.

22:01.603 --> 22:02.729
Hey, guys.

22:03.939 --> 22:05.133
Hi, Matt.

22:06.308 --> 22:08.868
I, uh, heard that Caroline's doing
much better.

22:09.044 --> 22:11.274
Her recovery was miraculous.
Must be relieved.

22:11.546 --> 22:13.138
I am.

22:13.315 --> 22:15.146
Thanks, Elena.

22:17.352 --> 22:21.118
- Ahh, his eyes are so blue.
- You need to leave now.

22:21.289 --> 22:23.484
You're hurting my feelings, Stefan.

22:23.658 --> 22:26.126
Damon was much happier to see me.

22:26.294 --> 22:28.353
Then again,
he thought I was your girlfriend.

22:28.530 --> 22:31.055
Katherine, I'm not doing this with you.

22:31.266 --> 22:35.566
Okay. How about we don't have a
couple's fight in front of all your friends?

22:35.771 --> 22:38.262
- Walk with me?
- Just tell me what you're doing here.

22:39.007 --> 22:40.065
Maybe I missed you.

22:41.076 --> 22:43.874
- Is that an acceptable reason?
- What game are you playing?

22:44.046 --> 22:45.741
- Wanna play with me?
- I don't know.

22:45.914 --> 22:48.576
How can I play if I don't know the rules?

22:49.084 --> 22:52.713
No rules, Stefan. Don't you remember?

22:53.355 --> 22:55.152
No rules.

23:16.211 --> 23:18.270
Looks like the whole town
has turned out.

23:18.447 --> 23:21.883
Yeah, well, he is... He was the mayor.

23:22.050 --> 23:25.884
- Why don't they save it for the funeral?
- It's what people do.

23:26.054 --> 23:28.579
The Lockwoods were here for us
when we went through this.

23:28.757 --> 23:31.783
It'll be quick. We'll drop off the food,
pay our respects, go.

23:31.960 --> 23:34.360
In and out? Sounds like a plan.

23:34.529 --> 23:37.054
You guys go ahead.
I'II, uh, be right there, okay?

23:39.701 --> 23:42.226
Hey. How are you doing?

23:42.404 --> 23:45.601
Great, Elena. Walking on sunshine,
thanks for asking.

23:46.208 --> 23:48.233
- Damon...
- Elena.

23:48.410 --> 23:52.107
We should be able to talk about this.
Damon, we're close enough now.

23:52.280 --> 23:54.145
I really wanna know how you're doing.

23:55.383 --> 23:58.477
I kissed you.
Thought you kissed me back.

23:58.653 --> 24:01.451
Doppelganger high jinks ensued.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.348
- How you think I'm doing?
- I think that you're hurt.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.653
Mm, no. I don't get hurt, Elena.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.057
No, you don't admit that you get hurt.

24:09.231 --> 24:12.223
You get angry and cover it up
and then you do something stupid.

24:13.468 --> 24:14.799
You're scared.

24:16.304 --> 24:19.637
You think Katherine's gonna send me off
the deep end, don't you?

24:20.876 --> 24:23.106
I don't need her for that.

24:24.479 --> 24:26.379
You know, why...?

24:28.283 --> 24:30.774
Why is it such a surprise
that I would kiss you?

24:31.486 --> 24:32.919
That's not a surprise.

24:34.656 --> 24:37.591
I'm surprised that you thought
I'd kiss you back.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.092
Now I'm hurt.

24:46.201 --> 24:49.170
- Elena.
- Bonnie, what happened?

24:53.208 --> 24:56.905
- Hey. Sorry. I was just looking for the...
- The bathroom's down the hall.

24:57.078 --> 24:59.842
<i>She says don't let go</i>

25:00.682 --> 25:03.947
Hey, look, I'm sorry about your dad.

25:05.687 --> 25:09.316
Today's been a big day of sorries
from people who really don't give a crap.

25:12.627 --> 25:14.151
I remember when my dad died...

25:14.329 --> 25:18.129
...I had a house full of strangers
telling me what a great guy he was.

25:18.867 --> 25:21.961
Anyway, I know how hard all this is.

25:22.137 --> 25:25.038
Difference is, in your case,
it was true.

25:25.373 --> 25:27.466
My dad was a dick.

25:30.679 --> 25:32.442
Yeah. Yeah, he was.

25:33.515 --> 25:36.109
<i>But the world's got him down on his knees</i>

25:36.985 --> 25:38.543
<i>So she throws him at the wall</i>

25:38.720 --> 25:41.052
I found this in his desk.

25:44.025 --> 25:45.856
He won't mind. He's dead.

25:47.562 --> 25:51.259
Yeah, you know what? Sure. Why not?

25:52.267 --> 25:54.565
- Hey, what's going on in here?
- Nothing.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.665
Nothing.

25:59.207 --> 26:01.198
You got somewhere else to be?

26:05.814 --> 26:09.682
<i>Never give up</i>
<i>It's such a wonderful life</i>

26:09.851 --> 26:13.548
<i>Wonderful life</i>
<i>Wonderful life</i>

26:13.722 --> 26:17.590
<i>Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful life</i>

26:17.759 --> 26:20.284
<i>Don't let go</i>

26:21.896 --> 26:25.559
<i>Never give up</i>
<i>It's such a wonderful life</i>

26:26.501 --> 26:29.197
The Lockwoods have a lot more land
than they used to.

26:29.371 --> 26:32.863
Possessions of all the tomb vampires
built them quite a fortune.

26:33.041 --> 26:35.100
Yeah, why did you want them dead?
Hmm?

26:35.277 --> 26:37.177
- You're the one who turned most of them.
- Heh.

26:37.345 --> 26:40.041
There's nothing more annoying
than a vengeful vampire.

26:40.215 --> 26:41.944
Just ask John Gilbert.

26:43.118 --> 26:47.145
- You haven't changed at all, have you?
- But you have. You're stronger.

26:47.322 --> 26:49.552
Meaner. Sexy.

26:49.724 --> 26:52.386
Don't flirt with me, Katherine.
I'm not Damon.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.324
I haven't spent 145 years
obsessed with you.

26:55.530 --> 27:00.593
Yeah, based on your choice of women,
I'd say otherwise.

27:01.803 --> 27:05.034
Though it does bother me that
you've fallen in love with someone else.

27:05.206 --> 27:08.642
Oh, I was never in love with you,
Katherine.

27:08.810 --> 27:12.473
You compelled me.
So none of my feelings were real.

27:12.647 --> 27:15.309
Believe what you want, Stefan.

27:15.483 --> 27:16.973
But I know the truth.

27:17.452 --> 27:20.114
And deep down, so do you.

27:20.288 --> 27:22.381
- The truth?
- Mm-hm.

27:22.557 --> 27:27.290
Well, the truth is
you're the same lying, selfish...

27:27.462 --> 27:29.657
...manipulative bitch
that you've always been.

27:29.831 --> 27:32.095
So whatever it is
that brought you here...

27:32.867 --> 27:35.529
...why don't you just get on with it
and leave town?

27:35.704 --> 27:41.165
Because if you don't, I will hunt you down
and I will rip your heart out.

27:43.345 --> 27:45.006
You wanna know why I'm here, Stefan?

27:47.649 --> 27:50.015
I came back for you.

27:50.885 --> 27:53.217
Well, the problem, Katherine...

27:54.289 --> 27:56.519
...is that I hate you.

28:00.295 --> 28:01.523
You hate me, huh?

28:01.696 --> 28:05.291
That sounds like the beginning
of a love story, not the end of one.

28:20.048 --> 28:21.481
You gonna be okay?

28:21.649 --> 28:24.015
Yeah, it'll heal.

28:24.185 --> 28:26.346
That's not what I meant.

28:28.823 --> 28:30.313
I was trying to figure her out.

28:30.492 --> 28:34.519
I was playing along. I let her get to me.

28:34.696 --> 28:36.994
Tried to track her, but she's gone.

28:37.165 --> 28:38.427
Ew, cover up, Fabio.

28:38.900 --> 28:41.095
We got a crazy ex on the loose.

28:41.269 --> 28:45.069
Better watch out. Looks like
Katherine's trying to steal your guy.

28:45.540 --> 28:47.405
- That's not what's happening.
- Isn't it?

28:47.842 --> 28:50.709
I mean, it's only fair,
since I went after your girl.

28:53.548 --> 28:55.413
I'm gonna go check
on Jenna and Jeremy.

28:55.950 --> 28:58.248
Let me know when you guys are done.

28:59.921 --> 29:02.856
So, what's it gonna be, huh?
Fight to the death?

29:03.024 --> 29:04.821
- Heh.
- Go ahead. Make your threats.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.426
Stake your claim.

29:07.462 --> 29:10.556
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- Why? I'd fight me.

29:11.232 --> 29:13.962
Katherine will play us against each other.
You know that?

29:14.169 --> 29:18.435
Brother, don't you worry.
Our bond is unbreakable.

29:18.606 --> 29:21.040
We need to stay united against her.

29:21.209 --> 29:24.906
So, yes, as much as I would like to kill you,
I'm not gonna fight you.

29:26.114 --> 29:28.139
I kissed Elena.

29:28.316 --> 29:31.752
Because you feel something for her.
Because you actually care.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.912
I won't let Katherine come in
and destroy that part of you...

29:35.089 --> 29:39.458
...that is finally, after all of this time,
willing to feel something.

29:39.828 --> 29:42.092
She'll try to break you.

29:42.263 --> 29:44.595
She'll try to break us.

29:44.999 --> 29:47.399
And how we respond to that
will define us.

29:48.837 --> 29:50.805
It's our choice.

29:53.942 --> 29:57.070
So, no, I'm not gonna fight you.

30:13.094 --> 30:14.857
Jeremy.

30:16.731 --> 30:18.528
What are you doing here?

30:18.733 --> 30:20.633
I'm packing.

30:21.102 --> 30:22.262
Leaving.

30:22.437 --> 30:26.498
So you figured you'd kill all your evil
vampires and then you'd leave town?

30:27.275 --> 30:28.867
Not all, but enough.

30:29.043 --> 30:30.840
For now.

30:31.012 --> 30:34.971
- Can you tell Elena I said goodbye?
- Why don't you tell her yourself?

30:35.149 --> 30:37.811
You know, Jeremy,
I was taught to hate them.

30:38.653 --> 30:40.314
The vampires.

30:40.488 --> 30:43.116
It's what I know.
It's what your father knew.

30:43.291 --> 30:45.316
My father would've seen things
differently.

30:45.493 --> 30:49.452
No. He may have done things differently,
but there's no other way to see it.

30:52.133 --> 30:56.627
That ring, the one that's supposed to
protect you, that was my father's, right?

30:57.405 --> 30:58.497
Yeah.

30:58.973 --> 31:01.464
Then why didn't it protect him?
Why is he still dead?

31:02.577 --> 31:07.139
What happened to your parents
wasn't supernatural. It was an accident.

31:07.782 --> 31:10.273
There's nothing that can save us
from that.

31:11.352 --> 31:14.048
I wonder what he'd think of all this.

31:14.222 --> 31:15.416
Of me.

31:16.157 --> 31:20.890
He'd think that you're still young,
still finding yourself.

31:21.062 --> 31:23.223
But you are a Gilbert.

31:23.398 --> 31:25.866
You've been exposed
to this town's secret...

31:26.034 --> 31:28.935
...and with that comes responsibility.

31:29.103 --> 31:31.503
I don't believe in that family legacy stuff.

31:33.608 --> 31:36.076
Sooner or later, you'll have to.

32:01.869 --> 32:05.236
- Tyler, what are you doing?
- I hate him.

32:05.406 --> 32:08.534
- Oh, don't say that, honey. Don't ever...
- Let go of me.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.404
- Get off me.
- Hey. Tyler. Hey. Hey.

32:12.580 --> 32:15.640
- I said, get off me. Get the hell off me.
- Tyler.

32:15.850 --> 32:18.580
Look at me. Look at me.

32:18.753 --> 32:20.050
Calm down.

32:20.555 --> 32:22.147
Settle down.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.494
Oh, God.

32:46.280 --> 32:48.908
Very brave of you to come here.

32:50.318 --> 32:52.582
I wanted to say goodbye.

32:56.758 --> 32:58.248
Leaving so soon?

32:58.760 --> 33:00.591
I know where I'm not wanted.

33:00.895 --> 33:02.453
Don't pout.

33:02.630 --> 33:04.689
It's not attractive in a woman your age.

33:06.100 --> 33:07.397
Ouch.

33:09.904 --> 33:11.701
What, no goodbye kiss?

33:12.273 --> 33:13.934
Why don't I kill you instead?

33:16.444 --> 33:17.775
What are you doing here?

33:17.945 --> 33:20.106
Nostalgia. Curiosity. Et cetera.

33:20.615 --> 33:22.981
I'm better at the enigmatic one-liners,
Katherine.

33:23.151 --> 33:25.619
- What are you up to?
- Trust me, Damon.

33:25.787 --> 33:28.119
When I'm up to something,
you'll know it.

33:30.024 --> 33:33.323
Come on. Kiss me. Or kill me.

33:33.494 --> 33:35.121
Which will it be, Damon?

33:35.296 --> 33:38.788
We both know
that you're only capable of one.

33:42.637 --> 33:47.506
My sweet, innocent Damon.

34:00.088 --> 34:01.248
That's more like it.

34:17.972 --> 34:20.735
Okay, wait. Wait.

34:22.342 --> 34:24.243
Brief pause.

34:29.516 --> 34:31.212
I have a question.

34:31.385 --> 34:35.081
Answer it and it's back to fireworks
and rockets' red glare.

34:35.723 --> 34:37.690
Answer it right...

34:38.192 --> 34:41.092
...and I'll forget the last 145 years
I've spent missing you.

34:41.696 --> 34:44.096
I'll forget how much I loved you.

34:44.264 --> 34:47.359
I'll forget everything
and we can start over.

34:47.735 --> 34:51.068
This can be our defining moment.
Because, I mean, we have the time.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.871
That's the beauty of eternity.

34:55.376 --> 34:57.036
I just need the truth. Just once.

34:57.211 --> 34:58.803
Stop.

34:59.814 --> 35:01.577
I already know your question.

35:02.784 --> 35:04.775
And its answer.

35:09.056 --> 35:11.217
The truth is...

35:11.793 --> 35:14.159
...I've never loved you.

35:19.901 --> 35:21.960
It was always Stefan.

35:57.972 --> 35:59.098
Oh, God.

36:00.975 --> 36:02.237
You scared me.

36:02.410 --> 36:04.776
Just doing my part
in the neighborhood watch.

36:06.447 --> 36:09.905
Thanks for, um...

36:10.084 --> 36:11.813
...Iooking out for us. For me.

36:12.520 --> 36:15.921
That's me. Your trusty bodyguard.

36:16.090 --> 36:17.751
Calm in crisis.

36:19.026 --> 36:20.118
You been drinking?

36:23.364 --> 36:25.924
And you're upset.
That's not a good combination.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.499
No, I'm not upset.

36:27.668 --> 36:30.330
Upset is an emotion specific
to those who care.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.966
Come on, Damon. That's a lie. You care.

36:37.812 --> 36:40.440
You're surprised
that I thought you would kiss me back?

36:40.615 --> 36:42.845
You can't imagine
I'd believe you'd want to?

36:43.017 --> 36:45.451
- Damon...
- That what we've been doing here...

36:45.620 --> 36:47.679
...means something?

36:48.389 --> 36:49.856
You're the liar, Elena.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.825
There is something going on between
the two of us and you know it...

36:53.995 --> 36:56.657
...and you're lying to me,
and you're lying to Stefan...

36:56.831 --> 37:00.062
...and most of all, you're lying
to yourself. I can prove it.

37:00.268 --> 37:01.496
No. No...

37:03.404 --> 37:04.837
Damon, don't.

37:05.306 --> 37:07.206
- What's wrong with you?
- Lie about this.

37:07.375 --> 37:09.707
Stop it. You're better than this. Come on.

37:09.877 --> 37:12.744
- That's where you're wrong.
- No. Damon, I care about you.

37:12.914 --> 37:14.643
Listen to me. I care about you.

37:14.815 --> 37:17.579
I do, but I love Stefan.

37:17.785 --> 37:19.878
It's always gonna be Stefan.

37:21.022 --> 37:23.684
Elena, what's going on in here?

37:25.293 --> 37:27.591
Nothing, Jeremy.
It's okay, just go back to bed.

37:27.795 --> 37:29.854
No, it's not okay, Elena.

37:31.599 --> 37:32.861
He wants to be a vampire.

37:34.902 --> 37:36.233
No. Damon, stop it.

37:36.404 --> 37:38.929
Wanna shut off the pain?
It's the easiest thing.

37:39.106 --> 37:41.006
The part of you that cares goes away.

37:41.175 --> 37:43.735
All you have to do is flip the switch
and snap.

37:43.911 --> 37:46.243
Damon. No!

38:30.791 --> 38:32.656
Your mom's out.

38:32.860 --> 38:35.852
Think she popped
a couple pharmaceuticals.

38:36.063 --> 38:37.553
I didn't mean to freak her out.

38:39.633 --> 38:41.624
I don't know why I get like this.

38:42.970 --> 38:45.404
It's the curse of being a Lockwood.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.602
So how'd you get the chill gene?

38:49.243 --> 38:51.905
I didn't.
I've just learned how to manage it.

38:54.882 --> 38:56.975
I don't wanna be like this anymore.

38:57.151 --> 39:00.643
None of us do.
That's why it's a curse, Tyler.

39:07.128 --> 39:10.325
He saw the ring. That's why he did it.
He knew.

39:10.498 --> 39:11.988
He didn't see the ring.

39:12.700 --> 39:14.429
It's Katherine.

39:14.602 --> 39:17.935
She got under his skin. She undid
everything that was good about him.

39:18.105 --> 39:22.303
There's nothing good about him,
Stefan, not anymore.

39:23.277 --> 39:24.835
He's decided what he wants.

39:26.347 --> 39:30.477
<i>He doesn't wanna feel. He wants</i>
<i>to be hated. It's just easier that way.</i>

39:31.552 --> 39:33.281
He got his wish.

39:43.998 --> 39:45.989
- I hate him, Stefan.
- I know.

39:47.034 --> 39:48.626
I know.

39:57.678 --> 39:59.305
Is he okay? Is he okay?

39:59.480 --> 40:01.038
He's okay.

40:01.215 --> 40:02.307
You're okay. Shh.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.144
You're okay. He's okay.

40:04.318 --> 40:06.149
He killed me. Damon killed me.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.844
Shh. It's okay.

40:10.157 --> 40:12.022
Oh, God.

40:27.108 --> 40:28.575
Ah! Elena?

40:29.076 --> 40:30.168
Hi, Caroline.

40:32.213 --> 40:33.771
What are you doing here?

40:35.082 --> 40:36.242
My name is Katherine.

40:36.884 --> 40:40.786
I was hoping you could give
the Salvatore brothers a message for me.

40:41.922 --> 40:43.583
What are you talking about?

40:43.757 --> 40:46.055
What message?

40:48.762 --> 40:50.559
Game on.

40:50.731 --> 40:52.221
What?
