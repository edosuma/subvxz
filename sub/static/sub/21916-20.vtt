<i>Previously on Mystery Incorporated...</i>

00:11.002 --> 00:13.554
Nooo!

00:13.674 --> 00:17.323
The first and second key.
To what and why I don't know.

00:17.443 --> 00:18.932
Tercero llave.

00:19.052 --> 00:20.476
It's the third key.

00:20.768 --> 00:23.385
Nibiru is coming!

00:24.116 --> 00:27.382
The more I research this Nibiru,
the less I think I know.

00:27.502 --> 00:30.961
It must have something to do
with the treasure buried under Crystal Cove.

00:51.837 --> 00:53.132
I don't know, honey.

00:53.281 --> 00:55.522
This doesn't look like the
Crystal Cove from the brochure.

00:55.540 --> 00:56.493
We might be lost.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.520
As usual.

00:57.588 --> 00:58.788
Come on, you call this lost?

00:58.855 --> 01:00.689
We're not lost.
We're on an adventure.

01:00.757 --> 01:03.325
Adventures are stupid.

01:09.098 --> 01:10.031
A man!

01:10.099 --> 01:12.200
A giant man!

01:21.945 --> 01:24.046
Stand and deliver.

01:24.114 --> 01:26.214
I'm the Dandy Highwayman.

01:26.282 --> 01:28.850
And this is a robbery.

01:34.425 --> 01:37.059
All I have is my wedding ring.

01:37.127 --> 01:39.695
I'm afraid it's
not worth much. Hmm.

01:39.763 --> 01:40.963
Uh...

01:41.031 --> 01:43.066
But you're welcome to it.

01:43.134 --> 01:44.668
A treasure, my lady.

01:46.304 --> 01:48.773
And I do trust you're having
a splendid holiday.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.743
Me? You want to know
how I am?

01:51.811 --> 01:53.011
Quite so.

01:53.079 --> 01:54.519
Listening to you talk
about your day,

01:54.580 --> 01:56.382
your dreams, and your desires

01:56.449 --> 01:58.451
will be sweet nectar
to my ears.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.919
Oh, my.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.867
Begging your pardon, my lady.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.035
But will you care
to accompany me?

02:17.103 --> 02:20.705
Me? Now? Ok.

02:32.684 --> 02:37.789
Did mom just take off
with some kind of road pirate?

03:28.674 --> 03:33.545
Oh, Nova.
Hee hee.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.683
To us.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.553
Huh?

03:40.621 --> 03:42.755
Keep eating,
my little love muffin.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.956
I'll get it.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.894
All right, all right.
Hold your horses.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.797
Aah!

03:59.040 --> 04:00.640
Huh?

04:03.144 --> 04:05.645
Aah!

04:16.055 --> 04:17.190
Oh?

04:19.260 --> 04:21.327
Oh, Nova, it was terrible.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.830
You, me, bad robots.

04:23.898 --> 04:26.900
I hate nightmares!

04:28.069 --> 04:29.569
Nibiru.

04:29.637 --> 04:32.939
Nibiru is coming.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.741
Nova, no!

04:34.809 --> 04:36.609
Guys!

04:40.147 --> 04:41.581
Aah!

04:41.649 --> 04:44.117
Huh?

04:45.352 --> 04:48.821
Too many doughnuts
before bedtime.

04:51.425 --> 04:54.294
Um, mom, why do we have
a dynamite shed?

04:54.362 --> 04:56.596
Oh, sweetie, everybody
knows blasting

04:56.664 --> 04:58.231
is the cheapest way
to make a pool.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.001
Uh-huh.

05:01.069 --> 05:03.037
I just know I'm gonna
regret asking this,

05:03.104 --> 05:04.505
but who is that?

05:04.573 --> 05:06.473
Oh, that's pool boy.

05:06.541 --> 05:08.809
I know hiring him may have
been a bit premature,

05:08.877 --> 05:10.311
but just look at him.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.913
And he has the most charming
British accent.

05:12.981 --> 05:15.115
And on that note,
I'm going to Daphne's.

05:15.183 --> 05:16.617
Daphne Blake of the Blakes?

05:16.684 --> 05:17.951
The very rich Blakes?

05:18.019 --> 05:20.053
- That would be the one.
- Brilliant.

05:21.356 --> 05:23.857
I just love that accent.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.227
Thanks, mom.
I really appreciate it.

05:27.295 --> 05:29.362
There's the sweetest purple
dress I saw at the mall.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.897
Freddy's just going to love it.

05:30.965 --> 05:32.966
Oh, Daphne, don't be silly.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.002
You know your father's money
is our money.

05:40.841 --> 05:44.143
Oh, I only need a little.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.110
A little?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.311
I just don't know

05:46.379 --> 05:48.947
where I went wrong
with that girl.

05:49.014 --> 05:50.849
I just love the mall.

05:50.916 --> 05:52.584
Velma, I saw the cutest
little pashmina

05:52.651 --> 05:54.085
that would look perfect on you.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.153
Heh. I don't even know
what that means.

05:56.221 --> 05:58.089
Like, Scooby-Doo and I
love the mall.

05:58.157 --> 06:01.692
I mean, dude, can you say
food court-apalooza?

06:01.760 --> 06:03.160
Of course.

06:03.228 --> 06:04.695
Food...

06:06.598 --> 06:09.000
I can't say it,
but I still love it.

06:09.068 --> 06:10.402
Hee hee hee.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.278
Jinkies!

06:18.345 --> 06:19.980
What happened here?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.348
Like, is it me,

06:21.416 --> 06:23.317
or is this giving
anyone else the creeps?

06:23.384 --> 06:26.453
Me! Me! I got
the super creeps.

06:26.521 --> 06:28.688
Look, someone's up there.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.359
What?

06:33.427 --> 06:35.461
Do you Mystery dorks
have some kind of radar

06:35.529 --> 06:37.530
in that van of yours
that smells trouble?

06:37.598 --> 06:39.833
No, but what a great idea.

06:39.901 --> 06:41.301
Sheriff, what happened?

06:41.369 --> 06:42.803
Was there some kind of pileup?

06:42.870 --> 06:44.704
According to my eye witness,

06:44.772 --> 06:48.642
some guy in a patriot hat is running
around town robbing people.

06:48.710 --> 06:51.912
Then he puts some kind of evil
spell on their women folk

06:51.979 --> 06:55.516
with this kooky English accent
of his and rides off with them.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.185
He calls himself
the Dandy Highwayman.

06:58.253 --> 07:00.821
Marsha!

07:00.888 --> 07:04.491
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!

07:04.558 --> 07:06.927
Looks like we got
another man down.

07:06.994 --> 07:10.163
Sometimes the things I see
on this job,

07:10.231 --> 07:12.065
they don't sit easy.

07:12.133 --> 07:14.301
Hmm. The Dandy
Highwayman?

07:14.368 --> 07:17.772
Well, gang, it looks like we've
got another mystery on our hands.

07:17.839 --> 07:21.509
I wonder where the Highwayman's
going to strike next?

07:23.612 --> 07:25.780
Well, Nan,

07:25.848 --> 07:28.250
here we are on
our Hawaiian vacation.

07:28.317 --> 07:29.784
Just like I promised.

07:29.852 --> 07:32.354
Oh, Barty, it's perf.

07:32.421 --> 07:35.890
None of those annoying tourists
to deal with like last time.

07:35.958 --> 07:37.858
Like I always say, dear,

07:37.926 --> 07:39.560
why leave home
when you're rich?

07:39.628 --> 07:42.196
Regular people are
just so noisy.

07:43.999 --> 07:46.366
Barty, this is not
the time for romance.

07:46.434 --> 07:48.635
I still have to sun my back.

07:48.703 --> 07:50.804
Oh, Nan, you know me
better than that.

07:50.872 --> 07:52.906
It's not Tuesday.

08:00.816 --> 08:03.050
Uhh!

08:05.887 --> 08:07.554
Ahh! Ahh!

08:23.971 --> 08:26.205
Stand and deliver.

08:31.611 --> 08:32.844
The Dandy Highwayman

08:32.912 --> 08:34.746
made my Nan empty the safe

08:34.813 --> 08:37.381
into this big black bag he had.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.717
And then...then he got
on his bike,

08:39.784 --> 08:41.852
held his hand out
to my Nan, and...

08:41.921 --> 08:44.056
It was terrifying, I tell you.

08:44.123 --> 08:45.857
It was like she was possessed.

08:56.068 --> 08:57.636
My beautiful Nan.

08:57.703 --> 09:01.206
I lost her, and I wasn't
even trying this time.

09:01.273 --> 09:02.841
That's how it happened to me.

09:02.908 --> 09:04.876
He brainwashed my girl, too.

09:04.944 --> 09:07.646
My Sally got the spell
put on her just like that.

09:07.714 --> 09:08.881
I can't go on without my wife.

09:08.948 --> 09:11.683
I'm hungry.
I'm really hungry.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.054
Settle down.
Settle down, people.

09:16.122 --> 09:17.243
Let's get some control here.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.890
We're men.
We're tough.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.292
We're warriors.

09:20.359 --> 09:22.694
We can survive anything.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.198
This is a robbery.

09:27.266 --> 09:30.201
Stand and deliver.

09:30.269 --> 09:32.971
Put all your valuables
in this bag.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.340
My only valuable is Scoob.

09:35.407 --> 09:39.445
Nu-uh. I'm not getting
in there, no way.

09:41.648 --> 09:44.049
It is such an honor
to meet you, Mayor Nettles.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.552
It is not every day
one has the opportunity

09:46.620 --> 09:48.588
to be in the presence
of such a powerful

09:48.656 --> 09:51.391
and yet ravishingly
beautiful woman.

09:51.458 --> 09:54.260
I would love to hear
the story of your life.

09:54.328 --> 09:55.595
Mmm.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.897
How you grew up,
how you came to be mayor,

09:57.965 --> 09:59.065
everything.

09:59.133 --> 10:00.800
Every little detail

10:00.868 --> 10:03.136
and every emotion
that came along with it.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.371
What's going on out there?
What's happening?

10:05.439 --> 10:09.241
Won't you please join me,
Madame Mayor?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.112
Oh, take one of these
other losers' women.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.080
Leave my Janet
Mayor Nettles alone.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.787
Janet, no!

10:21.854 --> 10:24.356
You Mystery geeks
have to get her back.

10:24.424 --> 10:27.993
I feel a full body
anxiety cramp coming on.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.532
You can count on us, sheriff.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.601
Gang, let's get this
Dandy Highwayman

10:35.669 --> 10:38.103
off the street before he
gets his hands on our girl.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.505
Oh, Freddy.

10:39.573 --> 10:42.441
Thanks.
Really feeling the love.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.614
Excuse me.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.015
Oh, uh, yes?

10:50.083 --> 10:51.684
We were wondering
if you have any books

10:51.751 --> 10:54.353
on someone called
the Dandy Highwayman?

10:54.421 --> 10:56.289
The Dandy Highwayman?

10:56.356 --> 10:58.157
Hmm. Let me see.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.127
You want the dashing
debonair rogue section.

11:01.195 --> 11:05.265
Right between the swarthy
scoundrel and the exuberant imp.

11:11.405 --> 11:13.640
Oh, I can't stand it anymore.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.779
Ohh?

11:24.318 --> 11:25.351
Hmm.

11:25.419 --> 11:26.952
Huh?

11:35.829 --> 11:37.497
Nova?

11:49.477 --> 11:51.145
Hmm?

11:55.616 --> 12:01.020
Welcome to the sitting room,
Scooby-Doo.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.356
Ahh!

12:03.424 --> 12:04.357
Look at this.

12:04.425 --> 12:05.692
What?!

12:09.162 --> 12:10.763
I said, "Look at this."

12:10.831 --> 12:13.466
All the books on dashing rogues
and debonair thieves

12:13.534 --> 12:16.236
have been checked out by the
woman that have been abducted.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.504
And check this out.

12:17.572 --> 12:19.039
It's a members list
for a book club

12:19.107 --> 12:20.773
with all the ladies'
names on it.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.109
Look, Daph, your mom's on here.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.211
Book club?
My mom hates to read,

12:25.279 --> 12:27.380
unless it's
a shopping catalogue.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.451
Where did this come from?

12:32.519 --> 12:34.120
"Cuarto llave."

12:34.187 --> 12:35.855
It's the fourth key.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.157
Guys, I don't think
it was any accident

12:38.225 --> 12:39.425
that we found this.

12:39.493 --> 12:40.927
But why here?

12:40.994 --> 12:43.396
And how does it tie into
the Dandy Highwayman?

12:43.464 --> 12:45.965
All I know is we have to
come up with some answers fast,

12:46.033 --> 12:47.801
or I might never see
my mother again.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.003
I've got it!
I've got the perfect plan

12:50.071 --> 12:52.072
to trap this Dandy Highwayman.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.691
Like, we're just a couple

12:59.714 --> 13:03.183
of helpless, beautiful
rich women.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.384
Yeah.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.320
We're crazy rich.
Heh heh.

13:07.388 --> 13:09.990
And all alone.

13:10.058 --> 13:12.859
So lonely.

13:12.927 --> 13:15.162
That Dandy Highwayman's
never gonna be able

13:15.230 --> 13:17.465
to resist stranded,
beautiful rich women

13:17.532 --> 13:18.966
on the side of the road.

13:19.034 --> 13:21.035
Yeah, well, maybe
you better take a closer look

13:21.103 --> 13:22.637
at your beautiful women.

13:22.705 --> 13:25.874
Grr. These pantyhose
are itchy.

13:25.941 --> 13:27.876
Fred, I think we need
a plan "B."

13:27.943 --> 13:29.844
Maybe Velma and I could
go out there and...

13:29.912 --> 13:31.580
Nope. No way.
Not happening.

13:31.647 --> 13:33.815
After everything we've
been through, Daphne.

13:33.883 --> 13:37.552
I just got you back. There is
no way that Dandy Highwayman

13:37.620 --> 13:39.255
is getting anywhere
near my woman.

13:39.322 --> 13:42.057
Oh, Freddy.
That's so romantic.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.626
Besides, you know
how weak and vulnerable you get.

13:44.694 --> 13:46.294
You're the easiest
kind of bait.

13:46.362 --> 13:47.863
Remember the...Daph?

13:47.930 --> 13:49.064
Daphne?

13:49.132 --> 13:50.498
She was right here.

13:50.566 --> 13:51.800
Daphne!

13:51.867 --> 13:53.235
Daphne!

13:55.605 --> 13:56.571
Daphne, hold on.

13:56.639 --> 13:58.073
I'm coming to save you.

13:59.475 --> 14:01.209
Whoa.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.349
Daphne!

14:07.416 --> 14:11.156
Daphne, no!

14:20.735 --> 14:22.590
Velm, could you drive
any slower?

14:22.710 --> 14:25.511
Yeah. Shaggy's grandma
drives faster.

14:25.579 --> 14:27.346
I'm not driving slowly.

14:27.414 --> 14:29.916
It's called being cautious.

14:29.983 --> 14:32.485
Did you know that 33%
of all accidents happen

14:32.553 --> 14:34.620
when you're just minutes
away from your house?

14:34.688 --> 14:37.724
Like, we've been minutes away from
your house for the last hour.

14:39.560 --> 14:43.329
This upholstery still has
my Daphne's sweet scent on it.

14:43.397 --> 14:44.797
Oh, Daphne.

14:44.865 --> 14:46.799
Why? Why?

14:46.867 --> 14:48.468
Oh, brother.

14:51.639 --> 14:54.608
Guys, I think we're looking
at our Dandy Highwayman.

14:54.675 --> 14:55.942
It makes perfect sense.

14:56.010 --> 14:57.177
He has a British accent

14:57.244 --> 14:59.079
and he has nothing
but time on his hands.

14:59.147 --> 15:01.748
Pool boy literally
has nowhere to be

15:01.816 --> 15:03.484
and nothing to do.

15:03.551 --> 15:04.852
It's pathetic.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.954
Nowhere to be
and nothing to do?

15:07.022 --> 15:09.423
Hee hee. That guy's
living my dream.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.994
Yeah. Pool boy's a genius.

15:27.845 --> 15:29.879
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

15:29.947 --> 15:32.282
I just thought you might
wish to talk.

15:32.350 --> 15:33.684
What made you think that?

15:33.751 --> 15:35.652
Well, you are a woman.

15:35.720 --> 15:39.222
You see, I understand
such things.

15:39.290 --> 15:42.392
I as well love to share
my innermost feelings.

15:42.460 --> 15:45.295
The sound of a woman talking
incessantly without end

15:45.362 --> 15:47.730
is sweet music to my ears.

15:47.798 --> 15:49.465
No, I'm fine.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.701
I can see you're still
adjusting to being here.

15:51.769 --> 15:54.770
I shall leave you
to your thoughts, my lady.

16:04.082 --> 16:07.819
Do you hear that? It sounds like
one of Daphne's sweet muling coos.

16:07.886 --> 16:09.654
Or it was a beep.

16:09.722 --> 16:11.356
Coming from your pocket.

16:12.992 --> 16:14.859
Daphne just texted me.

16:14.927 --> 16:17.829
She says she's safe
and she's got an idea

16:17.897 --> 16:19.998
how to stop the Dandy
Highwayman.

16:20.065 --> 16:22.734
And so do I.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.415
Excuse me.
Mr. Dandy Highwayman?

16:36.483 --> 16:38.751
I was wondering what
happened to Mrs. Angie Dinkley?

16:38.819 --> 16:41.354
I know not of this
Mrs. Dinkley.

16:41.422 --> 16:42.422
Should I?

16:42.489 --> 16:44.891
Oh, yes.
She is super rich.

16:44.958 --> 16:46.559
Richer than me even.

16:46.627 --> 16:48.394
Oh, and she just loves to read.

16:48.462 --> 16:50.930
And talk.
She is such a talker.

16:50.998 --> 16:52.798
Oh, you would love her.

16:52.866 --> 16:55.701
Thank you, Daphne.

16:55.769 --> 16:59.872
I would hate for Mrs. Dinkley to
feel left out of our little group.

16:59.940 --> 17:03.376
Ladies, I shall return.

17:12.152 --> 17:14.053
Mrs. Dinkley!

17:14.121 --> 17:16.656
I have come!

17:16.723 --> 17:18.758
Sorry, that's Miss Dinkley.

17:18.826 --> 17:20.794
And I'm not going anywhere.

17:20.862 --> 17:22.462
Shaggy, Scooby, now.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.435
Aah!

17:28.502 --> 17:29.836
Aah!

17:31.972 --> 17:34.040
Aah!

17:37.478 --> 17:41.147
Now let's see who this mysterious
woman stealer really is.

17:43.150 --> 17:45.117
The librarian?

17:45.185 --> 17:46.252
Like, seriously?

17:46.320 --> 17:47.887
But you're not even British.

17:47.955 --> 17:50.756
I'm so confused. Why?

17:50.824 --> 17:52.725
It's simple, really.

17:52.793 --> 17:56.929
You spend a life reading about
other people's exciting adventures

17:56.997 --> 18:00.033
and never, never, never
have one of your own.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.267
It's awful.

18:01.335 --> 18:03.036
I'm so lonely.

18:03.104 --> 18:05.705
Jinkies.
How did I miss that one?

18:05.773 --> 18:08.375
I never really had
any friends growing up.

18:08.443 --> 18:11.311
All I had were my books.

18:11.379 --> 18:13.814
For years I stayed in my room

18:13.881 --> 18:16.283
and read about
incredible adventures,

18:16.351 --> 18:18.485
other people's adventures.

18:18.553 --> 18:21.155
Then I got an idea.

18:21.223 --> 18:25.193
I was going to become
the Dandy Highwayman.

18:25.260 --> 18:27.862
I was going to be
the king of adventures

18:27.930 --> 18:30.632
and adored by women everywhere.

18:30.700 --> 18:33.568
I studied how to do
an English accent.

18:33.636 --> 18:35.937
I incorporated
a motorcycle helmet

18:36.005 --> 18:37.573
into my costume's hat

18:37.640 --> 18:42.178
and practiced my motorcycle
skills for hours and hours.

18:42.246 --> 18:46.449
Then I discovered
something unimaginable...

18:46.517 --> 18:50.754
the key to a woman's
total admiration and devotion.

18:50.821 --> 18:55.458
All you have to do is pay attention
to them when they're talking.

18:55.526 --> 18:57.927
Crazy, isn't it?

18:57.994 --> 19:00.996
It wasn't until I started
to moderate the book club

19:01.064 --> 19:03.131
that I learned how to listen.

19:03.199 --> 19:04.899
From there, I actually
became interested

19:04.967 --> 19:06.367
in what women have to say.

19:06.435 --> 19:08.703
Before long, I was
fully engaged

19:08.770 --> 19:10.504
in their desires and feelings.

19:10.572 --> 19:12.540
I was living the dream.

19:12.608 --> 19:14.309
And I would have gotten
away with it

19:14.376 --> 19:17.378
if it weren't for you
meddling romance killers.

19:17.446 --> 19:19.114
I'm not buying it for a second.

19:19.181 --> 19:22.183
You put some kind of voodoo
magic spell on them, you did.

19:22.251 --> 19:24.619
Never. I just listened,
that's all.

19:24.687 --> 19:26.388
Except when the going
got tough.

19:26.456 --> 19:29.057
I had a little help.

19:29.125 --> 19:32.360
These earplugs were
the only magic I used.

19:32.428 --> 19:35.263
I knew it! I knew there
was some kind of trick involved.

19:35.331 --> 19:39.267
Listening to women?
Who ever heard of such a thing?

19:40.102 --> 19:42.270
Jeepers.
The librarian?

19:42.338 --> 19:44.039
I kind of feel bad for him.

19:44.106 --> 19:46.108
You know, he never really
abducted the wives.

19:46.175 --> 19:47.476
They said they went
with him willingly

19:47.544 --> 19:49.745
because he was mysteriously
charming and...

19:49.813 --> 19:51.146
We know, we know.

19:51.214 --> 19:53.782
The whole listening
and paying attention thing.

19:53.850 --> 19:55.050
We get it already.

19:55.118 --> 19:57.619
Whatever.

19:57.687 --> 19:59.454
You know, Freddy,

19:59.522 --> 20:02.558
that kidnapping really turned out
to be a great experience for me.

20:02.625 --> 20:05.360
I had the perfect man
right at my fingertips.

20:05.428 --> 20:06.795
And I didn't want him, Freddy.

20:06.863 --> 20:08.063
I wanted you.

20:08.130 --> 20:10.465
You bet, Daph.
I'd love some ice cream.

20:10.533 --> 20:12.567
Fred Jones, what are
you talking about?

20:12.634 --> 20:15.136
Were you even listening
to a single word I said?

20:15.203 --> 20:18.272
Yep, listening like a man.

20:19.974 --> 20:21.341
I'm glad after all this,

20:21.409 --> 20:23.209
that's what you came away
with, Fred.

20:23.277 --> 20:26.079
Awesome! Like, Velma,
that's the best talk

20:26.146 --> 20:27.980
we've had since we broke up.

20:28.048 --> 20:29.782
Hmph.

20:37.156 --> 20:38.323
Ohh!

20:39.859 --> 20:41.660
Scooby-Doo.

20:41.727 --> 20:44.329
The time has come.

20:44.397 --> 20:47.566
She is here.

20:52.105 --> 20:53.673
Nova?

20:53.740 --> 20:55.041
I am not Nova.

20:55.109 --> 20:56.643
I've only borrowed her body

20:56.710 --> 20:59.011
so that I may bring you
an urgent message.

20:59.079 --> 21:01.714
Scooby-Doo, your life
is in danger.

21:01.782 --> 21:02.715
Huh?

21:02.783 --> 21:04.350
I am of the Anunnaki,

21:04.418 --> 21:06.853
interdimensional beings
that visit the planet earth

21:06.920 --> 21:08.821
every few thousand years.

21:08.889 --> 21:10.890
We arrive at a time
call Nibiru,

21:10.958 --> 21:13.860
when the barriers between
our worlds grow weak.

21:13.928 --> 21:17.130
The Anunnaki have a great
history of helping humans,

21:17.197 --> 21:20.400
but we have no physical form
and must inhabit animals.

21:20.467 --> 21:23.470
This is why some animals,
our descendants,

21:23.538 --> 21:25.739
can talk and others cannot.

21:25.807 --> 21:28.742
But not all Anunnaki
are kind and good.

21:28.810 --> 21:30.477
There are evil ones.

21:30.545 --> 21:32.179
And the most evil one of all

21:32.247 --> 21:34.382
is imprisoned
beneath Crystal Cove

21:34.450 --> 21:36.218
and must not be set free.

21:36.285 --> 21:38.220
You must undo it,
Scooby-Doo.

21:38.288 --> 21:39.321
Undo it all.

21:39.389 --> 21:40.522
Save yourself.

21:40.590 --> 21:41.857
Save your friends.

21:41.925 --> 21:44.026
Save the world.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.861
Hmm? Hmm?

21:45.929 --> 21:49.398
Uh, the cursed treasure
is evil. Evil!

21:49.466 --> 21:52.101
We have to destroy it.
