01:30.419 --> 01:33.380
Thank you
for your persistent loyalty.

01:33.459 --> 01:37.300
Until the sun goes out
and sinks into the ocean.

01:37.380 --> 01:39.860
Why did you call me here?

01:40.699 --> 01:43.780
It's about
the prophecy in the boat house.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.860
We may have
misinterpreted the vision.

01:48.259 --> 01:51.179
-How?
-The creature I saw,-

01:51.259 --> 01:53.740
-she who has travelled
in time's every direction, and-

01:53.819 --> 01:59.300
-who will release your power again,
is maybe not the one we thought.

02:00.660 --> 02:04.780
What do you mean? Didn't Madeleine
travel in time's every direction?

02:04.860 --> 02:07.140
She did.

02:07.220 --> 02:11.259
But I recently ran into one who
has been on the same journey.

02:11.340 --> 02:14.539
And her light shines much stronger.

02:20.299 --> 02:22.259
Who is this woman?

03:49.340 --> 03:52.060
Beta-Zero to Queen B, over.

03:52.139 --> 03:55.060
Queen B speaking.
Any news on the package, over?

03:55.139 --> 03:58.940
Directional coordinates confirm that
it will soon pass the checkpoint.

03:59.019 --> 04:00.979
Over and out.

04:42.939 --> 04:46.660
I am your teacher.

04:47.460 --> 04:51.220
You are my pupil.

04:52.059 --> 04:56.739
-It is raining outside.
-It is raining outside...

04:57.059 --> 04:59.580
It is raining outside.

04:59.660 --> 05:01.979
It is raining...

05:02.059 --> 05:04.859
It is raining outside.

05:05.580 --> 05:08.979
Why the fuss?
It's an hour until the plane leaves.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.539
They close the gate
20 minutes before take-off.

05:11.619 --> 05:15.260
-Is this your first time flying?
-Actually, yes.

05:17.179 --> 05:20.179
What did London say
about the agenda for the meeting?

05:20.260 --> 05:22.539
Just that it was about Ben Joseph.

05:22.619 --> 05:27.780
They didn't seem too interested
in discussing the details via email.

05:41.299 --> 05:45.499
Maybe you should consider
taking a bag next time?

05:46.419 --> 05:51.979
-Are you dissing my travel chest too?
-Just a piece of constructive input.

05:55.539 --> 05:59.780
It's nothing to worry about. It's
more dangerous to drive than to fly

05:59.859 --> 06:04.140
Much more dangerous. You're
2000 times more likely to die from-

06:04.220 --> 06:07.859
- a car crash than in an airplane.
-Are you afraid of flying, Lars?

06:07.939 --> 06:10.619
No.
Of course not.

06:20.700 --> 06:23.820
-I can give you my hand if it helps.
-Oh shut up.

07:31.260 --> 07:35.859
How could an intelligent lady like
Ingrid fall for such a simpleton?

07:35.939 --> 07:38.260
Apparently, he's an amazing dancer.

07:38.340 --> 07:43.100
The penchant for physical indulgence
among today's youth is alarming.

07:43.179 --> 07:49.020
-Oh, she's coming. Put that away.
-Where is the away-clicker?

07:49.100 --> 07:54.780
-Hi! How did it go?
-I'm about five weeks pregnant.

07:55.859 --> 07:59.660
Did you schedule
the planned procedure?

08:03.820 --> 08:05.820
-What..?
-I can't do this right now, Mum.

08:05.900 --> 08:09.979
You can't just walk away like this.
We have to talk about it.

08:10.059 --> 08:13.179
I'd like to congratulate you
on identifying Mr. Ben Joseph.

08:13.260 --> 08:18.700
There may be a link between the
English and Norwegian murders.

08:18.780 --> 08:20.859
-How so?
-A credit card transaction-

08:20.939 --> 08:24.700
-places Ben Joseph near the East End
site at the time of our murder.

08:24.780 --> 08:27.260
We have indications
that he travelled to Oslo-

08:27.340 --> 08:29.539
-several days before your
victim was murdered.

08:29.619 --> 08:33.379
Do you really think he
can be behind the murders?

08:33.460 --> 08:36.060
Why did he do what he did
at our police station?

08:36.139 --> 08:39.180
Who knows how
a man like that reasons?

08:39.259 --> 08:42.100
Did BirchNest release
the full patient journal?

08:42.180 --> 08:45.659
Yes, Ben Joseph was admitted due
to a breakdown he had-

08:45.739 --> 08:47.739
-when he learned
about the Holocaust.

08:47.820 --> 08:50.779
Apparently he lost
all his descendants in the camps.

08:50.859 --> 08:54.540
Stop a little...
What is Holocaust?

08:55.580 --> 08:58.060
We'll talk about that later.

08:58.139 --> 09:01.739
I still can't quite
wrap my mind around this.

09:01.820 --> 09:05.060
Why are the Luddites
involved with Ben Joseph-

09:05.139 --> 09:08.259
-if he is a delusional killer?

09:10.379 --> 09:14.859
Excuse me for a second.
I... I need to take this. I'm sorry.

09:17.019 --> 09:20.060
Hey, I'm in the middle
of an important meeting.

09:20.139 --> 09:22.700
Can I call you in about an hour?

09:22.779 --> 09:26.300
-Yes, I guess that's fine.
-I can tell that's not fine.

09:26.379 --> 09:29.300
-What's the matter?
-Mum...

09:29.379 --> 09:32.540
-She's so pushy about that abortion.
-Isn't that what you want, too?

09:32.619 --> 09:34.859
It's not as simple as she thinks.

09:34.940 --> 09:39.139
She says it's my choice, but isn't
it a bit douchey not to say anything?

09:39.220 --> 09:42.979
-To the father, you mean?
-Mum apparently googled him and Olaf.

09:43.060 --> 09:47.779
She thinks they're some
Christian psychos, but... Still...

09:49.779 --> 09:52.220
I don't have all the answers, Ingrid.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.940
You'll just have to do
what feels right for you.

10:01.859 --> 10:05.259
-Raining outside.
-Indeed.

10:05.340 --> 10:08.899
It's often like that here.

10:09.859 --> 10:13.779
I'm sorry.
I had to address a private matter.

10:13.859 --> 10:18.139
No worries. We have picked
up a message indicating-

10:18.220 --> 10:22.180
-that Mr. Ben Joseph
and Ms. Abeke are still in Norway,

10:22.259 --> 10:24.619
Hiding out in a Luddite cell
in the Oslo region.

10:24.700 --> 10:29.340
The Ned Ludd Society
has its ideological origin among-

10:29.420 --> 10:33.779
-the opponents to the industrial
revolution in 19th century Britain

10:33.859 --> 10:37.100
However, they have
an intricate communication network.

10:37.180 --> 10:42.019
They don't use modern communication
devices. They use doves.

10:43.180 --> 10:46.300
-Doves?
-Homing pigeons, to be exact.

10:46.379 --> 10:49.619
All these are
Luddite-operated dovecots.

10:49.700 --> 10:52.659
They have birds flying
from Oslo to London?

10:52.739 --> 10:54.859
The birds can't travel that distance.

10:54.940 --> 10:59.100
Probably there is a web of Luddite
dovecots in your territory as well.

10:59.180 --> 11:03.060
The bottom line is: Find out
who sent the message from Oslo.

11:03.139 --> 11:07.420
That's where Mr. Ben Joseph
and Ms. Abeke are hiding.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.779
The car is on its way.

11:20.859 --> 11:24.180
There's one last thing
I wanted to bring up.

11:24.259 --> 11:28.019
Have you found any leads on
Ben Joseph being involved-

11:28.100 --> 11:32.259
-in the Ripper investigation
in his time of origin?

11:32.340 --> 11:35.580
-Of course not.
-I found his name-

11:35.659 --> 11:39.779
-in a scholarly article
on the Whitechapel murders.

11:41.019 --> 11:44.619
-Yes...
-Scholarly seems like a stretch.

11:44.700 --> 11:48.899
You'd find many named
Ben Joseph in 19th century London.

11:48.979 --> 11:53.659
Are the Oslo police adhering to the
Ripper fantasies of the Luddites?

11:53.739 --> 11:57.100
I guess we're just trying
to keep an open mind.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.820
I think I need more foundation...

12:30.220 --> 12:33.180
Are you sure?

12:35.940 --> 12:38.180
I'll be right back.

12:38.820 --> 12:41.580
Ingrid.
What a joyful surprise.

12:41.659 --> 12:46.220
-Sorry for bothering you at work.
-That's fine. We're on in an hour.

12:46.300 --> 12:50.300
There's something we need
to talk about. It's kind of private.

12:50.379 --> 12:54.100
Yes, come. I know a place.
Look. Come on in.

12:54.180 --> 12:58.739
I've been thinking a lot about our
night together. It was fantastic.

12:58.820 --> 13:02.940
It was the way you...
I don't even know how to explain it.

13:03.019 --> 13:05.779
That's kind of why I'm here.

13:07.820 --> 13:10.499
I'm pregnant.

13:12.619 --> 13:14.979
Is it a son?

13:16.220 --> 13:19.100
This isn't
the right thing for me now.

13:19.180 --> 13:22.820
And I've decided to have an abortion.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.300
Abortion?
What's an abortion?

13:27.340 --> 13:29.700
What abortion is?

13:33.259 --> 13:37.700
A medical procedure
where you terminate the pregnancy.

13:41.540 --> 13:44.180
That's out of the question, Ingrid.

13:45.779 --> 13:51.979
This was a mistake. I'd hoped we
could talk about this like adults.

13:52.060 --> 13:55.460
We have talked.
And the answer is no.

13:55.540 --> 13:59.859
I understand you might think this
is your choice, but...

14:02.180 --> 14:05.979
If you kill the baby,
it'll be the last thing you do.

14:06.739 --> 14:08.979
Do you understand?

14:11.220 --> 14:13.220
Good.

15:15.859 --> 15:17.979
Alfhildr?

15:19.940 --> 15:23.420
You know what?
I think you're sleepwalking.

15:24.859 --> 15:27.700
I'll take you back to your room.

15:56.979 --> 15:59.979
I see we have company today.

16:00.060 --> 16:03.619
Yes.
This man will lead my case.

16:09.019 --> 16:13.060
Haraldsson has filed a subpoena
with Sør-Trøndelag District Court-

16:13.139 --> 16:17.220
-that the remains of King Magnus,
which came into police custody,-

16:17.300 --> 16:19.859
-are checked against his DNA.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.899
You can't demand
a DNA test in beforeigner cases.

16:22.979 --> 16:25.619
But this isn't about beforeigner law.

16:25.700 --> 16:30.619
He claims to be Magnus the Good's
father and must have it investigated.

16:30.700 --> 16:34.300
I don't know what kind of legal
mumbo-jumbo you're trying to pull,-

16:34.379 --> 16:37.739
-but this pro forma paternity case
is too old to be relevant.

16:37.820 --> 16:41.899
There is no statute of limitations
in paternity cases.

16:41.979 --> 16:45.060
I also need to inform you that
I'm recording this conversation.

16:45.139 --> 16:47.379
I'll deliver it to the International
Court of Justice in The Hague-

16:47.460 --> 16:50.700
-if you deny my client
his basic human rights.

16:50.779 --> 16:53.100
Then, I...

16:53.899 --> 16:59.820
I would like to consult our legal
department before we proceed.

16:59.899 --> 17:01.859
Go ahead.

17:02.739 --> 17:04.659
Kåre?

17:07.820 --> 17:10.419
Do you know what the eggs cost?

17:10.859 --> 17:14.699
They're free.
All of this is free.

17:15.580 --> 17:18.219
-You're joking?
-No.

17:18.619 --> 17:21.820
Breakfast is included in the price.

17:35.340 --> 17:37.859
I don't mean to intrude...

17:37.939 --> 17:41.659
Have you considered being evaluated
for Temporal sleep disorder?

17:41.740 --> 17:43.939
Why do you ask?

17:45.060 --> 17:49.419
You knocked on my door last night,
in nothing but your underwear.

17:52.859 --> 17:54.780
Did you fuck me?

17:55.659 --> 17:59.659
No. Of course not.
What do you take me for?

17:59.740 --> 18:02.899
-A man.
-I don't know what you're used to,-

18:02.980 --> 18:07.859
-but where I'm from, abusing women
in their sleep is not accepted.

18:07.939 --> 18:10.379
I guess we're
from different neighbourhoods.

18:10.459 --> 18:14.699
TSD can be a grave medical problem.
Professionals must evaluate you.

18:14.780 --> 18:18.540
I have already had a checkup with
a skilled seeress from the old faith.

18:18.619 --> 18:22.219
This is not about faith,
but about science.

18:22.300 --> 18:25.219
The same science that
came up with sanitary pads.

18:25.300 --> 18:28.820
But maybe you still think
moss works better?

18:30.619 --> 18:33.740
I'll think about it, okay?

18:35.820 --> 18:39.899
I had an interesting email
exchange with an ornithologist.

18:39.980 --> 18:42.139
They've observed
several homing pigeons-

18:42.219 --> 18:46.060
-flying in and out of the forest
on the east side of Nordmarka.

18:46.139 --> 18:49.020
Are there Luddite farms
in that part of the forest?

18:49.100 --> 18:51.219
Not that I know.

18:53.379 --> 18:55.419
Okay.

18:57.139 --> 18:59.419
I have an idea.

19:03.939 --> 19:06.820
Maybe you
want to tell them about your plan?

19:06.899 --> 19:11.859
Most of the observations by Oslo
Homing Pigeon Club are here.

19:12.340 --> 19:15.580
Wildlife Services have
also noticed these birds.

19:15.659 --> 19:20.699
They seem to have a stopover on
the roof of a block in Enerhaugen.

19:21.619 --> 19:26.219
My idea is that we catch one
of the pigeons and let it lead us.

19:26.300 --> 19:29.540
How will the poor bird lead us
to anything if we catch it?

19:29.619 --> 19:33.580
We'll do what the English did,
and put a PMS on the dove.

19:34.619 --> 19:38.540
She means GPS. Wildlife Services
say they'll lend us a tracker.

19:38.619 --> 19:42.859
This might work. Should I request
back-up for potential arrests?

19:42.939 --> 19:46.780
Yes. If the tracking yields
results, we'll have to go all in.

19:46.859 --> 19:51.659
Famous killer on the loose in the
capital. Read all about it!

19:51.740 --> 19:53.740
Buy the Citizen!

19:53.820 --> 19:56.500
Is Jack the Ripper behind the murder?

19:56.580 --> 19:58.619
I'll have a paper.

20:04.219 --> 20:06.859
Did you see this?

20:07.619 --> 20:10.780
The press is dragging Jack the Ripper
into the subway murder.

20:10.859 --> 20:13.379
-Have you informed London?
-No.

20:13.459 --> 20:15.859
No, and I'm
not looking forward to it either.

20:15.939 --> 20:21.179
They already sent a cross email
about Haaland's behaviour yesterday.

20:23.740 --> 20:25.740
Lars!

20:35.899 --> 20:40.619
We never got around to thanking you
for revealing Ben Joseph's identity.

20:40.699 --> 20:44.139
That may be a breakthrough
in the investigation.

20:44.219 --> 20:46.340
I can tell something is wrong

20:46.419 --> 20:50.459
I think it was very unwise of you
to bring up the Ripper theory-

20:50.540 --> 20:55.100
-in front of the Yard when we
all agreed to leave that theory.

21:00.659 --> 21:02.699
Are you insinuating
that I'm behind the leak?

21:02.780 --> 21:06.820
Of course not. But it's a priority
particularly from the English side,-

21:06.899 --> 21:10.659
- to avoid such speculations.
-It simply does not look good-

21:10.740 --> 21:16.020
-to bring this up with London, while
it leaks to the Norwegian press.

21:16.100 --> 21:20.020
I mean, all I did was discuss
Ben Joseph's background.

21:20.100 --> 21:25.540
The only conspicuous thing, was
the reaction from the English agents.

21:25.619 --> 21:28.939
-Like they were hiding something.
-Hiding something?

21:29.020 --> 21:31.179
-The moment...
-Lars.

21:31.260 --> 21:35.419
Did we maybe rush you too much
when we brought you back full time?

21:35.500 --> 21:39.740
I can sense traces of the mindset you
had before you went on leave.

21:39.820 --> 21:43.699
You do understand that we can't
go down that road again?

21:43.780 --> 21:50.179
Yes, yes, if this is about this Jack
the Ripper thing, you can contact...

21:51.219 --> 21:56.899
Hey, I thought I'd just
ask how it's going with-

21:56.980 --> 22:01.100
-the ancient medicinal evaluation
of your sleep problems?

22:01.179 --> 22:03.899
The seid woman concluded
that I don't have TSD.

22:03.980 --> 22:07.580
That's good.
But in case you would want a more...

22:07.659 --> 22:11.659
I have already decided to
do the modern evaluation too.

22:11.740 --> 22:15.340
-That's very good news, Alfhildr.
-Yes.

22:16.260 --> 22:21.060
-Hi. What was the meeting about?
-The usual nonsense. And the pigions?

22:21.580 --> 22:25.580
We're putting up
the observation post tomorrow.

22:31.379 --> 22:34.939
-What happened?
-Our daughter is lying in her room

22:35.020 --> 22:38.459
Terrified, because
she chose to follow your advice.

22:38.540 --> 22:42.100
-What do you mean by that?
-She told the one night stand about-

22:42.179 --> 22:47.379
-the situation. And he threatened
to kill her if she has an abortion.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.100
Bloody hell.

22:53.619 --> 22:56.500
-Thank you for your quick response.
-No problem.

22:58.300 --> 23:03.139
You should know that I only told
Ingrid it was her decision to make.

23:03.219 --> 23:07.419
Today's youth need guidance
from responsible adults.

23:07.500 --> 23:10.820
-Not just freedom.
-Hi, dad.

23:12.859 --> 23:15.419
What's that smell down here?

23:15.980 --> 23:20.020
The emotional turmoil
made me light a pipe indoors.

23:20.100 --> 23:24.740
-But it will not happen again.
-What did that guy say to you really?

23:24.820 --> 23:28.020
Basically that he'll kill me
if I don't have that baby.

23:40.100 --> 23:42.260
We'll sort this out, honey.

24:07.659 --> 24:10.699
Sierra 2.0 To HQ. We have visual
contact with the suspect.

24:10.780 --> 24:13.260
Awaiting orders, over.

24:26.780 --> 24:30.780
HQ to Sierra 2.0.
Implement plan.

24:40.820 --> 24:45.780
Police! This is police!
Get down on the ground.

24:46.300 --> 24:50.260
Sierra 2.0 to HQ.
The suspect has been apprehended.

24:50.340 --> 24:53.179
The pigeon will be
on its way shortly.

25:30.219 --> 25:34.419
Don't you hate it when women
stick their heads together?

25:34.500 --> 25:37.780
Acting like we don't exist.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.740
I'm starting to get used to it.

25:46.740 --> 25:49.020
A new bird has arrived.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.699
Is it bad news?

26:46.260 --> 26:50.980
This is the police! Turn towards
the wall! Up against the wall. Now.

26:52.260 --> 26:54.740
Police!

26:56.500 --> 27:00.139
-Up against the wall. Arms out.
-Stop!

27:05.179 --> 27:07.980
-Get down!
-Lie still!

27:08.580 --> 27:11.139
-Come on!
-Out here!

27:28.020 --> 27:31.020
Congratulations
on a fine piece of work.

27:31.540 --> 27:35.379
-How do we proceed from here?
-The officers that assisted-

27:35.459 --> 27:38.340
-are collecting fingerprints
and personal data now.

27:38.419 --> 27:42.859
Haaland and I will start the
interrogations when they're done.

27:42.939 --> 27:46.740
Lars played a key part in the arrest.

27:46.820 --> 27:51.859
From management's point of view,
it might seem more natural-

27:51.939 --> 27:54.740
-that these interrogations
are handled internally.

27:54.820 --> 27:58.659
-I see.
-We appreciate your contributions.

27:58.740 --> 28:02.459
But remember that
you are only a hired consultant.

28:10.260 --> 28:14.020
-Where did you get that from?
-One of the girls' room.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.300
Didn't know Luddites were into that.

28:16.379 --> 28:18.379
I guess they
are more complex than it seems.

28:18.459 --> 28:22.340
-Should we sort it as a find?
-No, stop messing around.

28:23.540 --> 28:26.699
-Hey. Do you need any help?
-Hey, no, we're fine...

28:26.780 --> 28:31.379
-It looks like quite a lot.
-No. Thanks. We're fine, really.

28:37.540 --> 28:40.540
Why? This has to be
more than four hours of work.

28:40.619 --> 28:46.419
That easily becomes eight hours when
he starts digging into everything.

28:56.139 --> 28:58.219
What could this be?

28:58.300 --> 29:02.219
Just some Luddites
searching for relatives.

29:03.060 --> 29:05.500
Toss it in the bin.

29:12.459 --> 29:16.260
I think we should enter this,
to be on the safe side.

29:22.980 --> 29:27.419
So, what did the municipality say?

29:27.780 --> 29:29.780
They conceded your claim.

29:29.859 --> 29:34.699
Just get in touch with the hospital.
They'll do your DNA testing.

29:34.780 --> 29:39.219
-Good. Good.
-As the subpoena was public,-

29:39.300 --> 29:42.419
-we are starting to receive
a few calls from the media.

29:42.500 --> 29:46.500
Do you need any help
writing a statement?

29:46.580 --> 29:48.580
No.

29:49.300 --> 29:52.260
Now we'll let
the blood do the talking.

30:19.419 --> 30:21.899
So, let's start with
some practical info.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.939
Your name is Isaac Ben Joseph, right?

30:29.980 --> 30:32.939
Answer the question, please.

30:33.899 --> 30:36.699
Come on.
We don't have time for games.

30:42.859 --> 30:49.780
Well... If you need a name, I
suppose I'll have to give you a name.

30:52.740 --> 30:55.179
May i?

31:34.580 --> 31:37.619
You found it.
Good.

31:40.820 --> 31:43.139
Have you hidden my medicine?

31:43.219 --> 31:46.859
Who hid what
is a matter of definition.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.939
Just tell me where it is, okay?

31:52.139 --> 31:55.780
This is the only medicine you need.

31:59.980 --> 32:03.139
The drops come
straight from Mime's well.

32:12.540 --> 32:14.500
Hello?

32:16.699 --> 32:18.980
-How did the interrogation go?
-Shitty.

32:19.060 --> 32:23.060
Ben Joseph
refuses to talk to anyone but you.

32:23.139 --> 32:26.139
-Why?
-No idea.

32:26.219 --> 32:30.580
He just wrote down your name
and said that's how it's going to be.

32:30.659 --> 32:34.980
-What's the plan then?
-You take over from tomorrow morning.

32:35.060 --> 32:40.100
Management might have
some objections, won't they?

32:40.179 --> 32:44.139
I've already talked to Eriksen. They
say they'll eat some bullets-

32:44.219 --> 32:47.540
-to get Ben Joseph to talk.
What do you say?

32:48.219 --> 32:51.980
-Are you ready?
-Yes. I'm ready.

33:28.859 --> 33:31.020
Here are your earthly possessions.

33:31.100 --> 33:34.179
Try keeping your path clean
for the rest of your journey.

33:34.260 --> 33:37.219
You don't need
to treat me like a criminal.

33:37.300 --> 33:41.939
-I'm not convicted of anything yet.
-Many are acquitted these days.

33:42.459 --> 33:47.540
...the man who claims to be Olaf the
Stout presented DNA tests...

33:48.459 --> 33:51.100
Can you turn that up, please?

33:59.500 --> 34:04.020
Were you born an asshole,
or did this place turn you into one?

34:04.100 --> 34:07.300
I guess it's a combination.

34:20.980 --> 34:23.219
Hi!

34:23.299 --> 34:26.659
I just have to check something.

34:28.619 --> 34:32.940
Even though the court released you,
this is far from over.

34:33.020 --> 34:38.819
You are still charged, and we have
not found an alibi so far. You hear?

34:39.380 --> 34:41.739
I wanted to find the news
about Olaf Haraldsson.

34:41.819 --> 34:44.739
What good would that do you?

34:46.060 --> 34:49.619
I think he's behind
what I was accused of.

34:50.659 --> 34:54.460
You mean Olaf vandalised
his own church?

34:54.540 --> 34:57.580
He apparently needed
bones from Magnus-

34:57.659 --> 35:00.339
-to get some sort
of modern proof of who he is.

35:00.420 --> 35:04.659
And he hits the Old Norse Faith
movement at the same time.

35:06.060 --> 35:08.540
How did the evidence
end up at your place?

35:08.619 --> 35:11.980
-He had it planted.
-The caretaker's log shows that you-

35:12.060 --> 35:15.900
-locked the basement door after
taking out a firepit.

35:15.980 --> 35:20.540
-There was no sign of forced entry.
-I have no idea how, okay?

35:24.540 --> 35:28.500
But that dickhead has
had something to do with this.

35:31.060 --> 35:35.699
The needle is here.
And then... One, two, three.

35:36.139 --> 35:40.100
-You okay?
-I've felt worse blows.

35:50.619 --> 35:56.380
Today we're going to talk about
a scripture God has put in our blood.

35:57.060 --> 36:00.259
A scripture called D N A.

36:02.259 --> 36:07.819
And about the desecration done
by heathens at the Nidaros Cathedral.

36:07.900 --> 36:12.819
First, I couldn't understand that
God would allow such contempt.

36:17.500 --> 36:22.500
Doesn't He understand that my son,
King Magnus the Good of Norway,-

36:22.580 --> 36:25.380
-rested under those rocks?

36:26.020 --> 36:29.179
Doesn't He understand
that I'm the servant-

36:29.259 --> 36:32.779
-who has sacrificed the most?

36:40.860 --> 36:43.699
Of course he does.

36:43.779 --> 36:47.699
Because God has
a plan with everything.

36:58.219 --> 37:03.940
And when I learned about DNA,
I understood what the plan is.

37:06.699 --> 37:10.500
The Lord let Odin's hounds
desecrate my son's grave,-

37:10.580 --> 37:13.860
-so the bones could bear witness.

37:15.420 --> 37:19.420
I now have
the following message to my enemies:

37:21.580 --> 37:24.380
Take my blood.

37:27.580 --> 37:31.580
And God will show you who I am.

38:06.139 --> 38:08.619
No!

38:10.860 --> 38:14.299
I have an appointment now.
Enginnsdottir.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.420
You can follow me.

38:36.779 --> 38:38.699
Hi!

38:47.259 --> 38:49.739
What do you think?
Do I have TSD?

38:49.819 --> 38:51.819
It's a little early to say.

38:51.900 --> 38:56.339
But we'll have more answers
once I've studied your brain.

39:08.219 --> 39:12.659
I'm glad we finally
got the chance to reunite.

39:14.179 --> 39:19.299
-Can we please leave that off?
-We will follow standard protocol.

39:20.739 --> 39:25.900
Where were you before you showed
up at our offices with Miss Abeke?

39:25.980 --> 39:30.139
Let's skip the mundane part. Why
don't you ask me about the book?

39:30.219 --> 39:33.299
You are being questioned
in a murder investigation.

39:33.380 --> 39:36.619
-I advise you to cooperate.
-If you continue that approach,-

39:36.699 --> 39:41.940
-you will reap a harvest as barren
as the one your colleagues found.

39:46.100 --> 39:48.139
The book you refer to.

39:48.219 --> 39:52.020
Is that the obscure science book
you gave me at the police station?

39:52.100 --> 39:54.659
Bingo, Sherlock.

39:58.819 --> 40:02.860
Therein lies
the answer to your dead-girl-riddles.

40:05.900 --> 40:09.299
Just to make sure
I follow your train of thought.

40:09.380 --> 40:14.339
This book will provide an answer to
who killed both the woman in London,-

40:14.420 --> 40:16.420
-and the woman from the tunnels?

40:16.500 --> 40:19.339
If you disregard
the ancient adage.

40:20.779 --> 40:24.259
That a book
should never be judged by its cover.

40:30.819 --> 40:35.020
Now I want you to focus
on the screen in front of you.

41:02.860 --> 41:05.580
-You called on me?
-Yes.

41:05.659 --> 41:09.299
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

41:09.380 --> 41:11.420
Look here.

41:34.699 --> 41:39.460
-Hey, damn right it is.
-Whining about your allergies again?

41:41.779 --> 41:46.980
Why did you neuter the poor thing?
Isn't he like ten years old now?

41:47.060 --> 41:49.179
What exactly are you implying?

41:49.259 --> 41:53.540
-Nothing. I was just curious.
-Right, I see where you're going.

41:53.619 --> 41:58.980
I'm a mean bitch who cut off Anton's
dick because I'm bitter against men.

42:00.139 --> 42:04.219
-No... Is that what I said?
-Don't drag me into this, please.

42:09.540 --> 42:14.259
The Police refuse to comment on the
rumours that the subway murder-

42:14.339 --> 42:17.739
-at Tøyen was committed
by timeigrant Jack the Ripper.

42:17.819 --> 42:23.100
Crime reporter Andreas Hansen,
what are your thoughts here.

42:23.179 --> 42:25.580
The article did seem
rather sensationalist.

42:25.659 --> 42:30.900
But sources confirm that the police
has been in contact with London.

42:30.980 --> 42:37.060
There are undoubtedly things the Oslo
police are keeping from the public.

43:19.060 --> 43:23.299
Could I tempt you to join me
in watching a little film?

43:39.860 --> 43:41.900
-Where's the movie from?
-An acquaintance-

43:41.980 --> 43:45.339
-in
the Norwegian intelligence community.

43:53.420 --> 43:58.139
I guess this right about confirms
our worst case scenario.

43:58.900 --> 44:01.060
Agreed.
