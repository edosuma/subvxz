WEBVTT

00:02.787 --> 00:03.947
T.C.: That was a brutal workout.

00:03.948 --> 00:05.852
I've not been hit that hard in a long time.

00:05.853 --> 00:06.729
It was great for me.

00:06.730 --> 00:09.421
- I can never kick your ass enough.
- Oh, yeah.

00:09.445 --> 00:10.197
- Oh Jordan.
- What?

00:10.221 --> 00:12.108
This is "Smalls," A.K.A.
Colonel Elwood Green,

00:12.132 --> 00:14.306
my group therapy, MMA leader/torturer.

00:14.330 --> 00:16.184
- Oh, hi.
- This... this is Jordan.

00:16.207 --> 00:18.132
Whoa. How'd you end up with him?

00:18.156 --> 00:19.606
- [Chuckles] He got lucky, I guess.
- Oh, come on.

00:19.630 --> 00:20.620
Jordan!

00:20.644 --> 00:21.624
- Yeah.
- I was looking for you.

00:21.648 --> 00:22.277
You have a call.

00:22.672 --> 00:23.662
It was nice to meet you.

00:23.686 --> 00:25.258
Topher: Smalls, Skype video call is ready.

00:25.282 --> 00:26.323
Showtime.

00:26.347 --> 00:27.064
All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:27.088 --> 00:28.038
What's this all about?

00:28.062 --> 00:29.957
I could tell you, but
then I'd have to kill you.

00:29.981 --> 00:31.970
A little patience, Callahan.

00:31.994 --> 00:32.695
Jordan!

00:32.720 --> 00:33.965
[Phone hangs up]

00:33.989 --> 00:36.121
Hey. What do we got?

00:36.145 --> 00:39.110
9-year-old boy... Ethan.
He has a temperature of 101.

00:39.134 --> 00:40.133
He is burning up.

00:40.157 --> 00:41.608
I'm very concerned about his fever.

00:41.632 --> 00:42.317
It hasn't gone down.

00:42.341 --> 00:44.003
Mrs. Edwards, this is Dr. Alexander.

00:44.408 --> 00:46.836
So, he's fine one minute,
and then the next, it's...

00:46.860 --> 00:47.952
- Okay.
- You need to help him.

00:47.976 --> 00:49.286
Okay, we <i> are</i> gonna examine Ethan,

00:49.310 --> 00:50.684
but just so that you know, it's very common

00:50.708 --> 00:51.773
for children to have fevers.

00:51.797 --> 00:54.261
He probably just has a-a-a
virus or something.

00:54.285 --> 00:56.104
I am not concerned about
other people's children.

00:56.128 --> 00:58.294
I'm concerned about mine,
so please tend to him.

00:58.318 --> 00:59.296
Paul, hi, there.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.430
Uh, would you take this
young man into pedes, please?

01:01.454 --> 01:02.727
Uh, sure. What seems to be the issue?

01:02.751 --> 01:05.125
He has a raging fever of 101.

01:05.247 --> 01:06.493
I will be with you shortly.

01:06.610 --> 01:08.816
Okay, in the meantime, I'm
gonna need you to fill out

01:08.840 --> 01:10.886
some paperwork with one of our nurses here.

01:10.910 --> 01:13.457
Uh, Mollie, could you
help Mrs. Edwards, please?

01:13.481 --> 01:15.053
- Okay. Thank you.
- Follow me, ma'am, please.

01:15.077 --> 01:16.298
[Exhales sharply]

01:16.322 --> 01:18.634
- 911 for a fever?
- You should have seen her back at their house.

01:18.658 --> 01:20.215
I told her, "this is not why you call 911."

01:20.239 --> 01:22.028
But she was not having
it. She's a helicopter mom,

01:22.052 --> 01:24.425
so I figured I'd just save
another crew a trip, you know?

01:24.449 --> 01:25.752
- Full moon, right?
- [Laughing] Right.

01:25.776 --> 01:27.842
- Okay, catch you later.
- Topher: All right, everybody,

01:27.866 --> 01:29.446
we just have a few moments for this,

01:29.470 --> 01:31.815
but Smalls has a big surprise for us.

01:31.839 --> 01:34.167
I wanted to thank all of
you for the volunteer work

01:34.191 --> 01:35.637
you've been doing on
the Mobile Vet Centers,

01:35.661 --> 01:37.036
but I got outranked.

01:37.060 --> 01:39.421
There's somebody else here
today that would like to do that.

01:40.973 --> 01:42.542
It's all yours, ladies.

01:42.565 --> 01:44.208
<i>Hey, thank you, Smalls.</i>

01:44.232 --> 01:46.949
<i>Well, hello, San Antonio
Memorial night shift.</i>

01:46.973 --> 01:48.232
<i>How are you guys doing?</i>

01:48.256 --> 01:49.871
[Cheering and whooping]

01:49.895 --> 01:51.168
<i>Well, I know you all are busy</i>

01:51.192 --> 01:52.511
<i>and about to stat your shift,</i>

01:52.535 --> 01:54.549
<i>but Jill and I wanted
to personally thank you</i>

01:54.573 --> 01:56.825
<i>for everything you're doing
to serve this community.</i>

01:56.849 --> 01:58.736
<i>Just from a show of hands,</i>

01:58.760 --> 02:01.599
<i>how many of you are veterans
or married to veterans?</i>

02:01.911 --> 02:03.674
<i>Oh, great. Outstanding.</i>

02:03.705 --> 02:05.860
<i>A-and by the way, we heard from Smalls</i>

02:05.884 --> 02:08.463
<i>about the terrific work you're
doing with our veterans.</i>

02:08.487 --> 02:10.374
<i>Let me tell you,
we're grateful to you</i>

02:10.398 --> 02:12.082
<i>for encouraging your
veteran patients</i>

02:12.106 --> 02:14.277
<i>and their families
to go to Vet Centers.</i>

02:14.301 --> 02:16.248
<i>We're so glad that, if they need it,</i>

02:16.272 --> 02:18.144
<i>the San Antonio Veteran Community</i>

02:18.167 --> 02:21.305
<i>can get the free counseling
and support they have earned.</i>

02:21.329 --> 02:22.936
We're big believers in counseling

02:22.960 --> 02:24.375
and know how much it can help.

02:24.399 --> 02:27.680
<i>Well, we're both so
proud of all of you</i>

02:27.704 --> 02:29.878
<i>for being a driving
force behind this work.</i>

02:29.902 --> 02:32.275
<i>So thanks again. Keep
up the great work.</i>

02:32.299 --> 02:34.943
<i>And now we're gonna let you
get started with your shift.</i>

02:34.966 --> 02:37.071
Together: Thank you. <i>All
right, guy, take it easy.</i>

02:37.095 --> 02:40.113
[Applause] T.C., there's been an
accident at a construction site.

02:40.137 --> 02:42.031
- They need you there stat.
- On it.

02:42.055 --> 02:45.034
Thanks for arranging
that. It's a huge thrill.

02:45.059 --> 02:45.650
Yeah.

02:45.673 --> 02:47.957
And thanks for helping T.C. in group.

02:47.981 --> 02:49.396
It's made a big difference for him.

02:49.420 --> 02:51.590
You know, he still has
some things to work through,

02:51.614 --> 02:53.148
- but he'll get there.
- Yeah.

02:53.172 --> 02:55.187
Right, okay, so, your
fever still hasn't broken,

02:55.211 --> 02:57.297
- so we're gonna give you some more, uh...
- But where's my mom?

02:57.321 --> 02:58.686
Well, she's with Dr. Alexander.

02:58.710 --> 02:59.526
I want to see her now.

02:59.550 --> 03:01.051
Okay, Ethan, it's all right.

03:01.075 --> 03:03.457
It's not all right.
I <i> need</i> to see her.

03:03.481 --> 03:05.527
Okay, yeah, I'll... I'll
bring her to you, okay?

03:05.551 --> 03:08.142
But listen... I need you to
I need you to pee for me...

03:08.166 --> 03:09.993
I told you. I don't have to go!

03:10.017 --> 03:11.341
I want my mom!

03:12.166 --> 03:13.447
Uh, okay.

03:13.471 --> 03:15.174
Yeah. Okay.

03:15.197 --> 03:16.114
Hey.

03:16.138 --> 03:17.577
So, Scott is still on leave, huh?

03:17.601 --> 03:18.719
Yeah, at least another day.

03:18.743 --> 03:20.117
Family's getting ready to sue him.

03:20.141 --> 03:21.389
And to make matters worse,

03:21.413 --> 03:24.041
it looks like the D.A. is considering
to charge him with reckless driving.

03:24.065 --> 03:25.959
I just talked to him,
and he's a total mess.

03:26.260 --> 03:27.722
He feels terrible about the kid.

03:27.746 --> 03:29.488
I just examined a teenager

03:29.512 --> 03:31.679
who was wearing a necklace
made of squirrel parts.

03:31.703 --> 03:32.451
[Laughs]

03:32.475 --> 03:34.489
He had it all chained
together as a necklace,

03:34.513 --> 03:36.154
wanted to know if it would give him AIDS.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.307
That's kind of freaky, huh?

03:37.331 --> 03:38.798
I don't know. On a
Full-moon Saturday night?

03:38.821 --> 03:39.947
I mean, that's nothing.

03:39.971 --> 03:41.371
It's gonna get a lot freakier tonight.

03:41.395 --> 03:42.633
Yeah, that might be the
most conventional thing

03:42.656 --> 03:43.839
you see all night, by the way.

03:43.863 --> 03:45.646
Yeah, but I thought all this
full-moon, crazy stuff...

03:45.670 --> 03:47.268
I don't care what the research says, okay?

03:47.292 --> 03:49.309
My experience tells me
it's gonna get nuts in here.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.141
It sounds like we have the
makings of a bet tonight.

03:51.165 --> 03:52.217
Okay, how about this?

03:52.241 --> 03:54.496
You three, 100 bucks a pop,

03:54.520 --> 03:55.615
weirdest case, winner takes all?

03:55.639 --> 03:56.597
- All right.
- All right.

03:56.632 --> 03:57.634
- Yeah.
- Cool?

03:57.658 --> 03:58.904
Okay, okay, okay!

03:58.928 --> 04:00.110
All right, I'm the judge.

04:00.439 --> 04:03.478
Weirdest case, 10 points,
1 point for the least.

04:03.502 --> 04:05.937
Whoever has the weirdest
case by the morning

04:05.961 --> 04:07.687
takes the pot and bragging rights.

04:07.711 --> 04:08.297
Deal?

04:08.321 --> 04:09.405
- Okay.
- Deal.

04:09.429 --> 04:09.810
Deal.

04:09.834 --> 04:10.834
Good luck to you all.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.338
You the doc?

04:16.362 --> 04:18.627
Yeah. What do we got?

04:18.651 --> 04:19.834
The lift collapsed the scaffolding

04:19.858 --> 04:21.094
- and landed on Carlos.
- All right.

04:21.117 --> 04:22.395
The paramedics just took him away.

04:22.419 --> 04:24.529
Walt tried to get to him, but
he's pinned under the pipes.

04:24.553 --> 04:26.666
[Walt groaning]

04:26.690 --> 04:29.009
Okay, I'm Dr. Callahan.
I'm gonna take care of you.

04:29.033 --> 04:30.197
How's Carlos? Is he okay?

04:30.221 --> 04:32.101
Serious. He's being
transferred to the hospital.

04:32.152 --> 04:33.582
- Okay.
- Aah!

04:33.605 --> 04:35.124
Hold still. Hold still. No, I-I tried...

04:35.148 --> 04:37.731
I tried to help him, but the
scaffolding was all over...

04:37.754 --> 04:39.779
- I'm sure you did.
- You know, the look on his face

04:39.803 --> 04:42.137
when it started falling on
him... I tried to get to him.

04:42.161 --> 04:43.073
I'm sure you did whatever you could.

04:43.097 --> 04:44.084
Look, we got to get this thing off.

04:44.108 --> 04:46.159
You boys ready? Okay. Come on.

04:46.183 --> 04:47.022
[Men straining]

04:47.046 --> 04:48.803
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh.

04:48.804 --> 04:50.303
Here we go. Okay.

04:50.327 --> 04:51.999
Hey, it could have been
much worse, all right?

04:52.023 --> 04:54.671
Okay, we got an open fracture
and a dislocated ankle.

04:55.035 --> 04:56.671
All right, I got to reset the ankle,

04:56.695 --> 04:58.143
get the blood flow back into the foot.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.164
If I don't, you could lose it.

04:59.188 --> 05:00.303
- Do what you got to do.
- Okay.

05:00.327 --> 05:01.284
I'm gonna give you some pain meds.

05:01.308 --> 05:03.255
Uh, no, don't. I can't have any.

05:03.279 --> 05:05.226
- You in recovery?
- No. I'm on parole.

05:05.250 --> 05:07.392
If I put anything in my system,
they're gonna send me back.

05:07.415 --> 05:09.249
Hey, it's... it's cool. I'll call
your parole officer, no problem.

05:09.273 --> 05:11.255
Yeah, and if you forget,
I'm back in the joint.

05:11.279 --> 05:13.475
Like I said, you just do
whatever you got to do.

05:13.499 --> 05:14.815
Okay. Your call.

05:15.521 --> 05:17.567
All right. You ready for this?

05:17.591 --> 05:18.645
On "three."

05:18.669 --> 05:20.915
- One, three.
- Ohh!

05:20.939 --> 05:22.503
There we go. [Groans]

05:22.527 --> 05:23.200
You're good.

05:23.224 --> 05:25.449
***

05:25.473 --> 05:27.647
I'm telling you, he is
perfectly fine one minute,

05:27.671 --> 05:28.977
and then the next he is burning up.

05:29.001 --> 05:30.572
All right, well, we're
gonna run some tests,

05:30.596 --> 05:31.746
and we are starting him on fluids.

05:31.770 --> 05:33.017
I'm actually feeling better, mom.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.461
His temp is still hovering around 101.

05:34.485 --> 05:35.743
Well, that's not better. That's the same.

05:35.767 --> 05:37.623
And, baby, you may think you're
feeling better, but you're not.

05:37.647 --> 05:40.096
Ethan, can you tell us where else
you're feeling some discomfort?

05:40.120 --> 05:41.816
- Kind of feel like I have a...
- He's got headaches.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.375
He also has this sort of
sweating that's happening,

05:43.399 --> 05:44.785
- and then it...
- Mrs. Edwards, I think it would be best

05:44.809 --> 05:46.227
if Ethan could answer these questions.

05:46.251 --> 05:47.424
Well, he tells me everything,

05:47.448 --> 05:49.900
and I really don't want to t-tax...

05:49.924 --> 05:50.777
Mom!

05:50.801 --> 05:52.380
Oh! Oh, my gosh!

05:52.404 --> 05:53.271
Ugh!

05:53.295 --> 05:54.253
Are you all right?

05:54.277 --> 05:56.612
Oh. Oh. Let's get you seated.

05:56.637 --> 05:57.423
Are you okay, mom?

05:57.446 --> 05:58.660
Okay. I'm all right.

05:58.684 --> 06:00.666
Sh-she'll be fine.
Mrs. Edwards, I'm just gonna...

Where's Carlos? How's he doing?

06:21.770 --> 06:22.967
- You got to find out for me.
- Kenny?

06:22.991 --> 06:24.615
- Sorry, brother. He didn't make it.
- Ah!

06:24.639 --> 06:26.077
Dr. Zia's talking to his wife now.

06:26.100 --> 06:29.401
Lois, I-I tried to do
everything to help him.

06:29.426 --> 06:31.216
I did! I tried! You got
to explain it to her.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.561
I tried to help him. I was there.

06:32.688 --> 06:33.806
Okay.

06:34.058 --> 06:35.976
I didn't want to talk in front of Ethan,

but I'm very, very sorry that
we got off on the wrong foot.

06:38.219 --> 06:39.346
That's okay.

06:40.365 --> 06:42.939
Look, Mrs. Edwards, um,
is there something going on

06:42.963 --> 06:44.113
that I should know about?

06:44.137 --> 06:45.735
No. [Chuckles nervously]

06:45.759 --> 06:47.250
Well, there's always
something going on with me.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.895
I just have a very high-stress,
very high-strung personality.

06:49.919 --> 06:51.364
And my doctor has me on Xanax,

06:51.388 --> 06:53.114
and I've been trying to get off of it.

06:53.138 --> 06:54.855
So, I guess, lesson learned. [Chuckles]

06:54.879 --> 06:56.661
Well, that shouldn't cause fainting, so...

06:56.685 --> 06:58.154
Well, I didn't faint, actually.

06:58.178 --> 06:59.951
I was dizzy, and I lost my balance.

06:59.975 --> 07:02.616
Um... I have vertigo.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.790
So, I was in a car
accident several years ago,

07:04.814 --> 07:06.229
and it's one of the residual effects,

07:06.253 --> 07:07.985
that and the eye thing.

07:08.009 --> 07:08.717
Okay.

07:08.740 --> 07:10.017
I'm just a bit of a mess.

07:10.041 --> 07:12.198
Look, thank you for telling me all that.

07:12.222 --> 07:14.840
Now, you took a pretty big shot,

07:14.864 --> 07:16.846
so I would like to get a scan of your head.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.148
No. No. God, no.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.802
Um, I'm fine, but if you
would just look after my son.

07:20.927 --> 07:22.873
Dr. Cummings is gonna run
all the tests on Ethan,

07:22.897 --> 07:24.354
and we will get his fever down and I...

07:24.378 --> 07:27.139
Okay. I am just gonna
e-mail my husband first

07:27.163 --> 07:29.942
because he's on a plane and he
touches down in 90 minutes...

07:29.966 --> 07:31.276
It's okay. Take your time, all right?

07:31.300 --> 07:32.770
Okay. Thank you.

07:32.794 --> 07:34.287
[Sighs]

07:34.399 --> 07:38.602
Man, I can't believe Carlos is dead.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.000
It's not right.

07:40.115 --> 07:41.479
Were you guys close?

07:42.408 --> 07:44.357
Gonna be.

07:46.637 --> 07:49.976
Met him month and a half ago at church.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.276
He got me the job, really
stuck his neck out for me,

07:53.300 --> 07:54.474
'cause I can tell you...

07:54.498 --> 07:58.511
most places they don't
want to take on no ex-cons.

07:58.535 --> 08:00.134
I can imagine.

08:00.158 --> 08:01.947
How long were you in for?

08:03.718 --> 08:05.313
16 years.

08:07.792 --> 08:09.340
Just got out 3 months ago.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.698
And I didn't kill anybody, if
that's what you're wondering.

08:11.808 --> 08:12.899
I wasn't.

08:12.923 --> 08:14.367
Yeah. A lot of people do wonder.

08:14.683 --> 08:16.376
They get scared when they find out

08:16.400 --> 08:17.806
that somebody's been to prison,

08:17.846 --> 08:19.095
think I'm some kind of killer.

08:19.119 --> 08:20.885
Excuse me, Tee. When you have a second?

08:20.909 --> 08:22.572
Hey, weren't you Carlos' doctor?

08:23.216 --> 08:25.790
Uh, yes, sir. I was.

08:25.814 --> 08:27.229
So, did he suffer?

08:28.970 --> 08:30.606
I-I'm sorry, sir.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.722
He... he was D.O.A. at the site.

08:33.224 --> 08:34.736
We... we did everything we could.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.998
Would you like to talk to his wife... Lois?

08:38.032 --> 08:39.118
'Cause she's still here.

08:39.150 --> 08:40.238
No.

08:40.272 --> 08:41.741
I'm sorry?

08:41.775 --> 08:43.384
I said no! I don't want
to talk to her, okay?

08:43.408 --> 08:44.782
She just lost her husband.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.446
So, I'm sorry, but I j...

08:47.181 --> 08:49.291
Can you just give me a minute?

08:49.315 --> 08:50.315
Of course.

08:50.465 --> 08:53.056
***

08:54.761 --> 08:55.942
The reason I came in...

08:55.966 --> 08:58.040
Ali's been moved up the transplant list.

08:58.064 --> 09:00.056
The Embassy in Kabul has his VISA,

09:00.080 --> 09:01.570
so I'm gonna Skype him
later and let him know.

09:01.594 --> 09:02.739
- That's great.
- Yeah.

09:02.763 --> 09:05.017
So, it looks like I'm gonna
go sooner than expected,

09:05.041 --> 09:06.341
maybe about a week.

09:06.365 --> 09:07.998
Topher, I will go with you if you want.

09:08.022 --> 09:08.980
Just say the word.

09:09.004 --> 09:10.216
I know. I know you would.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.024
Jordan would kill both of us.

09:12.048 --> 09:13.934
She's already yelling at me for going.

09:15.147 --> 09:16.842
Ali saved your life.

09:17.175 --> 09:18.933
There's only one way you can pay him back.

09:18.957 --> 09:20.012
I know.

09:20.036 --> 09:21.506
Well, wives and pregnant girlfriends

09:21.530 --> 09:22.489
don't always understand that.

09:22.513 --> 09:24.408
- No. [Chuckles]
- I'll go get Ali.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.635
Be back before you know it.

09:25.659 --> 09:26.659
- Okay.
- All right.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.737
[Indistinct speaking over P.A.]

09:30.761 --> 09:31.990
Wait. What is it, a tumor?

09:32.014 --> 09:33.766
No. Fortunately.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.826
Some knucklehead teen had a contest

09:35.850 --> 09:37.452
to see how many sunflower
seeds he could eat.

09:37.476 --> 09:40.225
So, 10 days later, ix-nay on the poo-pay.

09:40.249 --> 09:42.007
No bowel movement, so his
parents brought him in.

09:42.031 --> 09:43.468
- Not bad.
- Please.

09:43.492 --> 09:45.626
I just pulled a cockroach
out of a patient's ear.

09:45.650 --> 09:48.211
- Who cares? That's nothing.
- Oh, then he <i> ate</i> it.

09:48.688 --> 09:50.280
- Now, that's something.
- Yes.

09:50.304 --> 09:52.350
Okay, uh, let's see...
6 points for Krista...

09:52.374 --> 09:53.973
- Oh!
- 5 1/2 for Drew.

09:53.997 --> 09:56.879
My good friend Ragosa is
still in the lead with 6 1/2

09:56.903 --> 09:58.169
with the squirrel necklace, my friends.

09:58.193 --> 09:59.210
I should get more points.

09:59.242 --> 10:00.971
- Me too.
- I have ruled.

10:00.995 --> 10:02.518
Move on to your next patients.

10:02.693 --> 10:04.191
All right, his pressure dropped,

10:04.215 --> 10:06.069
he became altered and
completely soaked himself.

10:06.093 --> 10:07.499
[Monitor beeping rapidly]

10:07.523 --> 10:08.254
He's septic.

10:08.278 --> 10:11.624
Hang a gram of Ceftriaxone
and bolus 300 cc of saline.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.095
His weight count is 19,000.

10:15.119 --> 10:16.810
What did his chest and urinalysis say?

10:16.834 --> 10:18.998
His chest X-ray is clear,
but we didn't do a urine.

10:19.022 --> 10:20.879
- He wouldn't pee.
- Wouldn't or couldn't?

10:20.903 --> 10:23.021
He said he didn't have to.
I-I gave him fluids to help.

10:23.045 --> 10:26.147
Look, Walt, uh... I think
you may need surgery.

10:26.171 --> 10:27.512
- Surgery?
- Mm-hmm.

10:27.536 --> 10:29.123
I can't have surgery. I have to work.

10:29.147 --> 10:30.457
I want to go back to work tomorrow.

10:30.481 --> 10:31.631
Well, that's not gonna happen

10:31.655 --> 10:32.680
'cause you're gonna be on crutches.

10:32.704 --> 10:33.933
No, you don't understand.

10:33.956 --> 10:35.460
You know, I can't be off that long.

10:35.484 --> 10:36.882
I'll lose my job. Everything
hinges on that job.

10:36.906 --> 10:38.179
Well, look, you got workmen's comp

10:38.203 --> 10:39.647
or something to help you get by, right?

10:39.671 --> 10:40.912
I'm not talking about getting by.

10:40.936 --> 10:44.106
I'm saving up so I can send
my boy some money for college.

10:44.130 --> 10:45.529
He's graduating high school in a month,

10:45.553 --> 10:47.070
and I need to show him that I've changed.

10:47.094 --> 10:48.473
- Walt...
- No, Doc!

10:49.598 --> 10:51.553
This is not gonna happen.
I'm not having surgery.

10:51.577 --> 10:52.834
I'm just gonna limp along.

10:52.858 --> 10:54.175
Let's just run the test, and then we can...

10:54.199 --> 10:54.886
No. Ow!

10:54.911 --> 10:57.450
Damn! Aah! It just gave out on me.

10:57.474 --> 10:59.570
Yeah, I told you, your ankle's
barely hanging onto your leg.

10:59.594 --> 11:00.671
I'm not talking about <i> that</i> leg.

11:00.695 --> 11:02.290
I'm talking about the
other one, my good one!

11:02.314 --> 11:03.159
It just gave out on me.

11:03.183 --> 11:04.429
- Said your good one?
- Yeah.

11:04.453 --> 11:06.179
- Do you feel this?
- No.

11:06.203 --> 11:07.754
Okay. What... what about this?

11:07.778 --> 11:09.814
No, nothing.

11:09.838 --> 11:12.242
I can't feel anything.
I can't stand up on it.

11:12.266 --> 11:14.002
Now, what the hell is going on?

11:14.026 --> 11:17.460
***

11:21.673 --> 11:23.080
[Monitor beeping]

11:23.500 --> 11:24.970
I-I'm sorry.

11:24.994 --> 11:26.274
Come here. I got you. I got you.

11:26.539 --> 11:28.282
I'm sorry.

11:28.306 --> 11:30.028
Please don't tell my mom I wet myself.

11:30.052 --> 11:31.685
- I-I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

11:31.709 --> 11:33.286
Ethan, no one's gonna be mad
at you, all right? It's okay.

11:33.310 --> 11:34.434
But my mom will get upset,

11:34.458 --> 11:35.993
and she doesn't handle that well.

11:36.017 --> 11:36.765
Just curious...

11:36.789 --> 11:39.231
what does your mom do when she gets upset?

11:39.255 --> 11:42.084
She just... I don't want to talk about it.

11:42.108 --> 11:44.795
I-I'm tired and I don't feel well.

11:50.442 --> 11:51.880
This doesn't sound good.

11:51.914 --> 11:53.704
No. It doesn't.

11:53.738 --> 11:55.720
Look, I need to talk to the mother.

11:55.754 --> 11:57.992
I'm getting a picture here I don't like.

11:59.082 --> 12:00.456
What about the leg weakness?

12:00.490 --> 12:02.376
When was the first time you noticed that?

12:02.410 --> 12:05.122
Is it new, or is it the
same as the hand weakness?

12:05.146 --> 12:08.049
Hey, man, I can't help
you if you don't tell me.

12:08.657 --> 12:11.790
Tonight was the first time.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.516
Okay. So, just now?

12:17.566 --> 12:18.677
No.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.997
If I told you something,

12:21.020 --> 12:23.874
we still have doctor-patient
confidentiality, right?

12:23.898 --> 12:26.463
Yeah, of course, 100%.

12:28.028 --> 12:30.414
Carlos and I

12:30.438 --> 12:32.792
were always playing around, you know?

12:33.257 --> 12:35.382
Sure. We were friends.

12:40.405 --> 12:42.962
And I stepped in front
of him just as a joke

12:42.986 --> 12:44.488
as he was driving by.

12:44.512 --> 12:46.174
And I was just kidding around.

12:46.198 --> 12:47.177
And...

12:47.201 --> 12:50.919
I tried to move, and I couldn't.

12:50.943 --> 12:54.079
And my legs were stuck in cement.

12:54.103 --> 12:57.758
It was like I fell down and
he swerved to avoid me...

13:00.601 --> 13:02.938
[Voice breaking] And he
ran into the scaffolding.

13:03.331 --> 13:04.929
I killed him!

13:04.953 --> 13:08.133
I can't help but believe
that I'm the only one

13:08.157 --> 13:10.413
who's responsible for
killing my best friend.

Jordan: Okay, so, you're
sure there's no evidence

13:17.331 --> 13:18.288
of an obstructing stone?

13:18.312 --> 13:20.362
Yeah. The renal ultrasound
shows the hydronephrosis,

13:20.386 --> 13:22.416
- but no reflux or stone.
- [Sighs]

13:22.448 --> 13:23.323
Um, have you talked to the mom

13:23.347 --> 13:24.592
about why Ethan's so afraid of her?

13:24.616 --> 13:26.183
No. She went to meet her husband...

13:26.207 --> 13:27.422
[elevator bell dings] Um...

13:27.901 --> 13:30.305
- Actually, here they are.
- Hi.

13:30.329 --> 13:31.735
David: Good evening, Doctors. I'm David.

13:31.759 --> 13:33.288
- I'm Ethan's fa...
- They said that the antibiotics would help,

13:33.312 --> 13:35.072
- so why is he getting worse?
- Baby.

13:35.095 --> 13:37.169
Look, I'm sorry. I just
took a cab straight here.

13:37.193 --> 13:37.881
Can you catch me up?

13:37.905 --> 13:39.716
Yes. We think that Ethan
has a kidney infection

13:39.740 --> 13:40.495
due to a blockage,

13:40.519 --> 13:41.912
but he doesn't have any
of the common causes,

13:41.936 --> 13:43.627
so we have him on potent antibiotics.

13:43.651 --> 13:44.699
Which take some time...

13:44.723 --> 13:45.553
You said that hours ago.

13:45.577 --> 13:46.650
Okay. Paul, why don't you

13:46.674 --> 13:47.890
take Mrs. Edwards in to see Ethan?

13:47.914 --> 13:48.951
I think he would like that.

13:48.975 --> 13:50.078
- All right, sure.
- This way, please.

13:50.102 --> 13:51.247
Yes. And I'll fill you in.

13:52.093 --> 13:53.780
Okay, we need to talk about your wife.

13:53.804 --> 13:55.992
All right, so, Ragosa is still ahead.

13:56.279 --> 13:57.493
It's been a bit of a slow night,

13:57.517 --> 13:59.039
but I'm sure things will
pick up after the bars close.

13:59.063 --> 14:02.581
Well, they better because, um,
we're not losing to the noob.

14:02.605 --> 14:03.978
Yeah, that's a fact, Jack.

14:04.002 --> 14:06.240
You understand? You will not win.

14:06.264 --> 14:09.005
Mm-hmm. You two are feeling
a little confident, huh?

14:09.029 --> 14:09.979
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:10.003 --> 14:11.635
How about a little side wager?

14:11.658 --> 14:12.743
Bring it on.

14:12.767 --> 14:15.103

the other two's cars.

- Fine.
- Fine. Pbht!

14:18.516 --> 14:19.727
A little spit shine will be nice.

14:19.751 --> 14:21.342
Thank you. Thank you.

14:21.366 --> 14:24.219
You know, whatever happened
out there with your leg,

14:24.602 --> 14:25.752
you couldn't control that.

14:25.776 --> 14:27.122
I shouldn't have been messing around.

14:27.146 --> 14:28.530
Hey, he was playing around, too.

14:28.554 --> 14:30.074
You said you guys did it all the time.

14:30.346 --> 14:32.074
So it wasn't your fault.

14:32.098 --> 14:33.595
Well, you're a smart man, Doc,

14:33.619 --> 14:35.505
but unless you ever felt responsible

14:35.529 --> 14:36.936

Well, I have.

No. Afghanistan.

14:43.001 --> 14:44.295
Someone close?

14:44.319 --> 14:46.025
Yeah, very.

14:47.184 --> 14:48.530
You don't like talking about it?

14:48.554 --> 14:49.481
Nope.

14:49.505 --> 14:50.559
In my group.

14:50.583 --> 14:51.925
Oh, good for you. Yep.

14:51.949 --> 14:55.371
I thought therapy was B.S.,

14:55.395 --> 14:58.049
bunch of guys sitting around whining.

14:58.073 --> 14:59.575
I mean, I thought it was weak.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.743
Yeah. Me too.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.001
I was wrong.

15:03.209 --> 15:04.614
You know what I learned

15:04.649 --> 15:06.283
listening to all those stories

15:06.307 --> 15:08.675
about who's the toughest and the baddest?

15:08.699 --> 15:10.687
That you weren't the
toughest and the baddest?

15:10.711 --> 15:11.460
Exactly.

15:11.484 --> 15:13.170
I thought I was tough. I wasn't tough.

15:13.213 --> 15:16.277
I was a coward. I took the easy road.

15:16.301 --> 15:18.348
You know what kind of man I am?

15:19.218 --> 15:20.074
No.

15:20.098 --> 15:21.801
The kind who would walk out on his kid.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.117
You got any?

15:26.141 --> 15:27.556
No, not yet.

15:27.580 --> 15:30.012
Well, when you do, don't mess it up.

15:30.036 --> 15:30.672
I wan't.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.507
I mean, you got to be there for them.

15:32.531 --> 15:33.698
Hey. I will.

15:33.722 --> 15:34.968
Yeah, easier said than done.

15:34.992 --> 15:36.581
Life can pull you in ways
you wouldn't even expect.

15:36.605 --> 15:37.332
Ow!

15:37.356 --> 15:39.685
- Your ankle hurting again?
- Yeah, a bit.

15:40.009 --> 15:42.258
I'll get you some ibuprofen.

15:42.431 --> 15:45.135
Here, take this. Help you with the pain.

15:45.159 --> 15:46.573
Mm.

15:46.721 --> 15:47.807
[Gags]

15:47.831 --> 15:50.706
- Hey. You okay?
- Sorry.

15:50.730 --> 15:53.361
I was having a problem swallowing.

15:53.385 --> 15:54.639
That h-happens sometimes.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.364
It's not the first time, right?

15:56.388 --> 15:58.402
You have this with food, too?

15:58.727 --> 16:01.667
Yeah. I mean, no, it's not the first time,

16:01.691 --> 16:03.609
and, yeah, sometimes with food.

16:04.494 --> 16:05.860
Is that bad?

16:07.414 --> 16:11.312
Ali? Ali, can you see or hear me?

16:11.336 --> 16:12.322
I'm losing you.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.719
[ <i> Weakly</i> ] <i> Yeah, Topher,</i>
<i>I can... I can hear you.</i>

[Chuckles] <i>Let me adjust my device.</i>

16:16.645 --> 16:18.060
Okay.

16:18.084 --> 16:21.801
[ <i> Breathing heavily</i> ]

16:23.692 --> 16:26.282
A-Ali, w-what's been happening?

16:26.436 --> 16:30.178
<i>I-I haven't been feeling well lately.</i>

16:30.370 --> 16:32.733
<i>I might have a cold or... or flu.</i>

16:32.757 --> 16:34.172
Yeah, okay.

16:34.196 --> 16:37.168
Listen, I-I'm gonna get
back to you tomorrow with...

16:37.192 --> 16:39.078
with all the details of your trip,

16:39.102 --> 16:41.083
and I'm gonna give the aid worker

16:41.114 --> 16:43.117
a list of some meds to get for you

16:43.140 --> 16:45.018
so you can feel a lot better, okay?

16:45.042 --> 16:46.928
<i>Okay. Thank you, Topher.</i>

16:47.069 --> 16:50.426
I c... I can't wait to
see you, Ali, in Dubai.

16:50.450 --> 16:51.125
<i>Me too.</i>

16:51.149 --> 16:51.980
I miss you.

16:52.004 --> 16:52.898
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:52.922 --> 16:54.520
Take care, okay?

16:54.544 --> 16:56.182
<i>Okay. Goodbye.</i>

16:56.206 --> 16:58.485
[Computer powers down]

16:58.605 --> 17:00.363
So, that was Ali.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.624
Yeah. Yeah.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.740
He didn't look too good, Tophe.

17:04.803 --> 17:07.233
You think he's gonna make it to Dubai?

17:07.708 --> 17:10.906
You know, not... not without an LVAD

17:10.930 --> 17:12.186
to bridge him to a transplant.

17:12.211 --> 17:13.137
If he doesn't get that,

17:13.161 --> 17:15.048
he's not... he's not gonna make it.

17:15.071 --> 17:17.061
He didn't realize.

17:17.231 --> 17:22.574
***

17:24.710 --> 17:26.924
Okay. So, look, I think that
Walt's issue could be neuro.

17:26.948 --> 17:28.138
It could be from the pipe falling on him

17:28.163 --> 17:29.643
'cause he took a pretty
good bruising on his spine.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.083
Could be a pre-existing problem, too.

17:31.107 --> 17:33.451
Try a nerve conduction
test and get a baseline

17:33.475 --> 17:34.735
to see if the wiring in his
nervous system's working.

17:34.759 --> 17:35.973
[Sighs] Yeah, yeah, good idea.

17:35.997 --> 17:37.915
After being in prison that
long, he could have all sorts

17:37.939 --> 17:39.568
of issues that were never addressed.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.352
Yeah. He's had a pretty messed-up life,

17:41.376 --> 17:42.695
but, you know, I got to give him credit.

17:42.719 --> 17:43.990
He owns all his dumb decisions.

17:44.014 --> 17:46.200
Hey, did... did Smalls get back to you

17:46.224 --> 17:48.500
about whether they can get Ali
to Kabul or to an American base?

17:48.524 --> 17:50.622
'Cause he is pretty well-connected
with the security firms.

17:50.646 --> 17:52.973
Uh, he's making calls, but
I-I-I got to say, I'm...

17:52.997 --> 17:55.229
I'm freaking out here 'cause
Ali's running out of time.

17:55.253 --> 17:57.106
You should have seen
him... did not look good.

17:57.130 --> 17:59.049
Tophe, we'll just keep
working our contacts.

17:59.073 --> 18:00.810
- I know.
- We both got calls and e-mails to Joey.

18:00.834 --> 18:02.406
Maybe he can get a Doctors
Without Borders team in there.

18:02.430 --> 18:03.548
Your lips to God's ears.

18:03.572 --> 18:05.313
I got to go. My patient's in the bay.

18:05.581 --> 18:08.340
Yeah, she's flighty, but that's all.

18:08.364 --> 18:09.756
There is no way that she would...

18:09.780 --> 18:10.832
- Okay.
- [Sighs]

18:10.856 --> 18:14.492
Okay, but he was legitimately
afraid of her finding out.

18:14.516 --> 18:17.054
Well, that is probably because
of the bed-wetting issue.

18:17.078 --> 18:18.078
The bed-wetting issue?

18:18.742 --> 18:21.466
Okay, she didn't mention
anything about that.

18:21.490 --> 18:22.672
[Sighs] Yeah, it's...

18:22.696 --> 18:24.291
you know, it's sort of
a thing between them.

18:24.315 --> 18:26.521
You know, she... she takes it personally

18:26.545 --> 18:28.098
because she can't just solve it.

18:28.122 --> 18:30.136
Well, it doesn't exactly work like that.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.271
And then she gets upset
because feels like a failure,

18:32.295 --> 18:33.844
and it's like a cycle.

18:33.996 --> 18:36.027
She's been to therapists about it.

18:36.051 --> 18:37.105
Yeah, she did mention

18:37.129 --> 18:38.424
that she was taking some medication.

18:38.448 --> 18:40.198
She's trying. She really is.

18:40.802 --> 18:42.917
But the... the shrink... he says

18:42.941 --> 18:45.217
that the... the right medication
is an art, not a science.

18:45.241 --> 18:46.342
Yeah. You know, I just...

18:46.367 --> 18:48.259
I travel so much for my job
that I'm not there a lot,

18:48.283 --> 18:50.553
and I-I-I-I don't really
know everything that goes on.

18:51.010 --> 18:53.280
Okay. Okay, Mr. Edwards,

18:53.304 --> 18:55.176
thank you for filling
in some of the blanks.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.692
And, look, we will get to the bottom

18:56.716 --> 18:58.378
of Ethan's medical problems, okay?

18:58.402 --> 18:59.958
Thank you.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.602
- Whoa.
- Oh.

19:02.626 --> 19:04.073
Um, sir, I just need my colleagues

19:04.097 --> 19:05.127
to confirm my diagnosis.

19:05.452 --> 19:07.754
So, this gentleman attempted
to impress his girlfriend

19:07.778 --> 19:10.595
by kissing a rattlesnake on the lips.

19:10.619 --> 19:12.398
Now, rattlesnake envenomation occurs

19:12.422 --> 19:14.276
in 75% of all rattlesnake bites,

19:14.300 --> 19:16.602
which means, sir, you are
very lucky to be alive.

19:17.419 --> 19:19.303
Would you gentlemen concur?

19:19.557 --> 19:20.771
We concur.

19:20.795 --> 19:22.009
Yeah. I thought you might.

19:22.392 --> 19:24.373
And if I were you, I'd get
yourself a new girlfriend.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.397
That's my advice.

19:26.260 --> 19:27.822
[Sighs]

19:27.846 --> 19:29.156
We have a new leader.

19:29.242 --> 19:30.986
That's definitely an 8.5.

19:31.010 --> 19:33.022
Hey, and with Drew's werewolf last hour,

19:33.046 --> 19:34.794
- that puts you in last place, Michael.
- [Sighs]

19:34.818 --> 19:35.960
Ooh!

19:35.984 --> 19:37.983
- I'm gonna get my truck extra dirty for you.
- Oh.

19:38.007 --> 19:38.928
My neighbor's got triplets.

19:38.952 --> 19:40.614
I'm gonna let them eat chocolate
in the front seat all day.

19:40.638 --> 19:41.827
- Mm-hmm.
- Have fun with that.

19:41.851 --> 19:43.430
- Oh, man.
- Uh, h-hold on a second.

19:43.454 --> 19:44.454
Yo?

19:44.994 --> 19:48.205
I got, uh, $40 for the next crazy patient.

[Knock on door]

19:50.416 --> 19:51.503
Hey.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.024
So, what is it?

19:57.057 --> 19:59.680
I can tell on your face it ain't good.

19:59.714 --> 20:01.152
It's not great.

20:01.176 --> 20:03.466
Um, based off the results of your EMG

20:03.490 --> 20:05.216
and, uh, the numbness in your legs,

20:05.240 --> 20:08.230
the weakness in your hands,
and difficulty swallowing and...

20:08.254 --> 20:09.370
Just say it, would you?

20:10.254 --> 20:12.224
You have A.L.S.

20:13.452 --> 20:14.688
Whoa.

20:14.722 --> 20:16.232
[Scoffs]

20:17.253 --> 20:20.194
What? It's that ice-bucket thing?

20:20.218 --> 20:22.039
Yes, the ice-bucket thing.

20:22.063 --> 20:24.466
So I'm gonna be laid up like
this for the rest of my life?

20:24.674 --> 20:25.920
I'm not gonna be able to work?

20:27.450 --> 20:30.655
The thing is, Walt, with A.L.S.,

20:31.436 --> 20:33.194
once the symptoms start,

20:33.218 --> 20:36.610
the life expectancy is
maybe one to two years,

20:36.634 --> 20:41.056
and based off your symptoms,
you've probably had it a while.

20:41.090 --> 20:42.496
[Breathes deeply]

20:42.530 --> 20:43.616
I'm sorry.

20:45.095 --> 20:47.252
I don't understand.

20:47.276 --> 20:48.586
I can feel my leg now.

20:48.610 --> 20:50.001
- Look, I can move it.
- No, I...

20:50.025 --> 20:52.014
So, just like maybe what you said...

20:52.038 --> 20:54.361
I, um, hurt my spine in
the fall or something?

20:54.385 --> 20:55.887
Look, I-I wish it was, but, um...

20:56.033 --> 20:58.198
look, I-I consulted a neurologist.

20:58.222 --> 21:00.620
We reviewed the tests. He concurred.

21:01.195 --> 21:02.761
You have A.L.S.

21:02.785 --> 21:04.672
So I was right.

21:04.705 --> 21:06.752
Carlos died because of me,
because I couldn't move.

21:06.785 --> 21:08.777
No. Hey, hey, hey, Walt,
you couldn't help that.

21:08.801 --> 21:11.071
Oh, yeah, I couldn't help anything, can I?

21:11.688 --> 21:15.752
All I wanted was to work,
make money for my boy.

21:16.354 --> 21:18.943
The truth is, I was thinking

21:18.978 --> 21:22.239
about going up there
to see him... Graduate.

21:22.273 --> 21:23.897
Maybe you can still do that.

21:23.921 --> 21:26.447
Yeah, and show up empty-handed
after all these years.

21:26.603 --> 21:28.500
Yeah, that would make a great impression.

21:29.660 --> 21:32.713
I should have swallowed my pride

21:32.737 --> 21:36.335
and told that boy every chance
I had how much I loved him.

21:39.496 --> 21:41.254
I didn't do that.

21:41.985 --> 21:43.759
And I blew it.

21:46.422 --> 21:48.530
Now...

21:50.529 --> 21:52.863
I'm never gonna be able to get that back.

21:56.874 --> 21:58.403
Incoming!

21:58.891 --> 22:00.400
- Is this the one?
- Yep, yep, yep, yep.

22:00.424 --> 22:00.940
What happened?

22:00.964 --> 22:03.401
- Don't even try and guess 'cause you never will.
- It's all yours, Michael.

22:03.425 --> 22:04.986
Why don't you go ahead and take a look?

22:05.923 --> 22:06.905
Whoa.

22:06.929 --> 22:08.912
Yeah. Male and female, both 30s.

22:08.936 --> 22:09.984
She just got cosmetic braces

22:10.008 --> 22:11.766
and wanted to try them
out on her boyfriend,

22:11.790 --> 22:13.243
as it were, and let's just say something

22:13.267 --> 22:14.833
got caught between the tracks.

22:14.857 --> 22:17.514
- [Woman mutters]
- Ouch! Stop talking!

22:17.538 --> 22:19.868
[Moans] It hurts like crazy
when she tries to talk.

22:19.892 --> 22:22.617
Look... just help me,
please. I'm begging you.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.119
- And... and... and... and this would put me in the lead?
- This definitely puts you in the lead.

22:25.143 --> 22:26.197
Mollie!

22:26.221 --> 22:27.324
Get me a needle, please.

22:34.848 --> 22:36.160
Did you ju...

22:36.184 --> 22:37.831
are you kidding me? You gave that to him?

22:37.855 --> 22:39.472
Sorry, man. You were not around.

22:39.496 --> 22:41.690
Ohh! Looks like you're in last place.

22:41.714 --> 22:43.505
Not looking good for the home team.

22:43.734 --> 22:45.172
Hey, you give me the next crazy patient,

22:45.196 --> 22:46.485
and I'll give you 20 bucks of my winnings.

22:46.509 --> 22:47.915
Why are you whispering?

22:48.065 --> 22:51.190
Because I just offered you
30 bucks to throw me a solid.

22:51.214 --> 22:51.910
Yeah, you're right.

22:51.934 --> 22:53.922
$50 is a lot of money to
be advertising to everyone.

22:53.946 --> 22:54.622
What?!

22:54.646 --> 22:56.858
Dude, that's cash money up front.

23:01.202 --> 23:03.352
- [Grunts]
- Have you no morals?

23:05.009 --> 23:07.344
You better be taking me out with
all that cash you're earning.

23:07.368 --> 23:08.528
Why do you think I'm doing it?

23:08.552 --> 23:09.674

Oh, yeah, that's gotten complicated.

about? Who are you? What?!

up so I didn't hit the floor.

I-I had to grab her, too.

into a combat zone.

32:00.407 --> 32:02.837
- There are no guarantees here.
- I understand.

32:03.391 --> 32:05.207
Do you hear that?

32:05.231 --> 32:06.638
Now, think about Janet and the kids.

32:06.661 --> 32:08.055
You... you think you think

32:08.079 --> 32:10.093
I haven't thought about
my wife and my kids?

32:10.579 --> 32:12.177
I can go.

32:12.201 --> 32:13.447
- No. No. No way.
- I-I can.

32:13.471 --> 32:14.355
No. There's no way.

32:14.379 --> 32:15.689
You... you just got back,

32:15.713 --> 32:17.142
so you're not going anywhere.

32:17.166 --> 32:18.924
Right, Smalls? There's there's no room.

32:18.974 --> 32:21.106
Yeah, he got the last seat on the flight.

32:21.130 --> 32:23.743
But listen. There's one
thing I need you to do for me.

32:23.767 --> 32:24.799
Check your e-mail.

32:24.823 --> 32:26.792
I'm gonna send you my will
and my life-insurance policy.

32:26.816 --> 32:28.588
- Tophe...
- Okay, just in case.

32:28.849 --> 32:31.695
Thank you all for your
concern. I appreciate it.

32:31.719 --> 32:34.662
But I've made up my mind.
I'm going. Thank you.

32:37.069 --> 32:38.475
[Sighs]

32:38.499 --> 32:40.825
We should be able to get
the I.V. out of his arm soon.

32:40.849 --> 32:42.863
The meds have kicked in, and
he'll be better than ever.

32:42.887 --> 32:45.797
Thank you. Thank you.

32:45.993 --> 32:47.399
Hey, David.

32:47.423 --> 32:48.753
What the hell is <i> she</i> doing here?

32:48.777 --> 32:50.469
My lawyers are gonna tear you apart.

32:50.492 --> 32:51.898
You're going to jail.

32:51.922 --> 32:53.153
What are you doing, baby?

32:53.435 --> 32:55.361
- Don't make this mistake, okay?
- I...

32:55.385 --> 32:56.663
We should talk outside.

32:56.687 --> 32:59.021
Yes, we should. [Sighs]

33:01.951 --> 33:03.654
I don't know what you
think you're pulling here,

33:03.678 --> 33:05.002
but you're not helping, okay?

33:05.026 --> 33:07.323
Lisa, do not listen to her.
You don't want to do this.

33:07.347 --> 33:08.141
Or what?

33:08.165 --> 33:09.250
Yeah, or what?

33:09.694 --> 33:11.857
Who the hell are you? What is this?

33:11.881 --> 33:13.168
They help protect women and children

33:13.192 --> 33:14.697
who need to testify
against a-holes like you.

33:14.721 --> 33:16.102
[Chuckles] I used the Baltimore chapter.

33:16.126 --> 33:17.606
I'm sure the San Antonio
one is pretty good, too.

33:17.630 --> 33:20.196
Great. Okay, so, what are you gonna do?

33:20.220 --> 33:22.202
So, if anything happens to Lisa or Ethan,

33:22.226 --> 33:23.672
even if you're not at fault,

33:23.696 --> 33:25.374
even if he just falls off his bike,

33:25.398 --> 33:27.174
they're coming after you.

33:27.198 --> 33:29.500
I am... I am calling my lawyer.

33:29.534 --> 33:31.644
Yeah, you do that 'cause
you're gonna need him.

33:31.678 --> 33:33.598
Officer, you have the complaint.

33:33.622 --> 33:35.350
Sir, if you would come with us.

33:35.374 --> 33:37.100
We need to ask you some questions.

33:38.646 --> 33:41.588
[Sighs, chuckles]

33:41.612 --> 33:43.986
This is <i> unbelievable</i>... unbelievable.

33:44.708 --> 33:47.374
Hey, Ethan, I want you to meet the guys.

33:47.398 --> 33:51.402
Hey, buddy. You are so brave.

33:51.426 --> 33:55.200
Thank you so much. [Chuckles]

33:56.016 --> 33:58.350
Can I ask you... how long did it take

33:58.374 --> 34:00.321
before you weren't afraid anymore?

34:00.540 --> 34:02.139
I'm still working on it.

34:02.163 --> 34:04.349
Yeah. [Sniffles]

34:07.977 --> 34:10.679
[Voice breaking] I'm still working on it.

34:12.501 --> 34:14.963
Hey.

34:14.987 --> 34:18.158
I'm so proud of you.

34:22.741 --> 34:24.782
T.C.: How did the call go with your ex?

34:24.804 --> 34:25.780
It was great.

34:25.804 --> 34:28.426
Turns out that he was
curious about seeing his pops,

34:28.449 --> 34:30.428
and my ex has all the forgiveness

34:30.452 --> 34:31.870
of a good Christian woman.

34:31.893 --> 34:33.812
They want me to come to his graduation.

34:33.835 --> 34:35.099
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

34:35.123 --> 34:36.726
That's great, Walt. You
can get some closure.

34:36.751 --> 34:37.751
Yeah.

34:37.821 --> 34:39.331
I just wish I had a gift

34:39.356 --> 34:41.850
to give my son to tell
him how much I love him.

34:41.873 --> 34:44.284
Well... Mollie? Here's your gift.

34:44.308 --> 34:45.938
Got some crutches.

34:45.962 --> 34:47.379
- Crutches?
- Yeah.

34:47.402 --> 34:49.297
It's for your dislocated ankle.

34:49.770 --> 34:52.750
That's your official diagnosis.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.551
I'm not following.

34:54.574 --> 34:56.710
Look, if I were you,

34:56.734 --> 34:58.427
I'd take the cash in this envelope.

34:58.451 --> 35:00.018
I'd buy a life-insurance policy

35:00.062 --> 35:01.884
with your son as the main beneficiary.

35:01.917 --> 35:03.238
Pay for the first two years up front.

35:03.262 --> 35:05.062
There's enough in that
envelope to buy a policy

35:05.086 --> 35:06.950
that will help your
son get through college.

35:09.374 --> 35:11.515
What about the A.L.S. records here?

35:11.550 --> 35:14.719
Hey, records get lost all the time.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.505
But I'd buy the policy as soon as possible.

35:19.292 --> 35:20.570
Thank you.

35:20.594 --> 35:22.776
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Um,

35:22.799 --> 35:25.004
you think it would be all
right if I made Carlos' wife

35:25.028 --> 35:26.647
and their boy beneficiaries, too?

35:26.671 --> 35:29.229
Yeah, I think they'd appreciate that.

35:29.512 --> 35:32.742
Thanks again. But why are you doing this?

35:33.447 --> 35:34.757
[Sighs]

35:34.781 --> 35:38.075
Maybe someday somebody will
do the same thing for my kid.

35:38.109 --> 35:40.059
Take care, Walt.

35:40.093 --> 35:41.915
Okay?

35:44.792 --> 35:47.895
***

35:55.698 --> 35:58.624
[Elevator bell dings]

35:58.943 --> 36:00.989
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:05.786 --> 36:06.904
[Sighs]

36:06.928 --> 36:08.846
I know you're going with Topher.

36:10.603 --> 36:12.873
And I know you've
already made up your mind.

36:12.897 --> 36:15.071
[Sighs]

36:15.335 --> 36:16.453
I'm sorry.

36:16.477 --> 36:20.572
I... I just feel like I
don't have a choice, okay?

36:20.596 --> 36:24.033
You... you have a choice, okay?

36:24.057 --> 36:25.723
- We all have choices.
- [Sighs]

36:26.380 --> 36:29.137
And mine...

36:29.161 --> 36:32.263
Is to try and not stop you.

36:32.978 --> 36:34.741
You're letting me go?

36:34.765 --> 36:37.146
Honey, if something happened
to Topher over there,

36:37.170 --> 36:39.603
you would blame me for
stopping you, all right?

36:39.627 --> 36:41.341
You would think that you could
have done something to save him,

36:41.365 --> 36:42.835
- and I...
- No, no, no, no.

36:42.859 --> 36:44.042
I would never blame you.

36:44.066 --> 36:45.344
- Yes, you would.
- No.

36:45.368 --> 36:47.427
Yes. You would.

36:48.633 --> 36:50.342
Okay? Maybe not consciously

36:50.356 --> 36:52.244
or you'd try to pretend
that things were okay,

36:52.268 --> 36:54.411
but we would never survive that.

36:54.435 --> 36:55.249
No, Jordan...

36:55.273 --> 36:57.462
And we would <i> never</i>
recover from that.

36:57.501 --> 36:58.501
[Sighs]

36:59.047 --> 37:01.194
[Chuckles]

37:01.672 --> 37:04.485
It's okay, you know?

37:04.806 --> 37:07.652
It's a security detail in Afghanistan.

37:07.676 --> 37:09.382
You're gonna go over there.

37:09.406 --> 37:10.892
- You're gonna do an LVAD or...
- Yeah.

37:10.916 --> 37:12.450
- Some procedure like that.
- Right.

37:12.474 --> 37:14.020
And then you are gonna
come home... right?

37:14.044 --> 37:15.205
To your woman...

37:15.229 --> 37:16.283
- Yeah.
- And your baby.

37:16.316 --> 37:17.460
- Yeah.
- Yes.

37:17.484 --> 37:19.659
Yes, okay?

37:19.683 --> 37:21.690
Just a couple of days.

37:22.993 --> 37:25.295
Simple.

37:25.319 --> 37:26.757
I love you.

37:26.781 --> 37:28.595
I love you, too.

37:28.619 --> 37:30.505
I love you, too.

37:30.720 --> 37:33.502
I'll be back before you know it.

37:33.526 --> 37:36.404
[Chuckles] Okay.

37:36.428 --> 37:37.482
[Elevator bell dings]

37:37.506 --> 37:39.092
[Big Little Lions' "Fire me up" plays]

37:39.116 --> 37:41.865
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

37:42.013 --> 37:44.602
* You draw me in *

37:44.637 --> 37:46.395
* I've no control *

37:46.428 --> 37:48.379
* Under my skin *

37:48.413 --> 37:51.707
* Under the best part of my soul *

37:51.740 --> 37:54.810
* Oh, you fire me up *

37:54.845 --> 37:56.699
- * Oh oh *
- Wow.

37:56.732 --> 37:58.436
- * Oh oh *
- Yeah. I told you I had a story.

37:58.460 --> 38:01.274
[Chuckles]

38:01.319 --> 38:02.917
If I ever saw that guy...

38:02.941 --> 38:04.794
I know you would have.

38:06.656 --> 38:07.845
Look at me last week pressing you

38:07.869 --> 38:08.965
about what kind of guys you like.

38:08.989 --> 38:10.212
Oh, come on. You couldn't have known.

38:10.236 --> 38:11.397
- I'm so sorry.
- You couldn't have known.

38:11.421 --> 38:13.195
Yeah, still, I...

38:13.219 --> 38:15.972
Kenny, you are a good man,

38:15.996 --> 38:18.299
one of the best I've
known in a long time...

38:18.333 --> 38:21.146
Maybe ever.

38:21.181 --> 38:22.977
Come on.

38:26.332 --> 38:27.386
[Laughs]

38:27.421 --> 38:28.826
Oh, man.

38:28.860 --> 38:29.691
[Chuckling] What?

38:29.715 --> 38:31.076
We're moving pretty fast, aren't we?

38:31.100 --> 38:33.719
Yeah.

38:33.926 --> 38:35.620
That scare you?

38:35.644 --> 38:37.371
No.

38:37.518 --> 38:38.957
Does it scare you?

38:38.981 --> 38:40.335
Yeah.

38:43.772 --> 38:48.826
* My every day revolves
around your sun *

38:48.860 --> 38:51.354
* You fire me up *

38:51.388 --> 38:56.954
* And everything is
more intense because *

38:56.989 --> 39:02.554
* You fire me up *

39:02.589 --> 39:07.195
* Slow down *

39:07.228 --> 39:10.917
* I need to breathe *

39:10.941 --> 39:13.285
* Slow down *

* I have to believe *

T.C.: Hey.

39:18.140 --> 39:20.410
You think they're gonna
show a movie on this flight?

39:20.434 --> 39:22.564
What are you doing here?
I told you not to come.

39:22.588 --> 39:23.433
Ah.

39:23.457 --> 39:25.358
You didn't think I was gonna
let you go alone, did you?

39:25.382 --> 39:27.232
Not really. It was getting close, though.

39:27.256 --> 39:30.011
Yeah. I had to work something
out with Smalls to get a seat.

39:30.184 --> 39:32.132
So, are you sure about this?

39:32.156 --> 39:34.116
- * My every day revolves around your sun * -
because if something... sometimes happens...

39:34.140 --> 39:37.338
I wouldn't be where I am
today without you, okay?

39:37.372 --> 39:38.820
- * You fire me up *
- I know. I know.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.250
Now we're even.

39:40.274 --> 39:43.089
- * And everything is more intense *
- Yes! Yes, we are!

39:43.113 --> 39:46.487
- * Because you fire me up *
- [Groans]

39:46.511 --> 39:48.210
Try to keep up with me.

- * My every day revolves around your sun *
- [Laughs] Just like that, huh?

39:50.368 --> 39:52.135
Just like that.
