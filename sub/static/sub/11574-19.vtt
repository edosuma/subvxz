WEBVTT

00:10.052 --> 00:12.304
Are you still here?

00:12.388 --> 00:15.346
'Cause if you're not, it is so
not funny and I'll be uber-pissed.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.389
And it's just not--

00:21.939 --> 00:23.315
Okay, that was nice.

00:23.399 --> 00:27.017
But you don't have to blindfold
me to get a little sugar.

00:30.156 --> 00:32.363
You got me a necklace.

00:36.078 --> 00:39.662
With the key to your heart?

00:39.749 --> 00:42.161
You've already got that.

00:42.251 --> 00:45.414
That is a key to my apartment.

00:45.504 --> 00:49.167
A fashion accoutrement that is
both thoughtful and practical.

00:49.258 --> 00:50.964
What more could a girl want?

00:51.052 --> 00:55.091
Access to her boyfriend's
place any time, night or day.

00:55.181 --> 00:58.594
Okay, thanks.

01:00.144 --> 01:02.385
You're disappointed?

01:02.480 --> 01:05.938
Maybe just a little confused.

01:06.025 --> 01:07.686
I mean, when we go to your place,

01:07.777 --> 01:11.690
you're always there and you don't lock
your door half the time anyway, so--

01:11.781 --> 01:13.737
lt's symbolic.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.906
The past few months with
you have been so amazing

01:15.993 --> 01:18.985
and I thought that
it was time to kind of...

01:21.415 --> 01:24.407
...take it to the next level.

01:24.502 --> 01:29.041
The next level being a key swap.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.837
Exactly.

01:33.052 --> 01:34.713
| get it. | get it.

01:34.804 --> 01:37.637
It's just Bo's got a lot of
private stuff lying around

01:37.723 --> 01:39.839
and her sex life is
sort of unpredictable.

01:39.934 --> 01:43.017
I know, and I don't want
to walk in on that again.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.560
Yeah.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.855
Yeah, maybe this was a dumb idea.

01:48.943 --> 01:51.059
No.

01:51.153 --> 01:54.236
No. It was a very, very sweet idea.

01:59.078 --> 02:01.034
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.033
| see you've ramped up the security.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.910
Have there been any
new developments?

02:05.001 --> 02:07.333
I believe that one of the highest
ranking Light Fae officials

02:07.420 --> 02:09.456
may have been compromised.

02:09.547 --> 02:12.129
My friends here have been gathering
some information and told me

02:12.216 --> 02:15.549
that the Glaive is in the process of
forming an alliance with the Garuda.

02:15.636 --> 02:19.424
Using Peris as spies. Cute.

02:22.018 --> 02:25.135
Sorry. No offence. Wow.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.390
Look, I know that
the Glaive is important,

02:27.481 --> 02:29.312
but I've never known
exactly what she does.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.142
She writes the laws,
supervises them being enforced.

02:32.236 --> 02:35.228
Basically, she's responsible
for keeping the peace.

02:35.323 --> 02:38.611
Now, if, however, she brokers a deal
to align the Light with the Garuda,

02:38.701 --> 02:40.316
the Fae would once again be at war

02:40.411 --> 02:43.153
and the Garuda would have
a feast of hatred and rage.

02:43.247 --> 02:45.704
Which brings the conversation
back to why I'm here.

02:45.791 --> 02:49.830
I want you to neutralize the Glaive.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.876
"Neutralize"? You mean kill?

02:51.964 --> 02:56.253
Or kidnap. But termination
would be easier and a lot cleaner.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.255
You've got the wrong girl.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.882
I hope not, Bo.

02:59.972 --> 03:02.839
Because right now, we are at war
and this is only the beginning.

03:02.933 --> 03:03.843
In the coming weeks,

03:03.934 --> 03:06.846
your sense of what's right and wrong
is going to be severely tested.

03:06.937 --> 03:10.600
Now, can I count on you?

03:16.530 --> 03:19.442
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.445
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.448
My love carries a death sentence.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.621
l was lost for years,

03:27.708 --> 03:30.370
searching, while hiding,

03:30.461 --> 03:34.625
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:34.715 --> 03:39.584
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.222
Test solution ninety-three resulted in
a slight reduction of leukocytes,

03:53.317 --> 03:57.902
but failed to produce measurable
amounts of aberrant cell behaviour.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.570
Any luck?

04:03.661 --> 04:06.073
Nothing yet.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.905
Every test I run says the same thing.

04:08.999 --> 04:12.127
You're a hundred percent healthy.

04:12.211 --> 04:17.956
How is that possible? I still have a fever,
the blackouts are getting worse.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.756
| feel like I'm living in a nightmare.

04:19.844 --> 04:20.959
I can't explain it yet.

04:21.053 --> 04:26.173
I think it's a residual effect of
being on life support for five years.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.349
Sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.677
It's all right.

04:30.771 --> 04:36.391
Whatever this thing is,
we'll get through it, together.

04:36.485 --> 04:40.103
I'm still amazed at how you
stuck by me all that time.

04:41.824 --> 04:45.817
I would never abandon you.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.527
I don't know if I could have done it.

04:48.622 --> 04:52.865
Going five years without
holding someone close.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.372
Without that loving caress.

04:57.256 --> 04:59.212
You're amazing.

05:15.566 --> 05:16.646
--Hey.
--Hey.

05:16.734 --> 05:19.692
--Where have you been?
--Just walking.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.063
You want some coffee?

05:21.155 --> 05:22.645
Yeah.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.653
So?

05:27.745 --> 05:30.452
So...

05:30.539 --> 05:34.123
Nate wants to take our
relationship to the next level.

05:34.210 --> 05:36.542
And what level might that be?

05:36.629 --> 05:38.585
An open door policy.

05:38.672 --> 05:42.005
Oh, well, Nate is
welcome here any time.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.925
Oh, yeah? Even when a Brownie
is dusting our cobwebs,

05:45.012 --> 05:47.128
or a Morragh is trying
to drown you in the tub?

05:47.223 --> 05:49.134
Well, yeah, good point.

05:49.225 --> 05:51.432
Yeah.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.679
What did Lachlan want?

05:52.770 --> 05:56.979
Oh. Well, you remember
your old drinking pal, Tori?

05:57.066 --> 05:59.773
The high-maintenance,
low tolerance for alcohol,

05:59.860 --> 06:01.646
projectile-vomiting, telepath Tori?

06:01.737 --> 06:03.443
Yes, that's the one.

06:03.531 --> 06:07.069
Well, her mother, the Glaive, is a
big deal in the Light Fae hierarchy

06:07.159 --> 06:09.992
and Lachlan wants me to
bring her in dead or alive.

06:10.079 --> 06:12.035
Since when did you become
Dog the Bounty Hunter?

06:12.122 --> 06:14.704
Since Lachlan has no one
else that he can trust.

06:14.792 --> 06:18.660
Going after a high-ranking
Fae sounds insanely dangerous.

06:18.754 --> 06:20.085
Count me in.

06:20.172 --> 06:23.289
The Glaive is the guest
speaker at a function tonight.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.796
--Do you feel like crashing?
--Hell yes.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.263
The dynamic duo, back in action.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.678
Yeah.

06:29.765 --> 06:32.598
Bring it back, baby. What?

06:38.440 --> 06:41.273
I got the message you
wanted to see me.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.692
Thank you for coming.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.145
I need your help.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.525
I'm your man.

06:47.616 --> 06:50.153
I can feel the Garuda's
breath on my neck,

06:50.244 --> 06:52.200
but we're not ready to take him on yet.

06:52.288 --> 06:53.994
I can definitely help.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.948
Look, I've got a guy who can hook
us up with some heavy armament.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.454
I'm talking hand-held
anti-tank missiles.

06:59.545 --> 07:02.412
We don't need fire power,
we need intel.

07:02.506 --> 07:08.376
Specifically, I want to be up to
date on everything Lachlan knows.

07:08.470 --> 07:12.383
--You want me to spy on him?
--Essentially, yes.

07:17.313 --> 07:22.603
Test solution 112. Two parts sodium
chloride to three parts bromide.

07:26.405 --> 07:31.024
Test solution 112 generated no
measurable change in Nadia's blood.

07:35.372 --> 07:41.288
Test solution 113,
the Congolese virus antibody serum.

07:41.378 --> 07:45.587
The serum was developed to combat
a virulent Fae outbreak in Africa.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.539
It has no effect on human hemoglobin,

07:47.635 --> 07:50.468
but I must rule out all
potential contaminants.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.300
How is that possible?

08:06.612 --> 08:08.523
[THE GLAIVE] Unlike our
human counterparts,

08:08.614 --> 08:12.573
Fae women have held positions of
power and importance for centuries.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.244
From fierce warriors,
like the Celtic Faerie queens,

08:16.330 --> 08:18.571
to wise scholars like the Druids,

08:18.666 --> 08:22.204
we historically have
been treated as equals.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.706
In order to continue
that in today's world,

08:24.797 --> 08:30.508
we must always reach for greatness
and ascend to the highest pinnacles.

08:33.514 --> 08:40.886
Every moment, I want you to act
as if what you do makes a difference.

08:40.979 --> 08:44.312
It is critical that we take lessons
from Fae women before us

08:44.400 --> 08:49.269
and not compromise, because
we're all we've got, girls.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.694
Don't get to the end
of your life and realize

08:50.781 --> 08:52.737
that you've just lived the length of it.

08:52.825 --> 08:56.067
I want you to live the
breadth of it, as well.

08:56.161 --> 08:59.119
Wow! She is good.

09:01.709 --> 09:06.203
And remember as you go
forth today to never give up,

09:06.296 --> 09:09.880
because that could be
the time and place

09:09.967 --> 09:14.210
where the tides turn
and your fortunes change.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.386
Thank you.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.730
Whatcha' thinking, buttercup?

09:30.821 --> 09:33.779
I want to talk to her.
Form my own impression.

09:33.866 --> 09:35.857
You think the Ash-hole
might be playing you again?

09:35.951 --> 09:38.488
The thought is never far from my mind.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.285
You guys want to meet the mum?

09:40.372 --> 09:41.452
Yeah, that'd be great.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.828
I got to warn you,
she likes to hear herself talk.

09:49.506 --> 09:53.215
Let me know how it turns out.

09:53.302 --> 09:56.920
Mother. This is my friend, Kenzi.

09:57.014 --> 10:00.347
--A human. Tori, what did I tell--
--And her friend, Bo.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.181
Bo the succubus?

10:05.272 --> 10:06.773
Yes.

10:06.857 --> 10:10.850
It is a pleasure to finally meet you.
Your reputation precedes you.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.151
Which part of my reputation?

10:13.238 --> 10:15.615
Your bravery, your
countless acts of heroism.

10:15.699 --> 10:18.657
You're a tribute to Fae women and
should be held up as a role model

10:18.744 --> 10:20.405
to young Fae women everywhere.

10:20.496 --> 10:22.032
See what I mean?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.204
--Tota||y.
--|'m flattered.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.373
l, uh, I wish I knew you were here.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.872
I would have had you up on the stage
and introduced you to the crowd.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.669
Well, I think you did fine
up there all by yourself.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.839
Your speech was so inspiring.

10:33.926 --> 10:36.793
Well, I'm glad it resonated with you.

10:36.887 --> 10:41.597
I'm a firm believer not only in Fae women's
rights, but the individual obligation

10:41.683 --> 10:44.720
to make positive change each and
every day in the world around us.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.268
Amen.

10:52.236 --> 10:53.271
Wow.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.148
--Really?
--Yeah.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.949
Hey, babe, come here for a sec.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.572
Taking more blood?

11:02.663 --> 11:06.827
No. Today I'm making a
deposit instead of a withdrawal.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.407
What's in there?

11:08.502 --> 11:10.834
I finally had a positive test.

11:10.921 --> 11:15.039
Your blood reacted to the serum
I developed when we were in Africa.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.260
So, you think I caught that disease?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.505
Maybe a variant strain of it.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.963
I modified the serum so that it
would interact with your blood type.

11:23.058 --> 11:26.892
And I'm hoping that it
will kill off the virus.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.014
No.

11:28.105 --> 11:30.687
I thought you'd be happy about this.
Don't you want to feel better?

11:30.774 --> 11:32.935
No more needles.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.768
--Come on.
--I said no more needles!

11:43.120 --> 11:45.987
l was so blown away by the Glaive.

11:46.081 --> 11:49.073
I mean, she's like Oprah
without all the free cars.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.158
I've met her a few times over the years.

11:51.253 --> 11:54.245
She certainly knows how to turn
a phrase and control a room.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.454
I sense a but.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.916
But that doesn't mean her
intentions are necessarily honourable.

11:59.011 --> 12:01.548
Well, I'm no expert on politics,
but I find it hard to believe

12:01.638 --> 12:05.176
that the Glaive would--would sell
out the Fae to save her own ass.

12:05.267 --> 12:06.882
Maybe you just don't want to believe it.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.262
What does that mean?

12:08.353 --> 12:10.344
The Glaive's a very charismatic woman.

12:10.439 --> 12:15.308
Maybe you've placed her on a pedestal in
hopes that she's a beacon of goodness.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.814
I never realized you
were so cynical, Trick.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.942
Some people call it cynical,
others call it realistic.

12:21.033 --> 12:25.697
Okay. Okay. What is your
take on the Glaive?

12:25.787 --> 12:28.745
I'm guessing that she is forging
an alliance with the Garuda.

12:28.832 --> 12:29.867
Based on what?

12:29.958 --> 12:32.119
It's the smart move.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.542
The Garuda wants a war to break out.

12:34.630 --> 12:38.168
So, he makes an offer to
the Light and the Dark.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.625
"Join me and together,
we'll wipe out your enemy."

12:41.720 --> 12:43.051
So, he plays them off
against each other,

12:43.138 --> 12:46.096
offering them salvation
over annihilation.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.468
Exactly.

12:47.559 --> 12:51.848
When the real solution is for the Light
and the Dark to honour our treaty

12:51.939 --> 12:55.397
and to stand united against the Garuda.

12:55.484 --> 13:00.148
But it takes a very strong and
determined person to stay that course.

13:00.238 --> 13:05.232
So, the only question is what
kind of person is the Glaive?

13:37.484 --> 13:40.476
Hey, Bobo, what did
Trickster have to say?

13:40.570 --> 13:42.606
He agrees with Lachlan.

13:42.698 --> 13:45.781
Thinks the Glaive is making some
kind of deal with the Garuda.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.859
Hm. Well, I thought she looked hinky.

13:48.954 --> 13:52.321
Hm. She might be hinky.

13:52.416 --> 13:55.374
But how do I know she's
dangerous enough to neutralize?

13:55.460 --> 13:58.918
I've been thinking about it and I've
come up with a foolproof plan, okay?

13:59.006 --> 14:00.997
I'm going to do surveillance
on the Glaive for a few days.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.082
Check out her habits, her route to work.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.507
And then for a measly hundred bucks,

14:04.594 --> 14:06.175
my cousin Dima and his
capos are going to--

14:06.263 --> 14:08.504
Dima has capos?

14:08.598 --> 14:12.090
He believes Don Corleone
is his real father.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.643
He does know that Don Corleone
is a fictional character, right?

14:15.731 --> 14:17.722
I never had the heart to tell him.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.852
Anyway, I will give them
the deets and the cash

14:19.943 --> 14:22.650
and they'll have the Glaive scooped up
off the street and hogtied in the trunk

14:22.738 --> 14:24.399
before you can say cannoli.

14:24.489 --> 14:28.698
lnspired plan, Kenzi, but I think I'm
going to pass on Fredo and his boys

14:28.785 --> 14:31.447
and take a more direct approach.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.325
I like it. I'm going to go
lace up my butt-kicking boots.

14:34.416 --> 14:37.078
Thanks, but this is a solo mission.

14:37.169 --> 14:38.955
You're a buzzkill.

14:41.173 --> 14:43.414
You coming down with something?

14:43.508 --> 14:48.218
Uh uh. The Glaive is a telepath.

14:48.305 --> 14:52.719
Trick gave me this pill. It's some kind
of Fae beta blocker for brain waves.

14:52.809 --> 14:56.677
Like Magneto's helmet. That is so cool.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.428
Nadia! What are you doing?

15:32.516 --> 15:37.135
Stop it, please. Please. Please.

15:58.333 --> 16:01.666
l was very glad to get your call.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.744
Please have a seat.

16:03.839 --> 16:05.625
Thank you for making
the time to see me.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.923
Like I said last night, you're a
tribute to Fae women everywhere.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.093
What's on your mind?

16:15.183 --> 16:19.893
l... I've been unaligned my entire life.

16:19.980 --> 16:24.189
And after hearing you speak, I think
it's time that I committed to a side.

16:24.276 --> 16:25.857
Excellent idea.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.401
I love the fact that you're
taking charge of your life.

16:28.488 --> 16:34.905
But before I give myself over to one side,
I wanted to get your input.

16:36.746 --> 16:41.490
l'm flattered. Tell me about yourself.

16:41.585 --> 16:43.371
Don't hold anything back.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.998
I understand you've been spending
a lot of time with Trick lately.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.879
No more than usual.

16:51.970 --> 16:55.838
I drop in once in a while for a
drink and a little socializing.

16:55.932 --> 16:58.423
Just the two of you in his office.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.099
Is this going somewhere?

17:00.187 --> 17:02.428
You do realize that you have
a centuries-old obligation

17:02.522 --> 17:04.604
to serve the office of the Ash, correct?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.306
I am well aware.

17:08.945 --> 17:14.315
and now is not the time for secrets
or even worse, insubordination.

17:14.409 --> 17:15.910
I understand.

17:15.994 --> 17:21.205
Good. Now I'll tell you
where this is all going.

17:21.291 --> 17:25.034
I need you to give me any
information that will assist me

17:25.128 --> 17:27.619
in my campaign against the Garuda.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.079
Of course.

17:29.174 --> 17:32.211
That includes whatever you
learn from your friend, Trick.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.839
What makes you think Trick has
any information on the Garuda?

17:34.930 --> 17:39.924
He's a bartender. He hears everything.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.384
Don't underestimate me, Hale.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.686
We're actually on the
same side, you and |.

17:46.942 --> 17:51.106
And the next thing I know, I am
standing face to face with the Cherufe.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.403
Luckily, I was able to chill him out.

17:53.490 --> 17:56.277
For someone who's only been in the
Fae community for such a short time,

17:56.368 --> 17:58.359
you've certainly left your mark.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.910
Well, I guess I attract trouble.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.157
I think it's the exact opposite.

18:02.249 --> 18:05.958
You see a problem and you take it upon
yourself to do something about it.

18:06.044 --> 18:09.878
It's quite a selfless trait.

18:09.965 --> 18:13.378
Well, thank you.

18:13.468 --> 18:16.835
You... you mentioned
a barkeep named Trick.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.387
What's your relationship to him?

18:19.474 --> 18:21.965
Trick's a good friend.

18:22.060 --> 18:26.599
You might call him a mentor.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.181
How is it that a simple man
who runs a waystation

18:29.276 --> 18:32.609
could possibly mentor
someone such as yourself?

18:32.696 --> 18:35.028
He's very wise.

18:35.115 --> 18:39.074
He's been around for a
long time. He's seen a lot.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.078
I imagine he has.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.787
Please don't touch anything.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.665
I won't.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.667
Ooh, what's this?

18:53.758 --> 18:56.591
One of those things you don't touch.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.418
What does it do?

18:58.513 --> 19:01.971
Oh! Yikes.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.094
lndeed. It's called the Pixie Impaler.

19:04.185 --> 19:09.225
Huh. Okay, hands in pockets.

19:09.316 --> 19:12.228
So, Trickster...

19:12.319 --> 19:15.311
...this Garuda character,
it's coming our way, huh?

19:15.405 --> 19:18.397
Unfortunately true.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.231
What do you think my role in this whole

19:20.327 --> 19:22.739
end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it
scenario's going to be?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.239
What do you mean?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.572
Come on, Trick. You've got
eyes in the back of your head

19:26.666 --> 19:30.204
and who knows where else.
You know things.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.957
I can't predict the future.

19:33.048 --> 19:38.042
Okay, well, can you predict roughly
the next few months, weeks?

19:38.136 --> 19:42.175
Kenzi, you are the most
amazing human I've ever met.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.597
You always say the sweetest things.

19:44.684 --> 19:49.678
But this war that's coming,
it's not your fight.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.559
Maybe not technically.

19:51.649 --> 19:56.268
But it's your fight and it's Bo's fight
and that makes it my fight, too.

19:56.363 --> 20:00.402
I know you're dedicated to Bo,
but you have to live your own life.

20:00.492 --> 20:03.234
What about Nate?

20:03.328 --> 20:06.570
This isn't about Nate.

20:06.664 --> 20:12.000
It's not? I don't need eyes in the back of
my head to see how you feel about him.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.122
Come sit.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.671
You're right.

20:24.766 --> 20:29.931
l have seen the future of the Fae
and you're not a part of it.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.852
What do you mean "not a part of it"?

20:31.940 --> 20:35.728
The only way Bo can be the
champion she needs to be

20:35.819 --> 20:39.562
and lead the Fae to victory
is if she has no distractions.

20:39.656 --> 20:42.113
I'm a distraction?

20:42.200 --> 20:45.112
Bo's love for you is a distraction.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.194
She'd do anything to protect you.

20:47.288 --> 20:52.874
Which means in battle,
you're her weak spot, a liability.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.132
I've never thought about it that way.

20:58.216 --> 21:03.552
The best thing for you to do,
for Bo and for yourself,

21:03.638 --> 21:07.222
is to grab Nate and
move to somewhere safe.

21:07.308 --> 21:13.053
Lead your own lives away
from all this madness.

21:13.148 --> 21:16.686
I don't know what to say.

21:16.776 --> 21:20.360
Kenzi, I'd hate not having you around.

21:20.447 --> 21:26.659
But it's for the best, for you and for Bo.

21:26.744 --> 21:29.702
Things are about to get
very, very dangerous.

21:39.090 --> 21:43.629
Bo, it's Lauren. Will you please
call me as soon as you get this?

21:43.720 --> 21:45.836
It's about Nadia.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.972
I appreciate the gravity of the
decision you have to make,

21:53.062 --> 21:55.599
especially since the Fae are at
such a pivotal time in history.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.646
Which is?

21:57.734 --> 22:00.100
I think you know what
I'm talking about.

22:00.195 --> 22:01.401
The Garuda?

22:01.488 --> 22:03.729
Yes, the Garuda.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.359
Tell me what you know about it.

22:05.450 --> 22:08.066
Just whispers and rumours.

22:08.161 --> 22:11.198
l was hoping you could fill me in.

22:11.289 --> 22:14.372
The Garuda could very well
change the future as we know it.

22:14.459 --> 22:16.450
You mean destroy
everything as we know it.

22:16.544 --> 22:18.330
Not necessarily.

22:18.421 --> 22:22.790
The Garuda's an extremely
powerful force. Now just imagine

22:22.884 --> 22:28.095
the good you could accomplish if you
used that force to shape the future.

22:28.181 --> 22:32.094
I never really thought about it that way.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.392
This has been very enlightening.

22:41.486 --> 22:42.601
What is this?

22:42.695 --> 22:44.435
My father was a telepath.

22:44.531 --> 22:47.489
Not many people know that
my mother was a wood nymph.

22:47.575 --> 22:52.069
She had a strong symbiosis with nature,
which she passed along to me.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.779
You took a beta block
before you got here,

22:54.874 --> 23:00.369
which gave you away as someone
whose intentions are not pure.

23:00.463 --> 23:01.748
Who sent you?

23:01.839 --> 23:03.670
No one.

23:03.758 --> 23:07.125
Don't be so naive. What I can't
get from you telepathically,

23:07.220 --> 23:10.587
I can always get from you
with a little torture.

23:10.682 --> 23:12.263
Send her to the white room.

23:12.350 --> 23:13.465
The white room?

23:13.560 --> 23:14.970
Shiny white tiles.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.347
Easier to clean when things get messy.

23:24.153 --> 23:28.112
You might hurt me,
but you will not win this fight.

23:28.199 --> 23:31.032
Oh, I don't intend to hurt you,
I intend to kill you.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.998
Come on, give a sister a break.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.871
That's what I intend to do.

23:57.061 --> 23:59.677
Doesn't take a telepath to know
that you're not a murderer.

24:03.318 --> 24:06.105
You need to work on your
mind-reading skills.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.831
| see you found the place.

24:23.921 --> 24:26.412
Why did you call me here, Hale?

24:26.507 --> 24:28.293
I don't have time for games.

24:28.384 --> 24:29.965
None of us do.

24:31.846 --> 24:34.508
Hope you know what you're doing.

24:34.599 --> 24:36.055
So do |.

24:44.484 --> 24:45.940
Lachlan.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.069
To what do I owe this unexpected visit?

24:50.156 --> 24:51.566
Ask Hale.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.444
Okay, here's the deal.

24:53.534 --> 24:56.401
We all want the same thing,
to defeat the Garuda, right?

24:56.496 --> 24:57.201
Well, I don't know if that's--

24:57.246 --> 25:01.740
As heir to the Zamora clan, I am
invoking my right to call a parley.

25:01.834 --> 25:05.372
You're technically not the heir.
There's Val and your cousin Mitch and--

25:05.463 --> 25:08.500
Whatever. I can still call a parley.

25:08.591 --> 25:11.003
It's not every day that one of my
subordinates invokes a parley

25:11.094 --> 25:15.087
between myself and a
waystation keeper. No offence.

25:15.181 --> 25:18.264
None taken. I'm very proud to
be the keeper of a waystation--

25:18.351 --> 25:20.137
Gentlemen, please.

25:20.228 --> 25:23.095
The two of you need to be working
together to stop the Garuda.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.305
Now right now, the Ash
is making his plans.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.356
And the Blood King is--

25:29.195 --> 25:30.184
Sorry, Trick.

25:30.279 --> 25:33.646
It's all right, Hale, I long
suspected that Mr. MacCorieghan

25:33.741 --> 25:36.278
held a loftier place within the order.

25:41.457 --> 25:44.699
Services of the Ash
forever at your disposal.

25:44.794 --> 25:48.252
What about the services of the Naga?

25:48.339 --> 25:50.921
Naga?

25:51.008 --> 25:51.918
You know.

25:52.009 --> 25:55.593
It makes too much sense
for it not to be true.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.671
No one tells me anything.

25:57.765 --> 26:01.849
Well, since we've got the
introductions out of the way,

26:01.936 --> 26:03.972
let's take a look at your intel.

26:06.774 --> 26:08.981
They are so beautiful.

26:09.068 --> 26:13.152
Yeah, I figured they'd go with the decor.
Kind of derelicte moderne.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.275
Hey, just 'cause we
don't have solid walls

26:15.366 --> 26:17.322
don't mean we don't have style.

26:17.410 --> 26:20.447
You have more style than
anyone I have ever met.

26:22.123 --> 26:26.457
Well, maybe someday, you and I can
live in a place that's a little less...

26:26.544 --> 26:28.375
...drafty.

26:28.463 --> 26:31.330
Maybe. Someday.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.164
Then I'd get to know the real
Kenzi and figure out where you

26:33.259 --> 26:36.547
disappear to all the time and why you
have weapons lying around the house.

26:36.637 --> 26:40.300
Yeah, but then we'd lose all the
mystery in our relationship.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.809
I don't want mystery.

26:46.898 --> 26:53.144
| just want a normal, uncomplicated
relationship with the woman that I love.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.193
Too much to ask for?

26:56.908 --> 26:58.364
No.

27:00.995 --> 27:03.782
[cell phone ringing]

27:03.873 --> 27:05.864
Oh, damn. I'm going to
be late for my audition.

27:17.053 --> 27:19.840
Wow! That was some good-bye kiss.

27:27.647 --> 27:31.265
See ya. Break a leg.

27:31.359 --> 27:32.815
Yeah.

27:55.800 --> 28:00.089
Hey, Bo, where are you? You were
supposed to be home like an hour ago.

28:00.179 --> 28:03.091
There's just a lot of stuff I need
to talk to you about and--

28:03.182 --> 28:05.764
[knocking]

28:05.852 --> 28:07.433
Nate?

28:11.941 --> 28:14.307
--Hey.
--Where's Bo?

28:14.402 --> 28:17.018
She's not here.

28:17.113 --> 28:18.899
I said she's not here!

28:18.990 --> 28:20.571
Where's Bo?

28:31.168 --> 28:34.160
What have we got here?

28:34.255 --> 28:37.463
One double-dealing Glaive,
per your request.

28:37.550 --> 28:40.007
I'm impressed and, frankly, surprised.

28:40.094 --> 28:41.174
You doubted I could pull it off?

28:41.262 --> 28:45.130
No, I doubted that
you'd actually kill her.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.723
I am not an executioner.

28:51.814 --> 28:55.682
A second heart.
Like mother, like daughter.

28:55.776 --> 29:00.486
Your tides have turned, and your
fortunes have definitely changed.

29:10.124 --> 29:11.705
Kenzi!

29:14.587 --> 29:17.169
Oh my god. Are you okay?

29:17.256 --> 29:19.918
Yeah. A bump on the head.
I've had worse.

29:20.009 --> 29:22.876
It's nothing compared to the beating
I'm going to lay on Nadia's ass.

29:22.970 --> 29:25.427
Nadia? What... What was she doing here?

29:25.514 --> 29:26.503
Looking for you.

29:26.599 --> 29:29.591
She stormed in all Linda Blair and
started tossing things around,

29:29.685 --> 29:31.061
beginning with me.

29:31.145 --> 29:32.305
What the hell's wrong with her?

29:32.396 --> 29:33.932
I don't know.

29:34.023 --> 29:36.890
You know, the worst part is
Nate was here just before she came.

29:36.984 --> 29:38.394
She could have hurt him.

29:38.486 --> 29:39.976
Maybe even killed him.

29:40.071 --> 29:42.938
I'm sorry, Kenzi. I'm so sorry
you got caught up in all of this.

29:43.032 --> 29:45.739
Me being in danger is one thing.
Okay, I know what's out there

29:45.826 --> 29:47.782
and it's my decision to stay.

29:47.870 --> 29:50.282
But I cannot have Nate on the firing line.

29:50.373 --> 29:53.365
I know. I'm going to
track Nadia down and--

29:53.459 --> 30:01.047
Bo! It's not just Nadia or the Garuda or
some demon from the fifth level of hell.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.044
It's your world.

30:05.513 --> 30:09.677
I'm wondering if I belong in it or not.

30:09.767 --> 30:11.598
Oh.

30:11.686 --> 30:14.803
Nate wants a deeper
commitment from me.

30:14.897 --> 30:18.014
But how can I be in a relationship with
someone, with someone that I love,

30:18.109 --> 30:21.317
when I can't even tell him
the truth? lt's killing me.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.529
Oh, god.

30:28.536 --> 30:33.906
Things are heating up, Kenzi.
And it's only going to get crazier.

30:37.044 --> 30:41.504
The Garuda is on the move and I'm
pretty sure that I'm directly in his path.

30:41.590 --> 30:45.424
What can I do to help?

30:45.511 --> 30:49.845
Not be standing next to
me when he comes.

30:49.932 --> 30:51.638
What do you mean?

30:53.602 --> 30:59.723
You have become a huge part of my life.

30:59.817 --> 31:04.902
You're the sister that I never had
and I never want to lose.

31:04.989 --> 31:10.484
But you have to take Nate and you have
to go someplace far away from here.

31:10.578 --> 31:14.742
Someplace where you can look him
in the eye and tell him the truth.

31:14.832 --> 31:18.666
Bo, I am not leaving you here
to deal with all this by yourself.

31:18.753 --> 31:24.498
And I am not standing in the way
of your happiness or your safety.

31:24.592 --> 31:28.676
Kenzi, I love you.

31:30.890 --> 31:33.506
But you have to go away from here.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.348
Away from me.

31:44.361 --> 31:47.023
Come Oh, come Oh, come Oh, come Oh.

31:47.114 --> 31:49.605
Bo, it's Lauren again.
I've left you two messages--

31:51.368 --> 31:56.829
Nadia... where have you been?

31:56.916 --> 31:58.656
I don't remember.

32:03.589 --> 32:07.127
My brain feels like it's on fire.

32:07.218 --> 32:10.676
You're burning up. Come and sit down.

32:10.763 --> 32:13.254
Okay.

32:13.349 --> 32:14.464
What's happening to me?

32:14.558 --> 32:17.049
Just tell me the last thing
that you remember.

32:17.144 --> 32:22.104
I don't know what's real
and what's a dream.

32:22.191 --> 32:26.651
I remember attacking you
in the shower.

32:26.737 --> 32:30.480
It didn't really happen, did it?

32:30.574 --> 32:33.782
Yeah, it did.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.905
I didn't mean--

32:35.996 --> 32:38.703
It's okay. I know that you're
not yourself right now.

32:38.791 --> 32:43.251
Then who am |? What am |?

32:43.337 --> 32:45.794
You have to tell me the truth.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.621
Nadia, there are things that l--

32:47.716 --> 32:51.959
Lauren, do you love me?

32:52.054 --> 32:53.760
Of course I love you.

32:53.848 --> 32:59.559
Then stop trying to protect me
and tell me everything.

33:04.859 --> 33:06.440
Kenz?

33:06.527 --> 33:07.937
Hey.

33:08.028 --> 33:11.191
I brought donuts. Chocolate sprinkles.

33:11.282 --> 33:12.943
Of course you did.

33:14.577 --> 33:19.162
And that's when I brought you to
the Ash's compound for treatment.

33:19.248 --> 33:21.830
This is incredible.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.829
I never would have dreamed that there
would be a whole other world of

33:24.920 --> 33:29.960
people and creatures right
here walking among us.

33:30.050 --> 33:33.713
I'm so glad you're finally
confiding in me.

33:33.804 --> 33:36.591
So am |.

33:36.682 --> 33:39.264
Tell me more about Bo.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.808
| get the feeling she's special.

33:43.981 --> 33:47.189
She is special to me.

33:47.276 --> 33:48.686
She's become a very good friend.

33:48.777 --> 33:51.940
No, I mean special in the Fae world.

33:52.031 --> 33:53.191
[cell phone ringing]

33:53.282 --> 33:54.988
Don't answer that.

33:55.075 --> 33:57.817
lt's Bo, | just have to--

33:57.912 --> 34:01.370
Just forget about Bo.

34:01.457 --> 34:03.573
It's just you and me right now.

34:07.296 --> 34:09.912
I thought these donuts
were your favourites.

34:10.007 --> 34:11.588
They are.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.716
What's wrong?

34:17.556 --> 34:21.469
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.551
About what?

34:23.646 --> 34:25.352
About everything.

34:27.733 --> 34:31.146
Well, now's a good time for the truth.

34:31.237 --> 34:34.729
Wish it was that easy.

34:34.823 --> 34:36.609
Kenzi...

34:39.703 --> 34:40.909
You trust me?

34:40.996 --> 34:44.238
Of course.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.449
And do you love me?

34:50.172 --> 34:52.914
That's not a trick question.

34:53.008 --> 34:55.090
Do you love me?

34:55.177 --> 34:57.463
It's just not as simple as that.

34:57.554 --> 35:01.638
Yes, it is.

35:01.725 --> 35:05.513
Nate, we can't be together anymore.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.346
What?

35:08.440 --> 35:09.850
Whoa. Wait. Wait, wait, w--
Okay, hold on.

35:09.942 --> 35:12.354
Look, if I'm putting too much
pressure on you, I can back off.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.059
We can leave everything the way it is.

35:14.154 --> 35:15.985
No, we can't.

35:18.659 --> 35:21.150
Why? What's changed?

35:23.914 --> 35:24.903
Is there someone else?

35:24.999 --> 35:28.457
No, of course not.

35:28.544 --> 35:30.535
What are you so afraid of?

35:30.629 --> 35:34.622
Because whatever it is, I'm here
for you, okay, I can help you.

35:34.717 --> 35:36.753
I can protect you.

35:39.430 --> 35:45.096
You are the best thing that
has ever happened to me, Kenzi.

35:45.185 --> 35:47.096
I love you.

35:50.816 --> 35:55.810
This thing we have, it's not real.

35:55.904 --> 35:56.893
It's real for me.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.947
Well, I thought it was real for me, too.

36:00.034 --> 36:02.446
But it was just a six-year-old's
fantasy come to life.

36:02.536 --> 36:05.027
I kept hoping that it would work.

36:05.122 --> 36:12.369
That I would feel for you
what you feel for me, but I don't.

36:12.463 --> 36:14.419
Okay.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.883
Okay, you know, you just...

36:19.595 --> 36:22.712
--You tell me what I can do.
--There's nothing you can do.

36:25.059 --> 36:27.721
ljust...

36:27.811 --> 36:30.302
| just don't love you.

36:37.571 --> 36:40.358
So, when you told
me that you loved me...

36:43.619 --> 36:45.359
...it was all a lie?

36:45.454 --> 36:46.910
No.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.373
--I thought I did--
--Know what, you can keep that key

36:51.460 --> 36:54.543
--'cause I'm leaving town.
--Nate, don't leave like this, please.

36:54.630 --> 36:56.461
So, how am I supposed to leave?

36:56.548 --> 37:00.757
Happy that the only girl that
I ever loved just dumped my ass?

37:05.808 --> 37:08.015
I'm so sorry.

37:20.531 --> 37:23.739
I want to know more about
the Ash and his compound.

37:23.826 --> 37:26.317
Nadia!

37:26.412 --> 37:27.401
What are you doing here?

37:27.496 --> 37:29.361
What were you doing at my place?

37:29.456 --> 37:31.833
Why did you attack Kenzi?

37:31.917 --> 37:35.409
What? What did you do?

37:35.504 --> 37:37.119
I don't remember.

37:37.214 --> 37:40.923
Baby, please, tell Bo to
leave so we can talk.

37:41.009 --> 37:44.627
I'm not going anywhere until
I find out what the hell is going on.

37:50.102 --> 37:52.639
You want to pick on
someone your own size, huh?

37:52.729 --> 37:54.435
Bo, no, no, what are you doing?

37:54.523 --> 37:55.729
I am getting answers!

37:55.816 --> 37:58.808
Lauren, please, tell Bo to put
the knife down and we can all talk.

37:58.902 --> 38:00.517
Don't listen to her, Lauren. It is a trick.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.477
No, no, Bo. Bo, she's sick.

38:02.573 --> 38:04.859
You're scaring her.
Please put the knife down.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.986
Bo, please!

38:08.370 --> 38:09.826
Please.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.585
You stay out of this.

38:22.676 --> 38:27.295
Nadia, it's me, Lauren.
Fight it, sweetie, fight it.

38:27.389 --> 38:32.053
Oh, Lauren. Lauren, please help me.

38:32.144 --> 38:35.807
There's something inside of me.
I can feel its hatred.

38:35.898 --> 38:38.264
It wants to kill.

38:39.693 --> 38:40.853
The Garuda.

38:40.944 --> 38:43.731
The pain is too much.

38:45.824 --> 38:49.282
You got to stop it while
you still can. Please.

38:49.369 --> 38:53.612
No, I can't. I don't know what to do.

38:53.707 --> 38:56.039
Kill me now.

38:56.126 --> 38:59.414
No. No, baby, I can't do that.
I can't do that.

38:59.505 --> 39:07.503
Bo, please, just please do it.
Make it go away.

39:07.596 --> 39:11.589
Bo, do it. Do it for her. Do it for me.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.139
I can't! I can't!

39:13.227 --> 39:16.219
--Bo, just do it.
--It wants me to kill!

39:16.313 --> 39:18.099
[LAUREN] Bo! Bo!

39:31.703 --> 39:33.989
Thank you.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.547
I'm sorry.

39:42.631 --> 39:49.002
No. Don't say you're sorry.
This is my fault.

39:49.096 --> 39:54.841
It's all my fault. You stay with me.

39:54.935 --> 39:57.472
Please stay with me.

40:35.559 --> 40:37.015
Kenzi?

40:53.160 --> 40:55.116
Hey, Kenz.

40:58.665 --> 41:00.656
You okay?

41:05.631 --> 41:07.792
Hey.

41:07.883 --> 41:10.374
What's wrong? What happened?

41:16.558 --> 41:21.552
Nate... we broke up.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.854
Oh, Kenz. I thought--

41:23.940 --> 41:26.773
It was never going to work.

41:26.860 --> 41:29.272
What do you mean?

41:29.363 --> 41:33.276
I couldn't have him in my life
and protect him at the same time.

41:33.367 --> 41:36.109
Kenzi, I told you--

41:36.203 --> 41:39.912
I know what you told me.

41:39.998 --> 41:42.990
And what Trick told me
and what Nate told me, but

41:43.085 --> 41:46.248
what about what my heart told me?

41:46.338 --> 41:52.129
lt told me that this is where
I belong right now, by your side.

41:54.554 --> 41:57.967
I want you to be happy.

41:58.058 --> 42:01.892
And I know that Nate makes you happy.

42:04.106 --> 42:06.222
Maybe someday,
things will be different.

42:06.316 --> 42:10.150
I'll be able to have a normal life.

42:10.237 --> 42:17.234
But right now, this is
the life that I choose.

42:17.327 --> 42:19.568
Are you sure?

42:28.630 --> 42:30.086
Good.

42:31.591 --> 42:36.711
Because I've never needed my
best friend more than I do right now.

42:43.729 --> 42:45.765
Did you find Nadia?

42:47.983 --> 42:49.439
Yeah.

42:49.526 --> 42:51.767
What happened?

42:55.490 --> 42:58.857
Maybe we should just
talk about it later, okay?

43:01.663 --> 43:05.326
Is it okay if I sleep here tonight?

43:05.417 --> 43:07.453
It's more than okay.
