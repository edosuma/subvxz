00:06.573 --> 00:08.941
Liv, it's Halloween week.

00:08.943 --> 00:10.009
Let's stay up all night

00:10.011 --> 00:12.177
and watch
"kill it so it dies 3."

00:14.547 --> 00:16.148
Are you asleep?

00:16.150 --> 00:19.785
( Screaming )

00:19.787 --> 00:21.754
Both: Gotcha!

00:23.256 --> 00:25.891
Boy, did you jump, Maddie.

00:25.893 --> 00:28.193
So sorry.
Didn't meant to
make you go...

00:28.195 --> 00:30.863
( Mimics screams, laughs )

00:30.865 --> 00:34.867
Ha ha, real mature.

00:34.869 --> 00:36.135
Aren't you guys a little old

00:36.137 --> 00:37.870
for Halloween pranks?

00:37.872 --> 00:39.004
Help me up.

00:39.006 --> 00:40.272
- Come on.
- ( Cracks )

00:40.274 --> 00:43.876
( Girls scream )

00:45.912 --> 00:48.814
Mm! Put that in
your pumpkin and carve it!

00:49.816 --> 00:52.718
<i>( Theme music plays )</i>

00:52.720 --> 00:54.086
<i>¶ Better in stereo</i>

00:54.088 --> 00:56.588
<i>¶ b... b... better in stereo</i>

00:56.590 --> 00:58.323
- <i>¶ I'm up with the sunshine</i>
<i>- ¶ Let's go</i>

00:58.325 --> 01:00.859
- <i>¶ I lace up my high tops</i>
<i>- ¶ Oh no</i>

01:00.861 --> 01:02.694
- <i>¶ slam dunk</i>
<i>- ¶ Ready or not</i>

01:02.696 --> 01:04.630
<i>¶ yeah, show me what you got ¶</i>

01:04.632 --> 01:07.132

- <i>¶ Holler</i>

01:07.134 --> 01:08.867
<i>¶ I dare you,</i>
<i>come on and follow ¶</i>

01:08.869 --> 01:11.770
<i>¶ you dance to your own beat ¶</i>

01:11.772 --> 01:13.238

01:13.240 --> 01:15.340
<i>¶ when you say yea-ah-ah</i>

01:15.342 --> 01:17.576

01:19.947 --> 01:22.314

01:34.261 --> 01:36.795
<i>¶ the half I'll always need</i>

01:36.797 --> 01:38.230
<i>¶ but we both know</i>

01:38.232 --> 01:40.599
<i>¶ we're better in stereo.</i>

01:47.273 --> 01:49.942
I keep seeing
all these signs
for scream fest.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.310
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that a contest?

01:51.312 --> 01:53.312
Because I do
the absolutely best

01:53.314 --> 01:54.746
horror movie scream.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.216
( Screams in horror )

01:58.384 --> 02:02.221
Yeah, it's...
It's not quite like that.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.257
They'll turn the whole place
into a haunted carnival.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.126
It's my favorite day
of the school year...

02:07.128 --> 02:09.695
Except all the days
I get to come here and learn.

02:09.697 --> 02:13.132
Ocean, don't repeat that.

02:13.134 --> 02:15.801
Other people don't get you
in the way that I barely do.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.669
Noted.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.304
So you only have
three days to get ready.

02:19.306 --> 02:23.075
Nope. I already know
exactly what I'm going to be.

02:23.077 --> 02:24.343
And I'm not telling anyone.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.879
Oh, you're not
gonna fool me, sista.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.113
I am good.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.281
You're talking to a girl
who once found

02:29.283 --> 02:31.383
a needle in a haystack.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.352
Literally.
It hurt.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.290
- What's up, Rooney?
- What's up, diggie?

02:38.292 --> 02:40.125
Got your costume ready
for scream fest?

02:40.127 --> 02:41.226
You know I do.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.694
I got this really cool
knight costume

02:42.696 --> 02:45.264
and it is going
to melt your face off.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.431
Sweet.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.066
Hey, I'll go as that too, then.

02:48.068 --> 02:50.135
Maybe we can win
the couples' costume contest.

02:50.137 --> 02:53.071
Yeah, okay.

02:53.073 --> 02:54.406
He said "couple."

02:54.408 --> 02:56.175
Couple!

02:56.177 --> 02:58.710
Do I want that?
Should I want that?

02:59.946 --> 03:02.214
Whatever.
( Snorts )

03:02.216 --> 03:04.316
I'm sure it's not a big deal.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.685
It's a big deal!

03:06.687 --> 03:09.354
And you know when
I say "couple,"

03:09.356 --> 03:12.090
I mean like for
the contest category, and...

03:12.092 --> 03:14.293
( Both awkwardly laugh )

03:14.295 --> 03:16.228
Well, you get it.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.430
What's not to get?

03:18.432 --> 03:19.965
Okay.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.036
I didn't get any of it.

03:24.038 --> 03:27.372
Oh, excuse me.
I'm new.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.107
Do you know where
the principal's office is?

03:29.109 --> 03:31.743
Yeah, it's just down the hall
and to the right.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.445
- I'm skyler.
- Maddie.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.780
Welcome to ridgewood.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.418
( Laughs )

03:39.420 --> 03:42.087
Who was that?

03:43.456 --> 03:45.490
That was skyler.
She's new.

03:45.492 --> 03:46.758
New?

03:46.760 --> 03:48.727
New as in she has
no idea who I am

03:48.729 --> 03:51.296
and doesn't know me
as the stink ninja?

03:53.366 --> 03:55.033
Yeah, you should
go talk to her.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.435
No can do.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.337
When I talk to girls,
I tend to...

03:58.339 --> 03:59.905
how should I say this?

03:59.907 --> 04:02.507
Fail.

04:02.509 --> 04:05.244
Joey, I'm sure
it's not that bad.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.045
- Mm...
- Here.

04:08.314 --> 04:09.281
Talk to her.

04:09.283 --> 04:12.985
Hey, girl.

04:12.987 --> 04:16.221
If you were a laser,
you'd be set on stunning.

04:18.891 --> 04:20.826
( Clicks tongue )

04:20.828 --> 04:22.995
Wow.

04:22.997 --> 04:24.296
You were not kidding.

04:24.298 --> 04:27.165
Yeah, but do not worry.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.434
I plan on blossoming
my sophomore year...

04:29.436 --> 04:31.503
Of college.

04:36.075 --> 04:39.845
- ( Evil laugh )
- ( Screams )

04:39.847 --> 04:41.313
Ha ha! Gotcha!

04:42.248 --> 04:44.850
Peppino the pumpkin clown
is back!

04:44.852 --> 04:48.120
I'm just an innocent
Halloween pumpkin...

04:48.122 --> 04:49.288
Then pow!

04:50.290 --> 04:53.158
Bloody hatchet in your face.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.427
What is peppino
doing back here?

04:55.429 --> 04:56.928
We just found him.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.864
I still can't believe some jerk

04:58.866 --> 05:00.999
stole him off our porch
last year.

05:01.001 --> 05:04.136
There are disgusting,
degenerate lowlifes
out there, son.

05:05.171 --> 05:06.505
I stole peppino.

05:06.507 --> 05:09.041
I am the disgusting,
degenerate lowlife.

05:09.043 --> 05:11.843
I took Karen to a fair
for our first date.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.346
I won her peppino
at the ring toss.

05:14.348 --> 05:17.416
The lady was quite impressed.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.851
I hate it.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.253
Can you believe it?

05:21.255 --> 05:23.422
He was just sitting there
at the church swap meet.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.324
Apparently, whoever took him

05:25.326 --> 05:28.026
was riddled with guilt,
turned him him in.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.261
Hmm.

05:29.263 --> 05:30.595
Not a shred of guilt.

05:30.597 --> 05:32.497
I threw it in the dumpster
behind the church.

05:32.499 --> 05:36.101
I should have remembered
that father Gary's
a dumpster diver.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.541
- <i>( Door closes )</i>
<i>- You're going down, clown.</i>

05:47.113 --> 05:48.547
Joey needs help.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.415
You're just realizing this now?

05:50.417 --> 05:53.452
No, I mean help with girls.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.354
Ahem, I say again,

05:55.356 --> 05:57.422
you're just realizing this now?

05:57.424 --> 05:59.458
We have to teach him
how to talk to girls

05:59.460 --> 06:02.494
There's this new girl
that he really likes and...

06:02.496 --> 06:03.962
hold on.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.632
Scream fest is this weekend.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.434
Joey's not the kind
of project that you just

06:09.436 --> 06:12.304
put a new coat of paint on
and he's fixed.

06:12.306 --> 06:13.572
He's a tear down and rebuild.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.941
Okay, well,
I at least have to try.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.609
Okay, well...
( Chuckles )

06:17.611 --> 06:19.010
If you ask me,

06:19.012 --> 06:20.112
you really shouldn't
get involved

06:20.114 --> 06:21.380
in other family members'
love lives.

06:21.382 --> 06:24.316
Are you kidding?

06:24.318 --> 06:25.984
Liv, you do that all the time.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.552
Oh, I know.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.421
I said "you"
shouldn't get involved.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.493
All I know is that,
if we don't help him now,

06:34.495 --> 06:36.261
in 20 years
he's going to be living

06:36.263 --> 06:38.096
in one of our basements.

06:38.098 --> 06:41.032
Seriously, you're just
realizing all of this

06:41.034 --> 06:42.200
right now?

06:45.505 --> 06:47.372
Joey needed advice from a guy.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.408
And I could have asked dad,
but he's been out of the game

06:49.410 --> 06:52.344
for at least 60 years.

06:52.346 --> 06:55.080
Besides, I knew someone cuter.

06:58.317 --> 07:02.187
Wow, you're really good
at "tongue of the phantom."

07:02.189 --> 07:05.657
You know, playing video games

07:05.659 --> 07:08.460
actually requires
more skill than...

07:08.462 --> 07:10.429
Talking to girls.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.598
Diggie, if you came here
for me to teach you

07:13.600 --> 07:15.133
how to talk to girls,

07:15.135 --> 07:18.470
I think you're gonna
be disappointed.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.405
Uh, dude to bro,

07:20.407 --> 07:22.941
Maddie wants me to help you
with your chick chat.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.476
But it's not that hard.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.344
You just got to practice
your jump shot

07:26.346 --> 07:28.213
if you want to make it
in the big leagues, you know.

07:28.215 --> 07:32.250
Yeah, I don't really
do sports talk.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.455
If you could put that
in like a zombie-related

07:36.457 --> 07:38.356
or dragon-slaying
metaphor...

07:38.358 --> 07:41.460
I also speak checkers
if that is any easier.

07:43.362 --> 07:45.297
Okay.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.668
Zombies have
taken over the world.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.369
There are two humans
left on earth...

07:51.371 --> 07:53.438
you and a really cute
girl named skyler.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.407
The whole future of humanity

07:55.409 --> 07:57.409
depends on you
hitting it off with her.

07:57.411 --> 07:59.110
So what are you going to say?

07:59.112 --> 08:03.281
( Screams )
Oh! Eat skyler first!

08:08.221 --> 08:10.088
Okay, let's try
a different approach.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.325
Um, scream fest
is this weekend.

08:13.327 --> 08:16.294
What you need is
a great costume that's
a conversation starter.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.729
Okay, yeah, no.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.131
I was thinking
of going as stav,

08:20.133 --> 08:23.235
the android from my
self-published graphic novel

08:23.237 --> 08:26.238
"android in da house."

08:26.240 --> 08:27.372
Check it.

08:27.374 --> 08:31.476
( Mimics machine whirring )

08:31.478 --> 08:34.613
( Robotically )
Android in da house.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.458
Really cool knight outfit, Liv!

08:46.460 --> 08:48.393
Told you I'd figure out
your costume.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.494
Sorry, ocean.

08:49.496 --> 08:51.162
It's just me, Maddie.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.231
The quest continues.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.499
Happy scream fest.

08:58.337 --> 08:59.738
Both: What are you wearing!

09:01.674 --> 09:03.341
I'm a knight.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.809
We said we were
gonna be knights.

09:04.811 --> 09:09.548
Oh, I thought you meant
like the night.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.485
Are you kidding?

09:13.487 --> 09:14.352
We're never gonna
be able to enter

09:14.354 --> 09:15.654
the couples' contest now.

09:15.656 --> 09:20.125
No, sure we can.
We're a couple of knights.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.127
( Chuckles ) Yup.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.496
That is us...
a couple...

09:24.498 --> 09:26.197
- Of knights.
- Yeah.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.799
If there were one more of us,
we'd be a few,

09:27.801 --> 09:30.201
but there's not because
we're a couple of knights.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.073
( As Elvis ) Hey, little mama!

09:37.276 --> 09:41.346
You ready for
a hunka hunka burning Joey?

09:41.348 --> 09:44.082
Wow, you actually look
kind of cool.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.518
Thank you.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.286
Thank you very much.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.823
Joey: <i>Okay, there's skyler.</i>

09:51.825 --> 09:54.092
I'm going in.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.126
Ah, hold on.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.529
for the championship game,
okay?

09:57.531 --> 10:00.365
You need to just warm up
on some practice girls first.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.667
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, smart.

10:02.669 --> 10:04.302
Time for me to work my...

10:04.304 --> 10:06.471
Memphis magic.

10:07.707 --> 10:10.575
'Cause Elvis lived in Memphis.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.510
Come on people,
rock and roll existed

10:12.512 --> 10:14.546
before maroon 5.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.384
Sure hope this works.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.653
Yeah, me too.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.188
Otherwise this is going to be

10:23.190 --> 10:24.856
a very long night.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.891
Oh, and this time
I do mean <i>the </i> night.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.127
I know you get confused.

10:36.535 --> 10:37.669
Hey, little mummy.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.806
Are you from Tennessee?

10:41.808 --> 10:44.309
'Cause you're
the only ten I see.

10:54.453 --> 10:57.422
Wow, he literally struck out

10:57.424 --> 10:59.157
with an inanimate object.

11:08.467 --> 11:10.435
- ( Evil laugh )
- ( Screaming )

11:10.437 --> 11:11.870
( Laughs )

11:11.872 --> 11:13.905
I see you've met peppino.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.874
Sorry about the flaxseed bars,
everybody.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.442
Wife's idea.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.511
Happy Halloween, everybody.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.547
Happy Halloween!

11:22.549 --> 11:24.883
Never gets old, my friend.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.584
Never gets old.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.386
( Sirens wail )

11:28.388 --> 11:30.355
I got him!
I got him.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.290
I got him!
I got the thief!

11:34.727 --> 11:35.794
Dad?

11:36.929 --> 11:40.532
Parker, why am I in a net?

11:40.534 --> 11:43.501
I was worried someone might
try and steal peppino again

11:43.503 --> 11:47.672
so Joey helped me set up
this net and motion cameras.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.574
That's very impressive.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.276
But as I've said many times,

11:51.278 --> 11:53.912
don't set traps
without telling me.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.417
Are you a thirsty witch?

12:01.487 --> 12:04.289
Allow me, witch...

12:04.291 --> 12:05.557
Way did she go?

12:07.960 --> 12:10.695
There's no way
he's ready to talk to skyler.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.230
Yeah, you're right.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.073
I need to find him
a sure thing to practice on.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.935
( With aussie accent )
G'day, mate.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.971
to skewer my shrimp
for the Barbie?

12:19.973 --> 12:23.475
Not now, so hop along.

12:23.477 --> 12:24.676
Hop, hop, hop.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.780
Maddie, it's me.
Liv.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.949
Halloween surprisies.

12:32.551 --> 12:34.819
Liv, I had no idea
that was you.

12:34.821 --> 12:36.521
Crazy, right?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.356
Okay, but don't tell anyone
because ocean's looking for me.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.691
Wait a minute.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.826
If I didn't recognize you,
then neither will Joey.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.394
This is perfect.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.429
He's been striking out
all night

12:44.431 --> 12:45.563
and he really needs a win

12:45.565 --> 12:46.998
before he can go in
and talk to skyler.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.501
I need you to go flirt
with our brother.

12:51.570 --> 12:55.507
Well, I lived in Hollywood
for four years.

12:55.509 --> 12:56.808
This is by far

12:56.810 --> 12:59.477
the weirdest party
I have ever been to.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.845
Yeah, you're right.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.580
You probably couldn't handle

13:02.582 --> 13:04.415
an acting job this challenging.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.452
I know what you're doing
and I accept your challenge.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.854
Lights, camera, dingoes!

13:29.975 --> 13:31.676
G'day, mate.

13:31.678 --> 13:35.013
Got to respect a bloke who's
not afraid to dance solo...

13:35.015 --> 13:37.048
In the hallway...

13:37.050 --> 13:38.583
In a jumpsuit.

13:40.586 --> 13:43.855
I hope this
isn't kanga-rude,

13:43.857 --> 13:45.690
but I can't help wondering

13:45.692 --> 13:47.525
if trapped inside that kangaroo

13:47.527 --> 13:49.928
is a stone-cold fox.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.431
Trapped inside that kangaroo
is a girl

13:53.433 --> 13:55.767
who almost threw up
in her mouth.

13:55.769 --> 13:58.469
I'm Sandy the foreign
exchange student

13:58.471 --> 13:59.671
from Australia.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.006
Joey... dark, mysterious

14:02.008 --> 14:03.808
with just a touch of whimsy

14:03.810 --> 14:05.977
and not one cavity.

14:05.979 --> 14:09.848
Well, Joey,
you are quite the catch.

14:09.850 --> 14:14.552
No kangaroo has ever
said that to me before.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.455
I'm gonna leave this
conversation on a high note.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.525
( High-pitched vocalizing )

14:29.935 --> 14:31.569
They had upped their game.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.643
I was going to have to up mine.

14:40.846 --> 14:42.614
( Evil laugh )

14:46.552 --> 14:48.553
( Siren wails )

14:48.555 --> 14:50.521
( Evil laugh )

14:52.558 --> 14:53.658
( Laugh dies )

14:53.660 --> 14:57.562
Who's laughing now, clown?

14:57.564 --> 14:59.998
( Sinister laugh )

15:01.066 --> 15:03.902
Mad dog Rooney needs
a strike for the win.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.937
Can she do it?

15:07.573 --> 15:11.075
Oh, in your face, diggles.
Bam! What?!

15:12.177 --> 15:13.645
The only reason I lost

15:13.647 --> 15:16.047
was because I have
stars in my eyes.

15:17.516 --> 15:19.651
No, seriously,
this pointy one
almost took my eye out.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.153
( Snorts )

15:22.155 --> 15:23.488
This is fun.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.822
Yeah, we may not

15:24.824 --> 15:26.691
have won the couples'
costume contest,

15:26.693 --> 15:29.894
but we still make
a great couple.

15:29.896 --> 15:30.995
( Stammers )

15:30.997 --> 15:32.497
You know, by couple,

15:32.499 --> 15:34.599
you get I mean?

15:35.534 --> 15:36.868
I have no idea what he means,

15:36.870 --> 15:39.003
but I like that he's saying it.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.972
Are we a couple?
Are we not a couple?

15:40.974 --> 15:42.607
Give me a sign, woman!

15:44.610 --> 15:45.677
Oh, great news.

15:45.679 --> 15:48.713
I can talk to girls now.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.715
Awesome.
You talked to skyler?

15:50.717 --> 15:51.683
Nope!

15:51.685 --> 15:53.851
I figured, why am I

15:53.853 --> 15:55.153
chasing after skyler?

15:55.155 --> 15:56.955
I already talked
to a really cool girl.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.489
And I'm gonna ask her out.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.691
Wait, what girl?

15:59.693 --> 16:01.793
An Australian lady kangaroo

16:01.795 --> 16:03.628
foreign exchange student.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.666
Oh, wow.

16:08.668 --> 16:09.867
Thanks, Maddie.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.169
You fixed me.

16:11.171 --> 16:14.706
Everything that happens
from this point forward

16:14.708 --> 16:16.674
is because of you.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.678
The first time
I play matchmaker

16:20.680 --> 16:24.148
and my brother wants
to ask out our sister.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.217
Bam! What have I done?

16:33.492 --> 16:35.760
Having a good time tonight,
sunflower?

16:35.762 --> 16:37.929
Of course I am.
It's scream fest.

16:37.931 --> 16:41.232
And I just won
best homemade costume.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.503
And I'm about to find
my friend Liv Rooney.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.740
She's very close.
I can feel it.

16:48.742 --> 16:51.609
She might be closer
than you think.

16:51.611 --> 16:52.810
You're right.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.979
Werewolf dead ahead.
I bet that's her.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.614
Liv Rooney.
Liv Rooney, Rooney.

16:56.616 --> 16:57.715
<i>Liv Rooney.</i>

17:00.019 --> 17:02.353
Uh, I have been looking
for you everywhere.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.155
Major disaster.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.657
Joey digs the kangaroo lady.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.793
Wow, a little coincidoodle

17:08.795 --> 17:11.763
that someone else showed up
in a lady kangaroo outfit.

17:11.765 --> 17:14.565
Nope, just you.

17:15.534 --> 17:18.736
( Retches, gulps )

17:18.738 --> 17:20.872
( Coughs )

17:20.874 --> 17:23.174
You were supposed to let him
practice talking to girls,

17:23.176 --> 17:24.575
not get him crushing on you.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.544
I didn't do it.
The kangaroo did.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.280
Bad kangaroo!

17:29.282 --> 17:31.649
( With aussie accent )
G'day, Sandy.

17:33.085 --> 17:36.054
Um, Joey, you should...

17:36.056 --> 17:38.122
Maddie, you taught me well,

17:38.124 --> 17:40.124
but I am standing
on the cliff of romance

17:40.126 --> 17:41.559
ready to fly.

17:45.764 --> 17:47.732
I had a great time tonight.

17:47.734 --> 17:51.602
What do you say?
You, me, fro-yo?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.938
Anything you want for under $7.

17:56.608 --> 17:58.142
I feel like we have a...

17:58.144 --> 17:59.677
( whispers )
A special connection.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.747
( Screams )

18:03.816 --> 18:05.817
Oh my, look at the time.

18:05.819 --> 18:08.086
Got to go.

18:09.054 --> 18:10.354
So what do you think?

18:10.356 --> 18:13.324
Mom is going to love her.

18:16.361 --> 18:19.063
Trick-or-treating
is not what it used to be.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.665
Erasers...

18:22.167 --> 18:24.936
Apples...

18:24.938 --> 18:26.971
Magic markers?

18:26.973 --> 18:29.740
Anything not covered
in chocolate is a rip.

18:30.976 --> 18:32.743
Where's peppino?

18:32.745 --> 18:34.979
Peppino's gone?

18:34.981 --> 18:37.081
How'd those creeps
get past my traps?

18:37.083 --> 18:39.750
Honey, somebody stole
peppino again.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.386
What? No.
( Gasps )

18:42.388 --> 18:44.789
They took my baby again!

18:44.791 --> 18:47.725
Oh, peppino!

18:47.727 --> 18:49.961
Peppino!

18:57.903 --> 18:59.270
Okay, you win.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.072
You're a master of disguise.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.707
What were you dressed as?

19:02.709 --> 19:04.208
Okay, I'm gonna
give you a hint,

19:04.210 --> 19:05.309
but don't tell anyone.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.278
( With aussie accent )
This marsupial

19:07.280 --> 19:10.248
had a nice walkabout
with a perky sunflower.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.751
Liv Rooney,
you were the kangaroo!

19:13.753 --> 19:15.353
Shh!

19:19.224 --> 19:21.092
It was you?!

19:21.094 --> 19:23.728
You were the kangaroo?

19:27.065 --> 19:28.232
Don't feel bad.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.800
I didn't know
it was her either.

19:37.976 --> 19:40.811
- ( Evil laughter )
- ( Screams )

19:40.813 --> 19:43.214
Busted.

19:43.216 --> 19:47.285
the security video
and noticed a grim reaper

19:47.287 --> 19:49.253
was wearing a bracelet.

19:49.255 --> 19:53.391
that I got my wife
for our 10th anniversary.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.960
Maybe he stole it.

19:55.962 --> 19:59.063
But ultimately felt guilty
and returned it.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.866
I thought you loved peppino.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.835
Sweetheart, I despise peppino.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.438
You know, I'm not scared
by zombies, skeletons,

20:07.440 --> 20:09.340
vampires,
not even your parents.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.008
But...

20:11.010 --> 20:12.243
I can't help it.

20:12.245 --> 20:13.811
I am creeped out by clowns.

20:13.813 --> 20:17.848
So that's why you never
took me to the circus.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.384
How deep does this lie go?

20:20.386 --> 20:23.454
Babe, you should
have said something.

20:23.456 --> 20:26.357
But it reminds you
of our first date.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.292
I don't need peppino for that.

20:28.294 --> 20:30.161
I have you.

20:30.163 --> 20:31.796
If you're that
scared of clowns,

20:31.798 --> 20:33.497
consider him gone.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.099
Or....

20:35.101 --> 20:37.268
We could keep peppino
and get rid of mom.

20:39.204 --> 20:41.005
Consider him gone.

20:42.507 --> 20:44.408
You are so sweet.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.143
Thank you for understanding.

20:46.145 --> 20:48.045
Now chop that monster into bits

20:48.047 --> 20:49.880
and feed him to pigs.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.115
Just don't bring
the pigs around here

20:51.117 --> 20:52.850
'cause I'm...
I'm also afraid of pigs.

20:59.224 --> 21:02.293
Joey, can I try
saying sorry again?

21:03.495 --> 21:04.962
Will you at least talk to me?

21:04.964 --> 21:07.365
You know what
bothers me the most?

21:07.367 --> 21:09.433
I was fine just doing my thing,

21:09.435 --> 21:11.335
but that wasn't
good enough for you.

21:11.337 --> 21:13.271
So you had to come in
and mess with it.

21:14.539 --> 21:16.340
No, no, no.

21:16.342 --> 21:18.242
The fact that
I asked out my sister,

21:18.244 --> 21:20.511
that is definitely
what bothers me the most.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.382
You're right.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.017
I shouldn't have
tried to change you

21:26.019 --> 21:28.319
because you're an amazing guy.

21:28.321 --> 21:31.355
And this beat that you
skip to is really special.

21:31.357 --> 21:33.391
And you are going
to find someone amazing

21:33.393 --> 21:35.092
without me butting in.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.160
Whatever.

21:36.162 --> 21:37.995
It's too little, too late.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.330
I'm gonna leave
this conversation

21:39.332 --> 21:40.965
on a low note.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.501
( In a deep pitch ) ¶ low...

21:49.541 --> 21:52.543
Whoa, is that the cyborg spy

21:52.545 --> 21:54.011
from "tongue of the phantom"?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.980
That's my favorite video game.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.883
Your favorite game?

21:58.885 --> 22:00.851
You play multiple video games?

22:00.853 --> 22:03.587
When I'm not reading
graphic novels.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.357
I'm skyler.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.292
I'm speechless.

22:09.294 --> 22:11.262
And also, my name is Joey.

22:11.264 --> 22:12.330
Just...

22:12.332 --> 22:14.865
just give me one second.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.135
Skyler is talking
to regular old

22:18.137 --> 22:19.403
video-game-playing Joey

22:19.405 --> 22:21.472
who was just being himself.

22:21.474 --> 22:22.406
Booyah!

22:25.944 --> 22:28.212
So, hey, girl.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.383
Any interest
in joining robotics club?

22:32.385 --> 22:35.886
We could use
more female members...

22:35.888 --> 22:37.221
Or one.

22:43.495 --> 22:45.896
Oh, is it done?

22:45.898 --> 22:47.865
Yes, we took peppino
to the lumber yard,

22:47.867 --> 22:48.933
put him in a wood chipper.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.301
( Sighs )

22:50.303 --> 22:51.902
Oh that must have
been hard for you, Parker.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.237
You really loved him.

22:53.239 --> 22:54.405
Are you kidding me?

22:54.407 --> 22:55.873
He came flying out.

22:55.875 --> 22:59.009
Green hair and clown chunks
everywhere.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.145
So awesome.

23:02.514 --> 23:03.581
Come on.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.449
Let's watch the movie.

23:11.256 --> 23:13.491
( Evil laugh )
