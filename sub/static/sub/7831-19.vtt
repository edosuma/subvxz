13:20.566 --> 13:23.057
[Imitating Whale]
Thank you.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.865
Tell me, young man.
What do you want out of life?

13:25.971 --> 13:29.907
- I want peas.
- [Chuckles] We all want peace!

13:30.009 --> 13:31.909
But it's always just out of reach.

13:32.011 --> 13:36.471
- Oh! Uh-huh.
- So, what's the best way to get peace?

13:36.582 --> 13:38.777
- With a knife!
- Exactly!

13:38.884 --> 13:41.853
Not with the olive branch,
but the bayonet.

13:41.954 --> 13:45.913
[Chuckling] Oh, Simpson!
You're like the son I never had.

13:46.025 --> 13:48.755
And you're like
the father I never visit.

13:48.861 --> 13:50.761
Sir! I was running a diagnostic...

13:50.863 --> 13:52.922
and there was an obstruction
in torpedo tube number one.

13:53.032 --> 13:54.932

What the hell. Simpson!

13:57.469 --> 13:59.664
- While I'm gone, you're in command.
- Me?

13:59.772 --> 14:03.401
- Him?
- Yes. Maybe it's the salt water in my veins...

14:03.509 --> 14:06.171
or the nitrogen bubbles
in my brain...

14:06.278 --> 14:08.405
but I've taken a real shine to you.

14:13.385 --> 14:15.319
Seaman, open that torpedo tube.

14:15.421 --> 14:19.118
You'll never get a response
talking to my son like that.

14:19.225 --> 14:21.955

Homer, we got an enemy sub,
closing in fast.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.512
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

14:45.117 --> 14:47.415
Fifteen seconds to collision.
We need a decision.

14:47.519 --> 14:50.079
Hmm. What would
the captain say in my spot?

14:50.189 --> 14:54.250
- Don't fire the torpedoes!
- Fire the torpedoes!

14:54.360 --> 14:58.490
[Captain Groaning]

14:58.597 --> 15:01.964

15:30.796 --> 15:32.531
You just shot the captain
out of the torpedo tube.

You just shot the captain

- That means you're in charge, Homer.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.537

- [Sighs] Those were the orders.

15:44.043 --> 15:47.206
Very well, then.
I'm a captain.

15:47.313 --> 15:50.510
Mr. Moe, steady as she goes.

- Radio, out.
- Enough of what's out. What's in?

16:13.405 --> 16:15.805
Ice-blended mocha drinks
and David Schwimmer.

16:15.908 --> 16:19.309
Yes, he is handsome
in an ugly sort of way.

16:19.411 --> 16:22.346
Captain, how are we supposed
to get home with no equipment?

16:22.448 --> 16:24.575
Don't worry.
I've been workir on it.

16:24.683 --> 16:27.550

Carry the two-

16:31.991 --> 16:34.050
All right.
I can't waste any more time.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.093

- Aye, aye, Captain.

Well, sir, "treason season"
started early this year...

17:07.358 --> 17:10.795
as a nuclear sub was hijacked
by local man Homer Simpson.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.625
Oh, my God!

17:12.731 --> 17:14.961
I told him that photo
would come back to haunt him.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.535
Could Homer Simpson be a Communist?

17:17.636 --> 17:19.536
His father spoke out on his behalf.

17:19.637 --> 17:22.402
My Homer is not a Communist.

17:22.508 --> 17:27.207
He may be a liar, a pig, an idiot,
a Communist-

17:27.311 --> 17:30.748
But he is not a porn star!

17:36.121 --> 17:38.089
It's over there.

17:40.159 --> 17:43.754
The Soviet Union will be pleased to offer
amnesty to your wayward "wessel."

I thought you guys broke up.

18:36.248 --> 18:39.274
Captain, the renegade sub
is directly below us.

18:39.384 --> 18:42.979

a clear, nonalcoholic liquid.

18:56.368 --> 18:58.563

- Yeah, that's it.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.104

Ladies and gentlemen...

20:10.909 --> 20:13.571
- You wanna stop callir me Mr. Moe?
- No.

20:27.626 --> 20:31.289
Attention, Homer Simpson. You have
10 seconds to explain your actions...

20:31.396 --> 20:35.856

20:47.613 --> 20:49.843

20:54.620 --> 20:56.952
Seaman Simpson, your actions
have given the Navy...

20:57.055 --> 20:59.023
a black eye from which
it may never recover.

20:59.124 --> 21:03.254
I would throw the book at you, but
I've been indicted in the Tailhook scandal.

21:03.362 --> 21:06.456
- Good-bye.
- I, too, would punish you...

21:06.565 --> 21:10.296
but I'm under indictment for accepting
bribes from military contractors.

21:11.703 --> 21:14.536
Um, I torpedoed
a Carnival Cruise ship.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.200
Impersonating the first lady.

21:19.177 --> 21:22.374
- I think you're off the hook.
- Whoo-hoo!

21:25.450 --> 21:30.114
A dishonorable discharge.
That's the best we could have hoped for.

21:30.222 --> 21:33.714
You can't spell "dishonorable"
without "honorable."

21:33.825 --> 21:35.850
I think you're a hero, Dad.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.191
Well, I couldn't have
done it without Bart.

21:38.297 --> 21:42.131
Boy, I guess I was wrong about
that earring. It saved us all.

21:42.234 --> 21:44.725
Then can I get a tattoo that says,
"Bite me"?

21:44.836 --> 21:46.827
You never know when
it might come in handy.

21:46.938 --> 21:48.838
- I don't think so, Son.
- A king cobra?

21:48.940 --> 21:50.339
