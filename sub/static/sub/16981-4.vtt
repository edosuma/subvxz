00:02.000 --> 00:03.920
This programme contains some strong language.

00:03.920 --> 00:06.600
It's a risk, but Jesse is worth the risk. We're so close. It's my work.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.320
I need to get it back, and I can't do it alone.

00:08.320 --> 00:10.440
He opens it, what sort of trouble is he getting into?

00:10.440 --> 00:11.880
Cos the strength of that encryption

00:11.880 --> 00:13.520
suggests that whoever you stole it from

00:13.520 --> 00:15.280
is pretty invested in keeping it unopened.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.040
I think "stole" is the wrong word.

00:17.040 --> 00:20.360
Jan Roth used to work for Offensive Cyber Ops.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.920
They're one of the hardest-core intelligence units

00:22.920 --> 00:26.200
working for the American government.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.480
- How's Alyse? 
- She's good.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.280
She's applied for this design degree.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.400
I think this is going to really turn things around for her.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.440
Hello, Hani.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.000
WILL: We grant asylum to the leader

00:37.000 --> 00:39.080
of one of Indonesia's designated terrorist groups,

00:39.080 --> 00:40.680
they're going to pop an artery.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.360
- One man's terrorist... 
- Is another man's freedom fighter.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.880
This is the man accused of killing

00:44.880 --> 00:46.920
Eric Bell and Christo Borst in West Papua,

00:46.920 --> 00:49.600
shot with a single bullet to the forehead.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.240
The Minister's not making statements to the press.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.360
She's been sold a lie!

00:53.360 --> 00:55.400
Gary decided to use my website

00:55.400 --> 00:57.560
to open up a fun park for paedophiles.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.320
- HE GRUNTS 
- Fuck!

01:00.720 --> 01:04.280
This is an extradition order for both of us. I thought we had a deal.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.440
- I know. 
- This is Lara, isn't it?

01:06.440 --> 01:10.480
- HANI: 
- Mama joon, what's going on? 
- Baba's visa has been cancelled.

01:10.480 --> 01:13.320
I'm going to try to fix things.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.880
I'm going to get the files they want and trade them for your dad.

GENERAL HUBBUB

01:39.680 --> 01:40.920
GUNSHOT

03:25.360 --> 03:26.400
You OK?

03:27.640 --> 03:29.640
- Can we not do that? 
- Do what?

03:29.640 --> 03:32.120
The "Jesse, are you OK?" "Yes, I am."

03:32.120 --> 03:34.080
"Are you sure?" "Yes, I'm sure."

03:34.080 --> 03:36.280
ad nauseum thing that we do.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.480
Sure.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.000
Do you want to, er, go through

03:39.000 --> 03:40.800
what we're going to say to Roth one more time?

03:40.800 --> 03:42.080
No, I don't want to go over it.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.600
I'm so tired I don't even know what language you're speaking.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.200
We just stick close to the truth.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.720
The extradition warrants were served and we needed to get out of there.

03:49.720 --> 03:53.600
Could've sworn I said, "No, I don't want to go over it."

03:53.600 --> 03:56.160
Maybe I just said it in my head.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.960
No, no, no. You said it out loud. I just ignored you.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.800
- Didn't she say that they were no longer... 
- What?

04:03.800 --> 04:07.160
"Attached" was the word she used. That looks kind of attached to me.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.200
Sometimes, when you break up with someone,

04:09.200 --> 04:10.720
you know, not everything dies.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.240
Sometimes you still want to hug that person for ten minutes, eh?

04:13.240 --> 04:15.160
Hasn't been ten minutes.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.640
See? Hugging over.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.160
So you're sure he won't mention this little unscheduled detour

04:30.160 --> 04:31.640
in his flight log?

04:31.640 --> 04:33.200
What unscheduled detour?

04:34.440 --> 04:37.000
Pretty big favour, given what would happen if he got busted.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.080
He gets rewarded well enough.

04:45.480 --> 04:48.880
Now we just have to hope that Budi turns up before anyone else does.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.800
I gave some people my word,

04:59.800 --> 05:02.280
and because that's not worth a pinch of shit to you lot,

05:02.280 --> 05:04.760
they've gone and got themselves into a much worse situation.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.480
Oh, really, Nolan, I'm flattered you think I wield so much power.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.200
Which is quite a different answer from,

05:09.200 --> 05:11.720
"I didn't have Nasim Parande's visa cancelled."

05:14.560 --> 05:19.200
I know you don't like it, but there is a line in the sand.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.480
Jesse Banks was your responsibility

05:21.480 --> 05:23.640
as long as he was contributing to the Callum case.

05:23.640 --> 05:27.040
In relation to everything else, he's my responsibility.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.720
- Oh. 
- Your job here is done, Nolan.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.720
I know it hasn't always been smooth sailing

05:32.720 --> 05:35.600
but I really hope we can cross swords sometime in the future.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.280
I think you're meant to say "cross paths."

05:37.280 --> 05:40.640
- Slip of the tongue. 
- I don't believe in 'em.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.880
Oh, Constable Freud, is it?

05:44.440 --> 05:47.120
Detective, if you want to get all formal.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.840
DOOR CLATTERS KEY RATTLES IN LOCK

05:57.360 --> 06:01.920
NASIM: I spoke to the Legal Aid solicitor this morning.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.160
He's put in the application

06:04.160 --> 06:08.480
to challenge the cancellation of my visa, but...

06:08.480 --> 06:11.320
- What? 
- He didn't sound very confident.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.400
He also sounded 14. HE CHUCKLES

06:15.800 --> 06:20.000
We need someone who specialises in immigration law, Baba.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.120
Mama joon and I spoke to a couple of barristers this morning.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.600
One of them is very good.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.200
We cannot afford it.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.520
There's nearly 20,000 left in my uni fund.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.840
- No, this is your future. 
- Baba, I don't care!

06:33.840 --> 06:36.280
No, Hani, I don't want it to be like this.

06:36.280 --> 06:38.440
But we don't have an alternative.

06:41.240 --> 06:43.760
- CLEARS THROAT 
- I, um...

06:45.240 --> 06:49.040
I spoke to Navid yesterday

06:49.040 --> 06:54.320
and, um, he has a friend at the Persian Times, an editor,

06:54.320 --> 06:57.320
and they're interested in our story, so...

06:57.320 --> 06:59.880
No, this is not how it is going to be.

06:59.880 --> 07:04.160
If we fight, it will only make your situation more dangerous.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.560
- They will target you. 
- I don't care!

07:06.560 --> 07:08.160
I care!

07:08.160 --> 07:11.760
I'm telling you, Alilah, it will make more trouble.

07:13.520 --> 07:17.560
The second - the second - we are silenced

07:17.560 --> 07:21.000
because we are scared of making more trouble,

07:21.000 --> 07:22.960
in that moment, they've won.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.440
You will not do this. We wait.

07:25.440 --> 07:29.280
We follow procedure and we pray that this will work out.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.640
- No. I'm talking to them. 
- No!

07:34.640 --> 07:37.640
As your husband, I forbid it.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.480
This is not the talk of a man that I married.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.080
Yeah.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.720
Talk to her, yeah? Talk to her. HE SOBS

08:22.640 --> 08:27.640
"Marina Baxter, laughing in the face of the UN Refugee Convention."

08:27.640 --> 08:30.120
Please, can you just take a proper look at the site?

08:30.120 --> 08:33.559
We're talking "Obama and Putin are lizards from outer space

08:33.559 --> 08:35.760
"carrying out their crazy lizard war here on Earth."

08:35.760 --> 08:37.240
I mean, it's...it's hilarious.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.000
I think the thing to focus on

08:39.000 --> 08:41.400
is that the photos were sent to all of the majors

08:41.400 --> 08:43.120
and no-one bit - not one.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.760
We sent Remsey Gangi and his family back

08:45.760 --> 08:47.680
under the Memorandum of Understanding

08:47.680 --> 08:50.240
and that picture proves - and I quote -

08:50.240 --> 08:53.440
"There can be no doubt that the Minister knew the Gangi family

08:53.440 --> 08:56.400
"were in direct flight from persecution."

08:56.400 --> 08:58.720
No, those pictures don't prove that at all.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.840
Those pictures prove that there were questions to be asked about the case

09:01.840 --> 09:03.200
and you asked them.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.280
You did exactly what was required of you

09:05.280 --> 09:08.000
and, thankfully, any questions that come up now

09:08.000 --> 09:10.240
can be legitimately handballed to Immigration.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.360
And that makes it OK, does it?

09:12.360 --> 09:15.240
Thank goodness those thorny questions

09:15.240 --> 09:16.840
don't belong to us any more.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.720
It makes your position tenable, Minister.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.520
I'll be in in 20 minutes. We'll talk about it then.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.000
- Excuse me? 
- Can I help you?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Hi. I'm, er...

09:43.000 --> 09:46.640
I...I want to talk to someone about my daughter.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.840
- She's applying for the design degree. 
- Mm-hm.

09:48.840 --> 09:52.560
And she was unable to get to the interview yesterday.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.760
Her name's Alyse Baxter.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.280
Yeah. She didn't turn up to her interview.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.200
Yeah, as I said, she was unable to attend

10:06.200 --> 10:08.400
so I'm just looking to make another time.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.960
- SHE SCOFFS 
- Well, there are no provisions for second interviews.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.160
- It's clear in the course outline. 
- Yeah, I read that.

10:16.120 --> 10:21.000
I just, um... I just don't think it applies in this instance.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.680
Clause 7 of the application outline is very clear.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.600
We don't reschedule interviews.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.640
Maybe I'm taking it too far,

10:47.640 --> 10:50.600
but Roth worked for this high-level cyber unit in the US.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.600
Just thinking about the files he took -

10:52.600 --> 10:56.400
you're pitching "disgruntled employee leaves with a cardboard box

10:56.400 --> 10:58.720
"full of things he's not entitled to take home."

10:58.720 --> 11:01.480
That would account for the keenness to get them back.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.800
Mm-hm. Unless there's a different agenda running.

11:06.240 --> 11:10.440
What if he gets the sack and goes off the radar?

11:10.440 --> 11:12.360
What do you mean, they stage his exit

11:12.360 --> 11:14.920
and he pops up here, like some kind of sleeper agent?

11:14.920 --> 11:16.400
Nuts?

11:16.400 --> 11:18.680
Indonesia is incredibly important to the US

11:18.680 --> 11:20.120
in terms of regional security,

11:20.120 --> 11:22.560
maybe even more important than Australia in the long run.

11:22.560 --> 11:26.360
That would make the whole thing with Kiki and Tahila a lie.

11:27.400 --> 11:31.360
I know I have a somewhat limited catalogue of experience

11:31.360 --> 11:33.240
by which to assess these things,

11:33.240 --> 11:34.760
but he loves her.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.960
Loves 'em both.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.160
Yeah, it's him.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.000
Is he reliable, your guy?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.920
He's the best fixer I've ever worked with

11:51.920 --> 11:54.200
and the risk for him is extraordinary.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.080
More or less than yours if you get busted?

11:56.080 --> 11:59.640
Much more. I'm a foreign spy. He's one of their own.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.200
You remember Jesse. This is Ned.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.040
- Ned, Budi. 
- Hi, Budi.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.120
There's a roadblock 2km up. That's why I'm late.

12:17.120 --> 12:20.760
- Oh, great. 
- Is there another way out?

12:21.800 --> 12:24.000
So do we just wait for them to go, or...?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.200
They could stay there all week.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.440
A patrol on foot could come through here any time.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.600
It's better to meet it head on.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.920
I told them you were taking pictures for the mine

12:32.920 --> 12:34.560
and you hired me to pick you up.

12:34.560 --> 12:37.040
And what did you say about us?

12:37.040 --> 12:39.880
Nothing. You won't be in the car.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.960
- What's happening? 
- Shh!

13:02.960 --> 13:05.840
- Why are we stopping? 
- I need you to be quiet, Jesse.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.520
- Selamat sore. 
- Paper!

13:18.720 --> 13:20.560
SPEAKS INDONESIAN

13:20.560 --> 13:23.200
He asks what's the purpose for you being out here is.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.120
I am taking photos of the mine,

13:26.120 --> 13:28.640
photos for the new exploration fields.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.320
SPEAKS INDONESIAN

13:39.520 --> 13:41.200
He wants to see your camera.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.000
He's calling the mine.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.120
- (What's going on?) 
- Shh. I need you to be quiet, Jess.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.240
I need to know what's going on because I need to know

14:17.240 --> 14:19.760
how long I'm going to be breathing this air for.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.440
It's burning my nose, Ned. It's burning my nose.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.600
- I can't breathe and I'm boiling... 
- Shh! Jesse! Jesse!

14:24.600 --> 14:26.320
I need you to listen, OK?

14:26.320 --> 14:29.400
You need to think of something that'll take you somewhere good, OK?

14:33.560 --> 14:35.080
(It's OK.)

14:52.600 --> 14:54.600
THUD! HE GASPS

15:04.760 --> 15:07.680
SPEAKS INDONESIAN

15:10.240 --> 15:13.400
He's recommending the wisdom of you registering your trips

15:13.400 --> 15:16.480
with the local authorities in the future.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.480
Terima kasih. Terima kasih banyak.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.440
ENGINE STARTS

15:38.280 --> 15:40.280
JESSE GRUNTS

15:41.960 --> 15:43.600
BANGING

15:48.480 --> 15:50.040
BANGING CONTINUES

15:53.520 --> 15:56.680
HE HYPERVENTILATES

15:56.680 --> 16:00.000
Slow down, buddy. Slow down.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.800
HE COUGHS

16:31.560 --> 16:33.120
Hi. It's me.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.280
Sorry, that was a moronic thing to say,

16:37.280 --> 16:41.520
unless, of course, you've gone blind since I saw you last.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.240
I'm assuming you haven't.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.320
This is my brother, Ned.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.920
- Did you find the boy? 
- We did.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.840
Good. That's good.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.920
Thanks for the tip-off.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.680
It was the least I could do.

17:10.640 --> 17:11.920
Why are you back?

17:14.800 --> 17:17.440
The police served our extradition warrants.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.560
We decided to run.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.440
Jesse said you'd offered him 20K in Bitcoin for...

17:22.440 --> 17:26.040
- 25 was where we landed. 
- 25.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.200
..for a decryption job.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.840
We need money. We need new passports.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.760
We thought we could help each other out.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.640
You hungry?

17:44.600 --> 17:46.160
So how did you get out?

17:46.160 --> 17:48.600
Meg's friend, Peter, he...

17:48.600 --> 17:52.600
No, I meant the Canberra Stasi. How did you slip their leash?

17:53.560 --> 17:56.760
I, um... I don't really know.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.680
I imagine they had pretty tight reins on you.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.160
I'm just curious to know.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.560
Unless they wanted you to come.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.880
Maybe they were hoping to hitch a ride.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.640
I-I don't have an answer. I just came here...

18:11.640 --> 18:13.840
As soon as we knew that Meg could get us on the plane,

18:13.840 --> 18:15.320
we switched mobiles and laptops

18:15.320 --> 18:17.080
and didn't make a peep till we were in the air.

18:17.080 --> 18:18.560
No-one hitched a ride with us.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.080
If you'd be so kind, Ned,

18:21.080 --> 18:24.560
would you mind letting Jesse answer the question?

18:24.560 --> 18:26.640
As unhospitable as it may seem,

18:26.640 --> 18:28.320
I just need to determine

18:28.320 --> 18:30.320
whether I'm being sold a lot of bullshit here.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.560
And the fact that you can't look me in the eye,

18:35.560 --> 18:37.080
it's making me uneasy.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.800
The truth is, I'm finding it hard to look at you

18:42.800 --> 18:46.880
without seeing what happened last time I saw you.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.040
How rude of me.

18:56.040 --> 19:00.240
I haven't offered you any food, Ned. Please help yourself.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.520
Jesse?

19:06.040 --> 19:09.400
- You all right? 
- I prefer we stay together.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.440
Not necessary.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.320
Even so.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.480
I'll... I'd concentrate better if he came.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.880
If you're just going to stand there,

19:58.880 --> 20:00.920
would you be so kind as to get us some beer?

20:04.320 --> 20:06.640
I promise not to do anything while you're away.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.560
What, like kill someone?

20:08.560 --> 20:09.840
Right.

20:11.160 --> 20:14.960
I promise not to kill anyone while you're out of the room.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.480
Beer's on the veranda, in the fridge.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.600
HE SIGHS

20:37.080 --> 20:40.840
That was not how I intended to broach the subject, but, um...

20:40.840 --> 20:44.640
I definitely was going to bring it up, but...

20:44.640 --> 20:47.920
I wish that I could take it all back, Jesse. I wish...

20:50.480 --> 20:53.600
I was angry. I wanted to scare him, and, um...

20:55.440 --> 20:57.400
..I wanted to hurt him, but...

20:58.560 --> 21:01.560
..I didn't intend for what happened.

21:03.640 --> 21:06.640
I know that doesn't make any difference, I know that...

21:09.120 --> 21:10.280
I'm sorry.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.880
I'm sorry I dragged you into the middle of it.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.640
DOOR CLATTERS

21:26.680 --> 21:28.200
Where's Jesse's beer?

21:28.200 --> 21:30.800
- CLEARS THROAT 
- He doesn't need a beer.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.960
Fuck me. Is he always this condescending?

21:32.960 --> 21:34.520
Not usually to my face,

21:34.520 --> 21:37.600
but we're under a bit of stress at the moment.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.760
Mm.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.920
Done.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.720
Chin down.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.640
John Brown.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.320
Why don't you go the whole way and make it Beige?

21:56.320 --> 21:59.680
It's not too late. Mr Beige works.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.920
- Who are you? 
- Claude LeMarr.

22:06.680 --> 22:09.080
- You didn't make us brothers? 
- No.

22:10.840 --> 22:13.760
Can't choose your family, right? That's what they say.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.440
But there is a window here.

22:16.440 --> 22:19.240
From this point on, you get to choose.

22:20.480 --> 22:24.120
Would you grow the same family tree without the soil of obligation?

22:42.800 --> 22:45.160
Lifted the picture off her Facebook page.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.760
I'm not sure what your plans are,

22:46.760 --> 22:48.360
whether she's going to join you or not,

22:48.360 --> 22:51.880
but I thought I would make her one up too, just in case.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.440
Endine LeMarr.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.760
Yes, I married you in a simple garden ceremony.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.440
It's your three-year anniversary

22:59.440 --> 23:02.160
and, um, Mr Beige here was your best man.

23:04.280 --> 23:07.160
You should marry her, Jesse, if you get the chance.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.640
You don't mind if I talk out loud?

23:10.640 --> 23:13.440
I'm just, you know, sharing my thoughts.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.120
I think Hani's great,

23:15.120 --> 23:17.000
but I probably wouldn't be so condescending

23:17.000 --> 23:18.880
as to tell someone who to marry.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.400
- ALILAH: 
- That's right. I have completely forgotten that day.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.880
- ANTON: 
- Maybe you were trying to forget.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.920
Hani? Hani, come here.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.760
Look. Look who popped in for a visit, huh?

23:52.280 --> 23:53.800
Hani?

23:55.280 --> 23:56.920
Hani!

23:58.200 --> 23:59.720
Hani, stop.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.000
What the fuck?

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
You come into my house and talk to my mother,

24:06.000 --> 24:07.720
after what your boss is doing to us?

24:07.720 --> 24:09.520
Guilty.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.040
SHE SCOFFS I don't want your jacket.

24:18.040 --> 24:21.440
I don't know if you noticed. We didn't cook this whole thing.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.840
We're just responding to what your mate dived into.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.160
He's not my mate. He's my boyfriend.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.240
Lara wants to, er... She wants you to reach out to him

24:31.240 --> 24:33.880
with us, obviously, on your shoulder.

24:33.880 --> 24:37.400
She thinks she'd be in a position to put in a good word for your dad.

24:38.360 --> 24:41.240
Much as I'm sure you'd like to drive a star picket through my chest,

24:41.240 --> 24:42.520
maybe you also get that

24:42.520 --> 24:46.000
Jesse is getting himself into very deep water.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.120
If Roth gets him to do what he wants,

24:51.120 --> 24:53.400
there's nothing we can do to help him.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.760
MEG: Yeah, yeah. I'm still here.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.600
OK.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.720
Remsey's in the cells in town.

25:19.720 --> 25:23.720
Budi thinks that he can get someone there in to see him.

25:23.720 --> 25:26.960
- You can't go. 
- Well, you can't go.

25:31.480 --> 25:34.440
- NED: 
- So Roth pays the bribe but he's not allowed in?

25:34.440 --> 25:35.920
Yep.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.040
Well, then there's the fact

25:37.040 --> 25:39.520
that he wouldn't be Remsey's first visitor of choice anyway.

25:42.520 --> 25:46.560
Roth's all too Black Panther to Remsey's Martin Luther King.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.560
They're agreed on the outcome,

25:48.560 --> 25:51.640
but not whether to get there via the ballot or the bullet.

25:53.640 --> 25:55.960
We're good. Go to the back door.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.880
Wait five minutes. Someone will let you in.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.080
Oh, God. Remsey!

26:14.080 --> 26:16.480
I'm OK.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.040
It's OK.

26:20.840 --> 26:24.200
This is Ned. He's been helping me try to get the story out.

26:27.640 --> 26:32.480
- And Gracie and the kids? 
- They're home. Kiki's with them.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.520
They're fine. HE SIGHS

26:36.920 --> 26:39.360
You have to tell Theo to step up.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.400
Now's the time.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.120
This is a letter.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.280
I want him to put it on the site...

26:52.960 --> 26:55.280
..so everyone knows what has happened here.

26:55.280 --> 26:59.520
And then he must step up and talk sense,

26:59.520 --> 27:01.600
so that things don't get out of hand.

27:01.600 --> 27:05.280
If he doesn't do it, people will start listening to Jan.

27:05.280 --> 27:08.160
Did he say what he was planning?

27:08.160 --> 27:10.720
He's asked my brother to decrypt some files.

27:10.720 --> 27:12.360
We don't know what's on them

27:12.360 --> 27:14.120
but, whatever it is, it's made the police

27:14.120 --> 27:16.080
and the government in Australia very worried.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.000
He talks big.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.600
He talks about sending a message to the world,

27:20.600 --> 27:22.720
something that will make them sit up

27:22.720 --> 27:24.800
and take an interest in what is happening here.

27:24.800 --> 27:27.080
What does that mean? Did he say how?

27:27.080 --> 27:31.160
Most of the time, I'm trying not to hear his talk.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.800
It's not the way.

27:32.800 --> 27:36.440
We provoke them, then, when they say we are terrorists,

27:36.440 --> 27:38.040
they are right.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.040
Can I?

27:48.040 --> 27:51.320
You cannot show Grace or Kiki.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.720
Or Jan.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.160
JESSE: Do you think you could sit down?

28:22.160 --> 28:24.160
What? Am I bothering you?

28:27.160 --> 28:30.280
Better still, perhaps you could pace about outside.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.080
This encryption's insane.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.360
I'm never going to crack it.

28:40.560 --> 28:42.560
Ever been stoned, Jesse?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.320
As in stoned with marijuana?

28:46.320 --> 28:48.720
As in stoned with marijuana.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.600
I can't say I have. No.

28:52.520 --> 28:53.560
Hmm...

29:20.200 --> 29:24.400
# If...

29:24.400 --> 29:26.600
# I had a donkey and he wouldn't go

29:26.600 --> 29:28.760
# You think I'd beat him? No, no, no... #

29:28.760 --> 29:31.240
- Sing along if you know the words. 
- Nope.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.120
# Give it some hay Give it some corn

29:34.120 --> 29:37.000
# Best little donkey ever was born! #

29:37.000 --> 29:38.600
- Oh! 
- Gee up, Neddy! HE CHUCKLES

29:40.440 --> 29:42.840
Can't believe you don't know it!

29:43.960 --> 29:46.760
Sadly missing from my musical catalogue.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.480
Oh!

29:49.480 --> 29:51.800
The floor was way closer than I was expecting.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.240
Oh, fuck! Here.

29:55.280 --> 29:59.080
Wow. How did you know? HE LAUGHS

29:59.080 --> 30:02.120
My tongue has somehow been stuck to the roof of my mouth

30:02.120 --> 30:04.680
and I was thinking about how much money I would pay

30:04.680 --> 30:07.560
to someone that would help reverse that.

30:07.560 --> 30:10.280
- Suddenly, beer appears. 
- Magic!

30:10.280 --> 30:14.760
It's like you were inside my brain. HE CHUCKLES

30:14.760 --> 30:16.720
Hmm!

30:16.720 --> 30:20.040
Hey, listen, are you with me?

30:20.040 --> 30:23.480
- Am I with you? 
- Yes. Are you with me?

30:23.480 --> 30:25.400
I can see you're talking to me...

30:27.120 --> 30:29.600
..but the audio seems to be coming from the light bulb.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.320
HE LAUGHS

30:33.520 --> 30:36.000
Let me ask you something.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.320
Why did you come back, huh?

30:38.320 --> 30:40.640
Why did you really come back?

30:52.280 --> 30:56.160
BEEPING

30:56.160 --> 30:58.640
Someone's coming.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.000
Right?

31:02.760 --> 31:04.680
That's what's happening?

31:07.080 --> 31:08.600
Yeah.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.080
That's what's happening.

31:26.680 --> 31:30.720
- He's in good spirits, but... 
- You take any pictures?

31:30.720 --> 31:33.280
Well, there wasn't really much opportunity.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.000
Really?

31:35.000 --> 31:36.760
So, you don't have an SD card hidden away

31:36.760 --> 31:39.000
in your sock or your shoe or wherever the fuck you keep it?

31:40.920 --> 31:42.240
Seriously?

31:43.800 --> 31:46.760
You're going to stand there and lie to my face?

31:46.760 --> 31:49.000
He doesn't want everyone freaking out.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.200
Oh.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.160
Well, while he's busy not wanting people to freak out,

31:54.160 --> 31:57.120
he's getting used as a punching bag from now to Christ knows when,

31:57.120 --> 31:58.760
and I'm here.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.920
I don't think he's the best judge of anything.

32:04.040 --> 32:07.680
- He doesn't want Kiki to see. 
- The man's a rocket scientist.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.840
HE SIGHS

32:38.680 --> 32:39.960
Jan?

32:46.600 --> 32:47.640
How bad?

32:50.720 --> 32:52.320
He's in good spirits.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.760
SHE SIGHS

32:56.400 --> 32:57.640
He wants to make sure...

32:57.640 --> 33:00.280
That I don't step in and stir anything up

33:00.280 --> 33:02.840
because God forbid that we draw a line in the sand

33:02.840 --> 33:04.280
and say enough is enough.

33:06.600 --> 33:10.880
We are going to protest about it in the morning,

33:10.880 --> 33:13.000
in town.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.320
Come, Tahila.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.760
Can you get me a secure line to Canberra?

33:28.720 --> 33:29.920
Why?

33:29.920 --> 33:32.800
The only reason Remsey's there is because we sent him back.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.360
I want them to see what happens when they tick the right boxes.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.120
Really? Are you that naive?

33:37.120 --> 33:38.600
You don't think that

33:38.600 --> 33:41.280
she sends pictures every week that should be on the front page?

33:41.280 --> 33:44.120
Did you see pictures of Marcus being published

33:44.120 --> 33:47.160
or any from the week before that or the week before that

33:47.160 --> 33:49.000
or the 300 that are proof

33:49.000 --> 33:52.480
that people are being hacked to pieces and shot in the street?

33:54.840 --> 33:58.520
They only show up on social media for a reason.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.520
Are you drunk?

34:14.199 --> 34:15.679
I did have one beer

34:15.679 --> 34:21.280
but I think "stoned" is the correct descriptor for my current state.

34:34.679 --> 34:37.639
Ooh, um... Um, um, um...

34:37.639 --> 34:40.679
- Oh, I've got decision fatigue. 
- You'll have tangerine.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.960
Really? Will I?

34:42.960 --> 34:45.360
Come on. Out with it. It's killing me.

34:46.520 --> 34:50.239
- SHE LAUGHS 
- Come on! What?

34:50.239 --> 34:52.600
Well, you know how much I hate

34:52.600 --> 34:54.920
your "everything happens for a reason" crap?

34:54.920 --> 34:59.040
- Yeah, I'm aware of that. 
- Well, I think I'm almost converted.

34:59.040 --> 35:02.320
Oh, my God, Alyse. This is doing my head in. What happened?

35:02.320 --> 35:05.520
I got a call from the uni this afternoon.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.120
They've given me a scholarship.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.280
What do you mean they've given you a scholarship?

35:10.280 --> 35:12.640
Well, they must've had another look at the application

35:12.640 --> 35:15.560
cos I didn't show up, and decided they had to have me.

35:15.560 --> 35:18.840
But you...you only applied for a place in the course.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.320
You didn't apply for a scholarship.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.760
- Did... Did they say why? 
- Nope.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.640
I don't understand. They must've given you a reason.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.280
I'm not going to argue, Mum.

35:30.280 --> 35:32.720
If they want to pay for my degree, they can pay for my degree.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.520
I thought you'd be happy for me.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.520
I am, sweetheart. I'm thrilled.

35:39.520 --> 35:43.440
Just...I'm surprised, that's all.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.440
MESSAGE ALERT

35:54.680 --> 35:55.720
Give me a minute?

36:30.840 --> 36:34.080
PHONE VIBRATES

36:35.960 --> 36:37.640
Is he all right?

36:37.640 --> 36:40.480
He's exactly as he looks in the photographs.

36:40.480 --> 36:43.800
I can only assume, given that you've got access to these photographs,

36:43.800 --> 36:45.320
that you must be there.

36:45.320 --> 36:48.040
Well, I don't think that's the question of the hour

36:48.040 --> 36:49.720
and I think you know that.

36:49.720 --> 36:52.960
Right now, talking to you, you know what I should do?

36:52.960 --> 36:56.040
Hang up right now, ring this in and tell them you contacted me

36:56.040 --> 36:58.840
and that there's every chance that you're in West Papua

36:58.840 --> 37:01.640
in close proximity to where Remsey's being held.

37:01.640 --> 37:03.560
And yet the fact that you haven't done that

37:03.560 --> 37:05.560
makes me think you were the right one to call.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.000
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

37:15.000 --> 37:18.440
Celebratory spliff, was it? Managed to copy the files?

37:20.160 --> 37:24.040
Please don't. I'm not feeling very good.

37:37.040 --> 37:40.320
What was your answer about family?

37:40.320 --> 37:42.240
If you had a choice?

37:43.360 --> 37:44.840
It's a stupid question.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.560
Regardless, I want to know your answer.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.320
There is no answer,

37:49.320 --> 37:53.000
because the point of family and the kind of beauty of it

37:53.000 --> 37:56.560
is that you manage to love this person that you didn't choose

37:56.560 --> 37:59.000
and that's kind of what makes it more important.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.000
It takes more.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.040
It's harder work.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.840
Loving your friends, it's a doddle.

38:17.840 --> 38:20.160
You pick 'em because they're easy to love.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.160
I don't really have any friends.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.480
Is that weird?

38:28.600 --> 38:30.120
It's weird, isn't it?

38:37.360 --> 38:40.040
He wrote her letters, Dad...

38:41.920 --> 38:43.720
..when she was in the nursing home.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.520
After she got her diagnosis

38:45.520 --> 38:47.680
and she knew that her mind was going,

38:47.680 --> 38:50.640
she asked him to write down memories

38:50.640 --> 38:53.720
so that she'd have stuff to talk about with us.

38:54.920 --> 38:56.880
When I ate the spider's eggs,

38:56.880 --> 38:59.960
when you fell out the back of the blue car onto the road...

38:59.960 --> 39:01.880
I hated that car.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.440
When we went to the symphony for the first time.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.800
It's a nice thing for him to do.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.760
Hm.

39:16.960 --> 39:20.480
Hard for you to let him be good, isn't it?

40:01.600 --> 40:04.080
SOBBING

40:09.640 --> 40:12.960
SOBBING CONTINUES

40:34.680 --> 40:37.040
SHE SIGHS

41:07.800 --> 41:08.840
Hm.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.120
If you can copy the file today, then I can call Marina

41:30.120 --> 41:32.520
and see if she'll broker a deal for us and Hani's dad.

41:32.520 --> 41:34.360
And then what?

41:34.360 --> 41:36.080
Given that, I don't know,

41:36.080 --> 41:38.400
he spends a terrific amount of time in the bathroom

41:38.400 --> 41:40.080
and I actually CAN copy the file.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.720
I don't want to freak you out

41:41.720 --> 41:43.800
but I don't have the answers for everything.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.400
I'll going to file that under "I for irony."

41:48.800 --> 41:51.640
- MEG: 
- OK. Show on the road, I think.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.840
Is it hard not to go?

42:10.840 --> 42:14.240
No. That's not hard.

42:16.120 --> 42:19.600
What's hard is watching my wife bury half her family year after year

42:19.600 --> 42:21.120
and then not fighting back.

42:21.120 --> 42:23.040
I've made up my mind, Jesse.

42:24.440 --> 42:27.360
The time for playing small is over.

42:27.360 --> 42:30.120
I'm not sure I'm following you.

42:30.120 --> 42:33.880
We're not going to fuck around trying to decrypt the file any more.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.640
We're going back to steal the keys, Jess.

42:43.640 --> 42:46.000
One thing to try and decrypt something

42:46.000 --> 42:47.760
you might've found on the side of the road

42:47.760 --> 42:50.920
but...to break into somewhere like this?

42:50.920 --> 42:52.560
Mm. Very different.

42:52.560 --> 42:54.880
I know the kinds of things they do in there.

42:54.880 --> 42:57.800
It's not like breaking into the 7-11.

43:00.080 --> 43:03.520
- Consequences for me are... 
- For me too, Jesse.

43:03.520 --> 43:06.320
If we get busted in there and they get a fix on this location,

43:06.320 --> 43:08.000
it's game over.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.320
But it's a risk I have to take, so...sorry.

43:11.320 --> 43:12.400
Sorry for what?

43:14.440 --> 43:18.840
I made you do it. I attacked you and I forced you at gunpoint.

43:19.880 --> 43:21.400
You don't have a gun.

43:21.400 --> 43:23.000
I can get it out, if you want.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.360
No, thank you.

43:27.360 --> 43:28.720
Ow!

43:31.280 --> 43:33.000
Jesse?

43:38.960 --> 43:41.040
I need this, Jesse.

43:41.040 --> 43:44.120
Trying to crack the decryption could take forever

43:44.120 --> 43:46.560
and we're running out of time.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.600
Surely, since the initial theft,

43:56.600 --> 44:00.680
the security on the keys is going to be completely insane.

44:00.680 --> 44:01.720
Mm-hm.

44:04.960 --> 44:07.280
I've helped design the system

44:07.280 --> 44:10.520
so I can get us over the firewall and into someone's machine,

44:10.520 --> 44:12.360
but you're going to have to find the keys

44:12.360 --> 44:13.920
and you're going to have to do it fast.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.760
Distance has given me such a horrible perspective.

44:35.760 --> 44:39.320
- Of what? 
- Of just what a sucker I was.

44:39.320 --> 44:42.040
And all the horseshit that goes with it.

44:42.040 --> 44:44.520
"We're a family. We got your back."

44:46.080 --> 44:47.800
Ten years of my life.

44:51.960 --> 44:53.240
Hm.

44:56.160 --> 45:00.160
Only seven people inside the facility have access to the keys.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.960
Damon Jade.

45:06.040 --> 45:10.000
Ah, besides having a stupid name, Damon's a cat man.

45:11.520 --> 45:13.800
Let's see. What's her name?

45:13.800 --> 45:15.600
Chantelle?

45:15.600 --> 45:17.120
Charlize?

45:18.960 --> 45:22.160
- Constance. 
- HE CHUCKLES

45:22.160 --> 45:25.120
OK. Let me see her file.

45:26.080 --> 45:27.600
All right. Here we go.

45:28.680 --> 45:31.200
Dear Mr Jade,

45:31.200 --> 45:33.000
we're writing to all our clients

45:33.000 --> 45:37.520
whose pets underwent surgical procedures at the clinic

45:37.520 --> 45:39.520
in the last 12 months.

45:39.520 --> 45:42.480
We received a veterinary medicine health alert yesterday.

45:42.480 --> 45:43.840
Emaxadyne...

45:43.840 --> 45:47.960
..were tainted and a complete recall of the brand is underway.

45:47.960 --> 45:51.040
We ask you to register pet details and the type of procedure

45:51.040 --> 45:52.680
on the attached form

45:52.680 --> 45:56.160
and return it to us so that we can lodge it with the company.

45:56.160 --> 45:57.360
Let me just...

45:59.560 --> 46:01.760
In case he does a bit of research of his own.

46:01.760 --> 46:04.720
Oh, brilliant. Is the Trojan ready?

46:06.520 --> 46:07.640
Yep.

46:09.760 --> 46:11.600
OK. Let's hope he bites.

46:23.360 --> 46:25.360
Come on. Come on.

46:26.320 --> 46:28.200
How long do we have, once he clicks?

46:28.200 --> 46:31.440
You'll two minutes to get the keys before the walls start falling in.

46:36.720 --> 46:38.560
Come on.

46:40.040 --> 46:41.080
Come on!

46:44.440 --> 46:46.440
Yes! Ah!

47:00.920 --> 47:03.280
- Security's good. 
- Yep.

47:07.200 --> 47:09.280
- Everything good on your side? 
- Yeah.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.680
- Jan, you noticing that? 
- Yeah, I got it covered.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.400
They must have an anomalous pattern detection. We gotta go.

47:28.400 --> 47:31.160
- One more minute. 
- We don't have a minute.

47:31.160 --> 47:32.680
Come on. Come on, Jesse.

47:34.040 --> 47:35.400
Come on!

47:36.360 --> 47:38.960
Fuck it. We gotta go. Come on, Jesse!

47:49.120 --> 47:50.960
HE CHUCKLES

48:08.400 --> 48:11.920
PHONE RINGS

48:37.920 --> 48:40.960
I ordered for you. Thought we don't have loads of time to waste.

48:45.280 --> 48:48.280
Um, so what's on your mind, Lara?

48:48.280 --> 48:49.520
SHE LAUGHS

48:49.520 --> 48:52.200
Well, too much, probably.

48:52.200 --> 48:55.280
But I needed to see you in person because there's talk this morning

48:55.280 --> 48:57.360
about some pictures you got yesterday.

48:57.360 --> 49:00.000
I haven't actually seen them but let's just say

49:00.000 --> 49:03.440
there's some pretty heavy pressure not to go down that road.

49:07.440 --> 49:09.080
CLEARS THROAT

49:10.560 --> 49:13.920
Don't get me wrong, Lara. You're one of the smartest people I know.

49:13.920 --> 49:17.120
But I don't remember appointing you to my advisory team.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.960
SHE CHUCKLES

49:18.960 --> 49:20.680
You're right.

49:20.680 --> 49:25.280
But I crossed over that line because I care.

49:26.240 --> 49:27.720
- WOMAN: 
- There you go.

49:27.720 --> 49:29.120
- Thank you so much. 
- You're welcome.

49:30.560 --> 49:33.320
I heard Alyse got a scholarship. That's fantastic news.

49:33.320 --> 49:34.960
She must be thrilled!

49:34.960 --> 49:36.680
Mm!

49:36.680 --> 49:39.360
I'm ravenous. Eat!

49:45.960 --> 49:51.640
WOMAN SINGING

50:20.000 --> 50:22.280
ALL CHANT

50:27.000 --> 50:28.800
- Free! 
- Remsey!

50:28.800 --> 50:30.280
- Free! 
- Remsey!

50:30.280 --> 50:33.440
CROWD CONTINUES CHANTING

50:35.520 --> 50:36.840
HORN TOOTS

50:36.840 --> 50:39.920
HORN BLARES

50:39.920 --> 50:40.960
Trouble.

50:51.680 --> 50:52.960
HORN BEEPS

50:52.960 --> 50:55.800
- GUARD: 
- We got a convoy of trucks heading up to the mine.

50:55.800 --> 50:59.720
There's a protest blocking the road. We need them moved.

51:00.800 --> 51:03.240
HORN BLARES

51:08.440 --> 51:10.800
HORN TOOTS

51:12.360 --> 51:14.520
That would've taken me,

51:14.520 --> 51:18.440
if I'd worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week,

51:18.440 --> 51:21.760
about 300 years to crack.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.920
MESSAGE ALERT

51:34.920 --> 51:36.880
Don't open anything till I get back.

52:31.560 --> 52:32.760
Thanks.

52:39.200 --> 52:41.000
They got the Kaspion Keys.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.760
What's Kaspion?

52:47.040 --> 52:48.840
It's a crawler programme.

52:50.520 --> 52:52.040
They release it across a network

52:52.040 --> 52:54.360
and it red-flags every machine that's got a backdoor.

52:54.360 --> 52:56.440
You know which systems have vulnerabilities,

52:56.440 --> 52:58.200
you can let yourself in any time you want.

52:58.200 --> 53:01.280
What kind of systems are we talking about?

53:01.280 --> 53:04.640
Financial institutions, power grids, weaponry, hospitals.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.920
It's not fussy.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.320
It's just looking for the chips

53:11.320 --> 53:13.640
which have had the flaws manufactured into them.

53:13.640 --> 53:15.840
Manufactured in by who?

53:15.840 --> 53:18.960
Who has the biggest budget for cyber operations on the planet?

53:35.680 --> 53:38.640
CROWD CHANTS

54:34.160 --> 54:36.280
SCREAMING

54:56.160 --> 54:58.960
- Oh! 
- GASPS

55:15.360 --> 55:17.840
SOUND FADES

55:35.680 --> 55:39.040
LARA: There was a point where being silent was protecting him

55:39.040 --> 55:43.440
but now...it's about saving him from himself.

55:55.440 --> 55:59.760
SCREAMS AND YELLING

56:02.800 --> 56:04.600
Kiki!

56:05.560 --> 56:06.600
