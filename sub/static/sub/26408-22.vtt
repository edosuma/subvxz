WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:03.916
Previously onSEAL Team...
 We've lost Bravo 2.

00:03.960 --> 00:06.267
I say again, we've lost Bravo 2.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.746
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.333
Do you copy?
All right, change of plans.

00:09.357 --> 00:11.359
We're going to get Ray.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.448
I came here to talk
about my real issue TBI.

00:13.491 --> 00:15.339
I didn't see any record
of traumatic brain injury.

00:15.363 --> 00:16.929
If your wound wasn't documented

00:16.973 --> 00:18.844
while you were serving,
I can't treat it.

00:19.932 --> 00:21.238
Hey, Swanny.

00:27.375 --> 00:30.334
ISR just picked up
Bravo 2's helmet strobe. Copy that.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.249
They'll send everyone.
Bravo will not be able

00:32.293 --> 00:33.555
to fight their way to safety.

00:33.598 --> 00:34.947
I know.

00:34.991 --> 00:37.385
There's no chance I'm
authorizing an Indian-led QRF.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.015
And you'll have to deal
with the fallout.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.824
Bashir Varma. I
know this location.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.397
I will kill you.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.312
Ain't nothing stopping me.

00:54.097 --> 00:55.968
Go.

01:01.452 --> 01:02.845
He is my refuge,

01:02.888 --> 01:04.281
my God in whom I trust.

01:04.325 --> 01:06.762
Ray, get down.

01:16.163 --> 01:17.642
Copy that.

01:17.686 --> 01:19.209
Bravo's helo is about
to touch down.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.318
Can't believe we're getting
them all back in one piece.

01:21.342 --> 01:24.214
Well, recovered Ray,
avoided a diplomatic firestorm,

01:24.258 --> 01:26.434
and we didn't escalate
the India-Pakistan crisis

01:26.477 --> 01:28.479
into a nuclear war.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.133
I'd call today a win.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.135
Well, don't forget
why we're here, Commander.

01:32.179 --> 01:33.658
To get Yasin Khan.

01:33.702 --> 01:35.312
Let me remind you,

01:35.356 --> 01:37.140
recovering Perry rather than

01:37.184 --> 01:38.750
taking out Khan was your call.

01:38.794 --> 01:41.536
One that's had
some serious consequences.

01:41.579 --> 01:44.104
Rescuing Senior Chief Perry
was the right decision.

01:44.147 --> 01:45.757
I stand by it, sir.

01:46.976 --> 01:49.109
A zealot like Khan, he's
got to spread his message.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.458
He's not gonna go underground.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.068
We'll find him.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.852
It won't be Bravo
going in if you do.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.419
Had your shot and you missed.

01:55.463 --> 01:56.681
Total mission failure.

01:56.725 --> 01:58.944
That's not entirely
fair, sir, we...

01:58.988 --> 02:00.337
I don't entirely care.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.557
The results speak
for themselves.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.602
A word, Commander?

02:13.089 --> 02:14.569
Hey, Ray. How you feeling? Hey.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.573
A few scratches,
few bruises, but...

02:18.616 --> 02:20.749
I'll be ready to go
when we reload on Khan.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.230
Not asking about the elbow.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.014
I know.

02:27.016 --> 02:29.453
Give us a minute, will you?

02:34.328 --> 02:36.460
How am I feeling? Yeah.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.767
How are you feeling?

02:38.810 --> 02:40.812
Feel like I've never seen
a more beautiful sunset

02:40.856 --> 02:42.423
than the one I saw tonight.

02:44.425 --> 02:45.600
Feel like...

02:45.643 --> 02:47.428
I've never wanted to
see my family more

02:47.471 --> 02:48.951
than I want to see
them right now.

02:50.692 --> 02:53.216
And I feel like...

02:53.260 --> 02:55.218
I don't deserve...

02:55.262 --> 02:56.872
my teammates who marched
through hell

02:56.915 --> 02:58.613
to come save me.

02:58.656 --> 03:01.181
Really thought you were
gonna die on that mountain.

03:02.312 --> 03:03.661
I did die.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.665
Part of me, anyway.

03:07.709 --> 03:10.320
I was almost lost
for good, brother.

03:13.802 --> 03:16.108
Told this woman
I was holed up with...

03:16.152 --> 03:18.372
I'd kill her
if she made a sound.

03:19.590 --> 03:22.332
I scared her, but
I terrified myself.

03:22.376 --> 03:25.030
Mostly because
I believed I'd do it.

03:25.074 --> 03:27.511
Knew I was digging my own grave

03:27.555 --> 03:29.557
if I let her go, but, Jace,

03:29.600 --> 03:31.994
something happened
and I realized

03:32.037 --> 03:33.952
she was sent to me.

03:33.996 --> 03:36.564
That woman was my salvation.

03:36.607 --> 03:39.349
She was your salvation...
How's that?

03:39.393 --> 03:40.698
It just hit me.

03:40.742 --> 03:44.311
I'd rather die being
the man Naima loved...

03:44.354 --> 03:46.530
than live as the man she found.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.795
I know Mexico...

03:50.839 --> 03:54.146
denying that guy's
last rites, it...

03:54.190 --> 03:55.626
hey.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.759
That wasn't you, man,
that was me.

03:57.802 --> 04:00.544
I know how hard
that was on you, and I...

04:00.588 --> 04:02.503
should have been there
for you, and I wasn't.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.940
You were when you marched
your ass

04:04.983 --> 04:06.724
over that damn mountain
to come save me.

04:06.768 --> 04:09.945
And that's all that matters.

04:10.989 --> 04:13.905
No brother left behind.Amen.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.517
Amen. That's right.

04:28.398 --> 04:30.313
Back in five,

04:30.357 --> 04:32.707
four, three...

04:33.534 --> 04:35.840
I'm pleased to be joined
by Ash Spenser,

04:35.884 --> 04:38.321
former Navy SEAL and author
of the best-selling book.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.931
The Man behind the Myth.

04:39.975 --> 04:42.978
Welcome. It's an absolute honor
to be here, Patty,

04:43.021 --> 04:44.981
speaking about an American hero
that your audience

04:45.023 --> 04:46.851
most likely has never heard of.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.375
Brett Swann.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.681
Brett is the former Navy SEAL
who recently

04:50.725 --> 04:52.161
took his own life
in the parking lot

04:52.204 --> 04:54.206
of a VA campus? That's correct.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.557
One among 19 veterans
who have committed suicide

04:56.600 --> 04:59.864
on VA campuses
from 2017 till now.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.605
What do you call that?

05:01.649 --> 05:03.085
Acts of protest.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.608
Wake-up calls.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.828
Right, I-I guess what
I'm asking, Ash, is,

05:06.871 --> 05:08.830
did Brett do
what he did because he was

05:08.873 --> 05:10.658
suffering from
traumatic brain injury?

05:11.833 --> 05:13.356
Brett committed suicide because

05:13.400 --> 05:15.532
he couldn't get treatment
for his TBI.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.229
And that's a crime.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.840
A national disgrace.

05:20.885 --> 05:22.670
Is this your second book?

05:22.713 --> 05:24.193
That's correct.

05:24.236 --> 05:25.629
There he is,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.979
Bravo 2 is back in the fold.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.720
Hey, how you feeling, buddy?

05:31.766 --> 05:33.202
I...

05:33.245 --> 05:35.073
grateful for all
you boys did for me.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.293
Hate I put you in that position.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.686
Do it again if we have to.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.122
Well, no doubt, but,

05:40.165 --> 05:42.429
if you do go missing again,
can we please

05:42.472 --> 05:44.518
do it in a less
vertical environment?

05:44.561 --> 05:46.365
Because my legs, they,
they are killing me right now.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.260
Hurt? Like that? That hurt?

05:48.304 --> 05:49.871
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, now.

05:49.914 --> 05:51.612
Thank God for those horses.

05:51.655 --> 05:52.893
You know,
I'm actually pissed off

05:52.917 --> 05:54.068
that I missed Sonny
in his element.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.442
In his element, man? Yeah.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.071
He's definitely
no Clint Eastwood on a horse.

05:57.095 --> 05:58.706
More like a koala bear
on a mule.

05:58.749 --> 06:01.317
What the hell
you talking about, man?

06:01.361 --> 06:03.624
I was doing things
on that animal

06:03.667 --> 06:05.582
that you city boys
can't even comprehend.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.323
Sonny can't ride.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.585
- No, he can't ride.
- What?

06:08.629 --> 06:10.413
I can ride just fine, I just...

06:10.457 --> 06:12.589
I'm not a fan of those
furry, demonic quadrupeds.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.375
A cowboy that hates horses.
I don't get it, I don't get it.

06:15.418 --> 06:16.680
A frogman who hates water.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.397
You two are a hell of a lot
more entertaining

06:18.421 --> 06:19.659
when you
punch each other. I mean, look,

06:19.683 --> 06:21.163
hey, you could've...
been Full Metal.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.034
He fell off at least,
what, twice?

06:23.078 --> 06:24.645
What I was demonstrating there

06:24.688 --> 06:26.516
was a classic
horse warfare combat dismount.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.431
Y'all should've been
taking notes.

06:28.475 --> 06:29.737
All right, here we go.

06:29.780 --> 06:32.174
So, we cleared hot
to go get Khan?

06:32.217 --> 06:33.436
Khan's in the wind.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.699
Entire compound's been vacated.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.180
Look, fellas,

06:38.223 --> 06:41.357
Commander Shaw's gonna recommend
that Bravo Team be split up

06:41.401 --> 06:43.620
when we get back
from Virginia Beach.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.753
I'm sorry.

06:45.796 --> 06:48.582
I wanted you to hear
it from me first.

06:49.887 --> 06:52.803
Guy's got no right.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.719
I wouldn't trade Shaw's position

06:55.763 --> 06:57.678
for all the tri-tip
in the world.

07:35.977 --> 07:38.370
Shaw's out of his mind.

07:39.415 --> 07:41.286
I'll do whatever I can.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.854
Exhaust my Rolodex.
People owe me favors.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.092
You know what,
maybe you should spend

07:45.116 --> 07:47.292
some more time
watching your own six.

07:47.336 --> 07:49.120
Indian helo disappears
out of nowhere.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.558
You must have pulled
some strings for that one.

07:51.601 --> 07:54.169
Some strings, something
like that, yeah,

07:54.212 --> 07:56.606
That's gonna cost you.

07:58.216 --> 08:01.524
A lot of things we do
in this job keep me up at night,

08:01.568 --> 08:05.615
but risking it to save you guys
is not gonna be one of them.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.792
Are you gonna be okay?

08:08.836 --> 08:10.620
Okay? I just blew up my team.

08:10.664 --> 08:12.796
You saved Ray's life.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.625
Yeah, right after I almost
ruined my relationship with him.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.848
You know, Mandy, I just
spent months convincing myself

08:20.891 --> 08:23.459
that everything is just fine,
that everything's okay,

08:23.503 --> 08:25.853
despite everything that's
gone on in my life.

08:25.896 --> 08:28.072
My wife dying.

08:28.682 --> 08:31.641
Adam getting blown up.

08:31.685 --> 08:34.164
Brett, Clay.

08:35.905 --> 08:37.928
You know, Mandy, maybe it's
just me who's falling apart

08:37.952 --> 08:39.519
and taking my team with me.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.695
You're being too hard on yourself.
Am I?

08:41.738 --> 08:43.392
Am I?

08:48.397 --> 08:51.487
I have never seen anyone
adapt so effortlessly

08:51.531 --> 08:53.489
on the battlefield.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.447
You can do that
off the field, too.

08:55.491 --> 08:56.797
You just have to decide to.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.234
I don't know.

08:59.277 --> 09:01.584
I don't know how.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.417
Where you going?

09:10.375 --> 09:11.725
Find Khan.

09:11.768 --> 09:14.249
Hung around you long enough
to know one thing.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.381
What's that?

09:16.425 --> 09:18.558
We're never out of the fight.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.477
Patty. Such a pleasure.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.001
Nice to see you again.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.614
So, what'd you think?

09:31.658 --> 09:34.530
I think Swanny couldn't ask
for a better advocate.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.923
Take a real coldhearted bastard

09:35.966 --> 09:37.577
not to give him a
Purple Heart now.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.230
Thanks for stepping up.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.406
One second.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.235
Spenser here.

09:44.279 --> 09:47.195
Congressman Zuckerman.

09:47.238 --> 09:49.719
You saw it?

09:49.763 --> 09:52.592
Yes, sir, it's...
hugely important.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.552
No, I-I can do that.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.076
Absolutely. I'll
see you tomorrow.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.403
Congressman Zuckerman
from the Armed Forces Committee?

10:02.427 --> 10:04.429
This guy draws a
lot of water, Clay.

10:04.473 --> 10:06.170
Could be just the guy we need

10:06.214 --> 10:08.390
to fast-track that
Purple Heart for Brett.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.697
All because of you, kid.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.328
It's hard to believe
we might never go

10:14.352 --> 10:16.093
outside the wire together again.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.966
Shaw's got his head so far
up his cake-eating ass.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.795
Hate to see what the world's
like without Bravo in it.

10:27.670 --> 10:31.108
Indian intel source
places Khan in Lahore tonight

10:31.152 --> 10:32.501
for a high-level meeting.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.459
I hate to be a buzzkill,
Mandy, but...

10:34.503 --> 10:38.202
Shaw grounded us. Indians can't escalate
their standoff with Pakistan.

10:38.246 --> 10:40.050
We're the closest American unit
in the theater.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.858
This call will be
above Shaw's head.

10:41.902 --> 10:45.340
One last rodeo.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.124
Bravo rides again.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.697
India intelligence
received confirmation

10:54.741 --> 10:58.135
Khan
stayed local, and is holding

10:58.179 --> 11:00.790
a meeting tonight to coordinate
a multipronged attack,

11:00.834 --> 11:04.011
likely in retaliation
for being targeted.

11:04.054 --> 11:07.275
Gentlemen, this continues to be
an extremely volatile situation.

11:07.318 --> 11:10.713
The entire region is on high
alert, both sides of the border.

11:10.757 --> 11:14.369
And an urban environment means
even less of a margin of error.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.414
This needs to be
a flawless operation.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.634
The target building sits
in the middle of the city,

11:18.678 --> 11:20.636
Populated area

11:20.680 --> 11:22.159
means lots of eyes and ears.

11:22.203 --> 11:24.118
Attracting
any unwanted attention

11:24.161 --> 11:26.381
will send this op sideways
in a hurry.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.470
Zero footprint on this one.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.472
All right, now that
everybody's ears are up,

11:30.515 --> 11:33.301
it's gonna be tough sneaking
into Pakistan under their noses.

11:33.344 --> 11:36.347
Yeah. An industrial
zone is fed by a river

11:36.391 --> 11:38.393
that runs into Lahore
from India.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.525
We'll swim in? Yeah, swim.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.527
Khan is a treasure trove
of intelligence.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.418
This could be the most
significant capture since KSM.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.401
Capture?

11:48.446 --> 11:49.772
We're toe-tagging
that son of a bitch

11:49.796 --> 11:51.449
for what he did to Bravo 6.

11:51.493 --> 11:55.671
Listen, I know you all
want justice for Clay,

11:55.715 --> 11:58.195
but Bravo could win
a lot of friends

11:58.239 --> 12:02.983
at the Pentagon and at Langley
if you bring Khan in alive.

12:16.474 --> 12:19.564
Saw your dad on TV last night.

12:19.608 --> 12:22.742
What's
he grandstanding about now?

12:22.785 --> 12:24.569
Brett Swann.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.050
That right?

12:27.094 --> 12:29.357
Yes, that is right.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.533
It's ironic how your father
picked up the very fight

12:31.576 --> 12:33.317
that I ordered you to put down.

12:34.579 --> 12:35.972
Yes, sir.

12:39.628 --> 12:43.110
Good frogman uses every tool
in their kit to succeed.

12:43.153 --> 12:46.722
I hope Ash gets Swanny
what he deserves.

13:07.699 --> 13:10.180
Contact's here.

13:10.224 --> 13:13.096
Gear up.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.451
Painter's van.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.410
Nice touch, Batra.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.542
So, doing some
interior decorating

13:24.586 --> 13:26.240
or are we gonna be
schwacking boogers?

13:26.283 --> 13:29.504
You guys are as good as I hear,
there will be time for both.

13:29.547 --> 13:32.463
Havoc, this is 1,
I'm passing Dirty Work.

13:39.688 --> 13:40.994
Cordoned off
the target building.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.909
Well, what do you call
a curveball in cricket?

13:42.952 --> 13:45.520
Cops must be on the take.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.652
Yeah, we make our move now,
we'll be front-page news.

13:47.696 --> 13:50.786
Hey, circle back to the alley
behind the building.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.506
Bravo 1, the side alley has
approximately two meters

13:55.530 --> 13:57.488
of separation
between the buildings.

13:57.532 --> 13:59.403
Copy that, Havoc.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.365
Target building
doesn't have a back door.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.714
Yeah, but it's got
a fire escape.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.455
Sonny, take care
of those lights.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.370
Roger that, Master Chief.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.640
Take the fire escape
up to the roof,

14:18.683 --> 14:20.424
clear down, exfil the same way.

14:20.468 --> 14:21.817
All right.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.188
Full Metal,
you've got overwatch.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.711
Roger that. Havoc, this is 1.

15:29.754 --> 15:30.930
Passing Undercover.

15:56.129 --> 15:59.436
Bravo 1, we have two tangos
in the clear.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.135
Copy, 7. Keep an eye on 'em.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.456
Sixth floor clear.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.622
Go.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.363
Stairs.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.683
Slow, slow.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.801
Moving!

17:43.845 --> 17:45.064
Khan's going for the police.

17:48.241 --> 17:51.374
SSE, get a biometric to collect
all intel and cell phones.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.420
Roger that.

18:00.731 --> 18:03.212
I'll go around. I'll take the stairs,
cut 'em off.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.137
We got squares
in the fire escape.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.100
Bravo 3, this is 7.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.754
White side clear.

18:35.462 --> 18:36.898
Call us even?

18:36.941 --> 18:38.204
Cuff him, will you?

18:38.247 --> 18:40.771
Yeah.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.860
I got him. Yeah. Got him?

18:44.558 --> 18:46.386
Compliments of Clay Spenser.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.877
SSE's complete. Get those images to Havoc.
All right, let's go.

18:59.921 --> 19:01.879
Safe in, safe out. Collapse
the way we came in.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.490
Bravo 7, moving to you.

19:53.801 --> 19:54.801
Jackpot.

20:00.677 --> 20:01.896
Commander Shaw,

20:01.939 --> 20:05.029
we just confirmed
that Bravo killed four

20:05.073 --> 20:07.510
of the most wanted terrorists
in the region tonight.

20:07.554 --> 20:11.122
Tell you what, Shaw's got some
pair, hitching a ride with us.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.255
We should give
Commander Yoko Nono

20:13.299 --> 20:15.301
the Argentinian
elevator treatment.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.744
I tell you what, Shaw's gonna
be headed for a long-neck enema

20:17.781 --> 20:19.522
if he tries
to turn this plane dry.

20:19.566 --> 20:21.500
Yeah, well, I don't think
he's gonna be interested

20:21.524 --> 20:22.830
in tangling with you.

20:22.873 --> 20:25.049
Shaw just got his legs
cut out from under him.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.810
You want to tell me what in
the hell you're talking about?

20:26.834 --> 20:28.749
What I'm saying is,
is that in addition

20:28.792 --> 20:32.883
to capturing Khan,
you boys just took out

20:32.927 --> 20:35.712
four of the most wanted
terrorists in the region.

20:35.756 --> 20:38.324
Shaw is gonna
get laughed out of D.C.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.195
if he tries to take out Bravo.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.762
Looks like
the band ain't breaking up

20:41.805 --> 20:43.633
any time soon,
'cause we're back.

20:43.677 --> 20:46.854
Look, we've taken our share
of lumps this deployment.

20:46.897 --> 20:48.769
Some of 'em were
self-inflicted, but...

20:48.812 --> 20:51.641
you guys kept pulling
yourselves up off the mat.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.643
In the end...

20:53.687 --> 20:56.646
we took out the son of a
bitch who took out Clay.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.300
Never out of the fight.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.694
Never out of the fight.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.957
Cheers to that. Cheers, bud.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.002
Cheers.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.314
Hey.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.316
How'd it go
with the congressman?

21:14.360 --> 21:15.839
That man can talk.

21:15.883 --> 21:18.799
Can I get a whiskey on the
rocks, make it a double?

21:18.842 --> 21:20.627
Isn't it a little early
for a double?

21:20.670 --> 21:24.195
Politicians will do that to you.

21:24.239 --> 21:26.285
So? What, is he,
is he gonna push

21:26.328 --> 21:28.243
for the Purple Heart for Brett?

21:28.287 --> 21:30.680
Congressman Zuckerman
definitely views Brett's case

21:30.724 --> 21:33.117
as an opportunity to spread
the word about the need

21:33.161 --> 21:36.860
to change the way that we treat
our vets, but... thank you...

21:36.904 --> 21:39.472
The only change that clown
is really interested in

21:39.515 --> 21:41.778
is moving his ass to the Senate.

21:43.563 --> 21:46.696
Yeah, well, doing
what's right and self-promotion

21:46.740 --> 21:48.437
aren't mutually exclusive.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.831
Zuckerman made it
clear if the military

21:50.874 --> 21:53.268
were to start retroactively
awarding Purple Hearts,

21:53.312 --> 21:55.672
it'll just open up all kinds
of floodgates for legal issues,

21:55.705 --> 21:58.578
creating huge financial burdens.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.668
Brett's not getting
a Purple Heart.

22:01.711 --> 22:04.192
No, he's not,

22:04.235 --> 22:06.107
but I'm gonna keep
banging on the drum.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.805
Maybe it's time to let it go.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.720
I'm not letting it go.

22:10.764 --> 22:12.548
In a few years
you're gonna be a vet.

22:12.592 --> 22:15.725
I'm not gonna let you
suffer the same fate.

22:15.769 --> 22:18.728
And, look, I want
this for Swann.

22:18.772 --> 22:22.384
I want this for all the vets.

22:22.428 --> 22:23.951
But mostly I want it for you.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.043
Thanks, Dad.

22:31.611 --> 22:34.396
All right, let's go, boys.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.138
Wheels up America in 15 minutes.

22:37.181 --> 22:38.574
Relax, Sonny.

22:38.618 --> 22:40.160
Freedom bird ain't going
nowhere without us.

22:40.184 --> 22:42.839
Yeah, and technically we're
in America right now, dumbass.

22:42.883 --> 22:44.624
Just go back to
not talking, Brock.

22:50.064 --> 22:52.066
Man, look at you.

22:52.109 --> 22:54.416
I ain't seen you grinning
like that for months, Ray.

22:54.460 --> 22:58.638
Man, that's my "18 hours
from kissing my babies" grin.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.161
Yeah.

23:00.204 --> 23:02.816
Must be nice to have
somebody to come home to.

23:02.859 --> 23:05.122
Yeah, just hope I get
a warm welcome.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.950
You weren't exactly

23:06.994 --> 23:09.257
husband of the year in this
deployment, but then again,

23:09.300 --> 23:12.652
you didn't cross any lines
of fatal variety.

23:12.695 --> 23:15.306
Naima will have your back,
like she always does.

23:15.350 --> 23:16.525
Hope so.

23:17.961 --> 23:19.920
Ha.

23:19.963 --> 23:21.487
Look at you.

23:21.530 --> 23:24.925
Usually I got to drag
Sonny out of the sandbox.

23:24.968 --> 23:27.754
Aw, come on, I-I just want
to get back and see Clay

23:27.797 --> 23:29.277
and reunite the team.

23:29.320 --> 23:32.498
Sonny's got deployment fever.
What's her name?

23:32.541 --> 23:33.562
Yeah, and not her dancer name.

23:33.586 --> 23:34.586
Yeah.

23:36.023 --> 23:37.546
Man, I just want to get

23:37.590 --> 23:40.114
the hell off this cursed island.
Let's go, boys.

24:07.924 --> 24:09.622
Hey.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.711
No, I'm good.

24:18.065 --> 24:19.806
Damn, you look so grown up.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.808
Don't remind my dad.

24:21.851 --> 24:25.028
What's going on, buddy?
How's it going, dude?

24:25.072 --> 24:26.726
I'm good. Yeah?

24:26.769 --> 24:28.118
How's your leg? It's good.

24:28.162 --> 24:29.468
Yeah, it's gonna be fine.

24:34.037 --> 24:36.692
Look at you.!

24:41.784 --> 24:42.785
Ray.

24:44.918 --> 24:45.658
Where's Naima?

24:45.701 --> 24:47.747
I...

24:47.790 --> 24:49.618
I didn't tell her
I was coming home today.

24:49.662 --> 24:52.055
I need to go to her.

24:52.099 --> 24:53.317
I owe her that much.

24:53.361 --> 24:54.841
It's gonna be good.

24:54.884 --> 24:56.930
Hope so. Look at you, cowboy.

24:56.973 --> 24:59.106
What's going on? Yeah.

24:59.149 --> 25:01.761
We got that guy that
de-Playgirled your leg.

25:01.804 --> 25:03.545
That doesn't surprise me.Yeah.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.025
Alive.

25:05.068 --> 25:07.549
Now, that surprises me.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.029
Sonny Quinn.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.552
Look at you,

25:10.596 --> 25:12.946
looking pretty damn good
for a cake-eater.

25:12.989 --> 25:15.644
Well, thank you, I think. Yeah?

25:15.688 --> 25:17.733
What's the plan for tonight?

25:17.777 --> 25:20.344
Think we're all
gonna go out drinking.-

25:20.388 --> 25:22.042
No. Before then.

25:22.085 --> 25:26.002
I think we should find
the nearest bedroom ASAP.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.136
Hey, Sunshine. Look at you.

25:29.179 --> 25:31.051
Hi.Hey.

25:31.094 --> 25:32.879
What's going on?

25:32.922 --> 25:35.098
Good? Yeah, good.

25:51.854 --> 25:53.856
That you, Ray?

25:53.900 --> 25:55.858
Yeah, baby, it's me,

25:55.902 --> 25:57.599
the man you married.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.949
Welcome home.

26:15.617 --> 26:18.141
Hey.

26:19.621 --> 26:22.276
Hey.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.931
Remember how Mikey hated
being away from home?

26:24.974 --> 26:28.804
All he does now is talk
about how great Bridon is.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.806
Yeah.

26:30.850 --> 26:33.504
His coach called me.

26:33.548 --> 26:35.376
They want him to,

26:35.419 --> 26:37.160
stay the summer and train there.

26:37.204 --> 26:38.466
What?

26:38.509 --> 26:39.859
You'd let him stay?

26:39.902 --> 26:41.904
Look how happy he is.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.038
I just want him to be happy.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.692
It's too expensive.

26:46.735 --> 26:49.129
You can't afford it. Got it figured out.

26:49.172 --> 26:51.348
But you'll be alone.

26:53.524 --> 26:57.485
Yeah. Maybe sooner
than I'd like.

26:57.528 --> 26:59.182
What?

26:59.226 --> 27:02.185
Been looking
into Tisch's summer program.

27:02.229 --> 27:06.320
And it's a great opportunity
to work with incoming freshmen

27:06.363 --> 27:08.322
and work with, visiting faculty.

27:08.365 --> 27:10.411
You sound like a brochure.

27:10.454 --> 27:11.804
What?

27:11.847 --> 27:15.155
Saw it on the website, and...

27:15.198 --> 27:17.026
And I think
it'd be good for you.

27:17.070 --> 27:18.767
I don't understand.

27:18.811 --> 27:21.770
You've been fighting me going
to college this whole time.

27:21.814 --> 27:24.381
Emma, you know, my job is
to protect people.

27:24.425 --> 27:25.687
It's what I do.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.950
And with you, you know,
going off to college,

27:27.994 --> 27:29.430
being so far away, I'm thinking,

27:29.473 --> 27:31.301
how am I supposed
to protect you?

27:31.345 --> 27:32.999
Protect me from what? Don't know.

27:33.042 --> 27:36.176
Bad choices, bad people,
things happening,

27:36.219 --> 27:39.179
you getting hurt,
but that's not rational.

27:39.222 --> 27:41.181
It's not rational.

27:41.224 --> 27:44.445
You know, that kind of fear
just eats you up inside,

27:44.488 --> 27:48.710
and it's undermining,
and I don't want my fear to ruin

27:48.754 --> 27:51.626
your future.

27:51.670 --> 27:55.021
You just woke up one day in Guam
and figured that all out?

27:55.064 --> 27:59.242
I just woke up and I decided
to work the problem, and I'm...

28:01.549 --> 28:03.551
I'm gonna work the problem.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.696
British intelligence
received these a day ago.

28:19.741 --> 28:22.570
The man with the hole
in his face is Bashir Varma.

28:22.613 --> 28:24.093
A terrorist.

28:24.137 --> 28:26.095
A dead terrorist.

28:26.139 --> 28:28.358
And now a dead CIA asset.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.366
Chatter confirms
that the Indians killed him,

28:36.410 --> 28:39.456
and the only reason
they knew where Bashir was

28:39.500 --> 28:40.980
You.

28:43.156 --> 28:45.332
You unilaterally decided
to burn an asset.

28:45.375 --> 28:46.768
I made a decision

28:46.812 --> 28:49.815
to ensure the survival
of a Tier One asset

28:49.858 --> 28:51.991
and an entire SEAL team.

28:52.034 --> 28:54.254
You went rogue.

28:58.301 --> 29:00.782
I'm pulling you out of DEVGRU,
out of the field.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.829
And for the rest of your career,
you will only see the world

29:03.872 --> 29:07.093
through the worst D.C. office
window that I can locate.

29:37.558 --> 29:41.127
Left. Left. Left. Right.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.912
Left. Left. Left.

29:43.956 --> 29:46.610
Left. Right. Left.

29:46.654 --> 29:48.177
Left.

29:48.221 --> 29:50.658
Left. Left. Right. Left.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.051
Left.

29:52.094 --> 29:57.099
Left. A-left.
Right. Left. Left...

29:57.143 --> 29:59.362
"In my Father's house
are many mansions.

29:59.406 --> 30:01.756
"If it were not so,
I would have told you.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.716
"I go to prepare a place
for you.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.328
"And if I go
and prepare a place for you,

30:08.371 --> 30:12.419
"I will come again
and receive you unto myself;

30:12.462 --> 30:14.421
"That where I am,

30:14.464 --> 30:16.466
there ye may be also."

30:37.661 --> 30:42.536
What can I say about Brett Swann
that we don't already know?

30:42.579 --> 30:45.539
Brett was...
he was a great man. Check.

30:45.582 --> 30:48.977
To me this moment
isn't about Brett.

30:49.021 --> 30:51.762
It's about failure.

30:51.806 --> 30:54.809
Brett took his own life.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.813
That's not why his life is over.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.947
He was found in a parking lot,
but he didn't die there.

31:03.557 --> 31:07.735
He died in Afghanistan
with his best friend Nicky.

31:07.778 --> 31:12.305
Every moment that Brett
was living past that contact,

31:12.348 --> 31:16.048
he was only sleepwalking,

31:16.091 --> 31:18.659
because he was hurt
and he was changed.

31:18.702 --> 31:23.707
I know because I was there for
the last few months of his life.

31:23.751 --> 31:27.668
He was... he was helping me,
and he did help me.

31:29.278 --> 31:31.715
Brett Swann was a hero.

31:33.717 --> 31:36.807
Injured in combat,
killed by war.

31:36.851 --> 31:39.332
And he deserved
to be honored as such.

31:39.375 --> 31:42.726
And that didn't happen because
I failed to make it happen.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.599
So...

31:45.642 --> 31:48.384
I'm going to...
I'm gonna leave it up

31:48.428 --> 31:50.082
to some other people
to talk about

31:50.125 --> 31:52.214
what kind of a man Brett was.

31:54.173 --> 31:56.523
What I'd like to do
is apologize.

32:01.006 --> 32:03.399
I'm sorry
our country failed you, Brett.

32:05.706 --> 32:08.535
I'm sorry
that our politicians failed you.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.540
I'm sorry
that the VA failed you.

32:21.548 --> 32:24.203
Most of all,
I'm sorry that I failed you.

32:26.770 --> 32:30.383
I failed to get for you an honor
which is rightfully yours.

32:30.426 --> 32:32.385
You deserved better than me.

32:32.428 --> 32:36.041
Than us as a nation.

32:37.781 --> 32:40.045
Every vet deserves better
than what they got.

32:43.874 --> 32:46.007
That's it.

34:25.324 --> 34:27.935
Thanks for letting me
invade your life.

34:27.978 --> 34:29.676
Sure.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.678
I mean, not that I had a right.

34:31.721 --> 34:34.202
No, friends have the right.

34:37.684 --> 34:39.902
Watching you deal
with everything

34:39.947 --> 34:43.168
the last couple weeks
reminded me of, um...

34:43.210 --> 34:44.734
why you stood out.

34:44.777 --> 34:47.911
You know, at the bar,
the night we met.

34:50.784 --> 34:53.178
I don't really feel much like
the man I was when we met.

34:53.221 --> 34:54.788
That's 'cause you're not.

34:54.831 --> 34:58.487
You're an even better man.

35:02.012 --> 35:04.450
All right, I... I got to be
serious for a second.

35:04.493 --> 35:07.670
I doubt that.

35:07.714 --> 35:10.847
I am. Look it,
this is my serious face.Okay.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.588
Yeah. Sonny Quinn serious.Okay.

35:12.632 --> 35:16.636
You, find out
about officer billet?

35:16.679 --> 35:20.422
San Diego.

35:20.466 --> 35:22.207
That's where they want me.Ouch.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.514
Me, I just can't get my head
wrapped around, you know,

35:25.558 --> 35:27.081
missing Davis.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.517
Same, Sonny.

35:28.561 --> 35:31.303
When?

35:31.346 --> 35:32.782
Six weeks.

35:32.826 --> 35:36.003
Okay. Okay.

35:36.046 --> 35:38.266
Sonny, let's make
the time count.

35:38.310 --> 35:40.486
Yeah. Yeah?

35:40.529 --> 35:41.791
Yes, ma'am.

35:44.185 --> 35:45.926
So how did everything go?

35:45.969 --> 35:47.884
Fine.

35:52.454 --> 35:54.500
They weren't happy with
the decision that I made,

35:54.543 --> 35:56.850
but my reasoning was sound,

35:56.893 --> 35:57.894
and they saw that.

35:57.938 --> 36:01.289
No, no, they never
see everything.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.944
Far as I'm concerned...

36:03.987 --> 36:07.077
you saved our asses, and I'm
never gonna forget that, Mandy.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.733
I know.

36:10.777 --> 36:12.866
What's going on? You okay?

36:12.909 --> 36:13.867
I'm fine.

36:13.910 --> 36:15.651
I'm not buying it.

36:15.695 --> 36:16.913
I know you, something's up.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.743
I'm tired.

36:20.787 --> 36:22.092
Yeah?

36:24.094 --> 36:26.532
You should probably
say something.

36:26.575 --> 36:28.925
Everybody's gonna want
to hear from you.

36:28.969 --> 36:31.165
I got something to say. I'll say
a toast, but are you okay?

36:31.189 --> 36:33.950
Stop trying to read me. I just
told you, everything's fine. All right.

36:35.584 --> 36:37.586
I'd like to make a toast.

36:43.810 --> 36:47.814
There are 46 special operators
in this room.

36:47.857 --> 36:52.645
655 years of total service.

36:52.688 --> 36:57.476
439 years of deployment.

36:57.519 --> 37:00.827
130 of those years deployed
to war.

37:00.870 --> 37:06.267
There are 21 divorces among us.

37:06.311 --> 37:10.358
54 kids affected
by those breakups.

37:11.403 --> 37:14.362
17 Purple Hearts.

37:14.406 --> 37:16.364
104 Bronze Stars.

37:16.408 --> 37:18.975
Three Silver Stars.

37:19.019 --> 37:23.763
There are 24 shoulder
and arm surgeries.

37:23.806 --> 37:27.680
64 leg and ankle surgeries.

37:27.723 --> 37:30.944
22 back and neck surgeries.

37:30.987 --> 37:34.208
And 34 people in this room
with hearing loss.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.907
And all of us with a little bit
of what Brett had.

37:37.951 --> 37:40.214
Every single one of us.

37:40.258 --> 37:44.000
That's a lot of pain for us
to, to carry around, but...

37:44.044 --> 37:46.742
I'm not trading that pain in
for anything,

37:46.786 --> 37:49.615
'cause that's what makes us
who we are.

37:49.658 --> 37:52.400
Yeah? Cheers.

38:04.412 --> 38:06.284
It's a beautiful day.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.981
Yeah.

38:08.024 --> 38:10.026
It is.

39:36.939 --> 39:38.637
You did good, Lisa.

40:47.183 --> 40:48.924
I'm always gonna be here
for you, all right?

40:48.968 --> 40:51.623
I love you.

40:51.666 --> 40:53.755
Love you, too. I know.

42:46.085 --> 42:47.347
Whiskey?

42:47.390 --> 42:49.654
Whiskey.

42:56.835 --> 42:59.228
How you doing, ?

42:59.272 --> 43:01.274
How am I doing?
