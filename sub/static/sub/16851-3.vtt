(female narrator)
 Previously on Childrens
 Hospital

00:03.437 --> 00:04.505
You're a sellout!

00:04.538 --> 00:05.573
You're a Ronald McDonald
paint job!

00:05.606 --> 00:07.608
Hey! I don't like
the "p" word.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.043
(male #1)
'Oh! Sorry, nurse.'

00:09.077 --> 00:11.079
We thought the new doctor
was coming in.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.446
She did just come in.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.783
First of all, you mean
"he" just came in.

00:15.816 --> 00:19.253
No, I most definitely
did not mean "he."

00:19.287 --> 00:21.055
- I'm an Aquarius.
- You're an Aquarius.

00:21.089 --> 00:23.391
What a coincidence.
I'm bisexual.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.359
And that's why
I'm leaving Childrens Hospital.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.161
'And I will never,
ever return.'

00:27.195 --> 00:30.531
And so...I would like
to take this chance to say..

00:30.564 --> 00:33.201
Insecure slut.
I know you're bulimic.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.436
'You're my nemesis.
Don't really know you.'

00:35.469 --> 00:40.208
I've always loved you.
And last but not least..

00:40.241 --> 00:41.275
...pass.

00:41.309 --> 00:44.212
[theme music]

00:47.348 --> 00:49.750
Hey, did you guys hear
about that thing about sports?

00:49.783 --> 00:51.852
- Yeah.
- Ugh!

00:51.885 --> 00:53.754
I hate men.

00:53.787 --> 00:58.159
On the way here, some guy
asked me to flash my breasts.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.194
- Did he have a video camera?
- Not even.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.430
Oh, then I'm just as mad
as you are.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.864
I'm just...
I'm tired of being objectified.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.600
You know what you should do?

01:06.634 --> 01:08.836
You should get naked.
You'd be making a statement.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.871
- Reclaiming your nudity.
- You know what? You're right.

01:10.904 --> 01:16.110
I-I am no longer going to be
shackled...by these objects..

01:16.144 --> 01:18.312
...of-of oppression.

01:18.346 --> 01:22.883
From now on,
this emperor has new clothes.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.652
'Skin clothes.'

01:24.685 --> 01:26.654
[knocking on door]

01:28.522 --> 01:29.657
Hey, Val'.

01:29.690 --> 01:33.394
- Hi.
- Can I crash here for a while?

01:33.427 --> 01:35.729
Um..

01:35.763 --> 01:38.499
...sure.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.600
God.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.435
Um, funny story.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.272
Uh, I got a new landlord,
and she doesn't like clowns.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.906
Weird. I mean,
who doesn't like clowns?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.542
Anyway, there's a special sink
for you in the corner.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.844
you and your clown-folk,
if they ever come over

01:50.878 --> 01:53.781
which you have to run by us.
And the answer's no.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.850
Cool. Hey, you guys heard
that thing about sports?

01:56.884 --> 01:58.452
- Follow me, Blake.
- Okay, thanks.

01:58.486 --> 02:01.455
Hey, totally unrelated.
Are you naked right now?

02:01.489 --> 02:05.326
Okay, you're gonna feel
a little pinch.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.660
Aah!

02:06.694 --> 02:07.828
(male #1)
'Righteous.'

02:10.364 --> 02:11.832
I'm looking for Dr. Lola Spratt.

02:11.865 --> 02:15.236
Tall, skin like
an airbrushed centerfold.

02:15.269 --> 02:19.473
Legs that go all the way up
to make an ass outta themselves.

02:19.507 --> 02:23.544
Huh. Lola is a girl's name.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.346
I thought girls
can't be doctors.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.216
Maybe I'm looking for a girl
to play...a doctor.

02:29.817 --> 02:30.818
What happened?

02:30.851 --> 02:33.321
You left here out of the blue.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.822
Well, I'm back now.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.831
- I'm back now.
- You should be careful.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.667
Once you come back,
you never go back.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.472
Hey, d'you hear about that thing
about politics?

02:51.505 --> 02:52.940
Don't even.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.975
You guys didn't
use my concealer, did you?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.411
Yeah. Sorry. I used a little
on my back.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.579
Speaking of makeup.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.614
How are we gonna get
Blake outta here?

03:00.648 --> 03:03.684
I know. I feel bad not letting
him use the front door

03:03.717 --> 03:05.553
but, that's the way
things are.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.389
I don't. He wants to live here,
he follows the rules.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.623
'Speaks only when spoken to.'

03:09.657 --> 03:10.924
He's not allowed to vote

03:10.958 --> 03:12.960
and he eats his meals
under the table.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.396
- I'm gonna go take a shower.
- I'll join you.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.731
Gonna take a shower
on the way to work.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.202
[dramatic music]

03:47.861 --> 03:50.264
Looks like you've had
a pretty bad pinch here.

03:50.298 --> 03:52.266
- Does it hurt when I do this?
- Ow!

03:54.968 --> 03:55.969
Hey.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.505
- I'm Dr. Brian.
- Hi.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.341
I used to work here,
but I left several years ago

04:00.374 --> 04:02.576
to be a consultant
on a TV medical drama.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.812
Oh, right, "Black Hospital",
starring Marlon Wayans.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.680
I loved that program.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.382
- Do you know him?
- Wayans?

04:08.416 --> 04:10.284
Taught him
everything he knows.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.552
[laughing]

04:11.585 --> 04:13.053
That's funny.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.489
I'm sure you didn't teach him
everything he knows.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.925
You probably only taught him
what it's like to be..

04:17.958 --> 04:19.026
...a black doctor.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.827
You got me!

04:20.861 --> 04:23.597
He knows way more than
just the black doctor stuff.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.033
Hey, do you want
to get a drink after work?

04:26.066 --> 04:27.868
You know,
maybe I can show you

04:27.901 --> 04:31.038
some of the things that
Marlon Wayans taught me.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.773
About having sex.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.742
Oh!

04:34.775 --> 04:39.880
I-I can't. Lola's my friend,
and, um, I'm also pretty racist.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.048
- Hey!
- Hi.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.050
- Hey.
- The women here are off limits.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.885
You didn't see me
on the set

04:44.918 --> 04:47.521
of "Black Hospital" trying to
bang Marlon Wayans, did you?

04:47.555 --> 04:49.390
We're not dating anymore.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.625
- You dated Marlon Wayans?
- I meant me and you.

04:51.659 --> 04:54.528
- There is no "me and you."
- That's what I just said.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.564
Well, yeah, but in a
roundabout kinda way.

04:56.597 --> 04:57.931
Then how about this?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.633
I can date whoever I want.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.602
Yeah? Well, I'm pretty
well-liked around here

05:01.635 --> 05:04.672
and if I give the word,
you'll be on the "black list".

05:04.705 --> 05:06.440
If you get my double meaning.

05:06.474 --> 05:10.811
Blake, aren't you looking
for the multicolored rest room?

05:10.844 --> 05:13.381
- Not today.
- Oh, my God!

05:21.955 --> 05:25.526
I know a bar that will
let anybody use their toilets.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.960
Let's go.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.796
I've never noticed that
about fat people.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.364
It's true.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.600
Hey, I really loved your show,
by the way.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.602
- It really spoke to me.
- Thanks, man.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.504
Marlon Wayans has a real talent

05:36.537 --> 05:38.806
for the personalization
of the struggleties

05:38.839 --> 05:39.840
(both together)
of 'Peoplehoodedness.

05:39.873 --> 05:40.874
Alright.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.676
- Catchy slogan.
- I wrote it.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.512
I just wish
I could live it.

05:44.545 --> 05:48.015
Oh, well, hey, at least
you're not a clown, right?

05:48.048 --> 05:50.951
I hope you're not
comparing the struggle

05:50.984 --> 05:52.453
of black people
to clowns.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.087
Brian, wake up.
There's a black president.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.456
Your fight's over.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.825
Never been a clown president,
alright?

05:57.858 --> 05:59.860
Unless you count James Monroe,
and I don't.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.595
I do not.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.464
Blacks were enslaved
for centuries.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.599
Tens of decades even.
There's no comparison.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.635
Blacks and gays
have it easy now, okay?

06:07.668 --> 06:10.170
And black gays? Forget about it.
Look at Will Smith.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.039
You're not being
very righteous right now.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.675
What're you gonna do, Brian?
Run for office against me?

06:14.708 --> 06:17.611
Well, maybe, I'll tell
everybody your little secret.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.146
Oh...yeah.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.949
I've known you since the 70s,
blue and red.

06:21.982 --> 06:26.086
I know what you're really hiding
under all that grease.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.560
I know,
Blake stole my shotgun.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.595
It's gotta be here
somewhere in his stuff.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.930
Cat, can I just say
that you look really..

06:36.964 --> 06:38.432
...really empowered
right now?

06:38.466 --> 06:40.468
Thanks, Val,
but I'm kinda cold.

06:40.501 --> 06:44.872
And there's no comfy place
to put your chap stick.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.575
Guess that's just the...price
of being empowered, you know?

06:47.608 --> 06:53.080
I just want to feel how
empowered you are, with this.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.916
- Hey, check this out.
- Oh, wow.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.518
So cute when they're kids.

06:57.551 --> 07:00.187
Yeah. Too bad
such an adorable kid can grow up

07:00.220 --> 07:03.491
to steal a shotgun and probably
kill us all with it.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.826
'Hey, wait a second.
What's this?'

07:05.859 --> 07:07.027
- His journal.
- Score.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.062
Oh.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.131
"Cat,'Meow' is right."

07:11.164 --> 07:12.866
"Her handsome personality
is only

07:12.900 --> 07:15.135
"overshadowed
by her radiant beauty.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.070
I would never kill
any of them."

07:17.104 --> 07:18.806
I feel terrible.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.041
I'll see your terrible feeling
and I'll raise it

07:21.074 --> 07:22.576
with a great idea.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.713
I know just how we can
make it up to him.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.985
(Lola)
'So, I've just told
all the women here'

07:32.019 --> 07:34.622
that I'll fight
them if they go out with you.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.256
It's not that important to me.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.692
Okay. I'll tell you why
I'm wearing clown makeup.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.227
I didn't ask.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.930
We decided to let Blake join
our group. Jealous much?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.532
What happened to you,
Lola?

07:44.565 --> 07:47.100
You used to be sweet
and a little slutty.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.571
Now...your heart
is as black as..

07:50.604 --> 07:52.840
I don't know anything
as black as your heart.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.808
Well, you know what they say.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.811
Once you go black, it's-it's
hard to think of anything--

08:01.281 --> 08:03.116
We can't.
I can't.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.152
We're...too different.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.188
We're like...pandas
and zebras.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.858
(Glenn)
'Blake's coming, everybody!'

08:10.891 --> 08:13.293
I have to go.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.562
This isn't over.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.672
[applause]

08:28.809 --> 08:30.711
I don't-I don't get it.

08:30.744 --> 08:34.982
We accept you, Blake.
You're one of us now.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.885
Or maybe we're one of you.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.888
Or, maybe, we're all the same.

08:40.921 --> 08:45.125
Or...maybe we're just not so
different after all. You see?

08:45.158 --> 08:47.961
No. I still don't get it.
Why are you wearing makeup?

08:47.995 --> 08:50.598
We accept you...and this
is symbolic of our acceptance.

08:50.631 --> 08:51.965
Blah, blah, blah.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.001
Yeah, but why were you
clapping so slowly?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.936
We...forget it.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.607
Wait! Don't you guys wanna know
Blake's real secret?

08:59.640 --> 09:01.008
Brian, what are you doing?

09:01.041 --> 09:03.677
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Brian, what are you doing?

09:03.711 --> 09:05.946
See, guys?
Look. It's me.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.616
I guess, I'm not
so different now, am I?

09:08.649 --> 09:10.050
(Owen)
'Oh, my God.
Blake's black.'

09:10.083 --> 09:11.151
[all gasp]

09:11.184 --> 09:12.185
- Say what?
- Wait.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.854
I still don't get it.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.790
- Ugh!
- Oh, my God.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.358
That's confusing.
That's confusing.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.794
You know what?
I don't care if you're black.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.697
I'm pissed off.
You're a jackass.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.733
(thinking)
 Well, everything
 was resolved..

09:25.766 --> 09:27.367
...except Blake doesn't
 understand what we're doing.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.638
I guess Brian and I
 still have a lot to work out.

09:30.671 --> 09:33.073
There's a weird lesbian thing
 on between Cat and Val.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.808
Kinda in the middle of that.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.644
Was there something
 about a shotgun missing?

09:36.677 --> 09:37.745
Oh, and Blake's black.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.647
Oh, no.

09:39.680 --> 09:43.083
Have I ever said the "n" word
 in front of him? Eh, who cares?

09:48.021 --> 09:50.190
Hello, I'm Matthew Perry.

09:50.223 --> 09:53.727
There's been a lot of talk about
race and identity here today.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.963
If you and your family
wanna find out more

09:55.996 --> 09:59.900
please check out,
