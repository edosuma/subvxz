Sir, I cannot accept a bribe.

17:29.795 --> 17:32.562
And I certainly cannot
give you change for a bribe.

17:32.564 --> 17:34.865
You don't understand
how important it is

17:34.867 --> 17:37.167
for me to get this ticket!

17:37.169 --> 17:39.870
I will do anything.

17:39.872 --> 17:41.638
Anything.

17:42.673 --> 17:44.641
Perhaps Karen wants

17:44.643 --> 17:46.743
to get her groove back?

17:46.745 --> 17:49.312
There is one thing you can do.

17:49.314 --> 17:50.314
Name it.

17:50.315 --> 17:52.749
You can give me $1,100.

17:52.751 --> 17:54.818
I just... I just need
to get to that gate

17:54.820 --> 17:56.353
before my girlfriend
boards that plane.

17:56.355 --> 17:58.455
I-I need to tell her
that-that I-I love her

17:58.457 --> 18:01.124
and I was wrong and I want
to spend my life with her.

18:01.126 --> 18:02.959
I'm sorry, you should've
mentioned that before.

18:02.961 --> 18:07.030
We have a special fare
for big romantic gestures.

18:07.032 --> 18:10.333
And it's $1,100.

18:11.169 --> 18:12.602
Fine.

18:12.604 --> 18:14.738
I'll go.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.009
Karen: 1,100.

18:19.011 --> 18:21.945
Love: zero.

Walden, this is kind of

19:13.298 --> 19:15.999
I dumped you, and now
you want to be with me

19:16.001 --> 19:18.201
because you want
what you can't have.

19:18.203 --> 19:20.303
Oh, God, you're so smart.
Let's make out.

19:20.305 --> 19:21.504
I'm serious.

19:21.506 --> 19:23.006

I can't hear you peeing.

19:29.715 --> 19:31.314
Plus, we're good
in bed together.

19:31.316 --> 19:32.716
True.

19:32.718 --> 19:34.384
Although, after Alan,
anyone was gonna look good.

19:34.386 --> 19:36.653
Okay, I will give you,
like, a billion dollars

19:36.655 --> 19:39.122
if you never
bring that up again.

19:39.124 --> 19:40.624

something-- just ask.

19:42.628 --> 19:45.762
Why can't you be my husband?

19:51.335 --> 19:53.970
I have to admit, it
would be kind of nice

19:53.972 --> 19:55.972
to have Bolton singing right now.

20:20.805 --> 20:22.171
uh, a boarding pass.

20:22.173 --> 20:24.474
But if you will let me
go to that gate,

20:24.476 --> 20:26.976
I'll do anything.

20:26.978 --> 20:29.779
Anything.

Yes. With America.
