WEBVTT

01:13.615 --> 01:15.242
Sorry, Caitlin.

02:53.966 --> 02:56.134
Oh, Caitlin.

02:57.636 --> 03:00.055
l am so sorry.

03:18.282 --> 03:20.409
Why me, Gibbs?

03:22.035 --> 03:24.204
Wasn't stopping
one bullet enough for you?

03:26.915 --> 03:29.459
Why did l have to take two?

03:32.504 --> 03:34.339
l don't know.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.384
You don't know?

03:37.718 --> 03:42.347
Come on, Gibbs,
what's that famous gut tell you?

03:44.933 --> 03:47.561
Why did l die instead of you?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.691
Found Ari's sniper's nest, boss.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.277
Roof of an abandoned
office building to the east.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.070
Didn't police his brass.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.709
They're Lapua .308s.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.295
l didn't mean
that you couldn't see that, boss.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.882
l can't without my glasses.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.595
Lapua's match-grade sniper ammo.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.015
You guys find any bullets?

04:25.557 --> 04:26.767
None that match the casings.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.894
l left three guys on the roof
searching.

04:30.229 --> 04:32.272
McGee and l
will go back to the roof, boss.

04:33.398 --> 04:37.194
Tony, you're soaking wet.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.321
Go put some dry clothes on.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.744
Ari's rooftop
wasn't much higher than ours.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.670
Rooflines behind us were lower.

04:55.254 --> 04:58.340
No telling how far a full metal jacket
bullet would go,

04:59.049 --> 05:00.592
after killing Kate.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.264
How's he know
it's a full metal jacket?

05:05.931 --> 05:07.641
Didn't you see Kate?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.727
l didn't want to.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.605
Her head was intact.

05:14.773 --> 05:18.527
Oh, so she didn't look bad?

05:19.319 --> 05:22.030
No. No, not at all, Probie.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.450
ln fact, a little mortuary putty
right here

05:25.951 --> 05:27.160
and she'll be good as new.

05:27.369 --> 05:30.581
Of course, she was having a bad hair
day, though, right back here.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.208
A full metal jacket will put
a hole the size of a grapefruit

05:33.375 --> 05:34.543
- right about there.
- Tony.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.213
Please.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.967
Sorry, kid.

05:42.885 --> 05:46.096
Three rounds. Only one hit?

05:46.305 --> 05:47.806
He must've popped off
a couple rounds

05:47.973 --> 05:49.474
when we were weaving
across the roof.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.852
l was standing still
when Kate was shot.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.980
McGee lasered the distance
at nearly 600 metres.

05:55.147 --> 05:56.648
Five seventy-two.

05:58.692 --> 06:02.321
Slight shift in the wind, he misses you.
He hits Kate.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.621
There was no wind.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.123
What are you saying?
He was aiming at Kate?

06:14.625 --> 06:17.586
- You're the one he wants to kill.
- Ari had a thing for Kate.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.004
What are you talking about?

06:19.171 --> 06:22.090
She told me that he was always
coming on to her. ln Autopsy,

06:22.299 --> 06:24.510
when he kidnapped her
and let her go.

06:24.676 --> 06:25.886
She never told me that.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.388
- Gee, what a surprise.
- What?

06:29.681 --> 06:30.891
Don't do that, Tony.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.355
When was this hit, Tim?

06:41.360 --> 06:42.778
When l was pinned down.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.405
Ari have a shot at it?

06:52.371 --> 06:55.999
A car was between the terrorist
and the controller.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.918
There's no way
he could have hit it.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.463
l'm sorry. l should've realized
that it was Ari.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.632
- Why didn't he pop McGee?
- Oh, thanks, Tony.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.677
All l'm saying is you're
a sizeable target. The controller isn't.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.262
- Are you saying l'm fat?
- No.

07:08.470 --> 07:12.266
All right, maybe a little
around the waist, under the chin.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.142
He didn't have an angle on Tim.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.188
You owe that shooter
from the warehouse a thank-you.

07:18.397 --> 07:19.815
He saved your life.

07:21.316 --> 07:24.236
The bullet entered here.
lt could have ricocheted into the car.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.321
l'll-- l'll get on it.

07:26.572 --> 07:29.074
- Abby should be in by now.
- Tony,

07:29.283 --> 07:31.785
see what you can pull off that brass.

07:37.583 --> 07:41.587
l'm going for coffee.
Can l get you boys some?

07:42.921 --> 07:44.798
- No.
- No, thanks.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.387
That's a first.

07:51.889 --> 07:55.100
- He called me Tim.
- He patted my back.

07:55.601 --> 07:57.769
lt's kind of nice.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.189
Nice?

08:00.731 --> 08:04.985
l don't want nice.
He's not Gibbs if he's nice.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.940
You're a mess, girl.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.359
Red eyes. No makeup.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.862
lf ever there was a time
for black lipstick, it's now.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.877
Remember when we first met?

09:06.463 --> 09:11.051
l couldn't believe
you were a forensic scientist.

09:11.593 --> 09:15.848
l thought goths had bats for pets
or vice-versa.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.936
l really liked you, Kate.

09:21.478 --> 09:22.980
A lot.

09:23.188 --> 09:26.441
Don't start that again.
Where are your pigtails?

09:26.900 --> 09:29.403
l love you in pigtails.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.618
That's better.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.871
You were persistent, Abs.

09:39.079 --> 09:42.916
First, the dark lipstick.
Then the black nail polish.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.752
Next thing you know,
l have a tat on my bum.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.382
Oh, God. Ducky's gonna see it.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.637
l'm dead and l'm embarrassed.

10:01.894 --> 10:03.562
Abby.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.731
Hey, Tony.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.150
Are you okay?

10:08.942 --> 10:13.363
l will be as soon as
l tie up my pigtails.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.240
There.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.075
What can l do for you?

10:19.244 --> 10:21.663
- What?
- You're weirder than Gibbs.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.749
How so?

10:24.166 --> 10:25.375
He's being nice.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.461
Gibbs is always nice.

10:27.669 --> 10:28.795
To you and Ducky, maybe.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.798
Me, he growls at
and smacks on the head.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.259
Which makes you feel wanted.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.345
Yeah.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.347
What do you got for me?

10:42.726 --> 10:44.561
.308 casings from Ari's sniper's nest.

10:47.189 --> 10:50.734
You would have to give me
the most popular calibre in the world.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.402
Well, hey, l just found them.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.488
Can you tell what weapon he used?

10:54.696 --> 10:56.990
- A .308.
- What model .308?

10:57.199 --> 10:59.451
- You don't know?
- Would l be asking?

10:59.660 --> 11:03.413
- Well, how am l supposed to know?
- Because you're the firearms expert.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.834
That l am.

11:08.460 --> 11:12.673
And when l'm done,
l will tell you the propellant, the primer,

11:12.881 --> 11:15.509
the percentage of nickel and copper
in the brass,

11:15.717 --> 11:18.512
whether or not all three rounds
were fired from the same weapon

11:18.679 --> 11:21.306
which you assume,
but l can prove or disprove.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.976
l will tell you
who manufactured the ammo,

11:24.142 --> 11:26.603
the batch number
and, perhaps, where it was sold.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.772
l will also,
with some degree of accuracy,

11:28.939 --> 11:31.400
tell you if it was fired
from a lever-action,

11:31.608 --> 11:34.987
a bolt-action, a semi-automatic
or an automatic weapon.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.448
However, there is no way in hell
l could tell you

11:38.615 --> 11:44.496
which of the 87 different .308 models
fired those rounds.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.583
The rounds are Lapua.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.670
What?

11:52.880 --> 11:55.090
Lapua made the ammo.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.260
Logo's on the rim.

12:01.597 --> 12:04.391
Tony, l'm gonna miss her.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.937
Me too.

12:34.270 --> 12:37.190
- You hit?
- No.

12:37.732 --> 12:39.776
- You're heavy.
- Sorry.

12:44.614 --> 12:46.950
No wonder you're so heavy.
Tony, you're all muscle.

12:47.158 --> 12:48.827
Abby:

12:49.119 --> 12:51.454
Packing a nice booty too.

12:51.663 --> 12:54.290
Hey, is this how you deal
with getting shot at?

12:54.499 --> 12:56.459
- l don't know. lt's my first time.
- Abby.

12:56.668 --> 12:59.379
Boss, down. We're taking fire.

13:26.364 --> 13:27.907
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

13:28.658 --> 13:30.869
Close off Anacostia Park
between the bridges.

13:31.077 --> 13:34.581
- Tell Metro cops it's a crime scene.
- Okay, right.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.293
What if he has a night-vision scope?

13:38.751 --> 13:40.003
That's a good point, boss.

13:42.505 --> 13:44.382
l will get you bullet-proof glass.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.677
- There's no such thing, Gibbs.
- Okay, bullet-resistant glass.

13:52.515 --> 13:56.186
Ari didn't shoot at you
and hit Kate by mistake, did he?

13:57.145 --> 13:58.229
He's after me now.

13:58.438 --> 14:01.024
l was walking by that window
when he fired.

14:01.566 --> 14:03.693
You're just saying that
to make me feel safe.

14:04.944 --> 14:07.322
l'll keep you safe, Abby.

14:08.740 --> 14:10.658
l promise.

14:27.550 --> 14:30.678
l appreciate your keeping me covered
in front of the others.

14:30.845 --> 14:32.555
Especially Tony.

14:32.764 --> 14:35.225
Yes, l know how modest you are.

14:37.352 --> 14:39.104
Were.

14:39.395 --> 14:41.606
l'm dead now, Ducky.

14:43.525 --> 14:44.567
Shouldn't be.

14:44.943 --> 14:47.445
l could have killed Ari right here.
ln Autopsy.

14:52.075 --> 14:54.452
Why did you hesitate?

14:56.204 --> 14:58.039
His eyes.

15:00.125 --> 15:04.462
There was something in his eyes
that made me not wanna kill him.

15:05.839 --> 15:09.050
His eyes were ice to me.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.223
Ari fired into Abby's lab.

15:15.640 --> 15:16.850
Good Lord.

15:17.392 --> 15:19.686
lt had to come from across the river
in Anacostia Park.

15:19.853 --> 15:21.312
Was Abigail hurt?

15:21.871 --> 15:24.332
No, she's a little shook up.
Tony's with her.

15:24.540 --> 15:25.792
ln the lab?

15:26.375 --> 15:29.629
ln the squad room
writing up an incident report.

15:31.005 --> 15:33.883
You should have brought in
another M.E., Duck.

15:35.927 --> 15:37.553
Couldn't.

15:38.221 --> 15:39.931
Not for Caitlin.

15:41.974 --> 15:44.477
l've lost men in combat.

15:46.229 --> 15:49.524
You hope you won't.
You know you will.

15:50.358 --> 15:53.361
- This is different.
- But it shouldn't be.

15:53.861 --> 15:55.279
Kate was an agent.

15:55.446 --> 15:58.449
She knew she had to lay her life
on the line.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.576
But you're right.

16:02.245 --> 16:03.329
lt's different.

16:03.704 --> 16:05.331
Well, you just said it.

16:05.540 --> 16:08.835
You've lost men.
Have you ever lost a woman?

16:09.585 --> 16:13.131
Let's face it, Jethro, you and l
are a couple of old chauvinists.

16:13.339 --> 16:18.219
Women will never be equal in our eyes
until they're equal in death.

16:18.427 --> 16:19.929
Why, Ducky?

16:20.138 --> 16:21.597
Why Kate? Why not me?

16:21.806 --> 16:24.183
- Well, maybe he meant to hit you.
- No.

16:24.392 --> 16:27.228
No, him sniping Abby
means he's after my people.

16:27.436 --> 16:28.646
Women first.

16:28.813 --> 16:30.606
Then he's torturing you.

16:31.149 --> 16:34.152
One has to wonder
what made him such a sadist.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.487
l don't give a damn.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.239
l just wanna kill the bastard.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.078
Hey, McGee, take a look at this.

16:47.039 --> 16:50.126
l think it's a .308.

16:51.210 --> 16:54.338
Stop staring at my butt
and get me an evidence jar.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.301
Drop it.

17:04.432 --> 17:07.393
Oh, l found another one.

17:07.643 --> 17:11.689
Boss, we found a .308 slug.

17:13.232 --> 17:16.068
Two. They were plugged
in the trunk.

17:16.444 --> 17:18.195
These fired by the dirtbag
in the warehouse?

17:18.404 --> 17:22.825
Yes. Those l found in the right side
of the car. Nine mil slugs.

17:22.992 --> 17:26.078
Ari missed with his first shot.
Hit the controller with the second.

17:26.287 --> 17:28.330
Where were you
before you took cover?

17:28.539 --> 17:30.625
Right here.

17:31.501 --> 17:35.546
Tony's right.
You do owe that terrorist a thank-you.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.304
He didn't police his brass again.

17:43.471 --> 17:46.974
Metro P.D. found a .308 casing
in the park next to tyre tracks.

17:47.141 --> 17:48.559
- And?
- Nothing.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.521
l was waiting for you to tell me to
tell them to bring the evidence.

17:51.729 --> 17:53.231
l have to tell you that, DiNozzo?

17:53.856 --> 17:55.441
You always do.

17:56.067 --> 17:58.736
- Tell Metro P.D. to--
- Already did, boss.

18:00.071 --> 18:03.866
Oh, and by the way, the director
wants to see you up in MTAC.

18:08.830 --> 18:10.331
Why are you baiting Gibbs?

18:10.540 --> 18:13.417
l'm trying to get him
to stop being nice.

18:14.460 --> 18:15.711
l like him nice.

18:22.885 --> 18:24.595
Signal is strong.
We have a solid channel.

18:25.346 --> 18:26.931
Distributing the infrared--

18:29.308 --> 18:30.518
What do you have?

18:31.519 --> 18:34.981
Brass from Ari's sniper's nest.
Three bullets.

18:35.189 --> 18:37.233
Tyre tracks in Anacostia Park

18:37.775 --> 18:41.529
from where he fired a shot
across the river into our forensics lab.

18:41.737 --> 18:44.991
Unusual for a sniper not to police his
brass, isn't it?

18:45.199 --> 18:47.618
- Yes, sir.
- l've received calls

18:47.785 --> 18:50.872
from every director l know promising
to hunt down this sniper

18:51.038 --> 18:53.124
as if he'd killed one of their own.

18:53.332 --> 18:57.462
FBl might be the most help.
Ari Haswari is their mole.

18:58.754 --> 19:00.339
l endorsed your recommendation

19:00.506 --> 19:04.927
to award the Presidential Medal
of Freedom to Special Agent Todd.

19:05.386 --> 19:08.890
- Thank you, sir.
- According to your after-action report,

19:09.056 --> 19:11.726
no one actually saw the sniper
who killed Agent Todd.

19:11.934 --> 19:15.062
Ari was on a rooftop
600 metres away.

19:15.271 --> 19:17.982
- Extraordinary shot.
- No, sir. Not really.

19:19.567 --> 19:22.403
- You were a sniper with the Corps?
- Two tours.

19:22.612 --> 19:24.280
Vietnam?

19:24.530 --> 19:25.698
l'm not that old, sir.

19:26.282 --> 19:28.910
Panama and Desert Storm.

19:29.118 --> 19:31.913
- l thought you were older.
- Target vehicle approaching.

19:34.415 --> 19:35.708
<i>We have a hard lock.</i>

19:35.917 --> 19:37.376
Target confirmed. Engage.

19:37.668 --> 19:38.836
<i>Weapon free.</i>

19:40.338 --> 19:41.672
<i>Good lock. On target.</i>

19:48.721 --> 19:50.807
Well done.

19:51.015 --> 19:52.475
Good job, everyone.

19:52.683 --> 19:53.768
Where was l?

19:53.976 --> 20:00.024
Avoiding using Ari's name and the word
''sniper'' in the same sentence, sir.

20:00.233 --> 20:03.361
Your anger is understandable, Jethro.
You lost an agent.

20:03.569 --> 20:06.697
- You want payback.
- Don't you, sir?

20:06.989 --> 20:08.407
lt's a passion l can't afford.

20:08.783 --> 20:10.451
Do you honestly think it wasn't Ari?

20:10.660 --> 20:13.371
No. But there are those who do.

20:14.330 --> 20:15.915
Those who ran him.

20:16.124 --> 20:19.335
Those who thought they had
the holy grail of moles.

20:19.544 --> 20:22.046
Those people covering their asses
right now.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.298
Make sure you cover yours
when you bring him in.

20:24.507 --> 20:26.384
Won't be a problem, sir.

20:26.592 --> 20:29.095
l won't be bringing him in.

20:32.014 --> 20:34.934
Anyway, you're not my problem
anymore, Jethro.

20:35.393 --> 20:37.728
You firing me, sir?

20:38.980 --> 20:43.067
l've been offered a deputy director's
position at Homeland Security.

20:44.694 --> 20:46.863
You'd leave NClS, sir?

20:47.655 --> 20:50.116
Well, the agency could use
some younger blood.

20:50.992 --> 20:52.702
Well, who'll be replacing you,
sir?

20:54.954 --> 20:56.581
Not me.

20:57.248 --> 21:01.252
Much as l like you, Jethro,
l would not shoot NClS in the head.

21:03.171 --> 21:05.798
He's your problem now, director.

21:11.596 --> 21:12.889
Hello, Jethro.

21:25.026 --> 21:28.488
Should we skip the
''you haven't changed a bit'' bull?

21:29.781 --> 21:32.867
Why start lying
to each other now, Jen?

21:34.452 --> 21:36.370
Any problem taking orders from me?

21:36.746 --> 21:38.790
As director or as a woman?

21:39.582 --> 21:40.875
Either.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.087
lt was six years ago.

21:45.713 --> 21:48.007
The past won't be a problem.

21:51.052 --> 21:52.970
You were a damn good agent

21:53.429 --> 21:55.348
especially undercover.

21:56.682 --> 21:58.434
Jethro.

21:59.977 --> 22:02.188
Madam Director.

22:10.696 --> 22:13.783
You have no physical evidence
linking Ari to the shootings.

22:13.991 --> 22:15.910
No wonder agencies
here and abroad have doubts.

22:16.119 --> 22:18.496
Bastard killed one of my people.
He's trying to kill more.

22:18.663 --> 22:21.999
l'll tell you something else. No suit with
a tight sphincter is getting in my way,

22:22.166 --> 22:23.376
and that includes you, Jen.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.879
Special Agent Gibbs.

22:36.055 --> 22:40.017
On the job,
it is Director Shepard or ma'am.

22:40.226 --> 22:41.811
Okay. What about off the job?

22:42.019 --> 22:45.106
There won't be any ''off the job,''
Agent Gibbs.

22:45.314 --> 22:47.525
That's too bad.

22:48.151 --> 22:49.861
l missed you, Jen.

22:51.612 --> 22:53.489
Don't make this difficult, Jethro.

22:54.991 --> 22:57.660
Fair enough. lt won't happen again.

23:00.621 --> 23:02.290
Director.

23:07.170 --> 23:09.380
We can continue
this conversation in private.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.841
l've gotta change my clothes.
We can talk in my car.

23:12.049 --> 23:14.135
- Gibbs.
- Hey, l got a dead agent

23:14.302 --> 23:17.930
and a sniper on the loose.
l do not have 1 0 minutes to spare.

23:18.389 --> 23:19.432
Tony, where are we?

23:19.640 --> 23:21.642
McGee and Abby
are working firearms analysis.

23:21.851 --> 23:26.313
- l'm matching tyre tracks to vehicles.
- No one is to leave the building.

23:26.480 --> 23:29.692
McGee's on protection detail
with Abby. l'll be back in an hour.

23:32.945 --> 23:36.323
Your mother should have washed
your mind out with soap.

23:37.033 --> 23:42.580
Gibbs leaves with a woman
and your only thought is: nooner.

23:42.788 --> 23:43.914
Was not.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.624
Was too.

23:45.833 --> 23:48.085
l've always known
what you were thinking, Tony.

23:51.213 --> 23:53.716
What?
What are you up to?

23:58.220 --> 24:03.184
Tony, l just died
and you're having a sexual fantasy?

24:03.934 --> 24:05.186
Can't help it.

24:07.938 --> 24:09.774
DiNozzo.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.777
Sometimes
l used to picture you naked.

24:19.617 --> 24:21.202
l'll call you back.

24:23.579 --> 24:24.747
Hi.

24:27.208 --> 24:28.501
l was just--

24:29.251 --> 24:30.836
Having phone sex?

24:31.045 --> 24:33.547
Phone sex? No.

24:34.423 --> 24:36.675
- Charades.
- Charades?

24:36.884 --> 24:38.677
- Like:
-You've played.

24:39.261 --> 24:41.389
Never on the telephone.

24:41.597 --> 24:42.973
Yeah.

24:43.349 --> 24:46.143
My partner and l were coming up
with quotes for Saturday night.

24:47.436 --> 24:49.271
You play charades
on Saturday night?

24:49.480 --> 24:51.691
To kill time before l go clubbing.
Who are you?

24:52.233 --> 24:54.026
Ziva David.

24:54.235 --> 24:55.277
Mossad.

24:56.612 --> 24:58.322
You're lsraeli?

24:58.572 --> 25:01.409
Very good.
The way you made that connection.

25:01.617 --> 25:03.911
Mossad, lsraeli.

25:05.204 --> 25:06.831
What can l do for you, Ms. David?

25:07.039 --> 25:10.543
Nothing.
l'm here to see Special Agent Gibbs.

25:11.377 --> 25:12.712
How do you know l'm not Gibbs?

25:20.928 --> 25:23.556
- Gibbs.
- He'll be back in an hour.

25:24.098 --> 25:25.808
Are you sure l can't help you?

25:28.060 --> 25:29.729
l don't think so.

25:34.984 --> 25:36.986
We got off to a bad start.

25:38.779 --> 25:42.324
l'm Special Agent Tony DiNozzo.
l wasn't playing charades.

25:42.533 --> 25:45.911
l was remembering my partner.

25:46.996 --> 25:49.415
- Naked?
- No.

25:49.832 --> 25:52.001
Yes. l--

25:53.794 --> 25:55.379
l was just--

25:56.338 --> 25:58.883
Look, l'm not the only man
who does it.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.260
Oh, women do it too.

26:04.555 --> 26:06.432
With handsome men.

26:10.061 --> 26:13.272
And even an occasional woman.

26:13.898 --> 26:15.232
Now you're teasing me.

26:16.150 --> 26:17.985
Didn't your partner tease you?

26:18.194 --> 26:21.530
Not about sex.
Kate was kind of puritanical.

26:22.156 --> 26:24.992
- Sorry.
- Well, it didn't matter.

26:25.201 --> 26:29.163
l wasn't interested in her.
We were partners.

26:31.957 --> 26:33.417
She wasn't attractive?

26:33.626 --> 26:36.921
She was, but not to me.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.715
Then why did you imagine her
naked?

26:42.927 --> 26:45.596
Miss David, you can sit there

26:45.763 --> 26:48.641
and slouch provocatively for an hour
if you'd like,

26:48.849 --> 26:52.228
or you could tell me what you need
and maybe l can help.

26:53.396 --> 26:56.232
You can't help because l'm here
to stop Special Agent Gibbs

26:56.399 --> 26:58.401
from killing a Mossad officer.

26:59.026 --> 27:00.361
Ari Haswari?

27:00.569 --> 27:02.196
Yes.

27:06.909 --> 27:11.330
l'd wish you luck,
but l want the bastard dead too.

27:15.918 --> 27:18.379
ls this the same boat
you were building six years ago?

27:18.587 --> 27:20.715
- Nope.
- What happened to it?

27:20.923 --> 27:23.801
- l burned her.
- Why would you--?

27:26.595 --> 27:28.389
You named it after an ex-wife.

27:31.058 --> 27:32.685
Let's go.

27:33.227 --> 27:37.023
- Which one?
- You know damn well which one.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.900
- Why didn't you change the name?
- Because it wouldn't matter.

27:40.067 --> 27:42.319
Every time l went out on her,
l'd think of Diane.

27:42.903 --> 27:44.030
You could have sold it.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.366
And watched some other guy
sail off on her?

27:47.575 --> 27:49.660
You didn't care
who sailed off on Diane.

27:52.288 --> 27:54.582
Leroy Jethro Gibbs,

27:54.790 --> 27:56.709
you are a strange man.

27:56.917 --> 27:58.627
Me.

28:00.254 --> 28:01.630
You were a good agent, Jen.

28:01.839 --> 28:03.841
- Were?
- Yeah.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.302
Director's job is pure politics.

28:06.510 --> 28:07.720
l'm good at politics.

28:07.928 --> 28:10.639
NClS needs someone who can shake
the money tree on the Hill

28:10.806 --> 28:12.016
and work with sister agencies.

28:12.224 --> 28:17.104
Wait, you won't call a boat a ''she,''
but it's ''sister agencies?''

28:17.313 --> 28:18.773
l'm a schizoid libber.

28:18.981 --> 28:21.150
lt comes from working
with chauvinists like you.

28:21.359 --> 28:25.404
l can't believe you would give up
field work for rubber chicken dinners.

28:25.613 --> 28:27.865
l don't think they serve
that dish at Palena.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.701
- Never heard of it.
- Why would you? lt isn't takeout.

28:30.910 --> 28:33.496
So which of the tight sphincters
is taking you out to dinner?

28:33.662 --> 28:36.707
Please tell me it's not Fornell.

28:37.458 --> 28:38.793
<i>CBS Early Show.</i>

28:39.001 --> 28:41.170
They want background
before l go on TV.

28:41.379 --> 28:43.881
Jen. Jen, you can't do that.

28:44.256 --> 28:45.633
Excuse me?

28:45.841 --> 28:47.176
Ari is a chauvinist.

28:47.385 --> 28:50.346
He is taking out the women
l work with before me.

28:50.971 --> 28:52.056
Jethro.

28:52.264 --> 28:55.726
People who should know
don't believe Ari Haswari is the sniper.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.896
And you haven't provided any evidence
to prove them wrong.

28:59.522 --> 29:01.399
Have you ever doubted me?

29:02.358 --> 29:04.568
Professionally? Never.

29:05.403 --> 29:07.405
Why are you doubting me now?

29:08.698 --> 29:12.993
l have to establish a working
relationship with these people.

29:13.994 --> 29:18.082
Who are you gonna side with, Jen?
Them or me.

29:20.334 --> 29:22.628
Give me a tough question.

29:31.887 --> 29:33.347
What is with this music?

29:33.556 --> 29:35.725
l'm playing it out of respect for Kate.

29:35.891 --> 29:37.935
l thought
you were from New Orleans.

29:38.102 --> 29:41.063
- So?
- Well, don't they play jazz at funerals?

29:43.566 --> 29:47.611
Coming from the cemetery
after the body has been buried.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.197
On the way to the cemetery,
we play a dirge.

29:50.406 --> 29:53.034
- Do you know what a dirge is, Timmy?
- Creepy music?

29:53.242 --> 29:55.119
Go back to the squad room
and let me do my job.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.537
l can't.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.373
Why?

30:01.792 --> 30:04.628
Gibbs-- Gibbs told me
to watch over you.

30:08.924 --> 30:12.762
That is so sweet.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.683
- You're from a wealthy family.
- Really?

30:17.892 --> 30:21.479
Born and raised on the East Coast.
New England boarding school.

30:21.687 --> 30:24.940
Spent some time in the Midwest.
And Philadelphia.

30:25.149 --> 30:27.151
How would you know that?

30:30.404 --> 30:32.073
Shalom, Jen.

30:32.948 --> 30:34.241
Shalom.

30:35.117 --> 30:36.410
Did l miss it?

30:36.619 --> 30:40.206
- Yes, you did, but we didn't.
- You first.

30:40.414 --> 30:41.791
Ziva David, Mossad.

30:41.957 --> 30:45.086
She's here to stop you
from whacking Ari. Yours?

30:45.544 --> 30:48.214
Director Jenny Shepard.
Same mission.

30:48.756 --> 30:50.341
Which agency?

30:50.549 --> 30:52.093
Ours.

30:55.721 --> 30:57.139
Yeah?

30:58.265 --> 30:59.809
Special Agent Gibbs.

31:00.017 --> 31:01.519
Ziva David, Mossad.

31:01.894 --> 31:03.312
Ziva.

31:03.729 --> 31:06.023
Director Shepard
has spoken often of you.

31:06.524 --> 31:09.860
- Really?
- Ziva and l worked antiterrorist ops

31:10.027 --> 31:12.196
since 9/1 1 .
You saw one today in MTAC.

31:12.405 --> 31:13.489
That was yours?

31:14.031 --> 31:15.449
l only acquired the intel.

31:17.535 --> 31:18.828
Excuse me.

31:23.165 --> 31:27.586
Yes, l really am
the new NClS director.

31:29.422 --> 31:30.673
Yeah.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.472
Good to have you back, boss.

32:15.843 --> 32:17.219
Shalom.

32:30.816 --> 32:34.153
Miss David, whose balls get cut off

32:34.362 --> 32:37.073
if Ari is not a Mossad mole,
but a terrorist?

32:37.323 --> 32:40.868
Mine, l suppose.
Since l'm his control officer.

32:41.077 --> 32:44.038
They promote control officers
young in Mossad.

32:44.288 --> 32:47.333
Have to. The good ones are dead
at your age.

32:49.168 --> 32:52.338
Do you know
how l located Ari's terrorist cell?

32:52.505 --> 32:54.590
GPS fix off
his encrypted cell phone.

32:54.799 --> 32:56.509
He wanted you to know
the terrorists' location,

32:56.675 --> 32:58.386
so you could stop the missile
instead of him,

32:58.552 --> 33:00.012
which would've blown his cover.

33:00.179 --> 33:04.683
Only an NSA satellite
can GPS an encrypted phone.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.727
Ari didn't know l had that asset.

33:06.936 --> 33:09.230
You give him less credit
than he gives you.

33:09.438 --> 33:12.024
Who hung up first? You or him?

33:17.238 --> 33:19.865
Ari knows a fix
takes only 1 9 seconds.

33:20.032 --> 33:23.369
When Sharon visited Bush, Ari's
Hamas cell kidnapped Agent Todd.

33:24.036 --> 33:27.039
Why didn't he kill her instead of freeing
her to warn the Secret Service?

33:27.248 --> 33:29.583
Why don't you arrange
a meet and he can tell me?

33:29.834 --> 33:33.045
Ari Haswari is a Mossad
operative undercover in Hamas.

33:33.254 --> 33:36.382
He hasn't turned on us or you.
He didn't kill Agent Todd.

33:37.425 --> 33:40.344
Gibbs, even if you're right,
we owe them proof.

33:40.553 --> 33:41.637
That's all we ask.

33:41.887 --> 33:44.223
- Don't kill the wrong man.
- Like Mossad did in Norway?

33:44.432 --> 33:46.058
That mistake cost us dearly.

33:46.225 --> 33:49.395
Not as dearly
as the Palestinian waiter you killed.

33:51.397 --> 33:56.652
Ziva, assure your deputy director that
even though Ari Haswari is a suspect,

33:56.861 --> 34:00.906
no action will be taken
unless we have evidentiary proof.

34:04.368 --> 34:06.871
Proof before action.

34:35.483 --> 34:38.610
You were my sweet superhero,
Kate.

34:49.496 --> 34:51.791
You're a naughty boy, Timmy.

34:51.956 --> 34:54.668
Oh, my God. l'm becoming Tony.

35:05.930 --> 35:06.972
Wow, what?

35:11.644 --> 35:12.812
l-- l--

35:13.437 --> 35:15.940
Stop ''ah-uming,'' McGee. Spit it out.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.320
l-- l was thinking about Kate.

35:21.987 --> 35:23.656
Me too.

35:24.156 --> 35:27.368
l kind of still feel like she's here,
you know?

35:41.549 --> 35:43.884
l want you on Ziva's ass.

35:44.093 --> 35:45.761
She's not really my type, boss.

35:46.011 --> 35:48.013
- To tail her.
- l knew that.

35:48.222 --> 35:50.057
She's been in contact with Ari.

35:50.266 --> 35:53.978
That's the only way she could know
l hung up on him.

35:54.979 --> 35:57.982
- l don't want you to get pissed--
- l thought you wanted me pissed?

35:58.190 --> 36:00.860
l did. lt was kind of weird
when you were being nice.

36:01.027 --> 36:04.196
Not that you're not nice. l mean--

36:04.363 --> 36:06.532
Will you spit it out, DiNozzo?

36:06.741 --> 36:09.535
What if Ziva's right
and Ari knew you'd trace the call?

36:09.702 --> 36:11.704
Maybe he wasn't the sniper.

36:13.414 --> 36:15.374
She is right.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.545
Ari wanted me
to raid the warehouse.

36:19.712 --> 36:22.381
He set me up.
And it cost Kate her life.

36:23.382 --> 36:24.925
ls he a mole or a terrorist?

36:25.593 --> 36:28.095
Whatever works to play his game.

36:28.804 --> 36:30.765
lf Ziva leads me to Ari?

36:31.015 --> 36:33.225
Shadow him and call me.

36:33.559 --> 36:36.520
- So you can bring him in?
- Yeah. So l can bring him in

36:36.729 --> 36:38.898
to Autopsy.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.442
The FBl database
gave me six weapons

36:41.609 --> 36:44.028
whose rifling patterns
fit the bullets you recovered.

36:44.236 --> 36:45.946
l've been able to eliminate
all but three.

36:46.155 --> 36:48.574
Two SWAT weapons,
the Tango 51 and Bravo 51 .

36:48.783 --> 36:50.743
- And this--
- My old friend.

36:51.077 --> 36:54.038
A Marine M40A1 sniper rifle.

37:05.174 --> 37:07.176
lt looks sweet
the way you hold that, boss.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.470
Sweet?

37:10.262 --> 37:12.306
Yeah. lt's an expression that means--

37:12.473 --> 37:16.185
Yeah, l know what it means,
McGee.

37:16.936 --> 37:20.815
You think Ari looked sweet
when he shot Kate?

37:21.607 --> 37:22.650
Of course not, boss.

37:23.442 --> 37:27.113
My vote is for the Tango
or Bravo 51 s.

37:27.279 --> 37:29.115
What do you think, Gibbs?

37:29.281 --> 37:31.826
Your test rounds
show more gouging than Ari's.

37:32.201 --> 37:33.786
He was hand loading
and moly coating.

37:33.953 --> 37:36.455
You are so good.

37:36.664 --> 37:38.999
- ''Moly coating''?
- Yeah.

37:39.208 --> 37:41.293
Molybdenum disulfide.
lt's a lubricant.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.504
lt decreases barrel wear
and increases accuracy.

37:43.713 --> 37:46.799
McGee, run a trace
on Tango and Bravo 51 sales.

37:47.007 --> 37:48.718
Last six weeks. Tri-state area.

37:49.593 --> 37:51.470
- Check the Bravo first.
- On it, boss.

37:52.638 --> 37:54.807
Any prints on the brass?

37:55.182 --> 37:56.600
No.

37:56.809 --> 37:59.311
ls your gut telling you something?

37:59.979 --> 38:01.981
Yeah. l need coffee.

38:02.189 --> 38:05.192
No, Gibbs. Come on.

38:06.318 --> 38:08.696
This isn't just another investigation.

38:08.904 --> 38:11.532
Todd was your agent,
but Kate was my friend.

38:11.741 --> 38:14.035
So can you stop it
with the John Wayne stare

38:14.243 --> 38:17.163
- and tell me what your gut says?
- What don't l believe in, Abby?

38:17.663 --> 38:20.332
UFOs, mystics, coincidence,

38:20.541 --> 38:23.461
saying you're sorry, excuses.
l could go on all night.

38:23.669 --> 38:28.674
As a Marine sniper, l used
hand-loaded Lapua .308 boat-tail

38:28.841 --> 38:31.677
full metal jacket,
moly-coated bullets.

38:33.179 --> 38:34.513
Gibbs.

38:34.722 --> 38:37.391
You know what a sniper calls
a Bravo 51 ?

38:38.017 --> 38:39.518
No.

38:40.353 --> 38:42.146
A Kate.

39:10.299 --> 39:13.761
My shoulder hurts
when it rains, too, Gerald.

39:15.679 --> 39:17.556
Good night, Kate.

39:28.609 --> 39:29.944
<i>Autopsy.</i>

39:30.403 --> 39:31.696
Hello, Dr. Mallard.

39:31.904 --> 39:34.240
Gerald.
How are you, my dear fellow?

39:34.990 --> 39:36.242
l've been better.

39:36.409 --> 39:39.412
<i>- Oh, what's wrong?
- He's having flashbacks.</i>

39:40.121 --> 39:42.581
<i>- Well, who are you?
- Oh, l'm hurt.</i>

39:42.790 --> 39:44.583
<i>You don't recognise my voice?</i>

39:45.710 --> 39:47.253
You bastard.

39:48.963 --> 39:50.339
You do remember me.

39:50.589 --> 39:52.091
lf you harm Gerald--

39:52.258 --> 39:54.969
<i>l have no intention
of harming Gerald.</i>

39:55.219 --> 39:57.263
l think one ruined shoulder
is enough.

39:57.471 --> 39:58.764
lt certainly is for me.

39:59.765 --> 40:00.975
<i>What do you want?</i>

40:01.225 --> 40:05.229
A professional courtesy,
one doctor to another.

40:05.438 --> 40:09.108
Yes, well, l'd be most willing
to provide a free autopsy.

40:11.360 --> 40:15.948
Dr. Mallard,
l want to prove l didn't kill Caitlin.

40:16.157 --> 40:17.324
By taking Gerald hostage?

40:17.533 --> 40:20.369
<i>Gerald is free to go if you'll listen</i>

40:20.536 --> 40:23.831
<i>- to my side of this tragedy.
- l'm listening.</i>

40:24.040 --> 40:28.044
lt's a long story and l'd hate
to have somebody trace this call.

40:28.294 --> 40:29.962
<i>Well, no one is here but me.</i>

40:31.047 --> 40:32.298
And Caitlin.

40:32.506 --> 40:35.468
<i>lt must have been
a difficult autopsy for you.</i>

40:35.634 --> 40:37.386
l'm truly sorry, doctor.

40:37.636 --> 40:38.888
Will you get on with it?

40:39.138 --> 40:41.474
Will you meet me alone?

40:41.640 --> 40:42.808
What happens to Gerald?

40:43.142 --> 40:45.811
Come alone
and you can exchange places.

40:45.978 --> 40:47.521
Doctor, don't come. He'll kill you.

40:47.772 --> 40:50.816
<i>Learn to trust, Gerald.</i>

40:51.025 --> 40:54.153
l may have shot you in the shoulder.

40:54.320 --> 40:58.199
<i>But l've never lied to you. Doctor?</i>

40:58.574 --> 40:59.825
You have my word.

41:00.701 --> 41:01.786
Thank you.

41:09.085 --> 41:11.837
Re-evaluating your convictions?

41:12.380 --> 41:16.175
How many times did you tell me there's
no such thing as a coincidence?

41:18.010 --> 41:19.178
Jethro?

41:21.013 --> 41:23.933
l know it's been a difficult day
for both of us.

41:25.601 --> 41:28.062
That's what my Dl used to say.

41:29.021 --> 41:30.314
Never believed him.

41:34.527 --> 41:36.070
Jen...

41:38.864 --> 41:41.450
Are you going to dinner with CBS?

41:42.702 --> 41:44.370
l am.

41:45.913 --> 41:47.998
Don't do that interview.

41:53.212 --> 41:54.755
Please.

41:59.885 --> 42:02.346
l'll see if l can delay it a few days.

42:03.639 --> 42:05.099
Good.

42:06.100 --> 42:07.893
Good night, Jethro.

42:08.060 --> 42:09.603
Night.

42:20.865 --> 42:23.325
Ducky. How nice to see you again.

42:23.492 --> 42:25.411
And you. Congratulations.

42:25.578 --> 42:28.914
- Going home?
- Yes.

42:29.081 --> 42:30.249
Ducky.

42:39.383 --> 42:41.594
So are you back at work, Gerald?

42:42.178 --> 42:43.804
Next week.

42:44.013 --> 42:47.683
l've always found
that work is the best--

42:55.107 --> 42:57.443
A vintage Morgan.

42:57.610 --> 42:58.986
How Ducky.

42:59.820 --> 43:00.988
Flash your lights.

43:08.954 --> 43:11.040
Roll down your window.

43:14.460 --> 43:17.421
Now wait in the good doctor's car
while we talk.
