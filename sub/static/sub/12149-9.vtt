WEBVTT

00:01.929 --> 00:05.230
We fade up on an aerial
shot, Downtown skyscrapers, lights...

00:06.129 --> 00:06.830
...yadda, yadda,

00:07.330 --> 00:09.050
We hear a famous narrator...

00:09.130 --> 00:11.730
...maybe that bald Star Trek guy
or one of the Baldwins,

00:12.730 --> 00:15.609
And he says, "It's a big,
bad city out there, "

00:16.329 --> 00:19.629
Cut to a woman walking
down a dark, spooky street, alone,

00:20.530 --> 00:23.789
We'll cast some beautiful,
young actress,

00:24.129 --> 00:26.690
A starlet whose career
is on the verge of taking off,

00:27.730 --> 00:30.750
Anyway, she's all nervous, right?
Mucho vulnerable,

00:31.329 --> 00:34.740
The voice guy says,
"Danger lurks around every corner, "

00:36.729 --> 00:37.960
She's attacked by a big...

00:38.530 --> 00:39.609
...goon with a knife,

00:39.729 --> 00:41.130
She screams, "Help!

00:41.530 --> 00:43.210
Is there no one to help me?"

00:43.929 --> 00:46.350
Well, now there's someone
who'll answer your call,

00:48.130 --> 00:49.390
He'll protect you...

00:53.530 --> 00:54.719
...and catch you when you fall,

00:54.729 --> 00:56.100
You can count on it,

00:57.729 --> 01:00.359
And you can count on me,
because I'm the Dark Avenger.

01:01.929 --> 01:04.879
- I'm the what?
- The Dark Avenger.

01:06.129 --> 01:08.519
- I'm the Dark Avenger.
- I know, it's perfect.

01:09.129 --> 01:10.530
We can shoot it ourselves.

01:10.930 --> 01:13.980
I'll charm a post-production house
into doing the effects and--

01:14.530 --> 01:16.530
I know something about self-promotion.

01:16.930 --> 01:20.900
One commercial like this could help
get us out of the red, or the black...

01:21.730 --> 01:23.980
...or whichever means we're broke,
that's us.

01:25.930 --> 01:28.739
Buffy blows into town and puts
you in a permanent funk...

01:28.930 --> 01:31.980
...and I'm supposed to stand and
watch our business go belly-up?

01:33.730 --> 01:35.239
He's not entirely wrong.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.819
Advertising a superhero who
can't really go out in the daylight...

01:40.329 --> 01:41.870
...may raise vampire suspicions.

01:42.730 --> 01:43.849
Not to mention our lack...

01:43.930 --> 01:45.540
...of an investigator's license.

01:46.930 --> 01:48.959
Who needs a license
without any clients?

01:49.329 --> 01:52.069
We'll manage, princess.
We always do.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.849
We will if we project the right image.

01:56.530 --> 02:00.319
And now I am suddenly thinking
Angel's all wrong for this commercial.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.879
He's larger than life, way too
Braveheart for Joe Couch Potato...

02:05.530 --> 02:07.280
...to relate to.  We need someone...

02:07.930 --> 02:09.680
...who's average...

02:10.330 --> 02:12.930
...run of the mill, ordinary....

02:13.930 --> 02:14.870
You're perfect.

02:16.930 --> 02:19.740
- I appreciate the compliment--
- Come into the light.

02:20.530 --> 02:21.969
Let's create cheekbones, okay?

02:22.330 --> 02:24.580
I'm not photogenic,
plus I get dry mouth.

02:24.729 --> 02:27.990
Excuse me?  This is not a
negotiation, this is a necessity.

02:28.930 --> 02:32.159
Our boss is in a funk.  He's
only happy when he's fighting evil.

02:33.129 --> 02:34.500
Now let's drum up some.

02:34.930 --> 02:37.419
I don't know what we need evil for
when we got you.

02:37.930 --> 02:38.729
I heard that.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:30.050 --> 03:31.939
"If you need help,
then look no further.

03:33.050 --> 03:34.729
Angel Investigations is the best.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.860
- Our rats are low--"
- Rates!

03:39.650 --> 03:40.490
It says "rats."

03:40.849 --> 03:43.409
"Our rates are low,
but our standards are high.

03:45.050 --> 03:48.810
When the chips are down, and
you're at the end of your rope...

03:49.849 --> 03:51.360
...you need someone to count on.

03:52.250 --> 03:56.319
That's what you'll find here.
Someone who'll go all the way...

03:57.050 --> 03:58.699
...who will protect you always.

03:58.849 --> 04:00.110
So don't lose hope.

04:01.849 --> 04:03.460
Come on over to our offices...

04:03.650 --> 04:06.669
...and you'll see that there's
still heroes in this world."

04:08.449 --> 04:11.330
Is that it?  Am I done?

04:12.650 --> 04:15.669
I don't know.  I'm not
getting everyman, I'm getting...

04:16.850 --> 04:17.790
...weasel.

04:18.649 --> 04:19.629
We don't want weasel.

04:19.850 --> 04:22.449
People will pour in when
they hear about our low rats.

04:25.250 --> 04:26.509
I can try it again.

04:27.649 --> 04:28.519
I don't think so.

04:33.050 --> 04:34.660
Weasel factor, huh?

04:37.250 --> 04:39.879
I didn't mean it like that.
I'm sorry.  I'm just--

04:40.250 --> 04:44.250
I feel hopeless with him down there
doing the nonprofit brooding.

04:45.050 --> 04:46.490
It's not like he has a heart.

04:46.850 --> 04:48.040
How could it be so broken?

04:48.649 --> 04:50.860
I guess seeing Buffy
got him where he lives.

04:51.050 --> 04:53.470
That's all very sad,
but we live here too.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.410
I'll talk to him.

04:57.649 --> 04:59.399
Maybe if we get him a costume.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.050
- A costume?
- The guy's a bona fide hero.

05:03.050 --> 05:05.680
Would it kill him to wear tights
for some publicity?

05:06.050 --> 05:08.399
I don't see Angel putting on tights.

05:09.649 --> 05:11.720
Oh, now I do, and it's
really disturbing.

05:21.649 --> 05:24.879
Hey.  Is this a private catharsis
or can anyone watch?

05:25.250 --> 05:26.189
What do you want?

05:27.050 --> 05:29.819
There's a girl who's not
sad enough to cry in my arms...

05:30.649 --> 05:33.069
...but keep up the dark cloud.
I might get lucky.

05:33.649 --> 05:35.089
I just need a little time.

05:35.449 --> 05:36.360
Believe me, I know.

05:37.250 --> 05:40.759
Last time I saw my ex, she was around
for five minutes and I was a wreck.

05:41.449 --> 05:43.410
It's amazing how they can
do that to you.

05:44.449 --> 05:46.240
Buffy was here more
than five minutes.

05:47.449 --> 05:48.180
Okay.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.980
Ten, but who's counting?

05:50.449 --> 05:53.639
Actually, she was here
for a whole day and night.

05:54.050 --> 05:55.379
One of us has been drinking...

05:55.850 --> 05:57.389
...and I'm sad to say
it isn't me.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.850
Why didn't you tell me about
the Oracles, Doyle?

06:01.250 --> 06:03.389
The Oracles?
Who told you about the Oracles?

06:04.250 --> 06:06.279
The Mohra demon got away
the first time.

06:06.649 --> 06:07.629
What first time?

06:07.850 --> 06:11.220
I killed it.  Some of its blood
mixed with mine and made me mortal.

06:12.050 --> 06:14.149
That's when you took me
to see the Oracles.

06:14.449 --> 06:17.220
No, see, I'd remember a trip to
the netherworld.

06:18.050 --> 06:21.350
- It doesn't happen every day.
- They said I was released from duty.

06:22.250 --> 06:23.970
Buffy and I were together until...

06:26.449 --> 06:27.959
...we realized it couldn't be.

06:30.050 --> 06:31.699
We don't belong to ourselves.

06:33.050 --> 06:34.939
We belong in the world, fighting.

06:36.050 --> 06:37.560
So I went back to the Oracles...

06:37.850 --> 06:39.639
...and asked them to
turn back the clock...

06:40.850 --> 06:42.740
...as though that day
had never happened.

06:43.250 --> 06:46.060
Human? You were a real live
flesh and blood human being.

06:47.449 --> 06:48.459
And you and Buffy....

06:50.449 --> 06:53.930
You had the one thing you wanted in
your life and you gave it back?

06:55.850 --> 06:58.480
- Maybe I was wrong.
- Or maybe Cordelia was right.

06:59.449 --> 07:02.050
About you being the real deal
in the hero department.

07:02.449 --> 07:06.069
See, I would've chosen the pleasures
of the flesh over duty and honor.

07:07.250 --> 07:08.649
I don't have that strength.

07:09.649 --> 07:11.370
You never know till you're tested.

07:11.449 --> 07:14.149
You've lived, loved, fought
and vanquished in a day...

07:15.050 --> 07:17.610
...and I'm still trying to
ask Cordy out for dinner.

07:18.050 --> 07:20.790
Not to mention telling her
I'm half demon.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.050
That should come first, huh?

07:23.449 --> 07:26.259
They said something bad is coming.
Soldiers of Darkness...

07:27.050 --> 07:28.279
...and the End of Days.

07:28.850 --> 07:30.990
So much for long-term savings bonds.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.990
I don't know what's coming,
but I know we're part of it.

07:34.850 --> 07:37.800
If it's a fight they want,
can't someone else give it to them?

07:39.649 --> 07:42.389
It seems unfair.  You gotta
save all the helpless...

07:42.649 --> 07:44.720
...now you gotta fight
the apocalypse?

07:45.649 --> 07:46.949
It's all the same thing.

07:47.449 --> 07:50.540
Fight the good fight,
whichever way you can.

07:52.250 --> 07:55.230
Tell you what, you fight,
and I'll keep score.

07:59.290 --> 08:02.240
Angel started the day over knowing
he'd remember everything?

08:02.889 --> 08:04.329
That's pretty amazing, huh?

08:05.290 --> 08:08.129
Amazing he didn't check stock quotes
or the lotto numbers.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.639
He should've told us what happened.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.180
We can't keep secrets from each other.

08:14.290 --> 08:15.480
No, we can't.

08:21.490 --> 08:22.889
Thanks.

08:24.490 --> 08:27.509
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about secrets and whatnot.

08:28.689 --> 08:30.829
My marriage would've
stood a better chance...

08:31.689 --> 08:33.720
...if me and Harry talked more.

08:34.090 --> 08:35.558
Really let each other in.

08:37.690 --> 08:40.220
So, how is she?
You two keeping in touch?

08:40.690 --> 08:43.320
- Well, she's decided to stay in L.A.
- Oh.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.149
You'll probably be seeing
a lot of each other, then.

08:47.289 --> 08:50.480
Well, not right away.  We both
need to get on with our lives.

08:52.690 --> 08:55.740
- Getting on is good.
- If I want a lasting relationship...

08:56.289 --> 08:58.429
...I need to put a few cards
on the table.

08:59.889 --> 09:01.190
Such as?

09:02.289 --> 09:03.730
Thing of it is...

09:05.289 --> 09:07.149
...I'm a little bit more
than meets the--

09:10.690 --> 09:12.299
Oh, oh, I know this one.

09:12.490 --> 09:14.809
Mask, Mask-head.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.809
The Man With Two Brains,

09:26.889 --> 09:28.190
Whoever you saw just now...

09:29.289 --> 09:31.610
...did they look like they
could afford to pay?

10:12.289 --> 10:14.360
Pretty low-rent,
even by demon standards.

10:14.690 --> 10:17.500
You said they were hiding.
It's a good place for it.

10:35.090 --> 10:36.250
Doyle.

10:46.490 --> 10:47.960
Signs of life.

10:51.289 --> 10:52.830
I smell something.

10:55.490 --> 10:57.629
Still warm.  They left in a hurry.

10:58.490 --> 10:59.750
Not food.

11:03.289 --> 11:04.409
Fear.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.149
Don't be afraid.

11:16.490 --> 11:18.840
It's okay.  We're here to help.

11:20.090 --> 11:22.259
We gave our money to a man
for passports...

11:23.090 --> 11:24.879
...and safe passage on a ship.

11:25.490 --> 11:27.700
We didn't know.  It was stupid of us.

11:27.889 --> 11:30.519
He disappeared with our money
and the ship never came.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.279
- Where were you going?
- Briole...

11:33.889 --> 11:35.850
...a small island off
the coast of Ecuador.

11:36.289 --> 11:38.610
Others of our kind have
found sanctuary there.

11:38.690 --> 11:39.700
Sanctuary from whom?

11:41.090 --> 11:42.029
They're close.

11:42.889 --> 11:46.299
They almost got us.
We lost half our supplies.

11:47.090 --> 11:48.980
Rieff, we have a guest.

11:49.490 --> 11:51.000
It's the Promised One.

11:51.889 --> 11:53.009
Terrific.

11:57.289 --> 11:58.620
There's been a misunderstanding.

11:59.090 --> 12:01.649
I don't think so.  Many of
our prophesies are cryptic...

12:02.690 --> 12:06.019
...but one thing is clear:
In the final days of this century...

12:06.289 --> 12:08.710
...the Promised One will
save us from the Scourge.

12:11.090 --> 12:13.509
- The Scourge?
- He doesn't even know who they are.

12:14.090 --> 12:15.419
How can he protect us?

12:15.889 --> 12:17.539
They're coming!
No matter how many...

12:17.690 --> 12:20.710
...promised guys you throw at them,
they won't stop until we're dead.

12:23.690 --> 12:25.269
You're gonna get us all killed.

12:30.889 --> 12:33.210
He's young.  I'm sorry.

12:33.889 --> 12:35.220
Excuse me.

12:47.090 --> 12:50.460
We need to deal with this.
They think I'm some promised savior.

12:54.289 --> 12:54.990
What?

12:56.090 --> 12:57.279
The Scourge.

12:57.889 --> 12:58.899
You know them?

13:00.889 --> 13:02.330
What are they?

13:03.289 --> 13:04.269
Death.

13:32.129 --> 13:34.409
- Who's there?
- A friend.

13:35.129 --> 13:36.210
I don't have any.

13:36.929 --> 13:38.860
All right.
I'm more like a relative...

13:41.129 --> 13:42.710
...who needs your help.

13:44.129 --> 13:46.129
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

13:46.529 --> 13:49.019
My name is Lucas.
I'm a Brachen demon, like you.

13:50.129 --> 13:55.259
My clan has been living in the woods,
in Oregon.  Safe, until they came.

13:57.330 --> 13:59.149
Not all of us escaped.

13:59.730 --> 14:01.659
I don't know what you think I can do.

14:02.129 --> 14:03.529
I got problems of my own.

14:04.529 --> 14:07.690
They know we're here.
They're coming for us.

14:08.730 --> 14:11.190
What are you talking about?
Who's coming for you?

14:11.730 --> 14:12.740
The Scourge.

14:14.129 --> 14:15.389
Who the hell is that?

14:15.929 --> 14:18.669
An army of pure-blood demons.

14:18.929 --> 14:21.070
They hate us mixed-heritage types.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.110
Very into pedigree.

14:24.929 --> 14:26.580
They hunt us down like animals.

14:27.330 --> 14:29.330
- No one fights back?
- Sure they do.

14:29.730 --> 14:32.289
All the time.  You can kill them.

14:32.730 --> 14:34.409
They believe in what they're doing.

14:36.330 --> 14:38.009
They're ready to die for the cause.

14:38.730 --> 14:40.240
Hard to fight fanatics.

14:41.129 --> 14:43.480
- More like impossible.
- I'm not asking you to fight...

14:43.529 --> 14:46.580
- ...just help us hide for a while.
- You got the wrong guy, pal.

14:47.730 --> 14:50.639
Want to set up a little off-track
betting?  I got the know-how.

14:51.330 --> 14:53.960
But demon-hiding?  It's not my line.

14:54.330 --> 14:55.799
- You're one of us.
- No, I'm not.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.700
I was raised human.

14:59.129 --> 15:00.879
I'm not looking to explore me roots.

15:02.129 --> 15:03.879
We don't have anyone else to turn to.

15:06.330 --> 15:07.909
I don't know what to tell you.

15:08.129 --> 15:09.850
You're up against something big.

15:10.529 --> 15:13.649
Anybody that helps you,
they're taking a chance.

15:14.129 --> 15:17.850
And I'm not, you know,
dying to take chances.

15:18.929 --> 15:22.649
Doyle, if you don't believe
we share a common family...

15:23.730 --> 15:25.690
...believe we share a common enemy.

15:26.730 --> 15:28.799
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

15:32.730 --> 15:34.129
Guess not.

15:41.730 --> 15:42.710
I punked out,

15:42.929 --> 15:45.980
I just found out about my demon side.
I didn't know what it meant.

15:47.129 --> 15:51.059
The idea of sudden obligations with
guys that looked like pincushions...

15:51.929 --> 15:53.960
...was a little too much
to take then.

15:54.330 --> 15:55.559
Then what happened?

16:12.929 --> 16:14.159
Damn it.

16:24.929 --> 16:26.960
Believe we share a common enemy,

16:31.529 --> 16:34.090
When I got the visions
I thought it was a stroke,

16:35.730 --> 16:37.690
I didn't know what the images meant.

16:38.129 --> 16:40.090
But I had to know if it was a dream...

16:41.730 --> 16:42.889
...or real,

17:26.730 --> 17:28.200
It wasn't a dream,

17:33.329 --> 17:36.420
- You couldn't have known.
- They need more than a Promised One.

17:38.130 --> 17:41.319
The contractually obligated
500 might be a start.

17:41.730 --> 17:43.730
You can't fight the Scourge, Angel.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.400
It won't come to that,
because we'll get them out.

17:56.369 --> 17:57.529
Hello?

18:05.369 --> 18:06.490
Angel?

18:08.369 --> 18:09.240
Hello.

18:11.369 --> 18:14.670
While this may look like a
popular brand of breath freshener...

18:14.970 --> 18:17.529
...it's really a cunningly disguised
demon repellent.

18:20.970 --> 18:22.789
- Wintergreen.
- Cordy, it's okay.

18:23.369 --> 18:24.740
We're here to help them.

18:26.369 --> 18:27.700
Oh.  Hi.

18:30.569 --> 18:33.130
- Where's Angel?
- Securing documents for safe passage.

18:33.569 --> 18:35.849
- Did you get the truck?
- Yes, it's out front.

18:37.170 --> 18:39.940
Hey, Doyle, you did notice
that these folks are demons?

18:40.170 --> 18:42.980
Yeah, I know that.
It doesn't make them bad people.

18:44.970 --> 18:46.410
Excuse us a sec?

18:47.970 --> 18:51.799
Okay, mission statement check.
We battle the forces of darkness.

18:52.769 --> 18:55.509
They're half-human
and they're in trouble.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.109
We don't have time.
Angel wants you to go to the harbor.

18:59.369 --> 19:01.400
Pier 12, slip four, The Quintessa,

19:02.369 --> 19:05.069
Use Angel's name,
he knows the captain.

19:05.369 --> 19:08.180
- So we're booking them on a cruise?
- Basically, yeah.

19:10.170 --> 19:12.420
- I guess not Carnival.
- He runs a freighter.

19:12.569 --> 19:15.269
He owes Angel some money.
He does this, they're even.

19:16.170 --> 19:18.130
Hang on. This guy owes Angel money?

19:18.569 --> 19:22.190
- Why aren't we collecting it?
- Cordy, oppressed demon people here.

19:22.769 --> 19:23.819
Not getting safer.

19:24.569 --> 19:27.339
- So we pay to send them on a cruise?
- Please.

19:28.769 --> 19:29.640
Just do it.

19:30.569 --> 19:33.200
We need to know the ship is ready
before we can move.

19:34.769 --> 19:36.519
Bad things are coming, aren't they?

19:38.369 --> 19:40.089
Very bad things.

19:41.970 --> 19:44.000
- I'm on it.
- Call me the minute it's done.

19:44.369 --> 19:45.170
Okay.

19:49.170 --> 19:52.579
- I can get into trouble doing this.
- Not as much as if you don't.

19:53.369 --> 19:56.319
I look the other way on some
of Randy's shipments...

19:56.970 --> 19:59.500
...because he's my brother,
not because of the money.

20:00.569 --> 20:01.619
Family's important.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.509
- So you're not going to pay?
- I'm not paying.

20:05.369 --> 20:08.700
- It's extortion.
- Big Randy told you about me, right?

20:08.970 --> 20:10.859
- He said you bit him.
- I never bit him.

20:12.569 --> 20:14.009
- So you don't--
- I wasn't hungry.

20:16.170 --> 20:18.240
- What should the documents say?
- The ship...

20:19.170 --> 20:21.099
...is carrying a cargo
of medical waste.

20:21.569 --> 20:24.480
No one looks inside or tries
to stop it from leaving port.

20:25.170 --> 20:28.259
If they do, I'm gonna be feeling
it's your fault.

20:30.569 --> 20:33.029
Then look for me to get
a little bit peckish.

20:40.170 --> 20:41.180
Have a nice trip.

20:44.609 --> 20:47.839
We don't have time for this.
What's wrong with that boy?

20:48.809 --> 20:51.720
- What is it?
- Rieff.  He took off.

20:52.410 --> 20:53.920
He does this every time.

20:54.210 --> 20:55.220
He'll be back.

20:56.009 --> 20:57.380
No, he won't.

20:59.609 --> 21:01.750
He says there isn't any Promised One.

21:02.609 --> 21:05.700
And he wasn't gonna stay here
and get killed with the rest of us.

21:07.410 --> 21:09.940
- We're not gonna get killed, are we?
- No.

21:10.410 --> 21:11.710
No one's gonna get killed.

21:13.410 --> 21:14.920
Clear out when Cordelia calls.

21:15.809 --> 21:18.789
Go to the ship.  If you're not here,
I'll take the boy there.

21:21.809 --> 21:22.509
Hey.

21:24.809 --> 21:26.109
Do you know where he went?

21:32.609 --> 21:34.079
Rieff, wait!

21:35.009 --> 21:36.480
Wait!

21:38.609 --> 21:40.470
- You're fast.
- I'm walking.

21:41.609 --> 21:44.309
- You're just old.
- Yeah, okay.

21:46.410 --> 21:48.509
We ought to go.  Angel's got a ship.

21:48.809 --> 21:52.500
Great. Have fun.
Take some Dramamine.

21:53.609 --> 21:55.710
- You're not coming with?
- You can't make me.

21:56.009 --> 21:58.539
You're right.  You're old enough.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.869
It's your choice.

22:01.410 --> 22:03.579
Right, a choice.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.200
Where do I want to be hated?

22:06.809 --> 22:08.109
You wouldn't get it.

22:08.609 --> 22:10.750
You're passing. My mother
was the same way.

22:11.009 --> 22:12.589
Could walk down the streets.

22:13.410 --> 22:15.829
She took me out with her one day.
I was so excited.

22:16.410 --> 22:18.269
In the neighborhood
with the other kids.

22:19.410 --> 22:20.809
You know what day it was?

22:23.009 --> 22:24.170
What day was it?

22:29.009 --> 22:30.170
It was Halloween.

22:30.809 --> 22:32.809
So that's my choice.

22:33.809 --> 22:36.269
I can be hated by humans
because they're scared...

22:37.410 --> 22:40.009
...or by pure-bloods
who want to kill me.

22:40.410 --> 22:42.299
It's so easy, it's not
much of a choice.

22:42.809 --> 22:45.160
Seems your family's one
place you know you belong.

22:45.809 --> 22:46.789
Hey.

22:47.609 --> 22:50.869
- Bet that little girl will miss you.
- Yeah, well, she's dead by now.

22:53.609 --> 22:54.940
Or might as well be.

22:55.410 --> 22:57.299
They're coming again, I can feel it.

22:58.410 --> 22:59.990
- It's different this time.
- Why?

23:00.210 --> 23:02.029
Because of the Promised One?

23:06.809 --> 23:09.720
- So you know it's not true.
- No, I don't.

23:10.410 --> 23:12.869
I don't know about your people's
myths and legends...

23:13.410 --> 23:16.250
...but I do know Angel,
and he's the genuine article.

23:17.009 --> 23:19.220
- A hero.
- Yeah, that's exactly what he is.

23:19.410 --> 23:22.529
They can call him whatever they like.
What does it matter?

23:23.609 --> 23:25.779
It matters because it's a lie.

23:26.609 --> 23:30.650
They put their faith in something.
You don't have to if you don't want.

23:32.009 --> 23:34.039
Maybe Angel doesn't know
what he's doing.

23:35.609 --> 23:39.019
But the other option, losing
yourself, hoping it all goes away...

23:39.809 --> 23:42.089
...I know that never works.

23:44.609 --> 23:46.539
How about we go find your family?

23:50.609 --> 23:53.000
Well, it's not exactly
The Love Boat, is it?

23:53.609 --> 23:55.539
Sorry, we haul cargo, not people.

23:56.009 --> 23:58.710
- It's never complained.
- We can bring in some blankets.

23:59.009 --> 24:00.240
How many are we talking?

24:01.410 --> 24:04.079
Maybe 20.  Some are short people,
you know, children.

24:04.410 --> 24:07.670
It won't be too comfortable but
we'll get them where they're going.

24:09.809 --> 24:11.140
We'll take it.

24:14.609 --> 24:16.680
- Hey, this way.
- Huh?

24:17.009 --> 24:19.329
I thought all Brachens
had good sense of direction.

24:20.009 --> 24:22.150
Yeah, we're all pretty good at
basketball too.

24:24.809 --> 24:25.819
What?

24:29.609 --> 24:30.450
They're here.

24:41.009 --> 24:41.849
Come on, let's go.

24:53.289 --> 24:54.269
Go!

24:55.690 --> 24:56.670
In there.

25:00.490 --> 25:01.190
Check up there!

25:08.890 --> 25:10.119
Sit tight.

25:20.289 --> 25:21.660
Destroy it all!

25:23.890 --> 25:24.900
Doyle.

25:27.490 --> 25:28.750
Stay here.

25:28.690 --> 25:29.420
You understand?

25:40.690 --> 25:41.990
- Get him!
- There!  Go, go!

25:42.490 --> 25:43.750
Here's one!

25:44.289 --> 25:45.480
Kill him!

25:59.890 --> 26:02.029
Take your squad on
the east side, move!

26:02.289 --> 26:03.589
They're coming.

26:05.890 --> 26:07.049
Good.

26:14.890 --> 26:17.630
They were here, sir.  Recently.

26:17.890 --> 26:21.539
And when the lights come on,
where do the vermin go?

26:34.089 --> 26:35.980
- Keep looking.
- For what?

26:36.490 --> 26:37.289
This?

26:38.289 --> 26:40.609
Back off, it's my kill.

26:43.089 --> 26:45.230
Vampires don't feed on demon blood.

26:45.490 --> 26:48.299
Please.  I wouldn't eat this.
He reeks of humanity.

26:49.089 --> 26:50.599
You're one to talk, vampire.

26:50.890 --> 26:52.750
Yours is the lowest
of all half-breeds.

26:53.289 --> 26:54.730
You think I don't know that?

26:55.089 --> 26:58.500
You think I don't smell the humanity
inside me, day and night...

26:59.289 --> 27:00.829
- ...polluting me?
- Please don't!

27:01.690 --> 27:02.490
Shut up!

27:04.690 --> 27:08.059
A half-breed who murders other
half-breeds.  Always charming.

27:09.490 --> 27:11.519
I know who you are.
I want to join you.

27:12.490 --> 27:15.089
Join us?  You wish to die?

27:15.490 --> 27:18.509
I need to be cleansed,
and only you can show me the way.

27:19.089 --> 27:21.509
Kill me if you want,
you'd only be freeing me.

27:22.089 --> 27:24.930
I can kill half-breeds for you.
I do it faster and better...

27:25.690 --> 27:26.880
...than anyone you've got.

27:27.490 --> 27:30.019
I know their minds, where they hide...

27:30.490 --> 27:32.029
...what they think.

27:32.890 --> 27:34.329
I can help you.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.529
Maybe you can.

27:47.289 --> 27:49.680
Bring him!  Take him
to area one, now!  Move!

27:50.890 --> 27:52.430
Faster!  Come on!

28:19.650 --> 28:21.789
I think I hated that plan.

28:36.450 --> 28:37.990
Can all Brachen demons do that?

28:38.849 --> 28:40.710
We're stronger in demon form.

28:41.849 --> 28:43.779
But I generally prefer
to pass as human.

28:46.049 --> 28:47.490
Where is everyone?

28:47.849 --> 28:49.849
Where they're supposed to be,
I hope.

28:50.849 --> 28:53.200
Look, I got my clearance.
We have to go now.

28:53.250 --> 28:55.849
- I've got a schedule to keep.
- They'll be here.

28:56.849 --> 28:58.150
Just a few more minutes.

28:58.650 --> 29:01.349
Angel said he'd cut half my debt
for this favor, right?

29:01.650 --> 29:05.130
Yep.  Half.  That's what he said.
Big whopping 50 percent.

29:05.849 --> 29:08.099
- Quite a deal.
- He takes 60 percent off...

29:08.849 --> 29:09.549
...then I wait.

29:10.650 --> 29:12.369
You drive a hard bargain.

29:16.049 --> 29:19.140
We can't thank you enough.
I'm sure Rieff's in safe hands.

29:19.650 --> 29:21.720
- Doyle will get him here.
- He's a good one.

29:22.650 --> 29:24.160
He understands our suffering.

29:25.049 --> 29:26.130
We both do.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.180
I didn't mean to say
that you didn't.

29:28.650 --> 29:30.440
It's just more familiar for Doyle.

29:31.049 --> 29:34.839
He has to live with persecution.
You always do when you're half demon.

29:37.049 --> 29:38.240
Demon?

29:40.930 --> 29:42.400
The other day, I was asked:

29:42.730 --> 29:45.119
Why hunt the mongrel?

29:45.730 --> 29:49.519
Doesn't its very inferiority
guarantee that it poses no threat?

29:50.529 --> 29:54.640
Won't it die of its own innate,
mortal stupidity?

29:55.930 --> 29:57.369
Let me tell you...

29:57.730 --> 30:01.630
...even the smallest of vermin
need be addressed.

30:02.529 --> 30:06.180
Half-breeds.  Worse.
They keep cross-breeding...

30:06.730 --> 30:09.470
...forever diluting our precious
demon blood...

30:10.329 --> 30:12.259
...with their weak,
simpering humanity.

30:13.329 --> 30:15.190
If we allow this to happen...

30:15.730 --> 30:18.329
...it's like giving up
the call to evil altogether.

30:19.329 --> 30:21.789
It's as good as turning human
ourselves.

30:22.930 --> 30:25.000
Well, I say never!

30:25.329 --> 30:27.119
I say, we will not stop...

30:27.730 --> 30:29.660
...until every half-breed
is erased...

30:30.130 --> 30:32.380
...and our purity rules this planet!

30:33.130 --> 30:37.700
We will not stop because
the higher order demands it!

30:38.529 --> 30:41.720
Now, this very evening...

30:42.130 --> 30:45.039
...we take a giant step
towards our goal.

30:45.730 --> 30:48.220
Tonight, the half-breeds
that have eluded us...

30:48.730 --> 30:50.450
...will be destroyed.

30:51.130 --> 30:53.829
And we know how to find them
thanks to this good man.

30:54.730 --> 30:57.329
First mate on a ship
they think means salvation...

30:57.730 --> 30:59.519
...not annihilation.

31:00.130 --> 31:03.539
He comes to us for money,
but he is a brother to our cause.

31:04.329 --> 31:06.220
And we invite him...

31:06.730 --> 31:08.660
...to witness the power of the beacon.

31:19.329 --> 31:21.750
Tonight, the Lister half-breeds....

31:22.329 --> 31:24.079
Incredible, isn't he?

31:24.730 --> 31:27.849
- He makes it all so clear.
- Yes.

31:28.329 --> 31:30.579
- Things are very clear.
- The Listers...

31:31.329 --> 31:33.960
...along with any creatures
contaminated with human blood...

31:34.329 --> 31:37.700
...will perish the moment this
cleansing light touches them.

31:39.730 --> 31:41.900
When it achieves full power
and detonates...

31:42.730 --> 31:46.519
...its deadly reach will extend
a quarter mile in every direction.

31:48.730 --> 31:50.240
Want to see how it works?

31:59.529 --> 32:02.650
A fitting end for a sorry mutation.

32:04.930 --> 32:07.460
Go now!  And deliver this,
our message!

32:08.529 --> 32:10.529
Our victory depends on it!

32:43.930 --> 32:45.190
Someone's coming!

32:51.130 --> 32:53.940
Do you know what you put us through?
We gotta get out of here.

32:54.730 --> 32:57.190
- I'm sorry.
- Let's get you down with the others.

32:58.329 --> 32:59.200
Thanks.

33:02.529 --> 33:04.529
- What?
- You're alive.

33:05.529 --> 33:06.759
And you're not happy?

33:08.529 --> 33:09.690
We were worried.

33:10.930 --> 33:12.750
Oh.  Well, it's all gonna be okay--

33:16.930 --> 33:17.799
What was that for?

33:18.130 --> 33:20.200
Why didn't you tell me
you were half demon?

33:20.529 --> 33:22.880
I thought we agreed
that secrets are bad.

33:26.529 --> 33:27.859
I wanted to tell you.

33:28.329 --> 33:29.309
I was afraid.

33:30.730 --> 33:34.309
- I thought if I did, you'd reject me.
- I've rejected you way before now.

33:35.529 --> 33:37.779
So you're half demon.  Big whoop.

33:38.529 --> 33:40.880
I can't believe you think
I'd care about that.

33:42.130 --> 33:44.299
I work for a vampire.  Hello!

33:44.529 --> 33:47.200
- It's true.  I just--
- Do you think I'm superficial?

33:49.329 --> 33:51.119
Being half demon is
far down the list.

33:51.730 --> 33:55.029
Way under short and poor.

33:57.130 --> 33:58.710
Anything else I should know?

34:00.730 --> 34:03.009
No, the half demon thing
is my big secret.

34:05.529 --> 34:06.579
Good.

34:06.730 --> 34:09.219
That's out.  It's done.

34:09.730 --> 34:12.050
Would you ask me out
for dinner already?

34:14.530 --> 34:15.760
Yeah?

34:17.530 --> 34:18.789
Cordelia...

34:21.730 --> 34:23.268
- ...would you like to--
- It's Angel.

34:28.929 --> 34:30.610
- We have to go now.
- What's going on?

34:31.329 --> 34:33.500
- I can't find my first mate.
- Go to the bridge.

34:33.730 --> 34:34.500
They're here.

34:36.730 --> 34:38.980
- Angel.
- Get below. Lock the doors.

34:40.929 --> 34:42.369
- But--
- Move! Now!

34:42.730 --> 34:44.130
Stay with the others.

34:50.530 --> 34:51.969
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

34:53.530 --> 34:55.389
Lock the hatches!
The Scourge is here!

34:55.929 --> 34:58.320
We're shoving off,
we're gonna make it.

35:08.530 --> 35:10.780
You lied to us, half-breed.

35:11.530 --> 35:13.699
You catch on quick, football-head.

35:15.730 --> 35:16.670
Kill him.

35:16.929 --> 35:17.800
Painfully.

36:00.130 --> 36:01.070
It's gonna detonate.

36:01.329 --> 36:03.500
Get out!  Everyone out!  Now!

36:10.329 --> 36:13.139
Welcome to a cleaner world.
Soon, only the pure...

36:13.329 --> 36:15.119
...will be left standing.

36:15.730 --> 36:16.960
Actually, pure boy...

36:17.530 --> 36:18.829
...you'll be on your ass.

36:21.809 --> 36:23.880
Locked from the outside,
we're trapped!

36:36.210 --> 36:38.099
- What's this?
- Kills anything with human blood.

36:39.210 --> 36:41.769
It's getting brighter
and that little doohickey's....

36:42.809 --> 36:44.139
It's fully armed, isn't it?

36:44.610 --> 36:45.480
Almost.

36:45.809 --> 36:47.630
I think I can still pull the cables.

36:48.210 --> 36:49.750
Without touching the light?

36:51.210 --> 36:53.489
- It's suicide.
- There's gotta be another way.

36:57.809 --> 36:59.280
- It's all right.
- No!

37:07.409 --> 37:09.159
The good fight, yeah?

37:11.610 --> 37:13.679
You never know until
you've been tested.

37:16.409 --> 37:17.530
I get that now.

37:47.010 --> 37:48.869
Too bad we'll never know...

37:51.809 --> 37:53.949
...if this is a face
you could learn to love.

38:03.809 --> 38:05.000
Doyle.

38:05.610 --> 38:06.449
Doyle.

38:06.809 --> 38:07.539
Doyle!

38:08.610 --> 38:09.769
Doyle!

38:10.409 --> 38:11.530
No!

38:20.610 --> 38:21.449
No!

39:16.289 --> 39:19.940
If you need help,
then look no further,

39:21.090 --> 39:23.230
Angel Investigations is the best,

39:24.090 --> 39:25.320
- Our rats are low--
- Rates!

39:27.090 --> 39:27.789
It says "rats, "

39:30.090 --> 39:33.179
Our rates are low,
but our standards are high,

39:34.289 --> 39:36.110
When the chips are down...

39:37.289 --> 39:39.110
...and you're at the end
of your rope...

39:39.690 --> 39:41.409
...you need someone to count on,

39:42.090 --> 39:45.670
That's what you'll find here,
Someone who'll go all the way...

39:46.289 --> 39:49.130
... who will protect you
no matter what,

39:51.690 --> 39:53.340
Come on over to our offices...

39:53.489 --> 39:56.469
...and you'll see that there's
still heroes in this world,

40:06.090 --> 40:07.280
Is that it?

40:07.889 --> 40:09.010
Am I done?
