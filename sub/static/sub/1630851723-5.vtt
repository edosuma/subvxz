WEBVTT

00:02.970 --> 00:04.838
<i>Stan, you need to
get here as fast as you can.</i>

00:04.972 --> 00:06.774
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

00:06.907 --> 00:08.976
Look, for all we know,
CID already has him
in custody.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.645
Yeah? Then why haven't
we heard from Nitesh
or Maryanne?

00:11.779 --> 00:14.282
I don't know, but I'm sure
there's a logical explanation.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.650
<i>There were ambulances
at the CID safehouse!</i>

00:16.784 --> 00:18.752
<i>Just sit tight.
I'll be at the motel soon.</i>

00:18.886 --> 00:19.853
We'll talk to...

00:19.987 --> 00:20.721
...Hans.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.126
No.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.461
It can't be.

00:27.595 --> 00:28.729
<i>Can't be
what, Stan?</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:29.963
It can't be what?

00:30.098 --> 00:31.765
Him. He's here.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.834
<i>Oh, my God.
Stan, you have to
get out of there.</i>

00:40.941 --> 00:42.576
<i>Stan? Are you there?</i>

00:42.710 --> 00:43.711
<i>Stan?</i>

00:52.620 --> 00:53.487
Stan?

00:54.322 --> 00:55.489
Stan?

01:25.018 --> 01:26.387
I'm just saying,
I don't understand.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.455
That may be what
you're saying,

01:27.588 --> 01:28.589
but the way
you're saying it

01:28.722 --> 01:30.158
sounds like
you don't trust me.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.827
Then let me start over.

01:33.961 --> 01:36.096
I love you,
and whatever this is...

01:36.230 --> 01:38.666
This is cancer.
Maybe.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.735
That's why you got
the blood test,
to get a second opinion.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.538
What I don't understand
is why the Bureau
wouldn't let you

01:44.672 --> 01:46.207
give the oncologist
the drug test.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.276
I don't know.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.843
I know you're
an amazing instructor,

01:49.977 --> 01:52.546
but would our
national security
really be at risk

01:52.680 --> 01:54.815
if someone else
trained the cadets?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.685
What can I say?
I'm that good.

02:05.559 --> 02:06.660
When you stopped
being a field agent,

02:06.794 --> 02:07.895
I thought
you were safe.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.563
Now this?

02:11.432 --> 02:12.833
I wish I could
protect you.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.134
You do.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.569
In every way
that matters.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.278
Hey.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.579
I do trust you.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.499
I'm here
to see Raymond.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.238
He said
it was urgent.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.606
Raymond is troubled.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.576
Some man
and his airfields.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.711
Jovan Lovic?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.913
Raymond wanted to meet.

03:00.047 --> 03:01.849
The man refused
because of you.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.485
Me?

03:07.588 --> 03:09.022
I didn't do this
to hurt him.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.994
Dembe.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.830
The Havana Syndrome...
What do you know about it?

03:16.964 --> 03:18.499
It's a series
of ailments...

03:19.933 --> 03:24.004
Headaches, fatigue,
vertigo, blurred vision...

03:24.137 --> 03:26.974
First reported by
American diplomats
in Cuba,

03:27.107 --> 03:30.411
and later by U.S. personnel
in embassies around the world.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.313
Mysterious ailments
caused by

03:32.446 --> 03:33.881
a mysterious weapon.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.016
A directed-energy
weapon.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.151
Mmm. Mierce,
those are delicious.

03:38.286 --> 03:39.753
You are a wonder.

03:39.887 --> 03:43.357
I can't imagine a life
without either of them.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.861
Mystery weapon.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.830
Do you know how
to locate one?

03:49.963 --> 03:52.433
I know that one has
recently gone missing,

03:52.566 --> 03:55.603
one that this country
and this country's enemies

03:55.736 --> 03:57.671
would dearly love to
get their hands on.

03:57.805 --> 04:00.107
I thought the weapons
were made by our enemies.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.975
Yes, well, in
the Yankee Doodle spirit of

04:02.109 --> 04:04.678
"any way you can kill,
I can kill better,"

04:04.812 --> 04:07.681
the Americans transformed
Cuba's pea-shooter model

04:07.815 --> 04:10.217
into a particularly
fearsome iteration

04:10.351 --> 04:11.919
that has the potential
to usher in

04:12.052 --> 04:14.688
a brutal new form
of guerrilla warfare.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.591
About Jovan Lovic...

04:17.725 --> 04:19.092
Lovic is
my problem.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.695
The problem you
should focus on is
finding this weapon.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.700
These weapons can
disable people

04:26.834 --> 04:28.702
by sending highly powered
energy waves

04:28.836 --> 04:31.805
through walls, floors,
ceilings without detection.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.441
According to Raymond,

04:33.574 --> 04:35.776
the Pentagon responded to
the energy weapon attacks

04:35.909 --> 04:38.479
by tasking DARPA to
design one of their own,

04:38.612 --> 04:41.281
which they did,
only for the chief
engineer to disappear

04:41.415 --> 04:42.816
along with
the prototype.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.852
The chief engineer...
What do we know about him?

04:44.985 --> 04:47.721
His name is
Dr. Benjamin Okara.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.290
He immigrated to the U.S.
from Lagos when he was ten.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.026
Agent Park,
welcome to the party.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.029
Sorry. I got in my car
and ended up at the academy.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.598
Habit, I guess.

04:57.731 --> 05:01.301
Okara has a Ph.D.
in electrical
engineering from MIT,

05:01.435 --> 05:03.704
where he won the somewhat
unusual distinction

05:03.837 --> 05:06.273
of being the only
summa cum laude graduate

05:06.407 --> 05:08.108
to have been suspended
four times.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.644
Apparently, the last one was
for assembling a Zamboni

05:10.778 --> 05:12.646
in the faculty dining hall.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.583
AI-enabled target processing,
hypersonic missile defense.

05:15.716 --> 05:16.917
Okara has quite
the resume.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.319
But did Reddington say
why he went rogue?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.855
<i>Only that the
weapon can fetch a fortune
on the black market,</i>

05:21.989 --> 05:23.957
<i>but it's equally possible
he's been turned.</i>

05:24.091 --> 05:25.158
<i>We just don't know.</i>

05:25.292 --> 05:26.694
We may not know
his motives,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.796
but we can certainly
find out about
the weapon he stole.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.297
Park, Ressler,
get over to DARPA.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.999
We need to know what
this thing is capable of.

05:35.603 --> 05:36.837
What are you
doing here?

05:36.970 --> 05:38.572
You sound
like Peter.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.108
Oh, so you told him?
Good.
Of course I told him.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.310
And then I proceeded
to lie to him about
how I found out

05:43.444 --> 05:45.479
and why I couldn't
give the oncologist
my drug test.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.781
Well, because it was
my test using your urine.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.483
Which, if you hadn't
given me,

05:49.617 --> 05:50.584
you wouldn't have known
something was wrong,

05:50.718 --> 05:52.786
so, uh,
you're welcome.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.394
Agents Ressler
and Park are here.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.795
Please,
come in.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.631
Your office called to say
you were on your way over.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.065
Then you know
why we're here.
I do.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.700
And as I told
the gentleman
I spoke with,

06:06.834 --> 06:08.902
I can't comment on
classified projects.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.504
We know about
the directed-energy
weapon,

06:10.638 --> 06:12.339
that Okara supervised
its development,

06:12.473 --> 06:14.508
that he's taken the prototype
and gone who knows where.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.844
We were kind of hoping you
were the "who" who knows.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.514
I am sorry, but I can't
confirm or deny

06:20.648 --> 06:22.816
even the existence
of classified projects.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.418
What about the scientists
who work on them?

06:24.552 --> 06:25.886
<i>Can you tell us who else
worked on the project</i>

06:26.019 --> 06:27.421
<i>you can't
tell us about?</i>

06:27.555 --> 06:29.990
<i>Or if the military
has at least begun
an investigation?</i>

06:30.123 --> 06:32.025
I wish I could,
but as I'm sure
you can appreciate,

06:32.159 --> 06:34.795
I can't even speculate about
personnel or investigations

06:34.928 --> 06:37.531
that may or may
not be connected
to classified projects

06:37.665 --> 06:38.932
that may or may not exist.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.701
You know what
isn't speculative?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.470
That a powerful weapon
is missing,

06:42.603 --> 06:44.204
that in the wrong hands,
it could do incredible damage,

06:44.337 --> 06:46.173
and that you're too busy
covering your own ass

06:46.306 --> 06:48.408
to help us prevent that
from happening.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.377
I'm late for a meeting.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.612
Alison will
show you out.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.651
DARPA is investigating.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.587
I'm sorry?

06:59.720 --> 07:01.755
The project's secret,
and they don't
want any leaks,

07:01.889 --> 07:04.658
but Director Reiss has
been on the phone
with investigators

07:04.792 --> 07:06.226
every day for
the last week.

07:06.359 --> 07:07.761
There were five scientists
on Okara's team.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.196
Were?

07:09.329 --> 07:11.398
Stan Rogers was killed
in a car crash
yesterday morning.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.066
What about
the other scientists?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.035
No one knows.
It's like they
all disappeared.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.704
The whole team
is missing?

07:16.837 --> 07:18.405
We need their names...
Everyone on the team.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.272
Can you do that?

07:22.843 --> 07:24.545
Hans! Listen,
Stan's missing.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.246
<i>Desert. Ash. Beware.</i>

07:36.323 --> 07:37.457
Oh, my God.

08:06.587 --> 08:09.056
The ballistics match
the ones from
the homicide report

08:09.189 --> 08:10.724
and from
my service weapon.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.926
Honey, it doesn't mean
that you did it.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.863
The bullet that
shot Doug Koster
came from my gun.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.098
It's been over
eight years.
He's in our past.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.333
What... One night,
you get drunk
and you kill him?

08:20.467 --> 08:22.636
I went to the precinct.
I was gonna confess.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.237
But I can't remember
what happened.

08:24.371 --> 08:25.172
<i>I wish you had.</i>

08:25.806 --> 08:26.840
Turned myself in?

08:26.974 --> 08:28.308
Told the truth.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.211
If you don't and they
find the ballistics,

08:31.344 --> 08:33.013
no one's gonna believe
that you're innocent.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.317
Oh, sorry.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.486
We, uh, have an update
on the scientists.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.453
I'll be right down.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.597
I sent a blood sample
to the lab to find out
if I was drugged.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.698
When will you get
the results?

08:50.831 --> 08:52.666
A week.
Maybe more.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.301
Until then, I'm not
admitting to anything.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.336
If the police find out,
I just...

08:56.469 --> 08:57.805
<i>A friend ran the ballistics
on my weapon.</i>

08:57.938 --> 08:59.573
No one else knows,
and no one's gonna know.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.141
We have a lot of things
to worry about,

09:01.274 --> 09:03.310
but the police finding out
about my involvement

09:03.443 --> 09:04.945
isn't one of them.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.880
I'll talk to you later.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.481
First, the scientists.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.951
Olivia Martinez,
Nitesh Shah,
Maryanne Sims,

09:11.084 --> 09:12.986
Hans Fielder,
and Stan Rogers.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.121
All of them
worked for Okara,

09:14.254 --> 09:16.389
and as of yesterday,
all are missing.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.391
Next, cause of death.

09:18.525 --> 09:19.993
The radiologist
who examined Rogers

09:20.127 --> 09:21.962
says that his brain
damage is worse

09:22.095 --> 09:23.563
than what he suffered
in the crash.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.399
Meaning Okara may have used
the prototype on Rogers.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.501
Why would
Okara do that?

09:28.636 --> 09:30.237
Use it on one
of his colleagues?

09:30.370 --> 09:32.740
If his goal was to sell it,
that makes no sense.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.174
These scientists are
the only other people

09:34.307 --> 09:35.508
who know how
the device works.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.044
If he gets rid of them,
he secures

09:37.177 --> 09:39.412
exclusive access
to the technology
for his buyer.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.014
And provides
a demonstration

09:41.148 --> 09:42.683
of the technology's
capabilities.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.584
Okay, guys,

09:44.718 --> 09:46.553
I just hung up
with Olivia
Martinez's husband,

09:46.687 --> 09:48.756
and he spoke to
her last night,
and she was scared.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.824
All she'd say is that
she was at a motel

09:50.958 --> 09:51.925
waiting to meet
one of her colleagues,

09:52.059 --> 09:53.393
so I back-tracked
the call,

09:53.526 --> 09:55.095
and her burner
pinged a tower
in South East

09:55.228 --> 09:57.597
that covers 30
square blocks
with two motels.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.399
One is closed
for renovations,

09:59.532 --> 10:02.035
and the other is the Oak Leaf
on Rhode Island and 6th.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.615
Jovan,
this is an easy deal to make.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.217
You have
my old airfields.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.887
I have business that
requires access to them.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.390
Now, I'm told you have
some concerns,
so let me assure you,

10:23.523 --> 10:25.959
this sudden conversion
of a former colleague of mine

10:26.093 --> 10:28.261
will absolutely not
interfere with

10:28.395 --> 10:30.597
an otherwise
profitable collaboration.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.365
He converted to
a federal agent.

10:32.499 --> 10:33.967
Yes, and as a result,

10:34.101 --> 10:36.870
has been entirely cut off
from my operations,

10:37.004 --> 10:38.972
my accounts,
my whereabouts,

10:39.106 --> 10:41.074
and all the people
I do business with.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.910
So you say.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.878
But how can we be sure
you're still not in contact?

10:45.012 --> 10:46.780
I am
still in contact.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.149
Believe me, having him
at an arm's length

10:49.282 --> 10:51.618
is better than having him
sneak up behind me.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.386
He will not be
a problem.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.288
We need to be sure.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.657
Killing him
would be sure.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.427
Killing an FBI agent,
under any circumstances,

11:00.560 --> 11:02.095
is proof of
only one thing...

11:02.229 --> 11:03.596
Stupidity.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.699
Killing an agent who
was a former associate

11:05.833 --> 11:07.935
is both stupid
and bad business.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.603
They'd only assign even more
than the usual number

11:10.738 --> 11:12.305
of buzzcuts
to find me,

11:12.439 --> 11:14.441
which might very
well jeopardize
our collaboration.

11:14.574 --> 11:17.177
So, unless there are any other
helpful suggestions...

11:17.310 --> 11:18.511
Are you
calling me stupid?

11:20.280 --> 11:21.849
Though I'm not sure
the idiom translates.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.183
So, yes.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.619
Cute as a button,
isn't she?

11:26.754 --> 11:28.055
You should see what
she does with a chicken.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.023
Wrings it, bleeds it,
and plucks it

11:30.157 --> 11:31.759
before it ever knows
it was dead.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.065
Do you have a proposal?

11:38.198 --> 11:40.333
In exchange for access
to the airfields,

11:40.467 --> 11:42.502
I'll settle your dispute
with Jilal,

11:42.635 --> 11:45.705
guarantee safe passage
for your product
through Panama,

11:45.839 --> 11:47.841
and secure a place
for your granddaughter

11:47.975 --> 11:49.843
in Brearley's
kindergarten class.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.544
Run the numbers.
I think you'll find

11:51.678 --> 11:53.713
your organization's
profits will soar,

11:53.847 --> 11:56.616
to say nothing of Desanka's
block-building skills.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.486
I will consider it.

11:59.619 --> 12:02.322
While you do,
consider this...

12:02.455 --> 12:05.325
Dembe Zuma
is my responsibility.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.929
If anything is to be done,
good or bad,

12:09.062 --> 12:10.530
I will be the one
doing it.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.436
You know I lied about
my drug test

12:16.569 --> 12:18.738
to hide an addiction
that I'm trying to break?

12:18.872 --> 12:20.707
I'm not proud of it,

12:20.841 --> 12:23.877
but there is a certain
amount of twisted
internal logic.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.913
But what you're doing...

12:26.046 --> 12:27.180
There's no logic
to it at all.

12:28.681 --> 12:31.118
You tell Peter about
the diagnosis,
but not the job.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.154
You tell Cooper
about the job,
but not the diagnosis.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.589
Except for me,
you're hiding something
from everyone.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.691
What makes you think
I'm not hiding
something from you?

12:38.826 --> 12:39.960
Because there's only
so many deceptions

12:40.093 --> 12:41.594
you can squeeze
into one day.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.164
I'm not deceiving you.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.433
I'm just holding back.

12:47.667 --> 12:48.635
What?

12:49.536 --> 12:51.404
The flood gates.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.874
What do you mean,
like tears?

12:55.909 --> 12:57.577
Men. Honestly.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.265
FBI! Olivia,
can you hear me?

13:19.099 --> 13:20.233
Are you in there?

13:30.077 --> 13:31.244
She's dead.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.218
911 operator.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.786
This is Agent Park
with the FBI.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.688
I need local police to
respond to my location.

14:01.808 --> 14:03.443
Sir, you've got
a call on one.

14:03.576 --> 14:04.777
Patched through
from Hoover.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.279
Anything from the motel?

14:07.915 --> 14:09.216
We were too late.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.985
Olivia Martinez is dead,
the desk manager
is badly injured,

14:12.119 --> 14:13.786
and Okara is gone.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.755
I want to see Park and Ressler
as soon as they get back.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.027
Harold Cooper.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.995
<i>Yeah, hi. This is Detective
Marcus Heber, MPD.</i>

14:23.130 --> 14:24.597
Detective,
how can I help you?

14:24.731 --> 14:26.033
<i>I was hoping I could
ask you a few questions.</i>

14:26.166 --> 14:28.301
Oh? What about?

14:28.435 --> 14:29.569
<i>The murder
of Doug Koster.</i>

14:37.810 --> 14:39.446
There's one dead
and four injured.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.814
Martinez in room 29
and the guests
in room 28 and 30,

14:41.949 --> 14:43.316
plus the manager.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.517
We don't have
a cause of death,

14:44.651 --> 14:46.019
but the victim's symptoms
are consistent

14:46.153 --> 14:47.454
with what we know
about directed energy.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.022
Okara must have
aimed at Martinez

14:49.156 --> 14:50.490
and the others suffered
peripheral damage.

14:50.623 --> 14:51.925
Significant,
but not fatal.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.426
We're pulling CCTV.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.295
Once we get it,
we'll compare it
to what we have

14:55.428 --> 14:57.530
from the area where
Okara's first victim
was found.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.599
Still no cooperation
from DARPA?
None.

14:59.732 --> 15:00.867
The Pentagon
locked down
the scene,

15:01.001 --> 15:03.236
sent in
CID investigators.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.072
There was a notepad
in the room.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.674
The top page was blank,
but it had markings,

15:07.807 --> 15:11.078
so we traced them
and came up with some
kind of a code,

15:11.211 --> 15:13.546
something Martinez
may have written down.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.283
There's three words.
"Desert," "ash," "beware."

15:16.416 --> 15:18.751
Now, the forward slashes
made us think that
it was a website,

15:18.885 --> 15:20.954
but all we got were
a list of movies

15:21.088 --> 15:22.555
to beware of watching
on a desert island.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.926
It's not a website.
It's an app.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.428
Do you know
what it means?

15:28.561 --> 15:32.565
Not yet, but the app
is called WordWorld3,

15:32.699 --> 15:35.268
and it is a way to
communicate locations

15:35.402 --> 15:38.305
by converting GPS coordinates
into three-word addresses.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.240
"Desert, ash, beware"
is a place.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.674
The app divides
the world

15:41.808 --> 15:44.211
into 57 trillion
9-meter squares,

15:44.344 --> 15:46.746
that is trillion
with a "T."

15:46.879 --> 15:51.018
And this one is
at 4453 Wentworth Ave.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.486
Olivia Martinez's
husband said
she was scared

15:53.620 --> 15:55.122
and looking for
a place to hide.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.556
She didn't get there,
but, uh,

15:56.689 --> 15:57.757
maybe some of
her colleagues did.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.560
Sir?

16:00.693 --> 16:02.662
Right. Uh,
Wentworth Avenue.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.464
Park, Agent Zuma,
see what you can find.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.872
Detective,
thanks for coming.

16:13.740 --> 16:14.874
Let's talk
in my office.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.213
That's gonna be good.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.982
A...

16:33.160 --> 16:34.194
That's a gun in
your back.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.398
In case
you're wondering,

16:38.531 --> 16:40.433
on the off chance
you're capable
of wonder,

16:41.634 --> 16:43.970
I have eyes in
the back of my head.

16:44.104 --> 16:48.441
I don't draw a breath
without knowing
my perimeter is secure.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.444
It's why
I'm still alive,

16:51.578 --> 16:53.946
and it's why
we made you
about an hour ago.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.450
So, why are you here?

16:58.318 --> 17:00.353
Is it Dembe,

17:00.487 --> 17:03.090
or does Jovan think
I'm angling for

17:03.223 --> 17:06.159
his used-to-be-mine
airfields?

17:06.293 --> 17:09.296
Or is this about me
calling you stupid,

17:09.429 --> 17:12.065
which under
the circumstances,
I think you'll agree

17:12.199 --> 17:13.800
was
a gross understatement.

17:13.933 --> 17:14.901
Go to hell.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.304
Someday.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.472
Weecha, it's time to
feed the armadillo.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.610
After you.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.478
We've actually
met before.

17:25.612 --> 17:26.813
Outside Koster's house.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.248
Yes. The morning after.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.349
You said that you were
there to see

17:29.482 --> 17:31.017
what the commotion
was about.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.885
Seemed to me like
there was a little
more to that story,

17:33.019 --> 17:34.554
so I, uh, jotted down
your plate number.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.956
Imagine my surprise to
learn that you're FBI,

17:37.090 --> 17:39.726
and someone I gotta
sign an NDA just
to get in to see.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.228
You're obviously doing
something important here,

17:41.361 --> 17:43.430
so I don't want
to take up too
much of your time.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.032
Doug was my neighbor
for many years.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.667
When I heard he'd
been killed, I...
I couldn't believe it,

17:47.800 --> 17:50.002
so I drove by to see
what was going on.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.504
You and Mr. Koster
were close?

17:52.372 --> 17:53.706
Not particularly.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.077
Doug and my wife had
an affair years ago.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.581
Though I suspect
you already know that.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.516
Mr. Koster's body was found
in the doorway.

18:04.351 --> 18:05.818
No sign of forced entry.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.587
Seemed like he knew
the person that shot him.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.656
I wasn't fond of the man.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.691
I also wasn't anywhere near
his house the night he died.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.261
I was at a retirement
party at the Tap Room

18:14.394 --> 18:15.728
on U Street.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.131
ME's report has time
of death between

18:18.265 --> 18:19.899
3:00 and 5:00 a.m.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.668
That's pretty late
for a retirement party.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.070
I left around 11:00
and went straight home.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.238
Was anyone there?

18:25.372 --> 18:26.906
At home?

18:27.039 --> 18:28.708
It's not an alibi.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.076
It's the truth.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.444
I'm sure it is.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.213
But you know how
this works.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.549
I was with my wife.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.450
Olivia?

19:12.285 --> 19:13.753
Olivia, is that you?

19:17.056 --> 19:18.491
Drop the gun!
Put the gun down!

19:18.625 --> 19:19.992
Drop the gun!
Put it down!

19:25.232 --> 19:27.133
We're FBI agents.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.236
Hans, right?
Hans Fielder?

19:29.369 --> 19:30.670
How did you find me?

19:30.803 --> 19:32.772
Desert, ash, beware.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.342
We found a message
in Olivia's motel room.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.277
You saw her?
Is she all right?

19:38.278 --> 19:39.612
Olivia is dead.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.650
Please,
we're here to help.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.652
I'm sorry, but, uh,
is everything all right?

19:45.785 --> 19:47.720
It's fine.
Good, because,
I mean,

19:47.854 --> 19:49.322
I didn't know
if the officer
was here

19:49.456 --> 19:50.623
about Charlene's
friends.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.725
The footage.
Tell me.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.861
Right, okay.
So, a blue van
was in both.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.264
The plates are bogus,
and the registration
is to a P.O. box.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.531
Pull the financials
on the box,

19:58.665 --> 20:00.199
put out an APB
on the van.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.901
If we find it,
we find Okara.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.337
Ben was our friend.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.738
He knew more
than anyone

20:05.872 --> 20:06.973
why this weapon
should never be used.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.875
It was used against
him in Cuba.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.178
He worked in
the Havana embassy?

20:12.312 --> 20:14.547
<i>He was sent there
to study the effects
of the weapon.</i>

20:14.681 --> 20:16.683
<i>When he got back,
he had them, too.</i>

20:16.816 --> 20:19.552
<i>Tremors, light sensitivity,
headaches.</i>

20:19.686 --> 20:21.020
<i>So, he comes back
to DARPA to build</i>

20:21.153 --> 20:23.089
<i>an even more powerful
weapon, steals it,</i>

20:23.222 --> 20:25.625
<i>and then turns it on
his colleagues you
say he cares about?</i>

20:25.758 --> 20:27.460
<i>He did more
than steal it.</i>

20:27.594 --> 20:29.496
<i>He wiped our research
from the database.</i>

20:29.629 --> 20:31.664
Even if DARPA wanted
to rebuild it,
they wouldn't know how.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.033
And the wire?

20:34.166 --> 20:36.369
We also found this
in Olivia's motel room.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.538
We thought metal would
absorb the energy

20:38.671 --> 20:41.007
and act as an early
warning system.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.242
When it glows,
we'd know an attack
was about to begin.

20:45.878 --> 20:48.047
It's Aram.
I'll take it outside.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.717
Here's what's
gonna happen...

20:50.850 --> 20:51.951
We're gonna take you in,
keep you safe.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.886
Not until
I find the others.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.756
I won't leave
Nitesh and Maryanne.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.325
He found
Stan and Olivia.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.692
I can't let him
find them.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.494
To prevent that,
you need to help us,

21:01.628 --> 21:02.862
and that starts by
letting us take you in.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.096
It's not safe here.

21:05.498 --> 21:06.766
Okay.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.234
Can I grab my phone?

21:08.368 --> 21:10.102
We found Hans Fielder.

21:10.236 --> 21:13.105
He needs protection,
a safehouse
until this is over.

21:13.239 --> 21:15.107
<i>I'll make
the arrangements.
Here's what we know.</i>

21:16.576 --> 21:18.077
All right.
I'm ready.

21:32.158 --> 21:33.225
Dembe!

21:36.963 --> 21:38.064
Oh!

22:14.534 --> 22:15.968
A blue van at both scenes.

22:25.812 --> 22:26.979
Alina!

22:34.320 --> 22:35.121
Alina,
don't move.

22:38.425 --> 22:39.859
This is Dembe Zuma.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.360
I need a level-two
activation

22:41.494 --> 22:43.329
in Madison, Virginia.
Code echo-Charlie-one.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.031
<i>That code's
no longer valid.</i>

22:45.164 --> 22:46.799
Herbert,
you know me.
<i>I need a valid code.</i>

22:46.933 --> 22:48.801
Damn it, Herbert,
send the helicopter now!

22:50.837 --> 22:52.371
<i>Chopper inbound,
ten minutes.</i>

23:01.514 --> 23:03.983
I told you,
I wrote it all down.

23:04.116 --> 23:07.520
Teddy's recovering from
a valve replacement
in Rochester.

23:07.654 --> 23:08.988
Edna's with
him there,

23:09.121 --> 23:12.091
so she asked
if their son Geoffrey
could fill in.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.560
I'll remember
the nipples.
I swear!

23:13.693 --> 23:15.027
No, don't get Dad.
It's okay.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.731
Edna?
It's Raymond.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.800
Yes.
Uh, listen,

23:20.933 --> 23:23.736
uh, Geoffrey
will be fine,
so, please,

23:23.870 --> 23:27.239
wish Teddy a <i>refuah shlema</i>
and leave the boy alone.

23:27.373 --> 23:28.775
Thank you, Edna.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.176
Why no armadillo?

23:30.309 --> 23:31.878
Dad says
I'm not ready
for mammals.

23:32.011 --> 23:34.146
Well, I'm sure
the shellfish
will suffice.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.515
Can we get you
anything else?

23:38.818 --> 23:40.052
I forgot
the cracks and picks.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.688
Easy peasy.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.357
And maybe some bibs
and butter, to be safe?

23:45.492 --> 23:46.726
Lemon squeezy.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.427
He's in the back.

23:49.662 --> 23:50.863
Yes?

23:52.865 --> 23:54.166
Say that again.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.677
Raymond.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.846
You're in
or you're out.
You can't be both.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.180
It's one or the other.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.249
Emergency transport
was too far.

24:10.382 --> 24:11.751
In or out.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.252
If I had not
called Herbert...

24:13.385 --> 24:15.387
<i>Herbert has been
let go.</i>

24:15.522 --> 24:18.257
Because he helped me
give Alina a chance?

24:18.390 --> 24:19.792
We still don't know
the extent of the damage.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.193
<i>I understand,</i>

24:21.327 --> 24:22.862
<i>and I hope Agent Park
makes a full recovery,</i>

24:22.995 --> 24:25.798
but perhaps I didn't explain
the extent of the problem

24:25.932 --> 24:28.601
you joining the FBI
has caused.

24:28.735 --> 24:30.002
<i>My association
with the FBI</i>

24:30.136 --> 24:32.171
has always been
difficult to conceal,

24:32.304 --> 24:35.041
but you being an agent makes
it nearly impossible

24:35.174 --> 24:39.445
unless you and I strictly
adhere to the rules.

24:39.579 --> 24:42.248
If I do anything to
assist you in a way

24:42.381 --> 24:44.250
that involves other
people from my world,

24:44.383 --> 24:46.185
it could be
fatal to me.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.621
Despite our recent
unpleasantness,

24:48.755 --> 24:50.623
I would hope that would be
sufficient enough

24:50.757 --> 24:52.391
to stay your hand.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.033
Harold.
<i>Agent Park
owes you her life.</i>

25:01.167 --> 25:02.334
So I'm told.

25:02.468 --> 25:05.471
We traced the registration
on a P.O. box Okara uses

25:05.605 --> 25:06.939
to an offshore account.

25:07.073 --> 25:09.075
In the days since
he stole the prototype,

25:09.208 --> 25:11.343
Okara has used the account
to make multiple payments

25:11.477 --> 25:14.313
to a Constantine's
Meats and Cheeses.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.148
Ah! Sherwin.

25:16.282 --> 25:17.349
Sherwin?

25:17.483 --> 25:19.118
Sherwin Ellis.
He's Constantine.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.887
He is? A man
named Sherwin?

25:21.020 --> 25:23.089
<i>He's in the safe
haven business...</i>

25:23.222 --> 25:26.859
...rental spaces that are off
the books and under the radar.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.527
Eh, yours,
but certainly not mine.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.532
I'm sorry. I was in
the middle of something.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.367
He called me.
The detective.

25:35.501 --> 25:37.770
I know. I left you
a message he would.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.505
<i>I told you
to tell the truth.</i>

25:39.639 --> 25:41.674
I said if you didn't
and the police found out,

25:41.808 --> 25:42.975
they're not gonna
believe you.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.478
I know.
Maybe I should have.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.315
Maybe? You're a cop.

25:49.448 --> 25:50.650
<i>Yeah, and maybe
that's why I didn't.</i>

25:50.783 --> 25:52.819
I know how cops think.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.955
If it walks like a duck
and quacks like a duck,
why look any further?

25:56.088 --> 25:59.558
Well, now they're looking
at me to confirm your alibi,

25:59.692 --> 26:01.761
<i>which we both know
is a lie.</i>

26:01.894 --> 26:03.562
Harold, I love you.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.397
You're the most honest man
that I know,

26:05.531 --> 26:08.367
but you need to tell me
if that's what you want...

26:08.500 --> 26:09.702
<i>For me to lie
to the police.</i>

26:10.436 --> 26:11.871
Is that what you want?

26:15.207 --> 26:17.276
Yes. It is.

26:24.450 --> 26:25.752
Sherwin!

26:25.885 --> 26:26.819
Thank you for coming.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.154
My pleasure, Red.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.488
Crackers, picks,
butter, and bib?

26:29.622 --> 26:31.023
Yep.
Great.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.193
Please have a seat.

26:34.661 --> 26:35.795
Ah.

26:37.563 --> 26:39.265
I understand
business is good.

26:39.398 --> 26:41.768
I asked you here
because I want to
make it even better.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.836
I didn't know you were
in a position to do that.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.738
You mean
my sabbatical?

26:45.872 --> 26:47.373
That's over
for the time being.

26:47.506 --> 26:49.876
I'm back and looking to
find a client of yours.

26:50.009 --> 26:50.977
I have his
offshore account.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.544
You can use it
to trace his name.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.881
You give me his whereabouts,
and I'll give...

26:55.014 --> 26:56.415
Well, we should discuss
what I give you.

26:56.548 --> 26:59.051
Well, I appreciate that,
and if this was two years ago,

26:59.185 --> 27:00.419
I wouldn't hesitate,

27:01.587 --> 27:04.791
but in our business,

27:04.924 --> 27:07.760
people don't really come
back from sabbaticals...

27:07.894 --> 27:09.628
Not with any clout,
anyway.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.065
Perhaps this will
convince you otherwise.

27:16.568 --> 27:17.770
You work with
the Skinner?

27:17.904 --> 27:19.906
No. I am
the Skinner.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.174
A venture which
will require
the use of facilities

27:22.308 --> 27:24.643
around the globe,
perhaps your facilities.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.615
All I need from you
is an address.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.751
Reddington got
an address on Okara

27:32.752 --> 27:33.820
to a facility
he's been renting,

27:33.953 --> 27:35.287
a machine shop
in Newport News.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.423
2804 Hazelton Road.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.859
I'll reach out,
get a tac team
to meet us on site.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.660
Any update
on Agent Park?

27:41.794 --> 27:44.063
Well, she's conscious,
but it's still not clear

27:44.196 --> 27:45.932
whether there's gonna be
any lasting effects.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.800
Seems like she was
out of the direct line
of fire, though.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.836
Thank God.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.170
I want you to
monitor her progress.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.504
Did you speak to
her husband?

27:52.638 --> 27:54.106
I told him there
had been an accident.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.842
He's on his way to
the hospital now, but, uh,

27:55.975 --> 27:57.810
as far as he knows,
Park still works
at Quantico.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.679
I tried telling her.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.949
Secrets aren't healthy
and won't keep,

28:03.082 --> 28:04.316
but it's easy
to give advice.

28:04.450 --> 28:05.718
It's a lot harder
to take it.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.092
He talked.

28:13.225 --> 28:16.028
Turns out his sweet
spot was right
between the toes.

28:16.162 --> 28:18.097
If you don't mind,
I told Mom I'd call
as soon as

28:18.230 --> 28:19.766
we were done, so...
His assignment...
What was it?

28:19.899 --> 28:22.034
His boss wants to
know what to make
of you and Dembe.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.469
Well, I don't care
what he makes of me.

28:23.602 --> 28:25.037
What does he make
of Dembe?

28:25.171 --> 28:27.673
He thinks that he's a fed,
that he knows too much.

28:27.807 --> 28:28.941
So Jovan
has ordered a hit?

28:29.075 --> 28:30.109
He knows
it's happening,

28:30.242 --> 28:32.044
but he didn't know
when or where.

28:32.178 --> 28:34.013
I used Mom's go-to
just to make sure.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.315
Well, thank you,
Geoffrey.

28:36.448 --> 28:37.716
I'm sure your parents
will be very proud.

28:43.655 --> 28:45.992
You said there
are rules.
I know.

28:46.125 --> 28:46.893
And that
if you veer
from them...

28:47.026 --> 28:48.027
I know what I said.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.229
If you tried
to assist Dembe,

28:50.362 --> 28:52.664
it could be
fatal to you.

28:52.799 --> 28:55.902
It could be, but if I don't,
it will be fatal to Dembe.

28:56.035 --> 28:57.904
My job is
to protect you.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.972
I can't do that if you
won't protect yourself.

29:01.273 --> 29:05.211
You can't sacrifice
yourself for him.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.179
In the past, yes,
but not today.

29:07.814 --> 29:09.181
He was in.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.183
Now he's out.

29:11.984 --> 29:13.719
This is the
consequence,

29:13.853 --> 29:15.054
and you have
to accept it.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.468
There's the van.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.837
The van.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.507
Hands! Hands!
Show me your hands.

29:36.909 --> 29:38.911
Keep your hands
where I can
see them, all right?

29:39.045 --> 29:40.079
I'm gonna open
the door, okay?

29:40.212 --> 29:41.713
That's it.
Just the door.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.917
I suggest you
get your people

29:45.051 --> 29:46.118
to the other side
of the building.

29:48.087 --> 29:49.621
You don't want
to do this.

29:49.755 --> 29:51.223
No. I don't.

29:51.858 --> 29:54.160
But I have to.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.795
I make weapons.
I know how they work.

29:56.929 --> 29:57.930
The blast radius.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.231
I am very precise.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.101
You need to get back.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.245
I understand this
is a sensitive topic.

30:15.481 --> 30:19.085
You want to know
if I think my husband
murdered my ex-lover?

30:19.218 --> 30:21.553
Yes, Detective,
I'd say it's quite
sensitive.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.191
How did your husband
find out that, uh,

30:25.324 --> 30:26.792
you and Mr. Koster
were involved?

30:26.926 --> 30:28.627
I told him.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.430
The affair had been over
for a while, but, uh,

30:31.563 --> 30:33.399
I couldn't keep it
a secret any longer.

30:33.532 --> 30:35.801
And did he express anger
towards Mr. Koster?

30:35.935 --> 30:37.336
Of course he did.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.238
Wouldn't you?

30:39.371 --> 30:41.273
On the night of the 24th,
your husband said

30:41.407 --> 30:42.608
that he was at
a retirement party.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.543
That's right.

30:44.676 --> 30:45.777
What time
did he come home?

30:45.912 --> 30:47.846
I love my husband,

30:47.980 --> 30:49.348
but I won't
lie for him.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.151
He knows that.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.356
We did
what you asked.
Now get out of the van.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.662
Good.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.297
This is good.
Thank you.

31:06.933 --> 31:09.035
How can we help you?
What do you need?

31:09.168 --> 31:12.204
How can we resolve
this without anyone
else getting hurt?

31:12.338 --> 31:13.372
I don't want
to hurt anyone.

31:13.505 --> 31:16.842
What about Hans?
Olivia? Stan?

31:16.976 --> 31:18.144
You don't understand.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.346
No, we don't,
so help us.

31:20.479 --> 31:21.813
Why are you killing
your colleagues?

31:21.948 --> 31:23.482
Why would you
do that?

31:23.615 --> 31:25.117
They knew
how to build it.

31:25.251 --> 31:27.153
You wanted to be
the only one who could?

31:27.286 --> 31:30.689
So you could sell this weapon
and your ability to build it?

31:30.822 --> 31:32.992
Sell it? Is that
what you think I want?

31:33.125 --> 31:35.227
You really don't understand.

31:35.361 --> 31:38.064
Is it in the van?
The device?

31:38.197 --> 31:39.398
You want to see it,
don't you?

31:39.531 --> 31:40.899
'Cause it's like
a magic trick.

31:42.301 --> 31:44.370
A weapon that
goes through walls.

31:44.503 --> 31:45.737
A tool of repression
so powerful that,

31:45.871 --> 31:47.539
with the push
of a button,

31:47.673 --> 31:49.942
thousands of protestors
wouldn't be able to remember

31:50.076 --> 31:51.643
how to tie their shoes,

31:51.777 --> 31:54.046
let alone what
they'd been protesting.

31:54.180 --> 31:56.182
And like any good trick,
you don't just want to see it.

31:58.384 --> 32:02.121
You want to know how it works
so you can do it yourself.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.024
So this country can build
a thousand just like it,

32:06.058 --> 32:07.726
a weapon not of
mass destruction,

32:07.859 --> 32:08.927
but of mass...

32:10.496 --> 32:11.730
...suffering.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.366
And I can't
let that happen.

32:15.901 --> 32:17.136
You want to destroy it.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.771
The magic trick

32:19.905 --> 32:21.873
and the six people who
know how to build it.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.409
Six?

32:25.411 --> 32:30.449
I killed five people
I loved to protect
thousands I don't.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.619
And you're the sixth.

32:33.752 --> 32:35.554
Someone else is
gonna figure it out,

32:35.687 --> 32:37.389
how to make
what you did.

32:37.523 --> 32:39.391
You know you can't stop
that from happening.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.860
It's more than you
can see, the pain.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.597
It's in my head,

32:45.731 --> 32:48.600
my joints, my eyes.

32:52.704 --> 32:56.742
No, I can't stop it
from being rebuilt,

32:56.875 --> 32:59.411
but if I bought the world
a year or two or five,

33:00.446 --> 33:01.447
that's something.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.319
It's up to you
to do the rest.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.547
<i>There has
been no contact?</i>

33:35.681 --> 33:37.349
<i>Nothing between
Reddington and Zuma?</i>

33:37.483 --> 33:39.985
He hasn't been
out of my sight.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.154
Then he and I can
do business.

33:44.756 --> 33:46.592
What about Zuma?

33:46.725 --> 33:49.195
<i>I called in
a few favors,
found where he lives.</i>

33:49.328 --> 33:52.030
<i>What happens when
Reddington finds out?</i>

33:52.164 --> 33:55.867
He will thank me for
doing what he knows
he should have.

34:00.106 --> 34:01.507
Thank you.
You did well.

34:34.973 --> 34:37.008
I didn't adhere
to our rules.

34:37.143 --> 34:39.511
I violated them
for you.

34:39.645 --> 34:41.913
Now I need you to
violate them again for me.

34:48.987 --> 34:50.356
There.

34:50.489 --> 34:51.890
From the weapon
you won't confirm or deny.

34:52.023 --> 34:53.859
A weapon that was used
to kill two scientists

34:53.992 --> 34:55.694
before we even spoke,
but that, thanks
to your cover-up,

34:55.827 --> 34:57.196
was used to kill
four more.

34:57.329 --> 34:58.797
It's okay.
It's fine.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.032
Whatever this is,
it's beyond your purview.

35:01.167 --> 35:02.634
Six people are dead.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.903
This country is in
a constant state
of war, Agent Ressler.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.405
It may not be declared,
but it's being fought,

35:06.538 --> 35:08.440
by the Pentagon,
not the FBI.

35:08.574 --> 35:11.042
Six people are dead,
and my partner's
in the ICU.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.178
I'm sorry
to hear that.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.512
Not as sorry as you
are to lose

35:13.645 --> 35:15.013
the technology
that built that.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.751
True story...

35:19.885 --> 35:22.053
Calculus was discovered
independently

35:22.188 --> 35:23.589
by Newton and Leibniz.

35:23.722 --> 35:26.124
A great leap forward
imagined simultaneously.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.827
In my experience, great
leaps forward usually are.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.630
There's someone else.

35:33.031 --> 35:34.166
You have another team.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.735
You've got another team
working on directed energy.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.204
So, Okara was Newton,

35:38.337 --> 35:40.306
but Leibniz...
He's still working on it.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.908
All that,
everything Okara did...

35:43.041 --> 35:45.577
You're not gonna miss
a beat, are you?

35:45.711 --> 35:48.113
I cannot confirm or deny
even the existence

35:48.247 --> 35:49.581
of classified projects.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.456
Sakiya and Fudo
are on their way.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.960
Jovan came for you
because you're
a federal agent.

36:02.093 --> 36:03.995
He'll come for me
because I protected you.

36:04.129 --> 36:05.497
How will he know?

36:05.631 --> 36:07.733
One dead,
he may misread.

36:07.866 --> 36:10.436
Two dead, the tea leaves
will clearly indicate

36:10.569 --> 36:13.572
that you and I are
still in cahoots.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.907
Ah.

36:16.041 --> 36:17.309
Maybe we actually are.

36:19.077 --> 36:20.846
I almost
opened it
after Brasilia.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.216
I don't know why
I didn't.

36:26.084 --> 36:27.453
Our past, I suppose.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.621
Not our future.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.227
You said you wanted
something in return.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.028
You did this for me.

36:37.162 --> 36:38.964
What do you expect me
to do for you?

36:39.097 --> 36:41.467
No more, no less.
An eye for an eye.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.436
Jovan.

36:44.570 --> 36:48.440
He knows about us,
or he's about to find out.

36:48.574 --> 36:49.975
I killed Sima to
protect you.

36:50.108 --> 36:52.010
I want you to kill
Jovan to protect me.

36:52.143 --> 36:53.945
I can't do that.

36:54.079 --> 36:55.647
So, you're in
when it suits you

36:55.781 --> 36:57.849
and you're out
when it doesn't?

36:57.983 --> 37:00.151
Why does it have to be
one way or the other?

37:01.787 --> 37:03.154
Why can't it just be?

37:05.156 --> 37:07.025
My old friend knew
the answer to that.

37:12.298 --> 37:14.032
Hey.
Hey.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.634
How ya feeling?

37:15.767 --> 37:18.970
Like a sledgehammer's
taken up residence
in my cerebral cortex.

37:20.138 --> 37:21.540
Donald Ressler.
We spoke on the phone.

37:22.173 --> 37:22.874
Yeah. We did.

37:23.709 --> 37:24.743
So you told him?

37:24.876 --> 37:27.045
Yeah, she told me.
Well, I'm glad.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.247
Great.
That's great.

37:29.748 --> 37:30.749
Peter.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.586
I'll be outside.
It was good to meet you.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.890
Hey, Doc.
Been checking your DSM
on how to treat wounds

37:39.024 --> 37:40.626
from a directed-energy
weapon?

37:40.759 --> 37:42.328
You do posesomething of a challenge,

37:42.461 --> 37:43.729
but we'll get to that.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.731
We have other things
to discuss,
like your blood test.

37:47.566 --> 37:49.435
<i>I spoke to
your wife.</i>

37:49.568 --> 37:51.036
<i>She backed up
your alibi.</i>

37:51.169 --> 37:53.905
As I said,
it's not an alibi.
It's the truth.

37:54.039 --> 37:56.808
<i>Well, whatever it is,
she backed you up,
so we're good.</i>

37:56.942 --> 37:58.877
<i>No hard feelings?</i>
None.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.379
You were just
doing your job.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.280
Take care.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.886
My blood test?
My GP sent it over?

38:08.019 --> 38:09.921
She did.
I just got the results.

38:10.055 --> 38:13.559
Elevated levels of HCG
were detected,

38:13.692 --> 38:15.427
which explains why
you weren't feeling well.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.697
So, it is cancer?

38:18.830 --> 38:22.300
Elevated HCG can
indicate testicular
cancer in men, but...

38:22.434 --> 38:24.102
So, you're saying
she doesn't have cancer?

38:24.235 --> 38:26.104
No. She most definitely
does not.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.741
What it means is,
you were pregnant.

38:30.776 --> 38:33.244
Oh, my God.
What, pregnant?

38:34.746 --> 38:36.147
Honey.

38:36.281 --> 38:37.416
You said "were"?

38:38.083 --> 38:39.418
Yes. I did.

38:41.219 --> 38:43.121
<i>** Nosebleed</i>

38:44.723 --> 38:47.125
<i>** Woke up in a Black dream **</i>

38:49.027 --> 38:55.066
<i>** Flying at warp speed
In my mind</i>

38:55.867 --> 38:57.836
<i>** Oh, my</i>

38:57.969 --> 39:01.373
<i>** Who's she</i>

39:01.507 --> 39:04.843
<i>** Naked in the sweetgrass?</i>

39:05.644 --> 39:06.712
Thank you.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.314
<i>** Got the dust in my sheets</i>

39:10.015 --> 39:13.151
<i>** Who am I?</i>

39:13.284 --> 39:17.489
<i>** Who are we living for?</i>

39:17.623 --> 39:20.158
<i>** Who are we living for?</i>

39:20.291 --> 39:22.794
<i>Assalamu alaikum
wa rahmatullah.</i>

39:23.995 --> 39:26.164
<i>Assalamu alaikum
wa rahmatullah.</i>

39:27.265 --> 39:28.634
Vasko?

39:28.767 --> 39:30.502
<i>** Shake me to the core</i>

39:32.137 --> 39:34.640
<i>** Who are we living for?</i>

39:34.773 --> 39:38.176
<i>** Who are we living for?</i>

39:39.511 --> 39:40.579
Milos?

39:40.712 --> 39:41.813
<i>** Tell me who holds the key</i>

39:43.281 --> 39:44.550
<i>** Nobody seems to know</i>

39:46.752 --> 39:47.986
Yeah?

39:48.119 --> 39:49.120
It's done.

39:49.254 --> 39:50.489
<i>** Who are we living for?</i>

39:50.622 --> 39:51.823
Come home, Weecha.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.158
<i>** Who are we living for?</i>

39:56.528 --> 39:59.364
<i>** Driving me crazy</i>

39:59.498 --> 40:03.401
<i>** Shake me to the core</i>

40:04.470 --> 40:08.339
<i>** Who are we living for?</i>

40:08.474 --> 40:11.577
<i>** Who are we living for?</i>

40:11.710 --> 40:13.745
I want you
to keep that box,

40:13.879 --> 40:15.413
and on the day
you decide to leave...

40:15.547 --> 40:17.348
I'm not going to leave.

40:17.483 --> 40:18.550
But you can.

40:18.684 --> 40:20.586
<i>** Nobody seems to know</i>

40:20.719 --> 40:22.053
<i>** Who are we living for?</i>

40:22.187 --> 40:24.022
At any point of
your own choosing,

40:24.155 --> 40:25.491
I'll insist
that you do.

40:25.624 --> 40:27.859
No questions asked,
no debts accrued.

40:28.794 --> 40:30.662
Whether that's today
or tomorrow

40:30.796 --> 40:32.631
or ten years from now,

40:32.764 --> 40:34.566
that's when
you open the box.

40:34.700 --> 40:37.035
<i>** Nobody seems to know</i>

40:37.168 --> 40:42.440
<i>** Why we're lost
Inside dark matter</i>

40:42.574 --> 40:43.742
<i>** Dark matter</i>

40:43.875 --> 40:46.044
<i>** Mm-mm-mm</i>

40:46.177 --> 40:50.248
<i>** Lost inside dark matter</i>

40:51.583 --> 40:54.385
<i>** Lost inside dark matter</i>

40:57.255 --> 40:59.124
<i>** Pink matter, grey matter
Purple sky</i>

40:59.257 --> 41:01.059
<i>** Love matter, you matter
You and I</i>

41:01.192 --> 41:03.261
<i>** Dark matter, green matter
Get me high</i>

41:03.394 --> 41:05.430
<i>** Daydream about the future</i>

41:05.564 --> 41:07.899
<i>** Brighter than Black diamonds</i>

41:08.033 --> 41:09.100
Hey.

41:09.234 --> 41:12.938
<i>** In the sky</i>

41:13.071 --> 41:14.272
You want to know
what the logic is?

41:14.405 --> 41:15.907
<i>** Who are we living for?</i>

41:16.642 --> 41:17.776
Why I keep secrets?

41:18.877 --> 41:20.211
<i>** Who are we living for?</i>

41:20.345 --> 41:21.980
I do it because
I'm terrified.

41:23.248 --> 41:24.315
Of what?

41:24.449 --> 41:25.551
<i>** Tell me who holds the key</i>

41:25.684 --> 41:27.085
The flood gates.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.820
And, no,
they're not tears.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.355
<i>** Nobody seems to know</i>

41:30.488 --> 41:31.623
<i>** Why we're lost
Inside dark matter **</i>

41:31.757 --> 41:33.559
I'm afraid of
losing control.

41:35.393 --> 41:37.095
Of what happens to me
when I do.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.765
So I just...

41:40.766 --> 41:41.967
...hold everything in...

41:44.335 --> 41:45.503
...until I can't...

41:47.673 --> 41:49.575
Until I can't hold it anymore.

41:51.743 --> 41:52.944
It's okay.
Let it out.

41:58.784 --> 42:00.952
We were so happy,
you and I and Weecha.

42:02.954 --> 42:04.990
Raymond,
come to bed.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.226
I should never have
come back.

42:13.765 --> 42:15.033
Come, Raymond.
