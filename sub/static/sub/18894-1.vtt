00:12.400 --> 00:15.600
Hi. How you doing, sweetie?
Come on in.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.600
I already prepared
everything for you...

00:19.600 --> 00:21.600
just the way you like it.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.600
Jeez, it's so hot tonight.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.600
Are you ready?

00:26.200 --> 00:28.600
You want me to play dead?

00:28.800 --> 00:31.200
Do you want me to die, honey?

00:31.400 --> 00:34.600
Please. Please, let me die for you.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.800
Why did you close the windows?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You know I don't scream.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.400
What are you doing, honey?

01:09.200 --> 01:11.200
Is there something wrong?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.800
What's that?

01:24.600 --> 01:26.800
You're hurting me!

01:27.600 --> 01:29.600
Get off! Oh, God!

01:34.400 --> 01:36.400
Please, help me!

02:25.800 --> 02:27.800
What do you know about the killer?

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
We know he's a male, probably aged...

02:31.000 --> 02:34.600
Is there a possibility
there's more than one killer?

02:34.800 --> 02:36.600
No comment.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.800
- You sound confident.
- I am.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.000
- Do we know the killer's race?
- Not definitive.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.400
We are analysing skin samples

02:46.600 --> 02:50.000
taken from underneath
the fingernails of the victims.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.400
Results will help to determine
the killer's race.

02:53.600 --> 02:57.000
Is it true the police aren't
interested in finding the killers

02:57.200 --> 02:59.400
because the victims
were prostitutes?

02:59.400 --> 03:02.800
The suggestion that we're not
treating this case diligently

03:03.000 --> 03:05.400
is not only false but offensive.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.800
We've already spent
1,800 man-hours on this case...

03:17.000 --> 03:19.400
What do you know about the killer?

03:19.600 --> 03:23.000
I can't tell you
all that we know, but he's male...

03:23.000 --> 03:27.200
- You got the job. That job?
- Yeah.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.800
Jesus.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.600
That sounds disgusting.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.200
Don't you think? Don't you think
it's just disgusting?

03:35.200 --> 03:40.800
All I gotta do is sit on my ass
all night and read a book.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.600
- You're drinking too much.
- He's already very drunk.

03:46.800 --> 03:50.400
I think one person
is responsible for these crimes.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.000
- Why do you say that?
- That's my business.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.800
That's all I got to do.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.400
I just got to sit on my ass.
Sit on my ass!

04:02.000 --> 04:03.400
Inspector.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.200
Is it true the police aren't
interested in finding the killers

04:08.400 --> 04:10.600
because the victims
were prostitutes?

04:10.600 --> 04:13.800
The suggestion that we're
not treating this case diligently

04:14.000 --> 04:15.800
is not only false but offensive.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
- Is there more than one killer?
- My feeling is one killer.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.800
- Do you know the killer's race?
- Not definitive.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.600
We are analysing skin samples

04:30.800 --> 04:34.000
taken from underneath
the fingernails of the victims.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.000
Results of those tests...

04:37.200 --> 04:40.600
- Is there more than one killer?
- No comment.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.400
Staying over tonight?

04:51.600 --> 04:55.600
- Do you want me to?
- Do you want to?

04:57.600 --> 04:59.400
If you want me to.

05:03.800 --> 05:08.400
Marie, if I've ever done anything
to make you happy, I truly apologise.

05:10.600 --> 05:15.000
These markings could have occurred
after death while the body was...

05:15.200 --> 05:16.800
Sources have confirmed

05:17.000 --> 05:20.800
that the victims were sexually
assaulted after their deaths.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.200
Is there more than one killer?

05:23.400 --> 05:26.200
It's gotten so hard
to talk her into things.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.400
She's become less and less...

05:31.800 --> 05:33.400
receptive.

05:33.400 --> 05:37.200
- When will the results come in?
- Soon. Maybe tomorrow.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.600
That guy's supposed to be amazing.

05:40.600 --> 05:44.200
- We can't tell the public every...
- Receptive to what?

05:44.400 --> 05:46.600
Were the victims
sexually assaulted?

05:46.800 --> 05:48.800
What do you think of the killer?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.400
I think his time is running out.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.600
Katherine!

05:59.800 --> 06:01.800
Katherine?

06:01.800 --> 06:03.800
I'm in the bathroom!

06:06.400 --> 06:07.400
What?

06:08.600 --> 06:10.600
Nothing.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.600
You had strange dreams last night.

06:22.200 --> 06:24.200
I did?

06:26.600 --> 06:28.800
You were breathing really heavy.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.400
You kept kicking your legs
and moaning.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.800
- You sure we weren't having sex?
- Pretty sure, yeah.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.000
- Call me and tell me how it went.
- Yeah.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.200
- Good night.
- Night.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.600
Mr Johnson?

07:26.200 --> 07:28.000
Mr Johnson.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.800
- How did you get in?
- The front door was open.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.800
Damn door never closes.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.800
So, this is you?

08:00.800 --> 08:04.200
- Oh, yeah, this is me.
- Welcome to Mars.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.800
- Sorry?
- They weren't kidding you.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.200
About what?

08:12.200 --> 08:16.800
I'll leave you the coffee machine.
The radio is mine.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.800
- You got a radio?
- No.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.800
Get yourself a radio.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.800
What did they tell you exactly?

08:26.800 --> 08:28.400
Not a lot.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.800
Now there's very few people around,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.400
but at night,
this place is like Mars.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.600
- So, what have you heard?
- Pardon?

08:37.600 --> 08:40.200
What exactly
did they tell you about me?

08:41.799 --> 08:47.000
- Nothing. They told me nothing.
- Come on. They told you why I quit.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.600
No, honestly, not at all.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.800
May we come in?

09:09.400 --> 09:11.400
Turn the key till you hear the click.

09:11.600 --> 09:16.400
It registers on a piece of punch tape
verifying you were here every hour.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.800
- I see.
- Do you?

09:21.400 --> 09:25.000
Thank God we don't need to check
this room. The key's outside.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.400
Come, have a look.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.000
It's all right. Come on.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.000
- You know what's in those tubs?
- No. What?

09:44.200 --> 09:47.600
Smell the formaldehyde.
You can smell it, can't you?

09:52.600 --> 09:55.000
You should never go in there. Never.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.400
I never have.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.200
Disgusting.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.200
- So, I'll be alone here at night.
- Didn't they tell you?

10:07.200 --> 10:12.200
Sometimes, an ambulance or police
comes in, but apart from that,

10:12.400 --> 10:14.400
it's just you...

10:14.400 --> 10:16.200
and them.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.000
The morgue.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.400
I don't know why
they put a key in there.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.800
The hell with it.
Let's get on with it.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.200
Just keep your eyes on the key.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.400
Just keep looking at it.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.400
Don't look at them.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.800
Damned idiots. Why in the hell
did they put a key in here?

11:12.400 --> 11:14.200
What are the cords for?

11:14.200 --> 11:17.600
Just a precaution,
in case one of them wakes up.

11:17.800 --> 11:21.200
- If you pull it, the alarm goes off.
- Wakes up?

11:21.400 --> 11:24.600
Then you call the duty doctor
from the guard's station.

11:24.800 --> 11:29.600
He'll be here in five minutes.
Don't worry. It'll never happen.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.600
It's cold in here, but you can
still smell 'em, can't you?

11:41.400 --> 11:42.600
Yeah.

11:42.600 --> 11:46.400
Make sure the door doesn't close.
No handle on the inside.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.600
- Why would it close?
- And turn out the lights.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.800
This is where it happened,
supposedly.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.400
What?

11:58.600 --> 12:02.400
Some years ago, scandal,
terrible scandal.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.200
Night watchman.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.800
Many years ago...

12:08.000 --> 12:09.400
he did it.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.000
- He did it?
- Did it with them.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.400
- You mean...
- The guy had his very own harem.

12:18.400 --> 12:23.200
Well, I never knew anything about it
firsthand, but the rumour was,

12:23.400 --> 12:25.200
they caught him doing it.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.800
They hushed the whole thing up.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.600
Who knows? Lots of weirdos out here.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.600
God.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.800
I'm not a weirdo.

12:40.800 --> 12:44.200
After you've worked here a while,
your breath'll begin to stink.

12:44.400 --> 12:48.800
You can test it by holding your
hand up to your mouth and breathe.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.600
Am I right?

12:56.200 --> 12:57.800
Oh, Jesus! You're right.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Goes with the territory.
Nothing you can do about it.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.400
These are the staff files.
We're all in here somewhere.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.400
Dead ones, over there.
Staff, over here.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.000
Meaningless.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.800
Here's your duty roster.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.800
You'll come on at eight,
be relieved at four.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
- Is that the alarm from...?
- It'll never happen.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.400
Have you got a radio?

13:37.600 --> 13:40.200
- Actually, I'm gonna study.
- Get a radio.

13:41.800 --> 13:45.000
- Like I said, I'll get a radio.
- Good.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.600
Who is that picture of?

13:48.800 --> 13:51.600
I don't know. It's always been there.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.600
Oh, one more thing.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.000
There's nothing
to be afraid of, but...

13:59.200 --> 14:01.200
I think it'd be
a good thing to have.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.800
And then the radio...

14:07.200 --> 14:10.000
It'd be a good idea
to buy yourself a radio.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.200
OK.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.400
You have a choice
of seeing two movies.

14:17.400 --> 14:21.400
One, 90 action-packed minutes
of two heroes spending time together

14:21.600 --> 14:23.600
having these incredible adventures.

14:23.800 --> 14:27.600
The other movie has 45 minutes of
one hero having incredible adventures

14:27.600 --> 14:31.200
and the other 45 minutes
is a guy sitting at a desk,

14:31.200 --> 14:33.800
reading a book, OK?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Which one do you go see?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.600
Who's playing the guy
reading the book?

14:42.200 --> 14:44.800
There is definitely
loss of consortium,

14:44.800 --> 14:46.600
but how about mental anguish?

14:47.600 --> 14:50.600
- What happened to us?
- What?

14:52.400 --> 14:55.200
I can't breathe in here.
Why the fuck are we here?

14:55.400 --> 14:57.000
- Getting older.
- We're dying.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
- Same thing.
- No, no, no.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.200
You know this movie
I was talking about?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.600
The two heroes start
challenging each other.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.400
- Really?
- Yes. The one who backs down loses.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.400
Why would they want to do that?

15:18.600 --> 15:21.200
Because they're dying
and they wanna play

15:21.400 --> 15:24.000
before they end up in bed
with the establishment.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.200
OK, so what are the stakes?

15:28.600 --> 15:31.600
If I lose, I marry Marie.
You lose, you marry Katherine.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.600
What?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.600
- Why?
- It's some fun!

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
You are totally insane.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.600
No, I'm not.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.800
Shit.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Shit, the lights.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.200
Weren't you afraid?

22:35.200 --> 22:37.800
No. No. And then I saw these tubs.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.400
There was something in them.
Spare parts.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.800
I saw shadows or something.
I don't know.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.000
That's really sick.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.000
You're dead. What's it matter
what someone does to you?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.800
I just think it's sick, OK?

22:51.800 --> 22:54.200
I have to go to the bathroom.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.800
Yeah, I'll go with you.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.400
So, listen.

23:04.200 --> 23:07.200
Yesterday,
I'm down in Camden near Hyde.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.800
I see this
very attractive-looking girl

23:10.800 --> 23:12.800
standing at a bus stop, right?

23:13.000 --> 23:16.400
But I notice she doesn't get
on any of the buses.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.000
So?

23:18.200 --> 23:21.000
Come on, counsellor.
She was a prostitute.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.600
Seventeen years old. Joyce.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.600
How do you know all that?

23:28.800 --> 23:32.400
Excuse me, those are my quarters.
I got the next game.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.600
- Tough shit.
- All right, I'll get the manager.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.000
I'm gonna go get Satan.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.400
- It's OK.
- Sure?

23:43.600 --> 23:44.600
Yeah.

23:44.800 --> 23:48.200
Let us just play one game
then you guys can play, all right?

23:49.000 --> 23:52.200
Why you look so scared?
I'm just kidding. You all right?

23:52.200 --> 23:54.400
What did you do to him?
Shake my hand.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.000
I'll just play one game, OK?
I'm sorry.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.200
Damn, baby.
Do fries come with that shake?

24:07.400 --> 24:09.000
Please, get out of my way.

24:09.200 --> 24:11.400
Maybe we should do something, huh?

24:11.400 --> 24:13.600
Let me know if you're interested
in nine inches.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.000
I'm very interested in nine inches

24:16.200 --> 24:18.800
but not in fucking you three times
to get it.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.200
Such nasty things
coming from such a pretty mouth.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.400
Where you going?

24:24.600 --> 24:27.000
Did I hurt your feelings? Bitch.

24:27.200 --> 24:31.600
Hi. I hope our little altercation
didn't interrupt your beer-drinking.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.600
We were just discussing
if we should do something.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.600
- Let's go.
- No. We're gonna stay.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.000
No, we're not.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I didn't mean you and me.
I meant me and Martin.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.200
Just a little while.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.000
- Assholes.
- I hope you know what you're doing.

24:51.400 --> 24:55.600
You know, if this was the movie and
you were playing the exciting guy...

24:57.600 --> 25:00.400
you'd go over
and show those guys up.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.200
James. James.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.800
James!

25:06.800 --> 25:08.400
Four, quadruple, Jack.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.800
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
- For what?
- You challenged me.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.000
I take it back.

25:19.200 --> 25:22.000
We're not in grade school.
You can't take it back.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.600
James, don't...

25:32.400 --> 25:34.200
Excuse me.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.400
Hi. I wanted to thank you.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.200
What in the fuck
is you talkin' about, fool?

25:41.200 --> 25:46.000
I wanted to thank you. You know how
long we've been looking for you two?

25:46.200 --> 25:49.800
You're not telling me I'm the first
person to approach you about this?

25:50.000 --> 25:53.200
I'm serious. You guys are gonna be
on talk shows forever.

25:53.400 --> 25:56.400
- Talk shows?
- Oprah, Phil, Sally. You name it.

25:56.600 --> 25:57.800
You like Ricki Lake?

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
What the fuck are you talking about?

26:00.200 --> 26:03.600
When I say we've been looking
for two guys like you, I mean it.

26:03.800 --> 26:07.800
- No one's approached you about this?
- No, nobody's approached me.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.200
That's unbelievable.
Un-fucking-believable.

26:12.400 --> 26:15.000
You go on these talk shows -
and there'll be a lot,

26:15.200 --> 26:17.600
you're gonna be
on the road for weeks.

26:17.800 --> 26:20.600
These guys will ask
the same opening questions.

26:20.800 --> 26:25.400
Maybe we should run through it now,
just so you're prepared, huh?

26:34.400 --> 26:36.200
OK.

26:36.400 --> 26:38.200
Yeah? All right, great.

26:38.200 --> 26:41.800
It's a multipart question,
so answer carefully.

26:43.600 --> 26:47.600
Now, we know for certain
that your parents communicated

26:47.600 --> 26:50.400
through a series
of clicks and grunts.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.600
What we wanna know is how and when

26:52.800 --> 26:55.600
did you acquire
the facility of speech?

26:55.600 --> 27:00.400
All right? Were you the only one in
your group to exhibit this facility?

27:00.600 --> 27:03.800
And when did the majority
of your body fur fall out?

27:03.800 --> 27:05.600
Answer the third part first.

27:05.600 --> 27:06.800
Sure.

27:11.800 --> 27:15.000
Come on back. Let's play some pool.
Where you going?

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
- Non-verbal communication...
- You motherfucker!

27:18.200 --> 27:21.600
- Let's do it. Come here!
- You can't be domesticated.

27:23.400 --> 27:27.000
God! Did you see their faces?
That was great!

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
"When did the majority
of your body fur fall out?"

27:30.200 --> 27:32.000
Did you see them?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.800
- Fuck!
- You all right?

27:37.800 --> 27:39.600
- Goddamnit.
- Are you hurt?

27:39.800 --> 27:41.600
Let's get out of here.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.400
You know, I fucked her.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.000
Who?

27:57.600 --> 27:59.800
The hooker, Joyce. I fucked her.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.400
You fucked a prostitute?

28:07.600 --> 28:09.600
Jesus, what was it like?

28:11.200 --> 28:13.200
It was fascinating.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.600
She did everything I asked.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.400
Everything.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.600
I'd say, "Stand over there,"
she'd say, "Yes, Martin. "

28:22.800 --> 28:25.400
I'd say, "Lay down,"
she'd say, "Yes, Martin. "

28:25.400 --> 28:26.600
What?

28:26.600 --> 28:30.200
- I told her I was you.
- You said you were me. Why?

28:30.400 --> 28:33.200
How would she know
who the fuck you are?

28:37.800 --> 28:40.200
Back at the bar,
you were excited by that.

28:40.200 --> 28:43.400
It was a rush. You felt good.
You felt alive, didn't you?

28:43.600 --> 28:47.000
- Yeah, sure.
- I didn't feel anything. Nothing.

28:48.200 --> 28:52.200
A year ago, I would've felt like you.
I would've felt hyped up, flushed.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.600
But, it's like
my tolerance is increasing

28:55.800 --> 29:00.200
and I can't get that feeling any more
and I have to get that feeling.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.000
I just don't get that feeling
and I need it.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.800
I have to, too.

29:08.200 --> 29:09.400
Do you?

29:12.200 --> 29:14.000
Challenge me.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.400
- OK, do it with Joyce.
- What?

29:20.600 --> 29:22.800
- Do it.
- Yeah, yeah!

29:23.000 --> 29:26.200
Come on. What, do you think
this is just for fun?

29:26.400 --> 29:28.800
And we invite her out, OK?

29:29.000 --> 29:32.200
- Katherine.
- Katherine will never know. Come on.

29:32.400 --> 29:35.800
Find an excuse, OK? Friend?

29:37.600 --> 29:39.000
Buddy?

29:41.400 --> 29:43.000
OK.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.400
You told her you were me? Fuck.

29:56.600 --> 29:59.800
Why do you have to rehearse
in the morning?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.200
Alan likes morning rehearsals.

30:02.200 --> 30:06.800
- Yeah? Well, that guy's a moron.
- Well, he speaks highly of you.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Like I said, the guy's a genius.

30:10.200 --> 30:14.000
- Come on. You know I can't be alone.
- You can.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.600
You got bad breath.

30:25.200 --> 30:27.000
Call me tonight.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.200
You'll be asleep.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.200
Wake me.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.200
Shit.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.000
- Did I scare you?
- No.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.400
I'm sorry. Inspector Cray.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.400
Martin Bells.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.800
- You new here?
- Yeah.

32:39.800 --> 32:43.600
- Law school?
- Yeah, yeah. Last semester, I hope.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.800
That's fascinating for some reason.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.800
It has something to it.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.200
He's dead and he's going to die.

33:06.400 --> 33:10.800
I think his name was Louis Paine,
if I'm not mistaken.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.800
Sitting on death row, waiting.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.600
We could really use one right now.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.600
- A death row?
- No, a murder.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.800
Wait a minute. There's been another?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
They're bringing her in now.

33:34.600 --> 33:37.000
- Have you been in there?
- No.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.400
- You should have a look.
- Nah.

33:39.400 --> 33:44.400
No, you should. Otherwise you'll just
be haunted here working at night.

33:44.600 --> 33:48.000
Nothing cures a fantasy
like a quick dose of reality.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.600
You think so?

33:55.200 --> 33:57.200
Go on.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.000
OK.

34:17.199 --> 34:18.800
Are you all right?

34:19.000 --> 34:22.600
It was just feet. Just feet.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.199
Yeah.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.400
I've been meaning to ask
what they do with them.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.800
By the way, I saw you on TV.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.199
Yeah? How was I?

34:36.800 --> 34:40.400
- Are you on to him?
- We're getting closer.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.199
How do you know
it's just the one guy?

34:49.199 --> 34:52.600
- Can I trust you?
- Well, yeah, absolutely.

34:52.600 --> 34:56.000
Can I trust you with
a bit of privileged information?

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
- Yeah.
- He has a signature.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.400
- Signature?
- He takes their eyes.

35:00.400 --> 35:04.200
- Good evening, guys.
- This one just quit smoking.

35:04.400 --> 35:08.000
Deputy Inspector Bill Davies,
this is the new night watchman.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.800
- What's your name again?
- Martin Bells.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.200
Deputy Inspector Bill Davies.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.600
Bill, Bells. Bells, Bill.

35:39.400 --> 35:42.200
Most people,
when they see something like this,

35:42.200 --> 35:47.800
their immediate reaction is to ask,
"How could somebody do this and why?"

35:50.000 --> 35:53.400
Even when we catch the killer,
they want to know the how and why.

35:55.200 --> 35:59.200
In movies or television, the killer
always explains the how or why.

36:00.200 --> 36:04.200
He always has some reason, however
crazy. A mad gleam in his eye.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.400
I've interrogated murderers
like this one before.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
Let me tell you, they are well beyond
the need to justify what they do.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.000
They just do it.

36:30.600 --> 36:34.200
Explanations are just a fiction
to make us feel safe.

36:39.800 --> 36:44.000
Because if it can't be explained,
then it's just meaningless chaos.

36:44.200 --> 36:47.000
It could touch any one of us
at any moment.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.200
Which is exactly what it is.

37:03.200 --> 37:05.200
I would have been sick.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.600
I have a high tolerance
for that stuff.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.400
I still think it's weird.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.800
- Why?
- You don't think it's weird?

37:11.800 --> 37:14.400
Why shouldn't I see the body?
I work there.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.600
How do you know it's the same guy?

37:16.600 --> 37:18.600
Some of us just know.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.800
What is that supposed to mean?

37:22.000 --> 37:24.600
Nothing. I'm sworn to secrecy.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.600
- Come on.
- I can't tell you.

37:29.800 --> 37:32.600
Wait a minute. You can't tell me?

37:32.800 --> 37:37.600
Katherine, you wouldn't want to know.
Believe me.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.000
Jerk.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.200
- Duty nurse.
- This is night watchman from 03.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.800
- The alarm just went off.
- The alarm?

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
The alarm from the morgue went off.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.400
- What was that?
- The alarm from the morgue.

38:36.600 --> 38:40.200
- Oh, well...
- Well?

38:40.200 --> 38:42.400
You should just
go and check it, then.

38:42.600 --> 38:45.400
The doctor will be there
in about 30 minutes.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.000
What! But what if it...?

38:47.200 --> 38:50.400
Just go down and check it out
and find the defect.

38:51.400 --> 38:54.200
What if it's not a defect?

38:54.200 --> 38:56.200
Don't worry. It is.

40:07.600 --> 40:11.000
You crazy bastard! You're insane!
What the hell are you doing?

40:11.200 --> 40:13.800
- Who do you think you are?
- I couldn't help it.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.400
- I almost had a heart attack.
- But you didn't.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.400
Christ, I almost shit myself!

40:21.400 --> 40:23.400
How the hell did you get in here?

40:23.400 --> 40:27.400
The front door doesn't close right
and you're buried in that book.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.800
I stood and watched you
for five minutes!

40:30.000 --> 40:32.200
You scared ten years off my life.

40:32.400 --> 40:36.400
I called the duty doctor.
They're gonna think I've gone crazy.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
You know, it's a really
beautiful place you got here.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.800
It's cosy!

40:47.600 --> 40:51.600
I talked to Joyce.
Remember, your name is James.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.800
I can't handle
any more of your ideas.

40:53.800 --> 40:56.400
All you have to do is show up.
I promise.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.200
Dress nice.

41:01.400 --> 41:05.600
Like I'm gonna tell Katherine
I'm dressing nice to study with you.

41:06.800 --> 41:09.400
Tell her that we're studying opera.

41:09.600 --> 41:12.400
Figaro. Figaro. Figaro.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.200
You're a fucking nutcase!

41:24.200 --> 41:27.400
That's Mr Fucking Nutcase
to you, pal!

41:48.000 --> 41:50.800
Kje kej je

41:52.200 --> 41:56.800
It was my fuckin' alarm clock.
I'm sorry. What a shock.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.800
- Can I offer you something?
- Excuse me?

42:02.000 --> 42:06.600
Have you ever spent any time
with the Zine family?

42:06.800 --> 42:09.000
What?

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
Thorazine, Stelazine, Compazine...

42:14.200 --> 42:15.400
No!

42:15.400 --> 42:17.400
They're really very nice.

42:18.200 --> 42:22.400
They will make you sing hymns while
you watch a baby fall under a train.

42:23.400 --> 42:25.800
No, thank you. I'm fine. Thanks.

42:30.800 --> 42:33.800
Listen, we don't have time
for screwed-up kids.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.400
Just don't freak out again.

42:38.600 --> 42:39.600
OK?

42:44.400 --> 42:46.200
Those'll kill you.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.600
Thank you.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.200
She's probably not coming.

43:04.400 --> 43:08.400
Impatience is
an early indicator of boringness.

43:08.600 --> 43:11.800
- "Boringness"? That's not a word.
- Here we go.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.600
Joyce. Friend to the working man.
Good luck, James.

43:16.800 --> 43:19.400
Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.400
- Hello.
- Hi.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.400
- I'm Joyce.
- I'm James.

43:25.600 --> 43:29.000
Good evening.
Allow me to congratulate you both.

43:29.200 --> 43:32.000
- Congratulate us?
- On your engagement.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.600
Why, thank you.

43:38.200 --> 43:40.600
- Would you care to order now?
- Sure.

43:40.800 --> 43:43.600
I didn't get a chance to...

43:44.600 --> 43:47.000
I think we'll have the cod fish.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.600
- Very good.
- I don't like fish.

43:49.600 --> 43:53.000
Oh, of course.
Well, the filet mignon.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.600
How would you like those?

43:54.600 --> 43:56.400
- Medium.
- Rare.

43:56.400 --> 43:58.600
- Rare.
- Of course. Thank you.

44:07.200 --> 44:09.400
So, where do you come from?

44:09.400 --> 44:11.000
Home.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.600
Oh, no, I meant...

44:15.000 --> 44:16.200
San Diego.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.200
Wow, San Diego.

44:20.800 --> 44:23.400
- How did you get here?
- Walked.

44:23.400 --> 44:25.400
No, I meant from San Diego.

44:26.400 --> 44:27.600
Drove.

44:32.200 --> 44:35.000
- Do you like it here?
- It's OK.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I was on my way to Nepal.

44:39.200 --> 44:42.200
Nepal? Wow. What's in Nepal?

44:42.400 --> 44:43.800
Monks.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.600
Oh, right.

44:50.200 --> 44:52.000
What are you doing?

44:52.000 --> 44:54.400
Martin said
I had to do it right away.

44:55.800 --> 44:57.200
Martin said.

45:06.600 --> 45:07.800
You called?

45:08.600 --> 45:10.600
No. Actually, we're fine.

45:39.600 --> 45:43.000
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

45:44.200 --> 45:45.200
What?

45:45.400 --> 45:48.000
Excuse me. Can I have a word, please?

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Just for a second.

45:56.600 --> 45:58.800
You went too far this time, "Martin".

46:03.800 --> 46:05.600
What do I... What do I owe you?

46:05.800 --> 46:07.600
Fifty.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.800
Cheers.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.600
I don't drink. It makes me sick.

46:21.800 --> 46:22.800
Really?

46:25.800 --> 46:28.000
How much to drink a glass of whisky?

46:30.800 --> 46:32.800
Twenty.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.400
Twenty bucks? Yeah? OK.

46:36.800 --> 46:39.000
Whoa, wait.
I didn't say how big it would be.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.400
Bottoms up.

46:49.800 --> 46:52.200
I guess you hear
that phrase quite a bit.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.600
Joyce, you're dribbling.
That wasn't part of the deal.

47:03.600 --> 47:05.200
All right.

47:05.400 --> 47:07.200
I'll give you $100.

47:07.200 --> 47:11.600
$100, if you can tell me
that you love me...

47:11.800 --> 47:14.200
- I love you.
... and make me believe it.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.800
- I love you.
- No, come on.

47:16.800 --> 47:20.600
It's too fast. Didn't ring true.
I didn't believe it. Did you?

47:20.800 --> 47:23.400
- I don't...
- OK, I'll add another 50.

47:23.600 --> 47:25.800
That's all my allowance now.

47:28.200 --> 47:30.800
It's all yours
if you can make it sound real.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.000
- I love you.
- No. Come on.

47:34.200 --> 47:36.400
- I love you.
- No, make me believe it.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.400
- I...
- Make it sound real.

47:38.400 --> 47:40.600
I love you.

47:40.800 --> 47:42.400
No.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.800
I didn't believe it. Sorry.

47:50.200 --> 47:52.400
How you feeling, Joyce?

47:52.600 --> 47:53.600
OK.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.600
- Why do you take all this shit?
- What's it to you?

47:59.400 --> 48:02.400
- Tell us about your customers.
- Why?

48:02.600 --> 48:06.000
Tell us about your clients,
the weird ones. Tell us what they do.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
- Why?
- Curiosity.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.200
Answer the fucking question.

48:16.200 --> 48:19.600
One dresses up like a baby
and makes me change his...

48:19.800 --> 48:22.000
That's not weird enough.

48:23.200 --> 48:25.600
- One guy makes me pee...
- Weirder.

48:27.600 --> 48:29.600
One guy makes me pretend I'm dead.

48:29.800 --> 48:31.600
Yes!

48:34.200 --> 48:38.000
He covers me in a sheet and puts
a tag on my toe and then he...

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Then he what?

48:41.200 --> 48:43.600
- Then he...
- Then he what?

48:46.400 --> 48:48.400
Tell us what's wrong, Joyce.

48:49.400 --> 48:52.000
My friend, Leanne,
brought the psycho home.

48:52.200 --> 48:53.600
And?

48:53.800 --> 48:56.200
And she...

48:56.400 --> 48:58.200
They...

49:00.600 --> 49:02.800
- I'd rather not.
- Tell us.

49:05.200 --> 49:07.400
No. Please, can I go now?

49:08.600 --> 49:10.600
Please, tell us.

49:12.400 --> 49:15.000
They made me identify her body.

49:15.200 --> 49:17.200
He took her eyes.

49:20.400 --> 49:25.000
Could there be a relation between
the guy that makes you pretend...

49:25.200 --> 49:26.800
What the hell do you care?

49:30.800 --> 49:32.400
Can I go now?

49:32.400 --> 49:35.000
You think you've met him?

49:40.400 --> 49:42.200
Can I go now?

50:02.800 --> 50:04.600
How was your evening?

50:05.800 --> 50:09.200
OK, you know. Typical James.

50:11.400 --> 50:14.600
- I don't know how Marie takes it.
- Me neither.

50:17.800 --> 50:19.600
Who's Joyce?

50:21.800 --> 50:23.600
Joyce?

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I don't know. Why?

50:28.600 --> 50:31.000
She called late, asking for you.

50:32.400 --> 50:34.000
For me?

50:35.200 --> 50:36.600
Yes.

50:37.800 --> 50:41.400
I don't know.
I don't know who that could be.

50:45.800 --> 50:48.200
Did she say what it was about?

50:49.600 --> 50:51.200
No.

50:52.200 --> 50:54.600
- She leave a number?
- No.

50:58.400 --> 51:00.000
I don't know.

51:15.400 --> 51:18.000
Here's Johnny!

51:40.400 --> 51:44.600
And the question still remains,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

51:44.600 --> 51:47.200
what did the defendant know?

51:47.200 --> 51:49.200
When did he know it?

51:49.400 --> 51:51.200
And if he's so fucking smart...

52:22.200 --> 52:24.400
- Hello.
- Have you been here?

52:24.400 --> 52:26.600
- I can't hear you.
- Have you been here?

52:26.800 --> 52:30.000
Come to think of it,
I'm not even home. Leave a message.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
The boy who cried zombie.

52:58.200 --> 53:00.000
Just you wait.

53:07.600 --> 53:09.400
She's down there.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.200
OK, which one was it?

53:29.800 --> 53:31.800
Think you can still remember?

53:32.800 --> 53:35.600
- It was the prostitute.
- Prostitute.

53:36.600 --> 53:39.600
Well, good morning, Miss Singer.

53:40.800 --> 53:44.200
This young man claims
that you've been up and about.

53:47.400 --> 53:49.600
Well, isn't that strange?

53:49.800 --> 53:53.600
She appears to be as dead
as a fucking doornail.

53:53.800 --> 53:56.800
But I saw her there.
I saw her like I'm seeing you.

54:00.600 --> 54:04.800
Hello? Miss Singer?
Hello! Is this thing on?

54:07.400 --> 54:08.800
Still dead.

54:08.800 --> 54:10.400
Listen. I saw...

54:10.400 --> 54:12.600
- What's going on?
- Sorry, Inspector,

54:12.600 --> 54:15.000
but I thought
I might need some backup.

54:17.200 --> 54:20.000
- Did you have a problem?
- Yeah! I saw this...

54:20.000 --> 54:22.600
His problem is he's under-medicated.

54:22.800 --> 54:24.600
I saw her in the hallway.

54:25.800 --> 54:28.400
I've gotten rid of people
for much less.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.200
This is like one of those
movies on the USA Network.

54:38.400 --> 54:41.200
- What do you mean?
- The hero sees something weird

54:41.400 --> 54:43.400
and then no one will believe him.

54:44.600 --> 54:46.600
You know, sometimes, Martin,

54:46.600 --> 54:50.200
when you get overly tired,
the lines get a little blurry.

54:50.200 --> 54:52.800
No, but I saw it.

54:53.800 --> 54:57.400
- Now that guy thinks I'm crazy.
- No, no, no. Forget the doctor.

54:57.600 --> 55:02.000
I think he has too much access to
the medicines he freely prescribes.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
You saw what you saw.

55:05.400 --> 55:07.200
Here, Martin.

55:09.400 --> 55:11.600
You can always reach me here.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.400
Oh, OK.

55:14.600 --> 55:16.400
Try and take it easy.

55:19.200 --> 55:22.000
- Don't go back.
- We need the money.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
We can borrow from my mother.

55:26.200 --> 55:28.600
We don't want your family's money.

55:31.200 --> 55:33.400
By the time my father was 22,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.400
he was married
to a woman he didn't love

55:39.200 --> 55:42.400
and he was having an affair
with the woman he did.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.200
And what does that mean to you?

55:50.600 --> 55:52.600
That he was afraid.

55:52.800 --> 55:54.800
- Of what?
- Of life.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.400
- Yes.
- Will you marry me?

56:14.400 --> 56:16.000
Yes.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Shit, I hate that place.

56:31.400 --> 56:35.600
Are you Katherine, Martin's...
Martin's girlfriend?

56:38.000 --> 56:42.200
I can't... I know I'm supposed
to memorise it,

56:42.400 --> 56:44.400
but I forget.

56:47.200 --> 56:49.600
Maybe...

56:49.600 --> 56:52.600
Maybe you could write it down for me.

56:58.200 --> 57:02.200
You're not gonna give it to me
until I remember. I know.

57:05.600 --> 57:09.600
If you write it down,
I'll remember. I swear.

57:36.200 --> 57:38.400
- Are you Katherine?
- Yes.

57:38.600 --> 57:41.400
- Martin's girlfriend?
- Yes.

57:44.200 --> 57:46.600
Please make him stop it.

57:46.600 --> 57:49.000
Won't you please make him stop?

57:53.800 --> 57:56.000
- Hello?
- Hello.

57:56.200 --> 57:59.200
- How was it?
- We finished early.

58:03.800 --> 58:04.800
What was that?

58:05.000 --> 58:08.200
Let's get one thing straight,
you shit. I'm not Marie!

58:08.200 --> 58:12.600
If you wanna treat someone like James
treats Marie, find somebody else.

58:12.800 --> 58:14.600
What are you talking about?

58:14.800 --> 58:17.400
- I met your little slave girl today.
- Who?

58:17.400 --> 58:18.600
Joyce.

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
Yeah, go ahead, tell me
she's some little lying junkie whore

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
who makes up stories. Go on!

58:29.200 --> 58:31.000
Look, I... I...

58:32.800 --> 58:35.400
- Do you want me to play dead?
- What?

58:37.400 --> 58:40.000
- You screwed her, didn't you?
- No!

58:40.200 --> 58:42.200
No, it was just a game, I swear!

58:42.400 --> 58:44.400
What did she say?

58:45.200 --> 58:47.600
Do you want me to play dead?

58:47.600 --> 58:50.200
Is that what turns you on?

58:51.200 --> 58:52.200
What?

58:54.400 --> 58:57.400
- Is that how you like it?
- No, Katherine.

58:57.600 --> 58:58.800
Katherine, what...?

59:00.000 --> 59:02.600
- What are...?
- Did you enjoy it?

59:05.800 --> 59:07.400
Shit.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.200
What?

59:52.000 --> 59:53.600
Did you enjoy it?

59:55.000 --> 59:57.600
- Excuse me?
- Did you enjoy it?

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.400
- Hello, Martin.
- Hi.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.000
How are you?

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.000
I don't know.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.600
Tell me, Martin,
you did your rounds last night?

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.800
Of course. Why?

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.200
Come with me.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.000
What can you tell me about that?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I don't know.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.200
- Paul.
- I see a dead girl

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.400
turned over on her stomach
with her legs spread apart,

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.400
as though she's been
sexually assaulted.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.400
The doctor tells me you're
the only one that's been in here.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.800
Cray. You might want
to have a look at this.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:37.000
Martin, what can you tell me
about the drops of semen over there?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.400
Someone's trying to frame me.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.800
I'm as confused as you are,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.800
but the murder victim's
played tricks twice now

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
and you've been involved both times.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.000
- Do you have any enemies?
- Not that I know of.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.600
Debts? Old grudges?
Angry drug dealers? Anything?

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.000
Wait a minute. There was someone.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.200
This hooker, Joyce.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.000
I went with her.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.800
I see.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
The girl down there was her friend.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.800
She identified the body.
The police must know her.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.800
- Young girl. Redhead, skinny.
- Yeah, right.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.800
I remember interviewing her.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.200
What happened?

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.600
First, she called my house one night.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.600
Then she met my girlfriend and
said I'd done stuff that I never did.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.200
Why would she do that?

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.800
- How did you meet her?
- Through a friend. It was a joke.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.800
Friend? Which friend?

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.400
Just some guy, James.
It was supposed to be a joke.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.600
So many things are.
What's your friend's full name?

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.200
James Christian Galman.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.600
- Martin.
- Yeah?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.600
If all this is what I think it is...

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
there's someone very dangerous
standing right behind you in the dark

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.000
breathing down your neck.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.800
And maybe you've unwittingly
become his link to Joyce.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.800
What do you mean, "his link"?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.200
I think the murderer
wants the murder to be exposed.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:12.800
- I still don't get it.
- Well, I think he wants to stop.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.800
I think he's tired of killing.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.800
Wants to be free.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.000
But he won't be free
as long as we're looking for him.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.600
And how long
will we continue looking for him?

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.800
Till we catch the killer.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.800
So what's the solution
to his dilemma?

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.600
Get somebody else caught
in his place.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:44.200
He chooses a new victim...

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.000
and then he makes someone else
look guilty when he kills her.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.800
He's already gained Joyce's trust.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.600
Now all he needs to do
is find her killer.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.800
Her killer?

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.200
No, this is too absurd.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.000
Why does Joyce suddenly call you?
Why does she go see your girlfriend?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.200
Think about what's happened here.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.400
Think about that doctor that looks
at you without doubt in his mind.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.000
Even Deputy Inspector Bill
suspects you.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.200
No, you can't be serious.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:35.600
Don't worry, Martin.
I know it's not you.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.800
It has to be someone
that knows his way around here.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.600
So, what about
the old night watchman?

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.400
Yes, I'll look into it.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.800
- What about the semen in the morgue?
- What about it?

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.200
Yes, well,
the lab is gonna analyse it,

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.400
but in the meantime,
can we have a sample from you?

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.800
Martin, it's Joyce.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.800
I need to see you. It's important.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.600
There are some things I need to tell
you that I couldn't tell you before.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.400
I need to see you in person,
tonight at eight.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.200
Excuse me?

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:34.200
My address is 9248 Second Street,
number 322.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.600
Fuck this!

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.200
He wasn't at home.
It was the answering machine.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.200
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.800
What's the matter with you?

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.800
What are you doing with Joyce?

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.800
- What?
- The police can't find the murderer.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Someone raped one of the victims.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.200
- Someone threatened Joyce.
- Shit.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.800
- So, they know who it is?
- They have a suspect.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.600
- Who is it?
- The wrong guy, I guess.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.600
I guess they got the wrong guy.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.400
You wanna narrow that down
a little bit? Which wrong guy?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
- It's me.
- You?

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.200
They think it's you?

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.400
Oh, boy!

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.400
Boy, they got the wrong guy.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:09.200
I'll ask you this once and then I'll
walk away and forget all about it.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.200
OK.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.000
Is it you?

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.800
Martin!

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.600
Oh, come on. Martin!

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:43.400
It makes me sick
when I think of the scum out there.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.400
God gave him over...

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:50.000
in the sinful desires of
their hearts, to sexual impurity...

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.600
Do you know...

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.000
Do you know where the Himalayas are?

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.000
I have always wanted
to go to the Himalayas.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.200
I've always wanted to go there.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
I've always wanted
to go to the Himalayas.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.800
Hello?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.400
Hello?

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.200
Hello?

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:39.400
Martin, it's Joyce.
I need to see you.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.600
It's important.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:46.000
There are some things I need to tell
you that I couldn't tell you before.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:50.800
I need to see you in person,
tonight at eight.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.400
My address is 9248 Second Street,
number 322.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:18.600
Damn, what if you wouldn't
have gotten out of there?

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:21.000
Can you imagine what he would...

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.200
Katherine,
we have to call the police.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.000
We can't let her just lie there.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.800
They found her.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.600
A young girl was found dead tonight,
the third in as many weeks.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:43.200
We have all the evidence we need.
We'll have closure soon.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.200
I'd like to talk to the duty doctor.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.000
One moment.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.600
- Hello?
- Yeah, hello. This is Martin Bells.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.800
You know, the screwed-up kid
from Forensics.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.600
- Joyce asked me to say hello.
- Who?

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.200
Joyce. Your playmate.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.600
Listen. I have personally asked
for your removal. Go home.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:13.200
Well, I thought
you'd want me to stay.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.400
Go and see a psychiatrist.

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.200
Do you think I'm a psychopath?

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.000
You wouldn't be
the first night watchman who was.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.600
The first.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.200
The first.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.400
Deputy Inspector Bill Davies,
I'd like to speak to Martin Bells.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.400
- He's not here.
- We don't know where he is.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.600
- Hello.
- Yeah, hi. It's me.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:49.400
Joyce has been murdered. The cops
are here looking for you right now.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.800
- I'm going over.
- It's too dangerous.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.200
He didn't do it!

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.000
Keep your ears open.
I'm gonna try something.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.200
- Martin is not a murderer.
- We don't make up evidence.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.000
He's a suspect because weird things
happened at work?

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.400
Listen. She exposed him herself.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.800
- She wrote his name.
- What did she write?

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.000
- His name.
- Yeah, but what name?

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.400
Martin.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.800
We changed the names.
Joyce thought he was James

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.200
so she would have written James.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.200
- That makes you our prime suspect.
- This is ridiculous.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.200
- There was no name.
- What?

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.200
Katherine was there.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.400
You were there? When?

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:43.400
There was a lot of blood.
But there was no name.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.600
And the murderer...

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.600
was still there.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.600
- What?
- Katherine.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.400
Hello.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.400
Yeah, hello? This is Martin Bells.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:10.800
The new... new night watchman.
You showed me around here.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.800
You know what time it is?

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.600
Inspector Cray, please. Well,
where'd he go? The hospital? Alone?

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:20.800
You told me the story about
the guy who did it with... you know.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.600
- When was it?
- The guy with the corpses?

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:26.600
- Yeah.
- Before I started, late '60s.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:30.000
- Do you remember his name?
- No.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.800
- And what happened to him?
- Nothing.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.200
- What?
- The embarrassment.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.400
The hospital couldn't press charges.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.400
No. I guess
he's out there somewhere.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.000
Where is she?

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.400
Cray.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.200
Hello?

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.200
Martin, it's Inspector Cray.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.000
We have a situation here.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Joyce has been murdered.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.200
We have to talk.

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.400
Well, I'll come down to the station.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.400
We really have to get
to the bottom of this.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.200
I think it might be better
if I pick you up.

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.200
Martin?

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:33.800
- Are you still there?
- I'd prefer to come to the station.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.400
I'll come and get you.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:42.600
Tell me, Martin. Are you still
gonna maintain your innocence?

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.200
Yeah.

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.400
Who else could it be, Martin?

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.400
The killing has to stop, Martin.
Don't you want it to stop?

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.400
Maybe I could talk
to Deputy Inspector Bill.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.200
Why wouldn't you want to talk to me?

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.600
You're under arrest, Martin.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.800
Would you please put this
on your desk?

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:35.200
We have all the time in the world
to wait for your confession, Martin.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.200
All the time in the world.

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.800
I want you to do me a favour, Martin.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.800
- Hit me.
- What?

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.200
Come on, hit me.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.400
How much more can you take?

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.000
Do you know what they'll do to you?

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.600
They'll snuff you out
like a bug hitting a windshield.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:11.000
You're going to die anyway, Martin.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.400
Don't you know
that you're going to die?

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.000
Come on, Martin.
You've got to do something.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Protect yourself. Save yourself.
This is your last chance!

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.600
Do something...

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.800
or I'll take your girlfriend's eyes.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.800
Martin?

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:58.000
He's gone mad! Get in the hall!
Get in the hall!

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
No!

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.600
Katherine!

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.200
I shouldn't be telling you this,

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.600
but she wrote his name
before she died.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:19.200
I know.
Deputy Inspector Bill told me.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.600
Deputy Inspector Bill told you?

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.800
That's highly unorthodox.

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:43.600
I'm very glad you told me this.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
This changes everything.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.400
All right, let's go through
this one more time.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:00.600
Why didn't you call
from Joyce's apartment?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.600
Because the murderer was still there.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.600
The murderer was still there?

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.600
She was already dead.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.600
- She was already dead?
- She hadn't written anything, so...

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.800
- Yes?
- Someone else must have written it.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.600
Trying to frame Martin, right?

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.600
Trying to frame Martin? Yes.

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.200
Where are we?

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.600
Interesting theory.

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:45.400
What do we do now?

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.800
Martin, I'm waiting.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.800
Hey, I was worried about you.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.600
- He hit me and escaped.
- Something's wrong.

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.400
Nothing's wrong. Who's this?

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:26.600
James.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
- Where's Katherine?
- How should I know?

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:37.200
Her bike's outside,
she must be in here somewhere.

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.000
She's not in here. He, uh...

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.800
He probably took her with him.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Martin!

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.800
Help!

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.400
Help us!

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.200
Take him to the station. I'll take
a look at Joyce. I'll meet you there.

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:31.800
- Wait, why would they try to escape?
- Take it easy.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.400
Handcuff him.

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.600
What?

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:46.600
You're under arrest
for suspicion of murder.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:55.800
This is bullshit.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.800
You have doubts too. Tell him!

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Doubts?

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.400
Doubts about what,
Deputy Inspector Bill?

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.000
Nothing.

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.400
I don't like it when you keep things
from me, Deputy Inspector Bill.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:32.600
I've always encouraged you
to have your own ideas, haven't I?

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.800
- Yeah. It's nothing. He's babbling.
- You said something was wrong.

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.000
Well, something is definitely wrong.
Take him away.

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.600
Have you ever been killed before?

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I'll be back in a minute.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.600
No. No. No.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.600
This just doesn't happen.
It's not happening.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:15.400
Cray, why are you doing this?

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.400
What the hell are you doing?

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.800
Stop asking for the how and why,
Martin.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Does it hurt?

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:07.000
Let's grow old together.

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:11.400
Yeah.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.600
Let's get older.

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:24.000
There's a challenge.

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:35.400
James, we're gonna take a little ride
now, all right? Keep that up.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:37.200
Can you walk?

01:32:38.305 --> 01:32:44.408
