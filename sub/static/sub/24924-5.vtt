00:06.420 --> 00:08.832
[theme music playing]

00:28.520 --> 00:31.523
[Ryan] Nothing that's worth anything
comes without pain.

00:31.610 --> 00:32.986
["Damaged Goods" playing]

00:43.540 --> 00:46.782
A work of art is only good
if it arises from necessity,

00:47.460 --> 00:48.415
from need.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.299
And it can be political need
or personal need

00:54.090 --> 00:56.126
or, ideally, both.

00:57.050 --> 00:59.257
Sometimes I'm thinking
That I love you...

00:59.350 --> 01:03.093
[Ryan] Art should be confrontation.
It should shock and scare you.

01:04.680 --> 01:05.590
And Hannah,

01:06.850 --> 01:08.477
she was an artist in need.

01:10.190 --> 01:11.771
And I think that's what happened.

01:12.980 --> 01:14.277
And she freaked people out.

01:14.530 --> 01:16.737
-[Cyrus clears throat]
-All right.

01:17.530 --> 01:18.485
[Tyler laughs]

01:18.570 --> 01:24.156
And how does this not make us more likely
to be the targets of abuse and ridicule?

01:24.870 --> 01:28.078
Because it's like claiming the word
as our own.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.785
Reappropriation.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.952
Like saying we're the assholes,
so don't fuck with us.

01:33.170 --> 01:36.378
Okay, yeah, sort of like
our superhero outfits, right?

01:36.470 --> 01:40.839
Like, "It's a bird, it's a plane,
it's the Assholes. It's us."

01:41.100 --> 01:43.557
Yeah. Just maybe don't say that.

01:45.850 --> 01:47.590
Your kiss so sweet

01:48.810 --> 01:50.721
Your sweat so sour

01:51.650 --> 01:53.857
Sometimes I'm thinking
That I love you...

01:53.940 --> 01:56.272
[Ryan] A soul in need
needs a way to express it.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.906
Silence is never the answer.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.651
But when there's so much going on
inside you...

02:02.740 --> 02:04.116
[keys jingling]

02:05.200 --> 02:07.577
...society expects us to stay silent.

02:16.420 --> 02:19.924
And it's a dangerous thing
when there's so much going on inside you,

02:20.890 --> 02:22.426
but no one to share it with.

02:22.550 --> 02:23.960
[door opens]

02:24.060 --> 02:26.711
Kevin? Honey, you forgot your lunch.

02:27.310 --> 02:29.596
-Thanks. I'll be right there.
-Okay.

02:48.290 --> 02:51.202
[Chle] Good Lord.
These morning practices are killing me.

02:51.710 --> 02:54.338
I'm passing out at exactly 4:30 today.

02:55.670 --> 02:58.503
-Or you could come back to my place.
-[sighs]

02:58.760 --> 03:00.671
I don't think I'm gonna have the energy--

03:00.760 --> 03:02.716
For dinner? My parents wanna meet you.

03:02.800 --> 03:03.676
-They do?
-Yeah.

03:03.930 --> 03:06.000
-That's so cool.
-[chuckles]

03:06.100 --> 03:08.762
-Oh, my God, that's so terrifying.
-No. It's no big deal.

03:08.850 --> 03:10.727
My dad happens to be in town for a bit.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.470
I'm always talking about you.

03:13.690 --> 03:16.648
I'm so excited. Amazing.

03:16.860 --> 03:18.225
-See you in third.
-Okay. Bye.

03:21.990 --> 03:23.480
Babe, I wanted to talk to you about--

03:23.570 --> 03:25.197
Wait. I should buy a dress.

03:25.410 --> 03:27.731
-You don't need to buy a dress.
-Or at least go and change.

03:27.830 --> 03:30.651
-I'll need at least an hour, okay?
-Yeah, fine.

03:30.870 --> 03:32.610
Hey, uh, how is practice

03:32.710 --> 03:36.089
with all the captain stuff
and, you know, Jess?

03:36.420 --> 03:38.297
It's great. It's going really well.

03:38.550 --> 03:40.006
Cool. Awesome. Okay.

03:40.090 --> 03:41.045
-Bye.
-Bye.

03:42.550 --> 03:44.586
[Ryan] Hannah needed
to reclaim her power.

03:45.510 --> 03:47.171
Are you gonna ask him about the Polaroid?

03:48.140 --> 03:50.176
I don't trust him any more
than I did yesterday.

03:50.270 --> 03:53.683
[exhales] How can you not trust
that little sleeping angel?

04:00.990 --> 04:02.389
The fuck are you looking at?

04:04.160 --> 04:07.197
Justin, do you think
that you can keep your shit together

04:07.280 --> 04:09.942
until someone comes over
to look after you later?

04:10.410 --> 04:12.321
I'm running late. I gotta get to school.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.327
I'm fine. I don't need a babysitter.

04:16.580 --> 04:18.457
It's just so fucking cold in here.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.542
-[Hannah] Chills. He has a fever.
-It's chills. You have a fever.

04:21.630 --> 04:23.166
Well, get him another blanket.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.017
-Maybe a shower would help.
-I'm not that bad.

04:35.100 --> 04:38.433
You smell like dead feet.
Just shower, please.

04:38.940 --> 04:39.929
Oh, I'm hungry.

04:41.230 --> 04:43.482
How can you be hungry?
You threw everything up.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.520
Maybe that's why I'm hungry.

04:48.780 --> 04:49.690
Take a shower.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.149
Have you seen this?

04:54.660 --> 04:58.744
My God, was there anyone in your class
this Hannah wasn't involved with?

05:00.040 --> 05:01.246
What? What do you mean?

05:01.420 --> 05:03.661
Every day,
there's another boy in this story.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.132
It's not surprising
that she had a reputation.

05:10.140 --> 05:13.553
I will just be glad
when this is all over for you tomorrow,

05:14.020 --> 05:17.057
and you are as far removed
from this mess as possible.

05:19.190 --> 05:20.054
Yep.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.180
[shower running]

05:29.450 --> 05:30.940
[faint splattering]

05:31.870 --> 05:33.076
[sighs]

05:33.950 --> 05:36.612
Hey. Your mom's starting to think
you're avoiding us.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.953
[stammers] Avoiding you? No. No, no.
I've just got a lot going on, you know?

05:41.040 --> 05:42.871
You can't take every meal in your room.

05:44.210 --> 05:47.429
I've just got so much work.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.384
How about taking a break with me tonight?
Vertigo is at the Crestmont.

05:51.470 --> 05:52.380
Let's go.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.267
Oh, wow. I, um...

05:56.430 --> 05:57.931
Is that the shower?

05:58.020 --> 06:00.011
Yeah. Yeah, that's my, um...

06:00.480 --> 06:02.971
I just figured I'd grab some food
while I let it heat up.

06:03.070 --> 06:05.106
The new tankless heater
takes a while to warm up.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.238
-Shouldn't take this long.
-It's not a big deal.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.948
No, sometimes the valve
is on the cold side.

06:10.030 --> 06:11.315
It's all good. Have some coffee.

06:12.410 --> 06:14.150
Yeah, I'll get more. Yeah. Movie tonight?

06:14.700 --> 06:16.941
Exciting. So, yeah, thanks.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.000
What the fuck?

06:27.090 --> 06:30.253
Yeah, Dad. Plenty hot.
Water heater's totally working.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.386
-[Justin] Shit. Sorry.
-Just quiet.

06:36.470 --> 06:37.550
Okay.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.134
[sighs]

06:45.230 --> 06:46.310
Can you get out now?

06:46.860 --> 06:49.067
It has to look like
I'm the one in the shower, idiot.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.448
Well, can you pass me some more shampoo?

06:55.700 --> 06:57.406
These kids need to be sympathetic, Olivia.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.822
I worry about calling Ryan Shaver.
His deposition was practically smug.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.912
We're putting pieces together. We have to
get Hannah's poem into evidence,

07:04.000 --> 07:05.240
and he's the one who...

07:06.710 --> 07:07.540
printed it.

07:10.800 --> 07:11.619
Morning.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.881
-Hi. I'm Andy.
-Oh, of course, I remember.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.636
-Will you be joining us today?
-No, he won't.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.056
Well, I'll give you two a minute.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.180
I wanna be here with you.

07:29.780 --> 07:33.022
I need to be here.
I'm sorry I haven't been.

07:33.780 --> 07:35.577
The things they've been saying in there,

07:36.450 --> 07:40.284
things that you'll hear, you have no idea.

07:41.710 --> 07:42.529
I'll learn.

07:47.210 --> 07:51.044
[Justin] I don't know.
It's definitely not the pool house.

07:52.630 --> 07:54.177
[Clay] So, where is it, then?

07:54.680 --> 07:57.808
I could ask one of the guys
and maybe figure out--

07:57.890 --> 08:02.759
No. You stay here
until you're clean. For Jessica.

08:04.310 --> 08:06.050
I could just show this around. It's--

08:06.650 --> 08:07.890
No, I got it. Thanks.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.970
[Tony] Fuck me. Fuck.

08:12.490 --> 08:13.525
Wait...

08:14.320 --> 08:16.561
He's my babysitter?
What happened to Sheri?

08:16.870 --> 08:20.613
Sheri couldn't skip twice in a row.
She's taking the evening shift.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.115
I thought he wanted nothing to do with me.

08:23.410 --> 08:24.320
No, I don't.

08:24.710 --> 08:27.122
So keep your mouth shut
and don't piss me off.

08:27.210 --> 08:28.996
Don't piss me off.

08:29.090 --> 08:32.048
And if you puke on this leather,
I'm gonna have to kick your ass.

08:32.300 --> 08:33.119
Great.

08:33.720 --> 08:38.589
So, WebMD detox info and contingency plans
are on the desk.

08:38.680 --> 08:42.343
Don't let anyone see you. And I gotta go.

08:42.430 --> 08:45.809
Um, have fun.
Don't kill each other. Thanks.

08:46.650 --> 08:47.605
[Clay] Bye.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.568
[Ryan] But, as is almost always the case
in high school,

08:51.650 --> 08:53.481
we mock what we don't understand.

08:53.570 --> 08:55.310
That's what kids at Liberty did to Hannah.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.480
[Dennis] What about faculty?

08:56.610 --> 09:00.728
I mean, didn't they express concern
over the poem's suicidal contents?

09:00.870 --> 09:04.283
The poem was read aloud
in Mrs. Cusick's class. That's about it.

09:04.580 --> 09:06.207
So no one addressed

09:06.290 --> 09:09.748
the anonymous author's
obvious cry for help

09:09.840 --> 09:12.411
or asked you who wrote it?

09:12.710 --> 09:14.291
Nope. No one took it seriously.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.467
But then again, they rarely do.

09:22.060 --> 09:23.425
["Maniac" playing]

09:23.720 --> 09:28.089
We hit the big time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

09:28.190 --> 09:30.818
I'm such a maniac
You're such a maniac

09:30.900 --> 09:33.721
We're fuckin' maniacs
We're fuckIn' maniacs

09:33.820 --> 09:35.811
Ooh

09:36.860 --> 09:37.849
[Mr. Porter] Mr. Down?

09:37.950 --> 09:40.737
The city of night
Is the city of fools...

09:42.740 --> 09:44.696
My office, now.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.756
I think you know why you're here.

10:01.430 --> 10:02.249
Yeah, I'm aware.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.606
You wanna tell me about these?

10:12.400 --> 10:14.061
Wait, that's what this is about?

10:14.650 --> 10:16.186
You took the pictures.

10:17.110 --> 10:19.101
Yeah, last year.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.441
How'd they end up saying, "drunk slut"?

10:23.120 --> 10:24.690
Mr. Porter, I didn't do that.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.076
I went into the photography classroom,

10:27.160 --> 10:30.072
and the printer history in the lab
said that you were signed in.

10:30.290 --> 10:33.532
Someone _must've used it while
I was developing In the darkroom then.

10:33.630 --> 10:34.449
Okay.

10:34.920 --> 10:35.750
[scoffs]

10:35.840 --> 10:38.912
So do we know who might be doing this
to Jessica, then?

10:39.840 --> 10:43.003
Same person who smashed my camera.
Did anyone ever find them?

10:43.970 --> 10:45.710
But Jessica and I get messed with?

10:46.020 --> 10:48.227
And the people that deserve
to get messed with never do.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.840
I think that can change.

10:50.020 --> 10:51.556
I'll believe it when I see it.

10:52.020 --> 10:54.147
[indistinct chattering]

11:06.160 --> 11:09.459
Isn't this, like,
your special resources period?

11:09.830 --> 11:13.414
Yeah, I hate that shit.
I just-- I gotta listen to these again.

11:15.920 --> 11:16.955
Alex, uh...

11:20.260 --> 11:22.637
last time, you listened,
I think, multiple times.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.176
Yeah, I know. I just...

11:25.050 --> 11:28.269
I keep listening to mine over and over
because it doesn't make sense.

11:29.270 --> 11:30.726
It's like I'm missing something.

11:33.190 --> 11:34.054
Do you...

11:35.060 --> 11:36.186
Do you wanna talk about it?

11:36.860 --> 11:39.397
-Aren't we talking about it?
-I guess so.

11:46.370 --> 11:47.985
[Clay] Hey, what is that guy doing?

11:48.370 --> 11:50.031
[Alex] Uh, chalking the field.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.036
What is that machine?

11:52.500 --> 11:55.492
[Alex] I don't know.
Like... I guess it's a chalk machine?

11:56.960 --> 11:57.790
I gotta go.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.006
I don't know
if it's called a chalk machine.

12:00.090 --> 12:01.159
No, Ijust...

12:02.470 --> 12:05.928
-Look, don't listen too hard, okay?
-Yeah.

12:25.450 --> 12:28.328
[Hannah] It seems like nothing
until the hurricane hits.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.360
Is that why you did it, Alex?

12:36.670 --> 12:39.377
[Ryan] I can't pretend to know
what goes on in someone else's head.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.006
It's poetry.

12:41.090 --> 12:44.002
Most of the poets in our group
write about dark and messed-up things.

12:44.090 --> 12:48.595
So you had no idea that Hannah
was crying out for help in her work,

12:48.680 --> 12:50.671
or so the prosecution
would have us believe,

12:50.760 --> 12:53.888
but you expect the school
to draw that conclusion?

12:53.980 --> 12:55.550
[Ryan] It's their job, isn't it?

12:56.400 --> 12:58.857
I mean, I'm sorry,
but I'm not a licensed therapist,

12:58.940 --> 12:59.850
or a teacher.

13:00.270 --> 13:03.319
Ryan, isn't it true that you worked
with Hannah

13:03.400 --> 13:05.106
on many of her other poems?

13:05.650 --> 13:07.311
Some, yes.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.828
And do you recognize these?

13:16.920 --> 13:19.457
Yes, they're other poems
from Hannah's journals.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.581
Defense Exhibit F, Your Honor.

13:21.670 --> 13:24.628
Uh, Ryan, did you work with Hannah
on this poem?

13:25.130 --> 13:26.290
Yes, I did.

13:27.180 --> 13:29.216
Would you read this poem
for the court, please?

13:36.560 --> 13:39.267
"Oh, fruit forbidden,
so sour, so sweet..."

13:39.560 --> 13:41.471
[Hannah]
"I have been banished from the garden,

13:41.570 --> 13:42.855
and I don't thinkI miss it.

13:43.650 --> 13:45.561
And yet I want another bite."

13:45.650 --> 13:47.652
[pop music playing softly over speakers]

13:48.570 --> 13:50.731
I like how you subverted the ode.
That's good.

13:52.030 --> 13:53.907
Some obvious metaphors there,

13:55.330 --> 13:57.207
but there's a universality to it.

13:58.670 --> 13:59.910
-I'm just--
-[cell phone pings]

14:01.500 --> 14:02.660
Sorry, uh, keep going.

14:03.380 --> 14:07.009
I was going to say, I'm just wondering
if you shouldn't delve a little deeper.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.790
You had another you wanted to read?

14:08.880 --> 14:09.756
-Uh...
-[phone pings]

14:09.840 --> 14:11.000
-Yeah.
-Okay.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.968
Look, I know it seems silly,
but the no-phone rule is for a very good--

14:19.810 --> 14:21.220
Justin Foley?

14:23.230 --> 14:24.436
Shut up. Are--?

14:26.990 --> 14:27.888
Hang on.

14:28.740 --> 14:30.526
Holy shit.

14:30.610 --> 14:32.737
-He's your forbidden fruit?
-No, he's not.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.980
-We just text sometimes.
-Oh, you text?

14:35.370 --> 14:37.361
And talk on the phone a little.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.280
-Since when?
-I don't know.

14:39.370 --> 14:41.668
He texted me that day saying he was sorry,

14:41.750 --> 14:44.799
and then, again, the next day.
Eventually, I stopped ignoring him.

14:45.300 --> 14:48.042
And it felt good to know that things
didn't end up the way

14:48.130 --> 14:50.007
-that people think they did.
-What--?

14:50.630 --> 14:53.463
-You just told me to delve deeper.
-Not into him.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.847
-You said yourself he ruined you.
-I know.

14:56.640 --> 14:59.097
-I know, I just...
-Okay. I get it.

14:59.770 --> 15:01.055
He makes all our panties drop.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.266
Wait, you think Justin's hot?

15:03.360 --> 15:06.477
Of course I do. I'm not blind,
or, like, chemically castrated.

15:06.820 --> 15:08.526
You said, and I'm quoting,

15:08.610 --> 15:11.943
that he was "the exemplar
of athleticus douchebaggerus."

15:12.030 --> 15:13.566
Which only makes him hotter.

15:13.820 --> 15:16.823
-I know, right? How is that even fair?
-All right, enough.

15:17.370 --> 15:20.203
You put your hand on the hot stove.
Owie! You've learned your lesson.

15:21.370 --> 15:23.031
-Yes?
-Yes.

15:25.380 --> 15:26.244
[chuckles]

15:26.340 --> 15:28.456
You are going to delete him
from your phone...

15:28.550 --> 15:30.666
-Ugh.
-...and cleanse him from your heart.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.251
Well, we should probably skip
my next three poems.

15:33.930 --> 15:35.249
-[chuckling]
-Why?

15:36.310 --> 15:37.129
[sighs]

15:39.930 --> 15:41.340
"It was the smile that did it first.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.477
The way it seemed so easy for you
to be so happy.

15:45.980 --> 15:48.278
That smile I wish I'd never seen."

15:48.360 --> 15:49.679
-Stop it.
-[chuckles]

15:52.820 --> 15:55.311
And do you know
who this poem is about, Ryan?

15:55.950 --> 15:58.612
-Objection. Hearsay.
-Declarant unavailable, Your Honor.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.953
-[judge] I'll allow it.
-And who is this poem about, Ryan?

16:07.170 --> 16:08.080
I don't know.

16:09.250 --> 16:10.160
Hmm.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.921
Ryan, why don't you read
another poem for us?

16:14.470 --> 16:16.961
[Tyler] Fucking Ryan Shaver.

16:17.640 --> 16:21.019
Every single kid who's gone to court
has completely skated.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.808
No one has admitted what they did.
It's just me. I'm the only one.

16:27.110 --> 16:30.773
-Yeah, that Ryan's a fucking tool.
-Worst kind of gay.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.908
I mean, I didn't mean that
because he's gay.

16:36.990 --> 16:37.866
Oh, I did.

16:37.950 --> 16:41.943
He's fucking shallow and pretentious,
and he fucking dresses gay every day.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.359
[exhales] Classic homo.

16:45.040 --> 16:48.123
Chad's also gay, FYI.

16:48.210 --> 16:50.121
Hence, he can say shit
the rest of us can't.

16:52.340 --> 16:54.626
And if you ever want to fuck with him,

16:55.840 --> 16:56.966
there's an app for that.

17:05.100 --> 17:07.148
I raised you three rectangular ones.

17:10.940 --> 17:13.818
If I win, we get to go outside.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.390
-No.
-Come on, just for a walk.

17:15.490 --> 17:17.651
No. I'm sorry.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.309
You heard the bossman.

17:19.780 --> 17:22.613
Besides, you got people looking for you
on both sides of the law.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.038
Since when is Tony Padilla
afraid of shit like that?

17:33.170 --> 17:34.125
Holy shit.

17:36.090 --> 17:37.079
You are scared.

17:38.510 --> 17:39.465
Why?

17:55.570 --> 17:57.561
My brothers and I, we beat this guy up.

17:58.110 --> 18:01.079
He ended up pressing charges
a few weeks later.

18:01.660 --> 18:04.072
That was my second strike,
now I'm on probation.

18:05.790 --> 18:08.668
If I get seen with you, we get busted,

18:10.130 --> 18:12.951
that means number three,
that means I do time.

18:16.130 --> 18:17.165
Shit.

18:19.970 --> 18:20.789
[Justin sniffing]

18:23.510 --> 18:25.137
What the fuck happened to you?

18:26.560 --> 18:28.801
-You don't gotta tell me.
-No, no, no. It's...

18:31.730 --> 18:32.810
It's cool. It's...

18:34.530 --> 18:38.352
I just basically blew through
most of my money

18:38.450 --> 18:40.441
the first few weeks I was out,

18:40.860 --> 18:42.657
living in, like, motels and shit.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.288
Yeah, ow was like
taking the edge off, but...

18:48.460 --> 18:50.325
all these pills are so pricey, and...

18:51.920 --> 18:53.080
heroin's cheap.

18:55.710 --> 18:56.836
So you know, here I am.

19:00.220 --> 19:02.677
Shitting myself in Clay Jensen's bathroom.

19:10.810 --> 19:12.141
Put your fucking shoes on.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.851
So your parents weren't pissed
about yesterday?

19:20.700 --> 19:23.112
No. They were disappointed.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.237
Oh, disappointed. I hate that shit.

19:27.330 --> 19:30.788
Plus, they want me to go to group therapy,
talk to someone.

19:32.210 --> 19:34.781
-You can always talk to me.
-That's what I said.

19:35.710 --> 19:41.125
Yeah, I won't, um, try to kiss you
every time or anything. [scoffs]

19:41.720 --> 19:42.675
Yeah.

19:44.260 --> 19:45.386
About that, I, uh...

19:45.470 --> 19:48.268
[stammers] No, I mean, we don't have to...

19:49.180 --> 19:52.308
We don't have to be about that,
you know, ever again, so...

19:53.650 --> 19:54.548
Okay.

19:55.770 --> 19:56.816
Thanks.

19:59.530 --> 20:00.895
I listened to the tapes.

20:01.820 --> 20:03.310
Clay finally gave them to me.

20:05.570 --> 20:06.446
Jesus.

20:09.540 --> 20:10.529
Are you...

20:10.910 --> 20:13.071
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

20:14.040 --> 20:14.995
Are you?

20:16.420 --> 20:18.706
You never told me
the whole story about Bryce.

20:19.250 --> 20:22.003
If I wanted to talk about that,
I'd go to stupid group therapy.

20:23.090 --> 20:23.966
Okay.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.078
Yeah, I get it.

20:26.510 --> 20:28.558
I don't even know the whole story myself.

20:29.640 --> 20:33.883
-I don't remember all of it.
-Yeah, me neither.

20:37.810 --> 20:38.856
[Clay] Here we go.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.734
I think I saw one of those
chalk machine things in here somewhere.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.156
Which would mean?

20:47.200 --> 20:48.610
The pictures were taken at school.

20:49.530 --> 20:50.360
And?

20:51.500 --> 20:53.070
It would be huge for your case.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.569
And?

21:02.260 --> 21:04.160
And holy shit, there it is.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.395
We gotta find that room.

21:19.770 --> 21:22.147
[Ryan] "Do I put that target on my back
again and again?

21:22.530 --> 21:25.943
Or do I face a lifetime
of wanting the thing I should not have?"

21:26.820 --> 21:29.448
[Sonya] You've read three poems now,
so I'll ask you again,

21:30.410 --> 21:31.866
who were these poems about?

21:31.950 --> 21:33.861
[Dennis] Objection. Asked and answered.

21:33.950 --> 21:36.418
'[Sonya] Your Honor?
-[judge] I'll allow it.

21:43.340 --> 21:44.750
Who's the poem about, Ryan?

21:47.970 --> 21:48.789
Justin Foley.

21:51.140 --> 21:55.224
So, after Justin Foley, in her own words,

21:55.560 --> 21:58.051
"ruined her and destroyed her reputation,"

21:58.150 --> 22:00.015
she maintained contact with him?

22:00.810 --> 22:01.720
Yes.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.989
-And kept writing poetry about him?
-Yes.

22:05.860 --> 22:08.943
[Sonya] Nearly a half-dozen poems.
Any further mention of depression

22:09.030 --> 22:10.486
or cries for help?

22:13.120 --> 22:13.939
No.

22:14.700 --> 22:15.826
And to your knowledge,

22:16.660 --> 22:20.323
did she maintain personal contact
with Justin Foley?

22:20.750 --> 22:21.580
I...

22:23.170 --> 22:24.125
I don't know.

22:25.380 --> 22:27.507
[rock music plays softly over speakers]

22:39.980 --> 22:41.607
Uh... hey.

22:41.690 --> 22:42.850
[chuckles]

22:42.940 --> 22:45.022
[stammers] You texted me you were here.

22:45.110 --> 22:47.681
Never thinking you would, like,
come visit.

22:47.990 --> 22:49.730
Yeah, well...

22:51.570 --> 22:53.868
-Did you just feel like a latte?
-[chuckles]

22:54.830 --> 22:57.037
Actually, do you think
they have Gatorade here?

22:57.120 --> 22:58.246
I'm guessing no.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.071
Yeah, I've actually never been in here.

23:02.500 --> 23:05.492
Well, neither have any of your friends,
so it's safe.

23:06.130 --> 23:07.040
That's not--

23:07.340 --> 23:08.159
Ijust...

23:11.640 --> 23:13.710
We haven't really talked
in a while, so I...

23:14.600 --> 23:17.216
I thought maybe I wanted to see you,
that's all.

23:17.310 --> 23:18.470
Well, you see me at school.

23:18.850 --> 23:20.681
Yeah, but you know how that is.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.010
I don't, really. How is it?

23:23.940 --> 23:25.510
Look, I don't fucking like it, either.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.733
But once you get tagged at Liberty,
that's what you've got.

23:30.070 --> 23:32.698
Your tag seems a little easier
to live with than mine.

23:32.780 --> 23:34.657
Look, I said I was sorry.

23:35.830 --> 23:37.445
I've been saying it for months.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.457
-Texting it, mostly.
-Well. ..

23:41.080 --> 23:42.536
-I am.
-[footsteps approaching]

23:44.380 --> 23:45.199
Sorry I'm late.

23:46.090 --> 23:48.661
-Why, hello, Justin.
-Uh, hey, hey. Wha...

23:49.460 --> 23:50.370
What's up?

23:51.840 --> 23:55.344
[Justin] Yeah, we were just finishing up
some homework stuff, so...

23:56.050 --> 23:58.928
-Yeah, I'll see you at school.
-Sure. Talk to you at school.

24:03.730 --> 24:06.142
Look, he just showed up.

24:06.230 --> 24:08.687
-Hmm.
-I didn't ask him to.

24:11.650 --> 24:12.526
I know.

24:13.450 --> 24:16.738
-Okay, I know. Leave me alone.
-Cleanse him, Hannah, cleanse.

24:17.330 --> 24:18.365
Cleanse.

24:19.080 --> 24:22.618
I mean, she wrote about longing,
about love and the lack of love.

24:22.910 --> 24:24.741
Why didn't you publish any of those poems?

24:24.830 --> 24:26.457
Because they weren't any good.

24:26.540 --> 24:27.837
[Sonya] Ryan, be honest.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.548
You published the poem you did
not because it was her truth,

24:30.630 --> 24:33.963
but because you thought
it would shock the most, didn't you?

24:39.560 --> 24:40.379
No.

24:41.930 --> 24:45.593
She wasn't happy.
She was extremely upset and hurting.

24:45.980 --> 24:49.268
She wrote about Justin and--
and other boys because she was lonely.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.602
It's not about them,
it's about what they represented.

24:55.780 --> 24:57.941
What they did to her
and what you're doing right--

24:58.030 --> 25:00.362
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Ryan.

25:00.450 --> 25:01.610
Redirect, Your Honor?

25:02.580 --> 25:06.539
Ryan, why do you think Hannah
continued texting with Justin?

25:08.170 --> 25:09.956
Justin Foley was a bad decision.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.449
And we all make bad decisions.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.671
Especially when we're desperately alone.

25:17.340 --> 25:19.672
-Yeah, I think we should head back now.
-No.

25:20.510 --> 25:21.761
It's so nice out.

25:22.310 --> 25:25.882
Some fresh air, some vitamin D.

25:25.980 --> 25:27.265
-Yeah.
-Some... some...

25:28.730 --> 25:30.015
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, come on.

25:30.110 --> 25:31.975
[retches]

25:32.070 --> 25:32.889
Shit.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.440
-Sorry.
-Jesus Christ, man.

25:37.530 --> 25:38.906
Don't fucking talk to people.

25:39.530 --> 25:42.863
I was just apologizing
to the purple tracksuit lady. It's...

25:43.540 --> 25:44.404
Ugh.

25:44.500 --> 25:47.321
I don't get
this whole secret agent routine.

25:47.420 --> 25:48.660
Oh, really, you don't get

25:48.750 --> 25:51.492
that there are some people
who might not be happy to have you back?

25:55.090 --> 25:56.580
Jessica wants me back.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.079
That's all that fucking matters.

26:00.300 --> 26:01.927
Yeah. Yeah.

26:02.930 --> 26:06.309
-Right? That's what she said, right?
-I didn't talk to her, Clay did.

26:07.850 --> 26:09.340
He said she wants me here.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.180
[rock music blaring over speakers]

26:11.900 --> 26:12.889
[Tony] I don't think...

26:13.530 --> 26:14.770
I don't think it's that simple.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.941
-I think she...
-What? What is it?

26:18.360 --> 26:19.657
Does that car look familiar?

26:20.450 --> 26:22.406
-[Justin] Whose is it?
-I don't know. Obviously,

26:22.490 --> 26:25.072
they go to our school.
So you got your wish.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.787
Everybody's gonna know you're back.

26:28.710 --> 26:30.450
-[car honking]
-[indistinct chattering]

26:33.250 --> 26:35.582
-I'm glad you came.
-[Andy] Me, too.

26:36.510 --> 26:39.252
-That was a lot to take.
-Oh, today was a good day.

26:40.180 --> 26:42.091
It can get much worse, believe me.

26:42.930 --> 26:43.840
I believe you.

26:44.760 --> 26:45.636
See you tomorrow.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.761
It's nice seeing you two together.

26:54.270 --> 26:57.068
-Nice for the jury, too, right?
-That's not what I'm thinking.

26:57.150 --> 27:00.449
-Well, I am.
-Okay, I understand.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.327
I'm worried about you, though.

27:04.910 --> 27:07.151
It's easy to fall into old patterns,

27:07.910 --> 27:11.073
to rely on someone
who has proven unreliable.

27:13.790 --> 27:14.745
Don't worry.

27:16.170 --> 27:17.250
I've moved on.

27:18.840 --> 27:21.798
[Ryan] A lot of us keep holding on
even when we should let go.

27:31.640 --> 27:33.858
-Shit.
-[Hannah] Floors don't match.

27:35.230 --> 27:36.686
[sighs] No couch.

27:37.780 --> 27:38.599
Damn it.

27:39.150 --> 27:41.903
There has to be
some athletics room somewhere.

27:42.780 --> 27:43.906
Maybe Justin could help.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.030
You would say that.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.326
What does that mean?

27:52.540 --> 27:55.839
-How are you so quick to forgive him?
-I didn't say I forgave him.

27:55.920 --> 27:59.253
Why do girls even like guys like Justin?
I mean, why did you?

27:59.760 --> 28:02.547
He's always been an asshole.
His best friend is a rapist.

28:02.630 --> 28:04.040
I didn't know that then.

28:05.260 --> 28:06.249
You were warned.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.801
-Kat warned you.
-Oh, so it's my fault?

28:10.850 --> 28:13.683
-I'm not saying that.
-What are you saying, then?

28:15.310 --> 28:16.140
Ijust...

28:19.360 --> 28:22.488
I don't understand why people love people
who aren't good for them.

28:23.030 --> 28:24.236
I don't know what to tell you.

28:25.450 --> 28:27.441
We don't choose who we fall for.

28:30.450 --> 28:31.280
Yeah.

28:33.710 --> 28:34.699
Tell me about it.

28:59.980 --> 29:01.220
You sure it was Justin?

29:01.320 --> 29:03.060
[scoffs] That's what I heard.

29:03.150 --> 29:05.527
Why would he be with Tony?
Think he came back to testify?

29:05.780 --> 29:08.988
-Fuck if I know, or care.
-[coach] All right, listen up.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.407
State guy's coming down tomorrow
to do the screens.

29:15.210 --> 29:17.280
So if that is a concern for you,

29:17.750 --> 29:18.990
see me in my office.

29:19.880 --> 29:20.699
Hey.

29:21.800 --> 29:24.587
You all set for tomorrow? For court?
You want me to come With you?

29:24.670 --> 29:26.968
That's all right, Coach. But thanks.

29:29.350 --> 29:31.090
[Montgomery]
Think that's why he came back?

29:31.180 --> 29:32.636
[Bryce] I don't know. Drop it.

29:33.060 --> 29:33.924
[Montgomery scoffs]

29:34.020 --> 29:35.726
Go. Everything's fine.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.845
Yeah, you keep saying that.

29:38.270 --> 29:40.761
You tell me you've got shit
taken care of, but I don't see it.

29:41.730 --> 29:44.733
-And why the fuck do you care, exactly?
-[scoffs]

29:45.240 --> 29:47.811
You, man. Us. State.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.269
All taken care of.

29:51.030 --> 29:53.032
Go. Get your synthetic pee.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.115
Zachy, you coming?

29:57.330 --> 29:59.161
No, I'm good, brother. Don't need it.

29:59.250 --> 30:00.660
Not gonna tell on us, are you?

30:01.710 --> 30:03.120
Why, you think I'm a rat?

30:04.210 --> 30:08.044
No, of course not.
I just wish I had your genes, man.

30:09.430 --> 30:11.136
-You did all right.
-[laughs]

30:11.220 --> 30:12.209
You flatter me.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.346
[Zach] Got your back, brother.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.056
-Thanks, buddy.
-Yeah.

30:24.230 --> 30:25.106
Thanks, ladies.

30:25.820 --> 30:26.980
I'm probably overthinking it,

30:27.070 --> 30:30.028
but not every girl
gets to meet the parents, right?

30:30.110 --> 30:31.941
-True. Later, girl.
-Bye.

30:32.660 --> 30:33.695
Hey, Jess.

30:34.790 --> 30:37.031
-Great work today.
-Thanks.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.200
Sorry we had to end early.

30:38.410 --> 30:40.913
I have to go home and change
for dinner with Bryce's parents.

30:41.750 --> 30:44.492
-I have no idea what I'm gonna wear.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.673
I'm sure you could wear anything, Chle,
and they'll still love you.

30:49.800 --> 30:50.630
Hey, Jess.

30:51.390 --> 30:54.348
We'll find you a man, okay?
You just have to let me help you.

30:54.680 --> 30:57.592
I mean it.
I kinda pride myself on my matchmaking--

30:57.680 --> 31:00.342
Look, Chle,
I don't want a fucking boyfriend.

31:00.440 --> 31:01.259
Okay?

31:02.480 --> 31:07.235
The last thing I need in my life right now
is some fucking guy.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.108
And you, the fact that you keep,
like, offering that...

31:12.700 --> 31:15.191
means you're just as fucking clueless
as I thought.

31:22.040 --> 31:22.870
[doorbell rings]

31:24.710 --> 31:26.450
[Ryan] Iwas trying
to be Hannah's friend.

31:27.550 --> 31:29.871
I needed a friend as much as she did.

31:33.050 --> 31:35.041
Um. Hi.

31:37.220 --> 31:38.050
Hi.

31:38.140 --> 31:38.970
I, um...

31:40.060 --> 31:43.143
I was friends with Hannah,
and I let her down, and I'm sorry.

31:43.730 --> 31:46.688
I just wanted to come by and say
what they're doing to her is bullshit.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.099
Thank you.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.149
Can I...?

31:55.870 --> 31:58.282
Can I ask you some questions
about Hannah's journals?

32:00.080 --> 32:00.899
Oh, um...

32:03.670 --> 32:05.206
Yes, of course.

32:14.430 --> 32:17.922
[Olivia] She mentions "the clubhouse"
in three different poems.

32:19.640 --> 32:22.302
"Something changed after the clubhouse.

32:23.770 --> 32:25.852
I imagined myself for a moment
one of the elite,

32:25.940 --> 32:28.352
but I never should have gone
to the clubhouse."

32:28.570 --> 32:30.356
"...in his lucky letter jacket."

32:30.440 --> 32:33.898
-That's gotta be Justin, right?
-It could be.

32:34.660 --> 32:35.479
I don't know.

32:36.910 --> 32:38.730
I don't remember anything
about a clubhouse.

32:38.830 --> 32:39.649
Damn it.

32:40.580 --> 32:44.118
Okay. What about "the intruder"?

32:45.210 --> 32:48.998
He comes up several times, too.
There's a whole poem about him.

32:49.420 --> 32:52.253
"Sometimes the intruder
doesn't need to break a window.

32:52.630 --> 32:54.586
Sometimes they already have the key."

32:55.430 --> 32:56.499
Do you know this one?

32:57.430 --> 32:58.249
No.

32:59.970 --> 33:01.926
I think it's about the bullying
at the school.

33:03.310 --> 33:04.720
The house is on fire,

33:05.560 --> 33:07.266
her lungs are filling up with smoke,

33:07.360 --> 33:08.759
and the intruder,

33:09.110 --> 33:12.432
it's this other Hannah
that everyone thought they knew.

33:12.530 --> 33:13.895
Oh, no, that makes sense.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.400
[Hannah groans]

33:23.500 --> 33:24.956
It's fucking useless, Ryan.

33:25.290 --> 33:29.169
We write and write about shit,
and nothing ever changes. I'm done.

33:29.590 --> 33:32.332
Hannah, you have a gift.
Not gonna let you throw that away.

33:32.840 --> 33:33.659
A gift?

33:34.260 --> 33:37.081
-You say that so easily like you know.
-I do.

33:37.180 --> 33:38.499
Yeah, well,Iwish I did.

33:39.260 --> 33:41.216
I wish I didn't need people
to tell me I'm good,

33:41.310 --> 33:43.767
or that they like me, but I do.

33:44.270 --> 33:47.228
That-- That's great stuff.
That's what you should write about.

33:47.310 --> 33:48.140
No.

33:48.230 --> 33:50.937
Enough writing about my emotions.
Can we just eat them?

33:51.020 --> 33:53.523
[chuckles] Yeah, we can totally eat them.

33:55.610 --> 33:57.817
[exhales] Vanilla or mint chocolate chip?

33:58.360 --> 34:01.329
Please. Vanilla is not a flavor.
It's an admission of defeat.

34:01.410 --> 34:03.480
-["Tinseltown Swimming in Blood" playing]
-[chuckles]

34:03.580 --> 34:05.070
I was blind

34:06.250 --> 34:08.286
Off in the corner doing poet's work...

34:08.370 --> 34:11.669
[Ryan] Hannah was so talented,
but she didn't know it.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.580
It was just a dream...

34:13.710 --> 34:15.837
[Ryan] She wrote out of love, out of need.

34:18.340 --> 34:19.887
I couldn't see...

34:20.850 --> 34:23.762
[Ryan] And I wanted to show her
that the rush of people loving your work

34:23.850 --> 34:25.260
is just as good as love.

34:25.640 --> 34:28.382
Doing poet's work
That's all right for now

34:28.520 --> 34:31.353
-[Ryan] So I stole her poem.
- It was just a dream

34:31.440 --> 34:33.681
Of your blue eyes

34:37.030 --> 34:38.850
Tinseltown dripping in blood

34:38.950 --> 34:40.520
[Ryan] It was just one poem.

34:41.570 --> 34:43.822
[song echoes, fading]

34:48.870 --> 34:49.700
But I was wrong.

34:50.540 --> 34:52.531
I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.

34:54.710 --> 35:01.172
Sometimes _I fantasize that all the answers
are In these torn-out pages.

35:01.640 --> 35:04.427
Oh, I-- I don't think so, I... [chuckles]

35:06.520 --> 35:08.670
I imagine those are just
false starts or...

35:09.810 --> 35:13.394
things she was ashamed
to even admit to herself.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.561
Why did she keep in contact with Justin?

35:17.400 --> 35:18.310
Loneliness.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.981
It can be intense at our age.

35:23.030 --> 35:24.406
It's not just at your age.

35:33.880 --> 35:34.869
Human connection.

35:40.090 --> 35:40.920
[chimes]

36:02.780 --> 36:07.194
You didn't quit cheerleading
because Justin's back?

36:10.450 --> 36:12.532
I know, news travels fast in these halls.

36:13.370 --> 36:14.246
Don't care.

36:14.460 --> 36:16.496
-You don't careN that he's back?
- o.

36:16.790 --> 36:17.870
Know where he's staying?

36:21.300 --> 36:22.585
Justin needs help, too.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.000
He should be enrolled in school.

36:26.390 --> 36:30.133
The only address I have of him
is his dad in Sacramento.

36:32.980 --> 36:33.799
Oh, well.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.892
Jess, I'll be honest.

36:38.770 --> 36:42.319
I know what it's like to try to be strong

36:43.070 --> 36:44.810
and keep your problems all to you.

36:45.780 --> 36:46.860
But it does not work.

36:49.580 --> 36:50.990
You don't have to talk to me.

36:53.460 --> 36:54.996
But talk to someone.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.082
If I don't have to talk to you, can I go?

37:07.140 --> 37:08.505
Justin's never met his dad.

37:10.140 --> 37:12.597
His mom lives with some drug dealer
named Seth.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.076
-Do you think she likes her?
-Your mother?

37:30.160 --> 37:31.536
-Yeah.
-Uh, sure.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.911
Chle's a great girl. Very pretty.

37:37.330 --> 37:40.458
Yeah, she's got a brain, too.
Her grades are better than mine.

37:40.710 --> 37:41.916
[chuckles]

37:42.210 --> 37:43.086
And she's loyal?

37:44.800 --> 37:45.710
Yeah.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.170
That's important.

37:48.550 --> 37:51.053
-You did good.
-Thanks, Dad.

37:52.680 --> 37:53.590
Here we go.

37:55.350 --> 37:56.260
Wow.

37:57.560 --> 37:59.801
You seem quite happy, the two of you.

37:59.900 --> 38:03.939
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
He's so sweet to me, like, all the time.

38:04.030 --> 38:05.179
-Sweet?
-Yeah.

38:05.900 --> 38:07.811
-That's good to hear.
-[chuckles]

38:17.000 --> 38:19.457
Oh. Cheerleading. Full-contact sport.

38:20.880 --> 38:21.869
I see.

38:23.750 --> 38:25.911
[soft laughter]

38:26.010 --> 38:27.216
How do you know about Justin?

38:27.840 --> 38:30.547
Because Jessica told me
when we ditched With your car yesterday.

38:31.470 --> 38:32.926
Said that Clay went and found him.

38:33.760 --> 38:34.920
-Clay?
-Yeah.

38:36.230 --> 38:39.643
Okay, do you know anything about
where he's living or why he's back?

38:39.730 --> 38:42.358
No, Zach, and I really don't fucking care.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.601
Why is everything always
about fucking Justin?

38:44.690 --> 38:47.648
-Whoa. Relax, dude. It's not.
-[sighs]

38:49.530 --> 38:52.943
-Hey, are you okay?
-Yeah.

38:53.410 --> 38:55.071
Jessica and I kissed yesterday.

38:56.580 --> 38:57.490
Seriously?

38:57.960 --> 38:59.700
Dude, that's... that's great.

39:01.210 --> 39:02.029
Is that great?

39:02.960 --> 39:05.201
Yeah, well,
but then she freaked out on me.

39:06.380 --> 39:08.621
And now it's just...
It's totally weird. I...

39:10.380 --> 39:12.792
Yeah, that makes sense
that she would freak out.

39:13.600 --> 39:17.172
Yeah. But I just... I still think
it has something to do with Justin.

39:18.230 --> 39:20.130
And you know what's the most fucked up?

39:21.440 --> 39:23.806
When we kissed,
I couldn't even feel anything.

39:25.610 --> 39:29.194
-You mean, like, emotionally, or...?
-No, like, down there.

39:29.900 --> 39:30.946
I was just numb.

39:32.990 --> 39:35.652
I haven't really felt anything,
like, post-coma.

39:36.870 --> 39:39.657
-Have you tried porn?
-Yeah, of course I've tried porn.

39:39.750 --> 39:42.287
But I thought with a real person,
maybe it would, you know.

39:43.540 --> 39:48.204
Yeah. Well, dude, honestly, it'll happen.
You just gotta find the right girl.

39:48.800 --> 39:49.789
-Yea h?
-Yeah.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.507
All right, well, let me know
when you find yours.

39:53.550 --> 39:56.428
Maybe she's got a friend
who's into scrawny and broken.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.056
Well, not broken forever.

40:00.270 --> 40:01.225
Let's go. Come on.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.469
[sighs]

40:07.020 --> 40:08.396
[Lainie] I'm sorry, Sheri.

40:08.570 --> 40:10.731
He went to the movies with his dad.

40:11.490 --> 40:15.733
-He must have forgotten to text you.
-Yeah, he must have.

40:16.830 --> 40:21.529
I'm happy that you two are friends again.
I know you've been through a great deal.

40:21.910 --> 40:23.366
Yeah, we have.

40:23.920 --> 40:26.377
I think Clay's still working
on trying to forgive me.

40:26.920 --> 40:30.162
-Well, if he asked you to come study...
-Yeah.

40:30.760 --> 40:33.126
Actually, why don't you stay?
Wait for him.

40:33.970 --> 40:34.789
Sure.

40:40.180 --> 40:42.887
Can I ask you a question
for a case that I'm working on?

40:44.900 --> 40:49.189
Let's say a boy and a girl, uh,
have been texting a lot,

40:49.780 --> 40:53.602
and then all of a sudden, it stops,
what would that mean?

40:54.410 --> 40:57.482
Well, they were probably dating, right?
Then they broke up.

40:57.580 --> 40:58.865
What if they never dated?

40:59.200 --> 41:02.033
Oh. That's probably just a hookup.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.628
[Ryan] Hannah was desperate
for human connection,

41:06.920 --> 41:08.490
and I betrayed her.

41:08.590 --> 41:10.581
["Will You Be By Me" playing]

41:12.010 --> 41:14.752
I guess I left her even more lonely
than she was before.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.426
And I guess I know how she feels.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.806
When the diction starts

41:23.890 --> 41:25.187
[chuckles]

41:25.270 --> 41:27.807
And it breaks my heart

41:29.400 --> 41:32.278
Will you be by me

41:37.240 --> 41:40.118
If my heart would fail...

41:41.740 --> 41:42.786
How'd it go today?

41:42.910 --> 41:45.913
Um. Not great, actually.

41:46.420 --> 41:48.570
You're fine.
I didn't say anything, if you're worried.

41:48.670 --> 41:52.583
I wasn't. I... just wanted to know
how you were doing.

41:53.960 --> 41:54.870
Are you here alone?

41:56.760 --> 41:58.887
-You wanna join us?
'"USH?

42:00.260 --> 42:03.093
Caleb, Ryan. Ryan, Caleb.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.420
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice...

42:06.600 --> 42:08.306
handshake, wow. [chuckles]

42:08.980 --> 42:10.936
[chuckles] Sure you don't wanna join us?

42:12.270 --> 42:14.898
Yeah, actually, no, I was just leaving.
I got stood up.

42:15.030 --> 42:18.568
Apparently, my date joined the app today.
He's a noob, so you know. Just...

42:18.910 --> 42:19.729
Um...

42:19.950 --> 42:23.442
Forget him. Stay.
Plus I want some dirt on Mr. Perfect here.

42:23.740 --> 42:26.709
-Oh, he knows about our past, that's--
-Barely any of it.

42:27.290 --> 42:29.417
[Tony] You're not interested
in high school bullshit.

42:29.500 --> 42:31.741
[Caleb] If it's about you, I am.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.837
Come on, Ryan. Seriously. Stay.

42:38.880 --> 42:42.464
[Ryan] What Hannah needed was a friend,
and I wasn't that.

42:44.850 --> 42:48.263
[woman] For the longest time,
nothing was the same.

42:49.230 --> 42:52.768
How long I slept, what I ate, what I wore.

42:55.110 --> 42:57.271
I mean, my clothes
didn't feel like me anymore.

42:57.780 --> 42:59.520
Bright colors made me feel like a fraud

42:59.610 --> 43:01.942
and my black clothes
didn't seem dark enough, and...

43:02.200 --> 43:05.784
Just nothing seemed to fit.
Just literally everything felt like a lie.

43:07.120 --> 43:10.749
And nothing I did seemed to help.
No drink, no drug.

43:12.380 --> 43:15.452
Well, I didn't actually try every drug,

43:15.550 --> 43:18.872
but let me tell you, weed just had me
crying and all in my feelings.

43:19.970 --> 43:22.928
You know, but the one thing
that did seem to help was all of you.

43:24.260 --> 43:25.841
And I'm thankful today that just...

43:27.060 --> 43:28.379
coming here and talking to you

43:28.480 --> 43:30.937
has been the thing
that's brought me back to who I am.

43:32.310 --> 43:34.972
You know, a loud, pushy, pain in the ass.

43:35.070 --> 43:36.526
[laughter]

43:37.740 --> 43:40.391
But you know you love me, and I love you.

43:42.620 --> 43:43.564
Thank you.

43:50.210 --> 43:51.245
Took you long enough.

43:55.000 --> 43:55.989
How did you know?

43:57.250 --> 43:58.251
About me.

43:58.630 --> 44:01.042
Um, I didn't.

44:01.630 --> 44:03.882
I just figured in case
those rumors were bullshit,

44:03.970 --> 44:06.256
which they obviously were,
that I'd be a friendly face.

44:07.430 --> 44:11.059
Friendly and slightly stalkerish?
[chuckles]

44:11.480 --> 44:13.345
I don't stalk. I lurk.

44:13.440 --> 44:15.761
-Oh, okay.
-And it worked, didn't it?

44:18.650 --> 44:20.186
Yeah. [laughs]

44:20.900 --> 44:22.652
-[metal music blaring]
- Wild and free

44:23.280 --> 44:24.565
- Wild and free
-[Mrs. Down] Ty?

44:24.660 --> 44:26.616
-[knocking on door]
- Wild and free

44:26.700 --> 44:28.281
-Honey?
-[knocking continues]

44:28.370 --> 44:29.496
Wild and free

44:30.410 --> 44:31.866
-Ty.
- In the heat of the summer

44:31.960 --> 44:33.951
- Better call out a plumber...
-Ty.

44:34.540 --> 44:35.700
Turn it down.

44:36.340 --> 44:38.160
-What?
-Turn the music down.

44:40.210 --> 44:41.211
[music fades]

44:41.800 --> 44:43.040
Hey, sorry, what?

44:43.470 --> 44:44.835
That's, um...

44:46.430 --> 44:47.920
some music.

44:48.810 --> 44:50.516
-It's punk.
-Oh.

44:52.850 --> 44:54.761
They sound angry.

44:54.940 --> 44:56.396
-They are.
-Oh.

44:57.560 --> 44:59.528
Okay. Uh...

45:01.360 --> 45:02.941
What are they so angry about?

45:04.450 --> 45:05.439
Everything.

45:06.990 --> 45:08.230
-I see.
-Yeah.

45:12.370 --> 45:15.419
Mr. Barbour called today.
From up the street.

45:16.290 --> 45:20.659
He said he saw you and your friend, Cyrus,
shooting guns on his property.

45:21.260 --> 45:24.218
What? Shooting guns?

45:25.720 --> 45:28.678
That wasn't me. I don't know, I--

45:28.760 --> 45:30.671
-That old guy's crazy, I guess.
-No.

45:31.060 --> 45:34.348
He said it was you. That's why
he called me and not the police.

45:37.940 --> 45:41.728
Oh, wait, does he mean...
does he mean Cyrus' BB gun?

45:42.440 --> 45:45.238
-Is that what he's talking about?
-A BB gun?

45:45.320 --> 45:48.562
It's like this old thing Cyrus has.
It's like a toy.

45:49.070 --> 45:50.196
You know, it's not real.

45:50.660 --> 45:53.242
-Maybe that's what he saw.
-Oh. Okay.

45:54.160 --> 45:55.036
Hmm.

45:55.120 --> 45:57.668
Still, you know how I feel
about guns of any kind.

45:57.750 --> 46:00.742
Yeah. No, I do, I do.
And I even... I told Cyrus that.

46:00.840 --> 46:03.798
Which is why we went to
Mr. Barbour's field to be extra careful.

46:04.260 --> 46:06.421
And did Cyrus give you that music?

46:07.130 --> 46:08.176
And that shirt?

46:09.850 --> 46:13.217
We made the shirts ourselves, you know.

46:13.520 --> 46:14.885
They're quite bold.

46:15.390 --> 46:17.893
I hope you save them
for the appropriate audience,

46:18.400 --> 46:19.469
and not school.

46:21.480 --> 46:22.970
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

46:25.780 --> 46:26.599
Okay.

46:28.530 --> 46:29.406
Well...

46:34.330 --> 46:36.400
-Don't stay up too late.
-I won't.

46:38.540 --> 46:39.780
-G'night. Love you.
-Good night.

46:50.340 --> 46:51.887
[slow music playing]

46:51.970 --> 46:53.676
Hey, there.

46:53.930 --> 46:54.806
Hi.

46:55.970 --> 46:58.848
[woman] I think there's something wrong
with your camera.

46:59.900 --> 47:02.050
Oh, yeah, it's broken, so...

47:02.810 --> 47:05.028
What's your name, cutie?

47:05.360 --> 47:06.179
Um...

47:07.240 --> 47:09.140
My name is Zach.

47:10.280 --> 47:13.329
Well, hi, Zach.

47:15.120 --> 47:19.409
If I can't see you,
how will I know how big and hard you are?

47:21.080 --> 47:22.160
Um...

47:22.250 --> 47:24.036
Well, I could describe myself.

47:24.960 --> 47:26.700
Yeah, I'm 6'3".

47:27.090 --> 47:29.411
I'm jacked 'cause I work out a lot.

47:30.010 --> 47:32.251
Sounds like a hot bod.

47:33.390 --> 47:34.846
You like this?

47:37.100 --> 47:40.684
-Yeah, I do like that.
-[woman] Mm-hmm.

47:42.480 --> 47:45.313
-Yeah, that's good.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.

47:48.740 --> 47:49.889
Mmm.

47:54.120 --> 47:55.860
Oh, God. [panting]

47:56.660 --> 48:00.323
Fuck! God damn it.

48:02.040 --> 48:04.497
What's wrong? You don't like?

48:04.880 --> 48:08.008
No. I mean, yes, I do, I... [sighs]

48:08.510 --> 48:11.673
No, I do like it.
It's not you, it's me. I just...

48:13.970 --> 48:15.130
I don't work.

48:17.390 --> 48:18.209
And I'm not...

48:18.930 --> 48:21.171
I'm not 6'3", I'm not jacked, I'm...

48:22.690 --> 48:26.899
I'm really skinny and funny-looking,
and my dick's broken.

48:28.150 --> 48:29.435
Okay. Um...

48:30.110 --> 48:32.817
Honey, how old are you?

48:34.280 --> 48:36.066
-Twenty-five.
- Uh-huh.

48:37.530 --> 48:39.361
Look, it's 18 or older.

48:40.200 --> 48:41.610
Sorry, kiddo.

48:49.250 --> 48:50.126
[sighs]

48:51.170 --> 48:53.297
I'm sorry. I didn't get your text message.

48:53.380 --> 48:56.213
The procedure is if you see the car,
you go through the window.

48:56.300 --> 48:57.961
Your whole family has the same car.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.880
-I thought it was you.
-Mine is smaller.

48:59.970 --> 49:00.925
Okay, anyways,

49:01.140 --> 49:03.688
I made an excuse to go to your room
and use your bathroom,

49:03.770 --> 49:06.682
so that Tony could leave,
and Justin's been asleep ever since.

49:07.440 --> 49:10.728
Well, at least he didn't get discovered.

49:11.780 --> 49:14.317
Yeah, um, about that...

49:17.160 --> 49:18.024
[door opens]

49:22.250 --> 49:23.990
When were you gonna tell me
someone saw you?

49:24.870 --> 49:26.826
When were you gonna tell me about Jess?

49:28.420 --> 49:29.660
I talked to Tony.

49:30.090 --> 49:33.048
-She doesn't want me here, does she?
-It's complicated.

49:33.130 --> 49:35.291
-You lied to me.
-No, I-- It's the truth.

49:35.380 --> 49:38.213
Jessica just... doesn't realize it yet.

49:38.300 --> 49:39.927
-[scoffs]
-She'll change her mind.

49:40.010 --> 49:42.058
You have to get sober, and she'll see.

49:42.140 --> 49:43.220
Fuck that.

49:45.310 --> 49:46.595
I'm wasting my time.

49:48.690 --> 49:50.066
She kept your postcard.

49:53.190 --> 49:54.430
It's how we found you.

49:56.110 --> 49:57.941
She kept it, Justin.

49:58.030 --> 50:00.237
"Nancy, I'll always love you. Sid."

50:01.830 --> 50:02.945
Why would she keep that?

50:07.920 --> 50:09.319
I really did love her.

50:09.420 --> 50:11.411
[soft pop song playing]

50:13.840 --> 50:14.659
So, stay.

50:22.760 --> 50:25.012
[Ryan] Do you wanna know why
Hannah wrote these poems?

50:26.770 --> 50:27.839
She was reaching out.

50:28.270 --> 50:31.057
She was desperate to be heard,
to connect.

50:34.190 --> 50:36.488
And people took that lifeline
and they twisted it.

50:38.990 --> 50:39.809
Hey, kiddo.

50:41.780 --> 50:43.407
-You okay?
-Yeah.

50:45.450 --> 50:46.860
Uh, I was...

50:48.420 --> 50:50.706
I was thinking
maybe I'd try to sleep in here tonight.

50:51.670 --> 50:52.489
Really?

50:55.840 --> 50:58.968
-That's wonderful.
-Yeah, well, it's fine.

51:01.890 --> 51:04.802
Do you want me to tuck you in,
or is that silly?

51:06.810 --> 51:07.799
Silly.

51:10.150 --> 51:11.094
[Jessica chuckles]

51:11.190 --> 51:13.260
[Ryan] They took her own story
away from her.

51:15.110 --> 51:16.179
[doorbell rings]

51:17.780 --> 51:19.350
And she fought to get it back.

51:26.120 --> 51:28.111
-Who are you?
-Kevin Porter.

51:28.460 --> 51:31.418
Guidance counselor at Liberty High.

51:31.580 --> 51:32.706
I'm looking for your son.

51:32.790 --> 51:34.792
Look, what can I tell you? He ran away.

51:35.170 --> 51:38.048
You don't wanna know how he's doing,
or is he alive, or--?

51:38.130 --> 51:41.042
He can take care of himself, okay?
Always has.

51:41.130 --> 51:43.598
-Ma'am, he's 17 years old.
-[car door slams]

51:44.220 --> 51:45.380
[Seth] Who the fuck are you?

51:48.230 --> 51:52.678
I'm Justin's guidance counselor,
Kevin Porter. And you are?

51:53.060 --> 51:55.893
I'm the one that punk
stole a thousand dollars from.

51:56.400 --> 51:57.970
So you gonna get me my money back?

51:58.440 --> 52:00.442
Well, I'm not really here for that.

52:00.530 --> 52:03.317
Then I suggest
you get the fuck off my property.

52:04.530 --> 52:06.942
Listen. Justin, he needs a home.

52:07.620 --> 52:11.112
Well, he had a home, and he fucked it up.
Case closed.

52:11.210 --> 52:13.531
-Goodbye.
-Okay, I wish you would back off.

52:13.830 --> 52:14.910
[chuckles]

52:15.000 --> 52:16.661
-Or what?
-Don't do that, man.

52:17.500 --> 52:19.161
You gonna give me detention, huh?

52:20.840 --> 52:21.670
[grunts]

52:22.720 --> 52:24.130
Ah! Come on!

52:26.010 --> 52:27.807
[grunts]

52:31.730 --> 52:32.845
[Ryan] But in the end,

52:32.940 --> 52:35.932
the story they told was so loud
that it's all that she could hear...

52:37.230 --> 52:40.563
and she started to believe it
and forgot who she was.

52:45.410 --> 52:46.365
Fuck.

52:48.240 --> 52:51.573
[Ryan] It's easy to let that happen,
to lose yourself.

52:54.670 --> 52:56.991
To believe that no one
could ever know you,

52:57.920 --> 52:58.739
or love you.

53:00.840 --> 53:03.172
-[indistinct police radio chatter]
-[sirens wailing]

53:08.970 --> 53:12.053
[Ryan] And that you're the only person
that knows what you're going through.

53:19.020 --> 53:21.352
And you convince yourself
it's going to get better.

53:24.030 --> 53:25.019
And then, it doesn't.
