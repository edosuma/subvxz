.

00:02.780 --> 00:04.057
There's no need for you
to play peacemaker.

00:04.058 --> 00:05.335
(alvin)
your mother and i
got it all worked out.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.555
- Hey, sergeant?
- Mm.

00:06.556 --> 00:07.772
Just want to thank you
for this opportunity.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.475
- I'm gonna do a great job.
- Fine.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.377
Do you want to keep
answering phones?

00:11.379 --> 00:13.545
I want to be a chicago
police officer.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.147
Let's do it then.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.220
So, lexi, you have
a college picked out yet?

00:21.222 --> 00:22.488
Actually, i was thinking
about riding around

00:22.490 --> 00:24.390
With my boyfriend's band
for a while.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.458
They're doing this tour
from chicago to portland.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.060
- What does he play?
- Whoa.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.361
This is the first
i'm hearing about this.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.896
No, it's not.

00:30.897 --> 00:32.430
I told you about it,
like, two weeks ago, remember?

00:34.535 --> 00:36.368
Erin, how old were you

00:36.370 --> 00:38.570
When you first decided
to be the police?

00:38.572 --> 00:41.206
It was right after hank
took me in.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.241
I was 15.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.609
You go to college
to be a cop?

00:43.611 --> 00:45.477
No, i barely made it
through high school.

00:45.479 --> 00:46.678
- [laughs]
- look, i spent

00:46.680 --> 00:48.514
Four years on the west side
in a patrol car.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.349
That was my education.

00:50.351 --> 00:53.552
So life experience is
just as important as school.

00:56.057 --> 00:57.356
No.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.590
No, i mean,
if i had to do it again,

00:58.592 --> 01:00.192
I would definitely
get a degree,

01:00.194 --> 01:01.527
But, i--
[phone buzzing]

01:01.529 --> 01:03.328
Look, i got to get
to class.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.462
But it was good
seeing you, erin.

01:04.465 --> 01:07.533
Yeah, you too, kid.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.402
- Bye, dad.
- See you, baby.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.603
- See you.
- All right.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.638
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.206
Bye.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.708
Alvin,
i hate to break it to you,

01:16.710 --> 01:19.178
But i don't think lexi's
interested in being a cop.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.747
She wants to be a roadie
with her boyfriend's band.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.682
Yeah, she's a kid.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.351
I got to go
check this guy out.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.187
- No. Alvin, no.
- Oh.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.355
Don't.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.241
Don't do it.

01:32.242 --> 01:34.126
(male dispatcher over radio)
be advised, any tac units

01:34.128 --> 01:36.495

It's two blocks away.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.734
All right, what the hell.

01:44.872 --> 01:48.140
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:50.444 --> 01:52.177
You the one
that called for a breach?

01:52.179 --> 01:54.880
Yeah. Comed guy was replacing
a meter around back.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.149

02:13.667 --> 02:16.635

Al, are you okay?

05:15.582 --> 05:17.616
I'm fine, i'm fine.
They find the car yet?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.484
No, they issued
a city-wide manhunt.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.686
All right,
i'm gonna get some tape.

05:20.688 --> 05:21.787
We can block off
the street.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.922

help me! My little girl!

05:23.924 --> 05:26.458
She's been shot!

05:27.995 --> 05:30.395
[sobs]
oh, god.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.431
We were shopping,
and she was hit.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.700
A stray bullet
from the shooter.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.935
She lost a lot of blood.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.571
- [sobs]
- her pulse is down to below 20.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.906
This is unit 2113.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.607
We're at the 2100 block
of cermak.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.609
Please roll another ambulance
to the scene.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.211
(female dispatch over radio)
unit 2113,

05:46.212 --> 05:47.812
The closest available ambo
is ten minutes out.

05:47.815 --> 05:48.947
I'm taking her
in the squad.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.232
Wait, wait, wait.
You can't transport

05:50.233 --> 05:51.516
An injured victim
in a patrol car.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.851
- Please! Please.
(deluca) hey, you take that kid,

05:52.853 --> 05:54.119
And we could all be
looking at a lawsuit.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.821
- Outta my way, deluca.
- Put that kid down.

05:55.823 --> 05:56.822
If that girl dies,
we could all lose our badges.

05:56.824 --> 05:57.823
Let's go.

05:57.825 --> 05:58.890
- Follow me.
- I said no.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.058
[grunts]

06:00.060 --> 06:04.563
You want to help him up,
or end up down there with him?

06:13.674 --> 06:17.109
An autopsy isn't gonna solve
any big mysteries here.

06:17.111 --> 06:19.678
These girls died from
a combination of starvation

06:19.680 --> 06:21.680
And dehydration.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.683
Check this out.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.419
Bruises to her face.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.967
They fought each other
over the water.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.810
Figure the shooter was here
to bring the girls food.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.012
- Hmm.
- But he got here too late.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.047
The me says the girls have been
dead for at least two days.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.682
Anything on
the shooter's vehicle?

06:57.684 --> 06:59.117
No, i only got
a partial plate.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.686
Waiting to hear back.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.555
The landlord says
he's been getting paid,

07:03.557 --> 07:06.892
Cashier's check, by a guy,
a year in advance.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.163
Well, the shooter ain't our guy,
i can tell you that much.

07:11.165 --> 07:15.066
No businessman is gonna leave
his investment for dead.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.112
- Please!
- Whoa. Hey.

07:16.113 --> 07:17.157
- My daughter--
- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:17.158 --> 07:18.202
- No, no, hey.
- You don't understand.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.204
Get back there. Hey.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.672
- Get back there.
- Please.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.507
- Get back behind the line, pal.
- Please.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.109
(garcia)
look at me.
Get back behind the line.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.710
This is police stuff.
You got to get back, all right?

07:25.712 --> 07:27.129
Hey, what's the problem?

07:27.130 --> 07:28.547
He says his daughter
might be inside.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.915
I need to make sure.
Please.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.082
Sir, this is
a crime scene.

07:31.084 --> 07:34.085
No, it's okay.
We got it. We got it.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.054
Come on in.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.124
[police radio chatter]

07:45.466 --> 07:46.465
[gasps]

07:46.467 --> 07:49.534
My daughter.

07:49.536 --> 07:53.538
[crying]

07:53.540 --> 07:56.708
That's her.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.211
It's jun.

07:59.213 --> 08:01.179
[sobbing]

08:01.181 --> 08:06.751
Mister chen,
we're so sorry for your loss.

08:06.753 --> 08:11.823
Please, we're trying
to help you.

08:11.825 --> 08:16.495
Just tell us who you paid
to bring jun over here.

08:16.497 --> 08:17.796
And you're not gonna get
into any trouble.

08:17.798 --> 08:18.964
No.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.099
You know?

08:20.100 --> 08:21.233
We just want to know
what happened.

08:21.235 --> 08:23.835
Yeah.

08:23.837 --> 08:28.507
I paid them 30,000
to bring jun over.

08:28.509 --> 08:34.044
I got a call last week
that she was in the city.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.982
They wouldn't tell me where,

08:36.984 --> 08:40.952
And they demanded
another 30,000.

08:40.953 --> 08:44.089
And i didn't have it.

08:44.091 --> 08:47.959
Please,
just give us a name.

08:51.231 --> 08:54.666
Dennis lee.

08:56.837 --> 09:00.205
<i>The</i> dennis lee,
who used to run chinatown?

09:09.983 --> 09:11.049
Hey.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.854
Hey.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.155
You know,
i heard that--

09:17.157 --> 09:20.625
That chinatown was a war zone
this morning.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.727
Listen, i've been involved
in more than a few skirmishes

09:22.729 --> 09:26.698
Myself, and with the bullets
flying, there's--

09:26.700 --> 09:29.234
There's got to be a million
things going through your head.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.304
Yeah.
Wasn't pretty.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.274
Yeah.

09:37.644 --> 09:40.111
Hey.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.047
Can i have you look
into somebody for me?

09:42.049 --> 09:43.248
Consider it extra credit?

09:43.250 --> 09:46.117
Yeah, sure.
Who's the--who's the target?

09:46.119 --> 09:48.053
Olinsky's daughter's
boyfriend.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.855
[chuckles]

09:50.857 --> 09:52.891
All right.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.660
I'll send you the details.

10:16.350 --> 10:17.849
Dennis lee.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.719
He's been on cpd's
most-wanted fugitive list

10:20.721 --> 10:22.187
For over six years.

10:22.189 --> 10:25.123
He's wanted on more than 50
combined warrants,

10:25.125 --> 10:28.226
Including firearms
and human trafficking.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.095
I ran across lee
back in vice.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.863
He made his fortune
supplying the south side

10:31.865 --> 10:35.100
With the three g's: Girls,
guns, and gambling machines.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.868
All three he brought over
from china

10:36.870 --> 10:38.837
In shipping containers.

10:38.838 --> 10:40.805
So he thinks six years is long
enough for the heat to die down,

10:40.807 --> 10:42.173
And now he's back
in business.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.275
I got a hit on the burgundy
toyota supra.

10:44.277 --> 10:49.080
It's registered to this guy,
eddie cao, dennis lee's nephew.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.116
That's him.
That's the shooter.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.984
Well, when he's not
running errands for his uncle,

10:52.986 --> 10:54.719
He's a known counterfeiter,
does everything

10:54.721 --> 10:56.755
From knock-off dvds
to gucci bags.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.189
Runs a sweatshop
down on wentworth.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.325
Gear up.

11:04.665 --> 11:08.033
All right, halstead,
ruzek, atwater,

11:08.035 --> 11:11.302
You cover the exits.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.873
Everybody stay sharp.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.276
This guy won't think twice
about lighting up cops.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.747
You ready?

11:22.749 --> 11:23.448
Hit it.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.789

11:43.837 --> 11:46.471
Police!
Wake up!

11:48.842 --> 11:50.909
(voight)
eddie cao.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.111
Let me show you what happens
when you shoot at the police.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.246
What?
[grunts]

11:55.248 --> 11:57.382
Oh!

12:04.958 --> 12:06.091

12:10.130 --> 12:14.866
So...
Where's your uncle?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.901
I don't know.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.336
- [groans]
(olinsky) where is he?

12:23.477 --> 12:25.510
Where's dennis lee?

12:30.817 --> 12:32.751
[panting]

12:32.753 --> 12:34.519
Where's dennis lee?

12:34.521 --> 12:36.287
[groans]

12:38.125 --> 12:41.960
You got about two seconds before
he turns your hand into a glove.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.862
[sewing machine cranking]

12:43.864 --> 12:46.064
[groans]

12:49.169 --> 12:51.269
Okay!
He gave me ten gs

12:51.271 --> 12:53.872
To make the fake passports
and watch those girls!

12:53.874 --> 12:54.873
[whimpers]

12:54.875 --> 12:57.542
And you left them
in there...

12:57.544 --> 13:00.545
Like dogs
on chains to die.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.914
- [whimpers]
- huh? While you got high.

13:02.916 --> 13:03.982
While you got high.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.984
I don't know
where he crashes!

13:05.986 --> 13:09.020
But my uncle's moving
a major load today.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.288
Ah!

13:10.290 --> 13:13.158
- [groans]
- hey, look at me.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.860
He's bringing in more girls?

13:15.862 --> 13:18.163
No, man.
Not girls.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.831
Guns.

13:19.833 --> 13:23.535
[whimpers]

13:24.805 --> 13:25.837
(cao)
[groans]

13:25.839 --> 13:27.005
All right.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.006
(cao)
[whimpers]

13:28.008 --> 13:30.074
Al.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.044
Al.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.180
[whimpers]

13:35.182 --> 13:37.015
Oh!
[panting]

13:37.017 --> 13:39.217
- Get those.
- Got it.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.285
Oh!

13:43.290 --> 13:49.127
So, we got a real "good news,
bad news" situation here.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.161
Give us the bad news
first.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.096
The good news is
the gunshot victim

13:52.098 --> 13:53.865
You brought over
to chicago med?

13:53.867 --> 13:56.167
She's gonna live. They're gonna
keep her over for observation,

13:56.169 --> 13:58.236
But they're hopeful
she'll make a full recovery.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.504
So we made the right call.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.940
Which brings us
to the bad news.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.508
Officer deluca?

14:03.510 --> 14:06.544
He's at chicago med too,
getting an mri.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.146
Are you kidding me?
I just shoved the guy.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.447
More bad news.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.149
He filed a formal complaint.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.134
What?

14:13.135 --> 14:15.118
You're gonna have to debrief
commander fischer.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.621
And i would come up
with something better

14:16.623 --> 14:18.990
Than "i shoved him."

14:20.393 --> 14:22.193
An mri?
You believe that guy?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.561
Sean, we did
what we had to do.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.096
Fischer will
understand that.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.564
I don't know.

14:26.565 --> 14:28.031
The more stripes they have
on their sleeve,

14:28.034 --> 14:30.101
The less they seem
to understand.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.571
Yeah.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.490
That was interpol.

14:35.491 --> 14:37.408
They said lee practically
started a war in shanghai.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.110
He stole money
from his business partners

14:39.112 --> 14:41.145
And burned every contact
that was protecting him.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.513
Eddie cao said
his uncle's unloading

14:42.515 --> 14:45.516
4,000 sks assault rifles
at $500 apiece.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.085
That's 2 mil.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.120
No wonder lee's back.
That's a huge payday.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.421
Lee comes back to chicago,
bringing with him

14:50.423 --> 14:52.290
Shipping containers
full of girls and guns,

14:52.292 --> 14:55.026
Sells them all at once,
then hauls ass out of town.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.362
Mouse and i were able
to id another of the girls

14:57.364 --> 14:59.097
From the warehouse luggage.

14:59.099 --> 15:02.367
Her name is mai ling.
She was 14.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.674
We're trying
to track down family

15:09.676 --> 15:11.559
For the rest of the girls,

15:11.560 --> 15:13.443
And i've reached out to ice
to help with ids.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.545
All right,
you know the parents

15:14.547 --> 15:16.014
Are probably scared to talk.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.049
Just stay on them.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.418
Now, his nephew said
lee's gonna sell these rifles

15:20.420 --> 15:22.253
In two hours
at the container yards.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.188
That's the only way
we're gonna get him.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.924
So what are we waiting for?

15:25.926 --> 15:29.093
All right, go with al.
Set up surveillance.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.134
(ruzek)
how many years
al got on the job?

15:36.136 --> 15:38.603
25, 26?

15:38.605 --> 15:42.140
He could've retired by now,
moved to florida.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.709
Olinsky had full pension
five years ago.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.445
I don't think getting fat and
tan in orlando is his thing.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.613
[chuckles]

15:52.552 --> 15:55.219
Any movement?

15:55.221 --> 15:56.587
Negative, al.
Nothing yet.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.324
After his nephew put on
that little fireworks display

15:59.326 --> 16:02.193
This morning, maybe lee
decided to ditch the meet.

16:02.195 --> 16:06.597
No, this guy doesn't
walk away from money.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.542
You guys got eyes on this?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.480
Yeah.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.349
Six asian males.
Looks like our buyers.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.218
I'm gonna run the plates,
see if i can, uh, get an id.

16:27.220 --> 16:31.356
Don't bother.
I know that guy.

16:31.358 --> 16:34.759
It's jesse kong,
leader of the 14k triads.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.327
Let's take 'em.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.313
- Chicago police!
- Put your hands in the sky!

16:55.315 --> 16:57.315
(antonio)
put 'em up!

16:57.317 --> 16:59.083
Walk back to the red car!

16:59.085 --> 17:00.284
(antonio) keep it going!
(man) hands up!

17:00.286 --> 17:02.120
Get your hands up!
Move over to the car!

17:02.122 --> 17:04.521
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Get over to the car.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.491
(halstead)
drop the bag.
Get on the ground.

17:06.492 --> 17:07.492
Knees on the ground.
Hands above your head.

17:07.493 --> 17:08.492
Up on the red car.

17:08.494 --> 17:09.727
Put your hands on the trunk.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.295
Where's lee?

17:11.297 --> 17:12.730
Hey, hey.
Where's lee?

17:12.732 --> 17:14.332
I don't know.
I-i don't know!

17:14.334 --> 17:16.467
Some--some--some chinese dude,
paid me a grand

17:16.469 --> 17:18.736
To show up here with a key.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.338
Give me the keys.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.740
Give me the keys!

17:22.742 --> 17:23.741
Which one is it?

17:23.742 --> 17:25.742
I-it's the red one
over there.

17:25.744 --> 17:28.079
Over by the red car,
put your hands on the trunk.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.417
[opening shipping container]

17:48.134 --> 17:50.802
So lee gave you
that container number?

17:50.804 --> 17:52.703
Called me.
Said to meet him there.

17:52.705 --> 17:56.307
Had heat on him 'cause
of that junkie nephew of his.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.409
Wanted to unload some guns
quick-like.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.512
(antonio)
we only counted 50k here, jesse.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.315
You think lee was really
gonna sell you 4,000 skss

18:04.317 --> 18:06.117
At that kind of discount?

18:06.119 --> 18:09.787
All i know is lee set you up,
and set me up.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.626
Guess we both got played.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.727
[grunts]

18:19.099 --> 18:22.667
I'll take my phone call now.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.803
Lee never meant to sell
to the triads.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.605
After his nephew
made headlines this morning,

18:27.607 --> 18:29.373
He picked up the real container
earlier.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.808
The one we got
was just a decoy

18:30.810 --> 18:32.777
To keep us busy while he's
out selling to the real buyers.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.412
We find them,
we find lee.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.813
Okay, what about kong?

18:35.815 --> 18:37.482
He's asking
for his phone call.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.516
[door closing]

18:38.518 --> 18:40.384
Sergeant,
we're all set.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.353
I wired-up
jesse kong's vehicle.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.689
I got two pin-hole cameras,
a mic, and gps.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.174
All right, beautiful.

18:46.175 --> 18:47.658
We're gonna kick jesse kong
and the rest of his crew.

18:47.660 --> 18:48.759
Whoa, whoa, wait a second,
wait a second.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.228
We've got the triads
on conspiracy

18:50.230 --> 18:51.696
To purchase weapons.
Come on.

18:51.698 --> 18:55.766
Al, they just got burned
by dennis lee.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.536
We're about to use that
to our advantage.

19:05.378 --> 19:08.179
Wanna make a call?

19:08.181 --> 19:11.616
How about i make you
a one-time-only deal?

19:11.618 --> 19:14.886
That is, if you're interested
in finding dennis lee.

19:14.888 --> 19:17.155
I'm interested.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.224
You find him before we do,
i want to know.

19:20.226 --> 19:22.426
I'll drop all charges.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.364
I get a badge too?

19:26.366 --> 19:29.634
What you get is 12 hours.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.637
If you screw me,
i'll make sure

19:32.639 --> 19:35.706
The gang unit puts you to bed
for the next year.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.680
I guess my question is,
what street crew

19:42.682 --> 19:46.317
Has the bankroll to buy
$2 million-worth of hardware?

19:46.319 --> 19:48.252
[sighs]
let's start running gang files.

19:48.254 --> 19:49.687
I can reach out
to a few cis.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.756
Al.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.492
There's some people downstairs
who want to talk to you.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.660
No, take a message.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.895
Nah, i think you want
to go down, man.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.205
(donald)
detective olinsky.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.272
Yes?

20:09.209 --> 20:10.775
They wanted
to come forward.

20:10.777 --> 20:14.845
Their girls,
they were with jun.

20:22.655 --> 20:26.324
I'm sorry...
For your loss.

20:27.860 --> 20:31.362
I know you're doing
everything you can.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.264
And we wanted to make sure

20:33.266 --> 20:35.533
You had these.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.854
They belonged
to our daughters.

20:59.359 --> 21:02.460
(donald)
they are tokens of luck.

21:04.397 --> 21:08.466
To help you find the man
who took them from us.

21:21.914 --> 21:25.516
Hey.
Are you working something?

21:25.518 --> 21:28.686
Um, no.

21:28.688 --> 21:32.990
No, i-i like to watch
the lights come and go.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.493
Find it kind of relaxing.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.927
Interesting.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.029
Did you run the kid?

21:38.031 --> 21:41.999
Yeah.
Uh, it's, uh, jason monahan.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.502
Now, he has no arrest record.
His mom is a physical therapist,

21:44.504 --> 21:46.871
Dad teaches music composition
at the art institute.

21:46.873 --> 21:49.540
Jason posted some of
his music on--on vine.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.309
He can beat the hell
out of a bass.

21:51.311 --> 21:52.610
What kind of music?

21:54.580 --> 21:55.913
Neo-punk.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.481
Yeah, not as good
as the bad brains or anything.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.783
More like old ramones.

21:58.785 --> 21:59.850
Hmm.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.819
I could track him
if you want,

22:01.821 --> 22:03.721
Tag his tour van,
install a camera.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.323
It's all right.
I got it from here. Thank you.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.390
Yeah.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.664
Hey.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.999
Sorry to bother you
this late.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.600
Where is he?

22:16.602 --> 22:19.470
Out back,
tearing apart the garage.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.571
I didn't know
who else to call.

22:20.573 --> 22:24.542
It's all right.
I'll talk to him.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.344
Hey, um,

22:26.346 --> 22:29.814
Things between me and al
have been really good lately.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.716
But that look
i saw in his eye tonight?

22:31.718 --> 22:34.685
I've seen that look
too many times before,

22:34.687 --> 22:39.056
And every time i did,
i lost him for months.

22:39.058 --> 22:41.559
All right.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.930
[knocking at the door]

22:51.771 --> 22:54.839
Kind of late to be
cleaning out the garage.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.944
I only got one glass.

22:59.946 --> 23:02.813
Al, what are you doing?

23:04.083 --> 23:05.950
These are my files
from organized crime.

23:07.520 --> 23:11.122
When the unit was disbanded,
i don't know,

23:11.124 --> 23:14.992
I just couldn't
let anything go.

23:14.994 --> 23:18.662
But meredith just moved
everything around, so i--

23:20.533 --> 23:23.534
What's so important you gotta
find at 2:00 in the morning?

23:23.536 --> 23:25.403
When we were closing in
on lee,

23:25.405 --> 23:27.705
I spent a lot of time
in the wire room.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.640
Listening to his calls,

23:29.642 --> 23:32.176
There was one name
that just kept popping up.

23:32.178 --> 23:35.913
Prostitute.
She was lee's mistress.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.481
He was crazy about her.

23:37.483 --> 23:41.719
So now, if she's still
in chinatown, i know--

23:41.721 --> 23:44.021
I know he'd go and see her.

23:44.023 --> 23:48.559
And i know i wrote it down!

23:48.561 --> 23:50.494
I know i wrote it down!

23:53.199 --> 23:58.769
You know,
those girls' parents...

23:58.771 --> 24:00.905
What am i supposed to
tell them

24:00.907 --> 24:03.941
If i let this guy
slip away again?

24:03.943 --> 24:08.078
Hey, i want to nail him
as bad as you.

24:10.550 --> 24:15.219
Look, i mean, come on,
i don't got to tell you.

24:15.221 --> 24:18.756
Sometimes they get away.

24:20.793 --> 24:25.129
Six years ago, i lied
on the warrants...

24:25.131 --> 24:28.199
To search lee's
shipping containers.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.237
And he was good, and we had
no real hard intel on him,

24:33.239 --> 24:36.507
The guy--nobody would talk
in chinatown.

24:38.544 --> 24:40.711
So, what do you do?
You follow your gut, right?

24:40.713 --> 24:41.946
Busted one open,
had guns in it.

24:41.948 --> 24:46.116
Another one had
poker machines in it.

24:46.118 --> 24:50.821
Then brass finds out
about my...Thin paperwork,

24:50.823 --> 24:52.490
And they get nervous.
They shut me down.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.992
Two days later,
the guy's in the wind.

25:02.502 --> 25:07.538
So...

25:07.540 --> 25:11.775
If i didn't screw up,

25:11.777 --> 25:15.212
And i'd arrested him then,

25:15.214 --> 25:20.217
Those girls
that we found today...

25:20.219 --> 25:23.521
They wouldn't be dead
right now.

25:27.093 --> 25:30.160
They wouldn't be.

25:48.314 --> 25:52.616
Officer roman, patrolman deluca
filed a formal complaint

25:52.618 --> 25:54.251
Against you
for aggravated battery.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.921
I already heard
his side of the story.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.989
So why don't you tell me
what happened out there?

25:58.991 --> 26:01.692
We were attempting to transport
a tender age child

26:01.694 --> 26:03.861
To the hospital
for medical treatment,

26:03.863 --> 26:06.697
And i had to remove deluca
from our path.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.566
You were a witness
to this infraction,

26:08.568 --> 26:09.834
Yet you failed
to report.

26:09.835 --> 26:11.101
Yeah, because there's nothing
to report, commander.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.102
I mean, we did
the right thing--

26:12.104 --> 26:13.170
Burgess.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.806
My partner isn't to blame,
commander.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.341
It was my decision
to move the victim.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.977
As much as i admire that,
patrolman,

26:19.979 --> 26:23.347
You can't hit another cop
under any circumstances.

26:25.251 --> 26:28.652
Until further notice,
you're suspended.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.992
I'll be calling
my fop rep.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.760
That would be wise.

26:36.762 --> 26:37.928
[door closing]

26:37.930 --> 26:40.931
[footsteps walking away]

26:44.103 --> 26:45.736
I got a name and number
i need you to run.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.638
Oh, morning,
detective.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.007
- Hey.
- Yeah, anna tse.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.910
Um, sergeant voight notified me,
i'm already on it.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.913
Now, her number has been
out of service for years,

26:55.915 --> 26:57.982
And there's about a dozen
anna tses in the chicago area,

26:57.984 --> 26:59.383
But based on the fact
she was a prostitute,

26:59.385 --> 27:01.002
I went ahead and checked
to see if any of them

27:01.003 --> 27:02.620
Had been--have been arrested
for solicitation,

27:02.622 --> 27:04.922
And, well,
this has got to be her.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.324
And, check this out.
See, i figured that she'd be--

27:07.326 --> 27:09.627
She'd be managing
a massage parlor now, right?

27:09.629 --> 27:12.129
No, no, she went and got her--
her finance degree.

27:12.131 --> 27:17.668
Yeah, she--she's a loan manager
over at, uh, midwestern trust.

27:19.005 --> 27:20.871
Hmm.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.307
Immigrant working girl
makes good.

27:23.309 --> 27:26.377
It's the american dream.

27:26.379 --> 27:28.112
Give me her address.

27:33.719 --> 27:36.320
Anna tse!
Open up!

27:36.322 --> 27:39.323
(olinsky)
do it.

27:42.194 --> 27:44.895
(anna)
[speaking chinese]

27:45.998 --> 27:46.997
Were you talking to lee?

27:46.999 --> 27:47.998
Do you have a warrant
for this?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.299
Shut up.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.689
Turn around.

28:11.691 --> 28:12.823
[tightening handcuffs]

28:12.825 --> 28:15.125
Anna tse,
you're under arrest

28:15.127 --> 28:18.195
For aiding and abetting
a fugitive.

28:23.769 --> 28:26.270
Come a long way since your days
in the massage parlor, anna.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.238
How nice of you
to remind me.

28:28.240 --> 28:33.444
Yeah, well,
what i don't get...Is why.

28:33.446 --> 28:35.813
Why let him back
into your life?

28:35.815 --> 28:37.047
That's what i don't get.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.415
You could never understand.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.717
Yeah?
Well, right now,

28:39.719 --> 28:41.285
I'm looking to put
six homicides on you,

28:41.287 --> 28:45.122
So--so you try me.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.759
Hey.

28:48.761 --> 28:53.397
The province where i'm from,
complete and total poverty.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.867
I was 17 when dennis
brought me over,

28:56.869 --> 28:59.403
And if he hadn't--

28:59.405 --> 29:01.472
He helped me find
a better life.

29:01.474 --> 29:03.507
What about the victims?
Where's their better life?

29:03.509 --> 29:05.342
Oh, i came here
just the same.

29:05.344 --> 29:09.146
Small container with a hole
punched on top for light.

29:09.148 --> 29:12.883
Some of us die.
Some of us win.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.087
You tell me where he is.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.227
Several calls were made
late last night

29:23.229 --> 29:26.029
From your office phone
at midwestern trust

29:26.031 --> 29:29.333
To a studio owned
by reggie "sticks" daniels,

29:29.335 --> 29:30.934
The head of the vicelords.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.169
Is that who's buying
the guns?

29:32.171 --> 29:33.771
Dennis doesn't tell me
his business.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.839
Oh, the vicelords
are looking to make power moves

29:35.841 --> 29:38.475
On the west side.
They need that hardware.

29:38.477 --> 29:41.078
All right, grab the others.
Let's get vested up.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.919
Hey.

29:48.921 --> 29:51.421
We're gonna find lee,
and he's gonna go away

29:51.423 --> 29:54.858
A long time for what he let
happen to those girls.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.794
You couldn't catch him
before.

29:56.796 --> 29:59.997
What makes you think
you can catch him now?

30:10.810 --> 30:12.476
[clears throat]

30:12.478 --> 30:15.546
I did it,
cpd written exam.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.883
95?
Not bad.

30:19.885 --> 30:22.553
What--what do you mean?
It's basically 100.

30:22.555 --> 30:24.822
That's like saying
the hawks basically

30:24.824 --> 30:28.992
Beat the kings last night,
even though they lost by a goal.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.895
Yeah, well, next step,
psych exam.

30:31.897 --> 30:34.865
New policy, every candidate
has to take a polygraph.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.569
They grill you about your past,
i don't know,

30:38.571 --> 30:40.470
All the stuff i've done.

30:40.472 --> 30:45.108
We'll see.
Bye-bye.

30:53.919 --> 30:56.854
[indistinct conversation]

30:56.856 --> 30:58.155
Hello.

30:58.157 --> 31:00.190
You've got to drop
those charges against sean.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.092
[laughs]

31:02.094 --> 31:04.361
Not only did that prick
cheap-shot me,

31:04.363 --> 31:05.562
He chipped my tooth.
Look.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.365
I'm gonna have to have
cosmetic work done.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.434
That's not covered
under cpd insurance.

31:10.436 --> 31:13.036
You tell roman
to cough up $3,000,

31:13.038 --> 31:15.305
And i'll consider
dropping the charges.

31:15.307 --> 31:18.976
Until then,
my meatball sub's getting cold.

31:27.453 --> 31:30.387
Believe it or not, some
good artists come out of here.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.456
Not that anybody cares.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.298
Take a break, darling.
Now.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.600
Um, excuse me--
wait!

31:46.672 --> 31:48.171
Everybody,
hands in the air, now!

31:48.173 --> 31:49.940
Whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

31:49.942 --> 31:51.275
Chicago police!

31:51.277 --> 31:52.542
Hands away from the hardware!

31:52.544 --> 31:55.279
Everybody on the ground!
Everybody on the ground!

31:55.281 --> 31:58.382
Put 'em up!
Which one of you is reggie? Huh?

32:00.920 --> 32:05.022
I make music, man.
I ain't got no interest in guns.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.924
Some crates get dumped
at my studio, first thing

32:06.926 --> 32:09.459
I'm thinking is, must be
the new sound mixers i ordered.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.194
Ah, some mistake.

32:11.196 --> 32:14.965
Postal service, man.
They always messing up.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.267
See, i don't think
you're so stupid

32:17.269 --> 32:21.071
That you don't realize
today is your lucky day.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.306
We don't want you.

32:22.308 --> 32:24.074
Hey.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.043
We want dennis lee,

32:26.045 --> 32:27.377
'cause while he was
selling you guns,

32:27.379 --> 32:29.713
He let six teenage girls
rot to death.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.248
Look, man, i'm telling you.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.183
Only chinese dude i know
is the one that sell me

32:33.185 --> 32:35.052
Fried rice
down at the golden duck.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.590
- Sergeant.
- What?

32:40.592 --> 32:42.492
I got something
you want to see.

32:46.398 --> 32:49.166
Check it out, that triad vehicle
you had me wire-up?

32:49.168 --> 32:51.234
Yeah.

32:55.174 --> 32:56.640
We got a hit on lee.
He's crashing

32:56.642 --> 32:59.309
At the royal hotel on michigan.
Spread the word.

33:01.213 --> 33:03.013
- When was this?
- Two minutes ago.

33:03.015 --> 33:04.481
I got the tracker up
on kong's car.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.183
They're heading to
the hotel right now.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.196
[loud gunshots]

33:19.198 --> 33:20.731
Get the long guns!

33:20.733 --> 33:23.400
[people screaming]

33:23.402 --> 33:25.268
(kong)
you lied to me!

33:25.270 --> 33:28.338
Cpd, get down!
Get down!

33:28.340 --> 33:29.740
Get back!
Get down!

33:29.742 --> 33:32.609
(kong)
you attempted to throw me over!

33:32.611 --> 33:33.777
(antonio)
drop your weapons!

33:33.779 --> 33:35.645

33:37.616 --> 33:39.483

- Okay, okay!

33:42.654 --> 33:43.787
[loud gunshot]

33:43.789 --> 33:45.122

33:49.228 --> 33:51.528
Al, go, i got you! Go!

33:54.199 --> 33:55.766
Jesse!

33:55.768 --> 33:57.100

Get on your knees.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.810
Drop it!
Drop it!

34:06.812 --> 34:09.246
Drop it.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.813
Put your gun down.

34:11.784 --> 34:13.817
You forget about
our deal, jesse?

34:13.819 --> 34:16.520
I was gonna bring you
his head.

34:16.522 --> 34:17.621
Dennis lee,
you're under arrest.

34:17.623 --> 34:18.621
Don't!

34:18.623 --> 34:20.290
Come here.

34:23.661 --> 34:26.063
Don't you look at me, man.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.231
- Get on the ground.
- [grunts]

34:43.549 --> 34:44.614
Detective olinsky.

34:44.616 --> 34:45.715
Huh.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.516
Organized crime.

34:47.518 --> 34:51.554
I never forget a face.

34:51.556 --> 34:54.757
You should've
never come back here.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.127
Should've never
come back here.

34:57.129 --> 35:01.264
This ends for you
right now.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.870
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:12.411 --> 35:13.643
(voight)
al.

35:13.645 --> 35:18.448
[breathing heavily]

35:21.153 --> 35:22.252
Al.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.591
Al.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.440
[grunts]

35:43.442 --> 35:45.509
Get him out of here, now.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.379
(ruzek)
on your feet.
Let's go.

35:54.219 --> 35:55.318
Yeah, we're good.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.753
Yeah.

35:56.755 --> 35:59.890
[sirens wailing]

36:07.166 --> 36:08.598
Yeah, you wanted to see us?

36:08.600 --> 36:10.500
Where's anna?

36:10.502 --> 36:13.403
Your true love?
She's in custody.

36:13.405 --> 36:15.539
She's being shipped down
to 26th and cal as we speak.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.844
Well, i guess
that's cleared up.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.412
Let her go.

36:24.249 --> 36:26.783
I sign whatever confession
you want.

36:28.787 --> 36:31.855
Let me tell you something.

36:34.893 --> 36:37.360
I'm not making any trades.

36:38.764 --> 36:42.232
You let six girls die
just 'cause you got greedy.

36:42.234 --> 36:46.770
What happened to those
young women, i am not proud.

36:46.772 --> 36:49.839
But those parents?
[scoffs]

36:49.841 --> 36:52.209
They know the risks.

36:52.211 --> 36:55.912
I think anna knew the risk
when she got in bed with you.

36:57.649 --> 37:00.350
And what's more,

37:00.352 --> 37:04.221
She's gonna do time,
no matter what you sign.

37:04.223 --> 37:06.256
And guess what?

37:06.258 --> 37:08.525
When she gets out,

37:08.527 --> 37:11.528
She's gonna end up
just where she started,

37:11.530 --> 37:13.463
Hustling johns
for rent money.

37:15.500 --> 37:19.436
And you?

37:19.438 --> 37:24.341
You're gonna die in a cell
the size of this room.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.348
I guess that's it then.

38:02.547 --> 38:04.648
Crossing somebody
off the most-wanted list

38:04.650 --> 38:07.717
After six years,
that's gotta feel good.

38:09.888 --> 38:14.357
Yeah.

38:14.359 --> 38:17.294
So mouse and i looked
into lexi's boyfriend.

38:17.296 --> 38:20.397
He's spotless.

38:20.399 --> 38:23.667
She's lucky to have you
looking out for her.

38:23.669 --> 38:26.736
[sighs]
thanks.

38:31.076 --> 38:35.578
Al, don't go crawling
under a rock after this, okay?

38:35.580 --> 38:37.414
You got to focus on
all the ones you saved

38:37.416 --> 38:39.349
Getting lee off the street.

39:04.676 --> 39:05.775
She passed?

39:05.777 --> 39:07.677
Couldn't make heads or tails
of this one.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.079
You gonna have to
re-test her?

39:09.081 --> 39:10.680
Do you know how many
new applicants

39:10.682 --> 39:13.516
I got to do this week?

39:13.518 --> 39:16.753
Seems like a nice girl.
Sure she'll make fine police.

39:16.755 --> 39:19.456
Or not.
That's not my department.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.995
[winces]

39:29.935 --> 39:31.968
Okay, that frickin' hurt.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.604
What are you complaining about?
You passed.

39:34.606 --> 39:35.939
I did?

39:35.941 --> 39:37.407
I told you it would work.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.809
If you can't beat the machine,
you wear it down.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.678
- Thank you.
- Okay, on to phase three,

39:41.680 --> 39:42.979
The physical exam.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.014
I'm gonna pull out
some of my old workout plans.

39:45.016 --> 39:47.050
You wouldn't believe
what i used to be able to squat.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.918
Oh, sounds good.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.091
You wanted to see me,
sergeant voight?

39:55.093 --> 39:59.529
Yeah, come on in.
Close the door.

39:59.531 --> 40:02.599
Have a seat.

40:07.639 --> 40:12.442
The dentist from my social club
does excellent work.

40:13.712 --> 40:14.911
Bill's taken care of.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.846
[chuckles]
all due respect, sir,

40:16.848 --> 40:20.750
I already worked all this out
with officer roman.

40:27.826 --> 40:30.860
You think you're gonna
shake down a cop in my district?

40:30.862 --> 40:32.595
Well, it's not a shakedown.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.898
Take the card.
See the guy.

40:35.834 --> 40:38.868
Or don't.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.770
But then you're gonna need
a hell of a lot more

40:40.772 --> 40:43.206
Than a dentist.

40:54.186 --> 40:56.486
You can leave it open.

41:01.827 --> 41:06.162
How was work?

41:06.164 --> 41:08.131
Oh, same, you know.

41:11.236 --> 41:12.936
I have a trig exam tomorrow.
Can i go study?

41:12.938 --> 41:14.604

41:14.606 --> 41:16.706
