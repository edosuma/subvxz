04:55.261 --> 04:56.000
but that was just an alias.

04:56.000 --> 04:56.963
but that was just an alias.

04:56.995 --> 04:58.000
This is my dad.

And the reason
he didn't show up

05:04.903 --> 05:06.000
No, enough!

05:06.000 --> 05:07.040
No, enough!

05:07.072 --> 05:08.000
The proof is right here.

05:08.000 --> 05:08.408
The proof is right here.

05:08.440 --> 05:09.975
Do not touch that thing.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.211
But, Mom, it--

05:11.245 --> 05:12.000
Will you just go to your room,
[voice breaking] right now!

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Will you just go to your room,

05:23.891 --> 05:24.000
If this lunacy of you being
an assistant superhero--

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
If this lunacy of you being

Sidekick.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.297
I was a sidekick.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.000
If this is remotely true...

05:32.000 --> 05:33.632
If this is remotely true...

05:33.666 --> 05:34.000
then our whole marriage
is a lie.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.968
then our whole marriage
is a lie.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.000
That's not true, Barb.
Everything we are together

Tell me one thing, Pat.

05:56.000 --> 05:56.355
Tell me one thing, Pat.

Today?

19:50.000 --> 19:50.391
Today?

19:50.391 --> 19:52.000
Yeah. She went to the office
to go get her things
and told me to pack up.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.492
Yeah. She went to the office
to go get her things
and told me to pack up.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.000
I gotta get her out of there.

19:54.000 --> 19:54.627
I gotta get her out of there.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.000
I told her not to go, but...

19:56.000 --> 19:56.296
I told her not to go, but...

19:56.328 --> 19:57.998
-What should I do now?
-Just...

19:58.031 --> 20:00.000
-Listen to your mom.
Go home and pack. Okay?
-But--

20:00.000 --> 20:01.334

20:02.536 --> 20:03.536
That's it. It's over.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.000
It's my fault.

20:04.000 --> 20:04.837
It's my fault.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.000
Losing your mother,
that'll hurt forever,
all right?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Losing your mother,
that'll hurt forever,
all right?

20:08.000 --> 20:08.108
Losing your mother,

20:08.142 --> 20:10.000
But I can live with it
as long as I know
you're both safe.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But I can live with it

20:42.675 --> 20:44.000
I know they do, but--

20:44.000 --> 20:44.176
I know they do, but--

20:44.210 --> 20:46.000
But you're not my sister.

20:46.000 --> 20:46.346
But you're not my sister.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.000

21:50.000 --> 21:50.943
Look! I don't know

21:50.978 --> 21:52.000
I could see everything

21:53.980 --> 21:54.000
Your dad's awake?

22:20.006 --> 22:21.140

And my dad.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.143
And my dad.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.945
Henry, your dad knows who I am.

22:25.979 --> 22:26.000
He said he was going
to kill my mom.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.513
He said he was going
to kill my mom.

22:27.513 --> 22:28.000
He can't remember anything
from the last ten years.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
He can't remember anything
from the last ten years.

22:30.000 --> 22:30.450
He can't remember anything
from the last ten years.

22:30.482 --> 22:31.884
What?

22:31.919 --> 22:32.000
He doesn't remember anything
since the day my mother died.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
He doesn't remember anything
since the day my mother died.

22:34.000 --> 22:34.653
He doesn't remember anything
since the day my mother died.

22:34.688 --> 22:36.000
I think it hurts him too much.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.557
I think it hurts him too much.

22:37.590 --> 22:38.000
That's good. I mean... sad.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
That's good. I mean... sad.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.627
That's good. I mean... sad.

But right now, good.

22:45.230 --> 22:46.000
I need to get my staff back.

22:46.000 --> 22:46.566
I need to get my staff back.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.435
And I need to save my dad.

22:49.469 --> 22:50.000
He's different.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.003
He's different.

22:51.038 --> 22:52.000
I think my mom
was starting to change him.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I think my mom
was starting to change him.

22:54.000 --> 22:54.106
I think my mom
was starting to change him.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.840
I saw it.

22:55.875 --> 22:56.000
I felt it.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I felt it.

22:58.000 --> 22:58.310
I felt it.

22:58.344 --> 23:00.000
I bet that's why
Jordan killed her.

23:00.000 --> 23:00.212
I bet that's why
Jordan killed her.

23:00.246 --> 23:02.000
He killed your mom and my dad.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.282
He killed your mom and my dad.

23:03.316 --> 23:04.000

24:18.092 --> 24:20.000
Look, if it helps,
she didn't tell me anything.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.094
Look, if it helps,
she didn't tell me anything.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.000
I read her mind.

24:22.494 --> 24:24.000
Which he's not going
to do anymore.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.330
Which he's not going
to do anymore.

That's only polite.

But if we find the staff
and are able to stop the ISA,

24:38.144 --> 24:39.813
maybe we can all
only save the town,

24:39.846 --> 24:40.000
but we can also save
Pat and my mom.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000

He'll figure out
all of our identities,

25:58.000 --> 25:58.025
The only reason
I'm agreeing to do this

25:58.057 --> 25:59.625
is because I know
you'll do it anyway,

25:59.659 --> 26:00.000
