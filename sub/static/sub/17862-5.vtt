WEBVTT

00:00.880 --> 00:03.681
You've made me believe in you.
Really?

00:03.707 --> 00:04.866
You're engaged.

00:04.867 --> 00:07.866
Do you think I'm gonna let
some wop farm boy have her?

00:07.867 --> 00:09.786
I thought I'd have to work
to get you.

00:09.787 --> 00:12.946
I did love you.
And I loved you.

00:12.947 --> 00:14.746
I don't care what it costs.

00:14.747 --> 00:18.027
Find something that will
rid us of her forever.

00:18.027 --> 00:20.106
I used my body.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.386
They used it.

00:22.387 --> 00:25.067
How can I marry without telling him?

00:25.067 --> 00:29.346
See, he's a man.
Don't risk destroying this.

00:29.347 --> 00:30.866
What could be found?

00:30.867 --> 00:33.946
The full story of what happened
to me at Ravensbruck.

00:33.947 --> 00:37.307
To hear it from anyone else
would be the end of us.

01:20.235 --> 01:23.995
I got through it by going
somewhere in my mind.

01:25.535 --> 01:28.014
Somewhere far away.

01:28.015 --> 01:31.775
I feel as if it happened
to someone else.

01:38.256 --> 01:40.535
But it happened to me.

01:40.536 --> 01:42.616
I feel so...

01:46.056 --> 01:48.856
I should have told you before.

01:50.536 --> 01:53.575
It has to affect how you see me.
I won't let it.

01:53.576 --> 01:55.136
I won't.

01:57.776 --> 02:01.336
I'm so sorry.
I've come to terms with it...

02:03.056 --> 02:05.056
...within myself.

02:18.256 --> 02:21.335
Well, it seems rather
poor timing, I must say.

02:21.336 --> 02:24.735
It's for one night, and
he'll check on James before he goes.

02:24.736 --> 02:27.295
And the reason for this gathering?

02:27.296 --> 02:30.935
It's my annual pre-Christmas bash
for glorious misfits.

02:30.936 --> 02:34.335
The reason for Jack to go?
It may help him understand James.

02:34.336 --> 02:37.455
He'll certainly see that his kind
come in all shapes and sizes.

02:37.456 --> 02:39.575
Well, I think
it's a marvellous idea.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.375
Sarah agrees, don't you?

02:41.376 --> 02:44.535
I don't see it can hurt.

02:44.536 --> 02:47.831
Avoiding facts does more harm
than facing them ever does.

02:51.616 --> 02:54.615
George.
Sorry?

02:54.616 --> 02:59.016
I'm interested in your opinion.
I'd rather not discuss it.

02:59.016 --> 03:02.336
Fear not, Mother,
I'll send Jack home unsullied.

03:02.337 --> 03:04.975
Have you known men like James,
Miss Adams?

03:04.976 --> 03:06.495
I have.
Oh.

03:06.496 --> 03:09.215
So you've mixed in the demimonde?
Not really.

03:09.216 --> 03:10.975
They're found in all sorts of
circles.

03:10.976 --> 03:13.575
I'm aware of that.

03:13.576 --> 03:15.615
Well, perhaps one day
you may enlighten us

03:15.616 --> 03:18.416
about your clearly colourful past.

03:30.056 --> 03:34.895
Do I detect a certain tension
between yourself and Miss Adams?

03:34.896 --> 03:37.936
Stay out of it... please.

03:52.696 --> 03:57.255
James. James, wake up.

03:57.256 --> 04:00.215
It's alright, darling,
it's just a nightmare.

04:00.216 --> 04:03.535
You're home. You're here.

04:03.536 --> 04:05.895
You're safe.

04:05.896 --> 04:09.335
It was dreadful. I was hitting him.

04:09.336 --> 04:14.536
Who?
Again and again with my fists.

04:14.536 --> 04:18.495
I was hitting our son
because he's like me.

04:18.495 --> 04:21.255
It was just a nightmare.

04:21.255 --> 04:26.695
If it's a boy, my grandfather and
me, William on your side of the

04:26.696 --> 04:28.215
If it's hereditary...
You're upsetting yourself.

04:28.216 --> 04:31.615
What would you do if you knew before
he was born? How would you feel?

04:31.616 --> 04:33.496
Stop it!

04:38.616 --> 04:43.616
I would love him
like any other child.

04:44.616 --> 04:46.136
Really?

04:47.896 --> 04:49.975
How could I not?

04:49.976 --> 04:52.856
He comes from our love.

04:54.616 --> 04:56.576
Lie down.

04:58.576 --> 05:00.056
Sleep.

05:37.896 --> 05:40.335
Doris is on a decorations frenzy.

05:40.336 --> 05:43.748
I'm getting out before I end up
draped in tinsel and holly.

05:45.336 --> 05:46.615
Problem?

05:46.616 --> 05:48.495
I'm here to help with yours, I hope.

05:48.496 --> 05:51.055
I'm sure everyone's asking
for time off over Christmas.

05:51.056 --> 05:52.976
I'm juggling it. Just.

05:52.976 --> 05:55.335
I'll take as many extra shifts
as you need.

05:55.336 --> 05:57.455
Won't you be expected at Ash Park?

05:57.456 --> 05:59.695
Well, given my faith,
I'd rather be with my patients.

05:59.696 --> 06:02.136
Surely George wants his...
He understands.

06:03.616 --> 06:06.296
Well, his loss is my gain.
Yes.

06:45.856 --> 06:47.776
I want you to drink all of it.

06:50.136 --> 06:51.656
Well done.

06:59.056 --> 07:00.816
Excuse me.

07:16.976 --> 07:20.576
I love you. That will never change.

07:22.176 --> 07:26.016
I-I don't want to,
but I keep seeing you...

07:28.416 --> 07:30.495
I can't keep these images
out of my mind.

07:30.496 --> 07:32.575
You can't imagine what it was like.
I'm sure.

07:32.576 --> 07:36.815
But I see you... with all those men.

07:36.816 --> 07:39.615
There was no pleasure.

07:39.616 --> 07:42.296
There was only violence and horror.

07:48.016 --> 07:50.376
I feel such anger.

07:52.776 --> 07:55.056
But I will come to terms with it.

07:56.816 --> 08:00.056
But can you marry someone
with that in their past?

08:00.057 --> 08:03.656
I can't let you go.
Don't come back until you're sure.

08:06.896 --> 08:09.096
This is too painful.

08:29.856 --> 08:31.536
So what do you reckon, Mrs Bligh?

08:31.537 --> 08:35.390
Oh, well, you certainly have
the wherewithal for a real schoolro

08:35.414 --> 08:37.494
Thank Mr Bligh from the men.

08:37.495 --> 08:40.614
We're very grateful
you've offered to teach them.

08:40.615 --> 08:45.455
I do hope Mrs Duncan doesn't mind us
taking your spare time.

08:45.455 --> 08:50.255
Ah, there's no Mrs Duncan, ma'am,
just footloose and fancy free me.

08:50.256 --> 08:53.055
Then we don't
have to worry.

08:53.056 --> 08:55.135
Ah, we know that
it's mostly your doing.

08:55.136 --> 08:57.176
So thank you, ma'am.

08:59.415 --> 09:02.775
I'm glad for the chance to be
as busy as my husband is

09:02.776 --> 09:05.815
with the property
and his affairs in the city.

09:08.975 --> 09:10.454
Good day.

09:10.455 --> 09:13.255
Ah, Mrs Bligh, before you go.

09:14.455 --> 09:18.094
Merry Christmas from the men.
Oh.

09:18.095 --> 09:21.295
You said that roses
are your favourite.

09:21.296 --> 09:23.175
I don't think you've got one like
it.

09:23.176 --> 09:26.775
Thank you, John.
I have just the spot for it.

09:26.776 --> 09:29.296
It's Jack, ma'am.

09:30.576 --> 09:32.096
To most.

09:49.775 --> 09:54.094
It's a beautiful rose.
It is. A fine hybrid.

09:54.095 --> 09:57.614
However, I suspect you're not here
for a lesson in horticulture.

09:57.615 --> 09:59.094
No.

09:59.095 --> 10:01.414
I thought you should know
I'm moving into the hospital

10:01.415 --> 10:02.854
over the Christmas period.

10:02.855 --> 10:06.735
I'll be doing double shifts.
Oh. I see.

10:09.695 --> 10:12.095
I know what you're doing.

10:14.295 --> 10:18.094
And I've told George the worst
that can possibly be told.

10:18.095 --> 10:21.272
Nothing Regina unearths can hurt us
if we weather this.

10:23.655 --> 10:25.934
Merry Christmas.

10:25.935 --> 10:28.974
When we settled
on your three months with us,

10:28.975 --> 10:32.534
I foretold that
you would decide its outcome.

10:32.535 --> 10:34.294
I'll only be gone a short while.

10:34.295 --> 10:36.695
Will you?

11:27.575 --> 11:29.654
How may I help you, Mrs Duncan?

11:29.655 --> 11:33.695
I apologise, being
a total stranger and all,

11:33.695 --> 11:36.694
um, but I didn't know
where else to turn.

11:36.695 --> 11:40.694
It-it's about my Jacky.

11:40.695 --> 11:42.454
He's named after his father.

11:42.455 --> 11:45.574
I know things didn't end well here
with Jacky's dad.

11:45.575 --> 11:49.454
It was a long time ago.
It was.

11:49.455 --> 11:53.774
I've gotta tell you, though,
he often spoke of you, and well.

11:53.775 --> 11:56.454
Things have been hard
since he passed.

11:56.455 --> 11:57.654
Ah.

11:57.655 --> 12:01.054
I'm not looking for a handout,
not for myself.

12:01.055 --> 12:03.134
But Jacky's a real clever lad,

12:03.135 --> 12:05.547
and he'll go far
if he can stay at school.

12:07.095 --> 12:09.534
I don't have the money.

12:09.535 --> 12:12.694
John always said that you cared
about that sort of thing, so I...

12:12.695 --> 12:14.255
I understand.

12:16.055 --> 12:18.934
And what would you like
to do with your life, Jack?

12:18.935 --> 12:20.735
A clerk perhaps.

12:23.135 --> 12:25.375
What if you could do anything?

12:27.775 --> 12:30.015
I reckon a doctor, ma'am.

12:32.415 --> 12:36.534
A few more days and James
should be back to rights.

12:36.535 --> 12:38.054
Good.

12:38.055 --> 12:40.174
He's following conversation again,
he's stopped drifting.

12:40.175 --> 12:41.414
Thank you.

12:41.415 --> 12:44.895
I'll give him another once-over
as soon as I'm back from Sydney.

12:44.895 --> 12:48.094
Please don't return spouting
any of Carolyn's nonsense.

12:48.095 --> 12:50.134
If she and Miss Adams had their way

12:50.135 --> 12:53.094
they'd see James
in some bohemian menage.

12:53.095 --> 12:56.414
Well, what if that's what he wants?

12:56.415 --> 12:58.534
He's a married man
expecting a child.

12:58.535 --> 13:00.414
He's chosen to embrace
his family duty.

13:00.415 --> 13:03.134
Fair enough.
Hmm.

13:03.135 --> 13:05.494
No doubt that woman's
been in your ear already.

13:05.495 --> 13:06.974
What, Sarah?

13:06.975 --> 13:10.414
My best efforts have been met
with paranoid ramblings.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.534
Any tensions are of her making.

13:12.535 --> 13:14.414
Have you two had a stoush?

13:14.415 --> 13:16.575
Jack, if we discuss it,
we'll disagree.

13:16.576 --> 13:19.135
I don't like it when we disagree.

13:19.135 --> 13:20.974
You never have.
No.

13:20.975 --> 13:25.095
Come on, I've got your
Christmas present in the car.

13:29.255 --> 13:31.491
Oh.
Don't think you've got one like it.

13:34.895 --> 13:39.054
What?
Oh, your timing is...

13:39.055 --> 13:41.095
Thank you.

13:42.935 --> 13:46.535
It's been a tough year.
It has.

13:49.535 --> 13:53.534
Look at us, eh, still friends.
Oh.

13:53.535 --> 13:55.335
Always.

14:30.895 --> 14:33.134
Merry Christmas, Jack.

14:33.135 --> 14:35.214
Is that...?

14:35.215 --> 14:37.615
Taken from last year's gift, yes.

14:39.055 --> 14:41.814
Thank you for all the work
you've been doing with the men.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.774
They've made wonderful progress.

14:43.775 --> 14:47.174
We've done well, haven't we?

14:47.175 --> 14:48.895
Yes.

14:56.415 --> 14:58.135
You don't have to do that.

14:58.135 --> 15:00.815
Well, you can't leave
everything strewn about.

15:02.215 --> 15:05.054
Oh, Jack.
It's OK.

15:05.055 --> 15:08.894
You know how I feel about you,
you must.

15:08.895 --> 15:12.094
I...
You feel the same way.

15:12.095 --> 15:16.055
I know you do. It's wrong but you
do.

15:17.575 --> 15:19.294
I can't give you what you've got

15:19.295 --> 15:22.695
but I could make you happy,
and you're not.

15:24.615 --> 15:26.535
Come with me.

15:27.895 --> 15:30.615
Come away, Elizabeth.

15:33.415 --> 15:35.535
That's Mrs Bligh.

15:37.495 --> 15:40.614
How dare you presume to know
what constitutes my happiness!

15:40.615 --> 15:43.494
You will go to the overseer,
Mr Duncan, and offer your notice,

15:43.495 --> 15:46.494
or I'll go to my husband
and have you flogged off this property

15:46.495 --> 15:50.375
You love me. You know you do.
Go.

15:52.695 --> 15:54.175
Now!

16:22.615 --> 16:24.135
Grandmother?

16:27.415 --> 16:30.895
Is it James?
No.

16:31.975 --> 16:34.334
Me?
No.

16:34.335 --> 16:38.535
I know I've disappointed you.

16:38.535 --> 16:43.534
Whatever our differences
you know I'll always love you.

16:43.535 --> 16:46.615
Well, that is a comfort.

16:50.255 --> 16:52.174
What is he doing here?

16:52.175 --> 16:54.135
I invited him to join us
for Christmas.

16:54.136 --> 16:55.214
How could you?

16:55.215 --> 16:57.804
Anna, you've never given him
a proper chance.

17:02.495 --> 17:05.175
Promising start.

17:15.705 --> 17:18.778
Gino, it's not fair.

17:19.060 --> 17:23.540
Anna, don't cry, please.

17:24.804 --> 17:26.883
I don't want to go to Darwin.

17:26.884 --> 17:32.803
At least you get to see your papa.
I'm not allowed to see mine.

17:32.804 --> 17:38.004
Why did they lock him up?
'Cause he's Italian.

17:39.084 --> 17:40.884
You should go.

17:48.324 --> 17:51.044
I'm going to marry you
when I grow up.

17:51.644 --> 17:53.244
Don't be so soppy.

17:57.524 --> 18:00.244
Andrew Swanson's here.

18:02.364 --> 18:04.523
And he's staying for Christmas.

18:04.524 --> 18:08.564
It now makes sense why she made us
delay the announcement.

18:10.404 --> 18:12.684
There's no need to be jealous,
she's just making mischief.

18:12.684 --> 18:14.284
He should know the truth.

18:14.285 --> 18:16.364
Maybe it's time he did.

18:20.833 --> 18:24.632
Why she'd invite him under
the circumstances is beyond me.

18:24.633 --> 18:27.272
He knows you've been unwell.
He won't be curious.

18:27.273 --> 18:30.232
I meant the circumstances with Anna.
Oh.

18:30.233 --> 18:34.192
Some sort of last-ditch effort.

18:34.193 --> 18:36.913
Sure you're up to this?
It's a good test.

18:42.713 --> 18:46.232
Andrew.
Olivia. Radiant as ever.

18:46.233 --> 18:48.752
We are so pleased
to have you with us.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.472
A great improvement
on dinner for one.

18:50.473 --> 18:52.752
Mother's with an aunt I can't abide.

18:52.753 --> 18:54.832
There's nothing worse
than being alone at Christmas.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.992
Good to see you on your feet, James.
It's good to be on them.

18:57.993 --> 19:01.152
Father speaks well of Dr Stewart.
Certainly dried him out.

19:01.153 --> 19:05.232
Not that I'm implying...
Oh, of course not.

19:05.233 --> 19:07.672
How is Sir Henry?

19:07.673 --> 19:10.072
In London, trying
to outrun the scandal.

19:10.073 --> 19:13.472
And there we shall draw a veil
over unsavoury matters.

19:13.473 --> 19:16.832
Sarah's not joining us?
She's at the hospital.

19:16.833 --> 19:19.673
George's intended.
I met her at the engagement party.

19:19.673 --> 19:23.032
Of course. Well, Christmas means
little to those of her faith.

19:23.033 --> 19:25.912
I hope we're not late.

19:25.913 --> 19:30.272
Welcome back, James.
Uh, Anna says you've been sick.

19:30.273 --> 19:32.192
I'm much improved. Thank you.

19:32.193 --> 19:35.672
You know Gino, Andrew. You've met.
Not in person.

19:35.673 --> 19:37.672
How are you, old boy?

19:37.673 --> 19:41.392
What happened to you at the
engagement party? You disappeared.

19:41.393 --> 19:45.192
Andrew has difficulty focusing
on any one thing for too long.

19:45.193 --> 19:46.192
Anna.

19:46.193 --> 19:47.832
It seems your granddaughter
has me pegged.

19:47.833 --> 19:51.272
There are exceptions, though, when
I find something worth focusing on.

19:51.273 --> 19:55.272
Well, I'm afraid to say that
dinner is about to be served.

19:55.273 --> 19:57.752
Gino has come with
an invitation for us.

19:57.753 --> 19:59.631
This year Father Joe would like to

19:59.632 --> 20:01.552
invite all faiths
to our midnight mass.

20:01.553 --> 20:05.713
Our family would like to invite
your family to share it with us.

20:05.713 --> 20:08.272
I'm going. I think we all should.

20:08.273 --> 20:11.032
Well, thank your parents,
but I think not.

20:11.033 --> 20:13.112
What about you, old boy?

20:13.113 --> 20:15.752
I've always wondered
what sort of blood sacrifices

20:15.753 --> 20:17.472
you papists get up to.

20:17.473 --> 20:20.472
You can't let him go
on his own, Grandmother.

20:20.473 --> 20:22.472
As I said, dinner awaits.

20:22.473 --> 20:25.672
There must be an extra chair
for my fiance,

20:25.673 --> 20:27.832
surely, even without
his generous invitation.

20:27.833 --> 20:31.472
That's one piece of news
I hadn't caught up on.

20:31.473 --> 20:36.712
We're announcing it after Christmas,
but as we're all here en famille...

20:36.713 --> 20:38.552
I see.

20:38.553 --> 20:42.392
Nothing like a long drive
to give a man an appetite.

20:42.393 --> 20:44.873
- Shall we?
- Yes.

20:51.193 --> 20:53.192
I'm just not playing her game
anymore.

20:53.193 --> 20:56.673
Very well.
As long as it's done with respect.

21:00.233 --> 21:02.472
James, when
you're up to socialising again

21:02.473 --> 21:04.672
I must show you both
some hospitality.

21:04.673 --> 21:07.232
Well, it might be some time
before we're back in the city.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.912
When you are.
Well, thank you.

21:09.913 --> 21:14.192
And for being so kind to Livvy
while I was unwell.

21:14.193 --> 21:16.353
She's fine company.

21:17.513 --> 21:20.352
Perhaps you could join us.
We'd love to.

21:20.353 --> 21:23.272
Wouldn't we?
We would.

21:23.273 --> 21:25.632
Perhaps a visit to the cinema.

21:25.633 --> 21:28.832
I'd love to see one of
the new widescreen films.

21:28.833 --> 21:30.312
CinemaScope.

21:30.313 --> 21:33.352
I find it rather like peering
through the slit in a letterbox.

21:33.353 --> 21:35.272
Well, you'd know, Andrew.

21:35.273 --> 21:38.792
I've become rather a fan
of the foreign film lately.

21:38.793 --> 21:41.472
The last one I saw, oddly enough,
was called 'Anna'.

21:41.473 --> 21:43.632
Oh.
Italian.

21:43.633 --> 21:44.752
How intriguing.

21:44.753 --> 21:47.592
The story of a dancer
torn between two men.

21:47.593 --> 21:49.832
Full of murder and cruelty.

21:49.833 --> 21:54.152
Crazy lot, you Italians,
if your films are anything to go by.

21:54.153 --> 21:56.032
Passionate.

21:56.033 --> 21:58.312
The main thing I've learned
from Italian films

21:58.313 --> 22:03.193
is that when an Italian
gives his heart, he gives it truly.

22:04.553 --> 22:06.793
Such a hopeless romantic.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.673
Hopeless.

22:16.433 --> 22:19.712
Was that exhibition
absolutely necessary?

22:19.713 --> 22:21.752
You brought it on yourself.

22:21.753 --> 22:23.392
You don't understand, do you?

22:23.393 --> 22:26.992
He could do your reputation
irreparable damage if he so chose.

22:26.993 --> 22:29.352
In the world of debs
and tea parties maybe.

22:29.353 --> 22:32.832
That's not my world anymore.
It never really was.

22:32.833 --> 22:34.912
The irony of your rebellion.

22:34.913 --> 22:36.992
I wouldn't mind
all this nonsense, Anna,

22:36.993 --> 22:39.392
if you were fighting
for true independence,

22:39.393 --> 22:42.552
but you're simply tying yourself
to that boy's stove

22:42.553 --> 22:45.952
to dutifully deliver new little
Polettis on an annual basis.

22:45.953 --> 22:48.513
Foolish, foolish girl!

22:57.753 --> 23:00.193
If you'd prefer your privacy, sir...

23:03.513 --> 23:06.592
I don't understand.
What?

23:06.593 --> 23:10.592
Why you're still interested in Anna.
She's engaged.

23:10.593 --> 23:12.872
It hasn't been announced.
It will be.

23:12.873 --> 23:16.192
I'll throw in the towel
if you prefer.

23:16.193 --> 23:20.252
It's not up to me. I simply don't
see the possibility of your success.

23:21.073 --> 23:22.753
We shall see, sir.

24:10.653 --> 24:11.473
Yes.

24:15.833 --> 24:19.312
I hope you don't mind.
As a matter of fact, I do.

24:19.313 --> 24:21.432
The time for games is over.

24:21.433 --> 24:25.193
So, Anna Bligh...

24:28.673 --> 24:30.593
...would you do me
the honour of becoming...

24:30.593 --> 24:33.113
Andrew, stop it.
..of becoming my wife?

24:35.113 --> 24:36.392
What?

24:36.393 --> 24:38.792
Get up. Stop being silly.

24:38.793 --> 24:40.992
I thought you'd appreciate
the romantic approach.

24:40.993 --> 24:43.032
I'm engaged.
Come now.

24:43.033 --> 24:44.592
You don't love me.

24:44.593 --> 24:48.553
You interest me, which is more than
I can say of anyone else.

24:48.554 --> 24:50.232
You've run, I've chased.

24:50.233 --> 24:52.752
Now you stop, I catch.
I've been caught.

24:52.753 --> 24:55.432
The joke is wearing thin, Anna.
It's no joke.

24:55.433 --> 24:58.833
You can't be serious.
Yes, I am.

25:02.033 --> 25:05.273
A good soldier never
retires from the field.

25:10.033 --> 25:12.912
Keep it.
I won't change my mind.

25:12.913 --> 25:15.313
You won't marry him.

25:19.913 --> 25:23.673
You won't dine with a monkey
at your table every night.

25:36.244 --> 25:38.483

25:46.604 --> 25:49.282
Your behaviour has become
impossible to ignore.

25:49.283 --> 25:51.122
I didn't ask you
to come after me.

25:51.123 --> 25:53.202
You're not driving like that.
None of your ruddy...

25:53.203 --> 25:55.674
Let's get you to bed.
You're not my mother!

25:56.425 --> 25:58.304
I did not give you everything

25:58.305 --> 26:00.985
to stand back and watch you
turn into this.

26:03.865 --> 26:05.424
You don't know.

26:05.425 --> 26:09.705
Well, how can I help you
if you won't tell me? Tell me!

26:11.745 --> 26:14.544
Bloody Japs. Bloody Japs.

26:14.545 --> 26:17.265
Oh, God, what did they do to you?

26:18.665 --> 26:21.224
Jack, trust me.

26:21.225 --> 26:23.065
Take my hand.

26:26.225 --> 26:27.745
Take it.

26:28.905 --> 26:30.985
Now stand up. Come on.

26:33.945 --> 26:36.544
I refuse to see you in the gutter.

26:36.545 --> 26:41.184
This is going to stop
and it's going to stop here and now!

26:41.185 --> 26:43.305
You be a man.

26:49.105 --> 26:51.905
Just a tick.

27:04.585 --> 27:05.904
Yes.

27:05.905 --> 27:09.553
I just need your signature on these
and then you're free to go.

27:11.985 --> 27:14.344
Do you have everything you need?
Yeah.

27:14.345 --> 27:16.144
Even packed my feather boa.
Hmm.

27:16.145 --> 27:19.825
Then according to Elizabeth,
you'll be right at home.

27:21.025 --> 27:22.544
What?

27:22.545 --> 27:27.145
Oh... maybe I should stay.

27:28.985 --> 27:31.344
James might need me.
James will be fine.

27:31.345 --> 27:34.184
I can't imagine you won't be
enlightened in some way.

27:34.185 --> 27:35.945
And entertained.

27:35.945 --> 27:37.984
Yeah, I guess it does give me

27:37.985 --> 27:39.944
something to talk about
over Christmas pud.

27:39.945 --> 27:42.425
There you go then.
Sarah.

27:44.225 --> 27:46.345
Moving in here?
It's temporary.

27:48.705 --> 27:50.265
I hope so.

28:51.585 --> 28:53.464
Oh.
Not like that.

28:53.465 --> 28:56.504
He likes the dusky ladies.
Right.

28:56.505 --> 29:00.785
They, on the other hand,
do like men, dusky or otherwise.

29:07.425 --> 29:10.704
Carolyn, darling, a triumph.

29:10.705 --> 29:14.064
Brian, this is my dear friend Jack.

29:14.065 --> 29:16.344
Pleased to meet you, Brian.
Oh, no, no, no.

29:16.345 --> 29:18.544
Tonight, darling, it's Mary.

29:18.545 --> 29:22.184
Mary Christmas. Nice?

29:22.185 --> 29:25.145
Excuse me. Oooh!

29:26.745 --> 29:29.104
It's one thing to have
an eye for a bloke,

29:29.105 --> 29:31.929
but why do they have to act
so bloody flamboyant?

29:32.665 --> 29:34.705
Let's broaden your horizons.

29:38.985 --> 29:43.304
George, your unhappy mood is
becoming obvious to our guest.

29:43.305 --> 29:45.024
You invited him.

29:45.025 --> 29:47.544
Miss Adams has confided in me that

29:47.545 --> 29:51.865
you and she are grappling with
certain revelations that she's made.

29:53.745 --> 29:56.024
I'd be a hypocrite
if I didn't express my hope

29:56.025 --> 29:58.824
that it will bring
this misalliance to an end.

29:58.825 --> 30:00.385
It won't!

30:09.545 --> 30:12.064
Jack, Charles.
Charles, Jack.

30:12.065 --> 30:15.344
Jack's a doctor from Inverness,
my dear friend.

30:15.345 --> 30:18.745
Charles is a divorce lawyer.
He does all the best people.

30:18.745 --> 30:20.864
In the nicest possible way.

30:20.865 --> 30:22.465
Ah, Elva darling, meet Jack.

30:22.466 --> 30:24.144
Jack, my wife, Elva.

30:24.145 --> 30:27.864
And you are?
Gorgeous, aren't you, sweetheart?

30:27.865 --> 30:31.265
You're married.
In the nicest possible way.

31:21.865 --> 31:24.584
One win, three losses.
Disappointing performance.

31:24.585 --> 31:26.624
Don't worry,
we'll get them next time.

31:26.625 --> 31:28.104
Doubt it.

31:28.105 --> 31:32.464
You can't blame Solomon for the
loss. The poor bloke was ill.

31:32.465 --> 31:34.784
Taking on the Saffas
with crook guts is madness.

31:34.785 --> 31:36.344
He's too young to be captain.

31:36.345 --> 31:37.864
I bet you weren't saying that

31:37.865 --> 31:40.905
when he scored that try at the death
against Fiji last year.

31:40.905 --> 31:43.584
That test was a nail-biter, alright.

31:43.585 --> 31:45.785
I'll never understand
the fascination

31:45.786 --> 31:47.504
you lads have with football.

31:47.505 --> 31:49.825
Not all football.
Just rugby.

31:52.545 --> 31:54.065
Anyway, that's me done.

31:55.385 --> 31:58.784
Look me up when you're next in town
then. Caro's got my address.

31:58.785 --> 32:01.105
Yeah, will do, Wally.
Good on you, mate.

32:03.185 --> 32:06.784
Don't get your hopes up.
Hmm.

32:06.785 --> 32:08.425
Bye-bye.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.744
What's so funny?

32:15.745 --> 32:17.265
You just made a date.

32:18.905 --> 32:21.144
He's not.
He is.

32:21.145 --> 32:24.144
But he just seemed so... normal.

32:24.145 --> 32:25.625
All shapes and sizes.

32:27.185 --> 32:29.545
Were you tempted?
No.

32:29.545 --> 32:32.905
So no matter what they want you
to be you are who you are.

32:32.906 --> 32:36.664
Of course.
That's exactly the way James feels.

32:36.665 --> 32:38.784
James wants to change.

32:38.785 --> 32:41.224
Only because
he's been told he should.

32:41.225 --> 32:43.904
He should be free to live his life
without shame.

32:43.905 --> 32:46.824
What, like Mary Christmas?
Like all of them.

32:46.825 --> 32:48.824
I don't think Elizabeth
would ever forgive me

32:48.825 --> 32:51.265
if I got James waltzing around
like Carmen Miranda.

32:51.265 --> 32:52.944
But it's his choice to make.

32:52.945 --> 32:55.769
Although maybe not
the bowl of fruit on his head.

32:56.945 --> 32:58.424
You're serious.

32:58.425 --> 33:02.585
Olivia deserves better
than a compromise. Any woman does.

33:07.065 --> 33:08.624
Yeah.

33:08.625 --> 33:10.105
What?

33:11.465 --> 33:13.025
Nothing.

33:15.505 --> 33:17.144
It's late.

33:17.145 --> 33:20.144
We used to stay up
much later than this.

33:20.145 --> 33:21.864
Yeah, well, we're not
that young anymore.

33:21.865 --> 33:24.064
We're not that old either.
Carolyn...

33:24.065 --> 33:28.945
The way I felt back then...
it hasn't changed.

33:30.945 --> 33:33.344
Not a day's gone past...
OK, I should go.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.184
What just happened?

33:35.185 --> 33:37.144
Nothing.

33:37.145 --> 33:39.304
Was it what I said about James?
No, no.

33:39.305 --> 33:42.265
It was something.
Just forget it.

33:43.705 --> 33:46.353
There's a perfectly good bed
right here, Jack.

33:52.785 --> 33:54.705
Merry Christmas.

34:05.145 --> 34:07.744
I can't. I'm sorry.

34:07.745 --> 34:09.744
I'm sorry.
Jack?

34:09.745 --> 34:12.344
Wait!

34:42.628 --> 34:45.360
James, aren't you
supposed to be sleeping?

34:45.387 --> 34:48.547
'Jungle Man' - I should have known.

34:48.572 --> 34:51.212
He could beat
all the rotten old Japs, Mummy.

34:51.213 --> 34:53.973
Daddy will keep us safe.
We don't need him.

35:15.413 --> 35:18.652
You've been very good today,
haven't you, little one?

35:18.653 --> 35:21.573
No kicking to disturb Mummy.

35:23.693 --> 35:26.332
Did you hear what Andrew said?

35:26.333 --> 35:27.972
Hmm?

35:27.973 --> 35:31.773
He said I looked as if
I'd stepped out of a nativity play.

35:34.413 --> 35:35.893
What's that?

35:38.773 --> 35:43.572
I was testing myself,
seeing if it nauseated me.

35:43.573 --> 35:46.333
And did it?
Quite the opposite, actually.

35:48.253 --> 35:50.413
Brought back some happy memories.

35:52.053 --> 35:55.613
My mother used to catch me reading
comic books by torchlight.

35:55.613 --> 35:59.612
My favourite weekly
was 'School Friend'.

35:59.613 --> 36:02.212
I would devour it
as soon as it arrived.

36:02.213 --> 36:03.692
Under the covers?

36:03.693 --> 36:06.772
Only if I hadn't finished
by bedtime.

36:06.773 --> 36:10.772
You see, no-one wore a loin cloth
in 'School Friend'.

36:10.773 --> 36:13.093
I'm sure.

36:34.773 --> 36:37.492
I do feel like Mary in a way.

36:37.493 --> 36:41.293
I'm carrying all the hopes
of our little world inside me.

36:45.493 --> 36:48.773
That sounded very silly.

36:50.573 --> 36:52.253
Not at all.

36:55.093 --> 36:56.693
Goodnight.

37:08.413 --> 37:12.533
Soon it will all be like
it was a bad dream.

37:19.573 --> 37:21.773
That's what Father said.

37:27.213 --> 37:29.293
There's something we need to do.

37:30.853 --> 37:32.333
With Father.

37:33.333 --> 37:34.933
Tomorrow.

37:44.773 --> 37:48.253
Is this really necessary?
Yes.

37:55.733 --> 37:58.332
I don't mean to be cruel

37:58.333 --> 38:01.132
but something needs saying
and I need to say it here.

38:01.133 --> 38:03.572
In Olivia's condition...
I'm fine.

38:03.573 --> 38:07.253
If it helps.
I hope so.

38:08.333 --> 38:15.213
All my life I've been running
and I want it to stop.

38:17.773 --> 38:20.132
This is where I kissed Harry.
James...

38:20.133 --> 38:22.332
I wouldn't be saying this
if it wasn't necessary.

38:22.333 --> 38:26.413
We've put all that behind us.
No, we haven't.

38:26.413 --> 38:28.852
That's the point.

38:28.853 --> 38:33.373
We can't until you both
accept who I am.

38:34.693 --> 38:38.012
No more talk of... of bad dreams.

38:38.013 --> 38:40.652
No more sweeping it under the carpet

38:40.653 --> 38:43.573
to avoid the fact
that I will always be this.

38:45.413 --> 38:47.453
I tried changing.

38:49.573 --> 38:51.293
I can't.

38:53.213 --> 38:55.732
Then how do we proceed?

38:55.733 --> 38:59.932
As husband and wife, I hope.

38:59.933 --> 39:03.292
As parents.

39:03.293 --> 39:06.652
As father and son.

39:06.653 --> 39:09.012
I made marriage vows,
I'll never betray them,

39:09.013 --> 39:12.053
but if I did, you have to accept
it would be with a man.

39:12.054 --> 39:13.052
Oh, son...

39:13.053 --> 39:16.348
The only way I can move forward
is by facing the truth...

39:18.293 --> 39:20.693
...and then moving beyond it.

39:24.693 --> 39:27.253
Then we face it.

39:31.133 --> 39:32.613
Father?

39:34.093 --> 39:36.132
And move beyond it.

39:36.133 --> 39:38.133
Yes.
