WEBVTT

00:45.513 --> 00:47.148
-That's enough.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.585
Bedtime.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.087
Lights out

00:53.121 --> 00:54.722
and night light on.

00:57.658 --> 00:58.692
Night light out.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.161
Lights on?

01:00.194 --> 01:01.695
Lights on!

01:01.729 --> 01:03.564
Lights on! Lights on!
Lights on! Lights on!
Lights on!

01:03.597 --> 01:06.734
I do not like the dark!

01:06.767 --> 01:09.303
I can't see where things are!
I gotta find a light!

01:09.337 --> 01:10.438
Oh!

01:11.539 --> 01:13.707
Oh, my shin! My solar plexus!

01:13.741 --> 01:15.609
ROBIN: Cyborg,
is everything okay?

01:15.643 --> 01:17.611
STARFIRE: We heard the screams
of the little girl.

01:17.645 --> 01:20.581
CYBORG:
Eight-eyed monster!

01:20.614 --> 01:23.217
-CYBORG: Oh, phew.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.885
I scared it off.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.888
Wow, that monster
really did a number
on you guys, huh?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.358
Power went out. I'll check
the grid in the morning.

01:30.391 --> 01:33.494
No, you will
check the grid immediately.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.330
Bro, are you
scared of the dark?

01:36.364 --> 01:38.466
Of course not.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.334
As your friends,
we would understand.

01:40.368 --> 01:43.404
-Oh, I wouldn't.
-Yeah, only babies
are scared of the dark.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.773
I am not scared of the dark.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.909
I am scared of
what hides in it.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.612
-Whoa, spooky.

01:51.645 --> 01:55.483
It all started at
a slumber party
many years ago.

01:55.516 --> 02:00.154
-My friends forced me
to play Scary Teri.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.756
That stupid baby game
that's supposed to summon
a scary ghost?

02:02.790 --> 02:05.759
It is not a game, people!
It is not a game!

02:05.793 --> 02:11.165
Gathering all of my courage,
I turned to the mirror
and said the words...

02:11.199 --> 02:14.502
Scary Teri. Scary Teri.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.737
Scary Teri!

02:32.686 --> 02:34.655
I barely escaped Scary Teri
that night.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.658
That's why I've slept with
the light on ever since.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.794
Wow, that is
an embarrassing story.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.464
Yeah, you know Scary Teri
isn't real, right?

02:43.497 --> 02:46.334
Not real?
The woman almost ate my soul!

02:46.367 --> 02:48.736
Why is this
so hard to believe?
Raven's father is a demon.

02:48.769 --> 02:52.673
Yeah, but he doesn't
waste his time hanging out
at little kids' sleepovers.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.408
Unless he's, you know,
super bored.

02:54.442 --> 02:58.279
Maybe we can help you get over
your stupid, shameful and
completely unjustified fear.

02:58.312 --> 03:02.283
-What if we held
the party of slumber tonight?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.418
ALL: Slumber party!

03:14.462 --> 03:16.297
You wear that to bed?

03:16.330 --> 03:18.632
Just part of my never ending
war on crooked teeth.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.301
I shall never surrender.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.570
So now we just go to sleep?

03:22.603 --> 03:25.506
No way, dude. Sleepovers
aren't about sleeping.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.576
They're about
all the awesome stuff you do
instead of sleeping.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.447
First up, building
the world's best blanket fort

03:33.481 --> 03:36.850
according to these
very detailed blueprints
I made.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.719
We'll start with
laying the foundation.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.522
Then, in two hours,
when that's done, we can...

03:44.292 --> 03:46.360
Oh, come on!
It's not that complicated.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.996
Once the primary
support column is up...

03:49.029 --> 03:51.865
I'll do it myself.

03:51.899 --> 03:55.336
Hey, Cyborg,
know the best part
about slumber parties?

03:55.369 --> 03:56.804
Pillow fight! Yah!

04:02.776 --> 04:05.279
Raven, help! I'm under attack.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.481
-No, thanks.
-Raven, come on!

04:07.515 --> 04:08.616
I'm not playing.

04:08.649 --> 04:09.750
Aw, please, mama?

04:09.783 --> 04:11.552
It won't be fun
if you don't play.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.354
Fight of the pillow!

04:13.387 --> 04:16.524
ALL:
Fight of the pillow!
Fight of the pillow!

04:16.557 --> 04:17.791
Fine.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.369
Ooh, ooh, Titans,

04:28.402 --> 04:31.639
I know an activity to take
Cyborg's mind off of his fear.

04:31.672 --> 04:35.576
The game of Candor
or Audacious Undertaking.

04:36.444 --> 04:37.911
You mean Truth or Dare.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.680
ALL: Oh.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.685
Who knows
what crazy things I might do

04:44.718 --> 04:46.587
-if given the dare.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.657
I dare you to kiss...
No, I dare you to date me
for a few years.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.793
And then move in with me,
and then, one night,
when the moon is full,

04:52.826 --> 04:54.027
to watch me
bend down on one knee...

04:54.061 --> 04:56.964
And to name
our third child Cecilia,
after my favorite aunt.

04:56.997 --> 05:00.668
And then hold my hand
as the sun goes down
over the mountains

05:00.701 --> 05:04.805
and whisper in my ear,
"It has been the good life."

05:04.838 --> 05:07.941
-That is your dare.
-I was going to
pick the truth.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.344
Oh. Would you
do all that stuff?

05:10.378 --> 05:12.546
-No.
I see.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.681
I'll be in the blanket fort.

05:17.785 --> 05:20.721
Why, Robin

05:20.754 --> 05:23.691
You had to
put it all out there.
Stupid! Stupid!

05:23.724 --> 05:25.759
She thinks you're a jerk.
Why doesn't she love me?

05:25.793 --> 05:28.962
My teeth are straight.
They're so straight!

05:28.996 --> 05:30.731
Not to mention my awesome hair

05:30.764 --> 05:34.134
and I've shown loving
father skills to Silkie!

05:34.167 --> 05:35.703
Okey dokey...

05:35.736 --> 05:37.638
Oh, I got a good dare!

06:13.774 --> 06:16.610
Whoo! That was awesome!

06:16.644 --> 06:18.912
That's what
I'm talking about, brah!

06:18.946 --> 06:21.615
Are you feeling better
about the nighttime?

06:21.649 --> 06:23.517
You know what? I think I am.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.754
I'm glad you decided to stop
acting like a big dumb baby.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.389
-Well, good night.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.561
Is everybody okay?
I'm pretty sure
I heard Scary Teri.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.764
Okay, I think there's
only one way to fix this.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.499
Wait, what are you...

06:38.532 --> 06:41.502
No... Come on, you wouldn't!

06:41.535 --> 06:43.637
I don't want to
play Scary Teri!

06:43.671 --> 06:45.806
Just do it, Cyborg!

06:45.839 --> 06:49.109
You guys don't understand,
she'll destroy us all!

06:49.142 --> 06:50.744
Say it first!

06:51.244 --> 06:52.813
All right.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.784
Scary Teri. Scary Teri.
Scary Teri.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.723
See, Cyborg,
isn't that better?

07:07.561 --> 07:10.864
-She's so scary!

07:12.232 --> 07:14.802
Her ragged clothes!

07:14.835 --> 07:17.671
Oh, I just bought these.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.107
Ugh! Her ratty, unkempt hair!

07:20.140 --> 07:23.544
I didn't have time
to wash it this morning.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.713
Her dirty, ugly face.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.081
This is just how I look.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.218
No, you're right.

07:31.251 --> 07:34.087
I should really take
better care of myself.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.893
So, how do we defeat her?

07:39.927 --> 07:41.695
Wow, that's a weird
way of saying

07:41.729 --> 07:43.597
"Oh, Cyborg,
you're totally right.

07:43.631 --> 07:47.801
"Sorry for making you relive
your childhood trauma."

07:48.301 --> 07:50.103
We need a mirror.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.172
I have several full-length
and hand-held mirrors
in my room.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.784
She's blocking Robin's room!

08:03.817 --> 08:07.120
Titans, to the blanket fort!
Go, go, go!

08:07.154 --> 08:09.757
Did you seriously
put a mirror in here?

08:09.790 --> 08:11.024
Among other things.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.896
STARFIRE: Robin, it's amazing!

08:16.930 --> 08:19.600
BEAST BOY: Whoa! Fresh dude!

08:23.771 --> 08:25.806
Is that a basketball court?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.174
No, that's a bowling alley.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.142
The basketball court's
in the basement.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.611
Whoa!

08:30.644 --> 08:32.212
Yeah, yeah, it's impressive,

08:32.245 --> 08:34.615
but there's a demon lady
trying to eat our souls
right now!

08:46.093 --> 08:48.528
There's a mirror
in the downstairs rumpus room.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.066
ALL: Pillow fight!

08:55.603 --> 08:58.538
There's another one in
the dance studio! Go, go, go!

09:00.941 --> 09:02.542
Beast Boy!

09:04.011 --> 09:07.314
ALL: Candor or Audacious
Undertaking!

09:07.347 --> 09:10.584
Oh, I love this game.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.319
I got a fun one.

09:12.352 --> 09:15.188
I dare all of you

09:15.222 --> 09:18.091
-to get in my mouth!

09:18.826 --> 09:20.227
We must get to a mirror.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.730
ROBIN: Ahhh! Whoa!

09:22.763 --> 09:24.197
Cyborg, you have to
get the mirror!

09:24.231 --> 09:26.333
It's in the second
guest bedroom.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.635
You can do this.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.337
Just because you're
scared doesn't mean
you're not strong.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.676
Okay, I can do this!

09:45.919 --> 09:48.756
Time to join your friends,
little boy!

09:48.789 --> 09:51.725
I'm not a little boy anymore.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.027
Scary Teri isn't scary.
Scary Teri isn't scary.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.996
-Scary Teri isn't scary!

09:58.866 --> 10:01.835
Ha, I finally got you,
you not-so-scary witch!

10:01.869 --> 10:03.837
Hey, the lights are back on!

10:03.871 --> 10:06.106
Best slumber party ever!

10:06.139 --> 10:08.008
-Booyah!

10:10.744 --> 10:12.279
Eight-eyed monster!
