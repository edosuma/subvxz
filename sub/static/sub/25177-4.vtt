00:08.210 --> 00:09.731
<i>Previously on </i> Cloak and Dagger...

00:09.778 --> 00:11.539
Billy!

00:11.540 --> 00:13.579
Daddy!

00:13.580 --> 00:15.539
Wait, are you that kid from the beach?

00:18.750 --> 00:19.735
You need a bath.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.219
I mean, isn't there something
else we could do?

00:21.244 --> 00:22.749
<i>I could give you a concussion.</i>

00:22.750 --> 00:24.579
<i>Both open up the mind past the conscious</i>

00:24.604 --> 00:27.039
<i>so you can walk in the Land of the Loa.</i>

00:27.040 --> 00:28.119
Daddy!

00:28.120 --> 00:29.379
Tandy!

00:34.415 --> 00:35.710
I think we need to talk.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.539
You think?

00:38.540 --> 00:40.000
Not really sure where to start.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.169
Well, how about you start with

00:42.170 --> 00:44.039
how the hell you found me here.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.959
Oh, this church, I, um...

00:45.960 --> 00:48.119
I actually saw it
on a Voodoo tour, but...

00:48.120 --> 00:49.540
then I saw it in your head.

00:50.880 --> 00:51.959
In my head?

00:51.960 --> 00:53.120
Maybe it was your heart?

00:54.170 --> 00:55.289
Maybe it was nothing.

00:55.290 --> 00:57.000
Well, it wasn't nothing.

00:58.290 --> 01:00.669
'Cause you're here.

01:00.670 --> 01:03.079
Just like you were
in the middle of the road...

01:03.080 --> 01:05.209
firing a gun.

01:05.209 --> 01:06.920
And in the cemetery that night...

01:09.210 --> 01:10.999
firing God knows what.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.169
What happened to us back there?

01:13.170 --> 01:14.999
Why is it still happening?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.039
You know?

01:16.040 --> 01:17.290
Why us?

01:18.420 --> 01:19.619
I don't know.

01:19.620 --> 01:21.500
But you're right about one thing.

01:22.790 --> 01:24.539
We need to talk.

01:24.540 --> 01:25.999
Hash it all out.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.459
Maybe then we'll find an end
to this whole shitshow.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.039
It all started with a bath.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.249
Bath?

01:42.250 --> 01:44.119
Yeah, it was supposed to be cleansing

01:44.120 --> 01:47.329
with, like, root-work and karma, and...

01:47.330 --> 01:49.459
- all that.
- Fizzy bubble bomb for the soul?

01:49.460 --> 01:51.289
Yeah. Something like that.

01:51.290 --> 01:53.379
You fall for that touristy crap?

01:53.380 --> 01:54.879
No.

01:54.880 --> 01:55.919
No, but the woman said

01:55.920 --> 01:58.289
it would point me towards answers.

01:58.290 --> 02:00.079
And it did in a way.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.500
But I think they were your answers.

02:03.620 --> 02:06.919
I mean, you were right there.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.419
Clear as day.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.619
Your whole life.

02:11.620 --> 02:13.379
First as a little girl,

02:13.380 --> 02:15.829
ballerina, actually.

02:15.830 --> 02:17.539
This might sound insane.

02:17.540 --> 02:19.500
No, not as insane as you think.

02:20.580 --> 02:22.209
So what were they?

02:22.210 --> 02:23.959
My answers?

02:23.960 --> 02:26.120
Does the name ROXXON
mean anything to you?

02:27.120 --> 02:28.919
Yeah, my dad used to work there.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.669
Well, he was there, I think.

02:30.670 --> 02:32.039
Your dad.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.499
The ROXXON guys, they were
putting him through hell.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.329
Killing him, torturing him.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.539
Over and over.

02:37.540 --> 02:39.999
What was I doing?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.539
You kept running.

02:41.540 --> 02:42.880
Yeah, that sounds about right.

02:46.330 --> 02:47.750
But then you didn't.

02:49.710 --> 02:51.579
Last time, you stayed.

02:51.580 --> 02:52.999
And you fought back.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.289
You saved him.

02:54.290 --> 02:55.620
No, that's impossible.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.040
My dad died the night of the storm.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.380
So what does this all mean?

03:09.960 --> 03:11.330
Do you have practice today?

03:14.500 --> 03:16.829
Hey! Hey!

03:16.830 --> 03:18.289
Your mother asked you a question.

03:18.290 --> 03:19.999
- What?
- You okay?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.749
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just late.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.329
No, you're not.

03:23.330 --> 03:24.669
Now, your mother made breakfast.

03:24.670 --> 03:26.830
- Now, sit down and enjoy it with us.
- No!

03:27.960 --> 03:30.000
Okay? I got things to do.

03:48.210 --> 03:50.540
Well, come in if you're coming in.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.709
Should I ask about that lady officer?

03:54.710 --> 03:56.170
Or will that make me an accessory?

03:57.500 --> 03:59.789
She had the wrong girl.

03:59.790 --> 04:00.790
Mm-hmm.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.170
So what brings you here?

04:04.580 --> 04:07.249
I wanna know about the ROXXON thing.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.460
Dad's case.

04:09.670 --> 04:12.879
You mean the case that you're
always ridiculing me about.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.580
Mom, I'm sorry about that.

04:15.790 --> 04:17.879
I know this whole time
you've been focused

04:17.880 --> 04:19.668
on trying to get our old life back.

04:19.670 --> 04:21.079
With the house and the money.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.460
It is not just about money.

04:25.750 --> 04:28.079
I mean, the money would be good.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.499
Really good.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.919
It's about your father's name.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.170
His reputation.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.919
How well do you remember him?

04:34.920 --> 04:36.879
Really remember him?

04:36.880 --> 04:39.330
I remember I felt safe
when I was with him.

04:40.330 --> 04:42.420
That he was kind and smart.

04:43.540 --> 04:45.000
I remember he told bad jokes.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.080
But I don't remember any of 'em.

04:50.380 --> 04:52.880
Well, he was the hardest
working person that I ever met.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.039
If there was a problem...

04:56.040 --> 04:57.379
he'd set out to fix it.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.539
Leaky faucet, global warming.

04:59.540 --> 05:00.789
Didn't matter.

05:00.790 --> 05:02.419
You break it down.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.289
Understand the moving parts.

05:04.290 --> 05:07.459
- And come right at it.
- So then, why did that rig explode?

05:07.460 --> 05:09.619
I have no idea.

05:09.620 --> 05:12.079
But I know it wasn't his fault.

05:12.080 --> 05:15.119
He was a scapegoat
for a greedy corporation.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.579
They know that dead men
can't fight back.

05:17.580 --> 05:18.790
Okay, so then how can we?

05:20.670 --> 05:22.749
We can ask for help.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.960
From someone who knows what to look for?

05:26.170 --> 05:27.879
Your boyfriend.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.419
Look, I know that Greg
is rough around the edges,

05:30.420 --> 05:31.749
but he's a real lawyer.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.579
- And he's a good one.
- Mom.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.379
He chased your cop away yesterday.

05:35.380 --> 05:36.709
Stop.

05:36.710 --> 05:40.619
There is no upside to going against
a corporation like ROXXON.

05:40.620 --> 05:43.119
Mom, you have put your life
on hold for the past eight years

05:43.120 --> 05:46.249
waiting for a windfall
that's never gonna come.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.829
Honey, it's gonna come.

05:48.830 --> 05:50.789
You have to have hope.

05:50.790 --> 05:52.829
Well, if hope exists...

05:52.830 --> 05:55.619
I don't think that that looks like Greg.

05:55.620 --> 05:57.539
Because Greg is just another married guy

05:57.540 --> 05:58.919
who's gonna tell you
whatever you wanna hear

05:58.920 --> 06:00.330
because he thinks you have a great ass.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.039
This never turns out well,
you know that, right?

06:10.080 --> 06:12.580
Hey! Brought groceries.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.380
I'll put 'em over here.

06:23.790 --> 06:25.789
Wow.

06:25.790 --> 06:26.920
They're beautiful.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.460
What?

06:49.460 --> 06:50.789
What? You want me to slow down?

06:50.790 --> 06:52.170
No, no. Green light.

06:53.460 --> 06:55.959
Just wondering who this new Tyrone is.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.790
Who's to say this isn't the real me?

07:11.880 --> 07:13.920
<i>There's something
about fear that pushes me.</i>

07:16.120 --> 07:17.500
Has my whole life.

07:18.580 --> 07:20.040
I think that's what I saw in you.

07:21.750 --> 07:24.039
With your dad and ROXXON.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.539
It's kinda like your
darkest fear is playing out.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.829
Has this ever happened to you before me?

07:28.830 --> 07:31.789
Yeah. One time with my mom.

07:31.790 --> 07:33.540
And before that.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.620
I think the guy who killed my brother.

07:38.620 --> 07:39.580
He was a cop, right?

07:40.920 --> 07:42.170
The guy who shot your brother?

07:43.750 --> 07:44.580
How'd you know that?

07:46.710 --> 07:48.210
Because I can do it too.

07:52.580 --> 07:54.620
Good thing I brought
enough fajitas for an army.

07:55.790 --> 07:57.709
It's a nice surprise
finding you here, Miss Tandy.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.670
Mm-hmm.

07:58.671 --> 08:00.959
You know, I was taking
a look at that front yard.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.669
I was thinking, maybe this weekend,

08:02.670 --> 08:04.619
we could go out there
and maybe pitch in.

08:04.620 --> 08:05.999
Clear it out a little bit.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.669
There's a lot of debris
all over the place.

08:07.670 --> 08:09.789
Like chains and things all out there.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.169
I was thinking maybe
we could move all that out.

08:12.170 --> 08:14.419
Maybe plant a garden?

08:14.420 --> 08:16.539
Make our own peppers.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.379
You wanna chop some?

08:18.380 --> 08:19.499
So what's your angle here?

08:19.500 --> 08:20.709
Side piece?

08:20.710 --> 08:22.459
Ambulance chasing,

08:22.460 --> 08:25.330
or are you just straight-up,
everyday con man?

08:26.710 --> 08:29.499
Con man's bit of a
sexist word, don't you think?

08:29.500 --> 08:30.959
I mean, girls can play too, right?

08:30.960 --> 08:33.708
I mean, I saw inside that bag.

08:33.710 --> 08:35.539
I started out as a
public defender, you know.

08:36.539 --> 08:38.379
You're not perfect.

08:38.380 --> 08:39.919
Neither am I, trust me, but...

08:39.919 --> 08:41.619
your mom?

08:41.620 --> 08:43.249
She's pretty important to me.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.329
So I hope you'll be patient with me.

08:45.330 --> 08:47.329
<i>Sometimes when I touch someone...</i>

08:47.330 --> 08:48.959
skin to skin...

08:48.960 --> 08:50.210
I don't know.

08:51.670 --> 08:53.619
I see something.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.579
You can see people's fears too?

08:55.580 --> 08:57.209
No.

08:57.210 --> 08:59.169
Not their fears.

08:59.170 --> 09:02.289
<i>Ironically, I can see their hopes.</i>

09:02.290 --> 09:05.000
You know what,
I will slice up those peppers.

09:12.670 --> 09:14.459
I'm not gonna lie.

09:14.460 --> 09:17.420
I can't wait to work
in that new chef's kitchen.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.919
Well, the contractor says two weeks.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.999
That probably means three.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.959
I also can't wait to
carry you over that threshold.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.420
Well, you've earned it.

09:28.620 --> 09:31.079
Tandy, you mind passing me the cilantro?

09:31.080 --> 09:32.120
Thank you.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.789
Tandy?

09:36.790 --> 09:39.289
You mind passing me the...

09:39.290 --> 09:40.330
cilantro.

09:41.666 --> 09:43.126
You must've done this before.

10:10.171 --> 10:12.631
<i>Character is what you do
when no one else is watching.</i>

10:14.640 --> 10:16.769
Is that from some philosophy book?

10:16.770 --> 10:18.019
No.

10:18.020 --> 10:19.310
My dad used to say that.

10:21.350 --> 10:22.729
Give me your wallet.

10:22.730 --> 10:23.849
Why don't you just steal it again?

10:23.850 --> 10:25.230
I could if I wanted to.

10:26.770 --> 10:29.019
Alright, this is some type of violation.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.560
You were inside my head.

10:35.390 --> 10:36.809
Student ID.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.849
St. Sebastian's Preparatory.

10:38.850 --> 10:40.269
Juice Stop punch card.

10:40.270 --> 10:43.349
Credit card... in Mom's name.

10:43.350 --> 10:45.809
Stripe and chip unmolested.

10:45.810 --> 10:47.769
You don't wanna take their money.

10:47.770 --> 10:50.559
Possibly because you're flushed with...

10:50.560 --> 10:51.809
$8.00 in cash.

10:51.810 --> 10:54.269
Wouldn't have got that much
off me if you did steal it.

10:54.270 --> 10:56.810
You don't make money by taking wallets.

10:58.560 --> 10:59.809
You get to know people.

10:59.810 --> 11:01.769
That's how you get your cop.

11:01.770 --> 11:04.729
- Get your justice.
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

11:04.730 --> 11:06.969
Steal his wallet? Take his badge?

11:06.970 --> 11:10.270
No, but you should
definitely find out who he is.

11:11.350 --> 11:12.889
Maybe go to the station house.

11:12.890 --> 11:14.729
I-I can't walk into a police station.

11:14.730 --> 11:15.769
Why not?

11:15.770 --> 11:18.019
I watched one of them shoot my brother.

11:18.020 --> 11:20.559
On... on top of that...

11:20.560 --> 11:22.059
I'm a young black man in the South.

11:22.060 --> 11:23.679
They see me, they see a thug.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.969
So then, don't be a thug.

11:25.970 --> 11:27.139
Be a victim.

11:27.140 --> 11:28.640
Remember how I got this from you?

11:30.100 --> 11:31.519
Yeah.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.729
Yeah, you lied to me.

11:32.730 --> 11:34.429
I didn't just lie.

11:34.430 --> 11:36.729
<i>I constructed a narrative</i>

11:36.730 --> 11:38.469
<i>that made you feel safe.</i>

11:38.470 --> 11:40.019
<i>I reeled you in.</i>

11:40.020 --> 11:41.849
<i>Just do the same.</i>

11:41.850 --> 11:43.639
<i>What kind of narrative
am I supposed to create</i>

11:43.640 --> 11:45.519
<i>to get to a cop?</i>

11:45.520 --> 11:48.559
<i>♪ So come on home and sing with me ♪</i>

11:48.560 --> 11:51.599
<i>♪ We'll live like

12:16.390 --> 12:17.599
Tandy!

12:17.600 --> 12:19.229
Surprised to see you here.

12:19.230 --> 12:20.969
I have a couple questions to ask you.

12:20.970 --> 12:22.429
About ROXXON.

12:22.430 --> 12:23.769
You mean about the, uh,

12:23.770 --> 12:25.679
the big con that
I'm pulling on your mom?

12:25.680 --> 12:27.679
Look Greg, if you're doing it,

12:27.680 --> 12:28.680
for real...

12:30.350 --> 12:31.769
I wanna understand it.

12:31.770 --> 12:33.269
Maybe help.

12:33.270 --> 12:35.229
Okay. Well, I've never
turned down free help.

12:35.230 --> 12:36.769
So, what do you have on him?

12:36.770 --> 12:38.849
Well, your mom, she told
me everything she could

12:38.850 --> 12:40.139
about your dad's albatross.

12:40.140 --> 12:41.809
That rig off the coast
that went haywire.

12:41.810 --> 12:43.639
Yeah. I know it.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.599
Well, anyway, ROXXON, they, uh...

12:45.600 --> 12:48.099
They closed the case on it,
but they didn't let it die.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.639
They kept feeding the beast.

12:49.640 --> 12:52.639
All for a pile of scrap metal
underwater.

12:52.640 --> 12:55.180
Zoning permits, federal grants.

12:58.730 --> 13:00.729
Payments for those,
they led to routing numbers,

13:00.730 --> 13:04.179
and those routing numbers,
they led to a shell corp.

13:04.180 --> 13:07.229
Seems like a lot of effort
to keep a failed project.

13:07.230 --> 13:08.969
Why not just bury it with my dad?

13:08.970 --> 13:11.469
That is the million dollar question.

13:11.470 --> 13:13.179
You know, the answer, I wager,

13:13.180 --> 13:15.559
is that these ROXXON guys
are million dollar assholes.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.560
Yeah, I know the kind.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.639
And these guys, they're running all kind

13:20.640 --> 13:22.269
of personal shit
through company coffers.

13:22.270 --> 13:23.930
They're leaving a big paper trail.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.769
Maybe it's not just paper.

13:32.770 --> 13:33.969
Maybe these younger guys

13:33.970 --> 13:36.639
have Instagram and Snapchat, right?

13:36.640 --> 13:39.099
Boys love to show off their toys.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.230
Yeah.

13:41.270 --> 13:42.769
I'm glad you're here.

13:42.770 --> 13:44.519
I mean, this'll be good
for your mom, too.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.270
It's about time she gets a win, right?

13:47.600 --> 13:49.560
So, you got another desk
or should I use the floor?

13:53.970 --> 13:56.519
Ma'am, we got two
cars headed towards you now.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.850
Yes, ma'am.

13:58.850 --> 14:00.349
Can I help you, son?

14:00.350 --> 14:03.599
Yeah, um, somebody
stole my bike on Carrolton.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.430
- I got pictures.
- Stolen bike.

14:07.390 --> 14:09.519
Yeah, by the Rue de la Course.

14:09.520 --> 14:10.679
On Carrolton, got it.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.179
Hannigan!

14:12.180 --> 14:14.599
Somebody took his bike.
You wanna write it up?

14:14.600 --> 14:15.730
Yeah, okay.

14:16.680 --> 14:17.982
Yes, ma'am.

14:24.350 --> 14:25.470
Follow me.

14:37.770 --> 14:40.349
I'll be right back. Need to grab a form.

15:17.310 --> 15:19.140
Hey, you take care of those
things you had to do?

15:20.470 --> 15:21.559
Listen, Dad, I'm...

15:21.560 --> 15:24.096
- Sorry if I...
- Alright, fine. Don't even worry about it.

15:24.680 --> 15:27.139
I was in a bit of a mood too.

15:27.140 --> 15:29.599
Right after you left,
I had it in my mind to...

15:29.600 --> 15:31.179
take that door off the hinges.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.969
Could you believe that?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.470
Got myself all the way
out to the tool shed.

15:44.060 --> 15:46.100
I happened to notice that
my bolt-cutters are missing.

15:47.810 --> 15:49.470
You know anything about that?

15:50.520 --> 15:52.389
No, sir, I don't.

15:52.390 --> 15:53.560
You sure?

16:13.390 --> 16:15.309
This is how it all started
with your brother.

16:15.310 --> 16:16.639
It's not what you think.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.599
I think there's only two things
you can do with bolt-cutters.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.769
Steal something or break into something.

16:21.770 --> 16:24.179
- I didn't do either!
- You expect me to believe that?

16:24.180 --> 16:25.559
I expect you to understand

16:25.560 --> 16:26.930
when it's none of your business, Dad.

16:28.970 --> 16:30.770
Boy...

16:32.176 --> 16:34.336
Come on. Right now!

16:36.430 --> 16:38.349
Right now!

16:44.342 --> 16:45.881
I don't know how it works.

16:45.968 --> 16:47.347
It has a mind of its own.

16:47.375 --> 16:49.204
One day, I'm here, the next, I'm...

16:49.205 --> 16:50.704
In front of my car?

16:50.705 --> 16:52.294
On a roof.

16:52.295 --> 16:54.794
Or in a trunk full of cocaine.

16:54.795 --> 16:57.084
Seems like it always brings
you right back to that cop.

16:57.085 --> 16:58.745
Or to you.

17:02.495 --> 17:04.319
It takes me to you.

17:04.376 --> 17:06.685
So it shows you what you need to see.

17:06.797 --> 17:07.872
Guides you.

17:07.912 --> 17:09.834
Yeah, but more than that,
it protects me.

17:10.342 --> 17:12.665
Kinda like it's...
it's looking out for me.

17:14.915 --> 17:16.204
You know, like a...

17:20.415 --> 17:22.875
So, um, what about you and your, uh...

17:26.744 --> 17:27.994
I don't know.

17:30.495 --> 17:32.204
Stuff hits the fan,

17:32.205 --> 17:34.834
car hits the tree, and at that moment...

17:34.835 --> 17:36.874
when all hope slips away,

17:36.875 --> 17:39.994
I get all hot and bothered
and weaponized.

17:39.995 --> 17:43.294
If I had a knife of light, Detective
Connors would be dead and buried.

17:43.295 --> 17:45.994
If I could travel anywhere,
I'd travel anywhere but here.

17:45.995 --> 17:47.995
Maybe that's why we got what we got.

17:49.415 --> 17:51.955
Or why we didn't get what we didn't get.

17:55.745 --> 17:56.994
What?

17:56.995 --> 18:00.294
This all started the night we
touched in the graveyard, right?

18:00.295 --> 18:01.874
Uh-huh.

18:01.875 --> 18:03.625
What happens if we touch again?

18:07.835 --> 18:09.034
Let's test our limits.

18:11.835 --> 18:13.994
Now, look here.

18:13.995 --> 18:15.994
Don't say a word to no one,

18:15.995 --> 18:17.494
unless somebody
asks you something first.

18:17.495 --> 18:18.954
You understand me?

18:53.915 --> 18:56.705
Get back, get back for the Big Chief!

18:57.915 --> 18:59.915
Wild Red Hawks about to meet!

19:01.085 --> 19:03.875
We gonna step real high
on white folks' street.

19:04.995 --> 19:06.915
Wild Red Hawks about to meet!

19:07.835 --> 19:11.294
Spy Boy Otis done sharp his knife!

19:11.295 --> 19:14.744
Wild Red Hawks on prowl tonight!

19:18.205 --> 19:21.124
I'm Big Chief Roland Duplantier

19:21.125 --> 19:25.164
of the Wild Red Hawks of the 9th Ward.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.834
Baddest in all of New Orleans!

19:27.835 --> 19:29.204
Who you is?

19:29.305 --> 19:32.474
I the Spy Boy Otis
of the Wild Red Hawks.

19:32.475 --> 19:35.434
Been off the trail,
but got my eyes sharp,

19:35.435 --> 19:37.014
and my knife sharper.

19:37.015 --> 19:38.894
Ain't my Spy Boy.

19:38.895 --> 19:41.264
My Spy Boy know where home is.

19:41.265 --> 19:44.264
My Spy Boy don't wear no shoes like that.

19:44.265 --> 19:46.764
Must be from that 7th Ward.

19:46.765 --> 19:48.094
High falutin'.

19:48.095 --> 19:50.434
- Right, right.
- What y'all say?

19:50.435 --> 19:53.934
Should we beat his ass
back to the other side of Canal?

19:57.895 --> 19:59.185
The hell with that.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.435
I got a mind to cut your throat myself.

20:15.055 --> 20:17.685
If my hands wasn't so shaky.

20:21.805 --> 20:24.094
Where you been hidin', Otis?

20:24.095 --> 20:26.725
- Been too long.
- Way too long, bro.

20:49.305 --> 20:51.474
- So you're married?
- Mm-hmm.

20:51.475 --> 20:53.135
So how does that work?

20:54.265 --> 20:55.844
Not very well.

20:55.845 --> 20:58.344
Thought that I could
rescue her, you know.

20:58.345 --> 20:59.684
Guess I like to be needed.

20:59.685 --> 21:01.014
You like needy women.

21:01.015 --> 21:02.974
So, no kids?

21:02.975 --> 21:04.725
No. Janey was enough to handle.

21:05.935 --> 21:08.844
And you know, our situation, it's, uh...

21:08.845 --> 21:10.474
It's all over except the paperwork.

21:10.475 --> 21:12.594
Now, I... I know what you think.

21:12.595 --> 21:14.844
You don't know what I think.

21:14.845 --> 21:17.435
It's just that, your mom
and I, you know, we, uh...

21:19.055 --> 21:20.725
just laugh about the dumbest shit.

21:22.685 --> 21:24.844
You know, it's nice
to have somebody that...

21:24.845 --> 21:26.304
you can talk to.

21:26.305 --> 21:28.804
You know, honestly.

21:28.805 --> 21:31.934
<i>In my opinion, in my experience,</i>

21:31.935 --> 21:34.474
<i>it's dangerous to get close to anyone.</i>

21:34.475 --> 21:36.895
But with you, I'm conclusively right.

21:37.805 --> 21:39.804
When we touch...

21:39.805 --> 21:41.095
shit goes boom.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.475
So, the first question is...

21:47.895 --> 21:49.054
how close can we get to each other

21:49.055 --> 21:50.724
without triggering our crazy?

21:53.015 --> 21:55.264
And how we gonna do that?

21:55.265 --> 21:58.135
Close your eyes. Don't move.

22:01.845 --> 22:03.225
And no cheating.

22:27.265 --> 22:28.935
- That was...
- What?

22:29.935 --> 22:31.185
That was...

22:33.015 --> 22:34.225
nice.

22:35.185 --> 22:36.725
At first.

22:42.725 --> 22:44.724
- Where'd you get these?
- Just right around the corner.

22:44.725 --> 22:46.634
- Yours good?
- Perfect.

22:46.635 --> 22:47.895
Alright.

22:53.635 --> 22:54.635
You should get that.

22:57.265 --> 22:59.974
No, there's no reason to.

22:59.975 --> 23:01.265
She's your wife.

23:02.305 --> 23:03.635
I'm sure it's important.

23:05.435 --> 23:06.684
It's fine.

23:13.685 --> 23:14.805
Excuse me.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.435
Hello?

23:20.475 --> 23:21.685
Yeah.

23:23.015 --> 23:24.765
No, I'm not...
I'm not doing this right now.

23:29.305 --> 23:31.054
Sorry.

23:31.055 --> 23:33.184
You know what, I'm not feeling too hot.

23:33.185 --> 23:34.816
I... You didn't hardly eat anything.

23:34.841 --> 23:35.894
You want me to go
get you something else?

23:35.895 --> 23:37.224
You know, I think I'm gonna go to bed.

23:37.225 --> 23:39.014
And, uh, I have that
job interview in the morning.

23:39.015 --> 23:42.634
- You do?
- Yep! So, I am, uh...

23:42.635 --> 23:44.934
gonna say my goodnights and take leave.

23:52.726 --> 23:54.055
You want leftovers?

23:55.395 --> 23:58.224
No, why don't we take 'em to the office?

23:58.225 --> 24:00.185
We'll be hungry tomorrow.

24:01.135 --> 24:02.435
Yeah.

24:04.058 --> 24:05.282
Yeah.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.595
He was getting trained up
to be the next Spy Boy.

24:41.635 --> 24:43.015
What's a Spy Boy?

24:44.135 --> 24:45.395
Your daddy ain't told you?

24:48.395 --> 24:50.934
The Spy Boy travels fast...

24:50.935 --> 24:53.344
across great distances.

24:53.345 --> 24:55.804
He runs out into the unknown...

24:55.805 --> 24:57.514
unprotected,

24:57.515 --> 24:59.434
where nobody can see.

24:59.435 --> 25:02.135
Looking for trouble
so we all know what's coming.

25:04.225 --> 25:06.594
Each bead has its place.

25:06.595 --> 25:08.055
Part of a larger design.

25:09.297 --> 25:10.716
Here you got to pay attention,

25:10.741 --> 25:12.554
'cause if you mess up,

25:12.555 --> 25:13.864
and you don't notice till later,

25:13.889 --> 25:16.434
then you gotta undo hours...

25:16.435 --> 25:17.514
days...

25:17.515 --> 25:19.054
even months of work.

25:19.055 --> 25:20.594
I mean, it's no joke.

25:20.595 --> 25:23.094
Takes years to develop
the mastery of bead-work.

25:23.095 --> 25:25.475
And each year,
you gotta remaster it again.

25:26.515 --> 25:28.130
You gotta make a new one every year?

25:28.155 --> 25:30.395
I mean, every year,
you a new person, son.

25:31.395 --> 25:33.474
So, we spend that time...

25:33.475 --> 25:35.094
working on a new suit.

25:35.095 --> 25:38.054
Some give up and never finish.

25:38.055 --> 25:40.054
There's a room over there...

25:40.055 --> 25:41.554
full of failure stories.

25:41.555 --> 25:43.225
It can drive a man crazy.

25:44.225 --> 25:47.434
But not the man with patience...

25:47.435 --> 25:48.634
diligence...

25:48.635 --> 25:50.135
and of grace.

25:51.345 --> 25:52.725
Control of your actions, son.

25:54.685 --> 25:56.474
If you can't control yourself,

25:56.475 --> 25:59.684
then you can't control
a damn thing in this world.

25:59.685 --> 26:03.474
<i>This regalia, it helps us
find that control.</i>

26:03.475 --> 26:06.134
<i>And with it comes the strength we need.</i>

26:33.915 --> 26:37.062
The first time the
knife came out, I felt...

26:37.165 --> 26:38.495
I don't know...

26:39.718 --> 26:41.298
Like some kinda release?

26:42.103 --> 26:43.353
Yeah.

26:44.494 --> 26:46.123
Exactly.

26:46.194 --> 26:48.154
Like sex, you know?

26:52.672 --> 26:54.211
So, who did you tell?

26:54.212 --> 26:55.541
Are you kidding me? No one.

26:55.542 --> 26:56.953
- No one?
- No.

26:57.922 --> 26:59.976
Who would get it?

27:00.171 --> 27:02.590
You don't have a girlfriend?

27:02.591 --> 27:04.090
I mean, you gotta
with those eyes, right?

27:05.631 --> 27:06.921
No.

27:08.261 --> 27:10.300
Well...

27:10.301 --> 27:12.720
maybe, I guess, I...

27:12.721 --> 27:14.171
Not really sure what to call her.

27:15.841 --> 27:18.221
But I haven't told her about my thing.

27:22.107 --> 27:23.197
What about you?

27:25.067 --> 27:26.067
I had a...

27:27.027 --> 27:28.866
sorta partner.

27:30.317 --> 27:31.527
What does that mean?

27:32.527 --> 27:33.907
It means I didn't tell him.

27:36.407 --> 27:37.817
Like you said...

27:39.107 --> 27:40.947
no one would really get it, would they?

27:42.027 --> 27:43.406
Who would?

27:43.407 --> 27:44.487
Billy would.

27:45.607 --> 27:47.317
I would've told my dad.

27:49.907 --> 27:51.156
No matter what I did,

27:51.157 --> 27:53.196
he always saw the best version of me.

27:53.197 --> 27:54.656
What about your mom?

27:54.657 --> 27:56.907
She can't even get
her own life together.

27:58.527 --> 28:00.366
What about your mom and dad?

28:00.367 --> 28:02.566
My parents look at me
like a liar and a thief

28:02.567 --> 28:03.777
ever since I was eight.

28:05.657 --> 28:06.777
They don't trust me.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.946
Not really.

28:09.947 --> 28:11.367
You know, ever since that night.

28:33.107 --> 28:34.566
Hey, hey, put that away.

28:34.567 --> 28:36.316
What? I thought this was
just one of the throwaways.

28:36.317 --> 28:37.816
No. Just give it here, son. Now.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.566
You said most of these were unfinished.

28:39.567 --> 28:41.866
Maybe I could finish this one
and march with you guys.

28:41.867 --> 28:43.866
That's not gonna happen.
Why'd you pick this one?

28:43.867 --> 28:44.867
I don't know.

28:47.487 --> 28:48.907
It spoke to me, I guess.

28:52.157 --> 28:53.407
That was your brother's.

28:58.067 --> 29:00.406
I'll finish it for Billy.

29:00.407 --> 29:01.907
I owe him that. I'll make it perfect.

29:03.317 --> 29:04.697
Then I'll march for him.

29:12.107 --> 29:13.447
Hey.

29:14.817 --> 29:16.316
Preparing for that job interview?

29:16.317 --> 29:18.947
We both know there isn't one.

29:22.947 --> 29:24.277
I think you were right.

29:25.567 --> 29:27.777
- About what?
- About Greg.

29:29.987 --> 29:33.606
He's... a nice guy. He's not an idiot.

29:33.607 --> 29:35.112
I mean, he's working his ass off

29:35.136 --> 29:36.446
- on this case for you.
- Tandy.

29:36.447 --> 29:37.878
You were right the first time.

29:37.907 --> 29:40.486
He is just like the rest of them.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.866
Mom, I don't think that's true.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.487
Well, it doesn't really
matter what you think.

29:45.907 --> 29:47.412
I just broke up with him.

30:12.277 --> 30:14.656
<i>I don't know what
you gotta be so afraid of.</i>

30:14.657 --> 30:15.946
<i>You seem strong.</i>

30:15.947 --> 30:17.656
<i>Wiley and honest.</i>

30:17.657 --> 30:20.196
Maybe that's what's wrong with you.

30:20.197 --> 30:22.446
You're probably too honest.

30:22.447 --> 30:24.277
- Is there such a thing?
- There is.

30:26.317 --> 30:28.277
But it hangs off your shoulders nicely.

30:30.737 --> 30:32.656
I don't think you live here by accident.

30:32.657 --> 30:33.777
What do you mean?

30:35.277 --> 30:36.776
I think you believe in hope.

30:36.777 --> 30:38.316
What?

30:38.317 --> 30:40.447
I mean, you should. I think you should.
You're smart.

30:41.907 --> 30:44.406
And you know how to live in this world.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.736
You know, it's not nothing.

30:46.737 --> 30:48.196
And it's not ironic.

30:48.197 --> 30:49.527
You and hope.

30:56.697 --> 30:59.156
What are we gonna do, Tyrone Johnson?

31:03.197 --> 31:04.777
I don't know, Tandy Bowen.

31:07.157 --> 31:09.657
The universe keeps pushing us together.

31:10.737 --> 31:13.067
The universe keeps pulling us apart.

31:14.607 --> 31:16.566
Anyway...

31:16.567 --> 31:18.737
it's nice to have someone to talk to.

32:13.064 --> 32:14.274
Uh, no, thanks.

32:15.347 --> 32:16.686
Come on.

32:16.687 --> 32:18.686
Don't altar boys drink communion wine?

32:19.897 --> 32:21.267
I'm not an altar boy.

32:22.977 --> 32:23.977
I'm in church choir.

32:25.107 --> 32:26.847
Of course you are.

32:30.607 --> 32:33.056
You know it's called "survivor's guilt."

32:33.057 --> 32:34.607
What we have.

32:35.767 --> 32:37.807
According to my priest anyway.

32:39.897 --> 32:41.847
Can't have God without guilt.

32:43.017 --> 32:44.517
Or vice versa.

32:47.057 --> 32:49.186
Do you...

32:49.187 --> 32:50.647
feel guilty?

32:53.267 --> 32:54.557
Yeah.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.806
Is that what all those
checks were about?

32:57.807 --> 32:59.936
What checks?

32:59.937 --> 33:01.936
People kept handing you checks

33:01.937 --> 33:03.727
every time you did something.

33:06.557 --> 33:09.306
You just... held onto them.

33:09.307 --> 33:11.346
You were drowning in 'em.

33:11.347 --> 33:13.847
That's crazy. Someone gives
you a check, you cash it.

33:15.477 --> 33:17.187
I think it was some kind of...

33:18.687 --> 33:20.517
I don't know, metaphor?

33:22.147 --> 33:25.017
For your feeling
that you didn't deserve it.

33:26.147 --> 33:28.267
That you don't deserve anything good.

33:30.847 --> 33:32.767
Like you're atoning for something.

33:36.847 --> 33:38.347
I feel like...

33:39.517 --> 33:41.147
I have to be perfect.

33:42.727 --> 33:44.687
Like I have to do everything right.

33:46.847 --> 33:48.846
Like...

33:48.847 --> 33:50.806
like I'm trying to make up
for two lives.

33:50.807 --> 33:52.896
You know?

33:52.897 --> 33:54.477
I go the other way.

33:57.437 --> 33:58.807
What other way?

34:05.557 --> 34:07.557
I wish I was the one who died.

34:16.847 --> 34:17.896
Mom?

34:20.226 --> 34:23.726
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

34:23.726 --> 34:25.726
I was just scared.

34:25.726 --> 34:27.976
And stupid.

34:27.976 --> 34:30.346
You know how I can be.

34:30.347 --> 34:32.056
Because you know who I am.

34:33.976 --> 34:37.436
Anyway, sixth message.

34:37.437 --> 34:39.306
Just give me a call back.

34:40.607 --> 34:42.226
I think we should give it another go.

34:52.726 --> 34:55.436
This fancy-ass Airedale Terrier.

34:56.687 --> 34:58.896
The police roll up on us.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.226
Choo Choo started
running from the Superdome.

35:01.227 --> 35:03.936
That boy didn't stop until
he got to Audubon Park.

35:05.727 --> 35:07.226
- Hey.
- Good morning.

35:07.227 --> 35:08.806
Now, what's so funny?

35:08.807 --> 35:10.437
- Oh...
- Nothing.

35:11.517 --> 35:13.556
Ah, Tyrone made breakfast.

35:13.557 --> 35:14.847
Come on, Mom. Try it.

35:16.017 --> 35:17.557
You...

35:18.767 --> 35:20.806
Cooked.

35:20.807 --> 35:22.056
<i>Can't be that bad.</i>

35:22.057 --> 35:25.646
You know, it just...
it can never be that bad.

35:25.647 --> 35:27.606
Sometimes it is.

35:27.607 --> 35:29.686
You know, sometimes that's just life.

35:29.888 --> 35:31.968
You know that little girl
in the church you saw?

35:33.163 --> 35:35.203
Passing out roofies
like communion candy?

35:36.048 --> 35:37.217
Yeah?

35:37.218 --> 35:38.508
That's me.

35:39.718 --> 35:41.347
That's how I get by.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.887
Or what I need to do
for some sick reason,

35:43.933 --> 35:45.553
and I don't know what's worse.

35:46.593 --> 35:47.893
But killing yourself?

35:49.183 --> 35:50.853
I think about it a lot.

35:52.183 --> 35:53.643
What the hell is wrong with you?

35:54.683 --> 35:56.932
You have a life, and...
and opportunities,

35:56.933 --> 35:58.893
and you wanna waste it
by killing yourself?

36:00.183 --> 36:02.592
No, I didn't say
I wanted to kill myself.

36:02.593 --> 36:03.973
- I just...
- No, I heard what you said!

36:06.093 --> 36:07.762
Look...

36:07.763 --> 36:10.013
your life isn't that bad, okay?

36:10.803 --> 36:12.473
Where do you live, Tyrone?

36:13.763 --> 36:15.092
Good house?

36:15.093 --> 36:16.762
Good neighbors, you go to a good school.

36:16.763 --> 36:17.802
You don't know me.

36:17.803 --> 36:19.972
I'm sorry that your two living parents

36:19.973 --> 36:21.972
care about you so much.

36:21.973 --> 36:23.552
Must be a real drag, sway.

36:23.553 --> 36:26.092
What? You gonna teach me how to lie?

36:26.093 --> 36:28.852
You gonna teach me how to be a con man?

36:28.853 --> 36:30.182
Let me check your privilege.

36:30.183 --> 36:32.642
My privilege?

36:32.643 --> 36:35.392
I was just dropped off by a cop

36:35.393 --> 36:37.392
who told me that I can't press charges

36:37.393 --> 36:38.762
against a guy who almost...

36:41.393 --> 36:43.183
I've had a lot of things taken from me.

36:45.223 --> 36:47.302
And everything I have,
I've had to steal,

36:47.303 --> 36:48.803
- because...
- 'Cause you can!

36:49.803 --> 36:51.352
You can walk into
any room in this world,

36:51.353 --> 36:53.512
and never be questioned.

36:53.513 --> 36:56.262
Try walking into a department
store looking like me!

36:56.263 --> 36:57.802
That's not fair, because I don't...

36:57.803 --> 36:59.263
The world does!

37:02.853 --> 37:04.932
Look, this whole country's
trying to kill me

37:04.933 --> 37:06.393
every day.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.932
So excuse me, if I can't
afford to sit around

37:09.933 --> 37:11.992
and contemplate suicide!

37:12.933 --> 37:14.763
You know what, you wanna die so bad...

37:15.723 --> 37:17.433
why don't you just do it?

37:22.593 --> 37:25.263
You know, you forgot that
I walked through your hopes, Ty.

37:27.593 --> 37:28.763
Your hopes.

37:31.013 --> 37:32.353
And you know what I saw?

37:34.593 --> 37:37.972
I saw a kid committing suicide by cop.

37:37.973 --> 37:40.853
Over and over again.

37:42.803 --> 37:44.852
You wanna know what I think?

37:44.853 --> 37:45.973
Go to hell.

37:49.643 --> 37:52.592
You have your own death wish, choir boy!

37:52.593 --> 37:54.392
So how about you go to hell?
