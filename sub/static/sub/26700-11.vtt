WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:04.504
Previously on Legacies...
Europe was amazing.

00:04.504 --> 00:05.756
It's chaos around here.

00:05.756 --> 00:07.382
Yesterday I came into
possession

00:07.382 --> 00:09.718
of another Malivore artifact.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.470
Now monsters
that shouldn't exist

00:11.470 --> 00:12.930
have been coming after it.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.182
Where is Hope?
She was in my dream.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.100
What was Hope doing
in your dream?
RAFAEL: The usual,

00:17.100 --> 00:18.560
just being a badass.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.355
I'm not gonna be afraid
of losing you anymore, Hope.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.232
'Cause I'm gonna be the guy
who always fights...

00:23.232 --> 00:24.608
to find you again.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.610
What's all that?
I was thinking we could

00:26.610 --> 00:28.028
spell a barrier around the urn.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.405
So the next monster
shows up, we can trap it.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.577
(bell ringing)

00:38.664 --> 00:40.874
Sounds like the
trap worked.

00:43.794 --> 00:44.920
I know this is important,

00:44.920 --> 00:47.130
but you couldn't have
put pants on first?

00:47.130 --> 00:49.091
Little early for snark, Hope.

00:49.091 --> 00:51.385
Any guesses on what
famous monster

00:51.385 --> 00:52.719
from filmland we
get to slay today?

00:52.719 --> 00:55.097
(scoffs) With our
luck, it'll be Cthulhu.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.890
(horse sputters)

00:56.890 --> 00:58.183
False alarm.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.893
It's just a horse.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.522
Must've gotten out
of the stables

01:03.522 --> 01:05.148
and wandered across
the barrier spell.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.359
HOPE: Except we don't have
a white horse.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.531
(gasps)

01:14.866 --> 01:15.909
Hey, wait, wait.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.744
Hold your fire.
It's a monster, Hope.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.371
It's here to take
the artifact.
You're not seriously

01:19.371 --> 01:22.040
suggesting we kill a unicorn?
I'm suggesting

01:22.040 --> 01:23.959
we don't give it a
pass because it's cute.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.252
Can't we just...

01:25.252 --> 01:27.254
leave it alone?

01:27.254 --> 01:28.797
It's trapped,
it's not going anywhere.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.257
It's harmless.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.847
ALARIC: Hope's right.
As long as we keep it alive,

01:36.847 --> 01:39.266
other creatures
won't be coming for the urn.

01:39.266 --> 01:42.853
(slug squeaking)
So we just stay alert

01:42.853 --> 01:44.313
and let it be.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.442
(slug squeals)

01:50.027 --> 01:51.653
DORIAN:
All right, well,

01:51.653 --> 01:54.364
I'll be on alert
back in bed.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.616
(Dorian sighs)

01:56.616 --> 01:57.909
(exhales)

02:02.831 --> 02:04.750
(slug chittering)

02:19.848 --> 02:21.808
(birds chirping)

02:41.828 --> 02:43.622
Morning, handsome.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.082
Hey.
Handsomes.

02:45.082 --> 02:48.043
Mmm.
Sweet, sweet carbs.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.461
Somebody's in a
really good mood.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.670
Hmm. Just woke up

02:50.670 --> 02:52.506
on the right side
of the bed, I guess.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.840
For the first time ever?
(giggles)

02:53.840 --> 02:56.176
You're so funny.
I love that about you.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.100
Remember what Mom said.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.643
We are airy clouds

03:04.643 --> 03:07.771
floating high above
a turbulent sea of drama.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.564
Two clouds who
are not triggered

03:09.564 --> 03:10.857
by seeing ex-boyfriends.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.692
LIZZIE:
Who also do not

03:12.692 --> 03:14.736
make out with ex-girlfriends.

03:14.736 --> 03:17.155
Hmm.
Thanks to Mom,

03:17.155 --> 03:18.698
I have a silver lining.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.826
Saltzman Twins 2.0.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.791
Good morning,

03:27.791 --> 03:29.167
Rafael.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.669
Hi.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.130
Uh, how was
your-your trip?

03:33.130 --> 03:34.423
Excellent.

03:34.423 --> 03:35.424
Thank you.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.591
And welcome back, Landon.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.718
Didn't you vote me out?

03:38.718 --> 03:40.053
That's all in the past.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.390
Now, is everyone as excited
as I am about tonight?

03:43.390 --> 03:44.724
What's happening tonight?

03:44.724 --> 03:47.227
(laughs) The school's
annual talent show.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.645
All the factions compete.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.647
You know, the witch performance
wouldn't be the same

03:50.647 --> 03:52.274
without you two.
Thank you.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.316
(chuckles)

03:53.316 --> 03:54.651
(musical chime)

03:54.651 --> 03:57.320
If I could have your attention.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.490
Last night we were able
to capture a monster

04:00.490 --> 04:01.867
here on the grounds.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.452
We have everything
under control.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.537
But given this potential danger,

04:05.537 --> 04:07.581
it is with a heavy heart

04:07.581 --> 04:09.708
that I must postpone
the talent show.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.959
(students groaning)
Hopefully,

04:10.959 --> 04:13.003
we'll be able
to reschedule this...

04:13.003 --> 04:15.881
unique event... at a later date.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.594
A much, much later date.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.845
(chuckles)

04:21.845 --> 04:23.430
HOPE: Kind of overkill
if you ask me.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.764
I told your dad

04:24.764 --> 04:27.225
that a unicorn barely counts
as a monster.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.062
LIZZIE:
Dearest father.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.647
Does this
dangerous monster

04:32.647 --> 04:35.442
happen to be a
magical pony?

04:35.442 --> 04:36.860
Maybe.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.488
Of all of the
manipulative

04:39.488 --> 04:41.615
ploys to...
(gasps)

04:41.615 --> 04:44.951
With all due respect,
I think that this

04:44.951 --> 04:46.286
is a matter for
the honor council.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.121
Well, then bring it up
at next month's meeting.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.831
Was actually thinking
of calling an emergency session.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.125
And I think I know
how we're gonna vote.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.213
(musical chime)
LIZZIE: Good news, friends.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.798
The talent show is going on
as previously scheduled.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.759
(students cheer, whistle)
(laughs)

05:00.759 --> 05:02.552
So, Lizzie's
acting weird.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.846
She's not the only one.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.598
Babe.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.058
We should do a talent.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.267
What?

05:09.267 --> 05:11.853
Uh, you and me?
I never wanted to before

05:11.853 --> 05:13.522
'cause I would have
had to do it alone.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.689
But now I have you.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.525
And we make up
our own faction.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.735
The tribrid and you.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.737
Yeah, all right, yeah.
Team Other.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.739
(chuckles)

05:27.619 --> 05:29.788
(Hope laughing)

05:29.788 --> 05:31.456
This is so much fun.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.458
I don't know why
we don't do this more often.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.127
(all laughing)

05:39.381 --> 05:42.217
Hey, do you know where
they moved the stupid canes

05:42.217 --> 05:43.260
for the talent show?

05:43.260 --> 05:45.053
Lizzie was asking me
to find them.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.347
You seem very anti-cane.
No.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.559
Uh, just anti-doing
the same exact thing every year.

05:50.559 --> 05:51.893
But it's fine.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.979
I'll keep an eye
out. But, um...

05:53.979 --> 05:56.356
I think someone has
an eye out for you.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.234
Oh, dear God, hide me.

05:59.234 --> 06:00.860
(Hope mumbles)

06:03.280 --> 06:04.197
Hi.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.789
Just make sure
you read it in private.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.416
I'm not gonna read it at all.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.966
Okay, what do you think
it says? "Check this box

06:22.966 --> 06:24.175
"if you want to kiss me,

06:24.175 --> 06:26.094
check this box if
you want to kill me"?

06:26.094 --> 06:29.055
I don't know
and I do not want to find out.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.266
If you need me to help you
smite the she-devil,

06:31.266 --> 06:32.601
I got you, girl.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.019
Okay.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.104
Did Emma just
slip you happy pills

06:36.104 --> 06:37.564
or something
while we were gone?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.316
No, just having a good day.

06:39.316 --> 06:40.567
That makes one of us.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.902
I got to get to class
but your day is gonna get

06:42.902 --> 06:44.446
so much better, Jo.
I just know it.

06:57.792 --> 07:01.588
Vampires, werewolves, dragons.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.132
I mean, I have faced...

07:04.132 --> 07:07.052
terrifying danger in my life.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.554
But there's only one day
in my calendar

07:09.554 --> 07:12.682
marked with a black "X."

07:12.682 --> 07:15.352
One day I...

07:15.352 --> 07:18.521
fear above all others.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.482
Because if I have to hear
somebody sing

07:20.482 --> 07:23.193
how many minutes there are
in a year...

07:23.193 --> 07:25.153
one more time...

07:25.153 --> 07:27.614
I'm gonna throw myself
to the unicorn.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.991
(Emma laughs)

07:29.991 --> 07:32.118
So why don't you
play hooky with me?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.245
(laughs)
What?

07:34.245 --> 07:36.414
The latest monster
is harmless,

07:36.414 --> 07:37.916
your daughters
are playing nice,

07:37.916 --> 07:39.167
and no one...

07:39.167 --> 07:41.002
is paying attention
to school.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.837
So give yourself
the day off.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.964
(unicorn whinnies)

07:45.882 --> 07:48.551
DORIAN: Look at you.
Eating hay.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.553
Acting all innocent.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.846
(nickers)

07:51.846 --> 07:53.598
You might have fooled
everybody else,

07:53.598 --> 07:55.392
but I got my eye
on you, okay?

07:55.392 --> 07:56.768
Yeah. That's right.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.687
(slug chittering)

07:58.687 --> 08:00.021
"It's a unicorn, Dorian.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.565
Don't hurt the unicorn."
Unicorn.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.275
LIZZIE:
And a five, six,

08:04.275 --> 08:05.777
seven, eight.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.696
(big band music playing)

08:07.696 --> 08:09.864
(indistinct chatter)

08:15.954 --> 08:19.332
(music stops)
Looks like we haven't been
practicing.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.293
And some of your outfits
must have shrunk. Or maybe

08:22.293 --> 08:24.838
there were just too many
late-night visits to the ca...

08:24.838 --> 08:26.840
(gasps)
But it's fine.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.383
We'll adjust.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.301
From the top. Josie?

08:31.386 --> 08:33.096
Where is Josie?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.603
(exhales) Oh.

08:40.603 --> 08:41.771
(gasps)

08:41.771 --> 08:43.189
Am I late?

08:43.189 --> 08:46.609
Where are the canes?

08:46.609 --> 08:48.820
I don't know.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.739
I actually went
to go find them, right?

08:50.739 --> 08:52.407
But then I was thinking,

08:52.407 --> 08:54.784
I don't feel like
stressing about it.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.453
Y-You didn't want...?

08:56.453 --> 08:58.663
Okay. That's fine.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.874
Why don't you just
take your usual place?

09:00.874 --> 09:02.625
Ah, about that.
I was actually thinking,

09:02.625 --> 09:05.253
I really don't feel like
being in the back row.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.922
Uh, well, I know you haven't
been practicing.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.299
But if you want

09:09.299 --> 09:11.092
to be in the front, you...
I mean, I just think

09:11.092 --> 09:12.886
we should scrap
that lame routine, right?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.804
Do something
totally different.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.806
It'd be super fun, right?

09:16.806 --> 09:18.183
And without the canes.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.560
It'd be fun.
(laughter)

09:20.560 --> 09:22.312
But, my beloved sister,

09:22.312 --> 09:25.023
this is the routine
we do every year.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.858
Because we win.
(slurps)

09:26.858 --> 09:29.402
Every year.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.405
I think I should
sing a new song.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.199
(forced laugh)

09:34.199 --> 09:36.201
And then everybody can
contribute some choreography,

09:36.201 --> 09:39.162
and it can be like a real...

09:39.162 --> 09:41.206
collaboration, hmm.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.333
Doesn't that just sound...

09:43.333 --> 09:45.877
(inhales sharply)
nice?

09:45.877 --> 09:49.172
Mm.
Hmm.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.349
RAFAEL:
Hey.
Hey.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.684
Thank you for coming.
Anything to avoid

10:01.684 --> 10:03.853
the wolves talking about
that stupid talent show.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.188
(both laugh)

10:05.188 --> 10:07.857
Apparently, deciding
what we do is a...

10:07.857 --> 10:09.275
alpha thing.
Hmm.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.527
Once you have
your gel mixed,

10:10.527 --> 10:12.612
make a shallow cut
on your volunteer.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.865
Do you trust me?

10:15.865 --> 10:17.784
Kind of.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.702
(both laugh)

10:24.499 --> 10:26.918
Thought this would be something
you'd want to do with Landon.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.962
If I mess up, you'll
heal on your own.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.005
Plus, you're a
little sturdier.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.469
So, what are you gonna do?

10:38.388 --> 10:39.597
Huh?

10:39.597 --> 10:40.849
For the talent show.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.017
Oh, um, one of the wolves
said he was gonna

10:43.017 --> 10:44.519
teach me to-to juggle.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.896
Juggle?

10:46.896 --> 10:50.149
Come on, you should
do something bold, spontaneous.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.235
Totally unexpected.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.865
Huh. Well done, Hope.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.449
Thank you,
Ms. Featherwood.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.078
See?

11:02.078 --> 11:04.247
Sorry to bolt,
but I gotta go figure

11:04.247 --> 11:05.957
what Landon and I are
good at together.

11:05.957 --> 11:08.042
Besides making out.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.713
Yeah, no problem.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.259
I can't believe I went from
having practically no one

11:16.259 --> 11:18.553
at this school to having
a boyfriend

11:18.553 --> 11:20.722
and a true friend
I know I can count on.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.311
I'm so lucky to have you both.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.322
(laughter)

11:46.164 --> 11:47.582
All right, y'all.
All right, hold on.

11:47.582 --> 11:50.001
I'm thinking maybe
we could compel people

11:50.001 --> 11:51.920
to do stupid human tricks.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.463
(all booing)

11:53.463 --> 11:55.340
Okay, all right.
Hold on.

11:55.340 --> 11:59.218
Is anyone up for
stand-up comedy? Huh?

11:59.218 --> 12:00.845
(all booing)
Yeah?

12:00.845 --> 12:02.472
No.
Okay. All right.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.557
Y'all don't want to do
anything fun.
(scoffs) Man,

12:04.557 --> 12:06.851
this whole thing is
a total waste of time.

12:06.851 --> 12:11.189
Well, I guess we could
just boycott the whole show.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.650
MG, we should be using this time
to take a stand.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.193
Right? I mean, come on.
(applause)

12:15.193 --> 12:16.527
Like, we-we should--
we should...

12:16.527 --> 12:20.365
Uh, we should--
we-we should sing.

12:21.532 --> 12:24.535

Okay, okay.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.379
All right, you,
get me a piano.

12:34.379 --> 12:35.713
MG, we're gonna need
a spotlight.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.173
Everyone else, line up.
I need to see

12:37.173 --> 12:38.633
how high you can kick.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.093
HOPE: If it's gooey,
then it's not done.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.511
Mm-mm.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.888
Are you sure cake decorating
counts as a talent?

12:43.888 --> 12:47.475
Well, um, you told me
that you don't know karate,

12:47.475 --> 12:49.352
then you stepped on my feet
during salsa,

12:49.352 --> 12:50.770
and then you straight up
refused to try

12:50.770 --> 12:52.605
synchronized ribbon dancing.
Sorry.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.191
My dignity wouldn't fit
in the unitard.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.776
(laughs)

12:56.776 --> 12:58.695
You know, it's not
too late to pull out

12:58.695 --> 13:00.238
that notebook of lyrics
that you have

13:00.238 --> 13:01.572
and sing something.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.783
I don't really sing
in front of people.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.994
Those songs are private.
Okay, well...

13:05.994 --> 13:07.578
cake decorating it is.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.748
And you know what?
You're gonna like it.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.458
(laughing):
Sorry.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.752
I like whatever's
gotten into you lately.

13:14.752 --> 13:15.920
Yeah?

13:17.255 --> 13:20.091
The only thing...

13:20.091 --> 13:21.634
that would make
this day better...

13:21.634 --> 13:23.261
Huh?

13:23.261 --> 13:25.763
...is if we went
and got rid of that urn.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.850
As the person that
stole the knife

13:28.850 --> 13:30.268
that started this
whole thing, trust me,

13:30.268 --> 13:31.602
that sounds like a bad idea.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.146
It'll be fun.
It'll be like a road trip.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.230
We'll just grab the damn thing

13:34.230 --> 13:35.481
and take it wherever
it leads us.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.691
From what that
Necromancer told you,

13:36.691 --> 13:37.942
Malivore is where
that leads us,

13:37.942 --> 13:39.694
and we have no idea
where that is.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.404
Are you feeling okay?
We can talk about it
on the road.

13:41.404 --> 13:42.530
I-- The cake.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.199
Oh...
(coughs)

13:47.744 --> 13:48.536
(coughing)

13:48.536 --> 13:50.705
Hope, turn on the vent.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.458
(gasps)

13:53.458 --> 13:55.960
Oh, my God!
Landon.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.963
What is that?

13:58.963 --> 13:59.922
(screeching)

14:01.382 --> 14:03.926
You ever see Wrath of Khan?

14:06.637 --> 14:08.556
(echoing whisper)

14:10.683 --> 14:12.060
Mr. Williams,
we need your help.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.394
Dr. Saltzman's been MIA,

14:13.394 --> 14:15.438
and this creepy slug
came out of my ear.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.779
Did it look like this?

14:22.779 --> 14:24.030
Yep, exactly like that.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.281
This one tried
getting into me.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.991
I was hoping it was
the only one.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.743
I think our harmless friend
the unicorn

14:28.743 --> 14:31.287
brought it onto school grounds
to infect all of us.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.247
(unicorn snorts)

14:33.247 --> 14:35.083
(neighing wildly)

And get dressed. Please.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.194
Hey.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.905
I thought you were
avoiding me.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.574
I was.
I mean, I am.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.953
You're not doing
a very good job.

17:16.953 --> 17:20.039
Maybe I'm sick of
always doing a good job.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.584
Do you want to get out of here?

17:27.213 --> 17:28.547
Okay, we have no idea how long

17:28.547 --> 17:30.716
the unicorn was infected
before it keeled over,

17:30.716 --> 17:32.218
so we should figure
this out right now.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.928
I thought only one monster
comes for the urn at a time.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.972
Except the unicorn
wasn't the monster.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.349
It was just the host
to this thing.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.725
A parasite.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.602
It hitched a ride here
in that Trojan horse,

17:41.602 --> 17:42.645
and then it moved on to us.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.188
From what Hope describes,

17:44.188 --> 17:46.732
it sounds like it latches onto
the prefrontal cortex,

17:46.732 --> 17:48.943
the part of the brain associated
with inhibitions.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.528
So, I was slug-drunk?

17:50.528 --> 17:52.530
Since we have multiple slugs,
it must

17:52.530 --> 17:54.907
replicate inside the host,
and then lie in wait

17:54.907 --> 17:57.076
for the opportunity
to infect someone else.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.078
I'm good on the gory details,
thank you.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.080
How do we stop it?
That's the weirdest part.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.958
I can't find any ancient legends
about a creature like this.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.503
Invasion of the Body Snatchers?

18:07.503 --> 18:10.381
The Faculty.
I say again, Wrath of Khan.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.216
Sci-fi is our modern-day myths.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.593
Meaning they could have been
inspired by something, right?

18:14.593 --> 18:17.013
In those movies,
it's all about mind control.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.389
Before the slug popped out,

18:18.389 --> 18:20.558
Hope wanted to take
the urn someplace.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.519
I'm guessing Malivore.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.939
So, it's like an infection.
It gets worse as it spreads.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.607
Stage one, it-it lowers
your inhibitions.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.109
It makes you act
out of character.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.612
Stage two, once you're
susceptible to suggestion,

18:33.612 --> 18:36.198
you'll do whatever
the slug wants.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.409
LANDON:
Till stage three.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.494
You go the way of the unicorn.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.748
Did you see this?

18:43.748 --> 18:45.750
Parts of this thing
look bioluminescent.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.627
Let me check that out.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.382
Whoa.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.967
See that?

19:01.849 --> 19:03.351
I don't want to know, do I?

19:03.351 --> 19:04.852
Probably not.
Nope. Nope.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.437
You know what?

19:06.437 --> 19:08.647
We can use these lights to find
anyone who's been infected.

19:12.568 --> 19:15.279
ALARIC: I think I liked
the last three bars

19:15.279 --> 19:16.572
better than this one.

19:19.367 --> 19:22.370

drinking establishment options.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.871
Indeed.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.874
Now, no more changing
the subject.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.543
Let's talk about you.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.380

"Truth or Shot."

This is why I hate sci-fi.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.180
(indistinct chatter)

21:49.642 --> 21:52.269
We need a way to de-slug
whosever infected, fast.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.855
When I touched the switch to
the kitchen vent, it shocked me,

21:54.855 --> 21:57.358
and that's when the
slug popped out.
Great. So we just have to find

21:57.358 --> 21:58.609
a way to electrocute every
student in the school

21:58.609 --> 22:00.236
without killing them.
If we don't,

22:00.236 --> 22:01.946
they're dead anyway.
I'm gonna call Ric.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.072
(sighs)

22:03.072 --> 22:05.491
(applause)

22:07.368 --> 22:09.036
My name is Rafael,

22:09.036 --> 22:11.539
and my talent
is spoken word poetry.

22:11.539 --> 22:12.957
(fingers snapping)

22:12.957 --> 22:13.999
LANDON: Oh, no.
He promised

22:13.999 --> 22:15.459
he wouldn't do this again.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.587
(snapping stops)

22:19.880 --> 22:22.258
(exhales)

22:22.258 --> 22:24.552
Stillness.

22:24.552 --> 22:28.347
A light breaks inside.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.350
Unity.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.645
And division. Tension.

22:34.645 --> 22:35.896
Suddenly, I remember
why I didn't want

22:35.896 --> 22:37.356
to be in the talent show.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.858
All these wolves staring at me,
waiting for the answer.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.986
Expectation is a cancer.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.655
Oh, you can't, sir?

22:44.655 --> 22:46.198
Then who will?

22:46.198 --> 22:48.158
(bass strumming)

22:51.495 --> 22:53.872
(strumming stops)

22:53.872 --> 22:55.916
Two brothers
brought up together.

22:55.916 --> 23:00.004
Then one's left behind
because he's no longer needed.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.839
Violence inside of me.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.842
Inside, I'm, I'm bleeding.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.344
What's he talking about?

23:07.344 --> 23:09.805
And I can't believe
what I'm feeling,

23:09.805 --> 23:13.517
since the moment
you danced with me.

23:13.517 --> 23:16.353
Buried so deep,

23:16.353 --> 23:18.814
rising up, enchanting me.

23:18.814 --> 23:22.151
And it won't go away.

23:24.987 --> 23:29.199
And I was never jealous
of anything that you had

23:29.199 --> 23:31.160
until today.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.085
And why is that artifact here?

23:40.085 --> 23:43.714
Monsters coming, people running.

23:43.714 --> 23:46.800
Ask for answers, always nothing.

23:53.724 --> 23:56.852
I say we get rid of it.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.735
So they're all infected? Okay.
Yeah, I'm not gonna
wait around to find out.

24:04.735 --> 24:07.279
(students shouting)

24:07.279 --> 24:08.364
Vessera portus.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.911
That should hold the pod people
in for now. Let's go.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.954

24:15.954 --> 24:18.082

25:15.472 --> 25:17.808
Don't trip!
Geez.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.478
Dorian. What's up?
(laughs)

25:21.478 --> 25:24.690
Ric, there's mind-control slugs
loose at the school

25:24.690 --> 25:26.150
making people act crazy.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.652
Electricity is the only way
to de-slug them,

25:28.652 --> 25:31.864
so we got to find a way
to shock everybody.
We're on our way.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.283
Mind-control slugs?

25:34.283 --> 25:36.410
We're totally infected,
aren't we?

25:36.410 --> 25:40.748
It would explain why we're
here, drinking on a school day.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.000
(both laugh)

25:45.294 --> 25:47.045
(moans)

25:47.045 --> 25:49.256
Does this mean
we have to shock ourselves?

25:49.256 --> 25:50.340
Yes.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.303
Or...

25:54.303 --> 25:56.305
we could just take off,
grab that ugly urn

25:56.305 --> 25:59.433
and, I don't know, throw it
in a river or something.

25:59.433 --> 26:01.143
We probably shouldn't
do anything drastic

26:01.143 --> 26:03.061
while we're infected.

26:03.061 --> 26:06.607
You are probably right.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.609
(chuckles):
Yeah.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.161
Just, uh, wanted to do that

26:19.161 --> 26:22.080
whilst we both
still had an excuse.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.666
We should find excuses
more often.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.168
Yeah.

26:30.464 --> 26:33.091
(moans)
You want to shock yourself?

26:33.091 --> 26:35.677
(groans)
(laughs)

26:35.677 --> 26:38.263
Okay.
Okay.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.598
(electricity crackling)

26:39.598 --> 26:41.016
Oh, my God.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.684
Whoa! Whoa!
Oh, my God!

26:42.684 --> 26:44.436
Don't let it go!

26:45.729 --> 26:47.397
That was gross.
(exhales)

26:47.397 --> 26:49.066
I guess it's my turn.
Yeah.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.403
(electricity crackling)

26:53.403 --> 26:55.113
(grunts)

27:03.205 --> 27:06.041
Well, that's... totally awkward.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.127
I sealed the doors
with a spell,

27:09.127 --> 27:10.546
but it won't hold forever.
All right.

27:10.546 --> 27:11.839
These chains should help
until we come up

27:11.839 --> 27:12.923
with a better solution.

27:12.923 --> 27:14.216
I'll get the doors downstairs.

27:15.509 --> 27:18.679
At least we have all the
infected people in one place.

27:18.679 --> 27:21.139
What are you two doing out here?

27:29.898 --> 27:31.692
Have you two gone crazy?

27:31.692 --> 27:33.610
You've been infected with
a mind-controlling parasite.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.153
That's why you've been
so nice all day.

27:35.153 --> 27:38.156
That is not
why I have been-- hey!

27:38.156 --> 27:39.408
I don't see any slug trails.

27:39.408 --> 27:42.494
What are you freaks
talking a-- ow.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.163
What was that?
Unchain me,

27:45.163 --> 27:48.417
and maybe I will tell you,
you thrift store hobbit.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.210
(gasps)

27:50.210 --> 27:51.503
I don't think she's infected.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.338
Then why are you acting
so weird?

27:53.338 --> 27:56.258
I'm not acting weird,
I am turning over a new leaf.

27:56.258 --> 27:59.386
With this--
I spelled it to zap me

27:59.386 --> 28:01.805
whenever I said anything mean.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.682
And in increasing voltage.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.517
Worst idea ever.
No.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.560
That's genius.

28:06.560 --> 28:07.769
That's why there's
no slug in her.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.062
She's been zapping herself.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.564
Then why are you wandering
around here,

28:10.564 --> 28:11.982
instead of at the talent show
like everyone else?

28:11.982 --> 28:13.317
I was looking for Josie.

28:13.317 --> 28:15.652
She's been acting weird all day

28:15.652 --> 28:17.404
and then she just bailed
on the performance.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.868
Probably because she's infected.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.370
We need to find her, now.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.305
Stop. Stop!

28:43.305 --> 28:45.557
You're all getting detention.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.935
ALARIC:
Dorian? Dorian!

28:47.935 --> 28:49.895
Stand back.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.730
Vessera portus.

28:56.193 --> 28:58.654
I'm so glad you're okay.

28:58.654 --> 29:00.322
I'm flattered.

29:04.910 --> 29:08.163
I may have found a solution
to our slug problem.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.377
(grunting):
Small spaces.

29:13.377 --> 29:16.171
(students shouting in distance)

29:18.465 --> 29:20.008
EMMA:
Aximander Dust.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.343
It was favored by the witches

29:21.343 --> 29:23.470
of the Roman Empire.

29:23.470 --> 29:26.139
It conducts electricity
through anything it touches.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.308
Think of it

29:28.308 --> 29:31.269
as chain lightning.

29:31.269 --> 29:34.690
All you need is a spark.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.776
Lecutio.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.739
(slugs shrieking)

29:56.003 --> 29:57.921
(grunts)

30:02.300 --> 30:04.720
So what was in that note
that you gave me?

30:06.638 --> 30:08.348
You were supposed to read it.

30:08.348 --> 30:09.891
You can't just
tell me what it says?

30:13.937 --> 30:15.355
That's what was in it.

30:19.818 --> 30:23.488
You know that we're never
getting back together, right?

30:26.700 --> 30:27.868
There.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.995
That's the urn.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.080
Let's go. You drive.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.541
Not so fast, Thelma and Louise.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.546
(echoing):
Icaeus.

30:39.546 --> 30:40.922
(shouts)

30:46.762 --> 30:47.679
Found the canes.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.847
You shouldn't have done that.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.227
Jo.

30:54.227 --> 30:56.021
Don't.
This isn't you.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.355
You don't even know the real me.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.024
Then answer one question
while you're saying

30:59.024 --> 31:00.233
how you really feel.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.069
Am I a good sister?

31:02.069 --> 31:03.320
Are you kidding me?

31:03.320 --> 31:05.238
You're a terrible sister.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.949
(electricity crackling)
(shouts)

31:11.995 --> 31:13.288
(slug screeching)

31:18.001 --> 31:19.920
(exhales)

31:22.089 --> 31:24.341
Lizzie...

31:24.341 --> 31:26.718
Lizzie, I'm so sorry.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.735
Hey. Wait up.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.654
Raf, um,

31:45.654 --> 31:47.531
we got some things
we need to talk about?

31:47.531 --> 31:50.408
(sighs) Dude, you know
I had that thing

31:50.408 --> 31:51.868
in me making me
act crazy.

31:51.868 --> 31:54.579
I don't even know
what I said.
(musical chime)

31:54.579 --> 31:56.039
ALARIC:
Attention, students.

31:56.039 --> 31:58.458
Given the incredibly odd
and distressing day

31:58.458 --> 31:59.960
we've all had,

31:59.960 --> 32:03.505
I'm thinking we could all use
a little pick-me-up,

32:03.505 --> 32:07.676
like a talent show redo.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.344
(applause)

32:09.344 --> 32:13.265
Uh, so, we're good?
Like, for real?

32:13.265 --> 32:16.476
Yeah. (chuckles) Always.
I'm happy for you.

32:16.476 --> 32:18.311
Thank you.
Thanks, man.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.689
Thank you.

32:20.689 --> 32:23.650
I'll see you.
All right.

32:33.493 --> 32:36.788
(circus music plays)

32:38.373 --> 32:40.584
(cheers and applause)

32:40.584 --> 32:43.086
ANNOUNCER: And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

32:43.086 --> 32:45.922
the vampire faction has chosen

32:45.922 --> 32:49.134
for their talent to do
a sit-in protest.

32:49.134 --> 32:52.512
(all booing)

32:52.512 --> 32:54.598
Okay, okay.

33:01.396 --> 33:05.984
All right, witches, grab a cane.
I've got some new choreography.

33:05.984 --> 33:09.070
Thank God. I can't believe
I actually wanted to sing.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.822
Oh, you're still singing.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.200
What?
Those slugs revealed

33:13.200 --> 33:15.076
your uninhibited self.

33:15.076 --> 33:17.162
You really want to share
the spotlight

33:17.162 --> 33:19.039
with the worst sister ever,

33:19.039 --> 33:20.540
Josie Saltzman?

33:20.540 --> 33:23.460
The spotlight
is officially yours.

33:25.378 --> 33:27.547

36:09.459 --> 36:12.962
Hi. So it took
three showers,

36:12.962 --> 36:14.589
but I think I'm finally clean.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.758
Three of 'em? Wow.
Three. Mm-hmm.

36:16.758 --> 36:18.760
Yeah, I don't have
slug envy or anything,

36:18.760 --> 36:20.678
but why do you think
I wasn't infected?

36:20.678 --> 36:22.013
I mean, it got
pretty much everybody,

36:22.013 --> 36:26.101
except Lizzie,
and she had the bracelet.

36:26.101 --> 36:28.853
Unless something's
just wrong with me.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.189
I don't, I don't know.
Oh, come on.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.732
Professional monster hunter
Hope Mikaelson

36:32.732 --> 36:34.067
doesn't even have a theory?

36:34.067 --> 36:36.569
I guess I'll add it to the list
of unexplainable things

36:36.569 --> 36:38.238
about Landon Kirby.

36:38.238 --> 36:39.656
(chuckles)

36:42.200 --> 36:44.202
I was being ridiculous all day.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.246
(both laugh)

36:46.246 --> 36:48.248
But I was happy.

36:48.248 --> 36:50.750
The things I said,
how I acted...

36:52.585 --> 36:56.381
Maybe it could be
that way all the time.

36:56.381 --> 36:57.674
Maybe the only thing

36:57.674 --> 37:00.343
that's keeping me
from being happy is me.

37:00.343 --> 37:03.596
You know, if life was about
being happy all the time,

37:03.596 --> 37:05.598
neither of us would've
survived this long.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.978
Which would be
a real shame...

37:09.978 --> 37:12.272
because then you
would never hear

37:12.272 --> 37:14.607
how bad I am at singing.

37:16.443 --> 37:17.944
Oh, boy.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.617
(laughs)

37:27.120 --> 37:29.122

LIZZIE:
I tortured myself

39:07.011 --> 39:08.763
trying so hard
to be nice,

39:08.763 --> 39:10.473
and all it got me
was a headache

39:10.473 --> 39:11.891
and everyone thinking
that I was infected.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.685
They just don't think
that I can change.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.771
Everyone just assumes
that I'm going to be a bitch.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.357
Maybe I should just be
what they want me to be.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.985
Well, that seems
reductive.
Does it though?

39:21.985 --> 39:23.528
We won, didn't we?

39:23.528 --> 39:25.780
The witches remain undefeated.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.907
So that is why
I have decided

39:27.907 --> 39:32.245
to permanently unleash
my inner bitch.

39:32.245 --> 39:33.913
Thank you, Daddy.

39:33.913 --> 39:36.249
This has been
the perfect talk.
Hmm.

39:44.549 --> 39:45.717
So...

39:45.717 --> 39:47.802
when I got
slugged today,

39:47.802 --> 39:51.306
do you think that
that's the real me?

39:51.306 --> 39:54.309
You know, some people think
that the real you

39:54.309 --> 39:56.811
comes out when your
inhibitions are lowered,

39:56.811 --> 39:59.480
but in my experience,

39:59.480 --> 40:04.569
sometimes what really defines
someone is what they won't do.

40:16.289 --> 40:19.584
(chuckling)

41:03.169 --> 41:04.837
EMMA (on recording):
You've reached Emma's phone.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.047
Leave a message.

41:06.047 --> 41:08.049
(beeps)
ALARIC: Emma, I just wanted

41:08.049 --> 41:10.927
to leave a message
and say I'm sorry.

41:10.927 --> 41:14.764
None of this would've happened
if it wasn't for that... slug

41:14.764 --> 41:16.599
mixing everything up.

41:18.434 --> 41:20.353
I hate that urn.

41:22.730 --> 41:24.565
So I'm just gonna get rid of it.
