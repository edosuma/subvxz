00:15.040 --> 00:17.680
<i>I think we all mean</i>
<i>something different by it.</i>

00:18.960 --> 00:20.480
<i>- Does it mean,</i>

00:20.560 --> 00:22.240
<i>to be free of sin?</i>

00:24.040 --> 00:28.320
<i>Does it mean, a</i>
<i>state of rightness</i>

00:28.400 --> 00:31.280
<i>given to us by the Holy Spirit?</i>

00:33.440 --> 00:35.600
<i>Azra Mckinven receives</i>
<i>this commendation today</i>

00:35.680 --> 00:38.600
<i>for her work in</i>
<i>intelligence analysis.</i>

00:38.680 --> 00:43.000
<i>Through digital profiling, she</i>
<i>identified nine individuals</i>

00:43.080 --> 00:45.440
<i>who she managed to</i>
<i>link to armed robberies</i>

00:45.520 --> 00:47.160
<i>throughout the force area.</i>

00:47.240 --> 00:51.600
<i>This resulted in nine</i>
<i>arrests and nine convictions.</i>

00:51.680 --> 00:52.720
<i>Congratulations.</i>

01:00.320 --> 01:02.920
<i>When you're instincts are right,</i>

01:03.000 --> 01:07.640
<i>you are doing the right</i>
<i>thing, saying the right thing,</i>

01:09.480 --> 01:14.240
<i>we try very hard to get</i>
<i>this sensation of rightness.</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:16.840
<i>Professor Sarah Gordon.</i>

01:22.800 --> 01:26.760
<i>- But maybe-</i>

01:28.440 --> 01:29.360
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:29.440 --> 01:34.040
<i>Welcome, come in, grab a chair.</i>

01:34.120 --> 01:36.160
<i>Professor Sarah Gordon</i>
<i>collaborated with us</i>

01:36.240 --> 01:38.960
<i>on a research project</i>
<i>into street drugs.</i>

01:39.040 --> 01:41.360
<i>Sarah's work as a forensic</i>
<i>chemist resulted in the</i>

01:41.440 --> 01:44.040
<i>shutting down of a</i>
<i>clandestine drugs laboratory,</i>

01:44.120 --> 01:45.720
<i>here in Dundee.</i>

01:45.800 --> 01:48.360
<i>The supply of lethal</i>
<i>drugs was stopped</i>

01:48.440 --> 01:52.240
<i>and lives were saved as</i>
<i>a result of Sarah's work.</i>

01:52.320 --> 01:53.240
<i>Thank you, Sarah.</i>

01:55.720 --> 01:57.520
<i>Thank you, sorry,</i>
<i>I just have to say</i>

01:57.600 --> 01:59.560
<i>it wasn't me on my</i>
<i>own, I work with a team</i>

01:59.640 --> 02:02.120
<i>and my lab assistant, Emma</i>
<i>Hedges, played a key role.</i>

02:02.200 --> 02:06.160
<i>- Thank you.</i>

02:06.240 --> 02:10.560
<i>But maybe, we just have</i>
<i>to open ourselves to it.</i>

02:10.640 --> 02:15.440
<i>Maybe, grace is out there</i>
<i>available to everyone.</i>

02:35.280 --> 02:36.440
<i>misunderstood - Nina Simone]</i>

03:21.520 --> 03:22.280
<i>Hiya.</i>

03:22.360 --> 03:23.280
<i>Emma.</i>

03:23.360 --> 03:24.080
<i>Have you seen Prof. Gordon?</i>

03:24.160 --> 03:25.040
<i>Not to talk to him, no.</i>

03:26.760 --> 03:28.560
<i>How are you feeling,</i>
<i>about the trial?</i>

03:29.880 --> 03:31.160
<i>It won't seem real</i>
<i>'til we start.</i>

03:31.240 --> 03:32.040
<i>Aye.</i>

03:33.080 --> 03:34.440
<i>I just wanna get it done.</i>

03:34.520 --> 03:35.760
<i>Get him locked up and</i>
<i>draw a line under it.</i>

03:35.840 --> 03:38.200
<i>Uh-huh, have you</i>
<i>had any training?</i>

03:38.280 --> 03:39.960
<i>No.</i>

03:40.040 --> 03:41.400
<i>You should talk to Kathy,</i>
<i>she's impressive in court.</i>

03:41.480 --> 03:43.400
<i>Most people really</i>
<i>feel the pressure.</i>

03:43.480 --> 03:45.040
<i>Is it really that bad?</i>

03:45.120 --> 03:46.360
<i>I've appeared as a witness</i>
<i>for the Crown many a times,</i>

03:46.440 --> 03:47.680
<i>I still don't sleep</i>
<i>the night before.</i>

03:48.960 --> 03:49.760
<i>Hey.</i>

03:49.840 --> 03:50.600
<i>Congratulations.</i>

03:50.680 --> 03:52.200
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:52.280 --> 03:53.280
<i>How've you been?</i>

03:53.360 --> 03:54.800
<i>Fine,</i>

03:54.880 --> 03:56.120
<i>you?</i>

03:56.200 --> 03:56.960
<i>Fine.</i>

03:58.200 --> 03:59.600
<i>Gimme my drink.</i>

04:02.080 --> 04:05.360
<i>Azra, this is Sarah</i>
<i>and Kathy and Emma.</i>

04:06.280 --> 04:08.320
<i>Hello, hi, hi.</i>

04:08.400 --> 04:09.400
<i>Congratulations.</i>

04:09.480 --> 04:11.120
<i>Oh, and you.</i>

04:11.200 --> 04:14.000
<i>That sounded so impressive,</i>
<i>your intelligence analysis.</i>

04:14.080 --> 04:16.320
<i>I don't think people</i>
<i>realise how important</i>

04:16.400 --> 04:19.360
<i>digital profiling is, well</i>
<i>interpreting all different kinds</i>

04:19.440 --> 04:20.960
<i>of data, really.</i>

04:21.040 --> 04:22.320
<i>And it's one thing to</i>
<i>spot something if you know</i>

04:22.400 --> 04:24.280
<i>what your looking for,</i>
<i>but usually you don't.</i>

04:28.360 --> 04:29.960
<i>Were you looking</i>
<i>at telephony data?</i>

04:30.040 --> 04:33.880
<i>Yes, and how did you</i>
<i>identify the drugs labs?</i>

04:36.320 --> 04:37.920
<i>Sorry, bad timing.</i>

04:43.480 --> 04:44.400
<i>She does.</i>

04:44.480 --> 04:45.720
<i>Nah-uh, she doesn't.</i>

04:45.800 --> 04:49.160
<i>She does, she fancies</i>
<i>the pants off you!</i>

04:49.240 --> 04:50.560
<i>Based on what?!</i>

04:50.640 --> 04:52.080
<i>- Neil, she was as red</i>

04:52.160 --> 04:53.080
<i>as a radish.</i>

04:53.160 --> 04:55.280
<i>Ahhh, she's a shy person.</i>

04:56.240 --> 04:57.600
<i>You're such a man.</i>

04:58.600 --> 05:00.200
<i>What does that mean?</i>

05:00.280 --> 05:01.840
<i>It means you're blind.</i>

05:01.920 --> 05:03.920
<i>I mean, women can read these</i>
<i>things from a mile off,</i>

05:04.000 --> 05:06.600
<i>but men, they've got no clue.</i>

05:06.680 --> 05:07.600
<i>Thank you.</i>

05:07.680 --> 05:09.240
<i>That's okay, I don't blame her,</i>

05:09.320 --> 05:10.560
<i>- Professor Gordon knows</i>

05:10.640 --> 05:11.680
<i>a good thing when she</i>
<i>sees it, she knows,</i>

05:11.760 --> 05:13.280
<i>Get off!</i>

05:13.360 --> 05:15.120
<i>- fun when she sees it!</i>

05:15.200 --> 05:16.480
<i>Azra!</i>

05:16.560 --> 05:18.120
<i>Oh.</i>

05:18.200 --> 05:19.400
<i>Shhh.</i>

05:19.480 --> 05:20.800
<i>What?</i>

05:20.880 --> 05:22.360
<i>Neil, I</i>
<i>need you in sharp.</i>

05:22.440 --> 05:24.560
<i>There's been an explosion</i>
<i>in the Newport area.</i>

05:24.640 --> 05:27.160
<i>They've ruled out gas, so</i>
<i>it's looking like a bomb.</i>

05:27.240 --> 05:29.080
<i>I want you as my deputy.</i>

05:33.920 --> 05:34.920
<i>You all right?</i>

05:35.000 --> 05:36.160
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:36.240 --> 05:37.000
<i>Did you get a mention?</i>

05:37.080 --> 05:37.880
<i>I did.</i>

05:40.760 --> 05:42.280
<i>Was it fun?</i>

05:42.360 --> 05:44.480
<i>Yeah, it was like a school</i>
<i>prize giving except-</i>

05:44.560 --> 05:46.280
<i>Everyone</i>
<i>was old and drunk.</i>

05:46.360 --> 05:48.800
<i>Oh, don't make me</i>
<i>laugh, I need a wee.</i>

05:48.880 --> 05:50.600
<i>I wish you'd seen</i>
<i>DCI McKinven's wife,</i>

05:50.680 --> 05:52.440
<i>she's like, wow!</i>

05:52.520 --> 05:54.000
<i>And then there was this funny...</i>

05:58.520 --> 05:59.280
<i>Are you okay?</i>

06:00.960 --> 06:03.160
<i>There's a confirmed date</i>
<i>for the trial, Wednesday.</i>

06:04.080 --> 06:04.880
<i>God.</i>

06:06.200 --> 06:08.520
<i>They're not calling</i>
<i>me as a witness.</i>

06:08.600 --> 06:09.360
<i>How come?</i>

06:12.200 --> 06:13.200
<i>One sec, I need a wee.</i>

06:17.760 --> 06:19.000
<i>It's good.</i>

06:19.080 --> 06:20.320
<i>It'll get us back</i>
<i>into the real world,</i>

06:20.400 --> 06:22.800
<i>because this is just</i>
<i>cloud cuckoo land.</i>

06:22.880 --> 06:23.680
<i>What is?</i>

06:25.320 --> 06:26.120
<i>This.</i>

06:29.280 --> 06:30.520
<i>You could come with me,</i>

06:30.600 --> 06:32.120
<i>have some training</i>
<i>with Prof. Torrance.</i>

06:33.480 --> 06:35.480
<i>I'm not scared of</i>
<i>being in court.</i>

06:35.560 --> 06:36.360
<i>Okay.</i>

06:38.520 --> 06:40.960
<i>But we are in this together.</i>

06:41.040 --> 06:41.840
<i>We are.</i>

06:47.040 --> 06:49.520
<i>I've been meaning to tell you,</i>

06:49.600 --> 06:50.880
<i>my periods late.</i>

06:56.560 --> 06:57.360
<i>Okay.</i>

06:58.360 --> 07:00.680
<i>Doesn't it freak you out?</i>

07:00.760 --> 07:01.520
<i>No.</i>

07:03.160 --> 07:04.880
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

07:04.960 --> 07:05.800
<i>Not at all.</i>

07:07.520 --> 07:08.320
<i>You?</i>

07:09.960 --> 07:12.320
<i>No, it doesn't freak me out.</i>

07:41.920 --> 07:43.440
<i>What kind of</i>
<i>bomb, do you reckon?</i>

07:43.520 --> 07:46.000
<i>Probably deflagrating</i>
<i>rather than detonating.</i>

07:46.080 --> 07:46.840
<i>Why?</i>

07:48.520 --> 07:50.840
<i>It looks like a wave of</i>
<i>energy pushed up and out.</i>

07:50.920 --> 07:51.680
<i>Good.</i>

08:00.240 --> 08:02.800
<i>"She takes days to</i>
<i>respond to emails."</i>

08:02.880 --> 08:05.760
<i>"It took her weeks to</i>
<i>mark one page of notes."</i>

08:05.840 --> 08:07.200
<i>"She's a harsh marker."</i>

08:08.880 --> 08:10.480
<i>"She's hard to get hold of and</i>
<i>when you do get hold of her,</i>

08:10.560 --> 08:11.720
<i>she can be a bitch."</i>

08:13.160 --> 08:15.760
<i>There's more in the</i>
<i>same vein, did you know?</i>

08:15.840 --> 08:19.360
<i>No, because why would I</i>
<i>go looking on Facebook</i>

08:19.440 --> 08:21.920
<i>to see what student communities</i>
<i>are saying about me?</i>

08:22.000 --> 08:23.640
<i>Well, I've been looking</i>
<i>in all sorts of places</i>

08:23.720 --> 08:26.280
<i>because I'm new,</i>
<i>and I need to learn.</i>

08:26.360 --> 08:29.240
<i>SIFA's clearly an exceptionally</i>
<i>successful department,</i>

08:29.320 --> 08:31.160
<i>that's why this</i>
<i>anomaly stood out.</i>

08:31.240 --> 08:33.480
<i>One of the reasons students</i>
<i>wanna study at SIFA</i>

08:33.560 --> 08:36.920
<i>is Sarah and I do casework,</i>
<i>that's a real draw.</i>

08:37.000 --> 08:39.400
<i>If I have to go to a crime</i>
<i>scene for a day or two,</i>

08:39.480 --> 08:41.840
<i>I will drop the ball,</i>
<i>but then I pick it up.</i>

08:41.920 --> 08:45.200
<i>I don't think I'm ever a</i>
<i>bitch, I just speak my mind.</i>

08:45.280 --> 08:48.120
<i>And I have great</i>
<i>rapport with students,</i>

08:48.200 --> 08:51.160
<i>but I have to say every</i>
<i>new cohort seems more needy</i>

08:51.240 --> 08:52.560
<i>than the last.</i>

08:52.640 --> 08:56.680
<i>Students first, that's</i>
<i>my credo, and growth.</i>

08:56.760 --> 08:57.680
<i>Right.</i>

08:57.760 --> 08:59.320
<i>So make any adjustments needed.</i>

09:00.440 --> 09:01.320
<i>Okay.</i>

09:01.400 --> 09:02.320
<i>One other thing.</i>

09:03.960 --> 09:06.200
<i>The animal welfare</i>
<i>society is worried about</i>

09:06.280 --> 09:08.040
<i>the treatment of the pigs.</i>

09:08.120 --> 09:09.200
<i>The pigs are dead.</i>

09:09.280 --> 09:10.920
<i>The students are worried.</i>

09:13.960 --> 09:18.760
<i>Okay, well, me and Erika</i>
<i>could maybe do a presentation</i>

09:18.840 --> 09:23.600
<i>and dispel any myths</i>
<i>about what we're doing?</i>

09:23.680 --> 09:24.440
<i>Erika?</i>

09:24.520 --> 09:25.800
<i>My PhD student.</i>

09:25.880 --> 09:27.760
<i>A presentation sounds great.</i>

09:27.840 --> 09:30.600
<i>Okay, let's have a follow-up</i>
<i>chat in a few weeks,</i>

09:30.680 --> 09:31.640
<i>see how you're doing.</i>

09:49.440 --> 09:50.600
<i>There could still</i>
<i>be toxic residue,</i>

09:50.680 --> 09:52.240
<i>so don't take any chances.</i>

10:39.640 --> 10:41.560
<i>I thought he'd be more damaged.</i>

10:41.640 --> 10:43.440
<i>The pressure wave from</i>
<i>the blast can kill you,</i>

10:43.520 --> 10:46.600
<i>it can disrupt internal organs.</i>

10:51.280 --> 10:53.800
<i>He entered the room</i>
<i>and a bomb went off.</i>

10:55.160 --> 10:56.400
<i>Who was he?</i>

10:56.480 --> 10:58.000
<i>His name was Joe Tinto.</i>

10:59.520 --> 11:03.280
<i>I said, "Joe, you're</i>
<i>not going to that talk?</i>

11:03.360 --> 11:04.640
<i>I thought you wanted to go."</i>

11:05.640 --> 11:07.360
<i>He'd lost track of the time.</i>

11:07.440 --> 11:10.520
<i>He was fixing his bike,</i>
<i>all bits on the drive.</i>

11:10.600 --> 11:14.680
<i>He said, "I can't go now,</i>
<i>I've not even had a shower,</i>

11:14.760 --> 11:15.560
<i>I'll be late."</i>

11:19.680 --> 11:23.400
<i>I said, "No one</i>
<i>will mind if ya are,</i>

11:23.480 --> 11:24.280
<i>go."</i>

11:26.440 --> 11:27.880
<i>The bomb wasn't on Joe Tinto,</i>

11:27.960 --> 11:29.200
<i>it was already in the room.</i>

11:30.320 --> 11:31.680
<i>Why might somebody target you?</i>

11:32.800 --> 11:34.680
<i>Because they think black priest</i>

11:34.760 --> 11:37.160
<i>should stay in black countries.</i>

11:37.240 --> 11:39.520
<i>Because of my views.</i>

11:39.600 --> 11:41.960
<i>I set up the East African</i>
<i>Catholic Brotherhood.</i>

11:43.800 --> 11:47.960
<i>I'm a campaigner for</i>
<i>the relaxation of</i>
<i>celibacy for priests,</i>

11:48.040 --> 11:50.760
<i>it's a divisive issue.</i>

11:50.840 --> 11:53.440
<i>Have you received</i>
<i>any threatening</i>
<i>messages in the past?</i>

11:55.600 --> 11:57.280
<i>There's a lot of</i>
<i>hate in the world.</i>

11:59.440 --> 12:00.160
<i>Let's see if</i>
<i>you paid attention</i>

12:00.240 --> 12:01.040
<i>at the strategy meeting.</i>

12:02.760 --> 12:04.600
<i>We move nothing</i>
<i>today, we sketch it out,</i>

12:04.680 --> 12:06.400
<i>flag any debris of interest.</i>

12:10.600 --> 12:12.400
<i>Measure the debris field,</i>

12:12.480 --> 12:15.360
<i>find the epicentre, which is</i>
<i>where there's the most damage.</i>

12:18.560 --> 12:20.360
<i>If you hate someone</i>
<i>for something they did,</i>

12:20.440 --> 12:22.040
<i>and you've got a gun in</i>
<i>your hand and your raging,</i>

12:22.120 --> 12:22.960
<i>I can get that.</i>

12:24.360 --> 12:28.120
<i>But to plan it and time</i>
<i>it and set it to happen,</i>

12:28.200 --> 12:29.040
<i>it's ice cold.</i>

12:30.040 --> 12:30.800
<i>Aye.</i>

12:32.400 --> 12:34.000
<i>Copper piping.</i>

12:34.080 --> 12:37.280
<i>Father Nkusi thinks it was</i>
<i>personal, a hate crime?</i>

12:37.360 --> 12:39.360
<i>Mm, mm.</i>

12:40.280 --> 12:41.640
<i>You don't?</i>

12:41.720 --> 12:43.120
<i>You should be led by</i>
<i>your recommended folk</i>

12:43.200 --> 12:45.440
<i>when they turn up, we're</i>
<i>just prepping for them.</i>

12:46.880 --> 12:47.880
<i>We won't quote you.</i>

12:50.480 --> 12:53.120
<i>If I was one of these online</i>
<i>abusers that Father Nkusi</i>

12:53.200 --> 12:55.120
<i>showed you, and I</i>
<i>wanted to kill him,</i>

12:56.440 --> 12:58.680
<i>I'd make a device to</i>
<i>target him specifically,</i>

13:00.040 --> 13:01.960
<i>a parcel bomb that goes</i>
<i>off when he opens it,</i>

13:02.040 --> 13:04.360
<i>a car bomb that goes off</i>
<i>when he starts his car,</i>

13:04.440 --> 13:06.840
<i>I wouldn't use a</i>
<i>pipe bomb like this.</i>

13:06.920 --> 13:08.920
<i>A pipe bomb targets</i>
<i>a group of people.</i>

13:09.000 --> 13:10.640
<i>That's what terrorists</i>
<i>use them for.</i>

13:11.680 --> 13:13.800
<i>But if I was targeting a group,</i>

13:13.880 --> 13:15.280
<i>I'd wanna harm as many</i>
<i>of them as possible,</i>

13:15.360 --> 13:16.880
<i>as badly as possible.</i>

13:16.960 --> 13:20.520
<i>I'd put shrapnel in my bomb,</i>
<i>nails and ball-bearings,</i>

13:20.600 --> 13:22.320
<i>so far I haven't seen any here.</i>

13:22.400 --> 13:23.760
<i>So, what are you thinking?</i>

13:26.960 --> 13:28.440
<i>This is really odd.</i>

13:30.440 --> 13:31.960
<i>What is in this?</i>

13:32.040 --> 13:33.560
<i>Beetroot.</i>

13:33.640 --> 13:35.160
<i>Janine, can you discourage</i>
<i>people from putting</i>

13:35.240 --> 13:36.600
<i>vegetables in cakes?</i>

13:36.680 --> 13:38.960
<i>No, the acceptance</i>
<i>of donated cakes</i>

13:39.040 --> 13:40.800
<i>has to be unconditional, surely.</i>

13:42.200 --> 13:43.280
<i>How was the do?</i>

13:43.360 --> 13:44.480
<i>Fine.</i>

13:44.560 --> 13:46.080
<i>We met DCI McKinven's wife,</i>

13:46.160 --> 13:48.520
<i>she's an unexpected hottie.</i>

13:48.600 --> 13:50.240
<i>In what way?</i>

13:50.320 --> 13:52.280
<i>Please don't make me spell</i>
<i>out the defining features</i>

13:52.360 --> 13:53.480
<i>of a hottie.</i>

13:53.560 --> 13:55.160
<i>It was the unexpected</i>
<i>bit I meant.</i>

13:55.240 --> 13:58.320
<i>Because he is Mr. Average.</i>

13:58.400 --> 13:59.120
<i>Right.</i>

14:00.680 --> 14:02.640
<i>Do I have a gap in my</i>
<i>day for Emma Hedges?</i>

14:02.720 --> 14:03.960
<i>How long do you need?</i>

14:04.040 --> 14:05.320
<i>Half an hour, she's</i>
<i>out with Sarah, right?</i>

14:05.400 --> 14:06.160
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

14:07.520 --> 14:10.320
<i>The talk on Twitter is</i>
<i>it was a racist attack,</i>

14:10.400 --> 14:12.280
<i>the priest giving the</i>
<i>talk was from Rwanda.</i>

14:12.360 --> 14:14.200
<i>Okay, well try to</i>
<i>remember that social media</i>

14:14.280 --> 14:16.400
<i>is just a bunch of</i>
<i>people getting off</i>
<i>on whipping things up</i>

14:16.480 --> 14:17.680
<i>and going unchecked.</i>

14:21.200 --> 14:23.000
<i>Will my dad be in</i>
<i>court throughout?</i>

14:23.080 --> 14:23.840
<i>Yes.</i>

14:25.000 --> 14:26.480
<i>Have you visited him?</i>

14:26.560 --> 14:27.360
<i>No.</i>

14:27.440 --> 14:28.520
<i>No contact at all?</i>

14:28.600 --> 14:29.440
<i>None.</i>

14:29.520 --> 14:30.280
<i>Good.</i>

14:32.040 --> 14:33.120
<i>Do you know how he is?</i>

14:34.080 --> 14:36.040
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

14:36.120 --> 14:37.400
<i>I just-</i>

14:37.480 --> 14:37.880
<i>]
Joseph] Are you</i>
<i>worried about him?</i>

14:37.960 --> 14:38.560
<i>Fuck no!</i>

14:40.640 --> 14:41.880
<i>Sorry.</i>

14:41.960 --> 14:43.400
<i>Are you worried</i>
<i>about seeing him?</i>

14:44.640 --> 14:46.400
<i>No, I'm just trying to be ready.</i>

14:46.480 --> 14:48.680
<i>You know I've had</i>
<i>months to stew on it.</i>

14:48.760 --> 14:50.200
<i>I don't wanna kill him anymore.</i>

14:51.880 --> 14:55.200
<i>It was kinda like I built a</i>
<i>wall and everything I used to</i>

14:55.280 --> 14:57.280
<i>feel about hims gone</i>
<i>behind the wall.</i>

14:57.360 --> 14:58.960
<i>Nobody wants to be a</i>
<i>prosecution witness</i>

14:59.040 --> 15:00.680
<i>against their dad.</i>

15:00.760 --> 15:02.280
<i>Will they call him as a witness?</i>

15:02.360 --> 15:04.040
<i>Your father has</i>
<i>the right to remain silent,</i>

15:04.120 --> 15:07.240
<i>but if they think it'll serve</i>
<i>them, they'll wheel him out.</i>

15:07.320 --> 15:09.480
<i>If they think he'll</i>
<i>damage their case,</i>

15:09.560 --> 15:11.040
<i>they'll keep him back.</i>

15:11.120 --> 15:12.360
<i>What would you do?</i>

15:12.440 --> 15:13.440
<i>I'd keep them back.</i>

15:14.360 --> 15:15.200
<i>Keep control.</i>

15:16.680 --> 15:18.280
<i>And they can't mention</i>
<i>the Nicole </i>

15:18.360 --> 15:20.680
<i>No, the thinking was no jury</i>
<i>could get their heads around</i>

15:20.760 --> 15:22.320
<i>two trials in one, so</i>
<i>the Fiscal pushed to get</i>

15:22.400 --> 15:24.440
<i>the murder trial</i>
<i>out the way first.</i>

15:25.960 --> 15:26.760
<i>Cool.</i>

15:27.960 --> 15:30.040
<i>We have a strong case, Daniel,</i>

15:30.120 --> 15:31.480
<i>is anything else on your mind?</i>

15:35.960 --> 15:37.480
<i>Just thinking on in the future.</i>

15:40.080 --> 15:42.240
<i>You know, with him</i>
<i>I'm just worried that</i>

15:42.320 --> 15:46.080
<i>this is gonna get personal</i>
<i>because of our relationship.</i>

15:46.160 --> 15:47.720
<i>Oh, it is.</i>

15:47.800 --> 15:51.760
<i>Your father's on trial for</i>
<i>murdering Emma's mother.</i>

15:51.840 --> 15:54.880
<i>It's going to get very</i>
<i>personal, because it is.</i>

15:59.160 --> 16:01.160
<i>A pipe bomb like this</i>
<i>will have had a round cap</i>

16:01.240 --> 16:04.600
<i>fitted to both ends, see</i>
<i>if you can spot the caps.</i>

16:09.960 --> 16:11.800
<i>Over here.</i>

17:15.360 --> 17:17.960
<i>Hi, this is Emma, leave</i>
<i>a message after the beep.</i>

17:19.200 --> 17:20.240
<i>Just ringing to hear your voice,</i>

17:20.320 --> 17:22.480
<i>I'll see you later, all right?</i>

17:22.560 --> 17:23.800
<i>Bye my darlin'.</i>

17:29.720 --> 17:30.680
<i>What are you doing?</i>

17:32.080 --> 17:33.640
<i>- I'm just-</i>
<i>- I've told you before pal,</i>

17:33.720 --> 17:36.280
<i>if you're not visiting,</i>
<i>you can't hang about here.</i>

17:40.000 --> 17:41.720
<i>A Crown case is like a wall,</i>

17:41.800 --> 17:42.560
<i>you know this one?</i>

17:42.640 --> 17:43.960
<i>No.</i>

17:44.040 --> 17:45.400
<i>The defence pulls</i>
<i>a brick away here</i>

17:45.480 --> 17:47.120
<i>and a brick away</i>
<i>there in the hope that</i>

17:47.200 --> 17:48.920
<i>eventually the wall collapses.</i>

17:49.000 --> 17:50.400
<i>We're the bricks.</i>

17:50.480 --> 17:51.520
<i>So what do we do?</i>

17:51.600 --> 17:53.320
<i>Whatever makes you feel calm.</i>

17:53.400 --> 17:55.040
<i>I know the first thing</i>
<i>they're gonna go for is</i>

17:55.120 --> 17:57.400
<i>my methodology and</i>
<i>then the science.</i>

17:57.480 --> 17:59.240
<i>And if all that fails,</i>
<i>they'll go for me personally.</i>

17:59.320 --> 18:02.000
<i>So, I take off my shoes.</i>

18:03.520 --> 18:04.840
<i>Seriously?</i>

18:04.920 --> 18:06.200
<i>You're in the witness</i>
<i>stand, no one can see,</i>

18:06.280 --> 18:07.920
<i>it grounds me.</i>

18:08.000 --> 18:10.240
<i>I focus on the jury because</i>
<i>that's who I need to reach.</i>

18:10.320 --> 18:13.400
<i>I don't look at the accused, I</i>
<i>don't wanna engage with them.</i>

18:16.320 --> 18:19.080
<i>Is there something</i>
<i>particular that worries you?</i>

18:19.160 --> 18:21.600
<i>I hate Phil MacAfee so much,</i>

18:21.680 --> 18:23.640
<i>I'm scared that when</i>
<i>I see him in the dock</i>

18:23.720 --> 18:26.320
<i>I'm gonna start crying</i>
<i>or shouting or something</i>

18:26.400 --> 18:29.360
<i>and people will think I'm</i>
<i>mad and won't listen to me.</i>

18:29.440 --> 18:31.320
<i>I don't want to avoid</i>
<i>looking at him because</i>

18:31.400 --> 18:34.640
<i>I don't want him to have</i>
<i>that power over me, but I...</i>

18:34.720 --> 18:36.840
<i>You don't wanna lose control?</i>

18:36.920 --> 18:38.120
<i>I don't wanna lose control.</i>

18:38.200 --> 18:39.360
<i>You won't.</i>

18:39.440 --> 18:41.160
<i>Just decide you won't.</i>

18:41.240 --> 18:43.400
<i>You stay as calm as you</i>
<i>can and really listen.</i>

18:43.480 --> 18:44.920
<i>Take your time.</i>

18:45.000 --> 18:46.120
<i>Stick to your facts.</i>

18:46.200 --> 18:47.600
<i>Don't take the bait.</i>

18:47.680 --> 18:48.680
<i>Okay.</i>

18:48.760 --> 18:50.320
<i>It's all up here.</i>

18:50.400 --> 18:53.160
<i>It's about mental strength,</i>
<i>which you have in spades,</i>

18:53.240 --> 18:54.000
<i>you'll be fine.</i>

19:17.480 --> 19:19.200
<i>Thanks for covering today.</i>

19:19.280 --> 19:20.800
<i>Sure.</i>

19:20.880 --> 19:22.360
<i>Could you make sure that</i>
<i>pathologist scans the body for</i>

19:22.440 --> 19:24.080
<i>embedded fragments?</i>

19:24.160 --> 19:24.960
<i>Okay.</i>

19:26.920 --> 19:29.360
<i>Neil, I've got question</i>
<i>mark about the timer.</i>

19:29.440 --> 19:32.320
<i>It's possible it went</i>
<i>off later than planned.</i>

19:32.400 --> 19:33.440
<i>How come?</i>

19:35.600 --> 19:36.480
<i>I'll ring you tonight.</i>

19:36.560 --> 19:38.000
<i>No!</i>

19:38.080 --> 19:39.080
<i>Oh?</i>

19:39.160 --> 19:41.080
<i>Ahhh, I'm sorry,</i>
<i>that came out...</i>

19:43.080 --> 19:46.560
<i>I just mean in general,</i>
<i>please don't ring me at home.</i>

19:46.640 --> 19:48.200
<i>I don't, I ring your mobile.</i>

19:48.280 --> 19:50.480
<i>When I'm at home, please</i>
<i>don't ring me at night</i>

19:50.560 --> 19:52.080
<i>when I'm at home, if possible.</i>

19:53.480 --> 19:55.680
<i>Why?</i>

19:55.760 --> 19:58.360
<i>Let's just say I'm under</i>
<i>pressure to improve</i>

19:58.440 --> 19:59.720
<i>my work-life balance.</i>

20:02.400 --> 20:03.600
<i>Right.</i>

20:03.680 --> 20:04.720
<i>I'm sorry to ask.</i>

20:06.040 --> 20:07.560
<i>Come on, let's find</i>
<i>somewhere quiet.</i>

20:13.880 --> 20:15.920
<i>I can just email my notes over,</i>

20:16.000 --> 20:17.680
<i>if you prefer, then</i>
<i>we're done and dusted.</i>

20:17.760 --> 20:19.000
<i>No, this is important.</i>

20:19.080 --> 20:19.960
<i>Professor Gordon!</i>

20:21.600 --> 20:22.360
<i>Afternoon, Neil.</i>

20:23.880 --> 20:26.040
<i>I told the folk at the</i>
<i>National Crime Agency,</i>

20:26.120 --> 20:28.760
<i>you are tiding us over 'til</i>
<i>we got their recommendation.</i>

20:28.840 --> 20:31.200
<i>And they said, "What</i>
<i>you talking about?</i>

20:31.280 --> 20:33.560
<i>Sarah Gordon is</i>
<i>the recommendation,</i>

20:33.640 --> 20:35.600
<i>she's got every</i>
<i>accreditation under the sun."</i>

20:35.680 --> 20:37.320
<i>Why didn't you say?</i>

20:37.400 --> 20:39.720
<i>Well, I can't recommend</i>
<i>myself, can I?</i>

20:39.800 --> 20:41.600
<i>Please forgive me</i>
<i>for not knowing</i>

20:41.680 --> 20:43.680
<i>we had all this expertise</i>
<i>on our doorstep.</i>

20:45.400 --> 20:47.040
<i>We'll be needing you on board</i>
<i>for the duration of the case.</i>

20:47.120 --> 20:49.680
<i>Good, if you wanna see</i>
<i>the high security lab,</i>

20:49.760 --> 20:51.320
<i>you can just drop by any time.</i>

20:51.400 --> 20:53.120
<i>I take it you have</i>
<i>security clearance?</i>

20:54.800 --> 20:56.840
<i>I'm the Procurator Fiscal,</i>
<i>I have so much clearance</i>

20:56.920 --> 20:58.080
<i>I have to keep it</i>
<i>in a special room.</i>

20:59.000 --> 20:59.760
<i>Bye.</i>

21:04.960 --> 21:07.480
<i>I think it's personal, you'd</i>
<i>expect a political group</i>

21:07.560 --> 21:09.040
<i>to come forward.</i>

21:09.120 --> 21:10.480
<i>Not if they made an arse of it.</i>

21:10.560 --> 21:12.280
<i>They killed one</i>
<i>guy, the wrong guy.</i>

21:12.360 --> 21:14.000
<i>Well, on the news</i>
<i>it said it could be</i>

21:14.080 --> 21:15.640
<i>an anti-Catholic thing.</i>

21:17.280 --> 21:18.600
<i>Well, why didn't they</i>
<i>just blow up a church then</i>

21:18.680 --> 21:19.960
<i>with a lot of people in it?</i>

21:22.280 --> 21:24.240
<i>We're looking at an angle,</i>
<i>different angle, but,</i>

21:24.320 --> 21:25.320
<i>it's too early to say.</i>

21:26.680 --> 21:30.760
<i>And how is, how's</i>
<i>Professor Cutie Pie?</i>

21:30.840 --> 21:32.480
<i>Fine.</i>

21:32.560 --> 21:34.720
<i>How long does she have the</i>
<i>thrill of working with you?</i>

21:36.360 --> 21:37.920
<i>I dunno, a few days I imagine.</i>

21:38.000 --> 21:39.840
<i>- Well, don't wear the</i>

21:39.920 --> 21:41.760
<i>blue shirt that</i>
<i>makes your eyes pop,</i>

21:41.840 --> 21:43.000
<i>she'll be beside herself.</i>

21:48.920 --> 21:50.080
<i>- Evening.</i>
<i>- Here you go.</i>

21:50.160 --> 21:50.600
<i>Thanks,</i>
<i>enjoy your meal.</i>

21:50.680 --> 21:51.400
<i>Thanks.</i>

21:55.360 --> 21:58.440
<i>This</i>
<i>calm, restful place,</i>

21:58.520 --> 22:01.120
<i>breathing steadily all the while</i>

22:01.200 --> 22:05.480
<i>and feel yourself move deeper</i>
<i>still into controlled calm-</i>

22:06.480 --> 22:07.600
<i>What you listening to?</i>

22:08.880 --> 22:10.160
<i>Music.</i>

22:10.240 --> 22:11.400
<i>What have you done today?</i>

22:12.400 --> 22:13.840
<i>Nothing much.</i>

22:13.920 --> 22:15.520
<i>Do you want to see</i>
<i>what I did today?</i>

22:19.000 --> 22:21.720
<i>It's an early test,</i>
<i>it's only really faint,</i>

22:21.800 --> 22:24.640
<i>but it says even</i>
<i>faint is positive.</i>

22:24.720 --> 22:26.160
<i>You are?</i>

22:26.240 --> 22:27.000
<i>I am.</i>

22:30.400 --> 22:32.320
<i>Emma, what you thinking?</i>

22:32.400 --> 22:35.080
<i>Well, it's really early,</i>
<i>so who knows? But,</i>

22:35.160 --> 22:36.720
<i>it's what we've</i>
<i>always talked about,</i>

22:36.800 --> 22:39.240
<i>just possibly a hell</i>
<i>of a lot sooner.</i>

22:41.240 --> 22:42.360
<i>How do you feel about it?</i>

22:44.520 --> 22:45.640
<i>I'm delighted with it.</i>

22:51.280 --> 22:52.320
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

23:02.080 --> 23:04.520
<i>Now, lets get this</i>
<i>trial out the way,</i>

23:04.600 --> 23:07.400
<i>find a place to live and</i>
<i>have ourselves a baby.</i>

23:41.120 --> 23:44.240
<i>Sarah thinks the bomb timer</i>
<i>went off later than planned.</i>

23:44.320 --> 23:46.920
<i>The class before the</i>
<i>Bible study is Pilates,</i>

23:47.000 --> 23:49.240
<i>runs between half past</i>
<i>five and half past six.</i>

23:49.320 --> 23:51.280
<i>We spoke to the teacher, she's</i>
<i>making a list of the people</i>

23:51.360 --> 23:53.040
<i>who routinely attend the class.</i>

23:53.120 --> 23:54.760
<i>She always takes the</i>
<i>class from the raised end</i>

23:54.840 --> 23:56.400
<i>of the hall.</i>

23:56.480 --> 23:57.960
<i>Anybody looking through</i>
<i>the window would be able to</i>

23:58.040 --> 23:59.040
<i>ascertain that, they'd</i>
<i>know where to plant a bomb.</i>

23:59.120 --> 24:00.640
<i>What's the security like?</i>

24:00.720 --> 24:02.400
<i>Once the hall opens</i>
<i>for the first session,</i>

24:02.480 --> 24:05.000
<i>it stays open 'til the</i>
<i>last session is locked up,</i>

24:05.080 --> 24:07.800
<i>folk are free to walk</i>
<i>in and out, and they do.</i>

24:07.880 --> 24:09.080
<i>There's no CCTV.</i>

24:11.000 --> 24:13.520
<i>The anti-terrorist unit is</i>
<i>watching and waiting to see</i>

24:13.600 --> 24:14.720
<i>if this is one for them.</i>

24:16.320 --> 24:17.480
<i>Chase Sarah Gordon.</i>

25:16.680 --> 25:18.200
<i>We can make a fun presentation.</i>

25:19.600 --> 25:20.520
<i>You want me to come</i>
<i>up with some ideas?</i>

25:20.600 --> 25:21.920
<i>Yeah, that'd be great.</i>

25:22.000 --> 25:22.800
<i>No problem.</i>

25:31.120 --> 25:33.320
<i>Erika, you've spent a lot</i>
<i>of time with first years,</i>

25:33.400 --> 25:34.360
<i>do you...ahhh.</i>

25:38.000 --> 25:42.160
<i>I've been told some of</i>
<i>them are, dissatisfied.</i>

25:44.120 --> 25:44.880
<i>With you?</i>

25:48.400 --> 25:51.680
<i>Yes, I do hear that sometimes.</i>

25:53.240 --> 25:54.800
<i>Right.</i>

25:54.880 --> 25:57.320
<i>My God! Students drive me crazy.</i>

25:57.400 --> 25:59.960
<i>When I do the demonstration,</i>
<i>they never read the atlas,</i>

26:00.040 --> 26:02.200
<i>they don't listen, they</i>
<i>complain about everything.</i>

26:02.280 --> 26:05.040
<i>They want their mommies,</i>
<i>they want their asses wiped.</i>

26:05.120 --> 26:06.640
<i>They should be</i>
<i>proud to have you.</i>

26:12.200 --> 26:13.880
<i>Do you want me to</i>
<i>tell you who it is?</i>

26:17.120 --> 26:18.640
<i>These are the component parts,</i>

26:18.720 --> 26:22.720
<i>timer, initiator,</i>
<i>detonator, main charge.</i>

26:22.800 --> 26:24.600
<i>The chemical residue</i>
<i>from inside the pipe</i>

26:24.680 --> 26:26.200
<i>is being analysed and</i>
<i>we'll know tomorrow</i>

26:26.280 --> 26:28.360
<i>what the explosive material was.</i>

26:28.440 --> 26:30.640
<i>These are the parts of the</i>
<i>nine volt battery used.</i>

26:30.720 --> 26:33.040
<i>Emma managed to find</i>
<i>all six cylinders.</i>

26:33.120 --> 26:34.800
<i>Now, the timer.</i>

26:34.880 --> 26:36.960
<i>I must admit, I</i>
<i>can't picture it.</i>

26:37.040 --> 26:38.520
<i>Oh, don't worry,</i>
<i>I've made a bomb.</i>

26:39.920 --> 26:41.960
<i>The alarm is set to go</i>
<i>off at a certain time</i>

26:42.040 --> 26:44.160
<i>and it's rigged so that</i>
<i>when that time is reached</i>

26:44.240 --> 26:45.880
<i>it completes an</i>
<i>electrical circuit.</i>

26:45.960 --> 26:48.840
<i>Two wires to this battery,</i>
<i>that electrical shock</i>

26:48.920 --> 26:49.720
<i>sets off the bomb.</i>

26:52.240 --> 26:54.840
<i>The hands blown off, now</i>
<i>that could be showing</i>

26:54.920 --> 26:56.000
<i>five to six or-</i>

26:56.080 --> 26:57.360
<i>25 past 12.</i>

26:57.440 --> 26:59.320
<i>Yeah, if they were</i>
<i>still moveable,</i>

26:59.400 --> 27:01.880
<i>they'd be no use as a guide to</i>
<i>the timing, but they're not.</i>

27:01.960 --> 27:04.440
<i>They're fused by heat at</i>
<i>the moment of the explosion,</i>

27:04.520 --> 27:06.400
<i>there's smoke shadowing</i>
<i>and tiny bits of plastic</i>

27:06.480 --> 27:07.480
<i>from the hands.</i>

27:07.560 --> 27:09.720
<i>It was set for five to six.</i>

27:09.800 --> 27:11.240
<i>It went off at five to seven.</i>

27:12.520 --> 27:13.280
<i>Exactly.</i>

27:17.880 --> 27:19.080
<i>The clocks went forward.</i>

27:20.800 --> 27:23.280
<i>The bomber didn't</i>
<i>change the time.</i>

27:23.360 --> 27:24.400
<i>What a mistake to make.</i>

27:24.480 --> 27:26.080
<i>It's amateur.</i>

27:26.160 --> 27:28.920
<i>So if we're saying that the</i>
<i>target was the Pilates class,</i>

27:29.000 --> 27:30.360
<i>makes me think it's personal.</i>

27:30.440 --> 27:31.840
<i>This is the epicentre.</i>

27:33.560 --> 27:36.400
<i>It seems the bomb was in a</i>
<i>box, inside a sports bag,</i>

27:36.480 --> 27:38.320
<i>stored in the cubby holes.</i>

27:38.400 --> 27:39.720
<i>That's our next task.</i>

27:39.800 --> 27:41.800
<i>We'll check those</i>
<i>for fingerprints.</i>

27:41.880 --> 27:43.520
<i>Whoever set the device</i>
<i>could have put it there</i>

27:43.600 --> 27:45.320
<i>anytime after five to</i>
<i>six in the morning.</i>

27:45.400 --> 27:46.720
<i>The hall opens at</i>
<i>12 on a Sunday,</i>

27:46.800 --> 27:48.120
<i>so they had a six hour window.</i>

27:48.200 --> 27:49.800
<i>This is an impressive setup.</i>

27:49.880 --> 27:51.760
<i>I'm happy for you to</i>
<i>undertake analytical work</i>

27:51.840 --> 27:52.600
<i>here as needed.</i>

27:53.600 --> 27:54.360
<i>Thank you.</i>

27:56.600 --> 27:57.880
<i>And everyone was thinking,</i>

27:57.960 --> 27:59.520
<i>"This is about this</i>
<i>priest from Rwanda,</i>

27:59.600 --> 28:01.480
<i>someone's got it in for him</i>
<i>and they've set this bomb</i>

28:01.560 --> 28:03.320
<i>to go off in the</i>
<i>middle of his talk."</i>

28:03.400 --> 28:05.280
<i>And now it's looking like</i>
<i>it may be nothing to do</i>

28:05.360 --> 28:06.720
<i>with that whatsoever.</i>

28:06.800 --> 28:08.400
<i>Well, this is what happens.</i>

28:08.480 --> 28:09.520
<i>Eh?</i>

28:09.600 --> 28:10.880
<i>Well, it happens all the time,</i>

28:10.960 --> 28:12.560
<i>I mean, you see on every</i>
<i>documentary on Netflix,</i>

28:12.640 --> 28:14.360
<i>people banged up for years</i>
<i>for things they didn't do</i>

28:14.440 --> 28:15.840
<i>because the experts</i>
<i>thought they knew</i>

28:15.920 --> 28:17.120
<i>and didn't look</i>
<i>at anything else.</i>

28:17.200 --> 28:18.800
<i>Yeah, but we did look</i>
<i>at something else.</i>

28:18.880 --> 28:20.560
<i>Prof. Gordon worked</i>
<i>out from the evidence</i>

28:20.640 --> 28:22.440
<i>that it wasn't what</i>
<i>people thought they knew.</i>

28:22.520 --> 28:24.640
<i>Miscarriages of justice</i>
<i>happen all the time.</i>

28:26.320 --> 28:28.920
<i>Yeah and men kill women and</i>
<i>get away with it all the time.</i>

28:33.880 --> 28:35.240
<i>Look, you know what I think,</i>

28:37.240 --> 28:39.760
<i>the fact is it was 19 years</i>
<i>ago, none of us were there,</i>

28:39.840 --> 28:40.720
<i>none of us know what happened,</i>

28:40.800 --> 28:41.800
<i>that's why we're having a trial.</i>

28:41.880 --> 28:43.560
<i>Why do you keep defending him?</i>

28:43.640 --> 28:45.520
<i>Because you want him to</i>
<i>be a murderer and I don't.</i>

28:45.600 --> 28:47.680
<i>I don't want him to be one,</i>
<i>I just think he is one.</i>

28:50.440 --> 28:51.840
<i>We need to be kind.</i>

28:51.920 --> 28:53.120
<i>Tomorrow's a big day.</i>

28:55.960 --> 28:59.480
<i>DCI McKinven says he still</i>
<i>doesn't sleep the night before.</i>

28:59.560 --> 29:01.560
<i>What's the point of</i>
<i>telling you that?</i>

29:01.640 --> 29:03.440
<i>I think it came</i>
<i>from a good place,</i>

29:03.520 --> 29:05.920
<i>people are trying to prepare us.</i>

29:06.000 --> 29:07.520
<i>It's the lawyers who</i>
<i>need to be prepared</i>

29:07.600 --> 29:09.120
<i>and they are.</i>

29:09.200 --> 29:10.480
<i>People shouldn't put</i>
<i>pressure on you to prepare</i>

29:10.560 --> 29:12.280
<i>for something you</i>
<i>can't prepare for.</i>

29:12.360 --> 29:14.920
<i>No one on earth knows what's</i>
<i>gonna happen in that court.</i>

29:16.160 --> 29:17.440
<i>Anyone want tea?</i>

29:17.520 --> 29:19.760
<i>No thanks, I said</i>
<i>I'd ring Julie.</i>

29:19.840 --> 29:20.640
<i>Okay sweetheart.</i>

29:28.360 --> 29:31.320
<i>Do you remember when we</i>
<i>took the caravan to Skye?</i>

29:31.400 --> 29:32.160
<i>I do.</i>

29:37.240 --> 29:38.120
<i>I keep thinking about</i>
<i>times when we were-</i>

29:38.200 --> 29:39.200
<i>The happy family?</i>

29:42.000 --> 29:42.760
<i>Me too.</i>

29:47.800 --> 29:49.920
<i>I was thinking this morning</i>
<i>about the day you were born,</i>

29:50.000 --> 29:52.240
<i>you know, you came</i>
<i>on fast, really fast.</i>

29:52.320 --> 29:53.560
<i>Aye.</i>

29:53.640 --> 29:56.560
<i>Your father was fantastic, kind.</i>

29:58.000 --> 29:59.360
<i>I don't know how we got here.</i>

30:01.080 --> 30:05.080
<i>I know he was a</i>
<i>philanderer, but... murder?</i>

30:11.480 --> 30:13.640
<i>I don't want to be the guy</i>
<i>who gets his father put away.</i>

30:15.800 --> 30:17.480
<i>Look, all you do is</i>
<i>you go into that court</i>

30:17.560 --> 30:19.600
<i>and you tell the truth about</i>
<i>your wee piece of the puzzle,</i>

30:19.680 --> 30:21.720
<i>that's all, because that's</i>
<i>all you have one wee piece,</i>

30:21.800 --> 30:23.440
<i>that's it.</i>

30:23.520 --> 30:25.080
<i>You don't put him away or</i>
<i>not, the judge or jury do.</i>

30:32.960 --> 30:34.240
<i>Emma might be pregnant.</i>

30:37.880 --> 30:39.040
<i>I hope to God she's not.</i>

30:39.120 --> 30:39.880
<i>Jesus!</i>

30:39.960 --> 30:41.320
<i>Jesus yourself, think!</i>

30:43.000 --> 30:45.120
<i>What would you say to that</i>
<i>child when they want to know</i>

30:45.200 --> 30:47.280
<i>about their granny</i>
<i>or their granddad?</i>

30:49.640 --> 30:51.240
<i>You must not have a</i>
<i>baby with that girl,</i>

30:51.320 --> 30:52.560
<i>you shouldn't even</i>
<i>be with that girl.</i>

30:52.640 --> 30:54.400
<i>No good can come of it ever.</i>

31:15.560 --> 31:16.480
<i>What time do</i>
<i>they want you in court?</i>

31:16.560 --> 31:17.360
<i>After lunch.</i>

31:19.000 --> 31:20.160
<i>Do you think Emma will be okay?</i>

31:20.240 --> 31:22.280
<i>Who knows? I hope so.</i>

31:23.200 --> 31:24.800
<i>Me too.</i>

31:24.880 --> 31:26.880
<i>What's the Dean even doing</i>
<i>sniffing around on Facebook,</i>

31:26.960 --> 31:28.480
<i>looking for student comments?</i>

31:28.560 --> 31:29.880
<i>That's not her job.</i>

31:29.960 --> 31:31.200
<i>Maybe she's marking</i>
<i>her territory,</i>

31:31.280 --> 31:32.480
<i>maybe she feels insecure.</i>

31:32.560 --> 31:34.440
<i>Just let her settle in.</i>

31:34.520 --> 31:35.840
<i>Ambushing me in my office!</i>

31:35.920 --> 31:37.200
<i>Why is she on my case?</i>

31:37.280 --> 31:39.320
<i>I think she may be on</i>
<i>mine, she's fixated on</i>

31:39.400 --> 31:40.920
<i>this new undergraduate course.</i>

31:41.000 --> 31:41.880
<i>Has she asked you about it?</i>

31:41.960 --> 31:42.880
<i>No.</i>

31:42.960 --> 31:44.920
<i>Oh good, maybe she's moved on.</i>

31:45.000 --> 31:46.400
<i>Anyway, I know who they are.</i>

31:46.480 --> 31:48.040
<i>Who who are?</i>

31:48.120 --> 31:50.480
<i>The group of first years</i>
<i>who find me unsatisfactory,</i>

31:50.560 --> 31:51.320
<i>Erika told me.</i>

31:51.400 --> 31:52.840
<i>Erika, your PhD?</i>

31:52.920 --> 31:55.000
<i>It's fine, she's</i>
<i>great, I trust her.</i>

31:55.080 --> 31:57.160
<i>I'm sure she is, but</i>
<i>this is your relationship</i>

31:57.240 --> 31:59.000
<i>with your first years and you</i>
<i>need to be in charge of it,</i>

31:59.080 --> 31:59.800
<i>just you.</i>

32:03.120 --> 32:04.640
<i>You're right.</i>

32:04.720 --> 32:07.160
<i>Can I ask your advice about</i>
<i>something a bit weird?</i>

32:17.040 --> 32:19.040
<i>I think all that stuff</i>
<i>with Emma made us close</i>

32:19.120 --> 32:23.160
<i>and well, we probably</i>
<i>developed a bit of a crush</i>

32:23.240 --> 32:25.960
<i>on each other and things</i>
<i>were said and then</i>

32:26.040 --> 32:28.080
<i>I didn't see him again</i>
<i>until the commendation.</i>

32:28.160 --> 32:32.120
<i>And then he was there with</i>
<i>his drop dead gorgeous wife,</i>

32:32.200 --> 32:34.320
<i>and it's so ridiculous,</i>

32:34.400 --> 32:36.320
<i>I just behaved like</i>
<i>a jabbering arse.</i>

32:36.400 --> 32:38.720
<i>Is that why you were</i>
<i>red in the face?</i>

32:38.800 --> 32:40.400
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:40.480 --> 32:43.480
<i>I thought it was from wine,</i>
<i>from the sulfites in wine.</i>

32:43.560 --> 32:45.520
<i>No, it was for me being</i>
<i>embarrassed and jealous</i>

32:45.600 --> 32:47.120
<i>and flustered and stupid.</i>

32:47.200 --> 32:48.960
<i>And now he's asked me</i>
<i>not to ring him at night.</i>

32:50.720 --> 32:51.640
<i>Should I say something to him?</i>

32:51.720 --> 32:52.760
<i>Hold on.</i>

32:52.840 --> 32:54.840
<i>What words were said?</i>

32:54.920 --> 32:57.160
<i>You asked us all back to yours</i>
<i>and he said something like,</i>

32:57.240 --> 32:58.880
<i>he wasn't gonna do that</i>
<i>'cause he might say</i>

32:58.960 --> 33:00.840
<i>something foolish, and</i>
<i>I said something like,</i>

33:00.920 --> 33:02.040
<i>"Oh, I would love that."</i>

33:05.000 --> 33:05.960
<i>Is that it?</i>

33:06.040 --> 33:07.320
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:07.400 --> 33:08.680
<i>And you didn't see</i>
<i>each other again</i>

33:08.760 --> 33:09.840
<i>until the commendation?</i>

33:09.920 --> 33:10.880
<i>No.</i>

33:10.960 --> 33:12.040
<i>Talk on the phone?</i>

33:12.120 --> 33:13.240
<i>No.</i>

33:13.320 --> 33:14.600
<i>So what do you wanna say to him?</i>

33:14.680 --> 33:17.320
<i>His wife probably thinks</i>
<i>I'm infatuated with him</i>

33:17.400 --> 33:19.320
<i>or something, but I'm not.</i>

33:19.400 --> 33:21.200
<i>Just come clean.</i>

33:22.840 --> 33:25.040
<i>Are you insane?! There's</i>
<i>nothing to come clean about.</i>

33:26.680 --> 33:29.240
<i>What was his reason for asking</i>
<i>you to not call at night?</i>

33:29.320 --> 33:31.200
<i>Work-life balance.</i>

33:31.280 --> 33:33.080
<i>Good reason, I believe it.</i>

33:33.160 --> 33:34.440
<i>So what do I do?</i>

33:34.520 --> 33:37.120
<i>Nothing, Sarah, get a</i>
<i>grip, you do nothing.</i>

33:37.200 --> 33:38.120
<i>You know why?</i>

33:38.200 --> 33:39.680
<i>Because nothing happened.</i>

33:39.760 --> 33:42.200
<i>God, you are so-</i>

33:42.280 --> 33:43.080
<i>Stupid?</i>

33:43.160 --> 33:44.120
<i>Catholic.</i>

33:54.120 --> 33:57.120
<i>The chemical residue from</i>
<i>inside the pipes been analysed,</i>

33:57.200 --> 33:59.320
<i>the explosive material</i>
<i>used was gunpowder.</i>

33:59.400 --> 34:00.640
<i>Where would they get gunpowder?</i>

34:00.720 --> 34:02.240
<i>Fireworks.</i>

34:02.320 --> 34:04.280
<i>There's a tiny package</i>
<i>of gunpowder in each one,</i>

34:04.360 --> 34:07.480
<i>you'd need to unwrap them,</i>
<i>empty them, amass the contents,</i>

34:07.560 --> 34:08.800
<i>pack it inside the pipe.</i>

34:08.880 --> 34:10.320
<i>How skilled you'd need to be?</i>

34:10.400 --> 34:12.120
<i>Anyone could do it,</i>
<i>there's manuals online</i>

34:12.200 --> 34:15.400
<i>if you know where to</i>
<i>look, there's 'cookbooks'.</i>

34:15.480 --> 34:17.840
<i>Our guy didn't even have the</i>
<i>skill to set the time right.</i>

34:17.920 --> 34:19.680
<i>Who says it's a guy?</i>

34:19.760 --> 34:22.880
<i>Hm, he or she, had a</i>
<i>lot to think about.</i>

34:22.960 --> 34:26.120
<i>With bombs it usually is</i>
<i>a he, but we can't say.</i>

34:26.200 --> 34:28.920
<i>If you were gonna make a</i>
<i>bomb, this is one you'd make.</i>

34:30.080 --> 34:31.160
<i>What tools would you need?</i>

34:31.240 --> 34:34.040
<i>Basic tools, but useful for us.</i>

34:34.120 --> 34:36.480
<i>Here are the tool marks at</i>
<i>the end of ne of the wires,</i>

34:36.560 --> 34:37.760
<i>marks from pliers.</i>

34:39.400 --> 34:41.920
<i>And this is a piece of wire</i>
<i>embedded in the victim.</i>

34:42.000 --> 34:45.280
<i>It showed up when the</i>
<i>pathologist CT scanned his body.</i>

34:45.360 --> 34:48.880
<i>Same tool marks, see, there's</i>
<i>a scratch across the ridge</i>

34:48.960 --> 34:50.840
<i>made by the pincers</i>
<i>of the pliers.</i>

34:50.920 --> 34:52.640
<i>You're looking for</i>
<i>that specific tool.</i>

34:55.160 --> 34:55.880
<i>And then,</i>

34:57.760 --> 34:59.480
<i>hashtag one,</i>

34:59.560 --> 35:01.600
<i>could have been on</i>
<i>the wood before,</i>

35:01.680 --> 35:03.680
<i>could be nothing to</i>
<i>do with anything.</i>

35:03.760 --> 35:07.080
<i>It could be the bomber,</i>
<i>telling us this is a campaign.</i>

35:12.240 --> 35:13.920
<i>So one of the women that</i>
<i>goes to the Pilates class,</i>

35:14.000 --> 35:15.360
<i>she just got out of</i>
<i>this relationship with a</i>

35:15.440 --> 35:17.720
<i>physically abusive guy.</i>

35:17.800 --> 35:20.760
<i>He threatened to kill</i>
<i>her if she left him,</i>

35:20.840 --> 35:22.080
<i>but we're getting him in.</i>

35:22.160 --> 35:24.720
<i>If it's him, maybe we're</i>
<i>looking at a one off.</i>

35:24.800 --> 35:25.560
<i>Right.</i>

35:27.200 --> 35:28.560
<i>You don't think it's a one off?</i>

35:28.640 --> 35:29.680
<i>I hope it is.</i>

35:31.360 --> 35:33.520
<i>And with multiple devices,</i>
<i>they're often set to off</i>

35:33.600 --> 35:35.520
<i>at the same time to scatter</i>
<i>the emergency response,</i>

35:35.600 --> 35:36.880
<i>so that didn't happen, so...</i>

35:38.680 --> 35:39.600
<i>Keep me in the loop.</i>

35:40.920 --> 35:41.840
<i>I'll get my finished</i>
<i>report to you next week.</i>

35:41.920 --> 35:42.720
<i>Sarah,</i>

35:45.280 --> 35:47.560
<i>I think I might have</i>
<i>hurt your feelings.</i>

35:47.640 --> 35:48.640
<i>No, you haven't.</i>

35:50.280 --> 35:53.880
<i>Okay, just I thought our</i>
<i>conversation the other day,</i>

35:53.960 --> 35:56.280
<i>maybe turned a wee bit awkward.</i>

35:57.560 --> 35:58.360
<i>God.</i>

36:00.680 --> 36:02.480
<i>We can handle a bit</i>
<i>of awkward, can't we?</i>

36:04.280 --> 36:05.800
<i>I hope so.</i>

36:05.880 --> 36:06.680
<i>Good.</i>

36:07.680 --> 36:08.480
<i>So,</i>

36:09.840 --> 36:10.600
<i>are we good?</i>

36:11.720 --> 36:12.520
<i>We're good.</i>

36:15.480 --> 36:17.040
<i>I'd hate for us not to be good.</i>

36:19.600 --> 36:20.360
<i>Me too.</i>

36:25.360 --> 36:26.280
<i>I'll see ya.</i>

36:27.520 --> 36:28.320
<i>Bye.</i>

36:34.440 --> 36:35.800
<i>Mr. MacAfee?</i>

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
<i>I love you.</i>

36:42.920 --> 36:44.320
<i>I love you too.</i>

37:13.800 --> 37:17.320
<i>When you go in, the witness</i>
<i>box is on your left-hand side.</i>

37:17.400 --> 37:18.160
<i>Thanks.</i>

37:53.240 --> 37:56.120
<i>Daniel MacAfee, do</i>
<i>wish to take the oath</i>

37:56.200 --> 37:58.480
<i>or do you wish to have affirm?</i>

37:58.560 --> 37:59.840
<i>Affirm.</i>

37:59.920 --> 38:02.520
<i>Raise your right hand</i>
<i>and repeat after me.</i>

38:02.600 --> 38:07.400
<i>I solemnly, sincerely and</i>
<i>truly declare and affirm.</i>

38:09.120 --> 38:11.120
<i>I solemnly, sincerely and</i>
<i>truly declare and affirm.</i>

38:11.200 --> 38:14.080
<i>That I shall tell</i>
<i>the truth, the whole truth</i>

38:14.160 --> 38:15.800
<i>and nothing but the truth.</i>

38:15.880 --> 38:18.200
<i>I shall tell the</i>
<i>truth, the whole truth</i>

38:19.200 --> 38:20.280
<i>and nothing but the truth.</i>

38:23.560 --> 38:26.120
<i>When you made this discovery</i>
<i>that your father had done</i>

38:26.200 --> 38:29.440
<i>digging work two days after</i>
<i>the Tall Ships Festival,</i>

38:29.520 --> 38:32.880
<i>why did you tell DI</i>
<i>McKinven about it?</i>

38:32.960 --> 38:34.680
<i>I thought it might possibly</i>
<i>have something to do</i>

38:34.760 --> 38:36.000
<i>with Marie Monroe's murder.</i>

38:37.560 --> 38:38.480
<i>Did you</i>
<i>think that your Father</i>

38:38.560 --> 38:40.840
<i>had killed Marie Monroe?</i>

38:49.600 --> 38:51.040
<i>I believed it was possible.</i>

38:51.120 --> 38:53.480
<i>You believed your father</i>
<i>was capable of murder?</i>

38:58.240 --> 39:01.480
<i>I thought it was a possibility,</i>
<i>at that point, yes.</i>

39:02.920 --> 39:05.920
<i>Can we rewind a bit?</i>

39:06.000 --> 39:07.920
<i>Can you give a brief</i>
<i>account of what happened</i>

39:08.000 --> 39:09.880
<i>on the night of</i>
<i>September the 20th?</i>

39:11.560 --> 39:13.720
<i>I came home from work and</i>
<i>saw Emma, my girlfriend,</i>

39:13.800 --> 39:17.000
<i>hanging off my balcony,</i>
<i>which is three floors up.</i>

39:17.080 --> 39:19.080
<i>My dad was stood on the balcony,</i>

39:19.160 --> 39:21.560
<i>the guy in the flat below</i>
<i>helped Emma to safety,</i>

39:21.640 --> 39:23.760
<i>and Emma reported my</i>
<i>dad to the police.</i>

39:23.840 --> 39:25.080
<i>What for?</i>

39:25.160 --> 39:26.040
<i>Threatening her to</i>
<i>the point where she</i>

39:26.120 --> 39:27.880
<i>climbed over the balcony.</i>

39:27.960 --> 39:29.960
<i>My dad said it was</i>
<i>a misunderstanding.</i>

39:30.040 --> 39:31.240
<i>Did you believe him?</i>

39:31.320 --> 39:34.760
<i>Yeah, because I trusted</i>
<i>him, at that time.</i>

39:34.840 --> 39:36.320
<i>Why?</i>

39:36.400 --> 39:37.400
<i>Because I loved him.</i>

39:39.120 --> 39:41.160
<i>Has your father ever</i>
<i>been threatening to you?</i>

39:41.240 --> 39:42.800
<i>Objection, M'Lord.</i>

39:42.880 --> 39:44.600
<i>The relationship between</i>
<i>this witness and my client</i>

39:44.680 --> 39:46.880
<i>is not on trial,</i>
<i>this is irrelevant.</i>

39:46.960 --> 39:48.720
<i>Objection repelled.</i>

39:48.800 --> 39:50.920
<i>I want to hear more</i>
<i>about the relationship</i>

39:51.000 --> 39:55.360
<i>and I'm sure ladies</i>
<i>and gentlemen of the</i>
<i>jury want to too.</i>

39:55.440 --> 39:56.280
<i>As you were.</i>

39:58.600 --> 40:00.960
<i>Has your father ever</i>
<i>been threatening to you?</i>

40:01.960 --> 40:03.280
<i>Yes.</i>

40:03.360 --> 40:05.120
<i>Before or after the</i>
<i>balcony incident?</i>

40:05.200 --> 40:06.680
<i>After.</i>

40:06.760 --> 40:08.680
<i>I asked him some</i>
<i>questions he didn't like.</i>

40:10.080 --> 40:11.600
<i>I asked him about</i>
<i>cheating a client,</i>

40:11.680 --> 40:13.160
<i>which I could prove he'd</i>
<i>done and I asked them about</i>

40:13.240 --> 40:15.560
<i>being unfaithful to my</i>
<i>mother when she had cancer,</i>

40:15.640 --> 40:16.920
<i>which my mom had</i>
<i>just told me about.</i>

40:17.000 --> 40:18.760
<i>How did</i>
<i>he threaten you?</i>

40:18.840 --> 40:21.160
<i>You're the fucking little</i>
<i>prince of getting away with it.</i>

40:21.240 --> 40:23.040
<i>You're a spoilt wee</i>
<i>bastard with no talent.</i>

40:23.120 --> 40:24.960
<i>You can get to fuck!</i>

40:25.040 --> 40:26.840
<i>Character assassination,</i>
<i>basically.</i>

40:28.680 --> 40:31.400
<i>And he told me that if</i>
<i>I took him on, he'd win,</i>

40:31.480 --> 40:32.800
<i>warning me off.</i>

40:32.880 --> 40:35.280
<i>Had he ever verbally</i>
<i>attacked you before?</i>

40:36.560 --> 40:37.320
<i>Never.</i>

40:39.840 --> 40:41.760
<i>I've never seen</i>
<i>that side to him.</i>

40:41.840 --> 40:43.960
<i>Did it make you</i>
<i>reconsider Emma's account</i>

40:44.040 --> 40:45.200
<i>of the balcony incident?</i>

40:46.680 --> 40:48.280
<i>Yes.</i>

40:48.360 --> 40:50.720
<i>Can you describe the</i>
<i>side of your father</i>

40:50.800 --> 40:51.880
<i>you hadn't seen before?</i>

40:55.720 --> 40:57.280
<i>Someone who'll do</i>
<i>whatever it takes</i>

40:57.360 --> 41:01.080
<i>to get what he wants or to get</i>
<i>out of what he doesn't want.</i>

41:01.160 --> 41:03.000
<i>Why hadn't</i>
<i>you seen it before?</i>

41:07.280 --> 41:08.880
<i>Because I'd never</i>
<i>stood up to him before.</i>

41:11.320 --> 41:13.160
<i>I thought he was perfect.</i>

41:28.080 --> 41:29.960
<i>Do you want to take a break?</i>

41:30.040 --> 41:31.400
<i>Okay.</i>

41:31.480 --> 41:33.720
<i>You know, it's one thing</i>
<i>to say these things</i>

41:33.800 --> 41:36.360
<i>in the comfort of the Procurator</i>
<i>Fiscals Office, it's a,</i>

41:36.440 --> 41:37.960
<i>it's quite another to</i>
<i>say them in front of the</i>

41:38.040 --> 41:39.200
<i>15 members of the jury.</i>

41:42.120 --> 41:43.840
<i>Having doubts about your story?</i>

41:43.920 --> 41:45.000
<i>You making it up?</i>

41:45.080 --> 41:46.400
<i>No.</i>

41:46.480 --> 41:47.920
<i>You feeling remorse?</i>

41:51.280 --> 41:52.560
<i>No.</i>

41:52.640 --> 41:53.160
<i>What's upsetting you?</i>

41:56.160 --> 41:57.400
<i>I don't know.</i>

41:57.480 --> 42:02.080
<i>We've heard how you</i>
<i>went from being son who,</i>

42:02.160 --> 42:05.720
<i>who loved his father to a</i>
<i>son who thought his father</i>

42:05.800 --> 42:07.720
<i>was capable of murder.</i>

42:07.800 --> 42:10.640
<i>And this change of</i>
<i>heart was brought about</i>

42:10.720 --> 42:13.680
<i>by a series of events,</i>
<i>which caused you to</i>

42:13.760 --> 42:16.360
<i>revise your opinion</i>
<i>of your father.</i>

42:18.200 --> 42:19.880
<i>Yes.</i>

42:19.960 --> 42:23.960
<i>Yes, in fact, what brought</i>
<i>about this drastic u-turn,</i>

42:25.280 --> 42:26.920
<i>and in a such a</i>
<i>short space of time,</i>

42:27.000 --> 42:30.840
<i>was that you started a</i>
<i>relationship with Emma Hedges</i>

42:30.920 --> 42:33.680
<i>and she turned your</i>
<i>world upside down.</i>

42:33.760 --> 42:34.960
<i>Now, isn't that right?</i>

42:47.040 --> 42:47.840
<i>Shit!</i>
