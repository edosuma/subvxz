01:54.282 --> 01:55.658
Wuchang has fallen.

01:56.659 --> 01:58.577
As expected.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.998
Wise to withdraw our troops
when we did.

02:06.419 --> 02:07.920
What else?

02:10.298 --> 02:13.426
My apologies, Empress,
for taking so long to come and visit.

02:13.509 --> 02:16.429
I trust your accommodations
have been to your liking?

02:17.430 --> 02:19.723
A cell is a cell,
no matter the decor.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.475
I could put you in a real cell, Empress,

02:21.559 --> 02:23.936
and prove that assumption so very wrong.

02:26.147 --> 02:28.566
I feel as if
I may have sprained my wrist.

02:30.193 --> 02:32.570
That's what your champion
took out of me.

02:33.612 --> 02:36.199
The blind man was more agile,
truth be told.

02:36.282 --> 02:38.992
Interesting choice for an assassin.

02:39.076 --> 02:42.746
I would have selected
someone with... eyes.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.833
Even Fang Zhen seemed surprised by him.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.336
Someone had to allow him inside.

02:49.545 --> 02:52.298
I wish to see the Emperor.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.467
I wish to see Ling.

02:55.676 --> 02:59.305
Ling is dancing her days away,

02:59.388 --> 03:02.850
and the Emperor is occupied
with complicated matters of state.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.894
I will send them your regards.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.566
In the meantime,

03:10.649 --> 03:13.777
we will continue to detain you
so as to protect you

03:13.861 --> 03:16.572
from murderers and assassins
who could strike at any moment.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.339
[horseman shouting indistinctly]

03:34.548 --> 03:35.924
Father!

03:36.008 --> 03:37.968
How fared you at Wuchang?

03:38.051 --> 03:40.263
We saw victory, daughter.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.184
The sight of you pleases me more.

03:48.521 --> 03:49.647
The Khan awaits you.

03:50.648 --> 03:52.483
He will wait a moment more.

03:53.526 --> 03:56.612
You have represented me well
in the Khan's court.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.947
Word is you are as formidable as ever.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.575
[Khutulun] On this...

04:01.659 --> 04:05.371
word is not as true
as it was even yesterday.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.878
I was bested, Father.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.923
He must be a formidable wrestler.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.802
The Khan's warrior son, Byamba.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.307
Do not be displeased, Father.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.477
Did you surrender your honor?

04:29.937 --> 04:32.856
I surrendered mine to serve yours.

04:32.940 --> 04:36.944
You wanted me closer
to the Khan's court, yes?

04:39.447 --> 04:40.739
I approve, daughter.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.867
You should pursue the warrior.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.245
[Kublai] House of Ögödei...

04:47.330 --> 04:48.872
[Kublai laughing]

04:51.959 --> 04:54.252
Your Golden Horde took Wuchang.

04:55.170 --> 04:58.424
As planned, Xiangyang
will not be resupplied.

04:58.507 --> 04:59.508
Mmm.

04:59.592 --> 05:01.635
Jingim's assault there was bloody.

05:01.719 --> 05:03.136
[Kaidu] We fared well, Great Khan.

05:03.220 --> 05:06.432
But we had the men
and horses necessary.

05:07.391 --> 05:11.645
Their numbers seemed reduced,
but those who remained fought well.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.273
We marched the captured here
as slaves for your service.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.818
Your Khan is honored,
offers his welcome.

05:17.901 --> 05:21.071
Come. Let us raise
a cup in your honor.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.705
[door opening]

05:32.333 --> 05:34.752
War is on.
We need to escape now.

05:35.711 --> 05:38.589
I begged you to leave, Tulga,
to save us.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.174
And you said you prayed to join me
in this life or the next.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.427
I give you that choice now!

05:43.511 --> 05:45.721
I am to leave with
the ladies of the court.

05:45.804 --> 05:46.889
They will know I am gone!

05:49.683 --> 05:50.893
I cannot go with you.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.771
I do not want to!

05:55.105 --> 05:57.608
Then we shall live together
in the Blue Sky.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.984
[Kokachin gasps]

05:59.067 --> 06:01.111
- [door opening]
- [Za Bing] Get away from her!

06:01.194 --> 06:02.530
[Za Bing yelling]

06:05.157 --> 06:06.659
[Tulga] Kokachin!

06:06.742 --> 06:09.077
Za Bing, no!

06:10.413 --> 06:11.872
[Za Bing grunts]

06:11.955 --> 06:13.165
[Tulga gasping]

06:13.248 --> 06:15.042
The skulking is over.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.421
There is no love
with the Blue Princess.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.714
She harbors no feelings for you.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.717
Leave!

06:24.927 --> 06:26.261
Now!

06:29.515 --> 06:30.974
- Ahh!
- [Kokachin gasps]

06:34.394 --> 06:35.979
[Za Bing groaning]

06:36.063 --> 06:37.105
Za Bing!

06:37.189 --> 06:38.732
Nergüi?

06:38.816 --> 06:39.858
What have you done?

06:39.942 --> 06:41.860
[guards shouting]

06:42.861 --> 06:44.362
[sobbing]

07:25.237 --> 07:26.822
[sobbing] I'm sorry.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.281
[guards shouting]

07:28.365 --> 07:30.200
I'm sorry.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.327
I'm sorry.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.381
[Ling Ling sniffling]

07:46.967 --> 07:48.051
[yelps]

07:51.304 --> 07:52.347
[whimpering]

07:55.017 --> 07:56.309
Barbarians.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.021
[healer] I must break the bones again

08:00.773 --> 08:02.315
to make them right.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.495
Do it.

08:17.706 --> 08:18.749
Heal her.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.000
[Ling Ling sniffling]

08:30.678 --> 08:32.513
Will you come out?

08:33.764 --> 08:37.893
Or just cling to the shadows
like a snake?

08:41.813 --> 08:43.607
[Ahmad] Snakes are not
attracted to shadows.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.317
A rat then.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.174
Have the Great Khan's troops
reached my home yet?

09:12.510 --> 09:15.097
They would slow their march
as they approach.

09:16.348 --> 09:19.935
Let your people suffer
the horror of anticipation.

09:23.188 --> 09:28.068
Wuchang first?
As you tried before.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.198
Kaidu of the Golden Horde
has led the assault.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.534
And succeeded
where my brother Jingim failed.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.706
I have a place
in the royal family.

09:42.708 --> 09:47.212
Are you a whore's son?
That would explain your interest in me.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.675
My interest in you is self-interest.

09:51.759 --> 09:55.638
I have nothing to offer you now.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.314
[door opens]

10:07.440 --> 10:08.692
[door closes]

10:17.785 --> 10:18.911
[Ahmad] You called for me?

10:18.994 --> 10:21.204
I thought you would have
left for the war camp.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.249
I want to know of the assassin's condition
before I depart.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.835
- Will she recover?
- Still uncertain.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.087
Has she offered anything of worth?

10:29.171 --> 10:34.301
No, Empress. Nothing of note.
Just mumbled worry for her daughter.

10:35.969 --> 10:39.556
Binding linen.
Her daughter resides with us.

10:43.393 --> 10:47.272
Or perhaps a resolution we seek
with something altogether different.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.899
You speak of amnesty?

10:48.982 --> 10:49.983
No, Empress.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.360
Her daughter survives.

10:52.444 --> 10:57.074
We now possess the same leverage
once held over her by Jia Sidao.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.868
When we need her,
she will do our bidding.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.244
Yes.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.707
Make sure she recovers.
Have news for me when I return.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.793
[Kublai] This is an accurate rendering,
Master Polo?

11:07.876 --> 11:10.921
[Marco] It is.
I saw the construction.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.589
The outer wall is a shell.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.342
There is no fortification.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.511
Crush the foot
and the body will fall.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.598
We take the city.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.434
Sidao will dirty his knees before me.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.187
[Jingim] The Chancellor is aware
he was infiltrated weeks ago.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.440
Surely, he does everything in his power
to bolster his defenses,

11:30.523 --> 11:31.649
rectify his weaknesses.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.987
[Marco] Our scouts report they have been
repairing the wall night and day,

11:35.070 --> 11:37.364
but it is still incomplete.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.700
We must strike immediately.

11:44.287 --> 11:48.541
Prince Jingim's words are
worthy of consideration.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.879
I can wait no longer.
Polo is right.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.422
If action is to be taken,
now is the time.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.134
Go as my envoy to Sidao.

11:57.217 --> 12:01.221
Extend an invitation for parley
on the eve of his defeat.

12:01.304 --> 12:04.808
If he bows to me,
he can avoid Mongol steel.

12:05.768 --> 12:09.687
Propose a peace, patience to him,
see what it gets you.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.901
Sidao will never be a subject
under the Khanate.

12:13.984 --> 12:16.194
And this offer will enrage him,

12:16.278 --> 12:20.740
but I've shown his council, army
and people that I'm a diplomat

12:20.824 --> 12:22.659
until the bitter end.

12:47.767 --> 12:52.230
You are the military emissary
to the Great Kublai Khan?

12:52.314 --> 12:57.069
I have that honor, Chancellor.
I am Vice Regent of the Secretariat.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.237
And a foreigner.

12:59.321 --> 13:01.531
You must be as wise
as you're ugly and odd.

13:03.450 --> 13:07.037
Have you ever seen an image of
the Roman emperor Claudius?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.997
Or the Hunnic ruler Attila?

13:09.081 --> 13:10.498
No.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.792
But you're now going to tell me
of the accomplishments

13:12.876 --> 13:14.962
of ugly men who were underestimated.

13:15.045 --> 13:19.925
I would not presume to educate you
on the wiles of political men,

13:20.008 --> 13:22.719
comely or otherwise, Chancellor.

13:22.802 --> 13:27.140
We had heard talk of Fang Zhen,
the Red Lotus,

13:27.224 --> 13:29.226
taking a role in your empire.

13:29.309 --> 13:33.563
There was an assassination attempt
in the fortress.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.358
Some tragedies were averted,
some were not.

13:36.441 --> 13:40.320
I was so deeply troubled
to hear of Kublai's own tragedy.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.074
Wives should not be taken
in such a fashion.

13:46.284 --> 13:49.246
It is a violation, yes.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.416
So...

13:53.500 --> 13:57.712
as fletchers stockpile arrows
and your blacksmiths sharpen steel,

13:57.795 --> 14:00.632
you come with a bidding
from your adopted master?

14:00.715 --> 14:05.012
The Great Khan offers a parley
to avert further tragedy

14:05.095 --> 14:07.389
and discuss peaceful arbitration.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.516
Surely you mean my subjugation?

14:09.599 --> 14:13.145
It is not for me
to interpret my liege's intent.

14:13.228 --> 14:16.106
As his minister,
isn't that exactly what you do,

14:16.189 --> 14:18.191
if not sculpt his intent yourself?

14:18.275 --> 14:20.903
I offer counsel.

14:20.986 --> 14:23.238
The Khan's decisions are his own.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.782
And do you agree
with his decisions?

14:30.620 --> 14:35.042
Kublai Khan is my leader, my guide.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.795
I serve God through serving him.

14:38.879 --> 14:43.216
The Khan is your divine conduit?

14:43.300 --> 14:44.426
[Yusuf] No.

14:45.260 --> 14:49.222
He is merely a man with a vision.

14:51.766 --> 14:56.646
A hard place, Vice Regent,
serving a will you do not endorse.

14:59.857 --> 15:03.486
Tell your master I will meet him
to hear his gracious offerings.

15:07.199 --> 15:08.992
Limp away now, messenger.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.253
[Khutulun] My father has
joined the war camp.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.507
Has Kaidu come for
the enemy's head or mine?

15:25.675 --> 15:29.304
He holds his oppositions
for Sidao, not us.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.599
What tactics do you devise?

15:34.101 --> 15:36.519
We ride as one tumen
along the bank.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.771
When the archer fires a whistler,
we disband.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.232
Wolf and crow.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.067
I take wolf, you take crow.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.987
Because you bested me?

15:46.571 --> 15:51.659
You think you will always ride wolf,
make me ride crow.

15:51.743 --> 15:57.165
I ride wolf because I have more lancers.
You have archers from the steppe.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.088
This is my father's tent.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.672
I don't care.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.652
Do you strategize
for the coming assault?

16:27.154 --> 16:29.447
Wolf rides crow?

16:32.784 --> 16:34.244
[sighs]

16:39.207 --> 16:42.294
We'll resume our war plans later.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.010
My Lady.

16:56.599 --> 16:59.269
Kaidu asked about you.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.897
How many horses in your herd,
how able a warrior.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.608
Now, I understand.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.737
He must check tooth and hoof
before settling terms.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.615
The union will please our father.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.742
And I will prove myself to Kaidu
in the shadow of the wall.

17:16.743 --> 17:19.497
- All will soon be settled.
- No doubt.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.250
Unless the war undoes us.

17:23.251 --> 17:27.255
Xiangyang will bow to our Khan.
We have the secret and the strategy.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.466
Why do you doubt?

17:29.549 --> 17:32.177
Our strategy turns
on a foreigner's secret.

17:33.178 --> 17:36.681
I do not trust the Latin
and neither does Ahmad.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.141
What does Ahmad know?

17:38.225 --> 17:40.560
Marco saved me
when he needn't have.

17:40.643 --> 17:42.687
He returned to Cambulac
when he could have fled.

17:42.770 --> 17:46.483
Byamba, we do not know
what bargain was struck in your saving,

17:46.566 --> 17:48.276
nor what motivated his return.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.862
Honor. Friendship.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.655
Perhaps.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.201
Would you offer evidence
to support your doubts?

18:00.455 --> 18:01.831
Better.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.584
My confidence.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.017
[prisoner] Hey, blond man.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.478
Blond.

18:24.646 --> 18:25.980
Come here.

18:30.193 --> 18:31.903
Do I look blond to you?

18:33.863 --> 18:35.115
Blonder than me.

18:36.741 --> 18:38.576
Do you have any food, Blond?

18:48.461 --> 18:50.046
Thank you.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.885
Are you a fair-skinned
bastard son of the Khan?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.262
[laughing]

18:57.345 --> 18:59.889
No, I am his servant.

19:01.808 --> 19:05.270
I, too, will become his servant,
given the chance.

19:05.353 --> 19:06.479
You wish to be?

19:07.564 --> 19:08.898
I wish nothing more.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.652
What skill do you have?

19:13.945 --> 19:15.238
I'm a weaver.

19:15.322 --> 19:18.741
The Khan is fond of
artisans of every type.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.868
I'm sure you will fare well.

19:22.912 --> 19:26.999
What if the Mongols lose?
Would you still wish to serve?

19:29.377 --> 19:34.757
Men follow leaders.
Sidao is half the man the Khan is.

19:36.133 --> 19:39.304
Kublai Khan will win.
He will rule.

19:40.513 --> 19:44.184
Had you no knife to your throat,
would you feel the same?

19:46.894 --> 19:48.480
I see no threat.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.399
Merely fence.

19:51.483 --> 19:52.817
[Marco chuckles]

19:52.900 --> 19:54.611
[prisoners clamoring]

19:54.694 --> 19:58.030
[prisoners]
Kublai! Kublai!

19:58.114 --> 20:01.201
They say the Khan welcomes anyone
if they pledge loyalty.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.828
Is it true, Blond?

20:05.205 --> 20:07.039
It is true.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.880
Will you come back, Blond?
Bring me more of that delicious meat?

20:19.636 --> 20:23.265
What is the state of power
within the fortress walls?

20:23.348 --> 20:26.518
I saw no sign of the Empress,
nor the Boy Emperor.

20:26.601 --> 20:31.022
We parleyed in the Song throne room
as though Jia Sidao were the emperor.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.816
Killed Red Lotus
and caged the boy.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.777
Conspiracies abound.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.737
He did imply one thing.

20:37.820 --> 20:41.866
I believe he's under the impression
that his sister was successful.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.618
He thinks Lady Chabi is dead.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.995
This misinformation could be useful

20:46.078 --> 20:47.747
in distressing his state of mind
at the parley.

20:47.830 --> 20:51.584
The more unstable his mind,
the more unstable his choices.

20:56.964 --> 21:00.092
Kaidu, welcome to the war.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.977
I have already fought one battle.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.481
It seems as if
you have as well.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.484
[Kaidu sighs]

21:16.568 --> 21:20.071
Of all the warriors my daughter wrestled,
she settled on you.

21:21.656 --> 21:22.865
Why is that?

21:22.949 --> 21:27.329
She didn't settle. I won.
And I have personality.

21:28.413 --> 21:30.206
- [Kaidu chuckles]
- I swear.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.836
I have my thoughts in battle now.

21:34.919 --> 21:38.005
You can denounce me and call me pig
if you like, but wait for tomorrow.

21:38.089 --> 21:41.468
- And if you fall in battle?
- I am not that lucky.

21:42.552 --> 21:43.928
Yes.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.724
I know of your prowess
on the field.

21:49.559 --> 21:52.520
Khutulun would never look your way
unless you were formidable.

21:53.521 --> 21:56.566
There's a reason
she leads one of my tumens.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.778
She knows strength and
noble character when she sees it.

22:02.697 --> 22:05.575
One wonders whether
the kingdom of Cambulac or its Khan

22:05.658 --> 22:07.243
have the same foresight.

22:10.413 --> 22:11.623
[sighs]

22:12.957 --> 22:14.584
Fare well tomorrow, Byamba.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.173
A fine horse.

22:22.634 --> 22:25.637
I am most pleased
it was not added to my herd.

22:41.277 --> 22:45.448
[Chabi] Our men suffer in furs and metal
under the South China sun.

22:46.491 --> 22:50.244
I had the armorer replace
all neck guards with hide.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.371
Jingim believes the Song Chancellor

22:52.455 --> 22:55.417
will never himself appear
on the field of battle.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.252
Of that, Sidao is wise.

22:59.504 --> 23:04.175
My son would cut him from gut to mouth
in front of his own men.

23:06.177 --> 23:09.556
But hiding will not save his life.

23:11.140 --> 23:15.269
My Khan, my son,
they will have what is due them.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.989
You suspected me
when the young concubine died.

23:28.491 --> 23:31.285
Why not accuse me of the crime?

23:31.368 --> 23:33.162
You were too precious to the Khan.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.499
And I sense promise in you.

23:37.459 --> 23:39.126
What promise?

23:40.294 --> 23:41.921
I do not yet know.

23:45.174 --> 23:47.469
Am I precious to you?

23:57.812 --> 23:59.355
Your brother...

24:00.607 --> 24:03.400
made you into a whore for his ambition.

24:06.028 --> 24:07.238
Did that bother you?

24:07.321 --> 24:09.240
I made myself a whore.

24:09.323 --> 24:12.744
And I used him long
before he learned to use me.

24:13.369 --> 24:17.624
When he was a boy and I a little girl
living in the shadow of Xiangyang.

24:20.417 --> 24:24.589
I stared at the Walled City,
dreaming what life might be like there.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.762
What did you dream as a boy?

24:30.845 --> 24:33.973
I suffered dreamless sleep.

24:37.644 --> 24:40.396
Did you come to the Khan's service
by choice?

24:40.479 --> 24:42.106
No.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.651
By chance?

24:47.987 --> 24:49.405
As chattel?

24:54.243 --> 24:55.787
Born of Persia?

24:56.996 --> 24:59.248
My people were the Fanākatī.

25:00.374 --> 25:03.545
I'm from Upper Asia, not Persia.

25:04.629 --> 25:07.381
And brought to China
to serve your conqueror.

25:08.215 --> 25:11.135
I was too young then
to know him as a conqueror.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.388
He was my...

25:14.471 --> 25:17.391
my patron, my benefactor.

25:20.436 --> 25:25.191
He became as a father to me,
and the Empress, a mother.

25:25.274 --> 25:29.904
What happened to your real mother,
your true father?

25:31.280 --> 25:33.532
Was the Khan their benefactor, too?

25:44.001 --> 25:47.797
How do you serve the monster
who slew your brethren

25:47.880 --> 25:50.132
and call him father?

25:52.301 --> 25:56.806
You worship his whores,
concubine and queen.

25:58.766 --> 26:02.854
And you are left here as nursemaid
while war is waged.

26:06.858 --> 26:08.275
[Mei Lin sighs]

26:21.748 --> 26:24.250
You attempt to crawl under my skin?

26:30.047 --> 26:32.383
I could get under your skin,

26:32.466 --> 26:36.095
carve it free
and wear it as a cloak.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.057
Better...

26:40.850 --> 26:45.062
I could walk next door and
do the same thing to your daughter.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.197
What do you mean?

26:56.741 --> 26:58.993
Please, what are you...
What are you saying?

26:59.076 --> 27:02.038
War is waged on many fronts, Mei Lin.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.164
[Mei Lin] Please...

27:04.206 --> 27:07.459
What...
What are you saying?

27:42.078 --> 27:45.206
I once saw an ink portrait
of your grandfather.

27:45.873 --> 27:49.460
You are a more striking figure,
I must say.

27:49.543 --> 27:52.046
My mother
was more beautiful than his.

27:53.422 --> 27:55.507
She was a Christian, was she not?

27:55.591 --> 27:58.677
She was daughter
and mother to Khans.

27:58.761 --> 28:01.597
She could choose
whichever God suited her.

28:04.683 --> 28:09.814
You ask for parley as you stand
with an army outside my city walls.

28:11.273 --> 28:12.900
How am I to take this?

28:12.984 --> 28:16.695
On bended knee, if you're wise.

28:16.779 --> 28:19.156
I have a wall.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.408
I will obliterate your wall.

28:21.492 --> 28:24.453
I will take your fraudulent crown

28:24.536 --> 28:28.457
and I will spike your corpse
to the gates of my new palace.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.837
Or I will walk through the wall

28:32.920 --> 28:38.050
after it is freely opened,
accept your surrender

28:38.134 --> 28:42.179
and offer gracious terms for
the deposed Chancellor of Xiangyang

28:42.263 --> 28:44.223
and his rebel army.

28:44.306 --> 28:47.268
You have power yet
to save your people, Sidao.

28:50.855 --> 28:51.939
[clicks tongue]

28:52.023 --> 28:55.442
It's unfortunate
that it has come to this.

28:55.526 --> 28:59.822
So deep into war that we make attempts
on each other's lives

28:59.906 --> 29:02.283
and those most sacred to us.

29:02.366 --> 29:05.828
I've heard of
your favored wife's beauty.

29:05.912 --> 29:09.081
Such luminescence
should not be taken from us this way.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.626
So repugnant.

29:12.709 --> 29:15.922
Even your own Vice Regent
is against this war.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.632
This tactics.

29:28.142 --> 29:31.771
When an honest man says nothing,
you see his heart.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.108
I don't question his loyalty to you,

29:36.192 --> 29:40.112
but an absence of words speaks loudly.

29:42.824 --> 29:46.535
Perhaps he sees something we do not.

29:49.789 --> 29:53.250
I trust I'll find you
on the field, Jia Sidao.

30:02.468 --> 30:05.847
May I introduce my luminescent wife,
the Empress Chabi.

30:13.312 --> 30:17.316
I'm greatly pleased
to see you well, Empress.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.568
The Chancellor has declined my offer.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.737
There will be no peace this day.

30:22.321 --> 30:27.076
I will rip away his land as I would
a weak heart from a coward's chest.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.369
[soldiers shout in unison]

30:28.995 --> 30:32.498
Your people make better
slaves than soldiers, Sidao.

30:33.624 --> 30:36.752
Fear not, I will reform them!

30:36.836 --> 30:37.962
[Kublai laughing]

30:38.045 --> 30:39.630
[prisoners shouting]

30:41.548 --> 30:43.968
[shouting continues]

31:40.774 --> 31:42.944
I couldn't look away
when I first saw you.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.738
I tried.

31:46.822 --> 31:49.325
I tried to look away.

31:49.408 --> 31:54.121
I told myself, "She is nothing
but a whore, like the others.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.291
Like my sister.

31:58.417 --> 32:03.714
Meant to be used and discarded
to make room for another."

32:34.620 --> 32:36.455
I tried to find logic...

32:38.457 --> 32:44.755
only to realize what I feel for you
defies such reasoning.

34:04.543 --> 34:05.877
I loved you.

34:07.588 --> 34:08.880
You lied to me.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.094
[sobbing]

34:46.627 --> 34:48.295
[gasping]

34:53.259 --> 34:54.592
[sword clattering]

35:14.070 --> 35:15.281
[Marco] You see?

35:16.782 --> 35:17.824
[laughs] I don't.

35:17.908 --> 35:20.076
It's right here.
The horse.

35:21.370 --> 35:24.206
This is the horse,
this is the camel.

35:24.290 --> 35:27.251
That's the sheep and that's the goat.

35:27.334 --> 35:29.461
You see now?

35:31.755 --> 35:34.258
Roll. I'll show you.

35:39.305 --> 35:41.723
- [prisoner] Where do you live?
- That's the sheep...

35:42.933 --> 35:44.476
Inside the Imperial City.

35:45.936 --> 35:48.980
- An honor.
- It has become one.

35:50.607 --> 35:51.733
It wasn't always?

35:53.152 --> 35:55.404
I, like you, was once a prisoner.

35:56.405 --> 35:58.740
Within a slightly more gilded cage.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.284
[chuckles]

36:02.328 --> 36:03.829
I've never left home.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.332
Well...

36:07.666 --> 36:08.959
that's about to change.

36:10.043 --> 36:13.589
Yes. Wheeled away
in a celled wagon.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.091
Only until you arrive in Cambulac.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.887
Will I live in the Imperial City?

36:22.181 --> 36:23.807
Doubtful.

36:23.890 --> 36:26.477
But it will be a step up
from your current station.

36:30.772 --> 36:33.149
What will you miss most of all?

36:34.693 --> 36:36.403
[prisoner] Of my home?

36:41.492 --> 36:43.869
Can't think of anything.

36:45.829 --> 36:47.539
What do you miss
of your home, Blond?

36:52.711 --> 36:54.380
It's a horse.

36:59.301 --> 37:01.220
[Marco] What is it, friend?

37:01.303 --> 37:04.806
Jingim Khan has much to say
on the subject of Marco Polo.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.099
[Marco scoffs]

37:06.182 --> 37:10.020
He has high regard for
my political acumen, no doubt.

37:10.103 --> 37:13.524
He suspects you and your father
plot against the Khan.

37:16.277 --> 37:20.864
Ahmad has fueled his jealousy.
They believe you have seduced my father.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.789
Where do you stand, Byamba?

37:30.123 --> 37:34.753
You are not of this place, Marco.
Jingim is my brother.

37:34.836 --> 37:38.757
And what recourse
does your brother propose?

37:38.840 --> 37:42.553
In battle, arrows fly from all directions.

37:42.636 --> 37:45.389
Heed the advice
you should have taken long ago.

37:46.890 --> 37:52.688
As we advance south,
you ride west, towards your home.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.819
Where you belong.

38:04.366 --> 38:06.743
[prisoners shouting]

38:09.455 --> 38:10.997
[prisoner screaming]

38:27.723 --> 38:29.182
[screaming]

39:30.869 --> 39:32.871
[Hundred Eyes] They are to be
rendered into a weapon

39:32.954 --> 39:35.165
to rain fire upon Xiangyang.

39:35.248 --> 39:38.001
It is the Khan's strategy.

39:38.084 --> 39:40.421
He uses Sidao's citizens against him.

39:41.922 --> 39:44.340
[prisoner] I pledge my life
to the Great Khan!

39:44.425 --> 39:46.552
I pledge my life
to the Great Khan!

39:46.635 --> 39:49.388
- No.
- [prisoner] Blond! Blond!

39:49.471 --> 39:52.766
If you cannot bear what you see,
avert your eyes.

39:55.769 --> 39:57.604
They are our captives.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.566
This is sin!

40:00.649 --> 40:03.985
It is war.
Your Khan's war.

40:05.153 --> 40:08.198
Blond! Blond, help me!

40:08.281 --> 40:09.575
[prisoner grunting]

40:11.367 --> 40:15.121
I want to go home!
I want to go home!

40:16.623 --> 40:18.124
[prisoner screaming]

40:38.186 --> 40:40.814
[Kokachin]
Where are you going?

40:44.150 --> 40:46.653
What are you doing here?

40:50.949 --> 40:52.743
What happened?

40:54.285 --> 40:55.704
Are you hurt?

40:55.787 --> 40:57.581
[Kokachin] Za Bing was killed.

41:07.716 --> 41:09.342
[Kokachin sniffles]

41:14.598 --> 41:16.975
This is a dark time.

41:17.058 --> 41:20.729
There are eyes on me,
doubts directed.

41:21.855 --> 41:24.483
If anyone finds you here...

41:25.859 --> 41:27.694
You must go.

41:36.578 --> 41:38.539
I will return you to your ger.

41:42.292 --> 41:44.795
[Kokachin]
There will be eyes on me, as well.

41:49.424 --> 41:51.051
[shuddering]

41:54.179 --> 41:56.264
I am no royal.

42:03.814 --> 42:06.733
When the Khan's men
attacked the Bayaut...

42:07.984 --> 42:10.654
[sighs deeply]

42:10.737 --> 42:12.656
I was a peasant girl...

42:14.157 --> 42:16.034
serving in the palace.

42:18.494 --> 42:22.082
When they left,
I went with them to Cambulac...

42:23.416 --> 42:24.500
as Kokachin.

42:25.794 --> 42:28.171
You took her name?

42:28.254 --> 42:30.591
She took her life.

42:32.050 --> 42:34.469
I took her name.

42:36.930 --> 42:39.641
I must hold it forever.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.064
Her name is yours.

42:47.774 --> 42:49.150
Kokachin.

42:50.235 --> 42:52.237
I will protect that name.

42:53.238 --> 42:54.530
And you.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.063
[grunting]

43:31.777 --> 43:34.362
Does my husband require assistance?

43:34.445 --> 43:35.488
[Kublai grunts]

43:36.447 --> 43:40.451
Warm air constricts
the metal, leather...

43:40.535 --> 43:42.287
armor shrinks.

43:44.665 --> 43:46.166
No need.

43:46.249 --> 43:47.668
[breathing heavily]

43:49.210 --> 43:52.839
My soldiers with sturdy backs
will surround me.

43:52.923 --> 43:54.257
[sighs heavily]

43:55.175 --> 43:58.261
They will take stray arrows
for their Khan.

44:00.931 --> 44:03.934
My fierce Mongol warriors...

44:06.144 --> 44:08.563
so many will perish tomorrow.

44:11.191 --> 44:12.275
[Chabi] Yes.

44:13.526 --> 44:16.071
- You must rest, Kublai.
- Mmm.

44:17.906 --> 44:19.490
Genghis said...

44:20.491 --> 44:23.704
"There's no good in anything
until it's finished."

44:25.831 --> 44:28.166
Tomorrow...

44:28.249 --> 44:31.670
the wall that turned back
the Mongols for 80 years...

44:33.338 --> 44:35.506
will fall.

44:36.842 --> 44:39.219
Your men are prepared.

44:39.302 --> 44:42.638
And behind them,
Mongol women ready to fight if needed.

44:42.723 --> 44:43.932
[sighs]

44:45.308 --> 44:48.687
You do this and our house is whole,

44:49.687 --> 44:53.483
your legacy secured
for yourself and our son.

44:53.566 --> 44:54.609
Mmm.

44:54.692 --> 44:59.948
One Khanate, one Khan.
One China, one Emperor.

45:00.031 --> 45:01.574
[chuckles]

45:01.657 --> 45:02.658
Indeed.

45:03.659 --> 45:09.124
You will destroy the wall, my husband.
You will have the Chancellor's head.

45:09.207 --> 45:10.541
Hmm.

45:12.418 --> 45:16.047
I wish my astrologers
had such hopeful foretellings.

45:16.131 --> 45:20.510
But there is no good in anything
until it is finished.

45:21.928 --> 45:24.305
Let this war earn your peace.

45:24.389 --> 45:27.600
Let it be your final conquest,
my Khan Kublai.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.938
Let it be finished.

45:47.453 --> 45:48.997
[soldiers urging horses]

45:54.502 --> 45:56.504
[soldier commanding indistinctly]

45:56.587 --> 46:01.509
Let our horses be swift
and our arrows true.

46:01.592 --> 46:04.012
This day will be ours, Father.

46:04.095 --> 46:05.263
[Kublai] Hmm.

46:07.849 --> 46:12.145
Polo, I bid you watch
the battle with me from the crest.

46:13.354 --> 46:16.817
I ride with my Mongol brothers, Sire.

46:18.734 --> 46:19.903
So be it.

46:21.863 --> 46:24.032
I'll see you on the field.

46:24.115 --> 46:25.992
Do not lose your mount.

46:57.523 --> 47:00.776
- [soldiers yelling]
- [swords clanging]

47:03.779 --> 47:07.951
[Jingim] We advanced, slaughtering every
rebel who crossed our path.

47:10.203 --> 47:13.957
We reached the wall
and pushed towards the weakness,

47:14.040 --> 47:16.417
the one the Latin described.

47:16.501 --> 47:19.504
We breached the wall with
little more than battering rams.

47:20.588 --> 47:22.966
But our men were wedged into a dead end.

47:24.759 --> 47:26.427
Death rained down upon us.

47:28.013 --> 47:30.932
Oil, fire, arrows...

47:31.599 --> 47:32.934
Men died.

47:33.018 --> 47:35.020
Mongols died...

47:35.103 --> 47:39.607
because Master Marco
pointed our army into a trap.

47:40.984 --> 47:45.738
It was bait, Sire,
the weakness in the wall.

47:45.821 --> 47:47.782
Jia Sidao drew us into a trap.

47:50.076 --> 47:54.039
- I am sorry, Great Khan...
- Why do you feign contrition, Latin?

47:54.122 --> 47:57.667
Why are you not at the breast
of your master, Jia Sidao?

47:57.750 --> 47:58.793
Huh?

47:58.876 --> 48:01.587
You delivered us to the devil!
You betrayed us!

48:01.671 --> 48:04.007
You brought us to
our knees at the wall!

48:06.842 --> 48:08.636
Father...

48:08.719 --> 48:11.722
he has brought us nothing but ruin.

48:11.806 --> 48:13.474
You can see it.

48:13.558 --> 48:15.435
You can all see it!

48:15.518 --> 48:18.729
I devote myself to you, Great Khan.

48:18.813 --> 48:20.356
Enough of your twisted talk!

48:25.445 --> 48:27.613
You would protect him?

48:27.697 --> 48:30.450
He is not one of us, brother.

48:30.533 --> 48:32.493
He is the rot within our bones.

48:32.577 --> 48:35.205
He reported what he saw...

48:35.288 --> 48:37.165
as he was asked to do.

48:52.430 --> 48:53.473
Father...

48:56.351 --> 48:57.810
what shall we do?

49:04.609 --> 49:06.111
Retreat.

49:11.949 --> 49:13.951
