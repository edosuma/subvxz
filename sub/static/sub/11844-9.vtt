- Eight. There was eight pods originally.

00:10.310 --> 00:13.109
- You know about that.
- We never knew what happened to the other four.

00:13.179 --> 00:17.582
- They went to New York. - They want me
to go to New York to a- a summit meeting.

00:17.650 --> 00:21.052
- What, just you? We weren't invited?
- You lied to me about Viiandra.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.887
- I don't know-
- Shut up!

00:24.958 --> 00:27.928
- I'm going to New York.
- Fine! Go be with them!

00:27.994 --> 00:30.361
Don't worry.

00:30.430 --> 00:33.593
- It'll be okay.
- I know.

00:37.303 --> 00:41.297
- I had an experience once.
- Oh, right. Your abduction.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.843
I've got a feeling
it's about to happen again.

00:43.910 --> 00:46.777
Looks like there's no room for me.
just as well.

00:46.846 --> 00:49.440

Then you can stay.

00:49.516 --> 00:51.610
Let's go to New York.

01:20.647 --> 01:23.708

I mean, this whole thing-
coming here to the city, Rath, Lonnie.

01:28.688 --> 01:30.622
- It's a mistake.
- Max.

01:30.690 --> 01:33.921
What do I know about war
and peace and politics?

01:37.163 --> 01:39.894
I'm gonna blow it.
I'm gonna sit down at this meeting...

01:39.966 --> 01:42.298
and I'm gonna meet these people,
and they're gonna look at me...

01:42.368 --> 01:45.861
and they're gonna see this kid from
New Mexico who hasn't got a clue-

01:45.939 --> 01:48.840

- Relax. Relax.

Yo, even Max Evans can find his way
from the Empire State.

03:50.797 --> 03:54.028
- It's three blocks.
- You better hope you're right.

Without Max, no one at the summit's
gonna give you two the time of clay.

We are the originals. They are the rejects.

They gotta think he's turning into

They think he doesn't want
to spend Thanksgiving with his family.

- You know Max.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.706
- You got a serious problem.
- What?

08:28.774 --> 08:33.041
A very vicious rumor is going around
about you in school.

08:33.111 --> 08:36.446
I shouldn't make a bigger deal out of it than
it is, because I know we can take care of it.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.541
But it's just, like, everybody
is talking about it-

08:38.618 --> 08:41.212
- Maria.
- Okay.

08:41.287 --> 08:45.281
The word is that you
and Kyle slept together.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.622
I know. It's so humiliating.
I know.

08:47.693 --> 08:52.927

- Um, it's true.

08:52.999 --> 08:55.764
What?

08:55.835 --> 08:59.931
No, Liz. The rumor is that you
and Kyle Valenti slept together...

09:00.006 --> 09:02.134
as in, like, sexually.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.142

09:04.210 --> 09:06.577

virginity to Kyle.

That is a revelation,
and I don't know what that's about.

09:08.648 --> 09:11.743
- But why didn't you tell me?
- I was embarrassed.

09:11.817 --> 09:14.445
That is a completely unacceptable answer
for you to give to me...

09:14.520 --> 09:16.454
your best friend
in the entire world.

09:16.522 --> 09:19.753
- I didn't want to talk about it!
- Why?

09:19.825 --> 09:22.453
Why didn't you want to talk about it?
Did he hurt you or something?

09:22.528 --> 09:25.623
- Was this like a date rape-
- No! It was nothing like that.

09:25.698 --> 09:30.226
I was just upset about Max, and Kyle was there
for me, and we were close at one point...

09:30.303 --> 09:32.670
and one thingjust
led to another, and we-

09:33.839 --> 09:36.001

Max- No-
Future Max tells me...

13:53.833 --> 13:57.701
that the reason that the world comes
to an end is because- [Chuckles]

13:57.770 --> 14:02.298
Get this- he and Tess weren't together
when their enemies came to Earth.

14:02.374 --> 14:06.368
And the reason that they weren't together
is because Max and I got married.

14:06.445 --> 14:09.039
- Oh.
- I know. It's really confusing.

14:09.114 --> 14:12.277

- Future Max tells me...

14:16.355 --> 14:19.814
- So you slept with Kyle.
- No. No. Not really.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.418
I arranged it so Max saw
Kyle and I in bed together...

14:22.494 --> 14:24.428
but nothing really happened.

14:24.496 --> 14:26.726
So Max thinks
that you and Kyle-

- I'm sorry I lied to you.
- No, I'm so sorry that I got so mad.

14:33.205 --> 14:37.642

15:43.773 --> 15:46.674
- Home.
- Bingo.

15:46.743 --> 15:49.735
That's how the emissary

stenciled on your brain.

15:52.782 --> 15:57.310
And these other four worlds, they'll all be
sending a representative to the summit?

15:57.387 --> 16:00.413
They'll be doing the possession thing again,
like the emissary did.

16:00.490 --> 16:02.822
Why don't they come in person?

16:02.892 --> 16:06.556
You see, little girl,
space is what we call very, very big.

zip around the galaxy like on Star Trek.</i>

unless there's a good reason.

- We can go home?

16:16.606 --> 16:21.669
Yeah, we can, if the man here
cuts a deal at the summit.

16:23.346 --> 16:25.610
- What kind of a deal?
- A deal to bring peace back to our world.

16:25.682 --> 16:28.845
In our world-
blood on the streets, baby.

16:28.918 --> 16:31.717
That dude Kivar that took your throne-
people hate his ass.

16:31.788 --> 16:34.655
Our mother sent our pods
to Earth for safekeeping...

16:34.724 --> 16:36.852
hoping we'd
come back one day.

16:36.926 --> 16:40.055
And that day is now.
The word is that Kivar's desperate...

16:40.130 --> 16:42.064
and he'll do anything
to end the fighting.

16:42.132 --> 16:44.430
Including let us
come back home.

16:44.501 --> 16:48.062
- [Subway Rumbling]
- Home? I never thought-

16:49.773 --> 16:51.764
Not this soon.

16:53.343 --> 16:55.903
- What about Michael and Isabel?
- And Ava?

16:55.979 --> 16:58.311
They're expecting the royal four,
not the royal seven, yo.

16:58.381 --> 17:00.907
I am not leaving Michael
and Isabel behind.

17:00.984 --> 17:03.612
But, Max-

17:03.686 --> 17:09.284
Max, they seem so happy,
you know, in that cute little town.

17:09.358 --> 17:11.760
Chill. Chill.
It'll all be okay.

17:11.828 --> 17:15.127
You'll see.
<i>It'll</i> all fall our way.

17:15.198 --> 17:18.133
- Unless they bring up the granilith again.
- The granilith?

17:18.201 --> 17:21.068
<i>Yeah, yeah. It's this
stupid religious thing.</i>

17:21.137 --> 17:23.299
Our protector told us
it's like the Holy Grail.

17:23.373 --> 17:25.569
Some piece of junk people on our planet
worship for some reason.

17:25.642 --> 17:28.668
- You ever heard of it?
- No.

17:28.745 --> 17:31.680
- No.
- That's too bad.

17:33.049 --> 17:35.347
It would've been a nice
bargaining chip if you had.

17:36.553 --> 17:38.988
-I haven't.
- No problem.

17:39.055 --> 17:41.046
They probably won't
even bring it up anyway.

17:47.363 --> 17:49.525
<i>[Ava Screaming]</i>

17:50.533 --> 17:53.298

17:53.369 --> 17:55.360
Are you okay?

17:57.540 --> 18:01.534
L- I saw it.
And I watched it happen again.

18:01.611 --> 18:03.602
What? What?

18:03.680 --> 18:07.878
Zan. The accident.

18:07.951 --> 18:11.444
- The way his bodyjust lay there in the street.
- No. Shh.

18:11.521 --> 18:14.081
It's- Shh. It's okay.
lt'sjust a dream.

18:14.157 --> 18:17.058
Itwasjusta dream,
a bad dream.

18:17.126 --> 18:19.527
It's all my fault!

18:19.596 --> 18:22.531
I should have stopped it.

18:22.599 --> 18:25.500
I could have stopped it!

18:25.568 --> 18:29.527
- I should have known. I should have known.
- Known what? Known what?

18:31.107 --> 18:34.270
I can't talk about it.

18:36.412 --> 18:38.710
<i>[Ava ]
Zan was stubborn, strong.</i>

18:38.781 --> 18:42.513
<i>He'd put up a wall,
and you just couldn't get through.</i>

18:42.585 --> 18:45.782
He always tried to do
everything right, to be prefect.

18:45.855 --> 18:48.552
He was like that right up until-

18:49.559 --> 18:51.653
You must've loved him a lot.

18:52.729 --> 18:54.663
Yeah.

18:54.731 --> 18:57.223
I'm not sure he ever really
loved me back though.

18:57.300 --> 19:01.533
- Why?
-just a feeling.

19:01.604 --> 19:05.472
I always felt like he was waiting for
someone else to walk into his life.

19:07.443 --> 19:09.377
So what about you?

19:09.445 --> 19:11.573
How'd you
find out about Max?

19:11.648 --> 19:14.276
He just haul off
and drop the bomb one day?

19:14.350 --> 19:17.911
No. It was right over there.

19:19.689 --> 19:24.422
I was working, and, uh,
he was sitting at that booth.

19:24.494 --> 19:26.724
And someone
brought in a gun in...

19:26.796 --> 19:29.265
and it kind of went off,
and I got shot.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.530
I was dying,
but Max brought me back.

19:34.537 --> 19:37.802
- He brought you back?
- Yeah.

19:45.014 --> 19:47.574
- [ Isabel] Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

19:47.650 --> 19:50.210
Max, where are you?
Are you okay?

19:50.286 --> 19:52.482
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm still in New York.

19:52.555 --> 19:55.320
I just wanted to call and see
how everything was going.

19:57.327 --> 19:59.261
- So, how was Thanksgiving?
- It was great.

19:59.329 --> 20:02.731
Mom cried all the way from the
cranberry sauce to the peach cobbler.

20:02.799 --> 20:04.961
SO did I.

20:08.371 --> 20:12.103
Isabel, how would you feel
about going home?

20:12.175 --> 20:16.578
- When you say “home“-
- I mean, home.

20:18.114 --> 20:21.948
- Is that even possible?
- lfit is, do you wanna go or not?

20:22.018 --> 20:24.180
I don't know. I mean...

20:24.253 --> 20:26.449
leaving Mom and Dad
and Roswell...

20:26.522 --> 20:30.117
and for another planet,
it's- it seems crazy.

20:30.193 --> 20:33.754
- It sounds crazy.
- Well, it isn't.

20:33.830 --> 20:37.630
And I need an answer...
from you and Michael both.

20:37.700 --> 20:41.694
What? You can't-
You can't do this!

20:41.771 --> 20:43.705
You can't just drop this
on me all of a sudden.

20:43.773 --> 20:47.368
God, you just leave, without even
saying good-bye, with those people...

20:47.443 --> 20:49.377
without even discussing it
with Michael and I.

20:49.445 --> 20:52.642
- And now you expect me to- - I guess I'm
just being a self-indulgent little boy again.

20:52.715 --> 20:55.343
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

20:55.418 --> 20:57.682
I don't wanna rehash
the entire thing, Vilandra.

20:57.754 --> 21:02.624
- That's not fair. - Neither was letting
me hear the real story from Lonnie.

21:02.692 --> 21:08.290
- I'm sorry, Max.
- It's a little late for apologies, don't you think?

21:08.364 --> 21:10.298
You should've said that
the first time I confronted you.

21:11.601 --> 21:14.332
The first what?
What are you talking about?

21:14.404 --> 21:16.805
<i>I'll</i> call you when
the summit's over.

21:27.250 --> 21:30.515
- Why did Lonnie impersonate me?
- I don't know.

21:30.586 --> 21:32.645
- Why don't I believe you?
- That's your problem.

21:37.593 --> 21:39.994
Don't piss us off.

21:40.063 --> 21:42.532
Fine!
We'll do this the hard way.

21:42.598 --> 21:45.727
Okay, okay. Wait, wait.
It's okay.

21:45.802 --> 21:47.793
Come on, Ava.

21:51.507 --> 21:53.908
Look, Ava, you told me
that you had a secret...

21:53.976 --> 21:56.138
that you couldn't tell anyone.

21:56.212 --> 22:00.774
But, urn, if Max is in danger,
you have to tell us.

22:00.850 --> 22:03.342
You lost Zan.

22:03.419 --> 22:05.751
Please don't let me
lose Max.

22:05.822 --> 22:07.756
I love him,you know?

22:07.824 --> 22:10.953
I love him just as much
as you did Zan.

22:12.161 --> 22:15.426
Please, Ava,
don't let me lose him.

22:15.498 --> 22:17.830
<i>Please!</i>

- Is someone talkin' to you, retard?

22:44.560 --> 22:48.690
All right. That's it. Let's get
something clear right here, right now.

22:48.764 --> 22:51.062
I'm the one who passed
the emissary's test...

22:51.134 --> 22:54.263
and that means from now on,
I'm the one in charge here.

22:55.738 --> 22:58.799
Understood, duke.
You're the king.

22:58.875 --> 23:02.368
And for your information,
her name is Tess.

23:02.445 --> 23:05.278
<i>Rath, take Tess
and go inside.</i>

23:05.348 --> 23:07.282

to Max for a minute.

23:07.350 --> 23:09.341
Come on.

23:20.563 --> 23:22.497
I'm proud of you, Max.

23:22.565 --> 23:24.966
You're everything I loved
about Zan and more.

23:26.135 --> 23:28.126
You're the brother
I never knew.

23:50.760 --> 23:55.493
- Brody?
- Actually, my name is Larek.

23:55.565 --> 23:59.661
- Are you Zan?
- They tell me that used to be my name.

23:59.735 --> 24:02.261
But my name is Max,
Max Evans.

24:02.338 --> 24:06.468
If he doesn't even know who he is,
how can he sit in conference with us?

24:06.542 --> 24:10.172
He sits with us because
the emissary certified him.

24:10.246 --> 24:15.082
Kathana, Sero, Hanar and I
will represent each of our worlds.

24:15.151 --> 24:17.779
Max will speak for his.

24:17.853 --> 24:23.087
Actually, Kivar speaks for his world,
and I speak for Kivar.

24:24.594 --> 24:26.585
Max...

24:27.997 --> 24:30.056
nice to see your
genocidal girlfriend again.

24:31.467 --> 24:34.437
- Killed anyone today?
- Day's not over.

24:34.503 --> 24:37.268
- What a charmer.
- Can we begin?

24:37.340 --> 24:39.900
You know him?

24:39.976 --> 24:43.913
Long story.
He was in Roswell.

24:43.980 --> 24:46.415
Be careful.

24:46.482 --> 24:48.576
That much I know.

24:48.651 --> 24:50.585
<i>[ Isabel]
We've gotta find a way to warn Max.</i>

24:50.653 --> 24:52.382
He's in the middle
of the summit right now.

24:52.455 --> 24:55.117
- Where's the summit being held?
- Some building downtown.

24:55.191 --> 24:57.455
- You gotta do better than that.
- I don't know anything more.

24:57.526 --> 25:00.518
Hey, Isabel,
can't you dreamwalk Max?

25:00.596 --> 25:02.963
Put a warning in his mind?
You've done it before...

25:03.032 --> 25:04.966
<i>you know, when he
was in the white room.</i>

25:05.034 --> 25:06.968
That was different.
He was drugged.

25:07.036 --> 25:10.768
I was only a few miles away.
He's across the country now.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.831
I think we're out
of alternatives.

25:14.710 --> 25:18.544
We're here in the spirit
of reconciliation.

25:18.614 --> 25:22.073
We're not here to rehash the past,
point fingers and assign blame.

25:22.151 --> 25:26.110
Can we get to it?
We're here to end 5O years...

25:26.188 --> 25:28.850
<i>of misery and suffering
among our worlds.</i>

25:28.924 --> 25:34.090
<i>Kathana attacks Knzar,
Kwar attacks Sena, Sew attacks me'.!</i>

25:34.163 --> 25:36.257
The situation is intolerable!

25:36.332 --> 25:40.166
Agreed. We have to
find a solution.

25:45.274 --> 25:47.470
And Kivar has a solution.

25:47.543 --> 25:50.604
<i>Kivar will abdicate the throne
and allow the royal four...</i>

25:50.680 --> 25:53.274
<i>to return home
under the following conditions.</i>

25:54.417 --> 25:57.546
One: Max becomes king
only in name.

25:57.620 --> 26:01.284
<i>All real power in government
remains in Kivafis hands.</i>

26:01.357 --> 26:04.327
<i>Two: Max calls upon his followers
to lay down their weapons...</i>

26:04.393 --> 26:06.760
<i>and support
the new governments.</i>

26:06.829 --> 26:12.199
<i>And three, most importantly:
Max returns the granilith to us.</i>

26:12.268 --> 26:16.364
<i>- The granmkh?
- [ Nicholas] No, it's no longer on our worlds.</i>

26:16.439 --> 26:18.305
Yes, we've known about it
for a long time.

26:18.374 --> 26:21.241
<i>No, K I var decided
he didn't need to tell you.</i>

26:21.310 --> 26:24.678
And, yes, we know where it is.
It's with Max.

26:27.183 --> 26:29.481
Is this true, Max?

26:31.787 --> 26:33.721
- It's here.
- What?

26:36.559 --> 26:39.654
<i>[ Nicholas ] So there you have it.
Max comes home with the granilith...</i>

26:39.729 --> 26:42.061
<i>all is forgiven.</i>

26:42.131 --> 26:44.065
Do we have a deal?

26:46.936 --> 26:49.200
I need to think about this.

26:49.271 --> 26:53.105
I'd be surprised if you didn't.
But be quick about it.

26:53.175 --> 26:55.405
<i>Holding onto these bodies
isn't easy.</i>

26:55.478 --> 26:59.039
<i>In fact, it's chewing up
huge amounts of our resources.</i>

26:59.115 --> 27:01.413
Twenty minutes, Max,
then I need an answer.

27:04.286 --> 27:06.345
You'll have it.

27:16.198 --> 27:18.189
<i>Cut a deal with Nicholas?</i>

27:20.302 --> 27:22.293
I don't trust him any farther
than I can throw him.

27:22.371 --> 27:24.806
You could throw him pretty far.

27:24.874 --> 27:26.865
Then there's Lonnie and Rath.

27:28.511 --> 27:32.311
It's hard to believe they have the same
D.N.A. of Michael and Isabel.

27:32.381 --> 27:35.510
For what it's worth,
I don't trust them.

27:37.119 --> 27:39.918
And then there's this whole thing
about the granilith.

27:39.989 --> 27:43.254
Why did you lie to Lonnie and Rath
about the granilith anyway?

27:45.628 --> 27:47.892
There was something Liz said...

27:47.963 --> 27:50.694
just before we left.

27:50.766 --> 27:54.930
She told me the granilith could be dangerous
if it fell into the wrong hands.

27:55.004 --> 27:56.938
How does she know that?

27:57.006 --> 27:59.236
She wouldn't say.

27:59.308 --> 28:01.242
But she's never
even seen the granilith.

28:01.310 --> 28:04.041
-I know. I know.
- <i>[</i> Horn Honk/mg]

28:05.347 --> 28:07.406
But I just keep
thinking about it.

28:08.884 --> 28:12.878
The way she said it-
She seemed so sure.

28:16.759 --> 28:19.524
I just don't know
what to do.

28:19.595 --> 28:23.691
Whatever you do,
it'll be the right choice.

28:23.766 --> 28:27.361
- I'm sure of it.
- Why?

28:27.436 --> 28:30.872
Because despite whatever
Nicholas said about you in there...

28:30.940 --> 28:34.171
I know that you were a great man
in that other life...

28:34.243 --> 28:36.712
a great king.

28:36.779 --> 28:38.713
I know it in my bones.

28:41.817 --> 28:45.276
All you've ever done
is trust me...

28:45.354 --> 28:48.051
<i>been there for me
whenever I needed you.</i>

28:48.123 --> 28:51.024
I've never done anything
to deserve that kind of loyalty.

28:51.093 --> 28:53.687
I think in that other life...

28:54.730 --> 28:57.700
you must have been
one great husband.

28:59.635 --> 29:02.161

29:04.940 --> 29:06.999
<i>God, Ihate this town.</i>

29:14.116 --> 29:16.107

29:20.623 --> 29:23.718

29:23.792 --> 29:26.853

- Always.

29:26.929 --> 29:29.330
I can't wait
to see more of you.

29:29.398 --> 29:32.026
That'll have to wait
until we get home.

29:32.101 --> 29:36.504
Let's be clear, Lonnie. You don't
get home unless I get the granilith.

29:36.505 --> 29:36.528
Let's be clear, Lonnie. You don't
get home unless I get the granilith.

29:36.638 --> 29:38.970
Let me be clear, Nicholas.

29:39.040 --> 29:42.203
I don't give a damn whether or not
you get the granilith. I'm going home.

29:43.812 --> 29:46.338
Big talk for a woman
with no cards to play.

29:46.414 --> 29:48.348
I got cards.

29:48.416 --> 29:50.475
I just haven't
shown them to you yet.

29:51.953 --> 29:55.218
