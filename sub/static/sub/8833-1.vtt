00:00.432 --> 00:02.833
<i>Fate has chosen you, Leonardo.</i>

00:03.217 --> 00:05.919
I will follow you
to the ends of the earth

00:05.986 --> 00:07.754
to retrieve what's mine.

00:07.821 --> 00:09.222
You have to make
a decision.

00:09.290 --> 00:12.225
The Book Of Leaves or whoever
tears you away, not both.

00:12.293 --> 00:16.462
The Book contains secrets
of the Divine.

00:16.530 --> 00:18.431
<i>Whoever lays their hands</i>
<i>on the Book Of Leaves</i>

00:18.499 --> 00:19.899
<i>will rule the world.</i>

00:19.967 --> 00:24.938
Here is the secret
to deciphering them.

00:25.005 --> 00:27.240
I believe there may be
a spy in my court.

00:27.308 --> 00:31.744
Lucrezia Donati has Da Vinci
tied up between her thighs.

00:31.812 --> 00:34.213
You are Lucrezia Donati's
father?

00:34.281 --> 00:36.182
<i>The Pazzis</i>
<i>are moving on Florence.</i>

00:36.250 --> 00:37.016
<i>They want to kill Lorenzo.</i>

00:37.084 --> 00:38.818
You shared secrets
with Riario

00:38.886 --> 00:40.887
and put the entire city
at peril!

00:40.955 --> 00:42.789
This is your work!

00:42.856 --> 00:44.157
They're weak,
Your Holiness.

00:44.224 --> 00:46.359
This is your chance
to strike.

00:46.427 --> 00:48.061
The Pazzi conspire
against us.

00:48.128 --> 00:49.729
They're in league
with Rome!

00:49.797 --> 00:51.364
Death to the Medicis!

00:53.033 --> 00:56.102
<i>Your true loyalty is</i>
<i>to the Medicis, Captain.</i>

00:56.170 --> 00:58.504
I suggest you leave
this one to me.

00:58.572 --> 01:02.442
I'm bearing your child,
your son, Giuliano.

01:02.509 --> 01:05.144
Help your family.
Rome is my family!

01:09.049 --> 01:10.083
<i>Da Vinci!</i>

01:11.819 --> 01:12.952
I wonder which
of the two men you fuck

01:13.020 --> 01:14.654
will be buried
alongside you!

01:14.722 --> 01:16.122
I know this ring.

01:17.491 --> 01:19.459
If we survive this,

01:19.526 --> 01:20.793
I'll kill you both!

<i>Did you ever think</i>
<i>we'd see the end together?</i>

02:49.716 --> 02:54.020
I never believed that I would be
facing an end at all.

02:55.556 --> 02:58.391
God is laughing at us,
Da Vinci.

03:00.194 --> 03:03.096
This is not our fate.

03:22.583 --> 03:25.184
<i>One way or another,</i>

03:25.252 --> 03:28.154
<i>this is every man's fate.</i>

03:30.257 --> 03:34.694
Our lives are made
by the deaths of others.

03:34.761 --> 03:37.563
You were very quick
to surrender.

03:37.631 --> 03:39.732
<i>After all we've seen...</i>

03:42.336 --> 03:43.569
lost,

03:47.541 --> 03:49.675
perhaps you're naive
to endure.

03:49.743 --> 03:52.378
There is a greater
story here,

03:55.349 --> 03:57.416
still being written.

03:58.852 --> 04:00.686
By whom?

04:54.408 --> 04:55.808
Well...

04:55.876 --> 04:59.011
we both wanted
to see what's next.

05:01.515 --> 05:03.015
There's still time.

05:44.691 --> 05:47.593
God's vengeance is upon you!

05:57.604 --> 05:59.572
It's over, Lorenzo!
Da Vinci!

05:59.640 --> 06:02.708
The House of Medici
falls today!

06:02.776 --> 06:06.212
The windows are all intact.
Where are they?

06:09.816 --> 06:11.917
Beneath us.

06:22.529 --> 06:24.497
You betrayed me,
Da Vinci.

06:24.564 --> 06:26.532
I will see you
dead for it.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.101
If we escape,
I promise you

06:29.169 --> 06:31.103
every opportunity
to settle the score.

06:31.171 --> 06:33.139
But for now,
Your Magnificence,

06:33.206 --> 06:35.474
please just
shut the fuck up!

06:35.542 --> 06:38.210
Station men at every gate.

06:38.278 --> 06:40.880
Have reinforcements in
the trees, here and here.

06:40.947 --> 06:43.983
Stand ready to march on my
signal and no one else's.

06:44.051 --> 06:45.985
Understood?

06:46.053 --> 06:50.389
Gentlemen, I give you Florence -
a jewel beyond price,

06:50.457 --> 06:52.358
which will be ours
before nightfall.

06:53.460 --> 06:54.794
<i>We're wasting time,</i>

06:54.861 --> 06:57.229
<i>we should summon</i>
<i>Duke Frederico's army now.</i>

06:57.297 --> 06:59.265
<i>Florence is ours</i>
<i>for the taking!</i>

06:59.333 --> 07:01.167
And I say it is not.

07:01.234 --> 07:03.669
If Lorenzo is still alive, he
might yet rally his people.

07:03.737 --> 07:06.605
Lorenzo's dead, or bleeding
to death in the sewers.

07:06.673 --> 07:08.641
I cut his throat myself.

07:08.709 --> 07:11.143
Until he's proven dead,
we have nothing.

07:11.211 --> 07:14.347
The people need
to see a corpse.

07:14.414 --> 07:16.349
Captain Grunwald,
ride to Duke Frederico

07:16.416 --> 07:18.384
and make sure that hulking
cyclops sticks to the plan.

07:18.452 --> 07:20.753
He cannot invade
before our signal.

07:20.821 --> 07:23.322
Take her with you
and I will bring Da Vinci!

07:23.390 --> 07:26.092
Give me a lantern.

07:26.159 --> 07:27.993
Follow me, you fools!

07:47.514 --> 07:49.315
Da Vinci!

07:57.357 --> 07:59.425
There's smoke rising
from the Duomo.

07:59.493 --> 08:02.361
Has all of Florence
gone insane?

08:03.730 --> 08:05.698
We should go back.
No.

08:05.766 --> 08:08.000
I say we go on.

08:09.403 --> 08:11.303
Leo was desperate
to board the Basilisk.

08:11.371 --> 08:13.451
If we take this barge to Pisa,
we can stall it there.

08:13.507 --> 08:16.675
What about the Maestro?
He'll meet us before she sails.

08:16.743 --> 08:18.711
You sure?
Fuck, no!

08:18.779 --> 08:20.646
But delaying the Basilisk
is all we can manage.

08:23.250 --> 08:26.051
Let's find that dog's breath
who'll take us to Pisa.

08:32.491 --> 08:36.261
People are fleeing
the city in fear.

08:36.328 --> 08:40.566
Clarice and her brood
scurry for home, time to close the fist.

08:40.634 --> 08:43.135
I'll lead the mob against
the Medici palace.

08:43.203 --> 08:46.672
Find Giustini and hunt down
any Medici loyalists.

08:54.514 --> 08:56.782
Move!

08:56.850 --> 08:58.818
<i>I need a defensive line</i>
<i>for the palace gate.</i>

08:58.885 --> 09:00.853
The barriers must be higher.

09:00.921 --> 09:03.088
We need more men.
We have none.

09:03.156 --> 09:05.691
Find some fucking men!

09:09.496 --> 09:11.330
They should be back by now.

09:21.575 --> 09:23.542
We have to go back
for my husband.

09:23.610 --> 09:25.110
Quattrone will look
after him.

09:25.178 --> 09:26.658
<i>See what happens</i>
<i>to friends of Medici!</i>

09:28.515 --> 09:29.648
Medici!

09:29.716 --> 09:33.219
Gut the captain
and the Medici bitches!

09:35.589 --> 09:36.722
Go to the palace!

09:40.427 --> 09:42.828
Come with me.
I'll deal with this!

09:59.679 --> 10:02.648
Death to the Medici!

10:10.390 --> 10:12.057
Hurry!

10:13.159 --> 10:14.560
Quickly, follow me.

10:14.628 --> 10:16.495
Girls, stay with me.

10:18.865 --> 10:23.435
Florence is no place
for the godless!

10:24.671 --> 10:26.171
Stay with me.

10:31.511 --> 10:34.480
Girls, stay with me.

10:35.682 --> 10:38.417
Death to the Medici whore!

10:52.032 --> 10:54.266
Where's Maddalena?

10:54.334 --> 10:57.469
Maria, where's Maddalena?

10:59.205 --> 11:01.307
Maddalena?

11:01.374 --> 11:02.641
Maddalena!

11:02.709 --> 11:04.777
Mother?

11:07.847 --> 11:10.049
Mother?

11:15.188 --> 11:17.056
Aargh!

11:27.367 --> 11:28.734
Open the door!

11:36.509 --> 11:38.477
Please, let me through!

11:38.545 --> 11:41.080
Mother!

11:55.762 --> 11:57.730
Please!

12:08.541 --> 12:11.010
Open the door!

12:20.387 --> 12:23.522
Hold the doors!
They must not pass!

12:25.291 --> 12:26.451
Come along, girls, follow me.

12:30.897 --> 12:32.297
There you are.

12:33.633 --> 12:35.601
Take the children
to Lorenzo's quarters.

12:35.669 --> 12:38.303
You will allow no one in
to see them save myself.

12:40.573 --> 12:43.575
Maria, I need you to be strong
for your sisters, do you understand?

12:43.643 --> 12:47.146
Your father will be
home soon. Now go.

12:47.213 --> 12:49.148
Gualberto, see to it.

12:49.215 --> 12:51.250
This way.

12:54.754 --> 12:55.888
Fabrizio?

12:55.955 --> 12:57.489
<i>Follow me.</i>

13:05.298 --> 13:07.266
Stay close
to the children.

13:07.333 --> 13:10.202
If the palazzo
is breached,

13:10.270 --> 13:13.906
I trust you
to do the right thing.

13:15.108 --> 13:16.241
Mix it with honey.

13:16.309 --> 13:19.378
A teaspoon apiece
should be sufficient.

13:19.446 --> 13:22.948
My lady, I cannot.

13:23.016 --> 13:24.283
Do you know what will
happen to them

13:24.350 --> 13:25.884
if the Pazzis
enter these walls?

13:28.321 --> 13:31.356
Can I trust you or not?

13:33.159 --> 13:34.326
Of course.

13:52.445 --> 13:54.046
Fall back inside the gates!

13:54.114 --> 13:56.048
Listen to my orders!

13:56.116 --> 13:58.050
Get back!

14:12.265 --> 14:13.766
Da Vinci?

14:13.833 --> 14:16.335
You're finished!

14:20.907 --> 14:22.474
Come on.

14:22.542 --> 14:23.509
Come on!

14:27.447 --> 14:30.549
Just leave me here to die,
Da Vinci.

14:30.617 --> 14:33.018
And leave me to fix Florence
on my own?

14:33.086 --> 14:37.489
Now that I've glimpsed
the gears that lie beneath the face...

14:37.557 --> 14:39.391
What?

14:39.459 --> 14:43.195
You didn't just use Lucrezia
to get close to me.

14:44.831 --> 14:47.900
You manipulated us all.

14:49.335 --> 14:51.603
<i>Da Vinci?</i>

14:52.739 --> 14:55.574
<i>Da Vinci!</i>

14:55.642 --> 14:56.742
Come on!

15:09.055 --> 15:10.756
Well?
Nothing.

15:10.824 --> 15:12.324
Stand still.

15:15.495 --> 15:17.462
They were here.

15:17.530 --> 15:20.098
He's dragging a body.

15:20.166 --> 15:23.001
Maybe you truly did
kill Lorenzo.

15:24.971 --> 15:26.271
That's it.

15:47.794 --> 15:50.462
By God's blood,
I can't go on.

15:57.036 --> 15:59.304
There might be
a way out of this.

16:00.340 --> 16:02.474
I just need you
to play dead.

16:03.776 --> 16:04.776
I am dead.

16:06.379 --> 16:07.896
Signor Da Vinci?

16:07.921 --> 16:10.282
You took your time
scurrying back here.

16:10.283 --> 16:13.318
Forgive me, I had my own family...
Where's Lorenzo?

16:13.386 --> 16:15.354
No one knows.

16:15.421 --> 16:17.389
Assemble every man
we have.

16:17.457 --> 16:19.892
Lorenzo must be found.

16:19.959 --> 16:23.295
With respect, surely Lorenzo
would never leave his property,

16:23.363 --> 16:25.330
his children,
undefended?

16:25.398 --> 16:27.599
What do you suggest?

16:34.040 --> 16:35.574
There he is.

16:35.642 --> 16:38.777
<i>I told you I'd killed him.</i>

16:38.845 --> 16:41.513
The artista has
abandoned his corpse.

16:43.116 --> 16:46.118
I'll prepare to signal Duke Frederico.
Do it.

16:46.185 --> 16:49.154
I'll finish the job
and decapitate him.

16:58.765 --> 17:02.034
It seems finishing the job has
fallen to me.

17:02.101 --> 17:04.069
You really must
surrender now.

17:04.137 --> 17:07.339
The Medicis are finished.

17:07.406 --> 17:10.008
You must not throw your life
away for Lorenzo.

17:10.076 --> 17:12.044
If Rome takes Florence...

17:12.111 --> 17:15.213
you'll understand.

17:15.281 --> 17:17.883
I have nothing to lose.

17:17.951 --> 17:22.220
Well, either way, you'll have
one blast to kill us all.

17:22.288 --> 17:24.790
Aim well.

17:24.857 --> 17:26.325
Oh, I will.

17:30.063 --> 17:32.197
50 florins to the man
who takes him.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.067
100 florins!

17:59.926 --> 18:02.961
Your vendetta against Da Vinci
blinds you. Forget him.

18:03.029 --> 18:05.263
We must move on
the Palazzo Medici.

18:09.135 --> 18:11.837
Gather your men, then,
Francesco.

18:11.904 --> 18:14.673
I will speak to
Duke Frederico.

18:18.511 --> 18:20.679
How many weapons do we have?

18:20.747 --> 18:23.281
Backswords and boar spears,
boiling oil...

18:23.349 --> 18:25.717
It's not weapons,
it's men that we lack.

18:25.785 --> 18:27.753
Still no sign
of Quattrone.

18:27.820 --> 18:29.788
I just hope
he's with Lorenzo.

18:29.856 --> 18:32.924
Arm the maids, the servants,
anyone who can carry a weapon.

18:32.992 --> 18:34.960
Enzo says you're
a tolerable shot.

18:35.028 --> 18:36.995
Take the longbows
and position yourselves

18:37.063 --> 18:39.531
in the windows
above the gates. Go!

18:45.438 --> 18:48.040
<i>Once the oil is boiling,</i>
<i>ready another cauldron.</i>

18:50.143 --> 18:52.744
Capitano, a word.

18:54.447 --> 18:58.483
Outside the Duomo,
Riario said your true loyalty was to us,

18:58.551 --> 19:01.219
implying that it had
once been otherwise.

19:01.287 --> 19:03.822
Did you know
of this attack?

19:05.825 --> 19:07.426
My husband would have
had you killed

19:07.493 --> 19:09.227
just for that
hesitation.

19:09.295 --> 19:11.263
My allegiance wavered,
signora.

19:11.330 --> 19:13.298
When it did,
Rome sought to buy it.

19:13.366 --> 19:16.168
But now I fear that
Rome itself has strayed.

19:16.235 --> 19:18.070
I have news for you,
Captain.

19:18.137 --> 19:21.573
The Eternal City
strayed some time ago.

19:23.042 --> 19:26.044
I am in your debt
for the life of my child.

19:26.112 --> 19:27.879
But if you betray
the Medici family again,

19:27.947 --> 19:30.949
I will have you gutted
like a pig.

19:35.822 --> 19:37.789
Who else was involved?

19:37.857 --> 19:39.825
The Pazzis,
Bernardo Baroncelli,

19:39.892 --> 19:42.861
Giustini, Battista,
Fathers Matthei and Bagnone...

19:42.929 --> 19:44.429
My brother?

19:44.497 --> 19:47.332
Cardinal Orsini was the one
who first approached me.

19:52.371 --> 19:54.506
Then the moment
the palazzo is secure

19:54.574 --> 19:55.807
and my husband
is safe,

19:55.875 --> 19:58.443
I want you to seek out
the Cardinal, understood?

19:58.511 --> 20:00.779
Securing his safety
would be prudent.

20:00.847 --> 20:02.380
Fuck prudence!

20:02.448 --> 20:07.419
I want my brother rotting
in the Bargello by nightfall.

20:08.788 --> 20:10.655
Look at us!

20:10.723 --> 20:12.023
Blood on our vestments!

20:12.091 --> 20:14.359
The carnage we permitted
in the House of the Lord!

20:16.062 --> 20:18.630
Heavenly Father, I know
we have fallen short of your glory.

20:18.698 --> 20:21.700
Our sins are ever before you.
Wash me from iniquity.

20:21.767 --> 20:24.035
Create in me a clean...

20:24.103 --> 20:25.437
Take hold of yourself!

20:25.505 --> 20:27.772
The people need a cardinal's
voice, not a coward's!

20:27.840 --> 20:29.808
My sister Clarice
survived your knives!

20:29.876 --> 20:32.277
She knows
of my complicity now!

20:32.345 --> 20:35.113
Liberty!

20:35.882 --> 20:37.682
Liberty!

20:37.750 --> 20:39.684
Liberty!

20:56.269 --> 20:58.637
Liberty!

21:03.276 --> 21:05.310
Liberty!

21:11.117 --> 21:13.552
Death to them!

21:14.287 --> 21:15.954
<i>Uncle! Uncle!</i>

21:28.167 --> 21:30.101
Let the maggots burn!

21:34.507 --> 21:36.808
Aaargh!

21:52.325 --> 21:53.725
Aaargh!

21:53.793 --> 21:55.393
Leo!

21:55.461 --> 21:58.029
I could have killed you.

21:58.097 --> 22:00.432
I... I...

22:17.149 --> 22:19.117
My dear Count.

22:19.185 --> 22:21.987
Your charming agent
was just regaling us

22:22.054 --> 22:24.823
with details
of your folly.

22:24.890 --> 22:27.192
So Lorenzo still lives?

22:27.260 --> 22:30.195
Finally ready to put
an end to this madness

22:30.263 --> 22:32.030
and send my men
to take the city.

22:32.098 --> 22:33.465
The uprising has
to appear to have

22:33.532 --> 22:34.733
been motivated
from within,

22:34.800 --> 22:36.901
so we allowed the Pazzi family
to take the lead.

22:36.969 --> 22:39.938
<i>You will stick to the plan</i>
<i>and wait for our signal.</i>

22:40.006 --> 22:42.307
It doesn't take
two eyes to see

22:42.375 --> 22:44.335
what a dog's breakfast
you've made of this affair.

22:44.343 --> 22:46.378
According to Signora Donati,

22:46.445 --> 22:48.380
the problem is
you're more preoccupied

22:48.447 --> 22:51.750
with finding Da Vinci
than securing Florence.

22:53.786 --> 22:57.055
Da Vinci stole something
of incalculable value

22:57.123 --> 22:59.357
which the Holy Father has
entrusted me with retrieving.

22:59.425 --> 23:02.861
More valuable
than Florence?

23:02.928 --> 23:05.597
A key...
One of two.

23:05.665 --> 23:09.868
which will unlock a treasure
worth 1,000 cities.

23:09.935 --> 23:14.406
<i>Da Vinci has them</i>
<i>both now.</i>

23:14.473 --> 23:18.376
And I believe some
knowledge I desire.

23:18.444 --> 23:20.111
Excuse me.

23:22.114 --> 23:24.582
Aagh!

23:28.788 --> 23:31.423
Where is the Vault of Heaven?

23:31.490 --> 23:33.725
I've got no idea,
he didn't say.

23:33.793 --> 23:37.962
No, but he... he did reveal
something, didn't he?

23:38.030 --> 23:38.963
I can see it in your eyes,

23:39.031 --> 23:41.533
an indication
of where he's heading.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.902
Give her to me. It'll be
a pleasure to make her talk.

23:43.969 --> 23:47.038
No, no, that won't be necessary.

23:47.106 --> 23:51.276
Signora Donati knows very well
what I'm capable of.

24:06.926 --> 24:09.127
Perhaps you'd like
to honor your new friend

24:09.195 --> 24:12.464
with a small gift
of a personal nature.

24:13.899 --> 24:16.835
An eye for an eye,
so to speak.

24:16.902 --> 24:19.671
Wait, wait!

24:20.773 --> 24:24.209
For what?

24:24.276 --> 24:26.111
He's headed to Pisa.

24:26.178 --> 24:28.413
He's boarding a ship.

24:28.481 --> 24:29.914
What's the name
of the ship?

24:29.982 --> 24:31.950
Tell me the name
of the ship.

24:32.017 --> 24:35.220
What was the name
of the fucking ship?

24:35.287 --> 24:37.989
The name of the ship?

24:38.057 --> 24:40.692
The Basilisk.

24:44.029 --> 24:45.864
The Basilisk?

24:50.403 --> 24:54.406
We ride for Pisa immediately.
You will come with us.

24:54.473 --> 24:57.375
If you are lying, I will make
your father pay in blood.

24:57.443 --> 25:00.779
<i>Your Grace?</i>

25:00.846 --> 25:05.250
Are you sure Pisa takes
precedence right now?

25:09.321 --> 25:10.655
Da Vinci has the keys,
Lupo.

25:10.723 --> 25:12.690
If he reaches
the Vault of Heaven,

25:12.758 --> 25:15.160
the Book Of Leaves
is his to claim.

25:15.227 --> 25:17.328
<i>I want to know its secrets</i>
<i>as much as you do.</i>

25:17.396 --> 25:21.566
But the Holy Father was clear -
secure Florence first.

25:23.068 --> 25:25.036
Gather your men,
Captain.

25:25.104 --> 25:27.071
We're leaving.

25:27.139 --> 25:29.674
The Holy Father
fills our coffers, not you.

25:29.742 --> 25:32.877
Florence must come first.

25:32.945 --> 25:35.513
Lupo?

25:36.849 --> 25:37.949
I'm sorry.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.821
<i>I tell you what.</i>

25:42.888 --> 25:44.856
If you want to chase phantoms

25:44.924 --> 25:47.959
and leave the fortunes
of Florence to us, go.

25:48.027 --> 25:50.428
I'll even give you some trusted
men to accompany you.

25:50.496 --> 25:53.364
And provisions
for the journey.

25:53.432 --> 25:55.400
Why would you possibly
do that?

25:55.468 --> 25:58.436
'Cause I don't like you.

25:58.504 --> 26:00.505
And I'm quite happy
to see you

26:00.573 --> 26:03.041
sail off the edge
of the world.

26:03.108 --> 26:07.111
But if you somehow achieve
your aims and return,

26:07.179 --> 26:11.483
well, you'll owe me,
won't you?

26:14.920 --> 26:17.021
Very well.

26:17.089 --> 26:19.591
I accept your offer.

26:21.494 --> 26:23.428
Of course you do!

26:32.238 --> 26:38.409
<i>You, Leonardo, must book</i>
<i>a passage on that ship.</i>

26:38.477 --> 26:43.214
<i>The Book Of Leaves</i>
<i>of your mother's faith...</i>

26:43.282 --> 26:45.850
..will remain a mystery.

26:45.918 --> 26:49.320
The choice and
the consequences...

26:49.388 --> 26:51.990
are yours.

26:52.057 --> 26:54.025
Leo, you've been dreaming.

27:06.138 --> 27:07.338
What's going on?

27:07.406 --> 27:09.173
The city's in chaos.

27:09.241 --> 27:12.777
There are rumors the Pazzis
carry the day.

27:12.845 --> 27:14.245
Where's Lorenzo?

27:14.313 --> 27:15.613
He's downstairs.

27:18.817 --> 27:19.851
How is he?

27:19.919 --> 27:21.786
He's dying.

27:21.854 --> 27:23.221
I applied a poultice of
staunchweed and yarrow

27:23.289 --> 27:26.758
to stop the bleeding
but it hasn't helped.

27:26.825 --> 27:29.127
His wounds are far too
great for us to treat.

27:29.194 --> 27:32.163
And if he dies here, Leo,
the responsibility is ours.

27:32.231 --> 27:34.933
We need to convey His
Magnificence to the palace.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.135
Let his own physic attend
his final hours.

27:37.202 --> 27:38.836
There's no point.

27:38.904 --> 27:40.738
He's lost too much blood,
he won't survive the journey.

27:40.806 --> 27:44.375
What do you propose?
To be logical.

27:44.443 --> 27:47.178
Lorenzo's lost blood.

27:47.246 --> 27:50.682
He needs blood.

27:50.749 --> 27:53.651
I'm gonna give him
some of mine.

27:53.719 --> 27:55.887
Leo, you can't,
the Bible prohibits it!

27:55.955 --> 27:57.288
Leviticus is explicit.

27:57.356 --> 28:00.258
You are not to eat any blood,
either of bird or animal!

28:00.326 --> 28:01.693
Damn your superstitions, Andrea!

28:01.760 --> 28:04.195
We're not gonna
make him drink it!

28:04.263 --> 28:06.965
There's a folio in my loft,
top shelf, west wall.

28:07.032 --> 28:09.000
Beneath the boar's skull.

28:09.068 --> 28:11.970
Red cover, embossed
with an Islamic star.

28:12.972 --> 28:14.939
Ibn-al-Nafis.
What?

28:15.007 --> 28:19.277
Arab physician and scholar,
practiced in the 13th century.

28:19.345 --> 28:21.546
He disproved
Galen's assertion

28:21.614 --> 28:24.048
that blood moves
through invisible pores

28:24.116 --> 28:26.236
and argued that it travels
from the heart to the lungs

28:26.251 --> 28:30.154
through the veins
and arteries,

28:30.222 --> 28:34.025
just as the canals of Venice
bring provisions to the city.

28:34.093 --> 28:36.060
But they're running dry.

28:36.128 --> 28:38.763
So we need to
replenish them.

28:38.831 --> 28:42.367
I am gonna cut
into my arm,

28:44.436 --> 28:48.940
and transfer the blood
from my body into his.

28:49.008 --> 28:50.274
Here - Sharh Tashrih
al Qanoun.

28:50.342 --> 28:54.846
'Commentary on the Anatomy
of a Canon...'

28:54.913 --> 28:56.547
You see?

29:17.536 --> 29:19.704
Nafis made the same discoveries
I have.

29:19.772 --> 29:23.174
All those nights dissecting
corpses, Andrea.

29:23.242 --> 29:25.843
They're about to pay off.

29:32.184 --> 29:33.351
We searched his pockets.

29:54.073 --> 29:55.673
<i>Commander!</i>

29:55.741 --> 29:57.442
<i>Where is he?</i>

29:57.509 --> 30:00.845
My lady?
My husband.

30:00.913 --> 30:02.447
Has he not returned?

30:02.514 --> 30:05.817
He was with you.

30:05.884 --> 30:07.051
We were separated
during the attack.

30:07.119 --> 30:09.654
Lorenzo was wounded
but managed to escape.

30:09.722 --> 30:11.823
Escape where?

30:11.890 --> 30:15.326
When last I saw him, he fled
with the help of the artista Da Vinci.

30:15.394 --> 30:19.263
Then he's alive?

30:19.331 --> 30:20.965
Why are you here,
Commander?

30:21.033 --> 30:22.734
My men are exhausted,
trapped for hours by the mob.

30:22.801 --> 30:25.603
And Lorenzo is out
among them.

30:25.671 --> 30:28.573
Mount a search at once.
We barely survived our arrival.

30:28.640 --> 30:30.808
Your duty is his safety.

30:30.876 --> 30:33.578
My lady, you are not empowered
to give me orders.

30:33.645 --> 30:36.013
As a member of the Signoria,
the city...

30:36.081 --> 30:38.983
The city? Florence was
nothing before the Medicis.

30:39.051 --> 30:40.752
Now it is the jewel
of Europe.

30:40.819 --> 30:43.221
This city owes
everything to Lorenzo.

30:43.288 --> 30:45.823
Now go and find him,
or I will have your titles

30:45.891 --> 30:48.559
and your testicles removed.

31:03.709 --> 31:05.743
Lift.

31:09.081 --> 31:11.048
Hold him still.

31:11.116 --> 31:14.185
Aargh!
Hold him still, do it!

31:14.253 --> 31:16.220
You coward!

31:16.288 --> 31:18.256
You cowards,
I'll kill you all!

31:18.323 --> 31:20.491
I'll kill you all,
you cowards!

31:32.070 --> 31:34.038
Tincture of opium.

31:34.106 --> 31:36.874
It should keep him sedated.

31:36.942 --> 31:39.277
Everyone wash your hands.
Why?

31:39.344 --> 31:41.646
The Eastern scholars
believed ablution

31:41.713 --> 31:43.948
prevented contamination
as their faith.

31:44.016 --> 31:46.784
<i>Now who's superstitious?</i>
<i>Just do it, Andrea!</i>

31:46.852 --> 31:48.519
Grab me those clamps.

31:55.594 --> 31:58.930
What on earth is that?
Sheep's intestine.

31:58.997 --> 32:01.966
The Greeks used reeds for
cannulas, we use my pen nibs.

32:02.034 --> 32:04.569
There are other Medicis
to replace Lorenzo.

32:04.636 --> 32:07.572
But Florence only has
one Leonardo Da Vinci.

32:07.639 --> 32:10.741
Look what Florence has
become without Lorenzo.

32:10.809 --> 32:12.109
Come on!

32:12.177 --> 32:13.644
I was wrong.

32:13.712 --> 32:16.247
He believed in me
when no one else would,

32:16.315 --> 32:18.015
he entrusted me
with the city's defense.

32:18.083 --> 32:21.652
That's what I'm doing now.
Finish that.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.087
I'm defending Florence.

32:23.155 --> 32:25.957
I believe I can save him,
Andrea.

32:28.260 --> 32:30.695
I need you to believe it too.

32:32.831 --> 32:34.565
Pass me that knife.

32:42.274 --> 32:44.742
One, two, three...

32:44.810 --> 32:49.247
Argh!

32:49.314 --> 32:52.717
Now, open the median basilic on
Lorenzo's arm.

32:52.784 --> 32:54.784
It's anterior to the elbow,
just below the surface.

33:01.994 --> 33:03.127
What have I done?

33:04.129 --> 33:05.897
Clamp the intestines, Vanessa.

33:05.964 --> 33:08.299
What?
Clamp the intestine!

33:10.836 --> 33:15.439
Now, insert the other end
of the pen nib into Lorenzo's vein.

33:18.110 --> 33:21.512
Into the vein. Yes.

33:21.580 --> 33:24.181
Now release the clamp.

33:24.249 --> 33:28.419
Is it working?
Is the tube moving?

33:28.487 --> 33:29.820
No.

33:29.888 --> 33:32.256
Raise me up.

33:36.795 --> 33:38.930
Stop.

33:40.032 --> 33:41.999
How long do we let it
run its course?

33:42.067 --> 33:44.869
Till Lorenzo regains
his color and I lose mine.

33:49.875 --> 33:52.176
It's moving.

33:52.244 --> 33:56.314
<i>Our blood is being</i>
<i>transferred.</i>

34:06.291 --> 34:09.126
Leo...
<i>It's alright.</i>

34:09.194 --> 34:11.228
<i>It's alright, Andrea.</i>

34:14.065 --> 34:17.501
Time is a river,

34:17.569 --> 34:22.139
and the Turk has walked
upstream.

34:23.641 --> 34:28.746
He assured me
fate isn't done with me yet.

35:03.615 --> 35:04.882
There you are.

35:08.920 --> 35:10.888
I feared I'd lost you.

35:12.791 --> 35:14.658
Where am I?

35:23.568 --> 35:27.405
You're where you belong,
by my side.

35:33.645 --> 35:36.013
I pushed you away.

35:36.081 --> 35:39.050
I should never
have done that.

35:41.253 --> 35:43.721
I'm sorry.

35:43.789 --> 35:46.891
Why do you condemn yourself
to walk this path alone?

35:46.958 --> 35:50.861
I'm not alone.

35:50.929 --> 35:54.131
And my friends
are more loyal than most.

35:54.199 --> 35:56.867
They admire your mind.

35:56.935 --> 36:00.538
But who among them
truly knows you?

36:03.575 --> 36:06.610
Tell me this feels
anything less than perfect.

36:14.753 --> 36:18.222
What was that?

36:18.290 --> 36:20.224
This is how it happens.

36:32.704 --> 36:35.306
This is how you leave us.

36:45.684 --> 36:47.551
What do they want?

36:47.619 --> 36:52.022
They want what we all want,
Leonardo.

36:52.090 --> 36:55.259
They want you.

37:16.515 --> 37:19.049
This painting.

37:19.117 --> 37:22.486
It was my first glimpse
of Lorenzo.

37:22.554 --> 37:24.021
Viewed only after
our families

37:24.089 --> 37:27.658
had brokered
our marriage.

37:27.726 --> 37:30.494
I pray it's not the last sight
I have of him as well.

37:30.562 --> 37:34.198
I have become aware of Lorenzo's
current circumstance.

37:34.266 --> 37:36.934
It seems our hopes hang
on your first born.

37:37.002 --> 37:39.763
You can imagine how much
that thrills me.

37:39.863 --> 37:42.250
Signora, I would like to move
you and the children

37:42.275 --> 37:43.741
to a different part of the city.

37:43.742 --> 37:45.709
We have repelled the Pazzis,

37:45.777 --> 37:48.846
but without Lorenzo,
they will return.

37:51.016 --> 37:52.983
Gualberto.

37:53.051 --> 37:55.719
This man has brought
a message from Lorenzo.

37:55.787 --> 37:57.688
Is he safe?

38:03.228 --> 38:04.395
Agh!

38:33.792 --> 38:36.827
I'm only trying
to save Florence.

38:36.895 --> 38:37.895
So am I.

38:37.963 --> 38:39.296
Urgh!

38:43.735 --> 38:46.804
Signora, you must
leave tonight.

38:46.871 --> 38:50.574
The Medicis do not run,
Signor Da Vinci.

38:50.642 --> 38:54.211
We will fight
until our last breath.

39:10.595 --> 39:12.563
He still breathes.

39:12.631 --> 39:16.700
Faint...but still there.

39:16.768 --> 39:18.736
Damn you, Leo.

39:18.803 --> 39:22.373
There are limits
even for you.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.440
Maestro?

39:23.508 --> 39:25.809
Do you think Lorenzo
will recover?

39:25.877 --> 39:27.778
Truthfully?

39:27.846 --> 39:30.180
I have no idea,
this is all beyond me.

39:30.248 --> 39:33.717
What do you think
will happen if he,

39:33.785 --> 39:35.619
if he dies here with us?

39:35.687 --> 39:38.055
You mean if it's discovered that
we, and not the Pazzi,

39:38.123 --> 39:40.724
succeeded in killing
the ruler of Florence?

39:40.792 --> 39:42.760
I hesitate to hazard a guess.

39:42.827 --> 39:45.062
Would they hang a woman
who's with child?

39:45.130 --> 39:49.033
My dear... Vanessa, shh.

39:49.100 --> 39:51.602
Worse, what if the Pazzis
discover my condition?

39:51.670 --> 39:54.138
They'll hang me
in the piazza as a traitor!

39:54.205 --> 39:56.006
No, Vanessa...
They'll kill both of us.

39:56.074 --> 39:58.776
No, no one is going to harm you
or your child.

39:58.843 --> 40:00.811
Let us agree right now,

40:00.879 --> 40:03.714
the truth of his parentage
remains a secret.

40:06.618 --> 40:08.585
Are you alright?

40:11.923 --> 40:15.426
Andrea...
What?

40:16.294 --> 40:19.530
I'm seeing things.

40:50.695 --> 40:54.665
Something's happening to me,
Andrea.

40:57.502 --> 41:00.304
I think my soul...

41:01.573 --> 41:06.777
has be-- become unmoored.

41:06.845 --> 41:08.605
That's because you're drifting
towards death.

41:09.581 --> 41:11.648
That's enough.

41:11.716 --> 41:13.384
I'm putting a stop to this.

41:15.954 --> 41:17.755
No, no, please!

41:17.822 --> 41:19.857
Please, please.

41:24.696 --> 41:27.664
Not... Not until...

41:27.732 --> 41:30.033
Lorenzo's recov--

41:41.646 --> 41:44.581
I'm sorry, my boy.

41:44.649 --> 41:48.118
But there's already been
too much death this day.

42:04.736 --> 42:05.669
My lord?

42:05.737 --> 42:07.404
You are leaving Italy?

42:07.472 --> 42:11.341
If I can commandeer the Basilisk
in time, then, yes.

42:11.409 --> 42:13.377
I am here to take care
of your needs.

42:13.445 --> 42:15.813
Take me with you.

42:15.880 --> 42:19.683
I plan to sail an ocean, Zita,
to an unknown land.

42:19.751 --> 42:23.353
I may be forced
to do terrible things.

42:23.421 --> 42:26.390
I have done terrible things.
I don't care.

42:26.458 --> 42:29.293
Your place is in Rome.

42:30.995 --> 42:33.697
I serve you, my lord.

42:33.765 --> 42:37.835
The Holy Father
will simply use me, hurt me.

42:40.472 --> 42:44.208
Then I free you
from servitude.

42:44.275 --> 42:45.242
Speak to the quartermaster,

42:45.310 --> 42:47.344
he will provide you
with a horse.

42:47.412 --> 42:49.112
You can ride away
from all this.

42:49.180 --> 42:51.148
I am far from home,
my lord.

42:51.216 --> 42:55.319
In these lands,
a woman of my color alone,

42:55.386 --> 42:58.155
You killing me now would be more
merciful than freedom.

43:01.960 --> 43:04.661
Then--

43:04.729 --> 43:08.265
ready another horse
and follow.

43:35.820 --> 43:38.387
Believe it or not, I find it
less unnerving

43:38.412 --> 43:40.364
for you to just interrupt me,

43:40.365 --> 43:43.934
than for you to ling
like a vomitus stench.

43:46.371 --> 43:48.605
I come from Florence,
Your Holiness.

43:50.708 --> 43:52.676
With good news, I pray?

43:52.744 --> 43:56.313
Giuliano di Medici is dead.

43:56.381 --> 43:58.849
And his brother?
Wounded.

44:00.985 --> 44:04.121
I would have sent dogs
if I wanted him wounded.

44:04.188 --> 44:06.590
The Pazzis strive to
end the matter swiftly.

44:06.658 --> 44:10.127
And yet you are here,

44:10.194 --> 44:12.529
not by my nephew's side.

44:15.867 --> 44:20.170
Your nephew,
Count Riario is--

44:20.238 --> 44:22.205
he's no longer
in Florence.

44:22.273 --> 44:25.309
As we speak, he's embarking on
a journey across the sea,

44:25.376 --> 44:29.580
to pursue some
mysterious book.

44:29.647 --> 44:32.616
The Book Of Leaves.

44:33.918 --> 44:36.753
Yet another soul falls prey.

44:49.534 --> 44:52.469
Let's go, you laggards.
We haven't got all day.

44:52.537 --> 44:54.504
Oi, you two!

44:54.572 --> 44:56.373
The Captain's in aft cabin.

44:58.776 --> 45:01.378
Think we'll convince him to wait
for the Maestro?

45:01.446 --> 45:04.081
I once convinced a woman
I was the ghost of her late husband,

45:04.148 --> 45:06.149
back from the dead
to help her conceive.

45:06.217 --> 45:08.518
Watch and learn.

45:15.493 --> 45:17.461
Captain De Noli, my employer,
Leonardo Da Vinci,

45:17.528 --> 45:20.339
Lorenzo Medici's
war engineer,

45:20.340 --> 45:22.343
has sent me to humbly request

45:22.368 --> 45:24.464
you delay your voyage
a few short hours.

45:25.370 --> 45:26.837
It could be less.

45:26.904 --> 45:28.872
With artists
it's hard to know,

45:28.940 --> 45:30.707
but I'll reimburse you
for your time.

45:30.775 --> 45:32.743
And all you have to do
is sit there.

45:32.810 --> 45:35.579
That is perfect.

45:35.647 --> 45:37.180
Like a mute.

45:37.248 --> 45:38.448
Alas...

45:38.516 --> 45:42.252
I've already made my own
agreements with the Captain.

45:45.523 --> 45:50.460
Well, I must say,
it is good to see you both.

45:50.528 --> 45:53.497
Our last encounter
left me so--

45:53.564 --> 45:56.366
empty-handed.

45:56.434 --> 45:58.769
Now, let's see what gifts
you've brought me,

45:58.836 --> 46:03.073
while the Captain fetches
my own little trinket from the hold.

46:15.353 --> 46:20.424
The undiscovered land
that hides the Vault.

46:20.491 --> 46:21.658
Remarkable.

46:21.726 --> 46:23.460
Truly.

46:29.233 --> 46:33.236
Now, this skin is the
Abyssinian's, is it not?

46:33.304 --> 46:36.707
The codes which complete
the map, presumably.

46:36.774 --> 46:42.112
I wonder...did Da Vinci kill
Solomon Ogbai himself to claim it?

46:42.180 --> 46:44.781
Yes? No?

46:44.849 --> 46:46.016
Nothing?

46:52.623 --> 46:54.791
An astrolabe.

46:58.896 --> 47:02.265
Unlike any
I have seen before.

47:04.368 --> 47:08.138
A device to tame
the stars.

47:12.877 --> 47:15.112
What of the keys
to the Vault?

47:15.179 --> 47:17.748
Still in the Maestro's
possession, you bastard.

47:17.815 --> 47:21.485
I shall have to improvise.
Nevertheless, I thank you.

47:21.552 --> 47:26.757
The keys remain useless without
these tools to guide the way.

47:26.824 --> 47:31.394
And I thank you as well,
dear cousin, once again.

47:31.462 --> 47:33.630
Your duplicitous ways
have borne fruit.

47:33.698 --> 47:35.665
Leonardo
will come for you.

47:35.733 --> 47:37.701
But um...

47:37.769 --> 47:40.203
tragically...

47:40.271 --> 47:41.938
not for you.

47:42.006 --> 47:44.274
<i>Chain her</i>
<i>and the mongrel.</i>

47:44.342 --> 47:47.377
<i>Ready them to face</i>
<i>God's judgment.</i>

48:04.061 --> 48:05.128
What about me?

48:05.196 --> 48:06.797
Worry not, Nico.

48:08.633 --> 48:09.673
I have faith
you will prove

48:09.700 --> 48:11.868
your usefulness
to me in time.

48:29.187 --> 48:32.389
Two visits in a week, brother.

48:32.456 --> 48:37.360
I must be blessed to receive
such a holy honor.

48:37.428 --> 48:40.330
Perhaps I simply lack
satisfactory entertainment.

48:40.398 --> 48:44.434
Or perhaps your plans
for Florence,

48:44.502 --> 48:47.270
have fallen short
of their aims.

48:47.338 --> 48:49.639
How could you possibly
know this?

48:49.707 --> 48:53.109
Your guards?
I shall remove their tongues.

48:53.177 --> 48:56.246
<i>Your face is mine,</i>
<i>Alessandro.</i>

48:59.150 --> 49:00.817
I know its every contour,

49:00.885 --> 49:04.454
what causes it to smile,
to grimace.

49:04.522 --> 49:06.790
It reveals all.

49:16.234 --> 49:19.603
You should have
foreseen this.

49:19.670 --> 49:24.808
Any endeavor to win the hearts
of Christians by force

49:24.876 --> 49:28.778
will never be blessed
with God's favor.

49:28.846 --> 49:32.515
You dare instruct me
on God's wishes?

49:36.220 --> 49:40.056
Hubris, given
your current situation.

49:40.124 --> 49:44.227
Then it is a sin
we both share.

49:44.295 --> 49:48.198
For pride created
this dilemma you now face.

49:48.266 --> 49:51.234
If the Medicis
remain in power,

49:51.302 --> 49:55.405
all of Florence
will turn from Rome.

49:55.473 --> 49:59.476
Your only course is
to quarantine the city.

50:01.812 --> 50:06.583
Do you seriously expect me
to accept your counsel?

50:06.651 --> 50:08.618
You are here,
are you not?

50:10.688 --> 50:14.724
I'm drawn to recall
that day from our youth.

50:14.792 --> 50:19.796
When you held me beneath
the icy waters of the Orba.

50:19.864 --> 50:22.799
Sadly, the Lord had
other plans.

50:22.867 --> 50:25.702
I've always believed
that your inability

50:25.770 --> 50:29.572
to take my life
stemmed from cowardice.

50:31.809 --> 50:34.577
But perhaps,

50:34.645 --> 50:39.149
you wish to utilize
the wisdom I have to offer.

50:39.216 --> 50:41.117
Huh?

50:42.186 --> 50:45.355
So, what do you suggest,
Francesco?

50:45.423 --> 50:47.624
Seek out a champion.

50:47.692 --> 50:50.727
And put him to the cause.

50:50.795 --> 50:54.631
If Girolamo's no longer
capable then,

50:54.699 --> 50:56.967
perhaps--

50:57.034 --> 51:00.537
King Ferrante of Naples

51:00.604 --> 51:02.706
<i>will serve you better.</i>

51:02.773 --> 51:07.210
I've always found Ferrante's
commitment wonderfully,

51:07.278 --> 51:10.513
fanatical.

51:13.284 --> 51:16.353
Do you doubt the logic
of my proposal?

51:16.420 --> 51:17.754
No, no, no.

51:17.822 --> 51:20.824
No.

51:20.891 --> 51:24.394
It's your motives I have
a difficult time trusting.

51:24.462 --> 51:28.231
You must know by now,

51:28.299 --> 51:32.535
that despite all that has
transpired between us,

51:32.603 --> 51:38.541
I will always serve
the best interests of Rome.

51:41.846 --> 51:43.313
<i>Through my holy</i>
<i>anointing,</i>

51:43.381 --> 51:48.518
<i>may the Lord bless you</i>
<i>and pardon you,</i>

51:48.586 --> 51:51.054
<i>whatever sins</i>
<i>you have committed.</i>

51:51.122 --> 51:52.422
Please, don't do this.

51:52.490 --> 51:55.025
We'll tell you what you want,
do what you need.

51:55.092 --> 51:57.060
They have nothing
to offer.

51:57.128 --> 51:59.362
Say farewell.

52:01.265 --> 52:03.466
I demand the right
to my last words.

52:05.903 --> 52:07.203
Nico...

52:07.271 --> 52:09.672
the first time this snake lets
down his guard,

52:09.740 --> 52:12.509
sink a dagger and slice
him from balls to brains.

52:12.576 --> 52:14.277
A touching sentiment.

52:14.345 --> 52:18.148
And I would be profoundly
curious to see him try.

52:22.586 --> 52:27.057
And what of you, cousin?

52:27.124 --> 52:30.527
Silent, when there is
no one to seduce.

52:32.129 --> 52:35.098
I do not say farewell
without regret, Lucrezia.

52:36.300 --> 52:39.469
For what it's worth,
though,

52:39.537 --> 52:43.573
I would have spared Amelia,
if I could.

52:43.641 --> 52:47.710
Don't you dare speak her name.
Don't you dare!

52:49.113 --> 52:52.682
May God have mercy
on both our souls.

53:02.860 --> 53:05.462
I regret never
having fucked you.

53:17.875 --> 53:20.376
You have failed us,
Da Vinci.

53:20.444 --> 53:23.346
You are not the one we hoped.

53:23.414 --> 53:26.116
<i>It is a dark hour.</i>

53:26.183 --> 53:28.485
And your arrogant belief
you are capable

53:28.552 --> 53:32.755
of anything
has only made it darker.

53:32.823 --> 53:34.791
I couldn't abandon Lorenzo.

53:34.859 --> 53:38.695
So you abandon
your destiny!

53:38.762 --> 53:42.732
You have allowed your
sympathy for others

53:42.800 --> 53:47.070
to blind you to
the greater struggle.

53:47.138 --> 53:49.105
And in so doing,

53:49.173 --> 53:54.077
you may have lost everything.

53:54.145 --> 53:58.248
I told you there would
be consequences.

53:58.315 --> 54:03.052
You cannot even grasp what your
actions have wrought!

54:03.120 --> 54:08.858
Because of you, the Book Of
Leaves will be lost forever.

54:08.926 --> 54:11.528
Or worse,

54:11.595 --> 54:14.964
recovered by our enemies.

54:15.032 --> 54:16.533
The Vatican?

54:16.600 --> 54:20.603
I speak of agents
far more ancient

54:20.671 --> 54:24.674
than the Church
