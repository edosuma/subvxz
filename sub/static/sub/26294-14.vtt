WEBVTT

00:04.221 --> 00:06.267
- Okay, three of those.

00:06.310 --> 00:09.096
What?
Who ordered waffles?

00:09.139 --> 00:10.532
Uh, uh-uh, no.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.925
We are having a farm fresh
breakfast in Fowlerton.

00:12.969 --> 00:14.275
- Okay.

00:14.318 --> 00:16.320
- Do not scare her off.
- Oh, please.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.148
There is no way I'd miss
a chance to go

00:18.192 --> 00:19.758
to Fowlerton, Indiana.

00:19.802 --> 00:23.849
I hear they have barns
and trees and a movie theater.

00:23.893 --> 00:26.591
- Um, no, you're thinking of
Muncie, about 40 minutes out.

00:26.635 --> 00:27.984
- It's a good thing for you
I wanna get the hell

00:28.028 --> 00:29.507
out of Chicago.

00:29.551 --> 00:31.814
There's no way I wanna watch
couples all over the place

00:31.857 --> 00:33.207
on Valentine's Day.
- You're all set, ladies.

00:33.250 --> 00:34.860
- Yeah, thank you.

00:34.904 --> 00:37.515
Uh, don't you and Kyle have
some trouble to get into?

00:37.559 --> 00:39.256
- Kyle is at a conference
in Atlanta,

00:39.300 --> 00:42.216
but I let him know where
he can send flowers.

00:42.259 --> 00:43.956
Okay, we gotta get going
'cause my parents are waiting

00:44.000 --> 00:45.654
to give us the key.
- Okay.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.873
Uh, I just gotta drop off
this glassware at Molly's North

00:47.917 --> 00:49.875
and I will be right behind you.
- Okay.

00:49.919 --> 00:52.356
Take County Road
exit 19 off I-65.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.966
That's way faster than
what Google tells you.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.055
- Got it.
- Okay.

00:55.098 --> 00:56.186
- Okay.
- Whoo-hoo!

00:56.230 --> 00:58.971
Giddy-up, ladies!
- Yeah!

01:04.890 --> 01:08.068
- Who took the wooden spoons?
- Already claimed.

01:08.111 --> 01:10.722
- Just grab a spatula
or something.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.202
- Amateurs.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.508
- Captain, this is ridiculous.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.118
They're stinking up
the firehouse.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.424
- I think my nose is bleeding.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.861
Or it's filing
a formal protest.

01:18.904 --> 01:21.342
- You gotta do something.
This is an unsafe environment.

01:21.385 --> 01:24.040
- Hey, cut it, Ogle, McAuley.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.998
You guys are just
fill-in paramedics.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.174
You don't get any say.

01:27.217 --> 01:29.001
- That's discrimination.

01:29.045 --> 01:30.612
- Mmm, no it's not.

01:30.655 --> 01:34.920
- Okay, the Great 51
Chili Cook-Off of 2019

01:34.964 --> 01:35.921
has officially begun.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.969
Team one, Herrmann and Mouch,
you get the bullpen.

01:40.012 --> 01:41.536
Ritter, Tuesday,
you have the kitchen.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.668
Capp, Tony, you have
the Squad Table.

01:43.712 --> 01:46.149
Otis and Cruz,
you have the hallway

01:46.193 --> 01:47.585
out by the bathroom.
- Oh, come on!

01:47.629 --> 01:49.021
- But, Chief, this is, like,
the third time--

01:49.065 --> 01:50.545
- No arguments,
no complaints.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.155
Okay.

01:52.199 --> 01:55.811
Judgment will begin
at 8:00 p.m.

01:55.854 --> 01:58.640
I have spoken.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.339
There you go.

02:02.383 --> 02:07.214
- Um, it's, uh, gonna be
competitive this year.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.129
What are you looking for
in terms of flavor?

02:09.172 --> 02:11.043
- Well, it's a slow shift.

02:11.087 --> 02:14.438
Could have something with
a little bit of a kick to it.

02:15.744 --> 02:17.180
- See, what you don't know
because you grew up

02:17.224 --> 02:19.226
in steel country is that
Orville Redenbacher

02:19.269 --> 02:21.445
raised his corn right here
in Indiana.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.928
- I know.
- Wow.

02:29.279 --> 02:30.280
- What's this?

02:46.340 --> 02:49.473
- My, uh, steering column
conked out on me.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.301
- How long have you
been stuck out here?

02:51.345 --> 02:53.173
- A half hour.

02:53.216 --> 02:56.001
Serves me right
for cutting daylight close.

02:56.045 --> 02:57.525
I'm glad you came by.

02:57.568 --> 03:01.224
No one comes this way since
GPS started telling them

03:01.268 --> 03:02.312
to go up 13.

03:05.272 --> 03:08.971
- Uh, maybe one of you could
hold the flashlight

03:09.014 --> 03:10.320
while I work.

03:14.019 --> 03:16.500
- Um, sure.

03:16.544 --> 03:17.675
Yeah, I might--

03:22.158 --> 03:24.247
Look out!

03:50.491 --> 03:51.840
- Hey, are you okay?

03:51.883 --> 03:53.624
Yeah.

03:53.668 --> 03:54.799
I think so.

03:54.843 --> 03:57.802
- Okay.
Okay.

03:57.846 --> 04:01.023
Hey, sir?
Can you hear me?

04:01.066 --> 04:02.807
- Yeah.
- You gotta be kidding me.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.809
I got no bars out here.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.463
Hold tight.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.291
- I'm a paramedic.
My name is Sylvie.

04:08.335 --> 04:09.945
- I'm Duane Reynolds.

04:09.988 --> 04:11.599
- Whoa, hey,
don't move your leg.

04:16.691 --> 04:18.301
- Hey.
- It won't budge!

04:18.345 --> 04:20.303
- All right, all right.
Um, let me see what I can do.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.610
- Okay, I got kids in here!
- Okay!

04:24.742 --> 04:26.701
Okay.

04:26.744 --> 04:28.398
All right, move out the way,
okay?

04:44.153 --> 04:45.894
How many we got?
- Uh, we got eight plus me.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.330
Uh, Sparkman High School
hockey team.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.898
I'm Coach Snyder.
- I'm Emily Foster.

04:49.941 --> 04:52.204
I'm a paramedic in
the Chicago Fire Department.

04:52.248 --> 04:54.859
So I'm gonna need you to let me
take the lead on this.

04:54.903 --> 04:56.165
- Yeah, how can I help?

04:56.208 --> 04:57.558
- Okay.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.995
I need you to climb up there
and assist me in getting

05:00.038 --> 05:02.911
the boys out of here.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.956
All right, boys,
is there anyone

05:05.000 --> 05:06.436
with any major injuries?

05:06.480 --> 05:07.785
- Uh, Austin's pretty
bad over here.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.221
His--His arm is--

05:09.265 --> 05:10.788
- I--I think it busted
out of its socket.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.442
- Okay.

05:12.486 --> 05:16.098
Everyone else, if you can move,
carefully work your way

05:16.141 --> 05:18.056
around Austin and clear
out the bus.

05:18.100 --> 05:22.322
Yeah?
You need help?

05:22.365 --> 05:23.192
- Who's first?

05:23.235 --> 05:24.628
- All right, I'm coming out.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.108
- Let's go, Cormac.

05:26.151 --> 05:29.720
Come on.

05:29.764 --> 05:32.114
There you go.
Careful going down.

05:32.157 --> 05:34.246
- Oh, it looks like
a complete fracture.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.552
Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.860
- Watch yourself now.
Let's go.

05:38.903 --> 05:41.602
You got it, watch your step.
They're coming down.

05:41.645 --> 05:42.864
- Okay.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.954
You okay?
Oh.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.477
Right there.
- Take your time.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.218
It's okay.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.307
- Austin, breathe for me.
Deep breaths.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.962
- There you go.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.442
- Watch the glass.
Watch the glass.

05:55.485 --> 05:56.660
- Right here on this one.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.009
Oh!

05:58.053 --> 06:00.098
You okay?
- Good.

06:00.142 --> 06:02.710
- All right, Hollis.
Let's go, buddy.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.451
- Yep.

06:04.494 --> 06:05.756
You good?
- Yeah.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.671
- All right.
Go to that bar, yeah.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.109
Is--Is anyone hurt?

06:11.153 --> 06:12.763
Did anybody lose consciousness?

06:15.070 --> 06:16.898
- We were joking around.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.900
Everyone going crazy
'cause we won tonight.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.294
I might have distracted Coach.

06:22.338 --> 06:25.689
- Hey, Hollis,
you didn't distract anyone.

06:25.733 --> 06:28.431
I shouldn't have been going so
fast in the fog on a back road.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.607
This is on me.

06:33.305 --> 06:36.439
- Um, okay, we don't want
any more surprises.

06:36.483 --> 06:39.311
Even if the fog lifts,
it's dark out here.

06:39.355 --> 06:41.401
I've got some flares
in my trunk.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.577
Can you boys put them out
in both directions?

06:43.620 --> 06:45.579
- Should I blast your car horn,
signal for help?

06:45.622 --> 06:47.232
- No one will hear.

06:47.276 --> 06:49.365
Nearest farmhouse
is eight miles that way.

06:50.975 --> 06:54.239
- Um, anyone with a cell phone
should try and get a signal.

06:54.283 --> 06:57.808
And just keep moving
as much as you can.

06:57.852 --> 06:59.462
It's gonna get real
cold out here.

06:59.506 --> 07:00.463
- Yes, ma'am.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.638
- Okay.

07:01.682 --> 07:03.335
- Hey, Austin.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.250
Focus on me, okay?
- Oh!

07:05.294 --> 07:07.209
- Just breathe.
Austin, hey.

07:07.252 --> 07:08.689
Hey, we're in this together,
okay?

07:08.732 --> 07:09.907
- It's me and you.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.866
You got this.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.258
- How we looking down there?

07:13.302 --> 07:15.478
- Austin's arm got thrown
out of socket.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.001
I might need some
help down here!

07:20.527 --> 07:22.485
- Hey.

07:22.529 --> 07:25.357
Um, I'm gonna need to put
a splint around this leg.

07:25.401 --> 07:28.491
I need something strong
and straight like a--

07:28.535 --> 07:31.059
like a crowbar or--
- How about hockey sticks?

07:31.102 --> 07:32.843
- Yeah, that would work.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.936
Do you live around here?
- Other side of town.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.982
I was coming back
from helping out a buddy

07:41.025 --> 07:42.331
with his new pasture.

07:42.374 --> 07:45.508
There's just nothing out here.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.864
- They're having a special
molecular gastronomy dinner

07:53.908 --> 07:55.387
for Valentine's Day.

07:55.431 --> 07:57.389
I happened to make a
reservation for the four of us.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.653
- Chloe will love that.
- Hey!

07:59.696 --> 08:01.742
Get out of here.
- Yeah, you know the rules.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.134
This is our hallway.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.746
- I am just going
to my bunk where I left

08:05.789 --> 08:07.748
my lumbar support pillow.
- Mm-hmm.

08:07.791 --> 08:08.879
- Not today.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.620
- We know a spy
when we see one.

08:10.664 --> 08:12.448
- Oh, please.
- Cooking outside the bathroom.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.755
I can't count how many health
violations this involves.

08:14.798 --> 08:17.279
- I once got a bacterial
infection from a bar of soap

08:17.322 --> 08:19.063
that was sitting next
to the sink too long.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.500
Think about that.
- I don't have to.

08:20.543 --> 08:21.457
It's ridiculous.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.111
- Mouch, go around
the other way.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.200
- Is there a problem here?
- How much time you got?

08:25.243 --> 08:26.506
Look, for one--

08:26.549 --> 08:27.811
- Mouch is trying to scout
our ingredients.

08:27.855 --> 08:29.421
- Absurd accusation.

08:29.465 --> 08:32.816
- Firehouse conflict is the
leading cause of low morale.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.078
- You're the leading cause
of low morale.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.733
- That's it!

08:36.777 --> 08:38.735
Everyone out of the hallway
except Cruz and Otis.

08:38.779 --> 08:40.389
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.260
- Nice contest, Captain.
- Mm-hmm.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.915
- Leading cause.
- Not the facts.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.265
- My pillow.
- I got it.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.791
- When do we get
our girls back?

08:51.618 --> 08:53.750
- They're probably having
the time of their lives.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.535
- But--

08:59.451 --> 09:01.279
- Hi, Herrmann.
What's up?

09:01.323 --> 09:04.805
- Uh, hey, uh, have you left
for Indiana yet?

09:04.848 --> 09:06.458
- I'm about to.
Why?

09:06.502 --> 09:08.069
- Ah, good.
All right, listen.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.592
The delivery guy who was
supposed to come

09:09.636 --> 09:11.246
by Molly's tomorrow,
he got the date wrong,

09:11.289 --> 09:13.596
and he's over there now.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.773
So could you swing by
and sign for everything?

09:16.817 --> 09:18.166
Please?

09:18.209 --> 09:20.211
You're killing me, Herrmann.

09:20.255 --> 09:22.953
- Please, please, please?
And thank you.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.607
- Yeah.
Yeah, fine.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.217
- His name is Sikorsky
or Sekulsky.

09:26.261 --> 09:28.132
- Yeah, okay.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.137
- Well?

09:33.181 --> 09:38.055
- Um, Otis and Cruz
are using habanero sauce.

09:38.969 --> 09:41.624
- Good work.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.114
- Come grab him, Coach.

09:53.157 --> 09:56.813
- Okay, what's up, Austin?
You okay, buddy?

09:56.857 --> 09:58.510
- Nope.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.997
- Duane...

10:07.041 --> 10:10.087
This is gonna hurt.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.785
- Go for it.

10:21.795 --> 10:22.883
- That's it, that's it.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.536
- Okay.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.756
All right, come on this side.

10:28.366 --> 10:32.153
- You're doing great.
Hold that.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.459
Thank you.
- Uh, anything you need?

10:34.503 --> 10:37.114
- What's your name?
- Hollis Oree.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.681
We're on the hockey team
at Sparkman.

10:40.074 --> 10:42.772
I read about you in the paper.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.600
You're in the quarter finals.

10:45.819 --> 10:48.125
Supposed to get thumped.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.518
- We've been doubted
all season.

10:51.868 --> 10:52.869
- Here we go.
Push up.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.960
I'm just trying to get these
boys home before midnight.

10:57.004 --> 10:59.049
Our school's over in Markle.

10:59.093 --> 11:00.660
We were playing
in the quarters.

11:00.703 --> 11:04.011
No one gave us a chance to win.
- No, not even you.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.709
- What?
- Nothing.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.711
- Hunter's not out here!

11:08.755 --> 11:10.060
- Come again?

11:10.104 --> 11:12.236
- Hunter's still on the bus!

11:12.280 --> 11:13.760
- He was all the way
in the back.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.631
- Hunter?

11:15.675 --> 11:16.501
Hunter!

11:16.545 --> 11:17.720
Hunter!

11:17.764 --> 11:19.330
- It's okay, it's okay.
Okay.

11:19.374 --> 11:21.506
Okay, we'll deal with Hunter
in a second.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.683
First, pull as hard
as you can on my count.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.729
- Coach.
Hey!

11:26.773 --> 11:27.904
Coach.

11:27.948 --> 11:30.254
- Yeah.
Pull on your count.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.734
I got you.
- Yeah.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.170
- Austin, you ready?

11:33.214 --> 11:34.171
Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.477
- Look at me.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.219
One, two, three.

11:40.134 --> 11:41.744
- It's okay!
It's okay!

11:41.788 --> 11:43.050
It's all right.

11:43.093 --> 11:45.095
Coach, let's get him up
and out, all right?

11:45.139 --> 11:46.270
While I look for Hunter.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.968
- All right.
Jacob!

11:48.011 --> 11:49.056
Hollis!

11:49.099 --> 11:50.361
Get back on top of the bus!

11:50.405 --> 11:52.102
You gotta help Austin
get out of here!

11:52.146 --> 11:53.930
- Hunter?
- He can't use his arm!

11:53.974 --> 11:55.453
- All right!

11:55.497 --> 11:57.455
- Hunter?

11:57.499 --> 11:59.936
What was up with that comment?

11:59.980 --> 12:02.025
- Forget it.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.288
- Okay, Coach.

12:04.332 --> 12:05.725
- Hunter!

12:05.768 --> 12:07.335
- Easy.
Watch his shoulder.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.989
Got him?
Grab his leg.

12:09.032 --> 12:09.990
- Hunter!

12:12.166 --> 12:13.994
Hey, I got him!
He's back here!

12:14.037 --> 12:17.127
- Be right there.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.738
- Brett!

12:18.781 --> 12:21.349
- Hey, are you Brett?
- Yeah.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.524
- Your friend's
calling for you.

12:22.567 --> 12:25.527
- Okay, I'll be right back.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.921
- Come on.
I'll give you a hand.

12:27.964 --> 12:28.965
Hang on right there.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.667
- What is it?
- I got a kid back here.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.757
His neck's at an angle
and his air's cut off.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.195
He can't breathe.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.377
- Hang in there, Hunter.
I'm right here.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.552
Just keep breathing.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.731
- His neck's hyperextended
and he's not getting oxygen.

12:57.211 --> 13:00.040
- I can't really hold a grip
to get his airways open.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.825
- Uh, Coach?
- Yeah?

13:02.869 --> 13:04.218
- You guys have
any neck guards?

13:04.261 --> 13:05.654
- Yeah, yeah.
They're, uh--

13:05.697 --> 13:06.742
They're in the equipment bags.

13:07.874 --> 13:11.703
- Okay.
Stay with me.

13:11.747 --> 13:12.879
- Here.
- Thanks.

13:12.922 --> 13:13.880
Here you go.

13:13.923 --> 13:15.838
- Thanks.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.753
- Okay, now,
it should be tight.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.234
- Is that better?

13:20.277 --> 13:21.278
- Yeah.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.326
- Okay, we gotta get
this seat off him, guys.

13:26.414 --> 13:27.589
My side.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.767
- Guys, he's mashed
in there pretty good.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.464
- Okay, we--we gotta pull
this off of him.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.597
- All right, let me--let me get
behind and lift here, okay?

13:35.640 --> 13:36.946
- Okay.

13:36.990 --> 13:39.209
- Just hold tight.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.908
- All right, ready?
One, two, three.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.648
Lift.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.739
All right, again.
All right?

13:47.783 --> 13:50.873
One, two, three.
Lift.

13:55.008 --> 13:58.446
- Okay, we gotta get something
to force it up.

13:58.489 --> 13:59.621
- I've got a jack in my car.

13:59.664 --> 14:00.883
- All right, I got it.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.232
You--You, uh,
stay here with him.

14:02.276 --> 14:03.103
- Yeah.

14:03.146 --> 14:04.844
- Okay.
Hey.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.629
Hunter, will you
watch right here, okay?

14:07.672 --> 14:09.370
- Yeah, okay.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.809
You know, my mom didn't
want me to play this year.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.158
- Oh, yeah?

14:15.202 --> 14:17.900
- She said we wouldn't
amount to much.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.598
Said I shouldn't miss school
for sports anyway.

14:20.642 --> 14:23.036
- Sounds like our moms
would have gotten along.

14:24.167 --> 14:25.690
- Hollis said you won.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.562
- We did.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.085
Three to two.

14:29.129 --> 14:32.654
And a lot of parents came.

14:32.697 --> 14:34.961
My--my mom had work.

14:37.093 --> 14:39.704
- Well, the good news is you
don't have a concussion.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.404
- Oh, oh, hey, Hunter, we're
gonna get this seat off of you,

14:43.447 --> 14:45.493
but you gotta try
not to move until then, okay?

14:45.536 --> 14:48.322
- Okay, okay.

14:48.365 --> 14:51.586
- Oxtails are held
in high culinary regard

14:51.629 --> 14:53.849
all over the world.
- Yeah, well, this is Chicago.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.764
- Look, we played
it safe last year.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.548
- We got second.
- We lost.

14:58.985 --> 15:02.379
Look, I know it's a risk.
But it's worth it.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.992
- What's that?
- Oxtails.

15:06.035 --> 15:09.082
Look, cook offs are as much
a game of the mind

15:09.125 --> 15:10.692
as they are of the chili.

15:10.735 --> 15:14.870
You have to shock, surprise,
overwhelm the taste buds,

15:14.914 --> 15:16.611
or else you're an also-ran.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.395
And I'm just--I'm not gonna
have it this year.

15:18.439 --> 15:21.007
- Lieutenant, will you please
tell him that he's crazy?

15:23.879 --> 15:27.535
- No B.S.

15:27.578 --> 15:28.840
Boden loves oxtails.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.190
- That's what I've been saying!

15:30.233 --> 15:31.713
- Lieutenant,
you're killing me here.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.541
- No, no, no, hey.
- Look at it, just look at it.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.151
- You're not going to put--
- Take your hand off them!

15:35.195 --> 15:36.805
- I swear, you're not gonna
put it in there!

15:36.848 --> 15:37.980
No way it's gonna happen!

15:38.024 --> 15:40.026
- Yeah, I'm using
my mom's recipe.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.418
I've never actually
made it before,

15:41.462 --> 15:45.553
but the secret
is bacon grease.

15:45.596 --> 15:47.642
- Smoke break?

15:47.685 --> 15:49.687
- Sure.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.167
- You're gonna freeze.

16:02.396 --> 16:03.875
Got it!

16:06.748 --> 16:08.706
All right, uh...

16:10.056 --> 16:11.927
Okay.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.407
- All right.

16:15.626 --> 16:16.758
- Hang in there, Hunter.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.805
Breathe, buddy.

16:20.849 --> 16:22.242
All right, buddy.

16:22.285 --> 16:23.243
- How you doing, Hunter?

16:24.461 --> 16:25.593
- We gotta help guide it off.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.029
- Uh-huh.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.944
- Okay.
- All right.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.647
- There it goes.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.098
- What happened?

16:52.141 --> 16:53.534
- Piece of the seat
stuck in his side.

16:53.577 --> 16:54.665
He's bleeding out.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.189
God, I--I can't see
anything in here.

16:56.232 --> 16:57.581
We gotta get him out of here.
- Okay.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.148
- All right, let me go
get help, all right?

17:03.326 --> 17:06.590
- It's okay, it's okay.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.510
- All right, hand me that pad.

17:13.554 --> 17:14.511
- Yeah.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.166
- Yeah.
Okay.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.690
- Um, get some tape.

17:19.734 --> 17:20.865
Is there tape?

17:20.909 --> 17:23.085
Let's see.
Right behind you.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.218
- All right, so, just keep
breathing, Hunter.

17:26.784 --> 17:30.092
- Hey, Mustangs,
all hands over here now.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.058
- Okay, Hunter?

17:39.101 --> 17:42.713
I'm gonna need you to hold your
side so we can get you out.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.193
Coach, you ready?
- Yeah.

17:44.237 --> 17:46.717
Jacob, get up here!
We're bringing him out!

17:46.761 --> 17:49.764
- Okay?
- One, two, three.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.203
- I got you.
I got you.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.686
- Okay, watch it.
Stay up against the wall there.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.688
Stay up against the wall
and you're good.

18:00.731 --> 18:01.645
There you go.

18:01.689 --> 18:02.646
Hold him up to me, all right?

18:03.778 --> 18:04.735
I got you, buddy.
- Please.

18:04.779 --> 18:05.867
- I got you, bud.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.651
- Grab him!

18:07.695 --> 18:09.523
- Easy, easy, easy.
Go slow.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.612
- Whoa, whoa.
- Easy.

18:11.655 --> 18:13.657
- Legs are coming out.
- Easy.

18:13.701 --> 18:15.398
- I'm right behind you.
- You got him?

18:15.442 --> 18:17.096
- Yep.
- Okay.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.010
- You're good?
- Yeah.

18:19.054 --> 18:21.404
- All right, set him down
easy, guys.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.754
- Look out, guys.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.104
- Grab that flashlight!

18:30.718 --> 18:32.241
It's--It's deep.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.766
- Hey, come here.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.246
- Hollis?
- Yeah.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.248
- Um, I have a bottle
of tequila in my trunk

18:39.292 --> 18:40.771
next to a duffle.
Can you bring me both?

18:40.815 --> 18:41.772
- You got it.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.128
- Jacob, what's going on?

18:49.171 --> 18:50.912
- Well, Cormac
and me were talking,

18:50.955 --> 18:52.957
and since--since no other cars
have driven by

18:53.001 --> 18:54.785
and we can't get a signal,
we're gonna run back

18:54.829 --> 18:55.786
to the interstate.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.401
- Uh, it's at least
five miles behind us.

19:01.444 --> 19:02.793
- Six.

19:04.578 --> 19:06.275
- We run cross country.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.455
- Even if we stop the bleeding,

19:12.499 --> 19:13.848
he's still gonna
need a surgeon.

19:16.285 --> 19:17.721
- Okay.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.332
Cormac and I will go.
- We got it.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.508
- Jacob, I'm the coach.
I will tell you what--

19:21.551 --> 19:22.683
- No, you're not.

19:26.382 --> 19:27.688
Not for much longer.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.125
- What?

19:30.169 --> 19:32.171
- He's quitting after
the season's over.

19:32.214 --> 19:35.174
Going to go coach for some
school with a fancier program.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.747
- Whatever you guys
wanna think of me,

19:43.791 --> 19:45.401
that is fine.

19:45.445 --> 19:48.317
But right now tonight
I am still your coach,

19:48.361 --> 19:50.493
and I am the one
making the decisions.

19:50.537 --> 19:53.496
And I can't have two boys
running on this road

19:53.540 --> 19:54.932
at night by themselves.

19:54.976 --> 19:57.370
And I need a leader
to stay behind and help.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.414
And that's you, Jacob.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.200
The captain.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.205
I made that pick for a reason.

20:09.643 --> 20:10.818
Let's go, Cormac.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.260
Now!

20:37.279 --> 20:41.675
- And that should be it.
- Um, what about the Shiner?

20:43.242 --> 20:44.504
- Oh, man.
Seriously?

20:45.940 --> 20:48.029
- Hey, really, it's okay.
You know what?

20:48.072 --> 20:49.204
Uh, just give us a credit.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.379
- No, no.
Could you wait a bit?

20:50.423 --> 20:51.554
I'll run back and grab it now.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.077
- Um--
- Just 30 minutes.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.470
My boss will kill me
if I screw up another order.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.736
- Fine.

21:05.916 --> 21:08.919
- You've reached Sylvie Brett.
Please leave a message.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.312
- Oh, what?

21:10.356 --> 21:11.618
You guys are already
having so much fun

21:11.661 --> 21:13.620
you can't answer the phone?

21:13.663 --> 21:14.838
- It's okay.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.405
- This one?
- Yeah.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.451
Okay, got it.

21:18.494 --> 21:19.539
Yeah.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.586
All right.
Will this work?

21:23.630 --> 21:25.414
- It's gonna have to.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.676
- All right.

21:28.765 --> 21:31.551
- Just hold tight, okay?

21:34.162 --> 21:36.599
Okay.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.651
- Talk to him.

21:44.694 --> 21:45.956
- What do you mean?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.871
- Just talk to him
while we work.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.308
Tell him a story.
Anything.

21:49.351 --> 21:50.613
Keep his mind
on something else.

21:52.789 --> 21:56.489
Okay, Hunter?
I'm not gonna lie.

21:56.532 --> 21:59.013
This is gonna be rough.
But you can do it.

21:59.056 --> 22:00.884
Just focus on Jacob, okay?
- Okay.

22:00.928 --> 22:04.410
- Hey, remember that first week
of practice, Hunter?

22:07.413 --> 22:10.067
- Where--where we'd just sit
on the locker room floor

22:10.111 --> 22:11.808
after practice because we were
too tired to move?

22:13.419 --> 22:16.465
- And I wanted to quit.
A lot of us did.

22:16.509 --> 22:19.250
But you said it wasn't
about hockey.

22:19.294 --> 22:20.991
You said it was
about each other.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.994
And we couldn't quit
on each other.

22:24.038 --> 22:25.474
So don't give up on us now,
Hunter.

22:29.217 --> 22:31.088
- This is nothing.
You've got this.

22:31.132 --> 22:33.090
- Feels like there's still
a piece of metal in there.

22:33.134 --> 22:35.441
It must have snapped off
of the seat.

22:35.484 --> 22:37.834
Do you have tweezers in there?
- Yeah.

22:40.837 --> 22:42.491
Use that.
- Okay.

22:44.972 --> 22:47.888
- Keep going.
- Don't quit now, Hunter.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.196
- It's okay, buddy.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.850
- Not like Coach.
Don't you do it.

22:55.069 --> 22:56.853
- We need you.
- Deep breath.

22:56.897 --> 22:58.594
Uh-huh.

23:00.988 --> 23:03.599
- Good job.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.298
- Oh, no.
- What? What's wrong?

23:07.342 --> 23:09.388
- Hey, somebody get me a flare!

23:09.431 --> 23:10.867
- Yeah, I got it.

23:30.191 --> 23:32.715
- Boys, we have to stop
the bleeding.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.064
All right, Brett.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.992
If you can't watch this,
turn your eyes away now.

24:01.178 --> 24:02.092
- Okay.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.011
- It's okay.

24:08.055 --> 24:09.186
He's okay.
- Okay.

24:09.230 --> 24:11.101
It's okay, boys.
It's done.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.755
The bleeding stopped.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.931
- Boys, do you have any--do you
have any extra clothing

24:14.975 --> 24:16.237
or blankets on the bus?

24:16.280 --> 24:17.499
We gotta--we gotta
keep him warm.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.066
- We've got some jerseys
in the team bag.

24:19.109 --> 24:20.067
- Yeah, I'll grab them.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.034
- Jacob?

24:41.349 --> 24:42.437
- He's not breathing.

24:44.047 --> 24:45.962
- Do you know how to check
for a pulse?

24:46.006 --> 24:47.094
Come here.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.530
You keep your fingers
right here.

24:48.574 --> 24:49.662
- Uh-huh.

24:49.705 --> 24:50.793
- Uh-huh.
You feel that?

24:50.837 --> 24:52.229
- Yeah.
- Count to 60.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.057
If it takes longer than
a minute you let me know.

24:54.101 --> 24:55.537
- Okay.

24:59.454 --> 25:00.803
- Blunt force trauma.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.196
He must have gotten hit
in the accident.

25:02.239 --> 25:03.545
And he doesn't have a pulse.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.155
We're gonna have
to do this old school.

25:06.635 --> 25:08.985
Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

25:16.689 --> 25:17.646
- Go again.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.479
- Nothing.

25:26.742 --> 25:30.790
- Um, does anybody have
an epi shot?

25:30.833 --> 25:33.401
- In my bag.
But it's still on the bus.

25:33.444 --> 25:34.663
- I'll start compressions.
- Okay, great.

25:34.707 --> 25:35.664
Let's get it.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.627
What's your last name again?
- Uh, Oree.

25:41.670 --> 25:45.021
- Oree, Oree.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.373
- I-I don't see it.

25:49.417 --> 25:51.462
- You sure it isn't outside?
- I don't think so.

25:53.247 --> 25:55.205
- Oree...

25:57.294 --> 25:59.122
I think I found it.

26:03.866 --> 26:05.607
Oh, damn it.

26:05.651 --> 26:06.739
It's stuck down there.

26:06.782 --> 26:09.524
- Brett!
We're losing him!

26:09.568 --> 26:11.613
Okay.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.881
- I signed for everything,
got us a free case

26:18.925 --> 26:21.667
for the inconvenience.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.320
- Well, that'll make
Herrmann happy.

26:23.364 --> 26:24.844
- Yeah, it better.

26:24.887 --> 26:27.020
I nearly missed half
of Galentine's night for it.

26:27.063 --> 26:28.978
- All right, well,
I'll save you some

26:29.022 --> 26:30.806
of the oxtail-less chili.

26:30.850 --> 26:33.417
- Oh, Cruz shot you down?
- Again.

26:33.461 --> 26:36.246
It's probably for the best.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.380
Uh, hey, listen.
I'm losing signal.

26:39.423 --> 26:42.383
So I will see you Friday.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.613
- How's it going?

26:54.656 --> 26:57.137
- Fine.
You?

26:59.705 --> 27:03.534
- Maybe she needs to go out.

27:03.578 --> 27:05.754
- All right.
Tuesday, come on.

27:20.856 --> 27:24.164
- Joe!
Joe!

27:24.207 --> 27:25.295
Joe!

27:25.339 --> 27:26.775
We gotta pull out
all the stops.

27:26.819 --> 27:28.559
Ritter's chili is delicious!

27:29.517 --> 27:32.389
- Yeah, add some more salt.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.262
- Oh, I knew it!

27:35.305 --> 27:37.525
I knew you guys weren't
out here smoking cigars.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.440
You're making chili.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.224
- Damn right.

27:41.268 --> 27:44.793
And if you want a future at 51,
you're not gonna say a word.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.621
- We're surprise
competitors this year.

27:46.665 --> 27:47.709
- Dark horses.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.145
- And we wanna keep
it that way.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.191
- Oh, okay.
Right.

27:51.234 --> 27:52.888
I'll have to pull out anyway.

27:52.932 --> 27:55.064
Tuesday dropped one of
her chew toys into my pot.

27:55.108 --> 27:57.023
- Really?

27:57.066 --> 27:58.677
You were gonna lose anyway.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.548
- Yeah.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.768
- Six, seven, eight.

28:03.986 --> 28:05.553
His bag is stuck
under the bus.

28:05.596 --> 28:08.208
We gotta rock it off somehow.
Give me a hand, boys.

28:09.905 --> 28:12.386
One, two, three.

28:12.429 --> 28:15.737
One, two, three.

28:15.781 --> 28:19.567
- Hey, miss, maybe try
the lift bucket on the tractor.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.443
The keys are still in it.
- Right.

28:28.271 --> 28:30.360
- You work one of those before?
- Yeah.

28:30.404 --> 28:32.623
Left vertical, right tilt.
- That's it.

28:41.937 --> 28:43.591
What's wrong?

28:43.634 --> 28:45.201
- Oh, I don't know.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.250
It might be stripped.

29:14.404 --> 29:18.060
- Oh, my God.

29:18.104 --> 29:20.628
- What happened?
Brett!

29:20.671 --> 29:23.413
- Oh, my God.
You got him?

29:23.457 --> 29:26.242
- This bus full
of hockey players

29:26.286 --> 29:27.853
just nailed that tractor.

29:27.896 --> 29:30.812
We got one broken leg,
one deep abdominal tear.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.118
We managed to stop
the bleeding.

29:32.161 --> 29:34.642
And one delayed
cardiac arrhythmia.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.035
Precordial thump didn't work.

29:36.078 --> 29:37.471
- Okay, let's get him
in the jeep.

29:37.514 --> 29:39.473
- No, he won't reach
the clinic in time.

29:39.516 --> 29:40.953
We need to lift that bus.

29:40.996 --> 29:42.476
There's an epi shot
in a bag trapped underneath.

29:42.519 --> 29:44.086
We could use it
to restart his heart.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.349
Um, there's some chains
on the tractor.

29:46.393 --> 29:47.655
- Yeah.

29:47.698 --> 29:50.179
- Hey, guys, uh, his
pulse is dropping over here.

29:50.223 --> 29:51.398
- Will you grab him?
Grab him.

29:51.441 --> 29:52.442
- Yeah.

29:52.486 --> 29:53.443
All right.

30:01.234 --> 30:03.976
- Is your heater on?
- Yeah.

30:04.019 --> 30:05.499
- Right, let's get him
into the Jeep.

30:05.542 --> 30:08.676
- Um, Logan, Connor,
help move Hunter.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.332
- One, two, three.
- Go.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.222
Brett, can you back it up?

30:33.266 --> 30:34.528
- On it!

30:37.836 --> 30:38.793
Hold on.

30:41.317 --> 30:43.015
- Give it everything, Brett.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.904
- Hey, how long has it been?

31:02.948 --> 31:05.124
- Six minutes.
- Go.

31:25.187 --> 31:28.974
- Got it!
Got it, got it, got it!

31:54.477 --> 31:56.218
- Oh!

32:03.704 --> 32:07.490
- Good job, good job.

32:12.539 --> 32:13.888
- Okay!

32:13.932 --> 32:15.020
Let's get in the--

32:31.297 --> 32:33.560
- Over here!

32:33.603 --> 32:35.997
They're over here!

32:36.041 --> 32:38.565
- We got a victim with
a deep abdomen puncture.

32:38.608 --> 32:39.653
You guys got a backboard?
- Yeah.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.091
- What happened?

32:43.135 --> 32:45.006
- He's here.

32:45.050 --> 32:47.008
There's a complete fracture.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.663
Obviously we made this splint
out of a hockey stick.

32:49.706 --> 32:51.447
All right.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.726
- This is the worst
Valentine's Day ever.

33:09.770 --> 33:13.034
And that includes what happened
with the DeBolt twins in 2015.

33:13.078 --> 33:17.386
- Listen, no offense,
but next year

33:17.430 --> 33:21.347
I'm staying in bed and
I'm renting "Love, Actually."

33:21.390 --> 33:24.002
- You will not get
an argument from me.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.919
- Sorry it took me so long
to show up.

33:28.963 --> 33:32.314
- We're glad you came
when you did.

33:32.358 --> 33:34.360
- Okay.
Sounds good.

33:34.403 --> 33:35.709
Thanks, doc.

33:38.755 --> 33:41.106
- Hey, uh, how are
the boys looking?

33:41.149 --> 33:43.978
- Well, Jacob is up
and alert and talking.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.197
Says he doesn't even
remember collapsing.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.850
- Scared us.

33:46.894 --> 33:48.156
- The doctor said if you
didn't give him the epi shot

33:48.200 --> 33:50.028
when you did,
he may not be here.

33:50.071 --> 33:53.640
And Hunter, he's, uh--
he got meds in him,

33:53.683 --> 33:55.120
so he's a little loopy.

33:55.163 --> 33:58.340
- But the surgeon said that
what you all did to stop

33:58.384 --> 34:01.082
the bleeding saved his life.

34:01.126 --> 34:04.781
Thank you for all
that you did tonight.

34:04.825 --> 34:06.392
Sincerely.

34:06.435 --> 34:09.699
As far as I'm concerned,
you are all honorary Mustangs

34:09.743 --> 34:11.788
for life.

34:11.832 --> 34:13.268
- Well, we would come see
a game next season,

34:13.312 --> 34:16.228
except it seems like
you're not gonna be here.

34:20.710 --> 34:24.323
- Actually,
I got hurt boys here

34:24.366 --> 34:28.196
and they are going to be
recovering for a while.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.938
What kind of coach would
I be if I quit on them

34:30.981 --> 34:32.548
when they never quit
on themselves?

34:36.030 --> 34:37.771
So you come
to a game next year.

34:37.814 --> 34:39.599
Any game you want.

34:39.642 --> 34:41.340
- You got it.

34:41.383 --> 34:43.342
- Whoa, whoa, hey.

34:43.385 --> 34:45.039
Uh, all right, listen.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.607
The first thing that you need
to know is that every single

34:47.650 --> 34:49.130
one of your boys is okay.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.349
All right?
Come on back.

34:51.872 --> 34:55.354
Sure thing.
All the boys are okay.

34:55.397 --> 34:57.138
- Y'all heard that, right?

34:57.182 --> 35:01.142
Honorary Mustangs.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.579
- Better than a medal any day.

35:03.623 --> 35:05.320
- Duane!

35:05.364 --> 35:06.669
You're not supposed
to be up and about.

35:06.713 --> 35:08.062
- Oh, hell.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.282
Don't tell me what
I can and can't be.

35:10.325 --> 35:13.502
I come from a long
line of Hoosiers.

35:13.546 --> 35:16.157
We're made of sand and grit.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.898
- Well, I'm a Hoosier, too.

35:17.941 --> 35:20.988
- That doesn't surprise
me one bit.

35:21.031 --> 35:24.948
Ladies.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.736
- What's a Hoosier?

35:33.392 --> 35:36.134
- All right, let's go.
Winner take all.

35:42.227 --> 35:43.271
- Oh.

35:53.803 --> 35:56.589
- Oh, wh--wh--what's this?

35:56.632 --> 35:58.895
One more entry.

35:58.939 --> 36:01.202
- No way!
- Are you kidding me?

36:01.246 --> 36:03.813
- According to the rules
set forth in 2002,

36:03.857 --> 36:05.511
teams can enter
the competition any time

36:05.554 --> 36:06.990
before the first taste.

36:08.253 --> 36:11.734
- Well, at least mix them up!

36:11.778 --> 36:13.823
- Okay.
- Yeah.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.269
- Thank you.

36:27.837 --> 36:28.882
- Let's do this.

36:33.930 --> 36:36.977
Mm-hmm.

36:40.850 --> 36:43.288
Mm-hmm-hmm.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.685
Mmm...

36:56.736 --> 36:58.651
Mm?

36:58.694 --> 37:01.131
- That's gotta be good.

37:01.175 --> 37:02.742
- We have a winner.

37:06.354 --> 37:08.791
Team four!

37:10.532 --> 37:12.926
- What?
Wait, who's team number four?

37:12.969 --> 37:15.668
- Ritter, didn't you drop out?
- What?

37:15.711 --> 37:17.017
Why would Ritter drop out?

37:17.060 --> 37:19.846
- Tuesday started
adding ingredients.

37:21.326 --> 37:24.329
- Come on, team four.
Come get your prize.

37:24.372 --> 37:28.768
- I'm sorry, did someone
say team four?

37:28.811 --> 37:30.204
- I believe he did.

37:30.248 --> 37:34.469
- Huh, then I guess
this belongs to us.

37:34.513 --> 37:36.471
Well, thank you, 51.

37:36.515 --> 37:40.432
It has been
a very profitable shift.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.875
- Uh, well, I gotta.

37:48.918 --> 37:51.573
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- All right.

37:51.617 --> 37:53.358
All right.
- Wait, this--this one?

37:53.401 --> 37:55.838
- What's in it?
- Need a spoon.

37:55.882 --> 37:58.798
- Oh.

37:58.841 --> 38:02.323
It's hilarious.

38:02.367 --> 38:05.108
Yeah.
Yeah, no, all good.

38:05.152 --> 38:06.458
- Thank you.
- All right.

38:06.501 --> 38:07.328
See you.

38:07.372 --> 38:10.070
That was Otis.
Thank you.

38:10.113 --> 38:13.465
Uh, apparently
your replacements won

38:13.508 --> 38:15.249
the chili cook-off.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.207
- Ogle and McAuley?
- Uh-huh.

38:17.251 --> 38:20.080
- The worst!
Huh.

38:20.123 --> 38:23.213
- And I just realized
your hidden motivation

38:23.257 --> 38:25.999
for picking this shift
to vamoose.

38:26.913 --> 38:29.132
You don't like chili night.

38:29.176 --> 38:30.525
- Guilty.

38:30.569 --> 38:33.006
- Don't give firefighters
a bunch of beans

38:33.049 --> 38:34.660
and expect us to sleep
in the bunk room.

38:34.703 --> 38:35.661
- Yeah!

38:38.054 --> 38:43.930
- Oh, well, despite everything,

38:43.973 --> 38:46.672
I'm glad you guys came.

38:46.715 --> 38:49.065
It means a lot to me
to spend time together.

38:50.850 --> 38:53.200
- Brett.
- Partner.

38:55.115 --> 38:57.378
- Hmm.

38:57.422 --> 39:01.382
- Part of me thinks how crazy
it is that we were there

39:01.426 --> 39:06.474
in that moment
on that road at that time.

39:08.171 --> 39:10.130
And another part
of me thinks...

39:12.306 --> 39:15.440
Another part of me thinks
we were there for a reason.
