01:35.261 --> 01:36.262
<i>Hike!</i>

01:40.683 --> 01:42.685
<i>Look at
Gotham State 's Brian Rogers!</i>

01:42.810 --> 01:44.312
<i>He's a one-man offense.</i>

01:46.230 --> 01:49.066
<i>A repeat performance this weekend
against that tough Tech team,</i>

01:49.191 --> 01:52.445
<i>all but guarantees Rogers
a big-buck Pro contract.</i>

01:54.405 --> 01:57.074
Sounds like it's off to the Pros
for you, roommate.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.784
Maybe. But he's right.

01:58.909 --> 02:01.537
The scouts will be watching me
real close against Tech.

02:02.079 --> 02:03.789
Ah, no sweat. You'll dazzle them.

02:04.832 --> 02:06.000
I hope so.

02:06.083 --> 02:08.502
Making the Pros
means I can help out my folks.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.463
Maybe even put my sister
through college.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.132
<i>Time</i> for Boseman's Bloopers,

02:13.215 --> 02:15.384
<i>and boy, they were coming
off the walls this week.</i>

02:15.635 --> 02:19.055
<i>Heavily favored middleweight champ,
Rudy Lovell, set two new records.</i>

02:19.138 --> 02:21.057
<i>One for the shortest fight in history,</i>

02:21.182 --> 02:23.142
<i>the other for the 50-yard dash.</i>

02:23.225 --> 02:26.479
<i>Goalie, Rick Gale, came up
with a novel way to defend his goal.</i>

02:27.271 --> 02:30.358
<i>Rather unorthodox,
wouldn't you say, Rick? But effective.</i>

02:33.194 --> 02:34.528
<i>And here's top seed Chris Adams,</i>

02:34.654 --> 02:37.365
<i>making it look like
she's in the wrong racket.</i>

02:37.948 --> 02:40.493
<i>Seriously, though,
this was mighty puzzling behavior</i>

02:40.618 --> 02:42.453
<i>from some of our finest athletes.</i>

02:43.079 --> 02:44.080
I'll say.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.672
Telegram for Brian Rogers.

02:54.006 --> 02:56.342
- Uh, here you go.
- Good evening, gentlemen.

03:01.681 --> 03:02.765
This is weird.

03:03.307 --> 03:04.308
Let me see.

03:07.645 --> 03:10.064
"Dear Brian, best of luck against Tech.

03:10.481 --> 03:13.401
"And remember
that only a fool knows no fear.

03:13.984 --> 03:16.487
"I'm betting on it. A fan."

03:17.655 --> 03:18.864
As I said...

03:19.281 --> 03:20.408
- Weird.
- Weird.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.593
Hike! Hike!

03:43.973 --> 03:45.474
Yet another bad pass by Rogers.

03:46.517 --> 03:50.521
Brian Rogers is having the worst day
of his collegiate career.

03:51.605 --> 03:53.691
Come on, Brian, get it together.

03:57.361 --> 04:00.239
Uh, all right. All right.
Let's try a run.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.032
Off tackle.

04:02.158 --> 04:04.869
On third and 25, we need to pass!

04:05.661 --> 04:06.829
Yeah, okay, okay.

04:06.912 --> 04:08.205
Yeah, yeah, sure, pass.

04:08.664 --> 04:10.332
Are you okay, man?

04:11.167 --> 04:13.252
Yeah, yeah. No... No problem.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.883
The ball is snapped.
Rogers is going back.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.766
Ah! No!

04:26.849 --> 04:27.850
Don't hurt me!

04:27.933 --> 04:29.643
Don't hurt me!

04:44.158 --> 04:47.411
They were so big and scary.

04:48.162 --> 04:49.330
I couldn't...

04:49.789 --> 04:51.415
It's gonna be all right, son.

04:51.540 --> 04:54.502
We're gonna take you
to the infirmary for observation.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.383
It was unbelievable, Batman.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.261
The guy totally freaked,
right there on the field.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.680
Brian Rogers. The Rock.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.432
He was under a lot of pressure, Robin.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.810
You can never tell when--

05:21.612 --> 05:23.531
Uh-oh. Time to punch in.

05:36.293 --> 05:38.087
Oh, no. Not him!

05:38.170 --> 05:39.505
Come on. This way!

06:17.209 --> 06:18.460
He don't stop.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.672
That's because
he don't know when to quit!

06:34.560 --> 06:37.187
Robin, give me a hand.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.192
I can't.

06:42.818 --> 06:45.195
Hey, Batman, catch this!

06:50.784 --> 06:52.119
Ah!

07:16.852 --> 07:17.895
Oh, my!

07:24.276 --> 07:26.195
Oh, my.

07:33.410 --> 07:37.831
Hey, boy blunder, what's the matter?
Bat got your tongue?

07:40.334 --> 07:42.378
This will take care of bird boy.

07:58.894 --> 08:00.396
All right, Robin.

08:00.479 --> 08:01.772
Pull yourself together.

08:03.399 --> 08:04.984
I don't know what happened to me.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.735
I was scared to death.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.070
I couldn't even think.

08:08.153 --> 08:10.114
It was so unreal.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.123
It's too strange,
that both you and your roommate

08:19.206 --> 08:21.041
would have panic attacks
on the same day.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.210
I still can't believe it!

08:23.293 --> 08:24.878
I could've gotten you killed!

08:25.587 --> 08:27.047
Calm down.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.465
We'll get a lead on it.

08:37.766 --> 08:38.934
Did you see this?

08:40.185 --> 08:41.937
The screwy telegram?

08:42.021 --> 08:43.105
Sure.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.692
Hey, what's this?

08:46.775 --> 08:47.943
Our lead.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.369
Take it easy, fella.

09:03.792 --> 09:06.795
I suspect the chemical is absorbed
through the skin.

09:15.637 --> 09:17.765
- Nothing's happening.
- Yet.

09:29.610 --> 09:30.819
Just as I thought.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.868
The fear chemical
is activated by adrenaline.

09:37.951 --> 09:40.871
So whenever you or Brian
or any of the other athletes

09:40.954 --> 09:41.955
got agitated...

09:42.456 --> 09:45.876
The stuff kicks in,
turning our excitement to fear.

09:46.585 --> 09:48.629
But how long is this gonna last?

09:49.296 --> 09:51.757
I'm afraid there's only one person
who can answer that.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.593
The professor of fear himself.

09:54.676 --> 09:55.928
The Scarecrow.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.389
It can't be. He's locked up in Arkham.

10:01.308 --> 10:02.309
Isn't he?

10:28.752 --> 10:30.838
This is for Jonathan Crane.

10:30.921 --> 10:31.922
I got it!

10:33.257 --> 10:34.925
Hey, corn on the cob.

10:35.008 --> 10:37.636
A scarecrow's gotta love that.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.980
Has Professor Crane
lost his appetite?

10:53.819 --> 10:55.529
You're not supposed to be here.

10:55.612 --> 10:57.948
But the Scarecrow is.

10:58.031 --> 10:59.283
What...

10:59.366 --> 11:00.367
What do you mean?

11:00.450 --> 11:02.035
He's in his cell.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.954
I'd like to make sure of that.

11:04.037 --> 11:07.457
Take my word.
I just saw him five minutes ago.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.544
Then you won't mind
if I pay him a visit.

11:12.588 --> 11:13.714
No, you can't do that!

11:13.797 --> 11:15.924
It's against the rules! You can't!

11:21.388 --> 11:22.431
Stay with him, Robin.

11:23.557 --> 11:24.725
Fine with me.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.695
The cowl is familiar,

11:36.820 --> 11:38.280
but I'm blanking on the face.

11:56.423 --> 12:00.093
No! Don't go in! Don't do it! No!

12:02.763 --> 12:04.681
- Don't!
- Wait.

12:13.315 --> 12:14.733
Professor Crane?

12:27.913 --> 12:32.167
$27,800, $27,900, $28,000.

12:33.001 --> 12:35.128
It's a pleasure doing business.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.257
You've been winning
a lot here, Mr., uh...

12:40.300 --> 12:42.344
You may call me Lucky.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.972
Yeah? Well, Lucky,

12:45.055 --> 12:48.725
that's what you must be,
because I ain't seen you lose.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.436
Not even once over the last week.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.063
Yes, well,

12:53.146 --> 12:55.148
I make my own luck.

13:01.571 --> 13:03.323
That Lucky knows something,

13:03.407 --> 13:05.492
and I wanna know it, too.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.456
Be persuasive.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.099
Huh?

14:11.433 --> 14:12.976
Lost?

14:13.560 --> 14:16.104
You have that bewildered look,

14:16.188 --> 14:18.732
but your sort always does.

14:18.815 --> 14:21.234
I ain't lost. I'm looking for you.

14:21.318 --> 14:25.113
I wanna know
how come you always win, Mr. Lucky.

14:25.238 --> 14:27.449
It's quite simple, actually.

14:27.574 --> 14:29.493
I fix the games.

14:30.243 --> 14:33.955
You can't fix all those sports.
Nobody can.

14:35.082 --> 14:38.085
0 ye of little brain,
allow me to illustrate.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.422
Here. You can read, can't you?

14:48.261 --> 14:49.262
"BOO!"

14:49.346 --> 14:51.264
Hey, is this some kind of joke?

14:52.015 --> 14:54.351
It's no joke, I assure you.

14:54.434 --> 14:58.146
It's the fear of victory
and the agony of...

14:58.939 --> 15:00.690
The Scarecrow!

15:02.609 --> 15:08.281
So, now you understand step one
in how I fix an athletic contest.

15:08.365 --> 15:11.243
I shall proceed to step two.

15:11.326 --> 15:14.413
No! No! Get away!

15:24.840 --> 15:29.052
He's gonna get me. He's gonna get me.
He's gonna get me!

15:31.179 --> 15:34.766
That's how we found him.
Scared as a rat at a cat convention.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.852
I've never seen anything like it.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.728
You haven't been watching
the sports channel.

15:38.812 --> 15:39.938
Sports?

15:40.897 --> 15:42.357
Oh, you mean those athletes?

15:42.941 --> 15:46.236
- What's that got to do with...
- Put two and two together, Commissioner.

15:46.319 --> 15:49.072
That goon in there
works for Leon the bookie.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.323
And word has it,

15:50.407 --> 15:52.617
he's been taking it on the chin lately.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.996
You're telling me
that that walking pile of straw

15:56.079 --> 15:58.081
scares the stuffing out of sports stars,

15:58.165 --> 16:00.417
and then bets against their teams?

16:00.500 --> 16:01.543
Exactly.

16:01.626 --> 16:05.297
A perfect way to scare up
some quick cash for his sick schemes.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.013
Steady, Dick.

16:13.513 --> 16:14.764
You can do it.

16:18.268 --> 16:19.352
I'm not afraid!

16:20.145 --> 16:21.730
I'm not afraid!

16:21.813 --> 16:23.940
I'm not... No!

16:31.281 --> 16:33.575
I learned to walk on a high wire.

16:33.658 --> 16:36.703
Now I can't stand
on a step stool without freaking.

16:36.786 --> 16:37.871
I'm...

16:37.954 --> 16:39.539
I'm no good to you anymore.

16:40.457 --> 16:43.418
Easy, Dick.
It's bound to wear off.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.587
But, in the meantime,
you've got to fight it.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.297
Regain control.

16:47.380 --> 16:48.798
Come on.

16:48.882 --> 16:49.883
Where?

16:51.801 --> 16:53.720
I thought we'd
catch a game tonight.

16:53.803 --> 16:58.058
The Gotham Knights are favored 4-1,
thanks to their quarterback, Mitch Nole.

16:59.017 --> 17:02.062
You think he's
gonna get a telegram?

17:03.021 --> 17:04.356
I'd say it's a good bet.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.025
I don't know.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.277
I'll only get in the way.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.697
You can be my extra set of eyes. Get in.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.617
I'II drive real slow.

17:42.143 --> 17:43.728
Okay, Robin.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.689
Get it together.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.032
Telegram for Mitch Nole. Oh!

17:56.491 --> 17:59.119
What? What's wrong?
All I did was double-park!

17:59.202 --> 18:00.745
I'II move it! I swear!

18:44.039 --> 18:45.123
All right, Scarecrow.

18:45.957 --> 18:48.043
What's your game plan this time?

18:58.094 --> 18:59.095
Hut!

19:08.396 --> 19:11.066
Mitch Nole is
ripping the Colonials apart!

19:11.191 --> 19:14.277
Four hundred yards passing,
and the game's not over yet.

19:14.361 --> 19:17.739
There's enough powder in that helmet
to panic a pachyderm!

19:19.991 --> 19:20.992
Hut! Hut!

19:29.834 --> 19:33.046
He should be prostrating himself,
crying for mercy!

19:33.129 --> 19:35.090
Change of luck, Scarecrow?

19:36.549 --> 19:37.842
You!

19:37.926 --> 19:41.221
You're aware
that gambling is illegal in Gotham?

19:41.346 --> 19:43.348
I need the money, Batman.

19:43.431 --> 19:45.975
You know the cost
of chemicals these days.

19:46.101 --> 19:49.896
And it'll take much more than this
to bring every pathetic person in Gotham

19:49.979 --> 19:52.482
to their knees, kissing my feet!

19:53.233 --> 19:54.693
No closer, Batman!

19:54.776 --> 19:57.445
Unless you want a stampede
of half-crazed humanity,

19:57.529 --> 19:59.322
crushing and clawing each other!

20:00.156 --> 20:01.157
Oh, no!

20:06.162 --> 20:09.499
Come on, Robin. Get a grip!

20:15.797 --> 20:19.759
Now, what guarantee do I have
you won't follow me?

20:20.593 --> 20:22.137
You have my word, Scarecrow.

20:22.220 --> 20:24.389
Just don't drop the vial.

20:24.472 --> 20:27.934
Actually, Batman,
I'd prefer a little insurance

20:28.059 --> 20:30.270
that you'll be otherwise occupied.

21:02.010 --> 21:05.722
It's a fumble!
This could mean disaster for Gotham!

21:07.766 --> 21:09.350
Wait! Look at that!

21:13.354 --> 21:15.064
What a recovery!

21:19.694 --> 21:21.237
Good work, Robin.

21:23.990 --> 21:26.951
I also snagged a helmet
that had some of this in it.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.788
Looks like you've got a handle
on your problem.

21:29.871 --> 21:32.040
Yeah. I'm getting there.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.961
<i>The Gotham Knights
wasted no time signing Brian Rogers,</i>

21:37.045 --> 21:40.465
<i>making our local champ
their first-round draft pick.</i>

21:40.548 --> 21:43.009
Looks like your friend
is back on track again.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.470
Yeah, I can't wait to congratulate him.

21:45.553 --> 21:47.847
You can always send a telegram.

22:21.464 --> 22:22.465
English - SDH
