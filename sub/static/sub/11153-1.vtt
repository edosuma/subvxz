06:20.395 --> 06:22.226
Closing pressure valve.

06:23.231 --> 06:25.392
Hydraulic systems deactivated.

06:26.901 --> 06:28.562
Insulation cover open.

06:29.837 --> 06:31.099
Did you hear that?

06:31.172 --> 06:32.332
What?

06:33.341 --> 06:34.831
That. Did you hear that?

06:34.909 --> 06:36.240
No.

06:36.311 --> 06:38.142
Electrical system activated.

06:39.414 --> 06:40.676
There it is again.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.017
Procedure number six completed.

06:44.085 --> 06:46.349
Second memory bank access open.

06:49.257 --> 06:51.191
Professor, it's good
to see you again.

06:51.259 --> 06:53.193
- Good to see you, Major.
- Agents Wickett and Midford.

06:53.261 --> 06:54.751
- Professor.
- How do you do.

06:54.829 --> 06:58.196
Looks like we've got a malfunction
on the aft sampler feed.

06:58.266 --> 06:59.528
Try a reset.

06:59.601 --> 07:02.001
Doctor, remember Major Bradley,
head of intelligence.

07:02.070 --> 07:03.059
Major, how are you?

07:03.137 --> 07:05.867
Opening C-5 container now.

07:10.044 --> 07:11.739
Three full loads.

07:11.813 --> 07:13.678
The gross weight discrepancy's
still there.

07:13.748 --> 07:15.272
Recheck the pre-stat.

07:15.350 --> 07:17.682
I've given it the auto test.
I've given it the manual test.

07:17.752 --> 07:19.982
- It's still there.
- All right, let me see.

07:20.054 --> 07:22.545
Could you reset these
and give me one last...

07:30.298 --> 07:32.766
You see any
little green monsters in there?

07:35.703 --> 07:37.432
HMS samples look great.

07:40.608 --> 07:42.576
Section seven, closing down.

07:42.644 --> 07:45.977
Gross weight discrepancy's still there.
I've cross-checked everything.

07:47.081 --> 07:48.241
Let me see that.

07:49.917 --> 07:51.976
Changing codes on the function keys.

07:52.053 --> 07:54.317
Roger. Twenty megs left
in bank two memory.

07:56.324 --> 07:58.349
Opening aft sampler chamber.

07:58.426 --> 08:00.656
Pressure system in second mode.

08:00.728 --> 08:04.926
Eighth procedure completed.
Going to program nine.

08:09.070 --> 08:10.594
What happened?

08:13.374 --> 08:14.534
Seal it back up!

08:14.609 --> 08:16.042
What happened?

08:16.110 --> 08:19.409
I don't know!
I undid the panel and it blew!

08:19.480 --> 08:20.606
Come on, guys, shut it back!

08:20.682 --> 08:23.549
Look out!
There's something in there!

08:23.618 --> 08:26.086
- What the hell?
- Don't move! Don't move!

08:27.655 --> 08:29.748
Larry, back off.

08:29.824 --> 08:32.621
Back off, Larry. Get away from it.
Reverse the aft sampler.

08:33.594 --> 08:35.255
Back off! Back off!

08:36.097 --> 08:37.462
You okay?

08:37.532 --> 08:38.624
Yeah, I'm okay.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.793
Look out!
Get out of here! Come on!

08:40.868 --> 08:42.836
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

08:46.574 --> 08:48.667
Breakout, breakout.
We've got a problem here.

08:48.743 --> 08:49.903
Do you see anything?

08:49.977 --> 08:51.467
Pull back to second perimeter.

08:51.546 --> 08:55.380
Repeat, pull back to second perimeter.
We have a breakout here.

08:55.450 --> 08:56.610
Code Red.

08:59.387 --> 09:01.150
How many are there?

09:07.362 --> 09:08.727
Keep still. Don't move.

09:27.382 --> 09:30.215
Stay back.
Stay away from them.

09:51.139 --> 09:52.538
Open the doors to the left!

09:52.607 --> 09:54.074
Hey, to the right!

09:54.142 --> 09:55.541
Moving in!

10:01.516 --> 10:04.713
- Get ready!
- Wait! Hold your fire!

10:04.786 --> 10:06.253
- Stay back!
- Hold your fire!

10:06.320 --> 10:07.753
Everybody hold your fire!

10:13.094 --> 10:14.959
Roger. We see him.

10:15.029 --> 10:17.463
He's heading towards the north fence.

10:18.299 --> 10:20.790
Holy smoke!
What the hell is that?

10:23.004 --> 10:24.835
He's hung up on the fence!

10:35.349 --> 10:37.214
Look out!
It's on the windshield!

10:37.285 --> 10:39.378
Look out, Dad!

10:39.454 --> 10:41.649
We're gonna crash, Dad!

10:41.722 --> 10:44.714
Oh, no! Look out!

10:48.463 --> 10:49.623
Oh, my God!

10:51.732 --> 10:53.029
Look out!

10:54.635 --> 10:56.125
Look out!

11:03.744 --> 11:05.575
Stay here, okay?
You okay?

11:11.886 --> 11:14.377
A fire extinguisher!
Do you have a fire extinguisher?

11:14.455 --> 11:15.945
I've got one! I've got one!

11:16.023 --> 11:18.423
- Here!
- Get away, get away!

11:32.607 --> 11:34.768
Come on, that's it.

11:34.842 --> 11:37.003
Close your mouth.
Close your eyes.

11:37.078 --> 11:38.443
It's okay.

11:55.796 --> 11:57.127
Looks like a biggie.

11:57.198 --> 11:58.961
Mom, get in their lane,
follow 'em down.

11:59.033 --> 12:00.898
Will you guys just stop it?

12:00.968 --> 12:02.663
Can we get down and watch?

12:02.737 --> 12:04.227
No way.

12:04.305 --> 12:05.932
Is anybody hurt?

12:06.007 --> 12:08.999
Nothing serious, lady.
Something just ran across the road.

12:13.447 --> 12:15.438
I'm not crazy.
It looked like an omelet with two eyes.

12:15.516 --> 12:18.917
- It must've been some sort of alien.
- My dad, he's telling the truth...!

12:18.986 --> 12:20.385
Think it was a drunk?

12:20.454 --> 12:22.251
It's probably an ADUl.

12:22.323 --> 12:23.483
What?

12:23.558 --> 12:25.788
An alien driving under the influence.

12:30.264 --> 12:32.425
We need the paramedics here
when you get time.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.900
- It'll be midnight...
- Okay, bring it up, bring it up.

12:34.969 --> 12:36.664
It's gonna be backed up for hours.

12:36.737 --> 12:38.705
Good evening, miss.
Everything all right?

12:38.773 --> 12:40.798
- You tell me.
- This won't take a minute.

12:46.514 --> 12:48.004
All right, you can go.
Go on.

12:48.082 --> 12:51.518
Next car. Come on,
let's pull up. Quickly.

12:52.787 --> 12:54.618
Wonder what they were looking for?

12:55.456 --> 12:58.755
Omelets... with eyes.

13:00.227 --> 13:03.560
Wow! He jumped over two cars!

13:03.631 --> 13:05.963
And nobody got hurt?
Yeah, right.

13:06.033 --> 13:08.501
That car's flat! Jeez!

13:08.569 --> 13:11.003
Okay, give it back, Mike.

13:11.072 --> 13:12.061
What?

13:12.139 --> 13:14.835
- He took my Coke, Mom.
- Come on, you guys.

13:14.909 --> 13:16.570
I don't have it. I didn't take it.

13:17.578 --> 13:19.170
- I knew it!
- Gross!

13:19.246 --> 13:22.044
- That wasn't me.
- Who was it, then?

13:22.116 --> 13:24.846
- Mom...?
- It wasn't me!

13:24.919 --> 13:26.409
I'm onto you!

13:27.555 --> 13:29.045
Come on, Mike, give it back.

14:18.739 --> 14:20.639
- Mom.
- Thanks.

14:22.009 --> 14:23.840
Eric, wake up.
We're almost there.

14:24.912 --> 14:28.177
- Eric.
- All right.

14:31.085 --> 14:33.519
Hey, look at all the cars.

14:33.587 --> 14:35.646
This looks pretty nice.

14:35.723 --> 14:37.657
Pretty nice.

15:10.791 --> 15:12.816
- Great hill for the wheels, man.
- Yeah!

15:12.893 --> 15:15.885
No, you're not going down any hills
until we've checked it out, okay?

15:15.963 --> 15:17.294
I know, Mom.

15:17.364 --> 15:20.299
Okay, we're almost here.
Close your eyes, guys.

15:20.367 --> 15:21.356
Close 'em.

15:22.570 --> 15:24.231
There's a pretty girl.

15:24.305 --> 15:26.796
I said close 'em,
you cheaters.

15:26.874 --> 15:28.034
Come on.

15:28.109 --> 15:30.703
You guys are gonna love this place.

15:31.712 --> 15:34.272
Okay, you can open 'em.

15:36.083 --> 15:37.072
Kitty, kitty.

15:37.151 --> 15:38.675
Wow! Top of the hill!

15:38.753 --> 15:40.584
Cool, check it out!
Two-car garage!

15:40.654 --> 15:42.121
Yes, it's the chauffeur's day off!

15:42.189 --> 15:43.679
Can we afford this?

15:43.758 --> 15:46.750
No, we can't, Eric. That's why
I'm forced to sell your brother.

15:46.827 --> 15:48.317
Tough break, Mike.

15:48.395 --> 15:49.384
Hey!

15:50.531 --> 15:53.364
That's my stuff you're
throwing around there.

15:53.434 --> 15:56.232
Relax, lady.
It's just our furniture pads.

15:56.303 --> 15:57.827
Oh. Sorry.

15:59.006 --> 16:00.871
Bring the groceries in, guys, okay?

16:00.941 --> 16:03.102
- I like it.
- Me too.

16:03.177 --> 16:05.441
Hey, how's it going?

16:07.414 --> 16:09.644
We're communing
with the earth spirits.

16:11.252 --> 16:12.776
Right.

16:12.853 --> 16:16.152
- Welcome to California, bud.
- Really.

16:16.223 --> 16:17.281
Here.

16:18.859 --> 16:20.520
Aren't you gonna carry anything?

16:20.594 --> 16:22.755
Sure. I've got my skateboard.

16:22.830 --> 16:25.799
Let's go.
Hello, California women.

16:25.866 --> 16:29.097
Have no fear,
your hormonal hero is here.

16:45.252 --> 16:47.379
Oh, my...!

16:49.023 --> 16:51.514
- Great house, man.
- I can't see anything.

16:51.592 --> 16:53.423
Put the stuff
over on the table, guys.

16:53.494 --> 16:55.826
- You're gonna love it.
- The ceiling looks good.

16:55.896 --> 16:57.693
Yeah? Well, check it out.

16:57.765 --> 16:59.528
This is totally rad!

16:59.600 --> 17:01.966
Is this gonna get me a great
Mother's Day present or what?

17:02.036 --> 17:03.697
You really scored big, Mom.

17:03.771 --> 17:04.829
Look over here.

17:04.905 --> 17:06.770
Hey, is that all ours?

17:06.840 --> 17:08.832
Yeah, about the first
25 yards of it.

17:08.909 --> 17:11.707
You think there's any
wild animals out there?

17:11.779 --> 17:13.973
Definitely, definitely.
Some big grizzly bears.

17:14.048 --> 17:15.481
There's probably some deer up here.

17:15.549 --> 17:18.313
- Alligators, big nasty ones.
- Are you guys kidding?

17:18.385 --> 17:22.878
Maybe a couple of gorillas.
Maybe a werewolf.

17:22.957 --> 17:24.356
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, Mom, where's my room?

17:24.425 --> 17:26.222
It's down the hall.

17:26.292 --> 17:28.056
Watch the door.

17:29.563 --> 17:33.795
Did you notice, my dear, that there is
not one step in the entire place?

17:33.868 --> 17:35.267
Low counters.

17:35.336 --> 17:37.031
Wide hallways.

17:37.104 --> 17:39.231
And you can see
out of every window.

17:39.306 --> 17:41.672
And, baby, you ain't
seen nothing yet!

17:50.584 --> 17:51.573
Okay?

17:51.652 --> 17:55.247
It's great! You see the size of these
closets? I'm gonna need more clothes!

17:55.322 --> 17:57.051
Yeah, we'll put you on the list.

17:57.124 --> 17:58.113
Thanks.

18:03.697 --> 18:04.857
What do you think, huh?

18:04.932 --> 18:06.422
I thought we'd put the bed over here.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.092
That way you just wake up
every morning

18:08.168 --> 18:09.726
and see the sun coming
over the mountains.

18:09.803 --> 18:11.134
You did great, Mom.

18:11.205 --> 18:12.934
Thank you.

18:38.999 --> 18:40.489
Want some lunch?

18:40.567 --> 18:42.535
No thanks. I'm fine.

18:42.603 --> 18:43.592
Okay.

20:18.399 --> 20:21.391
Your mom said this is your TV.
You want me to hook it up for you?

20:21.468 --> 20:23.698
No, I can handle it.
Just put it down over there.

20:23.771 --> 20:24.931
You got it.

20:38.318 --> 20:41.048
There's Tooter Shellby on Sea SnaiI,

20:41.121 --> 20:43.351
Or is it the other way around?

20:46.994 --> 20:49.360
Casey Kelp on Clamdancer,

20:49.430 --> 20:52.024
Junior Wetworth riding Snorkaway,

20:54.802 --> 20:57.498
And Allstar Seaworthy
atop Seabiscuit,

20:59.073 --> 21:00.597
They're all in line,

21:00.674 --> 21:02.073
Here's your TOW.

21:02.142 --> 21:03.131
What?

21:03.210 --> 21:04.643
Tuna on whole wheat.

21:04.711 --> 21:06.975
Oh. Thanks.
Hey, come look at this.

21:07.047 --> 21:09.345
...Allstar Seaworthy,
grabbing an early lead,

21:09.416 --> 21:10.405
Thattaboy...

21:12.086 --> 21:13.417
That's very good.

21:13.487 --> 21:16.115
It didn't do that last time.
It stayed on.

21:18.992 --> 21:22.257
Yeah, well, if it happens again,
let me know.

21:27.334 --> 21:30.064
And as they approach
the home stretch...

23:14.474 --> 23:15.463
Hi.

23:16.577 --> 23:19.239
- Hi.
- You looking for your friend?

23:19.313 --> 23:20.473
Yeah!

23:20.547 --> 23:22.014
He went down the hill.

23:22.082 --> 23:23.549
Did you get
a good look at him?

23:23.617 --> 23:25.175
Yeah, he's real cute.

23:25.252 --> 23:27.083
What did he look like?

23:27.154 --> 23:30.146
He's your friend, and you don't even
know what he looks like?

23:30.224 --> 23:32.886
I was just kidding.
He's my brother.

23:32.960 --> 23:36.327
Your brother?
Where are you from?

23:36.396 --> 23:37.420
lllinois.

23:37.497 --> 23:39.465
Welcome to the neighborhood.

23:39.533 --> 23:41.899
Looks like you'll be
an interesting addition.

23:41.969 --> 23:43.459
Hey, Deb, time to eat.

23:43.537 --> 23:44.526
Okay.

23:44.605 --> 23:46.664
I've got to go.
What's your name?

23:46.740 --> 23:47.764
Eric.

23:47.841 --> 23:50.002
I'm Debbie.
This is my sister Courtney.

23:50.077 --> 23:51.669
- Hi.
- Hl.

23:51.745 --> 23:53.872
- We'll talk later.
- Okay.

23:53.947 --> 23:56.040
- See ya.
- Bye.

23:56.116 --> 23:58.050
What happened in here?

23:58.118 --> 23:59.551
Did you just go down the hill?

23:59.620 --> 24:00.609
No.

24:00.687 --> 24:02.518
Mom is gonna freak out.

24:02.589 --> 24:04.648
There's something weird going on.

24:04.725 --> 24:06.886
- Look at this.
- What?

24:06.960 --> 24:08.894
There were footprints here.

24:08.962 --> 24:11.328
Somebody was just in my bathroom
taking a shower.

24:11.398 --> 24:13.730
Yeah, right. You think she's
gonna go for that, huh?

24:13.800 --> 24:15.131
I'm serious.

24:15.202 --> 24:17.500
The TV went on, and it
wasn't even plugged in.

24:18.905 --> 24:20.805
I'm not joking, Michael.

24:20.874 --> 24:22.364
Who broke the lamp?

24:22.442 --> 24:25.036
Well, Sherlock Holmes here
thinks he saw a ghost.

24:25.112 --> 24:26.306
Did the ghost do it?

24:26.380 --> 24:29.713
Something was just in my bedroom.
It jumped over my head.

24:29.783 --> 24:32.445
- Yeah, right.
- What thing?

24:32.519 --> 24:35.147
I never saw it.
It just kept doing things.

24:35.222 --> 24:38.191
I'm not lying, Mom.
I swear it.

25:22.402 --> 25:25.098
Right. I've got something better
for the fireplace, anyway.

25:25.172 --> 25:26.833
It's Harvey!

25:26.907 --> 25:30.900
What did you dress that thing up in?
Give it to me. It's horrible!

26:00.073 --> 26:02.906
Eric... you asleep?

26:18.392 --> 26:21.589
Now, come on. I want you
to stop worrying about this.

26:21.661 --> 26:23.526
Did you lock all the windows?

26:23.597 --> 26:26.623
- Yes.
- Good.

26:26.700 --> 26:30.466
I was thinking maybe it wasn't
such a bad thing, anyway.

26:30.537 --> 26:33.700
All it did was take a shower
and drink a soda.

26:34.641 --> 26:36.973
Maybe it was one of
the neighborhood kids or something.

26:37.043 --> 26:39.375
I'm sure there's
a rational explanation.

26:40.747 --> 26:43.045
Come on, try and get
some sleep, huh?

26:43.116 --> 26:44.606
It's been a long day.

28:03.997 --> 28:05.225
Michael?

30:19.699 --> 30:20.859
Oh, my God!

30:29.943 --> 30:33.606
Michael, Eric,
what have you done?

30:33.680 --> 30:35.113
I didn't do it, Mom.

30:35.181 --> 30:36.876
Oh, my...

30:36.950 --> 30:39.544
Oh, this is my mother's painting!

30:39.619 --> 30:41.519
It's a hundred years old!

30:41.588 --> 30:43.556
Whoa! What happened in here?

30:44.557 --> 30:46.218
Everything's ruined!

30:46.292 --> 30:47.884
It's totally ruined!

30:47.961 --> 30:50.521
It wasn't me, Mom! It was
the little creature! I saw it!

30:50.597 --> 30:53.691
The house is totally destroyed!

30:53.767 --> 30:57.032
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't want you to say anything!

30:57.103 --> 30:58.468
Well, calm down, Mom.

30:58.538 --> 31:01.371
This is incredible. It's insane.
I don't believe it.

31:01.441 --> 31:03.932
Look at this. Oh, my God.
I'm going back to bed.

31:04.678 --> 31:06.145
What the heck happened, man?

32:30.830 --> 32:32.058
Eric!

32:37.203 --> 32:39.728
Stop it, Eric, stop!

32:46.412 --> 32:47.401
Eric!

32:49.649 --> 32:51.480
Oh, my gosh!

32:51.551 --> 32:53.246
Eric!

32:54.320 --> 32:55.309
Eric!

32:55.388 --> 32:57.720
Come on, Eric, swim!

32:58.725 --> 33:01.455
Swim to the side, Eric! Swim!

33:01.528 --> 33:03.496
Mom! Mom!

33:04.564 --> 33:06.657
Swim! Swim, Eric!

33:08.368 --> 33:11.360
No! Eric!

33:14.908 --> 33:16.102
What is it?

33:17.110 --> 33:18.509
Eric!

33:37.463 --> 33:41.160
Eric, look at me!
Say something!

33:41.234 --> 33:42.724
Did you see him?

33:42.802 --> 33:43.791
What?

33:43.870 --> 33:45.201
The little creature!

33:45.271 --> 33:46.932
I can't believe he did this.

33:47.006 --> 33:48.667
He's all right, Mom.
I'll go get him.

33:48.741 --> 33:51.232
No, no. Just go
and get some help.

33:52.812 --> 33:55.178
2-17, paramedics on the way,

33:59.385 --> 34:02.513
I don't know why he did it.
I just saw him go.

34:02.589 --> 34:05.922
Deep breath? Good.

34:05.992 --> 34:06.981
One more.

34:08.061 --> 34:09.722
Oh, fine. Now sit back.

34:10.730 --> 34:12.391
- How's your head feel?
- Fine.

34:12.465 --> 34:13.659
No dizziness?

34:13.733 --> 34:15.893
I want you to follow this
with your eyes.

34:16.902 --> 34:17.891
Good.

34:17.971 --> 34:19.233
Once more.

34:20.406 --> 34:21.565
Fine.

34:21.641 --> 34:23.505
You're a lucky young man.

34:23.576 --> 34:25.168
Everything seems to be okay.

34:26.246 --> 34:27.907
Could you leave us
alone for a minute?

34:33.920 --> 34:36.650
Your mother tells me that
you've been seeing some things.

34:37.790 --> 34:38.949
Can you tell me about it?

34:40.025 --> 34:41.789
You wouldn't believe it.

34:41.860 --> 34:42.918
Try me.

34:45.764 --> 34:47.426
It's a little creature.

34:48.601 --> 34:50.091
Do you see him often?

34:50.168 --> 34:52.603
Just the things that he does.

34:52.672 --> 34:54.697
Has anyone else
seen this little creature?

34:54.774 --> 34:56.764
Just Debbie.
She's the girl next door.

34:58.578 --> 35:01.570
I'm going to give you
this mild sedative.

35:01.648 --> 35:03.047
It'll help you get some rest.

35:03.116 --> 35:06.449
Why don't you just ask Debbie?
She knows all about it.

35:06.519 --> 35:08.043
Here, you take this.

35:09.589 --> 35:11.921
And we'll discuss all that later, okay?

35:15.895 --> 35:17.226
You get that rest.

35:18.531 --> 35:20.021
I'll come back to see you soon.

35:26.406 --> 35:28.465
He's not your brother, is he?

35:28.541 --> 35:30.771
Why didn't you tell them
that you saw him?

35:30.843 --> 35:32.970
Because nobody would believe it.

35:33.046 --> 35:35.105
What is he, some sort of ghost?

35:35.181 --> 35:36.648
I don't know what he is.

35:36.716 --> 35:38.479
You should have backed me up.

35:38.551 --> 35:40.382
It wouldn't do any good.

35:40.453 --> 35:42.717
They only believe
what they want to believe.

35:42.789 --> 35:45.189
They already think
you've got schizo-freakia.

35:45.258 --> 35:47.123
Schizo what?

35:47.193 --> 35:48.490
Freakia.

35:48.561 --> 35:50.859
It's when you see people
that really aren't there.

35:50.930 --> 35:53.660
Well, I'm gonna prove it to everyone.

35:53.733 --> 35:55.701
I'm gonna catch him.

35:55.768 --> 35:57.326
Can I come in?

35:57.403 --> 35:58.495
Sure.

35:59.806 --> 36:01.239
Sorry to hear what happened.

36:01.307 --> 36:02.604
You look okay.

36:02.675 --> 36:03.937
I'm fine.

36:04.010 --> 36:05.705
Mom wants to go, Deb.

36:05.778 --> 36:08.144
Okay. I'll see you later.

36:08.214 --> 36:09.806
Give me a call.

36:10.883 --> 36:14.216
Hey, why don't you invite Eric
to Brittany's birthday tomorrow.

36:14.287 --> 36:16.380
- You want to come?
- Sure.

36:16.456 --> 36:17.889
Okay, I'll see you then.

36:17.957 --> 36:20.016
Bye. I'm glad you're okay.

36:20.093 --> 36:21.082
Bye.

36:23.396 --> 36:24.886
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:24.964 --> 36:26.727
I'm Michael, Eric's brother.

36:26.799 --> 36:28.699
I'm Courtney, Deb's sister.

36:28.768 --> 36:30.827
- Yeah.
- Nice meeting you.

36:30.903 --> 36:31.892
Me too.

36:32.872 --> 36:35.705
- McDonald's, huh?
- Yeah.

36:35.775 --> 36:38.642
Why don't you stop by
for a Big Mac?

36:38.711 --> 36:40.235
Let's go.

36:43.249 --> 36:45.183
You never told me about her.

36:52.992 --> 36:55.222
I knew I shouldn't have
taken this job right now.

36:55.294 --> 36:57.159
Mom, it's gonna be fine.

36:57.230 --> 36:59.528
Are you getting a draft?

36:59.599 --> 37:00.827
I'm rolling up the window.

37:00.900 --> 37:02.390
You should be in bed, anyway.

37:02.468 --> 37:04.333
- I'm fine.
- Michael!

37:04.404 --> 37:06.770
Hey, look out, you idiot!

37:06.839 --> 37:08.500
I saw it, Mom.
I had plenty of room.

37:08.574 --> 37:10.735
What is the matter with you today?

37:11.711 --> 37:14.043
I'm gonna have to hire somebody
to take care of you guys.

37:14.113 --> 37:16.707
- I can be on my own, Mom.
- That's it. Not if I can help it.

37:16.783 --> 37:18.944
Debbie's mom said
she could look after him.

37:19.018 --> 37:21.248
Okay, we're here.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.480
I should have called in sick.

37:22.555 --> 37:24.853
You can't call in sick
on your first day.

37:24.924 --> 37:26.482
Are you gonna be okay?

37:26.559 --> 37:27.787
Guaranteed.

37:27.860 --> 37:30.385
Listen, I'm getting out at nine.
Mr. Allen is bringing me home.

37:30.463 --> 37:33.330
- Please be there, guys.
- We'll be there, Mom.

37:34.333 --> 37:35.595
I'm not ready for this.

37:35.668 --> 37:37.829
Mom, relax.
You've already got the job.

37:37.904 --> 37:40.168
- You look great.
- Thanks.

37:41.674 --> 37:43.665
Never seen her this tense before.

37:43.743 --> 37:46.234
Yeah, well, it's her first job
in ten years.

37:46.312 --> 37:48.780
- You know what I feel like?
- A Big Mac?

37:48.848 --> 37:51.373
- The man is a genius.
- I'm psychic!

37:51.451 --> 37:52.816
I tell ya!

39:00.920 --> 39:03.388
That's over, though.
She's back in Indiana.

39:03.456 --> 39:04.753
I'm here, she's there.

39:06.192 --> 39:08.524
Well, you know,
that doesn't really matter.

39:08.594 --> 39:11.654
So... let's talk about you.
Are you dating anyone?

39:13.466 --> 39:14.626
Good.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.099
What are you doing right now?

39:17.203 --> 39:19.398
Oh. What subject?

39:19.472 --> 39:23.841
Oh, that's sort of my subject.
I can help you if you want some help.

39:23.910 --> 39:25.138
Come on over.

40:05.818 --> 40:07.479
What are you doing here?

40:08.487 --> 40:10.318
- Did you catch him?
- Not yet.

40:10.389 --> 40:12.880
- I want to help.
- What about your mom?

40:12.959 --> 40:15.427
I'm not going to tell her.
Who's that?

40:15.494 --> 40:18.930
It's just my old
Chicago Cubs mascot.

40:18.998 --> 40:21.796
Here, you can carry
the equipment. Put this on.

40:22.868 --> 40:24.460
What are we going to do?

40:24.537 --> 40:26.004
It's just a precaution.

40:26.072 --> 40:28.233
I think you should know I bruise easily.

40:39.318 --> 40:41.718
Get those cords! Come on!

40:41.787 --> 40:44.620
You still haven't told me
what we're going to do.

40:44.690 --> 40:47.158
Here, strap this vacuum cleaner
on your back.

40:47.226 --> 40:48.887
We're gonna suck him up.

40:57.536 --> 40:59.663
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

41:35.308 --> 41:36.366
You ready?

41:39.312 --> 41:40.472
Hit it.

41:41.881 --> 41:43.610
Charge!

41:45.217 --> 41:48.209
You got him!
Don't hurt him!

41:48.287 --> 41:50.380
You're hurting him!

41:50.456 --> 41:51.889
We got him!

41:52.458 --> 41:55.120
Get me off of this thing!

41:55.194 --> 41:56.183
Debbie!

42:03.002 --> 42:03.991
Michael!

42:08.374 --> 42:10.604
Hey! What's going on?

42:12.611 --> 42:15.045
Get me off of this thing!

42:16.082 --> 42:17.845
Turn it off! Stop it!

42:21.721 --> 42:22.710
Get this off of me!

42:22.788 --> 42:25.723
- Are you okay?
- Would you get me off of here?

42:25.791 --> 42:27.759
I think I'm gonna throw up.

42:27.827 --> 42:30.227
Would somebody please tell me
what is happening?

42:30.296 --> 42:31.593
He's in the vacuum.

42:31.664 --> 42:33.222
What? What are you
talking about?

42:33.299 --> 42:35.199
It's the thing I've been
telling you about-the MAC.

42:35.267 --> 42:36.256
What?

42:36.335 --> 42:38.326
The Mysterious Alien Creature.

42:38.404 --> 42:40.634
You've got to get him
out of there.

42:40.706 --> 42:42.037
Plug it back in.

42:42.108 --> 42:43.507
Wait, what are you gonna do?

42:43.576 --> 42:46.704
Just do it.
I'm gonna reverse the motor.

43:32.758 --> 43:34.248
Get me a drink.

43:43.102 --> 43:45.366
We hurt him bad, didn't we?

43:45.438 --> 43:46.735
It's okay.

43:46.806 --> 43:48.740
He looks tired.

43:51.177 --> 43:54.010
This is unreal.
This is incredible, guys.

43:54.079 --> 43:57.014
This must be like what they drink
on their own planet.

43:57.082 --> 43:58.777
Where'd he come from?

43:58.851 --> 43:59.977
I don't know.

44:00.052 --> 44:04.148
He came in the van with you.
I saw him when you first got here.

44:04.223 --> 44:06.953
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I thought you knew.

44:07.026 --> 44:10.393
Wait a minute. This is what they
were looking for back at the accident.

44:10.463 --> 44:11.623
That's Mom.

44:11.697 --> 44:13.597
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna tell her.

44:13.666 --> 44:17.625
Don't tell her about me, please!
My mom will go crazy!

44:17.703 --> 44:20.137
Okay, split, Debbie. Go!

44:21.707 --> 44:23.436
I'm sorry we set you up.

44:23.509 --> 44:25.272
I'll see you later.

44:30.149 --> 44:31.741
There must be a power failure.

44:31.817 --> 44:33.375
What happened?
All our lights are out.

44:37.823 --> 44:40.155
It's okay. It's just my mom!

44:40.226 --> 44:41.284
Come back!

44:42.294 --> 44:43.386
What's going on?

44:44.263 --> 44:46.424
Power's surging
in the whole neighborhood.

44:47.500 --> 44:49.161
- Michael?
- Yeah.

44:49.235 --> 44:50.293
Is everything okay?

44:50.369 --> 44:52.200
Fine, but you'd better
come look at something.

44:52.271 --> 44:53.704
What's the matter?
Where's Eric?

44:53.772 --> 44:55.865
- Where is he?
- He's fine. He's over here.

44:55.941 --> 44:58.375
What are you doing on the floor?
What is all this smoke?

44:58.444 --> 45:00.105
He ran off again!

45:00.179 --> 45:02.647
It's Eric's friend, Mom, the one
he's been trying to tell us about.

45:02.715 --> 45:04.876
They caught him in the vacuum cleaner.

45:04.950 --> 45:07.180
- "They"?
- We.

45:08.554 --> 45:11.079
Okay, let's start from
the beginning again, shall we?

45:11.156 --> 45:14.182
- Can I have my chair first, please?
- Go get him his chair.

45:14.260 --> 45:18.390
I sucked him up in the vacuum
to prove to everyone that he exists.

45:18.464 --> 45:20.989
He's not lying, Mom.
I saw it.

45:22.735 --> 45:26.899
You sucked this living thing
into a vacuum cleaner?

45:26.972 --> 45:29.270
Yeah, and then
we blew him out again!

45:29.341 --> 45:30.740
It's the truth, Mom.

45:30.809 --> 45:32.572
No, I can handle it.

45:33.579 --> 45:35.706
I can, really.
I can handle it.

45:56.936 --> 45:57.925
Morning.

46:04.543 --> 46:07.137
Strange-looking pets
in this neighborhood.

47:06.805 --> 47:09.797
Mike! Hey, Mike, wake up.
Looks like he came back.

47:09.875 --> 47:12.275
- Who?
- The little creature. Come on!

47:12.344 --> 47:13.538
Ah, cool!

47:15.014 --> 47:17.346
Wow! He cleaned up everything!

47:18.884 --> 47:19.873
Wow!

47:19.952 --> 47:22.352
- You think he did it?
- Hey, I sure didn't.

47:22.421 --> 47:24.252
Check out the door!

47:24.323 --> 47:26.052
Glad we didn't kill
the little dude!

47:26.125 --> 47:29.458
Yeah, he even fixed Mom's old painting.
And look at the ceiling!

47:29.528 --> 47:32.622
Hey, we should rent this guy out.
We'd be millionaires!

47:32.698 --> 47:34.928
Look at this.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.160
What is it?

47:36.235 --> 47:38.499
I don't know. Looks like
he's trying to tell us something.

47:38.570 --> 47:40.834
I bet it's got something to do
with where he came from.

47:40.906 --> 47:43.739
A Wickes Furniture store?
And what about these?

47:43.809 --> 47:45.504
Maybe he likes horses.

47:45.577 --> 47:49.411
This is incredible.
I don't believe it.

47:51.450 --> 47:54.112
Thanks, you guys.
I really appreciate it.

47:55.187 --> 47:57.553
We didn't do it, Mom.
He came back.

47:57.623 --> 48:01.787
Come on. Are you telling me this thing
came in and cleaned up the house?

48:01.860 --> 48:04.454
Think about it-
would we do something like this?

48:07.232 --> 48:08.893
That's a good point.

48:09.535 --> 48:12.197
He left these. We think it's
some kind of message.

48:12.271 --> 48:15.468
It's that thing they were looking for
back at the crash site, I'm telling you.

48:15.541 --> 48:17.668
It's an alien, like the guy said.

48:19.545 --> 48:21.536
You still don't believe us, do you?

48:23.382 --> 48:24.906
Come on, guys.

48:26.118 --> 48:29.952
I believe there's something,
but the question is what.

50:12.925 --> 50:15.018
Come on, Mom, let's go!

50:17.329 --> 50:19.695
- How far do you want to go?
- How about to the next driveway?

50:19.765 --> 50:22.461
Come on, let's go down
to the bottom of the hill and back.

50:22.534 --> 50:24.661
Okay. I'm gonna beat you.

50:24.736 --> 50:26.226
Wanna make a bet?

50:31.276 --> 50:34.211
Good dogs. Good dogs.
Stay where you are.

50:35.280 --> 50:36.269
Come on.

50:44.857 --> 50:47.348
Eric! Eric!

50:49.027 --> 50:50.688
I don't think he saw me.

50:54.633 --> 50:56.191
What is that?

50:57.269 --> 50:58.668
Don't hit him!

50:58.737 --> 51:00.796
What is he, crazy or something?

51:03.709 --> 51:07.645
What was that? I've never
seen anything like it.

53:18.076 --> 53:20.067
Get your shoes on.
We've got to go.

53:21.079 --> 53:22.068
Anything?

53:22.948 --> 53:25.007
Maybe he went to haunt
somebody else.

53:25.083 --> 53:27.074
That's not even funny, Mom.

53:27.152 --> 53:28.141
Sorry.

53:30.922 --> 53:31.911
Hello.

53:33.258 --> 53:34.520
Yeah, he's ready.

53:35.560 --> 53:36.720
Okay. Bye-bye.

53:37.929 --> 53:39.988
Eric, that was Debbie.
She's on her way.

53:40.065 --> 53:41.896
- You ready?
- Yeah.

53:42.968 --> 53:45.129
Gonna have a good time
at the party today?

53:48.140 --> 53:50.040
- Did you remember to lock the back?
- Yeah, I got it.

53:50.108 --> 53:51.268
Water and Power, ma'am.

53:51.343 --> 53:54.437
We're looking into last night's blackout.
Can we check your power boxes?

53:54.513 --> 53:55.946
Sure.
They're around the back.

53:56.014 --> 53:57.845
Thanks. It'll just take a minute.

53:57.916 --> 54:02.046
Mrs. Cruise, did you notice
anything unusual last night?

54:02.120 --> 54:03.451
Like what?

54:03.522 --> 54:05.387
What were you doing
when the blackout occurred?

54:05.457 --> 54:07.948
- I was driving up the street.
- I see.

54:08.026 --> 54:09.015
Thank you.

54:09.828 --> 54:13.286
Mom, that's the guy from the crash
in the desert. Don't you recognize him?

54:13.365 --> 54:16.493
Remember? He was the one
looking in all the cars.

54:16.568 --> 54:18.126
Doesn't it seem a little weird?

54:18.203 --> 54:19.830
- Hi.
- Hi, Debbie.

54:19.905 --> 54:21.896
My Mom wants to leave
in five minutes.

54:21.973 --> 54:24.237
Okay, fine. Come on,
we've got to go.

54:24.309 --> 54:26.869
I'll pick you up
at the party later.

54:26.945 --> 54:29.277
Don't forget the present
I left for you on the table.

54:29.347 --> 54:31.542
And call me. I want to
know what's going on.

54:35.787 --> 54:38.085
So what happened?
Where is he?

54:39.424 --> 54:40.982
Come on.

54:51.269 --> 54:52.759
It's here.

54:52.838 --> 54:54.965
Get Rankin
and the capture group up here.

54:55.040 --> 54:56.769
This is 100 X-Ray.

54:56.842 --> 54:58.810
Think they followed you here?

54:58.877 --> 55:00.504
I don't know.

55:00.579 --> 55:02.308
I bet they're looking for him.

55:03.215 --> 55:05.547
Maybe that's why
he's so scared.

55:08.720 --> 55:10.915
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

55:13.892 --> 55:15.826
What's all this stuff-

55:15.894 --> 55:17.885
straws and flowers?

55:17.963 --> 55:19.487
I don't know.

55:19.564 --> 55:21.122
And there they go!

55:21.199 --> 55:22.666
And it's Allstar Seaworthy...

55:22.734 --> 55:23.723
Eric!

55:27.706 --> 55:30.641
He doesn't look so good.

55:31.710 --> 55:33.041
Get that drink.

55:34.746 --> 55:36.771
What's the matter with him?

55:36.848 --> 55:38.782
I don't know.

55:38.850 --> 55:40.715
Here, you want some?

55:44.022 --> 55:46.081
He looks depressed or something.

55:48.894 --> 55:50.384
You have a family?

55:52.364 --> 55:55.356
- Oh, my gosh, there's three of them.
- Three?

55:55.433 --> 55:57.025
Ask him where he came from.

55:57.102 --> 55:58.831
How am I gonna do that?

55:58.904 --> 56:00.235
Wait a second.

56:03.542 --> 56:05.373
Your family here?

56:07.646 --> 56:09.705
He's pointing to my school.

56:10.782 --> 56:14.149
Oh, my gosh, that's my mom!
What are we going to do?

56:14.219 --> 56:16.016
You'll have to go without me.

56:16.087 --> 56:19.022
She won't do that. She's supposed
to be looking after you.

56:19.090 --> 56:21.081
We can't leave him here like this.

56:21.159 --> 56:22.922
You have to go, Eric.

56:22.994 --> 56:24.859
Tell her I'll be there
in a minute.

56:24.930 --> 56:28.161
- What are you going to do?
- Just go and tell her.

56:28.233 --> 56:30.064
Okay.

56:30.135 --> 56:32.501
Bye! I'll see you later!

56:35.907 --> 56:37.932
It's not safe here anymore.

56:38.009 --> 56:39.772
You have to come with me.

56:39.844 --> 56:40.936
Please.

56:41.012 --> 56:43.173
I won't let anybody hurt you.

57:10.665 --> 57:12.326
What is he doing in there?

57:13.001 --> 57:16.198
I think he was changing
steering wheels on his wheelchair.

57:16.771 --> 57:20.036
Debbie, wheelchairs
don't have a steering wheel.

57:21.176 --> 57:23.167
Maybe it was a flat tire.

57:24.245 --> 57:25.906
Maybe I'd better go help him.

57:25.981 --> 57:27.073
I'll do it.

57:28.216 --> 57:30.582
Oh, no!

57:32.354 --> 57:35.016
Kinda old for a teddy,
isn't he?

57:35.090 --> 57:37.251
He's from lllinois.

57:39.628 --> 57:41.118
Sorry it took so long.

57:41.196 --> 57:42.959
That's okay.
So, how do we do this?

57:43.031 --> 57:45.795
My wheelchair can fit in back,
and I'll sit in front.

57:45.867 --> 57:46.856
Sounds good.

57:47.869 --> 57:49.860
Here, take him. Go.

57:52.207 --> 57:55.108
All right, here we go.

58:00.181 --> 58:01.546
Sit down.

58:04.185 --> 58:05.652
Are you crazy?

58:05.720 --> 58:07.688
There's no way you're gonna
get away with this.

58:07.756 --> 58:11.089
I had to do something with him.
Keep him quiet.

58:15.497 --> 58:17.158
Sit still.

58:18.333 --> 58:19.925
Okay.

58:21.036 --> 58:23.527
Everybody fasten your seatbelts.

58:24.105 --> 58:25.265
Let's go.

58:32.514 --> 58:35.711
- Well, what do you think?
- Follow them.

59:00.608 --> 59:04.100
This is J-3. We're traveling
east on Valley Vista.

59:04.179 --> 59:06.010
Tell them to stand by.

59:11.820 --> 59:13.481
Don't.

59:13.555 --> 59:15.716
So, Eric, how long
have you two been together?

59:16.725 --> 59:18.818
She means the teddy, Eric.

59:18.893 --> 59:20.588
Oh, a long time.

59:22.664 --> 59:25.155
- Keep still.
- Does your bear move?

59:25.233 --> 59:29.829
Oh, yeah. He's one of those
new computerized kind.

59:29.904 --> 59:32.304
But I thought you said
you had him a long time.

59:32.373 --> 59:35.740
I have.
He just got new microchips.

59:38.546 --> 59:39.535
Amazing.

01:00:37.438 --> 01:00:38.530
What's in here?

01:00:41.643 --> 01:00:43.873
Hi, Brittany! Happy birthday!

01:00:43.945 --> 01:00:45.572
Thank you.

01:00:45.647 --> 01:00:47.239
This is my friend Eric.

01:00:47.315 --> 01:00:48.680
- Hi, Eric.
- Hi.

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:50.047
He's cute.

01:00:51.619 --> 01:00:53.951
Hiya. How's it going?

01:00:54.022 --> 01:00:55.785
- It's going.
- Nice teddy bear.

01:00:57.192 --> 01:00:58.955
Hi, Eric, how ya feelin'?

01:00:59.027 --> 01:01:00.551
Have you seen my brother yet?

01:01:00.628 --> 01:01:02.118
He'll be here soon.

01:01:08.036 --> 01:01:11.164
- No, Mac, give me that.
- Did you see that?

01:01:11.239 --> 01:01:15.403
- There's something in there.
- I don't believe it! Freaky!

01:01:16.411 --> 01:01:18.811
Lookit, honey, we're leaving, okay?

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.405
I'm gonna go, and I'll leave
Courtney here to watch you

01:01:21.482 --> 01:01:23.143
until Michael gets here, okay?

01:01:23.218 --> 01:01:26.585
Boy, that teddy is amazing!
I'll see you.

01:01:26.654 --> 01:01:27.643
Bye-bye.

01:01:31.593 --> 01:01:32.753
Happy birthday!

01:01:32.827 --> 01:01:36.092
Okay, kids, let's get
this dance contest going!

01:01:36.164 --> 01:01:37.358
- He's here!
- What?

01:01:37.432 --> 01:01:40.424
- Mac! He's in the teddy suit.
- He is? I don't believe this!

01:01:40.501 --> 01:01:42.662
- Let's dance!
- Debbie, what's going on?

01:01:42.737 --> 01:01:45.297
It's okay. Everybody thinks
he's just a toy!

01:01:46.507 --> 01:01:47.940
Hi, Michael.

01:01:48.009 --> 01:01:50.204
The thing I was telling you about,
it's in the teddy suit.

01:01:50.278 --> 01:01:52.041
Oh, no way!
He's so cute!

01:01:52.113 --> 01:01:54.377
Yeah, real cute. Listen, those guys
who were following us, they're here.

01:01:54.449 --> 01:01:55.746
Well, what are we gonna do?

01:01:55.817 --> 01:01:58.718
I don't know. Just keep him dancing,
they'll just think he's a teddy.

01:02:04.893 --> 01:02:08.192
Okay, pick up the pace,
That's very good, Kathy,

01:03:09.257 --> 01:03:11.919
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

01:03:12.493 --> 01:03:14.927
This is Base-1.
Where are you guys? Move it!

01:03:25.974 --> 01:03:27.498
All right, come on, move it.
Let's go.

01:03:55.503 --> 01:03:57.232
Leave him alone!
He's not hurting anyone!

01:03:57.305 --> 01:03:59.671
You don't know
what you're getting into.

01:03:59.741 --> 01:04:01.834
- What's he done wrong?
- Come on, kid, back off.

01:04:01.909 --> 01:04:03.069
What's he done wrong?

01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:09.749
Hold on, Mac.

01:04:09.817 --> 01:04:12.479
Get after them! Move it!

01:04:12.553 --> 01:04:14.248
Let's get the car.

01:04:14.322 --> 01:04:16.847
Get him before he hits the street!
Look out!

01:04:16.924 --> 01:04:18.152
Come on.

01:04:19.761 --> 01:04:21.126
All right, come on!

01:04:21.195 --> 01:04:23.629
- Come on!
- Oh, no!

01:04:27.135 --> 01:04:28.534
I got him! I got him!

01:04:29.103 --> 01:04:30.161
Come on.

01:04:38.079 --> 01:04:40.013
Come on, come on, come on!

01:04:40.081 --> 01:04:41.639
Go! Keep going!

01:04:51.726 --> 01:04:52.715
Come on!

01:04:52.794 --> 01:04:54.523
- Look out!
- Stay with him!

01:04:57.832 --> 01:04:59.026
Come on!

01:05:04.439 --> 01:05:06.339
Come on! Come on!

01:05:26.828 --> 01:05:27.988
Stay with him!

01:06:04.098 --> 01:06:06.362
He's in here!
Come on, come on!

01:06:06.434 --> 01:06:07.765
Let's go, let's go!

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.034
Check the aisles!

01:06:17.945 --> 01:06:18.934
There he is!

01:06:23.451 --> 01:06:24.782
Let's get him!
Let's get him!

01:06:25.786 --> 01:06:28.118
- You okay?
- I'm okay. Go!

01:06:29.123 --> 01:06:30.556
Mom! Mom!

01:06:32.126 --> 01:06:33.457
Mom!

01:06:33.528 --> 01:06:35.052
How long have you
been in lingerie?

01:06:35.129 --> 01:06:36.118
Mom!

01:06:37.131 --> 01:06:39.224
Excuse me,
I'll be right back. Eric!

01:06:41.969 --> 01:06:43.732
Come on, guys, cool it!

01:06:43.804 --> 01:06:46.102
- What are you people doing?
- Stop that kid!

01:06:46.174 --> 01:06:48.074
Eric! What is that on your lap?

01:06:49.277 --> 01:06:50.642
Stop!

01:06:55.283 --> 01:06:58.013
The door's jammed!
The door's jammed!

01:06:58.085 --> 01:07:00.280
Get something!
Get something!

01:07:05.993 --> 01:07:07.585
What do you think you're doing?

01:07:08.162 --> 01:07:09.151
Eric!

01:07:09.997 --> 01:07:11.931
This is not gonna work, Michael!

01:07:11.999 --> 01:07:14.968
- Just trust me.
- It's gonna work.

01:07:15.036 --> 01:07:16.628
Be careful.

01:07:16.704 --> 01:07:17.693
Eric!

01:07:17.772 --> 01:07:19.399
Don't hit him, Courtney!

01:07:20.408 --> 01:07:22.467
- Get him!
- Get ready!

01:07:22.543 --> 01:07:23.703
Stay with him.

01:07:24.712 --> 01:07:26.680
Michael! Eric!

01:07:26.747 --> 01:07:28.146
Come on, we've got you!

01:07:30.518 --> 01:07:33.112
- Now!
- You got him!

01:07:33.187 --> 01:07:34.347
All right!

01:07:36.958 --> 01:07:39.017
Hey, those are
my kids in there!

01:07:39.093 --> 01:07:42.460
Those kids? Those kids
just ran off with a...

01:07:44.031 --> 01:07:46.465
A little creature from outer space?

01:07:48.736 --> 01:07:50.397
No, Wickes.

01:07:50.471 --> 01:07:53.372
Well, no, Palmdale's fine.
I just need...

01:07:53.441 --> 01:07:54.999
That's fine, thank you.

01:07:56.010 --> 01:07:58.877
No, the address.
Wait, give me that again.

01:07:58.946 --> 01:08:00.709
Why don't you give it to him?

01:08:00.781 --> 01:08:02.180
Here, Mac.

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:04.411
I don't think
he's feeling too good.

01:08:04.485 --> 01:08:08.649
Something's happened to his family.
He keeps on pointing in the same direction.

01:08:08.723 --> 01:08:11.692
There's a Wickes in Palmdale.
It's about 20 miles from the crash.

01:08:11.759 --> 01:08:14.227
- We have to go there.
- What do you think?

01:08:14.295 --> 01:08:15.922
I think we should call your mom.

01:08:15.997 --> 01:08:18.988
Look, she's not gonna understand.
She's just gonna tell us to turn him in.

01:08:19.066 --> 01:08:21.000
Maybe that's what we should do.

01:08:21.068 --> 01:08:22.591
No, we have to help him.

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:24.729
What if they have a good reason
for wanting him, Eric?

01:08:24.805 --> 01:08:27.399
What if he's dangerous?
What if he's got a disease or something?

01:08:27.475 --> 01:08:29.602
He doesn't have any diseases.

01:08:29.676 --> 01:08:32.077
I know no one's interested
what I have to say,

01:08:32.145 --> 01:08:34.307
but I think he's
communicating with someone.

01:08:34.381 --> 01:08:35.814
It's his family.

01:08:35.883 --> 01:08:38.180
Don't you like him?

01:08:38.252 --> 01:08:40.345
Of course I do.

01:08:40.421 --> 01:08:42.548
I just don't want anyone
to get hurt.

01:08:42.622 --> 01:08:45.683
We're gonna get caught sooner or later.
I don't see what we've got to lose.

01:08:51.265 --> 01:08:52.254
We're gonna go.

01:08:52.332 --> 01:08:55.666
Come on. Let's do it.

01:08:55.736 --> 01:08:56.895
All right!

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.029
Let's go, come on!

01:08:58.104 --> 01:08:59.332
All right!

01:09:31.505 --> 01:09:33.029
Thank you, my dear.

01:09:35.843 --> 01:09:37.935
Ooh, he likes this.

01:09:40.046 --> 01:09:42.106
Here, see if he likes this.

01:09:57.365 --> 01:09:59.230
Maybe they're just flowers.

01:10:00.501 --> 01:10:02.628
- How about a spaceship?
- Great!

01:10:02.703 --> 01:10:04.568
Yeah, and we'll have
a close encounter of the third kind.

01:10:04.638 --> 01:10:05.627
What's that?

01:10:05.706 --> 01:10:07.901
That's when you get to go
on the ship.

01:10:07.975 --> 01:10:09.670
Here's another police car.

01:10:09.744 --> 01:10:10.733
Keep him down.

01:10:12.113 --> 01:10:13.102
We're fine.

01:10:19.553 --> 01:10:21.646
Hey, he's pointing at something.

01:10:21.722 --> 01:10:23.485
It's the horses.

01:10:23.557 --> 01:10:26.151
We've been passing horses
all the way here.

01:10:26.227 --> 01:10:27.285
Hey, did you see that?

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:31.022
What?

01:10:34.034 --> 01:10:35.023
That's it!

01:10:35.102 --> 01:10:36.831
It's a sign, not a store.

01:10:36.904 --> 01:10:38.872
Looks like he wants
to go down there.

01:10:38.939 --> 01:10:40.930
Maybe he's picking up
some sort of signal.

01:10:41.008 --> 01:10:41.997
Hold on.

01:10:42.076 --> 01:10:44.237
Maybe he lives around here.

01:11:26.921 --> 01:11:27.910
Hey, look!

01:11:27.988 --> 01:11:31.082
Windmills! That's what
he was trying to tell us.

01:11:31.158 --> 01:11:33.183
It's the straws! That's it!

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:34.921
We must be getting closer!

01:11:34.995 --> 01:11:37.862
Bummer. I thought it was
gonna be a spaceship.

01:11:37.932 --> 01:11:40.332
You never know.
There still could be one.

01:12:35.155 --> 01:12:37.316
What's he doing?

01:12:37.391 --> 01:12:39.256
He's communicating.

01:13:07.054 --> 01:13:08.112
That's it.

01:13:20.601 --> 01:13:21.966
Let's go.

01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:55.567
You sure this is it, Mac?

01:13:59.506 --> 01:14:01.235
You guys better just wait here.

01:14:01.308 --> 01:14:02.832
Better give him the flashlight.

01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:04.241
Let's go, Mac.
Come on, on my back.

01:14:07.615 --> 01:14:08.639
Be careful.

01:14:11.619 --> 01:14:14.417
I know everybody's trying
to be optimistic,

01:14:14.488 --> 01:14:16.388
but what if
they really are dangerous?

01:14:16.457 --> 01:14:18.584
- They're not dangerous.
- Michael!

01:14:18.659 --> 01:14:20.889
Are you sure it's okay?

01:14:20.961 --> 01:14:22.326
Yeah, just wait there.

01:15:33.133 --> 01:15:34.896
Get off, Mac. Come on.

01:16:01.328 --> 01:16:03.262
She's alive, Mac.

01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:05.389
We're gonna get some help.
Just stay here.

01:16:05.466 --> 01:16:06.694
She's alive.

01:16:12.239 --> 01:16:14.036
Give me some drinks,
and the jackets.

01:16:14.108 --> 01:16:15.769
- What is it?
- There's three more of them.

01:16:15.843 --> 01:16:16.832
Three?

01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:18.741
- Are they friendly?
- We'll find out soon enough.

01:16:18.812 --> 01:16:21.610
- There's only two cans left.
- That's fine, let's go.

01:16:21.682 --> 01:16:23.081
Come on, Eric.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.554
Be careful.
It's slippery there, guys.

01:16:28.622 --> 01:16:29.816
Hey, Mac.

01:16:35.129 --> 01:16:36.153
Give me a straw.

01:16:45.072 --> 01:16:46.630
That's it.

01:16:46.707 --> 01:16:48.038
See, Mac?

01:16:48.108 --> 01:16:50.542
She's gonna be okay, Mac.

01:16:54.648 --> 01:16:55.637
It's okay.

01:16:55.716 --> 01:16:57.877
All right, see if you can
get the other one to drink,

01:16:57.951 --> 01:16:59.111
the little one.

01:16:59.186 --> 01:17:00.175
Here.

01:17:16.603 --> 01:17:17.592
Good.

01:17:21.341 --> 01:17:23.536
Here, put the jacket on her.

01:17:25.179 --> 01:17:26.168
Okay.

01:17:30.017 --> 01:17:32.383
It's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

01:17:32.452 --> 01:17:34.852
Here's your baby.
He brought us to you.

01:17:34.922 --> 01:17:36.617
Easy, now. It's okay.

01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:39.682
- She must be Mac's sister.
- Must be.

01:17:43.096 --> 01:17:44.620
She's so gentle.

01:17:47.868 --> 01:17:49.233
Easy. Easy.

01:17:53.874 --> 01:17:55.432
She won't hurt you.

01:17:55.509 --> 01:17:58.239
I'm Debbie.
I live next door.

01:18:00.714 --> 01:18:02.682
This is my friend Eric.

01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.979
Hi.

01:18:21.668 --> 01:18:23.499
Here, give me the other jacket.

01:18:24.504 --> 01:18:25.971
Okay, just a minute.

01:18:46.193 --> 01:18:48.093
All right, put the jacket on.

01:18:49.863 --> 01:18:51.353
Give me that one, too, Debbie.

01:18:51.431 --> 01:18:55.367
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on!
Guys, give me another drink!

01:18:55.435 --> 01:18:56.766
We don't have any more.

01:18:56.837 --> 01:18:59.670
- Oh, shoot!
- We better get something soon!

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:03.574
We're Mac's friends.
He brought us to meet you.

01:19:03.644 --> 01:19:05.111
No, friends,

01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:59.025
What if they need some kind of
medical attention or something?

01:19:59.099 --> 01:20:01.897
Look, we can't just walk into a hospital.
Everyone's gonna freak out.

01:20:01.969 --> 01:20:04.437
It's just like you said, people
are gonna find out sooner or later.

01:20:04.504 --> 01:20:06.768
Oh, my gosh...

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.171
What's he doing now?

01:20:08.241 --> 01:20:10.573
He just tied a knot
in the tire iron!

01:20:10.644 --> 01:20:12.077
It's okay, I think he's just bored!

01:20:12.145 --> 01:20:15.205
Well, keep him busy!
Guys, keep him busy!

01:20:15.282 --> 01:20:17.876
- Here! Here, read him this!
- It's okay. He's got the hat.

01:20:17.951 --> 01:20:19.009
Look, maybe we should go public.

01:20:19.086 --> 01:20:21.520
If we can get 'em on the news,
everyone is gonna want to help 'em.

01:20:21.588 --> 01:20:22.850
I'm not so sure about that.

01:20:22.923 --> 01:20:24.618
I think they'll be a big hit on TV.

01:20:24.691 --> 01:20:27.683
- What's he doing now?
- I think he wants my bracelet.

01:20:27.761 --> 01:20:29.456
- Well, then, give it to him!
- You're hurting me!

01:20:29.529 --> 01:20:30.928
- Michael!
- Well, do something!

01:20:30.998 --> 01:20:32.727
- What?
- I'm driving. I don't know.

01:20:32.799 --> 01:20:34.858
You can't do this
when we're in a vehicle like this.

01:20:34.935 --> 01:20:38.928
Now, you just cross your arms and don't
unloose them until I tell you you can.

01:20:39.006 --> 01:20:40.303
Cross your arms.

01:20:40.374 --> 01:20:43.275
That's right. Just be the mommy,
be the mommy.

01:20:43.343 --> 01:20:44.401
That's right. You teach 'em.

01:20:44.745 --> 01:20:45.939
How much further is it?

01:20:46.013 --> 01:20:47.207
We should be there by now.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.907
He's starting to move again.

01:20:48.982 --> 01:20:50.916
What do you want me to do?

01:20:50.984 --> 01:20:53.248
- Simon says!
- Simon says, yeah.

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.947
- Put your hands on your head.
- Hands on your head.

01:20:55.022 --> 01:20:56.922
- Your head.
- That's right, on your head.

01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:59.720
Head. Your head.

01:20:59.793 --> 01:21:01.624
All right, it's working, guys!

01:21:01.695 --> 01:21:03.856
- Okay, Simon says to...
- All right, great.

01:21:03.930 --> 01:21:06.296
Simon says... wiggle your ears.

01:21:06.366 --> 01:21:07.924
Wiggle your ears.
Wiggle your ears.

01:21:10.670 --> 01:21:12.763
All right, it's working!

01:21:12.839 --> 01:21:14.067
Think of another one.

01:21:14.141 --> 01:21:15.904
Clap your hands.
Simon says clap your hands.

01:21:15.976 --> 01:21:17.136
Clap your hands.

01:21:17.711 --> 01:21:22.239
Old MacDonald had a farm,
e- i-e-i-o

01:21:22.315 --> 01:21:26.911
And on this farm he had a bird,
e- i-e-i-o

01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:32.282
All right, just keep 'em singin',
all right?

01:21:33.493 --> 01:21:35.256
- All right, you got any money?
- Yeah.

01:21:35.328 --> 01:21:37.922
All right, pay for the gas, get some drinks.
I'm gonna call my mom.

01:21:37.998 --> 01:21:40.432
- What if they trace the call?
- We're not gonna be here that long.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.967
- Just go do it.
- Okay.

01:21:48.175 --> 01:21:50.939
- Do you need anything?
- Yeah, get me some smokes.

01:22:12.466 --> 01:22:13.899
Don't do that!

01:22:15.902 --> 01:22:18.996
It's okay, they won't hurt you!
They won't hurt you!

01:22:19.072 --> 01:22:21.563
Well, when did she leave?

01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:25.471
Did she say where she was going?

01:22:25.545 --> 01:22:27.137
You better come quick.

01:22:27.214 --> 01:22:29.910
They got out of the van.
Everbody's freaking!

01:22:30.984 --> 01:22:32.713
Why didn't you
keep them singing, Debbie?

01:22:32.786 --> 01:22:34.879
Ma'am, I have to total
all the groceries first,

01:22:34.955 --> 01:22:36.388
then I can deduct the coupons.

01:22:36.456 --> 01:22:38.686
What is that?

01:22:38.758 --> 01:22:39.747
Dad!

01:22:39.826 --> 01:22:42.659
It's all right, son. It's just
a promotional gag or something.

01:22:44.564 --> 01:22:47.692
Well, they're not
advertising clothes, that's for sure.

01:22:47.767 --> 01:22:50.702
Oh, I think they are real.

01:22:50.770 --> 01:22:52.761
Oh, they don't know
what they're doing.

01:22:52.839 --> 01:22:53.897
We're getting out of here.

01:22:53.974 --> 01:22:56.306
Ernie, customer service
to register four,

01:22:58.678 --> 01:22:59.736
Do you believe this?

01:22:59.813 --> 01:23:01.804
That's it, man.
I'm going back on the soda.

01:23:04.284 --> 01:23:06.252
Hey! Hey, put that down!

01:23:08.121 --> 01:23:10.555
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:23:12.459 --> 01:23:14.427
I don't believe this.

01:23:19.633 --> 01:23:22.693
- Stay with Mommy.
- Security. Get security, quick!

01:23:22.769 --> 01:23:26.364
Security to the front, please,
Buck, get up here,

01:23:27.374 --> 01:23:29.365
- What is that?
- I don't know. Get 'em out of here.

01:23:29.442 --> 01:23:30.909
Don't hurt 'em.
They're not dangerous.

01:23:30.977 --> 01:23:32.638
They won't hurt you.

01:23:32.712 --> 01:23:34.236
All right, now you
put that down right now.

01:23:34.314 --> 01:23:35.542
They're not dangerous.

01:23:35.615 --> 01:23:37.810
Like hell it isn't.
Now, now, put it down.

01:23:37.884 --> 01:23:39.545
Look, they're not gonna hurt you.

01:23:39.619 --> 01:23:41.985
Look, I'll pay for the damage.

01:23:42.055 --> 01:23:44.080
You stand back, now.
I'm warning you.

01:23:44.157 --> 01:23:45.556
No, they don't understand you.

01:23:45.625 --> 01:23:46.922
He's telling the truth.

01:23:46.993 --> 01:23:48.620
Tell him to back off!

01:23:48.695 --> 01:23:50.390
No!

01:23:53.166 --> 01:23:54.463
Give me the gun!

01:23:55.535 --> 01:23:56.661
Get out of here!

01:23:56.736 --> 01:23:58.636
- I'm not leaving!
- Go!

01:24:02.008 --> 01:24:03.270
Give me the gun.

01:24:03.343 --> 01:24:05.174
Step back!
Move away from it!

01:24:05.245 --> 01:24:08.180
- Step away from it!
- They're not gonna hurt you!

01:24:08.248 --> 01:24:10.580
- Move it, now!
- Michael, please!

01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:13.847
You don't understand!
They're not gonna hurt anyone!

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.717
Give me the gun!

01:24:15.789 --> 01:24:17.416
Come on!

01:24:17.490 --> 01:24:18.650
Don't shoot 'em!

01:24:18.725 --> 01:24:21.057
Come on, don't shoot 'em!
They're not gonna hurt you!

01:24:22.362 --> 01:24:24.353
I don't know where they came from.
We found them in a cave.

01:24:24.431 --> 01:24:26.160
Just get over to the car.
Come on, move!

01:24:26.233 --> 01:24:28.929
- They're not dangerous!
- Just get 'em down here right away!

01:24:29.002 --> 01:24:31.562
No! Leave 'em alone!
They're not gonna hurt anyone!

01:24:31.638 --> 01:24:33.128
Hold your fire, everybody!

01:24:33.206 --> 01:24:35.037
- Hold your fire!
- It's still got a gun.

01:24:35.108 --> 01:24:37.474
Just do as I tell you.
Hold your fire.

01:24:37.544 --> 01:24:38.602
This is the police,

01:24:38.678 --> 01:24:41.203
Put down your gun,
and nothing will happen to you,

01:24:41.281 --> 01:24:45.081
I repeat, put down your gun,
and nothing will happen to you,

01:24:45.151 --> 01:24:46.482
He doesn't understand you.

01:24:46.553 --> 01:24:49.021
Get back, get back, get back.

01:24:52.826 --> 01:24:54.760
Get those people out of here.
Get those people back.

01:24:54.828 --> 01:24:55.817
Move it!

01:24:55.895 --> 01:24:58.659
- Get those people out of here!
- Evacuate that building!

01:24:58.732 --> 01:25:00.063
Get those people
out of that building!

01:25:00.133 --> 01:25:01.600
Can you tell them to stop?

01:25:01.668 --> 01:25:03.329
I told you,
they don't understand.

01:25:03.403 --> 01:25:05.337
Clear this building now!

01:25:05.405 --> 01:25:09.102
I can stop them!
Let me go out there, please!

01:25:09.175 --> 01:25:11.507
I can't let you do that, son.
He's got a gun.

01:25:13.413 --> 01:25:14.402
We're gonna lose 'em, Bill!

01:25:14.481 --> 01:25:16.676
They don't know how to drive, anyway!

01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:17.739
Stop him!

01:25:17.817 --> 01:25:19.341
Eric!

01:25:23.757 --> 01:25:25.054
No!

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:42.169
Get a doctor!

01:25:54.287 --> 01:25:56.278
Let me get him on the ground.

01:25:56.356 --> 01:25:59.257
Come on, Eric.
Eric, talk to me, please!

01:25:59.326 --> 01:26:01.794
Eric! Eric, talk to me!

01:26:01.861 --> 01:26:03.886
Talk to me, Eric.
Come on.

01:26:03.963 --> 01:26:05.225
I know he's still breathing.

01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:08.829
- Eric!
- He's gonna be okay.

01:26:09.903 --> 01:26:11.564
Get back, I'm a doctor.
Get back.

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.267
Oh, my God!

01:26:15.342 --> 01:26:19.369
Eric! Come on, Eric,
talk to me, please!

01:26:19.446 --> 01:26:20.913
What is it?

01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:22.971
Eric, everything's gonna be okay.

01:26:23.983 --> 01:26:24.972
He's gone.

01:26:25.051 --> 01:26:26.382
What?

01:26:26.453 --> 01:26:29.217
- He's gone?
- There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.

01:26:29.289 --> 01:26:30.278
Eric!

01:26:30.357 --> 01:26:32.518
Oh, my God!

01:26:34.294 --> 01:26:35.955
He can't be!

01:26:36.029 --> 01:26:37.963
My God, Eric!

01:26:59.352 --> 01:27:02.253
- We've got a problem.
- What is it?

01:27:02.322 --> 01:27:04.984
- Little boy's been hurt.
- Which little boy?

01:27:05.058 --> 01:27:07.049
I don't know his name,
but he's in a wheelchair!

01:27:07.127 --> 01:27:08.754
- Where is he?
- He's over here.

01:27:08.828 --> 01:27:10.762
- Wickett, secure the area.
- Take that area over there.

01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:13.162
He's ten years old!

01:27:13.233 --> 01:27:15.599
All you people move back!

01:27:17.670 --> 01:27:19.035
Let me in. I'm his mother.

01:27:21.508 --> 01:27:24.033
They can't help him!
They can't!

01:27:30.683 --> 01:27:32.674
We tried to stop him.

01:27:35.355 --> 01:27:37.118
Oh, my baby.

01:27:45.532 --> 01:27:47.022
My baby!

01:28:35.982 --> 01:28:40.078
They won't hurt you, Mom.
They won't hurt you.

01:28:46.159 --> 01:28:47.956
They're not gonna hurt him, Mom.

01:28:49.028 --> 01:28:50.723
Just trust 'em, all right?

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.589
Eric.

01:31:16.142 --> 01:31:17.632
You okay?

01:31:18.645 --> 01:31:20.237
He's okay!

01:31:32.325 --> 01:31:34.350
Mom? Mom?

01:31:49.509 --> 01:31:51.773
Okay, the house.
Is everything arranged in the house?

01:31:51.844 --> 01:31:53.106
Everything's been taken care of.

01:31:53.179 --> 01:31:55.010
- What about the car?
- It's fine!

01:31:55.081 --> 01:31:57.447
- Headroom-what about headroom?
- It's perfect. There's plenty of headroom!

01:31:57.517 --> 01:31:59.178
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive!

01:31:59.252 --> 01:32:01.447
- Let's go! We can't be late!
- I'm coming!

01:32:08.461 --> 01:32:12.056
All rise,
Please raise your right hand,

01:32:14.867 --> 01:32:16.459
I hereby declare on oath

01:32:16.536 --> 01:32:19.266

potentate, state, or sovereignty,

been a subject or citizen,

01:32:33.653 --> 01:32:36.121
that I will support and defend

01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:40.319

01:32:49.168 --> 01:32:53.605

of the United States of America

01:32:53.673 --> 01:32:56.767
when required by the law,

01:32:56.843 --> 01:33:00.836
that I will perform noncombative service
in the armed forces

01:33:00.913 --> 01:33:02.938
when required by the law,

01:33:03.015 --> 01:33:06.451
that I will perform work
of national import

01:33:06.519 --> 01:33:10.888
under civilian direction
when required by the law,

01:33:10.957 --> 01:33:14.051
and that I have
taken this obligation freely,

01:33:14.127 --> 01:33:19.030
without any mentaI reservation
or purpose of evasion,

01:33:19.098 --> 01:33:21.191
so help me God,

01:33:21.267 --> 01:33:23.735
And if you agree
to all of the above,

01:33:23.803 --> 01:33:27.000
please state so by saying, "I do,"

01:33:27.073 --> 01:33:28.734
I do.

01:33:28.808 --> 01:33:31.242
Now, may I extend
a warm congratulation,

01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:35.838
You are now citizens
of the United States of America.
