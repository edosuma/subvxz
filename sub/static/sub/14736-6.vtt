Renaldo, after
weeks of work...

00:13.844 --> 00:16.267
I'm finally ready
to show you the maze

00:16.267 --> 00:19.060
Shelby has asked me
to construct for the
school's Halloween carnival.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.643
That's really great, Barry.
I have one question...

00:22.643 --> 00:24.525
Oh, this is just a model.
The real one is bigger.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.606
Then I have
no questions.

00:26.607 --> 00:27.698
Hey, guys.

00:27.698 --> 00:28.949

00:29.700 --> 00:31.322
Was that the maze?

00:31.322 --> 00:32.453
It's gonna be bigger, right?

00:32.453 --> 00:34.415
That's what I said!

00:34.415 --> 00:36.497
Oh, Barry, this maze
has to be great.

00:36.497 --> 00:39.250
This is the first time
I'm in charge of
the whole carnival,

00:39.250 --> 00:42.293
and everybody will be
disappointed if it's not
the scariest one yet.

00:42.293 --> 00:43.464
Don't worry, Shelby.

00:43.464 --> 00:44.665
Nobody knows
who plans these things.

00:44.665 --> 00:46.257
They'll know
who planned this one.

00:47.718 --> 00:48.929
Relax.

00:48.929 --> 00:51.552
I have designed
a maze so scary,

00:51.552 --> 00:54.435
those who experience
it will never be able
to forget it.

00:54.435 --> 00:56.517
Like when you see a teacher
at the grocery store.

00:56.517 --> 00:59.019
And they're
wearing shorts.

00:59.019 --> 01:00.561
Hey, Barry,
is this for the maze?

01:00.561 --> 01:03.524
No! Careful, that is
concentrated wolf hormone!

01:03.524 --> 01:06.527
I've been using it
on mice to see if I can
get them to chase cats.

01:06.527 --> 01:10.901
If successful, I will
build a mouse army to
do the impossible,

01:10.901 --> 01:13.364
finally get my cat
to respect me.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.457
You named her
Purrmione Granger.

01:16.457 --> 01:19.039
She'll never
respect you.

01:19.039 --> 01:23.624
At this point, I'd be happy
if she'd just stop flushing
the toilet while I shower.

I'll help you take
this stuff down
to the school.

It's right now.

03:25.666 --> 03:28.289
Sorry. There was a spider
on this piece of aluminum.

away by making the sound
of thunder.

"The Mistakes of Science"?

03:34.465 --> 03:35.636
What's scary about that?

03:35.636 --> 03:37.678
Uh, only everything.

03:37.678 --> 03:40.891
For instance, the entire maze
is lit using direct current,

03:40.891 --> 03:43.554
an invention so
terrifyingly unstable

03:43.554 --> 03:46.647
it brought the 1880
World's Fair to its knees.

Oh, I can't breathe.
My heart is racing.

03:50.941 --> 03:54.275
That's what people
will say when they read the
maze's informational placards

03:54.275 --> 03:56.947
about antibiotic-resistant
bacteria,

03:56.947 --> 04:02.122
the hubris of fracking and
the perilous overpopulation
of the cane toad.

04:03.624 --> 04:05.626
This is going
to be a disaster.

04:05.626 --> 04:07.368
Yes, as big a disaster

04:07.368 --> 04:09.920
as the poorly planned city
the maze was designed after,

04:09.920 --> 04:12.002
full of one-way streets
and dead ends.

11:08.588 --> 11:10.841
I can't just let him
run around
terrorizing everyone.

11:10.841 --> 11:12.462
Uh, maybe I can go
calm him down.

11:13.794 --> 11:15.095
(SNARLING)

11:17.057 --> 11:19.639
Diesel, it's okay.

11:19.639 --> 11:21.101
(BARKS)
 It's okay.

11:22.062 --> 11:24.144
Who's a good boy?

11:24.144 --> 11:25.515
Who's my good...

11:25.515 --> 11:26.606
(RETCHES)

11:36.696 --> 11:37.948
Are you okay?

11:37.948 --> 11:39.740
Well, my dog is a werewolf,

11:39.740 --> 11:41.031
he just barfed all over me,

11:41.031 --> 11:42.913
and a little bit
got in my mouth.

11:42.913 --> 11:45.705
Does that answer
your question?

11:45.705 --> 11:48.458
Let's just jump back
to before he ate that
goo in the first place.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.710
That way he'll never
turn into Were-Diesel.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.883
You couldn't have thought
of that before I got gooed?

11:56.136 --> 11:57.097
(WHINING)

11:59.099 --> 12:02.432
Diesel, you're wild-eyed,
snaggle-toothed,

12:02.432 --> 12:04.684
and you stink like cabbage.

12:04.684 --> 12:06.346
It's good to have
you back, buddy.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.403
Shelbs, I stopped him!
Crisis averted.

12:13.403 --> 12:14.985
Oh, thank goodness.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.027
Listen, when you do
your scare for real,

12:17.027 --> 12:19.159
I want the kids to
feel like their lives
are in danger,

12:19.159 --> 12:21.281
but not actually
be in danger.

12:21.281 --> 12:22.953
I should have given you
that guideline, though.

12:22.953 --> 12:24.995
That's on me.

12:24.995 --> 12:27.327
Shelbs, I need to talk
to you about that scare...

12:27.327 --> 12:29.830
If you turned Diesel into
a werewolf on accident,

12:29.830 --> 12:32.042
I can't wait to see
what you do on purpose!

12:33.083 --> 12:35.255
Yeah, you and me both.

12:36.636 --> 12:37.798
What was that?

12:37.798 --> 12:39.509
Oh, thought you hung up,
gotta go!

12:51.191 --> 12:54.154
Wow, the high school
Halloween carnival.

12:54.154 --> 12:56.897
Ooh! Looks like everyone's
too scared to show up.

12:56.897 --> 12:58.568
Or we're 20 minutes early.

12:58.568 --> 13:00.160
I like the way I said it.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.114
I don't think
we should be in here.

13:04.114 --> 13:06.616
Man up, Bret.
We're teenagers now.

13:06.616 --> 13:08.578
No one can tell us
what to do.

13:08.578 --> 13:10.330
You're right.
Follow me.

13:10.330 --> 13:11.791
Right behind you, boss.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.878
There we go, Renaldo.
All finished.

13:17.878 --> 13:22.302
Barry, you think maybe
we should put a few things in
that normal people find scary?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.424
What do normal people
find scary?

13:24.424 --> 13:27.137
You know, werewolves,
vampires, ghosts, goblins,

13:27.137 --> 13:28.768
ghouls, specters,
banshees, zombies,

13:28.768 --> 13:30.270
witches, warlocks,
chupacabras, bigfoots,

13:30.270 --> 13:32.522
yetis and wampus cats.

13:32.522 --> 13:34.524
As well as necromancers,
swamp people, hill people,

13:34.524 --> 13:36.146
mole people, moth men,
jabberwockies,

13:36.146 --> 13:38.568
and leprechauns
with a score to settle.

13:38.568 --> 13:42.112
Renaldo, none of
those things are scary
because they don't exist.

13:42.112 --> 13:45.205
My maze is filled
with actual terrors
from real life.

13:45.205 --> 13:46.116
For instance...

13:48.578 --> 13:49.659
This grate.

13:51.411 --> 13:53.043
Back in the 1970s,

13:53.043 --> 13:56.046
vents like these were
breeding grounds for
black mold,

13:56.046 --> 13:58.048
which could cause
respiratory problems.

13:58.048 --> 14:02.592
And the ensuing insurance
paperwork would haunt
the victims for decades!

14:06.927 --> 14:10.310
Uh, Barry, I just saw
two zombie dolls!

14:10.310 --> 14:11.471
That is ridiculous.

14:11.471 --> 14:13.433
I know!
They're super territorial.

14:13.433 --> 14:14.854
They never travel in pairs.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.278
Renaldo, zombie dolls
aren't real.

14:18.278 --> 14:21.111
And neither are werewolves,
vampires, ghosts, ghouls,

14:21.111 --> 14:22.442
goblins, specters, zombies,

14:22.442 --> 14:24.284
witches, warlocks,
chupacabras,

14:24.284 --> 14:26.156
bigfoots, yetis,
wampus cats,

14:26.156 --> 14:28.158
necromancers,
swamp people,
hill people,

14:28.158 --> 14:29.910
mole people, moth men,
jabberwockies,

14:29.910 --> 14:31.661
or leprechauns
with a score to settle.

14:31.661 --> 14:33.333
Barry...
 What?

14:33.333 --> 14:35.335
You forgot banshees.

14:35.335 --> 14:38.088
(GRUNTS)
Let's just go tell Shelby
we're done with the maze.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.269
Ooh! Is that
your big scare?

14:49.269 --> 14:51.311
I'm so excited!
Lemme see it.

14:51.311 --> 14:53.603
Okay, but it's not
really finished.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.357
(GASPS)

14:57.357 --> 14:58.939
Ooh, are you scared?

14:58.939 --> 15:00.400
I'm horrified!

15:00.400 --> 15:02.442
That was my
grandmother's pillow!

15:02.442 --> 15:04.324
It was the last thing
she gave to me

15:04.324 --> 15:05.986
before she was taken
from us.

15:06.736 --> 15:08.198
By that silver fox Harold.

15:08.198 --> 15:10.410
They're in Sicily right now.
I just got a postcard.

15:11.741 --> 15:14.294
Okay, look, I couldn't
come up with anything!

15:14.294 --> 15:16.836
I know I'm supposed
to be the one with
the twisted mind,

15:16.836 --> 15:18.959
but everything
I've thought of is lame!

15:18.959 --> 15:22.542
I've lost my edge,
like, when comedians
become parents.

15:25.755 --> 15:27.007
Uh, Cyd?

15:27.007 --> 15:28.598
You might as well
tell the whole school,

15:28.598 --> 15:30.220
(IN DISTORTED VOICE)
Cyd Ripley is not scary.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.431
There, I said it.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.683
I'm not the monster
everybody thinks I am!

15:33.683 --> 15:34.934
(BONES CRACKING)

15:37.317 --> 15:38.938
Uh, Cyd?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.690
I don't want to freak
you out or anything,

15:40.690 --> 15:44.524
but you know how you
sometimes get that one hair
in between your eyebrows?

15:44.524 --> 15:47.197
Well, you have that right now,
but like all over your face.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.661
(IN DISTORTED VOICE)
What's happening?

15:51.661 --> 15:54.244
I don't know. It's like
you're turning into...

15:57.837 --> 15:59.379
(GROWLS)

15:59.379 --> 16:01.461
(SHRIEKS) Were-Cyd!

16:02.422 --> 16:04.504
(HOWLING)

16:09.719 --> 16:11.351
(GROWLS)

16:11.351 --> 16:14.054
It's okay, we can
still be best friends.

16:14.054 --> 16:16.766
I'll bring you steaks,
and we can go to the park,

16:16.766 --> 16:19.059
and I'll scratch your belly
until you fall asleep.

16:19.059 --> 16:22.192
I mean,
when you think about it,
not that much has changed.

16:22.192 --> 16:24.524
(SNARLS)
 Except the part where
you're trying to eat me.

16:24.524 --> 16:25.865
(GROWLS)

16:29.489 --> 16:30.870
Um, Barry,

16:30.870 --> 16:33.493
I think we've passed
that cane toad
three times already.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.036
Or they could be
reproducing at a rapid rate.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.378
They have no natural
predators in this maze.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.420
All right, we're lost.

16:41.331 --> 16:43.002
Why'd you make it
so confusing?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.544
This maze is
like a labyrinth.

16:45.295 --> 16:46.626
Ah-ha!

16:46.626 --> 16:49.049
That's the
poorly planned
urban sprawl!

16:49.049 --> 16:52.052
It's so convoluted even
I don't know the way out.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.393
(VOCALIZING) Ooh!

16:53.393 --> 16:54.974
I really shouldn't
make light of it.

16:54.974 --> 16:56.436
We're trapped in here.

16:57.897 --> 16:59.349
(DISTANT HOWLING)

16:59.349 --> 17:00.440
What was that?

17:04.144 --> 17:06.236
Did you hear
that, Chet?
 Hear what?

17:06.236 --> 17:09.069
That scary howl.
 Oh, that.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.200
No.

17:11.320 --> 17:13.323
(DISTANT HOWLING)

17:13.323 --> 17:16.496
It's probably
somebody howling
'cause they're so bored.

17:16.496 --> 17:19.118
I thought High
School Halloween
would be scarier.

17:19.118 --> 17:22.291
It's like,
I'm not scared,
I'm just depressed.

17:23.463 --> 17:25.505
This maze keeps
telling us about things

17:25.505 --> 17:27.467
that even grownups
couldn't fix.

17:27.467 --> 17:30.220
We're gonna inherit
a broken world, Chet.

17:31.171 --> 17:32.842
I know how you feel.

17:32.842 --> 17:35.095
Thirty minutes ago,
my biggest worry was

17:35.095 --> 17:38.388
which one of us was going
to get stuck wearing
this stupid dress.

17:39.389 --> 17:41.351
You look beautiful, Chet.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.982
I should have
told you earlier.

17:47.687 --> 17:49.149
(PANTING) Okay.

17:49.149 --> 17:51.070
Everything is
going to be okay.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.402
How do you
stop a werewolf?

17:52.402 --> 17:54.694
Garlic! Argh!
No, that's vampires.

17:54.694 --> 17:57.407
Holy water! Argh!
No, that's also vampires.

17:57.407 --> 18:00.039
Hemlock! Argh!
No, that's Socrates!

18:00.039 --> 18:02.412
Dang it, this stupid maze
is making me learn things!

18:03.583 --> 18:05.255
(HOWLING CONTINUES)

18:05.255 --> 18:07.297
Cyd wouldn't really
eat me, would she?

18:08.418 --> 18:09.339
(SHRIEKS)

18:11.131 --> 18:13.553
Go ahead,
I hope I'm delicious!

18:15.555 --> 18:17.307
Shelby,
are you okay?

18:17.307 --> 18:18.928
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you guys.

18:18.928 --> 18:21.931
Of course you are.
Cause you're terrified
of my maze!

18:23.223 --> 18:25.024
No, Barry,
you don't understand...

18:25.024 --> 18:26.936
No, you two are the ones
who didn't understand.

18:26.936 --> 18:29.359
You both thought
my maze wouldn't
be scary.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.861
And yet here you are,
completely freaking out.

18:33.193 --> 18:34.404
Barry, behind you!
 (SNARLING)

18:34.404 --> 18:36.496
Oh, you'd love to
put this behind me.

18:36.496 --> 18:40.039
Just face it,
facts are scarier than
anything you can think of.

18:40.039 --> 18:41.161
Werewolf!

18:41.161 --> 18:43.623
Yes, werewolves,
vampires, banshees...

18:43.623 --> 18:44.544
No, Barry!

18:44.544 --> 18:45.915
(GROWLS)

(HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING)

18:51.461 --> 18:53.963

That was a cul-de-sac!
This way!

18:58.598 --> 19:00.220
(HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING)

19:01.181 --> 19:02.562
Shelby, what is going on?

19:02.562 --> 19:04.394
Why are we being
chased by a werewolf?

19:06.105 --> 19:07.857
Diesel ate some
of your wolf hormone,

19:07.857 --> 19:09.479
and then barfed it
on Cyd,

19:09.479 --> 19:11.361
and she turned
into a werewolf.

19:11.361 --> 19:12.402
(GROWLING)

19:14.614 --> 19:16.075
(SNARLING)

I can't believe
my sweet Cyd is actually
trying to hurt us.

19:19.489 --> 19:21.831
The Cyd we once
knew is gone forever,

19:21.831 --> 19:24.544
along with the 40 bucks
she owed me.

19:24.544 --> 19:25.625
Which is not important
right now.

19:25.625 --> 19:26.836
I'm just sorry
to lose it.

19:27.417 --> 19:28.378
Her.

19:29.379 --> 19:30.420
(SNARLING)

19:33.213 --> 19:34.594
What are you doing?

19:34.594 --> 19:36.466
I can't just leave
her like this.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.798
(SNARLS)

19:40.350 --> 19:41.721
Shelby,
be careful!

19:41.721 --> 19:43.683
It's okay.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.475
I know that
she would never hurt me.

19:50.310 --> 19:53.573
Cyd, you're
my best friend.

19:53.573 --> 19:55.485
I mean, you tried
so hard to help me

19:55.485 --> 19:59.659
that you accidentally turned
yourself into a werewolf.

19:59.659 --> 20:01.621
I know you're in
there somewhere.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.783
Come back to me.

20:03.783 --> 20:05.164

20:06.666 --> 20:08.087
I don't think
it's working.

20:08.087 --> 20:09.589

Maybe it's not Cyd.

I tried to eat you.

to eat anybody else,
I would have been jealous.

this isn't permanent.

Well, if you're anything
like the mice in my lab,

20:45.865 --> 20:47.707
you should go back
to normal in a few hours.

20:47.707 --> 20:49.128
(STUTTERS)
A few hours?

20:49.128 --> 20:51.331
What am I going
to do until then?

I have an idea.

my carnival.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.204
Thanks for trusting me
to go off-leash.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.539
I better get back in
there before people
start learning stuff.

21:32.211 --> 21:34.794
At least one good thing
came out of Cyd turning
into a werewolf.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.376
She saved
your lousy maze.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.718
It is not lousy!

21:38.718 --> 21:40.259
I'm sure
there was someone,

21:40.259 --> 21:43.383
who was deeply troubled
by the mistakes of science.

21:43.383 --> 21:45.304
I am deeply troubled.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.518
I mourn the loss
of my youth.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.140
Yes!

21:51.140 --> 21:54.023
I ruined that
young couple's life!

21:59.989 --> 22:03.032
I think having a big kid
Halloween was a mistake, Chet.

22:03.032 --> 22:05.365
I feel like
I've aged 50 years.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.658
More decaf?

22:08.658 --> 22:10.410
(GASPS) At this hour?

22:10.410 --> 22:11.751
Just half a cup.

22:14.714 --> 22:16.876
Ugh, I'm trying
to do my sudoku.

22:16.876 --> 22:18.127
Where are
my cheaters?

22:18.127 --> 22:19.629
They're on your head.

22:19.629 --> 22:21.010
Every day with you!

22:21.671 --> 22:23.222
(THUMPING)

22:23.222 --> 22:24.424
(SNARLING)

22:24.924 --> 22:26.846
Did you hear that?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.598
Those creepy footsteps
on the stairs?

22:29.138 --> 22:30.229
No.

22:31.811 --> 22:33.022
(SNARLS)

22:36.476 --> 22:37.647
Hey.

22:38.277 --> 22:39.739
(SCREAMING)

22:39.739 --> 22:41.401
That was terrifying!

22:41.401 --> 22:43.112
I feel like a kid again!

22:44.305 --> 22:50.710
