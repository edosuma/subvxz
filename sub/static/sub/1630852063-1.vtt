00:01.171 --> 00:03.771
(static music)

00:06.291 --> 00:08.891
(upbeat music)

00:25.291 --> 00:28.011
(crowd Cheering)

00:33.651 --> 00:37.831
- [PM] (laughs) Yes, yes, yes.

00:37.931 --> 00:40.031
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.

00:40.131 --> 00:41.431
We are back!

00:41.531 --> 00:44.511
(crowd cheering)

00:44.611 --> 00:49.590
- [PM] Love it, and we are still
here at BBC Television Centre,

00:49.690 --> 00:51.430
and I've gotta say boys,
it's good to be here.

00:51.530 --> 00:53.350
The history of this place,

00:53.450 --> 00:54.950
the shows that have been made here,

00:55.050 --> 00:56.710
and there's a lovely Greggs

00:56.810 --> 00:58.510
on the corner down there, fantastic!

00:58.610 --> 00:59.830
- Oh, love a steak bake, Paddy .

00:59.930 --> 01:00.630
- Love one, love one.

01:00.730 --> 01:02.670
- And we've got a
cracking series coming up,

01:02.770 --> 01:06.750
so much good stuff, super cars,
paint bombs, spicy chillies.

01:06.850 --> 01:09.350
- And his face when he saw
that sheep brains pate,

01:09.450 --> 01:10.570
and when you ran him
over with the big ball.

01:10.650 --> 01:12.350
- Yeah, no, listen this
is all well and good,

01:12.450 --> 01:14.390
but no one's got a clue
what we're talking about.

01:14.490 --> 01:15.910
Do you wanna see a sizzle?

01:16.010 --> 01:17.790
(crowd cheering)

01:17.890 --> 01:19.750
- Roll the VT.

01:19.850 --> 01:22.450
(static music)

01:26.290 --> 01:29.390
(engine revving)

01:29.490 --> 01:30.790
- Huh, right, I'm-

01:30.890 --> 01:32.229
(beep)

01:32.329 --> 01:34.669
(laughing)

01:34.769 --> 01:36.749
(engine revving)

01:36.849 --> 01:38.849
- [PM] Woo hoo hoo.

01:39.729 --> 01:40.669
- Are you gonna go for a habanero?

01:40.769 --> 01:43.269
- [PM] Get it in you, Flintoff.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.269
- I'm in trouble.

01:45.369 --> 01:46.109
- Come on.

01:46.209 --> 01:48.209
Ahhh, ahhh.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.429
- I think I've pulled summat.

01:50.529 --> 01:52.029
(engine revving)

01:52.129 --> 01:53.669
- Go on, Jeff.

01:53.769 --> 01:54.789
- Oh, that's a good shot, Jeff.

01:54.889 --> 01:55.829
- Go on, Jeff, hit it.

01:55.929 --> 01:57.069
(engine revving)

01:57.169 --> 01:58.669
- Oh, now we're moving.

01:58.769 --> 01:59.949
(engine revving)

02:00.049 --> 02:00.869
(laughs)

02:00.969 --> 02:01.709
- Shot it.

02:01.809 --> 02:02.669
(all laughing)

02:02.769 --> 02:04.789
- I've seen the end (laughs).

02:04.889 --> 02:07.429
(laughs)

02:07.529 --> 02:08.629
- Ohhh!

02:08.729 --> 02:09.509
- That's Fairy liquid!

02:09.609 --> 02:12.549
(laughing)

02:12.649 --> 02:15.789
(engine revving)

02:15.889 --> 02:18.328
- Now this is my kind of day.

02:19.448 --> 02:22.108
(engine revving)

02:22.208 --> 02:26.728
- (laughs) You're milking it now Pad.

02:27.768 --> 02:29.028
You're milking it!

02:29.128 --> 02:31.728
(all laughing)

02:35.368 --> 02:37.988
(crowd applauding)

02:38.088 --> 02:40.088
- Woo, hoo hoo!

02:41.528 --> 02:43.588
- Exciting, that's all to come.

02:43.688 --> 02:46.228
But what are we kicking things
off with tonight with, Fred?

02:46.328 --> 02:47.348
- It's a good one, Pad.

02:47.448 --> 02:51.908
Track specials, sports cars
made even faster, even sharper,

02:52.008 --> 02:54.748
to make you feel like a
hero around a race circuit.

02:54.848 --> 02:56.468
- And since pretty much well, forever,

02:56.568 --> 03:00.588
the best of the bunch has been
this, the Porsche 911 GT3.

03:00.688 --> 03:01.788
Here's the new one.

03:01.888 --> 03:05.107
And surprise, surprise, it is brilliant.

03:05.207 --> 03:07.587
- It really is, it's a beauty.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.147
But there's some serious
opposition out there,

03:10.247 --> 03:13.507
who are gonna give this little
rascal, a run for its money.

03:13.607 --> 03:16.167
So, the three of us went
to try some of them out.

03:17.207 --> 03:19.767
(static music)

03:23.087 --> 03:25.087
- [ Freddie] First onto the grid,

03:25.567 --> 03:29.447
is the Aston Martin Vantage, F1 edition.

03:32.807 --> 03:36.267
It's based on the latest
Formula 1 safety car,

03:36.367 --> 03:39.107
which for a road-going track special,

03:39.207 --> 03:41.207
is a pretty good place to start.

03:43.687 --> 03:46.587
But beneath the fancy
paint job and big wing,

03:46.687 --> 03:47.787
what this is really,

03:47.887 --> 03:51.886
is the car the Vantage
should always have been.

03:53.326 --> 03:55.906
(engine revving)

03:56.006 --> 03:58.626
- Now the V8 Vantage
has been around a while.

03:58.726 --> 04:00.626
I drove one on the show
a couple of years ago,

04:00.726 --> 04:02.426
and it was good,

04:02.526 --> 04:04.306
but it wasn't this good.

04:04.406 --> 04:06.746
(engine revving)

04:06.846 --> 04:09.506
Everything possible to
turn a decent sports car

04:09.606 --> 04:11.306
into a track monster.

04:11.406 --> 04:15.506
More downforce, more
power, more everything.

04:15.606 --> 04:18.066
(engine revving)

04:18.166 --> 04:20.466
The twin turbo V8 has been upgraded

04:20.566 --> 04:24.586
to produce 527 horsepower,

04:24.686 --> 04:28.246
so it'll now get to 60 in
just three and a half seconds.

04:29.126 --> 04:31.906
And to make sure you can
use that extra shove,

04:32.006 --> 04:34.166
they've gone to town on the chassis too.

04:35.126 --> 04:39.305
It's got stiffer bump
stops, more negative camber,

04:39.405 --> 04:41.405
and increased compression damping.

04:42.805 --> 04:45.305
Now I don't know what all that means,

04:45.405 --> 04:48.665
but what I will tell you,
it helps me do this.

04:48.765 --> 04:50.985
(engine revving)

04:51.085 --> 04:54.225
(car screeching)

04:54.325 --> 04:56.565
Oh yeah, this is a day out.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.745
(car screeching)

04:59.845 --> 05:01.625
Yeah, ha haaa! (laughs)

05:01.725 --> 05:03.345
Never mind the old Vantage.

05:03.445 --> 05:04.865
Thing of the past,

05:04.965 --> 05:06.065
you want the F1 edition.

05:06.165 --> 05:08.925
(car screeching)

05:10.885 --> 05:12.625
All right, the satnav's still rubbish,

05:12.725 --> 05:15.705
but a good thing about this car
is you're having so much fun

05:15.805 --> 05:17.225
you don't even notice.

05:17.325 --> 05:18.985
(engine revving)

05:19.085 --> 05:22.144
And you're basically driving the only car

05:22.244 --> 05:24.244
Lewis Hamilton can't overtake.

05:25.444 --> 05:27.444
Who knew safety could so much fun?

05:29.564 --> 05:31.824
(car screeching)

05:31.924 --> 05:36.924
- [Paddy] Very nice, but for my
money, not quite nice as this.

05:40.404 --> 05:43.604
The Alpha Romeo Giulia GTAm,

05:45.204 --> 05:47.824
based on the already brilliant top

05:47.924 --> 05:49.924
of the range Giulia Quadrifogolio,

05:51.044 --> 05:54.424
thanks to a whole load of
performance-enhancing upgrades,

05:54.524 --> 05:58.184
this is now a completely different animal.

05:58.284 --> 06:00.304
(engine revving)

06:00.404 --> 06:02.144
- Ha ha ha!

06:02.244 --> 06:04.584
0-60 this thing in less than four seconds

06:04.684 --> 06:06.424
and it's a four-door saloon.

06:06.524 --> 06:09.283
(engine revving)

06:11.923 --> 06:14.823
There we go-hoho!

06:14.923 --> 06:17.183
Alfa's F1 team even had a hand

06:17.283 --> 06:21.303
in making sure it goes
round a track like it should

06:21.403 --> 06:22.983
and it definitely does.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.303
(engine revving)

06:25.403 --> 06:26.543
- And that's because they didn't stop

06:26.643 --> 06:28.943
at the upgraded twin turbo V6

06:29.043 --> 06:33.023
that now makes over 530 horsepower.

06:33.123 --> 06:35.143
They also went to town

06:35.243 --> 06:37.783
stripping out every bit
of weight they could find.

06:37.883 --> 06:39.143
(engine revving)

06:39.243 --> 06:42.463
It's got a titanium exhaust,
polycarbonate windows,

06:42.563 --> 06:45.823
and inside there's
aluminium and carbon fibre

06:45.923 --> 06:47.983
as far as the eye can see.

06:48.083 --> 06:50.623
They've even taken the
rear seats out of the back.

06:50.723 --> 06:53.502
It's proper geeky Chris Harris stuff.

06:53.602 --> 06:56.142
(engine revving)

06:56.242 --> 07:01.342
The point is, this four-door
saloon is now quite simply

07:01.442 --> 07:05.822
the most extreme Alfa road car in decades.

07:05.922 --> 07:10.942
Whoa, there we go, we've got it back!

07:11.042 --> 07:11.782
Get on that.

07:11.882 --> 07:14.422
(engine revving)

07:14.522 --> 07:17.862
It really does feel special, this.

07:17.962 --> 07:20.042
The steering, the brakes.

07:21.042 --> 07:23.142
You just think it, it does it!

07:23.242 --> 07:26.802
And all that aside, just look at it.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.222
It's the Giulia but beefed up.

07:30.322 --> 07:32.262
(engine revving)

07:32.362 --> 07:34.702
It takes your breath away this car!

07:34.802 --> 07:38.182
(engine revving)

07:38.282 --> 07:41.361
- Oh, Paddy (claps).

07:44.561 --> 07:46.381
Wow, I'm clapping the
car, not the driving.

07:46.481 --> 07:50.381
- Ooh, I don't mind.

07:50.481 --> 07:53.061
- Think I've got a bit of car envy there.

07:53.161 --> 07:55.661
- I'm seriously thinking
of proposing to this car,

07:55.761 --> 07:56.541
I love it!

07:56.641 --> 07:57.861
- I'll tell you, it's
crass, it's in your face,

07:57.961 --> 08:00.141
but it's brilliant, look at it!

08:00.241 --> 08:03.261
- It's absolutely amazing.

08:03.361 --> 08:05.661
155 grand, how much?

08:05.761 --> 08:06.661
- 155 grand?

08:06.761 --> 08:07.501
- [PM] Yeah.

08:07.601 --> 08:09.021
- Maybe I've not got car envy.

08:09.121 --> 08:09.861
- Go on.

08:09.961 --> 08:10.701
- 155 grand?

08:10.801 --> 08:11.901
- Yeah.
- For an Alfa?

08:12.001 --> 08:12.901
- What's yours?

08:13.001 --> 08:14.341
- 150.

08:14.441 --> 08:15.701
- Not much difference.

08:15.801 --> 08:18.181
- The Atson's cheaper than the Alfa.

08:18.281 --> 08:20.901
- Well, you've gotta remember,
Fred, these are rare cars.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.941
You turn up to a track day in these,

08:23.041 --> 08:24.541
people come out of the woodwork,
they wanna talk to you.

08:24.641 --> 08:26.660
- Yeah, but you know what,
Paddy, you don't want them to.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.300
They come out of the woodwork.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.980
It'll be tyre compound,
it's about the springs.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.660
Mate, you don't wanna talk to them.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.260
Just wanna drive it, enjoy it.

08:35.360 --> 08:38.260
- Speaking of tire compounds,
where is Chris Harris?

08:38.360 --> 08:40.700
- Skidding around somewhere,
you know how he's like.

08:40.800 --> 08:45.800
- Now that is completely,
and utterly correct.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.140
(car skidding)

08:49.240 --> 08:50.380
Have some of that!

08:50.480 --> 08:53.340
(engine revving)

08:53.440 --> 08:55.060
Come on!

08:55.160 --> 08:59.900
Oh, look, put simply, for the money,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.500
you can't beat a Porsche
911 GT3 as a track special.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.380
If you wanna better it, you've
gotta go up a price bracket,

09:07.480 --> 09:10.020
or two, or three.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.219
(engine revving)

09:12.319 --> 09:15.059
(static music)

09:15.159 --> 09:17.659
Meet the reassuringly expensive,

09:17.759 --> 09:22.519
reassuringly outrageous, McLaren 765LT.

09:24.519 --> 09:26.899
With over 750 horsepower,

09:26.999 --> 09:30.219
and a top speed north
of 200 miles an hour,

09:30.319 --> 09:32.579
this isn't just one of
the very fastest cars

09:32.679 --> 09:37.279
McLaren has ever made, it's
also one of the most intense.

09:38.439 --> 09:41.199
(engine revving)

09:42.519 --> 09:44.299
- This isn't some friendly,

09:44.399 --> 09:47.099
let me help you with
that skid, sir super car.

09:47.199 --> 09:50.159
This thing is spiky, you
really are on your own.

09:51.119 --> 09:53.819
But that just adds to the sense of...

09:53.919 --> 09:56.099
(car skidding)

09:56.199 --> 09:58.198
Whoa ho ho, excitement!

09:59.678 --> 10:01.018
What a monster.

10:01.118 --> 10:03.858
(engine revving)

10:03.958 --> 10:07.338
Track day specials are not
meant to be relaxing and kind.

10:07.438 --> 10:10.218
They're supposed to keep
you right on your toes,

10:10.318 --> 10:13.338
and this thing, boy, does it do that.

10:13.438 --> 10:16.578
(car skidding)

10:16.678 --> 10:20.058
And that's because the 765LT sees

10:20.158 --> 10:22.498
all of McLaren's racing pedigree

10:22.598 --> 10:26.378
distilled into one very potent cocktail.

10:26.478 --> 10:30.098
Apart from the uprated ceramic
brakes, titanium exhaust,

10:30.198 --> 10:33.578
active rear wing and
acres of carbon fibre,

10:33.678 --> 10:37.018
the 765 is now lighter and more powerful

10:37.118 --> 10:40.498
than the already lightning-quick
720S it's based on.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.218
(engine revving)

10:42.318 --> 10:43.297
- And what this all adds up to,

10:43.397 --> 10:46.297
is a car that is shockingly first.

10:46.397 --> 10:49.157
(engine revving)

10:51.157 --> 10:53.157
Too fast for the road?

10:53.877 --> 10:55.697
I'd say so.

10:55.797 --> 10:58.017
To really get close to
what it's capable of,

10:58.117 --> 10:59.177
you've got to be on a circuit.

10:59.277 --> 11:02.337
(car skidding)

11:02.437 --> 11:03.657
And you'd better bring your A-game,

11:03.757 --> 11:08.757
and probably a spare pair of boxer shorts.

11:10.357 --> 11:12.017
Good lord!

11:12.117 --> 11:14.017
- Oh.

11:14.117 --> 11:16.717
(car skidding)

11:19.637 --> 11:21.657
- Yes, boys.

11:21.757 --> 11:24.537
- Don't tell him, that was pretty good.

11:24.637 --> 11:28.457
- All right, lads, now
this is my kind of day.

11:28.557 --> 11:31.176
Proper geeky track day
specials, look at that!

11:31.276 --> 11:31.976
(laughs)

11:32.076 --> 11:33.816
- It's a bit of you, innit, this.

11:33.916 --> 11:34.656
- Ahh.

11:34.756 --> 11:35.496
- How much?

11:35.596 --> 11:39.456
- 280 grand, because
to beat a GT3 Porsche,

11:39.556 --> 11:41.056
you've gotta spend 280 grand.

11:41.156 --> 11:42.016
- Yeah, but with you

11:42.116 --> 11:44.256
there's always a few extras, isn't there?

11:44.356 --> 11:45.816
- 400.

11:45.916 --> 11:49.096
- 400 thousand pounds?

11:49.196 --> 11:50.576
- So, more than a few extras,
that, 400 grand?

11:50.676 --> 11:51.416
- 400?

11:51.516 --> 11:53.816
- It looks like a
400-thousand-pound car, look at it.

11:53.916 --> 11:55.776
- For 400 grand you
could buy both of these

11:55.876 --> 11:58.876
and still have enough over
to get some decent T-shirts.

11:59.756 --> 12:01.456
Right, 400 thousand pounds.

12:01.556 --> 12:03.536
Let's see what that'll buy you.

12:03.636 --> 12:05.336
Time for a drag race.

12:05.436 --> 12:06.496
- A drag race?

12:06.596 --> 12:07.416
Totally irrelevant.

12:07.516 --> 12:09.576
- I know, but bit of fun innit?

12:09.676 --> 12:11.676
Bit of fun!

12:12.076 --> 12:14.836
(suspense music)

12:18.635 --> 12:21.135
- So gentlemen, basic
drag race, and Chris,

12:21.235 --> 12:22.775
if by the time and Fred get up there,

12:22.875 --> 12:23.695
you have not pulled up,

12:23.795 --> 12:26.055
got out and had a cup of
tea, there's something wrong.

12:26.155 --> 12:29.915
- This will do 0-120 miles
an hour in seven seconds.

12:31.595 --> 12:33.695
- Come on, Harris, let's
see what you've got.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.795
(suspenseful music)

12:44.875 --> 12:47.055
(engine revving)

12:47.155 --> 12:49.555
- [Crew] Three, two, one, go!

12:51.235 --> 12:52.655
(engine revving)

12:52.755 --> 12:53.855
- Oh, he's off!

12:53.955 --> 12:56.035
(laughs)

12:57.795 --> 13:00.115
- Ohh, that McLaren is gone!

13:02.474 --> 13:04.174
- Come on, the Aston.

13:04.274 --> 13:06.254
I can't even see them!

13:06.354 --> 13:08.734
- Oh, coming back on the Aston!

13:08.834 --> 13:09.774
- Come on.

13:09.874 --> 13:11.574
- Here we go.

13:11.674 --> 13:13.674
- Look at the McLaren.

13:14.434 --> 13:19.434
- 160, 170,180, dearie me,
the speed is outrageous.

13:24.514 --> 13:27.274
(engine revving)

13:30.874 --> 13:34.054
- Pretty much 200 over the line, wow!

13:34.154 --> 13:35.774
- First loser, baby!

13:35.874 --> 13:37.874
- Jeez!

13:39.594 --> 13:41.494
- [Paddy] In surprise order then,

13:41.594 --> 13:45.094
the Alfa had beaten the
Aston to second place.

13:45.194 --> 13:46.734
- [FF] Magnifico!

13:46.834 --> 13:48.173
- [FF] Do you know what, Pad?

13:48.273 --> 13:50.293
I can't even be unhappy for you.

13:50.393 --> 13:52.933
- [Paddy] Harris's McLaren
had smashed the both of us.

13:53.033 --> 13:56.093
- Sometimes straight-line speed is boring,

13:56.193 --> 13:58.453
but not when it's that fast.

13:58.553 --> 14:01.533
- [Paddy] And the producers
had decided a drag race

14:01.633 --> 14:05.873
was not the best way to test
our three track specialists.

14:07.433 --> 14:08.413
- Challenge, Pad.

14:08.513 --> 14:10.053
- Can we just confirm who won?

14:10.153 --> 14:11.813
- Yeah, but it was obvious
that was gonna happen.

14:11.913 --> 14:12.653
Shall I read this?

14:12.753 --> 14:15.893
- Can we just say as well, he
won by about three seconds,

14:15.993 --> 14:17.253
but if you put that into pounds and pence,

14:17.353 --> 14:20.653
so he's paid 245 thousand
pounds more than my car

14:20.753 --> 14:22.333
and it gave him three seconds back.

14:22.433 --> 14:23.653
Value for money, that.

14:23.753 --> 14:24.533
- Here we go.

14:24.633 --> 14:25.893
Since the best track special

14:25.993 --> 14:28.333
should make you feel like
a hero around the circuit,

14:28.433 --> 14:32.013
you will now find out what
yours can do, at a track day.

14:32.113 --> 14:33.452
- Yes, very nice.

14:33.552 --> 14:34.612
That is more like it.

14:34.712 --> 14:36.092
None of this drag race nonsense.

14:36.192 --> 14:37.772
- Well, he's got an
advantage on the track,

14:37.872 --> 14:38.632
'cause everyone will be behind him going,

14:38.712 --> 14:41.532
oh, it's the safety car, let's go slow.

14:41.632 --> 14:42.772
So he can hold everyone back

14:42.872 --> 14:46.132
while me and you have a good
razz around, Christopher.

14:46.232 --> 14:48.552
- [Chris] Well, yes and no,

14:51.112 --> 14:55.652
because it turned out the
track day we'd been sent to,

14:55.752 --> 14:58.712
was the Formula 1 British Grand Prix.

15:01.032 --> 15:02.212
(engine revving)

15:02.312 --> 15:04.812
Every year, Silverstone circuit plays host

15:04.912 --> 15:07.732
to the fastest cars on the planet,

15:07.832 --> 15:09.252
all racing for glory

15:09.352 --> 15:12.192
in front of hundreds of thousands of fans.

15:14.352 --> 15:17.972
The jewel in the crown of the
British Motorsport calendar.

15:18.072 --> 15:21.831
As track days go, this is a big one.

15:26.111 --> 15:27.891
- F1 weekend at Silverstone boys.

15:27.991 --> 15:30.651
This is serious stuff.

15:30.751 --> 15:33.211
- I feel like we've signed
up for a game of five aside

15:33.311 --> 15:37.111
and somehow ended up in an
FA Cup final at Wembley.

15:38.351 --> 15:39.411
- [FF] How excited are you, Chris?

15:39.511 --> 15:40.531
You love the F1.

15:40.631 --> 15:43.251
- Any driver that can handle
one of those machines,

15:43.351 --> 15:46.611
surrounded by 20 similar
nutcases is a hero in my book.

15:46.711 --> 15:48.991
They're all heroes, even
the ones at the back.

15:51.591 --> 15:54.351
(engine revving)

15:57.511 --> 15:59.211
The question was though,

15:59.311 --> 16:02.711
what on earth were we even doing there.

16:04.431 --> 16:09.210
- [PM] Oh lads, we're only
rolling onto the track!

16:09.310 --> 16:10.890
- Are you sure we should
be on here, Paddy?

16:10.990 --> 16:13.370
- I'm not, Fred, I'm really not.

16:13.470 --> 16:15.790
- [Fred] I feel like I'm trespassing.

16:19.030 --> 16:21.030
- There's a crowd on for our track day.

16:27.030 --> 16:29.910
- Formula 1 drivers, three of them.

16:32.910 --> 16:36.210
So, because our track specials
were all made by companies

16:36.310 --> 16:38.850
that also happen to run F1 teams,

16:38.950 --> 16:42.370
we'd been told we'd be
taking on their drivers

16:42.470 --> 16:44.970
in a relay race.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.830
From Aston Martin, Sebastian Vettel.

16:49.990 --> 16:53.229
From Alfa Romeo, Antonio Giovinazzi.

16:55.189 --> 16:57.869
And from McLaren, Lando Norris.

16:59.389 --> 17:02.289
Three of the finest racing
drivers in the world,

17:02.389 --> 17:04.389
against us lot.

17:05.589 --> 17:06.809
- [PM] Ahh.

17:06.909 --> 17:09.409
(crowd cheering)

17:09.509 --> 17:11.509
- [FF] Wow.

17:11.949 --> 17:13.649
- [PM] Lads.

17:13.749 --> 17:15.769
- Gents, thank you so much for taking time

17:15.869 --> 17:20.409
out of your busy weekend
to presumably humiliate us.

17:20.509 --> 17:21.249
- No worries.

17:21.349 --> 17:22.729
- Are you looking forward
to driving these cars?

17:22.829 --> 17:24.889
- Yes, of course, if you warm them up.

17:24.989 --> 17:26.969
- Very, very simple, lads.

17:27.069 --> 17:28.409
It's a relay race.

17:28.509 --> 17:31.049
Sebastian, you'll start
us off in the Aston.

17:31.149 --> 17:33.609
One lap of the track,
you'll come back in here,

17:33.709 --> 17:35.369
and you'll touch the bonnet of the Alfa.

17:35.469 --> 17:37.368
This is the important part.

17:37.468 --> 17:38.848
- Don't get run over.

17:38.948 --> 17:41.648
Antonio, you'll then set
off, you'll do your lap,

17:41.748 --> 17:42.528
you'll come back in,

17:42.628 --> 17:44.888
come over to your
McLaren touch the bonnet.

17:44.988 --> 17:47.768
Lando, you will then setoff my friend,

17:47.868 --> 17:49.328
do your lap come in here,

17:49.428 --> 17:52.088
and that's when we stop
the clock, simple enough?

17:52.188 --> 17:52.928
- Think so.

17:53.028 --> 17:55.248
- Right lads, you're gonna
lay down the benchmark,

17:55.348 --> 17:59.568
and us three are gonna see
how close we can get to you.

17:59.668 --> 18:01.768
- All right, Sebastian,
get yourself in Cocker.

18:01.868 --> 18:03.368
- I've gotta start. All right.

18:03.468 --> 18:05.528
- Here we go, come on.

18:05.628 --> 18:06.928
- Have you seen how thin they are?

18:07.028 --> 18:07.768
- Very thin.
- Yeah.

18:07.868 --> 18:08.608
- Seen how thin they...

18:08.708 --> 18:09.408
Seen how thin they are?

18:09.508 --> 18:11.508
- Very thin.

18:16.508 --> 18:19.668
- I think this old men have no chance.

18:23.067 --> 18:24.967
- [PM] Sebastian, are you ready?

18:25.067 --> 18:27.067
- I'm ready.

18:27.547 --> 18:29.547
- Three, two, one, go!

18:33.147 --> 18:34.807
(engine revving)

18:34.907 --> 18:36.327
- Oh, he's off, he's off.

18:36.427 --> 18:38.047
- Good start.

18:38.147 --> 18:39.727
- Oh my word.

18:39.827 --> 18:40.647
- Follow that line.

18:40.747 --> 18:42.167
- Have you been round here before?

18:42.267 --> 18:43.007
- Never, have you?

18:43.107 --> 18:44.207
- Never.

18:44.307 --> 18:47.067
(engine revving)

18:50.227 --> 18:51.407
- Get yourself ready, Antonio.

18:51.507 --> 18:54.407
- Lando, what would you
go round in an F1 car?

18:54.507 --> 18:56.207
- 1.26.

18:56.307 --> 18:57.007
- Oh dear God.

18:57.107 --> 18:59.087
- Oh Jesus Christ.

18:59.187 --> 19:03.407
- Here we go, Cobbs Corner,
my favourite round here.

19:03.507 --> 19:06.767
(engine revving)

19:06.867 --> 19:07.767
- God, he's not messing about is he?

19:07.867 --> 19:09.966
- We won't be going round
quite as quick as that.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.166
- He's not messing about.

19:11.266 --> 19:14.446
- Now is the best section ever.

19:14.546 --> 19:19.546
Maggots (indistinct) Becketts, and Chapel.

19:21.466 --> 19:22.686
- High-speed corners.

19:22.786 --> 19:23.606
What G do you pull?

19:23.706 --> 19:25.206
- Er five.

19:25.306 --> 19:26.406
- Five, five Gs?

19:26.506 --> 19:28.506
- Five and a half?

19:29.266 --> 19:30.286
- Here he comes.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.466
Don't forget, he's gotta tap the bonnet.

19:34.306 --> 19:35.286
- Oh, it's the change over.

19:35.386 --> 19:36.446
This is where we get our time back.

19:36.546 --> 19:37.966
- That's not the bonnet!

19:38.066 --> 19:40.166
That's not the bonnet! (indistinct).

19:40.266 --> 19:41.166
- 10 seconds!

19:41.266 --> 19:43.266
- He thought it was rear-engined.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.086
- Whoa.

19:48.186 --> 19:50.906
(engine revving)

19:57.225 --> 19:58.445
Look at the Alpha.

19:58.545 --> 19:59.245
How beautiful is that?

19:59.345 --> 20:00.205
- Good car, ain't it?

20:00.305 --> 20:01.045
Go on, Lando.

20:01.145 --> 20:01.885
- Get yourself ready, Lando.

20:01.985 --> 20:03.985
Go on, son.

20:07.705 --> 20:09.905
- Those tyres are suitably warmed up now.

20:11.265 --> 20:13.265
- It's a good lap.

20:13.825 --> 20:14.565
- Here he comes.

20:14.665 --> 20:15.365
- Here he comes.

20:15.465 --> 20:16.685
- [All] Ohh!

20:16.785 --> 20:18.005
- It's all about the change over.

20:18.105 --> 20:22.245
- It's all about the
baton, all about the baton.

20:22.345 --> 20:24.345
- He's done it again!

20:25.625 --> 20:27.285
- Oh my word.

20:27.385 --> 20:28.565
- He's gone.

20:28.665 --> 20:32.585
- Oh my god, I've never
driven this car before.

20:34.225 --> 20:36.545
It's quicker than I thought.

20:39.665 --> 20:41.664
- How was that, pal?

20:42.104 --> 20:43.364
- How was it?

20:43.464 --> 20:44.404
- It's hard, but...

20:44.504 --> 20:45.204
- It's hard, huh?

20:45.304 --> 20:46.404
- Yeah.
- It's heavy?

20:46.504 --> 20:48.804
You drive like this.

20:48.904 --> 20:49.644
- Oh what a beast.

20:49.744 --> 20:52.504
(engine revving)

21:01.424 --> 21:02.924
- That does look quick.

21:03.024 --> 21:05.024
- 'Cause he is quick.

21:07.984 --> 21:08.684
Oh, he's using it all.

21:08.784 --> 21:10.844
- Right over there.

21:10.944 --> 21:12.944
- Holy moley.

21:15.944 --> 21:16.804
- Oh, here he comes.

21:16.904 --> 21:18.904
- Let's cheer him on.

21:19.584 --> 21:21.584
- Whoa, whoa, bloody hell! (indistinct).

21:23.384 --> 21:25.164
- Ohh!

21:25.264 --> 21:27.483
- See how fast that was going?

21:27.583 --> 21:29.743
- Ohh, that looked lively.

21:32.423 --> 21:35.183
(car screeching)

21:38.943 --> 21:40.603
- What's he doing?

21:40.703 --> 21:42.003
- Oh, you see.

21:42.103 --> 21:44.103
- I've gotta drive that.

21:47.263 --> 21:50.023
(crowd cheering)

21:53.223 --> 21:55.223
- Ah.

21:56.463 --> 21:58.463
- Ah, well done.

21:59.983 --> 22:00.843
- Easy.

22:00.943 --> 22:03.083
- Lando, what is it with
young lads and donuts?

22:03.183 --> 22:04.403
You can't resist, can you?

22:04.503 --> 22:06.503
- No man, I couldn't.

22:07.343 --> 22:08.043
- Ok, got the times lads.

22:08.143 --> 22:08.903
- Come on then, what have you got?

22:08.983 --> 22:10.203
- What have we got?

22:10.303 --> 22:15.362
- Team F1, your combined time was 7.31.62.

22:15.462 --> 22:17.642
- To be honest, for three
laps that's not too bad, yeah.

22:17.742 --> 22:19.082
- Not so bad.
- Yeah.

22:19.182 --> 22:20.602
- Obviously we are not going to beat that.

22:20.702 --> 22:21.562
We are two middle-aged men

22:21.662 --> 22:23.082
from Lancashire and one from Bristol.

22:23.182 --> 22:24.042
- Yeah exactly.

22:24.142 --> 22:24.882
- How we doing that?

22:24.982 --> 22:26.802
- We are gonna need five
or 10 seconds or something.

22:26.902 --> 22:27.842
What will you give us?

22:27.942 --> 22:29.882
- What are we going to give them?

22:29.982 --> 22:30.962
10 seconds each?

22:31.062 --> 22:32.682
- How much older are they?

22:32.782 --> 22:34.202
- A lot, a lot, a lot.

22:34.302 --> 22:35.202
- A lot, and fatter.

22:35.302 --> 22:36.922
- 30 seconds is embarrassing.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.562
- Shut it, we'll take it.

22:38.662 --> 22:39.402
- We wanted 40.

22:39.502 --> 22:40.282
- 31.

22:40.382 --> 22:43.442
(all cheering)

22:43.542 --> 22:45.362
- Let's see what they think, 31?

22:45.462 --> 22:46.602
(crowd cheering)

22:46.702 --> 22:47.442
- Yeah, there you go.

22:47.542 --> 22:48.922
31, that's a good one.

22:49.022 --> 22:50.042
- Right, we know what we've gotta do.

22:50.142 --> 22:51.242
Fred, you're up first, son.

22:51.342 --> 22:53.162
Go on, knock them dead, knock them dead.

22:53.262 --> 22:54.082
- I'm nervous.

22:54.182 --> 22:56.942
(crowd cheering)

22:59.701 --> 23:04.161
- Just to be clear in a sport
where every hundredth counts,

23:04.261 --> 23:08.261
a 31-second handicap
is a shamefully long time.

23:09.501 --> 23:11.361
But while eight minutes and two seconds,

23:11.461 --> 23:13.601
was now the target to beat,

23:13.701 --> 23:17.281
with two of our team having
never driven the track before,

23:17.381 --> 23:19.561
there was also the very real question

23:19.661 --> 23:21.661
of whether we'd even finish.

23:24.781 --> 23:26.781
- Okay, Freddy, are you ready, son?

23:27.621 --> 23:29.441
- I think so, Pad.

23:29.541 --> 23:32.201
- (laughs) All right, do
it for the middle-aged men.

23:32.301 --> 23:34.321
Here we go.

23:34.421 --> 23:36.421
- Three, two, one, go.

23:41.141 --> 23:43.781
First corner's and right-hander,
it's a right-hander.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.320
- [FF] I've no idea where I'm going.

23:46.420 --> 23:48.200
- [CH] The next corner's a left-hander.

23:48.300 --> 23:49.560
- I'm gonna get in already.

23:49.660 --> 23:51.660
- After the right, there's a left.

23:54.300 --> 23:55.280
- Come on keep going.

23:55.380 --> 23:57.380
I'm only up against Sebastian Vettel.

24:02.980 --> 24:04.480
- I think he's doing really well.

24:04.580 --> 24:05.320
- Do you?

24:05.420 --> 24:07.040
- Yeah.

24:07.140 --> 24:08.360
- Come on!

24:08.460 --> 24:10.800
Get on, get on, get on.

24:10.900 --> 24:12.900
Get some speed up.

24:15.740 --> 24:19.640
- All of a sudden, the
suit feels a lot tighter,

24:19.740 --> 24:21.740
and the car feels a lot heavier.

24:26.180 --> 24:28.180
- Get round.

24:29.620 --> 24:30.359
- Come on, Fred.

24:30.459 --> 24:31.439
Come on, Fred.

24:31.539 --> 24:33.399
- Brake, brake, brake.

24:33.499 --> 24:37.939
- Oh, he's not going in the
back of me, that's alright.

24:42.539 --> 24:44.759
- What's the (bleep) going on?

24:44.859 --> 24:45.599
- Go! Go!

24:45.699 --> 24:47.399
- The breaks!

24:47.499 --> 24:50.599
- Oh my god, He can't
get the handbrake off.

24:50.699 --> 24:52.699
- What's going on?

24:53.939 --> 24:55.239
- Ho, ho, ho!

24:55.339 --> 24:57.339
- What's going on?

25:01.539 --> 25:05.019
(laughs)

25:08.219 --> 25:10.799
- He is a clown.
- Absolute muppet, that lad.

25:12.899 --> 25:15.919
- What was going on
with that parking brake?

25:16.019 --> 25:20.478
Oh, that nearly caught me out.

25:20.578 --> 25:22.578
- Come on Chris.

25:26.258 --> 25:27.398
- 140, I'm in the wrong gear.

25:27.498 --> 25:30.938
Oh god, oh, come on Alfa.

25:32.378 --> 25:34.558
Right let's get flat out here.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.658
Get some time back, for god's sake.

25:38.458 --> 25:43.458
Harris needs to be absolutely mustard now.

25:43.898 --> 25:45.638
- Come on, Pad.

25:45.738 --> 25:47.738
Where is he now?

25:49.578 --> 25:50.998
- Chris will be good.

25:51.098 --> 25:56.098
- Oh my god.

26:01.618 --> 26:02.917
- Oi, oi, oi.

26:03.017 --> 26:03.877
- It wouldn't go!

26:03.977 --> 26:05.677
Not the parking brake, I'm
like, what's going on?

26:05.777 --> 26:06.477
- Handbrake, handbrake.

26:06.577 --> 26:07.337
You just embarrassed yourself

26:07.417 --> 26:08.217
in front of three world-class drivers.

26:08.297 --> 26:10.377
- Sorry about that, lads.

26:12.497 --> 26:14.557
- [FF] McGuinness's
issues on the start line

26:14.657 --> 26:17.357
had cost a whole heap of time.

26:17.457 --> 26:20.837
- I couldn't believe that (indistinct).

26:20.937 --> 26:22.077
- Really high-pitched voice.

26:22.177 --> 26:23.397
It wouldn't go mate.

26:23.497 --> 26:24.557
- Why won't it go?

26:24.657 --> 26:26.317
- I took my foot off the
brakes, it wouldn't go.

26:26.417 --> 26:29.117
(all laughing)

26:29.217 --> 26:30.797
- Antonio stitched me up!

26:30.897 --> 26:34.157
(audience laughing)

26:34.257 --> 26:37.117
- [FF] It was now all on Harris
to wring everything he could

26:37.217 --> 26:40.217
out of his McLaren to
keep us in the running.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.517
- I think he's made up for
some of your lost I'm here.

26:45.617 --> 26:46.397
- Yeah, thank God.

26:46.497 --> 26:48.676
- Right, here he comes.

26:48.776 --> 26:50.776
- Get back everyone.

26:54.936 --> 26:55.716
Fast uh?

26:55.816 --> 26:56.556
- Yeah.

26:56.656 --> 26:58.656
- That was close to you.

26:59.496 --> 27:03.356
- We'd all made it round,
which was a result in itself.

27:03.456 --> 27:06.316
- Go on, Chrissie Harris.

27:06.416 --> 27:09.836
(crowd applauding)

27:09.936 --> 27:13.036
- [FF] But that did of
course leave the small matter

27:13.136 --> 27:15.116
of our time.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.316
- Oh, come on, Pad, here we go.

27:17.416 --> 27:18.276
- Here we go.

27:18.376 --> 27:19.756
- Come on, Pad.
- Right now.

27:19.856 --> 27:20.716
- Yeah.

27:20.816 --> 27:24.036
- So lads, you did it in 7.31.62.

27:24.136 --> 27:27.496
You give us 31, that takes you to 8.02.62.

27:28.656 --> 27:31.256
We did it in 8.24.34, ahh!

27:35.615 --> 27:36.715
- Miles off!

27:36.815 --> 27:37.615
- I feel as though that 10 seconds,

27:37.695 --> 27:39.035
I were trying to get the handbrake off.

27:39.135 --> 27:40.835
- 10, that was like at least 30 seconds.

27:40.935 --> 27:42.475
- But what a pleasure to
be beat by these guys.

27:42.575 --> 27:43.635
(crowd applauding)

27:43.735 --> 27:44.475
- Yeah, thanks so much.

27:44.575 --> 27:45.455
- Cheers, boys.
- Thank you very much.

27:45.535 --> 27:47.875
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you so much, lads.

27:47.975 --> 27:50.775
(crowd cheering)

28:05.215 --> 28:07.835
- I was dying for you there, Pad, dying.

28:07.935 --> 28:09.755
- I was until I thought, if that had been me,

28:09.855 --> 28:12.475
McGuinness would have just
dined out on it forever.

28:14.575 --> 28:18.045
- (laughs) I still think
Antonio stiffed me.

28:18.055 --> 28:20.154
(all laughing)

28:20.254 --> 28:23.154
(crowd cheering)

28:23.254 --> 28:25.514
- Oh, we got hammered, boys.

28:25.614 --> 28:27.074
- We did, but what a day, come on.

28:27.174 --> 28:27.874
- Unbelievable.

28:27.974 --> 28:28.714
- F1 weekend.

28:28.814 --> 28:31.954
- We got to drive F1
weekend at Silverstone.

28:32.054 --> 28:33.394
People would give their right hand for that.

28:33.494 --> 28:34.234
It was an amazing day.

28:34.334 --> 28:35.154
- It was a treat.

28:35.254 --> 28:36.514
- It was spectacular.

28:36.614 --> 28:39.154
- Although I was packed into
that suit, I've gotta say.

28:39.254 --> 28:40.194
- No one noticed, Pad.

28:40.294 --> 28:42.074
Now, we might have lost to the F1 guys,

28:42.174 --> 28:44.354
but I've been drilling into the data.

28:44.454 --> 28:45.634
- Ooh.
- Really?

28:45.734 --> 28:47.434
- You know I love a bit of data.

28:47.534 --> 28:48.714
You know what caught my eye?

28:48.814 --> 28:49.554
- Go on.

28:49.654 --> 28:52.314
- The two lap times of the McLaren.

28:52.414 --> 28:55.874
Lando Norris, F1 ace,
future world champion,

28:55.974 --> 28:58.554
against our very own Chrissie Harris,

28:58.654 --> 29:00.474
sturdy lad from Bristol,

29:00.574 --> 29:01.474
oh look at that.

29:01.574 --> 29:02.954
(all laughing)

29:03.054 --> 29:06.113
- Who wants to know how
close the lap times were?

29:06.213 --> 29:07.473
- Yeah.

29:07.573 --> 29:08.593
- [Audience] Yeah.

29:08.693 --> 29:09.393
- Yes.

29:09.493 --> 29:10.233
- Not sure Chris does.
- No.

29:10.333 --> 29:15.473
- But Lando's lap, two minutes 17 seconds.

29:15.573 --> 29:16.513
- Wow.

29:16.613 --> 29:17.793
- [Audience] Ohh.

29:17.893 --> 29:22.653
- Now, Chris' lap,
two minutes 18 seconds.

29:24.533 --> 29:27.153
He only beat him by one second.

29:27.253 --> 29:28.753
- Wow, one second, one second.

29:28.853 --> 29:29.753
(crowd cheering)

29:29.853 --> 29:31.273
- Pound for pound you're faster.

29:31.373 --> 29:32.153
- Wow.

29:32.253 --> 29:34.273
- Adjusted for weight, it's panto season.

29:34.373 --> 29:37.133
(crowd cheering)

29:38.293 --> 29:39.313
- He's milking it.

29:39.413 --> 29:42.673
- Let's hear it for fat lads everywhere.

29:42.773 --> 29:43.593
- Never hear end of it.

29:43.693 --> 29:45.153
- Let's hear it for fat lads (laughs).

29:45.253 --> 29:46.073
- Never hear end of it.

29:46.173 --> 29:48.033
- Adjusted for weight, I'm
claiming that as a draw.

29:48.133 --> 29:52.872
- Oh, I say one second, that
my friend is proper impressive.

29:52.972 --> 29:55.032
Which baffles me why he
doesn't win many challenges.

29:55.132 --> 29:57.212
(laughs)

29:58.372 --> 29:59.792
- Handbrake.

29:59.892 --> 30:02.192
- Yeah, yeah, bit of a
technical, I'm gutted.

30:02.292 --> 30:03.032
- Really?

30:03.132 --> 30:05.232
- But it's not as though
it was at Silverstone

30:05.332 --> 30:08.752
in front of three F1 drivers
and thousands of people,

30:08.852 --> 30:09.592
so it was all right.

30:09.692 --> 30:10.632
I got away with that one.

30:10.732 --> 30:12.512
- We should finally put the Diablo to bed.

30:12.612 --> 30:15.312
- Yes, every cloud has a-

30:15.412 --> 30:17.152
- That is a burn!

30:17.252 --> 30:18.552
- See the one thing I will give you tough,

30:18.652 --> 30:20.432
Pad, is your choice of car.

30:20.532 --> 30:22.592
The Aston, it's all right.

30:22.692 --> 30:23.432
- Yeah.

30:23.532 --> 30:25.712
- But the Alfa, I love
it, absolutely love it.

30:25.812 --> 30:26.552
- This is what I mean.

30:26.652 --> 30:27.912
You're saying the Aston it's kind of...

30:28.012 --> 30:30.632
It's all right, you're
dismissing it because of this.

30:30.732 --> 30:32.672
- Come on, don't forget
this, it's a monster.

30:32.772 --> 30:34.752
- That is unbelievably fast.

30:34.852 --> 30:35.592
- A weapon.

30:35.692 --> 30:36.752
- Absolute weapon.

30:36.852 --> 30:37.991
Right, it's time to move on

30:38.091 --> 30:39.831
to something a little bit more personal.

30:39.931 --> 30:42.111
They say never meet your heroes.

30:42.211 --> 30:45.151
Well I did and it was one of
the best things I've ever done.

30:45.251 --> 30:47.251
Take a look at this.

30:48.691 --> 30:50.191
(television buzzing)

30:50.291 --> 30:58.291
- [Kid] It's an Evel
Knievel rally, far out. Wow!

30:59.171 --> 31:01.851
(kids cheering)

31:03.091 --> 31:07.751
- (chuckles) Now, back in the
day when I was a little lad,

31:07.851 --> 31:10.191
this was the toy to have.

31:10.291 --> 31:12.991
The Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle.

31:13.091 --> 31:14.751
And I know it doesn't look much now,

31:14.851 --> 31:18.311
but this could turn any
living room or any pavement

31:18.411 --> 31:20.551
into your very own stunt show.

31:20.651 --> 31:23.211
(upbeat music)

31:25.930 --> 31:27.790
Evel Knievel, was the world's

31:27.890 --> 31:30.430
most famous motorcycle daredevil.

31:30.530 --> 31:33.090
(upbeat music)

31:38.410 --> 31:41.550
Known for his huge death-defying jumps,

31:41.650 --> 31:43.550
every time he got on a bike,

31:43.650 --> 31:45.870
he would either break a new world record,

31:45.970 --> 31:48.970
or break himself trying.

31:54.490 --> 31:56.830
But the truth was growing
up here in Bolton,

31:56.930 --> 31:59.630
Evel Knievel wasn't really real.

31:59.730 --> 32:00.950
He wasn't on British TV.

32:01.050 --> 32:02.350
There was no YouTube.

32:02.450 --> 32:03.710
And he lived in America,

32:03.810 --> 32:07.230
which to me and my mates was
a completely different world.

32:07.330 --> 32:09.190
What we needed in this country

32:09.290 --> 32:12.069
was a true blue daredevil superstar

32:12.169 --> 32:14.169
that we could call our own.

32:15.009 --> 32:16.269
- [Announcer] Here comes Eddie Kidd.

32:16.369 --> 32:17.269
(kids cheering)

32:17.369 --> 32:19.309
He's done it, incredible!

32:19.409 --> 32:21.269
- [Announcer 2] Daredevil
champion of the world,

32:21.369 --> 32:22.829
Britain's Eddie Kidd!

32:22.929 --> 32:24.309
- [Paddy] How are you doing?

32:24.409 --> 32:25.149
- [Man] Good mate, how are you?

32:25.249 --> 32:27.709
- I'm good, my name is Stephen Flaherty.

32:27.809 --> 32:29.349
I'm from London.

32:29.449 --> 32:31.449
And I grew up with Eddie Kidd.

32:33.249 --> 32:36.429
- I'm Christine Morris, Eddie's sister.

32:36.529 --> 32:40.109
- I'm Marjorie Kidd and
I'm Eddie Kidd's mum

32:40.209 --> 32:42.929
for the last 61 years (laughs).

32:44.729 --> 32:46.429
(suspenseful music)

32:46.529 --> 32:50.329
He always had a little bike,
he used to cycle everywhere.

32:52.249 --> 32:56.188
He was always sort of climbing
and running and jumping.

32:56.288 --> 32:57.828
- We used to go to the cinema quite a lot,

32:57.928 --> 32:59.348
used to go late night cinema.

32:59.448 --> 33:01.768
We went to see a film on Evel Knievel.

33:03.008 --> 33:04.628
- [Christine] And that was it,

33:04.728 --> 33:07.828
they were absolutely hooked on it.

33:07.928 --> 33:10.188
- That's just something
that we both wanted to be.

33:10.288 --> 33:12.288
We just both wanted to be Evel Knievel.

33:14.968 --> 33:17.428
- So this young lad, Eddie Kidd,

33:17.528 --> 33:19.988
he's riding around North London on his BMX

33:20.088 --> 33:21.428
with all his mates,

33:21.528 --> 33:24.468
doing jumps and pretending
to be a daredevil.

33:24.568 --> 33:27.708
And then one day, he gets on a motorcycle.

33:27.808 --> 33:31.108
And then everything changes.

33:31.208 --> 33:33.628
(suspenseful music)

33:33.728 --> 33:35.548
- [Christine] He was
never frightened, Eddie.

33:35.648 --> 33:40.168
He never, ever showed fear at all, never.

33:41.927 --> 33:45.827
- We used to go to a place in
East London called Eton Manor,

33:45.927 --> 33:47.187
we used to practice there.

33:47.287 --> 33:49.867
We'd had a couple of guys
come from the Royal Artillery,

33:49.967 --> 33:51.427
the manager at the time,
the owner,

33:51.527 --> 33:53.707
he had some T-shirts made up

33:53.807 --> 33:56.027
of somebody jumping a bus long ways.

33:56.127 --> 33:59.067
Us being kids we always
said no no one can do that,

33:59.167 --> 34:01.267
only Evel Knievel, he's the only one.

34:01.367 --> 34:03.547
The guy that was doing it at the time,

34:03.647 --> 34:06.147
he came up short a couple of times.

34:06.247 --> 34:09.447
- So, Eddie was sitting
there on his little bike.

34:10.887 --> 34:12.547
And he said, "I'll do that."

34:12.647 --> 34:14.647
Oh, shut up, don't be silly.

34:15.207 --> 34:17.987
But he kept saying, can I do it?

34:18.087 --> 34:18.827
Can I do it?

34:18.927 --> 34:20.107
- And he said yeah, go on then,

34:20.207 --> 34:22.527
as a joke.

34:25.646 --> 34:28.626
And Eddie did it.

34:28.726 --> 34:33.026
He'd done it. It was amazing,
we couldn't believe it.

34:33.126 --> 34:33.866
- And from then,

34:33.966 --> 34:36.126
he became the star of
the show from then on.

34:37.646 --> 34:39.846
- [Paddy] Eddie was unleashed.

34:41.366 --> 34:45.746
In 1975, still just 16 years old,

34:45.846 --> 34:50.406
he jumped 13 double decker
buses, a new world record.

34:51.526 --> 34:54.286
(engine revving)

34:55.406 --> 34:58.686
Three years later, he cleared 14 buses.

34:59.846 --> 35:02.406
(upbeat music)

35:04.206 --> 35:06.706
Eddie was quickly proving himself

35:06.806 --> 35:11.806
to be one of the most skilful
riders ever to wield a bike.

35:12.606 --> 35:16.505
- He just had hand-to-eye
coordination that was phenomenal.

35:16.605 --> 35:19.265
He could have been a top
golfer, tennis player,

35:19.365 --> 35:20.985
anything else he'd set his mind to.

35:21.085 --> 35:23.685
(upbeat music)

35:24.565 --> 35:26.785
- So here, we have this super talented lad

35:26.885 --> 35:30.385
doing things on a bike the
world had never seen before.

35:30.485 --> 35:32.905
But that wasn't the end
of the story for Eddie,

35:33.005 --> 35:35.545
this was a bloke, who had it all.

35:35.645 --> 35:38.245
(upbeat music)

35:42.325 --> 35:45.025
- He was a pinup of such proportions.

35:45.125 --> 35:47.385
I mean, he was over
all the girls' bedrooms

35:47.485 --> 35:49.745
and he was on every magazine.

35:49.845 --> 35:51.845
He was as big as the pop stars.

35:53.645 --> 35:56.145
- If I say hordes of girls,
I'm not exaggerating.

35:56.245 --> 35:57.545
Everywhere you went it was,

35:57.645 --> 35:58.865
"Eddie Kidd, Eddie Kidd, Eddie Kidd."

35:58.965 --> 35:59.944
- Eddie Kidd.
- Eddie Kidd.

36:00.044 --> 36:02.044
- Eddie Kidd.

36:02.364 --> 36:04.864
- [Paddy] His rise was meteoric.

36:04.964 --> 36:06.664
- I don't really think I'm sexy.

36:06.764 --> 36:07.704
- Oh, come on.

36:07.804 --> 36:09.304
- [Paddy] Eddie became the face,

36:09.404 --> 36:11.984
or rather the rear, of Levi jeans.

36:12.084 --> 36:14.784
Vivienne Westwood designed
his bike leathers.

36:14.884 --> 36:17.904
And of course, those looks
and a talent like none other,

36:18.004 --> 36:22.264
meant Hollywood wanted
a piece of the Kidd too.

36:22.364 --> 36:26.384
- Double for James Bond,
Harrison Ford, Michael Douglas.

36:26.484 --> 36:30.364
Doubled for Richard Gere in
"First Knight" on the horse.

36:32.124 --> 36:36.584
- [Paddy] Eddie even starred
in 1981's "Riding High",

36:36.684 --> 36:40.144
where naturally, his first
full silver screen debut

36:40.244 --> 36:43.424
called for another incredible stunt.

36:43.524 --> 36:46.123
(upbeat music)

36:49.683 --> 36:53.503
- From motorcycle stuntman,
to model, to actor,

36:53.603 --> 36:54.943
and I dare say it,

36:55.043 --> 36:57.323
even had a go at the
singing as well (laughs).

36:59.883 --> 37:02.303
- Throughout the eighties
and early nineties,

37:02.403 --> 37:03.983
Eddie was everywhere.

37:04.083 --> 37:05.143
He had the looks,

37:05.243 --> 37:09.063
he had the style, and me and
all my mates wanted to be him.

37:09.163 --> 37:14.163
And then in 1993, he did a
stunt that blew us all away.

37:14.843 --> 37:17.843
(suspenseful music)

37:23.483 --> 37:26.903
- I think to be a motorcycle
jumper, you have to be brave.

37:27.003 --> 37:29.143
You have to be confident.

37:29.243 --> 37:32.002
The drop off the side was hundreds of feet.

37:34.082 --> 37:35.542
- [Paddy] By Eddie's standards,

37:35.642 --> 37:39.502
the Great Wall wasn't
an especially long jump,

37:39.602 --> 37:43.562
but it was insanely dangerous.

37:44.682 --> 37:46.182
- You're setting yourself off

37:46.282 --> 37:48.022
knowing that this could be

37:48.122 --> 37:51.062
the last time you're
gonna be able to walk,

37:51.162 --> 37:52.222
and breathe, and run.

37:52.322 --> 37:55.082
(engine revving)

37:58.482 --> 38:00.482
Off he goes down the ramp.

38:03.562 --> 38:06.622
He takes off, disappears from my view.

38:06.722 --> 38:11.722
I can't see him.

38:17.122 --> 38:17.861
- Yeah?

38:17.961 --> 38:19.781
- Yeah, yeah.

38:19.881 --> 38:20.621
- You alright?

38:20.721 --> 38:22.301
- All right, yeah.

38:22.401 --> 38:23.421
(crowd cheering)

38:23.521 --> 38:27.381
- To have that straight bottle to do that,

38:27.481 --> 38:30.581
to get on the bike and kill that stunt,

38:30.681 --> 38:34.621
and nail it, is a phenomenal talent

38:34.721 --> 38:36.881
that you don't come across very often.

38:38.281 --> 38:39.181
(crowd cheering)

38:39.281 --> 38:42.601
- It was impressive to a guy like me.

38:45.081 --> 38:46.541
'Cause I never did it.

38:46.641 --> 38:48.941
But when you walk into a brand new jump

38:49.041 --> 38:50.621
and there's this much room for error,

38:50.721 --> 38:54.341
which is none, it's like be real spot on,

38:54.441 --> 38:56.221
or you're in trouble.

38:56.321 --> 38:58.321
And he did it spot-on.

39:00.641 --> 39:03.700
- For years, Eddie had
tried to lure his old rival,

39:03.800 --> 39:06.420
Evel Knievel into a jump-off,

39:06.520 --> 39:08.220
but he didn't take that bait.

39:08.320 --> 39:11.500
And by '93, he'd long since retired.

39:11.600 --> 39:16.340
But Evel's son Robbie was
now also a daredevil rider.

39:16.440 --> 39:19.240
In fact, he was even better than his dad.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.380
- I was like, this is
only worthy challenger

39:26.480 --> 39:29.740
that I've seen that looks like me,

39:29.840 --> 39:33.380
focused on that jump that
I wanna jump against.

39:33.480 --> 39:34.300
- I was like, what?

39:34.400 --> 39:36.260
You're gonna have a Knievel
versus Kidd at last?

39:36.360 --> 39:38.360
This thing is a dream come true.

39:39.560 --> 39:42.560
- They called it the Daredevil Duel.

39:43.440 --> 39:46.660
Robbie in the trademark
Knievel white suit,

39:46.760 --> 39:49.099
versus Eddie all in black.

39:49.199 --> 39:51.939
(engine revving)

39:52.039 --> 39:56.159
- What I remember is
just total competition.

39:57.039 --> 40:01.559
- [Announcer] Ladies and
gentlemen, Robbie Knievel.

40:03.159 --> 40:07.339
- I thought I was the best,
and he thought he was the best.

40:07.439 --> 40:09.919
- [Announcer] From London,
England , Eddie Kidd!

40:13.559 --> 40:16.419
- [Paddy] Each rider had three jumps.

40:16.519 --> 40:18.379
Furthest combined distance,

40:18.479 --> 40:23.479
would be crowned daredevil
champion of the world.

40:24.999 --> 40:25.899
(engine revving)

40:25.999 --> 40:28.459
- It's the craziest thing every time,

40:28.559 --> 40:30.679
because you're risking your life.

40:31.519 --> 40:34.939
(engine revving)

40:35.039 --> 40:37.038
- [Announcer] He's got it lined up.

40:39.438 --> 40:43.278
- My first jump was small, like 192 feet.

40:44.318 --> 40:48.538
- [Announcer] I believe
Eddie Kidd is ready to go.

40:48.638 --> 40:51.398
(engine revving)

40:53.558 --> 40:56.458
- Then Eddie comes out and does 214.

40:56.558 --> 40:58.018
- [Announcer] Eddie
Kidd is letting it rip,

40:58.118 --> 41:00.178
nearing 90 miles an hour.

41:00.278 --> 41:03.338
(crowd cheering)

41:03.438 --> 41:05.578
214 ft.

41:05.678 --> 41:06.418
- Yeah!

41:06.518 --> 41:08.518
- I'm like oh, man, I'm in trouble.

41:10.478 --> 41:14.738
My next jump, I just said this is
it, I'm going to risk it all.

41:14.838 --> 41:16.538
(engine revving)

41:16.638 --> 41:18.418
- I watched that thing with bated breath.

41:18.518 --> 41:20.218
Because these were world record,

41:20.318 --> 41:22.377
everyone was a world record jump.

41:22.477 --> 41:24.297
- [Announcer] That's Robbie airborne.

41:24.397 --> 41:25.697
This was a big one.

41:25.797 --> 41:27.417
Oh it's a huge jump!

41:27.517 --> 41:29.177
- I was like, yeah.

41:29.277 --> 41:32.377
- That could well be the
biggest jump of the night.

41:32.477 --> 41:37.237
- That whole jump competition
went on the last jump.

41:38.877 --> 41:39.857
Knievel had done his three jumps.

41:39.957 --> 41:41.957
Eddie was doing this last jump.

41:43.437 --> 41:48.437
- [Announcer] The biggest
jump of Eddie Kidd's career.

41:49.357 --> 41:52.417
(breathing)

41:52.517 --> 41:55.277
(engine revving)

41:58.317 --> 42:00.457
He needs 210 feet.

42:00.557 --> 42:02.857
Kidd is coming, and he's
off the launch ramp.

42:02.957 --> 42:04.297
- Eddie comes right back like that,

42:04.397 --> 42:06.397
and you think no, no, no, no, no.

42:16.916 --> 42:19.636
Bang, somehow he brings it back.

42:23.236 --> 42:26.656
- Yes!
- [Announcer] 215 feet for Eddie Kidd.

42:28.156 --> 42:29.896
- That was a massive
achievement for Eddie.

42:29.996 --> 42:33.436
The son of Evel Knievel and he beats him.

42:34.876 --> 42:37.636
- When I saw him grab that belt,

42:39.956 --> 42:41.956
I go, he deserves it.

42:46.996 --> 42:48.096
- At last he's gotten that recognition,

42:48.196 --> 42:50.716
where he surpassed the Knievel legend.

42:51.596 --> 42:55.955
- The best jumper for sure that
I ever seen in my life.

43:11.555 --> 43:14.075
- I never worried about Eddie.

43:14.915 --> 43:16.415
Why?

43:16.515 --> 43:18.515
Why did I not worry about it?

43:19.635 --> 43:23.475
Because he had so much
confidence in himself.

43:26.355 --> 43:28.855
- Eddie never had any bad accidents.

43:28.955 --> 43:31.135
Never broke a bone in his body.

43:31.235 --> 43:32.455
- He was almost...

43:32.555 --> 43:34.855
Teflon Eddie, he just bounced back.

43:34.955 --> 43:36.955
He was indestructible.

43:40.114 --> 43:42.214
- Three years after the Daredevil Duel,

43:42.314 --> 43:44.734
Eddie was back in Britain performing here,

43:44.834 --> 43:48.214
at a motorcycle festival
called The Bulldog Bash.

43:48.314 --> 43:49.774
Now the jump was pretty standard

43:49.874 --> 43:51.414
for someone as skilled as Eddie.

43:51.514 --> 43:53.374
50 odd feet over the drag strip.

43:53.474 --> 43:55.214
But the landing,

43:55.314 --> 43:58.094
that was going to be a
little bit more tricky.

43:58.194 --> 44:00.934
- He got there and I said,

44:01.034 --> 44:02.734
you're jumping into a hill,

44:02.834 --> 44:04.214
and there's no way you can do that.

44:04.314 --> 44:06.534
All my ears of experience
following Motocross

44:06.634 --> 44:10.174
and being involved in it,
you will injure yourself.

44:10.274 --> 44:12.014
- When you have a landing ramp,

44:12.114 --> 44:12.894
you come down,

44:12.994 --> 44:16.174
the landing ramp brings you
down nice and slowly to gravity.

44:16.274 --> 44:19.074
You know, it's a smooth transition down.

44:19.994 --> 44:21.134
You cannot land uphill.

44:21.234 --> 44:24.853
- I did really try and talk him out of it,

44:24.953 --> 44:27.833
but he said he'd committed
himself and he was gonna do it.

44:28.753 --> 44:31.513
(engine revving)

44:33.433 --> 44:34.693
- He lands and he's
straight into an uphill,

44:34.793 --> 44:37.173
so bike does that, literally, bang,

44:37.273 --> 44:39.273
and his head hit the petrol tank.

44:42.113 --> 44:43.573
- His body went limp.

44:43.673 --> 44:45.213
Straight away you could see,

44:45.313 --> 44:46.813
that he was knocked unconscious,

44:46.913 --> 44:49.613
didn't make any attempt
to put any breaks on.

44:49.713 --> 44:51.213
- You think he's got control of the bike

44:51.313 --> 44:53.013
even though he's unconscious,

44:53.113 --> 44:55.293
'cause he seems to slow
as he goes to the top.

44:55.393 --> 44:57.813
And you're thinking, he's got
it, he's got it, he's got it.

44:57.913 --> 44:59.253
And then almost in slow
motion, if you watch it back,

44:59.353 --> 45:01.553
almost in slow motion,
he drops of the edge.

45:04.353 --> 45:07.233
And that's when I knew, it
wasn't a simple accident.

45:10.713 --> 45:12.572
- When I managed to get around there,

45:12.672 --> 45:14.252
he was at the bottom of this bank

45:14.352 --> 45:17.332
laid there with two Hell's
Angels close to him,

45:17.432 --> 45:19.432
and they were calling the ambulance.

45:22.792 --> 45:24.792
I thought he was dead.

45:29.072 --> 45:33.432
- We got a phone call saying
that Eddie was in the hospital.

45:36.112 --> 45:39.392
When we got there, he was in a coma.

45:40.352 --> 45:42.512
They told us that he was in a coma.

45:44.832 --> 45:48.712
I couldn't believe it, that
he'd had this accident.

45:52.632 --> 45:55.392
- I remember going in
and the doctor saying,

45:58.151 --> 46:00.411
the next 72 hours or whatever it was,

46:00.511 --> 46:02.511
dunno know what it was.

46:02.991 --> 46:04.931
Well, I thought, and then I walked out.

46:05.031 --> 46:07.031
In fact it's making me emotional now.

46:11.431 --> 46:14.071
Because I thought they were
telling me he was gonna die.

46:17.111 --> 46:20.471
- Eddie survived, but it
was a close-run thing.

46:21.391 --> 46:23.811
He spent three months in a coma.

46:23.911 --> 46:25.731
And when he finally awoke,

46:25.831 --> 46:28.731
he was left with
life-changing brain injuries.

46:28.831 --> 46:33.731
That was 25 years ago
but here's the thing.

46:33.831 --> 46:35.651
When I set out to make this film,

46:35.751 --> 46:39.011
I didn't just wanna tell you
the story of my childhood hero,

46:39.111 --> 46:41.171
I wanted to meet him.

46:41.271 --> 46:44.410
To pay my respects to
a great British legend,

46:44.510 --> 46:47.350
and show him just what a trail he blazed.

46:50.590 --> 46:53.350
(birds chirping)

46:54.230 --> 46:56.950
- Eddie now lives on the south coast.

46:57.830 --> 47:00.170
He has a carer, Glenn.

47:00.270 --> 47:01.030
- [Paddy] Hello, pal, how are you?

47:01.110 --> 47:01.850
- [Glen] Hey, Pally how are ya?

47:01.950 --> 47:02.690
- [Paddy] Good to see you.

47:02.790 --> 47:04.050
- [Glen] Glad to see ya.

47:04.150 --> 47:08.090
- And they were good enough
to let me stop by for a chat.

47:08.190 --> 47:11.790
The governor, the absolute governor.

47:13.070 --> 47:16.490
Eddie, pleased to meet you, sir.

47:16.590 --> 47:18.130
Pleased to meet you.

47:18.230 --> 47:20.490
- I know he said "Paddy".

47:20.590 --> 47:25.590
- (laughs) Eddie I cannot
believe I'm here with you.

47:29.309 --> 47:32.449
My mates will be so jealous.

47:32.549 --> 47:35.569
Honestly, when I was a
kid, I had your posters

47:35.669 --> 47:36.849
up in my bedroom,

47:36.949 --> 47:39.329
until my mum took them
for her own bedroom.

47:39.429 --> 47:41.649
But I don't wanna talk
about that on camera.

47:41.749 --> 47:43.849
But it's an absolute thrill.

47:43.949 --> 47:46.889
I'm so glad you've let me
come and see you down here.

47:46.989 --> 47:49.969
Would you mind if I just get
rid of my nervous energy,

47:50.069 --> 47:51.089
and just have a little bit of a look

47:51.189 --> 47:52.769
at some of your items around?

47:52.869 --> 47:53.969
- Go, go, go.

47:54.069 --> 47:54.769
- Go, go, go.

47:54.869 --> 47:56.729
- Right, I'm on it, I'm on it.

47:56.829 --> 47:58.929
I've gotta come over here first.

47:59.029 --> 48:02.329
Oh, wow, these the Vivienne Westwood ones?

48:02.429 --> 48:03.529
- [Glen] Some weight on them.

48:03.629 --> 48:06.089
- Look at the weight!

48:06.189 --> 48:07.169
Am I okay-

48:07.269 --> 48:09.249
I was gonna say, am I okay
to touch your helmet, Eddie?

48:09.349 --> 48:11.349
So that's-

48:13.109 --> 48:15.528
- Look on the back.

48:15.628 --> 48:16.608
- The back?

48:16.708 --> 48:18.708
It ain't easy being this good (laughs).

48:22.548 --> 48:24.548
- Can you spell it?
- Fear no Evel.

48:25.828 --> 48:27.828
Look at that.

48:29.828 --> 48:32.568
So this is the actual bike then?

48:32.668 --> 48:35.128
- [Glen] Look at the tank, Paddy.

48:35.228 --> 48:36.728
That's from the crash.

48:36.828 --> 48:38.808
- Oh, this here.

48:38.908 --> 48:42.328
I mean, this is for me a real surprise

48:42.428 --> 48:44.688
at seeing the damage caused.

48:44.788 --> 48:46.788
Because it's just as quick as that.

48:48.068 --> 48:50.788
- So this bike you nicknamed Sid.

48:51.948 --> 48:54.248
Because they say it was so vicious.

48:54.348 --> 48:56.348
- Yeah.

48:56.708 --> 48:59.428
- That is mad.

49:01.067 --> 49:05.227
So this is the Great
Wall of China jump, oh.

49:10.107 --> 49:14.267
- It was the hardest jump he's done.

49:16.067 --> 49:20.527
And the mayor, he was down
the bottom speaking to people.

49:20.627 --> 49:21.327
He missed it.

49:21.427 --> 49:23.287
He asked Eddie to do it again (laughs).

49:23.387 --> 49:25.287
- No way.

49:25.387 --> 49:26.447
- I don't think-

49:26.547 --> 49:30.207
- I don't think so.

49:30.307 --> 49:32.007
(all laughing)

49:32.107 --> 49:35.607
- So, I noticed Sid out
in the hall there, Eddie.

49:35.707 --> 49:37.527
Who else drove that bike apart from you?

49:37.627 --> 49:38.647
Was anyone-

49:38.747 --> 49:39.647
(Eddie gasps)

49:39.747 --> 49:41.007
- [Glen] What's he done, what's he done?

49:41.107 --> 49:41.847
- What have I done?

49:41.947 --> 49:42.647
What?

49:42.747 --> 49:44.127
Ride, ride!

49:44.227 --> 49:46.646
Oh no, no!

49:46.746 --> 49:47.486
- [Glen] He drove a bike!

49:47.586 --> 49:48.846
- No, how have I done it?

49:48.946 --> 49:50.886
How have I done that
in front of the gaffer?

49:50.986 --> 49:52.086
- That is the worst thing

49:52.186 --> 49:55.266
you can ever say, ever (laughs).

49:56.426 --> 49:59.046
- I've upset myself. I've
upset my family name.

49:59.146 --> 50:02.206
I won't be allowed back up
in Bolton after this, Eddie.

50:02.306 --> 50:03.646
Oh, god, you want to be doing-

50:03.746 --> 50:04.966
(laughing)

50:06.766 --> 50:09.326
Pack it in, Eddie!

50:12.026 --> 50:14.586
(upbeat music)

50:17.146 --> 50:19.886
Now, it's probably just as well for me,

50:19.986 --> 50:22.466
the story doesn't end there.

50:23.546 --> 50:27.386
Because it was time to show
Eddie that trail he blazed.

50:30.426 --> 50:33.745
And that meant taking a little drive.

50:34.625 --> 50:37.045
The Black Knights ride again!

50:37.145 --> 50:39.225
(laughs)

50:40.825 --> 50:43.105
What a way to travel, lads.

50:46.265 --> 50:49.445
Check this boys out now, Eddie.

50:49.545 --> 50:52.265
(engine revving)

51:01.465 --> 51:03.465
Go on boys!

51:05.505 --> 51:08.105
Yeah, all for you, Eddie!

51:16.425 --> 51:21.424
Yes, wow.

51:22.544 --> 51:25.304
(engine revving)

51:39.824 --> 51:44.824
That little trike at the back.

51:47.224 --> 51:49.224
Wow, wow.

51:51.104 --> 51:54.104
(melancholic music)

52:15.023 --> 52:18.623
I've got a little surprise
for you up here, Eddie.

52:20.423 --> 52:25.583
(crowd cheering)

52:35.223 --> 52:36.843
Eddie, while you get yourself acquainted

52:36.943 --> 52:38.283
with your friends and family,

52:38.383 --> 52:40.363
I'm gonna get out 'cause I've
got a bit of something special

52:40.463 --> 52:42.463
lined up for you, pal.

52:43.183 --> 52:45.183
Here we go.

52:48.463 --> 52:51.022
(upbeat music)

52:54.942 --> 52:57.042
You all right, Eddie?

52:57.142 --> 53:00.042
Paddy Kidd at your service.

53:00.142 --> 53:03.242
And this is a bit of something
I've done just for you, pal.

53:03.342 --> 53:04.562
(crowd cheering)

53:04.662 --> 53:07.422
(engine revving)

53:19.222 --> 53:25.982
(crowd cheering)
- Come on, Paddy!

53:29.942 --> 53:31.642
Just for you, that, pal.

53:31.742 --> 53:33.482
(all laughing)

53:33.582 --> 53:36.022
Oh, what are you laughing at?

53:37.101 --> 53:39.921
It took me a month to practice that.

53:40.021 --> 53:40.961
(all laughing)

53:41.061 --> 53:42.281
Let me get this off, here.

53:42.381 --> 53:46.681
- Where is the fire?

53:46.781 --> 53:49.681
(all laughing)

53:49.781 --> 53:54.561
- Well, listen, that
was just the appetiser.

53:54.661 --> 53:56.561
Now it's time for the main course.

53:56.661 --> 53:58.661
Hit it!

53:59.061 --> 54:01.621
(upbeat music)

54:04.061 --> 54:09.061
Yes, for Britain's best, we
brought together the best.

54:10.381 --> 54:11.481
- This is for you, Eddie.

54:11.581 --> 54:13.521
- Some of this great nation's

54:13.621 --> 54:16.441
most talented performers on wheels.

54:16.541 --> 54:18.001
- This is for you, Eddie.

54:18.101 --> 54:21.281
- Everyone dedicating their lives

54:21.381 --> 54:26.380
to pure daredevil showmanship.

54:27.100 --> 54:28.800
- This is for you.

54:28.900 --> 54:30.520
(engine revving)

54:30.620 --> 54:35.620
- Oh, oh, here we go!

54:37.420 --> 54:40.180
(crowd cheering)

55:31.539 --> 55:33.539
Here he is.

55:38.019 --> 55:40.279
Oh (laughs).

55:40.379 --> 55:43.139
(engine revving)

55:48.699 --> 55:50.779
(cheers)

56:12.298 --> 56:15.778
Oh, bloody hell, I were
convinced he were off then!

56:21.858 --> 56:27.178
Oh, yeah!
Oh, here we go!

57:00.417 --> 57:02.417
- Eddie was the pioneer.

57:02.977 --> 57:05.837
He paved the way and
inspired a generation of kids

57:05.937 --> 57:07.937
that are doing it now.

57:11.097 --> 57:12.917
- He was the king of jumps.

57:13.017 --> 57:14.357
He would push it to the extreme,

57:14.457 --> 57:16.937
every time he would get on his motorcycle.

57:20.937 --> 57:23.437
- The fact that he started
doing this when he was just 14,

57:23.537 --> 57:25.717
and jumping over buses in just a helmet,

57:25.817 --> 57:28.316
and a leather jacket, is insane.

57:28.416 --> 57:30.916
It takes that one person to do it

57:31.016 --> 57:33.856
and then everyone else thinks,
oh yeah, we could do that.

57:34.736 --> 57:37.876
- Everything that he did was
gnarly and without Eddie,

57:37.976 --> 57:40.216
I, you know, God knows where we'd be.

57:41.776 --> 57:44.956
- You pioneered for all of
us to have a fantastic career

57:45.056 --> 57:46.676
in this industry.

57:46.776 --> 57:49.796
Thanks, Eddie.

57:49.896 --> 57:51.896
Keep smiling, buddy.

58:00.136 --> 58:02.856
(crowd cheering)

58:25.695 --> 58:29.015
- Don't make him cry, he'll make me cry.

58:32.695 --> 58:34.875
- Bloody hell, we're all at it.

58:34.975 --> 58:37.115
(all laughing)

58:37.215 --> 58:39.215
I think it were the petrol fumes.

58:41.775 --> 58:44.935
(audience applauding)

58:47.175 --> 58:49.635
- That was a special film.

58:49.735 --> 58:50.435
- For sure.

58:50.535 --> 58:52.195
- What are hero he is.

58:52.295 --> 58:53.275
And what a privilege to meet,

58:53.375 --> 58:56.435
the man is an absolute legend.

58:56.535 --> 58:57.715
- Yep.
- Fair play, Paddy,

58:57.815 --> 58:59.194
that was different class.

58:59.294 --> 59:02.434
Proper tribute to a proper British hero.

59:02.534 --> 59:03.594
Well played.
- Correct, correct.

59:03.694 --> 59:04.994
- One of the all-time greats.

59:05.094 --> 59:06.354
Look how many people wanted to come out

59:06.454 --> 59:08.234
and say thank you to Eddie.

59:08.334 --> 59:10.514
He was an inspiration to so many people.

59:10.614 --> 59:12.834
- He definitely was and
God bless you, Eddie.

59:12.934 --> 59:13.754
That's it for tonight.

59:13.854 --> 59:16.554
We'll be back next week, when
we fast forward to the future

59:16.654 --> 59:19.794
with some brand new,
state-of-the-art electric cars.

59:19.894 --> 59:21.234
- And some tiny caravans.

59:21.334 --> 59:24.354
- Very tiny, very small.
perfect for you, Chris.

59:24.454 --> 59:25.394
- Harsh.

59:25.494 --> 59:28.334
- Thanks so much for watching, goodnight.
