thank you.

03:22.634 --> 03:25.500
actually, i don't know
why i stepped back there.
there's no danger.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.433
no danger?
exactly.

03:27.433 --> 03:30.101
i don't know why
i'm saying any of this.

03:30.101 --> 03:33.201
i'm flippin' out here.
craziness!

03:34.734 --> 03:36.533
so, what are you doing?

03:36.533 --> 03:39.301
oh, you know, the same.
shopping.

03:41.067 --> 03:44.400
god, you must be thinking
what's oliver gonna be doing

03:44.400 --> 03:46.433
with all this toilet roll?

03:46.433 --> 03:49.034
actually, i leave that
to your imagination.

03:49.034 --> 03:51.934
actually, please don't
start imagining that.
that would be disgusting.

03:51.934 --> 03:54.067
yeah.
it was on offer, that's all.

03:54.067 --> 03:58.201
i'm not some kind of
a crazed toilet roll...

03:58.201 --> 04:00.334
supporter.

04:02.268 --> 04:05.301
i mean, it's toilet roll.
if it's there, i'll use it.

04:05.301 --> 04:08.901
and it generally is there
when i need it,

04:08.901 --> 04:11.201
which is great.

04:12.301 --> 04:13.634
yes.

04:13.634 --> 04:17.067
anyway, i best be going.
things to do.
okay.

04:17.067 --> 04:20.067
gotta go home and get
these babies installed.

04:20.067 --> 04:21.700
yeah.

04:21.700 --> 04:24.700
i just called them babies,
didn't i?

04:24.700 --> 04:26.901
you did.
ha ha! babies!

04:26.901 --> 04:28.700
i don't know
what that's about!

04:28.700 --> 04:30.834
you don't install babies!

04:30.834 --> 04:33.901
no. listen, um...

04:35.667 --> 04:37.500
i've really got to--

04:37.500 --> 04:39.301
yeah. yeah, of course.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.201
woman:
hello, oliver.

04:46.201 --> 04:48.167
hello, mrs. m.
you're looking
ravishing today.

04:48.167 --> 04:50.567
do you like my new hair?

04:50.567 --> 04:53.400
hard to say, mrs. m.
where is it this time?

04:53.400 --> 04:55.600
ha ha ha ha ha!

04:55.600 --> 04:58.533
hello, oliver.
mrs. c.

04:58.533 --> 05:00.433
are you admiring
sheila's hair?

05:00.433 --> 05:03.001
not yet,
but i'm hoping.

05:03.001 --> 05:04.700
ha ha ha!
ha ha ha!

05:05.800 --> 05:08.500
i'll catch you later,
mrs. m.

05:11.234 --> 05:15.101
listen, um, sorry about
all that baby stuff.

05:15.101 --> 05:17.867
i don't know what
i was thinking.
that's okay.

05:17.867 --> 05:19.500
look, um...

05:19.500 --> 05:21.433
would you like
to get a coffee?

05:21.433 --> 05:23.301
yeah.

05:23.301 --> 05:26.001
yeah, that's exactly
what i'd like.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.500
( phone rings )

05:33.034 --> 05:34.101
hello?

05:34.101 --> 05:35.634
hi.

05:35.634 --> 05:39.901
<i>sorry, you meant a coffee
together, didn't you?</i>

05:42.167 --> 05:44.400
pretty much, yeah.

05:50.467 --> 05:52.767
well, you got here
really quickly.

05:54.201 --> 05:56.667
i'm just round the corner.
it's very close.

05:56.667 --> 05:57.934
right.

06:00.567 --> 06:04.301
so, did you install
your toilet rolls?

06:04.301 --> 06:07.467
yeah. yeah, i did.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.600
good.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.800
so, did you install your--

06:12.167 --> 06:15.500
<i>( giggles )
oh, god.</i>

06:16.667 --> 06:19.301
what is the matter
with me?!

06:19.301 --> 06:20.634
i don't know.

06:20.634 --> 06:22.834
why can't i talk?
what's happened to my brain?

06:22.834 --> 06:26.234
never mind about your brain.
brains are overrated.

06:26.234 --> 06:29.700
many plants don't have brains.
have you thought about that?

06:29.700 --> 06:32.800
<i>why can't i talk normally?</i>

06:32.800 --> 06:35.634
i'm fairly sure i used to
have the power of speech.

06:35.634 --> 06:37.734
well, you talked to
the ladies in the supermarket.

06:37.734 --> 06:40.167
that's easy.
i don't want to
sleep with them.

06:41.867 --> 06:44.301
okay, i'm just gonna
put my head down on the table.

06:44.301 --> 06:46.301
you can slip away
in your own time.

06:46.301 --> 06:49.500
you can't talk to people if
you want to have sex with them?

06:49.500 --> 06:52.500
please, leave me here to die.
save yourself.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.700
isn't that
a bit of a problem?

06:54.700 --> 06:56.268
do you really think
it might be?

06:56.268 --> 06:58.067
i wasn't sure,
so thanks for
clearing that up.

06:58.067 --> 07:01.368
i could still talk to you
even if i wanted to have sex
with you.

07:04.634 --> 07:07.134
ever get the feeling
you're spinning away

07:07.134 --> 07:10.134
into a great black void
of failure and loneliness

07:10.134 --> 07:12.268
with one last
despairing scream?

07:12.268 --> 07:14.734
everybody feels like that.
that's normal.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.934
you just get up
and have breakfast.

07:21.034 --> 07:23.234
"many" plants?
what?

07:23.234 --> 07:25.867
many plants
don't have brains?

07:25.867 --> 07:26.867
exactly.

07:26.867 --> 07:29.301
jane, no plants
have brains.

07:29.301 --> 07:32.700
yet they have
their own wisdom.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.600
what wisdom?

07:34.600 --> 07:38.567
the wisdom of plants.
what wisdom is that?

07:38.567 --> 07:41.600
it's very deep, oliver.
it's very spiritual.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.934
it's so typically...
planty.

07:45.934 --> 07:48.034
you're making this up.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.234
no, i'm not.
it's a philosophy.

07:50.234 --> 07:51.967
i follow
a lot of philosophies.

07:51.967 --> 07:54.268
it's one of the things
people really notice about me.

07:54.268 --> 07:57.667
so, you follow
the philosophy of plants.

07:57.667 --> 08:00.101
i am a committed
vegetarian, yes.

08:00.101 --> 08:01.901
really.

08:01.901 --> 08:03.901
it's a life choice.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.334
so let me
get this straight.

08:05.334 --> 08:07.867
you believe in the wisdom
and the philosophy of plants.

08:07.867 --> 08:10.368
yes, i do, oliver.
i absolutely do.

08:10.368 --> 08:13.368
so you eat them.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.368
hmm.

08:15.368 --> 08:18.667
<i>let me get this straight.
you're a heterosexual man...</i>

08:18.667 --> 08:20.034
yeah.

08:20.034 --> 08:23.201
...but you can't
talk to women.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.234
okay.

08:26.234 --> 08:29.167
we kinda got
one in each there,
didn't we?

08:29.167 --> 08:31.301
so why do the shop ladies
know you?

08:31.301 --> 08:33.833
well, i've been
shopping there
for five years.

08:33.833 --> 08:35.268
oh.

08:35.268 --> 08:36.533
what?

08:36.533 --> 08:39.301
i've been shopping there
for seven.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.634
right.

08:40.634 --> 08:43.700
it's funny
they noticed you
and not me.

08:43.700 --> 08:44.834
yeah.

08:44.834 --> 08:46.433
why?

08:46.433 --> 08:49.134
i'm very much
a noticeable person.

08:49.134 --> 08:50.433
oh, okay.

08:50.433 --> 08:52.967
crazy, wacky jane?

08:52.967 --> 08:56.001
everyone's got
their own story about me.

08:56.001 --> 08:57.167
yeah?

08:57.167 --> 08:59.234
i try to make sure.

08:59.234 --> 09:02.067
it's just a bunch of old ladies
with alarming moles.

09:02.067 --> 09:04.433
i wouldn't worry about it.
i'm not worried about it.

09:04.433 --> 09:07.734
i just feel
they're not keeping up.

09:07.734 --> 09:10.767
mrs. m. has got
the biggest mole in england.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.334
it should be carried on
to the next old lady.

09:13.334 --> 09:16.101
you find yourself giving it
equal eye contact time,

09:16.101 --> 09:18.167
otherwise you feel rude.

09:18.167 --> 09:19.700
shit!
what?

09:19.700 --> 09:22.700
her name's barker.
barker?

09:22.700 --> 09:24.834
mrs. m.
she should be mrs. b.

09:24.834 --> 09:27.334
i'm calling her mrs. m.
after the mole!

09:27.334 --> 09:29.433
oh, god! really?

09:29.433 --> 09:33.234
how long have i
been doing that?
that's borderline rude!

09:33.234 --> 09:34.967
but it's really funny.

09:34.967 --> 09:36.800
every time i'm in there
i'm going

09:36.800 --> 09:38.533
"don't think
about the mole."

09:38.533 --> 09:40.600
i only went
and named her after it.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.901
ha ha ha ha!
( snorts )

09:41.901 --> 09:44.700
i'll tell you something,
though.
what?

09:44.700 --> 09:48.433
if mrs. p is the one
with the bladder complaint,
i'm switching to tesco's.

09:51.334 --> 09:53.301
anyway, this is me.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.834
your flat?

09:54.834 --> 09:56.034
yeah.

09:56.034 --> 09:59.533
listen, it's been really--
can i come up?

09:59.533 --> 10:02.334
( all choking
on drinks )

10:02.334 --> 10:04.167
<i>you just said that?</i>

10:04.167 --> 10:05.234
yep.

10:05.234 --> 10:08.301
did he look surprised?
he look terrified.

10:08.301 --> 10:10.567
there are rules.
there's a procedure.

10:10.567 --> 10:13.567
we don't just say,
"can i come up to your flat?"

10:13.567 --> 10:15.734
we hint at the possibility

10:15.734 --> 10:18.001
that at some point
in the distant future

10:18.001 --> 10:21.834
we might linger momentarily
in the right post code.

10:21.834 --> 10:25.433
a woman with her clothes on
has negotiating power.

10:25.433 --> 10:29.234
we have what they want,
and we've got to sit on it.

10:31.101 --> 10:34.234
sorry, that was
a bit more graphic
than i was aiming for.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.634
i just wanted
to see his flat.

10:36.634 --> 10:39.368
i don't think
he interpreted it
as an offer of sex.

10:39.368 --> 10:43.334
jane, things men
are capable of interpreting
as an offer of sex:

10:43.334 --> 10:46.767
"hello."
"oh, look. it's raining."

10:46.767 --> 10:49.667
"my boyfriend's just been
kidnapped by drug smugglers."

10:49.667 --> 10:51.301
"get out."

10:52.567 --> 10:55.600
what, she just--just--
yeah.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.700
so you had sex
with her?

10:58.700 --> 11:01.201
n-no. she-she came up
to my flat.

11:01.201 --> 11:03.167
so you had sex with her.

11:03.167 --> 11:05.667
no, she came up
to my flat.

11:05.667 --> 11:08.467
patrick really
can't hear the difference

11:08.467 --> 11:10.634
between those sentences.

11:10.634 --> 11:12.167
the thing is, though,

11:12.167 --> 11:14.734
it's been ages
since tamsin left.
so?

11:14.734 --> 11:16.134
my flat.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.901
what about it?

11:17.901 --> 11:19.268
well, think about it.

11:19.268 --> 11:22.334
all that time
i'm living alone
in my flat.

11:22.334 --> 11:25.067
it's a bit...
what?

11:25.067 --> 11:27.334
unedited.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.800
um...

11:31.800 --> 11:33.234
he just um'ed?

11:33.234 --> 11:36.034
it's getting so a person
can't be a slut anymore.

11:36.034 --> 11:39.234
i just wanted
to see his flat.

11:39.234 --> 11:41.700
oh, come on.
even you don't believe that.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.834
well...

11:43.834 --> 11:47.268
<i>there was maybe
a kind of chemistry
happening.</i>

11:47.268 --> 11:50.634
we've seen you in
a state of chemistry.

11:50.634 --> 11:52.867
all across town
dogs start howling.

11:52.867 --> 11:55.400
there's a new scent
on the wind,

11:55.400 --> 11:58.034
and the pets of london
are locked indoors.

11:58.034 --> 12:01.101
you can't always
blame that on me!

12:02.467 --> 12:05.167
okay, she's gone.
she's left you.

12:05.167 --> 12:08.467
stage one:
you buy a bigger television.

12:10.034 --> 12:11.834
okay.
makes sense.

12:11.834 --> 12:15.734
stage two:
you point your chair
directly at the television,

12:15.734 --> 12:17.634
and no one is gonna
come to your flat ever again

12:17.634 --> 12:20.700
and you're alone
in the universe.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.634
stage three:

12:22.634 --> 12:24.134
this is the bad one.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.234
this is the very bad one.

12:26.234 --> 12:29.067
this is when you know
you've given up on
human contact.

12:32.167 --> 12:34.767
<i>this is when you know
you're not expecting anyone</i>

12:34.767 --> 12:37.067
<i>to call round
ever again.</i>

12:39.400 --> 12:40.634
right.

12:41.901 --> 12:43.901
here it is.
great.

12:43.901 --> 12:45.533
my flat.

12:46.734 --> 12:48.700
this is the door to it.

12:48.700 --> 12:51.567
pretty much a standard door.

12:52.767 --> 12:55.334
hinges...

12:55.334 --> 12:56.500
yeah.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.201
god, hinges.

12:58.201 --> 13:00.901
oliver?
yes, of course. door.

13:02.201 --> 13:05.067
let's get this door
on the road.

13:06.234 --> 13:08.433
one day,

13:08.433 --> 13:11.834
one dark, lonely afternoon...

13:11.834 --> 13:15.734
you realize you've
stopped hiding your porn.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.433
it's just lying around
everywhere!

13:25.433 --> 13:28.767
my living room has lost
the battle with nudity.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.101
you spend an evening
stoned on my sofa,

13:31.101 --> 13:35.467
you think a girl's changing room
is leaking through from
another dimension.

13:44.334 --> 13:48.567
<i>you should not,
in those circumstances,
phone the emergency services.</i>

13:50.101 --> 13:54.101
behind the door...
they're everywhere!

13:54.101 --> 13:56.734
they're coming!
over there!

14:00.533 --> 14:02.634
right, here we are.

14:04.101 --> 14:06.167
my flat.

14:06.167 --> 14:11.400
so there i am,
beautiful woman
actually inside my flat.

14:11.400 --> 14:15.600
on the downside, fully dressed.
on the upside, not a photograph.

14:19.034 --> 14:21.600
all i can think of is,
i need time.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.268
if she just went to the loo,
i could clear stuff away.

14:24.268 --> 14:28.301
i just needed somehow to suggest
in some subtle way

14:28.301 --> 14:30.767
she needed to visit the loo.

14:34.634 --> 14:37.500
would you like
to have a pee?

14:37.500 --> 14:38.800
yes, lovely. thanks.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.101
lemon, if you got it.

14:42.101 --> 14:43.800
lemon?

14:45.234 --> 14:48.567
i'm sorry. i thought
you just offered me
a cup of tea.

14:48.567 --> 14:51.834
<i>ha ha ha ha!
no, no! pee!</i>

14:54.667 --> 14:57.001
oh, god, sorry!
no! no!

14:57.001 --> 14:59.600
i'm not offering you
a drink of--

15:01.334 --> 15:03.734
quite the reverse.

15:05.234 --> 15:06.767
oh.

15:06.767 --> 15:08.567
oh, i see.

15:08.567 --> 15:12.734
i just meant if you'd like to
avail yourself toiletwards.

15:12.734 --> 15:13.934
no, thanks.

15:15.368 --> 15:17.368
are you sure?

15:17.368 --> 15:19.800
well...yeah.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.567
it's no trouble.

15:21.567 --> 15:23.201
i'm fine, really.

15:23.201 --> 15:26.201
right. cool.

15:26.201 --> 15:28.667
well, it's there
if you want it.

15:28.667 --> 15:29.867
yes.

15:29.867 --> 15:32.067
<i>waiting.
okay.</i>

15:32.067 --> 15:34.268
"feed me."

15:35.567 --> 15:38.368
sorry. that was
a horrible image.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.734
you know,

15:40.734 --> 15:43.934
i really wouldn't
mind that cup of tea.

15:43.934 --> 15:46.734
yes! yes, of course!

15:49.500 --> 15:52.734
could you help yourself?
i've got to check something.

15:52.734 --> 15:53.734
sure.

15:53.734 --> 15:55.234
that's the kettle.

15:55.234 --> 15:56.700
i think i can manage.

15:56.700 --> 15:58.834
as long as you don't
set anything on fire.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.034
i'm sort of on the black list.

16:03.134 --> 16:04.667
aaah!

16:10.567 --> 16:12.201
aaah!

16:14.301 --> 16:17.034
couldn't find
the tea bags.

16:17.034 --> 16:18.767
ah--

16:18.767 --> 16:21.667
are you tidying away
your magazines?

16:21.667 --> 16:23.500
pretty much.

16:23.500 --> 16:27.134
right, can i just ask,
for my own information,

16:27.134 --> 16:29.433
content of magazine-wise,

16:29.433 --> 16:32.600
how much is, um..showing?

16:33.867 --> 16:36.001
well...

16:36.001 --> 16:38.901
there seems to be a woman
called nicole...

16:38.901 --> 16:40.433
okay...

16:40.433 --> 16:44.533
...who i don't think
is really brazilian.

16:44.533 --> 16:46.301
okay.

16:46.301 --> 16:48.201
fine.

16:48.201 --> 16:50.067
good.

16:50.067 --> 16:53.234
<i>this is just
so bloody typical</i>

16:53.234 --> 16:56.467
of this whole damned room!
room?

16:56.467 --> 16:59.901
what i've been trying to do--
i expect you've been wondering--

16:59.901 --> 17:02.467
is make some vague attempt

17:02.467 --> 17:04.599
not to seem like
a complete pervert.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.532
so i'm wondering,
given the contents
of this room,

17:07.532 --> 17:09.867
is there any chance
of me not seeming like

17:09.867 --> 17:12.733
the saddest, loneliest
serial masturbator

17:12.733 --> 17:15.334
in the history
of the planet?

17:20.233 --> 17:21.733
( giggling )

17:25.567 --> 17:27.834
what is that woman doing?

17:27.834 --> 17:29.901
she's in a hay loft.

17:29.901 --> 17:31.734
she's naked.

17:31.734 --> 17:33.867
she's naked
in a hay loft.

17:33.867 --> 17:37.368
i don't understand.
what do you enjoy about this?

17:37.368 --> 17:41.301
not so much
the hay loft.
more the naked.

17:41.301 --> 17:42.967
but what's the story?

17:42.967 --> 17:45.533
well, there isn't really
a story, as such.

17:45.533 --> 17:48.700
i mean, one minute
she's up here,

17:48.700 --> 17:51.767
sitting all...like that--

17:51.767 --> 17:54.400
well, there really isn't
a plot to work out here.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.634
and the next,
she's over here
bending over.

17:57.634 --> 18:00.301
what's going on?
it's just general bending.

18:00.301 --> 18:02.867
doesn't she know
where the camera is?

18:02.867 --> 18:05.533
i suspect that she does,
in fact.

18:06.734 --> 18:08.467
my god!

18:08.467 --> 18:10.134
oh, please!

18:10.134 --> 18:12.334
look at that!
yes, i know.

18:12.334 --> 18:16.201
i mean, that's just
a big picture of--of--

18:16.201 --> 18:18.234
brazil, yes.

18:18.234 --> 18:21.400
where is the rest
of this woman?!

18:21.400 --> 18:23.400
it could be anywhere.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.334
a hay loft,
a swimming pool,

18:26.334 --> 18:28.867
a strangely 70s bedroom--
there's quite a range.

18:28.867 --> 18:31.767
this is what you enjoy?
this?!

18:31.767 --> 18:33.533
of course
it's what i enjoy!

18:33.533 --> 18:34.800
i mean, look at it!

18:34.800 --> 18:38.567
it's like being...born!

18:39.700 --> 18:42.500
you must have loved that.

18:43.667 --> 18:46.101
okay, are we finished now?

18:46.101 --> 18:49.034
or would you
like to search my flat
for embarrassing laundry?

18:49.034 --> 18:52.034
don't get me wrong, oliver,
i'm a very sexual person.

18:52.034 --> 18:54.667
in fact,
i'm a very bisexual person,

18:54.667 --> 18:56.268
so i sort of
double up on that.

18:56.268 --> 18:59.301
yeah, yeah.
you're just frightened
of naked people.

18:59.301 --> 19:01.934
<i>there's naked,
and there's naked.</i>

19:01.934 --> 19:03.901
and you're not bisexual.

19:03.901 --> 19:05.867
i'm sorry?

19:05.867 --> 19:07.368
i don't buy it.

19:07.368 --> 19:09.567
<i>you don't what?</i>

19:09.567 --> 19:12.500
and i don't buy
the crazy, wacky jane thing.

19:12.500 --> 19:16.001
and i don't buy
the you-follow-the-
philosophy-of-plants thing.

19:16.001 --> 19:18.533
i think you're terrified
you're not interesting enough

19:18.533 --> 19:20.001
so you make up
any old rubbish

19:20.001 --> 19:21.368
just to try
and get attention.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.767
do me a favor,
look in the mirror.

19:23.767 --> 19:27.433
<i>the way you look--
as if you have to try.</i>

19:28.700 --> 19:31.734
<i>i am so bisexual!</i>

19:31.734 --> 19:33.634
yeah?

19:35.834 --> 19:37.301
okay!

19:39.201 --> 19:41.634
jane, i'm a science fiction fan.

19:41.634 --> 19:44.167
i run a science fiction
bookshop.

19:44.167 --> 19:45.934
it's the headquarters
of lonely.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.634
i am the boss of sad.

19:47.634 --> 19:50.934
you can fool everyone else,
but you can't fool me.

19:50.934 --> 19:54.500
there's naked,
and there's naked.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.167
how's this for naked?

19:57.167 --> 19:59.067
well...

19:59.067 --> 20:00.600
well?

20:07.433 --> 20:09.634
actually, i prefer videos.

20:09.634 --> 20:11.268
what?

20:11.268 --> 20:14.301
i prefer porn in video form.
it's more realistic.

20:14.301 --> 20:16.533
do you have any of those?

20:16.533 --> 20:18.433
you'd never
be able to handle it.

20:18.433 --> 20:21.368
i'll make some more tea.

20:21.368 --> 20:24.667
you see, tea isn't
compatible with porn.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.967
the two aren't linked.

20:26.967 --> 20:29.001
they're never gonna
be marketed together.

20:29.001 --> 20:30.800
i mean, how would that work?

20:30.800 --> 20:32.867
"double pack--
mags and bags."

20:32.867 --> 20:36.867
"more to the cupful!"
"rattle your china!"

20:36.867 --> 20:39.368
"i'm a little teapot
short and stout,

20:39.368 --> 20:41.500
here's my handle,
here's my--"

20:46.134 --> 20:47.934
how's this for naked?

20:49.101 --> 20:50.901
jane--

20:50.901 --> 20:52.734
yes, oliver?

20:52.734 --> 20:55.167
you're, um...

20:55.167 --> 20:57.167
you're...

20:57.167 --> 20:59.901
yes, i am, oliver.

20:59.901 --> 21:01.867
totally, in fact.

21:01.867 --> 21:03.834
totally, yes.

21:03.834 --> 21:06.600
right. thought so.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.433
aren't you gonna
say anything?

21:12.834 --> 21:15.567
i...really,

21:15.567 --> 21:17.901
really appreciate this.

21:17.901 --> 21:19.533
you're welcome.

21:20.667 --> 21:23.334
hope you didn't
go to any trouble.

21:23.334 --> 21:25.533
well...

21:26.934 --> 21:29.134
i just took my clothes off.

21:29.134 --> 21:32.167
that doesn't sound too bad.

21:36.567 --> 21:39.134
right, so, uh...

21:39.134 --> 21:41.201
what's the plan here?

21:41.201 --> 21:43.034
plan?

21:43.034 --> 21:47.067
with the whole...
nudity element.

21:47.067 --> 21:48.967
nothing.

21:48.967 --> 21:49.967
oh.

21:49.967 --> 21:52.567
now.
oh.

21:52.567 --> 21:54.700
i just wanted to check

21:54.700 --> 21:57.500
you were happy
with what you saw.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.800
i'm so happy,
i could go off.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.368
are you free on tuesday?

22:02.368 --> 22:05.533
right. fact is,
i can't actually remember

22:05.533 --> 22:07.867
a single thing about
the rest of my life
at the moment.

22:07.867 --> 22:10.600
i'm not absolutely sure
what tuesday is.

22:10.600 --> 22:15.134
why don't you
come over to my place
tuesday evening?

22:16.600 --> 22:17.901
okay.

22:20.467 --> 22:23.067
what's gonna happen?

22:23.067 --> 22:28.567
well, you're gonna
ring on the doorbell,
i'm gonna answer the door...

22:28.567 --> 22:29.901
right.

22:29.901 --> 22:34.001
...and at about midday
the following day...
yeah?

22:34.001 --> 22:36.734
...i'll put you down again.

22:39.867 --> 22:44.101
you're a very sweet man,
oliver morris.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.368
and, boy...

22:47.368 --> 22:50.767
am i ever gonna fix that.

22:54.001 --> 22:58.500
i'm just gonna
pop my clothes back on
and head off home.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.301
you don't have
any decent tea, anyway.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.167
this is tuesday.

23:04.167 --> 23:05.767
i know.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.533
ladies, i'll be
leaving you now.

23:10.533 --> 23:14.567
oliver morris is about
to discover a whole new octave.

23:16.268 --> 23:18.667
this is tuesday.
i know.

23:18.667 --> 23:20.067
fantastic!

23:20.067 --> 23:22.901
tonight's the night!
i know.

23:22.901 --> 23:25.101
it's gonna be great.
it's gonna be full-on.

23:25.101 --> 23:26.567
you think?

23:26.567 --> 23:30.134
as long as
you don't get nervous
and make an ass of yourself.

23:30.134 --> 23:31.634
nice one, patrick.

23:31.634 --> 23:33.834
it's been ages
since i've had sex.

23:33.834 --> 23:36.368
it's probably
changed completely by now!

23:36.368 --> 23:39.201
no, it's basically
the same process.

23:39.201 --> 23:41.800
what if there's
a new erogenous zone?

23:41.800 --> 23:44.334
i can never even find
the old ones.

23:44.334 --> 23:48.001
it's not like they're labeled,
those lying bastard sex manuals.

23:48.001 --> 23:51.934
like, bother to mention
the dotted lines
aren't for real!

23:51.934 --> 23:54.234
take it from her ex.

23:54.234 --> 23:58.101
jane will tell you
where the zones are.

23:58.101 --> 24:00.467
constantly,
like a running commentary.

24:05.567 --> 24:08.567
go to it, my friend.
good luck in there.

24:08.567 --> 24:11.834
thanks, guys.
i'll be thinking of you.

24:11.834 --> 24:14.400
probably best not,
actually.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.201
yeah, you're right.
good tip.

24:16.201 --> 24:18.167
okay.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.334
craziness!

24:22.867 --> 24:26.667
aw....
he'll be fine.

24:26.667 --> 24:29.667
how did you know?

24:29.667 --> 24:31.167
know what?

24:31.167 --> 24:34.934
about jane.
about the running
zone commentary.

24:34.934 --> 24:36.667
you've never
slept with her.

24:36.667 --> 24:39.134
of course i have.

24:40.867 --> 24:43.334
but you--you told sally--

24:43.334 --> 24:48.034
on the phone that night,
when we had the big
unstoppable phone call!

24:48.034 --> 24:50.834
you swore you'd never
slept with jane!

24:50.834 --> 24:54.101
right. yes, uh...

24:54.101 --> 24:55.667
of course.

24:55.667 --> 24:57.101
good point.

24:57.101 --> 24:59.767
but, you see,

24:59.767 --> 25:02.834
when you asked me
if i'd slept with jane

25:02.834 --> 25:06.934
and i said, "yes, i have,"
what i meant was...

25:06.934 --> 25:09.334
"no, i haven't."

25:09.334 --> 25:11.667
you slept with jane?!

25:11.667 --> 25:14.001
no, of course not.
never happened.

25:14.001 --> 25:16.334
and that's my last word
on the subject.

25:16.334 --> 25:20.234
patrick, i know you.
you can't keep a lie
like this going.

25:20.234 --> 25:21.500
yes, i can.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.234
damnit!

25:25.467 --> 25:28.567
jesus, patrick,
if you've lied to sally--

25:28.567 --> 25:30.167
i have not lied to sally.

25:30.167 --> 25:32.800
okay. when did this happen?

25:32.800 --> 25:36.067
the lying
or the sleeping with jane?
damnit!!!

25:37.500 --> 25:41.101
this was before sally, right?
ages before.

25:41.101 --> 25:44.334
look, can we stop with
the trick questions, please?

25:44.334 --> 25:47.368
of course, if jane starts
being in a couple,

25:47.368 --> 25:51.067
then her function
as spinster comparison
will be out the window.

25:51.067 --> 25:53.268
and frankly, i think
we need to keep one of us--

25:53.268 --> 25:55.901
oh, my god.
what?

25:55.901 --> 25:59.467
oh, my god.
oh, my god!

25:59.467 --> 26:01.500
what are you doing?
phoning steve.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.500
steve doesn't need
to know about this.

26:03.500 --> 26:06.700
this is never gonna fly.
you have to tell her.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.734
( cell phone rings )

26:08.734 --> 26:09.901
yeah?

26:09.901 --> 26:12.134
hi, darling, it's me.
i've got big news.

26:12.134 --> 26:14.734
if it's jane and oliver,
i've just heard.
bigger than that.

26:14.734 --> 26:16.767
what, jane and patrick?
you heard about that too?

26:16.767 --> 26:19.734
jane and patrick?!

26:19.734 --> 26:22.201
jane and patrick?

26:23.567 --> 26:25.433
susan?

26:25.433 --> 26:29.901
please, don't tell sally
i slept with jane.

26:29.901 --> 26:32.901
because anyway,
it didn't happen.

26:32.901 --> 26:35.600
and also it was
years ago. okay?

26:35.600 --> 26:39.268
"okay" is not the word.

26:39.268 --> 26:40.567
sally?

26:41.600 --> 26:42.734
darling.

26:43.767 --> 26:44.834
hello.

26:46.800 --> 26:50.234
so, you slept with jane
and didn't tell me.

26:50.234 --> 26:52.201
i can explain everything.

26:52.201 --> 26:53.700
( mouthing words )

26:53.700 --> 26:56.301
i'm listening.

26:56.301 --> 27:01.400
i was gonna tell you about it,
but instead, i lied.

27:02.834 --> 27:05.400
did you video it?

27:05.400 --> 27:07.034
what?

27:07.034 --> 27:09.834
you videotaped
most of your conquests.

27:09.834 --> 27:12.433
is there a video of jane
in your cupboard?

27:12.433 --> 27:15.533
don't be daft.
only an idiot
would keep the tape.

27:15.533 --> 27:17.867
thank you, susan.

27:17.867 --> 27:22.134
well, that will make
interesting viewing.

27:22.134 --> 27:24.967
no, no! sally,
you can't go!

27:24.967 --> 27:27.201
sorry, this is an emergency.

27:27.201 --> 27:28.334
yes, it is!

27:28.334 --> 27:30.400
is sally going to my flat?
bloody hell!

27:30.400 --> 27:32.268
sorry, steve.
i've gotta go.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.301
blimey!

27:37.301 --> 27:39.500
it's all happening,
isn't it?

27:39.500 --> 27:40.667
yes, it is.

27:40.667 --> 27:44.500
well, the shit's really
hit the fan now.

27:44.500 --> 27:47.867
yes, steve.
as have my waters.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.667
yeah.
what?!

27:49.667 --> 27:52.600
my water's just broke.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.867
the big news is,
i've just gone into labor.

27:55.867 --> 27:57.167
oh, my god!

27:57.167 --> 27:58.600
yes!

27:58.600 --> 28:00.667
wh-what do i--

28:01.734 --> 28:03.934
i-i-i don't--

28:03.934 --> 28:05.334
me, neither!

28:05.334 --> 28:07.134
how do you feel?

28:07.134 --> 28:10.467
like...i'm having a baby.

28:10.467 --> 28:12.600
yeah...

28:12.600 --> 28:14.167
me, too.

28:20.934 --> 28:24.034
* if you can't
make your mind up *

28:24.034 --> 28:28.368
* we'll never get started *

28:29.867 --> 28:32.867
* and i don't want to wind up *

28:32.867 --> 28:35.201
* being parted

28:35.201 --> 28:37.567
* broken-hearted

28:38.901 --> 28:42.101
* so if you really love me

28:42.101 --> 28:44.001
* say yes

28:44.001 --> 28:46.700
* and please don't tell me *

28:46.700 --> 28:47.800
* perhaps

28:47.800 --> 28:48.934
* perhaps

28:48.934 --> 28:50.734
* perhaps

28:51.305 --> 28:57.902
