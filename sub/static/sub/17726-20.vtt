00:01.035 --> 00:03.504
- Previously,
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:03.537 --> 00:05.273
- I'm in wedding mode, baby.
I'm rock solid.

00:05.306 --> 00:08.076
- [humming]
Just think it looks so chic.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.377
- Do you want to come
to your brother's wedding?

00:09.410 --> 00:12.380
- Of course I do, but I don't
have a lot of money.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.282
- If we could take care
of your flights and stuff--

00:14.315 --> 00:15.383
- Is this--is this real?

00:15.416 --> 00:16.250
- Yeah, we're not
messing around.

00:16.284 --> 00:17.651
- Listen, is it cool if
all three of you

00:17.685 --> 00:19.187
get time off work?
- That's fine.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.421
That's no problem.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.390
- Shay is in the studio
all of the time.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.092
Nothing else to do. Shay was in
the studio all night.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.260
I was fifth wheel
a lot this weekend

00:26.294 --> 00:27.528
'cause I know you were busy--
- Yeah.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.263
- Finishing that stuff
in the studio.

00:29.297 --> 00:32.266
- We are in the woods.
- Hello!

00:32.300 --> 00:35.403
- Oh, my God!
[all shouting]

00:35.436 --> 00:38.406
So happy you're here!
- Yay!

00:38.439 --> 00:40.408
- What up, dude?
- I'm shedding a tear.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.176
- Are you crying?
- I'm shedding a tear!

00:42.210 --> 00:43.611
- Guess who missed his flight?
- Sandoval.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.114
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.615
- Here we are.
- Can't believe we're actually

00:47.648 --> 00:49.417
here and it's actually
happening.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.585
And I'm bloody ordaining it.
How did this happen?

00:51.619 --> 00:54.322
- I got to call Sandoval.
- Wait, what's wrong?

00:54.355 --> 00:56.290
- F---ing brothers
missed their flight.

00:56.324 --> 00:59.293
Are you f---ing kidding?
Your f---ing brother's wedding?

00:59.327 --> 01:00.661
What the f--- is wrong with you?
- Shh!

01:00.694 --> 01:04.198
[Dena Deadly's
"Raise Your Glass"]

01:04.232 --> 01:07.868
- * You know
that it's our time *

01:07.901 --> 01:10.171
* These are the best days

01:10.204 --> 01:13.174
* Of our lives

01:13.207 --> 01:16.110
* Just raise
your glasses high *

01:16.144 --> 01:21.215
* This one's
for you tonight *

01:21.249 --> 01:23.651
- * We belong together

01:23.684 --> 01:28.189
* Oh, oh, take my heart
and fold it, baby *

01:28.222 --> 01:29.557
- We kind of talked about this
last night.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.192
I'll just go over it
real quick.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.527
We can just do like long
blankets out here.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.596
We'll set up buffet kind of
in this area too,

01:35.629 --> 01:37.331
with the whole taco bar,
and just leave it open

01:37.365 --> 01:39.200
for a couple hours for people
to kind of graze

01:39.233 --> 01:40.534
and help themselves.
- Love it.

01:40.568 --> 01:43.337
- So for hour rehearsal dinner,
we decided to go

01:43.371 --> 01:45.239
more understated, you know?

01:45.273 --> 01:47.141
We wanted it to be
casual and fun.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.476
- Let's go over, um,
this way, you guys,

01:48.509 --> 01:50.411
and we'll go look at the
reception area real quick.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.680
- It's Taco Tuesday.
We love tacos.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.349
- Your officiant, Lisa,
do you want her to walk--

01:55.383 --> 01:57.251
be a part of the processional,
or do you want her

01:57.285 --> 01:58.652
to just be standing,
staged up there?

01:58.686 --> 02:00.721
- Lisa doesn't really walk.
She floats, by the way.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.589
Just...
- [laughs]

02:01.622 --> 02:03.357
- So we can ask her what
she wants to do.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.725
She's gonna be here
for the rehearsal?

02:04.758 --> 02:06.627
- Yeah.
I feel very calm.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.530
Tom and I have gone
through so much

02:09.563 --> 02:12.733
and planned this beautiful
destination wedding,

02:12.766 --> 02:16.570
and now we're finally here, and
I'm going to marry my Bubba.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.172
I'm gonna go get ready before

02:18.206 --> 02:19.373
everyone else starts
to get here.

02:19.407 --> 02:20.708
- Okay. All right, Bubba.
- All right.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.743
- She's cool.
- Also.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.579
May have had a little num-na
of an edible this morning,

02:25.613 --> 02:27.648
so I'm feeling pretty relaxed.

02:27.681 --> 02:31.185
- My kid!
- Oh, my God!

02:31.219 --> 02:33.654
Mama Dukes, hey.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.424
I'm gonna cry.
- You look handsome.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.591
How's my boy?

02:37.625 --> 02:40.228
- It's so special for me
to have my mom here.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.663
Like, I love her deeply,
and we're very close.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.232
Have we ever done
a shot together?

02:44.265 --> 02:45.666
- Honey, is that real?
I was thinking like--

02:45.699 --> 02:47.401
- It's Fireball.
You get the small one.

02:47.435 --> 02:48.402
Ready?
- Yeah.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.438
- Um...
- To my handsome buck!

02:50.471 --> 02:51.439
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.341
- I don't get to see you lot,
but I love you

02:53.374 --> 02:54.542
more than you could
possibly imagine.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.210
- Okay.
- I really do.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.346
- And we'll do this for Grandpa
Woody and your dad.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.547
- Okay. [laughs]
- To you.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.215
- And the boys.
- And the boys!

03:01.249 --> 03:02.550
- I would love
to have my brothers

03:02.583 --> 03:03.784
and sister and my dad here.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.553
Can't afford
to fly 'em all out,

03:05.586 --> 03:07.288
so having her at the wedding

03:07.321 --> 03:08.789
is just that much more special.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.624
- Ah!
- Look at you!

03:10.658 --> 03:11.759
both: [roaring]
- I'm ready.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.294
- You're not a drinker.
- I'm not.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.462
- You're not. [laughing]

03:14.495 --> 03:15.696
Come on, we'll get you a joint.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.431
- All right.
- You're not a smoker either.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.666
We'll get you a glass of wine.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.301
We're gonna go tubing
in a little bit.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.635
You want to go tubing? [laughs]
You want to go?

03:21.669 --> 03:23.704
- No.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.239
- I'm trying to get
ahold of Tom.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.508
The brothers missed
their f---ing flight.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.009
- Missed it?
- He has all their

03:29.042 --> 03:31.279
flight itinerary information.
- He might be on--let me--

03:31.312 --> 03:32.546
- I can't get ahold of him.
- I keep calling him--

03:32.580 --> 03:34.382
- We keep trying to FaceTime,
but we can't get ahold of him.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.549
- I'm gonna go get my phone.
I'll be right back.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.618
- Okay, and if you text him,
just text him to call us.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.453
- Yeah.
- I couldn't think of anything

03:39.487 --> 03:41.522
more worse...
sorry, is that a word?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.457
More worse?
No, is that--is that right?

03:43.491 --> 03:45.459
I couldn't think of any--
no, that's not right.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.595
More worse? That's not--
that doesn't sound right.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.864
Is it? Is that right?
More worse?

03:50.898 --> 03:52.600
Can I Google that?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.768
Is that right?
Worse? More worse.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.270
I couldn't think--

03:56.304 --> 03:59.540
I couldn't think
of anything worse!

03:59.573 --> 04:01.742
No, that's not right either.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.745
More worse.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.381
I couldn't think of anything
that could suck more.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.749
You have one job!

04:08.782 --> 04:11.319
One job!
F---ing asshole.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.354
Do you know how much money we
spent on those f---ing flights?

04:13.387 --> 04:14.788
They don't have a dollar
to their name,

04:14.822 --> 04:15.689
so now I got to pay for it.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.558
I could see
if it's one person, okay.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.760
Two people, not really.
But three of you?

04:19.793 --> 04:20.794
- I know.
- To sit through--

04:20.828 --> 04:22.029
are you f---ing kidding?

04:23.664 --> 04:24.732
This is a big deal because this
is Schwartz's wedding present,

04:25.733 --> 04:27.267
and it has to go right,
and all they had to do

04:28.302 --> 04:29.303
was show up on time,
and they couldn't do that.

04:30.170 --> 04:30.804
- Oh, it's Taco Tuesday!
Dude, we got--

04:31.672 --> 04:33.474
we got mini, um, f---ing
sombreros too.

04:33.507 --> 04:33.541
both: Yeah.
- My mom got here.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.511
And I burst into tears and then
we did a shot of Fireball.

04:37.545 --> 04:38.679
- Aw, you cried?

04:39.747 --> 04:40.448
- I've never taken a shot with
my mom in my life.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.350
- Schwartz, right now,
since Katie's not here,

04:43.216 --> 04:43.684
we're gonna--we're gonna
do it to you.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.319
- I can't accept that.
- To the groom!

04:46.253 --> 04:46.687
- I'd be shady--all right.
- He's so sweet!

04:47.655 --> 04:48.689
- Yeah, you can.
- The biggest thing for me,

04:49.723 --> 04:50.891
being a bridesmaid,
is going to be making sure

04:52.159 --> 04:53.527
everyone's in a good mood
and having a good time.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.396
Get everybody to party.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.597
[all shouting]

04:56.630 --> 04:59.567
- Love you, love you,
love you, love you!

04:59.600 --> 05:00.701
- Ow!

05:00.734 --> 05:03.637
- Schwartz is
in very good spirits.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.705
- Yeah.
- This is gonna be a lot of fun.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.941
The rehearsal dinner,
we got a piñata and tacos.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.911
Tubing!
- Oh, yeah, we gotta go tubing.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.946
- I really don't know
what's going on with Shay.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.684
I don't know if he's tired,
if he's not feeling well,

05:16.717 --> 05:18.952
if he's doing something else
I don't know about.

05:18.986 --> 05:22.756
His behavior lately
has just been off.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.858
I'm so happy for them, though.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.561
- Yup.

05:27.595 --> 05:28.962
Good times.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.499
- * Hey! Hey!

05:31.532 --> 05:32.800
- Ah, a bug!

05:32.833 --> 05:35.569
- This is like
the craziest thing ever.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.371
- This is a bitch to get here.

05:37.405 --> 05:38.839
*

05:38.872 --> 05:41.442
- * Whoa, whoa

05:42.710 --> 05:44.144
- Whoo!

05:44.177 --> 05:46.714
- Yo, this is the best group
activity we've ever done.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.417
- Don't want this water
to dingy my diamond.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.451
*

05:50.484 --> 05:51.685
- Whoo!

05:51.719 --> 05:53.387
- Bye!

05:53.421 --> 05:55.823
- This is awesome! Whoo-hoo!

05:55.856 --> 05:59.493
- This group of friends,
it's a f---ing crazy train.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.828
As much as we have hated,
and fought,

06:00.861 --> 06:02.463
and thrown each other
under the bus,

06:02.496 --> 06:04.164
and whether we all
may not be, like,

06:04.197 --> 06:06.434
completely in love
with one another,

06:06.467 --> 06:07.635
we are in love
with Katie and Tom.

06:07.668 --> 06:12.440
And we're, like, actually
going to their wedding tomorrow.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.607
F---.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.676
- [gasps] There's a bug!
That was a bug!

06:15.709 --> 06:18.879
Wait, what the--
- So many bugs!

06:18.912 --> 06:22.015
- Leeches? It's an actual leech?

06:22.049 --> 06:25.519
I don't like bugs.
I don't like dirt.

06:25.553 --> 06:29.623
Who does?
Who likes bugs and dirt?

06:29.657 --> 06:30.891
Gross, they probably
are leeches.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.192
I don't want Lyme disease, guys.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.562
I don't want diseases
in general.

06:34.595 --> 06:41.435
*

06:41.469 --> 06:42.736
[sighs]

06:42.770 --> 06:44.672
I mean, this is like
the first flight

06:44.705 --> 06:47.975
I've ever missed.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.943
Okay, I'm lying.
I've missed tons of flights.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.012
But not in a while.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.881
And not for important sh--.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.750
- Hey, you guys, stop!
- Are we stopping?

06:56.784 --> 06:58.586
Oh, 'cause we have to walk back?

06:58.619 --> 07:00.521
- We got to go around.
- Dude.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.890
*

07:02.923 --> 07:05.025
- I'm sorry that we didn't get
to go down longer.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.728
- Tom!
- God?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.763
- Ah!
- God, is that you?

07:09.797 --> 07:11.665
- [laughing]
- Ah!

07:11.699 --> 07:14.668
- Oh! Oh!
I'm so sorry.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.004
- Tom, just--
there's a lesson here.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.072
- I'm sorry, guys.
I actually--

07:19.106 --> 07:20.173
I got all the way
to the airport.

07:20.207 --> 07:23.977
I realized I forgot
my suit at home like an idiot.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.780
I get here, and I was gonna rent
a car anyways,

07:26.814 --> 07:27.915
but I had to rent an SUV.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.650
Do you know why I had
to rent an SUV?

07:29.683 --> 07:31.084
- Why?
- Only thing available?

07:31.118 --> 07:33.687
- Because what the hell else
am I gonna fit

07:33.721 --> 07:36.890
50 12-packs of Coors Light
and 10 cases of Blue Moon?

07:36.924 --> 07:39.893
- 50?
- 50. Yes.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.630
- And totally redeemed yourself!

07:42.663 --> 07:44.097
[laughing]

07:44.131 --> 07:47.701
- I love, love, love, love
Tom Sandoval.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.803
- Look at me: all that matters
is that you're here.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.505
- I know.
- Oh, sorry.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.006
- Ooh, hey.
- Cheers.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.575
All right, let's get
in the river.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.577
- Let's go now.
Let's go, buddy.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.911
- Get in there, drunkie.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.847
- Get on that pink
flamingo, bitch.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.916
- Here come on, now, come on.
Step into my office.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.718
- Ha ha! Yeah!

08:04.752 --> 08:06.654
- Dude, what's going on
with his brothers?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.589
- So, they got
to the airport late.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.757
They missed their flight,
so then

08:09.790 --> 08:11.692
they missed their
connecting flight.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.927
Which is really annoying,
but, like,

08:13.961 --> 08:15.763
who am I to f---ing talk?

08:15.796 --> 08:17.998
I missed my flight.
- Hey, what are you doing?

08:18.031 --> 08:19.833
- Hey, it wasn't one, okay?
It wasn't two.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.635
That--aw, man--
but there's three of 'em.

08:21.669 --> 08:24.137
- Their flight lands at 6:05.
- Oh.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.674
We might still even be at dinner
when they get here.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.141
- Yeah. Okay.
- I mean, Schwarz is over there

08:28.175 --> 08:30.711
floating on a pink flamingo.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.613
He's kind of having
the time of his life.

08:32.646 --> 08:35.082
- Ah! Ah!

Don't you?

08:48.929 --> 08:51.131
- Love the creek.
- It's so romantic.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.769
This is so Katie,
it's unbelievable.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.137
I have no idea
how she found this place.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.138
- I love it.

[train whistle tooting]

It's the train coming now.

Holy cow, I hope
that doesn't come

09:07.948 --> 09:09.917
right in the middle
of the service.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.185
I feel like I need to talk
to Tom and Katie

09:12.219 --> 09:16.023
about this, because they've had
no input in it at all,

09:16.056 --> 09:17.257
and they might hate it.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.927
I'm a little bit nervous because
I'm officiating the wedding,

09:19.960 --> 09:21.929
but I've had no direction
whatsoever.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.897

do you f---er

and spend

09:24.998 --> 09:27.067

Hello!

09:33.974 --> 09:36.910
- Look at the train!
- I love this here.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.912
- Our present's on
the last carriage.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.681
- You look gorgeous.
- Hey.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.651
Thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, sure.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.819
- Mwah! Is this happening?
You got to pinch me--

- Pinch me. Is this real?

[train clacking]

09:49.890 --> 09:51.825
- I want to do whatever
you want.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.927
- Our thing is, like, not
to have it super long,

09:53.961 --> 09:56.964
drawn-out, but also
not make it, like,

09:56.997 --> 10:00.000
too fast and too,
like, blown over.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.737
What's your first line?

10:03.771 --> 10:05.906
- Oh, no.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.174

10:07.207 --> 10:10.010
- Um, I don't. Sh--.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.980
But I have the essence of it.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.733

would ever make it here.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.870

are searching for."

the ups and downs

10:40.908 --> 10:43.043
in Tom and I's relationship.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.946
I've never felt more myself
around anyone besides him.

done something right.

of everyone here

to officiate our wedding.

in a forest.

- I've had my wedding planned

12:01.922 --> 12:03.757
since I was, like,
in middle school.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.994
There's a castle in Kentucky,
and I want to be married there.

12:07.027 --> 12:10.297
It's beautiful, and I want
red roses everywhere.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.300

in the wintery time.

- Whoa.

Wait, we're wearing jackets?

I didn't know
we were wearing jackets.

seven jackets with me.

Now, come on, baby.

you ladies first.

in order here,

take the guys.

We're gonna line up
right down there.

- Oh, no. That's too close.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.277
- The only reason that Stassi is
standing next to Katie

12:57.310 --> 13:00.914
is because Sandoval and I
refused to walk together.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.850
It doesn't matter
where I stand.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.351
I know that I'm number one
in Katie's eyes.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.953
- Hey, are you gonna do one
of those to the crowd?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.487
Like this.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.957
If I was officiating
the wedding, it'd be a party.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.859
We'd have shots
right off the bat.

I'd be like, "Hey, swap rings.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.863
Give each other a little peck.
Let's party."

13:15.896 --> 13:17.965
I personally don't want to be
standing up there that long.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.366
I got bad knees.

Schwartz, Schwartz.

Did it hit you like it hit me
when you saw the white chairs?

13:25.572 --> 13:28.275
- Dude, yeah.
- I have so many fond memories

13:28.308 --> 13:30.443
of when me and Jax and Schwartz
lived together.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.113
In fact, I remember
when Schwartz

13:33.146 --> 13:34.948
first brought Katie home.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.383
- I feel like I'm a guy
who's out of body

13:36.416 --> 13:37.985
watching another guy
getting married.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.519
- I'd plastered a bunch of porn

13:39.552 --> 13:41.021
all over the back of his door,

13:41.054 --> 13:44.457
so when she closed it,
she'd be sure to see it.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.860
And now,
they're getting married.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.128
Like, it's crazy.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.030
- Should we go eat?

13:50.063 --> 13:51.398
- Yeah!

- Hey, what's going on?

This is the moment I've been
looking forward to for so long.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.016
- Are those your dress slippers?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.350
I thought you had better ones
for tomorrow.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.886
- Katie vetoed that.
Trust me, I--

14:12.920 --> 14:14.454
I did say that, 'cause
I'm wearing the full tux.

14:14.487 --> 14:15.889
I said, "Bubba,
can I wear those?"

14:15.923 --> 14:17.357
And she said--
- You're wearing a tux?

14:17.390 --> 14:20.027
Like...sweatpants?
- A real tux. Custom-made tux.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.428
- Darling, would
you like a drink?

14:21.461 --> 14:22.930
- Would I like a drink?
Are you kidding me?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.064
I need a drink.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.999
- I mean, you can't really go
wrong with any of these.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.568
We're not driving.
Let's have a good time.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.338
Hey, any time I can schmooze Kim
is a win in my book.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.539
I mean, I have
a huge crush on her.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.007
Your little boy's
getting married.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.077
- I know, how often
can you say that?

14:37.110 --> 14:39.112
- Mother of the groom.
- Nice to meet you.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.014
I would marry Kim
just so Tom Schwartz

14:41.048 --> 14:42.115
would have to call me "Dad."

14:42.149 --> 14:43.450
- Can we just like have a moment

14:43.483 --> 14:45.953
to like, be like, "This is
f---ing happening."

14:45.986 --> 14:47.955
There's not gonna be another
time when, like,

14:47.988 --> 14:50.590
we have two best friends
that are marrying each other.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.493
I feel like the past, like,
seven years I've had with them

14:53.526 --> 14:55.362
is, like, flashing
before my eyes.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.663
- F---ing--
- Do not f---ing

14:56.696 --> 14:57.931
say "F--- you, bitch."

14:57.965 --> 14:58.999
- Are you serious?
- Stassi!

14:59.032 --> 15:01.534
What the f---
do you want from me?

15:01.568 --> 15:03.036
Shut the f--- up, Stassi.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.671
- You are a f---ing bitch.

15:04.704 --> 15:09.376
- I wonder if one of them
wrote me into their vows.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.477
It's possible.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.112
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.213
- Okay, cool.
- Hi, this is Tom's mom.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.482
- Mama Dukes, wait,
I want to give you something.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.550
I've gotten my mom cards
and little trinkets,

15:17.584 --> 15:19.052
but I feel like
I've never really

15:19.086 --> 15:21.488
gotten her anything nice.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.023
- Look at that.
- That's not real.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.624
- Yeah, with white diamonds
and rose gold.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.726
- Put it on.
- Yeah, of course.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.628
This is my mom,
who I love so much,

15:28.661 --> 15:30.497
and she's done so much for me.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.632
- It's so beautiful.
- Yeah.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.202
- I love it,
and I love the shape.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.604
- Not that a ring compensates
for all of that,

15:37.637 --> 15:39.239
but I just wanted something
for her to,

15:39.272 --> 15:40.440
uh, remember the moment by.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.010
You've been an amazing mom.
You've done so much for me.

- Was it one date?
Was it two?

15:50.550 --> 15:52.519
- Mom, it's been
like a lot of dates.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.088
- [gasps]
When do I get details?

15:55.122 --> 15:58.091
- Mom, I just like him.
- She does.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.094
- I just like him, and it's--
- Does he like you?

16:01.128 --> 16:04.431
- I hope so.
- So, how many dates

16:04.464 --> 16:06.633
before that special moment?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.268
Nine? Ten?
- This is uncomfortable.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.138
- Mom, it's 2016.
- 11. 12.

16:11.171 --> 16:15.542
- The first night, he went down
on me like seven times.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.178
And I cried two of the times
that I came.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.013
- We--we don't have to talk
about that part.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.715
- Yeah, we had a good time.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.152
And I cried.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.021
I don't know.
I can't control myself.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.223
Which is probably why he'll
never talk to me again.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.159
- Honey, he's not gonna
buy the cow

16:32.192 --> 16:35.228
if he can get the milk for free.

16:35.262 --> 16:37.464
[overlapping party chatter]

16:37.497 --> 16:39.766
- The triplets are here.
Right now.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.268
Waiting.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.203
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've just received word

16:43.236 --> 16:46.573
that the triplets have arrived.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.575
What's up, guys?
- Hey, Sandoval.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.543
- Sh--. All right, all right.
- You did great.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.612
This is--I couldn't have picked
something better myself.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.547
- All right, wait, wait, whoa.
Who's who?

16:54.581 --> 16:56.149
- Call my Billy.
- I'm Bert.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.650
- Bert. Brandon?
- Yeah.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.785
- Bert.
When it came to dressing

16:58.818 --> 17:02.189
the triplets, I mean these guys
don't own a dress belt,

17:02.222 --> 17:04.557
dress shoes, anything.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.194
So I had to put together not
only their wedding outfits,

17:07.227 --> 17:09.096
but also the outfits
they were gonna be wearing

17:09.129 --> 17:10.730
to the rehearsal dinner,
plus I wanted them

17:10.763 --> 17:13.533
to look good for when
Schwartz first sees them.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.635
- Yeah, man, how do--
- You guys look great, man.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.538
*

17:18.571 --> 17:20.307
- Who is hitting on my husband?

17:20.340 --> 17:21.508
- I know, I just--
- You did.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.643
I don't think
you could handle him.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.612
- Katie definitely
picked this place out.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.746
- [burps] Dude, Katie--
- What are you talking about?

17:26.779 --> 17:29.549
I feel like Tom was here
streaming up the lights himself.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.085
He 100% was here.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.820
- [laughs]
- Me and Jax, we wanted

17:33.853 --> 17:36.523
to give you your wedding present
a little early.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.757
- Okay, do you mind?
- I feel like--

17:37.790 --> 17:39.192
- Do you mind?
- It's not steaks that

17:39.226 --> 17:40.293
were between your butt cheeks--

17:40.327 --> 17:41.794
What the f---?

17:41.828 --> 17:43.863
- What's up?
- Oh, my God!

17:43.896 --> 17:45.732
Billy!
- What's up?

17:45.765 --> 17:47.634
- No way, dude.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.569
You guys did--
- Listen.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.870
- Yeah.
- We tried.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.772
We tried for all of 'em.
- What up?

17:52.805 --> 17:56.276
[laughing]
Brother, what's up, buddy?

17:56.309 --> 17:58.178
- See, you guys are
making me cry.

17:58.211 --> 18:01.114
Hey, man.
- Just wanted to...[laughs].

18:01.148 --> 18:03.650
[soft music]

18:03.683 --> 18:05.185
- Tom.
- Oh, this guy too.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.654
- We made it.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.822
- You can't have a wedding
without your brothers here, man.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.259
Come on, now.

18:12.292 --> 18:16.263
- [sniffs] Man--
oh, my God, man.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.165
[sobbing]
- [laughs]

18:18.198 --> 18:21.134
So...
- Dude, oh, man.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.203
My mind is just blown.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.372
And my brain's not even
processing it.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.274
I'm looking at them,
I know it's my brothers,

18:27.307 --> 18:29.909
but it's like my--
my mind won't accept it.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.644
Dude, this is amazing.
- You look great.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.281
- I texted you guys today!
I was like, "Holy sh--."

18:34.314 --> 18:36.183
- Tom and Jax told me
that they were going

18:36.216 --> 18:38.185
to fly Tom's brothers out,

18:38.218 --> 18:41.421
and I just knew how overcome

18:41.454 --> 18:43.190
with emotion Tom would be.

18:43.223 --> 18:46.859
So I was excited to keep
that secret from him.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.428
- I'm shocked.
- They're here.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.163
- Hi!
- How are you?

18:50.197 --> 18:52.699
- You guys look
all sharp and sh--.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.434
Did Tom dress you guys?
- Yeah.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.902
- Get over here, man.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.737
To see him so happy

18:57.770 --> 18:59.372
the day before his wedding

18:59.406 --> 19:01.174
is amazing.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.875
- Oh, my gosh, Lisa.
I forgot that you were here.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.178
- Oh, my God, I heard about it,

19:05.212 --> 19:07.247
and I was sworn to secrecy.
- You guys all knew about it?

19:07.280 --> 19:08.915
- The three of you, I need to
have a close look at you.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.317
Hold on a second.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.885
So you're absolutely
all identical.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.454
- Uh, do we look a like?

19:14.487 --> 19:15.722
- Can't believe that
they've brought

19:15.755 --> 19:17.390
his three brothers here.

19:17.424 --> 19:20.860
You see, there is some good
in Jax Taylor.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.396
You sometimes got to dig
really deep,

19:23.430 --> 19:24.797
but it's there somewhere.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.433
- Oh, my God, I can't even
believe you're here.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.801
How are so many great people
in my life here?

19:28.835 --> 19:31.204
- Oh, come on, dude.
You deserve it, man.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.806
- I will never, for as long
as I live, forget.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.210
It's truly the nicest thing that
anyone's ever done for me.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.845
- Jax!
- You little bastards.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.681
You little bastards, bring it in
for the good stuff, all right?

19:41.714 --> 19:43.216
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I swear to God,

19:43.250 --> 19:45.752
I wanted to kill
you mother----ers.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.254
I wanted to rip my teeth out.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.756
And then stick a spoon
in my eye.

19:49.789 --> 19:52.959
And then drag my body
behind a semi truck.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.694
That was what it was like

19:54.727 --> 19:56.429
booking those three
a plane ticket.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.997
- If you want to blame anybody,
blame him.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.367
- But my mission was
to get Tom to cry.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.768
Mission accomplished.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.304
- Oh, my God!
My brothers!

20:04.337 --> 20:06.773
- Coming up...
- I wanted to grab you

20:06.806 --> 20:08.441
by the scruff of the neck
and say,

20:08.475 --> 20:10.310
"What the f--- are you doing?"

20:13.913 --> 20:16.816
[overlapping party chatter]

20:16.849 --> 20:18.585
[upbeat music]

20:18.618 --> 20:20.787
- This is my brother, Rick.
- Oh, my goodness.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.889
So nice to meet you!
- Where's your hubby?

20:22.922 --> 20:23.890
- Uh, he was upstairs.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.793
He just wanted to lay
by the fan for a bit.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.796
[fan blowing]

20:29.829 --> 20:31.331
*

20:31.364 --> 20:32.965
He said, though,
the fresh water earlier,

20:32.999 --> 20:35.402
that it made his skin
feel better.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.437
- He was a rescue?
- With no fur.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.872
- You know when something's not
perfect and you love 'em anyway?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.708
The way you loved Jax?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.676
[laughter]

20:43.710 --> 20:44.777
- I'm so embarrassed.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.813
I don't know what happened
to me during that time.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.349
- If you're embarrassed, I'm not
here to tell you I told you so,

20:49.382 --> 20:50.983
but I told you so.
- [laughing]

20:51.017 --> 20:54.687
- [laughs] I always had
so much hope for you

20:54.721 --> 20:58.425
because you had a strength,
and a sharpness, and--

20:58.458 --> 21:03.430
and a sense of humor to see
the good things about life,

21:03.463 --> 21:06.599
and, um, and I felt that you
walked away from it,

21:06.633 --> 21:09.569
and I wanted to grab you by
the scruff of the neck

21:09.602 --> 21:11.671
and say, "What the f---
are you doing?

21:11.704 --> 21:13.005
Don't give it up."

21:13.039 --> 21:14.273
You're being ridiculous.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.876
You're not the girl that runs
away and hides in the corner.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.445
You're a strong woman.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.546
You know what I'm saying?

21:19.579 --> 21:20.813
- I'm sorry that I let you down.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.882
- Maybe you needed to grow up.

21:22.915 --> 21:26.886
Maybe you needed to find out
for yourself, you know?

21:26.919 --> 21:28.888
- I made mistakes,
but the only thing I can do

21:28.921 --> 21:30.523
is try and make it better.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.892
- Yeah.
Well, you have.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.027
You have, and I think
it takes a big person

21:35.061 --> 21:37.697
to say, "I've made mistakes."

21:37.730 --> 21:41.601
- It's nice to get a little
validation from Lisa.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.770
Her saying that,
that's like as big

21:43.803 --> 21:45.805
of a compliment
as she's gonna give me.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.507
And I really appreciate it.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.577
- Here you are.

21:50.610 --> 21:51.678
- This is beautiful.

21:51.711 --> 21:52.879
- I mean, everything's
taken care of.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.947
We got margaritas, and tacos,

21:54.981 --> 21:56.916
and the rehearsal's
all good to go.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.485
- We're good.

21:58.518 --> 22:01.020
But you're my baby girl.
- Mm-hmm.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.655
- Always will be.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.525
And you're better looking
than I am.

22:05.558 --> 22:08.828
- Well, that--
that's an obvious thing.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.563
- [laughing]

22:10.597 --> 22:11.931
- It's kind of like,
remember when we went

22:11.964 --> 22:14.567
to father-daughter sock hop,
and I wore a--

22:14.601 --> 22:17.036
what do they call those skirts?
Poodle skirt?

22:17.069 --> 22:18.805
It feels like that,
but different.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.773
[laughing]

22:20.807 --> 22:21.941
- Slightly.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.076
- I wanted to just feel, like,

22:24.110 --> 22:26.713
comfortable in our element,
and that's, you know,

22:26.746 --> 22:28.648
with the people that we've
invited and the place

22:28.681 --> 22:29.816
that we've chose, that's helped.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.818
- This is beautiful.

22:31.851 --> 22:32.952
- I didn't know that you and Mom

22:32.985 --> 22:35.555
hadn't seen each other
for four years.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.957
- [sighs]

22:37.990 --> 22:40.560
- I'm very happy that both
my mom and my dad

22:40.593 --> 22:42.495
could be here for
the wedding because

22:42.529 --> 22:44.697
they split up a few years ago,

22:44.731 --> 22:46.499
and we actually haven't
all been together

22:46.533 --> 22:48.768
as a family for probably
almost five years.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.537
- Well, it's tough
not seeing you guys,

22:50.570 --> 22:52.972
because, uh,
you're in California.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.974
- Dad, come visit me.
- I will.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.676
I'm sorry, baby.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.578
- I love both my mom
and my dad,

22:58.611 --> 22:59.746
and when they were together,
they were great,

22:59.779 --> 23:00.947
but at some point,

23:00.980 --> 23:04.050
they stopped being
partners in life,

23:04.083 --> 23:06.986
and Tom and I have faced some of
those similar things,

23:07.019 --> 23:09.989
so I think it gives us
a reason

23:10.022 --> 23:11.724
to maybe do things differently.

23:11.758 --> 23:12.925
I'm happy you're here.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.026
- I love you.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.695
- I love you too.

23:15.728 --> 23:20.500
*

23:20.533 --> 23:22.869
- 1 1/2 glasses of wine,
and I'm probably not

23:22.902 --> 23:24.737
functioning as well
as I should.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.507
- I'm not functioning
very well either.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.876
Wait, what about the piñata?
We didn't hit the piñata yet.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.612
- I don't like that because
to me, that's animal abuse.

23:32.645 --> 23:33.713
- Oh, it's a little pony.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.014
I had a "Little Mermaid" party,

23:35.047 --> 23:37.850
and I had an Ariel piñata,

23:37.884 --> 23:39.552
and when it came time,
I couldn't do it.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.721
- Oh, cried your eyes out.
- I couldn't do it.

23:41.754 --> 23:42.955
So we kept her--
- Pandora would cry

23:42.989 --> 23:44.757
when stuffing fell out of...

23:44.791 --> 23:47.727
So, how are you and Shay?
- Amazing.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.795
- Are you?
- Yeah.

23:48.828 --> 23:49.962
- No drugs?
- No.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.631
- What about drinking?
- No.

23:51.664 --> 23:52.999
He hasn't drank
since December 3rd.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.000
- Really.

23:54.033 --> 23:57.036
- His music is, like, amazing.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.771
I mean, he's--
he's doing so well.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.840
He's just in such a good place.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.575
His head's clear.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.043
We have, like,
our, like, spark back.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.078
Like, that, like, giddy feeling,

24:06.112 --> 24:08.047
like, when we, like, kiss,
it's like,

24:08.080 --> 24:10.049
the first time again,
and I didn't know

24:10.082 --> 24:11.784
if we were gonna be able
to get that back

24:11.818 --> 24:13.620
after last year,
now it's just, like--

24:13.653 --> 24:15.655
I get, like, excited
when he comes home, and--

24:15.688 --> 24:16.856
- Really?

24:16.889 --> 24:17.890
Scheana's telling me that

24:17.924 --> 24:20.159
everything's going well
in paradise,

24:20.192 --> 24:22.061
and that's what
I've got to believe.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.964
I mean, their marriage, I hope,
is in a good place,

24:24.997 --> 24:26.165
but I--I don't know.

24:26.198 --> 24:29.101
I never see Shay.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.803
That's great.

24:30.837 --> 24:31.971
- Yeah.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.806
Sober looks good on him.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.142
- Sober would probably look good
on any of us, really.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.210
- [laughs]
- F--- that.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.947
*

24:40.980 --> 24:42.715
- Take the bat.

24:42.749 --> 24:43.716
- Okay.

24:43.750 --> 24:45.718
- Lala said she's on her way.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.153
all: Yeah!
- Hey, Bubba.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.821
Let me finish it.
- Oh!

24:48.855 --> 24:50.590
Don't let go of the bat!

24:50.623 --> 24:53.192
all: Yeah!

24:53.225 --> 24:55.828
- Cheers, guys.
both: Cheers.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.797
- For once,
we're all getting along,

24:57.830 --> 24:59.699
and I feel like
it's a good omen.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.601
A good sign of things to come.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.603
- This mother----er's
getting married tomorrow!

25:03.636 --> 25:04.904
[all cheering]

25:04.937 --> 25:06.706
He's getting married tomorrow!

25:06.739 --> 25:09.141
- Cheers, guys.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.977
- Come on, let's just go
and have a quick chat

25:11.010 --> 25:13.112
before I got to go home.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.147
Do you feel ready for tomorrow?
- Yes!

25:15.181 --> 25:16.749
- Yeah.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.751
- I want to, like, really
fine-tune

25:18.785 --> 25:20.853
and finish the vows, but yeah,
other than that, like--

25:20.887 --> 25:22.054
- Have you not done
the vows yet?

25:22.088 --> 25:26.058
- No, I have--no, but it's--
I have to, like, fine-tune them.

25:26.092 --> 25:27.794
- When are you gonna
finish them?

25:27.827 --> 25:29.128
- No, tonight.
- Tonight?

25:29.161 --> 25:30.229
- Mm-hmm.
- Hurry up.

25:30.262 --> 25:31.130
- I don't want to interrupt.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.099
I just had to some say hi.
- Sit down.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.101
- You were so emotional,
Schwartzy.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.869
- I'm being very sentimental
in my old age.

25:36.903 --> 25:39.872
- That's okay.
Old age? What are you?

25:39.906 --> 25:42.842
- I'm going on 34 now.
- Oh, God.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.677
- What are you, 39?

25:44.711 --> 25:47.647
- Yeah, I wish.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.215
You know, actually,
I don't wish, really.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.950
- No.
- I don't wish because

25:50.983 --> 25:54.687
I look at, you know, my life,
and what I've experienced,

25:54.721 --> 25:55.922
and think--
- Yeah.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.289
- I wouldn't change
a thing, really.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.258
Some of it's been tough,
as it will be for you.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.027
both: Yeah.
- You know, you're gonna have

26:01.060 --> 26:02.094
things that come at you.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.195
That's what life is.
- I know.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.931
- It's checkered with problems.

26:04.964 --> 26:08.801
- Talking to Lisa,
who's been married 34 years,

26:08.835 --> 26:11.904
I mean, she knows
what she's talking about.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.173
The advice that she has is
advice that we should take,

26:14.206 --> 26:16.175
and the words that she have
are words that we should

26:16.208 --> 26:18.911
listen to and live by,
and it's--

26:18.945 --> 26:20.279
they're not to be taken lightly.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.248
- Just, you know, hold tight.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.916
*

26:23.950 --> 26:25.718
- I'll be there for you.
- But there's many good things

26:25.752 --> 26:27.754
that will counteract
that, you know?

26:27.787 --> 26:29.255
- You should just keep--
- I'm so happy that you

26:29.288 --> 26:30.256
agreed to do it, by the way.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.691
I don't want to get over-sappy,

26:31.724 --> 26:32.759
but it means a lot.
It means a lot.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.227
- I love you both.
- We've built a new foundation--

26:35.261 --> 26:36.829
wait, that's part of my vows!

26:36.863 --> 26:38.698
There's no doubt in my mind

26:38.731 --> 26:40.733
that Katie is the one
I want to marry.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.301
I want to spend the rest
of my life with her.

26:42.334 --> 26:45.237
She makes me happy,
and she fulfills me.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.939
- Are you leaving?
- I got to get out.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.941
Let's say good-bye.
- [groans]

26:48.975 --> 26:51.210
- I know we have our issues
to work on.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.946
But those are minor issues and
we're gonna work through them.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.915
- I love you.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.884
- Love you. I'm gonna see you
in the morning.

26:57.917 --> 27:00.019
Are you leaving too, Mama?
- Love you.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.755
- Regardless of what's happened
over the last year and a half,

27:02.789 --> 27:05.324
I can feel it--
the love is there.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.827
I can't wait
to get married tomorrow.

27:07.860 --> 27:11.230
- Bye, you. Bye. Mwah!

27:11.263 --> 27:12.932
- You're always--
- Don't stay up too late.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.767
- Last night as a single lady.

27:14.801 --> 27:15.902
- Exactly.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.137
*

27:18.170 --> 27:19.238
Coming up...

27:19.271 --> 27:22.008
I haven't used an iron
since 1986.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.843
- This I have got to see.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.311
- Things are not going well
for me right now,

27:25.344 --> 27:28.014
so you can bugger off.

27:30.717 --> 27:33.452
[hip-hop music]

27:33.485 --> 27:38.691
*

27:38.725 --> 27:40.860
- Hi. Good morning.

27:40.893 --> 27:43.462
It smells so good.
Happy wedding day.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.231
- Yay!

27:45.264 --> 27:47.433
- It's weird when you've known
people for a really long time

27:47.466 --> 27:49.836
and you've thought about
them getting married,

27:49.869 --> 27:52.338
and then when
it's actually there,

27:52.371 --> 27:53.806
you can't describe
that feeling.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.375
I could not feel more proud.

27:56.408 --> 27:57.944
My brain's still
not working yet.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.312
I feel, like, really--
I feel like I'm high.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.714
You know, like, when you get,
like, in your head,

28:01.748 --> 28:03.850
until you're paranoid?
[laughter]

28:03.883 --> 28:05.351
- You guys use these before?

28:05.384 --> 28:06.318
- We just went deep-sea fishing.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.287
Actually, these are the ones
you just flip.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.256
- Schwartz already knows
how to handle a long rod.

28:10.289 --> 28:11.357
[laughter]

28:11.390 --> 28:14.293
- I'm ready to rock and roll.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.495
- So this is the last time
that Schwartz is ever

28:16.528 --> 28:19.465
gonna be a single man fishing.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.033
Tom said there's
trouser snakes here.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.369
Is that true?
- Yeah, there's trouser snakes.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.504
[Australian accent] Big ol' long
trouser snakes.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.973
- If it were me
getting married,

28:27.006 --> 28:28.340
I don't think I'd be fishing.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.909
I mean, I'd probably be playing,
you know,

28:29.942 --> 28:31.410
a nice game of golf.
Ah!

28:31.443 --> 28:32.945
Or Russian Roulette.

28:32.979 --> 28:36.048
Oh, f--- you, you f---ing rock.

28:36.082 --> 28:38.851
- How do you feel today?
You excited? Are you nervous?

28:38.885 --> 28:40.787
- I'm not ready with the vows.
That's the only thing.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.121
I still haven't--
- You don't have your vows done?

28:42.154 --> 28:43.956
- No, I--I'm gonna do 'em.
I'm gonna do 'em.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.391
- You're "I'm gonna do 'em."

28:45.424 --> 28:47.126
- [sighs]
- Oh, God.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.862
I can only imagine it's gonna be
a lot of hair tugging

28:49.896 --> 28:53.532
and a lot of, "Well, Bubby,
well, you know, Bubby,"

28:53.565 --> 28:55.835
It would be painful.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.004
He cannot wing the vows.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.138
- I have to write 'em down,
cause I can't

28:59.171 --> 29:00.306
read it from my phone.

29:00.339 --> 29:01.340
That would look horrible, right?

29:01.373 --> 29:02.408
- No, you need to write it
on a nice piece of paper

29:02.441 --> 29:04.543
with nice handwriting.
- Wait, nice handwriting?

29:04.576 --> 29:07.346
It's like chicken scratch.
- Dude.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.149
- What are you doing?

29:10.182 --> 29:11.450
- I'm ironing my dress.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.385
- This I have got to see.

29:13.419 --> 29:16.122
- I haven't used an iron
since 1986.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.424
- [laughs]
Let's have a look.

29:18.457 --> 29:19.959
- I used to do it.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.427
- I've got to get
a picture of this.

29:21.460 --> 29:24.463
- Can sort of see it
when I need to...

29:24.496 --> 29:26.565
Bloody hell.
- [laughing]

29:26.598 --> 29:28.801
- Shut up, will you--
- Will you do my suit afterward?

29:28.835 --> 29:30.870
- Everybody always says,
"How do you manage

29:30.903 --> 29:33.039
to achieve so much
and do so much?"

29:33.072 --> 29:35.074
I don't do things like this

29:35.107 --> 29:37.343
because luckily, I have somebody
to help me out.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.046
Look, I've got a beige bathrobe
on and I'm ironing, okay?

29:40.079 --> 29:41.848
Things are not going well
for me right now,

29:41.881 --> 29:43.916
so you can bugger off and get
out of my face.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.585
Will you go away?
Why--stop taking the piss.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.588
[upbeat music]

29:49.621 --> 29:53.926
*

29:53.960 --> 29:55.461
- Have you finished your speech?
- Yeah.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.063
I just went over it again
in my head.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.598
I'm not gonna, like, practice it
like an actual speech,

29:59.631 --> 30:01.067
'cause I'm better at improv.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.401
- That's how I feel
about my vows,

30:02.434 --> 30:03.602
but I don't think
it's a good idea.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.071
- I don't think that's
a good idea, Katie.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.372
Not for your vows.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.140
- You're, like, so calm.
I don't know how.

30:08.174 --> 30:09.508
I'd be, like,
freaking out, I think.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.943
- What is there
to freak out about?

30:10.977 --> 30:12.478
- I don't know.
That's just my personality.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.546
I freaked out just going
to the passport office.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.082
[laughter]

30:16.115 --> 30:17.850
You're just calm as can be.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.185
- From what I've been hearing
from everyone else

30:19.218 --> 30:21.921
is that your wedding day
will just fly by,

30:21.954 --> 30:24.123
so I have worked very hard
to make sure

30:24.156 --> 30:27.026
everything was taken care of
before my wedding day,

30:27.059 --> 30:29.161
so that way, I can just relax,

30:29.195 --> 30:31.931
and have fun, and enjoy
every second of it.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.099
- Katie.
- Yeah?

30:33.132 --> 30:34.200
- So we're good on timing?

30:34.233 --> 30:35.467
You have pictures at 4:00?

30:35.501 --> 30:36.468
- Yeah.
- Okay.

30:36.502 --> 30:37.736
Do you want--need a drink?
Do you want food?

30:37.769 --> 30:40.973
I plan on helping Katie with
whatever she needs.

30:41.007 --> 30:43.109
And whatever she doesn't
know that she needs.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.878
You need me to find something?
Is your phone charged?

30:45.912 --> 30:48.547
Whether that means last-minute
organization for the wedding...

30:48.580 --> 30:50.549
Your mom is coming in a minute.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.885
Whether that means
"We need more alcohol,

30:52.919 --> 30:54.553
and someone has to drive
to go get it."

30:54.586 --> 30:56.889
- Five more handles of Tito's.

30:56.923 --> 30:58.190
- Five more.
- Five more.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.992
- We have to finish
making your bouquet.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.560
- Trisha has it.
- I'll go find her.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.662
That's why I call myself
the maid of honor.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.097
You need anything else?

31:05.131 --> 31:06.132
- I do need to finish my vows.

31:06.165 --> 31:07.466
[laughs] Oops.

31:07.499 --> 31:08.467
*

31:08.500 --> 31:09.969
- You guys all showered up?

31:10.002 --> 31:11.603
You're gonna look at me and say,
swear to God,

31:11.637 --> 31:13.172
you guys all took showers,
right?

31:13.205 --> 31:14.673
- Yeah.
- Okay.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.542
- Dude, Jax is making
your brothers f---ing say

31:16.575 --> 31:18.577
swear to God
they took a shower.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.446
Such a f---ing asshole.

31:20.479 --> 31:21.914
- Where's your suit?
- They're all upstairs, Jax.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.182
Sandoval has 'em.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.084
- Schwartz has a lot going on
right now with his wedding day,

31:25.117 --> 31:26.385
so, I mean, the least
of his problems

31:26.418 --> 31:29.021
is getting his brothers ready.
First of all, what--

31:29.055 --> 31:30.957
why do I have to dress
a 30-year-old man?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.591
Three of 'em.
Are those clean socks,

31:32.624 --> 31:33.659
or ones from yesterday?
Be honest.

31:33.692 --> 31:36.562
- These are from yesterday.
- Yeah. Clean socks.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.197
All you guys, give me your ties.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.699
We're gonna re-knot 'em.
Those knots are creased.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.501
- Bert, he doesn't have
the tie with him?

31:42.534 --> 31:44.570
- I didn't get mine.
- We're missing one.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.138
- I have to go get it.
- You got to go get it.

31:46.172 --> 31:47.306
- So I have to walk all the way
to go get it?

31:47.339 --> 31:49.976
- You sure do.
I just want to make sure,

31:50.009 --> 31:51.143
you know, Tommy's happy.

31:51.177 --> 31:52.578
- [chuckles]

31:52.611 --> 31:54.213
- It's beautiful.
- Hey, Mama.

31:54.246 --> 31:57.049
- Oh!
- Aw.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.117
- I have a little
something for you.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.151
I want to give it to you
real quick.

31:59.185 --> 32:01.553
- Okay. Thank you.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.323
- It's got, like,
a little, like, ring box,

32:04.356 --> 32:08.227
that says,
"Listen to the messages

32:08.260 --> 32:10.196
your heart is sending."

32:10.229 --> 32:12.264
- I've always told Katie that
since she was a little girl.

32:12.298 --> 32:15.201
When she'd, you know,
have troubles and stuff,

32:15.234 --> 32:16.568
just listen to your heart.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.504
Always listen to what
your heart tells you.

32:18.537 --> 32:19.638
- Cannot do this right now!

32:19.671 --> 32:24.510
Like, what? Like, I can't--
I'm not, like, not yet.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.178
- Hey, it's becoming
near the witching hour, man.

32:26.212 --> 32:27.746
If you're gonna back out,
do it now.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.615
- How's that? Like that?
- Love it, dude.

32:29.648 --> 32:30.682
- Why do you got your dress
pants on already?

32:30.716 --> 32:32.351
- Dude, I'm getting ready.
- Where's your shower?

32:32.384 --> 32:34.320
- I just need
to rinse my face off.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.989
Today's my day, you know, and
I want to be looking sharp.

32:37.023 --> 32:38.357
I want everything to be perfect.

32:38.390 --> 32:41.227
I don't need a shower.
Just throw on some deodorant.

32:41.260 --> 32:44.530
The old Irish shower.

32:44.563 --> 32:47.366
Ah!

32:47.399 --> 32:49.635
Wait, is that offensive?

32:49.668 --> 32:51.637
- Dude, these ties are actually
kind of hard to tie.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.239
'Cause these are so stiff!

32:53.272 --> 32:57.143
- Just like my boner.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.645
Tom's kind of like the--
the male makeover MacGyver.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.780
He didn't just bring his suit,
he brought...

33:01.813 --> 33:03.382
- Sandoval, you have
an extra tie, right?

33:03.415 --> 33:05.284
- Backup ties...
- I have like three ties.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.552
You can...
both: Borrow.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.120
- I have no idea
where my cuff links are.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.788
- I have extras.
- Backup cuff links...

33:09.821 --> 33:11.623
- Well, dude, do you know,
I have a dress shirt

33:11.657 --> 33:13.259
that has French cuffs
that's really nice.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.626
- Yeah.
- Backup shirts...

33:14.660 --> 33:16.262
- I have a level 32 hair spray.

33:16.295 --> 33:17.663
It's the strongest
on the market.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.365
- [laughs]
- He always has something

33:19.398 --> 33:21.233
that can just make your outfit
that much better.

33:21.267 --> 33:22.701
- Are these too raggedy?

33:22.734 --> 33:24.370
- Dude, no. I got socks.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.638
- [sighs] Dude, what would
I f---ing do without you?

33:26.672 --> 33:28.374
I need--I'm gonna need
20 minutes

33:28.407 --> 33:30.276
to go write down my vows.
- Schwartz!

33:30.309 --> 33:31.643
- I feel like we don't
have enough time.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.646
- Go chill, dude--
- Write your f---ing vows.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.814
- Clear your head, man.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.249
You believe this is
finally happening?

33:37.283 --> 33:38.684
- I know.
- It's finally here.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.819
Two weeks ago,
wasn't looking good.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.721
[laughs]
- Really wasn't.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.723
- What'd she do to you?
- She sat me down and said,

33:44.756 --> 33:46.158
"I bet you f---ed
that girl in Vegas."

33:46.192 --> 33:47.626
- Yeah, well, you did, so...

33:47.659 --> 33:49.828
- Yeah, and you're also a bitch.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.630
- Was not.
- I mean, if you're still

33:51.663 --> 33:53.632
together after all that,
then you should probably

33:53.665 --> 33:55.601
be together for the rest
of your life.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.136
- You're right.
- You know what I'm saying?

33:57.169 --> 33:58.804
- They're stuck together.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.172
- Coming up...

34:00.206 --> 34:02.641
- Everybody ready?

34:02.674 --> 34:03.642
- Guys...

34:03.675 --> 34:06.678
[all screaming]

34:11.317 --> 34:14.086
[hip-hop music]

34:14.120 --> 34:17.756
*

34:17.789 --> 34:19.758
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.393
- Hello.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.629
This is charming.
I see Katie's vision.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.697
It's kind of woodsy,
it's rustic.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.699
I think the next time
I get married,

34:27.733 --> 34:29.468
I'm gonna do it
somewhere like this.

34:29.501 --> 34:32.438
It's still elegant, but it's
a little kind of Bohemian.

34:32.471 --> 34:33.872
Look how sweet.

34:33.905 --> 34:37.376
It truly is lovely.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.777
Dearly beloved,

34:38.810 --> 34:40.879
we are gathered here today...

34:40.912 --> 34:42.013
Oh, no "Dearly beloved."

34:42.047 --> 34:44.483
I'm actually kind of feeling
more nervous

34:44.516 --> 34:46.518
because it's
somebody else's day,

34:46.552 --> 34:48.520
and if I screw it up,
I screw it up for them,

34:48.554 --> 34:50.822
and I don't want that to be
a remote possibility.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.524
I have to get it right.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.793
Do you think we could
cover this in fabric?

34:54.826 --> 34:56.895
Or do you have any extra fabric?
- Yeah, is that okay? To cover?

34:56.928 --> 34:58.297
The front of it?
- I think so.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.331
Why don't you do that.

34:59.365 --> 35:00.499
- This is not your restaurant.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.668
- So funny, because with Katie,

35:02.701 --> 35:04.670
said "What color are your
bridesmaid

35:04.703 --> 35:05.871
dresses gonna be?"
And she says,

35:05.904 --> 35:07.673
"I thought I'd have them
in dual tones,"

35:07.706 --> 35:10.376
so I said,
"What about, like, silver?"

35:10.409 --> 35:12.478
"Good idea," she said.
"What about white flowers?"

35:12.511 --> 35:14.680
"Good idea."
She just is so easygoing,

35:14.713 --> 35:17.616
she's just, "Yeah, that's
lovely, I love that."

35:17.649 --> 35:19.518
Can you imagine me?
I would be like,

35:19.551 --> 35:20.852
pain in everybody's ass.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.822
Oh, right, is that going there?

35:23.855 --> 35:26.158
- I think some white fabric
at the front

35:26.192 --> 35:27.726
will make it look much prettier.

35:27.759 --> 35:34.800
*

35:36.902 --> 35:38.504
- Ooh. F---.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.739
Oh, sh--, a f---ing bee?

35:40.772 --> 35:44.343
[grunts] That thing's gonna
drive me crazy.

35:44.376 --> 35:47.379
I f---ing got to write sh--!

35:47.413 --> 35:48.714
I know it's coming
down to the wire.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.516
I haven't written my vows.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.851
Just picked the wrong time
in the wrong room, dude.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.753
But I'm a master procrastinator.

35:54.786 --> 35:57.423
Sh--, now my pen.

35:57.456 --> 35:57.556
I got this.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.861
Alright, Whoo.

36:02.894 --> 36:06.198
*

36:06.232 --> 36:07.433
- She just wrapped it in lace.

36:07.466 --> 36:08.534
We can kind of
secure it a little,

36:08.567 --> 36:09.735
or if you want us to add
anything to it--

36:09.768 --> 36:10.602
- It's so good.
- Let's see.

36:10.636 --> 36:12.471
So it's, like,
wood from the grounds.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.606
Like, the groundskeeper
cut wood.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.542
- No way!
- Yeah.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.710
- This is gorgeous.
It's so original.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.479
- She has your tossing bouquet.
- I made it.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.682
- You did make it.
- Today is...

36:23.715 --> 36:26.652
without a doubt, the most
happiest day of my life.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.420
Everything is perfect.

36:28.454 --> 36:29.621
Ah!

36:29.655 --> 36:30.856
Almost.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.591
Ow!

36:32.624 --> 36:34.993
- Deal with it!
- Ow!

36:35.026 --> 36:37.529
I feel just a sharp pinch,

36:37.563 --> 36:40.899
like something jabbing
into my side.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.734
- Let's try this right now.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.436
Do you have to do it
on both sides?

36:44.470 --> 36:45.837
both: Yeah.
- They told me

36:45.871 --> 36:48.240
at the last fitting they were
gonna put boning in,

36:48.274 --> 36:49.841
but this is painful.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.543
- It's okay, weddings
are always late.

36:51.577 --> 36:52.811
- Yeah, totally normal.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.846
- You want to sit?
- Yeah. Okay.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.882
Maybe tacos and margaritas

36:56.915 --> 36:58.917
the night before you're
supposed to slip into

36:58.950 --> 37:01.853
a form-fitting wedding dress
is not the best idea.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.423
- So this is the part
that can't be broken.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.024
- Okay.
- If that seam f---s up,

37:06.057 --> 37:07.659
then we're f---ed,
'cause then the--

37:07.693 --> 37:09.795
the dress rips apart.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.463
- Look at your hair.
It looks great.

37:11.497 --> 37:13.899
- See the back?
- Whoa!

37:13.932 --> 37:16.001
- I need to fix--
the curls are falling,

37:16.034 --> 37:17.803
and it makes my head
look bald.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.806
You know, I've been a bridesmaid
a lot of times,

37:20.839 --> 37:24.042
and I'm in a dress,
I'm kind of uncomfortable.

37:24.075 --> 37:27.813
But like, having a suit, that
means I'm wearing pants.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.516
I can eat whatever
the hell I want.

37:30.549 --> 37:32.884
- Dude, this shirt
is so nice, man.

37:32.918 --> 37:33.985
- I know, it's f---ed.
- Do you know why

37:34.019 --> 37:35.621
it's so--don't do that.

37:35.654 --> 37:37.556
You know, Schwartz is
my best friend.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.692
I love him like a brother,

37:40.726 --> 37:43.295
and being here today,
being a part of

37:43.329 --> 37:45.297
this beautiful
wedding...[sighs].

37:45.331 --> 37:48.300
There's so much--there's so much
love in the air.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.469
- You look amazing.
- Dude. Guys. Thanks for--

37:50.502 --> 37:51.770
- Good luck out there.
- Seriously--

37:51.803 --> 37:53.472
- Thanks for your help
with my brothers.

37:53.505 --> 37:54.773
- You look the best.
- You saved my ass.

37:54.806 --> 37:55.907
- You look--
- It's a big day.

37:55.941 --> 37:56.942
You ready?
- I feel sexy. Really?

37:56.975 --> 38:00.512
- This is it.
Last stop, Tom.

38:00.546 --> 38:02.648
One vagina for the rest
of your life.

38:02.681 --> 38:03.982
But all joking aside,

38:04.015 --> 38:06.885
to finally be at this moment,
I'm just really excited.

38:06.918 --> 38:09.555
I'm really glad everything
came together,

38:09.588 --> 38:10.622
and they're getting married.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.724
- Did you bring a funnel?
I'll funnel a beer later.

38:12.758 --> 38:13.692
- All right, by the way,
you do--

38:13.725 --> 38:15.327
you do look the best
I've ever seen you, man.

38:15.361 --> 38:16.762
- Thank you, man.
I appreciate that.

38:16.795 --> 38:17.663
- You want a shot or something?
You okay?

38:17.696 --> 38:19.665
- No, I'm good on booze.
All right, dudes.

38:19.698 --> 38:20.866
Love you guys.
- Love you too, man.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.601
- Love you boys. See you guys.
- See you in a little bit.

38:22.634 --> 38:23.735
- All right.
- We'll cry a lot.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.003
- Amazing.
- We'll see you.

38:25.036 --> 38:27.005
- See you guys.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.674
I don't need to have
the rings yet, do I?

38:28.707 --> 38:31.877
Who should I ask about that?

38:31.910 --> 38:34.112
[dramatic music]

38:34.145 --> 38:35.747
- Oh, yeah.
- [laughs]

38:35.781 --> 38:38.350
- Stassi, you're like--
I feel like it's a moment.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.786
*

38:40.819 --> 38:42.120
- Do it?
- Yeah.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.889
- Everybody ready?

38:43.922 --> 38:47.526
*

38:47.559 --> 38:48.827
- You guys?
- [gasping]

38:48.860 --> 38:51.697
[all screaming]

38:51.730 --> 38:54.866
- Yay!
You looks gorgeous!

38:54.900 --> 38:58.103
- Goddess!
- How does it feel?

38:58.136 --> 39:00.639
- Katie looks so beautiful
in her dress.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.073
It brings back memories for me.

39:02.107 --> 39:05.644
I'm so excited to have her be
a part of the wives' club

39:05.677 --> 39:07.078
because as of right now,
in our group,

39:07.112 --> 39:09.881
there's only one member,
and that's me.

39:09.915 --> 39:11.783
- Okay, who's gonna catch
the bouquet tonight?

39:11.817 --> 39:13.552
Not that one.
- Stassi!

39:13.585 --> 39:15.921
- All your dreams are coming
true today, Katie.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.789
*

39:17.823 --> 39:20.091
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, Mom.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.660
- Coming up...

39:21.693 --> 39:23.762
- All right, Katie.
I'm lining everyone up.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.631
Hey, Tom, we're ready.
- Oh, my God.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.766
- Let's do this.
- Oh, my gosh.

39:27.799 --> 39:30.035
- Here we go.
- Daddy.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.408
- You guys have 15 minutes.

39:36.442 --> 39:37.809
- 15 minutes till ceremony?

39:37.843 --> 39:41.112
- * I'm gonna fall apart

39:41.146 --> 39:45.451
* I can't remember
anything before *

39:45.484 --> 39:49.087
* I'm shooting in the dark

39:49.120 --> 39:52.558
* I'm crashing through another
stained glass door *

39:52.591 --> 39:53.759
* Everywhere I step
I'm always *

39:53.792 --> 39:55.727
- You okay? How are you feeling?
- Good.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.128
- Yeah.
- I've been great.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.764
- Very relaxed.
- Yeah.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.466
- * And when it rains,
it pours *

40:00.499 --> 40:02.634
* And drowns my dreams

40:02.668 --> 40:04.570
* So just sit back and watch

40:04.603 --> 40:06.705
- Dad, what's up?
Hey, oh, my God.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.607
I'm in the wedding-day
whirlwind.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.542
It's like, the only thing
that's missing is you.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.744
Ah, f---, my head--I can't even
think straight, Dad.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.746
Anyways, the important thing is
I love you so much,

40:14.780 --> 40:16.748
and I miss the sh-- out of you,
and I can't wait to come home.

40:16.782 --> 40:19.084
Okay. All right. Bye, Dad.
All right, I love you.

40:19.117 --> 40:22.788
- * Even though my feet

40:22.821 --> 40:24.690
- Why don't you shake
your dress out, sweetie?

40:24.723 --> 40:25.757
- Oh, yeah.
- Walking through

40:25.791 --> 40:27.225
the dirt trails, yeah.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.894
- Okay, Tom, we're ready.
- Oh, my God.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.162
- Let's do this.
- I got some pep in my step.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.698
- Dirt went inside
my dress a little bit.

40:32.731 --> 40:34.700
- How'd it get inside there?
- You won't even notice

40:34.733 --> 40:36.468
when you're walking.
- Kristin.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.169
- Yes?
- You're remarkably helpful.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.071
- Have you got any in your
drawers, darling?

40:40.105 --> 40:42.574
- No, thank God.

40:42.608 --> 40:43.842
- Man.
- Right here?

40:43.875 --> 40:45.844
- Got to give us
full VIP status?

40:45.877 --> 40:48.213
- All right, Katie.
I'm lining everyone up.

40:48.246 --> 40:49.214
- There are no words.

40:49.247 --> 40:51.817
Being in the woods,
in my dress,

40:51.850 --> 40:54.119
with all of our friends
and family,

40:54.152 --> 40:55.654
about to walk down the aisle
and marry Tom.

40:55.687 --> 40:58.189
There are no words.

40:58.223 --> 41:02.928
- * Even though my feet

41:02.961 --> 41:04.730
- I know how
to pull off a suit.

41:04.763 --> 41:07.098
But damn, Ariana looks good.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.535
- * Without an end in sight

41:09.568 --> 41:11.503
- I think she might have
wore it better.

41:11.537 --> 41:13.204
- * It'll be all right

41:13.238 --> 41:15.206
* It'll be all right

41:15.240 --> 41:18.143
- Oh.
- Oh, my gosh.

41:18.176 --> 41:20.846
- Here we go.
- Daddy.

41:20.879 --> 41:23.214
- * It'll be all right

41:23.248 --> 41:26.217
*

41:26.251 --> 41:27.653
- Speechless.

41:27.686 --> 41:29.220
*

41:29.254 --> 41:31.523
- * It'll be all

41:31.557 --> 41:32.958
*

41:32.991 --> 41:34.560
- Schwartz.

41:34.593 --> 41:35.661
- You're gonna make me cry.

41:35.694 --> 41:37.829
- Oh, let's try
not cry just yet.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.298
*

41:40.331 --> 41:42.601
- You look good.
- You look good too, man.

41:42.634 --> 41:48.607
*

41:48.640 --> 41:50.308
- Oh, puppies.

41:50.341 --> 41:51.743
Please stand.

41:51.777 --> 41:58.249
*

41:58.283 --> 42:00.619
- I just want to slow it down
and pause it,

42:00.652 --> 42:04.322
and just savor the moment,
'cause it's absolutely perfect.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.857
*

42:05.891 --> 42:08.994
- * It'll be all right

42:09.027 --> 42:10.929
- Next time,
on the season finale

42:10.962 --> 42:12.263
of "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:12.297 --> 42:14.733
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

42:14.766 --> 42:17.936
[all cheering]

42:17.969 --> 42:20.338
[upbeat music]

42:20.371 --> 42:22.240
- When do you think
you'll have a baby?

42:22.273 --> 42:23.609
- Oh, my God.

42:23.642 --> 42:25.877
[all screaming]

42:25.911 --> 42:27.746
- We've taken on
another premises.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.915
A bar always needs a face.

42:29.948 --> 42:31.750
- What?

42:31.783 --> 42:33.218
- Want to get married
at some point?

42:33.251 --> 42:35.020
- Oh, my God.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.756
- There's a lot of things that
I found out recently

42:37.789 --> 42:38.790
about Shay.

42:38.824 --> 42:41.627
- Listen, you're young enough
to start again.

42:41.660 --> 42:44.029
- The way you treat me,
how a lot of people treat me--

42:44.062 --> 42:46.297
- By taking care of you?
- How, financially?

42:46.331 --> 42:47.298
'Cause that's about it.

42:47.332 --> 42:50.268
- So you're not on drugs?

42:50.301 --> 42:54.640
Divorces aren't easy,
but it has to be that way.

42:54.673 --> 42:55.907
