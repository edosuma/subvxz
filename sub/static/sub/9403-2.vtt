00:01.720 --> 00:03.255
<i>I had a fire at the diner.</i>

00:03.256 --> 00:04.490
<i>I lost everything.</i>

00:04.557 --> 00:08.811
Please, Haley.
I just need a little help.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.095
It's just
for a night or two.

00:10.180 --> 00:11.680
You're gonna have to make
other arrangements.

00:11.731 --> 00:13.548
Of course.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.517
Clay, I'm worried.
A lot of people sleepwalk.

00:15.568 --> 00:17.069
They don't get dressed,
grab their phone,

00:17.153 --> 00:18.487
and go sleep in a park.

00:18.554 --> 00:19.938
I'm gonna go meet
the guy

00:20.023 --> 00:21.223
that's gonna run
red bedroom.

00:21.274 --> 00:23.409
Well, well.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.495
Well, I've called
the golf courses, the bars,

00:26.562 --> 00:27.696
and the strip clubs.

00:27.747 --> 00:29.114
I don't think
your father's in town.

00:29.199 --> 00:30.582
Daddy!

00:34.988 --> 00:37.339
You're worried
about the sound stage.

00:37.407 --> 00:40.125
The movie that was going
to rent our stage

00:40.210 --> 00:41.877
fell through.

00:41.928 --> 00:43.879
It's gonna work out,
right?

00:43.930 --> 00:45.597
It's gonna work out.

00:45.682 --> 00:47.582

Julian, wake up.

01:11.908 --> 01:13.325
What's wrong, baby?

01:13.393 --> 01:14.493
Nothing.

01:14.577 --> 01:16.278
That's good.

01:16.329 --> 01:17.496
Not good.

01:17.580 --> 01:19.631
The babies.

01:19.716 --> 01:21.216
What about them?

01:21.284 --> 01:23.952
They're not crying,
and we're sleeping.

01:24.020 --> 01:26.839
♪ Wait for sunrise

Aah! Ooh!

01:31.644 --> 01:34.463
Good morning!

01:34.514 --> 01:35.764
Mom?

01:35.815 --> 01:37.632
I must be dreaming.
Quick, slap me.

When did
you get in?

01:45.492 --> 01:46.492
<i>How</i> did
you get in?

01:46.576 --> 01:48.610
The key

01:48.661 --> 01:51.196
Does everybody know about
the key under the lawn gnome?

01:51.281 --> 01:53.248
Apparently, yes.
Are the boys okay?

01:53.316 --> 01:54.450
Of course they're okay.

01:54.501 --> 01:55.817
I've done this before,
you know.

01:55.869 --> 01:56.485
Barely.

01:58.621 --> 02:01.423
There's coffee
and pastries,

02:01.491 --> 02:04.176
and you don't see your father
doing things like this.

02:04.260 --> 02:05.677
Dad.

02:05.762 --> 02:07.629
I told him I'd meet him
for breakfast.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.214
But we have
breakfast here.

02:09.299 --> 02:10.664
But we have business
to discuss.

02:10.717 --> 02:13.435
What business?

02:13.503 --> 02:16.388
Oh, my God.
I love coffee cake.

02:16.473 --> 02:19.441
He's gonna help me

02:19.509 --> 02:22.394
Quiet babies, coffee cake...
amazing!

02:22.479 --> 02:25.013
But we were gonna do
the clothing line together.

02:25.064 --> 02:27.616
Yes, mother.
We <i>were</i> until you said no.

02:27.683 --> 02:29.234
Daddy said yes.

02:30.737 --> 02:32.788
This is so good,
Victoria.

02:32.855 --> 02:34.022
This is not good,
hales.

02:34.073 --> 02:36.742
I-I come home to find
my father holding Lydia.

02:36.826 --> 02:37.993
I know.

02:38.044 --> 02:39.878
But he said
his diner burned down,

02:39.963 --> 02:41.380
and we were
standing in a church.

02:41.464 --> 02:43.465
What was I supposed to do?
Give him money.

02:43.533 --> 02:45.300
I offered him money.
He said he didn't want our money.

02:45.368 --> 02:46.885
He needed a place to stay
for a little while.

02:46.970 --> 02:48.637
Honey, I would love
to have talked to you

02:48.704 --> 02:49.755
before I made
this decision.

02:49.839 --> 02:50.923
But I couldn't.

02:51.007 --> 02:52.207
What do you want me
to say?

02:52.258 --> 02:53.892
I'm... I'm sorry.

02:53.977 --> 02:55.144
I'm really sorry.

02:55.211 --> 02:58.814
Don't... don't be sorry.

02:58.881 --> 03:01.150
One of the things I love
about you is how caring you are.

03:01.217 --> 03:03.852
It just... just caught me
by surprise.

03:06.523 --> 03:08.323
I suppose
Jamie's thrilled.

03:08.391 --> 03:10.392
Yeah, he is.

03:10.443 --> 03:13.779
You know, I did tell Dan
that if you said he has to go,

03:13.863 --> 03:14.947
he has to go.

03:16.899 --> 03:21.203
So...What do you think?

03:21.254 --> 03:23.255
You have to go.

03:24.958 --> 03:26.542
Get dressed.

03:40.523 --> 03:42.808
Sorry, sweetness.

03:55.271 --> 03:57.956
You sure you want to re-record
these guitar parts?

03:58.024 --> 04:00.092
Because once people find out
Chris Keller

04:00.159 --> 04:01.126
played on your track...

04:01.211 --> 04:02.444
I'm just saying.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.631
What happened to you,
anyway?

04:05.715 --> 04:07.950
My therapist said
I wasn't held enough as a child.

04:08.017 --> 04:10.219
Clearly, but that's not
what I'm talking about.

04:10.286 --> 04:11.420
What happened to you
as an artist?

04:11.471 --> 04:12.554
What are you
talking about?

04:12.622 --> 04:13.839
I had a song all over TV
last year.

04:13.923 --> 04:15.123
What song?

04:18.394 --> 04:21.647
♪ Toaster pastry, you look
so good and yummy ♪

04:21.731 --> 04:24.816
♪ toaster pastry,
get into my tummy ♪

04:24.901 --> 04:27.553
The toaster pastry song?
That was you?

04:27.620 --> 04:28.637
I thought
Quinn made that up.

04:28.688 --> 04:30.272
That song pays my rent.

04:30.323 --> 04:33.808
But you were
kind of a big deal.

04:33.860 --> 04:35.360
Whoa.

04:35.445 --> 04:36.962
Chris Keller's
still a big deal.

04:37.030 --> 04:39.915
I just...

04:39.982 --> 04:43.151
I just missed some opportunities
back then.

04:43.202 --> 04:44.653
Took some things
for granted.

04:46.322 --> 04:49.207
Sometimes I wish somebody
would have talked to me.

04:52.512 --> 04:54.162
Somebody's got to talk
to him.

04:54.213 --> 04:55.597
The ratings
are better than ever.

04:55.665 --> 04:56.882
They love
the cooking segments,

04:56.966 --> 04:58.467
his restaurant reviews.

04:58.518 --> 04:59.601
Jerry, come on.

04:59.669 --> 05:00.936
You cannot make this
about the show.

05:01.003 --> 05:02.337
We're talking
about his health.

05:02.388 --> 05:03.805
I've tried discussing it
with him,

05:03.856 --> 05:04.890
but I always
chicken out.

05:04.974 --> 05:06.108
And he's
getting worse.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.442
Okay. I'll do it.

05:07.510 --> 05:08.977
No, I'll do it.

05:09.028 --> 05:11.280
But if it goes poorly,
I need you to back me up.

05:11.347 --> 05:12.347
Of course.

05:12.398 --> 05:14.900
Besides,
we've both been there.

05:16.152 --> 05:17.869
Yeah.

05:20.356 --> 05:22.491
Marvin?

05:22.542 --> 05:23.659
Honey?

05:23.710 --> 05:25.994
I'm in here.

05:26.045 --> 05:27.963
Can I talk to you
for a second?

05:30.717 --> 05:32.367
Hi, baby.

05:32.418 --> 05:33.418
Hi.

05:34.804 --> 05:35.887
Mwah. Whoop.

05:35.972 --> 05:38.873
Got a little Mayo
on you there.

05:38.925 --> 05:40.208
So, what's up?

05:43.730 --> 05:45.597
Nothing.

05:52.772 --> 05:53.689
Clay.

05:55.942 --> 05:57.359
I'm okay.

05:57.410 --> 06:00.061
I was so worried.

06:00.113 --> 06:01.530
It's okay.

06:01.581 --> 06:04.416
I'm okay.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.285
I don't know
what's happening to me.

06:23.537 --> 06:25.255
Hey, Jamie.

06:25.322 --> 06:27.257
Uh, go get me the magazine
in the living room.

06:27.324 --> 06:29.592
Which one?

06:29.660 --> 06:30.960
Just the magazine
off the coffee table.

06:31.012 --> 06:32.178
Why?

06:32.263 --> 06:33.546
What?

06:33.631 --> 06:34.881
Why do you need it?

06:34.965 --> 06:36.716
Dude, just get me
the magazine.

06:36.801 --> 06:37.934
Okay. Fine.

Yeah.

06:48.312 --> 06:50.246
I missed you, boy.

06:50.314 --> 06:52.065
I missed you, too.

06:52.149 --> 06:53.400
Whoa. Where you going?

06:53.484 --> 06:54.651
I have to get this to mom.

06:54.702 --> 06:56.119
She has to have it
for some reason.

06:57.321 --> 06:59.289
Okay, Jamie.

06:59.356 --> 07:01.374
I was thinking you might want
to hang out with me today.

07:01.459 --> 07:02.525
Maybe we can go shoot
some hoops,

07:02.576 --> 07:03.543
go out to see Clay
or something.

07:03.627 --> 07:05.045
Okay.

07:05.129 --> 07:07.163
And, by the way, thanks

07:31.889 --> 07:34.657
Well, I don't know about that.

07:34.725 --> 07:36.493
So, grandpa, I thought
maybe one of these nights

07:36.560 --> 07:38.344
we could go camp out
in the backyard.

07:38.412 --> 07:39.863
I could set up my tent
and everything.

07:42.733 --> 07:45.919
Actually, Jamie,
I may be leaving tonight.

07:46.003 --> 07:47.587
Why?

07:47.705 --> 07:49.005
Well, the insurance people

07:49.072 --> 07:50.373
have arranged a place
for me to stay in town.

07:50.441 --> 07:53.343
But you have a place to stay
right here.

07:53.410 --> 07:55.311
They can't make you leave,
can they?

07:59.082 --> 08:01.918
I'm afraid they can.

08:07.274 --> 08:09.926
Mmm.

08:09.977 --> 08:11.528
This coffee cake
was really good.

08:11.595 --> 08:13.429
A fashion line
with her father.

08:13.481 --> 08:15.598
I'm sure she would love
to have you involved.

08:15.649 --> 08:18.034
I know he's doing this
on purpose.

08:18.101 --> 08:20.537
I can just see
that stupid, smug face of his

08:20.604 --> 08:22.872
smoking one
of those disgusting cigars

08:22.940 --> 08:25.041
and laughing
that despicable laugh.

08:25.109 --> 08:26.960
You guys really loved
each other.

08:27.044 --> 08:29.078
You watch it.

08:29.130 --> 08:31.080
How come when you thought I was
a threat to Brooke's happiness,

08:31.132 --> 08:33.549
you gave me this big talk
about being good to her

08:33.616 --> 08:35.083
and when Ted's
in the picture,

08:35.135 --> 08:37.220
you just sit there
with that ridiculous haircut,

08:37.287 --> 08:38.955
eating bacon
and cracking wise?

08:39.006 --> 08:40.807
What's wrong
with my haircut?

08:40.890 --> 08:42.342
How come he gets
a free pass?

08:42.426 --> 08:44.227
He doesn't get
a free pass.

08:44.294 --> 08:45.762
I just want Brooke
to be happy.

08:45.813 --> 08:47.630
And right now she's happy

08:47.681 --> 08:49.265
because her father's
back in her life.

08:49.316 --> 08:51.017
He's up to something.

08:51.101 --> 08:52.685
You'll see.

08:52.770 --> 08:53.987
Maybe he's not.

08:54.071 --> 08:55.939
Maybe it's
all in your head.

08:55.990 --> 08:57.640
You're saying
it's all in my head?

08:57.691 --> 08:59.442
Not definitively.

08:59.493 --> 09:01.578
But all your tests
look fine.

09:01.645 --> 09:04.330
Have you ever seen
a psychiatrist?

09:05.950 --> 09:08.334
So, you don't think there's
anything actually wrong with me?

09:08.419 --> 09:11.171
Clay, she's
just trying to help.

09:14.008 --> 09:16.793
A long time ago,
I saw a psychiatrist.

09:16.844 --> 09:18.461
Can I ask why?

09:18.512 --> 09:20.380
My wife passed away,

09:20.464 --> 09:22.799
and my doctor thought it would
help to talk to someone.

09:22.850 --> 09:24.166
And did it?

09:24.218 --> 09:25.685
No. Not really.

09:25.719 --> 09:27.770
You know,
that was a long time ago.

09:27.838 --> 09:29.522
I don't think
that's what's affecting me.

09:29.607 --> 09:31.391
I just need to sleep better.

09:31.475 --> 09:33.226
So isn't there
some kind of treatment

09:33.310 --> 09:34.561
or prescription
you can recommend?

09:34.628 --> 09:37.864
Why did you suggest
a psychiatrist, Dr. Hudson?

09:37.948 --> 09:40.016
Well, historically,
many sleep disorders

09:40.067 --> 09:43.019
are triggered
by something psychological.

09:43.070 --> 09:45.321
♪ The divided way you feel

09:45.372 --> 09:47.323
♪ not being multiplied by two

09:47.374 --> 09:48.958
why wouldn't you?
'Cause it's weird.

09:49.026 --> 09:50.960
It's not weird.
It might help.

09:51.028 --> 09:52.412
And it might not.

09:52.496 --> 09:55.248
Clay, if seeing a psychiatrist
is going to help you,

09:55.332 --> 09:56.833
then go see
a psychiatrist.

09:56.884 --> 09:58.501
Why are you being
so stubborn?

09:58.552 --> 10:00.220
How am I being stubborn?

10:00.304 --> 10:02.088
You didn't even want
to go to the doctor.

10:02.172 --> 10:03.423
You said you were fine.

10:03.507 --> 10:05.091
Then I wake up, and
you're nowhere to be found.

10:05.175 --> 10:07.927
And this isn't
getting better.

10:08.012 --> 10:09.846
Do you understand
what this feels like?

10:09.897 --> 10:10.980
How would you like to be
the one

10:11.048 --> 10:12.015
wandering around
the countryside?

10:12.066 --> 10:13.349
I wouldn't want to be.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.601
But if I was

10:14.685 --> 10:16.269
and seeing a psychiatrist
could stop it,

10:16.353 --> 10:17.487
then I would go
in a second.

10:19.323 --> 10:21.941
I think it's terrible
what's happening to you.

10:22.026 --> 10:24.410
But this is happening to me,
too.

10:24.495 --> 10:27.030
I feel so panicked
because you're out there

10:27.081 --> 10:28.414
and you're not yourself.

10:28.499 --> 10:30.166
And I'm worried that someone
is going to hurt you

10:30.233 --> 10:32.735
or something bad
is going to happen to you.

10:32.786 --> 10:34.587
I know.

10:34.672 --> 10:37.173
But just let me try
this new medication,

10:37.240 --> 10:38.541
and let's see
what happens.

10:38.592 --> 10:40.093
I have an agency to run.

10:40.177 --> 10:42.128
I have to go to Europe
now that Nate's back.

10:42.212 --> 10:43.713
I know
that this is <i>our</i> problem.

10:43.764 --> 10:45.247
It's not just mine.

10:45.299 --> 10:46.749
But I have a life to live.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.018
And what about tonight?

10:49.086 --> 10:50.720
What if it happens again?

10:50.771 --> 10:52.305
I don't know.
We'll handcuff me to the bed.

10:52.389 --> 10:53.422
Clay...
I'm serious.

10:53.474 --> 10:55.758
You know, why not?

10:55.809 --> 10:57.277
It might be fun.

11:05.819 --> 11:07.153
I couldn't do it.

11:07.237 --> 11:09.706
You didn't talk to him?
I didn't know how.

11:09.773 --> 11:11.491
It's not an easy subject
to just bring up.

11:11.575 --> 11:13.126
What's the problem?

11:13.210 --> 11:16.045
You just say, "I think you're
really plumping up there, jumbo."

11:16.113 --> 11:17.664
You better not say it
like that.

11:17.748 --> 11:19.582
<i>Me?</i>
<i>Yes. You.</i>

11:19.633 --> 11:20.967
Fine.
I will talk to him.

11:21.051 --> 11:22.802
Good.
Here he comes.

11:22.886 --> 11:24.286
Hey.
Hey, honey.

11:24.338 --> 11:25.221
What's up, Jerry?

11:27.808 --> 11:30.292
Have a good show.

11:31.812 --> 11:33.313
Thanks.

11:42.656 --> 11:45.658
So, who's that guy who told Alex
her song's no good?

11:45.743 --> 11:47.110
Crappy.

11:47.161 --> 11:48.811
He said it was crappy.

11:48.912 --> 11:51.313
His name's Chris Keller.

11:51.365 --> 11:52.281
Oh.

11:52.333 --> 11:53.366
I read about that guy.

11:53.450 --> 11:55.368
He dates a lot of girls.

11:55.452 --> 11:57.370
You should probably be
worried.

11:57.454 --> 11:58.955
Dude, shut up.

11:59.006 --> 12:01.541
Besides, things are great
with me and Alex.

12:03.794 --> 12:05.345
Too bad she doesn't have
a little sister

12:05.429 --> 12:06.429
so we could double date.

12:08.132 --> 12:11.134
How old is her mom, do you think?

12:11.185 --> 12:13.169
How would you like to go
on a little covert mission

12:13.220 --> 12:14.303
with me today?

12:14.355 --> 12:16.022
Cool.
Like what?

12:16.106 --> 12:17.557
Like steal Alex's room key

12:17.641 --> 12:19.675
from her purse
at red bedroom records

12:19.727 --> 12:21.728
and then move all her stuff
over here.

12:21.812 --> 12:23.696
Why?

12:23.781 --> 12:25.565
So she could move in.

12:25.649 --> 12:27.183
You're asking Alex
to move in?

12:27.234 --> 12:28.201
What about me?

12:28.285 --> 12:30.186
You have a house, Chuck.

12:30.237 --> 12:32.121
But still,
let <i>me</i> move in.

12:33.490 --> 12:36.042
Chuck, I'm asking Alex
to move in with me

12:36.126 --> 12:37.526
because she's
my girlfriend

12:37.578 --> 12:39.295
and because I love her.

12:39.362 --> 12:40.246
You do?

12:40.330 --> 12:41.831
Yeah. I do.

12:41.882 --> 12:43.166
Gross.

12:43.217 --> 12:44.467
Or cool.

12:45.502 --> 12:47.170
I don't know.

12:47.221 --> 12:48.421
So, what do you think?

12:48.505 --> 12:49.806
You want to help me?

12:49.873 --> 12:51.874
And mess with that creep
Chris Keller?

12:51.925 --> 12:53.375
Definitely.

12:53.427 --> 12:55.561
Attaboy. Let's go.

13:02.319 --> 13:04.386
Hi, daddy.
It's me again.

13:04.438 --> 13:06.689
I'm just wondering
where you are.

13:06.740 --> 13:08.324
Call me.

13:23.444 --> 13:25.162

about your love ♪

13:27.666 --> 13:29.250

13:33.054 --> 13:35.072
Is that Chris Keller?

13:35.140 --> 13:35.973
That's him.

13:38.143 --> 13:40.177
What a tool.

13:40.245 --> 13:42.646
I'm gonna Chuck that guy
right in the goods.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.166
Hey.

13:46.234 --> 13:48.686
Okay, here we go.

13:48.770 --> 13:50.854
You distract them,
and I'll get her key.

13:50.939 --> 13:52.656
And be cool.

13:52.741 --> 13:55.142
Hey! Chuck wanted to see
the studio again.

13:55.193 --> 13:56.277
You mind?

13:56.328 --> 13:58.579
Um, we're kind of busy
right now.

13:58.646 --> 13:59.747
Great.
He's coming in.

13:59.814 --> 14:02.316

the business.

14:05.670 --> 14:09.156

You know, so I could

14:29.527 --> 14:30.561
Yeah.

Sorry.

14:31.980 --> 14:34.148
Okay.
Uh, that's fine.

14:34.199 --> 14:35.549
I guess I will see you

14:35.617 --> 14:38.185

14:38.236 --> 14:40.621
Definitely.
Mm-hmm.

No, thanks.
Chris said I could stay.

15:14.022 --> 15:16.323
Chuck. T...

15:16.391 --> 15:18.859
all right.
Fine.

See you later,
Chris Keller.

15:20.061 --> 15:21.228
See ya, buddy.

15:23.915 --> 15:26.566
You really gave him
the business.

15:26.618 --> 15:28.252
Chris Keller
called me "buddy"!

15:36.411 --> 15:38.295
There's my cookie.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.564
Daddy, your cookie's
overbaked.

15:40.632 --> 15:41.915
I've been waiting
forever.

15:41.966 --> 15:43.083
Sorry, angel.

15:43.134 --> 15:44.635
I found my way
to our old country club,

15:44.719 --> 15:45.719
and I couldn't resist.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.438
Golfing or drinking?

15:47.522 --> 15:48.806
A little bit of both.

15:48.890 --> 15:50.190
But here's the good news.

15:50.258 --> 15:51.775
While you were sitting here
sunning yourself,

15:51.860 --> 15:53.593
your old man was schmoozing
an old friend

15:53.645 --> 15:55.095
who wants to invest
in Brooke Davis.

15:55.146 --> 15:56.897
What old friend?

15:56.948 --> 15:58.365
Just some guy I know.

15:58.433 --> 16:00.534
He said he read somewhere that
high-end baby clothes

16:00.601 --> 16:01.568
are gonna be
the next big thing,

16:01.619 --> 16:02.886
and I told him they will be

16:02.954 --> 16:04.738
if my talented daughter's
designing them.

16:04.789 --> 16:08.375
Bet your mother's hooves
never moved that fast.

16:08.443 --> 16:14.415
Dad, how would you feel
if we included mom?

16:14.466 --> 16:16.800
You know, I think
your mother had her chance...

16:16.885 --> 16:18.035
And she betrayed
your trust.

16:18.103 --> 16:20.220
This is our turn.

16:20.288 --> 16:23.140
But, honey,
we're gonna do it right.

16:26.478 --> 16:28.178
You woke up in the park?

16:28.263 --> 16:29.313
Cool!

16:29.397 --> 16:31.648
Thanks a lot.

16:31.733 --> 16:32.799
He needed to know.

16:32.851 --> 16:34.401
Dude, you need to see
a doctor.

16:34.469 --> 16:36.803
I saw a doctor.
Everything's gonna be fine.

16:36.855 --> 16:38.188
Well, until it is,
you can't go to Europe.

16:38.273 --> 16:39.523
That's what I said.

16:39.607 --> 16:40.908
It's only happened
a couple of times.

16:40.975 --> 16:42.025
Four.

16:42.110 --> 16:43.577
And it only happens
at night.

16:43.644 --> 16:44.912
It's like
you're a werewolf.

16:44.979 --> 16:46.997
I have a plan.
All right?

16:47.081 --> 16:49.082
Until the medication fixes it,
I go to Europe.

16:49.150 --> 16:50.367
During the day, I scout,

16:50.452 --> 16:52.419
and at night,
I'll handcuff myself to the bed.

16:52.487 --> 16:54.654
It's totally
like you're a werewolf.

16:54.706 --> 16:56.206
Your plan sucks, wolfy.

16:56.291 --> 16:59.126
That's what I said.

16:59.177 --> 17:00.994
Nate, you've been traveling
a lot.

17:01.045 --> 17:02.463
You have a family.

17:02.514 --> 17:04.263
You also have a partner
in this company

17:04.332 --> 17:05.632
that needs to pull
his own weight.

17:05.683 --> 17:07.834
And you have a partner in this
company who can help you

17:07.886 --> 17:09.887
when you're not at your best,
which clearly you're not.

17:09.971 --> 17:11.355
That's what I...

17:11.439 --> 17:12.606
I said that, too.

17:14.509 --> 17:16.609
You need to get well, Clay.
That's it.

17:16.676 --> 17:18.529
So, what,
you're gonna go to Europe?

17:18.613 --> 17:20.446
Try selling that
to Haley.

17:20.515 --> 17:22.348
I got to go to Europe.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.486
I thought
Clay was going.

17:25.537 --> 17:26.569
I know,
but apparently Clay...

17:26.654 --> 17:29.990
Clay's a werewolf.

17:30.041 --> 17:31.825
Clay's a werewolf.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.994
What?
Nathan, you just got home.

17:34.045 --> 17:35.462
I know. And you have
every right to say that.

17:35.530 --> 17:37.297
But...It turns out Clay

17:37.365 --> 17:38.715
has some kind of
sleeping disorder.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.450
And he's been waking up
all over town.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.369
Quinn found him in a park
the other day,

17:42.420 --> 17:43.971
and the police picked him up
last night.

17:44.038 --> 17:45.606
Oh.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.007
That's bad.

17:47.058 --> 17:48.375
Yeah, his plan
was to go to Europe

17:48.426 --> 17:50.127
and handcuff himself to the bed
at night.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.878
That was his plan?

17:51.930 --> 17:53.213
Exactly.

17:53.264 --> 17:55.649
I know I've been gone
way too much,

17:55.716 --> 17:57.401
but I am his business partner,
Haley,

17:57.485 --> 17:59.269
and the company
is called fortitude.

17:59.354 --> 18:02.239
Stupid name.

18:03.575 --> 18:05.442
Look...

18:05.527 --> 18:07.744
There's a showcase
for international talent.

18:07.829 --> 18:09.079
All the best players
are gonna be there,

18:09.163 --> 18:10.948
and one of us has to go.

18:11.032 --> 18:13.283
I go for a week or so.
Clay gets better.

18:13.368 --> 18:15.536
And then I get to be home
for the rest of the year,

18:15.587 --> 18:16.787
no matter what.

18:18.957 --> 18:20.841
Rrrr!
All right.

18:20.908 --> 18:23.544
You can go to Europe
on one condition...

18:23.595 --> 18:26.263
take me with you
and handcuff me to the bed.

18:26.331 --> 18:27.297
I wish.

18:27.382 --> 18:28.799
You do wish.

18:28.883 --> 18:30.434
I wish, too.

18:30.518 --> 18:31.802
I'm sorry.

18:31.870 --> 18:35.589
I love you, and
I'm not gonna be gone forever.

18:35.640 --> 18:38.392
What do you want to do

18:38.443 --> 18:39.977

huh?

19:58.212 --> 20:00.797
I know he said that stuff
about insurance,

20:00.881 --> 20:05.018
but I just figured
you wouldn't let him stay.

is such a thing

20:51.398 --> 20:52.932
as rehabilitation

So, once your rum ignites, you
wait for the flames to subside.

21:12.453 --> 21:14.153
Then you scoop your ice cream
into a bowl.

21:14.205 --> 21:17.624
And then you top it
with your sauce.

21:20.094 --> 21:22.428
And then you eat it,
the whole thing,

21:22.496 --> 21:24.714

22:30.447 --> 22:32.115
I'm not having any sex.

22:32.199 --> 22:34.000
And my conniving ex-husband
comes into town

22:34.067 --> 22:36.502

daughter's fashion line from me.

22:36.570 --> 22:39.038
First of all, ew.

22:39.089 --> 22:42.175
Second of all,
daddy didn't steal anything.

22:42.242 --> 22:44.594
You said no, mom.

22:44.678 --> 22:45.928
I said, "not yet."

22:46.013 --> 22:48.080
And really? Daddy?

22:48.132 --> 22:50.700
When has he ever been
a father to you?

22:50.768 --> 22:53.219
People change, mother.

22:53.270 --> 22:55.104
Not him.

22:55.189 --> 22:57.640
And why do you need his approval
or his affection anyway?

22:57.725 --> 22:59.225
Because he's my father.

22:59.276 --> 23:01.694
And a poor excuse
for one at that.

23:01.762 --> 23:04.030
And yet you completely disregard
my feelings

23:04.097 --> 23:07.400

how ridiculous it is

that I have to make clothes
to get my parents' attention?

23:28.472 --> 23:30.356
Yet I still do it.
Why?

23:30.424 --> 23:32.675
Because I have
some insane notion

23:32.760 --> 23:35.345
that someday the clothes
are gonna bring us closer

23:35.429 --> 23:37.814
and that maybe,
just maybe,

23:37.898 --> 23:41.651

they were.
