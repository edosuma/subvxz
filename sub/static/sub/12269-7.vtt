WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.174
(Emily) MY FATHER
 WAS AN INNOCENT MAN,

00:03.174 --> 00:05.005
DESTROYED BY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.007
THE GRAYSONS ARE BEHIND THIS,
AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

00:07.007 --> 00:10.081
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE
 TO AVENGING HIS DEATH.

00:10.081 --> 00:11.542
EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S
GONNA FIND YOU OUT.

00:11.542 --> 00:15.116
AND I WON'T STOP UNTIL
 THEY'VE ALL PAID THE PRICE.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.587
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE
THE CLUELESS FRAT BOY

00:16.587 --> 00:20.321
WHO CRASHED YOUR CAR,
CRUSHED MY SPINE,

00:20.321 --> 00:21.622
AND NEVER LOOKED BACK.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.524
SHE LOST HER JOB.
HELPING HER GET ANOTHER

00:23.524 --> 00:25.126
WAS THE LEAST I COULD DO.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.628
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SET FOR LIFE,
SARA. I'M SORRY.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.060
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,
DANIEL?

00:29.060 --> 00:30.361
TO EARN YOUR FORGIVENESS.

00:30.361 --> 00:31.402
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
IN A LONG TIME

00:31.402 --> 00:32.703
TO BE ABLE
TO MAKE ME SMILE.

00:32.703 --> 00:35.136
JACK WENT TO CONRAD
AND TOLD HIM

00:35.136 --> 00:38.139
THAT PATRICK TAMPERED
WITH HIS BRAKES.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.641
HE'S PROBABLY BEING
CHASED OUT OF TOWN AS WE SPEAK.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.413
CONRAD IS A RUTHLESS MAN.
YOU'RE NOT SAFE.

00:42.413 --> 00:44.175
I CAN'T.
 GO!

00:48.319 --> 00:50.521
(Emily) GROWING UP,
 MY FATHER SAID THE OCEAN

00:50.521 --> 00:52.383
WAS A GREAT ESCAPE.

00:53.724 --> 00:56.056
AS TIME PASSED, I ALSO LEARNED

00:56.056 --> 00:58.689
THAT ITS EXPANSE
 HOLDS GREATER SECRETS

00:58.689 --> 01:00.731
AND THE ABILITY TO HOLD MINE...

01:00.731 --> 01:02.193
(buoy bell clanging)

01:02.193 --> 01:04.235
AND THAT LIKE LOVE,
 IT IS AT ITS HEART

01:04.235 --> 01:07.668
FLUID, POWERFUL,
 AND SOMETIMES VIOLENT.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.100
NEXT TIME YOU'RE HERE,

01:09.100 --> 01:12.103
THE AUTHORITIES WILL HAVE
VICTORIA IN CUSTODY.

01:12.103 --> 01:15.506
SOON AFTER, I'LL TAKE YOU
AWAY FROM EVERYTHING...
 AND EVERYONE.

01:15.506 --> 01:16.807
(clacking)

01:19.610 --> 01:21.352
BUT IN ITS HARSHEST REALITY,

01:21.352 --> 01:24.215
THE OCEAN IS A BARRIER

01:24.215 --> 01:26.517
SEPARATING YOU
 FROM THOSE YOU LOVE.

01:26.517 --> 01:31.122
WHEN THIS IS DONE, I'LL NEVER
SEE MY SISTER AGAIN...

01:31.122 --> 01:32.223
OR NOLAN.

01:34.765 --> 01:37.328
I KNOW.

01:39.470 --> 01:42.233
YOU'LL BE OKAY.

01:44.275 --> 01:47.138
ARE YOU WRITING A LETTER
TO PATRICK--

01:47.138 --> 01:48.509
YOUR NATURAL BORN KILLER?

01:48.509 --> 01:50.511
IT'S THE ONLY MEANS
OF CORRESPONDENCE I HAVE

01:50.511 --> 01:52.283
TO KEEP AWAY
FROM THE PRYING EYES

01:52.283 --> 01:54.415
OF THE MINIONS I'M SURE
YOU HAVE LOOKING FOR HIM.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.647
WHY WOULD I WASTE
THE TIME AND EFFORT?

01:56.647 --> 02:01.222
IT'S THAT SMUG SMIRK
I'M GOING TO MISS THE LEAST

02:01.222 --> 02:02.653
AFTER WE'VE CONVERTED
OUR MONEY,

02:02.653 --> 02:04.425
AND I HAVE LEFT YOU FOR GOOD.

02:04.425 --> 02:07.198
NOW THERE'S AN ACTION
THAT MAY COMPEL ME

02:07.198 --> 02:09.460
TO HIRE SOME FOLKS
TO GO LOOKING FOR YOUR BOY.

02:09.460 --> 02:12.803
EXCUSE MY CONFUSION, CONRAD,

02:12.803 --> 02:16.907
BUT ARE YOU THREATENING PATRICK
TO KEEP ME BY YOUR SIDE?

02:16.907 --> 02:18.669
YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE I AM...

02:18.669 --> 02:21.572
STARTING WITH YOUR MAGNIFICENT
PRESENCE DOWNSTAIRS

02:21.572 --> 02:23.143
FOR THE LITTLE GRAYSON CONFAB

02:23.143 --> 02:25.746
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
FORGOTTEN ABOUT.

02:25.746 --> 02:29.149
I'VE ENLISTED A P.R. SPECIALIST
TO HELP RIGHT THE COURSE

02:29.149 --> 02:30.381
OF MY TRAJECTORY.

02:30.381 --> 02:32.923
SO IF YOU VALUE
PATRICK'S FREEDOM,

02:32.923 --> 02:36.287
YOU KNOW, YOU MAY WANT
TO FIND SOME PUBLIC WORTH

02:36.287 --> 02:39.590
IN THE FAMILY YOU STILL HAVE.

02:39.590 --> 02:41.662
(footsteps depart)

02:41.662 --> 02:44.164
I STILL DON'T SEE WHY
WE'RE HERE.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.496
IF MY FATHER WANTS
TO REHAB HIS IMAGE,

02:45.496 --> 02:46.637
HE CAN DO IT HIMSELF.

02:46.637 --> 02:48.769
I'VE ALREADY EDUCATED HIM
ON REBRANDING

02:48.769 --> 02:52.273
AND HOW YOU'RE ALL
 AN EXTENSION OF HIS GOOD NAME.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.274
I'M A CLARKE.

WHEN THE RICH HELP THE POOR.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.784
BUT WHERE'S THE BANG
FOR MY WEDDING BUCK?

03:03.784 --> 03:06.517
THERE WERE NO CAMERAS
WHEN YOU WENT RING SHOPPING.

03:06.517 --> 03:08.789
HAS THE VENUE EVEN BEEN
ANNOUNCED?

03:08.789 --> 03:12.863
WHO'S MAKING THE CAKE?
 WE ARE NOT
A VERY SHOWY COUPLE.

03:12.863 --> 03:15.926

BACK INTO AMERICA'S HEARTS,

09:52.823 --> 09:54.294
ABOUT EARNING MY FORGIVENESS.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.326
I TOLD YOU, THAT'S NOT
WHO I AM ANYMORE.

09:56.326 --> 09:58.729
I WANT TO HELP.
 YEAH, WELL, I DON'T WANT
YOUR CHARITY, DANNY.

09:58.729 --> 10:00.130
GOOD, 'CAUSE I'M NOT
OFFERING YOU ANY.

10:00.130 --> 10:03.704
WHAT I AM OFFERING
IS A CHANCE AT A JOB YOU WANT--

10:03.704 --> 10:05.305
ONE THAT COULD
BE GOOD FOR YOU.

10:08.679 --> 10:10.280
THINK ABOUT IT.

10:12.743 --> 10:14.184
(chuckles)

10:14.184 --> 10:16.887
LIKE I SAID, HE'D BE PERFECT
FOR A PROFILE PIECE

10:16.887 --> 10:19.219
IN YOUR MAGAZINE.
THINK ABOUT IT.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.021
(cell phone beeps,
horns honking in distance)

10:21.021 --> 10:24.725
SORRY. THIS THING BEATS
MORE OFTEN THAN MY HEART.
 (beeping)

10:24.725 --> 10:27.798
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT I'M KEEPING
YOU ALL DRY UNDER MY UMBRELLA.

10:27.798 --> 10:29.830
CONRAD DID NOT TELL ME
JUST HOW MUCH

10:29.830 --> 10:31.401
THIS FAMILY WAS
WEIGHING HIM DOWN.

10:31.401 --> 10:34.234
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IS THAT WHY I'M HERE?

10:34.234 --> 10:37.407
UH, A BLOGGER CALLED
ABOUT A PIECE THAT I PLANTED

10:37.407 --> 10:39.069
ABOUT YOU AND DANIEL--

10:39.069 --> 10:40.741
HOW SOCIALITE EMILY THORNE

10:40.741 --> 10:42.312
WAITED TO FIND
HER PRINCE CHARMING.

10:42.312 --> 10:45.375
IT'S... GOOD. BUT...

10:45.375 --> 10:49.049
THIS WEASEL CLAIMS
TO HAVE PROOF

10:49.049 --> 10:50.751
THAT YOU WERE HITCHED BEFORE.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.754
WHAT?

10:55.956 --> 10:58.658
I WAS REALLY YOUNG.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.792
IT WAS A MISTAKE.
I MEAN, SURELY YOU UNDERSTAND.

11:01.792 --> 11:03.964
(cup clatters)
 ACTUALLY...

11:03.964 --> 11:06.666
I'M ONE OF THE LUCKY FEW
WHO WAS RIGHT

11:06.666 --> 11:09.299
ABOUT HER HIGH SCHOOL
SWEETHEART.
 (clicking)

11:09.299 --> 11:12.973
JEFF AND I HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR 22 YEARS.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.806
AND WE ARE STILL AS IN LOVE
AS I'M SURE YOU AND DANIEL ARE.

11:15.806 --> 11:16.777
THIS CAN'T GET OUT.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.308
I'M A GRAVEDIGGER, BABE.

11:18.308 --> 11:19.810
I BURY THINGS BIGGER
THAN THIS EVERY DAY.

11:19.810 --> 11:22.052
GOOD, 'CAUSE NOBODY CAN KNOW,
ESPECIALLY VICTORIA.

11:23.053 --> 11:26.416
(sighs) WE'RE NOT REALLY
THE BEST OF FRIENDS.

11:26.416 --> 11:28.819
I JUST CAN'T WIN WITH HER.

11:28.819 --> 11:30.821
IF SHE FINDS THIS OUT,
SHE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME.

11:30.821 --> 11:34.865
WELL... I CAUGHT THE BULLET
THIS TIME.
 (cup clatters)

11:34.865 --> 11:36.797
BUT SECRETS HAVE A WAY
OF BLEEDING OUT.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.869
SO LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE.

11:38.869 --> 11:40.300
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU HIDING?

11:40.300 --> 11:44.304
NOTHING, I SWEAR.

11:44.304 --> 11:47.808
(shower running,
faucet turns off)

11:53.814 --> 11:55.385
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

11:57.087 --> 11:59.790
CONRAD'S HIRED A PUBLICIST
WHO'S DETERMINED

11:59.790 --> 12:01.491
TO PUT A SHEEN
ON EVERYTHING WE DO,

12:01.491 --> 12:03.153
INCLUDING PROMOTING
THIS WEDDING,

12:03.153 --> 12:04.855
WHICH IF
WE DON'T ACT QUICKLY,

12:04.855 --> 12:07.257
IT'LL BE TOO LATE
TO DO ANYTHING.

12:07.257 --> 12:08.999
I THOUGHT YOU WERE RELYING
ON JACK PORTER

12:08.999 --> 12:11.331
TO BREAK THEM UP.
 I'VE HEARD THAT HE'S COURTING
MS. LeMARCHAL.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.764
SO CLEARLY THAT WON'T BE
COMING TO FRUITION.

12:13.764 --> 12:15.465
THEN WE'LL FIND
ANOTHER WAY.

12:15.465 --> 12:17.768
OH, WE WON'T.

12:17.768 --> 12:19.269
YOU WILL.

12:19.269 --> 12:23.073
MY SON HAS NO SHORTAGE
OF HATRED TOWARDS YOU.

12:23.073 --> 12:25.776
SO GET BACK
IN EMILY'S LIFE...

12:25.776 --> 12:28.448
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
HER BED.

12:30.821 --> 12:32.783
THE BLOGGER PERSONA
WAS CONVINCING.

12:32.783 --> 12:34.985
LET'S JUST HOPE BIZZY SPREADS
THE NEWS LIKE I WANT HER TO.

12:34.985 --> 12:36.526
OH, TRUST ME.

12:36.526 --> 12:38.388
SHE KNOWS THAT SHARING
INFORMATION LIKE THAT

12:38.388 --> 12:40.861
KEEPS HER
ON THE GRAYSON PAYROLL.

12:40.861 --> 12:44.334
AND ONCE SHE DOES,
THE TWO OF US

12:44.334 --> 12:46.196
WILL BIZ-MANTLE HER
WITH GLEE.

12:46.196 --> 12:47.898
YOU SURE YOU'RE UP FOR IT,
GRANDPA?

12:47.898 --> 12:50.000
(scoffs)

12:50.000 --> 12:54.344
I'M NOT GETTING OLDER,
JUST... WISER.

12:54.344 --> 12:57.407
(typing)
 BUT TRYING TO UNEARTH
BIZZY'S CLIENTS' SECRETS

12:57.407 --> 12:59.549
IS TAKING LONGER
THAN I THOUGHT.

12:59.549 --> 13:01.511
HACKING
HER PROTON 5 FIREWALL

13:01.511 --> 13:04.184
WILL TAKE TIME
THAT I DON'T HAVE.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.857
WHY THE LOOK?

13:06.857 --> 13:08.258
IF THIS HAD HAPPENED
A FEW YEARS AGO,

13:08.258 --> 13:10.360
YOU WOULD HAVE THROWN
A MARTINI IN HER FACE

13:10.360 --> 13:13.463
AND CALLED IT A DAY.
BUT NOW...

13:13.463 --> 13:15.565
I'M STANDING UP FOR MYSELF.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.929
I JUST...

13:18.929 --> 13:21.872
BURIED THE PAIN
OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY FATHER,

13:21.872 --> 13:26.206
BUT BECAUSE OF YOU,
I'M NOT JUST FACING IT.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.509
I'M DOING SOMETHING.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.581
I'VE LEARNED A LOT
FROM YOU, EMS.

13:31.581 --> 13:34.344
WE MADE A GREAT TEAM.

13:36.286 --> 13:39.850
WELL, IF WE'RE GONNA WIN...
 (types)

13:39.850 --> 13:41.191
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A NEW GAME PLAN.

13:41.191 --> 13:43.393
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME
FOR THIS FIREWALL,

13:43.393 --> 13:45.355
SO WE'VE GOT TO GET
HER PASSWORD.

13:45.355 --> 13:47.357
EXCEPT THAT PHONE
NEVER LEAVES HER HANDS.

13:47.357 --> 13:51.131
MAYBE IT DOESN'T NEED TO.

13:53.864 --> 13:56.136
(up-tempo piano playing)

13:56.136 --> 13:59.209
(laughter)

14:05.475 --> 14:07.017
(laughs)

14:07.017 --> 14:09.519
I'M GLAD I DECIDED
TO TAKE THE EVENING OFF.

14:09.519 --> 14:11.882
(buoy bell clanging in distance)

14:11.882 --> 14:14.224
(inhales sharply)

14:14.224 --> 14:18.158
(sighs) IT'S BEAUTIFUL
OUT HERE, ISN'T IT?

14:18.158 --> 14:21.861
YEAH, IT'S LIKE
YOUR OWN LITTLE SANCTUARY.

14:21.861 --> 14:26.066
WHERE NO ONE CAN FIND US.

14:26.066 --> 14:29.069
(waves lapping)

14:41.351 --> 14:43.113
WHAT?

14:43.113 --> 14:45.615
UH, HAVE I DONE
SOMETHING WRONG?
 NO. NO.

14:45.615 --> 14:49.489
IT'S... (sighs)

14:49.489 --> 14:51.391
LET'S JUST TRY
TO ENJOY THE MOVIE

14:51.391 --> 14:55.265
AND HAVE ANOTHER GLASS
OF WINE.

14:55.265 --> 14:58.999
UNLESS... I CAN GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND MAKE ANOTHER DRINK.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.131
NO, I DON'T NEED
ANYTHING FROM THE BAR.

15:01.131 --> 15:04.234
WINE IT IS, THEN.

15:04.234 --> 15:07.277
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

15:07.277 --> 15:09.639
(sighs)
 (pours wine)

15:12.582 --> 15:15.685
OKAY, I THINK IT'S BEST
IF I GO.

15:15.685 --> 15:18.348
MARGAUX.
 IT'S OKAY.

15:18.348 --> 15:20.650
I HAVE AN EARLY MORNING.

15:20.650 --> 15:23.593
ENJOY
YOUR BEAUTIFUL EVENING.

15:33.363 --> 15:34.604
YOU'RE LATE.

15:34.604 --> 15:36.236
DANIEL HELD ME UP.

15:36.236 --> 15:39.539
HE WANTS HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND
TO MAKE OUR WEDDING CAKE.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.641
HE SET UP A TASTING
AT MY HOUSE TOMORROW.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.243
DO YOU SUSPECT
SOMETHING'S AMISS?

15:43.243 --> 15:46.476
NO. I'M SURE HE'S DOING IT
OUT OF GUILT.

15:46.476 --> 15:48.018
DANIEL'S THE REASON
I NEEDED TO MEET WITH YOU.

15:48.018 --> 15:49.519
VICTORIA'S COMPELLED ME
TO GET BACK INTO YOUR ORBIT

15:49.519 --> 15:52.282
IN ORDER TO DRIVE A WEDGE
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

15:52.282 --> 15:54.424
WELL, THAT'S NOT AN OPTION,
NOT THIS CLOSE TO THE WEDDING.

15:54.424 --> 15:55.455
YEAH, BUT IF I DON'T
SEE IT THROUGH,

15:55.455 --> 15:56.987
I MAY LOSE ACCESS
TO THE GRAYSONS.

15:56.987 --> 15:59.529
(sighs)

15:59.529 --> 16:01.161
MAYBE THERE'S A THIRD WAY.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.692
AND THAT IS?

16:02.692 --> 16:06.096
TO BE SEEN TOGETHER...

16:06.096 --> 16:07.367
BUT ON OUR OWN TERMS.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.248
THIS IS THE LAST ONE,
I PROMISE.
 ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

16:18.248 --> 16:19.649
EACH ONE'S BEEN BETTER
THAN THE LAST.

16:19.649 --> 16:21.681
ARE THESE... FAMILY RECIPES?

16:21.681 --> 16:23.413
YEAH, PASSED DOWN
FROM MY MOM'S SIDE.

16:23.413 --> 16:24.754
WELL, YOUR MOM
TAUGHT YOU WELL.

16:24.754 --> 16:26.386
WELL, SHE RAISED ME
AND MY BROTHER

16:26.386 --> 16:29.459
AFTER MY DAD DITCHED US,
SO EVERYTHING I KNOW

16:29.459 --> 16:32.292
I LEARNED FROM HER,
INCLUDING HOW TO MAKE A MESS.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.365
I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT THIS DISASTER.

16:35.365 --> 16:37.027
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

16:37.027 --> 16:39.369
BUT... I BETTER STOP, OR I'LL BE
FULL FOR MY LUNCH WITH VICTORIA.

16:39.369 --> 16:41.571
WELL, IF IT'D HELP
MAKE THE LUNCH SHORTER,

16:41.571 --> 16:42.602
I'D SAY EAT UP.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.175
(chuckles)
 THANKS AGAIN...

16:45.175 --> 16:46.276
FOR GIVING ME A SHOT.

16:46.276 --> 16:49.008
OF COURSE. THANK YOU.
SEE YA.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.381
(lowered voice) HEY...

16:51.381 --> 16:53.183
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
CONSIDERING THIS.

16:53.183 --> 16:55.215
IT'S JUST SOMETHING I...
I WANT TO DO, YOU KNOW?

16:55.215 --> 16:57.047
(lowered voice) IT'S A GREAT
THING THAT YOU'RE DOING.

16:57.047 --> 17:00.690
AND I... I THINK SHE'LL MAKE
A WONDERFUL WEDDING CAKE.

17:00.690 --> 17:02.492
(chuckles)
 ME, TOO.

17:02.492 --> 17:04.354
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY?

17:05.555 --> 17:07.327
YOU GOT THE JOB.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.559
SHUT UP. SERIOUSLY?

17:09.559 --> 17:12.662
I'M SERIOUS.
 (exhales)

17:12.662 --> 17:16.536
MAN, SHE IS WAY MORE MATURE
THAN I AM. I MEAN...

17:16.536 --> 17:19.339
LETTING YOUR FIANCé'S EX
MAKE YOUR WEDDING CAKE--

17:19.339 --> 17:21.570
IF THE TABLES WERE TURNED,
I WOULD BE SO JEALOUS

17:21.570 --> 17:23.073
AND WOULD HAVE CANCELED
THE WHOLE THING.

17:23.073 --> 17:25.474
OH, WELL, THAT'S EMILY.
 AND YOU...

17:25.474 --> 17:28.678
EVEN ASKING HER TO LET ME
MAKE THE CAKE--

17:28.678 --> 17:31.050
THAT TOOK GUTS. I MEAN,
WHAT IF THESE WERE AWFUL?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.452
I KNEW THEY WOULDN'T BE.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.783
I GOTTA SAY THAT, UH...

17:33.783 --> 17:37.687
FORGIVENESS THING
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR...

17:37.687 --> 17:40.130
THIS GOES A LONG WAY
TOWARD IT.

17:40.130 --> 17:42.262
(chuckles) WELL...

17:42.262 --> 17:44.494
I SHOULD CLEAN UP.
 OKAY.

17:44.494 --> 17:46.136
HEY, LET ME HELP YOU.
I-I GOT IT.

17:46.136 --> 17:48.638
I CAN HELP--
 NO, DANNY, YOU HIRED ME.
IT'S MY JOB.

17:48.638 --> 17:50.300
THEN I'M GIVING YOU
THE REST OF THE DAY OFF.

17:50.300 --> 17:53.703
(chuckles)
 GO HOME.

17:53.703 --> 17:54.804
(dish clatters)

17:54.804 --> 17:58.548
SO... HOW WAS YOUR DATE
WITH MARGAUX?

17:58.548 --> 17:59.749
(pen clatters)

17:59.749 --> 18:02.252
THINGS WERE FINE...

18:02.252 --> 18:04.714
UNTIL... THEY WEREN'T.

18:04.714 --> 18:08.618
OKAY. WHAT HAPPENED?

18:08.618 --> 18:09.789
(chuckles) I DON'T KNOW.
SHE JUST--

18:09.789 --> 18:11.591
SHE LEFT
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

18:11.591 --> 18:15.665
WHAT, FOR NO REASON?
WHAT'S UP, JACK?

18:15.665 --> 18:18.698
UH...

18:18.698 --> 18:20.830
I JUST...

18:20.830 --> 18:23.133
I BLEW IT. (chuckles)

18:23.133 --> 18:24.674
I MEAN, I DIDN'T WANT TO,
BUT I JUST--

18:24.674 --> 18:27.237
I COULDN'T HANDLE IT.
(inhales deeply)

18:27.237 --> 18:31.110
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS,
RIGHT?

18:32.342 --> 18:34.214
YEAH.
 I THINK...

18:34.214 --> 18:38.248
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO FACE IT.

18:41.651 --> 18:44.624
(sighs)

18:44.624 --> 18:46.696
I MUST ADMIT,
I WAS A BIT SURPRISED

18:46.696 --> 18:48.298
WHEN I HEARD
FROM YOUR PUBLICIST.

18:48.298 --> 18:49.659
(pen clinks)
 OH.

18:49.659 --> 18:52.662
SO SHE TELLS ME YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOME PRESS COVERAGE.

18:52.662 --> 18:55.605
OH, UH, THERE MUST BE
SOME CONFUSION.

18:55.605 --> 18:59.209
WHAT MS. PRESTON OFFERED YOU
WAS AN EXCLUSIVE.

18:59.209 --> 19:03.413
CONRAD GRAYSON IS BACK.
HE'S A SURVIVOR...

19:03.413 --> 19:05.245
A LAUDATORY PROFILE
OF SORTS.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.676
IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION.

19:06.676 --> 19:09.379
WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN
JOURNALISTIC INTEGRITY.

19:09.379 --> 19:13.483
THOUGH COVERING DANIEL'S WEDDING
ISN'T A CONFLICT OF INTEREST?

19:13.483 --> 19:15.625
TOUCHé, MR. GRAYSON.
 MM.

19:15.625 --> 19:18.788
BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A SOCIETY PIECE

19:18.788 --> 19:20.630
AND AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR YOU.

19:20.630 --> 19:25.635
NOW, IF YOU WERE TO GIVE ME
ACCESS TO ALL YOUR PAPERS

19:25.635 --> 19:29.369
AND... ARCHIVES...
THEN MAYBE WE COULD TALK.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.472
MS. LeMARCHAL, I'M NOT HERE
TO DWELL ON THE PAST.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.704
WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING
TO BE TOTALLY HONEST WITH ME,

19:34.704 --> 19:36.706
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
MOVING FORWARD.

19:38.248 --> 19:42.252
BUT I'M SURE THERE'S A STORY
IN YOU NO ONE EXPECTS.

19:42.252 --> 19:44.854
YOU JUST NEED THE GUTS
TO TELL IT.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.220
(piano playing mid-tempo jazz)
 YOU SEE HOW EASY THIS IS?

19:50.220 --> 19:53.192
WITH YOU TWO ON THE SAME PAGE,
IT WON'T PULL FOCUS

19:53.192 --> 19:56.396
AS WE CAN EASE CONRAD
BACK INTO THE SPOTLIGHT.
 MM.

19:56.396 --> 19:59.429
WELL, THIS ITINERARY
IS TOO AGGRESSIVE.

19:59.429 --> 20:01.971
SURELY THE 200 PEOPLE
I'M HOSTING THIS EVENING

20:01.971 --> 20:03.603
MEANS I'VE DONE MY DUTY.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.475
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN MOST

20:05.475 --> 20:06.906
THAT CHANGING PUBLIC OPINION
TAKES TIME.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.809
AND I HAVE MERE WEEKS
UNTIL EVERYONE SEES YOU

30:18.447 --> 30:22.051
♪♪♪

30:22.051 --> 30:24.223
HEY.

30:25.955 --> 30:27.897
LOOK,

30:27.897 --> 30:30.029
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.963
IT'S BEEN A ROUGH YEAR.

30:33.963 --> 30:35.564
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

30:35.564 --> 30:38.137
LOOK, I HAVEN'T BROUGHT IT UP
BECAUSE I FELT

30:38.137 --> 30:39.939
YOU DIDN'T WANNA TALK
ABOUT IT.

30:39.939 --> 30:45.444
I DIDN'T. THAT'S...
PART OF THE PROBLEM.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.277
BUT...

30:50.449 --> 30:53.152
I HOPE THAT YOU'LL GIVE ME
ANOTHER CHANCE.

30:56.285 --> 30:59.328
YOU TOOK OFF YOUR RING.

30:59.328 --> 31:02.261
(fireworks whistling)
 (guests gasp)

31:02.261 --> 31:04.263
(fireworks popping)

31:04.263 --> 31:07.296
(indistinct conversations)

31:07.296 --> 31:10.299
(fireworks continue whistling
and popping)

31:14.443 --> 31:16.275
(exhales)

31:16.275 --> 31:20.449
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO WATCH
THE FIREWORKS ON YOUR ROOF?

31:20.449 --> 31:21.650
(chuckles)

31:30.359 --> 31:33.362
(crackling)

31:37.326 --> 31:40.299
HEY.
I BROUGHT YOU A JACKET.

31:40.299 --> 31:42.101
(fireworks whistling
and popping)

31:42.101 --> 31:45.074
HOPE YOU'RE NOT HIDING
FROM MY MOTHER.

31:45.074 --> 31:46.976
SHE DOESN'T SCARE ME
ANYMORE.

31:46.976 --> 31:48.907
BUT, MAN,
DOES SHE STILL TRY.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.409
YEAH, SHE TENDS
TO GO ALL OUT.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.281
(chuckles) CLEARLY.

31:52.281 --> 31:54.913
YEAH, I WOULDN'T MISS
THIS SHOW.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.986
(popping)

31:56.986 --> 31:59.218
I REMEMBER MY MOM
TAKING US KIDS OUT

31:59.218 --> 32:02.321
EVERY WEEKEND DURING THE SEASON
TO SEE THEM ON CONEY ISLAND.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.223
YEAH, FRIDAY NIGHTS
ON THE BOARDWALK.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.524
9:30 SHARP.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.056
OH, YOU'VE BEEN?

32:07.056 --> 32:09.458
BEST SEATS IN THE HOUSE
ARE BETWEEN 10th AND 15th.

32:09.458 --> 32:11.000
NEVER MISSED IT AS A KID.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.001
(laughs) NO WAY.

32:12.001 --> 32:13.702
OF COURSE,
I WAS WITH MY NANNY,

32:13.702 --> 32:15.304
BUT... WHO KNOWS?

32:15.304 --> 32:19.068
MAYBE WE MET ONCE
AT THE HOT DOG STAND.

32:19.068 --> 32:21.170
(fireworks hiss)

32:21.170 --> 32:23.442
(popping)
 (guests gasp)

32:26.015 --> 32:29.318
IF YOU HAD TOLD ME
I'D EVER BE BACK HERE

32:29.318 --> 32:31.120
SITTING NEXT TO YOU...

32:31.120 --> 32:33.722
WELL...

32:33.722 --> 32:35.524
THINGS CHANGE.

32:37.626 --> 32:39.688
YEAH.

32:39.688 --> 32:42.231
GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.299
(fireworks whistle)

32:50.299 --> 32:52.171
(popping continues)

32:52.171 --> 32:55.104
(buttons click)

32:55.104 --> 32:56.975
(lowered voice) YOU'RE HACKING
BIZZY'S PHONE HERE?

32:56.975 --> 32:58.247
WHAT IF SOMEBODY SAW YOU?

32:58.247 --> 33:02.711
WHAT? I GOT EXCITED.
PLUS I WAITED TILL SHE LEFT.

33:02.711 --> 33:04.583
(chuckles)
 DID YOU GET
WHAT YOU NEEDED?

33:04.583 --> 33:07.116
AND SO MUCH MORE.

33:07.116 --> 33:08.657
CHECK OUT THIS STRING
OF DIRTY TEXTS

33:08.657 --> 33:10.489
FROM MS. PRESTON HERSELF.

33:10.489 --> 33:13.122
WAIT. TREVOR?

33:13.122 --> 33:14.463
I THOUGHT HER HUSBAND'S NAME
WAS JEFF.

33:14.463 --> 33:20.169
IT IS. SEEMS OUR DEAR BIZZY
HAS BEEN GETTING BUSY

33:20.169 --> 33:22.471
COVERING UP STORIES
OF HER OWN.

33:22.471 --> 33:25.274
DRINK?

33:25.274 --> 33:28.477
(fireworks whistling
and popping)

33:28.477 --> 33:31.480
(Ellie Goulding's "Tessellate"
playing)

33:36.245 --> 33:38.347
(lowered voice) I DON'T
WANT US TO RUSH ANYTHING.

33:38.347 --> 33:42.091
WE CAN GO UP
AND WATCH THE FIREWORKS.

33:42.091 --> 33:46.055
♪ WILD GREEN STONES ALONE ♪

33:46.055 --> 33:48.597
♪ MY LOVER ♪

33:50.059 --> 33:58.137
♪ AND KEEP US ON MY HEART ♪

34:09.078 --> 34:10.679
WHAT'S THIS?

34:10.679 --> 34:12.251
IT'S THE 4th OF JULY,

34:12.251 --> 34:15.724
THE DAY WE AMERICANS
CELEBRATE RIDDING OURSELVES

34:15.724 --> 34:17.126
OF THE BRITISH.

34:17.126 --> 34:18.786
BUT I'M MAKING PROGRESS.

34:18.786 --> 34:21.130
I HAVE EMILY
IN GOOD GRACES.

34:21.130 --> 34:22.761
WELL, YOUR SAD ATTEMPTS
AT WOOING HER

34:22.761 --> 34:25.264
HAVE FAILED
TO HAVE THEIR DESIRED EFFECT.

34:25.264 --> 34:28.065
DANIEL'S UNCONCERNED
WITH YOUR RENEWED RELATIONSHIP.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.197
WELL, THEN I'LL CHANGE
HIS MIND.

34:29.197 --> 34:31.699
OH, BUT YOU DON'T
SEEM TO UNDERSTAND.

34:31.699 --> 34:34.203
I'M DECLARING
MY INDEPENDENCE.

34:34.203 --> 34:36.205
VICTORIA, YOU CAN'T DENY

34:36.205 --> 34:37.505
THAT WE'VE MADE A GOOD TEAM
THUS FAR,

34:37.505 --> 34:42.150
AND... BESIDES...

34:42.150 --> 34:43.411
YOU CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.

34:43.411 --> 34:46.455
OH, YOU UNDERESTIMATE ME,
MR. MATHIS.

34:46.455 --> 34:49.788
YET ANOTHER REASON WHY
YOUR TIME HERE IS OVER.

34:49.788 --> 34:52.321
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND...

34:52.321 --> 34:55.264
GET THE HELL
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

35:06.275 --> 35:07.536
WHAT HAPPENED?

35:07.536 --> 35:09.178
I DON'T KNOW.
VICTORIA'S GONE CRAZY.

35:09.178 --> 35:10.709
SHE JUST KICKED ME OUT
ON A WHIM.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.511
MEANS SHE'S GOT
SOMETHING ELSE UP HER SLEEVE.

35:12.511 --> 35:13.782
AND I'LL BE DAMNED IF I
DON'T FIND OUT WHAT IT IS.

35:13.782 --> 35:15.444
JUST DON'T OVERREACT.

35:15.444 --> 35:17.516
I DON'T WANT HER
TO GET SUSPICIOUS.

35:17.516 --> 35:20.749
WELL, THEN WHAT CAN I DO
TO HELP?

35:22.891 --> 35:24.423
JUST GO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING'S READY

35:24.423 --> 35:26.555
FOR WHEN THIS IS DONE.

35:26.555 --> 35:28.557
COME BACK
WHEN THE DUST SETTLES.

35:28.557 --> 35:31.400
WELL, AT LEAST I GET
TO SAY GOOD-BYE THIS TIME.

35:31.400 --> 35:32.861
(chuckles)

35:59.188 --> 36:00.529
HERE YOU GO.

36:00.529 --> 36:02.731
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING FANCIER,
I CAN RUN DOWNSTAIRS.

36:02.731 --> 36:04.893
OH, DO YOU HAVE
AN ESPRESSO MACHINE?

36:04.893 --> 36:07.536
NO, NO, I JUST MEANT
I CAN PUT IT IN A NICER MUG.

36:07.536 --> 36:10.739
(chuckles) OKAY.

36:12.901 --> 36:15.844
OH, I'M AFRAID I NEED
TO GET TO THE OFFICE.

36:15.844 --> 36:17.806
STAY FOR BREAKFAST.

36:17.806 --> 36:19.808
I MAKE A MEAN PANCAKE.

36:19.808 --> 36:21.810
(chuckles)
RAIN CHECK, PLEASE.
 MM.

36:21.810 --> 36:24.913
NO, I'M HEARING
A BOOK PROPOSAL THIS MORNING,

36:24.913 --> 36:29.258
AND I IMAGINE CONRAD GRAYSON
WAITS FOR NO ONE.

36:29.258 --> 36:30.789
CONRAD?

36:30.789 --> 36:31.860
MM-HMM.

36:31.860 --> 36:33.762
WHAT'S HE PITCHING,
A BOOK OF LIES?

36:33.762 --> 36:38.227
PROBABLY, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN'T GET THE REAL STORY.

36:38.227 --> 36:40.529
I HAVE A FEELING IT'S MUCH
MORE INTERESTING

36:40.529 --> 36:41.830
THAN ANY OF US KNOW.

36:41.830 --> 36:44.803
(sips)

36:47.376 --> 36:50.479
HI! GREAT PARTY
LAST NIGHT, HUH?

36:50.479 --> 36:51.640
(chuckles)

36:51.640 --> 36:53.442
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THE GRAYSONS ARE TRENDING?

36:53.442 --> 36:55.614
OH, I CAN.

36:55.614 --> 36:58.347
YOU DO ANYTHING
FOR YOUR CLIENTS, DON'T YOU?

36:58.347 --> 37:00.989
EVEN IF IT HURTS
SOMEONE ELSE.

37:00.989 --> 37:03.552
ARE YOU STILL ON
ABOUT THAT STORY

37:03.552 --> 37:05.724
I PLANTED IN THE PRESS
YEARS AGO?

37:05.724 --> 37:09.528
OH. YOU MEAN THE ONE
THAT NEARLY DESTROYED ME?

37:09.528 --> 37:12.761
THAT LEFT ME FEELING
COMPLETELY ALONE,

37:12.761 --> 37:16.665
THAT COST ME THE LAST TEN YEARS
OF MY FATHER'S LIFE?

37:16.665 --> 37:19.808
YEAH. YOU DID THAT.

37:19.808 --> 37:21.540
SO WHY ARE YOU HERE?

37:23.842 --> 37:25.844
FOR PAYBACK.

37:25.844 --> 37:27.516
WELL... SEE, AT FIRST,

37:27.516 --> 37:30.919
I WAS JUST GOING TO OUT
OF YOUR CLIENTS' SECRETS,

37:30.919 --> 37:33.822
BUT THEN I THOUGHT,
WELL, IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT

37:33.822 --> 37:35.984
THEY HAVE
DRUG AND ANGER ISSUES.

37:35.984 --> 37:39.558
OH, AND THAT, UH, GUY WITH
THE THING FOR THE DIAPERS...

37:39.558 --> 37:40.789
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

37:40.789 --> 37:42.431
THAT IS
TOTALLY SECURE INFORMATION.

37:42.431 --> 37:45.634
LITTLE BIRDIE TOLD ME.
(chuckles)

37:45.634 --> 37:48.737
AND THEN... SENT E-MAILS

37:48.737 --> 37:50.268
TO ALL YOUR CLIENTS,

37:50.268 --> 37:52.941
EXPLAINING HOW SLOPPY YOU ARE
AT GUARDING THEIR SINS.

37:52.941 --> 37:54.603
YOU'LL DESTROY MY CAREER.

37:54.603 --> 37:57.706
AH, WELL, BIZZY,
I ALREADY DID.

37:57.706 --> 38:02.451
AND... NOW THAT YOU'RE
OFFICIALLY OUT OF BUSINESS,

38:02.451 --> 38:04.613
YOU'RE MINE.

38:04.613 --> 38:07.586
NOW IF AND WHEN I NEED YOU,

38:07.586 --> 38:11.620
I'LL CALL. OTHERWISE,
THAT PHONE STAYS SILENT.

38:11.620 --> 38:14.923
AND THAT INCLUDES
SEXTING TREVOR VANCE.

38:14.923 --> 38:17.496
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.

38:17.496 --> 38:18.627
HUH.

38:18.627 --> 38:21.700
THEN WHY DO YOU VISIT
HIS HOUSE IN WESTPORT

38:21.700 --> 38:23.001
THREE NIGHTS A WEEK?

38:23.001 --> 38:25.604
NOLAN...

38:25.604 --> 38:29.808
JEFF'S... HE'S A GOOD MAN.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.010
AND IT WOULD KILL HIM
IF HE FOUND OUT.

38:40.949 --> 38:42.851
ALL RIGHT.

38:42.851 --> 38:45.794
THEN I'LL GIVE YOU
A CHOICE--

38:45.794 --> 38:48.797
ONE THAT YOU NEVER HAD
THE COURTESY TO EXTEND TO ME

38:48.797 --> 38:51.900
ALL OF THOSE YEARS AGO.

38:51.900 --> 38:53.462
AND THE AFFAIR...

38:53.462 --> 38:56.004
TODAY.

38:56.004 --> 39:01.540
GO BACK TO THE MAN
THAT CLEARLY LOVES YOU.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.111
OTHERWISE...

39:04.813 --> 39:07.776
I TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

39:09.948 --> 39:12.551
I AM SORRY...

39:12.551 --> 39:14.753
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR FATHER.

39:20.429 --> 39:22.030
I'VE WAITED TEN YEARS
TO HEAR THAT.

39:25.063 --> 39:28.036
IT'S JUST TOO BAD
HE NEVER WILL.

39:45.153 --> 39:46.885
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

39:46.885 --> 39:48.857
FOR MY COLDNESS TOWARD YOU
LAST NIGHT.

39:48.857 --> 39:50.719
IT'S A LONG WAY TO HIKE

39:50.719 --> 39:52.861
FOR TWO WORDS YOU CAN SAY
ON THE PHONE.

39:52.861 --> 39:55.023
WELL, THEN WOULD YOU INDULGE ME
FOR A FEW MORE?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.868
I KNOW THAT DANIEL ONCE
FANCIED YOU

39:59.868 --> 40:01.930
AND THAT I WASN'T THE MOST
RECEPTIVE TO YOUR PRESENCE.

40:01.930 --> 40:03.932
(scoffs) YOU THINK?

40:03.932 --> 40:06.535
THAT'S BECAUSE
I DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND

40:06.535 --> 40:09.438
HOW IMPORTANT
HIS HAPPINESS WAS TO ME...

40:09.438 --> 40:11.810
EXCLUSIVE OF MY OWN.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.782
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

40:13.782 --> 40:15.844
THAT I THINK THAT YOU MAY
BE THE ONE FOR DANIEL.

40:15.844 --> 40:20.449
(huffs) DANIEL'S GETTING MARRIED
IN A MONTH.

40:20.449 --> 40:22.551
BUT YOU MUST HAVE STOPPED
TO WONDER

40:22.551 --> 40:26.825
IF THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE
HE LOST YOU THREE YEARS AGO.

40:28.557 --> 40:31.930
I KNOW THAT YOU AND I
DIDN'T GET ALONG IN THE PAST,

40:31.930 --> 40:33.832
BUT PERHAPS
WE COULD WORK TOGETHER

40:33.832 --> 40:36.064
TOWARDS A COMMON GOAL.

40:36.064 --> 40:37.506
HMM?

40:45.774 --> 40:48.877
MY MUSEUM FUND-RAISER'S
CANCELED.

40:48.877 --> 40:52.621
I IMAGINE I HAVE YOU
TO THANK FOR THAT.

40:52.621 --> 40:56.124
BIZZY WILL BE ANYTHING BUT
FOR A WHILE.
 THANKS.

40:56.124 --> 40:58.787
THOUGH WHEN IT WAS TIME
TO GO IN FOR THE KILL,

40:58.787 --> 41:00.088
I COULDN'T PULL THE TRIGGER.

41:00.088 --> 41:03.061
I ACTUALLY
SAVED HER MARRIAGE.

41:03.061 --> 41:07.195
GUESS MY TAKEDOWNS
HAVE A SILVER LINING, HUH?

41:07.195 --> 41:10.939
(sighs)

41:10.939 --> 41:12.000
(seagull cries)

41:12.000 --> 41:14.543
IT'S KIND OF FUN
BEING YOUR WINGMAN.

41:14.543 --> 41:15.744
(chuckles)

41:15.744 --> 41:17.846
I TAUGHT YOU WELL,
GRASSHOPPER.

41:19.778 --> 41:23.852
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
YOU DID, NOLAN.

41:23.852 --> 41:27.756
TWO YEARS AGO, I NEVER
WOULD'VE THOUGHT I'D HAVE

41:27.756 --> 41:31.590
A PARTNER IN ALL THIS...

41:31.590 --> 41:33.892
OR A REAL FRIEND.

41:38.196 --> 41:39.868
WELL, YOU, UH...

41:39.868 --> 41:41.700
(sets down glass)

41:41.700 --> 41:45.934
MIGHT WANNA WAIT
ON OUR FREEZE-FRAME HIGH FIVE.

41:45.934 --> 41:48.937
MY GLASSES ACCIDENTALLY
POCKET-RECORDED...
 (sets down glass)

41:48.937 --> 41:51.810
PORTIONS
OF LAST NIGHT'S PARTY.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.982
ALLOW ME TO JUMP
TO THE LOWLIGHT.

41:53.982 --> 41:55.213
(beeping)

41:55.213 --> 41:56.945
WAIT FOR IT...

42:01.049 --> 42:05.123
THAT'S WHY DANIEL WASN'T
UPSET ABOUT AIDEN.

42:05.123 --> 42:09.798
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ABOUT
TO REKINDLE THEIR PAST.

42:09.798 --> 42:12.861
THEN I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THEY HAVE NO FUTURE.
