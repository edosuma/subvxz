00:05.338 --> 00:07.090
<i>Hooch, let's tell them
what happened last week.</i>

00:07.173 --> 00:09.426
-What do you like to do for fun?
-I jog.

00:09.509 --> 00:12.262
We could jog together
with Hooch and Angel.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.180
-Yeah. How about Thursday?
-It's a date!

00:14.264 --> 00:15.598
-Okay.
-On the calendar.

00:15.682 --> 00:18.018
Scott? I thought that was you.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.894
Brooke! What-- What are you doing here?

00:19.978 --> 00:22.022
I just transferred
to the US Attorney's office here.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.482
-Now we work in the same building.
-Great.

00:25.316 --> 00:26.443
So that's her, huh?

00:26.526 --> 00:28.862
The ex you've been hung up on
for the past five years?

00:28.945 --> 00:30.488
<i>So, you know that Wyatt guy?</i>

00:30.572 --> 00:31.823
<i>The criminal from Dad's file.</i>

00:31.906 --> 00:33.199
I found his trailer.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.827
Laura, you're gonna talk to him yourself?
That's a bad idea.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.245
I'll come tomorrow. Okay?

00:37.328 --> 00:38.913
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.517
Stop, we just wanna talk to you.

00:59.601 --> 01:03.605
No! Get away! Leave me alone!

01:05.982 --> 01:09.110
We got off on the wrong foot!
Let's do a reset!

01:24.918 --> 01:26.711
-Come on!

01:33.760 --> 01:35.011
Stop!

01:45.647 --> 01:47.649
-I just wanna chat.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.779
You know, this is bull.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.740
You've got no right
chasing me and tackling me!

02:36.823 --> 02:40.660
You threw a frying pan through your window
at my head 'cause I knocked on your door.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.829
What was I supposed to do?
You've got this big old dog.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.040
-I was scared.
-Scared? Scared of what?

02:45.123 --> 02:46.958
Scared he was gonna drool
and flood the place?

02:47.042 --> 02:48.334
He's not Dogzilla.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.836
All right. We're not here to argue.

02:49.919 --> 02:51.463
Look, our father was Officer Turner.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.965
Before he died,
he was conducting an investigation,

02:54.049 --> 02:56.509
and your rap sheet showed up in his files.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.886
We just wanna know why.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.141
Also, trying to brain someone
with a frying pan?

03:03.224 --> 03:04.642
That's assault with a deadly weapon.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.519
So if you'd rather discuss this
with the police--

03:06.603 --> 03:08.730
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Look, hold up, okay?

03:11.066 --> 03:13.568
Your dad was after this guy, John,
I worked for a few times.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.278
Hired me to do some little stuff.

03:15.362 --> 03:19.657
Scare people. Break windows. Slash tires.
Set a small fire one time.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.242
Why did he want you to scare people?

03:21.326 --> 03:23.703
I think he was trying to buy their land
for cheap.

03:23.787 --> 03:26.122
Your dad made me tell him
the places John wanted me to hit.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.833
-I did, and he let me go.
-You know John's last name?

03:28.917 --> 03:32.837
No. It's like I told your dad,
he's just some slick dude in a suit.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.299
He found me at the Crusty Pirate.
Said I could make some extra cash.

03:36.383 --> 03:40.970
I did some jobs, got busted,
moved on to opportunities in the, uh...

03:42.013 --> 03:43.556
...pre-owned automotive space.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.974
-That's it.
-That's it?

03:45.058 --> 03:47.143
Our dad was investigating
a guy named John?

03:47.227 --> 03:50.730
His files have major criminals in them.
Gangsters. Drug traffickers.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.316
-If you are working with these guys--
-Yo, just back off, lady!

03:53.400 --> 03:54.776
Lady?

03:54.859 --> 03:58.822
How many criminal kingpins you know
get stuck with Aunt Gladys' old sofa, hmm?

03:58.905 --> 04:01.241
Look, I already told you.
I don't know anything.

04:02.534 --> 04:06.246
I believe him. That's the face of a guy
who doesn't know anything.

04:06.996 --> 04:07.997
Yeah, whatever.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.332
-Hold on-- That's it?

04:09.416 --> 04:11.751
I mean, aren't there tricks,
like good cop, bad cop?

04:11.835 --> 04:13.169
First of all, I'm not a cop.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.296
Secondly, it takes two cops
for good cop, bad cop.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.173
-Not a cop and a veterinary assistant.
-Okay.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.009
Plus,
I think he told us everything he knows.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.428
Then let's get Dad's records
and see if there's a John that--

04:21.511 --> 04:23.096
As in the most popular name in the world?

04:23.179 --> 04:25.181
No, I can't.
I got a big meeting with Brooke.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.809
-Wait, Brooke?
-Uh, the assistant US attorney.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.060
Oh, my God. "Brooke" Brooke.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.563
Like, the Brooke that launched
a thousand mopey playlists?

04:31.646 --> 04:33.815
-I thought she dumped you.
-She didn't dump me, okay?

04:33.898 --> 04:36.192
She got a job in New York,
where dreams are made.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.029
Anyway, it's strictly professional
and none of your business.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.155
-Okay, fine.
-Hey, hey.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.490
If you're gonna be professional
with your ex soul mate,

04:42.574 --> 04:44.200
I'll see if my ex can get us the records.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.661
What? Grady's a cop. He can help.

04:46.745 --> 04:50.707
Yeah, but doesn't stuff
between you guys get, like, messy?

04:50.790 --> 04:53.877
You're thinking of the old Laura.
I got this.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.253
I like the confidence.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.841
Don't be nervous.
It's just a meeting, right?

04:59.924 --> 05:02.218
She's just a regular old AUSA
like any other.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.596
With perfect hair and flawless skin.

05:04.679 --> 05:05.889
Who played tennis in college

05:05.972 --> 05:08.475
and spent her summers
teaching Somalian kids how to watercolor.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.851
-So, that's cool.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.228
I'm not nervous. You're nervous. No.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.522
-Scott.
-Hey.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.566
-Thanks for meeting me.
-Oh, my--

05:16.649 --> 05:19.694
-Oh.
-I'm sorry. My dog's v-very, um, moist.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.530
I think that's why they invented
the elbow bump.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.907
-Ah.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.660
I was so surprised when I heard
you were doing security on my trial.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.830
I know. It's so funny.
It's a funny coincidence.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.374
I-I didn't even know it was yours.

05:32.457 --> 05:36.044
Well, I-I hope it's okay.
I thought marshals hated court duty.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.087
Uh...

05:37.170 --> 05:40.674
Didn't Eleanor Roosevelt say, "You should
do something you hate every day"?

05:41.257 --> 05:43.968
This really smart girl I once knew
used to quote her all the time.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.053
Right.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.972
-You survived my women's studies phase.
-Yes.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.725
The summer of hairy pits and kombucha.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.103
-The kombucha was good.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.815
You sure this isn't gonna be awkward?
You know, given our history...

05:56.898 --> 05:58.858
Come on. It was so long ago.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.485
Okay, good.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.613
Uh... Just wanted to let you know
what you signed up for.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.949
It's a murder trial of a Mafia capo.

06:06.449 --> 06:10.412
There have been threats against the judge,
so he will need door-to-door protection.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.330
We can handle it. Who's the judge?

06:12.414 --> 06:14.457
Oh, you didn't know.
Uh, Judge Broderick Nelson.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.418
Judge Nelson.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.211
Huh.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.507
Forty years I've been on the bench.

06:22.590 --> 06:26.386
I don't need a babysitter.
Especially a Jonas brother.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.805
Scott Turner's an outstanding deputy.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.765
He'll put together a top-notch team.

06:30.849 --> 06:35.437
Team, huh? So him, that and what?
101 dalmatians?

06:36.187 --> 06:38.606
The K-9 unit
enhances door-to-door security.

06:38.690 --> 06:41.735
I have total confidence in them both,
as does the AUSA.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.070
Your Honor, the threat is real.
The FBI confirmed--

06:44.154 --> 06:45.655
Thank you, Taylor Swift.

06:46.614 --> 06:49.325
Any of these security experts here
born before the '90s?

06:49.409 --> 06:50.285
Eighty-eight.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.245
Sorry.

06:52.328 --> 06:56.541
Fine, do what you have to do.
Just don't get in my way.

06:56.624 --> 06:57.625
I won't.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.085
Unless I'm stopping a bullet for you.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.170
-Okay.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.633
Not sure why you volunteered for this,
Turner.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.762
-May God have mercy on your soul.
-Thank you.

07:11.222 --> 07:14.225
All right, buddy. This is Brooke's
big case. We gotta be wired tight.

07:14.309 --> 07:18.646
That means no licking shoes, no drooling.
Professional. Starting now.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.567
-Mmm.
-Wow.

07:22.650 --> 07:26.071
That's professional? I don't wanna see
what casual Friday looks like.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.197
Or sounds like.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.242
-Oh, God. Or smells like.
-It assaults the nostrils.

07:31.326 --> 07:34.537
Hey, uh, so I've got a job.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.457
Oh, I heard.
You need help with Judge Nelson?

07:37.540 --> 07:40.835
Yeah, I'd love to, but, yeah, the baby.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.380
And Chief says it's only desk duty
from here on out.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.090
You know, it's court security.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.550
Yeah, you ride in a car,
you sit in a courtroom.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.804
No bang-bang shoot-shoot.
Sit-sit, chill-chill. No?

07:50.887 --> 07:52.555
I just need a little help.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.684
Do you know he still
makes people pick up trash on the highway

07:55.767 --> 07:57.102
like he did as a state judge?

07:57.185 --> 08:00.522
Everyone's just too scared to tell him
federal judges can't do that.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.982
Come on. This is an important case.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.694
Yeah, important to you.

08:05.777 --> 08:09.572
I read the file.
Your ex-girlfriend's the AUSA.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.283
What's her name? Prosecutor Barbie?

08:12.367 --> 08:14.661
-It's Brooke. Prosecutor Brooke.
-Oh.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.997
And it's not about her. It's about
the judicial process. Heard of it?

08:18.081 --> 08:20.083
Hooch, you buying this?

08:21.751 --> 08:23.003
Yeah, me neither.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.671
Listen, Scott.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.007
Even if I wanted to, which I don't,

08:27.090 --> 08:29.759
the chief is convinced
I'm a bullet magnet.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.095
-He'd never approve it.
-Well, what am I supposed to do?

08:32.178 --> 08:34.472
I had to promise to change the oil
on Barrios's car

08:34.556 --> 08:37.058
and buy 15 boxes of candy bars
from Jenna's kid

08:37.142 --> 08:38.560
just to get a backup team.

08:39.185 --> 08:43.565
I need another deputy for the main detail,
and I-I've asked everyone else.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.608
Oh. Everyone?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.027
What about X?

08:51.114 --> 08:52.282
Everyone from Earth.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.493
Also, X has been a deputy for 15 years.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.162
He's not gonna wanna do court security

08:57.245 --> 08:59.164
with a guy who's been on the streets
a few months.

08:59.247 --> 09:03.209
Or you could just go to your ex-girlfriend
and beg off the case.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.295
I'm sure she'd think that was so hot.

09:05.879 --> 09:06.713
Fine.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.215
Come on, Hooch.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.393
-Hey, Turner.
-Sorry to interrupt whatever that is.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.272
You know, I know we don't talk a lot,

09:24.356 --> 09:28.360
but I'm doing court security,
and I need someone for the main detail.

09:28.443 --> 09:32.072
And before you say no, let me just say,
I will owe you forever.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.324
-Like, any job you need me for, I'm th--
-Sure.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.451
I mean, it's for Judge Nelson.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.497
-Is the dog in on this?
Yeah.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.376
And I know there have been incidents,
but we have been working tirelessly--

09:44.459 --> 09:45.418
Cool.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.296
I'm gonna learn a lot from you.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.674
You've got an old soul. I can tell.

09:52.634 --> 09:53.635
Wh--

09:54.678 --> 09:55.970
Reminds me of my grandpa.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.681
Yeah...

09:59.265 --> 10:03.103
So I'll send you the schedule,
and then we'll-- Okay, thank you.

10:06.147 --> 10:09.484
Okay, just gonna go
see your ex-husband.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.027
No big deal.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.988
Just get him to give you
Dad's police files.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.157
Find out about this John guy.

10:17.325 --> 10:20.203
Gonna keep it short.
Gonna keep it professional.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.540
You can do this.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.378
Dad, look out!
-You got it. You got it. Go, go, go.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.339
-Oh!
-Grady? Hello! The door's unlocked.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.383
Yeah, so I don't have to pause
for the pizza guy.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.718
Or an ax murderer.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.429
Can we stay for pizza, Mom?

10:37.512 --> 10:41.182
Hello to you too, son that I birthed.
And, no, I have to study. Get your stuff.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.767
Aw.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.522
Um, hey, can you pause this for a second?
I have a favor to ask.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.567
-Go for it. I'm all about multitasking.
-It's about my dad.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.403
I was hoping you could get some records
from his last investigation

10:53.486 --> 10:54.571
from the police station.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.740
And I thought while you were at work,
you could--

10:56.823 --> 10:59.242
Oh, come on! What am I doing wrong here?

10:59.325 --> 11:02.704
You can't beat this level alone.
You need someone to watch your six.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.581
You know I do. Get your controller.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.959
I mean, if your mom says it's okay.

11:08.460 --> 11:11.254
-Grady, I literally just said--
-Dad needs help, Mom.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.883
-You always say to put family first.
-Nice.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.384
You do say that.

11:17.469 --> 11:19.220
Okay, just until you beat
this level though.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.305
Yes!

11:21.723 --> 11:23.016
You could play too, Mom.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.852
He's right.
We will win faster with three players.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.148
That's what you get
for messing with Mommy!

11:30.231 --> 11:32.025
-Boom!
-I used my aura.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.318
There you go.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.574
-Holy bruise!
-Don't you lose me!

11:39.657 --> 11:41.785
-All right. It's right behind me!
-Eat it!

11:41.868 --> 11:44.162
-Oh, there he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

11:45.955 --> 11:47.832
-You need a fourth?
-Yeah!

11:49.918 --> 11:52.128
Walter. Walter! Up.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.213
Hey!
-Hi!

11:53.296 --> 11:55.256
Thank you for doing this
on such short notice.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.842
I, uh, I remember you said
you liked chocolate.

11:57.926 --> 12:01.763
Ah, cool! I've actually been trying
to train myself with chocolate,

12:01.846 --> 12:04.015
like the same way I train dogs
with treats.

12:04.099 --> 12:07.894
So far I've trained myself
to eat a lot of chocolate.

12:08.645 --> 12:09.938
But it's still early.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.357
Well, you run out,
I got ten more boxes in my trunk.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.525
Uh, like I said on the phone,

12:13.608 --> 12:15.944
I need Hooch
for a judicial protection detail.

12:16.027 --> 12:19.656
Right. Okay, so about K-9 protection,
it covers a lot.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.368
Do you wanna start
with explosives training? Attack training?

12:23.451 --> 12:26.913
Yeah, I think we might wanna
set our sights a bit lower.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.123
I just need to make sure

12:28.206 --> 12:30.417
he doesn't try to get a belly rub
from the defendant.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.752
-I just-- I really need this to go well.

12:33.712 --> 12:38.466
Okay. I say we start with focus.
Keeping his attention where you direct it.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.135
Well, I-- I don't know if that's Hooch.

12:40.218 --> 12:43.722
Oh, sure, it is. You know how a dog looks
where a human is pointing?

12:43.805 --> 12:47.058
They're one of the only animals
that can do that. It's amazing.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.184
Hooch, look!

12:49.227 --> 12:53.398
Look at the door.
Good. Now look at Scott. Good.

12:54.232 --> 12:58.486
Just directing his attention.
You try. Your focus is his focus.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.280
Okay. Hooch, look.

13:01.156 --> 13:02.449
Look at the chair.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.411
Yeah.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.580
-Try something else? Okay.
-Yeah. Just switch it up.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.832
Hooch, look at the door.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.755
Hoo-- Oh. Okay, sure. Look at Erica.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.507
Now he's directing my attention
'cause I'm looking at you.

13:24.262 --> 13:27.474
You'll get it.
You're so good-looking--

13:27.557 --> 13:30.894
Good at looking for things.
Like keys. You ever lose your keys?

13:30.977 --> 13:33.313
I lose my keys so much
that I trained Angel to find them.

13:33.396 --> 13:34.439
-Huh.
-Do you wanna see?

13:34.522 --> 13:36.649
-Angel! Keys. Watch this.

13:36.733 --> 13:37.776
Oh.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.152
-Oh.
-Here they are. Pants.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.988
Yep, that's where they are.
They were just there in my pants.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.490
-Yeah.
-What a weird place for them.

13:43.573 --> 13:46.868
Anyways, good look-- Luck. Good luck!

13:46.951 --> 13:48.328
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.526
Morning. So I planned our route.
If we leave here by 7:30--

14:19.609 --> 14:20.944
You changed your hair gel.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.779
-What's that about?
-Nothing.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.198
No one changes their hair gel for nothing.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.242
Maybe we should focus.
I have an itinerary.

14:27.325 --> 14:30.537
Itineraries are two-dimensional.
I like to approach a case holistically.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.830
You know, take in everything.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.623
But my hair gel doesn't have
anything to do--

14:33.707 --> 14:35.166
You tied a double Windsor too.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.376
-Are you trying to impress someone?
-No.

14:36.459 --> 14:37.627
-Is it me?
-No.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.879
-The judge?
-I'm not trying to impress anyone, okay?

14:39.963 --> 14:42.966
Ju-- I-- I have an itinerary.

14:47.971 --> 14:52.225
Judge expected you five minutes ago.
May God have mercy on your soul.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.727
Why do people keep saying that?

14:54.227 --> 14:57.272
-Good morning, Your Honor.
-It was a good morning five minutes ago.

14:57.355 --> 14:58.565
Now it's a fiasco.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.151
I assure you, sir,
we have more than enough time.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.695
-Not if you include my errands.
-Errands?

15:03.778 --> 15:07.115
A crazy thing my generation does
where we go to actual stores

15:07.198 --> 15:09.242
and get things in person.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.245
Well, sir,
any unplanned route does increase risk.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.123
Risk? Try me without coffee.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.003
Let's get the judge coffee.

15:26.843 --> 15:29.929
Xavier, what's your status?
Is the situation under control?

15:30.847 --> 15:34.184
<i>That's a negative.
Situation is deteriorating rapidly.</i>

15:34.768 --> 15:38.938
This is not light starch! It's heavy!
I can tell the difference!

15:44.319 --> 15:46.696
Deputy Marshal Turner.
<i>Hey! It's me.</i>

15:46.780 --> 15:48.656
What happened to your voice?
Are you getting sick?

15:48.740 --> 15:51.951
Uh, no. No.
It's, uh, weird.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.871
Okay. Just, uh, checking
everything's okay.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.748
Um, court's about to start.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.501
Yeah, we're almost there.
We, uh, we had a couple detours.

15:59.584 --> 16:02.962
You know, forget the mob, I'm pretty sure
every barista and clerk in town

16:03.046 --> 16:04.506
wants to kill Judge Nelson.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.925
<i>Scott, I know Nelson can be tough,</i>

16:07.008 --> 16:09.761
but I just feel a lot better
knowing you're on detail

16:09.844 --> 16:11.388
<i>and everything's under control.</i>

16:11.471 --> 16:13.682
I can't believe they tried to fool me
with the light stuff.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.809
-Sorry. One sec.
-Like I wouldn't know the difference!

16:15.892 --> 16:17.936
-And where's my damn doughnut?
-One Boston cream doughnut.

16:19.437 --> 16:20.522
That's powdered sugar.

16:20.605 --> 16:24.192
Boston cream has chocolate.
That's Bavarian cream!

16:26.152 --> 16:27.153
Duly noted.

16:27.237 --> 16:28.488
<i>Scott? Scott?</i>
-Sorry.

16:28.571 --> 16:31.741
Uh, yeah, under control.
Everything. I-- I'll see you soon.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.326
Okay, we gotta roll.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.913
We'll guard the exits,
monitor the gallery,

16:36.996 --> 16:39.165
and I'll be posted next to you
for added protection.

16:39.249 --> 16:42.585
Let me make something clear.
A courtroom needs order.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.087
Disturb that order,

16:44.170 --> 16:47.465
and you'll mull the error of your ways
picking up trash by the highway.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.384
-Understood?
-Understood.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.469
I appreciate the need for order, sir,

16:51.553 --> 16:55.348
but technically a federal judge
can't order people to pick up trash.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.433
Oh, really?

16:56.516 --> 16:59.019
Perhaps you'd like to argue
this bit of constitutional law

16:59.102 --> 17:01.563
in front of one of my colleagues
in federal court?

17:02.439 --> 17:04.649
Good choice, Nick Jonas.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.735
And this animal...

17:06.818 --> 17:08.028
Is it gonna be a problem?

17:08.611 --> 17:12.157
No, sir. He's, um,
he's trained for security work.

17:12.991 --> 17:16.077
Hooch, look.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.669
That's more like it.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.090
Better late than never.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.968
The government will prove

17:32.052 --> 17:34.888
that the defendant, Mr. Bianchi,
is guilty of murder.

17:35.472 --> 17:39.184
We have overwhelming law enforcement
surveillance video and audio

17:39.267 --> 17:41.144
confirming his culpability.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.188
So why not plead guilty?

17:44.147 --> 17:45.315
Simple.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.568
He wants to frighten and intimidate
those who seek justice.

17:51.154 --> 17:54.532
Smirk again in my courtroom,
and you'll be sorry.

17:54.616 --> 17:57.994
-You're the one that's gonna be sorry.
-Sir, you are in contempt.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.080
You got no idea what I'm capable of.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.374
Counselors, in my chambers, now!

18:05.543 --> 18:09.422
-Your Honor, my client meant nothing.
-Oh, I know what he meant.

18:09.881 --> 18:12.258
He speaks again,
he'll be in cuffs and leg irons.

18:12.342 --> 18:13.968
This dog is better behaved.

18:14.969 --> 18:19.015
That is an insult to my client
and to Italian-Americans everywhere.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.351
Your Honor,
Mr. Bianchi's words were direct threats.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.353
He's just a man
who speaks his mind.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.106
-The counsel is hysterical.
-Hysterical?

18:26.189 --> 18:28.274
Setting aside that sexist dog whistle,

18:28.358 --> 18:31.569
counsel is appropriately concerned
with the judge's safety.

18:31.653 --> 18:32.570
Agreed.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.116
Mr. Mancuso,
unless you want your client in solitary,

18:36.199 --> 18:39.369
I suggest you start showing the prosecutor
and the judge a little respect.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.174
You still looking at my hair gel?

18:53.258 --> 18:55.760
-Yes.
Can you stop?

18:55.844 --> 18:58.179
I know you have this whole
"holistic approach" or whatever,

18:58.263 --> 19:00.598
but I assure you,
it has nothing to do with our job.

19:00.682 --> 19:02.892
-And you're sure about that?
-Yeah, I'm absolutely sure.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.144
Can we be sure of anything?

19:04.853 --> 19:07.355
You know, it's not the answers, Scott.
It's the questions.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.734
I have a question. Can we just put
the philosophy aside for a second, okay?

19:10.817 --> 19:13.028
We have, like,
a really important job to do here.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.280
<i>May I please take your order?</i>

19:15.363 --> 19:18.700
Hi, can we get three chicken tacos,
please?

19:18.783 --> 19:23.413
With Monterey Jack cheese, not cheddar,
on two corn tortillas, one flour,

19:23.496 --> 19:27.792
in a bag labeled
"Judge only. Do not touch."

19:31.838 --> 19:33.006
Per your request.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.263
Where's the extra hot sauce?

19:41.014 --> 19:44.309
Extra hot sauce is on its way.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.606
-Hey, how's it going?
-Hey.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.775
I just spoke to the chief
about Bianchi's threat.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.526
Already on it. I've doubled up security.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.612
I've got deputies
on the judge's house 24-7,

19:55.695 --> 19:57.822
and starting tomorrow,
we're gonna take alternate routes

19:57.906 --> 19:59.199
<i>to and from the courthouse.</i>

19:59.282 --> 20:00.867
Wow, that's amazing.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.870
Well, you know, it's, uh, what I
trained for. Thinking of every angle.

20:03.953 --> 20:07.123
Judge's tacos are getting cold.
We gotta roll on that hot sauce.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.208
<i>What's that?</i>

20:08.291 --> 20:09.542
-Hot sauce?
<i>Nothing.</i>

20:09.626 --> 20:10.877
It's nothing.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.172
Yeah, it's actually marshal lingo.
"Hot sauce" means, uh, security threat.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.256
So I should go.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.304
It's for the prosecutor, isn't it?
The hair gel?

20:21.388 --> 20:23.848
Okay, fine.
Yeah, it is a little bit for her.

20:24.474 --> 20:27.811
We knew each other a long time ago.
We dated a little bit.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.480
And I don't know,
I just wanted to look nice.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.107
You do look very nice.

20:32.774 --> 20:33.900
Thank you.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.277
Now, why's it so important
to impress the prosecutor?

20:37.862 --> 20:42.033
Not that it's any of your business,
but, um, you know, when we were dating,

20:42.117 --> 20:45.620
I was like this low-level admin
and she was this big, fancy lawyer.

20:45.704 --> 20:48.498
And I wanted to show her
things are different now.

20:48.581 --> 20:53.086
Now I'm wasting my time picking up
hot sauce for a tyrant in a robe.

20:53.169 --> 20:56.047
No such thing as a waste of time.
Every moment matters.

20:56.131 --> 20:59.175
You know, one time I was out by myself
and this wave was coming at me--

20:59.259 --> 21:01.344
And you surfed the wave
and something profound happened.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.221
-Am I right?
-No, not that kind of wave.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.890
It was a wave
of insurgents in Afghanistan.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.018
Oh. Um, I--

21:08.101 --> 21:10.562
I guess in that situation
every moment does matter.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.147
And I remember thinking to myself,

21:12.230 --> 21:17.360
"If I live, I will waste no experience,
no second of my life."

21:18.028 --> 21:19.946
Which is very wise.

21:20.030 --> 21:23.158
And I-I don't mean
to take anything away from that,

21:23.658 --> 21:28.163
but we're currently picking up hot sauce
at a drive-through.

21:29.539 --> 21:30.540
Hi.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.752
-You really like hot sauce.
-Yeah.

21:37.630 --> 21:41.718
-Got us some extra. Just in case.
In case of what?

21:42.510 --> 21:44.637
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.189
-You still here?
-Yeah.

21:54.731 --> 21:56.483
Just finishing time sheets.

21:57.067 --> 21:59.903
Remember to convert yours to dog years,
Hooch.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.113
You know, ten hours of overtime

22:02.197 --> 22:04.532
for driving a judge
back and forth from work.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.868
I'm the world's
most expensive Uber.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.579
And I can't even rate the judge
'cause I'd give him zero stars.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.831
Ouch. Hooch behaving himself?

22:12.999 --> 22:14.709
Actually, he's been perfect.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.045
Like, weirdly perfect.

22:17.128 --> 22:19.422
For once, I have no issues with my dog.

22:20.173 --> 22:25.220
Uh, Xavier, on the other hand, wh--
What is this guy's deal?

22:25.303 --> 22:26.346
You could learn--

22:26.429 --> 22:29.140
"...a lot from him."
Yes, you keep saying that.

22:29.224 --> 22:30.517
And you keep ignoring it.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.852
What is supposed
to be so impressive, exactly?

22:32.936 --> 22:35.647
-His, um, his obsession with condiments...

22:35.730 --> 22:38.316
...or his keen observation of my hairstyle?

22:38.400 --> 22:40.860
-That is a lot of gel.
-It's been a very long day.

22:40.944 --> 22:42.404
Yeah, and not one strand is outta place.

22:42.987 --> 22:47.659
Listen, Scott, I know Xavier has
his own way of doing things,

22:47.742 --> 22:50.537
but just try to keep an open mind, okay?

22:50.620 --> 22:51.788
Okay.

22:52.497 --> 22:54.165
It's open. It's open.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.127
-Hey, Laur.
<i>-Hey, Scotty.</i>

22:57.210 --> 23:00.046
<i>Just leaving work.
Any luck getting Dad's records from Grady?</i>

23:00.130 --> 23:02.298
Well, it's been kinda complicated.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.300
Complicated? Just ask for them.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.261
It's Grady.

23:06.344 --> 23:09.014
I spent six hours searching
for alien overlords.

23:09.597 --> 23:11.975
-I finally got 'em.
-W-Wait. So you got the records?

23:12.559 --> 23:13.935
No, the alien overlords.

23:14.519 --> 23:16.980
Ugh. Gosh! You know, I was so focused.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.024
But then he did that thing
that he always does,

23:19.107 --> 23:21.860
where he uses Matthew to guilt me
into doing stuff.

23:21.943 --> 23:25.030
And before I know it, it's like I'm
in my early 20s just wasting my life away.

23:25.113 --> 23:27.657
Now I'm late studying
for the vet tech exam,

23:27.741 --> 23:30.535
and I'm out of milk
for the mac and cheese.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.162
And the records?

23:32.245 --> 23:35.415
Oh, Grady says he's gonna poke around
at work and get back to me.

23:35.498 --> 23:36.499
Hey, Scott.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.043
<i>What if I'm not strong enough?</i>

23:38.126 --> 23:40.712
What if being a princess
at the Cypress Beach Guacamole Festival

23:40.795 --> 23:42.464
is all I'm ever gonna amount to?

23:42.547 --> 23:45.383
Five minutes with Grady,
and I turn into a slacker.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.761
<i>Laura, listen to me, okay?</i>

23:47.844 --> 23:51.473
You are strong.
You're capable. You can do this.

23:51.556 --> 23:53.016
Just replace the milk with water.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.728
Right, yeah. Strong. Capable.

23:57.228 --> 23:59.189
Water! Shoot!

24:00.482 --> 24:01.691
Sorry, Scotty. I gotta go.

24:02.275 --> 24:04.861
<i>-Oh, no. My vet study book.</i>
-Is everything okay?

24:05.820 --> 24:06.863
Whoo-hoo.

24:06.946 --> 24:10.784
Loving this power walk.
It is so much easier than jogging.

24:10.867 --> 24:13.119
Yeah. Thanks for coming.
It's good to have the company.

24:13.203 --> 24:14.746
-You wanna rest, or--
-Yes, rest.

24:14.829 --> 24:16.081
-Yeah?
-That's a great idea.

24:16.164 --> 24:18.500
-Just a little rest.
-Yeah.

24:20.293 --> 24:21.544
Your hair is different.

24:22.587 --> 24:25.924
Oh, and your skin too. Did you exfoliate?

24:26.007 --> 24:30.553
Uh, the, uh... The-- The judge
I'm protecting's big on appearances.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.013
-Oh.
-Yeah.

24:32.097 --> 24:33.390
That's unusual.

24:33.473 --> 24:35.225
Actually, about that. Um...

24:35.308 --> 24:37.394
I wanted to thank you
for your help with Hooch.

24:37.977 --> 24:41.064
He has been amazing. Just totally focused.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.399
That's so great.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.276
For once, he just gets it.
Hey, watch this.

24:45.777 --> 24:47.070
Hooch, look.

24:47.570 --> 24:48.905
Oh.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.448
Hooch, no!
-Oh!

24:50.532 --> 24:52.283
Sorry! He's friendly. Kinda.

24:52.867 --> 24:56.371
It's so weird.
I-I swear he was perfect for the judge.

24:56.913 --> 24:59.165
Did he forget,
or is he just messing with me?

24:59.249 --> 25:00.875
No, I don't think he's messing with you.

25:00.959 --> 25:03.169
Um, maybe you were just
focused on the judge.

25:03.253 --> 25:07.382
You know, dogs always pay attention
to what their owners pay attention to.

25:07.465 --> 25:08.591
Right.

25:11.302 --> 25:14.639
Yeah, but not always.
I mean, Angel's not watching me

25:14.723 --> 25:15.932
-because you're pay--
-No.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.351
Obviously.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.521
Well, I should probably get back to work.

25:21.604 --> 25:22.981
-I'll get Hooch.
-Okay.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.108
Angel.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.402
Seriously? Be cool.

25:27.485 --> 25:29.571
Hi. Sorry. Hey, bud.

25:29.654 --> 25:31.031
Buh-bye.

25:31.114 --> 25:33.199
I know. Just--

25:34.325 --> 25:38.371
Grady, I spent an entire afternoon
with you blasting aliens into plasma.

25:38.455 --> 25:40.582
-You said you would get the records.
-And I will.

25:40.665 --> 25:42.125
I mean, I am. They're in storage.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.752
I had to sign a form. It's a whole thing.

25:43.835 --> 25:45.128
Watch me, Dad.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.255
Sweet, buddy!
-Careful.

25:47.339 --> 25:50.383
Okay, so then why couldn't you
just call me and tell me?

25:50.467 --> 25:52.010
I thought you'd want to hear in person.

25:52.093 --> 25:55.347
Besides, thought maybe the little man
would want to get some breakfast.

25:55.430 --> 25:57.349
Really? Awesome.

25:57.432 --> 26:00.101
No. No, no, no. I have to go to work.
I have things to do.

26:00.185 --> 26:01.978
Matt-Matty, tell your mom she can be late.

26:02.062 --> 26:03.104
Come on. It's breakfast.

26:03.188 --> 26:05.774
You always do that.
You can't just use Matthew against me.

26:05.857 --> 26:06.733
I'm not.

26:06.816 --> 26:09.235
Hey, Matthew.
I'm not using you against your mom, am I?

26:09.736 --> 26:13.198
It's not Dad's fault, Mom.
You just never want to do fun stuff.

26:13.281 --> 26:15.909
It's just errands and work.

26:15.992 --> 26:18.787
What about yesterday?
Didn't we play video games all day?

26:18.870 --> 26:21.414
Sure.
But that's only because we were here.

26:21.498 --> 26:23.875
-It's always fun at Dad's.

26:25.668 --> 26:28.004
Okay, fine. Let's get breakfast!

26:28.088 --> 26:29.673
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

26:30.340 --> 26:31.341
Here you go.

26:31.841 --> 26:34.928
-We are not BMX-ing.
-You gotta work up an appetite.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.515
-Oh, my...
-Hyah.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.642
-Saddle up, partner.
Mom, hi.

26:40.725 --> 26:43.436
Yeah, I'm gonna be a little late
to the clinic this morning.

26:46.314 --> 26:49.275
I believe this building has
a perfectly good front door.

26:49.359 --> 26:50.360
I'm aware of that, sir.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.278
But the defendant
threatened you yesterday.

26:52.362 --> 26:55.198
If he's got someone after you,
they'll be watching the front.

26:55.281 --> 26:58.493
So I get to follow up my breakfast
with a nice stroll by the dumpster?

26:58.576 --> 27:01.621
You. Sunglasses.
You really think this is necessary?

27:01.705 --> 27:04.666
Agent Turner's not wrong.
The streets are wide open.

27:04.749 --> 27:06.334
What are we actually worried about?

27:06.418 --> 27:10.005
Oh. Am I going to get shot by a sniper
if I'm not in a filthy alley?

27:10.088 --> 27:13.049
-We're in Bogotá now?
-With all due respect, sir, it's possible.

27:13.133 --> 27:16.344
Any of these tall structures
could be a sniper location.

27:16.428 --> 27:19.055
That rooftop over there, for example.
Or that parking gar--

27:21.224 --> 27:23.309
Shooter! Everyone, down!

27:30.692 --> 27:33.862
Support team, we have an active shooter
in the parking garage at Orange and Polk!

27:33.945 --> 27:35.196
Requesting backup!

27:38.116 --> 27:39.909
-Sir, are you okay?
-It's "Your Honor"!

27:39.993 --> 27:40.994
Your Honor, are you okay?

27:41.077 --> 27:44.539
No! I am not okay!
There's rancid Chinese food back here.

27:44.622 --> 27:47.751
-I'm sorry, Your Honor!
-Then I suggest you do something!

27:48.543 --> 27:49.544
Go, go.

27:55.008 --> 27:57.427
I think he's gone! Everyone okay?

27:58.303 --> 28:00.138
You've got to be kidding me.

28:02.098 --> 28:05.226
Unfortunately, it appears the sniper
got away before backup arrived.

28:05.310 --> 28:07.020
Which leaves us with exactly zero.

28:07.645 --> 28:09.397
What-- What's that-- What is that smell?

28:09.481 --> 28:12.150
-It's-- It's lo mein, sir.
-I can confirm that.

28:12.901 --> 28:14.319
-Lo mein?
-Lo mein.

28:14.402 --> 28:16.571
Might have been a thinner noodle.
A chow mein, perhaps.

28:16.654 --> 28:17.572
Equally as delicious.

28:18.948 --> 28:22.369
What we do know is
that this was a sophisticated attack.

28:22.452 --> 28:25.163
The sniper probably worked
for the Bianchi family.

28:25.246 --> 28:27.957
-We're dealing with a pro.
-Could use a pro or two ourselves.

28:28.750 --> 28:32.379
You led me right into the line of fire.
What kind of idiot does that?

28:32.462 --> 28:35.215
I assure you, Your Honor,
that was the safest route.

28:35.298 --> 28:36.841
Are you arguing with me?

28:36.925 --> 28:40.053
-No, no, I'm just pointing out--
Go ahead.

28:40.136 --> 28:43.223
Keep arguing. I dare you.

28:46.267 --> 28:47.435
You know--

28:49.187 --> 28:51.856
I risked my life for that guy.
And Hooch's!

28:51.940 --> 28:54.818
We should be figuring out
how that sniper knew our location,

28:54.901 --> 28:56.945
instead of being forced
to volunteer and pick up--

28:57.028 --> 29:00.323
Is that a diaper, Hooch?
Gross! Put it down!

29:02.784 --> 29:05.745
-You seem upset.
-Oh, do I? Yeah.

29:05.829 --> 29:09.416
I'm upset because this is upsetting.

29:09.499 --> 29:11.751
You think the prosecutor won't
be impressed with you now?

29:11.835 --> 29:15.213
Why wouldn't she be, right?
Yeah, I'm sure she'd be really wowed

29:15.296 --> 29:19.050
by my skills at picking up beer cans
and putting them in orange buckets!

29:20.885 --> 29:24.848
I know it's hard to see,
but it's like riding a wave.

29:24.931 --> 29:28.685
You feel the way a case wants to take you,
and you go with it.

29:29.644 --> 29:31.604
We're on the verge of something.
I can feel it.

29:31.688 --> 29:35.275
No! No!
No, we're not on the verge of anything.

29:35.358 --> 29:37.360
Look, I don't know
what planet you're from, bro,

29:37.444 --> 29:40.030
but I've had enough
of your weird surfer wisdom.

29:40.113 --> 29:43.575
There's no lesson to be learned
from getting extra hot sauce, dude.

29:43.658 --> 29:45.702
Prying filth from my dog's mouth

29:45.785 --> 29:48.997
is not the universe trying
to guide me to anything.

29:49.873 --> 29:52.542
This is how it always feels
right before the wave breaks.

29:52.625 --> 29:53.835
Then everything comes together.

29:53.918 --> 29:56.880
Stop it. Stop talking. Shh.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.131
Stop it.

29:58.798 --> 30:01.009
Where are you getting those diapers?

30:09.142 --> 30:11.811
That's it. I'm getting you out of here.

30:13.063 --> 30:15.899
Erica, it's Scott.
I need a really huge favor.

30:19.778 --> 30:20.779
Check it out!

30:21.363 --> 30:23.073
Awesome, Dad!

30:23.156 --> 30:24.199
Yeah.

30:24.282 --> 30:26.618
Whoo!

30:26.701 --> 30:28.495
Aren't you glad we rode bikes?

30:28.995 --> 30:30.830
Couple more miles,
and those pancakes are gone.

30:31.831 --> 30:34.542
-That garbage truck almost took me out.
Nice!

30:34.626 --> 30:35.668
It really wasn't.

30:35.752 --> 30:37.212
Still. Up high.

30:37.796 --> 30:39.547
No, no. It's time for us to go home.

30:39.631 --> 30:42.842
-Mom, no. Dad's gonna make waffles.
-Yeah.

30:42.926 --> 30:46.012
But we just had pan--
Put your bike away. Get your stuff.

30:46.096 --> 30:47.972
Just go.

30:50.308 --> 30:51.559
What's the rush?

30:52.352 --> 30:55.397
It's been two hours.
I'm late for work. I'm sweaty.

30:55.480 --> 30:59.609
And-- And my butt hurts from this stupid,
miniature circus-clown bike.

30:59.693 --> 31:01.653
It's not a clown bike. It's a BMX.

31:01.736 --> 31:03.279
So you can do bunny hops
without hitting your--

31:03.363 --> 31:04.739
Do you have the records or not?

31:04.823 --> 31:06.032
Okay.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.578
-It looks like he's got 'em.
-Great.

31:10.662 --> 31:11.913
They're on microfiche.

31:12.872 --> 31:16.668
Microfiche went out in the 1980s.
What date did you give him?

31:16.751 --> 31:18.962
2018. I wrote it on my arm.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.046
And then?

31:20.130 --> 31:22.924
And then I--
And then I went boogie boarding.

31:24.050 --> 31:28.179
And it may have smeared.
Okay! That's on me.

31:28.263 --> 31:29.472
I have an idea.

31:29.556 --> 31:32.434
I'll fix the thing with the records,
and then we'll have a second breakfast.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.019
-Waffle bar!
Yeah!

31:34.102 --> 31:35.895
-No.
-What? Why not?

31:35.979 --> 31:37.522
Because someone has to be the grown-up.

31:37.605 --> 31:39.607
He hasn't done his homework
or had vegetables in days.

31:40.191 --> 31:41.776
Grady, you cannot do this to me again.

31:41.860 --> 31:44.404
-Do what?
-Create a situation which I can't win.

31:44.487 --> 31:45.989
You come up with some fun idea,

31:46.072 --> 31:48.450
and I have to say yes,
or I'm the mean parent.

31:48.533 --> 31:52.328
-I thought you liked to have fun.
-I do, but I'm not 22 anymore, okay?

31:52.412 --> 31:56.207
Life is more than just fun and games
and shoes that look like gloves.

31:59.252 --> 32:00.086
High five.

32:00.170 --> 32:02.297
Get the records now!

32:06.092 --> 32:07.635
These shoes are awesome.

32:10.388 --> 32:12.015
Animal safety emergency.

32:12.515 --> 32:14.434
Thank you for coming.
I gotta get him out of here

32:14.517 --> 32:16.478
before he eats all the garbage
from here to Marin.

32:16.561 --> 32:17.395
No problem.

32:17.479 --> 32:20.565
So, I guess the judge-protecting thing
didn't go so well?

32:20.648 --> 32:21.733
Not really.

32:21.816 --> 32:24.110
Yeah, about that.
I was thinking about what you said

32:24.194 --> 32:26.237
about how Hooch was paying attention
to the judge--

32:26.321 --> 32:27.614
It doesn't matter anymore.

32:27.697 --> 32:30.450
I'm off the assignment.
The judge put the chief on it personally.

32:30.533 --> 32:31.534
Oh.

32:31.618 --> 32:35.330
But still, it's good to just know
why a dog acts weird.

32:35.413 --> 32:39.042
And I was wondering if you remember
when Hooch started focusing on the judge.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.795
-You know, when he saw Judge Nelson.
-It was after that.

32:42.671 --> 32:45.465
Hooch didn't focus
until after Nelson put on his robe.

32:46.633 --> 32:48.718
Actually, you're right. Why would that be?

32:48.802 --> 32:51.346
Could be so many things. The smell. Sound.

32:51.429 --> 32:55.141
Even basic electronics make
an ultrasonic sound only dogs can hear.

32:55.892 --> 32:56.893
Wait a second.

32:58.436 --> 33:01.564
Xavier, when we went to pick up the
judge's robe, you remember the window?

33:01.648 --> 33:05.402
I can't believe they'd pass off heavy
starch as light to a judge of my stature.

33:05.485 --> 33:07.028
Like I wouldn't know the difference.

33:10.031 --> 33:12.242
It was broken.
Like someone robbed the place.

33:12.909 --> 33:15.286
What if someone broke in
to put something on the judge's robe?

33:15.370 --> 33:17.664
A listening device or a tracker.

33:18.498 --> 33:20.041
That would be how the sniper found us!

33:20.125 --> 33:22.335
Guess it's a good thing
Hooch ate that diaper.

33:22.919 --> 33:25.380
Not what I meant.
That's just a coincidence!

33:25.463 --> 33:27.090
-Can we use your car?
-Yes!

33:27.173 --> 33:28.174
Thank you.

33:30.135 --> 33:32.595
Jess? Jess, it's Scott. Give me the chief.

33:32.679 --> 33:33.805
I can't.

33:33.888 --> 33:37.434
He's radio silent for security reasons.
It's just the chief and the judge.

33:37.517 --> 33:40.562
-Well, then put me through to the court.
-No can do. They just adjourned.

33:40.645 --> 33:42.731
Jess, they're in danger. Get them now!

33:42.814 --> 33:44.441
Hey, hey! You can't just leave!

34:07.589 --> 34:08.798
They couldn't have gotten far.

34:08.882 --> 34:11.634
I don't see the chief or Nelson.
They could be anywhere.

34:12.010 --> 34:13.219
W-Wait, I have an idea.

34:13.303 --> 34:16.014
If the judge has a bug on him,
how far away can Hooch hear him?

34:16.097 --> 34:17.891
Depends on the frequency, but pretty far.

34:17.974 --> 34:20.810
Okay. Hooch, where's your friend?
Go find the funny noise, okay?

34:20.894 --> 34:23.396
-Go find the mean judge. Go find him!

34:23.480 --> 34:26.149
Where is he? Find him.
Find him. Let's go. Let's go!

34:26.232 --> 34:28.568
-This is exciting!
-Clear the way!

34:28.651 --> 34:29.986
US Marshals!

34:30.070 --> 34:34.866
Sorry! Sorry, it's my first chase.
I'm so sorry! Cute top!

34:38.787 --> 34:40.455
-Down! Take cover!
-Get down! Down, down, down!

34:42.248 --> 34:43.750
I'm just a dog trainer!

34:47.921 --> 34:49.130
He's up there!

34:55.845 --> 34:58.139
-What are you doing?
-Saving your stupid life!

34:58.973 --> 35:00.266
He's on the move!

35:00.350 --> 35:03.019
I'll cover the judge.
You and the dog got this, Turner?

35:06.189 --> 35:09.609
NorCal ComCenter, Judge Nelson's
security detail is under fire.

35:09.693 --> 35:12.070
We have an active shooter
at the construction site parking garage

35:12.153 --> 35:12.987
at Elm and Third.

35:13.071 --> 35:14.739
-Scott!
-I do not have a visual.

35:14.823 --> 35:17.617
I need USMS personnel to respond
to our location and surround the plaza--

35:17.701 --> 35:19.661
-I have an idea. The receiver!
-What?

35:19.744 --> 35:21.162
If Hooch could hear the transmitter,

35:21.246 --> 35:22.997
then he could probably hear
the receiver too.

35:23.081 --> 35:25.333
-Whatever the assassin is using--
-He could lead us to him.

35:25.417 --> 35:26.835
-Yes!
-You're brilliant!

35:29.462 --> 35:31.423
Hooch, go find
the other funny noise, right?

35:31.506 --> 35:33.341
Find the other funny noise
and the other mean man.

35:35.051 --> 35:36.928
Erica. Erica, stay with them.
Sniper, remember?

35:37.012 --> 35:39.389
Right, sorry. Be careful.

35:41.057 --> 35:42.350
This is so exciting!

35:42.434 --> 35:43.893
-Get down!

35:45.854 --> 35:48.314
Where is he, Hooch? Where is he?
Find him, boy.

35:51.693 --> 35:53.278
Freeze!

35:53.361 --> 35:56.281
Drop your weapon. Do not move!
Get on the ground!

36:22.223 --> 36:23.141
Little help?

36:47.290 --> 36:48.875
Ow, my eye!

36:56.132 --> 36:57.967
Thanks for all the help, Hooch.

37:03.932 --> 37:06.643
The stuff on his teeth is so gross.

37:06.726 --> 37:09.562
The stuff on your teeth is so gross.
That's why I make you brush it.

37:09.646 --> 37:10.814
They're mostly baby teeth.

37:10.897 --> 37:13.942
Dad says I don't have to worry about them
till I get the real thing.

37:15.527 --> 37:16.528
Here.

37:16.611 --> 37:17.862
He said that?

37:19.280 --> 37:20.281
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:20.365 --> 37:21.908
-Hey, Dad.
-What's up, partner?

37:21.991 --> 37:23.785
-This a bad time?
-Depends why you came.

37:25.870 --> 37:27.914
Hey, bud. It's your lucky day.
You're gonna finish up.

37:27.997 --> 37:29.624
-Remember, gentle circles, okay?
-Okay.

37:30.208 --> 37:31.167
Here, hold his collar.

37:32.877 --> 37:35.171
-Got the records.
-Amazing.

37:35.672 --> 37:39.092
Sorry it took so long and, you know,
I wasted so much time having fun.

37:39.175 --> 37:41.511
I just kinda miss the old days.

37:43.054 --> 37:44.723
I'm really sorry I blew up at you.

37:44.806 --> 37:47.434
It's not like you made me do those things.
It was fun.

37:48.393 --> 37:50.520
Then why were you so "yell-y?"

37:51.021 --> 37:52.814
Because being an adult is hard.

37:53.398 --> 37:55.567
I'm just really trying
to get my life together.

37:56.693 --> 37:57.694
At the same time,

37:58.987 --> 38:01.865
I don't want all of Matthew's memories
to be of me saying, "No."

38:02.407 --> 38:06.036
It's not fair. You get to be
the cool BMX, video game dad,

38:06.119 --> 38:09.247
and I just get to be vegetable mom.

38:09.330 --> 38:10.165
Aw, come on.

38:10.248 --> 38:13.251
Hey, speaking of video games,
I got the new <i>Call of Duty</i>.

38:13.334 --> 38:14.335
-No.
-Hard no?

38:14.419 --> 38:15.503
-Hard no.
-Hard, hard no?

38:15.587 --> 38:17.547
-Yes. But thank you for this.
-It's your loss.

38:18.256 --> 38:21.092
Yo, little man. Dad hug it out?

38:22.344 --> 38:25.638
Up high! Down low, side, five!

38:25.722 --> 38:29.434
Go us!

38:30.018 --> 38:31.269
Love you, buddy.

38:31.895 --> 38:33.646
-I'll see you around.
-Thank you.

38:33.730 --> 38:35.565
-You stay cool.

38:38.568 --> 38:39.903
Don't feel bad, Mom.

38:39.986 --> 38:44.657
Dad's fun, but I ate so much sugar
I think I pooped a jelly bean.

38:44.741 --> 38:46.284
-Oh, no.

38:46.368 --> 38:47.994
I like vegetables, Mom.

38:48.953 --> 38:49.954
Aw.

38:52.290 --> 38:53.291
Mwah.

39:00.840 --> 39:01.925
You okay?

39:02.759 --> 39:04.469
How many times did you get slammed
into that car?

39:04.552 --> 39:06.471
Oh, five? Six? Sneven?

39:07.305 --> 39:10.892
Did I just say "sneven"?
Maybe it was more than I thought.

39:11.810 --> 39:15.855
Hey, um, look, I know-- I know things got
a little rocky there between us.

39:16.898 --> 39:19.067
-Did it?
-Yeah, you remember the yelling?

39:19.901 --> 39:22.987
The point is, I don't know how,
but I guess you were right

39:23.071 --> 39:25.990
about the hot sauce and the diaper,

39:26.074 --> 39:30.328
and I-I just think I got aggravated
because nothing seems to bother you.

39:31.579 --> 39:35.333
You remember that wave of insurgents
in Afghanistan I told you about?

39:35.417 --> 39:37.836
-Yeah.
-I lost a lot of friends that day.

39:38.837 --> 39:39.921
Went to a dark place.

39:41.047 --> 39:46.594
Until I realized everything is
either all terrible, or it's all good.

39:50.682 --> 39:52.892
You know,
Jess said I could learn from you.

39:53.685 --> 39:54.978
And I guess I did.

39:55.061 --> 39:56.438
You wanna learn?

39:56.521 --> 39:58.481
Question to ask yourself now is,

39:59.941 --> 40:02.193
"What do you do
when the diaper isn't dirty?"

40:08.700 --> 40:10.076
I'm gonna take this call.

40:12.996 --> 40:15.540
Hi, Laura. One sec.

40:15.623 --> 40:17.584
I usually take calls privately.

40:22.505 --> 40:24.799
-Hi.
-Hey, Scotty. Are you busy?

40:24.883 --> 40:26.885
No, no, no. I'm just wrapping up. Uh...

40:28.428 --> 40:30.513
You know, I'm-- I'm not exactly sure.

40:30.597 --> 40:31.931
Okay, cool.

40:32.015 --> 40:34.225
Well, anyway, good news.
I got the records.

40:34.309 --> 40:35.310
Oh, great!

40:35.393 --> 40:37.479
I was hoping you'd come up tonight
and help me go through them.

40:38.063 --> 40:39.105
Tonight? What's the rush?

40:39.689 --> 40:42.025
Scott, I just spent two days
with Grady getting these.

40:42.108 --> 40:43.109
You know what that means.

40:43.193 --> 40:45.820
But, you know, I gotta debrief,
and I got a lot of paperwork.

40:45.904 --> 40:48.156
Please, it would mean so much to me
if you came.

40:48.239 --> 40:50.700
I really think that you believing in me
gave me the strength

40:50.784 --> 40:52.744
to escape the Grady zone for once.

40:52.827 --> 40:55.872
-Wow. Serious?
<i>-Totally.</i>

40:55.955 --> 40:59.417
I don't think it's an accident Dad
gave you a dog that you need my help with,

40:59.501 --> 41:02.295
<i>and gave me a case
that I need your help with.</i>

41:02.796 --> 41:04.089
So?

41:04.673 --> 41:05.674
Okay.

41:06.966 --> 41:08.885
-I'll be there.
-Thanks.

41:13.306 --> 41:15.475
I got a preliminary report from the FBI.

41:15.558 --> 41:18.103
It looks like the assassin was
a known Mafia hit man.

41:18.186 --> 41:20.397
The case against Bianchi
just got a lot stronger.

41:20.980 --> 41:25.402
Excellent work, Chief Mendez.
I knew I was right to insist on you.

41:25.944 --> 41:28.405
Your Honor? Just a little thing.

41:28.988 --> 41:31.783
My partner and I were wondering
if our sanitation service

41:31.866 --> 41:33.410
could be considered complete?

41:33.493 --> 41:36.037
Fine. You've done enough.

41:36.121 --> 41:38.540
Thank you for saving my "stupid" life.

41:38.623 --> 41:41.042
Oh. You heard that, huh?

41:41.126 --> 41:43.294
People say crazy things
in the heat of battle.

41:43.378 --> 41:46.881
One time I screamed, "Banana!"
So, doesn't mean anything.

41:46.965 --> 41:49.718
We'll need to put together
a new security detail for the retrial.

41:49.801 --> 41:51.428
Retrial? What are you talking about?

41:51.970 --> 41:54.139
Well, I thought in light of the attack,
you'd adjourn.

41:54.222 --> 41:56.933
Nothing's being adjourned.
We need to send a message.

41:57.017 --> 41:58.560
-Agreed.
-The trial continues.

41:59.477 --> 42:02.355
Chief Mendez will come on
as head of my security detail.

42:03.732 --> 42:07.068
-Will that be a problem?
-Not at all. Happy to serve.

42:11.406 --> 42:13.783
May God have mercy on your soul.

42:19.289 --> 42:21.416
Hey, I heard about the drama.

42:21.499 --> 42:25.295
-How'd it go with Xavier?
-Honestly, I'm not entirely sure.

42:25.378 --> 42:28.298
Are you kidding? You guys were amazing.

42:28.381 --> 42:32.344
You saved the judge, the chief,
and I'm pretty sure you saved me too.

42:32.427 --> 42:34.220
Nah, Hooch did most of the work.

42:35.221 --> 42:37.557
Well then, Hooch is a hero.

42:39.017 --> 42:40.185
So are you.

42:41.853 --> 42:44.606
I never would have forgiven myself
if something had happened to you.

42:45.607 --> 42:46.608
Oh.

42:47.192 --> 42:48.276
Uh...

42:48.360 --> 42:50.820
-Hi. Is this a bad time?
-Hey.

42:50.904 --> 42:52.530
-It's a bad time.
-No, no, no. Um...

42:52.614 --> 42:57.369
Erica Mounir, this is Brooke Mailer.
Brooke, this is Erica.

42:57.452 --> 43:00.789
You know, without Erica, things today
would have gone a lot different.

43:00.872 --> 43:03.083
She figured out
what was going on with Hooch.

43:03.166 --> 43:05.502
Oh, my gosh! You're the dog lady!

43:05.585 --> 43:10.340
Yes! I mean, I'm a lady and I have dogs.

43:10.423 --> 43:11.758
Yep, that checks out.

43:11.841 --> 43:15.220
Scott, you didn't tell me
how adorable the dog lady was.

43:16.262 --> 43:18.181
Oh, thank you.

43:18.807 --> 43:24.521
Scott, you didn't tell me
that the prosecutor had such great hair.

43:25.522 --> 43:28.858
And your skin is just flawless.
And perfect teeth.

43:28.942 --> 43:29.901
Okay.

43:29.984 --> 43:31.528
-Oh, hey, Jess.
-Hey.

43:31.611 --> 43:35.031
I was just here because I parked my van
next to the courthouse

43:35.115 --> 43:38.118
where I dropped you off,
and I guess it got towed.

43:38.201 --> 43:40.745
-So I was wondering--
-We'll take care of that.

43:40.829 --> 43:44.165
Thank you.
That is the only reason I am here.

43:45.959 --> 43:48.503
I am glad you are well.

43:49.004 --> 43:50.171
All of you.

43:51.339 --> 43:52.173
<i>Namaste.</i>

43:56.094 --> 44:00.515
Well, um, I should go too.
Let you get back to saving the world.

44:01.099 --> 44:03.351
Hey, do you think
that once this trial's over,

44:03.435 --> 44:05.854
maybe we could reconnect?

44:05.937 --> 44:08.106
Grab some dinner sometime?

44:08.189 --> 44:09.899
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

44:12.444 --> 44:17.615
Oh, and I like the new hair.
It's cool. It suits you.
