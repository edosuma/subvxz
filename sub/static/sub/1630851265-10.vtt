54:38.771 --> 54:40.120
Lieutenant Newton plays dirty.

54:40.164 --> 54:42.384
He references this psych report

54:42.427 --> 54:46.344
that the CRM did on Felix,
and really does

54:46.388 --> 54:49.434
everything he can to
trigger Felix into fighting.

54:49.478 --> 54:51.480
But what he doesn't realize
is that

54:51.523 --> 54:54.134
Felix is really waiting for
his moment.

54:54.178 --> 54:57.181
[Grunts] Yeah.

54:57.224 --> 54:58.617
Have fun.

54:58.661 --> 55:01.359
Felix's journey this season
has gone from him

55:01.403 --> 55:05.102
wanting to do these things
based purely on emotion,

55:05.145 --> 55:08.018
but now he's coming from
a place of clarity.

55:08.061 --> 55:09.759
He's, I think,
more certain in who he is,

55:09.802 --> 55:13.763
so he doesn't take this bait.

55:13.806 --> 55:15.373
Now this is a fair fight.

55:15.417 --> 55:16.766
We wanted to feature
a new weapon

55:16.809 --> 55:18.115
we've never seen before,

55:18.158 --> 55:20.073
and that's the double-sided
S-pole,

55:20.117 --> 55:23.686
and that actually helps Felix
because he can now

55:23.729 --> 55:26.863
essentially fight from all sides
at the same time.

55:26.906 --> 55:29.953
Let's see what you can do.

55:29.996 --> 55:31.824
And for Jadis and Huck,

55:31.868 --> 55:34.653
we wanted a duel that
harkened back a bit to

55:34.697 --> 55:36.568
the end of last season,
but felt different,

55:36.612 --> 55:38.527
and so it's with these
kill sticks,

55:38.570 --> 55:41.051
which are the weapon of choice
at the outpost.

55:42.966 --> 55:45.882
You'll notice that the fight
between Jadis and Huck,

55:45.925 --> 55:48.319
it is very physical, obviously,
but also,

55:48.363 --> 55:51.104
there's a lot of dialogue
in there, as well.

55:51.148 --> 55:52.932
It's a verbal confrontation,

55:52.976 --> 55:54.717
not just a physical
confrontation.

55:54.760 --> 55:56.196
What you did
to Omaha --

55:56.240 --> 55:58.503
We had no choice.
Your mother understood that.

55:58.547 --> 56:00.723
My mother
lost her way.

56:00.766 --> 56:03.856
But this --
this was always who you were.

56:03.900 --> 56:06.598
It really is them sort of
pushing each other's buttons

56:06.642 --> 56:08.861
to a degree, but really,
for Huck,

56:08.905 --> 56:10.602
it's a little bit of a stall,
as well.

56:10.646 --> 56:12.038
She has a plan in place.

56:14.780 --> 56:15.999
Move!

56:16.042 --> 56:17.696
Hope!

56:17.740 --> 56:19.872
Elton had a lot of growth
this season,

56:19.916 --> 56:22.571
so what we decided to do
was use the fact

56:22.614 --> 56:24.224
that Elton had changed,

56:24.268 --> 56:26.836
regardless of if
his life were to end.

56:26.879 --> 56:29.186
I don't think he believes that
his life still would've ended.

56:29.229 --> 56:31.101
I think that he believes in
the soul now.

56:31.144 --> 56:33.799
He believes that if we die,
we're meant for something else,

56:33.843 --> 56:35.584
and there's meant to be
a new beginning somewhere,

56:35.627 --> 56:38.848
and it really felt like Elton
having been bit

56:38.891 --> 56:40.806
was ultimately lending itself to

56:40.850 --> 56:42.939
cementing of his journey
this season.

56:42.982 --> 56:45.855
It's not about us.

56:45.898 --> 56:47.509
It's about the future.

56:47.552 --> 56:50.468
Not the CRM's.
Everybody's.

56:50.512 --> 56:53.210
That's how I feel,
and I --

56:53.253 --> 56:55.473
I think it's how Elton feels,
too.

56:55.517 --> 56:59.346
Matt: To me, this whole series
has been about hope.

56:59.390 --> 57:02.175
Not necessarily the character,
but about the idea of hope.

57:02.219 --> 57:04.221
The fact that, you know,
this is not a world

57:04.264 --> 57:05.918
that's just about
surviving anymore.

57:05.962 --> 57:08.530
It's how do you build up
society again?

57:08.573 --> 57:10.183
And in the end, really,

57:10.227 --> 57:12.098
hope has everything to do with
all of that.

57:12.142 --> 57:14.492
If you don't believe in hope,
it's never gonna happen.

57:14.536 --> 57:17.800
Elton:
There's no perfect modeling,
no -- no way to predict

57:17.843 --> 57:19.497
if today is the last day.

57:19.541 --> 57:24.197
If the world lasts a year
or two or forever.

57:24.241 --> 57:26.983
Maybe all we get to know
is now.

57:27.026 --> 57:28.332
Thank you so much, everyone.

57:28.375 --> 57:30.987
I hope you enjoyed
the final season of

57:31.030 --> 57:32.510
"The Walking Dead:
World Beyond."

57:32.554 --> 57:34.512
It's been such a pleasure.

57:34.556 --> 57:36.209
Thank you so much
for joining us.

57:36.253 --> 57:37.428
Really appreciate it.
