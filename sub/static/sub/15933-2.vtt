WEBVTT

00:53.972 --> 00:54.972
Get down!

01:21.499 --> 01:22.500
One!

02:00.163 --> 02:01.623
Rosa!

02:03.041 --> 02:07.170
Tell me who talked to the police!
Who talked to them?

02:08.213 --> 02:12.133
It had to be that whore in the market.
Please, Quica!

04:42.033 --> 04:44.202
Thanks for accepting the invitation.

04:46.037 --> 04:48.456
Forgive me for the hood.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.625
It's for security reasons.

04:50.708 --> 04:53.544
- I hope you understand.
- I understand.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.547
Can I offer you something? Coffee, water?

04:57.548 --> 04:59.884
No, I'm fine, thank you.

05:00.009 --> 05:01.552
Let's begin, then.

05:15.692 --> 05:20.989
- Do you regret going to jail a year ago?
- Absolutely not. In fact...

05:21.072 --> 05:24.575
what I regret least is having escaped.

05:24.659 --> 05:27.245
The Special Forces came in
and opened fire.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.998
I couldn't risk putting my life
in their hands, right?

05:31.499 --> 05:32.750
However...

05:33.668 --> 05:37.255
I hope this interview
makes it clear to the president...

05:38.548 --> 05:42.719
I am willing to return to any prison
in the District of Antioquia.

05:43.678 --> 05:45.847
<i>The most modest and the most humble.</i>

05:46.431 --> 05:49.201
<i>But before that, I have to examine
the conditions they are going to put me in</i>

05:49.225 --> 05:53.938
<i>because, look, it would be easy,
for example, for someone to rig a car bomb</i>

05:54.063 --> 05:55.857
<i>that would explode when I arrived.</i>

06:11.622 --> 06:16.753
It turns out that my problem
turned into a political problem.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.380
It appears that I am very important

06:19.464 --> 06:21.716
to the re-election
of the president of the United States.

07:31.786 --> 07:37.959
I will always be ready to pay for
my mistakes and accept a humble jail cell

07:38.042 --> 07:41.212
when my rights are respected

07:41.337 --> 07:46.217
and they guarantee me that I will not
be transferred anywhere for any reason.

07:47.802 --> 07:51.889
Do you acknowledge that
you have committed crimes in the past,

07:52.014 --> 07:54.142
or that you ordered someone's death?

08:00.982 --> 08:04.735
That answer one could
only give to a priest.

08:04.861 --> 08:06.904
In a confessional.

08:14.412 --> 08:15.329
Marietta.

08:15.413 --> 08:17.415
- What's up?
- What happened?

08:17.498 --> 08:22.420
It looks like they killed them.
I think there were six or seven girls.

08:22.545 --> 08:24.589
Who would do something so horrible?

08:34.765 --> 08:38.102
Are you, by nature, violent and proud?

08:38.936 --> 08:42.273
Those who know me
know I have a great sense of humor.

08:43.774 --> 08:46.861
I would say that I'm a happy man.

08:46.944 --> 08:48.984
I've always been happy.
I've always been optimistic.

08:49.071 --> 08:50.865
I've always had faith in life.

08:52.408 --> 08:53.534
I always sing in the shower.

08:53.618 --> 08:56.787
How do you think the story
of Pablo Escobar will end?

09:01.542 --> 09:06.589
Well... one can never know.
I can only hope for the best.

09:12.637 --> 09:14.972
I would like to die on my own two feet.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.894
In the year 3047.

13:03.617 --> 13:07.371
Look behind you. Watch out for that guy.

13:09.498 --> 13:10.499
That's it.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.835
Smash the telephone booth.

13:13.669 --> 13:15.212
Get the pipe.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.298
I already know, Dad.

13:17.381 --> 13:19.133
You have to get it.

13:19.884 --> 13:22.636
And what's that, a woman?

13:22.720 --> 13:24.805
I'm about to fight a woman or what?

13:24.889 --> 13:28.058
- Her name's Nora.
- Oh, yeah, what's her name?

13:28.184 --> 13:29.643
Nora.

13:29.727 --> 13:32.730
Boss, excuse the interruption.
One moment, please.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.149
How do you...?

13:43.741 --> 13:45.576
What about the laboratories?

13:45.659 --> 13:49.413
It's been difficult
to find the Moncada laboratories, boss.

13:49.497 --> 13:52.333
And the ones that we find,
we can't get inside.

13:52.416 --> 13:55.419
There are police checkpoints everywhere.

13:55.503 --> 13:58.380
We lost four men
trying to get through one.

14:00.257 --> 14:01.717
Sons of bitches.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.095
And what about Judy Moncada?

14:07.556 --> 14:10.434
We can't find her anywhere. Or Don Berna.

14:10.518 --> 14:11.936
Find her.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.104
Yes, sir.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.527
And you, boys?

14:19.610 --> 14:21.904
Everything is good, boss.

14:22.738 --> 14:25.032
- How are you, Limón?
- Very good, sir.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.867
- How are you feeling?
- Very good, boss.

14:26.951 --> 14:28.702
- Comfortable?
- Thank you. Very good.

14:28.786 --> 14:29.787
Good.

14:31.247 --> 14:33.207
I'm going to teach you something.

14:35.292 --> 14:38.212
There is nothing lower than a rat.

14:40.214 --> 14:46.053
And if we let the rats run free,
the streets will be filled with them.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.097
- Understand me?
- Yes, boss.

14:49.473 --> 14:52.059
Give me one second. One second.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.978
Boss, excuse me. It's Fernando.

14:55.646 --> 14:59.567
- Tell me, Fernando.
<i>- Your interview clearly worked, Don Pablo.</i>

14:59.650 --> 15:02.152
<i>Palacio wants to meet with me right away.</i>

15:03.153 --> 15:04.738
You heard that, brother?

15:06.115 --> 15:10.160
- We have to finish our little job.
- But we already finished it, right?

15:10.286 --> 15:13.497
No, brother, there's still one left.

15:13.581 --> 15:15.833
But you already killed all the whores.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.419
I'm not talking about whores, brother.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.839
Why her?

15:21.922 --> 15:25.175
- She did everything we told her to.
- Someone talked to the police.

15:25.301 --> 15:27.761
Yeah, it was those fucking whores.

15:27.845 --> 15:30.347
She is someone I can trust, man.

15:31.265 --> 15:34.602
You can trust her, but I can't.

15:34.685 --> 15:36.020
Move it.

15:38.689 --> 15:39.857
Quica.

15:42.443 --> 15:46.447
I'm not going to tell you again, brother.
And we've got some shit we gotta do first.

15:47.281 --> 15:48.449
Good day.

15:48.532 --> 15:52.119
I have a meeting with the president.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.704
I am Fernando Duque.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.211
Your meeting is not
with the president, Mr. Duque.

16:01.337 --> 16:02.546
How's that?

16:03.964 --> 16:07.968
- With the vice minister, then?
- No, sir.

16:08.052 --> 16:11.639
The information I have here says
your meeting is with the attorney general.

16:14.350 --> 16:16.143
My apologies, Mr. Duque.

16:49.218 --> 16:50.594
Mr. Duque...

16:51.220 --> 16:56.684
I believe the whole world
has the right to a fair trial.

16:57.935 --> 17:03.107
Pablo Escobar has the same rights
as any other Colombian.

17:04.274 --> 17:09.238
If he has committed a crime,
he must be judged and indicted.

17:09.405 --> 17:12.282
He can't be hunted and killed
like an animal.

17:13.951 --> 17:15.703
Mr. De Greiff,

17:15.786 --> 17:21.792
everything you're telling me I find...
fascinating.

17:23.544 --> 17:25.879
However, I don't--

17:25.963 --> 17:30.134
I don't buckle under the pressure
of the Americans...

17:31.552 --> 17:34.138
like Gaviria, Mr. Duque.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.559
Then that means that...

17:39.643 --> 17:43.981
you would consider...
making a deal with Pablo.

17:44.106 --> 17:47.943
I am saying that Colombia...

17:48.652 --> 17:51.488
has been at war far too long.

17:52.448 --> 17:53.574
Of course.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.958
The Americans are bringing in new people.

18:03.959 --> 18:07.588
Different faces but, ultimately,
with the same motivation.

18:09.673 --> 18:12.676
They are using us
to advance their political agenda.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.762
Perhaps.

18:15.345 --> 18:19.183
But the reality is we have to accept help
wherever it comes from.

18:20.809 --> 18:23.353
And right now,
the gringos are very limited,

18:23.437 --> 18:25.522
confined to Carlos Holguín
and the embassy.

18:25.606 --> 18:30.277
On the other hand, Pablo Escobar
is gaining ground, gathering more support.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.529
Everyone is helping him in Medellín.

18:32.654 --> 18:36.325
- A long manhunt plays into his hands.
- Let's talk about Medellín.

18:42.289 --> 18:45.501
Colonel Pinzón basically
has Escobar surrounded.

18:48.045 --> 18:49.713
Do you think we'll succeed?

20:35.068 --> 20:37.279
Tip line. What do you want to report?

21:07.643 --> 21:08.685
Agent Peña?

21:34.503 --> 21:35.879
Pansies!

21:51.228 --> 21:53.063
Attorney General De Greiff.

21:53.146 --> 21:56.692
They told me that you met
with Mr. Fernando Duque.

21:57.401 --> 21:58.485
That's right.

21:59.695 --> 22:01.238
The president was very clear

22:01.321 --> 22:05.409
when he said that no one
was to communicate with Escobar's people.

22:05.492 --> 22:09.705
Unfortunately for the president,
I don't work for him.

22:10.747 --> 22:13.083
I work for the people of Colombia.

22:13.875 --> 22:17.421
And, just like the president,
I also work for the people of Colombia.

22:18.255 --> 22:21.425
And we are all working together,
in a united front, against Escobar.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.428
- This isn't a single war--
- Are you afraid of what I might find

22:24.553 --> 22:27.264
if I speak with him, Mr. Sandoval?

22:27.347 --> 22:30.017
- Excuse me?
- Tell me something.

22:30.684 --> 22:34.104
Why did you need to be there
that night at La Catedral?

22:34.938 --> 22:39.443
Why was the presence of
the vice minister of justice necessary

22:39.526 --> 22:40.902
to transfer a prisoner?

22:45.615 --> 22:48.011
Because we're not talking about
any prisoner, Attorney General.

22:48.035 --> 22:50.287
We're talking about Pablo Escobar.

22:50.370 --> 22:53.123
And I was only following the orders
of the president.

22:53.248 --> 22:55.292
I don't think that's true.

22:58.086 --> 23:00.213
Are you insinuating something,
Attorney General?

23:00.297 --> 23:04.885
- Are you accusing me of something?
- No, I'm not accusing you of anything.

23:04.968 --> 23:07.137
At least, not yet.

23:08.221 --> 23:11.224
But I'm going to open up an investigation.

23:11.308 --> 23:13.560
About the allegations...

23:14.561 --> 23:19.608
that, possibly,
you helped Pablo Escobar escape.

23:21.735 --> 23:23.653
You know what, Attorney General?

23:26.073 --> 23:27.073
Eat shit.

23:34.456 --> 23:37.250
- What the hell are we doing here?
- Running an errand, brother.

23:37.334 --> 23:40.921
- What errand?
- For Don Pablo, brother.

23:42.839 --> 23:43.924
Hello.

23:44.007 --> 23:46.259
Hello, gentlemen,
can I help you with something?

23:46.343 --> 23:50.514
Of course, brother, I'm here to pick up
a package, under the name Alvarez.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.682
Yes, sir. Right away, with pleasure.

23:52.808 --> 23:54.101
Go ahead.

23:55.769 --> 23:59.314
Brother... let's give up on the girl.
She's not coming back.

24:00.357 --> 24:02.192
Are you afraid or what, Limón?

24:07.030 --> 24:09.533
Close your fucking mouth
and do what I say.

24:21.211 --> 24:22.629
Mr. Alvarez!

24:24.214 --> 24:25.132
Quica!

24:25.215 --> 24:28.718
This is the best toilet they make.
You really know your shit.

24:28.844 --> 24:30.011
Brother!

24:30.804 --> 24:32.639
That's what I'm talking about, brother.

24:32.722 --> 24:34.057
Good.

24:35.058 --> 24:38.019
Boys, put it in the car.
We've got some business to take care of.

24:38.854 --> 24:43.567
I am going to take out her eyes
and make her eat them, that rat bitch.

24:51.408 --> 24:54.744
- What number?
- Room three. I already told you.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.864
Son of a bitch. You told me
that she was going to be here.

25:12.888 --> 25:15.765
I don't know, brother.
I think this is where she lives.

25:20.395 --> 25:22.522
She's not there.
Anyway, tomorrow is better.

25:22.606 --> 25:23.940
We'll come back later.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.194
Fuck that, brother.

25:30.906 --> 25:32.073
Quica!

25:41.541 --> 25:42.918
Over there, brother.

25:58.975 --> 26:00.644
I got something, brother.

26:12.572 --> 26:17.077
That bitch. I'm going to rip out her
tongue and shove it up her ass, brother.

26:18.161 --> 26:21.665
I told you she wasn't here.
At this hour, she's already working.

26:21.748 --> 26:24.251
- This is bullshit, brother.
- She's not here.

26:24.334 --> 26:26.002
We'll come back later, then.

26:30.298 --> 26:32.425
If the president
doesn't agree with the deal,

26:32.509 --> 26:35.011
then we haven't won anything. Right?

26:35.845 --> 26:41.601
Pablo, we have found a very good option.

26:41.685 --> 26:43.144
Definitely.

26:44.020 --> 26:47.274
If you allow me to negotiate
with De Greiff

26:47.357 --> 26:50.360
- and create some dissention in the ranks--
- Oh, Fernando.

26:50.485 --> 26:52.696
That's not why I pay you, Fernando.

26:52.821 --> 26:56.950
You pay me to strategize
and that's exactly what I am doing.

26:58.451 --> 27:00.620
Pablo, you have to understand...

27:02.038 --> 27:06.293
The moment-- The position
that Gaviria is in right now--

27:06.376 --> 27:12.048
What happened at La Catedral
was a humiliating failure for him.

27:13.383 --> 27:17.679
Right now, he's thinking
that capturing you is his only option.

27:19.556 --> 27:21.224
And he's not thinking about

27:21.308 --> 27:27.022
trying to find some way
to speak with us, but...

27:30.066 --> 27:33.737
De Greiff, he is willing to speak.

27:34.904 --> 27:37.866
And he has the autonomy to make deals.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.416
Fine, okay.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.710
Let's try it.

27:50.086 --> 27:53.840
You're not going to believe it,
but the attorney general

27:53.923 --> 27:56.009
supports the legalization of drugs.

27:56.092 --> 27:58.261
- Don't bullshit me.
- It's true.

27:59.679 --> 28:05.101
Trust me, Pablo, little by little,
with patience, with time--

28:05.185 --> 28:07.395
What we don't have is time, Fernando.

28:11.107 --> 28:13.693
Fernando, excuse us.

28:13.777 --> 28:15.612
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.072
- Blackie.
- Yes, sir.

28:18.406 --> 28:19.908
Thank you very much, Fernando.

28:20.784 --> 28:22.786
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.079
Excuse me.

28:35.548 --> 28:36.800
What's wrong?

28:39.302 --> 28:41.137
We can't live like this, Pablo.

28:41.805 --> 28:45.058
Running from one place to another, hiding,

28:45.141 --> 28:46.893
hoping the government wants to negotiate.

28:46.976 --> 28:49.145
Gaviria is going to negotiate, Tata.

28:50.772 --> 28:54.484
He's too intelligent and too weak not to.

28:57.237 --> 28:59.155
How are you so calm?

29:00.990 --> 29:05.745
Pablo, if Gaviria doesn't want you in jail
then we know perfectly well what he wants.

29:11.084 --> 29:13.753
I think it's time for us
to leave Colombia.

29:15.672 --> 29:18.842
I know we agreed we would never leave,
but things have changed.

29:18.967 --> 29:20.844
No, nothing has changed.

29:29.936 --> 29:34.357
My love, we have everything we need.

29:34.482 --> 29:37.360
Let's get the children
and go to some other place.

29:38.319 --> 29:40.822
A place where we don't have to hide.

29:42.365 --> 29:45.869
We're not going to
spend our lives in hiding.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.543
I promise you that.

31:33.101 --> 31:36.646
Ortiz, don't let him
out of your sight. Over.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.149
They saw La Quica buying a toilet.

31:43.987 --> 31:46.072
Not just any toilet.

31:46.155 --> 31:49.325
The same one that Pablo had
at La Catedral. A Kohler.

31:55.456 --> 31:57.166
We need more.

31:57.792 --> 32:00.420
- But what else, Peña?
- Where did they see him?

32:00.503 --> 32:02.755
Going toward the hills on San Isidro Road.

32:39.125 --> 32:42.378
<i>Baby, when are you coming?
You left me all alone.</i>

32:42.462 --> 32:44.714
<i>I can't right now. It's too dangerous.</i>

32:44.839 --> 32:47.050
<i>But you said you were coming.</i>

32:47.175 --> 32:51.220
<i>Let things calm down a little bit.
I'll show you a good time.</i>

33:47.694 --> 33:50.029
Correct me if I'm wrong...

33:51.364 --> 33:55.368
In the last raid,
your two men managed to capture

33:55.451 --> 33:59.789
the president of the United States,
George Bush.

34:01.541 --> 34:04.794
That was based on many different calls
from the tip line.

34:04.919 --> 34:08.631
This is the voice of Velasco.

34:09.424 --> 34:13.636
Ms. Messina, apparently
you think my men work for you.

34:13.720 --> 34:17.056
You are mistaken. I don't work for you.

34:17.140 --> 34:20.476
I decide how we are going
to work together. Is that clear?

34:22.145 --> 34:24.981
And I already know what happened
to the last man that worked with you.

34:25.106 --> 34:27.066
Colonel Carrillo.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.943
He was exiled to Spain.

34:59.599 --> 35:02.935
Colonel, General Silva is on the phone.

35:03.019 --> 35:04.270
Excuse me, Colonel.

35:13.154 --> 35:14.697
General?

35:33.800 --> 35:36.135
Move your asses! The police are coming!

35:36.219 --> 35:39.889
Get the cars and the money ready
right now. They're close, now!

35:39.972 --> 35:41.140
Boss!

35:43.184 --> 35:45.019
Boss, forgive me, it's urgent.

35:47.063 --> 35:48.063
Boss.

35:49.232 --> 35:50.483
It's the police.

35:50.566 --> 35:53.528
They're coming up the hill.
We have to leave right now, boss.

35:56.697 --> 35:59.075
Pablo. Pablo!

36:03.830 --> 36:05.248
Sons of bitches.

36:05.373 --> 36:07.500
They're coming from
the other side too, sir.

36:07.583 --> 36:09.669
- What happened?
- We have to leave right now.

36:09.752 --> 36:11.087
The police are coming.

36:11.838 --> 36:13.339
- Get the cars ready.
- Yes, boss.

36:13.422 --> 36:15.091
- Wait out back.
- Yes, boss.

36:15.216 --> 36:16.259
Pablo!

36:16.384 --> 36:18.928
Go get the kids.
We have to leave right now.

36:31.107 --> 36:34.443
Come this way. Hurry up!

36:39.448 --> 36:42.577
Hurry. Over here, through the tunnel.

36:49.375 --> 36:52.461
Surround the house! Let's go!

37:30.917 --> 37:32.335
They're gone, sir.

37:33.961 --> 37:38.633
Colonel, nobody's in the house,
no signs of life, sir.

37:40.843 --> 37:42.261
Shit.

37:43.638 --> 37:44.805
At ease.

38:44.365 --> 38:46.242
Go ahead, come in.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.373
The bedrooms...

38:54.542 --> 38:56.168
they're on the right.

39:10.057 --> 39:11.934
Everything is okay, Tata.

39:12.059 --> 39:15.438
No, Pablo.
This time everything is not okay.

39:15.521 --> 39:18.941
Sweetheart, if Pablo
says everything is okay,

39:19.025 --> 39:21.145
- it's because everything is--
- Was I talking to you?

39:23.446 --> 39:25.614
I'm talking to my husband.

39:27.616 --> 39:29.869
That was very close, Pablo.

39:29.952 --> 39:31.871
And tomorrow, what?

39:31.954 --> 39:34.290
Do you want your children
to watch those men kill you?

39:34.373 --> 39:36.417
No one is going to die, Tata.

39:38.044 --> 39:39.628
I am dealing with it.

39:40.629 --> 39:41.922
How, Pablo?

39:42.715 --> 39:44.091
Tell me how.

39:45.885 --> 39:47.303
Negotiating?

39:48.387 --> 39:50.765
Yesterday, they nearly killed you
for negotiating.

39:52.433 --> 39:55.227
If you are going to fix everything,
fix it for good.

40:07.656 --> 40:09.283
Don't worry.

41:33.409 --> 41:34.409
Ready.

41:37.663 --> 41:40.708
Boss, everybody is ready.
What's the order?

41:41.584 --> 41:42.751
Do it.

41:43.669 --> 41:44.879
Yes, sir.

41:48.591 --> 41:49.925
- What's up?
- Ready.

41:50.050 --> 41:51.760
All right.

41:54.555 --> 41:56.182
We're ready, sir.

42:24.919 --> 42:26.212
Come.

42:59.495 --> 43:01.080
Step on it!

43:54.049 --> 43:55.384
Do it, brother.

43:56.719 --> 43:58.721
It's cold, you fucking fag!

43:58.804 --> 44:01.223
Kill him! Do it, bitch!

44:01.348 --> 44:02.348
Kill him!
