<font color=#FFFF00>Story One:</font>  <font color=#00ff00>The Letter</font>

00:09.618 --> 00:10.680
Wow.

00:10.792 --> 00:13.570
I can't believe you guys got
a reservation at this spot.

00:13.672 --> 00:16.282
Or are we just pretending
to be the next party of four,

00:16.370 --> 00:17.546
regardless of what name
they call?

00:17.634 --> 00:18.821
Oh, yeah, 'cause
I'll do that.

00:18.909 --> 00:20.016
I am starving.

00:20.127 --> 00:21.509
Spencer, party of three.

00:21.597 --> 00:23.245
Yeah, that's us.
Sorry, Greg, you're out.

00:23.333 --> 00:25.688
No, no, no,
we have an actual reservation.

00:25.834 --> 00:27.626
And not only that...

00:27.883 --> 00:30.165
Dinner is on us tonight.

00:30.539 --> 00:32.264
- What? No way.
- Uh, absolutely not. -Yes!

00:32.351 --> 00:33.571
- No, no, no. We insist.
- No. -Yes!

00:33.659 --> 00:36.147
As a thank you for helping Lucas
get into Lark's preschool.

00:36.235 --> 00:38.384
He wouldn't be there without
your letter of recommendation,

00:38.491 --> 00:40.339
- so...
- And he already got reprimanded

00:40.427 --> 00:42.176
for bullying.
And you know what bullies have?

00:42.274 --> 00:44.296
Confidence.
So, thank you.

00:44.384 --> 00:45.915
- It was our pleasure. Really.
- Yeah, really.

00:46.009 --> 00:48.803
It's the least we can do.
And not just because it means

00:48.891 --> 00:50.994
that now you can pick Lark up for us.

00:51.081 --> 00:52.827
Tonight is our treat.
You guys just chill out.

00:52.915 --> 00:54.155
We're gonna go buy a round.

00:54.243 --> 00:57.384
Wow. Look at that.

00:57.618 --> 00:59.907
Hey, babe, good job
writing that letter.

01:00.188 --> 01:01.567
I didn't write that letter.

01:01.655 --> 01:03.201
What do you mean?
You've been acting like you did.

01:03.289 --> 01:04.569
Because I thought you wrote it.

01:04.658 --> 01:06.813
I specifically remember you
saying that you would write it,

01:06.901 --> 01:09.342
because you elbowed me
in the ribs so hard

01:09.430 --> 01:10.469
that I spit my retainer
out

01:10.557 --> 01:11.647
- into the toilet.
- No, no, no, no.

01:11.735 --> 01:13.391
I remember you promising,
because you had just finished

01:13.479 --> 01:15.780
that rap documentary and
you made up some ridiculous rhyme

01:15.868 --> 01:16.741
- about the letter.
- Listen,

01:16.829 --> 01:18.561
just because I spit
a sick freestyle

01:18.649 --> 01:20.366
does not mean I'm actually gonna do it.

01:20.454 --> 01:23.264
Greg, come on. They are paying
for a crazy expensive dinner

01:23.352 --> 01:25.131
because they think we are
the reason that Lucas got in.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.296
So we have to tell them.

01:26.384 --> 01:27.706
I feel awful.

01:27.794 --> 01:29.735
Straight up unlawful.

01:30.984 --> 01:32.844
Hey! We got

01:32.931 --> 01:34.772
the fanciest drink on the menu.

01:34.860 --> 01:36.829
These are chocolate martinis.

01:36.923 --> 01:38.397
The bartender was so impressed.

01:38.485 --> 01:40.759
He said no one's
ever ordered four before.

01:40.977 --> 01:43.538
- - Okay.
Uh, look, guys, there-there's no way

01:43.626 --> 01:45.296
that we can let you
buy dinner tonight.

01:45.384 --> 01:46.803
Well, too bad, bro.

01:46.891 --> 01:48.577
When we were
being interviewed,

01:48.665 --> 01:51.960
we talked about how much
we wanted Lark and Lucas

01:52.048 --> 01:53.884
to-to be as close
as you and I are.

01:54.005 --> 01:55.053
Say what?

01:55.141 --> 01:56.858
And I realized
that I was talking about

01:56.946 --> 01:59.344
the relationship
that I wish we had.

01:59.493 --> 02:01.765
Because I know that
I haven't always been

02:01.853 --> 02:03.200
the best brother, Greg.

02:03.287 --> 02:04.555
But I want that to change,

02:04.643 --> 02:06.224
and I want it to change
starting today.

02:06.640 --> 02:07.938
'Kay.

02:08.094 --> 02:09.765
To a sinfully
sweet evening.

02:09.854 --> 02:11.970
These were $18 each.

02:12.058 --> 02:13.599
Short,

02:13.687 --> 02:15.168
- party of four.
- Oh, right here.

02:15.256 --> 02:17.024
- Follow me.
- Yay.

02:18.016 --> 02:19.116
Oh, my God.

02:19.203 --> 02:20.452
Did you hear that?

02:20.539 --> 02:22.266
Uh-huh. You know
what I didn't hear?

02:22.354 --> 02:24.220
You telling him that
we didn't write that letter.

02:24.308 --> 02:25.723
Oh. But...

02:25.810 --> 02:28.374
Jen, I have never heard him
say anything like that

02:28.462 --> 02:29.794
to me before, all right?

02:29.881 --> 02:31.796
All right? A-And, look,
I'm not gonna mess up

02:31.883 --> 02:33.731
our one chance
at really being close

02:33.818 --> 02:34.915
by telling him
I screwed up.

02:35.003 --> 02:36.551
Their kid got
into the school.

02:36.639 --> 02:37.768
Victimless crime.

02:37.856 --> 02:39.376
Yeah, until the bill comes.

02:39.915 --> 02:41.673
Well, then we'll
just order light.

02:41.761 --> 02:43.514
Oh, good. I'm starving.

02:43.602 --> 02:45.657
So this works out perfectly.

02:46.609 --> 02:49.899
All right, I think I will
just have the broth.

02:50.430 --> 02:51.657
Jen,

02:51.745 --> 02:53.727
tonight's a night
to splurge.

02:53.815 --> 02:56.399
No, no. I really need
to lose some weight.

02:56.487 --> 02:58.344
Who told you that?
You said you were starving.

02:58.432 --> 03:00.665
She's not as hungry as
she thought she was.

03:00.753 --> 03:02.151
Isn't that right, Jen?

03:02.239 --> 03:03.274
Mm-hmm.

03:04.632 --> 03:07.188
If you ever want
to talk, call me.

03:08.204 --> 03:09.966
You know what, I,
uh, I think, uh,

03:10.054 --> 03:11.561
this little plate of olives

03:11.649 --> 03:12.985
- will fill me right up.
- Greg,

03:13.073 --> 03:16.126
dude, you're gonna split the
tomahawk steak for two with me.

03:16.704 --> 03:18.790
But... but that's
a couple's dish.

03:18.878 --> 03:20.969
Well, that's what we are.
We're a couple of brothers.

03:21.078 --> 03:24.141
Come on, you-you got
to split that with me.

03:24.758 --> 03:26.008
'Kay.

03:26.096 --> 03:28.538
Uh, but, Greg, what about

03:28.626 --> 03:30.387
all those filling olives?

03:30.474 --> 03:32.824
I mean, some of them
are even stuffed.

03:32.911 --> 03:35.159
No, no, no,
no, no. My, uh...

03:35.246 --> 03:38.329
my-my brother wants to
share an entrée with me,

03:38.416 --> 03:40.469
and-and we've never
shared anything before.

03:40.752 --> 03:44.438
Yes, but you could share
a veggie burger.

03:44.526 --> 03:45.673
Oh, I don't want
a veggie burger.

03:45.761 --> 03:47.571
Yeah, but Matt doesn't
want a veggie burger.

03:47.984 --> 03:50.268
Jen, do you want
a veggie burger?

03:51.266 --> 03:52.891
Let's just get one,
put it on the table,

03:52.979 --> 03:54.204
see what happens.

04:00.270 --> 04:02.930
Uh, psst, Jen,

04:03.102 --> 04:04.449
this is the veggie burger.

04:04.537 --> 04:06.352
For later,
when Greg's not looking.

04:06.984 --> 04:08.321
Thank you.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.163
Okay,
I'm dying

04:10.251 --> 04:11.274
to know.

04:11.362 --> 04:12.899
What did you write
in the letter?

04:13.159 --> 04:15.809
Who remembers?

04:15.923 --> 04:17.144
Well, can we have a copy?

04:17.253 --> 04:18.801
I...

04:18.966 --> 04:21.118
- don't think that is allowed.
- No.

04:21.206 --> 04:23.016
Oh, come on, man. Just,
like, show us on your phone

04:23.194 --> 04:24.352
or something, you know?
I mean, it's not like

04:24.440 --> 04:25.522
- we're gonna tell anyone.
- No.

04:25.610 --> 04:27.357
- Now?
- Yeah. -Yeah.

04:27.530 --> 04:29.112
Oh.
Yeah, I...

04:29.200 --> 04:30.633
It's not on
my phone. I-I...

04:30.721 --> 04:33.136
- I sent that, uh, e-mail from my laptop.
- Yeah.

04:33.224 --> 04:35.706
Oh. Well, then it should
still be on your phone.

04:35.844 --> 04:37.325
Okay, does anyone else
feel like Colleen

04:37.413 --> 04:38.414
is attacking me right now?

04:38.502 --> 04:40.225
Okay. All right. No, no, no,
Colleen, back off.

04:40.328 --> 04:41.543
Greg's my little brother,
you know?

04:41.596 --> 04:42.988
He's just doing things
the right way.

04:43.076 --> 04:44.996
We'll-we'll just a copy
from the school tomorrow.

04:46.051 --> 04:47.499
Totally.

04:47.719 --> 04:49.167
Um...

04:49.387 --> 04:50.933
we...

04:51.334 --> 04:53.980
did not write the letter.

04:55.465 --> 04:57.214
But-but before
you get upset,

04:57.302 --> 05:00.410
Matt, I-I just want you to think
back very clearly on this night.

05:00.498 --> 05:02.988
We never explicitly stated
that we wrote the letter,

05:03.076 --> 05:04.402
so...

05:05.371 --> 05:06.729
Wow, man.

05:07.285 --> 05:08.746
I can't believe
you let us down.

05:08.834 --> 05:10.481
We shared a bone, Greg.

05:10.569 --> 05:12.105
You're right. You're
absolutely right.

05:12.209 --> 05:13.777
I am... I am sorry, Matthew.

05:13.865 --> 05:17.127
And, uh, why don't you
let us share the bill,

05:17.291 --> 05:18.824
like brothers?

05:18.912 --> 05:20.259
How 'bout you pay
for the whole thing?

05:20.347 --> 05:21.916
Sure. That sounds fair.

05:23.575 --> 05:24.990
Okay, well,
if this is on us,

05:25.078 --> 05:26.392
um, 'scuse me, yeah,

05:26.572 --> 05:28.174
please throw this away.

05:28.532 --> 05:30.201
I'm just gonna...

05:34.829 --> 05:36.972
<font color=#FFFF00>Story Two:</font>  <font color=#00ff00>The Pig Short</font>

05:38.465 --> 05:41.381
It took four years,
but I'm finally done.

05:41.863 --> 05:44.199
- Hi.
- Let's go get me a pig.

05:44.287 --> 05:46.597
A pig?
What are you talking about?

05:46.685 --> 05:50.536
You promised I could have one
if I did everything on this list.

05:50.705 --> 05:53.128
"Straight A's,
saved money for pig food,

05:53.217 --> 05:55.339
walked Pop-Pop's dog
to learn responsibility."

05:55.396 --> 05:56.269
Oh.

05:56.357 --> 05:59.493
Hey, hey, hey. "Stop eating pork
out of respect for pigs' lives."

05:59.596 --> 06:00.587
You didn't do that one.

06:00.675 --> 06:02.902
I give you bacon
every Saturday.

06:02.990 --> 06:04.404
And I give it to Dad.

06:04.558 --> 06:05.609
Tim.

06:05.696 --> 06:08.183
We had a good thing
going there, Sophia.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.292
Ah, there's got to be
a loophole here somewhere.

06:11.380 --> 06:12.916
It's not notarized.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.417
Oh. Yes, it is.

06:17.172 --> 06:19.455
What are we gonna do?

06:19.738 --> 06:23.040
Besides tell Jen to stop
notarizing things for the kids.

06:23.128 --> 06:24.542
We can't get her a pig.

06:24.630 --> 06:26.496
Tim, we have to.
We promised her.

06:26.584 --> 06:29.097
We can't teach her that promises
are just meaningless.

06:29.185 --> 06:31.056
We can get her something
she wants even more.

06:31.144 --> 06:33.410
Are you saying that
we should bribe our daughter?

06:33.498 --> 06:34.512
Yes.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.816
Oh, great.
I just wanted to make sure

06:35.904 --> 06:37.285
that we were on the same page.

06:38.314 --> 06:39.566
Hey.

06:39.677 --> 06:42.212
I was just thinking of names
for my pig.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.331
- Ooh.
- What do you like better,

06:43.419 --> 06:44.683
Kevin Bacon

06:44.903 --> 06:46.984
or Kiefer Sutherland?

06:47.792 --> 06:49.371
Obviously,
both are strong.

06:49.459 --> 06:50.644
Yeah, you're right.

06:50.731 --> 06:52.541
I'll just have to meet him
and see what fits.

06:52.638 --> 06:54.996
Mm. Okay, so, first of all,

06:55.099 --> 06:57.751
we are
so proud of you

06:57.839 --> 07:00.431
for accomplishing
everything on that list.

07:00.518 --> 07:02.734
- So, so proud.
- Mm-hmm.

07:03.519 --> 07:05.703
I'm not getting a pig, am I?

07:06.300 --> 07:08.652
Well, we were thinking
that maybe...

07:08.740 --> 07:11.630
there was something you wanted
even more than a pig.

07:11.718 --> 07:12.808
Like what?

07:12.896 --> 07:14.519
- Like a ficus.
- Ho, ho, ho.

07:14.607 --> 07:17.675
Mom, Mom,
how is that better than a pig?

07:17.793 --> 07:20.496
- Hey, how about sea monkeys?
- Ooh!

07:20.604 --> 07:22.619
Monkeys are way
cooler than pigs.

07:22.839 --> 07:24.652
Those are brine shrimp.

07:24.757 --> 07:26.993
Shrimp are way
cooler than pigs.

07:27.081 --> 07:29.226
Listen, there's got
to be something

07:29.313 --> 07:31.113
that you want
other than a pig.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.916
I don't know.

07:33.283 --> 07:34.777
Maybe a cell phone.

07:34.865 --> 07:37.019
Oh, come on.
We talked about that. No.

07:37.107 --> 07:40.123
You're 11. You really expect
us to buy you a cell phone?

07:40.211 --> 07:42.827
No. I expect you
to get me a pig...

07:42.915 --> 07:44.462
like you promised.

07:45.175 --> 07:46.691
Okay, fine,
we'll get you a cell phone,

07:46.779 --> 07:49.064
but... we use parental controls,

07:49.152 --> 07:50.871
and I get to check it
whenever I want to.

07:50.959 --> 07:52.273
And no case.

07:52.361 --> 07:53.743
But what if I drop it?

07:53.831 --> 07:56.246
All right, a decent case,
but not a great one.

07:57.597 --> 07:59.451
I guess that's okay.

08:04.558 --> 08:06.167
Okay, joke is on her,

08:06.255 --> 08:08.402
because I was willing
to go as high as a car.

08:08.490 --> 08:09.517
Hmm!

08:09.605 --> 08:12.247
You guys know she wanted
a phone all along, right?

08:12.467 --> 08:13.808
No, she wanted a pig.

08:13.896 --> 08:16.445
That's why she asked for a pig.
Try to keep up, Sam.

08:16.595 --> 08:19.759
Really? She talks to me about
getting a cell phone every week.

08:19.847 --> 08:21.945
When was the last time
she even mentioned a pig?

08:22.753 --> 08:25.345
Yesterday, and
then there was

08:25.433 --> 08:27.084
that one time before
that she mentioned...

08:27.172 --> 08:29.353
- I don't know. Well, you tell her, Tim.
- Aah!

08:29.441 --> 08:31.003
All right, look.

08:31.434 --> 08:33.941
See this? This is a pig binder.

08:34.113 --> 08:36.441
Picture of a pig.
No cell phone on it.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.331
A happy little fat pig.

08:38.419 --> 08:40.183
And inside, you'll find

08:40.270 --> 08:41.519
more drawings of pigs.

08:42.086 --> 08:44.768
And then in here, blank pages.

08:44.974 --> 08:47.443
"Pig equals cell phone."

08:47.531 --> 08:49.539
That's written...
over and over again.

08:49.627 --> 08:52.480
This is also
"pig equals cell phone,"

08:52.568 --> 08:53.677
a little more
emphatically.

08:53.764 --> 08:55.312
There's lots
of pages of that.

08:55.615 --> 08:57.928
And then, well, that's just
a picture of a cell phone.

08:58.068 --> 09:01.117
- Damn, she got us.
- She played us, Tim.

09:01.205 --> 09:02.670
And honestly, I got to tell you,
babe, she didn't even

09:02.758 --> 09:04.107
have to try that hard.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.643
I'm sorry, guys.

09:05.977 --> 09:07.765
It sucks to have one of
your own kids lie to you.

09:08.999 --> 09:10.101
Uh, anyway,

09:10.189 --> 09:12.772
I'm off to the library
to study with Jenna.

09:12.867 --> 09:15.554
You know, don't wait up.

09:15.940 --> 09:18.122
Oh. Bye, sweetie.
Have fun at the library!

09:18.210 --> 09:20.109
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Hold on.

09:20.197 --> 09:21.934
Get back here, Sam.

09:25.088 --> 09:28.000
Here's 30 bucks.
Buy yourself some books.

09:30.843 --> 09:33.828
Well, at least we still
have one kid we can trust.

09:33.916 --> 09:34.929
Right.

09:35.017 --> 09:36.750
Mm. What are we gonna do
about Sophia?

09:36.838 --> 09:39.318
Well, I think we're just gonna
have to give her what she wants.

09:42.445 --> 09:44.734
Oh. Hey, honey.

09:44.914 --> 09:47.492
- Hi.
- Listen, your dad is home,

09:47.580 --> 09:50.812
and he has something that is
going to make you very happy.

09:50.900 --> 09:53.281
Wait. Seriously?
My own cell phone?

09:53.369 --> 09:55.984
Oh, no, no, no. Way better
than that, right, Tim?

09:56.072 --> 09:58.437
Yup! Here he is.

10:00.364 --> 10:01.914
What the heck is that?

10:02.002 --> 10:05.632
Well, this is a promise.
Sophia, meet Kevin.

10:05.732 --> 10:07.681
Oh.

10:07.776 --> 10:09.224
Oh, is there a problem?

10:09.312 --> 10:10.927
Yeah, you wanted
a pig, right?

10:11.015 --> 10:14.515
I did. I do. I-I just wanted
the little teacup pig,

10:14.645 --> 10:16.257
you know,
that small one from the farm.

10:16.345 --> 10:18.210
Oh, no. I know.
No, this is him!

10:18.374 --> 10:19.492
Yeah, he grew up.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.990
He's gonna be 200 pounds
before you know it.

10:22.078 --> 10:23.570
That's how much I weigh.

10:27.406 --> 10:28.572
Did you see the look
on her face?

10:28.664 --> 10:30.781
That was some solid parenting.

10:30.869 --> 10:33.209
- Yeah, that'll teach her to play a player.
- Yeah.

10:36.054 --> 10:38.210
Hang on. What?

10:38.650 --> 10:40.664
Oh, honey, no.
Don't touch a thing.

10:40.752 --> 10:43.890
It's Sophia's pig.
This is all her responsibility.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.960
Boy, I'd hate to be
Sophia tomorrow.

10:47.378 --> 10:49.540
- You're okay.
- I'm good.

10:51.868 --> 10:54.337
<font color=#FFFF00>Story Three:</font>  <font color=#00ff00>Ball Grown Up</font>

10:57.970 --> 10:59.049
Tim?

10:59.137 --> 11:00.244
Oh. Yes.

11:00.332 --> 11:01.861
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.955
So...

11:05.133 --> 11:07.845
okay, if Heather were having
a problem with her...

11:07.933 --> 11:09.439
testicles,

11:09.650 --> 11:11.456
would you go to
her dad about it?

11:11.843 --> 11:13.525
Do you mean ovaries?

11:13.721 --> 11:15.722
'Cause then I'd go to her mom.

11:15.810 --> 11:17.558
No. Right, of course.

11:17.657 --> 11:20.183
But, no, what if
they were balls?

11:20.338 --> 11:21.589
Heather's balls?

11:21.677 --> 11:24.659
Yeah, now you're getting it.
So, would you go to John

11:24.747 --> 11:27.699
if Heather's balls
felt a little funky?

11:28.004 --> 11:29.207
Yes?

11:29.295 --> 11:31.574
Good, 'cause Tyler's got
a lump on one of his balls.

11:31.662 --> 11:34.544
My big boy's balls?
Oh, no.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.122
Yeah, I'm worried, but he
won't do anything about it.

11:37.210 --> 11:38.292
All right, I'll talk to him.

11:38.380 --> 11:40.382
Thank you.
It's the left one.

11:41.706 --> 11:43.645
- His left.
- Right.

11:46.387 --> 11:48.082
Hey, bud.

11:48.170 --> 11:49.885
Cool if I hang?

11:50.408 --> 11:51.426
Oh.

11:51.514 --> 11:53.254
Beanbag chair, right?

11:53.910 --> 11:55.371
Nature's lumpy mass.

11:57.201 --> 12:00.059
- Those words don't make sense together.
- Just saying.

12:00.409 --> 12:03.465
I don't care how many lumps
I find in my bean sack.

12:05.232 --> 12:06.653
So Clementine told you?

12:06.741 --> 12:08.889
Yeah. In the weirdest
way possible.

12:08.977 --> 12:10.533
It'll probably just go away,

12:10.767 --> 12:12.609
like when
my black toenail fell off

12:12.697 --> 12:13.835
and there was another one
underneath.

12:13.923 --> 12:15.876
I know you're scared,
and you obviously know nothing

12:15.964 --> 12:17.025
about the human body,

12:17.113 --> 12:19.461
but that's why you're lucky
you got an old man like me,

12:19.549 --> 12:22.587
who's... a doctor, knows
everything about the body.

12:22.675 --> 12:23.986
- Do you need help?
- No. No.

12:24.074 --> 12:25.119
I'm good.

12:25.207 --> 12:27.095
Oh!

12:27.183 --> 12:29.966
Aah. That was bone
on wood.

12:30.631 --> 12:32.306
Look, why don't
you just...

12:32.531 --> 12:36.282
let Doctor Dad take a look
at it and flop it out?

12:36.370 --> 12:37.931
That is never going to happen.

12:38.019 --> 12:39.867
You're uncomfortable,
I see that.

12:40.572 --> 12:42.227
Would it help
if I showed you mine first?

12:43.001 --> 12:45.619
- How about I just go
see a doctor who's not my father?

12:45.707 --> 12:49.454
Attaboy.
You show those balls who's boss.

12:50.901 --> 12:52.883
So, Tyler, big guy,

12:53.306 --> 12:56.400
how's, uh, your... potatoes?

12:56.647 --> 12:58.329
Dad, they are fine.

12:58.417 --> 12:59.658
What are you guys talking about?

12:59.746 --> 13:02.439
Mm. It's definitely
not potatoes.

13:02.530 --> 13:04.790
Tyler has a lump on one
of his testicles.

13:04.878 --> 13:06.693
- -Clem!

13:07.299 --> 13:09.384
What? Why didn't you tell me?

13:09.472 --> 13:11.251
Because it's private.

13:11.339 --> 13:13.306
Now, tell everyone
what the doctor said.

13:13.957 --> 13:16.587
I don't know, he-he-he-
he put it under a microscope

13:16.675 --> 13:18.173
and said that everything
was good.

13:18.261 --> 13:20.064
That's not how that exam goes.

13:20.167 --> 13:23.103
Well, he-he smushed them in that
machine, and he took a picture.

13:23.191 --> 13:24.539
That's a mammogram.

13:24.627 --> 13:25.841
I can't believe you didn't go.

13:26.003 --> 13:27.400
I can't believe
we're talking about this

13:27.488 --> 13:28.447
at the dinner table.

13:28.535 --> 13:29.982
You need to get yourself
to a doctor.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.142
You're not a little kid anymore.
Heather, stop cutting his meat!

13:32.230 --> 13:33.611
I don't want him to choke.

13:33.699 --> 13:36.448
Well, we both need to stop
treating him like a little kid.

13:36.591 --> 13:38.861
He's a grown-up, and he needs
to take care of himself.

13:38.971 --> 13:41.478
Okay, if we stop talking
about this right now,

13:41.566 --> 13:44.416
I will go to the doctor,
like an adult.

13:46.207 --> 13:49.681
Look, guys, I know it feels like
it's really hard right now,

13:49.769 --> 13:51.384
but you're going to
look back on kindergarten

13:51.472 --> 13:53.121
as the best year of your life.

13:53.831 --> 13:55.746
♪ ...quack, quack, here
and a quack, quack there... ♪

13:55.833 --> 13:56.861
Trust me.

13:56.949 --> 13:58.884
Okay, skivvies down.

14:00.447 --> 14:03.040
Now, remember, only your doctor
or your parents

14:03.128 --> 14:05.150
should touch you
in the bathing suit area.

14:05.238 --> 14:06.392
Or my wife.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.884
I don't hear that a lot
in the choo choo room.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.744
Okay.
So...

14:11.832 --> 14:13.267
Uh, Tyler.

14:13.355 --> 14:15.542
You still pursuing
being an astronaut?

14:15.654 --> 14:16.801
Yes.

14:17.059 --> 14:19.628
Good, good.

14:21.190 --> 14:22.509
A little cold.

14:22.597 --> 14:26.547
Well, uh, I don't think you have
anything to worry about,

14:26.735 --> 14:29.339
but you know,
I usually check testicles

14:29.427 --> 14:31.342
when they've been
smashed on the monkey bars

14:31.430 --> 14:33.780
or smashed on the bike bars
or smashed with a baseball.

14:33.868 --> 14:36.464
- You know, smash-related ouchies.
- Uh-huh.

14:36.583 --> 14:39.792
But I think it wouldn't hurt if
you were to see an adult doctor.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.561
Um, since that's what you are.

14:43.276 --> 14:45.128
So you won't be
my doctor anymore?

14:45.216 --> 14:47.448
Good luck, son.
Oh, and don't forget

14:47.536 --> 14:49.753
to stop at the treasure chest
on the way out.

14:49.849 --> 14:51.167
Thank you for everything
everything, Doctor.

14:51.255 --> 14:54.120
Oh, let's hold that hug
until you pull those pants up.

14:54.300 --> 14:55.573
Okay.

14:58.669 --> 15:00.464
All right, it's just a cyst,
it's harmless,

15:00.552 --> 15:01.815
nothing to worry about.

15:01.931 --> 15:05.448
- That's a relief. I'm so glad I did this.
- Actually,

15:05.543 --> 15:07.458
before you get dressed, I want
to rule out one other thing.

15:07.638 --> 15:09.052
Okay, no problem.

15:09.140 --> 15:10.755
Turn around,
put your elbows on the table.

15:10.904 --> 15:12.565
Try not to clench.

15:14.792 --> 15:16.698
Why would I clench?

15:17.128 --> 15:19.597
Great attitude.

15:19.779 --> 15:22.595
Thank you...

15:24.089 --> 15:25.784
Is this a real test?

15:29.566 --> 15:31.479
<font color=#FFFF00>Story Four:</font>
<font color=#00ff00>John Divorce Dilemma</font>

15:34.138 --> 15:35.425
It's happened.

15:35.786 --> 15:38.370
I got horrible news
about my dad.

15:38.512 --> 15:40.828
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

15:41.138 --> 15:43.685
And he almost made it to 100.

15:43.903 --> 15:47.192
No, no.
My mom's leaving him.

15:47.388 --> 15:48.970
At the mortuary?

15:49.234 --> 15:50.896
No, he's not dead.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.449
My mom wants a divorce.
She's leaving him.

15:53.552 --> 15:56.325
Well, she's bedridden.
How can she leave anyone?

15:56.413 --> 15:58.091
You know,
I'm from a broken home now.

15:58.179 --> 15:59.528
I'm a latchkey kid.

15:59.616 --> 16:02.331
No, sweetie.
That's only if you're preadolescent.

16:02.432 --> 16:04.325
Aw, hell.
I got to spend Christmas

16:04.413 --> 16:07.075
going to two separate
nursing homes?

16:12.129 --> 16:15.075
I don't know what you're making,
but it better be pureed.

16:15.193 --> 16:17.630
My parents are coming
for dinner tonight.

16:17.837 --> 16:19.263
What are you up to?

16:19.351 --> 16:21.872
Well, my parents, uh,
they need a reminder

16:21.960 --> 16:24.693
of why they fell in love,
so tonight I'm playing Cupid.

16:24.781 --> 16:28.044
Uh, do you remember when
you built that wooden menorah

16:28.132 --> 16:30.193
- for your friend Shlomo?
- Yeah.

16:30.281 --> 16:34.396
Yeah, right. And he stayed
with us for two months

16:34.499 --> 16:35.818
while they rebuilt
his house

16:35.906 --> 16:37.454
- after the fire?
-Yeah. Mm.

16:38.109 --> 16:41.005
That was a better idea
than this.

16:43.519 --> 16:46.724
Oh! Maybe we should
do this one at a time.

16:46.812 --> 16:49.327
Well, they're lovebirds.
They want to be together.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.075
You're hurting me!

16:51.163 --> 16:53.011
Oh!

16:53.099 --> 16:55.101
See? They just get each other.

17:01.216 --> 17:03.357
Take as much time as you need.

17:03.627 --> 17:04.973
Oh, shut up.

17:05.109 --> 17:06.425
Hey, wow.

17:06.574 --> 17:09.301
Mom, Dad, um, I've got an idea.

17:09.390 --> 17:11.439
Tell us how you first met.

17:11.548 --> 17:14.318
We were set up by
her friend Vivian.

17:15.078 --> 17:17.090
She was buxom.

17:17.557 --> 17:19.592
And a communist.

17:20.666 --> 17:21.749
Ha.

17:21.837 --> 17:23.344
- Honey...
- What?

17:23.432 --> 17:26.051
Would you help me
grind the steak, please?

17:26.676 --> 17:28.482
She was a socialist.

17:28.833 --> 17:30.286
I think it's so good

17:30.374 --> 17:32.723
that you're trying to save
your parents' marriage.

17:32.817 --> 17:35.900
But they really don't have
anything in common anymore.

17:36.027 --> 17:38.008
Joanie, what dinner are you at?

17:38.501 --> 17:41.817
You know, that stuff about
Vivian the buxom communist...

17:41.905 --> 17:42.919
It's electric.

17:43.007 --> 17:45.036
We've been sitting there
for over an hour

17:45.130 --> 17:47.045
and they've barely said
a word to each other.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.714
They're agreeing on everything.

17:48.823 --> 17:51.776
Don't you understand, Joanie?
If they get divorced,

17:51.864 --> 17:53.159
it changes everything.

17:53.247 --> 17:54.854
All my memories are lies.

17:54.942 --> 17:58.268
The birthdays, the holidays,
it's... they're all gone.

17:58.356 --> 17:59.437
No, honey.

17:59.533 --> 18:01.995
I remember when
Martin Luther King was shot,

18:02.083 --> 18:05.512
and-and I was devastated,
and they took me to the movies

18:05.600 --> 18:08.049
and they gave me popcorn,
and for two hours,

18:08.159 --> 18:11.315
everything was normal,
everything was okay.

18:11.403 --> 18:13.619
No, we watched that on Mad Men.

18:13.777 --> 18:17.014
Do you have to crap
on all my memories, Joanie?

18:19.986 --> 18:23.346
Oh, wow. And here's us
camping in the Sierras.

18:23.555 --> 18:26.768
Huh? Hey, Dad,
doesn't Mom look beautiful?

18:27.014 --> 18:28.896
She looks like Moe Howard.

18:28.984 --> 18:31.532
Well, a-a sexy Moe Howard, huh?

18:31.620 --> 18:35.104
Uh, and doesn't Dad
look handsome?

18:35.192 --> 18:37.040
He was a bad lover.

18:37.128 --> 18:40.167
It's hard to get tight in
the undies with Moe Howard.

18:41.635 --> 18:44.185
Okay, enough.

18:44.522 --> 18:47.253
I don't understand why you're
acting like you hate each other.

18:47.341 --> 18:49.184
Huh? You've...
You guys have had

18:49.272 --> 18:51.971
a beautiful marriage
for 70 years.

18:52.129 --> 18:54.018
Why throw it away now?

18:54.106 --> 18:55.768
We've always hated each other.

18:55.856 --> 18:57.987
We only stayed together for you.

18:58.395 --> 18:59.487
What?

18:59.575 --> 19:01.393
But you are so healthy,

19:01.556 --> 19:03.784
we realize we're not
gonna outlive you.

19:03.872 --> 19:07.356
The plan was to stay together
until I died?

19:08.045 --> 19:09.596
You were a fighter pilot.

19:09.897 --> 19:11.897
We just assumed.

19:12.118 --> 19:15.514
So you were disappointed
when I came home alive?

19:19.857 --> 19:21.738
Look, I-I just don't understand.

19:21.825 --> 19:25.909
I mean, you guys are
in your 90s, why split up now?

19:25.996 --> 19:27.565
I want to play the field.

19:27.860 --> 19:30.256
I think I might be into guys.

19:31.326 --> 19:32.639
Huh.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.959
So I need to give up the fight
to keep them together.

19:39.047 --> 19:42.430
Yeah. My only regret is you
didn't try and stop me sooner.

19:42.642 --> 19:45.491
Yes. I-I regret that, too.

19:45.616 --> 19:48.166
Mm-hmm. It's a sad day for me,
but I'm gonna tell them

19:48.253 --> 19:52.585
that I'm gonna handle
all the details of the divorce.

19:56.561 --> 19:59.350
Dad, is Mom okay?

20:00.006 --> 20:02.079
No, I think she died.

20:02.428 --> 20:03.889
Oh.

20:04.538 --> 20:06.694
Oh, no.

20:06.994 --> 20:08.545
- Oh, son.
- Hmm?

20:08.673 --> 20:11.311
Could you help me install Grindr
on my smartphone?

20:14.595 --> 20:16.510
Thank you so much.

20:16.620 --> 20:18.139
Bye-bye.

20:18.752 --> 20:21.268
All right, sweetie.
We're all set.

20:22.139 --> 20:24.678
I think it's gonna be
a very nice service.

20:26.157 --> 20:27.553
What?

20:28.381 --> 20:29.908
Oh, they made it, Joanie.

20:30.010 --> 20:32.236
70 loving years of marriage.
