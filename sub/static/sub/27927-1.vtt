02:20.132 --> 02:20.965
What are you doing, Jackson?

02:20.965 --> 02:21.798
Oh, I, I'm sorry...

02:21.799 --> 02:24.229
Come here, come here.
How was your sleep?

02:26.020 --> 02:28.719
What'd I tell you about
that cereal box, huh?

02:28.720 --> 02:29.849
Never touch it.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.549
Never look at it, right?
I'm hungry, Uncle Jay.

02:31.550 --> 02:33.001
Oh, what's that?

02:33.002 --> 02:35.429
Come here, what's that?

02:35.430 --> 02:37.089
I just wanted some cereal.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.463
You wanted some cereal?

02:40.573 --> 02:41.699
Get out.

02:41.700 --> 02:42.700
Get out.

02:42.701 --> 02:44.439
Uncle Jay, I got no place to go.

02:44.440 --> 02:47.109
I am not your uncle.

02:47.110 --> 02:49.089
I'm sorry, it's gonna
never happen again, okay?

02:49.090 --> 02:49.923
I promise.

02:49.924 --> 02:52.113
As of right now I'm reducing
my carbon footprint.

02:57.850 --> 02:58.773
It's Vaseline.

02:59.627 --> 03:00.544
Ah.

03:32.347 --> 03:37.347
<i>♪ Oh no, wait another minute
to my time that comes ♪</i>

03:38.014 --> 03:40.380
<i>♪ It's just no fun ♪</i>

03:40.381 --> 03:41.993
<i>♪ Fuck that, I'm done ♪</i>

03:41.994 --> 03:46.994

03:49.632 --> 03:52.965

04:13.820 --> 04:14.653
Jackson.

04:14.654 --> 04:16.999
Hey, Maeve, did you get my voicemail?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.059
No.

04:18.060 --> 04:20.869
Oh, well, I was kinda wondering maybe,

04:20.870 --> 04:24.069
if I could stay with
you for a little while?

04:24.070 --> 04:26.679
No, you really need to let go of this.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.569
You know I can't do that,
Maeve, we're connected.

04:28.570 --> 04:29.403
All right, bye.

04:29.404 --> 04:31.665
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:31.666 --> 04:33.249
I shoulda done this a long time ago.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.543
You did, I said no.

04:36.620 --> 04:38.169
Will you marry me?

04:38.170 --> 04:39.839
Absolutely not, get up.

04:39.840 --> 04:40.673
Look, if you need more time.

04:40.674 --> 04:41.969
Hey, come on, get outa here.
I completely understand.

04:41.970 --> 04:44.339
Oh Maeve, your hands, are you okay?

04:44.340 --> 04:45.173
Yeah.

04:46.050 --> 04:47.010
I don't burn that fast,

04:47.011 --> 04:49.360
that's not how photo-sensitivity
works, Jackson.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.483
Okay, well I'm gonna use your restroom.

05:09.050 --> 05:10.459
I'm on my period.

05:10.460 --> 05:11.599
That's what that was.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.433
I didn't say anything.

05:12.434 --> 05:14.139
Well you didn't flush, so.

05:14.140 --> 05:15.575
Oh.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.670
Gonna leave a ring.

05:25.800 --> 05:26.660
Smells good in here.

05:26.661 --> 05:28.179
Yup.

05:28.180 --> 05:30.019
Okay, it was good to see you.

05:30.020 --> 05:30.853
Bye.

05:32.380 --> 05:33.611
You got a little
sunscreen on your sunnies.

05:33.612 --> 05:35.017
Oh, oh.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.670
Forgot I was wearing those.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.703
Jackson, we broke up.

05:50.139 --> 05:51.839
And it wasn't temporary, you know.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.499
You need to move on.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.509
I've told you that like eight times.

05:56.510 --> 05:58.139
I feel like if you play it all eight times

05:58.140 --> 06:00.829
on a loop you would maybe get it.

06:00.830 --> 06:02.789
Look, I know your mom died,

06:02.790 --> 06:03.623
and you pushing me away.
No, it has nothing

06:03.624 --> 06:04.773
to do with my mom.

06:06.687 --> 06:07.745
Well, Maeve, I.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.467
God my neck.

06:16.133 --> 06:18.533
Just don't come here
anymore, Jackson, please.

06:22.140 --> 06:22.973
All right.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Another time maybe.

06:29.001 --> 06:30.350
Are you freakin' serious?

06:46.890 --> 06:49.869
Jackson, get in the car.

06:49.870 --> 06:51.589
I crossed the line today, Uncle Jay.

06:51.590 --> 06:53.140
There's no ignoring that, okay?

06:54.430 --> 06:55.869
Get in the car, Jackson.

06:55.870 --> 06:57.168
No sir.

06:57.169 --> 07:00.251
Lucinda's been nice enough to
let me stay in her backyard.

07:00.252 --> 07:02.889
, Lucinda.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.239
Get in the car, Jackson.

07:05.240 --> 07:06.940
Nope, I'm planting my flag here.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.273
I'm all set up, my tent looks good.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.219
This is gonna be my new home
for a long time, I think.

07:15.220 --> 07:17.179
This is a very nice location for me.

07:17.180 --> 07:18.013
Yeah.

07:21.035 --> 07:22.735
, yeah.

07:39.430 --> 07:40.293
Get in the car.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.403
Other side.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.029
No.

07:53.030 --> 07:54.909
Yeah, no, no, April.

07:54.910 --> 07:56.733
Now stop interrupting me, please.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.853
'Cause he's your responsibility.

08:01.030 --> 08:01.980
Oh, okay.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.430
Yeah, well you're sister
of the year, aren't you?

08:05.309 --> 08:06.469
Oh, do it, do it.

08:06.470 --> 08:08.949
I dare you, I dare you.

08:14.340 --> 08:15.300
How's mom?

08:15.301 --> 08:17.259
My sister is not your mom, Jackson.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.560
She was married to your
dad for a month, okay?

08:21.038 --> 08:21.990
I'm starting to get
the feeling she doesn't

08:21.991 --> 08:23.699
want me around anymore, Uncle Jay.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.849
Well, uh, that's probably
because that's true, all right?

08:26.850 --> 08:27.959
You're not one of those people who has

08:27.960 --> 08:30.410
an indicator that you've
overstayed your welcome.

08:36.610 --> 08:37.979
Are you hungry?

08:37.980 --> 08:40.639
I'm making a burrito,
do you want a burrito?

08:40.640 --> 08:41.490
Yeah.

08:42.821 --> 08:43.899
Okay.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.109
Thanks, Uncle Jay.

08:45.110 --> 08:45.960
You're welcome.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.739
And clean your tent.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.133
It smells like SARS.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.669
Thanks for taking me back in, Uncle Jay.

09:45.670 --> 09:46.953
Uh huh.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.793
I'm gonna buy you another
box of Mandao's, I promise.

09:54.450 --> 09:57.549
No you're not, Jackson,
because that was the last cereal

09:57.550 --> 10:00.263
box ever made while my
dad still owned Mandao's.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.692
Okay?

10:02.693 --> 10:03.633
It was priceless.

10:04.884 --> 10:06.799
Well don't you get like
royalty checks or something,

10:06.800 --> 10:08.543
every time somebody buys a box?

10:10.460 --> 10:15.460
I meant love priceless
not money priceless.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.129
Think I'm gonna go with
Rick the ghost this year,

10:32.130 --> 10:33.437
what do you think?

12:04.573 --> 12:06.212
Uncle Jay.

12:06.213 --> 12:07.296
Hey, wake up.

12:12.602 --> 12:13.802
Come on, Uncle Jay.

12:13.803 --> 12:15.322
You're having a nightmare, wake up.

12:15.323 --> 12:16.351
What?

12:16.352 --> 12:18.833
Uncle Jay, Uncle Jay.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.780
Jackson.
Wake up.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.021
Wake up.

12:22.022 --> 12:24.522
Uncle Jay, Uncle Jay, wake up.

12:25.622 --> 12:27.681
Hey, Jackson, stop.

12:27.682 --> 12:30.301
Snap out of it,
snap out of it Uncle Jay.

12:30.302 --> 12:31.676
Come on, Jackson, stop!

12:31.677 --> 12:34.709
Come on, wake up, hey, wake up...

12:34.710 --> 12:37.293
Stop!

12:39.060 --> 12:40.727
Are you all right?

12:41.910 --> 12:43.063
You okay?
Yeah.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.767
Looked like you were having
a nightmare or somethin'.

13:04.898 --> 13:05.981
Good morning.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.113
Yeah.

13:23.205 --> 13:26.169
You get back to sleep last night?

13:26.170 --> 13:28.919
Oh yeah, I sunk right into the floor.

13:28.920 --> 13:29.753
How about you?

13:30.590 --> 13:31.423
No.

13:34.010 --> 13:38.143
I've been having these dreams lately.

13:39.310 --> 13:42.969
I'm at the apartment, everything
is the same except that

13:42.970 --> 13:47.443
the bathroom door has a bright
light shining from behind it,

13:48.380 --> 13:51.563
but I can't ever, I can't ever open it.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.180
Sounds mystical.

13:57.740 --> 13:59.779
I saw you waking me up last night.

13:59.780 --> 14:01.879
You saw me?
Yeah.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.603
But from outside of my body.

14:04.930 --> 14:07.391
That sounds like you're
astral projecting, man.

14:07.392 --> 14:08.263
You lucky duck.

14:09.160 --> 14:10.610
Astral projecting?
Yeah.

14:12.676 --> 14:14.799
I saw this movie on it once.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.739
This girl would like go to
sleep and when she was asleep

14:17.740 --> 14:21.537
her spirit would go wherever she wanted.

14:23.008 --> 14:23.925
Hm.

14:27.550 --> 14:29.597
Died in the end, though.

15:07.887 --> 15:10.672
I love this song.

15:10.673 --> 15:12.729
It's a classic choice.

15:12.730 --> 15:14.899
Yeah, cheap and tasty.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.124
I meant your costume.

15:16.125 --> 15:20.629
Oh, I like yours too,
it's very um, it's current.

15:20.630 --> 15:21.463
Thanks.

15:23.020 --> 15:23.950
Jackson.

15:23.950 --> 15:24.783
Maeve.

15:27.510 --> 15:28.582
How do you know the host?

15:28.583 --> 15:29.416
I don't.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.437
Smelled the cheese plate and came runnin'.

15:34.570 --> 15:36.239
How do you know the host?

15:36.240 --> 15:38.443
Oh, I've lived inside her since birth.

15:40.780 --> 15:41.634
I'm the host.

15:41.635 --> 15:43.709
Oh, oh, my God.

15:43.710 --> 15:44.543
That's funny.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.986
It's a pretty tight party.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.592
Yeah, I don't really know
like half these people.

15:49.593 --> 15:51.079
Yeah, right there.

15:51.080 --> 15:51.913
Pose it.

15:52.828 --> 15:53.661
Yeah.

15:54.656 --> 15:57.178
Jackson, Jackson, come here.

15:57.179 --> 15:58.319
Holy moly.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.729
Oh, you're bleeding.

15:59.730 --> 16:01.825
Yeah, this damn toothpick cut me.

16:01.826 --> 16:02.995
Okay, come with me.

16:02.996 --> 16:03.913
Oh, okay.

16:05.770 --> 16:08.029
Yeah.
Yeah, come on, come on.

16:08.030 --> 16:10.038
Twist it, yeah, woo!

16:10.039 --> 16:10.872
Oh yeah!

16:18.420 --> 16:19.253
Research?

16:21.060 --> 16:21.960
Guilty pleasure.

16:27.330 --> 16:29.234
Oh, that's, that's for my mom.

16:29.235 --> 16:30.140
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:30.141 --> 16:31.243
No, it's okay.

16:32.260 --> 16:35.060
Yeah, there was an incident,
but she's doing better now.

16:36.380 --> 16:39.419
I'm actually moving back
in with her next week.

16:39.420 --> 16:40.970
I'll be her own personal nurse.

16:42.720 --> 16:46.483
Hm, well you know, you're a vampire,

16:48.060 --> 16:52.523
I'm a vampire, we could just
turn her into a vampire.

16:58.630 --> 17:00.523
That was really insensitive.

17:01.934 --> 17:02.983
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:04.060 --> 17:05.510
Seriously.
Just kidding.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.399
I am really glad you called me, Jay.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.209
How long did it take
you to astral project?

17:35.210 --> 17:36.629
A year?

17:36.630 --> 17:37.859
Two years?

17:37.860 --> 17:39.699
No, Andy, I just started.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.719
You know, I'm not even trying.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.369
Is that normal?

17:43.370 --> 17:45.403
Oh, this is fucking bullshit.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.289
This doesn't make sense.

17:52.290 --> 17:53.880
Either this runs in the family

17:54.910 --> 17:56.560
or you were chosen for something.

17:57.900 --> 17:58.993
Me, chosen?

17:59.910 --> 18:02.099
I don't think you were
chosen for anything, okay?

18:02.100 --> 18:03.699
You would think that that would
be reserved for someone who

18:03.700 --> 18:07.263
spent most of their life and
finances on the cosmic cause.

18:10.460 --> 18:14.229
I'm not talking about me,
I am talking about others.

18:14.230 --> 18:16.783
If it runs in the family,
when do I get my abilities?

18:17.840 --> 18:19.143
Soon, probably.

18:21.010 --> 18:22.289
Soon.

18:22.290 --> 18:23.349
Yeah?
Well let's make sure

18:23.350 --> 18:24.819
that you're actually astraling

18:24.820 --> 18:27.969
and not just having a slight
out of body experience.

18:27.970 --> 18:31.009
Okay, I'll come back here
later tonight in astral form.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.749
Here, take this.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.169
What's this?

18:34.170 --> 18:37.709
That will get you into
some deep astral travel.

18:37.710 --> 18:40.279
It has a few side effects,
but don't worry, it's fine.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.679
I've been takin' it for years.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.713
Ah.

18:45.310 --> 18:46.319
Well, thanks man.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.483
That's 10 bucks.

18:48.580 --> 18:49.729
Dude, we're cousins.

18:49.730 --> 18:51.913
Yeah, this is a family discount.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.539
Are you okay?

18:55.540 --> 18:56.486
I'm fine.

19:00.910 --> 19:02.442
Hey, Uncle Jay.

19:02.443 --> 19:05.603
What?

19:05.604 --> 19:06.937
How do I look?

19:12.280 --> 19:15.669
You look like a scrote with a cape.

19:15.670 --> 19:16.890
Really?

19:16.891 --> 19:17.808
Uh, yeah.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.959
Can I talk to you?

19:26.960 --> 19:27.793
Yeah.

19:34.300 --> 19:35.889
Come here.

19:35.890 --> 19:38.889
You let a guest into my
bathroom and she pooped.

19:38.890 --> 19:40.569
What are we gonna do about that?

19:40.570 --> 19:41.749
It's Fer.

19:41.750 --> 19:42.583
You know Fer.

19:45.311 --> 19:48.149
I love you.

19:48.150 --> 19:48.983
No, no, no.

19:50.713 --> 19:51.546
No.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.929
Jackson said you'd pay me
for the last three rides.

19:55.930 --> 19:57.989
Well, Jackson was mistaken, Fer.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.719
There are 25 other Bum Ride drivers,

19:59.720 --> 20:01.059
that you only call me?

20:01.060 --> 20:04.049
Well, I told you not to
give Jackson your number, so.

20:04.050 --> 20:05.849
Look, I'm not leaving without my money,

20:05.850 --> 20:07.429
unless you want me to stay.

20:07.430 --> 20:09.073
You want me to stay?

20:10.070 --> 20:13.569
You know what, I'm not
gonna pay you for Bum Rides,

20:13.570 --> 20:14.789
but I will pay you to leave.

20:14.790 --> 20:16.050
How much is that gonna cost me?

20:17.530 --> 20:20.223
61.79, plus tip.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.736
Where is it you even go?

20:24.737 --> 20:25.839
Maeve's.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.783
Well get her to pay for it then, huh?

20:35.980 --> 20:37.227
Happy Halloween.

21:39.471 --> 21:40.304
Whose car is that?

21:43.820 --> 21:44.653
All right, Fer.

21:46.086 --> 21:47.779
I'd really appreciate it if
you wait here for me, okay?

21:47.780 --> 21:49.089
I'll be right back.

21:49.090 --> 21:49.923
Hey, man.

21:51.100 --> 21:51.933
How old are you?

21:52.880 --> 21:53.979
33.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.929
Okay, well you gotta start
paying for your own way

21:56.930 --> 21:58.529
and stop using Jay's money,

21:58.530 --> 22:01.583
'cause it makes things really
awkward for me, you know?

22:02.510 --> 22:05.859
I mean, do you have any
concept of like rent or bills

22:05.860 --> 22:07.653
or student loans or anything?

22:08.560 --> 22:09.473
Student loans?

22:10.332 --> 22:11.170
I don't know.

22:11.171 --> 22:13.609
Okay, meter's running dude.

22:13.610 --> 22:14.610
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

22:35.664 --> 22:40.059
Hey, Jackson.
Yeah?

22:40.060 --> 22:40.893
Nice costume.

22:43.543 --> 22:44.876
Appreciate it.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.158
Aw, shit.

23:39.159 --> 23:40.040
Andy.

23:40.041 --> 23:42.149
So you can astral project.

23:42.150 --> 23:43.898
Doesn't mean you were chosen though.

23:43.899 --> 23:44.899
Come here.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.053
Wow.

23:50.050 --> 23:52.529
That's a lot of energy
coming out of there.

23:52.530 --> 23:54.659
That's the light I've been seeing, Andy.

23:54.660 --> 23:57.160
I think that's what's been
giving me my abilities.

23:58.595 --> 23:59.639
You know, but I'm not a professional.

23:59.640 --> 24:00.723
What do you think?

24:00.724 --> 24:01.557
Come on, man, what's going on?

24:01.558 --> 24:02.769
What is that?
Okay, okay.

24:02.770 --> 24:04.360
Well, it could be a portal

24:05.290 --> 24:07.090
or you could be channeling the dead.

24:08.330 --> 24:09.630
Or it could be a gas leak.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.479
I have to go to an astral convention.

24:13.480 --> 24:14.959
Do you wanna come?

24:14.960 --> 24:16.509
Sure, sure.

24:16.510 --> 24:18.740
It's 50 bucks at the door.

24:18.741 --> 24:21.159
Okay, 50 bucks?

24:21.160 --> 24:22.399
What do they use, astral money?

24:22.400 --> 24:24.493
Bitcoin, weirdly enough.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.428
Come on, Andy please.

24:28.429 --> 24:29.799
Mandao boys, like when we were kids.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.812
No, no, no, no.
Let's have an adventure.

24:30.813 --> 24:32.469
Please?
No, no, okay?

24:32.470 --> 24:35.899
Why don't you just come and
meet me at the convention later?

24:35.900 --> 24:37.789
How, I don't even know where it is.

24:37.790 --> 24:38.936
You don't have to know where it is,

24:38.937 --> 24:41.179
you just have to know someone
there, and I'll be there.

24:41.180 --> 24:44.723
So you just picture me and
you'll project to wherever I am.

24:48.000 --> 24:48.833
Andy.
Bye.

25:27.443 --> 25:28.843
Like the toy?

25:28.844 --> 25:29.839
It's all right.

25:29.840 --> 25:32.089
Just all right?

25:37.005 --> 25:37.838
Again?

25:39.100 --> 25:41.159
No, I'm not eating this again.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.109
I'll go grocery shopping
tomorrow, all right.

25:43.110 --> 25:44.760
You can grab a donut if you want.

25:46.590 --> 25:49.329
Jay, quit.

25:49.330 --> 25:51.619
Guess what Daniel Piller told me today?

25:51.620 --> 25:52.540
What did he tell ya?

25:52.541 --> 25:55.663
He told me you and mom got
divorced three months ago.

26:00.914 --> 26:05.166
I don't want you hanging
around with Daniel Piller.

26:05.167 --> 26:07.319
Kinda stupid name is that anyway?

26:07.320 --> 26:08.403
Is it true?

26:10.020 --> 26:12.986
Well, I guess I got my answer.

26:12.987 --> 26:16.406
What kinda stupid name is Mandao's.

26:39.510 --> 26:42.473
Picture me, and you'll
project to wherever I am.

27:10.070 --> 27:11.670
Yo, what do you want, Jackson?

27:17.520 --> 27:19.359
She has a type.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.012
It's better this way, Jackson.

27:23.824 --> 27:24.657
Jackson.

27:26.614 --> 27:27.697
I can't move.

27:30.074 --> 27:30.907
Jackson.

27:38.314 --> 27:39.481
Jackson, help.

27:40.804 --> 27:41.637
My legs.

27:43.285 --> 27:44.765
Jackson!

27:44.766 --> 27:45.599
Jackson!

27:46.727 --> 27:47.894
Fer, Fer, Fer.

27:54.132 --> 27:54.965
Fer.

28:05.575 --> 28:08.492
I'll see you guys at the apartment.

28:09.963 --> 28:14.263
Hey, hey do you see me?

28:16.377 --> 28:17.210
Dude, this is awesome.

28:17.211 --> 28:21.177
Come on, come on, I gotta
show you something, come on.

28:36.290 --> 28:37.123
Jay.

28:39.808 --> 28:40.641
Dad?

28:42.720 --> 28:43.553
Jay.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.639
Hello?
Yeah, no, yes, hello.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.819
Yeah, I still haven't
received my royalty checks,

28:59.820 --> 29:01.083
I've been on all morning.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.989
Jamison Ray Mandao.

29:04.990 --> 29:06.309
Raymond Mandao?

29:06.310 --> 29:08.809
No, Raymond is my father.

29:08.810 --> 29:09.859
Uh huh.

29:09.860 --> 29:10.700
He's deceased.

29:10.701 --> 29:13.189
He's what?
Deceased.

29:13.190 --> 29:16.649
What?
Deceased!

29:16.650 --> 29:18.739
Can you spell it?
No, I will not spell

29:18.740 --> 29:19.743
it for you.

29:23.750 --> 29:26.969
No, you just need to stop sometimes

29:26.970 --> 29:30.133
and get rid of the stupid, you know?

29:35.040 --> 29:37.239
Then, thank you, that's good, thanks.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.832
How was, how was your sleep?

29:39.833 --> 29:42.699
I don't wanna talk right now, Uncle Jay.

29:42.700 --> 29:43.533
Fine.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.949
Maeve's seeing somebody.

29:46.950 --> 29:49.600
Well, that's a side effect
of breaking up, Jackson.

29:50.870 --> 29:52.359
The guys a circle.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.029
Boring little circle.

29:54.030 --> 29:57.689
And the next time I see
him, I'm gonna whip his ass.

29:57.690 --> 29:59.569
Well, if you had stayed
around a little longer

29:59.570 --> 30:02.029
last night you would've had your chance.

30:02.030 --> 30:04.539
Yeah, I was astral projecting.

30:04.540 --> 30:07.929
Yeah, and I'm gettin' pretty
frickin' good at it, man.

30:07.930 --> 30:11.229
When you left, there was a
guy who came right up to me

30:11.230 --> 30:13.883
and he asked me, can you see me?

30:15.298 --> 30:16.378
Was he wearing a...

30:16.379 --> 30:17.869
Skeleton shirt.
Skeleton shirt?

30:17.870 --> 30:18.773
Circle boy.

30:19.900 --> 30:21.659
Are you trying to say square or?

30:21.660 --> 30:22.493
I didn't think people could

30:22.494 --> 30:24.563
see you when you astral project.

30:25.690 --> 30:26.640
Well, they can't.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.309
I'm going over there.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.653
Can I get dressed first?

30:40.920 --> 30:42.173
Yup, still there.

30:43.181 --> 30:44.779
Doesn't that asshole
have a job or something?

30:44.780 --> 30:47.101
Does anyone in this
car have a job, Jackson?

30:47.102 --> 30:47.935
I do.

30:49.980 --> 30:51.893
Whoa ho, whoa, there she is.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.439
Gosh, why is she dressed like that?

30:55.440 --> 30:57.069
It's California Jackson, it's fine.

30:57.070 --> 30:57.960
Come on, leave her alone.

30:57.961 --> 30:59.569
Yeah, I know, it's California, okay?

30:59.570 --> 31:00.769
But she's allergic to sunlight.

31:00.770 --> 31:02.239
Oh, yeah.

31:02.240 --> 31:03.533
Get down, get down.

31:07.830 --> 31:09.509
Come on, Uncle Jay.

31:09.510 --> 31:13.309
Hey, hey, why does your
finger smell like that?

31:13.310 --> 31:15.379
My toilet paper ripped.

31:15.380 --> 31:16.718
I'm staying with Fer.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.729
Stop shocking me.

31:20.730 --> 31:22.765
Come on, Uncle Jay.
Hey!

31:26.730 --> 31:28.775
Probably spooked
him and he ran off.

31:28.776 --> 31:30.019
That's what I'd do if I was circle.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.573
Hm, yeah, I'm sure you would.

31:33.070 --> 31:34.200
Come on, don't do that.

31:34.201 --> 31:35.760
Don't.
I think I...

31:35.761 --> 31:36.623
Jackson.

31:36.624 --> 31:37.843
I can't see him.

31:38.963 --> 31:39.960
I see something there.

31:39.960 --> 31:40.793
What, what?

31:40.793 --> 31:41.626
There's no one in there.

31:41.626 --> 31:42.459
Come on.

31:44.030 --> 31:44.863
Come on.

31:46.589 --> 31:48.133
All right, Uncle Jay, let's go.

32:00.620 --> 32:01.453
Yup, here it is.

32:01.454 --> 32:02.659
She always leaves me a key.

32:02.660 --> 32:05.349
I don't think that's for you, Jackson.

32:05.350 --> 32:06.889
Hey, hey, Jackson.

32:06.890 --> 32:08.029
Stop.

32:08.030 --> 32:09.646
No.

32:09.647 --> 32:11.288
No.

32:11.289 --> 32:12.122
No.

32:15.690 --> 32:17.363
Hey fella, you in here?

32:18.422 --> 32:19.733
We just wanna talk.

32:20.583 --> 32:24.425
All right, I'm gonna go
this way, you go that way.

32:24.426 --> 32:25.259
Let's go.

33:10.070 --> 33:10.910
Hey man, I'm Darth.

33:10.911 --> 33:13.309
Wait.
Relax, I'm cool all right?

33:13.310 --> 33:17.149
I just, I'm excited to see you man.

33:17.150 --> 33:18.579
Come follow me, I got
something to show you.

33:18.580 --> 33:19.413
Come on.

33:20.990 --> 33:21.823
Uh.

34:18.760 --> 34:19.592
Open the door.

34:21.530 --> 34:23.109
No.

34:23.110 --> 34:23.993
I can't do it.

34:25.270 --> 34:27.268
You can't open the door?

34:27.270 --> 34:28.509
No.

34:28.510 --> 34:29.342
Is this what this has all been about?

34:29.344 --> 34:30.799
You want me to open a door?

34:30.800 --> 34:32.659
Look, I'm not trying to be
shady or anything, all right?

34:32.659 --> 34:35.309
I just, you came back here.

34:35.310 --> 34:37.333
I think that's pretty indicative of,

34:38.360 --> 34:39.560
it just means something.

34:43.679 --> 34:45.179
Okay, all right, I'll do it.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.072
Now I just.

35:10.092 --> 35:10.925
Ah, ah!

35:15.055 --> 35:16.638
I need your help.

35:28.621 --> 35:30.436
Don't mind if I do.

35:30.437 --> 35:31.854
This looks clean.

35:37.683 --> 35:40.013
Jesus, woman, it's called
an expiration date.

35:43.672 --> 35:44.839
A little more.

35:57.540 --> 35:59.902
Hey Uncle Jay, I found
something kind of interesting.

35:59.903 --> 36:01.609
Did you know that Maeve was fired

36:01.610 --> 36:03.510
from the blood-bank for stealing blood?

36:05.029 --> 36:06.529
Doesn't really sound like her.

36:08.740 --> 36:09.653
Do you see him?

36:10.630 --> 36:12.129
See who?

36:12.130 --> 36:12.963
Him!

36:12.964 --> 36:14.219
You all right, Uncle Jay?

36:14.220 --> 36:15.053
Don't touch me.

36:15.054 --> 36:16.079
Oh, I'm sorry.
Don't touch me.

36:16.080 --> 36:18.032
Just, maybe could you go in there?

36:18.033 --> 36:20.009
I don't wanna go in there.

36:20.010 --> 36:20.843
Please.

36:21.790 --> 36:22.623
Please.

36:34.497 --> 36:35.360
I see him.

36:35.361 --> 36:36.749
Do you see him?

36:36.750 --> 36:38.139
What are you talking about?

36:38.140 --> 36:40.559
No.
Where are you going?

36:40.560 --> 36:41.810
Wait, you're his uncle?

36:57.670 --> 37:00.379
So that kid killed
himself in Maeve's garage.

37:00.380 --> 37:02.219
I mean, why would he do that?

37:02.220 --> 37:03.789
Change it to an AM channel,

37:03.790 --> 37:05.429
this guy is starting to piss me off.

37:05.430 --> 37:06.493
All right.

37:09.085 --> 37:11.213
I don't think you should
be talking to it, Uncle Jay.

37:16.430 --> 37:17.263
What now?

37:17.264 --> 37:20.210
All right, so we gotta try
catching my voice using an EVP.

37:21.720 --> 37:23.019
What the hell is that?

37:23.020 --> 37:24.399
Electronic voice phenomenon, okay?

37:24.400 --> 37:25.750
Keep scanning the channels.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.760
I gotta focus my energy into the radio.

37:36.640 --> 37:41.701
If I'm not mistaken, my voice
should come out of the radio.

37:41.725 --> 37:42.580
Whoa, whoa.

37:42.581 --> 37:44.661
Wait, wait, go back, go back.

37:44.662 --> 37:45.586
Go back, go back.

37:45.587 --> 37:47.414
There, there I am.

37:47.415 --> 37:48.248
Oh, yes.

37:49.415 --> 37:50.915
We're in business.

37:52.550 --> 37:53.603
Okay.
Yes.

37:54.610 --> 37:56.289
All right.

37:56.290 --> 37:57.879
Where are you standing?

37:57.880 --> 37:59.769
Next to the map.

37:59.770 --> 38:01.507
What happened back there, Darth?

38:01.508 --> 38:02.341
Huh?

38:02.342 --> 38:04.229
Maeve dumped you and you
revengicide in her garage?

38:04.230 --> 38:05.629
What's your problem, man?

38:05.630 --> 38:07.739
I wanna know what your game is man.

38:07.740 --> 38:09.939
I'm dead, okay?

38:09.940 --> 38:11.423
Maeve killed me last night.

38:16.226 --> 38:18.789
But I think I found a loophole.

38:18.790 --> 38:21.389
You know that weird feeling
you get around Halloween time?

38:21.390 --> 38:22.559
Dude that's the veil.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.066
The veil between the living and the dead.

38:25.067 --> 38:27.603
And it's thinnest around Halloween time.

38:28.630 --> 38:30.909
You were astral projecting
last night, right?

38:30.910 --> 38:31.743
Yeah.

38:31.744 --> 38:34.233
I mean, do you do that often or what?

38:34.234 --> 38:35.299
I mean, I just started.

38:35.300 --> 38:36.379
You know, right I mean...

38:36.380 --> 38:38.529
Don't you think it's kinda
strange that you started

38:38.530 --> 38:41.380
getting your abilities around
the time that I was killed?

38:42.290 --> 38:45.149
I think our paths were
supposed to cross, man.

38:45.150 --> 38:48.053
I mean, I'm stuck in this
plane, but you're not.

38:49.350 --> 38:52.419
If you can somehow astral
project back in time and stop me

38:52.420 --> 38:55.383
from going to Maeve's, you
can bring me back, man.

38:56.290 --> 38:57.909
But you'd have to do it before

38:57.910 --> 38:59.860
the veil closes on the Day of the Dead.

39:01.820 --> 39:03.103
Stop you right there.

39:04.010 --> 39:05.533
When is the Day of the Dead?

39:07.620 --> 39:09.129
Midnight tonight.

39:09.130 --> 39:10.819
Don't listen to him, Uncle Jay.

39:10.820 --> 39:13.159
Maeve was just probably trying
to protect herself from him.

39:13.160 --> 39:13.993
Shut up.

39:13.994 --> 39:15.009
No, you shut up.

39:15.010 --> 39:16.000
You're idiot.
You're an idiot.

39:16.000 --> 39:16.833
He's an idiot.

39:16.833 --> 39:17.666
No, you're an idiot.

39:17.667 --> 39:18.825
You're an idiot.
You're an idiot.

39:18.826 --> 39:19.986
You're an idiot.

39:19.987 --> 39:21.759
You're an idiot, idiot.
Idiot.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.199
Look, if you can just go back, all right?

39:24.200 --> 39:25.329
Go back in time and you can see

39:25.330 --> 39:27.599
for yourselves what went down.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.489
I can astral project back in time?

39:30.490 --> 39:32.979
You are an astrotraveler, okay?

39:32.980 --> 39:34.069
With your abilities,

39:34.070 --> 39:36.409
you can defy the laws of time and space.

39:36.410 --> 39:39.333
You can travel to different
dimensions if you wanted to.

39:44.430 --> 39:46.599
Well, if you're goin', I'm goin' too.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.433
No, you're not.

39:47.434 --> 39:48.559
Yes, I am.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.463
Yeah, how are you gonna do that, genius?

39:51.470 --> 39:53.209
A little trick I picked up in Nam.

39:53.210 --> 39:55.909
Oh yeah, well, you
weren't in the Army, so.

39:55.910 --> 39:58.909
Okay, well, I saw a
YouTube video with a veteran,

39:58.910 --> 40:00.529
so it's basically the same thing.

40:00.530 --> 40:01.899
You're an ass-jacket.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.400
Just hold your horses, okay?

40:23.930 --> 40:24.763
You ready?

40:24.764 --> 40:26.709
I, go away.

40:26.710 --> 40:28.486
All right, I, all right.

40:34.986 --> 40:37.153
See you on the other side.

40:57.896 --> 40:59.615
Wake him up.

40:59.616 --> 41:01.195
How am I supposed to do that?

41:01.196 --> 41:04.529
How would you do it in the real world?

41:10.402 --> 41:11.235
Ow.

41:14.190 --> 41:16.179
I guess it didn't work, Uncle Jay.

41:16.180 --> 41:17.130
See for yourself.

41:21.370 --> 41:22.569
Whoa.

41:22.570 --> 41:24.142
Hey.

41:24.143 --> 41:24.976
Hey.

41:25.810 --> 41:27.399
So how do we go back in time.

41:27.400 --> 41:28.759
Right, okay, uh, look.

41:28.760 --> 41:29.635
Check it out.

41:29.635 --> 41:30.468
All right, let's imagine ourselves

41:30.469 --> 41:31.779
wearings wrist watches, okay?

41:31.780 --> 41:36.069
It should read October 31st,
9:30 p.m., okay that's around

41:36.070 --> 41:39.269
the time everything went
down that night, okay?

41:39.270 --> 41:42.999
Hey, Darth, how do
you know all this stuff?

41:43.000 --> 41:45.893
Oh, I took a semester
of paranormal sciences.

41:46.788 --> 41:47.871
Oh.
Yeah.

41:49.100 --> 41:49.933
Hey.

41:51.810 --> 41:52.643
I know Maeve.

41:54.410 --> 41:56.243
Yeah, me too.

41:58.130 --> 41:58.963
Yeah, but.

42:10.149 --> 42:12.066
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:14.617 --> 42:16.450
Wow, let's go.

42:23.973 --> 42:25.253
I should've done those things with her.

42:25.254 --> 42:26.775
I shoulda taken her dancing.

42:26.776 --> 42:28.388
You should've took her to counseling.

42:33.700 --> 42:34.709
Happy Halloween.

42:34.710 --> 42:36.160
You are everything.

42:42.670 --> 42:44.559
Extra large, yeah right.
All right.

42:44.560 --> 42:46.609
That's like wrapping a
grub worm in a tube sock.

42:46.610 --> 42:48.188
You're right.
Tell me I'm right.

42:48.189 --> 42:49.439
You're right.

42:53.050 --> 42:54.209
Just three?

42:54.210 --> 42:56.960
Yeah, I mean the security
at the blood-bank was tight.

42:58.410 --> 42:59.811
Look, I was thinking.

42:59.812 --> 43:03.052
Think we could just
relax tonight, you know?

43:03.053 --> 43:04.120
No, that's okay.

43:05.900 --> 43:06.733
Wait.

43:07.730 --> 43:09.429
But this is wine?

43:09.430 --> 43:10.263
I know.

43:10.264 --> 43:12.889
This is like shitty boxed wine.

43:12.890 --> 43:15.889
I know, it's just the place
was covered with security.

43:15.890 --> 43:18.040
I was ducking in the shadows over there.

43:19.014 --> 43:22.913
I'm getting, I'm gonna get
another shipment tomorrow, okay?

43:24.540 --> 43:26.056
You're mad.

43:26.057 --> 43:27.557
Hey, don't be mad.
I'm not.

43:29.654 --> 43:30.487
Okay.

43:42.740 --> 43:43.593
Sorry man.

43:45.573 --> 43:47.406
Come on, man.
Yeah.

43:56.630 --> 43:58.047
Let's get this over with.

44:02.597 --> 44:05.345
I'm sorry, I'll take it slow.

44:05.346 --> 44:08.179
It's okay, just go get the tarp.

44:09.271 --> 44:10.271
All right.

44:11.850 --> 44:13.767
Hasn't changed a bit.

44:23.379 --> 44:25.133
I'm ready for you.

44:29.694 --> 44:30.861
Turn around.

44:33.179 --> 44:35.659
All right.

44:35.660 --> 44:37.077
Like this?
Yeah.

44:39.625 --> 44:41.039
I just want you to know
how special this is for me.

44:46.882 --> 44:47.715
Oh man.

45:17.458 --> 45:18.291
Jackson.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.417
Jackson, that's enough.

45:28.331 --> 45:31.414
Did you see what you needed to see?

45:33.034 --> 45:34.395
Hey.

45:34.396 --> 45:35.777
Hey, Jackson.

45:35.778 --> 45:37.099
Jackson.

45:37.100 --> 45:38.149
Where are you going?

45:38.150 --> 45:40.949
Look, Uncle Jay,
Darth's dead, all right?

45:40.950 --> 45:43.289
Sorry Darth, you're dead.

45:43.290 --> 45:45.669
I know Maeve needs to
answer for what she did.

45:45.670 --> 45:47.359
All right, so I'm gonna go over there

45:47.360 --> 45:48.846
and I'm gonna sit by her
side until the cops show up.

45:48.847 --> 45:49.919
You're gonna go over there,

45:49.920 --> 45:51.669
share a bottle of wine
and wait for the police?

45:51.670 --> 45:52.560
Come on, that's stupid.

45:52.560 --> 45:53.540
Think!

45:53.541 --> 45:56.139
That bitch thinks she's
a vampire, Jackson.

45:56.140 --> 45:57.199
Fine, okay.

45:57.200 --> 45:58.429
At least I look for
the goodness in people.

45:58.430 --> 46:00.359
I don't push them away
when they get too close.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.049
No, you stalk them and you force them

46:02.050 --> 46:03.749
to be your friends, Jackson.

46:03.750 --> 46:04.969
Okay?
Maybe I love her.

46:04.970 --> 46:06.339
Did you ever think about that?

46:06.340 --> 46:08.023
Family, friends.

46:08.900 --> 46:11.519
Jackson, if you walk out that door,

46:11.520 --> 46:13.629
we are not family anymore.

46:13.630 --> 46:14.463
You understand?

46:16.720 --> 46:17.553
Bye, Jay.

46:37.160 --> 46:40.159
Don't ever leave without
telling me, do you understand?

46:40.160 --> 46:40.993
Whatever.

46:40.994 --> 46:43.229
No, not whatever.

46:43.230 --> 46:44.589
We're family.

46:44.590 --> 46:46.949
You don't ever leave family behind.

46:46.950 --> 46:48.180
What family, Dad?

46:54.325 --> 46:56.646
Dad, it's okay, it's okay.

46:56.647 --> 46:57.480
Dad.

47:02.931 --> 47:04.519
Dad!

47:04.520 --> 47:05.353
Jay.

47:06.370 --> 47:07.203
Hello?

47:07.203 --> 47:08.113
Do you see that?

47:11.220 --> 47:12.053
No.

47:13.920 --> 47:16.523
Okay, I'm gonna stop taking sleep mix.

47:17.760 --> 47:19.660
It's really starting to sink in man.

47:21.230 --> 47:22.063
I'm dead.

47:24.270 --> 47:25.920
Never gonna be able to eat again.

47:26.890 --> 47:28.143
That's fucked up.

47:29.970 --> 47:30.903
Gonna miss sushi.

47:34.470 --> 47:36.020
Should've never lied to my mom.

47:37.280 --> 47:38.759
Told her I was working at the blood-bank,

47:38.760 --> 47:41.293
but I was just a delivery guy.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.739
It's really hard to
keep up a lie like that

47:44.740 --> 47:46.939
when you live with your parents, you know?

47:46.940 --> 47:47.773
Stupid.

47:49.950 --> 47:52.100
If I can go back and
just change one thing,

47:54.071 --> 47:55.821
I think I woulda been a better son.

48:01.350 --> 48:02.450
How long do we have?

48:04.610 --> 48:05.443
An hour.

48:07.470 --> 48:09.810
Okay, I have an idea.

48:16.849 --> 48:18.528
I'm dead.

48:18.529 --> 48:23.392
Mm hm, yup.

48:47.070 --> 48:49.750
Jackson.

48:49.751 --> 48:50.584
Jackson.

48:52.220 --> 48:54.670
So we gotta try catching
my voice using an EVP.

48:55.596 --> 48:56.769
What the hell is that?

48:56.770 --> 48:57.969
Electronic voice phenomenon.

48:57.970 --> 48:59.513
Okay, keep scanning the channels.

49:03.490 --> 49:05.067
I've gotta focus my energy.

49:13.400 --> 49:15.800
Ah, this isn't working,
I'm just tensing my hand.

49:31.413 --> 49:32.246
Jackson!

49:33.776 --> 49:34.609
Jackson!

49:36.222 --> 49:37.055
Jackson!

49:40.420 --> 49:41.609
Uncle Jay?

49:41.610 --> 49:44.489
Yes, yes, it's Uncle
Jay, can you hear me?

49:44.490 --> 49:45.929
What?

49:45.930 --> 49:47.609
Hey, Uncle Jay?

49:47.610 --> 49:48.829
What?

49:48.830 --> 49:49.663
Did you call?

49:54.057 --> 49:55.859
Okay, sorry.

49:55.860 --> 49:57.143
All right, listen to me.

49:58.177 --> 50:00.239
It's Jay, it's Jay from the future.

50:00.240 --> 50:02.359
I'm talking to you from tomorrow.

50:02.360 --> 50:03.270
What?

50:03.271 --> 50:05.079
Listen to me, Maeve is
in danger, you're gonna have

50:05.080 --> 50:08.899
to stop a guy named Darth
from entering that house.

50:08.900 --> 50:09.850
Who's Darth?

50:09.851 --> 50:11.969
I'll tell you on the way.

50:11.970 --> 50:13.843
Come on, man, you're
gonna have to trust me.

50:14.750 --> 50:15.583
I'm your uncle!

50:23.295 --> 50:25.719
All right, Uncle Jay,
what's the plan, what do I do?

50:25.720 --> 50:27.159
When you get there, you're gonna wait

50:27.160 --> 50:27.993
for a guy to show up.

50:27.994 --> 50:30.199
He's got curly hair, skeleton shirt.

50:30.200 --> 50:31.719
You'll know him when you see him.

50:31.720 --> 50:32.630
Is he armed?

50:32.631 --> 50:33.838
No.

50:33.839 --> 50:35.759
Is he trying to hurt Maeve?

50:35.760 --> 50:37.979
Yes, yes!

50:37.980 --> 50:39.139
Yes he is.

50:39.140 --> 50:41.819
Change of plans Fer, we're
gonna be making a pick up.

50:41.820 --> 50:42.807
Okay.

50:54.857 --> 50:56.207
What?

51:01.342 --> 51:02.879
Where do we go from here Uncle Jay?

51:02.880 --> 51:04.369
Stop squatting on the street

51:04.370 --> 51:06.089
and hide behind those bushes.

51:06.090 --> 51:06.923
Copy that.

51:13.128 --> 51:14.607
All right.

51:14.608 --> 51:16.848
What do you want me to do, Uncle Jay, huh?

51:16.849 --> 51:18.909
You mean like tough talking?

51:18.910 --> 51:20.409
Give some intimidation eyes.

51:20.410 --> 51:21.849
No, there's no time for that.

51:21.850 --> 51:24.913
All right, we gotta use brute
force and get into Fer's car.

51:25.998 --> 51:28.359
Okay, I don't know, something
sounds wrong about that.

51:28.360 --> 51:29.989
I mean, what if I get him down

51:29.990 --> 51:31.499
and he like kills me or something.

51:31.500 --> 51:34.306
He's not gonna okay, you
gotta trust me on this one.

51:34.307 --> 51:35.140
All right.
Here he comes.

51:35.141 --> 51:37.433
All right, get him to Fer's car.

51:49.310 --> 51:50.164
Hey man, nice costume.

51:50.165 --> 51:52.268
What the hell?

51:52.269 --> 51:53.102
Get off me.

51:53.102 --> 51:54.063
What the?
There ya are, Darth.

51:54.063 --> 51:54.896
Is this some kind of joke?

51:54.897 --> 51:56.009
Come on, just stop resisting.

51:56.010 --> 51:57.214
I just bought this shirt.

51:57.215 --> 51:58.048
Who cares, stop resisting.

51:58.048 --> 51:58.881
Come on, man.

51:58.881 --> 51:59.714
Come on.

52:00.740 --> 52:01.756
Whoa, it's a full moon tonight.

52:01.757 --> 52:03.696
Aw man, your cape smells.

52:03.697 --> 52:05.079
I didn't get to wash it, I'm sorry.

52:05.914 --> 52:07.748
Get off me, man, here.

52:07.749 --> 52:09.121
What the fuck did I do?
Jackson, Jackson.

52:09.122 --> 52:10.588
I just tried to do it.
What are you doing?

52:10.589 --> 52:11.431
Help me get him in the trunk.

52:11.431 --> 52:12.370
No, I want nothing to do with this.

52:12.371 --> 52:13.779
Come on, I'll pay you.

52:13.780 --> 52:15.039
I will pay you.

52:15.040 --> 52:16.765
Come on.
Come on, man.

52:16.766 --> 52:18.527
I need you to stop struggling.

52:18.528 --> 52:19.361
I don't have any money.

52:21.040 --> 52:23.239
Oh, oh, my God.

52:23.240 --> 52:24.073
Wow.

52:25.100 --> 52:26.389
Oh, awesome.

52:26.390 --> 52:27.273
Come on, come on.

52:28.619 --> 52:29.452
What was that?

52:29.452 --> 52:30.285
Orthodox?

52:30.286 --> 52:31.770
Southpaw.
Oh, sweet.

52:36.062 --> 52:37.629
What the fuck is going on?

52:37.630 --> 52:38.630
I don't know.

52:38.631 --> 52:39.789
You don't know?

52:39.790 --> 52:40.623
Let me think.

52:41.570 --> 52:42.869
What do we do now, Uncle Jay?

52:42.870 --> 52:43.737
Get him back to the apartment,

52:43.738 --> 52:46.289
and don't let him go until tomorrow night.

52:46.290 --> 52:47.799
Come on, go.

52:47.800 --> 52:49.671
We're going back to Uncle
Jay's, Fer, step on it.

53:14.060 --> 53:15.359
Darth?

53:15.360 --> 53:18.354
Oh, you sleep through
anything, don't you dickhead?

53:18.355 --> 53:19.320
It worked.

53:19.320 --> 53:20.267
Could you untie me?

53:20.268 --> 53:21.793
All right, this is kidnapping.

53:24.420 --> 53:25.253
Can you feel that?

53:25.253 --> 53:26.250
Stop, yeah I feel it.

53:26.251 --> 53:28.769
Wow, you don't remember anything do you?

53:28.770 --> 53:29.949
Yeah, I remember everything all right?

53:29.950 --> 53:31.186
And I'm gonna sue you.

53:31.187 --> 53:33.859
I'm gonna sue you so hard
when I get outa here.

53:33.860 --> 53:36.249
So you don't remember being a ghost?

53:36.250 --> 53:37.699
'Cause you were, you know.

53:37.700 --> 53:40.579
Oh, okay buddy.

53:40.580 --> 53:44.509
Listen, maybe we could just
order you some court ordered

53:44.510 --> 53:46.089
psychotherapy or something, you know?

53:46.090 --> 53:47.743
Who tied you up, man?

53:49.090 --> 53:51.739
Listen to me, do not go to Maeve's okay?

53:51.740 --> 53:53.129
She's gonna kill you.

53:53.130 --> 53:54.839
All right, she's done it before.

53:54.840 --> 53:56.069
Where's Jackson?

53:56.070 --> 53:57.829
Blue hair took him over to Maeve's.

53:57.830 --> 53:59.799
He's convinced I was gonna
kill her or something.

53:59.800 --> 54:01.969
Oh, yeah, don't worry about
that, I told him you would.

54:01.970 --> 54:03.235
What?
Yeah.

54:16.420 --> 54:17.969
Jackson.

54:17.970 --> 54:18.970
Hey, Uncle Jay.

54:18.970 --> 54:19.860
What do you see?

54:19.860 --> 54:20.780
Oh, it's just Jackson.

54:20.781 --> 54:23.609
What, okay man.

54:23.610 --> 54:25.209
You're crazy, all right.

54:25.210 --> 54:26.533
You're crazy.

54:28.600 --> 54:29.900
What was that all about?

54:35.750 --> 54:36.850
I'm dead, Uncle Jay.

54:39.137 --> 54:43.779
Yeah, I went back to
Maeve's and I told her about

54:43.780 --> 54:46.903
what we did, why Darth never showed up.

54:48.467 --> 54:50.213
She didn't take too kindly to that.

54:51.580 --> 54:52.583
She was hungry, Jay.

54:53.810 --> 54:54.810
She had hungry eyes.

54:55.949 --> 54:59.283
She pulled me in for a hug
and that turned into kissing,

55:00.480 --> 55:01.980
and that turned into stabbing.

55:03.250 --> 55:06.379
Oh, you guys had sex?

55:06.380 --> 55:09.096
No, she just started stabbing.

55:13.779 --> 55:17.279
As I laid there bleeding out on the floor,

55:19.225 --> 55:21.720
she started suckin' the
blood out of my stomach.

55:23.970 --> 55:26.059
I thought you said Darth was
goin' over there to kill her?

55:26.060 --> 55:26.893
I didn't know you were gonna go

55:26.894 --> 55:28.313
straight back to her, Jackson.

55:30.190 --> 55:31.253
This is all my fault.

55:33.530 --> 55:35.429
No, everything that's happened

55:35.430 --> 55:38.030
is because I'm too blind
to see how far gone she is.

55:39.120 --> 55:40.759
Don't worry, Uncle Jay,

55:40.760 --> 55:43.219
I'm not gonna haunt you
here like I did in life.

55:43.220 --> 55:44.053
Jackson.

55:45.800 --> 55:47.250
You'll always be my family.

55:51.970 --> 55:54.519
It's 11:30, I got 30 minutes
left, Jackson, come on.

55:54.520 --> 55:55.679
Well, I figured if you saved

55:55.680 --> 55:57.549
the other guy, you can save me too.

55:57.550 --> 55:59.939
Okay, what time were you stabbed?

55:59.940 --> 56:02.949
Uh, I really wasn't looking at the time.

56:02.950 --> 56:04.199
Come on man, think.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.350
I gotta go back to
before you were stabbed.

56:16.080 --> 56:17.589
It was 11:01 p.m..

56:17.590 --> 56:18.999
All right.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.893
Don't forget your sleep mix, Uncle Jay.

56:30.685 --> 56:34.269
I'm gonna save you, Jackson, I promise.

56:34.270 --> 56:35.164
I believe in you, Uncle Jay.

56:55.805 --> 56:57.959
You don't have to wait up for me, Fer.

56:57.960 --> 56:59.160
Appreciate all the help.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.653
Look, unless I get another
fare, I'm staying right here.

57:15.216 --> 57:17.300
All right, I got it.

57:17.301 --> 57:18.323
20 minutes?

57:21.430 --> 57:23.099
Well that's it
for me Radio mites,

57:23.100 --> 57:26.939
it's your host Miguel
saying what's the point?

57:26.940 --> 57:29.139
This job will never play
for my student loan.

57:29.140 --> 57:29.973
I quit.

57:29.974 --> 57:33.750
You hear that Roger, I quit, I quit this.

57:34.917 --> 57:35.889
No shit.

57:35.890 --> 57:38.089
You're listening
to WAC the shit.

57:39.753 --> 57:41.336
Come on, come on.

57:47.321 --> 57:49.321
Fer, Fer, Fer, it's Jay.

57:54.918 --> 57:55.751
Shit!

57:57.480 --> 57:59.459
Come on, Maeve, you're
taking this vampire

57:59.460 --> 58:00.909
thing to a really unhealthy level.

58:00.910 --> 58:02.079
Give me that.

58:02.080 --> 58:05.229
Stop snooping through my things,
get the fuck outa my face.

58:05.230 --> 58:06.339
Spill the beans, Maeve,

58:06.340 --> 58:08.279
what are you doing with all this blood?

58:08.280 --> 58:09.463
I'm drinking it.

58:10.690 --> 58:12.729
Yeah, people drink blood, Jackson.

58:12.730 --> 58:14.830
Throughout history, it's not that unusual.

58:16.330 --> 58:19.374
There's lots of applications.

58:19.375 --> 58:23.178
Oh, Maeve.

58:23.179 --> 58:24.012
Oh, Maeve.

58:45.227 --> 58:47.173
Fer, Jackson's in trouble.

58:48.360 --> 58:50.030
You need to help him.

58:53.477 --> 58:55.394
I need you to help him.

59:17.701 --> 59:18.868
What the hell?

59:35.850 --> 59:38.819
I can go outside for long
periods of time now, Jackson.

59:38.820 --> 59:40.609
Every night I smear it on and the next day

59:40.610 --> 59:42.739
I can walk around without getting rashes.

59:42.740 --> 59:43.640
That's huge.

59:43.641 --> 59:44.949
Do you know how huge that is for me?

59:44.950 --> 59:46.683
This is about rashes?

59:47.640 --> 59:50.899
No, it's about vitality,
it's about my health.

59:50.900 --> 59:53.319
No, no you don't need blood, Maeve.

59:53.320 --> 59:55.993
Yes I do, and so did my mom.

59:56.930 --> 59:58.369
If she had access to clean blood

59:58.370 --> 01:00:01.246
it would've prolonged
her life, I just know it.

01:00:01.247 --> 01:00:02.397
No, it wouldn't have.

01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:07.087
And what would she think of
what you're doing right now?

01:00:37.953 --> 01:00:38.786
Andy!

01:00:40.433 --> 01:00:41.266
Andy!

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.849
Yeah?

01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:45.489
Andy, help me, I can't move man.

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:47.220
I think it's that damn sleep mix.

01:00:47.221 --> 01:00:49.663
Oh, my God, you're
still taking that stuff?

01:00:49.664 --> 01:00:50.497
Yeah.

01:00:50.498 --> 01:00:53.709
Well, it expired in
2007, didn't you know that?

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:55.289
No, I didn't.

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:56.123
Help me.

01:00:56.124 --> 01:00:57.753
Okay, okay, all right, hold on.

01:00:58.667 --> 01:00:59.787
Don't move.

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:02.373
Are you there?

01:01:02.374 --> 01:01:03.389
Yeah, I'm still here.

01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:04.223
Come on then.

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:08.778
Sometimes you just need
to shake the mortal coil.

01:01:09.987 --> 01:01:11.520
I need help, Jackson.

01:01:13.328 --> 01:01:14.245
I need you.

01:01:22.238 --> 01:01:23.288
Stop where you are.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.253
Drop the knife, now.

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.330
Do I know you from somewhere?

01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:32.499
I don't, I don't think so.

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.813
Bitch, drop the knife, now.

01:01:37.838 --> 01:01:40.727
Don't cross this line.

01:01:40.728 --> 01:01:42.561
Don't cross this line.

01:01:43.438 --> 01:01:44.296
Maeve, I got the blood.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.553
Crazy bitch.

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:55.132
Meave, what are you doing?

01:01:55.133 --> 01:01:56.412
Why are you stabbing people?

01:01:56.413 --> 01:01:57.655
Jackson, duck.

01:01:59.978 --> 01:02:01.434
Holy shit.

01:02:01.435 --> 01:02:03.352
Should I pull it out?

01:02:04.315 --> 01:02:05.148
Oh, ah.

01:02:13.766 --> 01:02:15.099
Dude, stop it.

01:02:17.658 --> 01:02:18.491
Jackson.

01:02:20.108 --> 01:02:20.941
Jackson.

01:02:24.194 --> 01:02:25.027
Look, I don't know what to tell you.

01:02:25.028 --> 01:02:26.929
I have never seen this before.

01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:29.189
I never get couch lock.

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:31.293
Except when I take sleep mix.

01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:36.124
Have you tried yoga?

01:02:36.125 --> 01:02:36.958
What?

01:02:38.297 --> 01:02:39.297
Okay, that's good.

01:02:40.168 --> 01:02:41.585
There, you comfy?

Jackson.

01:03:01.185 --> 01:03:02.018
Jackson

01:03:07.581 --> 01:03:09.664
You earned this, Maeve.

01:03:26.685 --> 01:03:28.102
Way to go, champ.

01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:33.565
Are you okay?

01:03:35.296 --> 01:03:37.697
Ow, my foot.
Sorry, sorry.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:44.133
You want me to take it out?

01:03:45.538 --> 01:03:47.399
I was thinking maybe
I'd just leave it in.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.809
Ow, fuck.

01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:50.639
Sorry, put pressure on it.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:51.690
We gotta go, come on.

01:03:52.821 --> 01:03:53.654
Get in.

01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:56.969
You're on my property, Jackson.

01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:58.549
You and your little friend assaulted me.

01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:00.200
You're gonna go to jail for this.

01:04:01.969 --> 01:04:04.303
You know I can't make you
do the right thing, Maeve.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:10.300
But, I can point you
in the right direction.

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:16.543
What?

01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:19.969
What did you?

01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:21.069
Are you freakin' serious?

01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:22.283
Who did you call?

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.273
Jackson.

01:04:25.367 --> 01:04:26.200
Jackson!

01:04:37.331 --> 01:04:38.914
Just, be careful.

Let him sleep.

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:11.462
I think I need to go to the hospital.

01:05:11.463 --> 01:05:14.796
We're gonna get you checked out buddy.

01:06:03.258 --> 01:06:04.091
Ah!

01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:06.969
Breakfast time.

01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:08.270
What is it with you man?

01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:15.169
You want coffee?

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:16.479
Uh, yeah.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.859
Nice.

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:18.963
There ya go.

01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:23.401
No, no, that's okay.

01:06:23.402 --> 01:06:25.364
<i>♪ Every morning I wake up ♪</i>

01:06:25.365 --> 01:06:26.198
Thank you.

01:06:26.198 --> 01:06:27.070
Whatever you say, my friend.

01:06:27.071 --> 01:06:29.903
All right, that's, that is plenty.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.263
Hey, uh, Jay.

01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:36.729
I'm still kinda fuzzy how everything

01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:40.273
went down last night, but thanks.

01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:45.019
I'm alive, just kidding.

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:48.639
Hey man, I'm glad you're here.

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.189
Okay, thank you.
Yeah.

01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:51.023
Thanks, Jay.

01:06:52.132 --> 01:06:52.965
Thank you.

01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:03.720
What are you doin' in my bed?

01:07:04.790 --> 01:07:06.469
Fine, I'll leave.

01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:09.793
No, no, I was, it's fine,
I just wanted to know what.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.040
You want a donut?

01:07:13.890 --> 01:07:14.723
Sure.

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:18.029
I'm gonna get you a donut.

01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:18.863
Jay.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Um, do you remember anything
weird about last night?

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:34.340
Um...

01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:39.363
No, I was pretty sauced last night.

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:41.759
Yeah.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.153
Okay, good night.

01:07:55.174 --> 01:07:57.591
Would you stop shocking me?

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:27.252
Jackson.

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.020
Hey, Uncle Jay.

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.590
Pretty wild night last night.

01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:43.800
What happened with Maeve?

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.819
She's gonna be in timeout a while.

01:08:48.029 --> 01:08:49.867
A long while, so.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.948
Hey, Jackson.

01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:53.783
Yeah?

01:09:00.029 --> 01:09:00.903
Thanks.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:03.993
Yeah.

01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:07.420
I already have that one anyway, so.

01:09:16.129 --> 01:09:17.379
Uh huh, yeah.

01:09:19.983 --> 01:09:21.419
There you go.

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.505
What's this?

01:09:22.506 --> 01:09:23.589
Open it up.

01:09:29.523 --> 01:09:30.356
Huh.

01:09:30.357 --> 01:09:32.019
That's the second to last box of Mandao's

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:33.693
while your dad was head honcho.

01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:36.700
Paid a pretty penny for that.

01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:39.788
Thank you, Jackson.

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:41.529
Yeah, of course.

01:09:41.529 --> 01:09:43.049
How'd you get this?

01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:45.506
Ah, I was a victim
of the one click trick,

01:09:45.508 --> 01:09:46.858
but I'm gonna pay you back.

01:09:48.368 --> 01:09:49.616
If you're gonna start living here,

01:09:49.617 --> 01:09:52.549
you gotta pull your weight, get a job.

01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:55.669
Oh yeah man, next month,
it's gonna be my month.

01:09:55.670 --> 01:09:57.459
I'm gonna go, you know,
look for some work and...

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:58.579
Today, today.

01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:01.149
And another thing I want
you to wash this tent, okay?

01:10:01.150 --> 01:10:03.039
Oh, sure, yeah, I'll give it

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.549
a deep cleaning, deep scrubbing.

01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:07.244
Yeah, it's dirty as filth.

01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:10.330
I though, I know, I know.

01:11:39.167 --> 01:11:41.417
Jay, you're all grown up.

01:11:43.142 --> 01:11:43.975
Yeah.

01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:47.859
There's something you should know

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:49.999
and I don't have much time.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:50.833
Okay.

01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:55.110
It's really not for me to say, but um,

01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:58.776
you might wanna get out
of town for a while.

01:11:58.777 --> 01:12:03.777
Or not, it's not mandatory,
but really, you should leave.

01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:05.230
Why?
Because, now don't

01:12:05.231 --> 01:12:06.210
astral project anymore, okay?

01:12:06.211 --> 01:12:09.883
Because it's, but if you
want, no, just don't.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:11.853
If...

01:12:11.854 --> 01:12:14.859
Dad, dad, what's going on?

01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:17.060
Word got out about
what you did last night

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.353
and it's creating a
stir on the other side.

01:12:20.354 --> 01:12:22.633
Yeah, yeah, people are excited about it?

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.969
No?

01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:27.923
Do you trust me?

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.113
Yeah.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.599
Yes, I do.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.070
We never leave family behind.

01:12:40.071 --> 01:12:41.031
Come with me.

01:12:41.031 --> 01:12:41.864
Okay.

01:14:07.767 --> 01:14:09.049
Get out!

01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:09.883
Get out!
