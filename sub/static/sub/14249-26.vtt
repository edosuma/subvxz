WEBVTT

00:11.444 --> 00:12.809
Look.

00:15.548 --> 00:18.108
And you said they were
incompatible.

00:19.652 --> 00:22.177
You have confirmed
the genetic structure?

00:22.255 --> 00:25.224
An entirely new species.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.691
l'm going to name it after you.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.922
The Tuvok orchid.

00:31.464 --> 00:34.490
That is an honor you should
reserve for yourself, Mr. Suder.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.035
You gave this species life.

00:37.103 --> 00:38.593
And you gave me life.

00:38.671 --> 00:40.901
All of this is because of you.

00:43.676 --> 00:45.667
Because of the meld.

00:45.745 --> 00:50.182
The meld may have introduced you
to my interest in floriculture,

00:50.250 --> 00:53.344
but you have embraced it
entirely on your own.

00:53.420 --> 00:56.856
And discovered a unique
talent within yourself

00:56.923 --> 00:58.049
in the process.

00:58.124 --> 01:01.651
l used to think
the only talent l had

01:01.728 --> 01:04.697
was a talent for killing.

01:04.763 --> 01:08.962
Please... it's my way
of saying thank you.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.562
Very well.

01:12.639 --> 01:14.334
l accept.

01:19.012 --> 01:22.948
Tuvok, l want to do
something for the ship.

01:23.016 --> 01:25.814
l'm not asking you
to let me out of confinement.

01:25.885 --> 01:27.113
l accept my punishment.

01:27.187 --> 01:29.621
But if l could just...

01:29.689 --> 01:32.351
just contribute somehow.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.859
What contribution do you
feel you could make

01:34.928 --> 01:36.327
from your quarters?

01:36.396 --> 01:40.765
l was... l was thinking
l might adapt

01:40.834 --> 01:43.268
some of the genetic
engineering techniques

01:43.336 --> 01:45.099
l've developed for the orchids

01:45.171 --> 01:48.197
to make the airponic vegetable
garden more productive.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.305
Your attitude is admirable.

01:51.377 --> 01:54.608
l will discuss it
with the Captain.

01:54.681 --> 01:57.047
Do you think she'll agree?

01:58.051 --> 01:59.848
We'll see.

01:59.919 --> 02:01.352
Now, shall we begin?

02:05.391 --> 02:07.586
Notice your mind working.

02:07.660 --> 02:10.389
How it plans for the future,

02:10.463 --> 02:12.658
visits the past.

02:12.732 --> 02:14.495
Notice those thoughts

02:14.567 --> 02:16.660
and set them aside.

02:16.736 --> 02:19.796
Turn your attention
to the white light

02:19.873 --> 02:22.307
that is your breath.

02:22.375 --> 02:25.139
Captain, we're being hailed
on a subspace frequency.

02:25.211 --> 02:26.906
Are there ships in the vicinity?

02:26.980 --> 02:29.141
Negative.
Tracking the source.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.748
Seems likes it's coming
from an unmanned buoy.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.255
Coordinates 140 mark 317.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.983
lt looks like a Kazon signal,
Captain.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.287
Take us out of warp.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.884
Open a channel.

02:43.129 --> 02:46.360
Chakotay, they're going
to take your son.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.161
When Culluh saw the baby...

02:48.234 --> 02:49.792
l hear them coming.

02:49.869 --> 02:50.927
l don't have much time.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.631
When he saw
the baby wasn't his...

02:52.705 --> 02:56.368
Please, Chakotay, help us--
not for me, for your son.

02:56.442 --> 02:58.307
l told you to stay out of here.

02:58.378 --> 02:59.902
No, please don't.

02:59.979 --> 03:01.640
Don't take him!

03:01.748 --> 03:04.717
l beg... No! Please, no.

03:04.751 --> 03:05.775
No!

03:07.000 --> 03:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:00.033 --> 05:01.933
This is not my responsibility.

05:02.001 --> 05:03.468
She has no right to expect me...

05:03.536 --> 05:05.299
She knows you, Chakotay.

05:05.371 --> 05:08.863
She knew how you'd react
when you saw your son in danger.

05:08.941 --> 05:10.806
l have a duty to this crew.

05:10.877 --> 05:13.812
l can't just leave
and go looking for the child.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.404
And l'd never consider
letting you go

05:15.481 --> 05:17.346
into a Kazon-Nistrim
stronghold by yourself.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.942
lf we do this,
we do it together.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.620
That's something else
Seska would know, too.

05:23.690 --> 05:24.918
Do you think it's a trap?

05:25.024 --> 05:26.651
Do l think Seska is capable

05:26.726 --> 05:29.024
of manipulating
you and me with this?

05:29.095 --> 05:31.086
Oh, yes.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.655
On the other hand,
it was time for her to deliver.

05:33.733 --> 05:34.700
And that baby we saw

05:34.767 --> 05:36.792
did look part Cardassian
and part human.

05:36.869 --> 05:39.337
And knowing Culluh,
l'm sure his pride was wounded

05:39.405 --> 05:41.373
when he realized
the child wasn't his.

05:41.441 --> 05:42.931
lt makes sense, Chakotay.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.567
lt might all be true.

05:45.645 --> 05:46.703
Still, the safest thing would be

05:46.779 --> 05:49.373
to ignore this message
and resume our course.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.209
l'm not going to resume
our course just yet.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.811
l want you to think about it,
Chakotay.

05:57.924 --> 06:00.222
This has to be your decision.

06:00.293 --> 06:03.126
lf you choose to go after him,

06:03.196 --> 06:04.788
l know l speak
for the entire crew--

06:04.864 --> 06:06.855
Starfleet and Maquis alike--

06:06.933 --> 06:09.766
when l say
we'll stand behind you.

06:24.617 --> 06:27.108
Ah-koo-chee-moya.

06:27.186 --> 06:31.919
We are far from the sacred
places of our grandfathers.

06:31.991 --> 06:35.290
We are far from the bones
of my people,

06:35.361 --> 06:39.320
but l ask on this day
of sorrow and uncertainty

06:39.399 --> 06:43.927
that the wisdom
of my father find me

06:44.036 --> 06:47.369
and help me understand
my dilemma.

06:47.440 --> 06:51.103
Speak to me, Father.

06:51.177 --> 06:54.476
Speak to me in my dreams.

06:54.547 --> 06:57.846
l've never seen you
so troubled, Chakotay.

07:29.682 --> 07:31.707
l have a son, Father.

07:33.052 --> 07:35.145
A son, Chakotay?

07:36.255 --> 07:38.314
Oh.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.554
This is the reason
for your despair.

07:41.627 --> 07:45.859
Was he born with two arms
and two legs

07:45.932 --> 07:48.230
and a heart that beats?

07:48.301 --> 07:49.393
Yes, but...

07:49.469 --> 07:51.937
Then it's a cause
for celebration.

07:52.038 --> 07:56.805
You will make a fine father.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.605
You needn't worry.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.176
l'm not sure l'm willing
to be a father to him.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.843
Hmm. Not willing?

08:05.952 --> 08:08.944
He was born without my consent.

08:09.021 --> 08:10.386
l had no part in it.

08:12.058 --> 08:14.151
No part in it?

08:14.227 --> 08:17.594
Well, it's been a long time,
so forgive me,

08:17.663 --> 08:21.463
but it seems that l had
to play a part

08:21.534 --> 08:23.525
before your mother
could conceive.

08:23.603 --> 08:26.572
My DNA was taken from me.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.630
Used by a woman
to impregnate herself

08:28.708 --> 08:30.005
without my permission.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.910
l see.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.345
You're trying to decide
whether you should

08:36.414 --> 08:38.405
accept the child
in your heart.

08:38.484 --> 08:40.543
lt's more than that.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.383
But it must begin with that.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.548
How do you take
a child into your heart

08:44.624 --> 08:47.491
who is forced upon you
by a mother's deception?

08:50.897 --> 08:53.024
He knows nothing of deception.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.164
He is innocent.

08:57.737 --> 09:00.433
Centuries ago,
when the women of our tribe

09:00.506 --> 09:04.533
were raped
by white conquerors, many

09:04.610 --> 09:06.805
gave birth to their children.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.814
And we did not reject them.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.851
They were accepted by the tribe.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.483
One was a direct ancestor
of ours, Chakotay.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.994
His name was Ce Acatl.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.861
He became a great leader
of our people.

09:25.932 --> 09:31.962
Here is a man who was given life
without his mother's consent.

09:32.038 --> 09:34.404
Are you so different from her?

09:35.942 --> 09:38.934
And is your child so different
from Ce Acatl?

09:44.116 --> 09:45.447
No.

09:48.554 --> 09:51.352
He is your son, Chakotay.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.521
And he is a child of our people.

10:19.885 --> 10:20.977
l've been in touch

10:21.087 --> 10:24.079
with the Talaxian
mining colony on Prema ll.

10:24.156 --> 10:26.215
They're willing to come
to our assistance

10:26.292 --> 10:27.350
if we run into trouble.

10:27.426 --> 10:31.157
That's good for about 40 hours
if we average warp 2.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.959
After that, we're out
of their com range.

10:33.032 --> 10:35.000
Well, it's nice to know
we have friends in the area.

10:35.067 --> 10:36.125
Thank you, Neelix.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.466
l recommend a full diagnostic
of our tactical array

10:38.537 --> 10:40.095
prior to the start
of the mission, Captain.

10:40.172 --> 10:42.037
Agreed, but l want more
from tactical, Lieutenant.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.938
l want to anticipate a trap.

10:44.010 --> 10:46.604
And l want a few tricks up
our sleeves, if we need them.

10:46.679 --> 10:50.046
Captain, l could program the
deflector grid to make it look

10:50.116 --> 10:51.378
like we have help on the way.

10:51.450 --> 10:52.576
l'll show you what l mean.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.279
Excuse me, Doctor.

10:57.723 --> 10:58.690
Echo displacement.

10:58.758 --> 10:59.986
Exactly.

11:00.092 --> 11:02.424
This is how we'd look
to the enemy sensors.

11:03.929 --> 11:07.387
lf we generate multiple
decoy images like these,

11:07.466 --> 11:10.799
the Kazon would think that
ships are coming toward us.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.269
We could create
as many as we want.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.033
That's a good start, Harry.

11:14.106 --> 11:15.573
lt should distract them
for a while.

11:15.641 --> 11:16.665
But what else can we do

11:16.742 --> 11:19.336
if we're eventually intercepted
by a superior force?

11:19.412 --> 11:21.676
lf you don't mind,
l do have something to add.

11:23.249 --> 11:24.682
Thank you.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.741
Captain, l hesitate
to offer suggestions

11:26.819 --> 11:28.514
in a field of endeavor
that is not

11:28.587 --> 11:30.316
within my usual area
of expertise.

11:30.389 --> 11:31.856
Please, Doctor, your suggestions

11:31.924 --> 11:33.551
on any subject
are always welcome.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.959
Really? ln that case,
you may expect several more

11:37.029 --> 11:38.963
on a variety of matters
in the near future.

11:39.031 --> 11:41.898
Right now, may l suggest
that we also consider

11:41.967 --> 11:45.300
attempting to create
an actual holographic illusion

11:45.371 --> 11:47.271
of friendly ships.

11:47.339 --> 11:48.499
With all due respect, Doctor,

11:48.574 --> 11:51.441
we can't even figure out how
to project you into this room.

11:51.510 --> 11:54.308
How are we supposed to create
holographic ships in space?

11:54.380 --> 11:55.347
l would humbly submit

11:55.414 --> 11:57.314
that my program
is far more sophisticated

11:57.383 --> 11:59.010
than your run-of-the-mill
hologram.

11:59.185 --> 12:01.244
ln fact, projecting the illusion

12:01.320 --> 12:03.413
of a large
three-dimensional object

12:03.489 --> 12:05.684
has been a trick of magicians
for centuries.

12:05.758 --> 12:07.817
We'll just do it with mirrors.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.828
Mr. Paris' predictable attempts
at humor not withstanding,

12:10.896 --> 12:13.296
that is precisely
what l would suggest.

12:13.365 --> 12:17.529
lnstalling holo-emitters along
the hull with parabolic mirrors

12:17.603 --> 12:20.504
to enlarge the images as they
are reflected into space.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.562
We're going to use up

12:21.640 --> 12:24.200
a lot of our power reserves
trying to pull it off.

12:24.276 --> 12:27.643
lf these ships can fool
the Kazon, it's worth it.

12:27.713 --> 12:29.146
But can they?

12:29.215 --> 12:31.683
lf the Kazon
scan the holograms, they will

12:31.751 --> 12:34.447
immediately realize there
are no life signs on board,

12:34.520 --> 12:35.487
no power signatures...

12:35.554 --> 12:37.181
Okay, so we can't
fool them for long,

12:37.256 --> 12:38.655
but maybe it'll be long enough.

12:38.724 --> 12:39.986
lt's an advantage.

12:40.059 --> 12:42.391
And we'll need every advantage
we can get on this mission.

12:42.461 --> 12:43.928
Work on the Doctor with it,
B'Elanna.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.861
Mr. Kim, cut power
to all systems

12:45.931 --> 12:47.364
to minimum requirements.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.491
l don't want to show up

12:48.567 --> 12:50.125
on any Kazon
long-range scanners.

12:50.202 --> 12:53.035
Mr. Paris, locate the warp
signature from Culluh's ship

12:53.105 --> 12:54.595
and set a course to follow--
warp 2.

12:54.673 --> 12:55.640
Aye, Captain.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.800
Dismissed.

12:56.876 --> 12:59.845
Uh, excuse me,
but there is one more thing.

13:01.413 --> 13:02.880
Thank you.

13:17.496 --> 13:18.827
lt's not Culluh's ship.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.263
Looks more like a shuttle.

13:20.332 --> 13:21.264
Slow to impulse.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.891
Set an intercept course,
Mr. Paris.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.528
Have they indicated
the nature of the distress?

13:25.604 --> 13:27.196
Just a signal, Captain.
No response to our hails.

13:27.273 --> 13:28.433
Let's go to Red Alert.

13:29.608 --> 13:30.575
Visual range.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.735
On screen.

13:33.345 --> 13:36.109
Showing one life sign.
Adult Kazon male.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.342
He's in critical condition.

13:37.416 --> 13:38.348
Janeway to Sick Bay.

13:38.417 --> 13:40.351
Prepare to receive
an emergency transport.

13:40.419 --> 13:41.408
Standing by, Captain.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.419
Commander.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.819
Mr. Tuvok, you have the Bridge.

13:43.889 --> 13:44.821
Remain at Red Alert.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.050
Aye, Captain.

13:49.395 --> 13:50.487
His hip is broken.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.929
Showing severe inflammation
in the bronchial tissue.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.556
lt appears he inhaled
noxious gases

13:54.633 --> 13:56.157
vented in the damaged shuttle.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.827
40 milligrams pulmozine.

13:57.903 --> 13:58.961
l know this man.

13:59.038 --> 14:00.403
His name's Tierna.

14:00.472 --> 14:02.064
He's one of Seska's aides.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.075
She had him work me over
when l was on their ship.

14:05.411 --> 14:09.211
Seska... is dead.

14:21.126 --> 14:23.617
Seska thought that she
could manipulate the maje.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.324
She bragged about it to me
more than once,

14:26.398 --> 14:28.229
but this time she was wrong.

14:28.300 --> 14:32.532
We had just launched the buoy
with the message for you.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.073
Then they came for her.

14:35.140 --> 14:40.407
They cut her throat,
as Culluh watched.

14:40.479 --> 14:45.348
He ordered them to execute me,
but l bribed one of the guards

14:45.417 --> 14:47.078
to get me to a shuttle.

14:47.152 --> 14:50.451
As soon as he saw it leaving,
Culluh opened fire--

14:50.522 --> 14:53.719
destroyed
my life-support systems.

14:53.792 --> 14:56.625
He left me in space to die.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.253
What about the child?

14:58.330 --> 15:03.825
Taken to the Gema lV colony
to be raised as a servant.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.872
We'll be needing your help
getting to the Gema system.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.997
You're going after him?

15:09.074 --> 15:11.599
This ship, alone?

15:11.677 --> 15:14.646
l want nothing to do with this.

15:14.713 --> 15:17.477
l'm not taking you
into Nistrim space.

15:18.984 --> 15:22.010
Under the circumstances, l'd say
you don't have much of a choice.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.188
What's his prognosis?

15:28.260 --> 15:31.195
He'll be on his feet
in a day or two,

15:31.263 --> 15:32.696
but there's still
a number of things

15:32.765 --> 15:33.823
we need to keep an eye on.

15:33.899 --> 15:39.337
He's had... a nasty concussion,
spinal cord trauma

15:39.405 --> 15:43.739
and a polycythemia, the cause
of which l've yet to discover.

15:43.809 --> 15:45.276
Polycythemia?

15:45.344 --> 15:48.802
An abnormal increase in the
number of red blood cells.

15:50.316 --> 15:52.580
l'd like you to run
an autonomic response analysis

15:52.651 --> 15:53.982
the next time l question him.

15:54.053 --> 15:56.112
l'm afraid
that won't help you determine

15:56.188 --> 15:57.416
if he's telling the truth,
Commander.

15:57.489 --> 16:00.515
An ARA depends on making
a baseline comparison

16:00.592 --> 16:03.493
with a known response
for a given species.

16:03.562 --> 16:04.551
Any Tom, Dick or Harry

16:04.630 --> 16:06.723
from the Alpha Quadrant,
l could probably help you,

16:06.799 --> 16:09.597
but not with any of the new
species of the Delta Quadrant.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.672
Regarding his veracity,
it may help you to know

16:15.741 --> 16:17.333
that if we'd arrived
an hour later,

16:17.409 --> 16:20.037
he would have been dead
from his injuries.

16:24.183 --> 16:26.344
The molecular variance residual
on his shuttle

16:26.418 --> 16:29.387
is evidence of disruptor blasts,
and the signature is Kazon,

16:29.455 --> 16:32.288
so at least that part of
his story seems to be true.

16:32.358 --> 16:34.758
Plus, we confirmed
nitrogen tetroxide fumes

16:34.827 --> 16:35.851
were in the cabin.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.828
lf all this was part
of a Kazon scheme,

16:37.896 --> 16:39.625
he had to be willing
to breathe poison

16:39.698 --> 16:41.063
for hours before we got there.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.498
Have you found anything at all

16:42.568 --> 16:44.195
that would cast
doubt on his story?

16:46.305 --> 16:47.897
No.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.439
l still don't trust him.

16:56.115 --> 16:58.140
The trip would take six days
at warp 2.

16:58.217 --> 17:01.812
Four days, if you didn't take
such a circuitous route--

17:01.887 --> 17:03.855
if we simply went
across the Tenarus cluster.

17:03.922 --> 17:05.013
You would encounter

17:05.089 --> 17:08.685
the Nistrim fleet
before a single day passed.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.490
Anyone who knows
this part of space

17:10.561 --> 17:12.086
will tell you the same thing.

17:12.164 --> 17:14.826
lt so happens that l do know

17:14.900 --> 17:17.630
this part of space,
my Kazon friend.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.194
l just wanted to see if you
would tell us the truth.

17:20.271 --> 17:23.298
The route he suggests
is safer, Captain.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.705
Of course it's safer.

17:24.777 --> 17:28.178
l don't want to run into Culluh
any more than you do.

17:28.247 --> 17:30.772
We might have more
success avoiding him

17:30.849 --> 17:33.977
if you gave us the command codes
for the Nistrim defense net.

17:36.088 --> 17:39.819
Computer, display tactical
overview of our current course.

17:43.896 --> 17:51.166
Enter code sequence: Four-nine-
one-one-seven-zero-Culluh.

17:58.343 --> 18:01.835
Mr. Paris, adjust our course
to avoid the defense net.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.211
Aye, Captain.

18:03.282 --> 18:06.376
That is not an end
to the danger.

18:06.452 --> 18:09.512
We are heading
into an area of space

18:09.588 --> 18:13.854
populated by Kazon factions
that are loyal to no one.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.726
They will attack
without provocation.

18:25.204 --> 18:29.607
Vessel approaching.
Coordinates: 314 mark 21.

18:29.675 --> 18:31.165
Signature is Kazon.

18:31.243 --> 18:32.301
Red Alert.

18:32.377 --> 18:34.868
Configuration
of the ship, Mr. Tuvok?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.380
A small raider, Captain.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.040
lt does not pose
a significant threat.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.484
Nevertheless, it is powering up
its weapon systems.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.347
Shields are holding.

18:45.791 --> 18:46.883
Return fire.

18:53.198 --> 18:54.495
The raider is breaking
off its attack.

18:54.566 --> 18:55.658
Minor damage

18:55.734 --> 18:58.862
to secondary command
processors on Deck 12.

18:58.937 --> 19:00.063
EPS power supplies,

19:00.172 --> 19:02.697
and isolinear controllers
are off-line.

19:02.741 --> 19:03.708
No casualties though.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.606
Begin repairs, Mr. Kim.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.838
Any other sign of Kazon ships,
Lieutenant?

19:07.946 --> 19:09.243
Nothing on long-range sensors.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.838
The raider is
continuing to retreat.

19:10.949 --> 19:14.248
We should have a couple of hours
to ourselves at least.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.411
Good. We can use them.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.784
Stand down Red Alert.

19:16.855 --> 19:18.379
Captain, we're about to go

19:18.457 --> 19:21.483
beyond the com range
of the Talaxian colony.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.084
Just thought you'd like to know.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.993
Thank you, Lieutenant.

19:25.063 --> 19:26.325
Maintain current course.

19:26.398 --> 19:27.365
Captain.

19:29.635 --> 19:31.466
l haven't forgotten, Mr. Tuvok.

19:31.537 --> 19:32.469
Very well.

19:32.538 --> 19:33.903
This seems
as good a time as any.

19:45.317 --> 19:46.284
Captain.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.283
Mr. Suder.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.479
Please... please come in.

19:49.555 --> 19:50.920
W-won't you sit down?

19:50.989 --> 19:52.684
Excuse the mess.

19:52.758 --> 19:55.727
l wasn't expecting company.

19:55.794 --> 19:58.558
Can l get you some tea?

19:58.630 --> 20:00.097
Have you had lunch?

20:00.165 --> 20:01.655
Nothing, thank you.

20:01.733 --> 20:04.600
Lieutenant Tuvok has been
telling me about your progress.

20:04.670 --> 20:08.071
Has he? Well, l'm...

20:08.140 --> 20:10.665
l'm very grateful to him,
Captain.

20:10.742 --> 20:12.334
l still have a lot
to learn, of course,

20:12.411 --> 20:13.935
but he is an excellent tutor.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.105
When we first started
our studies, l...

20:16.181 --> 20:18.877
The Captain's time
is limited, Mr. Suder.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.509
What?

20:20.586 --> 20:22.281
Oh.

20:22.354 --> 20:23.480
Of course.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.648
l have explained
your proposal to her.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.589
l'd like to know
more about it, Mr. Suder.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.092
What exactly would be involved?

20:29.161 --> 20:31.493
Yes, yes...

20:31.563 --> 20:33.121
Let me show you.

20:33.198 --> 20:36.827
l've actually had
very encouraging results

20:36.902 --> 20:39.336
with a new
gene-splicing technique.

20:39.404 --> 20:42.601
l created a targeted
restriction enzyme

20:42.674 --> 20:44.335
to facilitate the hybrid.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.967
And you feel
you could experiment

20:46.044 --> 20:48.808
on our airponic crops
here in your quarters?

20:48.880 --> 20:52.976
Absolutely. l would make
this an airponic laboratory

20:53.051 --> 20:55.781
and all l would need
are a few plants,

20:55.854 --> 20:57.048
certain chemicals and equipment.

20:57.122 --> 20:58.521
What sort of chemicals
and equipment?

20:58.590 --> 20:59.955
Nothing dangerous.

21:00.025 --> 21:02.289
l've prepared a list.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.737
lt's an interesting
proposition, Mr. Suder.

21:12.804 --> 21:14.795
Let me discuss it with Kes
and Lieutenant Tuvok

21:14.873 --> 21:15.931
and l'll get back to you.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.599
l've already discussed
it with Kes

21:17.676 --> 21:20.736
and she is very interested.

21:20.812 --> 21:22.575
Good. Let me give it
some thought.

21:22.648 --> 21:24.775
lf you're worried
you can't trust me, Captain...

21:24.850 --> 21:25.908
Mr. Tuvok has assured...

21:25.984 --> 21:30.284
l only want to do something--
something for the ship.

21:30.355 --> 21:32.516
l understand, Mr. Suder.

21:32.591 --> 21:33.751
Then what's the problem?

21:33.825 --> 21:35.452
Why won't you give me an answer?

21:35.527 --> 21:36.687
Mr. Suder.

21:43.468 --> 21:46.562
l just want to do
something for the ship.

21:49.274 --> 21:50.605
Excuse me.

22:06.958 --> 22:09.017
Captain's Log, supplemental.

22:09.094 --> 22:12.359
None of the four Kazon attacks
have caused serious damage,

22:12.431 --> 22:14.899
but the starboard ventral
has been hit each time--

22:14.966 --> 22:18.197
complicating repairs on the
secondary command processors.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.932
You are making an adequate
recovery, Mr. Tierna.

22:25.077 --> 22:27.102
The only matter
that l simply cannot understand

22:27.179 --> 22:28.806
is this lingering polycythemia.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.245
l feel fine.

22:30.315 --> 22:31.407
The medical record you gave us

22:31.483 --> 22:34.111
does not indicate any prior
blood disorders.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.949
Might it be an inherited trait?

22:36.021 --> 22:37.386
Do you know
if your parents ever..?

22:37.456 --> 22:40.550
My parents were killed
in a Trabe attack

22:40.625 --> 22:42.786
shortly after l was born.

22:44.296 --> 22:45.627
l see.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.530
Well, we'll need to monitor
this condition for a while.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.693
lt might be due to some
chemical imbalance

22:50.769 --> 22:52.236
that our sensors
aren't recognizing.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.204
Possibly the result

22:54.272 --> 22:56.638
of the toxins you inhaled
while on the shuttle.

22:59.077 --> 23:00.135
You're welcome.

23:05.984 --> 23:07.212
Feeling better?

23:07.285 --> 23:10.152
l'm sure l'll make
a complete recovery.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.520
Just in time for the Gema
colony's defense force

23:12.591 --> 23:14.320
to destroy us all.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.918
You're still not optimistic
about our chances, are you?

23:16.995 --> 23:18.053
No.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.325
We've had no problem
repelling the attacks so far.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.391
Attacks... when there's
a real Nistrim attack,

23:23.468 --> 23:24.765
you'll know it.

23:24.836 --> 23:27.771
You still have pride in the
Nistrim, don't you, Tierna?

23:27.839 --> 23:29.329
Even after what they did to you.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.933
l remember that pride
in your eyes when you

23:32.010 --> 23:34.877
pounded me with your fists
while l was tied to a chair.

23:34.946 --> 23:37.608
And l can see it
in your eyes now,

23:37.682 --> 23:40.981
and that scares
the hell out of me.

23:41.052 --> 23:44.579
You must scare easily,
Federation.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.189
Tell me something, Tierna.

23:49.261 --> 23:52.230
Every Kazon attack seems to
focus on our starboard ventral.

23:52.297 --> 23:53.992
Think that might be
some kind of pattern?

23:54.065 --> 23:55.327
l wouldn't know.

23:55.400 --> 23:58.130
Because if it is,
and you've been lying to us...

23:58.203 --> 23:59.795
Commander Chakotay.

23:59.871 --> 24:02.601
Not in my Sick Bay, please.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.709
Firing phasers.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.083
lncrease speed
to one-half impulse.

24:16.154 --> 24:17.086
Aye, Captain.

24:17.155 --> 24:19.487
They're coming
at our starboard ventral again.

24:19.558 --> 24:21.048
Our shields there
haven't been repaired yet.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.286
We're going to sustain
more damage

24:22.360 --> 24:23.657
to the secondary
command processors.

24:23.728 --> 24:25.059
Starboard ventral.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.098
Warning.
Fires have been detected

24:27.165 --> 24:31.397
on Decks 12 and 15
Sections A-4 through C-18.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.903
Control units are responding,
Captain.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.735
Keep our port forequarter facing
the line of attack, Mr. Paris.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.274
Don't let them see
our starboard ventral.

24:37.342 --> 24:38.366
l'm doing my best.

24:38.443 --> 24:40.411
Continuous fire,
starboard phasers.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.242
Acknowledged.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.576
They're withdrawing, Captain.

24:43.648 --> 24:44.808
Stand down Red Alert.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.209
Mr. Kim?

24:48.286 --> 24:50.379
Deck 12 is in shambles.

24:50.455 --> 24:51.786
We barely have time
to begin repairs

24:51.857 --> 24:53.085
before they attack it again.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.716
At least no one was hurt.

24:54.793 --> 24:57.387
The secondary command processors
are nonfunctional.

24:57.462 --> 24:58.793
We'll have to rebuild them.

24:58.864 --> 25:00.388
l'd say we're looking
at two days' work

25:00.499 --> 25:02.160
if we're not attacked again.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.191
Why would these factions
of Kazon, loyal to no one,

25:04.269 --> 25:05.793
all have the same agenda?

25:05.871 --> 25:08.066
And why would that agenda
focus on a nonessential

25:08.139 --> 25:09.163
area of the ship?

25:09.241 --> 25:10.208
l don't know, but it feels

25:10.275 --> 25:11.867
like we're being pecked
to death by ducks.

25:11.977 --> 25:13.911
We can't just stay on this
course and wait to see

25:13.979 --> 25:15.207
what they have in store for us.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.646
l agree. lt's time
to reexamine our game plan.

25:17.716 --> 25:19.274
Mr. Paris, reverse course.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.579
Aye, Captain.

25:20.652 --> 25:22.347
Mr. Tierna should be
restricted to quarters

25:22.420 --> 25:23.682
on a secured deck
until further notice.

25:23.755 --> 25:25.882
Acknowledged.

25:45.143 --> 25:46.974
Dinnertime, Mr. Suder.

25:47.045 --> 25:50.412
We have
a fine leola root soup tonight.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.747
l'm not hungry.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.252
Red Alert.

26:02.327 --> 26:03.487
l'm afraid we have to go.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.462
l'll leave it here.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.532
Just in case.

26:15.607 --> 26:17.234
How many do you count,
Mr. Tuvok?

26:17.309 --> 26:20.870
Eight large carrier vessels,
confirmed Kazon signatures.

26:20.979 --> 26:23.447
Funny how they show up
right after we reverse course.

26:23.515 --> 26:24.482
Time to intercept?

26:24.549 --> 26:25.743
Eight minutes.

26:25.817 --> 26:28.843
Their attack formation is
a classic Cardassian echelon.

26:28.920 --> 26:29.852
Curious.

26:29.921 --> 26:30.910
They have left us

26:30.989 --> 26:33.389
with an obvious avenue
of escape, Captain.

26:36.361 --> 26:38.295
You're right.
lt is curious.

26:38.363 --> 26:40.524
Too curious for me.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.090
l don't know what's down
that avenue of escape,

26:43.168 --> 26:45.693
Mr. Tuvok, but l like
to choose my own way.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.034
Set a course
to intercept their lead ship.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.573
Aye, Captain.

26:50.642 --> 26:52.371
Battle stations.

27:05.023 --> 27:06.251
Time to intercept?

27:06.324 --> 27:07.985
Three minutes, ten seconds...

27:08.059 --> 27:09.720
give or take a photon torpedo.

27:09.794 --> 27:10.658
Mr. Kim?

27:14.466 --> 27:16.491
Echo displacement ready,
Captain.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.058
Send in the cavalry.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.899
Activating deflector grid.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.807
They should be seeing the same
thing on their scanners--

27:25.877 --> 27:27.708
ten ships
with Talaxian signatures.

27:27.779 --> 27:29.804
Four of the Kazon ships
are breaking formation.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.746
Confirmed.
They're changing course.

27:31.816 --> 27:33.044
They took the bait.

27:33.118 --> 27:34.813
That only leaves four
for us to handle.

27:34.886 --> 27:36.251
l like those odds better
than eight to one.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.253
Two minutes to intercept.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.187
Janeway to Torres.

27:39.257 --> 27:40.918
We're ready down here, Captain.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.187
All the new holo-projectors
are on line.

27:43.261 --> 27:44.922
We can create
three Talaxian ships

27:44.996 --> 27:46.258
whenever you want to.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.697
ln about a minute and a half,
B'Elanna. Stand by.

27:48.767 --> 27:51.497
Perhaps we should try
one last systems check.

27:51.569 --> 27:53.230
We've already done it twice.

27:53.304 --> 27:55.397
l'm new at this,
and we've never put

27:55.473 --> 27:57.771
such a demand on
the holo-generators before.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.810
We should've boosted
the power input.

27:59.878 --> 28:02.244
The defense systems are going
to need all the auxiliary power

28:02.347 --> 28:03.780
we have, Doctor.

28:03.815 --> 28:05.077
We might try a preliminary...

28:05.150 --> 28:06.549
Doctor!

28:06.618 --> 28:08.347
lt'll work.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.819
Everything'll be fine.

28:09.888 --> 28:11.287
l'm not worried.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.094
Here we go.

28:17.162 --> 28:19.323
They are randomly detonating
torpedoes in our flight path.

28:19.397 --> 28:21.422
Shields are holding.
No damage.

28:21.499 --> 28:22.989
Hold your fire, Mr. Tuvok.

28:23.068 --> 28:25.298
They may have torpedoes
to waste-- we don't.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.235
30 seconds to intercept.

28:27.305 --> 28:28.829
Take us out of warp.

28:28.907 --> 28:29.999
Engaging impulse engines.

28:30.075 --> 28:31.542
Power to all weapon systems.

28:31.609 --> 28:32.769
Stand by phasers.

28:32.844 --> 28:35.574
Kazon vessel, 10,000 kilometers
off our starboard bow.

28:35.647 --> 28:36.614
Not yet.

28:36.681 --> 28:37.739
6,000 kilometers.

28:37.816 --> 28:38.840
Not yet.

28:38.917 --> 28:40.509
5,000.

28:40.585 --> 28:42.280
3,000... 2,000.

28:42.353 --> 28:43.615
Now!

28:50.161 --> 28:52.755
lnitiating evasive maneuvers,
beta sequence.

28:52.831 --> 28:54.594
Two more
Kazon ships approaching.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.865
Shields at 90 percent.

29:05.844 --> 29:08.278
Janeway to Torres.
lnitiate holo-programs.

29:08.346 --> 29:09.677
Acknowledged.

29:09.748 --> 29:10.942
Energizing.

29:22.994 --> 29:24.427
That's two.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.225
And here's number three.

29:32.604 --> 29:36.734
Help! Man overboard!

29:49.521 --> 29:51.045
Doctor, are you there?

29:51.122 --> 29:52.817
Are you all right?

29:52.891 --> 29:56.884
l told you we should have run
one last systems check.

30:02.534 --> 30:03.592
Fourth Kazon ship, dead ahead.

30:03.668 --> 30:05.465
But they're dividing
their fire, Captain.

30:05.537 --> 30:06.799
The holograms are working.

30:06.871 --> 30:07.895
Ready photons.

30:07.972 --> 30:08.939
Torpedoes loaded.

30:09.007 --> 30:10.599
Take us about, Mr. Paris.

30:10.675 --> 30:12.643
We want a good angle
on that fourth ship.

30:12.710 --> 30:15.907
Coming about, 141 mark 20.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.811
Fire photon number one.

30:20.351 --> 30:21.477
Full starboard roll.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.748
Evasive maneuvers,
lambda sequence.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.189
Fire.

31:01.226 --> 31:03.490
Shields at 85 percent
and holding.

31:03.561 --> 31:05.358
Minor damage reported, Deck 14.

31:05.430 --> 31:08.024
Come about to 143 mark 060.

31:08.099 --> 31:09.361
Coming about.

31:09.434 --> 31:10.423
Ready photons.

31:10.501 --> 31:12.765
Dispersal pattern sierra. Fire.

31:42.367 --> 31:44.835
l'm reading a massive discharge
on Deck 8.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.871
We've lost
a primary plasma conduit.

31:46.938 --> 31:48.963
Deck 8-- Tierna's quarters.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.270
Damage control teams to Deck 8.

31:51.342 --> 31:53.401
l'm showing power failures
all over the ship.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.387
We've lost power
to the new holodeck grid.

32:03.454 --> 32:05.615
l can't restore it.

32:07.025 --> 32:08.014
B'Elanna, are you all right?

32:08.092 --> 32:09.252
Yes, Captain.

32:09.327 --> 32:12.057
But it looks like our reactant
injector controls were hit.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.062
Stand by.

32:13.131 --> 32:14.155
All three Kazon ships

32:14.232 --> 32:16.723
are concentrating
their fire on us now, Captain.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.666
Shields at 70 percent
and falling.

32:18.736 --> 32:20.829
Starboard targeting
scanners are off-line.

32:20.905 --> 32:23.373
Evasive maneuvers, Mr. Paris.
Gamma sequence.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.272
Engineering, l need warp power.

32:25.343 --> 32:26.935
We can't go to warp, Captain.

32:27.045 --> 32:29.513
The containment field
generator has been damaged.

32:29.580 --> 32:30.877
l'm attempting to bypass.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.417
Captain, if l can get a shuttle
through the crossfire,

32:33.484 --> 32:35.952
l can go back and bring
the Talaxians to help us.

32:37.922 --> 32:39.253
Chakotay, take the conn.

32:39.324 --> 32:40.586
Good luck, Lieutenant.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.040
Shuttle is clear.
So far, so good.

33:02.113 --> 33:04.377
Give him as much cover fire
as you can, Tuvok.

33:04.449 --> 33:05.609
Aye, Captain.

33:12.256 --> 33:13.723
Voyager to Paris.

33:16.227 --> 33:17.922
Please respond.

33:18.029 --> 33:19.394
Tom, can you hear me?

33:21.532 --> 33:23.124
l've lost contact
with the shuttle.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.133
Navigational array is off-line.

33:27.205 --> 33:29.230
We've lost power
to forward phasers.

33:30.441 --> 33:31.931
Shields at 30 percent.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.068
They're buckling.

33:36.881 --> 33:38.439
Report.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.416
The driver coil assembly
has been destroyed.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.316
lmpulse engines are off-line.

33:42.387 --> 33:44.412
We're being boarded through
the shuttle bays, Captain.

33:44.489 --> 33:48.721
Phaser fights reported
on Decks 5, 6, 7.

33:48.793 --> 33:49.725
lntruder alert.

33:49.794 --> 33:51.489
Security to Decks 5 through 7.

33:51.562 --> 33:53.325
Begin evacuation.

33:53.398 --> 33:55.298
Janeway to computer.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.357
lnitiate self-destruct sequence.

33:57.435 --> 34:00.097
Authorization: Janeway-pi-1-1-0.

34:00.171 --> 34:02.139
Set at ten minutes.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.674
Unable to initiate
self-destruct sequence

34:04.742 --> 34:07.438
due to damage
to secondary command processors.

34:10.248 --> 34:11.237
Stay where you are.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.282
Don't move!

34:16.853 --> 34:18.286
Hold your fire.

34:19.524 --> 34:20.513
Get down there!

34:21.659 --> 34:23.320
You! Move!

34:55.159 --> 34:56.751
l want to speak to Maje Culluh.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.989
Easily arranged, Captain.

35:01.199 --> 35:02.666
Hello, everyone.

35:04.068 --> 35:07.504
What do you think
of your son, Chakotay?

35:07.572 --> 35:08.869
He has your eyes.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.305
Don't you think?

35:10.374 --> 35:13.537
Thank goodness he doesn't look
too human.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.511
You all have
such weak foreheads.

35:15.580 --> 35:16.672
May he grow up never knowing

35:16.747 --> 35:18.544
the contempt his father has
for his mother.

35:18.616 --> 35:21.084
l think l can assure you
of that, Commander.

35:21.152 --> 35:23.382
l intend to take him
for my own son.

35:23.454 --> 35:26.912
A man who would violate a woman
under his own command...

35:26.991 --> 35:28.083
What?

35:28.159 --> 35:29.683
...doesn't deserve a son.

35:31.195 --> 35:32.355
ls that what she told you?

35:32.430 --> 35:35.297
The boy will be trained
as a Nistrim askara.

35:35.366 --> 35:38.460
Already he has helped us win the
greatest battle in our history.

35:38.536 --> 35:39.468
Culluh.

35:39.537 --> 35:42.097
l'd like to discuss
what happens now.

35:49.213 --> 35:53.673
You'll be given no more respect
than any Kazon woman...

35:53.751 --> 35:56.584
now that your ship
and technology are mine.

35:56.654 --> 35:59.748
l will tell you
when you may speak.

35:59.824 --> 36:00.916
Allow my crew to live.

36:01.025 --> 36:03.118
They were following my orders.

36:03.194 --> 36:04.684
You're even worse than she is.

36:05.763 --> 36:08.596
What is it about the women
from your Quadrant?

36:08.666 --> 36:12.466
You know she contradicts me
in front of the senior askara?

36:12.537 --> 36:16.974
My own woman disputing
her maje in front of others.

36:17.041 --> 36:19.066
This is your fault.

36:19.143 --> 36:21.634
You've let your women
get out of control.

36:21.712 --> 36:24.772
You know you have
my deepest respect, Maje.

36:26.951 --> 36:28.077
Why is it so dark in here?

36:28.152 --> 36:30.052
Somebody turn on the lights.

36:31.556 --> 36:34.753
Order the repair crews
to begin work immediately.

36:34.825 --> 36:38.852
l want to leave for the Hanon
system as soon as possible.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.454
What's in the Hanon system?

36:40.531 --> 36:42.226
Your new home.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.927
Take them to a cargo bay.

36:44.001 --> 36:45.935
Have the whole crew
brought there.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.129
Check all quarters.

36:51.342 --> 36:52.468
Move.

36:57.782 --> 36:59.340
Good-bye, Chakotay.

37:01.352 --> 37:03.411
l'll take good care of our son.

37:05.456 --> 37:09.153
Oh, are you hungry,
my brave little boy?

37:20.204 --> 37:22.365
You! Move!

37:22.440 --> 37:23.407
Keep moving!

37:27.812 --> 37:28.779
This is outrageous!

37:28.846 --> 37:30.473
Shut up!

37:41.359 --> 37:43.725
Computer, activate
medical holographic recall.

37:43.794 --> 37:44.920
Set for 12 hours.
Mark.

37:51.302 --> 37:52.200
Check every room.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.238
ln here.

37:54.305 --> 37:55.636
Get back.

38:07.918 --> 38:08.907
Keep moving!

38:28.873 --> 38:31.239
Essential repairs
are complete, Maje.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.506
We have accounted for all but
two of the Federation crew.

38:34.578 --> 38:36.443
There is also a shuttle missing.

38:36.514 --> 38:38.846
Yes, we destroyed the shuttle
as it was leaving.

38:38.916 --> 38:40.508
Has that been confirmed?

38:43.487 --> 38:44.784
Fine.

38:44.855 --> 38:46.652
Have the other ships
send out search parties.

38:46.724 --> 38:48.919
Confirm the shuttle
was destroyed.

38:49.026 --> 38:50.118
And even if they find wreckage

38:50.194 --> 38:51.422
that seems to be
from the shuttle,

38:51.495 --> 38:53.690
tell them to check
for a recent warp trail.

39:07.678 --> 39:11.944
Stand by to engage
atmospheric thrusters.

39:17.488 --> 39:18.853
Prepare for landing.

39:18.923 --> 39:21.153
Activate the viewscreen.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.529
Extend landing struts.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.344
Ready environmental controls!

40:09.974 --> 40:11.737
Disengage engines.

40:13.677 --> 40:16.305
Secure thruster exhaust.

40:48.345 --> 40:50.711
A fitting end for a people

40:50.781 --> 40:53.375
who would not share
their technology.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.045
Let's see if you manage
to survive...

40:56.153 --> 40:58.314
without it.

41:04.695 --> 41:06.458
All right.

41:06.530 --> 41:07.519
Let's go.

41:07.598 --> 41:09.589
We've got to find
water and shelter.

41:26.116 --> 41:28.346
We'll divide
the crew into teams.

41:28.419 --> 41:30.319
Each of you will be
a team leader.

41:30.387 --> 41:33.288
Make it clear to all your people
that we expect to be rescued

41:33.357 --> 41:36.485
and our job is to survive
until help arrives.

41:36.560 --> 41:37.822
Do you really think it's likely

41:37.895 --> 41:39.362
that someone will find us,
Captain?

41:39.430 --> 41:40.590
You're the morale officer,
Neelix.

41:40.664 --> 41:41.995
You give me an answer.

41:42.066 --> 41:44.534
Help is on the way!

41:44.602 --> 41:47.298
Maybe Tom's shuttle got through.

41:47.371 --> 41:48.838
lt's very important
that this crew

41:48.906 --> 41:49.998
be given a sense of hope.

41:50.074 --> 41:52.235
That's our most important
job right now.

41:52.309 --> 41:54.470
Our top priority
is drinking water.

41:54.545 --> 41:56.012
Second is shelter
to spend the night.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.638
A clearing
with a protected side

41:57.715 --> 41:59.979
like the base of a cliff
would be best.

42:00.050 --> 42:02.985
Food, fuel-- look for all
the basic survival requirements.

42:03.020 --> 42:06.251
That includes anything that can
be used as a tool or a weapon.

42:06.290 --> 42:08.258
We'll reconvene here
in about two hours.

42:08.325 --> 42:10.020
All right,
start dividing the crew.

42:10.094 --> 42:12.528
Looks like we don't have
much daylight left.

42:12.596 --> 42:13.927
We'll spread the teams out

42:13.998 --> 42:15.829
in a standard
alpha search pattern

42:15.900 --> 42:17.162
to see what we have
to work with.

42:17.234 --> 42:18.929
Chakotay, Torres,
you're with me.

42:19.036 --> 42:20.333
Alpha team here.

42:20.404 --> 42:21.769
Beta team, this way.

42:21.839 --> 42:23.830
Gamma team.

42:23.908 --> 42:25.876
Delta team with me.

42:31.949 --> 42:34.417
The planet seems to be
seismically active.

42:34.485 --> 42:36.749
At first glance,
it's an M-Class planet

42:36.820 --> 42:38.981
in a Pliocene stage
of evolution.

42:39.089 --> 42:41.819
Comparable to Earth
several million years ago.

43:03.180 --> 43:04.340
Captain.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
