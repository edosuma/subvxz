01:15.767 --> 01:20.000
It was a nice funeral,
wasn't it, Al?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.334
Come on, honey.

01:22.334 --> 01:24.234
Come on.

01:24.234 --> 01:25.234
He's dead, Peg.

01:25.234 --> 01:27.534
He's dead.

01:27.534 --> 01:28.734
What am I
gonna do now?

01:28.734 --> 01:29.734
Oh, easy, Al.

01:29.734 --> 01:31.701
Nobody lives forever.

01:31.701 --> 01:32.934
I thought he would.

01:32.934 --> 01:35.033
He had a nice full life.

01:35.033 --> 01:36.534
Now, be strong, Al.

01:36.534 --> 01:38.968
You're just gonna
have to face the fact.

01:38.968 --> 01:41.000
Your barber is dead.

01:43.033 --> 01:44.634
Why did it
have to be him,

01:44.634 --> 01:46.501
who meant so much
to so many?

01:46.501 --> 01:47.701
Why couldn't it
have been somebody

01:47.701 --> 01:49.133
nobody
would have missed,

01:49.133 --> 01:50.934
a wretch
of a human being?

01:50.934 --> 01:52.467
Why couldn't it have been
your mother?

01:54.501 --> 01:56.133
Well, I'm sure there's
still someone alive

01:56.133 --> 01:57.968
who can cut all 12
of your remaining hairs

01:57.968 --> 02:00.100
for a buck
and a quarter.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.467
It wasn't the money,
Peg.

02:01.467 --> 02:03.367
Tony knew my hair,
and he cared.

02:03.367 --> 02:04.434
Remember that time

02:04.434 --> 02:06.734
I had that bad case
of dandruff in '83?

02:06.734 --> 02:09.000
Yeah, I remember.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.800
The whole family gathered
some coal and a carrot,

02:10.800 --> 02:14.033
and we made
Frosty the Dandruff Man.

02:14.033 --> 02:15.868
Tony was there

02:15.868 --> 02:18.133
to hold my hand
through that rough time.

02:18.133 --> 02:19.567
Going to Tony was
a family tradition.

02:19.567 --> 02:21.100
My father went to him.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.133
I went to him.

02:22.133 --> 02:23.400
I took Bud to him...

02:23.400 --> 02:24.801
till the other kids
started calling him

02:24.801 --> 02:27.133
"Bud the Bowl Head."

02:27.133 --> 02:28.934
It broke my heart
when Bud refused to go.

02:28.934 --> 02:30.601
I had to tell Tony
Bud died.

02:37.467 --> 02:38.667
We wept together.

02:38.667 --> 02:40.067
That's the kind of guy
Tony was.

02:40.067 --> 02:41.701
Everybody loved him.

02:41.701 --> 02:43.701
Sorry I'm late,

02:43.701 --> 02:45.701
but I wanted to wait
till they packed the dirt

02:45.701 --> 02:48.000
over the old butcher.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.400
That old butcher cried
when you died, Bud.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.701
I'll bet he did.

02:53.701 --> 02:56.100
Who else would let him
put a cereal bowl on their head

02:56.100 --> 02:57.334
while he said,

02:57.334 --> 02:59.901
"I'm a-gonna make you
look like Sinatra."

02:59.901 --> 03:02.634
Bud, your father's right.

03:02.634 --> 03:06.000
We should show a little respect,
even for the hated dead,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.801
and like my mother said
when I married your father,

03:08.801 --> 03:13.334
"If you can't feel it, fake it."

03:13.334 --> 03:15.868
Yeah, and if you don't care
anymore, marry it.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.701
Now, I'd like
a moment of silence

03:19.701 --> 03:21.200
for my barber.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.734
Excuse me.

03:23.734 --> 03:25.901
Amen.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.434
Well,

03:27.434 --> 03:28.968
now that Tony's worm food,

03:28.968 --> 03:31.667
I can get
out of these funeral clothes.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.133
Oh, Dad,

03:33.133 --> 03:34.400
you know how

03:34.400 --> 03:36.167
I've been bothering you
about a sports car?

03:36.167 --> 03:37.767
Well, forget it.

03:37.767 --> 03:39.267
I want a hearse.

03:39.267 --> 03:40.667
I was just cruising around
the cemetery

03:40.667 --> 03:42.400
with Boris, the driver.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.667
Oh, God, was it cool.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.067
On Friday night,
he's taking me out

03:45.067 --> 03:46.934
and promised to have
a real dead body in it...

03:48.901 --> 03:51.634
But Mom said it's wrong
to use a guy for his hearse,

03:51.634 --> 03:53.868
so can I have one of my own,
please?

03:53.868 --> 03:55.434
Well, Al,

03:55.434 --> 03:59.234
she has been doing
better in school.

03:59.234 --> 04:02.167
Why am I thinking
they buried the wrong guy?

04:04.133 --> 04:05.300
Cheer up, honey.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.300
Your day will come.

04:07.300 --> 04:09.501
And when it does, you'll be glad
we have that hearse.

04:09.501 --> 04:10.834
[DOORBELL RINGS]

04:14.501 --> 04:16.500
Al, I know you were
at a funeral and all,

04:16.500 --> 04:18.701
so this might be a bad time
to bring this up,

04:18.701 --> 04:20.500
but did you happen to come
into our yard

04:20.500 --> 04:21.701
in the middle of the night

04:21.701 --> 04:23.968
and steal all our roses?

04:23.968 --> 04:27.667
Steve, I've never been
so insulted in my life.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.868
Well, then I guess
this isn't your watch.

04:32.634 --> 04:34.067
So who died?

04:34.067 --> 04:35.300
A close family member?

04:35.300 --> 04:36.434
No, worse. My barber.

04:36.434 --> 04:37.901
It hit me
pretty hard, too.

04:37.901 --> 04:39.300
Now, who am I
going to get

04:39.300 --> 04:40.300
to cut my hair?

04:40.300 --> 04:41.300
Well, why don't you

04:41.300 --> 04:43.167
just do what you do
with your lawn?

04:43.167 --> 04:46.200
Park your car on it,
and let it die.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.267
Thanks, Marce,

04:47.267 --> 04:48.901
but much like the hair
on your legs,

04:48.901 --> 04:51.567
I need the help
of a trained professional.

04:56.367 --> 04:57.701
Look, Al,

04:57.701 --> 04:59.734
why don't you
just go to my barber?

04:59.734 --> 05:00.734
Well, thanks, Steve,

05:00.734 --> 05:02.667
but I still care
how I look.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.901
Dad, why don't you
just go to Kelly's guy,

05:04.901 --> 05:07.467
Mr. Albino?

05:07.467 --> 05:09.267
Or you could always go
to Bud's guy

05:09.267 --> 05:12.033
at the Pimple Emporium.

05:12.033 --> 05:13.834
Ask for Mr. Squeeze-It.

05:15.968 --> 05:18.200
Look how I live.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.501
Come on, Al,

05:19.501 --> 05:21.200
the kids'll think
you're serious.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.300
Honey, you're making
a big thing over nothing.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.601
Usually,
you're a big thing

05:25.601 --> 05:26.501
who makes nothing.

05:30.868 --> 05:33.534
Anyway, you can get
your hair cut anywhere.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.300
There are thousands
of stylists in this city.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.300
Yeah, stylists.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.300
I want a barber
with a barber pole,

05:39.300 --> 05:41.434
with a little dog
that lays on the floor

05:41.434 --> 05:42.834
and scratches
and bites at his fleas.

05:42.834 --> 05:45.234
Where am I going to see
a sight like that again, Peg?

05:45.234 --> 05:47.200
Look next to me
while I'm sleeping.

05:48.901 --> 05:49.901
Al, why don't you

05:49.901 --> 05:51.334
just find some guy
with good hair

05:51.334 --> 05:53.067
and ask him
where he gets it cut?

05:53.067 --> 05:55.400
Sure, I'll compliment him
on his great hair,

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
and then he'll
compliment me

05:56.400 --> 05:57.534
on my bedroom eyes,

05:57.534 --> 06:00.400
and we'll live together
and make terrariums.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.367
I'm going upstairs
to be alone with my grief.

06:04.367 --> 06:07.767
Well, make sure
to pull up the Air Wick.

06:10.067 --> 06:12.767
Well, I gave Buck
a nice big dish of water.

06:12.767 --> 06:15.868
Now I'm gonna take him
for a walk on Tony's grave.

06:15.868 --> 06:17.467
He didn't get to go
to the funeral,

06:17.467 --> 06:19.067
but I know he wants
to say goodbye

06:19.067 --> 06:20.667
in his own special way.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.467
He's quite a little guy,
isn't he?

06:26.467 --> 06:29.968
Gee, Al seems to be
taking this pretty badly.

06:29.968 --> 06:31.133
Death is something

06:31.133 --> 06:33.133
you're never really
prepared for.

06:33.133 --> 06:34.334
Well, it does
make you think.

06:34.334 --> 06:37.200
I mean, one minute,
you're in perfect health,

06:37.200 --> 06:38.434
and then
the next minute, poof!

06:38.434 --> 06:40.501
Al's dead.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.667
Gee, and I'd be left
with no income

06:42.667 --> 06:44.434
and no insurance.

06:44.434 --> 06:45.434
What would I do?

06:45.434 --> 06:47.868
Get a job?

06:47.868 --> 06:51.467
No, I said,
what would I do?

06:53.100 --> 06:55.834
I mean, of course
I would remarry,

06:55.834 --> 07:00.000
but that could take
up to nine months...

07:00.000 --> 07:04.133
and what if Al didn't die
till I was in my 40s?

07:04.133 --> 07:06.167
Then where would I be?

07:09.567 --> 07:10.901
Well, thank God

07:10.901 --> 07:13.067
Steve cares enough
to get insurance.

07:13.067 --> 07:16.734
Why, he's worth more dead
than he is alive.

07:16.734 --> 07:17.968
Well, so is Al.

07:17.968 --> 07:19.000
You know,

07:19.000 --> 07:22.033
what with food stamps
and welfare and all.

07:24.901 --> 07:27.033
How much is yours
worth dead?

07:27.033 --> 07:28.701
A cool mill.

07:28.701 --> 07:30.634
Wow.

07:36.133 --> 07:39.701
What I could do
with a million dollars.

07:39.701 --> 07:40.701
Hey, Marcy,

07:40.701 --> 07:43.133
knowing he's worth
that much,

07:43.133 --> 07:44.133
have you ever,

07:44.133 --> 07:46.367
late at night
while he's sleeping,

07:46.367 --> 07:48.000
thought about...

07:55.868 --> 07:59.367
But all this
is pie in the sky.

07:59.367 --> 08:02.601
Peggy, you really should
get insurance for Al.

08:02.601 --> 08:04.100
Uh, honey...

08:04.100 --> 08:05.300
I thought

08:05.300 --> 08:07.767
I was only insured
for $250,000.

08:07.767 --> 08:10.200
Steve, please.
This is girl talk.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.868
I know an insurance group

08:12.868 --> 08:15.501
that not only will insure you
over the phone,

08:15.501 --> 08:17.067
but will also raise
your coverage

08:17.067 --> 08:19.634
without your husband
even knowing.

08:19.634 --> 08:21.234
I thought we were
going to discuss things

08:21.234 --> 08:22.567
that affect us both.

08:22.567 --> 08:25.501
This doesn't affect you, Steve.

08:28.567 --> 08:31.467
You'll be dead.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.133
Anyhow, Peggy, all you need

08:33.133 --> 08:35.534
is for Al to give
a sample of his blood and urine,

08:35.534 --> 08:36.534
and you're home.

08:36.534 --> 08:37.634
Hmm.

08:37.634 --> 08:39.133
Well, the urine
would be easy.

08:39.133 --> 08:40.534
I could just put
a little cup

08:40.534 --> 08:42.601
five feet
from the bowl...

08:47.501 --> 08:50.901
But the blood
is gonna be tough.

08:50.901 --> 08:53.367
I could use
a million, though.

08:55.501 --> 08:58.167
We all could.

08:58.167 --> 08:59.200
Well, we have to go.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.601
Steve has to sweep out
the gutters,

09:00.601 --> 09:02.434
and I'm going to hold
the ladder for him.

09:04.968 --> 09:06.267
Uh...

09:06.267 --> 09:07.267
I love you, Marcy.

09:07.267 --> 09:09.567
That's nice, dear.

09:09.567 --> 09:12.267
"First name," Al.

09:12.267 --> 09:15.467
"Last name," Bundy.

09:15.467 --> 09:19.767
"Sex," not worth mentioning.

09:19.767 --> 09:20.767
Peg,

09:20.767 --> 09:22.767
the darnedest thing...

09:22.767 --> 09:25.334
when I woke up,
my neck was bleeding...

09:28.934 --> 09:29.934
And there was a--

09:29.934 --> 09:31.834
There was a jar between my legs.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.434
Well, uh,

09:37.434 --> 09:41.467
maybe you dreamt
you were making preserves.

09:41.467 --> 09:44.100
Yeah,
that must be it.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.100
Peg, who am I
gonna get to cut my hair?

09:46.100 --> 09:47.501
I called all my friends
last night.

09:47.501 --> 09:50.067
What did he say?

09:50.067 --> 09:52.701
He said,

09:52.701 --> 09:54.701
"Yeah, I'm still in San Quentin
for killing the wife,

09:54.701 --> 09:56.534
but it was worth it."

09:59.300 --> 10:00.667
And the rest of them said

10:00.667 --> 10:03.701
that they're gonna start
going to...salons.

10:03.701 --> 10:05.434
Hey, Peg, these are plumbers,

10:05.434 --> 10:07.534
construction workers,
auto mechanics.

10:07.534 --> 10:12.601
Oh, unlike you,
skilled illiterates.

10:12.601 --> 10:13.734
Come on, honey.

10:13.734 --> 10:15.734
What's wrong
with going to salons?

10:15.734 --> 10:16.767
Do they have

10:16.767 --> 10:18.934
regular checker games
in salons, Peg?

10:18.934 --> 10:21.167
Do they run the numbers
in salons, Peg?

10:21.167 --> 10:23.000
Will they laugh in a salon
when you say...

10:23.000 --> 10:27.501
"What do women and dog doody
have in common?

10:27.501 --> 10:29.734
The older they get,
the easier they are to pick up."

10:29.734 --> 10:31.601
Would they, Peg?

10:38.501 --> 10:39.601
Probably not, Al.

10:39.601 --> 10:40.701
Then I'm not going,

10:40.701 --> 10:42.200
and I'll tell you
something else.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.367
I need a place
that'll cut my nose hair.

10:45.367 --> 10:46.367
Tony would.

10:46.367 --> 10:47.868
He was the greatest.

10:47.868 --> 10:51.167
He'd really get in there.

10:51.167 --> 10:54.267
Will a salon cut my nose hair,
Peg?

10:58.734 --> 11:00.234
Die broke, Peg,

but first I'm find a barber,

11:01.968 --> 11:03.200
a real man,

11:03.200 --> 11:05.434
a man who likes girls
but hates women.

11:10.834 --> 11:12.033
Look at him, kids.

11:12.033 --> 11:14.300
He's worth a million dollars.

11:23.400 --> 11:28.767
I'm not getting a haircut
until I find a barber.

11:28.767 --> 11:30.434
It's time, Al.

11:30.434 --> 11:31.801
Last night you were snoring,

11:31.801 --> 11:33.601
and your nose hairs
were going in and out

11:33.601 --> 11:36.634
like a trombone.

11:36.634 --> 11:38.734
I'm afraid one day
they're gonna reach out

11:38.734 --> 11:42.501
and suck in one of the kids.

11:42.501 --> 11:47.467
Don't you think
I want to get a haircut, Peg?

the new <i>Dead</i> album?

11:53.167 --> 11:56.701
But I'm trying
to make a statement here.

11:56.701 --> 11:57.868
I'm saying,

11:57.868 --> 11:59.234
"Let's not let
the barber disappear."

God knows they've taken
everything else away from us

give you video games.

12:06.901 --> 12:09.300
if a monkey can make it
to the top of a building?

Unless he's up there
to throw off his wife,

it doesn't matter to me.

12:16.234 --> 12:17.767

12:21.868 --> 12:23.033
Is he brain-dead?

12:23.033 --> 12:26.300
Because we just might
be able to collect.

seen cartoons lately?

Peg, remember
when a mouse

12:35.901 --> 12:37.367
could hit a cat
over the head

12:37.367 --> 12:38.968
with a frying pan
and flatten his head?

12:38.968 --> 12:40.200
Now you know what they do?

12:40.200 --> 12:42.934
They go into therapy
and talk it out...

12:42.934 --> 12:44.334

12:44.334 --> 12:47.100

Well, we can't get

this would happen to me.

away from me.

Wherever Tony is,

13:13.300 --> 13:14.701
I hope they buried him face down

13:14.701 --> 13:16.701
so he never has to live
to see my shame

about those Bears?

Well, if people
wouldn't feed them,

they wouldn't raid
the campsites.
