the smoke you see
indicates that it's burning.

02:59.379 --> 03:02.007
I'm on fire.
Now, put a little water on it,
would you, please?

03:02.081 --> 03:04.049
What happened to this guy?
Can you hear me, Frank?

03:04.117 --> 03:05.607
We were doing a scene.

03:05.685 --> 03:06.743
Did you hear me?
A little water.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.047
I'm the special effects guy
in this movie

03:08.121 --> 03:09.645
and I had the whole cave
rigged with charges

03:09.722 --> 03:12.190

Acting?

Will you please
get me out of here?
My shoulder is burning.

I can't, pal.

interpreting this role.

04:21.961 --> 04:23.861

04:25.765 --> 04:28.529

04:30.270 --> 04:33.034
is that you hold
the producer innocent
of any injuries incurred.

will you, Frankie?

04:34.407 --> 04:37.638

I see the background
of the character,

04:37.710 --> 04:39.769

on an ice floe in Antarctica.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.939

it's brakes.

is you get this guy

Okay. See, what you do is,
you take your gold off, right?

07:02.221 --> 07:04.655
You dip it in cooking oil,
stick it in the microwave,

07:04.724 --> 07:07.056
cook it for 15 minutes.
Then you take it out.

07:07.126 --> 07:10.562
Now be careful,
'cause that oil is
going to be real hot. Okay?

07:10.630 --> 07:13.121
Then you wash
it in cold water.
Doesn't have to be that cold.

07:13.199 --> 07:16.498

fine. Then you wipe it
with a clean rag.

her eggs in her cave,
that was like close to genius.

I had several operatives
working on various film sets.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.504
When I needed you,
I knew where to find you.

10:10.576 --> 10:12.100
Feels like a spook operation.

10:12.178 --> 10:15.011
Well, I'm not officially
attached to anybody,

10:15.081 --> 10:17.743
but seems there's always
something for me to do.

a Spanish airliner
was taken by terrorists,

10:33.499 --> 10:35.967
currently on the ground
on the runway in Barcelona.

10:36.035 --> 10:37.024
Yeah. I saw it on TV.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.593
There is a man
on that airplane

10:38.671 --> 10:40.832
that is very important to me

10:41.440 --> 10:43.533
and, I think, to you.

10:48.648 --> 10:52.880
Apparently, your last mission
in Vietnam was given to you
by a Colonel Morrison.

10:52.952 --> 10:55.580
You committed a crime,
so you say, on his orders,

10:55.655 --> 10:57.748
but he died
and could not confirm it.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.485
My understanding is
there was one other man
in that office

11:00.559 --> 11:01.548
when the orders were given.

11:01.627 --> 11:03.356
Captain Curtis.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.590
But he died with Morrison
when Headquarters was hit.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.566
We think not.
We think Captain Curtis
is the passenger

11:08.634 --> 11:12.195
in seat 4-G
on that airliner in Barcelona.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.800
CARLA: Captain Josh Curtis,
presumed dead,

11:14.874 --> 11:18.310
and currently stranded
on Flight 387 in Barcelona.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.641
I'll be damned.

11:23.716 --> 11:24.978
Most probably.

11:25.217 --> 11:28.448
The U.S. Government can't
conduct covert operations
in Spain.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.423
However, the A-Team,
being a fugitive group
for that government,

11:32.491 --> 11:35.722
might get in there
and get Captain Curtis
off the plane.

11:36.529 --> 11:40.465
If you fail,
we won't even ask
for your bodies back,

11:40.533 --> 11:42.967
but if you succeed, well,

11:43.703 --> 11:46.900
this man could clear you
of all the charges
against you.

11:47.073 --> 11:48.370
What do you want with him?

11:48.441 --> 11:50.341
My customer wants him back.

11:56.582 --> 11:58.140
So, the United States
government,

11:58.217 --> 12:01.243
after chasing me since 1972
and finally catching me,

12:01.320 --> 12:04.847
is going to simply
just turn me loose

12:04.924 --> 12:07.449
and send me into Spain
with a pat on the back?

12:07.526 --> 12:09.824
To be totally honest with you,
Colonel,

12:11.597 --> 12:15.499
you are what I consider
a low-grade annoyance.

12:16.602 --> 12:19.969
You and your A-Team
kick up some
embarrassing headlines,

12:20.039 --> 12:22.769
make some staff officers
look woefully inept,

12:22.842 --> 12:25.777
but aside from that,
you amount to nothing.

12:25.845 --> 12:28.712
Say I get Captain Curtis
for you, what then?

12:28.781 --> 12:29.975
Well, if he supports
your claim

12:30.049 --> 12:33.280
that you were on a
government mission when you
robbed the bank in Hanoi,

12:33.352 --> 12:36.617
you and your men are free.
All charges are dropped.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.053
Okay. It's been fun.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.583
Give me a number
and I'll call you
and let you know.

12:41.660 --> 12:43.560
I want your answer now.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.525
And if you say no,

12:47.133 --> 12:49.829
you will go with me
back to Langley, Virginia,

12:49.902 --> 12:53.565
where you will be put on trial
and most likely executed.

12:53.839 --> 12:56.808
Well, I don't work alone.
And I can't speak
for the others.

12:56.876 --> 12:59.344
But you can try
and influence them.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.840
Now, all I need
is your commitment.

13:07.219 --> 13:08.447

13:09.455 --> 13:11.423

13:50.563 --> 13:54.590
Disobey me again
and you will be the first
to be sacrificed.

13:56.468 --> 13:58.436
MAN: Fradeen,
come here quick!

13:58.771 --> 14:00.739
Are you trying
to get us killed?

(SlGHS)

14:02.274 --> 14:04.139
What difference does it make?

14:04.577 --> 14:07.273
If we're late for that
arms shipment to LoBianca,
we're dead anyway.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.155
You will listen to me,
all of you!

14:19.225 --> 14:21.591
If you attempt
to do this one more time,

14:21.660 --> 14:24.527
I will kill all of them.
All the hostages!

14:24.997 --> 14:26.726
And I will start with her.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.509
Trouble parking,
Lieutenant?

14:48.587 --> 14:49.781
Hannibal was kidnapped.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.686
Never mind that.
Did you see what happened?

14:52.758 --> 14:54.555
Did you see
what that guy did to me?

14:54.627 --> 14:57.425
Who is this guy,
Frankie Santana?

14:57.529 --> 14:59.292
Oh, we've got
bigger problems, Face.

14:59.365 --> 15:00.662
What's going on, Hannibal?

15:00.733 --> 15:02.758
Who is this guy
who kidnapped you
from the hospital?

15:02.835 --> 15:06.635
I don't know. My instinct
tells me he's a commander
from the covert side.

15:06.705 --> 15:11.039
He could sell us out
and bury us, set us up,
clear us.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.207
It could go any way.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.112
He says Captain Curtis
is alive.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.382
Curtis is alive?
Mmm.

15:18.684 --> 15:23.018
Wait a minute. Then he could
testify that we hit that bank
in Hanoi under orders.

15:23.122 --> 15:27.183
Yeah. Then we'd be free
to be normal people.

15:27.693 --> 15:28.955
No offense, Murdock.

15:29.028 --> 15:30.120
None taken.

15:30.729 --> 15:32.321
I don't like this guy.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.059
But I think
it's the best chance
we're gonna get.

15:34.133 --> 15:37.227
How you know
he ain't lying, Hannibal?
Maybe Curtis is dead.

15:37.303 --> 15:40.170
I saw a videotape of Curtis
in the Barcelona airport.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.730
He's older and grayer,
but he looks like
the same guy.

15:42.808 --> 15:45.641
Now, not only is this gonna be
a covert operation
in a foreign country,

15:45.711 --> 15:48.703
we're gonna be working
for a guy I wouldn't trust
to take out the garbage.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.373
So I wanna take a vote.

15:50.883 --> 15:51.872
Face?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.316
Yeah. Let's do it.

15:53.552 --> 15:54.849
HANNlBAL: B.A.?

15:56.088 --> 15:57.248
Yeah.

15:57.323 --> 15:58.347
Murdock?

15:58.424 --> 15:59.448
Let her rip.

15:59.525 --> 16:01.652
Hannibal, just one question.

16:01.727 --> 16:05.754
How are we gonna
get onboard an airplane
controlled by terrorists?

16:18.544 --> 16:19.841
DlSHPAN: What's going on
out here?

16:19.912 --> 16:23.211
These guys over by the plane,
they got guns,
submachine guns.

16:23.282 --> 16:24.544
How you doing, bro?

16:24.616 --> 16:26.345
Oh, somebody overcooked
the spaghetti.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.079
It ain't spaghetti, fool,
it's my gold.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.986
I put it in the microwave
with oil like you said,
and now it's ruined.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.489
Is this 18 karat or 14 karat?

16:32.558 --> 16:34.549
It's 18 karat, fool.
I don't buy nothing
but the best.

16:34.626 --> 16:36.184
You should have told me, bro.

16:36.261 --> 16:38.195
See, your 18 karat
is very soft metal.

16:38.263 --> 16:40.163
You don't use a microwave
with 18 karat.

16:40.232 --> 16:42.291
You use a saucepan
over very low fire.

16:42.368 --> 16:43.733
Cooking oil,
you cut it with water,

16:43.802 --> 16:46.566
then you let it simmer
for about 10, 15 seconds tops.

16:46.638 --> 16:48.196
Hey, sucker,
who you take me for?

16:48.273 --> 16:49.763
Big, strong person.

16:50.409 --> 16:51.467
B.A.

16:52.411 --> 16:54.208
Now leave Frankie alone.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.276
He's our passport
aboard that Spanish airliner.

16:57.383 --> 16:58.611
BOTH: He's our what?

16:58.684 --> 17:02.415
Yeah, well, he does talk
a little bit too much,

17:02.921 --> 17:04.855
but he can make miracles
with special effects,

17:04.923 --> 17:06.857
and that's the way
I'm gonna get us
on that plane.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.688
B.A., come with me.

17:15.067 --> 17:18.468
Hey, I couldn't help noticing
that jacket is beginning
to dry out and crack.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.970
You ever try
tanning butter?

17:20.039 --> 17:21.973
Only on pancakes,
and it tastes pretty yucky.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.030
Huh?

17:23.108 --> 17:25.770
But it did turn my tongue
a nice shade of brown.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.373
Who is he?

17:28.446 --> 17:30.847
Well, when we get on a plane,
you can sit next to him.

17:30.916 --> 17:32.543
And if you figure him out,
let us know.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.176

Plane.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.187
Plane.
But you guys don't...

17:43.896 --> 17:45.796
That was good.
That was unique.

17:45.864 --> 17:48.059
Maybe later
you can explain it to me.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.420
These guys are
kind of brittle.

18:11.957 --> 18:12.946
The good-looking one...

18:13.025 --> 18:14.117
Me?

18:14.259 --> 18:15.624
The good-looking one.

18:15.694 --> 18:18.663
My bet is he used bailing wire
instead of number nine
on the brake cable.

18:18.730 --> 18:21.528
See, it'll crimp it,
cuts off the hydraulic fluid.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.034
Yeah,
that might be a good bet.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.503
Because Faceman, he's about
as mechanically inclined

18:26.572 --> 18:28.767
as a cage full of hamsters.

18:29.141 --> 18:31.268
I, on the other hand,
I only use bailing wire

18:31.343 --> 18:32.742
to bail out
boats full of water

18:32.811 --> 18:36.440
and that's only when there is
no bailing bucket available.

is updated,

to contact tower
at regular intervals.

secondary positions on tarmac.

by these briefings
as they occur.

Now, this is a two-0way
communication system.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.867
I can see you
as well as hear you.

19:31.937 --> 19:36.306
And I'm delighted to have
the famous A-Team
involved in this mission.

19:36.375 --> 19:37.774

My name is General Hunt
Stockwell, which is a matter
of little importance.

19:43.148 --> 19:45.912
However, I feel
that you should be informed
of whom you're working for.

19:45.984 --> 19:48.452

We're working for ourselves

19:48.520 --> 19:52.684
and generals don't usually
wear Brooks Brothers suits
on duty.

19:53.325 --> 19:56.726
Adequate observations.
I am a retired general,

19:57.262 --> 19:59.594
and you will find
a scrambler communication unit

19:59.665 --> 20:02.429
in that drawer
next to your right arm,
Colonel.

20:02.501 --> 20:05.163
It will allow you
to keep in touch with me
at all times.

20:05.237 --> 20:07.899
It is monitored
on channel 1 17.

20:10.275 --> 20:13.403
Your call letters will be
Empress 7 through 12.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.740
And again allow me to say
how delighted I am

20:15.814 --> 20:18.874
to have you engaged
in this operation.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.579
Once you have achieved
the objective,
please notify me,

20:21.653 --> 20:24.121
and we will have
immediate pick-0ups
made available.

20:24.423 --> 20:27.221
What do you want
with Captain Curtis?
You said you had your reasons.

20:27.292 --> 20:28.884

pull his cord?

21:00.993 --> 21:01.982
No.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.152
Oh!

21:49.308 --> 21:50.536
I don't like to fly.

21:50.609 --> 21:52.839
And I don't like being pushed
out of no airplane.

21:52.911 --> 21:54.742
All right, Sergeant,
this is a field operation.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.247

back there.

22:01.286 --> 22:03.345
That's it,
just lay it right there.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.756
Okay, the airfield
should be over there.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.355
Come on, B.A.,
we'll handle recon.

is getting worse.

to make their strike.

the communication devices?

whistling that tune
you used at Crystal Lake.

to stay together.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.482

So, that airliner
is on that field,

23:38.016 --> 23:39.449

over there, huh?

23:39.518 --> 23:40.610

And you guys really are
the A-Team?

23:42.654 --> 23:44.019
Nauseating, isn't it?

23:44.089 --> 23:45.579

the monster masher, the ld,

23:48.560 --> 23:52.291
the old aquamaniac,
is really the head
of the famous A-Team.

24:01.673 --> 24:05.404
That's gonna be tough.
Our only chance
will be at night.

24:05.477 --> 24:08.207

you can pull this off,

24:12.284 --> 24:13.342

24:13.985 --> 24:16.476

24:16.655 --> 24:18.816

24:19.291 --> 24:21.384

Okay, guys, we got to move.
They're splitting up
the hostages.

24:30.869 --> 24:32.598
I was afraid they might try
something like this.

24:32.671 --> 24:35.435
Now we can't make a move
on the plane
until we rescue those people.

24:35.507 --> 24:36.496
Right.

24:36.575 --> 24:38.805
We'll need the weapons.
Lieutenant, get us a vehicle.

24:38.877 --> 24:41.368
What? Wait a minute,
where am I gonna find
a vehicle?

24:41.446 --> 24:42.572
Go, Lieutenant.

24:42.647 --> 24:45.081
Here. Meet us on the road.
We'll try and keep in sight.
