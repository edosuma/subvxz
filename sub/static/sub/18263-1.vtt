03:31.880 --> 03:34.997
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

03:38.560 --> 03:41.438
<i>Constables Turner, Davies,
Cunningham and O'Connell,</i>

03:41.560 --> 03:43.596
<i>report to the station office immediately.</i>

03:43.720 --> 03:47.599
<i>Detective Sergeant Jessard, report to
the detective chief inspector's office.</i>

03:47.720 --> 03:51.508
<i>The detective constable on standby,
report to Detective Inspector Cameron.</i>

03:51.640 --> 03:56.111
<i>Constables Turner, Davies, Cunningham
and O'Connell, report to the station office.</i>

05:34.880 --> 05:36.836
Sergeant.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.155
Here.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.916
- See you. Bye!
- Bye.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.716
<i>Waste of time keeping them out here.</i>

07:35.840 --> 07:38.673
They wouldn't know Christmas
from Pancake Tuesday.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.519
Maybe it frightens him,
knowing we're here.

07:41.640 --> 07:45.918
We've got him so frightened
Bloody paralytic.

07:50.320 --> 07:54.074
How many kids has he had?
Three of them, and not a bloody smell.

07:54.200 --> 07:59.399
We've got the bugger so frightened,
he'll make it four before the week's out.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.516
I had a chat with Kenny James.

10:02.640 --> 10:06.792
Waste of time talking to Kenny.
It's not his line of country, young kids.

10:06.920 --> 10:10.629
Flashes a bit maybe. Having them off?
Never in a million years.

10:10.760 --> 10:14.150
- It doesn't hurt, talking to him.
- You must be bloody desperate.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.556
- On the house, Mr Johnson.
- We'll pay.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.636
My turn.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.038
- It's a while since I saw Kenny.
- He's been away.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.549
- Not bloody long enough.
- Sergeant.

10:29.680 --> 10:34.390
- Yes, lad. What is it?
- There's another kiddie missing.

10:34.520 --> 10:37.080
He's so bloody frightened

10:59.200 --> 11:01.873
Most days, the girl walks home
across this common.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.912
Seems likely she did today.
No reason why she shouldn't.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.635
- No reason we know about.
- The parents are not able to help.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.796
Where were they when she left school?

11:10.920 --> 11:13.514
She left school with two of her friends.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.996
- They went home with their mothers.
- Never bloody learn.

11:17.120 --> 11:20.999
- Janie walked towards the common.
- Nobody tried to stop her?

11:21.120 --> 11:23.998
- "Come home with us"?
- Can we get on with this?

11:24.120 --> 11:28.033
- The longer we stay here talking...
- Do we know what she looks like?

11:35.720 --> 11:39.554
Frank, doesn't she look like the
Corder kid, the first one he got hold of?

11:39.680 --> 11:42.592
- I don't think so.
- Looks to me like they could be sisters.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.871
She was an only child.
Spent a lot of time on her own.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.675
- Too bloody much.
- Any questions?

11:51.280 --> 11:53.316
Right, let's get on.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.034
All right.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.720
It's all right.
I don't want to hurt you.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.830
Over here!

15:20.680 --> 15:22.716
No, no.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.990
No! Go away!

15:26.120 --> 15:28.111
No!

15:28.240 --> 15:30.674
- It's all right. Shh!
- No!

15:30.800 --> 15:32.711
No, no, no. Janie.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.628
Janie, don't. It's all right. Shh! Shh!

15:36.760 --> 15:39.354
No, Janie. Please, no.
No. No, no.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.836
Shh.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.713
Janie. Shh.

16:01.640 --> 16:05.110
Yes. No, no, no, no.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.955
All right.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.036
That's it.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.357
All right?

17:06.960 --> 17:09.269
Make a way, men.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.387
Make a line, men. Stand back.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.077
Johnny!

17:42.520 --> 17:44.476
<i>No, no, no!</i>

17:44.600 --> 17:47.433
<i>Shh, shh, shh. OK.</i>

17:47.560 --> 17:50.597
No! No. No, please.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.631
No! No!

17:53.720 --> 17:56.393
- Where are you going?
- Maybe she'll talk.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.317
She's in no state!

17:58.440 --> 18:02.718
Once they get her into hospital,
you won't get near her.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.035
Wait for me.
I'll send someone with you.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.913
Policewoman, would you go along?

18:28.480 --> 18:30.550
Don't, please! No. You won't hurt me?

18:30.680 --> 18:35.470
I won't hurt you, Janie.
I don't want to hurt you.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.591
Well, it does hurt.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.590
<i>It does hurt!</i>

18:41.720 --> 18:45.474
Do you have to? Can't you wait?
Give us a chance.

20:14.360 --> 20:18.194
Sergeant, Mr Lawson says
you should get back to the station.

20:18.320 --> 20:21.835
<i>- He wants to see you.
- The kid is here.</i>

20:31.000 --> 20:36.279
<i>...go immediately
to the incident control room.</i>

20:36.400 --> 20:40.188
<i>Constables on standby,
go to the parade room...</i>

20:40.320 --> 20:45.110
Well, this man approached the girl.
He seemed to be a long way away.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.276
And then...

20:49.680 --> 20:52.717
What's this?
You saw the girl with this man?

20:52.840 --> 20:55.513
- That's right...
- When did you see them?

20:55.640 --> 20:57.710
- Tea time...
- Bloody hours ago!

20:57.840 --> 21:02.914
- The chief inspector's waiting!
- Where the hell have you been?

21:09.360 --> 21:12.352
- "Where the hell have you been?"
- Does she expect a reward?

21:12.480 --> 21:15.153
Coming in here bloody hours late!

21:15.280 --> 21:18.875
- Can she tell us what he looks like?
- Not exactly, no.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.309
- Bloody good sort of lead
- Hey!

21:21.440 --> 21:23.954
What?

21:26.080 --> 21:28.036
Next.

21:30.480 --> 21:34.553
All right. Is she gonna come up with
something better than this?

21:34.680 --> 21:36.636
It doesn't look very promising, sir.

21:36.760 --> 21:40.196
Any luck with the girl at the hospital,
Sergeant Johnson?

21:40.320 --> 21:41.992
No, sir.

21:42.120 --> 21:45.635
The coat is the best lead.
Puts him up a peg.

21:45.760 --> 21:49.912
You won't find your average layabout
in a coat like she's describing.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.996
No, sir. You won't.

21:52.120 --> 21:55.715
- Put you in mind of somebody?
- No, sir. Not immediately.

21:55.840 --> 22:01.437
That's not like you. Usually rely on you
to come up with something.

22:01.560 --> 22:05.633
Like you say, it's a whole different
kind of fella we've been looking for.

22:05.760 --> 22:10.470
You've no business looking out for some
particular kind of fella. You know that.

22:10.600 --> 22:14.434
You have to reckon it could be anybody
until we know for certain who it is.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.915
Tonight I want you out, all of you,

22:17.040 --> 22:20.077
talking to every likely villain
you can lay your hands on.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.919
People you've already talked to,
talk to them again.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.315
Find yourselves some new faces.

22:25.440 --> 22:28.557
He's out in the open.
He's taking chances.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.319
We'll get him. It's a matter of time.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.396
- Mr Cameron.
- Sir?

22:33.520 --> 22:37.035
- I'm going to the hospital. Keep in touch.
- Right.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.069
I want this bugger now,

22:41.200 --> 22:44.510
before he takes some other kid
into the woods and cuts her throat,

22:44.640 --> 22:47.438
like some sort of bloody encore.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.110
OK, sonny.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.877
Billy?

24:13.280 --> 24:15.635
Hang about.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.270
I've been talking to some people
who know you, Billy.

24:21.400 --> 24:24.233
Asking a couple of questions.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.918
You've moved, Billy, haven't you?

24:30.040 --> 24:32.349
I don't know what you mean,
Mr Johnson.

24:32.480 --> 24:37.156
Well, the last time we talked,
didn't you tell me York Street,

24:37.280 --> 24:40.078
you were living on York Street?

24:40.200 --> 24:43.636
- Did I?
- You know bloody well you did.

24:46.840 --> 24:49.354
- Give us a chip.
- I'm taking them home.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.550
Surely you can spare a couple of chips?!

24:51.680 --> 24:55.355
C- couldn't we get into your car?
If my friends see me...

24:55.480 --> 24:57.869
You've...

24:58.000 --> 24:59.956
got no bloody friends.

25:24.680 --> 25:27.558
Look at that.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.828
Everything all right, sir?

27:02.720 --> 27:05.234
Anything I can do to help?

27:07.440 --> 27:10.273
What is it? What's the matter?

28:24.400 --> 28:25.276
This way, sir.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.756
- How does it look?
- I wouldn't bet on it.

29:21.880 --> 29:24.952
- You wouldn't bet on bloody God.
- Not a betting man.

29:25.080 --> 29:30.108
- Cheerful, aren't you?!
- One of my lads brought him in.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.154
Now, I'm just trying to help you.

29:44.200 --> 29:50.116
You say that you were at the cinema.
You know what time the cinema closes.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.913
- Is it him?
- I don't know. Seems likely it is.

29:54.040 --> 29:57.237
- Bloody Cameron. Have you had a go?
- He's saying nothing.

29:57.360 --> 30:01.035
Barely told us his name -
Kenneth Baxter.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.116
- Do we know him?
- No.

30:03.240 --> 30:07.438
- I'll have a go.
- Cameron was asking where were you.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.677
Tell us what you were doing, walking...

30:13.720 --> 30:17.952
Baxter, you have to admit,
it looks a bit odd in the circumstances.

30:18.080 --> 30:21.311
- The constable finding you...
- We're trying to be fair.

30:21.440 --> 30:24.716
If you won't help us, won't even try...

30:24.840 --> 30:28.913
I... I don't know how
I'm supposed to help you, sir.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.190
I don't even know what all this is about.

30:31.320 --> 30:36.599
- You bloody know, Baxter.
- No, no. I don't know.

30:36.720 --> 30:39.109
Please, you have to believe me.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.434
I... I don't know.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.795
I don't know. I don't know.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.632
We'll wait for the chief inspector.

30:51.760 --> 30:56.709
Maybe he can make you understand,
it does no good refusing to talk.

30:56.840 --> 31:00.389
I've told you. I haven't refused.
I've answered your questions.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.590
You won't listen.

31:02.720 --> 31:06.190
How can I help
if you won't even listen? Huh?

31:19.600 --> 31:24.276
<i>Why...
Why won't they listen?</i>

31:24.400 --> 31:27.597
- Are you married?
- Yeah. Yes.

31:28.960 --> 31:31.793
- Got any children?
- Yes.

31:31.920 --> 31:36.357
They'll be worrying -
why aren't you home yet?

31:46.600 --> 31:49.433
- Is it him?
- 60-40 is my bet. Frank?

31:49.560 --> 31:53.439
- Hundred bloody per cent.
- What do you say?

31:53.560 --> 31:56.120
- It seems likely.
- That's him.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.800
Come on, Johnny. You can't know.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.876
I bloody know.

32:02.240 --> 32:06.074
Time was, I'd take your word.
Just now, don't know.

32:06.200 --> 32:11.228
Even you can make mistakes these days.
We'll leave him sweat.

32:13.600 --> 32:17.639
Sweating! He's not sweating.

32:17.760 --> 32:21.150
Laughing! That's him.
Bloody laughing!

33:43.240 --> 33:45.117
- Off you go.
- Sir...

33:45.240 --> 33:48.516
Off you go! I'll take responsibility.

33:59.120 --> 34:02.510
- Brought you a cup of tea.
- I've got nothing to say.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.871
Thought you might be feeling thirsty.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.596
- I won't talk to anybody.
- You don't have to talk. Not to me.

34:10.719 --> 34:14.110
Just thought you might fancy
a cup of tea.

34:17.360 --> 34:20.670
You've no right keeping me here,
no right at all.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.074
People talking to you,
worrying at you.

34:23.199 --> 34:25.998
- Just leave me alone.
- All the time, questions.

34:26.120 --> 34:29.715
- Please, let me sit here, huh?
- Bearing down on you.

34:29.840 --> 34:34.118
- I've got nothing more to say.
- Leaves the throat a bit dry.

34:34.239 --> 34:37.152
Go away, please. Leave me alone.

34:38.840 --> 34:41.478
We can't leave you alone, can we?

34:45.239 --> 34:47.356
Thank you, Sergeant.

34:53.920 --> 34:57.515
- I'd be grateful...
- Cameron, I want to talk to you.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.915
I'll call you back.

35:00.040 --> 35:03.077
I'll read you, Baxter,
like an open book.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.919
I'll read you page by page.

35:06.040 --> 35:09.112
It's here. It's written in your face.

35:09.240 --> 35:13.870
Lines, shadows,
marks on your immortal soul.

35:15.680 --> 35:18.035
Your eyes?

35:19.360 --> 35:24.070
I'll look into your eyes and tell you
everything about Kenneth Baxter.

35:24.200 --> 35:27.670
He didn't say anything, sir,
as long as I was with him.

35:27.800 --> 35:31.315
- He's said precious little since.
- You talked to him?

35:31.440 --> 35:33.954
- Yes, I did.
- Couldn't wait.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.351
- All right, Garrett. Good work.
- Thank you, sir.

35:41.800 --> 35:46.954
- Thought you'd get a quick confession.
- I thought it best. Keep him warm.

35:47.120 --> 35:50.999
If he's the bugger we're after,
he's warm enough. Who else had a go?

35:51.120 --> 35:55.557
- Frank was with me.
- Oh, Jessard. Where was Johnny?

35:55.680 --> 35:58.433
He came in a bit later.

35:58.560 --> 36:02.951
A regular tea party! Did you send out
invitations? Come one, come all?

36:03.080 --> 36:06.277
What sort of an inquiry is this?
It's bloody serious.

36:06.400 --> 36:10.996
- Yes. Yes, of course.
- I'm beginning to bloody wonder.

36:11.120 --> 36:13.031
- Who's with him now?
- No one.

36:13.160 --> 36:17.199
Vaughan, keeping an eye on him.
I've told him not to talk to him.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.595
I hope he takes note.

36:21.040 --> 36:26.034
- You want to charge him?
- No. I'd rather, you know, wait.

36:26.160 --> 36:29.550
We have to charge him now or let him go.
Do you want to let him go?

36:29.680 --> 36:32.911
- No.
- Well, make up your bloody mind!

36:33.960 --> 36:36.793
- Has he talked to his solicitor?
- No.

36:36.920 --> 36:40.708
- He knows he can.
- He's been cautioned.

36:40.840 --> 36:44.071
We'll leave him to think for half an hour,
then I'll have a go.

36:44.200 --> 36:49.194
If he doesn't cough and he has got
a solicitor, we'll have to let him go.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.596
We can't keep him sitting there
all night, can we?

36:52.720 --> 36:56.429
You sad sorry little man.

37:02.560 --> 37:06.633
I'm not playing games with you, Baxter.

37:06.760 --> 37:09.479
I'm not playing games.

37:10.480 --> 37:15.554
Now, you were seen with the girl,
Janie Edmonds, this afternoon.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.837
The other children...

37:19.960 --> 37:23.669
In the morning we'll talk to the other
children concerned in the attacks.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.837
They all described the man clearly.

37:26.960 --> 37:29.349
Quite clearly.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.678
Go on!

37:39.800 --> 37:43.076
Right couple 'ere.
Found them on the common.

37:43.200 --> 37:46.510
- Garrett, you still here?
- Talking to Mr Lawson.

37:46.640 --> 37:50.519
You've got early turn. Get home, lad.
You're no good to us half asleep.

37:50.640 --> 37:53.837
Knocking this fella off?
Ought to be good for a commendation.

37:53.960 --> 37:58.476
If it's the right fella, and they remember
who brought him in. Don't bet on it.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.716
Your names, please...

38:00.840 --> 38:04.674
<i>- Please give your location, over.
- The north side of the square.</i>

38:15.280 --> 38:20.400
<i>No, no! For Christ's sake!</i>

38:22.960 --> 38:25.474
Stand on your own bloody feet.

38:26.960 --> 38:31.476
If I let you go, you'll find yourself
flat on your bloody back!

38:31.600 --> 38:34.876
<i>Bit of a bloody change - flat on your back!</i>

38:44.280 --> 38:45.599
It's all right.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.150
Get an ambulance.

39:19.480 --> 39:23.268
<i>...Davies, Cunningham and
O'Connell, report to the station office.</i>

39:23.400 --> 39:27.518
<i>Detective Sergeant Jessard, report to
the detective chief inspector's office.</i>

39:27.640 --> 39:31.428
<i>The detective constable on standby,
report to Detective Inspector Cameron.</i>

39:31.560 --> 39:33.630
<i>Constables Turner, Davies...</i>

39:33.760 --> 39:36.069
- Sergeant Johnson?
- Hm?

39:39.240 --> 39:41.549
Come along.

40:01.040 --> 40:04.555
- I'll type up my report.
- There's no need.

40:04.680 --> 40:08.639
- It's easily read.
- I'll type it.

40:08.800 --> 40:12.475
There's no way you can keep him alive
by writing about it.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.589
If he's going to die...

40:15.720 --> 40:19.269
Sergeant Johnson,
you are suspended from duty.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.960
Any such period of suspension
may be reckoned

40:22.080 --> 40:25.390
in calculating
your entitlement to pension.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.034
Let me have your warrant card.

40:32.560 --> 40:36.109
- Go to your home now and remain there.
- Sir.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.037
Report back here,
ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.990
Thank you, Mr Cameron.
I'll take that.

40:44.120 --> 40:46.076
That's all.

46:35.600 --> 46:37.113
Johnny!

46:54.320 --> 46:56.311
What are you doing?

47:00.120 --> 47:01.712
Johnny!

47:03.240 --> 47:07.153
I had an accident.
Broke your bloody china lady.

47:29.280 --> 47:32.397
- You're drunk.
- Not yet.

47:32.520 --> 47:36.559
- I don't know why you come home.
- I keep trying.

48:14.560 --> 48:18.758
- I'll let you get on with it.
- Why don't you stop?!

48:18.880 --> 48:21.269
Will you leave the bloody coat?!

48:22.560 --> 48:28.476
It's possible, see, just possible
that I've killed a man tonight.

48:33.080 --> 48:37.517
Frank's gone with him to the hospital.
You know Frank, Frank Jessard?

48:37.640 --> 48:41.155
- Yes.
- Somebody had to go with the bloke.

48:41.280 --> 48:43.840
Frank went.

48:45.800 --> 48:48.598
Who is he?

48:48.720 --> 48:50.756
He'll be all right.

48:50.880 --> 48:53.872
- I hardly touched him.
- Johnny!

48:54.000 --> 48:58.039
You look such a mess, you know that?
Such a bloody mess!

48:58.160 --> 49:01.232
- Look at you! What happened to you?
- What?

49:01.360 --> 49:04.033
You never used to be a mess.
You didn't used to wear...

49:04.160 --> 49:06.549
- It's warm.
- It bloody well should be.

49:06.680 --> 49:12.277
Looks like an electric blanket tied
with rope. Do something about it!

49:14.200 --> 49:16.156
A bloody mess!

49:18.600 --> 49:21.034
You're no bloody oil painting yourself!

49:22.120 --> 49:24.714
No, I'm not.

49:45.800 --> 49:48.155
- Tell me about it.
- He got what he deserved.

49:48.280 --> 49:50.396
What did you do?

49:50.520 --> 49:53.273
I hit him. I don't deny it.

49:53.400 --> 49:57.075
Something they all understand,
sweetie, pain.

49:58.640 --> 50:01.074
I've seen it. I know.

50:02.120 --> 50:04.588
You can't talk to them.
They laugh in your face.

50:04.720 --> 50:08.190
I mean, what are they?
Little better than animals.

50:08.320 --> 50:10.914
Any man would understand pain.

50:11.040 --> 50:15.477
- You hurt them, they'll tell you anything.
- Johnny, for pity's sake!

50:42.680 --> 50:44.591
I know.

50:44.720 --> 50:47.154
You... didn't kill him?

50:48.320 --> 50:50.880
Well, he's in the hospital.

50:52.520 --> 50:58.038
- Johnny, love. Don't!
- He had another kiddie, just today.

50:58.160 --> 51:01.072
- Oh, no.
- Janie.

51:01.200 --> 51:03.270
Her name's Janie.

51:03.400 --> 51:05.516
Janie what?

51:05.640 --> 51:07.790
Edmonds. You know her?

51:07.920 --> 51:09.717
No.

51:10.880 --> 51:13.952
She was almost naked
when I found her.

51:15.840 --> 51:19.230
- Did he...?
- Oh, yes.

51:19.360 --> 51:22.079
She's in the hospital -
the same hospital.

51:22.200 --> 51:25.556
- She'll be all right?
- She'll be all right?

51:25.680 --> 51:29.673
Janie will be all right.
She'll be fine. Right as ninepence.

51:29.800 --> 51:33.998
In a couple of days you won't know
the difference. As good as new.

51:34.120 --> 51:37.271
Isn't that something
to be grateful for?

51:38.320 --> 51:42.916
Just, she isn't new, good as new.
She can't be, not again.

51:43.040 --> 51:46.476
He's... He's been there.
He's had her.

51:46.600 --> 51:48.989
- What's the matter?
- She's alive.

51:49.120 --> 51:52.157
But she could be dead.
I've seen them dead.

51:52.280 --> 51:56.751
Remember? The bloke nearly tore her
in half. What was her name?

51:56.880 --> 51:58.996
Er... Dark hair.

52:01.280 --> 52:03.874
I can see her and I can't...

52:07.120 --> 52:09.475
I can't keep everything here.

52:10.760 --> 52:13.479
All the...

52:13.600 --> 52:16.876
all the people, the things and the death.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.355
Bodies.

52:19.480 --> 52:24.349
Stinking, swollen, black, putrid,
and the smell of death.

52:30.040 --> 52:33.669
White, shattered, splintered bones.

52:35.240 --> 52:38.630
Filthy, swarming, slimy maggots.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.676
In my mind.

52:43.800 --> 52:46.234
Eating my mind.

53:01.360 --> 53:04.238
It's not possible.

53:04.360 --> 53:06.476
Not on my own.

53:10.840 --> 53:12.956
You don't... have to.

53:14.240 --> 53:17.118
Johnny, you're not on your own.

53:17.240 --> 53:19.151
I'm... here.

53:19.280 --> 53:23.193
<i>Please, let me. I can help.
Talk to me.</i>

53:23.320 --> 53:28.713
- I don't want to.
- You must talk to someone, if it'll help.

53:28.840 --> 53:32.071
Why aren't you beautiful?

53:32.200 --> 53:35.033
You're not even pretty.

53:42.800 --> 53:44.916
I never was.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.996
When we got married?

53:47.120 --> 53:50.078
Oh, you said I...

53:50.200 --> 53:54.591
I hoped, for your sake.
I didn't really think so.

53:55.640 --> 53:59.110
Why? Is it important?
Would it help?

54:00.680 --> 54:05.117
I wanted something. I don't know, I...

54:05.240 --> 54:10.837
thought there would be, or should be,
something more, you know?

54:10.960 --> 54:14.032
- Oh, yes.
- I thought it was you.

54:14.160 --> 54:16.276
And I'm not even pretty.

54:16.400 --> 54:17.879
No.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.195
I'm sorry.

54:24.360 --> 54:28.512
The more I drink, it's funny,
the more sober I get.

54:45.760 --> 54:49.878
- Johnny? Talk to me.
- I don't want to talk to you.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.073
- I never have. I made a point of it.
- Who will you talk to?

54:54.200 --> 54:56.760
- Not like some I can mention.
- You stop, you start.

54:56.880 --> 54:59.235
- Chief inspector, for instance.
- Talk to me.

54:59.360 --> 55:03.194
Regular black museum he's got,
in his own front living room.

55:03.320 --> 55:06.437
- "Mementos of my famous cases. "
- You shout, you scream!

55:06.560 --> 55:09.597
- I laughed, but he meant it.
- What else is there?

55:09.720 --> 55:14.032
We could go to bed!
That's no good. We never talk in bed.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.879
A couple of minutes at best,
then off to sleep.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.788
Half the time
I don't think you're there at all.

55:28.480 --> 55:30.550
All right.

55:32.680 --> 55:35.513
You wouldn't... choose me,

55:35.680 --> 55:38.752
choose to talk to me,

55:38.880 --> 55:40.950
but I'm here.

55:41.080 --> 55:43.753
I'll listen.

55:43.880 --> 55:46.235
I want...

55:46.360 --> 55:49.636
Please, I want to help.

55:50.960 --> 55:52.916
I can help.

55:57.320 --> 56:01.154
If you could put your hands
into my mind,

56:01.280 --> 56:04.397
hold it, make it stop.

56:04.520 --> 56:06.556
Tell it, "Stop!"

56:07.320 --> 56:13.429
If you could somehow
cut out the thoughts,

56:13.560 --> 56:16.632
the pictures, the noise,

56:16.760 --> 56:22.392
the endless screaming panic.

56:24.200 --> 56:29.433
If you could make silence,
peace, stop.

56:29.560 --> 56:32.154
Oh, if you could...

56:39.480 --> 56:41.471
Talk to me.

56:46.840 --> 56:50.389
A man without a face.

56:50.520 --> 56:53.239
Burnt away, his face - acid.

56:55.080 --> 56:57.275
They tied him to a chair.

56:57.400 --> 57:01.234
He knew, they thought he knew,
something to do with money.

57:01.360 --> 57:04.113
I don't remember.

57:04.240 --> 57:09.758
He was in this room. He had no face.
I didn't know what to do.

57:09.880 --> 57:14.908
I- I didn't know how to make it stop,
the pain, the screaming.

57:15.040 --> 57:17.349
I didn't know.

57:19.160 --> 57:23.233
Red on white... Timmy Miles.

57:23.360 --> 57:28.354
The man had a thin willow cane,
Timmy told us, for naughty boys.

57:28.480 --> 57:32.314
But if Timmy was a good boy,
did what the man told him to do...

57:32.440 --> 57:36.353
Filthy, obscene things,
the man told him.

57:36.480 --> 57:38.710
Things...

57:38.840 --> 57:43.038
He was well spoken,
posh, Timmy thought.

57:43.160 --> 57:46.277
Eight years old,
blue eyes, fair hair cut short.

57:46.400 --> 57:50.473
Fresh complexion, school blazer -
badge on the breast pocket, grey.

57:50.600 --> 57:54.036
Grey trousers, white shirt,
school tie.

57:54.160 --> 57:56.754
Timmy was missing for three days.

57:56.880 --> 57:59.519
The man had him for three days.

58:02.040 --> 58:05.953
She was dead when we found her.
She was dead.

58:06.080 --> 58:09.277
The wheels of the train
had cut one leg off above the knee.

58:09.400 --> 58:12.597
It was still there when we arrived,
beside the line.

58:12.720 --> 58:17.510
The girl was half a mile away.
She crawled after the train had cut...

58:17.640 --> 58:21.952
God knows where she was going.
She didn't get there.

58:22.080 --> 58:26.551
Of course, she wanted to die,
so that was all right.

58:28.080 --> 58:31.675
The girl, she was dead.

58:31.800 --> 58:35.759
She went through the windscreen.
The bloke got the steering wheel.

58:35.880 --> 58:40.112
He was up climbing after the cat.
The railings were there when he fell.

58:40.240 --> 58:42.515
The bloke didn't know
what he was doing.

58:42.640 --> 58:47.031
Used too much jelly on the safe, painted
the walls with his mates and himself.

58:47.160 --> 58:50.869
The girl was pregnant.
And she wasn't married.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.709
Didn't have anyone,
you know, to talk to?

58:54.840 --> 58:58.753
She went into the woods,
deep into this wood...

59:00.520 --> 59:02.909
and hanged herself.

59:03.040 --> 59:06.874
That was in the winter -
November, they reckon, some time.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.833
We cut her down in March.

59:11.720 --> 59:16.840
Running down streets, back alleys.
Standing in doorways, dark corners.

59:16.960 --> 59:19.269
Always night, no one there.

59:20.320 --> 59:23.630
Silent, empty, people dying.

59:23.760 --> 59:26.354
No one. Bloody dying.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.471
No one.

59:28.600 --> 59:30.830
Oh, I've seen it.

59:33.480 --> 59:36.199
Three weeks in the water.

59:36.320 --> 59:39.949
Hung up on a branch.
Hidden under a bush.

59:40.080 --> 59:44.119
There wasn't a lot left. You could tell
it was a baby, but not much else.

59:44.240 --> 59:49.109
Couldn't leave it there,
leave it to rot, go on rotting.

59:54.400 --> 59:57.472
We fished it out.

59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.194
No sweat, no fuss about the job.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.073
Finding things people have lost,
thrown away.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.112
Sick?

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.037
Sorry, love. Sorry I did that to you.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:30.598
Bloody unfair. No reason you should
have to hear things like that.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.632
- I asked you to tell me.
- You can't tell people.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.716
They just don't understand.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:40.038
- Tonight was the first time.
- Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.038
It won't happen again.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.037
Don't!

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.277
Please! Don't be nice to me!

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.551
- It's my job.
- Don't push me away, shut me out!

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.875
It's a job you do on your own.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.753
- Let me help you.
- Look, sweetie. Enough's enough.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.519
- Just go to bed.
- Please let me help you!

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.710
Help? Help? Help?

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.958
Endless bloody bleating,
like a sheep with a spike stuck up it?!

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.119
I don't need your help.
Your help, or anyone's help!

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.073
You had your chance.
"Talk to me," you said.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.236
All you had to do was listen.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.638
You couldn't even do that,
just hold that bloody belly just listening.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.314
- Unfair.
- "Talk to me," you said.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.433
"I'll help you," you said. It's all promises
with you, bloody promises.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:29.358
"I'll make you happy," you said.
You bloody didn't!

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.832
I'm here to tell you, Miss Bride of 1956,
you didn't make me happy!

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.633
<i>You never have, never once.</i>

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:41.117
If only you'd enjoyed it,
looked up at me, wanted me.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.556
Him!

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.873
Him? Is it him you want?
Some sort of bloody pervert?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.913
Would he make you happy?
Would you say "yes, please" to him?

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.635
Is that why he laughed?

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.110
I hope he's dead.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.236
I wanted him dead.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.635
I thought, "You bastard! Right!"

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.955
So I hit him low in the gut,
and he shook.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:20.438
He won't do that again. He won't take
any more girls in the bushes, have them.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:25.190
Looking down on their bodies,
white bodies, pressing down on them.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.757
I thought if I had a knife, I'd cut him.
In God's holy name, I'd cut! Cut!

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.830
Can we come in?

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.714
Oh, I'm... sorry, Mrs Johnson.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.400
I... I didn't realise.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.514
Baxter?

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.508
He died in hospital.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.632
You'll have to come back to the station.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.592
Now.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.836
Right away.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.349
Yes.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.472
Can I, er...? Have I time?

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.160
Yes. All right.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:22.678
You'd better sit down.
Might have to wait a while.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:34.873
<i>Yes. Probably going
to Beckenham with a prisoner, over.</i>

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.310
<i>Romeo Zero, are you receiving?</i>

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.000
<i>The other unit, repeat.</i>

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.115
Detective Superintendent Cartwright.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.674
Detective Sergeant Johnson.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:12.109
Sit down. Sit down.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.151
Have we ever worked together, Johnson?

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.078
No, sir. Not directly.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.909
- How do you mean?
- I was on the McKinlock murder inquiry.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.474
Oh, yes. Of course. I remember.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.478
I was on door-to-door.
You were in charge of my section.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.558
Thought I knew the face.
Couldn't remember the name.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.319
- Well, you know what this is all about.
- Yes, sir.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.752
The deputy chief constable has
instructed me to conduct an inquiry into...

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:40.997
There's no necessity, man. Sit down.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:47.712
...an inquiry into the events
and death of Kenneth Baxter.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:52.231
How would you like to start? Tell me
how it happened in your own words?

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:56.239
- As much as you can remember.
- You know what happened.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:00.399
- I want you to tell me.
- You've been told. They've told you.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.476
I read the report.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.956
You want to compare
what I've got to say?

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.913
I don't like this, Johnson,
any more than you do.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.871
I don't like it.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.912
All I'm interested in now
is a preliminary talk,

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.076
fill in some of the background.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.078
We'll keep no record of anything said,
unless you feel...

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.749
- No, sir.
- I have to listen to your story.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.429
- I'm sorry.
- There's no necessity to apologise.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.314
- I'm sorry you have to listen.
- All right, let's have it difficult.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:34.513
<i>- Makes no difference to me.
- Well, it is difficult.</i>

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.389
Sir!

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.828
<i>It is difficult, sir.</i>

01:08:44.439 --> 01:08:46.395
Yes, sir.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.268
I have to find out what happened.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:54.837
I've no opinion. It's just, I have
to find something like the truth.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:00.080
<i>- I'll tell you the truth.
- What you tell me is the truth.</i>

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.191
In this case, the only truth.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.988
You talked to Baxter.
What did you hope to achieve?

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:12.877
I thought talking, him and I alone together,
I thought I might reach him.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.310
- Anyone else talk to him?
- They got nothing.

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:20.671
The more people talked, the more time
went by, the happier he got.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.792
The inspector wanted
to leave him on his own to think.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.274
- You didn't agree?
- He wanted to be left alone.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:28.908
In your opinion.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.919
You meet him, Baxter,
he's normal enough.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.917
<i>Seems normal enough.</i>

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.191
You wouldn't think twice -
solid, respectable.

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:40.515
People know him, like him.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:45.270
Inside that man, the man laughing
at you, inside is the other man.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:50.234
The man who fancies schoolgirls. Right?
One hundred per cent right.

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:55.150
When we brought him in, he was covered
in mud. Blood on his trousers. His hands...

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.392
His mind was crawling
with pictures of that girl.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.751
All he could see,
her naked body covered in mud.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:13.917
- I got a hold of him.
- Think what you're saying, man.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.469
Think about it.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:21.116
I understand your feelings,
case like this.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.629
Sit down, man.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.238
Sit down.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.273
- I don't smoke.
- Wise, very wise. Filthy habit.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.188
Did you say how long you've served?

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.914
20 years, sir, almost to the day.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.316
Made detective sergeant ten years ago.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.274
- First likely candidate Baxter.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.914
Pretty pleased
when you pulled him in.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.158
Evidence, identification, confession,
everyone goes home laughing.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.748
Everyone except Baxter.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.519
Difficult beggar.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:06.031
- Didn't bother me.
- Something bothers you.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:09.789
- What?
- Something about Baxter.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.593
No.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.234
- Pretty sure he was the man?
- Yes.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:18.716
- Instinct?
- I've seen his sort before.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.559
No, not Baxter.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.433
You've never had Baxter in before.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.473
No.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.079
- Any past history?
- Not that I know.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:40.149
- Has it been checked?
- Nothing around here.

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.271
Nothing anywhere.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:46.473
You know so bloody much,
what's the point in asking me?

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.154
Have you worked on
cases like this one before?

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.191
Hundred, two hundred.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:57.836
- What's special about this one?
- Special? Nothing.

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.757
It's about a man attacking children.

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.916
Girls.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.996
Opening their bodies.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.032
Savaging them.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.833
Virgin blood. Making them stink!

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.837
Nothing!

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.916
You've read the report!

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.154
Yes, I've read the report.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.676
Read worse things, too.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.756
Seen them.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.157
- You don't know for certain he did it.
- He did it.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:01.034
You don't know!
I am not going to argue with you.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.628
- You can't know.
- I talked to him.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.911
- You were there?
- There was blood on his clothes.

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.033
- Even so, unless you saw him...
- His hands were covered in mud.

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:15.676
...watched him assault the girl,
criminally assault...

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.631
Yes! All right!

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.432
Ah! No!

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.429
You can't know,
in the sense we use the word.

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:28.119
Forget that and where are you?

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:36.152
What's to stop you knowing
I raped the girl?

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:41.912
What's to stop me knowing you
deliberately, unlawfully and maliciously

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.996
beat Kenneth Baxter to death?

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:48.477
No, I didn't.
I mean, I was talking to him.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.318
Nothing.

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:53.273
You haven't listened.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.709
- You can't just walk out.
- Walk out?

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.638
- Not listen.
- I'm going nowhere.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.870
- There is more.
- I hope so.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.798
What you've told me so far
doesn't make much of a story.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.834
What's happening to me?

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.315
In God's holy name.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:35.832
I can see...
All I can see are pictures.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:41.353
In my mind, crowding, ten bloody
million pictures, you know?

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.833
Don't you know?

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:52.077
I try to stop them,
keep them somewhere,

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.998
in the dark, at the back of my mind.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:59.350
They won't rest, leave me rest.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.192
All I can see, looking down,

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:08.073
a body, whiteness.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.918
White body.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.315
And him.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.915
Pushing himself, forcing himself.

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.235
She screams and screams.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.555
Pressing down on her,

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.433
tearing into her screaming.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.154
I can see her hands...

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.192
reach up, clutch at his eyes.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.878
I can see...

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.673
All I can see...

01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.875
Johnson?

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.996
If I were blind, deaf...

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.475
I couldn't think.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.592
Come on, man. Pull yourself together.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.793
- Sorry. Sorry, sir.
- Well, there's no necessity.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.312
Things I can't say.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.159
Don't have the words, right words.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.271
Have to find the right bloody words.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.356
Have to tell someone.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.190
Listen...

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.356
I think I can tell you.

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.315
When I... When I hit him...

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:46.590
- Let go! Let go!
- No, listen!

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:51.072
What are you trying to do?
Burnt my bloody hand.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.317
Are you all right, Johnson? Huh?
Give you a hand.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.396
I'm all right.

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.515
- Sorry about that.
- My fault.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:04.428
- Burnt my hand.
- Must've hurt.

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:07.632
Well, yes.
As a matter of fact, it did.

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:34.954
Doesn't do, brooding on...
well, things like that.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.072
- You can't spend your life...
- How do you stop?

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:43.638
- Keep some part of yourself separate.
- Don't take them home with you?

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:47.634
End of the day, shut them away,
lock the drawer.

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.197
- The day never bloody ends.
- You've got to accept you're two people.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.629
- You're lucky, aren't you?
- A police officer.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.752
- Bloody lucky.
- And the bloke you are off duty.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:03.079
<i>- With your wife, your kids.
- That's how you do it.</i>

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:07.512
- Everyone finds their own way.
- Because you're lucky.

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:11.792
Or is it because you don't have to dig
them out of their dirt graves any more?

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:15.276
Send your inspector, your sergeant,
just don't go yourself.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.551
That's enough, Johnson.
That's more than enough.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.636
Who do you bloody think you are?

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:25.515
I've been soft with you, but there's
a limit, and you just got there.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.552
You're the only one
gets the dirty jobs, are you?

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:33.834
You get special privilege because you
get your share of blood on the walls?

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.155
No bloody more than anyone else!

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:41.752
I don't know what went on in that room.
I come here and I want to be fair.

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.758
- In God's holy name.
- From the bloody word go!

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.872
You don't wanna be fair.
I know what you want.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.436
- Shout and swear from the word go!
- Least said, soonest mended.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.553
You won't help me.
Won't help your bloody self either.

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:58.752
- No one will help me!
- Shut up!

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.912
Bloody shut up and listen to me.

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:07.795
You want everyone to carry on the way
you do, I'll bully you bloody sick.

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.911
You think you're a hard case?

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:14.431
I was shouting and swearing when you
still wet your bed. I'm not proud of it.

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:18.917
I don't look back and think whatever
it is you think, shouting at me.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:22.311
I don't have to impress people,
shouting, I've got the rank.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:26.911
If I want to bully some bloke,
I tell him I'm detective superintendent.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:31.079
That frightens him. He knows the sort
of man is made detective superintendent.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:35.398
The man that stays detective sergeant,
running errands, shouting, swearing,

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:39.433
you know that sort of man, Johnson.
You've seen him. You.

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:42.074
Detective sergeant all your life.

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:53.117
<i>One thing... You're right about one thing.
I don't want to be fair.</i>

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:59.310
I came here because I was told to come.
I was told I had to talk to you.

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:04.639
I don't want to talk to you.
I don't want to waste ten seconds on you.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:08.594
It makes me sick, Johnson,
what you did.

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:12.518
What you are turns my stomach.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.796
Going to help me?

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:30.676
Something like this,
I know it happens. We all know.

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:51.353
Help me.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:03.000
I'll talk to them.

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:07.828
- You will?
- Can't promise anything.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:11.077
You'll make him understand?

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.839
I can't promise they'll listen.

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.836
Make him forgive?

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.314
No reason why they should.

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.314
Sorry I burnt your hand.

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:36.480
- There's no necessity...
- None at all. It was your own fault.

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.110
All the same...

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.310
I didn't tell him.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:56.073
- Brought you a cup of tea.
- I got nothing to say.

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:04.110
You don't have to talk to me.
You don't have to talk to anyone.

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:07.118
Just, don't you think
it would help matters if you did?

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.629
- No.
- I don't want the story of your life.

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.718
- God, I've got troubles of my own.
- I've told you...

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:19.439
Just one thing. Where did you go
at 3.30 when you left your office?

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.996
What did you do
till we picked you up at 10.30?

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:27.955
And how did you find yourself wandering
around town at that time of night?

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:30.594
That's three things, I suppose.

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:33.598
Really all part of the one thing.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.757
What happened to you this afternoon?

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.399
I can guess.

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.954
I've been in the force 20 years.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.753
The things I've seen...

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:49.348
You're a married man, right?

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:53.074
Two children. 12, 14- how old?

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:58.149
Er... Linda's 13.
Marion's nearly 16 now.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:01.078
- How long have you been married?
- 18 years.

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.714
That's a long time.

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.037
I've been married 16 years, myself.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:11.631
What I'm saying is, you feel like
a young man inside, where it counts.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:14.752
Doesn't matter what you look like.
It's what you feel, right?

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.030
One hundred per cent right.

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:19.355
Now, when you get into bed,

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.950
you won't feel any different now
than at, what, 25, 30?

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:26.595
I know I don't. Anything
I could do then, I'll do it now.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:28.756
Twice over.

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.112
They're not interested.

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:35.959
Like they're doing you a favour.

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:42.475
- I'm happily... I'm very happily married.
- Of course you are.

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:45.279
We don't have any problems
of that kind.

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.158
No.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:51.990
- Anyway, I've never thought...
- Never thought? What?

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.554
<i>Well, that it... that was so important.</i>

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.359
- There are other things in life.
- Yes.

01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.675
My wife and I agreed a long time ago...

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:05.158
14 years ago. You did say
that your youngest was 13.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.317
I don't see what all this
has got to do with it.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.396
What do you do with it?

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.954
- Do with what?
- You still fancy a bit.

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.753
- I don't understand.
- You've given it up?

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.270
- I hear the words but...
- You're not getting it at home.

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:22.233
Have you got a mistress,
a fancy woman, a tart

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:26.114
that gives you a cut rate
for regular visits?

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:30.756
<i>- You think you can get away with this...
- Know, Baxter.</i>

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.112
- Bloody know.
- When my solicitor gets here...

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:40.439
Talk for yourself, can't you?
Hiding behind some bloody solicitor.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.269
- What are you frightened of?
- You.

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:47.119
- You've cause enough.
- Yes.

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.029
- Tell me about your wife.
- No.

01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.232
- What sort of woman is she? Past it?
- I won't discuss my wife.

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:04.353
- She's got nothing to do with this.
- Sends you off to bed with a good book?

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:07.199
- Nice hot cup of cocoa...
- I shall report you.

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:10.073
I know the sort of book
you read in bed.

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.839
Shut up, for God's sake, will you?

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.320
What happened to you?

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.673
- You should sit down.
- Take your hands, damn you!

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.712
What is it, Baxter,
about people touching you?

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:37.515
Makes you feel what?
Dirty? Unclean?

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.596
<i>How do you think they feel?</i>

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:45.397
- I won't stay here a minute longer.
- Yes. Oh, yes, you will.

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.636
If I want to touch you,
I'll touch you.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:00.588
We're getting on.
We're making progress.

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:04.916
<i>I'm beginning to know you.</i>

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:09.236
Soon, I'll know what you're thinking.

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.874
I'll read you, Baxter,
like an open book.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.195
I'll read you page by page.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:18.996
It's here. It's written in your face.

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:23.079
Lines and shadows,
marks on your immortal soul.

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:27.716
Your eyes?

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:35.195
I'll look into your eyes and I'll
tell everything about Kenneth Baxter.

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:39.154
I'm watching you, searching you, huh?

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:45.476
My hands, well, they're all over you,
reaching into your secrets.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:49.110
My fingers, probing.
My eyes, feeling.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:52.550
I can tell when you sweat.

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:55.240
I can tell when you shiver.

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.756
You're sweating now.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.715
I'm going to make you see
what you've done.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:18.789
I'm going to make you feel
like that little child felt you.

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:22.912
I'm going to make you feel... pain.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:30.554
You have to feel pain,
pain like she felt, to understand.

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.150
To know,
yes, to know what you've done.

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.396
Pain!

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.117
- Get up.
- Look at it! My hand!

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:54.630
- In God's holy name.
- You've broken it.

01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:58.673
Nothing's broken,
if that's what you're worrying about.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:03.590
- Mad, I think you must be!
- You're the one who's mad, Baxter.

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:06.917
You won't find me chasing girls,
ripping their clothes off.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:12.034
You won't find me following girls home.
"I've got something to show you. "

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.832
I know you.

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.838
Can't get enough at home.
Don't know what to do with it.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.556
Look at your secretary, think about her:
What would she look like stripped off?

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:28.037
You've got money!
Easy when you've got money.

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:35.077
You, I want you. Come here.
Cash on delivery.

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.998
But will you bring it off, huh?

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:42.352
Will you see something in her eyes
that says, "I'll remember you"?

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.994
Suppose she just looks at you.

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.157
And it's just one face,

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:53.829
one more face in ten million others.

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:59.598
Suppose she doesn't even see you!

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.473
You sad sorry little man.

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:41.076
I want to speak to your superior officer.

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:46.510
- You hear what I say?
- The chief inspector is at the hospital.

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:51.156
- I'll speak to the inspector.
- Stay where you are.

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:57.514
- Don't come near me.
- You think you're getting away with this.

01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:02.959
- No, no. Please, no. Don't you...
- You think you're so bloody clever.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:05.594
A man like you,
you make me feel sick.

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:08.433
I'm frightened. Yes, I'm fri...

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:10.596
I'm frightened of you, is that...?

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:14.713
You walk in here like you own the
bloody world, laying down the law.

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:18.071
- You want this, you want that.
- I'll tell you anything.

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:22.318
Walking out again? Different then.

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:26.399
Will I walk out of here?
Will you let me?

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:42.958
In here, in a room like this room,

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:47.471
you find something about yourself.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.034
You won't let me.

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:52.230
Something like the truth.

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:01.235
All my life, men like you!

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:07.829
- Men!
- I want you to show me the truth.

01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:10.793
Men! Women! Boys!

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:18.040
I want you to tell me you're wrong.
"I've done wrong. "

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:25.513
God will punish me, huh?

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:30.760
I've gone all my life,
waiting for God to punish me.

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:35.874
Before you leave this room, Baxter,
you'll be begging me to listen.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.073
<i>Oh, yes. Yes.</i>

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:45.990
Yes.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:55.235
They always go... Thank you.

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:58.750
They always go away, you know.

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:03.510
They always go away.
Ask them and ask them, you know.

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:06.916
Please? Please.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:10.271
There's something they have to do,
they have to think...

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:13.198
And then,

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.470
alone.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.636
Alone.

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:23.519
I've been alone most of my life.
Does that sound strange?

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:25.631
I've got so many friends, you know.

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:30.117
Somehow, I collect friends. People
I've known since school, I still know them.

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.630
I didn't like some of them when
I was at school. That's strange.

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:36.752
- People change when they grow up.
- I don't think so.

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:40.156
Those boys, the men I didn't like,
they haven't changed.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:44.831
One used to bully me. Going to school,
I'd think, "Ooh, he'll be there. "

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:49.476
"He'll make me... " The sort of things
they always make you do.

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:54.435
Fetch them milk. Do their homework.
Eat their pudding.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:58.155
I was sick on the pavement,
I was so afraid.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:08.879
When we... When we went to play games,
he used to watch me changing.

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:13.351
In the showers,
he used to look at me.

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:17.473
He wasn't... you know. I wasn't.

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:24.233
Just, he looked at me like,
"You haven't got much to boast about. "

01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:27.917
- You still see him?
- Every so often.

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:33.637
They have dinner with us. He hasn't done
all that well. Hasn't done as well as I have.

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:37.992
One... One thing I didn't know
when I was at school.

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:41.908
Letting him bully me,
make me fetch and carry for him,

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:46.318
shout at me, laugh,
all made it so he needed me.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:53.436
I... I hated... I hated him.

01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.516
But he needed me.

01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:01.795
He gave me something. He didn't know
he was giving. He thought he had me.

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:07.597
And all the time I was having him.
Don't you think that's strange?

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:09.676
Are you still having him?

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:14.874
I'm still making him pay for every
drop of sweat, every tear, every breath,

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.956
and he still doesn't know.

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:22.874
- That gives you pleasure?
- Why not? He had his pleasure then.

01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:26.553
- Are there many others?
- Yeah.

01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:29.319
Anyone big enough to frighten me,

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:32.273
stupid enough to try.

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.672
<i>Was your father a big man?</i>

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.148
No, no. Really, no.

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:13.272
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- What's so funny?

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.834
No, no, no. Nothing.

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.348
Nothing, no, no.

01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:25.749
Something's bloody funny. It's the
first time I've seen you laugh tonight.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.754
Don't... No, no,
don't hit me, will you?

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.713
<i>You think you're having me?</i>

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:43.830
"Was your father a big man?"

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:47.111
Yes, Doctor.
My father was a big, stupid man.

01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:51.472
My mother dug his grave, dug it deep,
and pushed him into it.

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:58.954
What am I laughing at?

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:00.593
You!

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:02.995
You're pathetic!

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:05.554
I'll pull your head
off your shoulders.

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:07.750
I'll break your legs in half.

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:21.632
Before you shout, think.

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:26.993
Who is there? Who's gonna come, huh?
Who's gonna help?

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:30.669
Your wife?
After we tell her what you've done?

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:33.394
Your children?
Children like Janie Edmonds?

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:35.750
Your friends? What friends?

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:41.238
After they read in the papers
the sort of animal you are.

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:45.958
No one will hear.

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:49.277
No one will come. No one will care.

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.830
You and me in all the world.

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.753
Let go of me.

01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:10.189
You and me. You and me. You and me.

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:12.231
You and me, I know.

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.794
You, you, you.

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:19.038
<i>You, I know you! And I will have you.</i>

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:21.839
- I'll kill you.
- Yes, I know.

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:24.030
Something. You have to do something.

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:27.829
You filthy bloody little pervert.

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:31.350
- Takes one to know one.
- What will you do with that?

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:35.155
Don't know. Seems like a good idea,
holding on to it.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.032
Right. All right.

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:40.038
Don't want to make it easy.
You wouldn't like that.

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.913
- One way or the other.
- The other, any time.

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.113
<i>- Funny bloody man.
- I love you, too.</i>

01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:50.232
Young lad can get hurt,
playing silly games like that.

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:56.196
What would you do then? Means a lot
to you. You talk about nothing else.

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.915
Ah! Like Confucius said...

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:08.510
- No more bloody jokes.
- "Lie back and enjoy it. "

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.790
- Listen!
- You don't even know.

01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:15.072
- One last time.
- What a mess you must be.

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:19.478
- Where were you this afternoon?
- I went to the bloody pictures.

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.039
Make up your mind!
Like a bloody yo-yo, up and down!

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:28.075
Tell me, Baxter!

01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:34.275
Nothing I have done can be one half
as bad as the thoughts in your head.

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:37.358
I wouldn't have your thoughts.

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:51.871
<i>Don't beat me for thoughts in your head,
things you want to do.</i>

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.389
I don't have to tell you anything.

01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:57.592
You know exactly what it's like.

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:03.113
There's nothing I can say
you haven't imagined.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.196
One day...

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:13.669
Oh, you've found it, haven't you? Huh?

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:18.588
Something like the truth, huh?

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:21.433
Does it surprise you?
Does it shock you?

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:25.599
It's there in everyone. You must
know that better than anyone.

01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:28.029
Surely you know, don't you?

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:30.469
Eh?

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:35.192
Of course.

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:41.156
You think just everyone else, not you.
Being a policeman, you have to.

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:43.999
20 years thinking you're different
must be a habit.

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:46.793
"Thank God I'm not as other men!"

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.513
It's... It's difficult.
It's dangerous.

01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:58.474
Cos you're just the same, you see.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:01.239
Some of you, one hell of a lot worse.

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.751
You, for instance.

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.471
Come here.

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:36.990
Oh, no, thanks.

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.076
Come here.

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:52.115
Thoughts in my head.

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:58.393
Now, don't...
You won't hurt me, please?

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:01.398
You know.

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:05.513
<i>I thought, me and no one else.</i>

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:10.955
Help me, if you can.

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:14.675
If you know, and you can tell me.

01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:18.316
Please.

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:23.831
Hasn't always been like now,
like it is all the time.

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:29.319
I can't think,

01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:31.908
can't stop thinking.

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:37.077
Is it... like that?

01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:44.835
Is it the same for you?
Is your mind full of things all the time?

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:48.674
Thoughts.

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.711
Pictures.

01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:53.752
Shadows and darkness.

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.636
White... Smooth white legs.

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.593
Thighs and breasts.

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:07.353
Blood and pain.

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:11.392
You're hurting me.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.036
Help me.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.468
You're hurting me.

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.398
<i>Help me!</i>

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.796
Argh!

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:38.593
Help your bloody self, will you?

01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:59.759
No! Don't! For Christ's sake!

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:14.478
Every single thing I've ever felt,

01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:18.193
wanted to feel,

01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:20.993
in one moment.

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:23.350
Hitting him.

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:28.917
I had to hit him again.

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:32.157
Somehow I...
I didn't have any choice.

01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:41.555
<i>I wanted what he could give me,</i>

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:46.475
sitting there, letting me hit him.

01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:52.473
I wanted that.

01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:55.750
He knew.

01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:00.919
He was saying, like, "Welcome home. "

01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:07.876
I had to kill him.

01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:23.229
Get an ambulance.

01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.910
Oh, God!

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:28.996
Oh, my God!

01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:36.038
