00:02.001 --> 00:03.836
Previously on Lost:

00:03.921 --> 00:05.505
Tequila and tonic.

00:05.589 --> 00:08.591
- Ana Lucia.
- Jack.

00:08.676 --> 00:11.010
We'll have the next drink on the plane,
OK?

00:11.845 --> 00:14.722
- 42F.
- 42F. Right.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.604
All right, all of you get up.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.316
Sawyer!

00:25.401 --> 00:28.361
Help me make a stretcher.
We're gonna carry him.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.447
Walt!

00:33.283 --> 00:35.368
- Walt!
- Shannon!

00:43.043 --> 00:44.877
Shannon!

01:19.037 --> 01:20.747
So, how you doing?

01:21.665 --> 01:24.709
Well, the family
with the screaming baby moved.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.003
Well, you must be thrilled.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.632
Actually, it's too quiet now.

01:37.389 --> 01:40.808
So, how's Danny?
You two trying to work things out?

01:42.394 --> 01:46.189
There's nothing to work out. He left.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.025
You OK with that?

01:49.902 --> 01:54.071
I guess you could say I'm one of those
people who's just better off alone.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.536
- So how was the firing range?
- Good.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.665
How did it feel to hold a gun again?

02:04.750 --> 02:09.086
- Very good.
- All these steps count, Ana.

02:09.170 --> 02:12.215
You've come a long way
since we met four months ago.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.636
She say?

02:17.471 --> 02:21.432
You know, when I can come back to work?

02:23.060 --> 02:25.645
She left the final determination
up to me.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.563
Right.

02:29.942 --> 02:31.901
Do you think you're ready?

02:33.403 --> 02:35.488
What do you think?

02:55.467 --> 02:57.885
Welcome back to the force,
Officer Cortez.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.612
Sayid! Sayid, no!

03:19.950 --> 03:22.034
- He's one of us!
- No!

03:23.453 --> 03:25.037
Let go!

03:30.919 --> 03:32.420
Stop! Stop!

03:33.463 --> 03:34.839
Let go!

03:44.224 --> 03:46.475
Hey! Hey!

03:46.560 --> 03:48.936
Don't move! Nobody move!

04:18.132 --> 04:20.301
Nobody move! Nobody!

04:22.387 --> 04:24.555
Does he have anything else on him?

04:25.432 --> 04:28.184
- What?
- He just had a gun to your neck.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.188
Check to see if he has
anything else on him.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.940
- Hey, put it down.
- Stop.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.192
- Don't point that at me.
- I said, stop.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.444
- What is your problem?
- Ana!

04:39.154 --> 04:41.906
Get back! Get back, both of you!

04:42.032 --> 04:43.616
Are you crazy?

04:43.700 --> 04:45.534
- Ana.
- Now!

04:45.619 --> 04:47.328
Ana!

04:49.873 --> 04:52.124
We need to tie him up.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.836
- I'm not tying him up.
- He tried to kill you.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.548
No.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.897
You. You do it.

05:18.527 --> 05:21.153
Tie him.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.782
- Use the vines from the stretcher.
- If we take that thing apart,

05:24.866 --> 05:26.784
- we won't be able to...
- Shut up!

05:26.868 --> 05:30.413
Ana, Sawyer needs a doctor,
or he'll die.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.000
I know what I'm doing.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.848
I hope this is all of it.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.267
- That's all we've got right now.
- OK.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.186
Thanks, Captain.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.400
Come on in.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.281
Hey, look who's here. Good to see you,
Ana Lucia. Welcome back.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.949
Thanks, Raggs.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.326
I'll, get you those IRs, Captain.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.495
- Today.
- You've got it.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.792
How are you?

06:16.877 --> 06:19.253
Good. Fine.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.463
Good.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.300
Your assignment.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.056
Evidence?
You're putting me behind a desk?

06:30.140 --> 06:32.516
- That a problem?
- I want patrol.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.394
- I don't care what you want.
- Just put me in a car.

06:35.479 --> 06:38.773
You were in an
officer-involved shooting. No.

06:51.453 --> 06:52.828
Both.

06:57.209 --> 07:00.795
I need to be back on the street. Please.

07:04.049 --> 07:07.802
I put you in a car,
everyone's gonna know I pulled strings.

07:07.886 --> 07:11.722
You don't want me to treat you
like my daughter? Don't ask for favors.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.849
Then transfer me.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.356
You don't get the transfer,
but I'll give you the car.

07:25.112 --> 07:29.156
- Happy?
- Sorry to bother you, Captain.

07:29.241 --> 07:32.451
Ana, there's a call for you.
They say it's real important.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.870
Thanks, Raggs, I'll be right there.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.416
They got you a cake.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.294
Try and act surprised.

07:55.517 --> 07:59.812
Jack, nice to see you out of the hatch.
You could use more sunshine.

08:00.730 --> 08:04.859
- I'll take that under advisement.
- Little fruit might do you good, too.

08:04.943 --> 08:08.362
Good for the constitution.
Least that's what they say.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.073
Well, if that's what they say.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.580
Where did you get these?

08:17.664 --> 08:21.083
Just 'cause you're excited,
don't talk with your mouth full.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.931
Past the hanging tree,
double or nothing.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.058
You sure?

08:38.143 --> 08:40.561
There's no way
you're hitting it that far.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.938
Hurley, the woman's on bloody steroids.

08:43.565 --> 08:44.857
Double's 10,000 bucks.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.526
That's nothing to someone
worth $150 million.

08:47.611 --> 08:50.029
He'll build you your own course.

08:50.113 --> 08:53.407
- What's he talking about?
- Ignore him, he's an idiot.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.287
Crap!

08:59.289 --> 09:01.373
You hooked it.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.376
Try keeping your left arm straight.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.630
You're giving me tips?

09:09.090 --> 09:11.717
Kate. I'm a doctor.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.346
So you think you could do better?

09:17.140 --> 09:19.600
Anyone can hit a ball. That's not golf.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.561
And what's golf?

09:23.563 --> 09:26.232
Golf is accuracy.

09:29.736 --> 09:35.157
Well, why don't we play a few holes and
see which one of us is more accurate?

09:36.368 --> 09:38.244
Fighting talk.

09:40.664 --> 09:43.958
- You're kidding, right?
- Three holes. No handicap.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.168
We play for bragging rights.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.963
What are we waiting for?

09:57.514 --> 10:00.683
Ana, let's just get to their camp.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.060
It was an accident. They'll understand.

10:03.186 --> 10:06.522
They'll understand?
I killed one of them.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.533
Those two move, shout.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.535
Wait. What are you doing?

10:22.706 --> 10:24.581
Untie me.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.127
- I'm not...
- Untie me!

10:28.962 --> 10:30.504
Ana.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.635
What are you doing?

10:37.804 --> 10:40.055
I'm taking him back to his camp.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.807
Don't leave.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.477
Please.
If that were you, he'd let you die.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.646
I am not doing it for him.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.525
I am doing it for me.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.743
1 -Adam-7, assault with a deadly weapon

11:00.827 --> 11:05.039
convenience store on Alvarado and
Reservoir. Please respond, code three.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.624
So, that shrink give you any good drugs?

11:08.877 --> 11:11.837
Not that kind of shrink.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.381
- Did you miss me?
- Boy, did I.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.761
I heard about you and Danny.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.473
Want me to go kick his ass for you?

11:23.266 --> 11:25.976
Nah, it's better this way.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.900
What are we doing in Westwood?

11:32.984 --> 11:35.569
Thought a change of scenery
would be nice.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.947
Nice, safe neighborhood
for your first day back.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.162
- This was her idea, wasn't it?
- She is the captain.

11:46.081 --> 11:50.584
8-Adam-9. Please respond to a domestic
disturbance call, 2210 south Veteran.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.254
This is 8-Adam-16.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.215
- That's not our call.
- Go ahead.

11:56.299 --> 12:00.469
We're just three blocks away
from that call on Veteran. We got it.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.763
Copy that, 8-Adam-16.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.895
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

12:09.979 --> 12:13.565
Not the TV, Travis! The TV is mine!
You bring that back!

12:13.650 --> 12:15.943
- I bought it with my money!
- Liar!

12:16.653 --> 12:18.695
- Did you call the cops?
- What?

12:18.822 --> 12:20.989
Do something useful, Shawna, shut up!

12:21.074 --> 12:24.743
- Arrest him! He's stealing my TV!
- She hit me! She hit me!

12:24.828 --> 12:27.496
- Hey! Enough! Both of you.
- Shut that kid up!

12:27.622 --> 12:30.666
What are you gonna do? Hit me again?
Hit the baby?

12:31.334 --> 12:32.960
Shut that kid up!

12:34.504 --> 12:37.256
- Both of you!
- Put your hands where I can see them!

12:37.340 --> 12:40.926
- Get down on the ground!
- All right.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.929
- Officer Cortez!
- Ma'am, get your baby upstairs.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.973
- Ana Lucia!
- Hands on the ground!

12:46.057 --> 12:48.225
Ana Lucia!

12:48.351 --> 12:51.061
- It's all right! OK, OK!
- He is down.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.816
- I'm down! I'm down!
- Holster your weapon.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.027
Now.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.914
Hey.

13:13.376 --> 13:16.170
- I think you should let him go.
- No.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.631
- He's gonna come after me.
- You don't know that.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.010
I killed someone he loves.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.776
Sit down. Now.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.739
I'm bringing him water.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.784
You wanna shoot me? Shoot me.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.168
Don't even think of untying him.

14:09.807 --> 14:12.059
Who is that woman?

14:13.311 --> 14:15.395
Her name is Ana Lucia.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.399
She was on the plane. Tail section.
They all were.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.779
- We were bringing them back.
- Where is Walt?

14:26.324 --> 14:28.408
They took him.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.827
The Others.

14:33.790 --> 14:38.460
- What do you mean they took him?
- From the raft. The night we left.

14:42.924 --> 14:44.466
Hey, man...

14:47.929 --> 14:50.180
Hey, we're gonna get out of this, man.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.818
- Guess you're first.
- Lucky me.

15:06.155 --> 15:09.491
The ladies' tee at my club back home
is ten feet closer...

15:09.617 --> 15:10.659
Shut up, Jack.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.385
Nice.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.345
You're up.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.155
Wow.

15:48.865 --> 15:51.199
You really put it in there.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.831
We have more balls.
You can take a drop.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.000
I'm good.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.965
Got it.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.356
You may wanna move.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.110
What?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.956
Where is the doctor?

16:49.092 --> 16:51.176
I got him. I got him.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.679
- Where we headed?
- Bathroom.

16:56.849 --> 17:01.019
He's burning up. We've gotta get him in
the shower and bring this fever down.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.938
What can I do?

17:05.273 --> 17:09.944
OK, go through the medical stash,
there's a bottle of ofloxacin.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.239
- Ofloxacin.
- Little white pills.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.782
Bring the alcohol
and some gauze patches,

17:14.867 --> 17:18.662
then strip that bed and make sure
it's got clean sheets on it.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.708
- Kate!
- Yeah, yeah.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.260
What happened?

17:34.637 --> 17:36.930
John, the button.

18:04.959 --> 18:10.589
Hello.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.853
Hey.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.107
What are we doing here, Ana?

18:29.859 --> 18:32.444
I mean, their camp has gotta be close.

18:33.905 --> 18:36.156
I just want to get back to my wife.

18:39.243 --> 18:42.204
How long have I kept you alive out here,
Bernard?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.124
That's right.

18:47.043 --> 18:50.212
- So cut me some slack.
- Hey.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.257
We just want to know what you're doing.
What's the plan?

18:54.383 --> 18:56.426
She has no plan.

18:57.178 --> 19:00.222
She only has her guilt and a gun.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.060
You want a plan?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.816
Do you have any ammo
back at your camp?

19:10.900 --> 19:13.151
- What?
- Ammo, for the gun.

19:13.236 --> 19:15.445
Do you have any, back at your camp?

19:15.571 --> 19:19.324
- Yeah, a couple boxes.
- All right. I want it.

19:19.408 --> 19:23.495
At least half.
And I'll need a pack, a big one.

19:23.579 --> 19:28.542
A blanket, some medicine, clothes,
jeans and socks.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.086
- You getting all this?
- I got it.

19:31.212 --> 19:33.380
All right.

19:33.464 --> 19:37.801
You bring all of that stuff back to me,
and I'll let your friend go.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.931
- I'm not leaving them.
- Michael, you should.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.141
- No. We stay together.
- Go.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.573
I'll be back, man.

20:00.116 --> 20:03.201
Ana, what are you doing?

20:04.829 --> 20:07.289
You can't live out here alone.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.459
I'm already alone.

20:34.525 --> 20:36.401
I'll sign us out.

20:36.485 --> 20:40.113
- What, you're talking to me now?
- I just wanna go home, AL.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.074
Hey, I ordered that guy to stop twice.

20:43.159 --> 20:46.328
So every time we run into some yoyo
with a TV in his hands

20:46.454 --> 20:49.331
- you're gonna draw down?
- Hey, Ana Lucia.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.208
Your guy? We got him.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.635
His name is Jason McCormack.

21:01.719 --> 21:05.430
We picked him up on an assault
on an elderly woman in Echo Park.

21:05.514 --> 21:09.935
His fingerprints matched a partial
from your crime scene. He confessed.

21:10.019 --> 21:13.605
The DA's ready to file charges.
All he needs is for you to ID him.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.196
- It's not him.
- He confessed.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.992
- I don't know him.
- Can you guys give us a minute?

21:34.961 --> 21:38.004
- Why are you doing this?
- Because it's not him.

21:39.256 --> 21:43.051
He put four bullets into you.
Hollow points through your vest.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.387
He tried to kill you.

21:47.473 --> 21:51.017
You want a list of his priors?
You want him back out on the street?

21:55.898 --> 21:58.024
It's not him.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.949
What happened?

22:49.285 --> 22:51.619
Out there, what happened?

22:55.291 --> 22:58.793
- There was an accident.
- What kind of accident?

22:58.878 --> 23:01.546
A girl was shot... and killed.

23:06.343 --> 23:10.972
- What did she look like?
- She was tall, with blonde hair.

23:13.684 --> 23:16.102
- There was an Arab man.
- Shannon.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.948
There were five of you
from the tail section?

23:29.033 --> 23:30.241
Four.

23:30.326 --> 23:33.912
Why didn't the rest of them come
back with you? And Michael, Jin...

23:33.996 --> 23:36.331
They cannot come back right now.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.044
Can you take me to them?

23:48.803 --> 23:50.220
No.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.723
Here you go.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.852
What's happening?
Why is he shaking?

23:57.937 --> 24:02.524
He's septic. The infection's
gotten into the blood stream.

24:02.608 --> 24:06.486
If the antibiotics don't bring the fever
down, he'll go into shock.

24:07.905 --> 24:10.031
Hold him up.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.373
OK, I got him.

24:24.547 --> 24:26.548
No, swallow it, swallow it.

24:26.632 --> 24:29.134
- Damn it.
- Here, I'll do it.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.427
- No, no, I got it.
- I can do it.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.228
Sawyer.

24:42.606 --> 24:44.774
It's Kate.

24:47.403 --> 24:49.904
You need to listen to me, OK?

24:52.074 --> 24:55.952
The only way that you are going
to get better is if you take this pill.

24:58.622 --> 25:01.124
So I need you to swallow it, OK?

25:05.963 --> 25:08.047
OK, here we go.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.848
Now swallow.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.683
Swallow.

25:18.767 --> 25:21.269
Good, good. That's good.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.109
Nice job.

25:29.111 --> 25:32.947
We didn't learn the "whisper-in-the-ear"
thing in med school.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.550
What are you doing?

25:52.635 --> 25:56.763
I'm going, Ana.
I don't want to be a part of this.

25:59.516 --> 26:02.727
I know everything you've done for us.

26:02.811 --> 26:06.189
And I wouldn't even be alive
if it weren't for you.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.441
But I'm going.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.696
What about you?

26:14.490 --> 26:17.909
I just don't think
you're the best judge of character.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.746
I was with you
when you put Nathan in the pit.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.960
All right.

26:28.963 --> 26:31.673
You wanna go? Go.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.010
Leave.

26:36.679 --> 26:39.389
You, go.

26:46.188 --> 26:48.273
Get out of here.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.693
Go.

27:46.749 --> 27:48.833
Michael!

27:51.420 --> 27:55.131
Listen. It's all right. Jin is OK.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.175
What happened? Where is he?

27:57.259 --> 27:59.552
He's fine. And I'll explain.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.847
But right now I need to find Jack.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.771
Where are they?

28:15.527 --> 28:18.237
I said where are they?

28:18.322 --> 28:21.240
- Jack, it's not his...
- Shannon's dead! I'm not...

28:27.373 --> 28:29.957
You're gonna take me back out there.
Right now.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.543
He isn't the problem.
He brought Sawyer back.

28:32.628 --> 28:35.838
Half dead with a bullet hole
in his shoulder, John!

28:39.593 --> 28:42.637
Are you gonna talk to me,
or are you just gonna sit there?

28:44.139 --> 28:47.183
Anything I say will only make you angry.

28:51.605 --> 28:54.774
So yes, I will sit here.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.111
Jack!

29:05.452 --> 29:07.161
Michael.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.832
We got a problem, man.

29:17.381 --> 29:19.841
- Remember how to get out there?
- I think so.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.009
We should stop and think about this.

29:22.136 --> 29:26.097
Think about what, John? Shannon's dead.
Sayid's being held at gunpoint.

29:26.181 --> 29:30.893
You want to sit here and hope that
situation resolves itself, be my guest.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.313
- You know how to use this?
- Guess so.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.108
Stop!

29:39.445 --> 29:41.320
Please.

29:43.657 --> 29:46.117
What do you want?

29:46.201 --> 29:50.371
- Excuse me?
- Peace, revenge, justice?

29:50.456 --> 29:52.790
And you are going out
with all these guns.

29:54.168 --> 29:57.253
- What do you want?
- All of our people back here safely.

29:57.337 --> 30:00.715
- Your friend...
- Ana Lucia made a mistake.

30:02.676 --> 30:04.635
What did you say?

30:05.471 --> 30:07.805
Ana Lucia made a mistake.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.978
Ana Lucia?

30:23.906 --> 30:26.073
I will take you there.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.576
But only you.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.370
And no guns.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.257
Let's go.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.682
Where you from?

31:00.776 --> 31:03.277
Where are you from?

31:05.656 --> 31:07.782
I'm from Iraq.

31:11.161 --> 31:13.246
You have any kids?

31:16.458 --> 31:18.709
Why are you asking me
if I have children?

31:18.794 --> 31:22.922
- I'm curious.
- I do not. Do you have children?

31:24.299 --> 31:25.716
No.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.927
Are you going to kill me?

31:30.389 --> 31:32.848
That's what you're thinking about,
isn't it?

31:33.517 --> 31:35.601
Should I?

31:39.398 --> 31:41.899
Almost 40 days ago on this very island,

31:44.111 --> 31:46.862
I tied a man to a tree
and I tortured him.

31:49.324 --> 31:52.159
I tortured him as I tortured many men.

31:54.288 --> 31:57.331
Men whose voices
I still hear in the night.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.629
Should you kill me?

32:05.340 --> 32:07.466
Maybe you should.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.804
Maybe you are meant to.

32:27.029 --> 32:29.238
I'm a cop.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.703
I was a cop.

32:37.372 --> 32:41.667
One night, my partner and I
responded to a burglary call.

32:42.919 --> 32:47.632
We were the first ones there. I covered
the front and he went around the back.

32:52.929 --> 32:58.434
I was there a minute, then this kid
comes right through the front door.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.270
I tell him to put his hands up.

33:01.938 --> 33:04.231
And he says I'm making a mistake.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.276
That he's a student.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.905
And he wants to show me his ID.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.743
I believed him.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.913
I just...

33:21.500 --> 33:23.584
I let him reach.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.465
All I remember was a pop.

33:29.925 --> 33:33.094
By the time I hit the ground
I thought I was dead.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.892
I feel dead.

33:45.232 --> 33:48.734
What happened to him?
The man who shot you?

34:00.997 --> 34:02.957
- Oh, yeah!
- Who's up next?

34:04.292 --> 34:06.585
- Way to go!
- Catch you later, man. See ya!

34:06.670 --> 34:08.670
Yeah, on the flip.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.821
Hey.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.322
Jason.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.502
I know you?

34:51.172 --> 34:53.340
I was pregnant.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.027
What happened to him?

35:22.370 --> 35:25.164
Nothing. They never found him.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.570
Go ahead.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.158
Pick it up.

36:02.911 --> 36:04.995
I deserve it.

36:14.089 --> 36:17.091
What good would it be to kill you...

36:18.552 --> 36:20.719
if we're both already dead?

37:21.323 --> 37:22.823
Hey.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.951
Hey, can you hear me?

37:30.332 --> 37:32.625
You're gonna be OK.

37:35.837 --> 37:38.380
You're gonna be all right.

37:40.133 --> 37:42.176
You're home.
