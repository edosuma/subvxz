{\pos(192,230)}Cover the eye that we didn't treat.
What do you see?

00:05.669 --> 00:08.127
- Nothing.
- Gonna get your optic nerves to grow.

00:09.390 --> 00:11.463
I don't know if that eye
can take another procedure.

00:11.725 --> 00:14.504
- We could do the other eye.
- And risk going blind in both of them?

00:14.770 --> 00:16.175
{\pos(192,230)}They looked everywhere.

00:16.446 --> 00:18.262
Looks like one living,
10 dead, 13 missing.

00:18.532 --> 00:21.932
We need NorBAC to answer 3 questions.
Is this outbreak contagious?

00:22.194 --> 00:24.343
What's the cause?
And is it safe to evacuate?

00:24.503 --> 00:26.381
What happened to your crew?

00:27.995 --> 00:30.149
- I don't know.
- What kind of cargo?

00:30.417 --> 00:33.444
It's coltan. It's used in cell phones,
TVs, DVD players.

00:33.706 --> 00:35.571
They unloaded all this stuff in Miami?

00:35.833 --> 00:39.543
1.3 million kilos onboard,
now being dispersed on trucks.

00:39.703 --> 00:42.953
I found the remnants of an insect's skin
under the fingernail scrapings.

00:43.215 --> 00:46.999
We might have a variant
on the Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever.

00:47.261 --> 00:49.126
CCHF is tick-borne. No ticks were found.

00:49.541 --> 00:52.046
- Are they tick wounds?
- I don't know what these are.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.813
- That's not good.
- No.

00:55.658 --> 00:58.037
- Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever?
- A variant.

00:58.397 --> 01:00.581
- What kind?
- It killed a boatload of sailors

01:00.741 --> 01:03.371
and it doesn't respond
to Ribavirin <i>in vitro.</i>

01:04.720 --> 01:07.102
Okay. I need to talk
with my tropical medicine people.

01:07.743 --> 01:10.105
- Hey.
- Hey. How is he?

01:10.367 --> 01:13.580
He's not presenting any symptoms yet.
I cut 3 maggots out of him.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.653
Oh, nice. Any idea about the species?

01:15.813 --> 01:18.548
I did a quick database check.
But so many of them look alike.

01:18.708 --> 01:20.704
- U of T entomology?
- I sent them over.

01:20.864 --> 01:21.872
Okay.

01:23.817 --> 01:26.208
Any books you've been wanting to read?

01:28.235 --> 01:30.532
They should be putting me
on hemodynamic support,

01:30.804 --> 01:33.619
ECG, monitoring fluid balances,
electrolyte levels...

01:33.779 --> 01:35.469
I'll make sure it's all taken care of.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.770
- We'll test the blood and the insect.
- Just try to relax.

01:41.347 --> 01:44.230
So how'd he get bitten?
He was wearing a hazmat suit.

01:45.613 --> 01:47.559
Maybe above deck before he put it on.

01:49.387 --> 01:51.754
Fuck, there's another one! Watch out!

01:53.160 --> 01:55.818
- What was he doing up there?
- Take pictures and let's get out.

01:56.251 --> 01:58.757
Check his suit
when you get back to the lab.

01:58.917 --> 01:59.971
Yeah, okay.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.435
{\pos(150,258)}Could you take
a look at it for me?

Hell!

05:16.720 --> 05:17.603
<i>I don't know.</i>

05:17.868 --> 05:20.689
Juice out of the wall is clean.
Power supply is ticking.

05:20.951 --> 05:23.189
Well, what... I mean, what is it then?

05:23.576 --> 05:25.994
- Could it be a virus maybe?
- I don't think so.

05:26.154 --> 05:28.662
- I enhanced our firewall last month.
- That explains it.

05:29.607 --> 05:31.744
Rachel called
and asked about Carlos's blood.

05:31.904 --> 05:34.388
I sent the data to the UHN.
They're going to run it for me.

05:34.673 --> 05:38.113
Look, do you mind if I use your computer
to run some research on these maggots?

05:38.273 --> 05:40.453
No, as long as you don't kill it.

05:40.695 --> 05:42.988
She's a bit of a Dr. Kevorkian
with computers around here.

05:43.148 --> 05:43.877
Funny.

05:44.037 --> 05:47.460
I knew a girl blew two computers
in one day. Turned out to be her braces.

06:02.031 --> 06:02.991
David?

06:03.695 --> 06:04.773
Yeah, Bob?

06:04.949 --> 06:07.542
- Thanks for letting me stay here.
- No problem.

06:07.702 --> 06:10.398
- Do you mind if I keep the light on?
- Go for it.

06:11.312 --> 06:13.257
- It's just a habit.
- Sure.

06:15.319 --> 06:16.280
David?

06:17.053 --> 06:17.971
Yeah, Bob.

06:18.131 --> 06:20.897
- I think I lost my toothbrush.
- It's okay. I've got an extra one.

06:23.018 --> 06:23.955
David.

06:24.576 --> 06:25.912
Go to sleep, Bob.

06:26.451 --> 06:28.924
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

06:40.780 --> 06:43.831
Come on, Mayko. How could you have
all those computers go wrong on you?

06:43.991 --> 06:47.811
God, I've had, like, two hours of sleep.
Please don't start on me, too.

06:48.210 --> 06:51.440
- All right, sorry.
- You're lucky, 'cause I have good news.

06:51.708 --> 06:53.436
<i>- It's a botfly maggot.</i>
- Botfly?

06:53.596 --> 06:57.782
This is actually pretty cool. See,
a botfly wants to lay its eggs in you.

06:57.942 --> 07:01.425
But it actually uses another insect
to do the dirty work.

07:01.726 --> 07:06.461
In Africa, it likes to use ticks.
So it lays its eggs on the tick's legs.

07:06.765 --> 07:09.240
- Okay.
- And when the tick lands on a person,

07:09.400 --> 07:11.881
botfly eggs can actually sense
that person's body heat

07:12.041 --> 07:14.270
and this cues the botfly eggs to hatch.

07:14.430 --> 07:16.471
And then out comes this tiny larva.

07:17.009 --> 07:18.853
- What, that fast?
- Yeah, that fast.

07:19.013 --> 07:20.690
So the larva drops off the tick's legs,

07:20.850 --> 07:23.447
onto the person, and then it
burrows under the skin

07:23.607 --> 07:26.023
- where it begins to grow.
- Into a maggot, I get it.

07:26.397 --> 07:27.831
Maggot turns into a boil.

07:27.991 --> 07:31.227
As it grows, the person goes crazy
with itching, scratches off the boil,

07:31.387 --> 07:34.904
out pops a big, juicy maggot.
What about the hemorrhagic fever?

07:35.168 --> 07:38.869
It must have come the old-fashioned way.
From a tick bite.

07:39.131 --> 07:40.742
- In Africa?
<i>- Yeah, in Africa.</i>

07:40.902 --> 07:42.788
<i>Because there were no ticks
on the boat, right?</i>

07:42.948 --> 07:44.958
Right. What about Carlos?

07:45.220 --> 07:47.251
Well, no ticks on the boat so...

07:47.411 --> 07:50.547
the botflies needed some other insect
to transport the eggs.

07:50.809 --> 07:53.012
So it could have been
a good old American housefly?

07:53.172 --> 07:54.761
Plenty of those on board.

07:55.595 --> 07:57.352
What about Carlos's blood work?

07:57.516 --> 07:59.700
I haven't heard back yet,
but I'll ask Rachel{\ when I see her}.

07:59.860 --> 08:01.099
Never mind, I'll do it.

08:01.409 --> 08:03.120
Hey, wait. Where are you?

08:08.179 --> 08:09.164
Rachel.

08:09.703 --> 08:12.168
- Carlos's blood?
- Just got the results.

08:12.328 --> 08:15.918
Oh, and those hazmat suits? Carlos had
a 3-centimeter rip under his left arm.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.531
Big door for a fly.

08:27.354 --> 08:30.379
- This had better be good news.
- No hemorrhagic fever.

08:30.834 --> 08:32.881
Yes! Gracias a Dios.

08:33.143 --> 08:34.383
You were lucky.

08:34.645 --> 08:37.510
- What? I still work for you.
- Nice. Get your ass in here.

08:39.022 --> 08:41.629
- Hey, we have to go. Where's Bob?
- I rode my bike.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.900
- Thought you were picking him up.
- You said you were.

08:44.061 --> 08:45.408
- I didn't.
- You did!

08:45.568 --> 08:48.314
- Let's just go get him.
- You're losing it, SandstrÃ¶m.

08:49.325 --> 08:50.782
How you doing, Bob?

08:50.942 --> 08:53.004
- Just thinking.
- About what?

08:53.217 --> 08:56.196
When we first came to Canada, my mother
kept all the lights off at night.

08:56.648 --> 09:00.492
She and I used to sit in the kitchen
with this little green lamp.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.369
We would read by it...

09:03.246 --> 09:04.629
between us.

09:05.894 --> 09:08.496
I learned English
and then I taught it to her.

09:08.824 --> 09:11.871
- What was your father doing?
- Working, working.

09:12.257 --> 09:14.339
I only ever saw him on weekends.

09:14.739 --> 09:15.924
Bob, are you ready?

09:16.450 --> 09:17.411
Very.

09:17.973 --> 09:19.051
Good luck.

09:21.676 --> 09:23.223
Need you to keep still.

09:24.910 --> 09:27.769
When I got my own apartment,
I took the lamp with me.

09:29.351 --> 09:30.772
I still read by it.

09:33.570 --> 09:35.485
Need you to keep your eyes closed.

09:39.507 --> 09:40.515
Okay.

09:41.265 --> 09:42.242
Hang on there.

09:54.792 --> 09:55.706
Okay.

09:57.065 --> 09:58.050
All right, Bob.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.464
You can open them.

10:08.348 --> 10:09.450
I can see.

10:10.824 --> 10:11.770
A little bit.

10:13.077 --> 10:14.409
I mean, I think it's good.

10:14.875 --> 10:15.965
How good?

10:16.832 --> 10:18.566
Better than before my accident.

10:18.869 --> 10:19.898
I think.

10:22.336 --> 10:23.658
I love your perfume.

10:24.919 --> 10:25.903
Thank you.

10:27.038 --> 10:29.161
- Need you to look at this light here.
- Okay.

10:29.348 --> 10:30.380
Follow it.

10:30.895 --> 10:31.902
Good.

10:32.430 --> 10:34.187
- How's it look?
- Left.

10:37.681 --> 10:39.743
Good, good.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.275
All right. See that chart over there?

10:44.534 --> 10:45.482
Cover your eye.

10:47.972 --> 10:49.392
Can you read it for me?

10:49.870 --> 10:51.581
F, E, L, O, P, Z, D.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.105
That's the seventh line down.

10:55.490 --> 10:56.475
25/20.

11:00.212 --> 11:01.502
I can see, David.

11:09.621 --> 11:11.478
- Are you ready?
- Whenever you are.

11:11.638 --> 11:14.418
- I need to speak to David.
- Hey, how's Bob?

11:14.578 --> 11:16.503
Better than perfect vision
in the treated eye.

11:16.765 --> 11:18.566
- He's doing terrific.
- That's fantastic.

11:18.726 --> 11:21.841
We left him at David's. He needs
to chill and relax. But he's so happy.

11:22.103 --> 11:24.763
- He's calling his relatives.
- What great, great news.

11:24.923 --> 11:27.055
- Mayko, do you have a second?
- I'll see you later.

11:27.464 --> 11:30.372
Oh, David. I just got a call
from the New York Stock Exchange.

11:30.532 --> 11:32.831
They're having problems
with their computers.

11:32.991 --> 11:34.750
- Why us?
- It's been a few weeks

11:34.910 --> 11:38.269
- it's starting to spread.
- Send it to the ATF lab or somewhere.

11:38.429 --> 11:41.503
They did. They sent it to Livermore.
It's covered by an organic slime.

11:41.663 --> 11:43.629
- Like a biofilm?
- Exactly.

11:43.789 --> 11:46.505
- It's all over the main circuit board.
- What kind of biofilm?

11:46.669 --> 11:48.752
I guess that's why
they're calling us in.

11:48.912 --> 11:51.218
Alright.
Have them send it up in a bio-bag.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.158
We got enough computer problems
of our own.

11:53.318 --> 11:55.381
It's already here.
Carlos is looking at it.

11:56.276 --> 11:58.713
Well, thanks for keeping me in the loop.

11:59.674 --> 12:00.799
You're welcome.

12:05.404 --> 12:06.810
Bob's optic nerve.

12:07.115 --> 12:09.131
What we want is for that nerve to grow.

12:09.313 --> 12:12.013
Frankly, we're trying to drive a car
with a brake on.

12:12.173 --> 12:16.326
We produce an siRNA, which
effectively eliminates the brake.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.757
One key will be fine.

12:28.609 --> 12:29.570
Thanks.

12:31.154 --> 12:33.240
You're getting very good at this.

12:57.602 --> 12:58.938
What took you so long?

12:59.828 --> 13:00.742
Traffic.

13:00.952 --> 13:02.567
- How are you, Jonny?
- Good.

13:03.670 --> 13:05.006
I'm good.

13:05.832 --> 13:07.737
Here are your husband's files.

13:08.229 --> 13:10.244
- You have something?
- Yeah.

13:11.254 --> 13:14.707
Yeah. I've got boxes full of dead ends.

13:15.176 --> 13:15.949
What?

13:17.454 --> 13:19.728
I know that this is not
what you wanted to hear.

13:20.988 --> 13:23.697
A month ago, you told me
that everything looked promising.

13:23.965 --> 13:27.523
And every time I was on to something,
suddenly it just curved into darkness.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.869
Your husband, I mean, this guy...

13:30.947 --> 13:33.431
This guy knows how to cover his tracks.

13:33.811 --> 13:35.518
You told me you could uncover them.

13:35.810 --> 13:37.894
I didn't say that I could walk on water.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.438
So you're telling me
that you have nothing?

13:40.700 --> 13:43.694
Nothing that's admissible in court,
nothing that the Justice Department's

13:43.854 --> 13:46.357
- gonna find of any interest.
- What about the Sinatra virus?

13:46.711 --> 13:49.736
I fed you all that dirt that said he was
steering it towards Kay Pharmaceuticals.

13:49.896 --> 13:53.072
You know what they did? They paid
him cash, and cash can be put into...

13:53.338 --> 13:56.221
a gym bag. Cash can be put
into a safety deposit box.

13:56.498 --> 13:58.591
I mean,
maybe he stashed it in the Caymans. I...

13:59.031 --> 13:59.992
Rachel...

14:01.445 --> 14:04.023
I've been doing this for you
for 6 months

14:04.644 --> 14:06.659
and I have found nothing.

14:08.897 --> 14:10.443
What the fuck? I mean...

14:12.389 --> 14:14.146
Turn it over to the FBI.

14:26.096 --> 14:28.065
What the hell is going on?

14:29.739 --> 14:32.276
This is all very exciting,
but we're not out of the woods yet.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.461
We gotta do exactly
what Dr. Turnbull says.

14:34.621 --> 14:37.231
- I can't just sit here.
- Just put on your iPod and zone out.

14:37.391 --> 14:40.306
- Impossible.
- You spend half your time zoned out.

14:41.567 --> 14:43.587
I don't know how to put this nicely,

14:43.747 --> 14:46.421
- but it smells in here.
- I'll open a window.

14:47.018 --> 14:48.845
You'll have to get rid of that couch.

14:49.267 --> 14:50.111
Why?

14:50.275 --> 14:53.303
There are about 50 different kinds
of perfume embedded in the cushions.

14:53.463 --> 14:54.915
- Really.
- David.

14:55.563 --> 14:56.649
I'm underestimating.

14:57.658 --> 15:00.351
You never used to complain
about the perfume on my couch before.

15:00.613 --> 15:04.082
- I guess I have too much time.
- I'll move the couch.

15:04.242 --> 15:05.601
I'll put a cover on it.

15:05.987 --> 15:08.899
But if you cooperate,
I'll cook you something special.

15:09.059 --> 15:11.518
Seafood. I can smell it.

15:12.877 --> 15:13.990
It's in the fridge.

15:14.987 --> 15:17.744
Unidentified 3-day-old crustacean.
No thanks.

15:22.539 --> 15:23.259
What?

15:23.511 --> 15:26.014
David, we have electron microscope
images of the biofilm.

15:26.174 --> 15:26.877
<i>And?</i>

15:27.281 --> 15:29.160
You should take a look at this.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.105
Okay, first thing tomorrow morning.

15:31.265 --> 15:32.884
No, I mean like right now.

15:33.983 --> 15:34.948
Why, what is it?

15:35.108 --> 15:37.305
<i>The bacterium
from the New York Stock Exchange.</i>

15:38.166 --> 15:41.142
- I've never seen anything like this.
- I'll be right in.

15:53.668 --> 15:55.476
What the fuck's going on
with the lights?

15:55.636 --> 15:58.918
Don't know. I was in the middle of doing
an EM scan when the power went down.

15:59.867 --> 16:03.153
- Backup generator kick in okay?
- Yeah, exactly as it should have.

16:03.313 --> 16:04.676
Okay. So.

16:04.836 --> 16:07.511
Here is the surface
of the circuit board.

16:07.671 --> 16:09.877
That's the bacteria
that forms the biofilm?

16:10.044 --> 16:11.617
Take a look at them when we zoom in.

16:14.189 --> 16:16.971
See, they all seem to be oriented
in exactly the same direction.

16:17.091 --> 16:19.232
- Like they're marching in formation.
- Precisely.

16:19.419 --> 16:21.360
Working together
to gum up the circuit board.

16:22.274 --> 16:23.403
As if programmed.

16:23.813 --> 16:27.515
Okay, let's get Rachel back in here,
see if we can identify this crud.

17:31.829 --> 17:32.722
Hey, Bob.

17:33.213 --> 17:34.630
What are you working on?

17:34.750 --> 17:37.007
Ah, some kind of magnetic...

17:38.883 --> 17:42.066
- What are you doing here?
- I'm back. I'm ready for work.

17:42.351 --> 17:44.556
David, I'm fine. I know I am.

17:45.706 --> 17:47.283
I want to have the other eye done.

17:47.403 --> 17:49.713
Okay, hold on a second.

17:49.833 --> 17:52.227
- Let's just make sure that...
- David, I am sure.

17:52.347 --> 17:54.272
Everything has worked perfectly.

17:55.319 --> 17:56.746
I wanna have the other eye done.

17:59.353 --> 18:03.099
- Okay. Welcome back.
- Thank you.

18:03.219 --> 18:05.154
What do you know
about magnetic bacteria?

18:05.274 --> 18:06.808
- Which ones?
- Any ones.

18:06.928 --> 18:09.231
Well, they've only been studied
for a couple of years.

18:09.351 --> 18:12.228
But they're
these very esoteric microorganisms

18:12.348 --> 18:14.681
that align themselves
with the Earth's magnetic field.

18:15.356 --> 18:17.684
Family: <i>Nitrospiraceae</i>,
Genus: <i>Magnetobacterium</i>.

18:17.926 --> 18:20.812
They're gram-negative proteobacteria
that can live in anoxic sediments.

18:21.336 --> 18:22.747
Magnetobacterium?

18:22.867 --> 18:25.399
Yeah. Probably only a handful
of scientists have even seen them.

18:25.519 --> 18:27.894
So we're among the chosen few.
What do they do?

18:28.014 --> 18:30.722
They have magnetosomes inside of them
which are made of iron crystals.

18:30.842 --> 18:32.990
And that's the part
that's attracted to magnetic fields.

18:33.232 --> 18:34.742
The world's smallest compasses?

18:34.984 --> 18:37.453
Capacitors store electrical charges
on circuit boards.

18:37.695 --> 18:40.115
And that charge means
there's also a magnetic field there.

18:40.249 --> 18:42.406
Like lighthouses
sending out a beacon to these things.

18:42.544 --> 18:44.454
They follow the beacon
back to the lighthouse...

18:44.574 --> 18:47.043
- And they burn it down.
- So how are they burning it down?

18:47.163 --> 18:50.341
Well, the bacteria does produce
an extra-cellular polysaccharide.

18:50.583 --> 18:53.410
It's a gluey-like slime
that holds the biofilm together.

18:53.530 --> 18:55.429
The biofilm then coats
the circuit board...

18:55.549 --> 18:57.993
The circuit board short-circuits.
Brilliant.

18:58.113 --> 19:00.643
- There are some troubling details.
- Like what?

19:00.885 --> 19:03.871
Magnetic bacteria can only exist
in an anaerobic environment.

19:03.991 --> 19:05.224
Oxygen kills them.

19:05.544 --> 19:06.941
So they should be dead.

19:08.944 --> 19:11.762
Here's what we do. Rachel, you figure
out how they're surviving in oxygen.

19:11.882 --> 19:15.352
Bob, you figure out what they're eating.
Carlos, Mayko, extermination.

19:16.331 --> 19:19.037
Okay, what the fuck
is going on around here?

19:23.409 --> 19:25.293
Maybe the biofilm
has contaminated NorBAC.

19:28.429 --> 19:29.589
Is that a stupid idea?

19:30.615 --> 19:32.277
Oh, shit.

19:32.397 --> 19:34.761
Everybody back up your hard drives.

19:40.133 --> 19:44.103
Okay, so this is a circuit board that
IT pulled out of your computer, Mayko.

19:44.955 --> 19:47.820
So the circuit boards here at NorBAC and
the ones at the New York Stock Exchange

19:47.940 --> 19:49.980
are both being attacked
by the same magnetobacteria.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.402
But how did it end up here?

19:51.644 --> 19:54.040
Maybe the magnetobacteria
from New York contaminated us?

19:54.160 --> 19:57.158
That's not possible. My computer crashed
before the circuit boards got here.

19:57.342 --> 19:58.649
This is just coincidence?

19:58.818 --> 20:02.493
No, I'd say that more than just Mayko's
computers are infected by now.

20:03.049 --> 20:06.358
I'll get on Maintenance and get them
to change all our circuit boards.

20:06.478 --> 20:09.282
We just need to figure out a connection
between us and the NY Stock Exchange.

20:09.402 --> 20:11.753
Maybe their common supplier,
product, software.

20:11.873 --> 20:14.030
- I'll get on it.
- I need the name of every lab

20:14.150 --> 20:17.525
working with magnetobacteria.
Maybe somebody there can help us.

20:23.586 --> 20:25.603
I should've gone into law.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.748
- David.
- Yeah. We did tests

20:58.002 --> 21:02.014
within the lab. Circuit boards
in the ventilation system... infected.

21:02.256 --> 21:05.893
- There goes my BlackBerry.
- I've got something on how it survives.

21:06.135 --> 21:08.896
A little audiovisual aid.
But we better do it quick.

21:09.353 --> 21:12.274
All right. This is the sequence
of the magnetobacteria's DNA.

21:12.394 --> 21:14.527
This is the area
that controls sensitivity to oxygen.

21:14.769 --> 21:17.466
- Somebody fuck with it?
- They've added superoxide dismutase,

21:17.586 --> 21:21.038
catalase and peroxidase. All the enzymes
needed to survive in oxygen.

21:21.172 --> 21:22.033
Shit.

21:22.153 --> 21:23.619
Who's working on this?

21:23.861 --> 21:27.298
There's 4 U.S. labs:
Cat's Research, New Age Metallurgy,

21:27.418 --> 21:30.251
Northern Sky Laboratories
and KMM Industries.

21:30.493 --> 21:32.797
All of them are above board.
Mayko's contacting them.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.866
- Think I found something interesting.
- What?

21:34.986 --> 21:38.215
I did an analysis on all the substances
found in a capacitor.

21:38.335 --> 21:40.094
The key components, aluminum,

21:40.336 --> 21:43.014
- silicon, copper, gold, mica...
- Just tell me what you got, Bob.

21:43.256 --> 21:44.222
Tantalum.

21:44.742 --> 21:45.600
Tantalum?

21:45.951 --> 21:49.061
- And where do you get tantalum?
- It's refined from ore. Coltan.

21:49.749 --> 21:52.416
What the sailors infected with
that hemorrhagic were hauling.

21:52.536 --> 21:54.025
All roads lead to Africa.

21:54.267 --> 21:57.133
- See? I told you it was interesting.
- 1.3 million kilos

21:57.253 --> 21:58.857
smuggled out of the Congo basin.

21:58.977 --> 22:01.898
Now we got a bug that's attracted
to tantalum capacitors. What the fuck?

22:02.018 --> 22:04.652
I'm gonna keep working on
the magnetobacterium. We gotta kill it.

22:04.772 --> 22:06.625
- I'll help you.
- Wes, you work with Mayko.

22:06.745 --> 22:08.589
Anything on those companies.
Just leave that.

22:08.709 --> 22:10.522
- I wanna take a closer look.
- Sure.

22:15.762 --> 22:16.721
<i>Wes.</i>

22:17.248 --> 22:20.134
- You have a minute?
- Yeah, of course. What do you need?

22:22.879 --> 22:26.210
When you were talking about those labs,
dealing with magnetobacteria,

22:26.330 --> 22:28.207
- something twigged for me.
- What?

22:28.327 --> 22:32.478
Years ago, Carl worked for a drilling
company called Ursa Minor Drilling.

22:32.598 --> 22:34.523
Which I remember
because it's a constellation.

22:34.765 --> 22:38.470
The Little Dipper. But also
because its sister company's name

22:38.590 --> 22:40.446
is a play on where it can be seen.

22:41.301 --> 22:43.705
Northern Sky Laboratories.
Magnetobacteria.

22:43.839 --> 22:48.833
Exactly. So Ursa Minor had retained Carl
as a lobbyist to get permission to drill

22:48.953 --> 22:52.782
in this very environmentally sensitive
area of the Boreal Shield in Manitoba.

22:53.034 --> 22:55.426
I wonder what they were drilling for.

22:57.719 --> 22:58.905
Three guesses.

22:59.090 --> 23:00.508
First two don't count.

23:01.179 --> 23:02.158
Tantalum.

23:09.502 --> 23:12.454
I'm gonna keep working on the
magnetobacterium, see if we can kill it.

23:12.574 --> 23:14.443
- Yeah, I'll help you.
- Wes, work with Mayko.

23:14.563 --> 23:16.424
Anything on those companies.
Just leave that.

23:16.544 --> 23:18.367
- I wanna take a closer look.
- Sure.

23:23.570 --> 23:24.373
<i>Wes.</i>

23:25.024 --> 23:27.910
- You have a minute?
- Yeah, of course. What do you need?

23:29.228 --> 23:30.672
What's up, Bob?

23:30.804 --> 23:31.950
It's Rachel.

23:32.070 --> 23:34.137
- Rachel? What about her?
- She's

23:34.265 --> 23:35.814
scared or excited or...

23:36.709 --> 23:39.057
- something.
- What're you talking about?

23:40.665 --> 23:42.996
When she walked by me,
I could just tell.

23:43.958 --> 23:46.095
Well, we're all pretty
hopped up right now.

24:00.101 --> 24:02.028
We have to bring David in on this.

24:02.270 --> 24:05.948
- And I think it's a bad idea.
- Bad idea to bring me in on what?

24:08.867 --> 24:12.983
Come on, Rachel. You just finished
telling Wes I should get involved, so...

24:13.898 --> 24:15.911
Carl Riddlemeyer on the take?

24:16.262 --> 24:18.731
We think that Riddlemeyer is
siphoning off data from NorBAC

24:18.851 --> 24:21.288
for high-tech firms
and collecting a finder's fee.

24:21.408 --> 24:23.941
- Why am I just hearing about it now?
- We wanted to catch him

24:24.061 --> 24:26.383
with his hand in the cookie jar,
not smack him over the head.

24:26.505 --> 24:27.678
How'd you get onto him?

24:27.927 --> 24:30.829
I knew he was hiding money from me
from when we did the divorce settlement,

24:30.949 --> 24:33.059
- and one thing led to another.
- Who else is in on it?

24:33.301 --> 24:35.945
- That's what we're trying to find out.
- I hired a forensic accountant.

24:36.065 --> 24:37.634
He's been going through Carl's

24:37.754 --> 24:39.654
transactions,
trying to link him to something.

24:39.774 --> 24:42.149
He came up with these leads,
but so far none have panned out.

24:42.269 --> 24:45.523
And then this tantalum thing came up.
And we think Carl may be running a scam

24:45.643 --> 24:47.528
- to manipulate the market.
- Carl doesn't know

24:47.648 --> 24:50.156
we've made the connection, so hopefully
he hasn't covered his tracks.

24:50.276 --> 24:52.326
And the evidence may still be
in these files.

24:57.337 --> 24:58.453
Weston Field.

25:01.026 --> 25:02.206
Yeah, thanks.

25:03.075 --> 25:05.142
Riddlemeyer's flying back
this afternoon.

25:05.262 --> 25:07.925
- Good timing.
- All right, best behaviour, David.

25:08.045 --> 25:11.700
Actually, I think it's time
you threw a match into Carl's gas tank.

25:13.799 --> 25:17.228
This circuit board is from the mainframe
at LAX air traffic control.

25:18.014 --> 25:20.018
Three other major airports were hit.

25:20.138 --> 25:21.894
Philadelphia, Chicago and Seattle.

25:22.014 --> 25:23.988
All of them infected
with magnetobacteria?

25:24.108 --> 25:27.152
If they were,
it represents a major escalation.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.116
Thousands of people were caught midair.

25:30.749 --> 25:33.175
We just narrowly averted a catastrophe.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.914
- Have you found a way to kill it?
- Not just yet.

25:37.741 --> 25:38.602
Well,

25:38.932 --> 25:40.656
how about the way it spread?

25:40.776 --> 25:42.952
That's still unclear as well,
but we're working on it.

25:43.842 --> 25:46.257
Okay, well, who's behind it? Any idea?

25:46.499 --> 25:48.634
Now that is an interesting question.

25:48.876 --> 25:51.720
- You know who it is?
- No. But we have found some clues.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.050
Such as?

25:58.305 --> 26:00.396
Have you ever heard of tantalum?

26:01.112 --> 26:03.597
It's to do with electronics. Capacitors.

26:03.792 --> 26:05.526
So you know
it's a highly prized mineral.

26:06.673 --> 26:09.701
I do have some knowledge
of the mining industry.

26:10.325 --> 26:13.553
Well, the thing is,
tantalum is derived from coltan.

26:14.233 --> 26:16.787
When you check your records,
you'll see we were just dealing

26:16.907 --> 26:19.489
with an outbreak of hemorrhagic
fever onboard a freighter

26:19.609 --> 26:22.664
- that was just loaded with coltan.
- I fail to see the connection.

26:22.784 --> 26:26.987
With all this magnetobacteria running
around fucking up tantalum capacitors,

26:27.107 --> 26:30.759
there's gonna be a panic and the market
for raw coltan is going to skyrocket.

26:31.001 --> 26:34.162
Whoever's sitting on a supply
is looking to make a killing.

26:34.740 --> 26:37.364
That shipment alone
could be worth billions.

26:37.742 --> 26:41.094
And it's out there somewhere,
on a fleet of 18-wheelers.

26:41.689 --> 26:44.305
It's just a matter of time
till we track it down.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.983
Yeah so, to answer your question, no,

26:47.103 --> 26:48.706
we don't know who would

26:48.826 --> 26:51.717
engineer the magnetobacteria yet. But

26:52.273 --> 26:54.491
what we do have is a damn good motive.

26:54.826 --> 26:56.914
- Money.
- Keep me posted.

26:57.404 --> 26:59.788
Sure.
Maybe you could look into this for us.

27:00.030 --> 27:02.416
I mean, get Washington to put
a couple of spooks on it.

27:03.594 --> 27:04.418
Sure.

27:05.913 --> 27:09.227
You know, Carl, whoever is
behind this is a real fuckhead.

27:10.927 --> 27:13.656
He better pray that we can figure out
how to shut this thing down.

27:13.776 --> 27:15.132
Because if we can't,

27:15.252 --> 27:19.380
there won't be a single fucking toy
left for him to spend his billions on.

27:25.191 --> 27:27.942
You don't think I'm a fuckhead,
do you, David?

27:29.512 --> 27:31.195
Of course not, Carl.

27:43.346 --> 27:45.668
I think you're king of the fuckheads.

27:45.910 --> 27:48.657
<i>And to recap our top story,
planes are grounded</i>

27:48.777 --> 27:50.666
<i>in Los Angeles, Chicago,</i>

27:50.799 --> 27:54.009
<i>Philadelphia and Denver
as engineers search for answers</i>

27:54.364 --> 27:57.820
<i>as to what caused
flight navigation systems to crash.</i>

28:00.423 --> 28:02.005
- It's spreading.
- Yeah, I know.

28:02.125 --> 28:04.686
I heard Wall Street
spent millions replacing circuit boards.

28:05.514 --> 28:07.111
- What's wrong?
- What do you mean?

28:07.231 --> 28:08.571
You're frightened.

28:09.425 --> 28:10.824
Yeah, actually.

28:11.363 --> 28:12.659
So what's up?

28:12.991 --> 28:14.029
I don't know.

28:14.603 --> 28:16.115
It's probably none of my business.

28:16.357 --> 28:19.692
Bob, no. I just... I was thinking,
you know, what if these bacteria

28:19.812 --> 28:22.251
got into the mainframe at some nuclear
power station? That's all.

28:22.371 --> 28:24.030
- That is scary.
- Yeah.

28:25.299 --> 28:26.274
And happy?

28:26.536 --> 28:28.507
- What?
- Why are you happy?

28:30.705 --> 28:32.381
I'm just glad you're back.

28:34.369 --> 28:35.622
That's nice.

28:39.370 --> 28:42.632
- Hello, Mr. Riddlemeyer.
- Dr. Melnikov. Dr. Tran.

28:43.834 --> 28:46.890
- He was terrified.
- I didn't get that impression.

28:47.969 --> 28:49.447
It was obvious to me.

28:50.490 --> 28:51.191
Thanks.

28:59.358 --> 29:00.742
We need to talk.

29:01.510 --> 29:04.098
David? That match you threw
into Riddlemeyer's gas tank?

29:04.218 --> 29:06.396
Looks like it just went off. Come on.

29:06.518 --> 29:07.220
See?

29:07.340 --> 29:10.682
- Sometimes it pays to play with fire.
- As close as I can figure,

29:10.802 --> 29:13.672
Riddlemeyer came out of your office, got
into an elevator, placed a phone call.

29:13.914 --> 29:16.856
Really? So the question is did he make
it to somebody who fits into all this?

29:16.976 --> 29:19.081
- Exactly. You remember Kayne?
- Oh, yeah.

29:19.201 --> 29:21.519
You traced those smallpox calls for us.
How you doing?

29:21.639 --> 29:22.877
Good, thanks.

29:22.997 --> 29:25.559
Kayne has tapped into all
of Riddlemeyer's outgoing phone calls.

29:25.801 --> 29:27.478
- Take a look at this.
- Bing-fucking-o.

29:27.962 --> 29:30.445
- What's your next step?
- I'm gonna look at these files.

29:30.565 --> 29:32.105
Rachel's gonna set something up.

29:32.225 --> 29:35.105
Okay. Keep me informed.
And remember, nobody plays hero.

29:40.065 --> 29:41.532
- Got a minute?
- For you?

29:41.652 --> 29:45.369
So I've been in contact with four labs
working with magnetobacteria.

29:45.562 --> 29:48.642
They are forwarding a list of anyone
they think could be considered

29:48.763 --> 29:52.882
- an individual of interest.
- CC Wes anything from Northern Sky.

29:53.154 --> 29:54.191
Wes. Why?

29:54.756 --> 29:56.840
It's need-to-know,
and right now you don't.

29:58.115 --> 29:59.510
Okay, fine.

29:59.752 --> 30:02.170
I'm sorry. Just trust me on this.
I'll explain later.

30:02.290 --> 30:04.932
Anyway, there's something else.
I need to talk to you about Bob.

30:05.174 --> 30:07.184
Have you noticed anything odd
about his behaviour?

30:07.304 --> 30:09.269
- Every time we talk.
- No, I mean

30:09.511 --> 30:11.063
like strange-strange.

30:12.385 --> 30:13.231
Okay.

30:13.365 --> 30:15.675
Bob seemed to know what I was feeling.

30:15.796 --> 30:19.238
- Sounds like love.
- I'm serious. I know it sounds stupid,

30:19.480 --> 30:22.533
- it's like he could read my emotions.
- He has Asperger's,

30:22.775 --> 30:26.370
Mayko. I mean, empathy isn't
something his brain processes.

30:26.954 --> 30:28.395
Maybe it does now.

31:09.123 --> 31:13.096
You'd think all this pizza smell
would silence my nose, but it doesn't.

31:13.509 --> 31:15.594
So, what do you want to tell me?

31:15.886 --> 31:18.045
- Tell you?
- Yeah, you're anxious.

31:18.166 --> 31:20.067
You want to tell me something.

31:20.535 --> 31:21.729
Well, Bob,

31:22.632 --> 31:23.466
okay.

31:25.437 --> 31:26.857
People are talking.

31:27.028 --> 31:28.716
- About what?
- About you.

31:28.847 --> 31:30.842
Me? Why? What are they saying?

31:32.441 --> 31:34.345
They think you're acting differently.

31:34.466 --> 31:36.309
Like you're, I don't know,

31:36.561 --> 31:38.762
more sensitive to their emotions.

31:40.301 --> 31:43.697
Well, I'm finding it a little easier
to understand what people are saying.

31:43.888 --> 31:45.782
And what they're not saying.

31:49.045 --> 31:51.040
I don't know what's going on, David.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.582
All I do know
is that I don't want it to stop.

31:54.668 --> 31:55.607
Yeah...

31:56.822 --> 31:59.867
I think we should go back to Dr Turnbull
and have a little chat with her.

31:59.987 --> 32:01.882
The amazing thing is people, David.

32:02.467 --> 32:05.719
Their faces show one thing,
but there's so much else going on.

32:07.011 --> 32:07.918
See?

32:08.789 --> 32:11.187
Your face suggests that you are happy.

32:11.378 --> 32:13.373
But actually, you are worried.

32:14.903 --> 32:15.901
Don't be.

32:26.607 --> 32:29.068
Okay,
so this is LAX computer's motherboard.

32:29.371 --> 32:32.554
- There's the magnetobacteria.
- Right. No surprise there.

32:33.498 --> 32:36.542
I have a theory about this biofilm
I'd like to bounce off you.

32:36.784 --> 32:38.340
- Fire away.
- Okay.

32:39.076 --> 32:40.379
Dead magnetobacteria.

32:40.621 --> 32:43.016
The cell walls have collapsed
around the magnetosomes.

32:43.136 --> 32:45.364
Some of them were killed
by the agents we introduced.

32:45.484 --> 32:48.268
No. See, that's the thing.
They've actually died

32:48.388 --> 32:51.698
and formed protective layers
on the surface of the biofilm.

32:51.818 --> 32:55.018
You're thinking that they're engineered
to keep reproducing, then the carcasses

32:55.140 --> 32:58.199
form a protective layer, keeping them
from the ultraviolet radiation,

32:58.364 --> 33:00.823
- or whatever we're throwing at them.
- Exactly.

33:00.945 --> 33:04.084
Like soldiers fighting
behind a wall of dead comrades.

33:04.204 --> 33:06.120
This would have to be
part of the engineering.

33:06.241 --> 33:08.388
- How the hell do they do that?
- I don't know,

33:08.508 --> 33:11.675
but the answer has to be down there
somewhere in the genome.

33:16.923 --> 33:18.151
Rachel Woods.

33:19.759 --> 33:20.886
Oh yeah,

33:21.528 --> 33:23.100
thanks for calling back.

33:25.265 --> 33:28.459
I think I might have something.
Maybe we could get together.

33:28.661 --> 33:29.839
No, alone.

33:32.192 --> 33:34.046
Yes, that would be perfect.

33:34.369 --> 33:35.880
Okay, see you soon.

34:00.116 --> 34:03.283
Well. I thought
I was never gonna hear from you again.

34:03.552 --> 34:05.950
Sorry, just cleaning up a few details.

34:06.549 --> 34:08.489
Don't you mean tying up loose ends?

34:08.610 --> 34:09.634
'Scuse me?

34:10.418 --> 34:13.056
I didn't know
you were in touch with Carl.

34:13.888 --> 34:15.868
What makes you think that I am?

34:16.445 --> 34:18.206
Because, you know, it's funny:

34:18.327 --> 34:21.480
every time he leaves a NorBAC meeting,
he's on a call

34:21.722 --> 34:22.626
to you.

34:22.786 --> 34:24.815
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

34:25.529 --> 34:28.152
I think
the two of you are working together.

34:28.684 --> 34:29.516
On what?

34:29.638 --> 34:33.489
Manipulating tantalum futures
on pharmaceutical espionage!

34:33.911 --> 34:36.898
Theft, fraud...
I don't know, Jonny, you tell me.

34:37.380 --> 34:39.581
I can tell you that you're way off base.

34:40.451 --> 34:42.735
You'll not walk away from this.
You can either talk to me

34:42.856 --> 34:44.550
or to the Justice Department.

34:44.670 --> 34:47.505
You hired me to investigate
your husband and I found nothing.

34:47.827 --> 34:50.135
And now you stand here and give me shit?

34:50.255 --> 34:52.292
Are you really that stupid?

34:52.413 --> 34:56.563
This thing that Carl is working on,
the magnetobacteria. It is insanity!

34:56.975 --> 34:59.974
And it's escalating. It's not
just gonna stop at airport closures

35:00.094 --> 35:03.568
and stock manipulations.
God knows where this thing is gonna go!

35:03.688 --> 35:07.317
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

35:07.669 --> 35:09.905
So he got to you, didn't he, Jonny?

35:14.167 --> 35:17.018
All right, well,
you can walk away from this one.

35:18.412 --> 35:20.163
But you gotta give me something.

35:21.710 --> 35:23.856
At least let me try and stop him.

35:25.816 --> 35:27.660
This is bad, yes?

35:29.095 --> 35:30.547
This is really bad.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.509
People could die.

35:33.585 --> 35:34.925
A lot of people.

35:39.634 --> 35:41.393
There's a numbered company

35:41.670 --> 35:43.003
in the Caymans.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.502
That account...

35:48.533 --> 35:50.507
is the tip of your iceberg.

35:52.120 --> 35:54.114
You'll keep my name out of this?

35:55.088 --> 35:58.561
I'm gonna tell anyone who cares
to listen that you came to your senses.

36:00.264 --> 36:01.594
You know what?

36:02.128 --> 36:05.326
You're worried
about this magnetobacteria.

36:07.656 --> 36:10.756
I'm worried about somebody getting
a bullet in the back of the head.

36:12.584 --> 36:14.035
Good night, Rachel.

36:39.969 --> 36:40.702
Hey.

36:45.507 --> 36:46.615
You okay?

36:47.754 --> 36:49.034
Been better.

36:50.119 --> 36:51.298
What's this?

36:51.986 --> 36:54.011
Numbered Cayman Island company.

36:55.825 --> 36:57.578
Relates to the coltan shipment.

36:57.709 --> 37:00.055
It's exactly what I've been looking for.
Where'd you get this?

37:03.400 --> 37:04.297
Rach?

37:04.770 --> 37:06.510
You know, all this time,

37:07.918 --> 37:10.879
I've been wanting to catch him,
just hoping that he would slip up,

37:10.999 --> 37:13.313
- and we're almost there.
- Almost.

37:15.787 --> 37:17.666
So why don't I feel better?

37:20.775 --> 37:22.911
Maybe because
he was your husband for 25 years.

37:23.153 --> 37:24.451
It just got so big.

37:24.573 --> 37:26.409
He pushed it so far.

37:26.584 --> 37:28.515
You're doing the right thing.

37:29.551 --> 37:30.710
You think?

37:34.830 --> 37:37.259
I'm gonna get
onto this numbered company.

37:40.401 --> 37:42.055
Okay. Thanks.

37:54.424 --> 37:57.505
Remember when all we had
for a brain scan was an EEG?

37:57.627 --> 37:58.579
Yeah.

37:59.443 --> 38:01.491
- That feel okay?
- Perfect.

38:01.733 --> 38:02.589
Okay.

38:05.401 --> 38:08.331
This is the optical array.
If you could just help me out here,

38:08.573 --> 38:09.688
make sure it works.

38:09.872 --> 38:12.252
This'll stimulate your retina
so we can track the brain activity

38:12.494 --> 38:14.383
in your visual cortex.

38:14.664 --> 38:18.091
And if it works okay, we can insert
nano-trellises into the other eye.

38:19.161 --> 38:21.025
That's what I'm hoping for.

38:22.906 --> 38:24.222
Enjoy the show.

38:29.026 --> 38:32.131
So this is the MRI of Bob's brain.

38:33.223 --> 38:35.525
And this is
the geodesic sensor net's output.

38:36.213 --> 38:39.890
The optic nerve from the eye
that we treated is firing beautifully.

38:40.768 --> 38:43.283
- I'm feeling odd, David.
- Why, what's the matter?

38:43.525 --> 38:45.952
- Are you a little claustrophobic?
- It's very uncomfortable.

38:46.409 --> 38:50.123
Just hang in there for a little
bit longer, Bob. What is this here?

38:50.365 --> 38:53.084
- Structure below the frontal lobes.
- I don't know.

38:53.547 --> 38:57.130
Whatever it is, I've never seen it
active in any other brain scan.

38:58.967 --> 39:01.843
- David, I think I need to leave.
- Bob, just relax, breathe.

39:02.085 --> 39:04.262
- Bob, it'll be all right.
- I've to get out of here.

39:11.743 --> 39:13.257
He'll be all right.

39:14.761 --> 39:16.858
We'll call you.
Bob!

39:23.616 --> 39:26.023
- I don't know what came over me, David.
- Listen to me, Bob.

39:26.144 --> 39:28.235
Clearly, there is
something going on in your brain.

39:28.356 --> 39:30.680
You can't just become empathic
and deal with feelings

39:30.802 --> 39:33.108
if you've never encountered them before.

39:33.228 --> 39:35.763
That brain scan will give us a clue
as to what's happening.

39:35.883 --> 39:37.337
We just need to pin it down.

39:37.831 --> 39:40.729
David, I know this sounds weird,
but when I panicked back there

39:40.849 --> 39:42.672
Just forget about it. It's over.

39:42.794 --> 39:45.132
- But Dr. Turnbull...
- What about her?

39:45.252 --> 39:48.156
It wasn't exactly panic.
It was something else.

39:49.423 --> 39:51.370
I must have really upset her.

39:51.772 --> 39:53.672
I should call and apologize.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.160
David.

40:09.872 --> 40:11.371
You had better come in here.

40:15.573 --> 40:16.584
What's up?

40:17.053 --> 40:19.357
We were doing some scans
on the magnetobacteria.

40:19.477 --> 40:21.464
- Take a look at the magnetosome.
- Yeah?

40:22.082 --> 40:24.127
- What are those?
- That's exactly what we asked.

40:24.250 --> 40:26.673
I thought it might be related to
how the biofilm was formed,

40:26.793 --> 40:29.055
how it could be dirt.
So I decided to take a closer look.

40:32.202 --> 40:33.342
A smiley face.

40:33.462 --> 40:35.186
I hear you're looking for someone.

40:35.498 --> 40:36.951
I think I can help.

40:37.691 --> 40:39.406
<i>That's Robbie McCain's calling card.</i>

40:39.558 --> 40:41.109
<i>But Robbie McCain is dead.</i>

40:41.351 --> 40:44.150
Yeah, but he was working with
the DARPA lab synthesizing smallpox.

40:44.274 --> 40:47.712
- Could they be involved?
- No, he stole the smallpox from them.

40:47.832 --> 40:50.065
They had nothing to do
with his terrorism.

40:50.189 --> 40:54.432
Is this a signature of a terrorist group
that Robbie McCain was a part of?

40:54.616 --> 40:56.625
I got a bigger question for you.

40:56.837 --> 41:00.981
If Carl Riddlemeyer is somehow involved
with all this magnetobacteria bullshit,

41:02.140 --> 41:04.592
was he involved with the smallpox, too?

41:06.513 --> 41:08.428
You want me to go to the <i>Washington Post</i>

41:08.670 --> 41:12.447
and tell them that Carlton Riddlemeyer,
the science Czar of the USA,

41:12.569 --> 41:15.685
is behind acts of biological terrorism
for financial gain.

41:15.927 --> 41:17.562
Fine. Call the <i>New York Times.</i>

41:17.804 --> 41:19.654
Cornering the market
on tantalum is one thing,

41:19.787 --> 41:22.525
but threatening to shut down
the world's electronic infrastructure

41:22.767 --> 41:25.388
and a smallpox outbreak,
that's just not Carl.

41:25.508 --> 41:27.068
All right, all right.

41:27.312 --> 41:30.052
What're we looking at? I mean, okay...

41:31.841 --> 41:35.446
Robbie McCain's calling card shows up.
Clearly,

41:35.998 --> 41:38.161
Robbie McCain was not working alone.

41:38.387 --> 41:41.550
So we know that Carl
was tied into a tantalum scam,

41:41.676 --> 41:44.464
and Jonny Frank's guy,
he gave you that numbered company.

41:44.631 --> 41:46.833
He said that was just
the "tip of the iceberg", right?

41:47.000 --> 41:49.531
And we know
that Riddlemeyer has connections

41:49.735 --> 41:54.099
to Northern Sky, one of only four labs
in the United States

41:54.526 --> 41:57.296
that's working with the magnetobacteria.

41:57.471 --> 41:58.687
I don't know.

41:59.978 --> 42:00.905
Yet.

42:03.007 --> 42:05.276
Look,
have Mayko look into Robbie McCain.

42:05.518 --> 42:06.736
She already did.

42:06.978 --> 42:10.587
I mean dig deep. Everything.
Where he went to day care.

42:10.707 --> 42:13.801
Who he took to the prom.
Who the best man at his wedding was.

42:13.921 --> 42:16.295
And you'll have another look
at Northern Sky Laboratories.

42:16.417 --> 42:18.873
Find out exactly what they were doing
with the magnetobacteria.

42:19.115 --> 42:20.417
Rachel, work with Carlos.

42:20.659 --> 42:22.669
We've to find a way
to stop this primordial goo

42:22.911 --> 42:25.463
before it shuts down every
circuit board on the planet.

42:32.691 --> 42:34.112
What do they want?

42:35.719 --> 42:37.054
The smiley face gang.

42:37.176 --> 42:39.894
Why haven't they tried to contact me
like during the smallpox scare?

42:40.360 --> 42:43.048
Maybe 'cause they didn't get
what they wanted last time.

42:43.170 --> 42:46.137
But what about Riddlemeyer?
He's connected to the magnetobacteria,

42:46.269 --> 42:48.445
but the smiley face people?
What's that all about?

42:49.079 --> 42:52.699
David's right. The smallpox wasn't
about money. It was about principle.

42:52.941 --> 42:55.160
Carl doesn't have a principle
in his body. No offence.

42:55.531 --> 42:56.716
None taken.

42:57.064 --> 42:58.953
So then, he's not connected?

42:59.073 --> 43:00.665
No, he's dirty all right.

43:02.225 --> 43:04.228
Something's just not there.

43:08.446 --> 43:11.288
{\pos(200,225)}I had some sort of breakdown.
I'm not sure.

43:11.408 --> 43:13.657
I think the virus is doing
something more to Bob,

43:13.777 --> 43:15.472
and in particular his Jacobson's Organ.

43:15.714 --> 43:16.926
You can't be serious.

43:17.048 --> 43:20.059
The vomeronasal organ has been dormant
in humans for millions of years.

43:20.301 --> 43:22.145
We're shutting down the virus.

43:22.590 --> 43:25.560
David, don't be angry or frustrated.

43:25.680 --> 43:28.443
Nothing makes sense, Bob.
I don't know what is going on!

43:28.685 --> 43:31.988
- What do you know about smallpox?
- What's the link with magnetobacteria?

43:32.230 --> 43:34.282
- A smiley face.
- I'm sorry.

43:34.524 --> 43:36.117
Who's behind the smallpox?

43:36.940 --> 43:39.239
A million computer batteries
are being recalled.

43:39.359 --> 43:41.039
They're heating up, could explode.

43:41.281 --> 43:43.166
It'll take a lot of tantalum
to replace them.

43:45.072 --> 43:46.920
Holy... Carl, I got a lot of work to do.

43:47.162 --> 43:48.922
- You gotta go.
- What just happened?

43:49.436 --> 43:52.747
He's not in his apartment. Doesn't
look like he's been there all night.

43:52.869 --> 43:54.969
- What about the police?
- They have a description.

43:55.211 --> 43:57.722
They also know the situation.
Same with Immigration and Customs.

43:57.964 --> 44:00.948
Damn it! If you do anything to Bob,
I will find you.

44:01.069 --> 44:02.717
I'll rip your head off!

44:03.305 --> 44:09.874
