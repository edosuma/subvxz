00:13.041 --> 00:14.710
I didn't know you were
looking for work again.

00:14.777 --> 00:18.079
Yeah, I have offers from a few hospitals.

00:18.147 --> 00:20.018
But if I'm gonna go back to
yanking out little miracles,

00:20.086 --> 00:22.692
it's got to be a perfect fit.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.394
And I know what you're gonna ask about next:
my dating life,

00:25.462 --> 00:26.964
which you always do, even though

00:27.031 --> 00:29.403
- it's a little Luke-and-Leia-ish.
- So...

00:29.471 --> 00:30.574
you're dating someone?

00:30.642 --> 00:33.111
I'm dating lots of someones.

00:33.179 --> 00:35.917
Oh. It's fun.
I never... played the field before.

00:35.988 --> 00:39.331
Although it can get a
little weird sometimes.

00:39.399 --> 00:42.679
Like, on a first date,
have you ever showed a girl your...?

00:43.539 --> 00:45.743
Speaking of nuts.

00:45.810 --> 00:48.084
Hey, Mom.

00:48.152 --> 00:50.454
Uh, okay.

00:50.522 --> 00:52.963
No, no.
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

00:53.030 --> 00:55.401
Because there are trained
professionals there.

00:55.469 --> 00:58.741
No, I'm not calling you crazy.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.045
Uh, Kristen, Mom, Mom...

01:00.112 --> 01:01.146
maybe I should...

01:01.213 --> 01:02.513
Let me in! Let me in!

01:02.580 --> 01:04.613
Ryan, come on! It's an emergency!

01:04.681 --> 01:06.949
What?

01:08.253 --> 01:10.388
Oh!

01:10.456 --> 01:11.856
Oh, my God.

01:11.923 --> 01:13.692
That was close.

01:13.759 --> 01:15.663
I almost shook myself off <i> outside</i> your door.

01:15.731 --> 01:17.131
(Jenna groans)

01:17.199 --> 01:20.001
Sorry. He rolled in a
puddle on the way over here.

01:20.069 --> 01:22.305
I don't know why he always does that inside.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.210
Eh, he's a dog.
You could tell him to stop doing something

01:24.277 --> 01:26.711
- a thousand times.
- What if you forget

01:26.779 --> 01:29.448
to turn off your stove and then you
end up blowing up your whole building?

01:29.516 --> 01:32.288
- Okay, well, let me remind you...
- I'm sorry. Family business.

01:32.356 --> 01:34.627
I get it. I have to get to work.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.130
Oh, wait.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.835
Spare key.
I have to go into the office tonight,

01:39.903 --> 01:42.070
- so you can just pick him up whenever.
- Thanks.

01:42.138 --> 01:44.139
Sorry.

01:44.207 --> 01:46.310
No, you are not driving
through a parking garage.

01:46.378 --> 01:47.846
Because there are no parking garages there,
Mom.

01:47.914 --> 01:49.381
And you don't even have a car.

01:49.449 --> 01:51.284
You know what, this is why you and every...

01:51.352 --> 01:53.356
Hello?

01:53.423 --> 01:54.592
(groans)

01:54.659 --> 01:55.627
What's going on?

01:55.695 --> 01:57.431
Mom thinks she's ready

01:57.498 --> 01:58.765
to leave the sanitarium.

01:58.833 --> 02:01.503
I said no, obviously. Thank God

02:01.571 --> 02:04.043
I'm her legal guardian. Imagine if
these decisions were left up to her

02:04.111 --> 02:07.049
and not me. She'd be walking
the street with no clothes on,

02:07.117 --> 02:09.952
rooting through garbage,
just pissing and shitting in public.

02:10.020 --> 02:12.257
- And?
- Where are you going?

02:12.324 --> 02:14.161
To Clouds. Nobody hangs up on me

02:14.229 --> 02:15.897
in the middle of me yelling at them.

02:15.965 --> 02:17.597
Well, I was already planning
on visiting her today.

02:17.665 --> 02:18.966
I-I can talk to her for you.

02:19.035 --> 02:21.137
I think I'd rather do that myself.

02:21.205 --> 02:23.038
I can be a lot meaner than you can.

02:23.106 --> 02:24.639
Yeah,
but that's gonna put you in a bad mood.

02:24.707 --> 02:27.744
Besides, I can be pretty mean, too.

02:27.811 --> 02:29.914
- Bitch.
- Hoo, hoo, hoo.

02:29.982 --> 02:31.482
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that,

02:31.550 --> 02:34.030
you dickless, syphilitic runt.

02:35.254 --> 02:37.491
She's good.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.528
Real good.

02:41.096 --> 02:43.430
"You're as crazy as your mother."

02:43.497 --> 02:45.298
That's what he said, right?

02:45.365 --> 02:47.968
The weird thing is I never
mentioned your mom to Bruce.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.235
Or whoever that old guy was.

02:50.303 --> 02:52.969
H-How do you think I
should bring up the idea

02:53.036 --> 02:55.036
of my mom leaving Clouds?

02:55.104 --> 02:57.971
I just don't want her to
get all worked up about it.

02:58.039 --> 03:00.407
I thought we were going out there
to ask Catherine about Bruce.

03:00.475 --> 03:02.510
We are. I just figured, while we're there,

03:02.578 --> 03:04.642
I might as well smooth things
over between Kristen and her.

03:04.709 --> 03:05.942
Why?

03:06.010 --> 03:07.676
You heard my sister on the phone.

03:07.744 --> 03:09.079
They're always at each
other's throats like that.

03:09.146 --> 03:11.015
It's up to me to keep the peace.

03:11.082 --> 03:12.949
Or maybe they keep bickering
because you stop the fights

03:13.015 --> 03:14.615
before they get to the late rounds,

03:14.683 --> 03:16.384
when the real heavy punches start landing

03:16.452 --> 03:18.923
and the weaknesses and
vulnerabilities get exposed

03:18.991 --> 03:21.158
and Bald Bull starts doing the Bull
Charge and, before you know it,

03:21.226 --> 03:22.794
Mario's just like...
(video game sound)

03:22.861 --> 03:24.898
You don't know my family.
I have to stop things

03:24.965 --> 03:27.001
from blowing up before
it gets out of control.

03:27.068 --> 03:30.046
Look, I know your parents'
divorce must have been...

03:30.072 --> 03:31.439
a slight bummer.

03:31.465 --> 03:33.181
You mean the worst
experience of my childhood?

03:33.207 --> 03:35.241
But this isn't that.

03:35.309 --> 03:37.577
I know.
You're the one who made the comparison.

03:37.645 --> 03:39.313
Fine, whatever.

03:39.380 --> 03:40.747
As long as we're going
out to visit Catherine,

03:40.815 --> 03:42.251
that's all that matters.

03:42.318 --> 03:44.719
Ever since her cat died,
the burden of responsibility

03:44.787 --> 03:47.789
has fallen on me to cheer her
up when she's feeling blue,

03:47.856 --> 03:51.692
- to lick her face when it's covered in Funyun dust.
- Yeah, right.

03:51.760 --> 03:55.365
- You love the attention.
- Doesn't make it any less of a burden.

03:56.134 --> 03:58.270
Aw.

03:58.296 --> 04:00.132
(chuckles) WILFRED: Really?

04:00.641 --> 04:02.240
- What?
- Three-legged dogs

04:02.308 --> 04:04.207
are the scourge of the dog community.

04:04.275 --> 04:05.676
While the rest of us are out there

04:05.743 --> 04:07.145
working our asses off to get some attention,

04:07.213 --> 04:09.182
these lazy pieces of shit just rock up

04:09.249 --> 04:10.817
and get treated like royalty.

04:10.885 --> 04:13.318
Drop it, boy. Drop it.

04:13.386 --> 04:14.987
Good boy! Good boy, Ralston.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.922
I didn't know you had a dog,

04:16.990 --> 04:18.324
- Dr. Cahill.
- He doesn't.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.058
He has three-fourths of one.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.793
Oh, I got Ralston years ago

04:21.862 --> 04:24.032
after I suffered a traumatic incident.

04:24.100 --> 04:28.336
I don't know if I ever told you this,
but I... I was...

04:28.404 --> 04:30.971
- Raped?
- Gang-raped.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.637
Let me give you some advice, young man.

04:33.705 --> 04:36.201
Think before you blare your horn at a van.

04:36.269 --> 04:38.801
Thanks to Ralston, it's getting easier

04:38.868 --> 04:40.636
for me to talk about the, uh...

04:40.704 --> 04:42.105
incident, and he seems

04:42.172 --> 04:44.207
to inspire a lot of the patients here,
as well,

04:44.275 --> 04:46.506
so I bring him in a few times a month.

04:46.574 --> 04:49.108
Please.
The only thing a three-legged dog inspires

04:49.176 --> 04:50.909
is overcoming your worst fears

04:50.977 --> 04:53.075
and doing the impossible
and achieving your dreams.

04:53.143 --> 04:55.646
It's like, eat a dick, dude.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.996
Hey, your mom looks different.

04:58.165 --> 05:01.236
So healthy. Did she do a cleanse?

05:01.303 --> 05:03.506
There he is! Oh, come here, boy!

05:03.574 --> 05:05.876
Excuse me, Ryan. Duty calls.

05:05.944 --> 05:07.879
- Oh.
- Watch out, Catherine.

05:07.946 --> 05:09.781
There's my little snuggle-butt.

05:09.849 --> 05:11.449
Hi.

05:11.517 --> 05:12.683
- Oh, you come here.
- Hey, Mom.

05:12.751 --> 05:15.185
Oh. Hi, Ryan.

05:15.253 --> 05:17.386
Sweetie.

05:17.454 --> 05:19.522
- (laughs)
- Dr. Cahill.

05:19.590 --> 05:21.491
Morning, Catherine.

05:21.558 --> 05:25.761
Well, I'll leave you two to catch up.

05:28.366 --> 05:31.000
Mom, do you know a guy named Bruce?

05:37.145 --> 05:39.345
Mom?

05:42.368 --> 05:44.804
I knew this day would come.

05:44.872 --> 05:47.804
(sighs)

05:47.872 --> 05:50.909
I-I should have told you
about him a long time ago.

05:50.976 --> 05:55.978
I don't know how I ever let him
suck me into those stupid games.

05:56.045 --> 05:59.816
Games?

05:59.883 --> 06:01.643
Every Wednesday night,
we'd sneak down into the boiler room.

06:01.669 --> 06:03.368
Wait. What?

06:03.920 --> 06:06.919
(whispers): Poker.

06:06.987 --> 06:11.092
Gambling is against the rules.

06:11.159 --> 06:13.293
We're talking about Bruce Chang, right?

06:13.361 --> 06:16.261
Down-down the hall in room 204?

06:16.329 --> 06:19.367
And you're sure you don't
know any other Bruces?

06:19.434 --> 06:21.568
It's not like I get a chance

06:21.636 --> 06:23.672
to meet a lot of new people here.

06:23.740 --> 06:26.945
I'm gonna get some lemon.

06:27.013 --> 06:29.080
My name's Wilfred.

06:29.148 --> 06:30.582
It's nice

06:30.649 --> 06:32.218
to meet you.

06:32.285 --> 06:34.421
Ah, I forgot.

06:34.489 --> 06:35.990
You can't do that, can you?

06:36.058 --> 06:38.957
Oh, hey,
want to see what a human vagina looks like?

06:39.025 --> 06:41.295
Check it out.
I put my paws like this, and you put your...

06:41.343 --> 06:46.110
Oh, shit.
You can't really do anything, can you?

06:50.101 --> 06:52.504
(sighs)

06:52.596 --> 06:55.865
Listen, Kristen told me you're
thinking about leaving Clouds.

06:55.932 --> 06:58.200
Oh, I get it.

06:58.268 --> 07:01.970
Kristen sent you here to
be her happiness assassin.

07:02.038 --> 07:03.538
No, I'd...

07:03.606 --> 07:05.874
We'd love to see you back out in the world,

07:05.941 --> 07:08.144
but we tried it once, and it didn't work.

07:08.212 --> 07:10.046
I'm on new medication,

07:10.113 --> 07:12.884
and Dr. Cahill says I'm
doing better than ever.

07:12.952 --> 07:16.090
I've given this a lot of thought,
Ryan, and...

07:16.157 --> 07:19.494
I don't want to die in here.

07:21.997 --> 07:24.477
Well, I guess if you think you're ready.

07:24.532 --> 07:26.466
Oh, honey, thank you.

07:26.534 --> 07:28.802
(sighs)

07:28.869 --> 07:30.704
I know it's legally Kristen's decision,

07:30.772 --> 07:33.005
but it'll help that you're on my side.

07:33.073 --> 07:35.239
Yeah.

07:35.306 --> 07:37.008
Why don't you let me talk to Kristen?

07:37.076 --> 07:40.178
I'll catch her when she's in a good mood.

07:40.246 --> 07:42.546
Look...

07:42.614 --> 07:44.715
I know I'm a little kooky,

07:44.783 --> 07:48.553
but...
in some ways, sanity is like my fourth leg,

07:48.620 --> 07:52.223
and if Ralston can get by without his,

07:52.290 --> 07:54.595
so can I.

07:54.662 --> 07:57.795
(laughs)

07:57.863 --> 07:59.731
I can't believe I let this happen.

07:59.798 --> 08:01.433
Remind me to never agree to anything

08:01.500 --> 08:03.670
while I'm listening to R.
Kelly on muscle relaxants.

08:03.738 --> 08:05.639
Mom will be fine, and if she's not,

08:05.707 --> 08:07.565
I'm only a few blocks away, like we agreed.

08:07.591 --> 08:09.759
Well, I, for one, am thrilled for Catherine.

08:10.109 --> 08:12.144
Oh, what? You think I'm only glad

08:12.212 --> 08:14.846
'cause she's away from that
three-legged freak show?

08:14.914 --> 08:17.180
The idea that I might
be even a little jealous

08:17.248 --> 08:18.681
of Ralston is just...

08:18.748 --> 08:20.281
It's-it's just...

08:20.349 --> 08:22.784
Hello?

08:22.851 --> 08:24.320
What the hell?!

08:24.387 --> 08:26.255
That's <i> my</i> head-laying lap!

08:26.397 --> 08:29.050
Why-why are you here so early?

08:29.076 --> 08:31.611
You told us to come over at 11:00.

08:31.679 --> 08:35.221
- I'm pretty sure I said 1:00.
- Mom, you definitely said 11:00.

08:35.299 --> 08:36.902
Hey, Cathy-cakes, have you seen my...?

08:36.969 --> 08:38.938
Whoa.

08:39.006 --> 08:41.039
Looks like

08:41.105 --> 08:45.410
Ralston isn't the only
three-legged dog in Mom's life.

08:47.815 --> 08:49.949
- Kristen! Kristen?!
- (sighs)

08:50.016 --> 08:51.716
This is why you wanted to move out?

08:51.784 --> 08:54.351
So you could carry on a secret
affair with your therapist?

08:54.419 --> 08:55.987
It's not an affair.

08:56.055 --> 08:58.086
- Elliott and I are in love!
- Okay.

08:58.154 --> 08:59.888
Even if you <i> think</i> you're in love,

08:59.956 --> 09:01.324
which I find very hard to believe,

09:01.391 --> 09:03.227
it's completely unethical...
not to mention illegal...

09:03.295 --> 09:05.962
for a doctor to have a
relationship with his patient!

09:06.030 --> 09:07.263
You are going back to Clouds

09:07.331 --> 09:08.832
where you'll never see Elliott again,

09:08.899 --> 09:10.334
because his ass is getting fired.

09:10.401 --> 09:11.970
No!

09:12.038 --> 09:13.707
- I'm never going back!
- Yes, you are!

09:13.775 --> 09:16.491
Mom, go inside. Please.

09:16.811 --> 09:19.647
That's nice, Mom. Yeah.

09:19.714 --> 09:21.382
Real mature!

09:21.450 --> 09:23.821
Is it so horrible

09:23.889 --> 09:25.356
that she'd find someone
after all these years?

09:25.424 --> 09:27.324
She's obviously not well,
and Dr. Cahill knows that.

09:27.391 --> 09:29.092
So either he's criminally
taking advantage of her,

09:29.160 --> 09:31.095
or he's just as insane as she is.

09:31.162 --> 09:33.666
So, you're prepared to throw
away your whole relationship

09:33.692 --> 09:36.227
- with Mom?
- She's the one throwing it away!

09:36.253 --> 09:38.420
At least take a day to think about it...
for me.

09:38.571 --> 09:42.730
After you've calmed down,
if you still feel the same way...

09:44.128 --> 09:46.555
I'll support your decision.

09:46.581 --> 09:48.148
(scoffs)

09:51.786 --> 09:53.521
WILFRED: Do it.

09:53.589 --> 09:55.922
Just do it!

09:55.990 --> 09:57.489
Cut it off!

09:57.558 --> 09:59.026
Come on! We had a pact!

09:59.094 --> 10:00.630
What do you mean,

10:00.698 --> 10:02.531
this is the first you're
hearing about a pact,

10:02.599 --> 10:04.898
and I cut off your arm with a
chainsaw after drugging you?

10:04.966 --> 10:06.266
What are you doing?

10:06.334 --> 10:07.869
I thought you hated three-legged dogs.

10:07.936 --> 10:09.535
As long as Ralston is still

10:09.602 --> 10:11.282
in Catherine's life, I don't stand a chance

10:11.304 --> 10:13.038
at reclaiming her affections.

10:13.106 --> 10:15.476
Well, you don't have to
chop off your arm or... leg.

10:15.544 --> 10:17.949
Kristen is gonna end up
sending Mom back to Clouds,

10:18.016 --> 10:19.618
so Ralston's out of the picture.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.126
We both know that's not gonna happen.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.989
You'll find a way to keep the peace

10:23.057 --> 10:24.592
between Catherine and Kristen.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.262
You always do.

10:26.330 --> 10:29.033
Seriously, Bear,
if you don't cut this leg off,

10:29.101 --> 10:31.001
I'm breaking up with you.

10:31.069 --> 10:34.468
Oh, what do you mean,
"That's a brilliant idea"?

10:35.436 --> 10:38.339
What do you mean,
the solution to both of our problems is

10:38.365 --> 10:41.354
for Ryan to break up
Catherine and Dr. Cahill?

10:41.380 --> 10:42.787
What do you mean, I always say

10:42.813 --> 10:43.732
"What do you mean,"

10:43.758 --> 10:47.062
then repeat everything you just said,
word for word?

10:49.824 --> 10:51.693
We often spoke about our feelings,

10:51.719 --> 10:53.954
but we were celibate at Clouds.

10:54.062 --> 10:56.899
It was only after your mother left that I,
uh...

10:56.925 --> 10:59.496
well, how should I put this delicately?...

10:59.522 --> 11:03.656
um... knocked the dust off it?

11:05.558 --> 11:07.928
Well... uh, either way,

11:07.954 --> 11:09.688
Kristen still thinks she can get you fired.

11:09.714 --> 11:11.146
Then let them fire me.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.542
Ryan, do you know the day I realized

11:13.610 --> 11:16.978
that your mother wasn't just
another run-of-the-mill,

11:17.046 --> 11:20.246
delusional, bipolar, manic-depressive?

11:20.314 --> 11:23.348
We were in group, and she was reading a poem

11:23.416 --> 11:25.648
that she had written

11:25.716 --> 11:28.820
about a dwarf stuck in a laundry machine.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.287
Since that day, we have brought each other

11:31.355 --> 11:33.189
nothing but happiness.

11:33.256 --> 11:37.121
If I end this relationship,
clinically speaking,

11:37.188 --> 11:41.992
then I'm going to be making
her the opposite of happy.

11:43.325 --> 11:45.428
(Both) Sad.

11:45.495 --> 11:47.599
Right.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.701
But-but if you don't break up with her,

11:49.768 --> 11:51.470
Kristen will use your relationship

11:51.537 --> 11:54.249
to send her back to Clouds.

11:54.275 --> 11:56.711
Not only that.
You saw the way they were fighting.

11:56.820 --> 11:58.888
This would tear them apart.

11:58.914 --> 12:01.518
Maybe irreparably.

12:03.116 --> 12:06.289
Ugh!
I'd hate to be the cause of familial strife.

12:07.631 --> 12:11.139
If you truly love her, let her go.

12:11.595 --> 12:14.230
I guess we're all just...

12:14.256 --> 12:16.858
dwarves stuck in laundry machines.

12:16.926 --> 12:20.588
(crying) Oh, goddamn. I'm sorry.

12:24.512 --> 12:26.912
I'm not a monster, Ryan.
I agreed not to tell Clouds

12:26.980 --> 12:28.246
about that quack boning our mother,
didn't I?

12:28.314 --> 12:30.046
I'm just saying, she had her heart broken.

12:30.114 --> 12:32.215
She needs our support
right now more than ever.

12:32.282 --> 12:34.784
Loud and clear, Ryan, and with Ralston

12:34.852 --> 12:37.589
finally out of her life,
Mom's going to need a lot

12:37.657 --> 12:39.157
of showering me with love

12:39.183 --> 12:41.149
to get her through this horrible depression.

12:41.259 --> 12:42.926
(knocking) I'll get it!

12:42.994 --> 12:44.896
I'll get it! I'll get it!

12:44.963 --> 12:46.203
I'll get it. I'll get it.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.104
Ryan, hurry up. Open this door.

12:48.172 --> 12:51.108
I'll get it! I'll get it!

12:51.176 --> 12:54.144
- What the hell is he doing here?!
- Hi, Mom.

12:54.212 --> 12:56.619
Don't you dare step one
non-foot in this house!

12:56.686 --> 12:58.255
Settle down, Wilfred.

12:58.323 --> 13:00.089
I thought Ralston belonged to Dr. Cahill.

13:00.157 --> 13:03.414
He did, but when we broke up,

13:03.440 --> 13:06.215
Elliott said he knew how
much Ralston meant to me,

13:06.241 --> 13:08.408
so he said I could keep him.

13:08.434 --> 13:10.034
Don't worry.

13:10.102 --> 13:13.365
I left him with something to remember me by,
too.

13:13.433 --> 13:15.767
And I hope it burns.

13:15.835 --> 13:17.802
- Ew, Mom.
- What?

13:17.870 --> 13:20.235
I-I gave him some of my old incense.

13:23.072 --> 13:25.275
He said he felt like we
were moving too fast,

13:25.343 --> 13:28.276
and he wasn't sure if he was
ready to give up his career.

13:28.344 --> 13:30.244
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Well, maybe you were right.

13:30.312 --> 13:34.183
Maybe he was taking advantage
of his position. Also,

13:34.251 --> 13:36.151
he dropped the rape card way too much.

13:36.219 --> 13:38.054
You don't get out of doing the dishes

13:38.080 --> 13:40.274
just because you got gang-raped.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.666
I'm just glad you got away from him.

13:42.858 --> 13:44.859
Look at him, getting my lap, my treats.

13:44.927 --> 13:48.198
CAHILL: Catherine!

13:48.266 --> 13:50.298
Catherine!

13:51.599 --> 13:53.501
Catherine!

13:53.569 --> 13:56.138
Catherine!

13:56.206 --> 13:58.271
Dr. Cahill, what-what are you doing here?

13:58.339 --> 14:00.106
I was at the bar trying to forget

14:00.132 --> 14:01.569
how much my life totally sucks

14:01.595 --> 14:02.875
when I got your Facebook message.

14:02.901 --> 14:04.056
My Facebook message?

14:04.082 --> 14:06.923
Yeah, I left as soon as I read it.

14:06.949 --> 14:08.284
Actually, it's not true.

14:08.310 --> 14:10.114
First I accepted your friend request,

14:10.140 --> 14:11.775
then I checked out all your photos,

14:11.801 --> 14:13.401
and I read everything on your wall.

14:13.427 --> 14:15.394
Oh, my God, I didn't know you were friends

14:15.420 --> 14:17.320
with the Squishy Tits chick.

14:17.596 --> 14:19.562
We should totally hang out sometime.

14:19.630 --> 14:21.697
- Catherine!
- What exactly did I say in my message

14:21.765 --> 14:23.232
that got you so... excited?

14:23.300 --> 14:24.533
Well, that Kristen changed her mind,

14:24.601 --> 14:26.267
and I should come right away.

14:26.335 --> 14:28.501
Oh, and to please sign your petition

14:28.569 --> 14:31.703
making fake-throwing gestures a felony.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.904
I'm all about that. Catherine!

14:33.972 --> 14:35.670
- Okay, we should go. Right now.
- What?

14:35.738 --> 14:37.171
- I signed your weird petition!
- Elliott?

14:37.238 --> 14:38.572
Catherine!

14:38.598 --> 14:40.099
(crying) Oh, my God, Catherine.

14:40.125 --> 14:42.057
Ryan, what is he doing here?!

14:42.083 --> 14:44.515
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

14:44.541 --> 14:47.521
I did not mean what I said.

14:47.547 --> 14:49.547
Being apart from you this past...

14:49.615 --> 14:52.646
uh, day has made me realize

14:52.714 --> 14:57.084
what life was like without you, and it...
blew.

14:57.152 --> 14:59.152
I don't ever want to lose you again.

14:59.220 --> 15:00.687
In fact... Cat...

15:00.755 --> 15:02.857
Yeah. Whoa. Hold that.

15:02.925 --> 15:05.989
Catherine Elizabeth

15:06.015 --> 15:10.253
Culpepper-Newman, will you marry me?

15:10.567 --> 15:13.272
Yes! (laughs)

15:13.298 --> 15:14.630
KRISTEN: That is it!

15:14.656 --> 15:17.721
I am calling Clouds!

15:17.747 --> 15:19.717
Aah! Oh, my God.

15:20.512 --> 15:24.382
Ryan, I'm getting married!

15:29.459 --> 15:31.060
What are you doing here?

15:31.127 --> 15:33.863
I'm sorry.
Do I detect a note of anger in your voice?

15:33.889 --> 15:36.176
You're joking, right?

15:36.202 --> 15:39.531
- Where are we going?
- <i>I'm</i> going to my mom's.

15:39.557 --> 15:41.759
Kristen's there waiting for the
Clouds people to come get her.

15:41.785 --> 15:43.620
I can't let that happen.

15:43.646 --> 15:46.090
(phone buzzes)

15:46.185 --> 15:47.685
"Weird pic. SMH."

15:47.753 --> 15:51.389
Why are people commenting
on a Facebook photo?

15:51.456 --> 15:53.291
I didn't post anything today.

15:57.330 --> 15:59.032
Jesus Christ!

15:59.100 --> 16:01.370
You're posting dick pics on my Facebook?

16:01.438 --> 16:05.809
Dick pics? I had my tail between
my legs because I was nervous.

16:05.876 --> 16:07.310
Even after I changed the password?

16:07.378 --> 16:09.746
Stop going on my Facebook!

16:09.813 --> 16:11.314
And that message that you sent last night?

16:11.382 --> 16:12.682
Thanks to you, my mom and Kristen

16:12.750 --> 16:14.083
are gonna tear each other's heads off!

16:14.151 --> 16:16.788
So what? Let them. It's easy for you to say

16:16.855 --> 16:18.959
when it's not on you to stop
the family from falling apart.

16:19.027 --> 16:21.862
Why is it on you, Ryan?
I get how hard it must have been

16:21.929 --> 16:23.930
to see your parents
fighting when you were kids,

16:23.998 --> 16:25.498
even harder to watch them split up,

16:25.566 --> 16:26.999
but it wasn't your fault.

16:27.067 --> 16:28.301
There's nothing you could have done.

16:28.368 --> 16:29.470
What does that have to do with this?

16:29.538 --> 16:30.973
Just because

16:30.999 --> 16:32.799
conflict tore your
parents apart doesn't mean

16:32.825 --> 16:34.826
it'll do the same with
your mom and your sister.

16:34.852 --> 16:37.093
Stop trying to analyze me.
You're not a psychiatrist.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.284
I'm just saying,
letting them slug it out now

16:39.351 --> 16:41.219
will be healthy for them in the long run.

16:41.287 --> 16:43.819
Any psychiatrist would tell
you exactly the same thing.

16:43.887 --> 16:45.857
Yeah. You look really nervous.

16:47.161 --> 16:48.829
Let's go.

16:48.897 --> 16:50.999
- I thought I wasn't going.
- You are now.

16:51.603 --> 16:53.737
KRISTEN: <i>She's down the hall</i> in the bedroom.

16:53.773 --> 16:56.326
Craig, Shawn,
this whole thing's a big misunderstanding.

16:56.352 --> 16:57.919
Sorry, Dr. C, we've got orders.

16:57.987 --> 17:00.121
Wait! Please, don't do this. I'm her son.

17:00.189 --> 17:03.455
And I'm her legal guardian. Go!

17:03.556 --> 17:05.258
Kristen, please.

17:05.326 --> 17:06.959
I'm doing it for her, Ryan.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.392
CATHERINE: Don't touch me!
Get your hands off me!

17:09.460 --> 17:12.364
You're not my daughter!

17:12.432 --> 17:14.200
No daughter of mine would purposefully try

17:14.268 --> 17:15.901
to destroy my happiness!

17:15.969 --> 17:17.969
You know,
I didn't ask to be in this situation.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.439
Maybe if I had a normal mother,

17:19.507 --> 17:20.441
I wouldn't be!

17:20.508 --> 17:21.909
Don't interfere, Ryan.

17:21.977 --> 17:24.218
Letting them slug it out now
is gonna be healthy for them

17:24.244 --> 17:25.914
in the long run.
Trust me, I'm a psychiatrist.

17:25.981 --> 17:27.316
- Yes, you are.
- You make me go back there,

17:27.385 --> 17:28.584
and that is the last you'll hear from me.

17:28.652 --> 17:30.584
Don't bother visiting.

17:30.652 --> 17:31.292
Don't even call!

17:31.318 --> 17:32.386
Fine with me.

17:32.412 --> 17:34.780
I'm sure it'll be easier
to spend all my time

17:34.823 --> 17:36.392
managing your craziness from a distance!

17:36.460 --> 17:38.559
Oh, because you're such a martyr!

17:38.627 --> 17:40.960
Why don't you want me to be happy?!

17:41.028 --> 17:43.262
- Because it's not fair!
- What do you mean, it's not fair?!

17:43.330 --> 17:45.400
Because I'm not happy!

17:48.971 --> 17:51.339
It's not fair

17:51.407 --> 17:55.376
that everybody else gets
to be happy except me!

17:55.402 --> 17:57.468
I ruined my marriage!

17:57.494 --> 18:00.056
Nobody wants me now!

18:00.082 --> 18:01.921
I don't have any job offers.

18:01.947 --> 18:04.417
And playing the field?

18:04.485 --> 18:06.817
I had one date in the last three months,

18:06.843 --> 18:08.943
and it was with a kiln
operator from Color Me Mine,

18:08.969 --> 18:11.706
and he just, like, hit it and quit it!

18:11.857 --> 18:14.125
(crying)

18:14.193 --> 18:16.660
Oh, honey.

18:18.663 --> 18:20.931
Oh, come here.

18:20.998 --> 18:23.268
(crying)

18:23.636 --> 18:26.705
Anything you want to say?

18:26.772 --> 18:29.772
No. I'm good.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.475
No, I mean to me, like, "You were right."

18:32.543 --> 18:33.944
Shut up, Wilfred.

18:34.012 --> 18:37.078
- Oh...
- (crying)

18:38.623 --> 18:42.019
I assume you're gonna get
back to focusing on the cult?

18:42.045 --> 18:43.879
- I don't think so.
- What?

18:43.946 --> 18:45.813
We've come so far.

18:45.881 --> 18:50.049
Maybe if my mom knew something about Bruce,
but I don't know.

18:50.116 --> 18:52.353
We're at a dead end for now.

18:52.421 --> 18:54.690
Are you still pissed off at Ralston?

18:54.758 --> 18:56.125
Ah, no.

18:56.151 --> 18:59.231
I've accepted I'll never be as
loved as a three-legged dog.

18:59.299 --> 19:01.368
They're just so damn inspirational.

19:01.436 --> 19:03.071
Hmm. That's big of you.

19:03.138 --> 19:05.340
Yeah, it was tough moving on from that,

19:05.408 --> 19:07.776
but I was inspired by Ralston to do so.

19:07.843 --> 19:11.914
It was also tough telling him
that I was inspired by him,

19:11.981 --> 19:13.849
but I was inspired by him to do that, too.

19:13.917 --> 19:15.684
(sighs)

19:15.752 --> 19:18.788
And just then,
telling you that I was inspired by him

19:18.855 --> 19:20.690
to tell him I was inspired by him,

19:20.758 --> 19:23.326
that was probably the hardest
thing of all for me to say.

19:23.394 --> 19:25.996
But I was inspired by Ralston to do that,
also.

19:26.063 --> 19:28.498
And when I admitted to you just now that...

19:28.566 --> 19:31.402
Oh, there you are. Come here, Wilfred!

19:31.469 --> 19:33.205
At least I'll always be someone's favorite.

19:33.231 --> 19:34.901
Ryan, I keep forgetting.

19:34.927 --> 19:37.829
- Here's your spare key back.
- I'll get it!

19:37.979 --> 19:39.413
(thudding, tires screeching)

19:39.480 --> 19:41.983
Wilfred! (screams)

19:42.050 --> 19:43.852
I'm okay. I'm okay.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.889
(groans)

19:45.956 --> 19:49.824
Holy... shit!

19:49.892 --> 19:51.593
I'm a three-legged dog, dude!

19:51.660 --> 19:53.763
(Wilfred whoops)
