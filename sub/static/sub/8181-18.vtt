00:41.840 --> 00:43.775
I DON'T KNOW WHY I ORDERED

00:47.196 --> 00:50.748

RIGHT AT ME.

01:10.169 --> 01:11.953
GO OVER THERE AND
SAY SOMETHING.

01:13.355 --> 01:15.490
YOU KNOW, HE'S PROBABLY JUST
STARING AT THESE WINE BOTTLES.

01:15.558 --> 01:17.258
LOOK AT HIM, HE LOOKS
LIKE A REAL BOOZER.

01:17.326 --> 01:19.644
CAN YOU JUST GO OVER
THERE AND SAY SOMETHING?

01:19.711 --> 01:21.846
YOU'RE MY HUSBAND! YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT ME.

01:21.948 --> 01:24.332

01:30.740 --> 01:32.974
HI. UH, LISTEN,

WINE BOTTLES OVER THERE,

01:34.927 --> 01:36.328
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND, IT'S JUST THAT

01:36.395 --> 01:38.346
THEY'RE RIGHT NEAR MY WIFE'S

SHE THINKS YOU'RE
STARING AT HER, SO-

01:40.266 --> 01:42.834

A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY?

01:52.327 --> 01:54.979

I'M IN THE WIG BUSINESS.

01:58.734 --> 02:02.570

02:04.941 --> 02:07.508

02:07.610 --> 02:09.811

SHE'S WILLING TO CUT...

02:09.877 --> 02:11.646
$2,000 TO $3,000.

02:11.713 --> 02:13.732

02:49.552 --> 02:50.752
YOU BARELY BRUSHED
YOUR HAIR.

02:50.820 --> 02:52.053
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO,
LIKE, 100 STROKES A NIGHT.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.287

02:53.355 --> 02:56.190

03:08.871 --> 03:10.972
<i>WOULD LOOK
REALLY GOOD...</i>

03:11.039 --> 03:12.674
WITH SHORT HAIR.

03:12.741 --> 03:16.410
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? YOU JUST
SAID YOU LOVED MY LONG HAIR.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.346
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT-

03:18.413 --> 03:20.281
IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW THE SAYING,

03:20.349 --> 03:22.517
YOU GOTTA
"SET IT FREE"!

03:22.585 --> 03:24.185
WHAT?

03:24.252 --> 03:26.087
AHEM. YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST
THINKING OUT LOUD HERE-

03:26.154 --> 03:28.690
WHEN WE DO CUT IT, WE SHOULD
PUT IT IN A BAG AND SELL IT.

03:28.757 --> 03:30.892
35, 36.
STOP.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.844
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU

03:32.912 --> 03:35.346

03:35.414 --> 03:38.650
ALL RIGHT? HE SAYS YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL
HAIR WE CAN MAKE A TON OF MONEY OFF!

03:38.751 --> 03:40.902
YOU WANT ME TO
SELL MY HAIR?

03:40.969 --> 03:43.721
LOOK. I KNOW IT SOUNDS WEIRD,
BUT HE'S TALKING, LIKE, $3,000.

03:43.789 --> 03:45.239
I REALLY DON'T CARE!

03:45.307 --> 03:46.775
WELL, CARRIE, COU-

03:46.842 --> 03:49.577
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
FOR A MINUTE, OK?

03:49.645 --> 03:51.429
FIRST OF ALL, WE COULD
REALLY USE THAT MONEY,

03:51.514 --> 03:53.647
AND, BONUS, WE COULD
BE HELPING OTHER PEOPLE.

03:53.715 --> 03:55.116
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T
BLESSED WITH YOUR

03:55.184 --> 03:57.151
THICK, BEAUTIFUL
LONG HAIR.

03:57.219 --> 04:00.939
ACTUALLY, IT WOULD BE
NICE TO- TO GIVE BACK.

04:00.973 --> 04:02.590
THERE YOU GO!

04:02.658 --> 04:04.843
SO $3,000, HUH?

04:04.910 --> 04:06.610
AND THE BEST PART ABOUT
IT IS A YEAR FROM NOW...

04:06.678 --> 04:08.579
YOU'LL HAVE A FULL HEAD

04:08.647 --> 04:09.814
IN THE POCKET AGAIN.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.600
WE COULD DO A LOT
WITH THAT MONEY, RIGHT?

04:12.667 --> 04:14.352
WE CAN GET THAT PIZZA OVEN
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

04:14.419 --> 04:19.324
OR, MORE, WE CAN GO ON THAT
CRUISE WITH DEACON AND KELLY!

04:19.391 --> 04:21.058
BETTER YET, WHEN
THEY COME BACK,

04:21.125 --> 04:22.593

04:23.946 --> 04:25.146

05:17.483 --> 05:19.216
WHERE'S CARRIE?

05:19.284 --> 05:22.670
UH, SHE'S UPSTAIRS
WORKING HER COMB-OVER.

05:24.039 --> 05:25.472
HAIRCUT NOT SO GOOD?

05:25.540 --> 05:28.309

THE "THREE STOOGES"?

05:29.377 --> 05:30.745

05:32.098 --> 05:34.315
TA-DA!

05:35.583 --> 05:37.368
SO, WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

05:37.436 --> 05:39.153
IT'S REALLY,

05:39.220 --> 05:40.321
SASSY?
YES!

05:40.388 --> 05:41.589

05:41.657 --> 05:43.424
THAT'S WHAT THE
STYLIST SAID!

05:43.492 --> 05:45.276
AND YOU KNOW, IT'S SO EASY TO MANAGE.

05:45.343 --> 05:47.712
I MEAN, MY HAIR DRIES
FASTER THAN HIS NOW.

05:47.780 --> 05:51.616
THAT'S TRUE,
IT DOES, IT DOES. FASTER.

05:51.683 --> 05:53.050
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA
GO SAY GOOD BYE TO MY DAD.

05:53.118 --> 05:55.320
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS LOAD
UP THE BAGS IN THE CAR, OK?

05:55.387 --> 05:56.470
OH, HONEY.

05:56.538 --> 05:58.990

CARDED AT THE LIQUOR STORE.

05:59.057 --> 06:02.093
OH.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.329

LOOKS LIKE A WEIRD BOY".

06:10.069 --> 06:12.187
OH, HEY. WE'RE
LEAVING NOW.

06:12.254 --> 06:14.239
WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU?

06:23.782 --> 06:25.817
I GOT
MY HAIR CUT, DAD.

06:25.884 --> 06:30.004
ANYWAY, WE'LL BE BACK ON
SUNDAY. I MADE YOU LASAGNA.

06:30.072 --> 06:32.606
I'M GONNA PUT IT IN THE OVEN
SO YOU CAN HAVE IT FOR LUNCH.

06:32.674 --> 06:35.709
WITH YOUR HAIR CUT SHORT LIKE THAT,
YOU KNOW WHO YOU LOOK EXACTLY LIKE?

06:36.478 --> 06:38.329
HALLE BERRY?

06:38.396 --> 06:41.399
FRANK MEDFORD.

06:42.701 --> 06:44.235
OK.

06:46.238 --> 06:48.173
HE RENTED A ROOM FROM
YOUR MOM AND I

06:48.240 --> 06:50.008
WHEN WE FIRST GOT MARRIED. OH, YEAH?

06:50.075 --> 06:52.409
HE WAS ALWAYS
VERY NICE TO YOUR MOTHER.

06:52.478 --> 06:53.544
HE...

06:53.612 --> 06:56.280
LOOKED AFTER HER WHEN
I WAS AWAY ON BUSINESS.

06:56.348 --> 07:01.151
HE MOVED OUT RATHER ABRUPTLY AROUND
THE TIME SHE GOT PREGNANT WITH YOU.

07:01.219 --> 07:04.204
OK, DADDY.
I LOVE YOU.

07:04.272 --> 07:06.324
I'LL CALL YOU
FROM THE BOAT.

07:09.561 --> 07:11.496
OH, DEAR GOD.

07:37.106 --> 07:40.424
HOW GREAT IS THIS? WE'RE HALFWAY
TO BARBADOS WITH OUR BEST FRIENDS,

07:40.492 --> 07:42.793
WE HAVE ROBERT
GOULET SINGING TO US.

07:42.861 --> 07:45.730
I MEAN, WHAT ELSE
CAN YOU ASK FOR?

07:45.797 --> 07:47.231
NOT A THING.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.806
WHAT, DEAC? YOU
WANNA CUT IN?

08:13.175 --> 08:16.010

HEY. HEY, ALL RIGHT.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.239

08:28.307 --> 08:29.274
RIGHT.

08:43.488 --> 08:45.072
HEY, ARTHUR.

08:45.140 --> 08:46.891

08:46.959 --> 08:50.278
YOU TOLD ME 10 MINUTES AGO AND
TOLD ME TO BE HERE IN 10 MINUTES.

08:50.346 --> 08:53.047
LET'S NOT WASTE MORE TIME

08:53.114 --> 08:54.799
OK. WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:54.867 --> 08:57.084
YOU SEE THAT MAN IN THERE? ... YEAH.

08:57.152 --> 09:01.039
I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE HE
MAY BE CARRIE'S REAL FATHER.

09:01.106 --> 09:03.107
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:03.175 --> 09:04.575
IT'S A LONG STORY.

09:04.643 --> 09:06.744
ACTUALLY, IT'S
PRETTY SHORT.

09:08.113 --> 09:11.082
I THINK HE BOINKED
CARRIE'S MOTHER.

09:13.018 --> 09:15.820
IF THERE WAS ONLY SOME WAY
I COULD KNOW FOR SURE.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.538
WELL, YOU COULD DO
A DNA TEST.

09:17.605 --> 09:20.374
YOU SEND IN SOME OF HER
HAIR, SOME OF HIS HAIR,

09:20.442 --> 09:22.176
YOU'D KNOW IN
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

09:22.244 --> 09:23.327
HOW AM I GONNA
GET HIS HAIR?

09:23.395 --> 09:24.995
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE HAIR. IT CAN BE...

09:25.063 --> 09:26.897
SALIVA, OR A
SKIN SAMPLE.

09:26.965 --> 09:27.832
SKIN SAMPLE, HUH?

09:27.899 --> 09:29.450
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

09:37.226 --> 09:38.843

10:32.531 --> 10:35.233
STOP! NO, HONEY.

10:35.300 --> 10:38.069
I ACTUALLY LIKE THE WIND

10:38.137 --> 10:39.503
FEELS GOOD.

10:39.571 --> 10:41.555
OK. WHAT'S THE MATTER?

10:41.623 --> 10:43.624
NAH. I OVER-BUFFETED. OH.

10:49.231 --> 10:52.032
I'M SLEEPING

10:52.100 --> 10:54.268
WE LOVED YOUR
SHOW TONIGHT.

10:54.336 --> 10:56.804
YEAH, AND I USUALLY HATE
THAT KIND OF CRAP.

10:56.872 --> 10:59.590
ISN'T THAT SWEET?

10:59.657 --> 11:01.892
ACTUALLY, WOULD YOU MIND IF
WE TOOK A PICTURE WITH YOU?

11:01.960 --> 11:06.230

CRAPPY MUSIC, WHY NOT?

11:06.297 --> 11:10.401
I'M JUST GONNA GO GET THE
CAMERA. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OK?

11:10.468 --> 11:11.903
BOY, THAT IS...

11:11.970 --> 11:15.106

11:15.173 --> 11:16.874
I JUST THOUGHT SHE'D LOOK
CUTE WITH SHORT HAIR, YOU KNOW?

11:16.942 --> 11:18.375
LIKE JAMIE
LEE CURTIS.

11:18.443 --> 11:22.213
OH, JAMIE LEE. I LOVE HER. WE
DID A "MUPPET" SPECIAL TOGETHER.

11:22.281 --> 11:26.650
SHE SANG A HAUNTING DUET
WITH FOZZIE BEAR.

11:26.718 --> 11:29.237
OH, WAIT. I HAVE MY
CAMERA RIGHT HERE.

11:35.994 --> 11:38.029
HEY.

11:42.167 --> 11:44.501
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
PINCH ME! NOW! PINCH ME!

11:44.569 --> 11:46.103
THAT'S CRAZY.

11:46.171 --> 11:48.155
WERE YOU TALKING
ABOUT MY HAIR?

11:48.223 --> 11:49.840
NO! NO.

11:49.908 --> 11:51.726
WAS HE MAKING FUN
OF MY HAIR?

11:51.793 --> 11:54.878
LOOK, I'M IN A HURRY. I'VE GOTTA
CALL BINGO IN THE BARRACUDA LOUNGE.

11:54.946 --> 11:56.714

11:56.782 --> 11:59.617
WAS HE MAKING FUN OF
MY HAIR OR NOT? WAS HE?

11:59.684 --> 12:02.920
HE SAYS YOU LOOK
LIKE PETE ROSE.

12:06.425 --> 12:08.125
PETE ROSE? HE'S THE ALL-TIME...

12:08.193 --> 12:09.827

12:11.246 --> 12:14.298
OH, BUDDY.
I'M SORRY. LOOK.

12:14.366 --> 12:17.268
DRINKS HALF PRICE AT
MY LATE SHOW, OK? SEE YA.

12:23.625 --> 12:25.692
CARRIE,
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

12:25.760 --> 12:27.344
I'M LEAVING.

12:27.412 --> 12:30.047
YOU DO REALIZE
WE'RE ON A BOAT.

12:30.115 --> 12:33.484
THEN I WILL SWIM. I HAVE
THE PERFECT HAIR FOR IT.

12:33.552 --> 12:37.371
COME ON! I SAW YOU AND
ROBERT GOULET LAUGHING

12:37.405 --> 12:39.573
AT HOW BAD
MY HAIR LOOKS.

12:39.641 --> 12:41.826
WE WEREN'T LAUGHING AT HOW BAD YOUR
HAIR LOOKS. WE WERE LAUGHING WITH...

12:41.893 --> 12:43.694
HOW BAD YOU HAIR LOOKS.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.863
I CAN'T BELIEVE I
CONVINCED MYSELF

12:45.931 --> 12:48.031
THAT THIS LOOKED
STYLISH AND SASSY.

12:48.099 --> 12:50.701
I LOOK LIKE
A MENTAL PATIENT!

12:50.769 --> 12:52.269
I KNOW. IT'S HARD. GET OFF ME!

12:52.337 --> 12:54.105
DON'T TOUCH ME!

12:54.173 --> 12:55.940
YOU KNOW HOW
HUMILIATED I AM?

12:56.008 --> 12:58.142
AND YOU TALKED ME
INTO THIS!

12:58.210 --> 12:59.460
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
GONNA LOOK SO BAD.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.362
HERE'S THE THING. YOUR
HAIR'S GONNA GROW BACK

13:01.429 --> 13:03.497
AND YOU NEVER HAVE
TO DO THIS AGAIN.

13:03.565 --> 13:06.032
ACTUALLY, ONE MORE TIME, 'CAUSE
THE PIZZA OVEN WAS PART OF THE DEAL.

13:07.402 --> 13:10.003
AAAH!

13:10.071 --> 13:12.607
LOOK, WE MADE A MISTAKE,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

13:12.674 --> 13:14.775
SHAVE YOUR HEAD.

13:15.561 --> 13:16.644
I'M NOT SHAVING
MY HEAD.

13:16.711 --> 13:19.163
WELL, SHAVE
SOMETHING, BABE.

13:19.231 --> 13:20.531
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.433
HOW ABOUT THAT WEIRD
PATCH ON YOUR BACK?

13:22.534 --> 13:24.151
OH. NO.
I NEED THAT.

13:27.889 --> 13:29.757
WE CAN STILL HAVE A
GOOD TIME, ALL RIGHT?

13:29.825 --> 13:31.993
WHY DON'T YOU
- HERE. THROW THIS SCARF ON,

13:32.060 --> 13:35.429
AND WE'LL GO MEET DEACON AND
KELLY AT THE MIDNIGHT BUFFET.

13:35.547 --> 13:38.216
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
UNTIL MY HAIR GROWS BACK.

13:40.285 --> 13:42.453
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? WE'RE
GONNA STAY HERE IN THE CABIN

13:42.520 --> 13:43.754
FOR THE REST
OF THE CRUISE?

13:43.822 --> 13:45.472
NOT WE.

13:51.863 --> 13:53.898
YOU GUYS GOT
AN EXTRA PILLOW?

13:56.384 --> 13:58.202
JUST ASKIN'.

14:06.161 --> 14:07.828
MMHM.

14:15.186 --> 14:16.637
HEY.

14:20.509 --> 14:23.744
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

14:23.812 --> 14:25.946
I'M SORRY.
IT WAS COLD, ALL RIGHT?

14:26.014 --> 14:28.014
WHERE'S KELLY?

14:28.082 --> 14:30.667
SHE LEFT. SHE GOT PRETTY
FREAKED OUT WHEN I GOT INTO BED.

14:30.735 --> 14:32.436
OH, MAN!

14:32.504 --> 14:34.105
I'VE REALLY BEEN LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS TRIP.

14:34.172 --> 14:36.908
NOW I'M STUCK IN BED WITH
YOU INSTEAD OF MY WIFE.

14:36.975 --> 14:38.392
WOMEN.

14:40.562 --> 14:44.965
SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE NO MATTER WHAT WE
DO, IT JUST ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM.

14:45.033 --> 14:46.233
DON'T LUMP US
TOGETHER.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.869
I SAVED UP MONEY FOR
6 MONTHS FOR THIS TRIP.

14:48.937 --> 14:51.405
YOU SOLD YOUR WIFE
FOR PARTS.

14:51.472 --> 14:53.473
I'M SORRY. WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

14:53.542 --> 14:55.843
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I GOT TWO MORE
DAYS ON THIS BOAT WITHOUT MY KIDS

14:55.911 --> 14:59.212
AND I PLAN ON GETTIN'
LUCKY, AND NOT WITH YOU.

14:59.280 --> 15:02.215
WELL, JUST FOR THAT
THE CANDY SHOP IS CLOSED.

15:04.553 --> 15:06.353
QUIT HOGGING
THE BLANKET.

15:08.757 --> 15:11.725
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME WAY
I CAN MAKE THIS BETTER.

15:11.793 --> 15:13.661
BUY HER A HAT, OR...

15:13.728 --> 15:15.295
A HELMET.

15:16.365 --> 15:17.765
HOW ABOUT A WIG?

15:17.833 --> 15:21.101
OK, WHERE AM I GONNA GET
HER A WIG ON A CRUISE SHIP?

15:21.169 --> 15:22.802
WHERE WERE YOU GONNA
GET A HELMET, IDIOT?

15:24.606 --> 15:27.174
WELL, NOW I SEE WHY
KELLY LEFT. I REALLY DO.

15:33.181 --> 15:34.681
Ok. Shhhh. You
gotta be fast.

15:34.750 --> 15:35.783
OK.

15:35.851 --> 15:39.153
LOOK, I REALLY APPRECIATE
THIS, MR. GOULET.

15:39.221 --> 15:40.504
OK. LOCK UP
ON YOUR WAY OUT.

15:40.572 --> 15:41.505
OK.

15:41.573 --> 15:42.540
ALL RIGHT.

15:42.607 --> 15:44.141
LET'S DO THIS AND
GET OUT OF HERE.

15:44.209 --> 15:46.477
WHERE'S THE WIGS?
WHERE'S THE WIGS?

15:46.545 --> 15:48.045

15:49.197 --> 15:52.232
HEY, MAN. HOW WOULD
I LOOK IF I WORE THIS?

15:53.818 --> 15:55.936
LOOKS LIKE YOU ATE
ELTON JOHN.

15:58.239 --> 15:58.922
COME ON.

15:58.990 --> 16:00.841
HERE WE ARE!
LOOK AT THIS!

16:00.908 --> 16:02.476
ALL RIGHT.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.145
WHAT DO YOU
THINK?

16:05.213 --> 16:06.447
THIS ONE
IS NICE.

16:06.514 --> 16:08.415
ALL RIGHT, WELL, PUT IT ON. WHAT?

16:08.483 --> 16:10.050
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

16:10.118 --> 16:12.152
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT YOU HERE,
SO I COULD SEE IT ON SOMEONE.

16:12.220 --> 16:15.522
TRUST ME, ANY WIG I PUT ON
I'M GONNA LOOK LIKE RICK JAMES.

16:18.493 --> 16:20.594
I GOT AN IDEA.

16:22.030 --> 16:23.163
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:23.231 --> 16:24.648
I'M DRAWING HER FACE.

16:27.769 --> 16:28.836
ALL RIGHT.

16:28.903 --> 16:30.504
HOW DOES THAT LOOK?

16:32.440 --> 16:35.525
I DON'T KNOW. IT DOESN'T
LOOK MUCH LIKE CARRIE.

16:36.344 --> 16:37.594
OH.

16:41.899 --> 16:45.068
NOW LOOK.
HOW DOES THAT LOOK?

16:45.136 --> 16:48.238
THERE SHE IS. YEAH.
YEAH.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.227
SO?

16:54.295 --> 16:55.896
WHAT ARE
THE RESULTS?

16:55.964 --> 16:59.483
I DON'T KNOW, SPENCE. I'VE
BEEN TOO NERVOUS TO OPEN IT.

16:59.551 --> 17:00.718
DO YOU WANT ME
TO LOOK?

17:00.802 --> 17:02.369
NO, I SHOULD
DO THIS.

17:11.980 --> 17:14.982
ACCORDING TO THIS,
THE FATHER IS...

17:16.917 --> 17:18.451
SPENCE OLCHIN.

17:18.519 --> 17:20.654
WHAT?!

17:20.722 --> 17:22.823
YOU BASTARD!

17:22.891 --> 17:26.093
THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE. YEAH!

17:26.161 --> 17:28.211
THE MISTAKE WAS LETTING
YOU ANYWHERE NEAR MY WIFE!

17:28.279 --> 17:30.714
I'VE NEVER MET
YOUR WIFE

17:30.782 --> 17:32.283
AND I'M ONLY 2 YEARS OLDER THAN CARRIE.

17:32.350 --> 17:35.168
OH, LOOK AT YOU,
YOU'RE 50 IF YOU'RE A DAY!

17:37.322 --> 17:40.924
OK, ARTHUR, THE REASON MY NAME
IS ON THIS IS BECAUSE I'M THE ONE

17:40.992 --> 17:42.293
WHO PAID FOR THE TEST!

17:42.360 --> 17:46.664

17:50.902 --> 17:53.069
"FRANK MEDFORD

17:53.137 --> 17:55.071
YOU'RE CARRIE'S FATHER.

17:55.139 --> 17:56.757
WELL, THAT'S
PRETTY ANTICLIMACTIC.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.243
I'M GONNA GRAB A NAP.

18:07.602 --> 18:10.804

YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT,

19:38.076 --> 19:40.411
NOW I LOOK FANTASTIC
AND YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

19:40.478 --> 19:42.746
I WOULDN'T SAY "FANTASTIC." OH.

19:42.814 --> 19:45.866
