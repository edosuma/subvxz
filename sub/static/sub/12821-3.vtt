<i>Previously on "Zero Hour"...</i>

00:06.506 --> 00:08.138
They're breaking in!

00:08.173 --> 00:10.341
We know quite a bit about
who might have her...

00:10.376 --> 00:12.210
The highest-end mercenary
in the world.

00:12.244 --> 00:13.378
It's about a clock.

00:13.413 --> 00:16.146
1938, the church appoints
12 new apostles

00:16.181 --> 00:18.716
and trusts them with
the ultimate secret,

00:18.750 --> 00:20.017
and it's hidden in these clocks.

00:20.051 --> 00:22.753
I solve this, I find Laila.

00:22.788 --> 00:25.188
(Arron) The guy in the sub,
he looked like you?

00:25.223 --> 00:28.191
He looked <i>exactly</i> like me.

00:28.226 --> 00:30.294
How did you end up
working for the FBI?

00:30.328 --> 00:31.629
Plane blows up on
the other side of the planet.

00:31.663 --> 00:33.263
You're husband's on it,

00:33.298 --> 00:34.997
and suddenly you just wanna put
a bullet in the bomber's head.

00:35.032 --> 00:36.999
Laila!
Hank!

00:37.034 --> 00:38.200
I'll find you!

Which way?

01:16.438 --> 01:18.439
Ping off Vincent's cell
puts them on this floor.

01:19.575 --> 01:20.875
Laila?

01:32.386 --> 01:33.553
Laila!

01:33.588 --> 01:35.288
Laila?

01:35.322 --> 01:36.790
(Whispers) Oh, Hank.
Are you all right?

01:36.824 --> 01:38.757
Hank. We need to get
her to a hospital.

01:38.792 --> 01:40.493
You have to stop.

01:40.527 --> 01:42.194
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not.

01:42.228 --> 01:43.696
Hank, he's coming back.

01:43.730 --> 01:45.764
You don't have to worry about
Vincent. The FBI's here.

01:45.799 --> 01:47.165
You don't understand.

01:47.200 --> 01:51.804
(Thudding)

01:59.578 --> 02:00.979
(Whispers) He's coming back.

02:03.448 --> 02:04.949
(Glass shatters)

02:06.919 --> 02:10.020
(Panting)

02:10.054 --> 02:11.788
<i>(Man over P.A.) Folks, in just</i>
<i>a moment, we will prepare</i>

02:11.823 --> 02:14.658
<i>for our final descent</i>
<i>into New York City.</i>

02:16.293 --> 02:19.162
Planes.

02:19.196 --> 02:20.931
Must be hard.

02:23.735 --> 02:27.403
W-when someone you love
dies of a heart attack,

02:27.437 --> 02:30.105
you exercise,
you... you eat better.

02:30.140 --> 02:34.510
When they die in a car accident,
you make sure to buckle up.

02:34.545 --> 02:39.314
But when they're murdered?

02:39.349 --> 02:40.482
There's only one thing
you can do

02:40.517 --> 02:42.350
to prevent that
from happening again.

02:42.384 --> 02:45.554
Once we find Laila,

02:45.588 --> 02:48.122
you can do whatever you want
with Vincent. How about that?

02:50.426 --> 02:54.729
Okay. Uh, let's think about
what we know.

02:54.764 --> 02:56.230
Vincent's after these clocks.

02:56.265 --> 02:58.899
And these clocks, they seem
to have a map in them.

02:58.934 --> 03:01.035
Which leads to what, exactly?

03:01.069 --> 03:05.072
I don't know,
and I-I don't care.

03:06.507 --> 03:09.843
I just wanna find out
where he's keeping her.

03:09.878 --> 03:13.813
Maybe the better question
is "why?"

03:13.847 --> 03:16.382
Vincent has never
kept a hostage alive.

03:16.416 --> 03:17.550
<i>Ever.</i>

03:17.585 --> 03:21.187
So why Laila?

03:26.426 --> 03:30.829
I need you to fix this.

03:30.863 --> 03:33.398
The pieces inside are loose.

03:33.432 --> 03:35.200
But each piece

03:35.234 --> 03:38.837
had numbers and letters
inscribed on them.

03:38.871 --> 03:41.439
Clearly a puzzle
waiting to be solved

03:41.474 --> 03:45.110
when the gears rotate
into place...

03:45.144 --> 03:47.479
Something that is not possible

03:47.513 --> 03:50.681
in the clock's
current condition.

03:50.716 --> 03:54.185
You <i>are</i> going to help me.

03:54.220 --> 03:57.155
I know this because...

03:58.824 --> 04:03.026
When I'm halfway through
removing the ears of a person

04:03.060 --> 04:05.262
using only a butter knife,

04:05.296 --> 04:09.566
they do whatever it is I ask.

04:09.601 --> 04:12.736
I would prefer to skip
this step with you, Laila.

04:12.770 --> 04:15.772
Would you also prefer this?

04:18.408 --> 04:19.875
Good.

04:21.211 --> 04:24.847
The clothes you have been
wearing have taken on a...

04:24.881 --> 04:26.349
colorful odor.

04:29.453 --> 04:32.455
For you. Voila.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.289
Put it on.

04:34.323 --> 04:35.723
I won't peek.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.801
When we're on the move,

04:46.835 --> 04:50.437
we should appear
as a happy couple

04:50.472 --> 04:52.839
out for a stroll.

04:52.874 --> 04:55.543
If I help you,

04:55.577 --> 04:58.279
are you gonna return me safely
to my husband?

04:58.313 --> 04:59.880
Your husband,

04:59.914 --> 05:01.882
I find him...

05:01.916 --> 05:04.718
quite curious.

05:04.752 --> 05:06.186
(Zips dress) Perhaps we
can discuss this tonight

05:06.220 --> 05:09.021
over duck
and a bottle of Dornfelder.

05:09.056 --> 05:10.890
I'm gonna need parts and tools.

05:18.131 --> 05:20.766
(Rachel) Laila?
You saw her in India?

05:20.801 --> 05:22.101
How did she look?

05:22.135 --> 05:24.670
Well, she was alive,
which is all that matters.

05:24.704 --> 05:26.938
Yeah, but Vincent's got
the clock, and we got nada.

05:26.972 --> 05:28.973
So how are we gonna figure out
where they're headed?

05:29.008 --> 05:30.409
I'm still working on that.

05:30.443 --> 05:32.411
You know, I need you to work
on something.

05:32.445 --> 05:35.980
When we were in India, someone
tried to kill us... a priest.

05:36.015 --> 05:37.148
What?

05:37.183 --> 05:38.849
Yeah, he was wearing
the rose cross.

05:38.883 --> 05:40.384
Wait. Last time I checked
my program,

05:40.419 --> 05:42.486
the Rosicrucians were supposed
to be the good guys.

05:42.521 --> 05:44.355
So what does that make us?

05:44.389 --> 05:46.924
In trouble.

05:55.366 --> 05:56.466
Did you guys lock up
last night?

05:56.500 --> 05:58.869
Yeah. I was the last one out.

05:58.903 --> 06:00.871
Wait here. (Mouths word)

06:13.550 --> 06:14.683
(Gun cocks)

06:14.718 --> 06:16.819
Don't move. Not even an inch.

06:16.854 --> 06:19.521
Relax, Agent Willis.

06:19.556 --> 06:21.057
This is Mr. Galliston,
not the target.

06:21.091 --> 06:23.559
You wanna tell me why
you've broken into my office?

06:23.593 --> 06:26.262
Oh, we didn't break in.
The janitor let us in.

06:26.296 --> 06:29.164
The janitor opened the door.
The warrant let us in.

06:29.198 --> 06:32.100
The thought is, Vincent might
try to make contact again.

06:32.135 --> 06:33.802
We need to be here if he does.

06:33.836 --> 06:36.504
And given what we encountered
in India,

06:36.538 --> 06:38.673
to have some people with guns
watching your back

06:38.707 --> 06:40.275
might not be such a bad idea.

06:40.309 --> 06:44.078
I'll ask that you sit tight now.
We'll handle it from here.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.180
The Bureau's been "handling"
Vincent for the last six years.

06:46.214 --> 06:48.182
How's that goin'?

06:48.216 --> 06:49.516
(Beck) Terrence...

06:50.852 --> 06:53.087
I appreciate
you signing off on this,

06:53.121 --> 06:54.789
but you have got to let me
do it my way.

06:54.823 --> 06:56.356
I am so close.

06:56.391 --> 06:58.392
Yeah, maybe <i>that's</i> the problem.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.261
Catch him this time.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.867
Agent Willis, we online?

07:07.902 --> 07:09.302
Facial recognition package
is keyed wide

07:09.336 --> 07:11.470
on Laila Galliston
and White Vincent.

07:11.505 --> 07:14.640
Either one of them crosses
our 460,000 cameras

07:14.675 --> 07:18.743
globally networked on
our system, we'll see it here.

07:27.620 --> 07:29.855
What did you mean earlier
when you said that...

07:29.889 --> 07:31.022
(Metal clanks)

07:31.056 --> 07:33.590
You were curious
about my husband?

07:33.625 --> 07:35.626
What if I told you
I met a man recently,

07:35.660 --> 07:38.429
the spitting image
of Hank Galliston?

07:38.463 --> 07:39.663
Would that surprise you?

07:39.698 --> 07:42.333
What do you mean?
Like a doppelganger?

07:42.367 --> 07:44.668
In one of the older issues
of your husband's magazine,

07:44.703 --> 07:48.038
he wrote an article
about doppelgangers,

07:48.072 --> 07:52.075
scientifically disproving
the viability of the phenomena.

07:52.109 --> 07:53.410
Well, Hank doesn't believe

07:53.445 --> 07:55.912
anything that he can't see
for himself.

07:55.947 --> 08:00.250
(European siren wailing
in distance)

08:00.284 --> 08:04.787
Perhaps he saw things recently
that makes him a believer.

08:08.125 --> 08:11.127
(Click, whirs)

08:12.395 --> 08:14.063
(Sighs) It's fixed.

08:17.868 --> 08:22.504
"P-R-6-4-2."

08:22.538 --> 08:24.340
P-R-6-4-2.

08:24.374 --> 08:26.375
Does that mean anything to you?

08:26.409 --> 08:28.809
That means...

08:28.844 --> 08:32.212
I know where we're headed.

08:32.248 --> 08:36.217
(Man) If anybody can survive
an ordeal like this, it's Laila.

08:36.251 --> 08:37.852
She's always been so strong.

08:37.886 --> 08:40.154
Remember your wedding,

08:40.188 --> 08:41.822
how everything that could
go wrong did?

08:41.857 --> 08:43.691
And she smiled
through the whole thing.

08:43.725 --> 08:46.026
(Chuckles) Thank you.

08:46.060 --> 08:48.362
I-I really appreciate
you guys coming down.

08:48.396 --> 08:51.331
You know, I did have a question
I was hoping you could answer.

08:51.366 --> 08:55.468
(Sighs)
Do we have any family...

08:55.503 --> 08:56.803
In Germany?

08:56.837 --> 09:00.606
Like, someone from
grandpa's generation?

09:00.640 --> 09:02.708
Not that I can think of.

09:02.742 --> 09:04.676
Is this
for one of your stories?

09:04.711 --> 09:06.745
No, it's...

09:06.780 --> 09:10.249
It's just, I saw something...
Some... some... <i>Someone</i>

09:10.284 --> 09:13.485
who, uh, looked like
he could've been related.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.520
(Arron) We got a hit!
(Computer beeping)

09:14.554 --> 09:16.321
Excuse me.

09:16.355 --> 09:17.555
(Hank) W-where is this?

09:17.589 --> 09:18.856
(Willis) Paris, nine hours ago.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.758
A security camera
caught them exiting a hotel.

09:20.793 --> 09:23.461
I'll have the Bureau notify
the F.A.A., monitor the trains.

09:23.495 --> 09:24.896
W-wait. Stop. Right there.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.464
(Clicks button)
Okay, roll it back.

09:26.498 --> 09:27.465
(Clicks button)

09:27.499 --> 09:28.666
Freeze.
(Clicks button)

09:30.036 --> 09:32.002
All right.

09:32.037 --> 09:33.203
What is it?

09:33.238 --> 09:35.172
Find out
what room they're in...

09:35.206 --> 09:36.673
(Dials, phone rings)
And send somebody there

09:36.707 --> 09:39.843
to look under every tabletop,
counter, desk, everything.

09:39.877 --> 09:40.877
Wanna tell us why?

09:44.649 --> 09:46.083
Just relax.

09:46.117 --> 09:47.284
You're gonna do great.

09:47.319 --> 09:49.018
I'm about to tell a packed room

09:49.053 --> 09:50.286
at a U.F.O. convention

09:50.321 --> 09:52.388
that there's no such thing
as a U.F.O.

09:52.423 --> 09:54.991
I know!
It's gonna be awesome!

09:55.025 --> 09:56.592
Okay, listen,
just remember two things.

09:56.626 --> 09:59.062
One, spit out your gum
before you talk.

09:59.096 --> 10:01.664
And two, of all the people
out there,

10:01.698 --> 10:03.899
you, Hank Galliston,
have the hottest wife.

10:03.934 --> 10:05.633
(Chuckles) - That's true...
(Whispers) - Yeah.

10:05.668 --> 10:07.102
But, you know, I'm probably
the only one out there

10:07.136 --> 10:08.270
who's actually touched
a girl...

10:08.304 --> 10:10.038
(Laughs)
So... it's not saying much.

10:10.073 --> 10:11.706
(Man, amplified voice)
Please welcome

10:11.740 --> 10:14.042
our next speaker this evening... Mr.
Hank Galliston.

10:14.077 --> 10:16.178
(Applause)

10:29.191 --> 10:31.125
I-I used to chew a lot of gum
when I was nervous,

10:31.159 --> 10:32.960
and I'd forget to spit it out.

10:32.995 --> 10:34.828
So we developed a sign,

10:34.863 --> 10:38.198
<i>and she would remind me,</i>
<i>i would take it out,</i>

10:38.232 --> 10:41.401
<i>and I would stick it</i>
<i>under the desk.</i>

10:44.238 --> 10:47.207
<i>Regardez. 
J'ai trouvé ça</i>

10:47.241 --> 10:48.741
(Beep)

10:48.775 --> 10:51.144
<i>Oui, nous avons trouvé 
quelque chose d'intéressant.</i>

10:52.712 --> 10:54.480
Okay, got it.

10:54.514 --> 10:57.049
"PR642."

10:57.083 --> 10:58.350
It was cared under the desk.

10:58.385 --> 11:00.185
Does that mean anything to you?

11:00.220 --> 11:02.054
I-I don't think so.

11:02.088 --> 11:04.423
I got a washer and a dryer part
number... pr642.

11:04.457 --> 11:06.625
Model number for
a steel folding pocketknife,

11:06.659 --> 11:08.059
some brake pads.

11:08.093 --> 11:10.694
No, we gotta stop thinking about
what the clues mean today.

11:10.729 --> 11:12.263
I mean, if it came from
the clock,

11:12.297 --> 11:16.867
we need to think about what
"PR642" means in 1938.

11:16.902 --> 11:18.302
It's a phone number.

11:18.337 --> 11:20.738
(Telephone rings in distance)

11:20.772 --> 11:22.973
Uh, PR642.

11:23.008 --> 11:24.174
Right up through the '40s,

11:24.208 --> 11:25.542
phone numbers didn't have
seven digits.

11:25.576 --> 11:27.110
(Typing) Everything went
through a central exchange...

11:27.145 --> 11:29.146
The first two letters
of the city

11:29.180 --> 11:30.647
followed by a 3-number code.

11:30.681 --> 11:32.549
I don't have a "who"
but I have a "where."

11:32.583 --> 11:36.086
The exchange "PR" means we're
looking for someone in...

11:36.120 --> 11:40.089
(Chuckles) Get this...
Princeton, New Jersey.

11:40.123 --> 11:44.660
We don't need to find the clock
to know where Vincent's going.

11:44.694 --> 11:46.529
Laila is gonna lead us there.

11:48.298 --> 11:51.567
♪

12:03.517 --> 12:04.817
Beck and I are gonna track down

12:04.937 --> 12:06.885
who that phone number
belonged to back in '38.

12:06.919 --> 12:09.086
And get to them before Vincent does.
I'll call you.

12:09.121 --> 12:11.356
You wanna tell us what
the hell's going on here, son?

12:11.390 --> 12:15.226
No, I can't. I'll... I'll call you
later, okay? I love you, guys.

12:15.261 --> 12:17.295
Listen, I'll... I'll make sure
they get home safe.

12:17.329 --> 12:21.198
Uh, then there's some people
I know who might be able

12:21.233 --> 12:23.767
to shed some light
on the Rosicrucians,

12:23.801 --> 12:26.703
help us figure out what the hell
their role is in all this.

12:26.738 --> 12:27.871
Thank you.

12:27.905 --> 12:29.038
Where you heading?

12:29.073 --> 12:30.206
The only place in Princeton

12:30.241 --> 12:31.875
that has phone records
from 1938.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.649
Over here.

12:38.683 --> 12:41.350
You seem to know your way around
this place.

12:41.385 --> 12:44.620
Well, I've been here before.

12:46.323 --> 12:47.723
This way.

12:50.694 --> 12:53.529
1938.

13:10.913 --> 13:12.245
Hmm.

13:15.249 --> 13:17.418
(Speaks indistinctly) P-R...

13:17.452 --> 13:20.120
PR642.

13:21.690 --> 13:23.691
Well, that's a bingo.

13:25.527 --> 13:26.893
Who do you think's
at that address?

13:26.928 --> 13:30.396
Are you ever gonna tell me
what this is all about?

13:30.431 --> 13:32.465
You mean the clocks?

13:32.499 --> 13:34.367
I could be more helpful to you
if I knew what...

13:34.401 --> 13:37.570
Don't mistake
my asking for your help

13:37.604 --> 13:39.038
as me <i>needing</i> your help.

13:39.072 --> 13:41.974
If you don't need my help,
then why am I still here?

13:42.008 --> 13:43.608
You're a smart lady.
You'll figure it out.

13:57.256 --> 13:58.990
(Door closes)

13:59.024 --> 14:02.226
Listen, we know that Hank's
gonna try to keep us in the dark

14:02.260 --> 14:03.927
to keep us from worrying.

14:03.962 --> 14:06.964
But I would ask that if
something's going on,

14:06.998 --> 14:09.266
something that a mother
and father should know,

14:09.300 --> 14:10.901
that you'll tell us.

14:10.935 --> 14:15.705
Hank rarely seeks the counsel
of his <i>Heavenly</i> Father either,

14:15.740 --> 14:18.908
so I wouldn't
take it personally.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.510
Appreciate that.

14:20.544 --> 14:22.545
Take care.

14:32.655 --> 14:35.090
So... (Sighs)

14:37.827 --> 14:39.661
What do we tell them?

14:40.897 --> 14:43.565
Nothing... yet.

14:57.678 --> 14:58.812
<i>(Man on TV)</i>
<i>The devastation here</i>

14:58.846 --> 15:00.480
<i>is absolutely unprecedented</i>

15:00.515 --> 15:02.917
<i>as wildfires continue to rage</i>
<i>in the pacific northwest.</i>

15:02.951 --> 15:04.651

15:12.259 --> 15:14.227
The page has been ripped out.

15:14.261 --> 15:16.996
God. He's been here already,
the son of a bitch.

15:17.031 --> 15:18.898
The trail's dry again.

15:20.534 --> 15:21.634
No, it's not.

15:21.668 --> 15:23.636
Well, how do you know?

15:23.670 --> 15:24.971
Laila's telling us.

15:28.308 --> 15:31.643
Okay. (Hums)
(Laughing) You're crazy.

15:33.446 --> 15:35.948
"The joy of sex"...

15:35.982 --> 15:37.115
"Of mice and men."

15:37.150 --> 15:39.084
<i>That's</i>
your literary mash-up?

15:39.118 --> 15:40.252
That's genius.

15:40.286 --> 15:41.420
(Laughs) Yeah,
unless you're the mouse.

15:41.454 --> 15:42.787
(Laughs)
What do you have for me?

15:42.822 --> 15:45.222
Turn around. Get ready.

15:45.257 --> 15:46.390
(Whispers) Okay.

15:46.425 --> 15:48.960
(Both humming)

15:48.994 --> 15:50.294
Mm.
Okay.

15:50.329 --> 15:51.829
"Everyone poops"...
Mm-hmm.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.697
"On the road"...

15:53.731 --> 15:55.499
(Laughs) "Far from
the maddening crowd."

15:55.533 --> 15:57.435
Yes! Three titles.
I totally win.

15:57.469 --> 15:58.602
You totally cheated.

15:58.636 --> 16:00.070
"Everyone poops" is not
in this section.

16:00.104 --> 16:02.772
Oh, come on.
Points for creativity.

16:06.310 --> 16:07.944
Ugh.

16:07.979 --> 16:09.846
I know that look.
That's your skeptic face.

16:09.880 --> 16:12.782
I just keep... waiting.

16:12.816 --> 16:14.817
For what?

16:14.852 --> 16:16.051
The other shoe to drop.

16:18.754 --> 16:19.888
What are you doing?

16:19.922 --> 16:21.590
Just do it. You, too.

16:21.624 --> 16:23.192
We're in the middle of a library.
(Loudly) Just do it.

16:23.226 --> 16:24.860
Shh!

16:24.894 --> 16:26.128
(Whispers) Sorry.

16:27.597 --> 16:29.598
(Boots thud)

16:29.632 --> 16:31.632
(Sneakers thud)

16:33.869 --> 16:36.971
See? Nothing happened.

16:37.006 --> 16:38.506
We're still here...

16:38.540 --> 16:39.707
(Whispers) Together.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.982
It's a game we used to play.

16:49.017 --> 16:52.585
"I," "a," "s."

16:52.620 --> 16:53.920
(Typing)

16:53.954 --> 16:56.656
Uh, we got a lot
of options here, Hank.

16:56.690 --> 16:58.225
"I.A.S." Could be anything.

16:58.259 --> 16:59.926
Indian Administration Service.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.528
(Willis)
Integrated Appliance Solutions.

17:01.562 --> 17:05.830
International Association
of Sufism.

17:05.865 --> 17:08.267
Okay, it's probably not
<i>that</i> one.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.969
I got it.
Institute for Advanced Study.

17:11.003 --> 17:13.839
"Found in 1930,
I.A.S. Is dedicated to

17:13.873 --> 17:15.540
"the original,
often speculative thinking

17:15.575 --> 17:17.175
"that produces
advances in knowledge

17:17.210 --> 17:19.544
that change the way
we understand the world."

17:19.578 --> 17:21.579
Oh, that sounds apostle-ish.

17:21.613 --> 17:23.381
Guess where it's located.

17:23.415 --> 17:26.050
Princeton, New Jersey.

17:26.085 --> 17:29.087
(Bell tolling)

17:34.293 --> 17:36.260
Some of the world's
foremost thinkers

17:36.294 --> 17:39.829
did their greatest work here...

17:39.864 --> 17:42.366
Kurt Godel,

17:42.400 --> 17:45.536
Robert Oppenheimer.

17:45.570 --> 17:47.538
You don't approve of his work?

17:47.572 --> 17:50.907
No one should create something
they can't control.

17:50.942 --> 17:52.775
Tell that to God.

18:03.454 --> 18:06.289
If you dialed "Princeton 642"
in 1938,

18:06.323 --> 18:09.391
it would ring on the other side
of this door.

18:09.425 --> 18:12.694
But the question is,
who would answer it?

18:12.728 --> 18:14.963
After you.

18:17.300 --> 18:18.933
(Hank) Excuse me. Have you seen
either of these people?

18:18.968 --> 18:20.702
Have either of you seen these
two people on campus today?

18:20.736 --> 18:22.036
(Hank) They may have been
together as a couple.

18:22.071 --> 18:24.605
I'm looking for a couple.

18:24.639 --> 18:27.674
(Cell phone rings)

18:27.709 --> 18:29.076
Beck.

18:29.111 --> 18:30.511
(Man) Student says he saw
the targets enter an office

18:30.545 --> 18:32.946
on the first floor of fuld hall
about ten minutes ago.

18:32.981 --> 18:35.048
Come on.

18:39.453 --> 18:40.620
(Mouths words)

18:46.827 --> 18:48.128
What the hell?!

18:48.162 --> 18:50.930
- Anyone in here with you?
(Man) - No.

18:50.964 --> 18:54.134
Have you seen
either of these two people?

18:54.168 --> 18:57.836
Yeah. They were just here
about ten minutes ago.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.605
(Beck whispers) - Go.
- What were they looking for?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.640
The same thing everybody else
is looking for

19:01.674 --> 19:02.974
when they stumble
into this office...

19:03.009 --> 19:04.343
The guy who used to work here.

19:04.377 --> 19:07.179
Who is that?

19:07.213 --> 19:09.314
Albert Einstein.

19:22.684 --> 19:24.018
<i>(Man on newsreel) In January,</i>

19:24.052 --> 19:25.886
<i>nobel prize mathematician</i>
<i>Albert Einstein</i>

19:25.920 --> 19:27.087
<i>visited California.</i>

19:27.122 --> 19:29.089
<i>Ten months later,</i>
<i>he was in exile,</i>

19:29.124 --> 19:31.959
<i>his property seized</i>
<i>by Hitler's new regime.</i>

19:31.993 --> 19:33.827
<i>Germany's loss, America's gain.</i>

19:33.862 --> 19:35.094
(Arron) Albert Einstein?

19:35.129 --> 19:38.665
Jewish, crazy hair,
kinda smart Albert Einstein

19:38.699 --> 19:40.399
was one of the new apostles?

19:40.433 --> 19:41.668
That's the theory.

19:41.702 --> 19:43.102
(Rachel) You know, it might be
more than a theory.

19:43.137 --> 19:44.871
I'm just reading
a quote of his that says,

19:44.905 --> 19:46.205
"only the church stood

19:46.239 --> 19:48.407
"squarely across the path
of Hitler's campaign.

19:48.441 --> 19:49.742
<i>"I never had</i>

19:49.777 --> 19:50.976
<i>"any special interest</i>
<i>in the church before,</i>

19:51.010 --> 19:53.378
<i>"but now I feel</i>
<i>a great affection</i>

19:53.412 --> 19:55.613
<i>"because the church alone</i>
<i>has had the courage</i>

19:55.648 --> 19:58.516
<i>to stand for intellectual truth</i>
<i>and moral freedom."</i>

19:58.551 --> 20:00.251
<i>(Hank)</i>
<i>So like the other apostles,</i>

20:00.286 --> 20:02.888
he would've been given a clock
to protect.

20:02.922 --> 20:04.255
Where is it?

20:04.290 --> 20:06.424
Figure that out, and we know
where Vincent's going next.

20:06.458 --> 20:08.659
Here's a photograph
from "Life" magazine,

20:08.694 --> 20:11.943
taken in Einstein's office
at I.A.S. the day the died.

20:12.063 --> 20:13.363
Any sign of a clock?

20:13.398 --> 20:16.099
(Willis) - Not in this photo.
(Rachel) - Well, it says here,

20:16.133 --> 20:18.034
in accordance with Einstein's
wishes, his office and his home

20:18.069 --> 20:20.237
were not preserved
for a memorial for his work.

20:20.271 --> 20:23.406
However, the historical society
of Princeton is developing

20:23.440 --> 20:24.674
an exhibition featuring

20:24.708 --> 20:25.874
some of Einstein's
personal possessions...

20:25.909 --> 20:27.843
His favorite armchair,
his wooden music stand,

20:27.877 --> 20:29.679
his pipe, and... get this...

20:29.713 --> 20:32.915
His treasured Biedermeir-style
grandfather clock.

20:32.949 --> 20:35.084
Find out where it's stored.

20:35.118 --> 20:36.586
(Bell tolls, card shuffle)

20:36.620 --> 20:39.387
(Man) Five card. Nothing wild.

20:39.422 --> 20:42.524
I like it.
Traditional game.

20:42.558 --> 20:44.859
None of this hold'em crap
you see on TV.

20:44.893 --> 20:48.463
Jack high bets.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.965
That's you, Mickle.

20:50.999 --> 20:54.703
Brothers,
can I ask you something?

20:54.737 --> 20:57.804
Are any of you aware
of a sect of Rosicrucians

20:57.872 --> 21:04.010
who fled Nazi Germany but are
still actively operating today

21:04.045 --> 21:06.347
"actively operating"?

21:06.381 --> 21:09.916
That's a rather odd question,
Mickle.

21:09.951 --> 21:14.520
A good friend of mine's
tangled up in a... situation.

21:14.555 --> 21:18.791
He says a man
carrying the rose cross

21:18.792 --> 21:24.096
tried to take his life in India
a few days ago.

21:24.131 --> 21:25.665
What?

21:25.666 --> 21:27.899
That doesn't make any sense.

21:27.967 --> 21:29.167
Rosicrusians,

21:29.235 --> 21:32.371
while outside the circle
of traditional christianity,

21:32.405 --> 21:34.805
are by nature a peaceful order,

21:34.839 --> 21:38.041
dedicated to spreading the
gospel and healing the sick.

21:38.042 --> 21:40.878
The situation you say your-
your friend is tangled up in,

21:40.912 --> 21:42.045
does it have anything to do

21:42.080 --> 21:44.615
with why <i>you</i> ended up
in the hospital?

21:47.486 --> 21:49.820
Perhaps.

21:49.854 --> 21:54.258
Have you considered that, uh,
maybe this good friend of yours

21:54.325 --> 21:56.160
isn't as good as you think?

22:06.005 --> 22:09.621
(Beck) We're too late.
Vincent's already been here.

22:11.575 --> 22:12.909
How long?

22:12.944 --> 22:14.845
Less than 30.

22:14.879 --> 22:17.681
(White Vincent) Apologies.

22:17.715 --> 22:21.084
I'm a few minutes late.

22:21.119 --> 22:23.418
I have the first three clocks.

22:28.358 --> 22:30.126
Tell her it's just
a matter of time

22:30.160 --> 22:32.294
till she has
the object she seeks.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.584
Excuse me.
Are you reading "Disinfo"?

22:57.618 --> 22:58.752
Yeah. You know it?

22:58.787 --> 23:00.087
Know it?
It's like porn to me.

23:00.121 --> 23:01.722
Me, too. (Chuckles)
(Chuckles)

23:01.756 --> 23:03.223
I mean, not the porn part.

23:03.257 --> 23:04.958
Yeah, no, I-I'm not...
Me neither.

23:04.993 --> 23:07.795
I don't...
I'm not into porn.

23:07.829 --> 23:08.962
(Under breath) God.

23:08.997 --> 23:11.297
I was actually just reading
some back issues

23:11.331 --> 23:12.498
on some stuff about Einstein,

23:12.532 --> 23:14.033
and there's apparently
all this speculation

23:14.068 --> 23:16.135
about what he was really
working on before he died.

23:16.170 --> 23:18.204
Did you see the stuff about
the blackboard in his office?

23:18.238 --> 23:19.939
It was the last thing
he was working on

23:19.973 --> 23:22.374
before he was taken
to the hospital.

23:22.409 --> 23:24.543
The... there's this part
right here

23:24.578 --> 23:26.945
that he mysteriously erased
before he left.

23:26.979 --> 23:28.279
There's theories that
before he died,

23:28.314 --> 23:30.315
Einstein discovered something,

23:30.349 --> 23:32.784
an equation that would create
a new form of power,

23:32.819 --> 23:35.286
but he thought that the people
weren't ready for it.

23:35.321 --> 23:37.989
So he erased it so no one
would know what it was.

23:38.024 --> 23:41.793
(Vibrating)

23:41.828 --> 23:43.227
Hey, Hank.

23:43.261 --> 23:45.930
Did you... did you...
did you find...

23:45.964 --> 23:47.798
(Clicks button)

23:47.833 --> 23:49.133
I'm sorry, man.

23:49.167 --> 23:51.468
Hey, Rach, you can stand down
on that clock research.

23:51.502 --> 23:53.670
Vincent already found it.

23:53.705 --> 23:55.305
- No, he didn't.
- What?

23:55.340 --> 23:56.473
Put it on speaker.

23:56.507 --> 23:57.541
(Beep)

23:57.575 --> 23:58.908
Vincent doesn't have the clock.

23:58.943 --> 24:00.610
(Hank) How do you know?

24:00.644 --> 24:02.511
Because the Biedermeir
was built in the 1800s,

24:02.546 --> 24:05.115
and it's been in Einstein's
family for generations.

24:05.149 --> 24:06.449
That means there's no way

24:06.483 --> 24:08.384
the church could've
given it to him in 1938.

24:08.418 --> 24:09.919
So where's the real one?

24:09.954 --> 24:11.387
He must've hidden it somewhere

24:11.421 --> 24:13.689
because he knew he was
going to die.

24:13.724 --> 24:16.759
He refused surgery, saying,
"I want to go when I want."

24:16.793 --> 24:19.828
<i>"It is tasteless</i>
<i>to prolong life artificially."</i>

24:19.948 --> 24:22.965
<i>"I have done my share. It is time to go.
I will do it elegantly."</i>

24:22.999 --> 24:24.166
<i>As an apostle,</i>

24:24.200 --> 24:27.535
he knew he had to protect
the clock.

24:27.570 --> 24:30.272
So he must've hid it somewhere
where no one could find it.

24:32.507 --> 24:34.175
The erased part
of the blackboard.

24:34.209 --> 24:36.543
Einstein hid it
in the only place

24:36.578 --> 24:39.147
he knew it couldn't fall
into the wrong hands.

24:41.750 --> 24:44.618
His mind.

24:44.653 --> 24:46.754
<i>(Ticking)</i>

24:56.040 --> 24:57.640
(Click, whirring)

24:57.675 --> 24:59.509
(Types)

24:59.543 --> 25:01.678
(Beeps) (Rachel) So what
exactly is this thing?

25:01.712 --> 25:04.381
It's
an electromagnetic spectrometer.

25:04.415 --> 25:07.884
Basically what's gonna happen is
the photoelectron spectroscopy

25:07.918 --> 25:10.552
will bounce x-rays off
the surface of the board.

25:10.587 --> 25:11.954
And then
based on the reflection,

25:11.989 --> 25:13.289
the machine should be able
to line map

25:13.323 --> 25:15.458
the chemical composition
on the atomic level.

25:15.492 --> 25:18.127
Then we'll be able to read what
was erased from the blackboard.

25:18.161 --> 25:20.296
Yeah, that's...
pretty much

25:20.330 --> 25:22.031
what I figured
was going on right there.

25:22.065 --> 25:25.066
(Police radio chatter)

25:27.636 --> 25:30.305
So... I've been thinking.

25:30.339 --> 25:32.573
If there's one thing
Laila knows, it's clocks, right?

25:32.608 --> 25:35.676
Yeah. And if we figured out
they've got the wrong one,

25:35.711 --> 25:37.112
you can bet she has.

25:37.146 --> 25:39.914
So what is she waiting for?

25:39.948 --> 25:41.315
For us to find her.

25:47.022 --> 25:49.856
(Thunderclap)

25:49.891 --> 25:51.725
(Grunts)

25:51.759 --> 25:53.593
You wouldn't be stalling now,
would you?

25:53.628 --> 25:55.429
There's almost a thousand pieces
in this clock.

25:55.463 --> 25:58.665
The clue be in any one of them.

25:58.699 --> 26:02.068
You like taking things apart.

26:02.102 --> 26:06.006
Not as much as I like
putting things back together.

26:15.582 --> 26:18.617
Is that what you did
to your husband?

26:18.652 --> 26:22.488
Put him back together again?

26:26.160 --> 26:28.061
What makes you think
I needed to?

26:34.534 --> 26:38.470
You took a 40-year-old man
who'd never been married...

26:38.504 --> 26:41.239
A man who doesn't believe in
something unless he can see it...

26:41.274 --> 26:42.407
and you made him believe in

26:42.442 --> 26:44.976
the one and only thing
no one can ever see.

26:45.010 --> 26:46.477
What's that?

26:46.511 --> 26:48.245
Love.

26:48.280 --> 26:51.014
And what makes you think
love can't be seen?

26:51.049 --> 26:52.950
What makes you think it can?

26:52.984 --> 26:54.452
Because I've seen it.

26:54.486 --> 26:55.953
Oh?

26:55.987 --> 27:00.023
In post-its filled with poems,
stuck on my bathroom mirror.

27:00.058 --> 27:01.357
And in a yellow tack

27:01.392 --> 27:03.226
given to me every single year
on my birthday,

27:03.260 --> 27:05.095
knowing that wherever
I stick it on the map,

27:05.129 --> 27:07.930
that's exactly where we're gonna
wake up the next morning.

27:07.965 --> 27:10.600
And you know what?

27:10.634 --> 27:12.902
I see it in Hank's eyes

27:12.936 --> 27:16.072
every single time
he looks at me.

27:16.107 --> 27:18.873
(Tool clatters)

27:21.811 --> 27:24.580
In his <i>eyes.</i>

27:24.614 --> 27:28.917
<i>Why</i> is that
so unbelievable to you?

27:32.622 --> 27:34.455
Oh.

27:34.490 --> 27:37.391
What's unbelievable is
it's taking you so long

27:37.426 --> 27:40.194
to fix the damn clock.

27:40.229 --> 27:41.662
Unless, of course,
you have a good reason.

27:41.696 --> 27:45.699
Perhaps, Laila,
you're waiting for something.

27:47.369 --> 27:49.436
(Knife clicks)

27:58.446 --> 28:00.713
(Computer beeping)

28:00.748 --> 28:03.150
(Rachel) Okay, here it comes.

28:09.189 --> 28:12.591
That's it? More math?

28:12.626 --> 28:14.426
This doesn't make sense.

28:14.461 --> 28:16.828
It feels like Einstein
made it impossible.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.230
Not just that he didn't want
the wrong person

28:18.265 --> 28:20.299
to find the clock.
He didn't want anyone to.

28:20.333 --> 28:22.933
(Hank) Or maybe his blackboard
is just a damn blackboard,

28:22.968 --> 28:25.870
and we're just wasting time.

28:25.904 --> 28:27.104
Wait.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.839
I think we missed something.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.507
It's a clue.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.210
This part here,
the part he erased,

28:33.244 --> 28:35.079
I think it's a cryptovariable.

28:35.113 --> 28:36.613
So what does that mean?

28:36.648 --> 28:38.149
It means that the part he erased
from his blackboard

28:38.183 --> 28:40.350
isn't a math problem.
It's a math solution.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.653
Like a decoder?

28:42.688 --> 28:44.020
Exactly.

28:44.055 --> 28:45.822
But a decoder for what?

28:45.856 --> 28:49.726
Well, maybe all of this.

28:54.098 --> 28:55.332
Give me a pen,

28:55.366 --> 28:57.367
something,
anything to write with.

29:23.959 --> 29:26.261
Hey. Can I borrow
your flashlight?

29:26.295 --> 29:27.462
Yeah.

29:46.648 --> 29:48.715
Hey.

29:48.749 --> 29:50.850
You all right?

29:50.884 --> 29:52.685
Yeah. Einstein's files.

29:59.460 --> 30:03.495
Did you know that in
the hospital, the last thing for

30:03.529 --> 30:05.897
was a piece of paper
and a pencil?

30:05.931 --> 30:07.299
(Chuckles)

30:07.333 --> 30:11.436
I cannot spend my whole life
searching for answers.

30:19.711 --> 30:21.445
(Mouths words)

30:29.120 --> 30:31.522
Mercer Oak. I've...

30:31.556 --> 30:33.857
I've read about that.

30:33.892 --> 30:36.793
Hey, guys,
we got a lead on the clock.

30:41.632 --> 30:43.266
Mercer Oak.

30:43.301 --> 30:46.436
It's a tree halfway between
Einstein's house and his office,

30:46.470 --> 30:48.805
<i>and he used to stop there</i>
<i>every day for lunch.</i>

30:50.408 --> 30:52.408
(Cell phone rings)

30:53.410 --> 30:54.876
Hank, where are you?

30:54.911 --> 30:56.011
28th street.

30:56.045 --> 30:57.513
I-I can't hear.
I'm going outside.

30:57.547 --> 31:00.882
I just... just... just wait
where you are. I'm coming.

31:00.917 --> 31:02.451
It's Laila.
She's leaving a trail.

31:05.655 --> 31:06.955
Hank!

31:29.143 --> 31:31.712
Laila?

31:31.746 --> 31:32.912
Hank!

31:55.069 --> 31:57.435
(Tacks rattle)

31:59.739 --> 32:01.974
I'm glad you got my message.

32:03.743 --> 32:05.878
<i>(Ticking)</i>

32:13.603 --> 32:14.736
Where is she?

32:14.770 --> 32:17.105
I thought you knew
exactly where she was,

32:17.140 --> 32:21.008
what with those little clues
she's been leaving you all day.

32:21.042 --> 32:24.211
At first I was angry,
but then I realized,

32:24.246 --> 32:26.280
that's the best way
to get what I wanted.

32:26.314 --> 32:27.515
And what is that?

32:27.549 --> 32:29.016
Isn't that obvious?

32:29.050 --> 32:33.354
Some time alone with you,
<i>brother.</i>

32:33.388 --> 32:35.388
(Grunts)

32:38.925 --> 32:41.561
My team found the next clock.

32:41.595 --> 32:44.897
I can tell you where it is
if... if you give her back to me.

32:44.931 --> 32:48.768
I'm afraid I'm not quite ready
to do that.

32:48.802 --> 32:50.603
I'd like
to get to know you better.

32:52.104 --> 32:55.440
Your wife filled in
some of the details.

32:55.475 --> 32:58.377
Mm, gushingly, in fact.

32:58.411 --> 33:01.046
(Chuckles)

33:01.080 --> 33:02.214
I-I don't understand.

33:02.248 --> 33:05.584
What do you... what do you want
to know?

33:05.618 --> 33:07.851
How the two of you met,
for starters.

33:07.886 --> 33:09.620
(Scoffs)

33:09.655 --> 33:11.522
How the two of us met?

33:11.557 --> 33:13.157
Uhh!

33:14.426 --> 33:17.027
How the two of you met,

33:17.062 --> 33:19.330
for starters.

33:19.364 --> 33:21.699
Cambridge,
four... four years ago,

33:21.733 --> 33:24.267
at the unveiling
of the Corpus Clock.

33:24.302 --> 33:26.603
<i>(Ticking)</i>

33:26.637 --> 33:30.674
If I remember correctly,
that is the clock

33:30.708 --> 33:32.342
with the locust on top.

33:34.579 --> 33:36.613
The locust that eats time,

33:36.647 --> 33:39.481
reminding us

33:39.516 --> 33:41.750
that time always has
the upper hand,

33:41.784 --> 33:44.052
always runs out...

33:45.388 --> 33:47.189
As it will for your wife.

33:49.158 --> 33:52.728
As it will for <i>you,</i> brother.

33:57.666 --> 34:00.668
(Doors creak)

34:02.737 --> 34:05.038
Stop calling me brother, okay?

34:05.072 --> 34:07.374
We have nothing in common.

34:07.408 --> 34:08.842
You know that's not true.

34:10.288 --> 34:13.561
<i>We both understand the shame
of the masquerade</i>

34:13.681 --> 34:16.149
But I've come
to offer you solace.

34:16.183 --> 34:18.417
Deliverance.

34:18.452 --> 34:20.286
What are you talking about?

34:21.821 --> 34:25.391
I-I-I want to see them.

34:27.494 --> 34:28.628
See what?

34:28.661 --> 34:31.063
The flaw, Hank!

34:31.097 --> 34:32.998
Show me the flaw!

34:33.032 --> 34:35.467
Ohh!

34:37.034 --> 34:39.504
(Gasps)

34:39.538 --> 34:42.741
Aah! Aah!

34:47.380 --> 34:48.880
(Gasps)

34:54.286 --> 34:56.786
Freeze!

34:56.821 --> 34:58.088
(Gunshot)

35:01.859 --> 35:03.026
Wait here.

35:11.201 --> 35:13.569
(Bullets ricochet)

35:16.373 --> 35:17.607
Uhh!

35:17.641 --> 35:19.509
(Gun clicks)

35:23.613 --> 35:26.448
(Both panting)

35:26.482 --> 35:28.817
Let me tell you why
you're not going to shoot me.

35:28.851 --> 35:31.687
(Clicking)

35:31.721 --> 35:32.987
Aah!

35:33.022 --> 35:34.889

35:34.924 --> 35:36.325
Uhh!

35:36.359 --> 35:37.725
Uhh!

35:37.759 --> 35:41.195
(Crying) We should be
formally acquainted.

35:41.229 --> 35:42.363
Do we know one other?

35:42.397 --> 35:44.732
March 7, 2008.

35:44.766 --> 35:47.468
You killed 270 people.

35:47.502 --> 35:50.471
March 7?

35:50.505 --> 35:52.740
Flight 71.

35:52.774 --> 35:55.375
Let me guess. Husband?

35:55.409 --> 35:57.276
He had a name.

35:57.311 --> 35:58.678
Theo Riley.

35:58.713 --> 36:00.880
But you wouldn't know that.

36:00.914 --> 36:02.982
You didn't know
any of their names.

36:03.016 --> 36:04.784
They were
just collateral damage

36:04.819 --> 36:08.020
in a plane crash that you caused
for God knows what reason!

36:08.055 --> 36:11.790
To you, he was nothing.

36:11.825 --> 36:14.693
To me, he was <i>everything.</i>

36:15.995 --> 36:19.365
Theo Riley.

36:19.399 --> 36:21.900
Seat 17a.

36:24.303 --> 36:27.438
Maybe he wasn't
just collateral damage.

36:27.473 --> 36:29.640
Maybe everyone else was.

36:40.386 --> 36:44.421
<i>(Ticking)</i>

37:18.127 --> 37:19.427
You found it.

37:19.461 --> 37:21.695
It's right where you said
it would be. Thank you.

37:21.730 --> 37:23.230
(Singsongy)
We should celebrate.

37:23.264 --> 37:24.564
The clock isn't the goal.

37:24.599 --> 37:26.066
It's a means to the end,
something to trade.

37:26.101 --> 37:28.002
We will celebrate
when Laila's home.

37:32.406 --> 37:33.641
(Sighs)

37:41.882 --> 37:43.716
Careful.

37:44.885 --> 37:46.385
Thanks.

37:58.631 --> 38:00.198
There's something down there.

38:00.232 --> 38:01.700
- What?
- At the bottom.

38:10.942 --> 38:12.242
Hank.

38:12.277 --> 38:15.780
Look at what we found inside
Einstein's clock.

38:15.814 --> 38:17.481
Beck talked about this.

38:17.515 --> 38:18.916
(Click)
She said that on his deathbed,

38:19.036 --> 38:21.466
The last thing he asked for was
a piece of paper and a pencil.

38:21.586 --> 38:24.288
We could be looking at
Einstein's final thoughts.

38:24.322 --> 38:25.622
Is Paige still here?

38:25.657 --> 38:27.291
- No, she left.
- Bring her back.

38:27.325 --> 38:28.725
We need to translate this.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.353
I have some information

39:33.387 --> 39:37.557
I think can help you
and... and your friend.

39:39.660 --> 39:43.029
This sect that you asked about,

39:43.064 --> 39:46.299
they call themselves
"The Shepherds."

39:48.569 --> 39:52.104
Their mission is to protect

39:52.139 --> 39:56.175
only the holiest of relics,

39:56.209 --> 39:59.646
those that are touched
by God himself.

39:59.680 --> 40:03.615
They're ready
to give their lives

40:03.650 --> 40:08.052
and... and take lives,
if need arises.

40:11.924 --> 40:15.126
Who are they protecting
the relics from?

40:17.563 --> 40:21.666
They're known only as
the Great Pirates.

40:27.005 --> 40:28.839
You had a visit with my friend?

40:31.009 --> 40:32.843
What did he tell you?

40:35.906 --> 40:37.547
(Paper smacks)

40:40.784 --> 40:42.251
(Types)

40:42.286 --> 40:43.419
What's it say?

40:43.453 --> 40:44.620
(Beep)

40:47.657 --> 40:50.993
(Hank) "I have always regretted
the role I played

40:51.028 --> 40:53.529
in the development
of the atomic bomb."

40:53.563 --> 40:57.365
<i>"But I have a chance</i>
<i>to atone for that now,</i>

40:57.399 --> 41:01.303
<i>to stop something</i>
<i>even more destructive."</i>

41:01.337 --> 41:03.104
<i>(Man on newsreel)</i>
<i>From Princeton, New Jersey,</i>

41:03.139 --> 41:05.440
<i>the emergency committee</i>
<i>of atomic scientists,</i>

41:05.474 --> 41:08.944
<i>headed by Dr. Einstein,</i>
<i>has issued an urgent appeal.</i>

41:08.978 --> 41:12.213
<i>"We scientists who released</i>
<i>this immense power</i>

41:12.247 --> 41:14.781
<i>have</i>
<i>overwhelming responsibility</i>

41:14.816 --> 41:18.986
<i>in this world</i>
<i>life-and-death struggle..."</i>

41:20.322 --> 41:22.489
Good.

41:22.523 --> 41:23.757
Good.

41:23.791 --> 41:24.825
<i>(Hank) "The line</i>
<i>has been crossed."</i>

41:24.860 --> 41:26.894
Now go do your chores.

41:26.928 --> 41:31.464
<i>"The line that once separated</i>
<i>man from his Creator.</i>

41:31.498 --> 41:35.335
We have found a way
to not only destroy man

41:35.369 --> 41:38.104
but God."

41:38.138 --> 41:42.575
