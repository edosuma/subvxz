(Dings)

00:02.426 --> 00:05.077
- Okay okay okay.
- Ah, not so fast.

00:05.078 --> 00:06.768
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry,

00:06.769 --> 00:09.262
but this elevator ride was the
first time we've actually been alone

00:09.263 --> 00:10.566
since we decided to get back together.

00:10.567 --> 00:12.248
Okay, all right. Last
kiss before we go inside.

00:12.249 --> 00:13.689
Wait wait wait. What?

00:13.690 --> 00:15.802
"Last kiss"? Why "last kiss"?

00:15.803 --> 00:18.754
We just had our first re-kiss. I went
all the way to Florida for that kiss.

00:19.973 --> 00:23.327
Well, I don't wanna tell
anyone that we're dating again.

00:23.328 --> 00:25.273
I ju... I just don't trust us yet.

00:25.274 --> 00:27.410
Trust? How could you not trust me?

00:27.411 --> 00:28.905
You've known me my whole life...

00:29.573 --> 00:31.184
Which explains why you don't trust me.

00:32.055 --> 00:34.598
Can't we just let us get used to being us

00:34.599 --> 00:36.422
before we bring anyone else into it?

00:36.423 --> 00:39.116
Fine, but if anyone asks,

00:39.117 --> 00:40.709
it'd be rude to lie.

00:43.912 --> 00:45.284
<i>(Door opens)</i>

00:45.285 --> 00:47.454
And we're back. Anyone wanna ask

00:47.455 --> 00:49.096
what happened at Riley's family reunion?

00:49.097 --> 00:51.080
- Anyone?
- Oh my God, why would they need to ask?

00:51.081 --> 00:53.364
'Cause I'm pretty sure that
they can guess what happened.

00:53.365 --> 00:56.262
You know, my family re-uned. (Laughs)

00:56.263 --> 00:59.143
Well, it was extra hot and steamy...

00:59.144 --> 01:01.209
the weather, the weather.
Not anything else.

01:02.534 --> 01:04.108
Oh, speaking of... Emma.

01:04.108 --> 01:06.188
Don't you wanna go say hi
to her right now? Please go.

01:06.189 --> 01:10.169
All right. Well, thank you for
a completely uneventful weekend.

01:17.394 --> 01:20.215
So... what'd I miss?

01:20.767 --> 01:22.780
I got a robot hand.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.332
Hey, baby.

01:26.333 --> 01:28.059
<i>- Daddy's home.
- (Door shuts)</i>

01:28.060 --> 01:31.590
Hey, guess what. So, Riley and
I are totally back together.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.696
And if you tell anyone, young lady,

01:33.697 --> 01:35.339
I'll be very impressed.

Everybody remember what you
are doing at this moment.

01:51.285 --> 01:53.957
We are at war with the Applewhites.

01:53.958 --> 01:55.335
Yes! (Laughs)

01:59.753 --> 02:01.335
What's an Applewhite?

02:02.516 --> 02:04.917
Are... are those the people
who bought your old house?

02:04.918 --> 02:07.494
- They're lovely.
- (Mockingly) They're lovely.

02:09.127 --> 02:11.666
No! They are trying to hijack

02:11.667 --> 02:13.365
my greatest achievement.

02:13.366 --> 02:15.238
Come on, that'll never happen.

02:15.239 --> 02:16.883
You'll always be my mom.

02:17.645 --> 02:19.428
No. No.

02:19.429 --> 02:23.055
They are bringing back
my block party Olympics.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.920
Yeah. That block was
nothing until I got there,

02:25.921 --> 02:28.221
and I'll be damned if they're
anything now that I'm gone.

02:29.655 --> 02:31.969
Mrs. Wheeler, just be
happy that you started

02:31.970 --> 02:34.189
a sweet neighborhood tradition.

02:34.190 --> 02:36.055
They're also cutting
down our old tree house.

02:36.056 --> 02:38.280
- Oh, those people have to pay!
- Yeah!

02:38.735 --> 02:41.417
We... we spent every day
up there when we were kids.

02:41.418 --> 02:43.709
Yeah. We probably should've
gone to school more often.

02:45.496 --> 02:46.896
Here's what's gonna happen:

02:46.897 --> 02:48.748
We're going to that block party,

02:48.749 --> 02:50.244
we're going to win,

02:50.245 --> 02:51.528
and the second we win,

02:51.529 --> 02:53.292
we are gonna shut it down for good,

02:53.293 --> 02:55.616
just like pregnancy did
to my modeling career.

02:57.126 --> 02:58.443
Well, I'm in.

02:58.444 --> 03:01.079
Yeah, I have always wanted
to go to a real block party.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.980
I mean, pie-eating contest, egg toss.

03:03.981 --> 03:06.813
I once did a three-legged race
with the guy who cut our hedges,

03:06.814 --> 03:09.218
but my dad had him
arrested right after that.

03:11.674 --> 03:14.580
Sorry, Tucker... For many things.

03:17.255 --> 03:19.556
But it's family only, okay?

03:19.557 --> 03:21.028
All right. Danny, grab your brother

03:21.029 --> 03:22.476
and pack up the station wagon.

03:22.477 --> 03:25.007
We have a neighborhood to destroy!

03:28.666 --> 03:32.095
- Hey.
- Sounds like quite the commotion out there.

03:32.096 --> 03:33.612
- Is everything all right?
- Of course it's all right.

03:33.613 --> 03:35.036
Why wouldn't it be all right?

03:38.629 --> 03:40.683
Oh my God, you're breaking up with me!

03:40.684 --> 03:41.672
No.

03:42.684 --> 03:44.003
It's just...

03:44.620 --> 03:47.895
The magazine has offered
me a position in Paris,

03:47.896 --> 03:51.115
and... I think I'm going to take it.

03:51.116 --> 03:52.718
You're moving to Paris?

03:52.719 --> 03:54.791
How is that not you breaking up with me?

03:55.265 --> 03:57.600
I'm sorry. I don't know what to do.

03:57.601 --> 03:59.041
I just keep thinking...

03:59.553 --> 04:01.855
"Could we ever really make this work?"

04:01.856 --> 04:04.396
I mean, we're so different.

04:04.397 --> 04:06.740
I know. You're a girl, I'm a boy.

04:06.741 --> 04:08.208
That's why it works so well.

04:10.391 --> 04:14.029
But you're so oddly close to your family.

04:15.305 --> 04:17.139
I just don't think I'll ever fit in.

04:17.140 --> 04:19.697
- That's not true.
- Hands off, people!

04:19.697 --> 04:22.814
No sex before the block party.
Danny, you're on hot dog duty.

04:22.815 --> 04:25.423
If you love me, you'll shove at least
40 of those down that gullet of yours.

04:25.424 --> 04:26.945
(British accent) 'Allo, Georgie.

04:34.706 --> 04:37.117
Hey, bro, there you are.
Let's catch up.

04:38.052 --> 04:39.774
But don't ask me about
my weekend with Riley,

04:39.775 --> 04:41.131
because I'm sworn to secrecy.

04:42.159 --> 04:44.319
How do I make Georgie feel
like she's part of our family?

04:44.735 --> 04:46.116
Hmm, that's a good question.

04:46.117 --> 04:48.378
Perhaps tell her something
no one else knows,

04:48.379 --> 04:51.284
something private about
someone else in your family.

04:51.285 --> 04:53.437
God, I wish I could help you out.

04:55.556 --> 04:57.031
I just hate for things to end.

04:57.032 --> 04:59.296
But it's hard to be a couple
when one of you lives in Paris.

04:59.297 --> 05:00.652
Well, if there's one
thing I don't know about,

05:00.653 --> 05:01.939
it's being a couple.

05:02.259 --> 05:04.637
Don't ask me or Riley about that, okay?

05:05.919 --> 05:08.360
Wait. Georgie's moving to Paris?

05:08.361 --> 05:10.091
Yeah, haven't you been listening?

05:10.092 --> 05:12.430
No, I've been trying to tell
you that Riley and I are dating.

05:12.431 --> 05:13.916
- (Scoffs)
- You are?

05:13.917 --> 05:15.999
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- I just did...

05:17.168 --> 05:20.037
Unless Riley asks, and then I didn't.

05:21.870 --> 05:24.622
- What do you think I should do?
- Well, don't mention it to her,

05:24.623 --> 05:27.320
but feel free to buy me a
drink and say congratulations.

05:28.124 --> 05:30.496
You know, sometimes I think
you're not even listening to me.

05:30.953 --> 05:32.644
No, thank you, man.

05:37.999 --> 05:40.494
Mom, I need you to help
me make Georgie feel

05:40.495 --> 05:42.750
- like she's part of the family.
- Fine.

05:42.751 --> 05:45.444
I'll borrow money from her
and then forget to pay it back.

05:48.326 --> 05:50.724
Ooh! Speaking of deadbeats,

05:50.725 --> 05:52.556
now that your dad isn't here

05:52.557 --> 05:55.455
to win the karaoke contest for
the block party, who should sing?

05:55.456 --> 05:58.421
Well, how about Georgie? She's
got a lot of hidden talents.

05:58.422 --> 06:00.543
(Chuckles) Yeah, they're not that hidden.

06:01.716 --> 06:05.378
<i>Tucker: ♪ I get so emotional, baby ♪</i>

06:05.707 --> 06:09.695

06:12.336 --> 06:13.987

06:29.651 --> 06:31.337
Like father, like son.

06:34.951 --> 06:38.388
What is so important that you
had to drag me out of the shower?

06:38.389 --> 06:41.126
I need you to sing as a Wheeler
at the block party karaoke-off!

06:41.127 --> 06:42.853
- I'm in!
- Great! Okay.

06:42.854 --> 06:45.697
Can you do what you were
doing in there out here?

06:45.698 --> 06:47.175
(Scoffs) Yeah.

06:52.904 --> 06:54.716
You meant the singing, right?

06:58.175 --> 07:01.859
My God. It's been forever
since I've been up here.

07:02.833 --> 07:04.923
I don't remember it being so roomy.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.608
Well, maybe because you
were a lot roomier back then.

07:09.274 --> 07:11.635
Thank you for coming
with me to say goodbye.

07:12.071 --> 07:13.951
God, I love this tree house.

07:13.952 --> 07:15.873
I can't believe they're tearing it down.

07:16.612 --> 07:18.174
Aren't you upset?

07:18.175 --> 07:20.286
I've actually got a
three-bedroom in the city now,

07:20.287 --> 07:21.864
so I'm good.

07:22.677 --> 07:24.742
Well, this fort was everything to me.

07:25.128 --> 07:28.227
I mean, when I was up here,
everything was perfect.

07:28.228 --> 07:31.126
I didn't hate my mom. I wasn't fat.

07:31.127 --> 07:32.632
I had friends.

07:32.633 --> 07:34.463
You had Danny. (Chuckles)

07:34.464 --> 07:36.225
Well, he was enough.

07:37.115 --> 07:40.000
I just... I felt really safe.

07:44.603 --> 07:46.829
Now if only you could
feel that way with me.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.839
Are you sure I can't tell
people we're a couple?

07:49.840 --> 07:51.553
- (Shouts) Hey, orchard Lane!
- Oh my God, Ben.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.101
What are you doing?

07:53.102 --> 07:55.725
- I'm not ready, okay? We're not ready.
- (Scoffs)

07:55.726 --> 07:58.458
Yes, we are. We are like this tree house...

07:58.459 --> 08:01.893
solid, dependable and we'll
withstand the test of time.

08:02.467 --> 08:05.653
We're here because they're
ripping it out by it's roots.

08:06.502 --> 08:08.239
Shut up and kiss me.

08:10.068 --> 08:11.647
Wait, what is that?

08:16.957 --> 08:19.142
"D.W. + R.P."?

08:19.898 --> 08:22.208
"Danny Wheeler loves Riley Perrin"?

08:22.209 --> 08:23.721
Have you ever seen this?

08:29.293 --> 08:31.843
Really?
"D.W. + R.P."?

08:31.844 --> 08:33.672
I can't believe you used
to be in love with her.

08:33.673 --> 08:36.041
Love? Who said anything about love?

08:36.042 --> 08:38.568
- I know I didn't.
- I mean, I'm sure if it was anything,

08:38.570 --> 08:40.256
it was nothing more than a crush.

08:40.256 --> 08:42.203
Yeah, it isn't anything. I didn't do it.

08:42.203 --> 08:43.833
If I did, I think I'd remember.

08:43.835 --> 08:46.773
I wonder what these
letters "T. L.A." Stand for.

08:46.774 --> 08:50.718
- "True love always."
- Aha! You did do it!

08:51.654 --> 08:54.856
Wait. So that means you really did
used to have feelings for Riley?

08:54.857 --> 08:56.127
What? No!

08:56.486 --> 08:58.701
Who can even remember? We were kids.

08:58.702 --> 09:00.742
Let's move on! Let's
talk about something else.

09:00.743 --> 09:03.724
Something more exciting like how
Ben and Riley are back together!

09:03.725 --> 09:05.006
(Snaps fingers, mouths)

09:06.655 --> 09:09.465
- Excuse me?
- That's right. Congratulations.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.376
(Scoffs) I'm sorry. How did you know
that Ben and I were back together?

09:12.377 --> 09:14.265
- Danny told me.
- Ben told me.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.560
Is there, uh, something
that you wanna tell me?

09:18.561 --> 09:21.647
- (Sighs)
- God, Ben! I thought we agreed.

09:21.648 --> 09:24.236
Riley, I'm just excited.
Why aren't you excited?

09:24.237 --> 09:26.242
Well, because what if you change your mind?

09:26.243 --> 09:28.685
- I'm not going to!
- Well, what if I don't believe you?

09:29.039 --> 09:30.726
I mean, what if you break my heart again?

09:30.727 --> 09:33.327
Because history shows
you're pretty good at that.

09:33.328 --> 09:34.976
So that's what this is about... the past.

09:34.977 --> 09:36.422
Are you ever gonna let it go?

09:36.423 --> 09:39.482
(Scoffs) It's a lot to let go, Ben.

09:39.483 --> 09:42.289
Is it? Look, I get that
I was an immature jerk,

09:42.290 --> 09:45.288
but I've been genuinely trying to
change and it's still not enough for you.

09:45.701 --> 09:47.782
- (Sighs)
- It's never gonna be enough for you.

09:47.783 --> 09:49.914
You know what? Don't worry
about having to tell anyone.

09:49.915 --> 09:51.754
Because from where I'm standing, Riley,

09:51.755 --> 09:53.555
there's nothing to tell.

09:53.556 --> 09:55.217
<i>- (Door opens)
- Ben.</i>

09:55.218 --> 09:57.261
- Whatever.
- (Door closes)

09:59.625 --> 10:02.436
I know we should've left, but
it was getting really good.

10:12.710 --> 10:17.295
So I was under the impression
that you only had two sons.

10:17.296 --> 10:21.253
Yeah. Yeah, we adopted
this little guy, huh?

10:21.254 --> 10:23.699
Ben and Danny just had to have him.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.174
- (Both laugh)
- Hi, I'm Tucker Wheeler,

10:26.175 --> 10:27.991
the only Wheeler with a future.

10:28.417 --> 10:30.676
Well, I don't care how many sons you have.

10:31.067 --> 10:35.524
Looks like your days of
ruling this block are over!

10:35.525 --> 10:36.587
- (Gasps)
- (Laughs)

10:37.835 --> 10:39.394
So much for your future.

10:39.395 --> 10:41.838
(Mockingly laughs) Okay.

10:42.299 --> 10:45.245
- Second place?
- Well, you can't blame Emma.

10:45.246 --> 10:47.957
She took first in the
baby wrestling contest.

10:47.958 --> 10:51.189
Well, I'm not blaming her.
I'm blaming you two. (Emma fusses)

10:51.190 --> 10:54.248
How could you come in
last in the wheelbarrow race?

10:54.249 --> 10:57.441
- Oh my God, you're do heavy.
- Come on, just lift me up!

10:57.442 --> 11:00.875
I'm trying! Why are they so fast?

11:00.876 --> 11:02.366
Oh my God!

11:03.396 --> 11:06.913
Yeah, we probably didn't think
that one all the way through.

11:06.914 --> 11:08.486
Okay, we really only have two chances left

11:08.487 --> 11:10.904
to take this thing...
karaoke and pie eating.

11:10.905 --> 11:13.312
You, go warm up your vocal
cords. You, go find Ben.

11:13.313 --> 11:15.196
Oh, no need, Georgie's got it.

11:15.197 --> 11:17.572
- She loves pie.
- She weighs less than a pie!

11:18.386 --> 11:21.860
- Hey, Tuck. Tucker.
- (Mouths)

11:21.861 --> 11:23.133
Hey, have you seen Riley?

11:23.134 --> 11:25.558
I think I may have overreacted to
the whole me-and-her-dating thing

11:25.559 --> 11:27.726
oh, by the way, me and
Riley are dating again.

11:27.727 --> 11:32.042
Wow. You really can talk
anybody into anything, can't you?

11:32.043 --> 11:33.426
- (Laughs)
- For your information,

11:33.427 --> 11:34.841
I'm about to do something so romantic,

11:34.842 --> 11:36.470
she's gonna wanna marry me...

11:36.471 --> 11:38.240
In three or four years.
Let's not get crazy.

11:39.539 --> 11:42.450
<i>- (Shouting, cheering)
- Go! Go!</i>

11:44.006 --> 11:46.641
Stop chewing! It's slowing you down!

11:46.642 --> 11:49.810
Come on, baby! You are so hot right now.

11:50.546 --> 11:51.853
<i>- Yes!
- Danny:  Yes!</i>

11:51.854 --> 11:54.028
In your pie holes, suckers!

11:57.406 --> 11:59.067
That was amazing. What's next?

11:59.068 --> 12:01.331
Apple bobbing? Cage
fighting? Pig wrestling?

12:01.332 --> 12:02.808
I'm ready for anything.

12:06.192 --> 12:09.415
My niece. We're a very close family.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.298
Hey. Hey, Tucker, have you seen Ben?

12:13.299 --> 12:14.820
And why are you stretching?

12:15.327 --> 12:18.311
Oh, silly, off-key,
out-of-tune Riley.

12:18.796 --> 12:21.440
If I don't stretch it here, it
don't come out here. (Chuckles)

12:21.966 --> 12:24.067
Okay, I just... I really
need to talk to him,

12:24.068 --> 12:25.697
'cause I think I kind of overreacted,

12:25.698 --> 12:27.974
but... but who could blame
me for not trusting him?

12:27.975 --> 12:31.482
Riley, he's not the kind of
guy to run away from things.

12:31.832 --> 12:34.456
I think Emma's proof of that.

12:38.299 --> 12:42.466
Oh my God. How could I think
that I wouldn't be safe with him?

12:42.467 --> 12:45.081
This man is willing to
scream how he feels about me

12:45.082 --> 12:47.486
from the treetops. What is wrong with me?

12:47.487 --> 12:49.695
- So much. Let me...
- Rhetorical!

12:49.696 --> 12:52.626
Oh my God. I just... I'm gonna
climb to the top of the tree house

12:52.627 --> 12:54.273
and I'm gonna yell out to the world

12:54.274 --> 12:56.677
that I am dating Ben Wheeler.

12:56.678 --> 12:59.818
- Oh, by the way, Ben and I are...
- Yeah, I got that.

13:01.664 --> 13:04.689
Yeah, she's walking and talking
now. It's... it's really special.

13:05.757 --> 13:07.844
Emma? Emma!

13:07.845 --> 13:09.186
Has anyone seen Emma?

13:09.187 --> 13:11.163
Oh, there you are. (Chuckles)

13:14.915 --> 13:16.356
Oh my God.

13:18.421 --> 13:19.894
I'm too late.

13:30.874 --> 13:34.221
You might as well hand over
that trophy right now, Joanie.

13:34.222 --> 13:37.481
My five-alarm chili hasn't
met a judge it couldn't seduce.

13:37.482 --> 13:40.121
And quite frankly, neither have I.

13:40.122 --> 13:42.546
Well, we'll see what my
husband Bob has to say.

13:42.547 --> 13:45.387
Oh, didn't you know that
Bob was one of the judges?

13:45.388 --> 13:48.153
- (Gasps)
- Oh, I knew.

13:48.154 --> 13:50.692
Hope that doesn't ruin your
chances for karaoke, Bobby.

13:50.693 --> 13:52.896
I hear you have a beautiful voice.

13:52.897 --> 13:54.414
(Raspily) I can't talk!

13:54.415 --> 13:56.606
Well, it turns out I can't cook. Oops!

13:57.338 --> 13:58.593
Oh, Mrs. Wheeler, you won't believe it.

13:58.594 --> 14:00.733
They cut down our tree house.

14:00.734 --> 14:03.628
I told you those applesauces were rotten.

14:03.629 --> 14:05.651
Yeah, well, I'd burn the whole
neighborhood to the ground

14:05.652 --> 14:07.498
if I thought it would get rid of you.

14:07.499 --> 14:10.072
Oh, you're never getting rid of me.

14:10.073 --> 14:12.865
I've given birth to two
kids and a block party,

14:12.866 --> 14:15.027
and guess which one I'm most proud of.

14:16.266 --> 14:17.666
Okay. I was just wondering

14:17.667 --> 14:19.683
can I use the stage to
make a quick announcement?

14:19.684 --> 14:20.956
Ooh! No can do.

14:20.957 --> 14:23.250
The stage is reserved
for karaoke-palooza...

14:23.251 --> 14:26.534
the final nail in the Applewhite coffin.

14:26.535 --> 14:28.143
If you sing for team Applewhite,

14:28.144 --> 14:32.409
- you can say whatever you want.
- Oh, no can do, Joan Joan.

14:32.410 --> 14:35.035
Remember, only family members can compete.

14:35.036 --> 14:37.042
Well, as block party president,

14:37.043 --> 14:39.352
I say it's time to change that rule.

14:39.353 --> 14:41.632
- Oh, you wouldn't dare.
- Oh, I dare.

14:41.633 --> 14:45.513
- Looks like I'm singing.
- Fine, if that's the way you wanna win...

14:45.514 --> 14:47.524
- by cheating.
- (Scoffs)

14:47.525 --> 14:49.479
- Am I right, son?
- You got it, mom.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.224
- Mommy loves you.
- I love you too, mommy.

14:51.225 --> 14:52.582
See?

14:55.828 --> 14:58.077
(Clears throat) Uh, hello.

14:58.078 --> 15:00.345
Orchard Lane friends and family,

15:00.346 --> 15:03.738
well, just friends 'cause
my family's in Florida.

15:04.092 --> 15:05.537
Please don't rob us.

15:05.935 --> 15:09.163
Anyway, well, I grew up over there,

15:09.164 --> 15:11.715
but what many of you probably don't know

15:11.716 --> 15:13.404
is I spent my life

15:13.405 --> 15:16.320
in love with the boy who lived over there,

15:16.899 --> 15:18.333
Ben Wheeler.

15:18.836 --> 15:21.548
And not much has changed,

15:21.549 --> 15:23.615
so I want the world to know

15:23.616 --> 15:25.611
exactly how I feel about him.

17:02.257 --> 17:03.760
I loved it.

17:04.544 --> 17:06.098
Are they all like that?

17:06.098 --> 17:07.884
Yeah, pretty much...

my mom gets in a fight and
somebody pulls out a hose.

17:11.633 --> 17:14.419
Now I think it's my turn to ask.

17:14.420 --> 17:16.310
Is everything all right with you?

17:16.709 --> 17:18.846
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:18.847 --> 17:20.788
I guess I'm just thinking about stuff.

Us.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.737
All good things, I hope.

17:25.483 --> 17:27.958
I think I'm going to say no to Paris.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.181
No, you can't do that.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.704
Danny, I want to see if
we can make this work.

17:32.067 --> 17:33.781
So do I.

17:36.195 --> 17:37.905
What if I came with you?

17:38.370 --> 17:40.512
(Chuckles) Come with me to Paris?

17:41.217 --> 17:42.840
I'm supposed to leave next week.

17:42.841 --> 17:45.564
I'm in. The season just
ended. It's perfect.

17:47.487 --> 17:50.579
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

17:51.047 --> 17:53.151
It's time I tried something new.

17:59.197 --> 18:01.230
Okay, no peeking.

18:01.231 --> 18:03.392
Fine, but when I open my eyes,

18:03.393 --> 18:05.172
you better have pants on.

18:06.224 --> 18:09.252
(Chuckles) All right. And open your eyes.

18:10.635 --> 18:12.135
Oh my God.

18:13.375 --> 18:14.915
Are you serious?

18:14.916 --> 18:16.937
Well, you said you felt safe there.

18:16.938 --> 18:19.494
This is my way of saying
you'll always be safe with me.

18:24.263 --> 18:26.761
(Chuckles) How did you
even get this up here?

18:26.762 --> 18:28.605
Blood, sweat and a lot of Danny.

18:29.846 --> 18:32.040
And now may I offer you a glass of...

18:32.041 --> 18:33.843
(snaps) I managed to
remember the tree house,

18:33.844 --> 18:36.129
but actually forgot the
wine. I'll be right back.

18:49.209 --> 18:51.024
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:52.009 --> 18:55.134
This... this is amazing.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.922
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

18:57.642 --> 19:00.476
(Sighs) So is everything
okay with you and Ben now?

19:00.477 --> 19:04.788
Yeah. Yeah, I think it actually is.

19:04.789 --> 19:08.872
Good, because I need to know
someone's taking care of you when I leave.

19:10.013 --> 19:11.446
Leave?

19:12.381 --> 19:15.341
- Where are you going?
- Georgie's moving to Paris

19:15.342 --> 19:17.208
and I've decided to go with her.

19:17.209 --> 19:18.645
(Laughs) Paris?

19:19.207 --> 19:20.940
For how long?

19:20.941 --> 19:23.683
I don't know. I guess I'm just
gonna kinda see what happens.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.996
- But what about me?
- You?

19:30.551 --> 19:32.165
You've got Ben now.

19:32.888 --> 19:34.488
He's your future.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.178
I need to see if Georgie's mine.

19:40.238 --> 19:41.754

Did you break this?

19:48.333 --> 19:50.091
Probably just happened in the move.

20:05.233 --> 20:08.213

having you in my life.

20:10.221 --> 20:13.869
It's gonna be okay. You'll be fine.

20:26.980 --> 20:28.941
Goodbye, Riley.

20:35.253 --> 20:36.888
She's all yours.

20:42.018 --> 20:43.608
(Mutters) Is she?

20:49.832 --> 20:51.693
Here's a life lesson for you, Emma.

20:51.694 --> 20:53.585
Fight for what you believe in,

20:53.586 --> 20:55.405
and who says you can't go home again?

20:55.406 --> 20:57.368
Well, the Applewhites and the police.

20:57.369 --> 21:00.847
Ah. Yeah, I actually won this platter
fair-ish and square-ish.

21:00.848 --> 21:04.271
I believe it's called broke-ish
and entered-ish.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.417
You know, I don't say this lightly, Tucker,

21:06.418 --> 21:08.901
but I did enjoy having
you as a son for the day.

21:08.902 --> 21:12.777
Thank you. And it was great
being an honorary Wheeler for the day.

21:12.778 --> 21:15.785
(Chuckles) Made me appreciate
my own family a lot more.

21:16.330 --> 21:19.156
