it was made, that is its true value.

was commissioned to make the clock...

no matter what the cost.

21:01.135 --> 21:03.171
My father's obsession...

21:04.013 --> 21:07.176
...made me an orphan
long before he died.

But according to the number one website

I was Swann's disciple.
He taught me everything.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.814
Then he must have taught you
that I was good.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.149
That I'm not a threat.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.235
He wouldn't want you to kill me.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.865
Swann was an idealist.

24:14.036 --> 24:17.153
He said you would rule us with strength.

24:17.456 --> 24:21.540
But for every passage Swann quoted
of the Traveler coming to save Earth...

24:21.710 --> 24:25.373
...there was another interpretation
that cast you...

24:25.548 --> 24:26.628

in high school.

Well, in the beginning, Naman and Sageeth
each have their own distinct symbol.

look like a combination of the two?

35:50.982 --> 35:52.643

So I called a professor at Met U

Facing west?
