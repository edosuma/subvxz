00:06.674 --> 00:08.476
In the criminal
justice system,

00:08.509 --> 00:10.144
sexually-based offenses

00:10.178 --> 00:12.080
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.113 --> 00:15.083
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:15.116 --> 00:16.517
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.550 --> 00:18.252
are members of an elite squad

00:18.286 --> 00:20.121
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.390
These are their stories.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.696
I think I'm having
a heart attack!

00:28.729 --> 00:30.198
It's just a cramp.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.266
Run through it, Bernie.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.567
You gotta let me rest.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.836
Uh-uh, rest
is a four-letter word.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.305
Let's think positive.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.606
[baby crying]
No, stop!

00:38.639 --> 00:40.208
Bernie...

00:40.241 --> 00:42.176
There's a baby in here.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.544
[crying]

00:43.577 --> 00:45.346
With a note taped to it.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.781
Oh...

00:47.815 --> 00:50.818
Hey.

00:50.851 --> 00:54.288
Someone abandoned him?

00:54.322 --> 00:56.324
Not according to this.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.292
The mom was abducted?

00:58.326 --> 01:00.261
Yeah, no ID
in the jogger's stroller.

01:00.294 --> 01:03.764
Drag marks end here.

01:03.797 --> 01:07.201
Well, the perp or perps
must have had a car waiting,

01:07.235 --> 01:09.537
forces her inside,
peels out.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.772
Find any footprints?

01:11.805 --> 01:13.441
Over here
in a patch of dirt.

01:13.474 --> 01:16.210
It's small.
I figure it's hers.

01:16.244 --> 01:19.513
Which leads into here.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.182
This is a perfect place
for a rape.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.250
It's isolated.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.517
There's no view
from any direction.

01:23.551 --> 01:26.354
Yeah, but why abduct her
if he's already raped her?

01:26.387 --> 01:27.621
These are not
just ripped.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.757
They're shredded.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.460
Ultra-sharp blade, thin.
Maybe a box cutter.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.328
Hard to say no to.

01:34.362 --> 01:37.331
Especially if he's
threatening the baby.

01:37.365 --> 01:38.432
Is he okay?

01:38.466 --> 01:40.768
A little hungry,
but no sign of trauma.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.304
I'm taking him to the ER
for a full exam.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.705
Note was stuck
to the kid with duct tape.

01:44.738 --> 01:47.241
Which he could have used
to bind and gag mom.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.276
This guy came prepared.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.377
Yeah, I'll say.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.212
The note was pre-printed
from a computer.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.880
Will you show him?

01:52.913 --> 01:54.682
He signed it
Rupert Daniel Kilmore.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.350
I'm not sure
if that's his real name

01:56.384 --> 01:57.518
or the author
of this poem.

01:57.551 --> 01:58.852
Poem.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.522
"The mean, mean man
has a monster in his head.

02:01.555 --> 02:05.759
Find him by tomorrow
or my mommy will be dead."

02:56.777 --> 02:58.712
This guy have a vendetta
against all mothers

02:58.746 --> 02:59.947
or this one in particular?

02:59.980 --> 03:00.948
Who knows?

03:00.981 --> 03:02.916
We don't even have
a bead on our victim yet.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.552
Well, he's given us
a day to figure it out.

03:04.585 --> 03:05.553
Does that mean
same time tomorrow,

03:05.586 --> 03:06.854
or midnight tonight?

03:06.887 --> 03:07.988
Let's assume
worst-case scenario.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.523
That gives us 13 hours.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.392
Figure the prints on
the baby's stroller are mom's.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.493
No hits in the system.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.961
Nothing
from missing persons.

03:13.994 --> 03:14.962
And if there is a husband,

03:14.995 --> 03:17.298
he might not know till
he gets back from work.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.999
All right, that leaves us
with the stroller and the baby.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.768
We're checking
the gift registries.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.303
This jogger's stroller
is a huge seller.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.437
Well, the baby's
one of a kind.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.373
Let's get his picture
out on the news.

03:25.406 --> 03:28.008
Just say a baby was found.
Withhold all details.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.176
Not many to give.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.979
Only prints on the note are
from the jogger who found it.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.213
Well, what about
the name?

03:33.247 --> 03:35.583
There's no listing in Manhattan
for a Rupert Kilmore.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.285
The closest one
is Staten island.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.353
Get going.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.257
You got a sec?

03:43.291 --> 03:45.359
Uh, 60 every minute.

03:45.393 --> 03:48.496
Unfortunately,
this little guy only has 52.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.298
Hairspring's gummed up.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.632
You're really
into time, Rupert.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.501
Fourth generation
horologist.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.035
What are you
in the market for?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.604
Missing woman.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.939
Who?
We're hoping
that you can tell us.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.575
Seeing as your name
is written on a note

04:01.609 --> 04:03.277
threatening to kill her.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.978
You've got the wrong
Rupert Kilmore.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.614
You're the only one
in this time zone.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.948
So tell us, Rupert,
why would a rapist

04:07.981 --> 04:09.317
use your full name?

04:09.350 --> 04:12.620
Rapist?!
I have no idea.

04:12.653 --> 04:16.324
[telephone rings]

04:16.357 --> 04:19.360
Kilmore Time.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.894
Yes, they're
standing right here.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.063
Hello?
Hello?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.898
Who is that?
He didn't say.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.334
Just asked if the cops
were here,

04:26.367 --> 04:27.568
and to give them
the facts.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.069
I swear,
I don't know anything.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.838
Not facts, fax.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.542
Son of a bitch
is watching us.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.843
It's another poem.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.678
"Once there were
some cops so dumb.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.647
"Took them hours
to get to clue number one.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.349
"Mommy's
running out of time,

04:41.382 --> 04:43.551
so the answer is written
above the rhyme."

04:43.584 --> 04:45.386
The header.
"Jiffy's Copy Center."

04:45.419 --> 04:46.587
That's right
down the street.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.489
There it is.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.025
Police!

04:52.059 --> 04:54.362
We'd appreciate
your cooperation.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.829
Nobody leaves
until we say so.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.865
This was faxed from here
a few minutes ago.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.032
Who sent it?

04:59.066 --> 05:00.067
Uh, was there
a cover sheet?

05:00.100 --> 05:01.635
No.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.103
Black guy, thin.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.338
Really antsy.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.439
Where did he go?

05:05.473 --> 05:06.674
He just paid and left.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.342
He didn't even wait
for me to send it.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.777
Could be
on any paper in here.

05:09.810 --> 05:10.978
What was he wearing?

05:11.011 --> 05:12.713
A ratty,
long overcoat.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.014
He looked like
a homeless guy.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.016
Okay, a homeless guy
just left here.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.685
Has anyone seen him?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.420
Could have the man
I passed coming in.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.455
He was heading
toward the alley.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.894
What is this,
another game?

05:26.927 --> 05:28.328
Yeah, hide and seek.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.568
Gotcha, dirt bag!
Up! Up!

05:34.602 --> 05:36.837
Hands up!
Hands up!

05:36.870 --> 05:39.006
But they're so heavy.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.474
Shut up.
Where is she?

05:40.508 --> 05:41.609
Who?

05:41.642 --> 05:43.010
The woman!
Where is she?

05:43.043 --> 05:45.413
Uh, oh, oh,
you must be the cops

05:45.446 --> 05:46.614
I was supposed
to wait for.

05:46.647 --> 05:47.615
What are you
talking about?

05:47.648 --> 05:49.583
The man I sent
the fax for.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.719
Right, who was that?
Who? Who?

05:51.752 --> 05:53.153
Who?
Uh--

05:53.186 --> 05:54.388
The man!
Who is it?

05:54.422 --> 05:57.024
He stuck a knife
in my back.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.827
He gave me the fax
and 20 bucks.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.829
Hey! Hey!

06:01.862 --> 06:03.631
Why were you supposed
to wait here for us?

06:03.664 --> 06:05.499
Give you the message.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.701
Message?
Where's the message.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.470
In here.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.471
Oh, that's just great.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.705
What is it?

06:11.739 --> 06:13.474
What's what?
The clue!

06:13.507 --> 06:14.608
He needs sugar.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.544
Okay, I want you
to think now, okay?

06:16.577 --> 06:17.845
He told you
to memorize it, right?

06:17.878 --> 06:18.979
Right!
Right.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.681
Was it a poem?
No, no, it didn't rhyme.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.416
Okay, was it a riddle?

06:22.450 --> 06:25.519
Uh, no, just,
just words.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.855
Yo!
Half a bar of chocolate.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.190
Eat.
Open your mouth.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.159
Eat.
Eat.

06:32.192 --> 06:36.096
Hog, pat, mend, top, yarn.
It makes no sense.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.665
Well, we've been
grilling him for eight hours,

06:37.698 --> 06:39.032
and he swears
that that's it.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.100
Yo, Hophead!

06:40.133 --> 06:41.535
No sleep until
you get it right.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.738
Hog, pat,
mend, top, yarn!

06:44.772 --> 06:46.807
Mend, yarn--maybe the clue
has something to do

06:46.840 --> 06:48.542
with a tailor
or a seamstress.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.376
You mend with yarn?

06:49.409 --> 06:51.512
No, with thread.
You knit with yarn.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.714
Look, so far,
every clue has paid off.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.483
(Stabler)
Yo, come on, think!
What'd you leave out?

06:55.516 --> 06:57.851
Okay, mend and yarn
have a clothes theme.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.186
Maybe top is a blouse.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.821
(Cragen)
How do hog and pat fit in?

07:00.854 --> 07:03.223
Some kind of petting zoo!

07:03.256 --> 07:05.459
Shut up!
Someone outside
to see you.

07:05.493 --> 07:08.662
Delivery for you, Captain.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.564
Detective Stabler.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.232
Eric Liebert.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.967
They told me
you had some information

07:14.001 --> 07:15.235
about my wife and baby.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.472
Yeah.
Do you have a picture?

07:18.506 --> 07:20.107
I got a call.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.109
Somebody saw Timmy's picture
on the news.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.644
Yeah, okay,
your son is fine.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.112
He's with
protective services.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.548
What about Julie?

07:27.581 --> 07:30.050
We're looking for her.
Do you have a picture of her?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.852
That'd really
help us out.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.625
What happened to her?

07:37.658 --> 07:39.560
She's been abducted.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.360
What?

07:40.393 --> 07:42.262
Let's talk
in the squad room, okay?

07:42.295 --> 07:45.566
Do you know anyone
who would want to harm her?

07:45.599 --> 07:47.267
No, of course not.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.602
Call CSU over here now.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.138
Just give me one second.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.573
Who is that?

07:52.606 --> 07:54.508
It's her husband,
Eric Liebert.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.076
Sir, would you
come with me, please?

07:56.109 --> 07:57.978
No.
What is that?

07:58.011 --> 08:00.581
What are you hiding?
That's my wife's earring.

08:00.614 --> 08:01.582
I gave it to her.

08:01.615 --> 08:02.282
Oh, my God!

08:02.315 --> 08:04.117
Is that her ear?!

08:04.151 --> 08:05.786
Ohh...mmm...

08:05.819 --> 08:07.220
Please.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.022
What did he do to her?

08:09.056 --> 08:11.825
She didn't hurt anybody.
You gotta find her!

08:11.859 --> 08:13.093
(Cragen)
Take him to my office.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.195
How in the hell
did RDK get this in here?

08:15.228 --> 08:16.997
It was dropped off
at the front desk,

08:17.030 --> 08:18.231
addressed to the captain.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.299
Look at
the return address.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.936
Hog, pat, mend,
top, yarn.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.105
Son of a bitch.
The crack head got it right.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.173
Yes, he did.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.775
But RDK
ran out of patience.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.276
A new poem
came with the ear.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.645
"Julie was so sad
to hear you were late.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.247
Keep us waiting again,
she'll meet a much worse fate."

08:34.281 --> 08:35.783
It still doesn't
tell us where to go.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.586
The clue has got to be
in the return address.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.154
Crack head repeated
the same damn words.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.189
It's an anagram.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.591
I'm rearranging letters

08:43.624 --> 08:45.893
and coming up
with two street names.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.662
Mott and Grand.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.963
Okay.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.833
But we still have, what?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.267
Eight letters left.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.304
We got "P," "A,"
P-A-Y.

08:57.337 --> 09:01.041
The last letters
spell phone.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.876
Pay phone
at Mott and Grand.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.579
There it is.

09:05.613 --> 09:06.814
Plenty of windows
looking down on us, huh?

09:06.847 --> 09:09.583
Way too many to check.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.318
Dial tone.
It's working.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.288
All right,
we're here, already!

09:15.322 --> 09:16.590
Let's drop a dime!

09:16.624 --> 09:18.592
Nothing...

09:18.626 --> 09:21.561
got some petrified gum.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.098
Hey, hold on.
I got something.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.003
Nothing on the outside.

09:30.037 --> 09:34.374
"You're running out of time.
MMCXXXII."

09:34.407 --> 09:35.342
Roman numerals.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.344
2,132.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.647
So what is that,
a date, time, address?

09:39.680 --> 09:40.814
Time, the clue's
gotta be time.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.817
"You're running out of time.
How about--"

09:43.851 --> 09:45.318
Military time.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.320
21:32 hours.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.690
Make it 9:32.

09:49.723 --> 09:52.726
That's over an hour ago.
Maybe we missed the call.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.663
He made the call from somewhere.
Have Terry trace it.

10:00.701 --> 10:01.802
Yeah, this
is Detective Benson.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.037
I need a rush dump on the number
that I'm calling from.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.707
Incoming, 9:32 p.m.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.142
If midnight is our deadline,
we got 90 minutes.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.811
Police!

10:13.981 --> 10:15.749
"Congratulations."

10:22.455 --> 10:24.391
Guys, over here.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.328
There's a note.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.263
"Sorry, you are too late.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.901
"Consolation prize inside.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.068
Unwrap and enjoy."

10:35.102 --> 10:38.271
It's not her fault.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.307
We were late.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.876
45 minutes late.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.780
(Munch) He wrote
his initials on her.

10:46.814 --> 10:47.915
"RDK:
Rupert Daniel Kilmore."

10:47.948 --> 10:49.249
We're back to this
again now?

10:49.282 --> 10:51.685
We've had someone
on the clockmaker all day.

10:51.719 --> 10:52.686
He hasn't budged.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.387
(Munch)
"RDK is..."

10:54.421 --> 10:57.024
Maybe the arrow
points to the answer.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.129
No, there's nothing
on her back.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.797
Back.
That's the riddle.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.065
"RDK is back."

11:05.098 --> 11:06.834
Well, then,
who the hell is RDK?

11:06.867 --> 11:08.335
Is Julie missing
any fingers?

11:08.368 --> 11:09.402
No, why?

11:09.436 --> 11:11.772
I just found three
on the pillow in the bedroom,

11:11.805 --> 11:13.807
and this card.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.843
"Fun, fun, fun,
let's play again.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.144
"For the next feather
in my cap,

11:17.177 --> 11:19.780
"Check in the policeman's
helmet."

11:27.287 --> 11:29.890
(Cragen)
RDK was a serial killer
who terrorized Manhattan

11:29.923 --> 11:33.026
in the late '70s
early '80s.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.361
I had just made detective.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.064
All but one
of his six victims

11:37.097 --> 11:39.332
were raped,
dismembered, and killed,

11:39.366 --> 11:41.201
earning him
the moniker RDK.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.203
What happened
to number six?

11:43.236 --> 11:44.304
Jeanette Henley.

11:44.337 --> 11:47.908
She fought back
and managed to escape.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.109
She get a look at him?

11:49.142 --> 11:50.510
No, he was wearing
a ski mask.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.246
Says here that she was
the last one he attacked.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.815
Serial killers
don't just stop.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.483
They either die or get popped
for another crime.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.251
Pull records for men
who were arrested

11:58.285 --> 11:59.386
after Jeanette was attacked,

11:59.419 --> 12:00.954
and paroled
in the last six months.

12:00.988 --> 12:04.024
How do we know
it's not a copycat?

12:04.057 --> 12:06.359
RDK taunted police
with letters,

12:06.393 --> 12:07.995
poems, and riddles.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.030
He left a distinct mark

12:10.063 --> 12:12.165
that was never released
to the public.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.867
This is a copy
of his first letter

12:13.901 --> 12:16.336
dated June 9, 1979.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.771
This is today's.

12:17.805 --> 12:18.939
(Benson)
Same symbol.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.909
First victim in '79
lost an ear

12:21.942 --> 12:23.310
and was hanged.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.278
Just like Julie Liebert.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.080
I'm assuming
the owner of the loft

12:27.114 --> 12:29.850
where Julie was found
is our newest victim?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.384
Gloria Durham, age 35,

12:31.418 --> 12:32.886
single mother.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.857
Luckily her ex had custody
of their son this week.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.158
She's a freelance
photographer.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.260
Had a session yesterday
at 6:00, never showed.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.929
(Cragen)
Any appointments earlier?

12:41.962 --> 12:45.232
Eddie Willis at 5:00.
No contact info.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.035
He was down in her book
a week ago for a consultation.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.937
Could be our guy.
Let's track him down.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.371
How was the first
number two killed?

12:51.404 --> 12:52.973
(Cragen)
Bled to death.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.808
Stabbed more than
100 times over four days.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.443
By now, he's already
torturing Gloria.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.979
(Stabler)
And the only thing
we've got to go on

12:59.012 --> 13:00.113
is "policeman's helmet."

13:00.147 --> 13:02.349
NYPD's got 40,000 cops
on the job.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.351
Police don't wear helmets,
they wear hats.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.854
Yes, you wear helmets.
It's not about us.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.321
It's a flower.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.023
What are you
babbling about?

13:10.057 --> 13:12.225
Impatiens glandulifera.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.294
It's the Latin name
for an English garden flower

13:14.327 --> 13:16.463
known as Policeman's Helmet.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.198
Think it's another anagram?

13:18.231 --> 13:20.467
I think he wants us
to find the flower.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.369
Well, all florists get their
stock from the flower mart.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.871
They'd know anybody in town
that carries them.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.605
It's 4:00 a.m.
They should be opening now.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.107
Excuse me, sir.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.242
You sell any
Policemen's Helmets today?

13:29.276 --> 13:31.578
Can't talk, wedding at 3:00,
and I'm way behind. Go!

13:31.611 --> 13:33.246
Raoul, where the hell's
my baby's breath?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.347
Stop!
Listen to me.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.883
Did you get an order
in today.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.484
Of what?!
Policeman's Helmets.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.385
This morning.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.220
The phone was ringing
when I came in.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.221
How was it paid for?

13:41.254 --> 13:42.422
Credit card.
Good, pull it.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.992
Pull it now.
Oh...

13:45.025 --> 13:47.294
Raoul, please don't
crush my peonies.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.561
We need his name
and address, let's go.

13:48.595 --> 13:52.132
I heard you.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.533
Hers.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.535
Gloria Durham.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.904
Son of a bitch.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.305
He used the victim's
own credit card.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.873
Where was it delivered?
Hasn't been.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.541
I told you, we're
insanely behind.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.043
My truck's
loading up now.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.144
We'll save you
the trouble.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.879
There is no 2923.

14:05.913 --> 14:09.382
He gave us a vacant lot.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.151
He gave us
a community garden.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.621
And a broken lock.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.028
He's pulled up
every last flower.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.263
A lot of upturned dirt.
Maybe he buried her.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.631
It's not one
of his M.O.s.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.034
Check out the shed.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.538
Think we found
our missing flowers.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.309
And our missing girl.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.215
It's Gloria.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.486
We were supposed to have
four days, you prick!

14:50.257 --> 14:53.126
There's multiple
stab wounds.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.661
This is right
by the book.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.029
And another clue.

14:56.063 --> 14:56.930
Where?

14:56.964 --> 14:58.598
Soles of her feet.
Looks like doodling.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.935
Some kind of animal
and a...

15:01.969 --> 15:03.570
stick man
with a striped shirt.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.105
What's that
supposed to be?

15:05.138 --> 15:06.573
A road map
to another dead body.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.341
Hold on.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.277
There's something else here.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.149
Today's newspaper.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.051
With a note on the back.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.227
He didn't screw
either one of them.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.495
All of his victims
are raped.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.597
RDK: rape,
dismember, kill.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.332
That was 25 years ago.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.601
A guy can develop a lot
of sexual dysfunctions

15:34.634 --> 15:35.735
in a quarter
of a century.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.337
Were there semen
on the original murders?

15:37.370 --> 15:38.438
Every one.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.440
Unfortunately, we didn't
have the technology back then

15:40.473 --> 15:42.409
to do anything with it.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.710
Original second victim--

15:43.743 --> 15:47.580
exsanguinated
from 132 stab wounds.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.781
That detail
was never released.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.483
Gloria was stabbed
the same number of times,

15:50.517 --> 15:51.985
but that's not
what killed her.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.686
He throat was slit.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.523
These stab wounds were
all inflicted post-mortem.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.325
Changing up his M.O.
to screw with us?

15:58.358 --> 16:00.093
What can you tell us
about the weapon?

16:00.127 --> 16:02.529
Thin, sharp,
very short blade.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.364
CSU thought that he
used a box cutter

16:04.397 --> 16:05.532
to shred the panties
in the park.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.500
Skin is a little more telling.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.503
I'd say something
even smaller, like a scalpel.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.072
He leave anything
on her hair...fibers?

16:12.105 --> 16:13.606
Just the ink
on her feet.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.608
Well, I am through
playing his games.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.644
I say we pull
the old case file

16:17.677 --> 16:19.679
and re-interview
the surviving victim.

16:22.549 --> 16:25.618
He stuck a knife
to my throat

16:25.652 --> 16:28.655
and dragged me
in an alley.

16:28.688 --> 16:32.192
He kept the knife
at my throat

16:32.225 --> 16:35.428
the entire time
he was raping me.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.598
He started whispering
in my ear

16:38.631 --> 16:41.634
how I was going to die
when he was done.

16:41.668 --> 16:46.439
I can--I can still
smell the gasoline.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.507
It was in a...

16:47.540 --> 16:50.043
soda bottle.

16:50.077 --> 16:53.680
He started to pour it
on me.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.482
I grabbed the bottle

16:55.515 --> 16:59.652
and splashed some
in his eyes.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.388
I took off running,

17:01.421 --> 17:04.757
trying to scream,
but I couldn't.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.327
He cut my throat.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.433
When did you find out
it was RDK?

17:13.466 --> 17:15.235
When I got the poem.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.470
It came in the mail
three days later

17:17.504 --> 17:19.239
with my compact.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.810
When I got home
from the hospital,

17:23.843 --> 17:25.512
it was waiting for me.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.415
The police told me
what the symbol meant.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.651
"Ode to the one
who got away."

17:31.684 --> 17:33.253
RDK's mark.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.821
So he got your purse
during the attack.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.456
Everything was in it.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.426
My driver's license,
the house key.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.628
I moved out that day.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.663
But I'm still terrified
that he'll find me.

17:43.696 --> 17:47.200
You need to know
that he's resurfaced.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.252
Oh, God.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.687
What do I do?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.422
You found me.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.757
The reporter found me.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.325
What reporter?

18:12.359 --> 18:14.194
The one who did
the article last month

18:14.227 --> 18:17.697
about the 25th anniversary
of the murders.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.765
I didn't see that story.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.667
Neither did I.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.203
I still think
I have his card.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.405
He was very polite.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.375
He told me I reminded him
of his mother.

18:28.408 --> 18:31.544
Blane Lawson,
the New York Examiner.

18:31.578 --> 18:32.812
Miss Henley,

18:32.845 --> 18:35.248
is there someplace else
that you can stay?

18:35.282 --> 18:37.250
I have a sister in Queens.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.386
Why don't you
give her a call?

18:39.419 --> 18:42.822
The reporter--
did you show him that poem?

18:42.855 --> 18:44.391
Yes.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.559
Okay.

18:46.593 --> 18:47.760
Lawson saw that mark.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.497
Three weeks before
RDK's big comeback.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.737
Yeah, we got a Blane Lawson
on staff.

18:57.770 --> 18:58.805
Works Metro.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.473
What can you
tell us about him?

19:00.507 --> 19:02.642
Real scrapper, always
brings home the story.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.212
This is crap.
Rewrite it.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.547
We understand he was
working a piece on RDK.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.549
Serial killer
from the late '70s.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.717
He never mentioned it.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.819
Lawson!
Yeah.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.387
That's Blane?

19:14.421 --> 19:15.422
Yeah.
Never mind.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.656
No, the reporter
we're looking for

19:16.689 --> 19:18.258
is a white guy,
mid-40s,

19:18.291 --> 19:19.526
short, pasty.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.428
That describes
most of my reporters.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.429
Well, the victim
that he interviewed

19:22.462 --> 19:26.299
said that he had thick,
black-rimmed glasses.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.535
That sounds like
one of our researchers.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.270
Humphrey Becker.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.404
Works in the morgue.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.876
Look at this.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.711
It's what they use
to cut out articles.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.713
Exacto knife?

19:40.747 --> 19:42.549
It's like a scalpel.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.750
Matches the weapon used

19:43.783 --> 19:46.453
to slice up
the park victim's panties.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.421
And victim number two.

19:48.455 --> 19:49.556
(Woman)
May I help you?

19:49.589 --> 19:51.424
Yeah, hi.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.360
We're looking
for, uh, Humphrey.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.563
He's on vacation
this week.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.332
What's he like
to work with?

19:59.366 --> 20:00.667
Oh, a real inspiration.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.802
He's a constant reminder
not to get stuck down here

20:02.835 --> 20:04.103
for 20 years, like him.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.373
(Stabler)
You ever get
a bad vibe off him?

20:06.406 --> 20:07.374
He's a miserable
human being.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.642
Never says a word,
just stares.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.943
Creeps me out.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.413
Have any idea what he's
doing on vacation this week?

20:13.446 --> 20:15.415
Probably sitting alone
in his apartment.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.749
Finishing off
one of those puzzle books

20:16.783 --> 20:18.518
he's always working on.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.320
Our perp has
a penchant for puzzles.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.489
Puzzles give him
a smug sense of victory,

20:22.522 --> 20:24.591
possibly to bolster
a low self-esteem.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.559
Maybe from
failing art class.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.861
These are the symbols
he drew on the victim's feet.

20:28.895 --> 20:29.696
It's a rebus.

20:29.729 --> 20:30.930
These pictures should
string together

20:30.963 --> 20:32.332
to spell out our clue.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.700
He's made murder
into a game.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.001
By giving us clues,

20:35.034 --> 20:36.536
he's absolving himself
of responsibility.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.438
If they die, it's not
his fault, it's ours.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.372
I got something!

20:39.406 --> 20:41.574
These lines from the skunk
could be scent.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.411
Scent, oar.
Center!

20:44.444 --> 20:46.546
Next clue's
at the center or something.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.680
Or some kind of center.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.316
These waves could be

20:49.349 --> 20:51.518
ocean or sea
next to a cross.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.353
That's not a cross.
That's a small "T"--seat!

20:53.386 --> 20:55.054
Seat!
This little
stick figure in stripes.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.523
This is a con.
We figure he's done time.

20:56.556 --> 20:57.524
Maybe that's him.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.559
Interconnected circles.
Could that be a chain?

20:59.592 --> 21:01.394
But the arrow points
to an individual link.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.963
Link con?
Lincoln Center!

21:03.996 --> 21:05.197
Lincoln Center.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.534
Our next clue is under one
of the seats at Lincoln Center.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.469
There are more than a dozen
concert halls at Lincoln Center.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.371
You're talking
thousands of seats.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.439
Take all available
manpower.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.540
Got it, Captain!

21:13.573 --> 21:14.607
Where's Benson and Sabler?

21:14.641 --> 21:16.376
They're executing
a search warrant

21:16.409 --> 21:17.444
on the puzzle master.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.078
Go! Go! Go! Go!

21:19.111 --> 21:20.680
Police!

21:23.015 --> 21:24.617
(ESU)
Clear!

21:24.651 --> 21:26.085
He's got
quite a book collection.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.788
(Benson)
They're all mysteries.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.658
(Benson)
And he takes care
of 'em: humidifiers.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.494
(Benson)
He steals
from libraries.

21:34.527 --> 21:37.930
And collects
night lights.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.732
A serial killing
kleptomaniac

21:39.766 --> 21:42.068
who's afraid of the dark.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.337
Interesting choice
of wallpaper.

21:44.371 --> 21:45.572
They're all
from publishers.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.541
"As we explained
in our previous letter,

21:48.575 --> 21:50.810
we do not accept
unsolicited manuscripts."

21:50.843 --> 21:51.944
This is weird.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.614
He's taken the doors
off all the closets.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.716
These are all
rejection letters.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.751
Why would he put them
up on his walls?

21:58.785 --> 22:00.019
He's insane?

22:00.052 --> 22:01.821
Check this out.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.790
This is dated
two months ago

22:03.823 --> 22:07.627
regarding a book proposal
on serial killer RDK.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.495
Nice timing.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.463
It wasn't then.
Turned him down flat.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.765
"At this time,
we are only in the market

22:12.799 --> 22:16.936
for recent,
high-profile cases."

22:16.969 --> 22:19.572
Like the return of RDK.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.574
So this Humphrey
is just some crackpot

22:21.608 --> 22:23.142
pretending to be RDK?

22:23.175 --> 22:24.511
It's looking that way.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.012
He never made it home.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.814
I think he made us.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.582
Or he's out
stalking his next victim.

22:29.616 --> 22:31.618
Guy never sleeps.
I know we haven't in two days.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.686
Gotta suck down some coffee,
do some push-ups.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.455
Our only hope
is to get ahead of him.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.623
Captain.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.057
What did you find
at Lincoln Center?

22:38.090 --> 22:39.859
18,900 seats.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.661
Not counting
the toilets.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.530
Which is where he hid
the next clue

22:43.563 --> 22:45.465
in his demented
little scavenger hunt.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.332
And where'd that
take you?

22:46.365 --> 22:47.567
Fun House
at Coney Island,

22:47.600 --> 22:48.968
which was anything but.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.069
Which took us
to an obscure book

22:50.102 --> 22:51.170
on the Dead Sea Scrolls

22:51.203 --> 22:52.171
at the city library.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.541
(Fin)
We found a note
inside the dust jacket.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.643
"If you found this,
you deserve a reward.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.945
"I won't grab
another girl till Thursday,

22:58.978 --> 23:01.047
so relax
and take in a show."

23:01.080 --> 23:03.716
Which means he hasn't taken
victim number three yet.

23:03.750 --> 23:04.584
It's 20 to nine.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.653
Thursday's here
in less than four hours.

23:06.686 --> 23:07.920
That one is easy.

23:07.954 --> 23:10.423
The clue is
"take in a show."

23:10.457 --> 23:12.024
The original third victim
was a chorus girl.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.159
Do you know
how many musicals

23:13.192 --> 23:14.461
are on Broadway
right now?

23:14.494 --> 23:16.095
The curtains went up
40 minutes ago.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.664
This may be
a long shot,

23:17.697 --> 23:19.632
but, unlike
the original RDK,

23:19.666 --> 23:21.901
all of Humphrey's victims
are mothers.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.169
(Benson)
Of little boys.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.137
To know that, he would
have had to screen 'em.

23:25.171 --> 23:26.473
Hit the theater district.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.840
Talk to dancers with sons.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.211
John?

23:32.244 --> 23:33.680
The original story on RDK

23:33.713 --> 23:35.915
was broken by a reporter
at the Examiner.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.984
That's Humphrey's paper.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.720
(Cragen)
Could explain how he
got to Jeanette Henley.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.523
Track down this reporter,
this Morty Graf.

23:43.556 --> 23:44.624
All right.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.632
So, how'd you get all those
RDK scoops back then?

23:52.665 --> 23:54.634
By working long,
hard hours.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.168
Drinking
with the detectives.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.870
They ever release
the number of stab wounds

23:57.904 --> 23:58.938
in the second victim?

23:58.971 --> 24:00.673
No, that I charmed
out of little cutie

24:00.707 --> 24:01.941
in the M.E.'s office.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.776
You mind lighting me up,
sweetheart?

24:03.810 --> 24:05.878
You ever print
that detail?

24:05.912 --> 24:10.149
Tried--damn editor came down
with a case of ethics.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.884
So your notebooks
at the paper--

24:11.918 --> 24:13.520
you left them there
when you retired?

24:13.553 --> 24:15.688
Hell, no.
Those get buried with me.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.724
But your research assistant,
Humphrey Becker,

24:17.757 --> 24:19.225
he would have had
access to them, right?

24:19.258 --> 24:21.661
No, but funny
you should bring him up.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.096
Unfortunately,
the guy's a member here.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.098
I thought you only let in
published authors.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.667
He lied
through his ass.

24:27.700 --> 24:28.935
Claimed to be a member

24:28.968 --> 24:31.704
of the Mystery Writers
of America.

24:31.738 --> 24:32.705
Plus, they were desperate.

24:32.739 --> 24:34.774
They just lost a bunch
of long-time members.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.109
Cancer?

24:37.143 --> 24:38.811
Hey, the only thing
killing off members here

24:38.845 --> 24:40.079
is being pestered
by Humphrey.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.948
He's always pumping me
for old cases.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.182
Like RDK?

24:43.215 --> 24:44.917
Don't get me started.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.686
Damn thing's stale.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.955
I got a fresh stash
in my locker.

24:50.557 --> 24:53.059
Locker?
Does Humphrey have one?

24:53.092 --> 24:56.729
Yeah.
Everybody's got one.

24:59.065 --> 25:01.167
I just set a new world record
getting these warrants,

25:01.200 --> 25:02.802
not to mention
risking my life

25:02.835 --> 25:05.071
interrupting Judge Terhune's
poker game again.

25:05.104 --> 25:06.205
Open it.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.741
Poor baby.
I've been up 40 hours.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.044
See what we got here.

25:12.078 --> 25:15.281
Cigars,
more cheap cigars.

25:15.314 --> 25:16.716
Bingo!

25:16.749 --> 25:18.751
We got journals.

25:21.320 --> 25:25.191
This one's a proposal
for a Ripper book.

25:25.224 --> 25:27.794
This one's just full
of story ideas, bad ones.

25:27.827 --> 25:32.965
This one's a how-to book
on taking over RDK's identity.

25:32.999 --> 25:35.067
It's a diagram
of Central Park running path.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.169
Yeah, complete with descriptions
of women with babies,

25:37.203 --> 25:38.771
all boys.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.840
This one sounds like
Julie Liebert.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.575
This guy
does his research.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.210
Skip to the third victim.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.078
Got a long list
of musicals here.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.880
Here's one starred.
Prairie Days.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.015
This is it!

25:49.048 --> 25:50.783
"Leggy redhead.
Two-year-old named Jake.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.652
Stage name, Red Watts."

25:52.685 --> 25:54.654
She's number three!

25:56.989 --> 25:58.958
Red!
Yeah?

25:58.991 --> 26:00.727
(Stabler) Boy, are we
glad to see you.

26:00.760 --> 26:01.861
You need to come with us.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.863
What, are you crazy?
I'm in the finale.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.031
Is this your son Jake?

26:05.064 --> 26:06.799
How'd you
know his name?

26:06.833 --> 26:08.234
We'll swing by,
pick him up,

26:08.267 --> 26:10.336
but we need to get you
someplace safe now.

26:10.369 --> 26:11.638
What are you
talking about?

26:11.671 --> 26:13.072
Have you ever
seen this man before?

26:13.105 --> 26:14.641
Yeah, last week.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.909
He was waiting outside
the stage door for an autograph.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.678
Did he ask you
about your son?

26:18.711 --> 26:20.312
Oh, my God.
He did.

26:20.346 --> 26:21.748
Benson!
Did he hurt Jake?!

26:21.781 --> 26:23.249
No, no, no.
Jake's not the one in danger.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.718
You just get changed.
We'll explain in the car.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.086
Where you going?

26:27.119 --> 26:29.889
Jeanette Henley
never made it to her sister's.

26:47.239 --> 26:51.043
Possible abduction
at 38 West 84th Street.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.880
Request backup,
apartment 9G.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.970
Jeanette?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.942
Jeanette?

27:30.717 --> 27:32.719
Congratulations.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.420
You caught me.

27:34.453 --> 27:35.922
What are you doing here?

27:35.955 --> 27:38.290
I needed
a place to sleep.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.359
You people were all over
my apartment.

27:40.392 --> 27:43.062
I figured this spot
was as good as any.

27:43.095 --> 27:46.966
Now that it's, um, vacant.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.001
Where's Jeanette?

27:49.035 --> 27:53.906
Sorry, she's a little
buried at the moment.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.184
We need you
in there now.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.252
What's he said?

28:06.285 --> 28:07.854
He buried her alive.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.421
Doesn't make sense.
RDK never did that.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.057
He'll only talk
to the lead detective.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.892
What about Liv?
Wants it man to man.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.093
This popped on
his credit card.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.828
He bought an oxygen tank
yesterday.

28:15.862 --> 28:16.628
He's letting her breathe?

28:16.662 --> 28:18.765
Not for long.
15-hour capacity.

28:18.798 --> 28:20.166
She's possibly
gone though half of it.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.734
Found his car
inside of Jeanette's.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.135
Anything in it?
No, but maybe we can tell

28:23.169 --> 28:24.470
where he took her
from the tires.

28:24.503 --> 28:25.738
Can't wait for lab results.

28:25.772 --> 28:27.073
Victims four and five
are safe.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.241
Wait, we need
a game plan.

28:29.275 --> 28:30.943
No time.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.514
Where is she?

28:35.547 --> 28:36.849
Huh?

28:36.883 --> 28:38.785
Oh.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.920
Sorry.
I must have dozed off.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.855
[grunts]

28:42.889 --> 28:44.757
Tell me...

28:44.791 --> 28:47.526
is it true
only the guilty sleep?

28:47.559 --> 28:49.028
Yeah, it is.

28:49.061 --> 28:52.899
Well, then,
I guess you got me.

28:52.932 --> 28:56.969
But in my own defense,
I must say I am just pooped.

28:59.005 --> 29:02.074
Oh, my, oh, my,
look at the time.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.509
You must be, too.

29:03.542 --> 29:05.211
Well, I haven't slept
in two days.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.479
I know,
but wasn't it fun?

29:07.513 --> 29:09.215
No.
No, actually, it wasn't.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.984
And in case you
haven't heard, you lost.

29:12.018 --> 29:14.486
And yet,
and yet, and yet,

29:14.520 --> 29:17.156
where in the world
is Jeanette?

29:17.189 --> 29:18.958
I guarantee
you're gonna tell me.

29:18.991 --> 29:21.393
Oh, I get it.

29:21.427 --> 29:22.995
Bad cop.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.563
Okay, fine.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.932
But remember the rules:

29:25.965 --> 29:28.167
you don't get a good cop
to play off of.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.902
No help
from the peanut gallery.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.171
I don't need any help.

29:32.204 --> 29:34.173
Who are you kidding?

29:34.206 --> 29:36.876
I'm a big fish.

29:36.909 --> 29:42.081
I'm sure the entire department's
right behind that mirror.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.917
Hello.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.485
If I'm stuck in here,

29:46.518 --> 29:47.486
so is he.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.889
Anyone walks
in or out that door,

29:49.922 --> 29:52.124
game's over.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.292
I'll play.

29:53.325 --> 29:54.861
Good.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.229
I'm the final clue.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.598
Think you're smart enough
to get it out of me?

29:59.631 --> 30:01.868
One way or another.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.002
Oh.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.170
I must warn you,

30:04.203 --> 30:06.572
I am going to be
quite the challenge.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.908
I know every trick
in the book.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.943
I've written 27 of them.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.979
I know, I saw
your rejection letters.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.049
Maybe I'll take
another nap now.

30:18.885 --> 30:21.353
[cell phone rings]

30:23.422 --> 30:25.925
Uh, yeah, baby,
I'm kind of working right here.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.059
What's up?

30:27.093 --> 30:29.161
Belittling him
is only gonna shut him down.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.930
He obviously
wanted to get caught.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.999
He craves attention
and recognition.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.566
Play to his vanity.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.869
He's been a loser
all his life.

30:36.903 --> 30:37.870
Give him his 15 minutes.

30:37.904 --> 30:40.973
I'll try, but I'm
a little pressed for time.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.875
Love you, too.
Bye-bye.

30:42.909 --> 30:45.011
Who was that?

30:45.044 --> 30:46.112
My wife.

30:46.145 --> 30:47.446
I'm sorry.

30:47.479 --> 30:50.616
No, I'm sorry
that you find me so boring.

30:50.649 --> 30:51.918
Boring? No.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.120
I don't find you
boring at all.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.288
Then turn off
the damn phone!

30:58.925 --> 31:00.927
Sorry.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.494
You know, I think
you misunderstood

31:02.528 --> 31:04.030
what I said
back there.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.098
About what?
Your books.

31:06.132 --> 31:07.666
You wrote 27 of them.

31:07.699 --> 31:11.037
That takes a lot of time
and effort.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.472
I'd be flattered if you'd
actually read one.

31:13.505 --> 31:14.340
I'd like to.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.143
This whole plot that you
cooked up here.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.078
Very clever.

31:19.111 --> 31:20.512
Clever.
[chuckles]

31:20.546 --> 31:21.647
It was brilliant.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.614
Okay, brilliant.

31:22.648 --> 31:25.151
It's a shame about
the Son of Sam law, though.

31:25.184 --> 31:26.318
What do you mean?

31:26.352 --> 31:28.287
The book is obviously
gonna be a bestseller,

31:28.320 --> 31:31.690
but unfortunately you can't
profit off your own crimes.

31:31.723 --> 31:35.527
No, no, no.
It's...

31:35.561 --> 31:36.996
It's not about the money.

31:37.029 --> 31:41.267
What's it about?

31:41.300 --> 31:43.635
Proving them all wrong.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.104
Becoming famous.

31:45.137 --> 31:46.305
You're on your way there.

31:46.338 --> 31:47.639
You think?
I do.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.141
Serial killers
are very popular.

31:49.175 --> 31:51.410
Yeah, yeah.

31:51.443 --> 31:54.280
I'm going to be a legend.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.648
That'll show her.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.184
Her?

31:59.551 --> 32:00.619
Them.

32:00.652 --> 32:03.089
Those small-minded
publishers.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.191
You said "her."

32:05.224 --> 32:07.059
Well, I'm done
talking now.

32:07.093 --> 32:08.127
Come on, Humphrey!

32:08.160 --> 32:09.261
Come on, don't do that.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.130
Let's talk about you now.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.099
I guess you're just gonna
have to buy my book.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.034
Okay, just tell me this.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.973
Your next victim was supposed
to be the chorus girl.

32:21.007 --> 32:22.274
Why skip to Jeanette?

32:24.010 --> 32:25.344
[sighs]

32:25.377 --> 32:28.714
Because you figured out
who I was.

32:28.747 --> 32:33.219
I was forced to jump ahead
to my piece de resistance.

32:33.252 --> 32:34.320
RDK's original
sixth victim.

32:34.353 --> 32:35.387
Yes.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.023
The one that got away.

32:37.056 --> 32:39.058
She eluded him,
but not me.

32:39.091 --> 32:40.659
Well, she's 65 years old.

32:43.162 --> 32:46.132
Not looking good for 66.

32:47.599 --> 32:50.036
[buzzing sound]

32:50.069 --> 32:52.771
Why, detective,
is that your phone vibrating,

32:52.804 --> 32:55.274
or do you just find me
terribly exciting?

32:55.307 --> 32:57.576
911 from the wife.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.011
I talked to Novak.

32:59.045 --> 33:00.446
He gives us her location,

33:00.479 --> 33:02.214
she'll take the death penalty
off the table.

33:02.248 --> 33:03.482
Oh, I don't know.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.551
You know how I hate
letting the kids get away

33:05.584 --> 33:06.618
with that kind of thing.

33:06.652 --> 33:07.719
Okay, bye-bye.

33:07.753 --> 33:10.156
Oh, no "I love you"
this time?

33:10.189 --> 33:13.292
It rings one more time,
and we're done!

33:13.325 --> 33:15.561
As is Jeanette!

33:15.594 --> 33:18.130
Okay, look, you win!
You win everything.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.565
And what exactly
do I win, detective?

33:19.598 --> 33:21.033
How about your life?

33:21.067 --> 33:22.634
Tell us where Jeanette is,

33:22.668 --> 33:24.503
and we take the death penalty
off the table.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.405
You don't have the authority
to do that.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.174
I'll give it to you
in writing.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.209
Okay, well,
just to clarify,

33:30.242 --> 33:32.211
what if I do tell you
where she is

33:32.244 --> 33:34.280
but she's sucked up
all the oxygen

33:34.313 --> 33:35.381
and died on us?

33:35.414 --> 33:37.149
How much air
is left in the tank?

33:37.183 --> 33:40.819
Technically,
four hours, 28 minutes,

33:40.852 --> 33:46.592
and 30, 28,
27, 26 seconds.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.328
Assuming she's
breathing normally.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.531
Of course, people do tend
to breathe harder

33:52.564 --> 33:53.665
when they're panicked.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.567
There's no reason
to do this to her.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.503
She must be
so frightened

33:57.536 --> 34:00.172
in that small,
cramped space.

34:00.206 --> 34:03.142
I wonder if her eyes
have adjusted to the dark.

34:03.175 --> 34:08.280
If so, she can see the needle
on the tank approaching empty.

34:10.816 --> 34:12.484
Ohh!

34:12.518 --> 34:14.153
You want to talk to me
man to man?

34:14.186 --> 34:15.821
You're no man--you just
attack helpless women.

34:15.854 --> 34:17.356
Now, you're gonna tell me
where Jeanette is,

34:17.389 --> 34:19.258
or I'm gonna choke
the life out of you.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.159
Do it!

34:20.192 --> 34:22.194
[grunting]

34:22.228 --> 34:23.429
Come here.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.200
How does that feel?

34:28.234 --> 34:31.637
No air in your lungs.
How does that feel now?

34:31.670 --> 34:34.673
Now, you're gonna tell me
where Jeanette is, you freak.

34:34.706 --> 34:37.243
Elliot, stop it!
Come on, stop it!

34:37.276 --> 34:39.778
Let go.
Let go.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.113
Five minutes with him.

34:41.147 --> 34:42.581
Let's go!
Let's go!

34:42.614 --> 34:44.416
Just when we were
starting to have fun.

34:44.450 --> 34:46.452
Game's over, detective!
You lose.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.154
You broke the rules.
You brought in help.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.488
He didn't.
I'm a doctor.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.257
I'm here to help you.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.324
[panting]

34:52.358 --> 34:53.592
Can you breathe all right?

34:53.625 --> 34:56.328
Yeah.
I'm fine.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.797
What about Jeanette?

34:58.830 --> 35:00.699
She was dead when you
buried her, wasn't she?

35:00.732 --> 35:01.733
[chuckles]

35:01.767 --> 35:05.871
Quite the contrary.
She was alive and kicking.

35:05.904 --> 35:08.240
I believe you.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.777
What is that, huh?

35:11.810 --> 35:14.180
Poor man's
lie detector test?

35:14.213 --> 35:18.150
Taking my pulse while
you interrogate me, detective?

35:18.184 --> 35:19.351
I'm not a detective.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.153
And I'm not stupid.

35:21.187 --> 35:22.321
I really am a doctor.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.890
And I'm also
with the F.B.I.

35:29.261 --> 35:33.665
They brought you in here
to profile me.

35:33.699 --> 35:36.335
We've got
a whole team on you.

35:36.368 --> 35:39.338
Really?

35:39.371 --> 35:42.808
And what are they
saying about me?

35:42.841 --> 35:45.477
That you're impotent.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.546
I told them
that they were wrong.

35:50.216 --> 35:52.651
Now, why would they
say that?

35:52.684 --> 35:55.321
Because you mimicked RDK
in every detail,

35:55.354 --> 35:57.223
except that RDK's victims
were all raped,

35:57.256 --> 35:58.624
and yours weren't.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.759
They have no idea
what I did to those women.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.261
Well, you didn't
rape them.

36:02.294 --> 36:03.762
And I know why.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.331
Do tell.

36:05.364 --> 36:06.332
Because it would have
been like

36:06.365 --> 36:07.333
having sex
with your mother.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.835
What are you
talking about?

36:09.868 --> 36:12.338
You targeted women
with children.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.606
You told Jeanette she reminded
you of your mother.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.842
You let those little boys
go unharmed

36:16.875 --> 36:18.310
because they were
innocents.

36:18.344 --> 36:20.379
Do we know if the mother
is still alive?

36:20.412 --> 36:22.348
I'll find out.

36:22.381 --> 36:23.949
(Humphrey)
How disappointing.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.252
And you look so smart.

36:26.285 --> 36:27.986
You have a deep-seated rage
against women,

36:28.019 --> 36:31.223
and yet you identify
with their sons.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.891
What did your mother
do to you?

36:32.924 --> 36:34.293
Please.

36:34.326 --> 36:36.628
With you people,
it's always the mother.

36:37.996 --> 36:40.566
There must be some mistake.
This isn't my Humphrey.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.534
Captain,
this is Mrs. Becker.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.736
Ida.
Everyone calls me Ida.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.738
Even Humphrey,
since he was five.

36:46.772 --> 36:47.506
Thank you for coming,
ma'am.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.708
Sorry to drag you
out in the rain.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.643
Oh, it stopped
on the way over.

36:51.677 --> 36:52.444
Right this way, ma'am.

36:52.478 --> 36:54.313
It doesn't make sense,
you know.

36:54.346 --> 36:56.782
He was destined
for such great things.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.418
I named him
after a legend.

36:59.451 --> 37:00.619
Bogart.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.288
Wasn't he wonderful?

37:02.321 --> 37:03.655
Mrs. Becker was
just telling me

37:03.689 --> 37:06.024
that she hasn't seen her son
in over 25 years.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.726
You had a falling out?

37:07.759 --> 37:09.728
Over the scandal.
Ugh!

37:09.761 --> 37:13.532
I worked 2 jobs to put him
through journalism school.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.801
He was gonna be a reporter,
just like Bogie

37:15.834 --> 37:17.769
in his final film,
The Harder They Fall.

37:17.803 --> 37:18.670
You mentioned
a scandal?

37:18.704 --> 37:22.674
Ohh, he plagiarized
his honors thesis.

37:22.708 --> 37:25.010
All my hard work,
out the window.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.612
He was thrown out.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.814
You know,
just disgraced.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.682
We really, really
need to get you in there.

37:30.716 --> 37:31.683
Oh, yeah, sure.

37:31.717 --> 37:33.985
Anything I can do to help.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.359
Humphrey?

37:40.392 --> 37:41.560
What's happened
to you?

37:41.593 --> 37:43.094
Ida?

37:43.128 --> 37:45.931
(Stabler)
You two must have
a lot of catching up to do.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.699
Here, have a seat,
Mrs. Becker.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.536
Your hair!

37:50.569 --> 37:52.304
What did you do to it?

37:52.338 --> 37:55.441
Y-you haven't
changed a bit.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.943
You should have seen him
when he was little.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.578
Head full of curls.

37:59.611 --> 38:03.415
Um, they're not interested
in my childhood.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.417
Oh...but we are.

38:05.451 --> 38:07.486
Nice play.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.888
You mind giving us
a few minutes alone?

38:09.921 --> 38:11.690
Sorry.
Against my rules.

38:11.723 --> 38:12.858
Humphrey...

38:12.891 --> 38:15.561
tell them where
you put the lady.

38:15.594 --> 38:17.663
Um, stay out of this, Ida.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.698
Why, when she's such
a big part of it?

38:19.731 --> 38:22.601
Okay...

38:22.634 --> 38:25.471
You want to know
where she is, Ida?

38:25.504 --> 38:27.539
She's In A Lonely Place.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.575
Ready for The Big Sleep.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.610
Those are Bogie films.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.745
You're a disgrace
to his name.

38:33.779 --> 38:36.415
You like that?
You're gonna love this.

38:36.448 --> 38:39.851
One of the aliases I used
was Eddie Willis.

38:39.885 --> 38:43.789
Bogie's last role.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.123
I knew you'd be pleased.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.625
Why don't you
tell your mother

38:46.658 --> 38:47.959
what you've
been up to lately?

38:47.993 --> 38:50.462
Why don't you shut
your damn pie hole?

38:50.496 --> 38:51.530
Language.

38:51.563 --> 38:54.433
You know how I feel
about curse words.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.635
Even when Bogie
played a bad guy,

38:56.668 --> 38:58.069
he never worked blue.

38:58.103 --> 38:59.605
Sorry, Ida.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.473
Didn't mean
to disappoint you...

39:01.507 --> 39:02.974
yet again.

39:03.008 --> 39:04.610
I should be used to it.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.745
I had such high hopes
for him.

39:06.778 --> 39:07.979
Well, it was nice visiting.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.649
You were supposed
to grow up

39:10.682 --> 39:11.917
to be somebody.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.385
I'm sitting right here.

39:13.419 --> 39:14.586
In a police station.

39:16.488 --> 39:20.158
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing this is for me?

39:20.191 --> 39:22.661
I did this for you, Ida.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.596
I'm finally
going to be famous,

39:24.630 --> 39:26.898
just like
you always wanted.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.634
Happy now?

39:28.667 --> 39:31.537
You were never anything
but trouble.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.638
He was a difficult child?

39:32.671 --> 39:34.540
You can't imagine.

39:34.573 --> 39:35.807
Shut up, Ida.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.676
I couldn't take him
anywhere!

39:37.709 --> 39:39.478
Not even my movies.

39:39.511 --> 39:40.646
Shut up.

39:40.679 --> 39:41.680
Soon as the lights
went down,

39:41.713 --> 39:42.948
he'd throw a tantrum!
Stop it.

39:42.981 --> 39:43.982
He's afraid of the dark?

39:44.015 --> 39:46.518
He was a crybaby!
Stop it!

39:46.552 --> 39:48.687
He'd cry like a baby
till they'd ask us to leave.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.922
Oh, you sure in hell
figured out a way to see 'em.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.458
How did you
manage that, Ida.

39:52.491 --> 39:53.792
Never mind!
I'd like to know.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.927
What else could I do?
I had to leave him at home.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.464
Alone?
I made sure that he
couldn't get in trouble.

39:58.497 --> 40:00.198
Shut up, Ida!
That's why you
took the doors off.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.667
She locked you
in the closet.

40:01.700 --> 40:02.801
Well, you know, he might
have hurt himself

40:02.834 --> 40:04.536
running around the house.
That's enough!

40:04.570 --> 40:06.104
It was only
for two hours.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.873
But he'd get
so worked up,

40:07.906 --> 40:09.675
he'd soil himself.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.543
Shut up!
Please!

40:11.577 --> 40:12.611
Shut up!

40:12.644 --> 40:14.946
Don't you ever shut up?!

40:14.980 --> 40:17.649
Don't you ever shut up?!

40:17.683 --> 40:19.551
I'll kill you,
you bitch!

40:19.585 --> 40:20.686
You bitch!

40:20.719 --> 40:23.221
You see how
he treats his mother.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.123
Claustrophobic.

40:25.156 --> 40:26.492
Wait!

40:26.525 --> 40:28.159
No, let me go.

40:28.193 --> 40:30.496
No!
Where are you taking me?

40:30.529 --> 40:31.697
My game room!

40:34.032 --> 40:36.702
No! No! No!

40:36.735 --> 40:38.069
Please! Don't!

40:38.103 --> 40:39.638
You need another clue?

40:39.671 --> 40:42.173
Wouldn't want to leave you
in the dark.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.676
No, please!
Please, you can't do this!

40:44.710 --> 40:46.845
Relax, Humphrey.
It's just a game!

40:46.878 --> 40:48.714
Let me out!

40:48.747 --> 40:50.081
Tell us where
Jeanette is!

40:50.115 --> 40:51.783
Let me out,
and I'll tell you!

40:51.817 --> 40:53.552
You tell me,
I'll let you out!

40:53.585 --> 40:54.953
Thought you
could use this.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.655
(Humphrey)
Please, I can't breathe.

40:56.688 --> 40:57.989
Where is she?

40:58.023 --> 41:00.692
Where is she?!

41:00.726 --> 41:03.061
In a dump in Staten Island.

41:03.094 --> 41:06.197
In a refrigerator
with a chain around it.

41:06.231 --> 41:07.933
Now please let me out!

41:07.966 --> 41:09.067
Jeanette first!

41:09.100 --> 41:11.637
I'll call ESU.

41:13.004 --> 41:14.105
Open it!

41:23.715 --> 41:24.916
(Benson)
She alive?

41:24.950 --> 41:26.518
Barely breathing.

41:26.552 --> 41:29.621
Needle's on the red.
She's almost out.

41:29.655 --> 41:31.790
[groans]

41:33.725 --> 41:35.026
[panting]

41:35.060 --> 41:36.695
He found me.

41:36.728 --> 41:38.630
I told you
he'd find me.

41:38.664 --> 41:39.898
You're safe now.

41:39.931 --> 41:41.066
He'll get out.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.668
I just know it.

41:42.701 --> 41:44.102
He'll never stop

41:44.135 --> 41:46.738
till he gets me.

41:46.772 --> 41:50.809
Believe me,
he'll never get out, never.
