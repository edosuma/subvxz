22:38.324 --> 22:39.823
                 I think I know
               what I did wrong.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.495
        <i> Lahalabah hear my shame</i>

22:44.497 --> 22:46.897
              <i> Return the spell</i>
            <i> From whence it came</i>

22:46.899 --> 22:48.732
   From whence it came?
                      Shh.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.367
                   <i> Listen now</i>
                <i> And listen well</i>

22:50.369 --> 22:53.136
                  <i> Take away</i>
              <i> My master's spell</i>

22:53.138 --> 22:55.906
                        Hold it.
         Now, just be quiet.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.708
      You're gonna be just fine.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.142
I'm feeling pretty good already.

22:59.144 --> 23:01.011
                 You said he had
                 a broken wrist.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.814
Miracle of modern medicine, sir.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.182
                 You said he had
                 a broken ankle.

23:05.184 --> 23:07.083
      [STAMMERS]
I don't understand it!

23:07.085 --> 23:09.686
I'm going to recommend you both
   highly to all my friends.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.087
   What about your appendicitis?

23:11.089 --> 23:12.556
      [CHUCKLING]
  Yeah. What about it?

23:14.326 --> 23:16.827
Oh, master, you are all well.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.194
                       Yeah.
                   I feel great.

23:18.196 --> 23:19.496
Good. Look who is here.

23:19.498 --> 23:20.964
                   Huh?

23:20.966 --> 23:23.366
        "Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together here--"

23:26.939 --> 23:28.839
             "--this woman in--"
            Excuse me, sir.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.206
     Jeannie, I can't marry you.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.875
Oh, it will only
take a minute, master.

23:31.877 --> 23:33.276
              A minute.
           What time is it?

23:33.278 --> 23:34.277
     It's 5 after 5.

23:34.279 --> 23:35.879
             Five after 5?

23:35.881 --> 23:38.015
I've got to be in General Drew's
         office at 5:00.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.850
Hey, you're gonna be late.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.217
It is a very short ceremony.

23:41.219 --> 23:43.153
It will take no time at all.
Please continue.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.622
         No, I really can't--
  "When in the bloom of youth--"

23:45.624 --> 23:47.090
               Please,
         I'm terribly sorry.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.192
     They're gonna be discussing
         the Apollo project,

23:49.194 --> 23:50.193
     and I've got to be there.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.795
Well, you'll never make it now.

23:51.797 --> 23:53.897
  Jeannie, get this cast off me.
But I do not wish--

23:53.899 --> 23:55.265
            Now, come on,
          both of them. Off.

23:57.135 --> 23:59.536
        "Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together here--"

23:59.538 --> 24:01.438
             No, no, no.
           Wait, I can't.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.906
       I just-- I just can't.
             I'm sorry.

24:02.908 --> 24:04.307
           Now, get me back
           to that meeting.

24:04.309 --> 24:06.076
Oh, but master--
        Now, come on, I mean it.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.077
          Get me back there.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.845
 [GIGGLES]

24:13.786 --> 24:16.119
                Uh, I'm sorry
            I'm late, gentlemen.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.321
              I know how it must
             inconvenience you--

24:21.961 --> 24:23.326
         I-I-I'm terribly sorry.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.965
