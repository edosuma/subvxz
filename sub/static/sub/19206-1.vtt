00:02.494 --> 00:03.493
Mm?

00:03.528 --> 00:04.527
Whoa! Emmett!

00:04.562 --> 00:05.561
Wha...

00:10.435 --> 00:12.802
Travis thinks that he's in love with me.

00:19.477 --> 00:20.443
Everything okay?

00:20.478 --> 00:22.712
My parents want me to
think about moving home.

00:22.747 --> 00:24.414
To London?

00:24.449 --> 00:26.682
Toby: We would like to introduce
you to Carlton Summers Kennish.

00:26.718 --> 00:28.818
China's going to change
you, I can already tell that.

00:28.853 --> 00:31.621
I think we should take the
summer. See what happens.

00:31.656 --> 00:33.589
- You should come with me.
- To China?

00:33.625 --> 00:35.658
We'll have an adventure, you and me.

00:38.696 --> 00:41.564
(panting)

00:43.735 --> 00:45.568
Help!

00:45.603 --> 00:47.637
Someone! Please!

00:50.508 --> 00:51.541
Help!

00:57.549 --> 00:58.614
Hey! Hey!

01:00.585 --> 01:02.819
My sister, she needs a doctor.

01:04.489 --> 01:05.755
A doctor!

01:07.425 --> 01:08.825
Yeah? Yes?

01:08.860 --> 01:10.760
(panting)

01:15.800 --> 01:17.733
In there? There's a doctor there?

01:19.437 --> 01:21.669
(speaking Mandarin)

01:24.809 --> 01:25.808
Please help!

01:28.746 --> 01:30.780
She has a... a fever
and... and the chills

01:30.815 --> 01:33.549
- and she's been vomiting.
- (speaking Mandarin)

01:33.585 --> 01:35.585
We were on a hike and
she had a headache and...

01:35.620 --> 01:37.587
and then I thought it was
altitude, but it got worse.

01:37.622 --> 01:39.655
(both speaking Mandarin)

01:39.691 --> 01:41.524
Her dad had a... an aneurysm.

01:41.559 --> 01:42.692
A... a brain thing.

01:42.727 --> 01:45.495
Dammit! There's no reception!

01:46.664 --> 01:47.630
Bay: I...

01:47.665 --> 01:48.631
can't... don't know...

01:48.666 --> 01:50.466
Bay, Bay, Bay! I'm here!

01:50.502 --> 01:51.567
I'm here, Bay.

01:51.603 --> 01:52.635
I can't, I can't...

01:52.670 --> 01:53.870
Is there a hospital nearby?

01:53.905 --> 01:55.538
Can you call someone for me?

01:55.573 --> 01:57.840
Can you call a... a hospital?

01:57.876 --> 01:59.876
- Wait, what is that? What are you giving her?
- (speaking Mandarin)

01:59.911 --> 02:02.378
What? I... I don't
understand what you're saying.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.380
- (speaking Mandarin)
- I don't know what you're saying!

02:04.415 --> 02:05.815
(speaking Mandarin)

02:05.850 --> 02:07.717
Please just help her.

02:09.753 --> 02:10.786
It's okay.

02:20.698 --> 02:21.664
I'm Ling.

02:21.699 --> 02:23.566
My father sent for me.

02:23.601 --> 02:25.635
You... you speak English.

02:25.670 --> 02:26.702
Oh, thank God.

02:26.738 --> 02:28.538
Thank you so much for coming.

02:29.741 --> 02:31.541
I don't know what's going on.

02:32.710 --> 02:35.611
My father, he believes your friend is...

02:35.647 --> 02:37.380
My sister.

02:38.516 --> 02:39.582
Your sister.

02:39.617 --> 02:42.451
He believes your sister
is suffering from a virus

02:42.487 --> 02:43.853
called Japanese encephalitis.

02:43.888 --> 02:46.822
I... I'm sorry, I'm deaf.

02:46.858 --> 02:48.491
Did you say "encephalitis"?

02:48.526 --> 02:50.826
It's from a mosquito bite.

02:50.862 --> 02:53.462
Some time between five and 15 days ago.

02:53.498 --> 02:56.699
Encephalitis means
inflammation of the brain.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.571
What's the treatment?

03:02.607 --> 03:06.609
Rest, fluids, medication
to lower the fever.

03:06.644 --> 03:07.610
That's all we can do.

03:07.645 --> 03:08.711
But a hospital...

03:08.746 --> 03:11.681
The nearest hospital
is nine hours on a bus.

03:11.716 --> 03:14.483
But your father, he's not a doctor.

03:14.519 --> 03:16.552
- He's an herbalist?
- He is a doctor.

03:16.588 --> 03:19.388
He uses Eastern methods.

03:19.424 --> 03:20.523
I'm a doctor too.

03:20.558 --> 03:21.524
You can trust him.

03:24.529 --> 03:25.528
How serious is it?

03:27.832 --> 03:29.398
You can tell me the truth.

03:31.469 --> 03:33.369
One in four do not recover.

03:44.882 --> 03:46.716
Please, Bay.

03:48.686 --> 03:51.587
Please get better.
Please don't leave me.

04:05.570 --> 04:06.769
(sighs)

04:14.445 --> 04:15.778
You're here.

04:15.813 --> 04:18.748
You're here with me and you're okay.

04:24.195 --> 04:25.621
I won't.

04:27.825 --> 04:29.659
I won't. I promise.

I'm getting used to everyone
treating me like a movie star.

04:57.588 --> 04:58.788
Daphne! Bay!

04:58.823 --> 05:01.524
- Dr. Yao! Ling! Hi!
- Hey! Hi!

05:01.559 --> 05:02.591
You look good!

05:02.627 --> 05:03.626
Good health!

05:03.661 --> 05:05.761
Yeah, I am good, and... and thank you.

05:05.797 --> 05:08.664
Thank you so much. <i>Xie
xie</i>. A million times over.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.566
We could never repay you.

05:10.601 --> 05:11.600
You both got me through

05:11.636 --> 05:13.703
the worst night of my entire life.

05:13.738 --> 05:15.738
(speaking Mandarin)

05:15.773 --> 05:16.772
Oh.

05:16.808 --> 05:18.541
- Oh!
- (laughs)

05:19.610 --> 05:20.710
So you go home tomorrow.

05:20.745 --> 05:23.713
Yes. Our flight is in two days.

05:23.748 --> 05:25.614
We're so sad to leave.

05:25.650 --> 05:26.649
There's so much more of this country

05:26.684 --> 05:29.652
we wanted to see, but
we have to get back.

05:29.687 --> 05:32.655
Well, if you ever come back to Beijing,

05:32.690 --> 05:34.623
please, look me up.

05:34.659 --> 05:35.791
You can even help out at my clinic.

05:35.827 --> 05:37.660
Oh, I would love that. Thank you.

05:37.695 --> 05:38.761
- Okay.
- We promise.

05:39.831 --> 05:40.796
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

05:40.832 --> 05:42.565
- (speaking Mandarin)
- Bye.

05:43.768 --> 05:45.601
(both speaking Mandarin)

05:49.807 --> 05:53.776
You said that we have to get back home.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.678
Yeah.

05:55.713 --> 05:57.713
But do we?

05:57.829 --> 05:59.829
I have school in, like, a week.

05:59.864 --> 06:01.797
School will still be there.

06:01.833 --> 06:06.635
Daphne, this is our
chance to shake things up!

06:07.705 --> 06:09.805
I was stuck in that hut for weeks,

06:09.841 --> 06:12.842
and I kept telling
myself that when I got up,

06:12.877 --> 06:15.678
I would make every day count.

06:16.881 --> 06:18.614
So, let's stay.

06:19.717 --> 06:20.749
Let's do a year here!

06:20.785 --> 06:21.784
A year?

06:21.819 --> 06:23.719
Well, Ling just said

06:23.754 --> 06:25.654
that you could help out in her clinic.

06:25.690 --> 06:26.755
What about you?

06:26.791 --> 06:27.857
I'll find something.

06:27.892 --> 06:29.758
I mean, look around.

06:37.835 --> 06:41.637
Do you really want to leave
and go back to Kansas City?

06:41.672 --> 06:42.805
Bay, I can't.

06:42.840 --> 06:44.840
But that's the thing.

06:44.876 --> 06:47.676
We can.

06:49.881 --> 06:51.680
(buzzing)

06:51.716 --> 06:52.815
(grunts)

06:52.850 --> 06:54.717
- (grunts)
- (Bay laughs)

06:54.752 --> 06:55.784
(grunts)

06:55.820 --> 06:58.654
You know how you almost
went to prison for me?

06:58.689 --> 06:59.755
Uh, pretty sure I remember that.

06:59.790 --> 07:01.624
- Yes.
- Yeah? Now we're even.

07:01.659 --> 07:02.725
- (chuckles)
- (sighs)

07:02.760 --> 07:03.726
Oh.

07:05.663 --> 07:08.631
Oh, the lines are so cool!

07:11.802 --> 07:13.802
J and K are going to flip.

07:13.838 --> 07:17.673
About us staying or, uh, this?

07:17.708 --> 07:18.707
Both.

07:18.743 --> 07:20.809
Excuse me, could you
take a picture of us?

07:28.719 --> 07:29.752
(shutter clicks)

07:33.858 --> 07:34.823
(shutter clicks)

07:36.794 --> 07:38.727
Daphne: You look really nervous.

07:38.763 --> 07:39.762
I am.

07:39.797 --> 07:42.665
- It's only for a week.
- I know.

07:42.700 --> 07:45.701
Well, it's not like he's some stranger.

07:45.736 --> 07:48.571
It's him. You guys are you.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.608
I had a lot of time to think
while I was recovering...

07:52.643 --> 07:55.444
Which is why you wanted him to come.

07:55.479 --> 07:58.514
But we left things so weird
the last time I saw him.

07:58.549 --> 08:02.384
I don't know if his feelings
about me are different now.

08:02.420 --> 08:04.853
Well, after everything
that's happened between us,

08:04.889 --> 08:07.489
I just... Oh, when is he gonna get here?

08:07.525 --> 08:08.624
- (sighs)
- (scoffs)

08:08.659 --> 08:12.428
We're in a small village in
the mountains of rural China.

08:12.463 --> 08:14.463
He had to take, like, five forms

08:14.498 --> 08:15.831
of transportation to get here!

08:15.866 --> 08:16.832
Relax.

08:18.736 --> 08:19.668
(sighs)

08:28.779 --> 08:29.778
He's here.

08:43.578 --> 08:44.532
Now there's a good chance

08:44.641 --> 08:47.958
we're going all the way, and I'm
talking the College World Series.

08:48.210 --> 08:50.276
That has never happened for this school.

08:50.312 --> 08:52.545
All we need is a little more cash

08:52.581 --> 08:54.147
to improve our training facilities,

08:54.182 --> 08:56.116
and we'll bring home that trophy.

08:56.151 --> 08:57.550
Plus...

08:57.586 --> 09:00.086
did I mention...

09:00.122 --> 09:02.422
how incredibly hot you look today?

09:04.092 --> 09:06.359
- You did.
- Well, you do.

09:06.395 --> 09:08.328
(chuckles)

09:08.363 --> 09:09.429
I will take your request

09:09.464 --> 09:11.431
under advisement, Coach Kennish.

09:11.466 --> 09:14.401
And if you don't mind, I
have a department head meeting

09:14.436 --> 09:18.405
to attend with the Dean, the
Chancellor, and the Provost.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.440
Look at you!

09:20.475 --> 09:23.376
- This guy bugging you?
- Hey, it's the head of the department.

09:23.502 --> 09:25.502
- I can handle him.
- Oh, I know you can.

09:25.537 --> 09:27.437
That's why I stole you from
the Disabilities Office.

09:27.472 --> 09:29.339
- How you doin', Mike?
- Oh, good. Good.

09:29.374 --> 09:31.374
I need this lady for my
monthly department head meeting.

09:31.409 --> 09:33.376
Kinda hard to focus though
'cause Kathryn tweets at me

09:33.411 --> 09:35.278
the whole time trying to distract me.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.379
I do not.

09:36.414 --> 09:39.182
- Risqué Snapchats too day in, day out.
- (gasps)

09:39.217 --> 09:41.151
- It's a problem.
- Oh, my God.

09:41.186 --> 09:43.153
Don't worry. Deletes in 10
seconds. He'll never know.

09:43.188 --> 09:44.220
I'm out of here.

09:44.256 --> 09:45.221
Honey, I'll see you at home.

09:45.257 --> 09:46.189
- All right.
- See you.

09:47.225 --> 09:48.191
So...

09:48.226 --> 09:49.526
Okay, last question.

09:49.561 --> 09:51.628
Which company do we want to invest
our fictional $10 million in?

09:51.663 --> 09:53.229
My vote is Greenleaf.

09:53.265 --> 09:55.565
With increased demand
and global food supply,

09:55.600 --> 09:56.633
a super-charged photosynthesis

09:56.668 --> 09:58.601
that boosts crop yield, it's win-win.

09:58.637 --> 10:00.603
Well, while you're getting
awards from the community

10:00.639 --> 10:02.605
for being a good person,
I plan to lead a company

10:02.641 --> 10:04.440
that actually turns a profit.

10:04.476 --> 10:06.442
Knowing you two, this
could go on for 20 minutes.

10:06.478 --> 10:09.412
So, I've got Microbiology at 3:00.

10:10.515 --> 10:11.514
- See you guys in class.
- Okay.

10:11.550 --> 10:13.516
Hey, Luca, can you stick
around for two seconds?

10:13.552 --> 10:15.485
That thing is happening
with my phone again.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.420
- Oh, sure.
- (door opens)

10:17.455 --> 10:19.355
- No problem.
- (door closes)

10:20.392 --> 10:22.358
That thing, huh?

10:22.394 --> 10:24.360
Yeah, that thing.

10:25.463 --> 10:27.297
Looks fine to me.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.200
I guess I was wrong.

10:36.274 --> 10:37.207
Mmm.

11:56.554 --> 11:57.587
(sighs)

12:05.330 --> 12:08.264
So how does your day look?

12:13.335 --> 12:17.340
Well, you go teach those
Cobras to play ball.

12:31.623 --> 12:35.558
(speaking Mandarin)

12:35.593 --> 12:37.226
Can you say in English?

12:37.262 --> 12:38.528
I try to learn.

12:38.563 --> 12:39.595
(chuckles) Yeah.

12:39.631 --> 12:42.532
Uh, this chick was a badass warrior.

12:42.567 --> 12:43.633
(phone vibrates)

12:43.668 --> 12:45.435
(speaking Mandarin)

12:45.470 --> 12:46.436
(speaking Mandarin)

12:50.475 --> 12:52.308
Hey, can we talk later?

12:52.344 --> 12:54.410
I'm permanently altering
someone's flesh here.

13:03.288 --> 13:06.155
Um, this is <i> Dit Da Jow.</i>

13:06.191 --> 13:07.156
Man: <i>Dit Da Jow.</i>

13:07.192 --> 13:08.324
Daphne: Massage it into the wound

13:08.360 --> 13:11.627
three times a day when
you change the dressing.

13:11.663 --> 13:13.196
- Bye.
- Bye.

13:16.201 --> 13:17.166
Hey.

13:17.202 --> 13:18.234
Are you okay?

13:18.269 --> 13:20.503
No. We gotta go home.

13:25.718 --> 13:26.750
So he O.D.'d?

13:26.785 --> 13:28.685
He took a bunch of drugs.

13:28.721 --> 13:31.755
Pain pills, sleeping
pills, meds for anxiety.

13:31.790 --> 13:33.590
And he was at a bar alone?

13:33.626 --> 13:34.591
Yeah. He passed out.

13:34.627 --> 13:36.593
Thank God someone called the paramedics.

13:36.629 --> 13:37.661
But was it on purpose,

13:37.696 --> 13:38.762
like he was trying to...

13:38.797 --> 13:42.533
Honey, I think there are a
lot of questions right now.

13:54.647 --> 13:55.579
Hi.

14:04.196 --> 14:05.095
As soon as we heard.

14:21.147 --> 14:23.080
- Hey.
- Yeah, it's good to see you.

14:23.115 --> 14:24.348
We're happy you're okay.

14:48.207 --> 14:50.207
Emmett, that's incredibly dangerous.

14:52.645 --> 14:54.344
Are you taking other drugs out there?

15:23.649 --> 15:27.417
Bay: Emmett, we care about you.

15:27.453 --> 15:29.553
And we don't mind coming home.

15:31.490 --> 15:35.526
We're frustrated because you're
not taking this seriously.

15:35.561 --> 15:36.527
Okay? You could've died!

15:52.411 --> 15:54.244
What was that?

15:54.280 --> 15:55.279
I don't know.

16:00.619 --> 16:03.253
No, there's something
else going on with him.

16:12.698 --> 16:14.531
Well, he's here.

16:14.567 --> 16:16.633
If he has a problem,
he'll work through it.

16:18.604 --> 16:21.505
Yeah. You're right.

16:21.540 --> 16:22.539
Come on.

16:25.578 --> 16:27.411
John: They're a block away.

16:27.446 --> 16:28.478
Oh, that's great!

16:28.514 --> 16:30.414
Hey, listen, do you
think we can actually get

16:30.449 --> 16:32.349
our hands on that money for my guys?

16:32.384 --> 16:33.383
I got my finger ready

16:33.419 --> 16:35.385
to press "send" on some
brand new gym equipment.

16:35.421 --> 16:37.321
I didn't want to get into this tonight,

16:37.356 --> 16:39.289
but I had to go another
way with those funds.

16:39.325 --> 16:40.357
Wait, what?

16:40.392 --> 16:42.359
I gave the money to
the Women's Swim Team.

16:42.394 --> 16:44.228
The Women's Swim Team?

16:44.263 --> 16:45.229
Kathryn, my team...

16:45.264 --> 16:47.297
Is one of 15 that I am responsible for.

16:47.413 --> 16:49.780
I can't go playing favorites
just because you're my husband.

16:49.815 --> 16:51.415
- (door opens)
- Regina: Hey!

16:51.450 --> 16:53.350
They're here!

16:53.385 --> 16:54.351
Oh!

16:54.386 --> 16:56.353
- (laughter)
- Hey, guys!

16:56.388 --> 16:57.754
- Oh, hi, sweetie!
- Mom, hi!

16:57.790 --> 16:59.723
- Hi!
- Oh, look at you guys!

16:59.758 --> 17:01.658
You look so much older!

17:01.694 --> 17:02.693
- Hi!
- Don't they?

17:02.728 --> 17:04.627
- Yeah.
- (laughter)

17:05.731 --> 17:09.598
Oh, I am just hoping that that's fake.

17:09.635 --> 17:13.569
Aw, you didn't really
think that I was working

17:13.605 --> 17:16.573
at a tattoo parlor without
getting some ink myself?

17:16.608 --> 17:17.641
I was hoping.

17:17.675 --> 17:19.643
They both got one. Matching.

17:19.678 --> 17:21.578
- Oh...
- Yeah!

17:21.613 --> 17:23.512
They're actually two halves of a whole.

17:23.549 --> 17:25.382
The characters are different,

17:25.416 --> 17:28.417
but when you put them
together, they mean "fate".

17:28.454 --> 17:30.454
- Oh.
- It's beautiful, honey.

17:30.489 --> 17:31.521
Let me see!

17:31.557 --> 17:34.291
Oh, my gosh, your lasagna!

17:34.326 --> 17:35.392
- I'm so excited!
- Ah!

17:35.427 --> 17:36.460
- Ah!
- Oh!

17:36.495 --> 17:37.761
Our girls are home!

17:37.796 --> 17:39.429
- Whoo!
- Let's eat!

17:39.465 --> 17:40.430
John: All right.

17:41.870 --> 17:45.472
So what are you two gonna
do now that you're home?

17:45.507 --> 17:48.775
Well, I'm gonna take a
couple of pre-med classes

17:48.811 --> 17:51.711
and move back to campus so
I can be close to the library

17:51.747 --> 17:53.713
and study groups and all that.

17:53.749 --> 17:55.715
Wow, diving back in.
You gotta love that.

17:55.751 --> 17:58.752
And she is going to write a
letter to the department head

17:58.787 --> 18:00.654
to get credit for all of the work

18:00.689 --> 18:01.788
that she was doing out at the clinic.

18:01.824 --> 18:04.558
- That's great!
- And once they approve it,

18:04.593 --> 18:05.759
I'll be getting three
credits, which is awesome.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.627
So Bay, what are you gonna do?

18:07.663 --> 18:08.628
Same thing as Beijing.

18:08.664 --> 18:10.564
I'm gonna get a job at a tattoo parlor.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.567
I can see you biting your
tongue and I appreciate that.

18:13.602 --> 18:15.569
Honey, we support you
as long as it's legal

18:15.604 --> 18:16.703
and you're passionate about it.

18:16.738 --> 18:19.506
That's good, um...

18:19.541 --> 18:23.577
because my other plan is
to find a place to live...

18:25.481 --> 18:26.446
with Travis.

18:27.549 --> 18:29.416
- Excuse me?
- Hm?

18:29.451 --> 18:30.550
John, where did you think

18:30.586 --> 18:33.353
Travis was sleeping
these past eight months?

18:33.388 --> 18:35.555
I never thought about
it and I don't intend to.

18:35.591 --> 18:37.491
But now that she's
home, she won't be living

18:37.526 --> 18:39.392
with someone that she's not married to.

18:39.428 --> 18:40.861
You do know it's 2016, right?

18:40.896 --> 18:42.762
Bay: Yeah, and here's another number.

18:42.798 --> 18:44.698
20. As in, I am.

18:44.733 --> 18:47.701
But you might need an
adult to co-sign a lease,

18:47.736 --> 18:50.704
so I think you might need another plan.

18:50.739 --> 18:52.672
Hello, Regina.

18:53.842 --> 18:56.610
Oh. Um... (chuckles)

18:56.645 --> 18:57.744
Don't pull me into this one.

18:57.779 --> 19:00.580
Wait, what about the apartment
above The Cracked Mug?

19:00.616 --> 19:02.716
- Isn't that empty?
- Well, yeah, but...

19:02.751 --> 19:04.584
Bay: I totally forgot about that!

19:04.620 --> 19:05.552
Can we have it?

19:08.557 --> 19:10.490
U... um...

19:10.526 --> 19:12.659
I'm not gonna do anything to
go against your parents' wishes.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.528
- Thank you, Regina.
- Since when?

19:15.597 --> 19:17.430
Actually, I'm fine with it,

19:17.466 --> 19:19.499
so that makes two parents against one.

19:19.535 --> 19:20.567
- Kathryn!
- What?

19:20.602 --> 19:22.569
You and I spent time together

19:22.604 --> 19:24.504
when you were on the road
when we were their age,

19:24.540 --> 19:26.439
and Toby is living in England

19:26.475 --> 19:28.375
with his girlfriend and baby, so...

19:28.410 --> 19:29.376
That's different.

19:29.411 --> 19:30.343
All: How?

19:31.380 --> 19:34.381
Oh, Moms, you guys are the best. Mm!

19:36.385 --> 19:37.684
Garlic bread, anyone?

19:39.421 --> 19:40.420
(sighs)

19:40.455 --> 19:42.822
Oh, look at us, a couple
of college students

19:42.858 --> 19:44.424
hanging out on campus!

19:44.459 --> 19:46.660
(sighs) Is it weird having me here?

19:46.695 --> 19:47.827
Are you kidding? It's awesome!

19:47.863 --> 19:49.729
- I'm so proud of you.
- Hm.

19:49.765 --> 19:51.831
Well, I just was so
sick of always having to

19:51.867 --> 19:56.603
ask John or Wes or Eric to
make sense of the books for me.

19:56.638 --> 19:58.805
I realized I needed to
figure it out myself.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.741
Well, especially if you're gonna
be a big coffee house mogul.

20:01.777 --> 20:02.742
- (laughs)
- Luca: Regina!

20:04.646 --> 20:05.712
Luca!

20:05.747 --> 20:07.747
Luca, this is my daughter, Daphne.

20:07.783 --> 20:10.550
Daphne, this is Luca.

20:10.586 --> 20:12.719
We have an entrepreneurship
seminar together.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.487
Mm.

20:14.523 --> 20:17.624
Uh, the inventor of Baja Tempeh Tacos!

20:17.659 --> 20:19.492
I hope you don't mind

20:19.528 --> 20:21.461
I... I stole a copy
from your recipe book.

20:22.764 --> 20:25.498
I've had a couple of study
sessions at the guest house,

20:25.534 --> 20:28.501
you know, since my
place was the biggest.

20:29.571 --> 20:32.405
- Uh, you're a cook?
- I try.

20:32.441 --> 20:33.573
He's an amazing cook.

20:33.609 --> 20:35.809
And he was a medic in the army

20:35.844 --> 20:37.477
in Afghanistan for three years.

20:37.512 --> 20:38.812
A medic? No kidding.

20:38.847 --> 20:41.748
I'm pre-med and a Radar Radar fan.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.883
Wait, what? You know these guys?

20:43.919 --> 20:45.852
That is random!

20:45.887 --> 20:48.788
I... I mean most people have
no idea this is actually a band.

20:48.824 --> 20:50.824
Daphne: Yeah, electronic's good for me.

20:50.859 --> 20:52.826
Loud beats, heavy bass.

20:52.861 --> 20:54.861
Well, I got a bootleg
of their Coachella set

20:54.896 --> 20:56.630
I can let you borrow.

20:56.665 --> 20:58.565
Yes. Awesome. (laughs)

20:59.701 --> 21:01.668
Looks like you two have a lot in common.

21:02.838 --> 21:04.704
Well, I gotta get to my Com class.

21:04.740 --> 21:07.540
Um... see you around?

21:07.576 --> 21:08.508
Definitely.

21:12.514 --> 21:13.580
He seems cool.

21:13.615 --> 21:15.482
He's okay.

21:15.517 --> 21:18.451
So, I mean, speaking of boys,
what's up with you and Mingo?

21:18.487 --> 21:20.420
Oh, I have no idea.

21:20.455 --> 21:22.656
Uh, we texted a few times in China,

21:22.691 --> 21:25.558
and it was flirty, but it's Mingo, so...

21:25.594 --> 21:27.594
- Mm.
- Actually, I'm headed there now.

21:27.629 --> 21:29.596
I'm trying to get a room in my old dorm

21:29.631 --> 21:32.532
and he's the R.A. this year,
so he has to sign off on it.

21:32.567 --> 21:35.209
Well, uh, here's hoping
that ex-girlfriends

21:35.210 --> 21:37.410
can cash in on a bit of nepotism.

21:37.472 --> 21:38.438
(both laugh)

21:38.473 --> 21:39.839
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

21:45.547 --> 21:46.446
Huh?

21:47.482 --> 21:49.749
It, uh, needs a little work,

21:49.785 --> 21:52.819
but we'll just clear out the dust

21:52.854 --> 21:54.688
and evict the spiders.

21:56.825 --> 21:57.857
And free.

22:08.804 --> 22:12.539
Oh, yeah, and we could, uh,
hang up some Chinese lanterns.

22:19.548 --> 22:22.549
You might be able to persuade me.

22:24.686 --> 22:25.618
(phone chimes)

22:27.556 --> 22:29.389
- (phone chimes)
- (phone vibrates)

22:38.851 --> 22:40.751
Knock, knock.

22:40.786 --> 22:42.119
Red!

22:42.154 --> 22:43.187
You're back!

22:43.222 --> 22:44.788
Hey.

22:44.824 --> 22:46.156
<i>♪ Anytime you call ♪</i>

22:46.192 --> 22:47.191
<i>♪ Anything you need ♪</i>

22:47.226 --> 22:49.159
- (chuckles) <i>
- ♪ You know you can always ♪</i>

22:49.195 --> 22:50.194
- <i>♪ Count on me ♪</i>
- So...

22:50.229 --> 22:53.130
rumor has it that you are the new R.A.

22:53.165 --> 22:54.098
It's true!

22:54.133 --> 22:56.066
I tricked those suckers

22:56.102 --> 22:58.001
over in the Housing
Department into thinking that

22:58.037 --> 23:00.170
I was actually a responsible adult.

23:01.974 --> 23:03.941
(sputters, chuckles)

23:03.976 --> 23:06.110
Looks like you're taking
it pretty seriously.

23:06.145 --> 23:07.911
Yeah, um...

23:07.947 --> 23:10.881
Look, don't tell anybody, but
I actually kind of love it.

23:11.951 --> 23:13.083
Oh, hey! We're having a party tonight.

23:13.119 --> 23:14.084
You gotta come.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.820
It's a costume karaoke party.

23:16.856 --> 23:18.055
Come dressed as your favorite singer.

23:18.090 --> 23:19.990
The best costume wins a prize,

23:20.025 --> 23:22.893
but I'm taking home the gold.

23:22.928 --> 23:24.795
Who are you going as?

23:24.830 --> 23:26.830
Oh, yeah, and just ruin the big reveal?

23:26.866 --> 23:27.831
- Not a chance.
- (chuckles)

23:27.867 --> 23:29.800
But trust me, you don't wanna miss it.

23:29.835 --> 23:30.834
I'll think about it.

23:32.938 --> 23:34.905
It is really good to see you again.

23:34.940 --> 23:36.773
Yeah!

23:36.809 --> 23:37.841
Yeah.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.813
Um, this is weird,

23:42.848 --> 23:44.748
um, but I feel like
I... I gotta tell you.

23:45.851 --> 23:47.784
I'm kind of seeing someone.

23:49.121 --> 23:51.088
It's my ex-girlfriend.

23:51.123 --> 23:53.123
We're... we're kind of, like...

23:53.159 --> 23:55.125
Yeah, no. O... of course.

23:56.162 --> 23:58.028
I think Iris mentioned it.

23:58.063 --> 24:01.932
But I actually came with
a dorm-related question.

24:03.068 --> 24:04.902
Do you have any space available?

24:04.937 --> 24:06.870
I was hoping to move in,

24:06.906 --> 24:08.906
get back in the college groove...

24:08.941 --> 24:10.941
Yeah, I... I wish I could help you,

24:10.976 --> 24:13.043
but there are just no girl spots open.

24:15.915 --> 24:18.749
Looks like I missed out
on a lot while I was gone.

24:26.025 --> 24:27.758
Have you tried "Find My Phone"?

24:27.793 --> 24:30.194
My parents have used it a
few times to hunt me down.

24:51.150 --> 24:52.082
(sighs)

24:59.024 --> 25:00.057
Of course.

25:00.092 --> 25:03.060
Melody, we will find him, okay?

25:03.095 --> 25:04.061
Don't worry.

25:10.002 --> 25:11.001
(door opens)

25:11.036 --> 25:12.836
(door closes)

25:14.974 --> 25:17.808
- Yeah, I don't know...
- Hey, guys!

25:17.843 --> 25:18.976
Oh, my God! Daphne!

25:19.011 --> 25:20.811
- My ex-roommate!
- (laughs)

25:20.846 --> 25:22.813
Welcome back!

25:22.848 --> 25:24.848
The photos you posted were amazing!

25:24.883 --> 25:26.750
China was pretty amazing.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.754
You're so lucky to have
missed Molecular Bio.

25:30.789 --> 25:32.189
Seriously twice as hard as Marillo.

25:32.224 --> 25:34.758
- I... I'm so psyched to be done.
- (sighs)

25:34.793 --> 25:35.826
I bet.

25:35.861 --> 25:38.128
I'm actually on my way to the Registrar

25:38.163 --> 25:40.063
to sign up for some pre-med classes.

25:40.099 --> 25:42.132
The pre-meds are closed.
Totally maxed out.

25:43.202 --> 25:45.035
Right. Of course.

25:45.070 --> 25:47.204
Um, I'm sure I'll find something.

25:47.239 --> 25:49.072
Uh, we better...

25:49.108 --> 25:51.074
Right. Let's make a plan.

25:51.110 --> 25:52.109
The three of us. Okay?

25:53.178 --> 25:55.012
For sure. Yeah.

25:55.047 --> 25:57.014
Bye! Welcome home!

25:57.049 --> 25:57.981
Bye.

26:04.023 --> 26:05.055
(beep)

26:05.090 --> 26:06.923
(phone vibrates)

26:08.027 --> 26:09.893
- Hello?
- Bay: <i> Hi.</i>

26:09.928 --> 26:13.897
Uh... it's Bay actually
on Emmett's phone.

26:13.932 --> 26:15.766
What do you want?

26:15.801 --> 26:17.734
I totally deserve that.

26:17.770 --> 26:18.769
(sighs)

26:18.804 --> 26:20.871
Look, I just wanted to make sure that...

26:20.906 --> 26:22.773
you knew what was going on with Emmett.

26:22.808 --> 26:23.874
I... I don't know if anyone called you.

26:23.909 --> 26:25.776
Why would anyone call me?

26:25.811 --> 26:26.810
He O.D.'d.

26:26.845 --> 26:28.745
- Oh, my God. <i>
- He's okay.</i>

26:28.781 --> 26:31.782
He said it was a mistake, but...

26:31.817 --> 26:33.183
(sighs) he was at the hospital

26:33.218 --> 26:35.819
<i>and he, like, escaped or something,</i>

26:35.854 --> 26:38.188
and we thought that he might
be on his way back to L.A.

26:38.223 --> 26:41.024
He had mentioned that
he has a bunch of, like,

26:41.060 --> 26:42.726
film festivals and meetings coming up.

26:42.761 --> 26:45.062
I'm really sorry to hear
that, but you know Emmett

26:45.097 --> 26:47.064
and I broke up two months ago, right?

26:47.099 --> 26:49.132
No, I... I didn't.

26:49.168 --> 26:51.134
And I know for a fact
that he was rejected

26:51.170 --> 26:53.170
from all the big festivals because...

26:53.205 --> 26:55.172
<i>he was pretty upset about it.</i>

26:55.240 --> 26:57.040
He was always talking

26:57.076 --> 26:59.109
about how things were so
much better in high school

26:59.144 --> 27:02.979
<i>and how life will never be
as good as it was back then.</i>

27:03.015 --> 27:04.981
He never wanted to do anything.

27:05.017 --> 27:05.982
I'd find him in his room

27:06.018 --> 27:07.017
in the middle of the day sleeping.

27:07.052 --> 27:09.853
Skye, you don't think that he...

27:09.888 --> 27:11.922
I mean, has he ever talked
about hurting himself?

27:11.957 --> 27:13.890
Not directly, but...

27:13.926 --> 27:14.925
I don't know if he would have told me

27:14.960 --> 27:16.793
even if he did feel that way.

27:16.829 --> 27:17.928
(door opens, closes)

27:17.963 --> 27:19.796
Who are you talking to?

27:19.832 --> 27:21.832
Um, thanks so much, Skye.

27:22.935 --> 27:24.901
- Will you keep me posted?
- Yeah.

27:26.805 --> 27:27.771
Skye?

27:27.806 --> 27:30.173
I think I know where he might be.

27:32.335 --> 27:34.235
You completely undermined me, John.

27:34.270 --> 27:35.670
Come on, Kathryn. You're
making a much bigger deal

27:35.705 --> 27:37.605
out of this than it actually was.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.240
I ran into Mike in the hallway.

27:39.275 --> 27:41.575
It just naturally came
up in conversation,

27:41.611 --> 27:43.678
and I thought, "What
have I got to lose? Ask."

27:45.248 --> 27:46.480
(imitating Mike) "Kathryn...

27:46.516 --> 27:48.449
I thought you would have told John

27:48.484 --> 27:49.483
that the money went to swimming."

27:49.519 --> 27:50.618
(as herself) "Oh, I did, Mike. I did,

27:50.653 --> 27:53.421
"but apparently my husband
decided to circumvent me

27:53.456 --> 27:54.588
and go directly to you
to get what he wanted."

27:54.624 --> 27:56.390
You know what? You are overreacting.

27:56.426 --> 27:58.426
Your actions have
consequences for me, John.

27:58.461 --> 28:00.361
Going over my head made me look weak.

28:00.396 --> 28:01.395
How can you not see that?

28:01.431 --> 28:02.463
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

28:02.498 --> 28:04.298
I didn't think it through.

28:04.334 --> 28:06.500
Do you know how much harder
it is for me in this job?

28:06.536 --> 28:09.403
I am the only woman in
every one of my meetings.

28:09.439 --> 28:11.405
I stand like this before lunch

28:11.441 --> 28:13.407
'cause I read that it
boosts your testosterone

28:13.443 --> 28:16.243
and helps you speak more confidently.

28:16.279 --> 28:17.244
(sighs)

28:17.280 --> 28:19.280
I have no idea why
they gave me this job.

28:19.315 --> 28:23.184
They gave you the job
because you are incredible

28:23.219 --> 28:25.252
at getting people to do what you want...

28:25.288 --> 28:28.255
including writing very large checks.

28:29.592 --> 28:32.226
I'm feeling in over my head, John,

28:32.261 --> 28:33.561
and I need your support.

28:34.630 --> 28:35.596
- All right?
- Yeah.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.631
I supported you for decades.

28:37.667 --> 28:41.469
I know, so I will not
be a problem anymore.

28:42.605 --> 28:44.472
Okay. Can you unpack all this?

28:44.507 --> 28:45.539
I have about 50 things I have to do.

28:49.612 --> 28:52.413
I'm off to cram for a Physics exam.

28:52.448 --> 28:53.447
Good luck.

28:53.483 --> 28:55.516
- Yeah. See ya.
- Regina: Bye.

28:55.551 --> 28:59.353
Hey, Luca, about that Photoshop thing?

28:59.389 --> 29:01.489
- (door opens, closes)
- Yeah, sure.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.359
There's only so many times
you can ask me to stay

29:05.395 --> 29:07.461
before Vimla figures out
that you really should just

29:07.497 --> 29:09.296
get a subscription to Tech Support.

29:09.332 --> 29:11.365
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

29:13.403 --> 29:17.238
You're breaking up with me.

29:17.273 --> 29:21.208
Well, we can't break up
because we were never together.

29:23.212 --> 29:24.211
Okay.

29:24.247 --> 29:26.614
Look, my daughters are back.

29:26.649 --> 29:28.249
I knew it.

29:28.284 --> 29:30.217
I... I run into Daphne on campus,

29:30.253 --> 29:31.619
we get along, and you freak out.

29:31.654 --> 29:32.653
I'm not freaking out.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.622
I saw the way you were looking at us,

29:34.657 --> 29:37.224
like... like he's closer
to her age than mine.

29:37.260 --> 29:38.592
Which is true.

29:38.628 --> 29:39.660
And irrelevant.

29:39.765 --> 29:41.632
I don't want to lie to them.

29:41.667 --> 29:43.667
I've done it before and
it's caused a lot of damage.

29:43.703 --> 29:44.735
So tell them.

29:44.770 --> 29:46.604
I don't care.

29:46.639 --> 29:48.639
My last relationship ended horribly

29:48.674 --> 29:50.574
and I... I wanted something simple.

29:50.610 --> 29:53.611
You and I have a connection
and you know that.

29:55.515 --> 29:57.481
Please don't make this
harder than it has to be.

29:58.651 --> 30:00.417
Fine.

30:02.488 --> 30:03.587
Okay.

30:03.623 --> 30:05.389
Thanks.

30:05.424 --> 30:07.491
- I'll see you in class.
- Yeah. Sure.

30:11.531 --> 30:13.531
(door opens, closes)

30:23.376 --> 30:24.341
What are you doing?

30:24.377 --> 30:26.744
Do you know how worried
everyone is about you?

30:26.779 --> 30:28.379
Did you take anything?

30:49.765 --> 30:51.602
Nobody hates you.

30:51.637 --> 30:52.703
We love you.

30:54.540 --> 30:55.673
You just lost yourself out there,

30:55.708 --> 30:58.475
but we're here to help you get back.

31:06.652 --> 31:07.618
It's all right.

31:22.401 --> 31:25.302
Hey, it's okay.

31:25.338 --> 31:26.470
It's all right.

31:42.788 --> 31:45.356
I'm gonna go call Melody.

31:55.768 --> 31:56.700
I know.

32:00.640 --> 32:01.639
It was good.

32:08.481 --> 32:09.513
Emmett...

32:16.555 --> 32:17.588
You said you were fine with it.

32:19.458 --> 32:22.326
You broke up with me.

32:23.496 --> 32:26.430
I didn't get out of bed for weeks.

32:26.465 --> 32:28.465
I wanted to die of sadness.

32:34.407 --> 32:36.373
Emmett, don't...

32:43.061 --> 32:45.515
I cannot believe he said that.

32:45.596 --> 32:47.796
Do you know how badly

32:47.900 --> 32:49.266
I wanted to hear that for months?

32:49.301 --> 32:50.800
Oh, I remember.

32:50.836 --> 32:52.202
And... and now I'm with
Travis, and you know what?

32:52.237 --> 32:53.770
I'm happy!

32:53.805 --> 32:55.138
You should be. He's the best.

32:55.174 --> 32:56.139
He is.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.075
(sighs)

32:59.111 --> 33:00.110
(sighs)

33:00.145 --> 33:02.746
But when he said that,

33:02.781 --> 33:06.149
my heart, it leapt a little bit.

33:07.219 --> 33:08.185
Is that terrible?

33:08.220 --> 33:10.187
Of course not.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.022
(phone vibrates)

33:16.995 --> 33:17.961
What now?

33:20.999 --> 33:22.866

33:22.901 --> 33:23.867
it doesn't count.

33:23.902 --> 33:24.935
I'm not getting credit!

33:24.970 --> 33:25.936
What?

33:25.971 --> 33:27.971
My entire year was a waste.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.039
A complete waste!

33:29.074 --> 33:30.941
Daphne, just... just
wait a minute, okay?

33:30.976 --> 33:32.842
I am a year behind.

33:32.878 --> 33:34.911
Everyone on my track is ahead of me.

33:34.980 --> 33:37.781
Mingo has moved on and I can't find

33:37.816 --> 33:38.982
a place to live on campus!

33:39.017 --> 33:40.817
Daphne, you have got to calm down.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.919
- Okay?
- I'm not blaming you.

33:42.919 --> 33:44.218
I said yes, but...

33:45.922 --> 33:47.855
I should have realized
what this would do.

33:47.890 --> 33:52.126
What it did was give us
an amazing year together.

33:53.196 --> 33:55.729
And of course, the first
couple of weeks back,

33:55.765 --> 33:57.765
we are gonna feel off,

33:57.800 --> 34:02.036
and I'm sure that we missed a
really awesome Sigma Nu party

34:02.071 --> 34:05.139
or, like, a really exciting
football game, but...

34:07.076 --> 34:08.708
how many people can say

34:08.744 --> 34:11.045
that they have seen
the Terracotta Warriors

34:11.080 --> 34:13.047
or floated down the Li River?

34:15.016 --> 34:16.083
What about the night

34:16.118 --> 34:18.953
that we got our tattoos
at the Lotus Festival?

34:18.987 --> 34:23.023
Would you really trade
any of those nights

34:23.059 --> 34:25.059
just so you could be on track?

34:27.996 --> 34:29.830
I'm gonna miss living with you.

34:39.809 --> 34:40.940
Why don't you move in here?

34:42.945 --> 34:46.746
Thanks, but there's not
enough room for three of us.

34:46.782 --> 34:49.783
Daphne, you can't find housing.

34:49.819 --> 34:52.753
I'm not gonna move into
our mom's free apartment

34:52.788 --> 34:56.690
with my boyfriend if you
don't have a place to live.

34:57.827 --> 34:59.093
You're sure he won't mind?

34:59.128 --> 35:00.761
He'll understand.

35:00.796 --> 35:04.765
Can't come between two sisters, right?

35:04.800 --> 35:06.767
Then yeah.

35:06.802 --> 35:08.135
I'd love to.

35:09.739 --> 35:11.038

40:04.833 --> 40:05.832
That's a "yes".

40:29.825 --> 40:31.792
Not cool.

What's the matter? You
