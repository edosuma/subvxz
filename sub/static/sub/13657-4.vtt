This jet lag is killing me.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.916

on the ground.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.892
Too much sodium.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.460
You sure?
'cause I took like 30 bags

If it's not up to
your usual standards,

Maybe we can get the d.A.
To revoke your deal.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.451
Yeah, and then instead of
testifying tomorrow,

00:52.453 --> 00:55.888
You can spend the next 20 years
in a state facility.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.757
No, I'm not complaining, guys.
You've both been awesome.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.526
First time I've ridden
in a police car

You don't make

You don't leave this room,
and you don't open the door.

four weeks back, I fainted.

About all the money

I'm arguing with my ex-wife,

And the next minute,
I wake up in an ambulance

With some guy asking me
who the president is.

Nothing.

High blood pressure.

The doctor wants to put me
on this pill,

02:30.451 --> 02:33.485
But the side effects
could make me irritable, moody,

of first-degree murder.

let this happen?

told to pick the creep up
at the airport,

My chances of a conviction
are zero.

Stealing moving vans
and fencing their contents.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.824
They had a dispute over money.
Scott perry shot dennis tucker.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.327
His other friend, lloyd gibbs,
witnessed the murder

08:15.329 --> 08:17.028
And agreed to testify.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.097
Couldn't you have just made
a deal with mr. Perry?

08:19.099 --> 08:21.166
We believe scott perry
was paid to kill his friend

08:21.168 --> 08:24.302
By someone more powerful,
most likely his fence,

08:24.304 --> 08:26.972
And there's no deal
unless perry gives the guy up.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.342
I, um, I usually hang out
over here.

08:32.845 --> 08:36.715
Kris: No one's ever taken me
to a police station before.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.816
Wow.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.986
It's just all
so interesting.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.121
Oh, buzz,
this is my friend kris.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.723
Kris, this is buzz.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.259
<i>You're</i> kris?
I thought you were...

08:48.728 --> 08:50.695
I mean, it's so nice
to meet you.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.264
You too.

08:52.266 --> 08:54.366
What a cool place to study.
How many people work here?

08:54.368 --> 08:56.334
About half.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.703
Here's
your math problems back.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.739
I marked the ones
you might want to rethink.

09:00.741 --> 09:01.773
Thanks.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.742
You can sit here.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.045
Sharon:
I understand your frustration,

09:07.047 --> 09:08.980
But until we have orders
to the contrary,

09:08.982 --> 09:11.416
L.A.P.D. Officers
are not required

09:11.418 --> 09:13.084
To babysit
your witnesses.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.086
Emma: Unless they're cute,
little blond boys,

09:15.088 --> 09:17.155
In which case,
you adopt them?

09:17.157 --> 09:19.824
Look, I can't put lloyd gibbs
on the stand

09:19.826 --> 09:22.827
Unless he's cleared
of this murder -- immediately.

09:22.829 --> 09:24.963
Lieutenant tao
has just returned

09:24.965 --> 09:28.867
With evidence from
the crime scene at
the convenience store.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.436
I will be out there momentarily
to examine it. Thank you.

09:36.442 --> 09:37.776
Ah, ah.

09:38.778 --> 09:40.979
Sit.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.847
Captain...

09:42.849 --> 09:45.317
We were never informed that
lloyd gibbs could be dangerous,

09:45.319 --> 09:47.252
And he was unarmed
when we picked him up.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.788
And you searched him
for weapons?

09:49.790 --> 09:51.723
The dirtbag
was getting off a plane!

09:51.725 --> 09:53.391
That's the tsa's job!

09:53.393 --> 09:55.393
I'm almost certain
that this whole thing

09:55.395 --> 09:57.228
Is just one big
misunderstanding,

09:57.230 --> 09:59.064
And we'll sort it out
in no time.

09:59.066 --> 10:02.200
Tao:
The evidence shows lloyd gibbs
robbed the convenience store

10:02.202 --> 10:04.002
After shooting the owner
to death.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.004
And what makes you
so sure of that?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.906
The time line
we put together.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.943
Sykes: Louis berg,
owner of easy time market.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.180
At 1:16 a.M. -- Standing
in the middle of his store.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.449
Mr. Berg was shot twice
in the chest.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.050
As you can see,
his blood covers

10:19.052 --> 10:21.152
About a 4-foot radius
on the floor.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.154
Lloyd gibbs' sneakers.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.589
See the tread?

10:25.758 --> 10:29.427
Gibbs walked through the blood
to the counter,

10:29.429 --> 10:33.331
And then he tracked prints
to the door and beyond.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.433
Is there any video
from inside the market?

10:35.435 --> 10:38.937
There were cameras in the store,
but nothing was being recorded.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.338
Aha!

10:40.340 --> 10:42.107
So no incriminating footage
from the scene.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.477
But we did catch some video
from an atm 20 yards away.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.312
I've blown it up.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.981
That's lloyd gibbs
jumping up and down in a puddle.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.985
Trying, I think,
to get blood off his sneakers.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.321
Buzz, can you freeze-frame?

10:56.323 --> 10:57.889
Thanks.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.392
Underneath his right arm --
two six-packs of beer.

11:00.394 --> 11:01.860
Underneath his left arm --

11:01.862 --> 11:04.095
A bag stamped
"easy time market."

11:04.097 --> 11:07.065
Other security cameras captured
his run back to the motel,

11:07.067 --> 11:08.266
Culminating at 3:10 a.M.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.968
With this video of gibbs

11:09.970 --> 11:11.870
Staggering through
the parking lot

11:11.872 --> 11:12.837
Towards his room.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.005
Oh, my god.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.840
Tao:
This footage is consistent

11:15.842 --> 11:18.109
With all the 911 calls
from various people

11:18.111 --> 11:21.946
Reporting someone matching
our suspect's description
returning to the motel.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.015
Emma: I've got 15 minutes
to get to court

11:24.017 --> 11:25.884
And persuade the judge
that lloyd gibbs

11:25.886 --> 11:27.952
Is a credible witness
being unfairly detained.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.155
Anybody care
to come back me up?

11:30.157 --> 11:31.289
I will.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.224
This evidence
is total bullshit.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.592
Emma: Thank you.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.494
Nice to know I have
at least one friend here,

11:36.496 --> 11:38.129
Detective lopez.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.531
[ chuckles ]

11:41.867 --> 11:43.868
Oh, that's so sad.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.371
I know --
the poor shopkeeper's family.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.373
No, I mean that
detective sanchez has a crush

11:48.375 --> 11:49.841
On that horrible emma lady,

11:49.843 --> 11:51.309
And she doesn't
even know his name.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.244
Uh-huh.
Thank you.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.412
That was ballistics.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.114
The .45 found
in lloyd's room

11:56.116 --> 11:58.583
Not only matches the bullets
that killed louis berg --

11:58.585 --> 12:00.452
It's also
the missing murder weapon

12:00.454 --> 12:01.586
From dda rios' trial.

12:03.923 --> 12:05.857
I think
her material witness

12:05.859 --> 12:08.159
May end up becoming
her new defendant.

12:19.972 --> 12:21.272
Emma: Ii'll be opensclose
to charges of misconduct.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.907
Don't worry.
I got your back.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.009
Judge richwood:
Let's call the court to order.

12:25.011 --> 12:27.412
Your honor, one moment
before you bring in the jury.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.281
I have a...
A little emergency.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.351
[ sighs ]
will counsel please approach?

12:34.186 --> 12:36.955
Detective lopez.

12:39.024 --> 12:41.292
All right,
what's the problem, ms. Rios?

12:41.294 --> 12:44.062
Because of threats to the life
of the people's witness,

12:44.064 --> 12:45.930
The l.A.P.D. Has taken
lloyd gibbs

12:45.932 --> 12:47.298
Into protective custody, sir.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.501
He's temporarily unavailable
to testify.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.970
I'm sorry.
You are?

12:51.972 --> 12:55.507
Detective julio sanchez.
Major crimes.

12:55.509 --> 12:58.576
Dda rios insisted that mr. Gibbs
be allowed to appear,

12:58.578 --> 13:00.478
But in our opinion,
it's not safe.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.981
Your honor, I find
this explanation ridiculous.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.283
Your honor, mr. Gibbs
is being held by the police.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.185
And he is being protected.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.653
Dillard:
Your honor, 10 minutes ago,
I heard a news report

13:08.655 --> 13:10.655
That a man
sounding like lloyd gibbs

13:10.657 --> 13:12.056
Was arrested for murder

13:12.058 --> 13:13.491
Tragically similar to the one

13:13.493 --> 13:15.460
My client is on trial for
at this very moment.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.962
Your honor, the l.A.P.D.
Is not run by reporters,

13:17.964 --> 13:20.231
And our concerns about mr. Gibbs
are legitimate.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.600
[ inhales deeply ]
ms. Rios...

13:22.602 --> 13:24.435
Look, I don't mind
an afternoon off

13:24.437 --> 13:25.670
Or a late morning tomorrow,

13:25.672 --> 13:28.606
But the jury can't stay here
indefinitely.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.275
I'll grant
a 24-hour continuance,

13:30.277 --> 13:32.677
At which time
trial will resume

13:32.679 --> 13:34.445
With your witness or without.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.547
Is that clear?

13:35.549 --> 13:37.115
Yes, your honor.
Thank you.

13:39.084 --> 13:42.587
Wow, you completely
misrepresented what's going on.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.222
It's too soon to say.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.125
Maybe lloyd
wasn't even in that store.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.693
Hell yeah,
I was in the store.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.161
But you didn't
rob the place?

13:50.163 --> 13:53.031
Uh, did I <i>rob</i> it?
Um...

13:53.033 --> 13:55.133
Well, why do you even need
to think about it?

13:55.135 --> 13:57.168
Either you robbed the place
or you didn't.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.670
I-it's not a simple
yes-or-no answer.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.506
Okay, the cashier
was lying on the floor, dead.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.575
I mean [laughs]
what was I gonna do --

14:03.577 --> 14:06.277
Throw a 20 on him and say,
"here you go, dead guy"?

14:06.279 --> 14:08.046
"that's for the beer.
Keep the change."

14:08.048 --> 14:10.515
Had you ever seen
the shopkeeper before?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.450
I don't think so.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.186
I mean, does this look like
anyone you know?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.588
Oh, very funny, lloyd.

14:16.590 --> 14:18.990
<i>We're asking you</i>
<i>serious questions here.</i>

14:18.992 --> 14:20.291
<i>Well, and I'm giving you</i>
<i>serious answers.</i>

14:20.293 --> 14:22.026
<i>[ stammers ]</i>
<i>as far as I know,</i>

14:22.028 --> 14:24.395
<i>I'd never seen the guy before,</i>
<i>and even if I had,</i>

14:24.397 --> 14:26.664
<i>I definitely</i>
<i>would not have recognized him</i>

14:26.666 --> 14:28.466
<i>Given the way</i>
<i>he looked then.</i>

14:28.468 --> 14:30.568
<i>And by that, I mean given</i>
<i>that he was dead.</i>

14:30.570 --> 14:32.070
Sykes:
Great news, captain.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.038
Turns out louis berg,
our dead shopkeeper,

14:34.040 --> 14:35.340
Was a total sleazebag.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.708
A lot of people
could've wanted him dead.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.409
Really?
No question.
And that market --

14:38.411 --> 14:41.045
It was mostly a front
for his gambling operation.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.513
Louis berg was a bookie.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.183
Which explains why the cameras
weren't recording.

14:45.185 --> 14:48.052
Detective sykes,
see if you can make a list

14:48.054 --> 14:50.288
Of mr. Berg's
gambling clientele.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.623
Thank you.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.157
<i>[ clears throat ]</i>
<i>uh, all right.</i>

14:53.159 --> 14:54.425
Provenza:
All right, lloyd, look at me.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.294
Now listen.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.329
Do you understand
that you could go to prison

14:58.331 --> 14:59.631
For the rest of your life?

14:59.633 --> 15:02.433
Okay, how dumb
do you guys think I am?

15:02.435 --> 15:05.370
No one gets life in prison
for stealing beer.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.338
<i>Not even</i>
<i>really good beer.</i>

15:07.340 --> 15:11.643
<i>For murder, lloyd!</i>
<i>You'll go to prison for murder!</i>

15:11.645 --> 15:14.612
In 30 years, I've never seen
a better case against anybody.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.713
Flynn: You know what?
The hell with it.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.448
I'm gonna arrest him now.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.583
Okay, w-wait!
Look.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.717
[ sighs ]

15:19.719 --> 15:22.253
A friend was with me
last night.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.188
<i>I told you</i>
<i>not to call anybody!</i>

15:24.190 --> 15:25.657
<i>It wasn't just anybody!</i>

15:25.659 --> 15:29.227
This is the most amazing woman
in the world.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.329
I've known her
since we were kids.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.298
We've dated off and on
since high school,

15:33.300 --> 15:34.399
And you can believe <i>her</i>

15:34.401 --> 15:36.100
When she says
I didn't kill anyone

15:36.102 --> 15:38.636
Because she is honest,
dependable,

15:38.638 --> 15:41.639
And absolutely
<i>not</i> a prostitute.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.374
"not a prostitute."

15:45.744 --> 15:48.746
What is her name?

15:48.748 --> 15:50.782
Her name is "shampagne."

15:52.084 --> 15:53.217
With an "s."

15:54.153 --> 15:55.520
And she has a website.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.094
[ sighs ]

16:03.096 --> 16:05.396
In the entire history
of crime,

16:05.398 --> 16:09.734
There has never been a reliable
alibi witness named shampagne.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.570
I am so sorry.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.372
I would have introduced myself
sooner,

16:14.374 --> 16:15.506
But it's been so busy here.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.541
You must be kris.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.643
Sharon, kris.

16:18.645 --> 16:22.146
This is my own personal
police captain.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.848
Kris: Oh, well,
it's so nice to meet you.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.117
Thanks for letting me come
and watch today.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.219
I was just telling kris
that this is an easy one

16:28.221 --> 16:30.254
Because you guys
already caught the murderer.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.289
Lloyd: No, they didn't!

16:31.291 --> 16:32.824
I didn't kill anyone!

16:32.826 --> 16:35.426
Um...

16:35.428 --> 16:39.197
I hope your parents
don't mind you being here.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.566
Oh, no. My parents
don't care where I am.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.134
Really?

16:43.136 --> 16:45.403
Uh, that's how much
they trust her.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.207
Captain, we found
the alibi witness.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.875
Excuse me.

16:50.877 --> 16:54.812
Shampagneintheglassxxx.Com.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.683
Sykes:
Says here she's an animal lover,

16:58.685 --> 17:00.318
Aspiring spokes model,

17:00.320 --> 17:02.820

I want to come over?

he'd be so unready to entertain,

to the nearby market

35:42.808 --> 35:43.940
No, no, no, no, no.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.275
I'll take the deal.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.877
You made
the right choice.

35:46.879 --> 35:49.546
Good. I'll write up
your statement of facts.

35:49.548 --> 35:52.582
You can sign it, and we'll
give it to judge richwood.

35:52.584 --> 35:53.884
And we'll all move on.
[ sighs ]

35:53.886 --> 35:56.953
Flynn:
Don't start with me, okay?!

35:56.955 --> 35:58.855
Hey, listen,
if you expect me to pay 30 grand

35:58.857 --> 36:01.291
Of my hard-earned money
for this wedding,

36:01.293 --> 36:03.460
I am walking her
down the aisle myself.

36:03.462 --> 36:04.861
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.830
Her stepfather hasn't
contributed a dime, okay?

36:06.832 --> 36:10.700
I'm gonna walk my little girl
to the altar alone.

36:10.702 --> 36:13.503
Flynn, be careful --
your blood pressure!
What? What the --

36:13.505 --> 36:15.972
You just told the entire world
that I have high blood pressure.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.507
Now everyone knows!

36:17.509 --> 36:18.608
They didn't hear me.

36:18.610 --> 36:19.609
Nobody heard me,
did they?

36:19.611 --> 36:20.744
I heard you!

36:20.746 --> 36:22.345
You said,
"high blood pressure."

36:22.347 --> 36:24.848
Explains a lot -- I mean,
not everything, but a lot.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.918
You see?
What did I ask you?
Just take it easy.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.719
Y-yank on your earlobe
or something.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.021
Don't tell me
to take it easy, okay?

36:31.023 --> 36:32.589
I asked you to do
one simple thing --

36:32.591 --> 36:34.457
Not tell anybody
about my blood pressure!

36:34.459 --> 36:36.459
What do you do?!
You tell the world!
It just slipped out!

36:36.461 --> 36:37.661
Oh, really?!
Really!

36:37.663 --> 36:38.795
Really?!
Really?!
Really.

36:41.332 --> 36:43.466
[ thud ]

36:43.468 --> 36:45.402
What's going on out there?

36:54.512 --> 36:56.079
Julio!

37:08.359 --> 37:09.492
<i>Rusty: Okay, uh,</i>
<i>just let me have it.</i>
<i>Shh.</i>
<i>What'd I miss?</i>  <i>Quiet.</i>

37:09.494 --> 37:10.694
<i>Kris: Nice try. No.</i>

37:10.696 --> 37:12.462
<i>Just think about it.</i>

37:12.464 --> 37:15.031
<i>That lieutenant provenza guy,</i>
<i>he's avuncular.</i>

37:15.033 --> 37:16.766
[ chuckles ]
means irresistible.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.501
[ laughs ]
look it up.

37:18.503 --> 37:21.037
<i>It's means, like,</i>
<i>kindly, like an uncle.</i>

37:21.039 --> 37:22.672
How's lieutenant flynn?

37:22.674 --> 37:25.642
Well, falling down
knocked some sense into him.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.978
He's starting the meds
he should've been on weeks ago.

37:27.980 --> 37:30.947
<i>Hey, so, um,</i>
<i>I was wondering...</i>
<i>Also, I told him if he didn't,</i>

37:30.949 --> 37:33.116
I'd put it in his files
and chain him to a desk.

37:33.118 --> 37:35.518
<i>...What is there to do in</i>
<i>los angeles over the weekend?</i>

37:35.520 --> 37:38.922
Oh, oh, oh.
Look at this.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.524
<i>I mean, if this were</i>
<i>san francisco or new york,</i>

37:41.526 --> 37:42.592
<i>I'd have a better idea,</i>

37:42.594 --> 37:45.695
But...
I don't know l.A.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.063
<i>Well, um...</i>

37:47.065 --> 37:50.934
<i>Well, this is</i>
<i>kind of different, but,</i>

37:50.936 --> 37:53.703
Um, there's a cemetery
<i>in hollywood</i>

37:53.705 --> 37:55.872
Where a lot of old actors
are buried,

37:55.874 --> 37:58.541
And during the summer,
they show movies there.

37:58.543 --> 38:00.610
Uh, somebody took me there...

38:00.612 --> 38:04.414
I mean,
I took somebody there once,

38:04.416 --> 38:06.850
And it was -- it was fun...

38:06.852 --> 38:09.019
F-for a little while.

38:09.021 --> 38:13.423
<i>Well, is there a chance</i>
<i>that maybe we could go?</i>

38:13.425 --> 38:16.026
Uh, oh, oh, kris, look,

38:16.028 --> 38:18.828
You may live in california,
but I live in a police state,

38:18.830 --> 38:22.565
And I can't go anywhere right
now without an l.A.P.D. Escort.

38:22.567 --> 38:25.135
<i>Maybe they wouldn't</i>
<i>mind coming.</i>

38:25.137 --> 38:27.604
Well, it's expensive --
overtime costs.

38:29.473 --> 38:32.709
But you know what?
I-I can ask.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.577
I mean, the worst thing
that can happen

38:34.579 --> 38:35.979
Is I could get a "no,"
right?

38:35.981 --> 38:37.580
Right.

38:37.582 --> 38:38.815
Right, okay.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.617
<i>All right,</i>
<i>well, I'll ask.</i>

38:40.619 --> 38:42.118
<i>[ laughing ] okay.</i>

38:42.120 --> 38:44.120
I'll be right back.

38:44.122 --> 38:46.523
Captain,
he's on his way out.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.791
He's gonna be --
oh.

38:53.197 --> 38:55.799
[ police radio chatter ]

38:58.135 --> 38:59.869
Oh, hi.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.471
Hey.
Hey.

39:01.473 --> 39:03.907
How's the studying going?

39:03.909 --> 39:05.008
It's fine.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.577
Um, I wanted
to ask you something.

39:07.579 --> 39:08.945
Is this a bad time?

39:08.947 --> 39:11.047
Oh, no, no,
it's, um, perfect.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.749
What?

39:12.751 --> 39:15.618
W-well, this last case
you've been working on,

39:15.620 --> 39:19.022
It's about discrediting
a material witness, right?

39:19.024 --> 39:20.657
Yes.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.225
Well, how'd that work out?

39:22.227 --> 39:24.260
Uh, well, uh,
in this case,

39:24.262 --> 39:27.097
The legal system
had an alternative. Why?

39:27.099 --> 39:28.998
I was just thinking about

39:29.000 --> 39:31.801
How serious
my situation really is.

39:31.803 --> 39:35.038
Oh, rusty, you're fine.
Don't worry about it.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.674
Is there, um...

39:37.676 --> 39:42.212
Anything else that, uh,
you'd like to ask me.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.049
No.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.651
No, not right now.
Uh...

39:50.121 --> 39:51.721
Thanks.

40:06.670 --> 40:08.638
Well, how'd it go?

40:08.640 --> 40:10.106
What happened?

40:10.108 --> 40:13.009
I'm not sure.

40:14.812 --> 40:16.846
Rusty: <i>Hey.</i>

40:16.848 --> 40:22.752
So [sighs] uh, this sucks,
<i>but she said no.</i>

40:22.754 --> 40:25.288
Kris: <i>Oh, well. Sorry.</i>

40:25.290 --> 40:27.123
Y-you said no?

40:27.125 --> 40:29.993
Just to keep me
out of your office?

40:29.995 --> 40:31.294
Lieutenant,
he never asked.

40:31.296 --> 40:34.230
<i>Safety first</i>
<i>around here, so...</i>

40:34.232 --> 40:35.965
Well...

40:35.967 --> 40:39.235
Maybe he's nervous.

40:39.237 --> 40:42.572
I don't think so.
<i>Lucky for us we still have</i>
<i>a lot of vocabulary cards</i>

40:42.574 --> 40:44.841
<i>To go through.</i>
<i>Right, that we do.</i>

40:44.843 --> 40:47.644
When my daughter
was rusty's age,

40:47.646 --> 40:51.147
She dated several boys
from her ballet school.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.249
It didn't go so well.

40:53.251 --> 40:54.984
<i>Okay, let's try obfuscate.</i>

40:54.986 --> 40:56.820
<i>Obfuscate.</i>

40:56.822 --> 40:59.322
[ sighs ]
<i>to make something</i>
<i>incomprehensible.</i>

40:59.324 --> 41:04.594
Anyway, I feel a month
of civility coming my way.

41:04.596 --> 41:05.628
Son of a --

41:05.630 --> 41:08.131
Ah.

41:09.733 --> 41:10.800
I mean...

41:10.802 --> 41:12.268
You're welcome.

41:12.270 --> 41:15.038
[ laughs ]

41:15.040 --> 41:17.607
<i>Correct again.</i>

41:17.609 --> 41:19.776
<i>Mendacious.</i>

41:19.778 --> 41:23.780
Misleading
or prone to lying.

41:23.782 --> 41:25.648
Mm-hmm.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.151
<i>All right, uh,</i>
<i>the next word is pariah.</i>

41:28.153 --> 41:30.019
Pariah -- an outcast.

41:30.021 --> 41:32.889
<i>His close friends</i>
<i>respected him,</i>

41:32.891 --> 41:32.922
But the rest of the world
viewed him as a pariah.
