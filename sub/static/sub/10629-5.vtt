[reporter on TV] <i>Lucas Goodwin was</i>
<i>released from a federal detention center</i>

two months ago.</i>

03:07.645 --> 03:10.858
<i>FBI investigators searched
his witness protection residence</i>

03:10.941 --> 03:12.985
<i>- in Dayton, Ohio...</i>
- [Doug] Why was he even out of jail?

03:13.068 --> 03:15.738
[Green] He helped the DOJ
with an ongoing investigation.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.072
[Doug whispering]
How did you not know that?

03:17.155 --> 03:20.242
[Green whispering] WITSEC.
Only need-to-know for security reasons.

03:21.451 --> 03:25.455
We found this today at his house.
A suicide note, I guess.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.179
[softly] This can't go public.

03:41.263 --> 03:45.183
We haven't told the press anything.
But this is evidence.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.019
Once the report comes out...

04:03.160 --> 04:04.286
Email this to me.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.757
Mrs. Underwood?

04:17.841 --> 04:20.427
It's two o'clock in the morning.
Would you like to go home?

04:20.510 --> 04:22.012
[Claire] Oh, yes,
I'll be out in a moment.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.430

[Blythe] <i>What does that mean, exactly?</i>

05:05.472 --> 05:07.933
[Dr. Saxon] He needs a transplant,
or he'll die.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.353
- How soon?
- Days.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.939
We've made him Status 1.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.150
I'm optimistic
we'll find him a suitable liver.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.693
The recipient list is classified.

05:18.776 --> 05:21.571
You're the only two members
of the administration who've been briefed.

05:21.654 --> 05:25.492
- Is the First Lady aware?
- Yes, I informed her this afternoon.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.334
- [knocking on door]
- [Blythe] May I?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.461
Please.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.381
I know it's late,
but they said you were up, so...

05:39.464 --> 05:41.674
[sighing] No, I know.
I just hadn't eaten all day.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.218
I'm sure you haven't.

05:43.301 --> 05:46.388
- Would you like some salad?
- Sure. Thank you.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.516
[Blythe sighing]

05:51.726 --> 05:53.896
It's scary, about Frank.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.774
Well, Francis is a fighter.

05:57.857 --> 06:01.444
I wish I could ask his advice.
I have my call with Petrov in the morning.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.869
I feel good about
my understanding of the plan.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.957
My concern is him
railroading me on the call.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.335
Well, would you like me to be on it?
An extra set of ears.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.007
I don't... I don't know
how Cathy would feel about that.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.010
Well, she doesn't need to know.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.346
I could just listen from up here.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.225
And maybe I could type a note
if you get into trouble.

We're all out for today, sir.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.562

07:24.152 --> 07:25.403
Hey, uh...

07:26.404 --> 07:28.323
can I siphon a couple of gallons from you?

07:29.324 --> 07:30.908
Fifty bucks.
I'm running on fumes.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.535

07:32.619 --> 07:34.246

Mr. President.

[Petrov] <i>All of Russia is praying</i>

09:07.214 --> 09:10.133
<i>I hope you will extend
my warm thoughts to Mrs. Underwood.</i>

09:10.217 --> 09:11.218
I certainly will.

09:11.301 --> 09:15.888
You're a brave man to take over
during such difficult times.

09:15.972 --> 09:19.059
[Blythe] <i>I just want to make sure we find</i>
<i>a manageable resolution to this oil--</i>

09:19.142 --> 09:21.978
I've read some of your books,
Mr. President.

09:22.062 --> 09:26.108
I just finished <i>Learning to Learn.</i>
It was good.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.359
Thank you.

09:27.442 --> 09:31.071
<i>There was a chapter on visualization
that really interested me.</i>

09:31.154 --> 09:34.282
Yes, it's a... a tool for students.
It helps them--

09:34.366 --> 09:37.785
I would like you
to visualize something.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.206
<i>Now, you're standing in the tundra.</i>

09:41.289 --> 09:43.958
Um, wind, snow...

09:44.626 --> 09:47.295
<i>machines drilling through the ice,</i>

09:47.379 --> 09:50.923
long pipelines stretching to the horizon.
Do you see?

09:51.007 --> 09:53.760
If you want to talk about Siberia,
I'm more than happy to--

09:53.843 --> 09:59.099
No, no, no. You're not visualizing,
Mr. Vice President.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.644
Close your eyes.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.195
All right. They're closed.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.781
Good. Now...
[claps hands]

10:14.864 --> 10:19.911
picture the men working
those drills and pipelines.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.371
What do they look like?

10:22.455 --> 10:25.583
Um, heavy coats, gloves, boots.

10:26.418 --> 10:29.212
Are they... Chinese?

10:32.465 --> 10:38.221
You see, when I picture this,
I don't see Chinese.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.141
I agree with you. The less control
the Chinese have, the better.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.268
Then why did you send Milkin to China?

10:43.351 --> 10:46.354
You weren't negotiating with us.
We thought they might have more luck.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.898
Their demands would leave us
worse off than we were before.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.067
[Blythe] <i>I can get the IMF</i>
<i>to provide half the bailout.</i>

10:51.151 --> 10:53.445
<i>This would counteract the Chinese demands
for drilling rights--</i>

10:53.528 --> 10:56.823
- You are playing us off each other.
<i>- Mr. President--</i>

10:56.906 --> 11:00.743
I think you're in
over your head, Mr. Blythe.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.454
If you would just give me
a chance to elaborate--

11:02.537 --> 11:03.663
<i>Why give you a chance?</i>

11:03.746 --> 11:06.123
<i>What do you know about Russia?
About China?</i>

11:06.208 --> 11:08.125
[stuttering] I've been briefed on--

11:08.210 --> 11:10.795
Forgive me, but, uh...

11:10.878 --> 11:15.592
I don't feel comfortable negotiating
with anyone other than the president.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.511
<i>When he recovers,
perhaps he and I can speak.</i>

11:20.597 --> 11:23.766
[Petrov smacks lips]
<i>So, are we finished?</i>

11:25.935 --> 11:28.438
[inhales deeply] The president's
in very bad shape.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.064
[whispers] Sir...

11:30.147 --> 11:31.733
[Petrov] <i>How serious is it?</i>

11:38.281 --> 11:39.949
He needs a liver transplant.

11:41.576 --> 11:44.246
I wasn't aware that...

11:44.329 --> 11:45.955
[sighs]

11:46.038 --> 11:47.999
You better get used to
negotiating with me.

11:48.082 --> 11:51.586
If the president dies, it's you and I...

11:51.669 --> 11:53.421
<i>or nothing at all.</i>

11:55.423 --> 12:00.803
My apologies, Mr. President.
I didn't intend to insult you.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.431
Let's keep a dialogue open.
That's all I'm asking.

12:03.515 --> 12:06.476
I'd like the opportunity to present you
with a detailed proposal

12:06.559 --> 12:07.894
<i>countering the Chinese demands.</i>

12:07.977 --> 12:10.772
I'll have Secretary Durant
work with your foreign minister,

12:10.855 --> 12:13.065
and then we'll take it from there.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.484
<i>Are you open to that?</i>

12:15.902 --> 12:17.695
Of course.

12:17.779 --> 12:21.032
I look forward to reviewing your proposal.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.576
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- [phone beeps]

12:23.660 --> 12:26.037
Sir, we didn't want that
to get out to the press yet.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.664
The American people
deserve to know, anyway.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.957
Sir, the Russians don't respond
well to weakness.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.418
Now that they know
that the president--

12:31.501 --> 12:34.128
You heard him say
he's open to negotiation.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.755
I'd say that's progress.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.646
[Kate] Four days and still nothing?
No press conference, no briefing.

12:51.729 --> 12:55.066
[Seth] We have to let them conduct
their investigation on their own terms.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.777
- Feels like we're being shut out.
- This isn't just the bureau.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.237
They have to coordinate with Homeland
and make sure nothing sensitive--

13:00.322 --> 13:01.531
That's bullshit.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.658
There's something about Goodwin
that you don't want us to know.

13:03.741 --> 13:04.909
Wrong.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.579
I wanna know why he did this
just as much as you do...

13:07.662 --> 13:09.997
but we've gotta let the FBI do its job.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.012
[Tom] Same theory as when I visited him.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.932
[Schiller] And that was before
he struck the plea, correct?

13:28.015 --> 13:31.644
I encouraged him to plead guilty.
His claims were unsubstantiated.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.270
Tell us about your meeting
with the president

13:33.355 --> 13:34.647
prior to that meeting with Goodwin.

13:34.731 --> 13:38.025
Lucas asked me to investigate.
I did.

13:38.109 --> 13:40.445
That involved an interview
with Underwood.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.655
[Morgan] You still have your notes?

13:42.739 --> 13:44.031
No notes without a warrant.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.745
- [telephone ringing]
- [grumbling]

13:50.329 --> 13:52.749
- The press. Calling non-stop.
- [ringing stops]

13:52.832 --> 13:54.834
We suggest you don't speak to anyone
while we're still--

13:54.917 --> 13:57.879
Don't worry. I don't have any interest
in getting dragged into this.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.798
[sighs heavily]
Let me go dig up those notes.

14:33.915 --> 14:38.378
Blythe... He told Petrov
the president needs a transplant.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.798
- Why would he do that?
- Petrov got under his skin.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.216
This is why we should've carried out
your husband's plan.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.635
We're giving Moscow
too much room to maneuver--

14:45.718 --> 14:49.263
Let's not debate
what we can't change, Doug.

14:49.346 --> 14:52.475
If Moscow knows,
we'll have to notify the press.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.978
We're doing that tomorrow.
Dr. Saxon will do the briefing.

14:56.979 --> 15:00.149
No, I'll do it.
It's better coming from the First Lady.

15:02.444 --> 15:03.695
I agree.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.323
We need to address this, too.

15:07.949 --> 15:10.326
The FBI found Goodwin's notes
in his house.

15:11.744 --> 15:15.498
- Can we make them disappear?
- No, it's already been catalogued.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.292
We need to get out ahead of it
and control the story.

15:18.375 --> 15:22.379
All right. Get me a copy
and report on the investigation so far.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.340
I wanna see him.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.592
The president.

15:25.675 --> 15:28.385
The Secret Service still won't let me.

15:28.470 --> 15:31.347
I'd like Mr. Stamper to have access
to my husband, please.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.224
We have strict orders, ma'am.
Only you and--

15:33.307 --> 15:35.935
Would you like me to call
the vice president myself?

15:36.018 --> 15:38.270
Douglas, this young man
will escort you to his room.

15:38.354 --> 15:39.689
Thank you.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.403

16:57.809 --> 16:59.476
[EKG machine beeping]

17:03.565 --> 17:06.400
- What time is it?
- It's a little past 7:00.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.829
Sir? Sir, it's Doug.

17:17.912 --> 17:21.207
Just because his eyes are open
doesn't mean he's fully conscious.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.041
[Dr. Saxon] Insufficient liver function.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.045
His brain is swimming
in a pool of unprocessed ammonia.

17:26.127 --> 17:29.048
If he's seeing anything,
it's probably severe hallucinations.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.550
[Doug distorted]
How long until he has a liver?

17:30.633 --> 17:33.219
[Dr. Saxon] Could be hours.
Could be days.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.345
[distorted] He's number three on the list.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.013
[Doug] Number three?

17:36.097 --> 17:39.559
It's prioritized in terms of need
and who was listed first as a Status 1.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.645
- He's the President of the United States.
- It's the law.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.733
[clamoring]

17:46.816 --> 17:48.525

18:18.097 --> 18:20.099
The attorney general is resigning.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.477
Add that to the press release
for this afternoon.

18:24.561 --> 18:27.815
- Uh, her decision or the vice president's?
- My decision.

18:27.899 --> 18:30.067
Goodwin's WITSEC
was a DOJ responsibility.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.653
We needed a head to roll.

18:31.736 --> 18:34.864
First hers... then yours.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.285
You'll resign tomorrow.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.961
[sighs] Doug, I know you're under
a lot of pressure, but--

18:49.045 --> 18:51.798
You sent the photo of the rebel soldier.

18:52.882 --> 18:56.803
- That's not true.
- Personal phone, off the premises.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.014
You know, maybe somebody hacked
my account or something--

19:00.097 --> 19:01.933
Are you really gonna keep lying to me?

19:02.016 --> 19:03.726
I could have you arrested.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.771
But I'd rather you go quietly.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.528
I know things, Doug.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.990
Nothing you can prove.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.535
Now, threaten me again.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.263
There's no proposal
without China's involvement.

19:41.347 --> 19:45.685
Now, Cathy's tried, but she doesn't have
the best relationship with them.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.145
Maybe she needs some help.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.563
Help? How?

19:53.234 --> 19:56.195
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- [chuckles] Of course not.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.160
I quit about ten years ago.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.372
Marjory forced me to.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.713
Ah, still smells delicious.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.889
What was it like when Marjory died?

20:22.972 --> 20:26.350
Oh, well, it was, um... [sighs]

20:27.268 --> 20:29.520
I'm sorry. We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.230
No, it's fine.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.817
We hadn't had a real conversation in...
in months.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.402
Her mind was gone.

20:37.361 --> 20:43.284
When she finally died,
it felt like a limb had been hacked off.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.578
I felt... devastated.

20:47.496 --> 20:51.834
But I also felt relieved.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.757
That's what I feel about my mother.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.218
Oh, I hadn't--
It hadn't even occurred to me.

21:01.302 --> 21:02.594
You have Frank and your mother.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.682
When my father died, it destroyed me,

21:06.766 --> 21:10.186
but when I think about Mother,
I feel nothing.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.980
- You two aren't close?
- No.

21:16.525 --> 21:20.196
And I feel the same about Francis.
Nothing.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.869
I know that must sound awful.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.497
It's a lot to process.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.376
There's no right way or wrong way.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.092
- Ah! Wait, hold on.
- No.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.344
- [sighs and groans]
- Marjory wouldn't approve.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.720
[chuckles]

21:44.804 --> 21:47.431
- We got sidetracked.
- Yes.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.558
China.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.937
I have an idea,
if you can trust me to handle it.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.482
I'd trust you
with my goddamn life, Claire.

21:57.608 --> 22:00.777
- [Remy's father speaking French]
- [Remy] You don't want to know.

22:00.862 --> 22:02.279
[Remy's father laughs]

22:05.574 --> 22:10.162
- [Remy sighs]
- [conversing in French]

22:12.706 --> 22:14.041
[chuckles]

22:14.125 --> 22:17.044
I got it. Ah, <i>merci.</i>

22:24.844 --> 22:26.929
[speaking French]

22:28.389 --> 22:30.516
[Remy responds in French]

22:33.644 --> 22:37.689
- [Remy] LeAnn.
- You are a tough guy to track down.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.526
- What are you doing here?
- You have a plane to catch.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.361
The First Lady needs your help.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.238
I don't want to have
anything to do with them.

22:44.321 --> 22:47.533
Whatever you think of the president,
you still have a duty to your country.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.036
Even if he dies,
the day I walked out the White House,

22:50.119 --> 22:51.954
I promised myself I wasn't going back.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.915
You don't even know
what we have in mind.

22:53.998 --> 22:57.001
It doesn't matter.
I'm not going.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.544
I'd like you to leave.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.799
- Here's your briefing materials.
- [sighs] You're not hearing me.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.426
You should really take a look.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.442
[LeAnn] Her campaign would be over.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.363
And what would your parents think?

23:33.495 --> 23:35.831
[man] It looks like you're taking
advantage of the fact that he's--

23:35.914 --> 23:37.124
[Dunbar] Conway is still campaigning.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.626
[man] He's a Republican and
he's already wrapped up his nomination.

23:39.710 --> 23:40.711
Apples and oranges.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.505
We are gonna lose, if we sit still,
to a guy who's unconscious.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.300
Heather's right. Underwood's scoring
major sympathy points.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.427
He's ahead in six
of the next seven states.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.180
We need to keep the pressure up.
Russia, gas prices...

23:51.263 --> 23:53.557
Attack a president
who's fighting for his life?

23:53.640 --> 23:57.436
I didn't call this meeting to debate.
I want those states back.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.647
So let's start organizing events
and media hits.

24:00.731 --> 24:03.109
Prelim budgets and schedules,
by tomorrow morning.

24:04.318 --> 24:07.989
[reporter on TV] <i>There has been much</i>
<i>speculation as to Goodwin's motivations.</i>

24:08.072 --> 24:09.240
Cynthia.

24:10.866 --> 24:14.703
- Where are we on Goodwin?
- The security guy's taken care of.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.373
He never saw the two of you together.

24:18.624 --> 24:22.128
- What about others?
- None that he knows of.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.005
But it's not like we can ask around.

24:25.672 --> 24:27.216
[reporter on TV]
<i>In November of 2013,</i>

24:27.299 --> 24:30.344
<i>Ms. Barnes was struck
by a D.C. Metrorail train.</i>

24:30.427 --> 24:34.306
<i>D.C. police classified it as an accident.
Some have speculated that...</i>

24:53.325 --> 24:54.660
Have a seat, Remy.

25:02.376 --> 25:05.462
[sighs] Sorry about Frank.

25:05.546 --> 25:08.340
Oh, please, don't bother.
I've had enough people say they're sorry,

25:08.424 --> 25:09.841
and I know you don't mean it.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.678
I can't help you
the way you want me to.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.888
LeAnn told me she was
very clear with you.

25:14.971 --> 25:16.014
It won't work.

25:16.098 --> 25:18.184
Tusk wants to help you
even less than I do.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.519
Well, nobody's doing
any favors here, Remy.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.313
He's going to get very rich from this.

25:22.396 --> 25:25.357
- Why don't you speak to him yourself?
- Because he won't listen to me.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.818
This needs to seem
like your idea, not mine.

25:28.610 --> 25:31.322
- And you'll make a killing, too.
- I don't need the money.

25:31.863 --> 25:34.908
Hmm. Because you care about
other things now.

25:36.493 --> 25:37.994
Like Jackie.

25:39.246 --> 25:41.498
Which is why you'll make this happen.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.298
If I had told Dunbar about Frank...

25:50.424 --> 25:53.094
about how he knew
about the laundering,

25:53.177 --> 25:56.263
he wouldn't be president
and we wouldn't be standing here.

25:56.347 --> 26:00.142
But you didn't and you can't now,
so here we are.

26:01.518 --> 26:05.647
Two hours and we got nowhere.
All he wants to hear is China.

26:05.731 --> 26:08.650
I told him Beijing is not responsive.
He doesn't give a damn.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.402
The First Lady put a bug in his ear.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.821
Well, whatever bug she put in there
won't crawl out.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.615
I'll set up a meeting.
Just you, me and him.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.450
I don't think a meeting is enough.

26:16.533 --> 26:20.078
We have a vice president that
does not know what he is doing, Doug.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.123
He needs to completely turn over

26:22.206 --> 26:24.208
all diplomatic affairs
to the State Department.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.252
- Otherwise, my hands are tied.
- Not now.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.669
This can't wait.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.338
When we're finished,
I will come and find you.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.299
Could you give us a few moments,
Madam Secretary?

26:32.383 --> 26:34.510
- Seth, you're out of line!
- It's all right.

26:35.969 --> 26:36.970
Call me.

26:37.888 --> 26:40.056
I will.
Thank you, Cathy.

26:40.682 --> 26:41.850
Thank you.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.937
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You can't fire me.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.482
You don't interrupt a meeting
with the Secretary of State.

26:48.565 --> 26:51.527
I can end Dunbar's campaign.
We can end it today.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.487
How?

26:54.321 --> 26:56.490
If I deliver, will you keep me on?

26:57.241 --> 26:58.575
You tell me how first.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.626
Have a seat, Martha.

27:17.428 --> 27:19.971
[Doug] I've had second thoughts
about your resignation.

27:24.393 --> 27:26.687
Would you like to remain
as attorney general?

27:26.770 --> 27:28.814
Yes, I would.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.107
Thank you, Doug.

27:32.401 --> 27:36.154
Did Heather Dunbar inform you of a meeting
between herself and Lucas Goodwin?

27:37.113 --> 27:40.075
You're having me interrogated
by my own subordinates?

27:40.158 --> 27:42.744
They only work for you
if you keep your job.

27:42.828 --> 27:45.206
I suggest you answer their questions.

27:45.289 --> 27:48.250
- I'd like a lawyer present.
- [Green] Let me remind you, ma'am.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.462
Failing to have informed us
constitutes withholding of evidence.

27:52.254 --> 27:53.755
Heather is a friend.

27:53.839 --> 27:57.593
It's very simple, Martha.
You work with us, you stay on as AG.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.511
You don't, we prosecute.

28:05.476 --> 28:08.770
[Seth] Ladies and Gentlemen,
the First Lady of the United States.

28:08.854 --> 28:11.022
[camera shutters clicking]

28:11.106 --> 28:12.483
[Claire] Good afternoon, everyone.

28:12.566 --> 28:15.236
I'd like to update you
on my husband's recovery.

28:16.152 --> 28:20.073
The president's medical team
gave me a full assessment last night

28:20.156 --> 28:21.867
and they have come to the conclusion

28:21.950 --> 28:27.581
that the president is in need
of a liver transplant if he's to survive.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.375
[hushed murmuring]

28:31.377 --> 28:36.089
<i>I'm asking the nation to pray with me</i>

28:36.172 --> 28:39.301
<i>that a healthy liver
makes its way to Francis soon.</i>

28:41.262 --> 28:43.179
[voice breaking]
<i>I'm sorry. A moment.</i>

28:44.723 --> 28:46.517
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

28:46.600 --> 28:48.101
She's good, isn't she?

28:50.521 --> 28:53.064
- What're you doing here?
- [Claire] <i>As for the investigation...</i>

28:53.148 --> 28:54.775
First Lady wanted some support.

28:54.858 --> 28:58.654
<i>...the FBI director of counterterrorism
will give you a full briefing. But...</i>

28:58.737 --> 29:01.657
I feel it's important
to personally address

29:01.740 --> 29:04.243
the document found
in Mr. Goodwin's residence

29:04.326 --> 29:08.455
that was made available to you
just before this conference.

29:08.539 --> 29:11.750
It's filled with language that would make
for flashy headlines,

29:11.833 --> 29:15.003
words like "murder," "corruption."

29:15.086 --> 29:19.090
The accusation that the president
was involved in the deaths

29:19.174 --> 29:21.343
of Peter Russo and Zoe Barnes.

29:21.927 --> 29:27.641
<i>Phrases like "abuse of power,"
while they have no basis in reality,</i>

29:27.724 --> 29:31.437
<i>they do give us a sad glimpse
into a very troubled mind.</i>

29:31.520 --> 29:36.858
<i>And it pains me that anyone,
even someone who is mentally ill,</i>

29:36.942 --> 29:41.071
<i>would think my husband is capable
of what Mr. Goodwin believed to be true.</i>

29:42.030 --> 29:44.700
<i>But mostly it pains me
for Mr. Goodwin's parents,</i>

29:45.200 --> 29:47.411
who are coping
with the loss of their son.

29:47.494 --> 29:50.289
And, by all accounts,
he was a decent man for most of his life,

29:50.372 --> 29:53.208
but clearly, something snapped in him

29:53.292 --> 29:55.919
and he never got the help
he so desperately needed.

29:56.002 --> 29:59.381
So I ask that all of you
respect his parents' grief

29:59.465 --> 30:02.759
by not sensationalizing
the words of a sick young man.

30:03.719 --> 30:06.221
And let's remember
Lawrence and Betty Meechum,

30:06.305 --> 30:11.352
whose son Edward gave his life because
of Mr. Goodwin's illness.

30:11.435 --> 30:15.105
<i>Edward's sacrifice is the only reason
my husband is still alive.</i>

30:15.188 --> 30:19.568
<i>And I'll be forever grateful for
his friendship and his devoted service.</i>

30:19.651 --> 30:20.819
Thank you.

30:20.902 --> 30:23.113
[clamoring]

30:25.156 --> 30:27.701
[Seth] Counterterrorism Director
Nathan Green.

30:28.952 --> 30:32.414
[Green] Today we had a new development
in the investigation.

30:32.498 --> 30:35.083
This afternoon,
we interviewed the attorney general.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.628
She gave us a full account
of a conversation she had

30:37.711 --> 30:40.005
with Heather Dunbar
the day of the shooting.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.425
<i>In this conversation,
Ms. Dunbar claimed to have met</i>

30:43.509 --> 30:45.886
<i>with Lucas Goodwin personally.</i>

30:45.969 --> 30:47.721
<i>And while we have no reason to believe</i>

30:47.804 --> 30:51.057
<i>Ms. Dunbar had anything to do
with the assassination attempt...</i>

30:51.975 --> 30:55.228
<i>we will be questioning her
about this alleged conversation.</i>

30:55.311 --> 30:56.563
[Cynthia] Are you arresting her?

30:56.647 --> 30:58.231
[Schiller] No, ma'am.
We're here to ask a few questions.

30:58.314 --> 31:00.567
- Then you need to make a formal request.
- [Morgan] Is she here now?

31:00.651 --> 31:02.110
[Cynthia] Send the request directly to me,

31:02.193 --> 31:03.987
and then I'll discuss it
with Ms. Dunbar's attorneys.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.572
[doorbell rings]

31:11.244 --> 31:12.328
Hey, Kate.

31:12.413 --> 31:14.623
I tried calling.
Home and cell.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.000
Pulled out the cord.
Turned off the cell.

31:17.083 --> 31:19.002
Because of people like me.

31:19.085 --> 31:21.755
The others had the courtesy
not to show up on my doorstep.

31:21.838 --> 31:24.883
- Courtesy never got me anywhere.
- [chuckles]

31:25.676 --> 31:28.845
Can we talk?
Off the record.

31:28.929 --> 31:29.930
[inhales deeply]

31:30.847 --> 31:34.560
- If it were anyone but you...
- Well, luckily, it isn't.

31:37.438 --> 31:39.481
Let me get Fausto.
It's time for his walk.

31:41.357 --> 31:44.528
I'm in the nuclear game, not fossil fuels.

31:45.153 --> 31:47.363
No one has the relationships
you do in China.

31:47.448 --> 31:48.574
Ha!

31:49.240 --> 31:50.742
Chinese disowned me.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.161
[Remy] They'll come around.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.331
[Raymond] Who put you up to this?

31:57.833 --> 32:01.086
- [Remy] Starting my own firm.
- I thought you were out?

32:01.169 --> 32:03.589
[Remy chuckles] I was fooling myself.

32:05.298 --> 32:08.384
[Raymond] So, president gets shot,

32:08.469 --> 32:11.680
and you just can't help
taking advantage of the chaos.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.976
What you call chaos, I call opportunity.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.268
[Raymond chuckles]

32:18.979 --> 32:20.355
And you're my first client.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.316
[Raymond sighs]

32:24.901 --> 32:26.487
I wish you the best.

32:27.863 --> 32:29.906
But I'm not your first client.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.201
I don't wanna have
anything to do with the White House.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.704
You lost a lot of money
during the Walker scandal.

32:37.163 --> 32:40.917
I did, indeed,
which is why I'm turning you down.

32:41.918 --> 32:44.880
I'm sorry you came
all the way out here for a "no."

32:53.429 --> 32:55.098
You don't wanna go to prison, do you?

32:56.016 --> 32:58.351
- Hmm.
- Lose the rest of it?

32:58.434 --> 33:00.061
I've already been pardoned.

33:02.230 --> 33:05.108
For the money laundering,
not for perjury.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.112
You said that Walker knew, and he didn't.

33:09.195 --> 33:12.323
What you didn't say
is that you were working with Frank.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.287
Why should anybody
believe you more than me?

33:17.370 --> 33:18.664
You take that chance...

33:19.247 --> 33:21.249
and watch Clayton West
become a penny stock.

33:22.834 --> 33:26.212
Or we're heroes
for ending the oil crisis,

33:26.296 --> 33:29.007
everybody gets rich,
your image is restored.

33:31.426 --> 33:34.596
They'll probably even let you choose
the next ambassador in Beijing.

33:41.812 --> 33:44.022
[Kate] So you don't think
any of it is true?

33:44.105 --> 33:45.691
No.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.568
And I wanted to believe him.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.279
So the First Lady's
whole teary-eyed thing?

33:51.362 --> 33:56.743
[sighing] I think she's right.
Something in Lucas snapped.

33:56.827 --> 34:00.038
I mean, the Lucas I knew
wouldn't have tried to kill a president.

34:00.121 --> 34:02.999
Exactly. That's my point.

34:03.083 --> 34:06.628
You honestly think
Underwood was murdering people?

34:06.712 --> 34:08.170
Where is your skepticism?

34:08.254 --> 34:11.466
I'm skeptical of Lucas and
I'm skeptical of the White House.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.927
How come there's no proof?
None.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.598
After Lucas tried, after I tried.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.226
My advice is to let it go.

34:21.309 --> 34:24.312
[inhales deeply] You're gonna repeat
the same goose chase we did.

34:25.521 --> 34:26.732
I had to ask.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.694
- What does your editor say?
- To let it go.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.402
[chuckles] You see?

34:32.487 --> 34:35.406
- He's not as good as you are.
- Was.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.868
Wish you were at <i>The Telegraph.</i>

34:38.784 --> 34:40.911
Yeah, let me know if anyone gets fired.

34:47.628 --> 34:49.379
[knocking on door]

34:49.462 --> 34:51.047
It's open.

34:55.467 --> 34:57.178
[sighs]

34:57.262 --> 34:58.554
I came as soon as I got your text.

34:58.639 --> 35:00.766
We've been slammed
since the press conference.

35:00.849 --> 35:01.892
How's it lookin'?

35:02.433 --> 35:04.352
[clicks tongue]
Major play on the Dunbar story.

35:05.812 --> 35:08.064
It was a good idea
to have the First Lady talk.

35:08.982 --> 35:10.066
You want a soda?

35:10.651 --> 35:12.235
A glass of water or anything?

35:13.153 --> 35:14.320
Water's fine.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.498
[Doug] I've decided you can stay.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.960
[Seth] Doug, I hope you can understand.

35:30.086 --> 35:31.171
I got nervous.

35:32.088 --> 35:33.840
You know, things weren't
looking good and...

35:34.925 --> 35:37.427
yeah, I wanted an out,
in case I needed one.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.805
I mean, it was a mistake.
I wish I hadn't.

35:39.888 --> 35:43.224
[Doug] You corrected your mistakes.
That's all that matters. You want ice?

35:43.308 --> 35:44.810
Sure.

35:53.526 --> 35:56.237
We can't afford any more shake-ups
in the campaign right now,

35:56.321 --> 35:58.364
especially with the president
in the hospital.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.075
Mmm-hmm.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.911
We also can't afford
any more of your mistakes. [grunts]

36:02.994 --> 36:04.746
[both grunting]

36:05.914 --> 36:09.042
Shut up. Shut up!

36:10.126 --> 36:12.587
When I first woke up,
I couldn't speak.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.673
I had to blink my eyes
if I wanted to respond.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.342
- Do you understand?
- [gasps]

36:18.009 --> 36:22.138
If I can't get your loyalty,
I will have your obedience.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.099
Blink.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.978
- Blink!
- [Seth whimpering]

36:28.061 --> 36:29.395
- [Seth grunting]
- [Doug straining]

36:29.479 --> 36:31.690
[gasping] Fuck!

36:33.149 --> 36:35.151
[panting]

36:37.821 --> 36:39.322
[coughs]

36:41.032 --> 36:42.450
[groans]

36:43.326 --> 36:44.745
Fucking...

36:51.710 --> 36:52.711
Here.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.922
You're fucked up, man.

37:06.641 --> 37:07.642
[door slams]

37:12.105 --> 37:13.815
- [doorbell rings]
- [dog barking]

37:14.900 --> 37:16.692
- Quit it.
- Good morning, Mr. Hammerschmidt.

37:16.777 --> 37:17.778
How can I help you?

37:17.861 --> 37:21.281
Uh, we're just returning your notes.
We made copies. These are the originals.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.866
Nothing too useful, huh?

37:22.949 --> 37:24.951
No, sir, but thank you
for your cooperation.

37:25.035 --> 37:27.287
Your paper, too.
It was on the step.

37:27.370 --> 37:29.205
Well, you have a good day,
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

37:29.289 --> 37:30.791
You, too.

37:33.794 --> 37:35.003
[dog panting]

37:36.838 --> 37:38.006
[dog barking]

37:38.089 --> 37:41.927
Don't tell me you're hungry already.
I just fed you. Good God.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.429
I'm coming. I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

37:49.017 --> 37:50.726
[barking]

38:13.291 --> 38:14.459
[clears throat]

38:20.381 --> 38:22.926
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

38:29.599 --> 38:32.143
I suggest we turn the negotiations
over to Cathy.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.020
If we keep stalling on Russia,
gas prices will--

38:34.104 --> 38:35.480
Now is not a good time.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.942
I won't have the president come back
to a White House in disarray.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.526
We don't know that he is coming back.

38:41.694 --> 38:44.364
He is. I promise you that.

38:45.698 --> 38:48.534
Are you God?
Who are you to say?

38:48.618 --> 38:50.578
- [phone beeps]
- Yes?

38:50.661 --> 38:54.124
- [woman] <i>Mr. Tusk and Mr. Danton are here.</i>
- Send them in.

38:54.207 --> 38:56.626
It was arranged this morning.
We're discussing Russia.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.169
Sir, I am the Chief of Staff.

38:58.253 --> 38:59.712
You have to keep me
informed of these things.

38:59.795 --> 39:00.839
Excuse me,

39:00.922 --> 39:03.842
but I believe you answer to me,
not the other way around.

39:03.925 --> 39:05.551
Secretary Durant should be here.

39:05.635 --> 39:07.929
This meeting is private.
I'll discuss it with you both after.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.056
The president would never allow
Raymond--

39:10.974 --> 39:12.893
- Mr. President.
- Mr. Tusk.

39:14.519 --> 39:15.686
Remy, good to see you.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.813
- Mr. President.
- Mr. Stamper.

39:19.274 --> 39:21.192
[Blythe] I'll follow up
with you later, Doug.

39:21.276 --> 39:22.318
Yes, sir.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.655
Thanks for taking the time
to meet with us on such short notice.

39:25.738 --> 39:28.449
Well, there's no time to waste
on this oil thing.

39:28.533 --> 39:30.701
I've made some progress
with the Chinese.

39:31.286 --> 39:32.871
Sir, the First Lady is in there right now.

39:32.954 --> 39:34.247
She's expecting me.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.834
[EKG machine beeping]

39:41.129 --> 39:43.339
We're trying to win an election,
and you want to remind everyone

39:43.423 --> 39:45.341
that the president
pardoned Raymond Tusk?

39:45.425 --> 39:48.719
- Let's find somewhere else.
- These are matters of state.

39:48.803 --> 39:51.097
You don't have the authority to intervene.

39:51.181 --> 39:53.433
If Donald wants my counsel,
that is his prerogative.

39:53.516 --> 39:55.101
You are deliberately deceiving me.

39:55.185 --> 39:58.313
- Going behind my--
- You have forgotten your place, Douglas.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.649
My place?
What about your place?

40:01.732 --> 40:03.651
You leave him when he needs you most,
you threaten him,

40:03.734 --> 40:05.653
and now that he's in here,
you undermine him.

40:05.736 --> 40:08.406
- You're supposed to be--
- Stop. That is enough.

40:08.489 --> 40:11.993
I will fill you in on everything,
but not here. At the White House.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.620
- [EKG machine beeping rapidly]
- [medical alarm sounds]

40:14.704 --> 40:16.497
- What's happening?
- His heart.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.461
- Doctor?
- He's had some sporadic arrhythmia.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.546
- Will you give us the room for a moment?
- Of course.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.848
We can't keep battling each other,
not with him like this.

40:33.932 --> 40:37.268
We need a new path forward,
and I would like your help with that.

40:37.352 --> 40:39.812
I promise I won't keep you in the dark.

40:41.647 --> 40:44.150
I'll meet you at the White House
whenever you're ready.

40:44.234 --> 40:47.820
I'm staying here.
I think this is more important.

40:49.197 --> 40:50.365
Okay.

41:02.252 --> 41:04.004
[Raymond] Mrs. Underwood.

41:04.087 --> 41:08.383
Mr. Tusk and Mr. Danton have a proposal
about how to deal with Russia.

41:09.550 --> 41:12.387
I imagine I'm the last person
you expected to see today.

41:13.888 --> 41:17.142
I am a bit surprised, yes,
to see both of you.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.978
I'm sure there's some wariness
about us being here,

41:20.061 --> 41:23.189
but I think we have a good plan
on how to handle Russia.

41:24.232 --> 41:27.318
Would you like to join us?
Raymond can lay it out for you.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.820
Well, I don't know what I can offer.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.198
Well, we're going
to catch some flack

41:32.282 --> 41:35.035
if word gets out that I'm back in business
with the White House.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.995
You could help us smooth that over.

41:37.078 --> 41:40.706
Your press conference was very moving.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.378
- I'm sorry about Frank.
- Thank you.

41:45.461 --> 41:49.174
Of course, he'd have a conniption fit
if he knew I were in the Oval Office.

41:49.257 --> 41:51.259
[laughs]

41:51.342 --> 41:54.720
[chuckles] Well, he is a pragmatist,
Raymond. Whatever works.

41:55.388 --> 41:57.348
- [Blythe] Shall we continue?
- Remy.

41:58.141 --> 42:00.393
[Remy] So, the plan is
to propose a partnership

42:00.476 --> 42:03.104
between American and Chinese
energy companies.

42:29.464 --> 42:32.883
- [Jackie] You seem nervous.
- It's been a while.

42:37.305 --> 42:40.350
- [men conversing indistinctly]
- [automated voice] <i>Going down.</i>

42:56.116 --> 42:57.950
- [EKG machine beeping]
- [scoffs]

42:59.369 --> 43:00.995
[softly] What should I do, boss?

43:25.103 --> 43:26.521
Dr. Saxon.

43:31.817 --> 43:34.820
- I'd like to donate.
- Mr. Stamper--

43:34.904 --> 43:38.491
My blood type is O.
I'm healthy. Let's do the tests.

43:38.574 --> 43:41.577
That's not the only criteria for donation.

43:41.661 --> 43:43.704
You're a recovering alcoholic.
We don't accept--

43:43.788 --> 43:46.832
I don't care about the rules.
If I'm a match, I want you to do it.

43:46.916 --> 43:49.585
Even if you were, it wouldn't matter.

43:49.669 --> 43:51.962
He's too ill
for a partial liver at this point.

43:52.046 --> 43:53.256
He needs a full one.

43:54.174 --> 43:58.052
I'm sorry,
but we'll just have to wait and hope.

44:03.474 --> 44:04.975
- [EKG beeping]
- [metal scraping]

44:12.192 --> 44:13.651
[clacking]

44:15.153 --> 44:17.947
[metal scraping and ringing]

44:21.659 --> 44:23.619
[rifle clacking]

44:52.523 --> 44:53.816
[gunshots]

44:53.899 --> 44:55.401
[EKG machine beeping]

44:55.485 --> 44:57.820
