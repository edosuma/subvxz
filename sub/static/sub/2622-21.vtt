WEBVTT

00:03.795 --> 00:06.547
It seems like all of a sudden,
so much is happening.

00:06.923 --> 00:09.174
I know.
Ross is getting married.

00:09.384 --> 00:12.261
Phoebe's making people.

00:12.762 --> 00:15.264
- Everybody's doing stuff.
- We just sit here.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.975
If I died, the only way
people would know I was here...

00:18.184 --> 00:20.686
...would be by the ass print
on this chair.

00:22.230 --> 00:25.024
Look, we have to do something.
Okay? Something huge.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.027
We could climb Mount Everest.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.739
No, no. Not something stupid.
Something huge.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.199
No, no, no.
I saw an ad for this video.

00:34.409 --> 00:37.077
People climb that thing every day.
We could totally do that.

00:37.871 --> 00:41.081
Why not?
I mean, it's just climbing.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.833
It's just steep.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.043
Yeah.

00:44.669 --> 00:48.255
We're going to Everest. Okay?
It'd be nice to leave an ass print on Everest.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.466
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.718
- What's up?
- We're gonna climb Mount Everest.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.553
- Yeah, baby.
- Really?

00:54.888 --> 00:56.513
I looked into that.

00:56.765 --> 01:02.186
Yeah, but, I mean, it costs like $60,000,
and, you know, you could die. And...

01:02.395 --> 01:04.188
And you would die.

01:05.355 --> 01:07.191
Oh, well.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.735
We could get that Everest video.

01:10.445 --> 01:13.530
Yeah, we could do that without,
you know, risking our lives at all.

01:14.407 --> 01:17.409
While we're down at the video store,
we could rent Die Hard.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.538
Oh. You know what?
I just remembered.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.666
That Everest thing is only available
through mail order.

01:24.834 --> 01:25.918
Oh, well.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.420
So you guys will stay here
and hang out with me?

01:28.588 --> 01:30.547
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.675
But I'll tell you, one of these days...

01:33.885 --> 01:37.096
...we're gonna get off our butts
and rent Die Hard again.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.889
Yeah, we are.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.817
So, what did we decide?
Does your uncle Nathan get an invite or not?

02:32.026 --> 02:34.027
Oh, God.
Nobody likes him.

02:34.237 --> 02:38.323
And he's so cheap. He'd never fly
to London in a million years.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.700
Yeah, invite him.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.537
Hey, did I do these neat enough?

02:44.873 --> 02:46.707
- Yeah, they're fine.
- Yeah?

02:47.167 --> 02:49.543
If anyone asks,
we'll say that Ben addressed them.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.088
Oh. So you invited Rachel then?

02:53.756 --> 02:54.840
Sure, why not?

02:55.216 --> 02:56.717
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:56.885 --> 03:01.555
Well, I don't think I'd be comfortable
having any of my old lovers there.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.808
Wait, wait, wait.
Do you think we shouldn't invite her?

03:05.018 --> 03:07.811
Oh, no, no, Ross,
you know I absolutely adore Rachel.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.857
It's just that, well, I thought
it might be a bit awkward for you.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.526
But it's absolutely your decision.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.445
- More tea?
- Yeah, sure.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.073
- Earl Grey?
- Huh?

03:20.283 --> 03:22.159
Fine, yeah,
invite whoever you want.

03:27.207 --> 03:32.336
I don't want to be single, okay?
I just want to be married again.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.635
And I just want a million dollars.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.179
Rachel?

03:42.388 --> 03:45.390
- Oh, God, Monica. Hi. Thank God.
- Hi.

03:47.310 --> 03:50.896
Okay. Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

03:51.105 --> 03:53.857
This is everybody.
This is Chandler and Phoebe...

03:54.067 --> 03:55.150
...and Joey.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.194
- Do you remember my brother, Ross?
- Sure.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.488
- Hey. Oh, God.
- Hi.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.075
You know, back in high school...

04:03.284 --> 04:06.703
...I had a, um, major crush on you.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.499
- I knew.
- You did? Oh, okay.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.544
I always figured you just thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.380
- I did.
- Oh.

04:19.007 --> 04:20.759
Listen, do you think...?

04:21.010 --> 04:24.554
And try not to let my intense
vulnerability become a factor here.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.518
Do you think it would be okay
if I asked you out sometime maybe?

04:30.270 --> 04:31.561
Yeah.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.772
Maybe.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.108
Okay.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.235
Okay, maybe I will.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.531
See, I see, uh...

04:42.782 --> 04:44.992
...big passion in your future.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.994
- Really?
- I do.

04:47.203 --> 04:50.914
Oh, Ross, you're so great.
Aw...

05:00.425 --> 05:02.467
It's never gonna happen.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.179
Okay, I have a question.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.767
Well, uh, actually,
it's not so much a question...

05:10.977 --> 05:13.478
...as more of a general wondering...

05:14.314 --> 05:16.106
...ment.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.899
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:19.319 --> 05:23.905
Um, well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to, um...

05:24.115 --> 05:26.491
- Oh...
- Yes. Yes. That's...

05:26.701 --> 05:29.036
- Look at that little kitty.
- That's right.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.954
- What?
- That little kitty.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.459
Top of the world looking

05:35.668 --> 05:37.252
Down on creation

05:37.462 --> 05:42.924
And the only explanation I can find

05:43.134 --> 05:48.055
Listen, missy, if you want this cart,
you're gonna have to take me with it.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.143
Yes.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.228
- Did you see that?
- You were incredible.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.023
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:58.232 --> 06:00.650
Thank you. I could not
have done this without you.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.242
Okay, um... Uh...

06:09.452 --> 06:11.036
More clothes in the dryer?

06:11.245 --> 06:13.205
- Oh.
- Oh!

06:13.581 --> 06:14.664
I'm fine. I'm fine.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.542
You had no right to tell me
you ever had feelings for me.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.878
- What?
- I was doing great with Julie...

06:20.046 --> 06:21.463
...before I found out about you.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.757
I was doing great
before I found out about you.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.176
You think it's easy for me
to see you with Julie?

06:26.386 --> 06:29.221
Well, the point is
I don't need this right now.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.139
Okay? It's too late.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.309
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy. This ship has sailed.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.978
All right, fine.
Go ahead and do that, all right, Ross?

06:37.188 --> 06:38.522
I don't need your stupid ship.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.524
- Good.
- Good.

06:43.486 --> 06:44.778
Oh!

07:02.839 --> 07:04.005
Oh.

07:28.197 --> 07:32.284
Do you realize this is the first time
I'm doing something I care about?

07:32.452 --> 07:35.537
This is the first time I'm doing
something I'm actually good at.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.164
If you don't get that...

07:37.373 --> 07:39.958
I get that. I get that bigtime.
And I'm happy for you...

07:40.126 --> 07:42.502
...but I'm tired of having a relationship
with your answering machine.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.297
- I don't know what to do anymore.
- Well, neither do I.

07:45.798 --> 07:46.965
Is this about Mark?

07:49.051 --> 07:50.719
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, it's not.

07:50.928 --> 07:52.262
Oh, my God.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.724
I cannot keep having this same fight
over and over again, Ross.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.643
No. You're making this too hard.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.979
I'm making this too hard?
What do you want me to do?

08:01.189 --> 08:05.108
I don't know. I don't know.
Look, maybe we should just take a break.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.278
You're right. Let's take a break.
Let's cool off, okay?

08:08.529 --> 08:11.156
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

08:11.657 --> 08:12.908
No.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.660
A break from us.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.252
- Do I know why we're rushing?
- You know the girlfriend I told you about?

08:24.462 --> 08:27.380
It turns out that she, uh, wants
to get back together with me.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.632
Oh, I found it!

08:28.841 --> 08:30.967
- That's so great for you guys.
- Yeah.

08:32.094 --> 08:35.388
- Good luck with your girlfriend.
- Oh, thank you... Ah, hey.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.811
Rachel!

08:42.355 --> 08:43.980
Hi. Oh...

08:44.190 --> 08:47.192
- You got my message?
- You are right on time.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.861
So, what do you say?
Can I be your girlfriend again?

08:50.071 --> 08:51.613
Yes, you can very much.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.032
Ah!

08:55.451 --> 08:57.327
- I want you to leave. Get out.
- No. No.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.371
I wanna stay.
I wanna talk about this.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.873
All right. How was she?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.291
Oh-oh.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.005
- What?
- Was she good?

09:09.215 --> 09:10.257
Don't answer that.

09:12.426 --> 09:16.012
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Let's talk about it. How was she?

09:17.223 --> 09:18.265
She was...

09:18.474 --> 09:20.183
- Awful.
- She was not good, not good.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.143
Nothing compared to you.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.020
She was different.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.605
- Ooh!
- Oh-oh.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.733
Good different?

09:30.236 --> 09:32.070
Nobody likes change.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.364
Oh! Just stop.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.951
The way you owned up to everything...

09:38.202 --> 09:42.539
...it just showed me how much
you've grown, you know?

09:42.999 --> 09:46.334
I mean, my mom never thought
this would work out.

09:47.753 --> 09:51.256
She was all,
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

09:52.466 --> 09:53.508
Mm-hm.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.051
Oh...

09:55.261 --> 09:58.680
I just wish we hadn't lost
those four months.

09:58.931 --> 10:03.685
But if time was what you needed
just to gain a little perspective...

10:06.314 --> 10:09.524
We were on a break!

10:20.328 --> 10:21.870
You seem to really like her.

10:22.079 --> 10:25.832
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?
We agreed it was gonna be a two-week thing.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.792
You know? No commitment.

10:28.002 --> 10:33.131
Ross, that girl just spent
the entire evening talking to your friends...

10:33.382 --> 10:35.800
...asking to hear stories about you...

10:36.052 --> 10:38.678
...looking through Monica's photo albums.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.973
I mean, you don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.267
You think? Heh.

10:44.477 --> 10:48.563
You've got like 14 hours
until she has to be at the airport.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.107
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...

10:51.317 --> 10:54.653
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.283
- Yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.047
Oh, this is so amazing.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.966
I can't believe my brother's
getting married, and in London.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.219
It's so romantic.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.555
Hey, pretty smart.

11:22.765 --> 11:23.848
Tissue paper.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.518
You're at the wedding.
You have to cry.

11:26.727 --> 11:29.145
Handkerchief?
No, I got my invitation.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.108
Oh, look, isn't this adorable?

11:33.317 --> 11:36.111
Ross let Ben address mine.

11:36.862 --> 11:37.987
- Hello.
- Hey.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.197
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.950
Hey, did you get your invitation
to Ross' wedding?

11:42.576 --> 11:44.077
No.

11:44.870 --> 11:48.206
Don't worry, man, I get to bring a guest.
We'll show him.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.375
I'm so jealous you're all going.

11:50.584 --> 11:53.753
I can't believe I never knew
you can't fly in your third trimester.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.213
- I never knew that.
- I didn't, either.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.965
I knew that.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.218
So didn't know that.
But you should see your faces.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.055
- Hi, guys. What's up?
- Hey.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.932
We're hanging out.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.274
What's this?
Is this Ross' wedding invitation?

12:14.984 --> 12:18.027
Maybe that's the one
we should have actually hidden.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.865
Oh, no. No, you guys, come on.
You don't have to do that.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.908
I'm happy for him.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.828
I am. I really... I'm... I'm ha...

12:27.037 --> 12:28.663
I'll work on it.

12:29.623 --> 12:30.665
I'm sorry, honey.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.917
Mm.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.628
Rach, you're going to come though,
aren't you?

12:35.796 --> 12:38.423
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...

12:38.841 --> 12:42.260
This isn't one of those
"If she doesn't come, we don't come"?

12:42.511 --> 12:45.054
Because I already bought my ticket...

12:47.850 --> 12:51.352
You know what would be real weird?
If you weren't there.

12:52.271 --> 12:56.357
- Just say you'll think about it, okay?
- No, I'll think about it. Yeah.

12:59.361 --> 13:01.279
- Who's this from?
- That's Ross'.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.530
Oh.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.329
Oh, my God.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.664
He remembered.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.082
Remembered what?

13:13.584 --> 13:17.295
It was like months ago.
We were walking by this antique store.

13:17.546 --> 13:21.049
I saw this pin, and I told him
it was just like one my grandmother had...

13:21.300 --> 13:23.635
...when I was a little girl. Oh.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.137
I can't believe he remembered.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.806
This must have cost him a fortune.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.182
I can't believe he did this.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.101
Remember back in college
when he fell in love with Carol...

13:32.311 --> 13:35.396
...and bought her
that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?

13:36.607 --> 13:37.690
What did you just say?

13:49.328 --> 13:51.913
Oh, my God.

13:52.456 --> 13:55.291
Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.547
Oh, my God.

14:00.756 --> 14:03.967
- We were in school together.
- We haven't seen each other since then.

14:04.176 --> 14:07.595
Well, I land in China.
Guess who's in charge of the dig?

14:07.805 --> 14:08.972
Julie!

14:10.599 --> 14:12.016
Julie! Isn't that great?

14:12.601 --> 14:17.188
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

14:19.191 --> 14:22.318
Oh, that is so sweet.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.572
No... Heh.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.782
No... Okay.
No, you hang up.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.952
No, you...
Okay. Okay.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.997
One, two, three.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.500
You didn't hang up either.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.003
- She didn't hang up.
- She didn't hang up either.

14:43.799 --> 14:44.883
Okay, no.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.301
No, you hang up.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.012
You. You. Y...

14:53.475 --> 14:55.143
Ross, hi.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.145
It's Rachel.

14:57.354 --> 15:01.190
I'm just calling to say
that, um, everything's fine.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.651
And I'm really happy for you...

15:04.111 --> 15:06.070
...and your cat.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.784
So obviously, I am over you.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.121
I am over you.

15:15.289 --> 15:20.376
And that, my friend,
is what they call closure.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.923
Rach, I got a message from you.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.592
Oh, my God, no.
Hang up the phone. Give me the phone.

15:27.760 --> 15:32.138
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
Give me the phone!

15:37.853 --> 15:39.729
You're over me?

15:39.980 --> 15:41.731
Oh, God.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.150
- What...? You're, uh?
- Oh, God.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.443
You're over me?

15:47.321 --> 15:50.323
- Oh, my God.
- When were you...

15:50.574 --> 15:52.200
...under me?

15:55.329 --> 15:56.621
Basically, ahem...

15:56.872 --> 15:59.123
...lately, I've, uh...

16:00.417 --> 16:03.461
Ahem. I've sort of had feelings for you.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.672
Okay, I need to lie down.

16:07.549 --> 16:08.675
He broke up with Julie.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.262
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.975
- Really?
- Really.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.144
It's always been you, Rach.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.105
Oh, God.

16:27.528 --> 16:28.820
Oh...

16:30.614 --> 16:32.949
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.368
Oh, that's okay.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.371
- You're worth the wait.
- Oh.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.790
And I don't just mean tonight.

16:42.876 --> 16:48.297
I never dreamed
That I'd meet somebody like you

16:51.218 --> 16:54.762
I never dreamed
That I'd lose somebody like you

16:59.309 --> 17:05.397
No, I don't want to fall in love

17:07.608 --> 17:08.984
Oh, God!

17:09.194 --> 17:11.445
Oh. Honey.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.239
Oh, that's okay.

17:14.324 --> 17:17.242
Oh, no, you just rolled over
the juice box.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.249
Gunther, please tell me
you didn't say anything to Rachel...

17:23.416 --> 17:25.501
...about me and the girl
from the copy place.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.420
I'm sorry.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.589
Was I not supposed to?

17:36.513 --> 17:38.097
You're the one who ended it.

17:38.307 --> 17:42.310
Yeah, because I was mad at you.
Not because I stopped loving you.

17:43.604 --> 17:44.645
You still love me?

17:45.105 --> 17:46.522
No.

17:48.025 --> 17:52.445
What does this mean? What do you...?
I mean, do you want to get back together?

17:52.654 --> 17:55.156
No. Maybe.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.617
- I don't... I don't know.
- What?

17:58.994 --> 18:00.870
I just... I feel...

18:09.755 --> 18:14.383
I can't believe I even thought of getting back
together with you. We are so over.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.512
Fine by me!

18:19.306 --> 18:22.725
And, hey, just so you know,
it's not that common...

18:22.893 --> 18:26.604
...it doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal!

18:27.648 --> 18:29.440
I knew it!

18:40.494 --> 18:44.038
Rachel's coming up.
Doesn't she look pretty, Jack?

18:45.374 --> 18:46.833
Oh, my God.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.752
- This is us getting ready for the prom.
- Oh!

18:49.962 --> 18:52.004
You know what?
We don't have to watch this.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.714
- Yeah, we do.
- Come on.

18:53.882 --> 18:54.924
Fun.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.300
Get a shot of Monica.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.177
Wait, how do you zoom out?

18:58.387 --> 19:00.513
There she is.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.809
Shut up.
The camera adds 10 pounds.

19:05.018 --> 19:07.687
Huh, so how many cameras
are actually on you?

19:08.939 --> 19:10.690
Dad, turn it off.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.191
- It is off.
- Yeah.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.943
Right, Ross?

19:18.615 --> 19:20.783
Looking good, Mr. Kotter.

19:23.120 --> 19:27.123
I can't go to my own prom without a date.
I can't. It's too late.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.626
If you're not going,
then I don't wanna go either.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.837
I have a wonderful idea.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.298
You should take Rachel to the prom.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.258
We've seen enough.
Let's turn it off.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.553
- I want to see.
- Fine, I'm not going to watch, all right?

19:40.762 --> 19:41.846
Come on, kid. Let's go.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.765
Are you handsome.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.601
Let's show them.

19:50.772 --> 19:53.316
- Okay, Dad.
- Rachel, ready or not.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.651
Here comes your knight in shining...

19:55.819 --> 19:56.944
Oh, no.

19:57.112 --> 20:01.908
- Bye. Don't wait up.
- Okay, Chip, let's go.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.827
Oh, dear.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.662
Jack, how do I turn this off?

20:08.999 --> 20:11.042
I can't believe you did that.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.586
Yeah, well...

20:31.146 --> 20:33.439
See? He's her lobster.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.159
No.

20:45.369 --> 20:48.162
- You're really not going?
- Yeah.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.748
It's just going to be too hard.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.376
You know, I mean...

20:53.627 --> 20:55.419
...it's Ross.

20:56.129 --> 20:58.714
How can I watch him get married?

21:00.092 --> 21:03.302
You know?
It's just for the best, you know? It is.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.305
Plus somebody's
got to stay here with Phoebe.

21:06.556 --> 21:09.308
She's going to be pretty big by then...

21:09.559 --> 21:12.520
...and she'll need someone
to help her tie her shoes.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.940
Drive her to the hospital
in case she goes into labor.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.484
You don't have a car.

21:18.735 --> 21:21.153
- And your license expired.
- I know.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.616
Yeah. See, there's so much to do,
and I have so little time to do it in.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.457
Check this out.

21:33.667 --> 21:37.128
It says there's a place you can go
to rent videos of all the museums.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.214
"It's almost as good as being there."

21:40.424 --> 21:44.135
It's better. You can't go to a museum
in your underwear.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.555
Well, you could,
but probably just the one time.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.809
I bet we could get videos
of all the sights...

21:52.019 --> 21:55.604
...get a VCR in our hotel room,
we'd never even have to go outside.

21:56.189 --> 21:58.190
If we do that,
we've got to rent Die Hard.

22:00.027 --> 22:03.070
Oh-ho, I bet the British version is good.
