WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:02.435
Previously on "The Practice"...

00:02.468 --> 00:05.305
We stipulated to
strangulation as
the cause of death.

00:05.338 --> 00:06.439
I'm not authorizing--
Can I finish?

00:06.471 --> 00:07.541
You don't need to finish.

00:07.574 --> 00:09.109
We already know
what you're gonna say.

00:09.142 --> 00:10.811
You got a sick, depraved,
murdering client,

00:10.844 --> 00:12.679
like always,
and like always,

00:12.713 --> 00:14.480
the more truth you can
keep under wraps, the better.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.382
Napoleon complex,
your honor.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.151
Res ipsapipsqueak.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.285
JUDGE: All right!

00:19.319 --> 00:20.621
You are a killer.
You know that?

00:20.654 --> 00:21.655
An icy killer.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.090
Thank you, Richard.
It's a compliment, I take it?

00:24.124 --> 00:26.159
Of course it was.
Your style's the same as mine.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.728
I'm in love with you.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.730
I'm sorry,
I should say infatuated.

00:29.763 --> 00:32.265
I mean, you're smart,
you're sexy,

00:32.298 --> 00:34.400
you got that little
Catholic girl thing,

00:34.434 --> 00:36.770
and I totally go for it,
the whole package.

00:36.803 --> 00:38.371
Richard, we're in the middle
of a trial here.

00:38.404 --> 00:40.574
I speak my mind.
Yes, well,
I'm speaking mine.

00:40.607 --> 00:42.108
Let's stick to business.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.177
Police, freeze!
Aah!

00:44.678 --> 00:45.579
Roberta!

00:45.612 --> 00:46.680
Judge Kittleson?

00:46.713 --> 00:48.448
Get out, all of you!

00:49.182 --> 00:51.785
I didn't know you and
I were speaking romantically,

00:51.818 --> 00:52.753
much less --

00:52.786 --> 00:55.155
I find it difficult
to tell a man I miss him.

00:55.188 --> 00:56.857
For whatever reason,
It's just easier

00:56.890 --> 01:00.160
to show up
in his apartment naked.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.396
BOBBY: How long do you think?

01:03.429 --> 01:04.831
ELLENOR: Three, four days tops.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.232
There aren't
many witnesses.

01:06.266 --> 01:07.400
BOBBY: Louise gonna testify?

01:07.433 --> 01:08.702
Well, she has to.

01:08.735 --> 01:09.870
It's her word
against her husband's.

01:09.903 --> 01:10.771
If I don't put her up...

01:10.804 --> 01:11.838
(door opens)

01:16.376 --> 01:17.644
What? People don't
greet people here

01:17.678 --> 01:18.712
when they come
through the door?

01:19.846 --> 01:21.748
What do you want?
How's that?

01:23.650 --> 01:24.718
Ellenor...

01:26.653 --> 01:28.589
our complaining witness
isn't doing well.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.256
He's at Mass General,
status one,

01:30.290 --> 01:31.091
awaiting a donor heart.

01:31.124 --> 01:32.859
Evidently the doctors
don't expect his

01:32.893 --> 01:33.894
to hold out much longer.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.563
What I'd like is to take
his videotape depo there.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.465
We can introduce it at trial.
I'm assuming you'll agree.

01:39.499 --> 01:40.767
You got that wrong.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.203
I beg your pardon?
If you can't get your

01:43.236 --> 01:45.238
witness to trial, Richard,
that's not our problem.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.641
The man is on his deathbed.
For which I sympathize,

01:47.674 --> 01:50.911
but the man is also
the chief prosecutorial witness,
and you can't expect us

01:50.944 --> 01:52.913
to make it easier for him
to put our client away.

01:52.946 --> 01:56.482
I'm expecting you to have
the decency to accommodate --
We're not that decent.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.719
RICHARD: I'll go to court,
get an order from the judge.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.486
ELLENOR: Do that,
but I'm not about

02:00.521 --> 02:02.488
to facilitate an attempted
murder conviction.

02:02.523 --> 02:05.458
I'm only talking
about a humane way
of getting the testimony.

02:05.491 --> 02:07.894
This does nothing
to my burden --
EUGENE: We won't agree.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.363
Get an order if you want,
but like Ellenor says,

02:10.395 --> 02:12.232
we aren't about
to make things easy.

02:20.440 --> 02:24.377
How stupid of me
to expect you people
to be decent or humane.

02:24.410 --> 02:25.378
You think you're heroes,

02:25.411 --> 02:27.681
playing a part in the
criminal justice system,

02:27.714 --> 02:29.616
the crusaders
against oppression.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.384
Well, you might
have started out that way,

02:31.417 --> 02:32.485
but look at you now.

02:32.519 --> 02:34.688
The day-to-day stench
of your clients has rubbed off.

02:34.721 --> 02:37.390
You're every bit as vile
and contaminated

02:37.423 --> 02:39.526
as the murderers and rapists
you defend.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.663
You bring no dignity to law.
You proffer disgrace.

02:42.696 --> 02:43.930
Where you might once
have been noble,

02:43.964 --> 02:46.600
you've sunk into a sinkhole
of disrepute

02:46.633 --> 02:48.969
where your only idealism
is "Get the guy off,"

02:49.002 --> 02:50.704
even when it offends
human nature

02:50.737 --> 02:52.573
or it insults morality.

02:52.606 --> 02:56.242
You're so lost in the inferno
of crime and dishonor,

02:56.276 --> 02:58.244
you've become sickening animals,

02:58.278 --> 03:00.446
repugnant to everything
that's good about this country,

03:00.480 --> 03:02.649
everything
this nation celebrates

03:02.683 --> 03:04.250
in the spirit of humanity.

03:04.284 --> 03:06.820
You are sick,
awful vehicles of hate.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.222
If there is a God,
he will get you,

03:09.255 --> 03:11.558
you sleazy,
cancerous-infected,

03:11.592 --> 03:13.960
malignant, grotesque snakes!

03:19.633 --> 03:22.636
(theme music playing)

04:06.513 --> 04:07.614
You're going to die
an early death

04:07.648 --> 04:09.916
if you don't calm down.
They get to me.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.785
They're defense attorneys.
They have a duty --

04:11.818 --> 04:13.453
The man is
on his deathbed, Helen.

04:13.486 --> 04:15.822
They can't agree to take
his testimony in a hospital?

04:15.856 --> 04:18.524
They're disgusting,
despicable, dirty roaches...

04:18.559 --> 04:20.060
Richard --
and they get to me.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.428
Look, just go to court
and get the order.

04:22.462 --> 04:23.363
Who's the judge?

04:23.830 --> 04:25.298
Kittleson.
I hate her, too.

04:25.331 --> 04:26.299
And why is that?

04:26.332 --> 04:30.571
Because Raymond Oz
called me a midget at Sidebar.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.072
She could have held him
in contempt.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.940
He was the defendant.
She couldn't very well --

04:33.974 --> 04:36.610
Then she half-called me
a midget, too.
Kittleson?

04:36.643 --> 04:38.011
It was a slip.

04:38.044 --> 04:40.380
She said "midge,"
then caught herself.

04:40.413 --> 04:41.582
I hate her, too.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.049
Richard, you're about
ready to start

04:43.083 --> 04:44.050
an attempted murder trial.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.653
If you go in there
hating the defense attorneys,

04:46.687 --> 04:47.954
hating the judge,
you're going to end up

04:47.988 --> 04:49.556
being defeated
by your own anger.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.825
Now, go to court,

04:51.858 --> 04:54.060
get the order
to do the video depo,

04:54.094 --> 04:55.629
and take it from there.

05:02.669 --> 05:04.905
I really appreciate you
taking the time, Jimmy.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.607
No problem.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.575
You look great,
by the way.

05:08.609 --> 05:09.810
Did I say that already?

05:09.843 --> 05:10.844
Twice.

05:11.712 --> 05:15.048
And your husband --
How's he?

05:15.081 --> 05:17.383
Gone. We divorced
three years ago.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.686
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.987
You said you were sorry
to hear

05:21.021 --> 05:22.689
we were getting married.
Now you're sorry he's gone?

05:22.723 --> 05:25.692
I was just talking
as an old boyfriend back then.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.529
I mean, if you're not sorry
he's gone, then neither am I.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.730
Okay.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.398
So, what's up?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.702
Well, um...

05:35.736 --> 05:38.371
this is a little
embarrassing, but, um...

05:38.404 --> 05:39.840
You can tell me.

05:40.607 --> 05:41.742
Okay.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.977
I sold my eggs
to this man --

05:44.010 --> 05:45.912
for $9,000.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.081
What do you mean,
you sold your eggs?

05:48.114 --> 05:50.150
My eggs --
for reproduction.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.686
I have a web site,
and I sell my eggs.

05:52.719 --> 05:53.920
I have back orders.
You wouldn't believe

05:53.954 --> 05:55.421
how many men are looking
to have children,

05:55.455 --> 05:56.890
not wanting to wait
for wives.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.525
Wait a second.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.794
You sell your eggs,

06:00.827 --> 06:03.697
and they, like,
fertilize them?

06:03.730 --> 06:04.865
Yes.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.971
Men donate to sperm banks
all the time.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.105
It's the same thing.

06:12.138 --> 06:14.608
But you do it for money.

06:14.641 --> 06:17.410
Yes, and this one customer,
I trusted him.

06:17.443 --> 06:18.912
I usually demand payment
in advance,

06:18.945 --> 06:20.514
but this one customer
I didn't,

06:20.547 --> 06:23.049
and he hasn't paid,
so I sued.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.985
But now, as we're about
to go into court,

06:25.018 --> 06:26.587
there's some motion
to dismiss,

06:26.620 --> 06:28.488
and my lawyer dropped me.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.491
He said for $9,000,
it wasn't worth it.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.895
The hearing's at 11:00.
I'm really in a bind.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.699
You sold your eggs.

06:39.199 --> 06:42.936
(traffic sound)

06:42.969 --> 06:45.539
If he's not ready for trial,
I'll agree to a continuance.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.673
Oh, how generous,

06:46.707 --> 06:48.509
in which case my witness
will be dead

06:48.542 --> 06:49.409
and I'll have no case.

06:49.442 --> 06:50.944
Hey, why don't we continue
for 10 years?

06:50.977 --> 06:52.012
Would that be safe?

06:52.045 --> 06:54.748
Mr. Bay, getting snide
doesn't really serve anything.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.183
She wants continuance
as in stall, judge.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.786
Quiet. What exactly
is the problem

06:59.820 --> 07:01.221
with the videotaped
deposition?

07:01.254 --> 07:02.789
It will prejudice
our case.

07:02.823 --> 07:03.657
JUDGE: How so?

07:03.690 --> 07:04.758
Your honor,
if I have to

07:04.791 --> 07:06.727
cross-examine a man
in a hospital bed,

07:06.760 --> 07:08.562
I will come off
so unsympathetic.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.097
ELLENOR: I will alienate the
jury. It will be irreparable.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.498
I'll look like a monster.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.499
You are a monster.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.167
Hey, look!

07:14.200 --> 07:15.669
Mr. Bay!

07:16.870 --> 07:18.238
So, what's the alternative?

07:18.271 --> 07:20.607
If we haul him in here,
he could die.

07:20.641 --> 07:21.575
ELLENOR: All I can say

07:21.608 --> 07:23.610
is that my client is
entitled to a fair trial,

07:23.644 --> 07:25.178
and she will be denied that

07:25.211 --> 07:26.913
if the chief
prosecutorial witness

07:26.947 --> 07:29.082
has to give testimony
from a hospital bed,

07:29.115 --> 07:30.684
leaving me hamstrung.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.185
I'm going to grant
the prosecution's request.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.987
Your honor --
JUDGE: Save it, counsel.

07:34.020 --> 07:36.056
Your client tried
to run the man over.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.759
That is partly the reason
he's in that hospital bed.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.727
Untrue -- preexisting
heart condition.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.928
Brought on by stress,

07:41.962 --> 07:43.564
which your client didn't help

07:43.597 --> 07:46.867
by charging him
with a sport utility vehicle.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.870
JUDGE: Now, since the jury
is already impaneled,

07:49.903 --> 07:52.105
let's do this at noon.
I will referee.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.707
Thank you, your honor.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.177
It doesn't really
delay the trial.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.178
It just means
that part of it

07:58.211 --> 07:59.813
will happen
in the hospital.

07:59.846 --> 08:02.082
This can't wait
till he's better?

08:02.115 --> 08:05.018
Well, the likelihood is
he's not going to get better,

08:05.051 --> 08:06.587
not unless a donor heart
comes in,

08:06.620 --> 08:09.823
and even then, because
of some other complications,

08:09.856 --> 08:12.626
he may not be deemed
a suitable candidate.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.994
Gee, if I'd had known
he was that sick,

08:14.027 --> 08:15.996
I never would have had
to run him over.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.167
It's a joke.

08:21.201 --> 08:24.738
Yeah, well, we should
get to the hospital.

08:24.771 --> 08:25.872
Assuming we finish,

08:25.906 --> 08:27.608
the trial will begin
this afternoon.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.142
Okay.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.878
A contract's a contract.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.847
First of all, there is
an implied covenant

08:33.880 --> 08:35.582
that the egg,
once fertilized,

08:35.616 --> 08:36.582
will become an embryo.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.118
There is no such
implied covenant.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.587
Second, this contract
is against public policy.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.121
For a woman
to be selling her eggs,

08:42.155 --> 08:43.990
it is so unethical.
JIMMY: Well your
client bought them.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.258
I am not defending that.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.126
But he took them,

08:46.159 --> 08:48.695
entered into a contract
to pay for them,

08:48.729 --> 08:49.930
and now he's not paying.

08:49.963 --> 08:50.931
JIMMY: How ethical is that?

08:50.964 --> 08:53.166
Your honor, this is
an unenforceable contract.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.167
Then make restitution.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.870
My client would give back
the eggs if he could.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.805
He realizes now how immoral

08:58.839 --> 09:00.607
this type
of transaction is.

09:00.641 --> 09:01.842
To pay money
in consideration

09:01.875 --> 09:03.810
would only serve
to ratify the immorality.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.680
Who are you kidding?
Your honor, they made a deal.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.914
I understand that,
Mr. Berluti,

09:07.948 --> 09:10.016
but the court
is not in the habit

09:10.050 --> 09:12.786
of enforcing contracts
that go against public policy.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.087
Again, restitution.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.322
You're not looking
for restitution, counselor.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.824
You're looking
for consideration,

09:17.858 --> 09:20.293
and that begs the question
of enforceability.

09:20.326 --> 09:24.765
And frankly, I have problems
upholding this kind of deal.

09:24.798 --> 09:25.498
Your honor --

09:25.532 --> 09:29.202
I'll hear oral arguments
at 2:00,

09:29.235 --> 09:32.706
although since we're
just talking about $9,000,

09:32.739 --> 09:36.142
my suggestion
is you people work this out.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.245
We'll give you $1,500.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.380
We'll take $6,000.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.915
$6,000?
No way.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.717
I didn't even get
an embryo out of it.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.686
That wasn't in the contract,
Mr. Emerson.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.253
I'll offer $1,500
and no more.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.189
Anything else, I'd just as soon
come back to court.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.924
Then we go back
to court.
Susan --

09:50.957 --> 09:52.959
No, Jimmy, it's principle.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.628
I'm glad there
were no pregnancies,

09:54.661 --> 09:56.997
I'd hate to
think of my offspring
being raised by you.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.733
Come on, Howard.
Come on.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.338
Can you represent me
one more day, Jimmy?

10:05.906 --> 10:06.940
Susan.

10:13.714 --> 10:17.117
How come you're doing this,
selling your eggs?

10:18.451 --> 10:21.187
It's hard making ends meet,
Jimmy.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.958
My life hasn't exactly
worked out like I planned.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.128
Could you please
stop judging me?

10:28.161 --> 10:29.262
I'm not judging --
You are,

10:29.295 --> 10:30.363
like you used to do.

10:30.396 --> 10:32.398
I never --
You did.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.101
I don't need it now.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.706
Can you help me or not?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.314
MR. MORGAN:
We'd been fighting a lot.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.383
I told her
I wanted a divorce.

10:50.416 --> 10:51.685
What were you
fighting about?

10:51.718 --> 10:52.886
Oh, you name it.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.888
We basically reached the
point...

10:54.921 --> 10:57.323
we didn't like each other.
The marriage was over.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.060
There was nothing left
but hate.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.395
I'd like to turn to
August 10th of this year.

11:02.428 --> 11:03.329
Do you remember that day?

11:03.363 --> 11:06.166
Yes. That was the day
she tried to kill me.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.167
Objection.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.034
Sustained.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.936
What happened on that day,
Mr. Morgan?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.973
Well, we had just got back
from grocery shopping --

11:13.006 --> 11:14.374
which, by the way,
I was a little suspicious.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.276
She never asked me to go
shopping with her before.

11:16.309 --> 11:20.080
But on this day,
she needs me.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.347
And when we got home,

11:21.381 --> 11:24.250
the garage door opener,
it wasn't working.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.887
So, she said I should have to
get out of the car

11:26.920 --> 11:28.454
and open the door.

11:28.488 --> 11:29.489
You offered to do it.

11:29.523 --> 11:32.225
Mrs. Morgan,
you don't speak here.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.894
Continue, sir.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.195
So, I got out of the car,

11:35.228 --> 11:37.798
stepped in front of it
to open the garage door,

11:37.831 --> 11:40.033
I opened the garage door,

11:40.066 --> 11:41.101
and at this point,

11:41.134 --> 11:43.236
she just gunned
the accelerator

11:43.269 --> 11:44.838
and ran me over.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.206
It's a miracle I lived.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.775
God didn't want you.
That's the only reason.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.076
Louise.
Mrs. Morgan.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.812
One second, your honor.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.380
This will be played
for the jury.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.349
They will see and hear
everything you say,

11:56.382 --> 11:58.418
so be quiet.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.986
All right.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.124
Did you see the vehicle
come at you?

12:04.157 --> 12:07.060
Yes, and I saw her face.

12:07.093 --> 12:08.762
Can you describe
her face?

12:08.795 --> 12:11.865
She had a look
of determination.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.299
It was willful.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.401
I could see this
was no stuck accelerator.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.469
She knew what see was doing.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.471
How can you be sure?

12:18.505 --> 12:20.373
I've known her for 35 years.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.342
I can read her face.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.878
She meant to run me over.

12:25.211 --> 12:27.047
Your wife contends
it was an accident.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.281
It was no accident.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.983
She tried to kill me.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.452
I know it as well
as she does.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.294
How sick is this man?

12:41.327 --> 12:43.564
Very. His heart is weak.
His left ventricle --

12:43.597 --> 12:44.464
I'll kill him.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.365
All right.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.299
Your honor,
every defendant

12:46.332 --> 12:48.368
is entitled to confront
his or her accuser.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.436
Gee, I never knew that.
You're such a gift.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.173
My point is if
I cross-examine him tough,

12:53.206 --> 12:55.108
which I'll have to do
after that testimony,

12:55.141 --> 12:55.809
I'll kill him.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.077
You're not that good,
Ellenor.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.311
Would you get back?

12:58.344 --> 12:59.345
If I mistake you
for a gnat,

12:59.379 --> 13:00.380
I might swat.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.082
I want that on record.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.051
Your honor, you have to admit
our hands are a little tied.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.486
The doctor thinks
he's strong enough

13:06.520 --> 13:07.554
to answer your questions.

13:07.588 --> 13:09.322
I am not going
to lob softballs.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.456
This is a murder trial.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.125
You can cross-examine him

13:12.158 --> 13:14.060
without being
overly aggressive.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.262
I shouldn't have to.
My client has rights.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.230
Oh, stop with the lectures.

13:17.263 --> 13:18.364
I have a duty to go hard.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.933
Even if it induces
a coronary,

13:19.966 --> 13:21.001
I have to protect
the interests

13:21.034 --> 13:21.868
of my client.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.203
Sick, grotesque.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.204
Look, I am not trying

13:24.237 --> 13:25.539
to compromise
this man's health,

13:25.572 --> 13:27.608
but I won't compromise
Louise Morgan's, either.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.342
That testimony was damaging.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.144
So, what are you
going to do?
Get away!

13:31.177 --> 13:32.579
Don't you ever push me!

13:32.613 --> 13:35.248
JUDGE: Hey, I've about had it
with all of you!

13:35.281 --> 13:38.118
Knock it off now! Hey!

13:44.958 --> 13:47.994
Can this man withstand
more questioning?

13:48.028 --> 13:50.631
Perhaps, but I don't
want him agitated.
You mean like him?

13:50.664 --> 13:52.498
JUDGE: Eugene.
Oh, funny.

13:52.533 --> 13:53.867
And he needs
to rest first.

13:53.900 --> 13:57.971
Okay, we will resume
back here at 3:00.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.082
What am I going to do?

14:09.115 --> 14:10.383
You got to cross him,
Ellenor.

14:10.416 --> 14:12.118
His health
can't be an issue.

14:12.152 --> 14:15.488
Like you say, we got
to protect Louise.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.357
Great.

14:22.663 --> 14:24.297
Look, maybe I should take over.

14:24.330 --> 14:25.098
I'm fine.

14:25.131 --> 14:26.933
Look, Richard,
if you pushed Eugene,

14:26.967 --> 14:28.969
that tells me you have
some judgment problems.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.571
He'd squish you
like a bug.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.939
I can handle myself.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.474
Why are you personalizing
this so much?

14:34.508 --> 14:36.577
Is it because Bobby
called you a pipsqueak?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.046
They laughed at us
when Raymond Oz went free.

14:40.080 --> 14:40.914
No, they didn't.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.015
They did, Helen.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.349
That old fart
was a murderer,

14:43.383 --> 14:44.317
and they helped him get off.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.419
Now they've got another one,
and they know it.

14:46.452 --> 14:47.921
The woman
mowed down her husband.

14:47.954 --> 14:48.689
Who's kidding who?

14:48.722 --> 14:49.523
They're defense attorneys.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.457
Most of their clients
will be guilty.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.393
There's a difference between
giving every defendant

14:53.426 --> 14:55.662
a zealous defense
and distorting the system.

14:55.696 --> 14:57.197
That's not what the framers
had in mind.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.498
If you start quoting
The constitution
isn't designed

14:58.532 --> 14:59.399
the founding fathers again,
to secure the freedom
of murderers.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.702
I'm going to leave.
You know what I mean.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.304
Ellenor, she'll
cross-examine that guy

15:04.337 --> 15:05.506
into having a heart attack

15:05.539 --> 15:07.440
if a coronary will keep
his testimony out.

15:07.473 --> 15:09.676
She won't blink half an eye.
She'll just do it.

15:09.710 --> 15:10.677
They're not evil people.

15:10.711 --> 15:12.412
Yes, they are.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.649
Richard, for three years
I've been telling you

15:15.682 --> 15:16.349
what would happen

15:16.382 --> 15:18.619
if you personalize
your trials.

15:18.652 --> 15:19.986
What did I say?

15:20.654 --> 15:22.956
I'd lose my hair.

15:22.989 --> 15:24.024
You're a great D. A.,

15:24.057 --> 15:26.092
but you got to keep
an even keel.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.197
Helen,
can I ask you something?

15:31.231 --> 15:32.498
Sure.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.467
Will you have dinner
with me tonight?

15:34.500 --> 15:36.202
Oh, God, no.

15:36.236 --> 15:39.205
Nice. Just forget
I ever lived. Get out.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.609
I didn't mean...

15:43.777 --> 15:45.612
I just meant
I don't ever want to eat

15:45.646 --> 15:47.614
with any fellow D. A.'s.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.683
Never mind.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.654
No. Sure, let's have dinner.
Let's do it.

15:53.687 --> 15:55.455
Don't patronize me, Helen.
I don't like --

15:55.488 --> 15:59.092
Richard, I am saying yes.
You've got a window here.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.763
Federal and State law

16:02.796 --> 16:04.464
prohibit the sale
of any organs --

16:04.497 --> 16:06.066
We're not talking
about organs.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.033
An egg is not --

16:07.067 --> 16:08.635
The same
principle applies.

16:08.669 --> 16:09.670
The law doesn't say that.

16:09.703 --> 16:11.171
But maybe it should.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.640
Just as we prohibit the sale
of livers and organs --

16:13.674 --> 16:14.641
JIMMY: We could do that, judge,

16:14.675 --> 16:16.777
but then you'd have to
cut off the sale of sperm.

16:16.810 --> 16:17.644
That's going on.

16:17.678 --> 16:20.180
I would agree.
We should shut that down.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.783
You know, It's one thing
to donate an egg or semen

16:22.816 --> 16:24.350
out of charity or altruism,

16:24.384 --> 16:26.787
but It's quite another
to do so for profit.

16:26.820 --> 16:30.256
He's in here arguing
what the law should be.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.725
That's not a court's job.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.360
The judge is supposed to rule
on what the law is.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.631
He wants it changed,
let him go to congress.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.800
But what the law says today,

16:39.833 --> 16:43.169
It's okay for a woman
to sell her eggs,

16:43.203 --> 16:47.173
and this distinction
between altruism and profit --

16:47.207 --> 16:50.076
forgive my language,
that's just crap.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.112
Profit saves lives.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.346
The drug companies
aren't out there

16:53.379 --> 16:56.216
developing vaccines
because of altruism.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.318
It's about patents
and profit.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.786
This isn't
about drug vaccines.

16:59.820 --> 17:02.022
It shouldn't be
about hypocrisy, either.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.790
Everything that happens
in business,

17:03.824 --> 17:06.358
and much of the stuff
that goes on in medicine,

17:06.392 --> 17:08.529
It's got to do with money.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.262
So, don't be coming down
on my client

17:10.296 --> 17:12.198
because she's looking
for financial gain.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.367
JIMMY: She's acting
inside the boundaries

17:15.401 --> 17:16.569
of the law.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.304
She made a contract
with that man

17:18.338 --> 17:21.473
inside the boundaries,
he breached it,

17:21.508 --> 17:24.109
and she's come
to a court of law

17:24.144 --> 17:26.479
for the remedy
she's entitled to.

17:29.650 --> 17:31.451
How long before he rules?

17:31.484 --> 17:33.186
Shouldn't take too long.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.822
I'm on beeper,
so as soon as I hear...

17:35.856 --> 17:38.291
Hey, thank you, Jimmy.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.226
I really appreciate it.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.528
Okay.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.367
You don't approve,
do you?

17:48.268 --> 17:52.372
No. I hope it didn't show
in there, but...

17:54.908 --> 17:55.842
I don't think women

17:55.876 --> 17:58.579
should be selling off
their reproductive eggs.

17:58.612 --> 18:01.347
I think it goes against God.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.383
Hmm.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.485
Still religious, huh?

18:05.519 --> 18:10.190
Not too,
but on some things...

18:13.493 --> 18:14.761
You seeing anyone?

18:16.262 --> 18:17.598
Well...

18:17.831 --> 18:20.166
sort of, yeah.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.235
Figures.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.404
Most of the good ones are.

18:24.437 --> 18:28.542
Susan, you and I...

18:28.575 --> 18:31.411
we already crossed
that bridge.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.647
You threw me over.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.417
Well, I was what, 23?

18:37.450 --> 18:39.653
Priorities change.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.188
Are you going
to get married?

18:44.224 --> 18:46.326
It ain't that serious.

18:48.228 --> 18:51.331
Well, don't wait
too long, Jimmy.

18:53.567 --> 18:58.204
Yeah. Listen, I'll call
as soon as I hear.

18:58.238 --> 19:01.875
Okay. Thanks.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.220
You said you were suspicious

19:14.254 --> 19:16.222
when your wife asked you
to go shopping.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.724
Had you never shopped
with her before?

19:17.758 --> 19:19.526
Oh, a few times,
but certainly not enough --

19:19.560 --> 19:20.393
So you had, then.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.295
When you said never,
that was a mistake.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.930
More like an overstatement.

19:23.964 --> 19:26.600
It was just not a usual thing
for me to shop with her.

19:26.633 --> 19:27.634
And when you got home,

19:27.668 --> 19:29.603
you got out of the car
to open up the garage door.

19:29.636 --> 19:30.537
Yes.

19:30.571 --> 19:32.573
And then you moved
in front of the car?
Yes.

19:32.606 --> 19:33.406
And how many feet

19:33.439 --> 19:34.775
in front of the car
were you standing?

19:34.808 --> 19:36.409
3 feet maybe.
3 feet.

19:36.442 --> 19:37.844
And when you opened up
the garage door,

19:37.878 --> 19:39.479
the car suddenly
came at you?

19:39.513 --> 19:40.747
Yes.
Fast or slow?

19:40.781 --> 19:42.215
It just sprang at me.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.416
It lurched forward
and ran me over.

19:43.449 --> 19:44.918
How many seconds did it take
to run you over?

19:44.951 --> 19:46.853
A second,
maybe less.

19:46.887 --> 19:49.289
It just exploded towards me.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.524
She floored it?

19:50.557 --> 19:51.992
Could you see the
floorboard of the car?

19:52.025 --> 19:53.493
Of course not, but the way
that car sprang forward,

19:53.527 --> 19:55.495
she had to have just gunned it.

19:55.529 --> 19:57.564
Knocked you down
in less than a second?
Yes.

19:57.598 --> 19:59.332
Half a second?
May be.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.334
In that half-second,
you saw the car come at you?

20:01.367 --> 20:02.202
Yes.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.504
And in the remainder
of that half-second

20:03.537 --> 20:04.838
when you weren't looking
at the car,

20:04.871 --> 20:06.272
you saw your wife's face?

20:06.306 --> 20:08.008
I saw it good.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.475
For less
than a half a second.

20:09.510 --> 20:11.878
I didn't time it,
but I saw it good.

20:11.912 --> 20:14.447
You said you wanted
to divorce her, right?

20:14.480 --> 20:15.549
Yes.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.751
Didn't have any feelings
for her anymore besides hate,

20:17.784 --> 20:19.586
Wasn't that your testimony?
Pretty much.

20:19.620 --> 20:21.588
And since you've developed
this heart condition,

20:21.622 --> 20:22.689
you've been gifting away

20:22.723 --> 20:24.390
as much of your estate
as possible.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.292
You've even told friends that,
right, Mr. Morgan?

20:26.326 --> 20:27.493
Keep it away
from Uncle Sam.

20:27.528 --> 20:29.663
And your wife.
Didn't you tell some friends

20:29.696 --> 20:31.431
You don't want her
to get it?
RONALD: So?

20:31.464 --> 20:33.399
In fact,
the one thing you hated

20:33.433 --> 20:34.835
about the prospect
of divorce

20:34.868 --> 20:36.402
was that she'd get half,
right?

20:36.436 --> 20:37.504
Which she didn't deserve.

20:37.538 --> 20:39.840
But if you could get her
convicted of attempted murder,

20:39.873 --> 20:41.708
that would surely
disqualify her, wouldn't it?

20:41.742 --> 20:43.677
This isn't something
I hatched up.

20:43.710 --> 20:44.778
It's exactly that.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.680
Objection.
Sustained.

20:47.848 --> 20:48.549
When the police

20:48.582 --> 20:50.016
and the paramedics
first arrived,

20:50.050 --> 20:52.586
you said nothing about her
trying to kill you,

20:52.619 --> 20:53.453
did you, Mr. Morgan?

20:53.486 --> 20:54.788
I first didn't believe it.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.022
Didn't tell
the police anything

20:56.056 --> 20:57.658
about her face then,
did you?

20:57.691 --> 20:58.725
I was half dead.

20:58.759 --> 20:59.760
And then it came to you

20:59.793 --> 21:01.327
like a million-dollar
brainstorm.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.729
Objection.
Sustained.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.364
This is a way of getting even,
isn't it, Mr. Morgan?

21:04.397 --> 21:06.332
Get her convicted
of attempted murder...

21:06.366 --> 21:07.400
Argumentative.
Counsel.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.735
Disqualifying her
from everything.

21:08.769 --> 21:10.604
Yes, I ran myself over!

21:10.637 --> 21:12.706
This was an accident
and ruled an accident

21:12.739 --> 21:13.940
until you came up
with the idea

21:13.974 --> 21:15.509
about the expression
on her face,

21:15.542 --> 21:16.510
which you thought of later,

21:16.543 --> 21:18.645
based on a glimpse of less
than half a second.

21:18.679 --> 21:21.582
She's badgering the witness.
No, I'm cross-examining.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.017
How is it
that you didn't know

21:24.050 --> 21:25.952
she tried to kill you
right after the accident

21:25.986 --> 21:27.921
but that you came
to know it later, sir?

21:27.954 --> 21:29.756
What happened
since the accident --

21:29.790 --> 21:30.591
I figured it out.

21:30.624 --> 21:31.858
Well, what happened
since the accident

21:31.892 --> 21:33.026
that allowed you
to figure it out?

21:33.059 --> 21:34.460
I put 2 and 2 together.

21:34.494 --> 21:35.896
Oh, so it wasn't
the expression on her face.

21:35.929 --> 21:36.897
Yes, it was!

21:36.930 --> 21:38.765
Did hate color
your figuring, sir?

21:38.799 --> 21:40.333
Did money color it?

21:40.366 --> 21:41.702
Oh, great!
He's coding!

21:41.735 --> 21:42.969
Let's get out
of their way!

21:43.003 --> 21:44.037
Get the crash cart here stat!

21:45.706 --> 21:46.840
Clear the way!

21:48.108 --> 21:49.843
Mr. Morgan, this could be
your last chance.
Doctor! Get away!

21:49.876 --> 21:50.877
Did she try to kill you?

21:50.911 --> 21:52.445
If yes,
squeeze the doctor's hands.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.747
Will someone get
this man out of here?

21:53.780 --> 21:54.615
Mr. Morgan --

21:54.648 --> 21:55.782
get this man away from here!

21:57.483 --> 21:58.351
Atropine!

22:02.656 --> 22:04.024
That was despicable,
even for you!

22:04.057 --> 22:04.925
What the hell was that,

22:04.958 --> 22:06.793
the squeeze of the hand,
last chance bit?

22:06.827 --> 22:07.661
What the hell was that?

22:07.694 --> 22:09.029
Shut up, both of you!

22:09.062 --> 22:09.963
DOCTOR: He's in asystole.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.533
Continue CPR.
I'm giving an amp of bycarb.

22:13.066 --> 22:15.335
How long since the last epi?

22:25.712 --> 22:26.647
Is he okay?

22:26.680 --> 22:28.381
Not really. He's dead.

22:28.782 --> 22:29.950
Dead?

22:29.983 --> 22:31.151
His heart gave out.

22:31.184 --> 22:32.553
I'd offer condolences

22:32.586 --> 22:34.555
if I thought
any of you cared.

22:38.959 --> 22:40.561
You killed him.

22:48.769 --> 22:49.536
REBECCA: Dead?

22:49.570 --> 22:51.171
That's what she said.
What happened?

22:51.204 --> 22:52.839
Ellenor cross-examined
a man to death.

22:52.873 --> 22:54.040
LINDSAY: Excuse me?
All right.

22:54.074 --> 22:55.175
So, what's going to happen
with the trial?

22:55.208 --> 22:56.109
They don't know.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.010
They're conferencing
in Kittleson's chambers.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.780
If his testimony is out,
the trial is over.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.114
He was the whole case.

23:08.088 --> 23:10.557
I'm mindful every ethicist,

23:10.591 --> 23:14.094
as well as the leaders
of all our infertility groups,

23:14.127 --> 23:17.931
vent disgust at the prospect
of peddling eggs for cash.

23:19.199 --> 23:21.001
But Mr. Berluti is right.

23:21.835 --> 23:25.606
The law prohibits
selling human organs,

23:25.639 --> 23:27.741
but there's nothing
illegal yet

23:27.774 --> 23:30.443
about trafficking
sperm and eggs.

23:31.111 --> 23:33.680
I find the contract
to be binding

23:34.114 --> 23:39.553
and order the defendant
to pay costs plus interest.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.087
Adjourned.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.561
Thank you, Jimmy.

23:47.594 --> 23:50.564
Congratulations,
I guess.

23:50.597 --> 23:53.066
Look, I know It's not much
money, but the principle --

23:53.099 --> 23:56.102
Susan, if you're talking
about this case,

23:56.136 --> 23:58.171
I'd tell people
it was about money.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.707
Saying it's about
principle --

24:01.575 --> 24:03.644
you're selling your eggs.

24:06.046 --> 24:08.448
Can I talk to you
in private somewhere?

24:09.249 --> 24:10.951
(door opens)

24:16.723 --> 24:18.625
Know why
we broke up, Jimmy?

24:18.659 --> 24:20.594
It's coming back to me.

24:20.961 --> 24:23.630
It's because you were
always putting me down.

24:23.664 --> 24:25.265
You were always
finding fault.

24:25.298 --> 24:27.233
You were always telling me
Oh, come on. I didn't
put you down, Susan.

24:27.267 --> 24:28.602
what I was doing wrong
That had nothing
to do with --

24:28.635 --> 24:30.804
and never
letting me talk.

24:33.173 --> 24:35.876
You don't like the idea
of a woman selling her eggs.

24:35.909 --> 24:36.977
You don't like the idea

24:37.010 --> 24:38.579
of a woman
having an abortion.

24:38.612 --> 24:40.213
You've got a lot
of likes or dislikes

24:40.246 --> 24:41.682
that you're entitled to,

24:41.715 --> 24:44.751
but none of them
render you more principled.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.821
You want to know
what principle is, Jimmy?

24:47.854 --> 24:48.889
Yeah.
Why don't you tell me?

24:48.922 --> 24:51.024
It's recognizing
responsibility.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.093
Principle is duty
to your children,

24:53.126 --> 24:54.961
making sure that they are
fed and educated

24:54.995 --> 24:56.863
with a decent home,
and you don't have the

24:56.897 --> 24:58.231
slightest idea what that is.

24:58.264 --> 25:00.500
Tell your kids how you pay
the rent. You're like a
prostitute, Susan.

25:03.103 --> 25:05.138
What did you just say to me?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.950
When you go
to work every day,

25:17.618 --> 25:20.587
and you come into this room
with your clients,

25:21.888 --> 25:24.290
do you call them
murderers to their faces?

25:25.191 --> 25:27.794
Thieves,
child molesters?

25:27.828 --> 25:29.596
I doubt it.

25:30.330 --> 25:33.867
You quite likely show them
more respect than that.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.671
Me, you call a prostitute.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.009
You tell me, Jimmy,

25:44.344 --> 25:46.680
why was it you were always
so much harder on me

25:46.713 --> 25:48.181
than the rest
of the world?

25:49.349 --> 25:51.184
I'd really like to know
what it was

25:51.217 --> 25:52.686
Oh, please.
if you even have to ask,
That made me the brunt

25:52.719 --> 25:53.887
of your anger.
I never --
that says something.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.090
I loved you. That's why.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.035
Do you still?

26:09.069 --> 26:10.704
I don't know.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.111
This other woman?

26:23.349 --> 26:24.818
I don't know.

26:35.328 --> 26:36.763
Well...

26:38.999 --> 26:41.935
thank you again
for your services.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.605
You obviously turned out
to be quite a good lawyer.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.977
I'm sorry
I disappoint you.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.361
You saw it yourself,
she all but murdered him.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.296
What?
You're lucky I like you,
Ellenor --

27:10.330 --> 27:11.698
I'm lucky you like me?!

27:11.732 --> 27:14.200
Settle down. I'm sick
of these scream-fests.

27:14.234 --> 27:16.302
One could make the argument
she deliberately tried

27:16.336 --> 27:17.203
to induce
a fatal heart attack

27:17.237 --> 27:19.405
to eliminate a chief
prosecutorial witness.

27:19.439 --> 27:21.274
One could, but he'd be
a tiny little fool.

27:21.307 --> 27:24.044
Hey!
All right, now I am
warning both of you.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.680
Your honor, obviously
Mr. Morgan's testimony

27:26.713 --> 27:27.614
has to be excluded.

27:27.648 --> 27:30.150
Why?
Our client has to have
full opportunity

27:30.183 --> 27:31.451
for cross-examination.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.385
We were cut short.

27:32.418 --> 27:33.887
Bogus.
I'm sorry?

27:33.920 --> 27:36.422
If ever a witness were
fully cross-examined --

27:36.456 --> 27:38.124
she killed him!
Mr. Bay!

27:38.158 --> 27:40.126
I knew they would
try this. I knew it.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.327
Oh, what?
Do you have crystal balls?

27:41.361 --> 27:43.429
If only you had real --
ouch!
All right!

27:43.463 --> 27:45.465
He kicked me! Did you see that?
He just kicked me!

27:45.498 --> 27:47.333
That just cost you $500.

27:47.367 --> 27:50.704
The next insult
goes for $1,000.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.072
EUGENE: Your honor.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.074
Yes?

27:54.107 --> 27:55.842
Even if you find
we were afforded

27:55.876 --> 27:57.778
full opportunity
for cross-examination,

27:57.811 --> 27:58.879
what happened?

27:58.912 --> 28:00.280
The man had a heart attack.

28:00.313 --> 28:03.049
The danger of Miss Frutt
coming off unsympathetic --

28:03.083 --> 28:04.184
It's too prejudicial.

28:06.386 --> 28:08.822
I didn't say anything.
I didn't kick anybody.

28:08.855 --> 28:11.491
With all due respect,
he has clearly lost his mind.

28:11.525 --> 28:14.094
With all due respect,
that just cost you $1,000.

28:14.127 --> 28:15.461
May I speak?

28:15.495 --> 28:17.798
You may speak.
Do not kick.

28:17.831 --> 28:21.735
Do not stomp.
Do not even move your legs.

28:22.836 --> 28:24.170
Even if you were inclined

28:24.204 --> 28:25.806
to exclude
Mr. Morgan's testimony

28:25.839 --> 28:27.908
on the grounds
their cross was cut short --

28:27.941 --> 28:30.711
a decision which would border
on judicial misconduct --

28:31.311 --> 28:33.446
we could, nevertheless,
still introduce

28:33.479 --> 28:35.448
Mr. Morgan's statement
that his wife Louise

28:35.481 --> 28:36.850
tried to kill him.

28:36.883 --> 28:37.851
Why?
How?

28:37.884 --> 28:40.787
As Mr. Morgan was suffering
his fatal coronary,

28:40.821 --> 28:42.122
I asked him that question.

28:42.155 --> 28:43.524
He answered yes,

28:43.557 --> 28:46.392
an answer which would qualify
as a dying declaration

28:46.426 --> 28:49.062
which need not be subject
to cross-examination

28:49.095 --> 28:50.430
in order to be admissible.

28:50.463 --> 28:51.532
Is that why
you did that --

28:51.565 --> 28:53.199
asked him to squeeze
the doctor's hand?

28:53.233 --> 28:54.500
And you're calling me
despicable?

28:54.535 --> 28:56.202
Counsel.
These attacks
are outrageous.

28:56.236 --> 28:57.337
The witness
was stroking out,

28:57.370 --> 28:59.940
and he asked a question
to qualify a dying declaration.

28:59.973 --> 29:02.142
And It's the defense attorneys
that are called scum?

29:02.175 --> 29:04.144
Your honor, "scum"
should cost her $2,000.

29:04.177 --> 29:05.512
Well, let me know
when it costs $20,000,

29:05.546 --> 29:07.948
you vile, disgusting,
repulsive little cockroach!

29:07.981 --> 29:10.884
You are a desperate
person, Ellenor.
You grab a dying man to go

29:10.917 --> 29:12.218
for the big win...
I bet George Vogelman has
a brother. Give him a call.

29:12.252 --> 29:13.854
Go to Cabo, huh?
And then you lecture me
about the nobility of law,

29:13.887 --> 29:16.122
you vicious little peanut!
Hey!

29:20.994 --> 29:23.196
Why do you hate me so?

29:23.229 --> 29:24.064
Why do I hate you?

29:24.097 --> 29:26.366
Richard, you're the one
who starts it.

29:26.399 --> 29:27.701
I'm just standing up
for myself.
All right, all right,

29:27.734 --> 29:30.036
you guys are the ones
who are the bullies.
All right, all right,

29:30.436 --> 29:32.005
I don't even know
why I'm here.

29:32.839 --> 29:36.009
You're here to keep them
from killing each other.

29:37.010 --> 29:40.013
I am editing the videotaped
deposition personally.

29:40.046 --> 29:42.415
I will admit those parts
where I feel

29:42.448 --> 29:44.250
you have had ample cross.

29:44.284 --> 29:45.251
We go to court tomorrow

29:45.285 --> 29:47.253
and we will try
the rest of it.

29:48.454 --> 29:52.058
Any of this nonsense
goes on in my courtroom

29:52.092 --> 29:54.160
I will be sending you
to the bar

29:54.194 --> 29:58.164
with my recommendation
for a 60-day suspension.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.835
Let them out.

30:01.868 --> 30:03.069
Good.

30:05.872 --> 30:07.574
I have a date.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.052
Did you love her?
I used to.

30:19.085 --> 30:21.154
And some of those feelings
came back?

30:21.187 --> 30:22.222
I don't know.

30:22.255 --> 30:26.192
It's like I realize

30:26.226 --> 30:29.129
I looked at her like maybe
she could have been

30:29.162 --> 30:30.496
the mother
of my children,

30:30.531 --> 30:33.534
so, I held her up
to higher standards.

30:33.567 --> 30:35.068
And it made me think.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.369
When I see Roberta,

30:36.402 --> 30:38.071
I don't look
at her that way --

30:38.104 --> 30:40.073
as the mother
of my kids or --

30:40.106 --> 30:41.441
she's got no eggs
left to sell.

30:41.474 --> 30:42.375
That ain't funny.

30:43.977 --> 30:46.212
But there is some truth
to it, Jimmy.

30:46.246 --> 30:48.081
You want a family one day,

30:48.114 --> 30:49.215
and maybe you don't
see that with Roberta,

30:49.249 --> 30:51.051
but you can see it
with Susan.

30:51.685 --> 30:53.887
Susan's not
in the picture.

30:53.920 --> 30:54.588
I'm not?

31:01.161 --> 31:02.863
Am I really
out of the picture?

31:11.404 --> 31:13.406
Well, y-you think --

31:14.575 --> 31:16.409
you want to --

31:17.544 --> 31:18.612
I --

31:18.645 --> 31:19.946
He mumbles
when he's smitten.

31:19.980 --> 31:22.916
Lucy.
Lucy.

31:30.323 --> 31:32.225
How about
I take you to dinner?

31:34.160 --> 31:38.231
Well, before I do
anything like that,

31:38.264 --> 31:39.966
I got some ends
that I got to clean up

31:40.000 --> 31:41.301
with somebody else.

31:51.612 --> 31:54.347
So, I'm assuming
they'll put their client up,

31:54.380 --> 31:55.716
and then
we'll pretty much close.

31:55.749 --> 31:57.383
I mean,
It's a short trial.

31:57.417 --> 32:00.186
Great. Then we can get
some counseling?

32:00.220 --> 32:02.222
Helen, she did
knowingly cross-examine

32:02.255 --> 32:03.289
a man with a weak heart.

32:03.323 --> 32:05.291
I don't want to hear
about it anymore.

32:05.325 --> 32:06.392
You used up
your whole date

32:06.426 --> 32:08.194
talking about a case,
Richard.

32:08.695 --> 32:10.296
Does that mean
I'm not getting another one?

32:11.397 --> 32:14.100
Well, I can't say
I had the greatest time,

32:14.134 --> 32:15.368
considering
all through dinner

32:15.401 --> 32:16.670
you slammed my roommate.

32:16.703 --> 32:18.104
Oh, you should have heard

32:18.138 --> 32:19.239
the way that
she went after this guy.

32:19.272 --> 32:21.207
You kicked her twice.

32:21.241 --> 32:22.676
You even took
a run at Eugene.

32:22.709 --> 32:25.211
What, do you have
some sort of a death wish?

32:25.245 --> 32:26.580
Maybe.

32:27.480 --> 32:28.715
What? Tell me.

32:31.652 --> 32:33.119
Part of me --

32:34.287 --> 32:36.623
I think I do want
to get into a fight,

32:36.657 --> 32:38.258
a fistfight.

32:39.292 --> 32:41.461
You ever bother
to ask yourself why?

32:43.764 --> 32:45.632
I was captain
of the debate team

32:45.666 --> 32:46.733
growing up,

32:46.767 --> 32:48.334
president
of the chess club,

32:48.368 --> 32:50.571
3-time state spelling bee
champion,

32:51.805 --> 32:54.107
but on the playground,

32:54.140 --> 32:58.512
I-I just...got picked on.

33:01.081 --> 33:03.984
I would love
to get into a fight.

33:08.321 --> 33:10.390
Well, I think you should
see somebody about that,

33:11.658 --> 33:13.126
but in the meantime,

33:13.159 --> 33:15.061
if you are going
to take runs,

33:15.095 --> 33:17.230
taking one at Eugene
isn't smart --

33:17.263 --> 33:20.100
or even Ellenor,
for that matter.

33:20.133 --> 33:21.535
Yeah.

33:23.436 --> 33:27.107
Well, I'd better go work on
my closing argument.

33:30.143 --> 33:31.612
Can we go out
one more time?

33:31.645 --> 33:35.081
I promise
not to slam roommates.

33:35.115 --> 33:36.282
Another chance?

33:38.585 --> 33:40.253
Sure.

33:42.623 --> 33:44.324
Good night.

33:44.357 --> 33:45.726
Good night.

33:54.768 --> 33:56.703
I go for you --

33:56.737 --> 33:58.505
the whole package.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.487
Why wouldn't
the garage clicker work?

34:15.522 --> 34:18.091
I don't know. Maybe
the batteries were too low.

34:18.123 --> 34:19.592
It often didn't work.

34:19.626 --> 34:22.495
So, your husband
opened the garage door...

34:22.529 --> 34:26.099
and I went to inch forward,
and the car lurched.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.500
I went for the brakes,

34:27.534 --> 34:30.335
and I hit the accelerator
by mistake,

34:30.370 --> 34:32.405
and I ran
right over Ronald.

34:32.438 --> 34:33.406
It was an accident.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.108
Of course
it was an accident.

34:35.141 --> 34:36.476
Well, Mrs. Morgan,

34:36.510 --> 34:38.478
it has become known
to many people

34:38.512 --> 34:41.481
that you and your husband
had become very estranged.

34:41.514 --> 34:44.685
Many husbands and wives
become estranged.

34:44.717 --> 34:47.487
That doesn't mean that they
try to kill each other.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.255
The ones who do --

34:49.289 --> 34:51.224
we usually see them charged
with attempted murder.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.525
ELLENOR and EUGENE:
Objection.

34:52.559 --> 34:53.493
Sustained.

34:53.527 --> 34:56.196
Mrs. Morgan, you said
you hit the accelerator

34:56.228 --> 34:59.399
to inch forward when the car
just suddenly lurched.

34:59.432 --> 35:00.400
Yes.

35:00.433 --> 35:03.236
Your husband was what,
2, 3 feet in front of you?

35:03.269 --> 35:04.638
Yes.

35:04.671 --> 35:06.640
Why was your foot hitting
the accelerator at all

35:06.673 --> 35:09.275
with a man standing 2 to 3 feet
in front of the car?

35:09.309 --> 35:11.177
Because I was inching.

35:11.211 --> 35:12.513
Inching into a lurch.

35:12.546 --> 35:14.414
Objection.
Objection.
Sustained.

35:14.447 --> 35:15.816
You ever have
the car checked out?

35:15.849 --> 35:16.850
Yes.

35:16.883 --> 35:20.153
No.
Did they find any cause
why it would lurch?

35:20.186 --> 35:21.655
Did you sue
the auto maker?

35:21.688 --> 35:24.558
Did I sue
the auto maker?
Yes,

35:24.591 --> 35:27.293
a car lurches, causing you to
run over you husband..

35:27.327 --> 35:29.663
I-I think you'd find that
annoying.

35:29.696 --> 35:31.297
Objection!
Objection!

35:31.331 --> 35:33.266
Withdrawn. Do you still
drive this car?

35:33.299 --> 35:34.334
Yes.

35:34.367 --> 35:35.168
After what happened?

35:35.201 --> 35:37.437
Aren't you afraid
it'll happen again?

35:37.470 --> 35:40.373
The main error
was human error

35:40.406 --> 35:44.310
when I hit the accelerator
hard going for the brake.

35:46.379 --> 35:49.783
She hit the accelerator hard
going for the brake

35:49.816 --> 35:53.554
with a man she hated standing
2 feet in front of the car.

35:53.587 --> 35:56.489
He dies,
she inherits everything.

35:56.523 --> 35:58.859
They divorce,
she gets half.

35:58.892 --> 36:01.327
None of us were there.

36:01.361 --> 36:02.128
Who are we to say

36:02.162 --> 36:03.930
it couldn't have been
an accident?

36:04.731 --> 36:07.400
None of us has ever had
a car lurch.

36:07.433 --> 36:08.468
None of us has ever

36:08.501 --> 36:09.903
inadvertently hit
the accelerator

36:09.936 --> 36:11.572
while going for the brake.

36:11.605 --> 36:13.206
None of us has ever
driven a car

36:13.239 --> 36:16.910
over somebody we hated
and inherited $2 million.

36:16.943 --> 36:20.380
You listened to the testimony
of the victim.

36:20.413 --> 36:21.715
He saw her face.

36:21.748 --> 36:23.316
He read that face --

36:23.349 --> 36:27.621
a face that he had been
reading for over 30 years.

36:27.654 --> 36:31.525
She was gunning for him.
She was trying to kill him.

36:31.558 --> 36:36.563
A face he saw for a fraction
of a fraction of a second.

36:36.597 --> 36:38.832
That's their case,
ladies and gentlemen --

36:38.865 --> 36:42.302
a look for a fraction
of a fraction of a second

36:42.335 --> 36:44.370
while a car
is coming at you.

36:45.305 --> 36:46.940
How reliable is that?

36:47.508 --> 36:48.875
Are you going to tell me

36:48.909 --> 36:50.877
reasonable doubt
can be overcome

36:50.911 --> 36:54.915
by a fraction
of a fraction of a second?

36:59.720 --> 37:02.355
(door knocking)

37:03.824 --> 37:04.658
Hey, what's this I hear

37:04.691 --> 37:07.260
about you brokering eggs
on the internet?

37:07.293 --> 37:10.564
Funny. How's it going?

37:10.597 --> 37:11.565
What's wrong?

37:11.598 --> 37:13.534
Nothing's wrong.
I just stopped by.

37:13.567 --> 37:14.768
Oh, I can always tell

37:14.801 --> 37:16.302
when something's the matter
with you, Jimmy.

37:16.336 --> 37:17.571
Your forehead beads up.

37:19.873 --> 37:21.642
This is kind of hard
for me to say.

37:21.675 --> 37:23.910
Well, why don't you just say it?

37:25.011 --> 37:29.650
Okay. I like a lot of things
about our relationship,

37:29.683 --> 37:32.385
but there' some stuff
I find wanting.

37:33.453 --> 37:35.522
You find wanting?

37:35.556 --> 37:37.658
What do you find
wanting, Jimmy?

37:38.525 --> 37:43.764
Well, I want to have
a family one day...soon,

37:43.797 --> 37:47.367
and I think I'm just
kidding myself thinking

37:48.802 --> 37:51.705
that you and I
could go that way.

37:52.105 --> 37:53.273
Mmm.

37:59.412 --> 38:01.915
You came in here
to end our relationship?

38:03.517 --> 38:05.886
Well...yes.

38:06.687 --> 38:10.991
I'm 37. I got to
take stock of what I am,

38:11.024 --> 38:13.459
where I'm going,

38:13.493 --> 38:15.829
take control
of my life's direction.

38:18.665 --> 38:20.300
You think
you know yourself?

38:21.434 --> 38:23.737
You don't know yourself.

38:23.770 --> 38:25.739
I know you, Jimmy,

38:25.772 --> 38:27.340
and trust me
when I tell you

38:27.373 --> 38:28.675
you'll be coming back.

38:29.743 --> 38:32.946
It might take two months,
maybe three,

38:33.780 --> 38:35.481
but you'll be back.

38:36.016 --> 38:37.050
You want to know why?

38:37.651 --> 38:38.685
No.

38:39.653 --> 38:40.754
Yeah.

38:41.087 --> 38:43.023
Because of your mother
and father.

38:43.824 --> 38:45.926
You were raised
as a strict catholic.

38:45.959 --> 38:48.061
You grew up
sexually repressed,

38:48.094 --> 38:49.996
and what you're going
to be looking for in a woman

38:50.030 --> 38:51.397
more than anything else

38:51.431 --> 38:53.800
is a woman
who liberates you sexually,

38:53.834 --> 38:56.469
who makes you feel sexual.

38:58.705 --> 39:00.874
Do you really think

39:00.907 --> 39:03.710
that you can be
with just anybody

39:03.744 --> 39:06.079
what you are with me?

39:07.981 --> 39:09.850
The best sex
you have ever had --

39:09.883 --> 39:12.485
will ever have --
you'll get it right here,

39:12.519 --> 39:14.487
nowhere even close.

39:18.559 --> 39:19.292
And whether you want

39:19.325 --> 39:22.763
to admit that
to yourself or not,

39:23.730 --> 39:26.066
it's important to you.

39:29.536 --> 39:30.704
(door knocking)

39:32.472 --> 39:33.640
Jury's back.

39:58.599 --> 40:00.466
Will the defendant
please rise?

40:02.068 --> 40:04.004
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

40:04.571 --> 40:05.606
We have, your honor.

40:05.639 --> 40:06.973
What say you?

40:08.074 --> 40:09.743
Commonwealth
vs Louise Morgan

40:09.776 --> 40:11.411
on the charge
of attempted murder --

40:11.945 --> 40:14.681
we find the defendant
Louise Morgan

40:14.715 --> 40:16.149
not guilty.

40:16.182 --> 40:18.051
Oh, thank you, thank you.

40:18.084 --> 40:19.019
ROBERTA:
The jury is dismissed

40:19.052 --> 40:20.220
with the thanks
of the court.

40:20.253 --> 40:22.055
We're adjourned.
Thank you.

40:22.689 --> 40:23.557
[ bangs gavel ]

40:25.125 --> 40:26.660
Oh, thank you.

40:34.234 --> 40:36.703
You know, I'm still having
trouble with my garage door.

40:36.737 --> 40:39.005
Maybe you can be there
to open it when I get home.

40:39.039 --> 40:40.841
All right, Louise.

40:52.586 --> 40:55.121
It's stacked
against us sometimes.

40:56.022 --> 40:57.791
Little old ladies.

40:58.759 --> 41:00.060
Forget it.

41:01.127 --> 41:02.963
I want to run
every member of that jury

41:02.996 --> 41:03.697
through the computer.

41:03.730 --> 41:05.198
If there's
an outstanding ticket,

41:05.231 --> 41:07.200
I'm going to impound
their cars.

41:08.134 --> 41:09.803
Come on.
I'll take you to lunch.

41:09.836 --> 41:11.237
I mean it, Helen.

41:11.271 --> 41:12.272
Let's go.

41:14.841 --> 41:16.677
You know, this morning
I was sorry I kicked Ellenor.

41:16.710 --> 41:18.912
Now I'm not.
I'm glad I kicked her.

41:18.945 --> 41:19.780
Okay.

41:19.813 --> 41:20.914
I mean it.

41:21.982 --> 41:24.184
The next time she tries
anything like that again...

41:27.621 --> 41:28.254
Susan.

41:28.288 --> 41:29.623
Hey, am I early?

41:29.656 --> 41:32.192
No. I -- no.

41:32.793 --> 41:34.928
Okay. I made a reservation
at Tigerlilies.

41:34.961 --> 41:35.896
Have you ever been?

41:35.929 --> 41:39.966
No. Susan, uh...

41:44.170 --> 41:48.208
my unfinished business --
It's still unfinished.

41:49.710 --> 41:52.713
Okay. Does that
preclude lunch?

41:53.346 --> 41:56.683
Well, the thing is...

41:57.083 --> 41:59.553
I don't think
I want to finish it.

42:00.186 --> 42:01.688
I'm...

42:02.055 --> 42:03.624
I'm still involved.

42:04.991 --> 42:06.159
Oh.

42:06.860 --> 42:10.731
Well...uh...

42:10.764 --> 42:12.566
you know how terrific
I think you are --

42:12.599 --> 42:17.571
Jimmy, don't insult me
by putting a ribbon --

42:17.604 --> 42:19.606
I get it.

42:19.640 --> 42:23.309
Better I get it now than
after I went down a path.

42:24.645 --> 42:26.813
This is what I'm thinking.

42:28.682 --> 42:33.353
Well, again, as my lawyer.

42:33.386 --> 42:35.255
Yeah.

42:36.823 --> 42:38.324
Bye, Jimmy.

42:40.694 --> 42:41.795
Bye.

42:57.210 --> 42:59.780
I'm heading down.
I'll see you out.
