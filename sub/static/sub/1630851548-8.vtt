09:37.800 --> 09:40.233
DIVORCED, HER PARENTS DIED.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.800
>> I WAS CARETAKING FOR MY

09:41.866 --> 09:42.733
PARENTS FIRST AND THAT

09:42.800 --> 09:44.433
DESTABILIZES PEOPLE'S ECONOMY

09:44.500 --> 09:46.233
AND PRIMARILY WOMEN WHO ARE THE

09:46.300 --> 09:48.966
CARETAKERS -- THEN, ALSO THE

09:49.033 --> 09:51.333
BIGGEST DESTABILIZE HER OF ALL

09:51.400 --> 09:53.000
BESIDES THE FACT THAT I'M NOW A

09:53.066 --> 09:55.566
FREELANCER AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID

09:55.633 --> 09:59.566
IF I DON'T DIE OF A WORSE

09:59.633 --> 10:02.000
DISEASE, IT WILL BE DEATH BY A

10:02.066 --> 10:02.700
THOUSAND INVOICES.

10:02.766 --> 10:05.733
IT'S SO HARD TO BE A FREELANCER

10:05.800 --> 10:06.700
WITHOUT BENEFITS.

10:06.766 --> 10:07.933
THAT'S THE ISSUE AND THAT WAS

10:08.000 --> 10:10.166
THE BREAKING POINT FOR ME WAS

10:10.233 --> 10:10.466
HEALTH CARE.

10:10.533 --> 10:13.933
>> Bill: AND THIS GIG ECONOMY,

10:14.000 --> 10:14.966

10:52.933 --> 10:54.033
AT THE SAME TIME THAT HAPPENED

10:54.100 --> 10:59.933
TO ME THIS TIME LAST YEAR, MARCN

11:00.000 --> 11:02.233
AMERICANS LOST THEIR

11:05.066 --> 11:06.300
>> HENCE IT DOWNWARD MOBILITY.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.266
>> I BECAME A LANDLADY AND

11:09.333 --> 11:09.933
STARTED TAKING IN PEOPLE TO HELP

11:10.000 --> 11:11.633
MY RENT.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.566
>> Bill: THE HOMELESS PEOPLE

11:13.633 --> 11:14.166
YOU TOOK IN, THEY WEREN'T

11:14.233 --> 11:15.066

11:17.333 --> 11:18.833
WHAT HAPPENED WAS I LOST A

11:18.900 --> 11:19.833
TENANT AT THE LAST MINUTE AND I

11:34.233 --> 11:35.866
YOU GET A STIPEND, A SMALL

11:35.933 --> 11:37.000
STIPEND.

11:37.066 --> 11:38.133
NO ONE IS GETTING RICH DOING

11:38.200 --> 11:38.400
THIS.

11:38.466 --> 11:41.833
YOU'RE NOT GETTING TO THE TOP

11:41.900 --> 11:42.033
1%.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.966
>> Bill: BUT EVERY BIT HELPS.

11:44.033 --> 11:46.000
>> I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER

11:46.066 --> 11:48.033

11:48.100 --> 11:49.966
HEARD THAT PHRASE, I JUST WANT

úNAMES INTO A BACKGROUND SEARCH

13:22.266 --> 13:23.200
AND I NEVER HAD ANY EXPERIENCE
