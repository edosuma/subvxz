WEBVTT

00:01.177 --> 00:02.816
Previously on Harrow...

00:03.253 --> 00:04.692
I want to see if I can postpone

00:04.717 --> 00:06.516
the cremation of some remains.

00:07.050 --> 00:10.249
I just got a visit from
your friend, Soroya Dass.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.729
Is Robert dead?

00:11.937 --> 00:13.163
Beg your pardon?

00:13.220 --> 00:15.059
How much did you dislike Robert Quinn?

00:15.732 --> 00:17.217
I didn't dislike him.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.013
I hated him.

00:19.062 --> 00:20.943
I know you want a place of our own.

00:21.163 --> 00:24.083
My stepmum said it's
ours, if we want it.

00:26.389 --> 00:27.583
We'll go.

00:27.629 --> 00:30.113
Quinn's phone went
black on October 3rd.

00:30.189 --> 00:32.182
I want to search that
bushland and trawl that dam.

00:32.225 --> 00:35.145
Six recruits and a supervisor.
One day.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:42.183 --> 02:43.743
I see.

03:00.850 --> 03:02.170
You're off the case.

03:03.122 --> 03:04.262
You're kidding me.

03:04.287 --> 03:06.548
You should be thanking me
for not suspending you.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.128
I authorised six recruits.

03:09.210 --> 03:10.976
Now I have to pay for 16.

03:11.049 --> 03:12.169
Slip of the pen.

03:12.384 --> 03:14.371
It's CIB's baby now.

03:14.789 --> 03:16.104
Do you believe...

03:16.129 --> 03:18.773
that those river bones in that
concrete are Robert Quinn?

03:19.989 --> 03:21.468
I do.

03:21.570 --> 03:23.409
Yeah, I think Harrow does too.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.698
He stopped the bones
from being cremated.

03:25.812 --> 03:27.152
OK, I'll ask it.

03:27.222 --> 03:28.621
What do we do about Harrow?

03:28.850 --> 03:30.135
What do you mean?

03:30.160 --> 03:32.439
He means I don't think we
can tell Harrow about this.

03:32.464 --> 03:34.065
That's not fair.

03:34.090 --> 03:36.569
It's a conflict of interest. He
was married to Quinn's wife.

03:36.810 --> 03:39.610
I just need Harrow
to focus on his work,

03:39.635 --> 03:41.690
and if he finds out that those bones

03:41.715 --> 03:42.978
could have been Steph's husband,

03:43.003 --> 03:44.484
then...
-We get it, we get it.

03:44.509 --> 03:46.531
I mean, Harrow still
has feelings for Steph

03:46.623 --> 03:48.457
and now it'll become personal.

03:49.369 --> 03:50.569
What?

03:52.563 --> 03:54.802
You and Harrow?

03:55.220 --> 03:56.429
It's nobody's business.

03:56.454 --> 03:57.616
It's mine now.

03:57.677 --> 03:59.156
You're definitely off this case.

03:59.675 --> 04:02.235
Can't afford to have
you distracted either.

04:02.582 --> 04:04.622
Bryan. Maxine.
-Nick.

04:05.876 --> 04:09.073
If, those river bones
require some more work,

04:09.119 --> 04:10.286
can you deal with Fairley?

04:10.311 --> 04:11.510
Yeah.

04:15.050 --> 04:16.930
Falsified a request form?

04:19.975 --> 04:21.889
Good find, though.
-Right?

04:22.023 --> 04:23.702
Yeah, just don't tell your boyfriend.

04:31.449 --> 04:33.418
You've reached
Sergeant Dass, Scenes of Crime.

04:33.442 --> 04:34.841
Leave me a message.

04:34.889 --> 04:37.768
What was the 'X' you
left me this morning?

04:37.843 --> 04:40.042
What did it mean? Was it X-rated?

04:40.612 --> 04:44.289
I'd have thought I was at least
a double X, maybe even a triple.

04:44.722 --> 04:46.842
Let me know you're OK.

04:53.329 --> 04:55.129
Did I miss the coup?

04:58.736 --> 05:01.224
That says, "To Professor
Maxine Pavich."

05:01.249 --> 05:02.768
Are you stealing
both of our identities?

05:04.426 --> 05:06.325
This was in MY pigeon hole.

05:06.396 --> 05:07.845
I really don't want to think
about your pigeon hole.

05:07.869 --> 05:09.741
Do you know who called
Maxine this morning?

05:09.816 --> 05:13.202
Captain Rhetorical
from the SS Don't Answer?

05:13.227 --> 05:14.586
Professor Lucien Gotti,

05:14.669 --> 05:17.308
from the Geneva Institute
of Science and Medicine.

05:17.349 --> 05:19.312
Well, Pavich isn't here.
How do you know?

05:19.337 --> 05:21.287
Lucien Gotti was "impressed"

05:21.312 --> 05:23.841
by my paper on
pathophysiology of shock.

05:25.823 --> 05:28.478
Come on, Harrow. Put it together.

05:28.690 --> 05:31.592
Gotti likes my paper, he
tries to Skype my boss,

05:31.617 --> 05:33.616
and then I find this in my hole.

05:33.655 --> 05:34.934
I think that was a mistake.

05:35.009 --> 05:36.967
No.
No, no, no, no.

05:37.060 --> 05:38.607
You know what it is?

05:38.690 --> 05:40.210
I'm being headjobbed.

05:40.602 --> 05:43.072
Headhunted, I think you mean.
-Whatever.

05:43.097 --> 05:47.135
The Geneva Institute of Science
and Medicine wants me.

05:47.762 --> 05:49.282
Hey.

05:49.909 --> 05:52.082
Personal mail, personal Skypes?

05:52.107 --> 05:53.426
You're crossing the line, Lyle.

05:53.496 --> 05:54.775
This, coming from you?

05:54.800 --> 05:57.072
It's not your business.
-You're jealous.

05:58.236 --> 06:00.275
Look, it's my two favourite people.

06:00.369 --> 06:01.741
Well, not favourite people, but...

06:04.069 --> 06:06.149
Check-in, please.

06:09.489 --> 06:10.848
What is it?

06:10.882 --> 06:12.114
Motor vehicle accident.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.818
Middle-aged woman, adult son.

06:13.843 --> 06:15.282
Enjoy.
-No, no, no, no, no.

06:15.362 --> 06:16.784
No, I've got plenty to do.

06:16.809 --> 06:19.254
Yes, but if you do these,
I'll have nothing to do, so...

06:19.315 --> 06:21.594
I am not doing these.
-Yes, you are.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.715
You two can work together.

06:23.859 --> 06:25.759
I want to see if it's possible.

06:26.078 --> 06:27.359
There's absolutely no way...
-Why can't he do them both?

06:27.383 --> 06:31.422
I said "work together".

06:31.447 --> 06:32.527
What is that?

06:32.552 --> 06:33.902
This was misdelivered.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.658
Mind your own business, Daniel.

06:37.029 --> 06:38.468
And get those two to the viewing room.

06:38.493 --> 06:40.132
There's a relative who
wants to ID them.

06:40.162 --> 06:42.870
Why can't you do it?
-I have an international call.

06:50.189 --> 06:51.594
Hello.

06:53.736 --> 06:55.415
You look very handsome this morning.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.817
What the hell is wrong with you?

06:57.974 --> 06:59.777
Nobody seems to want
to talk to me today,

06:59.808 --> 07:01.510
so I'm trying to generate
some good karma.

07:01.535 --> 07:04.110
That horse has SO bolted.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.432
Hello. I'm Daniel and this is Simon.

07:11.457 --> 07:12.572
Please come in.

07:12.690 --> 07:15.789
I'm Tiff Swale and this
is Audrey Matheson.

07:18.129 --> 07:21.808
There is, no easy
way to do this, Audrey.

07:22.170 --> 07:23.690
You OK?

07:45.709 --> 07:46.869
OK.

07:47.131 --> 07:48.690
Do you want to go?

07:51.575 --> 07:53.467
Can I stay with her for a bit?

07:54.249 --> 07:55.769
Yes, of course.

08:10.402 --> 08:12.316
It's gonna break a lot of hearts.

08:12.629 --> 08:15.396
Old car, was it? No airbags?

08:15.902 --> 08:17.381
Kerrie was driving.

08:17.543 --> 08:19.342
She always drove her boy to work.

08:19.721 --> 08:22.009
Glenn was... he was learning-impaired.

08:22.283 --> 08:23.451
Couldn't drive.

08:23.506 --> 08:25.356
Local farmer came across
the wreck this morning.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.724
Will you excuse me?

08:27.749 --> 08:29.663
People want to know what's going on.

09:01.549 --> 09:03.108
Hi.
-Hi.

09:03.222 --> 09:04.781
Do I need proof of life?

09:04.890 --> 09:07.060
Well, if you don't like women
leaving before you wake up,

09:07.085 --> 09:08.844
you shouldn't live on a boat.

09:09.010 --> 09:11.084
Where are you?

09:11.140 --> 09:12.892
Half an hour out of town on an MVA.

09:12.917 --> 09:15.098
That's a bit straightforward
for you, isn't it?

09:15.203 --> 09:16.442
Double fatality.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.802
Female 60s, male 30s?

09:18.856 --> 09:20.215
You've got them.

09:20.362 --> 09:22.562
Yes, their daughter just IDed them.

09:23.695 --> 09:25.284
Coming in for the autopsies?

09:25.369 --> 09:27.129
Ooh, swoon.

09:27.935 --> 09:31.654
No, I'm gonna stay
and check this vehicle in.

09:32.342 --> 09:33.782
OK.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.122
I just need coffee.

09:37.802 --> 09:39.161
Talk to you soon.

09:39.282 --> 09:40.602
Bye.

09:51.949 --> 09:54.104
"I am excited..." I am thrilled?

09:54.129 --> 09:55.928
I am jubilant? No, I'm not ju...

09:56.170 --> 09:58.577
"I am excited..."

10:09.396 --> 10:11.875
Hi, Steph.
-Bryan.

10:12.129 --> 10:13.130
Hi.

10:13.199 --> 10:14.569
Got a minute?

10:14.709 --> 10:16.228
Yeah, come in.

10:16.330 --> 10:17.627
Thanks.

10:23.762 --> 10:25.296
Good news, bad news.

10:25.389 --> 10:26.988
Good news, tickets.

10:27.489 --> 10:29.529
Bad news, doesn't
leave till after 5:00.

10:30.216 --> 10:31.615
Stay here and look after the stuff.

10:31.968 --> 10:33.221
Where are you going?

10:33.330 --> 10:34.650
Be back soon.

10:35.843 --> 10:37.842
Why do I have to be in here?

10:37.983 --> 10:39.504
So we can share Simon.

10:39.549 --> 10:41.645
I don't like arguing over the deceased.

10:41.733 --> 10:45.095
But why can't I do mine in my
room and you do yours in here?

10:45.156 --> 10:46.942
So we can share Simon.

10:46.983 --> 10:49.582
There is so much therapy
being born in here right now.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.214
I'm going to see Maxine.
-She wants us to work together.

10:52.239 --> 10:54.391
What's the point if I'm leaving?
-You'd really leave?

10:54.416 --> 10:56.432
God, yes. Wouldn't you?

10:57.449 --> 10:59.522
Alright, fine. But I
get first CAT scan.

10:59.616 --> 11:00.877
No. No.
-What?

11:01.584 --> 11:03.009
I'll be Switzerland.

11:05.669 --> 11:07.108
Geneva.

11:07.403 --> 11:08.763
Heads.

11:13.096 --> 11:14.935
Anterior visual.

11:15.451 --> 11:19.727
Impact trauma visible on right
cheek and right mandible,

11:19.752 --> 11:21.752
consistent with car.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.988
So she was looking left
when she hit the tree.

11:25.049 --> 11:28.811
Broken skin and torn
musculature over right clavicle

11:28.836 --> 11:30.715
and above right breast...
-This left arm here.

11:30.843 --> 11:32.828
The scratches. And this femur...
-Do you mind?

11:32.853 --> 11:34.201
Looks to me to be broken.

11:34.249 --> 11:35.977
Do you think he was trying to prise
her hand away from the wheel?

11:36.001 --> 11:37.531
You do know frontal lobe blockage

11:37.556 --> 11:39.911
can result in involuntary
muscle contraction?

11:39.936 --> 11:41.175
What, so you're thinking stroke?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.521
I'm not thinking. I'm observing.

11:45.450 --> 11:47.137
You'd really leave?

11:47.249 --> 11:50.168
Why not? I mean, you
resigned not so long ago.

11:50.694 --> 11:52.169
That was for Fern.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.913
So why did you change your mind?

11:53.976 --> 11:55.776
That was for Fern too.

11:58.576 --> 12:00.696
How does your coming back help Fern?

12:02.156 --> 12:03.475
Maybe it doesn't.

12:03.610 --> 12:05.099
I'm a screw-up.

12:05.489 --> 12:08.009
That's why I leave such
a path of destruction.

12:16.863 --> 12:18.891
What, are you down to
your last ginger snap?

12:19.103 --> 12:21.383
Harrow not paying child support?

12:22.882 --> 12:24.961
Fern's 18 now, so he doesn't need to.

12:25.009 --> 12:26.448
And yet he still does.

12:26.845 --> 12:30.307
So... why are you here?

12:30.410 --> 12:31.947
What have you found?

12:43.389 --> 12:44.908
Did he insure this?

12:45.130 --> 12:47.104
You know we never seemed to
have money for anything else,

12:47.129 --> 12:48.539
but he always took care of that car.

12:48.564 --> 12:49.639
It was his baby.

12:49.664 --> 12:52.982
In the last 10 months, has there
been a claim made against it?

12:53.623 --> 12:55.743
Not that I'm aware of.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.215
Thanks for your time, Steph.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.863
We've decided Harrow

13:19.888 --> 13:21.769
doesn't need to be distracted by this.

13:21.991 --> 13:23.449
What are you saying?

13:23.476 --> 13:25.204
I'm saying don't tell him.

13:30.149 --> 13:32.696
I'm not starting at the head.
-Why don't you start with the head?

13:32.721 --> 13:34.136
I never start at the head.
-You were the one that said...

13:34.160 --> 13:35.490
I do Letulle.
-That she suffered a stroke.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.054
I start in the thoracic.
I always have and always will.

13:37.078 --> 13:39.599
So look for a cerebral haemorrhage.
-Boss...

13:41.242 --> 13:42.721
...ses.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.689
I found something on the son's CT scan.

13:51.609 --> 13:53.911
That is a bullet.

13:55.205 --> 13:57.022
Is that what killed him?

14:00.769 --> 14:05.768
The entry wound would have
been right about... here.

14:05.930 --> 14:09.689
And that is old scar tissue.

14:09.802 --> 14:12.882
So that bullet's been
in there a long time.

14:23.128 --> 14:25.447
Do you think I'll be needing
me lucky pants tonight?

14:27.425 --> 14:29.704
I don't know, play your cards right.

14:29.761 --> 14:31.177
Fucking disgusting.

14:31.270 --> 14:32.371
What do you think?

14:32.396 --> 14:34.154
I think you look like an idiot.

14:34.179 --> 14:37.378
Well, if I'm an idiot, and
you're marrying an idiot,

14:37.490 --> 14:39.979
then logically that
makes you the idiot.

14:40.182 --> 14:41.759
Well.

14:41.909 --> 14:43.865
You're really revealing
how you think about me

14:43.890 --> 14:45.409
on the day of our wedding, aren't you?

14:45.809 --> 14:48.689
Well, it's better to find
out before it's too late.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.601
It's too late.

14:58.183 --> 14:59.994
Do you still love him?

15:05.502 --> 15:10.062
I guess... a part of
me still does, yes.

15:11.350 --> 15:13.350
They found his car.

15:14.036 --> 15:15.315
In a dam.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.539
They don't know whether he
put it there or someone else.

15:17.649 --> 15:19.186
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
be telling you this.

15:19.223 --> 15:22.436
Was he in it?

15:24.429 --> 15:26.068
Some people think he might be dead.

15:26.102 --> 15:27.182
Your dad doesn't.

15:27.216 --> 15:30.374
I mean, I'm sure he
wishes he was, but...

15:30.529 --> 15:33.209
I'm sorry, you shouldn't have
to worry about any of...

16:00.016 --> 16:01.569
Are you OK?
-Hey.

16:01.655 --> 16:03.054
Yeah, sorry.

16:03.597 --> 16:05.146
What's goin' on, Fish?

16:05.229 --> 16:06.349
Where are you?

16:06.374 --> 16:07.654
Just... just wait there.

16:07.679 --> 16:09.138
I'll be there as soon as I can.

16:14.496 --> 16:15.895
That's what killed him?

16:17.317 --> 16:18.836
But...

16:22.022 --> 16:23.261
There.

16:23.370 --> 16:27.329
An entry point, just below
the ear, travelling forward.

16:27.496 --> 16:29.375
Suicide attempt?

16:29.609 --> 16:31.368
With a handgun?

16:31.456 --> 16:33.089
That's unlikely.

16:33.203 --> 16:35.529
And with a rifle, it's impossible.

16:35.638 --> 16:37.481
He couldn't have shot himself.

16:37.610 --> 16:39.081
Maybe it was an accident.

16:39.196 --> 16:41.356
He dropped a gun, discharged.

16:42.169 --> 16:46.368
Maybe, but again...
how did he not know?

16:46.928 --> 16:48.187
No.

16:48.212 --> 16:49.771
Kerrie, Glenn, Audrey.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.745
None of them owned a gun.

16:51.813 --> 16:54.368
But you already checked the
licensing register, didn't you?

16:54.490 --> 16:55.809
Yeah.

16:55.983 --> 16:57.351
So what are you thinking?

16:57.442 --> 16:59.290
That a country sergeant
just turns a blind eye

16:59.315 --> 17:01.437
to someone owning an
unregistered weapon?

17:02.309 --> 17:03.828
I was just being thorough.

17:04.010 --> 17:05.166
And you?

17:05.209 --> 17:07.647
I just like watching
her be thorough.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.809
Look down there.

17:11.076 --> 17:13.115
Word's got around
about Kerrie and Glenn.

17:13.267 --> 17:15.452
There's already a little
memorial service underway.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.801
None of you know. You got no idea.

17:17.928 --> 17:19.276
They were inseparable.

17:20.183 --> 17:21.915
So who shot him?

17:22.189 --> 17:23.907
It's hard to believe anyone would have.

17:24.089 --> 17:25.368
The whole town loved 'em both.

17:25.469 --> 17:27.313
Go on.
-Except for him.

17:27.376 --> 17:29.222
Bring in the sheep.

17:29.375 --> 17:31.130
Royce.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.519
What do you think that's about?

17:38.009 --> 17:39.288
Town drunk. Who knows?

17:39.313 --> 17:40.992
Maybe he didn't know the Mathesons.

17:41.156 --> 17:43.067
Maybe he didn't like them.

17:49.690 --> 17:51.930
Everything OK?
-Royce?

17:52.816 --> 17:54.215
Well, he used to have my job.

17:54.355 --> 17:56.274
I guess we're all susceptible?

17:56.370 --> 17:57.969
Don't mind him.

17:58.155 --> 17:59.666
Could we speak to the daughter?

18:00.789 --> 18:03.112
We're sorry to intrude.
Do you have a minute?

18:09.729 --> 18:11.408
That's ridiculous.

18:11.650 --> 18:13.342
Glenn was shot in the head?

18:13.422 --> 18:14.890
Is... is this for real?

18:17.083 --> 18:18.418
Who by?

18:19.002 --> 18:20.761
That's what we'd like to know.

18:21.010 --> 18:22.722
And wouldn't that have killed him?

18:22.890 --> 18:24.097
Normally, yes.

18:24.122 --> 18:26.961
But the projectile missed
all the major blood vessels

18:26.986 --> 18:28.120
and brain centres.

18:28.145 --> 18:29.948
It's unusual, but it happens.

18:30.515 --> 18:33.338
But if the crash killed
him, when was he shot?

18:33.409 --> 18:35.546
Years ago. Maybe decades.

18:35.571 --> 18:38.305
He would have been bleeding
quite heavily from the scalp.

18:38.636 --> 18:41.196
Do you ever remember him
coming home bleeding?

18:43.363 --> 18:47.252
When he was 13, he was
climbing the old windmill.

18:47.370 --> 18:49.642
One of the bolts has rusted through.

18:49.667 --> 18:51.526
He fell and hit his head.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.229
I was jealous 'cause Mum

18:54.254 --> 18:55.877
kept him home from
school for three weeks.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.970
But you're saying he was shot?

19:01.009 --> 19:03.248
Audrey, did Glenn have any enemies?

19:03.290 --> 19:05.209
Ex-girlfriends, boyfriends?

19:05.330 --> 19:06.795
People he owed money to?

19:06.863 --> 19:08.662
Did he have arguments?

19:08.756 --> 19:12.595
Glenn wasn't interested
in girls... or boys.

19:13.005 --> 19:14.372
Glenn was simple.

19:14.483 --> 19:15.976
He was simple before the fall

19:16.001 --> 19:18.186
and he certainly wasn't sharper after.

19:18.489 --> 19:20.408
But he was happy.

19:20.688 --> 19:26.315
He loved dogs, he loved
cake and he adored Mum.

19:26.635 --> 19:28.550
They were inseparable.

19:28.862 --> 19:30.563
No-one would have wanted to shoot him.

19:37.022 --> 19:39.141
It's quite sad that
you miss me so much.

19:39.249 --> 19:40.893
This is why I don't have a dog.

19:41.423 --> 19:44.217
I'm calling about Kerrie Matheson.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.130
Is that your ute out the front?

19:55.950 --> 19:57.587
Did you ever drive Glenn around?

19:57.669 --> 20:00.068
No. Mum insisted on doing that.

20:00.336 --> 20:03.109
I guess it made her feel like
she was protecting Glenn.

20:03.190 --> 20:05.349
Listen, I don't know
what else to tell you.

20:05.727 --> 20:08.430
Do you know why she died
yet? Was... was it a stroke?

20:08.570 --> 20:10.450
No, no stroke.

20:11.383 --> 20:14.785
Did you know that your mother
had advanced breast cancer?

20:14.810 --> 20:17.740
It had metastasised
into her lungs and liver.

20:18.489 --> 20:20.328
One more question. I'm... I'm so sorry.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.277
Your mother had something
else in her lungs.

20:23.336 --> 20:24.456
Spores.

20:24.550 --> 20:26.309
Plant spores.

20:34.562 --> 20:36.202
Her orchids.

20:37.382 --> 20:39.742
Apart from Glenn, they're
what she loved most.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.069
Thank you, Audrey.

20:52.622 --> 20:54.741
So, Kerrie Matheson
didn't have a stroke,

20:54.817 --> 20:56.724
but she did have terminal cancer.

20:56.836 --> 20:58.759
And a mentally impaired son

20:58.784 --> 21:01.463
who probably would have
been lost without her.

21:01.829 --> 21:04.082
Do you think she hit
that tree on purpose?

21:04.250 --> 21:06.946
Murder-suicide? Maybe.

21:07.589 --> 21:09.148
Orchids.

21:09.540 --> 21:12.164
"Apart from Glenn, that's
the thing she loved most."

21:12.189 --> 21:14.086
Do you think Audrey was
jealous of her brother?

21:14.171 --> 21:16.061
Enough to shoot him in the head?

21:16.393 --> 21:17.885
If she did shoot him
and didn't kill him,

21:17.910 --> 21:19.775
why didn't she finish the job?

21:22.489 --> 21:23.569
Hello?

21:23.691 --> 21:25.450
Robert Quinn's car has come up.

21:27.522 --> 21:28.881
What?

21:29.242 --> 21:31.402
The cops found his car.

21:33.143 --> 21:34.662
How do you know?

21:35.123 --> 21:37.003
I'm staring at it.

21:41.010 --> 21:42.370
I see.

21:43.049 --> 21:44.849
Why didn't you tell me?

21:46.351 --> 21:48.062
I didn't know.

21:58.582 --> 22:00.141
Everything OK?

22:00.282 --> 22:01.362
Yeah.

22:12.482 --> 22:14.962
Quinn's phone.
-Detective.

22:29.370 --> 22:32.769
So, am I walking home?

22:33.202 --> 22:35.562
Well, that's up to you.

22:39.796 --> 22:43.360
Why didn't you tell me
you'd found Quinn's car?

22:45.063 --> 22:47.511
I'm so sorry.

22:49.549 --> 22:51.548
I did not want to keep that from you.

22:51.929 --> 22:53.262
Who told you?

22:53.496 --> 22:54.869
Not Pavich?

22:55.050 --> 22:56.570
Nichols.

22:57.315 --> 22:59.434
He went to see Steph.

22:59.666 --> 23:01.315
Of course she'd tell you.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.263
So everyone knew but me?

23:04.849 --> 23:06.128
Why?

23:06.196 --> 23:09.204
Everyone thought that if
you heard about the car,

23:09.229 --> 23:10.868
you'd make it your mission.

23:11.036 --> 23:13.157
Everyone thinks you're loyal to Steph.

23:17.088 --> 23:18.843
So...

23:20.730 --> 23:23.130
what's everyone thinking?

23:23.910 --> 23:26.749
Well, either Quinn put the
car in the dam himself,

23:26.774 --> 23:28.540
or someone put it in there for him.

23:34.691 --> 23:36.095
You found the car?

23:36.170 --> 23:38.499
Yeah, and that's why I'm off the case,

23:38.589 --> 23:41.578
because I overstepped the mark.

23:45.643 --> 23:47.442
You found the car?

23:47.976 --> 23:49.416
Yeah.

24:10.969 --> 24:12.329
Evening.

24:17.296 --> 24:19.495
You haven't changed a
bit, have you, Lewison?

24:19.629 --> 24:22.130
Jeez, except for that dodgy haircut.
Did you lose a bet, mate?

24:22.189 --> 24:25.148
So nice to see you, Bryan.

24:25.316 --> 24:27.516
Yeah.
-So what's this?

24:28.903 --> 24:30.031
A shakedown?

24:30.069 --> 24:32.428
I don't do shakedowns, Lew.
-No.

24:32.817 --> 24:35.489
Hey, I heard about that
little episode you had.

24:35.956 --> 24:39.250
I would keep very fuckin'
quiet about that if I were you.

24:40.695 --> 24:42.798
So if this is not a shakedown...

24:43.762 --> 24:45.160
what is it?

24:46.029 --> 24:47.508
Robert Quinn.

24:47.586 --> 24:48.765
Who had it in for him?

24:48.790 --> 24:50.470
You got a phone book?

24:52.655 --> 24:54.134
Why?

24:54.443 --> 24:55.883
Is he dead?

24:57.903 --> 25:00.103
Shit.
-Who owed him the most?

25:02.042 --> 25:05.375
Quinn was shit at picking
winners, but he wasn't a fool.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.690
He owed a lot of people,
but as far as I know,

25:08.715 --> 25:11.903
he never owed one person more than,

25:11.928 --> 25:14.031
I don't know, a couple of grand.

25:14.504 --> 25:18.492
Never enough to break an
arm, or... let alone top him.

25:18.991 --> 25:20.828
Besides, dead men don't pay.

25:21.515 --> 25:24.675
So you're telling me he never
ripped big bucks off anyone?

25:26.589 --> 25:30.615
There was this one person, yeah.

25:35.230 --> 25:36.790
It's freezing.

25:38.909 --> 25:40.302
Did I wake you?

25:40.456 --> 25:43.495
Well, you're my hot
water bottle, so yeah.

25:44.996 --> 25:46.315
What are you looking for?

25:46.340 --> 25:47.684
I just remembered

25:47.709 --> 25:50.668
that I have something that
belonged to my husband.

25:51.309 --> 25:53.069
Should I go home?

25:54.215 --> 25:55.854
You know I was married.

25:55.956 --> 25:57.395
You know I was married.

25:57.476 --> 25:58.931
Me twice.

25:59.241 --> 26:01.051
OK, then you win on that one.

26:06.210 --> 26:08.829
My second husband...
-The cop.

26:12.370 --> 26:13.970
He really...

26:16.439 --> 26:19.434
He... hurt me.

26:19.495 --> 26:22.095
People... I don't think
people understand how much.

26:23.836 --> 26:25.355
Well, I want to know...

26:25.616 --> 26:27.976
if you wanna tell me.

26:29.896 --> 26:31.416
Sometime.

26:32.409 --> 26:33.809
But he's gone, right?

26:36.209 --> 26:38.489
So then everything's gonna be OK.

26:55.042 --> 26:56.222
I'm sorry.

26:56.276 --> 26:58.676
We missed the bus.

26:59.036 --> 27:00.796
120 bucks.

27:02.889 --> 27:04.728
We'll get another one tomorrow.

27:04.796 --> 27:06.984
What about tonight?

27:08.224 --> 27:10.090
We'll get a room.

27:11.016 --> 27:12.295
We'll run out of money.

27:12.362 --> 27:14.882
We only need enough for another ticket.

27:20.976 --> 27:22.537
Where'd you go?

27:51.945 --> 27:53.701
Where's your sister?

27:53.796 --> 27:55.668
She's down visiting Mum.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.409
Nephew?

28:02.796 --> 28:04.156
Son.

28:05.306 --> 28:06.506
Peter.

28:06.670 --> 28:08.108
Where is he?

28:08.641 --> 28:10.038
In Melbourne.

28:12.176 --> 28:13.656
With his father?

28:16.536 --> 28:18.176
Aneurysm.

28:23.930 --> 28:26.015
Like a bullet in the brain.

28:31.930 --> 28:33.410
Sorry.

29:29.370 --> 29:30.729
It's late.

29:31.189 --> 29:33.109
Fern called.

29:33.942 --> 29:36.068
She told me about Quinn's car.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.668
Nichols told me not to tell you.

29:39.269 --> 29:40.708
And you didn't.

29:40.863 --> 29:42.618
How does knowing about
Rob's car help you?

29:42.643 --> 29:43.726
What can you do?

29:46.755 --> 29:48.430
What do you think they're gonna do?

29:48.455 --> 29:50.019
The police?

29:50.816 --> 29:52.335
They'll just keep going.

29:52.946 --> 29:54.815
They won't stop now until they know

29:54.840 --> 29:57.489
whether Robert is alive or dead.

29:57.729 --> 29:59.584
And if he's dead,

29:59.894 --> 30:02.729
they won't stop until
someone's charged.

30:02.816 --> 30:04.667
What should I do?

30:07.263 --> 30:08.822
How do you feel about it?

30:09.269 --> 30:11.349
I'm glad they found it.

30:14.150 --> 30:15.948
Is Fern OK?

30:16.080 --> 30:18.210
I hardly know her anymore, so...

30:19.503 --> 30:21.383
Dan, I've gotta go.

31:08.930 --> 31:10.296
Slide over.

31:29.490 --> 31:33.330
I saw you here yesterday with
our lovely Senior Sergeant.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.429
You and your pretty friend.

31:37.316 --> 31:39.355
Pegged her as Forensics.

31:39.650 --> 31:41.369
Not sure about you.

31:41.645 --> 31:42.982
Morgue.

31:43.132 --> 31:44.809
Pathologist.

31:44.882 --> 31:46.562
You're a long way from home.

31:50.323 --> 31:53.123
This... is that Holly, isn't it?

31:55.962 --> 31:57.845
And this is you.

31:59.676 --> 32:02.205
You were the sergeant here
when Holly went missing.

32:03.603 --> 32:05.513
Why didn't you go into the church

32:05.551 --> 32:07.718
for Glenn and Kerrie yesterday?

32:07.850 --> 32:09.449
Everyone loved them.

32:09.636 --> 32:10.956
Except you.

32:14.315 --> 32:17.474
I found a bullet in Glenn's brain.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.969
It had been there a long time.

32:21.463 --> 32:23.486
You know who might have shot him?

32:26.681 --> 32:29.355
Like you say, everyone loved them.

32:30.015 --> 32:33.106
Like I say, except you.

32:38.529 --> 32:41.936
I was the cop here
when Glenn was a kid.

32:42.955 --> 32:46.994
Around that time, there was a
string of animals found dead.

32:47.650 --> 32:49.048
Mutilated.

32:49.264 --> 32:50.689
Cats.

32:50.869 --> 32:53.069
A sheep. Stray dogs.

32:53.969 --> 32:55.969
You didn't catch anyone?
-No.

32:56.789 --> 33:00.469
But it all stopped after Glenn
Matheson hit his head at the farm.

33:03.656 --> 33:06.549
Thing is, two weeks ago,

33:06.866 --> 33:09.785
I was in behind the showground,

33:09.982 --> 33:11.848
and I found bones.

33:12.009 --> 33:13.569
Dog bones.

33:13.823 --> 33:15.223
Burned.

33:16.396 --> 33:19.186
Another stray got doused with petrol,

33:20.390 --> 33:22.684
just like 20 years ago.

33:27.289 --> 33:30.809
What's that got to do
with Holly Ostwald?

33:32.623 --> 33:34.470
What happened to her?

33:36.963 --> 33:38.873
I don't know.

33:41.195 --> 33:44.635
The person to ask would
be her best friend.

33:50.290 --> 33:52.530
I want to know about Holly Ostwald.

33:54.622 --> 33:56.461
Holly was a friend at school,

33:56.570 --> 33:58.245
and one day, she vanished.

33:58.283 --> 33:59.352
Why?

33:59.468 --> 34:01.105
Do you know what happened to her?

34:03.309 --> 34:04.669
No.

34:05.529 --> 34:06.999
Did your mother know?

34:07.024 --> 34:08.339
Or Glenn?

34:10.983 --> 34:12.237
What happened to your neck?

34:12.297 --> 34:13.976
I'm calling the police.

34:53.469 --> 34:55.789
No. No.

35:29.642 --> 35:32.219
Guess we're both getting
pretty good at sneaking out.

35:32.349 --> 35:33.788
I didn't want to wake you.

35:33.942 --> 35:35.142
Wake me.

35:36.322 --> 35:37.961
I got your message.

35:38.056 --> 35:39.916
Audrey Matheson did report

35:39.941 --> 35:41.609
a minor accident in her utility

35:41.634 --> 35:42.834
five weeks ago.

35:42.977 --> 35:44.415
What's this about?

35:44.556 --> 35:45.916
Look at this.

35:50.409 --> 35:51.848
That was 20 years ago.

35:51.930 --> 35:53.315
Exactly.

35:53.543 --> 35:55.455
Now look at this.

35:57.182 --> 36:00.844
Here is where we found
the bullet, and this.

36:01.077 --> 36:03.012
Scar tissue. The route
the bullet travelled.

36:03.063 --> 36:04.502
Old scar tissue.

36:04.882 --> 36:06.362
20 years old?

36:07.502 --> 36:09.667
And what's that? That's
scar tissue too, isn't it?

36:09.769 --> 36:12.469
Yes. Recent scar tissue.

36:12.523 --> 36:14.802
About a month or two old.

36:15.523 --> 36:18.723
So, the bullet moved
a month or two ago?

36:18.935 --> 36:22.189
And Audrey had a minor bingle

36:22.214 --> 36:24.572
in her ute five weeks ago.

36:26.709 --> 36:29.679
So... the bullet shifted
and didn't kill him.

36:29.762 --> 36:31.081
No.

36:31.746 --> 36:34.267
The bullet is in his frontal lobe,

36:34.336 --> 36:37.015
the part of the brain
that affects personality.

36:37.106 --> 36:39.155
I think when that bullet shifted

36:39.180 --> 36:40.665
about a month or two ago,

36:40.868 --> 36:43.369
Glenn's personality changed.

36:43.678 --> 36:46.096
Changed how?
-Changed back.

36:48.983 --> 36:51.655
Don't let Fairley see you
working on one of his patients.

36:51.742 --> 36:53.128
I'm not, you are.

36:53.153 --> 36:54.188
Her lungs are over there.

36:54.213 --> 36:56.288
I need to know more about those spores.

37:30.090 --> 37:31.569
I can't help you.

37:32.209 --> 37:33.529
You can.

37:36.162 --> 37:38.124
I looked up Glenn Matheson's records.

37:38.149 --> 37:41.468
You arrested him age
12 for animal cruelty

37:41.810 --> 37:43.276
but you never charged him.

37:43.450 --> 37:44.803
Kerrie covered for him.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.655
I looked up your records too.

37:46.789 --> 37:49.588
You were in charge of
the weapons buyback.

37:49.784 --> 37:52.802
You let Kerrie Matheson keep her .22

37:52.875 --> 37:54.875
when she should have
got a licence for it.

37:56.010 --> 37:57.410
Why?

37:59.402 --> 38:02.081
Why does any idiot break
the rules for a woman?

38:02.942 --> 38:04.782
I loved her.

38:05.383 --> 38:07.262
I let her keep it on one condition.

38:07.410 --> 38:08.850
That she use it?

38:10.383 --> 38:13.262
There was no accident
at the farm, was there?

38:13.530 --> 38:15.130
Glenn didn't hit his head.

38:16.103 --> 38:19.463
His mother shot him because of the
animals and because of Holly.

38:23.650 --> 38:25.209
Where is Holly?

38:25.456 --> 38:28.536
The only person who knew for
sure was shot in the head.

38:29.262 --> 38:31.227
And his memory went with it.

38:56.429 --> 38:58.212
Dr Harrow. Craig Yellowly.

38:58.256 --> 39:00.495
Yes, I can see you, Yellowly.

39:00.636 --> 39:01.807
Yeah.

39:01.869 --> 39:03.588
Technology.

39:04.066 --> 39:08.356
Now, listen, I received a
call about those spores.

39:08.514 --> 39:11.095
Congratulations. That is...
that is quite a rare find.

39:11.214 --> 39:13.877
Now, speaking of which...
hello there, Sergeant Dass.

39:14.596 --> 39:17.134
The spores?
-Yes.

39:17.606 --> 39:19.891
Stropharia aurantiaca.

39:20.003 --> 39:21.270
Scarlet Roundhead.

39:21.295 --> 39:24.102
It's a New Zealand mushroom
that's not common here at all.

39:25.382 --> 39:27.421
Well, how would Kerrie
Matheson have them?

39:27.503 --> 39:31.522
Well, I... I suppose spores
could travel with other rare plants,

39:31.623 --> 39:34.099
lilies, ferns, orchids.

39:34.182 --> 39:36.142
Alright. Send me an invoice.

39:48.262 --> 39:50.501
She's not here. Car's gone.

39:50.650 --> 39:53.182
I'm going to go into town,
see if I can find the sergeant.

39:53.330 --> 39:55.129
You wait here.

39:55.276 --> 39:56.950
See if she comes back.

40:00.376 --> 40:01.712
Daniel?

40:02.122 --> 40:04.042
Just wait here, OK?

41:42.229 --> 41:44.269
Holly.

41:47.949 --> 41:49.509
Did you know she was here?

41:50.375 --> 41:53.494
Mum always said, "Don't
go in the orchid house."

41:53.690 --> 41:57.282
That was her private
space, and now I know why.

42:06.722 --> 42:07.888
And I knew.

42:08.175 --> 42:09.895
About Glenn.

42:12.709 --> 42:14.469
From when we were little.

42:16.203 --> 42:17.876
From when I came home from school

42:17.902 --> 42:20.021
and found my dead mouse.

42:20.250 --> 42:24.010
After that, Mum never
left me alone with him.

42:24.829 --> 42:27.624
But he would still get out and do...

42:29.542 --> 42:31.022
bad things.

42:32.456 --> 42:34.416
Mum tried to get help for him.

42:35.322 --> 42:39.722
I... I guess she hoped he'd
just stop, but he didn't stop.

42:41.775 --> 42:43.295
He kept going.

42:45.462 --> 42:47.070
And then he saw Holly.

42:57.776 --> 43:00.855
I knew when Holly went
missing that it was Glenn,

43:01.342 --> 43:03.769
but I never knew he killed
her on the property.

43:06.609 --> 43:09.408
I found Mum one night in the kitchen.

43:09.829 --> 43:11.549
She looked...

43:12.469 --> 43:13.989
so tired.

43:15.754 --> 43:18.127
She told me no matter what I heard

43:18.152 --> 43:19.592
to stay in bed.

43:20.969 --> 43:22.957
I didn't know what she
was going to do until...

43:26.749 --> 43:28.347
The next morning...

43:31.522 --> 43:34.042
everything changed.

43:35.329 --> 43:36.809
Glenn changed.

43:38.963 --> 43:41.522
The devil became the angel.

43:41.878 --> 43:43.246
I guess Mum figured,

43:43.271 --> 43:46.114
what was the point in
having him arrested?

43:46.776 --> 43:49.411
She tried to kill him and in return

43:49.436 --> 43:52.559
got this simple, beautiful boy.

43:53.368 --> 43:56.408
What was the point in telling anyone?

43:58.309 --> 43:59.949
Holly's family.

44:02.216 --> 44:04.072
We said he hit his head.

44:06.589 --> 44:10.869
And everyone fell in love
with the new Glenn, even Mum.

44:11.929 --> 44:14.009
But she never left me
alone with him again.

44:15.362 --> 44:19.241
Until her car broke down
a couple of months ago.

44:19.429 --> 44:21.429
I offered to pick Glenn up from...

44:22.409 --> 44:24.621
from the bakery and I...

44:30.802 --> 44:32.441
I had an accident.

44:40.009 --> 44:41.649
And then he changed?

44:45.196 --> 44:46.516
And this?

44:53.422 --> 44:55.062
Get off. Get off.

45:05.995 --> 45:07.570
That's when Mum knew she had to finish

45:07.595 --> 45:09.872
what she started 20 years ago.

45:11.202 --> 45:13.041
I knew about the cancer.

45:13.682 --> 45:16.202
I think that made it easier.

45:20.775 --> 45:24.330
She sacrificed herself
because she loved her child.

45:24.770 --> 45:27.791
Guess there's something
laudable in that.

45:28.002 --> 45:29.962
She also hid a murder.

45:30.543 --> 45:32.768
Yeah, well, that is unforgiveable.

45:35.956 --> 45:38.675
Nevertheless, it's fascinating.

45:39.050 --> 45:40.558
Frontal lobe injury

45:40.583 --> 45:43.782
resulting in dramatic changes
to social behaviour,

45:43.942 --> 45:46.570
IQ, sexual interests,

45:46.610 --> 45:48.929
but then... then a second change?

45:49.396 --> 45:51.762
You should write a paper.
-Publish?

45:51.831 --> 45:54.092
No, I think I'll leave publishing

45:54.117 --> 45:55.893
for those who want to work in Geneva.

45:56.090 --> 45:58.182
When were you going to tell me?

45:58.289 --> 45:59.744
When it concerns you.

45:59.782 --> 46:00.942
So you don't think it does?

46:00.967 --> 46:03.125
It's not your business, Daniel.

46:03.150 --> 46:04.270
And believe it or not,

46:04.295 --> 46:07.224
not every decision is made
for the greater good.

46:07.269 --> 46:09.010
And when were you going to
tell me about Quinn's car?

46:09.035 --> 46:11.476
Keeping that from me was
for the greater good?

46:12.642 --> 46:14.075
Yes.

46:15.096 --> 46:17.735
Don't you trust me?
-Of course I trust you.

46:17.934 --> 46:19.851
But what good does knowing do for you?

46:19.876 --> 46:20.924
What if Quinn is dead?

46:20.949 --> 46:23.954
What if the bones you've been
banging on about are Quinn's?

46:24.050 --> 46:27.250
He was a bad egg, and we
all warned Steph about him.

46:28.142 --> 46:29.901
Look, it is what it is.

46:30.133 --> 46:31.877
And if Quinn is dead, then you know

46:31.902 --> 46:33.442
that Bryan will find the killer.

46:33.495 --> 46:36.075
You just need to sit tight
and keep doing your work.

46:54.662 --> 46:55.982
Here we go.

46:59.749 --> 47:01.702
The 11:45 bus

47:01.727 --> 47:04.613
to Gold Coast is leaving from Bay 14.

47:15.490 --> 47:16.850
Seriously?

47:18.563 --> 47:20.082
I can't go yet.

47:20.162 --> 47:21.322
Why?

47:23.789 --> 47:25.988
I... I have some things
I need to find out.

47:26.429 --> 47:27.789
What?

47:29.063 --> 47:30.263
What?

47:31.810 --> 47:33.170
Don't tell me.

47:33.990 --> 47:35.542
<i>You can't tell me.</i>

47:36.329 --> 47:38.849
Cal, I'm so sorry.
-Fish...

47:40.963 --> 47:42.494
you know I love you...

47:44.089 --> 47:46.369
but you still can't tell
me what's going on.

47:52.296 --> 47:53.576
Here.

47:55.026 --> 47:56.186
What?

47:56.291 --> 47:59.090
Like you say, I won't
need it once I'm there.

48:00.836 --> 48:02.995
No, no, Cal, just wait a few days.

48:03.020 --> 48:04.259
I can't.

48:57.450 --> 48:58.769
Hi.

48:59.589 --> 49:01.469
Harrow.

49:03.176 --> 49:04.770
Bloody shame Quinn's parents are dead.

49:04.795 --> 49:07.175
We'd have the DNA sorted
and we'd know for sure.

49:08.162 --> 49:09.401
You're on the case?

49:09.490 --> 49:10.849
Now his car's up.

49:10.950 --> 49:12.843
You and Dass?

49:12.954 --> 49:14.543
You're bloody terriers.

49:14.778 --> 49:16.508
I thought I wasn't supposed to know.

49:16.616 --> 49:19.809
Yeah. Nah. Well, Maxine
said you worked it out.

49:19.889 --> 49:21.288
Hey, listen, tell me,

49:21.456 --> 49:24.496
how much do you think his
wedding band was worth?

49:31.730 --> 49:33.009
I don't know.

49:33.082 --> 49:34.681
You'd have to ask Steph.

49:34.850 --> 49:36.682
Men's wedding band?

49:36.882 --> 49:38.561
I'd say no more than a grand.

49:38.776 --> 49:40.289
Yeah, agreed.

49:40.549 --> 49:42.629
Hardly worth the trouble
of cutting it off.

49:43.602 --> 49:45.321
You know, that might not be Quinn.

49:46.850 --> 49:48.705
Right, we're diving again.

49:48.984 --> 49:50.694
If we find that skull...

49:50.729 --> 49:52.209
it'll be a done deal.

49:55.349 --> 49:57.468
I'd best away.

49:57.503 --> 50:00.342
Good work on keeping these.

50:00.629 --> 50:02.709
We're gonna nail this one.

50:04.643 --> 50:06.238
Nichols.

50:21.410 --> 50:22.589
Hey, Bryan.

50:22.649 --> 50:23.689
G'day, Nick.

50:23.770 --> 50:25.248
You found his phone, hey?

50:25.516 --> 50:27.555
Yeah, and got a warrant
for his voicemails.

50:27.730 --> 50:30.721
Now, we found a message on
Quinn's phone October the 2nd,

50:30.746 --> 50:33.229
which is the day before his
car went into the dam.

50:33.442 --> 50:35.162
It's from Steph Tolson.

50:37.163 --> 50:38.242
Hi. This is Rob.

50:38.296 --> 50:39.496
Sorry I can't talk.

50:39.521 --> 50:41.727
Leave a message, and I
promise I'll call you back.

50:42.327 --> 50:43.628
Fucking arsehole.

50:43.653 --> 50:44.809
That's it. I warned you.

50:44.834 --> 50:47.694
Now when I find you, I'm
going to fucking kill you.

51:04.900 --> 51:06.739
Next on Harrow...

51:06.799 --> 51:09.635
Am I under surveillance?
-We know you went and saw Steph.

51:09.712 --> 51:11.821
Did she say or do anything
to make you think

51:11.859 --> 51:13.738
she was involved in
Quinn's disappearance?

51:13.787 --> 51:17.067
The divers found a skull. It's Quinn's.

51:17.827 --> 51:20.077
Rhys Weir, member of the rowing squad.

51:20.153 --> 51:22.792
Unfortunately, Rhys lost
the single sculls event.

51:23.033 --> 51:25.067
Not quite the tight crew I expected.

51:25.093 --> 51:26.826
You still angry about
Rhys losing that race?

51:26.851 --> 51:28.152
Yeah, I am.

51:28.193 --> 51:31.167
We're asking all the boys that
were with Rhys the night he died

51:31.192 --> 51:33.672
to provide a saliva
swab for DNA testing.
