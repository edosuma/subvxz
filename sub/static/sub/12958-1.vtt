Don't give me any of this
"slow metabolism", "it's my glands" crap.

because they eat the wrong food.

Real careful, cos you don't want
to scare me into lying my head off.

01:12:40.183 --> 01:12:43.350
So you have to say
how you've experimented.

01:12:45.892 --> 01:12:48.600
Then once you've sucked up
that entire bottle of wine,

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:53.558
you can go all gooey-eyed and say how
nice it is to spend quality time together.

01:12:53.558 --> 01:12:56.975
You can scooch over
and put your arm around my shoulder,

01:12:56.975 --> 01:12:59.142
give it a little squeeze.

And you know why we couldn't find him?

01:19:25.558 --> 01:19:29.058
Because Snuffles has gone

the drain stuff out?

It was Kevin. Kevin did it.

So, Kev, erm... Mom had something
that she wanted to tell you.

And...

01:23:40.267 --> 01:23:45.767
...I was concerned that
you might be feeling responsible.

01:23:47.142 --> 01:23:48.850
Why's that?

01:23:50.267 --> 01:23:52.725
Because you were supposed
to be looking after her.

01:23:52.725 --> 01:23:55.392
We just don't want you
to blame yourself.

01:23:55.392 --> 01:23:57.642
No, I don't.

01:23:57.642 --> 01:23:59.975
I mean, I never said I did.

01:24:00.725 --> 01:24:03.558
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.

01:24:03.558 --> 01:24:06.933
So we would appreciate
you looking out for her.

01:24:06.933 --> 01:24:09.058
Any name calling...

01:24:11.225 --> 01:24:15.225
You don't really remember
being a kid much, do you, Dad?

01:24:15.225 --> 01:24:17.975
Celia's just gonna have to suck it up.

01:24:25.058 --> 01:24:27.808
I thought you didn't like those.

01:24:27.808 --> 01:24:31.058
Yeah, well, they're...
What do you call it?

01:24:33.892 --> 01:24:36.475
An acquired taste.

01:25:33.475 --> 01:25:36.100
Sorry, honey. I'm so sorry.

01:25:43.808 --> 01:25:46.017
There you go.

01:25:50.558 --> 01:25:52.100
OK.

01:25:57.058 --> 01:25:59.142
Thank you, Mommy.

01:26:12.892 --> 01:26:15.017
Hey, kiddo. More practice?

01:26:15.017 --> 01:26:18.308
Yeah, you know it. Hey, Celie,
you want to come collect arrows?

01:26:18.308 --> 01:26:20.017
No!

01:26:25.975 --> 01:26:27.683
Thanks, sweetie.

01:26:41.683 --> 01:26:45.142
So... what do you want to do?

01:26:52.392 --> 01:26:55.475
We'll last out the school year
if we can, and...

01:26:56.975 --> 01:26:59.433
...make arrangements
over the summer.

01:27:02.683 --> 01:27:06.058
At least custody is a no-brainer.

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.308
Is it?

01:27:12.142 --> 01:27:14.058
You've decided.

01:27:16.142 --> 01:27:18.850
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.

01:27:20.975 --> 01:27:23.308
It already happened.

01:27:34.433 --> 01:27:36.683

01:27:36.683 --> 01:27:38.850
Hey, Kev.

01:27:40.225 --> 01:27:43.808
Listen, buddy, it's easy
to misunderstand something

01:27:43.808 --> 01:27:46.350
when you hear it out of context.

01:27:49.392 --> 01:27:52.267
Why would I not know the context?

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:56.517
I am the context.

01:28:13.725 --> 01:28:16.558
You have to appeal.
Paying costs is punitive.

01:28:16.558 --> 01:28:19.267
- No.
- You'll lose your business, your house.

01:28:19.267 --> 01:28:21.600
I hate the house. I always have.

- Parcel for Kevin Khatcha... dourian?

01:28:45.892 --> 01:28:47.642
Dourian, right.

01:28:53.058 --> 01:28:54.600
Careful, it's heavy.

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:56.308
- It is?
- Yeah.

01:28:58.017 --> 01:29:00.475
- You have a nice day.
- You too.

01:29:28.475 --> 01:29:31.350
What are they for?
You never ride your bike.

01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:34.683
I got these for a song off the web.

01:29:34.683 --> 01:29:37.475
I'm gonna make a bundle
selling them at school.

01:29:38.183 --> 01:29:40.558
Next Donald Trump, huh?

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:15.683
Come with me.
Come with me.

01:30:15.683 --> 01:30:18.058
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:22.475
I'll take you back to my ship.

'Yes, I did.'

01:32:19.808 --> 01:32:22.642
'All right.
You can have some toast.'

01:32:28.933 --> 01:32:32.725
You're a little clammy.
You feeling OK?

01:32:32.725 --> 01:32:34.683
Never better.

01:32:36.517 --> 01:32:40.975
Hey, only three days to go
till you're 16, huh?

01:32:40.975 --> 01:32:43.725
We should do something.
How about Sunday?

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:47.850
Dunno. Might be tied up.

01:32:49.683 --> 01:32:53.183
Clean up some of this mess,
and then get dressed and go.

01:32:53.183 --> 01:32:55.433
- I don't wanna go to school.
- I know.

01:32:55.433 --> 01:32:59.683
But Daddy has to take a shower,
and we have to go. Say goodbye.

01:33:07.892 --> 01:33:12.475
'Franklin? Do you think we could
make some time to talk later.'

01:33:12.475 --> 01:33:17.475
'Just the two of us without the kids?
I really wanna work this thing out.'

01:33:18.767 --> 01:33:21.725
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?

01:33:59.183 --> 01:34:02.808

Pick up the goddamned phone!'
