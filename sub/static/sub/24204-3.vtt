WEBVTT

00:04.290 --> 00:05.666
Previously on Siren...

00:06.920 --> 00:08.319
[screaming]

00:08.330 --> 00:10.286
[Maddie]
God, what happened?

00:10.290 --> 00:11.530
[Ben] Kind of hard
to believe someone

00:11.540 --> 00:12.916
when they tell you
they just saw a...

00:12.920 --> 00:14.740
-Mermaid, yeah.
-There's something else.

00:14.750 --> 00:16.160
The military came
and took Chris.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.575
[Chris] Where am I?

00:19.580 --> 00:21.741
Your ancestor lost his mind.

00:21.750 --> 00:24.412
He and his shipmates slaughtered
those beautiful creatures.

00:24.420 --> 00:25.990
What really happened
back then?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.036
Why the sudden interest
in the family history?

00:29.290 --> 00:30.746
Look.

00:30.750 --> 00:32.991
There's another one?
Sisters.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.161
Is that who
you're looking for?

00:35.170 --> 00:36.376
We're ready
for extraction?

00:36.380 --> 00:38.280
[screaming]

00:38.290 --> 00:40.747
Whoever did this had to be of
substantial size and strength.

00:40.750 --> 00:41.819
Everything okay?

00:41.830 --> 00:42.990
Things are fine.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.615
Just a case I'm working on.

00:44.620 --> 00:48.329
In their natural state,
they see you as prey.

00:48.330 --> 00:50.787
Their instinct is to kill.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.031
[music playing]

01:00.830 --> 01:01.910
Hey.

01:03.830 --> 01:04.990
Hey, baby.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.911
You're up early.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.616
Yeah. I couldn't sleep.

01:29.830 --> 01:32.242
[Ben] They were some
pretty gruesome photos we saw

01:32.250 --> 01:33.740
at your dad's.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.241
Maybe we're jumping
to conclusions.

01:36.250 --> 01:39.378
A bear could have
killed that guy.

01:39.380 --> 01:41.416
When was
the last time a bear

01:41.420 --> 01:43.820
climbed into a car
and threw a 200-pound man

01:43.830 --> 01:45.457
straight out a windshield?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.450
We should get
to Miss Hawkins'.

01:48.460 --> 01:50.030
Yeah.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.611
She almost killed you
in the water.

01:58.620 --> 02:01.498
My dad found non-human blood.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.740
If she was
in that guy's car,

02:02.750 --> 02:06.072
I think we both know
who killed him.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.913
This is
Kermit the Frog speaking
from The Muppet Theater.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.706
Uh, listen, I need
to hire a bunch of spies

02:10.710 --> 02:12.166
for a closing number.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.610
Where did you go
last night?

02:22.620 --> 02:26.613
Outside in the dark?

02:26.620 --> 02:28.451
Night.

02:28.460 --> 02:30.416
Yes.
Where did you go?

02:34.040 --> 02:35.246
Huh?

02:36.960 --> 02:38.200
[sighs]

02:41.880 --> 02:44.246
[Decker]
Fully paralyzed rodents,

02:44.250 --> 02:45.877
Study Group 1A.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.917
They receive 30 ccs
in a 12-hour cycle

02:48.920 --> 02:50.535
from the thalassic
specnmen only.

02:50.540 --> 02:53.418
In the second group,
we're gonna mix her DNA

02:53.420 --> 02:55.411
with human DNA,
per my instructions.

02:55.420 --> 02:57.456
And then lastly,

02:57.460 --> 02:58.495
is our control group.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.456
We'll increase the dosage

03:00.460 --> 03:01.996
if the white blood cell
count changes.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.413
What is it you think
we'll see?

03:05.420 --> 03:07.115
Probably
a lot of dead rats.

03:16.580 --> 03:18.571
[phone dings and vibrates]

03:28.460 --> 03:29.950
-Hey!
-Xander, what the hell?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.279
I gotta talk to you.

03:31.290 --> 03:32.666
-Get out!
-Seriously, Xan!

03:32.670 --> 03:33.705
I'm not kiddin'!
It's important!

03:33.710 --> 03:34.779
Get out, you perv!

03:34.790 --> 03:35.825
You get out, Janine!

03:35.830 --> 03:36.910
Xander, man,
what the hell?

03:36.920 --> 03:39.115
I got a text from Chris.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.701
[placid high-pitched calls]

03:49.460 --> 03:51.530
What does it mean?

03:51.540 --> 03:53.326
There's one thing S.O.S. means.
He's in deep shit.

03:53.330 --> 03:54.536
-Whose number is that?
-No clue.

03:54.540 --> 03:56.826
There's only one way
to find out.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.661
No. You gotta go, Janine.
We got stuff to do.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.991
-Go screw yourself.
-Yeah, would ifI could.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.115
My jacket?

04:02.120 --> 04:03.747
I'll call you.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.206
Yeah, don't bother.

04:05.210 --> 04:06.495
[Xander]
Okay, thanks. Bye.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.661
Really, man?

04:09.670 --> 04:11.820
We gotta find out
whose phone Chris texted from.

04:14.460 --> 04:17.111
[line ringing]

04:17.120 --> 04:18.109
It's voicemail.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.701
He just texted.

04:19.710 --> 04:20.870
Maybe he had to turn
the phone off

04:20.880 --> 04:22.700
or the battery died.

04:22.710 --> 04:25.577
Hi. This is Donna Stevenson.
Please leave a message.

04:25.580 --> 04:27.616
-[beeps]
-Who the hell's
Donna Stevenson?

04:27.620 --> 04:29.030
[Ben]
Is she doing okay?

04:29.040 --> 04:30.610
She's restless as hell.

04:30.620 --> 04:33.703
She went out last night.

04:33.710 --> 04:35.496
God knows where.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.660
[lamp clicking]

04:36.670 --> 04:38.615
We need to ask her
some questions.

04:38.620 --> 04:40.781
They found a body.

04:40.790 --> 04:42.576
Where?

04:42.580 --> 04:44.491
-[phone chimes]
-Out_side of town
In a car.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.910
It's Xander.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.535
He got a lead on Chris.

04:47.540 --> 04:48.780
They're gonna try
to find him.

04:48.790 --> 04:51.167
-The missing fisherman.
-Yeah.

04:51.170 --> 04:53.115
The military medevaced
him off the North Star.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.372
The military?!
How do they know about this?

05:06.540 --> 05:08.667
[flies buzzing]

05:19.120 --> 05:20.747
Yeah, that's great news.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.411
All right, bye.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.206
[phone beeps]

05:24.210 --> 05:25.746
Xander got a text
from Chris.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.456
He's gonna try
and track the phone number.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.997
If he gets a hit,
we'll meet up,
follow the trail.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.035
Okay.

05:31.040 --> 05:34.783
Sister. Now we look.

05:34.790 --> 05:37.111
Ryn, Ryn? Stop.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.997
-Please?
-[sharp breath]

05:39.000 --> 05:41.457
We have to ask you
some questions, okay?

05:41.460 --> 05:44.452
When you first came here,
looking for your sister,

05:44.460 --> 05:46.576
did you get in a car
with a man?

05:46.580 --> 05:49.617
-[exhales]
-A car.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.201
A man in a car?

05:51.210 --> 05:52.199
We go.

05:52.210 --> 05:53.700
[sharp breath]

05:53.710 --> 05:55.200
Ryn, this is important!

05:55.210 --> 05:57.531
-Yaah!
-[He|en] Ryn, no!

05:57.540 --> 05:59.576
Maddie? Maddie?

05:59.580 --> 06:00.706
Maddie, are you
okay?

06:00.710 --> 06:01.779
Are you okay?

06:01.790 --> 06:03.667
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:03.670 --> 06:06.491
Ryn, you can't hurt people!

06:06.500 --> 06:08.286
Okay?
You're stronger than us.

06:08.290 --> 06:09.746
You're very strong.

06:15.290 --> 06:16.996
[winces]

06:19.080 --> 06:22.072
You don't know
what you're dealing with.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.917
[Xander] There she is.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.205
Donna Stevenson,
lives in Bremerton.

06:33.210 --> 06:34.666
Oh, yeah.

06:34.670 --> 06:36.706
Says she's
a registered nurse.

06:36.710 --> 06:37.779
I'll get the address.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.786
Right. Got it.
Let's go.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.535
[Ben]
You sure you're okay?

06:45.540 --> 06:47.326
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
-All right.

06:47.330 --> 06:49.707
This is what I've
been trying to tell you.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.280
This will end very badly.

06:51.290 --> 06:54.999
You need to find
her sister quickly

06:55.000 --> 06:57.116
and get them both
back into the water

06:57.120 --> 06:59.918
before it's too late.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.491
Look, Miss Hawkins,
we appreciate your concern,

07:02.500 --> 07:04.661
really we do,

07:04.670 --> 07:08.959
but you're applying some
crazy fictional mythology

07:08.960 --> 07:10.951
to a scientific discovery.

07:10.960 --> 07:15.613
I mean, there
is another species
on this planet,

07:15.620 --> 07:17.702
one that we can
communicate With.

07:17.710 --> 07:19.371
That's the problem
right there.

07:19.380 --> 07:21.416
She's a species to you.

07:21.420 --> 07:23.706
There's way more
to the world than science.

07:23.710 --> 07:24.870
You should know that.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.950
You were raised
by a Haida man.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.167
Those are made up stories.

07:29.170 --> 07:32.207
Don't you ever let
your step-father
hear you say that.

07:32.210 --> 07:36.749
And you,
just like your ancestors,

07:36.750 --> 07:40.117
refusing to acknowledge
your past,

07:40.120 --> 07:41.667
destined to repeat it.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.116
I'm gonna open my store.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.953
Whatever you do,
don't leave her alone

07:46.960 --> 07:49.076
and don't make her angry.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.160
[sighs]

07:50.170 --> 07:52.320
[door opens]

07:54.120 --> 07:56.372
Morning.

07:56.380 --> 07:57.779
Hello, Sheriff.

07:57.790 --> 07:59.781
Just had a few questions
if you don't mind.

07:59.790 --> 08:00.825
Did you find that girl?

08:00.830 --> 08:02.161
The one who threw
the pole at me?

08:02.170 --> 08:04.456
Uh, not yet.

08:04.460 --> 08:06.576
Opioids.
Damn epidemic.

08:06.580 --> 08:07.706
Yes, it is.

08:07.710 --> 08:09.029
Does this look familiar?

08:11.080 --> 08:12.661
It's my daughter's
sweatshirt,

08:12.670 --> 08:13.819
the one she stole
off the line.

08:13.830 --> 08:16.742
-Mmm.
-That blood?

08:16.750 --> 08:19.412
It's possible
this girl's involved
in something more criminal.

08:19.420 --> 08:21.115
Any chance of you coming
down to the station

08:21.120 --> 08:23.281
and helping us piece
together a description?

08:23.290 --> 08:25.326
Well, you know I will.
Just grab my purse.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.740
All right.

08:28.790 --> 08:30.246
Look, Ryn?

08:32.290 --> 08:34.667
Now, you're very smart.

08:34.670 --> 08:39.209
Okay, so I'm gonna try
and explain something to you.

08:40.750 --> 08:43.992
Your sister
could be anywhere,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.286
maybe very far from here.

08:46.290 --> 08:48.827
It's gonna be very difficult
to find her,

08:48.830 --> 08:51.116
but we are going to try.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.918
Our friend Xander,
he's looking.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.911
Maybe he'll find something.

09:01.920 --> 09:05.788
If he finds our friend,
he may know where
your sister is.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.740
Okay.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.035
Yes.

09:11.040 --> 09:15.409
Now, in the meantime,

09:15.420 --> 09:19.493
we would like to know
more about you.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.377
To learn.

09:21.380 --> 09:23.530
[Maddie]
Like last night,

09:23.540 --> 09:25.030
you asked me questions.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.877
I learn.

09:30.880 --> 09:31.949
[Ben] Yes.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.746
So will you

09:33.750 --> 09:35.286
come with us

09:35.290 --> 09:38.828
to our rescue center
so that we can learn?

09:38.830 --> 09:40.878
About you.

09:40.880 --> 09:45.453
I will go,

09:45.460 --> 09:48.281
then we find sister.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.536
[door opens]

10:04.670 --> 10:07.742
Morning, hon.

10:07.750 --> 10:10.071
We have tickets
to the theater on the 16th.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.071
-[Ted] Ah, the theater
-Mm-hmm.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.036
_ Wouldn't_missit_. _
HopIng for two IntermISSIons.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.110
Ha. I'll see if_I can
arrange It.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.200
Breakfast?

10:17.210 --> 10:18.529
Uh, no, thanks, Sylvia.

10:18.540 --> 10:20.872
I'm gonna grab something
on the way in.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.199
Thank you, Syl.

10:22.210 --> 10:24.531
I was thinking about
doing my benefit
for the clinic

10:24.540 --> 10:27.168
on Tuesday
the following week.

10:27.170 --> 10:28.535
-Sounds fine.
-Are you sure?

10:28.540 --> 10:30.246
That's usually
your night out.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.376
That why you picked it?

10:31.380 --> 10:32.870
[laughs] No, dear.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.825
Yeah, I can make it work.

10:34.830 --> 10:37.879
You must have a very
understanding girlfriend.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.108
[chuckling]

10:39.120 --> 10:41.281
All the women
in my life are gems,
right, Syl?

10:41.290 --> 10:42.917
If you say so.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.787
Oh, uh,
Ben came by to see me.

10:45.790 --> 10:46.950
-Did he?
-Mm-hmm.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.530
About what?

10:48.540 --> 10:50.872
Well, he was asking questions
about the Pownall history.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.450
What kind of questions?

10:52.460 --> 10:55.111
He wanted to know
about the, uh...
the family lore.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.873
It was strange
the way he asked, though.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.279
-What do you mean?
-Uh, his tone.

10:59.290 --> 11:01.997
It was accusing, like he
thought I was hiding something.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.878
Well, what would make him
ask about that now?

11:04.880 --> 11:07.917
You got me.
Helen Hawkins maybe.

11:07.920 --> 11:11.071
Oh! That woman
loves to stir the pot.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.320
Yes, she does.

11:12.330 --> 11:13.820
You know,
he should know better

11:13.830 --> 11:15.491
than to listen to anything
she has to say.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.206
I'm worried about him, Ted.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.280
He never comes by,
he never calls.

11:19.290 --> 11:20.951
He's just finding himself.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.916
They all go through it.
He'll come back.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.956
In the meantime, I hope
you didn't tell him.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.245
Tell him what?

11:26.250 --> 11:29.208
Your family
was batshit crazy.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.370
[chuckles]

11:30.380 --> 11:31.824
Of course I did.

11:31.830 --> 11:33.457
Take a look around, honey.
It's no secret.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.786
[camera beeps]

11:46.040 --> 11:47.610
[chimes]

11:52.500 --> 11:54.456
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hey.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.069
[sharp breath]

12:02.830 --> 12:04.616
[Ben] So your sister,

12:04.620 --> 12:07.248
can she change on land
the way you do?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.616
Ryn, your sister,

12:11.620 --> 12:15.499
can she change on land
the way you do?

12:15.500 --> 12:16.910
Yes.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.571
Sister change.

12:21.420 --> 12:22.990
But hard.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.780
Pain.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.828
Wait, is that why
you tried to hurt me? Ryn?

12:32.830 --> 12:34.536
Ryn?

12:35.960 --> 12:38.531
Is that why you tried
to hurt me?

12:38.540 --> 12:40.997
In the water?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.661
Because you were in pain?

12:42.670 --> 12:44.615
No.

12:44.620 --> 12:48.909
In water, we fight.

12:53.750 --> 12:54.956
I kill.

12:56.460 --> 12:58.030
Or you kill.

13:00.620 --> 13:01.666
All right.

13:05.040 --> 13:05.950
Thank you.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.991
What do you got?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.070
I wanted you
to see this, sir.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.030
This is Group 1A.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.496
They were
the fully paralyzed rats.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.037
They received
pure DNA from the creature.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.702
[squeaking]

13:23.710 --> 13:26.031
How can this be?

13:26.040 --> 13:27.325
It's extraordinary.

13:30.420 --> 13:31.910
My God.

13:44.710 --> 13:46.575
All right.
Hey, Ryn.

13:48.710 --> 13:51.747
Can you tell me how many
of your species there are?

13:53.120 --> 13:55.577
How many like you?

13:55.580 --> 13:58.572
Is it just you
and your sister?

13:58.580 --> 14:00.787
-Or...
-No.

14:00.790 --> 14:02.576
Many.

14:04.330 --> 14:05.240
Many.

14:09.620 --> 14:10.951
[Ben]
And the others.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.702
the ones like you,
like your sister,

14:13.710 --> 14:17.168
do they want
to come here on land?

14:17.170 --> 14:20.162
Land bad.

14:20.170 --> 14:22.377
I learn this.

14:22.380 --> 14:24.075
-[phone vibrates]
-[hisses]

14:24.080 --> 14:25.786
Hey, hey, it's okay.

14:25.790 --> 14:28.281
It's just...
It's just a phone.

14:28.290 --> 14:29.609
[sharp breath]

14:29.620 --> 14:32.282
Hey, Xander?
What did you find out?

14:32.290 --> 14:35.077
Not much, but we know
whose phone Chris
called from.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.162
It's a nurse,
lives in Bremerton.

14:37.170 --> 14:38.740
So you think they got him
at a hospital?

14:38.750 --> 14:40.991
No, I doubt it.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.706
The sheriff called around
when they first took him,
came up empty,

14:42.710 --> 14:44.280
but we're headed
to her place now.
Can you meet us?

14:47.040 --> 14:49.417
Actually,
I-- I can't right now.

14:49.420 --> 14:50.409
Why not?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.536
[knife rings]

14:53.540 --> 14:55.610
I'm kinda
onto something here, too.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.702
Wait. Give it here.

14:57.710 --> 14:59.575
-Oh, yeah? What?
-Put it down.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.491
Uh, I'm trying
to figure out

15:03.500 --> 15:07.163
what it is
you guys caught on the boat.

15:07.170 --> 15:09.877
Hoping maybe it'll lead us
to the guys who took it.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.495
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.492
Let me know
if you guys find Chris.

15:14.500 --> 15:17.378
and, uh, I'll meet you ASAP.

15:17.380 --> 15:18.699
-All right, cool. Later.
-[phone beeps]

15:23.210 --> 15:25.110
You were right
as rain, boss.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.530
Yeah? About what?

15:26.540 --> 15:29.282
That was the victim's blood
on the clothing you found.

15:29.290 --> 15:31.997
I'm thinking
an animal came across it,

15:32.000 --> 15:33.490
dragged it from the scene,

15:33.500 --> 15:35.741
and that's why we found
non-human blood.

15:37.290 --> 15:39.497
Week ago,
my biggest problems

15:39.500 --> 15:42.822
were a bar brawl
and a meth lab.

15:42.830 --> 15:47.278
Now I've got a murder
and a missing fisherman
on my hands.

15:47.290 --> 15:49.372
You check in
on Chris Mueller's
family like I asked?

15:49.380 --> 15:51.371
They still haven't
heard from him.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.529
His mom's pretty freaked.

15:52.540 --> 15:55.418
Can't say that I blame her.

15:55.420 --> 15:56.819
I'd feel the same
if my kid disappeared

15:56.830 --> 15:58.491
in the middle
of the Bering Strait.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.069
So what do you got?

16:08.330 --> 16:09.820
That's her.

16:09.830 --> 16:12.162
Okay.

16:16.620 --> 16:18.531
Primate intelligence test.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.110
You're kidding,
right?

16:20.120 --> 16:23.248
No. There are 25 images
on this chart I gave her.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.286
Now, when I get
this screen to work,

16:25.290 --> 16:27.531
she'll see
the same 25 images,

16:27.540 --> 16:29.496
only they'll be scrambled.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.615
All right.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.287
She puts them
in the same order
as the chart.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.110
Is the screen working?

16:42.500 --> 16:44.877
Uh, yeah.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.326
[beeping]

16:55.580 --> 16:56.820
[screen beeps]

16:58.210 --> 17:00.110
She did it.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.451
Yes, she did.

17:10.830 --> 17:14.322
How long we gonna sit here
till she comes out?

17:14.330 --> 17:16.821
What makes you so sure
she's even here?

17:16.830 --> 17:18.536
That's her car.

17:18.540 --> 17:20.201
It's registered at the DMV.
I saw it online.

17:20.210 --> 17:21.609
Okay, so let's just
go knock on the door then.

17:21.620 --> 17:23.781
And say what?
The military took our friend

17:23.790 --> 17:24.916
when they captured
the mermaid

17:24.920 --> 17:26.490
and he texted us
from your phone?

17:26.500 --> 17:28.115
Well, we gotta do something.

17:28.120 --> 17:29.701
She knows where Chris is.

17:29.710 --> 17:31.780
He could be dying right now
as we sit here on our asses.

17:31.790 --> 17:33.530
Use your head
for, like, a minute.

17:33.540 --> 17:35.610
Please. She's not gonna
tell us anything,

17:35.620 --> 17:37.281
and if we scare her,
she's not gonna go
anywhere near him,

17:37.290 --> 17:38.370
so just chill.

17:38.380 --> 17:40.746
I don't know.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.320
She's gonna lead us
to Chris.

17:44.380 --> 17:45.870
I know she is.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.700
[sighs]

17:47.710 --> 17:49.325
[Ben]
Let's walk over there.

17:49.330 --> 17:50.991
Yeah, up on here.

17:53.330 --> 17:55.992
Good.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.662
Wow. 1-9-6.

18:00.750 --> 18:01.739
[Ben] Hold on.

18:01.750 --> 18:03.160
One second.

18:05.380 --> 18:07.325
Yeah.

18:07.330 --> 18:08.615
1-9-6.

18:10.170 --> 18:13.378
Wow. We're gonna have to do
a bone density study.

18:17.380 --> 18:18.608
[Ben] You like that?

18:18.620 --> 18:20.872
I'll show you
how it works.

18:22.330 --> 18:23.410
[hisses]

18:24.460 --> 18:26.075
It's okay.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.411
All right.

18:27.420 --> 18:32.369
Press there.

18:32.380 --> 18:35.452
[heart beating rapidly]

18:35.460 --> 18:37.781
[song playing]

18:40.790 --> 18:42.451
Oh-oh-oh-oh

18:42.460 --> 18:44.951
You wake
the wild howling rebel in me

18:44.960 --> 18:46.279
Oh-oh-oh-oh

18:46.290 --> 18:48.417
You rev me up

18:48.420 --> 18:50.991
-[Ben] Okay, okay, okay.
- Ain't slowin' down

18:51.000 --> 18:53.878
-Never again.
- Yeah, I always
find the beat

18:53.880 --> 18:55.825
-Reflex test?
- No, don't quit now

18:55.830 --> 18:57.991
And let me down

18:58.000 --> 19:00.662
Oh, you keep me singin'
all by yourself

19:00.670 --> 19:03.036
-All right.
- We got such
a beautiful thing

19:03.040 --> 19:04.667
Just relax your foot.

19:04.670 --> 19:06.206
We got such
a beautiful thing

19:06.210 --> 19:07.700
We got
such a beautiful thing

19:12.000 --> 19:14.241
Wow.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.411
Reflexes working.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.376
Oh-oh-oh-oh

19:23.880 --> 19:25.666
Who's that?

19:25.670 --> 19:26.659
It's Janine.

19:26.670 --> 19:28.206
I'll call her back.

19:31.460 --> 19:32.916
[Alvin sighs]

19:32.920 --> 19:34.911
You can't be
such a dick to her, man.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.820
-What?
-I'm just saying...

19:36.830 --> 19:40.038
That's just Janine and me.
It's always been that way.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.280
Yeah, well,
I don't want my best friend

19:41.290 --> 19:42.826
and my girl
to be hating on each other.

19:42.830 --> 19:44.707
Janine's your girl?

19:44.710 --> 19:46.746
-We're hangin' out.
-Sorry, man.

19:46.750 --> 19:47.956
Thought you guys
were just screwin'.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.871
Yeah, we were, but...

19:49.880 --> 19:50.915
now we're not.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.109
Okay.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.666
-[Xander] That's her.
-[Alvin] You sure?

19:57.670 --> 19:59.410
Yeah. I saw a picture
on Facebook.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.706
[engine starts]

[Siren song echoing]

[gaSPSI

21:28.880 --> 21:30.529
Hey, Dad.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.612
Hey. Got the invoice reports
from last week?

21:33.620 --> 21:34.951
Right here.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.575
Up from the week before.

21:36.580 --> 21:37.990
Griffin's really
comin' through for us.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.877
-That's a great deal
you set up.
-Thanks.

21:39.880 --> 21:44.533
Hey, I was wondering
about that letter
you drafted to the board.

21:44.540 --> 21:46.451
I meant to talk to you
about that.

21:46.460 --> 21:47.779
I think it's
a great idea

21:47.790 --> 21:49.166
bringing Ben in
as a consultant.

21:49.170 --> 21:52.537
Environmental advisor--
sends a great message.

21:52.540 --> 21:54.610
That's what I thought,
PR-wise.

21:54.620 --> 21:57.874
I mean, you know,
he's never gonna play
the role you play.

21:57.880 --> 21:58.915
Obviously.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.239
Right.

22:00.250 --> 22:03.572
But, uh, it'll make
your mother happy.

22:05.580 --> 22:07.662
[Doug] Makes sense.

22:07.670 --> 22:08.876
Invoice reports.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.245
You think he'll do it?

22:10.250 --> 22:11.706
Depends on our approach.

22:11.710 --> 22:13.610
We both know your brother.

22:18.710 --> 22:20.871
[Maddie] How long
can you stay here?

22:20.880 --> 22:22.165
On land?

22:22.170 --> 22:24.661
Last time,
she only lasted a day.

22:24.670 --> 22:25.659
Ryn?

22:27.880 --> 22:30.610
You might need to get back
in the water soon.

22:30.620 --> 22:31.530
No.

22:31.540 --> 22:34.202
Find sister.

22:34.210 --> 22:35.609
You might have to.

22:35.620 --> 22:38.953
No! You say help me.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.416
You say this.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.456
[hisses]

22:51.000 --> 22:52.956
How long's
she been like this?

22:52.960 --> 22:55.827
Several hours.

22:55.830 --> 22:57.206

Hang in there.

The worst is over.

23:11.750 --> 23:13.115
You find sister.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.610
You say this!

23:14.620 --> 23:15.666
Ryn, we're trying.

23:15.670 --> 23:18.787
We've got people looking.

23:18.790 --> 23:21.076
Oh, hey.
How's it goin'?

23:21.080 --> 23:22.160
Hey, Jerry.

doing here?

23:24.580 --> 23:26.241
That's cool. I can do it.

23:26.250 --> 23:28.070
I'm here now.
I might as well.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.286
Hey. I'm Jerry.

23:31.290 --> 23:33.076
I am Ryn.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.287
Ryn's a friend
of mine from school.

23:35.290 --> 23:37.667
Oh, cool.
What's with the camera?

23:37.670 --> 23:38.489
You guys shootin'
a porno?

23:38.500 --> 23:41.207

So, Ryn,
you an exchange student?

25:57.670 --> 25:59.820
That can't be easy.

25:59.830 --> 26:03.914
You know, I hear that English
is one of the toughest
languages to learn.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.377
Yes. I learn.

26:06.380 --> 26:08.166

we're looking for her.

26:17.120 --> 26:18.417
Let me know if you see her.

26:18.420 --> 26:20.957
She hasn't shown up
at Helen's.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.780
Did Jerry text you back?

26:22.790 --> 26:23.950
_ He was outside.
He might have seen her leave.

26:23.960 --> 26:25.325
No, not yet.

26:25.330 --> 26:26.706
Think she went
back in the water?

26:26.710 --> 26:28.450
Not the way she was
talking earlier.

26:28.460 --> 26:29.916
Come on. Let's go.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.615
Let's look in town.

26:35.710 --> 26:37.666
We've been following her
for a while.

26:37.670 --> 26:38.819
It's a dead end, man.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.786
She's heading toward 84.

26:40.790 --> 26:42.371
That'll take her
out of town, and maybe
she's going to work.

26:42.380 --> 26:43.916
Just run her off the road.
We'll corner her.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.205
Oh, yeah,

It's Jerry.
He's having a party.

what are you doing here?

28:16.250 --> 28:18.036
Thought you might be here.

Cool.

Hey, Maddie.

28:20.960 --> 28:21.870
Hey, Doug.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.370
Do you want to grab a beer?

28:23.380 --> 28:24.950
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.496
I'd love to.
Really, I would.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.377
I just-- I'm looking
for someone right now.

28:28.380 --> 28:29.824
Can we do this a little later?

28:32.500 --> 28:34.161
Maybe you better
talk to him.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.569
I'll find her.

28:37.420 --> 28:39.376
All right. Go.

Her DNA is showing
enormous potential.

28:48.420 --> 28:51.912
We are _
accelerating the testing
based on what we're seeing.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.490
I'm afraid we'll
have to reconSIder

28:53.500 --> 28:55.411
the rate at which
we're movmg, Admiral.

28:55.420 --> 28:57.069
And why would we do that?

28:57.080 --> 28:58.536
You can see by our numbers

28:58.540 --> 29:00.610
that the extractions are
affecting her adversely.

29:00.620 --> 29:03.828
Well, my concern
at the moment is
results, Decker.

29:03.830 --> 29:06.492
Respectfully, we have
to slow the program down, sir.

29:06.500 --> 29:08.036
She's in distress.

29:08.040 --> 29:11.112
Well, I'm sorry
about that. I am.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.247
But we're making
progress here.

29:13.250 --> 29:14.660
You need to do
whatever it takes

29:14.670 --> 29:16.410
to get this program
on track

29:16.420 --> 29:17.956
and keep her alive.

29:29.620 --> 29:32.077
[rock music playing]

So what's up?

29:37.290 --> 29:39.702
I just wanted
to grab a beer,

29:39.710 --> 29:40.870
just hang out.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.576
Talk about this plan
Dad's got.

29:43.580 --> 29:45.241
What plan?

29:45.250 --> 29:46.990
He wanted to see
if you'd do some work with us.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.377
We've been through this
a million times.

29:49.380 --> 29:52.452
No, we haven't
been through this.

29:52.460 --> 29:54.200
You've been
through it with him.

29:54.210 --> 29:56.997
Okay, sure.

it's you over here,

30:07.420 --> 30:11.072
and I'm with Mom and Dad
somewhere else.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.991
I don't get it.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.490
What did I do
to make that happen?

30:14.500 --> 30:16.070
Nothing, Doug.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.741
You didn't do anything.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.616
There she is.

Were you trying to reach me?

37:50.170 --> 37:52.115
Who is this?

37:52.120 --> 37:53.781
[beeps]

37:55.210 --> 37:56.495
What the hell are you--

37:56.500 --> 37:57.615
Why'd you do that, man?

37:57.620 --> 37:59.497
[heart monitor beeping]

38:05.250 --> 38:06.786
[Xander]
What was I supposed to do?

38:06.790 --> 38:08.667
Ask her about Chris?
She's in there with him.

38:08.670 --> 38:09.955
We need to get her alone.

38:09.960 --> 38:12.576
She was alone
this morning in the house.

38:12.580 --> 38:14.616
You said
she wouldn't talk.

38:16.170 --> 38:17.660
[scoffs]

38:20.880 --> 38:22.416
Look, I don't know
what to do.

38:24.210 --> 38:25.370
Okay?

38:27.120 --> 38:29.497
What are we gonna do?

38:29.500 --> 38:30.785
Nothing.

38:30.790 --> 38:33.497
We're gonna wait right here,

38:33.500 --> 38:34.876
and we're gonna
make her talk.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.457
[phone ringing
and vibrating]

38:52.580 --> 38:53.535
Admiral.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.110
What can I do for you?

38:55.120 --> 38:57.111
[Harrison] NSA just sent
facial recognition

38:57.120 --> 38:59.497
from your lure's video feed.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.912
We know who found it.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.205
I'm sending it to you now.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.610
[phone chimes]

39:05.620 --> 39:10.489
[Harrison]
Benjamin Gregory Pownall,
26 years old,

39:10.500 --> 39:13.822
a marine biologist
at the Bristol Cove
Mammal Research Center.

39:21.540 --> 39:22.666
It's late.

39:24.620 --> 39:26.281
Helen will be asleep.

39:26.290 --> 39:27.996
You'll stay here tonight.

39:44.460 --> 39:45.495
[Ben] Good night.

40:21.330 --> 40:23.992
[dramatic music playing]

40:54.210 --> 40:55.916
I'm changing protocol.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.741
We're putting a hold
of all extractions.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.741
Are you sure, sir?

41:00.750 --> 41:02.570
The admiral seemed to
think accelerating the--

41:02.580 --> 41:04.320
I'll keep him updated.

41:04.330 --> 41:06.457
Testing is suspended
indefinitely.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.786
[placid high-pitched calls]

41:31.380 --> 41:34.998
[woman singing Siren song]
