Don't mourn
for Joe Strombel.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.797
Joe Strombel led a full life.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.165
A newspaperman
in the best tradition.

01:50.977 --> 01:52.945
A great credit
to the fourth estate.

01:54.147 --> 01:57.082
It didn't matter
if the bombs in the
war zone were falling.

01:57.484 --> 02:00.647
It didn't matter
how high up
the political scandal went,

02:01.387 --> 02:03.617
or how many
big corporations

02:03.723 --> 02:06.214
or small-time racketeers
leaned on him.

02:07.393 --> 02:10.384
Whatever the risk,
if there was a story there,

02:10.864 --> 02:14.129
Joe went after it.
And he usually got it.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.428
Well, I was with him
when the story broke
about Prince Charles,

02:17.504 --> 02:20.302
and that made him
persona non grata
with the Royal Family.

02:20.373 --> 02:23.240
Except with Diana.
They always remained
good friends.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.936
(ALL AGREEING)
He did love a woman.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.510
Hey, did you know he started
as a police reporter?

02:27.580 --> 02:29.343
Did he?
Yeah, he was
a bloody good one.

02:29.415 --> 02:31.349
One of the best.
Maybe the best.

02:31.417 --> 02:33.851
I got trapped with Joe once
in Afghanistan.

02:33.920 --> 02:34.909
Yeah?

02:35.088 --> 02:37.181
And we were going
to be shot any moment
by the Taliban, until,

02:38.024 --> 02:39.685
typically, Joe found
someone to bribe

02:39.826 --> 02:41.453
(ALL LAUGHING)
So we could escape.

02:41.528 --> 02:44.588
MAN 1: Not with his own money,
though.
No, no, he got it on expenses.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.029
MAN 2: Plus 10%.
MAN 3: Ten percent.

02:46.299 --> 02:49.268
But it did
involve us getting out
wearing burkas.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.198
And, well, we lived
to write another day.

02:52.272 --> 02:54.001
Everyone loved him.
Yeah.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.768
MAN 1: Not always at
British intelligence.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.037
No, but he got
the information
before anyone else.

02:58.144 --> 03:00.169
Yeah, he did. That's right.
Not Richard Nixon, though.

03:01.047 --> 03:04.483
Well, wherever you are now,
Joe, it won't be the same
without you, mate.

03:05.385 --> 03:06.852

03:57.237 --> 03:59.569
So, what do you do?
Reporter.

03:59.639 --> 04:01.163
Hmm.
You?

04:01.741 --> 04:06.337
I'm... Well, I was
personal secretary
to Peter Lyman.

04:06.779 --> 04:09.509
Lord Lyman's son.
Yes, impressive young man.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.781
You knew him?
No, only by reputation.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.550
But I like what I know.

04:14.387 --> 04:16.582
I think he's got
a real future in politics.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.350
How did you die?

04:20.560 --> 04:21.993
I think I was poisoned.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.085
You think?

04:24.931 --> 04:25.989
Why?

04:26.599 --> 04:27.930
I believe I was poisoned

04:28.001 --> 04:30.834
because I was
on the verge of confirming
a terrible suspicion.

04:32.071 --> 04:33.868
Yes?
What suspicion is that?

04:35.508 --> 04:37.772
That Peter Lyman
is the serial killer

04:38.044 --> 04:40.672
known to the police
as the Tarot Card Killer.

04:41.781 --> 04:42.907
(CHUCKLES) What?

04:43.516 --> 04:45.177
I assume
you're aware of that case?

04:45.351 --> 04:48.718
Yeah, I wrote an article
two years ago, when the
Tarot killings first started.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.256
But Peter Lyman? My God.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.219
What on earth
made you suspect

04:53.293 --> 04:55.784
this rich, young handsome,
above-reproach citizen?

04:56.429 --> 04:59.091
You remember the last murder?
The police found a clue.

04:59.432 --> 05:02.492
Yes, a cufflink.
I read about it in the paper.
Unusual antique, wasn't it?

05:02.769 --> 05:05.203
Yep.
Very rare Art Deco.

05:05.772 --> 05:07.967
Peter had the exact pair.

05:09.175 --> 05:10.904
So could have
the Tarot Killer.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.569
The world is full
of coincidences.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.910
Yeah, except I noticed
that Peter only had one left.

05:16.416 --> 05:17.883
He'd lost the other.

05:19.285 --> 05:20.513
Still,

05:20.887 --> 05:22.616
although
it's a tantalizing thought.

05:22.689 --> 05:25.123
Did you inform the police,
or was that too sticky?

05:25.291 --> 05:27.418
I didn't know what to do,
so I phoned my lawyer

05:27.493 --> 05:29.723
and I asked his advice
on whether to
report it or not.

05:30.129 --> 05:33.394
And I thought
I heard this click
on the phone,

05:33.733 --> 05:35.598
you know, like someone
had been listening.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.798
Later that day, after tea,

05:38.871 --> 05:40.771
I died suddenly.

05:45.445 --> 05:47.208
That is suspicious.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.911
My God, Peter Lyman.

05:53.052 --> 05:55.452
Hard to believe,
but if he did turn out
to be the Tarot Killer,

05:56.255 --> 05:57.415
what a story.

05:57.490 --> 06:00.118
I knew you'd appreciate it
when you said
you were a reporter.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.094
This would be
a dynamite scoop.
And I got it first.

06:03.162 --> 06:06.222
Yeah. Unfortunately,
where you're headed
there is no first.

06:06.332 --> 06:07.993
There's only last.

06:18.845 --> 06:20.369
REPORTER 1: Mr. Tinsley!
Loved your last picture.

06:20.446 --> 06:21.777
You really have a way
with actors.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.213
Think you could maybe...
Please wait!

06:24.984 --> 06:26.747

Yeah.

06:27.487 --> 06:29.955

06:30.690 --> 06:33.625
Sondra Pransky.
I'm the journalism
student from Adair.

06:33.693 --> 06:36.389
I wrote to you
about getting an interview
for the school newspaper.

06:36.462 --> 06:37.451
Oh...

06:37.563 --> 06:41.021
And you, well,
your secretary, actually,
because... Not you.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.500
I mean, I know how busy
film directors get and all.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.299
But you said
if I was in London visiting,
then you would, you know,

06:46.672 --> 06:48.697
and here I am,
which is fantastic.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.569
I think I have
your letter, actually.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.905
See, right now
I'm a bit tied up.
Here it is!

06:53.546 --> 06:55.480
Here it is.
This is so great for me.

06:55.548 --> 06:58.381
I mean, you've got
a huge following in Rochester.

06:58.451 --> 06:59.679
It gets very cold there.

06:59.786 --> 07:02.584
With your new movie
coming out in the fall,
and... Well...

07:02.822 --> 07:04.221
Actually,

07:04.991 --> 07:08.256
I was wondering
if we could just ask you
a couple of questions.

07:08.327 --> 07:11.694
Do you mind?
Okay, okay, but
we got to be real quick.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.713
SONDRA: I write
for the cultural part
of the paper.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.617
I'm looking to move into
more serious pieces.

07:34.987 --> 07:39.014
And when you say something
more serious, that's...

07:41.928 --> 07:43.361
You really want to know?

07:44.197 --> 07:46.631
Well, originally, I wasn't
going to go to college.

07:46.699 --> 07:49.725
I was going to become
a dental hygienist
like my sister, Beverly.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.895
And, don't get me wrong,
it's a great profession.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.429
I have very high respect
for teeth and gums,
particularly gums.

07:55.508 --> 07:56.941
My whole family's
in orthodontics. But...

07:57.009 --> 08:00.342
And what?
You're vacationing here?
Oh, yes.

08:00.546 --> 08:05.006
Oh, I'm just very friendly
with a very upper class
British family.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.143
Our families vacationed
in Palm Beach together.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.619
My mother
won a visit to Palm Beach

08:08.688 --> 08:11.213
and I became friends
with their granddaughter,
Vivian.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.951
She's so lovely.
She'll stay with us...

08:13.125 --> 08:15.593
Another?
Oh, thanks.

08:16.762 --> 08:20.163
So I slept with him
and I didn't even
get the interview.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.757
I mean,
what kind of a reporter am I?

08:21.901 --> 08:23.869
How was the sex?
Give me all the details.

08:23.936 --> 08:26.530
Who knows? I was so drunk,
I don't even remember.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.136
All I know is that
the second it was over,

08:28.207 --> 08:30.402
he got a phone call
and had to leave
suddenly for Thailand.

08:30.476 --> 08:31.465
Thailand?

08:31.544 --> 08:35.344
Yeah, Justin Richards
got fired from some project
and he had to take over.

08:35.414 --> 08:36.438
What difference does it make?

08:36.515 --> 08:38.177
The point is,
I told the whole school

08:38.251 --> 08:40.412
I'd get an exclusive
with Michael Tinsley!

08:40.486 --> 08:41.475

you're a very attractive,

movers and shakers
in their hotel rooms,

08:50.363 --> 08:51.523
you better watch out.

08:51.597 --> 08:54.623
Not that I'd mind
a roll in the hay
with Michael Tinsley.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.834
I've put some fresh towels
in your bedroom, Sondra.

SONDRA: The point is
I didn't get the story!

09:05.077 --> 09:06.806
I mean, if I'd used
my feminine wiles

09:06.879 --> 09:08.574
like Katharine Hepburn
or Rosalind Russell.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.013

God bless you, sweetheart.

13:07.386 --> 13:09.251
You got
a fantastic sense of humor.

13:09.321 --> 13:11.516
You know if more people
in the world
had a sense of humor,

13:11.590 --> 13:13.854
we would not be
in the state we are in today.

We take off
the same holidays.
Doesn't matter.

You're a journalist, right?
Oh, my God.
What are you doing in here?

13:41.787 --> 13:43.186
Aren't you
a journalist? Yeah?

13:43.322 --> 13:45.688
I mean,
those are the vibrations
I've been concentrating on.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.588
Are you ready, Sondra?

13:47.693 --> 13:50.821
I'm Joe Strombel,
reporter, and I have
the scoop of the decade

13:50.896 --> 13:52.488
about the Tarot Card

13:52.565 --> 13:54.294
I mean if it pans out,
it'll be fantastic.

13:54.366 --> 13:57.665
It's got everything.
Big names,
murder, prostitution.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.302
I'm going to start agitating
your molecules.

14:00.372 --> 14:02.772
You're a journalist.
I've got some
information for you.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.336
Big story.
Big, big, big scoop.

She's never been on stage
before. So, you know...

14:36.308 --> 14:37.400
She's a little stunned.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.943
Are your molecules okay?
Is everything feeling good?

14:40.012 --> 14:41.809
You all in shape?
You got all your parts?

Hey, Mandelbaum!
From the school newspaper,
am I right?

15:23.722 --> 15:24.746
No, Pransky.

15:24.823 --> 15:26.791
Listen, I have to talk to you
about something very serious.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.292
When you put me
inside that box...

15:28.427 --> 15:30.657
(EXCLAIMS) I smell
a frivolous lawsuit here.

15:30.796 --> 15:33.822
You going to tell me
you're getting headaches now
or something? Dizzy spells?

15:33.999 --> 15:36.797
No. No. When you put me inside
that Chinese box...

15:36.869 --> 15:38.359
Yeah, the dematerializer.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.961
...a spirit materialized.

15:40.506 --> 15:41.495
Uh-huh...

15:41.640 --> 15:43.835
No, Mr. Splendini,
I'm very serious about this.

15:43.909 --> 15:46.104
You can drop the Splendini.
My name is Sidney Waterman.

15:46.178 --> 15:47.805
You know what I mean?
I just go exotic

15:47.880 --> 15:51.008
to give the square haircuts
a little charisma
now and then.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.347
Look, the spirit appeared
right next to me!

15:53.419 --> 15:55.080
At first I thought
he was one of your stooges.

15:55.154 --> 15:58.317
I don't work with stooges,
you know, because you gotta
pay them health benefits.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.381
But then he told me
his name was Joe Strombel,

16:00.492 --> 16:02.460
a journalist
from the land of the departed.

16:02.528 --> 16:03.552
I couldn't believe it.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.256
I'm a journalist,
he's a journalist.

16:05.397 --> 16:08.594
I mean, our vibes
must have kind of
meshed together and...

16:08.701 --> 16:10.100
You know,
he didn't say that,
in so many words,

16:10.169 --> 16:11.636
but I'm putting
two and two together here.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.696
Do me a favor,
put two and two together
someplace else,

16:14.807 --> 16:17.605
because I'm very, very busy.
So, do you mind?

16:17.676 --> 16:20.577
Listen, I Googled him, okay?
There is a Joe Strombel

16:20.713 --> 16:22.806
and he died three days ago.
Uh-huh.

back in the box.

I'm a journalist at Adair.
I know you may have been
aiming a little bit higher,

16:51.944 --> 16:56.779
(CHUCKLES) but I assure you,
whatever I lack in experience,
I make up for in dedication.

16:57.149 --> 17:00.312
I'm beginning
to lose patience, Sondra.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.287
So, let's go.
Is there anybody
in there at all?

Come on, sweetheart.
And if I were you,

17:11.163 --> 17:13.290
I would not tell this episode
to anyone else,

17:13.365 --> 17:15.060
because they'll take away
your driver's license.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.327
I don't understand.
What? What's to understand?

17:17.403 --> 17:19.200
I thought that...
It's plywood.
I built it.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.636
(STUTTERING)
What're you thinking,
there are spirits?

17:20.705 --> 17:22.970
And there's
a world of departed people?

17:23.041 --> 17:24.599
I don't know
what you've been smoking,

17:24.675 --> 17:26.644
but don't try
and bring it through customs.

17:26.744 --> 17:28.372
Darling,
I'm a little late.

17:28.446 --> 17:30.438
Sweetheart, I love you.
You know that.

17:30.582 --> 17:31.947
I say this
with all due respect, but...
I...

17:32.017 --> 17:33.006
Sondra? Sondra?

17:33.886 --> 17:35.683
Mr. Strombel.
Listen to me, Sondra.

17:36.088 --> 17:39.421
Carefully. Listen to me, hmm?
Write this down.
This is a big story.

17:40.859 --> 17:41.848
You got a pen?

17:42.394 --> 17:44.862
STROMBEL: I only
have a minute.
Would you hurry?

17:46.331 --> 17:47.320
Fine.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.993
There's every reason
to believe that Peter Lyman...
You got that name?

17:50.102 --> 17:52.400
Yes.
Peter Lyman.
Son of Lord Lyman,

17:52.504 --> 17:54.563
a respected businessman, hmm?

17:54.640 --> 17:56.870
Rich, good-looking,
very successful.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.067
That Peter Lyman is
the Tarot Card Serial Killer.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.477
Now, just
write this down.

18:02.614 --> 18:06.880
If so, that he's murdered
a dozen women. Short-haired,
brunette prostitutes.

18:07.152 --> 18:08.414
And if
it turns out to be Lyman,

18:08.487 --> 18:10.648
this will be the biggest story
to hit London
since Jack the Ripper.

18:10.722 --> 18:13.054
"Jack the Ripper."
Is that capitalized?

18:13.125 --> 18:15.525
There's no knowing
where he'll strike next,

18:15.594 --> 18:18.222
but more women
will be murdered
until he is stopped.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.857
That's horrible!
We have to notify the police.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.398
No, no.
What kind of reporter are you?

18:22.468 --> 18:24.436
That would be a disaster!
God, no!

18:24.570 --> 18:27.471
He's a respected millionaire.
You can't accuse anyone,

18:27.539 --> 18:29.939
let alone someone like that
without substantial proof.

18:30.008 --> 18:34.240
And once you've alerted him
to the suspicion...
That he is under suspicion,

18:34.313 --> 18:35.871
then he'll be
impossible to trap.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.745
(CHUCKLES) Not to mention
doubly dangerous.

18:37.816 --> 18:40.717
There's also a possibility
that he poisoned his secretary

18:40.786 --> 18:43.721
because he suspected that
she was learning the truth.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.189
No, you have to
get the story first,

18:46.258 --> 18:48.692
but first you have to
get the story right!

18:48.927 --> 18:51.657
There's no certainty
in this, or...

18:51.864 --> 18:53.661
I got a feeling
in my gut about this.

18:53.732 --> 18:55.757
The kind
that journalists dream about.

18:56.435 --> 18:58.665
And so far, no one else
has the information.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.704
(CHUCKLES) Oh,
if I was around today,

19:01.874 --> 19:03.865
I'd find a way
to get the facts

19:03.942 --> 19:05.239
and break this case
wide open!

19:05.310 --> 19:06.743
Now, believe me, Sondra.

19:08.580 --> 19:11.378
You can wait your whole life
for a story like this.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.917
Don't blow it.

19:13.385 --> 19:16.081
And be careful.
Lives are in the balance.

19:16.755 --> 19:18.052
Possibly, maybe yours.

19:19.024 --> 19:21.720
Got to go. Got to go.

19:33.272 --> 19:35.172
That's it for me.
You got to help me with this.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.140
Not me, honey.
I'm a prestidigitator.

19:37.209 --> 19:38.801
I do coin tricks
and card tricks.

19:38.877 --> 19:40.469
And I'm a journalist
sitting on top of

19:40.546 --> 19:42.138
one of the biggest
stories of all time!

19:42.214 --> 19:43.875
Yeah. For a college paper!

19:43.949 --> 19:45.177
Kid, you're in
over your head.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.151
You know what you should do?
You should share this story.
Share it?

19:48.220 --> 19:50.051
No!
I gotta dig up the facts

19:50.389 --> 19:52.789
and then
I gotta shop it around
to every paper in town.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.485
(MUTTERING)
Look at her.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.084
Soon you'll be drinking
the black coffee

19:56.161 --> 19:58.026
and smoking cigarettes
with the hat back.
Now, what kind of...

19:58.096 --> 19:59.563
We don't have much time here.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.361
I mean, we got to strike!
You know this guy's
a serial killer.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.800
He could just kill
at any moment!

20:04.870 --> 20:07.771
I heard that part.
That's when I knew
I was gonna make other plans.

20:07.839 --> 20:09.898
You should go call the police.
That's what I'd do.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.374
Yeah, and
what am I gonna tell them?

20:11.443 --> 20:13.343
Tell them that...
Exactly what he told you.

20:13.412 --> 20:17.712
That Lord Lyman's son,
Peter, is... He suspects
he's a serial killer.

20:17.849 --> 20:20.784
Uh-huh, and when they ask me
where I got this
information from?

20:20.852 --> 20:23.719
(STUTTERING) Well, tell them!
You know, just say,
you know tell them...

20:24.389 --> 20:25.754
Just explain to them that...

20:26.058 --> 20:27.821
You know, say that...
Tell them...

20:28.860 --> 20:30.350
Where did you get
the information?

20:30.429 --> 20:32.329
Was that the question
that you just asked?

20:33.799 --> 20:36.393
I would not say anything
if I were you 'cause
they'll put you away.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.436
(STUTTERING) That's exactly
what I'm saying.

20:38.503 --> 20:41.199
I'm gonna say,
"I got this information
from a dead guy"?

20:41.273 --> 20:44.504
Listen, this is not for me,
Sondra. I don't do this.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.568
I do occasional bar mitzvahs
and kids' parties.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.404
You know, you're
barking up the wrong tree.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.814
Peter Lyman.
Who is Peter Lyman, you know?

20:52.884 --> 20:55.045
How can we meet him?

20:55.120 --> 20:57.384
How can we see
what we're dealing with here?

21:04.029 --> 21:05.018
(SCOFFING)

21:05.697 --> 21:08.791
What the hell are we doing
here? You don't even know
what the guy looks like.

21:08.867 --> 21:09.856
That's why we're here.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.233
I just couldn't get
a clear picture of him
on the Internet, so...

21:12.304 --> 21:16.206
(STUTTERING) Jesus.
And what are we going to do
if we see him?

21:16.308 --> 21:18.333
I mean, what
are you gonna learn
by looking at him?

21:18.410 --> 21:21.743
Unless he
strangles a passerby.

21:21.847 --> 21:24.042
I don't know, Sidney.
I'm improvising.

21:24.182 --> 21:26.776
I should be home,
working on my magic.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.452
Hey, why don't you
think about this

21:29.521 --> 21:31.182
as adding
some excitement to your life?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.982
Hey, sweetheart,
excitement in my life

21:34.059 --> 21:36.584
is dinner
without heartburn after it.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.892
Do you have a family?

21:42.868 --> 21:47.464
I had a wife,
but she dumped me,
if you can believe that.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.141
Somehow...

21:50.909 --> 21:53.537
She thought I was immature
and that I never grew up.

21:53.945 --> 21:56.277
Now, I had
a great rebuttal for her.

21:56.348 --> 21:57.508
I could have nailed her,
you know,

21:57.582 --> 22:01.746
but I raised my hand
and she would not call on me.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.214
Sidney...
What?

22:03.288 --> 22:04.380
That's him.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.888
Let's follow him.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.687
Follow? What do you
want to follow him for?

22:12.798 --> 22:16.097
I'm telling you.
We need clues, we need a lead.
We gotta start someplace.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.568
No, darling, I do not think
this is a good idea.

22:18.637 --> 22:19.899
It's a very good idea.

22:22.774 --> 22:23.763
Come on!

22:30.982 --> 22:31.971
Be careful.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.653
Hey, don't touch anything.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.211
You know,
if you break something here,

22:37.289 --> 22:39.814
you're gonna be washing dishes
the rest of your life.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.081
(EXCLAIMS)

22:45.630 --> 22:47.655
SID: Okay,
now you've seen him. Let's go.

22:47.766 --> 22:51.224
Jerry! It's Jerry Burke,
Louis' chiropractor.

22:51.303 --> 22:52.668
Hi.
Nice to see you.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.738
That's how you follow a guy?
It's not even Peter Lyman!

22:55.807 --> 22:57.934
I told you
the photos weren't clear.

22:58.009 --> 23:00.876
Sweetheart,
you should live
and be well, prosper.

23:00.946 --> 23:03.608
I hope... I say this
with all due respect.

23:03.682 --> 23:04.979
But without me.

23:05.050 --> 23:08.816
I'm tired, I'm bored,
I'm hungry, I'm going home.
God love you.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.014
I'll look for your byline.
Sidney!

23:13.024 --> 23:15.788
I'm about to become
your favorite person.
Why?

23:15.861 --> 23:17.852
I ran into someone today
who said that Peter Lyman

23:17.929 --> 23:19.897
swims at the Governor's Club
every day.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.794
Really?
What's the Governor's Club?

23:21.867 --> 23:23.129
It's this posh, private club,

23:23.201 --> 23:25.567
but Daddy's partner's a member
and members are allowed
to bring guests.

23:25.637 --> 23:27.730
Wow, do you think
I could bring someone?

23:27.806 --> 23:30.240
I'm sure
Daddy can arrange it.
When do you want to go?

23:38.950 --> 23:40.383
How can I help you?

23:40.452 --> 23:42.716
Hi.
We're guests of the Fultons.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.016
We're here to take a dip.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.387
Oh, yes, yes. The lockers
are on the first floor.

23:46.458 --> 23:47.891
The pool's downstairs.
Great.

23:48.193 --> 23:51.162
By the way,
is Peter Lyman here,
by any chance?

23:51.229 --> 23:52.355
Mr. Lyman.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.864
Yes, came in
a few minutes ago.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.729
What color bathing suit
does he have on?

23:55.801 --> 23:56.790
Hey.

23:56.868 --> 23:59.359
I... Do you want me
to clash with him?

24:01.373 --> 24:02.362
So silly.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.441
So do you swim?
Of course I don't swim.
You have to ask?

24:06.511 --> 24:08.638
What? They say
it's the best form
of exercise.

24:08.914 --> 24:10.506
Yes, but when
I go into the water,

24:10.582 --> 24:14.279
my glasses, you know,
float off my head
into the pool.

24:15.253 --> 24:17.244
Hey, Sidney,
that's got to be him.

24:17.322 --> 24:18.721
Yeah, well,
make sure this time.

24:18.790 --> 24:21.554
'Cause I don't want
to swim around after
another chiropractor.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.184
Hmm, he's very handsome.

24:23.829 --> 24:27.765
This guy is a serial killer
like I play for
the New York Jets.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.832
How can we meet him?

24:31.002 --> 24:33.197
(STUTTERING) I don't know.
They have a class system.

24:33.271 --> 24:35.899
He's an aristocrat,
and, you know,
we're commoners.

24:36.074 --> 24:39.908
In fact, according to his
system, I think we're probably
classified as scum.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.845
This is our only chance.
He's all alone.

24:43.381 --> 24:44.848
Well, you're
a pretty girl.

24:44.916 --> 24:48.408
You know, I think you could
probably get this guy
to get interested in you.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.183
Don't be silly.
Particularly if he's got
a twisted mind.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.887
Look, I can't
just go up to him and say,
"Hi, how are you?"

24:55.961 --> 24:58.987
I mean,
what if he gets suspicious,
or, you know,

24:59.064 --> 25:01.464
if he gets put off, or...

25:01.566 --> 25:02.555
Drown.

25:03.301 --> 25:05.895
What?
Drown! Drown!
I'll go get... I'll go get...

25:05.971 --> 25:07.268
(SCOFFS)
Listen to me!

25:07.339 --> 25:08.533
I'll go get coffee.

25:08.607 --> 25:11.542
Get a cramp,
go in the water,
flounder around,

25:11.610 --> 25:12.804
you know. Yes!

25:13.345 --> 25:16.007
Go ahead, sweetheart.
That's a great idea.

25:16.081 --> 25:18.777
He'll be obliged
to save you that way.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.876
And if he doesn't...
lf, you know...
Then I'll notify your parents.

25:52.350 --> 25:53.339
SONDRA: (GASPS) Help!

25:54.352 --> 25:56.047
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

25:59.391 --> 26:00.380
Help!

26:03.395 --> 26:05.022
(SONDRA GASPING)

26:10.101 --> 26:12.262
(SONDRA COUGHING)
It's all right. Shh.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.232
It's okay.
There you go.

26:16.608 --> 26:18.200
Are you all right? Okay.

26:18.443 --> 26:19.432
I'm sorry.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.546
(COUGHING)
All right, here.
Here we are.

26:21.646 --> 26:23.580
Here we are. You all right?
Thank you.

26:23.882 --> 26:26.112
You okay?
Yes, thank you very much.

26:26.184 --> 26:27.947
Sorry.
It's my pleasure.
Here, let me help you out.

26:28.219 --> 26:29.208
(GRUNTS)

26:30.221 --> 26:31.848
I'm not a very good swimmer.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.588
(COUGHING)
It's all right.

26:33.692 --> 26:34.954
My leg cramped.

26:35.026 --> 26:36.084
Your leg?
Here, stretch it out.

26:36.161 --> 26:37.219
Oh.
That's it.

26:37.295 --> 26:38.557
Thank you.
No problem.

26:38.797 --> 26:41.231
Listen, you should always
do a little stretching
before you go in.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.858
You know,
that way you won't cramp.
Oh, thank you very much.

26:44.002 --> 26:46.470
I haven't been swimming
in so long.

26:47.138 --> 26:48.503
You're a new face.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.398
Have you
just become a member?

26:50.475 --> 26:52.875
Oh, no,
I'm a guest of the Fultons.

26:53.011 --> 26:55.206
Oh, right, Jack Fulton.
Yes, lovely chap.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.447
I'm Peter Lyman, by the way.
Hi, Son...

26:58.950 --> 26:59.939
Sond...

27:01.519 --> 27:02.645
Jade.

27:02.921 --> 27:04.115
Jade Spence.

27:04.389 --> 27:06.254
Jade Julliard Spence.

27:06.925 --> 27:09.223
That's a very pretty name.
Thank you.

27:09.361 --> 27:12.819
Yes, we're the Spences of...
Of Palm Beach.

27:13.298 --> 27:16.028
Oh, not the same Spences
who own the shipping line?

27:16.301 --> 27:17.632
No, no, no.

27:17.769 --> 27:21.671
My father's into
silver and gold

27:21.740 --> 27:23.674
and drilling.
Ah.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.033
For wells.

27:25.377 --> 27:27.402
What are you doing
in London?

27:27.912 --> 27:30.346
I'm here visiting friends
in Holland Park.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.646
Oh, good.
What do you do, Jade?

27:32.751 --> 27:35.515
Well, I am an actress.

27:35.587 --> 27:36.849
Oh, really?
Mmm-hmm.

27:37.122 --> 27:39.317
Yes, actually
I'm up for the part of Desiree

27:39.391 --> 27:41.416
in the new Mike Tinsley film.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.324
Oh, well, you're certainly
beautiful enough.

27:43.461 --> 27:45.053
(GIGGLING) Thank you.

27:45.196 --> 27:46.959
Look, Jade,

27:47.365 --> 27:48.423
if you're not busy,

27:48.500 --> 27:51.264
my father's giving
a garden party
at the estate on Sunday

27:51.336 --> 27:52.598
and I'd love you to come.

27:52.704 --> 27:55.798
I'd be very happy
to be your date
and show you around.

27:55.874 --> 27:58.741
The English countryside
is very lovely
this time of the year.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.971
Sounds fantastic.
Good.

28:01.079 --> 28:03.513
Do you mind
if I bring my father?

28:03.782 --> 28:05.079
Your father?

28:05.183 --> 28:07.276
Oh, look!
There he is right now.

28:07.752 --> 28:08.741
Ah.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.785
I was in the lounge.
I heard you drowning.

28:10.855 --> 28:14.052
I finished my tea and scones
and came immediately.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.853
SONDRA: Dad,
this is Peter Lyman,

28:15.927 --> 28:17.622
who was nice enough
to rescue me.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.685
Dad?

28:22.834 --> 28:24.563
Yes, of course, child!

28:24.636 --> 28:27.730
She cannot swim.
The girl cannot swim.

28:27.839 --> 28:31.002
Like a lead weight,
she sinks to the bottom
all the time.

28:31.142 --> 28:35.044
It's a family trait.
Lack of buoyancy, or...
Her siblings have it as well.

28:35.113 --> 28:37.980
Yes, well, listen,
pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Spence, right?

28:38.049 --> 28:39.073
Yes.

28:39.150 --> 28:41.550
Yes, and I'll see you
on Sunday at the estate.

28:41.619 --> 28:43.814
Oh, great.
Sunday? What's Sunday?
Not a fox hunt?

28:43.955 --> 28:46.947
(CHUCKLING)
No. No, Dad.
I'll explain it to you later.

28:47.092 --> 28:49.083
Listen, I'll leave
all the information
at the desk, all right?

28:49.160 --> 28:50.559
Hey, come, child.

28:52.797 --> 28:55.732
What kind of idiot are you?
Not a fox hunt?

28:55.834 --> 28:58.598
I'd like
to talk to these people
in their own terms.

28:58.803 --> 29:01.294
And, oh,
thanks for telling him
I'm your father.

29:01.439 --> 29:04.203
Oh, incidentally, he thinks
my name is Jade Spence,

29:04.275 --> 29:05.799
so that makes you
Mr. Spence.

29:05.877 --> 29:09.040
Wait a minute, I... This is
too tricky. I don't want to
go ahead with this.

29:09.214 --> 29:12.274
Why? What's wrong with you?
Your whole life is deception.
You're a magician.

29:12.383 --> 29:15.375
Yes, I'm a magician
and I want to stay a magician.
Can I have a Coke please?

29:15.453 --> 29:17.853
I don't want to get sued
or deported

29:17.922 --> 29:20.254
or arrested
for stalking somebody.

29:20.325 --> 29:22.452
This is a big guy
you're dealing with.

29:22.527 --> 29:25.325
This is a big story,
no kidding.
That's what Joe Strombel said.

29:25.396 --> 29:28.160
That's why he returned,
you know. This is
his last big scoop.

29:28.233 --> 29:29.461
Hey. What do I care
about Joe Strombel?

29:29.534 --> 29:33.231
Suddenly I'm taking direction
from a hunk of ectoplasm?

29:33.338 --> 29:35.272
This could be
very big for my career.

29:35.607 --> 29:39.338
Your career's fine.
You're on the college <i>Bugle,</i>
or whatever it is.

29:39.410 --> 29:41.002
You got years for scoops.

29:41.112 --> 29:42.704
You know what?
Forget you, all right.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.773
I'll do this on my own.
I don't need you.
Go back to your card tricks.

29:45.850 --> 29:47.613
I didn't say
I wouldn't help you.

29:47.685 --> 29:50.245
You know, I just...
It has to be done properly.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.647
You know, we gotta
put our heads together.

29:52.857 --> 29:55.724
If we put
our heads together,
you'll hear a hollow noise.

30:14.345 --> 30:16.677
Look at this place.
All it's missing is a moat.

30:21.686 --> 30:24.348
Ooh! Hey,
I could get used to this.

30:25.023 --> 30:26.251
Look at this.

30:28.226 --> 30:31.161
SONDRA: Oh, there he is.
Remember, Jade Spence.

30:31.362 --> 30:32.693
Jade...
Jade, who?

30:33.464 --> 30:35.295
(MUMBLING)

30:35.667 --> 30:37.066
Ah.
PETER: There you are.

30:37.135 --> 30:39.933
Hello.
How are you? Welcome,
Mr. Spence and Jade.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.164
Mr. Spence.

30:41.239 --> 30:44.675
You look stunning. Stunning.
Oh, thank you.
It's beautiful here.

30:44.742 --> 30:45.834
Thank you. Thank you. Yes.

30:45.910 --> 30:48.401
It's been in the family
for years. About 400 years.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.413
It's a little stuffy
for my taste, but...
Oh.

30:50.481 --> 30:52.779
She said,
"All that's missing
is a moat."

30:52.917 --> 30:55.886
Right.
(CHUCKLES) I love that.
I love the moat line.

30:55.954 --> 30:58.980
"All that's missing
is a moat." Beautiful.
Ah, this is my father.

30:59.257 --> 31:01.521
Father, Stephen Lyman,
this is... These are
my friends from America

31:01.593 --> 31:02.924
I was telling you about.
Oh, Lord Lyman.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.016
Jade Spence, Mr. Spence.

31:04.195 --> 31:05.628
How are you?
Hello.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.996
Curtsey, curtsey, curtsey,
curtsey, curtsey, curtsey,
I've never met a Lord before.

31:09.067 --> 31:10.159
How exciting!

31:10.235 --> 31:13.068
No, but there was
that Earl that we...
There was that Earl.

31:13.204 --> 31:14.865
I do hope
you're enjoying yourself.

31:14.939 --> 31:16.873
Peter, why don't you
show them around?

31:17.008 --> 31:18.475
Absolutely.
Would you like that?

31:18.610 --> 31:20.635
Oh, it...
Charmed, I'm sure.

31:20.778 --> 31:23.008
Should we hit
the buffet table first though?

31:23.081 --> 31:24.446
No, Dad.
Because the stuff
looks great.

31:24.515 --> 31:26.005
Remember,
we wanted to look around.

31:26.084 --> 31:27.915
(CHUCKLING)
Yes, of course, of course,
blessed offspring.

31:27.986 --> 31:30.284
Why don't we get a drink
and then we'll start inside?

31:30.455 --> 31:31.854
SONDRA: Oh, okay.
Come.

31:36.628 --> 31:39.461
Yes, I love this room here.
We often spend
evenings in here.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.054
The English countryside!

31:41.232 --> 31:44.395
It's elegant,
yet understated. I like that.

31:44.535 --> 31:46.002
You've done wonders
with the place.

31:46.204 --> 31:47.831
(CHUCKLES)
It brings to mind Trollope.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.869
Oh, do you enjoy
reading Trollope, too?

31:50.008 --> 31:52.499
No, no, not the author.
This was a girl I knew.

31:52.944 --> 31:55.742
Well, come. Let's go upstairs
and have a look at the view.

31:55.813 --> 31:56.802
Oh.

31:56.948 --> 31:59.610
Would you quit fooling around!
What's wrong with you?

31:59.717 --> 32:01.810
Try to pick up clues,
try to remember things.
I'm charming him.

32:01.886 --> 32:04.354
I remember. I got
a mnemonic system that I use.

32:04.455 --> 32:06.446
I use images, it's a trick.
Uh-huh, yeah.

32:06.557 --> 32:08.047
Say I want to remember
this ashtray.

32:08.126 --> 32:12.358
I think of, like, 50 ashtrays
dancing on a desert island
in hula skirts or something

32:12.597 --> 32:14.724
and then I remember.
I can call it
to mind whenever I...

32:14.799 --> 32:16.198
Where are you going?

32:16.567 --> 32:18.535
This is
one of the drawing rooms.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.931
Wow, this is
really beautiful, isn't it?

32:21.005 --> 32:23.303
Oh, here we have...
This is my great-grandfather.

32:23.408 --> 32:26.309
There's grandfather
and his wife, Lady Hayden.

32:26.377 --> 32:29.540
Reminds me of
the portrait of Aunt Hillary
in the library, no?

32:29.981 --> 32:34.281
Game woman, Hillary.
Suffragette, I believe.
Yeah. Diphtheria took her.

32:34.585 --> 32:37.213
Or perhaps it was elm blight.

32:37.855 --> 32:39.049
Come on, Dad.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.755
SONDRA: Oh,
this is just beautiful. Wow.

32:41.826 --> 32:44.351
Yes. I love the lake.
Do either of you fish?

32:44.429 --> 32:46.522
No, no, never have.
Oh, I'll have to teach you.

32:46.731 --> 32:49.029
I've taken some salmon,
you know. Organic.

32:49.233 --> 32:51.793
Yes, me, too.
I fly fish a little. But...

32:52.570 --> 32:54.162
So, Jade, do you
enjoy concerts?

32:54.238 --> 32:55.933
I'm very big
on the Philharmonic.

32:56.007 --> 32:57.406
We sponsor, in fact.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.602
I used to play the violin,
very, very badly.

32:59.844 --> 33:04.213
But I have a number of...
Well, actually quite a large
musical collection.

33:04.282 --> 33:05.977
Do you play an instrument,
either of you?

33:06.050 --> 33:07.347
Because we have
these lovely music gatherings.

33:07.418 --> 33:08.612
I do. Yes, I play the...

33:08.686 --> 33:09.675
(GRUNTS)

33:10.288 --> 33:13.223
Various classics,
you know, Noel Coward
and Shakespeare and...

33:13.758 --> 33:17.091
Right.
We gave her piano lessons
when she was a little girl,

33:17.161 --> 33:19.959
but her fingers
were just too stubby. So...

33:20.565 --> 33:22.294
Yes, what about you,
Mr. Spence?

33:22.734 --> 33:24.292
Well, I play the blues harp.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.732
It's a little metal thing
you put in your mouth

33:26.871 --> 33:29.101
and makes a twanging sound.
Very musical.
Yes, yes.

33:29.173 --> 33:32.404
Used to be called
the Jew's harp, but you know
how those people are.

33:32.477 --> 33:35.071
The slightest hint
of anti-Semitism
and they write letters.

33:35.279 --> 33:38.646
I would love it if you could
teach me how to fly fish.
That would be great.

33:38.716 --> 33:39.910
Oh, it would be my pleasure.

33:41.252 --> 33:44.483
Okay, I want you to
watch me very closely. Pay
very strict attention here.

33:44.622 --> 33:46.055
Now I want you
to take a card.

33:46.124 --> 33:47.614
Take any card you like.
You got it?

33:47.692 --> 33:49.387
Go ahead, sweetheart. Take it.
You got it?
Mmm-hmm.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.087
Now put it
in your pocketbook.
Put the card...

33:51.162 --> 33:52.356
She's gonna put the card
in her pocketbook.

33:52.430 --> 33:54.557
You got it? All right,
now tell everybody
what the card was.

33:54.999 --> 33:56.489
It was the six of hearts.
Six of hearts.

33:56.634 --> 33:57.623
Can I ask you a question?

33:57.702 --> 33:59.727
Was it
this six of hearts?

34:00.071 --> 34:01.265
But I just put that
in my bag.

34:01.339 --> 34:03.569
Well, check your card.
Check your card.

34:04.275 --> 34:05.264
It's amazing!

34:06.110 --> 34:07.771
You're
a wonderful sport, Claire.

34:07.845 --> 34:09.574
I mean that sincerely.
God bless you.

34:09.647 --> 34:12.047
You're a very sweet woman,
and this has been
a great group.

34:12.150 --> 34:15.313
From the bottom of my heart,
I say this with
all due respect.

34:15.553 --> 34:18.989
You're a wonderful... A credit
to your race and a
magnificent group of people.

34:19.056 --> 34:21.821
You know,
I must find out who
does the hedges here.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.588
Back home,
my topiary moose

34:23.661 --> 34:25.958
is starting
to look a little shabby
around the antlers.

34:26.030 --> 34:27.827
(LAUGHING) What do you do,
Mr. Spence?

34:27.899 --> 34:29.799
(STUTTERING) Me?
I'm in real estate.

34:30.134 --> 34:31.567
I'm sorry, I'm in oil!
I'm in oil.

34:31.636 --> 34:33.297
(STUTTERING) I was in
real estate,

34:33.371 --> 34:38.206
but, you know, land is
so difficult to come by now,
especially outdoors.

34:38.275 --> 34:39.436
It's become a problem.

34:39.510 --> 34:42.172
Incidentally,
I accept your invitation.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.110
I will play poker
this weekend.

34:44.748 --> 34:48.549
Now that I've seen
how good you are
at cards, can we trust you?

34:48.719 --> 34:50.083
(LAUGHING)

34:51.255 --> 34:53.917
Tell me about yourself, Peter.
This is all so new to me.

34:53.991 --> 34:55.514
Well, what would you
like to know?

34:55.726 --> 34:59.093
Well, I don't know.
Anything you'd care to reveal.

34:59.330 --> 35:01.992
You know, your hopes,
your dreams.

35:03.267 --> 35:07.101
Well, I come
from a privileged family,
as I'm sure you can tell.

35:07.338 --> 35:10.034
It was always
decided one day
I would enter politics.

35:10.608 --> 35:14.567
My hobbies are polo
and... Oh, I own
some racehorses.

35:14.645 --> 35:17.239
Hmm.
So, how's that for a start?

35:17.448 --> 35:19.678
(CHUCKLES)
And what are
your hopes and dreams?

35:20.251 --> 35:24.278
I like to dance
and visit museums

35:24.355 --> 35:26.550
and, oh,
I can cook Chinese food.
Ah.

35:26.824 --> 35:29.019
If you know any good
Chinese restaurants...

35:30.394 --> 35:35.127
Oh, I've gotten very
interested in New Age
phenomena recently.

35:35.199 --> 35:36.257
Like what?

35:37.168 --> 35:41.332
You know,
mystical things like

35:42.006 --> 35:46.739
astrology and crystals
and Tarot.
Mmm-hmm.

35:46.944 --> 35:49.071
Do you know anything
about Tarot cards?

35:49.313 --> 35:51.474
Not really.
I'm more scientific-minded.

35:51.549 --> 35:53.039
I find that if...

35:54.152 --> 35:56.245
What are you staring at?

35:57.121 --> 35:58.679
Hmm? Oh.

35:59.090 --> 36:00.853
You have wonderful enamel.

36:01.292 --> 36:03.988
(CHUCKLING) Thank you.
Thank you.

36:04.061 --> 36:06.655
You know, I'd love to take
you dancing one night.
I'm a good dancer.

36:07.064 --> 36:09.259
Oh, I would love that.
That would be great.

36:09.700 --> 36:11.031
Can I confess something?

36:11.402 --> 36:12.391
Sure.

36:12.537 --> 36:13.799
I just love
an American accent,

36:13.871 --> 36:16.066
and I find
much of what you say
very amusing.

36:16.274 --> 36:17.263
Oh.

36:17.441 --> 36:19.204
I'll take that
as a compliment.

36:19.277 --> 36:21.040
And since you like
Chinese food,

36:21.646 --> 36:22.977
I'm gonna have
my new secretary

36:23.047 --> 36:25.174
send you a list
of the great ones in town.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.783
Oh, you have a new secretary?
Oh, yes.

36:27.885 --> 36:30.547
Yes, I'm breaking in
someone new.

36:30.621 --> 36:34.148
My previous secretary died,
a young woman, just very
suddenly of a blood clot.

36:34.225 --> 36:35.317
It was awful.

36:36.494 --> 36:38.394
Did they do an autopsy?

36:39.497 --> 36:41.397
How did we
get on to this morbid subject?

36:41.465 --> 36:43.365
So, you've never seen
a real English garden before?

36:43.434 --> 36:45.698
Come.
I have a couple of treasures.

37:10.494 --> 37:14.123
Would I offend you
if I told you something?
Probably not.

37:14.699 --> 37:18.601
You're very...
Very different from
the women I usually meet.

37:18.669 --> 37:19.658
Hmm.

37:20.104 --> 37:21.332
That's a good thing.

37:21.405 --> 37:24.568
Well, I just can't seem to get
the vision of you in your
swimsuit out of my mind.

37:24.642 --> 37:25.973
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

37:26.143 --> 37:27.201
It was marked down.

37:27.311 --> 37:30.007
(CHUCKLES) See, that...
Now that's exactly
what I mean.

37:30.081 --> 37:33.380
You just have this very direct
and informal way about you.

37:33.451 --> 37:36.147
It's...
You take after your father.
Mmm-hmm. Great.

37:36.854 --> 37:39.914
And you have
a very sensual quality.

37:40.124 --> 37:42.115
It's... But I'm sure
you've been told that.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.553
Wow. You work really fast.

37:44.895 --> 37:47.090
Oh, God. Am I
overbearingly aggressive?
I'll stop.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.562
Oh, no, don't!

37:48.633 --> 37:50.464
You just
were getting warmed up.

37:51.002 --> 37:52.264
Are you romantic by nature?

37:52.403 --> 37:54.530
I mean, I won't say,
"Do you believe in
love at first sight?"

37:54.605 --> 37:56.197
Because that's
a cliché but...

37:57.908 --> 37:59.967
Have you ever had
an experience

38:00.244 --> 38:02.235
where a bell goes off
just right away?

38:02.913 --> 38:04.778
(LAUGHS) Sorry.
I need those.

38:05.216 --> 38:06.410
You see,
I can't wear contacts.

38:06.484 --> 38:08.679
I don't like
to put my finger
on my eyeball.

38:08.786 --> 38:10.651
(BOTH LAUGHING)

38:17.995 --> 38:21.089
Well, goodbye. We must meet
for tea and crumpets again.

38:21.165 --> 38:22.154
WOMAN: We really must.

38:22.233 --> 38:23.461
Ta-ta!

38:24.302 --> 38:26.566
I could have strangled you
if you didn't shut up!

38:26.871 --> 38:29.066
And stop telling people
I sprang from your loins.

38:29.173 --> 38:32.006
I'm trying to cement the fact
that I'm your father!

38:32.076 --> 38:34.943
That guy was so fantastic.
I can't imagine
he'd do anything bad.

38:35.012 --> 38:36.980
This guy
is not a serial killer,
believe me.

38:37.114 --> 38:41.073
I'd be very surprised
if he even killed one person.

38:41.452 --> 38:43.079
He asked me to go dancing
next week.

38:43.254 --> 38:47.247
That's a perfect strategy!
You worm your way in
like a rodent or a roach

38:47.425 --> 38:49.416
and as the crumbs
fall off the table,

38:49.493 --> 38:52.587
you collect them and
we analyze them. Aha! <i>Voilà!</i>
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

38:52.663 --> 38:55.530
Look at this. Look at this.
Look what I got.
"Betty G."

38:55.599 --> 38:57.089
Yeah.
What is this?

38:57.168 --> 38:58.726
It's a doodle.
He doodled it!

38:59.136 --> 39:01.331
How do you know
he doodled it? How do
you know this is his?

39:01.439 --> 39:02.633
What do you mean,
how do I know it's his?

39:02.707 --> 39:04.231
I stole it out of
his overnight bag.

39:04.308 --> 39:06.071
What the hell
is wrong with you, Sidney?

39:06.143 --> 39:07.371
It's a clue!
It's not a clue.

39:07.445 --> 39:08.912
We're hard up for clues.
It's not a clue.

39:08.979 --> 39:11.777
What does it mean?
It could be his aunt,
it could be his travel agent.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.283
I'm late for dinner. You want
to come in and eat something?
No.

39:14.485 --> 39:15.975
(CHUCKLES) No, thank you.

39:21.325 --> 39:22.622
Take a seat right over there.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.088
MAN 1: Okay.

39:30.601 --> 39:33.297
Peter called.
He's going to be late.
He said to start without him.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.336
Oh, well, come on
then, let's play.
That's what we're here for.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.032
Okay.

39:40.811 --> 39:42.608

short, little guy.

You're out?
This is it?

MAN 3: Anybody else?

39:46.617 --> 39:48.050
You're still in?

39:48.152 --> 39:51.349
So sorry, old chaps.
I was completely
bogged down at the office.

39:51.422 --> 39:52.582
Okay.

39:52.656 --> 39:53.884
All right, who's winning?

39:53.958 --> 39:55.858
Mr. Spence
is a good poker player, Peter.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.484
Yes, I might have known.

39:57.628 --> 40:01.689
Actually,
I bought my first Reuben's
with poker winnings.

40:02.032 --> 40:03.829
You bought a Rubens painting?

40:04.368 --> 40:06.461
Not a painting.
A sandwich.

40:07.371 --> 40:08.702
I could use a drink.

40:09.106 --> 40:11.768
He asked me
if I believed in love
at first sight.

40:11.842 --> 40:13.776
(EXCLAIMS)
How sweet is that?
So naive.

40:13.844 --> 40:15.209
Well, I hope
you told him yes.

40:15.279 --> 40:16.769
I told him
we had nothing in common.

40:16.847 --> 40:19.008
We come from
completely different
backgrounds.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.607
I think
he likes that or something.

40:20.684 --> 40:24.484
But what about the story
you're writing on him?
What is that all about?

40:27.892 --> 40:28.984
Sondra?

40:34.799 --> 40:37.700
"Mary Thompson,
a short-haired brunette,

40:37.768 --> 40:41.534
"was strangled
at Falconberg Place
last night at 9:30."

40:41.639 --> 40:44.665
"Next to the body
of the short-haired
brunette prostitute,

40:44.742 --> 40:47.233
"was the hangman card
from the Tarot deck."

40:48.078 --> 40:51.570
Hey, what time did you say
Peter arrived at the
poker game last night?

40:51.949 --> 40:55.077
If you're asking me,
did he have time
to strangle somebody

40:55.152 --> 40:57.746
and make the card game,
yes, he had plenty of time.

40:58.989 --> 41:01.287
I got to let
my feelings subside

41:01.358 --> 41:03.326
and probe deeper
into this case.

41:03.494 --> 41:04.791
What does that mean?

41:05.196 --> 41:08.256
Well, it means that we know
where his family lives,
we know his social circle,

41:08.332 --> 41:11.824
but we don't know
what his house looks like.
I want to get a look at that.

41:18.609 --> 41:19.803
PETER: Here we are.

41:23.047 --> 41:25.641
Wow.
This is really nice.
Thank you. Yes.

41:26.951 --> 41:28.418
Do you do
a lot of entertaining?

41:28.519 --> 41:30.453
I'm embarrassed
to say that I do.

41:30.521 --> 41:33.217
You must think
I'm an empty socialite.
Much of it's political.

41:33.290 --> 41:35.485
Oh, no.
I think you're swell.

That's a lovely painting.

41:41.699 --> 41:45.396
Oh, I recognize that
from my art history books.

41:45.469 --> 41:46.936
PETER: Oh, really?
Yes. Henry Moore.

41:47.004 --> 41:49.734
In fact, it was a present
from Henry Moore to my father.

41:50.508 --> 41:54.274
Oh, it's very beautiful.
Is it Roman, or Greek,
or something like that?

41:54.378 --> 41:58.405
It's Roman, in fact.
Second century A.D.

41:58.482 --> 41:59.813
You have good taste.

And a Stradivarius.

Oh, you play these violins?
Oh, me? God, no. No, no.

42:45.863 --> 42:49.060

for Wendy Beamish.

43:16.961 --> 43:19.521
Fantastic. I love you, Wendy.
I really do.

43:19.663 --> 43:21.221
Is it your first time
on stage?
Yes. Yes.

43:21.332 --> 43:24.563
I love this woman
from the bottom of my heart.
I mean that sincerely.

43:24.702 --> 43:28.934
You're an incredible woman
and I say that
with all due respect, Wendy.

43:29.139 --> 43:31.903
Wendy, have you ever been
dematerialized before?
No, I haven't.

43:31.976 --> 43:34.467
Ever had your
molecules broken up?
No, no, I've haven't.

43:34.878 --> 43:37.244
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
She's nervous.
Don't be nervous, sweetheart.

43:37.314 --> 43:38.872
This is not gonna hurt much.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.509
Get into the box.
Get into the dematerializer.

43:41.585 --> 43:43.815
Are you in there?
You comfortable?
I'm fine.

43:43.887 --> 43:46.219
Okay, okay, stay calm.
Stay calm.

43:46.790 --> 43:49.623
Can you hear me, Wendy?
You feel the molecules
evaporating?

43:50.127 --> 43:51.651
Let me hear from you, honey!

43:59.303 --> 44:01.897
Remember these numbers.
16, 21, 12.
What?

16 blue horses.

44:12.983 --> 44:15.383
Twenty-one jet planes.

44:15.452 --> 44:18.979
(STUTTERING) And 12 midgets.
12 spinning midgets.

44:22.092 --> 44:24.560
PETER: That was as great
as I imagined it would be.

44:25.396 --> 44:26.556
You look beautiful.

44:27.331 --> 44:28.423
And pensive.

44:29.199 --> 44:30.689
SONDRA: No, not pensive.

44:31.468 --> 44:32.457
Just confused.

44:33.170 --> 44:35.695
Women after lovemaking,
it's always so complicated.

44:37.808 --> 44:40.641
Hey, I love your aftershave.
What is it?
It's Yardley.

44:40.711 --> 44:44.169
I first used it when I was 16
and never changed.
I'm a very loyal soul.

44:44.248 --> 44:46.216
Come here.
Do you have to put them on?

44:46.450 --> 44:49.442
Well, they're quite sexy.
God, what makes
you smell so sweet?

44:49.553 --> 44:50.747
Oh, you like it?

44:51.188 --> 44:52.485
Just some fragrance.

44:54.024 --> 44:55.013
Right.

44:56.026 --> 44:58.153
Where are you going?
I have an idea.

44:59.229 --> 45:01.959
I think it's time to celebrate
with some champagne.

45:04.868 --> 45:08.133
I want you to stay.
I make a mean scrambled egg.

45:08.338 --> 45:10.829
(GIGGLES)
Stay.

46:05.262 --> 46:06.889
PETER: That's my mother.

46:07.397 --> 46:10.958
Oh, she's very attractive.

46:11.435 --> 46:14.666
Yes, she was very beautiful,
but quite difficult.

46:15.372 --> 46:17.033
Difficult?
How?

46:18.242 --> 46:19.231
Unfaithful.

46:19.943 --> 46:23.811
Say, can you please stay?
Nothing would
please me more. Come on.

46:24.081 --> 46:26.515
I really can't.
Oh, why not?

46:26.750 --> 46:30.550
(STUTTERING) My father.
He's feeling not that great.

46:30.621 --> 46:32.816
Nothing serious?
No, no, nothing.

46:33.157 --> 46:35.057
Just a tooth problem.

46:35.125 --> 46:37.616
You know,
a little sensitivity
in lower seven.

46:37.828 --> 46:39.193
I really should go.

46:41.465 --> 46:42.625
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

46:45.969 --> 46:48.529
Oh. So, let me
get back to the story.

46:49.039 --> 46:52.907
(STUTTERING) I'm on stage.
I'm doing the
dematerializer trick

46:52.976 --> 46:54.967
with this chick
from Manchester.

46:55.145 --> 46:57.511
I don't know
where they get these people,

46:57.581 --> 46:59.845
but she looked like
Sitting Bull.

47:00.017 --> 47:02.508
And I got her in the thing,
and I vanish her

47:02.586 --> 47:06.044
and everything
goes according to plan
exactly and she's gone.

47:06.423 --> 47:09.290
And suddenly,
Strombel appears.
What?

47:09.459 --> 47:12.860
Yes, Strombel's in there!
I got a tremendous hand
from the audience.

47:12.963 --> 47:14.658
I wish
I could do it every night!

47:14.731 --> 47:15.823
What did he say?

47:16.033 --> 47:19.093
He gave me
the combination to a safe.

47:19.169 --> 47:21.194
What safe, I have no idea.

47:21.839 --> 47:23.272
I didn't see any safe.

47:24.107 --> 47:29.067
Well, did you
accomplish anything besides
maybe a possible pregnancy?

47:29.146 --> 47:30.511
I'll tell you what I did see.

47:30.581 --> 47:34.073
His mother, Lady Eleanor,
has short-cut, brunette hair.

47:34.618 --> 47:36.609
(STUTTERING) Yeah,
but not a hooker?

47:38.889 --> 47:40.652
No, Sidney,
she's not a hooker!

47:40.757 --> 47:43.282
I hardly think so.
She's practically royalty.

47:43.527 --> 47:45.654
Christ,
you amaze me sometimes.
Your brain!

47:45.729 --> 47:49.028
(STUTTERING)
Back off. You know,
you're getting so upset.

47:49.099 --> 47:53.035
I'm just trying
to figure out
the various ramifications.

47:53.103 --> 47:54.297
I just don't like
this whole thing!

47:54.371 --> 47:56.566
I feel disgusting,
all right, it's awful.

47:56.740 --> 47:58.173
I don't like
the whole process.

47:58.242 --> 47:59.641
Yeah, you want to think
he's innocent.

47:59.710 --> 48:01.177
What's so bad about that, huh?

48:01.278 --> 48:03.542
Jesus, this guy
must be some lover, you know.

48:03.614 --> 48:06.412
I mean, all of a sudden
you're ready to dump
the whole story.

48:06.483 --> 48:09.213
I must find out
what breakfast cereal he eats.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.689
What am I talking about?
There's a combination
on the door

48:12.756 --> 48:15.554
where he keeps his precious
musical instruments.

48:15.759 --> 48:17.021
Okay,
so there is a combination!

48:17.094 --> 48:19.119
I just got
to get in that room.

48:19.196 --> 48:20.493
Do you have the combination?

48:20.564 --> 48:22.794
We're not gonna break
into his room if that's
what you're thinking.

You gotta have the com...
I got to get in there.
No, no.

No, no, we're not
going to do this because
it's not legal... You...

Sondra, what's wrong with you?

the son of a Lord!

the Tower of London
and behead us!

is Jade Spence?

Yeah, I'm Jade Spence.

on Saturday and
he wants me to come.

I'll have to buy a dress.

49:00.137 --> 49:01.866
Well, he certainly
seems smitten with you.

49:01.972 --> 49:03.963
If he's smitten with anyone,
it's Jade Spence.

investigative reporter

with the object
of her investigation.

I'm going to show you
a little thing.

I want you
to think of a card. Just think
of one of those cards.

49:26.129 --> 49:27.391
Any one you want.
You got it?

49:27.464 --> 49:30.433
All right, now, are you
happening to be thinking
of the seven of spades?

49:31.702 --> 49:35.604
That's amazing!
How do you do that?
Just a little hobby of mine.

49:35.672 --> 49:37.606
You know, I wish
I had more time to practice,

49:37.908 --> 49:40.103
but, what with my oil wells,
you know, I never
get around to it.

very beautiful.

You met my daughter?
Yes.

Yes, we're very proud of her.
She's a lovely girl.
Overcame a great handicap.

49:46.616 --> 49:48.811
Yeah. You know, she was
learning disabled.

49:49.186 --> 49:51.586
Her mother and I took
her to many specialists,
you know.

Now she's practically normal,
you know.

I'm an Aquarian.

Do you mean my religion?
Yeah, your persuasion.

I'm a Christian. What are you?
Yes, are you?

Me, I was born into
the Hebrew persuasion,

but, when I got older,
I converted to narcissism.

Hmm?

to talk to you right now.

to pull some quarters
out of Mrs. Quincy's nose.

I need to talk to you.

Would you stop doing
those nitwit tricks?

You're supposed to be
a dignified businessman.

The hobby of a rich merchant.

open the music room door.

in a minute. You brought
the combination, right?

in my other jacket.

Yes. And...

and get it then.

because the other

a good time?

with a drink all night.

55:33.730 --> 55:35.288
Can you stay the night,
please?
What?

55:35.598 --> 55:36.826
Come on.
No, I can't.

55:36.900 --> 55:38.595
Why not?
My father.

55:38.668 --> 55:40.693
Oh, come on, I'll have
my driver take him home.

55:40.770 --> 55:42.601
No.
I can't let you go.
You're too beautiful.

55:42.739 --> 55:44.764
(MOANING)
Look at you. I can't.

56:59.449 --> 57:01.178
(SIGHING)

57:39.456 --> 57:40.548
Jade?

57:48.031 --> 57:49.259
SONDRA: Oh.
Jade.

57:51.267 --> 57:53.326
Jade, it's 4:00 a.m.

57:53.436 --> 57:54.903
What are you doing?

57:55.405 --> 57:57.430
I couldn't sleep,

57:57.507 --> 58:00.442
so I thought
maybe some milk.

58:00.944 --> 58:01.933
Hmm.

58:04.481 --> 58:06.540
Jade, can I ask you something?
Mmm-hmm.

58:09.853 --> 58:12.686
Would you consider
not going home at the end
of the summer?

58:14.157 --> 58:16.523
SID: I don't understand,
what more proof do you need?

58:16.593 --> 58:17.992
What are you gonna tell
the police?

58:18.161 --> 58:20.857
The guy
owns a deck of Tarot cards.
That's not a crime.

58:21.197 --> 58:22.994
I mean, what, he was late
for a poker game?

58:23.066 --> 58:25.296
I'm sure he's smart enough
to have an alibi.

58:25.435 --> 58:28.131
What are we left with?
His mother has
short-cut, brunette hair.

58:28.204 --> 58:30.104
I mean, look,
if we blow the whistle
on this guy...

58:30.173 --> 58:32.641
I know. I understand.
...and he's innocent
and we can't make the story...

58:32.709 --> 58:34.438
Then he realizes
that you're, you know,

58:34.511 --> 58:37.537
you're a pushy little phony
who's been playing him
for a sucker

58:37.614 --> 58:39.980
and he dumps you,
you know. I get it.

58:40.049 --> 58:42.313
All right. All I'm saying,
is that in order to make
an accusation,

58:42.385 --> 58:43.409
we gotta have proof.

58:43.520 --> 58:45.920
Especially
about Lord Lyman's son.

58:46.089 --> 58:48.148
You don't make an accusation.

58:48.224 --> 58:50.556
We can phone in
an anonymous tip.

58:50.727 --> 58:53.252
You know how many crank tips
the papers say the police get?

58:53.329 --> 58:55.297
You're gonna phone one in
on Peter Lyman!

58:55.365 --> 58:57.390
They'll hang up on you
mid-sentence.

58:57.934 --> 58:59.162
Besides,
if the story's true,

58:59.235 --> 59:00.668
I want to be the one
to break it.

59:00.737 --> 59:02.170
You know
what Joe Strombel said?

59:02.272 --> 59:04.672
He said,
"Get it first,
but first get it right."

59:06.242 --> 59:07.368
Happy birthday.

59:08.912 --> 59:10.402
Wow, thank you.

59:11.247 --> 59:12.908
What's up?
You look so sullen.

59:13.783 --> 59:15.978
No, I'm not. I just...

59:18.021 --> 59:19.682
I get sad around birthdays.

59:19.756 --> 59:21.690
Oh, yes, well,
I can understand that,

59:21.758 --> 59:24.192
but I think we're both
still young enough
to enjoy the gifts.

59:24.260 --> 59:25.352
Come on, open it.

59:25.995 --> 59:26.984
Okay.

59:29.699 --> 59:31.667
Oh, wow, it's beautiful.

59:31.768 --> 59:33.201
You like it?
I love it.

59:33.269 --> 59:34.702
Good. Here, allow me.

59:35.705 --> 59:36.694
Gosh.

59:38.174 --> 59:39.607
You shouldn't have.

59:39.676 --> 59:40.802
I wanted to.

59:41.411 --> 59:45.643
Hey, hey,
are you crying?
No, I'm too tough to cry.

59:45.748 --> 59:46.737
Oh.

59:46.816 --> 59:50.217
Though my nasal passages
do become congested
when I'm sad.

59:50.420 --> 59:53.116
Oh, don't be sad.
It's your birthday. Hmm?

59:53.756 --> 59:55.849
Oh, I wish I could
celebrate with you tonight.

59:55.925 --> 59:57.916
I just have to go out of town
for a few days.

59:58.127 --> 59:59.116
Really?

59:59.195 --> 01:00:02.130
Yes, I just have
some business to take care of.

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:04.824
But we'll celebrate
when I get back, all right?
Okay.

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:08.928
Thank you so much
for the present.
It's beautiful.

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:10.529
I'll think about you
whenever I wear it.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:11.596
(CHUCKLES)

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.234
You didn't tell me
it was your birthday!

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:17.074
I'll take you
for a magnificent dinner.

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:18.943
We'll go
to a great restaurant.
Really?

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:23.007
(STUTTERING) Do you enjoy
the McNuggets thing?

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:27.318
What about Indian food?
Do you like spicy food?

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:29.320
No, no, it's okay.

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:31.326
I don't really have
much of an appetite.

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:34.258
But you will when
they bring out the prawns
in hydrochloric acid.

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.025
It's fantastic, Sondra.

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:39.233
What's the matter?

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:41.236
What,
are you thinking of Peter?
No.

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:43.168
I don't know, it's just...

01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:45.707
I wouldn't be surprised
if he asked me to marry him
one day, you know?

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:48.403
You come
from an Orthodox family.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.878
Would they accept
a serial killer?

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:53.342
That's an expensive present.

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:57.851
The Lymans are so wealthy.
Yes.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.683
It was almost
too extravagant.

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:03.252
I'd better get ready.
I still haven't found
my millionaire yet.

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:05.516
(SIGHS)

01:01:06.629 --> 01:01:09.097
Oh, God, Sondra, what a mess!

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.631
It's starting to add up
against him.

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:14.465
Bits and scraps
are coming together.

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:15.936
God, it's you!

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:18.733
I sensed
you were falling in love.
I escaped again.

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:22.470
It's just circumstantial junk,
you know. A coincidence
here and there.

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:24.570
Too much smoke
not to be fire.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.013
Look, I'm sure
you've been wrong
plenty of times.

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:28.243
Not wrong here.

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:31.775
Though I agree
you haven't got enough
to pull the trigger yet.

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:34.184
If you act prematurely,
not only does he walk,

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:37.351
your professional credibility
is wrecked,
sometimes for good.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:39.361
Oh, I'm sure you want him
to be guilty.

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:41.487
You know, that way you get
your last big scoop.

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:42.996
I'm beginning to fade.

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:44.897
Sondra, don't let me down!

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:47.060
I wish you'd fade for good!

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:48.396
Get out of my life!

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:49.904
I'm not
cut out for this.

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:52.497
I should be
flossing molars for a living.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:56.239
The bread is... You know,
I can make a meal
just with the bread.

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:58.212
I can do a whole meal,
just nothing but bread.

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:01.247
If I ate that much bread,
I'd be 20 pounds heavier.

01:02:01.317 --> 01:02:03.182
See,
I never gain an ounce,

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:07.382
because, you know,
my anxiety acts like aerobics.

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:09.056
So I get the exercise.

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:12.588
Thanks for taking me out
for my birthday, Sidney.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:15.186
Well, you know,
you're the daughter
that I never had.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:17.255
Oh, that's so...
No, no, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:18.732
'Cause I never wanted
to have kids.

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:21.433
I didn't.
Because you have kids,
what is it?

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:24.536
You know, you're nice
to them, you bring
them up, you suffer,

01:02:24.607 --> 01:02:26.097
you take care of them

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:30.612
and then they grow up
and they accuse you
of having Alzheimer's.

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:32.739
Could you
ever live in London?

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:35.784
Could I live
in London? No.

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:38.047
And I love London.
Don't get me wrong,
I love London,

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:40.316
but, you know,

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:44.354
apart from
the language problem,
I can't take the driving.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:47.487
Because it, you know,
it's on the wrong side,
and I...

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:49.727
Every time
I drive a car here,

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:52.063
I'm convinced
I'm going to die in a crash.

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:54.391
Sidney!

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:55.559
What's the matter?

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:57.502
It's Peter.

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:58.631
You said
Peter was out of town.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:00.539
Well, that's
what he told me.

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.099
Come on.

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:03.540
What do you mean, come on?

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.774
(STUTTERING)
I ordered prawns.

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:08.075
Just pay, all right?
Just pay.

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:10.444
What do you mean, pay?
All I do is...

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.613
Fine, it's her birthday.

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:16.950
Come on.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.487
Maybe he's got
another woman on the side,

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:22.564
and he likes you,
but he's sexually
attracted to her.

01:03:22.865 --> 01:03:24.025
Thanks, Sidney.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.727
Well, why doesn't he have
his chauffeur?

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.770
I don't know,
whatever he's doing,
he must want it to be secret.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.072
Oh, I told you
he went the other way!

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:09.135
Can we go home, please?

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:10.975
It's starting to rain.

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:13.447
(GROANS) I can't believe
he lied to me.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:17.346
Maybe he's doing
something that he's ashamed
to tell you about.

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:21.288
Maybe he belongs to
one of those clubs, or he's
a cross-dresser or something.

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:23.518
Or maybe
he does folk dancing.

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:26.060
Oh, I'm sure
it's probably something
that when he tells me,

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:28.153
I'll just feel foolish
for thinking he lied.

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:31.462
I'm sure. You know,
not everything in
this world is sinister.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:33.297
You know,
just practically everything.

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:36.202
(GROANS) That Indian food
made me sick.

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:39.764
You hardly touched
your cobra salad.
How can you be sick?

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:41.805
WOMAN: (SCREAMING) Help!

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:44.540
A woman's been strangled!

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:49.450
Help!
A woman's been strangled!
Help, call the police!

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.509
MAN: Somebody call the police!
There's been a murder!

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:52.884
WOMAN 2: There's been
a murder upstairs.

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:53.944
WOMAN 1: Help!

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:56.047
MAN: Have you got a phone?
Have you got a phone?
Call the police.

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:58.923
Could it be the Tarot Killer?
They found a Tarot card.
It's him.

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:00.394
I can't believe it!
She lives in this building.

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.624
It's him again.
They found the Tarot card.

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:07.100
Elizabeth Gibson,
another short-haired brunette.

01:05:07.336 --> 01:05:09.896
(SIGHS) We should have
gone to the police earlier.

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:13.032
Well, you know...
You said that they
wouldn't believe us

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:15.304
and they may not.

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:19.136
Sidney, it's about time
we show my story to
a real newspaperman.

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:21.614
By real, you mean what?

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:22.876
One that's living.

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:26.083
Vivian's father has a friend
that works at <i>The Observer.</i>

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.055
Well, it's very vivid
and rather shocking,

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:32.959
and there are some
genuine circumstantial
bits of evidence.

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:36.760
But let me give you a lesson
in professional journalism.

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:41.562
No newspaper should
or would ever run this story.

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:43.795
What? Why?

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.568
It would be
fatally irresponsible
and libelous.

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:51.179
All you have here
are a number
of titillating speculations.

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:55.745
Flamboyant theories that
tarnish a man, and a
well-known figure at that,

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:58.378
without a single shred
of substantial proof.

01:05:59.522 --> 01:06:01.683
So his mother
was a short-haired brunette.

01:06:01.824 --> 01:06:03.655
So he came late
for a poker game

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:07.287
and said he was going away
on a business trip
and he got caught lying.

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:12.363
Yes, but who keeps
a Tarot deck under
a French horn?

01:06:13.169 --> 01:06:17.196
It's not against the law
to own a Tarot deck,
or keep it wherever you like.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:20.939
You'd look
pretty foolish in court
with your accusations,

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:22.637
and that's
where you'll wind up.

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:26.004
Because he'd have no choice
but to sue you
and the newspaper,

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:27.208
and he'd win.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.015
And to go to the police?

01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:31.046
I'll come to that.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.283
But first let me
continue my tedious
professorial lecture.

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:38.185
Vivian's dad and I
go way back.

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:40.687
He said you were
a journalism student.

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:42.453
Hmm.

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:45.091
You talk about getting a tip.

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:47.132
Okay, you won't
disclose your source,

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:50.331
but what you have done
is let your imagination
run wild.

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:51.531
No, no.

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:55.168
What if I told you
that my source happened
to be a certain Joe Strombel?

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:57.711
The late Joe Strombel?
Yep.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.214
You mean, before he died
he gave a student reporter

01:07:00.282 --> 01:07:02.614
a major story
and didn't follow
it up himself?

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:05.381
We didn't say
it was before he died.

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:07.887
What?
No, it...

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:09.515
He got the story
before he died,

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:12.026
and then he died
before he could follow it up.

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:17.028
(CHUCKLES) Well,
why did he give it to you?
He didn't know he was dying.

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:18.493
I don't buy it.

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.125
I knew Joe Strombel well.

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:22.801
If he'd had a tip
that he considered reliable,

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:25.464
he would certainly
have pursued it himself,

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:27.441
from the grave,
if necessary.

01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:31.442
What about how Peter
was in the neighborhood

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:33.539
the night
the murder was committed?

01:07:33.649 --> 01:07:34.638
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:37.116
I realize as a student
how exciting it must have been

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:39.814
to think that you were onto
something so spectacular.

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:41.422
Hey, she is onto something!

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.549
This kid is a bloodhound.
Look at her!

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:47.153
She could sell the story
to any tabloid in town.

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:48.786
Hmm.

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.860
Now that I've preached
on the realities
of accurate reporting,

01:07:52.935 --> 01:07:56.962
I want to tell you
how catastrophic
for everybody involved

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:59.166
it would have been
if you had, say, taken

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:02.369
the results
of your investigation
to a tabloid.

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:07.273
Today, the police
have apprehended
the Tarot Card Serial Killer.

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:10.647
And it most assuredly
is not Peter Lyman.

01:08:11.153 --> 01:08:12.381
What?

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:15.549
Every paper in town
is going to press
with it as we speak.

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:20.156
It was a handyman
named Henry Banks
who has confessed.

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:24.026
Banks is a delusional paranoid
who's given Scotland Yard

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.761
information
that only the killer
could possibly know.

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:29.399
He's led the police
to two additional bodies

01:08:29.471 --> 01:08:33.305
and his DNA
and a fingerprint
they found check out.

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:36.640
I know
this puts a crimp
in your scoop,

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:40.243
but Henry Banks is
the Tarot Card Serial Killer.

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:42.640
Not Lord Lyman's son.

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:47.151
Well, I can't say
I'm not walking on air.

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:51.254
Oh, Jesus, If I ever catch
that Joe Strombel,
I'll kill him.

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:53.318
I only hope
Peter forgives me
for what I've done.

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:54.487
For what?

01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:56.497
I lied to him.
I'm not Jade Spence.

01:08:56.564 --> 01:09:00.001
I'm a pushy,
duplicitous, ambitious
college student.

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:01.058
I lied to him,
over and over.

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:03.502
Darling, he lied to you, too,
so it's even.

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:06.973
His lies pale in comparison
to the enormity
of what I've done.

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:10.536
So marry him
as Jade Spence.
Don't tell him.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:13.946
(STUTTERING) You know,
you don't have to be
Sondra Pransky ever again.

01:09:14.015 --> 01:09:15.448
Marry him as Jade Spence.

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:18.544
Yeah, but I don't want to
have to get you a
Father's Day gift every year.

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:23.518
You know, I don't know how to
break this to you, honey,
but you were adopted. Okay?

01:09:23.591 --> 01:09:25.526
Your mother and I,
we were at the orphanage,

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:27.892
we wanted
a handicapped child, and...

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:31.292
Ah, finally.
Just you and I all weekend.

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:32.421
Yeah.

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:35.894
I thought you'd like it here.

01:09:36.104 --> 01:09:37.435
It's lovely.
Mmm-hmm.

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:41.703
Peter?
Yes.

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:44.301
I have
a confession to make.
Oh, God, so do I.

01:09:44.813 --> 01:09:46.804
Oh, well, let me go first.

01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:48.782
Actually, no,
let me, please,

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:50.148
because mine's
been bothering me all day.

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:51.582
I just want
to get it off my chest.

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:55.420
When I told you I was
going away for a few days
on business,

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:57.890
I was lying.

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:00.718
I know.
You know? How?

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:03.456
Oh, I saw you.
You saw me? No.

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:06.199
I was at dinner, and...
With your father?

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:09.832
Actually...
Well, anyway,
it doesn't matter. Really.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:14.108
The truth is,
that a company my father owns

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:15.837
is about to merge
with a company
in the Middle East.

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:17.879
It's a very
sensitive situation,

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:19.642
and the less
anyone knows about it,
the better.

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.307
And we just didn't want
the press to sniff it out.

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:22.577
I mean,
that's no excuse, really.

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:24.983
I'm just very sorry
for the extreme secrecy.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:28.114
No, no, no, it's fine.
I'm glad.

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:31.921
It's your own
secret information.
That's fine.

01:10:31.994 --> 01:10:34.258
So your father took you out
for a birthday dinner

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:36.025
and you saw me.
I mean, how unnerving.

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:38.931
God, I mean, the thing
I hate most in the world
is lying.

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.195
Uh-huh.

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:42.895
What?

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:45.972
Peter...
Yes, Jade?

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:48.532
Peter...

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:50.704
Oh, yes.
What did you want to tell me?

01:10:50.846 --> 01:10:51.870
Uh...

01:10:51.947 --> 01:10:53.710
Jade, there's nothing
you can tell me that...

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:56.080
My name is not Jade Spence.

01:10:57.119 --> 01:10:58.450
It's not?

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:01.481
No. It's Sondra Pransky.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:05.720
And my father
is not my father.
His name is Sidney Waterman.

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:07.694
He's a magician
called Splendini.

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:09.287
I'm a journalism student.

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:14.063
Don't ask me
what kind of crazy
misinformation we received

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:16.070
to believe you might be
the Tarot Card Killer.

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:20.302
(STUTTERING) I mean,
I didn't know you
at this time. Remember?

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:23.609
And, of course,
as soon as I got to know you,

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:26.011
I knew that
it couldn't possibly be true.

01:11:26.081 --> 01:11:28.208
And the police have him now,
so everything's fine.

01:11:28.717 --> 01:11:31.117
Of course,
along the route
I fell for you,

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:33.814
and now
I totally blew it, and...

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:35.288
Who told you this?

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:38.952
Oh, a newspaperman.
He's now deceased.

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:41.758
Very foolish.
He was eager
for his last scoop.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:44.489
Oh, I'm so sorry. I just

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:48.192
totally understand
if you never want to
speak to me again

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.135
or if you
don't want to see me...
Miss Pransky.

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:53.298
Not only am I
not angry with you, but you...

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:57.607
(LAUGHS) You've
absolutely made my day!
What?

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.046
Just suspecting
that I could be such
an imaginative,

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:01.742
dramatic fiend.
I love it.

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:02.841
You do?
Yes.

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:05.580
I think it's one of the
funniest, craziest things
I've ever heard in my life.

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:07.087
I can't wait
to tell the chaps
at the club.

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:08.983
(CHUCKLING)
Peter?

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:10.150
Yes, darling.

01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:13.859
I have to ask you something.
Yes, anything. Absolutely.

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:18.759
Why did you hide
that Tarot deck
in your music room?

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:24.302
How do you
know about that?

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:27.907
I was so paranoid. I...
It's crazy.

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:31.070
But I snuck in.
Oh, dear, it was going to be
a surprise.

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:33.614
I bought them for you.
They're Victorian Tarot cards.

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:35.650
You told me
you were into
that kind of thing.

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:36.776
What? Oh...
It was gonna be
a gift for you.

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:39.184
Oh, you're so...
I feel like such an idiot!

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:41.654
Darling, no, no, no,
never mind, never mind.
What a shame.

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:43.453
Let's forget about it.
No...

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:45.123
Huh? Let's just...

01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:49.025
Now that we've confessed
our sins, let's move on
with our lives, huh?

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:51.498
Really?
Yeah. I want to hear
all about the real you.

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:54.162
And I assure you in advance,
I'll love it.

01:12:54.837 --> 01:12:56.031
(MOANING) Oh, God,

01:12:56.105 --> 01:12:59.199
you snuck into
my music room, did you?

01:13:01.076 --> 01:13:02.907
So the reason
why he was skulking around,

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:04.843
was 'cause he had
this private family business

01:13:04.913 --> 01:13:07.245
which is too delicate
to discuss, actually.

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:08.781
Sorry, I don't buy it.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:11.952
What?
The man
is a liar and a murderer.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.681
And I say that
with all due respect.

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:16.020
Sidney.
Child, I know
what I'm talking about.

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:17.319
Don't call me that, all right?

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.384
Do you remember
when we were out
on the estate,

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:21.553
I found a clue,
you thought I was nuts?

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:24.531
I thought you were nuts
so many times I can't
recall the exact one.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.728
Do you remember this?
Do you remember this
little item? This clue?

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:30.268
Yes, Betty G.
Yes, Betty G.

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:34.035
Now, I checked
all the girls
that were murdered.

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:37.574
The one that was killed
the night we saw Peter
on the street, was named

01:13:37.646 --> 01:13:40.114
(CLEARS THROAT)
Elizabeth Gibson.

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:41.907
So?

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:45.248
So Betty
is short for Elizabeth
a lot of times.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.380
Oh, come on, Sidney.
That's a real stretch.
You're reaching now.

01:13:48.457 --> 01:13:52.587
Look, supposing you wanted
to rub somebody out
and not get caught.

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:54.959
Nobody wants
to get caught, Sidney.

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:56.019
Look,

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:59.932
he wants to get rid of
Elizabeth Gibson.
Betty Gibson. Betty Gibson.

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:02.163
So, there's
a series of murders

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:05.638
with a guy that's got
a real style. A Tarot card.

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:07.334
They said
he was a total maniac.

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:10.503
He buys a Tarot deck
and let's say he hides it.

01:14:10.579 --> 01:14:13.446
Hypothetically,
he hides it, let's say,
in a music room.

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:15.813
Let's say he hides it in,
let's say, a French horn.
Oh, Sidney.

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:18.682
In a French horn!
I'm losing patience with you.

01:14:18.754 --> 01:14:20.915
I'm not saying the guy
did all the murders.

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:23.617
I'm saying that he just did
Elizabeth Gibson,

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:27.788
then folded it into the series
of the Tarot Killer
so he wouldn't get caught.

01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:30.161
Henry Banks
confessed to all the murders.

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:32.564
Henry Banks is deranged!
He hallucinates!

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:33.623
My God.

01:14:33.769 --> 01:14:36.704
Henry... And you know
those guys like to brag
when they get caught.

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:38.863
Henry Banks, you know...

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:43.571
Where are you going? The cops
will dump every unsolved
murder on Henry Banks.

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:45.545
They haven't
caught anybody in years.

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:48.512
Peter wouldn't hurt a fly.
Oh, really?

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:50.381
What about a fly who speaks?

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:52.446
What?
Yes.

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:54.614
Why would Peter
kill a prostitute?

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:57.118
Because it looks terrible
on his resume.

01:14:57.192 --> 01:14:59.820
Who knows what kind of
sordid life this guy has?

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:02.420
Have you
completely lost your mind?
What is wrong with you?

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:05.626
Peter being
blackmailed by a prostitute?
It's ridiculous.

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:07.293
What are you putting
in your Metamucil?

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:09.367

Where are you going?

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:12.669
You don't understand!
It would kill his reputation!

the water out?

Can I just tell you one thing?

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.446
Joe Strombel
would not agree with you.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:23.917
I don't want to talk about
Joe Strombel, all right?

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:25.851
Even a great reporter
can be wrong.

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:27.751
But he's not wrong.

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:29.347

I see it all over.

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:31.016

who always sees the glass
half-empty!

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:35.955
No, you're wrong.
I see the glass half-full,
but of poison.

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:37.328
And you're gonna wind up
drinking it!

01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:40.163
You don't know anything.
You don't have a reporter's
instincts, okay?

01:15:40.235 --> 01:15:42.601
You're some guy
who vanishes silk
handkerchiefs

01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:44.161
and cuts
people's neckties off.

Go back to your card tricks,
all right?

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:55.244
Did you tell her?

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:57.048
I did. I told her.

01:15:57.119 --> 01:16:00.520
And I made it seem
as though it all suddenly
just came to me.

01:16:00.589 --> 01:16:01.715
I know I'm right.

01:16:02.157 --> 01:16:04.057
She just won't listen to me.
She hates me.

01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:05.320
Yeah. I...
You know,

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:07.988
sometimes, I got to say,
I worry about that girl.

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:11.556
I don't think
I'll be seeing you anymore.

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:15.493
Well, if there's a scoop
to be had here,

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:17.104
she's going
to get it for you.

01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:19.803
You can only cheat death
so many times,

01:16:20.275 --> 01:16:22.140
and I've used
every trick I know.

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:24.837

that she deserved to die.

She was very sexy.

You know.
Not that you'd know
that from those pictures.

01:18:42.317 --> 01:18:45.184

Oh, no, I know, I know.

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:53.251
She made the mistake
of cutting it off
and dyeing it black.

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:54.860
God knows why.

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:57.723
Maybe it's to please
one of her regulars.

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:00.728

are spending the weekend
at my father's country house.

01:19:41.176 --> 01:19:42.370
You could have come.

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:47.371
That's okay. She gave me
this number to call.
May I speak with her?

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:48.541
Yes, one second.

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:57.384
Hi, Sidney.

Listen,
I got a treasure trove
of information here.

01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:03.993

She's called Betty.

And she had some kind of
a long relationship...

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:16.904
A special relationship
with some young guy, Peter.

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:21.415
The last name
doesn't click,
but I'm sure it's the same.

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:23.379
This is crazy.

Look, stop making trouble,
Sidney. The case is closed.

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:30.455
Listen, this thing adds up.

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:35.125
You're alone up there with
a very, very dangerous man.

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:36.855
That's two verys.

You got to get back to town
right away.

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.962
Sidney, if I thought there was
a shred of proof,

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:45.268
I would never let
my personal feelings
get involved, all right?

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:46.898
The truth is,
I'm crazy about the guy.

01:20:46.975 --> 01:20:50.672
I can't keep obsessing
over tantalizing
conspiracy theories.

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:59.385
You know, I'm sure
that he killed her

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:02.446
and made it look
like a Tarot killing.

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:06.420
You know,
you don't see it because
you got stars in your eyes.

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:10.028
Look, I don't...
This is crazy! I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:11.759
It's too upsetting for me,
all right?

01:21:11.833 --> 01:21:13.130
Let me have my nice weekend.

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:14.429
I'll talk to you
when I get back.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.697
Stop putting
these paranoid thoughts
in my head!

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.635
Is Sidney okay?
Yes, yes.

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:23.371
You know, I love Sidney,
I really do,

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:25.936
but he's just...
He's got a part missing,
you know, he's crazy!

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:27.276
Yes, really?
Mmm-hmm.

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:28.373
Like what?

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:30.110
We'll talk about it later.

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:31.709
Let me change, okay?
Mmm-Hmm.

01:21:52.507 --> 01:21:54.407
Yes? Oh, yes, sir.

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:59.004
Yes. My daughter
is in the country
with Mr. Lyman.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.208
And I'm gonna
be driving up there later
and she asked me

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:05.515
if I could pick up her red
cashmere sweater. She thinks
she left it upstairs.

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:06.679
Red cashmere?

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:09.383
Yes, it's a red sweater.
It's a kind of a red,
tomato red,

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:11.516
like a fire engine.
A red. A <i>rouge.</i>

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:14.391
I understand, sir. Red.
Yes, yes.

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:16.293
I'll see if I can find it.

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:22.060
Sir?

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:25.257
(STUTTERING) Oh, I was just
checking out the Stradivarius.

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:31.668
I play a few pieces myself
on the violin. Prokofiev
and Bartok, the <i>Hot Canary...</i>

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:35.039
But Mr. Lyman is the
only person to have the
combination to that room.

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:38.045
Yes, but he wanted
to share it with me
because, you know,

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:39.580
in case something happened,

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:41.581
you know,
life is very capricious.

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:45.244
A stroke, a sudden embolism
or lightning...
You know I...

01:23:45.587 --> 01:23:47.612
Darling, I love you.
I mean that sincerely.

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:50.988
You're a wonderful woman,
you're a tremendous servant
and a credit to your race.

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:53.254
And I mean that. From
the bottom of my heart
I say that to you.

01:23:53.328 --> 01:23:54.852
I notice you didn't
get the red sweater.

01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:56.590
She probably left it
in another bedroom.

01:23:56.664 --> 01:23:58.859
You know,
she's got a little problem
with promiscuity.

01:23:58.933 --> 01:24:00.093
But...

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:03.532
So, I'll be going.
I'll call you.
We'll have lunch.

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:16.182
Mr. Lyman, sir, Mr. Spence
has been here and he's
been into the music room.

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:18.248
What do you mean?

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.511
A most unusual
sequence of events.

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:22.852
Mr. Spence came by
looking for his
daughter's sweater.

01:24:22.924 --> 01:24:24.414
Said she'd requested it.

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:26.722
Next thing I knew,
he was in the music room.

01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:29.719
Sir, I think
he'd been drinking,
from his behavior.

01:24:30.665 --> 01:24:32.963
Yes, yes.

01:24:33.568 --> 01:24:36.162
Yes. Okay, Margaret,
thank you. Goodbye.

01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:38.465
Is everything okay?

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:41.407
Yes.
Yes, it will be.

01:25:56.584 --> 01:25:59.576
It's so nice
to be out here with you,
just away

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:03.022
from the rest of the world
and...
Hmm.

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:07.585
Yes, I often
come out here to read and,
well, and fish.

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:09.152
There's trout in the lake.

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:19.596
What are you thinking about?

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:22.367
You really want to know?
Yes.

01:26:24.879 --> 01:26:27.541
Just how ironic life is,
and tragic.

01:26:28.082 --> 01:26:29.344
Why?

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:32.512
Well, that I met you
by rescuing you from drowning

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:35.152
and found you
totally enchanting

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:39.749
and now we've come full cycle
and, alas, you're going
to have to drown.

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:43.889
What?

01:26:44.332 --> 01:26:47.426
Oh, I imagine by now
Sidney's confirmed
that I killed Betty Gibson.

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:50.096
I mean, in my own defense,
there really was
no other way out.

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:53.437
At first I managed
to hide my identity from her,

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:55.669
but I saw her too many times
over the years

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:58.708
and she learned who I was,
and...

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:01.408
Well, it became
a constant demand for money

01:27:01.482 --> 01:27:03.712
and I just
could not let that go on,
could I?

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:06.743
I mean, my whole life
and career

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:09.654
would be
just hostage to her
moods at all times.

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:14.123
So, I studied
the Tarot case,

01:27:14.195 --> 01:27:16.527
I rehearsed my plan,
and, well, you know the rest.

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:18.531
If you do something to me,
Sidney's gonna find out!

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:19.726
He'll tell someone.

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:22.361
No, no, no.
You see, you will go
in a boating accident,

01:27:22.437 --> 01:27:24.132
and Sidney will go
later tonight.

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:26.733
No one knows
of your relationship with him,

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:29.700
because, after all,
you're not actually father
and daughter, are you?

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:33.505
And no one will think twice
to investigate the death
of some obscure vaud...

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:34.809
Are you listening?

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:36.981
No one will think twice
to investigate the death

01:27:37.051 --> 01:27:40.612
of some obscure vaudevillian
called Splendini, who is
really a stranger to me.

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:42.380
Help!

01:27:42.457 --> 01:27:44.220
Help! Someone help me!

01:27:51.165 --> 01:27:52.826
(CHUCKLES)

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:54.759
Yes, very quiet, isn't it?

01:27:58.072 --> 01:28:00.097
This is the advantage
of a private lake.

01:28:04.212 --> 01:28:06.180
Get off me!
Get off me!

01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:07.236
(GRUNTS)

01:28:08.082 --> 01:28:09.242
Get off me!
Come...

01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:40.140
(TIRES SCREECHING)

01:28:40.214 --> 01:28:41.203
(CRASHING)

01:28:41.282 --> 01:28:42.408
(GLASS SHATTERING)

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.649
(PANTING)

01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:30.223
(FEIGNING CRYING)
Yes, police.

01:29:31.899 --> 01:29:35.300
Yes, this is Peter Lyman.
I need the police immediately.

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:37.861
At the Lyman estate.

01:29:38.373 --> 01:29:41.968
There's been
a terrible boating accident.
A woman has drowned.

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:43.738
It's awful.
Please come right away.

01:29:43.811 --> 01:29:45.301
Thank you. Thank you.

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:50.014
(SIGHS)

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:53.915
They think they know
where the body is.

01:29:55.123 --> 01:29:56.590
I'm so sorry, sir.

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:01.490
When last I saw her,
she...

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:07.724
She just said she wanted
to go out there to
communicate with nature.

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:11.204
Just to think
she wanted some
peace and quiet and...

01:30:11.639 --> 01:30:13.664
She wasn't depressed,
or anything like that,
was she, sir?

01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:14.730
God, no. No.

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:17.271
I mean, unless she was
keeping it from me.

01:30:17.545 --> 01:30:19.206
You heard no cries for help?

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.738
No! No,
I was listening to music
in here, damn it.

01:30:23.451 --> 01:30:25.043
(SIGHS) It's just so ironic.

01:30:25.119 --> 01:30:26.245
Because the way
I first met her

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:28.550
I rescued her
from drowning
in our club pool.

01:30:28.623 --> 01:30:31.114
And she was a very,
very weak swimmer.

01:30:31.859 --> 01:30:33.019
SONDRA: Hello?

01:30:34.295 --> 01:30:36.786
I was faking it at the pool
to get your attention.

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:40.225
Actually, I used to be
captain of the Brooklyn
Community Swim Team.

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:56.674
Fascinating observation.

01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:59.445
Lyman lost a cufflink
at the flat of a prostitute,

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.988
who was later killed
by the Tarot Card Killer.

01:31:03.157 --> 01:31:06.684
Well, this upright chap
certainly enjoyed patronizing
some dodgy women.

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:10.722
Unfortunately
for Elizabeth Gibson,
she elected to blackmail him.

01:31:12.099 --> 01:31:14.124
It's a beautifully
written story

01:31:14.268 --> 01:31:18.136
and one of the best bits
of investigative journalism
in a long time.

01:31:18.506 --> 01:31:20.474
And this paper
is proud to run it.

01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:22.941
Oh, I have to
share the credit
with Joe Strombel.

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:24.268
An inspiration,

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:26.711
who taught me more
than I could ever
explain to anyone.

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:29.545
And to the late
Sidney Waterman.

01:31:30.284 --> 01:31:31.410
Splendini.

01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:34.282
A nice guy who helped out
with the investigation

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:36.983
and without whom
I never could have made it.

01:31:38.392 --> 01:31:40.883
Sidney, wherever you are,

01:31:42.029 --> 01:31:43.462
I'll never forget you.

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:46.697
WOMAN: How did you get here?

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:48.159
Me?

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:51.966
I couldn't get used to driving
on the goddamn wrong
side of the street!

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:54.030
(STUTTERING) You know,
I was driving up
to the country,

01:31:54.108 --> 01:31:57.043
and in the United States,
I would have been a hero.
I would have saved her.

01:31:57.111 --> 01:31:58.100
I would have...

01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:00.704
But here, you know...
That's the one drawback
of living in London.

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:03.909
Granted, the theater's better,
there's many good
Indian restaurants.

01:32:03.985 --> 01:32:05.179
Well, what did you do?

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:07.846
What do I do?
I'm Splendini. Magician.

01:32:07.955 --> 01:32:08.944
(EXCLAIMS)

01:32:09.056 --> 01:32:11.024
Would you like
to see something?
Oh, yes, please.

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:12.753
Do we have time
for a card trick?
Yes.

01:32:12.827 --> 01:32:14.522
I believe we have eternity.

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:16.961
I'm going to show you
a little trick now.

01:32:17.431 --> 01:32:20.195
I just want to say
from the bottom of my heart,
I mean this sincerely...

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:22.233
I say this
with all due respect.

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:24.965
You are a wonderful group and
a fantastic group of people.

01:32:25.039 --> 01:32:27.701
I love you and I feel that
coming back from you.

01:32:27.775 --> 01:32:32.109
And you may be deceased,
but you should not
be discouraged.

01:32:32.179 --> 01:32:33.510
Because, you know...

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:36.141
Don't think of being dead
as a handicap.

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:38.344
You know,
when I was a child,
I stuttered.

01:32:38.419 --> 01:32:40.819
But with stick-to-it-iveness
and perseverance,

01:32:40.888 --> 01:32:42.856
you know, you can never tell
what could happen.

01:32:42.924 --> 01:32:44.357
Now, I want you
to take a card, Alma.

01:32:44.425 --> 01:32:45.687
Go ahead,
take any card you want.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.455
Just pick it. Pick it.
Go ahead, sweetheart.

01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:49.257
<i>I love you, sweetheart.</i>
<i>That's fantastic.</i>
