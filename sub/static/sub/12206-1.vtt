01:58.375 --> 01:59.455
Bye, Roy!

01:59.458 --> 02:00.538
Bye!

02:17.333 --> 02:18.333
Tell me!

02:18.375 --> 02:19.455
Got it!

02:19.458 --> 02:20.493
Registered in 2009

02:20.500 --> 02:22.456
mszaw Ares anlestatekli205

02:22.458 --> 02:23.458
25 years old.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.455
Phone number

02:24.458 --> 02:26.414
95030990

02:29.250 --> 02:30.410
she's 4 months pregnant.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.411
You want someone else?

02:33.417 --> 02:35.373
Will that affect the organs?

02:39.250 --> 02:40.410
Then what's the problem?

02:43.333 --> 02:44.413
Do it.

02:56.292 --> 02:59.409
An average of 620 people go missing
a year in Hong Kong,

03:01.292 --> 03:02.407
without any omens.

03:02.458 --> 03:07.373
They go to work and go to school as usual.

03:08.375 --> 03:10.411
Then they disappear without a trace.

03:12.250 --> 03:13.330
Are you alright?

03:13.333 --> 03:14.368
I feel dizzy.

03:20.417 --> 03:21.406
We found these bodies

03:21.417 --> 03:23.453
in the south China sea in 2006.

03:23.542 --> 03:26.500
Their chests and abdomens
have been cut open.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.367
Their hearts and livers have been removed.

03:30.417 --> 03:32.373
They are later verified

03:32.417 --> 03:34.408
as missing persons in Hong Kong.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.286
Does the boss know she's pregnant?

03:42.375 --> 03:43.490
We believe

03:43.500 --> 03:48.290
this organ trafficking cartel
has been running for 7 years.

03:50.250 --> 03:51.365
As usual.

03:52.417 --> 03:53.497
Saline on the left,

03:53.500 --> 03:55.331
drug pouch on the right.

03:55.458 --> 03:56.493
Keep a close watch.

04:08.250 --> 04:09.456
Don't worry.

04:09.542 --> 04:13.239
The containers will reach
Thailand in 2 days.

04:14.333 --> 04:17.450
I planted a mole inside
a possible smuggling cartel.

04:18.250 --> 04:22.243
I'm confident we can lock the target soon.

04:38.458 --> 04:40.244
Warden!

05:05.542 --> 05:07.498
Examine the girl carefully.

05:08.292 --> 05:10.374
The client will be here
in 2 days for surgery.

05:22.417 --> 05:24.373
Human organ

05:31.375 --> 05:33.491
Daddy, you go first. No problem!

05:33.500 --> 05:36.367
Hurry! No problem!

05:42.250 --> 05:44.241
I don't want to play anymore.

05:44.250 --> 05:45.285
Don't be scared!

05:46.500 --> 05:48.491
It's fun! Look!

05:48.542 --> 05:50.533
I don't want to play.

05:52.375 --> 05:54.366
Come on, listen to daddy.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.286
One step at a time.

05:56.292 --> 05:57.281
One step...

05:57.292 --> 05:58.327
One step at a time.

05:58.333 --> 06:00.324
Keep your eyes on the ice.

06:00.458 --> 06:01.458
Don't be scared.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.240
It's easy.

06:03.333 --> 06:04.413
Good job!

06:05.250 --> 06:06.490
Very good!

06:07.292 --> 06:09.453
Look at the ice, you're like a little bird,

06:09.500 --> 06:11.286
soaring in the sky.

06:11.375 --> 06:13.240
Soaring...

06:13.333 --> 06:15.244
Sa, you're going too fast!

06:15.250 --> 06:17.286
Come here, daddy!

06:17.333 --> 06:19.244
Slow down!

06:22.417 --> 06:23.417
Thanks!

06:24.500 --> 06:25.500
Slow down!

06:29.375 --> 06:30.455
Slow down!

06:30.500 --> 06:32.365
Careful, honey!

06:36.458 --> 06:37.458
Sal!

06:38.333 --> 06:39.333
Sal!

06:45.417 --> 06:46.417
Bend down.

06:54.292 --> 06:57.489
Who gave you permission to take her out?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.286
The doctor.

06:59.375 --> 07:02.367
I called him already,
take her upstairs right away!

07:02.500 --> 07:05.242
Can you go faster? Doctor!

07:05.333 --> 07:06.448
Doctor! Doctor!

07:06.500 --> 07:08.331
Hurry! Take her inside!

07:08.375 --> 07:09.375
Rugry, !

07:38.250 --> 07:40.241
We need to draw some blood!

07:41.292 --> 07:43.374
How is she?

07:43.417 --> 07:46.375
Sa, are you alright?
Her condition has stabilized.

07:46.417 --> 07:50.365
But she only has 1/3
of the normal platelet count.

07:50.458 --> 07:52.494
I'll give her a new drug.

07:53.292 --> 07:56.409
We'll see if she'll get better.

07:57.250 --> 08:00.538
Any word on the bone marrow transplant?

08:01.250 --> 08:05.289
We found a match,
but were unable to contact the donor.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.332
If we hear anything,

08:08.417 --> 08:11.250
the hospital will call you.

08:11.375 --> 08:13.411
Can you give me the donor's contact?

08:13.458 --> 08:17.246
I can try to call him.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.539
I'm sorry, I can't.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.411
The donor's details are confidential.

08:22.417 --> 08:24.499
I beg you, doctor!

08:25.500 --> 08:28.242
You must be patient.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.457
Chan chi kit

09:19.375 --> 09:22.287
After every setback

09:22.333 --> 09:24.494
the pain intensifies.

09:24.500 --> 09:28.288
I ask myself...

09:45.458 --> 09:47.244
Sal!

09:54.375 --> 09:55.375
Sal!

10:00.375 --> 10:02.366
I had a dream.

10:02.458 --> 10:04.323
About what?

10:05.292 --> 10:07.374
I can't tell you.

11:11.458 --> 11:12.447
Chai!

11:12.458 --> 11:16.326
Why didn't you tell me
your daughter is sick?

11:16.375 --> 11:19.367
You want to wait till she's dead?

11:19.500 --> 11:21.491
Are we not brothers?

11:22.458 --> 11:24.244
I'm ss orry!

11:24.250 --> 11:27.367
I didn't realize the new
drug is so expensive.

11:28.250 --> 11:29.239
Chai!

11:29.250 --> 11:30.490
Sa is like a daughter to me.

11:31.250 --> 11:34.242
What a shame she's so
sick at such a young age.

11:36.292 --> 11:37.498
Over there!

11:38.375 --> 11:40.286
What's your name?

12:19.375 --> 12:21.331
Move!

12:21.500 --> 12:23.286
Let go!

12:23.333 --> 12:24.448
Go!

12:27.417 --> 12:29.373
What are you doing?

12:32.292 --> 12:34.248
Warden. This is the photo.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.412
You were arrested in 2004
for drug possession.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.493
What?

12:39.500 --> 12:42.287
You were sentenced to life imprisonment.

12:42.333 --> 12:43.333
It wasn't me.

12:43.375 --> 12:45.331
La washstdmen

12:45.375 --> 12:47.286
let go of me!

12:52.333 --> 12:53.539
Let go of me!

12:54.333 --> 12:55.493
Let go!

13:01.333 --> 13:03.289
It is now.

13:03.458 --> 13:04.538
Get his fingerprints.

13:04.542 --> 13:06.248
What do you want?

13:06.417 --> 13:08.282
What do you really want?

13:09.250 --> 13:10.535
You screwed my business partner,

13:11.333 --> 13:12.448
I had to fix you.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.240
Who are you?

14:02.375 --> 14:05.287
What are you looking at?

14:20.500 --> 14:21.500
Go!

14:26.417 --> 14:27.532
I'm a cop.

14:29.458 --> 14:30.538
I am police.

14:31.250 --> 14:32.490
Move! I am Hong Kong police.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.285
I am Hong Kong police.

14:34.375 --> 14:36.240
Anybody help me?

14:36.292 --> 14:37.452
Anybody help me?

14:37.458 --> 14:38.493
I can pay!

14:39.250 --> 14:41.332
Money!

14:41.500 --> 14:43.286
Money...

14:43.292 --> 14:44.532
I am police! Trust me!

14:45.250 --> 14:46.410
Help me! I can give money.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.289
Money...

14:48.375 --> 14:49.410
Money...

14:50.292 --> 14:51.372
Mandarin?

14:51.417 --> 14:53.328
Cantonese?

14:53.417 --> 14:55.248
Move it!

14:55.250 --> 14:57.286
Can anyone speak cantonese?

15:00.333 --> 15:04.451
English?

15:14.417 --> 15:16.282
I can pay!

15:16.375 --> 15:18.457
Anybody help me?

15:23.458 --> 15:26.245
And try to

15:26.500 --> 15:31.369
give up someone I love.

15:31.542 --> 15:35.239
Unfortunately it's a mockery

15:35.500 --> 15:38.458
endless lamenting

15:38.500 --> 15:43.494
and sorrow in a world of indifference

15:44.542 --> 15:47.534
the misfortune in life

15:48.250 --> 15:50.491
will not leave me alone

15:51.250 --> 15:53.457
after every setback

15:53.458 --> 15:56.325
the pain intensifies

16:16.292 --> 16:18.283
You'll get fired if you keep this up.

16:18.375 --> 16:20.366
You would have wasted everyone's time.

16:20.458 --> 16:22.414
Are you stupid or what?

16:23.542 --> 16:25.328
Where are my smokes?

16:31.333 --> 16:32.493
Look at me!

16:34.333 --> 16:36.289
Look at me!

16:39.417 --> 16:41.248
What the fuck?

16:44.250 --> 16:46.241
What're you doing?

16:46.375 --> 16:47.375
No!

16:47.500 --> 16:48.455
No!

16:48.500 --> 16:49.535
No!

16:52.250 --> 16:53.330
No!

17:07.500 --> 17:08.500
Look at you!

17:08.541 --> 17:10.406
You call yourself a cop?

17:13.458 --> 17:16.530
You said I talk like a fucking punk!

17:17.458 --> 17:20.290
Now you want to know
why I don't look like a cop?

17:24.375 --> 17:27.242
This is how I get the scoop.

17:27.333 --> 17:30.291
You think they'd call and tell you?

17:38.292 --> 17:40.374
I'm trying to kick it.

17:42.417 --> 17:44.328
Just keep this under wraps.

18:10.917 --> 18:13.704
Walk as fast as you can.

18:26.750 --> 18:27.956
It's ok, take it easy.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.744
How much time do I have?

18:31.708 --> 18:33.915
Will power is crucial.

18:34.708 --> 18:37.905
There's hope as long as
you're on the list for heart transplant.

18:41.750 --> 18:42.910
My blood type...

18:43.875 --> 18:45.740
Is the rare Bombay phenotype.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.873
Less than...

18:47.958 --> 18:49.823
One in a million.

18:50.708 --> 18:51.743
If anything goes wrong,

18:51.875 --> 18:54.708
we can give you an artificial heart

18:54.833 --> 18:56.698
that can last 5 years.

18:57.958 --> 18:59.914
When will I find a heart?

19:01.708 --> 19:04.871
Your brother's report is out.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.831
He has the same blood type.

19:08.792 --> 19:12.705
Hla 100%.

19:32.750 --> 19:33.910
Next week

19:35.833 --> 19:36.868
we go to Thailand.

19:42.875 --> 19:44.911
I'll get you an electronic heart.

19:46.917 --> 19:49.750
The experts say it can last 5 years.

19:51.833 --> 19:53.949
Yours is a 100% match for me.

19:56.750 --> 19:58.706
I can't have surgery all the time.

20:01.875 --> 20:03.786
You're my brother.

20:03.875 --> 20:05.786
We grew up together.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.740
You love me

20:08.958 --> 20:10.744
and provided for me.

20:10.917 --> 20:12.703
We're brothers!

20:12.917 --> 20:14.703
I know you won't do it.

20:15.833 --> 20:16.993
I trust you won't.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.866
I need your help this afternoon.

20:37.708 --> 20:38.948
We have an order

20:39.708 --> 20:40.914
to kidnap 2 people.

20:40.958 --> 20:42.744
Husband and wife.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.911
Bring me the bag from the reception.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.956
Your singing sucks! Let me do it.

20:56.750 --> 20:57.956
Stop it!

20:59.708 --> 21:00.868
Again!

21:17.708 --> 21:18.743
Bingo!

21:19.000 --> 21:21.707
They want me to kidnap someone right now.

21:21.875 --> 21:22.955
Where?

21:23.708 --> 21:24.708
Don't know yet.

21:25.958 --> 21:27.869
But they have guns.

21:28.708 --> 21:29.788
I'll track your phone.

21:29.833 --> 21:31.033
Stall them until we get there.

21:31.917 --> 21:32.952
Kit!

21:33.708 --> 21:35.699
Run if it goes sour.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.697
We must go now, ok?

21:46.750 --> 21:48.741
Someone will take us onto the boat.

21:49.792 --> 21:51.703
We'll be fine.

22:03.708 --> 22:06.871
I'll kill him if he so
much as touches your hair.

23:15.958 --> 23:17.949
The cruise terminal? The nerve of them!

23:17.958 --> 23:19.789
Go over there!

23:19.792 --> 23:20.827
Nyeshsin!

23:35.958 --> 23:36.993
Zone al

23:40.708 --> 23:41.743
chief!

24:09.833 --> 24:11.698
It's them!

24:11.792 --> 24:12.952
Keep the man alive.

24:12.958 --> 24:14.698
Take him on the boat.

24:14.875 --> 24:15.955
Kill the woman.

24:19.875 --> 24:20.910
Take her out.

24:50.750 --> 24:51.956
They're here! Be careful!

25:05.750 --> 25:06.910
Sit down!

25:19.750 --> 25:20.830
I don't care what...

25:20.875 --> 25:22.740
Arrest them if they make a move.

25:24.792 --> 25:26.828
Attention please...

25:26.875 --> 25:28.740
Shoot!

25:33.833 --> 25:35.869
I said shoot!

25:37.958 --> 25:39.823
Don't worry, get up!

25:40.708 --> 25:41.914
Make sure it doesn't go off!

25:41.917 --> 25:43.703
I can't die!

25:43.792 --> 25:45.783
Didn't we pay you?

25:47.708 --> 25:48.823
Loser!

26:23.750 --> 26:24.910
Run! Hurry!

27:17.708 --> 27:18.823
Get up!

27:21.917 --> 27:22.952
Get up!

27:35.750 --> 27:36.739
Brother wah!

27:36.750 --> 27:40.823
I have the target, come get him.

27:40.833 --> 27:43.700
Fllakelhimktolgatelsalliibeliighitherne!

28:00.708 --> 28:02.915
Run!

28:06.792 --> 28:08.783
Bring the boat around! Hurry!

28:17.792 --> 28:18.827
You're running away?

28:24.792 --> 28:26.748
Police! Freeze! Get down!

28:26.792 --> 28:27.827
Freeze! Help me, officer!

28:27.833 --> 28:28.697
Behindime

28:28.750 --> 28:30.706
stay down! Someone wants to kill me!

28:36.875 --> 28:37.990
Hey!

29:14.792 --> 29:15.827
Run!

29:17.708 --> 29:18.743
Go!

29:28.833 --> 29:29.993
Keep an eye on him!

30:27.833 --> 30:28.976
Suspect gunned down at cruise terminal,

30:29.000 --> 30:30.911
please send an ambulance.

30:30.917 --> 30:31.917
Over!

31:49.958 --> 31:51.789
Sir!

31:52.875 --> 31:54.706
What's the status?

31:54.750 --> 31:55.785
Sir!

31:55.833 --> 31:56.948
He's still in a coma.

31:57.708 --> 31:57.946
His name is hung man bi...

31:57.958 --> 31:59.823
32 years old, no criminal record.

31:59.958 --> 32:02.870
He's an anesthetist at mercy hospital.

32:02.875 --> 32:04.957
Three shots to the chest led
to hemorrhaging in the lungs.

32:04.958 --> 32:07.825
The doctor will operate when
his condition stabilizes.

32:12.917 --> 32:13.952
Excuse me.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.706
My name is hung man Kong.

32:15.792 --> 32:17.312
You asked me to come in to give blood.

32:17.708 --> 32:18.948
Please follow me.

32:18.958 --> 32:19.958
Thanks.

32:20.792 --> 32:21.792
Where is our mole?

32:22.833 --> 32:24.153
On a boat, with the rest of them.

32:24.792 --> 32:26.703
We can still track them down.

32:28.833 --> 32:30.698
We're on the right track.

32:30.792 --> 32:31.781
This guy...

32:31.792 --> 32:33.703
So many people want him dead,

32:33.958 --> 32:35.698
when he wakes up,

32:35.708 --> 32:36.914
we'll know what's going on.

32:37.792 --> 32:39.908
The doctor said you have a weak heart,

32:39.958 --> 32:42.870
we'll start with 250cc.

32:42.958 --> 32:44.789
Thank you.

32:45.750 --> 32:47.741
Let us know if you feel sick.

32:49.917 --> 32:50.781
Sir.

32:50.917 --> 32:52.908
The target's brother is here.

33:06.958 --> 33:08.744
Excuse me,

33:08.833 --> 33:10.915
I'm chan kwok wah,
crime unit of kowloon west.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.741
I'm in charge of your brother's case.

33:13.833 --> 33:15.949
He was the target at
the cruise terminal shootout.

33:17.917 --> 33:19.748
How is he?

33:20.958 --> 33:22.698
He's still in a coma.

33:23.708 --> 33:24.976
He's a suspect in several kidnapping cases.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.911
He's in custody for questioning.

33:28.833 --> 33:29.833
Sir!

33:29.917 --> 33:31.828
Can you tell me

33:31.917 --> 33:33.748
if he can be out on bail?

33:33.792 --> 33:34.907
I want to get him a lawyer.

33:35.833 --> 33:36.993
What do you do?

33:37.875 --> 33:38.990
Toy trading.

33:39.708 --> 33:40.697
You have a business card?

33:40.708 --> 33:41.708
Yes.

33:52.750 --> 33:54.832
How is your relationship with your brother?

33:57.750 --> 33:59.706
He donated blood several times

33:59.833 --> 34:00.913
to save my life.

34:01.750 --> 34:02.830
Before he got married,

34:02.917 --> 34:03.952
we used to live together.

34:04.708 --> 34:05.914
We're very close.

34:21.750 --> 34:22.956
Close?

34:23.875 --> 34:26.708
Your number is not in his phone book.

34:30.792 --> 34:31.952
My phone number is...

34:32.708 --> 34:34.869
08721018

34:34.917 --> 34:37.750
1972/10/18

34:37.833 --> 34:39.744
is my birthday.

34:39.833 --> 34:41.072
The number is easy to remember.

34:41.792 --> 34:42.907
We're brothers,

34:42.958 --> 34:45.699
my number need not be in his phone book.

34:46.708 --> 34:47.868
Nice number.

34:47.958 --> 34:48.993
Yes.

34:49.750 --> 34:51.741
He gave it to me.

34:52.917 --> 34:53.781
Sir!

34:53.792 --> 34:55.748
Phone call for you.

34:55.917 --> 34:57.703
Excuse me.

35:01.667 --> 35:02.747
Open up!

35:03.750 --> 35:04.865
Sir!

35:10.833 --> 35:12.789
I have your boy chan chi kit.

35:12.833 --> 35:15.700
Trade him with hung man biu
if you want him back.

35:15.833 --> 35:17.619
You have two days.

35:17.625 --> 35:19.832
If I don't see him, I'll
chop your boy to pieces.

35:19.875 --> 35:22.708
Who's this? Hello?

35:36.708 --> 35:39.745
You won't save a cop in trouble?

35:39.792 --> 35:40.907
I never said that.

35:41.667 --> 35:43.623
But I can't lose the suspect.

35:43.833 --> 35:45.619
We can't take that chance.

35:45.667 --> 35:48.659
Or our effort for years
will go down the drain!

35:49.792 --> 35:51.632
I didn't want a fellow
cop to get hurt either.

35:51.708 --> 35:53.619
He wasn't just a cop.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.615
He's my nephew.

35:59.667 --> 36:01.874
I am police.

36:01.875 --> 36:04.662
I... am a Hong Kong police.

36:05.667 --> 36:07.703
I am a Hong Kong police.

36:07.792 --> 36:09.703
Who can help me?

36:09.708 --> 36:11.824
I can pay! I can give money!

36:12.667 --> 36:14.703
Kwong came to me a week ago.

36:15.625 --> 36:20.790
You need money because
your daughter is sick.

36:32.792 --> 36:35.625
If you need more,
we'll talk again at month end.

36:37.708 --> 36:40.620
Take good care of your daughter.

37:29.792 --> 37:30.792
Sal!

37:30.833 --> 37:33.791
You know what police means?

37:36.625 --> 37:38.741
Daddy, give me your phone.

37:41.667 --> 37:42.702
Here!

37:42.750 --> 37:44.911
I downloaded an app for you.

37:54.875 --> 37:55.875
"Police"

37:58.750 --> 37:59.865
police.

38:31.708 --> 38:33.699
Donator.

38:35.917 --> 38:38.909
Clash with police

38:38.917 --> 38:40.578
outside beacon heights,

38:40.625 --> 38:41.614
calling for back up.

38:41.625 --> 38:41.909
Relax!

38:42.625 --> 38:44.616
You know him better than that!

38:44.625 --> 38:46.741
Relax! Everything under control.

38:48.875 --> 38:52.663
Where is the boat?

38:52.667 --> 38:53.747
I don't know!

38:53.792 --> 38:54.747
Where is the boat?

38:54.750 --> 38:55.785
You're out of line!

38:56.708 --> 38:58.869
Tell me! Help! Help!

39:09.792 --> 39:10.827
What did I tell you?

39:10.875 --> 39:12.786
No news, we can't sit here and wait.

39:12.792 --> 39:14.783
Tell me what to do!
No, you tell me what to do!

39:14.833 --> 39:18.701
I don't want you to lose your pension.
We can't find the boat or my nephew.

39:18.917 --> 39:21.659
I'd rather lose my job than lose my nephew.

39:33.750 --> 39:35.741
Hello? How are you?

39:35.875 --> 39:38.833
Can you hear me?
Can you save my daughter?

39:38.917 --> 39:39.872
Who's this?

39:39.875 --> 39:41.740
You speak thai?

39:41.750 --> 39:43.741
I don't understand.

39:43.875 --> 39:45.615
Wait a minute.

39:47.833 --> 39:49.619
Please wait.

39:56.875 --> 39:58.661
What do you want?

39:58.792 --> 39:59.702
What the fuck is this?

39:59.750 --> 40:00.660
Hey! What do you want?

40:00.708 --> 40:01.743
Don't move!

40:01.792 --> 40:03.632
Key aw ih atid oye uw ani

40:04.750 --> 40:07.708

Hurry...

40:08.708 --> 40:11.825
Don't play with the phone! I'm hanging up!

40:11.875 --> 40:14.662
Hello? Please hold.

40:14.708 --> 40:15.823
Tell him what?

40:16.875 --> 40:18.740
Only he can save my daughter.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.658
What the fuck are you talking about?

40:26.708 --> 40:27.823
Global translator

40:28.833 --> 40:30.869
my daughter has leukemia.

40:31.792 --> 40:33.828
This guy's bone marrow can save her.

40:34.625 --> 40:35.831
He can save my daughter.

40:35.833 --> 40:39.655
I hope he can come to Thailand.

40:52.833 --> 40:54.789
I beg you, please help my daughter.

40:59.792 --> 41:02.784
Are you the owner of this phone?

41:02.833 --> 41:03.822
Or are you a friend?

41:03.833 --> 41:06.745
Listen to me...

41:07.875 --> 41:09.786
There's a girl who has leukemia.

41:09.833 --> 41:12.791
I'm not the owner of this phone.

41:12.875 --> 41:16.743
I fished it out of the water.

41:16.833 --> 41:19.791
Are you the owner?

41:20.792 --> 41:24.614
There's no sound. Is it broken?

41:24.625 --> 41:25.785
What happened?

41:26.792 --> 41:30.705
Hold on! Don't hang up!

41:30.833 --> 41:32.915
What did he say?

41:36.833 --> 41:38.619
He said...

41:38.792 --> 41:41.659
It's not his phone.

41:41.667 --> 41:42.873
He just found it.

41:57.917 --> 41:59.873
How old is your daughter?

42:09.792 --> 42:11.874
How old is your daughter?

42:31.875 --> 42:33.866
Are you sick? What's wrong with you?

42:33.917 --> 42:35.873
Headache.

42:37.750 --> 42:39.786
In that case, we must operate.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.828
Don't laugh! Take this seriously!

42:43.625 --> 42:45.866
Do I really need surgery?

42:45.917 --> 42:47.703
Yes!

42:48.625 --> 42:50.707
Nurse, please look after her

42:57.792 --> 43:01.740
Daddy! How are you, doctor?

43:05.833 --> 43:07.698
Can you give me a check-up?

43:09.792 --> 43:11.783
My heart is beating very fast.

43:15.750 --> 43:18.617
Your patients are waiting for you.

43:18.833 --> 43:20.824
We're pretending.

43:20.917 --> 43:22.623
Really?

43:23.667 --> 43:25.874
Daddy, I have a secret.

43:26.792 --> 43:27.827
What?

43:28.667 --> 43:32.740
The doctor found someone who can save me.

43:32.833 --> 43:35.620
I copied down his phone number.

43:35.917 --> 43:37.623
Where?

43:42.667 --> 43:45.704
If we find him, I'll get well.

43:45.708 --> 43:49.781
Don't worry, daddy! We'll find him.

43:49.833 --> 43:51.869
Can you promise not to tell anyone?

43:55.625 --> 43:59.868
I promise! I'll zip it up.

44:01.708 --> 44:03.619
I'll get well.

44:03.917 --> 44:05.873
I will.

44:44.833 --> 44:46.744
Your brother's operation went well.

44:47.833 --> 44:49.619
He'll wake up soon.

44:50.875 --> 44:55.790
When he wakes up,
he can tell me who wants him dead.

45:03.667 --> 45:04.827
You have cigarettes?

45:06.625 --> 45:07.660
Here!

45:08.625 --> 45:09.740
Thanks!

45:11.792 --> 45:14.784
Hopefully he can help you with your case.

45:19.833 --> 45:21.698
I hope so too.

45:21.750 --> 45:23.866
The nurse said you have a weak heart.

45:24.750 --> 45:25.865
You should quit smoking.

45:26.625 --> 45:29.662
That can cure my condition but not my life.

45:29.833 --> 45:31.789
The hell with it!

45:31.875 --> 45:33.740
Well said!

45:40.708 --> 45:41.868
When I was 7 years old,

45:43.667 --> 45:45.658
the doctor said I won't live to 10.

45:46.917 --> 45:48.782
When I was 10,

45:49.833 --> 45:51.824
he said I won't get past 15.

45:53.625 --> 45:54.865
I'm 43 years old now.

45:56.667 --> 45:59.704
Many doctors said it's a miracle.

46:00.792 --> 46:02.783
My pacemaker...

46:02.792 --> 46:04.703
Used to run on 2 batteries.

46:04.792 --> 46:06.828
Now they use a chip.

46:08.708 --> 46:09.868
If it stops,

46:10.625 --> 46:11.785
I die instantly.

46:13.625 --> 46:14.740
For over a decade,

46:15.750 --> 46:17.832
I've been waiting for a heart.

46:19.792 --> 46:21.874
You have a very rare blood type.

46:23.708 --> 46:25.699
Not even one in 10 million.

46:25.792 --> 46:27.703
Does your brother know about this?

46:28.708 --> 46:29.788
Yes!

46:36.833 --> 46:38.664
In this whole world,

46:38.875 --> 46:41.742
only your brother's heart can save you.

46:47.875 --> 46:49.615
Go upstairs with me.

46:49.667 --> 46:51.623
I got a clip today,

46:51.667 --> 46:53.623
I don't know if it's real.

46:53.625 --> 46:55.866
I'm scared after watching it.

47:18.625 --> 47:19.785
My life...

47:19.875 --> 47:21.706
Is bound to his.

47:21.875 --> 47:23.615
If I die,

47:23.708 --> 47:25.699
you'll never see him again.

47:32.750 --> 47:34.741
My heart will stop if I
don't get a new one.

47:34.750 --> 47:36.741
Bust my brother out of the hospital.

47:37.792 --> 47:39.703
Your boss is on his way.

47:40.833 --> 47:42.824
Time is running out.

47:43.875 --> 47:45.786
What a selfless cop!

47:54.000 --> 47:55.206
Ok...

47:56.042 --> 47:58.033
Take it easy!

48:01.125 --> 48:02.990
Where? Corridor.

48:08.000 --> 48:08.238
What?

48:09.000 --> 48:10.226
Bring the car to the back door.

48:10.250 --> 48:11.990
Clean out the trunk.

48:12.000 --> 48:12.204
Why?

48:12.250 --> 48:14.081
Don't ask!

49:02.042 --> 49:03.202
Check out cell â™ª15.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.991
Brother kwong, cell â™ª15!

49:15.083 --> 49:17.199
They came for the suspect!

49:19.167 --> 49:22.125
Open the door! They came for the suspect!

49:23.000 --> 49:24.080
Hurry!

49:41.042 --> 49:42.998
Open the door!

49:43.000 --> 49:44.080
I need to take the suspect with me.

49:44.083 --> 49:45.163
Wheelchair!

49:48.208 --> 49:49.994
Wheelchair!

49:51.083 --> 49:52.118
Get up slowly!

50:00.000 --> 50:02.207
Control to zone a, is everything ok?

50:02.208 --> 50:05.041
Yes, over!

50:05.083 --> 50:06.994
What happened?

50:08.125 --> 50:10.036
The prisoner escaped!

50:10.042 --> 50:12.158
We're dead! Let's split
up and look for him.

50:14.208 --> 50:15.994
Clear!

50:54.167 --> 50:56.123
What are you doing here?

50:57.208 --> 50:59.073
Stay where you are!

51:27.250 --> 51:29.206
What the fuck?

51:50.167 --> 51:51.247
Drive!

52:02.167 --> 52:03.077
Brother wah!

52:03.125 --> 52:05.207
We don't have to do this. We can go back.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.206
How? A cop's life is at stake.

52:07.250 --> 52:08.690
So what if we hand over the suspect?

52:09.000 --> 52:11.036
If they don't release him,
we'll all go to jail!

52:11.083 --> 52:12.198
We have no choice!

52:13.125 --> 52:14.240
Did you go out last night?

52:14.250 --> 52:16.115
A new bar just opened.

52:16.125 --> 52:17.240
The girls are beautiful.

52:18.083 --> 52:19.163
What the fuck?

52:37.125 --> 52:38.125
What happened?

52:39.083 --> 52:40.118
What happened?

52:44.000 --> 52:45.160
Go to cell â™ª69!

52:45.250 --> 52:47.036
Right away!

52:56.083 --> 52:59.041
It's open! Let's go!

52:59.083 --> 53:00.083
Quick!

53:08.250 --> 53:09.990
Who is it?

53:11.042 --> 53:13.078
Stop!

53:37.000 --> 53:39.286
You saw nothing, just walk away.

53:42.292 --> 53:44.078
Get them back

53:44.083 --> 53:46.039
or you'll spend the rest
of your life in here.

53:46.083 --> 53:47.083
What are you doing?

53:47.208 --> 53:50.041
Go back to your room!

53:56.125 --> 53:57.205
Women and children?
Why are they here?

53:57.208 --> 53:58.163
None of your business!

53:58.208 --> 53:59.994
He took my phone.

54:00.042 --> 54:02.158
We're dead if he makes a call.

54:14.208 --> 54:16.119
Come back!

54:30.000 --> 54:31.206
Take him to wong shek pier.

54:31.208 --> 54:32.243
Listen.

54:32.250 --> 54:33.990
I won't hand him over.

54:34.125 --> 54:35.226
If anything happens to my nephew,

54:35.250 --> 54:37.036
I'll carve out his heart.

54:37.083 --> 54:38.083
I'm telling you...

54:38.125 --> 54:39.285
You and your nephew are dead.

55:07.167 --> 55:08.167
Move away!

55:52.167 --> 55:53.202
Who told you to open fire?

55:53.208 --> 55:55.164
You're all dead if
anything happens to them.

55:55.167 --> 55:58.000
Don't shoot! Hold your fire!

55:58.083 --> 56:01.041
Don't shoot! Hold your fire!

56:01.208 --> 56:06.999
Move!

58:40.208 --> 58:41.208
Kit!

58:42.167 --> 58:43.167
Kit!

58:45.000 --> 58:47.036
Kit!

58:52.167 --> 58:53.167
Is that him?

58:56.208 --> 58:59.245
Trace the location of
the phone in Thailand.

59:00.250 --> 59:02.081
I'll do it.

59:03.125 --> 59:04.990
Give me 2 days.

59:05.083 --> 59:07.039
I don't think god will toy with us.

59:28.167 --> 59:29.998
Lee tai yun!

59:30.167 --> 59:32.123
Lee tai yun! Open the door!

59:34.000 --> 59:35.160
Are we friends?

59:52.042 --> 59:53.202
Will this work?

59:54.208 --> 59:56.073
I don't know.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.991
Why don't you call the ambulance?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.161
Don't fucking kill him! We need him alive!

01:00:06.208 --> 01:00:08.119
Yes sir!

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.117
I won't let my nephew get hurt.
Give me 3 days.

01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:18.288
Shit!

01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:25.994
Brother wah. I got it.

01:00:26.042 --> 01:00:29.000
The call is from a prison in Bangkok.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:33.115
Our guy may be inside. Please be careful.

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:39.036
Hello?

01:00:48.167 --> 01:00:49.202
What is it?

01:00:50.042 --> 01:00:52.033
I followed you here from the prison.

01:00:54.208 --> 01:00:55.994
What do you want?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.206
I want to see someone.

01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:28.205
Sal!

01:01:29.042 --> 01:01:30.248
Well?

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.992
No answer!

01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:42.990
Daddy!

01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:45.073
I'm scared.

01:01:54.292 --> 01:01:58.114
Sa, look at this little plant...

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.163
Before it starts to germinate,

01:02:04.083 --> 01:02:07.246
it's only a seed buried in the soil

01:02:08.042 --> 01:02:10.203
in complete darkness.

01:02:11.083 --> 01:02:14.075
It doesn't know what its
future will be like.

01:02:15.042 --> 01:02:17.249
Just like you and me.

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:20.123
We're both scared.

01:02:21.167 --> 01:02:24.239
That's why we must have hope.

01:02:26.167 --> 01:02:28.123
Just like the seed in the dark soil.

01:02:28.125 --> 01:02:32.243
As long as it doesn't give up,
germinate and grow,

01:02:32.292 --> 01:02:34.248
it will see sunlight someday.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.243
The world is full of miracles.

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:51.036
We must have hope.

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:53.115
Smile!

01:03:38.167 --> 01:03:39.282
Thank you!

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:52.081
Sweetie?

01:03:53.167 --> 01:03:55.032
Is the baby crying again?

01:03:55.083 --> 01:03:56.083
Yes.

01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:57.240
Where have you been?

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.992
Mom and dad are waiting for you.

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:03.081
Can you manage?

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:06.073
When will you be home?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.240
Why two of you?

01:04:11.208 --> 01:04:13.119
We have a lot to unload.

01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:18.243
Open up...

01:04:59.167 --> 01:05:00.247
Follow me!

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:02.081
Someone wants to see you.

01:05:09.208 --> 01:05:11.244
Sir, we traced them to Dr. Lee tai yun

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:15.118
148 reclamation street in yau ma tei.

01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:28.160
What are you doing?

01:05:32.167 --> 01:05:33.202
Do you know?

01:05:33.208 --> 01:05:35.164
You'll get us killed!

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.036
Trust me! It'll be alright.

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:48.114
Uncle!

01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:48.989
Kit!

01:05:49.042 --> 01:05:50.031
Uncle! Kit!

01:05:50.042 --> 01:05:50.997
Take it easy!

01:05:51.042 --> 01:05:53.033
Uncle! Kit!

01:05:53.125 --> 01:05:54.125
Stand still!

01:05:54.167 --> 01:05:55.167
Kit!

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.240
You have 15 minutes!

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.080
15 minutes only.

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:40.240
Take cover!

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:52.036
Watch him.

01:07:11.208 --> 01:07:13.073
When are you getting me out?

01:07:13.167 --> 01:07:15.123
I need to make sure you're in here,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.240
then I'll get you out.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.991
I have the culprit's brother.

01:07:20.042 --> 01:07:21.202
They wouldn't dare touch you.

01:08:17.917 --> 01:08:18.952
Take this money,

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:21.741
take your daughter away.

01:08:21.832 --> 01:08:24.825
I shouldn't have gotten you this job.

01:08:29.917 --> 01:08:30.917
Brother wah!

01:08:31.832 --> 01:08:33.698
We're screwed.

01:08:33.957 --> 01:08:36.745
They took the suspect.

01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:42.875
What is it?

01:08:43.832 --> 01:08:44.912
Big mouth is in trouble.

01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:47.908
The culprit abducted his brother.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:50.997
I came alone.

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:53.738
Kit!

01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:55.911
Look at me.

01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:57.865
We'll get through this.

01:08:58.875 --> 01:09:00.706
One step at a time,

01:09:00.792 --> 01:09:01.872
we can do it.

01:09:01.875 --> 01:09:02.875
Uncle!

01:09:06.707 --> 01:09:07.787
Do we have a way out?

01:09:08.792 --> 01:09:10.912
I'll get you out even
if I have to blow up this place.

01:09:11.792 --> 01:09:12.907
Tell me...

01:09:12.957 --> 01:09:14.788
How can I get him out?

01:09:14.875 --> 01:09:15.910
Money is not an issue.

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:16.917
Tell me!

01:09:22.875 --> 01:09:24.866
You're working very hard.

01:09:25.917 --> 01:09:28.703
Making a delivery at this hour?

01:09:40.707 --> 01:09:42.948
I let you in because we're like brothers.

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:45.786
How could you do this to me?

01:09:48.832 --> 01:09:49.787
Sorry, boss!

01:09:49.792 --> 01:09:50.792
Good!

01:09:50.957 --> 01:09:52.948
If I'm still your boss,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.707
I'm giving you a chance
to take care of him.

01:10:06.833 --> 01:10:08.789
But I won't force you.

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:22.910
Sa?

01:10:33.792 --> 01:10:37.705
We checked this girl's blood type.

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:39.869
I can save your daughter.

01:10:49.833 --> 01:10:53.826
Hla 100% matched.

01:10:55.708 --> 01:10:56.914
If you won't do it,

01:10:58.958 --> 01:11:01.870
I'll sell this girl to someone else.

01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:07.787
She's your last hope.

01:11:09.708 --> 01:11:10.708
I'll do it.

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:14.741
No...

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:16.832
No... no

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:38.908
A dead man is worthless.

01:11:46.792 --> 01:11:47.872
You're here!

01:11:49.958 --> 01:11:51.823
Thanks to you!

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:54.831
Or I won't be here so fast.

01:11:54.875 --> 01:11:55.955
Thank you!

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.956
Don't mention it, Mr. hung.

01:11:58.708 --> 01:12:00.028
If you hadn't saved me back then,

01:12:00.958 --> 01:12:02.744
I won't be here today.

01:12:06.833 --> 01:12:08.698
Nice tie!

01:12:09.875 --> 01:12:10.875
Thank you.

01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:23.706
Did you hear that?

01:12:27.708 --> 01:12:29.699
He thanked me.

01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:31.830
Did you hear that?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.991
Cops are not the only ones

01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:37.956
who can be selfless.

01:12:37.958 --> 01:12:39.823
You want to kill your own brother.

01:12:40.708 --> 01:12:42.699
You're worse than a dog.

01:12:42.875 --> 01:12:44.911
How many lives have I saved?

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:46.910
Do you have any idea?

01:12:49.792 --> 01:12:50.952
He's alive...

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:52.956
Because of me.

01:12:53.833 --> 01:12:55.698
Or else...

01:12:55.917 --> 01:12:58.909
They already fed him to
the dogs in Cambodia.

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:01.953
I take one life

01:13:02.708 --> 01:13:03.868
to save my own.

01:13:05.708 --> 01:13:06.914
What's wrong with that?

01:13:09.958 --> 01:13:11.789
He...

01:13:12.708 --> 01:13:13.948
Is my brother.

01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:17.744
What's between us,

01:13:17.792 --> 01:13:19.783
is none of your business.

01:13:22.875 --> 01:13:24.831
My life has been tough

01:13:25.875 --> 01:13:27.911
but I still came this far.

01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:29.823
Look at you!

01:13:30.792 --> 01:13:32.703
You had it easy,

01:13:32.958 --> 01:13:34.949
but you don't appreciate it

01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:39.700
and end up bleeding all over the place.

01:13:43.708 --> 01:13:45.699
Look at you...

01:13:45.792 --> 01:13:46.907
So pathetic!

01:13:48.875 --> 01:13:51.787
You sound more and more like a mad dog.

01:14:07.708 --> 01:14:09.699
Everyone is afraid to die.

01:14:10.833 --> 01:14:12.698
Tell you what...

01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:15.908
I'm sending you on your way.

01:14:23.708 --> 01:14:25.744
What an awful mess!

01:14:26.917 --> 01:14:28.782
Consider this a gift.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.786
Go ahead and sell them.

01:14:31.958 --> 01:14:32.993
Thank you!

01:14:35.792 --> 01:14:36.952
Surgery has been scheduled.

01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:39.706
We can start when your brother gets here.

01:14:40.708 --> 01:14:41.914
Call me when you're ready.

01:14:42.792 --> 01:14:44.703
Make it quick.

01:14:57.792 --> 01:15:00.750
Hello, I came to pick up the phone.

01:15:01.792 --> 01:15:02.827
Did you bring money?

01:15:02.833 --> 01:15:03.868
Yes!

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:05.868
Thank you!

01:15:07.875 --> 01:15:09.991
It's working. You're all set.

01:15:10.708 --> 01:15:11.788
Thank you!

01:15:13.792 --> 01:15:15.908
Your phone kept ringing.

01:15:16.792 --> 01:15:18.874
Look at that!

01:15:29.875 --> 01:15:31.831
Sa, where are you going?

01:15:31.833 --> 01:15:33.949
I want to be alone. It's a secret.

01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:37.868
Hello?

01:15:37.917 --> 01:15:39.782
Did you call me?

01:15:39.792 --> 01:15:40.893
I have a lot of missed calls.

01:15:40.917 --> 01:15:42.999
Excellent! I finally got ahold of you!

01:15:43.708 --> 01:15:44.823
What are you saying?

01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:45.833
Bye!

01:16:04.792 --> 01:16:07.750
The man called me!

01:16:48.958 --> 01:16:50.698
What is going on?

01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:52.955
Money?

01:17:37.792 --> 01:17:39.874
Sa, this is your godfather.

01:17:40.792 --> 01:17:41.907
Your daddy is working.

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:44.791
Let him finish working, ok?

01:17:45.833 --> 01:17:47.789
I'll tell him to call you later.

01:17:58.958 --> 01:18:00.789
We're leaving.

01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:02.750
Thank you.

01:18:50.875 --> 01:18:52.706
I told you

01:18:52.708 --> 01:18:55.780
not to wear that when you eat.

01:18:55.958 --> 01:18:58.916
Relax! Let's eat.

01:19:48.708 --> 01:19:50.790
Let's break out of here!

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:38.910
Uncle!

01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:57.750
Let's go!

01:20:57.875 --> 01:20:59.706
Take them away!

01:20:59.708 --> 01:21:00.743
Right!

01:21:10.875 --> 01:21:12.706
Get in!

01:21:31.875 --> 01:21:33.706
There's a car!

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.744
They're not here.

01:22:23.833 --> 01:22:25.698
It'll work.

01:22:47.917 --> 01:22:49.782
Run!

01:22:51.917 --> 01:22:53.782
Run!

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.786
Chai!

01:23:57.958 --> 01:23:59.823
What a moron.

01:23:59.833 --> 01:24:00.948
What a moron!

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:07.750
What happened to you?

01:24:07.792 --> 01:24:09.953
Give us a hand!

01:24:10.792 --> 01:24:11.792
Hurry!

01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:17.865
Call Hong Kong.

01:24:17.917 --> 01:24:19.782
We're going back tonight.

01:24:41.958 --> 01:24:44.119
Oh my god!

01:24:44.958 --> 01:24:45.958
What is it?

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.991
The girl has leukemia!

01:24:48.042 --> 01:24:49.157
Only the owner of the phone can save her.

01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:51.203
It'd be great if he would go to Thailand.

01:24:53.042 --> 01:24:54.122
You understand that?

01:24:54.167 --> 01:24:55.953
You bet!

01:25:01.125 --> 01:25:03.161
What is that? Who sent it?

01:25:03.208 --> 01:25:06.120
He's not the owner of the phone.

01:25:10.208 --> 01:25:13.200
I found this picture in the phone.

01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:16.162
Maybe he's the owner.

01:25:18.042 --> 01:25:20.954
He's sending me a picture of the owner.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.115
What?

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.161
Where can I make a long distance call?

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Excuse me!

01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:48.244
These belong to your friends,
please keep them!

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.035
Thank you!

01:26:23.958 --> 01:26:25.994
Daddy, where are you?

01:26:26.042 --> 01:26:29.079
I got through to his phone,
he sent me a picture.

01:26:29.958 --> 01:26:31.118
I'm sending it to you now.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.037
Nurse! Where are you?

01:26:40.958 --> 01:26:43.199
Sa! Come here!

01:27:08.208 --> 01:27:10.164
Nurse!

01:27:10.208 --> 01:27:11.994
I found him!

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.206
The man who can save me.

01:27:13.208 --> 01:27:16.951
I have his picture, that's him!

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.206
That's him! That's him!

01:27:19.042 --> 01:27:20.202
That's him! That's him!

01:27:21.042 --> 01:27:22.248
Why do you have my photo?

01:27:24.167 --> 01:27:28.957
We have assured you that
your bone marrow can save sa.

01:27:29.167 --> 01:27:35.083
But at this time,
we are unable to accept your donation.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.035
Why?

01:27:39.125 --> 01:27:42.993
By law, any drug user must quit

01:27:43.083 --> 01:27:47.201
for a minimum period of three years
before giving any donation.

01:27:51.250 --> 01:27:53.081
However,

01:27:53.125 --> 01:27:57.164
I don't think her condition could
withstand for another six months.

01:28:06.208 --> 01:28:07.994
I'm ss orry!

01:28:09.125 --> 01:28:11.207
I have done something bad in the past.

01:28:12.208 --> 01:28:14.244
I can't help you just yet.

01:28:39.125 --> 01:28:42.117
What if I wait for you?

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:54.074
I promise I'll live till
the day you can save me

01:29:24.208 --> 01:29:27.041
I'm sure you can.

01:29:44.958 --> 01:29:47.040
Thank you!

01:29:59.208 --> 01:30:01.995
Thank you!

01:30:12.167 --> 01:30:15.034
Hit him hard!

01:30:23.208 --> 01:30:27.030
Harder! What's wrong with you?

01:32:05.042 --> 01:32:07.078
You have a last wish?

01:32:07.958 --> 01:32:08.993
I want...

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.991
You dead.

01:32:18.125 --> 01:32:20.161
I can't help you with that.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.082
Start the surgery.

01:32:28.167 --> 01:32:30.203
I can't believe

01:32:31.042 --> 01:32:33.033
the guy who can save sa

01:32:35.167 --> 01:32:37.203
is your nephew.

01:32:38.042 --> 01:32:39.157
If you believe

01:32:39.208 --> 01:32:41.073
you can keep on going.

01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:43.206
God will not toy with us.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.206
Someday

01:32:47.208 --> 01:32:49.950
when you look back, you'll know...

01:32:50.208 --> 01:32:52.164
The wrong thing

01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:55.083
happens at the right time.

01:35:34.042 --> 01:35:35.998
Call the doctor!

01:36:12.125 --> 01:36:14.116
I gave you the money you needed.

01:36:14.208 --> 01:36:17.166
You needed someone to save your daughter,

01:36:17.208 --> 01:36:18.994
I found one for you.

01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:22.083
You think you have done a good deed?

01:36:28.958 --> 01:36:30.038
Hope...

01:36:30.125 --> 01:36:32.081
You won't get it every day.

01:36:39.083 --> 01:36:42.120
You killed your own daughter.

01:36:44.167 --> 01:36:46.954
Chop him up and feed him to the dogs.

01:36:46.958 --> 01:36:48.118
Yes, sir!

01:36:49.083 --> 01:36:51.039
Hold this!

01:36:52.958 --> 01:36:53.958
Hurry!

01:37:02.042 --> 01:37:02.952
Mr. hung?

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.206
You're not in surgery?

01:37:04.958 --> 01:37:06.118
Get over here!

01:37:07.042 --> 01:37:08.202
What happened?

01:37:08.250 --> 01:37:10.992
Bring the guy and get over here!

01:37:12.958 --> 01:37:14.198
You should have the address!

01:37:19.042 --> 01:37:21.078
Catch him!

01:37:21.083 --> 01:37:22.948
Hurry!

01:37:23.208 --> 01:37:24.948
Stop!

01:37:31.042 --> 01:37:32.157
Good evening.

01:37:40.083 --> 01:37:41.118
Sa?

01:37:42.083 --> 01:37:43.198
Where's sa?

01:38:09.958 --> 01:38:10.242
Find him!

01:38:10.958 --> 01:38:11.958
Right!

01:38:31.958 --> 01:38:33.164
Open it!

01:38:44.958 --> 01:38:45.993
Open it!

01:38:47.958 --> 01:38:49.198
Open it!

01:38:50.208 --> 01:38:53.951
I told you to open it.

01:38:54.167 --> 01:38:56.032
Moron.

01:39:01.042 --> 01:39:03.033
Open it slowly.

01:39:17.125 --> 01:39:20.037
What're you looking at?

01:39:31.167 --> 01:39:33.078
Mask!

01:39:35.167 --> 01:39:37.954
Can you promise me something?

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.161
Give this to daddy!

01:39:55.042 --> 01:39:56.953
Let the boss go,

01:39:56.958 --> 01:39:58.118
I'll let your friend go.

01:41:50.125 --> 01:41:54.118
Turn on the lights and lock the elevator.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.992
I'm the guy from Hong Kong
you've been looking for.

01:42:14.208 --> 01:42:15.994
Sal!

01:42:17.208 --> 01:42:19.995
Daddy, he sent me a picture.

01:42:20.042 --> 01:42:22.124
I'm sending it to you now.

01:42:28.208 --> 01:42:29.994
It's me!

01:42:40.875 --> 01:42:42.866
I won't make it.

01:42:43.792 --> 01:42:45.783
Without a doctor,

01:42:46.792 --> 01:42:48.953
your heart is useless to me.

01:42:50.042 --> 01:42:52.875
If you were not my brother,

01:42:55.792 --> 01:42:57.953
I would have done this over 10 years ago.

01:42:59.917 --> 01:43:01.953
I have no choice.

01:43:02.792 --> 01:43:03.907
But you do.

01:43:03.958 --> 01:43:05.038
Go!

01:43:07.917 --> 01:43:09.908
Hurry!

01:43:26.042 --> 01:43:27.953
Don't go!

01:43:28.042 --> 01:43:30.784
If you leave, I'll die!

01:44:49.875 --> 01:44:50.955
Are you alright?

01:49:32.875 --> 01:49:35.787
I can't see a thing!

01:50:04.833 --> 01:50:06.824
Too bright.

01:50:42.917 --> 01:50:44.032
Sal!

01:51:02.958 --> 01:51:04.823
Sal!

01:52:07.792 --> 01:52:12.081
Where will I go?

01:52:12.958 --> 01:52:15.870
Don't be afraid!

01:52:15.917 --> 01:52:16.952
You will be fine.

01:52:53.958 --> 01:52:55.073
You can't die!

01:52:55.792 --> 01:52:57.953
You need to save my daughter!

01:53:10.042 --> 01:53:13.990
I heard they looked for me for a long time.

01:53:14.083 --> 01:53:17.780
Luckily they found me in the end.

01:53:19.042 --> 01:53:22.864
A lot of things in life
are beyond our control.

01:53:25.875 --> 01:53:29.948
Just like the ice on the lake.

01:53:30.042 --> 01:53:34.957
No one knows when the ice will crack.

01:53:37.042 --> 01:53:41.786
I never told anyone what
happened that night.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.868
Because no one would believe

01:53:45.917 --> 01:53:49.830
there's a wolf in Bangkok.

01:53:49.833 --> 01:53:56.033
I'll never forget the way
the wolf looked at me.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.950
Daddy taught me to deal with fear

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:16.791
and have hope.

01:54:33.792 --> 01:54:35.908
Don't let go

01:54:35.917 --> 01:54:39.956
don't let me down

01:54:41.917 --> 01:54:44.954
I know it's far away

01:54:48.042 --> 01:54:50.875
I'll carry you

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.790
till I can't go on

01:54:57.083 --> 01:55:00.780
holding in the pain

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:11.000
I'll still carry on, I'll still carry on
