WEBVTT

00:02.872 --> 00:04.439
Here'’s what'’s going on.

00:04.526 --> 00:06.093
I have messed up big-time.

00:06.180 --> 00:08.312
I got us evicted, I'’m broke,

00:08.399 --> 00:10.662
my father'’s not talking to me,

00:10.749 --> 00:12.664
my daughter'’s not talking to me.

00:12.751 --> 00:14.927
I'’m talking to you.

00:15.015 --> 00:18.757
Yay...

00:21.586 --> 00:25.112
I just need to put a roof
over my family'’s head again,

00:25.199 --> 00:27.418
get my daughter
to come back home.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.681
I just don'’t know
where to start.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.683
I'’m so overwhelmed.
[chuckles]

00:31.770 --> 00:34.295
Anyway, thanks.

00:34.382 --> 00:37.037
[clears throat] Uh, hi, I'’m
Bonnie. I'’m an alcoholic.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.647
OTHERS:
Hi, Bonnie.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.649
I don'’t want to pile on,
but you all just heard

00:40.736 --> 00:42.085
what I'’m living with.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.306
You'’re not helping.
Hey,

00:45.393 --> 00:48.004
I didn'’t interrupt when
you shared. Anyway...

00:48.091 --> 00:50.615
[quietly]:
Yes, you did.

00:50.702 --> 00:53.923
I'’m a glass half-full
kind of gal,

00:54.010 --> 00:56.099
so I'’m not gonna look
at my daughter'’s failure

00:56.186 --> 00:58.797
as my failure.
That'’s it. Thanks.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.280
Can I go again?

01:07.371 --> 01:08.677
Good meeting.

01:08.764 --> 01:11.593
I can'’t wait
to put you in a home.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.945
Hi.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.947
Beth.
Hi.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.514
Really enjoyed
your share.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.516
Thanks.
Thanks.

01:21.603 --> 01:23.518
I might be able
to help you.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.389
I'’m a real estate agent.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.870
Oh. I know you
from the bus benches.

01:27.957 --> 01:30.829
Oh, yeah, I'’ve
sat on your face.

01:30.916 --> 01:32.657
A lot of people have.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.311
Anyway...

01:34.398 --> 01:35.747
I have a rental property

01:35.834 --> 01:37.532
that'’s a little ways
out of town,

01:37.619 --> 01:40.491
but I think it would be perfect
for you and your family.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.319
Is it free?

01:42.406 --> 01:44.669
No, but the owners
are very motivated.

01:44.756 --> 01:47.150
That'’s code for
"something'’s wrong with it."

01:47.237 --> 01:50.849
What, is it built on
a toxic waste dump or something?

01:50.936 --> 01:52.938
Of course not. And if you have
a little bit of time,

01:53.025 --> 01:54.636
I could drive you out there
right now.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.290
You could see for yourself.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.075
Okay.

01:59.162 --> 02:00.468
Okay.

02:03.862 --> 02:07.518
We would'’ve been okay
with toxic waste, right?

02:07.605 --> 02:09.041
Absolutely.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.479
We'’re done having kids.
What do we care?

02:14.003 --> 02:15.918
So that'’s three bedrooms
upstairs.

02:16.005 --> 02:20.183
Plus, the office down here
could easily be a fourth.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.490
Wow.
Yeah.

02:22.577 --> 02:25.754
Subzero appliances
in the kitchen, two-car garage,

02:25.841 --> 02:27.930
and your nearest neighbor
is a mile away

02:28.017 --> 02:30.411
so you'’ll have oodles
of privacy.

02:30.498 --> 02:34.023
Where was this place
when I was cooking meth?

02:37.548 --> 02:40.116
Beth, the house is fantastic,

02:40.203 --> 02:43.641
but it has got to be
way out of our price range.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.643
Even at $900 a month?

02:46.731 --> 02:49.647
What, did somebody die here?

02:49.734 --> 02:51.910
A few people.

02:54.739 --> 02:57.089
Let me show you
the patio.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.397
Built-in barbecue,
perfect for entertaining.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.834
Yeah, great.
Back it up a bit.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.488
Now, when you say

03:04.575 --> 03:08.144
a few people died,
what are we talking, old age?

03:08.231 --> 03:09.145
Triple homicide.

03:09.232 --> 03:10.277
Pretty messy.

03:10.364 --> 03:11.974
But...

03:12.061 --> 03:13.671
when they pulled up
the bloody carpet,

03:13.758 --> 03:15.673
look what they found--

03:15.760 --> 03:19.677
hardwood floors!

03:19.764 --> 03:23.072
That'’s the real crime,
hiding floors like these.

03:23.159 --> 03:24.769
Oh, my God.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.380
Can you give us a sec?

03:28.773 --> 03:30.862
[quietly]:
This is an incredible break.

03:30.949 --> 03:33.169
We have got to take it.
We'’ve got to take it right now.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.344
Are you crazy?

03:34.431 --> 03:35.867
People were
murdered here.

03:35.954 --> 03:38.130
And we cannot bring them back.
But...

03:40.045 --> 03:41.438
...we can honor their memory

03:41.525 --> 03:43.875
every time we fire up
that Jacuzzi.

03:43.962 --> 03:46.530
No. Absolutely not.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.010
It'’s too creepy.

03:48.097 --> 03:50.012
What-what was it, like,
a drug deal gone bad?

03:50.099 --> 03:51.840
Were they criminals,
had it coming?

03:51.927 --> 03:54.277
No, a Sunday school teacher,
his wife,

03:54.364 --> 03:57.149
their teenage son,
and the family dog.

03:57.237 --> 04:01.153
Aw, the dog?
Not the dog.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.547
Yes, terrible tragedy.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.201
So what do you think?

04:07.421 --> 04:08.987
I really need an answer
right now

04:09.074 --> 04:11.033
because I have other families
who are interested.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.687
No, you don'’t.

04:14.036 --> 04:16.517
Come here. Come here.

04:16.603 --> 04:18.214
Do you want Violet to
move back in with us?

04:18.301 --> 04:20.041
Of course.
This'’ll do it.

04:20.129 --> 04:22.305
A beautiful place
we can call our own.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.567
Yeah, but...And it'’s not like

04:23.654 --> 04:26.178
there'’s gonna be
another murder here.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.745
She'’s right--
statistically speaking,

04:27.832 --> 04:30.313
this is safer
than a non-murder house.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.407
[sighs]

04:37.494 --> 04:40.236
Beth, a good mother
would never put her children

04:40.323 --> 04:41.933
in this kind of environment.

04:42.020 --> 04:43.413
So that'’s a no?

04:43.500 --> 04:45.328
You didn'’t let me finish.

05:04.347 --> 05:05.392
Forget the TV commercials.

05:05.479 --> 05:06.915
When you love your cats,

05:07.002 --> 05:09.004
you don'’t feed '’em
out of a can or a box.

05:09.091 --> 05:12.660
Everything I eat'’s
out of a can or a box.

05:12.747 --> 05:15.315
Well, not while you'’re living
with your Aunt Marjorie.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.794
Hit it.

05:16.881 --> 05:17.969
[whirring]

05:18.056 --> 05:20.276
Whoa, this is awesome!

05:22.583 --> 05:24.193
Hey, we'’re
back!

05:24.280 --> 05:27.196
Roscoe, I brought you
some chicken nuggets.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.678
See? Box.

05:30.765 --> 05:33.028
I'’ll make you a bowl
of spaghetti later.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.856
Thanks.

05:34.943 --> 05:37.467
How was the meeting?

05:37.554 --> 05:38.903
Terrific. And...

05:38.990 --> 05:40.165
good news,

05:40.252 --> 05:41.602
we found a place to live.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.430
Oh. Really?

05:43.517 --> 05:45.127
Not just a place.

05:45.214 --> 05:47.956
A four-bedroom, furnished house
out in Browns Valley.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.131
Oh, wow.

05:49.218 --> 05:51.351
How can you afford that?

05:51.438 --> 05:54.658
We got an incredible deal
because...

05:54.745 --> 05:57.182
[whispering]:
a family was murdered there.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.227
Oh.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.707
And their dog.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.230
Aw...

06:01.317 --> 06:03.885
But the best part is, we will

06:03.972 --> 06:05.800
be out of your hair
by the end of the week.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.628
Okay. Well,

06:07.715 --> 06:09.543
you'’re not really in my hair.

06:09.630 --> 06:12.067
But you said
we were a huge pain in the ass.

06:12.154 --> 06:14.069
I said that about you.

06:16.114 --> 06:19.379
But you and Roscoe
are always welcome here.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.381
Thanks, Marjorie.
You'’re the best.

06:21.468 --> 06:24.645
But... I'’ve got to put
my family back together.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.864
I understand.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.562
I'’ll miss you.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.302
I'’ll miss you, too.

06:31.826 --> 06:34.089
I'’m a little sad about all this.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.091
So if you'’ll excuse me.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.181
What a great lady.

06:39.268 --> 06:42.010
Yeah, I don'’t buy it.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.925
There'’s something
wrong with her.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.840
Something'’s wrong with you.

06:45.927 --> 06:48.320
Did you ever consider that there
might be people in this world

06:48.408 --> 06:51.411
who are simply kind
and compassionate?

06:51.498 --> 06:53.064
I used to think that.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.284
And then I turned nine.

06:55.371 --> 06:58.418
Great. You win.
You'’re dead inside.

06:58.505 --> 06:59.941
And don'’t you forget it.

07:00.028 --> 07:02.596
Now call Violet
and tell her we got a home.

07:02.683 --> 07:03.727
Where you going?

07:03.814 --> 07:04.728
I, uh...

07:04.815 --> 07:06.774
I have some errands to run.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.689
If you'’re going
to the drugstore, we'’re out

07:08.776 --> 07:10.430
of toothpaste, toilet paper...Oh, my God.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.867
Clearly I'’m lying.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.742
Yeah, he'’s showing up for work
regular.

07:18.829 --> 07:21.441
How the hell
would I know if he'’s using?

07:21.528 --> 07:23.355
Listen, my friend,
I just run a body shop.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.183
You'’re his parole officer.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.795
Get off your fat ass, come down
here, and make him pee in a cup.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.884
[knocking]

07:29.971 --> 07:31.407
Hello.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.453
Okay, I got to go, Susan.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.716
Sorry I called you fat.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.675
This is a surprise.

07:38.762 --> 07:39.850
I just thought I'’d stop by

07:39.937 --> 07:41.330
and see how you'’re feeling.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.158
Doctor says the
ticker'’s all good.

07:43.245 --> 07:45.334
All systems go.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.336
Oh. Nice.

07:47.423 --> 07:48.816
Mm-hmm.

07:48.903 --> 07:51.732
Mmm.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.473
So what'’s going on?

07:53.560 --> 07:55.779
I just thought we needed
to discuss a few things.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.607
I didn'’t want to do it
on the phone.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.914
Okay.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.263
It'’s about our daughter.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.265
Okay.

08:06.747 --> 08:09.271
I assume she told
you what went down.

08:09.358 --> 08:10.838
She did, and I just thought

08:10.925 --> 08:11.926
you might'’ve been
a little rough on her.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.797
You'’re kidding, right?

08:13.884 --> 08:15.495
Who skips out in the middle
of the night to beat the rent?

08:15.582 --> 08:18.802
Do I have to remind you
about that cute little bungalow

08:18.889 --> 08:21.109
we had up near Eureka? 1976.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.503
We took a bunch of acid,
made love on the kitchen floor,

08:23.590 --> 08:26.157
and ran off like a couple
of thieves.

08:26.244 --> 08:29.987
[laughing]:
That was not me.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.164
Really?

08:34.251 --> 08:36.951
No.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.518
[laughing]

08:38.605 --> 08:41.085
Oh. Um...

08:41.172 --> 08:42.913
The point is...

08:44.698 --> 08:47.048
...Christy knows
she made a mistake

08:47.135 --> 08:48.702
and she'’ll never do it again.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.704
Yeah. Terrific.

08:50.791 --> 08:54.534
So in the meantime, she and the
kids are living like gypsies?

08:54.621 --> 08:56.753
Actually, she found a really
nice house out in the country,

08:56.840 --> 08:58.363
and it wouldn'’t be a bad idea

08:58.450 --> 08:59.974
if you were to visit
and make peace.

09:00.061 --> 09:02.542
I don'’t know.
Let me think about it.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.195
Well, don'’t think too long,
if you ever want to have

09:04.282 --> 09:06.502
your own kitchen floor memories.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.156
Really?

09:08.243 --> 09:10.680
You'’re trading sex
for forgiveness?

09:10.767 --> 09:13.074
Would you rather
pay cash?

09:14.684 --> 09:17.121
Hi, Violet, it'’s Mom.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.384
How'’s it going
at your new place?

09:19.471 --> 09:22.823
[people shouting,
hip-hop music playing loudly]Sweet. I love it here.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.651
What'’s all that noise?

09:24.738 --> 09:27.741
[siren wailing]Oh, I'’m just watching TV.

09:27.828 --> 09:30.570
Okay, well, listen,
I-I wanted you to know

09:30.657 --> 09:33.007
that, um,
I found a beautiful house

09:33.094 --> 09:36.184
out in the country,
fully furnished, Jacuzzi.

09:36.271 --> 09:38.316
Really?Yep.

09:38.403 --> 09:39.927
If you wanted to come back,

09:40.014 --> 09:41.537
you'’d have your own
bedroom and bathroom.

09:41.624 --> 09:42.843
No reason you couldn'’t

09:42.930 --> 09:44.322
invite your friends

09:44.409 --> 09:46.237
to come visit you there,
throw some parties.

09:46.324 --> 09:47.761
Sound good?

09:47.848 --> 09:49.632
[people shouting,
dog barking over phone]

09:49.719 --> 09:50.764
Violet?

09:50.851 --> 09:52.287
Hello?

09:52.374 --> 09:53.636
[siren blaring, dog barking]

09:53.723 --> 09:55.595
Thank you, God!
Thank you, God!

10:02.602 --> 10:03.864
This refrigerator
is huge

10:03.951 --> 10:05.082
I mean, you could
put a body in here.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.785
Why would you say that?

10:11.872 --> 10:13.874
Because it'’s big?

10:15.658 --> 10:18.966
Well... you couldn'’t fit
a bodyin there.

10:19.053 --> 10:22.404
You know, you'’d
have to chop it up.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.934
Please stop talking.

10:34.677 --> 10:37.201
Killer house, guys.

10:37.288 --> 10:39.160
You mean nicehouse.

10:39.247 --> 10:40.683
Yeah.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.729
Then you should say that.

10:44.469 --> 10:47.734
Remind me to play
poker with you.

10:49.126 --> 10:51.651
Hey, can you keep an eye
on Roscoe

10:51.738 --> 10:53.870
while we go into town
for groceries?

10:53.957 --> 10:58.179
Absolutely. I give you my word
I will not get high.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.398
Violet, can you keep an eye
on Roscoe

11:00.485 --> 11:02.313
while we go into town
for groceries?

11:02.400 --> 11:03.488
Yeah. I got it.

11:03.575 --> 11:06.013
I'’m so happy to have you back.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.623
I know.

11:07.710 --> 11:10.147
Hey, look what I found
wrapped around the doghouse.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.019
Hmm...

11:12.106 --> 11:15.370
Why would there be police tape
wrapped around a doghouse?

11:15.457 --> 11:18.765
Maybe he was a crime-fighting
dog like Scooby-Doo.

11:19.896 --> 11:22.594
Oh, sure, that explains it.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.339
Christy.
Check it out.

11:28.426 --> 11:30.211
Pickles in a barrel.

11:30.298 --> 11:32.039
[gasps] Cool.
Should we get some?No.

11:32.126 --> 11:35.433
I just dropped my gum in it.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.218
Howdy.Howdy.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.436
Howdy.

11:38.523 --> 11:41.918
Look at us-- saying "howdy."

11:42.005 --> 11:44.355
Haven'’t seen you gals
around here before.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.662
Yeah. We'’re, uh, just
moving into the neighborhood.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.229
[quietly]:
"Gals." I love it.

11:48.316 --> 11:51.362
It'’s so much better
than "bitches."

11:51.449 --> 11:52.712
Where you living?

11:52.799 --> 11:55.236
Just up the road
a piece.

11:55.323 --> 11:58.152
"A piece"?When in Rome.

11:58.239 --> 12:00.502
We'’re, uh, renting the
white clapboard house

12:00.589 --> 12:02.243
at the end of Magnolia.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.374
The Williams place?

12:03.461 --> 12:04.767
I guess.

12:04.854 --> 12:06.073
You do know what happened there?

12:06.160 --> 12:07.727
We know.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.903
We also know we got hardwood
floors and a Jacuzzi.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.774
Anyway, it was

12:11.861 --> 12:14.777
a long time ago,
and we'’re just really grateful

12:14.864 --> 12:17.084
to live in such
a beautiful home.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.738
Actually, it was
only nine months ago,

12:18.825 --> 12:20.740
and they never caught
the man who did it.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.570
What'’s that you say?Well, the papers

12:25.657 --> 12:26.963
called him "the Fisherman"

12:27.050 --> 12:28.878
on account
of him gutting everybody.

12:31.011 --> 12:31.968
Gutting?

12:32.055 --> 12:33.622
And filleting.

12:35.232 --> 12:36.756
Filleting?

12:36.843 --> 12:38.496
He did everything

12:38.583 --> 12:40.672
but bread '’em
and dip '’em in tartar sauce.

12:42.892 --> 12:44.459
Eh, that'’s enough jibber-jabber.

12:44.546 --> 12:46.113
Let me ring you up.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.897
"Jibber-jabber."

12:47.984 --> 12:49.986
It'’s not cute anymore!

12:52.946 --> 12:54.512
[inhales]

12:57.341 --> 12:59.256
Sacrifices I make for my kid.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.605
[crunching footsteps]

13:00.692 --> 13:02.259
Hello?

13:03.652 --> 13:06.263
Roscoe? Violet?

13:06.350 --> 13:08.657
Weird.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.311
[inhales]

13:10.398 --> 13:12.008
[crunching footsteps]

13:12.095 --> 13:14.663
Hello?

13:14.750 --> 13:17.318
[crunching footstep]

13:17.405 --> 13:18.972
Curious.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.280
Hello?

13:23.367 --> 13:26.196
Anybody out here?

13:26.283 --> 13:28.808
Oh, God!
Oh, God, get off me! Oh!

13:28.895 --> 13:31.506
Baxter?
Are you okay?

13:31.593 --> 13:34.552
No! I just walked
through a spiderweb!

13:37.991 --> 13:40.820
Hey.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.172
Hey.

13:46.782 --> 13:49.002
Everything all right?

13:50.133 --> 13:51.395
[gulps, exhales]

13:51.482 --> 13:52.744
Great.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.921
Here, let me
take that from you.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.923
Thanks.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.881
Hey, were you guys
just walking around outside

13:58.968 --> 14:01.188
in the backyard?No. Why?

14:01.275 --> 14:03.973
Nothing. Just thought
I heard somebody out there.

14:05.148 --> 14:06.846
It'’s starting.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.022
Stop it.

14:09.109 --> 14:11.024
How high are you?

14:11.111 --> 14:12.852
No more than usual.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.288
Just '’cause
he'’s stoned

14:14.375 --> 14:16.029
doesn'’t mean he was
imagining it.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.552
It usually does.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.423
Did you see anyone?

14:19.510 --> 14:22.774
Hang on. Don'’t want to blow up
a fart from the inside.

14:23.819 --> 14:24.994
[exhales]:
Ah...

14:25.081 --> 14:27.127
Just heard someone.

14:27.214 --> 14:30.217
That'’s it. I don'’t want
to stay here tonight.Would you relax?

14:30.304 --> 14:32.393
But what if it was
the Fisherman?Who'’s the Fisherman?

14:32.480 --> 14:33.742
He'’s the madman who murdered

14:33.829 --> 14:35.135
all the people
who lived in this house.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.224
All of them?
And their dog.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.617
Aw.

14:39.704 --> 14:42.185
Violet and Roscoe
cannot know about this.

14:42.272 --> 14:45.058
I wish Ididn'’t know about this.

14:45.145 --> 14:47.538
[thunder crashing]

14:47.625 --> 14:51.107
Hey, would you think less
of me if I left right now?

14:51.194 --> 14:52.456
Yes.

14:52.543 --> 14:53.980
How much less?

14:54.067 --> 14:55.155
All right,

14:55.242 --> 14:56.634
I want you both
to listen to me.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.941
There is no one
out there.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.900
There is nothing
to be afraid of

15:00.987 --> 15:03.380
except what'’s in
our own heads.

15:03.467 --> 15:04.904
I guess you'’re right.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.731
And I guarantee you
it'’ll go a long way

15:06.818 --> 15:08.603
toward showing your father
you'’re not a total screwup.

15:08.690 --> 15:09.996
You'’re right.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.563
If I run away
from this place...

15:12.650 --> 15:14.478
I'’m running away
from happiness.

15:14.565 --> 15:15.784
That'’s my girl.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.438
[pounding on door]

15:19.831 --> 15:21.964
Would you mind getting that?

15:22.051 --> 15:23.923
I do mind.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.533
Baxter, you'’re the man.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.187
Disagree.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.973
[pounding on door]

15:31.060 --> 15:32.583
Come on, we'’ll all get it.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.070
If that'’s the Fisherman
out there,

15:41.157 --> 15:42.724
I just want you to know...

15:44.030 --> 15:45.770
...you were a terrible mother.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.342
Hello?

15:53.517 --> 15:54.910
Who'’s there?

16:04.311 --> 16:05.486
Hey!

16:05.573 --> 16:07.488
[all scream]

16:07.575 --> 16:11.187
Whoa. You trying to give me
another heart attack?

16:11.274 --> 16:12.623
Oh! Daddy!

16:12.710 --> 16:14.364
I'’m so glad it'’s you!

16:14.451 --> 16:15.757
Oh, I'’m sorry
I scared you.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.150
I was outside
knocking and knocking,

16:17.237 --> 16:19.152
and then I just
came in the back.

16:19.239 --> 16:20.762
VIOLET:
What'’s going on?

16:20.849 --> 16:23.069
Nothing. It'’s...
just Grandpa.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.201
So...

16:25.288 --> 16:27.160
how'’d you even know
we were here?

16:27.247 --> 16:28.944
Your mom told me--
said I should come by

16:29.031 --> 16:30.641
and straighten things out
with you.

16:30.728 --> 16:34.297
Oh.

16:34.384 --> 16:37.866
I'’m sorry about that
"terrible mom" crack.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.433
Eh, it'’s okay.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.088
I don'’t listen to you.

16:42.175 --> 16:45.178
Anyway, I'’m sorry
I was so hard on you.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.788
I love you.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.659
I love you, too.

16:51.271 --> 16:54.622
Just promise me you
won'’t run out of your house
in the middle of the night

16:54.709 --> 16:56.102
because things
aren'’t going your way.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.234
I promise.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.062
[pounding on door]

17:00.149 --> 17:01.542
[thunder crashes]

17:01.629 --> 17:02.891
Run!

17:02.978 --> 17:04.806
[several screaming]

17:04.893 --> 17:06.851
[knocking]

17:10.159 --> 17:12.248
Funny story.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.300
I can'’t believe you guys
rented a house

17:21.387 --> 17:23.041
where people were murdered.

17:23.128 --> 17:25.608
Wait'’ll youhave
no credit rating.

17:25.695 --> 17:29.744
Are you, uh... gonna go back
to your friend'’s place tomorrow?

17:29.831 --> 17:32.138
No, I think I'’ll stick
around for a while.

17:32.225 --> 17:33.617
Really?

17:33.704 --> 17:35.315
You need me, Mom.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.969
I do.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.885
I say we get a couple
of guns and go back.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.757
Are you serious?

17:42.844 --> 17:45.325
The guy had a fishhook--
who wins thatshowdown?

17:47.762 --> 17:51.940
Okay, I just tucked in Alvin,
Roscoe and Baxter

17:52.027 --> 17:53.550
in the guest room.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.248
Thanks, Marjorie.

17:55.335 --> 17:57.641
Everybody snuggled and cozy
out here?

17:57.728 --> 17:59.252
Yeah. We'’re great.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.123
Okay, see you all
in the morning.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.647
Night, Marjorie.Night.

18:03.734 --> 18:06.346
You know, I'’m sorry things
didn'’t work out

18:06.433 --> 18:08.609
at your new house,
but I got to admit,

18:08.696 --> 18:10.959
I'’m happy you'’re back--
I missed you.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.700
We missed you, too.

18:12.787 --> 18:14.658
And, Bonnie,
I know we give each other

18:14.745 --> 18:16.399
a hard time, but...

18:16.486 --> 18:18.619
my life is better
with you in it.

18:18.706 --> 18:21.622
Thanks, Marjorie.
Same here.

18:21.709 --> 18:24.146
Night.
Night.

18:26.017 --> 18:28.498
I take back everything
I ever said about that woman.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.457
She'’s an angel.

18:30.544 --> 18:33.199
I don'’t know what we
would do without her.
