<i>Now, I don't really believe</i>

02:19.539 --> 02:21.690
<i>But when things go wrong,</i>

02:21.708 --> 02:23.859
<i>It kind of helps if you can</i>
<i>blame it on something.</i>

02:24.661 --> 02:27.162
<i>And for me,</i>
<i>things went wrong a lot.</i>

02:28.748 --> 02:30.249
Oh, jeez! Oh!

02:30.967 --> 02:32.634
<i>Grandpa says our</i>

02:34.254 --> 02:37.890
<i>Could a pair of shoes falling</i>

02:37.924 --> 02:40.058
Come here, boy!
Hey, why you runnin'?
<i>Hold it right there!</i>

02:40.093 --> 02:41.760
<i>Did you steal those shoes?</i>
<i>Officer,</i>
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

02:42.395 --> 02:43.562
<i>Female officer:</i>

<i>Stanley yelnats iii,</i>

<i>And for the last few years,</i>

02:52.438 --> 02:53.689
<i>For foot odor.</i>

02:53.723 --> 02:55.490
<i>[ laughs ]</i>
<i>I'm glad you're here.</i>

02:55.725 --> 02:58.393
This whole floor
smells like stinky feet.

03:01.781 --> 03:04.283
What did you do
to my stanley?

03:04.334 --> 03:05.868
Don't freak out.
It's a bruise.

03:07.170 --> 03:10.205
Can I just say
right off the bat,
this is a big mistake.

03:10.239 --> 03:12.374
Don't say nothing
until we talk
to our lawyer!

03:12.859 --> 03:15.410
<i>You're gonna be sorry</i>
<i>you ever messed</i>
<i>with stanley yelnats!</i>

03:16.095 --> 03:17.129
Let me see that.

03:17.180 --> 03:18.747
Just don't grab it
out of their hands.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.382
Why not?
Because you're
gonna make 'em angry.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.351
<i>Would you like</i>

03:22.385 --> 03:23.769
<i>Male officer: Excuse me.</i>

03:24.137 --> 03:27.222
<i>How about some coffee?</i>
<i>A little cup of coffee?</i>

03:32.946 --> 03:34.947
<i>Now, that is a fine</i>
<i>pair of shoes.</i>

03:36.265 --> 03:37.449
Could I just
smell your shoe?

03:38.034 --> 03:40.369
<i>How about if you</i>

<i>and I'll just --</i>

03:40.937 --> 03:42.371
<i>Male officer:</i>
<i>Check the bedroom.</i>

03:42.405 --> 03:44.272
<i>Stanley ii: Just a minute!</i>
<i>Where you going?!</i>

03:44.290 --> 03:45.741
This warrant
isn't warranted!

03:45.942 --> 03:47.376
<i>This will never hold up</i>
<i>in court!</i>

03:47.777 --> 03:49.962
<i>Female officer:</i>
<i>Uh-huh. Here it is.</i>

03:49.996 --> 03:51.246
We got him.

03:51.280 --> 03:52.664
<i>We share the room.</i>

03:52.715 --> 03:55.050
How do you know
that's not mine?

03:55.084 --> 03:56.418
Which bed is yours?

03:56.452 --> 03:57.803
You don't have
to answer that.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.287
We have the right
to remain silent.

03:59.305 --> 04:00.455
Oh, wouldn't that
be nice.

04:00.473 --> 04:01.974
I sleep here.

04:02.475 --> 04:04.843
It's all because of your
no-good, dirty-rotten,

04:05.061 --> 04:07.145
Pig-stealing
great-great-grandfather.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.680
There is no curse
on this family.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.232
There is on the  <i>men</i>
<i>in this family.</i>

04:10.633 --> 04:12.684
<i>¶"if only, if only," ¶</i>

04:12.735 --> 04:13.986

<i>¶"the bark on the tree</i>
<i>was as soft as the skies" ¶</i>

04:17.473 --> 04:19.808
Please don't
sing that song,
not at my table!

04:19.826 --> 04:22.527
Ma, relax.
I don't believe in
the curse, anyways.

04:23.112 --> 04:24.696
<i>We're gonna need</i>
<i>a damn good lawyer.</i>

04:24.747 --> 04:26.481
We can't afford
a lawyer, pop.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.918
We don't need a lawyer,
stanley. We'll just
tell the truth.

04:29.953 --> 04:31.586
<i>Stanley yelnats,</i>
<i>please rise.</i>

04:36.542 --> 04:38.310
Stanley yelnats iv.

04:38.544 --> 04:39.828
Sit down!

04:42.632 --> 04:44.182
I could send you to jail,

04:44.384 --> 04:46.518
<i>And I would not lose</i>
<i>one bit of sleep over it.</i>

04:48.137 --> 04:50.005
But I don't know
what good that would do.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.226
<i>There is currently a vacancy</i>
<i>at camp green lake.</i>

04:55.311 --> 04:57.529

build character.

04:58.448 --> 05:00.365
<i>The choice is yours...</i>

05:00.767 --> 05:03.652
Camp green lake...Or jail.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.240
Uh, well,
I never have been
to camp before.

05:08.908 --> 05:11.043
18 months,
camp green lake, son.

05:21.704 --> 05:25.724

06:04.263 --> 06:05.797
<i>¶you keep your eyes down</i>

06:07.917 --> 06:10.102
<i>¶you keep your eyes down</i>

06:11.304 --> 06:12.521
Thanks for the ride.

06:12.555 --> 06:14.606
<i>¶you keep your eyes down</i>

06:17.527 --> 06:19.094
<i>Man: Yo, fresh meat!</i>

06:22.281 --> 06:24.282
So, uh, where's the lake?

06:24.767 --> 06:27.369
Hey, what did
I just tell you?
Don't be a wise guy.

06:27.403 --> 06:28.603
Follow me.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.249
<i>Sit down.</i>

06:51.477 --> 06:53.178
What's with
the sunflower seeds, man?

06:53.646 --> 06:55.313
I give up smokin'.

06:57.299 --> 06:58.967
Stanley yelnats...

07:01.270 --> 07:03.021
...The fourth?
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:03.606 --> 07:05.490
Everyone in my family names
their son stanley

07:05.525 --> 07:08.193
'cause it's
yelnats backwards.

07:08.494 --> 07:10.328
It's like this --
it's a little --

07:11.731 --> 07:12.998
It's a --

07:13.666 --> 07:15.267
It's a tradition.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.671
My name is mr. Sir.

07:20.256 --> 07:23.141
<i>Whenever you speak to me,</i>
<i>you will call me by my name,</i>
<i>[ snickering ]</i>

07:23.492 --> 07:25.010
Is that clear?

07:25.044 --> 07:26.211
Yes, mr. Sir.

07:30.433 --> 07:32.050
Do you think that's funny?

07:32.101 --> 07:33.185
<i>Huh?</i>

07:34.003 --> 07:35.020
No, mr. Sir.

07:35.054 --> 07:37.272
This isn't
a girl scout camp.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.007
Understand?

07:41.310 --> 07:42.561
Here.

07:46.682 --> 07:48.733
Boy, you're
a bag o' tricks.

07:49.318 --> 07:50.569
Thanks.

07:51.571 --> 07:52.704
You thirsty, stanley?

07:54.106 --> 07:55.323
Yes, mr. Sir.

07:55.357 --> 07:56.625
Well, you better
get used to it.

07:56.659 --> 07:59.294
You're gonna be thirsty
for the next 18 months.

08:05.001 --> 08:07.886
Look around you, yelnats.
What do you see?

08:07.920 --> 08:09.588
Any guard towers?

08:10.539 --> 08:12.540
How about
an electric fence?

08:12.558 --> 08:13.725
Hmm?

08:13.759 --> 08:15.210
No, mr. Sir.

08:16.045 --> 08:17.846
You want to run away?

08:18.814 --> 08:20.182
Go ahead, start running.

08:20.216 --> 08:21.850
I won't stop you.

08:23.186 --> 08:24.819
I'm warnin' you!

08:24.854 --> 08:26.554
You heard the man,
spence.

08:29.992 --> 08:31.576
Oh, don't worry.

08:32.410 --> 08:34.078
This here's
for yellow-spotted lizards.

08:34.113 --> 08:35.496
I wouldn't waste a bullet
on you.

08:37.066 --> 08:38.416
I'm not gonna run away,
mr. Sir.

08:38.668 --> 08:39.734
Good thinkin', yelnats.

08:39.751 --> 08:41.919
Doesn't nobody run away
from here. You know why?

08:42.421 --> 08:44.789
We got the only water
for 100 miles --

08:44.840 --> 08:46.208
Our own little oasis.

08:46.242 --> 08:49.044
You want to run away,
them buzzards
will pick you clean

08:49.078 --> 08:50.578
By the end
of the third day.

08:55.184 --> 08:56.851
<i>Man: Hi, mr. Sir.</i>

09:01.090 --> 09:02.724
<i>Mr. Sir: Undress.</i>

09:05.761 --> 09:07.279
<i>You get two sets</i>
<i>of clothes --</i>

09:07.563 --> 09:09.948
One for work,
one for relaxation.

09:09.982 --> 09:12.284
<i>After three days,</i>
<i>your work clothes</i>
<i>will be washed,</i>

09:12.318 --> 09:14.319
Your second set
becomes your work clothes.

09:14.370 --> 09:16.238
<i>Is that clear?</i>
<i>Yes, mr. Sir.</i>

09:16.605 --> 09:19.040
<i>You are to dig one hole</i>
<i>each day --</i>

09:19.792 --> 09:22.110
5-foot deep,
5-foot in diameter.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.713
Your shovel
is your measuring stick.

09:24.914 --> 09:26.665
<i>The longer it takes you</i>
<i>to dig,</i>

09:26.949 --> 09:28.383
The longer you'll be out
in the hot sun.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.553
<i>Sorry, mr. Sir.</i>

09:33.256 --> 09:37.509
You need to keep alert
for lizards
and rattlesnakes.

09:38.844 --> 09:40.061
Rattlesnakes?

09:40.096 --> 09:43.231
<i>You don't bother them,</i>
<i>they won't bother you...</i>

09:43.266 --> 09:44.516
Usually.

09:44.967 --> 09:48.136
<i>Being bit by a rattler</i>
<i>ain't the worst thing</i>
<i>that can happen to you.</i>

09:48.154 --> 09:50.105
You won't die, usually.

09:51.524 --> 09:54.475
But you don't want to get bit
by a yellow-spotted lizard.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.145
<i>That</i>  is  <i>the worst thing</i>
<i>that can happen to you.</i>

09:57.363 --> 10:00.248
You will die
a slow and painful death...

10:01.917 --> 10:03.318
...Always.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.087
Stanley yelnats?

10:06.122 --> 10:08.039
Yeah?
I just want you to know

10:08.090 --> 10:09.991
That you may have done
some bad things,

10:10.009 --> 10:12.627
But that does not
make you a bad kid.

10:13.095 --> 10:14.879
I respect you, stanley.

10:15.848 --> 10:17.515
<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>camp green lake.</i>

10:17.550 --> 10:19.601
I'm dr. Pendanski,
your counselor.

10:20.169 --> 10:22.637
Start that touchy-feely crap,
I'm outta here.

10:23.022 --> 10:26.274
Give him some towels,
tokens. Set him up.

10:28.477 --> 10:29.644
<i>You'll be in "d" tent.</i>

10:29.678 --> 10:32.314
"d" stands for "diligence."
that's the mess hall.

10:32.348 --> 10:34.399
<i>There's the rec room.</i>
<i>And there's the showers.</i>

10:34.450 --> 10:37.402
There's only one knob
'cause there's only one
temperature -- cold.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.904
And that's the warden's
cabin over there.

10:39.955 --> 10:42.457
<i>That's the number-one rule</i>
<i>at camp green lake --</i>

10:42.491 --> 10:44.025
Do not upset the warden.

10:44.043 --> 10:45.293
Yeah,
he seemed kind of --

10:45.328 --> 10:46.411
Who?

10:46.612 --> 10:47.796
Oh, mr. Sir?

10:47.830 --> 10:49.547
Oh, he's not the warden.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.584
<i>He's just been</i>
<i>in a bad mood</i>
<i>since he quit smokin'.</i>

10:52.635 --> 10:54.035
Hey, mom...

10:54.503 --> 10:56.371
Who's the neanderthal?

10:56.639 --> 10:58.206
<i>This is stanley.</i>

10:58.641 --> 11:00.375
So, what's happening
with barf bag?

11:00.393 --> 11:02.710
Oh, lewis won't be returning.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.212
He's still in the hospital.

11:04.847 --> 11:08.767
<i>Stanley, meet rex, alan,</i>
<i>and theodore.</i>

Yo, my name is x-ray.

Him, he's mom.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.108
They all have
their little nicknames,

11:17.159 --> 11:20.612
But I prefer
to use the names
their parents gave them,

11:20.663 --> 11:23.448
The names society will
recognize them by.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.951
<i>Theodore, why don't we</i>

<i>'cause there's</i>

<i>His name's not ricky.</i>
<i>It's zigzag, a'ight?</i>

12:06.826 --> 12:09.110
Stanley, if you
have any questions,
just ask theodore.

12:09.912 --> 12:11.496
<i>Theodore will</i>

12:11.547 --> 12:13.047

12:13.082 --> 12:14.416
Yeah, man.
Whatever, dude.

12:14.717 --> 12:16.418
<i>I'm depending on you.</i>

12:16.452 --> 12:19.287
<i>It should be no labor</i>
<i>to be nice</i>
<i>to your neighbor.</i>

12:20.506 --> 12:21.673
Hey, theodore,
is there a place

12:21.724 --> 12:24.058
Where I can fill
my canteen up with water?

12:24.093 --> 12:25.126
<i>I know he smells that.</i>

12:25.144 --> 12:27.628
Yo, my name

12:29.899 --> 12:31.099
It's armpit.

12:32.735 --> 12:34.102
There's a water spigot

12:41.243 --> 12:42.977

12:46.499 --> 12:47.615

13:21.984 --> 13:23.168
No, you can have it.

13:23.202 --> 13:24.819
So, what'd they get you for?

13:24.853 --> 13:26.354
Stealing a pair of shoes.

13:26.372 --> 13:29.574

13:29.625 --> 13:31.159

13:31.193 --> 13:32.794
You just left out
that little detail, right?

13:32.828 --> 13:34.195
They were
clyde livingston's shoes.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.914
<i>X-ray: Sweetfeet? What?</i>

13:35.965 --> 13:38.466
<i>Man, you did not steal</i>

Hold on, hold on.

13:41.870 --> 13:43.555
He's, like, the fastest guy

13:43.589 --> 13:45.557
The guy hit four triples
in one game.

13:47.510 --> 13:49.060
Clyde livingston
donated his shoes

13:49.094 --> 13:50.895
To this, uh, this --
this homeless shelter.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.434
You got zero to talk.

14:00.222 --> 14:01.439
Yeah.

14:19.741 --> 14:21.626
Well, I was an orphan.

14:21.677 --> 14:23.595
I grew up in that home.

14:27.216 --> 14:29.851
I don't understand what

Oh, no. She only kissed

15:39.154 --> 15:40.705

Did you know
that each one's got

25:59.791 --> 26:02.760

28:54.966 --> 28:56.834
There was a town, too.

34:16.987 --> 34:18.155
Pig-stealing
great-great-grandfather.

34:18.206 --> 34:19.255
That's who it is.

34:21.125 --> 34:22.159
No.

34:22.210 --> 34:25.495
You  <i>screwed your life up,</i>
<i>stanley yelnats,</i>

34:25.963 --> 34:27.280
And it's up to you
to fix it.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.299
<i>It's not gonna be easy,</i>

34:29.333 --> 34:31.735
<i>But you'd be surprised</i>
<i>what you can accomplish</i>

34:31.768 --> 34:33.953
Once you set your mind
to it.

34:34.288 --> 34:36.172
<i>Even zero here</i>
<i>isn't completely worthless.</i>

34:37.675 --> 34:39.476
<i>What about you, zero?</i>

34:40.511 --> 34:41.745
What do you like to do?

34:44.681 --> 34:46.550
You just won't talk
with me, will you?

34:46.951 --> 34:48.768
Man, he only talks
to caveman, you know?

34:49.837 --> 34:51.721
You think you're better
than all this?

34:59.530 --> 35:01.398
I like diggin' holes.

35:02.083 --> 35:05.869
Then you're
in the right place
for it, buddy boy.

35:07.538 --> 35:09.122
<i>"my dearest stanley,</i>

35:09.156 --> 35:11.541
<i>"your letters make me feel</i>

35:11.592 --> 35:13.827
<i>Who can afford to send</i>

35:13.845 --> 35:15.212
Do not touch my shoes!

35:15.263 --> 35:17.664
<i>"your father thinks</i>
<i>he's real close</i>

35:17.682 --> 35:20.300
<i>"I do hope so, stanley,</i>

<i>Is threatenin' to evict us</i>

35:22.687 --> 35:24.504
Sir, you are an insult
to the chemistry of smell!

35:24.522 --> 35:26.056
Eight months!
You know what
I'm gonna do with this?

35:26.107 --> 35:28.308
I am going to boil it
with cross-trainers!
Don't do that!

35:28.342 --> 35:30.227
Aah! Aah!
Oh, yeah, "aah!
Aah! Aah! Aah!"

35:32.563 --> 35:36.099
<i>"I feel so sorry</i>

35:42.006 --> 35:43.990
[ chuckles ]
she's crazy.

35:47.862 --> 35:49.296
What are you laughing at?

35:49.330 --> 35:51.030
Uh, just something
my mom wrote.

35:51.716 --> 35:54.251
She, uh [clears throat]
she said...

35:55.586 --> 35:59.172
"I feel sorry
for the little old lady
who lived in the shoe

35:59.206 --> 36:01.057
'cause it must have
smelled really bad."

36:03.427 --> 36:05.812
You know,
like the nursery rhyme.

36:14.105 --> 36:15.272
I -- I feel
really awkward

36:15.323 --> 36:18.542
With you reading over
my shoulder like that,
so...

36:19.360 --> 36:20.827
I can't read.

36:26.951 --> 36:28.585
Can you teach me?

36:31.906 --> 36:33.006
Um...

36:35.343 --> 36:37.427
You know, I'm --
I'm not really a --

36:37.461 --> 36:39.045
A good teacher,

36:39.363 --> 36:43.333
<i>And, uh, I get tired</i>
<i>from digging all day,</i>

36:43.367 --> 36:46.469
So, I just wanna come back
and chill, you know?

36:49.640 --> 36:51.024
Just relax.

36:52.927 --> 36:54.561
<i>See you in there?</i>

37:07.208 --> 37:08.909
Look at this guy.

37:09.276 --> 37:10.000
Whoo!

37:10.000 --> 37:10.377

37:27.011 --> 37:29.629
Hey, look -- a cloud.

37:31.315 --> 37:32.732
Right there.

37:33.517 --> 37:35.134
<i>Maybe it'll move</i>
<i>in front of the sun.</i>

37:35.970 --> 37:37.637
Come on, little cloud.

37:37.655 --> 37:39.189
<i>You can do it.</i>

37:39.607 --> 37:41.691
<i>Please, that's all</i>
<i>I'm asking for</i>

37:41.742 --> 37:43.142
Is just a little shade.

37:44.478 --> 37:46.496
Warden owns
the shade, man.

37:46.981 --> 37:48.531
<i>Maybe we'll get lucky.</i>

37:48.582 --> 37:50.700
Maybe we'll get
some clouds.

37:51.085 --> 37:53.787
<i>It will rain for 40 days</i>
<i>and 40 nights.</i>

37:53.821 --> 37:56.122
<i>Yeah, and we'll have</i>
<i>to build an ark</i>

37:56.156 --> 37:57.374
<i>And get two</i>
<i>of each animal.</i>

37:57.425 --> 37:59.426
Yeah, two scorpions,
two rattlesnakes,

37:59.460 --> 38:01.845
<i>Two yellow spider lizards --</i>
<i>all of that.</i>

38:05.049 --> 38:06.132
Hey.

38:06.851 --> 38:08.718
<i>What do you got there,</i>
<i>caveman?</i>

38:09.353 --> 38:10.520
<i>What?</i>

38:10.554 --> 38:11.855
<i>What do you got there?</i>

38:12.974 --> 38:14.057
<i>I don't know.</i>

38:17.144 --> 38:18.395
Hey, x...

38:19.113 --> 38:21.114
I think I might have
found something.

38:26.654 --> 38:28.354
<i>X-ray: Let me see that.</i>

38:28.372 --> 38:29.706
What do you think?

38:32.460 --> 38:34.995
Looks like an old shotgun
shell or something, man.

38:35.029 --> 38:37.380
No, man, it's too skinny
to be a shotgun shell.

38:37.415 --> 38:38.832
No. No, it's not
a shotgun shell.

38:38.866 --> 38:40.383
Yeah. No, it's not
a shotgun shell.

38:41.385 --> 38:43.219
<i>Look at this.</i>
<i>You see that little heart?</i>

38:43.254 --> 38:45.255
You see that?
With the letters
in it right there?

38:45.306 --> 38:46.539
<i>Yeah.</i>

38:46.557 --> 38:47.841
"k.B." that's what it is.
Let me see.

38:47.875 --> 38:49.476
Let me see it.
K.B.?

38:49.710 --> 38:52.512
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>
<i>That's keith berenger.</i>

38:52.546 --> 38:54.180
<i>Man, who is that?</i>

38:54.214 --> 38:55.231
He was in my math class.

38:56.383 --> 38:57.817
Stupid.
<i>Good thinking, zigzag.</i>

38:57.852 --> 38:59.385
Yeah, it must belong
to him, huh?

38:59.403 --> 39:01.271
<i>Yeah, it must belong</i>
<i>to him.</i>

39:01.322 --> 39:03.740
Well, I'm gonna
go show it to mom.

39:03.774 --> 39:06.109
Maybe I'll get
the rest of the day off.
<i>Rest of the day off?</i>

39:06.160 --> 39:08.061
<i>No. No. Your hole's</i>
<i>already dug.</i>

39:08.079 --> 39:10.413
I-I'm not even close.
I'm gonna be out here
all day.

39:10.664 --> 39:11.915
Yeah? So?

39:14.869 --> 39:18.071
So, uh...
Why don't you, uh,

39:19.239 --> 39:20.707
Why don't you just
turn it in tomorrow?

39:20.741 --> 39:22.542
You know, give it to mom
in the morning?

39:22.576 --> 39:24.010
Then you get
the whole day off.

39:25.046 --> 39:26.579
That's good thinking,
caveman.

39:27.798 --> 39:29.182
I like it.

39:30.084 --> 39:32.085
Pretty smart, caveman.
Pretty smart.

Dr. Pendanski,
drive x-ray back to camp.

41:35.148 --> 41:38.100
Give him double

41:39.019 --> 41:41.153
<i>But first,</i>

41:41.888 --> 41:43.155
I already filled them.

41:44.658 --> 41:45.741
Excuse me?

41:46.226 --> 41:48.361
I had already filled them
when you drove up in the car.

41:48.395 --> 41:49.412
<i>Excuse me?</i>

41:49.446 --> 41:51.747
Did I ask you when
you last filled them?

41:53.784 --> 41:55.201
No. You didn't, but --
<i>excuse me.</i>

41:56.203 --> 41:59.038
Now, these fine boys

Yes, I can hear.

42:49.006 --> 42:50.306
Fill it.

42:50.340 --> 42:52.124
If that's
too much trouble,

<i>Pick every rock now.</i>

43:43.143 --> 43:44.527
<i>Make sure</i>

<i>Warden:</i>
<i>Caveman! Let's go!</i>
<i>¶then I won't want you</i>

43:51.284 --> 43:52.451
Hey, how'd she know
my name, man?

43:52.486 --> 43:54.070
Oh, she's got the whole
place wired.

43:54.121 --> 43:56.372
Oh, yeah, she's got
these little, tiny
microphones and cameras

43:56.406 --> 43:58.124
All over the place.

43:58.158 --> 44:00.025
Yeah, she's got 'em
in the rec room.

44:00.043 --> 44:01.994
She's got 'em
in the tent.

44:02.028 --> 44:03.295
She's got 'em
in the showers.

44:03.330 --> 44:04.413
They're not
in the showers.

44:04.464 --> 44:06.832
Man, don't listen to him.
I read his file.

44:06.866 --> 44:09.385
It says he suffers
from, um, acute paranoia.

44:09.419 --> 44:12.388
Hey, so that means
she watches me
every day, huh?

44:12.422 --> 44:15.891
Man, he says she got
cameras and microphones,

44:15.926 --> 44:17.176
Not microscopes.

44:17.210 --> 44:18.227
[ laughter ]
get outta here, man.

44:38.865 --> 44:41.567
Okay, children, come back
first thing in the morning.

44:41.585 --> 44:43.502
Okay? Rain or shine,
we're gonna have school.

44:43.537 --> 44:44.670
<i>Put your cap on.</i>

44:44.704 --> 44:46.355

Kid 1: Bye, miss katherine.

44:48.091 --> 44:49.741
<i>Kid 2:</i>
<i>See you tomorrow!</i>

44:55.298 --> 44:57.183
Hello, miss katherine.

44:57.717 --> 44:58.917
Hello, sam.

45:00.187 --> 45:02.238
I thought you might
still want some onions.

45:02.556 --> 45:03.606
Thank you.

45:08.178 --> 45:09.528
I can fix that.

45:09.563 --> 45:11.614
<i>Sam, are you gonna</i>
<i>try to tell me now</i>

45:11.648 --> 45:14.450
<i>That your onions are a cure</i>
<i>for a leaky roof?</i>

45:14.484 --> 45:15.601
Naw.

45:15.902 --> 45:17.620
I'm just good
with my hands.

45:18.321 --> 45:20.489
I built my own boat,
you know.

45:20.540 --> 45:22.908
I needed to get across
the lake to my onion field.

45:22.942 --> 45:24.210
<i>Well, then, I guess</i>

45:24.244 --> 45:27.246
You'd be in real trouble
if your boat leaked.

45:27.747 --> 45:30.949
I tell you what --
I'll fix that roof

45:31.468 --> 45:34.403
In exchange for three jars
of your spiced peaches.

45:38.458 --> 45:39.842
It's a deal.

45:53.356 --> 45:54.806
Well, miss katherine,

45:54.824 --> 45:57.409
I guarantee that roof
for five years.

45:58.195 --> 45:59.612
If there's anything else...

46:00.614 --> 46:02.281
[ sighs ]
the windows won't open.

46:02.649 --> 46:05.084
And the children and I would
enjoy a breeze now and then.

46:06.269 --> 46:07.536
I can fix that.

46:07.587 --> 46:11.490
<i>"and this maiden,</i>

46:49.012 --> 46:50.629
Thank you, ma'am.

46:50.664 --> 46:54.216
The d-duck may swim
on the lake,

46:54.501 --> 46:56.335
But my daddy owns the lake.

46:58.221 --> 46:59.338
Tsk.

47:02.092 --> 47:03.892
That will be all
for tonight.

47:03.927 --> 47:05.477
<i>Thank you, class.</i>
<i>You're dismissed.</i>

47:05.895 --> 47:07.429
<i>Come on, boys.</i>

47:08.765 --> 47:09.898
Whew.

47:10.500 --> 47:12.184
Hey, katherine...

47:13.403 --> 47:16.272
How about me and you,
uh, having a little picnic?

47:18.358 --> 47:20.276
Take a ride
on my motorboat.

47:20.327 --> 47:21.727
No, thank you,
mr. Walker.

47:22.162 --> 47:23.362
<i>It's brand-new.</i>

No, thank you.

47:27.584 --> 47:28.917
Uh, come on now, girl.

47:28.952 --> 47:30.068
Hey.

47:30.537 --> 47:32.404
No one ever says no
to trout walker.

47:33.290 --> 47:35.090
I believe I just did.

47:55.595 --> 47:57.896
Got something to do
with it, huh?

47:57.930 --> 48:00.899
Today's the day.
I can feel it.

Glad to have you back,

48:05.989 --> 48:07.573
We can use
your sharp eyes.

48:07.607 --> 48:08.774
Hello, warden.

48:08.792 --> 48:11.076
Ma'am, I think
I found something.

48:15.298 --> 48:16.882
Are you trying
to be funny?

48:16.916 --> 48:18.217
Or do you just think
I'm stupid?

48:21.638 --> 48:23.756
No, ma'am, I-I wasn't
trying to be funny.

48:23.790 --> 48:24.973
Excuse me?

48:25.792 --> 48:27.142
<i>Well, armpit,</i>
<i>your little joke</i>

48:27.177 --> 48:29.311
Just cost you a week
of shower privileges.

48:29.729 --> 48:31.313
All: Aww.

48:31.514 --> 48:33.632
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Everyone back to work.</i>

48:33.650 --> 48:35.934
Man, you sleeping outside.
You heard her --
back to work.

48:35.968 --> 48:38.103
<i>Aside from that,</i>
<i>everything's going</i>
<i>real well.</i>

48:38.137 --> 48:39.938
I don't think so.
I want results.

48:41.524 --> 48:44.360
Sam, this is
the finest schoolhouse
in all of texas.

<i>Four long days.</i>

50:17.120 --> 50:19.872
And this is all
you jackasses got
to show for it.

50:20.239 --> 50:21.573
Probably ain't nothing
down there.

50:21.591 --> 50:23.509
We would have found it
by now.

50:23.877 --> 50:25.627
I wouldn't tell
the queen bee that.

50:26.012 --> 50:27.713
I ain't on stupid pills.

50:28.031 --> 50:29.414

about?

<i>If you can't get 'em</i>

<i>How about that? Huh?</i>

50:35.939 --> 50:37.055
Get to work!

50:37.089 --> 50:39.391
This ain't
no kindergartners

<i>I want to see</i>
<i>some effort here</i>

50:41.478 --> 50:43.195

<i>I ain't just whistling</i>
<i>"bye-bye, sue" neither.</i>

Stop it! Stop it!

50:57.911 --> 50:59.110
Yeah!

51:00.163 --> 51:01.880
Lady, where you going?

51:03.383 --> 51:04.967
<i>Stop it!</i>
<i>[ glass breaking ]</i>

51:05.001 --> 51:06.502

51:11.290 --> 51:12.424
<i>Sheriff!</i>

51:12.458 --> 51:14.059
Sheriff! Come quick!

51:14.093 --> 51:15.794
They're destroying
the school!

51:19.816 --> 51:21.099
Give me a kiss.

51:22.569 --> 51:23.902
You kissed
the onion picker.

51:24.354 --> 51:25.821
You're drunk.

51:26.656 --> 51:28.323
I always get drunk
before a hanging.

51:30.827 --> 51:34.613
If you hang him,
then you better
hang me, too,

51:35.815 --> 51:37.833
Because I kissed him back.

51:38.117 --> 51:40.669
It ain't against the law
for you to kiss him,

51:40.703 --> 51:42.170
Just for him to kiss you.

51:47.493 --> 51:49.428
<i>Man: Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

51:49.796 --> 51:51.162
There she is!

Sam!

52:39.545 --> 52:40.762
Listen up.

52:41.981 --> 52:45.567
After the behavior exhibited
these past several days,

52:46.402 --> 52:48.236
The warden and I
have decided

52:48.271 --> 52:51.273
That your
character-building
be best served

52:51.324 --> 52:54.943
By returning to the digging
of individual holes.

52:57.146 --> 52:58.363
Over to you.

52:58.397 --> 52:59.581
All right!

52:59.616 --> 53:01.450
Let's go dig, boys!

53:02.035 --> 53:04.202
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

53:14.597 --> 53:16.465
Good morning, sheriff.

53:19.418 --> 53:21.386
Do you still want
that kiss?

53:55.805 --> 53:58.724
<i>Water's the most</i>
<i>precious commodity on</i>
<i>the face of the planet.</i>

53:58.758 --> 54:00.509

<i>So think of it</i>
<i>this way --</i>

54:04.514 --> 54:06.297
I'm giving you life.

54:06.649 --> 54:07.766
Say "thank you."

54:07.800 --> 54:09.184
Thank you, mr. Sir.

54:09.235 --> 54:10.352
Next!

54:14.991 --> 54:16.975
Don't get your hopes up.

54:17.443 --> 54:19.310
Them storms never make it
past the mountains.

54:20.196 --> 54:21.747
Maybe this time
they will.

54:22.999 --> 54:25.417
I got a story
for you girl scouts.

54:28.154 --> 54:29.788
Once upon a time,

54:30.540 --> 54:33.709
There was a magical place
where it never rained.

54:35.178 --> 54:36.511
The end.

54:38.264 --> 54:39.431
I don't get it.

54:43.019 --> 54:44.019
Have a nice day.

54:46.505 --> 54:48.273
I never get anything
he says.

54:54.864 --> 54:57.199
Guys. Hey, guys.

54:57.533 --> 54:58.617
What?

54:58.651 --> 55:00.535
Anybody want
some sunflower seeds?

55:00.570 --> 55:01.686
<i>Whoo!</i>

55:03.206 --> 55:05.240
I can't help it, man.
My hands are like magnets.

55:05.291 --> 55:06.575
<i>Good old magnet.</i>

55:06.626 --> 55:08.860
<i>Sticky fingers.</i>

55:08.878 --> 55:09.945
<i>Pass it over here, man.</i>

55:09.979 --> 55:12.047
<i>Yeah, I'll take</i>
<i>some of those. Whoo!</i>

55:12.415 --> 55:14.199
<i>Hey, zig, come on, man.</i>
<i>Hurry up.</i>

55:16.803 --> 55:18.203
Mr. Sir's coming back.

55:18.221 --> 55:19.704
Hey, he's coming back!
He's coming back!

55:19.722 --> 55:20.756
Catch it.

55:20.807 --> 55:22.707
<i>Oh, stanley,</i>
<i>you butterfingers!</i>

55:22.725 --> 55:24.176
<i>Magnet: He's coming back.</i>

55:24.210 --> 55:25.543
<i>You better hide it.</i>

55:25.561 --> 55:27.179
<i>Hide it.</i>

55:27.213 --> 55:28.980
<i>Come on, man.</i>

55:56.259 --> 55:57.626
Well, well.

55:58.511 --> 56:00.128
How did this get here?

56:00.179 --> 56:01.429
What?

56:01.464 --> 56:03.414
<i>How did that get there?</i>

56:04.400 --> 56:06.802
<i>Did it fall</i>
<i>from the sky, huh?</i>

56:07.436 --> 56:08.970
[ sniffles ]
no.

56:19.115 --> 56:20.932
I stole that
out of your truck.

56:20.950 --> 56:24.119
I think maybe the
warden would like to
see what you found.

56:25.371 --> 56:26.488
Let's go.

56:30.193 --> 56:31.243
<i>Y'all having a nice day?</i>

56:31.277 --> 56:32.327
Yes, mr. Sir.

56:32.378 --> 56:33.495
<i>Mr. Sir: Good.</i>

56:33.546 --> 56:35.330
Hey, what are you doing,
dog?

56:35.381 --> 56:37.465
Caveman...
<i>Mr. Sir: See what turns up.</i>

56:42.121 --> 56:43.255
What?

56:43.289 --> 56:46.424
We found a little something
in caveman's hole.

56:46.458 --> 56:48.727
What is it?
What'd you find?

56:48.761 --> 56:49.978
Come in. Come in.

56:50.012 --> 56:51.680
<i>You're letting</i>
<i>the cold out.</i>

56:55.101 --> 56:56.151
<i>Mr. Sir: Tell her.</i>

56:59.405 --> 57:02.691
While mr. Sir was filling
our canteens...

57:04.110 --> 57:05.977
I snuck into his truck

57:06.495 --> 57:09.030
And, uh, stole
his sunflower seeds.

57:09.448 --> 57:10.000
Yeah.

57:10.000 --> 57:10.532
You're Watching 123Movies.to
Yeah.

57:10.532 --> 57:11.667

You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:22.000 --> 57:23.962
In the bureau over there
with my nail polish in it?

57:23.996 --> 57:25.380
Yeah, sure.

57:31.888 --> 57:35.624
<i>Them little diddles</i>
<i>think I don't have eyesad.</i>

57:35.675 --> 57:39.177
<i>But I don't miss much...</i>
<i>As you well know.</i>

57:39.212 --> 57:41.296
<i>You know,</i>
<i>my philosophy is --</i>

57:41.347 --> 57:45.350
See, I keep 'em in line --
punishment and reward.

57:46.585 --> 57:48.853
<i>Punishment...Reward.</i>

57:49.355 --> 57:50.772
<i>Every time</i>
<i>they see me coming,</i>

57:50.806 --> 57:53.608
A little shiver
goes up their spine.

57:53.943 --> 57:56.811
<i>"d" tent -- snaky</i>
<i>little bunch, you know.</i>

57:56.862 --> 57:58.647
<i>They think they're</i>
<i>a step ahead of me,</i>

57:58.698 --> 58:00.765
<i>But I'm miles ahead of them.</i>

58:00.783 --> 58:03.385
<i>I come back at night.</i>
<i>I look around.</i>

58:03.419 --> 58:06.104
I see in their eyes.
They know I know.

58:06.405 --> 58:07.906
<i>Warden: Come right</i>
<i>over here, son.</i>

58:07.940 --> 58:09.824
Here you go.
Thank you.

58:11.711 --> 58:13.378
See this, caveman?

58:15.248 --> 58:17.916
<i>This is my special</i>
<i>nail polish.</i>

58:18.634 --> 58:19.901
<i>I make it myself.</i>

58:20.636 --> 58:23.288
You want to know
my secret ingredient?

58:25.925 --> 58:27.592
Rattlesnake venom.

58:29.645 --> 58:32.463
I just love what it does
to the coloring.

58:34.066 --> 58:36.017
It's perfectly harmless.

58:38.437 --> 58:39.904
When it's dry.

58:44.810 --> 58:47.746
So you think he stole
your sunflower seeds.

58:47.780 --> 58:49.147
No, I don't.

58:49.165 --> 58:52.367
<i>I think he's covering</i>
<i>for x-ray or somebody.</i>

58:52.418 --> 58:53.918
It was a 5-pound sack,

58:53.953 --> 58:55.920
And he claims
to have eaten it all.

58:55.955 --> 58:58.173
But -- but it
was only half full
when I got it.

58:58.207 --> 58:59.457
And, uh, there's a lot
in my hole.

58:59.491 --> 59:00.508
You could check that.

59:00.543 --> 59:02.660
I will.
I will check it.

59:02.678 --> 59:03.995
Aaah-aah!

59:05.848 --> 59:07.015
Ah!

59:07.049 --> 59:08.499
<i>Ah! Ah! Ah!</i>

59:08.968 --> 59:10.885
<i>All I give you is respect</i>
<i>and affection.</i>

59:10.936 --> 59:14.606
<i>I suggest you go back</i>
<i>to your hole now.</i>

59:14.940 --> 59:16.174
Uh! Uh!

59:16.192 --> 59:18.193
<i>Ohh!</i>
<i>Why'd you do that?</i>

59:18.227 --> 59:19.527
<i>Ooh!</i>

59:19.562 --> 59:21.446
I liked you better
when you smoked.

59:21.480 --> 59:22.513
Aah.

59:25.351 --> 59:26.735
Hey, look who showed up.

59:26.786 --> 59:28.953
All right, man, we thought
you were dead for sure.

59:28.988 --> 59:31.022
<i>Hey, caveman,</i>
<i>what'd you say?</i>

59:32.541 --> 59:33.858
Nothing.

59:33.876 --> 59:35.360
What'd she do to you?

59:35.378 --> 59:36.661
Nothing.

59:37.179 --> 59:38.580
Pbbtt. Nothing?

59:38.631 --> 59:40.799
Yeah. She didn't do
nothing.

59:43.369 --> 59:44.369
[ laughing ]
what is this?

59:45.537 --> 59:47.088
Thank you, guys.

59:47.890 --> 59:49.090
Man.

59:49.141 --> 59:50.725
Don't look at us.
Yeah, it was zero.

59:51.877 --> 59:53.762
<i>That boy</i>

<i>But where do them</i>
<i>chinese kids dig to?</i>

59:58.351 --> 01:00:00.185
Man, shut up.

01:00:00.219 --> 01:00:01.436
Hey, zero.

01:00:01.487 --> 01:00:03.355
Why'd you dig my hole, man?

01:00:03.389 --> 01:00:05.073
You didn't steal
the sunflower seeds.

01:00:05.474 --> 01:00:06.775
Yeah, but neither did you.

01:00:09.412 --> 01:00:11.363
You didn't steal
the shoes.

01:00:16.218 --> 01:00:18.520
You still want
to learn to read?

01:00:19.738 --> 01:00:20.789
All right, man.

01:00:26.295 --> 01:00:29.180
<i>Mr. Sir: I don't like no</i>

01:00:29.215 --> 01:00:30.765

stinking onions.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.300
<i>You told me to get onions,</i>
<i>I get onions.</i>

01:00:32.351 --> 01:00:33.518
I want to taste it.

01:00:33.552 --> 01:00:34.719
<i>Go ahead and taste it.</i>
<i>I don't care.</i>

01:00:34.753 --> 01:00:35.804
<i>I'll taste it then.</i>

01:00:35.855 --> 01:00:36.888
<i>Go ahead.</i>

01:00:36.922 --> 01:00:37.939
I'm tasting it.

01:00:37.973 --> 01:00:39.524
Whoa.

01:00:39.558 --> 01:00:41.059
What happened to your face?

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.200
<i>Huh?</i>

01:00:50.286 --> 01:00:52.153
No. No, mr. Sir.

01:00:52.204 --> 01:00:53.938
You got that right.

01:00:59.328 --> 01:01:01.112
Anybody see anything wrong
with my face?

01:01:02.448 --> 01:01:03.498
<i>Huh?!</i>

01:01:03.549 --> 01:01:05.583
I think I'm kind of purty,
don't you?

01:01:05.617 --> 01:01:07.285
Boys: Yes, sir.

01:01:12.975 --> 01:01:14.476
Clean this up.

01:01:18.797 --> 01:01:21.816
<i>I think we just learned</i>
<i>a valuable lesson.</i>

01:01:21.851 --> 01:01:26.404
We're all people, and mr. Sir
is a very sensitive man,

01:01:27.306 --> 01:01:28.473
Just like all of us.

01:02:32.805 --> 01:02:34.722
Remember that gold tube?

01:02:35.374 --> 01:02:36.474
Yeah.

01:02:37.376 --> 01:02:39.511
I think that that tube...

01:02:39.545 --> 01:02:42.880
Was a tube of lipstick,
you know?

01:02:42.898 --> 01:02:46.017
And the "k.B." stands
for kate barlow.

01:02:47.436 --> 01:02:48.719
Kissin' kate barlow?

01:02:50.139 --> 01:02:51.906
Kissin' kate barlow.

01:03:56.338 --> 01:03:57.372
"o."

01:03:57.406 --> 01:03:58.640
That's it.

01:03:59.725 --> 01:04:00.791
I can help you dig your hole

01:04:00.809 --> 01:04:02.727
So you won't be so tired
to teach me.

01:04:02.761 --> 01:04:04.295
No, I'm fine.

01:04:04.313 --> 01:04:06.180
Look --

01:04:06.231 --> 01:04:07.482
<i>Oh ho ho.</i>

01:04:07.516 --> 01:04:08.566

01:04:09.935 --> 01:04:10.968
All right.

01:04:10.986 --> 01:04:12.854
This way, we'll be done

01:04:12.905 --> 01:04:14.105
Well, it couldn't hurt.

01:04:14.139 --> 01:04:15.189
<i>Yeah.</i>

No.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.533
This has to go out
like this.

01:04:25.584 --> 01:04:26.618
That's an "r."

01:04:26.652 --> 01:04:27.669
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

01:04:27.703 --> 01:04:29.704
This one's easy.
"o."

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.957
That's it.

01:04:34.009 --> 01:04:35.760
You know, zero's not
my real name.

01:04:37.496 --> 01:04:38.763
It's not?

01:04:39.264 --> 01:04:40.798
But even pendanski
calls you "zero."

01:04:40.832 --> 01:04:43.434
My name's hector,
hector zeroni.

01:04:44.103 --> 01:04:45.603
Hector zeroni.

01:04:46.004 --> 01:04:47.338
Nice to meet you, hector.

01:04:47.356 --> 01:04:48.473
Nice to meet you.

01:04:49.558 --> 01:04:50.608
<i>Zero: 26 letters.</i>

01:04:50.643 --> 01:04:52.610
<i>So we can do five letters</i>
<i>a day for four days,</i>

01:04:52.645 --> 01:04:54.362
And then six letters
on the fifth day.

01:04:54.396 --> 01:04:55.513
That's good math.

01:04:55.531 --> 01:04:57.949
I'm not stupid.
I know everyone thinks I am.

01:04:57.983 --> 01:05:00.318
I just don't like answering
stupid questions.

01:05:00.352 --> 01:05:01.452
Right.

01:05:01.487 --> 01:05:04.072
Yo, caveman, it must
be kind of easy

01:05:04.123 --> 01:05:07.358
Working with
your own personal
slave and all, huh?

01:05:07.876 --> 01:05:09.544
What's up, stupid?

01:05:10.746 --> 01:05:12.296
Come on, squid.

01:05:13.499 --> 01:05:15.032
Whatever, man.

01:05:18.887 --> 01:05:20.037
<i>Zero: "m"...</i>

01:05:24.042 --> 01:05:25.093
"m."

01:05:31.533 --> 01:05:32.883
We weren't always homeless.

01:05:35.237 --> 01:05:38.723
I remember we
used to live in a
lot of different places.

01:05:39.408 --> 01:05:40.775
And then...

01:05:41.527 --> 01:05:43.494
We didn't live anywhere.

01:05:47.566 --> 01:05:49.250
It must have been hard.

01:05:49.284 --> 01:05:50.418
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:05:50.919 --> 01:05:52.503
My ma had problems,

01:05:52.538 --> 01:05:55.072
But she would try so hard to
make a better life for us.

01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:56.541
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:05:56.575 --> 01:05:59.877
She always used to say,
"I love you more than air."

01:06:00.846 --> 01:06:03.414
She couldn't take me
everywhere she went.

01:06:03.432 --> 01:06:06.934
I used to have to wait like
on a porch or a playground.

01:06:09.138 --> 01:06:10.638
Then one day,
she didn't come back.

01:06:14.926 --> 01:06:16.260
What happened to her?

01:06:20.265 --> 01:06:21.365
I don't know.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.951
That's what bothers me
the most.

01:06:23.986 --> 01:06:25.486
<i>If I could,</i>

01:06:25.537 --> 01:06:27.772
I would hire a whole team
of private investigators

01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:29.574
Just to find her...

01:06:30.092 --> 01:06:32.660
Or to find out
what happened to her.

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:36.714
I used to wait
at laney park.

01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:39.300
Laney park?

01:06:39.334 --> 01:06:40.384
Yeah.

01:06:40.419 --> 01:06:42.286
<i>I used to go to laney park</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

01:06:42.304 --> 01:06:43.421
<i>Oh, really?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:06:43.955 --> 01:06:46.557
I used to sleep in the tunnel
next to the swinging bridge.

01:06:49.178 --> 01:06:50.678
But no biggie.

01:06:54.450 --> 01:06:56.400

You don't want your slave
to be slacking off.

01:07:00.022 --> 01:07:01.572
It's not slavery.
It's an agreement.

Uh, uh, ziggy was beating
up the caveman, right?

Yeah, he's a real genius.

He's so stupid, he doesn't
even know he's stupid.

<i>Okay, from now on,</i>

01:09:48.974 --> 01:09:52.193
I don't want anyone digging

<i>Is that clear?</i>

01:09:53.862 --> 01:09:55.579
And no more reading lessons.

01:09:55.614 --> 01:09:56.864
Why? I mean,
if the hole gets dug,

01:09:56.915 --> 01:09:58.148
Who cares
who's digging it, right?

01:09:58.166 --> 01:10:00.334
You know why
you're digging holes?!

01:10:00.369 --> 01:10:02.370
'cause it's good for you.
It teaches you a lesson.

01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:04.488
If zero digs
your hole for you,

<i>Why can't I still</i>
<i>just dig my hole</i>

And teach him how to read?

01:10:11.263 --> 01:10:12.463

But the mental stress

Just causes his brain too much
of a challenge.

01:10:19.137 --> 01:10:22.723
That's what made
his blood boil,
not the hot sun.

01:10:22.774 --> 01:10:24.358
I'm not digging
any more holes.

01:10:24.393 --> 01:10:25.559
Good.

01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:29.480
I mean, you might as well
teach this shovel to read.

Go ahead, zero.
Take it.

01:10:31.483 --> 01:10:33.951

I was gonna shoot him?

Is there some

might ask questions?

He had nobody.
He was nobody.

I want you to destroy

in the real world, a'ight?

01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:52.961
All right, boss.
Everyone's not
as friendly as us.

01:46:52.996 --> 01:46:54.746
Hold on for me.

01:46:54.797 --> 01:46:56.748
We'll miss you, man!

01:46:56.799 --> 01:46:58.366
All right, guys.
Be good!

01:46:58.384 --> 01:46:59.701
Keep your head up!

Stanley...

01:47:01.888 --> 01:47:04.973
Stanley,
won't you just open it?

01:47:05.008 --> 01:47:07.392
Just let me see
what's inside it, please.

01:47:08.094 --> 01:47:09.211
Excuse me?

01:47:16.069 --> 01:47:17.436
<i>Earl: Have a seat over here.</i>

01:47:20.607 --> 01:47:21.723
"d" tent!

01:47:21.741 --> 01:47:23.058
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:47:23.076 --> 01:47:25.360
<i>If you give up that right,</i>
<i>anything you say can,</i>

01:47:25.394 --> 01:47:27.446
<i>And will, be used against you</i>

01:47:27.497 --> 01:47:29.698
<i>You have the right to be</i>

01:47:29.732 --> 01:47:32.367
<i>If you cannot afford one,</i>

01:47:44.797 --> 01:47:47.099
Okay, one more thing --

01:47:47.133 --> 01:47:49.134
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>We are still family.</i>

01:48:11.574 --> 01:48:12.774
Okay, guys, hold on.
Hold on.

01:48:12.792 --> 01:48:15.610
Before we do anything,
I think that it's only fair

01:48:15.628 --> 01:48:17.329
<i>That half of whatever</i>
<i>is in this box</i>

01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:18.880

01:48:18.915 --> 01:48:21.066
<i>Aw...You want to go halfsies?</i>
<i>Well...</i>

01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:22.584

01:48:22.618 --> 01:48:23.752
Sure did.

01:48:23.786 --> 01:48:25.721
Ha! [ laughs ]

01:48:27.223 --> 01:48:30.225

01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:31.626
Hold on.
Check the date, though.

01:48:35.732 --> 01:48:37.399
<i>What's it worth, honey?</i>

01:48:37.433 --> 01:48:39.768
It's worth a lot more now.
Millions.

01:48:39.802 --> 01:48:41.103
Millions?

01:48:41.137 --> 01:48:42.971
Millions.

01:49:09.015 --> 01:49:10.382
Thank you.

01:49:22.528 --> 01:49:24.446
I love you.

01:49:26.015 --> 01:49:27.616
<i>Stanley iv:</i>

Cursed for
