00:09.725 --> 00:12.239
-Hey, how are you, Doc? The usual?
- Please.

00:12.519 --> 00:15.716
- I'll have my usual too.
- And that would be...?

00:16.898 --> 00:18.968
I come in every day.
You must remember.

00:19.234 --> 00:21.623
My usual is...

00:21.903 --> 00:23.222
a half-caf...

00:24.573 --> 00:26.211
cappuccino...

00:27.492 --> 00:29.847
- with a light dusting of...
- Nutmeg.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.997
- Cinnamon.
- Got it.

00:33.123 --> 00:34.954
God, that's infuriating.

00:35.375 --> 00:38.287
- I come here as often as you do.
- Don't take it to heart.

00:38.587 --> 00:41.579
This person remembers me best.
The next person might...

00:41.882 --> 00:44.316
Oh, my God, you're Frasier Crane!

00:45.218 --> 00:49.291
- Could I bother you for an autograph?
- No, you can't. It's never a bother.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.278
- I love your show.
- Thank you.

00:51.516 --> 00:53.825
I think you're the smartest guy
on Earth.

00:54.102 --> 00:58.061
Well, one does hear tales of a certain
wise man in Tibet, but why split hairs?

00:58.398 --> 01:00.468
- There you are.
- Thanks.

01:01.068 --> 01:02.103
Where was I?

01:02.319 --> 01:05.038
You were last seen hiking up Mount Ego.

01:07.783 --> 01:10.297
Enough.
You've yapped about it all morning.

01:10.577 --> 01:13.614
It's a stupid rule,
and it's foreigners who suffer for it.

01:13.914 --> 01:16.189
Another drive
on the wrong side of the road?

01:16.458 --> 01:17.573
No.

01:18.251 --> 01:21.926
It's about my friend Xena.
You don't want to hear about it.

01:22.673 --> 01:23.822
Hey, Dad.

01:24.049 --> 01:25.607
- Xena. The Greek woman?
- Yes.

01:25.842 --> 01:29.118
We're planning a trip together.
Her mother's taking a cruise,

01:29.429 --> 01:33.217
and her ship will dock in Mazatlan for
a week. She's invited us to join her,

01:33.558 --> 01:36.356
only I can't go because
my bloody passport's expired.

01:36.645 --> 01:39.478
Don't give up hope.
We'll get you across that border.

01:39.773 --> 01:42.412
If I have to,
I'll snuggle you under an old blanket.

01:43.568 --> 01:46.480
- Don't you mean smuggle?
- I'm using code language.

01:46.780 --> 01:48.418
You can't be too careful.

01:49.908 --> 01:51.387
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:51.618 --> 01:53.848
- Ma'am?
- Thanks. I've already ordered.

01:54.121 --> 01:57.033
- Oh, I'm sorry. You had the...
- Absent-minded waiter.

01:57.332 --> 01:59.129
I'll get it myself.

02:03.130 --> 02:07.567
Roz called to remind you about
your meeting with the station manager.

02:07.926 --> 02:11.805
Yes, that. He probably wants to discuss
my 1,000th radio broadcast.

02:12.139 --> 02:14.653
- It's next week.
- You've done a thousand shows?

02:14.933 --> 02:17.845
Yes. If I know the station manager,
he'll want to mark it

02:18.145 --> 02:21.615
with a gaudy celebration:
press, parties, God knows what.

02:21.940 --> 02:25.296
No, I've never gone in
for that self-congratulatory hoopla.

02:25.610 --> 02:28.522
- The work is the thing for me.
- Still, a thousand shows.

02:28.822 --> 02:31.131
- That's quite an achievement.
- I suppose.

02:31.408 --> 02:34.161
- Who'd have thought?
- Not me, that's for damn sure.

02:35.787 --> 02:38.381
Yeah, those first two weeks, p.u.!
Open a window.

02:38.665 --> 02:39.780
All right!

02:43.253 --> 02:45.608
- Hey, morning, Roz.
- Morning, Bulldog.

02:45.881 --> 02:51.080
Oh, my gosh! Look what Frasier
got for me. He's so cute.

02:52.346 --> 02:56.498
"Dear Roz, a huggy bear
for the mom-to-be. Love... Bulldog"?

02:57.768 --> 03:00.840
I guess I shoulda known
you'd think it was from Frasier.

03:01.146 --> 03:02.898
- I'm so sorry, Bulldog.
- It's OK.

03:03.148 --> 03:05.059
I'm not the warmest guy in the world,

03:05.317 --> 03:07.353
but when it comes to kids
I get kinda...

03:07.611 --> 03:10.079
Oh, Bulldog, come here.

03:10.364 --> 03:11.877
Come here.

03:15.786 --> 03:18.175
Whoa, you're gonna make a good mother,
Roz.

03:19.873 --> 03:22.182
Thank you, Bulldog. That's so sweet.

03:26.004 --> 03:27.483
Bulldog?

03:28.340 --> 03:30.774
- Oh, get off me!
- What?

03:31.051 --> 03:33.246
You wanted to hug
because my breasts are bigger!

03:33.512 --> 03:36.470
No, I was just trying
to feel a little kick.

03:37.599 --> 03:39.237
Get out!

03:39.476 --> 03:40.955
Pervert!

03:42.479 --> 03:45.232
Morning, Roz.
I got you one of those muffins you love.

03:45.524 --> 03:47.515
You're not getting a hug!

03:49.277 --> 03:51.871
I see those mood swings
have levelled off nicely.

03:52.781 --> 03:55.090
I'll just go and have that meeting
with Greg.

03:55.367 --> 03:58.484
It's cancelled. He wanted to talk
about your 1,000th show,

03:58.787 --> 04:02.621
- but I ran into him and I handled it.
- All right, let me have it.

04:03.417 --> 04:06.056
What kind of a circus am I in for?

04:06.336 --> 04:08.531
I suppose a garish outdoor rally

04:08.797 --> 04:11.630
like the one they gave for Bob and Nipsy
over at KTLK?

04:11.925 --> 04:15.474
I told him just what you said,
about how the work is its own reward.

04:15.804 --> 04:17.680
So you're off the hook.

04:17.930 --> 04:20.161
- They're not doing anything?
- Nope.

04:21.392 --> 04:24.829
Well, well done, Roz. That's a relief.

04:27.149 --> 04:28.741
Although...

04:30.527 --> 04:33.087
I'm not sure I'm being quite fair
to you, you see.

04:33.363 --> 04:37.515
I did hear that after that rally, Bob
and Nipsy's ratings went up 30 per cent.

04:37.868 --> 04:42.180
The producer got a handsome raise.
And you, with the little one coming...

04:42.539 --> 04:44.973
- Well, it's too late now.
- Right.

04:45.250 --> 04:48.003
Can't be helped.
Best to just leave it alone.

04:48.295 --> 04:49.489
Still...

04:49.713 --> 04:52.102
there is the benefit to the station.

04:52.382 --> 04:54.532
What's good for KACL
is good for all of us.

04:54.801 --> 04:55.790
That's true.

04:56.011 --> 04:58.923
I suppose you could call Greg
and tell him I'd be willing,

04:59.222 --> 05:03.613
for your sake and the station's,
to submit to a small, tasteful,...

05:05.228 --> 05:07.503
low-key public rally.

05:12.319 --> 05:15.152
I just want to renew my passport.

05:15.447 --> 05:18.519
No, I'm a resident alien
here from England.

05:18.825 --> 05:21.498
You know,
the country that used to own you people?

05:22.621 --> 05:24.976
You'll go right to
the head of the line now.

05:26.041 --> 05:27.713
I can't wait two weeks.

05:27.959 --> 05:31.747
My friend Xena's flying down
to meet her mum's ship Sunday.

05:32.506 --> 05:35.896
Don't you put me on hold again!
I'll hang up! I mean it!

05:37.427 --> 05:39.418
I showed him!

05:41.932 --> 05:43.684
Well, it's official.

05:43.934 --> 05:47.404
My 1,000th show is now an event.

05:47.729 --> 05:51.119
- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing short of a media circus

05:51.441 --> 05:53.591
with you-know-who in the centre ring.

05:53.860 --> 05:56.852
They're planning a promotional
blitzkrieg, capped off

05:57.155 --> 06:00.431
by a public rally in my honour
at the foot of the Space Needle.

06:00.742 --> 06:02.937
Wow! That's great!
You must be thrilled.

06:03.203 --> 06:06.434
Of course I'm flattered.
I'm just a little bit embarrassed.

06:06.748 --> 06:09.546
I'd be content with a pat on the back
and an ice cream.

06:11.545 --> 06:14.617
Dad, they've asked if you might say
a few words at the rally.

06:14.923 --> 06:16.959
You don't have to
if you'd be nervous.

06:17.217 --> 06:21.813
Oh, no problem. I can't tell ya how many
retirement dinners I've spoken at.

06:22.180 --> 06:23.898
I've still got my old joke book,

06:24.141 --> 06:27.372
<i>1,001 Side-Splitters, Rib Ticklers
and Thigh-Slappers.</i>

06:28.645 --> 06:32.160
I'm sure you're a veritable
chiropractor of mirth, but...

06:32.482 --> 06:35.997
I think they're looking for
something just a bit more personal.

06:37.237 --> 06:40.786
Hello? All right, Roz, slow down.

06:43.076 --> 06:45.271
Oh, good Lord, the mayor?

06:46.997 --> 06:50.672
Well, has Frasier Fever
swept all the way to City Hall?

06:52.210 --> 06:55.088
Well!
All right, Roz, I'll see you tomorrow.

06:56.715 --> 06:59.832
- The mayor's going to be there?
- Yes. And not just be there,

07:00.135 --> 07:02.569
he's going to present me
with a key to the city.

07:02.846 --> 07:05.963
And he's going to proclaim it
Frasier Crane Day in Seattle.

07:06.266 --> 07:07.415
Way to go, kid!

07:08.018 --> 07:10.407
Who can this be?

07:11.355 --> 07:14.552
Some mechanic from the Vatican
with my Pope Mobile?

07:16.693 --> 07:18.888
- Niles!
- Frasier, dinner's on me.

07:19.154 --> 07:21.190
I got some very good news today.

07:21.448 --> 07:23.803
Your brother
just got some good news, too.

07:24.076 --> 07:27.068
Not so good as mine, I suspect.
First, I have to apologise

07:27.371 --> 07:30.204
for being snippy this morning.
I felt eclipsed lately,

07:30.499 --> 07:32.774
but that vanished
when I reached my office

07:33.043 --> 07:36.831
for what was waiting on my desk
but a gift from the self-esteem fairy.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.942
<i>The American Journal of Psychiatry.</i>

07:43.095 --> 07:46.053
I refer you to the Letters page.
Third one down.

07:47.641 --> 07:51.316
"Dear Sirs, Dr Egmont Sanderling's
recent article on Trichotillomania

07:51.645 --> 07:53.363
contained several errors."

07:53.605 --> 07:56.438
"He should read the ground-breaking work
on the subject

07:56.733 --> 07:59.327
by Dr Alan Caldwell,
Dr Milo Lauderstein..."

07:59.611 --> 08:01.681
Skip to the end.

08:03.532 --> 08:06.171
"...Dr Geraldine Fennelly
and Dr Niles Crane."

08:09.496 --> 08:11.327
Not too shabby, eh?

08:12.374 --> 08:14.046
That's quite an accolade.

08:14.292 --> 08:17.841
Yes, I had no idea you were such
a well-known expert on the...

08:18.171 --> 08:20.082
thing the letter mentioned.

08:21.675 --> 08:24.553
And the way they saved you for last
so you stand out.

08:26.471 --> 08:30.544
Nothing to kick away the clouds like
a heady sip from the goblet of fame.

08:31.601 --> 08:34.592
I told Jean-Claude to start
my victory martini-shaking

08:34.895 --> 08:37.490
- at precisely eight o'clock.
- Off we go then.

08:37.774 --> 08:39.890
You had some news yourself. Do tell.

08:40.152 --> 08:42.985
Well, let's just wait
for that martini, shall we?

08:44.000 --> 08:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:52.873 --> 08:54.591
Happy Frasier Crane Day.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.412
Or is it Merry Frasier Crane Day?
I can never remember.

08:59.838 --> 09:03.387
- Very amusing.
- I'll have a half-caf cappuccino.

09:03.717 --> 09:05.548
Sorry I'm late. I stopped halfway

09:05.802 --> 09:08.874
to listen to a jolly band
of Frasier Crane Day carollers.

09:12.434 --> 09:15.312
I tried to join in on
<i>The Twelve Days of Frasier,</i> but...

09:18.357 --> 09:21.315
forgot the words around day seven.
How does it go again?

09:22.319 --> 09:24.628
I believe it's "seven snobs a-sniping."

09:26.990 --> 09:30.300
Snipe away. I take your jealousy
as the compliment that it is.

09:30.619 --> 09:33.770
A little affectionate joshing
doesn't mean I'm jealous.

09:34.081 --> 09:36.720
- I'm nothing but happy for you.
- Thank you, Niles.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.278
You know, I'm just a touch skittish
today. All this fuss over me.

09:41.630 --> 09:44.622
Say, is it possible
to get these two to go?

09:44.925 --> 09:47.439
We're not due at the Space Needle
for an hour.

09:47.719 --> 09:50.631
I thought a walk might do us good.
Get a little exercise.

09:50.931 --> 09:53.126
Then maybe I can stroll away my jitters.

09:53.392 --> 09:56.031
OK, I could use the fresh air.
I feel a tad sluggish.

09:56.311 --> 09:58.142
- Up late last night?
- I'm afraid so.

09:58.397 --> 10:02.390
As usual, I left it to the last minute
to write all my Frasier Crane Day cards.

10:12.411 --> 10:15.448
What a lovely day.
I'm so glad we decided to walk.

10:15.747 --> 10:18.261
- I feel calmer already.
- Hey, Doc, way to go!

10:19.543 --> 10:20.976
I'm listening!

10:22.004 --> 10:25.280
I just hope Dad doesn't get too nervous
about his speech today.

10:25.590 --> 10:27.740
I've been giving him
little tips all week.

10:28.010 --> 10:30.808
As Daphne tells it,
you wrote the whole thing for him.

10:31.096 --> 10:34.850
I did no such thing! I added a <i>bon mot</i>
or two, tidied up the language,

10:35.183 --> 10:37.174
removed any questionable material.

10:37.436 --> 10:40.473
- Not a word of his left, is there?
- Not a comma.

10:40.772 --> 10:42.171
I'm listening!

10:42.649 --> 10:45.243
Here's a tip.
The ones with cameras are tourists.

10:45.527 --> 10:48.758
They have no idea who you are,
much less why you're listening.

10:49.072 --> 10:51.381
The man clearly waved to me first.

10:51.658 --> 10:53.376
- He didn't wave at you.
- He did.

10:53.618 --> 10:56.086
- He was waving...
- Why are you even objecting?

10:56.371 --> 10:59.329
...for a cab to get away
from the scary "listening" man.

11:01.835 --> 11:07.228
I love this place.
Here you can feel the pulse of the city.

11:08.050 --> 11:11.645
You know what I think when I see all
these people here bustling about?

11:11.970 --> 11:14.279
Low turnout over at Frasier Crane Day?

11:15.641 --> 11:20.192
No. I think that they're the reason
I love this city.

11:22.189 --> 11:24.987
- Stop waving.
- Nothing wrong with being friendly.

11:25.275 --> 11:29.314
There is a difference between friendly
and making a spectacle of yourself.

11:31.740 --> 11:33.935
That man tried to assault me
with a fish!

11:34.201 --> 11:37.398
Niles, get a grip! For God's sake,
you become hysterical

11:37.704 --> 11:39.217
over the littlest things.

11:39.456 --> 11:43.005
My suede shoes. You've spilled latte
over them! They're ruined!

11:43.335 --> 11:46.372
I'm sorry.
And it was a half-caf cappuccino.

11:46.672 --> 11:48.788
Why can no one remember that?

11:49.508 --> 11:52.625
I'll have to replace them.
I'll look foolish otherwise.

11:52.928 --> 11:55.965
Never have I heard such caterwauling
over a pair of shoes.

11:56.264 --> 11:58.778
I spent a bundle on these.
They're Joan and David.

11:59.059 --> 12:01.095
- You named them?
- Oh, shut up!

12:03.105 --> 12:07.018
Well, these are quite handsome,
even if they're just a bit snug.

12:07.776 --> 12:10.449
You can go back.
There's a pair you didn't try on.

12:10.737 --> 12:12.887
Nonsense. We weren't in there that long.

12:13.156 --> 12:17.388
Oh, God, the rally's about to start.
Give me your phone. I'll call Roz.

12:19.579 --> 12:21.456
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

12:24.501 --> 12:26.219
Hello?

12:26.461 --> 12:28.577
Frasier, do you know what time it is?

12:28.839 --> 12:31.637
Where the hell are you?
We're on the air in two minutes!

12:31.925 --> 12:35.315
I'm sorry.
I was involved in a small accident.

12:35.637 --> 12:38.993
I'm fine. Just start without me.
We'll take a cab.

12:39.308 --> 12:42.106
- We'll have better luck at the corner.
- Right.

12:42.394 --> 12:45.670
Niles, wait! Too many fans that way.
I'll be mobbed.

12:45.981 --> 12:49.178
We're better off cutting over one block
through that alley.

12:51.445 --> 12:54.357
Frasier's running late,
I've got to use you first, OK?

12:54.656 --> 12:57.966
Yeah, sure, OK. Geez,
I was hopin' for a little more time.

12:58.285 --> 13:01.197
I haven't even looked at the stuff
Frasier wrote for me.

13:01.496 --> 13:05.091
<i>Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome also to our radio listeners.</i>

13:05.417 --> 13:08.090
<i>I'm Roz Doyle,
and I'd like to thank you all</i>

13:08.378 --> 13:11.688
<i>for helping us congratulate
Dr Frasier Crane.</i>

13:14.426 --> 13:16.064
<i>We've got a full programme...</i>

13:16.303 --> 13:19.420
Stop worrying.
Dr Crane's a very good writer.

13:19.723 --> 13:22.191
Look at this.
I'll die up there with this crap.

13:22.476 --> 13:25.195
<i>Sadly, our guest of honour
has been detained,</i>

13:25.479 --> 13:30.109
<i>but we do have the next best thing,
his dad, Martin Crane.</i>

13:34.905 --> 13:36.133
<i>Thanks, Roz.</i>

13:36.365 --> 13:37.798
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

13:38.700 --> 13:42.170
<i>22 years ago, my son Frasier came to me</i>

13:42.496 --> 13:45.568
<i>and asked if I would put him
through medical school.</i>

13:45.874 --> 13:47.705
<i>I agreed to pay for it,</i>

13:47.959 --> 13:50.837
<i>but remarked,
"I should have my head examined."</i>

13:51.797 --> 13:55.676
<i>Frasier replied, "Give me eight years,
and I'll do it for you."</i>

13:59.680 --> 14:03.912
<i>It was a hard eight years for Frasier,
but as someone once quipped,</i>

14:04.267 --> 14:08.306
<i>"A good psychiatrist never shrinks
from a challenge."</i>

14:14.736 --> 14:16.374
<i>Oh, geez...</i>

14:19.449 --> 14:21.599
For God's sake, Niles,
come out of there.

14:21.868 --> 14:25.463
Our mugger specifically
instructed us to wait for five minutes.

14:25.789 --> 14:29.702
If he'd intended us to time it exactly,
he wouldn't have taken our watches!

14:31.128 --> 14:34.803
All right, calm down. I can see
you're new to this whole mugging thing.

14:35.132 --> 14:38.647
I can't believe I'm missing my own
rally. These shoes are killing me!

14:38.969 --> 14:41.881
They're like the work of a skilled
Chinese footbinder.

14:42.180 --> 14:45.377
Niles, give me your phone.
I'll have Roz send us a car.

14:45.684 --> 14:48.881
What do you think the mugger
reached into my breast pocket for?

14:49.187 --> 14:52.862
The only consolation is he jabbed
himself on my emergency sewing kit.

14:53.191 --> 14:55.227
Niles, a pay phone!

14:56.194 --> 14:59.072
It's not much use to us
unless we can find a quarter.

15:03.327 --> 15:05.795
Niles, look.

15:06.079 --> 15:09.037
You cannot be serious.
You want to rob that poor old man?

15:09.333 --> 15:11.164
- We'll pay him back.
- He's blind.

15:11.418 --> 15:15.252
I know. It's the first break
we've had today. I'll distract him.

15:18.091 --> 15:19.763
Good afternoon!

15:23.889 --> 15:25.686
Sounding lovely.

15:29.019 --> 15:31.453
- Stop! Thief!
- Dear God, run!

15:38.236 --> 15:40.830
<i>I'd like to thank Frasier Crane
for his friendship...</i>

15:41.114 --> 15:43.184
Excuse me, Mayor Rice?

15:43.450 --> 15:45.918
- Yes?
- I have a small bone to pick with you.

15:46.203 --> 15:49.673
I can't say I care for the way your city
treats us poor aliens.

15:49.998 --> 15:51.829
- You're an alien?
- Daphne Moon.

15:52.084 --> 15:54.882
You see, my friend Xena and I...
She's an alien too...

15:55.170 --> 15:58.287
...want to get to Mazatlan
to meet her mother's ship.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.342
- Her mothership?
- Yes.

16:00.592 --> 16:02.822
From what I hear,
it's quite spectacular.

16:03.095 --> 16:05.484
I'm sure it is.
Go with these two gentlemen.

16:05.764 --> 16:08.722
- They can take care of you.
- Well, thank you very much.

16:09.017 --> 16:11.406
- Hello. Do you two work for the mayor?
- Yes.

16:11.687 --> 16:15.202
I suppose I should know that already.
You see, I'm a bit psychic.

16:18.068 --> 16:20.138
Stop, Niles! Stop!

16:20.612 --> 16:23.888
I can't go on any longer.
My feet are killing me.

16:24.199 --> 16:27.555
We lost 'em. Most of them dropped out
after the first corner,

16:27.869 --> 16:30.941
but that short one with the pigtails
was a regular gazelle.

16:32.165 --> 16:36.044
Look, it's even farther away
than it was before.

16:36.378 --> 16:39.814
Frasier, the Monorail!
It goes to the Space Needle.

16:40.132 --> 16:41.724
Let's go!

16:46.263 --> 16:48.652
<i>Welcome to the Seattle Monorail.</i>

16:48.932 --> 16:52.083
- Do you think anyone saw us sneak on?
- I think we're all right.

16:52.394 --> 16:56.148
I hate to say it, but it was sort of
exciting, flouting the law like that.

16:57.399 --> 17:01.233
It gives you some idea of why outlaws
are always such romantic figures.

17:01.570 --> 17:03.561
You might have cut a more dashing figure

17:03.822 --> 17:06.780
had you vaulted the turnstile
and not crawled underneath.

17:07.075 --> 17:10.784
I'm surprised the trains
are even running on Frasier Crane Day.

17:12.998 --> 17:16.991
Yes, well, with any luck we'll still
catch the last 20 minutes of the rally.

17:17.336 --> 17:19.930
Though how I'll explain my lateness,
I have no idea.

17:20.213 --> 17:23.922
I certainly can't tell them
about the fish, the little girls.

17:25.051 --> 17:28.407
I can make something up, I suppose.
Any suggestions?

17:28.722 --> 17:31.282
- The train stopped.
- That's not very original.

17:31.558 --> 17:33.708
No, Frasier, the train stopped.

17:33.977 --> 17:36.366
<i>...people to be open about it.</i>

17:36.647 --> 17:39.400
What's going on?
Excuse me, what's happening?

17:39.691 --> 17:42.159
Electrical problem ahead.
We're going back.

17:42.444 --> 17:44.878
What?
But those people are waiting for me.

17:45.155 --> 17:48.227
- They're so close.
- I guess it just isn't your day.

17:48.533 --> 17:50.091
But it is my day!

17:51.370 --> 17:54.203
- Don't panic, Frasier.
- Oh, don't panic?

17:55.248 --> 17:57.125
Yes, why should I panic?

17:57.376 --> 17:59.970
I'm only missing a celebration
in my own honour,

18:00.253 --> 18:02.130
making me a laughing stock. And why?

18:02.381 --> 18:05.293
- You spilled coffee on my shoes!
- You're blaming me?

18:05.592 --> 18:08.948
If you had the gripping ability every
species above the tree sloth has...

18:09.262 --> 18:12.140
You should think back on the 45 minutes
you and your ego

18:12.432 --> 18:15.822
spent in that shoe store
trying on every pair of shoes!

18:16.144 --> 18:19.500
- Are you calling me vain?
- If the Joan and David fits!

18:30.492 --> 18:32.562
I don't even know
why I'm yelling at you.

18:32.828 --> 18:36.662
I guess I'm just trying to blame you
because I don't want to face the truth.

18:36.999 --> 18:39.069
I'm a big fat phoney.

18:40.919 --> 18:46.198
I wanted my day.
I wanted hoopla and fuss.

18:48.010 --> 18:50.478
I practically planned
the whole thing myself.

18:50.762 --> 18:52.673
- You did?
- Yes.

18:54.016 --> 18:57.008
Says a lot about me as a psychiatrist,
doesn't it?

18:58.895 --> 19:01.250
I'm a small man.

19:01.523 --> 19:05.755
Well, what does it say about me that
I was happy seeing you miss your day?

19:06.486 --> 19:08.397
- You were?
- Of course.

19:08.655 --> 19:12.773
I've been jealous of you all week.
I'm a tiny man.

19:13.368 --> 19:16.883
- Next to me, you're a giant.
- I stare up at your ankles.

19:17.205 --> 19:20.038
- I'd need a stepladder just to...
- Let's not do this.

19:23.170 --> 19:27.766
You shouldn't feel guilty, Frasier.
Everyone deserves a fuss. You above all.

19:28.842 --> 19:32.835
You've helped a lot of people. They
deserve a chance to thank you for it.

19:34.681 --> 19:36.319
Thank you, Niles.

19:41.938 --> 19:45.374
<i>Dr Crane is on his way
and should be here any minute.</i>

19:48.320 --> 19:50.356
There it goes.

19:52.407 --> 19:54.398
Goodbye, fuss.

19:56.828 --> 19:58.261
Goodbye, day.

20:06.046 --> 20:08.640
I hesitate to say this,
but you still have time...

20:08.924 --> 20:11.484
Stop it!
Don't you dare get my hopes up!

20:12.469 --> 20:15.939
That ship has sailed,
that fat lady has...

20:16.264 --> 20:17.822
Taxi! Taxi!

20:19.518 --> 20:24.308
- Oh, damn! I give up.
- Well, I don't. This is your day,

20:24.690 --> 20:27.363
and if I can get you there
for a curtain call, I will.

20:27.651 --> 20:30.449
I still have the blind man's quarter.
I'll call a cab.

20:30.737 --> 20:32.967
Thank you, Niles. You're a good brother.

20:33.240 --> 20:36.994
- Hey! Did I hear you yellin' for a cab?
- Yes!

20:37.327 --> 20:39.636
- I can take you if you want.
- Are you serious?

20:39.913 --> 20:42.381
- Yes.
- Niles! Niles, let's go! Come on!

20:46.628 --> 20:49.381
- What about your friend?
- Oh, he'll be all right.

20:49.673 --> 20:51.345
He's got street smarts.

20:51.591 --> 20:54.389
- Where are we going?
- The Space Needle, please.

20:54.678 --> 20:57.067
No problem.
Should be there in five minutes.

20:57.347 --> 20:59.736
That's the first good news
I've heard all day.

21:00.976 --> 21:03.570
I've been having
a pretty rough day myself.

21:03.854 --> 21:07.847
Yeah. My ex-wife
is getting remarried tomorrow.

21:08.191 --> 21:10.261
In Pennsylvania yet.

21:10.527 --> 21:14.076
- You goin' to that rally over there?
- As a matter of fact, I am.

21:14.406 --> 21:18.524
Told her I'd come to the wedding,
but I've been getting cold feet.

21:19.202 --> 21:23.036
Better make up my mind soon, though.
My plane leaves in a few hours.

21:23.373 --> 21:27.082
They don't give you any bargains
on those last-minute tickets either.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.569
Maybe this isn't the best time
to tell you

21:29.838 --> 21:31.874
but I'll have to owe you for this ride.

21:34.217 --> 21:36.048
Don't worry about it.

21:37.929 --> 21:41.205
Probably never should have gotten
married in the first place.

21:41.516 --> 21:44.428
We were young.
Had a few good years, though.

21:44.728 --> 21:47.037
Well, that's something, at least.

21:48.023 --> 21:50.173
At least the kids
will be there tomorrow.

21:50.442 --> 21:53.240
- Kids?
- Son and a daughter.

21:54.154 --> 21:57.510
I don't see 'em much. They went
with their mom when we divorced.

21:59.284 --> 22:02.356
Of course, I think I'm more excited
about seein' them

22:02.663 --> 22:06.212
- than they are about seein' me.
- Why would you say that?

22:07.626 --> 22:09.139
Just a feeling.

22:09.378 --> 22:12.814
I didn't make much of my life back
when Marie and I were together.

22:13.715 --> 22:16.627
Turned it around, though.
I own this car.

22:16.927 --> 22:20.317
Well, it's a nice one.

22:22.182 --> 22:26.778
The hardest part is, if I do go,
I have to see my in-laws.

22:27.145 --> 22:29.864
They were never too crazy about me.

22:30.148 --> 22:33.823
This new guy Marie is marrying is
supposed to be some kind of big success.

22:34.152 --> 22:36.268
I don't know what I'd say
to any of them.

22:36.530 --> 22:40.284
Part of me thinks I'd just be better off
leaving the whole thing alone.

22:41.243 --> 22:44.758
- And part of you doesn't.
- I'd like to see my kids.

22:46.331 --> 22:48.845
Especially now
they're getting a new dad.

22:49.584 --> 22:51.461
Hell of a choice, huh?

22:51.712 --> 22:55.944
You know, sometimes difficult choices
like these can be good things.

22:57.801 --> 23:00.361
They can teach us about who we are.

23:08.645 --> 23:11.159
I've bent your ear enough about this.

23:12.107 --> 23:13.825
Besides, we're here.

23:14.067 --> 23:16.900
Oh, don't worry about me.
I've got plenty of time.

23:17.195 --> 23:21.029
- Tell me more about your kids.
- All right.

23:23.327 --> 23:26.364
- I'm John, by the way.
- I'm Frasier.

24:02.574 --> 24:04.371
So long, Seattle, we love you!
