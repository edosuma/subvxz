WEBVTT

00:02.121 --> 00:04.689
And the next wedding gift is...

00:04.689 --> 00:06.056
a gravy boat.

00:06.058 --> 00:08.023
Ooh, one gravy boat.

00:08.025 --> 00:09.157
That's from Sheldon.

00:09.159 --> 00:10.558
He told me he had it engraved.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.493
"In the event of a divorce,

00:12.495 --> 00:15.061
please return
to Sheldon Cooper."

00:15.063 --> 00:19.230
One "inappropriate,

00:19.232 --> 00:22.266
yet I wish I thought
of that" gravy boat.

00:22.268 --> 00:23.766
When I get married
I'm going to register

00:23.768 --> 00:25.367
at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.

00:25.369 --> 00:27.436
Ew, why?

00:27.438 --> 00:29.271
'Cause I've always wanted
a whole human skeleton

00:29.273 --> 00:31.606
and they are really spendy.

00:33.041 --> 00:35.509
So, you actually see you and
Sheldon getting married someday?

00:35.511 --> 00:37.244
Not just someday.

00:37.246 --> 00:38.545
In exactly four years.

00:38.547 --> 00:40.012
But don't tell Sheldon.

00:40.014 --> 00:41.247
He's still a flight risk.

00:42.448 --> 00:44.582
What about you, Penny?

00:44.584 --> 00:46.150
What about me what?

00:46.152 --> 00:48.785
Do you think you and Leonard
might ever get married?

00:49.920 --> 00:52.488
Oh, well, you know,

00:52.490 --> 00:56.090
Leonard is great.

00:56.092 --> 00:58.059
But do you think
you'll ever get married?

00:58.061 --> 00:59.793
He's a sweetie.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.428
You're not answering
the question.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.362
Do you love him?

01:03.364 --> 01:06.031
Yeah, sure, of course
I love him.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.199
It doesn't sound like it.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.766
Well, I do.

01:09.801 --> 01:10.901
Do you tell him that?

01:10.903 --> 01:14.036
No, he'd just take it
the wrong way.

01:14.038 --> 01:15.304
What does that mean?

01:15.306 --> 01:19.339
It means he is special
and smart and nice and...

01:19.341 --> 01:20.307
Are you gonna break up with him?

01:20.309 --> 01:21.174
No!

01:21.176 --> 01:23.309
Maybe. I don't know.

01:23.311 --> 01:25.310
I had no idea you were unhappy.

01:25.312 --> 01:26.811
That's the thing: I'm not.

01:26.813 --> 01:28.912
I'm not unhappy at all.
It's just... I don't know...

01:28.914 --> 01:31.781
I-I've been in love before,
but it felt different.

01:33.316 --> 01:36.818
But maybe this is a new,
better, boring kind of love.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.787
Do you ever feel that way
about Howard?

01:39.789 --> 01:41.889
Oh, that's not really
a fair comparison.

01:41.891 --> 01:45.025
I'm basically married
to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.

01:46.327 --> 01:47.794
Amy, you?

01:47.796 --> 01:49.296
Can't help ya, kid.

01:49.298 --> 01:52.298
Whenever I'm around Sheldon, I
feel like my loins are on fire.

01:53.333 --> 01:54.467
In the good way.

01:54.469 --> 01:56.935
Not the urinary tract
infection way.

02:31.342 --> 02:32.942
You don't have to shout, Raj.

02:32.944 --> 02:36.679
It's not like I'm an astronaut
floating around in outer space.

02:36.681 --> 02:39.516
Oh, wait, I am.

02:42.619 --> 02:45.388
So, is it everything
you hoped it would be?

02:45.390 --> 02:46.689
It's better.

02:46.691 --> 02:50.694
I wake up every morning
and I just can't believe

02:50.696 --> 02:53.096
I'm on this
incredible adventure.

02:53.098 --> 02:54.164
Hey, Froot Loops,

02:54.166 --> 02:56.967
did you clean the space toilet?

02:58.136 --> 03:01.571
Excuse me.
I'm talking to my friends.

03:01.573 --> 03:04.975
You know the rules:
new guy scrubs the toilet.

03:06.377 --> 03:10.213
If you do good job,
next time we give you brush.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.452
Funny.

03:15.454 --> 03:16.486
We're always

03:16.488 --> 03:18.788
giving each other
a hard time up here.

03:18.790 --> 03:20.456
It's kind of like
being in a frat.

03:20.458 --> 03:25.194
You know, joking, kidding
around, hurting feelings.

03:25.196 --> 03:26.262
Okay, my turn.

03:26.264 --> 03:27.896
Let me talk to him.
Go ahead.

03:27.898 --> 03:29.798
2311 North Los Robles Avenue,

03:29.800 --> 03:33.235
Pasadena, California
to International Space Station.

03:33.237 --> 03:34.904
Can you read me? Over.

03:36.540 --> 03:39.208
Yes, I read you, Sheldon.

03:39.210 --> 03:40.576
Copy that. Over.

03:40.578 --> 03:42.612
What are you doing?

03:42.614 --> 03:44.780
I am talking to a man in space.

03:44.782 --> 03:46.282
If you don't have the
(walkie-talkie static)

03:46.284 --> 03:48.684
then he might as well be at the
Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.

03:49.953 --> 03:52.120
You're out of your mind,
Sheldon.

03:52.122 --> 03:54.790
That's a negative.
My mother had me tested. Over.

03:56.460 --> 03:57.926
Come on, scrub it up, Loops.

03:57.928 --> 04:00.695
All right, all right.

04:00.697 --> 04:01.996
I gotta go.

04:01.998 --> 04:04.565
There's a meteor shower.

04:04.567 --> 04:06.267
You want to see a meteor shower?

04:06.269 --> 04:09.303
Take a look at what Dimitri
just left you in the toilet.

04:13.642 --> 04:15.410
Bye.

04:15.412 --> 04:17.745
Over and out.

04:17.747 --> 04:19.480
Bye, buddy!

04:20.716 --> 04:21.783
Hello.

04:21.785 --> 04:23.151
Hey, Stuart, come on in.

04:23.153 --> 04:24.352
What are you doing here?

04:24.354 --> 04:27.722
Um, Raj invited me to go
to the movies with you guys.

04:27.724 --> 04:29.925
Excuse me.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.962
I didn't authorize this.

04:34.164 --> 04:36.099
Sheldon, you are not in charge.

04:36.101 --> 04:37.701
That's mighty sassy for a man

04:37.703 --> 04:39.970
with a roommate performance
review around the corner.

04:41.306 --> 04:42.539
What's the big deal?

04:42.541 --> 04:44.141
You guys are bringing
your girlfriends.

04:44.143 --> 04:45.375
I didn't want to sit by myself.

04:45.377 --> 04:47.845
The big deal is
I was expecting us

04:47.847 --> 04:49.747
to be an intimate group of five.

04:49.749 --> 04:50.914
Now, we're going to be a...

04:50.916 --> 04:53.117
faceless mass of six.

04:54.686 --> 04:57.087
It'll be fine.
Just, uh, pretend he's Wolowitz.

04:57.789 --> 04:59.023
Hmm.

05:01.460 --> 05:03.795
Do you like Raisinets?

05:03.797 --> 05:05.263
I can take them or leave them.

05:05.265 --> 05:07.498
At the movies, Wolowitz
always eats Raisinets.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.235
Would you feel more comfortable
if I ate Raisinets?

05:10.237 --> 05:13.472
Well, it's hardly my business
what you eat,

05:13.474 --> 05:14.974
as long as it doesn't crunch
during the film

05:14.976 --> 05:16.342
and it's Raisinets.

05:17.978 --> 05:19.245
Okay.

05:19.247 --> 05:20.212
Should we go?

05:20.214 --> 05:21.547
Yeah, but, one more question.

05:21.549 --> 05:22.582
If you're going
to replace Wolowitz,

05:22.584 --> 05:23.616
I need to know
a little more about you.

05:23.618 --> 05:24.617
All right.

05:24.619 --> 05:26.519
Wolowitz went to MIT.

05:26.521 --> 05:28.187
What's your educational
background?

05:28.189 --> 05:29.855
I went to art school.

05:29.857 --> 05:31.290
Equally ridiculous. Let's go.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:53.482 --> 05:57.619
This insistence on hand-holding
is preposterous.

05:57.621 --> 05:58.754
Well, I like it.

05:58.756 --> 05:59.755
Yeah, of course you do.

05:59.757 --> 06:01.424
You're a girl.

06:01.426 --> 06:04.594
You like all kinds
of hippy-dippy things.

06:04.596 --> 06:07.264
Just watch the movie.

06:08.533 --> 06:10.767
It's not fair.

06:10.769 --> 06:13.637
Penny isn't making Leonard
hold hands.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.873
There might
be a reason for that.

06:16.875 --> 06:20.177
Sweaty?

06:20.179 --> 06:21.545
Unhygienic?

06:21.547 --> 06:22.880
Looks dumb?

06:22.882 --> 06:24.381
Take your pick.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.817
Penny said she's not sure

06:26.819 --> 06:28.718
she wants to be Leonard's
girlfriend anymore.

06:31.722 --> 06:36.491
Wrong. She just took a sip
from his Diet Dr. Pepper.

06:36.493 --> 06:37.693
So?

06:37.695 --> 06:40.896
So, if she wants to end
her pair-bond with Leonard,

06:40.898 --> 06:42.831
why on earth would she guzzle
a witches' brew

06:42.833 --> 06:45.234
of his soda and spit?

06:45.236 --> 06:48.070
It's complicated.

06:48.072 --> 06:51.506
String theory is complicated.

06:51.508 --> 06:53.275
That's just yucky.

06:56.213 --> 06:58.481
Don't get any ideas.

07:02.119 --> 07:04.754
All right, for the sake of
argument, let's say that's true.

07:04.756 --> 07:06.889
Why doesn't Penny
just end the relationship?

07:06.891 --> 07:08.692
She's not sure how she feels.

07:08.694 --> 07:12.062
How can she not be sure
how she feels?

07:12.064 --> 07:15.332
You know, when I have
a feeling, I know it.

07:15.334 --> 07:18.368
Trains? Love them.

07:18.370 --> 07:20.571
Swordfish?
I love them, too.

07:20.573 --> 07:24.241
They're fish with a sword
for a nose.

07:26.945 --> 07:29.280
Regardless, don't say anything
to Leonard.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.316
Now you're asking me
to keep a secret

07:32.318 --> 07:34.518
from my best friend,
colleague, and roommate?

07:34.520 --> 07:36.587
Yes, please, Penny will kill me.

07:36.589 --> 07:39.556
Fine.

07:39.558 --> 07:41.158
FYI: secret-keeping?

07:41.160 --> 07:43.661
Hate it.

07:43.663 --> 07:47.064
Hand-holding?
Not a fan.

07:47.066 --> 07:50.334
Hammerhead shark?
I love that thing.

07:50.336 --> 07:53.471
Yeah, it's another fish
with a tool on its head.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.873
Raisinet?

07:55.875 --> 07:58.676
Shh, we're trying
to watch the movie.

08:00.746 --> 08:04.983
This is not working out
with him.

08:18.397 --> 08:19.698
What are you doing?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.500
I think I might
have tartar buildup.

08:24.437 --> 08:28.373
My tongue won't go as far
forward as it used to.

08:28.375 --> 08:31.409
Maybe your tongue is shrinking.

08:38.015 --> 08:39.249
Nope.

08:44.522 --> 08:46.957
Oh, you have no idea
how annoying this is.

08:46.959 --> 08:50.861
I'm starting
to get a sense of it.

08:52.097 --> 08:54.999
Don't worry. I'll take you
to the dentist tomorrow.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.867
Thank you.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.002
I appreciate that.

08:59.004 --> 09:00.704
You're good people, Leonard.

09:09.380 --> 09:10.780
There's something
I need to tell you.

09:10.782 --> 09:12.248
Okay.

09:14.317 --> 09:16.118
I can't tell you.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.388
Why?

09:18.390 --> 09:21.858
I can't tell you
why I can't tell you.

09:22.893 --> 09:26.496
So I guess there's two things
I can't tell you.

09:26.498 --> 09:28.899
I wish there were more.

09:28.901 --> 09:32.668
Good night.

09:38.141 --> 09:39.175
I'm sorry.

09:39.177 --> 09:40.643
This is really important.

09:40.645 --> 09:42.211
What is it?

09:43.815 --> 09:46.782
I like The Transformers.

09:48.251 --> 09:51.587
Do you like The Transformers?

09:51.589 --> 09:55.291
Where exactly did your mother
have you tested?

09:55.293 --> 09:57.726
Leonard,

09:57.728 --> 09:59.561
The Transformers teach us

09:59.563 --> 10:02.965
that things are not always
what they appear to be.

10:02.967 --> 10:04.433
You know, like, uh,

10:04.435 --> 10:08.269
a semi truck might
be an alien robot,

10:08.271 --> 10:13.142
or, uh, someone in a romantic
relationship, uh, might feel

10:13.144 --> 10:14.910
differently than they appear to.

10:14.912 --> 10:17.546
Or a conversation

10:17.548 --> 10:20.316
about The Transformers
might actually be

10:20.318 --> 10:22.719
about someone in this room.

10:28.326 --> 10:31.595
I'm going to pause
to let that sink in.

10:33.432 --> 10:34.465
Okay, I think I understand.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.700
You do?

10:35.702 --> 10:40.505
The guy who seems like
an emotionless robot is you...

10:42.308 --> 10:46.944
but your relationship with Amy
is causing you to transform

10:46.946 --> 10:51.315
into a red-blooded man
with sexual desires.

10:54.419 --> 10:58.589
That is literally the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

11:09.700 --> 11:10.999
Leonard?

11:11.001 --> 11:12.334
Leonard.

11:12.336 --> 11:14.102
Leonard?

11:14.104 --> 11:15.569
What?

11:15.571 --> 11:17.705
Are you sleeping?

11:17.707 --> 11:19.840
I was. Now I'm having
a nightmare.

11:22.410 --> 11:23.610
What do you want?

11:26.079 --> 11:28.615
Never mind.
I still can't tell you.

11:31.085 --> 11:32.518
Penny?

11:32.520 --> 11:34.787
Mmm.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.193
Penny.

11:41.195 --> 11:44.296
Mm-hmm, mmm.

11:44.298 --> 11:45.664
Penny.

11:49.569 --> 11:50.736
Oh, my God.

11:50.738 --> 11:51.570
Sheldon?

11:51.572 --> 11:53.972
You frightened me.

11:57.343 --> 11:59.645
What are you doing
in my bedroom?

11:59.647 --> 12:01.146
Yeah, well, I knocked
on the front door,

12:01.148 --> 12:02.113
but you didn't hear it.

12:02.115 --> 12:04.149
How did you even get in,
you weirdo?

12:04.151 --> 12:05.784
Yeah, really?

12:05.786 --> 12:08.219
I've seen strange men traipsing
in and out of here for years,

12:08.221 --> 12:10.388
but when I do it, it's weird?

12:11.690 --> 12:12.823
What do you want, Sheldon?

12:12.825 --> 12:15.426
Oh, I was having a
little trouble sleeping

12:15.428 --> 12:16.560
and I just thought,

12:16.562 --> 12:19.764
uh, seeing as you're up,
we could talk.

12:20.966 --> 12:22.033
Talk about what?

12:22.035 --> 12:23.267
Oh, I don't know.

12:23.269 --> 12:27.371
Uh, weather, uh, fish
you could do carpentry with.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.108
Why Leonard is such
an attractive

12:30.110 --> 12:31.643
and desirable boyfriend.

12:31.645 --> 12:33.779
Yeah, pick one-- your choice.

12:33.781 --> 12:35.414
Sheldon.

12:35.416 --> 12:37.917
Did you know that Leonard
has a perfect driving record

12:37.919 --> 12:40.419
and enjoys
the insurance discounts

12:40.421 --> 12:41.520
that go along with that?

12:41.522 --> 12:43.989
Hubba-hubba.

12:43.991 --> 12:47.192
Okay, go home, crazy man.

12:47.194 --> 12:49.428
Yeah. Did you know that

12:49.430 --> 12:52.264
while Leonard is not considered
a tall fellow in our country,

12:52.266 --> 12:55.134
in today's North Korea,
he's downright average.

12:56.336 --> 12:58.470
Talk about a keeper.

13:00.006 --> 13:01.373
Okay, what did Amy tell you?

13:01.375 --> 13:02.908
Oh, very well.

13:02.910 --> 13:04.977
I can't keep up
this clever charade any longer.

13:04.979 --> 13:07.579
She told me

13:07.581 --> 13:09.614
that you were thinking
of ending it with Leonard.

13:09.616 --> 13:12.383
Okay, you listen to me.

13:12.385 --> 13:14.953
I think it's really sweet you're
trying to protect your friend,

13:14.955 --> 13:16.487
but this is none
of your business. Got it?

13:16.489 --> 13:20.524
Excuse me. This is not
about protecting my friend.

13:25.163 --> 13:28.333
I'm a big fan of homeostasis.

13:28.335 --> 13:29.434
Do you know what that is?

13:29.436 --> 13:31.970
Of course not.
Yeah.

13:31.972 --> 13:36.008
Homeostasis refers
to a system's ability

13:36.010 --> 13:37.876
to regulate
its internal environment

13:37.878 --> 13:40.746
and maintain a constant
condition of properties

13:40.748 --> 13:42.948
like temperature or pH.

13:42.950 --> 13:46.385
Worst bedtime story ever.

13:46.387 --> 13:49.989
My point is

13:49.991 --> 13:51.824
I don't like when things change.

13:51.826 --> 13:53.792
So, regardless of your feelings,

13:53.794 --> 13:56.161
I would like you
to continue dating Leonard.

13:57.197 --> 13:58.664
And also,

13:58.666 --> 14:01.534
while we're on the subject, you
recently changed your shampoo.

14:01.536 --> 14:04.003
I'm not comfortable
with the new scent.

14:05.238 --> 14:07.539
Please stop this madness
and go back to green apple.

14:09.543 --> 14:11.777
Okay, honey, I have
a lot to figure out,

14:11.779 --> 14:15.281
and until I do, you are not
to say a word to Leonard.

14:15.283 --> 14:16.516
Do you understand?

14:16.518 --> 14:17.885
I do.

14:17.887 --> 14:19.619
You clear
on the shampoo issue?

14:19.621 --> 14:21.054
Get out.

14:25.794 --> 14:26.826
Penny?

14:26.828 --> 14:27.927
What?

14:27.929 --> 14:30.897
Please don't hurt my friend.

14:32.266 --> 14:34.267
That is the last thing
I want to do.

14:34.269 --> 14:35.235
Thank you.

14:38.106 --> 14:39.372
Coconut? What were you thinking?

14:39.374 --> 14:40.407
Are you a hula girl?

14:40.409 --> 14:42.643
Get out!

14:49.618 --> 14:52.053
Hello?

14:52.055 --> 14:54.023
What the hell is wrong with you?
You told Sheldon?

14:54.025 --> 14:55.892
Do you know what a terrible
position this puts me in?

14:57.295 --> 14:58.495
Hang on, please.

15:00.464 --> 15:01.464
Hello?

15:01.466 --> 15:03.166
Yeah, just a heads-up:

15:03.168 --> 15:05.268
Penny knows that you blabbed
about Leonard.

15:05.270 --> 15:06.971
She's pretty mad.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.040
I know.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.976
She's yelling at me right now.

15:10.978 --> 15:15.081
All right then,
so we're all on the same page.

15:15.083 --> 15:17.951
Yeah.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.088
Hey, Bernie.

15:21.090 --> 15:22.289
There's my hubby.

15:22.291 --> 15:23.758
How's everything going up there?

15:23.760 --> 15:25.559
Oh, it's okay.

15:25.561 --> 15:27.895
Space is beautiful.

15:27.897 --> 15:31.765
Earth is beautiful.
Same old, same old.

15:31.767 --> 15:33.299
What's wrong?

15:33.301 --> 15:34.334
Nothing.

15:34.336 --> 15:35.868
Everything's fine.

15:35.870 --> 15:37.036
Howard.

15:39.707 --> 15:42.909
The other astronauts
are being mean to me.

15:45.546 --> 15:47.047
No, what are they doing?

15:47.049 --> 15:50.117
Well, like for instance, the
other day when I was asleep,

15:50.119 --> 15:53.720
one of the guys went
on a space walk and glued

15:53.722 --> 15:58.692
a big-eyed rubber alien mask
to the outside of my window.

16:00.128 --> 16:03.063
When I woke up, I screamed
for like nine minutes.

16:03.065 --> 16:05.165
Oh, Howie.

16:05.167 --> 16:07.534
You can see it if you want.
It's on YouTube.

16:07.536 --> 16:11.705
Google "astronaut screams
for nine minutes."

16:11.707 --> 16:14.008
Why don't you stand up to them?

16:14.010 --> 16:16.344
What am I supposed to say?

16:16.346 --> 16:18.513
I don't know.

16:18.515 --> 16:21.116
Say, "Being mean is lame.

16:21.118 --> 16:24.686
What's cool is being nice."

16:29.959 --> 16:32.895
Great, I'll do that when
I want to be the first guy

16:32.897 --> 16:35.864
in space to get a wedgie.

16:35.866 --> 16:38.600
Do you want me
to call somebody at NASA?

16:38.602 --> 16:40.302
No.

16:40.304 --> 16:41.770
My mom already tried that.

16:41.772 --> 16:44.573
It only made things worse.

16:45.741 --> 16:48.209
Gelatinous Sphere.

16:48.211 --> 16:50.911
Focused Locust.

16:50.913 --> 16:54.181
Temple of Yip.

16:54.183 --> 16:57.084
I'm sorry. Wolowitz
would never play that card.

16:57.919 --> 17:01.988
All right,
Lesser Demon Turtle.

17:01.990 --> 17:04.891
Fairy God Monster, I win.

17:04.893 --> 17:08.395
Your desperate need
for friendship makes you weak.

17:10.698 --> 17:12.031
So, what are you
guys doing later?

17:12.034 --> 17:14.501
Stuart and I were thinking
of going out for a drink.

17:14.502 --> 17:15.903
We're gonna try
to meet some girls.

17:15.905 --> 17:17.738
'Cause that's what we do.

17:19.473 --> 17:20.608
Watch out, ladies:

17:20.609 --> 17:25.079
a little coffee and cream
coming your way.

17:26.048 --> 17:29.717
In case you didn't follow that,
I'm the coffee.

17:30.319 --> 17:31.486
Leonard?

17:31.488 --> 17:34.255
Maybe you'd like to go
with them to meet girls.

17:34.257 --> 17:36.525
Why would I be interested?
I have Penny.

17:36.527 --> 17:39.328
Yeah, for now.

17:40.263 --> 17:42.564
But that woman has
a death wish, Leonard.

17:42.566 --> 17:46.335
She talks to strangers;
she pets unfamiliar dogs;

17:46.337 --> 17:47.736
and it is ridiculously easy

17:47.738 --> 17:51.306
to break
into her apartment.

17:51.308 --> 17:53.108
If I were you,

17:53.110 --> 17:54.309
I'd get a back-up.

17:54.311 --> 17:56.845
You can't just replace
someone you care about

17:56.847 --> 17:58.747
with some other random person.

17:58.749 --> 18:02.250
No, please don't ruin this
for me.

18:03.586 --> 18:06.188
Do you remember
how upset I was

18:06.190 --> 18:08.890
when they replaced Edward Norton
as the Hulk?

18:08.892 --> 18:11.760
Yes, you walked around
for a week saying,

18:11.762 --> 18:14.763
"Sheldon unhappy
with casting choice."

18:15.998 --> 18:19.968
But, then Mark Ruffalo
was the Hulk in <i>The Avengers,</i>

18:19.970 --> 18:21.669
and he was even better.

18:21.671 --> 18:22.670
What's your point?

18:22.672 --> 18:24.139
Call me a romantic.

18:24.141 --> 18:25.874
I like to think

18:25.876 --> 18:29.711
that your Mark Ruffalo
is still out there somewhere.

18:31.180 --> 18:33.248
This is ridiculous.
Are we gonna play cards or not?

18:33.250 --> 18:35.517
I like Mark Ruffalo, too.

18:35.519 --> 18:39.053
Yeah, settle down there,
Fake Wolowitz.

18:39.055 --> 18:42.157
No one likes a kiss-up.

18:44.627 --> 18:47.796
So, I had to take Sheldon
to the dentist this morning.

18:47.798 --> 18:49.697
Really?
Yup.

18:49.699 --> 18:51.433
I told him if he didn't
bite the hygienist,

18:51.435 --> 18:53.968
I'd take him for ice cream.

18:53.970 --> 18:55.236
Mmm.

18:55.238 --> 18:58.574
I didn't have to take him
for ice cream.

18:58.576 --> 19:00.209
Uh-huh.

19:00.211 --> 19:01.377
You okay?

19:01.379 --> 19:02.578
You seem a little distracted.

19:04.981 --> 19:09.084
Look, there's something
I need to tell you.

19:09.086 --> 19:10.351
Oh.

19:10.353 --> 19:11.419
Yeah, okay.

19:11.421 --> 19:13.255
I don't really know
how to say this.

19:13.257 --> 19:14.356
Just say it.

19:14.358 --> 19:17.058
Okay. Here goes.

19:17.060 --> 19:18.826
Mm-hmm.

19:25.134 --> 19:27.735
You slept with him?

19:27.737 --> 19:29.404
I didn't know what else to do.

19:29.406 --> 19:31.773
He had those big, sad eyes.

19:31.775 --> 19:35.610
Oh, sure, you had no choice.

19:38.146 --> 19:39.947
He looked at me like this.

19:43.552 --> 19:44.752
Well, if that's all it takes,

19:44.754 --> 19:46.220
it's a good thing
you don't have a dog.

19:49.358 --> 19:51.726
Don't worry.

19:51.728 --> 19:53.728
You'll have plenty of chances
to break up with him:

19:53.730 --> 19:55.397
Your wedding day,
your honeymoon,

19:55.399 --> 19:57.900
your 50th anniversary.

19:57.902 --> 19:58.968
Look, it's fine.

19:58.970 --> 20:00.669
We're not getting married, okay?

20:00.671 --> 20:04.907
We're keeping things,
you know, homeostasis.

20:06.576 --> 20:10.112
It's so cute
when she tries.

20:13.851 --> 20:15.885
It's from Leonard.

20:15.887 --> 20:17.520
"Last night was amazing.

20:17.522 --> 20:18.654
"You're amazing.

20:18.656 --> 20:21.457
I'm so lucky to have you
in my life."

20:24.328 --> 20:25.495
Please, stop it.

20:33.218 --> 20:35.053
Hey, Bernie, guess what?

20:35.055 --> 20:37.322
I stood up to the other
astronauts like you said

20:37.324 --> 20:40.058
and I got to tell you,
last night was the first time

20:40.060 --> 20:42.160
in a week I got
a good night's sleep.

20:48.868 --> 20:52.203
Oh, Howie.

20:52.205 --> 20:54.506
What's wrong?
You look upset.

20:54.508 --> 20:57.075
Nope, this is my proud face.
