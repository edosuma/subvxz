20:53.585 --> 20:56.588
He's a two-foot-tall
interdimensional imp
who stans Batman.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.173
I'd rather be with him.

20:58.256 --> 20:59.758
-Is that a real guy?
-Yeah.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.803
-Let's finish.
-Fuck is the world coming to?

21:02.886 --> 21:04.680
From the beginning,
I've kept this operation

21:04.763 --> 21:07.015
completely off the books.
So how did this...

21:07.099 --> 21:09.184
-What's the dead woman's name?
-Annie Sturphausen.

21:09.267 --> 21:11.853
How did this Annie Sturphausen
know about Peacemaker?

21:11.937 --> 21:14.189
Maybe someone's feeding
the butterflies information.

21:14.272 --> 21:15.148
-Who?
-Waller.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.318
-It's not her.
-(HARCOURT SCOFFS)

21:18.402 --> 21:20.529
MURN: I don't
think it's Waller, either.

21:20.612 --> 21:24.116
You don't know her like I do.
I saw Waller
knowingly sacrifice troops,

21:24.199 --> 21:28.078
including a colonel
in the United States Army,
to meet her objective.

21:28.161 --> 21:31.164
We could simply be
a decoy team from whomever
else she's really entrusted

21:31.248 --> 21:33.792
-with taking down
the butterflies.
-Still no reason to give us up.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.378
Well, the four of us
and Waller are the only ones
who knew about it.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.548
You're the one who
brought the butterflies to our
attention, so it can't be you.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.884
And it's not me,
I just put my ass on the line
to save Muscle Man Weekly.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.804
And it's not Muscle Man Weekly,
because he's the one
who almost got killed.

21:45.887 --> 21:48.473
So, if it's not Waller
and it's not us,

21:48.557 --> 21:50.642
-maybe it's her.
-Me?

21:50.726 --> 21:53.061
Does anyone here know how
she ended up on this mission?

21:53.145 --> 21:54.688
I got skills.

21:54.771 --> 21:58.567
I got my Binks-Fendelmire

PEACEMAKER: It's not her.

22:09.327 --> 22:11.830

-John didn't do it.
-Thank you.

22:23.633 --> 22:26.803
-He's too big of a pussy
to betray us.
-All right.

Not on purpose,
but okay, follow me.

his balls in somebody's mouth,

try to kill Peacemaker?

Maybe she brought him back
to her apartment for the purpose
he thought she did.

after they hooked up
that she needed to kill him?
