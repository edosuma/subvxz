living below the elevators.

01:24.478 --> 01:25.758
- Love.

01:25.758 --> 01:27.582
Why is it that when you're in it,

01:27.582 --> 01:29.974
you can't remember not being in it?

01:29.974 --> 01:32.635
And when you're not in
it, it's like what is it?

01:33.695 --> 01:36.187
Why is it not just in
and of itself, in or out?

01:39.417 --> 01:42.126
I should do my own podcast.

01:42.126 --> 01:44.259
- This looks like Espraza the maid.

01:44.259 --> 01:46.393

maid and a little maid.

01:46.393 --> 01:48.483
- I don't like chocolate people.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.190

01:51.491 --> 01:53.785
- Doctor Black, you spend a lot of time

01:53.785 --> 01:55.715
treating Nicky, but his
advanced aging disease

01:55.715 --> 01:57.232
seems to be getting worse.

01:57.232 --> 01:58.357
- I have gout.

01:58.357 --> 01:59.449
- Why don't you go down to the cafeteria

01:59.449 --> 02:01.785
and get us an eight pack
of Smirnoff Ice, yeah?

02:01.785 --> 02:03.214
- Can you get on with the exam

02:03.214 --> 02:04.590
Please, before Nicky gets any older?

02:04.590 --> 02:06.606
- God look at those eyes.

02:06.606 --> 02:07.619

02:13.070 --> 02:15.204
- Well then I wish I knew
you when you were four.

02:15.204 --> 02:16.558
- Here's a question.

02:16.558 --> 02:17.352
- What?

02:17.352 --> 02:19.036
- Are space bugs real?

02:19.036 --> 02:22.636

doing, it's cold in here?

02:29.138 --> 02:30.172

02:35.047 --> 02:36.082

02:36.082 --> 02:37.852
- She just tried kissing me two weeks ago.

02:37.852 --> 02:40.806
- Well she'll date
anything, no offense to me.

02:40.806 --> 02:43.260
- None taken.

02:43.260 --> 02:44.946
- Remember when she dated Josh Brolin?

02:44.946 --> 02:46.151
- Remember when she dated Josh Brolin's

02:46.151 --> 02:47.303
character in Goonies?

02:47.303 --> 02:48.732
- Remember when she dated that sculpture

02:48.732 --> 02:50.535
of our hospital's founder, Mr. Childrens?

02:50.535 --> 02:51.388
(laughs)

02:51.388 --> 02:52.369
- In Goonies.

02:52.369 --> 02:53.479
- No he wasn't in Goonies.

02:53.479 --> 02:54.396
- He wasn't in Goonies?

02:54.396 --> 02:56.188
Who's, oh you know who I'm thinking of?

02:56.188 --> 02:56.838
- Huh?

02:56.838 --> 02:58.118
- Josh Brolin.

02:59.965 --> 03:03.105
- She'll date anything,
what does that make us?

03:05.365 --> 03:07.235
- The two hottest doctors in here.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.935
- You are so true.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.789
- I feel dizzy.

03:15.789 --> 03:17.256
- I want to get deep inside of you.

03:18.467 --> 03:20.470

from Children's to recieve

03:22.710 --> 03:23.702

03:23.702 --> 03:25.366
- Well, it was just for medicine.

03:25.366 --> 03:27.137
They offered me the Peace
Prize but I turned it down

03:27.137 --> 03:29.153
because I don't want the
bitches to think I'm a gaylord.

03:30.253 --> 03:32.632
- Well Max, I'm very busy, so.

03:32.632 --> 03:36.184
- Right. I'm outtie RS4
with the gold package.

03:43.355 --> 03:44.475
- Excuse me?

03:44.475 --> 03:45.648
- You have MS?

03:45.648 --> 03:47.355
- A touch.

03:47.355 --> 03:49.286
Probably a little Parkinson's
in there too, right?

03:49.286 --> 03:50.224
- Little bit.

03:50.224 --> 03:51.322
- How much Cerebral Palsy do you have?

03:51.322 --> 03:53.253
- I have a splash, it's going around, why?

03:55.078 --> 03:56.512
- You sitting down?

03:58.555 --> 04:00.085
I can cure you.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.987
Wait okay, careful.

04:32.904 --> 04:33.757
- Okay I'm sorry.

04:33.757 --> 04:35.315
I just got to get my
head wrapped around this.

04:35.315 --> 04:36.861
So you're saying that
there is a law that says

04:36.861 --> 04:39.731
we cannot test new drugs on rare pandas?

04:39.731 --> 04:40.989
- That's what I am saying.

04:40.989 --> 04:41.661
- Really?

04:41.661 --> 04:42.365
- Mhm.

04:45.085 --> 04:45.938
- While we are on the subject,

04:45.938 --> 04:46.824
can I ask you another question?

04:46.824 --> 04:47.603
- Mhm.

04:47.603 --> 04:48.371
- Is there a law against jerking off

04:48.371 --> 04:50.120
in a government office cubical?

04:50.120 --> 04:52.168
- This genital ward will
put Children's Hospital

04:52.168 --> 04:55.709
on the forefront of
modern genital technology.

04:57.309 --> 04:59.165

05:10.547 --> 05:11.667
the nuerospecialist?

05:11.667 --> 05:13.129
- Dr Max von Sydow?

05:13.129 --> 05:15.102
- Yeah I heard he won a Nobel Peace Prize.

05:15.102 --> 05:16.941
Funny he doesn't look like a fag.

05:18.270 --> 05:19.347
- He says he can cure me.

05:19.347 --> 05:20.990
- What?

05:20.990 --> 05:22.643
Hold on Chief, if he does that,

05:22.643 --> 05:24.286
you might lose your sexy strut.

05:24.286 --> 05:28.190
- Strut. Maybe but, I have
no feeling in my pelvis.

05:28.190 --> 05:29.609
- I'll feel that **** for you.

05:29.609 --> 05:31.379
- You're sweet.

that were never called

05:39.283 --> 05:42.547
special or crippled or handicrippled.

05:42.547 --> 05:45.779
- I bet you say that to all the girls.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.166
- No I don't.

05:47.166 --> 05:47.913
- Oh yeah, I guess you wouldn't.

05:47.913 --> 05:49.321
- I don't know any other
handicapped people.

05:49.321 --> 05:50.089
- Oh, right.

05:50.961 --> 05:52.060

06:26.924 --> 06:29.508
- Oh yeah, I'm going to
look under everything.

06:29.508 --> 06:31.537

06:31.537 --> 06:32.348
- Can't you wait five minutes?

06:32.348 --> 06:34.300
- I could count to 100.

06:34.300 --> 06:35.065

healing power of laughter off.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.620
(Horn honks)

06:56.620 --> 06:59.158
You have one week to preform
a successful operation

06:59.158 --> 07:00.886
using only the healing power of laughter.

07:00.886 --> 07:04.196
If you fail, you hang up
your balloony pants forever.

07:06.406 --> 07:07.637
I won't fail.

07:09.187 --> 07:10.397
No I won't.

07:11.593 --> 07:13.299
Fine. Jesus.

07:13.299 --> 07:16.371
If I fail, I leave medicine all together.

That's what I'm doing right now,

07:32.941 --> 07:34.936
in a clear and authoritative voice.

07:42.275 --> 07:44.408
- That's it, this kids
getting a vasectomy.

07:44.408 --> 07:45.799

- [Advanced Aging Patient] Diego?

07:49.963 --> 07:53.125
My mom says that Israels
an outdated concept.

07:54.218 --> 07:55.659
- Thank you for watching
these two episodes

07:55.659 --> 07:56.960
of Children's Hospital.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.741
A lot of people ask me
where I got the idea

07:58.741 --> 08:00.491
for Children's Hospital
and it's a funny story.

08:00.491 --> 08:03.883
My two year old daughter
dislocated her shoulder,

08:03.883 --> 08:06.624
and we had to bring her
to a Children's Hospital.

08:06.624 --> 08:09.611
I just remember the waiting
room was terrifying.

08:09.611 --> 08:12.843
It was full of nervous
parents, most of them crying,

08:15.583 --> 08:17.221
all pale, this isn't the funny part.

08:17.221 --> 08:20.229
This gurney, this tiny
little gurney comes crashing

08:20.229 --> 08:22.160
through the door and it's
surrounded by doctors

08:22.160 --> 08:23.823
and nurses and they're
yelling and they look

08:23.823 --> 08:25.417
really scared.

08:25.417 --> 08:28.245
There's this tiny body on the gurney,

08:28.245 --> 08:29.749
the funny parts coming.

08:29.749 --> 08:34.073
There's this life flight
pilot behind the gurney,

08:35.029 --> 08:38.298
and he looks at me and he
goes " Mondays, right? "

08:41.063 --> 08:42.778
He didn't actually say that.

08:45.856 --> 08:47.994
So then I made a TV show about it.
