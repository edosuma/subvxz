14:21.229 --> 14:22.287
Tell me what you got.

14:22.288 --> 14:24.383
Okay, Jake did his
undergraduate in Australia.

14:24.384 --> 14:27.750
He majored in computer science with
a focus on artificial intelligence.

14:27.751 --> 14:31.495
From the papers he wrote, he seems
like an extremely smart individual.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.431
Someone with that kind of
skill could've pulled this off.

14:33.432 --> 14:34.568
Yeah, but from where?

14:34.569 --> 14:35.432
It gets better.

14:35.433 --> 14:36.391
While he was studying,

14:36.392 --> 14:39.499
there were four unsolved murders
in the town surrounding Sydney.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.138
They match the killer's MO.

14:41.208 --> 14:42.267
Like he was warming up.

14:42.268 --> 14:45.299
Bolin was the last name of the aunt
who raised him after his parents died.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.411
There's no US birth
certificates with that name.

14:47.412 --> 14:48.594
Probable he deleted it.

14:48.595 --> 14:51.658
But I crosschecked with his
age and NYC hospital records...

14:51.659 --> 14:53.114
Bolin was his mother's
maiden name.

14:53.115 --> 14:56.294
Father: Leo Langley.
Both US citizens.

14:56.295 --> 14:57.412
Father had a record.

14:57.413 --> 14:59.785
He was imprisoned at Rikers
for violent assault.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.466
