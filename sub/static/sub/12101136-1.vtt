<i>Dave Kendall here
with the music news,</i>

04:03.745 --> 04:06.748
First up, a breaking story
from the U.K.

04:06.781 --> 04:09.349
<i>After months of speculation
in the press,</i>

04:09.382 --> 04:11.719
<i>The Smiths have officially
gone under.</i>

04:13.320 --> 04:16.557
<i>The Smiths,
one of the all time greats,</i>

04:16.591 --> 04:19.493
<i>strange ways,
there they go.</i>

04:19.527 --> 04:23.030
No!

04:26.067 --> 04:28.636
<i>Formed in
Manchester in 1982,</i>

04:28.669 --> 04:31.038
<i>The Smiths swiftly
became the voice</i>

04:31.072 --> 04:32.707
<i>of a doomed generation.</i>

04:32.740 --> 04:34.776
<i>They emerged into
the uncertain arena</i>

04:34.809 --> 04:36.611
<i>of early '80s Britain</i>

04:36.644 --> 04:38.445
<i>like a fully formed gang,</i>

04:38.478 --> 04:40.413
<i>and invited you to join.</i>

04:40.447 --> 04:43.084
I feel The Smiths
create their world

04:43.117 --> 04:44.585
and not many groups do that.

04:44.619 --> 04:47.522
And you can either go in
or you can say no.

04:47.555 --> 04:48.923
And it's your choice, really.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.626
We wanted to ditch everything
that people

04:51.659 --> 04:54.028
superficially think
is rock 'n' roll...

04:54.061 --> 04:56.898
leather trousers
and long hair and drugs.

04:56.931 --> 04:59.600
We had something that no one
else could really grasp,

04:59.634 --> 05:01.636
which was, like,
totally ours exclusively.

05:01.669 --> 05:02.937
Do you have many friends?

05:02.970 --> 05:04.772
No, I don't.

05:06.941 --> 05:08.375
Those that you have,

05:08.408 --> 05:09.977
are they
in the music industry?

05:10.011 --> 05:11.913
They're in the group.
They're in The Smiths.

05:11.946 --> 05:13.781
So The Smiths
are your only friends?

05:13.815 --> 05:15.516
As far as I can see, yeah.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.404
Hey, Cleo.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.657
Hey, look, here.
What are we talking about?

05:56.691 --> 05:59.093
No depressing crap in the store.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.528
The Smiths just broke up.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.495
Oh, maybe because
they called their record

06:02.530 --> 06:03.531
"The World Won't Listen."

06:03.564 --> 06:04.732
Way to go, geniuses.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.567
Check this out.

06:10.972 --> 06:14.609
Can't you just picture
fucking to this?

06:14.642 --> 06:15.776
Before you close up,

06:15.810 --> 06:17.178
I need you to re-price
all the CDs.

06:17.211 --> 06:21.182
And you have to check
the security strips.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.718
All of them?
All the CDs.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.486
Wait a minute.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.156
Yes, all of them.

06:29.190 --> 06:30.925
And the tapes.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.927
Kids keep peeling them off.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.595
You know what?

06:34.629 --> 06:36.197
If you did your job
for like two seconds,

06:36.230 --> 06:39.033
instead of daydreaming
about Depressed Mode,

06:39.066 --> 06:41.736
half of my stock wouldn't be
walking out of here every day.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.205
I'm only making money
on sunglasses now

06:44.238 --> 06:47.608
KISS 101,
the rock of Denver.

06:47.642 --> 06:49.543
How can you stand it?

06:49.577 --> 06:51.812
There are times
I could murder him.

06:51.846 --> 06:55.216
Dean. Dean.

06:55.249 --> 06:58.485
Dean.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.787
It's not loaded.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.623
Just to scare the shoplifters.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.667
So what do we do now?

07:12.700 --> 07:17.204
Our music died today,
and nobody even cares.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.744
I wish there was a way to get
all the posers in this town

07:23.778 --> 07:26.180
to take notice.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.549
You know,
The Smiths may be dead,

07:28.582 --> 07:30.685
but all the albums
are still here,

07:30.718 --> 07:33.888
all the records,
seven-inch singles, 12-inches,

07:33.921 --> 07:36.657
We have all
those great bootlegs.

07:36.691 --> 07:39.660
That'll be here forever.

07:39.694 --> 07:42.029
No one can ever
take it away from us.

07:53.174 --> 07:54.608
I hope you're right.

07:56.577 --> 07:59.513
So you want to hang out?

07:59.547 --> 08:01.716
I can close up early.

08:03.017 --> 08:04.085
Mm.

08:04.118 --> 08:06.821
My friend is going off
to basic training tomorrow,

08:06.854 --> 08:11.993
and everyone is in town
for the weekend to say goodbye.

08:12.026 --> 08:13.561
So...

08:13.861 --> 08:15.963
You know of any good parties?

08:15.997 --> 08:17.231
Me? No.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.632
I was gonna stay in, maybe,

08:18.666 --> 08:20.167
and make you a tape
of this new band

08:20.201 --> 08:21.535
from Manchester.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.204
New band from Manchester?

08:23.237 --> 08:25.906
Oh, sacrilege.

08:25.940 --> 08:27.742
- Happy Mondays.
- Happy.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.544
Oh, I hate them already.

08:30.578 --> 08:33.114
- I did have another idea.
- What is it?

08:33.147 --> 08:35.750
Something that would go down
in musical history.

08:35.783 --> 08:38.319
But I can't tell you what it is.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.729
It's Dean from the record store.

22:08.763 --> 22:10.131
I was in there today.

22:10.164 --> 22:11.799
Stealing tapes?

22:11.833 --> 22:15.069
He was almost as upset
about The Smiths breaking up

22:15.102 --> 22:16.571
as I was.

22:16.604 --> 22:18.005
And he had a gun, you know?

22:18.039 --> 22:22.510

22:45.199 --> 22:49.971
Are you and Patrick
still pretending to be a couple?

22:50.004 --> 22:52.006
I do love him.

22:52.039 --> 22:53.774
Okay, but...

22:53.808 --> 22:55.475
You want your freedom.

22:56.911 --> 22:59.013
We had sex once.

22:59.046 --> 23:00.081
Once.

23:00.114 --> 23:02.415
And then he discovered
The Smiths,

23:02.449 --> 23:05.119
and it was all
no meat, no sex.

23:05.152 --> 23:08.556

But why?

24:06.013 --> 24:07.782
Before he flies away to London,

26:49.243 --> 26:51.879
You should consider
a candlelight vigil,

26:51.912 --> 26:55.116
something slightly
less illegal.

26:55.149 --> 26:58.886
It called for a more
dramatic gesture.

26:58.919 --> 27:01.856
Yeah, well, if the Denver
suicide rate spikes overnight,

27:01.889 --> 27:03.757
it's on your head, not mine.

27:04.391 --> 27:06.694
I tried that once.

27:06.727 --> 27:10.364
Tried what?

27:10.397 --> 27:11.699
Suicide?

27:11.732 --> 27:14.235
Are you serious?

27:14.268 --> 27:16.770
It didn't work, obviously.

27:16.804 --> 27:19.773
Not that it would have
made much of a difference.

27:20.908 --> 27:24.078

to live for these days.

29:28.269 --> 29:29.470

29:29.504 --> 29:32.139
cram down our throats
day and night...

29:32.172 --> 29:34.008

Reality sucks.

29:54.428 --> 29:56.864

a hooligan.

I don't know how you can stand
going to community college here.

31:26.487 --> 31:30.023

of this humdrum town.

31:32.059 --> 31:34.027
It's not like
I don't have ambition.

31:34.061 --> 31:37.164
I just thought everything
would be different for me.

has agreed to allow me
to open up the phone lines.

32:29.684 --> 32:31.686
So I'm going to be taking
a few special callers

32:31.719 --> 32:33.320

32:49.804 --> 32:51.405
This is Sandi from Arvada.

32:54.709 --> 32:56.310

to keep on listening

because The Smiths are
the greatest band in the world,

32:58.412 --> 33:00.748

we heard our music on the radio.

39:37.879 --> 39:40.615

39:40.648 --> 39:44.484
This is not
an ordinary rock song.

39:44.518 --> 39:45.820
Why don't you open
your ears, man?

39:45.853 --> 39:46.988
<i>What American city?</i>

39:47.021 --> 39:49.657
You're so obsessed with
Morrissey and the mopey mopes

39:49.690 --> 39:51.993
that you can't hear what's good
about other kinds of music.

39:54.095 --> 39:54.762
What are you doing?

39:54.795 --> 39:56.931
Okay, ease up there, Rebel Yell.

39:56.964 --> 39:58.966
All this talk of mind opening
just reminded me

39:59.000 --> 40:01.702
I've got some pretty killer
Columbian red

40:01.736 --> 40:04.639
in my Kiss lunchbox.

40:16.918 --> 40:19.654
Come on, man,
put the gun down.

40:19.687 --> 40:21.622
Smoke some drugs with me.

40:26.227 --> 40:28.963
Yeah, buddy.

40:40.675 --> 40:44.979
Now, if you don't
mind my asking,

40:45.012 --> 40:47.615
what could be so bad
that you'd want to end it all

40:47.648 --> 40:50.518
before you even graduated
high school?

40:50.551 --> 40:53.187
My life sucked.

40:53.220 --> 40:56.958
No one knew me,
and yet everyone gave me shit.

40:56.991 --> 40:59.026
Even the nerds.

40:59.060 --> 41:03.164
And the girl
I thought I liked.

41:03.197 --> 41:05.166
So I found a razor blade.

41:08.102 --> 41:11.906
I'll never forget, though,
my first day back at work,

41:11.939 --> 41:15.743
we got this new import in.

41:15.776 --> 41:17.044
I had never
heard of them before.

41:17.078 --> 41:21.849
I just listened to it
over and over again.

41:21.882 --> 41:23.985
It's like nothing
I'd ever heard.

41:24.018 --> 41:27.088
Martyrdom
and meaningless death,

41:27.121 --> 41:31.592
guilt and heroism,
sex and celibacy,

41:31.625 --> 41:35.863
catharsis and deceit.

41:37.131 --> 41:42.236
All the horrors
you have to face up to.

41:42.269 --> 41:45.006
I owe them everything.

41:45.773 --> 41:47.274
They saved my life.

41:47.308 --> 41:50.878
Well, in the end, man,
they're just a band.

41:50.911 --> 41:52.680
They break up all the time.

41:52.713 --> 41:55.149
But they are
the only band that matters.

41:55.182 --> 41:58.919
Clearly never listened
to Twisted fucking Sister.

42:08.329 --> 42:11.065
You know, dude,

42:11.098 --> 42:13.601
one day your heroes
are going to grow old,

42:13.634 --> 42:15.970
and they're going to change.

42:16.003 --> 42:18.239
And they're going to put out
shitty music.

42:18.272 --> 42:22.209
And they're going to say stupid
things that betray the past.

42:22.243 --> 42:25.046
In the end,
they will only disappoint you.

42:25.079 --> 42:26.714
Jesus.

42:26.747 --> 42:29.950
Are you sure
you're not a Smiths fan?

42:29.984 --> 42:34.688
I know "It's Over" is next,
but it is far from being so.

42:34.722 --> 42:36.690
But don't despair, Denver.

42:36.724 --> 42:41.062
Relax, have a smoke,
have a toke,

47:41.663 --> 47:44.098
I took down all the mirrors
in our house.

47:46.701 --> 47:50.904

I disappear.

47:53.340 --> 47:57.077

47:58.112 --> 48:01.048

48:01.081 --> 48:06.053
maybe... maybe just
to please my dad, I guess.

48:06.554 --> 48:09.356

just wants to smoke joints,

48:09.390 --> 48:11.458

57:36.791 --> 57:39.093
So it was child abuse
by meat loaf

57:39.126 --> 57:40.828
that drove you
to this life of crime?

57:40.861 --> 57:43.764
Yeah, they're not so bad,
my folks.

57:43.798 --> 57:46.267
They just worship
my older brother.

57:46.300 --> 57:47.868
Quarterback?

57:47.902 --> 57:51.639
Quarterback, pitcher,
power forward.

57:51.672 --> 57:54.642
He plays golf.
It's ridiculous.

57:54.675 --> 57:56.811
I'm invisible.

57:56.844 --> 58:00.114
But, yeah, meat loaf
every single Monday.

58:16.797 --> 58:19.567

popular music should be used

58:19.600 --> 58:21.168
in order to make
serious statements

58:21.202 --> 58:25.172
because so many groups sell
masses and masses of records

58:25.206 --> 58:28.542
and don't raise people's
level of consciousness

58:28.576 --> 58:29.844
in any direction.

58:29.877 --> 58:31.645

when I was 12.

58:49.063 --> 58:50.865
And I figured
if Geezer Butler,

58:50.898 --> 58:54.235
vegan metal God of Black Sabbath
could do it.

58:54.268 --> 58:56.604
No shit.

I'm so tired of myself tonight.

1:00:24.291 --> 1:00:26.760
I just want to be somebody else.

1:00:28.195 --> 1:00:30.698
Be yourself.

1:00:30.731 --> 1:00:33.000

Are you trying to steal
Patrick from me?

1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:09.770
I'm just trying to show
Patrick who he is.

1:01:09.803 --> 1:01:13.440
If I can't be me,
maybe he can be him.

1:01:16.410 --> 1:01:18.112

your bow tie.

1:01:51.546 --> 1:01:52.880

into the store I work at

hot metal chicks out there

1:06:40.835 --> 1:06:43.237
listen to my show every week?

1:06:43.270 --> 1:06:46.641

1:06:56.316 --> 1:07:00.053
She was talking directly to you.

1:07:00.087 --> 1:07:03.357
So what do I do?

1:07:03.390 --> 1:07:06.126
I'd dedicate a song to her.

1:07:06.159 --> 1:07:07.662

1:07:25.312 --> 1:07:27.749
About a year ago.

1:07:27.782 --> 1:07:30.652
Same day "Master of Puppets"
came out.

1:07:33.353 --> 1:07:39.493
I had it on super loud
in my headphones all day.

1:07:39.527 --> 1:07:41.629
I didn't even hear her leave.

1:07:44.599 --> 1:07:46.500
There I was in thrash nirvana,

1:07:46.534 --> 1:07:51.471
no idea that the love of my life
was about to rip my guts out.

1:07:51.506 --> 1:07:56.410
I haven't been able to listen
to that album since.

1:07:56.443 --> 1:07:59.346
How long were you together?

1:07:59.379 --> 1:08:02.784
Since high school.

1:08:02.817 --> 1:08:04.786
Why did you break up?

1:08:07.755 --> 1:08:11.659
I guess the metal lifestyle
just wasn't for her.

1:08:11.693 --> 1:08:16.496
And she hated
that I worked nights.

1:08:18.566 --> 1:08:22.570
We just grew apart.

1:08:22.604 --> 1:08:25.205

that made you cry

1:08:37.652 --> 1:08:40.253

Ozzy's last album,
and Sabbath "Never Say Die."

1:12:47.001 --> 1:12:48.703
Although "Heaven and Hell"
kicked ass,

1:12:48.736 --> 1:12:51.806
I will be an Ozzy man

No, let him go!

I'm sick and tired

1:16:11.906 --> 1:16:14.875
Nice right hook there,
Demolition Man.

1:16:21.015 --> 1:16:23.017

1:17:21.709 --> 1:17:24.411
What?

1:17:24.445 --> 1:17:25.980
There's a murky river

1:17:26.013 --> 1:17:27.715
of musical history
running through these songs,

1:17:27.748 --> 1:17:29.316
from Bo Diddley to Bowie,

1:17:29.350 --> 1:17:31.819

1:17:33.487 --> 1:17:38.392
from Motown all the way
to Manchester.

1:17:38.425 --> 1:17:40.127
Tonight, two musical cultures

1:17:40.161 --> 1:17:42.396
reached across the divide
to each other,

1:17:42.429 --> 1:17:45.199
and it seems that
in these uncertain times

1:17:45.232 --> 1:17:47.735
of chaos and fear,

1:17:47.768 --> 1:17:50.871
a song can still
save your life,

1:17:50.905 --> 1:17:52.439
it's all or nothing
with the Smiths

1:17:52.473 --> 1:17:53.707
and those that love them.

1:17:53.741 --> 1:17:54.708
It is life and death.

1:17:54.742 --> 1:17:56.810
It's music full of love and hate

1:17:56.844 --> 1:17:59.680

just like ours.

The meetings
between the group members

1:21:15.342 --> 1:21:16.611
were very accidental.

1:21:16.644 --> 1:21:18.546
It was also
a very barren time

1:21:18.580 --> 1:21:20.515
when everybody seemed
to be lost,

1:21:20.548 --> 1:21:24.451
and the vile elements
were taking over.

1:21:28.556 --> 1:21:31.626
Four strangers cannot
simply huddle together

1:21:31.659 --> 1:21:33.427

1:21:35.329 --> 1:21:36.698
well, there has to be some kind

1:21:36.731 --> 1:21:40.934

1:21:44.438 --> 1:21:46.440
But with the Smiths
on another level,

1:21:46.473 --> 1:21:48.942
I really do think
it is true.

1:21:48.976 --> 1:21:53.313

1:22:58.746 --> 1:23:01.014

1:23:01.048 --> 1:23:03.585
