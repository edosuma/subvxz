WEBVTT

00:03.737 --> 00:05.773
("March of the Toy Soldiers"
from The Nutcracker plays)

00:05.806 --> 00:06.640
So...

00:06.674 --> 00:08.342
What did you think?
Oh, I loved it.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.710
Thank you, Daddy.

00:09.743 --> 00:12.313
Logan?
Uh, pass.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.781
Come on. It
wasn't that bad.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.416
Well, not the first
eight times, no,

00:15.449 --> 00:17.718
but if I had known this was
a Green holiday tradition,

00:17.751 --> 00:19.820
I would have shot myself
on our wedding night.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.056
Oh, such a
hopeless romantic.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.657
(Logan chuckles)

00:23.691 --> 00:25.326
Ugh. There's my ride.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.428
Should we do this again
next week?

00:27.461 --> 00:29.697
I'd rather lick
a chalkboard.

00:29.730 --> 00:30.831
(laughs)
Yeah. I bet you would.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.766
(laughing)

00:32.800 --> 00:35.703
(sighs)

00:35.736 --> 00:38.706
(engine starts)

00:38.739 --> 00:40.141
DRIVER:
Welcome, Captain.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.742
Thank you.

00:41.775 --> 00:44.745
Can I interest you in a charge?
Or water for the ride?

00:44.778 --> 00:46.680
Uh, water's fine, thanks.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.416
There you go.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.826
I haven't seen The
Nutcracker in years.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.294
It still hold up?

01:00.328 --> 01:01.729
I don't know.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.564
(laughing):
I never watch
the performance,

01:03.597 --> 01:05.866
just my
little girl's face.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.635
(chuckling)
It still lights up

01:07.668 --> 01:10.138
(coughing):
every time...

01:10.171 --> 01:12.506
(coughing):
every time that...

01:17.678 --> 01:19.680
(coughing and choking)

01:25.153 --> 01:27.821
(gagging, choking)

01:33.861 --> 01:36.096
(gasping, choking)

01:40.834 --> 01:42.836
(gasping)

01:49.643 --> 01:52.313
(groaning)

01:59.353 --> 02:01.422
(grunts)

02:17.938 --> 02:20.140
*

02:50.971 --> 02:52.740
(dog barking in distance)

02:52.773 --> 02:54.542
(birds tweeting)

02:54.575 --> 02:56.610
(air horn blares)

02:56.644 --> 02:58.412
What?!

03:00.481 --> 03:01.849
What on earth are you doing?

03:01.882 --> 03:02.850
Me?

03:02.883 --> 03:04.518
What are you doing, Dad?

03:04.552 --> 03:05.986
I was sleeping.
I noticed.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.821
Still on Uncle Gibbs' couch
for some reason.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.790
You nearly scared me to death.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.226
And Uncle Gibbs
is probably upstairs

03:12.260 --> 03:14.362
loading his bazooka
as we speak.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.230
No. I'm good.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.300
Thanks for the warning.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.536
I thought you weren't back
from school till tomorrow.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.837
My boyfriend got off work
a day early,

03:23.871 --> 03:25.706
but no way am I
introducing him to you

03:25.739 --> 03:27.308
while you're living on a couch.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.542
I'm not living.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.811
I am... recuperating.

03:30.844 --> 03:31.812
Okay, well,

03:31.845 --> 03:34.882
you can recuperate at home
where I can make sure

03:34.915 --> 03:37.551
you do the exercises
Gibbs says you're not doing.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.720
Really?

03:39.753 --> 03:41.255
That's what he says?

03:41.289 --> 03:43.424
Fine. I'll do my exercises.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.992
Hey, Gibbs.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.361
You got to come over and
push down on my pelvis.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.696
I'm gonna pass on that.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.599
See?
See what I'm up against?

03:51.632 --> 03:53.967
How can I do
my exercises if...?

03:57.571 --> 03:59.006
Did you say boyfriend?

03:59.039 --> 04:01.942
I heard boyfriend,
did you hear boyfriend?

04:01.975 --> 04:03.611
No.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.413
Yes, you heard boyfriend.

04:05.446 --> 04:09.317
His name is Jack, and he's
studying to be an entomologist.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.051
Ento...
Bugs.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.953
I know what an entomologist is.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.322
This is your fault.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.957
You enabled him.
Me?

04:16.990 --> 04:19.059
You are not old enough
to have a boyfriend.
(phone rings)

04:19.092 --> 04:20.528
(scoffs)

04:20.561 --> 04:21.695
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.531
And how old do you need to be?

04:23.564 --> 04:25.933
A year older than you are, and
every year it goes up by one.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.935
GIBBS:
Yeah. I'll meet you there.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.169
Where do you think you're going?
Got a dead body.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.705
You're gonna have another one
in your living room in a minute.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.974
(dog barking in distance)

04:34.007 --> 04:35.042
(door closes)

04:36.510 --> 04:38.379
(camera shutter clicking)

04:38.412 --> 04:40.381
McGEE:
Looks like Captain Green's a fan
of The Nutcracker.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.550
Any witnesses?

04:42.583 --> 04:44.017
Metro said that
a witness saw him

04:44.051 --> 04:46.454
get into a rideshare car
after the show.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.988
Then five blocks away,
here he lay dead in the dirt.

04:48.021 --> 04:48.989
(camera shutter clicks)

04:49.022 --> 04:50.658
Must've been one hell of a ride.

04:50.691 --> 04:51.725
No signs of foul play.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.361
There sure is foul smells.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.496
Is this a dirt lot
or a community toilet?

04:57.665 --> 04:59.299
(siren chirps)

05:02.570 --> 05:04.405
What's with the
wardrobe change?

05:04.438 --> 05:07.040
You know how hard it is to get
the smell of urine out of suede?

05:07.074 --> 05:09.343
And that's something
you're familiar with?

05:10.811 --> 05:12.780
JIMMY:
What did happen to this man?

05:12.813 --> 05:14.014
That's a good question.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.916
He's got a ton of money
left in his wallet,

05:15.949 --> 05:17.117
so it can't be robbery.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.052
We need to find out
where he was headed

05:19.086 --> 05:20.053
and how he got here.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.490
Maybe Reston.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.091
Reston?

05:24.124 --> 05:26.126
(chuckling):
I used to
live in Reston

05:26.159 --> 05:28.929
on a beautiful
tree-lined street on...

05:28.962 --> 05:30.664
McCadden Place.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.501
Yes. 1-0...

05:33.534 --> 05:36.637
7-3-5?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.806
What is a dead man
doing with your address

05:38.839 --> 05:40.608
in his pocket,
Dr. Mallard?

05:44.412 --> 05:48.348
I'm not sure I want to know
the answer to that.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.458
McGEE:
Captain Mason Green.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.826
Served three
back-to-back tours

05:58.859 --> 06:00.494
as an advisor in Iraq.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.463
Wife is deceased,
has one grown daughter.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.964
GIBBS:
Do we know who picked him up
from the theater, yet?

06:03.997 --> 06:05.566
Still haven't found
his cell phone,

06:05.599 --> 06:06.734
which would indicate
the rideshare app

06:06.767 --> 06:08.669
he was using;
Abby's on it, though.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.571
Talk to the C.G.?
Yeah, and, uh,

06:10.604 --> 06:11.805
that's where
it gets interesting.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.041
Green was under
internal investigation.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.577
Suspected of selling
classified info.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.746
To who?
I.G. thinks it's
someone overseas.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.515
If Green's buyer knew
he was under investigation,

06:21.549 --> 06:23.917
he might have gotten nervous
and then took Green out.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.419
Does I.G. have a lead
on the buyer?

06:25.453 --> 06:26.587
They're sending the
file over now.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.822
In the meantime,
all we have is this:

06:28.856 --> 06:31.058
Ducky's old address,
which was

06:31.091 --> 06:32.826
in our dead guy's pocket.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.528
Ducky lived there
with his mother years ago.

06:34.562 --> 06:35.596
Sold it when she died.

06:35.629 --> 06:36.864
Six years ago.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.799
I mean, maybe it's
a coincidence.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.571
Oh. Oh, no.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.507
No. Rule 69:
No coincidences.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.908
No, actually
number 69 is

06:47.941 --> 06:49.743
never trust a woman
who doesn't trust their man.

06:49.777 --> 06:52.546
Huh? Wait, what?

06:52.580 --> 06:54.515
Really? That...

06:54.548 --> 06:58.452
sounds a little misogynistic,
don't you think? Huh?

06:58.486 --> 07:00.621
I mean, do you have a rule
that says "Never trust a man

07:00.654 --> 07:01.922
who doesn't trust his woman"?

07:01.955 --> 07:03.591
Think about it.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.825
Huh? No?

07:04.858 --> 07:07.027
Think about it.
Rule 51.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.029
Sometimes you're wrong.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.600
Agent Torres is, uh,
down with Ducky.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.101
They're trying to see
if they can figure out

07:14.134 --> 07:15.703
a connection to Captain Green.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.205
Take Bishop with you;
talk to the current owners.

07:18.238 --> 07:21.475
Maybe Green was looking
for them, not Ducky.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.811
That Ducky was just
a coincidence.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.481
Was he mocking me?
You know, I'm not sure.

07:27.515 --> 07:30.150
I've never seen Gibbs
mock anyone before.

07:32.085 --> 07:35.989
I'm sorry. I simply do not
recognize this man.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.692
Nor is his name
remotely familiar.

07:38.726 --> 07:41.061
Do you have any files
you can check or anything?

07:41.094 --> 07:43.564
I can assure you, my
memory is not at fault.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.065
Check anyway.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.868
But I'll check anyway.
GIBBS: What have you got?

07:47.901 --> 07:50.604
JIMMY:
Abby found traces of conotoxin
in his blood.

07:50.638 --> 07:53.173
It's a fast-acting poison;
presumably the cause of death.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.510
DUCKY:
Which we will check
on autopsy, of course.

07:56.544 --> 07:57.711
Hey, you mind waiting
until I leave

07:57.745 --> 07:59.647
before you open this guy up?

07:59.680 --> 08:02.249
What? I-I wouldn't have pegged
you as the squeamish type.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.684
No. I actually like
the sight of blood.

08:04.685 --> 08:05.886
It's just smell.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.621
You know, first
the alley,

08:07.655 --> 08:09.657
now this place... ugh.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.692
Here's a silly question.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.662
Do you guys, uh, you expense
the dry-cleaning, right?

08:14.695 --> 08:16.063
Oh, yeah. I do.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.899
Is that not okay?

08:18.932 --> 08:21.735
As I suspected, yeah,
there are no records

08:21.769 --> 08:24.271
of a Captain Green
in my files.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.673
I heard you travel a lot.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.975
Maybe you met him
on one of your trips?

08:28.008 --> 08:31.078
Where has the captain been
besides Iraq, that is?

08:31.111 --> 08:33.981
According to ICE, the only other
place he's been is Majorca.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.951
Majorca...

08:37.985 --> 08:40.287
Doc?

08:40.320 --> 08:43.290
I am guessing the doctor
has a story.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.959
Well, oddly enough,

08:45.993 --> 08:48.929
Majorca is one place
I haven't been.

08:48.962 --> 08:52.700
Although I-I do
still have a story.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.034
Quick! Hurry!

08:54.067 --> 08:55.903
Gosh, it's monkeys out there.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.338
Told you we should have
taxied over after the film.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.240
What? And miss the best
part about getting cold?

09:00.273 --> 09:03.043
(laughing):
What's that?

09:03.076 --> 09:04.712
Getting warm.

09:04.745 --> 09:08.348
Why don't we start with
a hot toddy, Dr. Mallard?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.217
Take it from there.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.721
I can work with that.

09:13.754 --> 09:17.024
WOMAN:
Your flat's really quite lovely.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.793
Not bad on a soldier's salary.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.729
You working for pin money
on the side?

09:21.762 --> 09:24.197
Actually, I wasn't
entirely honest.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.133
This isn't my home,
it belongs to my...

09:26.166 --> 09:27.735
Oh, my God!

09:27.768 --> 09:29.202
Mother!

09:29.236 --> 09:30.771
What are you
doing here?

09:30.804 --> 09:32.740
I might ask you the same thing.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.041
Raiding the
liquor cabinet.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.275
You're supposed
to be in Majorca.

09:35.308 --> 09:38.311
I got back early.
Who's the tramp?

09:38.345 --> 09:40.748
Mother.
Hello. My name is...

09:40.781 --> 09:43.383
Tramp will do nicely
until proven otherwise.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.386
And so far, you're not off
to a very good start.
Mother.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.755
We were simply stopping by...
(man sneezing)

09:50.190 --> 09:51.625
What was that?

09:51.659 --> 09:53.360
What? I didn't hear anything.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.931
And it's getting late,
so if you don't mind,

09:57.965 --> 10:00.167
I'd like to
get ready to...
(gasps)

10:00.200 --> 10:03.771
Ah. Hello, young man.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.406
I'm afraid you've caught me
at quite a disadvantage.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.941
Who the bloody hell are you?

10:07.975 --> 10:10.277
Uh, Balthazar Kilmeany.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.979
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.014
We met at the resort
in Majorca

10:14.047 --> 10:15.783
at a bagpipe class.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.118
Your mother's got quite
a set of lungs on her.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.820
Right. I will throw up on you.
Donald!

10:19.853 --> 10:21.188
Mind your manners.
Me?!

10:21.221 --> 10:23.757
You called my date a tramp.
Twice.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.292
With a naked man
in your wardrobe.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.260
Uh, perhaps I ought to go.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.663
I have an important board
meeting quite early.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.799
Put a sock in it.

10:31.832 --> 10:32.933
You're not going anywhere.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.668
They are.

10:34.702 --> 10:35.803
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me

10:35.836 --> 10:37.170
exactly what's going on.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.672
What's going on is...

10:41.842 --> 10:43.643
...we're in love.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.983
Well, aren't you going
to say anything?

10:50.017 --> 10:53.020
Yes.

10:54.187 --> 10:57.424
That's my hat.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.862
Care to share?

11:02.730 --> 11:04.297
Excuse me?

11:04.331 --> 11:07.134
Said you had a story.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.804
Oh, it's-it's
not particularly... relevant.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.841
And I just had breakfast.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.276
All right. Thanks, B.
That was Bishop.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.778
The victim's
daughter is here.

11:17.811 --> 11:18.746
Conference room.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.380
Come on, Duck.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.382
HALEY:
I don't understand.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.885
If it wasn't a robbery,
who killed my father?

11:24.918 --> 11:26.453
Trying to figure that out.

11:26.486 --> 11:29.790
This mean
anything to you?

11:29.823 --> 11:31.058
HALEY:
No.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.225
What is it?

11:32.259 --> 11:35.062
My old address.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.329
Did you know my father-in-law?

11:36.363 --> 11:38.331
Not that I'm aware.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.834
Do I look familiar to you?

11:40.868 --> 11:42.135
GIBBS:
Your father mention

11:42.169 --> 11:43.837
having any trouble at work?
Why?

11:43.871 --> 11:44.805
Was he in trouble at work?
Your father was being

11:44.838 --> 11:46.807
investigated
for selling classified secrets.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.808
Uh-uh.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.743
No, no. Not-not my dad.

11:49.777 --> 11:52.279
Has he been behaving strangely
of late?

11:52.312 --> 11:53.881
Not at all.

11:53.914 --> 11:54.848
Actually...

11:57.384 --> 12:00.520
Last week he was asking
some weird questions.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.156
Connections
I might have overseas.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.092
I didn't really think anything
of it at the time, but...

12:05.125 --> 12:08.028
whatever it was about,
if you knew her dad,

12:08.061 --> 12:10.430
there is no way
these accusations are true.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.265
Gibbs.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.769
Need a second.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.772
We just got back
from Ducky's old house.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.541
You talk to the owners?
No. Gardener said they've
been out of town over a month.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.511
But he did say Captain Green
had been there three days ago.

12:24.544 --> 12:25.879
Did he say why?

12:25.913 --> 12:26.713
Green was looking for somebody.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.116
He went to the house looking
for me.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.118
Well, he was looking
for a Mallard.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.086
I knew it.
BISHOP:
But not you.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.789
He was looking for
a Victoria Mallard.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.926
Mother?

12:53.040 --> 12:55.909
If you need to take a break,
let me know.
Oh,

12:55.943 --> 12:57.177
have we started?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.445
I couldn't tell
if you were trying or not.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.548
Oh, I didn't want to beat you
too quickly. You seemed, uh--

13:01.581 --> 13:04.051
you know, and everyone's talking
about it-- kind of fragile.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.354
Me, fragile?
You're the one sweating.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.589
And I'm busy.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.025
So please finish comparing
testosterone levels

13:12.059 --> 13:13.894
on your own time.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.563
To be continued.

13:16.596 --> 13:19.366
I called you in here because
I just spoke with SecDef.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.534
It appears Captain Green's work
was more sensitive

13:21.568 --> 13:23.303
than the inspector general knew.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.472
If Green's really been
compromised, DoD needs to know

13:25.505 --> 13:28.909
who is buying his stolen intel
A.S.A.P.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.544
I.G. suspected
it was someone overseas. Reeves?

13:31.578 --> 13:33.881
I pulled a favor with some mates
of mine at Interpol,

13:33.914 --> 13:35.282
and they found a bank account

13:35.315 --> 13:37.117
in Captain Green's name
in the Crimea.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.586
Crimea. That means the Russians.
There's been

13:39.619 --> 13:41.955
several large deposits made
over the last month.
Did you

13:41.989 --> 13:44.124
trace them?
I've been going through the
paperwork. But so far, no luck.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.893
McGee's, uh,
trying the gardener again

13:45.926 --> 13:47.160
to see if he knows anything.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.929
All right,
dismissed.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.563
You can go crush beer cans
against your foreheads

13:50.597 --> 13:52.065
or whatever
you're planning next.

13:52.099 --> 13:55.903
Gibbs, did I read
your report correctly,

13:55.936 --> 13:57.604
that Captain Green was looking
for Dr. Mallard's mother?

13:57.637 --> 13:59.940
Yep.
The doctor have any idea why?

13:59.973 --> 14:00.908
Nope.

14:00.941 --> 14:01.942
How's he taking it?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.376
I mean,
I wouldn't be very happy

14:03.410 --> 14:05.212
knowing that my mother
might somehow be connected

14:05.245 --> 14:06.914
to international treason.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.548
You never met Ducky's mother?

14:08.581 --> 14:09.616
No, never had the chance.

14:09.649 --> 14:13.153
This doesn't really rank.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.655
(door opens)

14:15.688 --> 14:19.192
So, Ducky lived here
with his mother?

14:19.226 --> 14:20.560
For how long?

14:20.593 --> 14:21.895
Until she died.

14:21.929 --> 14:22.629
Hey!

14:22.662 --> 14:23.630
Careful!
You're walking

14:23.663 --> 14:25.532
on my winter mulch!

14:25.565 --> 14:27.935
Sorry about that, Mr. Rin.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.569
Agent McGee.
We spoke briefly.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.404
Yeah, hi.
QUINN:
We have just a few

14:31.438 --> 14:32.639
follow-up questions.
Oh, I bet.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.574
Donnie must have been
surprised to hear

14:34.607 --> 14:36.944
that his dearly departed
mom had a visitor.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.378
Uh, you know Dr. Mallard?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.613
Yeah, I worked for him
when he lived here.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.049
He's
a wonderful man.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.683
When Donnie decided
to sell,

14:43.716 --> 14:46.186
the new owners insisted
that I stay.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.921
So you, uh, knew
his mother, too?

14:47.955 --> 14:48.688
Oh, yeah.
Now, you said

14:48.721 --> 14:50.991
you saw this man
three days ago.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.659
Correct?
Yeah, he asked
about Victoria,

14:52.692 --> 14:54.427
and I told him she passed away.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.264
Then he got in his friend's car
and then left.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.199
He had a friend with him?
You catch his name?

14:59.232 --> 15:00.968
No, he stayed in the car.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.036
And I didn't get a good look
at him.
What about

15:03.070 --> 15:04.671
the car-- the make or the model?
Um,

15:04.704 --> 15:06.273
I think it was red.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.308
Ish.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.343
Possibly green.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.645
Mr. Rin, are you colorblind?

15:12.679 --> 15:13.546
Yeah. How'd you know?

15:13.580 --> 15:17.150
Well, maybe we can get
some witnesses or...

15:17.184 --> 15:19.987
Ooh. You know what,
actually, we may not need to.

15:20.020 --> 15:20.988
That is

15:21.021 --> 15:23.223
an XJ-47 doorbell camera.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.993
Brand-new.
You approach and it sends video

15:26.026 --> 15:28.361
straight to the cloud.
That is so cool, huh?

15:28.395 --> 15:30.998
No, not really.
Oh, yeah.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.700
Nice.

15:33.733 --> 15:36.536
Oh, look at this.
This thing is cool.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.705
Seriously, admit it.
This is cool.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.541
Look, I don't want to judge you,

15:41.574 --> 15:43.310
but if you push me, I will.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.077
McGee, back it up.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.178
(beep)

15:45.212 --> 15:48.715
(rewinding)

15:48.748 --> 15:50.417
GIBBS: Freeze it.
Right there.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.451
(beep)

15:52.185 --> 15:53.620
(beep)

15:55.422 --> 15:57.124
That's the car.
No plates.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.691
DUCKY:
Who's that in the car?

15:58.725 --> 16:01.494
Captain Green was accused
of selling classified data.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.462
Maybe that's his buyer?

16:02.495 --> 16:04.031
Or the killer.
Or both.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.299
You, uh,
recognize him, Ducky?
No.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.035
McGee, BOLO on the car.
Yeah.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.069
Better make that two.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.971
I was going through the footage,
and this happened.

16:16.076 --> 16:16.709
Wait for it.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.745
And...

16:20.313 --> 16:21.481
(engine starts)

16:21.514 --> 16:23.183
(revving)

16:23.216 --> 16:24.517
That looked very suspicious.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.752
Like she said,
two BOLOs.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.120
I have a lot more to say.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.788
Ducky, I need
those tissue samples.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.791
File in. To the Bat Lab!

16:31.824 --> 16:34.127
Oh, hey. Look who it is.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.729
Emily, how are you?
Give me a second, Abbs.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.802
You and I need to talk.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.671
I'm a little busy.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.739
Why haven't you kicked my dad
out of your house?
It's not

16:46.773 --> 16:48.541
for lack of effort.
This has gone on

16:48.575 --> 16:50.277
way too long.
You don't think

16:50.310 --> 16:51.111
I know that?

16:51.144 --> 16:52.745
So do something.

16:52.779 --> 16:56.116
I want to have Christmas dinner
with my father.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.285
At home.
I've tried.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.587
I have. I've tried. I don't know
what the problem is.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.190
So can I have your permission to
take matters into my own hands?

17:03.223 --> 17:04.391
To do whatever
I need

17:04.424 --> 17:05.258
to do?

17:05.292 --> 17:07.394
Yes.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.796
Don't burn down my house.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.831
Fine. Plan B then.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.401
Women, Ducky.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.839
My mother would have
never let it get this far.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.841
Yes, Diane was
a formidable woman.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.278
When she made up her mind,
nothing would stop her.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.146
(chuckles softly)

17:26.179 --> 17:29.116
Not unlike my mother.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.451
I'm not sure I see
the problem, Donnie.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.087
Mother and Balthazar
are engaged.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.622
Well, congratulations.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.624
I think that's enough
on the ornaments.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.226
I'm not paying you
on commission.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.161
It's only been six weeks.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.096
Please tell me
you're not developing some sort

17:43.130 --> 17:44.731
of weird Oedipal thing
about your mother.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.799
Ugh. Don't be a twonk.
Me?

17:46.833 --> 17:48.701
You're the one that's going
barmy. Your mother's in love.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.170
What's the big deal?

17:52.339 --> 17:54.741
(piano playing "Deck the Halls")

17:55.742 --> 17:57.710
(clears throat)

17:57.744 --> 18:00.380
Your father hated
when you did that.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.848
Well, he shouldn't
have died

18:01.881 --> 18:04.151
and left this fine
establishment to me then.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.553
Besides, this is for you.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.889
Clearly on some kind of
sticky wicket. So do tell.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.891
What's the
problem?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.694
The problem is
Mother hardly knows this man.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.429
And there's something off
about him

18:16.463 --> 18:18.265
I can't quite put my finger on.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.832
I'm just worried that he's...

18:19.866 --> 18:22.602
taking advantage of her
in some way.

18:22.635 --> 18:23.903
What do you want me to do
about it?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.872
Check him out.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.574
(scoffs)
You know people,

18:27.607 --> 18:30.710
Angus. Find out who he is,
where he comes from.

18:32.579 --> 18:33.880
Please.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.184
All right.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.718
I can see you're
upside-down about this.

18:38.751 --> 18:39.752
I'll do what I can.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.223
Got something for me?
I do.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.225
It's POW!-Nog.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.859
It's-it's eggnog
meets Caf-POW!

18:46.893 --> 18:49.196
And it's my first batch
of the season.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.298
Something about the case.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.369
I can stand here all day.

18:56.403 --> 18:59.739
("Joy to the World" playing)

19:01.308 --> 19:02.942
Mm-hmm.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.577
You have a little, um...

19:05.712 --> 19:07.547
Never mind. Moving on.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.650
So, I examined Captain
Green's computer.

19:10.683 --> 19:11.951
He had an account
with a ridesharing service

19:11.984 --> 19:13.686
called HomeStretch.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.522
But they have
no record

19:15.555 --> 19:17.390
of a pickup request
the night of the murder.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.792
Well, someone picked him up.
Yeah, it looks like his account
was infected

19:19.826 --> 19:22.629
with a worm that
intercepted the request

19:22.662 --> 19:24.331
and then sent it
to a third party.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.832
Probably the killer.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.500
Can you trace it?
I didn't trace that.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.269
But I did trace
something else just

19:29.302 --> 19:31.238
as interesting. Take a look.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.972
Captain Green
made a cell phone call

19:33.005 --> 19:35.308
right when he left
Ducky's house.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.644
To who?
To whom, Jethro.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.911
Oh, good.
My tissue samples.

19:38.945 --> 19:39.946
Fridge, please.
Whatever.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.681
To whom?
Captain Green called

19:41.714 --> 19:44.551
a cell phone
registered to a...

19:44.584 --> 19:46.986
Balthazar Kilmeany.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.222
(clattering)

19:50.757 --> 19:52.492
What did you say?

19:52.525 --> 19:55.695
Balthazar Kilmeany.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.531
Yeah. You know him?

19:58.565 --> 20:01.234
Yes.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.736
He was my mother's fiancé.

20:16.783 --> 20:20.920
Have you found out anything more
about this Balthazar?

20:20.953 --> 20:23.756
No. Cell was registered
to a post office box.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.592
We're still looking.
We were hoping

20:25.625 --> 20:27.594
you might be able to shed
a little light

20:27.627 --> 20:28.995
before I had to brief SecDef.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.930
You did know the man,
after all.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.932
No, I-I don't
think I did.

20:32.965 --> 20:36.703
This Balthazar Kilmeany
simply cannot possibly be

20:36.736 --> 20:37.937
the man I knew.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.939
He would be over
100 years old.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.875
Duck, got to ask.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.446
Okay.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.449
My mother...

20:49.482 --> 20:51.818
met a man in Majorca.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.521
They fell
madly in love.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.789
Became engaged.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.991
I didn't
trust the man,

20:59.025 --> 21:01.394
and so I... I had a friend

21:01.428 --> 21:03.996
run a background check.

21:04.030 --> 21:07.300
And I gather that your fears
were justified?

21:07.334 --> 21:09.869
And then some.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.339
BALTHAZAR:
So the Scotsman
replies very quickly,

21:12.372 --> 21:13.973
"I'd like to be shot first."

21:14.006 --> 21:15.642
(Victoria laughs)

21:15.675 --> 21:17.844
Oh, my...

21:17.877 --> 21:19.312
Tell another one, Balthy.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.146
Oh, please.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.884
(clears throat)
Actually, Ms. Mallard,

21:24.917 --> 21:26.819
I was, um, hoping
to get your opinion

21:26.853 --> 21:28.555
on this new bourbon bar
we're opening.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.691
Oh. It's a little early
for a tipple.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.761
But since you've twisted my arm.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.429
Ah!

21:36.463 --> 21:38.465
(piano playing
"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen")

21:46.706 --> 21:47.940
(chuckles)

21:47.974 --> 21:49.909
Your mother--
she does

21:49.942 --> 21:51.778
love her bourbon.
Matter of fact,

21:51.811 --> 21:52.945
we were planning,
for the wedding...

21:52.979 --> 21:54.514
There isn't going to be
a wedding.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.016
Oh, come, Donald, I...

21:57.049 --> 21:59.586
I know things are moving
rather quickly,

21:59.619 --> 22:01.988
and probably caught you
a bit off-guard.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.923
Let me be plain as a pikestaff.

22:03.956 --> 22:06.626
You are never
going to marry my mother.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.362
This isn't some kind of

22:09.396 --> 22:10.963
weird Oedipal thing, is it?

22:10.997 --> 22:13.466
Contrary to popular opinion,

22:13.500 --> 22:15.968
I'm actually very happy
my mother has fallen in love.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.671
Just not with a con man
such as yourself.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.139
I did
some checking.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.442
Balthazar Kilmeany
isn't your real name.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.010
It's an alias.

22:24.043 --> 22:27.714
Well, now, my mother will be
quite surprised to hear that.

22:27.747 --> 22:28.881
So will mine.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.717
Seems you have a history

22:30.750 --> 22:33.853
of hanging out in ritzy
resort areas like Majorca,

22:33.886 --> 22:36.122
bilking rich, older women
out of their money.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.827
Donald, I can explain.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.028
No, I doubt that very much.

22:42.061 --> 22:44.030
This isn't what you think.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.532
Right.

22:45.565 --> 22:49.402
And who am I to believe,
you or my lying eyes?

22:50.970 --> 22:52.705
Believe your eyes.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.006
You're right.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.543
It's all true.

22:56.576 --> 22:59.579
I have done all those things.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.481
But...

23:01.514 --> 23:03.015
this time it's...

23:03.049 --> 23:05.017
it's different.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.487
Yes, when I first
met your mother,

23:07.520 --> 23:09.622
I... I planned

23:09.656 --> 23:12.559
to steal from her, but...

23:12.592 --> 23:15.995
but then something
wonderful happened.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.131
I fell in love.

23:19.165 --> 23:21.968
For the first time
in my life.

23:22.001 --> 23:25.772
I could never hurt Victoria.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.808
She's my soul mate.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.047
And I know she feels
the same way.

23:44.056 --> 23:46.158
Listen to me carefully.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.227
You are to depart
England immediately.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.162
Tell my mother you have
to leave on business

23:50.196 --> 23:52.031
or tend to
a sick family member.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.866
Tell her whatever you like.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.768
But if you're not gone
by tomorrow, this file

23:55.802 --> 23:57.570
is going straight
to Scotland Yard.

23:57.604 --> 24:00.807
And you are going straight
to Wandsworth Prison, got it?

24:06.145 --> 24:09.081
That is a hell of
a story, Jethro.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.685
But I'm not surprised.

24:12.719 --> 24:14.687
All Ducky stories are good.

24:14.721 --> 24:17.189
Mallet.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.158
But what if
he's wrong?

24:19.191 --> 24:21.060
What if this
new Balthazar

24:21.093 --> 24:23.062
is the same guy that was
schtupping his mother,

24:23.095 --> 24:24.531
back for revenge?

24:24.564 --> 24:25.898
At 109?

24:25.932 --> 24:27.767
Some guys can hold a grudge.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.903
Or maybe his son,
with the same name.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.739
Either way,

24:32.772 --> 24:34.974
how does he fit into the case?

24:35.942 --> 24:37.109
Working on it.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.811
And who the hell is this guy?

24:44.717 --> 24:46.152
Okay.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.187
Fine.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.156
I got something else

24:50.189 --> 24:51.991
for you to do.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.192
Emily came
by today.

24:53.225 --> 24:56.128
I met her new
boyfriend.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.296
Nice kid.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.865
Nice looking.

24:58.898 --> 25:01.568
Just all-around...

25:01.601 --> 25:03.102
nice.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.639
But...

25:06.673 --> 25:09.275
I need you to process this
for prints.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.077
I need my own
background check.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.679
I could do it myself, but

25:12.712 --> 25:14.180
I'm not back with the Bureau,

25:14.213 --> 25:15.281
so I can't
access their lab.

25:15.314 --> 25:17.183
Oh, come on.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.818
It's against the law, Tobias.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.152
I'm not asking you
to break the law.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.055
I am asking you to
stretch it a little.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.891
Look what happened
to Ducky's mother.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.593
You can't be too
careful when you're...

25:28.227 --> 25:29.228
What?

25:34.867 --> 25:35.868
What is that?

25:39.639 --> 25:41.273
That's a termite.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.079
Who are you calling?
My cousin.

25:47.113 --> 25:48.114
He's an exterminator.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.949
Got to nip this in the bud.

25:49.982 --> 25:52.652
You let this go too far,
he might tent the whole house.

25:52.685 --> 25:55.021
And there goes
my microfiber couch.

25:55.054 --> 25:58.024
That guy Emily's dating--
what'd you say he was studying?
Yeah, Mikey,

25:58.057 --> 26:00.092
it's Tobias. I got an
Alpha Priority emergency here.

26:00.126 --> 26:01.193
Can you hold?
(phone rings)

26:01.227 --> 26:03.329
Yes, I can hold.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.297
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
(McGee speaking indistinctly)

26:05.331 --> 26:08.100
Uh, where?

26:08.134 --> 26:10.136
Yeah, okay, I'll meet you there.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.805
Where you going?

26:12.839 --> 26:16.308
No word back on the gardener
BOLO yet, but Metro PD

26:16.342 --> 26:17.844
found the guy who
drove Captain Green

26:17.877 --> 26:19.345
to Ducky's old house
in Rock Creek Park

26:19.378 --> 26:21.213
after a couple complained
about him following him.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.182
Okay. So who is he?
Well...

26:23.215 --> 26:25.251
refused to say. Didn't have ID,
but Metro's

26:25.284 --> 26:27.286
running his prints now.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.357
BISHOP: So tell us
why you were in the park.

26:31.390 --> 26:34.126
I was simply enjoying the day.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.962
That a crime?
No.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.029
But murder is.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.370
I say he knows our captain.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.739
What happened?
What happened was,

26:46.773 --> 26:49.041
Captain Green
was selling government data.

26:49.075 --> 26:50.209
And we think you were buying it.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.079
Excuse me?

26:53.112 --> 26:55.882
When the feds started
closing in, you took Green out.

26:55.915 --> 26:58.250
Are you out of your minds?
Oh,

26:58.284 --> 27:00.787
said the man who was
picked up for stalking

27:00.820 --> 27:03.389
at, uh, Rock Creek Park
an hour ago.

27:03.422 --> 27:06.125
I wasn't stalking anybody.
I was doing my job.

27:06.158 --> 27:08.194
What job?

27:08.227 --> 27:11.263
Yes, I was tailing the guy
in the park.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.165
I'm a private investigator

27:13.199 --> 27:15.935
and I was hired by his wife
to follow him.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.104
And Captain Green?
He hired me two weeks ago.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.105
For what?
To find out
anything I could

27:19.138 --> 27:21.974
about the name
Balthazar Kilmeany.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.277
And?

27:25.311 --> 27:28.080
All I could find was an ad
taken out in the personals

27:28.114 --> 27:31.818
from six years ago.
Some lady named Victoria Mallard

27:31.851 --> 27:33.820
took it out.
I guess she's looking for

27:33.853 --> 27:35.421
this Balthazar guy, too.

27:35.454 --> 27:38.691
We went to her house,

27:38.725 --> 27:40.960
heard she had died years ago.
It was a dead end.

27:40.993 --> 27:44.330
I don't know why
Green was looking for this guy.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.332
And I suppose
you don't know anything

27:46.365 --> 27:48.234
about Captain Green's
murder, either?

27:48.267 --> 27:49.368
No.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.037
But, as it turns out,

27:51.070 --> 27:52.371
I think I might be able

27:52.404 --> 27:54.373
to help you.
How?

27:54.406 --> 27:56.909
Green gave me
a hard drive to hold.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.410
For safekeeping.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.413
He called it
an insurance policy

28:01.447 --> 28:03.916
in case anything
ever happened to him.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.920
I'd say something's
happened to him.

28:07.954 --> 28:10.857
All right, McGee and Abby
are analyzing the drive now.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.292
But I got a copy of the ad

28:13.325 --> 28:14.326
that Ducky's mother
took out.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.427
Personal ad,
local newspaper.

28:15.461 --> 28:16.929
Just reads like

28:16.963 --> 28:18.364
a lonely old lady
looking for her

28:18.397 --> 28:20.132
long-lost love.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.433
No offense.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.770
None taken.
Apparently that's exactly

28:23.803 --> 28:25.371
what my mother was.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.139
You knew about this?
No. In fact,

28:27.173 --> 28:30.209
I'm shocked that she had
the wherewithal to place it,

28:30.242 --> 28:32.912
considering the progression
of her Alzheimer's.

28:32.945 --> 28:35.514
I can only surmise
she was

28:35.547 --> 28:39.518
thinking of happier times
and trying to recapture them.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.220
Which meant trying to find

28:41.253 --> 28:43.422
her old fiancé.

28:43.455 --> 28:45.324
TORRES:
I get that, but

28:45.357 --> 28:47.526
why the hell was Captain Green
looking for this guy?

28:47.559 --> 28:49.395
Whatever the reason, he was
never going to find him. I just

28:49.428 --> 28:53.232
spoke to Interpol. Turns out
the name Balthazar Kilmeany

28:53.265 --> 28:54.801
been popping up
all over the world--

28:54.834 --> 28:56.302
bank accounts,
property deeds,

28:56.335 --> 28:57.503
but nothing tied down
to an actual person.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.038
TORRES:
It's a fake identity.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.973
I've backstopped
about 15 of these.

29:01.007 --> 29:02.308
Well, my contact
believes this one

29:02.341 --> 29:04.243
was specifically created
to launder money.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.344
Created by who?
REEVES: Unknown.

29:05.377 --> 29:06.345
Looks like half a dozen people

29:06.378 --> 29:07.313
used this over the years.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.081
Your mother's fiancé

29:09.115 --> 29:11.383
was one of a list of con men
who used the same alias.

29:11.417 --> 29:14.186
Well, perhaps Captain Green was
using it to launder the money

29:14.220 --> 29:17.056
that he made from selling
classified data.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.825
Well, there's a funny thing
about that.

29:18.858 --> 29:19.892
I just finished analyzing

29:19.926 --> 29:21.427
Green's hard drive.

29:21.460 --> 29:22.862
Captain Green

29:22.895 --> 29:24.396
didn't steal
any classified data.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.433
Then why's he dead?

29:38.845 --> 29:41.380
The insurance policy that Green
gave the P.I. to hold onto

29:41.413 --> 29:43.983
contained internal DoD
security footage.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.052
BISHOP:
They clearly show he was
nowhere near a computer

29:46.085 --> 29:47.920
during the time
when classified data was stolen.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.055
McGEE:
He was set up.

29:49.088 --> 29:50.556
By who?

29:50.589 --> 29:52.825
Someone that got ahold of his
password, logged in remotely.

29:52.859 --> 29:55.061
Even the Crimean bank account--
it's a setup.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.595
It's in Green's name,
but he didn't open it.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.197
Person that opened the account
is named...

29:58.230 --> 30:01.267
Balthazar Kilmeany.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.035
Green knew all this?
McGEE:
It's all on the hard drive.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.904
So why didn't he
go to the police?

30:04.937 --> 30:07.006
I mean, why go after
this guy himself?

30:07.039 --> 30:08.307
Why are you asking me?
Go find out.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.942
On it.
And find that gardener.

30:09.976 --> 30:12.945
He ran for a reason.
He knows something.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.014
I'll check the BOLO.
Gibbs.

30:16.348 --> 30:17.583
What?

30:17.616 --> 30:20.319
Aw. You got to
be kidding me.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.354
This is the worst possible time.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.494
No, you know what?

30:28.527 --> 30:30.496
I'm all right.

30:30.529 --> 30:32.564
Never mind. It's good.

30:32.598 --> 30:34.033
Thank you.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.404
Uh, we get a break
in the case?

30:38.437 --> 30:39.872
(laughs)

30:39.906 --> 30:41.974
Exterminator.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.243
My house has to be tented.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.245
Termites.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.981
(laughs)

30:53.519 --> 30:55.521
(elevator bell dings)

31:02.128 --> 31:04.030
Hey, Ducky.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.432
Got a sec? Abby dug up

31:06.465 --> 31:08.500
the old paperwork
from your mom's ad.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.536
And I thought
you might like a copy?

31:10.569 --> 31:12.571
Thank you.
And, um,

31:12.604 --> 31:15.107
the local LEOs found
your old gardener.

31:15.141 --> 31:16.575
Torres is bringing him in now.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.244
Again, my thanks.

31:18.277 --> 31:21.914
Ducky, is there anything
you want to talk about?

31:21.948 --> 31:24.616
No. I've... talked enough.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.186
(sniffles)

31:33.092 --> 31:35.494
You made the right decision.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.596
Did I?
Yes.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.666
Mother's fiancé was bent
as a two-headed penny.

31:40.699 --> 31:43.002
A con man, a thief.

31:43.035 --> 31:46.038
Even thieves fall in love.

31:46.072 --> 31:48.307
Oh, rubbish.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.043
Making him leave was
the right call.

31:51.077 --> 31:54.113
And, might I add, so is whatever
you're doing with your skin.

31:54.146 --> 31:55.982
You look fantastic.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.450
I'm not really
complimenting myself, am I?

31:58.484 --> 32:00.186
Oh, just take it.

32:00.219 --> 32:03.990
Look, that man would have
broken Mother's heart.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.158
It's as simple as that.
We don't know that.

32:06.192 --> 32:07.559
And if you had
told her the truth,

32:07.593 --> 32:09.061
she would've been mortified

32:09.095 --> 32:10.562
that she fell in love
with a sod like that.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.065
It wasn't our decision to make.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.233
But we made it.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.035
Why argue the toss now?

32:16.068 --> 32:18.170
Because she was
in love with him!

32:18.204 --> 32:21.373
And apparently
she never let him go!

32:21.407 --> 32:23.175
I took away

32:23.209 --> 32:27.113
her one and only chance
of finding true love.

32:27.146 --> 32:31.650
And she ended up alone
the rest of her life.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.153
So have you.

32:34.186 --> 32:38.090
Which is why I understand
exactly what I took from her.

32:38.124 --> 32:43.295
And it's something with which
I just simply cannot make peace.

32:43.329 --> 32:47.633
(clock chiming, playing tune)

32:47.666 --> 32:51.470
Something's happened to
Balthazar, I just know it has!

32:51.503 --> 32:52.738
Mother, please calm down.
No.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.740
A week ago,
we were planning a trip

32:54.773 --> 32:58.077
to Kenya to swim with hippos,
and now he's gone.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.279
Really?
Yes. He-he left a note for me.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.081
Said he had to leave town
on business,

33:02.114 --> 33:04.016
but would check in with me
every day.

33:04.050 --> 33:06.052
Well, how long has it been
since you heard from him?

33:06.085 --> 33:07.186
Two weeks!

33:07.219 --> 33:08.754
Perhaps he just needed a break.

33:08.787 --> 33:11.123
Things were moving
rather quickly.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.092
That's what happens
when you meet your soul mate.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.793
Soul mate? Mother,
you'd only just met him.

33:14.826 --> 33:18.697
Don't you patronize me,
Donald Horatio Mallard!

33:18.730 --> 33:20.699
I've been around the block.

33:20.732 --> 33:23.035
I know what love is.

33:23.069 --> 33:27.139
Or thought I did...
until I met Balthazar.

33:27.173 --> 33:30.209
For the first time in my life,

33:30.242 --> 33:32.678
I was truly happy.

33:32.711 --> 33:35.381
And I know he was, too.

33:35.414 --> 33:39.085
And now he's gone.

33:39.118 --> 33:42.054
(crying):
I don't know what happened.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.255
(crying)

33:46.158 --> 33:48.527
Oh, what am I gonna do?

33:48.560 --> 33:51.363
Mother, I have
something to tell you.

33:51.397 --> 33:54.233
As you know, I've volunteered
to serve at the Jalozai

33:54.266 --> 33:57.636
Refugee Camp at the
border of Pakistan.
Oh, yes, I know.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.605
And your timing
is dreadful, as usual.

33:59.638 --> 34:03.109
But when my tour is up, I
planned on moving to America.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.411
Oh, doesn't that just
take the cake!

34:05.444 --> 34:07.779
And I'd like you
to come with me.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.715
To America?

34:09.748 --> 34:14.320
Where they mix bacon with syrup?

34:14.353 --> 34:16.322
Have you lost your mind?!

34:16.355 --> 34:18.224
Come with me, Mother.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.797
You're a good boy, Donnie.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.435
You always were.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.505
But I don't know anyone
in America.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.641
I'm not getting any younger.

34:35.674 --> 34:38.844
I don't have the energy
to move to a new country.

34:38.877 --> 34:41.713
And besides,
where would I live?

34:43.282 --> 34:45.451
With me.

34:48.354 --> 34:50.256
You're welcome
to stay with me

34:50.289 --> 34:53.559
as long as you need
to get settled.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.228
(computer beeps, trills)

35:05.337 --> 35:06.572
(computer beeps)

35:06.605 --> 35:08.307
Tell us where you went
after that.

35:13.779 --> 35:16.915
McGEE:
Found this on the App Store.
Mr. Rin's Garden School.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.617
What did I miss?

35:18.650 --> 35:21.753
Well, your former gardener's
about to wet himself.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.522
McGEE:
Did you code that yourself?

35:23.555 --> 35:25.891
They don't think he's involved
in all this, do they?

35:25.924 --> 35:27.559
RIN:
I've taken a few courses online.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.861
Oh, he's hiding something.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.563
And we're running out
of suspects.

35:31.597 --> 35:33.432
McGEE:
Must have been one hell
of a class.

35:33.465 --> 35:36.602
They teach you how to steal
passwords... Balthazar?

35:36.635 --> 35:38.437
We know that you used
Captain Green's password

35:38.470 --> 35:40.206
to steal classified data.

35:40.239 --> 35:42.841
Fake the identity,
launder the cash.

35:42.874 --> 35:45.244
When Captain Green caught
on, you had him killed.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.645
I have no idea
what you're talking about!

35:46.678 --> 35:48.280
Getting anything wrong,
just correct us.

35:48.314 --> 35:51.217
I can't. I promised.
Who?

35:51.250 --> 35:53.485
What'd you promise?
Donald can never, ever know!

35:53.519 --> 35:57.389
Know what?!
That his mother
and I were lovers.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.460
Did he just say
what I think he said?

36:01.493 --> 36:03.362
Yes, he did.

36:09.368 --> 36:10.969
Go on.

36:11.002 --> 36:14.506
We became an item in the '90s.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.442
But Bubbles made me swear

36:16.475 --> 36:18.410
to never, ever say anything
to Donnie.

36:18.444 --> 36:20.712
Bubbles?

36:22.381 --> 36:23.915
I was 25 years
her junior

36:23.949 --> 36:27.753
and not English, and for
Victoria, that was scandalous.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.988
If you and Ducky's mother
were such a hot item,

36:30.021 --> 36:32.324
why did she take out an ad
in the paper

36:32.358 --> 36:34.293
looking for an old fiancé?

36:34.326 --> 36:36.895
She didn't. I did.

36:36.928 --> 36:39.898
In her delirium at the end,

36:39.931 --> 36:42.734
she thought she saw
Balthazar in the street.

36:42.768 --> 36:46.738
So she asked me
to place an ad to find him.

36:46.772 --> 36:49.375
I didn't feel slighted.

36:50.609 --> 36:53.211
(sighs)
She wasn't well.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.615
And I would have done anything
for her.

36:59.017 --> 37:01.587
Look, you don't have
to believe me.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.355
She wrote it all down
in her diary,

37:03.389 --> 37:04.956
and she gave it to me
when she got sick.

37:04.990 --> 37:08.594
And that's where I was going
after your agents came

37:08.627 --> 37:10.296
to see me. All
of their questions

37:10.329 --> 37:12.331
about Balthazar just
made me nervous.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.833
So then I went home to make sure
that the diary was still hidden.

37:14.866 --> 37:15.801
Mm-hmm. Where?

37:15.834 --> 37:17.869
In the garage.
No.

37:17.903 --> 37:21.340
Where did Ducky's mother think
she saw Balthazar?

37:21.373 --> 37:22.874
Well, at the theater. Why?

37:25.344 --> 37:26.678
(distant horn honking)

37:26.712 --> 37:29.948
Well, that was
really awesome.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.351
Please. You hated it.

37:32.384 --> 37:35.053
But... thank you for
not complaining.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.423
I know it's not the same
without your dad.

37:37.456 --> 37:40.426
Just... I can't
believe he's gone.

37:40.459 --> 37:41.927
GIBBS:
You might not ever.

37:41.960 --> 37:45.797
I still wake up
every morning,

37:45.831 --> 37:48.500
and I think the same thing
about my dad.

37:48.534 --> 37:49.735
Hello, Agent Gibbs.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.803
Do you have news
about my father's case?

37:52.804 --> 37:54.773
Yeah.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.608
Yeah. Unfortunately, I do.

38:06.518 --> 38:10.456
So Logan was the nephew

38:10.489 --> 38:13.959
of the man my mother knew
as Balthazar Kilmeany?

38:13.992 --> 38:15.427
Her last Christmas,

38:15.461 --> 38:17.796
she thought she saw her fiancé
at the theater.

38:17.829 --> 38:20.832
Oh. Well, there's a resemblance.

38:20.866 --> 38:23.402
(chuckles)
My mother did love
The Nutcracker.

38:23.435 --> 38:24.670
BISHOP:
He apparently came

38:24.703 --> 38:26.505
from a family of con men.

38:26.538 --> 38:29.608
The Balthazar identity was like
a family heirloom

38:29.641 --> 38:32.010
passed down
to anyone who needed it.

38:32.043 --> 38:34.112
And Logan was the next in line.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.715
Claims his marriage
to Green's daughter was real.

38:36.748 --> 38:39.351
But when he saw an opportunity
to make some money,

38:39.385 --> 38:41.553
he just... couldn't say no.

38:41.587 --> 38:46.525
And he started selling
classified data to this man.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.093
GIBBS:
Captain Green suspected.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.861
He tried to handle it himself.

38:49.895 --> 38:52.464
The buyer got nervous when
he saw Green poking around, so

38:52.498 --> 38:55.367
he posed as his driver at
the theater and killed him.

38:55.401 --> 38:57.603
Interpol just picked him up
on his way to Moscow.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.104
Logan claims he had

38:59.137 --> 39:01.607
no idea his father-in-law
was in danger,

39:01.640 --> 39:04.543
um, and we think
he's telling the truth.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.445
It's a tragedy indeed,

39:06.478 --> 39:09.581
but one with a silver lining.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.550
I've been reading this.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.585
My mother's diary.

39:13.619 --> 39:17.122
Mr. Rin makes quite
an appearance.

39:17.155 --> 39:19.090
Yikes.
Yes, I've been

39:19.124 --> 39:21.793
bleeding from my eyeballs
all morning. (chuckles softly)

39:21.827 --> 39:27.599
However, the good news is,
I learned something wonderful.

39:27.633 --> 39:33.572
It appears my mother was having
a romance with Mr. Rin.

39:33.605 --> 39:36.074
And to think I was
worried that I had...

39:36.107 --> 39:38.644
Well, suffice to say, knowing

39:38.677 --> 39:41.780
that my mother spent
the last years of her life,

39:41.813 --> 39:44.916
well, head-over-heels in love
is the best Christmas present

39:44.950 --> 39:47.553
I could possibly have.
BISHOP:
Well,

39:47.586 --> 39:49.988
actually, we have one more.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.993
Hmm?
(elevator doors open)

39:55.026 --> 39:57.963
Hello, Donald.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.931
Mr. Rin!

40:01.132 --> 40:03.669
(laughter)

40:03.702 --> 40:08.173
Please, call me Takumi.
(laughs)

40:08.206 --> 40:10.141
Uh-oh.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.844
Sorry. We didn't want
to miss the reunion.

40:12.878 --> 40:15.581
Well, come on in.
It's only just started.

40:15.614 --> 40:17.683
(singsongy):
And we brought
presents!

40:17.716 --> 40:18.784
Happy Christmas Eve!

40:18.817 --> 40:20.619
Cookies.
Wow!

40:20.652 --> 40:22.954
*

40:22.988 --> 40:24.956
BISHOP:
Thank you.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.992
(indistinct chatter)

40:30.195 --> 40:33.532
Duck.
Duck.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.734
ALL:
Ducky!

40:43.575 --> 40:45.076
* We wish you
a merry Christmas... *

40:45.110 --> 40:48.113
I thought maybe after dinner
we could open some gifts.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.916
Uh-huh.
And watch Rudolph.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.218
Mmm.
(sighs)

40:53.251 --> 40:55.086
Jack should be here soon.

40:55.120 --> 40:59.658
You mean the entomologist?

40:59.691 --> 41:02.093
Don't play dumb.
I know what he helped you do.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.729
What did we do?

41:03.762 --> 41:06.264
Bugged Gibbs' house,

41:06.297 --> 41:09.568
and pulled me out of summer camp
before the session was over.

41:09.601 --> 41:11.870
Summer camp?
Yeah.

41:11.903 --> 41:14.506
When does a guy ever get to hang
with a guy friend like that?

41:14.540 --> 41:15.874
Beer, late-night movies...

41:15.907 --> 41:17.275
Braiding each other's hair.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.277
Dad, you're a grown man.
Camp is over.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.613
Because you short-sheeted
the bed.

41:21.647 --> 41:24.683
I wanted you at home

41:24.716 --> 41:26.217
for Christmas.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.820
I missed you.

41:30.556 --> 41:32.290
I know.

41:32.323 --> 41:35.126
I missed you, too.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.796
(sighs)

41:40.799 --> 41:42.668
Truth be told,
I sort of got my fill

41:42.701 --> 41:44.803
of Gibbs. He's a horrible
conversationalist.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.772
(laughs)
And there are
only so many

41:46.805 --> 41:48.974
fireplace steaks and canned
beans you can eat before...

41:49.007 --> 41:51.577
(doorbell rings)

41:51.610 --> 41:53.144
Oh. Good.

41:53.178 --> 41:54.746
There's the entomologist.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.147
Be nice.
Of course.

41:56.181 --> 41:57.749
I really need to thank him.

41:57.783 --> 41:58.984
He was actually
the person who saved me

41:59.017 --> 42:00.786
from Leroy Jethro...

42:00.819 --> 42:04.723
Gibbs!

42:04.756 --> 42:07.793
What the hell
are you doing here?
Termites.
