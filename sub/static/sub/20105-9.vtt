00:03.128 --> 00:04.244
You're prosecuting Weckler?

00:04.463 --> 00:06.750
He confessed even though you
didn't have much hard evidence.

00:06.965 --> 00:07.671
You haven't heard?

00:07.883 --> 00:10.500
James Weckler hanged himself
in his cell this morning.

00:10.969 --> 00:14.337
Any idea who's going to be in charge of
the world's only zombie military force now?

00:14.556 --> 00:16.969

truthers meeting tomorrow night.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.282
(SCREECHING)

00:36.537 --> 00:40.531
That, boys and girls,
is what we're dealing with.

00:40.791 --> 00:45.001
Those of us sitting in this room are all
that's standing between an America we love,

00:45.170 --> 00:46.786
and a
zombie-controlled wasteland.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.413
Yes, sir.

00:48.632 --> 00:49.964
Whether they look like this.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.126
- Or this.
- MAN: God.

00:53.345 --> 00:56.304
- Oh, snap.
- Or like our honorable mayoral candidate,

00:57.140 --> 00:58.381
a secret zombie.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.387
What makes you think
he's a brain eater?

01:00.602 --> 01:02.343
Look at the facts.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.055
My brother worked down in
the basement lab at Max Rager.

01:05.274 --> 01:07.607
Baracus and all of the other
Chaos Killer victims

01:07.776 --> 01:09.642
are being experimented on
down in the lab.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.604
(LAUGHS) Hell, they say
as much in interviews.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.564
Well, they didn't say
they were zombies.

01:15.242 --> 01:19.156
Maybe not. But when me and my
brother Harley tried to visit Baracus,

01:19.371 --> 01:22.034
see if he'd take a little
involuntary blood pressure test,

01:22.249 --> 01:24.912
he had zombie guards
protecting him.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.999
So, they can just pass
as normal-looking?

01:28.213 --> 01:29.078
Sure can.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.831
Ask Billy Cook here.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.383
He's the guy you heard
on Chuck Burd's show.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.548
He saw it all go down
at the Max Rager party.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.300
It's true. Everyone
that walked in that party

01:42.144 --> 01:43.225
was just a normal person.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.266
But what I saw at the end?

01:48.025 --> 01:49.857
They were all
red-eyed monsters.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.058
If you're here,

01:51.528 --> 01:53.736
it means that we can tell from what
you've posted on the message boards

01:53.947 --> 01:58.032
you're ready to do more than hunker down
and try to merely survive a zombie outbreak.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.359
MAN: Right. Yeah.

01:59.578 --> 02:00.989
My brothers and me,

02:02.205 --> 02:04.663
we're all in.
We can't do it on our own.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.993
We need volunteers to keep tabs
on all of our suspected zombies.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.578
Starting with

02:11.465 --> 02:12.797
Tim Addis.

02:12.966 --> 02:13.831
I'll do it.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.258
Here you go, Quick Draw.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.628
- Sandy Coleman.
- MAN: I'll take that.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.427
So, yeah...

02:22.684 --> 02:24.676
The Scratching Post is
under new management.

02:24.895 --> 02:29.230
Now, it's likely some of you heard how a
couple members of the old regime were, um,

02:29.441 --> 02:31.433
terminated without notice.
But, uh,

02:31.652 --> 02:32.733
let me tell you this,

02:33.111 --> 02:36.730
as long as you keep this operation
as clean and tight as this roll up,

02:36.948 --> 02:38.280
you will be fine.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.699
Now, when I'm off attending
other business,

02:39.910 --> 02:41.822
Don E. here is my guy.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.573
What he says goes.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.906
Let's go make some money.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.993
Money, people! Let's make it!

02:51.338 --> 02:52.249
Don E...

02:57.219 --> 02:58.710
I'm kind of his guy.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.004
Uh-huh.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.802
I need you to keep
this burner somewhere safe.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.633
I need to be able
to reach you 24/7.

03:05.852 --> 03:09.186
Also, our new product
is finally ready.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.811
This has been soaking
for 20 days.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.690
That's twice as long as Ravi's
recipe calls for.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.612
I need you

03:20.867 --> 03:22.358
to take it for a trial run.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.487
- I'm not sure that's the best use of my time.
- I'll do it.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.581
- Fine.
- What is it?

03:30.252 --> 03:33.711
This blue juice makes zombie
visions longer and more intense.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.665
And if all goes according to plan,
it's going to make us a lot of money.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.127
Our test brain belonged
to 94-year-old Hoyt Carroll,

03:41.596 --> 03:43.929
a World War II waist gunner
and noted ladies' man.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.757
Ladies' man. Right on.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.553
I need to know how long
the visions last.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.726
And how soon
they start, post-ingestion.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.690
That's, uh, after you eat it.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.437
Okay, I need all you volunteers to
track your zombies' comings and goings

03:59.656 --> 04:00.612
and report back to me.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.656
And what are you gonna
do with that info?

04:02.868 --> 04:03.904
Something that can't
be ignored.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.535
Like what?

04:06.747 --> 04:07.578
Capture a zombie,

04:08.373 --> 04:10.831
starve it, broadcast it
on a live stream,

04:11.042 --> 04:13.625
and let the whole world see
the monster it becomes.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.669
- Right.
- Whoo!

was signing up for a kidnapping.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.535

04:59.925 --> 05:00.790

05:02.302 --> 05:03.338
Yeah, you do that.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.215
I'm a medical examiner.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.431
I used to work for the CDC,
but was fired

05:08.642 --> 05:11.680
for taking the possibility of
a zombie apocalypse seriously.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.012
I am on your side.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.312
What do you know about 'em?

05:15.774 --> 05:18.437
They've existed in Seattle
since the Boat Party Massacre.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.443
I examined several dead ones.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.437
I found brains in their
digestive tracts

05:23.657 --> 05:25.193
and something
under their fingernails.

05:25.408 --> 05:28.947
A substance which makes a
zombie's scratch highly contagious.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.279
Which means trying
to abduct one of them

05:31.498 --> 05:35.037
could start the very apocalypse
we are trying to prevent.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.413
You said you could help.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.333
I'm close to developing
a vaccine.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.085
One that will protect humans
from the zombie contagion.

05:42.968 --> 05:43.958
How close?

05:44.803 --> 05:47.762
Like, a few weeks, at most.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.924
According to Google,
Dr. Chakrabarti

05:51.184 --> 05:53.597
did, in fact,
work for the CDC.

05:53.812 --> 05:54.928
He is who he says he is.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.270
Okay.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.273
We start surveilling
all known zombies,

06:00.944 --> 06:03.311
but no contact while the
doctor works on the vaccine.

Sure. Thank you.

I'm just over there.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.183
Actually, their plan makes
a lot of sense.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.729
It's just, uh, premature.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.403
Kidnapping? That's not why
I showed up to this thing.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.276

I'm a photographer.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.196

- I've already got a Nessie and a Sasquatch.
- Oh.

Nope. This is.

- Am I strong enough to get up on her horse?

Then, yes, milady.

you come to a tavern.

than a gnome textile merchant inside,

we flee in terror.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.870
We do not flee in terror.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.422
We enter and approach the bar.

Fair warning, strangers,

08:02.023 --> 08:06.393
a Ranger by the name of
Longstockings was in here earlier,

08:06.611 --> 08:08.273

08:10.448 --> 08:11.564
Oh, he's choking.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.487
I'll give him ye old Heimlich.

I have a healing potion.

08:15.537 --> 08:18.701
Seriously, Dan. Longstockings
was asking about what?

08:19.958 --> 08:23.122
- Dan.
- I think this might really be happening.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.451
Holy crap.

Who knows CPR?

So, our Harley Johns followers
want to kidnap a zombie?

08:35.181 --> 08:37.264
Yes. But, happily,
not until I finish

08:37.475 --> 08:39.636
my utterly fictional
anti-zombie vaccine.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.186
- Quick thinking.
- It only buys us a couple of weeks.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.183
If they're willing to kidnap,
they're willing to murder.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.104
Well, they seem like people that would
execute a zombie family without blinking,

08:47.318 --> 08:49.059
but they didn't say anything
about the Tuttle-Reid case.

- Detective.
- What you got?

Vic keeled over in the middle of game
night after taking a swig of wine.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.602
One of the players called
it in at 2:07 a.m.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.104
- The other players still here?
- Yeah. This way.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.277
- A couple of them work at the station.
- Cops?

09:32.614 --> 09:33.604
Not exactly.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.329
See what I mean? Nerds.

Ah. Finally some

Weekly. Dan's been our DM
almost seven years now.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.222
- DM?
- Dungeon Master.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.516
Basically like a referee.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.309
He creates the details
in the adventure,

10:04.521 --> 10:07.480
and describes what the players
see and hear along the way.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.477

we encounter.

slipped it into the open wine bottle

11:34.110 --> 11:35.942
Any idea how much Dan earned?

11:36.446 --> 11:38.438
Master Dan didn't speak
of his wealth,

11:38.698 --> 11:40.815
but he must've been
doing quite well, indeed.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.696
He bought original cover art

11:42.911 --> 11:45.995
<i>to an Ogden Twiddlyhut a n d
the Valiant Men of Golden Glen.</i>

11:46.748 --> 11:49.365
I've seen those sell
for as much as $10,000.

11:49.584 --> 11:52.668
You know, that's not listed
in our crime scene inventory.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.166
It was hanging above
his fireplace last week.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.540
How long have you been
playing in Dan's campaign?

11:57.759 --> 11:59.045
Nigh unto seven years.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.343
Why were you all playing
first level characters?

12:01.554 --> 12:03.716
We were a party
of heroes and legends,

12:03.932 --> 12:06.640
but we were slain last week
in the Caverns of Varag.

12:06.851 --> 12:07.967
I know them well.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.766
Danger lurks behind
every stalactite.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.768
And how did you come
to meet your untimely demise?

12:15.944 --> 12:18.357
Darts dipped
in Pit Fiend venom.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.608
Our thief failed
to detect a trap.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.190
Your group was pretend-killed
by poison last week,

12:23.409 --> 12:27.073
and this week, your dungeon master
was real-life-killed by poison.

12:27.288 --> 12:30.281
Even though the Reverend Deodato
was wearing his Absorption Stone.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.787
He should've been
immune to poison.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.289
Who is Reverend Dodle Doodle?

12:35.505 --> 12:36.746
My 15-level cleric.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.755
LIV: (HITS TABLE) Fool!
You were in a cavern!

12:38.967 --> 12:41.584
- Your Absorption Stone would be worthless.
- So sayeth you.

12:41.803 --> 12:45.342
An Absorption Stone doesn't work
anywhere untouched by the sun.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.388
Uh... Sun Hammer.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.438
Is it safe to say your group
of heroes and legends

12:55.650 --> 12:57.607
had grown attached
to these old characters?

12:57.819 --> 13:00.436
Not attached enough to murder our
friend, if that's what you're asking.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.692
You can't imagine anyone
in your group seeking revenge

13:02.907 --> 13:04.694
for Dan
killing your characters?

13:04.951 --> 13:08.115
Well, I can't read
their minds, obviously.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.620
I'd put the odds
at one in 100.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.662
DAN: Your saving throw fails.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.088
You're all dead.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.417
- My saving roll is a three?
- It's called a Sun Hammer!

13:22.635 --> 13:25.594
- Are you on some kind of power trip!
- You're such a dick, Dan.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.012
I think we're good here.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.393
We'll call you back in
if we need anything more.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.187
(DOOR OPENS)

13:39.402 --> 13:40.392
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- What'd you see?

13:40.611 --> 13:43.604
The players all lost their
minds when their characters died.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.777
They were in Dan's face,
screaming at him.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.066
Who do we go to next?

13:48.995 --> 13:50.111
(DIE HITS TABLE)

13:50.330 --> 13:51.195
Zoe.

13:54.042 --> 13:58.127
"Time for vision to start after
eating brain, five minutes."

13:58.379 --> 14:00.291
"Length of vision, two hours."

14:01.007 --> 14:03.465
Penmanship, poor.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.668
- How was the ride?
- (EXHALES) Primo.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.594
I was in the middle
of a dogfight.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.973
Felt like I was shooting real
bullets. Shooting down Nazis.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.887
Damn, man. It was intense.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.389
Later, I'm getting
with this French girl,

14:15.605 --> 14:18.598
and she's nonstop into playing
Hide the Baguette, so I'm...

14:18.858 --> 14:20.315
Okay. Got it. Got it.

14:21.319 --> 14:24.153
Boys, we're gonna be rich.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.147
I'm gonna go to Shady Plots

14:27.367 --> 14:29.484
and see if there's any promising
new stiffs for blue-juicing.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.786
Meantime, you two start
hyping our new product.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.659
- You get all that booze put away?
- Can do.

14:55.853 --> 14:56.809
Cleared for takeoff.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.986
Oh, no.

15:18.668 --> 15:19.579
Oh...

15:19.794 --> 15:20.875
Hey.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.833
You know that stealing mail
is a federal offense, right?

15:24.048 --> 15:26.165
I was hiding mail.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.296
- Why are you...
- Opening my hate mail?

15:28.511 --> 15:31.174
Better question, why were
you hiding it from me?

15:31.389 --> 15:34.348
Because I'm kind
and empathetic.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.892
You know, I used to do
all right with girls.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.560
I suppose I can believe that.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.354
The only girls who don't avoid
me completely these days

15:41.566 --> 15:43.023
are the ones
out at Fillmore-Graves.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.066
And they're zombies, so that
doesn't do me much good.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.941
I may never be loved
or have sex again

15:48.156 --> 15:51.274
unless I move to some backwards
civilization that doesn't consume news.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.528
Like Pullman.

15:52.743 --> 15:53.654
Oh!

15:53.911 --> 15:54.992
Sick Wazzu burn.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.202
Wazzu?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.906
Washington State?

15:59.125 --> 16:01.538
Share my cultural touchstones!

16:01.794 --> 16:03.626
Ah! Listen to
this love letter.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.875
When they make
a Chaos Killer TV movie,

16:06.340 --> 16:08.627
I hope you watch it in hell
with your pal Ted Bundy.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.168
Wait, you didn't
actually kill anyone.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.471
Yeah, and the joke's on them. I'm
not pals with Ted Bundy either.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.808
Ah! This one wishes I'd been blown
to bits in the Max Rager explosion.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.887
This one wants my future family
kidnapped, so I know how it feels.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.563
Enough, Major.
Stop torturing yourself!

16:23.774 --> 16:24.764
This one

16:25.568 --> 16:26.900
says, uh,

16:28.196 --> 16:30.904
- I didn't do it.
- Really?

16:31.741 --> 16:35.405
"I know how crazy it must be to get a
letter like this from a total stranger."

16:35.661 --> 16:38.119
"But I was also accused
of something I didn't do."

16:38.331 --> 16:41.995
"If you ever need a sympathetic
ear, I've got two. Shawna."

16:45.254 --> 16:46.620
Monster!

16:47.465 --> 16:49.331
She must've done
whatever she was accused of.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.464
Well, she included
her phone number.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.295
- Mmm.
- And this.

16:59.018 --> 16:59.758
She's cute.

17:02.313 --> 17:06.353
So I read the report you wrote on James
Weckler as his prison psychiatrist.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.900
What were you treating him
for exactly, Dr. Danforth?

17:09.111 --> 17:10.818
Apparitional hallucinations.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.321
He saw ghosts. Well, a ghost.

17:14.867 --> 17:15.903
Of his deceased wife.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.402
I guess it makes sense he'd

17:18.621 --> 17:20.988
go looking for
comfort elsewhere.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.416
- How do you mean?
- His supposed murder victim was a dominatrix.

17:25.670 --> 17:26.660
James started out as a client.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.457
(SCOFFS) No way.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.166
James lost all interest in sex
after his wife died.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.759
He simply couldn't do anything
his wife didn't approve of.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.587
She most certainly would
not have approved

17:36.847 --> 17:39.464
of him spending his limited
funds on a dominatrix.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.265
CLIVE: Man,
this really takes me back.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.812
I didn't know you
were into comics.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.514
<i>Just The Flash.</i>

17:47.733 --> 17:51.101
His dad didn't have
much faith in him, either.

17:51.737 --> 17:52.853
Aw...

17:52.863 --> 17:54.604
I'm messing with you.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.481
He was super-fast
and he had a cool name.

18:02.707 --> 18:03.948
Liv, look at this.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.454
<i>The Ogden Twiddlyhut thingy.</i>

18:06.669 --> 18:08.786
The one missing from the
inventory of Dan's apartment.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.288
On sale for $5,000.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.004
Keep going.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.888
When you finish down there, you
can take me to second breakfast.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.059
(ZOE CHUCKLING)

18:32.862 --> 18:33.898
ZOE: Sorry. (SIGHS)

18:34.113 --> 18:36.981
Guy needed a moment to say goodbye
to his entire comic book collection.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.361
We just had a few
more questions. Starting with,

18:39.577 --> 18:41.739
why is Dan's missing
cover art here, for sale?

18:41.996 --> 18:44.033
This is the first time
Lady Wellin Marsapple,

18:44.248 --> 18:45.784
<i>hero of
the Ogden Twiddlyhut series,</i>

18:46.000 --> 18:47.741
has ever appeared in print.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.501
And who says it's missing?
I won it off Dan in a bet.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.997
You had five grand
to lose in a bet?

18:53.007 --> 18:55.545
Or maybe you didn't bet cash.

18:55.801 --> 18:59.636
Maybe you bet some erotic
cosplay involving Halfling feet.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.222
Did you guys talk to Jimmy?

19:03.434 --> 19:05.426
Dan and I hadn't been
sleeping together long.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.726
We tried to keep it a secret.

19:06.937 --> 19:10.897
But I think that Jimmy saw
a naughty text I sent to Dan.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.770
So, you and Dan?

19:13.486 --> 19:17.696
It's the way he wielded all that
power. Oh! It was intoxicating.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.694
Why would Jimmy care if that's
how you felt about Dan?

19:20.910 --> 19:23.197
Well, I can tell when a guy's
got a crush on me.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.278
Like my character,
I'm pretty intuitive.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.374
I wouldn't say I had a crush.

19:29.585 --> 19:32.328
That's funny, given what we
found in your bag.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.373
Seeing the sketch pad, Jimmy's
eyes dart back and forth.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.458
Guilt etched on his face.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.921
- This is very creative.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.728
Liv saves against upchucking.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.823
And here's you

20:03.285 --> 20:04.401
and Zoe.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.868
- Yeah.
- Did you realize Zoe and Dan were sleeping together?

20:10.376 --> 20:11.742
Were you jealous of Dan?

20:13.003 --> 20:16.838
I wonder how far you'd go to
win the object of your obsession.

20:18.676 --> 20:21.134
You wanna talk about obsession?
You should check out Diego's back.

20:24.098 --> 20:27.591
How long after you got this did
you learn Zoe was sleeping with Dan?

20:27.810 --> 20:29.176
Not long enough.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.727
Steve knew, too.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.683
And he's really into Zoe.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.309
Where did Steve
put his tattoo?

20:34.525 --> 20:35.936
(SCOFFS) It's not
about his ink.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.986
<i>It's his whole Boys Don't Cry
- era Robert Smith thing.</i>

20:39.238 --> 20:41.104
As he is, so has he ever been.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.360
No. He used to be a blond.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.033
Then he found out
Zoe was a Twihard,

20:45.244 --> 20:47.531
and then he
became Vampire Steve.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.000
Diego told us
you did all this

20:56.255 --> 20:57.496
to get with Zoe.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.502
I came to vampires
of my own accord.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.509
It is but one of many interests
I happen to share with Zoe.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.131
Name another.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.587
Graphic novels.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.677
Especially those
pertaining to vampires.

21:07.892 --> 21:10.054
And yet she
chose someone else.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.760
That must have
been frustrating.

21:12.021 --> 21:14.764
I think we may yet
be joined in holy union.

21:14.774 --> 21:15.981
Good luck with that.

21:16.192 --> 21:17.023
She's polyandrous,

21:17.234 --> 21:19.601
and would only stay married
until a hale child is born.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.688
Plus, you'd need to find
a unicorn to sacrifice.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.443
You don't know.
I could find a unicorn.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.149
I was talking about real life.

21:27.203 --> 21:27.989
BOTH: Oh.

21:28.496 --> 21:29.862
I think we're done here.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.364
Thank you, Steve. You can go.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.662
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- The veteran detective

21:38.881 --> 21:40.497
closes his notepad in defeat,

21:40.716 --> 21:43.834
as another suspect slips
through his fingers.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.053
Any of these guys feel
like a murderer to you?

21:47.264 --> 21:49.677
None of them could draw blood
from a one-eyed kobold.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.308
Yeah, probably not.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.516
So we should do
some more digging.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.435
On a quest!

21:58.859 --> 22:02.899
One that will require a band of eager
souls, ready to test their mettle!

22:03.113 --> 22:06.026
Oh, no. You're talking about
playing the game, aren't you?

22:06.242 --> 22:07.528
Not just a game, good sir!

22:09.703 --> 22:10.659
A quest!

22:18.128 --> 22:21.542
You each start the campaign
with this many gold pieces.

22:24.385 --> 22:25.592
Twenty-seven gold pieces.

22:26.428 --> 22:29.421
I buy a small farm,
retire from adventuring.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.427
We've been diddling
around for two hours.

22:31.642 --> 22:32.974
We haven't actually
done anything.

22:33.143 --> 22:35.476
The creation of characters is
an essential part of the game.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.395
The actual point
of which is...

22:37.606 --> 22:40.394
Ooh! To trigger a vision to help
solve Dungeon Master Dan's murder.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.397
And who might this hirsute
stranger be? Introduce yourself.

22:45.948 --> 22:49.942
I am Mosco Bandywax of the Mirkwood
Bandywaxes. I'm a Halfling monk.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.526
And you, good sir?

22:51.537 --> 22:54.325
I am Sir Jay Esclaborne,
the human paladin.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.577
I don't remember yourcharacter
earning a knighthood.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.954
Oh, he's not a knight.
His first name is

22:59.169 --> 23:00.626
- Sirjay.
- Clever.

23:01.130 --> 23:01.916
I'll be watching you.

23:02.965 --> 23:03.921
And, you, madam?

23:05.509 --> 23:09.002
Hi. Uh, Brangelina Darksbane.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.629
Dark elf assassin.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.261
And who might
this stout fellow be?

23:15.978 --> 23:17.560
Earl. Dwarf fighter.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.144
Earl.

23:20.858 --> 23:22.815
Your story begins.

23:23.027 --> 23:25.770
Night falls on Astergrove.

23:26.030 --> 23:30.946
A hamlet on the frontier of the
human kingdom of Oosterglovia.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.901
You have never seen
each other before,

23:33.120 --> 23:36.909
but you find yourselves gathered in
the study of Georgie Fogglebottom.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.783
Last wizard east
of Gloomy Glen.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.498
You regard
each other uncomfortably.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.335
You regard
each other uncomfortably.

23:49.553 --> 23:52.512
Anyone know if Gloomy Glen
is a person or a place?

23:52.765 --> 23:54.882
Either way,
we should steer clear.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.224
Silence.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.552
A door opens in
the back of the room,

23:58.771 --> 24:01.605
and in walks
a small, unarmed woman

24:01.607 --> 24:02.723
holding a tea cup.

24:03.484 --> 24:04.520
She takes a sip,

24:06.278 --> 24:08.736
sits down,
and regards the group.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.445
This was the best I could do?

24:14.912 --> 24:16.073
Very well.

24:16.664 --> 24:19.828
You will kill the Lich
of Castle Rommscoddle.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.032
Lich, please!

24:21.752 --> 24:24.540
If you survive,
you will bring me his head.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.747
Then, and only then,

24:26.966 --> 24:30.585
will you be showered with
treasure befitting your efforts.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.465
Sounds dangerous, Mosco.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.430
Maybe you should go outside
and wait on your horse.

24:35.683 --> 24:36.890
What's a lich?

24:37.101 --> 24:39.468
Oh, a lich is
a terrible creature.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.553
A member of the undead.

24:42.147 --> 24:42.933
Gross!

24:43.148 --> 24:44.059
Kill it!
Kill the undead creature!

24:44.274 --> 24:45.185
Let me get this straight.

24:45.401 --> 24:49.145
So, we can go and find
Castle What's-His-Nuts,

24:49.822 --> 24:53.281
fight that thing, come back and we'll
get rewarded by this little old lady.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.899
Or we could just

24:55.077 --> 24:58.366
tie up this little old lady,
and take what we want now.

24:58.372 --> 25:00.739
Georgie begins
to mutter an incantation.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.745
(MUTTERING)

25:02.960 --> 25:05.919
Electricity fires from her
hands and strikes Brangelina.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.707
I try to dive in front
of the lightning bolt.

25:08.298 --> 25:11.291
Not on this day,
Ms. Fogglebottom! (GRUNTS)

25:11.510 --> 25:13.502
The lightning bolt has
already struck Brangelina.

25:13.721 --> 25:17.305
And Mosco lands on the ground
in front of her, looking foolish.

25:17.725 --> 25:19.341
Brangelina, you take...

25:20.686 --> 25:22.348
Thirty-four points damage.

25:22.563 --> 25:23.804
How many hit points
do you have?

25:26.650 --> 25:27.640
Thirty-four.

25:28.152 --> 25:29.484
Well. I'm dead.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.061
Uh, good luck with the lich.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.068
I bid thee, Fellowship
of the Dorks, goodnight.

25:34.283 --> 25:35.615
Oh, uh, I bind her wounds,

25:35.826 --> 25:37.658
begin mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.277
I move toward the light.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.074
Mosco won't give up.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.531
He keeps performing
chest compressions,

25:42.750 --> 25:46.460
keeps engulfing her mouth with his,
breathing his life force into hers!

25:46.670 --> 25:48.753
Live! Live, damn you!

25:50.257 --> 25:52.294
Brangelina's eyes
flutter open.

25:52.509 --> 25:53.374
(SIGHS)

25:57.848 --> 26:01.637
So, what say you,
Fellowship of the Dorks?

26:01.810 --> 26:04.644
Do you venture forth
and face the lich

26:04.855 --> 26:07.973
or stay and take
your chances with me?

26:13.781 --> 26:16.148
You enter the lich's quarters.
You hear muttering.

26:16.366 --> 26:19.825
You look up, and you see the lich
perched on a giant wooden chandelier.

26:20.037 --> 26:22.199
A fireball comes
hurtling down at you.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.530
CLIVE: Not good.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.202
LIV: Everyone takes
38 points damage.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.249
I'm dead.

26:27.461 --> 26:28.201
I bind her wounds.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.582
- I begin to...
- You're dead, too, Halfling.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.542
Your turn. What do you do?

26:32.758 --> 26:33.874
I swing with my long sword.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.467
At what? The Lich is 10 feet
above you.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.169
Well, throw something!

26:38.388 --> 26:40.095
Isn't there a stone somewhere?
Don't you have a dagger?

26:40.265 --> 26:41.597
- The dwarf!
- Say what?

26:41.809 --> 26:43.266
I throw the dwarf up
to the chandelier.

26:43.477 --> 26:44.263
I've got 18 strength.

26:44.478 --> 26:45.935
Does the dwarf allow
himself to be thrown?

26:46.730 --> 26:47.971
Yeah, fine.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.056
Sirjay throws Earl
up to the chandelier.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.567
He sticks the landing.
Earl, what do you do?

26:53.779 --> 26:58.114
I cleave this undead hellspawn in
twain with my Ax of the Dwarven Gods.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.904
You hit. Roll for damage.

27:05.582 --> 27:06.993
Booyah!

27:07.668 --> 27:10.536
How you like old Earl now,
you damn dirty lich?

27:10.796 --> 27:12.207
Is it dead?

27:12.464 --> 27:14.000
The lich looks badly wounded,

27:14.258 --> 27:15.749
but it launches itself
from the chandelier,

27:15.968 --> 27:18.460
and disappears from view as it
enters this antechamber.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.471
- We give chase!
- You go into the chamber, but the lich is gone.

27:21.682 --> 27:23.469
We search the room
for secret doors.

27:26.103 --> 27:27.139
ZOE: Dan?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.013
What the hell is this place?

27:30.232 --> 27:32.189
Has this room
always been here?

27:34.444 --> 27:36.561
- What did you see?
- A secret door.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.066
In Dan's apartment.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.272
Great, we're done here.

27:40.242 --> 27:41.323
No, we're not.

27:42.286 --> 27:44.027
Where is the lich?

27:48.458 --> 27:52.668
Boy, Georgie Fogglebottom's face
when I reached into my bag of holding

27:52.880 --> 27:56.214
and pulled out
that lich head, like... Yeah!

27:56.466 --> 27:58.002
What do you think
of them apples?

27:58.218 --> 27:59.208
I was there.

27:59.636 --> 28:02.174
I think playing all night
might've been a bad idea.

28:02.389 --> 28:07.054
Now that I've leveled up, I get two
attacks a round. That's gonna be tight.

28:07.269 --> 28:09.056
Hey, maybe we could
have a regular game.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.646
You could save a little Dan
brain, eat some every week.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.144
Clive, I saw that suit
of armor in my vision.

28:14.359 --> 28:17.022
It means the hidden door
to the secret room must be...

28:18.989 --> 28:20.025
There.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.719

maybe you know passwords.

LIV: Let's see.

28:54.942 --> 28:55.853
Apparently not.

29:02.532 --> 29:05.240
(SIGHS) I'm gonna tell
Devore what we found.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.488
Let's bring Zoe in tomorrow.

29:06.703 --> 29:08.160
See what she knew
about this room

29:08.372 --> 29:10.329
and Dan's interest
in Russian power plants.

29:12.042 --> 29:13.658
Yeah, I knew
about the secret room.

29:13.669 --> 29:14.955
How'd you find it?

29:15.170 --> 29:16.661
I went over to Dan's one day,

29:16.880 --> 29:18.712
heard music coming
from behind the wall,

29:18.924 --> 29:20.586
pushed on the bookcase
and there it was.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.584
She's done here.

29:23.762 --> 29:24.752
You can go.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.599
We're shutting down the case.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.467
- Why?
- The FBI stepped in.

29:31.687 --> 29:33.474
They're chasing
the cyber-crime angle.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.479
They think that your victim
might have been poisoned

29:35.691 --> 29:38.604
by a Russian agent to stop him
from hacking into their system.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.941
You know, that actually makes more
sense than any of our suspects.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.236
Let the Feds figure it out.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.780
They put Bozzio on it.

29:46.159 --> 29:49.072
- Bozzio?
- She was here a minute ago. You must've just missed her.

30:14.771 --> 30:15.887
What you looking for?

30:19.109 --> 30:19.940
You.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.943
You were right about Major
Lilywhite not being a mass murderer.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.075
Turns out he was
just a mass kidnapper.

30:32.456 --> 30:33.367
I've wanted to talk,

30:33.582 --> 30:38.953
but I figured after leaving a dozen
messages, the feeling wasn't mutual.

30:39.713 --> 30:41.625
Didn't seem like much
for me to say.

30:43.425 --> 30:44.336
Still doesn't.

30:47.054 --> 30:48.920
Unless you have
something new to add.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.096
How about this?

31:02.069 --> 31:03.651
I haven't stopped
thinking about you.

31:06.031 --> 31:09.866
I'm absolutely lost
without you.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.869
I meant about the case.

31:21.338 --> 31:22.624
My Uber is here.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.414
So, about this new case, uh,

31:26.885 --> 31:27.921
you like anyone for it?

31:29.388 --> 31:31.004
It's my case, Clive.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.220
And I'm afraid I can't trust
you with that information.

31:53.787 --> 31:55.198
Thanks for the brain mush.

31:55.664 --> 31:59.078
That is the first time anyone has
ever been thanked for that stuff.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.454
I just really want to be
myself for Justin tonight.

32:01.711 --> 32:04.704
No prob. I've got a freezer full
of Z-rations since I took the cure.

32:09.052 --> 32:12.511

Mr. Graves, I am so sorry about
Vivian. I greatly admired...

34:29.109 --> 34:30.690
Where do we stand on
the Tuttle-Reid investigation?

34:32.237 --> 34:35.400
(SOFTLY) Well, there's a group here in
Seattle that believes zombies escaped...

34:35.614 --> 34:37.572
From the Max Rager party.
I know. I've been briefed.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.777
Do you have hard evidence that can put
them away for murdering that zombie family?

34:41.663 --> 34:45.623
Not yet. But we've got someone on
the inside of Harley Johns' group.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.581
You do understand
the urgency, don't you?

34:47.793 --> 34:49.034
Zombie Island won't be
ready for some time.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.746
If D-Day happens before we're
ready, we could face extinction.

34:51.965 --> 34:52.955
I know this.

34:53.174 --> 34:56.463
My partner and I are risking our
careers to pursue it on our own time.

34:56.678 --> 34:58.010
It's not even our case.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.634
Your partner. A human
who you told about us.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.556
A human who risked
his life for zombies.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.383
Who gave up the woman
he loved for zombies.

35:04.644 --> 35:05.976
Yeah. That guy.

35:09.649 --> 35:10.765
That's a great dress.

35:11.818 --> 35:15.061

getting ready at home and coming with us.

came here straight from work.

pretend that this takes some effort?

35:57.530 --> 35:59.317
Auction begins
in 90 minutes.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.148
Until then, I'll keep Buck.

36:01.409 --> 36:02.399
You work the crowd.

36:02.619 --> 36:05.362
Oh, and, um, Chase wants to
meet you when you have a minute.

36:05.538 --> 36:08.656
- Who?
- Only the most important zombie on this planet.

36:08.875 --> 36:09.865
Right. Chase Graves.

Endeavor to impress.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.536
Okay. We'll see you soon.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.667
Hey, Daniel. Good to see you.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.339
- Thanks for coming out.
- Floyd.

36:17.550 --> 36:18.836
Sorry to interrupt
with an office matter,

36:19.052 --> 36:20.509
but you haven't
been around much lately.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.677
I just... I had a few
questions to run by you.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.755
- Yeah.
- On the Weckler case.

36:26.393 --> 36:27.554
The murdered dominatrix.

36:28.478 --> 36:29.343
We have a confession.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.937
There's something
fishy about it.

36:32.607 --> 36:35.850
My old boss used to tell me, "When you
win a case, get out of the courtroom."

36:37.529 --> 36:38.315
Let it go.

36:39.406 --> 36:40.647
Go have some fun, Peyton.

36:41.491 --> 36:42.402
Hey.

36:46.746 --> 36:50.535
- Well, that went over like a fart in a phone booth.
- What?

36:50.750 --> 36:52.537
I just tried to ask my boss about
the murdered dominatrix case,

36:52.752 --> 36:55.119
and he practically sprinted
away. Told me to drop it.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.379
Maybe that has something
to do with the fact

36:57.549 --> 37:00.633
that your boss was one
of the dominatrix's clients.

37:03.138 --> 37:04.049
Tell me everything.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.560
Hey, Doc. You got a minute?

37:17.026 --> 37:17.891
Uh...

37:20.488 --> 37:22.195
We caught ourselves a zombie.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.399
What happened to waiting
until I finish the vaccine?

37:24.617 --> 37:26.700
You know, we've got our eyes on
all those Chaos Killer zombies.

37:26.953 --> 37:29.115
They've got security details,
and those security details

37:29.122 --> 37:30.988
all end up
at the same underground bar.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.573
That's where we
found this one.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.954
Alone, wandering around.
Pretty out of it.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.752
Figured you'd
have tranquilizers.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.088
We need something to mellow out
this freak without killing it.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.543
You're sure you captured a...

37:43.219 --> 37:44.130
Zombie?

37:44.679 --> 37:45.465
Pretty damn sure.

(SHUTS OFF TV)

38:22.675 --> 38:23.756
Hey, there.

38:24.385 --> 38:27.002
Guess who's off duty and
ready to hobnob his ass off.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.212
Really?

38:28.431 --> 38:29.922
'Cause I'm all hobnobbed out.

38:30.141 --> 38:34.055
And I was hoping to take some
Fillmore-Graves soldier home, make love,

38:34.270 --> 38:38.856
and immediately fall asleep
without a follow-up conversation.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.148
- Check, please!

38:40.985 --> 38:41.771
Oh, look.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.899
It's your new boss chitchatting
with the zombie-who-would-be-mayor

38:45.114 --> 38:46.776
if he weren't such
a terrible candidate.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.365
Have you met
Chase Graves, yet?

38:48.576 --> 38:49.862
I'm not sure what I think.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.411
I have met him.
The day he arrived, in fact.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.615
He found out we stole
a six pack of Super Max,

38:55.834 --> 38:56.699
and he shot me in the chest.

38:56.918 --> 38:57.954
He did not.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.629
Liv, this is sweet, but there could
not be nothing worse for me than... Liv!

Stay down.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.435
- Take the boy. I've got Baracus.
- I'm on it.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.476
Floyd. Let Carey
take your boy.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.023
You need to calm down.

39:21.234 --> 39:22.190
CAREY: Let's go, Buck.

39:22.402 --> 39:23.563
Your dad's gonna be fine.

Eyes on me.

Deep, steady breaths.

39:28.616 --> 39:29.857
Miss, I'm a doctor!

Can you imagine what
that would be like,

40:21.878 --> 40:23.710
growing up with a father
that cares that much?

40:24.297 --> 40:26.459
Yeah. Me, neither.

That's from an impotent
proctologist, by the way.

40:37.018 --> 40:37.974
Enjoy.

40:40.021 --> 40:42.809
Taking that bullet should do
wonders for Baracus' poll numbers.

40:43.816 --> 40:45.148
And a zombie mayor?

40:46.235 --> 40:47.817
That'll help me as well.

around to experience this.

How long are you
gonna be in Seattle?

Just long enough to get my
money and settle some old debts.
