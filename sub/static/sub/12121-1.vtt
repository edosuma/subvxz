00:23.460 --> 00:26.980
Honey, I need more.

00:33.780 --> 00:35.140
This is gonna
take all night.

00:35.140 --> 00:36.020
Want a sandwich?

00:36.020 --> 00:37.780
Maybe later.

00:37.780 --> 00:39.140
Okay.

00:47.660 --> 00:48.700
Hey.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.580
Baby, where are
the road snacks?

00:53.580 --> 00:55.060
We gotta go.
Have you seen my guitar?

01:10.580 --> 01:11.420
Mom?

01:13.140 --> 01:14.860
You're having
a bad dream, baby.

01:14.860 --> 01:16.660
No shit.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.060
We're gonna have to have a
conversation about your language.

01:20.060 --> 01:22.780
Yeah. That's clearly the biggest
problem we're having tonight.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.100
Go back to bed.

01:24.100 --> 01:25.900
Mom!
Now!

01:43.420 --> 01:45.700
Whew.

02:02.820 --> 02:04.300
Okay.

02:04.300 --> 02:06.980
Quiet.
Quiet, Rufus.

02:12.940 --> 02:15.140
Guess what I got for you!
Yummy, yummy! Shh!

02:15.140 --> 02:15.900
Ooh! Look what I got ya!

02:18.820 --> 02:19.780
Cat.

02:21.460 --> 02:23.660
Oh! Good!

02:25.060 --> 02:26.700
There we go.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.940
Nice Rufus.
Good dog.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.340
See ya later.

02:30.340 --> 02:31.660
<i>Attention all units.</i>

02:31.660 --> 02:33.820
<i>Arrest authorized.
Move in now.</i>

02:33.820 --> 02:35.620
You set?
- I'm good.

02:48.940 --> 02:50.540
<i>I have this theory.</i>

02:50.540 --> 02:53.780
Crime is contagious.

02:53.780 --> 02:56.300
It's like it can just
kinda get in the air,

02:56.300 --> 03:01.140
and it-- People can
catch it from each other.

03:01.140 --> 03:04.060
And when they catch it,
they change.

03:04.060 --> 03:07.300
And then they change...
other people.

03:09.740 --> 03:12.660
The truth is we're all
capable of anything.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.380
We don't want to
believe it's true,

03:15.380 --> 03:18.100
but it is.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.180
<i>I realized it
for the first time</i>

03:20.180 --> 03:22.900
<i>at Mindy and Bryce Arbogast's
Fourth of July party.</i>

03:22.900 --> 03:25.020
There you are!

03:25.020 --> 03:27.300
Hi.
I knew you'd come!

03:27.300 --> 03:28.660
Sorry I'm late.

03:28.660 --> 03:29.580
Oh, my God.

03:29.580 --> 03:31.740
I want you to now
I forgive you.

03:31.740 --> 03:34.260
What for?
- Don's okay?

03:34.260 --> 03:38.220
He's--he's great.
We're fine. We're fine.

03:38.220 --> 03:39.740
Hey, listen, I know
you quit the club,

03:39.740 --> 03:42.100
but if Don wants to play,
have him call me.

03:42.100 --> 03:44.500
Oh, I--I'm sure he will,
but, you know,

03:44.500 --> 03:46.460
he's got a whole bunch of big
interviews kind of lined up, and--

03:46.460 --> 03:47.740
Yeah.
- Does he?

03:47.740 --> 03:48.940
Uh-huh.

03:48.940 --> 03:50.980
Oh, it's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

03:50.980 --> 03:51.740
You're gonna be great!

03:51.740 --> 03:52.660
Now--
- Yeah.

03:52.660 --> 03:53.900
About the realtor.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.940
I am okay about
Coldwell.

03:55.940 --> 03:57.980
They're big,
it makes sense.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.620
But I would've
cut my commission.

03:59.620 --> 04:01.980
Mindy--
So just tell--What?

04:03.420 --> 04:07.180
Oh, my God.
Bridget, I am so sorry.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.740
It's not even
listed yet.

04:08.740 --> 04:10.620
I'm sure Don was
gonna tell you.

04:10.620 --> 04:13.620
To tell you the truth,
I don't really blame her.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.220
I got downsized.

04:19.620 --> 04:21.220
You're selling our house?

04:21.220 --> 04:22.820
I'm no longer
the breadwinner.

04:22.820 --> 04:24.780
I don't bring home
the bacon.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.900
I produce no green.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.500
You just-- You wanna
talk about this, sweetie?

04:29.500 --> 04:31.660
Why on earth would I
wanna talk about it?

04:31.660 --> 04:32.940
It's over.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.340
What is over?
- Everything.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.820
No.
- Our lives!

04:35.820 --> 04:37.020
Don, for God sakes!

04:37.020 --> 04:38.900
You are going
to find that job.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.620
It's been over a year.

04:40.620 --> 04:43.180
I have tried everything
I know how to try,

04:43.180 --> 04:44.580
and I have failed,
all right?

04:44.580 --> 04:47.020
No, no, no, no!
No, you did not fail, Don.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.620
No! I refuse
to believe that!

04:48.620 --> 04:51.500
Those stupid multinational
corporations merged you out of a job!

04:51.500 --> 04:53.900
So, sweetie,
you got failed on!

04:53.900 --> 04:58.260
Really? You know, I am so
far past statistical comfort.

04:58.260 --> 04:59.860
Look at this!

04:59.860 --> 05:05.380
We are $286,000
in debt.

05:05.380 --> 05:07.180
What?
- I wasn't kidding.

05:07.180 --> 05:09.180
It's over.

05:09.180 --> 05:11.500
Honey, why didn't you tell me?
We could have stopped.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.260
What? Eating, driving,
living our lives?

05:14.260 --> 05:16.540
We could live on less.
Lots of people live on less.

05:16.540 --> 05:19.220
Absolutely. And soon,
we'll be living with them.

05:19.220 --> 05:21.020
You know, hearing their
voices in the hallways,

05:21.020 --> 05:22.740
smelling
their cooking.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.740
But, hey, at least
we got our health.

05:24.740 --> 05:26.380
Of course, we don't
have health insurance,

05:26.380 --> 05:29.380
so if you need an X-ray,
I sell a kidney.

05:29.380 --> 05:31.660
We'll do something.
We'll think outside the box.

05:31.660 --> 05:34.060
Well, that's good, because
we're selling the box

05:34.060 --> 05:35.860
and we're moving into
a smaller box,

05:35.900 --> 05:37.460
and soon that box
will be so small,

05:37.500 --> 05:39.540
it's the one they put us
in the ground with.

05:39.580 --> 05:42.340
We'll get jobs,
any jobs, both of us,

05:42.340 --> 05:45.020
and we're gonna make our payments
until this economy gets better, Don.

05:45.020 --> 05:47.180
Yeah, well, good luck,
Bridget.

05:50.780 --> 05:52.380
You've been out of
the workforce for some time.

05:52.380 --> 05:54.900
Well, I've raised
two children

05:54.900 --> 05:56.180
and made a home.

05:56.180 --> 05:58.340
My daughter is
a clinical researcher

05:58.340 --> 05:59.820
and my son is
a systems analyst,

05:59.820 --> 06:03.140
and my husband is,
uh, well...

06:03.140 --> 06:05.580
on the sofa right now.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.980
Your degree is in
comparative literature.

06:07.980 --> 06:09.460
Yes.

06:09.460 --> 06:13.220
Sort of a slow sector
of the economy right now.

06:13.220 --> 06:15.900
And your typing
is sub-standard.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.220
Are you proficient on
any kind of software?

06:18.220 --> 06:20.140
I'm good at Google.

06:22.740 --> 06:25.500
Look, the truth is people
your age in the workforce

06:25.500 --> 06:28.380
are generally considered...
real pains in the ass.

06:28.380 --> 06:32.220
Are you aware that statement
is discriminatory and illegal?

06:32.220 --> 06:34.180
See?

06:34.180 --> 06:36.380
And you don't even
work for me.

06:36.380 --> 06:38.980
A drug test?

06:38.980 --> 06:40.860
What kind of drugs
would I have to take?

06:40.860 --> 06:41.940
Hello?

06:43.980 --> 06:47.180
How old am I?

06:47.180 --> 06:48.900
No, I haven't worked
in a hotel.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.660
I've enjoyed some wonderful
times at hotels.

06:51.660 --> 06:52.740
Not yours.

06:52.740 --> 06:56.340
As a waitress,
would--would I get benefits?

06:57.700 --> 06:58.460
I don't think
that's funny.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.540
Of course I understand
about outsourcing.

07:02.540 --> 07:04.460
Yes.

07:04.460 --> 07:07.140
Suppose I was willing
to move to India.

07:10.420 --> 07:11.540
Selina. Hi.

07:11.540 --> 07:14.260
What are you doing here?
- Your check bounced.

07:14.260 --> 07:15.580
That's the third one.

07:15.580 --> 07:17.420
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

07:17.420 --> 07:18.740
I've cleaned your house.
You owe me the money.

07:18.740 --> 07:20.540
Of course.

07:20.540 --> 07:24.140
Honestly, Selina, I don't really
have the money right now,

07:24.140 --> 07:25.980
but as soon as we do--
and in the meantime,

07:25.980 --> 07:27.660
if you need any kind
of references--

07:27.660 --> 07:28.700
I want cash.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.300
I want cash, too.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.820
Obviously, I don't
really have any cash.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.380
I did the work.
You owe me the money.

07:35.380 --> 07:38.500
How about I come clean your house
for three weeks and we call it even?

07:38.500 --> 07:41.780
My house
is already clean.

07:41.780 --> 07:43.060
Ah!

07:44.540 --> 07:45.620
That's yours.

07:45.620 --> 07:47.140
Enjoy.

07:47.140 --> 07:48.380
Okay?

07:50.740 --> 07:51.940
Oh, God.

07:51.940 --> 07:55.420
Don't you know how
to do anything?

07:55.420 --> 07:57.100
We need benefits.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.500
I know some place.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.220
It's work like mine,
but they have benefits.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.340
Why don't you do it?

08:04.340 --> 08:07.140
They won't hire people
with a criminal record.

08:07.140 --> 08:08.700
You have a criminal record?

08:08.700 --> 08:10.580
Arson.

08:10.580 --> 08:12.900
Long story.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.540
Tell me about the job.

08:14.540 --> 08:17.820
I didn't even know what the
Federal Reserve Bank does

08:17.820 --> 08:19.220
before I came
to work here.

08:19.220 --> 08:20.620
Well, they set
interest rates

08:20.620 --> 08:25.340
and they hold extra cash from all
the other banks for safekeeping.

08:25.340 --> 08:28.740
Yeah--No, I--I asked
my husband.

08:28.740 --> 08:31.860
Now that could be your
savings account right there.

08:31.860 --> 08:33.340
I don't think so.
It has money in it.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.220
Oh, we're running
a little bit behind today.

08:37.220 --> 08:39.419
And don't think
they won't notice.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.380
Oh, they tell you
it's for security,

08:41.380 --> 08:43.620
but meanwhile,
the guys in the ties

08:43.659 --> 08:46.820
are keeping track of how many
times a day we need a goddamn pee.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.180
Ha! This place is like
a Las Vegas casino.

08:50.180 --> 08:51.980
No windows,
no privacy,

08:51.980 --> 08:54.060
and a shitload of money
all around here.

08:54.060 --> 08:57.540
The only difference is
nobody here ever has any fun.

08:57.540 --> 08:59.620
<i>Okay, 12.</i>

08:59.620 --> 09:00.900
<i>I'm shifting
to the east vault.</i>

09:04.860 --> 09:06.700
Now, keep your head
down in here.

09:06.700 --> 09:07.620
You know what I mean?

09:11.860 --> 09:14.580
And don't spray directly
on the monitors.

09:34.580 --> 09:36.340
The secret here:

09:36.340 --> 09:39.580
Don't want
anything.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.980
Don't even think
about wanting it.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.460
What you can
think about,

09:43.460 --> 09:45.660
what you can want...

09:45.660 --> 09:48.780
is your job.

09:48.780 --> 09:51.380
I do, yes.
Yes, sir, I do.

09:51.380 --> 09:54.300
I--I am thinking
about wanting...the job!

09:54.300 --> 09:55.820
That's what I'm thinking
about wanting, sir.

09:55.820 --> 09:57.980
Thank you so much
for helping me.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.180
Whoo!
Check this out!

10:13.180 --> 10:14.620
How you doing, Nina?

10:14.620 --> 10:16.060
Not bad.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.500
New girl.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.620
Hey.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.340
Hard to watch, huh?

10:25.580 --> 10:27.380
Worn out.

10:29.980 --> 10:31.940
We get the new bills
from the mint.

10:31.940 --> 10:34.260
There goes your
car payment.

10:34.260 --> 10:35.820
Oops! That's
a new sofa.

10:37.740 --> 10:39.220
Get the one
by the desk there.

10:45.780 --> 10:47.820
In.

10:47.820 --> 10:48.820
Whoa.

10:50.260 --> 10:51.460
Let's go!

10:57.420 --> 10:59.820
It may not seem
like much,

10:59.820 --> 11:03.460
but I do feel like,
in our own way,

11:03.460 --> 11:07.340
we do something kinda
important here.

11:07.340 --> 11:08.500
Oh.

11:11.660 --> 11:14.100
Oh! Oh, God, no!

11:17.340 --> 11:18.500
How's it going?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.260
God.

11:26.580 --> 11:27.580
Hello?

11:27.580 --> 11:28.540
<i>Bridget!
- Mindy.</i>

11:28.540 --> 11:30.140
<i>Hi!
- There you are.</i>

11:30.140 --> 11:33.380
I was just thinking
about you actually.

11:33.380 --> 11:34.460
<i>We've got to talk.</i>

11:34.460 --> 11:35.540
Mindy, you know what?

11:35.540 --> 11:36.980
I'm out to dinner
right now

11:36.980 --> 11:38.700
<i>Oh, sorry, I didn't
mean to interrupt.</i>

11:38.700 --> 11:40.980
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

11:40.980 --> 11:42.220
I would love
to do lunch.

11:42.220 --> 11:43.420
<i>Lunch? Great.
Tomorrow?</i>

11:43.420 --> 11:44.940
Well, not tomorrow.

11:44.940 --> 11:48.220
But how about, um...
this weekend maybe?

11:48.260 --> 11:50.300
That would
be wonderful.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.620
Anyway...bye.

11:52.620 --> 11:53.660
<i>Bye.
- Bye.</i>

12:00.180 --> 12:02.100
Hey.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.900
How'd it go?

12:03.940 --> 12:05.780
Oh.

12:05.780 --> 12:07.460
Honey.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.900
You wanna
talk about it?

12:08.900 --> 12:10.500
<i>You remember that
Frontline we saw</i>

12:10.500 --> 12:12.740
on Third World
slave labor?

12:12.740 --> 12:14.500
Yeah.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.940
Then I don't have to
talk about it.

12:29.220 --> 12:30.460
Oh!

12:32.300 --> 12:34.420
Don!

12:34.420 --> 12:36.500
Don! Don!

12:36.500 --> 12:39.340
You wanna know
what she told me?

12:39.340 --> 12:41.300
How the whole thing
got started?

12:41.300 --> 12:42.300
Oh.

12:43.900 --> 12:46.580
Looks like we're gonna
need a new one of these.

12:46.580 --> 12:51.420
Let me show ya. You see?
You broke it right there.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.540
She went shopping.

12:59.620 --> 13:03.260
There's
something about stuff...

13:03.260 --> 13:05.140
that's on display.

13:05.140 --> 13:08.580
See, even if you've
got the same stuff,

13:08.580 --> 13:11.100
they way they lay it out

13:11.100 --> 13:13.100
makes you want.

13:19.380 --> 13:23.460
Wanting is the root
of all...

13:23.460 --> 13:25.180
needing stuff.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.060
I'll tell you what.

13:32.060 --> 13:33.500
They say money can't
buy happiness,

13:33.500 --> 13:37.340
but it sure as hell
buys everything else.

13:45.980 --> 13:47.460
That's what she said

13:47.460 --> 13:49.180
she was doing when
she got the whole idea.

13:49.180 --> 13:51.180
Just shopping.

13:51.180 --> 13:52.860
Being a good American.

13:56.100 --> 13:59.100
<i>Do you ever
really think about money?</i>

13:59.100 --> 14:02.340
<i>People think that they think
about money all the time.</i>

14:02.340 --> 14:08.220
<i>But how often do we really look
at the actual physical cash?</i>

14:08.220 --> 14:11.100
<i>Once you start to really
think about money,</i>

14:11.100 --> 14:15.500
<i>you realize this stuff
gets touched a lot.</i>

14:15.500 --> 14:16.660
<i>Who had it before you?</i>

14:16.660 --> 14:19.260
<i>And what did they
do with it?</i>

14:19.260 --> 14:22.500
<i>It gets put in places you
may not wanna know about.</i>

14:22.500 --> 14:24.620
<i>When you really stop
and think about it--</i>

14:24.980 --> 14:26.460
<i>money is actually
pretty disgusting.</i>

14:26.460 --> 14:30.380
Well, I mean, we're a consumer
society, aren't we?

14:32.580 --> 14:34.540
She got consumed.

14:36.420 --> 14:42.540
We receive currency from over a
thousand banks in the Tenth District,

14:42.540 --> 14:48.820
which arrives here and enters
a totally secure environment.

14:48.820 --> 14:52.060
Utility rooms,
work rooms,

14:52.060 --> 14:53.460
lunchroom,

14:53.460 --> 14:57.260
lockers, stairs,
elevators.

14:57.260 --> 15:00.900
Everyone, everywhere,
every minute.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.020
Cash sorted.

15:03.060 --> 15:06.300
We find one of only three
keys in the entire system

15:06.300 --> 15:08.540
that will open
a cash cart.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.700
The Treasury Department
inspection room,

15:10.740 --> 15:14.700
where the second key
is held by Agent Wayne here,

15:14.700 --> 15:17.140
decorated 30-year veteran
of the Secret Service--

15:17.140 --> 15:19.900
Lost a tooth taking down
Squeaky Fromme.

15:21.740 --> 15:25.580
Nighttime. The key is locked
up in my security office.

15:25.580 --> 15:28.260
The final step
of the process,

15:28.260 --> 15:30.340
the shredding room.

15:30.340 --> 15:35.100
And here's the third key
wired to the system.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.860
And that's all she wrote.

15:36.860 --> 15:40.180
After this, there's
nothing left to steal.

15:54.940 --> 15:56.420
Oh, this is good.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.740
Okey-dokey. Here we go.

16:00.540 --> 16:02.660
Okay.
Good enough.

16:02.660 --> 16:05.020
Thank you
so much, Don.

16:05.020 --> 16:06.980
I'm gonna take
care of you.

16:06.980 --> 16:08.660
It'll be gone
in no time.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.940
My best to Bridget.

17:09.940 --> 17:11.339
Oh, I'm sorry,
excuse me,

17:11.339 --> 17:13.780
but it looks like you might
have dropped some money.

17:13.780 --> 17:14.900
No, that's not mine.

17:14.900 --> 17:15.900
Really?

17:15.900 --> 17:17.500
Money?

17:20.900 --> 17:22.940
I guess I ought to turn it
into the office, though, huh?

17:22.940 --> 17:24.700
Oh.

17:24.700 --> 17:27.180
Right.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.940
He's a big fat no.

17:45.300 --> 17:48.180
Oh, she's so
in love with me.

17:48.180 --> 17:49.660
I got this.
- Okay.

17:49.660 --> 17:50.580
Oh, I got it.

17:54.020 --> 17:57.020
Hey, beautiful.

17:57.020 --> 18:01.660
You know, you got me so
cuckoo for your... cocoa puffs.

18:01.660 --> 18:02.660
You hear me, baby?

18:06.780 --> 18:08.900
You know what I think of
when somebody calls me "baby?"

18:08.900 --> 18:11.380
Okay, tell me
in my good ear.

18:11.380 --> 18:14.460
I think of years of
sleep deprivation.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.820
Oh. Mmm.

18:16.820 --> 18:19.540
Spit-up on the shoulder
of my last clean shirt.

18:19.540 --> 18:22.340
Diarrhea in a diaper,
the green kind.

18:22.340 --> 18:24.180
See, now that's the image
you just left in my mind.

18:24.180 --> 18:25.460
Now what do you want?

18:25.460 --> 18:28.060
Nothing, Nina. You have
a good evening.

18:28.060 --> 18:29.340
Fool.

18:29.340 --> 18:30.580
Hey, call me.

18:30.580 --> 18:32.900
What?

18:32.900 --> 18:35.020
You got to howl
at the bitches, dawg.

18:35.020 --> 18:36.300
The woman's a working
mother, Shaun.

18:36.300 --> 18:37.380
So?

18:37.380 --> 18:39.500
I'm not your dawg.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.140
More for me.

18:42.540 --> 18:43.500
Oh, boy.

18:46.260 --> 18:48.100
You wanna carpool
tomorrow?

18:48.100 --> 18:48.700
Huh?

19:00.300 --> 19:02.180
Oh. Uh...

19:02.180 --> 19:03.620
can I ask you
something?

19:03.620 --> 19:05.140
Excuse me?

19:06.900 --> 19:08.780
Are you ever tempted?

19:08.780 --> 19:10.460
What, him?

19:10.460 --> 19:11.700
You find that
appealing?

19:11.700 --> 19:13.060
Ecch.
- No, no.

19:13.060 --> 19:15.180
You think what I want
after along day on my feet

19:15.180 --> 19:17.180
is to lie down under
some skinny kid

19:17.180 --> 19:18.540
for three minutes
of push-ups?

19:18.540 --> 19:19.900
No, that's not what
I'm talking about.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.420
I got around plenty in my party
girl days, but I got kids now.

19:22.420 --> 19:24.820
No, no, I meant...

19:24.820 --> 19:26.340
Don't you ever get
tempted to just slip

19:26.340 --> 19:28.420
a couple hundreds
into your pocket?

19:28.420 --> 19:31.300
Okay, I knew you didn't
look like a janitor.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.500
Huh?
What do you mean?

19:32.500 --> 19:34.220
Boy, they are good.

19:34.220 --> 19:36.500
Those guys are sneaky,
I'll give 'em that.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.300
What? You think
I'm a weasel?

19:39.300 --> 19:40.780
Or like a mole thing?

19:40.780 --> 19:43.500
No. I'm serious.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.940
I'm asking.
Just once?

19:44.940 --> 19:46.580
Ever?

19:46.580 --> 19:49.100
Is that what you being
here is all about?

19:49.100 --> 19:51.540
Look, nobody, not once,

19:51.540 --> 19:53.780
has ever beaten the system
in, like, a hundred years.

19:53.820 --> 19:56.500
So what are you, some kinda
like super genius or something?

19:56.540 --> 19:58.380
No. That's what's so funny.
It's just staring you in the face.

19:58.380 --> 20:00.300
You only have to see it.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.140
And you don't think
they've seen it?

20:01.180 --> 20:02.580
No.
- Why?

20:02.580 --> 20:05.020
Because they don't
empty the trash.

20:09.260 --> 20:10.620
What?
- No.

20:10.620 --> 20:12.660
Uh-uh.
Leave me alone.

20:19.420 --> 20:21.180
Here, Mom. You need
to sign this for school.

20:21.180 --> 20:22.620
What is it?

20:22.620 --> 20:24.100
It's a list of weapons
we're not allowed to bring.

20:25.900 --> 20:28.060
Like there's some weapons
you are allowed to bring?

20:28.060 --> 20:29.340
You just have to sign
that you understand.

20:29.340 --> 20:31.700
Oh, I understand.
I just don't understand.

20:33.780 --> 20:34.940
Hello?

20:34.940 --> 20:35.700
You don't want
the money?

20:37.380 --> 20:38.660
I don't wanna go crazy,

20:38.660 --> 20:40.060
and that's what makes
everybody crazy.

20:40.060 --> 20:42.420
Everybody always
wants everything.

20:42.420 --> 20:43.940
I don't want things
I can't have.

20:43.940 --> 20:45.900
Do you live in America?

21:01.220 --> 21:03.780
Hey, Mom, we got
a white woman outside.

21:03.780 --> 21:05.700
What's she doing?

21:05.700 --> 21:07.420
Just standing there.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.380
She's our new
lawn ornament.

21:11.380 --> 21:14.100
Well, she's coming.

21:18.140 --> 21:20.180
Find someone else.
- I can't.

21:20.180 --> 21:22.380
It only works with you in the
shredding room and someone from carts.

21:22.380 --> 21:24.340
It might not even
work then.

21:24.340 --> 21:26.740
Maybe I'm crazy.
You tell me.

21:32.820 --> 21:34.180
Okay.
All right.

21:34.180 --> 21:36.180
Did you do something
wrong at school today?

21:36.180 --> 21:38.380
No. You?
- Not with a lock.

21:38.420 --> 21:39.420
How did you get this?

21:39.420 --> 21:41.180
The same as
the Fed does.

21:41.180 --> 21:44.020
Master Lock Company,
mail order.

21:44.020 --> 21:45.860
Completely legal.

21:45.860 --> 21:47.860
The key won't fit.
No, it won't.

21:47.860 --> 21:49.300
The Fed resets
the cylinders

21:49.300 --> 21:52.220
and makes their
own keys.

21:52.220 --> 21:53.300
Just think about it.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.820
I'm not gonna
think about it.

21:54.820 --> 21:56.540
Oh, okay. That's a good idea.
Don't think about it.

21:56.540 --> 21:57.700
I won't.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.580
Great. Great.
Whatever you do

21:59.580 --> 22:00.380
don't think about it.

22:00.380 --> 22:01.980
Give it up, Miss Daisy!

23:19.780 --> 23:21.020
I have kids!

23:21.020 --> 23:22.540
Yeah, well, so do I!

23:22.540 --> 23:25.380
My husband and I after all these
years are still paying off--

23:25.380 --> 23:28.300
I'm not talking about your
upper middle-class problems.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.300
I'm a single mom.

23:30.300 --> 23:33.580
If this thing goes bad,
I lose my children.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.060
Oh.
- Uh-huh.

23:36.060 --> 23:39.700
Now if that happens,

23:39.700 --> 23:41.220
I will kill you.

23:42.740 --> 23:44.660
You scared of me?

23:44.660 --> 23:46.580
Yeah.

23:46.580 --> 23:48.540
Good.

23:48.540 --> 23:51.220
Now, who do we get
from carts?

24:00.420 --> 24:03.300
Somebody is definitely
peeing in her cup.

24:07.740 --> 24:08.900
Um...

24:08.900 --> 24:10.940
Here, let me
get that for you.

24:10.940 --> 24:12.620
Here you go.

24:12.620 --> 24:13.980
What on earth?

24:15.700 --> 24:17.460
Here.
- Thanks.

24:19.660 --> 24:20.780
There you go.

24:22.180 --> 24:24.260
Okay, then.

24:35.020 --> 24:37.380
Well, we're not looking
for a Girl Scout.

24:37.380 --> 24:40.020
Well, we didn't
find one.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.500
When I was 9 years old,

24:41.500 --> 24:43.580
I found out that every day
for the rest of my life,

24:43.580 --> 24:46.940
I would be sticking
myself with a needle.

24:46.940 --> 24:48.660
Early onset diabetes.

24:56.020 --> 24:58.300
Okay.

24:58.300 --> 24:59.860
I'm in.
- You're in.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.140
Let's do it.

25:01.140 --> 25:03.700
What?
That's it?

25:03.700 --> 25:05.700
You don't want
to think about it?

25:05.700 --> 25:07.020
What's there
to think about?

25:07.020 --> 25:10.060
The...consequences.

25:10.060 --> 25:11.940
Nope.

25:11.940 --> 25:13.620
I'm down.

25:13.620 --> 25:15.780
When do we go?

25:15.780 --> 25:16.780
Well, I don't know.
I mean, obviously,

25:16.780 --> 25:18.500
we have to review
the plan.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.980
Well, I got the plan.
Do you got the plan?

25:19.980 --> 25:21.100
Do you have the lock?

25:21.100 --> 25:22.740
She has it.

25:22.740 --> 25:24.260
So why not?

25:26.060 --> 25:28.540
"Why not" seems like a really
bad reason to do something,

25:28.540 --> 25:29.460
don't you think?

25:29.460 --> 25:30.740
Why?

25:32.900 --> 25:33.540
Okay.

25:35.340 --> 25:36.500
Why not?

25:36.500 --> 25:38.500
All right.

25:38.500 --> 25:39.900
We need a "go" code.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.980
Okay, I'm sorry,
but a "go" code?

25:41.980 --> 25:43.740
I don't think we want
to be walking around the Fed

25:43.740 --> 25:46.420
saying "Let's rob the Fed
today at work," right?

25:46.420 --> 25:50.180
No, you probably don't
want to be saying that.

25:50.180 --> 25:51.900
There you go.
- Oops.

25:51.900 --> 25:53.340
Thanks.

25:56.660 --> 25:57.820
Okay.

25:57.820 --> 25:59.580
We need a code word
like, um--

25:59.580 --> 26:01.060
Um, like...
- Liftoff.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.700
Yeah. Liftoff.

26:03.700 --> 26:06.180
That comes up really
easy in conversation.

26:06.180 --> 26:06.620
Right.

26:06.620 --> 26:09.020
'Cause you don't want it to be
something you could say accidentally.

26:09.020 --> 26:11.740
You know, like, if our
"go" code was "hot",

26:11.740 --> 26:15.700
and I saw you and I said, "Hey,
Nina, you look really hot today,"

26:15.700 --> 26:17.300
and then you go and you
start stealing money,

26:17.300 --> 26:18.900
that could be
a problem.

26:18.900 --> 26:20.180
The last time somebody
told me I looked hot

26:20.180 --> 26:22.980
was about seven years
nine months ago.

26:23.020 --> 26:24.420
And I don't want
to hear it again.

26:24.420 --> 26:26.180
It's been seven years

26:26.180 --> 26:27.420
since you had sex?

26:27.420 --> 26:29.940
All right. Can we just
please focus for a minute?

26:29.940 --> 26:32.380
I think that the signal
should be...

26:32.380 --> 26:34.700
a gesture, basically.

26:36.860 --> 26:38.860
How about something
that doesn't get us

26:38.860 --> 26:40.460
into some sort of
an incident?

26:40.460 --> 26:42.380
How about something
more like...

26:42.380 --> 26:44.740
um, I don't know,
like this?

26:47.460 --> 26:48.540
See?

26:48.540 --> 26:50.340
Right.

26:52.620 --> 26:53.820
Works for me.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.620
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

26:55.620 --> 26:57.580
So...that's it, then.

26:57.580 --> 26:58.940
We're good to go.

27:04.540 --> 27:05.540
I know.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.060
Um...

27:07.060 --> 27:08.340
Jackie?

27:08.340 --> 27:10.140
We need to talk to you
about the drugs.

27:10.140 --> 27:12.020
Okay.

27:12.020 --> 27:13.100
It's none of our
business--

27:13.100 --> 27:14.820
It is our business.

27:14.820 --> 27:16.740
We could go to jail.

27:16.740 --> 27:19.220
Plus it's stupid.

27:19.220 --> 27:20.980
If we see any signs
that the drugs

27:20.980 --> 27:23.820
are affecting your
abilities in any way--

27:23.820 --> 27:25.140
In any way--

27:25.140 --> 27:26.220
We're gonna pull
the plug.

27:26.220 --> 27:28.180
Do you
understand that?

27:28.180 --> 27:31.540
Yeah. No warnings,
no excuses, no apologies.

27:31.540 --> 27:33.420
You mess up, it's over.

27:34.900 --> 27:36.140
Is this like an
intervention?

27:37.940 --> 27:39.500
You damn right.

27:41.540 --> 27:43.540
Wow.

27:43.540 --> 27:44.940
I guess I
could have told them,

27:44.940 --> 27:47.580
but I was just really...

27:47.580 --> 27:49.940
touched.

27:49.940 --> 27:52.540
That they would take the trouble
and everything, you know?

27:54.860 --> 27:57.100
<i>This takeover bid
is irresponsible!</i>

27:57.100 --> 28:00.180
<i>I think the CEO has
lost his mind.</i>

28:00.180 --> 28:01.540
<i>And honestly,</i>

28:01.540 --> 28:03.740
<i>the whole board ought
to get 20 years--</i>

28:03.780 --> 28:05.900
Yeah, right.

28:05.900 --> 28:07.420
Like white guys are
gonna do time.

28:07.420 --> 28:09.500
20 years?
Man, we'd get that

28:09.500 --> 28:11.900
if we stole a candy bar
from a convenience store.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.980
Hey! You listen to me!

28:13.980 --> 28:15.980
You ain't no man
making jokes about crime.

28:15.980 --> 28:17.220
Ain't no men in prison.

28:17.220 --> 28:19.260
Just corpses don't know
enough to lie down.

28:19.260 --> 28:21.340
Now that is not who
you're gonna be.

28:21.340 --> 28:23.540
I don't care what I gotta do,
you're not going that way.

28:23.540 --> 28:25.180
Do you hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.

28:27.980 --> 28:29.340
I was gonna go steal
candy bars,

28:29.340 --> 28:31.340
but now I won't.

28:36.980 --> 28:38.940
Come here.
Give me some love.

28:56.020 --> 28:58.260
Okay.

28:58.260 --> 28:59.700
That's good.

29:17.260 --> 29:18.260
What?

29:20.780 --> 29:22.100
You got a boyfriend?

30:06.100 --> 30:07.300
What happened?

30:07.300 --> 30:08.580
Just quit yelling.

30:08.580 --> 30:10.700
I'm not yelling!
- Yes, you are! That's yelling.

30:10.700 --> 30:12.060
Shh! Quiet.
- Not so loud.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.220
Do you want to tell us
what happened, Jackie?

30:19.020 --> 30:19.700
I had a bad feeling.

30:20.940 --> 30:23.460
You had a...bad feeling.

30:23.460 --> 30:25.580
I take my feelings
seriously.

30:25.580 --> 30:28.980
So nobody...said
anything or did anything?

30:28.980 --> 30:29.300
No.

30:29.300 --> 30:31.860
I had a bad feeling.

30:33.940 --> 30:35.300
Okay, I'm sorry.

30:35.300 --> 30:36.540
That's it.
I'm outta here.

30:36.540 --> 30:37.820
No, no, wait!
- Wait? Wait for what?

30:37.820 --> 30:40.100
Huh? The alarms?
They're going off!

30:40.100 --> 30:43.140
Dimwit junkie alert!
Whacked out Martha Stewart wannabe.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.860
What the hell
was I thinking?

30:48.100 --> 30:49.780
Seriously, it was
real bad!

30:55.260 --> 30:57.180
Quit pissing
and moaning, people.

30:57.180 --> 30:59.220
It's in your contract.

30:59.220 --> 31:03.620
Section 41:
"Employees will submit

31:03.620 --> 31:06.780
to full random
security searches."

31:06.780 --> 31:10.260
Everyone, everywhere,
every minute.

31:10.260 --> 31:11.620
Let's go.
Come on.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.220
Ma'am?

31:13.220 --> 31:15.660
Thank you.

31:15.660 --> 31:16.300
Come on, let's go.

32:41.580 --> 32:45.060
<i># I got a woman

33:39.020 --> 33:39.980
Hold on.

33:47.420 --> 33:48.620
Thanks.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.060
It's my job.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.780
Right.
Mine, too.

33:55.220 --> 33:56.180
Back to work, then.

34:00.860 --> 34:04.340

34:27.980 --> 34:29.820
4937.

34:44.420 --> 34:45.540
Tilt down a little.

34:48.260 --> 34:49.659
Down.

34:49.659 --> 34:50.940
Sorry?
- About 9 degrees.

34:53.100 --> 34:54.340
Zoom in.

34:56.580 --> 34:59.660
What we really need
is thermal imaging.

35:03.340 --> 35:04.940
Amateur.

35:06.860 --> 35:10.140
<i># Don't have to worry

36:55.420 --> 36:59.260
Now I've got two reasons
to love control top.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.060
I'm gotta get myself
some boring underpants.

37:01.060 --> 37:02.340
I know.

37:02.340 --> 37:05.020
I bet Victoria never had
this particular secret.

37:06.460 --> 37:07.420
I can't get this in there.

37:07.420 --> 37:09.620
Oh, that hurts.

37:09.620 --> 37:10.660
We've gotta hurry.

37:12.580 --> 37:15.180
Okay, there we go.
Got it?

37:15.180 --> 37:16.940
All right, now everybody
quit smiling. Quit smiling.

37:28.180 --> 37:29.900
Next up?

37:54.980 --> 37:56.140
Ahem.
- Oh.

37:56.140 --> 37:58.220
Okay, thank you.

37:58.220 --> 37:59.700
Thank you.

38:01.660 --> 38:03.100
How you doing today?

38:03.100 --> 38:05.020
I'm good. You?

38:05.020 --> 38:07.100
I'm...

38:11.020 --> 38:12.180
I'm good.

38:12.180 --> 38:15.060
Good.
Um, you know what?

38:15.060 --> 38:17.420
I think you are
always just...

38:17.420 --> 38:18.380
You're so...

38:18.380 --> 38:20.660
polite.

38:20.660 --> 38:22.140
Next!

38:23.740 --> 38:25.820
What goes around
comes around.

38:25.820 --> 38:27.660
Too true.

38:30.300 --> 38:31.940
Spoken like
a real gentleman.

38:31.940 --> 38:34.140
I don't want to be forward and
this is not the best place to talk--

38:34.140 --> 38:36.060
Mrs. Cardigan!

38:50.740 --> 38:52.220
Oh--
- Step back, please.

39:01.260 --> 39:03.900
I think you
dropped this.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.500
Oh.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.060
Thank you, Mr. Glover.

39:07.060 --> 39:10.700
Everyone, everywhere,
every minute.

39:10.700 --> 39:11.980
Carry on.

39:17.540 --> 39:20.180
I was wondering maybe...
do you like jazz?

39:20.180 --> 39:21.980
What?

39:21.980 --> 39:25.660
Oh. Uh...no.
Sorry.

39:28.140 --> 39:29.900
"Do you like jazz?"

39:29.900 --> 39:31.460
Shut up!

39:31.460 --> 39:32.780
Next!

39:38.500 --> 39:40.420
Okay, wait a second.
Oh, 183.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.340
183 equals...

39:44.980 --> 39:46.460
Can everyone count
to themselves, please?

39:46.460 --> 39:49.100
What's up with all
these one-dollar bills?

39:49.100 --> 39:50.300
I was in a hurry.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.060
We're gonna have to get
this bug worked out.

39:52.060 --> 39:54.100
Only large bills.

39:55.660 --> 39:58.460
Okay. I have $32,000.

39:58.460 --> 40:00.900
31.
- 28.

40:03.220 --> 40:04.780
Damn.
- What?

40:04.780 --> 40:05.940
What's the matter?

40:05.940 --> 40:07.900
If we each give her one,
that leaves a thousand,

40:07.900 --> 40:09.860
which is 333 each.

40:09.860 --> 40:12.100
There's gonna be
a dollar left over.

40:12.100 --> 40:14.180
I might have change.

40:14.180 --> 40:15.820
Keep the change.

40:19.980 --> 40:23.140
<i># The best things
in life are free #</i>

40:23.140 --> 40:25.220
<i># But you can give them
to the birds and bees #</i>

40:25.220 --> 40:27.460
Gimme the money, baby!

40:29.620 --> 40:32.780
Let's see mama
making that cash!

40:32.780 --> 40:36.340
<i># That's what I want #</i>

40:37.820 --> 40:38.980
Don.

40:40.660 --> 40:41.740
Hi.

40:43.740 --> 40:45.300
Wanna lap dance?

40:45.300 --> 40:49.020
<i># That's what I want #</i>

40:49.020 --> 40:51.340
<i># That's what I want #</i>

40:51.340 --> 40:52.740
You know something?
I would have thought

40:52.740 --> 40:54.660
you would have been
a whole lot happier.

40:54.660 --> 40:57.140
Oh, forgive me for getting
insufficient kicks

40:57.140 --> 40:59.340
when somebody I'm married to
commits a felony.

40:59.340 --> 41:00.660
Don!

41:00.660 --> 41:02.620
This money doesn't even
officially exist anymore.

41:02.620 --> 41:04.020
That's the beauty
of the whole thing.

41:04.020 --> 41:06.260
Look at it.
It's worn out.

41:06.260 --> 41:07.500
It's gonna be shredded.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.660
So what do we do?
We take some. We spend it.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.860
It goes to another bank.
It's still worn out.

41:11.860 --> 41:13.220
So what do they do?

41:13.220 --> 41:15.300
They pull it
from the system...again!

41:15.300 --> 41:18.540
It's like we're stealing
the same money over and over.

41:18.540 --> 41:20.940
In fact, it's not even
like stealing money at all.

41:20.940 --> 41:22.340
It's more like
recycling.

41:22.340 --> 41:24.140
Oh, recycling!

41:24.140 --> 41:26.140
Yeah, your defense attorney's
gonna love that one, Bridget.

41:26.140 --> 41:27.500
I'm not gonna
get caught.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.620
My God, Don, we're
very careful.

41:29.620 --> 41:30.860
We have signals
and "go" codes.

41:30.860 --> 41:33.260
We have a system here
that works--

41:33.260 --> 41:36.340
Oh, please, God. Tell me you're
not planning on doing this again.

41:36.340 --> 41:38.620
What--what, do you think
I'm stupid?

41:38.620 --> 41:40.340
Of course we're going
to do this again.

41:40.340 --> 41:41.540
At least until we get
out of the hole.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.380
Four or five more times.

41:43.380 --> 41:44.860
Nina gets school paper,

41:44.860 --> 41:46.420
and Jackie, honestly,
I really don't know

41:46.420 --> 41:47.820
what the hell
she is going to do.

41:47.820 --> 41:49.660
You know something?
You've gone insane, Bridget.

41:49.660 --> 41:52.860
Honey, you see
a $20 bill on the sidewalk.

41:52.860 --> 41:54.540
Let me just ask you.
What do you do?

41:54.540 --> 41:56.820
Do you walk away? No.

41:56.820 --> 41:58.540
You know, I guess
it would depend

41:58.540 --> 42:00.420
on whether or not
the sidewalk

42:00.420 --> 42:02.860
were locked inside
a Federal bank!

42:02.860 --> 42:06.220
Honestly! When you have spent
months cleaning their toilets,

42:06.220 --> 42:07.660
the whole
Federal bank thing

42:07.660 --> 42:10.300
doesn't seem like
such a great big deal.

42:10.300 --> 42:12.700
What about the overall
system of monetary flow, hmm?

42:12.700 --> 42:13.940
What?

42:13.940 --> 42:16.140
You know that they print
a certain amount of money

42:16.140 --> 42:18.100
relating to assets in
other parts of the system.

42:18.100 --> 42:20.540
Uh-huh. Where?
I don't know, but--

42:20.540 --> 42:22.020
Yes!
- Seriously, you could be...

42:22.060 --> 42:24.740
you could be throwing off
the entire balance of trade.

42:24.780 --> 42:27.660
You could be endangering the
dollar against the--the yen.

42:27.660 --> 42:30.460
Don, I am gonna keep
doing this.

42:30.460 --> 42:32.500
The yen is just gonna
have to take care of itself.

42:34.220 --> 42:35.860
See, the problem is

42:35.860 --> 42:38.420
we just don't accept
mid-semester transfers

42:38.420 --> 42:40.580
or financial aid
students. We--

42:40.580 --> 42:42.580
I won't be needing
financial aid.

42:42.580 --> 42:44.100
I'm sorry?

42:44.100 --> 42:46.900
I can pay now...
for the full year.

42:46.900 --> 42:48.420
Oh.

42:48.420 --> 42:49.580
I might also be inclined

42:49.580 --> 42:52.220
to make a significant donation
to your new library...

42:52.220 --> 42:54.060
if my sons were using it.

42:55.260 --> 42:57.740
Well, that would...

42:57.740 --> 42:59.100
be a different situation
now, wouldn't it?

42:59.100 --> 43:00.780
Can I pay you in crack?

43:03.700 --> 43:04.900
I'm just kidding with you.

43:04.900 --> 43:06.940
Oh.

43:08.340 --> 43:10.460
It has to be under ten.

43:10.460 --> 43:13.540
Anything over 10,000 is
automatically reported to the IRS.

43:13.540 --> 43:15.580
I know.
You told me.

43:15.580 --> 43:17.620
I'm gonna keep the engine
going while you're in there.

43:17.620 --> 43:19.740
Relax.

43:19.740 --> 43:21.860
We're making a deposit, Don.
We already robbed the bank.

43:21.860 --> 43:23.860
That's not even funny.

43:23.860 --> 43:25.300
Honey, you know what?
You gotta lighten up,

43:25.300 --> 43:26.660
or I'm gonna have to
have you whacked.

43:26.660 --> 43:27.940
When did you even start
talking like that?

43:27.940 --> 43:29.100
I'm kidding you.

43:29.100 --> 43:30.940
But really, sweetie,

43:30.940 --> 43:34.460
I'm the only person in the
whole world who thought this up.

43:34.460 --> 43:35.860
Why can't you
be proud of me?

43:35.860 --> 43:38.380
I have no idea
who you are anymore,

43:38.380 --> 43:40.380
but I'm enormously
proud of you.

43:41.620 --> 43:43.740
Really?
- Yeah!

43:43.740 --> 43:45.420
No, you are amazing.

43:45.420 --> 43:46.700
Really? Are you
proud of me?

43:46.700 --> 43:48.060
Tell me again.
- You are so hot.

43:50.500 --> 43:51.580
Oh, my God.

43:51.580 --> 43:53.860
When was the last time
we did it in a car?

43:53.860 --> 43:54.940
We've never done it
in the car.

43:54.940 --> 43:57.180
It'd be so stupid
to do it in a car...

43:57.220 --> 43:58.900
'cause we have a house.

43:58.900 --> 44:00.220
Oh, God,
yes, we do.

44:00.260 --> 44:01.420
We have a house.

44:01.420 --> 44:03.460
Let's go do it
in our house.

44:03.460 --> 44:04.580
You know what?
- What?

44:04.580 --> 44:06.500
They got a park
right behind the bank.

44:06.500 --> 44:08.180
Oh, that is such
a good idea! Yes!

44:08.180 --> 44:10.980
Okay, which ones do you want me
to get the cashier's checks for?

44:10.980 --> 44:12.420
Baby, keep that
engine running.

44:15.460 --> 44:16.620
Shh.

44:24.540 --> 44:26.180
<i># Hot change #</i>

44:26.180 --> 44:28.580
<i># Got it right
in the groove #</i>

44:28.580 --> 44:30.700

Thanks.

44:40.660 --> 44:42.980

44:47.020 --> 44:50.220

44:50.220 --> 44:51.580
Next!

44:51.580 --> 44:54.340

<i># It's a racka tacka

45:14.420 --> 45:17.420
Here's to a job
well done.

45:17.420 --> 45:19.380
Unbelievable,
terrifying,

45:19.380 --> 45:21.700
and thankfully
over.

45:27.140 --> 45:28.860
Well, I think we should
keep going.

45:34.460 --> 45:36.180
Oh, no.
Sweetheart, that'd be--

45:36.180 --> 45:38.140
No, that's--that's
a bad idea.

45:38.140 --> 45:40.340
Yeah. He's right.
That wasn't part of the deal.

45:40.380 --> 45:41.460
We were supposed
to just...

45:41.460 --> 45:43.060
you know, get what
we needed and get out.

45:43.060 --> 45:46.940
I think we need more, right?

45:46.940 --> 45:49.980
I could use more.

45:49.980 --> 45:52.700
More wouldn't hurt.

45:52.700 --> 45:54.620
No. See, don't
get greedy.

45:54.620 --> 45:56.220
See, that's how
people get caught.

45:56.220 --> 45:58.980
Exactly. I think we're
asking for trouble.

45:58.980 --> 46:02.220
Don! You've worked your ass
off for 30 years and for what?

46:02.220 --> 46:04.420
So you can see your wife
become a janitor?

46:04.420 --> 46:05.460
And Nina?

46:05.460 --> 46:08.060
You've spent years
standing in one spot

46:08.060 --> 46:09.340
throwing money into
a shredder

46:09.340 --> 46:10.780
so your boys could
have a better life,

46:10.780 --> 46:13.020
and were they one bit
closer to their dream?

46:13.020 --> 46:14.620
Jackie.

46:14.620 --> 46:16.220
There must be something
that you've always

46:16.220 --> 46:17.780
wanted to do
with your life.

46:17.780 --> 46:22.340
Yes. I wanna see Brazil
and Czechoslovakia

46:22.340 --> 46:24.180
and India--

46:24.180 --> 46:26.460
Actually, there is no
Czechoslovakia.

46:26.460 --> 46:29.140
What?

46:29.140 --> 46:31.940
It's--it's either the Czech
Republic now or Slovakia.

46:31.940 --> 46:34.100
Since when?

46:34.100 --> 46:35.900
1992.

46:35.900 --> 46:38.180
India's still there,
right?

46:38.180 --> 46:40.700
Yes. Yes.
Absolutely.

46:40.700 --> 46:42.780
I wanna see those places for myself.
- Yeah.

46:42.780 --> 46:44.900
And I don't care
where we go

46:44.900 --> 46:47.020
just as long as I don't have
to carry any more dead cows.

46:48.700 --> 46:50.100
What's that?

46:50.100 --> 46:52.660
Bob works for Allen
Brothers Meat Packing.

46:52.660 --> 46:55.020
Oh. Oh.
- There you go.

46:55.020 --> 46:56.740
Don.
- What?

46:56.740 --> 47:00.660
Is it wrong? Is it really, really,
really terrible to want security?

47:00.660 --> 47:03.740
Long-term financial
security?

47:03.740 --> 47:06.180
How about long-term
maximum security?

47:06.220 --> 47:07.740
Because that's where we're
headed if we keep doing this.

47:07.740 --> 47:09.380
Never having
to worry again

47:09.420 --> 47:13.060
about sickness, old age, the real
estate market, corporate fallout,

47:13.060 --> 47:14.020
your kids in college,

47:14.060 --> 47:16.460
and a master bath
with a walk-in closet.

47:16.460 --> 47:17.740
What?

47:17.740 --> 47:19.340
You almost sounded rational
there for a minute.

47:19.340 --> 47:20.500
A walk-in closet?

47:20.500 --> 47:23.100
We can't spend that money.

47:23.100 --> 47:24.740
I'm sorry.
What?

47:24.740 --> 47:26.060
You know how people
get busted?

47:26.060 --> 47:28.620
They brag
and they flash.

47:28.620 --> 47:30.860
You don't think it will
draw a little attention?

47:30.860 --> 47:33.300
Three girls from the Fed start
spending money they can't explain?

47:33.300 --> 47:35.060
I mean, if we're
gonna do this,

47:35.060 --> 47:36.740
no big-ticket
purchases,

47:36.740 --> 47:37.860
no lifestyle changes.

47:37.860 --> 47:40.340
We just go slow
and be smart.

47:40.340 --> 47:41.780
Oh, man.

47:41.780 --> 47:43.380
I hate being smart.

47:43.380 --> 47:45.700
When it's enough,

47:45.700 --> 47:47.540
we all move somewhere
where nobody knows

47:47.540 --> 47:49.580
we're not supposed to have
that kind of money.

47:49.580 --> 47:53.980
Look, Nina, I understand that
you don't want to spend the money,

47:53.980 --> 47:55.660
and you don't
really want sex--

47:55.660 --> 47:57.460
Wait a minute!

47:57.460 --> 47:59.060
I want to have sex.
I want to have sex.

47:59.060 --> 48:01.220
Actually, if you can
come back in a minute.

48:01.220 --> 48:02.180
It's been seven years.

48:02.180 --> 48:04.220
I want it all day
and all night.

48:04.220 --> 48:05.740
But while we're living
in the real world,

48:05.740 --> 48:08.500
if we're gonna do this, we're
gonna do it right or not at all.

48:08.500 --> 48:09.620
You don't seem
to understand.

48:09.620 --> 48:12.220
This is my plan.

48:12.220 --> 48:14.900
Okay. So go do your plan!

48:14.900 --> 48:17.620
Oops. You can't, can you?

48:17.620 --> 48:19.380
Not by yourself.
You can't tell me what to do.

48:19.380 --> 48:20.140
Would you stop fighting?

48:20.140 --> 48:23.380
My way or
no way at all.

48:30.620 --> 48:32.380
Okay.

48:32.380 --> 48:34.340
Could I try
this one on?

48:34.340 --> 48:36.820
Of course.

48:36.820 --> 48:38.540
Oh, my God.

48:38.540 --> 48:39.500
How much?

48:39.500 --> 48:41.780
62,000.

48:42.980 --> 48:44.860
That's a lot.
Not Really.

48:44.860 --> 48:46.140
You pay for quality.

48:53.940 --> 48:56.220
What?
- You're spending the money.

48:56.220 --> 48:57.260
What are you
talking about?

48:57.260 --> 48:59.380
Of course I'm not
spending the money.

48:59.380 --> 49:00.740
No?
- No.

49:00.740 --> 49:01.740
What's this?

49:01.740 --> 49:03.180
Uh--

49:03.180 --> 49:05.740
Nina, it's nothing.
That's not even real.

49:05.740 --> 49:07.060
It's not?
- No.

49:07.060 --> 49:08.500
Wow.
- Wait! Hey!

49:08.500 --> 49:09.980
Good!
- No! Wait!

49:09.980 --> 49:11.420
Nina!

49:11.420 --> 49:13.260
That's mine, Nina!

49:14.900 --> 49:16.460
Okay! That was hostile.

49:18.260 --> 49:21.100
Don't spend the money.

49:21.100 --> 49:22.500
Oh!

49:47.820 --> 49:49.260
Sorry I'm late.

49:49.260 --> 49:50.460
Where have you been?

49:50.460 --> 49:51.780
It's 33-40. Here.

49:51.780 --> 49:53.500
No! Don't!

49:53.500 --> 49:55.580
Oh!

49:55.580 --> 49:56.900
Oh, shit!

49:56.900 --> 49:59.420
What?
- The key!

50:01.140 --> 50:02.420
Oh, shit!

50:02.420 --> 50:03.380
Oh! Oh!

50:03.380 --> 50:04.540
Okay, where's the spare?

50:04.540 --> 50:05.780
It's in the drain.

50:05.780 --> 50:06.980
You didn't get
Jackie's key?

50:06.980 --> 50:09.060
I already did the first floor.
I can't go back up.

50:09.060 --> 50:10.820
Do you have Jackie's
cell number?

50:10.820 --> 50:12.580
No, I never put it
in my phone.

50:12.580 --> 50:13.900
I didn't want anything
to tie her to me.

50:13.900 --> 50:15.660
Oh, God!
Come on!

50:15.660 --> 50:17.540
Look, I gotta go.
My break is over.

50:17.540 --> 50:19.580
Okay, go, go, go.
I'll figure something out.

50:27.580 --> 50:30.620
All right, okay.
Just calm down.

50:30.620 --> 50:33.820
Um, I'll think
of something here.

50:33.820 --> 50:35.860
I'll call you
right back.

50:35.860 --> 50:37.180
Okay, bye-bye.
Oh, my God!

50:54.140 --> 50:56.460
Five minutes.
Jesus, God.

51:01.260 --> 51:03.220
Hey! Hey, what the hell
are you doing out here?

51:03.220 --> 51:04.580
You're not on
break time.

51:04.580 --> 51:05.780
He's got an important
call to make.

51:05.780 --> 51:07.980
You work here?
Put the phone away.

51:07.980 --> 51:09.580
Make the call.
Make the call.

51:09.580 --> 51:10.540
You do
and you're fired.

51:10.540 --> 51:11.980
Hey, listen you know
something, fathead?

51:11.980 --> 51:13.900
Why don't you just put
the damn stopwatch down, huh?

51:13.900 --> 51:15.820
This is a family
emergency here.

51:15.820 --> 51:17.740
Look around you!
These are people!

51:17.740 --> 51:19.140
You know, if you
fire this man,

51:19.140 --> 51:21.580
each one of these guys is
gonna walk off this dock.

51:21.580 --> 51:22.900
Right, fellas?

51:22.900 --> 51:24.460
Fellas?

51:24.460 --> 51:26.180
You're on your own, Spartacus.
- Nope.

51:27.380 --> 51:29.100
They cut benefits, man.

51:31.380 --> 51:32.500
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

51:32.500 --> 51:34.420
Hey, doll face.

51:34.420 --> 51:35.660
Prick.

51:58.420 --> 51:59.420
Don. Don. Don.

52:01.980 --> 52:04.820
What in the hell is that
woman doing in there?

52:08.860 --> 52:10.340
Oh, that's not it.

52:10.340 --> 52:11.700
Shit!

52:13.620 --> 52:15.980
No!

52:15.980 --> 52:17.540
Bob, no.

52:17.540 --> 52:19.060
No, I can't go down there.

52:19.060 --> 52:21.140
I can't go down there,
not until sorting finishes.

52:28.500 --> 52:29.140
You all right?

52:29.140 --> 52:31.860
Huh?
- You okay?

52:31.860 --> 52:35.660
Yeah. Just, you know,
carpal tunnel.

52:35.660 --> 52:37.020
Messes with me
sometimes.

52:38.980 --> 52:40.380
Fantastic. Yes.
All right. I love you.

52:45.260 --> 52:47.700
Oh! Oh, my--

52:47.700 --> 52:50.060
Mrs. Cardigan.
- Mr. Glover.

52:50.060 --> 52:54.740
You spend an unusual amount
of time in this bathroom.

52:58.740 --> 53:01.820
Everyone...

53:01.820 --> 53:02.940
everywhere...

53:05.020 --> 53:06.980
...every minute.

53:06.980 --> 53:08.780
Yeah.

53:08.780 --> 53:10.660
Uh...

53:10.660 --> 53:14.420
are you watching when
everybody goes everywhere?

53:14.420 --> 53:17.380
I really
hope so because...

53:17.380 --> 53:18.700
maybe you can tell me

53:18.700 --> 53:20.740
why they can't
use the facility

53:20.740 --> 53:23.980
in such a way as to keep
everything in the facility?

53:23.980 --> 53:26.220
I'm a college-educated
woman,

53:26.220 --> 53:29.180
and I really don't
understand the physics.

53:29.180 --> 53:32.420
Maybe--maybe you can
see how they even manage

53:32.420 --> 53:35.460
to get what they get
where they get it!

53:35.460 --> 53:36.460
You know what
we can do?

53:36.500 --> 53:37.940
You and I could hang out.

53:37.940 --> 53:40.100
You can get on the floor
like I do every day

53:40.100 --> 53:41.300
and make a report!

53:41.300 --> 53:44.420
How about that, Mr. Glover?
Huh? Do you like that idea?

53:44.420 --> 53:46.300
What about that?
- Carry on!

53:46.300 --> 53:47.340
Oh, my God.

53:57.980 --> 53:59.740
Okay.
Let's go.

53:59.740 --> 54:00.700
Think fast.

54:02.140 --> 54:02.900
Hi!

54:03.820 --> 54:04.900
Ooh!
Watch out.

54:17.180 --> 54:18.980
What?

54:18.980 --> 54:20.060
What?

54:20.060 --> 54:21.580
I heard that.

54:21.580 --> 54:22.660
You heard what?

54:22.660 --> 54:26.060
I am married, asshole.

54:27.260 --> 54:29.100
I ought to report you.

54:29.100 --> 54:30.220
What the hell did you
say to her, man?

54:30.220 --> 54:32.100
Nothing.

54:32.100 --> 54:33.620
Maybe she reads minds.

54:49.740 --> 54:51.140
You need a hand with that?

54:51.140 --> 54:53.100
No. No, no, no,
It's just fine.

54:53.100 --> 54:54.700
Sometimes with these new
ones, you gotta wiggle them.

54:54.700 --> 54:56.460
No, no, no.
Let me help you. I got it.

54:56.460 --> 54:57.700
Your carpal tunnel
and everything.

54:57.700 --> 54:58.820
Oh!

55:03.380 --> 55:05.180
Oh!

55:05.180 --> 55:06.820
Hey!

55:06.860 --> 55:09.340
Seriously, guys!
Grow up, okay!

55:09.340 --> 55:10.860
I'm not your personal
maid, all right?

55:12.860 --> 55:14.180
Oh, yes!

55:20.300 --> 55:21.700
Hi.

55:21.700 --> 55:22.740
Slow it down.

55:31.780 --> 55:33.620
Man!

55:33.620 --> 55:35.300
This thing's
really stuck.

55:35.300 --> 55:36.020
Security.

55:37.500 --> 55:39.860
I'll be right back.
One second.

55:47.100 --> 55:50.060
Oh! Whose your pick
for the playoffs?

55:50.060 --> 55:51.700
What playoffs?

55:51.700 --> 55:54.140
Oh!

55:54.140 --> 55:56.860
Oh, my God.
I thought there were playoffs.

55:56.860 --> 55:57.980
Oh, man.

55:57.980 --> 55:59.260
Oh, my God.

56:02.300 --> 56:03.660
Got it.

56:03.660 --> 56:04.740
Great.

56:09.100 --> 56:10.780
Told you.

56:15.380 --> 56:19.420
<i># Ain't nobody #</i>

56:19.420 --> 56:22.220
<i># Can do me like
Jesus can #</i>

56:22.220 --> 56:23.580
<i># Ain't nobody #</i>

56:26.940 --> 56:28.900
Yeah?

56:28.900 --> 56:30.140
Oh, thank God.

56:30.140 --> 56:31.980
They're okay.

56:31.980 --> 56:34.180
Oh, sweetheart.

56:34.180 --> 56:36.740
Oh, yeah!

56:38.380 --> 56:39.900
Oh, God!

56:39.900 --> 56:40.940
Wow.

56:48.860 --> 56:49.940
I'm sorry about your job.

56:52.020 --> 56:53.700
I hated my job.

56:56.100 --> 56:58.340
I used to think
I did, too.

57:03.540 --> 57:05.540
We need to talk.

57:07.460 --> 57:10.620
Look, Barry, I know you're
probably a really nice guy and all,

57:10.620 --> 57:12.340
and I don't want to
make you feel badly,

57:12.340 --> 57:14.740
but I'm really not in a
place in my life right now--

57:16.980 --> 57:20.340
Unless you have half a dozen
very hard, rectangular breasts,

57:20.340 --> 57:22.780
we need to talk.

57:25.300 --> 57:27.780
Are you ought of your mind?

57:27.780 --> 57:28.980
Look, if you're
gonna bust me, bust me.

57:28.980 --> 57:31.220
I don't need a lecture.

57:31.220 --> 57:32.740
Who else is it?

57:32.740 --> 57:34.380
The trash woman.
Who else?

57:34.380 --> 57:36.220
I can't tell you that.

57:36.220 --> 57:38.620
Tell them it's over.

57:43.340 --> 57:44.500
What does he mean it's over?

57:44.500 --> 57:46.540
Does it mean he turns
us in and we go to prison?

57:46.540 --> 57:47.940
It's over, and nobody
says anything?

57:47.940 --> 57:49.180
We walk away it's over?

57:49.180 --> 57:50.860
I don't know. I'm just
telling you what he said.

57:50.860 --> 57:51.940
That's kinda like
a major difference.

57:51.940 --> 57:54.380
Planning my weekend
or planning my bail hearing.

57:54.380 --> 57:57.060
Okay, okay.
Please stop fighting.

57:57.060 --> 57:58.220
Now now, not here.

57:58.220 --> 58:00.500
I think it meant
walk away.

58:00.500 --> 58:01.660
Yeah, because?

58:01.660 --> 58:03.500
Because we're
still here.

58:05.300 --> 58:06.780
Wow.

58:06.780 --> 58:08.700
And he...
he likes me.

58:08.700 --> 58:09.740
Hmm?

58:11.820 --> 58:13.780
He does like you,
doesn't he?

58:14.940 --> 58:16.860
A lot.

58:17.940 --> 58:20.740
Oh, no.
No. Uh-uh!

58:20.780 --> 58:22.540
That would be brilliant, Nina.
- No!

58:22.540 --> 58:24.220
If you guys got
together,

58:24.220 --> 58:26.660
and then he was
on our team, and then...

58:26.660 --> 58:28.100
we would be foolproof.

58:28.140 --> 58:29.420
So what are you saying?

58:29.420 --> 58:31.500
Do you know what it is when
somebody trades sex for money?

58:31.500 --> 58:32.460
Advertising.

58:32.460 --> 58:34.460
Public service?

58:34.460 --> 58:36.580
A good percentage
of marriages.

58:36.580 --> 58:38.660
What is with you people?

58:38.660 --> 58:40.860
Now these are on me.

58:48.620 --> 58:50.540
Look, we got a good thing
going here.

58:50.540 --> 58:52.420
And if getting Barry
on our side

58:52.420 --> 58:54.180
is the only way
we can keep going,

58:54.180 --> 58:55.620
I don't think it's asking too much
for you to take one for the team.

58:55.620 --> 58:57.980
Right.
I mean...

58:57.980 --> 59:00.300
besides, he's
a total babe.

59:00.300 --> 59:01.820
And you know, honey,
we would do this for you.

59:01.820 --> 59:03.060
We would do this for you.
- Right.

59:03.060 --> 59:04.740
Except we happen
to be married.

59:04.740 --> 59:05.820
And of course,
guess what?

59:05.820 --> 59:07.500
P.S., he doesn't
even want us.

59:07.500 --> 59:08.780
He might not even
want me.

59:08.780 --> 59:11.740
Oh, yeah, right.
Okay.

59:11.740 --> 59:13.220
Wake up!

59:13.220 --> 59:15.700
He's, like, all over
you all the time.

59:15.700 --> 59:18.100
Nina,

59:18.100 --> 59:21.260
are you worried because
it's been so long?

59:21.260 --> 59:26.580
No, Nina, it's just like
riding a bicycle...upside down.

59:26.580 --> 59:29.900
Okay, look, I still know
how to do it, okay?

59:29.900 --> 59:31.380
I'm good, I promise you.

59:31.380 --> 59:33.580
I'm good in that
department, all right?

59:33.580 --> 59:36.380
I'm just-- No.

59:36.380 --> 59:37.780
I'm worried about how
I'll feel in the morning.

59:37.780 --> 59:40.020
Sore.

59:40.020 --> 59:41.300
Rich.

59:41.300 --> 59:44.300
Why don't we just
cut him in?

59:44.300 --> 59:45.380
All right.
Whatever works.

59:45.380 --> 59:47.060
Absolutely.

59:49.260 --> 59:52.140
But seven years is a
really long time, Nina.

59:52.140 --> 59:57.660
Let's just leave it that I decide
what I think is right, okay?

59:57.660 --> 59:59.140
Just get his
address for me.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.820
Okay.

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:07.620
All right.
Just breathe.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.100
Just like riding
a bike, Nina.

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.540
Just like riding a bike.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.260
Okay.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.340
You like riding a bike.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:18.900
You ain't rode a bike
in a while,

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:19.580
but it's gonna be okay.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:23.020
Hi.
- Hi.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:23.860
Hi there.

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:27.940
Wow.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.420
Um...

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.780
you mind if I come in?

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.460
It's--it's kinda late.

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.260
Um, maybe we could--

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.340
Barry, who is it?

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.460
I'm sorry. I didn't
know about your mom.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.540
She needs someone
to take care of her.

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:52.780
Um, maybe we could...

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.660
go out somewhere
sometime.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:56.740
Why?

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.860
Why?

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.260
Cards on the table, huh?

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:02.620
Don't you think?

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.780
What happened to us

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:11.340
is we found a way to
get what we wanted.

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.900
I mean, have you ever
thought about it?

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.540
What if you could have
what you wanted?

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:18.620
I think about it
all the time.

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:23.580
So what do you want?

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.340
Wow.

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.140
I'm so sorry.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.500
What the hell is
the matter with you?

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.540
I--I beg your pardon?

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:49.100
Are you demented?
That is a fantastic woman.

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.060
I know.

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.780
Well? Are you afraid of her?
- No.

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:55.300
I'm a little afraid
of you at the moment.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.140
I don't think you're gay.

01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.540
Thank you.

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.460
Yeah, so you get the girl,
you get the money.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:01.900
So what's the problem, huh?

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.500
Okay. He'll join up.
He wants a full share.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.700
He just doesn't want sex
with you to be part of the deal.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.020
You're kidding.

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:14.740
No.

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.420
It's possible I'm gonna
have a stroke,

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:19.540
and they're gonna find
the words "I told you so"

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:22.060
blocking the blood
to my brain.

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.900
He says you're worth
more than that.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.420
He said that?

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:29.220
Yes.

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.220
Oh, he sounds like
a great guy.

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.580
Yeah.

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.820
You should just tell him
that you really want to.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.140
Now?

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:40.740
Yeah.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.100
He probably thinks I'm--

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:45.940
I told Prince Charming
I'm a whore.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:47.540
He didn't say that.

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.140
I told him I'm a whore.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.700
No, no, no. Come on.
Nina, he didn't say that.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.420
Don't get neurotic. I mean, really.
- Yeah.

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:54.340
Okay, forget about it.
Okay, forget it.

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.300
All right?
We're back in business.

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.620
There's a random
search on Thursday.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:08.900
So Friday, yeah?

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:10.060
Works for me.

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.100
Okay, is that it, Friday?

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:12.300
Friday's good, right?
- Yes.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.860
This one's yours, right?

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.460
Yeah, thank you.

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:24.660
Look, I really
owe you an apology.

01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:27.020
You did what you
thought you had to.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:28.220
No.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:31.700
I'm not...like that.

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.980
And I know you
probably think that--

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.380
Maybe you got
the wrong message here.

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:38.940
I never said
I didn't want you.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.300
I just didn't want you
like that.

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:45.420
Well, look,
maybe we could just...

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.980
start from scratch.

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.380
Aah!
Oh, my God!

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.660
Oh!

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:14.940
Sorry.
- Excuse us.

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.540
No, no, that's fine.
I'm actually very sorry.

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.100
We'll be out in a minute.

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.420
No, no, please,
take your time.

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:23.460
Are you kidding me?
Everything's great.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:26.820
Yeah, we got federal crimes,
a house full of loot,

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.740
and now people having sex
in our closet.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.460
I know.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:33.220
Oh, come on, Bridget.

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.380
Are you really fine
with all this?

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:38.580
Well, actually, I'm sort of hoping
she'll finally lighten up a bit

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.180
and let us start spending
some of this money.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:43.620
What?

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.820
I don't know.
Maybe I just wanted a job.

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.340
What?

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:54.060
Actually, I thought
I was losing her.

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:55.900
And all I could
think of doing

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:59.380
was try to make her
need me again.

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:02.980
All right, everyone,
listen up.

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.860
What you need
is a boyfriend.

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:05.900
Hold up.
- Excuse me?

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:08.180
What you need
is to not--

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:09.300
A rich one.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:10.540
Someone who's
out of town a lot,

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.420
gets you gifts,

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:15.660
pays for your kids' tuition
at a fancy private school.

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:18.660
And what you need
is a job.

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:21.260
Hey, man,
I'm looking, all right?

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.100
Day trading, all right?
On-line.

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:25.580
If anybody asks, you're
into short-term futures.

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:27.180
If somebody
wants a tip

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:30.180
just tell them the market's
way too volatile.

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.820
Can you write that down?

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:32.740
Yes.

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.300
Barry,

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:36.380
your mom's gonna get
a big insurance settlement.

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.220
Huge.

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:39.900
Of course I will be doing

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.260
freelance corporate
consulting out of our house,

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:43.460
which we will have
to remodel.

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.460
Okay.
There you are.

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:47.340
We all have jobs
we need to do

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:48.300
or the appearance
thereof.

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:49.540
Isn't he just great?

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:53.460
Hot damn. We're finally
organized crime.

01:05:56.180 --> 01:06:00.820
<i># I used to go out
to parties #</i>

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.020
<i># And stand around #</i>

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:08.900
It's kinda hard to think
of ourselves as bank robbers.

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.220
<i># To really get down #</i>

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:15.980

<i># So somebody
could choose me #</i>

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.140
<i># No more standing #</i>

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:30.820
It got be kinda
like a job.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.060
Hmm.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:32.980
<i># Beside the wall #</i>

<i># Now I got myself

01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:40.420
Of course we had problems,
you know?

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.100
Like where to put it all.

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.580
<i># There's always a chance #</i>

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:54.500
We had it down

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.740
The perfect money machine.

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:01.300

oh, baby #</i>

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:03.500

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:21.220
Money...
...can buy you...

01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.540
happiness.

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.780
Don't let anybody
tell you different.

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:34.060
What is Marjorie
gonna say about that, huh?

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.220
Oh!

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.380
I am so happy for you!

01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:38.860
Are you?
Everything is wonderful.

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.780
Thank you.
Bridget, the good stuff.

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:42.380
The good stuff,
thank you.

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.700
The good stuff!
You're so funny!

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.100
Hi, Bridget.
- Hi. Hello.

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:52.780
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:55.340
Oh, hi!

01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:58.300
Oh, how are you?

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:03.740
Hey.
- Huh?

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:06.140
You having fun?
- Yeah.

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:07.580
You're not gonna believe this.
- What?

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.700
Tom Gaffney just
offered me a job.

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.020
Senior VP, head of
a division.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.700
They're impressed by how well
I've been doing as a consultant.

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:18.260
Take it, Don.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.899
You think?
- Yeah.

01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:24.020
Is it weird wanting to sit in an
office all day when you don't have to?

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:26.620
You're a manager.
You need something to manage.

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:28.260
It's a pay cut.

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:30.020
We're gonna have to pretend
to be living on less.

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.220
Yeah, I know.

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:33.020
You know,
you could quit.

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.180
Seriously.

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:35.779
I mean, we could
survive

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:38.380
being upper middle class
for a while, right?

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.660
Honey, I don't know.

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:43.140
I hate cleaning toilets,
but the money is so good.

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.620
Well, think about it.

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:51.740
Do you know that guy?

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.100
No. Why?

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.300
I don't know.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.300
Oh, my God!

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:02.540
Oh! This is
so exciting!

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:07.460
Oh, my God!
- Thank you.

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:10.660
Thanks.
- Ring, ring, ring!

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:12.420
Good for you guys.

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:14.939
Oh, that's great.

01:09:14.939 --> 01:09:16.100
Yes, girl! Uh-huh!

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.779
Green-level
employees,

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:20.819
like this
young lady here,

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:24.140
are not allowed
in red-level areas.

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:27.100
Transitions to
red-badge areas

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.660
are modeled after Federal
maximum security prisons.

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.340
...red IDs to ascend
beyond the cameras.

01:09:38.899 --> 01:09:40.660
It was that guy...

01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:43.060
showing up.

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:44.620
The thing about
a perfect machine, though,

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:48.380
is you drop in
one loose screw...

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.979
Bam!

01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:51.100
Oh! Jesus!

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.100
I just came from
the loading dock.

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.140
I was dropping off
a cart,

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.100
when all of
a sudden,

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.340
Glover comes
out of nowhere--

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.700
Aah!
- Aah!

01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:58.220
Shh!
- Quiet!

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:04.860
Just be quiet.
Just be quiet.

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:09.420
Okay.

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:13.020
What did you mean,
"We're busted"?

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.940
This guy was looking
at me very strangely.

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:22.060
I take my feelings
seriously .

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:25.660
Okay, Jackie, but let's
try not to panic, okay?

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:28.900
Yeah, yeah. You said you
never saw him before, right?

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:30.340
You don't know why
he could be here.

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:31.980
It could be nothing.

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.820
It is not nothing.

01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:38.260
All right, we're just going
to try and find out, all right?

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:39.420
Okay?

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.300
All right.

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.420
Okay.

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:54.820
Ah! Service employees who
need access to red-level areas

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.900
are given yellow
I.D. badges.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.220
A yellow badge is only
allowed in secure areas

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:02.660
under red-level
supervision.

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:05.380
Yellow badge employees are
given a rigorous screening

01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:07.140
in national
databanks

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.140
for criminal
and psychiatric history.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.700
It turns out
they're all crazy.

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.180
That's a joke.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.260
Whoa, whoa.

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:22.780
Aah!

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:23.820
Whoopsie!

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:31.860
Oh, I think we're all safe
in this room, don't you?

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.620
Uh-huh.

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:34.820
Let's go right. Moving on.

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:38.460
Step right this way.

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.060
So as you can see,

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:43.260
there is simply no
opportunity for theft,

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:45.500
which is why there's
never been a theft

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:48.340
of even a single note
at this facility

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:49.500
and there never will be.

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.260
Right.

01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:55.100
Look,

01:11:55.100 --> 01:12:00.020
these are not
white-collar people.

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.020
They would have to
physically steal the money,

01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:03.540
which I just told you
is impossible.

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.060
You're talking about
women who...

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:06.900
change trash bags.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:09.140
They push carts around,

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:13.980
drop paper in a hole
eight hours a day.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.420
You got to admit it's
kind of impressive, though.

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.140
Impressive?

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:18.380
Yeah, I mean, these people
have managed to acquire

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.380
enormous sums of
unaccounted for cash,

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.620
and no one can
figure out how.

01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:25.020
Isn't that odd? Are you
a little curious about that?

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:27.900
Yes. So what we need to
do is get the KCPD on them,

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:29.220
find out what
they're up to.

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.460
We have...for months.

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:35.620
You've been watching
them for months...

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:36.980
and nobody told me?

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:39.980
Yeah. We believe one of your
staff has been compromised.

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:42.420
We had to assume the entire
security squad was corrupt.

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:45.460
How the hell dare you come
in here slinging allegations

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:47.580
when you have nothing?

01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:49.060
No evidence.

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:50.900
They could have gotten this
money any number of ways.

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.900
They--they could be involved
with drugs, computer crime?

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:56.500
Well, they could have gotten
it turning in cans for deposit,

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.060
but they work at a bank.

01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.500
Actually, your bank.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.100
You listen to me.

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:04.140
I run the tightest lockdown
this side of Fort Knox!

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:06.020
And until you can
prove otherwise,

01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:09.420
you get your glorified
paper-pushing ass out of here

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.620
and let some real men
do their damn jobs!

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:17.980
You know, I hope for
your sake you're right,

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:20.780
and I hope this place is as airtight
as you seem to wanna believe it is,

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:23.180
and I hope that you're
not a part of a conspiracy

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:24.620
to steal from
the Federal Government,

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:25.980
because that
would be a crime

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:28.780
punishable to the fullest
extent of the law.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:30.060
You will be
held accountable.

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.300
He's a Federal Bank
examiner.

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:40.100
Mindy Arbogast called
of course.

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:41.740
He's talking to
all of our neighbors.

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:43.740
What was he asking?

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:46.580
How we make our money.
What I do for a living.

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.820
Are you sure it's
the same guy from the party?

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.140
Yes. Yes, I am sure it's
the guy from the party.

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:52.500
All right.
What we need to do

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.900
is we need to talk
to a lawyer.

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:54.900
We'll give ourselves up.

01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.500
We are not going
to do that. Mm-mmm.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.060
No. No, no, honey,
listen to me.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:02.060
Look, we still have most
of the money, right?

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.220
So we'll give it back,

01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:05.140
and we'll negotiate
some kind of,

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.420
you know,
suspended sentences

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:07.700
or something like that,
all right?

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:10.300
Don, I can't do that.
We cannot do that.

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:12.020
Bridget, please.
Look...

01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:13.620
We have so few
cards to play.

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.540
Honey, it's not
shoplifting.

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:17.940
It's a federal crime.

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:22.060
Don! We can't turn
ourselves in because...

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.700
they're gonna take
Nina's kids away.

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:32.300
And, uh...

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:33.500
she'd kill me.

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:39.420
No. Bob...

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:41.420
it is not a surveillance blimp.

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:43.260
<i>Don?</i>

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:44.660
<i>Don't worry.
I'll call you right back.</i>

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.180
I'm going to jail.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.820
No. No.
No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:01.580
I am telling you
if they had any evidence,

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.380
they would have
arrested us already,

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:04.900
and they're
just fishing.

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.900
So I'm saying
we were careful, correct?

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:10.020
Everybody spent within
the cover stories, right?

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:12.540
Do investments count
as spending?

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.260
What investments?

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.500
You said be
a day trader.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.860
No, we didn't.
Oh, boy!

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:21.500
We said pretend to be a day trader.
- Yeah.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.540
Well, I was...

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.380
you know, getting
into character, right?

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:26.460
And I set up
this portfolio.

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.180
The Bob Fund.

01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:29.260
Oh, good God!
- And, uh...

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:32.460
I am making 17%.

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:36.300
Did you ever invest amounts
greater than $10,000 at one time?

01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:37.900
Oh, hell yeah!
- You did.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.860
Like big mondo
chunks, man!

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.740
Yeah, totally!

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:44.340
I'm looking to make
the large green, hombre.

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:46.300
You think I like thinking
of my wife on her feet

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:49.500
from nine to five every day
ripping off the government?

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:54.300
This is bad, right?

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.820
Transactions
over $10,000

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:00.460
are automatically
reported to the IRS!

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:01.780
How many times
do I have to say that?

01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:03.420
Well, I didn't--
I didn't know that.

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:07.740
Look, you cannot blame me
for things I didn't know.

01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:08.700
That would not
be fair.

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:10.420
All right, look,

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.540
it doesn't prove
one thing.

01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:14.860
They can't arrest us
without evidence.

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:17.340
What about the piles of
cash in our houses?

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:20.220
I mean, you don't think that
might be a little problem?

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.340
Uh, well--

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:22.700
We're gonna have to
get rid of it...tonight.

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:24.980
No. We'll take it
with us.

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.300
We'll run. We'll get
new identities.

01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:28.460
Good.
- No. Shut up, will you?

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:29.340
What do you mean run?
To where?

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.420
What so we tell our kids?

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.740
Like they ever call us?

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:34.660
It's too late.
- They're already watching us.

01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.580
There was blimp over our house.
- Bob!

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:40.580
Come on.

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:43.340
Bridget, please.

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:44.740
We worked so hard.

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:47.580
And that's it?

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:48.500
Whew!

01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:53.220
We'll be all right.
We'll be all right.

01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:54.660
She'll--she'll do it...
really.

01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:56.900
Did you say 17%?

01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:58.420
17%.

01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.740
My God,
that's unbelievable.

01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:04.180
What, are you mad, babe?

01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:07.580
This is crazy.

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:09.380
Listen, Nina,

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.940
I know cops from work,

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:14.380
how they do things.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.020
What happens when they
don't have enough evidence

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:18.780
is they try and get one of us
to roll over against the other,

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:20.900
testify.

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:24.460
The thing is
they only need one.

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:27.740
Whoever rolls over first
gets the deal.

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:30.060
First-time offender,
single mom,

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:34.100
they might deal you down to
probation if you roll now, alone.

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.500
I can't--
I can't do that.

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:37.780
We're all grownups here.

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:40.700
We did what we did.

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:43.580
The boys...

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.500
you should know
how it works.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.940
We could do it, you know.

01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:54.780
Get away.

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:58.300
I don't want to.

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.460
No?

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:01.940
I mean, I'm sorry,
but I--

01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:05.220
I can't live with it just hanging
over us the rest of our life.

01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:06.700
I'm not sorry
we did it,

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:09.740
but I really...

01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:11.060
I'd really like this
part to be over.

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:24.020
Hang on.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:25.700
Yeah, we are in
a police state.

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:26.940
No, we're not
in a police state.

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:29.220
<i>Yeah, we are.
It's like 1989.</i>

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.060
What?

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.020
No!
Oh, no!

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.340
God, what an idiot.

01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.380
Honey, I need more.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.500
Mom?

01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:56.340
Okay.

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:58.260
Shh. Quiet.
Shh. Rufus.

01:19:58.260 --> 01:19:59.020
Good Rufus.

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:06.660
Okay. They're
on the move.

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:23.460
Wow.

01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:27.420
Beautiful, doll.

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:31.660
Uh-oh.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.260
<i>This is the police.
Stop your vehicle.</i>

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:39.700
<i>...stop your vehicle.</i>

01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:41.140
<i>Exit with your hands
above your head.</i>

01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:42.900
Now we're under
surveillance.

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.540
Freeze!
KCPD!

01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:57.100
Keep your hands
where we can see 'em!

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:05.740
Freeze!
KCPD! Drop it!

01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:08.860
Drop it!

01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:13.740
Hold it!
Don't you move!

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:15.500
Mom, what's going on?

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:16.940
Stay in the house, boys.
Mom?

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:22.860
We're going in.
You stay put.

01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:36.180
Wow.
Nice house.

01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:38.860
Kansas City Police!

01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:41.300
Up here.

01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:56.940
Hi.

01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:58.980
Um...

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.420
I don't suppose anyone's
seen my wife.

01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:04.860
No?

01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:08.820
Okay...

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:11.700
Miss...Capone.

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:12.740
King room,
no smoking.

01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:14.580
You'll be putting this
on which card?

01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:16.260
I'm paying in cash.

01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:18.100
We still need a credit
card for incidentals.

01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:22.660
There won't be
any incidents,

01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:23.260
will there?

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:26.140
No, ma'am.

01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.980
Room 412.

01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:30.700
Right through there.

01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:37.300
You need to
help yourself here.

01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:39.260
Yeah, well, I want
to see a lawyer.

01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:42.460
<i>Donde my abogato. </i>

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:45.420
Just tell us
how they did it.

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:48.180
Did you hear me?

01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:50.260
Lawyer.

01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:55.740
L-a-y...

01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:59.380
w...e...r.

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.100
She left you, man.

01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:06.500
Your wife
ditched you.

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:07.980
What are you gonna
do about that?

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.980
Wish her well?

01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:14.340
Your children are at
the Child Welfare offices.

01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.500
When you're indicted,

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.860
we'll put them into
the foster care system.

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:21.260
Now, the district
attorney can help you

01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:22.500
if you help him.

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.220
Hi.

01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:31.500
Hey.

01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:35.220
How much?

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.020
How much what?

01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:39.420
How much did you take?

01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:41.740
I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:44.580
Why? How much
do you think I took?

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:46.420
We have no idea.

01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:48.180
Really?
That's right.

01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:50.100
You don't know?
- Nope.

01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:52.580
Oh. Good.

01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.900
You can't arrest me.

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:00.540
You're a bank examiner.

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.300
That's right.
- Right.

01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.740
Well, you've done
your homework.

01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:05.020
What do you want?

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:07.740
I guess I wanna know
what makes someone like you

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:10.140
decide to do
something like this?

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:13.260
Well, I have a theory.
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:15.780
Crime is contagious.

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:20.300
Oh, brother.

01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:23.620
He is a piece of work.

01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.260
Oh, yeah.
Look in the camera.

01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:28.860
<i>Greetings, Earthlings.</i>

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:32.620
You know those two
amazing women-- amazing--

01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:33.900
that they just arrested,

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:37.980
and--and their families
and my husband?

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.300
They never really
had a shot.

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:44.060
I mean, they kept trying,
and they did their best,

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.980
but what did they
really get out of it?

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:48.260
A gigantic
untraceable fortune.

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:52.620
Prove it.

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:14.860
Hello?

01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:22.740
I've been told
you want a deal.

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.180
Yes.

01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:27.620
It should have been
a little faster.

01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:30.980
Who?

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:31.700
The girl.

01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:38.820
Kind of a
hinky plea bargain.

01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:42.500
She says the deal is
you get the walk.

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:45.100
Full immunity.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:46.540
She tells us
everything

01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:48.620
if you get to go home
to your kids.

01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.740
Go figure people.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.460
What do you want?
Bridget, I didn't--

01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.100
I need a lawyer.

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:09.780
I don't do
criminal work, Bridget.

01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:17.300
You take that out of
this house this minute.

01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:18.460
You know, not everybody
is like you.

01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.860
Some of us have morals
and standards--

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:21.140
Shut up, Mindy!

01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:24.420
I'm a tax attorney.

01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:27.660
I know that.

01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:29.620
Excuse me.

01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:31.060
What's going on here?

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:32.140
Was she represented?

01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:33.860
Deal's done.

01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:35.820
I am this woman's
attorney.

01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:37.300
You're what?

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:38.420
The deal wasn't with her.

01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:39.900
It was with one of
the other suspects.

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:41.460
I represent them all.

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:43.780
And I need to confer
with my clients...now.

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:50.740
Wait right here.

01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:05.900
You have no case
against my clients.

01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:08.140
We have a confession.

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:09.660
She'll recant.

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.380
They all will.

01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:12.940
What about the money,
the cars, the houses?

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.620
There's no law against
having money.

01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:16.620
Can you prove they stole it?

01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:17.860
Of course
they stole it.

01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:21.220
Did they?

01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:24.100
These women robbed
your bank for three years

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:25.620
without setting off
a single alarm?

01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:28.140
Is that what happened,
Mr. Glover?

01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:31.820
According
to our records,

01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:34.660
all currency that was
due to be destroyed...

01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:36.140
was destroyed.

01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:42.860
The Fed is a totally
secure institution.

01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:48.540
We watch everyone...

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:50.460
everywhere...

01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:51.980
every minute.

01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:58.100
It is impossible to remove
currency from our system.

01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:05.620
There's no evidence the crime
was even committed.

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:08.060
You should never
have arrested them.

01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:10.980
Not so fast,
counselor.

01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:12.180
IRS.

01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:16.860
Ever hear of U.S. Code
Section 7201?

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:23.500
Yeah.

01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:29.180
Well, Bridget,
you were right.

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:30.340
You didn't pay taxes.

01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:31.900
On stolen money?

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:34.220
I didn't hear that.

01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:37.940
The IRS is offering
what I consider...

01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:38.700
a good deal.

01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:41.620
No jail time.

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:43.700
Oh! Oh, thank you!

01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:47.180
But the fines and the penalties
will wipe you out.

01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:49.180
You can walk away
from this if...

01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:51.460
you walk empty-handed.

01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:06.260
I didn't think we'd
be coming out of there.

01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:08.900
Christ, Arbogast,
he is so good.

01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:10.420
I had no idea.

01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:31.300
You didn't really think that I
would leave you in there, did you?

01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:32.900
Yeah.

01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:37.380
One hell of a ride, huh?

01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:39.460
Yeah.

01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:40.700
Hell of a ride.

01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:46.060
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:48.180
Bye, Nina.
Barry.

01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:51.020
Come on, boys.

01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:22.700
Hey, Junior.
- Hey, hey.

01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:23.620
Long time no see.

01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:25.620
I know. The place
is looking nice.

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:26.740
Yes, it is,
isn't it?

01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:38.580
Hey, Bridget.

01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.180
Oh!

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.260
Jackie!
- Jackie!

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:48.820
How you doing, girl?
I've missed you.

01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:50.980
How was the honeymoon?

01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:52.300
Was it?
Yeah, tell.

01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:55.380
Two very fine days.

01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:58.100
That's it.

01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:00.260
Oh, and the five of us crammed
up in that tiny apartment.

01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:03.260
Boy, you really got have
a good sense of humor.

01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:05.460
And we got
the two incomes, so...

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:06.700
I can't complain.

01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:08.140
Wow.
- Wow.

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:13.300
Well, Bob got his job back.
- Okay!

01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:14.980
And I'm waitressing.

01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:17.140
And we figure
in five years,

01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:18.540
we're going
to South America.

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:19.660
We're driving all
the way to the bottom.

01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:21.020
There you go.

01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:23.660
Junior--
- There you go, ladies.

01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:26.420
This one's
on the house.

01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:27.820
Like old times.

01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:28.940
No shit.

01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:31.620
We're going back to...

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:33.260
work?

01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:36.580
Bob has access
to a lot of beef.

01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:39.820
No. No.

01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:41.700
No.

01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:42.980
Okay.
- Yes, no.

01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:44.340
Okay.

01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:46.180
But we're moving.

01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:47.940
To the Caribbean.

01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:49.300
We're gonna open a little
bed-and-breakfast.

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:50.860
I'm gonna cook.

01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:52.180
Don's gonna manage it
of course.

01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:53.740
We've been talking
about this for years.

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:55.380
But we're just
kinda waiting

01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:56.860
until it's not..,
so hot.

01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:00.060
Hot?

01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:02.220
It's chilly out.

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:03.940
Yeah.

01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:06.500
Hey, wait. Did you ever hear
that expression "mad money?"

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:08.500
My mother used to say,
"Every woman should keep

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:10.860
a little mad money
tucked away just in case."

01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:14.220
Do you use mad money
when you go mad

01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:16.940
or when you get mad?

01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:20.060
Why don't you
decide for yourself?

01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.260
Junior?

01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:22.220
Uh-huh!
- Come on.

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:25.700
Watch your step.

01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:27.900
Do you know?
- No.

01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:30.940
What are you up to?
Why are we down here?

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:33.300
Relax. You just have to
have a little patience.

01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:36.940
Does this
look familiar?

01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:39.660
Oh!

01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:47.620
Holy shit!
- Oh!

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:50.420
Who did it?
- I did! Me!

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:56.740
Oh, my God!

01:32:56.740 --> 01:33:00.820
You sneaky
criminal mastermind!
