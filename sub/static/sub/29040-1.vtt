00:17.918 --> 00:18.752
- Jeremy

00:19.820 --> 00:21.255
Jeremy, wake up.

00:52.120 --> 00:52.953
Come on

00:54.288 --> 00:55.623
let's go to bed.

00:58.226 --> 01:01.061
(heavy breathing)

01:02.296 --> 01:05.299
* Let's go outside

01:06.334 --> 01:09.770
* And talk to the birds

01:10.938 --> 01:15.243
* I heard there
 was something bout

01:15.243 --> 01:18.146
* Not being heard

01:19.747 --> 01:23.083
* And we talked

01:23.083 --> 01:27.155
* All through the night.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.923
* We talked all

01:31.925 --> 01:35.095
* Through the night.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.534
* Let's go outside

01:41.835 --> 01:45.173
* And play in the grass

01:46.440 --> 01:50.778
* We can plant chestnuts then

01:50.778 --> 01:54.382
* And hope that they root

01:55.416 --> 01:58.719
* And we played

01:58.719 --> 02:02.590
* All through the night

02:02.590 --> 02:05.259
* We played

02:05.259 --> 02:07.628
* All

02:07.628 --> 02:10.631
* Through the night

02:13.066 --> 02:16.069
* Let's go outside

02:17.371 --> 02:20.641
* And cry in the dark

02:21.942 --> 02:26.280
* We can hide nothing there

02:26.280 --> 02:30.918
* Except being (inaudible lyric)

02:30.918 --> 02:34.222
* And we cried

02:34.222 --> 02:38.125
* All through the night

02:38.125 --> 02:41.061
* We cried

02:41.061 --> 02:45.233
* All through the night

02:50.003 --> 02:53.407
- Didn't you take
 Math 33 last quarter?

02:54.475 --> 02:55.309
- Yeah.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.143
Yeah.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.214
- You never showed up
 after the first week.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.549
- I had to drop it.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.317
I got really swamped
 with my other classes.

03:03.317 --> 03:07.921
- Oh, that's happened to
me way too many times.

03:07.921 --> 03:08.756
Scott.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.158
- I'm Jeremy.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.160
- Can I sit?

03:13.160 --> 03:13.994
- Sure.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.305
- I don't mean to be weird but

03:24.305 --> 03:25.739
the first couple of days
that you were in class

03:25.739 --> 03:29.543
I kind of thought that
 maybe you were staring at me

03:29.543 --> 03:33.714
or was it the guy next to
 me that caught your eye?

03:35.148 --> 03:36.750
- It was you.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.851
- I knew it.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.355
- You just reminded
 me of somebody.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.189
- Who?

03:44.091 --> 03:45.293
- My roommate.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.594
- Dorm roommate?

03:46.594 --> 03:47.861
- No, I live off campus.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.096
- Oh, me too.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.798
Yeah, I got a great
 place near campus.

03:50.798 --> 03:51.832
I love waking up late

03:51.832 --> 03:53.801
walking no class no rush.

03:53.801 --> 03:54.635
- Yeah.

03:54.635 --> 03:55.836
- Yeah.

03:55.836 --> 03:56.770
- Pretty lucky.

03:56.770 --> 03:57.605
- Yeah.

04:00.107 --> 04:03.277
I just started
 learning how to cook.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.546
(Scott laughs)

04:05.546 --> 04:10.518
I was wondering if you wanted
 to come over for dinner?

04:10.518 --> 04:11.719
- Maybe another time.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.220
- Come on I make this
 great pasta dish.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.923
Come on guaranteed
 you'll love it.

04:15.923 --> 04:19.159
- Thanks but I should probably

04:19.159 --> 04:21.228
Just I should probably
 - [Scott] No, no take

04:21.228 --> 04:22.930
one bite of my gourmet cooking.

04:22.930 --> 04:23.864
- Gourmet.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.165
- Yeah.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.600
- I thought you said
 you just started.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.169
- I learn fast and
 if you don't like it

04:29.169 --> 04:33.341
then I'll take you to any
 restaurant you pick, okay?

04:36.043 --> 04:36.877
- Okay.

04:36.877 --> 04:40.314
- All right (laughing).

04:41.449 --> 04:43.283
Made it from scratch.

04:48.889 --> 04:49.723
- Thanks.

04:56.597 --> 04:57.431
Mm,

04:59.400 --> 05:01.569
this is delicious.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.236
- Always is.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.472
- Wow,

05:04.472 --> 05:06.640
it seems like you want
 a career as a chef.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.475
- No,

05:07.475 --> 05:09.443
only as a hobby.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.612
See what I'm really
 into is engineering

05:11.612 --> 05:13.814
like mechanical engineering like

05:13.814 --> 05:16.750
love machines making
 them work perfectly.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.952
What are you into?

05:18.952 --> 05:19.787
- Um,

05:21.589 --> 05:24.425
just having a nice quiet life

05:24.425 --> 05:25.993
I guess.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.895
- No, I meant like
 what do you study?

05:27.895 --> 05:30.230
- Oh, linguistics.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.533
- I don't know
 anything about that.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.802
- Um, just basically
 the study of language

05:34.802 --> 05:37.905
how it's formed,
 how it's structured.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.407
Yeah.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.375
- All right, what kind of
 jobs are there for that?

05:41.375 --> 05:42.776
- Not that many.

05:44.211 --> 05:47.247
But I mean you know if I get
 into a really good grad school

05:47.247 --> 05:49.550
then I'll probably find a job.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.285
But I have to get my GPA way up.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.155
I'll find a job.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.393
- You know I got something
 that would go perfect

05:59.393 --> 06:00.193
with this pasta.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.662
You're gonna love it.

06:01.662 --> 06:02.496
- Okay.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.740
- No wine for me.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.409
- You don't like wine?

06:15.409 --> 06:16.644
- No, I do.

06:16.644 --> 06:19.947
No, I really like it I just um

06:19.947 --> 06:21.148
Not tonight.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.750
- Why?

06:22.750 --> 06:24.752
- Uh, I got my reasons.

06:33.461 --> 06:36.063
Look I should've told you this.

06:37.364 --> 06:38.265
My roommate

06:39.867 --> 06:41.401
he's uh

06:41.401 --> 06:44.371
He's not just my roommate.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.839
- Oh.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.074
- I mean he's been telling
 me we should break up.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.542
He wants to end it
 then he doesn't.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.478
And he says he's just trying
 to get over his issues.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.980
- Yeah, everybody has issues.

06:55.148 --> 06:58.986
- Yeah, well, his issues
 just happen to be other guys.

06:58.986 --> 06:59.820
- Oh.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.590
- But you know he says
 a lot of couples have

07:02.590 --> 07:04.257
open relationships.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.259
But then he comes back to me

07:06.259 --> 07:07.961
and he apologizes for days

07:07.961 --> 07:09.697
and says he won't do it again

07:09.697 --> 07:12.132
and tells me he loves me and

07:13.734 --> 07:16.604
- How long you been with the

07:16.604 --> 07:17.671
- Elliot.
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

07:17.671 --> 07:18.839
Um, two years.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.210
Yeah, two really good years.

07:25.378 --> 07:29.583
Yeah, he's the only guy
I've ever been with.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.752
- You wanna change that?

07:33.521 --> 07:36.123
- Maybe I don't know.

07:36.123 --> 07:39.192
(slow somber music)

07:57.210 --> 07:59.046
[Jeremy] Oh, man, oh.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.418
- [Scott] You want
 me to keep going?

08:05.418 --> 08:07.187
- No, no, I'm sorry.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.557
- [Scott] Really?

08:09.557 --> 08:10.390
- Yeah.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.325
I'm sorry.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.128
- [Scott] No problem.

08:18.532 --> 08:22.703
It's always better
 whenever you're sure.

08:22.703 --> 08:23.971
To being sure.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.476
- I better go.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.312
- Right.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.716
You wanna take home some pasta.

08:35.716 --> 08:38.719
I'll put it in a
 container for you.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.627
(birds chirping)

09:00.073 --> 09:00.841
- Elliot.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.015
Elliot.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.160
(phone ringing)

09:21.328 --> 09:22.763
- [Voiceover] Hey,
 leave a message

09:22.763 --> 09:25.332
and I'll get back to
 you as soon as I can.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.334
(beep)

10:00.067 --> 10:02.469
- Beautiful California here.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.172
- Hey.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.641
(laughing) Don't be shy.

10:07.641 --> 10:08.475
Hey, Rachael.

10:08.475 --> 10:09.710
Hey, Gavin.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.878
- Hey, mom.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.545
- Hope you're
 having a great time.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.047
God knows we are.

10:17.584 --> 10:20.353
- [Jeremy] We're gonna go
 on the Ferris Wheel later.

10:20.353 --> 10:23.691
(slow tempo drum beat)

10:48.348 --> 10:49.182
- Hi.

10:50.617 --> 10:51.451
- Hi

10:55.088 --> 10:55.923
- Jeremy.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.795
- I don't wanna hear it.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.196
- Let me explain.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.167
I'm just not ready to be in

11:07.167 --> 11:10.103
an exclusive kind
 of relationship.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.439
It isn't fair to you or me.

11:14.808 --> 11:19.112
We're way too young to
 know what we really want.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.581
- You sure about that?

11:21.581 --> 11:22.415
- Yes.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.288
- Then you should move out.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.360
- Jeremy, I love you.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.464
- I don't wanna hear it.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.299
- Come on look at me.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.770
Don't you believe me?

11:42.770 --> 11:43.603
- No.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.176
- All right I guess

11:50.277 --> 11:52.179
I guess I'll move out.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.382
Love you.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.175
(water running)

12:35.155 --> 12:37.424
- Is everything okay?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.559
- I hope you're hungry.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.495
- I was just about
 to start cooking.

12:42.495 --> 12:46.466
That's not the leftovers
that I gave you.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.635
- I made it from scratch.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.575
Maybe we could try it
 with some of the wine

12:55.575 --> 12:57.410
you said was so good.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.948
- I've got a couple bottles.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.118
- That should just about do it.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.787
- Oh (laughter)

13:09.089 --> 13:10.023
enter, sir.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.815
(heavy breathing)

13:41.588 --> 13:44.191
Want me to take off my shirt?

13:45.825 --> 13:46.659
- Yeah.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.501
- [Scott] I got the
 drawer full of Bull.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.337
(birds chirping)

14:01.774 --> 14:04.377
- Hey, Rachael. Hey, Gavin.
 - [Jeremy] Hey, mom.

14:04.377 --> 14:07.214
- Hope you're
 having a great time.

14:10.817 --> 14:14.621
- They used to look
 so happy together.

14:14.621 --> 14:18.291
- Jeremy acted happy
 so you wouldn't worry.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.129
He wouldn't talk about it but

14:22.129 --> 14:25.798
I knew there was
 something wrong with them.

14:27.935 --> 14:30.303
- He looks happy with this one.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.939
- Hey, mom,

14:31.939 --> 14:32.772
dad

14:35.175 --> 14:36.343
check it out.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.913
- I know I'm sure
 as hell am happy.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.049
He's gonna be an engineer.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.150
- Job security.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.651
- Yes, thank God.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.223
- [Scott] Hey.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.359
- So this is the guy.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.027
- I'm the guy, hey.

14:55.695 --> 14:56.663
- He's pretty cool.

14:56.663 --> 15:00.033
(electronic dance music)

15:00.033 --> 15:02.769
(inaudible dialog)

15:02.769 --> 15:05.272
(girl laughs)

15:07.640 --> 15:09.909
- All right, pour me some.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.638
- [Female} He
 looks like an angel

15:38.638 --> 15:40.073
just like me.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.509
- There's angels everywhere.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.579
- [Male Partygoer] Hey, see you.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.221
You are so cute.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.289
- And you are so buzzed.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.691
Oh, I'm just getting started

15:58.691 --> 16:00.493
but I do have an idea.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.301
- Hey, I'll be back.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.302
- Don't go.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.340
- [Scott] Hey, what
the hell are you doing?

16:13.340 --> 16:15.575
- [Male Partygoer] Hey,
 Scott, I was just telling your

16:15.575 --> 16:17.777
very cute boyfriend
that it would be so nice

16:17.777 --> 16:20.180
to see you on the
 left side of the bed

16:20.180 --> 16:21.581
him on the right

16:23.516 --> 16:25.852
and me right in the middle.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.656
- Is that what you want?

16:29.656 --> 16:30.523
- He's just buzzed.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.725
He's only joking.

16:32.725 --> 16:36.829
- [Male Partygoer]
 No, I'm very serious.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.831
- Thanks but no thanks.

16:40.633 --> 16:44.637
- Male Partygoer] Okay,
I'm not going anywhere.

16:45.772 --> 16:49.109
(slow ringing tone]

16:49.109 --> 16:52.379
(pulsating drum beat)

16:55.748 --> 16:59.252
- [Voiceover] Something's
 wrong with them.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.689
Something's wrong with him.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.590
(electronic dance music)

17:04.590 --> 17:06.759
- Let's go home.

17:06.759 --> 17:07.926
- You tired?

17:08.828 --> 17:10.896
- Not at all, not tired at all.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.765
- Neither am I.

17:12.765 --> 17:13.599
Come on.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.414
(slow mellow tone)

17:37.324 --> 17:40.827
(inaudible mumbled voice)

17:49.369 --> 17:52.972
(faint voices whispering)

18:01.381 --> 18:04.384
(slow mellow tone)

18:29.108 --> 18:30.710
- You should wear
 something different.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.779
- I told 'em plenty of
 times that these are

18:32.779 --> 18:34.247
cheap, they're easy to clean,

18:34.247 --> 18:36.483
and they look good enough.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.553
- You think I should wear a tie?

18:40.553 --> 18:41.388
- No.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.360
There's nothing to worry about.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.263
(doorbell chimes)

18:56.068 --> 18:57.404
- [Scott] Hey.

18:57.404 --> 18:58.571
- [Bill] Hey.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.280
- Hope traffic wasn't too bad.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.781
- [Bill] It was bad.

19:08.781 --> 19:12.219
- Yeah, well, you made it
 here on time dinner's ready.

19:12.219 --> 19:13.720
- Happy birthday.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.156
- Hello, sir.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.592
- Sir, I think you're uh

19:19.592 --> 19:22.094
making your friend nervous.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.696
- I'm not nervous.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.598
- Right.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.167
Something smells good.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.570
- I showed Jeremy how
 to make your favorite.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.339
- [Bill] My son's a good cook.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.806
I hope you are too.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.107
- [Scott] Dad, you
 mind if I open this?

19:35.107 --> 19:37.610
- [Bill] Yeah, yeah go ahead.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.455
- [Scott] Thank you.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.056
- Okay, let's eat.

19:56.496 --> 20:00.166
So, Jeremy, do your
folks live around here.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.136
- We're from New Hampshire.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.205
- That's far away.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.374
- His folks will
 be here in a month.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.309
They want to meet me.

20:09.309 --> 20:12.144
- So they know
 all about you two.

20:13.413 --> 20:17.384
- Yeah, they have
 no problem with us.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.786
You have a problem with us?

20:23.523 --> 20:25.725
- When do you finish school?

20:25.725 --> 20:26.793
- Next year.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.696
- Scott will be done this year.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.564
He's got engineering jobs
 waiting all over the place

20:31.564 --> 20:32.765
Texas, Oregon.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.667
- I don't think
 I'll be doing that.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.803
- You're taking
 one of those jobs.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.339
- I'm gonna finish my
 Master's here first.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.773
I don't know it depends.

20:40.773 --> 20:41.741
- It depends on what?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.643
- A lot of things.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.378
- Scott, those kind of offers

20:45.378 --> 20:47.013
they don't come
 around every day.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.014
- I know.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.282
- I don't think you do.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.850
- I can do whatever I want

20:50.850 --> 20:52.118
that's what you
 don't understand.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.620
It's my decision.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.856
- Yes, it is.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.261
Time to hit the road.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.830
- You can't drive back tonight.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.832
- [Bill] I got a job
 to finish tomorrow.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.199
I can't be losing customers.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.200
Good night.

21:13.005 --> 21:16.609
- [Scott] What the
hell is wrong with you.

21:21.314 --> 21:24.817
(electronic dance music)

21:45.905 --> 21:46.739
- Scott.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.524
You gotta get more sleep.

22:04.524 --> 22:05.725
- This is the best
 work I've ever done.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.627
Check it out.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.729
- It's a lot of numbers.

22:12.865 --> 22:15.535
- I told you math was my thing.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.044
It's not right.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.280
It's absolutely not right.

22:30.149 --> 22:34.320
I got a lot of studying to
 do just let me finish this.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.060
You'll figure this out.

22:41.060 --> 22:41.961
You will figure this out.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.463
You'll figure this out.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.764
You'll figure this out.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.165
You'll figure this out.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.867
You'll figure it out.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.769
You'll figure this out.

22:52.839 --> 22:56.242
(faint ominous laughter)

23:09.989 --> 23:11.057
- Hey, Scott.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.160
What's the matter.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.097
- Man, we need to
 get some more wine

23:18.097 --> 23:19.599
a whole lot more.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.902
Some fine wine.

23:24.671 --> 23:27.440
- You studied all week for this.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.443
- The professor's out to get me.

23:30.443 --> 23:33.279
I know he's talking
 behind my back

23:34.280 --> 23:35.448
that asshole.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.821
Can't concentrate.

23:44.090 --> 23:47.159
- That's 'cause you're
 not sleeping enough.

23:47.159 --> 23:47.994
- Yeah.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.831
- Here come here.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.433
Come here.

24:03.409 --> 24:06.913
(faint voices whispering)

24:08.314 --> 24:10.249
(sinister laughter)

24:10.249 --> 24:12.785
My parents will
 be here tomorrow.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.854
Let's go get some sleep.

24:23.796 --> 24:27.867
- [Rachael] So your father
 found this great restaurant.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.201
- [Gavin] If your friend
doesn't show up soon

24:29.201 --> 24:31.337
we're gonna lose or reservation.

24:31.337 --> 24:33.005
- [Jeremy] He should
 be here any minute.

24:33.005 --> 24:33.940
- [Rachael] Well,
 if he's too busy

24:33.940 --> 24:35.975
we can meet him tomorrow.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.611
- [Jeremy] No, he's just
 been studying a lot lately.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.312
He's got a few tests

24:40.312 --> 24:42.582
but he really wanted
 to meet you guys

24:42.582 --> 24:45.184
before he gets even busier.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.319
(knocking)

24:47.319 --> 24:49.488
- Oh, that should be him.

24:51.023 --> 24:53.860
(slow dramatic music)

24:53.860 --> 24:55.494
(door opens)

24:55.494 --> 24:57.329
- [Jeremy] Hey,

24:57.329 --> 24:58.197
is everything all right.

24:58.197 --> 24:59.532
- [Scott] Yeah.

25:02.401 --> 25:05.071
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

25:05.071 --> 25:05.972
- You too.

25:07.073 --> 25:09.375
- Nice to meet you.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.343
Can I get you
 something to drink?

25:11.343 --> 25:12.679
- Sure, thanks.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.915
- Anything in particular?

25:15.915 --> 25:19.518
(faint whispering voices)

25:21.854 --> 25:23.723
Something the matter?

25:23.723 --> 25:26.959
(faint whispering voices)

25:26.959 --> 25:29.461
- Mineral water is pretty good.

25:29.461 --> 25:30.529
- All right.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.802
- [Jeremy] Are you okay?

25:35.802 --> 25:38.871
- [Voiceover] Don't be nervous.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.974
(slow ringing tone)

25:43.442 --> 25:45.845
- Why didn't you let
 me open the bottle?

25:45.845 --> 25:47.446
- Excuse me.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.982
- There's something
 in the water.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.250
He's trying to poison me.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.219
I won't let him.
- [Jeremy] No.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.454
(faint whispering voices)

25:55.454 --> 25:58.457
(slow ringing tone)

26:05.431 --> 26:07.066
(sinister laughter)

26:07.066 --> 26:09.802
- [Scott] Go away,
 get away from me.

26:09.802 --> 26:13.039
(indistinct dialect)

26:13.039 --> 26:15.207
(slow ringing tone)

26:15.207 --> 26:16.709
(inaudible dialect)

26:16.709 --> 26:19.111
(pulsating drum beat)

26:19.111 --> 26:20.079
I can't concentrate.
 - [Jeremy] Look at me.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.080
Look at me.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.252
- I'm here.

26:27.219 --> 26:30.422
(crying) I'm here.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.257
I'm here.

26:41.868 --> 26:43.369
(machine beeping)

26:43.369 --> 26:47.173
- [Operator] Dr. Montague,
 please call extension 13301

26:51.143 --> 26:52.645
(indistinct mumbled voice)

26:52.645 --> 26:56.348
- [Operator] Dr. Montague,
 please call extension 13301

27:02.655 --> 27:05.925
- We've given him
 medication that calmed him

27:05.925 --> 27:07.326
so he's sleeping.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.628
- Scott told me that
 his head was hurting.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.765
Do you think that he has
 some kind of brain tumor?

27:12.765 --> 27:15.201
- We'll be checking
 on all possibilities.

27:15.201 --> 27:18.137
- The young man kept
 saying he heard voices

27:18.137 --> 27:20.673
that wouldn't stop
 screaming at him.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.474
- So this is a

27:22.474 --> 27:24.576
It's a symptom of schizophrenia.

27:24.576 --> 27:27.479
- Like a nervous
 breakdown from stress?

27:27.479 --> 27:31.250
- After some tests
 we'll know more.

27:31.250 --> 27:34.153
- [Gavin] Has any of Scott's
 family been contacted?

27:34.153 --> 27:36.122
- [Doctor] We're trying
to contact his father.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.724
- [Gavin] Anyone else?

27:37.724 --> 27:41.894
- The only contact information
 we do have is for his father.

27:43.429 --> 27:46.565
I need to continue my rounds.

27:46.565 --> 27:50.536
- Do you know how to get
 a hold of Scott's mother?

27:50.536 --> 27:52.238
- No, he never wanted
 to talk about her

27:52.238 --> 27:55.307
or any of his
 family just his dad.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.944
- Well, there's
 gotta be someone.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.812
Maybe you could call one
of his friends and ask?

27:59.812 --> 28:02.314
- Gavin, leave that for later.

28:03.482 --> 28:06.352
The doctors will
 take care of him.

28:06.352 --> 28:09.121
(slow dramatic tone)

28:09.121 --> 28:12.424
- I ran into an old
 friend from college.

28:12.424 --> 28:16.796
His daughter had to be
 taken to the hospital.

28:16.796 --> 28:19.365
It was schizophrenia.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.633
- Is the girl better?

28:21.633 --> 28:25.037
- No, my friend spent
 every penny he had

28:26.072 --> 28:28.707
all kinds of hospitals.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.509
His daughter ended
 up running off.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.344
She hasn't been found.

28:34.513 --> 28:37.183
If Scott has the same thing,

28:37.183 --> 28:40.052
he'll need full-time care.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.788
Jeremy shouldn't do that.

28:41.788 --> 28:44.791
He has his whole
 life ahead of him.

28:45.624 --> 28:48.427
(rapid typing)

28:48.427 --> 28:51.663
(slow dramatic music)

28:57.403 --> 28:58.871
- Yeah,

28:58.871 --> 28:59.705
that's it.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.850
- What is going on with me?

29:10.850 --> 29:12.118
I got so much studying to do.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.921
I got to get out of here.

29:14.921 --> 29:18.124
- Scott, I need the
 truth about something.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.392
Did you ever take drugs
when I wasn't around?

29:20.392 --> 29:21.227
- No.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.030
- How about before you met me

29:24.030 --> 29:27.433
any of those years that
you lost from school?

29:27.433 --> 29:31.603
- No, maybe it's a brain
 tumor that's causing this.

29:32.905 --> 29:36.008
They can fix that can't they?

29:36.008 --> 29:36.843
- Yeah.

29:38.644 --> 29:39.478
- I'm so

29:41.347 --> 29:43.515
I'm so tired all the time.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.289
(machine beeping)

29:56.595 --> 30:00.766
- [Operator] Dr. Montague,
 please call extension 16601.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.541
- The hospital called

30:09.541 --> 30:10.709
and told me that
 my son might have

30:10.709 --> 30:13.012
some kind of mental problems.

30:13.012 --> 30:15.114
- It might be drugs
 that caused all this.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.382
- Drugs.

30:16.382 --> 30:17.917
- Scott swore that
 he never took any

30:17.917 --> 30:19.919
but if the blood
 tests show that he did

30:19.919 --> 30:21.687
then he could get better.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.923
- [Bill] Who would've
 given him drugs?

30:23.923 --> 30:25.324
- I don't know.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.393
- You know he had
 some wild friends.

30:27.393 --> 30:28.727
You hang out with them too?

30:28.727 --> 30:30.429
- Sir, I promise I

30:30.429 --> 30:31.998
- Don't sir me.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.132
Do not sir me.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.800
I'm gonna stay here.

30:52.885 --> 30:55.821
(heavy breathing)

31:13.672 --> 31:15.174
- You are correct.

31:15.174 --> 31:17.977
Taking some drugs can cause
 symptoms of schizophrenia

31:17.977 --> 31:20.179
but taking drugs
 doesn't cause it.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.448
The test were repeated
 several times.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.216
No drugs were in his blood,

31:24.216 --> 31:26.585
no signs of brain tumors.

31:26.585 --> 31:29.688
But Scott is responding
well to the medicine.

31:29.688 --> 31:32.658
It was very helpful that you
 brought him in right away.

31:32.658 --> 31:35.694
- I read online that if
 someone like Scott is not

31:35.694 --> 31:39.465
violent or suicidal that
 he can decide what to do.

31:39.465 --> 31:40.732
- Correct.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.169
- Doctor, tell my son
 how difficult it is to

31:43.169 --> 31:44.803
take care of someone
 with this condition.

31:44.803 --> 31:46.305
- I can handle it.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.608
I'll learn how

31:49.608 --> 31:51.343
do whatever it takes.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.981
(door opens)

31:56.248 --> 31:58.750
- I've been telling my
 dad that I feel fine

31:58.750 --> 32:01.787
and pretty soon
 I'll get out of here

32:01.787 --> 32:04.756
studying back to it, graduate,

32:04.756 --> 32:06.625
get a job all that.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.794
- [Bill] Yeah, no
 doubt, no doubt

32:08.794 --> 32:10.562
no doubt in my mind.

32:12.364 --> 32:14.700
- But I'm staying with Jeremy

32:14.700 --> 32:16.768
if that's what he wants.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.973
- It is.

32:20.973 --> 32:24.376
- Well, listen, maybe
 you should rest.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.845
- No, listen I'm sick
 of laying around.

32:26.845 --> 32:30.482
Look I'll make a
kick ass dinner.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.884
- My parents really
 want to meet you.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.120
- Yeah.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.888
(machine beeps)

32:51.003 --> 32:53.805
- Would you like some
 more Mrs. Driscoll?

32:53.805 --> 32:56.508
- It was very good but I'm full.

32:56.508 --> 32:59.811
- We still have some white
 wine if anybody wants some.

32:59.811 --> 33:03.015
- [Gavin] Thank you
 but we have to go.

33:03.849 --> 33:04.683
- Okay.

33:07.019 --> 33:09.988
- I can make some coffee.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.490
- Not for us son.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.059
It'll keep us awake.

33:13.059 --> 33:15.494
We have a very early flight.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.934
- I'm glad we met.

33:22.934 --> 33:23.935
- Same here.

33:25.304 --> 33:28.074
- [Rachael] I'll call
you the minute we land.

33:28.074 --> 33:29.675
- No need to worry.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.813
- [Gavin] Honey,
 we can't be late.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.515
- I'll walk your parents out.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.617
Get the coffee ready for my dad.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.152
- It'll be ready.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.487
- [Scott] Well, just give me a
 minute with your folks, okay.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.189
- [Jeremy] Okay, okay.

33:43.189 --> 33:46.458
(slow dramatic music)

33:51.163 --> 33:53.732
- Cab will be here in a minute.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.070
I hope you believe

33:58.070 --> 34:00.038
you understand that

34:00.038 --> 34:01.907
I care for him so much.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.045
Yeah.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.282
We'll be all right.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.822
- [Gavin] Honey, the
taxi's here we gotta go

34:16.822 --> 34:20.058
- [Rachael] You take
 care of yourself.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.063
- Sir, thank you.

34:28.467 --> 34:31.036
(door closes)

34:33.038 --> 34:36.275
- [Jeremy] Is
 everything all right?

34:36.275 --> 34:37.509
- [Scott] Yep.

34:39.145 --> 34:42.813
- [Bill] It's time for
 me to hit the road.

34:42.813 --> 34:44.815
I'll be back next week.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.619
- Call me whenever you get home.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.121
- [Bill] Will do.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.625
(door opens)

34:53.625 --> 34:55.092
(door closes)

34:55.092 --> 34:56.862
- Is everything okay?

34:56.862 --> 34:59.365
(bell rings)

35:01.300 --> 35:02.468
- Hey stranger

35:04.102 --> 35:06.772
hanging out in
 your favorite spot.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.440
- Yeah, I guess so.

35:17.283 --> 35:18.116
- I called

35:19.818 --> 35:21.487
couple times

35:21.487 --> 35:22.654
left messages.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.724
- I've been busy.

35:25.724 --> 35:26.558
- Me too.

35:29.428 --> 35:32.063
Heard you moved
 in with somebody.

35:32.063 --> 35:32.898
- I did.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.235
- How's that going?

35:36.235 --> 35:37.068
- Good,

35:38.136 --> 35:39.137
really good.

35:40.038 --> 35:41.540
- Glad to hear it.

35:43.575 --> 35:47.646
When I walked up you
 looked at me a certain way.

35:48.814 --> 35:52.218
- I don't know what
 you're talking about.

35:53.185 --> 35:54.520
- Think you do.

35:57.789 --> 36:01.393
- I got to finish
 reading, Elliot.

36:01.393 --> 36:02.228
- Okay.

36:05.697 --> 36:07.433
I'll see you around.

36:15.574 --> 36:16.408
- Hey.

36:18.377 --> 36:20.446
It says they just need
 to be taken exactly

36:20.446 --> 36:22.881
as the instructions say.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.317
- I'm good doing that.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.151
- Good.

36:28.053 --> 36:29.288
It's important.

36:46.772 --> 36:49.174
You been reading all night.

36:49.174 --> 36:52.077
- Got of lot of
 catching up to do.

36:54.546 --> 36:57.716
- We have a lot of
 catching up to do.

37:00.519 --> 37:04.155
- Doctor said I can't do
that for a week or two.

37:04.155 --> 37:04.990
- Why?

37:06.425 --> 37:08.960
- Mine's not working.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.362
- With the medicine.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.930
- Yeah.

37:11.930 --> 37:12.831
- Oh, okay.

37:15.734 --> 37:16.568
Okay.

37:22.207 --> 37:25.311
- But yours shouldn't
 have a problem.

37:36.187 --> 37:37.022
- Scott,

37:39.024 --> 37:39.858
oh man.

37:43.829 --> 37:46.998
(slow dramatic music)

38:22.334 --> 38:25.504
(slow dramatic music)

38:54.232 --> 38:56.535
- We're celebrating.

38:56.535 --> 38:58.470
- What's the occasion.

38:58.470 --> 39:02.173
- I checked my grades
got an A in everything.

39:03.409 --> 39:04.610
Yeah.

39:04.610 --> 39:05.744
- That's good.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.679
- Now for the surprise.

39:09.448 --> 39:12.718
All is working like it should.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.853
- No problems at all?

39:14.853 --> 39:16.555
- I did a test run.

39:17.389 --> 39:18.890
- With who?

39:18.890 --> 39:20.225
- A good friend

39:25.464 --> 39:27.365
whom I cheat on you
with from time to time.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.199
- Okay.

39:30.502 --> 39:31.336
Well,

39:32.438 --> 39:33.271
here

39:35.741 --> 39:37.375
- The wine's all yours.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.545
I don't, I don't need it.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.318
- To good friends.

39:47.318 --> 39:48.153
- Cheers.

40:08.039 --> 40:11.042
(slow somber tone)

40:15.113 --> 40:17.783
[Scott] You never gave up on me.

40:51.216 --> 40:53.652
(car alarm)

41:00.892 --> 41:03.562
(phone chimes)

41:29.487 --> 41:32.057
(phone dials)

41:33.592 --> 41:36.562
- [Scott] This is Scott leave
 a message after the beep.

41:36.562 --> 41:38.429
- Hey, Scott, it's me.

41:38.429 --> 41:40.365
Just wondering where you are.

41:40.365 --> 41:41.700
Just give me a call
 when you get this.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.035
I'll talk to you soon, bye.

41:45.537 --> 41:46.805
- You'll figure this out.

41:46.805 --> 41:48.139
You'll figure it out.

41:48.139 --> 41:49.074
You'll figure this out.

41:49.074 --> 41:51.009
You'll figure this out.

41:55.681 --> 41:57.515
This is not possible.

41:58.684 --> 42:01.519
- [Voiceover] You failed it.

42:01.519 --> 42:02.854
He's worthless.

42:04.389 --> 42:06.457
(slow ringing tone)

42:06.457 --> 42:08.960
- Quit hiding behind
 the bushes asshole.

42:08.960 --> 42:09.895
(slow ringing tone)

42:09.895 --> 42:13.398
(faint voices whispering)

42:15.400 --> 42:19.204
Whoa, all right I'm
 coming over there.

42:19.204 --> 42:22.641
(sinister laughter)

42:22.641 --> 42:26.044
(slow suspenseful tone)

42:30.682 --> 42:33.184
Wait until I grab
 you by the balls.

42:33.184 --> 42:36.521
(dismal dramatic beat)

42:56.942 --> 42:59.077
[Scott] Not gonna happen.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.078
Stop moving,

43:00.946 --> 43:02.447
stop moving,

43:02.447 --> 43:03.281
stop.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.919
(dismal dramatic beat)

43:30.041 --> 43:32.143
He'll kill him.

43:32.143 --> 43:33.745
Stop following him.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.114
Following him.

43:37.582 --> 43:38.884
Stop following me.

43:38.884 --> 43:39.885
Stop following me.

43:39.885 --> 43:41.452
Stop following me.

43:42.754 --> 43:44.756
Stop following me.

43:44.756 --> 43:47.092
Stop following me.

43:47.092 --> 43:50.328
(tense dramatic beat)

44:09.180 --> 44:10.581
- [Jeremy] What happened?

44:10.581 --> 44:13.251
- Somebody's been following me.

44:14.519 --> 44:16.554
- There's nobody out there.

44:16.554 --> 44:18.724
- He's out there, listen.

44:19.958 --> 44:21.993
- Yeah, okay, I
 think I can hear him.

44:21.993 --> 44:22.828
- Listen.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.466
- Sounds like he's walking away.

44:28.466 --> 44:29.300
- Liar.

44:31.669 --> 44:34.672
(dark malevolent laughter)

44:34.672 --> 44:36.274
- [Voiceover]
 He'll kill you run.

44:36.274 --> 44:38.143
- I won't let you poison me.

44:38.143 --> 44:40.545
(faint whispering voice)

44:40.545 --> 44:43.214
- I'll kill you you understand.

44:44.449 --> 44:48.386
(faint whispering voice)

44:48.386 --> 44:49.855
- [Operator] 911.

44:49.855 --> 44:50.856
- Yes, hello

44:51.857 --> 44:52.724
I have an

44:52.724 --> 44:54.492
I have an emergency.

45:00.899 --> 45:04.202
(slow ringing tone)

45:04.202 --> 45:07.372
(rhythmic drum beat)

45:14.612 --> 45:16.581
- Where's dad?

45:16.581 --> 45:18.583
- Back home he has to
 take care of some troubles

45:18.583 --> 45:20.351
at our store.

45:20.351 --> 45:21.186
- Is he

45:21.186 --> 45:22.754
- No, he's fine.

45:22.754 --> 45:24.255
In a couple days the
 problems will be fixed

45:24.255 --> 45:25.824
and he'll be here.

45:27.225 --> 45:29.194
- Is that what's
really going on?

45:29.194 --> 45:30.028
- Yes.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.299
I'll clean this up.

45:40.671 --> 45:43.741
Looks like you haven't
 been sleeping much.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.410
- As much as I can.

45:47.245 --> 45:50.648
- Does Scott wanna
 keep living with you.

45:52.217 --> 45:54.786
- He doesn't want me near him.

45:56.822 --> 45:58.456
He was telling everyone
that I've been putting

45:58.456 --> 46:00.125
poison in his pills.

46:01.292 --> 46:02.360
- Might be a good
 idea if you took

46:02.360 --> 46:05.496
some time off school, came home.

46:05.496 --> 46:07.232
- Yeah, I been
 thinking about that.

46:07.232 --> 46:08.066
- Good.

46:09.734 --> 46:11.202
- I've also been thinking
 about all the times that

46:11.202 --> 46:13.138
dad would get depressed.

46:13.138 --> 46:16.274
He'd just lay on
 the couch all day

46:16.274 --> 46:17.542
with that weird look on his face

46:17.542 --> 46:20.545
I just never want
 to be around him.

46:20.545 --> 46:23.815
I'm just nervous all the time.

46:23.815 --> 46:25.516
- Any five year old
would be nervous around

46:25.516 --> 46:27.085
someone like that.

46:28.553 --> 46:31.022
- When you first met dad if
 he would've gotten sick Scott

46:31.022 --> 46:34.960
do you think you
 would have left him?

46:34.960 --> 46:39.130
- There was a time he had
 been depressed for a year.

46:40.966 --> 46:43.134
We were in debt, bad debt.

46:44.069 --> 46:45.403
He couldn't work.

46:45.403 --> 46:47.973
I couldn't take it anymore.

46:47.973 --> 46:49.374
You were too little to remember.

46:49.374 --> 46:51.910
I left you with
 your grandmother.

46:51.910 --> 46:54.846
Truth is I wanted to
runaway from everything

46:54.846 --> 46:58.516
even thought your
 grandmother could raise you.

46:58.516 --> 46:59.817
I was so close to
 getting in my car

46:59.817 --> 47:01.652
and never coming back.

47:03.554 --> 47:05.656
Back then I was so busy
taking care of everybody

47:05.656 --> 47:09.094
I didn't know what I
 wanted, still don't.

47:10.161 --> 47:11.062
Maybe now I

47:12.197 --> 47:14.032
I need time to myself.

47:15.466 --> 47:17.635
- So you're leaving dad?

47:19.070 --> 47:20.071
- Not sure.

47:22.473 --> 47:25.543
- I don't know if
 I can leave Scott.

47:26.844 --> 47:30.848
- Depends on how
deeply in love you are.

47:30.848 --> 47:31.682
- Yeah.

47:38.556 --> 47:39.390
I'm tired.

47:41.359 --> 47:43.962
I don't know who I am anymore.

47:43.962 --> 47:46.231
I just, I need someone to

47:46.231 --> 47:47.698
I need you or somebody

47:47.698 --> 47:49.467
- I love you.

47:49.467 --> 47:50.936
You need no listen to me this is

47:50.936 --> 47:52.803
you need to think about where
 you are in life right now.

47:52.803 --> 47:54.005
- Look around you.

47:54.005 --> 47:56.041
Look at where what
 I'm living in.

47:56.041 --> 47:58.543
I feel like I'm going crazy

47:58.543 --> 48:00.045
and where are you?

48:00.045 --> 48:01.812
- I'm here, I'm here.

48:01.812 --> 48:04.315
- No, I have to take
 care of you now, you see.

48:04.315 --> 48:05.550
Because you come in here

48:05.550 --> 48:06.484
and you tell me
 all your problems.

48:06.484 --> 48:07.818
- Jeremy, I'm here for you.

48:07.818 --> 48:09.720
I am here for you now.

48:10.655 --> 48:12.157
- Yeah, okay.

48:12.157 --> 48:12.991
(slow somber tone)

48:12.991 --> 48:13.925
- Maybe just son you

48:13.925 --> 48:16.494
- I don't want to talk about it.

48:29.607 --> 48:31.776
(crying)

49:26.964 --> 49:29.567
(phone rings)

49:32.470 --> 49:33.471
- Hello.

49:33.471 --> 49:34.639
- [Rachael] Elliot.

49:34.639 --> 49:36.007
- Hey, Rachael, how's it going.

49:36.007 --> 49:39.077
- [Rachael] I've been better.

49:39.077 --> 49:40.411
- What's wrong.

49:41.579 --> 49:43.681
- [Rachael] He's in
 some serious trouble.

49:43.681 --> 49:44.915
- Oh.

49:44.915 --> 49:46.484
- [Rachael] I'm
 over at his place.

49:46.484 --> 49:47.685
- Is he okay?

49:47.685 --> 49:48.619
- [Rachael] No, I need you

49:48.619 --> 49:51.656
I need you to come over, okay?

49:51.656 --> 49:54.525
- Yeah, yeah I
 can be there soon.

49:54.525 --> 49:55.760
I'll head out now.

49:55.760 --> 49:57.862
- [Rachael] Okay, I
 really appreciate it.

49:57.862 --> 49:59.030
- No problem at all.

49:59.030 --> 49:59.864
- [Rachael] Thanks.

49:59.864 --> 50:01.799
- All right, bye, bye.

50:06.937 --> 50:11.409
- Make sure that anything
 sharp is locked away.

50:11.409 --> 50:12.343
- Uh, huh.

50:14.912 --> 50:17.515
(door closes)

50:22.953 --> 50:25.756
- I have to leave tonight.

50:25.756 --> 50:27.892
Your father needs me back home.

50:27.892 --> 50:31.329
The money troubles are
 worse than we thought.

50:31.329 --> 50:33.364
- Anything that I can do?

50:33.364 --> 50:35.666
- We'll handle it.

50:35.666 --> 50:40.004
I told your dad that if you
 decided to live with Scott

50:40.004 --> 50:42.006
then there's no way I'd
go back home till I knew

50:42.006 --> 50:44.242
you'd be as safe as possible.

50:44.242 --> 50:47.044
If you could let Elliot
stay here for a while

50:47.044 --> 50:48.979
I'll be able to leave.

50:50.448 --> 50:55.220
I'll get sick, sick worrying
 if you don't let Elliot stay.

50:55.220 --> 50:57.054
Talk to your father he'll

50:57.054 --> 51:00.525
He'll tell you it's
 the right thing to do.

51:02.026 --> 51:05.263
(slow melancholy tone)

51:42.200 --> 51:44.769
- If you want me to go I will.

51:46.237 --> 51:49.874
- Scott was fine before he
 stopped taking his medicine.

51:49.874 --> 51:52.977
I'll make sure that
 doesn't happen again.

51:52.977 --> 51:54.011
- After I talked to your mom

51:54.011 --> 51:56.214
I read on the internet that

51:56.214 --> 52:00.351
schizophrenia mainly happens
 to guys between 15 to 24.

52:01.152 --> 52:03.788
- Yeah, I read that too.

52:03.788 --> 52:08.359
Did you see that it
 could get you at any age?

52:08.359 --> 52:10.461
There's not even a cure.

52:12.263 --> 52:13.097
- Yeah.

52:14.499 --> 52:18.035
- They don't even know
 what causes it not really.

52:18.035 --> 52:19.804
(crying)

52:19.804 --> 52:20.738
Goddammit.

52:34.985 --> 52:35.820
- Okay.

52:35.820 --> 52:37.322
- [Jeremy] Dammit.

52:41.359 --> 52:43.661
(machine beeps)

52:43.661 --> 52:47.398
- [Jeremy] He said that his
medicine started working again?

52:47.398 --> 52:52.337
- [Bill] Right now it's better
 if he comes back with me.

52:52.337 --> 52:56.173
- [Jeremy] I can go with
 you if you want to help out.

52:56.173 --> 53:00.311
- [Bill] If you go with us
 what happens to your grades?

53:02.413 --> 53:05.383
- [Jeremy] I can take
 the classes again.

53:05.383 --> 53:08.386
- [Bill] And if it takes
 years for Scott to get better

53:08.386 --> 53:10.288
you gonna stay with us?

53:11.889 --> 53:13.157
- [Jeremy] Yes.

53:15.025 --> 53:17.995
- I'm gonna make
 this easy for you.

53:17.995 --> 53:18.829
Stay away

53:20.565 --> 53:22.800
for a little while

53:22.800 --> 53:24.869
just until he calms down.

53:26.136 --> 53:28.406
Can you do me that favor?

53:30.140 --> 53:30.975
- Yeah.

53:49.527 --> 53:52.530
(slow somber tone)

53:56.801 --> 54:00.204
Scott's dad took him
 back to their town.

54:01.772 --> 54:03.140
- For how long?

54:03.140 --> 54:04.975
- He, uh, didn't say.

54:11.015 --> 54:12.383
- I guess it's time
 for me to get my stuff

54:12.383 --> 54:14.652
out of your place.

54:14.652 --> 54:17.221
(bells ring)

54:17.221 --> 54:18.055
- If

54:21.091 --> 54:22.993
when Scott gets better

54:26.531 --> 54:29.033
I'm not sure what I wanna do.

54:32.937 --> 54:37.107
I was wondering if you could
 stay until I figure that out.

54:38.175 --> 54:39.009
- Yeah.

54:41.812 --> 54:42.647
- Good.

54:49.219 --> 54:50.388
- How is it?

54:52.022 --> 54:53.290
- It's delicious.

54:53.290 --> 54:54.792
It's my favorite.

54:56.327 --> 54:59.664
- I have another one
 of your favorites.

55:01.966 --> 55:04.301
(laughing)

55:09.507 --> 55:10.575
- Thank you.

55:31.662 --> 55:34.932
(slow tranquil music)

56:30.955 --> 56:34.124
(slow tranquil music)

57:47.297 --> 57:48.766
(applause)

57:48.766 --> 57:51.569
- [Voiceover] Graduating
class of 2015.

57:51.569 --> 57:53.604
(applause)

57:53.604 --> 57:56.874
(slow tranquil music)

58:00.545 --> 58:03.380
- [Gavin] Congratulations

58:03.380 --> 58:04.314
great job.

58:06.817 --> 58:08.553
- [Rachael] Open it.

58:13.558 --> 58:14.725
- [Elliot] Wow.

58:16.126 --> 58:17.962
- [Jeremy] It's too much.

58:17.962 --> 58:20.565
- We've had a very
 profitable year.

58:20.565 --> 58:23.834
We'll be sending a little
 extra cash each month.

58:23.834 --> 58:27.204
There'll be no starving graduate
students in this family.

58:27.204 --> 58:30.808
- [Rachael] I want a photo
 of Elliot and Jeremy.

58:30.808 --> 58:32.910
- [Gavin] Let me take it.

58:36.313 --> 58:38.082
Okay you guys ready.

58:38.082 --> 58:38.916
Nice.

58:41.686 --> 58:44.689
(slow somber tone)

59:12.249 --> 59:16.921
- [Scott] I'm too far
behind I need to study.

59:16.921 --> 59:18.488
I need to study.

59:18.488 --> 59:19.957
I need to study.

59:19.957 --> 59:21.391
I need to study.

59:21.391 --> 59:22.793
I need to study.

59:37.875 --> 59:40.210
- Scott, I made you some toast.

59:40.210 --> 59:41.445
- [Scott] Ice,

59:43.313 --> 59:44.148
ice,

59:45.315 --> 59:46.583
ice

59:46.583 --> 59:47.918
to wash it down.

59:48.986 --> 59:50.487
- [Bill] What?

59:50.487 --> 59:52.556
- [Scott] Ice to wash it down.

59:52.556 --> 59:55.125
- [Bill] Wash what down?

59:55.125 --> 59:58.629
- [Scott] There's a
 spider in my throat.

59:58.629 --> 01:00:00.330
It's in my stomach.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:03.600
(dark dramatic music)

01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:11.041
(water running)

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:22.987
(door opens)

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:27.057
(door closes)

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:45.676
(water running)

01:00:45.676 --> 01:00:49.246
(climactic dramatic tone)

01:01:22.146 --> 01:01:25.315
(inaudible dialogue)

01:01:52.877 --> 01:01:54.745
(doorbell rings)

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:55.980
- Who's that?

01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:09.994
- Come in.

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:13.363
- Hi,

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:17.101
I'm Bill.

01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:17.935
- Elliot.

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:22.706
- I need to talk to you.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:34.785
All week Scott kept
 saying over and over

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:37.387
he was going to finish school.

01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:40.057
Then he didn't say
 anything for days.

01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:41.458
I looked everywhere.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:44.694
Local police they're
 looking for him to, nothing.

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:47.264
I thought maybe, maybe
 he'd come back here

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:50.167
or someplace you guys hung out.

01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:51.601
- Did he take his medicine?

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.603
- No, he left all of it.

01:02:54.571 --> 01:02:57.507
He's out there all by himself.

01:02:57.507 --> 01:03:00.410
- I don't know if
 I can help you out.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:01.211
- Jeremy.

01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:07.084
- We'll find him.

01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:08.252
- We have to.

01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:13.323
(electronic dance beat)

01:03:32.376 --> 01:03:36.480
(indistinct faint conversations)

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:47.491
(indistinct faint conversations)

01:04:11.015 --> 01:04:14.351
- We can keep going
 I'm not that tired.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.521
- I'm almost out of gas.

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:20.157
- Well there's a
 station near here.

01:04:20.157 --> 01:04:23.260
- I think I spent about
everything I have.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.063
I got to figure out
 a long term plan.

01:04:26.063 --> 01:04:28.532
I got some land up
 north that I can sell.

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:32.702
Maybe I can hire somebody that
 finds people professionally.

01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:35.605
- Here.

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:41.912
- No,

01:04:41.912 --> 01:04:42.746
no.

01:04:49.987 --> 01:04:52.923
I'll pay you back every penny

01:04:52.923 --> 01:04:55.926
soon as I sell my
 stuff all right?

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:03.100
(engine cranks)

01:05:08.939 --> 01:05:11.708
You even think of somewhere
 he might be you call me.

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:13.443
- [Jeremy] Yeah, okay.

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:16.013
(doors close)

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:42.372
Maybe we can get the landlord to

01:05:42.372 --> 01:05:45.609
let us stay just
 a few more months.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.577
- [Elliot] We have a lot
 to do before grad school.

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:48.545
- [Jeremy] I know.

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:49.846
- A lot

01:05:49.846 --> 01:05:50.680
to do.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:51.515
- I know.

01:05:57.887 --> 01:06:00.057
- Do you still love him?

01:06:03.093 --> 01:06:03.927
- Yes.

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:58.582
- [Gavin] I would like to
 take you to dinner later on

01:06:58.582 --> 01:07:02.086
when I get home from
 work if that's okay?

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:05.522
- Maybe.

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:08.992
- Works for me.

01:07:10.327 --> 01:07:11.995
- Works for me too.

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:17.234
- Business has been
 good this month.

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:21.071
We can afford to send
him a little extra, huh?

01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:31.615
(slow somber tone)

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.216
- [Jeremy] Hey, Scott.

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:10.320
We've got your apartment all
 fixed up and ready for you.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.721
Why don't we go home.

01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:14.291
- [Voiceover] Don't
 listen to him.

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:15.725
- Let's go home.

01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:17.926
(slow ringing tone)

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:19.196
(dark whispering voice)

01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:21.665
- [Voiceover] They
 will kill you.

01:08:21.665 --> 01:08:23.933
- [Voiceover] Stab them.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.435
- No.

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:26.403
No.

01:08:26.403 --> 01:08:28.738
No.
- [Jeremy] Scott, wait.

01:08:28.738 --> 01:08:29.805
Scott, Scott.

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:32.776
(faint mumbling voices)

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:35.511
- [Jeremy] Scott, stop.

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:36.513
Scott, stop.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.515
Stop.

01:08:38.515 --> 01:08:41.917
(mumbled sinister voice)

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:51.728
(slow ringing tone)

01:08:59.002 --> 01:09:01.171
We got to get him
 away from here.

01:09:01.171 --> 01:09:02.005
- How.

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:07.676
- We have to find a way to
 force him into a hospital.

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:18.287
(sirens)

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:28.497
(indistinct conversations)

01:09:38.575 --> 01:09:40.977
(car alarm)

01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:07.203
- Scott,

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:09.673
look.

01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:10.840
- Here, Scott,

01:10:12.242 --> 01:10:13.910
this belongs to you.

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:25.555
(inaudible voice whispering)

01:10:48.645 --> 01:10:50.814
(crying)

01:10:57.186 --> 01:11:00.790
(mumbled voices whispering)

01:11:02.659 --> 01:11:05.228
- [Voiceover] You're
 worthless jump.

01:11:05.228 --> 01:11:07.531
- [Voiceover] Hey, Scott.

01:11:07.531 --> 01:11:08.998
- [Voiceover] Hey, Scott.

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:10.900
- [Voiceover]
 Scott, what's wrong.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:14.304
(voices whispering all at once)

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:16.506
- [Voiceover] Come here.

01:11:16.506 --> 01:11:19.443
- [Voiceover]
 Something the matter?

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:22.779
- [ Voiceover] What's wrong.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:26.883
(voices whispering all at once)

01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:31.555
- [Voiceover] Jump.

01:11:34.691 --> 01:11:36.360
- [Voiceover] Jump.

01:11:41.731 --> 01:11:43.567
- [Scott] No,

01:11:43.567 --> 01:11:44.401
no.

01:12:29.112 --> 01:12:32.215
(crickets chirping)

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:13.457
- You're doing much better

01:13:13.457 --> 01:13:17.026
very soon you'll
be up and about.

01:13:17.026 --> 01:13:18.361
You're improving

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:20.129
I can tell.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.333
Got to go.

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:29.906
Got to go work to do.

01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:34.944
- Scott, let her go.

01:13:37.013 --> 01:13:37.847
Let go.

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:47.924
I have something that's yours.

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:53.162
- I can't leave him
 with anything sharp.

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:56.866
- I just wanna see
 if he remembers it.

01:13:56.866 --> 01:13:58.768
It belongs to him.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:02.205
Can he just have
it for a minute?

01:14:02.205 --> 01:14:03.306
- All right.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.610
(inaudible dialogue)

01:14:42.879 --> 01:14:46.182
(slow ringing tone)

01:14:46.182 --> 01:14:49.118
(inaudible dialog)

01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:04.534
(upbeat contemporary music)

01:15:05.305 --> 01:15:11.337
