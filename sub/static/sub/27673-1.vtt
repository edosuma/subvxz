WEBVTT

00:08.925 --> 00:11.094
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.389
-Oh, shit!
-OK. It's all right, hon.

00:14.472 --> 00:16.683
That was the third time
you messed up that part.

00:16.766 --> 00:19.060
It's fine. It's fine.
It's just that's... so many.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.146
You know, I'm a bad dancer.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.314
Why do we have
to turn our wedding into a talent show?

00:23.398 --> 00:24.774
You know what? Forget it. Just forget it.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.193
-What is going on with you?
-[sighs] I'm just--

00:27.277 --> 00:29.487
-It's the engagement party.
-Oh, this again?

00:29.571 --> 00:31.573
I don't know why
I invited all those people.

00:32.115 --> 00:35.326
Ethan and Sam, and Lisa and Nick,
and Marianne.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.329
All together in the same place
for the first time since Sam's 40th.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.707
I don't know what I was thinking.
Why'd you let me do that?

00:40.790 --> 00:41.875
-Me?
-Yes!

00:41.958 --> 00:44.419
You know you treat me like a prince, hon.
You indulge my every whim.

00:44.502 --> 00:46.755
All of his straight married friends
were sleeping with each other.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.173
It was very scandalous.

00:48.256 --> 00:50.467
-Oh! Did you know?
-I did not know!

00:50.550 --> 00:54.888
Two words: epic shitshow.
People did not like it.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.890
So why would you invite them?

00:56.973 --> 00:58.892
All right. You know what, hon, I just--

00:58.975 --> 01:02.729
I don't want anyone to ruin our
engagement party with all their baggage.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.731
Most of them still
aren't even speaking to each other.

01:04.814 --> 01:06.107
It's going to be fine.

01:06.191 --> 01:09.319
They're your best friends for some reason.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.112
You're right. You're right.

01:11.196 --> 01:14.324
-They are really great people.
-Well, I didn't say that, but...

01:14.866 --> 01:16.242
they do love you.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.036
They're going to be
on their best behavior.

01:18.870 --> 01:19.788
-Guys, you ready?
-Yeah.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.247
All right, let's take it from the top.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.708

02:53.006 --> 02:54.090
-You ready?
-Yes.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.134
-Let's get this meeting going?
-Yeah, man?

02:56.217 --> 02:57.802
Let's hear
what those marketing folks have to say.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.555
I cannot wait for people
to read  Equestriana.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.849
-You still like that for the title?
-Yeah, yeah.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.392
Equestriana?

03:04.475 --> 03:06.936
You've already given us pure gold
with your story.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.438
Now we just want everybody to love it

03:08.521 --> 03:09.981
-as much as we love it.
-Yeah.

03:10.064 --> 03:16.196
Thank you so much. I'm very excited about
getting  Equestriana  out into the world.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.698
Uh, well, actually you bring up
an interesting point here.

03:18.781 --> 03:21.201
-I do?
-We're finding through our research

03:21.284 --> 03:22.493
that the title  "Equestriana"

03:22.577 --> 03:24.954
isn't quite resonating
with our teen-girl audience.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.206
Or our female audience.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.291
Okay. Wha-- What about boys?

03:28.875 --> 03:30.126
Boys don't read.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.544
-Hm-mm. No.
-No.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.339
But we've been doing some testing
and here we go.

03:34.422 --> 03:35.548
WHO READS YOUNG ADULT?

03:35.632 --> 03:37.008
BOY HORSE

03:37.091 --> 03:38.301
[Max] Stop it.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.469
Oh, my gosh.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.804
-I know. I love this one.
-That's just-- You nailed it.

03:41.888 --> 03:42.931
[chuckles] Thank you.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.807
- "Boy Horse"?
-Simple.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.976
I'm sorry, I'm the only one
that hears the problem?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.354
Boy Horse? Boy Horse...

03:49.437 --> 03:51.856
Boy Horse. I don't hear. Do you--

03:51.940 --> 03:54.359
Boy Whores, Max.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.652
-Oh.
-Oh.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.779
-That's not the books.
-We don't want that.

03:57.862 --> 03:58.988
I'm sorry, um...

03:59.072 --> 04:02.116
Why does he have the face of a child
and the body of a full-grown male?

04:02.700 --> 04:03.868
And he's got treasure trail.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.537
[woman] No, it's not a treasure trail.
That's just a horse fur.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.206
[Ethan] I'm pretty sure
those are human pubes.

04:08.289 --> 04:11.709
No, if those were pubes,
they would be on the back two legs.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.671
-Be leading to the back two legs.
-Right.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.840
-Where the d-- the penis is.
-Right.

04:17.924 --> 04:18.841
I don't know.

04:18.925 --> 04:22.929
I think, you know, the suggestion
of a pube is not the worst thing.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.514
-Not the worst thing.
-It tests very highly.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.640
We have numbers on that.

04:25.723 --> 04:26.933
-Yeah.
-You'd be surprised.

04:27.016 --> 04:28.017
-On pubic hair?
-Yeah.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.394
-Yeah.
-Absolutely.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.021
You just got to let them do what they do.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.898
All right? You're the writer,
they're the sales team.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.401
You write the book
and they'll figure out how to sell it.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.320
I-- I got the invite
to your engagement party.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.197
Yes. Yes, should be good times.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.865
Should be really fun.

04:44.909 --> 04:45.910
We invited Lisa.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.078
Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.331
-Uh... she has not RSVP'd yet.
-She doesn't respond to my emails either.

04:50.415 --> 04:53.960
So if you happen to hear from her,
ask her if we're still married.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.254
No one's heard from her.
Uh, I wouldn't take it personally.

04:56.337 --> 04:59.465
-It might be a little personal with me.
-Yeah, I can see that.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.883
-Yeah.
-Uh...

05:01.551 --> 05:02.719
Sam's coming.

05:02.802 --> 05:03.970
Mm-hmm.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.805
So, you know, she'll be there.

05:05.888 --> 05:07.807
Cool. Looking forward to hanging.

05:07.890 --> 05:11.311
So you know, just, um...
don't fuck her. [chuckles]

05:11.394 --> 05:13.521
At least not on my engagement party.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.524
Whatever, again, I think, uh...

05:16.607 --> 05:18.484
But... not at my thing.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.029
I'll call you and we'll do something soon.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.740
-I'd love to, yeah. 'Cause, bro, I am--
-[cell phone buzzing]

05:23.823 --> 05:24.949
I am open.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.243
-[chuckles] I bet.
-I'm open, you know.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.829
Hey, babe.
Oh, I got them. They look beautiful.

05:30.538 --> 05:32.457
[Max]
We should go and take a look at them.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.801
[man] Hey, man.

05:46.846 --> 05:47.972
Chili's ready.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.187
[Sam] Oh, hey!

05:54.270 --> 05:55.772
Where have you been?

05:55.855 --> 05:59.317
Oh, God. I've been training.
Just did 13 miles.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.526
Oh, what happened to your leg?

06:00.610 --> 06:01.903
Oh, right, uh...

06:01.986 --> 06:04.697
I fell so good.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.075
Uh, are you okay?
'Cause, you know, we're suppose to--

06:07.158 --> 06:08.034
[blender whirs]

06:13.331 --> 06:15.583
-What?
-We're supposed to go to Max and--

06:21.756 --> 06:23.424
No, I'm kidding.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.679
I'm sorry that we have to go
to this party and see everybody.

06:28.763 --> 06:32.725
Oh, no. That's what
all the couples' therapy is for.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.144
And at the end of the day,
it's just a few hours, right?

06:35.895 --> 06:37.313
Baby, I mean you know that--

06:37.730 --> 06:38.773
I'll try this.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.566
Mm. Mm. Mm.

06:41.109 --> 06:41.943
Mm.

06:42.026 --> 06:45.780
-Look, I just want you to know--
-Whoa! Brainfreeze! [chuckles]

06:46.489 --> 06:48.741
You know, you don't have
to come tonight, right?

06:48.825 --> 06:52.662
[chuckles] No, I ain't letting you
to go to this thing alone. Hmm-mm.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.705
[Jon chuckles]

06:58.668 --> 07:00.586
[indistinct speech over P.A.]

07:18.187 --> 07:20.565
-Excuse me, is this seat taken?
-Sit down, fucking sit down. Sit down.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.610
[Jon] I wish I had time to cool down.
I'm sweating in this jacket.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.155
You know, my leg cramps after ten miles.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.615
Um... let's-- Let's go to another part.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.118
Sweety, there's two seats.
Here, right by-- Here, together.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.077
Come on.

07:33.744 --> 07:36.122
[Jon] Come on.
You lucked out. Come on, right here.

07:36.205 --> 07:39.625
-Look at this. Sweet!
-[Sam] Okay. [sighs]

07:40.084 --> 07:41.002
Yeah.

07:42.044 --> 07:43.212
[indistinct chatter]

07:45.047 --> 07:45.882
Why--

07:45.965 --> 07:47.383
Oh, my God!

07:47.467 --> 07:49.260
We're all on the same train!

07:49.343 --> 07:50.887
What are the chances?

07:50.970 --> 07:52.054
[Sam] What? Oh... [chuckles]

07:53.014 --> 07:55.975
-Hi, everyone.
-Oh, my gosh. I didn't see you guys there.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.394
-I didn't see any of you.
-Hi, everyone.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.396
-That's--
-Hi!

08:00.480 --> 08:02.064
Oh, excuse me, sir.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.774
Would you mind changing seats with me?

08:03.858 --> 08:06.152
-No.
-It's okay, not necessary.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.905
Yeah, I don't wanna inconvenience
anybody, Marianne, so it's fine.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.615
-I'd be happy to move.
-Stay the fuck down.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.493
-Don't you fucking go.
-[Marianne] Ah!

08:13.576 --> 08:15.578
-Come on, Nick.
-Okay.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.497
-I'm so...
-Okay.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.414
Good!

08:18.498 --> 08:22.752
-Hi!
-Hi. Hi. It's fun. It's fun.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.545
[Marianne] Ah!

08:24.629 --> 08:26.172
[indistinct speech over P.A.]

08:30.426 --> 08:32.470
Marianne, do you have
any plays  coming up, or--

08:33.012 --> 08:33.930
[Marianne] Um...

08:34.013 --> 08:36.641
Have you guys heard of Shakespeare
in the Park? [clicks tongue]

08:36.724 --> 08:38.142
-Yeah.
-Oh, wow!

08:38.226 --> 08:39.477
Wow, that's great!

08:39.810 --> 08:42.355
-I'm gonna audition.
-Good luck.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.274
-Ah! Ow!
-Are you okay? Are you okay?

08:45.358 --> 08:46.567
Out, get out!

08:47.652 --> 08:50.196
I mean, my leg is cramping. God damn it.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.490
I got it. No big deal.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.617
Marathon, running a marathon. Okay.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.785
I'll walk it out.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.872
My God.
I haven't seen you in, like, forever.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.166
-Yeah.
-Have you been living under a rock?

09:02.792 --> 09:04.794
I've been, you know, lying low.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.381
Got a weird roommate, finished my book.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.675
It's, uh... It's about centaurs.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.135
Oh, okay. Is that the half-bull thing?

09:13.219 --> 09:15.346
That's a minotaur.
That's a common mistake.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.807
-Yeah, centaurs are half man, half goat.
-Oh, no, that's a satyr.

09:17.890 --> 09:21.018
-Half man, half goat is a faun.
-I think that fawn is a baby deer.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.478
Oh, babies...

09:22.562 --> 09:25.982
That's fawn, F-A-W-N,
I'm talking faun, F-A-U-N.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.234
I briefly majored in folk and myth,
remember?

09:28.317 --> 09:30.444
-Oh.
-Forgot you were a goth weirdo.

09:30.528 --> 09:31.821
Uh-- [mumbles]

09:32.363 --> 09:34.407
So, what's your book called?

09:35.658 --> 09:39.370
The working title is...  Boy Horse.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.834
Well, you know, write what you know.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.294
[all laugh]

09:46.377 --> 09:48.004
Come back! Come back.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.422
[clears throat]

09:50.339 --> 09:51.299
[Jon sighs]

09:55.011 --> 09:56.178
Have you talked to Lisa?

09:59.390 --> 10:02.393
-Have you talked to Lisa?
-No, I haven't. I haven't.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.478
Have you talked to Lisa?

10:04.562 --> 10:05.521
-No.
-Oh, my God.

10:07.231 --> 10:10.192
-I haven't talked to her either.
-Jesus fucking Christ.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.242
Oh, my gosh!

10:18.326 --> 10:19.994
-Hey!
-Oh, my God, this is so nice.

10:20.077 --> 10:22.163
-That is so nice,
-Did you guys come here all together?

10:22.788 --> 10:25.541
That is the best present ever!

10:25.625 --> 10:27.043
Hey, Nick!

10:27.126 --> 10:28.377
Hey, buddy.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.962
Oh, hi! [chuckles]

10:30.046 --> 10:32.006
-Good to see you, too.
-How are you?

10:32.089 --> 10:33.007
Hi.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.925
Max was afraid you
were all gonna to cause a scene

10:35.009 --> 10:38.054
and I told him that wouldn't happen
under any circumstances.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.181
Code of silence, Felix. Code of silence.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.349
-Oh.
-That's right.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.894
-Hey, is Fun Eithan gonna be here tonight?
-No, he's dead and buried.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.980
Do you have a cooler
where I could store my broccoli water?

10:48.064 --> 10:49.815
I'm on a very strict diet.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.277
Jon, your pant is all bloody.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.988
Oh, yeah, I'm training for a marathon.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.948
I tripped over a boy on my run.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.617
Oh, my God, you didn't tell me that.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.244
-Is the boy okay?
-Well, I don't tell you everything either.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.373
And, yeah, I think so. [laughs]

11:06.707 --> 11:10.044
All right, well, why don't we go try to
find a room where we can put your...

11:10.628 --> 11:12.838
special jar, okay?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.215
-Okay.
-Yes!

11:14.298 --> 11:16.634
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

11:16.717 --> 11:17.718
[Jon] Sounds good.

11:19.553 --> 11:22.515
Whoa! Oh, my God, is that Merrill Morgan?

11:22.598 --> 11:23.724
What's she doing here?

11:23.808 --> 11:25.559
I'm representing
her new lifestyle tell-all.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.103
-Really?
-What she ever done

11:27.186 --> 11:28.938
that requires her to write a tell-all?

11:29.021 --> 11:34.318
Uh, she just got divorced from that
drug-addicted Rockefeller or Carnegie.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.946
Not sure. Also has recipes.
It's gonna sell like hot cakes.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.823
-Good.
-Oh, my God, is Nick in it?

11:38.906 --> 11:41.992
Uh... I don't know.
Max, is there a chapter on best lays?

11:42.076 --> 11:45.246
No, the book
does not go back to the late 90's.

11:45.329 --> 11:46.789
[laughs]

11:46.872 --> 11:50.334
Why does she always calls you Ames?
Is that like a WASP thing?

11:50.418 --> 11:53.379
-Uh, yeah. Do you feel excluded?
-Yeah, I do.

11:53.462 --> 11:54.630
Well, then it's working.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.465
-Congratulations, Max.
-Miss Morgan.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.050
Beautiful party.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.220
I feel so fortunate to be a part
of your big moment.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.263
[Max] Of course!

12:02.763 --> 12:03.597
Ames?

12:04.557 --> 12:07.226
-Haven't seen you in such a long time.
-Hey, Gorgeous.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.103
You look amazing.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.188
Oh. It's like a full-time job
when you reach my age.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.732
[all laugh]

12:15.192 --> 12:16.610
I'm Merrill Morgan.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.864
I'm Sam. We were in class together.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.867
Oh. Sorry, of course. Now I remember.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.827
-Uh, Merrill Morgan.
-Oh, Ethan Turner.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.329
-We were also in class together.
-Excellent.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.291
This is like a little reunion.
What a blast!

12:30.833 --> 12:32.918
-Merrill Morgan.
-No, thank you.

12:33.502 --> 12:34.420
What?

12:41.010 --> 12:43.888
Wow, she can carry that, huh?

12:43.971 --> 12:46.432
[Marianne] Okay, I can tell you
as  a professional performer,

12:46.515 --> 12:48.350
she's overdoing the face stuff.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.061
Yeah, but if she brings
that much passion to her violin,

12:51.145 --> 12:52.313
think how much passion

12:52.396 --> 12:54.440
-she'd bring to my bow.
-Ew.

12:54.523 --> 12:55.483
[chuckles]

12:56.525 --> 12:57.485
[Jon] Wow.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.278
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

12:59.361 --> 13:00.738
Oh, my God. It's Lisa.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.990
-I thought you said she didn't RSVP.
-She didn't. I swear.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.450
I'm just as surprised as you are.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.828
-She's with someone.
-I see that. We can all see this.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.413
-They're walking towards us.
-I know.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.540
Okay, stop narrating.
None of us are blind.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.417
Hey, everyone!

13:13.501 --> 13:15.002
-Hi.
-Hi!

13:15.085 --> 13:16.670
Hello, handsome.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.547
-Oh, Maxie.
-Lisa!

13:19.131 --> 13:21.091
You look so fantastic, so trim!

13:21.175 --> 13:23.260
-Thank you.
-I am so happy for you guys.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.720
Congratulations!

13:25.304 --> 13:27.681
Marianne, I love your hair!

13:27.765 --> 13:29.558
-Oh, thanks.
-Oh, Nick, buddy!

13:29.850 --> 13:31.602
I'd recognize you anywhere. [chuckles]

13:31.936 --> 13:33.854
And Sam you are here.

13:34.939 --> 13:35.856
-Hi.
-Hi!

13:35.940 --> 13:37.525
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hi, Ethan!

13:37.608 --> 13:38.859
Ethan, this is Charlie.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.486
-Charlie, this is Ethan.
-Pleasure.

13:40.569 --> 13:43.280
Hi, nice to mate you. Nice to meet you.
Nice to mate you?

13:43.364 --> 13:46.283
-This is-- Charlie's my new fella.
-Hi, everyone.

13:46.867 --> 13:49.203
It's really nice
to put some names to faces.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.747
So, uh... Charlie, what do  you do, bro?

13:51.831 --> 13:53.374
I'm a lawyer, too.

13:53.457 --> 13:54.792
Habeas corpus,
you know what I'm saying, bro?

13:54.875 --> 13:56.669
-Sorr-- What?
-Hmm?

13:58.003 --> 13:59.630
Um, how did you two meet?

13:59.713 --> 14:00.798
Oh. [laughs]

14:01.465 --> 14:03.551
It's a really funny story. So, um...

14:03.634 --> 14:08.514
we used to work together
and we both worked on the same floor.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.269
So...

14:14.186 --> 14:15.688
That is so funny.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.189
Well--

14:18.190 --> 14:20.317
It was fantastic. Yeah.

14:20.401 --> 14:24.321
Ladies and gentlemen,
the suckling pig is now ready. Follow me.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.656
-[chuckles]
-[Felix] Follow me.

14:25.739 --> 14:29.827
Um, Ethan, I'm getting the vibe
that this thing could explode.

14:29.910 --> 14:34.373
So I just want everyone to remember
that this is my engagement party

14:34.456 --> 14:36.625
and I would be so, so sad.

14:37.084 --> 14:37.918
Okay?

14:38.002 --> 14:39.628
Okay. Fantastic.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.754
She is saying that a lot.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.965
-She is, yes, but it's your day.
-So many times.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.843
It's gonna be fine. It's your day.
Let's take a deep breath and enjoy.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.762
We just kept walking... [laughs]

14:48.846 --> 14:51.015
I haven't seen her in so long

14:51.098 --> 14:54.059
and I want to talk to her,
but I'm so nervous.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.562
Oh, you should talk to her.
You guys were such good friends.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.731
This is the perfect place to make amends.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.275
Right.

15:02.860 --> 15:03.944
Do it.

15:06.780 --> 15:07.907
I go to go get her ginger ale,

15:07.990 --> 15:10.451
-and then you came back and went to--
-[Marianne] Lisa, hi.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.077
So great to see you.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.746
I've really missed you.

15:13.829 --> 15:17.583
Oh! Uh, Marianne, this is Charlie.
Charlie, this is Marianne.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.293
Yeah, we just met inside.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.420
Yeah. She was my best friend.

15:21.503 --> 15:24.173
And then I found out she knew
about the whole thing all along,

15:24.256 --> 15:26.884
but she never got around
to mentioning it to me. [chuckles]

15:26.967 --> 15:29.887
-Maybe it slipped your mind.
-Hello again. [chuckles]

15:29.970 --> 15:34.350
Well, um, I was stuck in the middle,
and I didn't know what to do.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.894
And I love both you and Sam.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.855
And I know what I did was wrong, but...

15:40.481 --> 15:41.857
it wasn't the worst thing.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.651
Oh, right. It was not the worst thing.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.236
You were not the worst person
in the whole thing.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.073
Oh, that must be
such a weight off your shoulders.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.074
Eesh.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.785
Hey, um...

15:53.577 --> 15:55.579
It's great-- great to see you.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.206
Bye. Bye.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.211
Oh, uh...

16:02.795 --> 16:04.797
Your, uh, boys are watching us.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.006
-[Lisa] Oh, yeah?
-[Charles] Yeah.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.258
-Oh, one's coming.
-Which one?

16:08.342 --> 16:09.635
Bald one.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.762
Don't leave me under
any circumstances, okay?

16:12.346 --> 16:14.014
-Hey, Lisa. Uh...
-Hey!

16:14.098 --> 16:16.892
Can, uh... Can I just grab
a couple minutes to talk to you?

16:17.351 --> 16:18.227
Mm-hmm.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.023
-Would you...
-Oh, I'm sorry, man.

16:23.107 --> 16:26.860
I would love to leave, as you can imagine,
but she asked me not to.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.070
-So...
-Yeah.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.155
Okay, I see.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.073
What's going on?

16:31.156 --> 16:34.576
Well, you haven't responded
to my emails or texts or...

16:35.119 --> 16:36.787
phone calls or letters.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.831
-Letters?
-Which is your prerogative.

16:38.914 --> 16:42.209
-Correct.
-Uh... okay, well, um...

16:42.876 --> 16:44.211
We have to split up our things.

16:44.294 --> 16:47.464
We have to figure out our finances
and we have to figure out

16:47.548 --> 16:51.635
if and when we are doing
something official about our marriage

16:51.719 --> 16:53.679
or, more likely, lack thereof.

16:53.762 --> 16:56.598
And, um, you think
that Max's engagement party

16:56.682 --> 16:58.767
is the place   that we should
be talking about this?

16:58.851 --> 17:02.229
Okay, well,
I'm just looking for a time to--

17:03.105 --> 17:04.940
I'm just looking for a time to meet.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.862
-And it can be brief.
-Well, sure.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.071
-Great.
-Great.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.156
Great.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.450
So I'll give you a call then.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.953
You will answer. [chuckles]

17:18.037 --> 17:18.871
Okay.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.006
So have you heard from Bonnie?

17:29.089 --> 17:33.093
Yes, she and Ted are still Stonington.
Do you keep up with Suzi?

17:33.177 --> 17:35.220
She and Walker got divorced
a couple years ago,

17:35.304 --> 17:37.514
but Pru made the America's Cup team.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.684
Mm. Oh, that's fantastic.
TZ must be over the moon.

17:40.768 --> 17:41.977
-Yeah.
-How's Tilly?

17:42.061 --> 17:44.271
Uh, Divorced Coop, married Francis.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.314
She's a lesbian now?

17:45.397 --> 17:48.150
-No, Van Nostrand, not Von Kohorn.
-[laughs]

17:48.233 --> 17:49.943
[laughs] Oh, my God!

17:50.569 --> 17:52.488
I was about to say.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.989
-Can you Imagine?
-No!

17:54.073 --> 17:55.991
The two of them
at the yacht club on the Vineyard?

17:56.116 --> 17:57.826
-That would have gone over well.
-Poor thing would've died!

17:59.244 --> 18:01.163
It's not even possible.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.915
I want to thank you all for coming

18:02.998 --> 18:04.833
and for making the trip out from the city.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.087
I can't tell you
how much it warms our hearts

18:08.170 --> 18:10.964
to see all of you,
our oldest friends, here...

18:11.590 --> 18:12.758
celebrating together...

18:13.258 --> 18:15.719
side by side, arm in arm...

18:16.512 --> 18:19.932
as you always have and you always will.

18:20.015 --> 18:21.850
And I just want to give a shout-out

18:21.934 --> 18:25.771
to all my boys from the John's Hopkins
Department of Obstetrics,

18:25.854 --> 18:28.816
the bad boys of the baby ward. Ooh, ooh!

18:28.899 --> 18:30.651
[all] Ooh, ooh!

18:30.734 --> 18:33.403
Oh, also, my mom wants to say something.

18:33.487 --> 18:37.574
So if you could all give a warm welcome
to my mother, Martha Adler.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.535
-Yeah!
-[applause]

18:39.618 --> 18:41.537
-Hey!
-[man] Yeah!

18:41.620 --> 18:44.164
You know, when Max
first blew it with Felix,

18:44.248 --> 18:45.374
I was so mad at him.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.836
But thank God, he had the good sense
to beg him to take him back.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.380
-[laughter]
-It didn't happen exactly like that, Mom.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.756
Yes, it did.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.091
[Martha] Yes, it did.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.010
Maybe it did. Maybe it did.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.221
Hopefully, they don't cheat on each other.

19:01.098 --> 19:01.932
Uh-huh.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.185
You know, it does happen,   and...

19:05.269 --> 19:07.437
it's pretty hard to come back
from when it does.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.858
Especially when you got kids...
[chuckles] Oh!

19:10.941 --> 19:11.859
[whispers] Stop it.

19:12.776 --> 19:13.610
[Jon] Sure.

19:17.656 --> 19:18.782
Thank you.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.284
[indistinct chatter]

19:21.618 --> 19:22.536
Thanks.

19:31.795 --> 19:34.548
WHERE TO?
HOME

19:38.802 --> 19:39.928
[sighs]

19:51.899 --> 19:53.192
[Sam] Come on.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.115
Sam?

20:01.700 --> 20:02.534
Sam?

20:03.452 --> 20:04.453
Sam!

20:17.674 --> 20:21.136
-[Nick] By "bow" I mean dick--
-Have you guys seen Sam?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.471
I-- I can't find her.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.973
-Uh... no.
-No.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.434
-Sam!
-Sam!

20:27.517 --> 20:28.477
Sam!

20:30.270 --> 20:31.271
Sam!

20:31.355 --> 20:32.773
-[Nick] Sam!
-[Marianne] Sam!

20:35.567 --> 20:38.195
-Well, I guess we should split up.
-Yeah, all right.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.113
Ethan and I'll go this way,
you go that way?

20:40.197 --> 20:42.074
I'm not going to go alone.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.493
That's what I said.
You and I will go together.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.245
-All right.
-And you go that way.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.581
[Marianne] Sam!

20:50.165 --> 20:51.083
[Ethan] Sam!

20:58.382 --> 20:59.675
Oh, no.

21:00.926 --> 21:01.927
Oh, no.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.054
Oh, no.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.516
-Sam!
-Shh, shh, shh.

21:09.142 --> 21:10.686
What's happening? Are you all right?

21:12.854 --> 21:15.357
[mouthing] There is a skunk.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.402
I can't-- There's a skunk!
There's a skunk!

21:18.485 --> 21:19.987
-There's a skunk! Sam, watch out!
-[Sam screaming]

21:20.070 --> 21:21.738
Skunk! Skunk, Sam!

21:21.822 --> 21:23.699
Oh, my God! There's a skunk!

21:24.199 --> 21:26.076
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

21:26.159 --> 21:27.828
Oh. Oh.

21:28.203 --> 21:31.039
Oh, what is wrong with you?

21:31.123 --> 21:32.916
It was starting to walk away!

21:33.000 --> 21:34.501
I was... ugh...

21:34.584 --> 21:37.004
quietly handling this situation.

21:37.087 --> 21:39.089
I just saw the skunk
and I didn't know if you saw the skunk

21:39.172 --> 21:40.799
and I was like, "Skunk!" And then it--

21:40.882 --> 21:42.801
You're right! You handled it perfectly!

21:42.884 --> 21:44.261
-I'm so sorry.
-Oh, jeez.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.471
Listen, I'm sorry about everything
is what I'm saying.

21:47.431 --> 21:51.143
I-- I didn't picture it like this,
but I just owe you an apology, okay?

21:51.226 --> 21:54.479
I know you didn't want me to tell Lisa,
but I was making her crazy.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.815
I had to.
I just had to tell her, Sam, okay?

21:56.898 --> 21:59.609
We're doing it now? Are you kidding me?

21:59.693 --> 22:02.529
Look. Look, it was for the best, OK?

22:02.612 --> 22:07.242
It forced me to tell John, I mean,
we both made this mess, it's just--

22:07.326 --> 22:08.243
Pfft.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.455
I mean, it sucks that it's always
the woman that gets the stink.

22:11.538 --> 22:12.414
Oh, God, I'm--

22:14.583 --> 22:15.709
It's good to see you again.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.461
[sighs]

22:17.544 --> 22:19.838
You too.
I think it's going really well so far.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.256
[laughs, coughs]

22:21.340 --> 22:23.425
Oh, God. Please don't make me
breathe out of my nose.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.302
Sam, are you all right?

22:25.385 --> 22:26.428
-Oh, Jesus!
-Oh!

22:26.511 --> 22:27.763
Whoa!

22:27.846 --> 22:30.349
Oh, my God. Did you get sprayed by skunk?

22:30.807 --> 22:33.852
Oh, my God. You two
are never getting that stink off you.

22:33.935 --> 22:36.563
-Don't we know it.
-I have a change of clothes if that helps.

22:37.272 --> 22:38.440
Oh, jeez.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.650
[all gagging]

22:40.734 --> 22:41.860
[softly] Ew.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.489
-Ew.
-Is that the way you puke?

22:45.572 --> 22:48.116
-Ew.
-Oh, why are you so adorable?

22:55.957 --> 22:59.378
-[Marianne] I'm so sorry.
-Honestly, apologizing makes it worse.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.380
Oh, my God. You fucking reek.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.173
My eyes are burning.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.177
-Hey!
-Hey.

23:08.512 --> 23:09.471
Making your getaway?

23:10.680 --> 23:11.765
Change of clothes for Sam.

23:11.848 --> 23:13.183
Ah.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.726
I swear I didn't hire the skunk.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.187
Sure. But it still deserves
a tip, though, right?

23:17.270 --> 23:19.481
-Oh, a big one. [chuckles]
-Yeah.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.109
So, how has your year been?

23:22.192 --> 23:24.694
Good. New boyfriend seems kind of random.

23:25.695 --> 23:26.530
Thank you.

23:27.989 --> 23:33.120
It's actually kind of nice dating someone
outside the blast radius of all this.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.830
Yeah, been there.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.832
Yeah. Charlie is really nice.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.918
Yeah, yeah. No, he seems like  a  guy.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.922
How's Merrill Morgan?

23:45.132 --> 23:48.343
Thinking about taking a dip
in the family gene pool again?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.720
I mean, maybe. I might.
She gave me her number.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.764
-Oh.
-It was very sexy.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.809
Plus, your ancestors
were on a Mayflower together.

23:55.892 --> 23:57.894
Mm... I don't know about that.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.646
That's a little more my speed.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.774
-[Lisa chuckles] Really?
-Mm-hmm.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.192
You haven't outgrown that yet?

24:04.276 --> 24:06.236
I mean, if she's that passionate
about her violin,

24:06.319 --> 24:08.613
think about how passionate
she'd be with my bow.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.824
How many times
have you done that bit today?

24:10.907 --> 24:12.075
Three and a half thousand.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.660
-[chuckles]
-If it ain't broke...

24:16.288 --> 24:17.914
Hey, Marianne.

24:18.957 --> 24:19.791
Uh...

24:21.168 --> 24:22.461
It's safe.

24:22.919 --> 24:24.129
[stammers]

24:24.212 --> 24:25.547
I'm so sorry and...

24:26.381 --> 24:28.049
I just missed you so much.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.301
[sighs]

24:29.384 --> 24:30.594
Yeah, I missed you, too.

24:33.096 --> 24:34.181
Aw.

24:36.516 --> 24:39.352
-Now watch and learn.
-[Lisa] Okay.

24:41.354 --> 24:44.024
-Oh, the violinist?
-Yeah. [sighs]

24:46.776 --> 24:48.987
How does that still work?

24:49.446 --> 24:52.491
You gotta be very--
You gotta be very gentle with it.

24:54.075 --> 24:54.951
Wow.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.204
-Gonna take off.
-[Felix] Thank you.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.788
-Lovely to see you.
-You too.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.957
-Congratulations.
-I'm so glad you came!

25:01.041 --> 25:03.210
-Waiting for the big day.
-All the best, you guys.

25:03.293 --> 25:04.920
I'll see you soon. Bye.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.963
-It was a pleasure.
-Thank you.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.049
-I'll see you at the wedding.
-Yes. I love gay weddings.

25:09.132 --> 25:10.091
It's gonna be fun.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.259
It's just a wedding.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.553
-Bye.
-Regular wedding.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.722
All right, Max, I'm heading out, buddy.

25:15.805 --> 25:18.016
-I'm so glad you came.
-I'm so glad you did this.

25:18.099 --> 25:19.935
-Felix.
-Ethan. Thank you.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.688
-I'm so happy for you guys!
-I'm so glad you came!

25:23.772 --> 25:25.273
-Thank you.
-Oh, my gosh.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.442
-You are just so tall.
-Yes. [chuckles]

25:27.526 --> 25:30.028
So, how much did all of this cost?

25:30.904 --> 25:32.405
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Dudes!

25:32.489 --> 25:33.740
-Hey!
-[Nick] Dudes!

25:33.823 --> 25:35.492
Aw!

25:35.575 --> 25:37.536
-Congrats! Love you guys.
-Love you, man.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.579
-So happy for you.
-So glad you came. Thank you.

25:39.663 --> 25:40.789
-I'll see you at the wedding.
-For sure.

25:40.872 --> 25:41.873
Okay, good.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.833
-You ready?
-Yeah.

25:44.417 --> 25:46.878
-Bye!
-We made it.

25:46.962 --> 25:47.837
[sighs]

25:47.921 --> 25:49.339
-Okay. We did it!
-We did it.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.049
-It wasn't so terrible.
-No.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.677
-You were great, hon.
-Thanks, you too.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.720
-I love you.
-I love you, babe.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.267
Why would someone ask
how much this thing cost?

26:00.350 --> 26:02.310
That's like the most fucked-up question.

26:02.852 --> 26:03.937
[scoffs]

26:04.020 --> 26:05.105
They're terrible.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.190
[sighs]

26:08.733 --> 26:09.734
Agh.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.070
[groans]

26:12.153 --> 26:14.197
Pee-ew. Agh.

26:14.656 --> 26:15.740
Agh.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.995
Okay, listen...

26:20.996 --> 26:23.206
It is one thing to punish me...

26:23.832 --> 26:27.419
but you have started to punish people
who aren't even involved.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.170
Oh.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.506
-So now it's all my fault?
-No.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.507
Mm.

26:33.466 --> 26:36.219
We've been working on this
for a year and...

26:37.137 --> 26:39.014
and you still seem...

26:39.097 --> 26:40.557
very angry.

26:41.224 --> 26:43.018
Of course I am.

26:43.810 --> 26:48.064
Uh, what would you expect
after you make me come to this party?

26:48.148 --> 26:50.317
I told you that you didn't have to come.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.985
Maybe I shouldn't have.

26:53.361 --> 26:55.614
After seeing Ethan...

26:56.990 --> 26:59.784
and all those other clowns,
I don't know if I can do this.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.247
What-- What are you saying?

27:07.834 --> 27:10.337
I don't think
I'm ever gonna get over this.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.840
And I think we should get a divorce.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.565
I can-- Excuse me.

27:45.455 --> 27:47.624
[woman] Oh, agh.

27:47.707 --> 27:49.376
