15:07.699 --> 15:10.284
Uh, it's, it's Kelly.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.745
Kelly Johnson.

15:11.786 --> 15:12.975
Dude, where are you?

15:12.976 --> 15:14.163
We're starting.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.165
'Sup?

15:16.207 --> 15:17.751
Well, I should go.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.481
But it was nice to meet you,

15:19.482 --> 15:21.170
Kelly. Kelly Johnson.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.443
It's, it's nice

15:22.444 --> 15:23.673
to meet you, too.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.551
Scotty, Scotty...

15:26.593 --> 15:29.554
I... don't know your last name.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.489
[chuckles]

15:53.327 --> 15:56.247
Hey, you're the new girl.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.498
- You know that's
- the wrong uniform

15:57.540 --> 15:58.708
for this time of year, right?

15:58.750 --> 16:00.543
Yup, I've heard.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.048
I'm Nicola,

16:05.049 --> 16:06.257
but everyone calls me Nic.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.801
Hi, I'm Kelly.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.677
Wait. Say that again.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.764
What? I-I'm Kelly.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.578
You're American!

16:14.579 --> 16:16.350
Oh, I love your accent!

16:16.392 --> 16:17.435
-Say more things.

16:17.436 --> 16:18.478
-What?

16:18.519 --> 16:19.687
Oh, just say more things,

16:19.688 --> 16:20.855
so I can hear you talk.

16:20.897 --> 16:23.107
Uh... apple pie?

16:23.149 --> 16:24.692
-Uh... blizzard...

16:24.693 --> 16:26.235
-Oh...

16:26.277 --> 16:29.405
Pillow fight, banana...

16:29.447 --> 16:30.719
-You're funny!

16:30.720 --> 16:31.991
-Thanks.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.076
- -Um, this is my first day here.
- -Oh, really?

16:34.118 --> 16:35.516
Well, well, where are you from?

16:35.517 --> 16:36.913
Why are you here?

16:36.955 --> 16:38.122
- Well, how long have you
- been here?

16:38.164 --> 16:39.332
Why, why at the gymnastics...

16:39.373 --> 16:40.834
Do you do gymnastics?

16:40.875 --> 16:42.502
- -Uh...
- -Oh, it's so exciting.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.378
- -I'm from Atlanta.
- -Mm-hmm.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.547
[Kelly]

16:45.548 --> 16:46.673
Uh, I'm here with my mom

16:44.420 --> 16:46.673
for a year.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.675
- She's a surgeon
- at the City Hospital.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.510
I, I do...

16:50.551 --> 16:52.637
Well, I-I did gymnastics.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.909
Oh, well, um,

16:53.910 --> 16:55.139
if you don't do gymnastics

16:55.181 --> 16:57.433
then... why be here?

16:57.475 --> 16:59.123
Um, I'm just sorta used to

16:59.124 --> 17:00.770
being in a gymnasium.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.146
Kinda feels like home.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.293
I don't really have

17:03.294 --> 17:04.397
any friends, so...

17:04.440 --> 17:06.567
Well, now you do.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.386
So if you've done

17:12.387 --> 17:13.992
lots of gymnastics before

17:14.032 --> 17:15.305
maybe you could help me out

17:15.306 --> 17:16.577
a bit then, yeah?

17:16.618 --> 17:18.496
- -Help you out?
- -Yeah.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.873
I wanna get good enough

17:19.874 --> 17:21.207
to make the elite squad.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.938
Well, you looked pretty good

17:22.939 --> 17:24.627
on the trampoline. I mean...

17:24.669 --> 17:26.296
Yeah, well,

17:26.297 --> 17:27.922
until I fell on my face.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.737
Well, my dad

17:29.738 --> 17:31.509
is a gymnastics coach

17:31.551 --> 17:33.302
- so I might be able
- to help a little bit.

17:33.344 --> 17:34.846
Really, a coach?

17:34.888 --> 17:36.264
Yeah, but let's not

17:36.265 --> 17:37.640
get into that right now.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.517
Okay. Sure.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.023
[pop music playing]

17:45.105 --> 17:47.107
Okay, spread your arms.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.115
Like that? Is it better?

17:55.157 --> 17:56.743
[indistinct chatter]

17:57.368 --> 17:59.913
Okay. Ow! Ow!

18:03.290 --> 18:05.919
[indistinct chatter]

18:22.142 --> 18:23.269
Have a great day.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.647
Oh, my... That's great.

18:26.689 --> 18:29.108
Anyway, um, so what's the deal

18:29.149 --> 18:30.276
- with the other girls
- on the team?

18:30.317 --> 18:32.194
I think I met... Jess.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.780
- -Jess?
- -Yeah.

18:33.821 --> 18:34.864
Jess is basically a jerk.

18:34.865 --> 18:35.907
You know what I mean?

18:35.949 --> 18:37.951
- Jess is on a sports scholarship
- to Floruit.

18:37.992 --> 18:39.306
She's a year older than us,

18:39.307 --> 18:40.620
finishes school this year

18:40.661 --> 18:42.038
and easily one of

18:42.039 --> 18:43.414
the best gymnasts around here

18:43.456 --> 18:44.937
and sort of the...

18:44.938 --> 18:46.417
queen of her year.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.419
- She lives just with her mother
- and grandmother

18:48.461 --> 18:49.837
like, this tiny,

18:49.838 --> 18:51.213
little place up north.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.340
- Actually, I think everybody's
- a bit scared of her.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.508
I mean, I am.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.677
She's very motivated

18:56.719 --> 18:57.783
to win a US gymnastics

18:57.784 --> 18:58.846
scholarship

18:58.888 --> 19:00.265
'cause I think it's her only

19:00.266 --> 19:01.641
chance to go to university.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.643
- She won't be able
- to afford to go here.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.144
'Cause you're from the US, you

19:05.145 --> 19:06.604
two might have a lot in common.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.731
Not my first impression.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.108
Uh, I don't think she liked me

19:10.149 --> 19:12.318
- within the first five seconds
- of meeting me.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.986
Yeah, she can be pretty scary

19:13.987 --> 19:15.613
when she wants to be...

19:15.655 --> 19:17.073
which is always.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.908
- She works part-time
- at a fish and chips shop

19:18.950 --> 19:20.451
- and I went there once
- with my parents.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.682
My dad made me ask her

19:21.683 --> 19:22.870
for some vinegar.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.205
It was so weird.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.415
Oh, and she has a bit of history

19:26.457 --> 19:27.834
- with one of the guy gymnasts,
- Scotty.

19:27.875 --> 19:28.939
You perhaps saw him

19:28.940 --> 19:30.003
training at the gym.

19:30.044 --> 19:31.337
Then there's Ashley.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.005
She envies Jess,

19:33.006 --> 19:34.632
like, huge, like...

19:34.674 --> 19:36.926
And is Jess' right-hand girl.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.761
They've been friends for years,

19:38.762 --> 19:40.554
but, really, they're frenemies.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.848
Like, Ashley's a good gymnast

19:41.889 --> 19:43.161
but she just doesn't have

19:43.162 --> 19:44.433
Jess' talent

19:44.475 --> 19:46.060
- so she can't quite get
- to be the head girl

19:46.102 --> 19:47.541
so she has to settle

19:47.542 --> 19:48.980
for the next best.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.149
There's a bit of jealousy there.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.026
I think I know what that's like.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.173
Sam is an ex-rhythmic gymnast.

19:55.174 --> 19:57.279
Um, stuck with it for years.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.073
- She never really quite got
- the rhythmic stuff.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.700
She just kept dropping the ball,

20:00.701 --> 20:02.284
and getting tangled and...

20:02.326 --> 20:03.619
Dropping the ball

20:03.620 --> 20:04.912
and getting tangled?

20:04.954 --> 20:06.246
Yeah, literally.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.748
Like, great lines,

20:07.749 --> 20:09.208
flexible, strong

20:09.249 --> 20:11.627
but she couldn't quite grasp

20:11.669 --> 20:13.546
the extra co-ordination needed.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.464
- Her coach said
- she should try artistic.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.257
- Sam's easy-going,
- like, always be nice

20:17.299 --> 20:19.531
but she's in Jess' elite

20:19.532 --> 20:21.762
little group nowadays and...

20:21.804 --> 20:22.972
Oddly enough, she's turned into

20:23.014 --> 20:24.036
a really good netballer,

20:24.037 --> 20:25.058
as well.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.225
Netball? What's that?

20:26.266 --> 20:27.685
Oh, it's a way big hit.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.520
It's like basketball

20:29.562 --> 20:32.148
but you don't run with the ball.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.774
Then what do you do with it?

20:33.816 --> 20:35.568
Score goals, of course!

20:35.609 --> 20:36.798
I'll take you to a game

20:36.799 --> 20:37.987
at some stage.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.697
Then there's the boys.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.491
Justin, really good gymnast

20:42.533 --> 20:43.868
doesn't attend Floruit.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.703
- He was in an elite program,
- but quit.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.372
He likes performing and singing.

20:47.373 --> 20:48.998
He's pretty good, too.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.771
He juggles doing gym,

20:50.772 --> 20:52.501
singing and acting lessons

20:52.543 --> 20:54.379
and I think he might even be

20:54.380 --> 20:56.214
part of a band. Not sure.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.132
I call him Biebs.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.446
-Why?

20:59.447 --> 21:00.718
-Biebs.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.553
Justin.

21:04.055 --> 21:05.306
-Beiber.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.557
-Oh, right.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.975
Makes sense. Got it.

21:08.017 --> 21:11.311
Uh, what about the other guy?

21:11.353 --> 21:13.189
Uh... Oh, Scotty.

21:13.231 --> 21:14.399
Plays heaps of sports.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.566
He's a Floruit.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.713
Um, he's a little bit

21:16.714 --> 21:17.818
shy for me.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.299
Rich parents, too,

21:19.300 --> 21:20.738
but he's a really nice guy.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.823
- Jess and Scotty
- had a thing going for a while.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.158
- -What?
- -Mm.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.244
- [Nicola]
- Yeah, they broke up last year.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.683
But I reckon she's still

21:27.684 --> 21:29.080
sort of keen on him though.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.269
But he doesn't like her

21:30.270 --> 21:31.415
anymore, right?

21:34.877 --> 21:36.378
I'm just asking so that I know

21:36.420 --> 21:37.588
the lay of the land

21:37.589 --> 21:38.756
and everything.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.467
You did hear what I said

21:40.468 --> 21:42.135
about Jess, yeah?

21:42.176 --> 21:43.177
And for the record,

21:43.178 --> 21:44.178
she broke it off.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.617
She didn't want

21:45.618 --> 21:47.014
any distractions.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.683
Then there's Luke. He's cool.

21:48.684 --> 21:50.309
Doesn't attend Floruit.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.061
Um, Luke's brothers and sisters

21:52.062 --> 21:53.771
have all been in gymnastics.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.398
His sister

21:55.399 --> 21:56.983
was an awesome gymnast

21:57.024 --> 21:58.567
- but she's overseas,
- studying now...

22:02.404 --> 22:04.240
- [Nicola]
- Kelly?

22:04.282 --> 22:06.117
- -Hello?
- -Hi.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.431
-Yeah, sorry. Here.

22:07.432 --> 22:08.702
-Oh, my God.

22:08.744 --> 22:09.871
Uh, hey, so what's,

22:09.872 --> 22:10.997
what's your story?

22:11.038 --> 22:12.102
-What are you all about?

22:12.103 --> 22:13.166
-Oh. Best part, you see

22:13.207 --> 22:14.917
- I was a trampolinist,
- but I wanted a change.

22:14.959 --> 22:15.981
See, I always wanted

22:15.982 --> 22:17.003
to do artistic gymnastics

22:17.044 --> 22:18.671
- but because
- I've come into it late

22:18.712 --> 22:20.965
- I don't really have the control
- like the others.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.424
- That's why
- I'm in the seconds gym

22:22.466 --> 22:23.864
trying to get

22:23.865 --> 22:25.261
as much training as I can.

22:25.303 --> 22:26.929
- Well, that's what
- Jess told me to do.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.118
She keeps describing me as,

22:28.119 --> 22:29.265
like, out of control

22:29.307 --> 22:31.725
- which, I mean, I just don't get,
- like, what does she mean?

22:32.601 --> 22:33.727
Hm.

22:34.352 --> 22:35.855
I can't imagine.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.065
Hm.

23:24.611 --> 23:27.114
Hey, Kel. So how was your day?

23:27.156 --> 23:28.574
You mean, besides wearing

23:28.575 --> 23:29.992
the wrong uniform all day?

23:30.034 --> 23:31.535
Was it that bad?

23:34.038 --> 23:35.873
- [sighs]
- No.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.106
I'm sorry.

23:40.107 --> 23:41.670
There's just some posts online.

23:41.712 --> 23:42.734
Do you want me to beat up

23:42.735 --> 23:43.756
somebody for you?

23:43.797 --> 23:45.779
It depends. How quickly can you

23:45.780 --> 23:47.760
get to Atlanta and back?

23:54.432 --> 23:55.601
Hey, you have that photo

23:55.602 --> 23:56.769
from back home on there.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.688
It's a nice shot.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.401
- You used to have
- that other picture

24:03.441 --> 24:04.860
- with your father
- coaching you at the gym

24:04.902 --> 24:07.487
as your background.

24:07.529 --> 24:08.948
- Always used to make me
- feel a bit jealous

24:08.989 --> 24:10.866
when I saw that picture.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.201
Really?

24:14.995 --> 24:16.997
Yeah. I, I deleted that.

24:17.039 --> 24:18.207
Not happy memories

24:18.208 --> 24:19.375
at the moment.

24:20.918 --> 24:22.502
Listen, Kel.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.509
I know this trial separation

24:28.510 --> 24:30.136
is hard on you...

24:30.177 --> 24:31.616
but coming here is

24:31.617 --> 24:33.055
a circuit breaker for all of us.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.933
We needed it.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.395
Yeah, I know.

24:39.437 --> 24:40.896
I get it.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.856
- Maybe you wanna
- go back with your dad.

24:42.898 --> 24:46.026
Mom, no.

24:46.068 --> 24:47.799
I wanna be here with you.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.529
Really.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.035
I made a friend today.

24:55.077 --> 24:56.745
Nic.

24:56.787 --> 24:58.581
She's, she's really great.

24:58.582 --> 25:00.374
She's funny. You'll like her.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.189
That's great, honey. I knew

25:02.190 --> 25:03.961
you would make friends quick.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.715
I, uh...

25:08.757 --> 25:11.344
met Nic at the gym.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.370
I-I told her I would

25:17.371 --> 25:18.684
help her out with gymnastics.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.063
Define help out.

25:26.733 --> 25:30.612
Well, I think I sorta told her

25:30.654 --> 25:32.573
that I had done

25:32.574 --> 25:34.492
a little bit of gymnastics

25:34.532 --> 25:36.555
and I might have mentioned that

25:36.556 --> 25:38.578
my dad was a gymnastics coach.

25:38.620 --> 25:42.082
So I told her I could...

25:42.124 --> 25:43.647
probably help her out

25:43.648 --> 25:45.169
a little bit.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.586
Right.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.840
Wait one second.

25:57.764 --> 26:00.393
My championship leotard?

26:00.434 --> 26:01.539
I thought you might be

26:01.540 --> 26:02.644
needing it again.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.440
Thanks, Mom.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.700
Okay, what is going on?

26:16.742 --> 26:18.035
Every time you jump up, you have

26:18.036 --> 26:19.328
a different arm movement.

26:19.370 --> 26:20.829
I just go with the flow.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.873
- You know, I wanna
- add to the move, you know?

26:22.915 --> 26:23.958
I don't wanna be stuck

26:23.959 --> 26:25.000
with a rod up my back.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.919
I wanna be free.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.379
Women's artistic gymnastics.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.798
Free?

26:31.840 --> 26:33.342
I mean, this whole sport

26:33.343 --> 26:34.843
is about precision.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.658
Doing the same move,

26:36.659 --> 26:38.431
the same way, the right way

26:38.472 --> 26:40.328
every single time.

26:40.329 --> 26:42.184
You've gotta get serious.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.602
You seem serious enough

26:43.603 --> 26:44.978
for the both of us

26:45.020 --> 26:46.604
and the rest of Floruit.

26:46.646 --> 26:48.606
- -I have to work on that.
- -Okay.

26:48.648 --> 26:49.983
How about you just watch me

26:49.984 --> 26:51.318
for one second?

26:51.360 --> 26:52.570
- -Okay?
- -Okay. Yeah.

26:52.610 --> 26:53.862
Alright.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.326
-Just do exactly what I do.

26:59.327 --> 27:00.953
-Yeah.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.455
- [Kelly]
- Okay.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.501
Wow, you are good!

27:07.543 --> 27:09.044
- Alright, now at the end
- of your move

27:09.086 --> 27:10.796
try finishing it off nicely.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.506
Present yourself.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.050
-Oh!

27:15.051 --> 27:16.093
-Oh! I am so sorry.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.512
- Well, I should've been watching
- for spinning students.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.098
So, do you gym?

27:21.140 --> 27:23.559
Uh, yeah, I, I do.

27:23.601 --> 27:25.144
-I mean, I, I used to.

27:25.145 --> 27:26.686
-Her dad's a coach.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.606
- Well, I might see you
- on the floor then.

27:28.646 --> 27:30.107
Or maybe you won't see her

27:30.149 --> 27:31.525
- and she will
- knock you down again.

27:31.567 --> 27:32.860
-Thanks, Nic.

27:32.861 --> 27:34.153
-Shh, don't distract me.

27:34.194 --> 27:35.695
I'm practicing.

- a little mini comp

28:27.581 --> 28:28.937
against the boys,

28:28.938 --> 28:30.292
and Jess isn't at training.

28:30.334 --> 28:31.335
So how about joining?

28:31.377 --> 28:32.670
- -Where's Jess?
- -Oh.

28:32.710 --> 28:35.381
Family or work stuff, I think.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.590
- -Sounds fun?
- -Yeah.

28:36.632 --> 28:38.384
Let's go.

28:38.425 --> 28:41.220
No, not you, just Kelly.

28:42.596 --> 28:43.972
What?

28:44.014 --> 28:46.725
We need one extra. Just you.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.101
- I don't think so.
- I think I'll pass.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.646
No, no, no. You go, Kelly.

28:50.688 --> 28:51.980
Yeah, you show them.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.753
I mean, you really show them.

28:53.754 --> 28:55.484
Let's go.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.407
Go, Ash.

29:42.239 --> 29:44.742
Whoo! Go, Kelly!

30:00.173 --> 30:01.759
[all cheering]

30:01.800 --> 30:03.636
Go, Kelly! Oh, my God!

30:03.677 --> 30:06.388
You're amazing! You go, girl.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.515
Okay.

30:08.557 --> 30:10.142
And the scores are

30:10.183 --> 30:13.103
girls, 72.5

30:13.145 --> 30:14.355
thanks to Kelly's 14

30:14.356 --> 30:15.564
on her buzz.

30:15.606 --> 30:16.920
Pretty good for someone

30:16.921 --> 30:18.233
not competing, I might add.

30:18.275 --> 30:20.569
Boys, 76.

30:20.611 --> 30:21.841
-Yeah!

30:21.842 --> 30:23.071
-Come on!

30:32.247 --> 30:33.999
Super impressive, Kelly.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.084
- I'd like to have you
- on the team. You interested?

30:36.126 --> 30:37.440
Thank you, I really

30:37.441 --> 30:38.754
appreciate the offer

30:38.796 --> 30:40.381
but I'm not looking

30:40.382 --> 30:41.965
to compete right now.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.175
Are you sure?

30:43.176 --> 30:44.343
Y-you have so much talent.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.969
I'm sure.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.389
Nic is really desperate

30:49.431 --> 30:51.141
to join the team, though.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.205
I mean, she would benefit

30:52.206 --> 30:53.226
from the better training

30:53.268 --> 30:55.103
- and working
- with the other girls.

30:55.145 --> 30:57.189
Well, Nic has improved a lot

30:57.230 --> 30:58.816
- but I don't think
- she's quite ready

30:58.898 --> 31:00.693
for a competition just yet.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.006
Besides, Jess doesn't

31:02.007 --> 31:03.278
want her in the team.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.780
Jess? What does she have--

31:04.822 --> 31:06.219
-Hey, great moves on the bar.

31:06.220 --> 31:07.616
-Thank you.

31:07.658 --> 31:09.535
- I'm a little bit
- out of practice, though.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.244
If that's your out of practice,

31:11.245 --> 31:12.912
I'd like to see you in practice.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.832
- Come on, man.
- Is that your best line?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.750
- Luke, you got
- that brown paper bag?

31:16.792 --> 31:18.168
Might need it.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.295
I keep forgetting

31:19.296 --> 31:20.379
I need to get new friends.

31:20.420 --> 31:21.838
-I like your accent.

31:21.839 --> 31:23.256
-It's Canadian, yeah?

31:23.298 --> 31:26.009
No, the mighty US of A.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.303
-Thank you very much.

31:27.304 --> 31:28.554
-Told you, didn't I?

31:28.595 --> 31:30.139
Ah, US. I love the US.

31:30.140 --> 31:31.682
What part of States you from?

31:31.724 --> 31:33.517
- -Georgia.
- -Hm.

32:08.552 --> 32:09.969
- -Hey, Mom?
- -Mm-hmm?

32:10.011 --> 32:12.180
Do you remember Megan

32:12.181 --> 32:14.349
from the US team?

32:14.391 --> 32:16.039
-[Sarah]
That girl who laughed that time

32:16.091 --> 32:17.686
the uneven bars collapsed.

32:17.728 --> 32:19.354
Yup, I remember.

32:19.396 --> 32:22.357
She was a tough competitor.

32:22.399 --> 32:24.234
Never got the feeling she was

32:24.235 --> 32:26.069
much of a friend, though.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.821
-Why?

32:27.822 --> 32:29.531
-It doesn't matter.

32:29.573 --> 32:33.493
What about Sophie and Elorie?

32:33.535 --> 32:35.412
- [Sarah]
- They were great gymnasts.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.248
Really nice girls.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.833
I thought they were friends,

32:39.834 --> 32:41.376
as well, aren't they?

32:41.418 --> 32:43.002
I always liked them.

32:44.797 --> 32:45.798
[Kelly]

32:45.799 --> 32:46.799
Yeah, me too.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.219
Not so sure.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.266
Mel just messaged.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.851
We are officially entered

32:57.893 --> 32:59.686
- into the National Teams comp
- in Melbourne!

32:59.728 --> 33:01.104
[cheering]

33:01.146 --> 33:02.627
You know, I sort of miss

33:02.628 --> 33:04.107
the high of competing.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.818
Yeah. I'd just like

33:05.819 --> 33:07.486
to try it once and find out.

33:07.527 --> 33:08.862
- [Kelly]
- Yeah.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.113
So, um...

33:10.155 --> 33:12.115
- how are you gonna
- pay for the trip?

33:12.157 --> 33:13.533
- Well, that's why
- I've been working

33:13.575 --> 33:15.118
and missing a few sessions.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.621
I was not gonna miss this.

33:17.663 --> 33:20.165
[pop music playing]

33:59.997 --> 34:03.082
[indistinct chatter]

34:08.922 --> 34:10.590
Kelly. Did you hear?

34:10.632 --> 34:12.592
- We're going
- to the team Nationals.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.636
Oh, yeah. Congratulations.

34:14.637 --> 34:16.638
You guys must be really excited.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.244
Well, you know how these

34:18.245 --> 34:19.808
teams events work, right?

34:19.850 --> 34:21.310
With only the top three scores

34:21.311 --> 34:22.768
counted on each apparatus

34:22.811 --> 34:24.103
it would really help

34:24.105 --> 34:25.397
to have a fourth team member

34:25.438 --> 34:27.440
to help drop our lower scores.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.942
I'd really like you

34:28.943 --> 34:30.402
on the team, Kelly.

34:30.443 --> 34:32.529
Look, I, I really

34:32.530 --> 34:34.614
appreciate the offer

34:34.656 --> 34:36.241
but I'm just not looking

34:36.242 --> 34:37.826
to compete right now.

34:37.868 --> 34:39.369
- But if you need
- an extra team member

34:39.411 --> 34:41.163
I don't see why Nic

34:41.164 --> 34:42.915
can't join the team, right?

34:42.956 --> 34:44.875
Nic is just not up to it.

34:44.917 --> 34:46.333
W-what do you mean?

34:46.376 --> 34:48.837
Have you even seen her lately?

34:48.879 --> 34:50.380
Uh, she's improved

34:50.382 --> 34:51.882
by leaps and bounds

34:51.924 --> 34:53.154
like... literal

34:53.155 --> 34:54.384
leaps and bounds.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.697
No, I've not really

34:55.699 --> 34:56.969
seen her lately

34:57.012 --> 34:58.514
but Jess says she's not really

34:58.515 --> 35:00.015
up to a National Team comp.

35:00.057 --> 35:01.704
We need to strengthen the team,

35:01.705 --> 35:03.351
not add a weak member.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.812
Nic has been working so hard.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.251
I think with just

35:07.252 --> 35:08.648
a little bit of extra training

35:08.690 --> 35:10.316
- she could really get
- to that next level--

35:10.358 --> 35:12.256
Listen, if you change your mind,

35:12.257 --> 35:14.153
please let me know.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.655
You really shouldn't let

35:15.656 --> 35:17.115
a talent like yours go to waste.

35:21.244 --> 35:22.537
- [Kelly]
- I just don't get this control

35:22.579 --> 35:24.081
- that Jess has over
- the rest of the team

35:24.122 --> 35:25.457
and Coach Mel.

35:25.498 --> 35:26.812
You literally can't hurt

35:26.813 --> 35:28.126
the team's scores

35:28.167 --> 35:29.544
- and they're still
- not letting you in.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.337
- I'm just not good enough
- for the team yet.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.881
- I mean, I get it
- from Mel's side

35:32.923 --> 35:35.050
- because it's a really big deal
- here to have coached

35:35.092 --> 35:37.176
- the girl who gets
- the US gymnastics scholarship.

35:37.218 --> 35:38.949
So she's not gonna get

35:38.950 --> 35:40.680
Jess offside.

35:40.722 --> 35:43.016
Don't stress about it so much!

35:43.058 --> 35:44.309
- You need to learn
- to relax a little.

35:44.350 --> 35:46.895
Hm.

35:48.898 --> 35:50.857
I'd take you to a netball game?

Alright.

38:01.238 --> 38:02.822

38:04.242 --> 38:05.617
to get Kelly to join us.

Like really good.

She'd be good for the team.

some competition.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.217
I reckon you ask her, Jess

Hm. Megan.

42:27.067 --> 42:28.463
thought she knew it all.

42:28.505 --> 42:30.215
So she moved to another state

42:30.256 --> 42:31.800
and... now she hates

42:31.801 --> 42:33.343

And then a bunch

42:34.470 --> 42:35.553
of stuff happened

42:35.594 --> 42:37.596
and then I moved to Australia

42:37.638 --> 42:39.161

- in the Invitational

-Save it, Jess.

We're not interested.

44:00.430 --> 44:02.307
- Do you wanna
- go to Nationals or not?

Together, the team will have

44:14.528 --> 44:16.362
a better chance of doing well...

44:16.404 --> 44:18.615
but the only thing is

44:18.656 --> 44:20.408
Nic is in too if I join.

44:20.450 --> 44:21.701
-Wait, what?

44:21.702 --> 44:22.952
-Still not interested.

44:22.994 --> 44:24.183
What makes you think

44:24.184 --> 44:25.371
we can do better with you?

44:25.413 --> 44:27.019
Jess, Kelly could score

44:27.020 --> 44:28.625
really well.

44:28.666 --> 44:29.855
It could get us

44:29.856 --> 44:31.043
to the top of the club teams.

44:33.171 --> 44:34.380
How does that help me?

44:34.422 --> 44:35.652
Look, I'm not interested

44:35.653 --> 44:36.882
in a scholarship

44:36.924 --> 44:38.321
but the team going to top ten

44:38.322 --> 44:39.718
or even top five

44:39.760 --> 44:42.430
will get attention for you.

44:42.472 --> 44:43.869
I've been competing in big comps

44:43.870 --> 44:45.266
since I learned how to walk.

44:46.767 --> 44:49.061
The girls say you're the best.

44:49.103 --> 44:50.709
So we'll have a one-on-one

44:50.710 --> 44:52.315
apparatus comp.

44:52.357 --> 44:54.526
You and me.

44:54.567 --> 44:57.028
Any apparatus you choose.

44:57.069 --> 44:58.821
If I win...

44:58.863 --> 45:01.032
Nic and I are in.

45:01.073 --> 45:03.993
And if we lose... we're out.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.432
Go on, Jess. Nothing to lose.

45:05.433 --> 45:06.829
You'll smash her.

45:06.871 --> 45:08.414
What? No way!

45:08.456 --> 45:12.544
Kelly is... in real trouble.

45:12.585 --> 45:14.295
- Are you sure
- you wanna do this, Kelly?

45:14.337 --> 45:15.588
Yes.

45:18.508 --> 45:20.092
Alright.

45:20.134 --> 45:21.553
You're on!

45:22.178 --> 45:23.846

45:23.888 --> 45:25.056
But if I win

45:25.097 --> 45:26.349
and I decide

45:26.350 --> 45:27.600
you're good enough...

45:27.642 --> 45:29.165
you join the team...

45:29.166 --> 45:30.687
without Nic.

45:46.327 --> 45:48.162
Yes, come on, Jess. Let's go!

45:48.204 --> 45:49.706
Smash it out, Jess.

46:10.893 --> 46:12.729
Kip to the high bar

46:12.769 --> 46:14.813
cast a handstand

46:14.855 --> 46:17.609
giant, giant dismount.

46:49.307 --> 46:52.226
Kelly is doing Jess' routine...

46:52.268 --> 46:54.061
except it's perfect.

47:03.862 --> 47:05.197
Ooh, my God!

47:05.239 --> 47:07.325
Kelly, that was really amazing!

47:11.496 --> 47:12.871
What?

47:19.211 --> 47:20.879
- [Mel]
- Okay, Jess

47:20.921 --> 47:23.048
excellent score as per usual

47:23.090 --> 47:25.259
37.5...

47:26.260 --> 47:28.721
But, Kelly, 43.

47:28.763 --> 47:29.888
- Kelly and Nic,
- you're on the team!

47:29.930 --> 47:33.100
Oh, my God! Yay!

47:45.822 --> 47:47.532
Wow!

47:47.573 --> 47:48.658
Hate to admit it,

47:48.659 --> 47:49.742
but impressive, Kelly.

48:21.399 --> 48:22.880
No way are you doing that

48:22.881 --> 48:24.360
to me, girl.

48:30.032 --> 48:31.950
Well, what have you been up to?

48:31.992 --> 48:33.223
Just working with Mel

48:33.224 --> 48:34.453
before and after practice.

48:34.495 --> 48:36.539
- Haven't trained
- in a while, gotta catch up.

48:36.581 --> 48:37.978
Catch up to who? You're

48:37.979 --> 48:39.375
the best girl on the team.

49:17.663 --> 49:18.664
-Ten more seconds, girls.

49:18.665 --> 49:19.665
-Let's go thirty.

49:19.707 --> 49:20.957
- -What?
- -What?

49:20.999 --> 49:22.167
I'm dying here.

49:22.209 --> 49:23.628
You wanted to be here.

49:25.003 --> 49:27.214
Ah, it burns!

49:28.549 --> 49:30.217
- [Mel]
- Okay, relax.

49:31.552 --> 49:33.429
- Thirty seconds relax
- and we go again?

49:33.471 --> 49:35.389
What's with the whip, Kelly?

49:35.431 --> 49:36.724
No pain, no gain.

49:36.766 --> 49:38.101
No, seriously,

49:38.102 --> 49:39.435
you're smashing us, mate.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.270
It's all I know.

49:41.271 --> 49:43.063
Either all in or not at all.

49:43.105 --> 49:44.106
[Nicola]

49:44.107 --> 49:45.107
Where did that come from?

49:45.149 --> 49:47.067
- [Kelly]
- My dad, I guess.

49:47.109 --> 49:49.153
- It's either
- total commitment or nothing.

49:49.194 --> 49:50.655
Let's go again?

49:52.448 --> 49:53.658
- [Mel]
- Okay.

49:53.699 --> 49:55.367
Ready...

49:55.409 --> 49:56.661
and go.

50:03.041 --> 50:05.127
- Nic, what is with the arms?
- We talked about this.

50:05.169 --> 50:06.629
Yeah, well,

50:06.630 --> 50:08.088
I just wanna be free.

50:08.130 --> 50:09.465
Show some of my own style.

50:09.507 --> 50:11.634
This is not freestyle dance

50:11.676 --> 50:12.927
this is a major competition!

50:12.969 --> 50:14.658
-Focus!

50:14.659 --> 50:16.347
-Girls, you are too serious.

50:16.388 --> 50:17.556
- [Nicola]
- Relax.

50:20.184 --> 50:21.644
Start the music!

50:22.895 --> 50:25.982
[pop music playing]

50:40.705 --> 50:42.144
Look at her.

50:42.145 --> 50:43.582
She's gonna drag us all down.

50:57.179 --> 50:58.430
Never been to Melbourne

50:58.472 --> 51:00.307
but I think

51:00.308 --> 51:02.142
my luggage went there.

51:02.184 --> 51:03.936
That's about as close I've got

51:03.937 --> 51:05.688
to visiting so far, but...

51:05.730 --> 51:08.106
- -What's it like?
- -Oh, much bigger than Adelaide.

51:08.148 --> 51:10.026
- -Um, there's this--
- -How about we just focus

51:10.066 --> 51:12.737
on winning comps, okay?

51:12.778 --> 51:13.800
Some of us actually

51:13.801 --> 51:14.822
want to do well.

51:14.864 --> 51:16.615
- So maybe you could focus
- on the competitions

51:16.657 --> 51:17.867
and not on everything else.

51:17.909 --> 51:19.535
Chill, Jess.

51:19.577 --> 51:21.391
We all wanna do well. We're all

51:21.392 --> 51:23.205
focused and working hard.

51:23.247 --> 51:24.895
I hope so. Because there's no

51:24.896 --> 51:26.542
way I'm letting any dead weight

51:26.584 --> 51:28.669
anchor us down in competitions.

51:28.711 --> 51:30.796
You know what I mean?

51:35.927 --> 51:37.574
Um, has she read

51:37.575 --> 51:39.221
what I'm thinking she's read?

51:39.263 --> 51:40.827
Their pages are public.

51:40.828 --> 51:42.391
You read them, remember?

51:42.433 --> 51:44.393
- Well, who cares?
- She's just being mean.

51:44.435 --> 51:46.102
- Look, don't let her
- get you down, Kel.

51:46.144 --> 51:47.646
- You're the best gymnast
- I've ever seen.

51:47.688 --> 51:49.044
-You're gonna do great!

51:49.045 --> 51:50.399
-We both are.

51:54.695 --> 51:56.405
- You know, you might
- be disappointed

51:56.447 --> 51:57.823
in your new best friend

51:57.824 --> 51:59.199
once competition starts.

51:59.241 --> 52:00.284
She's not all

52:00.285 --> 52:01.326
she's cracked up to be.

52:01.368 --> 52:03.788
Kelly? She's not my best friend.

52:05.330 --> 52:07.041
Wait, what do you mean?

52:07.083 --> 52:08.480
Just remember

52:08.481 --> 52:09.877
you heard it here first.

52:09.919 --> 52:11.191
We'll see when comps start

52:11.192 --> 52:12.463
who has what it takes.

52:18.469 --> 52:20.596
- [Nicola]
- Hey, Ash, you forgot to mention

52:20.638 --> 52:22.932
- it's either raining
- or about to rain in Melbourne

52:22.974 --> 52:24.725
all the time.

52:24.767 --> 52:26.310
- Expecting to see
- Bella and Edward.

52:28.104 --> 52:30.314
- Do you wanna see how many chips
- I can fit in my mouth?

52:31.732 --> 52:33.442
No, not really.

52:33.484 --> 52:34.506
[Scotty]

52:34.507 --> 52:35.527
Good, it's actually

52:33.484 --> 52:35.527
not that many.

52:35.569 --> 52:37.613
I would've embarrassed myself.

52:39.197 --> 52:41.283
Now you should be embarrassed.

52:41.325 --> 52:43.035
You made me.

52:44.078 --> 52:45.412
- -Well...
- -I'll be back.

52:45.454 --> 52:46.622
Come back when

52:46.623 --> 52:47.790
you learn some manners.

52:47.832 --> 52:50.126
Oh, gross...

52:50.876 --> 52:52.003
Yeah.

52:55.339 --> 52:56.757
Look.

52:56.799 --> 52:57.905
You've managed to worm

52:57.906 --> 52:59.010
your way on to the team

52:59.051 --> 53:00.177
and bring your weirdo

53:00.178 --> 53:01.303
little friend along, too.

53:01.345 --> 53:02.638
But guess what, I've been doing

53:02.639 --> 53:03.931
a bit of reading about you.

53:03.973 --> 53:05.808
Yeah, I've noticed.

53:05.850 --> 53:07.748
You're a lot of things, Jess,

53:07.749 --> 53:09.645
but subtle isn't one of them.

53:09.687 --> 53:11.022
It's true, isn't it?

53:11.063 --> 53:12.419
You lose it

53:12.420 --> 53:13.774
when it comes to competitions?

53:13.816 --> 53:15.464
Okay, you don't know anything

53:15.465 --> 53:17.111
about what happened.

53:17.153 --> 53:18.946
That stuff you saw online

53:18.947 --> 53:20.739
was just some jealous girl!

53:20.781 --> 53:22.491
Not the first one.

53:23.826 --> 53:25.786
And apparently, not the last.

53:25.828 --> 53:26.850
I don't care what you do

53:26.851 --> 53:27.872
on your own time, Kelly

53:27.913 --> 53:29.331
but you had better not tank this

53:29.332 --> 53:30.749
competition, not this time.

53:30.791 --> 53:32.793
-Jess, it's just a sport!

53:32.794 --> 53:34.795
-No, it's not!

53:34.837 --> 53:36.338
It might be just a sport to you

53:36.380 --> 53:37.506
but I've been working

53:37.507 --> 53:38.632
my whole life

53:38.674 --> 53:40.759
for an opportunity like this.

53:40.801 --> 53:42.803
I haven't had everything

53:42.804 --> 53:44.805
handed to me by my daddy.

53:44.847 --> 53:46.140
I've earned this.

53:46.182 --> 53:49.351
Don't you dare mess it up.

53:49.393 --> 53:50.686
I haven't had anything

53:50.687 --> 53:51.979
handed to me--

53:52.021 --> 53:53.438
Oh, Kelly, I really don't care.

53:53.480 --> 53:54.877
I just don't want my future

53:54.878 --> 53:56.274
being dragged down

53:56.316 --> 53:57.735
by another dead weight

53:57.736 --> 53:59.153
anchor performance by you.

53:59.195 --> 54:00.738
You've got it?

54:11.040 --> 54:12.541
[sniffles]

54:14.250 --> 54:15.794
Hey, Kel...

54:20.424 --> 54:22.509
She-she was with Jess.

54:30.059 --> 54:32.686
What did you say to her?

54:32.728 --> 54:34.646
Just some home truths.

54:34.688 --> 54:36.023
What are you thinking?

54:36.065 --> 54:37.337
We start our comps

54:37.338 --> 54:38.609
tomorrow, Jess.

54:38.650 --> 54:40.235
It's a team competition,

54:40.236 --> 54:41.820
it's not just all about you.

54:41.862 --> 54:44.364
The team does bad, you do bad.

54:44.406 --> 54:46.408
Just get over yourself!

54:52.288 --> 54:53.624
Hey!

54:53.665 --> 54:56.043
What happened back there?

54:56.085 --> 54:57.461
Nothing.

55:01.465 --> 55:02.758
I just...

55:03.759 --> 55:06.137
What if Jess is right?

55:06.178 --> 55:08.680
Right about what?

55:08.722 --> 55:10.057
This is my first competition

55:10.058 --> 55:11.391
on my own

55:11.433 --> 55:13.518
without my dad.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.937
- This is my chance
- to show everyone

55:14.979 --> 55:16.521
- that I'm good enough
- to make it on my own

55:16.563 --> 55:18.149
- without any sort
- of special treatment

55:18.190 --> 55:20.567
but what if I'm not?

55:20.609 --> 55:21.652
What if I just

55:21.653 --> 55:22.694
drag the team down?

55:22.736 --> 55:24.446
What are you talking about?

55:24.488 --> 55:26.157
- You're the best gymnast
- on the team.

55:26.198 --> 55:27.449
- You're just
- saying that because--

55:27.491 --> 55:29.868
Because it's true!

55:29.910 --> 55:31.808
But it doesn't matter

55:31.809 --> 55:33.705
how much I believe in you

55:33.747 --> 55:35.707
you gotta believe in yourself.

55:38.294 --> 55:40.671
I'm sorry, I, I have to go.

55:46.885 --> 55:49.345
- Hello and welcome
- to day three of the competition

55:49.387 --> 55:50.722
to beautiful Melbourne where

55:50.723 --> 55:52.057
it's really starting to hot up.

55:52.099 --> 55:53.600
- -Kelly, can I talk to you--
- -Not now.

55:53.642 --> 55:55.060
- -I just don't want you to--
- -Jess.

55:55.102 --> 55:56.520
- I'm trying to focus
- on the competition.

55:56.561 --> 55:57.938
- I don't need you
- in my head right now.

55:57.980 --> 55:59.461
-Yeah, but that's what I'm--

55:59.462 --> 56:00.941
-Don't worry.

56:00.983 --> 56:03.194
I'll be doing my very best...

56:03.235 --> 56:05.403
regardless of what you think.

56:07.865 --> 56:09.158
[Dave]

56:09.159 --> 56:10.450
So over the next few days,

56:07.865 --> 56:10.450
we'll see who qualifies

56:10.492 --> 56:12.202
for the annual Australian

56:12.203 --> 56:13.912
International Invitational.

56:13.954 --> 56:15.351
The Invitational which always

56:15.352 --> 56:16.748
follows the club competition

56:16.790 --> 56:19.043
where only the best and in-form

56:19.044 --> 56:21.295
Australian competitors qualify.

56:21.337 --> 56:23.005
- [Michelle]
- That's right, Dave, the first

56:23.047 --> 56:24.090
international competition

56:24.091 --> 56:25.132
of the year

56:25.174 --> 56:26.425
which always attracts

56:26.426 --> 56:27.676
the up-and-coming gymnasts

56:27.718 --> 56:30.428
from Australia and overseas.

56:30.470 --> 56:31.597
There are strong club teams

56:31.598 --> 56:32.723
again this year

56:32.764 --> 56:33.849
but we haven't had

56:33.850 --> 56:34.933
a club team qualify

56:34.975 --> 56:37.728
in the top five for years!

57:06.673 --> 57:09.343
[crowd cheering]

57:10.635 --> 57:11.595
[gym vault clunks]

57:11.636 --> 57:12.971
[soft thud]

57:26.860 --> 57:27.987
What were you saying

57:27.988 --> 57:29.113
about the dead weight?

58:50.486 --> 58:53.571
[applause]

59:42.579 --> 59:43.914
[applause]

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:38.260
- [Michelle]
- Beautiful routine from Kelly.

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:40.367
Will she try and pull out

01:00:40.368 --> 01:00:42.431
a big move in this last part?

01:00:49.271 --> 01:00:51.022
- [Michelle]
- No, it's just a front layout

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.732
- and she struggled
- on the landing, Dave.

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:54.318
- [Dave]
- Still having a hard time

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:55.860
with that final pass, Michelle.

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:57.862
- But we've seen
- some great gymnastics

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:58.968
from Kelly today

01:00:58.969 --> 01:01:00.031
and it's great to see her

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:02.117
back in competition.

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:03.494
[Michelle]

01:01:03.495 --> 01:01:04.828
Will you look at that?

01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:06.204
That is amazing.

01:01:06.205 --> 01:01:07.539
The Aerial Club Team...

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:09.187
Wait, we might qualify

01:01:09.188 --> 01:01:10.792
for the Invitationals.

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.669
- [Michelle]
- A real nail-biter.

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:14.171
And all the more tense because

01:01:14.172 --> 01:01:15.631
of that last-minute mistake

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.049
from Kelly Johnson

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:18.425
that might be...

01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:20.093
- Aren't you gonna say,
- "I told you so"?

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:22.095
- I didn't come here to be right,
- I came here to win.

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:23.347
[Dave]

01:01:23.348 --> 01:01:24.556
The scores will

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:24.556
now be totaled and we'll see...

01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:26.642
Good work, though.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:27.935
[Michelle]

01:01:27.936 --> 01:01:29.186
The scores

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.186
are coming through now.

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:31.188
[Dave]

01:01:31.189 --> 01:01:33.148
First to qualify, as expected,

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:33.148
the young Aussie Starlets.

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.527
- Next is
- the New South Wales team.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.238
Victoria are third.

01:01:43.325 --> 01:01:45.661
Queensland team are in, too.

01:01:48.246 --> 01:01:49.477
Aerial have been brave

01:01:49.478 --> 01:01:50.707
in their performance.

01:01:50.748 --> 01:01:51.979
That's amazing,

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.210
the Aerial Club Team

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:54.273
have qualified

01:01:54.274 --> 01:01:55.295
for the Invitationals.

01:01:55.337 --> 01:01:57.130
- [Michelle]
- That's the first time
in years, Dave

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:59.132
a club team has qualified.

01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:00.842
Congratulations to Aerial

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.469
and all the qualifying teams.

01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:03.720
Oh, my God!

01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:05.347
- [Dave]
- That sets up some fantastic

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:06.474
competition

01:02:06.475 --> 01:02:07.558
for the Invitational.

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:09.560
- We'll see Kelly Johnson
- back competing

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:11.645
in a big competition again.

01:02:11.646 --> 01:02:13.689
Look forward to that.

01:02:14.523 --> 01:02:15.899
[applause]

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:20.946
-Um, congratulations.

01:02:20.947 --> 01:02:22.447
-Oh, thank you.

01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:24.324
- -It was nice.
- -Thanks.

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:26.868
Good work.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.495
- Oh, awesome result,
- each of you--

01:02:28.537 --> 01:02:29.893
Oh, uh, Mom's here.

01:02:29.894 --> 01:02:31.248
Sorry, g-gotta go.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:33.500
Uh, talk later? Yeah?

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.088
Weird.

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:39.214
-Oh, you stink.

01:02:39.215 --> 01:02:40.298
-Seriously?

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.883
No, man. You're alright.

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:43.510
- Hey, what was
- with the handshake?

01:02:43.552 --> 01:02:45.303
Did she say something?

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:47.014
-I said, "Awesome result."

01:02:47.015 --> 01:02:48.682
-Oh, mate, that would do it.

01:02:48.724 --> 01:02:49.829
Maybe you should play

01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:50.934
hard to get.

01:02:56.356 --> 01:02:57.649
Okay, so I just got

01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:58.942
a list of the teams

01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:00.652
we will be competing against.

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:02.717
Uh, the Aussie teams

01:03:02.718 --> 01:03:04.740
which qualified, of course.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:08.868
Plus... France, UK

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.495
Germany, New Zealand

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:12.914
and the United States.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:16.105
Well... we've done, like,

01:03:16.106 --> 01:03:17.877
huge just to get here.

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:19.254
- -Yeah.
- -So...

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.089
- It doesn't really matter
- what happens.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:22.278
-Yeah.

01:03:22.279 --> 01:03:23.425
-What?

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:24.635
Why do you sound like

01:03:24.636 --> 01:03:25.802
you're giving up?

01:03:25.843 --> 01:03:26.844
Just because they're

01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:27.845
international gymnasts?

01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:29.931
They're just like us.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:31.224
Ashley, I have never seen you

01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:32.643
- look that amazing
- on the beam before.

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:33.706
And, Nic, this is

01:03:33.707 --> 01:03:34.728
your first competition

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:37.230
and you advanced.

01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:39.358
I mean, we're only point two

01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:41.443
behind the best Australian team.

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:42.486
We're gonna do

01:03:42.487 --> 01:03:43.487
even better tomorrow.

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:46.197
[sighs]

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.908
[chuckles]

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:50.014
Is it just me,

01:03:50.015 --> 01:03:51.077
or did it suddenly

01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:53.538
get all inspirational in here?

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.872
[chuckles]

01:03:56.792 --> 01:03:59.377
Wow, you're really determined.

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:00.921
It's more bravado

01:04:00.922 --> 01:04:02.422
than confidence, trust me.

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:06.551
I think it worked.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:08.616
Well, I mean, I guess

01:04:08.617 --> 01:04:10.639
I'm still a little nervous about

01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:11.682
competing against Megan,

01:04:11.683 --> 01:04:12.683
and my old team

01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:14.017
but this is my chance

01:04:14.018 --> 01:04:15.310
to show them

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:16.561
that they're wrong about me.

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:17.833
And that's exactly

01:04:17.834 --> 01:04:19.063
what I'm gonna do.

01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:20.336
This is a different story

01:04:20.337 --> 01:04:21.566
from last night.

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:22.900
What changed?

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:24.903
Well, a little pep talk

01:04:24.904 --> 01:04:26.863
with a friend.

01:04:26.904 --> 01:04:28.906
He told me to believe in myself

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:31.201
so... I'm trying it out.

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:32.994
Well, this friend of yours...

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:35.913
he sounds really... awesome

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:37.248
and, uh, handsome.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:38.938
-Hm, no, he's not.

01:04:38.939 --> 01:04:40.585
-Hey.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:51.971
Which one is Megan?

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:53.119
You can tell by the dagger

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.224
shooting out of her eyes

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:55.851
into the back of my head.

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.610
[chuckles]

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:07.945
You taught her well, Kelly.

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:11.095
Megan, you've been warned.

01:05:11.096 --> 01:05:12.784
Now cut it out.

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:14.786
-What?

01:05:14.787 --> 01:05:16.037
-Hey.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:18.039
Wait, what?

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:20.271
I guess she really appreciates

01:05:20.272 --> 01:05:22.460
him telling her to cut it out.

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:23.795
W-w-what are you doing here?

01:05:23.796 --> 01:05:25.088
I didn't know you were coming.

01:05:25.129 --> 01:05:27.090
- Well, I could say the same
- for you.

01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:28.487
Yeah, last minute replacement

01:05:28.488 --> 01:05:29.843
for Tara.

01:05:29.885 --> 01:05:31.261
- She couldn't be here
- till Saturday night

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:33.722
so they asked me to step in.

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:35.432
- Sorry, I didn't get
- a chance to tell you.

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:36.683
I, I thought I'd call

01:05:36.684 --> 01:05:37.893
and surprise you

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.644
while I was Down Under.

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:41.271
Uh, guys,

01:05:41.272 --> 01:05:42.856
this is my dad, Pete.

01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:45.234
This is Coach Mel, Nic,

01:05:45.235 --> 01:05:47.569
Jess and Ashley.

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:49.863
My Aerial gym team.

01:05:49.905 --> 01:05:51.907
Delighted to meet you all.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.346
I didn't know you were

01:05:53.347 --> 01:05:54.743
competing.

01:05:54.785 --> 01:05:56.870
"Aerial."

01:05:56.912 --> 01:05:57.996
You guys qualified

01:05:57.997 --> 01:05:59.080
for International.

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.207
Hey, congrats.

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:02.793
That's my girl.

01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:04.753
Well, we're about done.

01:06:04.795 --> 01:06:06.547
So the floor and the equipments'

01:06:06.548 --> 01:06:08.298
all yours.

01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:09.424
Uh, but you must wanna

01:06:09.425 --> 01:06:10.508
catch up with Kel.

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.260
- Uh, you know, actually,
- I'll just, uh...

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:13.637
I think I'll go back...

01:06:13.638 --> 01:06:14.971
with you guys.

01:06:15.012 --> 01:06:16.264
Are you sure?

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:17.495
I can drop you off

01:06:17.496 --> 01:06:18.683
at the hotel, Kels.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:20.310
- Why don't you stay?
- We can catch up.

01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:21.811
I-I don't wanna distract

01:06:21.812 --> 01:06:23.271
you guys from practice.

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:27.191
Team comes first, yeah.

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:28.547
We can catch up later

01:06:28.548 --> 01:06:29.861
after training then.

01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:33.552
Okay. You guys ready?

01:06:33.553 --> 01:06:35.241
Alright, bye.

01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:44.375
Good luck tomorrow, anchor.

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:47.671
Oh, sorry, did I say "anchor"?

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:48.859
I meant dead weight,

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:50.006
daddy's girl.

01:06:50.047 --> 01:06:52.049
See you on the floor.

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:57.472
It's alright.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.391
What is she going on about?

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.144
That's Megan. We used to compete

01:07:02.145 --> 01:07:03.854
together back home.

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:05.396
- My last two comps
- weren't that good

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:06.523
so she always liked to blame me

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:08.399
for the team's poor results.

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:09.922
Even though she always

01:07:09.923 --> 01:07:11.402
seems to forget

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:13.237
- that if she hadn't
- stepped out of bounds so much

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:15.281
we still would've placed.

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:17.575
Sorry to mention it, but...

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:18.931
it looked weird

01:07:18.932 --> 01:07:20.244
with your dad back there.

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:22.143
Yeah, I actually didn't tell him

01:07:22.144 --> 01:07:23.999
I was doing gymnastics again.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:26.376
Why?

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:28.127
Um, he always used to push me

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:30.005
- to try new things
- in competitions

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:32.340
that I wasn't really ready for.

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:34.197
It was a really big issue

01:07:34.198 --> 01:07:36.011
between him and my mom.

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:38.304
- She thought that he was putting
- too much pressure on me.

01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:39.889
He thought she wasn't pushing me

01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:41.432
to my full potential.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:42.851
And they fought about it

01:07:42.852 --> 01:07:44.227
all the time.

01:07:44.268 --> 01:07:45.583
And then, eventually, when I

01:07:45.584 --> 01:07:46.897
blew a really big tumbling pass

01:07:46.938 --> 01:07:48.606
in my last competition,

01:07:48.607 --> 01:07:50.274
they had a huge fight.

01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:52.485
And... the next week

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:54.404
- they told me they were
- separating.

01:07:54.445 --> 01:07:56.072
- [Ashley]
- Oh, God.

01:07:56.113 --> 01:07:58.115
So... I don't know

01:07:58.157 --> 01:07:59.847
I just didn't really

01:07:59.848 --> 01:08:01.536
wanna open it back up again.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.079
- And besides,
- I wanna prove that

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.831
I can do this without him.

01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:06.123
And show Megan and everyone

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.084
- that I deserve
- that spot on the team

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:09.377
and that it wasn't

01:08:09.378 --> 01:08:10.628
just favoritism.

01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:13.652
But I guess, it's just

01:08:13.653 --> 01:08:15.341
sort of awkward now.

01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:16.947
Well, the good thing is,

01:08:16.948 --> 01:08:18.511
you did it. You showed them.

01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:20.055
We wouldn't have even qualified

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.118
for the Invitational

01:08:21.118 --> 01:08:22.139
without your performance.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.370
Um, and your awesome vaults,

01:08:23.371 --> 01:08:24.559
Jess.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.894
I mean, you've got so much air

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.854
- I thought you were
- gonna fly in the stands.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:29.354
You know what, guys?

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:30.941
- I don't even care
- what this Megan thinks.

01:08:30.982 --> 01:08:32.526
Alright? We're all going

01:08:32.527 --> 01:08:34.069
to smash it out tomorrow.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:35.591
We'll make her regret ever

01:08:35.591 --> 01:08:37.072
taking a trip Down Under.

01:08:37.906 --> 01:08:39.991
[chuckles]

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:54.255
I thought she did really well.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.840
-Kelly.

01:08:55.841 --> 01:08:57.383
-Yeah, I guess she looked okay.

01:08:57.425 --> 01:08:58.613
I mean, she did alright

01:08:58.615 --> 01:08:59.803
in that stupid club comp

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:01.054
but she'll freak out like before

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:02.430
and tank it

01:09:02.432 --> 01:09:03.765
in the big comp tomorrow.

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:05.183
Trust me, I mean, she just

01:09:05.184 --> 01:09:06.559
doesn't have what it takes

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.727
and it'll be like last year,

01:09:07.728 --> 01:09:08.853
all over again.

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:09.979
Well, she was going through

01:09:09.981 --> 01:09:11.064
a lot back then.

01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:12.523
She's just not tough enough.

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:14.524
- I mean, daddy can't
- save her this time

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:16.903
and she'll crash and burn.

01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:18.194
I'm calling it.

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:21.742
Kelly did confide in me

01:09:21.743 --> 01:09:22.826
how hard it was for her

01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:23.952
in those final comps

01:09:23.953 --> 01:09:25.036
before she quit.

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:26.183
Her parents were fighting

01:09:26.184 --> 01:09:27.287
all the time.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.832
She couldn't focus.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:29.874
With her dad as coach,

01:09:29.875 --> 01:09:30.875
the pressure on her

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:32.335
must've been huge.

01:09:32.376 --> 01:09:33.482
I mean, I feel really

01:09:33.483 --> 01:09:34.587
sorry for her now.

01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:36.589
She did awesome yesterday.

01:09:36.631 --> 01:09:38.424
- Just our luck to get caught
- in a cross fight

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:40.468
between Kelly and Megan.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:42.179
If we lose to a club team,

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:43.846
even if Kelly is in it

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:45.118
we'll be a complete

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.349
laughing stock.

01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:57.318
[sniffles]

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.862
[sobs]

01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:03.449
- [Sarah]
- Kel?

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.203
Kelly, honey, what's wrong?

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:10.582
I don't think this

01:10:10.583 --> 01:10:11.708
was a good idea.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:14.169
What, the competition?

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.341
The competition,

01:10:19.342 --> 01:10:21.051
competing without Dad.

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:23.427
Megan, all of it.

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:24.846
Isn't this what you wanted?

01:10:24.888 --> 01:10:26.181
To win without your dad?

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.808
Mom, Dad's here.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.810
Your father's here?

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:32.687
He said he was a last-minute

01:10:32.688 --> 01:10:34.522
replacement for Tara.

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.607
- I saw him today.
- I had no idea what to say.

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:39.069
It was so weird.

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:41.487
- I just wanted to help Nic
- get on the team before she quit

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:42.739
and then,

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:43.948
with Megan pushing my buttons

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.429
I just thought I could

01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:46.868
prove something to myself

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:49.495
and... to Dad, too.

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:53.124
Isn't that what you're doing?

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.168
Mom, I just, I just feel

01:10:55.169 --> 01:10:57.170
the pressure of it all now.

01:10:57.212 --> 01:10:59.422
Especially with Dad here,

01:10:59.423 --> 01:11:01.632
it just... feels so wrong.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:05.470
Honey, I-I know you're upset.

01:11:05.471 --> 01:11:06.930
But what feels so wrong?

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.559
I know it was my fault

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.852
you and Dad separated.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:17.232
What? What?

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:18.733
Is that what you think?

01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:21.986
Dad was mad

01:11:21.987 --> 01:11:23.154
because I was messing up.

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:24.343
And then you were mad

01:11:24.344 --> 01:11:25.489
because he was mad.

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:26.741
All because...

01:11:26.742 --> 01:11:27.951
I couldn't do the moves

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:29.660
- that I should've been
- able to do.

01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:31.392
So I thought if I quit,

01:11:31.393 --> 01:11:33.081
you and Dad would stop fighting

01:11:33.123 --> 01:11:34.791
and now I'm back to competing.

01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:36.459
Kelly, Kelly,

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:38.086
honey, listen to me.

01:11:38.128 --> 01:11:40.297
What happened between your

01:11:40.298 --> 01:11:42.465
father and me is not your fault.

01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:43.945
We were fighting

01:11:43.946 --> 01:11:45.384
about everything.

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:46.636
Not just you

01:11:46.637 --> 01:11:47.845
and the competitions.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.266
Look at me.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:53.059
With the pressure at my job

01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:54.269
and the pressure on your dad

01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:55.436
to win the competitions

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:56.855
we just lost sight

01:11:56.856 --> 01:11:58.231
of each other.

01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:01.276
It was not because of you.

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:05.259
What you've just achieved

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:06.948
here is amazing.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.576
To come back, to compete

01:12:09.577 --> 01:12:10.827
after all that time away

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:12.453
and with barely any time

01:12:12.454 --> 01:12:14.038
to prepare.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.748
And you did it on your own.

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:17.250
On your own terms.

01:12:17.292 --> 01:12:19.376
I'm so proud of you, honey.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:21.629
And I know your dad

01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:22.755
will be, too.

01:12:24.465 --> 01:12:25.800
You need to make decisions

01:12:25.801 --> 01:12:27.135
that are right for you,

01:12:27.177 --> 01:12:28.491
not for me

01:12:28.492 --> 01:12:29.804
and not for your dad.

01:12:31.181 --> 01:12:32.890
What's right for you.

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:37.478
Honey.

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:40.273
[sniffles]

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:50.074
[upbeat music]

01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:04.297
This is Jordyn Wieber,

01:13:04.298 --> 01:13:05.340
reporting live

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:06.528
from the Australian

01:13:06.529 --> 01:13:07.675
Invitational.

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:09.177
The Australian Invitational

01:13:09.178 --> 01:13:10.636
is always scheduled outside

01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:12.096
of the main competition season

01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:13.681
- to let the young,
- up-and-coming gymnasts

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.016
have their first taste

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:16.600
of international competition.

01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:18.561
[cheering]

01:13:18.602 --> 01:13:20.646
- I'm here with Lauren Bell,
- whose sister Sophie

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:21.752
is competing

01:13:21.753 --> 01:13:22.815
with the US team here.

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:24.567
- Are you excited to be here
- with your sister?

01:13:24.608 --> 01:13:26.173
I'm so excited. I can't wait to

01:13:26.174 --> 01:13:27.737
compete here one day, too.

01:13:34.535 --> 01:13:37.121
He's cute.

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:38.602
Did your daddy

01:13:38.603 --> 01:13:40.041
help you get him, too?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.002
You know what, Megan?

01:13:43.044 --> 01:13:44.150
I used to think

01:13:44.151 --> 01:13:45.255
if I was good enough

01:13:45.296 --> 01:13:46.735
if I won enough comps,

01:13:46.736 --> 01:13:48.174
you would like me

01:13:48.216 --> 01:13:50.301
and we could be friends.

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:52.011
- But you know
- what I realized?

01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:53.554
That you're not good enough?

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:57.267
No. That I just don't care.

01:13:57.308 --> 01:13:59.727
You might be a good gymnast,

01:13:59.728 --> 01:14:02.146
but you are not a good person.

01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:04.065
At least I'm a good gymnast.

01:14:04.107 --> 01:14:05.649
You can't even say that.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.944
- We'll see what the scores are
- at the end of the day.

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:09.862
Yeah, you can check out my site.

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:11.301
I'll post some photos of me

01:14:11.302 --> 01:14:12.698
and my gold medal.

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:16.077
You can touch the screen.

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:17.995
- That's the closest
- you're gonna get to one.

01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:39.142
[crowd cheering]

01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:52.802
[together]

01:14:52.803 --> 01:14:54.324
Three, two, one, Aerial!

01:14:54.365 --> 01:14:55.658
- [male announcer]
- Welcome the team

01:14:55.699 --> 01:14:56.805
from the United States

01:14:56.806 --> 01:14:57.910
of America.

01:14:57.952 --> 01:14:59.996
[crowd cheering]

01:15:00.037 --> 01:15:01.101
Put your hands together,

01:15:01.102 --> 01:15:02.165
our team

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:04.250
all the way from France.

01:15:04.292 --> 01:15:07.128
[cheering]

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:08.525
Please welcome our team

01:15:08.526 --> 01:15:09.880
from Germany!

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:11.715
[cheering]

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:13.384
Gymnasts, please march to

01:15:13.385 --> 01:15:15.011
your first apparatus

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:16.074
and present yourselves

01:15:16.075 --> 01:15:17.096
to the judges.

01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:18.890
[Dave]

01:15:18.891 --> 01:15:20.641
That's the presentation out of

01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:20.641
the way. Now the competition.

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:22.936
And this will be a fascinating

01:15:22.937 --> 01:15:25.188
competition to watch.

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:26.772
The small time Aerial team

01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:28.253
with ex-American

01:15:28.254 --> 01:15:29.692
junior champion Kelly Johnson

01:15:29.733 --> 01:15:31.277
on the same rotation

01:15:31.278 --> 01:15:32.820
as the American team

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:34.822
- with some of her
- former teammates.

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:36.219
[Michelle]

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.574
As this is a teams' event,

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:37.574
they'll have to put up

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:39.744
three outstanding gymnastic

01:15:39.745 --> 01:15:41.871
routines on each apparatus.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:43.644
We saw Jess Watkins score

01:15:43.645 --> 01:15:45.375
very well yesterday.

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:46.959
- There are college scouts
- out here

01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:48.107
and they'll be

01:15:48.108 --> 01:15:49.212
watching her today.

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:51.422
We also saw good performances

01:15:51.464 --> 01:15:53.383
from both Nicola Mathews

01:15:53.384 --> 01:15:55.301
and Ashley Bryant.

01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:56.824
[Dave]

01:15:56.825 --> 01:15:58.304
Of course, Kelly had that final

01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:58.304
floor-routine disaster

01:15:58.346 --> 01:15:59.722
with her father coaching her

01:15:59.763 --> 01:16:01.057
in the US Junior Nationals

01:16:01.058 --> 01:16:02.350
last season.

01:16:02.392 --> 01:16:03.727
And with that big stumble

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:24.497
from Megan McCormack.

01:16:24.539 --> 01:16:25.686
That's enough to put her

01:16:25.687 --> 01:16:26.832
in the lead

01:16:26.874 --> 01:16:29.502

Jess' routine and score

01:18:44.679 --> 01:18:46.096

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:47.598

01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:51.852

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:52.979
She's gonna have to be

Wow, oh, wow!

01:25:06.309 --> 01:25:08.562
That was beautiful. Amazing.

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:10.252
[Michelle]

01:25:10.253 --> 01:25:11.899
A double Arabian! That skill is

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:11.899
worth an extra half a point

01:25:11.941 --> 01:25:13.401
on her score. This wasn't a

01:25:13.402 --> 01:25:14.860
planned part of the routine.

01:25:14.902 --> 01:25:16.049
A double Arabian,

01:25:16.050 --> 01:25:17.195
that's a half twist

01:25:17.237 --> 01:25:19.656
with a double front somersault.

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:21.304
[Dave]

01:25:21.305 --> 01:25:22.910
She must have added it to make

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:22.910
up for that error, Michelle.

01:25:22.952 --> 01:25:24.369
This was the move that cost

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:26.371
- Kelly's team the gold
- last year.

01:25:26.413 --> 01:25:27.539
And this year,

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:28.665
it may be just what wins it

01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:31.167
for her and the team.

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:32.544
Michelle, just waiting

01:25:32.545 --> 01:25:33.879
on the final places.

01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:35.923
Aerial has won silver!

01:25:35.965 --> 01:25:37.654
The small Aerial club

01:25:37.655 --> 01:25:39.342
have taken the silver.

01:25:39.384 --> 01:25:41.782
-Silver? We took silver?

01:25:41.783 --> 01:25:44.180
-But it's not gold.

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:45.682
- We weren't even supposed
- to be good enough

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.684
- to get into the Invitationals.
- We just medaled!

01:25:49.436 --> 01:25:51.605
stunning performance

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:53.190

01:25:53.191 --> 01:25:54.733
by the smallest of margins.

01:25:54.775 --> 01:25:56.485
Incredible!

Hey, what's with that look?

01:25:58.092 --> 01:25:59.655
She just took gold.

01:26:01.364 --> 01:26:02.470

01:26:11.207 --> 01:26:12.876
Good work, Kel.

01:26:12.918 --> 01:26:13.919
Glad we had that pep talk

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:14.920
about being an anchor.

01:26:14.962 --> 01:26:16.463
Oh, you call that a pep talk?

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:17.840
It worked, didn't it?

Hey, what's going on?

Uh, somebody might have

01:26:37.235 --> 01:26:39.361
mentioned to the US coaches

01:26:39.402 --> 01:26:40.925
that their star gymnast

01:26:40.926 --> 01:26:42.447
was a cyber-bully.

01:26:42.489 --> 01:26:43.865
I hear there's a pretty strict

01:26:43.866 --> 01:26:45.241
policy on that sort of thing.

Did you get Tara to ask me?

Oh, well, Tara asked me

01:29:55.892 --> 01:29:57.475
if I thought

- you were up to coming back,
- and I said yes.

who is a tutor or a coach.

01:30:30.175 --> 01:30:33.136
I just want a dad who's a dad.

01:30:33.178 --> 01:30:35.347
But this is the Olympics.

you've always wanted.

And it hasn't been for a while.

01:30:52.031 --> 01:30:53.698
my dad and not my coach

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:55.284

what's best for you.

01:31:06.128 --> 01:31:07.545
then that's okay.

01:31:08.838 --> 01:31:10.132

on being a coach.

You know, chasing the dream.

01:31:14.303 --> 01:31:15.721
I think I've forgotten

01:31:15.722 --> 01:31:17.139
how to be a dad and a husband.

01:31:19.473 --> 01:31:20.558
I don't wanna be

01:31:20.559 --> 01:31:21.643
without you or your mom.

01:31:28.191 --> 01:31:30.277
So are we okay?

01:31:30.319 --> 01:31:33.613
We're better than okay.

01:31:33.655 --> 01:31:34.823
What about your mom?

01:31:34.864 --> 01:31:36.032
You think she might be up to

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:38.785
talking to me again?

01:31:38.827 --> 01:31:40.621
That might take

01:31:40.622 --> 01:31:42.414
a little more work.

01:31:42.456 --> 01:31:44.187
But if I've learned anything

01:31:44.188 --> 01:31:45.917
from my gymnastics coach

01:31:45.959 --> 01:31:48.045
it's that if you love something,

01:31:48.046 --> 01:31:50.130
it's worth the work.

01:31:50.172 --> 01:31:51.360
You know, now with Jess gone,

01:31:51.361 --> 01:31:52.548
that'd make you head girl.

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:54.113
-It could be alright.

01:31:54.114 --> 01:31:55.635
-Yeah.

01:31:55.677 --> 01:31:57.220
So what happened?

01:31:57.262 --> 01:31:58.764
Um, well, she sort of offered me

01:31:58.765 --> 01:32:00.265
a shot at the Olympics

01:32:00.307 --> 01:32:01.766
- to go back
- and train with the team.

01:32:01.808 --> 01:32:03.977
That's awesome.

01:32:10.025 --> 01:32:11.964
Kel, you're not gonna go,

01:32:11.965 --> 01:32:13.903

01:32:16.948 --> 01:32:19.493
Are you mad that I'm not going?

01:32:19.533 --> 01:32:21.411
Of course not.

01:32:21.453 --> 01:32:22.746
But are you sure

01:32:22.747 --> 01:32:24.039
this is what you want?

- This is a huge opportunity,

I just feel like I found myself.

01:32:31.171 --> 01:32:33.715
I have nothing to prove.

I just want some time for me.

01:32:37.593 --> 01:32:38.657
And I wanna have
