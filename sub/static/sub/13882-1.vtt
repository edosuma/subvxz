# To Ganymede and Titan,
Yes, sir, I've been around... #

01:05.600 --> 01:09.718
Lister, have you ever been hit
over the head with a welding mallet?

01:10.360 --> 01:12.920
No? Stop that and push the trolley.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.199
Yes, sir, Rimmer!

01:15.920 --> 01:18.798
Right. Corridor 159.

01:23.120 --> 01:24.553
Lister, shut up!

01:24.640 --> 01:26.710
- I'm only humming!
- Well, don't.

01:31.400 --> 01:35.552
Don't hum and don't make
stupid sounds with your cheeks.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.593
One more sound, anything,
and you're on report, my laddo.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.398
What job number's this?

01:49.040 --> 01:50.712
Right! That's it!

01:51.120 --> 01:53.156
"Lister, D., Third Technician.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.994
"Offence: obstructing a superior technician

01:57.080 --> 01:59.958
"by humming, clicking and being quiet. "

02:01.480 --> 02:03.357
When the Captain sees this, you're dead.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.636
- Rimmer, I'm bored!
- Bored?!

02:05.720 --> 02:07.870
This is essential routine maintenance.

02:07.960 --> 02:12.556
It's absolutely vital for the well-being
of this crew, this mission and this ship.

02:13.240 --> 02:17.791
"Dispenser 172: chicken soup nozzle clogged. "

02:21.280 --> 02:23.271
Pass me a 14B, Lister.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.836
Lister, is this a 14B?

02:29.920 --> 02:32.957
Does it look even remotely like a 14B?

02:35.440 --> 02:38.273
This is a 14B, Lister.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.233
This is a 14F. Are you blind?

02:41.400 --> 02:43.630
- Who cares?
- I care, Lister!

02:48.240 --> 02:50.834
It's my career. I get it in the neck

02:50.920 --> 02:53.150
if an officer comes along, orders chicken soup,

02:53.240 --> 02:58.314
and gets blackcurrant cordial
with blancmange, two creams and a sugar.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.751
Chicken soup.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.236
Yep. That's working.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.473
It's stupid, all this maintenance business.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.677
The only reason they don't give
this job to the service robots

03:16.760 --> 03:18.671
is they've got a better union than us.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.716
That is absolute nonsense.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.791
Right. What's next?

03:22.880 --> 03:24.950
"Botanical gardens: faulty porous circuit.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.838
"In corridor 147: sticking door. "

03:28.800 --> 03:30.791
It's true, you know, though, Rimmer.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.269
You rank below all four of those service robots.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.510
Even the one that's gone absolutely mad.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.558
Not for long, matey. Up, up, up!
That's where I'm going!

03:38.720 --> 03:40.711
Not till you pass your engineer's exam.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.871
And you won't. You'll go in and flunk again.

03:43.080 --> 03:47.312
Last time I only failed
by the "narrowest" of narrow margins.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.789
You what? You walked in there, wrote,

03:49.880 --> 03:52.599
"I am a fish," 400 times,

03:52.680 --> 03:54.796
did a funny little dance, and fainted.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.838
- That's a total lie!
- No, it's not! Petersen told me.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.791
"No, it's not! Petersen told me. "

03:59.880 --> 04:03.316
What I did was, I wrote
a discourse on porous circuits

04:03.400 --> 04:06.676
which was simply
too "radical", too "unconventional",

04:06.760 --> 04:08.637
too "mould-breaking" for the examiners.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.916
Yeah. You said you were a fish.

04:11.800 --> 04:15.076
- Is that a cigarette you're smoking?
- No, it's a chicken.

04:15.240 --> 04:19.630
Right! You're on report.
Two times in as many minutes, Lister!

04:20.200 --> 04:22.111
- Rimmer, Lister.
- Yes, sir.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.316
Yo, Todhunter, get down!

04:24.640 --> 04:28.110
Indeed. Rimmer, I'm going
through Mclntyre's artifacts,

04:28.200 --> 04:32.990
and I see that you've filed
247 complaints... against Lister.

04:33.160 --> 04:38.553
- Yes, sir!
- 123 counts of insulting a superior,

04:38.640 --> 04:41.518
39 counts of dereliction of duty,

04:41.600 --> 04:43.477
84 counts of insubordination,

04:43.560 --> 04:46.313
- and one count of mutiny.
- Yes, sir!

04:46.480 --> 04:49.040
- Mutiny, Lister?
- I stood on his toe.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.636
- Maliciously, with intent to wound.
- It was an accident!

04:52.800 --> 04:56.076
How is it possible to stand
on one small toe by accident?

04:56.160 --> 04:58.993
You didn't stand on my toe,
you stood on my entire foot,

04:59.080 --> 05:01.719
obstructing a superior in pursuit of duty.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.314
He was going to snap my guitar in half!

05:04.480 --> 05:07.552
So you leapt from the top bunk
onto the whole of my right foot.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.950
- That's enough.
- Had there been a crisis,

05:10.040 --> 05:11.632
I would have had to hop,

05:11.720 --> 05:14.029
putting the ship at risk, therefore mutiny.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.668
- Finished?
- I'm not vindictive,

05:16.760 --> 05:18.512
so I won't apply for the death penalty.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.591
There are 169 people on this ship.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.991
You, Rimmer, are over one man.
Why can't you two get on?

05:24.160 --> 05:27.630
I try, sir. I'm not an insubordinate man by nature.

05:27.720 --> 05:30.234
I try to respect Rimmer, but it's not easy.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.958
He's such a smeghead.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.312
Did you hear that, sir?
Lister, do you have any conception

05:36.400 --> 05:39.676
of the penalty for calling
a superior technician a smeghead?

05:39.840 --> 05:43.992
Oh, Rimmer. You ARE a smeghead.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.310
You heard that! With respect, sir,
your career's finished, you big lig!

05:52.920 --> 05:56.993
We are gathered today
to pay our last respects to George Mclntyre.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.594
George was an excellent officer

05:59.680 --> 06:02.069
and as good a friend as one could hope for.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.391
He'll be missed more deeply
than he could ever know.

06:05.480 --> 06:09.268
Now, I commend his ashes
to the stars he loved so much.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.160
Goodbye, George, we'll miss you.

06:19.400 --> 06:23.518
This is a piece of music
he requested. Start the tape, please.

06:23.600 --> 06:28.469
# See you later, alligator
In a while, crocodile... #

06:29.440 --> 06:31.351
There goes Mclntyre.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.477
#.. so long! Goodbye! #
Goodbye George.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.391
- That was George!
- I thought it was Mary Queen of Scots!

06:39.480 --> 06:40.993
Off!

06:41.160 --> 06:43.674
- I was watching that!
- Tough!

06:44.320 --> 06:48.791
You touch that guitar and I'll
remove the E string and garrotte you.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.714
Can I do anything? Is it OK
if I breathe? Can I breathe?

06:54.880 --> 06:57.553
I have an exam tomorrow and I intend to pass.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.711
By cheating.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.917
This is not cheating!
It is merely an aid to memory.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.116
It helps me marshal the facts at my command.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.397
What? Copying entire textbooks onto your body?

07:08.480 --> 07:11.631
Hand your body in and let them mark that!

07:12.520 --> 07:15.796
Do you think it is easy for someone
like me to become an officer?

07:15.880 --> 07:17.996
Who wasn't Academy educated?

07:18.080 --> 07:22.073
Who didn't have the right
nobby background or the right parents?

07:22.240 --> 07:25.357
Not the right parents? Whose did you have?

07:26.480 --> 07:28.675
MY parents. The wrong parents.

07:28.760 --> 07:32.150
If you can't pass fair and square, why bother?

07:32.280 --> 07:35.158
You would, Lister,
because you've no ambition, no drive.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.595
You're content to be the lowest rank on the ship.

07:37.760 --> 07:41.639
I'm not the lowest rank.
What about the laboratory mice?

07:41.720 --> 07:44.678
Tell the mice to do something
and they've got to jump to it.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.752
"Yes, Mr Lister, sir! Eee, eee, eee. "

07:48.120 --> 07:50.429
Lister, you are a nothing.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.238
I'm not. I've got me plan.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.949
What, to be the slobbiest entity
in the entire universe?

07:56.120 --> 07:58.759
No. Me Five Year Plan.

07:58.840 --> 08:02.150
I'm going to do two more trips.
I've been saving up all me pay...

08:02.240 --> 08:04.470
- Since when?
- Since always.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.950
That's why I don't buy
soap, deodorant, socks or suchlike.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.873
I'm going to buy myself a little farm on Fiji

08:10.960 --> 08:13.872
and I'm going to get a sheep
and a cow and breed horses.

08:17.120 --> 08:20.396
- With a sheep and a cow?
- No, with horses and horses.

08:20.480 --> 08:23.472
- On Fiji?
- Yeah! The prices are unbelievable.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.676
Yes, because of a volcanic eruption,

08:25.760 --> 08:27.990
now most of Fiji is three feet below sea level!

08:28.160 --> 08:30.151
It's only three feet. They can wade.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.472
That's why the animals are
gonna have to be quite tall.

08:34.559 --> 08:38.951
Nice plan, Lister! Excellent plan!
Brilliant plan, Lister!

08:39.200 --> 08:42.556
What about the sheep? Buy them water wings?

08:43.159 --> 08:44.957
Fit them with stilts?

08:45.040 --> 08:49.238
Cross-breed them with dolphins
and have leaping mutton!

08:49.320 --> 08:52.517
Baa, spoosh, baa, spoosh.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.754
You can get a drainage grant these days.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.912
Why bother?
Be the first to produce wet-look knitwear!

09:00.000 --> 09:04.039
This is why I never said anything
to you, I knew you'd be like this.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.839
You have got the brain of a cheese sandwich.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.911
"Mornin', Farmer Lister!

09:09.000 --> 09:13.118
"Just popping to the shops in my submarine.
Can I buy you anything?"

09:14.280 --> 09:18.159
The "Welcome Back George Mclntyre"
reception is starting,

09:18.320 --> 09:20.117
Everybody is invited,

09:20.280 --> 09:23.670
especially those who weren't
able to attend his funeral,

09:43.560 --> 09:47.155
- Have you seen Rimmer's arm?
- No, I'm waiting for the paperback!

09:49.400 --> 09:51.595
Petersen, have you got a coin?

09:53.840 --> 09:56.354
Watch this great new intelligence test.

09:56.440 --> 09:59.318
What you gotta do is force
the coin onto your forehead.

09:59.400 --> 10:04.554
The more times you bang yourself on the head
without it falling, the more intelligent you are.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.757
- You gonna go for it?
- He's going for it!

10:07.840 --> 10:10.798
- Are you ready? Can you feel it?
- Yeah!

10:10.880 --> 10:13.553
Can you feel it? Go!

10:13.640 --> 10:16.473
Go on! Go for it!

10:16.680 --> 10:18.432
Brrr... brrr... brrr.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.791
- Brrr... brrr... brrr...
- Sh! Sh!

10:24.120 --> 10:27.430
Folks, today is a day for both sadness and joy.

10:27.520 --> 10:31.274
Sadness for the passing away of George, and joy,

10:31.360 --> 10:34.750
because George is back... albeit as a hologram.

10:34.840 --> 10:39.436
You may not have travelled with a hologram
before - just treat him as a normal man,

10:39.520 --> 10:42.592
because he is in every respect like George.

10:42.680 --> 10:46.434
He has George's personality,
knowledge and his experience.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.193
He can't lift or touch anything,

10:49.280 --> 10:52.078
so I ask you to cooperate with his requests.

10:52.160 --> 10:55.277
Please take care not to walk through him,

10:55.360 --> 10:57.351
not even when you're in a hurry.

10:57.520 --> 11:00.990
Whoa! Whoa! Speech! Speech!

11:05.200 --> 11:10.354
I want to thank everybody
for giving me such a marvellous funeral.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.431
I've just seen the vid.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.558
And I want to thank the Captain
for his beautiful eulogy.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.512
Beautiful.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.148
But why didn't he use the one I wrote?!

11:23.320 --> 11:27.233
This must seem pretty spooky for everyone,

11:27.320 --> 11:31.711
but I don't want you to think
of me as someone who's dead,

11:31.800 --> 11:35.429
more as someone who's no longer
a threat to your marriages.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.273
Joe knows what I mean.

11:42.880 --> 11:47.795
As you know, Holly's only
capable of sustaining one hologram.

11:47.880 --> 11:51.953
So, my advice to anyone
more vital to the mission than me is:

11:52.040 --> 11:53.871
if you die, I'll kill you.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.157
Please be upstanding for the cutting of the cake.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.511
Flight Coordinator George Mclntyre.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.352
George!

12:20.280 --> 12:23.158
OK. Just one thing before the disco.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.312
Holly has sensed a non-human life form aboard.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.392
Sir, it's Rimmer!

12:28.560 --> 12:32.189
We don't know what it is, Lister.
So just be careful, OK?

12:32.360 --> 12:34.157
I'm turning you in, Rimmer.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.470
Ooooh!

12:38.200 --> 12:40.555
They're bound to ask the right thigh,

12:40.640 --> 12:42.358
which is 10%.

12:42.440 --> 12:46.035
They must ask the left thigh, which is 20%.

12:46.120 --> 12:48.759
They've got to ask one of the forearms.

12:48.920 --> 12:52.230
Which means I've passed already!
The left shin's a bonus!

12:54.440 --> 12:57.796
Right. Cutie: current under tension is...

12:57.880 --> 13:00.678
What's this? Current under tension is equal?

13:00.760 --> 13:03.638
Current under tension is expandable?

13:03.720 --> 13:06.188
Current under tension is expensive?

13:06.280 --> 13:10.353
What does this mean?
What does any of this mean?

13:10.440 --> 13:13.318
I've covered my body in complete and utter

13:13.400 --> 13:16.790
and total absolute nonsense gibberish!

13:16.880 --> 13:20.998
Aaaargh! Just relax, relax, relax, relax...

13:22.120 --> 13:25.157
Er, plus 20% of the ship's course minus

13:25.240 --> 13:28.789
the Pythagoras theorem
multiplied by two over the x axis

13:28.880 --> 13:30.950
minus one equals the total
velocity of Red Dwarf,

13:31.040 --> 13:32.553
so I know about astro-engineering.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.108
Morning, Lister, for probably the last time.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.275
Got it all down, have you, Rimmer?

13:38.360 --> 13:40.476
Couple of blanks, but I think I'm there.

13:40.560 --> 13:43.074
So you can't remember anything?

13:43.200 --> 13:45.236
Think what you will, Lister.

13:45.320 --> 13:49.791
F- I-S-H, that's how you spell "Fish".
Then you just keel over.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.075
I'm sure it'll all come flooding back.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.312
Dry up, Lister.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.718
Entrants for the engineer's examination,

13:58.800 --> 14:00.836
make their way to the teaching room,

14:00.920 --> 14:03.195
Well, Rimmer, honestly, good luck.

14:04.800 --> 14:09.112
It's all right, Lister.
I'm in complete and total control.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.673
Lock! Lock!

14:31.480 --> 14:34.790
Frankenstein! Come on, Frankenstein!

14:41.640 --> 14:44.712
Oh, you're getting really big now, you know?

14:44.800 --> 14:48.554
I hope it's not twins.
You've already got all me milk ration.

14:48.640 --> 14:52.599
When the baby cat comes,
we'll give it water and pretend it's milk.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.636
It's only a baby cat, it won't know, eh?

14:54.720 --> 14:57.393
Do you want to see my picture of Fiji, Frankie?

14:57.480 --> 14:59.948
You'll love it there. Look.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.310
OK. You've got three hours.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.472
No modems, no speaking slide-rules.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.994
Turn over and start. Good luck.

16:39.880 --> 16:44.032
- Where's the Captain's office?
- Where it says, "Captain's Office".

16:44.120 --> 16:47.271
- Where it's always been.
- So that's the Captain's office!

16:47.360 --> 16:49.828
- How are you, then?
- Fine.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.512
Do you know why he wants me?

16:51.600 --> 16:54.160
I think you've been promoted to Admiral!

16:54.240 --> 16:55.878
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

16:55.960 --> 16:59.873
- For your devotion to duty.
- Oh, yeah.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.031
Lister!

17:05.839 --> 17:07.751
You asked to see me, Captain?

17:08.440 --> 17:12.637
- Where's the cat?
- What? What cat?

17:12.880 --> 17:16.156
Lister, not only are you so stupid

17:16.240 --> 17:18.390
you bring an unquarantined animal

17:18.480 --> 17:20.993
and jeopardise everyone on this ship...

17:21.079 --> 17:25.118
but you take a photo of yourself with the cat

17:25.200 --> 17:27.667
and have it internally processed.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.838
I'll ask you again, do you have a cat?

17:32.040 --> 17:34.793
- No.
- Have you got a cat?

17:34.960 --> 17:36.837
Er, yes, that one.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.991
- Where did you get it, Titan?
- Yes.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.719
Don't you realise
it could be carrying "anything"?

17:41.800 --> 17:44.792
Don't you remember what happened
on Oregon with the rabbits?

17:44.880 --> 17:47.917
Lister, a loose animal aboard
this ship could get anywhere.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.878
It could get into the air ducts or into Holly.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.918
A little nibble here
and a little nibble there, Lister,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.639
and suddenly, we're flying backwards.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.234
I want that cat, and I want it NOW.

17:59.400 --> 18:03.313
Sir, just suppose I did have a cat. Just suppose.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.709
What would you do with Frankenstein?

18:05.880 --> 18:09.668
Send it to the medical centre,
have it cut up and tests run on it.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.070
Would you put it back together, after?

18:12.680 --> 18:15.240
Lister, the cat would be dead.

18:15.360 --> 18:18.113
With respect, sir, what's in it for the cat?

18:18.280 --> 18:20.032
Give me that cat.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.909
It's not that easy. Me and the cat
are going to have a baby cat,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.878
and we're going to buy a farm on Fiji,

18:26.960 --> 18:29.520
with a sheep and a cow and three horses.

18:29.600 --> 18:34.037
It's me plan, and no one can get in the way,
not even you, and I do respect you.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.231
- Sir!
- Lister,

18:36.320 --> 18:40.233
do you want to go into stasis
and forfeit 18 months' wages?

18:40.320 --> 18:42.117
- No
- Hand over the cat?

18:42.200 --> 18:45.158
- No.
- Choose.

18:46.400 --> 18:50.678
- Dave, no one wants to do this.
- It's OK, I can handle it.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.357
- Rimmer, are you all right?
- I can't really remember.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.431
I think I did quite well.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.798
- Is this going to hurt?
- Haven't you travelled interstellar?

19:02.880 --> 19:04.552
- No
- You don't feel a thing.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.438
The stasis room creates a static field of time.

19:07.520 --> 19:11.911
As X-rays can't pass through lead,
time can't penetrate a stasis field.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.514
Though you exist, you no longer exist in time,

19:14.600 --> 19:16.511
and for you time does not exist.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.956
You're still a mass, but no longer
an event in space-time,

19:20.040 --> 19:22.679
a non-event mass
with quantum probability of zero.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.432
Simple, eh?

19:24.800 --> 19:27.553
- OK, I'm ready.
- See you in 18 months.

19:29.160 --> 19:32.436
- Holly, activate the stasis field.
- OK, Frank.

19:53.360 --> 19:57.035
Good morning, Dave, It is safe
for you to emerge from stasis,

19:57.120 --> 20:00.908
- Haven't I just gone in?
- Go to the Drive Room for debriefing,

20:06.360 --> 20:08.351
Where is everybody, Hol?

20:08.440 --> 20:11.318
- They're dead, Dave,
- Who is?

20:11.400 --> 20:15.279
- Everybody, Dave,
- What, Captain Hollister?

20:15.360 --> 20:19.035
- Everybody's dead, Dave,
- What, Todhunter?

20:19.120 --> 20:23.352
- Everybody's dead, Dave,
- What, Selby?

20:23.520 --> 20:26.273
They're all dead, Everybody's dead, Dave,

20:27.120 --> 20:30.715
- Petersen isn't, is he?
- Everybody is dead, Dave,

20:31.480 --> 20:35.268
- Not Chen?
- Gordon Bennet! Yes! Everybody,

20:35.360 --> 20:38.158
- Everybody's dead, Dave,
- Rimmer?

20:38.240 --> 20:42.233
He's dead, Dave, Everybody's dead,
Everybody is dead, Dave!

20:42.320 --> 20:46.711
Wait. Are you trying to tell me everybody's dead?

20:48.720 --> 20:50.711
I wish I'd never let him out,

20:50.880 --> 20:54.509
- How?
- The drive plate was badly repaired,

20:54.600 --> 20:58.752
It blew, and the crew was subjected
to a lethal dose of cadmium 2

20:58.840 --> 21:00.478
before I could seal the area,

21:00.560 --> 21:04.917
Oh, terri ble. Why's it so di rty here, Hol?
What is this stuff?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.594
That is Catering Officer Olaf Petersen,

21:07.680 --> 21:11.434
Aaaah! I've been eating half the crew!

21:12.400 --> 21:14.914
- Who's that?
- That's Captain Hollister,

21:15.080 --> 21:18.152
- And that's Todhunter,
- No, Second Technician Rimmer.

21:18.320 --> 21:22.108
Oh, yeah? I didn't recognise him
without his report book.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.556
Why was Rimmer in the Drive Room?

21:24.720 --> 21:28.395
He was explaining why he hadn't
sealed the drive plate properly,

21:28.560 --> 21:32.439
So wait on. How long was I in stasis?

21:32.520 --> 21:36.274
I couldn't release you
until the radiation reached a safe level,

21:36.360 --> 21:39.079
- How long?
- Three million years,

21:39.240 --> 21:41.356
Three million years!

21:42.440 --> 21:44.670
I've still got that library book.

21:46.120 --> 21:48.918
What about Krissie?
Krissie Kochanski?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.639
- She's dead, Dave,
- Aw, hey!

21:51.800 --> 21:56.669
It's no consolation, but if she were still alive,
the age difference would be insurmountable,

21:56.880 --> 21:59.633
She was part of me plan.

21:59.720 --> 22:03.235
I never told her, but she was
going to come with me to Fiji.

22:03.320 --> 22:06.073
She was to wear a white dress
and ride the horses.

22:06.160 --> 22:10.073
I was going to take care of everything else.
I planned it.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.800
She won't be much use to you on Fiji now...

22:12.880 --> 22:15.792
unless it snows and you need to grit the path,

22:19.240 --> 22:22.471
- Holly!
- Sorry, I'm sorry about that,

22:22.560 --> 22:26.155
I've been on me own
for three million years, I say what I think,

22:26.320 --> 22:28.959
I've gone a bit peculiar, to tell the truth,

22:29.280 --> 22:32.033
So everyone's dead? I'm on me own? Just me?

22:32.120 --> 22:35.669
- Technically speaking, yes,
- What do you mean, "technically"?

22:38.360 --> 22:41.238
Hello, Lister. Long time no see.

22:41.400 --> 22:44.676
- Rimmer, you're a hologram!
- Yes. That's because I'm dead.

22:44.760 --> 22:48.275
Dead as a can of Spam.
And it's all thanks to you.

22:48.360 --> 22:52.069
- Me? What did I do?
- If you hadn't kept that stupid cat,

22:52.160 --> 22:56.278
and been sent to stasis, I would have had
help with the repairs and I wouldn't be dead.

22:56.360 --> 22:59.272
- What does it feel like?
- Death?

22:59.360 --> 23:02.238
It's like being on holiday
with a group of Germans.

23:02.640 --> 23:05.313
No, I mean being a hologram.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.950
Do you mind? Being a hologram is fine, Lister.

23:10.040 --> 23:13.237
I still have the same drives,
the same feelings, emotions,

23:13.320 --> 23:15.788
but I can't touch anything.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.872
Never again will I be able
to brush a rose against my cheek,

23:18.960 --> 23:21.349
cradle a laughing child,

23:21.440 --> 23:23.908
or interfere with a woman sexually.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.119
Rimmer, you never did those things anyway!

23:27.240 --> 23:30.232
- I would have one day, murderer.
- Hey, I didn't do anything!

23:30.320 --> 23:33.471
It was YOU who didn't fix
the drive plates properly.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.756
- Is this me here?
- Yeah.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.513
Rimmer, look on the bright side.

23:38.600 --> 23:41.273
The bright side? What bright side?

23:41.360 --> 23:44.079
I'm dead. I'm composed entirely of light,

23:44.160 --> 23:48.597
and I'm alone with a man who'd lose
a battle of wits with a stuffed iguana!

23:48.800 --> 23:50.870
What's an iguana?

23:50.960 --> 23:53.838
Look, look, you're not dead, are ya?

23:53.920 --> 23:57.629
You're dead! But not "dead" dead,
'cause you're still here!

23:57.720 --> 24:01.429
Lister, I'm not really here!
I'm not really me! Don't you see?

24:01.520 --> 24:03.750
I'm a computer simulation of me.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.435
That's me, there,
a pile of albino mouse droppings.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.670
Come on. Lots of people have died.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.832
Lots have died and gone on
and done really, really well.

24:12.920 --> 24:15.195
You're a hologram. So what?

24:15.360 --> 24:18.955
I suppose you're right, Lister.
I've got to pull myself together.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.396
But you've got to help me.
Be my hands and my touch.

24:22.480 --> 24:25.597
I know what you like to touch.
No way, Rimmer. Forget it.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.637
Are you smoking? In the Drive Room?

24:28.800 --> 24:32.190
Yeah. I stopped for a while,
but I'm back on them now.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.471
You're on report, squire.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.393
I can't write it down. I'll remember it.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.229
Ohhh! Rimmer, I know it's wrong
to speak ill of the dead and all

24:45.320 --> 24:48.153
- but you're still a smeghead.
- I beg your pardon?

24:48.240 --> 24:50.231
I said, you're still a smeghead.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.311
Do you have any conception of the penalty

24:52.400 --> 24:55.392
for calling a deceased
superior technician a smeghead?

25:07.520 --> 25:12.548
- Lister, listen to me. Just listen.
- Just shut up. Shut up.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.752
Aaahhh! Aow! Eeee!

25:22.840 --> 25:25.673
Aow, eee, how am I looking?

25:28.440 --> 25:32.069
Looking nice. No, wait a minute.

25:32.160 --> 25:35.311
I'm looking better than nice.
I'm looking dangerous.

25:35.400 --> 25:40.155
Aaaoooww. Dangerous! Aaaooowww!
Hey, what's that?

25:41.640 --> 25:45.553
Oh, it's my shadow.
Hey, even my shadow's looking nice.

25:45.640 --> 25:49.474
I'm looking nice. My shadow's
looking nice. What a team!

25:49.560 --> 25:53.109
We are unbelievable! OK, team, this way.

25:53.840 --> 25:57.230
No, this way. Aaaoowww...

25:57.320 --> 26:01.199
Aaaoowww, yeah. This way!

26:01.800 --> 26:03.836
Lister, hold on, listen to me...

26:04.120 --> 26:06.793
Aaaooowww!

26:08.560 --> 26:12.678
Uh, oh! Better make myself look big!

26:16.320 --> 26:19.835
Hee hee! Fearsome. I was fearsome!

26:19.920 --> 26:23.515
# Just me and my shadow, ooohhh! #

26:23.600 --> 26:25.875
Come on, boy! # Walking down the... #

26:27.600 --> 26:32.674
Aaahhh! Holly, what was that?

26:33.440 --> 26:36.159
During the radioactive crisis,
your cat and her kittens

26:36.240 --> 26:38.196
were safely sealed in the hold,

26:38.280 --> 26:40.111
breeding for three million years,

26:40.200 --> 26:44.876
- and evolved into what you just saw,
- I don't get it.

26:45.360 --> 26:48.318
- You know man evolved from apes?
- Yeah, I know that.

26:48.480 --> 26:51.517
He evolved from cats, His ancestors were cats,

26:51.600 --> 26:54.478
He descended from cats, He is a cat,

26:54.840 --> 26:58.549
Aaahhh, ooohhh, yeah...

26:59.080 --> 27:01.878
Hello... Cat?

27:02.080 --> 27:04.913
Whoa! Crease!

27:07.640 --> 27:10.837
Stand back, Lister.

27:17.560 --> 27:20.279
- Here you go, Cat.
- Ah, crispies!

27:20.360 --> 27:22.635
- Holly says you like these.
- Mmmm!

27:22.880 --> 27:25.189
Hey! You monkeys eat off the floor?

27:25.280 --> 27:28.556
Ain't you got no style or sophistication?

27:28.640 --> 27:30.915
I'm sorry, Cat. I'm sorry.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.311
You people are unbelievable.

27:36.760 --> 27:40.878
- Where are your catty friends?
- Good crispies, man!

27:40.960 --> 27:44.157
Where are your kitties? Are they gone?
Are they dead? Have they left?

27:44.320 --> 27:46.788
Who cares? I want it off the ship!

27:46.880 --> 27:50.111
No! He's coming home with us, aren't you, Cat?

27:50.200 --> 27:52.589
Home? And where is that?

27:52.760 --> 27:55.718
- Earth.
- Who says there'll be an Earth?

27:55.800 --> 27:58.360
Look what it's done to a pet
in three million years.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.715
What has humankind evolved into?

28:00.880 --> 28:04.589
To them, you'll be like the slime
that first crawled out the oceans.

28:04.760 --> 28:07.638
- I could smarten meself up.
- Nah, you're a dinosaur.

28:07.720 --> 28:11.315
- You're extinct, nothing.
- Hey! I've still got me plan.

28:11.400 --> 28:15.279
And I've still got a cat.
Not Frankenstein, but still a cat.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.311
- Did you say Frankenstein?
- Yeah.

28:17.400 --> 28:20.472
She was your great, great, great,
great, great, grandmother.

28:20.560 --> 28:24.519
The Holy Mother? The Virgin Birth?
No one believes that stuff.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.114
The Virgin Birth?!

28:27.200 --> 28:29.794
No, it was a big black tom on Titan.

28:29.960 --> 28:33.316
Frankenstein, yeah! I remember
that stuff from kitty school.

28:33.400 --> 28:37.279
The Holy Mother, saved by Cloister the Stupid,

28:37.360 --> 28:39.396
who was frozen in time,

28:39.480 --> 28:41.675
and gaveth his life that we might live.

28:41.760 --> 28:46.117
No! No, it's not Cloister, it's me, it's Lister!

28:46.200 --> 28:48.555
It's Lister the... stupid?!

28:49.720 --> 28:54.111
Who shall returneth to lead us
to Fuchal, the Promised Land.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.919
No, it's not Fuchal, it's Fiji!

28:57.000 --> 28:58.991
I will! I'll lead you there.

28:59.080 --> 29:03.551
That's where we're going.
Holly, plot a course for Fiji.

Look out, Earth. The slime's coming home!

29:11.880 --> 29:15.668
# It's cold outside,
There's no kind of atmosphere

29:15.760 --> 29:18.991
# I'm all alone, more or less

29:19.080 --> 29:22.152
# Let me fly far away from here

29:22.240 --> 29:25.391
# Fun, fun, fun

29:25.480 --> 29:28.790
# In the sun, sun, sun

29:28.880 --> 29:32.395
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

29:32.480 --> 29:35.517
# Drinking fresh mango juice

29:35.600 --> 29:38.990
# Goldfish shoals, nipping at my toes

29:39.080 --> 29:41.071
# Fun, fun, fun

29:41.560 --> 29:45.439
# In the sun, sun, sun

29:45.520 --> 29:48.512
# Fun, fun, fun

29:48.600 --> 29:52.195
# In the sun, sun, sun #

29:53.305 --> 29:59.705
