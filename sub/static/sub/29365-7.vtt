[insects chirping]

00:07.799 --> 00:09.926
You know a divorce means it's over, right?

00:10.010 --> 00:12.345
-[Colt sighs]
-There's no coming back from that.

00:14.055 --> 00:17.434
Apparently, what there's no coming back
from, is me lying about selling cattle.

00:17.517 --> 00:18.685
Are you kidding me?

00:19.436 --> 00:22.522
You know that it's more than that.
It's about me trusting you.

00:22.856 --> 00:26.026
Oh my God! I just can't...
I can't talk about this anymore.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.487
It's like a...
like a shitty amusement park ride.

00:29.904 --> 00:33.324
It just won't end.
It just keeps going round and round.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.576
I just want it to stop!

00:34.951 --> 00:37.328
So I can get off and get my picture

00:37.412 --> 00:38.830
and eat my fucking churro.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.540
That's great.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.251
I'm trying to save our marriage
and you're making jokes.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.587
[shouts] I don't know what else to do!

00:45.879 --> 00:47.047
You don't trust me!

00:47.255 --> 00:49.674
You never will. Why the fuck you wanna
be married to me?

00:49.841 --> 00:51.801
Here we go again! When things get hard,

00:51.885 --> 00:54.512
you just blame someone else, huh,
and run away.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.139
-Oh-- I run away?
-Yeah!

00:56.222 --> 00:57.599
[shouts] You took Peyton...

00:58.975 --> 01:00.101
Why am I doing this?

01:00.518 --> 01:02.437
Look, think what you wanna think.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.147
-[dog barking]
-I'm done.

01:04.481 --> 01:05.815
I just want it to be over.

Has there ever been

02:23.643 --> 02:25.770
than Luigi from Super Mario Brothers?

02:27.063 --> 02:28.731
-What?
-Well, this son of a bitch,

02:28.815 --> 02:31.401
he's jumping over turtles,
he's falling down tubes,

02:31.526 --> 02:33.820
battling Bowser.
At the end of the day,

02:33.903 --> 02:36.239
it's always Mario that gets
to plough Princess Peach.

02:37.782 --> 02:38.616
Luigi?

02:39.033 --> 02:40.577
All he gets to ride is Yoshi.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.998
Deep down, I ain't so sure

02:45.081 --> 02:47.333
that Princess Peach
even wants to be with Mario.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.334
[cow moos]

02:48.459 --> 02:50.170
I mean, he's a plumber.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.881
All he's ever gonna be is a plumber.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.341
Yeah, she liked him back in high school,

02:55.425 --> 02:57.594
when he won
three state plumbing championships.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.012
Now, he makes one mistake,

02:59.095 --> 03:01.598
she just moves into her own apartment
with his kid.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.685
She expects him to be Super Mario
all the time, but he's just a man.

03:08.104 --> 03:11.065
Hey, bud, are you okay?
You wanna talk about something?

03:11.149 --> 03:12.859
No! No talkin'.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.569
Never no more talkin'.

03:16.070 --> 03:20.033
Just hypothetically,
if Mario and Peach ever call it quits,

03:20.116 --> 03:23.494
he'd be fine with Luigi getting in there
and laying some pipe. Yeah?

03:24.412 --> 03:27.248
-No. Mario would not be fine with that.
-[car approaches]

03:28.541 --> 03:30.001
Oh, shit. Here we go.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.253
[Colt] I got this, we'll be fine.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.088
Stick to the story.
[clears throat]

03:35.590 --> 03:36.633
Hey, Pong.

03:36.716 --> 03:37.884
Hey, boy!

03:38.301 --> 03:39.844
What you been up to, pal?

03:40.303 --> 03:41.554
Hey, Colt.
[clears throat]

03:41.804 --> 03:44.390
I was training to be a hostage negotiator.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.684
Unfortunately, unlike football,

03:46.768 --> 03:49.562
you start out 0-2,
they bench you real quick.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.273
What ya doin' round these parts?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.901
-Come to get this back?
-[Luke and Colt laugh]

03:55.777 --> 03:56.903
[Pong] Dammit, Colt!

03:57.237 --> 03:58.905
Do you know anything
about the dam explosion

03:58.988 --> 04:00.490
on the Stockwell Ranch last night?

04:00.573 --> 04:03.284
Lisa Neumann's pretty sure
you had something to do with it.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.787
[laughs] No. No way, I...

04:05.995 --> 04:09.040
We heard about it,
but I was at my dad's wedding all night.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.377
The only thing I blew up
was the dance floor.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.462
Yeah, Pong, you shoulda saw it.

04:14.545 --> 04:15.880
Show him some of your floss.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.215
-Let's take a look.
-No. He--

04:17.298 --> 04:18.132
He's gonna love it.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.133
Yeah? Alright.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.095
[Luke] Huh?

04:22.595 --> 04:24.389
[unenthusiastic] Great! Damn!

04:25.265 --> 04:26.432
It's better with music.

04:28.393 --> 04:32.272
Okay, so everybody at the weddin' knows
you were here all night?

04:32.814 --> 04:33.648
Yeah.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.817
Well, I mean.. It was not all night.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.027
At one point,
everyone took off to the bar.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.946
I just stayed back here with Ab.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.283
Mm-hmm. You think Ab would
make a statement?

04:43.366 --> 04:46.869
They won't let me do the interview,
you know, 'cause we're all friends.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.789
Even though no one's RSVP'd
to my birthday.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.667
I need to know
so we have even teams for laser tag.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.461
Look, Beer Pong,

04:55.962 --> 04:58.881
no one wants to go
'cause your dad takes it too seriously.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.218
Yeah, I'm...

05:02.927 --> 05:04.929
I'm sure Ab would be fine
giving a statement.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.725
And for the record, after the bar,
I was in my cabin watching Frozen.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.144
You're not a suspect.

05:11.769 --> 05:13.730
I wish I hadn't volunteered that then.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.900
[Beau] Hey, Billy.
What you doin' out here?

05:17.984 --> 05:22.363
Hey, Mr. Bennett. I'm sure you heard
that someone blew up Lisa Neumann's dam.

05:23.114 --> 05:23.948
Really?

05:24.532 --> 05:25.658
I hadn't heard that.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.785
Hey, I gotta get goin'.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.787
Congratulations on the wedding,
Mr. Bennett.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.831
I didn't get you a gift
but if you want,

05:31.914 --> 05:34.542
I can let you supermarket sweep
the evidence locker.

05:36.294 --> 05:39.172
Thanks, Billy.
I got all the unregistered guns I need.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.757
You can't tell me that!

05:43.968 --> 05:46.679
I'm new to this game.
When do we give this back to him?

05:46.763 --> 05:48.806
Oh, Jesus! [laughs]

05:49.223 --> 05:50.475
What the fuck did you do?

05:51.809 --> 05:53.936
I did what I had to do
to protect my ranch.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.064
Like you said you did back in the day.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.192
Jesus Christ, Colt!
That was a long time ago.

05:59.650 --> 06:02.195
If you went to the doctor, with a cough,

06:02.445 --> 06:05.239
he'd recommend you switch
to Marlboro Lights.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.575
It's bullshit.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.620
Peterson put up a deer stand
on your property,

06:10.703 --> 06:13.414
you tore it down
'cause you knew he was in the wrong.

06:13.498 --> 06:17.043
That was two old men bickering
over a fucking pile of wood.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.505
You took down a dam that belongs
to a giant corporation.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.507
They could put you in fucking jail!

06:24.050 --> 06:26.844
Uncle Beau, we're just...
trying to save the ranch.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.471
Oh, you're part of this, too?

06:28.554 --> 06:31.224
Absolutely not. I was in my cabin
watching Frozen.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.269
Lisa Neumann ain't playing fair,
so why should we?

06:35.353 --> 06:36.938
[shouts] 'Cause we're better than that.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.441
We been ranchin' this fuckin' land
for generations.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.486
And we always did things
in an honorable way.

06:44.737 --> 06:45.571
Until now.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.616
[birds squawking]

06:56.332 --> 06:58.084
-Hey.
-Hey, Colt.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.839
-I ran into Bob Kincaid earlier.
-Oh, yeah?

07:03.506 --> 07:04.715
The cops stopped by

07:04.799 --> 07:07.385
and questioned him and his family
about the dam.

07:07.468 --> 07:08.302
[Colt] Hmm.

07:08.886 --> 07:12.640
They oughta question Bob Kincaid on how
he gets his eyelashes to be so full.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.851
When that guy blinks,
looks like he's waving.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.688
I wish you'd have come to me first.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.524
We coulda figured out another solution.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.735
Coulda raised your cows at Iron River.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.738
[chuckles] 'Cause Lisa Neumann
would really go for that.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.032
Got a better shot at starting
for the Broncos next year.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.077
We don't know what Lisa woulda said.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.329
You didn't give us a chance to ask.

07:35.913 --> 07:39.250
Instead, you just... went off
and did whatever the fuck you want,

07:39.417 --> 07:40.543
without thinkin'.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.336
[grunts] The dam's down,

07:42.753 --> 07:44.755
water's flowin', cows are drinkin'.

07:45.047 --> 07:48.676
I finally get why people say
that you don't need alcohol to be happy.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.386
Want a beer?

07:53.598 --> 07:54.599
-Hey!
-Hey.

07:54.682 --> 07:55.766
Let me help you with that.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.019
Thanks. I'm glad you're helpful.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.103
Safeway isn't.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.898
They've gone to self-checkout.

08:02.231 --> 08:04.275
Got so tired of scanning this stuff,

08:04.358 --> 08:06.235
-I didn't even pay for half of it.
-[Colt] Shit.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.571
I don't know the produce code
for fucking cantaloupe.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.073
6551342791.

08:13.034 --> 08:13.868
I used to work there.

08:13.951 --> 08:14.785
[Joanne chuckles]

08:16.120 --> 08:17.997
D'you pick up
that Muscle Milk I asked you for?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.041
You didn't ask me to get Muscle Milk.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.876
Yeah, I did. I put it on the list.

08:22.126 --> 08:25.755
I remember 'cause right next to it, I drew
a picture of a little cow with biceps

08:25.838 --> 08:27.590
and a speech bubble saying,
"I'm beefin' up."

08:29.008 --> 08:29.884
[Beau] Does it matter?

08:30.718 --> 08:32.345
You been drinkin' that shit for years.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.805
They oughta call it
Skinny-Ass Arms Milk.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.892
I didn't forget your stupid milk

08:37.975 --> 08:40.102
because you didn't put it
on the damn list.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.772
I'll pick some up at Walmart.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.273
I like getting it there, anyway.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.651
There's this ole gal
on the checkout station,

08:46.734 --> 08:48.778
she always says,
[high voice] "You don't need this."

08:48.861 --> 08:51.322
[laughs] And I say, "Well, feel free
to rollback the prices

08:51.405 --> 08:53.866
but do not rollback the compliments."

08:54.450 --> 08:55.743
It's kind of our thing.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.412
I woulda known if it was on the list

08:58.496 --> 09:00.456
'cause you wouldna been able
to spell "milk."

09:00.623 --> 09:02.291
-Joanne, it's okay.
-No, it's not!

09:02.375 --> 09:04.669
He's accusing me of something
I didn't even do!

09:04.752 --> 09:07.713
If one of us screws up here,
who do you think it's gonna be?

09:09.131 --> 09:10.258
Musta been my mistake.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.593
And I don't need
your goddamn condescension.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.594
Look it up.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.348
-Joanne, wait.
-Leave me the fuck alone!

09:19.976 --> 09:22.645
-She okay?
-She look like she's doing okay to you?

09:26.357 --> 09:27.191
[Colt sighs]

09:29.360 --> 09:32.572
Lookee there. I got a brand new thing
of Muscle Milk right here.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.119
[door knocks]

09:46.586 --> 09:47.628
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.297
I'll get Peyton's things.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.510
[Peyton coos]

09:54.844 --> 09:55.678
Hey.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.765
Oh.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.811
You framed the photo
of the day Peyton was born, huh?

10:04.145 --> 10:04.979
Yeah.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.480
Now that she's real cute,

10:06.564 --> 10:09.150
we can both admit
that she came out super ugly, huh?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.279
Look, I'm not really in the mood
for small talk, okay?

10:13.362 --> 10:16.407
Here's all her bottles for the day,
extra clothes, I'll pick her up tonight.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.785
Also, she has a teething toy
that looks like car keys.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.872
So don't try and start your car with them,
like I did.

10:24.540 --> 10:28.169
Yeah. Can I talk to you about something?

10:28.336 --> 10:30.463
Yeah, I saw your flossing video
on Facebook.

10:30.546 --> 10:31.464
I'm not 'liking' it.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.342
No, it's...

10:35.426 --> 10:38.429
Police have been poking around
about that Neumann's Hill dam.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.307
They're probably
gonna come talk to you.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.809
Just tell 'em I was with you
the whole night.

10:45.978 --> 10:46.812
Wow.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.690
I thought you'd had second thoughts
about a divorce,

10:49.774 --> 10:51.901
but you want me to lie
to the cops for you.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.987
I just need your help with this.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.072
[Peyton gurgles]

10:56.530 --> 10:58.449
People lie to the cops all the time.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.117
"I was driving the speed limit, officer."

11:00.201 --> 11:01.535
"Only had two drinks, officer."

11:01.619 --> 11:03.496
"I didn't know it was your wife, officer."

11:04.664 --> 11:06.165
This... to a friend of mine.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.627
I'm not gonna be your accomplice.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.380
The dam's down.
I already "accompliced" it.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.091
I need your help as an alibi.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.968
If the cops wanna talk to me,
I'm not gonna lie for you.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.224
If... I get caught for this,
I'm going to jail.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.518
You shoulda thought of that
before you removed the dam.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.353
[Peyton starts crying]

11:32.733 --> 11:34.735
[sighs]

11:35.111 --> 11:36.862
[sighs] Sorry, Bambi.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.573
It's just weird
when I'm walking around naked.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.784
I can't have you checking out my Thumper.

11:44.745 --> 11:45.913
What the heck?

11:51.627 --> 11:54.338
"Rooster's emergency zombie kit"?

11:56.757 --> 11:57.800
Mm-hmm.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.137
Ah... Huh.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.264
Well, that's the exact same as

12:03.347 --> 12:05.975
Rooster's emergency
Hillary Clinton gets elected kit.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.645
-[door knocks]
-Yeah?

12:11.188 --> 12:12.022
[Mary] Hey.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.401
What are you doin' here?

12:15.985 --> 12:16.819
I need help.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.530
You need help? Hmm.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.407
I've heard that one before.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.661
Y'know, a lot of people called me stupid
for trusting you again.

12:26.036 --> 12:29.415
But when Colt calls you stupid,
that's a fucking wake-up call.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.000
I'm not doin' it again.

12:31.876 --> 12:35.546
[sighs] Okay, look. I wanna go to rehab
in Grand Junction.

12:36.130 --> 12:36.964
And...

12:38.174 --> 12:40.718
Look, all I'm asking for is a ride. Okay?

12:40.926 --> 12:43.512
If I try to take myself there,
I will never make it.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.182
I mean...

12:46.807 --> 12:50.019
I wish I believed that a ride was
all you wanted, but I don't.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.318
[sighs]

12:57.777 --> 12:59.069
I did heroin last night.

13:02.072 --> 13:02.907
[sighs]

13:03.949 --> 13:04.784
I know.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.452
So stupid.

13:08.120 --> 13:08.996
[sighs]

13:09.663 --> 13:10.831
The worst part is...

13:11.874 --> 13:14.627
it was so fucking good.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.213
I mean, it was like...

13:17.963 --> 13:21.425
the best pizza after the best sex

13:21.509 --> 13:25.095
in the most comfortable bed
you have ever had.

13:25.971 --> 13:26.806
Really?

13:29.350 --> 13:31.143
Man, I like all those things.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.189
No, just say no. Okay.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.859
Fine. I will give you a ride.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.653
Okay? But under one condition.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.531
We walk outta here,
get in that truck now and leave.

13:43.614 --> 13:46.659
We're not going back to yours,
you're not packing. We go.

13:46.742 --> 13:47.618
[Mary] Thank you.

13:47.868 --> 13:48.702
[Luke] Okay.

13:49.245 --> 13:54.041
[sniffs] Oh. You found Rooster's
emergency North Korean invasion kit.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.085
Ah.

13:56.627 --> 13:57.628
[cow mooing]

13:59.672 --> 14:00.881
All right, Dale. Thanks.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.509
Actually, she just walked in.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.011
She'll appreciate you sayin' that.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.513
Right.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.682
Alright, Dale, stop talkin'.

14:11.058 --> 14:11.892
Dale.

14:13.102 --> 14:13.936
Dale.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.188
Dale!

14:18.732 --> 14:19.608
That was Dale.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.990
-You're okay?
-Yeah.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.075
-I'm sorry.
-Hey.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.499
I just needed to be alone.

14:37.626 --> 14:38.669
I went to church.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.423
Didn't know whether to pray to God
or curse Him.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.968
I felt the same way
when a Donald became president.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.219
[Joanne chuckles]

14:47.845 --> 14:50.639
Then, all of a sudden, I sat down
at the organ and started to play.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.475
My mom made me have lessons
when I was a kid.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.395
How is it that I remember all the songs,

14:56.604 --> 14:59.106
but I can't remember
Colt's stupid Muscle Milk?

14:59.690 --> 15:02.985
He was right. It was on the list
and he spelled "milk" correctly.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.904
"Muscle" was a disaster.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.574
-Guess he can't spell it or grow it.
-[laughs]

15:11.327 --> 15:12.244
Listen.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.164
We all forget things.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.584
It's no big deal.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.295
Exactly. It's no big deal
but I tore Colt's head off.

15:21.545 --> 15:24.423
The kid was born with a face
that's easy to yell at.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.927
It was like I...
became a different person.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.762
I... I didn't have any control.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.515
And the one thing that's always been
constant, is my mind.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.476
Some days, I feel smart.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.686
Some days, I don't.
Some days, I feel strong.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.521
Some days, I don't,
but I always feel like me,

15:39.605 --> 15:41.774
and to know that, someday, I'm...

15:42.107 --> 15:43.317
I'm not gonna be...

15:43.400 --> 15:45.653
The doctor said there could be
mood swings.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.489
Times when you didn't feel like yourself.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.574
My grandmother had this disease.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.285
We used to go visit her,

15:53.702 --> 15:56.872
and she'd get scared,
and she'd scream at us to get out.

15:57.539 --> 15:59.083
She had no idea who we were.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.587
She thought we'd broken into her room
or were trying to kill her.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.714
-Jesus.
-It was just awful.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.092
I don't want that to happen.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.886
I want to go out on my own terms.

16:11.845 --> 16:12.721
What do you mean?

16:14.264 --> 16:17.893
When the time comes when there's more
of that other person than there is of me,

16:18.727 --> 16:20.771
I want you to help me end the suffering.

16:20.854 --> 16:23.565
Jesus, Joanne!
Let's not even talk about that.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.651
I'm only gonna get worse and worse
until I'm gone.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.069
Well, I'm not gonna do it!

16:27.861 --> 16:31.198
I promised to take care of you
in sickness and in health.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.158
But this would be taking care of me.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.537
You of all people should understand that.
What if the roles were reversed?

16:36.620 --> 16:39.081
Remember the time you went
to the dentist for a check-up,

16:39.164 --> 16:41.583
and you told me if anything goes south,
to pull the plug?

16:41.667 --> 16:42.501
Stop!

16:43.752 --> 16:44.920
We're done talkin' about this.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.556
[quietly] You like it?

16:55.639 --> 16:58.017
Oh, yeah. You like the bug light,
don't you?

16:58.100 --> 16:59.727
-[Peyton gurgles]
-It's pretty, isn't it?

16:59.977 --> 17:01.061
It also zaps 'em.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.773
Aye! Woah!

17:05.024 --> 17:05.858
Okay!

17:06.150 --> 17:07.234
That's a no-touch.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.611
That's why Daddy did that,
so now you know.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.571
[car approaching]

17:13.282 --> 17:14.116
[Colt] Hey.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.244
Hey!

17:17.578 --> 17:19.079
Janice, I err...

17:19.663 --> 17:20.664
thought Abby was comin'.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.459
She's running errands,
so I'm here to pick up Peyton.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.754
-[Peyton gurgles]
-Hi there, sweetheart! Oh.

17:27.463 --> 17:31.175
Looks like Daddy took time
to do his hair but not yours.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.095
I... I really need to talk to her.

17:35.512 --> 17:36.638
About the divorce?

17:38.474 --> 17:40.517
Ah. She told you about that.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.020
[inhales] Colt...

17:43.687 --> 17:46.440
I don't know how to put this,
so I'm just gonna say it.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.692
What the fuck are you thinkin'?

17:49.568 --> 17:50.402
Ha.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.154
Maybe I do know how to put it.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.533
Look, Janice,
I appreciate you weighin' in here.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.204
It's kinda complicated.
There's things you don't understand.

18:00.871 --> 18:01.705
Really?

18:01.914 --> 18:05.125
'Cause you been married a few months,
I've been married 40 years.

18:05.709 --> 18:06.960
Great, no offense, but,

18:07.086 --> 18:09.713
it's not like you and Chuck
are that happily married.

18:10.130 --> 18:13.884
Your Christmas stockings say
"Janice," "Abby," and "Asshole."

18:15.010 --> 18:16.553
That is an inside joke

18:17.137 --> 18:18.722
because he is such an asshole.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.059
Chuck and I love each other.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.687
When I get good news,
he's the one I share it with.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.397
And when I get bad news,

18:27.481 --> 18:29.399
he's the shoulder I cry on.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.069
He's my best friend.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.072
And I wouldn't wanna go a single day
without him.

18:35.989 --> 18:36.907
Or wine.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.577
I wouldn't wanna go a single day
without wine.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.125
I'm not sure Abby loves me
as much as you love wine.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.586
Hell, I'm not sure I love Peyton
as much as you love wine.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.132
Abby still cares.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.135
Even when she was talking
about the divorce,

18:56.218 --> 18:58.011
she said how much she loves you.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.182
And when she texts her friends,
she says the same thing.

19:04.184 --> 19:06.728
-Why you reading her texts?
-That's not important.

19:08.647 --> 19:12.484
Two months ago, you ran into a fire
because you were so scared of losing her.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.487
If you walk away right now,
you'll lose her forever.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.115
[Peyton gurgles]

19:19.074 --> 19:20.659
Know when she'll be done runnin' errands?

19:22.661 --> 19:23.537
[Janice] Well...

19:23.912 --> 19:27.958
let's just take a little look-see
on Find My iPhone.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.586
D'you spy on her all the time?

19:30.669 --> 19:34.006
No. That's what she gets for staying
on the family cell phone plan.

19:34.131 --> 19:34.965
[Colt] Oh...

19:35.257 --> 19:36.091
Yeah.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.676
I'd be on my dad's,

19:37.759 --> 19:40.596
but he's only got five minutes' talk,
no data, no text,

19:40.679 --> 19:41.513
so...

19:42.222 --> 19:44.850
Somehow, he manages
to get them minutes to roll over.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.103
She's nowhere near the Walgreens.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.105
She's at the police station.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.440
That's not good.

20:04.536 --> 20:05.537
How you holdin' up?

20:06.246 --> 20:07.080
Not great.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.084
Remember when I said
heroin is like the best pizza,

20:11.168 --> 20:12.920
after the best sex in the best bed?

20:13.378 --> 20:15.130
Well, withdrawal's like eating a...

20:15.255 --> 20:19.009
a Cicis pizza
after fucking your cousin in a dumpster.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.095
Disgusting.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.014
I'd never eat Cicis pizza.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.974
Ha! [inhales sharply]

20:27.768 --> 20:30.187
You know, I'm...
I'm proud of you for doing this.

20:32.356 --> 20:35.943
I've been avoiding going to
those PTSD meetings for years.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.570
It's kind of inspiring.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.073
Like that last scene of Rudy.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.867
If all of his teammates
were carrying him off to rehab.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.120
[Mary sighs]

20:47.829 --> 20:49.706
Maybe I'll meet somebody cool there.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.291
I heard that...

20:51.833 --> 20:53.585
that Channel 32 weatherman,

20:53.669 --> 20:55.754
-he's in and outta rehab.
-No!

20:56.463 --> 20:58.173
-Gus T. Winds?
-[Mary chuckles]

21:00.050 --> 21:01.134
Thanks for taking me.

21:01.885 --> 21:02.761
[Luke] Course.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.596
I think you'll look back on this

21:04.680 --> 21:06.682
as the day your whole life
turned around.

21:08.141 --> 21:11.103
And when you get out,
I'll be right there to bring you home.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.314
Or, you know,
maybe you could take a shuttle.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.149
This is a lot farther
than I thought it was.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.567
[laughs]

21:18.819 --> 21:19.653
Shit.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.032
[sighs] You are a really good guy.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.410
-[Luke] Mm...
-Yeah.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.036
Way better than I deserve.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.373
Oh, God.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.750
Oh, I think I'm gonna puke.

21:34.501 --> 21:35.502
Oh, fuck.

21:35.585 --> 21:38.797
I appreciate the immediacy of your review,
if not the content.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.301
No, it's just... the withdrawal.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.052
Can you do me a favor? Can you...

21:44.386 --> 21:45.554
Can you get me a ginger ale?

21:45.637 --> 21:46.471
[Luke] Yeah.

21:48.140 --> 21:48.974
Err...

21:49.057 --> 21:51.351
You a Schweppes gal or Canada Dry?

21:53.812 --> 21:54.938
I just did heroin.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.733
I'm not, you know, real discerning
about my ginger ale.

21:58.692 --> 21:59.526
Hmm.

22:21.631 --> 22:22.466
[engine starts]

22:26.511 --> 22:27.346
[shouts] Mary!

22:34.686 --> 22:36.104
-Hey!
-Hey.

22:37.064 --> 22:38.106
What's this?

22:38.940 --> 22:41.276
I thought it might be nice
if we played a game.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.986
Ooh. You wanna play a game?

22:43.820 --> 22:46.448
Sure. And after,
we can go test-drive a Prius.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.366
[Beau laughs]

22:48.784 --> 22:50.369
Okay, I'll go first.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.662
Got any fours?

22:52.746 --> 22:53.580
Go fish.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.001
A trout.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.296
Trout is a freshwater fish.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.842
What the fuck would a trout be doin'
in the same water as a seahorse?

23:05.926 --> 23:06.802
[Joanne chuckles]

23:07.719 --> 23:09.096
This game makes no sense.

23:10.347 --> 23:12.224
I agree. What the hell are we doing?

23:14.101 --> 23:16.353
After our last conversation, I...

23:17.521 --> 23:19.731
wanted to learn more
about your condition.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.317
So I did some research.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.737
Got Dale to help me go on the Internet.

23:25.946 --> 23:26.905
Aw.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.865
You went on the Internet for me?

23:29.366 --> 23:31.785
Aren't you afraid
the Russians can track you now?

23:32.119 --> 23:33.078
Course I am.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.040
But it was worth it.
Although it wasn't easy.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.545
When I went to search Alzheimer's
and I typed A-L,

23:42.337 --> 23:45.006
the computer said, "Did you mean Al Gore?"

23:45.757 --> 23:47.426
No, I fucking did not.

23:49.511 --> 23:50.887
Anyway, I found an article

23:50.971 --> 23:53.515
that said you could help delay
some of the symptoms

23:53.598 --> 23:55.600
with games and puzzles.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.436
Oh, that's very sweet!

23:58.186 --> 23:59.646
But if you wanna play a card game,

23:59.729 --> 24:02.190
then we're gonna have to put money on it,
drink whiskey,

24:02.274 --> 24:04.609
and you better prepare
to get your ass kicked.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.569
[Beau chuckles]

24:05.944 --> 24:06.778
So...

24:08.196 --> 24:10.365
I thought a lot
about what you said earlier

24:10.574 --> 24:12.200
and I think I understand.

24:12.701 --> 24:13.702
You do?

24:13.785 --> 24:14.619
Yeah.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.080
You wanna go out on your own terms.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.291
I mean, shit, Elway did it.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.209
So, I gotta respect it.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.045
I bet Brett Favre wishes

24:24.129 --> 24:27.340
someone woulda taken him out
before he joined the Jets.

24:29.676 --> 24:30.760
I can't imagine...

24:32.929 --> 24:35.765
what it must feel like to know
part of you's slipping away.

24:39.227 --> 24:42.022
But I do understand
wantin' to go out with your dignity.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.358
And if that's what you want,

24:45.901 --> 24:47.569
I'll help you because I love you.

24:50.864 --> 24:51.698
Thank you.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.578
As hard as this is, it'd be
a million times harder without you.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.165
I do have one condition.

25:01.625 --> 25:05.337
If I get into a similar situation,
I expect you to do the same for me.

25:06.713 --> 25:08.298
-You wanna make a pact?
-Yeah.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.800
I can't trust Colt.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.428
He's never gonna pull the plug

25:13.512 --> 25:16.473
once he realizes I can't stop him
from huggin' me.

25:19.309 --> 25:20.227
We have a deal.

25:23.605 --> 25:24.439
Look at us.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.775
We been married two days.

25:28.401 --> 25:30.820
We already agreed to kill each other.
[laughs]

25:46.127 --> 25:47.963
-Thank you, Hank.
-Of course!

25:48.588 --> 25:52.509
And remember, five-star rating is
always appreciated.

25:53.468 --> 25:54.928
-Hey, Colt.
-Hey, Hank.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.389
I see you got your driver's license back.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.724
Huh? Err... Yeah, sure.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.940
Why was Hank giving you a ride home?

26:07.691 --> 26:08.650
Where's your truck?

26:09.734 --> 26:11.236
Err... Mary stole it.

26:12.362 --> 26:15.031
-Mm. Mm.
-[Colt] Jesus Christ!

26:15.365 --> 26:17.075
Come on, man, that's just sad.

26:17.951 --> 26:20.745
Look, take it from me.
If you're gonna be this dumb,

26:20.829 --> 26:23.290
you gotta work a lot harder
at being good lookin'.

26:23.957 --> 26:24.791
[scoffs]

26:25.333 --> 26:27.127
I mean, I shoulda seen it coming.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.671
I really thought
she wanted help this time.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.881
But, no, just another way
to screw me over.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.843
I already felt like shit,

26:35.010 --> 26:36.720
and then I gotta sit in Hank's car

26:36.845 --> 26:39.889
while he picks up two people
and takes them to the airport.

26:40.348 --> 26:41.182
Jesus!

26:42.892 --> 26:43.810
Oh, boy.

26:44.769 --> 26:45.645
Here comes Abby.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.022
[Luke] Mm-hmm.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.983
Did she speak to the police yet?

26:50.567 --> 26:52.277
[sighing] Well... yeah.

26:52.694 --> 26:55.196
-I think that's where she's coming from.
-Hmm.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.282
Apparently,
she gonna tell 'em the truth.

26:58.199 --> 26:59.909
What? Why would she do that?

26:59.993 --> 27:01.202
Let me just handle it.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.038
Hey, listen. Just in case,

27:03.121 --> 27:05.123
I'm gonna see if Hank
can Uber us up to Canada.

27:05.206 --> 27:07.751
We'll be safe there.
They got Tim Horton's poutine

27:07.834 --> 27:10.253
and all-nude strip clubs serving poutine.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.882
I mean, even if she covered for us,
we should take a trip to Canada.

27:18.595 --> 27:19.429
Hey, Luke.

27:19.512 --> 27:20.347
Hey, Abby.

27:20.722 --> 27:23.433
When you play Mario Kart,
you ever pick Luigi?

27:23.516 --> 27:24.351
Dude!

27:31.024 --> 27:32.233
Been tryin' to call you.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.320
I've been at the police station.

27:35.403 --> 27:36.655
Yeah, I know. Your mom...

27:39.032 --> 27:41.451
You should really change the code
on your phone.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.163
-So... err...
-[Abby clears throat]

27:46.581 --> 27:47.457
How'd that go?

27:49.918 --> 27:52.671
I told them that you were
with me the whole night, so...

27:55.256 --> 27:56.758
Jesus! Thank you.

27:57.634 --> 27:58.760
Thank you, so much.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.512
I... owe you.

28:00.845 --> 28:03.056
I... Listen, you know what?

28:03.556 --> 28:04.849
We're going to Olive Garden.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.893
And not just for the soup,

28:06.976 --> 28:08.645
-and salad, and the breadsticks.
-[chuckles]

28:09.062 --> 28:12.148
Bring your passport, 'cause you're gonna
take a Tour of Italy.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.151
You don't owe me anything.

28:16.903 --> 28:17.737
I, err...

28:19.114 --> 28:20.657
I do. Err...

28:21.700 --> 28:22.784
I talked to your mom.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.287
Maybe we should talk
about the other night.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.624
Yeah, I know.
I've been thinking about it, too.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.418
Like you said...

28:33.253 --> 28:35.672
we're never gonna fix this, so... Here.

28:37.924 --> 28:38.758
What's this?

28:39.175 --> 28:40.135
Divorce papers.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.764
Abby, hold on.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.016
You were right.
There's nothing more to talk about.

29:03.491 --> 29:04.576
Hey, Colt.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.079
Lisa.

29:09.664 --> 29:10.957
What you doin' here?

29:11.291 --> 29:13.209
We need to talk about my dam.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.962
I heard about that.

29:19.799 --> 29:21.634
I was at my dad's wedding all night.

29:21.718 --> 29:25.346
In fact, there's a video
on Facebook of me...

29:25.972 --> 29:27.807
busting moves on the dance floor.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.394
Look no further, America does got talent.

29:33.688 --> 29:36.483
Did you know that there is
an old wildlife camera

29:36.566 --> 29:38.026
on Jean Stockwell's property?

29:39.944 --> 29:41.237
-What?
-Yeah.

29:41.321 --> 29:44.949
Apparently they set it up a few years ago
to track mountain lions in the area.

29:45.033 --> 29:48.495
I didn't even know it was there.
Then one of my guys found it. It's...

29:51.498 --> 29:53.166
Okay. I see what you doin' here.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.127
Trying to get me to confess, huh?

29:57.253 --> 29:59.714
It ain't gonna work.
I've seen enough spy movies.

29:59.839 --> 30:01.174
Are you wearing a wire?

30:01.758 --> 30:03.384
[loudly] I didn't fuckin' do it.

30:05.094 --> 30:06.012
[Lisa] And here...

30:07.388 --> 30:09.307
is a still from the video.

30:10.517 --> 30:13.394
Time stamped just a couple of minutes
before the dam blew.

30:26.825 --> 30:27.659
[Colt] Okay.

30:29.786 --> 30:30.620
You got me.

30:33.581 --> 30:34.499
What you wanna do?

30:34.791 --> 30:36.835
[laughs] I like you, Colt. I really do.

30:37.418 --> 30:39.170
And I don't wanna send you to jail.

30:39.963 --> 30:41.589
So, I'm gonna give you a choice.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.218
Now, either I turn this into the police...

30:46.302 --> 30:47.762
or you sell me your ranch.
