00:03.680 --> 00:06.160
Chris, throughout this build

00:06.160 --> 00:11.520
you have been very calm, very
collected, no outbursts of emotion.

00:11.520 --> 00:16.000
I wonder if there's a maelstrom
underneath the surface.

00:16.280 --> 00:21.480
I think I've been pretty steady.
Confident we'd get through it

00:21.480 --> 00:27.280
< and confident if we hit
any problems we had the equity
to get out of it.

00:27.280 --> 00:32.600
< In terms of just the sheer volume
of work you've both had to do here,

00:32.600 --> 00:36.320
< it must have, at times,
got you really down.

00:36.320 --> 00:40.160
Sometimes it's been hard
to keep motivated,

00:40.160 --> 00:42.920
especially in the winter months,

00:42.920 --> 00:47.800
coming down here with three jumpers
and a coat on to do some work.

00:47.800 --> 00:51.879
You have to motivate yourself
to get out of bed.

00:51.879 --> 00:52.399
But we've enjoyed it, haven't we?

00:52.399 --> 00:55.279
Yeah,
and we knew it'd be worthwhile.

00:55.559 --> 00:59.519
'Their industrial look
was a brave design choice,

00:59.519 --> 01:04.919
motivated primarily by budget, but
also by a dream of spacious living.'

01:04.919 --> 01:09.639
'It wouldn't be my first choice,
on top of a windy hill up north,

01:09.639 --> 01:14.279
but Chris and Leanne love it,
and it cost them just #150,000.'

01:14.519 --> 01:16.639
'Have you had it valued?'

01:16.639 --> 01:21.799
< Not since we've completed, but
we had it valued not so long ago,

01:21.799 --> 01:26.199
and we were given a figure
in the region of #350-375.

01:26.199 --> 01:29.599
Which would be
a net profit of #200,000. >

01:29.599 --> 01:32.279
Not a bad return for a year's work. >

01:32.279 --> 01:34.279
It's OK.
Beats selling records, doesn't it?

01:34.279 --> 01:38.559
It does, doesn't it.

01:38.559 --> 01:43.039
in terms of pounds per square foot
spent here, incredibly cheap. >

01:43.319 --> 01:47.399
Was there no point
at which you said to yourselves,

01:47.399 --> 01:49.399
in doing this place up, >

01:49.399 --> 01:51.639
"This is just not worth it"?

01:51.919 --> 01:52.519
No.

01:52.519 --> 01:54.559
Oh no, absolutely not.

01:54.559 --> 01:59.439
We've had highs and lows but
not once have we had that thought.

01:59.439 --> 02:03.199
This is our dream house
and that motivates you.

02:03.479 --> 02:07.519
< It might sound cliched,
but it really does.

02:07.519 --> 02:12.439
< Plus we've invested everything
we've got and more into it.

02:13.759 --> 02:18.199
You've got to finish, haven't you?
That's part of it.

02:18.199 --> 02:20.919
Whatever it takes, we'll finish.

02:37.958 --> 02:41.718
This is the story
of two unlikely heroes

02:41.718 --> 02:46.358
and their rescue of a building
from the brink of oblivion,

02:46.358 --> 02:52.918
with little money, no professional
help and absolutely zero experience.

02:53.078 --> 02:56.718
despite all these incredible odds,

02:56.878 --> 03:01.478
through sheer determination really,
they've won the day.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.518
They've got exactly what they want.

03:05.638 --> 03:09.638
And I think
it's what the building deserves.

LORRAINE FORREST

03:54.198 --> 03:57.158
'Gas, leccy, insurance...' Oh.

03:57.158 --> 03:58.918
'Letter from Jane.'

03:58.918 --> 04:00.597
'I think I'll do these first.'

04:00.597 --> 04:02.237
0870...

04:02.237 --> 04:04.277
0845...

04:04.277 --> 04:07.117
'As if it wasn't bad enough having
to make these calls...' Quotes.

04:07.117 --> 04:09.237
..I have to PAY to make them!'

04:09.237 --> 04:11.077
Unlike with most companies

04:11.077 --> 04:15.237
calls to 0845 and 0870 numbers
are now free with BT. Free!

04:15.237 --> 04:16.797
Hi, Jane.

04:16.797 --> 04:19.237
Um, the answer's yes.

05:52.756 --> 05:55.756
Daria's assessment was atypical
chest pain, which I agree with.

05:55.916 --> 05:58.436
He's going home after two
normal troponins and EKGs.

05:58.556 --> 05:59.676
Not during rounds.

05:59.836 --> 06:02.076
And when he drops dead
in his own kitchen,

06:02.236 --> 06:04.436
it will be because
we missed a...?

06:04.556 --> 06:06.276
PE?
No.

06:06.436 --> 06:07.676
Symptoms are
too intermittent.

06:07.836 --> 06:09.356
Are you thinking
variant angina?

06:09.516 --> 06:10.956
He complained
of abdominal pain.

06:11.556 --> 06:13.036
Am I boring you, Dr Gates?

06:13.156 --> 06:15.476
No. I'm sorry.
It's a 6am shift.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.196
My brain's here,
but my body isn't.

06:17.356 --> 06:19.116
If there's pain above
and below the diaphragm,

06:19.196 --> 06:20.596
think aortic dissection.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.476
Get a CT.
That's a great
teaching point, Dr Banfield.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.636
If you can learn
something new
on every case,

06:24.796 --> 06:27.276
you'll be brilliant by the time
you finish your training.

06:27.436 --> 06:29.316
So, in order to get
to the next level,

06:29.436 --> 06:30.636
each intern will get a mentor.

06:30.796 --> 06:33.556
Gates, you get Wade.
Uh, Brenner, Martin.

06:33.556 --> 06:34.996
Morris, Sanchez.

06:36.316 --> 06:37.636
Mentors,

06:37.756 --> 06:39.316
as they go, so you go.

06:39.476 --> 06:41.036
Well, I guess Brenner's gone,

06:41.156 --> 06:42.716
seeing as he likes
to demoralise when he teaches.

06:42.796 --> 06:43.956
Bite me.

06:44.116 --> 06:46.916
There will be two-way critiques
on a daily basis.

06:48.396 --> 06:50.636
Now get to work.

06:50.796 --> 06:51.836
Let's go get
a patient.

06:51.996 --> 06:53.996
Well, the paramedics
just brought in an eye injury.

06:53.996 --> 06:56.436
This is ridiculous. I don't need
interns critiquing me.

06:56.436 --> 06:59.236
That's too bad, 'cause I was gonna
give you some advice on that tie.

06:59.236 --> 07:00.276
What's wrong
with my tie?

07:00.276 --> 07:01.396
Someone called
for a consult?

07:01.596 --> 07:03.276
Yup.
This-this tie
is Italian.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.876
(Looks fine.)

07:04.996 --> 07:06.436
Don't touch me.

07:06.596 --> 07:08.996
OK, present your patients
to me before you run any tests,

07:08.996 --> 07:10.955
and, uh, we can
discuss a differential

07:10.955 --> 07:12.715
and come up with
a plan together.

07:12.715 --> 07:14.595
Or I could come up
with a plan myself,

07:14.755 --> 07:17.995
and then you can tell me whether
or not you agree with it later?

07:18.115 --> 07:20.515
Four of Ativan.

07:20.675 --> 07:22.035
Hi, surgery.
Hey.

07:22.155 --> 07:23.235
Triple hit of LSD,

07:23.395 --> 07:25.155
peyote and crack
last night.

07:25.275 --> 07:26.595
That's pretty hardcore.

07:26.755 --> 07:28.595
Stabbed his belly
with a potato peeler.

07:28.755 --> 07:30.515
OK. It looks superficial.
Andrew?

07:30.635 --> 07:32.075
One percent with epi?

07:32.195 --> 07:33.515
Exactly right.

07:33.635 --> 07:34.595
You glad to be back?

07:34.755 --> 07:36.075
Yes, I am,
and I appreciate

07:36.195 --> 07:37.475
what you did for me.

07:37.595 --> 07:39.995
Well, I just helped it along
a bit. It was really Neela.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.315
Thought it was your idea.

07:41.435 --> 07:42.595
Well, they need
you up there.

07:42.755 --> 07:44.995
Well, if you ever need
anything, Dr Brenner,

07:45.115 --> 07:46.515
you just let me know.

07:46.595 --> 07:48.075
I owe you one.

07:48.475 --> 07:49.635
I know. I know.

07:49.755 --> 07:51.115
I love Lake Geneva.

07:51.275 --> 07:53.155
I was just hoping
we could stay here.

07:53.355 --> 07:54.715
Broken. Try down
the street.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.115
(SIGHS)

07:57.315 --> 07:59.355
I've been away
from Chicago so long,

07:59.515 --> 08:01.715
just being home
feels like a vacation.

08:01.715 --> 08:06.115
Next month, I promise
we will go to the lake.

08:06.115 --> 08:09.755
OK, now go back to work and make
us some money. I'll call you later.

08:09.755 --> 08:12.275
Agh! (SCREAMS)

08:12.275 --> 08:13.435
Oh, God!

08:13.435 --> 08:14.355
I got a gun.
I got a gun.

08:14.475 --> 08:15.355
Just pass me
your wallet.

08:15.435 --> 08:16.635
Doesn't have any cash in it.

08:16.795 --> 08:18.675
Lady, are you stupid?
Come on. Hand it over.

08:25.115 --> 08:27.075
(PANTS)

08:45.075 --> 08:46.994
Me? Go out.

08:47.114 --> 08:49.074
Come on, Ray.

09:03.074 --> 09:05.154
Hey, I do have a life.

09:06.794 --> 09:09.354
Last weekend, I went out
with friends for drinks.

09:09.354 --> 09:11.314
I'm not lying.

09:11.434 --> 09:13.714
Who are my friends?

09:13.794 --> 09:15.114
All right, fine.

09:15.234 --> 09:16.594
You know, I-I fell asleep

09:16.754 --> 09:18.954
watching three
Tracy/Hepburn movies, and...

09:20.674 --> 09:22.674
Stop laughing at me.

09:23.834 --> 09:25.754
I am not a loser.

09:25.754 --> 09:27.994
You saw how it cleaned up
the corneal rust, right?

09:28.154 --> 09:29.394
Yeah. It was
kind of scary.

09:29.554 --> 09:31.514
I mean, you can't drill
into the eye, right?

09:31.674 --> 09:33.354
No, the blades only
go down a millimetre.

09:33.474 --> 09:35.714
(GROANS) I can't breathe.

09:35.834 --> 09:37.434
What the hell did you do
to me?

09:37.594 --> 09:39.354
Another kick, I'd have
put you in the morgue.

09:39.514 --> 09:40.754
Oh, hear that?
she's threatening me!

09:40.874 --> 09:41.874
Victim of assault.

09:42.034 --> 09:43.194
Self-defence.
He tried to mug me.

09:43.354 --> 09:45.154
She crushed my chest.
Are you OK?

09:45.354 --> 09:46.874
I'm fine.
Blunt chest trauma,
decent vitals; pulse OK.

09:47.034 --> 09:48.394
Give me something
for the pain. Damn it.

09:48.514 --> 09:50.194
Once we assess you,
sir. You need to be checked out.

09:50.354 --> 09:51.954
No, forget it.
No, you've got a
pretty big contusion.

09:51.954 --> 09:53.594
All I need is some ice.

09:53.594 --> 09:54.874
Inferior orbit fracture.

09:54.874 --> 09:56.474
All right, quickly.
Come on.

09:56.474 --> 09:58.234
Decreased breath sounds
on the left.
I agree.

09:58.354 --> 09:59.434
(GROANS)

09:59.594 --> 10:01.714
I can't believe
I mugged a doctor.

10:01.714 --> 10:03.114
Not just a doctor.
She's the chief.

10:03.234 --> 10:04.194
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

10:04.354 --> 10:06.394
Is she an Apache or something?

10:06.554 --> 10:08.434
She runs this joint.
Oh, God, kill me now.

10:08.594 --> 10:10.194
OK, tenderness over
the fifth and sixth ribs.

10:10.394 --> 10:11.754
Four of morphine.
Mid-axillary line.

10:11.874 --> 10:13.074
What should we do, Tracy?

10:13.154 --> 10:14.594
Uh, obvious rib fractures.

10:14.754 --> 10:16.474
Collapsed lung.
He needs a chest tube.

10:16.634 --> 10:17.954
That's right.
Oh, no, no.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.314
Not necessarily.

10:19.434 --> 10:20.474
If it's a pure
pneumothorax,

10:20.633 --> 10:21.993
we can manage him
with a Heimlich valve.

10:21.993 --> 10:22.473
OK, let's do it.

10:22.473 --> 10:24.873
You're not holding back,
are you? No, I don't think so.
Me, either.

10:24.873 --> 10:26.513
With a trauma,
he needs a chest tube

10:26.513 --> 10:27.553
in case
there's any bleeding.

10:27.553 --> 10:28.953
I like to use
a 32 french.

10:28.953 --> 10:30.193
I'll open one up.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:30.193 --> 10:31.953
Why stick a garden
hose in his chest

10:32.113 --> 10:33.873
when we can get by
with a swizzle stick?

10:33.953 --> 10:35.033
Makes a lot of sense.

10:35.113 --> 10:36.273
Pulse ox 98.

10:36.393 --> 10:37.433
BP: 122/78.

10:37.553 --> 10:38.553
Well, he's stable for now.

10:38.673 --> 10:40.233
We can wait for the chest X-ray,

10:40.393 --> 10:42.393
and then decide
on a course of action.

10:42.553 --> 10:43.993
Yeah, and
when there's no haemothorax,

10:44.113 --> 10:45.033
we can do it my way.

10:46.193 --> 10:48.193
To the left. Right.

10:48.313 --> 10:50.953
Up and then down.

10:51.113 --> 10:53.313
Yeah, extraocular
movements are intact.

10:53.473 --> 10:55.273
Yeah. You really did
a number on that guy.

10:55.273 --> 10:59.913
Yeah. I took Tae Kwan Do for
the workout. Never thought
I'd have to use it.

11:00.633 --> 11:02.073
Well, it came in handy.

11:02.073 --> 11:05.073
When you have
an orbital blowout,

11:05.073 --> 11:06.993
the inferior rectus
can get trapped,

11:07.113 --> 11:09.873
and you can lack upgaze.

11:09.993 --> 11:11.633
I'm thinking
facial series.

11:11.753 --> 11:13.233
No, I don't need X-rays.

11:13.233 --> 11:17.353
All right, how about bacitracin on
the, uh, abrasions. Is that OK?

11:17.353 --> 11:20.513
It's broken, huh?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.233
Yes.

11:22.393 --> 11:24.833
My husband gave it to me
on our first anniversary.

11:24.953 --> 11:27.313
Want me to call him,
have him come pick you up?

11:27.313 --> 11:28.753
No, not while
the market's open.

11:28.753 --> 11:30.433
He's a commodities trader.

11:30.593 --> 11:31.633
Dr Banfield...

11:31.753 --> 11:32.913
Besides, I'm not leaving. What?

11:33.033 --> 11:34.073
You should go
home.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.553
We have a full board.

11:35.633 --> 11:36.833
We'll take care of it.

11:36.993 --> 11:38.793
We got a run,
five minutes out.

11:38.913 --> 11:39.993
Hmm.

11:40.113 --> 11:41.153
You OK,
Dr Banfield?

11:41.273 --> 11:42.313
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:42.473 --> 11:43.633
Your tetanus
up to date?

11:43.753 --> 11:44.793
Yeah. Of course it is.

11:48.073 --> 11:49.313
How far in?

11:49.433 --> 11:51.433
About three inches.

11:52.513 --> 11:53.673
Now attach the
Heimlich valve.

11:53.833 --> 11:54.833
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

11:54.993 --> 11:56.512
You put a gun
to her back,

11:56.672 --> 11:58.592
and all you can say
is you're sorry?

11:58.752 --> 12:00.352
It wasn't a gun. It wasn't a gun.

12:00.352 --> 12:02.512
Who the hell robs somebody
with a pink highlighter?

12:02.672 --> 12:04.912
A runner-up for
the Darwin Awards, that's who.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.272
And the connective
tubing goes to this
collection bag.

12:07.392 --> 12:08.552
Got it.

12:08.712 --> 12:10.072
But the valve leaflets
only flow one way,

12:10.072 --> 12:11.872
so no air or blood
can re-enter the chest.

12:12.072 --> 12:14.632
Unusual approach
with the Heimlich.

12:14.832 --> 12:16.432
Yeah, it's a pure
pneumothorax.

12:18.672 --> 12:20.632
Let's get him off
to the jail ward.

12:20.792 --> 12:22.312
Jail ward? I don't want to go
to the jail ward.

12:22.312 --> 12:24.672
Yeah. They'll
ignore him there.

12:24.832 --> 12:25.952
Let's keep him
for observation.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.712
I thought the
jail ward nurses

12:27.832 --> 12:28.912
could handle it.

12:29.072 --> 12:30.792
He's a moron, but he's still
our patient.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.432
Yeah, listen to her. She's the chief.

12:33.872 --> 12:35.152
See you.

12:35.152 --> 12:36.272
Hey.

12:36.272 --> 12:38.912
How was your
sleepover?

12:38.912 --> 12:40.992
Fun.
Yeah?

12:40.992 --> 12:41.872
You all ready
for your soccer tournament?

12:41.872 --> 12:43.272
Judy's mom's picking me up
in an hour.

12:43.272 --> 12:44.512
Good. I'm sorry
I can't be there.

12:44.512 --> 12:46.272
It's her first time
being a left wing.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.472
Oh, Daria, Sarah.
Sarah, Daria.

12:48.472 --> 12:50.032
Hey. Kick butt today.
Thanks.

12:50.152 --> 12:51.432
What are
you guys doing after?

12:51.432 --> 12:52.752
Pizza, movie.

12:52.752 --> 12:54.232
Why are you
talking like that?

12:54.232 --> 12:55.952
Like what?

12:55.952 --> 12:57.152
Like what?

12:57.152 --> 12:59.632
Toothache.

12:59.632 --> 13:00.552
Oh. Open
your mouth.

13:00.552 --> 13:01.712
You're not a dentist.

13:01.712 --> 13:02.952
Open your mouth.

13:04.312 --> 13:05.552
A tongue ring?!

13:05.552 --> 13:07.032
Ah, it's only a stud.

13:07.032 --> 13:08.272
When did you
get that?

13:08.272 --> 13:10.192
Last night
at Heather's sleepover.

13:10.192 --> 13:11.432
Her big sister took us
to get it.

13:11.432 --> 13:12.672
Isn't it cool?
no, it's not cool.

13:12.672 --> 13:16.752
Look, don't you have
to get a-a parent

13:16.752 --> 13:17.992
to sign off on
something like this?

13:17.992 --> 13:19.152
You're acting like
I killed someone.
You did!

13:19.152 --> 13:21.272
Me! now go wait
in the break room.

13:21.272 --> 13:23.592
What...?
I don't get it.

13:23.592 --> 13:25.832
What's this whole fad
about a tongue stud?

13:25.832 --> 13:28.792
Girls do it, you know,
to pleasure the boys.

13:28.792 --> 13:30.432
So I've heard.

13:32.991 --> 13:34.231
Julie O'Fallon.

13:34.231 --> 13:35.711
Fell off a six-foot wall
to cement surface.

13:35.711 --> 13:37.151
Head trauma
and obvious femur fracture.

13:37.151 --> 13:38.631
All right. How
you doing, Julie?

13:38.631 --> 13:41.351
I'm OK. I'm just really dizzy.

13:41.351 --> 13:42.511
Uh-huh.

13:42.511 --> 13:43.591
Is she gonna get shots?

13:43.591 --> 13:45.191
She hates shots,
and blood, too.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.391
All right, let's just
check you out first.

13:46.391 --> 13:47.831
You're gonna be OK,
sweetheart.

13:47.831 --> 13:49.231
All right, let's
get a trauma panel

13:49.231 --> 13:50.511
and portable
X-rays. Let's go.

13:50.511 --> 13:53.071
I keep telling her that if she wants
to be a serious gymnast,

13:53.071 --> 13:54.671
that she has to practice hard,
but that that wall

13:54.671 --> 13:56.711
is not a balance beam.
Pupils equal
and reactive.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.151
Good breath sounds.

13:58.311 --> 14:00.551
It hurts. They're gonna
fix you up, sweetie.

14:00.631 --> 14:01.871
105/70.

14:01.991 --> 14:02.951
Tachy at 120.

14:02.951 --> 14:04.271
Is that bad?

14:04.471 --> 14:05.671
Uh, it could be
from all the pain.

14:06.191 --> 14:07.391
So give her something.

14:07.391 --> 14:09.431
Well, it also could be from
the internal bleeding,

14:09.431 --> 14:11.791
in which case pain meds
could be dangerous,

14:11.791 --> 14:13.591
so just give us
a second, OK?

14:13.591 --> 14:14.671
Dr Gates?

14:14.791 --> 14:16.071
Blunt head trauma,

14:16.271 --> 14:19.231
femur fracture. I'm going
to clear the belly and
the neck,

14:19.231 --> 14:20.471
and then, uh,
send her to head CT.

14:20.591 --> 14:22.071
All right. Sounds like a plan.

14:22.191 --> 14:23.751
What does
this thing do?

14:23.751 --> 14:25.471
Oh, that's called
a rapid infuser,

14:25.471 --> 14:27.031
but your sister
doesn't need that.

14:27.031 --> 14:29.511
Liver and spleen
look good.

14:29.671 --> 14:31.751
Is this where you keep
all the tubes and stuff?

14:31.751 --> 14:34.951
No. Uh, move away from there.

14:34.951 --> 14:36.831
Claire, what
did I tell you

14:36.951 --> 14:38.071
about touching things?!

14:38.191 --> 14:39.151
Will you come over here?!

14:39.311 --> 14:41.471
Will you just stay
here next to me?

14:41.671 --> 14:44.711
Foot pulses two
plus and equal.

14:44.911 --> 14:47.231
ALARM BEEPS
Pressure's down
to 80 systolic.

14:47.351 --> 14:49.031
All right, bolus
20 per kilo.

14:49.031 --> 14:50.631
Julie, you OK?

14:51.391 --> 14:52.551
Mommy.

14:52.671 --> 14:54.431
Mom.
You OK, Julie?

14:54.431 --> 14:55.591
Sats are only 88.

14:55.591 --> 14:57.151
100% nonrebreather.

14:57.151 --> 14:58.831
Give me an intubation
tray and a 6-0 tube.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.031
What's happening?

15:00.031 --> 15:02.351
Could be the head injury or maybe
there's blood loss in the thigh.

15:02.351 --> 15:04.031
All right, give
her some oxygen.

15:05.951 --> 15:07.151
OK, good news, Freda.

15:07.271 --> 15:09.110
You didn't
break your hip.

15:09.270 --> 15:10.310
Are you sure?

15:10.470 --> 15:12.030
Feels broken to me.

15:12.030 --> 15:13.550
It's a bad bruise.

15:13.670 --> 15:14.710
I think it's broken.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.350
What do you think
of the belly?

15:16.470 --> 15:17.590
Pretty benign.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.590
The epigastric pain's
an ongoing problem.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.790
I, uh, saw your post-op
Billroth wound infection.

15:21.910 --> 15:22.950
And?

15:23.110 --> 15:24.430
We'll admit him.
Glad you agree.

15:24.630 --> 15:26.190
Andrew, h and p
in curtain 2.

15:26.350 --> 15:28.030
You mind if I go,
Dr Dubenko?

15:28.150 --> 15:29.310
No, not a problem.

15:29.430 --> 15:31.590
I've got reflux
esophagitis.

15:31.710 --> 15:32.790
I've tried everything.

15:32.910 --> 15:34.390
Nothing helps.

15:34.510 --> 15:36.550
Well, maybe if you'd stop
smoking cigarettes...

15:38.990 --> 15:40.390
I'm 80 years old.

15:40.510 --> 15:42.310
This is my only joy.

15:42.390 --> 15:43.670
Oh, I do a little X, too.

15:43.670 --> 15:46.150
What do you have,
nursing home raves?

15:46.150 --> 15:49.030
You'd be surprised what a girl's
libido does at my age.

15:49.030 --> 15:51.830
Look, Freda, I don't want you
to fall again.

15:51.830 --> 15:53.270
I've organised for a
nurse to come around

15:53.270 --> 15:55.990
and give you a home
safety assessment.

15:55.990 --> 15:57.630
You're gonna need
a night light

15:57.630 --> 15:59.710
and a walker.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.150
And I'd lay off the X.

16:01.550 --> 16:03.750
Do you make house
calls, Simon?

16:03.750 --> 16:06.030
I get up from my nap at 7:00.

16:06.030 --> 16:09.590
You listen to Dr Brenner,
Freda. You'll be fine.

16:09.590 --> 16:10.790
Listen to him. Dr Morris.

16:10.790 --> 16:13.310
Interesting use of the
Heimlich valve this morning.

16:13.310 --> 16:14.430
Yeah, how's he doing?

16:14.430 --> 16:16.190
He's doing well
on room air. How's Dr Banfield?

16:16.190 --> 16:17.910
Unfazed.
She's still working.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.110
Hey!

16:19.110 --> 16:20.990
What are you doing here?

16:20.990 --> 16:21.990
Hey.

16:21.990 --> 16:24.070
Oh, pilates.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.550
I fell off the reformer.

16:25.550 --> 16:28.390
Ryan, finish those charts,
then find me.

16:28.390 --> 16:29.750
I will take it
from here.

16:29.750 --> 16:32.310
This is one of my VIP patients.
(CHUCKLES)

16:32.310 --> 16:34.670
Pressure's up
and so are the sats.

16:34.670 --> 16:36.430
She's doing much better. Do we
really have to intubate her?

16:36.430 --> 16:38.670
Trust me. You don't want her
off in CT without an airway.

16:38.670 --> 16:40.150
We're gonna put a tube
in your mouth,

16:40.150 --> 16:41.950
and when you wake up,
it's gonna help you breathe.

16:41.950 --> 16:43.310
I don't want that.

16:43.310 --> 16:44.949
It won't be too bad.
I promise.

16:44.949 --> 16:47.629
Mom, I have to go
to the bathroom.

16:47.629 --> 16:49.629
All right, premedicate
with Lido, Fent and atropine.

16:49.629 --> 16:51.029
You have time.

16:51.029 --> 16:52.789
We have to wait
at least three minutes.

16:52.789 --> 16:54.109
OK, we'll be right back.

16:54.669 --> 16:56.869
All right, etomidate
and sux. Let's go.

16:56.869 --> 16:58.749
All right, bag her up.
Get ready.

16:58.749 --> 16:59.869
My mom said I fell.

16:59.869 --> 17:02.749
I checked the cuff.
I didn't fall.

17:03.709 --> 17:05.429
She pushed me...

17:05.429 --> 17:06.749
She pushed me.

19:34.668 --> 19:36.268
OK.

19:36.268 --> 19:37.988
It's been hard.

19:37.988 --> 19:39.988
My whole life revolved
around my mom.

19:39.988 --> 19:42.108
It's good you had that.

19:42.108 --> 19:43.508
Yeah.

19:44.948 --> 19:47.428
Packing up her
things was weird.

19:47.428 --> 19:51.788
You know, our entire lives
get reduced to a garage sale.

19:51.788 --> 19:54.028
And if you can't get rid
of your parents' stuff

19:54.028 --> 19:55.108
on a Saturday morning,

19:55.108 --> 19:57.387
then you're dropping it off
at Goodwill on Sunday night.

19:57.387 --> 19:59.947
My dad died a year ago.

19:59.947 --> 20:01.867
I'm still not over it.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.827
You know, I haven't even
disconnected her phone yet.

20:05.627 --> 20:07.427
Sometimes I
call it...

20:07.427 --> 20:10.747
just to listen to the sound
of her voice on the machine.

20:11.787 --> 20:12.987
Sit tight.

20:12.987 --> 20:14.387
I'm gonna go order an X-ray.

20:15.907 --> 20:17.987
Hey, did you see
my clotted dialysis shunt?

20:17.987 --> 20:19.307
Yeah. I put
in a Quinton.

20:19.307 --> 20:21.987
Lucien, wait up.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.707
Got something
to discuss with you.

20:23.707 --> 20:26.107
Uh, Dr Rasgotra
discovered

20:26.107 --> 20:28.307
an abscess on
the, uh, Billroth patient.

20:28.307 --> 20:29.587
Was there a delay?
no, no, not at all.

20:29.587 --> 20:30.867
No, I just, uh...
What?

20:30.867 --> 20:32.947
I thought
you could help me out.
What?

20:32.947 --> 20:34.267
I wanted to thank her.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.987
Oh. No, no, no.
Absolutely not.

20:35.987 --> 20:37.947
Why?
I'm a surgeon,
not a yenta.

20:37.947 --> 20:39.347
No, but...

20:39.347 --> 20:40.507
but you're colleagues,
you're friends.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.667
No, we're work friends. I know
nothing about her personal life.

20:43.507 --> 20:45.907
You know what she likes,
what she doesn't like.

20:45.907 --> 20:47.307
In the OR.

20:47.307 --> 20:48.427
When I walk out
of the hospital,

20:48.427 --> 20:49.587
that's the end of our
personal relationship, OK?

20:49.587 --> 20:51.707
Can I make a
quick suggestion?

20:51.707 --> 20:54.227
Find somebody else to bang
and cast aside, OK?

20:54.227 --> 20:56.147
Neela doesn't deserve that.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.827
Lots of times when parents
encourage their kids

21:01.827 --> 21:04.507
to do their best,
they lose their patience.

21:04.507 --> 21:05.787
I don't believe this.

21:05.787 --> 21:07.307
She said you pushed her.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.547
Are you kidding me?

21:08.547 --> 21:10.507
We got her X-rays back.

21:10.507 --> 21:12.707
She has multiple
old fractures.

21:12.707 --> 21:14.907
She's an athlete.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.707
She's 13.

21:18.307 --> 21:19.987
Claire.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.347
Get over here.

21:25.667 --> 21:27.987
You saw your sister fall.
Tell them what happened.

21:29.227 --> 21:31.467
All right, now is not
the time to be bashful.

21:31.467 --> 21:33.346
What did you see?

21:34.866 --> 21:36.426
I was in my room...

21:36.426 --> 21:38.506
and I heard her scream.

21:38.506 --> 21:41.466
Keep going.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.426
Let her talk,
Mrs O'Fallon.

21:43.426 --> 21:45.546
And then I looked
outside my window,

21:45.546 --> 21:46.786
and she was
on the ground.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.626
And I wasn't
anywhere near her, right?

21:51.626 --> 21:53.346
Right.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.826
That's when I
came and got you.

21:54.826 --> 21:56.346
In your room.

21:56.346 --> 21:57.506
There.

21:57.506 --> 21:59.386
You heard her.

22:03.506 --> 22:05.666
Claire, you can go back in.

22:08.186 --> 22:10.546
Well, we're still gonna have
to call social services.

22:10.546 --> 22:11.826
They're gonna have
to review this.

22:11.826 --> 22:13.226
What?

22:13.226 --> 22:15.466
What do you think,
I coached her?

22:16.586 --> 22:18.506
This is crazy.

22:18.506 --> 22:20.706
Do whatever you have to.

22:20.706 --> 22:22.346
Just please take care
of my daughter.

22:27.506 --> 22:28.906
This is your first
trauma with me.

22:29.066 --> 22:30.746
Watch and learn.
OK. Great.

22:30.866 --> 22:32.706
60-year-old belted passenger,
T-boned with intrusion.

22:32.826 --> 22:34.226
Alert, tachy to 110.

22:34.346 --> 22:36.426
Some guy ran a red light.
I didn't even see him coming.

22:36.586 --> 22:38.386
Her son Chuck was walking
on scene, refused treatment.

22:38.546 --> 22:39.666
I'm Dr Brenner.
This is Dr Martin.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.826
Look, she's in a lot of pain.
How bad is she hurt?

22:42.026 --> 22:44.146
Probable rib, humerus
and pelvic fractures.

22:44.306 --> 22:45.426
None of that sounds
too serious.

22:45.546 --> 22:47.746
She'll be fine.
We need to do a complete exam

22:47.746 --> 22:48.786
before assessing
her prognosis.

22:48.786 --> 22:51.626
How'd your respiratory
physiology exam go?

22:51.626 --> 22:53.586
Uh, I think I flunked it.

22:53.586 --> 22:55.946
I used to feel the same way
after every med school test.

22:55.946 --> 22:58.106
Well, maybe I just
need a good mentor.

22:58.106 --> 23:00.186
I hear you're
a real rock star.

23:00.186 --> 23:01.506
You did?
Mm-hmm.

23:01.506 --> 23:03.346
I've been looking for you.
Judy's mom's outside.

23:03.346 --> 23:05.546
Well, good luck, and make sure
you come back after the game.

23:05.546 --> 23:06.866
What about pizza and a movie?

23:06.866 --> 23:08.385
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

23:08.385 --> 23:09.385
I've instructed Judy's mom
to bring you

23:09.385 --> 23:10.545
back here after the game,

23:10.545 --> 23:13.385
and take that thing
out of your tongue.
No.

23:13.625 --> 23:14.505
Yes! Take it out
of your tongue!
I'm not gonna do it!

23:14.505 --> 23:16.225
You're gonna do it
when you come back!

23:16.225 --> 23:17.705
If I have to get
the pliers out...
(GROANS)

23:19.865 --> 23:21.705
You need to have the talk.

23:21.705 --> 23:23.265
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

23:23.265 --> 23:25.185
Tony, if she's gonna
have oral sex...

23:25.185 --> 23:26.985
# La-la-la-la... #
She can get an STD.

23:26.985 --> 23:28.305
Hey! it's not a joke.

23:28.305 --> 23:29.665
I'm not laughing.

23:29.665 --> 23:30.985
A woman should have
that talk with her.

23:30.985 --> 23:32.425
In fact, why don't
you have the talk?

23:32.425 --> 23:33.545
It's not my place.

23:33.545 --> 23:35.905
Look, if-if Alex ever needs
to have the man talk,

23:35.905 --> 23:37.985
I'll return
the favour.
Alex is 15.

23:37.985 --> 23:39.505
I had that conversation with him
when he was ten.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.505
Ten?
Yeah.

23:41.505 --> 23:42.905
Isn't that a little young?

23:42.905 --> 23:44.745
Trauma panel,
type and cross four,

23:44.745 --> 23:46.665
C-spine, chest,
pelvis and left humerus.

23:46.665 --> 23:49.065
Head CT, abdominal CT,
pelvic CT.

23:49.065 --> 23:50.825
Easy, Tracy.
Foley, NG and...

23:50.825 --> 23:52.305
Let's just start with the labs
and plain films first.

23:52.305 --> 23:54.105
Where are you hurting,
Mrs Holmes?

23:54.105 --> 23:55.665
Everywhere. Richard...

23:55.665 --> 23:58.305
call the insurance company.

23:58.305 --> 24:01.105
Those jerks tried
to rip me off in '67.

24:01.105 --> 24:02.545
Mom, it's Chuck.
You got to calm down.

24:02.545 --> 24:04.745
Flail chest
on the right,

24:04.745 --> 24:05.945
decreased breath sounds.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.665
Bp: 95/60.
Somebody, turn on the grill.

24:09.185 --> 24:11.385
I was thinking about
making some brisket.

24:11.385 --> 24:12.545
Chuck:
She's got
Alzheimer's.

24:12.545 --> 24:14.425
My mom can get loopy.

24:14.425 --> 24:16.785
Tracy, start a second line.
Do you want a subclavian?

24:16.785 --> 24:18.745
Just a peripheral 18 gauge.

24:19.785 --> 24:21.305
Has she had any other
medical problems?

24:21.305 --> 24:22.585
No, she used to be

24:22.585 --> 24:24.305
healthy as a horse.
Wouldn't even take aspirin.

24:24.305 --> 24:25.385
Loved the outdoors.

24:25.385 --> 24:26.865
That's why I
was taking her for a drive.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.225
BP's down to 80 systolic.

24:28.225 --> 24:29.825
OK, call surgery.

24:29.825 --> 24:32.105
She needs intubation,
chest tube, and central line.

24:32.745 --> 24:34.705
Somebody, get the door.

24:34.705 --> 24:36.705
Wow, this is
a great teaching case.

24:41.465 --> 24:42.945
Where do you live,
Mrs O'Fallon?

24:42.945 --> 24:44.544
We just moved to Bridgeport.

24:44.544 --> 24:46.864
The company that I work for
opened a new store there.

24:46.864 --> 24:49.384
This is our third move
in two years.

24:49.384 --> 24:51.704
Must be tough
relocating all the time.

24:51.704 --> 24:53.584
No, it's not hard.

24:53.584 --> 24:55.144
We travel well.

24:55.144 --> 24:56.904
You know, everyone gets mad
at their kids.

24:56.904 --> 24:59.064
What do you do when that happens,
Mrs O'Fallon?

24:59.064 --> 25:01.864
I, uh, count to ten.

25:01.864 --> 25:04.504
I ask them to sit down,

25:04.504 --> 25:06.864
think about what they did,
and then we talk about it.

25:06.864 --> 25:09.624
Hey, we're out of
suction catheters.

25:09.624 --> 25:11.464
Do you ever
raise your voice?

25:11.464 --> 25:14.064
Yeah. What, is that not allowed?

25:14.064 --> 25:15.864
Have you ever
been physical with Julie?

25:18.784 --> 25:20.704
Be honest. She's gonna talk to both
your kids.

25:20.704 --> 25:23.504
Yeah, maybe once or twice
when they weren't listening.

25:23.504 --> 25:26.224
You know how you grab a kid,
say, "Stop touching the stove."

25:26.224 --> 25:27.944
What was it like
when you did that?

25:27.944 --> 25:30.064
What do you mean?
How did it make you feel?

25:31.944 --> 25:34.864
Look, my father beat
the crap out of me.

25:34.864 --> 25:37.104
And I wasn't gonna do that
to my girls.

25:37.104 --> 25:39.504
ALARMS BEEP

25:39.504 --> 25:41.344
What's going on
in there?

25:42.144 --> 25:43.824
Sats are dropping.

25:43.824 --> 25:45.544
I don't know what's wrong.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.544
Do something.

25:47.344 --> 25:49.184
I don't think she's breathing.

25:49.184 --> 25:50.704
Pulse is weak
and thready.

25:52.504 --> 25:53.904
Cycle the dynamap.

25:56.544 --> 25:57.904
What's the story?

25:57.904 --> 26:00.224
She's got a haemopneumothor...
MVA PSI, haemopneumothorax,

26:00.224 --> 26:01.704
pubic ramus
and humerus fractures.

26:01.704 --> 26:03.144
How's the belly?

26:03.144 --> 26:04.984
Fast scan negative.

26:04.984 --> 26:08.144
Were you drinking?
Is that how this happened?

26:08.144 --> 26:09.584
Someone hit us, Dad.

26:09.584 --> 26:10.584
How do we know that?

26:10.584 --> 26:12.304
Chest tube output?

26:12.304 --> 26:14.424
300cc's so far.
Not so bad.

26:14.424 --> 26:15.744
Did you give him
a breathalyzer?

26:15.744 --> 26:17.184
He's a drunk.

26:17.184 --> 26:18.544
I've been clean
for eight months.

26:18.544 --> 26:21.383
You haven't been clean
since you were 16.

26:21.383 --> 26:23.143
Second two units are up.

26:23.143 --> 26:24.863
Right-sided rib fractures.

26:24.863 --> 26:25.903
Probably the liver.

26:25.903 --> 26:27.063
There's nothing there.

26:27.063 --> 26:28.783
Yeah, let's look again.
Shouldn't we check the pelvis?

26:28.783 --> 26:31.063
It's unlikely with
an anterior fracture.

26:31.063 --> 26:33.343
I think it's
in the chest.
It's probably a contusion.

26:33.343 --> 26:35.103
We need to think about
a right-sided thoracotomy.

26:35.103 --> 26:36.703
You crazy?
It's not the chest.

26:36.703 --> 26:38.423
Bradying down.

26:38.423 --> 26:39.743
Give me the ultrasound.

26:39.743 --> 26:41.423
Heart rate 40.
Amp of atropine.

26:41.423 --> 26:42.703
Look at this.

26:42.703 --> 26:44.303
There's blood pooling
in the hemithorax.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.143
Thoracotomy tray.
Neela?

26:46.143 --> 26:46.663
We lost a pulse.

26:46.663 --> 26:48.103
Start compressions.

26:48.103 --> 26:51.183
If she's not OK...
so help me, God.

26:52.423 --> 26:54.183
Systolic's down to 70.

26:54.183 --> 26:55.703
Bolus 250 of saline.

26:55.703 --> 26:57.463
What's happening?
Pulse ox in the low 80s.

26:57.463 --> 26:58.703
Think she
dropped a lung?

26:58.703 --> 27:00.343
Is she dying?

27:00.343 --> 27:02.383
No. Breath sounds good bilaterally.

27:02.383 --> 27:04.743
Call for
a portable chest.
Someone talk to me.

27:04.743 --> 27:06.543
What about a fat embolus?

27:06.543 --> 27:07.823
What is that?

27:09.943 --> 27:13.463
Uh, when you break a large bone,
like she did in her thigh,

27:13.463 --> 27:15.183
fat from the bone marrow

27:15.183 --> 27:17.143
can travel up and
damage the lungs.

27:17.143 --> 27:19.703
It can be
very serious.

27:21.383 --> 27:23.263
Why is she only on 21% oxygen?

27:23.263 --> 27:24.943
I had it at 100.

27:24.943 --> 27:26.783
Somebody turned off the O2.
What?

27:26.783 --> 27:28.703
That would explain it.

27:28.703 --> 27:31.343
I had the rate at 16
after the ABG.

27:31.343 --> 27:33.423
Oh, God, please.

27:33.423 --> 27:34.743
Sure you didn't fiddle
with the FIO2?

27:34.743 --> 27:36.423
No. I mean,
I don't think so.

27:36.423 --> 27:38.143
It is a touch screen, though.
I could've...

27:38.143 --> 27:39.783
Has this happened before?

27:39.783 --> 27:40.943
No.

27:43.303 --> 27:45.583
All right, repeat a blood gas
in 20 minutes.

27:45.583 --> 27:48.423
Gates, recheck
Doppler pulses

27:48.423 --> 27:49.823
in her foot and call Ortho

27:49.823 --> 27:51.583
and see how long before
they can take her to the OR.

27:53.342 --> 27:55.302
You people should
have been in here

27:55.302 --> 27:57.582
instead of outside grilling me.

32:03.820 --> 32:05.780
I'm not so sure
if the mom pushed her.

32:05.780 --> 32:07.060
You heard her.

32:07.060 --> 32:09.380
Yeah, she said, "She pushed me."
I think it was the daughter.

32:09.380 --> 32:10.740
What, the
12-year-old?

32:10.740 --> 32:12.260
The mother displays

32:12.260 --> 32:14.460
all the classic signs
of child abuse.

32:14.460 --> 32:16.620
Unrealistic
expectations.

32:16.620 --> 32:18.660
She moves around a lot.
She's unemployed.

32:18.660 --> 32:19.660
Dr Gates...
Depression.

32:19.660 --> 32:21.420
She was abused
as a child.

32:21.420 --> 32:22.620
Did you see the
way she grabbed

32:22.620 --> 32:24.900
those kids? I've seen it.
I grew up with it.

32:24.900 --> 32:27.500
We'll let
social services decide.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.220
Fine.

32:29.220 --> 32:30.299
How's that board look?

32:30.299 --> 32:32.259
Oh, we're down to 44
in the waiting room.

32:32.259 --> 32:34.339
That's great. I mean,
it's usually closer to 100.

32:34.339 --> 32:36.779
And, uh, two tele admissions
are going upstairs.

32:36.779 --> 32:38.339
That will free
up some beds.

32:38.339 --> 32:39.459
So what's up?

32:39.459 --> 32:41.179
No broken bones
on the X-ray.

32:41.179 --> 32:43.139
Just a sprain.
Should I get a stirrup?

32:43.139 --> 32:44.419
No, an ace bandage
is fine.

32:44.419 --> 32:46.259
You know the drill: ice, rest,

32:46.259 --> 32:48.059
elevation...
And early
weight bearing

32:48.059 --> 32:49.859
gives superior
functional results

32:49.859 --> 32:51.779
compared to
immobilization.

32:51.779 --> 32:52.859
2004 Cochran review.

32:52.859 --> 32:54.819
Are you back in school
for physical therapy?

32:54.819 --> 32:55.899
Started a month ago.

32:55.899 --> 32:57.379
Great.

32:57.379 --> 32:58.779
All set.

32:58.779 --> 33:01.259
Well, it was, uh, great
seeing you again,

33:01.259 --> 33:02.539
Christine.

33:02.539 --> 33:04.419
Hopefully you'll stay on the
pilates machine next time.

33:04.419 --> 33:06.259
Uh, yeah, I'll try.

33:07.859 --> 33:09.539
Oh, here.

33:09.539 --> 33:11.099
Oh, uh, thank you.

33:14.619 --> 33:17.579
Look, I was just
wondering if...

33:17.579 --> 33:20.059
maybe you were free later.

33:22.539 --> 33:24.819
Oh, um...

33:24.819 --> 33:27.339
Well, I'm-I'm-I'm...

33:27.339 --> 33:30.139
I'm flattered,
Christine, but, um,

33:30.139 --> 33:32.419
we have a policy
against dating patients.

33:32.419 --> 33:34.339
Technically,
she's my patient.

33:35.899 --> 33:37.459
Yeah... well,
I'm sorry.

33:37.459 --> 33:39.019
I can't.
Dr Morris?

33:39.019 --> 33:40.979
I can't.

33:40.979 --> 33:43.779
Well... (LAUGHS)

33:47.699 --> 33:49.019
Here.

33:49.019 --> 33:51.579
If you change
your mind...

33:51.579 --> 33:52.859
call me.

33:54.099 --> 33:55.259
Thanks.

33:58.779 --> 34:00.819
What the hell
was that about?

34:07.298 --> 34:08.978
Suction, Andrew.

34:08.978 --> 34:10.578
Let's hope we don't have
to access the aorta.

34:10.578 --> 34:12.338
I'll divert the tube
to the left main stem.

34:12.338 --> 34:13.618
Why would you do that?

34:13.618 --> 34:14.858
Makes it easier for Neela
to clamp the right hilum.

34:14.858 --> 34:15.978
Fifth unit is up.

34:15.978 --> 34:17.378
Satinsky to Neela.

34:19.898 --> 34:21.098
That's better.

34:21.098 --> 34:22.578
I see the hilum.

34:23.458 --> 34:24.538
She's not perfusing.

34:26.138 --> 34:27.978
And we're clamped.

34:27.978 --> 34:28.978
More suction.

34:28.978 --> 34:30.217
Breath sounds on the left.

34:31.098 --> 34:32.538
Good call. Looks dry.

34:32.538 --> 34:35.818
Heart rate up to 50.
Got a femoral pulse.

34:35.818 --> 34:36.978
That's good, right?
It's great.

34:36.978 --> 34:38.578
It's excellent.

34:38.578 --> 34:40.378
Page Ortho.

34:40.378 --> 34:41.777
We're gonna meet them
in the OR.

34:42.938 --> 34:44.178
Can we follow?

34:44.178 --> 34:46.257
You stay here. Until you prove
you're not drunk,

34:46.257 --> 34:48.217
I don't want you
anywhere near your mother.

34:48.217 --> 34:51.578
She likes salsa dancing
and screwball comedies.

34:51.578 --> 34:53.458
You hurt her, I'll remove
your gallbladder.

34:56.018 --> 34:57.298
Not good.

34:57.298 --> 34:58.298
She implicated
the mother?

34:58.298 --> 35:00.298
Yells, loses her temper

35:00.298 --> 35:01.898
from time to time,
spanks them.

35:01.898 --> 35:04.138
I need to get Child
Protective Services involved.

35:04.138 --> 35:06.458
Think you'll be able to
keep the kids together?

35:06.458 --> 35:08.458
Since the dad's not in the
picture, Claire will probably

35:08.458 --> 35:10.058
go into
foster care.

35:10.058 --> 35:11.618
By the time her
sister's released,

35:11.618 --> 35:13.298
maybe a relative
will step up and take them.

35:13.298 --> 35:15.738
If all goes well,
she'll be discharged in a week.

35:15.738 --> 35:17.258
Great, I'll start the paperwork.

35:17.258 --> 35:20.538
Well... that's settled.

35:25.458 --> 35:27.858
This blood test will show
us your alcohol level.

35:27.858 --> 35:29.658
Which will be zero.

35:29.658 --> 35:31.338
Can you guys rush this,
so my dad can calm down?

35:31.338 --> 35:33.538
One test is not gonna
solve the problem.

35:33.538 --> 35:35.058
Trust me, I know.

35:35.058 --> 35:36.577
All right,
you're all set.

35:36.577 --> 35:38.777
Your mom will be out of
surgery in a coupla hours.

35:38.777 --> 35:40.857
I'll go get some coffee,
give my dad some space.

35:40.857 --> 35:42.937
Hate to get all Jerry Springer
in the waiting room.

35:42.937 --> 35:44.337
Thanks.

35:44.337 --> 35:46.977
And back in Oz,
we don't waste

35:46.977 --> 35:48.897
tax dollars
on family disputes.

35:48.897 --> 35:51.057
We talk it out
over a beer.

35:51.057 --> 35:53.057
Well, that
was nice of you.

35:53.057 --> 35:54.257
What's so funny?

35:54.257 --> 35:55.977
Your accent. It's cute.

35:55.977 --> 35:58.137
I dated this guy
in New Zealand once.

35:58.137 --> 36:00.897
I spent a summer there
in college

36:00.897 --> 36:01.577
teaching Maori kids
science.

36:01.577 --> 36:03.137
New Zealand?

36:03.137 --> 36:04.257
It's... it's
totally different.

36:04.257 --> 36:05.337
Oh, well,
if you say so.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.257
The shopping sucked.

36:07.257 --> 36:08.577
Do you miss Sydney?

36:08.577 --> 36:10.217
Every now and again.

36:10.217 --> 36:11.497
Where are you from?

36:11.497 --> 36:13.137
Newton, Mass.

36:13.137 --> 36:14.697
You didn't want to
train at the Brigham?

36:14.697 --> 36:15.577
No, I'm all about
Michigan Avenue.

36:15.577 --> 36:17.737
Get Banfield!

36:26.577 --> 36:28.737
My God, what happened?

36:29.577 --> 36:31.097
Get security.

36:31.097 --> 36:33.057
I saw a piece of
glass in Julie's leg,

36:33.057 --> 36:35.257
and I wanted to get it out
with the tweezers, but I wanted

36:35.257 --> 36:36.977
to sterilize them
with a flame first

36:36.977 --> 36:38.657
so she didn't get
an infection.

36:38.657 --> 36:40.497
But I accidentally dropped it
on the bedsheet.

36:40.497 --> 36:42.297
Take her to another room,

36:42.297 --> 36:43.617
and don't let her
leave your sight.

36:43.617 --> 36:45.257
Looks like 15%
body surface area,

36:45.257 --> 36:46.577
nothing circumferential.

36:46.577 --> 36:47.817
Let's go.

36:48.777 --> 36:50.337
I didn't mean it.
I was just helping!

36:50.897 --> 36:52.257
What should I do?

36:52.257 --> 36:53.697
Hang another litre
of Ringer's.

36:53.697 --> 36:55.897
Dr Brenner,
call the burn unit,

36:55.897 --> 36:57.937
and get back
to your other patients.

37:04.217 --> 37:05.617
Who are you,
Stevie Wonder?

37:05.617 --> 37:07.817
Did you see
her smile, her legs?

37:07.817 --> 37:09.017
Isn't she lovely?

37:09.017 --> 37:10.217
Forget lovely.
I'm not doing it.

37:10.217 --> 37:11.776
Why? Give me
one good reason.

37:13.016 --> 37:14.136
You're gay.

37:14.136 --> 37:15.216
Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

37:15.216 --> 37:16.656
I'm not gay.
You're seeing
someone.

37:16.656 --> 37:18.256
She...
Impotent?

37:18.256 --> 37:20.376
She's a patient.
A technicality.

37:20.376 --> 37:21.856
Do it for the team.

37:21.856 --> 37:23.616
OK, here it is,
Sanchez, OK?

37:23.616 --> 37:25.696
She's a call girl.

37:26.576 --> 37:28.536
Yeah, a whore,
an escort.

37:28.536 --> 37:30.776
So it's even better
than I thought.

37:30.776 --> 37:32.776
We're all whores.

37:32.776 --> 37:35.056
You prescribe antibiotics
from some drug companies

37:35.056 --> 37:37.456
that give you stethoscopes
and free lunch... whore.

37:37.456 --> 37:38.656
Hey, look.

37:38.656 --> 37:41.096
I am done with
dating, Ryan.

37:41.096 --> 37:42.336
The last girl
I really liked

37:42.336 --> 37:44.176
took my heart
to Caracas.

37:44.176 --> 37:46.536
So you're just gonna sit
on the sidelines forever?

37:46.536 --> 37:48.336
Yeah, that's the plan.

37:48.336 --> 37:49.616
Then, I need another mentor.

37:49.616 --> 37:51.016
Why?

37:51.016 --> 37:52.176
Because I want someone
who's well rounded

37:52.176 --> 37:53.776
and understands
interpersonal relationships.

37:53.776 --> 37:55.256
I understand them.

37:56.296 --> 37:58.256
Then, get in the game,
Archibald.

37:58.256 --> 38:00.776
It's time.

38:07.136 --> 38:09.496
Keep the Ringer's
at 85cc's per hour.

38:09.496 --> 38:11.496
Ortho's ready for her in the OR,

38:11.496 --> 38:12.536
and then she
has a burn unit bed.

38:12.536 --> 38:14.216
Well, let's move her
to surgery.

38:14.216 --> 38:15.776
Why does she need that?

38:15.776 --> 38:17.656
They need
to pin the femur.

38:17.656 --> 38:19.976
She gonna be OK?
She's gonna be fine.

38:21.896 --> 38:24.136
But we need to talk
about something else.

38:25.856 --> 38:27.456
I'm afraid Claire

38:27.456 --> 38:29.736
is a danger to others,
Mrs O'Fallon.

38:31.176 --> 38:34.216
No, it was an accident
like she said.

38:34.216 --> 38:36.056
There was no glass
in Julie's leg.

38:36.056 --> 38:37.856
How do you know
if her legs were burned?

38:37.856 --> 38:40.176
Look, I realize this is hard.
Claire is a good kid.

38:40.176 --> 38:42.456
Has she been depressed lately?

38:42.456 --> 38:44.456
No.

38:44.456 --> 38:47.095
I mean, maybe a little.

38:47.095 --> 38:49.655
Uh, her friend got hit
by a car last spring,

38:49.655 --> 38:51.215
but I thought
she was over that.

38:51.215 --> 38:53.055
Someone from Psychiatry
needs to talk to her.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.895
Why?

38:56.895 --> 38:59.135
She's just acting out.

38:59.135 --> 39:00.975
Well, we'll see if they agree.

39:00.975 --> 39:03.495
And if they don't?

39:03.495 --> 39:07.175
Then she might need to spend
some time in the hospital.

39:08.575 --> 39:10.615
My kids are OK.

39:13.695 --> 39:16.375
Claire's down the hall.
You're welcome to go be with her.

39:19.375 --> 39:21.815
You know, physical
and psychological things

39:21.815 --> 39:23.815
can push kids to do
all kinds of stuff.

39:23.815 --> 39:25.935
I know, Dr Gates.
And if this woman is hurting them,

39:25.935 --> 39:27.335
then all of this
makes sense.

39:27.335 --> 39:29.375
We're both trying to get
to the bottom of it.

39:29.375 --> 39:31.815
Go clear some patients.

42:38.253 --> 42:40.413
You score any goals?

42:43.053 --> 42:44.853
They got to go get pizza
and see a movie,

42:44.853 --> 42:46.373
and I'm stuck here.

42:46.373 --> 42:48.253
Why can't I go home?

42:48.253 --> 42:51.013
You take that thing out?
No, it's my body,

42:51.013 --> 42:52.573
and I can do what
I want with it.

42:52.573 --> 42:54.493
Sarah, I know it's your body.

42:54.493 --> 42:57.173
This is something
we have to discuss.

42:57.173 --> 42:59.453
You know, you're getting
to that age where you...

42:59.453 --> 43:02.973
you know, you're starting
to get curious about boys

43:02.973 --> 43:05.893
and... sex.

43:05.893 --> 43:08.373
What does a tongue stud
have to do with sex?

43:08.373 --> 43:10.133
Come on, Sarah.
Don't play dumb with me.

43:10.133 --> 43:13.453
That's not why I got it.

43:13.453 --> 43:15.933
Do you have a boyfriend?
No.

43:15.933 --> 43:17.653
And I'm not having sex.

43:17.653 --> 43:19.253
We thought it
would be fun.

43:19.253 --> 43:20.853
I was gonna do
my belly button, but they

43:20.853 --> 43:22.213
bet me ten bucks
to do my tongue.

43:22.213 --> 43:23.613
Well, I'll give you 20 bucks
to take it out.

43:23.613 --> 43:25.613
Tony.

43:27.173 --> 43:28.893
Listen, I want you
to take that out

43:28.893 --> 43:30.333
before you go back
to school on Monday.

43:32.012 --> 43:33.492
Fine.

43:42.172 --> 43:43.812
I think you're overreacting.

43:43.812 --> 43:46.412
I know this is weird.

43:46.412 --> 43:48.372
You know, and it's weird
for me, too,

43:48.372 --> 43:51.092
but do me a favour.
Next time you think

43:51.092 --> 43:54.852
about piercing something else
on your body or...

43:54.852 --> 43:57.292
if you want to talk about sex,

43:57.292 --> 43:59.932
then you come to me, OK?

43:59.932 --> 44:01.612
Cos I'm here for you.

44:07.012 --> 44:08.772
I'll just wait
over here.

44:08.772 --> 44:10.732
All right, give
me a minute.

44:19.972 --> 44:22.132
You know, it killed me

44:22.132 --> 44:24.852
to put her
in a nursing home.

44:26.692 --> 44:28.812
After a while,
I couldn't deny

44:28.812 --> 44:31.372
that she put the eggs
in the hamper,

44:31.372 --> 44:33.652
ice in the microwave.

44:33.652 --> 44:35.732
Alzheimer's is hard.

44:35.732 --> 44:37.572
It kills you.

44:37.572 --> 44:39.612
She doesn't remember me
half the time. And him?

44:41.092 --> 44:43.252
He can't even
help out.

44:46.852 --> 44:49.052
His blood alcohol
level came back.

44:49.052 --> 44:52.412
It was zero.

44:52.412 --> 44:54.692
None detected.

44:57.132 --> 45:00.092
The other driver ran a
red light, Mr Holmes.

45:02.012 --> 45:04.372
Now, I know your son's
made mistakes in the past,

45:04.372 --> 45:06.252
but let him show you
that he's changed.

45:06.252 --> 45:08.931
He's trying.

45:14.851 --> 45:16.691
How is she?
The surgery went well.

45:16.691 --> 45:19.131
And we were able to repair
her pulmonary artery and vein.

45:19.131 --> 45:20.731
Good... that's
good, right?

45:20.731 --> 45:23.491
I mean, at her age,
her rehab could be a while,

45:23.491 --> 45:25.531
but she's already
starting to wake up.

45:25.531 --> 45:27.011
Thank God.

45:28.131 --> 45:29.771
When can I...

45:31.691 --> 45:33.571
when can we see her?

45:33.571 --> 45:35.851
Come on, I'll take you to Recovery.

45:49.171 --> 45:50.891
That seems like a cause
for a celebration.

45:53.531 --> 45:55.451
Bringing Up Baby
is playing at the Limelight.

45:55.451 --> 45:57.371
We should... we should go.

45:57.371 --> 46:00.171
I... can't.
I'm working here late.

46:00.171 --> 46:02.491
Or we could, we could
grab a quick coffee

46:02.491 --> 46:04.091
at the Jumbo mart.

46:06.851 --> 46:08.451
Think of it as an olive branch.

46:11.011 --> 46:13.371
All right, coffee it is.
Great.

46:13.371 --> 46:16.211
I will meet you
out front in one hour.

46:21.851 --> 46:23.731
It's a good thing
you weren't seriously hurt.

46:23.731 --> 46:26.571
Been a few muggings recently in
the area that didn't end so well.

46:26.571 --> 46:27.811
How much time
will he get for this?

46:27.811 --> 46:29.771
Depends on his priors.

46:29.771 --> 46:32.011
You'll be called for a court date.
I don't have time for court.

46:32.011 --> 46:34.011
Unless he takes a deal,

46:34.011 --> 46:35.771
it's the only way
we can put him behind bars.

46:35.771 --> 46:37.451
Here.

46:37.451 --> 46:40.051
If you have any questions...
call me.

46:40.051 --> 46:41.450
Thanks.

46:43.970 --> 46:45.250
How you doing?

46:46.730 --> 46:48.210
I'm fine, Dr Morris.

46:48.210 --> 46:50.610
You know,
I don't get it.

46:52.330 --> 46:54.290
You get mugged,
you beat him up.

46:54.290 --> 46:56.530
You're injured, but you still
go through the day.

46:56.530 --> 46:59.290
I don't buckle,
Dr Morris.

46:59.290 --> 47:00.890
OK.

47:00.890 --> 47:03.770
Sometimes you might want
to give yourself a break.

47:03.770 --> 47:04.730
No.

47:04.730 --> 47:07.650
Cos then I might have
to give someone else one.

47:13.650 --> 47:16.410
DOOR OPENS

47:16.410 --> 47:18.050
Just wait outside for me.

47:18.050 --> 47:19.930
Mm-hmm, sure.

47:21.930 --> 47:23.210
So how you doing, Claire?

47:23.210 --> 47:25.570
I'm fine.

47:25.570 --> 47:28.970
You know, you never told me
what grade you were in.

47:28.970 --> 47:31.170
Sixth.

47:31.170 --> 47:33.050
What do you think
of school?

47:33.050 --> 47:35.010
It's boring.

47:37.530 --> 47:39.490
You know, some kids,
when they're bored,

47:39.490 --> 47:41.130
they cut class.

47:41.130 --> 47:42.770
I've never
done that.

47:42.770 --> 47:45.130
Your mom said you did.

47:48.010 --> 47:50.090
School's a waste of time.

47:50.090 --> 47:52.010
I'm smarter
than most of the teachers.

47:52.010 --> 47:56.370
(CHUCKLES) How do you
and your sister get along?

47:56.370 --> 47:58.450
OK.

47:59.890 --> 48:02.730
She thinks she's going
to the Olympics.

48:02.730 --> 48:06.330
What happens when you fight?

48:06.330 --> 48:09.210
My sister and I
always fought.

48:10.850 --> 48:14.050
It really sucks
cos she's always right.

48:14.050 --> 48:16.449
She's little
Miss Perfect,

48:16.449 --> 48:20.529
and even if she starts it,
my mom always sides with her.

48:20.529 --> 48:22.489
That must bug you.

48:22.489 --> 48:24.129
It's every day.

48:24.129 --> 48:26.009
If she breaks a plate,
it's because I bumped into her.

48:26.009 --> 48:28.609
How do you get back
at someone for doing that?

48:30.289 --> 48:32.689
Teach her a lesson.

48:32.689 --> 48:34.289
By doing what?

48:37.249 --> 48:38.529
Nothing.

48:38.529 --> 48:40.049
Are you sure?

48:44.729 --> 48:47.489
Claire, we have video cameras

48:47.489 --> 48:49.489
in the ceilings
of our trauma rooms.

48:49.489 --> 48:51.849
We saw you adjust
the ventilator

48:51.849 --> 48:53.449
and light the sheet
on fire.

48:56.289 --> 48:57.849
I didn't want
to kill her.

49:01.489 --> 49:04.089
I just wanted to mess her up.

49:04.089 --> 49:06.409
You did?

49:06.409 --> 49:09.089
If she's in
the hospital,

49:09.089 --> 49:11.929
Mom will see what
a good girl I am.

49:13.249 --> 49:15.529
She won't be blaming me
for everything.

49:15.529 --> 49:17.249
Is that why you pushed her
off the wall?

49:23.089 --> 49:25.049
Claire,

49:25.049 --> 49:27.929
they're accusing your mother
of child abuse,

49:27.929 --> 49:30.129
which means
she could go to jail

49:30.129 --> 49:33.609
and your sister and you
could both go to foster homes.

49:33.609 --> 49:36.929
Now... something tells me

49:36.929 --> 49:39.569
that she doesn't hit you two,

49:39.569 --> 49:42.249
and she didn't
push your sister.

49:45.689 --> 49:47.689
Did you do it, Claire?

49:52.128 --> 49:53.368
Did you?

50:01.688 --> 50:03.768
It was cool seeing her
lying there

50:03.768 --> 50:07.488
all pale with blood coming out,

50:07.488 --> 50:09.488
and then when
she couldn't move

50:09.488 --> 50:12.168
and her legs
were getting burned,

50:13.768 --> 50:16.208
it was great.

50:16.208 --> 50:18.008
That made you feel good?

50:18.008 --> 50:20.048
Really good.

50:21.808 --> 50:23.808
Hmm.

50:25.088 --> 50:26.128
Well...

50:27.608 --> 50:30.288
it'll probably be better

50:30.288 --> 50:33.288
if you stay in the hospital
for a while.

50:33.288 --> 50:34.328
Why?

50:34.328 --> 50:35.808
I'm not sick.

50:37.768 --> 50:40.888
We just think
it would be a good idea.

50:46.088 --> 50:47.168
No.

50:48.568 --> 50:50.008
I won't.

50:52.288 --> 50:53.728
I won't!

50:53.728 --> 50:55.328
Wha...

50:55.328 --> 50:57.608
No, I won't!

50:57.608 --> 50:59.728
I won't! I won't!

50:59.728 --> 51:01.608
Claire, Claire!
No!

51:01.608 --> 51:03.568
Mommy!
Call the psych ward!

51:03.568 --> 51:05.808
Mommy, we can hang out now
that Julie is in the hospital.

51:05.808 --> 51:09.008
All right, Claire,
relax, all right.
No! Mommy!

51:09.008 --> 51:10.488
Come on.
Mommy, help me!

51:10.488 --> 51:12.208
Let us take care of her,
Ms O'Fallon.

51:12.208 --> 51:13.248
Relax.

51:13.248 --> 51:14.688
Get off of me!

51:14.688 --> 51:16.768
.5 of Haldol, Ativan.

51:17.848 --> 51:20.528
Get the hard restraints.
It's just for a short time, right?

51:20.528 --> 51:22.328
Then I can take her home soon.
She'll be all right.

51:22.328 --> 51:24.088
I will kill you!

51:24.088 --> 51:26.608
I will kill you!

51:26.608 --> 51:28.567
I will kill you!

51:28.567 --> 51:32.607
I'm going to cut you up
into little pieces!

51:32.607 --> 51:35.727
I can't remember the last time
we did a right-sided thoracotomy.

51:35.727 --> 51:37.207
That guy's lucky
to be alive.

51:37.207 --> 51:39.687
Well, I, uh, lost
a trucker in Sydney

51:39.687 --> 51:41.967
with a right
hilar tear.

51:41.967 --> 51:43.687
You miss it once,
you never forget.

51:43.687 --> 51:45.567
I guess you're right.

51:49.127 --> 51:52.807
We should go, uh,
salsa dancing sometime.

51:54.207 --> 51:55.647
How do you know I like
dancing and old comedies?

51:55.647 --> 51:58.247
I do my research.

51:58.247 --> 52:00.567
We're just going
to be friends.

52:01.887 --> 52:04.487
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

52:04.487 --> 52:06.327
What... you mean
sleeping with me?

52:06.327 --> 52:10.087
An awkward shag...
on a horrible day

52:10.087 --> 52:13.367
doesn't count...
as "sleeping with you."

52:13.367 --> 52:14.687
It counts as poor judgment.

52:14.687 --> 52:16.887
You romantic fool.

52:16.887 --> 52:19.727
I thought we fit
well together.

52:23.127 --> 52:24.087
OK.

52:25.247 --> 52:26.727
All right.

52:26.727 --> 52:29.967
I'm not going to hound you.
I'm not going to beg.

52:29.967 --> 52:32.607
But one day you will
wake up next to me

52:32.607 --> 52:33.727
and you're
going to wonder

52:33.727 --> 52:36.087
"How did this happen?"

52:36.087 --> 52:38.447
and I'm going to smile
and remind you

52:38.447 --> 52:39.527
that I predicted this

52:39.527 --> 52:42.567
over coffees
and chocolate-glazed doughnuts.

52:42.567 --> 52:45.167
You're a cocky bastard.

52:45.167 --> 52:46.487
Yeah, but I will
be a correct...

52:46.487 --> 52:48.927
cocky bastard, and that's
all that will matter.

52:51.407 --> 52:53.487
You ready to go?

53:01.767 --> 53:03.846
Are you all right?

53:03.846 --> 53:06.966
Oh, Claire left her coat
down here.

53:09.646 --> 53:11.766
You know, about
a month ago,

53:11.766 --> 53:15.926
I, uh, I caught her throwing
rocks at the neighbour's dog,

53:15.926 --> 53:19.486
and then a few days later,
she was trying to stick

53:19.486 --> 53:22.886
a metal rod through one
of the fish in our tank.

53:24.166 --> 53:26.566
And I just tried to
pretend it was normal--

53:26.566 --> 53:28.846
you know, just
a kid acting out.

53:30.046 --> 53:32.366
I don't get it.

53:32.366 --> 53:34.246
Why her? Why our family?

53:35.086 --> 53:37.206
I don't know.

53:42.006 --> 53:44.646
That's all you can say?

53:44.646 --> 53:46.806
You can't
lie to me

53:46.806 --> 53:50.326
and tell me that
she's going to be OK,

53:50.326 --> 53:52.766
that she's going to grow up
to be a normal girl?

53:52.766 --> 53:57.526
I mean, that's why we come here:
to get answers.

53:58.646 --> 54:01.406
You're going to have
to do better than that.

54:02.726 --> 54:06.086
I'm sorry. That's all I have.

54:10.646 --> 54:13.166
Well, that's not good enough,
doctor.

54:18.086 --> 54:19.926
That's not good enough.

54:44.165 --> 54:45.805
VOICES ECHO, ALARMS BLEEP

54:45.805 --> 54:47.445
FEMALE NURSE:
Ceftriaxone's in.

54:47.445 --> 54:49.325
Then run fluids at 100 an hour.

54:49.325 --> 54:50.965
Prep some atropine.

54:50.965 --> 54:52.805
Epi's in.
Sats 91 on 100%.

54:52.805 --> 54:55.605
Come on. Come on, Daryl!

55:02.525 --> 55:03.925
PADDLES ZAP

55:03.925 --> 55:06.045
When we will know
if it's working?

55:06.045 --> 55:08.085
we have no choice.
Clear!

55:08.085 --> 55:12.605
FLATLINE TONE BEEPS

55:16.525 --> 55:18.005
(SNIFFLES, SIGHS)

01:00:27.682 --> 01:00:30.402
'Previously...' What's this?
My letter of resignation.

01:00:30.402 --> 01:00:32.442
I hate this part of you.
Nora, that's enough.

01:00:32.442 --> 01:00:35.962
The very thing you like least about
Kitty is the thing I love most.

01:00:35.962 --> 01:00:38.082
I want it to be different
with you.

01:00:38.082 --> 01:00:42.482
William had another lover, and
they had a child together. Ryan.

01:00:42.482 --> 01:00:45.122
We were impressed at the meeting.
We're keeping an eye on you.

01:00:45.122 --> 01:00:47.882
Will Robert really make you
quit if you publish?

01:00:47.882 --> 01:00:51.042
I certainly can't work with people
that I wrote a book about.

01:00:51.042 --> 01:00:55.682
When you're ready to have a real
relationship with me, I'll be here.

01:00:55.682 --> 01:00:57.762
It doesn't feel like
our company any more.

01:00:57.762 --> 01:00:59.562
I'm quitting.

01:00:59.562 --> 01:01:01.921
I was trying to find
Ryan Lafferty.

01:01:01.921 --> 01:01:03.641
Not a problem.

01:01:04.601 --> 01:01:07.321
I talked to Ruth Gavin
yesterday from Downtown Arts,

01:01:07.321 --> 01:01:09.241
and she told me
everything I need to know

01:01:09.241 --> 01:01:11.121
about starting up
a non-profit,

01:01:11.121 --> 01:01:13.361
so welcome
to the nerve centre.

01:01:13.361 --> 01:01:15.441
Nerve centre.
I could--I could see that.

01:01:15.441 --> 01:01:17.441
She told me I need space

01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:19.721
where I can
talk to potential donors,

01:01:19.721 --> 01:01:23.041
interview volunteers, begin
to write proposals and grants.

01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:24.801
And I need lines -
three telephone lines -

01:01:24.801 --> 01:01:27.641
a printer that copies,
or a copier that prints.

01:01:27.641 --> 01:01:29.721
I-I haven't even
raised a dime.

01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:32.681
I'll be in debt before I begin!
Breathe! Everything'll be OK.

01:01:32.681 --> 01:01:34.841
I'm breathing. I'm breathing.
All right? OK.

01:01:34.841 --> 01:01:36.921
OK. First things first...
Uh-huh?

01:01:36.921 --> 01:01:39.881
I want all this stuff out of here.
OK, what do you want to go?

01:01:39.881 --> 01:01:43.841
The couch, the chair, the lamp,
the desk, the globe...
Wait, Dad's desk?

01:01:43.841 --> 01:01:45.841
He's not using it.

01:01:45.841 --> 01:01:48.441
Oh. I-I just figured
that maybe you'd want to.

01:01:48.441 --> 01:01:51.361
No. It's not me. It's this big,
clunky George Washington thing.

01:01:51.361 --> 01:01:53.601
I want it light and airy
in here, not a book-lined tomb.
