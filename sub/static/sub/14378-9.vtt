00:47.100 --> 00:48.366
Hurry up, you fools,

00:48.400 --> 00:50.233
before it is too late!

00:50.266 --> 00:51.283
Unhand that loot, claw,

00:51.316 --> 00:54.016
or the justice friends
will be forced

00:54.050 --> 00:56.150
to deal you a bad hand!

00:56.183 --> 00:59.266
Right on, major glory!

00:59.300 --> 01:03.133
Dude, val hallen doth agree!

01:03.166 --> 01:04.116
Yes!

01:04.150 --> 01:05.133
Meow!

01:05.166 --> 01:06.466
Run!

01:07.016 --> 01:08.233

01:09.150 --> 01:10.266

01:10.300 --> 01:11.200

[Hisses]

01:15.016 --> 01:17.033
Aah!

01:22.116 --> 01:23.333
Wow!

01:54.033 --> 01:55.000
Boy, oh boy!

01:55.033 --> 01:57.433
What an amazing
adventure that was!

01:57.466 --> 02:00.133
I can not wait
for the next great

02:00.166 --> 02:02.433
<i>justice friends</i>
comic book to come out.

02:02.466 --> 02:04.233
I am sure the next issue

02:04.266 --> 02:06.450
will have an even more
powerful super-villain

02:06.483 --> 02:09.450
trying to destroy
the justice friends.

02:09.483 --> 02:13.366
Halt, for the justice friends
are here!

02:13.400 --> 02:14.333
Pow!

02:14.366 --> 02:15.250
Judo chop!

02:15.283 --> 02:17.300
And then the whoosh!

02:18.416 --> 02:20.416
I do not think I can
wait a whole month

02:20.450 --> 02:23.183
for the next issue
to come out.

02:23.216 --> 02:26.016
Wait. I do not
have to wait.

02:26.050 --> 02:28.100
I am Dexter!

02:28.133 --> 02:32.466
I will make my own
comic book adventure.

02:45.383 --> 02:47.266
This stinks!

02:47.300 --> 02:49.250
I cannot draw!

02:49.283 --> 02:50.316
What!

02:50.350 --> 02:52.316
I do not have to draw!

02:52.350 --> 02:56.283
Let the science begin!

03:32.450 --> 03:34.016
Yes.

03:34.050 --> 03:35.333
Yes!

03:35.366 --> 03:37.166
Yes!

03:37.200 --> 03:42.433
At last, the curvitron 2000
is completed!

03:44.300 --> 03:48.150
Now, what adventure
do I want to read first?

03:48.183 --> 03:49.100
Wait a second.

03:49.133 --> 03:50.433
What adventure
could be better

03:50.466 --> 03:53.050
to read about
than my own!

03:53.083 --> 03:57.183
Comic book history,
here I come!

04:03.283 --> 04:06.266
Ooh!

04:07.050 --> 04:09.383
Narrator: In a world
where heroes have disappeared

04:09.416 --> 04:14.150
and evil has run amok,
one man has stepped forth

04:14.183 --> 04:15.316
to defend the innocent.

04:15.350 --> 04:17.000
When an emergency calls,

04:17.033 --> 04:20.350
this hero mysteriously appears
from his secret laboratory.

04:20.383 --> 04:22.483
He is known only as...

04:29.416 --> 04:32.216
Wow, my very own narrator!

04:32.250 --> 04:35.033
Wow, word balloons!

04:35.066 --> 04:37.166
And look at all my muscles!

04:37.200 --> 04:39.116
Wow!

04:39.383 --> 04:41.400
Super strength!

04:44.016 --> 04:45.283
I can fly!

04:48.333 --> 04:50.433
Laser vision!

04:50.466 --> 04:52.266
Narrator: But,
unbeknownst to Dexter,

04:52.300 --> 04:55.233
a strange figure
lurks about the lab.

04:55.266 --> 04:56.366
My super sense?

04:56.400 --> 04:58.183
Hello, Dexter.

04:58.216 --> 05:01.100
I am deestructa!

05:02.216 --> 05:04.250
Einstein's ghost!

05:04.283 --> 05:06.300
Wow, this is so cool!

05:06.333 --> 05:08.400
I can not believe
I get to fight

05:08.433 --> 05:10.416
my very own
super-villain!

05:10.450 --> 05:13.116
And she is pure evil.

05:13.150 --> 05:14.400
I can feel it!

05:14.433 --> 05:15.300
Stop!

05:15.333 --> 05:18.016
Do not push
that button!

05:18.350 --> 05:21.300
Halt this senseless
destruction, deestructa!

05:21.333 --> 05:24.283
Or feel the wrath of Dexter,

05:24.316 --> 05:27.216
super being of science!

05:27.250 --> 05:30.016
You'll have to
catch me first.

05:30.050 --> 05:33.266
Her speed and agility
are great, but...

05:34.100 --> 05:35.366
I can fly!

05:39.300 --> 05:40.283
Gotcha!

05:40.316 --> 05:42.083
Not quite!

05:54.033 --> 05:55.100
Her power is too great!

05:55.133 --> 05:57.366
My laboratory does
not have much time!

05:57.400 --> 06:02.066
It would take 5 times
my own power to stop her.

06:02.100 --> 06:02.433
Wait!

06:02.466 --> 06:03.416
That's it!

06:03.450 --> 06:05.200
Narrator:
Using his super science,

06:05.233 --> 06:09.116
Dexter initializes
his multi-maker.

06:11.133 --> 06:13.250
Dexters, attack!

06:15.016 --> 06:16.450
Where did all
of you come from?

06:16.483 --> 06:19.383
Clone: We are here
from the super
genius of Dexter

06:19.416 --> 06:23.000
to stop your
destruction,
deestructa!

06:46.050 --> 06:47.166
We have got her!

06:47.200 --> 06:49.383
You cannot escape us!

06:49.416 --> 06:51.400
It is pointless
to resist!

06:51.433 --> 06:54.283
You have been
defeated by Dexter!

06:54.316 --> 06:56.150
Deestructa: Never!

07:31.383 --> 07:34.016
[Screams]

07:42.133 --> 07:44.366
Narrator: Dulled with
radioactive gamma rays,

07:44.400 --> 07:49.116
Dexter, super being of science,
transforms into...

07:57.400 --> 08:00.266
Dexter, the infragable bulk!

08:00.300 --> 08:03.083
[Roars]

08:19.200 --> 08:21.316
Ha, deestructa!

08:21.350 --> 08:25.100
Now you have
no place to hide!

08:25.133 --> 08:29.133
Precisely my plan,
you bulking buffoon!

08:30.483 --> 08:33.033
My laboratory!

08:33.066 --> 08:36.383
My poor
laboratory!

08:36.416 --> 08:39.166
[Crying]

08:42.083 --> 08:44.183
And now, to unveil
who is was

08:44.216 --> 08:46.200
that destroyed
you and your lab.

08:46.233 --> 08:50.000
I will reveal
my true identity.

08:50.033 --> 08:52.016
Galloping grasshoppers!

08:52.050 --> 08:54.250
It cannot be!

08:55.383 --> 08:58.416
Dexter: Dee Dee!

10:48.200 --> 10:50.466
[Cracking]

10:58.283 --> 11:01.016
[Cracking]

12:05.166 --> 12:07.433
[Thunder]

12:13.116 --> 12:14.133
Ah, well.

12:14.166 --> 12:17.150
I guess we'll have
to try again next week.

12:42.366 --> 12:44.300
Dexter: You lousy tin can!

12:44.333 --> 12:47.150
Boy, talk about obsolete!

12:47.183 --> 12:48.433
Hunk of junk!

12:48.466 --> 12:52.050
Worthless, worthless!

12:52.083 --> 12:53.350
Worthless.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.333
Ahhh!

13:00.100 --> 13:01.050
That's it!

13:01.083 --> 13:02.250
I've had it!

13:02.283 --> 13:05.166
It is time to move on...

13:08.366 --> 13:11.233
To the future.

13:14.133 --> 13:17.116
I will build the most advanced,

13:17.150 --> 13:19.166
most powerful,

13:19.200 --> 13:23.250
most intelligent robot ever.

13:24.066 --> 13:28.100
Well, at least you
are still good for something.

13:28.133 --> 13:29.400
Come on,

13:29.433 --> 13:32.150
last nut.

13:46.383 --> 13:48.000
At last.

13:48.033 --> 13:50.350
My most ultimate creation!

13:50.383 --> 13:51.266
The most powerful,

13:51.300 --> 13:55.050
most intelligent robot ever!

13:55.083 --> 13:57.400
Robot: Robo dexo 3000.

13:57.433 --> 14:00.133
That's right!

14:00.166 --> 14:02.466
Full power, on!

14:09.350 --> 14:13.083
Robo dexo 3000, go!

14:14.133 --> 14:17.100
Commence the exercise.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.266
Yahoo!

14:34.083 --> 14:36.183
Super samurai action!

14:36.216 --> 14:38.333
But this action
is so much cooler

14:38.366 --> 14:42.233
than my old, stupid
robo dexo 2000.

14:42.266 --> 14:44.100
Affirmative!

14:44.133 --> 14:46.016
Action!

14:46.416 --> 14:48.216
Fix-fix! Fix-fix! Fix-fix!

14:48.250 --> 14:51.050
Fix, fix, fix, fix,
fix, fix, fix, fix,

14:51.083 --> 14:53.233
fix, fix, fix, fix, fix.

14:53.266 --> 14:56.033
Fix, fix, fix, fix?

14:58.016 --> 15:00.100
Fix, fix, fix, fix.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.133
Fix, fix!

15:10.316 --> 15:14.250
Fix-fix-fix! Fix-fix-fix!
Fix-fix-fix! Fix-fix-fix!

15:14.283 --> 15:16.100
You rule!

15:16.133 --> 15:17.316
Affirmative!

15:17.350 --> 15:18.333
I rule!

15:18.366 --> 15:20.416
You are quite simply
the most powerful,

15:20.450 --> 15:25.016
the most intelligent
robot ever created.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.316
I am the most powerful robot.

15:27.350 --> 15:30.333
I am the most
intelligent robot.

15:30.366 --> 15:34.166
I am the most powerful robot.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.133
Computer, what is happening?

16:27.166 --> 16:29.400
Computer:
Scanning...

16:29.433 --> 16:31.366
Dexter, there
is an energy thief

16:31.400 --> 16:34.150
attacking the world's
power sources.

16:34.183 --> 16:37.433
To the robo dexo 3000!

16:39.250 --> 16:40.416
With this brain wave-ilator,

16:40.450 --> 16:45.483
I can just mentally program
my clever plan into you.

16:46.416 --> 16:48.116
Well, what do you think?

16:48.150 --> 16:49.466
Pretty good, huh?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.183
Negative.

16:51.216 --> 16:52.100
What?

16:52.133 --> 16:53.300
I do not agree.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.333
Your plan will
not succeed.

16:55.366 --> 16:59.116
Robo dexo 3000
has a superior plan.

16:59.150 --> 17:02.466
Well, that is what
manual override is for.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Negative.

17:04.033 --> 17:07.166
Jettisoning unnecessary
organic matter.

17:07.200 --> 17:11.466
Hey! You cannot
evacuate me like that!

17:13.450 --> 17:16.183
But I made you.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.383
Oh.

17:21.066 --> 17:23.016
What was that?

17:23.050 --> 17:24.016
Fixed!

17:24.050 --> 17:26.433
All right,
what is going
on here?

17:26.466 --> 17:28.300
Whoa!

17:36.300 --> 17:38.250
Robo dexo 2000,

17:38.283 --> 17:40.083
you are as good as new.

17:40.116 --> 17:46.350
I am so sorry I built
that stupid robo dexo 3000.

17:46.383 --> 17:49.216
Please forgive me.

17:52.116 --> 17:55.033
Let's go save the world!

17:59.300 --> 18:01.116
There they are.

18:09.116 --> 18:10.333
Wow!

18:18.116 --> 18:20.250
I am robo dexo 3000,

18:20.283 --> 18:24.133
the most powerful robot
in the world.

18:25.033 --> 18:28.466
I am the most intelligent--huh?

18:30.316 --> 18:35.050
A nut? I thought we
tightened all then nuts.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.233
Look out!

18:54.366 --> 18:58.266
Aw, no more
samurai action for you.

18:58.300 --> 19:01.383
Computer, where is
the thief headed now?

19:01.416 --> 19:03.366
Computer: It is
going to the desert.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.383
Robo dexo 2000,
I'm going to need

19:06.416 --> 19:10.016
all the power you've got!

19:28.466 --> 19:32.300
Stop right there,
energy thief!

19:34.083 --> 19:35.333
[Burps]

19:52.200 --> 19:54.083
Computer:
Power draining.

19:54.116 --> 19:56.283
Power at 50 percent.

19:56.316 --> 19:58.200
48 percent.

19:58.233 --> 20:00.466
44 percent.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.016
32 percent.

20:03.050 --> 20:05.283
20 percent.

20:05.316 --> 20:07.366
One percent
power remaining.

20:07.400 --> 20:12.000
Dexter, the energy thief
is in position.

20:12.033 --> 20:13.316
Initiating.

20:49.233 --> 20:53.450
Robo dexo 2000,
come here!

20:58.366 --> 21:02.200
Whoa, that worked out
just as I planned.

21:02.233 --> 21:08.200
Robo dexo 2000, you are
the greatest robot ever.

21:09.033 --> 21:12.083
