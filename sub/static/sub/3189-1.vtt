<i>If I'd known how everything
would turn out</i>

00:31.609 --> 00:35.060
<i>I'd have done it all
differently.</i>

00:40.592 --> 00:43.032
<i>I would have stayed invisible.</i>

00:43.033 --> 00:46.416
<i>A nobody.</i>

00:49.454 --> 00:52.404
<i>But I'm no longer a nobody.</i>

00:52.405 --> 00:56.452
<i>I'm one of the most wanted
hackers in the world.</i>

01:25.138 --> 01:28.003
<i>Who am I?</i>
<i>I am Benjamin.</i>

01:28.004 --> 01:31.099
<i>And this is my story.</i>

02:04.956 --> 02:06.667
He turned himself in an hour ago.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.648
He claims he's the hacker WHOAMI.

02:08.649 --> 02:11.534
He said he can lead us to FR13NDS
and the Russian cyber mafia

02:11.535 --> 02:14.274
He wants to talk only to you.

02:18.494 --> 02:22.170
And you are 'WHOAMI'?

02:24.745 --> 02:27.564
There's some reason why you're here.

02:28.285 --> 02:32.968
And why you got me here... So?

02:33.219 --> 02:35.224
<i>Everything is somehow connected.</i>

02:35.225 --> 02:38.769
<i>There's no one thread
with a beginning and an end.</i>

02:38.770 --> 02:40.975
<i>It's a tangle of threads</i>

02:40.976 --> 02:43.471
<i>And I'm caught in the middle.</i>

02:48.106 --> 02:49.848
<i>I always wanted to be a superhero</i>

02:49.849 --> 02:51.874
<i>with a superpower</i>

02:51.875 --> 02:54.964
<i>I wanted to do things
that nobody thought possible.</i>

02:54.965 --> 02:57.599
<i>In reality I already had
a superpower</i>

02:57.600 --> 02:59.911
<i>I was invisible.</i>

02:59.912 --> 03:04.537
<i>I even had a superhero costume.</i>
- Paradise Pizza: the end of the rainbow

03:04.538 --> 03:07.330
<i>Every superhero needs
a tragic family story:</i>

03:07.331 --> 03:10.204
<i>Spiderman's parents... Dead.</i>

03:10.205 --> 03:12.946
<i>Batman's parents... Murdered.</i>

03:12.947 --> 03:15.683
<i>Superman's parents... Exploded.</i>

03:15.684 --> 03:19.106
<i>I actually had the best requirements</i>

03:19.244 --> 03:22.378
<i>My father ran away to France
when I was born.</i>

03:22.379 --> 03:24.571
<i>I've never met him.</i>

03:24.572 --> 03:27.929
<i>A similarity that I share
with my grandma.</i>

03:27.930 --> 03:31.229
<i>Her father died
in the Second World War</i>

03:31.230 --> 03:33.200
<i>The only memory she has of him</i>

03:33.201 --> 03:38.404
<i>are three bullet casings
his buddy brought back from Russia</i>

03:45.158 --> 03:48.611
<i>My mom took her own life
when I was 8.</i>

03:48.649 --> 03:52.282
<i>The best material for a hero story.</i>

03:52.448 --> 03:54.701
<i>My grandma took care of me</i>

03:54.702 --> 03:57.035
<i>and later I took care of her.</i>

03:57.587 --> 03:59.551
I'm not a psychologist.

03:59.552 --> 04:01.989
I'm not interested in your traumas.

04:01.990 --> 04:04.060
What do you know about CLAY?

04:04.061 --> 04:07.628
About your alliance with 'FR13NDS'?

04:08.422 --> 04:11.589
Everything you want to know.

04:17.107 --> 04:20.406
<i>But every detail is important.</i>

04:24.386 --> 04:27.086
<i>Hacking is like magic</i>

04:28.081 --> 04:32.048
<i>They're both about deceiving others.</i>

04:32.481 --> 04:36.185
<i>Since I was 14 I spent my time
in front of the PC.</i>

04:36.186 --> 04:40.292
<i>I learned programming languages,</i>
<i>hacked my first system;</i>

04:40.293 --> 04:43.532
<i>a universe of infinite possibilities.</i>

04:43.533 --> 04:47.238
<i>For the first time I felt like
I was good at something.</i>

04:47.239 --> 04:49.899
<i>In real life I was
an Omega among Alphas .</i>

04:49.900 --> 04:53.351
<i>An outsider, a loser,</i>
<i>a freak.</i>

04:53.352 --> 04:56.652
<i>But on the net, I felt I belonged.</i>

05:01.722 --> 05:04.158
<i>A refuge for people like me.</i>

05:04.159 --> 05:07.526
<i>While everyone else wasted
their time on the World-Wide-Web</i>

05:07.527 --> 05:11.796
<i>we met in the so-called Darknet,</i>
<i>the net within the net.</i>

05:11.797 --> 05:15.120
<i>Here I could be whoever I wanted.</i>

05:15.121 --> 05:18.217
<i>I spent days and nights online.</i>

05:18.218 --> 05:21.584
<i>I got my sleep in the real world.</i>

05:21.594 --> 05:23.825
<i>But there was an antidote</i>

05:23.826 --> 05:26.716
I got the idea from my biggest idol.

05:26.717 --> 05:29.199
<i>There are a lot of
great hackers out there.</i>

05:29.200 --> 05:32.215
<i>But only one true hero for me.</i>

05:32.216 --> 05:34.812
<i>He called himself MRX.</i>

05:34.813 --> 05:38.136
<i>He is from nowhere.</i>
<i>No one knew who he was.</i>

05:38.137 --> 05:41.730
<i>He could hack into any system.</i>
<i>He was the star of the scene.</i>

05:41.731 --> 05:45.691
<i>One of his most famous hacks
was a social network attack</i>

05:45.692 --> 05:48.481
<i>He didn't take anything
or anyone seriously.</i>

05:48.482 --> 05:52.847
<i>He was THE superhero among hackers.</i>
<i>I wanted to be like him.</i>

05:52.848 --> 05:58.375
<i>And he exploited an online</i>
<i>pharmacy to get Ritalin;</i>

05:58.376 --> 06:01.070
<i>the hacker's waker-upper.</i>

06:01.071 --> 06:03.070
MRX had 3 rules:

06:03.071 --> 06:05.899
1st: no system is safe.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.148
2nd: aim for the impossible.

06:08.149 --> 06:11.174
3rd: Have fun in cyberspace
and meatspace.

06:11.175 --> 06:15.814
In other words, don't limit your fun
to only the virtual world.

06:15.815 --> 06:18.603
<i>But the real reason I'm here now</i>

06:18.604 --> 06:22.356
<i>why it all ened up like this
is Marie.</i>

06:22.373 --> 06:25.349
Hey! Resting's never got anyone anywhere.

06:25.350 --> 06:29.633
Hope is the rainbow
over the waterfall of our life.

06:29.634 --> 06:32.001
You wanna pass the exam?

06:32.002 --> 06:33.317
Try learning!

06:33.318 --> 06:35.993
Or do you hope someone will steal
the exam questions for you?

06:35.994 --> 06:39.761
I called Superman but he had no time.

06:39.841 --> 06:41.563
Shush yourself!

06:41.617 --> 06:43.317
Spazz!

06:44.499 --> 06:46.199
What kind of weirdo bird are you?

06:46.200 --> 06:47.427
Paradise Pizza

06:47.428 --> 06:49.913
The end of the rain...bow.

06:49.914 --> 06:53.709
<i>During highschool I was
desperately in love with Marie.</i>

06:53.710 --> 06:59.410
<i>But after ten years no one remembers
the freak from the last row.</i>

06:59.411 --> 07:00.791
Yes, again today!

07:02.197 --> 07:04.657
- Clear the table!
- Finally something rational.

07:04.658 --> 07:07.211
I had Salami.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.761
That'll be 34,28.

07:10.945 --> 07:14.507
Hey, spaz, I said no anchovy!
I'm not paying for this.

07:14.508 --> 07:16.709
Don't be an ass, Oscar!

07:16.710 --> 07:19.824
He always does this. Keep the change.
- Are you crazy?

07:19.825 --> 07:22.472
Mr. Anchovy will give you another 100

07:22.473 --> 07:25.740
if you get the exam questions;
Bachelor of Law.

07:26.520 --> 07:28.955
The world doesn't need a savior

07:28.956 --> 07:32.696
but everyday I hear people
crying for one.

07:32.697 --> 07:36.749
- What?
-That's from Superman.

07:41.383 --> 07:44.906
It's okay. Thanks.

07:45.367 --> 07:49.326
- You're such an ass!
- How about that for a freak?

07:49.327 --> 07:52.036
<i>I would finally be a superhero.</i>

07:52.037 --> 07:55.195
<i>Marie had a problem</i>
<i>and I could solve it.</i>

07:55.196 --> 07:58.227
<i>I just had to get her
the exam questions.</i>

07:58.228 --> 08:00.419
<i>She'd remember me,
We'd fall in love</i>

08:00.420 --> 08:02.333
<i>get married, have kids,</i>

08:02.334 --> 08:05.234
<i>be happy together. Bingo.</i>

08:09.869 --> 08:15.923
<i>The bachelor exams were stored on
the university's central server</i>

08:15.924 --> 08:18.795
<i>I just needed access.</i>

08:18.796 --> 08:21.429
<i>It was almost too easy.</i>

08:22.053 --> 08:25.361
<i>Most of the hackers just
crack the threshold,</i>

08:25.362 --> 08:29.004
<i>look around the system
and don't change a thing</i>

08:29.005 --> 08:31.572
<i>Others leave a note.</i>

08:31.645 --> 08:34.611
<i>And many, take a souvenir.</i>

08:41.537 --> 08:45.037
<i>I was Superman, Spiderman, Batman</i>

08:45.421 --> 08:47.264
What are you doing there?

08:47.265 --> 08:49.565
<i>I was an idiot.</i>

08:49.898 --> 08:53.464
No entries, no previous conviction

08:53.942 --> 08:57.212
50 hours of community service.
Do something with your life!

08:57.213 --> 08:59.513
It's up to you!

09:07.505 --> 09:13.738
<i>My 50 hours of community service meant
cleaning a city I didn't care about</i>

09:15.297 --> 09:18.263
<i>It couldn't be any worse.</i>

09:18.939 --> 09:22.572
<i>Not even the Ritalin worked anymore.</i>

09:23.506 --> 09:27.939
<i>But everything was about to
change in one fell swoop.</i>

09:40.212 --> 09:42.979
So, why are you here?

09:45.635 --> 09:48.535
Can't you speak, or what?

09:50.511 --> 09:52.811
Then don't.

09:54.232 --> 09:56.500
Let me guess...

09:56.501 --> 09:59.212
you're the type who thinks
life's unfair to them,

09:59.213 --> 10:02.369
who feels ignored all the time,
like the refuse of society.

10:02.370 --> 10:04.027
In school you weren't even beaten up

10:04.028 --> 10:08.645
because nobody gave a rat's ass
about you. All very, very sad.

10:08.646 --> 10:10.601
Y'know what I think?

10:10.602 --> 10:13.502
It's bullshit. A scam.

10:15.937 --> 10:18.437
Computer stuff.

10:21.144 --> 10:23.444
And you?

10:27.222 --> 10:29.522
This and that.

10:29.812 --> 10:31.745
What's your thing, huh?

10:31.746 --> 10:33.861
DDoS attacks?
Botnets?

10:33.862 --> 10:36.162
Phishing?

10:36.573 --> 10:38.826
Or are you just a script kiddie?

10:38.827 --> 10:40.813
I hacked the University's server.

10:40.814 --> 10:43.001
How did you gain access?

10:43.002 --> 10:45.071
Using a zero-day exploit.

10:45.072 --> 10:48.583
You can read machine language?
Just like that?

10:48.584 --> 10:50.484
M-hm!

10:54.145 --> 10:56.445
I'm Max.

10:57.671 --> 10:59.805
Benjamin.

10:59.806 --> 11:02.166
Any plans for today?

11:02.167 --> 11:06.966
<i>I keep wondering if there was a moment
when all the threads converged.</i>

11:06.967 --> 11:10.934
<i>That moment which changes everything.</i>

11:11.021 --> 11:13.669
I'm the king of the world!

11:54.300 --> 11:55.299
Boo!

11:55.200 --> 11:58.045
The later the evening,
the drunker the guests.

11:58.046 --> 12:01.846
How do you like my modest
temple to decadence?

12:08.698 --> 12:11.474
I don't even know half these people.

12:11.475 --> 12:13.768
All fucking freeloaders!

12:13.769 --> 12:16.145
<i>Max was the total opposite of me</i>

12:16.146 --> 12:19.137
Self-confident, charismatic

12:19.138 --> 12:21.638
A winner

12:23.850 --> 12:26.150
Close the door!

12:28.439 --> 12:29.982
Krass.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.582
Cool office.

12:31.583 --> 12:34.756
Yeah, let me introduce you.
This is Benjamin.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.583
Stephan

12:44.584 --> 12:46.047
Benjamin

12:46.048 --> 12:47.524
Benjamin Engel.

12:47.525 --> 12:49.695
<i>Stephan was the software master</i>

12:49.696 --> 12:51.729
<i>He could find a bug in any program</i>

12:51.730 --> 12:54.003
<i>He's always been totally insane.</i>

12:54.004 --> 12:55.199
<i>He lived for kicks.</i>

12:55.200 --> 12:58.411
The wackier, the better.

12:59.863 --> 13:03.350
- No last names.
-<i>Paul was a total hardware freak</i>

13:03.351 --> 13:06.818
<i>Give him a paper clip and a motherboard
and he'll build you anything.</i>

13:06.819 --> 13:08.652
<i>Like me, he lost his mother early.</i>

13:08.653 --> 13:11.301
<i>His rich father shoved him in
a boarding school</i>

13:11.302 --> 13:13.802
<i>and devoted himself to
more important things.</i>

13:13.824 --> 13:16.850
Don't mind him, his smile
muscles were removed at birth.

13:16.851 --> 13:19.291
Max said you can read
machine language

13:19.303 --> 13:22.012
Machine language?
Anyone can say that!

13:22.013 --> 13:25.400
It's not something you can just
pull out of your ass!

13:25.401 --> 13:27.701
Prove it.

13:28.234 --> 13:32.170
Or you won't leave here alive
Engel.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.633
Jackpot!

14:11.525 --> 14:13.587
Paul.

14:13.588 --> 14:15.202
Benjamin.

14:15.203 --> 14:16.681
Just Benjamin.

14:16.682 --> 14:19.449
The fun really starts now!

14:21.261 --> 14:23.905
Shit!

14:26.229 --> 14:30.265
Don't worry, they're not here for that.

14:33.734 --> 14:37.035
What? Did you think I live here?

14:37.036 --> 14:38.936
Come on!

14:41.005 --> 14:44.973
Who's responsible for this Megaparty?

14:44.974 --> 14:48.183
- No idea.
- Come on. Make way!

14:51.886 --> 14:54.186
Make way!

14:57.683 --> 15:00.370
You're the Pizza Bird.

15:00.371 --> 15:03.204
Do you know each other?

15:03.905 --> 15:06.205
It's his party!

15:10.224 --> 15:12.524
What the fuck?

15:14.147 --> 15:16.745
You fuckers!

15:22.655 --> 15:24.548
GO!

15:25.283 --> 15:27.256
This way!

15:31.835 --> 15:34.135
No last names.

15:36.363 --> 15:39.235
I always stopped at warnings.

15:39.236 --> 15:42.669
Never asked again, after that.

15:43.914 --> 15:46.214
Stop! I can't go on.

15:46.215 --> 15:48.682
I can't take another step.

15:50.087 --> 15:52.486
See ya later. Come on!

15:52.487 --> 15:54.158
What?

15:57.796 --> 15:59.743
Now I remember you.

15:59.744 --> 16:02.711
Benjamin, Benjamin Engel!

16:03.141 --> 16:05.952
Our teacher forgot you
on a school trip,

16:05.953 --> 16:09.653
and you had to go home alone
by train.

16:13.862 --> 16:15.994
It's been interesting...

16:15.995 --> 16:18.515
...the evening.

16:18.775 --> 16:21.075
Bye.

16:22.538 --> 16:24.838
Bye.

17:21.287 --> 17:24.402
We all knew this day would come.

17:24.403 --> 17:27.715
Your grandma needs professional help.

17:27.717 --> 17:30.084
You must let go!

17:36.276 --> 17:39.376
She's in really good hands
here with us.

17:40.716 --> 17:45.071
<i>My grandma was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's 4 years ago.</i>

17:45.072 --> 17:50.439
<i>Every day an invisible eraser
erases more and more of her edges.</i>

18:12.300 --> 18:14.865
Tickets, please!

18:15.584 --> 18:18.617
I thought the cops still had you.

18:20.037 --> 18:25.537
Not a good idea to violate parole
the very first week.

18:30.345 --> 18:32.645

from The Hague.

58:49.008 --> 58:52.200
They wanted me to make
an evaluation...

58:52.300 --> 58:54.680
of you... your work

58:58.081 --> 59:00.928
I didn't know your position was shaky.

59:00.929 --> 59:03.762
Why didn't you tell me?

59:06.526 --> 59:09.028
<i>The Rise and Fall of
a hacker collective...</i>

59:09.029 --> 59:12.281
<i>celebrated as pop stars and
Robin Hoods of the hacker scene...</i>

59:12.282 --> 59:15.076
<i>and now linked to the
Russian mafia Cyber mafia...</i>

59:15.077 --> 59:16.674
<i>and the murder of a hacker.</i>

59:16.828 --> 59:20.632
<i>We ask ourselves:
Who is CLAY, really?</i>

59:22.576 --> 59:24.127
Where are you going, please?

59:24.128 --> 59:27.001
The printers were fun.
This isn't fun anymore!

59:27.002 --> 59:28.893
Krypton is dead, Max, dead!

59:28.894 --> 59:31.558
And we triggered a fucking
Secret Service scandal, man!

59:31.559 --> 59:33.032
Benjamin could go to the police

59:33.033 --> 59:35.711
and tell them he set up this
shitty CLAY by himself!

59:35.712 --> 59:37.676
You wanna sacrifice one of us?

59:37.677 --> 59:39.632
You wanted to get rid of him!

59:39.633 --> 59:43.048
I don't care what you do, I'm out!
- Stephan, wait.

59:43.049 --> 59:45.166
This is all my fault!

59:45.167 --> 59:47.534
I must find MRX!

59:48.007 --> 59:49.465
And then, what?

59:49.466 --> 59:52.699
It's not about us, they're after MRX
and FR13NDS. They're the target!

59:52.700 --> 59:53.950
Benjamin is right.

59:53.951 --> 59:56.903
Running gets us nowhere.
Hundreds officers are tracking us

59:56.904 --> 59:59.627
it's just a matter of time
until they get us!

59:59.628 --> 01:00:02.753
If we deliver MRX and FR13NDS
we'll be invisible again.

01:00:02.754 --> 01:00:04.066
Exactly.

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:07.100
I mean WE, not YOU !

01:00:23.061 --> 01:00:25.784

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:35.381
I'm fine. What do you want?

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:37.575
Um, last night...

01:00:37.576 --> 01:00:42.163
Um, last night you suddenly
disappeared and I thought...

01:00:42.164 --> 01:00:44.467
- I thought we...
- Do you want Max?

01:00:44.468 --> 01:00:46.768
Max? No!

01:00:47.449 --> 01:00:49.836
Listen, it's better you go now.

01:00:49.837 --> 01:00:53.123
Are you building a bomb
in there, or what?

01:00:53.124 --> 01:00:55.524
Is there anything you want?

01:00:56.295 --> 01:01:00.011
What's wrong with you?
You're all weird.

01:01:00.012 --> 01:01:05.022
Exactly! That's all you see?
A comical freak.

01:01:05.023 --> 01:01:09.562
You know what?
I wish I'd never met you!

01:01:13.969 --> 01:01:16.313
<i>We had to find MRX.</i>

01:01:16.314 --> 01:01:18.614

<i>Meanwhile were so paranoid that
we only used public networks.</i>

Don't fuck up, understand?

01:01:40.298 --> 01:01:42.546
Oh, here you are!

01:01:42.547 --> 01:01:44.847
Come quickly, we have something!

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.478
<i>I ran across it, quite by chance.</i>

01:01:47.479 --> 01:01:50.112
WHOAMI tried to contact MRX.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.281
His IP address is spoofed,

01:02:01.282 --> 01:02:02.981
going through several intermediaries,

01:02:02.982 --> 01:02:04.861
using hundreds of different
servers in Europe,

01:02:04.862 --> 01:02:07.898
changing his location
every 3 seconds.

01:02:07.899 --> 01:02:10.159
But, I think I got something.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.902
The server WHOAMI uses, always
responds to this IP address.

01:02:14.903 --> 01:02:16.431
Looks like a hub in Berlin.

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:20.265
OK, let me know when you
pinpoint the location.

01:02:20.545 --> 01:02:24.085

You are part of FR13NDS.
We want to be part of the FR13NDS.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.965
You did a good job with the BND.

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:06.665
Let's see if you can do it again.

I'm sorry.

What did MRX want?

01:06:18.414 --> 01:06:22.814
That we plant a Trojan
in the Europol system.

01:06:23.623 --> 01:06:27.847
Whoever has access to Europol,
can monitor the investigation

01:06:27.848 --> 01:06:29.772
and manipulate it.

01:06:29.773 --> 01:06:31.811
And what was your plan?

01:06:31.812 --> 01:06:34.075
We wanted to know who is MRX.

His identity for our freedom.

01:06:37.168 --> 01:06:39.598
We wanted to prove that
he's behind Krypton's death.

01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:42.878
We wanted to disappear from
the most wanted list.

01:06:42.879 --> 01:06:46.200
We wanted to be invisible again.

<i>It was a Trojan

<i>The moment MRX used our backdoor
to log onto the Europol server</i>

01:07:00.628 --> 01:07:02.996
<i>we'd be able to access his computer.</i>

01:07:02.997 --> 01:07:05.297

01:18:34.052 --> 01:18:35.767
Why not?

01:18:35.768 --> 01:18:37.384
Yeah...

01:18:37.385 --> 01:18:39.685
Why not.

01:18:49.278 --> 01:18:52.440
What else do you know about me?

01:18:52.441 --> 01:18:55.807
Do you know I've been suspended?

01:18:57.508 --> 01:19:00.262
You want to be invisible again.

01:19:00.263 --> 01:19:03.318
But FR13NDS knows who you are.

01:19:03.319 --> 01:19:05.475
You want a new identity.

01:19:05.476 --> 01:19:10.642
The witness protection program.
That's what this is about!

01:19:11.516 --> 01:19:15.416
I'll give you MRX for it...
and FR13NDS

01:19:15.427 --> 01:19:17.884
- It's not so easy.
- Oh yes.

01:19:17.885 --> 01:19:20.161
Your Special Task Force
would be a success,

01:19:20.162 --> 01:19:22.373
politicians and media, happy,

01:19:22.374 --> 01:19:25.190
and you'll be rehabilitated.

01:19:44.096 --> 01:19:45.909
Ok...

01:19:46.019 --> 01:19:48.519
Let's say I can arrange that.

01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:52.830
How will you get MRX?

01:19:55.558 --> 01:19:58.124
With a magic trick.

01:19:58.367 --> 01:20:00.886
There are holes in his story
as big as the Death Star!

01:20:00.887 --> 01:20:02.190
He's nothing,

01:20:02.191 --> 01:20:03.878
a nobody!

01:20:03.879 --> 01:20:06.824
He played with fire and got burned,

01:20:06.825 --> 01:20:08.829
but he can lead us to MRX!

01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:11.172
If we get him, we'll also have FR13NDS!

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:13.473
Hanne, you've been suspended.

01:20:15.088 --> 01:20:20.054
The witness protection program
is a local state responsibility.

01:20:20.077 --> 01:20:22.710
That's why I need you!

01:20:26.143 --> 01:20:29.249
How will this magic trick work?

01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:32.817
We'll attack MRX's weakest point...

01:20:33.291 --> 01:20:35.591
his pride!

01:20:42.291 --> 01:20:43.290
There he is.

01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:45.290
MRX is a traitor.

01:20:45.291 --> 01:20:46.290
He sold identities.

01:20:46.291 --> 01:20:47.390
He's working for the government.

01:20:47.391 --> 01:20:51.191
Got paid by the cops
to sell us out in another forum.

01:20:52.091 --> 01:20:54.691
MRX killed Krypton

01:20:54.691 --> 01:20:57.191
Really?
I can't believe it!

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:01.390
- Asshole!
- I knew it!

01:21:01.391 --> 01:21:02.390
He's part of FR13NDS!

01:21:02.391 --> 01:21:05.591
- MRX is Russian cyber-mafia!
- What a prick!

01:21:09.391 --> 01:21:13.091
I sold identities.
I spied on hackers.

01:21:13.691 --> 01:21:15.191
What the fuck?

01:21:15.391 --> 01:21:19.390
I co-worked with Law Enforcement
-Open the fucking door!

01:21:19.391 --> 01:21:20.490
What the fuck!

01:21:20.491 --> 01:21:24.490
That's not even MRX!
I'm MRX! Let me in!

01:21:24.491 --> 01:21:26.791
You thought I was one of you?

01:21:27.691 --> 01:21:28.991
Fuck you!

01:21:33.791 --> 01:21:36.490
Who are you? Who the fuck are you?

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:40.791
That's not MRX, I'm MRX!
I never worked in the government!

01:21:41.491 --> 01:21:43.791
Who the fuck are you?

01:21:43.891 --> 01:21:45.491
What the...?

01:21:46.491 --> 01:21:48.791
Who the fuck are you?

01:21:51.791 --> 01:21:53.791
Now I know who you are.

01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:56.491
You shouldn't have used the hammer.

01:21:56.791 --> 01:21:58.791
An IP transmitter.

01:21:58.991 --> 01:22:00.991
You've taught me.

01:22:12.161 --> 01:22:14.304
<i>Go, go, go! </i>

01:22:22.461 --> 01:22:24.604
Now we're even.

01:22:45.704 --> 01:22:48.004
We have him!

01:22:49.108 --> 01:22:51.499
What's his real name?

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.884
Sean Dunham. 19 years old,

01:22:53.885 --> 01:22:55.567
from New York.

01:22:55.568 --> 01:22:57.964
"You should be the last one.

01:22:57.965 --> 01:23:00.070
"You are not alone."

01:23:00.071 --> 01:23:02.771
That's from Superman!

01:23:03.868 --> 01:23:07.140
In a few hours you'll be a free man!

01:23:07.141 --> 01:23:10.141
New name, new city.

01:23:29.002 --> 01:23:33.402
<i>There are holes in his story
as big as the Death Star!</i>

01:24:41.143 --> 01:24:43.519
Frau Sturm?

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:46.347
- Yes?
- Hanne Lindberg, Europol.

01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:49.181
I'd like to ask you some questions.

01:24:49.234 --> 01:24:51.252
Ok.

01:24:53.513 --> 01:24:55.950
Do you know this person?

01:24:55.951 --> 01:24:58.251
No.

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.286
Benjamin Engel?

01:25:00.287 --> 01:25:02.872
He said you were in the same class?

01:25:02.873 --> 01:25:05.625
Benjamin Engel. Right, the freak.

01:25:05.626 --> 01:25:07.355
He always sat behind us.

01:25:07.356 --> 01:25:09.229
Have you seen Benjamin since then?

01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:11.530
No.

01:25:12.635 --> 01:25:15.271
Sorry, what's this all about?

01:25:15.272 --> 01:25:17.829
Benjamin is in the custody of the BKA.

01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:21.227
He said that in the last
few months you met often.

01:25:21.228 --> 01:25:23.828
Sorry, we what...?!

01:25:24.414 --> 01:25:27.181
He's not all there.

01:25:27.729 --> 01:25:31.895
Sorry, but, I'd never willingly
meet a guy like that!

01:25:37.093 --> 01:25:39.409
Thanks for taking the time to see me.

01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:41.160
It's about Hilde Engel.

01:25:41.161 --> 01:25:43.788
- Or rather, her grandson.
- Benjamin.

01:25:43.789 --> 01:25:46.168
- You know him?
- Since he was a little boy.

01:25:46.169 --> 01:25:47.699
I treated his mother.

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:49.539
What can you tell me about him?

01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:51.303
He's closed off.

01:25:51.304 --> 01:25:53.211
An outsider.

01:25:53.212 --> 01:25:55.041
No wonder, given his history.

01:25:55.042 --> 01:25:57.236
His mother took her own life.

01:25:57.237 --> 01:26:00.813
Benjamin grew up in a tangle
of conflicts.

01:26:00.814 --> 01:26:03.639
His mother suffered from
dissociative identity disorder.

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.067
Schizophrenia?

01:26:05.068 --> 01:26:07.464
Multiple personality disorder

01:26:07.465 --> 01:26:11.900
She had 4 personalities.
All aspects of herself.

01:26:11.901 --> 01:26:14.359
Medication kept things
temporarily at bay.

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.304
Finally she couldn't take it anymore.

01:26:17.305 --> 01:26:18.501
Is it hereditary?

01:26:18.502 --> 01:26:19.843
Possibly.

01:26:19.844 --> 01:26:21.709
What triggers it?

01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:24.702
There may be a predisposition,
or tendency,

01:26:24.703 --> 01:26:26.900
triggered by a traumatic event.

01:26:26.901 --> 01:26:29.919
Certain medications can
aggravate symptoms.

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.362
There are several triggers.

01:26:31.363 --> 01:26:33.663
Ritalin?

01:26:34.117 --> 01:26:36.950
Ritalin is one of them.

01:26:38.019 --> 01:26:40.772
But what exactly is this about?

01:26:40.773 --> 01:26:44.473
Is Benjamin alright?

01:27:05.146 --> 01:27:06.989
The lab results are in!

01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:09.990
Let me guess.
The cartridges are from WW II.

01:27:10.094 --> 01:27:11.394
Yes...

01:27:16.071 --> 01:27:18.026
Where did you get this wound?

01:27:18.027 --> 01:27:19.729
Max's hand was injured.

01:27:19.730 --> 01:27:21.922
Why did you have the car keys?

01:27:21.923 --> 01:27:25.046
Stephan drove to NBD.

01:27:25.047 --> 01:27:27.441
And what did you tell me about Paul?
About his mother?

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:29.173
She died when he was little.

01:27:29.174 --> 01:27:31.474
That was you!

01:27:32.529 --> 01:27:34.296
All of them are you!

01:27:34.297 --> 01:27:37.525
No. They're dead!

01:27:37.526 --> 01:27:40.442
There are no bodies! No trace!

01:27:40.443 --> 01:27:43.943
In any damn hotel in The Hague!

01:27:47.737 --> 01:27:51.037
What did you really see in the hotel room?

01:28:05.862 --> 01:28:08.162
<i>They don't exist.</i>

01:28:09.588 --> 01:28:13.355
<i>You created them in your imagination.</i>

01:28:14.769 --> 01:28:17.669
<i>CLAY, is you alone.</i>

01:28:20.259 --> 01:28:22.559
You are Max!

01:28:23.477 --> 01:28:26.032
What? Did you think I live here?

01:28:26.033 --> 01:28:27.451
You are Stephan!

01:28:27.452 --> 01:28:30.081
Ole Thurgen. Danish People's Front.

01:28:30.082 --> 01:28:32.382
You are Paul!

01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:37.787
Every action, it was you!

01:28:37.788 --> 01:28:39.186
Alone!

01:28:39.187 --> 01:28:40.961
I don't even know half the people.

01:28:40.962 --> 01:28:42.177
All fucking freeloaders!

01:28:42.178 --> 01:28:43.592
We need a name!

01:28:43.593 --> 01:28:45.558
We must become a brand!
<i>We must become famous!</i>

01:28:45.559 --> 01:28:47.940
<i>Attention is counterproductive.</i>

01:28:47.941 --> 01:28:49.387
<i>We're staying under the radar.</i>

01:28:49.388 --> 01:28:52.474
<i>Fuck the radar! A brand is awesome!</i>

01:28:52.475 --> 01:28:55.642
<i>Like Anonymous or LulzSec!</i>

01:28:56.279 --> 01:28:57.499
Like MRX!

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.800
<i>Ah, fucking nail!</i>

01:29:01.945 --> 01:29:03.747
Bingo.

01:29:10.222 --> 01:29:12.855
I'm not like my mother!

01:29:22.599 --> 01:29:24.899
I know who I am

01:29:25.677 --> 01:29:27.979
I know, who...

01:29:28.301 --> 01:29:31.534
That means that our agreement...

01:29:32.033 --> 01:29:36.407
This disqualifies you for the
witness protection program.

01:29:36.408 --> 01:29:38.553
No! You said we have a deal

01:29:38.554 --> 01:29:39.745
We have a deal.

01:29:39.746 --> 01:29:41.976
I get the witness protection program,
that's what you said!

01:29:41.977 --> 01:29:43.527
I'm sorry!

01:29:43.528 --> 01:29:45.534
They killed Krypton

01:29:45.535 --> 01:29:47.804
I betrayed MRX. They'll find me!

01:29:47.805 --> 01:29:49.256
Do you understand?

01:29:49.257 --> 01:29:51.372
We had a deal!
I get witness protection!

01:29:51.373 --> 01:29:53.673
That's what you promised!

01:29:53.681 --> 01:29:55.432
I'm sorry.

01:29:55.433 --> 01:29:57.008
You're sick!

01:29:57.009 --> 01:29:59.643
I'm not like my mother!

01:29:59.836 --> 01:30:03.731
I'm not like my mother.

01:30:08.678 --> 01:30:11.151
I'm not like my mother.

01:30:13.877 --> 01:30:16.177
I'm sorry!

01:30:20.527 --> 01:30:25.161
FR13NDS will kill me
like they killed Krypton!

01:30:25.325 --> 01:30:28.199
I want the witness protection program!

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:30.567
You promised me!

01:30:43.463 --> 01:30:45.763
Congratulations!

01:30:50.939 --> 01:30:54.185
The collaboration between Europol and BKA
(Fed. Criminal Police)

01:30:54.186 --> 01:30:57.657
was from the start highly
professional, efficient and productive.

01:30:57.658 --> 01:31:00.654
Mainly responsible for this
is Hanne Lindberg

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:04.226
who dealt an exceptional blow
to the cyber mafia

01:31:04.227 --> 01:31:07.089
The Internet is not a legal vacuum.

01:31:07.090 --> 01:31:09.674
The actors are not invisible.

01:31:09.675 --> 01:31:12.375
Everybody leaves traces.

01:31:13.185 --> 01:31:17.085
I asked if I could bring you
before the court.

01:31:28.758 --> 01:31:31.277
What did mama say then?

01:31:44.534 --> 01:31:47.568
I'm sorry I hacked you!

01:31:48.448 --> 01:31:50.748
It was wrong of me.

01:32:11.862 --> 01:32:16.695
The witness protection program
is literally a 'program'.

01:32:19.139 --> 01:32:21.639
You have 5 minutes

01:32:31.029 --> 01:32:32.996
<i>What will you tell them?</i>

01:32:32.997 --> 01:32:35.621
<i>That you ran off
on the way to the courthouse</i>

01:32:35.622 --> 01:32:37.622
<i>Won't you be fired again?</i>

01:32:38.231 --> 01:32:43.131
<i>They wanted MRX and FR13NDS.
You're nobody to them!</i>

01:32:43.406 --> 01:32:46.373
<i>You're invisible to them!</i>

01:32:47.292 --> 01:32:51.149
Promise me you're
through with hacking.

01:32:51.150 --> 01:32:53.450
I promise.

01:32:55.650 --> 01:32:58.484
No more magic tricks.

01:33:03.827 --> 01:33:06.028
Wait!

01:33:06.029 --> 01:33:08.596
One more thing

01:33:13.819 --> 01:33:16.919
How do you do this trick?

01:33:22.528 --> 01:33:26.895
If you know how it works,
it's almost disappointing.

01:33:34.278 --> 01:33:37.778
Everyone sees what they want to see.

01:33:40.710 --> 01:33:43.010
Take care!

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.326
[Birth certificate]

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:26.026
She swallowed it.

01:35:26.027 --> 01:35:29.671
The greatest social engineering
trick of all time.

01:35:29.672 --> 01:35:32.058
Not even Europol knows
who you are, now.

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:33.246
What name did you pick?

01:35:33.247 --> 01:35:35.547
No name

01:35:41.081 --> 01:35:43.381
<i>OK. Who am I?</i>

01:35:43.443 --> 01:35:44.942
<i>I'm Benjamin.</i>

01:35:44.943 --> 01:35:46.409
<i>I'm a hacker.</i>

01:35:46.410 --> 01:35:49.110
<i>and this is my story.</i>

01:35:52.515 --> 01:35:54.318
<i>Hacking is like magic</i>

01:35:54.319 --> 01:35:58.285
<i>They're both about deceiving others.</i>

01:36:01.714 --> 01:36:02.815
Where were you?

01:36:02.816 --> 01:36:04.203
They have my computer!

01:36:04.204 --> 01:36:05.853
They know who I am,
we gotta split, all of us!

01:36:05.854 --> 01:36:06.883
What happened?

01:36:06.884 --> 01:36:07.999
I was at Europol.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.941
How did you get in there?

01:36:09.942 --> 01:36:13.475
I pretended to be from a school group.
It doesn't fuckin' matter!

01:36:13.476 --> 01:36:15.558
The transfer was a trap!
They have all my data!

01:36:15.559 --> 01:36:17.180
Everything! You understand?

01:36:17.181 --> 01:36:20.948
We gotta split. Immediately!

01:36:23.879 --> 01:36:26.478
Come on, what are you waiting for?

01:36:26.479 --> 01:36:28.912
You're one of us!

01:36:29.041 --> 01:36:32.041
We won't leave you in the lurch!

01:36:34.598 --> 01:36:36.898
So, what now?

01:36:45.713 --> 01:36:48.613
No system is unhackable.

01:36:48.988 --> 01:36:50.597
Here, as I said:

01:36:50.598 --> 01:36:55.688
Excluded from the witness protection
program are people with mental illness.

01:36:56.494 --> 01:36:58.794
Once more from the beginning:

01:36:58.938 --> 01:37:01.564
Give her the information, piecemeal.

01:37:01.565 --> 01:37:04.557
It works only if you let
the thing come out by itself.

01:37:04.558 --> 01:37:08.258
And she mustn't feel manipulated.

01:37:10.557 --> 01:37:12.857
You can do it!

01:37:14.045 --> 01:37:16.478
That's all that's missing

01:37:26.889 --> 01:37:29.189
Ready?

01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:34.007
Fuck!

01:37:35.324 --> 01:37:37.957
We're all invisible!

01:37:38.452 --> 01:37:41.086
What if she checked?

01:37:41.950 --> 01:37:44.201
Don't worry,

01:37:44.202 --> 01:37:46.040
she has checked.

01:37:46.041 --> 01:37:49.074
But she has what she wanted.

01:37:50.808 --> 01:37:53.508
No more magic tricks.

01:37:55.808 --> 01:37:59.508
