WEBVTT

00:03.394 --> 00:04.656
So, Marjorie...

00:04.743 --> 00:05.788
Mm?

00:05.875 --> 00:08.051
How's it going
with the...

00:08.138 --> 00:09.618
[quietly]:
...chemo?

00:09.705 --> 00:11.185
Why are you
whispering?

00:11.272 --> 00:13.013
Are you afraid the
cancer will hear you?

00:13.100 --> 00:14.188
Fine.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.581
How's it going
with the chemo?

00:16.668 --> 00:18.627
Oh...

00:18.714 --> 00:20.716
It's great fun.

00:20.803 --> 00:23.762
I can't believe
I waited this long to try it.

00:23.849 --> 00:26.330
Actually, my doctor says

00:26.417 --> 00:28.071
I'm responding well
to treatment.

00:28.158 --> 00:29.072
Oh!

00:29.159 --> 00:30.247
That's good news.

00:30.334 --> 00:31.727
We should celebrate.
Yeah.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.859
Let's start by
getting you a new wig.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.600
Mom.
Oh, please.

00:35.687 --> 00:38.255
It's like a fat, gray
squirrel died on her head.

00:38.342 --> 00:41.519
This is my real hair, Bonnie.

00:44.783 --> 00:47.090
Oh.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.918
I need to go pee-pee.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.357
So you're...

00:53.444 --> 00:54.793
feeling good, then?

00:54.880 --> 00:56.534
Can we talk about
something else?

00:56.621 --> 00:58.797
Okay.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.148
Here's a biggie.Mm-hmm.

01:01.235 --> 01:02.932
You know how
Bonnie always said

01:03.019 --> 01:04.063
that she didn't know
who my real father was?

01:04.150 --> 01:05.848
Mm-hmm.

01:05.935 --> 01:08.024
Well... turns out she did.

01:08.111 --> 01:10.244
And I got to meet him.

01:10.331 --> 01:13.247
What?!

01:13.334 --> 01:15.205
We had to sit here

01:15.292 --> 01:17.251
and listen to
your mother ramble on

01:17.338 --> 01:19.731
for 20 minutes
about anal bleaching,

01:19.818 --> 01:20.993
and you have this?

01:23.474 --> 01:24.867
Tell me everything.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.782
There's not much to tell.

01:26.869 --> 01:27.957
I didn't actually tell him
I was his daughter.

01:28.044 --> 01:29.915
Why not?

01:30.002 --> 01:31.656
I don't know.

01:31.743 --> 01:32.179
I guess I chickened out.

01:34.006 --> 01:35.573
So is that it?

01:35.660 --> 01:36.661
[sighs]

01:36.748 --> 01:38.402
I'm not sure.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.926
I mean, I'd like to talk to him
about everything,

01:41.013 --> 01:44.713
but I'm afraid, you know?

01:44.800 --> 01:47.803
I mean, this guy totally
screwed my mom over.

01:47.890 --> 01:49.239
What if I like him?

01:49.326 --> 01:50.632
How is that not
going to hurt her?

01:50.719 --> 01:52.373
Oh, honey,

01:52.460 --> 01:54.244
it's great that you're concerned
about your mother,

01:54.331 --> 01:57.160
but you can't make this decision
based on how she might feel.

01:57.247 --> 01:58.030
You think?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.815
Oh, please.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.295
Your mom can take care
of herself; she's an adult.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.123
Score!
The tampon machine was broken.

02:04.254 --> 02:06.213
Smoke 'em if
you got 'em.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.279
ALVIN:
I swear to God,

02:29.366 --> 02:31.412
if those tools don't
magically reappear

02:31.499 --> 02:33.327
by the end of the day,

02:33.414 --> 02:35.198
I'm gonna gut you
like a fish!

02:35.285 --> 02:37.069
Now get out of here,
you friggin' thief!

02:41.900 --> 02:43.859
May I help you?

02:44.903 --> 02:46.296
No, that's okay.

02:46.383 --> 02:48.385
I'll come back when
you're not pissed off.

02:48.472 --> 02:49.386
Oh, you don't want
to wait that long.

02:49.473 --> 02:52.041
Come on in.

02:52.128 --> 02:53.956
Okay.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.044
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

02:55.131 --> 02:59.091
I don't know if you remember me.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.484
I was here a while back.

03:01.572 --> 03:03.139
'91 Volkswagen Jetta.

03:03.226 --> 03:04.314
Wow. Good memory.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.751
Yeah, for cars.

03:06.838 --> 03:09.058
And stolen tools!

03:10.364 --> 03:12.844
What can I do you for?

03:12.931 --> 03:16.108
Well, when last here,

03:16.196 --> 03:18.154
I failed to mention,

03:18.241 --> 03:20.287
um, certain facts...

03:20.374 --> 03:21.897
Oh! Fireballs.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.420
You like Fireballs?

03:23.507 --> 03:25.161
Yeah.So do I.

03:25.248 --> 03:26.249
It's weird, huh?

03:26.336 --> 03:27.555
Not really.

03:27.642 --> 03:31.080
Probably a few
million of us.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.473
I'm sorry, miss, it's just,
I'm a little busy...

03:32.560 --> 03:33.648
Bonnie Plunkett.

03:36.738 --> 03:37.391
Bonnie.

03:40.481 --> 03:43.005
Yeah.

03:43.092 --> 03:44.398
Um... I'm her daughter.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.880
Oh, my God.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.926
I'm your daughter.

03:51.013 --> 03:52.493
Yeah, yeah, I got that.

03:52.580 --> 03:56.148
You're the reason I'm short.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.238
I know how it works.

04:00.588 --> 04:04.418
I didn't know any other way
to do this.

04:04.505 --> 04:05.636
No, it's okay.

04:05.723 --> 04:07.290
Uh...

04:07.377 --> 04:09.205
it... so, uh...

04:09.292 --> 04:10.467
I'm sorry, what is your name?

04:10.554 --> 04:12.208
Christy.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.341
Christy.

04:14.428 --> 04:18.779
Uh... how did you find me?

04:18.867 --> 04:20.434
My mom actually found you.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.697
So she's alive?

04:23.785 --> 04:25.134
Yeah, of course.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.483
Well, if you knew her
when I knew her,

04:26.570 --> 04:28.877
that is nota given.

04:30.095 --> 04:32.576
Wow, okay.

04:32.663 --> 04:33.403
Look at you,
you're all grown up.

04:33.490 --> 04:36.363
Yep.

04:36.450 --> 04:37.581
MAN:
Hey, Alvin,

04:37.668 --> 04:39.670
I found those...
Get out!

04:42.499 --> 04:44.632
I'm sorry, I got a lot
of ex-cons working here.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.286
I can't close my eyes
for a second.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.856
So, Christy...

04:51.943 --> 04:53.336
what brings you here?

04:53.423 --> 04:55.382
Seriously?

04:55.469 --> 04:58.123
Yeah, stupid question.

04:58.210 --> 05:02.389
Listen, I don't want anything.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.435
I was just thinking
that maybe we could...

05:05.522 --> 05:07.481
get to know each other.

05:10.571 --> 05:13.704
Yeah, that-that's not
gonna happen.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.490
It's not?

05:16.577 --> 05:18.056
I can't do it, honey.

05:18.143 --> 05:20.885
No, I-I got a family--
a wife and kids.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.365
This thing here
with you, me and your mom--

05:22.452 --> 05:24.889
that's a non-starter.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.978
Oh.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.112
Wow.

05:30.199 --> 05:31.853
Yeah, I'm really sorry.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.945
It's all right.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.816
I should go.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.562
Just so you know,

05:45.649 --> 05:49.087
I turned out to be
a wonderful person!

05:56.138 --> 05:58.140
Got my temper.

06:03.537 --> 06:06.104
I mean...

06:06.191 --> 06:08.455
I dreamt about that moment
my entire life,

06:08.542 --> 06:11.980
and the man could barely
look me in the eye.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.680
I felt so stupid.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.553
So... worthless.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.557
I have one question.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.602
Yeah?

06:25.689 --> 06:27.604
What did I ever do
to make you hate me?

06:28.692 --> 06:31.216
What?

06:31.303 --> 06:32.479
You drive all the way to Chico
to see that little weasel

06:32.566 --> 06:36.004
and you don't tell me?

06:36.091 --> 06:39.137
Mom, please, can I
just have five minutes

06:39.224 --> 06:40.487
where we make it about me?

06:40.574 --> 06:41.488
All I'm saying is...

06:41.575 --> 06:42.489
Two minutes!

06:42.576 --> 06:43.925
Give me two!

06:44.012 --> 06:46.188
Look, I'm sorry,
but I'm a human being

06:46.275 --> 06:47.363
and I have feelings.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.451
Are you?

06:48.538 --> 06:50.975
Do you?

06:51.062 --> 06:54.283
Oh, my God, I have no parents.

06:54.370 --> 06:57.242
I'm officially an orphan.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.636
Little Orphan Christy.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.377
[sighs]

07:01.464 --> 07:02.509
Don't be so dramatic.

07:02.596 --> 07:03.988
You get that from him, you know.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.425
I get nothing from him!

07:05.512 --> 07:06.600
And yet you want him
in your life,

07:06.687 --> 07:08.253
disregarding how
it impacts on me.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.646
Excuse me, lady?

07:09.733 --> 07:11.126
Do you know where
my mother is?

07:11.213 --> 07:12.214
Because I really need
to talk to her

07:12.301 --> 07:13.824
about something important!

07:15.173 --> 07:16.479
Knockity-knock.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.481
To be continued.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.396
You guys have fun
at the park?

07:20.483 --> 07:21.615
You tell her.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.141
What happened?
Nothing.

07:26.228 --> 07:29.666
We were tossing the football,
I told him to go long and...

07:29.753 --> 07:31.799
neither one of us saw the tree.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.497
Oh, Baxter...

07:34.584 --> 07:37.021
I know, I'm stupid,
I'm-I'm a screwup...

07:37.108 --> 07:38.153
No.

07:38.240 --> 07:38.632
You're a great dad.

07:42.984 --> 07:43.941
I am?

07:44.028 --> 07:45.856
You're here, aren't you?

07:46.988 --> 07:48.076
Just go with it.

07:50.078 --> 07:52.297
Thank you.

07:52.384 --> 07:53.603
Oh!

07:53.690 --> 07:56.476
Here's his tooth.

08:04.701 --> 08:06.398
How's everything going here?

08:06.486 --> 08:07.399
Enjoying your dinner?

08:07.487 --> 08:08.400
It's wonderful.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.097
Is your food good, honey?

08:09.184 --> 08:10.359
Mm-hmm.

08:10.446 --> 08:11.795
Great.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.797
[quietly]:
Special occasion?

08:13.884 --> 08:15.582
Do we need a...
birthday cupcake?

08:15.669 --> 08:18.149
Oh, no, no. We're just having
a little daddy date.

08:18.236 --> 08:18.889
[chuckles]

08:18.976 --> 08:19.673
Really?

08:19.760 --> 08:20.804
Yeah.

08:20.891 --> 08:23.328
Yeah, we do it once a month.

08:23.415 --> 08:25.505
You know, give Mom a night off.
Catch up.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.769
[choked up]:
Well...

08:28.856 --> 08:31.249
isn't that terrific?

08:31.336 --> 08:33.251
Yeah, I love it.

08:33.337 --> 08:36.472
If I wasn't so busy,
I'd do it every week.

08:37.778 --> 08:40.432
Every week?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.738
What a...
[sniffles]

08:41.825 --> 08:43.131
...good dad you are.

08:43.217 --> 08:43.914
Thanks.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.829
And you...

08:45.916 --> 08:47.962
you are such a lucky girl.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.659
Okay.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.792
No! Not okay.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.620
Whoa.
It's a wonderful,
wonderful thing,

08:53.707 --> 08:55.273
and you need
to cherish your daddy!

08:55.360 --> 08:56.797
All right, let's not
ruin her birthday.

08:56.884 --> 08:59.495
It's not her birthday!
They do it every month!

09:02.411 --> 09:03.934
[knocking]

09:05.980 --> 09:07.547
Hi.
Is Christy Plunkett here?

09:07.634 --> 09:08.678
You a bill collector?

09:08.765 --> 09:10.462
No.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.463
Subpoena?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.509
No.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.772
Are we being
evicted again?

09:15.859 --> 09:16.773
No. What do you mean, "again"?

09:17.861 --> 09:19.776
Never mind.

09:19.863 --> 09:20.777
She's not here.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.736
Oh, okay.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.346
You, uh, you must be
her daughter.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.435
Listen, pal, we're not
joining your church.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.481
I'm not... Forget it.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.787
I'll come back another time.

09:30.874 --> 09:30.961
Whatever.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.923
Wow, my granddaughter's a joy.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.797
What do you want?

09:40.884 --> 09:42.843
Hi. Uh, I-I was hoping
we could talk.

09:42.930 --> 09:45.106
There's nothing to talk about.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.673
No, no, wait.
Christy, give me a chance!

09:46.760 --> 09:49.023
Please!

09:51.591 --> 09:52.504
[door opens]

09:52.592 --> 09:54.594
Hang on.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.732
I want you to buy me
an ice cream cone.

10:05.909 --> 10:08.042
Two scoops.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.915
And a bicycle

10:12.002 --> 10:15.702
and a Barbie Dream House.

10:15.789 --> 10:16.877
How about a pony?

10:16.964 --> 10:18.922
I'm not a child.

10:33.154 --> 10:35.025
Is it good?

10:35.112 --> 10:37.898
Mm-hmm.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.988
Yeah, pistachio is
my favorite flavor, too.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.859
Really?

10:42.946 --> 10:45.427
No, I was just trying
to make a connection.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.168
Listen, Christy,
I'm really sorry

10:47.255 --> 10:49.126
about how I acted
back at the garage.

10:49.213 --> 10:51.302
You just caught me
by surprise.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.435
Okay.

10:53.522 --> 10:56.046
And as far as what went down
with me and your mom

10:56.133 --> 10:57.657
when you were born...

10:57.744 --> 11:00.442
geez, I-I don't know
what to say.

11:04.881 --> 11:07.928
What kind of a man abandons his
newborn baby on Christmas Eve?

11:08.015 --> 11:12.846
Well, in my defense,
God did that to Jesus.

11:17.024 --> 11:18.939
Good-bye.

11:19.026 --> 11:21.332
No, no, I'm sorry, I'm...

11:21.419 --> 11:27.425
The answer to your question
is that I was a very stupid...

11:27.512 --> 11:31.342
very selfish, very frightened
young man,

11:31.429 --> 11:34.476
and I'm not that man anymore.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.134
Did you ever
think about me?

11:40.221 --> 11:41.091
Every day.

11:44.138 --> 11:46.140
And then after a few years,
I had to stop.

11:46.227 --> 11:49.056
I don't know--
it was too painful.

11:49.143 --> 11:51.754
And by painful,
I mean shameful.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.239
[sighs]

11:58.326 --> 12:00.023
So... now what?

12:00.110 --> 12:03.157
Well, like you said,

12:03.244 --> 12:06.987
I thought maybe we could
get to know each other.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.077
Yeah...

12:10.164 --> 12:12.122
that's not gonna
be so easy.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.602
Why not?

12:13.689 --> 12:17.649
You really did a
number on my mom.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.261
I don't see you and I having
any kind of relationship

12:20.348 --> 12:21.915
until you make things
right with her.

12:22.002 --> 12:24.395
Yeah, that makes sense.
How's she doing now?

12:24.482 --> 12:26.963
She's actually
doing great.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.618
Really got her
life together.

12:29.705 --> 12:32.534
Terrific. Where do I get
in touch with her?

12:32.621 --> 12:34.841
She's living on my couch.

12:38.192 --> 12:39.280
Yeah.

12:39.367 --> 12:42.022
The worst part about the chemo

12:42.109 --> 12:44.241
is it makes me so tired.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.635
You know, it just drains me
of all my energy.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.898
I can barely keep my eyes open.

12:48.985 --> 12:51.074
So chemo's kind of like
talking to you?

12:53.860 --> 12:57.167
Oh, I'm sorry if you find my
desperate fight for life boring.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.213
Apology accepted.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.563
So did Christy tell you
about meeting her father?

13:01.650 --> 13:03.173
Yeah. I thought it was great
they reconnected.

13:03.260 --> 13:06.655
Wow! Anything to hurt me.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.309
What are you talking about?

13:08.396 --> 13:10.398
Do I need to walk you
through it again?

13:10.485 --> 13:13.314
That rat-bastard dumped me and
Christy the minute she was born.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.316
No, I get it. You're angry.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.927
Angry?
I want to cut the son of a bitch

13:18.014 --> 13:21.017
from throat to scroat!

13:21.104 --> 13:23.890
Oh, Bonnie, you have
to let that go.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.240
Oh, Marjorie,
I most certainly do not.

13:26.327 --> 13:29.199
Well, it's your choice,
but holding on to anger

13:29.286 --> 13:30.200
is like drinking poison
and expecting it

13:30.287 --> 13:32.550
to kill the other person.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.378
Why do I even talk to you?

13:34.465 --> 13:36.119
You finally have a good
relationship with your daughter.

13:36.206 --> 13:39.949
If you stay angry at her father,
it could ruin that.

13:40.036 --> 13:42.909
[sighs]

13:42.996 --> 13:45.825
I hate you.

13:45.912 --> 13:46.564
And I love you.

13:46.651 --> 13:47.739
Stop that.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.176
Love you, love you, love you.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.004
Seriously, I will wring
whatever life

13:51.091 --> 13:52.919
you have left out of you!

13:54.224 --> 13:56.357
[car door closes]

13:56.444 --> 13:58.185
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things

13:58.272 --> 14:01.275
I cannot change
and the courage...

14:01.362 --> 14:03.581
not to set this evil dwarf
on fire. Amen.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.238
[knocking]

14:08.325 --> 14:09.631
Coming!

14:09.718 --> 14:11.285
[clears throat]

14:17.595 --> 14:21.338
Gee, I was starting to think
you'd never come back.

14:21.425 --> 14:22.383
Hi, Bonnie.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.733
You're losing your hair.

14:24.820 --> 14:28.519
It's not lost,
it's just in my ears.

14:28.606 --> 14:30.130
Thanks for agreeing to see me.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.566
My pleasure.
Please come in.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.611
Thanks.
Yeah.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.787
Can I, uh, get you
something to drink?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.398
No, thanks.

14:37.485 --> 14:40.183
I just had three beers
sitting in the car.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.098
Needed a little liquid
courage, did you?

14:42.185 --> 14:43.752
Yeah, it didn't really work.

14:43.839 --> 14:46.624
I just need to pee really bad.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.148
If you like, I could tie it
in a knot for you.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.370
It's okay, I'll hold it.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.243
Come, sit.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.158
Say what you have to say.

14:58.245 --> 15:00.508
All right.

15:00.595 --> 15:03.685
I guess I'll just
jump right in.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.121
I know what
happened was...

15:05.208 --> 15:07.123
You know, I'm sorry.
I can't listen to this.

15:07.210 --> 15:09.821
You left me with a one-day-old
baby and 18 bucks in my jeans.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.389
There is nothing you could say
that could ever make that right.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.914
I know. What I did was...You burned me so bad

15:15.001 --> 15:17.264
I could never let another man
near my heart!

15:17.351 --> 15:18.656
Believe me, when we broke up...

15:18.743 --> 15:20.441
There was no breaking up!

15:20.528 --> 15:22.356
Breaking up is fighting
and splitting up your albums

15:22.443 --> 15:25.837
and maybe one hot,
angry good-bye bang!

15:25.925 --> 15:28.840
What you did was
abandon me when I was

15:28.928 --> 15:31.147
the most vulnerable I've
ever been in my entire life!

15:31.234 --> 15:33.280
I'm-I'm not defending it...

15:33.367 --> 15:34.498
Yeah, because you can't!

15:34.585 --> 15:35.978
And just so we're clear,

15:36.065 --> 15:37.588
the only reason
you are sitting here

15:37.675 --> 15:39.155
is because my daughter
wants to get to know you,

15:39.242 --> 15:40.678
and I'm not gonna stand
in the way of that.

15:40.765 --> 15:41.679
I really appreciate...

15:41.766 --> 15:42.942
Shut up!

15:48.425 --> 15:51.298
But if you hurt
that little girl,

15:51.385 --> 15:53.430
I will hunt you down

15:53.517 --> 15:57.521
and I will kill you and
everything you love.

16:01.264 --> 16:02.439
I think I just peed a little.

16:07.401 --> 16:10.404
Well, I think I found
what the problem is.

16:10.491 --> 16:11.405
What is it?

16:11.492 --> 16:12.884
Your engine has like, uh,

16:12.972 --> 16:15.713
800,000 miles on it.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.237
Think it's time to trade it in?

16:17.324 --> 16:19.326
For what, a sandwich?

16:22.068 --> 16:23.678
I'll keep working on it.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.596
This is nice,
spending time with you.

16:28.683 --> 16:31.338
Yeah, it is.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.862
Is it okay if I call you Dad?

16:34.906 --> 16:36.996
I don't see why not.

16:38.649 --> 16:39.389
Okay.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.261
Dad.

16:41.348 --> 16:42.392
[chuckles]

16:42.479 --> 16:44.394
So...

16:44.481 --> 16:46.222
when do I get to
meet your family?

16:46.309 --> 16:47.223
Ow!

16:47.310 --> 16:48.572
Oh, my God.

16:48.659 --> 16:49.486
Are you all right?

16:52.489 --> 16:54.926
Yeah, I just
rang the bell a little.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.366
[exhales]

16:59.453 --> 17:01.324
Uh... well...

17:01.411 --> 17:03.718
I, uh...

17:03.805 --> 17:05.546
haven't yet
told them about you.

17:07.635 --> 17:08.592
What are you waiting for?

17:08.679 --> 17:10.594
Uh, tell you the truth,

17:10.681 --> 17:12.770
I was waiting till
I was on my death bed.

17:12.857 --> 17:13.336
What are they gonna do,
unplug me?

17:15.469 --> 17:18.428
So, what, I'm supposed to
introduce myself to them

17:18.515 --> 17:20.778
at your funeral?

17:20.865 --> 17:24.304
That works for me.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.348
I liked you a lot better when
you were in my imagination.

17:26.435 --> 17:28.395
Come on, Christy.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.092
My family thinks I'm a good guy.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.833
I-I just don't know
how to tell them

17:31.920 --> 17:33.095
that wasn't always the case.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.098
I understand.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.840
I already ruined your life once,
I wouldn't want to do it again.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.190
Now, come on, now.No, that's okay.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.758
Just... go home to your
happy little family

17:43.845 --> 17:45.151
and forget about me.

17:45.238 --> 17:46.543
You got to give me some time.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.415
I gave you 35 years!

17:48.502 --> 17:50.982
Ah.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.767
Violet, Roscoe.

17:52.854 --> 17:55.813
This spineless son of a bitch
is your grandfather!

17:58.294 --> 17:59.469
Call me Papa.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.044
[sighs]

18:09.131 --> 18:11.351
[somber music playing over TV]

18:11.438 --> 18:13.657
God, this is so sad.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.922
I can't believe they
killed that poor old dog.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.489
I know.

18:19.576 --> 18:23.058
You talk to Marjorie lately?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.890
It scares me, the
way your mind works.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.457
[horn honks outside]

18:30.544 --> 18:31.849
You expecting anybody?

18:31.936 --> 18:33.851
Nope.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.462
[sighs]

18:39.727 --> 18:41.511
What do you think?

18:42.599 --> 18:45.080
What do I think of what?

18:45.167 --> 18:46.603
Your new car.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.911
You're kidding me.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.913
No, no. I got it
at a police auction.

18:52.000 --> 18:52.914
Cleaned it up.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.002
Look at that door.

18:54.089 --> 18:56.135
Can't even see the bullet holes.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.180
[sighs]

18:58.267 --> 18:59.747
It's nice.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.966
But you can't buy me with a car.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.838
Okay.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.753
How about if I throw in a couple
of slightly used brothers?

19:10.453 --> 19:11.802
Hey, sis.'Sup?

19:14.718 --> 19:17.286
Hi.

19:17.373 --> 19:18.896
You told them?

19:18.983 --> 19:20.898
Yeah.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.291
No more secrets.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.075
I want you in my life.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.253
Where's your wife?

19:27.340 --> 19:30.473
She's still processing
the information.

19:30.560 --> 19:33.041
At her sister's in Albuquerque.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.912
She's totally pissed;
tried to stab him.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.219
All right.

19:39.308 --> 19:40.831
How about we take it for a ride

19:40.918 --> 19:42.224
and you get to know
your brothers better?

19:48.317 --> 19:51.146
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

19:51.233 --> 19:53.453
Ah.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.977
Hi, guys.
Hey.
Hi.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.414
Oh.
