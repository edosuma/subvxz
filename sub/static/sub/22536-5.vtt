WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.026
Previously on
crisis:
I arranged to be the chaperone
on the school trip

00:04.030 --> 00:05.497
And they're counting on me.
You get on the bus,

00:05.500 --> 00:07.058
You don't talk to me,
you don't look at me.

00:07.970 --> 00:09.494
Koz:
We know who you are.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.034
We talked to the agents
in that other suv.

00:11.040 --> 00:12.598
Movement!
(gunshot)

00:12.610 --> 00:14.134
Agent finley here

00:14.140 --> 00:16.631
Is the only person who has seen
the faces of the kidnappers.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.608
The only person who has heard
their actual voices.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.769
So, he's with you.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.111
With you as our only lead

00:22.120 --> 00:23.644
On the day when
a u.S. President's son

00:23.650 --> 00:25.117
Has been kidnapped.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.111
As you can tell
from the way you were taken,

00:27.120 --> 00:28.485
We are professionals.

00:28.490 --> 00:31.948
We are also very comfortable
with the use of force.

00:32.730 --> 00:34.391
(grunts, yells)

00:35.900 --> 00:37.128
Finley:
Tell me what you see.

00:37.130 --> 00:39.963
Dunn;
Two men, m/d-205,
bot/7 unconscious.

00:39.970 --> 00:41.130
Hold on that one.

00:42.670 --> 00:44.137
I know him.

00:44.140 --> 00:45.869
He was our liaison.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.905
We had a problem with
operation lennox.

00:47.910 --> 00:49.002
They're dead, francis.

00:49.010 --> 00:49.999
Who's dead?

00:50.010 --> 00:51.568
Men... Women...

00:51.580 --> 00:52.899
Children--
most of our guys.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.239
It just got out of hand.

00:54.250 --> 00:56.343
That massacre video you need...

00:56.350 --> 00:58.910
It's locked inside a cia vault.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.115
How you planning on
getting it out?

01:02.420 --> 01:04.820
Francis: You_have to
ask yourself rIght now:

01:04.830 --> 01:05.979
How far are you willing to go?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.651
What will you do for your child?

01:08.660 --> 01:10.696
Congressman wirth,
I need that phone!
Not yet.

01:10.700 --> 01:11.769
(gunshot)

01:13.070 --> 01:15.095
Do I get my kid back now?

01:20.840 --> 01:22.774
When can I see my mom?

01:22.780 --> 01:24.372
They're still
questioning her,

01:24.380 --> 01:27.178
But the important thing
is that she's okay.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.574
Agent finley here
saved her life.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.387
If my mom's in jail,

01:33.390 --> 01:35.017
Will they let her out
to go to my dad's funeral?

01:35.020 --> 01:36.817
I'm sure they will.

01:38.030 --> 01:39.850
We're almost done here,
shaﬂene.

01:39.860 --> 01:41.088
(over speaker):
You're doing great.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.351
Everything you're giving us

01:42.360 --> 01:44.567
Is going into the system
for processing.

01:44.570 --> 01:45.525
(computer clicks rapidly)

01:45.530 --> 01:46.861
I know this is hard...

01:46.870 --> 01:49.634
...But every detail
is going to help us identify

01:49.640 --> 01:52.529
And locate the kidnappers...

01:52.540 --> 01:54.235
And free your friends.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.879
We just wanted to
ask you about mr. Gibson.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.871
What about mr. Gibson?

01:58.880 --> 02:01.269
Did you ever see him interact
with any of the guards?

02:01.280 --> 02:02.816
Yeah.

02:02.820 --> 02:04.117
The first time was when

02:04.120 --> 02:06.884
He tried
to get us rescued and...

02:06.890 --> 02:08.380
They caught him
and punished him.

02:08.390 --> 02:09.550
Punished him how?

02:11.730 --> 02:13.288
They cut off his finger.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.057
Right in front of us.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.458
You said that was
the first time.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.324
What happened the second time?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.228
They took mr. Gibson away.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.129
They said to question him about
where he used to work.

02:24.140 --> 02:25.505
Beth ann said it was the cia.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.217
(phone ringing)

02:38.190 --> 02:40.317
(phone continues ringing)

02:50.430 --> 02:51.920
Francis (distorted):
Janice gibson?

02:51.930 --> 02:54.319
Listen careful if you want to
see your family again.

02:55.640 --> 02:56.959
(trembling):
Please...

02:56.970 --> 02:59.507
How did this...?

02:59.510 --> 03:01.000
You've been in my house.

03:01.010 --> 03:02.500
Francis (distorted):
You need to focus, janice.

03:02.510 --> 03:06.105
We know that cia director
widener is a close friend.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.508
He isn't my friend,

03:07.520 --> 03:09.044
He was just
my husband's old boss.

03:09.050 --> 03:10.517
That's a lie.
He's godfather

03:10.520 --> 03:12.283
(distorted):
To beth ann.

03:12.290 --> 03:13.348
He cares for you.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.282
Tell him you need him
and he will come.

03:15.290 --> 03:16.985
How do you know me?

03:16.990 --> 03:17.786
Francis (distorted):
We know everything...

03:17.790 --> 03:19.553
About all of you.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.959
Get widener to your house.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.496
(panﬁng)

03:22.500 --> 03:23.694
What will you do to him?

03:23.700 --> 03:25.622
Francis (distorted):
He trusts you, janice.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.837
To save your daughter's life,

03:28.840 --> 03:31.638
(distorted):
You will poison him.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.249
(low, indistinct conversations)

03:51.590 --> 03:52.579
Meg...

03:52.600 --> 03:54.659
What are you doing here?

03:54.660 --> 03:57.390
Sharlene is amber's best friend.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.322
She's going to be
staying with us

03:59.340 --> 04:00.568
Until your people
let her mother go.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.179
I know that you're alone

04:19.190 --> 04:21.454
And you won't
talk to me about it.

04:21.460 --> 04:23.951
But you should tell your partner
she's your daughter.

04:32.370 --> 04:33.120
Dunn?

04:36.440 --> 04:37.429
Your sister...

04:37.440 --> 04:39.465
You don't trust her, do you?

04:39.480 --> 04:42.699
No, I don't. That's why her fbi
handlers are staying close.

04:42.710 --> 04:44.803
Can I ask why
you don't trust her?

04:44.810 --> 04:46.209
No.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.471
She do something to you?

04:47.480 --> 04:50.313
"no," as in my personal life

04:50.320 --> 04:52.208
Has nothing to do with
this investigation.

04:52.220 --> 04:54.950
Your life includes_
your Sister and your niece.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.154
So maybe it does.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.787
It doesn't.

04:57.790 --> 04:59.052
Are we through with this?

04:59.060 --> 05:00.152
She must've done
a real job on you

05:00.160 --> 05:01.229
For you to
shut her down like that

05:01.230 --> 05:02.219
When her daughter's out there.

05:02.230 --> 05:03.959
We are done with this.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.221
Okay.

05:05.230 --> 05:06.822
We are done with this.

05:11.410 --> 05:13.833
Cia director is here.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.671
What do you make of that?

05:18.080 --> 05:19.308
I can tell you they were
special forces soldiers

05:19.320 --> 05:20.947
Who were operating for the cia

05:20.950 --> 05:22.941
When they went missing
or presumed dead.

05:22.950 --> 05:26.078
But I have no idea what they
were doing at the embassy,

05:26.090 --> 05:28.456
Nor what they had to do
with this kidnapping.

05:28.460 --> 05:30.519
That's why we'd like to
question them, find out.

05:30.530 --> 05:33.124
Cia can speak with
those soldiers

05:33.130 --> 05:35.792
As soon as they're conscious
and ready for questioning.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.654
I appreciate that.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.524
It's important for us
to work together on this.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.723
Of course.

05:46.210 --> 05:47.666
(computers beeping, trilling)

05:51.810 --> 05:54.870
You were both at the agency
when congressman wirth died.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.347
Yes, sir.

05:56.350 --> 05:58.386
That was a tragedy.

05:58.390 --> 05:59.914
Dunn:
Yes, srr, It was.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.850
(phone ringing)

06:03.890 --> 06:06.256
(phone continues ringing)

06:07.560 --> 06:08.788
Well, I'll let you
get back to work.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.358
You let me know
when they're awake.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.827
(phone continues ringing)

06:12.840 --> 06:15.638
Those soldiers regained
consciousness an hour ago.

06:15.640 --> 06:16.459
Sir?

06:16.470 --> 06:17.562
Those two soldiers,

06:17.570 --> 06:19.458
They regained consciousness
an hour ago,

06:19.480 --> 06:21.630
So you go out there
and you question them.

06:21.640 --> 06:22.572
And the cia?

06:24.050 --> 06:25.574
Widener just lied
right to my face.

06:26.580 --> 06:27.979
Get me some answers

06:27.980 --> 06:29.675
And then we'll deal
with the cia.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.543
Yes, sir.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.449
(doorbell rings)

06:41.500 --> 06:42.524
I'm

Fry

ic
e

06:42.530 --> 06:44.418
With all these
parents being used,

06:44.430 --> 06:46.398
They made me promise to
follow protocol.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.601
Would have been easier to
come to helmand provmce today.

06:53.610 --> 06:55.874
No, I understand.
I-I'm just really...

06:55.880 --> 06:57.177
Grateful you came.

06:59.510 --> 07:02.013
Listen, I'm sorry
I didn't call you first.

07:02.020 --> 07:03.772
You've been in my thoughts
since this happened.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.441
Can I get you some coffee?

07:06.460 --> 07:08.280
Or can you sit down?

07:08.290 --> 07:09.450
Or do you have to wait
till they tell you it's safe?

07:09.460 --> 07:10.688
I don't really know...

07:10.690 --> 07:11.679
How this works.

07:11.690 --> 07:13.021
Yeah, it's okay.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.156
Gentlemen, I think I'm fine.

07:19.770 --> 07:20.862
(sighs)

07:20.870 --> 07:22.565
Listen, I know it's just words,

07:22.570 --> 07:24.561
But you should we are doing
everything we possibly can

07:24.570 --> 07:25.537
To find beth arm and francis.

07:25.540 --> 07:26.529
I know.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.235
Thank you, gabe.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.128
I'm, I'm gonna pour some coffee.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.469
Or, are, uh,
would you prefer tea?

07:31.480 --> 07:33.471
I, I think I have tea.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.469
Coffee's fine.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.539
I'll come with you.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.557
Widener: I understand the fbi
had some questions

07:43.560 --> 07:45.050
About francis.

07:45.060 --> 07:47.153
Is there anything
you want to ask me about?

07:47.160 --> 07:48.889
Is there a connection?

07:48.900 --> 07:50.549
Did this happen because
francis was cia?

07:50.570 --> 07:51.889
No, no.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.993
You don't kidnap
the president's son

07:54.000 --> 07:55.365
Trying to get to
an ex-analyst.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.828
So, janice, why did you
ask me to your house

07:59.840 --> 08:01.569
And not just come to my office?

08:01.580 --> 08:04.003
Do you still
take it with cream?

08:04.010 --> 08:06.069
That's right.

08:07.110 --> 08:09.578
I always knew you
were a great mom.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.978
You would do anything
for your daughter.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.487
Wouldn't you?

08:20.760 --> 08:22.022
You're trembling.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.295
Janice, listen to me...
(sighs)

08:27.300 --> 08:28.767
It's gonna be okay.

08:28.770 --> 08:30.499
It's all going to be...

08:30.510 --> 08:32.068
Okay.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.404
But I'm not going to drink this.

08:37.780 --> 08:40.078
(coffee splashes in sink)

08:41.380 --> 08:43.473
Did you really expect her
to pull that off

08:43.490 --> 08:45.788
On the head of the cia?

08:45.790 --> 08:46.779
No, I really didn't.

08:46.790 --> 08:47.779
That poison

08:47.790 --> 08:49.815
Wasn ’1' even real.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.183
(crying):
They called me.

08:51.190 --> 08:52.953
The kidnappers,
they called me...

08:52.960 --> 08:54.518
And told me to bring you here.

08:54.530 --> 08:56.794
They...

08:56.800 --> 08:58.859
They told me
I had to poison you.

08:58.870 --> 08:59.894
Francis:
But] knew widener

08:59.900 --> 09:01.060
Would be suspicious

09:01.070 --> 09:02.537
From_ the moment
my Wife called him.

09:02.540 --> 09:04.360
I needed him
to catch her at something,

09:04.370 --> 09:05.837
So he'd lower his guard.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.728
Janice:
They told me to poison you.

09:11.550 --> 09:14.474
And now they're gonna
kill my family.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.368
Koz:
So why is he really there?

09:21.590 --> 09:24.616
Come here.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.524
Shh.
(sobs quietly)

09:31.530 --> 09:33.498
(janice cries)

09:45.010 --> 09:46.898
Clarenbach:
They're still In and out
of consciousness

09:46.920 --> 09:49.548
And not sure where they are
or why they're here.

09:49.550 --> 09:51.541
_ Dunn: We need to
Videotape his statement.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.609
Look, I know they're important
to your investigation,

09:53.620 --> 09:55.952
But I can give you a few minutes
with them, at most.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.552
What happened to them?

09:57.560 --> 09:59.357
Medically, I'm not sure.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.022
They were in a
chemically induced coma.

10:02.030 --> 10:03.349
They have older healed wounds,

10:03.370 --> 10:05.520
Typical of soldiers
you see in combat, but...

10:05.530 --> 10:06.895
Nothing out of
the ordinary.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.128
Hawkins is awake now.

10:08.140 --> 10:10.529
You get a few minutes
with him, that's all.

10:19.310 --> 10:20.902
Hey, soldier.
How are you doing?

10:20.920 --> 10:24.310
(weakly): Hawkins... Del.
Sergeant first class.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.483
United states army.
537009185.

10:27.490 --> 10:28.787
Dun_n: You're not
a prisoner of war.

10:28.790 --> 10:31.156
You're in america.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.388
We're with the fbi.

10:32.390 --> 10:35.097
You're safe here.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.556
Can you tell me what happened?

10:36.570 --> 10:39.562
Hawkins... Del.
Sergeant first class.

10:39.570 --> 10:43.062
United states army.
537009185.

10:44.140 --> 10:45.437
Can we talk about
that mission?

10:45.440 --> 10:47.931
Lots of missions, sir.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.703
The one with
those civilians.

10:51.810 --> 10:53.505
Not at liberty to say, sir.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.839
Because of what you did?

10:54.850 --> 10:56.613
Not at liberty to say, sir.

10:56.620 --> 10:58.542
I saw a video of you,
hawkins.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.083
A helmet-cam.
I saw what you did.

11:06.590 --> 11:07.579
(woman screaming)

11:07.600 --> 11:08.851
(gunshots, screaming continues)

11:08.860 --> 11:10.691
We killed women and...

11:10.700 --> 11:12.691
(gunfire)

11:12.700 --> 11:13.826
...Children.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.398
(gunfire)
boy: No!

11:17.040 --> 11:19.463
Hawkins:
We killed each other.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.869
What was that mission,
hawkins?

11:24.010 --> 11:25.272
It's not a mission.

11:27.180 --> 11:29.944
It's just training.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.144
Training for what?

11:31.150 --> 11:34.540
Please...

11:34.560 --> 11:36.380
Don't make me_
do the mISSlon, Sir.

11:36.390 --> 11:38.085
(hawkins panting)

11:40.660 --> 11:42.150
I'm gonna have to
ask you both to leave.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.299
We'll stay until we can
question them again.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.029
That won't happen.

11:46.030 --> 11:48.123
The cia has just served this
hospital with a court order

11:48.140 --> 11:49.232
To turn over these soldiers.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.730
When are they
coming for them?

11:50.740 --> 11:52.537
They're not coming for them.

11:52.540 --> 11:53.768
They're already here.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.368
Hawkins (on video):
We killed women and...

12:02.380 --> 12:03.369
...Children.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.210
(panﬁng)

12:05.220 --> 12:06.312
We killed each other.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.309
Sir...

12:07.320 --> 12:09.208
Our agents
on janice gibson

12:09.220 --> 12:11.381
Reported widener
entering her home.

12:11.390 --> 12:13.255
What's he doing in there?

12:13.260 --> 12:16.354
His cia escorts _
won't let our guys In.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.669
Cited national security.

12:19.870 --> 12:21.223
Get director widener
on the phone.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.764
Hawkins (quietly):
Please...

12:22.770 --> 12:24.692
Don't make me_
do the mISSlon, Sir.

12:28.510 --> 12:30.239
Masked gunman:
Housekeeper teach you that?

12:33.380 --> 12:34.449
Asked you a question.

12:36.780 --> 12:38.782
My mother...

12:38.790 --> 12:39.779
She taught me.

12:39.790 --> 12:42.054
And what would she say,

12:42.060 --> 12:45.450
If she knew about
you and the teacher?

12:57.940 --> 12:59.202
Amber?

13:00.240 --> 13:01.502
Hey, amber, look at me.

13:02.710 --> 13:04.007
Are you okay?

13:05.210 --> 13:07.041
No. No.

13:07.050 --> 13:08.449
I don't think I am.

13:08.450 --> 13:09.872
You're shaking, what's wrong?

13:11.290 --> 13:12.416
The guard.

13:12.420 --> 13:13.819
The tall one.

13:15.890 --> 13:17.778
They said if we
follow the rules,

13:17.790 --> 13:18.950
No one would get hurt.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.154
That isn't true.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.949
He doesn't follow the rules.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.428
We have to protect ourselves.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.897
How do we do that?

13:26.900 --> 13:28.458
I have an idea.

13:32.140 --> 13:33.903
(water running)

13:46.920 --> 13:48.444
Why are you
looking at me like that?

13:48.460 --> 13:49.984
Like what?

13:49.990 --> 13:51.457
Like you know me.

13:51.460 --> 13:54.258
I'm, I don't. I-I wasn't.

13:54.260 --> 13:56.797
The cia just cleared
the main gate.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.358
How many of them were there?

13:58.370 --> 13:59.462
Too many for us to stop.

13:59.470 --> 14:00.698
They have a court order.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.099
Why would you want to stop them?

14:02.100 --> 14:04.864
These soldiers connect
us to the kidnapper.

14:04.870 --> 14:08.465
If the cia takes them,
our connection is lost.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.879
I killed a man who
tried to take them.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.131
You killed a man too.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.345
We can't_lose
that connection now.

14:14.850 --> 14:16.442
The cia had these guys
in a hole.

14:16.450 --> 14:17.872
They take them back,
no one will ever see them again.

14:17.890 --> 14:18.948
You know that.

14:23.460 --> 14:25.485
You equipped for
biohazard containment here?

14:25.490 --> 14:27.219
Fully equipped. Why?

14:34.540 --> 14:36.189
I should go.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.191
I am so sorry... Gabe.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.700
Francis:
Update, please?

14:39.710 --> 14:40.859
Gunwoman:
I'm past two layers
of encryption.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.404
20 more minutes

14:42.410 --> 14:44.230
And I will have full access
to widener's handset.

14:47.380 --> 14:49.041
You're hacking
into his phone?

14:49.050 --> 14:50.540
They scanned your house
before they let widener in.

14:50.550 --> 14:55.249
My job was to teach
them their job.

14:55.260 --> 14:58.013
They could take that place
apart board by board,

14:58.030 --> 14:59.850
And they'd never find the
equipment I planted there.

14:59.860 --> 15:01.589
You want him to stay
in your home.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.522
Why would he stay after
she's tried to kill him?

15:03.530 --> 15:04.895
Because...

15:04.900 --> 15:07.596
I've always known
what widener wanted.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.489
And my wife knows what
he's always wanted too.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.907
Janice:
Now what?

15:12.910 --> 15:14.639
You're not alone, janice.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.673
I know you feel that way.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.147
But you're not.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.442
Remember when things
got bad with francis

15:26.450 --> 15:28.042
And you had to
leave the house?

15:28.060 --> 15:30.915
We made it through that,
didn't we?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.750
I thought about you then.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.459
What it would be like,

15:36.460 --> 15:39.065
Being together with you.

15:39.070 --> 15:41.197
You know you're
not alone.

15:44.540 --> 15:46.132
Gunwoman:
I need more time.

15:46.140 --> 15:48.005
If he leaves now,
we'll never get it.

15:54.420 --> 15:57.048
I'm into widener's handset

15:57.050 --> 15:59.712
And am searching for anything
having to do with the soldiers.

16:02.660 --> 16:04.116
You think I wanted this?

16:05.390 --> 16:07.722
I didn't want this.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.096
I didn't want the life
I built taken from me.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.297
I don't want to put my family
or these children in danger.

16:14.300 --> 16:17.098
I don't want to wage war
against the agency I love.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.635
All of these things
cause me pain.

16:19.640 --> 16:23.178
But the most effective way
to deal with pain,

16:23.180 --> 16:25.034
Is to embrace it.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.015
That way...

16:35.020 --> 16:36.817
It has no power over you.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.781
(alarm blaring)

16:40.800 --> 16:44.588
Pa announcer:_ _
Security breach. Initiate
immediate lockdown protocol.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.495
(alarm continues blaring)

16:51.310 --> 16:52.709
(door slams)

16:52.710 --> 16:54.530
This is kidnapping.

16:54.540 --> 16:57.475
Taking me and these
two patients-- it's kidnapping.

16:57.480 --> 16:58.469
Yeah. There's a lot
of that going around.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.572
Give me your phone.

17:02.380 --> 17:03.745
And we're saving
these guys.

17:06.050 --> 17:07.847
You are aware that the people
you're trying to keep out

17:07.860 --> 17:09.782
Will get in before
these guys wake up again?

17:09.790 --> 17:11.348
That's why you're
coming with us.

17:11.360 --> 17:13.351
Coming with you where?

17:13.360 --> 17:14.657
You might...

17:14.660 --> 17:16.525
Want to cover your eyes.

17:16.530 --> 17:18.919
(tires screech, glass breaks)

17:21.740 --> 17:23.037
(medical monitor beeping)

17:24.240 --> 17:27.403
(siren wailing)

17:35.650 --> 17:37.379
You want to do
this on your own?

17:39.550 --> 17:40.812
You want to find amber?

17:42.390 --> 17:44.654
Then tell me about
the guy you're looking for.

17:44.660 --> 17:46.423
The man who used
to work for you--

17:46.430 --> 17:47.920
You said something
horrible happened then--

17:47.930 --> 17:49.989
And that's why he
left. What was it?

17:53.270 --> 17:54.760
I didn't ask.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.595
Because you didn't
want to know.

18:00.010 --> 18:02.001
It was that
bad, was it?

18:02.010 --> 18:04.001
Man:
Mrs. Fitch, I've got a hit.

18:06.010 --> 18:08.478
(monitor beeping)

18:15.290 --> 18:16.917
Beth ann,
what's going on?

18:16.930 --> 18:18.010
Don't do that.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.122
Where's the blade, beth ann?

18:19.130 --> 18:20.381
Why?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.197
You want to protect me?

18:22.200 --> 18:23.394
If you want to do
something for me,

18:23.400 --> 18:24.628
Get your secret service
agent out here

18:24.630 --> 18:26.689
Out here and tell me
how my father is.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.588
Tell us all howjin liao is.

18:30.440 --> 18:31.691
You're wrong about hurst.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.302
He's a bad guy, kyle.

18:33.310 --> 18:35.471
I'd know if he were bad.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.074
Maybe you're just bad
at reading people.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.377
He's one of them, kyle.

18:39.380 --> 18:40.506
Accept it.

18:44.590 --> 18:45.887
Widener's exiting the house.

18:45.890 --> 18:48.211
He'll be out of range shortly.

18:48.220 --> 18:50.108
Raw data dump from
his phone is complete.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.950
Initiate |ev_el
four decryption.

18:53.330 --> 18:56.595
The cia is gonna take
those soldiers from the fbi.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.898
Then I'm gonna
take them from the cia.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.494
I'm done with him.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.967
The huntley...

19:02.970 --> 19:06.508
Model 4711 utility knife
comes with six blades.

19:06.510 --> 19:08.808
This one has four. The
fifth one's in the trash.

19:08.810 --> 19:10.232
The sixth one's
unaccounted for.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.969
Masked gunman:
Main room.

19:12.980 --> 19:14.743
Main room.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.570
Everyone, sit down!

19:35.140 --> 19:36.767
"one _of these blades
is missmg.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.600
"you have 10 seconds
to bring it here.

19:40.610 --> 19:43.135
"after that,
there will be a search.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.778
You do not want that
to happen."

19:44.780 --> 19:45.849
(muffled):
Ten...

19:45.850 --> 19:47.545
Nine...

19:47.550 --> 19:49.347
Eight...

19:49.350 --> 19:50.339
Seven...

19:51.290 --> 19:52.712
Six...

19:52.720 --> 19:54.017
Five...

19:54.020 --> 19:56.056
Four...

19:56.060 --> 19:57.652
Three...

19:57.660 --> 19:58.718
Two...

19:58.730 --> 20:01.187
One...

20:01.200 --> 20:02.997
Line up to be searched.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.127
Now!

20:05.130 --> 20:06.859
Line up now!

20:06.870 --> 20:07.996
Single file!

20:08.000 --> 20:09.592
Move!

20:13.310 --> 20:15.369
(siren wailing)

20:15.380 --> 20:16.472
Do we call olsen?

20:16.480 --> 20:17.879
No. We keep him
clean of this.

20:18.810 --> 20:20.072
Give me your phone.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.046
I pulled the ambulance's gps.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.915
This is a mistake.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.387
You need to take us back.

20:29.390 --> 20:30.687
Dunn: This is about
finding kidnapped kids

20:30.690 --> 20:32.487
And I need you to be
more of a team player.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.327
How are those soldiers doing?

20:35.330 --> 20:37.252
Stable... For now.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.420
When will they
come around again?

20:39.430 --> 20:40.499
I don't know.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.603
We need to get off this street.

20:45.610 --> 20:48.329
Yeah. I got an idea.

20:48.340 --> 20:50.706
(tires screeching)

20:50.710 --> 20:52.473
This room is clear.

20:55.680 --> 20:56.942
Can I ask you something?

20:56.950 --> 20:58.178
Yeah.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.714
Sure.
When they questioned you

20:59.720 --> 21:00.914
Back there...

21:00.920 --> 21:02.319
What did they want to know?

21:06.060 --> 21:07.789
I'm not allowed to say.

21:13.130 --> 21:15.189
Everyone out.

21:25.210 --> 21:27.872
No, no, no.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.370
Everyone out...

21:29.380 --> 21:31.416
But you.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.945
What are you doing?

21:36.720 --> 21:37.982
You need to leave this room.

21:37.990 --> 21:39.981
Here I go.
Hey... What...

21:39.990 --> 21:42.823
Amber:
Don't, you're choking him, stop!

21:42.830 --> 21:45.890
No! Stop,
you're hurting him.

21:45.900 --> 21:48.164
Please.

21:48.170 --> 21:49.660
Stop.

21:49.670 --> 21:51.831
Stop.
(groans)

21:51.840 --> 21:53.137
(gasping)

22:01.620 --> 22:03.576
What?

22:03.580 --> 22:07.084
That you let the
teacher touch you.

22:07.090 --> 22:10.218
I...

22:11.790 --> 22:14.452
I let him touch me.

22:14.460 --> 22:17.998
That this one here

22:18.000 --> 22:21.390
Is not good enough for
you to even look at.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.663
That you're not good enough.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.936
Search her.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.712
(quietly):
Okay...

22:51.800 --> 22:54.223
This room is clear.

22:59.010 --> 23:01.160
You do what you need to do
to get those soldiers

23:01.180 --> 23:03.136
Back from the fbi.

23:08.680 --> 23:11.274
Olsen:
You find them
before the cia does.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.584
I'm working on our alibi.

23:17.590 --> 23:19.478
Yeah, how does it go?

23:19.490 --> 23:22.755
The kidnapper staged attacks by
impersonating law enforcement.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.149
We saw the cia
agents and assumed

23:25.170 --> 23:26.694
It was an attack
on the soldiers.

23:26.700 --> 23:28.190
We did what we thought
was necessary.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.031
And we didn't report it because?

23:30.040 --> 23:31.234
I haven't gotten that far.

23:35.110 --> 23:37.578
You think we crossed the line?
Yeah, I do.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.002
So, when it comes time
to tell the brass

23:39.010 --> 23:41.843
What happened here today,
you back me up?

23:41.850 --> 23:43.738
We tell the same story.

23:43.750 --> 23:46.878
Will we tell the same story?

23:46.890 --> 23:50.519
Agent dunn,
let me ask you something.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.725
How come you don't
have a partner?

23:52.730 --> 23:54.288
I'm in between.

23:54.300 --> 23:55.551
You're in between a lot.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.424
You read my file.

23:56.430 --> 23:57.692
You read mine.

23:57.700 --> 24:00.191
Ask me anything you want

24:00.200 --> 24:02.430
After you tell me why it is
you can't keep a partner.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.567
Why does it matter? Are you
worried you can't trust me?

24:04.570 --> 24:06.060
I'm worried that we've been in
this knee-deep for four days

24:06.070 --> 24:08.265
And you ask me that question.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.276
We're here, aren't we?

24:11.280 --> 24:13.271
Hawkins:
Hey! Hey!

24:13.280 --> 24:15.771
Hey!

24:17.650 --> 24:19.538
(gasping):
You gotta help me...

24:19.550 --> 24:21.643
Help you do what, hawkins?

24:21.660 --> 24:23.150
Help me stay awake.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.219
Don't let me sleep.

24:25.230 --> 24:27.050
I dreamed of those people.

24:27.060 --> 24:28.982
The ones you killed in training?

24:29.000 --> 24:31.753
No, the ones they're
sending me to kill next.

24:31.770 --> 24:34.159
Where? Where are they
sending you, hawkins?

24:34.170 --> 24:37.139
Washington, dc.

24:37.140 --> 24:38.937
He's gonna make me do it again.

24:38.940 --> 24:41.067
Who is?

24:41.080 --> 24:42.160
He... He...

24:42.180 --> 24:45.274
He is.

24:45.280 --> 24:48.443
What is that?

24:48.450 --> 24:51.339
Doctor:
I'm so sorry.

25:00.260 --> 25:02.182
I do know you.

25:12.670 --> 25:14.262
Station orange,
this is the doctor.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.531
Request for pickup.

25:24.780 --> 25:26.179
Not gonna check
for keistering?

25:27.990 --> 25:30.857
You want to put a blade up
there, you can keep it.

25:32.730 --> 25:34.789
That's a lot of meds
for one kid.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.620
Messed-up dc rich kid.

25:36.630 --> 25:39.292
Better parenting
through chemistry, yo.

25:39.300 --> 25:41.268
Don't "yo" me.

25:42.970 --> 25:44.494
These-- where are the bottles?

25:44.510 --> 25:45.909
It's my travel bag.

25:45.910 --> 25:48.538
The mothership bucket's
back at the house.

25:50.710 --> 25:52.769
This room is clear.

25:54.410 --> 25:56.014
Unbelievable.

25:56.020 --> 25:58.011
You're stealing meds
from other kids, aren't you?

25:58.020 --> 25:59.339
Give me those pills, bro.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.045
Like things aren't bad enough?

26:01.060 --> 26:02.140
You are going
to put these back.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.650
The hell I am.

26:03.660 --> 26:05.184
I didn't drain any kid.

26:05.190 --> 26:06.589
I just took a few off the top.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.857
Don't be pissed at me, lqle.

26:10.870 --> 26:13.395
Now that sloan's gone,
you're all I got.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.996
Put these back
where they belong.

26:25.880 --> 26:29.372
Did something
happen back there?

26:29.380 --> 26:31.348
No, nothing like that.

26:31.350 --> 26:32.886
I was just thinking...

26:32.890 --> 26:35.688
Thinking about your mother.

26:35.690 --> 26:37.112
At least in here,

26:37.120 --> 26:39.588
We have each other,
and she's all by herself.

26:39.590 --> 26:41.126
Yeah.

26:41.130 --> 26:43.758
I'm sure we'll be together soon.

26:43.760 --> 26:47.560
Dad, we weren't
together before.

26:47.570 --> 26:49.128
Maybe we can
give it another try.

26:53.070 --> 26:56.039
(ragged breathing)

27:12.160 --> 27:15.721
Man (over p.A.):
This is station orange c0293gh.

27:15.730 --> 27:17.994
You're two minutes
to extraction.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.400
What are you gonna do
with these soldiers?

27:30.010 --> 27:32.308
Hey!
I'll put the next
one into you.

27:35.450 --> 27:36.974
What are you gonna do
with these soldiers?

27:38.120 --> 27:40.111
Ask your partner's sister.

27:40.120 --> 27:46.525
Man:
This is station orange c0293gh.

27:46.530 --> 27:47.849
We are go for extraction.

27:47.860 --> 27:49.919
We are go.

28:07.980 --> 28:09.140
You can't take them.

28:09.150 --> 28:11.277
We were never here.

28:13.290 --> 28:15.246
Go back to sleep.

28:28.740 --> 28:30.139
Listen, beth ann.

28:30.140 --> 28:32.233
Give me the razor blade.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.629
How do you know I have it?

28:40.810 --> 28:42.209
The first time
you showed my that,

28:42.220 --> 28:43.869
I thought you were
such a bad ass.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.509
Hand it over.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.317
Why?

28:48.320 --> 28:49.514
I'm gonna flush it.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.852
They're gonna find it.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.782
And then we're screwed.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.424
Give it to me.

28:57.430 --> 28:59.022
Let me get rid of it.

28:59.030 --> 29:02.830
What happened in
that room, ian?

29:02.840 --> 29:05.161
Come on.

29:05.170 --> 29:06.808
Before we get caught.

29:25.590 --> 29:28.081
Finley?

29:32.370 --> 29:34.964
You heard
what he said, right?

29:34.970 --> 29:37.268
About meg?

29:37.270 --> 29:40.603
Yeah, I heard that.

29:40.610 --> 29:42.601
When you-you
grabbed your gun,

29:42.610 --> 29:44.202
You took something.
What was it?

29:47.780 --> 29:50.544
An id badge.

29:52.650 --> 29:54.083
I'm guessing that's not

29:54.090 --> 29:56.957
His real name, huh?

29:56.960 --> 30:00.726
You believe your sister
was involved?

30:00.730 --> 30:03.290
Let's go ask her.

30:25.820 --> 30:28.015
Man: The soldiers are
in our posse55ion.
(phone beeps)

30:29.590 --> 30:31.182
I'm going to take
this other call.

30:31.190 --> 30:33.078
You need to trace it.
Man: Yes, Sir.

30:33.090 --> 30:34.785
(phone beeps)

30:34.800 --> 30:37.325
Jonas, where are you?

30:37.330 --> 30:40.128
I did not sign up
for what happened today.

30:40.130 --> 30:42.018
I know things got a bit ugly.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.496
You did fine.

30:43.500 --> 30:44.637
I'm proud of you.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.801
My job was to monitor those men.

30:46.810 --> 30:48.459
Control their condition.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.970
You said when I came
to work for you,

30:49.980 --> 30:51.106
It'd be about the science.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.771
Today was not science.

30:52.780 --> 30:56.272
What you want those men to do
for you is not science.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.168
You've been through something.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.885
Let me come to you,
we can talk.

30:59.890 --> 31:02.381
You have those soldiers,
that's what you want.

31:02.390 --> 31:03.687
Now, please,

31:03.690 --> 31:06.056
Leave me alone.
Where are you, jonas?

31:06.060 --> 31:07.425
I'm gone.

31:10.630 --> 31:12.154
(sighs)

31:12.170 --> 31:13.694
Did you get that?

31:13.700 --> 31:15.964
I'm sorry, sir. He rerouted it.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.654
He will kill you, ian,
he will kill you.

31:36.660 --> 31:38.912
Do you understand me?
He will end your life.

31:38.930 --> 31:41.922
Now, I know you're angry, I
know you're angry. I know why.

31:41.930 --> 31:43.898
But you do not want
to die here, ian.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.720
(door opens)
beth ann, help me.

31:45.730 --> 31:48.096
He was going after the guard.
Help me get this blade from him.

31:48.100 --> 31:50.193
Ian, ian, look at me.
Stop! Look at me.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.566
Look at me.
It's okay.

31:52.570 --> 31:55.403
Ian, stop. Let go.

31:55.410 --> 31:57.469
Come on.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.077
It's your
secret service agent.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.785
He's the one making this happen.

32:11.020 --> 32:13.580
It's gonna be
okay. Okay?

32:13.590 --> 32:16.081
It's all right.
I got him.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.122
Hurst!

32:22.140 --> 32:24.131
Hurst, can you hear me?

32:24.140 --> 32:28.531
I don't believe you'd want this.
They must be making you do this.

32:28.540 --> 32:30.076
You want me
to believe you're bad,

32:30.080 --> 32:32.640
Then come_out here
and prove it to me.

32:34.050 --> 32:35.347
Hurst!

32:38.990 --> 32:41.242
Kyle doesn't believe
I'm in on it,

32:41.260 --> 32:43.114
You're kinda screwed, right?

32:43.120 --> 32:45.054
We're both "kinda" screwed.

32:46.430 --> 32:48.955
So what do you want
me to do about it?

32:48.960 --> 32:50.552
Convince him you're in on it,

32:50.560 --> 32:53.688
Or I have no more use
for you or your daughter.

33:00.570 --> 33:01.730
Hurst...

33:07.610 --> 33:10.613
You are not my family.

33:10.620 --> 33:12.076
You never_were
my family.

33:12.090 --> 33:14.240
You were a job.

33:14.250 --> 33:17.413
This is my job now.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.855
What?

33:20.860 --> 33:24.421
'cause I took you fishing,
you thought I was your dad?

33:26.470 --> 33:29.496
Now give me that blade
before I take it from you.

33:33.540 --> 33:36.532
You make me _come
out here again...

33:36.540 --> 33:38.076
It will be bad.

33:55.900 --> 33:58.653
Francis:
Put him back
in the hole.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.558
I'll take that
blade, mr. Hurst.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.394
Oh!

34:03.400 --> 34:04.697
(gun cocks)

34:08.570 --> 34:11.277
Now you can put me
back in the hole.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.871
Dunn:
No more lies. Who is he?

34:18.890 --> 34:21.142
Meg:
He used to
work for me.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.980
Where did you
get this?

34:22.990 --> 34:24.252
The fact that
I have it

34:24.260 --> 34:26.216
Means he's connected
to the kidnapping.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.254
You saw him?

34:27.260 --> 34:29.478
You're not surprised
that I have this?

34:29.500 --> 34:31.149
No.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.265
That's not his
real name, is it?

34:37.040 --> 34:38.894
What exactly did he do for you?

34:38.910 --> 34:42.107
My company's pharmaceutical
division had a contract

34:42.110 --> 34:44.032
_ With the central
intelligence agency.

34:44.040 --> 34:47.373
And jonas...
Ran that contract.

34:47.380 --> 34:50.247
No, I said what exactly
did he do for you?

34:50.250 --> 34:53.447
Exactly, I don't know.

34:53.450 --> 34:56.954
It was a classified project,
and I didn't have clearance.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.450
Why did he stop working for you?

34:58.460 --> 35:00.428
The project went bad.

35:00.430 --> 35:04.526
And I had to keep my
company clean of it.

35:04.530 --> 35:06.088
Jonas was connected to it,

35:06.100 --> 35:09.968
So I severed that
relationship.

35:09.970 --> 35:11.289
Severed. . .

35:11.310 --> 35:14.063
The relationship with jonas.

35:14.070 --> 35:18.029
Does your husband know
you're screwing him?

35:18.050 --> 35:20.006
No, my husband doesn't know.

35:21.210 --> 35:24.714
To protect yourself,
to jeopardize amber.

35:24.720 --> 35:27.917
Of everything you've ever done,
of all the things you've taken,

35:27.920 --> 35:29.956
This is the worst.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.087
Susie, I didn't know
about this until yesterday.

35:32.090 --> 35:35.287
And what were you planning
on doing about it?

35:35.300 --> 35:37.951
I did something about it.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.790
I tracked him down.

35:39.800 --> 35:42.098
He's been off the grid

35:42.100 --> 35:45.069
For about six months,
but I found his wife.

35:50.310 --> 35:52.335
Susie, I know you
don't trust me,

35:52.350 --> 35:55.899
But everything I've ever
done, I've done for amber.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.559
(gasps)

36:17.200 --> 36:19.134
Hey...

36:19.140 --> 36:21.506
You had us all scared.

36:21.510 --> 36:22.863
How you feeling?

36:22.880 --> 36:24.302
I think okay.

36:24.310 --> 36:25.937
Just tired.

36:25.950 --> 36:27.599
You should rest.

36:27.610 --> 36:31.774
Mr. Gibson... I dreamt
you were one of them.

36:32.990 --> 36:34.548
They listened to you,

36:34.560 --> 36:37.381
And you told
them what to do.

36:37.390 --> 36:39.051
Crazy, right?

36:39.060 --> 36:40.857
(chuckles)

36:45.570 --> 36:48.198
Now we tell olsen.

36:49.340 --> 36:50.534
No.

36:50.540 --> 36:53.464
No?

36:53.470 --> 36:57.304
Finley, what you said to me
about me and partners, I...

36:59.380 --> 37:01.575
That's not what I want to say.

37:01.580 --> 37:04.879
What I want
to say is

37:04.890 --> 37:08.246
We need to find those kids...

37:08.260 --> 37:12.412
So... You need
to know the facts.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.455
Okay.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.656
Amber isn't meg's daughter.

37:17.660 --> 37:21.767
Keep going. You can do it.

37:21.770 --> 37:23.567
I can do what?

37:23.570 --> 37:26.903
You want to trust me,
then trust me.

37:26.910 --> 37:28.764
Go ahead. You can do it.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.099
Say it.

37:33.780 --> 37:35.805
Amber is my daughter.

37:40.890 --> 37:44.189
If the fbi finds out about that,
they'll have your badge.

37:44.190 --> 37:47.956
Yup, they will.

37:47.960 --> 37:50.292
So this stays
between you and me.

37:52.770 --> 37:53.828
Okay.

37:56.070 --> 37:57.389
Now we call olsen.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.833
Now we call olsen.

38:04.310 --> 38:08.007
take control
of who you are...

38:09.450 --> 38:10.940
I shouldn't have pushed you.

38:10.950 --> 38:14.317
Into calling out hurst?

38:14.320 --> 38:16.311
It's better I know
the truth, right?

38:16.320 --> 38:21.428
take control of who you are

38:21.430 --> 38:23.125
'cause ain't nobody
gonna save you...

38:23.130 --> 38:25.894
You! Now!

38:25.900 --> 38:28.266
Dunn:
That must be clarenbach's wife

38:28.270 --> 38:31.933
Natalie:
Your family has a real
thing for wrecking my home.

38:31.940 --> 38:33.703
First your sister,
now you.

38:34.970 --> 38:37.473
Come on in.

38:37.480 --> 38:40.677
Francis:
Honey, I don't know
what you had to do,

38:40.680 --> 38:43.148
But they're letting us
talk to you as a reward.

38:43.150 --> 38:45.118
Oh, here's beth ann.
We're really proud of you.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.348
Stay strong.
Here she, here she is.

38:46.350 --> 38:48.284
It's your mom.

38:48.290 --> 38:49.848
Mom?

38:49.860 --> 38:53.182
I can't believe I'm actually
talking to you.

38:54.260 --> 38:56.319
I miss you so much.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.190
when it comes apart

39:00.200 --> 39:02.964
you start again

39:02.970 --> 39:08.863
and open up your heart...

39:08.880 --> 39:10.973
Everyone...

39:10.980 --> 39:13.369
Die.

39:13.380 --> 39:15.769
Now!

39:15.780 --> 39:19.318
Ian:
Hey. Are you using?

39:19.320 --> 39:22.847
What do you want?

39:22.860 --> 39:24.885
What do you got?

39:26.830 --> 39:32.188
underneath the skies

39:32.200 --> 39:35.397
you will see
a little clearer...

39:36.670 --> 39:38.797
Boss?

39:38.810 --> 39:40.664
take control of who you are

39:40.670 --> 39:43.400
My wife did
a horrific thing today

39:43.410 --> 39:45.799
So that we could get
into widener's phone.

39:50.820 --> 39:53.277
To protect our daughter--
that's why she did it.

39:55.390 --> 39:57.654
So tell me you were able

39:57.660 --> 39:59.582
To monitor widener's
secure communications.

39:59.590 --> 40:02.684
_ Iwas. He'll
figure out we've

40:02.700 --> 40:04.224
Been in there
and shut it down.

40:04.230 --> 40:06.869
By then,
it'll be too late.

40:06.870 --> 40:08.861
So where are
the soldiers?

40:08.870 --> 40:11.088
_ Widener called a
Cla medical transport

40:11.100 --> 40:12.590
At these
coordinates.

40:12.610 --> 40:16.262
They're headed
to a black site.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.077
Send them
new coordinates, please.

40:18.080 --> 40:20.036
(typing)

40:20.050 --> 40:22.006
take control of who you are

40:23.020 --> 40:25.739
Got an encrypted
route change.

40:25.750 --> 40:27.012
Then change the route.

40:29.020 --> 40:31.386
Let koz know
they're heading his way.

40:31.390 --> 40:32.880
when it comes apart

40:32.890 --> 40:36.792
you start again

40:36.800 --> 40:40.520
open up your heart

40:40.530 --> 40:42.521
What do you think's
gonna happen to us?

40:42.540 --> 40:43.859
For taking
those soldiers?
Yeah.

40:43.870 --> 40:45.565
The cia had a agent
in that clinic.

40:45.570 --> 40:48.630
They are in no position
to press on this.

40:48.640 --> 40:51.438
Dunn, look at this.
These are those

40:51.450 --> 40:55.500
Two soldiers with jonas
clarenbach and francis gibson.

40:58.780 --> 41:00.384
These are the two guys
who are gonna kill

41:00.390 --> 41:03.279
Innocent people in dc.

41:03.290 --> 41:06.714
So is gibson the hostage
or the kidnapper?

41:25.850 --> 41:28.341
There's a downed
power line up ahead.

41:28.350 --> 41:30.910
Gonna hold you fellas
up here just a minute.

41:32.820 --> 41:36.244
(four gunshots)

41:36.260 --> 41:38.854
and when it comes apart

41:40.760 --> 41:45.356
and when it comes apart,
you start again.

41:45.370 --> 41:47.588
Enemy neutralized.
The soldiers are secure.

41:47.600 --> 41:50.433
You have them, boss.

41:50.440 --> 41:52.465
Then it was worth it.

41:52.470 --> 41:55.109
What she did.

41:55.110 --> 41:57.931
It was worth it.

41:57.940 --> 41:59.999
