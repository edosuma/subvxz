        over here?              

06:28.888 --> 06:31.155
              Oh, the cake      
        is a surprise, Archie.  

06:31.157 --> 06:33.391
    I'm gonna take it           
    over there later.           

06:33.393 --> 06:35.326
Thanks, Mr. Lorenzo.            
That was real nice of you.      

06:35.328 --> 06:36.827
              Oh, <i>non fa niente,</i>
                 Lionel.        

06:36.829 --> 06:38.596
            I'm only sorry      
        that I won't be there   

06:38.598 --> 06:41.232
 to see the ecstasy on your face
      when you bite into it.    

06:41.234 --> 06:42.633
Oh, why?                        
Can't you make the party?       

06:42.635 --> 06:44.302
             No, I'm afraid not,
                Lionel.         

06:44.304 --> 06:46.170
             Irene and I have to
             rush down to Miami.

06:46.172 --> 06:50.041
     Our oldest boy, Tony, broke
     his leg at a football game.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.675
      Oh, that's                
    too bad.                    

06:51.677 --> 06:53.711
         I didn't know          
your son played football.       

06:53.713 --> 06:56.414
He don't. He was just running   
        to get a good seat.     

06:58.583 --> 07:00.151
                  Did I have him
                      fooled?   

07:00.153 --> 07:03.254
                     Ha, ha, ha!
        Don't poke me, huh?     

07:04.789 --> 07:07.225
 No. Don't worry. Tony's fine.  
      I was just kidding.       

07:07.227 --> 07:08.559
Oh, that's good.                

07:08.561 --> 07:10.361
         But we have to get away
             for the weekend.   

07:10.363 --> 07:12.096
    A sales convention          
I promised to attend.           

07:12.098 --> 07:13.664
Sorry, Lionel.                  
                  No, it's okay.

07:13.666 --> 07:15.233
      Which reminds me.         

07:15.235 --> 07:17.235
    Did you hear about          
          the salesman          

07:17.237 --> 07:19.970
who was crossing the field      
and got chased by a bull?       

07:19.972 --> 07:21.506
    No. What happened?          

07:21.508 --> 07:25.809
  It was the first time a bull  
    ever threw the salesman.    

07:27.513 --> 07:29.747
    Ain't that awful?           

07:31.316 --> 07:34.452
                 Ha, ha, ha, ha!
      Stop poking me, huh?      

07:34.454 --> 07:37.955
            That joke is exactly
            100 years old today.

         So, everybody,

      Hey, Lionel, where's      
  your Uncle Henry moving to?   

08:17.497 --> 08:19.830
  Oh, he's opening a cleaning   
  store up in Dutchess County.  

08:19.832 --> 08:21.132
     What? Dutchess County?     

08:21.134 --> 08:23.000
        They ain't gonna        
let your uncle in there, Lionel.

08:23.002 --> 08:26.204
        Dutchess County         
  don't even let the Heebs in.  

08:26.206 --> 08:27.938
         Well, when we          
        get there,              

08:27.940 --> 08:30.308
          we gonna let          
a whole bunch of them in.       

08:30.310 --> 08:32.510
        Here are                
      the cookies.              

08:32.511 --> 08:34.278
        Oh, thanks, Mrs. Bunker.
             See you later.     

08:34.280 --> 08:36.679
And besides, Lionel, where      
 would your uncle get the cash  

08:36.682 --> 08:38.416
to go into business             
    for himself?                

08:38.418 --> 08:40.485
      Oh, that's easy. He's been
      saving his welfare checks.

08:40.486 --> 08:42.720
         What, Lionel?          

08:42.722 --> 08:44.688
    Are you telling me          
      he's been doing that      

08:44.690 --> 08:46.324
    while he's working          
    at the same time?           

08:46.326 --> 08:49.660
Sure. Don't you read the papers?
  That's how we all get rich.   

08:56.135 --> 08:58.869
            That kid, he's never
              gonna be serious  

08:58.871 --> 09:00.605
                 as long as that
                    he lives.   

09:00.607 --> 09:02.206
            But I wonder, Edith,

09:02.208 --> 09:05.109
 where would his Uncle Henry get
enough cash to go into business?

09:05.111 --> 09:08.746
  Maybe God doesn't like him,   
      so he made him rich.      

09:08.748 --> 09:11.349
         Who asked you?         

09:11.351 --> 09:13.518
    If you went to the party,   
        you could ask him.      

09:13.520 --> 09:14.652
            Oh, no.             

09:14.654 --> 09:16.187
      I ain't setting foot      
          in no house           

09:16.189 --> 09:17.721

         of that house          

09:17.723 --> 09:20.124
      don't wanna set foot      
         in this house.         

09:20.126 --> 09:21.159
                    Oh, come on,
                    Daddy.      

09:21.161 --> 09:22.460
            Now's the perfect   
                  opportunity   

09:22.462 --> 09:24.228
     for you and Lionel's father
        to get together.        

09:24.230 --> 09:26.564
    What's so perfect about     
  getting together with a guy   

09:26.566 --> 09:29.700
that treats me as if I was      
the one who was the colored guy?

09:31.870 --> 09:34.705
      Edith, look at this toast.
        It's stone cold.        

09:34.707 --> 09:36.240
     Oh, I'm sorry, Archie.     

09:36.242 --> 09:38.042
  It was warm when I made it.   

09:44.216 --> 09:45.849
      That would have been      
          a good time           

09:45.851 --> 09:47.918
    to serve it to me, then,    
          huh, Edith?           

09:47.920 --> 09:50.888
No. You weren't                 
  awake then.                   

09:53.625 --> 09:55.159
                  I'm awake now.

09:55.161 --> 09:58.028
Yeah, I know.                   

10:00.666 --> 10:02.733
                  Get hot toast!

10:02.735 --> 10:05.503
        Yeah. Right away,       
                Archie.         

10:05.505 --> 10:09.006
Daddy, do you have to treat Ma  
    like she was a slave?       

10:09.008 --> 10:10.408
                  I treat her   
            like a housewife.

                     Come in.   

10:16.649 --> 10:19.350
        Is there something wrong
            with the cookies?   

10:19.352 --> 10:21.985
  No, Edith. The cookies        
      are just fine.            

10:21.987 --> 10:23.854
         It's George            
that's giving me the problem.   

10:23.856 --> 10:25.122
            What do you mean?   

10:25.124 --> 10:28.492
Well, I thought I could         
get away with it just this once.

10:28.494 --> 10:32.396
But he says no integrated       
parties in his house.           

10:32.398 --> 10:33.631
                          Oh.   

10:33.633 --> 10:35.233
Oh, I wish there was            
some other place                

10:35.235 --> 10:36.834
we could have the party.

10:58.090 --> 11:00.458
        but Louise

11:15.742 --> 11:18.976
I'm so glad                     
to hear you say that,           

11:18.978 --> 11:22.613
because I told Louise she could 
have the party over here.

              You told her that?

11:38.030 --> 11:40.964
Well, get on the blower there   
          and untell her.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.538
          What crisis?

When are you gonna              
wake up to facts, Archie?

Black people are coming on      

12:08.761 --> 12:10.795
economically, politically       
and socially.                   

12:10.797 --> 12:12.229
The tide has turned.            

12:12.231 --> 12:14.998
That's what I mean when I say   
that the crisis is over.        

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
                 Will you turn  
            that record over?   

12:17.002 --> 12:18.602
                 And will you do
                 what I tell ya?

12:18.604 --> 12:20.805
     Call them and tell them    
 they can't have the party here.

18:24.236 --> 18:27.204
    The women serving it up     
and the men eating it up.       

18:27.206 --> 18:28.438
          Ha, ha, ha!           

18:28.440 --> 18:32.009
      And look who's first      
    on the line here.           

18:32.011 --> 18:34.945
    Oh, oh. Come on,            
Mr. Liberal, huh?               

18:34.947 --> 18:36.546
How about a little              
equal rights                    

18:36.548 --> 18:38.248
with the serving spoon          
      here, huh?                

18:38.250 --> 18:39.516
Look at him                     
heaping his plate.              

18:39.518 --> 18:41.719
What, have you got friends      
on the porch?                   

18:43.654 --> 18:46.690
         I still think          
    George will come.           

18:46.692 --> 18:49.760
        After all,              
     he's your own brother.     

18:49.762 --> 18:51.929
            Uh, I don't think   
         he's gonna come, Edith.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.464
 He just ain't got none of that,
        what do you call,       

18:54.466 --> 18:56.734
      family unconscious,       
        you know?               

18:56.736 --> 18:59.069
  Hey, wait a minute.           
    Wait a minute.              

18:59.071 --> 19:00.470
What do you mean                
by that, Bunker?                

19:00.472 --> 19:01.739
                I didn't mean   
                  nothing wrong.

19:01.741 --> 19:05.042
         I just meant what      
  your own Black Panther leader,

19:05.044 --> 19:08.245
             what do you call,  
        Elder Cleavage, said.   

19:09.313 --> 19:11.615
                 I mean, he was 
            the guy that said   

19:11.617 --> 19:14.818
      that your black families, 
     like, they all shot to hell

19:14.820 --> 19:16.386
              because you're all
                on the streets  

19:16.388 --> 19:17.788
                    when you're 
                10 years old.   

19:17.790 --> 19:19.189
            That's what he said.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.225
         How are you gonna      
raise a family on the streets   

19:21.227 --> 19:22.559
                    with no beds
                     or toilets?

19:25.964 --> 19:27.597
    Why are you looking at me   
            that way?           

19:27.599 --> 19:30.968
                    Did I say   
                something wrong?

19:30.970 --> 19:33.370
 Bunker, you know more          
  about black people            

19:33.372 --> 19:36.073
than anybody                    
I ever met.                     

19:36.075 --> 19:37.908
    Are you sure                
that somewhere inside           

19:37.910 --> 19:40.911
you don't have one teensy,      
weensy drop of black blood?     

19:40.913 --> 19:42.980
            Come on. I ain't got
              none of that. No. 

19:42.982 --> 19:45.715
         Then how come          
    you got kinky eyebrows?     

19:51.489 --> 19:53.623
                I ain't got     
                 kinky eyebrows.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.893
            I got my Uncle Roy's
                  eyebrows.     

19:55.895 --> 19:58.028
              And I ain't got   
          colored blood, Lionel.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.330
         Yes, you have,         
            Archie.             

20:00.332 --> 20:01.464
                        What?   

20:01.466 --> 20:03.967
        It's red.               

20:05.503 --> 20:09.239
              Go on over there  
            and mingle, will ya?

20:09.241 --> 20:10.640
                The whole point 
              I'm trying to make

20:10.642 --> 20:12.910
        is that, uh, you take   
             these things like, 

20:12.912 --> 20:14.978
            what do you call,   
                loyal and love. 

20:14.980 --> 20:18.916
    Well, your colored families,
     they don't feel them things

20:18.918 --> 20:20.250
             like your colorless
                  families.     

20:21.319 --> 20:22.352
HENRY:                          
Listen.                         

20:22.354 --> 20:25.122
I got something to say.         

20:25.124 --> 20:26.423
    Now, gather round,          
        everybody.              

20:26.425 --> 20:28.192
     I'm gonna make a toast     
        to Archie.              

20:28.194 --> 20:30.460
EDITH: Oh!                      
                ARCHIE: Yeah.   

20:30.462 --> 20:31.862
GLORIA:                         
A toast for my daddy.           

20:31.864 --> 20:34.865
  It's been a great experience  
     living on this street      

20:34.867 --> 20:36.099
          and watching          
     this wonderful family      

20:36.101 --> 20:37.301
        of Edith, Gloria        
              and Mike.         

20:37.303 --> 20:38.401
        I wanna thank you,      
                Bunker,         

20:38.403 --> 20:40.838
      for letting me know       
    and letting me see          

20:40.840 --> 20:44.607
that some white folks are better
    than other white folks.     

20:52.583 --> 20:55.986
  Well, I wish the whole world  
    could learn that.           

20:55.988 --> 20:58.655
        Archie, why don't you   
        toast Henry now?        

20:58.657 --> 20:59.789
             Oh, all right,     
                I will.         

20:59.791 --> 21:01.024
                    GEORGE:     
              Oh, no, you don't.

21:01.026 --> 21:03.126
    Ain't nobody making no toast
        to my brother but me.   

21:03.128 --> 21:04.694
Who the hell is that?           
                That's Pop.     

21:04.696 --> 21:05.695
Oh!                             

21:05.697 --> 21:07.097
        Let me get that.        

21:07.099 --> 21:08.899
    Get away from that door,    
Meathead. Get over there.       

21:08.901 --> 21:09.900
Archie, let him in.             

21:09.902 --> 21:11.801
            Edith, Edith.       
                Back. Back.     

21:11.803 --> 21:13.937
    I'll handle this.           

21:13.939 --> 21:16.473
 Hey, Jefferson, are you asking 
     to come into my house?     

21:16.475 --> 21:17.774
                     No, Bunker.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.977
    I wouldn't come in there,   
        not even if you got down

21:19.979 --> 21:22.913
         on your hands and knees
            and sang "Mammy."   

21:24.215 --> 21:25.815
        Hey, Jefferson,         
 I don't blame your kid brother 

21:25.817 --> 21:26.984
for leaving home.               

21:26.986 --> 21:28.852
If I was your brother,          
 I'd leave home too.            

21:28.854 --> 21:32.189
          If you was my brother,
            I'd cut my throat.  

21:32.191 --> 21:34.925
If I was your brother,          
I'd give you the knife.         

21:34.927 --> 21:36.426
                 Oh, come on in,
                    Pop.        

21:36.428 --> 21:37.961
     GEORGE: Save your breath,  
              Lionel.           

21:37.963 --> 21:40.830
 I wouldn't come in there if he 
was the last white man on earth.

21:40.832 --> 21:43.100
  Aha! Watch this.              
    Watch this.                 

21:43.102 --> 21:44.902
  Ha-ha! You're in.             

21:44.904 --> 21:46.403
                    No, I ain't.
                      I'm out.  

21:46.405 --> 21:49.106
If you're on my stoop, that's   
the same as being in my house.  

21:49.108 --> 21:50.240
             Stoops don't count.

21:50.242 --> 21:51.841
Stoops always count.            

21:51.843 --> 21:53.777
         Stoops never count.    
     Don't turn your back on me.

21:53.779 --> 21:55.112
Oh, there you are.              
    That's in.                  

21:55.114 --> 21:57.847
  Now you're in.                
You're in for sure.             

21:57.849 --> 21:59.749
    So, finally,                
the great Jefferson,            

21:59.751 --> 22:02.786
 who always reclined            
to cross my threshold           

22:02.788 --> 22:04.054
is into the house,              

22:04.056 --> 22:05.055
    all duded up                

22:05.057 --> 22:06.456
with a flower                   
in his lapel there.             

22:06.458 --> 22:08.892
Or is that one of them things   
that squirt in your eye?        

22:08.894 --> 22:10.928
            No, it's real.      

22:11.996 --> 22:13.763
    I wear a fresh one          
        every day.              

22:13.765 --> 22:17.034
Ah! You don't blow money        
on a fresh flower every day.    

22:17.036 --> 22:20.703
    No! I steal one every day   
    from a blind flower girl.   

22:20.705 --> 22:22.039
                  He's joking.  

22:22.041 --> 22:23.873
    George, they don't          
         know you here.         

22:23.875 --> 22:25.008
          He's joking.          

22:25.010 --> 22:26.776
                         Louise.

22:27.912 --> 22:30.113
                 I'll tell them 
                when I'm joking.

22:30.115 --> 22:32.049
                I was joking.   

22:33.884 --> 22:36.486
Bunker, I'm just gonna say      
what I have to say to my brother

22:36.488 --> 22:37.587
                  and get out.  

22:37.589 --> 22:39.689
I'll gladly hold                
the door for you.               

22:40.925 --> 22:42.559
                          Henry,

22:42.561 --> 22:45.662
  when I was a kid, I was always
     asking Mom for a brother.  

22:45.664 --> 22:47.464
                    You know    
                how poor we was.

22:47.466 --> 22:49.666
          So all we could afford
                 was you.       

22:49.668 --> 22:51.801
          Oh, George!           
         He's kidding.          

22:51.803 --> 22:53.870
             He's kidding.      

22:55.773 --> 22:58.375
                      Louise.   

22:58.377 --> 23:01.678
        Never interrupt a man   
            when he's toasting. 

23:01.680 --> 23:03.746
                    Henry,      
              all kidding aside,

23:03.748 --> 23:06.950
                the trouble with
                 being a brother

23:06.952 --> 23:10.454
              is that sometimes 
            you can't always say

23:10.456 --> 23:12.356
                 the things     
        that you really feel.   

23:12.358 --> 23:15.993
You know, like how good it is to
 have somebody around to rap to 

23:15.995 --> 23:19.762
          or somebody           
    to kind of pick you up,     

23:19.764 --> 23:21.198
  you know, when you're so low  

23:21.200 --> 23:23.300
that you have to reach up       
        to touch bottom.        

23:23.302 --> 23:25.502
         Well, you know         
I'm not much of a talker.       

23:25.504 --> 23:29.239
     But there's one thing      
     that needs to be said.     

23:29.241 --> 23:31.741
          I love you,           
            brother.            

23:31.743 --> 23:33.110
Oh, man, you're always          
doing that.                     

23:33.112 --> 23:34.478
Stealing everything             
that's mine.                    

23:34.480 --> 23:35.778
                    Say what?   

23:35.780 --> 23:38.015
I was gonna toast               
those very words to you myself. 

23:38.017 --> 23:38.948
                             Ah!

23:42.253 --> 23:44.988
            Black families      
     don't feel love, huh, Arch?

23:44.990 --> 23:47.724
Why is it you can always        
remember everything             

23:47.726 --> 23:50.360
except how to work?             

23:52.530 --> 23:54.731
 Wasn't that                    
a nice toast?                   

23:54.733 --> 23:56.466
Yeah, it was                    
    all right.                  

23:56.468 --> 23:57.867
You better believe              
it was all right.               

23:57.869 --> 24:01.171
            I thought           
    it was a nice toast.        

24:01.173 --> 24:04.241
      I'm just sorry it had to  
    take place in a honky house.

         See you later.         
We're going to the movies.      

24:15.921 --> 24:17.054
All right.                      

24:17.056 --> 24:18.655
Hey, Arch. What do you think?   
             Nice, huh?         

24:18.657 --> 24:20.990
The sort of way George Jefferson
        was wearing one,        

24:20.992 --> 24:22.392
                  I thought     
            I'd wear one myself.

24:24.562 --> 24:28.298
    Oh, well, if that ain't     
      a dumb Polack move.       

24:29.833 --> 24:33.570
     On a used war surplus      
        fatigue jacket,         

24:33.572 --> 24:35.805
      he pins a carnation.      

24:35.807 --> 24:37.107
                 That's how much
                    you know.   

24:37.109 --> 24:39.809
    See, that's not a carnation.
        That's a water lily.    

25:02.833 --> 25:06.269
             [♪]                

25:06.271 --> 25:10.340
