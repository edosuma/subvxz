WEBVTT

00:10.720 --> 00:11.926
Previously on "Power"...

00:12.080 --> 00:14.242
All that money I found
in your place, Tommy,

00:14.400 --> 00:16.562
- that's not from the club.
- I'm a drug dealer.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.961
This D.A. has a bunch of cases
under judicial review.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.924
- That's why you're getting out fast.
- When?

00:21.120 --> 00:23.566
Leave Isabel alone, Nomar.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.085
Looks like you're cleaning house.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.242
While you're eliminating
the competition?

00:27.400 --> 00:29.129
I saw Simon Stern today.
It went great.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.567
- Vegas, Miami.
- Mm, I like Miami.

00:32.759 --> 00:33.921
If Tasha ever found out,

00:34.080 --> 00:35.809
she'd blow up your family
and our whole game.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.930
I got you a little something myself.
I hope it makes you smile.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.924
Celebrating my High Holy Day
and this puta sticks me.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.650
- The hitter was a girl?
- We find this girl,

00:43.800 --> 00:45.006
we find out who's been hitting us.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.924
Try to get yourself near
Ruiz and his top guys

00:47.080 --> 00:48.445
when they're talking business.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.443
Especially if they mention
Lobos or the distributor.

00:50.600 --> 00:51.886
Who's the blanquito
in there with Ruiz?

00:52.040 --> 00:55.010
That's the guy who gets us
the products. Distro.

02:25.200 --> 02:33.200
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

02:39.520 --> 02:42.444
- Your party was over the top, T.
- Sure was.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.210
I'm still trying to work through
that vodka hangover.

02:44.360 --> 02:47.170
- Oh, God.
- What did your husband get you again?

02:47.320 --> 02:50.051
He got her that new Celine Tote,
like Kanye got Kim.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.124
And then something
a little more stimulating,

02:53.280 --> 02:54.691
if you know what I mean.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.366
So your man delivers
in accessories and in bed?

02:57.520 --> 03:00.046
Shit, Tasha,
that's a goddamn fairy tale.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.765
- That's what I said.
- It's just a life, y'all.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.888
It's got its ups and downs
like everybody else's.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.281
I want to know how he proposed.
I'm taking notes.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.885
All right, well, take notes,
'cause I'm gonna tell the story.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.844
It's my favorite story.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.771
You know, basically,
she was still a kid.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.406
And one day, they were driving
down the New Jersey Turnpike.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.245
- No, it was the BQE.
- Okay, whatever.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.927
And then the cops pulled them over.
So he leans in and he's like,

03:22.080 --> 03:24.082
"Yo, I got a piece in the car."

03:24.240 --> 03:26.686
- Why did he have a gun?
- For protection.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.047
You know how the hood was.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.567
It was in the glove compartment.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.449
As the cop's walking up,

03:33.600 --> 03:36.763
I take it out, put it in my purse.

03:36.920 --> 03:40.641
Cop searches him,
he searched the car, found nothing.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.600
Cop walks up to me,
eyeballs me.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.967
I was never so scared in my life.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.924
And then what happened?

03:50.640 --> 03:53.166
He just walks away.
I don't know why.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.685
I still don't know why.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.166
We drove away,
didn't talk about it.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.210
I didn't even cry
until we got home.

03:59.360 --> 04:03.809
Two days later,
he gives me this ring.

04:03.960 --> 04:07.009
- You a stone-cold bitch, T.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.443
Ride or die.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.041
Well, you know, he said
he knew he could trust me.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.487
He knew
he had my complete loyalty.

04:15.640 --> 04:18.120
And I said
as long as he gave me the same,

04:18.320 --> 04:19.845
we'd be together forever.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.649
I love that story.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.121
It's like the first time
every time I hear that story.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.330
Now we got to figure out
how to get you a man

04:27.480 --> 04:28.766
and a house and a ring,

04:28.920 --> 04:31.287
'cause you didn't even understand
why he had a gun in the car.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.169
I still don't understand
why he needed that gun.

05:19.320 --> 05:23.120
Thanks for meeting me here.
I couldn't make it all the way uptown.

05:23.280 --> 05:27.205
I still wanted to see you.
I prefer my apartment,

05:27.360 --> 05:30.364
but being here has certain benefits,

05:30.520 --> 05:33.171
like room service.

05:38.280 --> 05:39.645
Mmm.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.451
God,
I wish I could stay here all day.

05:48.840 --> 05:52.561
I don't want to go out there
to the real world.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.163
This, us, is real...

05:59.320 --> 06:01.049
woman.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.403
You feel that way, too, right?

06:06.480 --> 06:07.845
Hmm?

06:15.720 --> 06:17.768
It's okay.
You can get it.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.045
I'll call her back.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.811
What's she like?

06:30.960 --> 06:33.850
Well, Tasha is...

06:39.280 --> 06:40.964
not you.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.685
Hmm?

07:05.080 --> 07:07.765
Oh, good, I'm glad you're here.

07:07.920 --> 07:11.003
Do you mind if I borrow
your black leather jacket?

07:11.200 --> 07:14.170
What?
It's Tuesday, laundry day.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.164
- Should I have called first?
- Why start now?

07:19.320 --> 07:21.163
No smoking in it, okay?

07:21.320 --> 07:24.085
I'm still angry about the burn hole
that was in my sweater.

07:24.240 --> 07:28.006
I quit three months ago.
Where you been?

07:28.160 --> 07:29.764
Never mind, I guess I know.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.884
Shit is so much hotter in hotels,
right?

07:33.040 --> 07:35.850
Manny took me to the Marriott once
and let me--

07:37.400 --> 07:39.129
I'm just glad you finally found a way

07:39.280 --> 07:40.964
to get your fireworks with Greg.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.929
I'm not with Greg anymore.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.601
Que qué?

07:46.760 --> 07:48.762
You got some new hot thing
you didn't tell me about?

07:48.920 --> 07:51.161
I didn't know what it was for a while,
so I didn't want to say anything.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.089
What's his name?

07:55.160 --> 07:57.367
- It's Jamie St. Patrick.
- From the old neighborhood?

07:57.520 --> 07:59.841
- I guess I never really let him go.
- I guess not,

08:00.040 --> 08:02.247
no matter how many times
papi chased him out of the house.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.811
He was a punk.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.888
Playing lookout
for those gangsters.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.520
He's changed.
He's not like that anymore.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.521
You got it bad, don't you?

08:15.720 --> 08:17.961
He's a good guy, Paz.
You'll see.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.849
I sure will.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.209
How about dinner?

08:23.360 --> 08:25.567
If he's as great as you say,

08:25.720 --> 08:28.530
it feels like I should remeet
my future cuñado.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.762
- You'll ask him, right?
- I'll ask him.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.810
We are not competition.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.923
We are only old friends.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.448
It should not take you so long
to come to friend for help.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.285
Guns in the sauna.
You Serbians have an interesting way

08:53.440 --> 08:56.011
of defining friendship, Vladimir.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.811
They are overprotective.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.008
What can I say?

09:01.160 --> 09:03.731
Now, tell me, how can I help?

09:04.920 --> 09:08.925
I'm looking for a gun.
Actually, a knife for hire.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.445
A woman.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.966
A white girl, Spanish,

09:16.120 --> 09:17.360
or a black?

09:17.520 --> 09:20.126
Definitely Latin.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.931
I do business with
a Haitian from New Jersey.

09:23.120 --> 09:26.966
You must have conversation
with him, but he is a little...

09:27.120 --> 09:30.283
- interesting.
- You talking about Drift?

09:30.440 --> 09:32.727
I got work with that motherfucker.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.651
If he knew something about this shit,
he should've reached out.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.444
When he and I worked together,

09:37.600 --> 09:40.763
he knew who to call
to eliminate a problem.

09:40.920 --> 09:44.561
If she's out there,
he know about her.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.764
- You heard from Stern?
- No.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.160
What, you getting nervous?

09:51.360 --> 09:52.646
Just want to know what time
this dinner's gonna be.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.802
Men like Stern
are on a plane half the year.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.405
I bet his wife
can't get a hold of him.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.211
- Yeah, good point.
- He was impressed, boss.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.761
Don't worry, we got this.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.968
I can get you two lovebirds a room.

10:04.160 --> 10:07.130
I bet you'd like that.
Come on, get out of here.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.647
We got grown-man business
to talk about.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.290
- I'll let you know if Stern calls.
- Do that.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.165
- You see the Triads?
- Yeah, and the Italians.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.481
Hadn't heard of her,

10:24.680 --> 10:27.081
but the Serb told me
you should talk to Drift.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.288
Aren't we
supposed to meet with Drift, yeah?

10:29.480 --> 10:31.847
As soon as we squash all this shit?
I thought you two were cool, man.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.844
Yeah, you think he would've reached
out if he knew something.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.651
- So either he doesn't know anything--
- Or we're getting played.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.690
Yeah, and there's only one way
to fucking find out, Tommy.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.491
Yeah, we got to go visit him
in his fucked-up house in Jersey.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.564
- Mm-hmm.
- Man, I hate going out there.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.690
- You're driving. Come on.
- I can't go with you, man.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.649
- I got a lot to do for this party.
- Save it.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.644
Look, go tomorrow. Take Julito.
I know he's doing runs today.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.729
Whatever, man.

11:05.720 --> 11:09.611
Angela, we've been waiting for you.

11:09.760 --> 11:13.207
I'm sorry.
It's good to see you again, Mr. Collins.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.402
Good morning.

11:15.560 --> 11:18.404
How do you feel about Detroit?

11:18.560 --> 11:20.324
We're putting together
a border drug unit there,

11:20.480 --> 11:23.290
want someone
of your caliber on board.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.851
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.561
California appears to have made
significant headway in the Lobos case.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.371
An associate of his has been
arrested and might sing.

11:31.520 --> 11:35.525
If he does, they may be ready
to arrest within the week.

11:35.680 --> 11:39.082
They're shutting down
our Lobos task force.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.561
We're shifting funding
to other departments.

11:42.880 --> 11:45.201
My father isn't in good health.

11:45.360 --> 11:48.091
It's not a good time for me
to leave New York.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.728
Frankie said you were ambitious.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.609
I thought you'd jump at the chance

11:53.760 --> 11:55.728
for a successful prosecution.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.450
All right, look.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.809
Barring a huge development
in your Lobos investigation,

12:00.960 --> 12:03.406
I'm gonna need your answer
about Detroit by the end of the week.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.005
Yes, sir.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.971
Is it wet?

12:17.120 --> 12:18.804
It is?

12:18.960 --> 12:21.770
Oh, how wet?

12:21.920 --> 12:23.445
Um, I got to go.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.451
Don't even.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.440
What the fuck?
He was just about to kill the doctor.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.122
Ouch.
Bitch, are you crazy?

12:35.280 --> 12:36.645
You could
lose your job for this shit.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.643
- It's, like, police brutality.
- I told you before.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.326
Nobody cares what I do to you.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.770
You all right, bruja?

12:45.920 --> 12:47.285
Something's got you shook.

12:50.960 --> 12:54.123
All these white boys
look the same to me.

12:54.280 --> 12:58.205
Besides,
these pendejos are small-time.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.011
The hijo de puta you're looking
for ain't gonna be in here.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.844
I gave you his name.
What more do you want?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.561
His picture.
So until you find him, you keep looking.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.840
Mrs. St. Patrick.
Hey, I got here as quick as I could.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.527
I told you.
When we're alone, you can call me Tasha.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.164
So where do you need me to take you,
Tasha?

13:34.320 --> 13:35.970
- That's up to you.
- What?

13:36.120 --> 13:38.043
Look, I've been thinking
about what you said

13:38.200 --> 13:39.929
when you tried
to give me those earrings,

13:40.080 --> 13:43.971
- about Ghost, about loyalty.
- No, no, I didn't mean anything by it.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.083
Sure, you did,

13:49.240 --> 13:50.480
and the way you said it,

13:50.680 --> 13:53.445
seems like my husband
is seeing another woman.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.608
And the way I see it,

13:55.760 --> 13:58.161
if he's stepping out
on our marriage...

14:02.920 --> 14:04.922
...maybe I should, too.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.482
Look,
I know you said what you said

14:10.640 --> 14:13.246
because you care about me

14:13.400 --> 14:15.402
and I care about you, too.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.881
I mean,
don't you think I deserve better

14:18.080 --> 14:20.082
than to be kept in the dark?

14:25.320 --> 14:27.607
You ever been to Detroit?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.724
A couple times. Why?
You trying to go?

14:30.880 --> 14:33.565
Not exactly a vacation spot
this time of year.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.643
What?
No, nothing like that.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.928
You okay?

14:38.080 --> 14:39.525
What's up?

14:41.760 --> 14:44.331
You think you can get out
again this week,

14:44.480 --> 14:46.721
for dinner?

14:46.880 --> 14:50.282
Uh, dinnertime is tough,
because of the kids, you know?

14:50.440 --> 14:54.570
I know, it's just...

14:56.440 --> 15:00.126
my sister found some hotel keys
in one of my pockets.

15:00.280 --> 15:05.081
She asked what was going on,
so I--

15:05.240 --> 15:08.005
- You told her.
- About us.

15:09.560 --> 15:13.451
She wants to have dinner,
see how you turned out.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.525
How is Paz?

15:18.960 --> 15:20.962
ls she still borrowing money?
Hmm?

15:21.120 --> 15:22.485
Never.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.926
Exactly.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.686
I remember her
breaking your piggy bank

15:26.840 --> 15:28.808
so she could buy
some damn Candies.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.171
I want her to see
how much you've changed.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.527
When and where is this dinner,
woman?

15:37.680 --> 15:40.047
Hmm?
I will be there, I promise.

15:40.200 --> 15:44.000
- Day after tomorrow?
- You're lucky I like you.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.481
You sure you want to do this?

15:49.640 --> 15:51.244
I deserve to know what I'm up against.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.322
What are you gonna do?

15:54.480 --> 15:56.642
What you think I'm gonna do?

15:58.160 --> 16:00.686
No, that's not her.
That's not her.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.251
Hmm.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.090
You know her name?

16:07.760 --> 16:09.091
Angela.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.842
Thank you. Good night.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.447
Come here. Hey.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.206
I've seen her before, at the club.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.850
Ghost was talking to her.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.761
He said it was just a
friend from high school.

16:32.920 --> 16:35.764
He told me--
he told me not to trip.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.890
- I saw her, and he--
- Have a good night.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.370
Just take me home.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.721
Look, Tasha, I'm--

16:44.880 --> 16:46.769
Just, please,

16:46.920 --> 16:49.685
take me home.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.526
We need to start over
from the beginning.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.444
Consider Anibal.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.523
Hermanos Taínos are well-connected

16:57.680 --> 16:59.887
and have a lot of territory.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.401
- Dead.
- Soldado Nation's just as connected,

17:02.560 --> 17:04.722
and even though Lobos
told Ruiz to fuck off,

17:04.880 --> 17:06.325
he still made an attempt
at the throne.

17:06.480 --> 17:09.244
And his punishment was being
aired out with a switchblade.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.528
So Anibal is dead,

17:11.680 --> 17:14.126
Ruiz is out, who's next?

17:14.280 --> 17:16.089
We know Hermanos Taínos
and Soldado Nation

17:16.240 --> 17:17.685
are in Ghost's network.

17:17.839 --> 17:21.083
So we need to revisit the geo-profile
to see what other crews

17:21.240 --> 17:22.924
in different boroughs
fit the same criteria.

17:23.079 --> 17:26.050
There are over
200 criminal organizations

17:26.200 --> 17:27.611
in New York City that could apply.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.081
It could take us
days to narrow that list.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.450
I'm sure you've heard the talk
about breaking up this task force.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.443
Frankie and Collins
are out of their fucking minds

17:37.600 --> 17:39.648
if they think I'm leaving this bitch
without getting Lobos.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.450
Me, too.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.125
Not until we're done.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.041
This voodoo zombie shit
freaks me the fuck out.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.802
As you're unfamiliar with our religion,

17:54.960 --> 17:57.406
I will forgive your disrespect.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.641
I was surprised to hear about your...

18:02.600 --> 18:04.170
troubles.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.800
You and Ghost
run a respected network.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.450
Word travels fast.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.490
It made me reconsider
our fledgling partnership.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.962
We'll get this handled.
We'll be back on track to do our thing

18:15.120 --> 18:16.884
if you're straight with me.

18:18.320 --> 18:20.004
I have cousins in Miami.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.009
A few years ago,
they crossed paths

18:22.200 --> 18:23.964
with a female Spanish hitter.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.084
She was good,
put down five people in his crew.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.490
Well, this crew that
your cousins had a beef with,

18:30.640 --> 18:33.120
- you got a name for me?
- Rock Street Killers.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.443
And they're very,
very strong in Florida, too.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.967
Your friend Rolla,
he has street brothers there.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.326
Should I make an offering for you?

18:43.480 --> 18:46.563
- I think you need it.
- No, thanks.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.769
Hey, yo,
you gonna call Ghost?

18:49.920 --> 18:53.083
- Nope.
- No?

18:54.680 --> 18:57.365
Isabela, mi amor...

19:01.440 --> 19:02.771
Hey.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.767
It's not a boy, is it?

19:14.960 --> 19:16.485
It's definitely not a boy, papi.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.160
Jefe, you have a visitor.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.371
Hey.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.011
- I wasn't expecting you.
- I wasn't expecting to be here.

19:34.160 --> 19:35.525
I got pressing business.

19:41.040 --> 19:42.690
I got my crew on the streets
shaking trees.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.490
We got nothing
on that bitch who hit me.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.927
That's what I came to talk about.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.327
I got it on good authority

19:49.480 --> 19:52.245
the people responsible
for hitting us and stabbing you

19:52.400 --> 19:53.890
could be the RSKs.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.405
Could that be?

19:56.400 --> 19:59.131
Soldados and RSK
always had beef.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.964
Rolla's arrogant, headstrong.

20:07.120 --> 20:10.249
I had eyes on him
since all of this started.

20:10.400 --> 20:14.086
He's just the kind of man
that makes a move like this.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.886
Looks you right in the face
and points the finger

20:17.040 --> 20:18.929
in the other direction.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.447
The question is,
will Ghost do what needs doing?

20:21.600 --> 20:23.204
He'll do it.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.010
I just need to talk to him.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.924
He doesn't know?

20:29.120 --> 20:31.327
You came to me first.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.609
Ooh.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.284
We are at a crossroads, hermano,

20:39.440 --> 20:41.169
not just for
everything we've worked for,

20:41.320 --> 20:43.800
but for you.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.407
Change is hard
and sometimes necessary.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.642
Maybe you should
handle this yourself.

20:55.960 --> 20:58.281
Either way...

20:58.480 --> 21:00.244
needs to be put into the dirt.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.851
And if you don't,
there's gonna be

21:02.000 --> 21:05.447
a body dropping
from RSK every day.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.962
What about the Triads in the Bronx?

21:12.160 --> 21:14.322
Too small.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.721
Russians in Brooklyn?

21:16.920 --> 21:18.888
Russians working with Latinos?
I doubt it.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.290
Hey, Nancy Drew,
you're quiet over there.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.847
Take a look at this.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.251
RSK in Queens?

21:29.400 --> 21:31.004
The guy running the crew's
named Rolla.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.527
He's got one serious rap sheet.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.967
RSK has doubled in scope
and influence

21:36.120 --> 21:37.565
over the last six months.

21:37.720 --> 21:41.361
- What can do that?
- Influx of cash, new product, both.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.244
Lobos.
Suddenly, the RSKs are controlling

21:45.400 --> 21:47.129
a huge amount of territory.

21:47.320 --> 21:49.687
Whoever Ghost is,
Rolla could be our connect.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.684
- It makes perfect sense.
- If Rolla is in the Ghost network,

21:52.840 --> 21:54.365
he's either Ghost's next target

21:54.520 --> 21:55.885
or at least knows who he is.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.411
Either way,
we need to talk to him.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.648
We might just save his life.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.527
I know who's been going after us.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.445
Rolla.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.883
That's what Drift told you.
Okay, all right.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.042
Get the fuck out of here
with that bullshit.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.089
You're fucking with me, right?

22:19.240 --> 22:20.526
Cousins of Drift's in Miami
were iced

22:20.680 --> 22:22.967
by a Latin girl hitter
a few years back.

22:23.120 --> 22:26.647
The crew that hired her
was a Miami set of RSKs.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.244
Pretty straight line
to Rolla from there.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.243
That's not proof, Tommy.

22:36.400 --> 22:37.731
Ruiz thinks it is.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.405
He's threatened to go to war
with the RSKs

22:39.560 --> 22:42.723
- unless we fix this.
- First of all, fuck Ruiz.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.809
I ain't never taken orders
from his snake ass,

22:44.960 --> 22:46.530
and I ain't gonna start now.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.569
And secondly,
why would Rolla do it?

22:48.760 --> 22:50.683
We've known him for years.
Come on, man.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.604
Same reason
two former corner boys

22:52.760 --> 22:55.161
looked Breeze in the face
and shot him in the fucking head.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.000
When you want that top spot,

23:01.160 --> 23:03.606
you're willing to do
whatever it takes to get it.

23:04.840 --> 23:06.365
Everything we've been through,

23:06.520 --> 23:08.602
this is the only thing
that makes sense now.

23:08.760 --> 23:11.923
I'm telling you, it's Rolla.

23:12.080 --> 23:15.607
We're supposed to be partners
in this shit, 50-50.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.449
You trust me, right?

23:23.760 --> 23:27.401
You and me were sure it was Anibal,

23:27.560 --> 23:29.289
and then you and me
were sure it was Ruiz.

23:29.440 --> 23:32.922
See, Tommy, the problem is,
we can't be wrong again.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.321
I'm not wrong.

23:38.440 --> 23:41.523
This is the priority now.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.490
Not this fucking club

23:44.640 --> 23:47.325
or any other bullshit
that's been a distraction

23:47.480 --> 23:48.925
from what we're doing.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.084
This is gonna happen,

23:52.280 --> 23:53.850
one way or another.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.323
One way or another.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.165
If you don't want a war...

24:04.960 --> 24:06.849
there's only one way to stop it.

24:14.960 --> 24:18.681
I'm not pulling that trigger
without proof, Tommy,

24:18.840 --> 24:20.922
no fucking way.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.811
You don't believe me.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.930
Fine. Get all the fucking proof
you need, if you can,

24:27.080 --> 24:28.684
by tomorrow.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.364
Kill Rolla...

24:39.560 --> 24:40.925
or I will.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.411
Can't sleep, baby?

25:24.560 --> 25:26.289
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.

25:30.520 --> 25:31.806
Something on your mind?

25:34.480 --> 25:36.369
Always.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.441
You want to talk about it?

25:41.640 --> 25:43.927
I got a big decision to make,
Tasha.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.770
What does Tommy think?

25:52.040 --> 25:55.089
You know Tommy.
He doesn't think.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.923
He wants me to trust him,
you know?

26:00.120 --> 26:03.329
You got to trust the people
who've always been loyal to you.

26:06.840 --> 26:09.764
Tommy's always been loyal.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.928
Always has been, up until now.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.204
Is there anyone whose
judgment you trust as much?

26:25.960 --> 26:29.407
Anyone who's been on
your side all this time?

27:00.920 --> 27:04.811
Big J,
I need to send a package upstate.

27:20.600 --> 27:23.968
Hey, yo, man, lights out
is gonna be at 9:00 tonight.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.685
Whatever, man.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.604
I turn them off when I turn them off.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.045
What's up, K?

27:45.200 --> 27:48.727
Must be real shit
if you're reaching out this way.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.291
Shit, I ain't get no
message like this since--

27:50.480 --> 27:51.925
The Trenton beef.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.286
Well,
you guided me right then, man,

27:53.480 --> 27:55.528
- and I need your ear now.
- So what you need?

27:55.680 --> 27:57.808
Well, look, man,
I don't know if you heard.

27:57.960 --> 28:00.691
Someone's been hitting our crew,
dropping motherfuckers left and right.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.446
Now, I heard RSK might be involved.
Hard to believe, though, you know?

28:03.600 --> 28:06.080
Rolla a loyal motherfucker, man.
You made him what he is.

28:06.240 --> 28:09.687
- He wouldn't move against us.
- Yeah, that's what I think.

28:09.840 --> 28:12.081
But, you know, I trusted people
before and been burned.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.765
- I hear that.
- Well, word's out.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.770
I got to move on this shit today
or I got a war on my hands, bro.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.122
Say no more.
Keep the phone close, all right?

28:19.280 --> 28:21.931
All right.
One.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.490
James St. Patrick here.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.160
Mr. St. Patrick,
this is Simon Stern.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.765
Oh, hello.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.844
How does tonight
work for you, 6:00 P.M.?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.411
6:00 P.M. tonight is great.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.927
Good, I'll have my assistant
send you the address.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.686
I look forward to seeing you
and your wife in a few hours.

28:42.840 --> 28:46.447
Oh, and leave that sycophantic
boy wonder, Kantos,

28:46.600 --> 28:49.285
at home, will you?
Tonight is adults only.

28:49.440 --> 28:51.044
Absolutely.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.164
You look like you just saw a ghost.

28:55.320 --> 28:56.970
That was Simon Stern.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.043
- Dinner's tonight.
- What did I tell you?

28:59.200 --> 29:01.521
He wants to partner.
What time should we be there?

29:01.680 --> 29:04.809
Not you, just me and my wife
at 6:00 P.M.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.440
Oh, shit, at 6:00.
I got to go make a call, now.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.449
Well, have a good time.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.610
I guess.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.251
Dos.

29:50.440 --> 29:51.965
Thank you for doing this.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.963
I want you to like him.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.849
He makes me happy.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.844
I know.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.004
You cooking, it says a lot.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.205
Angie, how you doing?

30:11.360 --> 30:13.362
I'm covered in flour.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.807
- What's up?
- Stern called.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.049
See?
You were all worried for nothing.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.726
You're right, always are.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.571
He invited me to dinner
at their house.

30:24.760 --> 30:26.842
It's tonight, Angie.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.889
I know, I'm sorry.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.565
Look, I'll make it up to you.

30:30.760 --> 30:33.331
I need to swing by
the house on my way back,

30:33.480 --> 30:36.927
um, but I can come by after,
you know?

30:37.080 --> 30:39.321
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.290
Focus on Stern tonight.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.050
Yeah?

30:45.640 --> 30:48.041
Yeah. Go kill it.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.891
All right, thanks.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.571
So it was a meeting?
That's why he cancelled?

31:06.760 --> 31:08.250
A business meeting, yeah.

31:10.440 --> 31:12.681
Pretty last-minute
for a business thing, don't you think?

31:12.840 --> 31:14.251
Don't, okay?

31:14.400 --> 31:16.402
I'm just saying, doesn't it sound
a little sketchy to you?

31:16.600 --> 31:20.446
I know what business happens
last-minute at night,

31:20.600 --> 31:22.602
and it ain't the kind
in boardrooms.

31:22.760 --> 31:26.082
If he wants to make you happy,
he has to get off the streets.

31:26.280 --> 31:28.647
I know you said that
he's different now, Angela.

31:34.840 --> 31:37.161
He's married.

31:40.080 --> 31:43.050
He's a businessman, legit,
aboveboard, real.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.009
I told you, he's changed
since we were kids.

31:45.160 --> 31:48.050
He's just...

31:48.200 --> 31:50.282
- married.
- The hotel keys.

31:50.440 --> 31:51.851
Now I get it.

31:53.320 --> 31:54.970
And you're supposed to be
the smart one.

32:03.960 --> 32:07.203
I know. I can tell.

32:07.400 --> 32:10.961
But it's not enough.
It never is.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.805
This isn't gonna be
a happily ever after.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.083
You look great.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.446
Well, I had hope you'd like it,

32:36.640 --> 32:39.120
since you picked out
everything for me to wear.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.520
It's an important night, Tasha.

32:40.680 --> 32:42.523
We got to be on our A-game,
all right?

32:42.680 --> 32:44.887
We got to handle tonight
so we earn a tomorrow.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.202
So go easy on the drinking.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.686
I don't need these people
seeing you tipsy.

32:48.840 --> 32:51.207
And if the wife wants to get chatty,
just play along with it.

32:51.400 --> 32:54.483
I won't embarrass you.
Okay, Ghost?

32:55.680 --> 32:57.728
Ah, I take it this is the lovely

32:57.880 --> 32:59.723
Mrs. St. Patrick.

32:59.880 --> 33:02.724
James didn't mention your beauty.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.804
- This is my wife, Madeline.
- Oh, hello.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.207
- Your home is beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

33:08.360 --> 33:11.045
The place in Boca feels more like home,
but here we are.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.770
- Mrs. Stern, pleasure.
- Likewise.

33:12.920 --> 33:15.400
Darling, why don't you take
Mrs. St. Patrick on the tour?

33:15.560 --> 33:17.642
James and I have
some business to talk about.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.609
Trust me,
you do not want to be here

33:19.760 --> 33:22.730
when they talk about business.
You will fall asleep.

33:25.640 --> 33:28.723
- My wife is beautiful, isn't she?
- Um, yes, sir.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.451
It's expected, you know?
We have to play the part.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.728
They have to look the part.

33:33.880 --> 33:36.121
It all gets
so goddamn boring after a while.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.371
Ah, Perrier-Jouët, 1825.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.931
Oh, no, thank you.

33:42.120 --> 33:45.806
A club owner who doesn't drink.
How curious.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.241
You are full of surprises,
Mr. St. Patrick.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.730
I've invited another couple
to join us,

33:52.920 --> 33:54.649
one of my lieutenants and his wife.

33:54.840 --> 33:56.683
- Todd and, uh--
- Sandra.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.763
Sandra.
This is James St. Patrick.

33:58.920 --> 34:00.524
- Todd, Sandra.
- Pleasure.

34:00.720 --> 34:01.926
The pleasure's mine.

34:02.080 --> 34:06.130
This is the young upstart
who stole our Cynthia Sheridan parties.

34:06.280 --> 34:07.930
That is me.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.445
It certainly is.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.442
Dinner.
How about food? Let's eat.

34:44.639 --> 34:46.768
I need you
to meet me in 30 minutes.

34:47.920 --> 34:51.481
So then he asked,
"Do yachts like to sink?"

34:51.639 --> 34:54.324
Oh, God, it's so much
better once they leave.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.322
God knows
they don't want to talk to us

34:56.480 --> 34:58.130
and we do not want
to talk to them.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.126
Sweetie, those are so pretty.
Are they new?

35:02.280 --> 35:05.762
Oh, $15,000.
Didn't bat an eye.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.729
You should've got him
for at least 30.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.644
Price they pay for the time away.

35:09.800 --> 35:13.168
Should've been 50
for that new club location

35:13.320 --> 35:15.163
he's been investigating
on the side.

35:15.320 --> 35:17.846
It's so funny how
they think you don't know.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.241
Oh, no, they know you know.
They just don't care.

35:20.400 --> 35:23.210
- Mm.
- That's the spirit.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.850
The only way
to get through these things

35:25.000 --> 35:27.082
is to stay drunk.
Cheers.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.729
Can I ask you something?

35:30.880 --> 35:32.609
Can I touch your hair?

35:32.760 --> 35:34.410
I just think it's fascinating.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.164
Excuse me for a second.

35:50.160 --> 35:52.049
- So pretty.
- So cute.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.043
Darling.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.725
Back when I was still
in the clubs day to day,

35:55.920 --> 35:59.925
the ideal mix was models,
actors...

36:00.080 --> 36:01.764
the musicians, of course,

36:01.920 --> 36:03.888
politicians hoping not
to get caught,

36:04.040 --> 36:06.725
gays, drag queens,

36:06.880 --> 36:10.123
those smooth,
hairless young men.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.123
Anything went.

36:12.280 --> 36:15.284
A buffet of pleasures, really.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.960
That was before AIDS
came in and ruined everything.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.009
I digress.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.242
My point is,
times have changed.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.370
A truly successful mix
now involves

36:25.520 --> 36:30.128
a certain element
that I admit I am less familiar with.

36:30.280 --> 36:32.203
African-Americans and Latinos

36:32.360 --> 36:34.044
have begun to have
real purchasing power.

36:34.200 --> 36:37.488
They're dictating the marketplace,
not just influencing it.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.050
How do you
get the blacks and the Latins

36:41.200 --> 36:45.569
to show up
night after night and behave?

36:46.800 --> 36:49.201
Mixing with the club kids,
the socialites.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.409
And on top of that,
take my Cynthia Sheridan business.

36:52.600 --> 36:56.047
Guys with your background
usually open clubs uptown

36:56.200 --> 36:58.168
or in Brooklyn

36:58.360 --> 37:02.729
and open and close
within a week, but not you.

37:05.280 --> 37:09.126
What's your secret?
No details, just your philosophy.

37:10.120 --> 37:13.329
There is no secret,
just me.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.440
- I don't follow.
- Well, I'm a black man from the hood.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.206
Most of the guys I came up with
are either dead or in jail.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.566
I live in
the penthouse of my building

37:21.760 --> 37:24.923
above the lawyers and doctors
trying to get into my club.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.362
See, people take you
at face value, Simon.

37:28.520 --> 37:30.045
Me, well, I have to transform

37:30.200 --> 37:32.965
to meet
everyone's expectations constantly.

37:33.960 --> 37:37.567
Truth isn't one thing,
because I'm not one thing.

37:37.720 --> 37:40.326
You understand?
I take all my experiences and use them

37:40.480 --> 37:42.130
to cater to all different kinds
of people

37:42.320 --> 37:45.324
under one roof.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.050
Whether it's the black
professional athlete

37:47.240 --> 37:48.730
ordering his next bottle of Cîroc,

37:48.880 --> 37:50.370
or whether it's the Wall Street
motherfucker

37:50.520 --> 37:52.648
getting blackout drunk
on the company's dime,

37:52.800 --> 37:54.723
I understand him.
I get him.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.804
And because I get him...

37:58.000 --> 38:00.571
I get him.
And because I get him...

38:00.720 --> 38:03.166
I get rich.

38:05.080 --> 38:08.004
- Okay, I want to hear details.
- I want your offer.

38:16.400 --> 38:21.406
$6 million.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.801
- To open the next club?
- No, to own it outright,

38:23.960 --> 38:25.325
to add it to my brand.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.647
Truth is not for sale, Simon.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.280
James, once you get started,
you won't even have time for Truth.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.727
You're gonna be
seeing so much of this world

38:36.880 --> 38:38.211
working for me.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.044
You're gonna
forget all about that club.

38:42.360 --> 38:43.930
Working for you?

38:44.080 --> 38:46.367
As one of my executives
in training.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.363
I'll bring you into management.

38:48.520 --> 38:51.729
Maybe you'll replace
Todd here as my right hand.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.882
- Maybe.
- I told you,

38:54.040 --> 38:57.249
I'm "the secret"
to Truth's success.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.404
I don't need training
to be myself.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.244
I came here
to discuss a partnership.

39:03.800 --> 39:06.041
Partnership with you?

39:07.880 --> 39:09.564
No.

39:12.040 --> 39:15.601
You may be talented,
but you're not ready.

39:15.760 --> 39:19.401
But since you are so unique,

39:19.560 --> 39:21.403
you come on,

39:21.560 --> 39:24.245
I'll let you report directly to me.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.971
My husband
doesn't report to anyone.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.440
Oh.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.364
Is that how you feel, James?

39:37.200 --> 39:39.009
Simon,
I didn't get where I am by following.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.924
I lead.

39:41.080 --> 39:43.447
I urge you
to reconsider partnership,

39:43.600 --> 39:45.807
because if I walk out of that door,

39:45.960 --> 39:48.611
I turn from potential ally
back to competitor,

39:48.760 --> 39:51.491
and I don't think you want that.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.449
I don't think you want that,
either.

39:54.680 --> 39:57.286
I'll take my chances.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.886
Thank you for your hospitality.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.366
May the best man win.

40:01.520 --> 40:03.170
I will.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.040
Todd.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.487
Mrs. St. Patrick,
you're a feisty one.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.961
- I like that.
- Mm-hmm.

40:15.120 --> 40:17.566
Don't worry, baby.
You did the right thing.

40:17.720 --> 40:19.324
It wasn't your call
to speak for me, Tasha.

40:19.520 --> 40:22.967
- It's my decision to make.
- There was no decision.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.851
You're nobody's fucking
number two, are you?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.890
I mean, I don't even know why the hell
we went up there in the first place.

40:29.040 --> 40:31.168
You know that white man wasn't
gonna see you as no partner.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.488
The fuck you want from me, huh, Tasha?
What you want me to do?

40:33.640 --> 40:34.801
You want me to stay the same
and never change?

40:34.960 --> 40:36.724
It ever occur to you I ain't
the same street nigger

40:36.880 --> 40:39.360
you married anymore?

40:40.880 --> 40:42.405
Who's that?

40:44.000 --> 40:47.163
Kanan.

40:47.320 --> 40:50.210
Seems like
the same old Ghost to me.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.566
What's up, man?

40:51.760 --> 40:53.603
You ain't gonna like
what I got to say, G.

40:53.800 --> 40:55.450
You was right about Rolla.

40:55.640 --> 40:58.007
Little nigger put up 100 thou
for anybody who could help link him

40:58.160 --> 41:00.845
with an out-of-town hitter.
Said he wanted top of the line,

41:01.000 --> 41:03.765
no mistakes, to take down
your whole network.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.490
$100,000.

41:08.160 --> 41:11.004
- Yeah, that's what they're saying.
- Damn.

41:11.160 --> 41:13.401
Some of my niggers in here
got connections down in Miami.

41:13.560 --> 41:16.166
They said Rolla took a trip
down there about a month ago,

41:16.320 --> 41:18.971
met up with his brothers down there.
They introduced him to a Latin girl,

41:19.160 --> 41:21.845
hot piece of ass they said
knows her way around a knife.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.566
Bitch wear these crazy-ass
pink sneakers everywhere she goes,

41:24.720 --> 41:26.290
don't even take them off to fuck, man.

41:26.440 --> 41:28.249
That's the chick
we've been looking for, man.

41:28.400 --> 41:31.051
Rolla know he in trouble,

41:31.200 --> 41:34.010
so he already moving around
a little different.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.527
He's hiding out on Long Island,
some bitch's place.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.927
I know exactly where it is.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.048
Look, K, good looking out, man.
Keep your head up, all right?

41:41.200 --> 41:43.043
All right.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.521
I'm sorry it turned out like this, G.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.286
One.

41:50.480 --> 41:51.686
Shawn,
I need you to take Tasha home.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.888
I got to make a stop.

41:59.040 --> 42:01.247
I said 30 minutes, Nomar.

42:01.400 --> 42:04.722
Couldn't wait, huh?

42:04.880 --> 42:07.247
I'm beginning to think
you get lonely without me.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.731
Who's this?

42:19.280 --> 42:22.921
Rolla,
boss of the Rock Street Assholes.

42:24.080 --> 42:25.525
Is he involved with Lobos?

42:25.680 --> 42:27.330
There's no way
he's got a blanquito in his crew

42:27.520 --> 42:29.170
might go by Ghost?

42:29.320 --> 42:31.084
No.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.641
No white guys in the RSKs.

42:33.800 --> 42:36.770
As for Lobos, I know Rolla
has history with Ruiz.

42:37.920 --> 42:41.367
Long-standing shit,
but we're under strict instructions

42:41.520 --> 42:43.170
not to mess with the RSKs
if we see them on the streets.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.288
Like a professional courtesy?

42:45.440 --> 42:47.442
Don't antagonize the other
dealers in the network?

42:47.600 --> 42:50.126
I can't see another reason
why Ruiz would keep us

42:50.280 --> 42:54.126
from stomping
these motherfuckers out.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.123
Where can I find this guy?

42:56.280 --> 42:58.601
We went to his last known,
and he wasn't there.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.403
I can find out where he is.

43:02.600 --> 43:05.080
He's got Poncho keeping tabs
on everybody he's pissed at,

43:05.240 --> 43:08.130
just in case. I'll call him.

43:08.280 --> 43:09.645
Don't ask too much.

43:13.360 --> 43:15.283
I won't.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.124
Gracias, Nomar.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.364
Make the call.

43:57.360 --> 43:59.681
- Try calling my cell.
- What?

43:59.840 --> 44:01.729
Call my cell.

44:14.800 --> 44:17.406
You're scaring me, Tommy.
What's going on?

44:17.560 --> 44:20.450
You can tell me.

44:22.720 --> 44:27.009
James was supposed to...

44:27.160 --> 44:29.606
do...

44:29.760 --> 44:32.604
something for me...

44:32.760 --> 44:34.524
tonight.

44:36.520 --> 44:38.329
Son of a bitch better do it tonight.

44:46.560 --> 44:50.565
- Do you think he's gonna do it?
- No.

44:50.720 --> 44:54.042
We used to do everything together,

44:54.200 --> 44:56.441
side by side.

44:59.240 --> 45:00.685
Something's changed.

45:00.880 --> 45:02.769
He ain't the same.

45:05.920 --> 45:08.127
You ever think

45:08.280 --> 45:10.169
you don't need him anymore?

45:10.320 --> 45:12.891
I mean, if you don't trust him
to do this thing tonight--

45:13.040 --> 45:15.964
If I can't trust him?

45:19.560 --> 45:21.210
Then I don't know.

45:23.080 --> 45:25.924
I don't fucking know.

45:26.080 --> 45:28.845
If you can't trust him, baby,

45:29.000 --> 45:30.411
you can trust me.

45:34.120 --> 45:35.770
Come here.

46:06.400 --> 46:08.402
As soon as you get back
with my food,

46:08.560 --> 46:10.722
I'll put this long nine on you.

46:10.880 --> 46:13.042
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

46:13.200 --> 46:15.521
Better hurry up with my food, yo.

46:45.600 --> 46:46.886
I'd offer you a drink,

46:47.040 --> 46:49.407
but we both know you won't take it.

46:54.120 --> 46:55.770
They say we're gonna get
ten inches tonight.

46:57.720 --> 46:59.449
That what they say, huh?

47:04.160 --> 47:06.242
Well, then we should probably
get to it, then.

47:11.840 --> 47:16.129
- You don't want to know why?
- We here now.

47:16.280 --> 47:18.567
Knowing why
ain't gonna make no never mind.

47:23.200 --> 47:26.602
I know it's been you hitting
us from the inside, Rolla,

47:26.760 --> 47:29.331
smiling in my face
the whole fucking time, man.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.528
You actually said that shit
like you truly believe it.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.842
- I do.
- No, you don't.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.925
'Cause if you did, my black ass
wouldn't even got a chance to sit down.

47:38.120 --> 47:39.565
I'm offering you
a chance to come clean.

47:39.720 --> 47:40.960
No, that ain't it.

47:41.120 --> 47:43.282
You're offering me
a chance to convince you.

47:44.960 --> 47:49.522
Okay, I'll play along.
So you're saying I hit your shipment,

47:49.720 --> 47:51.802
I killed fat-ass Anibal,

47:51.960 --> 47:54.327
I stabbed Ruiz,

47:54.480 --> 47:56.482
- and what else I do?
- A few weeks ago,

47:56.680 --> 47:58.444
you had a courier
of mine jumped, a woman.

48:01.520 --> 48:04.729
God damn.
I've been a busy motherfucker.

48:04.880 --> 48:08.885
And we know about the hitter
you hired, a female, Latina.

48:10.240 --> 48:12.208
A bitch?

48:12.360 --> 48:14.442
Me?

48:14.600 --> 48:18.321
- That's a tall tale, G.
- Don't fuck with me, boy.

48:20.240 --> 48:23.084
Ruiz is down to go to war,
Tommy is convinced,

48:23.240 --> 48:25.322
don't fuck with me.

48:25.480 --> 48:28.051
Heard you went through your brothers
in Miami to hire the chick.

48:28.200 --> 48:31.204
Yeah, I went to Miami, sure,

48:31.360 --> 48:34.091
and got a goddamn tan.

48:34.240 --> 48:36.607
I didn't get no hitter in a skirt.

48:41.400 --> 48:44.688
Look me in the eyes
like a man.

48:48.560 --> 48:50.369
Tell me you did it.
Just own the shit.

48:52.520 --> 48:55.603
I can't do it, Captain.

48:55.760 --> 48:58.240
I get Ruiz.
Yeah, his bitch ass go bye-bye,

48:58.400 --> 48:59.890
I'm gonna be on them corners,
no doubt.

49:01.160 --> 49:04.528
And Eminem, well, shit,
we both know he ain't never liked me.

49:05.920 --> 49:07.604
But neither of them bring
you to shooting a boy

49:07.760 --> 49:10.081
you raised from the streets,
do they?

49:13.360 --> 49:14.691
It's Kanan, right?

49:14.840 --> 49:16.330
You and that crazy motherfucker

49:16.480 --> 49:18.244
still tight after all these years.

49:18.400 --> 49:21.449
Shit, you trust him more
than anybody, even Tommy.

49:21.640 --> 49:24.883
The question is, G, what the fuck do he
gain from pointing you in my direction?

49:25.040 --> 49:27.441
He don't gain
a motherfucking anything.

49:31.440 --> 49:32.771
He's my friend.

49:35.960 --> 49:38.042
I'm your friend.

49:40.960 --> 49:42.724
I am your friend.

49:57.360 --> 49:59.966
Said we're supposed to get
ten inches tonight, huh?

50:47.360 --> 50:49.283
- Still pretty warm.
- Carajo.

50:49.480 --> 50:50.970
Yeah.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.765
I'll call NYPD.

50:57.920 --> 50:59.843
Maybe the killer's still in the area.

53:23.520 --> 53:25.443
Thanks, girl.

53:26.680 --> 53:28.967
So he wasn't
Prince Charming after all.

53:29.120 --> 53:32.249
Unless princey
was a two-timing nigger.

53:32.400 --> 53:34.084
Have you
confronted his worthless ass?

53:34.240 --> 53:36.288
- Keisha, you don't--
- He's the one who married you,

53:36.480 --> 53:39.324
put your name
on every bill, on every paper.

53:39.480 --> 53:41.960
You have his kids,
this fancy penthouse,

53:42.120 --> 53:45.124
his bank accounts.
Take it all, T.

53:45.320 --> 53:47.641
Divorce his ass
and take every last bit of it.

53:48.640 --> 53:49.801
She ain't white, is she?

53:49.960 --> 53:52.566
'Cause I could see a brother
like Ghost going that way.

53:52.720 --> 53:54.768
No, she ain't white.

53:54.960 --> 53:56.644
Ain't black, either.

53:58.720 --> 54:01.121
Nothing like me at all.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.282
Sorry you're going through this, T.

54:03.440 --> 54:05.568
But you got to take care of yourself.

54:05.760 --> 54:08.161
Ghost took back his loyalty,

54:08.320 --> 54:10.322
so now it's time
for you to do the same.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.682
All hail
the goddamn conquering hero.

54:23.840 --> 54:25.524
The redhead lives here now?

54:25.680 --> 54:28.604
Don't worry about her.
She's out cold.

54:29.760 --> 54:35.005
So can we scratch our friend
off the Christmas list?

54:43.680 --> 54:46.411
You did
what needed to be done, G.

54:51.360 --> 54:53.840
I'm going home, man.

54:57.640 --> 55:00.211
It's a good day's work, brother.

55:00.400 --> 55:02.562
Yeah.

55:20.080 --> 55:22.970
- How long have you been here?
- I was supposed to go home.

55:23.120 --> 55:25.851
The truth is, my place doesn't
feel much like home anymore.

55:28.920 --> 55:31.207
I'm sorry I stood you up.

55:32.920 --> 55:34.763
How was Stern's?

55:34.920 --> 55:37.366
I should've taken you.

55:37.560 --> 55:40.609
Don't say that.

55:40.760 --> 55:42.603
We're not dating.

55:42.760 --> 55:44.444
We're not a couple.

55:44.600 --> 55:47.444
We're just

55:47.600 --> 55:49.921
two stupid kids playing house,

55:50.080 --> 55:52.606
trying to wrap our hands
around a fantasy.

55:53.720 --> 55:56.769
- I missed one night, Angie.
- You miss every night.

56:02.280 --> 56:03.964
I need you to hear me.

56:07.480 --> 56:09.642
I want to change my life for you.

56:09.840 --> 56:12.491
I don't want to break up your marriage.

56:13.520 --> 56:16.649
That's not the person
I ever thought I would be.

56:16.800 --> 56:20.282
So this is on you now, Jamie.

56:20.480 --> 56:24.690
If you are telling me that this,
us, is gonna happen,

56:24.840 --> 56:26.330
then it has to happen,

56:26.480 --> 56:28.482
because I don't know
what I'm gonna do

56:28.640 --> 56:30.244
if you don't come through.

56:34.160 --> 56:36.640
I'll make it happen.

56:40.400 --> 56:41.765
Just say you love me.

56:41.960 --> 56:43.371
Jamie.

56:43.520 --> 56:45.090
Say it.

56:50.240 --> 56:54.165
I love you, okay?

57:16.280 --> 57:18.362
Rolla's dead.

57:20.680 --> 57:23.570
Ghost, you dumb motherfucker.
Anybody know he did it?

57:23.720 --> 57:25.085
Not yet.

57:27.040 --> 57:28.883
Well, we know two things.

57:29.040 --> 57:30.929
One, Ghost trusts me,

57:31.080 --> 57:33.367
and two, he's all alone now,

57:33.520 --> 57:35.363
just got Tommy.

57:35.520 --> 57:37.522
And that boy way too dumb
to see what's coming.

57:37.720 --> 57:40.564
It's so much better
that you fucked up and Ruiz lived.

57:40.720 --> 57:42.210
He gonna come
looking for protection

57:42.360 --> 57:44.727
- when I come calling.
- You owe me money.

57:44.880 --> 57:47.406
- 100K.
- And you owe me bodies,

57:47.560 --> 57:49.722
but I'm gonna give you
another chance to get it done.

57:49.880 --> 57:52.008
I'll pay full freight.

57:52.160 --> 57:54.288
Oh, and, honey, you're gonna
need to get you some new shoes.

57:56.280 --> 57:57.611
Look.

57:59.720 --> 58:01.722
You make sure my son ain't there
when you do it, neither, right?

58:01.880 --> 58:04.008
Right.

58:04.160 --> 58:06.083
- When?
- I'll give you the signal.

58:06.240 --> 58:07.969
I want Ghost dead before I get out.

58:08.120 --> 58:09.451
Mm.
