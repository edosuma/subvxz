00:50.120 --> 00:51.372
Dammit!

00:57.378 --> 00:58.629
Keep moving.

01:53.601 --> 01:55.311
Oh god!

03:07.508 --> 03:08.509
Now what?

03:09.385 --> 03:11.846
Ah, what about those
travel games we brought?

03:12.012 --> 03:13.764
- Why don't you pull those out?
- Hmm.

03:15.766 --> 03:16.767
Um...

03:18.185 --> 03:19.228
Um...

03:20.020 --> 03:21.855
I don't think these were
designed for the driver

03:21.856 --> 03:23.064
to be playing too?

03:23.065 --> 03:24.942
What! Come on.

03:25.860 --> 03:26.861
Ugh.

03:27.486 --> 03:29.631
I suspect these were
meant to distract kids,

03:29.655 --> 03:30.739
on long drives.

03:32.241 --> 03:34.577
What kind of games do you
have for distracting drivers?

03:34.785 --> 03:36.912
I'm not sure drivers
should be distracted.

03:39.456 --> 03:41.184
We should have brought
those trivia games.

03:41.208 --> 03:42.877
You could ask me questions
while we drove.

03:43.127 --> 03:44.879
- Crossword puzzle?
- You have one?

03:47.506 --> 03:50.175
- Awesome, let's do it.
- Alright.

05:59.305 --> 06:01.074
Can you take a look to see
what we have to do next?

06:01.098 --> 06:02.099
Oh!

06:05.811 --> 06:09.064
We on this stretch of road, for
at least another two hours.

06:10.482 --> 06:12.162
- I'm gonna need a break soon.
- That's OK.

06:12.401 --> 06:13.837
You can break whenever you like.

06:13.861 --> 06:15.541
- That's the plan remember.
- Yeah... yeah.

06:17.364 --> 06:18.657
Sorry I don't drive.

06:20.117 --> 06:22.578
Why don't you drive?
Everybody drives.

06:22.953 --> 06:26.081
People don't believe me, it's
sounds weird but it's true.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.752
When I was a kid, my friends
and I were interested in cars.

06:30.628 --> 06:32.814
There was an old
drive-in movie theater,

06:32.838 --> 06:34.465
about a mile from my house,

06:34.590 --> 06:36.693
and we used to dream
about being old enough

06:36.717 --> 06:37.986
to get our driving licenses

06:38.010 --> 06:40.054
so that we could go there
without our parents.

06:41.555 --> 06:43.182
But the drive-in closed and...

06:43.974 --> 06:45.976
we all started doing
other things.

06:46.477 --> 06:48.270
Driving just never
came up again.

06:48.687 --> 06:49.789
Next thing you know,
I'm in my 20's,

06:49.813 --> 06:51.398
and I don't have a license.

06:52.441 --> 06:53.692
It's not too late?

06:54.193 --> 06:55.587
I didn't say I was never
going to get my license.

06:55.611 --> 06:56.755
I Just don't have it now,

06:56.779 --> 06:58.059
when it would be
very convenient.

06:59.615 --> 07:00.616
Sorry.

07:01.242 --> 07:02.302
I know it must be tiring

07:02.326 --> 07:03.911
being the only driver
on a long trip.

07:06.205 --> 07:07.289
It's exhausting!

07:07.873 --> 07:09.226
But...

07:09.250 --> 07:11.627
we are saving a
bundle on travel, so!

07:12.586 --> 07:13.688
Well say the word,

07:13.712 --> 07:16.112
and I'll start looking for a
place to camp out for the night.

07:17.049 --> 07:18.884
- Start looking.
- OK.

07:23.222 --> 07:24.542
Thanks for doing
this, by the way.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.641
What!

07:26.016 --> 07:28.519
Don't even sweat it.
I love an adventure.

07:28.894 --> 07:30.436
The bridesmaid dress
my sister had me buy,

07:30.437 --> 07:32.022
was crazy expensive.

07:32.815 --> 07:34.615
Flying to her wedding
would have wiped me out.

07:34.942 --> 07:35.943
Well, ah...

07:36.527 --> 07:39.029
Thank you... for making
me your plus one.

07:41.240 --> 07:42.324
You too good to me Mike.

07:44.910 --> 07:45.911
Nah.

07:50.749 --> 07:53.854
There's a ranger's station
about twenty minutes away.

07:53.878 --> 07:55.939
We can ask there about
camping options?

07:55.963 --> 07:58.257
You direct us and I
shall get us there.

08:33.792 --> 08:36.003
Where the heck are we?

08:36.169 --> 08:37.355
Better I don't tell you,

08:37.379 --> 08:38.756
so you don't get
too discouraged.

08:40.216 --> 08:42.068
We still have about two
thirds of the trip to go.

08:44.178 --> 08:45.846
You know what... it's all good.

08:46.639 --> 08:48.366
I'm having a great time.

08:48.390 --> 08:49.391
So...

08:49.850 --> 08:50.890
nice hanging out with you.

08:51.268 --> 08:53.580
Well I hope you feel that
when the whole trip is done?

08:53.604 --> 08:54.706
Well...

08:54.730 --> 08:56.650
Just don't eat anything
that makes you too gassy!

09:00.402 --> 09:01.779
- Let's go in.
- OK.

09:09.912 --> 09:13.207
- I hope they have a washroom?
- They have to have a washroom!

09:13.499 --> 09:15.019
I'm sure it's requirement
or something.

09:15.251 --> 09:16.502
I don't see anyone?

09:17.253 --> 09:19.296
Hope this isn't one of
those unmanned rest stops?

09:19.839 --> 09:21.674
Massive ranger station, so...

09:22.424 --> 09:24.927
worst comes to worst, we could
look in a brochure or something.

09:25.052 --> 09:27.847
But ranger station implies
there is a ranger!

09:28.222 --> 09:29.282
There is!

09:29.306 --> 09:30.909
Oh my God!

09:30.933 --> 09:32.253
Sorry I did not
mean to spook you.

09:32.726 --> 09:34.728
That's OK.

09:34.854 --> 09:36.974
I don't get a lot of people
coming through here and...

09:37.189 --> 09:38.190
I was taking a nap.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.918
We sorry to wake you.

09:39.942 --> 09:41.419
You don't have to
apologize for me,

09:41.443 --> 09:42.504
not being at my post.

09:42.528 --> 09:44.947
I normally have a bell
above the door that...

09:46.073 --> 09:47.283
Well, never mind.

09:47.700 --> 09:48.820
What can I do for you folks?

09:48.909 --> 09:51.721
We've been driving a
really long time.

09:51.745 --> 09:53.785
We were just thinking about
finding a place to camp?

09:54.206 --> 09:56.709
Well, if you think you can
drive for another hour,

09:57.084 --> 09:58.961
there's a bunch of motels
up by the highway.

10:00.629 --> 10:02.858
We'd rather not. I've
been driving a long time.

10:02.882 --> 10:03.984
I'm the only one who drives

10:04.008 --> 10:06.010
and my eyes are really
tired from the road.

10:06.760 --> 10:07.761
You don't drive?

10:08.053 --> 10:09.263
It's a long story.

10:09.471 --> 10:11.974
Plus we are trying
to save on hotel costs.

10:12.099 --> 10:14.139
We traveling across the
country to get to a wedding.

10:14.185 --> 10:15.186
Yeah, sure.

10:15.603 --> 10:17.855
Well... we do have
camping permits.

10:18.022 --> 10:19.523
How long were you
thinking of staying?

10:19.857 --> 10:20.858
Just overnight.

10:22.026 --> 10:23.027
I got to warn you though,

10:23.152 --> 10:24.792
we don't get a lot of
people through here.

10:25.112 --> 10:27.007
So it's not as well maintained
as some of the more

10:27.031 --> 10:28.925
touristy spots that you
might find on your trip.

10:28.949 --> 10:30.993
That's totally fine, we
just need a place to crash.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.453
OK, that we can do for you.

10:33.204 --> 10:35.223
What you want to do, is
go back to the road.

10:35.247 --> 10:36.832
On the other side,
you'll see an arrow.

10:37.208 --> 10:39.001
Follow that until
you come to a fork,

10:39.293 --> 10:41.462
take the left side. You'll
see a place to park.

10:41.837 --> 10:43.773
And after that, the whole
forest is your campground.

10:43.797 --> 10:44.983
Huh.

10:45.007 --> 10:46.526
When you say you don't
get a lot of people

10:46.550 --> 10:47.551
around here...

10:47.927 --> 10:48.987
You're it!

10:49.011 --> 10:51.072
I think you the only campers
we've had in over a year.

10:51.096 --> 10:52.097
Seriously?

10:52.556 --> 10:53.658
Seriously.

10:53.682 --> 10:55.722
When the big highway went
in, people stopped coming.

10:55.893 --> 10:58.103
Good thing you
don't get paid per visitor.

10:59.438 --> 11:00.439
No offense.

11:00.731 --> 11:01.791
Don't worry about it.

11:01.815 --> 11:03.502
I'm technically a
government employee,

11:03.526 --> 11:05.754
and I have seniority,
so I'm fine either way.

11:05.778 --> 11:06.880
Yeah.

11:06.904 --> 11:09.198
Well, thanks a lot. And
how much do we owe you?

11:09.365 --> 11:11.125
Don't worry about it.
You kids just have fun.

11:11.283 --> 11:12.636
- Oh?
- Are you sure?

11:12.660 --> 11:13.700
Will you get into trouble?

11:13.953 --> 11:16.393
If I told them I had campers,
they wouldn't believe me anyway.

11:16.914 --> 11:18.892
- Well thanks again.
- Be smart out there.

11:18.916 --> 11:20.769
Don't leave food out,
in case of animals.

11:20.793 --> 11:22.312
- Will do. See ya.
- Thanks.

11:22.336 --> 11:23.379
Have a good one.

11:45.776 --> 11:46.777
This is nice.

11:47.111 --> 11:48.737
It's the forest! Of
course it's nice.

11:49.071 --> 11:50.799
You know what I mean!

11:50.823 --> 11:52.449
Pop the trunk, I'll
grab our things.

11:59.123 --> 12:00.374
Just grab what you need.

12:00.541 --> 12:01.542
Travel light,

12:01.709 --> 12:03.878
that way, we can take
a bit of a hike.

12:04.503 --> 12:05.943
- I thought you were tired?
- Well...

12:06.714 --> 12:08.299
Well, my eyes are tired, but...

12:08.924 --> 12:10.426
Don't mind stretching
my legs a bit.

12:11.594 --> 12:13.929
- Take in a bit of nature?
- At least it's still early.

12:14.346 --> 12:15.347
You got it!

12:15.890 --> 12:17.183
Let's have some
good natured fun.

12:17.474 --> 12:18.785
Ugh, very funny.

12:38.037 --> 12:40.515
...I spit on a guy who
is trying to date my mom...

12:40.539 --> 12:42.708
That
is actually mean.

12:43.209 --> 12:45.645
I wouldn't spit on
anyone else, just this guy.

12:45.669 --> 12:47.230
I swear, he
is really bad news.

12:47.254 --> 12:49.274
...bad news.

12:49.298 --> 12:50.938
Do you know what he
should've got instead?

12:51.133 --> 12:52.819
He should've got a hippopotamus.

12:52.843 --> 12:56.138
Ahh... Ok.

12:56.388 --> 12:57.389
What's that?

13:06.482 --> 13:07.983
- What about this?
- Nice.

13:08.943 --> 13:10.819
Yeah right. For
our camping spot?

13:11.153 --> 13:12.821
It's a little far from the car.

13:13.572 --> 13:15.699
Yeah, but it's a nice spot.

13:16.033 --> 13:18.077
A bit of clearing, a
little bit of shade.

13:18.786 --> 13:20.120
Sure, I suppose.

13:20.287 --> 13:21.515
Are you going to remember
where we parked,

13:21.539 --> 13:22.819
when you wake up in the morning?

13:23.457 --> 13:25.584
Course I will. I'm
the master tracker.

13:25.835 --> 13:27.002
Huh, course you are.

13:27.586 --> 13:28.587
Yeah.

13:28.754 --> 13:31.632
Now watch as the master
sets up some shelter.

13:36.804 --> 13:37.805
Yeah.

13:39.098 --> 13:40.140
Hey, Abby...

13:41.809 --> 13:43.495
there's something I want
to talk to you about.

13:43.519 --> 13:44.621
Oh, oh.

13:44.645 --> 13:46.063
Oh no. No, no, nothing bad.

13:46.355 --> 13:47.457
I want to thank you again,

13:47.481 --> 13:49.567
for bringing me along to
your sister's wedding.

13:50.818 --> 13:51.819
Of course.

13:52.361 --> 13:54.631
I mean, I know I'm your plus-one

13:54.655 --> 13:56.299
and not technically your
boyfriend or anything...

13:56.323 --> 13:57.491
What do you mean?

13:58.701 --> 13:59.702
Well...

14:01.996 --> 14:03.497
I really enjoy your
company and...

14:04.373 --> 14:06.584
that's why I wanted to come
along on this trip with you.

14:07.543 --> 14:10.337
No. What do you mean, you
aren't really my boyfriend?

14:10.838 --> 14:11.839
Huh?

14:12.882 --> 14:13.883
Well...

14:14.008 --> 14:15.968
we spend almost all
our time together.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.970
I mean, you've met my parents,
who like you, by the way.

14:18.971 --> 14:21.199
And... you came along
with me on this trip,

14:21.223 --> 14:22.325
with no questions asked.

14:22.349 --> 14:24.268
I'd say you are,
indeed, my boyfriend.

14:24.810 --> 14:27.271
Hmm... but we never formally...

14:27.438 --> 14:28.939
I don't think that's
necessary, is it?

14:29.648 --> 14:30.649
Jeez!

14:31.609 --> 14:33.649
I already told all my friends
you were my boyfriend.

14:34.528 --> 14:36.155
- You serious?
- Yes.

14:36.572 --> 14:38.091
Oh no,

14:38.115 --> 14:40.177
you weren't just about to
let me down easy, were you?

14:40.201 --> 14:42.137
What? No! No!

14:42.161 --> 14:43.162
No.

14:44.163 --> 14:45.372
I was...

14:45.581 --> 14:46.832
just going to ask you...

14:47.750 --> 14:48.751
you know...

14:49.251 --> 14:50.961
wanted to be my
girlfriend, or something?

14:51.086 --> 14:53.255
Oh yes! Sure, of course.

14:53.589 --> 14:55.591
Oh... good.

14:55.799 --> 14:57.719
Weird, I didn't think it
would go down like this.

14:58.427 --> 15:00.471
I think we should
probably kiss now.

15:10.231 --> 15:11.232
Ah...

15:11.398 --> 15:12.918
how long ago did you
tell all your friends

15:12.942 --> 15:14.235
that I was your boyfriend?

15:15.069 --> 15:16.195
Three months ago.

15:17.905 --> 15:19.823
Well, happy three
month anniversary.

15:22.368 --> 15:24.036
- Let's get this tent up.
- Right.

15:44.807 --> 15:45.808
How you doing?

15:46.016 --> 15:48.018
- I'm alright.
- You comfy?

15:48.561 --> 15:51.039
It's not the most
uncomfortable I've ever been.

15:52.565 --> 15:54.045
Should have brought
those lawn chairs.

15:54.191 --> 15:55.471
No, no. You wanted
to hike a bit?

15:55.609 --> 15:57.278
They would have been,
a pain to carry.

15:58.279 --> 15:59.714
Well, maybe we
should have camped

15:59.738 --> 16:01.098
closer to the car,
like you wanted?

16:01.657 --> 16:03.659
Mike it's fine! Don't
worry about it.

16:04.118 --> 16:05.661
I'm having a good time.

16:06.745 --> 16:08.497
Would you be happier
if I got the chairs?

16:08.956 --> 16:11.333
If you would be happier with
a chair, that's up to you.

16:11.834 --> 16:15.004
I'm actually tired from
hiking and the drive.

16:16.422 --> 16:19.300
I might not be able to keep
my eyes open much longer.

16:23.679 --> 16:25.890
I should go get those chairs.

16:26.432 --> 16:27.766
Mike, don't worry about it.

16:29.018 --> 16:30.686
The snacks are in the car too.

16:31.478 --> 16:32.479
Oh.

16:33.189 --> 16:34.190
That's different.

16:35.441 --> 16:36.775
Mike, don't go.

16:36.901 --> 16:38.545
It's dark and you don't
know these woods

16:38.569 --> 16:39.695
well enough to do it.

16:40.029 --> 16:41.631
Look, I'm just kidding. OK.

16:41.655 --> 16:43.157
I am not going to go to the car.

16:43.699 --> 16:45.034
I'm just going to
check the woods,

16:45.159 --> 16:47.369
take care of a little business,
if you know what I mean?

16:47.786 --> 16:49.079
- Promise?
- Promise.

16:49.663 --> 16:51.165
I'll be back before you know it.

18:09.243 --> 18:10.244
Mike?

19:15.768 --> 19:16.769
Mike?

19:20.981 --> 19:22.900
Dammit Mike, I told you
not to go to the car!

19:28.197 --> 19:29.990
Where the hell is
the car anyway?

19:43.671 --> 19:44.797
Dammit!

20:01.647 --> 20:02.648
Mike?

20:12.241 --> 20:13.242
Mike?

20:15.744 --> 20:16.871
Where are you?

20:21.834 --> 20:22.835
Mike?

20:32.469 --> 20:33.470
Mike?

21:16.263 --> 21:17.473
Mike!

21:29.652 --> 21:30.653
Mike?

21:32.321 --> 21:33.322
Mike?

21:35.658 --> 21:36.659
Help!

22:52.067 --> 22:53.068
Mike?

28:28.863 --> 28:29.864
Where is it?

32:21.762 --> 32:22.888
Abby.

32:25.015 --> 32:26.016
It's me.

32:27.184 --> 32:28.185
Mike?

32:29.562 --> 32:30.771
Mike, thank god!

32:31.605 --> 32:32.765
You have to be careful, Abby,

32:33.065 --> 32:34.525
There's a wolf nearby.

32:34.942 --> 32:35.943
I heard it,

32:36.193 --> 32:37.653
I think it's been following me.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.281
I know.

32:41.365 --> 32:42.366
But it's OK now,

32:42.867 --> 32:44.285
I'm going to get
you out of here.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.162
I'm so tired.

32:47.913 --> 32:49.999
I know you are Abby, but
you have to stay awake.

32:50.457 --> 32:52.793
If you don't, the
wolf will come back.

32:55.838 --> 32:57.089
Where've you been, Mike?

32:57.965 --> 33:00.176
I wanted to do something
romantic for you, but...

33:01.468 --> 33:02.469
I got lost.

33:04.054 --> 33:05.931
But it's alright, I'm here now.

33:06.599 --> 33:07.600
I found you,

33:07.933 --> 33:09.935
and I'm never going
to leave you again.

33:12.354 --> 33:13.814
My leg's really messed up.

33:15.399 --> 33:16.400
I can barely walk.

33:18.319 --> 33:20.529
I don't know how much longer
I can make it out here?

33:22.448 --> 33:23.574
I need to eat something!

33:25.492 --> 33:26.785
It will all be over soon Abby.

33:31.081 --> 33:32.917
Don't leave me again, Mike.

33:36.504 --> 33:37.784
I have some bad news sweetheart.

33:40.966 --> 33:43.802
- What is it?
- The fire went out.

34:02.238 --> 34:03.822
Where are you, you bitch!

34:10.871 --> 34:11.871
Come and get me!

34:13.623 --> 34:16.752
Not as easy to kill me now that
I'm awake, you sneaky arsehole!

34:19.672 --> 34:20.755
Come and get me!

34:45.989 --> 34:47.616
Hey miss, are you alright?

34:48.199 --> 34:50.040
Man, she's
all kinds of messed up.

34:50.828 --> 34:52.288
Miss, are you alright?

34:53.496 --> 34:54.998
I don't think she heard me?

34:55.833 --> 34:58.961
She can hear ya. I think
she's in shock or something.

35:00.963 --> 35:02.047
- Who are you?
- whoa!

35:02.715 --> 35:04.355
- Who the hell are you?
- Hey, whoa, whoa!

35:05.009 --> 35:06.194
We friends, all right.

35:06.218 --> 35:07.845
Look, see...

35:08.929 --> 35:09.930
friends.

35:12.308 --> 35:13.350
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

35:13.767 --> 35:16.687
I'm gonna take my jacket
off and put it on you, OK?

35:17.688 --> 35:19.690
You might be in some sort
of shock or something?

35:19.940 --> 35:21.567
This is just gonna
help warm you up.

35:30.492 --> 35:31.827
We have a cabin nearby.

35:32.870 --> 35:34.538
Let's get you out
of these elements.

35:57.561 --> 35:58.562
Come on now.

36:03.400 --> 36:04.544
Let's get you inside.

36:04.568 --> 36:06.195
Do you live here?

36:08.113 --> 36:10.032
No, we come here to hunt.

36:10.824 --> 36:11.885
Sorry.

36:11.909 --> 36:13.011
Nothing to be sorry about.

36:13.035 --> 36:14.036
Glen. Albert,

36:15.079 --> 36:16.806
Why don't you get the
stuff out of the truck.

36:16.830 --> 36:18.415
I'll help the lady get inside.

36:19.875 --> 36:20.876
Nope! No.

36:21.168 --> 36:22.294
Not that cabin.

36:22.920 --> 36:23.921
This one.

36:25.548 --> 36:26.841
What's in that cabin?

36:28.133 --> 36:29.510
You don't want to
go in that cabin.

36:29.927 --> 36:32.012
That's where we take the
animals that we've hunted,

36:32.304 --> 36:33.973
and skin 'em, cut them up...

36:34.849 --> 36:36.058
things like that.

36:36.517 --> 36:38.453
Not a place you want
to be, right now.

36:38.477 --> 36:39.478
Thank you.

36:39.854 --> 36:40.980
Don't mention it.

36:52.575 --> 36:54.034
Oh my god, thank you.

36:59.832 --> 37:02.001
Can you please take
this trap off my leg?

37:03.502 --> 37:05.004
It hurts so much.

37:05.629 --> 37:06.630
In a minute.

37:07.214 --> 37:08.775
You may have hit an
artery or something,

37:08.799 --> 37:10.634
we don't want you to bleed out.

37:14.597 --> 37:15.848
Do you have anything to eat?

37:17.224 --> 37:18.392
I'm starving.

37:19.810 --> 37:21.270
I
have some jerky.

37:23.564 --> 37:24.607
Thank you.

37:36.744 --> 37:37.912
Do you have a phone?

37:38.287 --> 37:39.288
No.

37:39.705 --> 37:40.706
No phones.

37:44.293 --> 37:45.419
What about a cell phone?

37:46.003 --> 37:47.379
One of you must
have a cell phone?

37:47.546 --> 37:49.632
Look, we come here to get away.

37:50.674 --> 37:52.801
Go off the grid as people
are fond of saying.

37:53.511 --> 37:55.304
First rules is no phones.

37:57.765 --> 37:59.266
What if one of you
has an accident?

38:01.519 --> 38:02.978
We don't have accidents.

38:04.688 --> 38:05.689
Right!

38:08.067 --> 38:09.944
Maybe one of you
guys saw my friend?

38:10.819 --> 38:11.820
Your friend?

38:13.489 --> 38:15.282
I came here with my
boyfriend, Mike.

38:17.076 --> 38:19.453
We got separated and I haven't
been able to find him.

38:21.455 --> 38:23.332
I don't... remember
seeing anyone.

38:24.208 --> 38:25.251
What did he look like?

38:27.253 --> 38:28.587
Brownish, curly hair.

38:29.672 --> 38:30.714
Late twenties.

38:31.507 --> 38:33.217
He was wearing a blue T-shirt.

38:35.761 --> 38:38.389
I don't remember seeing
anyone like that.

38:39.265 --> 38:40.826
Do you remember seeing
anyone like that?

38:40.850 --> 38:42.369
I haven't seen anyone like that.

38:42.393 --> 38:43.495
What about you Albert,

38:43.519 --> 38:45.039
do you recall seeing
someone like that?

38:45.312 --> 38:47.106
Nope, I don't think so.

38:48.816 --> 38:51.360
You know what, now I
think about it...

38:52.736 --> 38:54.047
I do seem to remember

38:54.071 --> 38:56.615
someone down by the highway.

38:57.241 --> 38:58.321
Do you remember that, Glen?

38:58.492 --> 39:00.202
You know what, I
think you right.

39:00.578 --> 39:01.638
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:01.662 --> 39:02.722
A young fella down
by the highway.

39:02.746 --> 39:03.747
You remember that Albert?

39:04.290 --> 39:06.292
Yeah, that kind of rings a bell.

39:07.459 --> 39:09.170
Yeah, I think he
was hitchhiking.

39:10.254 --> 39:11.255
Hitchhiking?

39:12.298 --> 39:15.676
Yeah, if he caught a ride
he could be miles away.

39:16.051 --> 39:17.595
We didn't stop to pick him up.

39:18.470 --> 39:20.470
You never know what kind
of weirdo's are out there.

39:21.140 --> 39:22.868
I don't know why he
would be hitchhiking,

39:22.892 --> 39:24.059
we came in a car.

39:25.269 --> 39:26.854
Look I don't know
what to tell you,

39:27.521 --> 39:28.522
Maybe we saw him?

39:29.356 --> 39:30.441
Maybe we didn't?

39:31.692 --> 39:34.254
But right now, your
leg's really messed up

39:34.278 --> 39:36.118
and we should probably
do something about that.

39:37.990 --> 39:39.533
How far away is the hospital?

39:39.867 --> 39:42.745
Don't you
worry about no hospital.

39:43.454 --> 39:45.122
We can fix you up
fine, right here.

39:46.624 --> 39:47.625
Right.

39:47.958 --> 39:50.419
I think I'd rather go to the
hospital, if you don't mind.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.440
Look, with you right
now like that,

39:53.464 --> 39:54.798
you can barely move.

39:55.424 --> 39:57.760
We'll fix you up here, then...

39:57.968 --> 39:59.136
go to the hospital later.

40:00.304 --> 40:01.305
I don't know...

40:03.182 --> 40:04.433
Let me get my stuff.

40:10.898 --> 40:13.734
Can one of you, please
take me to the hospital?

40:16.695 --> 40:19.615
Can one of you guys please
take me to the hospital.

40:21.408 --> 40:22.743
No hospitals, all right.

40:22.952 --> 40:23.953
Look...

40:25.371 --> 40:27.331
good ol' Tom's gonna
take care of you, OK.

40:27.915 --> 40:30.417
Boys, grab her arms.

40:31.836 --> 40:32.837
What?

40:33.087 --> 40:34.713
This is really gonna hurt.

40:34.839 --> 40:36.173
Oh... oh.

40:45.683 --> 40:47.434
I told you this was gonna hurt.

42:09.225 --> 42:10.518
Oh my...

42:11.227 --> 42:12.228
Oh my god.

42:19.944 --> 42:21.362
- Mike?
- Run.

44:10.012 --> 44:11.555
Wakey, wakey, little snakey.

44:14.642 --> 44:16.101
I see you found your boyfriend.

44:18.187 --> 44:19.188
My mistake.

44:20.064 --> 44:21.440
I guess he wasn't hitchhiking.

44:25.319 --> 44:26.403
Who are you?

44:27.530 --> 44:28.531
What do you want?

44:29.657 --> 44:31.867
Relax... you'll hurt yourself.

44:33.869 --> 44:35.162
Why did you kill Mike?

44:36.789 --> 44:38.624
He didn't do anything to you.

44:41.377 --> 44:42.657
I don't think you
get it sweetie.

44:44.004 --> 44:45.005
We're hunters.

44:46.215 --> 44:47.508
He's not an animal.

44:48.300 --> 44:50.010
You don't hunt people.

44:51.262 --> 44:54.306
We hunt whoever we
damn well feel like.

44:57.685 --> 44:58.853
Are you going to eat us?

45:01.146 --> 45:02.439
What are you talking about?

45:03.274 --> 45:05.734
We're not fucking
weirdo's that eat people.

45:07.111 --> 45:09.154
Then why are you doing this?

45:11.615 --> 45:12.700
We kill things...

45:13.534 --> 45:16.203
because we like to
watch them die.

45:17.580 --> 45:18.581
That's it.

45:21.542 --> 45:22.585
Oh my god.

45:24.503 --> 45:25.504
You're sick!

45:27.965 --> 45:29.151
I really don't think
you are in a position

45:29.175 --> 45:30.634
to judge me right now.

45:33.470 --> 45:34.763
You can't do this.

45:36.765 --> 45:38.017
The cops will come.

45:39.101 --> 45:40.102
That ranger!

45:40.978 --> 45:43.814
He knows we're here,
he'll send for help.

45:46.442 --> 45:47.443
What ranger?

45:48.319 --> 45:51.363
The ranger at the station,
near the parking area.

45:52.573 --> 45:54.825
He saw Mike and me come here.

45:55.451 --> 45:56.952
He'll know we missing.

46:00.956 --> 46:02.499
I thought that place
was abandoned?

46:02.750 --> 46:04.460
Haven't seen anyone
there for years.

46:05.294 --> 46:06.354
Still...

46:06.378 --> 46:07.481
she says there's one back there,

46:07.505 --> 46:08.672
we can't take any risk.

46:09.465 --> 46:11.675
Albert, go to the
rangers station...

46:12.760 --> 46:14.094
get rid of their car

46:14.553 --> 46:16.639
and kill anyone you find there.

46:19.350 --> 46:20.619
Thanks for the heads up sweetie.

46:21.727 --> 46:23.521
Here we thought we
were all alone.

46:25.814 --> 46:27.233
Now we really gonna
have some fun.

47:37.720 --> 47:40.389
Hello there, how are you? What
can I help you with today?

47:47.688 --> 47:48.689
Well, there you go.

47:49.398 --> 47:50.733
Looks like Albert's
done his job.

47:51.984 --> 47:53.485
What are we going
to do with her?

47:53.944 --> 47:55.784
What do you think we going
do with her, stupid?

47:56.614 --> 47:57.615
We came here to hunt.

47:58.741 --> 47:59.742
We're going to hunt!

48:00.993 --> 48:02.119
She's all fucked up?

48:02.536 --> 48:03.936
It's not going to
be much of a hunt.

48:04.955 --> 48:06.373
Killing's my favorite
part anyway.

48:07.666 --> 48:09.126
What are you going to do?

48:11.337 --> 48:12.338
Well...

48:13.088 --> 48:15.299
you going to die, you
can be sure of that.

48:16.217 --> 48:17.218
But...

48:17.510 --> 48:19.053
we gonna give you a
fighting chance.

48:20.387 --> 48:21.388
What?

48:23.098 --> 48:24.099
We gonna let you go.

48:27.478 --> 48:28.604
You going to let me go?

48:30.773 --> 48:32.274
You get a thirty
minute head start.

48:34.985 --> 48:36.570
Head out, take a direction.

48:37.530 --> 48:38.697
And thirty minutes...

48:39.657 --> 48:40.908
we gonna come find you.

48:42.576 --> 48:44.745
When we catch ya, we going
to enjoy ourselves.

48:45.621 --> 48:47.957
Nothing we ever
catch ever dies...

48:48.457 --> 48:49.458
fast!

48:50.668 --> 48:51.669
You're insane.

48:54.296 --> 48:56.900
We can start the second
part now, if you prefer?

48:56.924 --> 48:57.925
No!

48:58.175 --> 48:59.176
No.

48:59.677 --> 49:00.886
Better get moving.

49:16.026 --> 49:17.945
This is gonna be the
easiest kill ever.

49:18.779 --> 49:19.780
No.

49:20.364 --> 49:22.074
This is gonna be the
easiest hunt ever.

49:23.909 --> 49:25.536
I plan on making the kill hard.

49:36.755 --> 49:37.756
Dammit!

49:43.470 --> 49:44.471
Keep moving.

49:53.147 --> 49:54.356
How long it's been?

49:54.607 --> 49:55.941
It's been a half hour?

49:58.652 --> 49:59.653
Close enough.

50:15.961 --> 50:16.962
Come on out!

50:36.815 --> 50:38.150
We're getting closer.

51:03.968 --> 51:04.969
Oh god.

51:09.598 --> 51:11.809
It's ok Miss. Help is here.

51:19.483 --> 51:20.818
This guy came to my cabin,

51:21.402 --> 51:23.779
tried to shoot me. But
I heard him coming.

51:26.031 --> 51:27.241
There's two more of them,

51:27.741 --> 51:28.742
they're after me.

51:29.326 --> 51:30.619
Well then...

52:15.039 --> 52:16.141
Let's get moving.

52:16.165 --> 52:17.485
His friends would
have heard that.

52:20.586 --> 52:21.921
Who the hell fired that shot?

52:22.630 --> 52:23.631
It's likely Albert.

52:24.048 --> 52:25.317
He might have met
up with the girl.

52:25.341 --> 52:26.342
Shit!

52:26.550 --> 52:27.927
I hope he didn't kill her?

52:28.552 --> 52:29.762
Let's go find out.

52:32.973 --> 52:35.017
Come on, you can do it.

52:37.686 --> 52:39.271
My cabin isn't too far.

52:39.480 --> 52:41.023
We'll radio for backup.

52:41.732 --> 52:43.108
Get you the hell out of here.

52:43.859 --> 52:45.569
Hey! Are you still with me?

52:46.111 --> 52:47.154
You made it this far,

52:47.613 --> 52:48.653
you're almost out of this.

52:49.490 --> 52:50.491
I'm sorry Mike!

52:51.992 --> 52:53.285
I'm so sorry!

52:54.245 --> 52:55.246
Come on.

52:55.788 --> 52:56.789
Just a little longer.

52:59.041 --> 53:00.042
Son of a bitch!

53:02.294 --> 53:03.295
Did the girl do this?

53:04.338 --> 53:05.398
No.

53:05.422 --> 53:06.549
Must have been that ranger.

53:06.882 --> 53:07.883
Now she' got some help.

53:08.300 --> 53:10.302
That makes things a
little complicated.

53:11.011 --> 53:12.888
That makes things
more interesting.

53:14.223 --> 53:15.224
Let's go.

53:24.942 --> 53:26.110
The sun's going down.

53:27.027 --> 53:28.507
If we can stay out
of sight till dark,

53:29.113 --> 53:31.490
it will be a hell of a lot
easier to avoid these guys.

53:32.116 --> 53:33.868
I don't know how much
longer I can do this?

53:34.910 --> 53:35.911
Come on kid.

53:36.287 --> 53:38.047
Didn't you tell me you
had wedding to get to?

53:38.497 --> 53:40.708
You've got to get through this,
you've got places to be.

53:41.750 --> 53:42.751
Oh, yeah.

53:43.252 --> 53:44.295
I almost forgot.

53:45.546 --> 53:46.547
Whose wedding is it?

53:46.881 --> 53:48.007
Talk to me. Whose wedding?

53:48.632 --> 53:50.551
- My sister.
- Older or younger?

53:51.093 --> 53:52.154
- Hey?
- Huh?

53:52.178 --> 53:53.304
Older or younger?

53:53.846 --> 53:54.847
Older.

53:55.389 --> 53:57.141
My older sister, Shelley.

53:58.017 --> 54:00.352
Are you in the wedding party?
Hey! Stay awake.

54:00.728 --> 54:01.888
Are you in the wedding party?

54:03.564 --> 54:05.691
- I want to sleep...
- No, no! Not yet.

54:05.983 --> 54:07.193
Oh, please not yet.

54:07.818 --> 54:08.879
Come on.

54:08.903 --> 54:10.063
Are you in the wedding party?

54:10.321 --> 54:11.423
Come on!

54:11.447 --> 54:12.781
- Talk to me?
- Bridesmaid.

54:14.742 --> 54:16.344
She would have made
me the Maid of Honor,

54:16.368 --> 54:17.846
but she had a friend
who guilt tripped her

54:17.870 --> 54:19.371
to making it her instead.

54:20.539 --> 54:22.291
Less responsibility
for you then, right?

54:23.375 --> 54:24.585
Come on, let's go.

54:25.878 --> 54:26.962
I need a doctor.

54:28.547 --> 54:30.341
Yeah. Yeah you do.

54:32.760 --> 54:33.761
Parking lot is closer.

54:34.345 --> 54:35.825
Maybe I can get you
in my car instead.

54:37.264 --> 54:38.265
Are you ready?

54:39.058 --> 54:40.059
No.

54:41.644 --> 54:43.812
- But I've places to be.
- That's right.

54:44.230 --> 54:45.231
Let's move.

54:53.155 --> 54:54.156
What's wrong?

54:55.616 --> 54:56.617
Stand back kid.

54:57.326 --> 54:58.446
I think I tripped something.

55:07.670 --> 55:10.339
Get... to the car...

55:34.405 --> 55:35.990
Well, there's one problem down.

55:37.074 --> 55:40.035
I wish he'd given us the curtsey
of living a few minutes longer.

55:40.578 --> 55:42.621
We could watch the
life leave his eyes.

55:43.998 --> 55:45.165
Can't win them all, I guess.

55:46.208 --> 55:48.127
Let's make up for
it with the girl.

55:48.711 --> 55:50.379
Sure as hell couldn't
have gotten far.

55:51.422 --> 55:52.756
Then let's keep
the chatter down.

55:53.299 --> 55:54.300
Come on.

56:25.372 --> 56:26.789
This kid's given us more trouble

56:26.790 --> 56:28.083
wounded than her boyfriend did.

56:28.834 --> 56:29.835
He was in tip-top shape.

56:30.336 --> 56:31.837
Yeah, but it's not all bad news.

56:33.130 --> 56:34.757
She's only got one place to go.

56:35.883 --> 56:37.009
That ranger station!

56:37.510 --> 56:38.969
Besides she's so fucked up!

56:39.345 --> 56:40.346
We've the upper hand.

56:40.763 --> 56:41.764
- You're right.
- I know.

56:42.056 --> 56:43.241
And what I say
about the chatter?

56:45.434 --> 56:46.810
- Hear something?
- Yeah.

56:47.853 --> 56:49.855
- You think it's her?
- Shut up for a second!

57:04.703 --> 57:05.704
Go check.

57:14.964 --> 57:15.965
Wasn't her.

57:16.465 --> 57:17.550
It was a raccoon.

57:23.222 --> 57:24.223
Ow!

57:30.855 --> 57:31.981
Glen, I'm coming!

57:35.192 --> 57:37.611
Go! Get that bitch!

57:43.200 --> 57:44.201
Where are you?

57:45.536 --> 57:47.454
Come out where I can see ya!

58:04.138 --> 58:05.139
My leg!

58:21.864 --> 58:23.991
You stay away... I'll kill you!

59:10.871 --> 59:12.623
Come on! This's getting tedious.

59:14.750 --> 59:16.085
You're almost dead anyway.

59:17.336 --> 59:19.136
May as well let me put
you out of your misery.

59:26.846 --> 59:27.847
You're dead meat.

01:00:19.273 --> 01:00:22.026
Get away from me.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:24.403
No.

01:00:25.404 --> 01:00:26.506
No!

01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:27.531
No!

01:02:34.283 --> 01:02:35.284
Help!

01:02:37.411 --> 01:02:38.412
Please send help!
