To Kitty. With you home, the circle is complete.

00:07.200 --> 00:10.600
I was afraid of the things I didn't want to say.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.110
Well, let's just say it, that 
I sent Justin to war, that I put 
him on the front lines, that's ridiculous.

00:15.160 --> 00:17.500
He trusted you. He asked you.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.877
All right, so, Dad, right? 
I'm at the office the other day 
and I saw something.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.199
Her name's Holly Harper. 
She and Dad have been friends for years.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.592
What if I can really make a difference?

00:26.700 --> 00:29.279
By being an 11:30 smartass on TV?

00:29.300 --> 00:32.100
Dad, something's not right with the company.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.766
Where did all the money go, Saul?

00:33.900 --> 00:35.201
You think I have it?

00:35.400 --> 00:38.161
No, Saul, we need to have something that makes sense.

00:39.242 --> 00:40.807
The pension funds?

00:41.100 --> 00:43.137
- Grandpa?
- Get your grandmother. Now!

00:44.100 --> 00:45.523
Dad, what have you done?

02:32.240 --> 02:34.664
There's just no escaping him in this house.

02:36.132 --> 02:37.350
No, there never was.

02:37.800 --> 02:42.961
You know, I lived in New York for so long, I barely saw him. I shouldn't be missing him this much.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.525
Of course you should. It's only been three weeks.

02:46.200 --> 02:50.066
Three weeks....God.

02:50.739 --> 02:52.499
Are you sure you wanna stay here?

02:52.700 --> 02:55.462
Yeah! Yeah, I have to.

02:55.800 --> 02:56.815
Mom needs me.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.341
Oh my God, I have so much stuff.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.134
I know. I'm starting to wonder what Jonathan got in the break-up.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.404
We are not broken up, Kevin.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.651
This is just us, giving each other a little space.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.943
He wants me to be here, and he wants me to do the show.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.130
Sure he does. So, when does the show start, anyway?

03:15.400 --> 03:20.722
Tomorrow. We're discussing ballot tampering in the swing states. You better watch it.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.600
Wow! Who said politics isn't sexy?

03:24.500 --> 03:26.481
OK. I'm off to work.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.491
Mommy, where's my grass skirt?

03:30.200 --> 03:31.234
Oh my God!

03:31.234 --> 03:33.737
Oh, don't tell me. You said that she would get it.

03:33.787 --> 03:36.374
Mom, we're doing the states for school. I'm Hawaii.

03:36.457 --> 03:38.217
Hey, Babe. What if we make one out of paper?

03:38.267 --> 03:40.434
I can't be Hawaii without a grass skirt.

03:40.484 --> 03:43.036
You guys promised I could have one, a real one!

03:43.397 --> 03:48.007
You said that you'd go to the party store, you remember? We talked about this. I got lessons all day, I can't...

03:48.057 --> 03:50.802
I will, I will. I'll go today. See? I won't forget.

03:56.136 --> 03:59.814
I thought the whole point of giving up the big corporate job for the family business was, you know...

04:02.800 --> 04:03.586
So did I.

04:07.600 --> 04:11.664
- Hey, Josh!
- Cool. Hi, Mrs. Whedon.
- Aloha...

04:17.810 --> 04:19.439
So, any plans for the afternoon?

04:20.200 --> 04:21.925
You know, it is so funny...

04:21.975 --> 04:26.765
the minute the funeral was over, then virtually every single conversation over the past three weeks

04:26.815 --> 04:33.207
has contained some variation of: "Are you keeping busy?" "Are you filling your days?" "Are you moving on?"

04:33.257 --> 04:33.871
So are you?

04:33.921 --> 04:35.858
Yes. Yes.

04:38.124 --> 04:38.953
Sometimes.

04:41.106 --> 04:42.883
And then, sometimes, it gets very, very quiet.

04:45.300 --> 04:49.353
But, Kitty's moving in. That's....great.

04:52.683 --> 04:57.670
I have this idea, I think you should move in, too, and then the house would be really, really alive.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.717
I'm kidding!

05:01.307 --> 05:03.155
- Oh, God. Don't do that!
- I'm kidding you.

05:03.736 --> 05:06.512
Wow! You're on... you're actually early.

05:06.562 --> 05:09.755
Your award is to help me carry heavy boxes up a long flight of stairs.ÉÏ

05:11.300 --> 05:13.633
Mom, where's, ah...where's Dad's address book?

05:13.700 --> 05:16.957
I just want to write Manny over at Rousseau's to say thanks for hiring me.

05:17.007 --> 05:21.237
Honey, that's so sweet. Just look in his rolodex, which is on his desk in his office.

05:21.287 --> 05:22.052
OK, great. Thanks.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.701
You wanna help me with the boxes? No? Later? OK... I'm fine.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.678
You know, I think he's turning over a new leaf, I ...

05:29.728 --> 05:32.422
really do. I think he's doing so much better than...

05:33.800 --> 05:37.800
Look at her reading habits. Who knew there were so many biographies on Ronald Reagan?

05:38.600 --> 05:44.799
You know, this is such a bad idea. She should be in a nice little house, at least five miles away, with uniformed guards between you.

05:44.849 --> 05:48.124
Just stop. I had to let her stay here.

05:48.174 --> 05:51.460
Dad's gone. Jonathan's back in New York. She needs me.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.914
What time is everybody else getting here, huh?

05:54.964 --> 05:59.382
I don't know why you had to make such a big deal out of this reading of the will. You could've just emailed everybody.

05:59.432 --> 06:02.404
That's the way it's done, OK? That's the way Dad wanted it, so...

06:03.600 --> 06:06.553
God, what does she have in here? The original Federalist papers?

06:07.000 --> 06:07.789
Probably.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.690
I'm Justin Walker.

06:51.901 --> 06:53.656
I know who you are.

06:55.300 --> 06:57.951
I saw you at my dad's office the day before he died.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.746
Um, we were doing business.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.033
I saw you again at the funeral.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.533
We were friends.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.057
I don't think so.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.862
See...I remember you from a long time ago.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.354
Yes, you do.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.911
How long have you two, ah...?

07:25.200 --> 07:26.414
Long enough.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.659
Who else knows about you and my father?

07:32.200 --> 07:33.062
Saul.

07:33.900 --> 07:34.764
Anyone else?

07:35.000 --> 07:35.925
No.

07:40.745 --> 07:41.913
I'm so sorry.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.071
Before I show this to you,

08:00.700 --> 08:05.048
let's just remember that we're family and we all want the same thing: to get back to something good.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.471
Here.

08:07.700 --> 08:08.540
What is this?

08:08.600 --> 08:12.668
Tommy, you wanted proof that I don't bear all the responsibility of what happened to the company,

08:12.718 --> 08:18.441
well, here it is. If you look over here, you'll see that your dad sold a million dollars of his own stock in the company to the pension fund.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.688
Right. I see that. So?

08:20.900 --> 08:24.368
He made the pension fund pay him $15 million for it.

08:24.418 --> 08:26.448
He inflated the value of the stock.

08:26.900 --> 08:29.054
And now the company is on the verge of bankruptcy.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.009
Why would he do something like this?

08:32.299 --> 08:33.448
It doesn't make sense.

08:33.799 --> 08:34.505
We have to find out.

08:34.554 --> 08:36.500
No, the first thing we have to do is go to the authorities.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.107
Sarah, you can't do that!

08:38.200 --> 08:39.982
Don't you think I would have done it.

08:41.299 --> 08:42.808
I want you to think about your mother!

08:42.857 --> 08:44.500
How would she respond to this?

08:45.800 --> 08:48.591
No, we can't tell anyone in the family about this. Anyone.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.307
What is it that you're suggesting we do, Saul?

08:51.500 --> 08:54.327
I'm suggesting we do what families do. We stick together.

08:55.192 --> 09:00.843
We rebuild. We go back to where we were. We repay the debt together. And move on,

09:01.127 --> 09:02.321
together, as a family.

09:02.321 --> 09:03.674
As a family of criminals?

09:03.724 --> 09:05.823
No, no. I won't.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.275
I won't do that.

09:11.800 --> 09:12.617
OK.

09:14.171 --> 09:17.199
OK, well, we have to go to your mother's.

09:23.400 --> 09:27.402
Yeah... let's see what else the man left us.

09:34.100 --> 09:34.674
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:35.172 --> 09:37.422
- Hey.
- Look at you, the family lawyer.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.301
You've got your bad news face on.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.271
No, I don't.

09:40.700 --> 09:44.252
Yeah, this is like when Dad had you sent in to tell me Bingo had been hit by a car.

09:44.272 --> 09:47.144
Bingo.....he loved to chase things.

09:47.194 --> 09:48.284
This is not like Bingo!

09:49.200 --> 09:50.090
Let's hope not.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.216
This isn't going to be like Bingo, is it?

09:55.266 --> 09:56.296
Don't ask me that.

09:57.400 --> 10:02.765
The last piece of company business to be addressed is, of course, the line of succession at Ojai Foods.

10:04.600 --> 10:05.515
Justin...

10:05.600 --> 10:07.250
Sorry, Kit.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.536
Saul stays on as Chief Financial Officer.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.235
As it should be.

10:14.400 --> 10:19.407
Tommy continues as Vice President of Operations and Sarah is to be President of the company.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.888
All personal assets obviously...

10:27.200 --> 10:29.042
Dad's wishes, guys, OK?

10:29.500 --> 10:31.548
All personal assets obviously go to Mom...

10:32.100 --> 10:35.227
and if...and when Mom dies...

10:35.500 --> 10:37.810
Thank you for the "if" Kevin, it was really sweet.

10:37.965 --> 10:38.528
You got it. Ah,

10:39.166 --> 10:42.031
the entire trust is then passed on, equally, to all of us

10:43.591 --> 10:45.639
with one notable exception,

10:47.500 --> 10:50.240
and uh, I apologize for having to be the one to say this to you.

10:50.289 --> 10:52.409
- What?
- Dad set it up so...

10:52.700 --> 10:55.660
After Mom's gone...

10:55.710 --> 10:59.915
your share of the inheritance will be kept in a conservatorship.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.658
Which is what? Like a museum?

11:03.300 --> 11:04.410
No, you'll get an allowance, and

11:04.510 --> 11:07.310
um, and Kitty will be the...

11:07.410 --> 11:08.697
What? The babysitter?

11:08.747 --> 11:09.425
Conservator.

11:10.200 --> 11:14.028
He knew how close you two are, so he ... he figured...

11:14.078 --> 11:16.436
What? That I was too messed up to handle my own finances?

11:16.486 --> 11:19.223
- No.
- No, I mean that's it, right? I'm an idiot!

11:19.223 --> 11:19.611
No.

11:19.661 --> 11:22.497
- When you're high like you are right now, yes.
- You know what? Go to hell, Tommy.

11:22.500 --> 11:23.100
Why don't you go to hell?

11:23.200 --> 11:24.362
Guys! Guys!

11:25.100 --> 11:27.523
You know, Justin. We'll...we'll work something out.

11:27.573 --> 11:33.717
You know, it's OK. Fine, right? I mean, this is what Dad wants, you know, it's freaking perfect.

11:33.767 --> 11:35.314
Kevin, why didn't you tell me this before?

11:35.364 --> 11:37.980
Because I'm acting as a lawyer now, OK, not as a son. I'm sorry.

11:38.457 --> 11:40.395
Justin, honey, don't go! Please.

11:40.445 --> 11:41.466
You know, I gotta go to work, Mom.

11:42.162 --> 11:46.486
That's what I deserve, right? I mean, I'm not as good as the rest of you. You're all such saints.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.327
I don't want his money, anyway. Thanks for the heads-up today.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.462
Bingo!

11:59.374 --> 12:00.524
<font color="#ffff00">Brothers & Sisters, 1x02</font>

12:05.500 --> 12:08.554
I was just a receptionist, but even I could see it was fraud.

12:08.667 --> 12:14.961
And how exactly did you find out there was fraud taking place at Mangopian Insurance, Mr. Wandell?

12:15.400 --> 12:19.782
Because whenever I was bored, which was always, I eavesdropped on the salesmen's calls.

12:19.800 --> 12:20.671
What did you hear?

12:20.700 --> 12:24.822
2,000 senior citizens from Needles, California, being sold fraudulent insurance.

12:24.872 --> 12:25.662
That many?

12:27.100 --> 12:28.551
Did anyone ever ask you to lie?

12:28.601 --> 12:33.481
Oh my God! Oh my God, you're gay!

12:35.000 --> 12:38.265
If you could answer the question, 'cause these guys have lawyers that will shred you.

12:38.315 --> 12:40.441
I'm not being prepped anymore until you admit you're a gay.

12:43.600 --> 12:49.341
Yeah. Yeah, I am "a" gay, so...I mean, whatever.

12:51.421 --> 12:52.555
How did you know?

12:53.400 --> 12:56.487
So, you're like all in the closet? In this day and age?

12:56.537 --> 12:59.650
Ah, no, actually, I'm not in the closet at all. I'm open and proud.

12:59.650 --> 13:01.309
You're not proud. You're trying to pass.

13:03.197 --> 13:04.378
Wow! Is this your boyfriend?

13:05.000 --> 13:05.668
Ex.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.106
You looked much happier when you were younger....and gayer.

13:10.156 --> 13:13.853
You know, I'm having a not great day, I don't know if that matters to you, so can we just do this?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.442
Not even the house?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.738
I understand everything,

13:21.222 --> 13:23.890
but he didn't even leave me my house?

13:23.990 --> 13:24.643
Holly,

13:25.000 --> 13:25.700
It's all right.

13:25.800 --> 13:26.592
How could he?

13:27.100 --> 13:29.279
It's all right. I knew the rules.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.899
Women don't have affairs to be remembered in the will. That's why they get married.

13:37.858 --> 13:43.536
But, it does mean something... that you came to see me, to tell me.

13:44.387 --> 13:45.242
That you care.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.552
I do. I do care.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.327
It's what makes "this" so difficult, Holly.

13:52.500 --> 13:52.916
"This?"

13:53.200 --> 13:54.385
Triangulation?

13:55.376 --> 13:56.777
Look, Holly, I love my sister,

13:58.200 --> 14:00.400
and I think that that makes a friendship...

14:00.800 --> 14:04.349
between us...impossible.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.095
Yeah.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.800
I would have to lie to them, and I've had my fill of lying.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.151
I think you have, too.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.526
My sister, my nieces, and nephews,

14:16.500 --> 14:18.200
already Justin has

14:20.000 --> 14:21.349
I'm all they have now.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.400
I can't subject them to any more deception.

14:25.700 --> 14:28.582
No, of course you can't.

14:41.100 --> 14:48.334
Oh, hi, Mannyi. I'm sorry, the damn smoke alarm is going off.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.923
No. No, there's no fire, Manny.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.217
Would I be standing here talking to you if there were a fire?

14:57.800 --> 15:02.375
Listen, I do wanna thank you and everyone at Rousseau's for

15:04.969 --> 15:06.189
for hiring Justin.

15:07.600 --> 15:13.587
Yeah, it's times like these that we really know who are friends are, that's for sure.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.442
And he seems to be doing so well.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.905
I'm sorry, Manny, you'll have to speak up. I can't hear you.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.007
What?

15:25.600 --> 15:27.037
He didn't show up today?

15:28.500 --> 15:30.247
He hasn't shown up all week?

15:32.000 --> 15:36.914
Oh, yes. Of course you have to let him go.

15:37.800 --> 15:38.861
I understand.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.995
You certainly did try.

15:41.900 --> 15:42.897
Thanks, Manny.

15:54.900 --> 15:58.534
It's basically one family's war. They're just making the whole country pay for it.

15:58.534 --> 16:00.295
Bush, Sr. never wanted Baghdad.

16:00.345 --> 16:03.686
Oh, no, he just wanted to protect the Kuwaitis, right? Come on.

16:04.100 --> 16:07.043
You know, if we inherited this war from anybody, it was Bill Clinton who decided...

16:07.093 --> 16:11.719
who was a helluva lot more proactive in the Mid East peace process than this president ever even dreamt of being...

16:11.900 --> 16:17.556
Right, until he decided that cheap, blue dresses were a lot more alluring than his credibility as leader of the free world, and not to mention......

16:17.606 --> 16:22.593
I am so tired of this Puritanical nonsense! The man was a human being, for God's sakes.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.500
Hello, Nora Walker, Kitty's mom.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.223
- Big fan.
- Of mine?

16:27.273 --> 16:30.200
I want you to know your take on immigration is absolutely right,

16:30.600 --> 16:33.493
I'd be ashamed to live in a country with a wall. It makes me sick.

16:33.500 --> 16:33.900
Thank you!

16:34.100 --> 16:35.133
- Mom? 
- What?

16:35.183 --> 16:36.239
What the hell are you doing here?

16:39.200 --> 16:40.946
He hasn't come into work for three days.

16:41.000 --> 16:41.700
Where is he now?

16:41.800 --> 16:42.000
I don't know,

16:42.200 --> 16:43.888
he might be at home, but he's not answering,

16:43.900 --> 16:44.800
we should go over.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.302
Why we? Why me?

16:46.347 --> 16:47.380
This is your fault.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.400
How is this my fault?

16:49.600 --> 16:51.660
You're the one who told him to go fight in that stupid war.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.412
Oh, Mom, Dad was the one who told him it was the right thing to do.

16:54.462 --> 16:56.113
But, Kitty, you pushed him.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.363
Justin is who he is.

16:58.800 --> 17:03.372
I didn't convince him to enlist any more than you convinced him to raid your medicine cabinet at age 16...

17:03.422 --> 17:07.448
or to-- or to get himself kicked out of college for selling 'shrooms in the back of his car.

17:07.469 --> 17:08.988
He never wanted to be a soldier.

17:09.088 --> 17:12.902
That's what you and your father never understood. He just wanted your approval.

17:13.050 --> 17:17.579
You were supposed to say "no." You were supposed to say, "We love you too much to let you get hurt like this. No."

17:18.000 --> 17:19.548
And now I don't know where my son is.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.811
I need you to help me find him. Please.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.734
- OK. Let's go.
- OK. Let's go.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.597
Great shoes.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.775
Don't ask. What are you guys doing here?

17:39.200 --> 17:40.197
We need to talk.

17:44.400 --> 17:48.504
So, we're talking serious embezzlement. At Ojai Foods.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.394
- Yeah.
- And Dad was responsible?

17:52.500 --> 17:57.506
Saul claims Dad made a bad investment, been draining the pension fund to cover it up.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.039
I'm not convinced.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.688
That doesn't matter. You have to go to the authorities.

18:01.738 --> 18:03.800
No, no, no. We need to find out what Dad was doing.

18:03.900 --> 18:04.900
He must have had a reason.

18:05.000 --> 18:05.800
Are you not getting it?

18:06.000 --> 18:07.917
I get it! I just don't agree.

18:08.017 --> 18:09.916
Well, you're president now. What do you wanna do?

18:12.200 --> 18:13.066
Go to hell!

18:15.900 --> 18:18.397
Tommy! Tommy!

18:20.900 --> 18:23.330
Sarah, trust your gut. Do you wanna go down for a crime you inherited?

18:28.700 --> 18:33.388
OK. So, if we went to the authorities, what would it look like?

18:33.488 --> 18:38.852
It's Federal. I have a friend in the U.S. Attorney's Office. We could call him, but there'd be an investigation.

18:39.400 --> 18:43.149
You know, bean counters going through trash, subpoenaing the workers, the family...

18:43.500 --> 18:44.623
And they'd close us down?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.884
We might end up in receivorship, yeah, or forced into bankruptcy.

18:47.930 --> 18:49.715
Great. Sounds great.

18:49.765 --> 18:52.551
Look, I want you to be prepared. It would be ugly, OK?

18:52.800 --> 18:55.180
But the government will go easier if you approach them.

18:55.900 --> 18:56.796
That counts.

18:58.800 --> 19:03.124
And what about the employees? What about their retirement money? What happens to that?

19:11.200 --> 19:13.218
They'd either get very little or nothing.

19:14.800 --> 19:18.190
Look, it'll be worse if you wait, Sarah, you have to come forward.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.379
How am I going to tell Mom?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.194
U.S. Attorney Dan Sullivan.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.997
Please, please, call him.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.631
There's no other way, Sarah. I'm sorry.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.462
OK. Thanks.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.358
I have a key. I have a key in here somewhere.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.786
We don't need a key, Mom.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.673
Good Lord in Heaven!

20:12.300 --> 20:14.107
Oh...Mom.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.187
Wake her up.

20:20.237 --> 20:20.905
You do it!

20:20.955 --> 20:23.523
- You do it!
- You do it!
- Oh, for God's sakes.

20:31.100 --> 20:35.985
It's Fawn! It's Fawn, Fawn. Fawn, it's OK, it's OK. Hi. Hi. It's Kitty and Nora. Justin's...

20:37.000 --> 20:38.080
How did you guys get in here?

20:38.300 --> 20:42.391
The front door was unlocked. Where's Justin, Fawn?

20:42.600 --> 20:43.912
At work, right?

20:43.962 --> 20:46.933
No, he actually hasn't been showing up. They fired him.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.406
Those bastards.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.500
Do you have any idea where Justin might be?

20:51.200 --> 20:54.641
Not really. Um, Zuma or Venice?

20:55.120 --> 20:55.985
Pineburger?

20:56.035 --> 20:58.436
Are you covering for him?

21:00.200 --> 21:01.415
You can tell us.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.319
I swear.

21:03.369 --> 21:07.808
Mrs.- Justin. I don't know where he is.

21:08.400 --> 21:11.661
Oh. All right, my darling. We believe you.

21:12.400 --> 21:15.653
But, I really don't think this is very healthy.

21:15.900 --> 21:16.747
What's not?

21:16.797 --> 21:18.166
Medicating, sleeping all day...

21:18.216 --> 21:23.437
and you know, you don't look well. I don't think this situation is working out for you, is it?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.219
So, let's get ourselves up, get dressed,

21:29.800 --> 21:33.272
- take your trash and go home!
- Mom.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.762
You really don't know where he is?

21:40.666 --> 21:42.216
I thought he was at work.

21:44.300 --> 21:45.686
I'm not a bad girl.

21:45.900 --> 21:48.296
I'm sure you're not. You just need to get up earlier.

21:51.000 --> 21:51.700
You know? OK...

21:54.000 --> 21:56.450
The truck just broke down out of nowhere...

21:56.937 --> 21:59.751
Yeah, apparently, and, apparently, it's a real mess.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.539
What's wrong?

22:01.550 --> 22:02.891
I've got it under control.

22:02.941 --> 22:07.510
I'm sure you do, but could I at least know what it is that you're controlling? Please.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.400
Look, one of the rigs broke down in Bakersfield. 20 tons of peaches.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.381
- in 115 degrees.
- So we....

22:14.381 --> 22:17.080
Look, I said I have it under control. Go run your errand.

22:17.200 --> 22:20.215
- You have that thing to pick up for Paige, right?
- Right.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.118
Excuse me, guys. Could I just have a minute?

22:23.600 --> 22:24.452
Of course.

22:28.300 --> 22:29.946
So, is this how it's going to be?

22:30.000 --> 22:30.627
You tell me.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.609
Don't walk away from me again, Tommy.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.500
What? What are you gonna do, fire me?

22:35.600 --> 22:39.251
- I'm just trying to get a truck out there so we can salvage what we have.
- It's just a title.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.531
It's more than a title and you know it.

22:41.976 --> 22:44.850
- You ask most of the guys who runs this company, they'll say me.
- Good.

22:44.900 --> 22:47.043
They would've said the same when Dad was alive, too.

22:47.093 --> 22:48.618
I know. I know.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.629
I'm just saying.

22:52.700 --> 22:55.532
You wanna be president? Just say it.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.976
Say it. I'll step aside right now.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.254
Can I do my job?

23:02.562 --> 23:03.462
Please.

23:05.795 --> 23:08.624
- Sure.
- Thanks.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.486
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Noah.

23:17.300 --> 23:20.324
- Remember me? The guy you used to work with?
- Yeah.

23:20.900 --> 23:24.203
I just heard about your father. Ah, I'm sorry.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.779
Yeah, well, it's-- it's a mess.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.765
Would you like to grab some coffee?

23:30.100 --> 23:32.196
That's a spectacularly bad idea.

23:32.300 --> 23:34.939
You're right. I grabbed the wrong file.

23:35.383 --> 23:38.104
I meant to grab the file of "reasonably bad ideas,"

23:38.104 --> 23:41.205
but I grabbed the "spectacularly bad ones" instead.

23:41.836 --> 23:42.635
Been that kind of day.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.597
- Yeah.
- Come on. Just one.

23:52.400 --> 23:56.275
This is dumb, hanging out here waiting for him.

23:56.400 --> 24:00.928
Well, do you really wanna go on a tour of a video arcade or a $2 movie theater?

24:01.600 --> 24:03.758
Or he could be hiking in Griffith Park for all we know.

24:03.808 --> 24:04.867
I know, I know.

24:04.900 --> 24:08.649
We should've put one of those things that they put on dogs so you can track 'em.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.990
Don't be snippy with me. I'm not on your damn TV show.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.687
God, I hate this day.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.766
Well, I'm not exactly over the moon about it, either.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.838
I know what Jonathan would do.

24:21.400 --> 24:24.590
He would call some friend in Washington, and

24:24.640 --> 24:29.513
there'd be some really fancy, expensive detective here with Justin in about four hours.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.104
Well, why don't you call him?

24:33.000 --> 24:37.348
You know, you really can tell me the problem with him. I swear I won't judge.

24:38.800 --> 24:39.900
The problem...

24:42.000 --> 24:43.618
doesn't feel like you and Dad.

24:45.700 --> 24:47.669
I guess they don't make 'em like that anymore.

24:49.500 --> 24:52.118
Oh. Look.

24:56.415 --> 24:57.754
Oh, yeah...

24:58.500 --> 25:01.743
- We've just had too many damn blessings.
- Maybe.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.726
Hello? Yeah, Kevin. Hi.

25:08.500 --> 25:09.323
Is he all right?

25:11.400 --> 25:12.620
Oh, thank God.

25:13.400 --> 25:17.505
- All right, yeah, come pick us up. We're still at his place.
- Where is he?

25:17.505 --> 25:21.933
All right, bye. He's-a, he's in jail. Ah, in Oceanside.

25:21.983 --> 25:24.312
He was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.562
Dad left some serious problems with the company, beyond serious.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.012
You think you might have to shut it down?

25:35.800 --> 25:36.532
Maybe.

25:38.315 --> 25:39.264
Probably.

25:43.500 --> 25:47.192
I can't go into details. I can't even tell Joe.

25:48.300 --> 25:49.500
You know what they say at business school...

25:50.400 --> 25:54.100
almost all family businesses fail in successive generations. I mean...

25:55.100 --> 26:01.088
- if Ojai is already having problems...
- Then we should kick it to the curb, according to our M.BA.

26:01.138 --> 26:02.387
That's the smart play.

26:02.387 --> 26:03.677
It's not that easy.

26:04.184 --> 26:06.314
Losing Ojai'd devastate my family.

26:06.990 --> 26:07.700
Come on,

26:08.327 --> 26:10.659
you have no idea what families can survive.

26:11.761 --> 26:14.832
Besides, you are not responsible for everything, Sarah.

26:15.277 --> 26:17.514
You always took on everybody else's problems.

26:18.967 --> 26:22.127
You could come back to North Light today. You are on the fast track.

26:22.197 --> 26:25.342
No, that place was eating up my life.

26:25.670 --> 26:28.285
I need to make time for Paige and Cooper,

26:29.478 --> 26:30.282
and Joe.

26:30.772 --> 26:34.168
Then, why do you seem more stressed out now than ever?

26:34.800 --> 26:37.539
I mean, at least before, you weren't in it alone.

26:38.392 --> 26:39.038
Noah,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.536
Tell me something, how can you feel so guilty...

26:46.900 --> 26:49.748
when nothing happened between us?

26:50.400 --> 26:54.240
Because being in sync with a man who is not your husband

26:54.700 --> 26:58.428
is almost as painful as not being in sync with your husband.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.469
Don't you ever miss looking forward to something?

27:05.000 --> 27:09.779
You know, picking out your shoes, your shirt for somebody...everyday.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.928
Don't you miss that?

27:18.600 --> 27:19.980
Sarah, is your hand bleeding?

27:23.200 --> 27:28.089
Oh God! Oh! I suck!

27:28.300 --> 27:32.736
- What?
- Hawaii...my daughter is Hawaii. Noah, I'll call, OK?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.993
He needs to go into a treatment program again.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.805
I agree, even if it's outpatient.

27:41.855 --> 27:44.652
You know, a partner of mine just came back from Hazleton, Minnesota.

27:44.700 --> 27:49.665
I'm not sending my son to Minnesota. Very cold there this time of year.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.500
He needs some kind of professional help, Mom.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.300
I'm not saying he doesn't need help, Kevin,

27:54.400 --> 27:57.722
I'm just saying now's not the time to theorize about your poor brother

27:57.772 --> 27:59.421
as if he was some sort of case study.

27:59.564 --> 28:02.789
What needs to happen is we need to get down to this Oceanside place and

28:02.839 --> 28:05.325
get him out of jail, and take him home.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.923
Why didn't you tell me your father was going to insult him like that?

28:10.400 --> 28:12.329
Oh, what would you have done if you'd known?

28:12.500 --> 28:14.600
I don't know, we could've prepared him,

28:14.900 --> 28:18.100
we could've come up with a plan. As it is, you dropped it on him like a bomb.

28:18.500 --> 28:19.700
No wonder he's gone off and done something to himself.

28:20.100 --> 28:20.800
Are you serious?

28:20.900 --> 28:22.800
Yes! Yes, certainly I am.

28:22.900 --> 28:26.000
Do you ever stop and think that some of this could possibly be your fault?

28:26.300 --> 28:27.000
What? What?

28:27.800 --> 28:29.300
I was too permissive?

28:29.600 --> 28:33.027
No, no, no, no. I'm not talking about the liberal child-rearing sense, Mom.

28:33.900 --> 28:36.821
You blame everybody but yourself. You go out of your way, it's me,

28:36.871 --> 28:41.844
it's Kevin, it's Dad. Where were you in the picture? Do you ever think about that?

28:44.800 --> 28:46.962
I don't see any ocean out there.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.945
This is a terrible place to come to.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.925
Please! Please! Just one minute! One minute! It's for my little girl.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.450
Thank you so much. You're so kind.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.019
This must happen every night.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.700
Yeah, it's like "Sophie's Choice" in here. What do you need?

29:06.800 --> 29:11.127
I need a grass Hawaiian skirt for a hula.

29:12.300 --> 29:16.162
There's miriachis, which would be Mexico...

29:17.200 --> 29:19.275
Coconut cup? Closer...

29:21.600 --> 29:24.182
Ukelele...that's a good sign.

29:28.700 --> 29:29.471
Sorry.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.031
No, don't tell me that. Don't tell me that.

29:36.000 --> 29:36.977
Look, I'm sorry.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.119
They're weirdly popular.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.175
I can order you one.

29:43.300 --> 29:45.007
Yeah, yeah, why don't you do that?

29:45.100 --> 29:46.500
That'd be great, because then they'll get here, in what?

29:46.800 --> 29:50.787
9 weeks? Which is just in time for my daughter's recital, which is tomorrow.

29:52.400 --> 29:57.501
It's the minimum basic requirement that a party store always have Hawaii.

29:57.900 --> 29:58.800
Children have recitals

29:59.000 --> 30:00.700
and their parents, their mothers,

30:01.200 --> 30:03.500
can't do it all and we rely on our party store

30:03.600 --> 30:05.300
to keep up their end of the bargain

30:05.310 --> 30:09.610
so that our husbands and our children don't despise us when we come home empty-handed.

30:19.300 --> 30:20.422
I'll buy the lei.

30:25.400 --> 30:29.911
He's really wrecked. Usually we like to let this kind dry out for the night in lock-up.

30:30.300 --> 30:32.100
It reinforces the point, you know?

30:32.200 --> 30:32.600
Sure, sure,

30:32.800 --> 30:35.700
We have driven all the way from Los Angeles.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.100
There's a motel nearby. See you in the a.m.

30:38.300 --> 30:39.242
Bring coffee.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.630
All right, thank you. Thanks.

30:46.500 --> 30:47.496
Hi.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.905
I'm Justin's mother and this is his big sister, Kitty.

30:51.300 --> 30:54.400
Kitty Walker, "The Right Idea" and "Red, White and Blue."

30:56.200 --> 30:57.629
- You're kidding.
- No.

30:58.961 --> 30:59.579
You're her?

30:59.700 --> 31:01.945
Yeah, I am...me. Yes.

31:02.137 --> 31:03.282
I love your show.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.047
And we're not asking to be the exception here...

31:06.097 --> 31:07.481
Yes, we are.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.271
No, we're not.

31:09.600 --> 31:10.704
- Yes.
- No, no.

31:11.193 --> 31:12.801
- Yes, we are.
- No, we aren't.

31:14.700 --> 31:15.400
We are.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.105
All the girls came to get me, that's cool. Where's Sarah?

31:19.200 --> 31:23.614
- Kitty, he's sitting in the back with you.
- No, seriously, thanks for bringing the whole family. I mean, my day wasn't bad enough.

31:23.700 --> 31:24.669
They were worried about you.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.400
Oh, you had the do the right thing, right?

31:26.600 --> 31:28.900
Because Kevin always does the right thing, except sleep with women.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.900
Justin, could you shut up for ten seconds?

31:31.100 --> 31:32.600
If you didn't want my help, why'd you ask?

31:32.900 --> 31:36.059
'Cause I was in jail. I figured I should call the family lawyer. I mean, that's what you are, right?

31:36.109 --> 31:38.500
If your father could see this behavior!

31:38.700 --> 31:40.666
He'd what? Judge me? Tell me to get a job?

31:40.716 --> 31:42.597
He'd be so diappointed!

31:42.800 --> 31:46.419
Disappointed? Who the hell is he to be disappointed? He's the disappointment!

31:46.419 --> 31:47.167
What does that mean?

31:49.700 --> 31:50.388
Forget it.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.918
Your father loved you more than anything on Earth, you little spoiled brat!

31:56.018 --> 31:58.842
- You know what love means in this family? It means you suck!
- Get in the car!

31:58.873 --> 32:00.236
It means nothing you do will be good enough!

32:00.286 --> 32:01.922
Oh, you ungrateful child!

32:01.972 --> 32:05.036
You don't care about anyone but yourself! How did you get that way?

32:05.800 --> 32:08.260
You know what losing your father has done to me

32:08.400 --> 32:12.014
and yet you take your life and throw it around like it was worthless!

32:12.100 --> 32:12.975
Why?

32:13.025 --> 32:14.416
'Cause I wish I was dead.

32:15.300 --> 32:19.053
Don't you understand that!? I wish I'd died over there, Mom!

32:22.800 --> 32:29.198
Well, you didn't die and I'll be damned if I'll stand around and watch you kill yourself.

32:29.300 --> 32:30.538
Enough. Enough, Mom.

32:38.300 --> 32:40.266
God. You guys are so freaking serious.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.145
Hey, sorry.

32:51.145 --> 32:54.129
- Hey. So late. Any word from Justin?
- Yeah, he got arrested.

32:54.159 --> 32:55.723
Don't ask. He's fine.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.750
You almost missed grilled cheese night.

33:03.503 --> 33:05.011
I'm sorry, I've let us all down.

33:05.061 --> 33:07.425
They're out of grass skirts. They just sold the last one.

33:07.582 --> 33:08.343
These'll be great.

33:08.600 --> 33:14.314
Today is one of those days where everything you decide really, really, really matters.

33:14.441 --> 33:18.723
You....need something aside from grilled cheese.

33:28.300 --> 33:30.647
You need someone to say, "Congratulations!"

33:31.200 --> 33:31.950
What for?

33:32.200 --> 33:33.095
Your promotion.

33:34.000 --> 33:34.838
How did you know?

33:35.300 --> 33:36.585
A little bird on a wire.

33:43.500 --> 33:48.190
Oh...Hawaii. What am I gonna tell her?

33:50.300 --> 33:53.100
Hand...you need to see something great.

33:54.700 --> 33:55.300
What?

33:58.200 --> 34:00.818
Mom! Mommy! Mommy! Yay!

34:01.100 --> 34:02.232
Hey, Little Man.

34:04.759 --> 34:07.638
- Come on, come on, come on.
- What's going on here?

34:09.034 --> 34:10.458
Have a seat, my lady.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.036
We are ready.

34:20.699 --> 34:21.752
I got the last one.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.096
She made me teach her this.

35:17.100 --> 35:18.848
I hate it when you dominate the remote.

35:19.400 --> 35:22.400
I'm curious if gay porn has gotten to Oceanside yet.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.191
You know, I stay in a lot of hotels.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.510
This is research for me.

35:26.561 --> 35:30.346
Here we go, "Thirty-Something Inches," only $10.95. Shall we?

35:31.200 --> 35:32.603
Come on, give me that.

35:33.200 --> 35:36.599
- Wait! Is that Jonathan? It is Jonathan!
- Give it to me.

35:39.300 --> 35:42.830
He won't let me in. I just want to apologize.

35:44.800 --> 35:47.781
Why don't you stay here and I'll try and talk to him?

35:50.000 --> 35:50.854
Thanks.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.716
What the hell are we watching?

36:03.650 --> 36:04.989
Meerkats.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.500
These meerkats are wearing no clothes. Give me the clicker, now!

36:08.600 --> 36:10.882
OK, fine, but no cooking programs.

36:10.900 --> 36:11.690
Give me the clicker.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.203
She was just scared.

36:15.600 --> 36:16.925
I'm pretty frightening.

36:22.300 --> 36:23.616
He hated me, Kitty.

36:25.700 --> 36:26.943
Is that what you think?

36:30.000 --> 36:31.200
I could see it.

36:32.700 --> 36:36.035
Always the look of somebody who doesn't expect anything from you.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.733
Until all you do is disappoint him again and again,

36:42.300 --> 36:43.666
but he disappointed me, too.

36:45.100 --> 36:46.700
He loved you with all of his heart.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.000
They have to love you, it's their job.

36:49.150 --> 36:51.848
He just didn't know how to show it, to anyone.

36:52.000 --> 36:52.858
Well, he showed you.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.685
And yesterday, he showed me what he thought of me.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.060
Now he's dead...and I...

37:07.200 --> 37:11.002
You know, after you enlisted,

37:12.500 --> 37:14.149
he used to call me every day.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.508
You know, just to talk.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.185
And you know what he used to talk about?

37:23.400 --> 37:27.976
Justin stories. Great ones.

37:29.100 --> 37:34.681
He told me that out of all of his children, you were the only one who made him remember what being a kid was.

37:35.000 --> 37:41.636
You were the only one who could do that. Hmmm...he was so proud of you.

37:43.700 --> 37:48.419
C'mon, at age 60, you taught him to surf.

37:51.100 --> 37:52.473
He wasn't very good.

37:54.100 --> 37:59.419
Because of you, he was the only 70 year-old who appreciated "Death Cab...

37:59.684 --> 38:00.326
Curdle."

38:00.636 --> 38:02.097
Death Cab for Cutie.

38:04.381 --> 38:05.051
Close.

38:07.193 --> 38:09.555
Well, these are the things he would talk about when he called.

38:10.614 --> 38:12.052
I'd ask him how he was, and...

38:14.653 --> 38:16.253
these are the things he would say.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.000
You know what's nice about road trips?

38:25.700 --> 38:27.076
This is a road trip?

38:28.100 --> 38:33.138
They have these coffee shops that serve breakfast all night. You want?

38:36.800 --> 38:39.481
I want breakfast, all night.

38:58.100 --> 38:59.754
You wanted to know when the truck came in.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.357
How's it look?

39:18.300 --> 39:21.233
I had this little premonition some of it survived the journey...

39:21.635 --> 39:25.495
- I guess they didn't.
- Gladys, call the insurance.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.542
Hey, thanks for telling Joe.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.652
What are you talking about?

39:31.000 --> 39:32.846
He bought me champagne last night.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.570
Champagne was his idea.

39:35.100 --> 39:38.808
The back half of the truck is all perfect. We got, like, ten tons of good fruit back there.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.026
Thanks.

39:45.083 --> 39:47.745
I guess some things can be saved, and some can't.

39:48.500 --> 39:50.881
Tell me, Tommy, I need to know. What would you do?

39:52.500 --> 39:56.816
I didn't go to business school. All I got is my gut.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.638
Right now, I trust your gut more than my M.BA.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.270
Sarah, what is it?

40:15.700 --> 40:19.461
Saul, I love what our family has built here, and I wanna keep it alive,

40:19.900 --> 40:21.800
not just for us, but for all the people who work here,

40:22.000 --> 40:25.342
people who trusted this family, who trusted this company.

40:26.900 --> 40:28.882
I have the number here of a U.S. Attorney.

40:29.400 --> 40:35.111
I'll do it your way, six months. But, at the end of six months, if we haven't found our way out of this, I will call him.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.081
OK.

40:55.500 --> 40:58.345
I forgot...the Pacific.

40:59.500 --> 41:05.043
- No other ocean has so many colors.É«
- And look, you can see where the blues change.

41:05.093 --> 41:08.893
Black for you, white for you, black and white for you.

41:08.900 --> 41:09.869
One's fine.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.641
So, which route should we take back? The pretty or the fast?

41:13.691 --> 41:14.704
Fast!

41:15.800 --> 41:16.569
Pretty.
