We're three kilometers
off the coast, Vertigo.

00:32.128 --> 00:33.764
Keep it steady, Manta.

00:35.232 --> 00:37.000
I'll go rouse the rabble.

00:39.536 --> 00:41.005
Time to move.

00:41.972 --> 00:43.871
I'm good to go.

00:43.873 --> 00:46.340
Sponge and Julie, not so sure.

00:46.342 --> 00:48.742
Didn't Waller get you
a room last night?

00:48.744 --> 00:50.678
Don't be a hater, Floyd.

00:50.680 --> 00:54.215
Or are you just upset because
Waller didn't put you in charge.

00:54.217 --> 00:58.218
Yeah, why is that, Deadshot?
You usually run things.

00:58.220 --> 01:01.489
She asked me if her dress
made her look fat.

01:01.491 --> 01:03.691
She's gotten cranky
since she lost weight.

01:03.693 --> 01:06.795
Not our issue.
Is it, Daddy?

01:06.797 --> 01:11.932
We are just having our second
honeymoon anywhere we can.

01:38.928 --> 01:41.363
<i>More importantly,
he has leaked info</i>

17:06.255 --> 17:08.757
This time I'm searching
for something special.

17:09.458 --> 17:12.159
A lost card.

17:12.161 --> 17:15.494
Just call the bank, honey.
They'll get you a new one.

17:15.497 --> 17:17.766
What's it got?
Some kind of code?

17:18.700 --> 17:20.067
You might say.

17:20.069 --> 17:22.935
The last person who had it
was this man.

17:22.938 --> 17:25.675
He calls himself "Steel Maxim."

17:26.474 --> 17:28.641
Seriously?

17:28.643 --> 17:32.846
WALLER: <i>Late 20s, no distinguishing

17:32.848 --> 17:34.380

17:34.382 --> 17:37.516
We think he played a part
in the card's disappearance.

17:37.518 --> 17:40.021
But he's been hard
to track down.

17:40.023 --> 17:44.257

One more thing.

17:52.834 --> 17:54.734
This one's off the grid.

17:54.736 --> 17:57.937
You'll be dealing with me

17:57.939 --> 18:00.206
Deadshot will be
your team leader.

18:00.208 --> 18:04.378
I told you before, Waller, I don't
take orders from murderers.

18:04.380 --> 18:06.748
Not even if I said, "Please"?

18:08.685 --> 18:12.119
I answer to a higher authority.

18:12.121 --> 18:16.122
Higher than Waller? That
sounds like blasphemy, mate.

18:16.124 --> 18:19.259
I'd say maybe we should
take this outside.

18:19.261 --> 18:20.860
But that's up to her.

I'm not, but a girl's
gotta make some money.

01:13:05.411 --> 01:13:07.444
How do I put
this up for auction?

01:13:07.446 --> 01:13:10.247
Let Waller know
I'll give her the first bid.

01:13:10.249 --> 01:13:14.187
You tell that trick bitch
her ass is mine, you hear?

01:13:15.821 --> 01:13:18.922
Yeah, I think she got it.

01:13:18.924 --> 01:13:20.526
FROST: <i>So long, suckers.</i>

01:13:24.662 --> 01:13:26.098
(GRUNTING)

01:13:57.863 --> 01:13:59.462
Okay.

01:13:59.464 --> 01:14:01.867
Let's see how cold-blooded
you can get.

01:14:04.437 --> 01:14:07.003
Where's the car?
How close are they doing?

01:14:07.005 --> 01:14:09.308
Coopehead's got her,
but not for long.

01:14:12.812 --> 01:14:14.581
(STRAINING)

01:14:21.286 --> 01:14:23.055
(BEEPING)

01:14:24.389 --> 01:14:27.960
Waller, I'll see you in hell,
you dirty...

01:14:43.643 --> 01:14:45.011
(GAGS)

01:14:47.879 --> 01:14:49.414
Son of a bitch.

01:14:51.317 --> 01:14:53.920
How about helping
old Digger out here, eh?

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:56.289
Hey, hey. Whoa, hey.

01:14:56.921 --> 01:14:59.659
(GROANS)

01:15:00.893 --> 01:15:02.592
Two dead, Waller.

01:15:02.594 --> 01:15:05.397
WALLER: <i>I'll live with it.
Just get me the card.</i>

01:15:10.669 --> 01:15:13.106
All for a magic trick.

01:15:16.976 --> 01:15:19.510
Oh, ye of little faith.

01:15:19.512 --> 01:15:22.078
She'll blow you head off,
too, you know?

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.017
You're still not
getting it, love.

01:15:25.151 --> 01:15:26.316
I got the card.

01:15:26.318 --> 01:15:28.017
No onne's gonna kill me

01:15:28.019 --> 01:15:30.490
and waste a pass to the
pearly gates on this tosser.

01:15:48.808 --> 01:15:52.376
Benji! Oh, I thought
you were toast, mate.

01:15:52.378 --> 01:15:53.977
You okay?

01:15:53.979 --> 01:15:55.912
Where are the others?

01:15:55.914 --> 01:15:57.580
Oh, dead.

01:15:57.582 --> 01:16:00.751
They all killed each other
like cats in a bag.

01:16:00.753 --> 01:16:03.720
Savage, Zoom, all of them.

01:16:03.722 --> 01:16:05.189
What about the card?

01:16:05.191 --> 01:16:06.623
Well, mate, who knows?

01:16:06.625 --> 01:16:08.628
Waller's got to bring
a cleaning crew for that.

01:16:09.695 --> 01:16:10.996
Even for scum,

01:16:11.997 --> 01:16:14.431
you make a lousy liar.

01:16:14.433 --> 01:16:17.403
Watch it, kitten, you're not
the only one with claws.

01:16:23.442 --> 01:16:24.644
(GROANS)

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.117
I know you have it.
Give it to me!

01:16:34.052 --> 01:16:35.621
Screw you.

01:16:37.022 --> 01:16:39.222
Cowboy, Zoom just took off.

01:16:39.224 --> 01:16:42.258
- Oh, yeah.
- No, you stay.

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:43.763
Make sure they don't leave.

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.103

01:17:06.552 --> 01:17:10.223
Either your reflexes are back
or mine are short.

01:17:13.825 --> 01:17:15.128
Hmm.

01:17:16.495 --> 01:17:18.664
I'd say this more than
evens things.

01:17:19.531 --> 01:17:20.566
(GROANS)

01:17:23.068 --> 01:17:26.035
Drop the card and walk away.

01:17:26.037 --> 01:17:28.905
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?

01:17:28.907 --> 01:17:31.341
Death by a thousand cuts, Tiger.

01:17:31.343 --> 01:17:33.312
I'll have that card
by number ten.

01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.383
(GROANING)

01:17:44.022 --> 01:17:45.357

01:18:11.015 --> 01:18:12.585
Did I say ten?

01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:21.193
I underestimated.

01:18:36.909 --> 01:18:39.644
Do it. Save me the trouble.

01:18:40.612 --> 01:18:43.145
Maybe I'll just ward you too.

01:18:43.147 --> 01:18:48.784
I promise you, Deadshot, I'm
good for one last hit of speed.

01:18:48.786 --> 01:18:51.691
Any bullet you shoot,
I'll make sure it's lethal.

01:18:52.691 --> 01:18:54.160
So go ahead.

01:18:54.893 --> 01:18:56.628
Make my afterlife.

01:18:58.763 --> 01:19:00.265
(SCREAMS)

01:19:14.713 --> 01:19:16.715
Fuck my life.

(TIGER COUGHS)

01:19:46.711 --> 01:19:47.847
Kill me.

01:19:49.048 --> 01:19:51.047
We got him.

01:19:51.049 --> 01:19:52.918
We just crossed the finish line.

01:20:00.492 --> 01:20:02.195
I can't save you.

01:20:02.894 --> 01:20:04.296
I'm beyond

01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:06.698
salvation.

01:20:10.434 --> 01:20:12.905
(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:27.687
You didn't want her
to have it either.

01:20:29.655 --> 01:20:31.590
She doesn't deserve it.

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:35.660
What was her name? Your fiance?

01:20:37.662 --> 01:20:38.930
Miyoshi.

01:20:40.366 --> 01:20:41.834
Pretty name.

01:21:04.924 --> 01:21:07.660
Uh, I'll be damned.

01:21:11.796 --> 01:21:14.433
You better have that
freaking card.

01:21:21.205 --> 01:21:22.775
Not a scratch on it.

01:21:27.979 --> 01:21:30.549
Hmm, it feels cold.

01:21:31.383 --> 01:21:32.785
It's a cold world.

01:21:33.684 --> 01:21:35.918
This Zoom guy, he disappeared.

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:39.588
I looked around...
Oh, hi, Wally, how's Trix?

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:41.824
(SIGHS) She would live.

01:21:41.826 --> 01:21:43.694

01:21:43.696 --> 01:21:45.194
Are we good?

01:21:45.196 --> 01:21:48.967
No one's ever to speak
of this, Lawton, understood?

01:21:51.469 --> 01:21:53.338
I'll be seeing you, Waller.
