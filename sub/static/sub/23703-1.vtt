00:07.750 --> 00:09.748
<i>So many of us have fallen</i>

00:09.750 --> 00:12.292
<i>for the great lie.</i>

00:13.500 --> 00:15.042
<i>The myth of progress.</i>

00:16.458 --> 00:19.792
<i>The shiny idea that things
can only get better.</i>

00:22.583 --> 00:23.625
<i>The human condition.</i>

00:24.667 --> 00:26.123
<i>Humans themselves.</i>

00:26.125 --> 00:29.790
<i>Technology will perfect us
and the world around us.</i>

00:29.792 --> 00:30.917
<i>Won't it?</i>

00:35.417 --> 00:36.748
<i>But what if,</i>

00:36.750 --> 00:38.956
<i>what if progress
isn't inevitable?</i>

00:38.958 --> 00:40.875
<i>What if it doesn't get better?</i>

00:42.167 --> 00:43.873
<i>Computers.</i>

00:43.875 --> 00:47.081
<i>They got their start by calculating
the fastest way to kill.</i>

00:47.083 --> 00:48.873
<i>The nuclear dream?</i>

00:48.875 --> 00:50.417
<i>Well, that gave us the bomb.</i>

00:51.625 --> 00:53.290
<i>We think we're doing
the right thing.</i>

00:53.292 --> 00:56.123
<i>We think we learn from history.</i>

00:56.125 --> 00:58.000
<i>But as a great physicist
once said,</i>

00:59.208 --> 01:02.667
<i>"Science advances
one funeral at a time."</i>

01:04.500 --> 01:06.042
<i>Ain't that the fucking truth.</i>

02:49.167 --> 02:50.581
Hey.

02:50.583 --> 02:53.331
- Did you sleep at all?
- No, not really.

02:53.333 --> 02:54.998
But I'm okay I think.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.917
- You'll be great.
- Thanks.

03:06.042 --> 03:08.000
Thank you. Thank you.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.665
Can I say what a privilege

03:11.667 --> 03:13.415
it's been to lead this mission.

03:13.417 --> 03:16.040
And I couldn't have done it
without your help.

03:16.042 --> 03:18.206
Without your blood,
your sweat, and your tears.

03:18.208 --> 03:19.248
But we did it!

03:25.167 --> 03:27.206
We did it!

03:27.208 --> 03:29.373
Ladies and gentlemen,
the first digitized map

03:29.375 --> 03:30.873
of the human brain.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.208
Nice one, Theo.

03:44.167 --> 03:47.040
This is my digitized brain.

03:47.042 --> 03:48.956
All my memories, my fears,

03:48.958 --> 03:50.706
my hopes, my secrets,

03:50.708 --> 03:52.206
buried in there somewhere.

03:52.208 --> 03:54.081
But we want to extract them.

03:54.083 --> 03:55.581
Can we?

03:55.583 --> 03:57.040
We will.

03:57.042 --> 03:58.623
We will.

03:58.625 --> 03:59.667
Over here?

04:00.667 --> 04:04.248
This represents my first kiss.

04:07.125 --> 04:09.290
Over here, the day that
I lobbed the ball

04:09.292 --> 04:11.623
over the goalkeeper to score
from the half way line.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.706
And here.

04:17.708 --> 04:19.081
Is the day I held my daughter

04:19.083 --> 04:22.041
in my hands for the first time.

04:27.208 --> 04:29.750
But is it enough?

04:30.792 --> 04:31.917
Are we content with that?

04:33.333 --> 04:35.123
We always want to return.

04:35.125 --> 04:38.706
To experience those feelings
as if for the first time!

04:38.708 --> 04:40.542
But there's a price
to be paid for that.

04:41.833 --> 04:44.123
What is it that we give up in...

04:52.750 --> 04:53.875
What...

05:12.625 --> 05:14.206
Someone call
a bloody ambulance!

05:24.667 --> 05:25.792
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:29.292 --> 05:30.750
Don't!

05:32.333 --> 05:33.998
Hello?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.831
Yeah, no, I...

05:35.833 --> 05:36.917
What?

05:39.083 --> 05:40.083
Wait, what?

05:41.375 --> 05:42.917
Hale, what is it?

06:55.042 --> 06:56.042
Hey.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.292
Get in.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.081
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

07:33.083 --> 07:34.331
- Yeah.
- That's a good one.

07:34.333 --> 07:35.915
Yeah, you always need
someone to blame.

07:35.917 --> 07:39.540
Look, we both know
this is about you.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.873
- This is about me.
- Just...

07:41.875 --> 07:43.042
give me a heads up.

07:44.208 --> 07:45.498
Let me know
what I'm walking into.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.458
Shut up.

08:18.958 --> 08:20.248
Jesus.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.956
Holy shit.

08:21.958 --> 08:24.458
Boys,
this is Paul Avalon, MI5.

08:27.167 --> 08:28.167
Mary.

08:29.875 --> 08:32.373
Theo. Hale.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.706
I'm incredibly sorry
to throw you into this shitstorm

08:34.707 --> 08:35.707
during your time of grief.

08:37.207 --> 08:38.706
This is Max Kavinksy.

08:38.707 --> 08:40.498
He's responsible
for the terror attack.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.039
Actually,
he turned himself in

08:42.042 --> 08:43.956
before the first bomb went off.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.625
Seven days ago.

08:46.625 --> 08:47.915
<i>Marched into Stockwell station.</i>

08:47.917 --> 08:50.000
<i>Looked the copper
in the eyes and said...</i>

08:51.250 --> 08:54.083
So, I hid bombs
all over the city.

08:55.417 --> 08:58.917
And they'll detonate
at random intervals.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.083
It's time to take back
our future.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.040
Before Doc died,

09:09.042 --> 09:11.456
- he was working on memory diving.
- Bullshit.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.915
Brain mapping was the
breakthrough he was waiting for.

09:13.917 --> 09:15.456
You mapped a brain?

09:15.458 --> 09:17.081
Life didn't end
when you left the lab.

09:17.083 --> 09:18.998
He was on the verge
of figuring out the dives.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.040
In theory.

09:20.042 --> 09:21.498
Isn't it about time you two

09:21.500 --> 09:22.790
put your differences aside?

09:22.792 --> 09:24.206
We need you on this.

09:24.208 --> 09:25.998
If you guys can finish
what he started,

09:26.000 --> 09:27.248
you'll save god knows
how many lives.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.915
Hold on, hold on, kid.
Time out.

09:29.917 --> 09:33.415
So what you're saying
is that Doc was trying to...

09:33.417 --> 09:34.456
Get into his memory,

09:34.458 --> 09:35.998
to find the other bombs.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.292
Yes.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.750
I mean, that's gold.

09:47.417 --> 09:50.292
I hate to say it, but I think
Doc was blowing stacks.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.750
It can't be done.

09:54.292 --> 09:55.540
I'm out.

09:55.542 --> 09:57.125
Hale, please.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.917
You there, Doc?

10:03.375 --> 10:05.500
Now, where did that
slippery idiot go?

10:10.083 --> 10:11.417
Nobody there, huh?

10:54.417 --> 10:56.123
<i>Theo, it's me. I know...</i>

10:56.125 --> 10:57.498
<i>I know it's late.</i>

10:57.500 --> 10:58.956
<i>But listen.</i>

10:58.958 --> 11:02.123
<i>I've been reading this book
by this billionaire guy.</i>

11:02.125 --> 11:03.331
<i>Nev something.</i>

11:03.333 --> 11:05.456
<i>Nev Mason.</i>

11:05.458 --> 11:07.540
<i>This is a guy who's made
his fortune in tech,</i>

11:07.542 --> 11:10.165
<i>but he doesn't fall
for its tricks.</i>

11:10.167 --> 11:11.623
<i>Listen to this"</i>

11:11.625 --> 11:13.623
<i>"Humankind has won the earth.</i>

11:13.625 --> 11:15.581
<i>"Next stop, the digital realm.</i>

11:15.583 --> 11:18.290
<i>"But innovation cannot save us
from ourselves,</i>

11:18.292 --> 11:20.623
<i>"because it is not our savior.</i>

11:20.625 --> 11:22.956
<i>"Innovation is a test
of our humanity."</i>

11:22.958 --> 11:24.831
<i>Isn't that the truth.</i>

11:24.833 --> 11:26.831
<i>It's called</i> Life in Pixels:
A New Dawn.

11:26.833 --> 11:29.123
<i>It's a terrible title,
I know, but.</i>

11:29.125 --> 11:32.665
<i>Anyway, I'll let you know
if the rest is shit or not.</i>

11:32.667 --> 11:36.581
<i>Theo, um, I've been working
on something</i>

11:36.583 --> 11:39.581
<i>that I really want
to talk to you about</i>

11:39.583 --> 11:43.917
<i>when we get the chance
but, um, it's complicated.</i>

11:44.917 --> 11:46.583
<i>Anyway. Speak soon.</i>

12:11.208 --> 12:13.206
Lucy, have you seen
my battery pack for this?

12:13.208 --> 12:14.792
- Nope.
- I need my battery pack.

12:16.125 --> 12:17.333
Has anyone seen my battery pack?

12:18.708 --> 12:20.915
- I gave you my...
- Yeah, I left it over there.

12:20.917 --> 12:22.248
Tina?

12:22.250 --> 12:24.123
Carl, battery pack.
Have you seen my battery pack?

12:24.125 --> 12:26.665
- Nah.
- Dean, battery pack?

12:26.667 --> 12:28.248
- Nope.
- Rachel. Rachel!

12:28.250 --> 12:30.748
Now Rachel.
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.123
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.

12:32.125 --> 12:33.706
Have you seen my battery pack
for my headset?

12:33.708 --> 12:35.415
Rachel, quick! Yes!

12:35.417 --> 12:37.792
Rachel comes through.

12:40.333 --> 12:41.542
Sandra!

12:44.458 --> 12:45.498
Oh!

12:45.500 --> 12:47.042
I have the same earrings.

12:48.625 --> 12:51.665
The Cirrus 8.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.790
The Cirrus 8 is the first ever

12:57.792 --> 13:01.373
all-inclusive VR technology

13:01.375 --> 13:03.665
which taps into the
central nervous system.

13:03.667 --> 13:07.081
It tricks the senses,
sight, smell, taste,

13:07.083 --> 13:10.206
touch, and hearing
into experiencing

13:10.208 --> 13:12.623
the virtual world as real.

13:14.708 --> 13:17.873
And the magic is
in the mirror neuron chip

13:17.875 --> 13:19.458
and the micro-dosed DMT.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.248
DMT, that's a...

13:22.250 --> 13:23.623
Hallucinogenic.

13:23.625 --> 13:25.206
Naturally occurring.

13:25.208 --> 13:27.956
It primes the brain
to accept the digital reality.

13:27.958 --> 13:29.540
No, no thanks.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.040
No psychedelics
before noon for me, thanks.

13:32.042 --> 13:33.958
- Sandra.
- I'll give it a go.

13:37.792 --> 13:39.665
Theo Jones.
Dark Horse Combinator.

13:39.667 --> 13:40.915
I don't think I know you.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.708
Freshest incubator
on the block.

13:51.667 --> 13:52.750
Shall we?

13:59.417 --> 14:00.998
What are you doing here?

14:01.000 --> 14:01.958
Thank me later.

14:03.917 --> 14:05.000
Let's do it!

14:07.500 --> 14:09.125
<i>Connecting.</i>

14:10.917 --> 14:12.331
All right!

14:12.333 --> 14:15.248
So, if you want
to end the dive,

14:15.250 --> 14:16.915
exit through the door
at the red light.

14:16.917 --> 14:18.290
All right? Pretty simple.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.331
Got it?

14:19.333 --> 14:20.540
Got it.

14:20.542 --> 14:22.915
You can't affect
the landscapes,

14:22.917 --> 14:24.706
but the landscapes
can affect you.

14:24.708 --> 14:26.500
Don't play with fire.

14:33.792 --> 14:35.873
All right. You ready?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.123
Loving looking
in your angel eyes.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.958
Er, gentlemen,
shall we commence?

14:42.958 --> 14:44.040
Close your eyes.

14:44.042 --> 14:45.417
Count backwards from five.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.665
When you open them,
you'll be in.

14:48.667 --> 14:49.708
Got it.

14:58.333 --> 15:04.208
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

15:56.792 --> 15:58.667
I mean, you really have
to try it for yourself.

16:49.583 --> 16:50.750
Ahh!

17:21.833 --> 17:23.415
<i>Disconnected.</i>

17:30.667 --> 17:32.373
Dude.

17:32.375 --> 17:33.625
That is legend.

17:36.125 --> 17:37.290
How did you get the code

17:37.292 --> 17:39.206
to mirror the ceiling
in real time?

17:39.208 --> 17:41.373
Oh, what the hell,
it's noon somewhere.

17:41.375 --> 17:43.748
- Let me try it.
- Even the fire burns...

17:43.750 --> 17:45.040
Wait, what?

17:45.042 --> 17:47.748
What, the fire, no, hang on.
You burned yourself?

17:47.750 --> 17:49.248
So hang on, you hurt yourself?

17:49.250 --> 17:51.123
The brain perceives pain
as it would.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.706
How are you going
to get around that drawback?

17:52.708 --> 17:54.123
It's not a drawback.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.123
It's a feature.
It's a real life system.

17:56.125 --> 17:58.165
That's what I'm giving you.
There's no pleasure without pain.

17:58.167 --> 18:00.581
There's no money
in unsafe virtual worlds.

18:00.583 --> 18:01.831
Yes.

18:01.833 --> 18:03.498
Sandra, what I'm giving you

18:03.500 --> 18:06.248
is a real sensory modality

18:06.250 --> 18:08.623
that other tech companies
aren't even going near!

18:08.625 --> 18:10.748
I don't wanna be open
for any kind of litigation.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.498
Build me a restart button
and then I...

18:12.500 --> 18:14.331
I'm not selling you
video games.

18:14.333 --> 18:15.998
Just think.
The potential applications...

18:16.000 --> 18:17.792
You don't need to speak for me.
It speaks for itself!

18:19.417 --> 18:23.165
Listen, thank you so much for
a really lively presentation,

18:23.167 --> 18:25.415
but it's a pass, I'm sorry.

18:25.417 --> 18:27.290
It's all yours, Mr. Jones.

18:27.292 --> 18:28.417
Thank you.

18:29.958 --> 18:32.208
Thank you, Sandra!

18:35.833 --> 18:37.373
Not the first.

18:37.375 --> 18:38.373
Won't be the last.

18:38.375 --> 18:39.415
No vision.

18:39.417 --> 18:40.873
Screw the suit.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.583
Technically,
aren't you a suit?

18:45.667 --> 18:46.750
Hale.

18:48.750 --> 18:49.708
Hey.

18:51.792 --> 18:52.792
Hale!

18:55.292 --> 18:56.542
I brought you a present.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.833
Are you bringing drugs
into my establishment?

19:06.208 --> 19:07.375
Nah, not me.

19:09.667 --> 19:11.165
Hmm?

19:11.167 --> 19:12.792
Alaskan Thunderfunk.

19:14.958 --> 19:16.042
Old times' sake?

19:19.042 --> 19:20.458
Step into my office.

19:29.583 --> 19:31.375
Ohh!

19:33.583 --> 19:37.956
Man, I was having a pint with
the Doc like two days ago.

19:37.958 --> 19:39.000
You were talking again?

19:41.083 --> 19:42.750
Yeah, we were talking again.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.373
He hasn't been himself.

19:46.375 --> 19:48.081
Exer squeezed our funding.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.417
Lab's been stressful.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.915
There's gotta be
something more than this.

19:54.917 --> 19:57.873
I don't know,
some gated place,

19:57.875 --> 19:59.748
the only gatekeeper
being a mirror.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.790
If you can stand
the sorry sight of yourself

20:01.792 --> 20:03.373
then you're free to enter.

20:03.375 --> 20:05.373
Well, if the cloud is solved
before that comes a-knocking,

20:05.375 --> 20:07.956
then it's basically choose
your own adventure, right?

20:07.958 --> 20:10.415
Yeah, I'm telling you,
there's something's not right

20:10.417 --> 20:11.917
about all of this.

20:13.208 --> 20:15.706
Myoclonic epilepsy.

20:15.708 --> 20:21.415
It's, you know,
it's unpredictable.

20:21.417 --> 20:23.956
The inescapable feeling
of being watched.

20:23.958 --> 20:27.998
It corrupts
the true self, always.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.792
Truth burns.

20:30.875 --> 20:31.917
Right.

20:33.125 --> 20:35.956
Ben goes bye-bye
under the bright lights

20:35.958 --> 20:38.958
and 24 hours later
we're hunting a Nazi.

20:40.667 --> 20:42.083
I don't buy it.

20:43.542 --> 20:44.583
Well.

20:46.458 --> 20:47.833
We've got his brain map.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.040
His research
on the memory dives?

20:58.042 --> 20:59.915
The maths adds up.

20:59.917 --> 21:01.206
He cracked it.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.248
Don't get me wrong,
there's pieces missing,

21:03.250 --> 21:06.915
but there's a chance
that we could sort this.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.665
Then sort it.

21:08.667 --> 21:09.915
Sort, sort, sort, sort, sort.

21:09.917 --> 21:11.290
I can't go lone wolf.

21:11.292 --> 21:12.331
Why not?

21:12.333 --> 21:14.206
I got the software,

21:14.208 --> 21:16.917
but you have the hardware.

21:17.917 --> 21:18.915
Cirrus 8?

21:18.917 --> 21:21.748
Man, that is some serious sex.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.123
Next level.

21:23.125 --> 21:24.167
God level.

21:25.167 --> 21:26.165
God level.

21:26.167 --> 21:28.206
God level.

21:28.208 --> 21:30.831
If we can reprogram your chip
to process memory data

21:30.833 --> 21:33.081
from a brain map
as virtual space,

21:33.083 --> 21:35.831
then maybe we can dive
into Doc's memories.

21:35.833 --> 21:37.373
Dive nice and deep.

21:37.375 --> 21:41.748
Doc's and Max's.

21:41.750 --> 21:44.748
I don't play well with the law birds.

21:44.750 --> 21:47.748
Government greysuits
climbing my walls.

21:47.750 --> 21:50.750
I want nothing to do with
London's Next Top Terrorist.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.917
Exer could fund
this whole operation.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.292
Play hide and seek
with the cog army.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.042
Nah, sorry.
It's not my style, man.

22:07.750 --> 22:10.458
I may look good
in a suit, but I'm no cog.

22:12.583 --> 22:14.831
I've opened every door
at Wolff for myself.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.667
And for once,
I'm not sorry about that.

22:27.958 --> 22:30.206
I legit just blacked out
the last 30 seconds.

22:30.208 --> 22:31.542
What were we talking about?

22:52.625 --> 22:55.042
I said you built
something remarkable here.

22:57.333 --> 22:58.375
Congratulations.

23:03.042 --> 23:04.125
Doc's dive notes.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.290
<i>Is Theo planting the flag</i>

23:08.292 --> 23:10.748
<i>on this hush-hush
little project you're doing?</i>

23:10.750 --> 23:13.081
<i>You know,
it really kills me</i>

23:13.083 --> 23:14.540
<i>that you two are...</i>

23:14.542 --> 23:16.706
<i>Why don't you just call him up?</i>

23:16.708 --> 23:17.917
<i>What's behind your gates?</i>

23:18.917 --> 23:20.998
I don't know.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.917
Maybe your return
to the true self.

23:24.458 --> 23:25.583
Heaven for some.

23:27.958 --> 23:29.250
Hell for others.

24:00.542 --> 24:02.625
It's okay, it's okay.

24:07.833 --> 24:09.248
Shh.

24:09.250 --> 24:10.581
It's okay.

24:10.583 --> 24:11.792
You dreaming again?

24:26.375 --> 24:27.792
What were you dreaming about?

24:31.833 --> 24:33.958
I don't know. It was just so...

24:38.500 --> 24:39.500
Mm-hmm?

24:40.625 --> 24:41.958
Vivid.

24:45.958 --> 24:47.083
Tell me.

24:51.583 --> 24:55.375
They want me to go work on
one of Doc's leftover projects.

24:56.583 --> 24:57.667
Who?

25:01.542 --> 25:02.792
Mary.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.042
Theo.

25:14.958 --> 25:16.875
What are you guys working on?

25:19.708 --> 25:21.456
They want to dive.

25:21.458 --> 25:22.500
Dive?

25:23.583 --> 25:24.790
Yeah.

25:24.792 --> 25:26.331
No, you're not going to dive.

25:26.333 --> 25:28.081
- Why not?
- No!

25:28.083 --> 25:30.790
We tried everything,
from hypnosis to LSD,

25:30.792 --> 25:32.248
to what was the name again?

25:32.250 --> 25:34.456
- Lucid dreaming.
- Yeah! And the other thing.

25:34.458 --> 25:36.373
- Astral projection.
- Exactly.

25:36.375 --> 25:38.331
I know you want to know
what happened to your parents

25:38.333 --> 25:41.292
but sometimes it's best
to let go, you know?

26:08.708 --> 26:10.123
Oh, my God.

26:10.125 --> 26:12.792
Hale!

26:48.250 --> 26:49.500
<i>Hey. Theo, it's Hale.</i>

26:51.042 --> 26:53.500
<i>This is getting out of control.
Let's meet at our spot.</i>

26:54.500 --> 26:55.500
<i>Now.</i>

27:11.625 --> 27:13.623
<i>At least
17 have been killed</i>

27:13.625 --> 27:16.665
<i>and many more injured
after another explosive device</i>

27:16.667 --> 27:18.623
<i>went off in the UK
this morning.</i>

27:18.625 --> 27:21.498
<i>This time at a
South London mosque.</i>

27:21.500 --> 27:23.248
<i>Authorities are refusing
to comment</i>

27:23.250 --> 27:25.373
<i>on whether this is
a copycat attack</i>

27:25.375 --> 27:27.415
<i>or if there's any evidence
that it could be related</i>

27:27.417 --> 27:29.623
<i>to the two attacks
that have shocked London</i>

27:29.625 --> 27:31.206
<i>over the past week.</i>

27:31.208 --> 27:33.498
<i>The police are not releasing
a statement at this time</i>

27:33.500 --> 27:36.081
<i>but are appealing for anyone
with any information</i>

27:36.083 --> 27:37.831
<i>to come forward.</i>

27:37.833 --> 27:41.000
<i>We'll be back in a moment with
the rest of the day's news.</i>

27:43.417 --> 27:45.250
My gran used to take me there.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.125
We doing this?

28:34.500 --> 28:36.206
Slaves!

28:36.208 --> 28:37.956
Couch, up there, now.

28:37.958 --> 28:39.375
It's gonna be a long night.
Let's do this.

28:45.292 --> 28:46.706
<i>The world mourns</i>

28:46.708 --> 28:48.665
<i>for recent victims
of terror attacks.</i>

28:48.667 --> 28:51.623
<i>Candlelight vigils are shown
from New York to Warsaw</i>

28:51.625 --> 28:53.873
<i>as the community shows
its solidarity</i>

28:53.875 --> 28:55.042
<i>with the people of London.</i>

28:56.333 --> 28:57.873
<i>Police refuse
to release the names</i>

28:57.875 --> 28:59.373
<i>of any potential suspects</i>

28:59.375 --> 29:01.748
<i>and have raised
the attack level to critical.</i>

29:01.750 --> 29:03.415
<i>Leaving many people to believe</i>

29:03.417 --> 29:05.540
<i>that more attacks are imminent.</i>

29:05.542 --> 29:07.331
Let me in, let me in.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.706
Test one.

29:15.708 --> 29:17.706
God, I hope this works.

29:17.708 --> 29:19.081
Come on!

29:19.083 --> 29:20.790
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

29:20.792 --> 29:23.498
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

29:25.000 --> 29:26.792
Here we go! Yes!

29:32.292 --> 29:33.873
Yeah, nothing.

29:33.875 --> 29:34.792
Nothing!

29:36.708 --> 29:37.748
Number seven.

29:37.750 --> 29:38.792
DMT won't hold.

29:48.583 --> 29:49.583
Test 25.

29:57.542 --> 29:59.000
Test 32.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.123
Fuck!

31:13.958 --> 31:15.623
Wait.

31:15.625 --> 31:16.583
Dynamite?

31:18.542 --> 31:21.540
We're effectively building
a biofeedback loop. Right?

31:21.542 --> 31:24.373
Brain-machine interface.

31:24.375 --> 31:26.956
Which is supposed to be
a two way street.

31:26.958 --> 31:29.458
Except right now, it's not.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.748
Information flows
in one direction.

31:32.750 --> 31:34.998
Map to user.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.748
We have to open the loop.

31:36.750 --> 31:39.873
Establish a dialogue
with the memories. How?

31:39.875 --> 31:41.040
- How?
- How?

31:41.042 --> 31:42.748
- How?
- How?

31:42.750 --> 31:43.915
Quickest or cleanest?

31:43.917 --> 31:45.123
Huh?

31:45.125 --> 31:46.750
Quickest or cleanest?

31:48.208 --> 31:49.500
I got a gun to my head.

31:55.333 --> 31:58.333
Feed the user's brain map
into the target map.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.831
Which allows the user's brain

32:05.833 --> 32:08.498
to fill the holes
in the memories.

32:08.500 --> 32:09.831
- That's it.
- Yes!

32:09.833 --> 32:12.500
Fake the loop until
we can update the chip.

32:16.125 --> 32:17.206
Genius!

32:41.250 --> 32:42.208
Who's first?

32:43.875 --> 32:45.748
Right, let's see
what rotten fruit is stuck

32:45.750 --> 32:47.583
all the way
inside that mind of yours.

33:12.250 --> 33:15.540
Morning, everyone,
thanks for coming.

33:15.542 --> 33:16.623
Okay.

33:16.625 --> 33:19.998
Test 67. 68.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.706
Got that.

33:21.708 --> 33:27.623
Right, uh, his mind acts
as the remote, okay.

33:27.625 --> 33:30.081
He needs to concentrate
on what he wants to see

33:30.083 --> 33:32.915
in order to bring up related
memories in the brain map.

33:32.917 --> 33:36.206
And those memories,
theoretically,

33:36.208 --> 33:38.000
should be recreated
in the simulation.

33:39.917 --> 33:40.875
We think.

33:43.875 --> 33:45.581
Blue doors take us deeper.

33:45.583 --> 33:46.956
They skip to the next memory.

33:46.958 --> 33:49.165
Otherwise, red doors are
still our trusty exits.

33:49.167 --> 33:51.331
We'll be tracking audio
and vitals during the dive,

33:51.333 --> 33:52.623
but that's it.

33:52.625 --> 33:54.873
The rest is an unknown.

33:54.875 --> 33:57.081
This is uncharted territory,
Fluxxxers.

33:57.083 --> 33:58.290
Question.

33:58.292 --> 33:59.540
Isn't this dangerous?

33:59.542 --> 34:00.792
Yeah.

34:02.292 --> 34:03.833
It's really fucking dangerous.

34:07.333 --> 34:08.956
- Okay, you set?
- Okay.

34:08.958 --> 34:10.375
<i>Connecting.</i>

34:59.167 --> 35:01.623
You know Noddy?

35:01.625 --> 35:04.873
You know that little character?

35:04.875 --> 35:06.081
<i>Never mind.</i>

35:06.083 --> 35:07.750
Holy shit. It's working.

35:08.750 --> 35:09.748
<i>You see,</i>

35:09.750 --> 35:11.081
we have this...

35:11.083 --> 35:16.456
we have this idea that
knowledge is freedom!

35:16.458 --> 35:20.998
And that science will illuminate

35:21.000 --> 35:24.290
the complexity of the world.

35:24.292 --> 35:26.498
But what happens
if that's not true?

35:26.500 --> 35:29.373
We will explore
the geographical frontiers.

35:29.375 --> 35:32.456
People like, you know,
Columbus, Marco Polo,

35:32.458 --> 35:36.373
<i>none of that would've
been possible without technology.</i>

35:36.375 --> 35:38.540
For example.

35:38.542 --> 35:42.040
When Christopher Columbus set
out to discover the new world,

35:42.042 --> 35:45.873
he didn't... he had no idea
where he was going.

35:45.875 --> 35:48.581
But more importantly,
when he got there,

35:48.583 --> 35:50.081
he didn't know where he was.

35:50.083 --> 35:52.540
And when he came back,
he didn't know where he'd been.

35:52.542 --> 35:56.123
He's an example
of what we imagine

35:56.125 --> 35:58.540
is the frontier of knowing.

35:58.542 --> 36:00.206
We think it's connection,
but it's not.

36:00.208 --> 36:01.290
It's pretend.

36:01.292 --> 36:02.748
Because we are
still human.

36:02.750 --> 36:05.581
We are opening Pandora's box.
We're like monsters.

36:05.583 --> 36:09.331
No, no, we're like the man
who created the monster.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.540
We don't know
what we're going to create.

36:12.542 --> 36:14.165
We could create
our own destruction.

36:14.167 --> 36:16.748
Listen, what you've
designed, it's holistic.

36:16.750 --> 36:19.083
It's science,
but it's holistic.

36:22.750 --> 36:24.706
Desire to be God!

36:34.208 --> 36:35.292
Guys, get out the way!

36:39.167 --> 36:40.083
Hale?

36:41.167 --> 36:43.123
Hale, can you hear me?

36:43.125 --> 36:44.706
Hale!

36:46.000 --> 36:48.081
- Tell me.
- Hey, calm down.

36:48.083 --> 36:49.540
No, I'm not calming down.

36:49.542 --> 36:50.956
I'm coming every morning.

36:50.958 --> 36:52.373
If I don't sleep
I save two hours.

36:52.375 --> 36:53.873
We're working together.

36:53.875 --> 36:55.540
And you have to tell me
exactly what's going on.

36:55.542 --> 36:57.248
I didn't know, I mean how...

36:57.250 --> 36:59.373
- How was I supposed...
- What? Of course you knew.

36:59.375 --> 37:01.415
You knew.
Look at me in the eyes.

37:01.417 --> 37:02.665
Listen, I'm on your side
in this.

37:02.667 --> 37:03.956
You can find anyone you want,

37:03.958 --> 37:05.790
but I'm not pushing the button.

37:05.792 --> 37:06.833
You're not listening to me.

37:08.417 --> 37:09.748
- Why are you lying?
- I had no idea...

37:09.750 --> 37:10.790
Why are you lying?

37:10.792 --> 37:11.956
- Why...
- Why are you lying?

37:11.958 --> 37:13.206
Was it such
a bad assumption to make

37:13.208 --> 37:14.456
that he would tell you?

37:14.458 --> 37:15.500
- No.
- Sorry?

37:18.042 --> 37:19.208
A terrorist?

37:21.208 --> 37:22.667
That's the project?

37:24.833 --> 37:27.165
No, hey, listen to me.

37:27.167 --> 37:28.748
You don't understand something.

37:28.750 --> 37:30.081
I want to be a part of it.

37:30.083 --> 37:31.790
Look at me.

37:31.792 --> 37:33.081
I'm not mad.

37:33.083 --> 37:34.790
I mean, if there's a way
to stop this monster,

37:34.792 --> 37:36.125
I'm in, okay.

37:37.333 --> 37:38.708
Do you understand?

37:39.917 --> 37:41.042
Hmm.

37:43.125 --> 37:45.417
What happened up there?
Your heart rate spiked.

37:47.833 --> 37:50.498
It must have been some sort
of shock to the system.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.873
Overload or something.

37:52.875 --> 37:56.290
Okay, uh, I think we need
to add a second Cirrus.

37:56.292 --> 37:58.456
If we can't force eject,
we need to wing-man each other.

37:58.458 --> 38:00.498
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah.

38:00.500 --> 38:01.750
How was it?

38:05.667 --> 38:06.667
Yeah?

38:08.000 --> 38:09.167
It was...

38:13.542 --> 38:15.375
like future jazz.

38:23.917 --> 38:25.250
I'll see you guys
in the morning.

38:26.542 --> 38:27.956
Look after him.

38:27.958 --> 38:30.042
We don't yet know
the full effects of the dive.

39:28.292 --> 39:30.665
<i>At least
17 have been killed</i>

39:30.667 --> 39:34.165
<i>and many more injured
after another explosive device</i>

39:34.167 --> 39:36.042
<i>went off in the UK
this morning.</i>

39:38.583 --> 39:40.831
<i>Authorities
are refusing to comment</i>

39:40.833 --> 39:43.165
<i>on whether this is
a copycat attack</i>

39:43.167 --> 39:44.998
<i>or if there's any evidence
that it could be related</i>

39:45.000 --> 39:46.456
<i>to the two attacks
that have shocked London</i>

39:46.458 --> 39:47.708
<i>over the past week.</i>

39:58.875 --> 40:00.706
Just back away now.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.248
All right, petal?

40:21.250 --> 40:22.208
I can gag him.

40:23.958 --> 40:25.083
Oh, no.

40:41.958 --> 40:42.958
I'm Max.

40:45.042 --> 40:46.208
So I've heard.

40:52.417 --> 40:53.458
So you know me.

40:54.458 --> 40:55.708
Fan of my work?

40:57.667 --> 40:59.250
I'd be quite upset
if you didn't.

41:00.333 --> 41:02.917
I put in a lot of work
to get here.

41:05.708 --> 41:06.792
What's your name?

41:14.542 --> 41:15.542
I think.

41:17.375 --> 41:21.833
I think I'll call you
Black Magic.

41:23.958 --> 41:25.208
Yeah, I quite like that.

41:26.625 --> 41:27.583
Thoughts?

41:28.958 --> 41:30.000
No?

41:31.083 --> 41:32.250
No?

41:33.375 --> 41:35.083
Well, it's settled then.

41:40.542 --> 41:42.831
You've got some
fancy tools there.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.500
Have you any idea
how to use them?

41:45.583 --> 41:46.665
I designed them.

41:46.667 --> 41:50.290
Oh, well, look at you, eh?

41:50.292 --> 41:52.125
I love it.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.331
Rags to riches, eh?

41:56.333 --> 41:59.081
Plucked off the streets
and shoehorned into a job

41:59.083 --> 42:00.790
you didn't deserve.

42:00.792 --> 42:02.665
Too bad about
the worthy white man

42:02.667 --> 42:04.125
whose place you took, huh?

42:08.042 --> 42:12.790
You know,
I don't hate your kind.

42:16.958 --> 42:18.375
My kind?

42:21.083 --> 42:22.623
Jews.

42:22.625 --> 42:23.792
Queers.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.167
Niggers.

42:28.792 --> 42:33.500
Your people.

42:35.500 --> 42:39.040
Everyone's got someone
looking out for them.

42:39.042 --> 42:44.540
But who is securing
the existence of my blood

42:44.542 --> 42:47.040
and a future
for proud white children?

42:47.042 --> 42:48.167
Who's doing that?

42:52.375 --> 42:54.331
It's me!

42:54.333 --> 42:55.500
I am!

43:00.333 --> 43:01.708
So do your worst.

43:03.542 --> 43:05.040
Make me a martyr.

43:05.042 --> 43:07.331
- A martyr?
- Hmm.

43:07.333 --> 43:09.708
- Make them remember me.
- Max.

43:10.958 --> 43:12.748
Has anyone explained to you

43:12.750 --> 43:14.331
what's going
to happen here today?

43:14.333 --> 43:15.665
No.

43:15.667 --> 43:18.165
Everyone's been so rude
to me since I got here.

43:18.167 --> 43:20.208
- I bet. Poor you.
- Hmm.

43:21.375 --> 43:22.500
Well, allow me.

43:24.167 --> 43:27.083
I'm gonna make a copy
of your brain.

43:28.750 --> 43:31.873
Then I'm gonna rummage around
in all your memories.

43:31.875 --> 43:34.498
Poke my nose
in every little dark corner

43:34.500 --> 43:36.333
in that twisted little mind
of yours

43:37.542 --> 43:40.373
and find every last bomb
you planted.

43:43.417 --> 43:44.875
That's not possible.

43:46.792 --> 43:48.290
You're a dirty liar.

43:50.792 --> 43:52.042
Black magic.

43:58.458 --> 44:02.042
No one out there
knows your name, Max.

44:03.542 --> 44:05.083
Mine's Theo.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.125
Bet you won't forget that.

44:15.333 --> 44:17.042
Yeah, well,
you better be quick.

44:21.375 --> 44:23.417
You never know when
the next bomb might go off.

44:42.750 --> 44:45.623
What this is
is time-released dosage, DMT.

44:45.625 --> 44:48.875
It allows us to dive deeper,
for longer.

44:54.125 --> 44:55.998
Are you sure about this?

44:56.000 --> 44:58.250
Yeah, I promise.

45:16.292 --> 45:17.417
<i>Connected.</i>

45:29.167 --> 45:30.958
<i>Connected.</i>

45:44.917 --> 45:46.125
Oh, my God!

45:47.542 --> 45:48.790
It's like he's really here!

45:48.792 --> 45:50.123
Yeah.

45:50.125 --> 45:51.540
It's crazy.

45:54.792 --> 45:56.083
It's four in the morning.

45:58.042 --> 45:59.665
Okay.

45:59.667 --> 46:02.040
Who is behind Exer?

46:02.042 --> 46:06.623
According to these documents,
it's the CIA.

46:06.625 --> 46:09.333
The fucking CIA!

46:10.667 --> 46:13.498
- What?
- You know what that means?

46:13.500 --> 46:15.081
It means I've been working
on a weapon

46:15.083 --> 46:18.540
for the last two years,
and I had no idea.

46:18.542 --> 46:19.956
Do you understand?

46:19.958 --> 46:22.708
They can access anybody's mind,
anywhere, anytime.

46:24.458 --> 46:26.292
They will not have it!

46:52.792 --> 46:55.375
I can't even imagine
the pressure you boys are under.

46:59.333 --> 47:01.417
Mary, we got it to work.

47:04.792 --> 47:05.958
We can dive.

47:10.958 --> 47:12.083
You just started.

47:24.333 --> 47:26.581
Are you positive?

47:26.583 --> 47:27.875
What the...

47:32.333 --> 47:33.625
Jesus!

47:35.167 --> 47:37.167
Theo! Theo, wait!

47:38.333 --> 47:39.540
Stop.

47:39.542 --> 47:40.665
Theo, stop!

47:42.833 --> 47:44.333
It's okay.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.248
Jesus Christ, you shot him!

47:48.250 --> 47:49.250
Fuck!

47:51.083 --> 47:52.415
Exer played us all.

47:52.417 --> 47:53.500
Exer?

47:54.583 --> 47:55.998
Exer!

47:56.000 --> 47:59.290
We've been collaborating
with you for 15 years.

47:59.292 --> 48:01.290
15 years. With you!

48:01.292 --> 48:02.873
Exer's not who we thought
they were.

48:02.875 --> 48:04.748
They couldn't care less
about the bombs.

48:04.750 --> 48:06.498
They want the cloud algorithm.

48:06.500 --> 48:07.998
They need you to perfect
the dive tech

48:08.000 --> 48:10.540
so they can extract it
from Doc's memories.

48:10.542 --> 48:11.706
Just lay low.

48:11.708 --> 48:12.750
Don't talk to anyone.

48:13.792 --> 48:15.581
We will find a way
to protect you.

48:15.583 --> 48:16.998
Just go.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.500
Theo, go!

48:29.333 --> 48:31.000
What's going on? Here.

48:45.250 --> 48:47.208
Why do I still remember!

48:48.667 --> 48:51.456
Why the hell do I
still remember!

48:51.458 --> 48:52.917
What are you doing?

49:24.250 --> 49:26.123
<i>Disconnected.</i>

49:28.958 --> 49:30.206
<i>Disconnected.</i>

49:30.208 --> 49:31.706
Doc never wanted to stop Max.

49:31.708 --> 49:33.748
Doc was trying
to erase his memory.

49:33.750 --> 49:35.123
Is that what killed him?

49:35.125 --> 49:36.748
That's what killed him.
It wasn't the epilepsy.

49:36.750 --> 49:38.331
He did it to himself.

49:38.333 --> 49:40.915
That's what it was.

49:40.917 --> 49:42.415
There's something wrong
with the dive tech.

49:42.417 --> 49:43.748
I know, I know.

49:43.750 --> 49:45.748
Our memories, they were
leaking into the simulation.

49:45.750 --> 49:46.833
I know.

49:48.917 --> 49:50.290
Hey.

49:50.292 --> 49:55.125
I just watched
Mary shoot Alfie.

49:56.292 --> 49:57.706
- What?
- Doc's driver!

49:57.708 --> 49:59.958
- What do you mean she...
- She just blew his brains out.

50:03.083 --> 50:05.581
Exer is after
the cloud algorithm.

50:05.583 --> 50:06.667
They think it's in his memories.

50:07.833 --> 50:08.915
Oh, my God, is it?

50:08.917 --> 50:10.581
I don't know.

50:10.583 --> 50:13.206
Okay. I mean,
this is some serious

50:13.208 --> 50:16.206
deluxe gaslighting
Sophie's Choice sort of shit.

50:16.208 --> 50:18.290
No, it's not. It's not.

50:18.292 --> 50:20.040
We have the dive tech.

50:20.042 --> 50:21.456
We have Max's memories. Right?

50:21.458 --> 50:23.748
So until someone's breaking
down our front door,

50:23.750 --> 50:26.873
- we keep going.
- If we give the locations of the bombs,

50:26.875 --> 50:28.790
they will know we can dive.

50:28.792 --> 50:30.373
What do you mean they'll know?
Who's they?

50:30.375 --> 50:32.498
We'll win the battle,
but we'll lose the war.

50:32.500 --> 50:34.915
- What war? What are you talking about?
- The war? What war?

50:34.917 --> 50:36.998
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean what war?

50:37.000 --> 50:39.748
You just saw Mary kill a man.

50:39.750 --> 50:41.373
Probably CIA.

50:41.375 --> 50:42.873
I need you
thinking clearly, okay?

50:42.875 --> 50:46.206
We don't need you breaking out
into this conspiracy...

50:47.292 --> 50:50.498
I am trying to prevent us

50:50.500 --> 50:51.873
from falling into some sort

50:51.875 --> 50:54.581
of Orwellian nightmare...

50:54.583 --> 50:55.750
There is no choice!

50:56.750 --> 50:58.290
We have to trust Mary.

50:58.292 --> 51:00.665
And stop Max
while there's still time.

51:00.667 --> 51:02.373
Thank you.

51:02.375 --> 51:03.417
Fuck!

51:29.542 --> 51:32.042
Welcome, gentlemen,
old and new.

51:33.083 --> 51:35.831
Those old, good to see you.

51:35.833 --> 51:38.000
Those new, welcome aboard.

51:40.542 --> 51:42.790
Now why have we met today?

51:42.792 --> 51:45.667
Well, last night,
I read an article.

51:46.833 --> 51:48.498
Lugenpresse clickbait.

51:50.458 --> 51:54.706
Some tech conglomerate
gloating about

51:54.708 --> 51:58.167
how many less whites they hired!

51:59.583 --> 52:01.833
Well, who's mourning
these crimes against us?

52:03.583 --> 52:04.583
No one.

52:05.958 --> 52:09.040
Because this is what they want.

52:09.042 --> 52:10.458
- Yes.
- That's right.

52:11.625 --> 52:13.500
We used to be conquerors.

52:14.792 --> 52:17.081
We used to be journeymen.

52:17.083 --> 52:20.415
And now we are nothing more
than cucks and weaklings.

52:22.042 --> 52:23.123
Shame on us.

52:23.125 --> 52:24.248
Shame on us.

52:24.250 --> 52:25.415
Yes.

52:25.417 --> 52:28.540
But from ashes,

52:28.542 --> 52:31.000
something stronger is born.

52:33.208 --> 52:36.583
And change starts with each
and every one of you.

52:38.083 --> 52:39.540
Ask yourselves!

52:39.542 --> 52:43.083
What have I done to protect
my European heritage?

52:44.500 --> 52:46.206
Ask yourselves.

52:46.208 --> 52:50.498
What have I done to deserve
my ancestor's pride?

52:50.500 --> 52:52.123
<i>Nothing.</i>

52:52.125 --> 52:54.873
Well,
this movement needs leaders.

52:54.875 --> 52:57.498
This movement needs martyrs.

52:57.500 --> 53:00.208
This movement needs you!

53:01.375 --> 53:03.875
We will not be replaced.

53:05.083 --> 53:07.998
We will not be replaced.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.290
We will not be replaced.

53:11.292 --> 53:14.290
We will not be replaced!

53:14.292 --> 53:17.248
We will not be replaced!

53:17.250 --> 53:19.540
We will not be replaced!

53:19.542 --> 53:22.498
We will not be replaced!

53:22.500 --> 53:25.290
- We will not be replaced!
- Shut up!

53:25.292 --> 53:28.373
- We will not be replaced!
- Shut up!

53:28.375 --> 53:31.125
- We will not be replaced!
- Shut up!

53:33.583 --> 53:34.665
Shut up!

53:34.667 --> 53:36.373
We will not be replaced!

53:58.083 --> 53:59.292
There's only four bombs.

54:00.417 --> 54:02.333
We only need to find one more.

54:32.208 --> 54:33.750
- Hale.
- Yeah.

54:36.250 --> 54:37.540
It's finished.

54:37.542 --> 54:39.708
Yes! Yes, okay, great.

54:41.250 --> 54:43.415
Jude. Come with me.

54:43.417 --> 54:44.375
Caden,

54:45.625 --> 54:47.083
monitor their vitals.

54:49.167 --> 54:50.583
This is a bad idea, Hale.

55:09.458 --> 55:11.081
We can't track you in the unit.

55:11.083 --> 55:12.667
We haven't run
all the tests, Hale.

55:16.375 --> 55:17.667
Great job, Jude.

55:19.542 --> 55:20.625
Watch the door.

55:21.875 --> 55:22.917
I wanna fire it up.

56:11.875 --> 56:14.167
Are we still
in Max's memory?

56:17.042 --> 56:18.831
Why are we here?

56:34.833 --> 56:36.500
We're in
the Royal Unicorn!

56:40.417 --> 56:42.123
This is the night.

56:42.125 --> 56:43.542
That I met you.

56:48.375 --> 56:49.667
And Hale.

57:31.667 --> 57:33.831
<i>Disconnected.</i>

57:41.875 --> 57:46.415
We only need to find one bomb.

57:46.417 --> 57:48.875
The memory leaks are
getting worse with each dive.

57:53.042 --> 57:54.083
Where's Hale?

58:05.583 --> 58:06.583
Okay.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.248
Ow!

58:11.250 --> 58:12.498
You okay?

58:14.042 --> 58:15.417
You all right?

01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:20.708
No!

01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:24.206
Jude!

01:02:50.708 --> 01:02:52.000
You're CIA.

01:02:54.625 --> 01:02:55.831
Where's Theo?

01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:58.873
He's bomb hunting,
like you told him to.

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:00.081
You're CIA.

01:03:01.625 --> 01:03:04.915
I'm not CIA.
I work with Nev Mason.

01:03:04.917 --> 01:03:08.748
You work with Nev Mason,
tech billionaire Nev Mason.

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:09.792
Diamond Dust Nev Mason.

01:03:11.625 --> 01:03:13.831
He's the only reason
all of us are still breathing.

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:17.165
When did this happen?

01:03:17.167 --> 01:03:18.748
We were trying to help.

01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:22.000
'Cause I count one, two ghosts
in your haunted house, Mary.

01:03:23.125 --> 01:03:24.708
That was never the plan.

01:03:29.917 --> 01:03:31.998
What, are you gonna shoot me?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.083
You gonna shoot me?

01:03:36.292 --> 01:03:39.833
If I could go back
and save Doc, I would.

01:03:46.708 --> 01:03:48.415
Do you wanna see him again?

01:03:48.417 --> 01:03:49.623
- What?
- Doc.

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:50.875
You wanna see him again?

01:03:52.417 --> 01:03:53.665
Hear me out.

01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:55.081
So we build the cloud algorithm,

01:03:55.083 --> 01:03:57.290
all right, cook it up real nice

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:58.417
and then maybe,

01:03:59.625 --> 01:04:01.998
maybe you can ask Doc
for forgiveness.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.206
What are you saying?

01:04:03.208 --> 01:04:04.956
What I'm saying here,
Mary, is that

01:04:04.958 --> 01:04:07.790
what we have is a recipe
for a virtual heaven

01:04:07.792 --> 01:04:10.956
where we can basically
live forever.

01:04:10.958 --> 01:04:12.248
Forever!

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:13.665
And what do you want?

01:04:13.667 --> 01:04:15.290
Don't take us out
of the equation.

01:04:15.292 --> 01:04:17.081
We'll get you the code.

01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:19.665
Then what we do is we get Nev
to build a dome over it.

01:04:19.667 --> 01:04:22.083
We go public with it.
We do this, like, yesterday.

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:24.125
And then...

01:04:33.792 --> 01:04:36.581
And then we watch
the sun scrape the secrets

01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:37.750
from the shadows.

01:04:41.208 --> 01:04:42.208
I'm in.

01:05:01.667 --> 01:05:03.706
No, no, no!

01:05:03.708 --> 01:05:05.167
What am I doing back here?

01:05:06.167 --> 01:05:07.333
Not again.

01:06:06.958 --> 01:06:07.958
Hmm.

01:07:07.417 --> 01:07:09.165
- What's going on?
- We don't know.

01:07:09.167 --> 01:07:11.415
Their heart rates are skyrocketing.
We need to get them out.

01:07:11.417 --> 01:07:14.165
I need to get in there.
I need to help them, guys!

01:07:14.167 --> 01:07:15.706
What are you doing?

01:07:15.708 --> 01:07:17.123
We can do that.
We can do that.

01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:18.750
Just follow me. Come on.

01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:26.623
He made us build it for him.

01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:28.123
Help me get it up the stairs.

01:07:28.125 --> 01:07:29.167
Now!

01:07:30.875 --> 01:07:31.875
<i>Connecting.</i>

01:07:39.333 --> 01:07:40.500
Stop it!

01:07:47.417 --> 01:07:48.998
Stop it!

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:49.958
Stop it!

01:08:25.207 --> 01:08:26.875
What is he doing here?

01:08:27.917 --> 01:08:29.206
This is Max's memory.

01:08:29.207 --> 01:08:30.206
What?

01:08:30.207 --> 01:08:32.872
This is Max's memory!

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:34.372
Fragments of our memories
are leaking.

01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:36.375
This was his memory
the whole time.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.206
Where is he going?

01:08:42.207 --> 01:08:43.831
Z, Z, Z!

01:08:43.832 --> 01:08:45.206
We can't lose Max, okay?

01:08:45.207 --> 01:08:46.372
You're gonna have
to go after him.

01:08:46.375 --> 01:08:47.497
I'll go after Hale.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.457
Okay.

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:32.042
<i>Disconnected.</i>

01:09:33.042 --> 01:09:34.122
I need to go.

01:09:34.125 --> 01:09:35.957
The last bomb is
at the Royal Unicorn!

01:09:36.957 --> 01:09:38.706
- Call the cops.
- I got it.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.125
Get off me.

01:09:43.167 --> 01:09:45.332
It's Caden.
She found the last bomb.

01:09:53.375 --> 01:09:54.540
Copy.

01:09:54.542 --> 01:09:55.583
What's the play here?

01:09:56.583 --> 01:09:57.748
We stay here.

01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:58.831
We protect the tech.

01:09:58.833 --> 01:10:00.042
That is priority.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.083
Amazing!

01:10:22.125 --> 01:10:23.123
Do you love her?

01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:24.206
<i>Opa!</i>

01:10:24.208 --> 01:10:25.500
Snap out of it!

01:10:27.625 --> 01:10:29.373
Do you love her?

01:10:29.375 --> 01:10:31.498
I didn't want to stand
in the way of your happiness.

01:10:33.042 --> 01:10:35.040
That's why I walked away
from you and Z.

01:10:35.042 --> 01:10:36.165
Hey!

01:10:36.167 --> 01:10:37.581
That's why I walked away
from Fluxxx.

01:10:37.583 --> 01:10:39.456
Just tell me
you love her, man?

01:10:39.458 --> 01:10:41.665
Yes! I love her!

01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:42.998
There you go!

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:46.165
I've loved her from the start.

01:10:46.167 --> 01:10:47.456
Here we go.

01:10:47.458 --> 01:10:49.290
Now if you please,
I'm trying to have

01:10:49.292 --> 01:10:51.292
a quiet dinner with my family.

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:56.542
I'm the only family you have.

01:11:01.792 --> 01:11:03.958
You selfish prick.

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:08.458
Look around.
Look where we are.

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.206
Innocent lives hang
in the balance

01:11:11.208 --> 01:11:12.623
and we're here.

01:11:23.083 --> 01:11:24.208
He's here.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.833
Who's here?

01:11:56.375 --> 01:11:57.540
Hale?

01:11:57.542 --> 01:11:59.040
Hale, who is it?

01:12:12.125 --> 01:12:13.290
Get out!

01:12:15.542 --> 01:12:16.625
Get out!

01:12:54.667 --> 01:12:55.831
My best friend!

01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:57.081
She's still in there.

01:12:57.083 --> 01:12:59.042
Go, I'll get her.

01:14:06.833 --> 01:14:09.083
You fucker!

01:14:10.333 --> 01:14:11.375
You...

01:14:12.792 --> 01:14:14.415
We gotta move, come on.

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:15.458
Where's Z?

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:18.542
Where's Z?

01:14:20.333 --> 01:14:21.790
Where is she?

01:14:21.792 --> 01:14:23.040
She went to the Unicorn.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:24.915
- She's gone.
- What? Why?

01:14:24.917 --> 01:14:26.165
Z!

01:14:26.167 --> 01:14:28.706
She tried to stop
the last bomb. We gotta go.

01:14:28.708 --> 01:14:29.790
Z!

01:14:29.792 --> 01:14:31.875
Get off me!

01:15:00.417 --> 01:15:01.375
Hey!

01:15:15.292 --> 01:15:17.167
Come on! Let's move it!

01:16:32.125 --> 01:16:33.792
Where the hell am I?

01:16:35.042 --> 01:16:36.208
What happened?

01:16:38.667 --> 01:16:39.915
What happened.

01:16:39.917 --> 01:16:42.123
Uh, nothing happened.

01:16:42.125 --> 01:16:45.083
Okay, that is a lie.

01:16:46.375 --> 01:16:47.667
That's strike one.

01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:50.250
Three strikes.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.625
And I'll put a bullet
in your head.

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:07.998
Lawyer.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.498
You can have a cigarette.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.415
I know my rights!

01:17:11.417 --> 01:17:12.833
I want a bloody lawyer!

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.165
I got three dead bodies.

01:17:16.167 --> 01:17:17.373
Two missing people.

01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:18.873
That's a mess, Theo.

01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:20.540
That's a mess,
that's a real mess.

01:17:20.542 --> 01:17:21.831
Now you can scream and kick,

01:17:21.833 --> 01:17:24.123
you can shit yourself
for all I care.

01:17:26.333 --> 01:17:28.206
But you're not leaving here
with a pulse

01:17:28.208 --> 01:17:29.583
unless you answer my questions.

01:17:32.417 --> 01:17:33.583
What happened?

01:17:38.458 --> 01:17:39.458
Doc died.

01:17:41.042 --> 01:17:43.081
- What was Doc hiding?
- Fuck if I know.

01:17:43.083 --> 01:17:44.623
Strike two.

01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:45.625
Watch the tone.

01:17:47.917 --> 01:17:50.833
I've told you
everything I know.

01:17:52.458 --> 01:17:55.625
Z. She saved all those people
and you had to kill her too.

01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:01.915
- Where is Hale?
- Where is Hale?

01:18:01.917 --> 01:18:03.498
How the hell would I know!

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.540
I don't know!

01:18:04.542 --> 01:18:05.831
I don't know!

01:18:05.833 --> 01:18:06.873
I don't know!

01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:08.123
Theo!

01:18:08.125 --> 01:18:10.206
It's okay. Take it easy.

01:18:10.208 --> 01:18:11.540
Just give it to us.

01:18:11.542 --> 01:18:13.373
Just give us
the cloud algorithm

01:18:13.375 --> 01:18:14.415
and we'll all be copacetic.

01:18:14.417 --> 01:18:15.667
I don't have it.

01:18:18.208 --> 01:18:19.500
But if I did,

01:18:22.458 --> 01:18:24.833
I'd sooner die than give it
to you bastards.

01:18:29.292 --> 01:18:30.417
That's strike three.

01:18:38.917 --> 01:18:40.583
But I'm feeling generous

01:18:43.292 --> 01:18:44.833
so I'm gonna give you
a five count.

01:18:47.208 --> 01:18:48.208
Do it!

01:18:53.917 --> 01:18:55.125
Do it!

01:18:59.667 --> 01:19:00.665
Five.

01:19:03.667 --> 01:19:04.667
Four.

01:19:07.625 --> 01:19:08.667
Three.

01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:12.540
Two.

01:19:12.542 --> 01:19:14.250
<i>That's enough, thank you.</i>

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:17.042
Yes sir, Mr. Mason.

01:19:18.042 --> 01:19:19.998
What are you doing?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
I was getting into that.

01:19:25.417 --> 01:19:26.542
What's happening?

01:19:29.292 --> 01:19:30.458
You passed.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:35.875
You're not the CIA.

01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:38.417
Hell, no.

01:19:41.083 --> 01:19:43.458
Nev Mason has a proposition
for you.

01:19:59.792 --> 01:20:01.081
<i>The alpha test?</i>

01:20:01.083 --> 01:20:02.292
Within a month.

01:20:03.583 --> 01:20:05.375
We'll start with
the initial upload tests.

01:20:10.333 --> 01:20:11.292
<i>How's Theo?</i>

01:20:12.292 --> 01:20:13.998
<i>He's underground.</i>

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.083
<i>It's a process.</i>

01:20:17.833 --> 01:20:19.208
<i>And the algorithm?</i>

01:20:20.208 --> 01:20:21.250
<i>Did he get it?</i>

01:20:24.333 --> 01:20:26.542
<i>Doc never managed
to erase it from his memory.</i>

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.500
<i>It was there the whole time.</i>

01:20:35.625 --> 01:20:37.042
<i>And Z's avatar?</i>

01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:40.208
<i>Have you seen it?</i>

01:20:41.708 --> 01:20:42.833
<i>Yes.</i>

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:48.500
<i>He created
something incredible.</i>

01:20:51.167 --> 01:20:53.081
Test 367.

01:20:53.083 --> 01:20:54.708
Olfactory authenticity.

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:56.956
This is it.

01:20:56.958 --> 01:20:57.956
This is it.

01:21:08.125 --> 01:21:09.375
<i>Connected.</i>

01:21:47.792 --> 01:21:49.333
You forgot your shoes.

01:21:56.375 --> 01:21:57.667
You haven't changed.

01:22:22.292 --> 01:22:23.500
When can I see Doc?

01:22:25.333 --> 01:22:26.750
<i>Doc's avatar is ready.</i>

01:22:27.833 --> 01:22:28.875
Good.

01:22:30.208 --> 01:22:31.415
That's good.

01:22:31.417 --> 01:22:36.042
My favorite quote is by
a German physicist,

01:22:37.083 --> 01:22:38.083
Max Planck.

01:22:39.292 --> 01:22:40.915
And he said,

01:22:40.917 --> 01:22:44.581
"science advances
one funeral at the time."

01:22:44.583 --> 01:22:46.790
Isn't that the truth?

01:22:46.792 --> 01:22:48.333
Isn't that the truth?

01:22:56.208 --> 01:22:57.583
This is the...

01:23:11.583 --> 01:23:13.373
We're taking the red eye.

01:23:13.375 --> 01:23:14.500
Tonight.

01:23:16.917 --> 01:23:19.165
<i>Theo has seen the space.</i>

01:23:19.167 --> 01:23:21.165
<i>As you can see, we got lots...</i>

01:23:21.167 --> 01:23:23.625
<i>Mr. Mason is
almost ready to launch.</i>

01:23:26.458 --> 01:23:28.375
Here's the
bathroom downstairs.

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:33.040
That would be perfect
for a little office space.

01:23:33.042 --> 01:23:34.458
<i>What about the name?</i>

01:23:35.833 --> 01:23:36.958
<i>Has he chosen one?</i>

01:23:42.167 --> 01:23:44.958
<i>Yes, he has.</i>

01:23:48.792 --> 01:23:50.000
<i>What about Hale?</i>

01:23:52.833 --> 01:23:54.833
<i>He went dark.</i>

01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:06.540
Find him.

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:07.667
We need to shut him down.

01:24:39.417 --> 01:24:40.665
<i>Connected.</i>
