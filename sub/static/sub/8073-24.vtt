[theme music]

00:08.176 --> 00:09.277
What are you doing?

00:09.310 --> 00:11.445
I'm watching my stories.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.314
Bo really loves
Nora, but the court

00:13.347 --> 00:15.015
case is tearing him apart.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.850
I mean, court is helping
out Luna because Max--

00:16.884 --> 00:18.686
Oh, I just dropped your baby.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.221
Sh.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.055
In a second.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.859
Oh Jackie, you're not
going to get what you want

00:25.893 --> 00:27.695
from these soap opera guys.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.897
They can only love
you for an hour a day.

00:29.930 --> 00:34.102
Of course, that is four
times longer than Dan.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.303
Well, they may
not really exist

00:35.336 --> 00:37.171
but they're better than Fred.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.240
I am not going to let
this happen to you, Jackie.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.541
You're turning
into that scary old

00:40.574 --> 00:42.143
lady down the block
with a satellite

00:42.176 --> 00:44.245
dish and the tall grass.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.147
[knocking]

00:46.180 --> 00:47.915
FRED: Hey, Jackie.

00:47.948 --> 00:50.151
Oh, Get rid of him.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.725
Hey, Roseanne.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.494
Came by to talk to Jackie.
Think it's a good idea.

01:00.528 --> 01:04.498
Sure, you got your
dental records, don't you?

01:04.532 --> 01:06.200
I didn't mean to hurt
her feelings, Roseanne.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.801
I was going to propose
and everything.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.438
But it just seemed like a
more sensible idea for us

01:10.471 --> 01:11.772
to live together.

01:11.805 --> 01:16.076
Well, aren't you just Jackie's
knight in sensible armor.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.846
What's she been doing
the last couple of days.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.382
She's been comparing you
to these soap opera guys.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.250
Guess who's ahead?

01:27.688 --> 01:32.326
Oh god, I suppose she wants
me to be more like this guy.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.696
No, that guy's in
love with his mailman.

01:35.729 --> 01:39.467
But maybe some of
these other guys.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.335
Roseanne, I don't understand
this romantic stuff.

01:41.369 --> 01:42.603
What am I supposed to do?

01:42.636 --> 01:44.037
I don't know, but
you should do something

01:44.071 --> 01:45.773
just for her, real special.

01:45.806 --> 01:46.974
Like what?

01:47.007 --> 01:49.910
I don't know but it
should be like, you know,

01:49.943 --> 01:52.480
big and dramatic.

01:52.513 --> 01:55.283
She's always hated that beard.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.116
My beard?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.925
Hey, I've had this
beard since high school.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.260
Yeah, I know.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.296
But you were just wearing it
then so you could look old.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.730
Trust me, you don't
need it no more.

02:12.533 --> 02:13.834
But Roseanne, I
always thought my beard

02:13.867 --> 02:16.136
made me look more interesting.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.538
You know, I've talked
to a lot of women.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.274
And they say that the only
interesting thing about you,

02:20.308 --> 02:21.108
is Jackie.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.846
Well, all right.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.948
I love this beard
but if you think

02:27.981 --> 02:31.084
shaving it off is going
to prove something to her,

02:31.118 --> 02:33.987
I'll give it a try.

02:34.021 --> 02:34.888
Thanks, Roseanne.

02:34.922 --> 02:35.723
No problem.

02:39.993 --> 02:40.994
What did you do that for?

02:41.028 --> 02:43.397
I don't hate his beard.
- Yeah, I know.

02:43.431 --> 02:47.067
But it always kind of bugged me.

02:47.100 --> 02:51.004
[music playing]

03:37.485 --> 03:41.822
Why it's Darlene
and young David.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.223
I bought a rattle
for the baby, just

03:43.257 --> 03:44.091
thought I'd drop it off.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.560
Oh David, how sweet.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.329
Yeah, David's always
thrilled to meet

03:48.362 --> 03:49.463
someone smaller than him.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.101
He is so cute.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.703
I just love him.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.372
Darlene, you want to hold him?

03:58.406 --> 03:59.673
Uh, it's just
like a cat, right?

03:59.707 --> 04:00.941
You grab it by the
back of the neck?

04:04.011 --> 04:04.912
Little boy.

04:10.484 --> 04:13.120
Now what?

04:13.153 --> 04:14.655
Now just hold
him and enjoy it.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.995
OK, I'm done.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.236
How can you be done?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.805
Look at his little hat.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.774
Doesn't it make you
want to have a baby?

04:33.807 --> 04:35.242
No, I don't like kids.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.910
I didn't even like
myself till I was 14.

04:40.648 --> 04:43.116
Wait a minute, so you
don't want to have kids?

04:43.150 --> 04:44.685
I mean, I thought we were
going to be together.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.086
What if I want one?

04:46.119 --> 04:47.788
Well, you're going to have to
plant your seed somewhere else,

04:47.821 --> 04:48.622
farmer Bob.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.494
So what I want
doesn't count at all?

04:53.527 --> 04:56.196
I mean, having my baby
would be a wonderful way

04:56.229 --> 04:59.333
of saying how much you love me.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.802
Hearing you say that,
David, my new goal in life

05:01.835 --> 05:04.137
is to die barren.

05:04.171 --> 05:07.575
Don't be silly, Darlene,
women we're made to make babies.

05:07.608 --> 05:08.409
The end.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.981
God, not even you
could believe that crap,

05:14.014 --> 05:15.549
right, David?

05:15.583 --> 05:21.088
Well, you all seem to
be pretty good at it.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.189
So what are you saying?

05:22.222 --> 05:23.957
It's like a woman's
job to have children?

05:23.991 --> 05:25.826
I mean, can you
really be that sexist?

05:25.859 --> 05:26.727
Me?

05:26.760 --> 05:28.462
I am not sexist.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.330
I'm much too frightened
of women to be sexist.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.402
Well, then what did you mean?

05:34.435 --> 05:36.537
Well, I didn't
mean it was a job.

05:36.570 --> 05:40.974
I just think that it's every
woman's satisfying, fulfilling

05:41.008 --> 05:44.077
obligation.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.278
Oh come on, Darlene.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.414
This is not my opinion.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.781
This is just nature.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.149
I mean, you can't see
that because you're

05:49.182 --> 05:50.851
just being irrational.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.053
Oh you're right, David,
I'm not being rational.

05:53.086 --> 05:56.490
I know, I must have my
period or something, right?

05:56.524 --> 06:00.193
I would never say
that but are you?

06:00.227 --> 06:01.261
You know, David,
I just changed

06:01.294 --> 06:03.931
my mind about premarital sex.

06:03.964 --> 06:04.765
Darlene.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.970
She always gets like that.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.409
Did I tell you I
like his little hat?

06:15.443 --> 06:18.846
Stay away from my son.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.581
Don't mind Jackie, David.

06:20.614 --> 06:23.083
I think her friend is visiting.

06:27.455 --> 06:31.825
[music playing]

06:38.365 --> 06:41.334
What?

06:41.368 --> 06:43.471
What's the matter?

06:43.504 --> 06:45.172
Jackie just told me
what you said to Darlene

06:45.205 --> 06:47.374
and I cannot believe you.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.376
She didn't understand me.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.244
She said that you told
her that having a baby

06:51.278 --> 06:52.713
was her obligation.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.547
Oh.

06:56.684 --> 06:57.951
Well, I guess she
did understand me.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.226
Women.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.761
How can she think
I'm anti-woman?

07:07.795 --> 07:08.662
She's your wife.

07:08.696 --> 07:09.897
Compared to you, I am a woman.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.905
Compared to a
woman, you're a woman.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.707
Maybe it just so
happens that I'm

07:19.740 --> 07:22.142
secure enough with my
masculinity to be a woman.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.681
Dave, your problem is
women expect a lot from you.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.950
And when you turn out
just to be another guy,

07:29.983 --> 07:32.586
then they're all let down.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.288
So you think it's
better for a woman

07:35.322 --> 07:36.957
not to expect much of you.

07:36.990 --> 07:42.029
Sure, then any little thing
you do, they love you for it.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.564
Thanks, Mark.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.098
You don't usually
help me out like this.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.567
We should talk more often.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.467
Yeah, I'd like to.

07:47.501 --> 07:48.636
Really?

07:48.669 --> 07:50.003
Yeah but right now
I've got to run upstairs.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.272
When I tell Becky I think
you're a sexist jerk,

07:52.305 --> 07:53.541
it's going to pay off big.

07:58.078 --> 08:02.415
[music playing]

08:03.483 --> 08:05.218
Got another one for you.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.520
Where'd you get that?

08:06.554 --> 08:09.156
I'm already watching
every dish in the house.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.991
Yeah, I'd like to help but
I think there's a game on.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.192
All right, enjoy yourself.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.927
I'm just going to
keep doing the dishes

08:13.961 --> 08:15.162
because I noticed
that there's still

08:15.195 --> 08:17.731
some skin left on my hands.

08:17.765 --> 08:18.566
Hey guys.

08:22.603 --> 08:23.470
See, Dan.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.572
What did I tell you?

08:24.605 --> 08:25.806
He does have a waking
characterless chin.

08:28.542 --> 08:32.012
I got to talk to Jackie
right away because I

08:32.045 --> 08:33.046
think I know what she wants.

08:33.080 --> 08:33.914
I've been watching her soaps.

08:37.117 --> 08:40.220
Jackie, we've got to talk.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.022
Oh god, Fred.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.190
What, you keep
showing up you think

08:43.223 --> 08:45.759
eventually I'll change my mind?

08:45.793 --> 08:46.594
Will you marry me?

08:49.462 --> 08:50.964
Don't you think
we should leave?

08:55.168 --> 08:58.371
We should, but pipe down.

08:58.405 --> 09:03.143
Fred, I don't feel like I can
give you an answer right now.

09:03.176 --> 09:06.046
That's good because I
don't want your answer yet.

09:06.079 --> 09:09.482
First, I want to take you away
up to a cabin by Lake Geneva.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.251
I rented a red one,
right on the water,

09:11.284 --> 09:12.920
just like the one you
use to dream about when

09:12.953 --> 09:15.956
you were a little girl.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.959
And then I went to sit
in front of the fireplace

09:18.992 --> 09:22.395
and I want a drink champagne,
and just look at you.

09:22.429 --> 09:25.733
And I don't want you to
answer me until midnight

09:25.766 --> 09:30.037
because that way, if you say
no, I'll have had at least

09:30.070 --> 09:31.939
one perfect night with you.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.544
You can watch
the kid, can't you?

09:47.655 --> 09:49.189
Aw, I don't know
about you, but I

09:49.222 --> 09:51.124
had a tough time keeping a
straight face through that one.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.896
What?

09:55.929 --> 09:56.964
Oh, come on, Roseanne.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.598
Couldn't you see
what's going on?

09:58.632 --> 10:00.901
Ole Freddy was in the doghouse
and he barked his way out.

10:03.570 --> 10:06.506
Damn, no game on.

10:06.539 --> 10:09.743
I do not believe you, Dan.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.378
The most romantic thing
we're probably ever

10:11.411 --> 10:14.948
witness in our lives, right
here in our own house,

10:14.982 --> 10:17.217
and it doesn't even touch
you in the least bit.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.618
Yeah, it touched me.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.187
Who said it didn't touch me?

10:20.220 --> 10:21.454
I just-- oh look, rugby.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.727
We have no romance
in our lives.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.661
What are you talking about?

10:27.695 --> 10:29.329
I'm very romantic.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.698
Your idea of
romance is popping

10:30.731 --> 10:33.801
the can away from my face.

10:33.834 --> 10:37.838
Come on, Roseanne, we're too
old for what that stuff Jackie

10:37.871 --> 10:40.107
and Fred are going to do there.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.677
Besides, we've got stuff
that's better than romance.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.746
We've got memories of romance.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.986
I'm just going to watch
this game if that's OK.

10:57.825 --> 10:58.926
You don't need the game, Dan.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.461
You've got memories of games.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.836
I must remember to beat Fred.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.981
Well, so you
joined us at last.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.216
This is most truly a
wonderful surprise.

11:27.888 --> 11:31.124
Well, my marriage has
finally hit the skids.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.159
I'm all yours, boys.

11:38.598 --> 11:43.470
Now that you're here,
my thirst is quenched.

11:43.503 --> 11:46.740
Hold on, you two.

11:46.774 --> 11:50.277
You may be my brother
and you may be my son,

11:50.310 --> 11:55.448
but this is a woman, a
woman I'm not related to.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.452
Out of my way.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.692
Wait a minute, I'm
looking for romance

12:05.725 --> 12:09.096
but I can't have all of you.

12:09.129 --> 12:13.033
At least not at the same time.

12:13.066 --> 12:18.105
If you'll be mine, my darling,
I can give you everything

12:18.138 --> 12:20.908
you've always wanted.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.676
Wow, I've always
wanted everything

12:23.710 --> 12:24.544
that I've always wanted.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.016
Don't listen to him.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.450
OK?

12:30.483 --> 12:34.754
Because what you need is a
soul mate, someone who knows

12:34.788 --> 12:40.493
your deepest, darkest thoughts.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.030
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER):
Man, this guy is good.

12:43.063 --> 12:47.367
He really knows what goes
on inside of us women.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.468
MAN (VOICEOVER): It's true.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.271
I do know what's going
on inside of you.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.073
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER): Really?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.207
Can you hear this?

12:54.241 --> 12:55.475
MAN (VOICEOVER): Yes.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.444
Can you hear this?

12:57.477 --> 13:00.380
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER): Wow,
talk about being in sync.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.086
What about you, Kord?

13:13.393 --> 13:17.197
Wow, good answer.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.232
DAN: Roseanne, I'm home.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.700
Change it, it's my husband.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.640
Hey, I thought I kicked you out.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.676
Oh, you kicked out Dan Conner.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.144
I have returned as Dan Juan.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.616
How come you don't
smell like cars?

13:36.649 --> 13:39.119
Because I am wearing cologne.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.420
Where'd you get that?

13:40.453 --> 13:44.524
You better not have watered
down any of my gin-no-te.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.159
No, it's my own.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.996
They come in the mail.

13:49.029 --> 13:53.466
From the vintage
cellars of the AMP.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.568
Wow, wine.

13:55.602 --> 13:59.739
We haven't had wine since
the night we celebrated

13:59.772 --> 14:01.641
the odometer on your
truck rolling all

14:01.674 --> 14:02.943
the way around to zero again.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.582
Break out the
crazy straws, baby.

14:09.616 --> 14:10.984
I am in a mood.

14:14.387 --> 14:17.224
Oh, Dan, you know I am
a sucker for a man who

14:17.257 --> 14:20.427
can harness the power of fire.

14:20.460 --> 14:25.765
Well, prepare yourself
for a little treat.

14:25.798 --> 14:26.599
Let the romance begin.

14:31.905 --> 14:32.940
Romancing the bone?

14:40.547 --> 14:41.748
Yeah, I figure
we could pop it in.

14:41.781 --> 14:42.682
Watch it for a few minutes.

14:42.715 --> 14:43.516
And then, you know.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.155
Then what?

14:48.188 --> 14:48.989
Barf?

14:52.425 --> 14:54.995
I did something
wrong, didn't I?

14:55.028 --> 14:55.895
No, Dan.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.530
You just did everything wrong.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.400
This is nothing but
disgusting, pornographic filth.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.870
It's got romance in the title.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.039
It's just some sicko
male fantasy that only

15:06.073 --> 15:07.774
appeals to other sicko males.

15:07.807 --> 15:08.675
It can't be just for men.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.611
It's got scenes with only women.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.713
I did this for you.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.283
Fine, if you don't want this,
what the hell do you want?

15:16.316 --> 15:17.784
Dan, we've married 21 years.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.386
You ought to know
what I want by now.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.653
Well, obviously I don't.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.622
Why don't you just tell
me and I'll just do it.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.824
Because, if I have to
tell you what it is, then

15:24.857 --> 15:26.693
I might as well just
go do it myself.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.939
Darlene, may I speak
with you, please?

15:39.973 --> 15:42.075
Hey Dave, we don't need
that macho crap in here.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.980
I think I can handle it.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.848
I know you can, it's
just the kind of stuff

15:48.881 --> 15:51.851
that this guy says
really ticks me off.

15:51.884 --> 15:52.919
Makes us all look like pigs.

15:56.723 --> 16:00.460
I put mayo on both sides,
just the way you like it.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.394
Oh, thanks, babe.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.000
Darlene, listen.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.002
I realize how unfair
I was being to you.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.941
Look, the fact is
I love you so much

16:14.974 --> 16:16.276
that even if you don't
want to have kids

16:16.309 --> 16:17.744
I still want to be
with you forever.

16:17.777 --> 16:18.578
Wow.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.549
I mean, David, you're
never going to be

16:22.582 --> 16:25.518
happy if you don't have kids.

16:25.552 --> 16:30.757
Well, if you ever change
your mind, no pressure,

16:30.790 --> 16:32.092
and you're willing
to have kids, I mean,

16:32.125 --> 16:34.127
I could be the one to
stay home and raise them.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.396
I could change the diapers
and take them to school

16:36.429 --> 16:38.498
and do all that stuff.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.566
You'd do that?

16:39.599 --> 16:40.400
Yeah.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.437
Wow.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.139
I mean, but would you
still have time to cook?

16:49.142 --> 16:50.277
Of course.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.445
I know how important
having a career is to you.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.382
I want you to have
everything you want in life.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.284
Thanks.

16:57.317 --> 17:00.287
That is so romantic.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.354
Romantic?

17:01.388 --> 17:02.722
The guy who stays at
home while the girl

17:02.755 --> 17:05.925
goes out and earns a living?

17:05.958 --> 17:07.860
So you wouldn't be
willing to do that for me?

17:07.894 --> 17:10.063
No, it would be stupid.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.431
Why would it be stupid?

17:11.464 --> 17:12.965
Because there's no way you
could ever make as much as me.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.373
That's because the world
is so unfair to women.

17:32.552 --> 17:36.623
Oh, Kord, I'm so
glad I picked you.

17:36.656 --> 17:40.927
To hell with those other
guys and their shirts.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.530
Perhaps, a sweet.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.599
Wow, this looks like
real antique china.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.434
Yes.

17:51.003 --> 17:53.640
I would never dream of asking
you to soil your delicate hands

17:53.673 --> 17:55.742
washing dishes.

17:55.775 --> 18:00.780
Boy, you sure do
talk purty for a man.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.916
A night of romance is what
I have in store for you, girl.

18:03.950 --> 18:06.219
A night you will never forget.

18:06.253 --> 18:09.656
But first, we must share this.

18:14.761 --> 18:15.828
Romancing the bone?

18:19.732 --> 18:23.170
[music playing]

18:24.171 --> 18:25.472
I'm home, Dan, so get out.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.940
It's my turn in the house.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.209
Hark the sound of angels.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.109
Welcome home, honey.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.311
I got a little surprise for you.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.579
Oh no, not again.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.780
Oh, come on, Roseanne.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.415
I watched your soap,
just like Fred.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.518
You know, I think I
learned a few things.

18:38.551 --> 18:41.288
Surprise.

18:41.321 --> 18:44.191
Oh, Dan, you cleaned up.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.458
No, I cooked dinner.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.627
Who says you can't put a
metal pan in a microwave?

18:52.098 --> 18:53.800
You know, I really
appreciate the effort, honey.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.135
But you don't get it, so please
just don't try anymore, OK?

18:56.169 --> 18:57.304
What?

18:57.337 --> 18:59.639
A candlelit dinner,
that's romantic, isn't it?

18:59.672 --> 19:05.212
Yeah, if there wasn't seagulls
hovering above the sink.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.680
Yeah, I guess I
could wash those.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.449
Or, oh, wait a minute.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.251
I got an idea.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.620
You know, maybe it
would make your life

19:13.653 --> 19:16.589
easier if I gave you this.

19:16.623 --> 19:17.690
What?

19:17.724 --> 19:21.127
Yes, Mrs. R Conner
of Lanford, Illinois.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.697
Say hello to your only
slightly used dishwasher.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.233
Oh my god.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.000
Yeah, it's pretty
great, isn't it?

19:28.034 --> 19:29.436
No, I was watching
those soap operas.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.170
I didn't know what the hell
they were talking about.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.540
But man, they got
commercials for all kinds

19:33.573 --> 19:36.042
of dishwashing stuff.

19:36.075 --> 19:40.747
Did you know that glasses
aren't supposed to have spots?

19:40.780 --> 19:44.284
Oh Dan, I love you
despite your many flaws.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.854
And I love you
despite my many flaws.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.022
So is there something
special I can do for you?

19:50.056 --> 19:51.558
If I had to tell you,
it wouldn't be romantic.

19:57.764 --> 20:01.100
[music playing]

20:03.636 --> 20:05.071
Hey.

20:05.104 --> 20:07.807
Man, this thing
is so cool to watch.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.309
We should take it out
there in the living room

20:09.342 --> 20:11.711
and trade in the
TV for more dishes.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.246
I'm going to get another beer.
You want one?

20:13.280 --> 20:14.947
Yeah, but put mine
in a glass and then

20:14.981 --> 20:17.917
bring it to me on a plate.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.519
I'm back, so--

20:19.552 --> 20:20.420
Did you say yes?

20:20.453 --> 20:21.921
I said yes.

20:21.954 --> 20:27.327
[cheering]

20:27.360 --> 20:28.728
Congratulations, man.

20:28.761 --> 20:29.562
Yeah, thanks.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.804
How's that traffic?

20:37.837 --> 20:40.239
Not bad.

20:40.273 --> 20:43.075
So where's the baby because I
want to tell him that his daddy

20:43.109 --> 20:46.346
is going to be his daddy.

20:46.379 --> 20:49.716
So, you pulled it off, huh?

20:49.749 --> 20:51.851
Yeah, I couldn't
even believe it myself.

20:51.884 --> 20:58.991
But it turns out, I'm kind of
great at this romantic stuff.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.628
So any time you need any
pointers, I'm here for you.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.566
Well, I'm not
an expert like you

21:06.599 --> 21:09.201
but after 21 years
of marriage there

21:09.235 --> 21:13.306
is a little trick I learned
that I could pass on to you.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.674
Really, what is it?

21:14.707 --> 21:16.208
Oh, you're just being nice.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.478
You don't want my advice.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.712
No, seriously.

21:19.746 --> 21:20.547
I'm curious.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.417
Surprise her with this.
