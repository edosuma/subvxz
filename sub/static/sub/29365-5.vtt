00:32.532 --> 00:33.366

00:33.950 --> 00:36.661

and threw me on the floor.

00:36.953 --> 00:37.954
[Colt] Uh!

00:38.371 --> 00:39.748
Your hair hit my shoulder.

that late on a school night.

-Yeah.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.898
That Shania song came on,

01:04.981 --> 01:07.567
I did the dance,
and then it was game over.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.154

You can't make her do anything.

It's like when I tried to get you to go
to those meetings for your PTSD.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.560
That worked. I was gonna go,

but, you know, it was
cutting into my special Uncle Beau time.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.109
The point is, you're gonna go
when you're ready.

it's drinking a 20-year-old beer

I'm the new guy, but...

I think this giant dam is
what's stopping your water.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.389
[Beau] Jesus Christ.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.349
[Colt] How far do you think
we walked, Dad?

12:06.642 --> 12:08.894
I'd say we're on the old Stockwell Ranch.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.897
This is Neumann's Hill property now.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.315
Fucking Lisa Neumann.

12:14.150 --> 12:14.984
She did this.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.069
[Luke] Look at this craftsmanship.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.281
I know it's not the right time
but if you ever need a dam,

12:20.364 --> 12:22.366
you should hire
whoever built this thing.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.660
[Colt] This water
feeds our whole operation.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.913
Our cows drink from it,
we use it to irrigate.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.458
Without it, we're done in a week.

12:30.916 --> 12:31.751
Don't worry.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.794
Lisa's coming by the ranch
in the morning.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.755
She's taking this fucking thing down.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.299
[Colt] Fuck this shit!

12:39.091 --> 12:40.926
[Luke] Sorry about this, man, but...

12:41.635 --> 12:42.720
we'll make it right.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.057
Oh, hey, and when you talk to Lisa,
find out who built this.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.810
I mean, the structural integrity
is off the charts.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.687
This could hold back the Atlantic Ocea--

12:51.771 --> 12:53.939
Stop complimenting
the fucking dam!

12:59.695 --> 13:00.654
Joanne?

13:00.905 --> 13:02.072
[Joanne] Hey, Dale.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.867
If you're looking for Beau,
he's out in the field.

13:05.075 --> 13:08.037
In fact, if he knew you were coming,
that might be why he's out in the field.

13:08.120 --> 13:08.996
[Dale laughs]

13:09.705 --> 13:12.166
Actually, I came by to see you.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.337
Charlene baked you an apple pie.

13:16.420 --> 13:19.965
I had to take a little slice
to make sure it wasn't poisoned.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.219
So she baked me a pie.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.012
Dammit! Beau told you, didn't he?

13:26.096 --> 13:30.267
You two gossip more than
Dawn Hammond down at the nail salon.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.187
If you have to start a story with
"I shouldn't be saying this,"

13:33.270 --> 13:35.022
you shouldn't be fucking saying it.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.067
We're not gossips.

13:38.692 --> 13:39.610
But...

13:39.985 --> 13:41.278
speaking of Dawn,

13:41.529 --> 13:44.532
did you know she got one
of those CoolSculpting deals

13:44.615 --> 13:46.659
where they freeze the fat, you know?

13:47.618 --> 13:50.913
She literally froze her ass off.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.167
I knew she had some work done.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.045
Diet and exercise? Please!

13:58.128 --> 13:59.088
Fuck you, Dawn!

13:59.171 --> 14:00.256
[Dale laughs]

14:02.299 --> 14:03.133
But...

14:04.218 --> 14:07.555
Dale, now that Beau has told you,
don't tell anybody else, okay?

14:08.848 --> 14:10.182
[sighs] You know...

14:11.725 --> 14:12.893
about a year ago,

14:15.479 --> 14:18.190
Charlene was diagnosed with Parkinson's.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.901
Oh, Jesus, Dale.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.570
I'm so sorry.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.155
Why didn't you tell us?

14:25.739 --> 14:29.034
Charlene didn't want
people feeling sorry for her.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.327
Well, I get that.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.539
I don't want everyone asking me
how I'm doing all the time.

14:33.622 --> 14:34.915
I just wanna forget about it.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.627
The good news is... you're going to.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.339
[Joanne chuckles]

14:42.631 --> 14:46.886
Yeah, Charlene's condition
made us realize we've got to...

14:47.386 --> 14:49.263
savor every moment.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.682
We go out dancing,

14:52.141 --> 14:53.517
try new restaurants.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.020
In the past year, we've traveled more

14:56.103 --> 14:58.772
than we traveled all the years
we were married.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.191
You almost make it sound
like it's a good thing.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.818
In a way, it has been.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.737
Like I always say,

15:04.987 --> 15:08.282
you get busy living or get busy dying.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.160
Do you always say that?

15:11.535 --> 15:14.079
Or was it Morgan Freeman
in Shawshank Redemption?

15:17.041 --> 15:19.001
Well, I was hoping that was something

15:19.084 --> 15:21.253
that, err... you'd already forgot.

15:29.219 --> 15:30.679
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.098
What are you making worse?

15:35.309 --> 15:37.478
The brakes on the stroller are shot.

15:38.145 --> 15:39.480
The other day, at Walmart,

15:39.563 --> 15:41.065
I reached up to get some beer,

15:41.148 --> 15:44.151
I look down and Peyton is like
a runaway freight train down the aisle.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.655
That greeter didn't stand a chance.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.575
It was her first open-field tackle,
though. I teared up a bit.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.372
We never had a stroller
when you and Rooster were young.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.833
Just a lawn chair
in the back of a wheelbarrow.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.922
At the end of the day,
I just dumped you right in the bathtub,

16:05.297 --> 16:07.508
which was just a water trough
for the horse.

16:09.426 --> 16:10.803
You ever buy us anything?

16:10.886 --> 16:12.429
-Tetanus shots.
-Yeah.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.557
Alright. Let's see.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.228
Woah! Fixed it.

16:19.687 --> 16:20.646
Hey, do me a favor.

16:20.729 --> 16:23.440
Don't tell Abby
about me almost killing Peyton, okay?

16:24.441 --> 16:26.527
Things are going well for us for once.

16:26.610 --> 16:27.444
Is that right?

16:27.653 --> 16:30.406
[Colt] Yeah. We're spending
a little more time together.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.074
Oh. In fact...

16:33.033 --> 16:35.953
tonight, maybe you can make yourself
a little scarce, so...

16:36.161 --> 16:37.454
things can get romantic.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.833
[sarcastically] Oh, no!
Who will announce the game for me?

16:43.794 --> 16:44.628
Yeah.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.715
No, I'm sorry. It's too important.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.636
I actually think me and Abby
could get back together.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.932
Yeah. Hey, you remember
how you always wanted to kill me

16:57.016 --> 17:00.102
when I sang and danced
to that Shania Twain video?

17:00.894 --> 17:02.938
That thing almost saved my marriage.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.732
-♪ Ba ba ba--  ♪
-Stop!

17:06.734 --> 17:07.818
[car approaches]

17:09.570 --> 17:11.655
Here's Lisa Neumann.
It's fucking go time.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.615
[Beau] Let me handle this.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.909
[Colt] Why? It's my ranch.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.245
You only seem to do two things to women.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.622
You either piss them off
or get them pregnant.

17:22.791 --> 17:23.917
Morning, gentlemen.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.127
Lisa.

17:25.377 --> 17:28.672
Why the fuck would you put a dam in
to cut off my water supply?

17:30.841 --> 17:33.093
You had your chance.
You blew it with "Lisa."

17:35.304 --> 17:36.597
I knew this was coming.

17:37.347 --> 17:41.018
We're using the Stockwell Ranch
to grow grass, alfalfa.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.563
It's gonna support all the
Neumann's Hill ranches in the area.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.523
And to do that, I need more water.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.734
So, I'm putting in an irrigation pond.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.320
Colt's ranch depends on that stream.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.614
That thing's gonna be dry in a week.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.866
How am I gonna keep my cows alive?

17:55.991 --> 17:57.993
[stutters] Is it gonna be
Bennett Brother Beef,

17:58.077 --> 17:59.703
grass-fed and Gatorade-finished?

18:01.830 --> 18:04.458
There are other ways to get water.
You could drill a well.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.669
[scoffs] Oh! Yeah! A well, Daddy.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.047
What's that gonna be, like,
ten, twenty grand?

18:10.130 --> 18:12.174
Let me just pull that money outta my ass.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.469
Gee! Lookee there!

18:15.594 --> 18:18.013
I ain't got no money in my ass, Lisa!

18:19.932 --> 18:22.184
Tear down that dam!

18:23.685 --> 18:25.229
I bought the Stockwell Ranch

18:25.312 --> 18:29.399
because its water rights have priority
over any other ranch in the county.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.026
I had my lawyers check on that.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.613
Yeah? Well, my lawyers said
that your lawyers can go fuck themselves.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.034
You don't do this
to another rancher, Lisa.

18:40.035 --> 18:42.246
You also don't steal
another rancher's bull.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.789
I didn't steal your fucking bull.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.916
-Is that what this is about?
-No.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.293
The fact is, I need that water.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.464
Without it, I can't grow grass,
and without feed, my cows will die.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.135
You're trying to drive me outta business
'cause you want my ranch.

18:56.969 --> 19:00.347
Colt... you're failing just fine
without my help.

19:03.016 --> 19:03.976
You think

19:04.643 --> 19:05.936
'cause you got money

19:06.687 --> 19:09.439
and lawyers, you can just do
whatever the hell you want.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.317
You are fucking with the wrong guy.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.577
Sorry he's upset
but you have to understand--

19:21.660 --> 19:23.287
I'll tell you what I understand.

19:24.454 --> 19:25.289
When we met,

19:25.914 --> 19:27.374
you said we're both ranchers,

19:28.375 --> 19:29.710
that we were a lot alike.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.714
That couldn't have been
further from the truth.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.431
[Luke] Hey, Hank.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.100
There they are!

19:45.350 --> 19:48.604
The beautiful bride and the happy groom.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.273
What?

19:51.940 --> 19:53.066
We're not married.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.401
Oh.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.945
Well, whose wedding was I just at?

20:00.407 --> 20:01.325
Hey, Hank.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.243
Mary, did you get married today?

20:03.660 --> 20:04.953
I don't think so.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.247
I gotta get that blender back.

20:11.752 --> 20:12.753
So where's my stuff?

20:13.003 --> 20:15.672
Can you just... sit down,
so we can talk for a minute?

20:15.756 --> 20:17.466
No, we got nothing to talk about.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.134
I just came to pick up my shit.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.012
Can you at least tell us
where you've been?

20:22.095 --> 20:23.722
Where you been staying, Mom?

20:24.431 --> 20:27.601
Well, as you know, I had a cozy
corner cell at the jail house,

20:27.684 --> 20:31.146
but I checked out 'cause I prefer a place
where they let me keep my shoelaces.

20:32.272 --> 20:33.106
[pool balls click]

20:33.649 --> 20:36.443
So, are you gonna give me my things, or...
is this a trap?

20:36.777 --> 20:37.611
[inhales deeply]

20:37.736 --> 20:40.489
Look, no one here is trying to force you
to do anything.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.406
It's your life.

20:41.615 --> 20:42.449
But...

20:42.532 --> 20:43.951
You know, what you're doing, you...

20:44.534 --> 20:46.536
You lost your job, you lost your home,

20:46.620 --> 20:47.913
you lost your family.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.792
I mean, Mary,
where do you think this ends?

20:51.875 --> 20:52.793
What are we doing?

20:53.627 --> 20:55.295
You left me in jail.

20:56.296 --> 20:59.549
Okay? We are way past the point
where you pretend you give a shit.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.010
You think this is
what pretending looks like?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.179
We're worried about
what's gonna happen to you.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.848
Okay, well, I'll be fine.
Don't worry about me.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.267
Don't worry about you?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.145
You're my mom.

21:13.772 --> 21:14.606
I don't...

21:14.898 --> 21:15.732
[sighs]

21:17.234 --> 21:18.652
I don't wanna see you die.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.285
Can I please just get my things?

21:28.787 --> 21:29.830
Jesus Christ.

21:30.080 --> 21:30.914
[stammers] I'm sorry.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.293
Mary.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.628
Hey. Come on.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.046
Luke, please, just...

21:40.173 --> 21:41.008
Fine.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.093
Let's go.

21:48.974 --> 21:49.808
[Beau] Hey.

21:50.225 --> 21:52.227
Hey! I heard you out there cussin'.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.355
Which is it? Colt, cows, or Lisa Neumann?

21:56.106 --> 21:56.940
Yes.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.276
What you doing?

22:00.944 --> 22:01.903
Well...

22:04.614 --> 22:06.825
Got the pictures back from Arizona.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.495
There was one of you smiling
but I didn't put it in

22:10.579 --> 22:11.788
'cause it's just fucking weird.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.708
Yeah, well, you tricked me.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.878
Instead of saying "cheese,"
you said "John Elway."

22:21.423 --> 22:23.508
I had a nice talk with Dale yesterday.

22:24.593 --> 22:25.427
Really?

22:26.303 --> 22:28.138
You remember who Dale is, right?

22:31.475 --> 22:32.851
He said that I should...

22:33.352 --> 22:34.561
stay in the present.

22:34.936 --> 22:38.273
Enjoy every moment,
which is why you gave me that album.

22:38.523 --> 22:39.441
Yep.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.778
[chuckles] And here's my favorite picture.

22:43.445 --> 22:47.157
It's the sign that says,
"You are now leaving Arizona."

22:51.036 --> 22:53.914
Did you know
that you always turn on your blinker

22:53.997 --> 22:56.083
about half a mile
before you make a turn?

22:56.666 --> 22:58.668
I've also never been rear-ended.

23:01.296 --> 23:02.923
And that every time

23:03.006 --> 23:06.009
they play the national anthem
at a football game, you tear up?

23:06.218 --> 23:09.388
If you're not moved by the fact
that our flag was still there,

23:09.471 --> 23:11.306
you're a goddamn communist.

23:15.268 --> 23:19.481
I can't believe that I ever considered
not spending the rest of my life with you.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.775
You are the most loyal,

23:22.484 --> 23:25.445
honorable, and sweetest man
I have ever met.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.363
Stop.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.740
Or I'll smile again.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.205
What are you doing?

23:39.042 --> 23:39.918
Beau Bennett...

23:42.003 --> 23:43.255
will you marry me?

23:45.590 --> 23:46.716
Are you serious?

23:48.718 --> 23:49.803
Course I will.

23:49.886 --> 23:50.762
[Joanne chuckles]

23:53.306 --> 23:55.600
[gasps, chuckles] Oh.

23:56.393 --> 23:59.062
They must be playing
the national anthem somewhere.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.315
I love you, Joanne.

24:03.066 --> 24:04.151
I love you, Beau.

24:06.486 --> 24:08.572
Know the best part about all this?

24:09.823 --> 24:11.491
Colt is now half yours.

24:18.623 --> 24:19.458
[Abby] Hey!

24:20.083 --> 24:21.751
She's out.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.504
She's always falling asleep in the car
with a bottle in her mouth.

24:24.588 --> 24:27.048
Yeah. She gets that from her daddy.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.094
At least she isn't driving.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.012
[sniggers]

24:33.221 --> 24:35.724
I don't wanna ruin the surprise...

24:35.807 --> 24:37.517
-[Abby] Ooo!
-...but I'll give you a hint

24:37.601 --> 24:39.019
-about what's for dinner.
-Oh.

24:39.519 --> 24:41.688
It's not delivery. It's...

24:47.319 --> 24:50.238
It's DiGiorno.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.616
Where's your dad?

24:53.158 --> 24:55.410
Ah. Well, him and Joanne
went out for dinner.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.787
So, you know, it's gonna be you...

24:58.371 --> 24:59.289
me,

24:59.372 --> 25:00.582
a sleeping baby,

25:01.041 --> 25:02.834
and a Saran-Wrapped TV.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.421
At halftime, I'm gonna write

25:06.505 --> 25:08.298
"I love Abby" on the field.

25:09.132 --> 25:10.008
[Abby laughs]

25:11.218 --> 25:12.636
So, it's just you and me.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.846
-And the Saran Wrap.
-Right.

25:16.097 --> 25:17.933
And the Saran Wrap's naughty cousin,

25:18.099 --> 25:19.768
aluminum foil.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.231
-I'm sorry, that's just weird.
-[laughs]

25:24.314 --> 25:26.274
I'm just, like, happy to see you.

25:26.399 --> 25:27.484
[Abby] Aw.

25:31.404 --> 25:32.656
-Err...
-Err...

25:34.366 --> 25:36.409
Err... What's the matter? You okay?

25:36.660 --> 25:37.953
Yeah. No, it...

25:39.120 --> 25:40.956
Yep, everything's fine. It's just...

25:43.291 --> 25:44.668
Oh... shit.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.340
I didn't wanna talk about this tonight,
but okay.

25:50.757 --> 25:51.633
Um...

25:55.720 --> 25:57.264
The other night was a mistake.

26:00.892 --> 26:01.726
No.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.646
It wasn't. It was great.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.692
-You said so yourself.
-Yeah, it...

26:10.151 --> 26:13.697
It was, but I'm not ready
to just jump into the way we were.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.248
Alright. [laughs sarcastically] Okay...

26:23.373 --> 26:24.833
When you gonna be ready?

26:24.916 --> 26:26.751
This... What, like, a month?

26:27.544 --> 26:28.378
A year?

26:29.170 --> 26:31.339
Hell, you got food poisoning
at Long John Silver's,

26:31.423 --> 26:32.716
we ain't never been back.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.054
I don't know.

26:38.847 --> 26:39.681
"I don't know."

26:41.641 --> 26:42.475
That's great.

26:43.226 --> 26:45.562
That's... Baby, that's so helpful.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.731
What do you want me to do, huh?

26:49.107 --> 26:50.150
[voice cracks]  I'm trying.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.443
[laughs sarcastically]

26:51.860 --> 26:53.153
No, I'm trying!

26:53.903 --> 26:56.406
And all you're doing is saying
that don't mean anything.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.783
[Peyton starts to cry]

26:58.867 --> 27:00.702
-Oh. It's on me?
-[sighing] No!

27:00.785 --> 27:03.955
What do you want me to do?
Forgive you on your schedule? Huh?

27:04.122 --> 27:05.707
I'm not the one that lied.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.293
How... How am I supposed to prove

27:08.376 --> 27:10.670
-that I'm not gonna do something?
-[Peyton screams]

27:10.754 --> 27:12.380
I could tell you
I'm not gonna lie again,

27:12.464 --> 27:14.257
but, hell, that could just be another lie.

27:14.841 --> 27:17.344
So, the only way I can prove it
is if you give me another chance.

27:17.427 --> 27:19.596
-I'm just not ready! Okay?
-[Peyton cries]

27:19.763 --> 27:22.515
I'm not ready! I can't snap my fingers
and fix everything.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.225
Yes, you can!

27:25.060 --> 27:28.271
The only reason we're not a family
is 'cause of you!

27:28.355 --> 27:29.564
So, this is my fault?

27:29.773 --> 27:31.274
Really? Fuck you!

27:31.399 --> 27:33.985
-[Peyton crying]
-Oh... That... Uh huh.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.237
-[huffing] I didn't mean...
-Uh-huh.

27:38.698 --> 27:40.075
