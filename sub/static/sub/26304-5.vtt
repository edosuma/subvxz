00:01.398 --> 00:04.295
- My husband died for nothing.

00:04.296 --> 00:05.506
Do you know
your husband's passcode

00:05.507 --> 00:08.174
to his phone?
- Of course.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.717
- Jesus.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.011
- If I were to ask
eight-year-old Matt

00:11.012 --> 00:12.845
what he really wanted,
what would he say?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.347
- I wanted to make comic books.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.432
- This is amazing.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.643
- That day Rogue died...

00:17.644 --> 00:19.060
it was the day after Christmas,
right?

00:19.061 --> 00:20.187
That was the day

00:20.188 --> 00:21.979
that he knew
he was gonna marry you.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.107
- 12-26.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.737
I think there was
a lot about him I didn't know.

00:47.339 --> 00:49.257
- Hey, I'm just running
to the grocery store.

00:49.258 --> 00:50.551
Can you let me know
if there's anything

00:50.552 --> 00:52.969
you want me to get?

00:52.970 --> 00:55.012
I hope you're having
a nice hike. Bye.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.985
So why is Raskolnikov
so concerned

01:50.986 --> 01:52.737
for his sister's safety here?

01:57.034 --> 01:59.327
Is it because Vin Diesel
told him

01:59.328 --> 02:00.953
the most important thing
is family

02:00.954 --> 02:02.288
and then drove off

02:02.289 --> 02:04.165
in a $1/2 million car?

02:05.501 --> 02:08.419
Guys, we have six weeks left.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.379
Way too early
to check out like this.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.174
I mean, come on.
Give me... give me something

02:13.175 --> 02:14.675
before the period ends.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.346
No, wait, hold up.

02:18.347 --> 02:20.890
Hold up.
How about this?

02:20.891 --> 02:23.392
Read the first six chapters,

02:23.393 --> 02:27.271
and if you're still
this bored,

02:27.272 --> 02:28.565
we'll find something
more exciting,

02:28.566 --> 02:30.483
and we'll swap out

02:30.484 --> 02:33.110
Robert Frost
for Kendrick Lamar.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.740
But you have
to really read it,

02:37.741 --> 02:39.450
or do a way better job
faking it.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.285
All right.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.746
- Hey,
I'm, uh, checking out

02:43.747 --> 02:47.041
so if there's anything
you want, let me know.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.585
Okay, I guess you're not
getting service yet.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.340
You ready?

02:54.341 --> 02:56.092
- I can't decide
what shirt to wear.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.594
- Aren't all men's shirts
the same shirt?

03:01.390 --> 03:04.517
Well, you look good
in all of these.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.310
How about this one?
This is fun.

03:09.523 --> 03:14.777
Hi.
Can you please call me back?

03:14.778 --> 03:18.281
I am starting to worry.

03:18.282 --> 03:20.116
Um...

03:20.117 --> 03:22.451
Please just give me a call
so I know you're okay.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.704
Love you. Bye.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.707
- What if art becomes
like the 24-hour news cycle?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.250
When everything
comes out quick,

03:29.251 --> 03:31.836
it has the shelf life
of a gallon of milk.

03:33.505 --> 03:34.798
What if we end up living
in a world of first drafts?

03:41.305 --> 03:44.098
- Really?
- What?

03:44.099 --> 03:45.392
- You were weird at the party,

03:45.393 --> 03:46.934
you didn't say a word
in the car ride home,

03:46.935 --> 03:48.769
and now you want to go
straight to bed.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.271
- I'm tired.
- Everyone is tired.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.606
It's Friday.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.649
You completely shut down.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.194
- Oh, because I didn't want
to laugh at Rob's jokes?

03:56.195 --> 03:57.862
He said he was so impressed
with my self-sacrifice

03:57.863 --> 03:59.488
in being a teacher.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.990
- I can't believe he gave you
a compliment.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.117
What a sociopath.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.368
- He's in finance.
It was a dig

04:03.369 --> 04:04.827
about how little I make, Leigh.

04:04.828 --> 04:08.539
- Why do you have to run
every nice thing

04:08.540 --> 04:10.625
someone says to you
through the Matt Machine

04:10.626 --> 04:12.835
to figure out
how it's secretly an insult?

04:12.836 --> 04:14.378
- Maybe because
I'm just not interested

04:14.379 --> 04:15.963
in laughing at unfunny jokes

04:15.964 --> 04:18.467
and pretending to be interested
in lame stories.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.386
- You could've stayed home
if you didn't want to go.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.932
- Yeah, really?
You would've let me stay home?

04:35.984 --> 04:38.904
- I get that you're going
through a hard time right now.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.366
I... I just thought

04:43.367 --> 04:46.202
that going out
might make you feel better.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.913
- Yeah, going out doesn't
do that for me, Leigh.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.833
- Well, sometimes,
you're...

04:51.834 --> 04:53.918
sure that you won't have fun,

04:53.919 --> 04:55.711
and then you do,

04:55.712 --> 04:59.049
and... then you're glad
you went, sometimes.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.511
But what never makes you
feel better

05:03.512 --> 05:05.972
is lying in bed all day.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.473
- You know, what also
never makes me feel better

05:07.474 --> 05:09.183
is when my wife yells at me.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.601
- I'm not yelling.

05:15.816 --> 05:16.817
- It's hard to figure out
what book

05:16.817 --> 05:18.068
might keep
my students awake

05:18.068 --> 05:19.361
when I keep getting push alerts

05:19.362 --> 05:22.363
that the world
is going to hell,

05:22.364 --> 05:24.282
and with summer coming up,

05:24.283 --> 05:26.158
I'll have even more time
to spiral out like this.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.786
- You feel like your medication
has stopped working?

05:30.330 --> 05:33.416
I have thought loops
that I can't stop, so yeah.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.084
- Happens.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.044
We've reached
the maximum dose with this one.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.755
We'll try another.
Have you tried Sertraline?

05:39.756 --> 05:41.008
- Not yet.
You know,

05:41.009 --> 05:43.009
every time I cycle
onto something new,

05:43.010 --> 05:44.969
I've... I end up crying
at dog food commercials.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.470
- You know that's temporary.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.473
I'll send the prescription
in today.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.851
Let's talk more about summer.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.228
Ideally,
what does this break look like?

05:54.229 --> 05:58.191
- Um, well, I...
I want to exercise more,

05:58.192 --> 06:01.277
uh, and meditate.
Um...

06:01.278 --> 06:03.529
And Leigh's dad and stepmom

06:03.530 --> 06:04.698
gave us this gift certificate

06:04.699 --> 06:07.617
to some... hotel
in Palm Springs.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.952
- That real life or ideal life?

06:09.953 --> 06:11.704
- Uh, both,

06:11.705 --> 06:14.290
um, though it's 110 degrees
in the summer,

06:14.291 --> 06:16.876
so probably ideal fall.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.253
Um, and I know Leigh
would love it

06:19.254 --> 06:21.631
if I finished my...
my comic book.

06:21.632 --> 06:25.510
- Leigh would love it?

06:25.511 --> 06:27.428
- I might want to finish it.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.222
Um...

06:29.223 --> 06:30.723
Yeah, I mean... you know,

06:30.724 --> 06:31.975
it's a comic
that I wanna read,

06:31.976 --> 06:33.768
so I wanna create it.

06:33.769 --> 06:36.772
- Just so you can read it?
Only you?

06:41.944 --> 06:45.112
- Oh, boy.
I...

06:45.113 --> 06:46.697
I want... I want... yeah.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.574
I want everyone to read it.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.535
Why is that so hard to say?

06:50.536 --> 06:52.662
- Say it again,
even if it's hard.

06:52.663 --> 06:55.414
- Okay, I want everyone
to read it.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.334
I want... I want everyone
to read it.

06:58.335 --> 07:01.379
Um, I...

07:01.380 --> 07:03.589
I want it to get published.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.342
I want...

07:06.343 --> 07:08.386
I wanna...
I wanna see it

07:08.387 --> 07:10.346
on my favorite shelf

07:10.347 --> 07:12.640
in my favorite
comic book store.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.851
I... I want some kid
who's like I was

07:14.852 --> 07:18.604
to pick it up and...

07:18.605 --> 07:20.899
and... and, uh...

07:23.861 --> 07:25.444
And... and love it so much

07:25.445 --> 07:27.321
they make their friends
read it.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.448
- So you'll finish it
this summer.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.034
- Uh, y... um, it's not
just finishing it,

07:32.035 --> 07:33.287
which I'm actually
pretty close to.

07:33.288 --> 07:36.539
It's... it's telling people
about it.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.876
I... I have to pitch my book

07:39.877 --> 07:42.795
with my online portfolio,
which I... I set up...

07:42.796 --> 07:44.922
last year, and you're now

07:44.923 --> 07:45.924
the second person
in the world

07:45.924 --> 07:46.967
who knows it exists,

07:46.968 --> 07:48.885
and... and if I do all that,

07:48.886 --> 07:52.930
well, what if
it gets published?

07:52.931 --> 07:55.600
- Matt...

07:55.601 --> 07:58.604
What about success
frightens you?

08:03.859 --> 08:06.068
What if it gets published,

08:06.069 --> 08:09.363
and...

08:09.364 --> 08:11.450
it doesn't make me
feel better?

08:13.410 --> 08:16.204
I mean, if...

08:16.205 --> 08:17.372
If that doesn't work,

08:17.373 --> 08:20.833
then I don't think
anything could.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.668
I just don't know
what else to try.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.754
- I think you do.

08:24.755 --> 08:25.756
I think we listed

08:25.757 --> 08:27.715
a whole bunch
of things to try.

08:44.858 --> 08:48.361
Where are you?

08:48.362 --> 08:51.822
Uh, did you forget
to charge your phone again?

08:51.823 --> 08:54.158
'Cause I got you
that new charger

08:54.159 --> 08:56.744
for your car,

08:56.745 --> 09:01.374
and, uh, here it is
on your drafting table.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.167
Cool.

09:28.026 --> 09:31.863
- Oh, my God.

09:31.864 --> 09:33.322
What time is it?

09:33.323 --> 09:34.575
I'm supposed
to teach at 8:00.

09:34.576 --> 09:36.993
- Leigh's already there.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.327
- Okay, on a scale of

09:38.328 --> 09:39.496
"We'll laugh
about this someday"

09:39.497 --> 09:41.581
to "my sister is dead to me,"

09:41.582 --> 09:42.791
how mad is she?

09:42.792 --> 09:44.709
- Uh, she was in the
"I'm not saying anything,

09:44.710 --> 09:46.752
but I'm sighing
really loudly" range.

09:46.753 --> 09:50.423
- That's not good.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.425
Whatever.

09:52.426 --> 09:53.843
She always judges people.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.344
It's like the smokescreen
she uses

09:55.345 --> 09:57.388
so that she doesn't have to
work on her own problems.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.806
- Oh, you're in trouble
right now,

09:58.807 --> 10:01.517
so I'm not gonna
agree with you.

10:01.518 --> 10:05.062
Hope whatever happened
last night was worth it.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.731
- Oh, it was.

10:06.732 --> 10:09.108
The family my friend Kristin
nannys for

10:09.109 --> 10:11.194
went out of town
for the weekend,

10:11.195 --> 10:13.446
so we raided
their wine cellar

10:13.447 --> 10:17.325
and went skinny-dipping
in their infinity pool,

10:17.326 --> 10:19.994
uh, but then Kristin
fell asleep inside the house

10:19.995 --> 10:23.080
with all of our stuff
and we were all locked outside.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.082
All I had was my phone, so...

10:25.083 --> 10:27.460
I threw an inflatable pool toy

10:27.461 --> 10:29.045
over my naked body

10:29.046 --> 10:31.088
and took a Lyft here.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.673
The Lyft driver said
that the next time

10:32.674 --> 10:33.842
anyone asks her
for her craziest story,

10:33.843 --> 10:36.261
she's going to tell mine.

10:41.183 --> 10:44.185
What?

10:44.186 --> 10:46.103
- Just think about

10:46.104 --> 10:47.356
what you could accomplish

10:47.357 --> 10:49.565
if you took all that energy
you put into partying

10:49.566 --> 10:51.776
and funneled it literally
into anything else.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.695
Thanks for the lecture, Dad,

10:54.696 --> 10:56.572
but I'm fine.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.115
I have a job,
my mom makes me pay rent...

10:58.116 --> 11:00.618
- Okay, but what
about the future?

11:00.619 --> 11:03.120
- Uh, I mean,
I think it's unstoppable,

11:03.121 --> 11:05.289
but until it comes,

11:05.290 --> 11:06.250
I'm going to continue

11:06.251 --> 11:08.000
giving Lyft drivers
their best stories.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.919
- Okay, clearly,
I'm not getting through.

11:09.920 --> 11:13.881
This is the decade
where you build your life.

11:13.882 --> 11:15.258
What do you want to build,
Jules?

11:15.259 --> 11:16.759
Who do you want to be?

11:16.760 --> 11:18.094
- Yeah, okay.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.554
I can't wait
for you to screw up,

11:19.555 --> 11:21.097
so you can call me,

11:21.098 --> 11:22.307
and I can ask you,

11:22.307 --> 11:23.517
"Who do you want to be?"

11:23.518 --> 11:25.977
but for now, I'm going
to make us some pancakes,

11:25.978 --> 11:28.896
so you can stop
questioning my life choices.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.023
Blueberry?

11:30.024 --> 11:31.482
- Okay.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.943
- Cool.

11:49.293 --> 11:51.211
- And send.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.938
Yo, bro, talk to your wife.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.024
She's, like, freaking out

12:12.024 --> 12:13.317
'cause you haven't
called her back.

12:13.318 --> 12:15.776
Text her you're okay,
so she can stop calling me.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.403
Thanks.

12:35.339 --> 12:37.798
- Hi, honey.
It's Mom.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.717
I want to get you guys
over for dinner.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.886
Can you and Leigh
do Sunday night?

12:41.887 --> 12:44.388
Let me know.
Love you.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.551
Dude, dude, dude,
you are never gonna believe

13:21.552 --> 13:23.469
what just...

13:23.470 --> 13:24.929
okay, wait, hold on.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.514
Hold on, wait.
Whoa, whoa.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.182
W-what happened?

13:31.812 --> 13:33.604
Man,

13:33.605 --> 13:35.773
she said I was too defensive,

13:35.774 --> 13:37.817
but obviously,
I'm gonna be defensive

13:37.818 --> 13:40.736
when she's always
criticizing me,

13:40.737 --> 13:41.822
and she had already
broken up with me

13:41.823 --> 13:44.156
at this point, by the way.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.909
So I'm like,

13:46.910 --> 13:49.036
"Why am I still getting
yelled at

13:49.037 --> 13:51.455
when you're already done?"

13:51.456 --> 13:52.666
- She was still yelling because

13:52.667 --> 13:55.543
she still wants to work it out
between you guys,

13:55.544 --> 13:56.919
and as long as you insist

13:56.920 --> 13:57.921
on being right
about everything,

13:57.921 --> 13:59.214
you're never gonna be
in a relationship

13:59.215 --> 14:00.548
that lasts longer
than six months.

14:00.549 --> 14:03.009
That's amazing.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.427
How does Leigh get her voice

14:04.428 --> 14:06.554
to come out of your mouth
like that?

14:06.555 --> 14:08.014
- It's not funny.
- It is.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.640
Actually, it is.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.893
- You know, Mom let you
get away with everything,

14:11.894 --> 14:14.645
and it created
unrealistic expectations

14:14.646 --> 14:17.607
for how a woman
would treat you.

14:17.608 --> 14:18.941
- You obviously got that
from therapy.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.318
- No, I get a lot from it,
actually.

14:20.319 --> 14:21.944
- Mm, maybe I can use some

14:21.945 --> 14:23.197
to help me get over
this breakup.

14:23.197 --> 14:24.489
- No, you don't need therapy
for that.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.991
Y-you're supposed to feel bad
when you get dumped.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.576
You should go to therapy
about Mom, though.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.668
You really think I have
unrealistic expectations?

14:39.421 --> 14:42.507
Man, all I want is a girl...

14:44.009 --> 14:46.511
Who will laugh really hard
at my jokes

14:46.512 --> 14:48.471
and to make me laugh
really hard back.

14:54.228 --> 14:56.854
- There was a study

14:56.855 --> 14:58.731
that looked at people

14:58.732 --> 15:00.025
who won the lottery

15:00.026 --> 15:02.610
and people
who had an accident,

15:02.611 --> 15:05.655
became paraplegics,
quadriplegics,

15:05.656 --> 15:07.698
and...

15:07.699 --> 15:09.367
pretty soon,

15:09.368 --> 15:10.619
they were about as happy

15:10.620 --> 15:12.703
as they were before the lottery

15:12.704 --> 15:16.415
or the accident,

15:16.416 --> 15:17.834
so they came up with this idea

15:17.835 --> 15:20.545
of a happiness set point.

15:20.546 --> 15:22.922
However happy you were,
no matter what happened,

15:22.923 --> 15:25.633
after a momentary spike
or dip,

15:25.634 --> 15:28.177
that's about as happy
as you'll always be.

15:30.305 --> 15:32.181
- So I'm just gonna
keep talking about Kyra,

15:32.182 --> 15:34.058
and you're
just gonna keep talking

15:34.059 --> 15:35.601
about some article you read.
- I'm saying,

15:35.602 --> 15:38.187
you're a relatively happy
person.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.772
You were happy
before you met Kyra,

15:39.773 --> 15:42.400
and you'll be happy
again soon.

15:42.401 --> 15:43.694
- Okay.

15:43.695 --> 15:46.362
Okay, thanks.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.281
- You know,
the really crazy thing is,

15:48.282 --> 15:49.782
after the study,
the lead researcher

15:49.783 --> 15:51.492
jumped off of a building.

15:54.496 --> 15:57.164
What do you think
my sober set point is?

15:57.165 --> 16:00.877
I think I should spike it soon.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.211
Good?
- Yeah.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.588
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:03.589 --> 16:05.506
- I love you, man.
- I love you, too.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.944
- I don't know why
I'm still calling you

16:26.945 --> 16:29.697
if your phone's dead,

16:29.698 --> 16:33.201
Matt, if you are ignoring me,

16:33.202 --> 16:37.288
I am going to be so pissed.

16:37.289 --> 16:39.999
Please call me.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.459
Call me, call me,
call me, call me,

16:41.460 --> 16:42.793
call me, call me,
call me, call me.

16:42.794 --> 16:43.879
Call me, call me, call me.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.838
Oh, my... wait, oh, shit,

16:45.839 --> 16:47.049
I'm getting
another call.

16:47.050 --> 16:49.800
Uh, Oh, God,
I hope this is you.

17:03.232 --> 17:05.983
- What are you doing?

17:05.984 --> 17:08.569
- I was waiting until I was
okay to drive, Leigh.

17:08.570 --> 17:11.906
- I thought
you were dead.

17:11.907 --> 17:14.492
- No, no.

17:14.493 --> 17:16.410
- You can't die.

17:16.411 --> 17:17.954
- I won't.

17:17.955 --> 17:20.331
- No, I'm... I'm, like, never.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.669
I think
I might have to someday.

17:24.670 --> 17:28.631
Just do it after me.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.717
- Okay.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.845
It's okay.

17:33.846 --> 17:35.721
Hey, hey.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.807
Hey.

17:36.808 --> 17:39.392
Hey, it's okay, I'm here.

17:55.826 --> 17:57.743
- This is
your local Rite Aid Pharmacy.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.913
Your prescription
is ready for pickup.

18:05.961 --> 18:08.087
- This is
your local Rite Aid Pharmacy.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.173
Your prescription
will be available

18:10.174 --> 18:12.717
for three more days.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.472
- This is
your local Rite Aid Pharmacy.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.766
Your prescription
has been canceled.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.852
Please call
your doctor's office.

18:22.853 --> 18:24.520
- I think that's better
than a coffee.

18:25.856 --> 18:27.858
You're welcome.

18:30.569 --> 18:32.320
- Did you cum?

18:32.321 --> 18:33.905
- Um, no, I don't think...

18:33.906 --> 18:36.116
uh, I don't think
it's gonna happen today.

18:47.586 --> 18:48.837
- Are you okay?

18:48.838 --> 18:50.505
- Yeah, I think it's just
a possible side effect

18:50.506 --> 18:52.465
of the medication
I'm taking.

18:52.466 --> 18:54.759
- You do...

18:54.760 --> 18:58.804
seem like you're...
a little better, I think.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.474
- Well, I read somewhere
that sometimes,

19:01.475 --> 19:05.437
your body feels it
before your head does.

19:14.071 --> 19:16.155
- I wish I had
a better understanding

19:16.156 --> 19:18.699
of what you're going through.
- Oh, it's hard to describe.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.035
- You're an English teacher.

19:21.036 --> 19:23.664
Give me a metaphor.
- I don't know!

19:26.375 --> 19:28.960
- I read an article

19:28.961 --> 19:31.546
that said it's like a...

19:31.547 --> 19:35.508
like a fog
descending over everything.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.428
- Like that?

19:39.429 --> 19:41.431
- Kind of.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.226
- Please just tell me

19:45.227 --> 19:48.437
if there's anything

19:48.438 --> 19:50.064
I can do to help.

19:50.065 --> 19:51.566
- Oh, yeah.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.318
- Anything.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.239
Even if it's giving you space,

19:58.240 --> 20:01.242
which, you know,
is the hardest thing

20:01.243 --> 20:04.829
you could ask me to do.

20:04.830 --> 20:08.291
But I love you that much.

20:08.292 --> 20:11.377
- That is what I need.

20:15.841 --> 20:17.675
- Then...

20:17.676 --> 20:21.679
I can start by
taking a shower,

20:21.680 --> 20:24.265
and that will buy you
ten minutes.

20:24.266 --> 20:27.059
Mm, twenty-five.

20:51.877 --> 20:53.336
- Hey, it's, uh...
it's Danny.

20:53.337 --> 20:55.505
I, uh...

20:55.506 --> 20:57.340
I do... I don't know why

20:57.341 --> 20:59.342
I even called you.
I...

20:59.343 --> 21:02.303
You're never even gonna get
this message.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.430
Yeah.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.807
I guess I just wanted
to hear your voice.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.604
This is weird.

21:11.605 --> 21:12.856
Sorry.

21:15.025 --> 21:18.027
Um...

21:18.028 --> 21:21.280
I was procrastinating
the other day

21:21.281 --> 21:23.407
and I was flipping
through my phone,

21:23.408 --> 21:27.828
and I found this old
credit card bill

21:27.829 --> 21:30.540
I hadn't paid.

21:30.541 --> 21:34.418
Um, I donated to this thing.

21:34.419 --> 21:39.715
The last male
northern white rhino was sick.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.843
And I hid the emails

21:41.844 --> 21:43.511
because I didn't want Leigh
to find out about it,

21:43.512 --> 21:46.889
and I guess I forgot to pay it.

21:46.890 --> 21:50.977
W... anyway, um...

21:50.978 --> 21:52.478
I hadn't heard
about the rhino,

21:52.479 --> 21:57.108
so I looked him up,

21:57.109 --> 22:01.404
and it turns out he died.

22:01.405 --> 22:03.448
Months ago, actually.

22:06.702 --> 22:10.246
Um...

22:10.247 --> 22:14.584
The whole world just
didn't care about him.

22:14.585 --> 22:17.003
We killed off
every single creature like him,

22:17.004 --> 22:20.923
and now he's gone.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.800
- Why don't you want Leigh
to know?

22:22.801 --> 22:24.427
- Uh, because I always donate

22:24.428 --> 22:25.803
to bummer things like that,

22:25.804 --> 22:27.972
and I shouldn't
be spending the money,

22:27.973 --> 22:30.600
and e... I'll... I'll just put
the credit card

22:30.601 --> 22:33.102
in the freezer.
- Why can't you...

22:33.103 --> 22:34.854
just tell Leigh about it?

22:34.855 --> 22:38.482
- She doesn't know
what it's really like.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.151
She thinks it's like a fog,

22:40.152 --> 22:41.278
because someone
described it like that

22:41.278 --> 22:42.154
in an article or something,

22:42.155 --> 22:45.281
but that's... that's not
how it feels to me.

22:45.282 --> 22:46.949
- What does it feel like
for you?

22:46.950 --> 22:48.826
- The opposite.

22:48.827 --> 22:51.329
It feels like a bracing wind

22:51.330 --> 22:53.289
that blows...
blows the fog away

22:53.290 --> 22:55.416
and reveals the whole truth

22:55.417 --> 23:00.087
of the world underneath,
and it's...

23:00.088 --> 23:04.008
Everyone else is in the fog.
They can't see it, but I can,

23:04.009 --> 23:07.261
and it's all ugly
and hopeless.

23:07.262 --> 23:08.930
- Is that
the depression talking?

23:08.931 --> 23:11.516
- No, no, it's me talking.

23:11.517 --> 23:13.017
- The disease

23:13.018 --> 23:14.685
makes you see the world
that way.

23:14.686 --> 23:16.479
- No, the disease
isn't dangerous

23:16.480 --> 23:17.813
because it tells me lies.

23:17.814 --> 23:22.276
The disease is dangerous
because it tells me the truth.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.530
- Matt...

23:28.659 --> 23:31.410
You have to open yourself up

23:31.411 --> 23:33.204
to the possibility

23:33.205 --> 23:35.332
that you can be happy.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.007
- I was thinking
about this time

23:45.008 --> 23:46.467
we were driving to Vegas.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.803
I was sleeping, and...

23:48.804 --> 23:52.056
you woke me up
because there was actually

23:52.057 --> 23:53.641
a tumbleweed blowing by,

23:53.642 --> 23:56.644
and you knew
it would make me laugh.

23:58.522 --> 24:00.356
And I did.

24:00.357 --> 24:02.149
I laughed so hard.
It...

24:02.150 --> 24:03.694
- Matt Greer?

24:05.153 --> 24:07.989
- Not saying
I don't... laugh anymore,

24:07.990 --> 24:11.200
but... not like you
made me laugh.

24:11.201 --> 24:12.535
- Sorry I'm late, but I swear,

24:12.536 --> 24:15.121
being an editor's like being
a firefighter on the Sun,

24:15.122 --> 24:16.497
which is why it's so nice

24:16.498 --> 24:17.999
when I get
to make someone's day.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.251
Here's the deal:

24:19.252 --> 24:20.877
You're a better writer
than artist,

24:20.878 --> 24:22.171
and there's a few key panels

24:22.172 --> 24:23.588
I want you to take
another crack at,

24:23.589 --> 24:26.048
and obviously, you gotta finish
that last chapter,

24:26.049 --> 24:28.843
but I know you can get there.
- Uh, sure.

24:28.844 --> 24:32.388
- Sorry. I'm totally
burying the lede here.

24:32.389 --> 24:34.724
We're gonna publish you.

24:36.435 --> 24:38.561
- We just gotta nail those
last few pages and I'm...

24:45.319 --> 24:47.737
Congratulations, Matt.

24:47.738 --> 24:49.530
Welcome to the club.

25:04.046 --> 25:06.047
Matt, dude.
Joe Tsang.

25:06.048 --> 25:07.257
It's been three weeks.
Where'd you go?

25:07.258 --> 25:09.550
I've been emailing you.
Hit me back.

25:17.267 --> 25:20.144
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:20.145 --> 25:21.979
- What's going on?

25:21.980 --> 25:24.315
- It's Jules.
Her car

25:24.316 --> 25:26.609
quote-unquote broke down
in Victorville,

25:26.610 --> 25:30.154
so I'm not... I'm not
gonna make it for dinner.

25:30.155 --> 25:31.948
- Uh, then don't give it
a second thought.

25:31.949 --> 25:33.699
Just go do
what you've gotta do.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.535
- You're the greatest.
I'm so sorry.

25:35.536 --> 25:36.828
I'll make it up to you
tomorrow.

25:36.829 --> 25:39.205
- No, don't... don't... I...

25:39.206 --> 25:41.082
Yeah, you better.

25:43.043 --> 25:44.877
Hey, I'll see you later, okay?

25:44.878 --> 25:48.047
- Okay, I love you.
- Yeah, love you too.

25:48.048 --> 25:49.382
Bye.

25:58.308 --> 25:59.725
- I went
for a hike today.

25:59.726 --> 26:02.103
What do you think of that?

26:02.104 --> 26:05.231
I'm at the spot where, um...

26:05.232 --> 26:07.358
Anyway, I'm looking
straight down

26:07.359 --> 26:10.278
the side of this cliff, man.
It's no joke.

26:10.279 --> 26:13.906
But I guess
you already knew that.

26:13.907 --> 26:16.325
Was it muddy up there?

26:16.326 --> 26:17.827
You never replaced
those raggedy-ass boots,

26:17.828 --> 26:19.370
did you?

26:21.790 --> 26:24.125
I'm just trying
to understand...

26:24.126 --> 26:25.252
what happened,
since you can't

26:25.253 --> 26:27.837
explain it to me.

26:27.838 --> 26:29.672
Those last few seconds

26:29.673 --> 26:32.550
on the way down,

26:32.551 --> 26:34.385
what was going
through your head?

26:41.393 --> 26:43.561
Where are you going?

26:43.562 --> 26:44.979
- I'm gonna go
for a hike.

26:44.980 --> 26:46.647
- I'm gonna come with you.

26:47.942 --> 26:50.359
Just give me ten minutes
to get ready.

26:52.154 --> 26:54.030
And three more hours
to sleep.

26:54.031 --> 26:56.032
- You were up all night.
It's okay.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.617
- Mm, okay.

26:57.618 --> 26:58.911
I love you.

26:58.911 --> 27:00.204
- I love you too.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.389
- You've done
that hike a hundred times,

27:20.390 --> 27:24.185
and I've done it with you
at least 20.

27:30.150 --> 27:31.651
I want to believe
this was an accident,

27:31.652 --> 27:33.194
but I'm standing here,
looking down,

27:33.195 --> 27:36.697
and... I just don't know.

28:13.443 --> 28:15.486
- I think I want a party.
- You do?

28:15.487 --> 28:16.904
- I do.
- A party?

28:16.905 --> 28:18.990
- Mm-hmm. Like a big party.

28:18.991 --> 28:20.992
- Okay.

28:20.993 --> 28:22.202
- Leigh, I've been trying
to give you

28:22.202 --> 28:23.370
your column back for months.

28:23.371 --> 28:27.248
- I-I know you waited on me,
and the good news is,

28:27.249 --> 28:29.083
is that I'm done
putting my life on hold

28:29.084 --> 28:30.127
and I'm ready to do this.

28:30.127 --> 28:31.170
- Are you okay?

28:31.171 --> 28:35.423
You've invited 657 people
to my house tonight.

28:35.424 --> 28:37.300
- Well, it's a last-minute
invite on a Tuesday.

28:37.301 --> 28:39.510
If 30 people show up, it's
gonna be a Christmas miracle.

28:39.511 --> 28:43.431
- No. Shit.
