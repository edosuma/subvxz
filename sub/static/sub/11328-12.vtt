00:03.234 --> 00:04.601
You would live
in the same room
as Amy?

00:04.634 --> 00:06.000
Where else would I live?
In the nursery?

00:06.033 --> 00:07.400
I made the garage
into a room for you.

00:07.434 --> 00:09.567
Why does she get
the big new room?

00:09.601 --> 00:10.734
I'm never
going to have sex again.

00:10.767 --> 00:11.868
With you.

00:11.901 --> 00:13.767
You know I care about you.
I love you, Adrian.

00:13.801 --> 00:16.000
You just tell me you love me
when you're trying to have
sex with me.

00:16.033 --> 00:17.000
I'm moving in.

00:17.033 --> 00:18.267
I love having you here, Betty.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.367
I'm never having sex,
ever again.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.133
No one will believe that.

00:22.167 --> 00:23.133
Moose is going?

00:23.167 --> 00:24.534
Your mom doesn't want a dog.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.701
So I called the guy
and told him
to pick him up.

00:26.734 --> 00:29.267
I want to look for furniture
for my room.
I'll take you.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.434
I love you, Tammy.

00:31.467 --> 00:33.567
I want you.

00:33.601 --> 00:36.901
George, I swear,
if you let anyone
take this dog away from me,

00:36.934 --> 00:38.834
you're never moving back
into this house, ever.

00:38.868 --> 00:41.734
I would never even think
about touching Ashley.
Never.

00:41.767 --> 00:42.934
I think you would
think about it.

00:42.968 --> 00:44.767
I met someone. A guy.

00:44.801 --> 00:46.801
I'd like to go
to therapy with you.
No.

00:46.834 --> 00:48.534
I think we need
to talk to someone.

00:48.567 --> 00:50.567
I thought
I wanted you and Mom
to get back together,

00:50.601 --> 00:53.701
but that means I have to
get back together with Amy,
and I really don't want to.

00:53.734 --> 00:55.000
Jeff, this is
my son Tom.

00:55.033 --> 00:56.067
You're the boyfriend?

00:56.100 --> 00:57.567
Hey, uh,

00:57.601 --> 01:00.267
when do you think
you might be coming here?

01:05.233 --> 01:08.367
Hello?

01:08.400 --> 01:10.367
It's my kitchen.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.033
It's my new kitchen.

01:13.067 --> 01:17.033
It's my new house.
I live in a house now.

01:17.067 --> 01:20.033
I got stairs,
and I've got
a living room,

01:20.067 --> 01:22.400
and I got a dining room,

01:22.434 --> 01:24.400
and I can't see it all
from here,

01:24.434 --> 01:26.400
because I live in a house.

01:26.434 --> 01:29.067
I have a house. A house.

01:29.100 --> 01:30.534
Congratulations.

01:30.567 --> 01:31.567
Thanks.

01:34.100 --> 01:35.734
Hey, I have an idea.

01:35.767 --> 01:38.634
How about we go upstairs
and check out your bedroom?

01:38.667 --> 01:41.234
How about we save that
for after therapy?

01:41.267 --> 01:43.400
I told you,
we're not going to therapy.

01:43.434 --> 01:45.133
Look, suit yourself,
but I'm going.

01:45.167 --> 01:46.167
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.400
I called your therapist

01:47.434 --> 01:48.501
and made an appointment.

01:48.534 --> 01:49.567
I'm going this afternoon.

01:49.601 --> 01:51.167
Oh, come on.
No you're not.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.667
I am, and you can
go with me if you want.

01:53.701 --> 01:54.934
No, I don't want.

01:54.968 --> 01:56.434
And you're not seeing
my therapist.

01:56.467 --> 01:57.767
No. I am.

01:57.801 --> 01:59.601
Look, I've got
my own issues to work out,

01:59.634 --> 02:02.133
and if you don't want
to be there to work out
our issues as well,

02:02.167 --> 02:03.567
then that's okay.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.701
But I'm not going
to have sex with you

02:05.734 --> 02:07.367
until I feel I have
some future with you.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.032
Or at least some possibility
we could get married some day

02:10.067 --> 02:11.501
and have our own family.

02:11.534 --> 02:12.701
That's what I want.

02:12.734 --> 02:15.133
Well, you don't always
get what you want.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.200
No, I do.

02:16.234 --> 02:19.534
You see this house? Ta-da.

02:19.567 --> 02:22.133
Adrian, I'm not kidding.
I don't want you to go
to Dr. Fields.

02:22.167 --> 02:24.300
If you want to go
to therapy, fine.

02:24.334 --> 02:26.701
But you can't go to therapy
where I go to therapy.

02:26.734 --> 02:28.133
You said he was the best.

02:28.167 --> 02:30.367
I want the best.
I deserve the best.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.033
And I deserve you.

02:32.067 --> 02:34.667
Adrian, therapy
is not what you think.
Believe me. It's hard.

02:34.701 --> 02:36.834
It's not just
talking to someone
so you can get your way.

02:36.868 --> 02:38.901
It's not just
getting someone
to agree with you.

02:38.934 --> 02:40.501
It's almost the opposite.

02:40.534 --> 02:41.801
Part of it
is getting you to see

02:41.834 --> 02:43.901
when you're not
being honest with yourself.

02:43.934 --> 02:45.067
Oh, I'm honest.

02:45.100 --> 02:46.067
I'm brutally honest.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.234
That's how I keep it real.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.667
Oh, would you look at that?

02:54.467 --> 02:57.434
You can see right into
Amy's living room
from here.

02:57.467 --> 02:58.601
Like that's brutally honest?

02:58.634 --> 02:59.934
Like you just discovered that?

02:59.968 --> 03:01.434
That's why
you bought the house.

03:01.467 --> 03:03.467
Oh. Right.

03:03.501 --> 03:04.868
Speaking of which,

03:04.901 --> 03:07.033
maybe your shrink
could figure out a way

03:07.067 --> 03:09.634
the two of us
can see John together
without Amy around.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.367
He's not Merlin.
He doesn't do magic.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.033
Nothing's
going to happen today.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.000
It's a process.
It takes a long time.

03:15.033 --> 03:16.033
It's slow.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.968
I like slow.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.834
Please, Adrian,

03:21.868 --> 03:23.667
do not do this.
Do not go to my shrink.

03:23.701 --> 03:25.734
You're just going to ruin
sex and therapy for me,

03:25.767 --> 03:27.868
and those are the two things
I care about most.

03:27.901 --> 03:30.133
Mm, you care about me?

03:30.167 --> 03:31.734
Yeah. I do.

03:31.767 --> 03:33.734
But we don't need
to talk about that
in therapy.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.868
You don't need
to talk about that
in therapy.

03:35.901 --> 03:37.334
I don't?

03:42.467 --> 03:44.200
[Ashley clears her throat]

03:44.234 --> 03:47.767
I'm so sorry.

03:47.801 --> 03:51.367
I didn't realize
you already have the keys.

03:51.400 --> 03:56.100
I was just making sure
I have everything.

03:56.133 --> 03:57.334
And I do.

03:57.367 --> 04:01.033
Okay. Uh, bye.

04:01.067 --> 04:03.367
Enjoy.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.033
Oh, and speaking of enjoying,

04:05.067 --> 04:08.067
you know the window
is not a one-way mirror.

04:08.100 --> 04:10.801
We can see everything
that's going on over here
in the kitchen,

04:10.834 --> 04:13.234
so you might want to get
some blinds or something.

04:13.267 --> 04:14.934
Maybe change the locks.

04:17.601 --> 04:19.067
Okay, bye.

04:21.067 --> 04:23.434
I'll just go. Yeah.

04:23.467 --> 04:25.033
I don't care
if anyone sees in here.

04:25.067 --> 04:26.667
Do you?
Yeah. I do.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.534
Our business
should stay our business,

04:28.567 --> 04:31.501
and my business with Amy
should stay my business
with Amy.

04:31.534 --> 04:33.033
What goes on over here
should not affect

04:33.067 --> 04:34.367
what goes on over there.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.834
It shouldn't. But it does.

04:40.834 --> 04:42.400
Da-da.

04:42.434 --> 04:44.400
Yeah, that's Daddy
all right.

04:44.434 --> 04:46.000
Da-Da.

04:46.033 --> 04:47.734
Where's Mama, John?

04:47.767 --> 04:48.767
Where's Mama?

[Ricky whistles]

05:28.834 --> 05:30.801
Howdy, neighbor.

05:30.834 --> 05:32.133
You moving in too?

05:32.167 --> 05:33.434
No.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.501
I just always wanted to say
"howdy, neighbor."

05:35.534 --> 05:36.501
Want to help me?

05:36.534 --> 05:37.767
I doubt I can help you.

05:37.801 --> 05:38.868
I need help myself.

05:38.901 --> 05:40.000
Get over here.

05:46.367 --> 05:47.334
You know there's a gate.

05:47.367 --> 05:49.100
I didn't know.

05:49.133 --> 05:50.501
So your girlfriend
getting all moved in?

05:50.534 --> 05:51.968
Yeah, but your ex-girlfriend's
flying this week,

05:52.000 --> 05:53.100
so she's not around.

05:53.133 --> 05:54.501
Who asked you?

05:54.534 --> 05:56.067
No one. Just thought
I'd let you know.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.634
Why's that?
I don't know.

05:57.667 --> 05:58.801
You do. You thought
you'd point out

05:58.834 --> 05:59.834
that I've made
a few mistakes.

05:59.868 --> 06:01.067
I was just pointing out
one mistake.

06:01.100 --> 06:02.634
I didn't know there were
a few mistakes.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.968
Why would you be
pointing out my flaws?
You have your own.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.634
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

06:07.667 --> 06:11.501
Something tells me
someone's not having sex.

06:11.534 --> 06:13.300
Too close to
the mother of your baby

06:13.334 --> 06:15.601
to maintain a relationship
with your girlfriend?

06:15.634 --> 06:17.067
No.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.434
Adrian wants a commitment.

06:18.467 --> 06:19.734
Commitment?
What kind of commitment?

06:19.767 --> 06:21.501
She wants to know
I might marry her
one day

06:21.534 --> 06:22.534
and have children with her.

06:22.567 --> 06:24.400
One day soon?
Just one day.

06:24.434 --> 06:25.767
Anything's possible, right?

06:25.801 --> 06:27.601
You could marry one day
and have children with her.

06:27.634 --> 06:28.868
Adrian's a nice girl.

06:28.901 --> 06:30.534
I'm not going to make
some promise I can't keep

06:30.567 --> 06:31.767
just so I can--
You know.

06:31.801 --> 06:33.234
Yeah, but it's
not a promise, is it?

06:33.267 --> 06:34.767
She's not looking
to get engaged.

06:34.801 --> 06:35.934
No, I don't think so.

06:35.968 --> 06:37.767
She just wants to know
there's a possibility

06:37.801 --> 06:38.767
we have some future together.

06:38.801 --> 06:40.434
Seems reasonable.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.767
Unless, of course,
you think you have
some future with Amy.

06:42.801 --> 06:44.400
Oh, no.

06:44.434 --> 06:46.434
Oh, no? What do you mean?
Amy's not good enough for you?

06:46.467 --> 06:48.601
You made it pretty clear
I'm not good enough for her.

06:48.634 --> 06:49.934
I don't want my daughter
marrying someone

06:49.968 --> 06:51.434
who's not in love with her,
and you're not.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.334
I can tell by the way
you look at her.

06:53.367 --> 06:54.767
It's not that
she's not attractive.

06:54.801 --> 06:58.234
There's just no heat.

06:58.267 --> 06:59.467
Heat, huh?

06:59.501 --> 07:01.667
Maybe if you lived
at band camp
there'd be heat.

07:01.701 --> 07:03.067
I didn't mean
for that to happen.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.400
I didn't plan it.

07:04.434 --> 07:06.400
I like Amy.
I even love Amy. I do, but--

07:06.434 --> 07:09.334
Don't say that again,
and never to her, okay?

07:09.367 --> 07:10.734
Again, it's not
that she's not attractive.

07:10.767 --> 07:11.734
Amy's really attractive, but--

07:11.767 --> 07:13.067
Let me get
the shovel out,

07:13.100 --> 07:15.234
so you can dig a deeper hole
than the one you're in.

07:15.267 --> 07:16.367
I'm sorry.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.367
Really, I don't mean

07:17.400 --> 07:18.567
to offend you or her
or anyone.

07:18.601 --> 07:20.434
I'm just trying
to figure things out.

07:20.467 --> 07:22.701
But that you got figured out,
that you and Amy have no heat.

07:22.734 --> 07:25.434
I didn't even
want to talk about Amy.
I want to talk about Adrian.

07:25.467 --> 07:26.467
What about Adrian?

07:26.501 --> 07:28.234
Did you and your wife ever--

07:28.267 --> 07:30.901
I'm not going to talk about
things I've done with my wife.

07:30.934 --> 07:33.267
I just want
to know if you went
to counseling together.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.100
Like marriage counseling.
Course not.

07:35.133 --> 07:36.767
The reason we have
such a great relationship

07:36.801 --> 07:38.267
is we haven't gotten
anyone else involved in it,

07:38.300 --> 07:39.501
other than the people
we cheated with.

07:39.534 --> 07:40.567
You're divorced.

07:40.601 --> 07:42.467
I keep forgetting.

07:42.501 --> 07:45.434
I just-- I'm so confused.

07:45.467 --> 07:47.434
How do you know
when you're with
the right person?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.100
There is no right person.
There's just a person.

07:49.133 --> 07:51.434
If that's the person
you want to be with
and have a family with,

07:51.467 --> 07:53.934
then be with that person.
If you don't, then don't
be with that person.

07:53.968 --> 07:55.334
It's not that complicated.

07:55.367 --> 07:56.767
Maybe not for you,
but for me,

07:56.801 --> 07:58.601
it's extremely complicated.

07:58.634 --> 07:59.767
You know my history.

07:59.801 --> 08:01.234
It affects everything I do.

08:01.267 --> 08:03.400
I have to think about
everything I do.

08:03.434 --> 08:05.734
I can't just be with someone
because I want to be
with them.

08:05.767 --> 08:07.734
I might not want
to be with them
three days later.

08:07.767 --> 08:09.501
Sometimes it's not even
three hours later.

08:10.300 --> 08:11.267
For me.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.901
Come on, son.

08:13.934 --> 08:15.901
You're not
that much more complicated
than the rest of us.

08:15.934 --> 08:18.934
My dad didn't abuse me.
He wasn't around
to abuse me.

08:18.968 --> 08:21.701
<i>I learned everything I know
about being a great dad
from Leave it to Beaver.</i>

08:21.734 --> 08:23.000
I just stepped it up a notch.

08:23.033 --> 08:26.400
Look,
if I haven't said this--

08:26.434 --> 08:27.868
I respect what you're doing.

08:27.901 --> 08:29.367
Trying to leave
a different legacy
for your son

08:29.400 --> 08:31.367
than the one
you were given.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.366
But?

08:32.400 --> 08:33.534
No buts about it.
I respect that.

08:33.567 --> 08:35.567
There are things
I like about you.

08:35.601 --> 08:39.634
Like that, as well as the fact
that there's no heat between
you and Amy.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.133
What don't you like about me?

08:41.167 --> 08:43.734
Your thick, gorgeous hair.

08:43.767 --> 08:46.734
I used to have hair like that
when I was young.
When I met Anne.

08:46.767 --> 08:48.734
When Anne and I
got pregnant with Amy.

08:48.767 --> 08:50.067
I never worried about
having heat with her.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.901
I worried about
being a father
to my daughter.

08:52.934 --> 08:55.467
Look where we are today.
I'm just worried about
being a father to my son.

08:55.501 --> 08:56.834
If this is
some kind of message,

08:56.868 --> 08:59.167
could you be
a little less subtle
and a lot more direct?

08:59.200 --> 09:01.934
Because I feel
just as confused
as when I came over here.

09:01.968 --> 09:03.434
Are you saying that
I should marry Amy,

09:03.467 --> 09:04.934
whether there's
any heat or not,

09:04.968 --> 09:07.934
or are you saying
I should just worry
about being a good father

09:07.968 --> 09:08.968
and be with Adrian?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.300
All I'm saying is

09:10.334 --> 09:11.801
if you don't feel obligated
to be with someone,

09:11.834 --> 09:15.033
and you still want
to be with that someone
45, 50% of the time,

09:15.067 --> 09:16.367
then you're probably
in love.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.300
There's probably
some possibility

09:18.334 --> 09:20.000
that one day,
you'll marry that person
and have children.

09:20.033 --> 09:21.100
Just tell Adrian that.

09:21.133 --> 09:22.667
Tell Adrian that?

09:22.701 --> 09:23.834
Heat lasts.

09:23.868 --> 09:25.601
Even when love is gone,
heat will still be there.

09:25.634 --> 09:28.300
You got that?

09:28.334 --> 09:29.634
I guess.

09:31.767 --> 09:36.300
Enjoy that head of hair
while you still got it.

09:36.334 --> 09:37.734
Don't flaunt it.

09:48.767 --> 09:50.067
Hey, what you got there?

09:50.100 --> 09:51.400
Wings.

09:51.434 --> 09:53.901
It's a big cooler
for little chicken wings.

09:53.934 --> 09:55.000
It's a lot of wings.

09:55.033 --> 09:56.033
Is that for me?

09:56.067 --> 09:57.267
Uh--
That's okay.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.400
Wouldn't want
to take anything

09:58.434 --> 09:59.534
that doesn't belong to me.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.000
I've done that.
It wasn't that much fun.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.000
Cheating never is.

10:02.033 --> 10:03.000
What?

10:03.067 --> 10:04.067
Someone was just
reminding me

10:04.100 --> 10:05.200
of some of my mistakes.

10:05.234 --> 10:07.834
And you bring that up because?

10:07.868 --> 10:09.534
I was thinking about it.
Now I'm thinking
about this.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.033
Why are you bringing
a barrel of wings over?

10:11.067 --> 10:13.534
I want to ask Amy
if she wanted to have
a backyard picnic.

10:13.567 --> 10:15.734
Sunday afternoon,
that's when I first proposed.

10:15.767 --> 10:18.400
It's just a romantic notion.

10:18.434 --> 10:20.501
Romantic, huh? So you two,
you're still in love?

10:20.534 --> 10:22.067
Oh, yeah.
All right, well--

10:22.100 --> 10:24.501
You're not doing anything,
are you?

10:24.534 --> 10:25.734
Doing anything?

10:25.767 --> 10:27.334
You shouldn't be doing.

10:27.367 --> 10:28.567
No.

10:28.601 --> 10:30.334
You got a funny look.
Are you doing something

10:30.367 --> 10:31.934
you shouldn't be doing
with someone besides
my daughter?

10:31.968 --> 10:33.167
What? No.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.968
Are you thinking about
doing something?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.367
What, you mean
somebody like Adrian?

10:37.400 --> 10:38.968
Adrian? Who said
anything about Adrian?

10:39.000 --> 10:42.200
I don't know
what you're getting at, sir.

10:42.234 --> 10:44.868
Sir? Okay, you tell me
right here and now
what's going on.

10:44.901 --> 10:46.100
I'm not doing anything.

10:46.133 --> 10:48.767
I'm not thinking about
doing anything.

10:48.801 --> 10:51.000
Well, maybe you ought to.

10:51.033 --> 10:54.133
Maybe you should let Amy know
you're thinking about her
that way.

10:54.167 --> 10:55.868
She's down right now
with Adrian moving in
next door.

10:55.901 --> 10:57.968
Might be good
for her ego if you
tried a little something.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.067
What?

10:59.100 --> 11:00.901
I'm not saying
you should do anything,

11:00.934 --> 11:03.334
but sometimes a woman
wants to feel like she's hot,
you know?

11:03.367 --> 11:06.000
This is a very uncomfortable
conversation.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.400
Come on, just do it.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.334
Just take some action.
Nothing serious.
Nothing offensive.

11:09.367 --> 11:11.334
Just something
that would let her know

11:11.367 --> 11:12.367
that you find her--

11:12.400 --> 11:13.901
Hot.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.000
Yeah.

11:15.033 --> 11:16.534
Mr. Juergens, are you okay?

11:16.567 --> 11:18.567
Did you have a heat stroke?

11:18.601 --> 11:21.400
Just do what I tell you.
Take it from a guy who's been
married for 17 years.

11:21.434 --> 11:22.934
You're divorced.

11:22.968 --> 11:25.567
Damn, why can't I get that
in my head?

11:25.601 --> 11:29.234
Because you and Mrs. Juergens
are having a baby together?

11:29.267 --> 11:30.567
It was a rhetorical question.

11:30.601 --> 11:31.767
Got it.

11:31.801 --> 11:36.434
Son, let me
tell you something.

11:36.467 --> 11:39.100
I'm about to become a father
for the third time in my life.

11:39.133 --> 11:42.434
I've learned a few things
over the years.

11:42.467 --> 11:43.767
When women don't want
to have sex,

11:43.801 --> 11:45.434
they still want you
to want to have sex.

11:45.467 --> 11:47.400
So want to have sex,
but don't.

11:47.434 --> 11:49.267
Got it.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.767
Thank you very much.

12:08.601 --> 12:10.234
Hey.
Why's everybody
at the back door?

12:10.267 --> 12:11.567
What happened to
the front door?

12:11.601 --> 12:13.734
There's a sign that says
"Don't ring the doorbell,

12:13.767 --> 12:14.868
don't knock, baby's sleeping."

12:14.901 --> 12:17.100
That explains it.
How are you?

12:17.133 --> 12:18.834
I'm well, thanks.
How are you?

12:18.868 --> 12:22.934
I got a lot
going on, Griffin.
Lot going on.

12:22.968 --> 12:24.934
Thought we were on
the same team.

12:24.968 --> 12:26.133
Team Ashley.

12:26.167 --> 12:29.167
Oh. Yeah, of course.
Of course.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.033
And yet last weekend,
she's standing on
the front porch,

12:31.067 --> 12:32.534
making out while
you sit idly in the car

12:32.567 --> 12:34.467
with the boyfriend's mother.
What's that all about?

12:34.501 --> 12:35.534
They're not
going to do anything

12:35.567 --> 12:37.501
on a front porch
with a spotlight on them.

12:37.534 --> 12:38.701
They're not going to do
anything anywhere,

12:38.734 --> 12:40.000
even with no light
on them.

12:40.033 --> 12:41.033
Of course they're not.

12:41.067 --> 12:44.601
I would put myself
between her and any guy.

12:44.634 --> 12:46.234
You know what I mean.

12:46.267 --> 12:48.334
I know what you mean.

12:50.434 --> 12:52.901
So what do you have
going on?

12:52.934 --> 12:55.734
You seem a little off.

12:55.767 --> 13:00.067
I got a baby coming.
I don't know if I'm
ready for him.

13:00.100 --> 13:02.334
I don't know if I'm ready
for marriage and three kids.

13:02.367 --> 13:04.367
Four, with your grandson.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.133
And I hear you have
a special needs dog.

13:08.167 --> 13:10.000
That may have been a mistake.

13:10.033 --> 13:11.868
All of this may have
been a mistake.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.133
I admit it,
not a lot of time's passed,

13:21.167 --> 13:22.801
but I'm lonely, Grace.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.501
And I had a good marriage.

13:24.534 --> 13:26.467
But I like having
a man in my life.

13:26.501 --> 13:27.501
A young man.

13:27.534 --> 13:28.834
A much younger man.

13:28.868 --> 13:30.200
Dad would not approve.

13:30.234 --> 13:32.033
If your dad was around
to give his opinion,

13:32.067 --> 13:33.367
I wouldn't be with
a young man.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.567
Your point being?

13:34.601 --> 13:36.033
That your dad's
not around.

13:36.067 --> 13:38.868
It's so embarrassing.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.367
What, that I would
be dating?

13:40.400 --> 13:41.534
Yes. You should be in mourning,

13:41.567 --> 13:44.868
not having sex with
some young, good-looking guy.

13:44.901 --> 13:46.868
He is good-looking,
isn't he?

13:46.901 --> 13:48.634
That's beside the point.

13:49.934 --> 13:51.234
Grace.

13:51.267 --> 13:53.234
Grace, don't make it
so important, honey.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.400
It's not that important.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.200
Then drop him.
I like him.

13:56.234 --> 13:58.400
I don't.
You don't even know him.

13:58.434 --> 14:00.834
That's why he's coming over,
so we can all get to know
each other.

14:00.868 --> 14:01.901
I don't want to know him.

14:01.934 --> 14:03.400
I don't want to know
anything about him.

14:03.434 --> 14:05.968
And I cannot believe
you brought him to church.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.834
Mom, of all places, church!

14:07.868 --> 14:09.734
He's Jewish.
It meant nothing to him.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.567
I don't know
what I meant by that.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.467
Everybody was staring at you.

14:14.501 --> 14:15.667
And not you?

14:15.701 --> 14:16.667
You and the minister's son?

14:16.701 --> 14:18.133
No one was staring
at you and Jack?

14:18.167 --> 14:20.467
I noticed none of
your TAG friends
would come near you.

14:20.501 --> 14:22.834
Is there a reason
for that?
No, there isn't.

14:22.868 --> 14:23.834
I'm not having sex.

14:23.868 --> 14:25.167
I'm not being shunned
by my group,

14:25.200 --> 14:26.334
if that's what you mean.

14:26.367 --> 14:29.367
Are you having sex?

14:29.400 --> 14:30.834
Are you having sex
with this guy?

14:30.868 --> 14:31.868
Grace,

14:31.901 --> 14:33.501
that's none of your business.

14:33.534 --> 14:36.200
I think it's my business
if my mother is having sex.

14:36.234 --> 14:38.367
Do you hear how ridiculous
that sounds?

14:38.400 --> 14:40.501
No, it's not ridiculous.
What's ridiculous is the fact

14:40.534 --> 14:42.000
that you brought
a guy to church

14:42.033 --> 14:43.934
that you're having sex with
that you're not married to.

14:43.968 --> 14:47.367
Hello. We're not
the only single people
in church having sex.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.601
Ah ha.

14:48.634 --> 14:49.601
If we were having sex,

14:49.634 --> 14:51.167
and we're not having sex.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.801
And when we have sex,
that's between
me and Jeff.

14:52.834 --> 14:54.100
Not you, me and Jeff.

14:54.133 --> 14:55.501
Fine. Go ahead.

14:55.534 --> 14:56.834
Have sex.

14:56.868 --> 14:58.601
But if you have sex,
I'm going to have sex.

14:58.634 --> 15:00.534
You are too young
to have sex.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.234
Oh? I think you're too old
to have sex.

15:03.267 --> 15:05.968
Too old to have sex
with Jeff.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.601
I thought you thought
I was too Christian
to have sex with Jeff.

15:08.634 --> 15:10.534
Obviously you're not
a Christian.

15:10.567 --> 15:12.067
And you?
Are you a Christian?

15:12.100 --> 15:13.934
Yes, I am a Christian.

15:13.968 --> 15:16.367
<i>I'm not having sex again
until I'm married.</i>

15:16.400 --> 15:17.400
What?

15:17.434 --> 15:18.901
You heard it here.

15:23.767 --> 15:25.167
Hi.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.834
Hi. Well,
I'll let you two talk

15:26.868 --> 15:28.434
while I go up and change.

15:28.467 --> 15:29.534
Into something younger?

15:29.567 --> 15:31.868
Yeah. And perhaps
something more
Christian.

15:31.901 --> 15:33.434
Maybe some strappy sandals.

15:36.567 --> 15:37.934
Can you believe that?

15:37.968 --> 15:39.868
My mom and her gigolo
at church?

15:39.901 --> 15:41.467
She's disgusting,
and so is he.

15:41.501 --> 15:43.334
You're not
going to have sex again
until we're married?

15:43.367 --> 15:45.033
I thought we were moving
in the other direction.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.701
I changed my mind.

15:46.734 --> 15:48.000
Maybe I can
change it back.

15:48.834 --> 15:49.834
Okay, all right.

15:49.868 --> 15:51.133
I'm fine with that.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.434
No, you're not.

15:52.467 --> 15:54.267
You would have had sex
yesterday if I'd let you.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.200
I'd have sex with you
every day if you let me.

15:56.234 --> 15:57.434
Well, I'm not
going to let you.

15:57.467 --> 15:58.968
This isn't just
your period talking?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.501
Shut up about my period.
You do not know anything
about my period.

16:01.534 --> 16:03.100
You got that?
I got it.

16:03.133 --> 16:05.133
Why are you smiling?
No reason.

16:05.167 --> 16:07.901
Maybe I should
come back in about five days,
when you're in a better mood.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.467
You think you're so clever,

16:09.501 --> 16:10.968
knowing all about
girl stuff.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.968
Hello? You thought you were
so clever, knowing about
guy stuff.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.801
Sports medicine,
groin injuries.

16:15.834 --> 16:17.968
That's a perverse choice of
medical fields for a woman,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.834
if you ask me.
Well, who asked you?
Nobody asked you,

16:20.868 --> 16:23.167
and I'll specialize
in whatever field
of medicine I want.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.067
I didn't know you want
to be a doctor.
That's great.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.701
What field are you in?
Gynecology.

16:27.734 --> 16:29.734
Knew it.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.868
She just got
her period yesterday.

16:32.901 --> 16:35.534
Yeah, I didn't think
you were buying tampons
for yourself.

16:35.567 --> 16:37.601
Oh. Right.

16:37.634 --> 16:39.534
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.868
Is it possible for a woman
to get pregnant when
she's on her period?

16:41.901 --> 16:44.200
Wow.

16:44.234 --> 16:45.701
Nice to meet you, too.
Jack, was it?

16:45.734 --> 16:48.033
Yeah. Yes, it is possible,

16:48.067 --> 16:50.868
and at 16,
when a girl's period
is still irregular,

16:50.901 --> 16:52.367
more possible,

16:52.400 --> 16:53.534
so you should definitely
be using protection

16:53.567 --> 16:54.868
and Grace should be
on birth control pills.

16:54.901 --> 16:57.367
Oh, she is.
And I always use
a condom.

16:59.167 --> 17:01.133
So what are you guys
talking about?

17:01.868 --> 17:04.067
Golf.

17:04.099 --> 17:05.067
Hey, I like your sandals.

17:05.099 --> 17:06.166
Oh, thanks.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.434
I'm going to go upstairs
and talk to Grace.

17:08.467 --> 17:10.733
I hope you have better luck
with that than I did.

17:10.767 --> 17:12.166
Me, too.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.767
So you think
they're not having sex?

17:16.800 --> 17:19.767
They're not having sex.
Grace just told me
they're not having sex.

17:19.800 --> 17:20.934
Oh, oh, oh.

17:20.968 --> 17:22.767
And we aren't
having sex either.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.800
Sh.

17:25.767 --> 17:27.099
I cannot believe
this is happening.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.734
She's lost her mind.

17:28.767 --> 17:30.067
Going out with the brother

17:30.100 --> 17:31.901
of the doctor who killed
my father in a plane crash?

17:31.934 --> 17:32.901
Who does that?

17:32.934 --> 17:34.501
And just because he's Jewish,

17:34.534 --> 17:36.234
that does not
give her an out.

17:36.267 --> 17:38.200
They don't believe
in sex before marriage
any more than we do.

17:38.234 --> 17:40.367
They have the same big ten
as Christians do.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.067
No murders, no false idols,

17:42.100 --> 17:43.734
no other gods, no gossiping,

17:43.767 --> 17:46.067
no stealing, never use
the Lord's name in vain,

17:46.100 --> 17:47.133
keep the sabbath holy,

17:47.167 --> 17:48.400
and honor
your mother and father.

17:48.434 --> 17:50.267
He is not honoring my father.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.734
She is not honoring my father.

17:51.767 --> 17:53.734
Oh, and no adultery.
How about that?

17:53.767 --> 17:57.167
No adultery.
Oh, and no coveting
your neighbor's wife.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.167
How about that?
He's coveting.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.667
Does he live around here?
What?

18:00.701 --> 18:02.334
Grace, there's probably not
a religious doctrine

18:02.367 --> 18:04.167
that encourages
sex before marriage,

18:04.200 --> 18:06.067
but people are
having sex.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.234
People of all religions.
I don't even think

18:08.267 --> 18:10.133
that atheists promote
sex before marriage, do they?

18:10.167 --> 18:11.133
What's your point?

18:11.167 --> 18:13.367
My point?

18:13.400 --> 18:15.067
I want to have sex.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.734
And we're too young
to get married.

18:16.767 --> 18:18.767
What are we
supposed to do, Jack?

18:18.801 --> 18:20.067
What are we
supposed to do?

18:20.100 --> 18:23.901
I don't know.
But here's an idea.

18:23.934 --> 18:25.033
Oral sex.

18:25.067 --> 18:26.734
It's just an idea.

18:26.767 --> 18:28.734
It's kind of a loophole.

18:28.767 --> 18:30.534
It's still sex.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.734
Not if you don't believe
it's still sex.

18:32.767 --> 18:36.434
If you don't believe that,
everybody wins.

18:43.734 --> 18:45.767
Sex is great.

18:47.667 --> 18:48.767
It is.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.268
What makes it great?

18:50.301 --> 18:51.934
He does.

18:51.967 --> 18:53.101
Okay, and me.

18:53.134 --> 18:55.600
I got to give
a lot of credit to me.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.600
I've got
a little technique.

18:57.634 --> 18:59.268
But so does he.

18:59.301 --> 19:01.734
[Dr. Fields]
Is it just the technical
aspects of the sex

19:01.767 --> 19:03.533
that make it so good?

19:03.567 --> 19:05.201
Oh, and the degree
of difficulty.

19:05.234 --> 19:08.201
I mean, we're pretty much
comfortable doing anything.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.600
[Dr. Fields]
I was talking about emotion.

19:09.634 --> 19:11.268
How do you feel
after you have sex?

19:11.301 --> 19:12.901
You want to take that one?

19:12.934 --> 19:14.400
I don't even want to be here.

19:14.433 --> 19:16.368
Okay, well,
I don't know about him,

19:16.400 --> 19:19.967
but I feel good after sex.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.934
Really good.

19:22.967 --> 19:24.467
And I sleep well, too.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.467
Although other times,

19:26.500 --> 19:29.901
it makes me feel
really energetic.

19:29.934 --> 19:31.500
And hungry.

19:31.533 --> 19:32.934
How do you feel about Ricky
after sex?

19:32.967 --> 19:34.400
Good.

19:34.433 --> 19:35.567
[Dr. Fields]
Good?
Mm-hm.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.901
Good in what way?

19:36.934 --> 19:38.334
I feel really
close to him.

19:38.368 --> 19:41.901
And I love it
when he stays around
for a little while.

19:41.934 --> 19:44.901
Other guys I've been with,
I don't care if they
stay around or not.

19:44.934 --> 19:45.967
[Dr. Fields]
That's interesting.

19:46.001 --> 19:48.234
Ricky, when you
stay around,

19:48.268 --> 19:50.634
how long do you stay around?

19:50.667 --> 19:52.901
Not overnight.
[Dr. Fields]
And why is it?

19:52.934 --> 19:55.234
You're out on your own now.
You have your own place.

19:55.268 --> 19:57.268
You don't have to report
to your mom and dad.

19:57.301 --> 19:58.901
Why don't you spend the night?

19:58.934 --> 20:00.567
Because I don't want to.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.901
Why not?

20:01.934 --> 20:03.901
Because I don't.
I like to be alone.

20:03.934 --> 20:05.700
Especially after I have sex.

20:05.734 --> 20:09.268
So Adrian would like
a little more time
with you after sex,

20:09.301 --> 20:11.467
and you'd like
to be alone.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.901
I know why Ricky
wants to be alone.

20:13.934 --> 20:16.901
But Adrian, you tell me
why you'd like a little more
time with Ricky.

20:16.934 --> 20:20.334
I don't know. I just
would like more time
with him.

20:20.368 --> 20:23.334
At what age
did you start
having sex?

20:24.067 --> 20:25.067
Why?

20:26.467 --> 20:29.034
Are you uncomfortable
answering that question?

20:29.067 --> 20:32.134
No. No.

20:32.167 --> 20:34.634
15.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.034
[Dr. Fields]
Tell me about it.

20:36.067 --> 20:39.134
Really? 'Cause I've never
told him about it.

20:39.167 --> 20:41.533
I never wanted to know.

20:41.567 --> 20:44.734
You don't have to talk
about it if you don't
want to, Adrian,

20:44.767 --> 20:46.400
but sometimes the first time
has an impact on

20:46.433 --> 20:48.234
your subsequent
sexual relationships.

20:48.268 --> 20:49.967
I was just trying
to get to know you better

20:50.001 --> 20:52.734
so I can help you with
whatever you want me
to help you with.

20:54.334 --> 20:57.967
It was with
my best friend.

20:58.001 --> 20:59.500
My neighbor Antonio.

20:59.533 --> 21:01.134
Jeeze, do I have to
hear this?

21:01.167 --> 21:03.467
You don't want to hear this,
you can step out of the room.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.934
Tell me about Antonio.

21:08.967 --> 21:09.934
Older?

21:09.967 --> 21:12.634
No. No, no.
It wasn't like that.

21:12.667 --> 21:16.301
It wasn't some older guy
talking me into having sex.

21:16.334 --> 21:19.634
Antonio and I
grew up together.

21:19.667 --> 21:23.934
We lived in the same
apartment building
for seven years.

21:23.967 --> 21:26.600
We rode the school bus
together

21:26.634 --> 21:29.934
and we hung out.

21:29.967 --> 21:34.268
We had sleepovers.

21:34.301 --> 21:35.600
We were best friends.

21:35.634 --> 21:38.101
And then, one day,

21:38.134 --> 21:40.867
he said he was moving.

21:40.901 --> 21:42.700
Just like that.

21:42.734 --> 21:46.201
So we decided
we'd do it.

21:46.234 --> 21:48.433
We always thought
we would do it.

21:48.467 --> 21:52.934
We wanted to be
each other's first.

21:52.967 --> 21:54.134
And last.

21:54.167 --> 21:56.134
We always talked about

21:56.167 --> 22:00.600
getting married
and how many children
we were going to have,

22:00.634 --> 22:03.067
where we were
going to live.

22:03.101 --> 22:06.201
We loved each other.

22:06.234 --> 22:10.201
I loved him.

22:10.234 --> 22:11.400
And he loved me.

22:11.433 --> 22:14.201
But he had to move.

22:14.234 --> 22:15.867
He didn't have
any other choice.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.433
So what happened
to him?

22:17.467 --> 22:18.600
You didn't
stay in touch?

22:18.634 --> 22:19.767
No.

22:19.800 --> 22:20.967
Because?

22:21.001 --> 22:22.967
Because it was never
going to be the same.

22:23.001 --> 22:28.034
It was a really,
really wonderful night.

22:28.067 --> 22:30.600
We went up on the roof
of the building

22:30.634 --> 22:31.867
and we took our sleeping bags,

22:31.901 --> 22:36.433
like we had done
a lot of times before.

22:36.467 --> 22:38.368
Only this time,
we zipped them up together.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.134
We listened to music

22:40.167 --> 22:44.268
and we watched the moon.

22:44.301 --> 22:48.034
It was a really, really
wonderful night.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.167
It was magic.

22:51.201 --> 22:53.134
And then it was over

22:53.167 --> 22:57.268
and he was gone.

22:57.301 --> 22:59.834
And you never
heard from him again?

22:59.867 --> 23:02.867
We agreed not to call
or write each other.

23:02.901 --> 23:04.500
There was no point.

23:05.767 --> 23:07.967
No point to staying
in touch with each other?

23:08.001 --> 23:09.234
Why is that?

23:09.268 --> 23:13.567
Because--

23:13.600 --> 23:18.167
Because he was moving
to another state
for cancer treatment.

23:18.201 --> 23:20.067
He had cancer.

23:31.268 --> 23:33.201
I told you it wasn't easy.

23:33.234 --> 23:35.934
Yeah, you told me.

23:35.967 --> 23:38.234
Would you two like
to talk to each other,
alone?

23:38.268 --> 23:39.901
Could we?

23:39.934 --> 23:40.934
Sure.

23:48.368 --> 23:51.301
So that's why
you want a commitment?

23:51.334 --> 23:54.334
You're afraid I'm just
going to leave and never
see you again.

23:57.667 --> 24:01.433
Yeah, I guess I am.

24:01.467 --> 24:06.101
Gosh, I hadn't
thought about him
in a long time.

24:06.134 --> 24:09.167
You're the first guy
I've had feelings for
since him.

24:09.201 --> 24:13.433
And with Antonio,
I don't know if
we were friends

24:13.467 --> 24:17.368
and I loved him,
but not like I love you.

24:17.400 --> 24:20.867
I guess I'm afraid that
you could just walk out
of my life, too.

24:20.901 --> 24:23.201
Sometimes there's just
no choice, Adrian.

24:23.234 --> 24:24.667
We don't know
what's going to happen.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.301
We're 17.

24:26.334 --> 24:28.567
We wouldn't know
what's going to happen
if we were 70.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.734
Right.

24:29.767 --> 24:31.901
That's why we just
have to see how it goes.

24:31.934 --> 24:33.268
There are no guarantees,
Adrian,

24:33.301 --> 24:35.500
that we're going to live
happily ever after.

24:35.533 --> 24:37.934
This is depressing.

24:37.967 --> 24:39.967
Yeah, it is.

24:40.001 --> 24:42.268
But I know what would
make you feel better.

24:42.301 --> 24:44.500
I know what would
make me feel better,
anyway.

24:44.533 --> 24:46.433
Sex.

24:46.467 --> 24:47.667
Not just sex.

24:47.700 --> 24:50.600
I'll spend the night.

24:50.634 --> 24:51.600
We'll talk.

24:51.634 --> 24:54.001
Spend the night?

24:54.034 --> 24:55.934
The whole night?

24:55.967 --> 24:57.767
It's your first night
in the house.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.201
Ruben's going to be home.

24:59.234 --> 25:00.901
We can stay
at my apartment.

25:00.934 --> 25:02.600
If you want.

25:05.767 --> 25:08.368
Aren't you ever afraid
of losing someone you love?

25:08.400 --> 25:09.600
What do you mean?

25:09.634 --> 25:12.201
Aren't you afraid
that one day,

25:12.234 --> 25:15.433
Amy will move away
and take John with her?

25:15.467 --> 25:17.368
I don't like
to think about that stuff.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.867
You better
think about that stuff,

25:18.901 --> 25:20.901
because it could happen.

25:20.934 --> 25:22.867
What if the baby
had been her mother's
boyfriend's baby

25:22.901 --> 25:26.101
and Amy moved with her mother
to that house near
her grandmother?

25:26.134 --> 25:27.201
What if that had happened?

25:27.234 --> 25:28.867
I don't like to play
what if.

25:28.901 --> 25:30.268
Ricky, you're his father.

25:30.301 --> 25:31.867
You have to think
about those things,

25:31.901 --> 25:33.368
because it could happen.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.201
She could take him away.

25:35.234 --> 25:38.634
If she does, I don't guess
there's anything I could do
but follow her.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.901
You know, there are
other things you can do.

25:44.934 --> 25:46.734
You can go to court

25:46.767 --> 25:48.234
and get your rights
to see your son

25:48.268 --> 25:50.301
established before
anything happens.

25:50.334 --> 25:52.901
You need to have some sort of
legal custody agreement

25:52.934 --> 25:55.234
before something happens,
not after something
happens.

25:55.268 --> 25:56.967
I don't want
to get into court.

25:57.001 --> 25:59.001
What if they go into
my background

25:59.034 --> 26:01.001
and decide I shouldn't
even be around my son?

26:01.034 --> 26:02.067
What happens then?

26:03.433 --> 26:05.201
I thought you didn't like
to play what if.

26:05.234 --> 26:08.234
Who would stand up
for me in court?

26:08.268 --> 26:12.201
Who would say that a boy
needs be with his father,
who was abused by his father?

26:12.234 --> 26:15.268
People who know you
and love you.

26:15.301 --> 26:17.433
People who know
what a good guy you are.

26:17.467 --> 26:20.934
People who want to help you
break the cycle of abuse

26:20.967 --> 26:22.901
and believe you can do it.

26:22.967 --> 26:24.001
I can't.

26:24.034 --> 26:25.934
I can't open the door.

26:25.967 --> 26:29.934
If she leaves, she leaves.

26:29.967 --> 26:32.533
She's not going to leave.
She's not going to take
John anywhere.

26:32.567 --> 26:35.934
I'm just saying
you have rights.

26:35.967 --> 26:38.834
I have privileges.
I don't want my privileges
taken away.

26:38.867 --> 26:40.734
Then fight
for what's yours, Ricky.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.734
Are you worried that Amy
will take John away from me,

26:43.767 --> 26:47.167
or are you worried that Amy
will take me away from you?

26:47.201 --> 26:48.567
Amy's in love with Ben,

26:48.600 --> 26:51.567
and Ben's in love with Amy.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.368
Ben would make a better father
than I would, anyway.

26:54.400 --> 26:58.167
Ben does not love John
the way you love John.

26:58.201 --> 27:00.001
You're John's father.

27:00.034 --> 27:04.001
And I'm not so sure
that Ben loves Amy.

27:05.002 --> 27:07.002
Why is that?

27:13.400 --> 27:14.901
I'm so mixed up.

27:14.934 --> 27:16.567
I love Anne. I do.
I really love her.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.901
But a baby?
What was I thinking?

27:19.934 --> 27:22.901
The girls are almost grown.
I could have been out of here
in a couple years.

27:22.934 --> 27:24.901
Not that I want out of here.
I love Anne.

27:24.934 --> 27:27.234
I already said that.

27:27.268 --> 27:29.600
It's just that
I screwed everything up.

27:29.634 --> 27:32.268
Once you cheat in a marriage,
there's no going back.

27:32.301 --> 27:34.268
A baby's not going to make
any difference.

27:34.301 --> 27:36.268
She's not going to
trust me again.

27:36.301 --> 27:38.600
I went and got her pregnant.

27:38.634 --> 27:40.934
What if she dies
in childbirth? She's old.

27:40.967 --> 27:42.268
We're both old.

27:42.301 --> 27:44.600
We're too old to be
starting over again.

27:44.634 --> 27:47.368
Jeeze. I'm a mess.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.934
[woof]

27:51.301 --> 27:52.901
Thank you for the wings.

27:52.934 --> 27:55.268
It was nice of you
to do that.

27:55.301 --> 27:57.600
It wasn't
quite the same, though.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.334
Eating in the kitchen.

27:59.368 --> 28:01.867
I was hoping we could go
somewhere more private.

28:01.901 --> 28:03.667
Somewhere where
we could talk.

28:10.533 --> 28:11.500
Talk and do this.

28:11.533 --> 28:12.533
Again.

28:15.201 --> 28:17.934
What are you doing?
My parents are home.

28:18.001 --> 28:18.967
And if they weren't home?

28:19.001 --> 28:20.368
Well, they are.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.867
I can't help it, Amy.
You get me so hot.

28:22.901 --> 28:24.467
Really?

28:24.500 --> 28:25.533
Yeah.

28:25.567 --> 28:28.533
I've tried to stay away,
but I can't.

28:28.567 --> 28:29.634
I want you.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.101
Do you?

28:31.134 --> 28:32.533
Of course I do.

28:32.567 --> 28:34.967
What happened to
you wanting to find

28:35.001 --> 28:36.567
an activity we're both
interested in,

28:36.600 --> 28:38.101
like cribbage?

28:38.134 --> 28:40.467
What happened is that
I did my best

28:40.500 --> 28:42.767
to try to distract
my desires,

28:42.800 --> 28:44.301
but I can no longer
do that.

28:44.334 --> 28:46.301
That's more like it.

28:46.334 --> 28:48.967
That's more like
the Ben I fell in love with.

28:49.001 --> 28:51.268
I love that you want me.

28:51.301 --> 28:54.500
Excuse me.
Just passing through.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.368
Hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

29:05.268 --> 29:07.234
You know what I've been
thinking about?

29:07.268 --> 29:08.934
I know what I've been
thinking about.

29:08.967 --> 29:11.101
I've been thinking about
your breasts again.

29:11.134 --> 29:13.533
I think we should
get engaged.

29:13.567 --> 29:16.268
Aren't we already
kind of engaged?
Kind of married?

29:16.301 --> 29:17.934
Yeah, but if it was official,

29:17.967 --> 29:20.101
then maybe we could
move in together
at your house

29:20.134 --> 29:21.901
until we graduate
from high school

29:21.934 --> 29:23.067
and get married.

29:23.101 --> 29:24.201
And during that time?

29:24.234 --> 29:26.533
We'd be having sex.

29:26.567 --> 29:28.001
Lots and lots of sex.

29:28.034 --> 29:31.201
Wow.

29:31.234 --> 29:34.034
Wow. I'm going to go home
and talk to my dad
about this.

29:34.067 --> 29:37.101
Not about sex,
about the other part.

29:37.134 --> 29:38.867
He already said
that you can sleep over,

29:38.901 --> 29:40.834
but this maybe could be
more serious.

29:40.867 --> 29:42.467
Kind of like
my dad and Betty.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.533
Yeah. Mm-hm.

29:44.567 --> 29:46.567
All right. I'm going to go.
I'll talk to you later.

29:52.867 --> 29:55.201
You scored, man.
This is a great room.

29:55.234 --> 29:57.201
It's like an apartment.

29:57.234 --> 29:59.201
Maybe you could
help me decorate.

29:59.234 --> 30:00.533
Why is that?
'Cause I'm gay,

30:00.567 --> 30:02.533
and gay guys are good
at decorating?

30:02.567 --> 30:04.368
No, because you're my friend.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.433
And I've seen your room.
You are good at decorating.

30:06.467 --> 30:07.867
It's a gift.

30:07.901 --> 30:09.867
Okay, we need paint.
Black paint.

30:09.901 --> 30:10.867
I'm thinking stripes.

30:10.901 --> 30:12.334
Now bear with me here.

30:12.368 --> 30:13.533
We need tape, painter's tape.

30:13.567 --> 30:15.334
Some drop cloths.

30:15.368 --> 30:17.268
We could stain the cement.

30:17.301 --> 30:19.001
Do some carpet squares.

30:19.034 --> 30:22.101
Put some small chandeliers
here and there as a contrast

30:22.134 --> 30:24.433
of low-end, high-end.

30:24.467 --> 30:28.567
I'm thinking Jacques Adnet
mixed with some Dorothy Draper.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.533
You know, masculine-feminine
mix of some sort.

30:31.567 --> 30:32.800
I have 50 bucks.

30:32.834 --> 30:34.600
Or we can buy a lamp.

30:34.634 --> 30:36.400
Yeah.

30:36.433 --> 30:37.433
Just talk to her.

30:37.467 --> 30:39.834
Talk to her?
Talk to your sister.

30:39.867 --> 30:42.368
If you two are fighting,
you're never going to
enjoy the room.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.001
You're not.

30:44.034 --> 30:46.901
Still your number one gay?

30:50.533 --> 30:51.867
I'll let myself out.

31:10.967 --> 31:12.600
Hey.

31:12.634 --> 31:13.634
Hey.

31:17.967 --> 31:19.700
Truce?

31:19.734 --> 31:21.334
Sure.

31:21.368 --> 31:23.867
Thank God we didn't
have to talk about it.

31:25.368 --> 31:27.001
Yeah.

31:27.034 --> 31:29.667
I just want to say
it's okay about the room.

31:29.700 --> 31:30.700
I don't care.

31:30.734 --> 31:33.134
You should have it.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.167
Hey, get back
in that bed. Move it.

31:43.201 --> 31:45.334
No, I just need
to move around
for a little bit.

31:45.368 --> 31:47.334
Because?
Because I'm uncomfortable.

31:47.368 --> 31:49.001
Are you uncomfortable because
the baby's shifted around?

31:49.034 --> 31:50.667
Maybe he's ready
to get out of there.

31:50.700 --> 31:51.834
No. That's not it.

31:51.867 --> 31:53.500
Do you want to go
to the doctor?

31:53.533 --> 31:56.201
No, George, I just need
to get situated.
That's all.

31:56.234 --> 31:58.201
Are you sure you're not
going into labor?

31:58.234 --> 32:00.634
How would you know
if I'm going into labor?
I don't. I'm just asking.

32:00.667 --> 32:02.634
Well, I think I would know
if I'm going into labor.

32:02.667 --> 32:04.634
I know my own body.

32:04.667 --> 32:07.234
Oh. Ow.

32:07.268 --> 32:09.301
Ow.

32:09.334 --> 32:10.967
Oh, no, George.

32:11.001 --> 32:13.301
Oh, no, I think this is it.

32:13.334 --> 32:14.967
I'll grab the suitcase
and start the car.

32:15.001 --> 32:16.634
I don't think that
we're going to have time.

32:16.667 --> 32:18.301
Moose, call 911.

32:18.334 --> 32:19.967
I'll get him.
He's in the backyard.

32:20.001 --> 32:21.767
George, don't you think
you should call 911?

32:21.800 --> 32:23.101
What's going on?
I'm not sure.

32:23.134 --> 32:24.433
I'm having the baby.

32:24.467 --> 32:25.800
Oh.

32:25.834 --> 32:27.567
Mom, breathe.
Breathe. It'll help
with the pain.

32:27.600 --> 32:28.934
Will someone
please call 911?

32:28.967 --> 32:30.634
Oh, Moose is in the backyard.

32:30.667 --> 32:31.867
Oh, I'll call them.

32:31.901 --> 32:34.500
Thank you, Ashley.

32:34.533 --> 32:35.967
I think this is really it.

32:36.001 --> 32:38.634
I think he's really--

32:38.667 --> 32:40.800
I think he's really coming.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.400
Come on. I'll drive you
to the hospital.

32:42.433 --> 32:43.400
We don't have time.

32:43.433 --> 32:45.001
I can't make it
to the hospital.

32:45.034 --> 32:47.134
Just try. Come on, lean on me.
Let's get in the car.

32:47.167 --> 32:48.667
You do not want
to have the baby here.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.533
I don't want to,
but I think I'm going to.

32:50.567 --> 32:51.967
Ow. Ow.

32:52.001 --> 32:53.167
Okay, just stay in the bed.

32:53.201 --> 32:54.967
It'll be fine.

32:55.001 --> 32:56.634
No, it won't. She needs
a doctor and nurses.

32:56.667 --> 32:58.800
Mom, do not lay down.
We have to get you
to the car.

32:58.834 --> 33:00.567
We have to get you
to the hospital.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.767
Amy, I can't.
The baby is coming
right now.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.634
We have a slight problem.

33:05.667 --> 33:08.400
Evidently, 911 says
we've cried wolf
too many times.

33:08.433 --> 33:09.867
George.

33:09.901 --> 33:12.134
Girls, get on either side
of your mother and hold
her hands.

33:12.167 --> 33:13.433
I'm going to
deliver this baby.

33:17.500 --> 33:19.301
Jeeze, this is ridiculous.

33:19.334 --> 33:20.334
Do it.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.433
George, can you
really do this?

33:25.467 --> 33:28.001
Can you really
deliver the baby
with one hand?

33:28.034 --> 33:30.734
I can do this with both hands
tied behind my back.
You just push.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.967
Come on, you guys.
Don't make me laugh.

33:35.001 --> 33:37.567
Come on, we can do this.
We can. We have to.

33:40.700 --> 33:42.268
You can't do that.

33:42.301 --> 33:43.600
I have to.

33:43.634 --> 33:45.101
You have to get engaged?

33:45.134 --> 33:46.700
I mean,
you have to get married?

33:46.734 --> 33:48.101
No, you don't.

33:48.134 --> 33:49.533
I'm afraid I do.

33:49.567 --> 33:50.600
Oh, jeeze.

33:50.634 --> 33:52.001
She's not pregnant again,
is she?

33:52.034 --> 33:54.600
No, but if
she were pregnant,

33:54.634 --> 33:56.134
could we get engaged
and married?

33:56.167 --> 33:57.268
What is this really about?

33:57.301 --> 33:59.201
Amy really wants to move
out of the house,

33:59.234 --> 34:01.867
and I really want to do
whatever Amy wants to do,

34:01.901 --> 34:04.400
because I do not
want to lose her.

34:04.433 --> 34:07.067
And you think you'll lose her
if you don't let her
move into our house.

34:07.101 --> 34:08.734
Or do you think
you're going to lose her

34:08.766 --> 34:10.234
if your friend
from Italy comes over?

34:10.268 --> 34:12.234
I have a friend
from Italy.

34:12.268 --> 34:13.500
It's no big deal.

34:13.533 --> 34:14.900
It is if you slept with her.

34:14.934 --> 34:16.268
It is if you love her.

34:16.301 --> 34:19.467
I can't love Amy
and some other girl
at the same time--

34:19.500 --> 34:20.467
Can I?

34:20.500 --> 34:21.734
No, you can't.

34:21.766 --> 34:22.867
Who do you love?

34:22.900 --> 34:24.533
Amy.

34:24.567 --> 34:25.734
I love Amy.

34:25.766 --> 34:26.766
Are you sure?

34:26.800 --> 34:28.533
No.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.634
[knocking at door]

34:30.667 --> 34:33.833
I was in the hallway
eavesdropping.

34:33.867 --> 34:35.867
Would you like
a woman's opinion on this?

34:35.900 --> 34:37.833
Yeah. I wouldn't mind.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.867
Have sex with Amy
before you decide.

34:39.900 --> 34:40.867
Hold it, hold it.

34:40.900 --> 34:42.234
I don't know
about that, Betty.

34:42.268 --> 34:44.067
What?
They're 16.

34:44.101 --> 34:45.634
Amy had a baby.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.533
They're a little young
to be having sex.

34:47.567 --> 34:50.234
Yeah, but I thought Ben
was having sex with
that girl from Italy.

34:50.268 --> 34:51.833
I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.

34:51.867 --> 34:54.234
I just thought you should
level the playing field.

34:54.268 --> 34:57.101
Then what? Have Amy
have sex with a guy
in Italy?

34:57.134 --> 35:00.634
No. Ben should have sex
with Amy and see how it goes.

35:00.667 --> 35:04.167
You shouldn't be married
to someone you're not
sexually compatible with.

35:04.201 --> 35:08.134
Believe me, it leads
to a lot of problems.

35:08.167 --> 35:11.500
But if Amy's not ready
to have sex because
she's too young,

35:11.533 --> 35:15.167
and she does have a baby,
then you should wait
until she is ready.

35:15.201 --> 35:16.368
Until you're both ready.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.867
But if the sex isn't good,

35:18.901 --> 35:20.433
you got to face the music.

35:20.467 --> 35:22.867
Is any sex not good?

35:22.901 --> 35:24.167
[both]
Oh, yeah.

35:24.201 --> 35:25.834
Sex is no good
if you're not old enough,

35:25.867 --> 35:29.368
or mature enough,
or in love enough
to make it good.

35:29.400 --> 35:30.867
Make it good?

35:30.901 --> 35:32.368
Make it well.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.433
I left my cell phone
in the car.

35:37.234 --> 35:39.067
You make it well.

35:39.101 --> 35:41.134
You do, too.

35:41.167 --> 35:43.001
I've got some news
for you.

35:43.034 --> 35:45.634
I just got off the phone
with a private investigator.

35:45.667 --> 35:47.600
I don't know how you're going
to feel about this,

35:47.634 --> 35:49.867
but they found your husband
at the bottom of
the East River.

35:49.901 --> 35:51.967
Is he dead?

35:52.001 --> 35:53.967
Yeah, Betty.
That was years ago.

35:54.001 --> 35:55.234
He's been dead
for a while.

35:58.334 --> 36:00.101
That makes me so happy.

36:00.134 --> 36:02.134
I'm happy if you're happy.

36:05.167 --> 36:06.368
Let's plan a wedding.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.533
Oh, no, we don't
have to have a wedding.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.234
We could just
run off somewhere.

36:10.268 --> 36:13.234
No. You're going to be
my wife for the rest
of my life,

36:13.268 --> 36:16.101
and I want to treat you
to the wedding of
your dreams.

36:16.134 --> 36:19.134
Well, I want to treat you
to the honeymoon of
your dreams.

36:19.167 --> 36:21.101
That's what I'm
talking about, baby.

36:31.234 --> 36:33.734
You did fine.

36:33.767 --> 36:35.034
She's fine, George.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.533
And so is the baby.

36:36.567 --> 36:38.867
You sure you don't
want to go the hospital?

36:38.901 --> 36:41.467
No. The hard part's
done, right?

36:41.500 --> 36:43.600
Right. I'll come back tonight
to check on you, though.
Okay?

36:43.634 --> 36:46.201
And I'll stay with you,
Anne, just to make sure.

36:46.234 --> 36:47.734
Thank you.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.634
That was the scariest thing
I ever had to do in my life.

36:52.667 --> 36:53.967
I'll say.

36:54.001 --> 36:55.334
I thought I'd seen it all.

36:56.901 --> 36:58.201
Nice going, everyone.

36:59.667 --> 37:00.634
Nice going, Anne.

37:00.667 --> 37:02.634
What would I have done
without you?

37:02.667 --> 37:05.301
Is it too soon to ask
what we're going
to name him?

37:05.334 --> 37:06.600
What do you want
to name him, George?

37:06.634 --> 37:08.533
Do you want to name him
after you?

37:08.567 --> 37:10.533
You delivered him.
No, I don't want
to do that.

37:10.567 --> 37:12.301
I want to name him
after someone else.

37:12.334 --> 37:13.700
Not Moose, I hope.

37:13.767 --> 37:15.268
No, not Moose.

37:15.301 --> 37:18.368
Although thank God
Moose managed to convince
the 911 operator.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.001
So who?
Yeah, who, Dad?

37:21.301 --> 37:23.368
I was thinking
maybe your dad.
Robert.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.934
Robert Scott Juergens.

37:24.967 --> 37:27.600
Really?

37:27.634 --> 37:29.567
Hi, Robert.

37:29.600 --> 37:32.301
Most people called
your grandpa Robbie.

37:32.334 --> 37:33.567
Hi, Robbie.

37:33.600 --> 37:34.734
Hi, Robbie.

37:34.767 --> 37:36.467
Robbie.

37:39.967 --> 37:41.368
Thank you, George.

37:41.400 --> 37:44.301
No. Thank you.

37:56.300 --> 37:57.834
No.

37:57.868 --> 38:01.234
You say it first.

38:01.267 --> 38:04.400
I am the champion
of sex talk.

38:04.434 --> 38:06.267
Well, good night, Tom.

38:07.834 --> 38:09.567
Oh. You still here?

38:09.601 --> 38:13.234
Oh, I'm leaving.
But just so you know,

38:13.267 --> 38:15.667
talking about sex
on the phone is illegal.

38:15.701 --> 38:18.000
Oh, yeah? Call the police.

38:18.033 --> 38:20.400
All right, look,
I had to say that.
Your mom made me.

38:20.434 --> 38:22.167
My mom knows?

38:22.200 --> 38:23.234
Moms know everything.

38:23.267 --> 38:24.968
Oh, really?
Does your mother know

38:25.000 --> 38:27.434
that you had sex
with my mother?

38:27.467 --> 38:31.534
Not only does she know that,
but she knows that I want
to marry your mom.

38:32.834 --> 38:34.334
But keep that
between you and me, okay?

38:34.367 --> 38:35.334
Marry her?

38:35.367 --> 38:37.234
Thinking about it.

38:37.267 --> 38:38.234
What do you think?

38:38.267 --> 38:40.667
I think I just
met you yesterday.

38:40.701 --> 38:42.601
Hm. Too soon?

38:42.634 --> 38:44.901
Whatever.

38:44.934 --> 38:47.934
Good night, Dad.

38:57.667 --> 38:58.801
Grace?

38:58.834 --> 39:00.601
<i>Just wanted
to say good night.</i>

39:00.634 --> 39:02.234
Good night.

39:05.467 --> 39:07.267
Good night.

39:07.300 --> 39:08.701
Are you okay?

39:08.734 --> 39:10.200
I'm fine.

39:10.234 --> 39:11.901
I take it Jack went home?

39:11.934 --> 39:13.200
Yeah. He went home.

39:13.234 --> 39:15.234
I'm breaking up with him.

39:15.267 --> 39:16.734
Oh, Grace.

39:16.767 --> 39:18.634
I am.

39:18.667 --> 39:20.133
Because?

39:20.167 --> 39:24.300
I'm just not ready for
a serious relationship
right now.

39:26.534 --> 39:28.234
That movie was so lame.

39:28.267 --> 39:29.734
And tomorrow is a school day.

39:29.767 --> 39:31.133
We have to get up
in the morning,

39:31.167 --> 39:32.701
and I'm not going
to be able to sleep.

39:32.734 --> 39:34.133
I have a text message
from Jack.

39:34.167 --> 39:35.234
What?

39:35.267 --> 39:36.400
What happened?

39:36.434 --> 39:37.767
They broke up.

39:37.801 --> 39:39.067
Jack and Grace broke up.

39:39.100 --> 39:40.100
No way.

39:40.133 --> 39:42.100
Yeah.

39:42.133 --> 39:43.234
Wow.

39:43.267 --> 39:44.767
Because of you?

39:44.801 --> 39:46.901
Well, not exactly, but...

39:48.033 --> 39:50.234
Because of oral sex.

39:50.267 --> 39:52.234
He put that
in a text message?

39:52.267 --> 39:54.200
Well, yeah.
We have a code.

39:54.234 --> 39:57.067
Someone wouldn't
break up with someone
because of that.

39:57.100 --> 39:58.701
Yeah, well,
Grace would.

39:58.734 --> 40:00.467
No. No. She had to
have found out

40:00.501 --> 40:03.467
that you two did that.

40:03.501 --> 40:04.501
Oh.

40:08.868 --> 40:10.567
What's the emergency?

40:10.601 --> 40:13.100
I think I'm going
to break up with Amy.

40:14.701 --> 40:15.667
Bologna.

40:15.701 --> 40:17.467
No, it's not that.

40:17.501 --> 40:20.167
It's just,
I'm not sure anymore.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.000
I'm not really sure
I love her.

40:22.033 --> 40:24.167
I'm not really sure
I want to have sex with her,

40:24.200 --> 40:26.667
even though I told her
I wanted to have sex
with her.

40:26.701 --> 40:29.334
I love her. I really love her.

40:29.367 --> 40:31.567
And I don't want
to hurt her.

40:31.601 --> 40:33.300
This is going to kill her.

40:33.334 --> 40:34.801
No, don't say that.

40:34.834 --> 40:36.501
Maybe she should
be with Ricky.

40:36.534 --> 40:38.300
Maybe she and Ricky
want to be together.

40:38.334 --> 40:41.501
Maybe she and Ricky
should get married
and raise their baby

40:41.534 --> 40:43.667
because honestly, I don't--

40:43.701 --> 40:44.901
I don't think I can do it.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.300
I love you, Adrian.

41:12.300 --> 41:13.701
I love you, too.

41:18.834 --> 41:20.300
John's asleep in his room.

41:20.334 --> 41:22.968
Mom and Moose are asleep
in her room.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.767
Dad is getting to know Robbie
in the living room.

41:25.801 --> 41:27.634
Sounds like a full house.

41:27.667 --> 41:30.300
What do you think
is going to happen?

41:30.334 --> 41:31.968
Think they'll ever
get married again?

41:32.000 --> 41:33.968
Think we'll ever be
a normal family again?

41:34.000 --> 41:36.501
We weren't a normal
family to start with, Amy.

41:36.534 --> 41:37.801
Yeah.

41:42.300 --> 41:46.133
I asked Ben if we could
get engaged so I could
move over there.

41:46.167 --> 41:48.834
Oh. I wondered why
you didn't care
about the room.

41:48.868 --> 41:51.601
Yeah. It's a stupid idea.
I don't know why I did that.

41:51.634 --> 41:53.968
I don't want to get engaged
and move in with Ben

41:54.000 --> 41:55.934
and get married
right out of high school.

41:55.968 --> 41:58.300
I just want to start over.

41:58.334 --> 42:00.567
I just want to start
my life all over again.

42:00.601 --> 42:01.801
Well, you can't.

42:01.834 --> 42:03.300
You just have to go on, Amy.

42:03.334 --> 42:04.868
I can't go on like this.

42:04.901 --> 42:06.634
I have to make
some changes.

42:06.667 --> 42:07.667
Like?

42:07.701 --> 42:08.667
I don't know, Ashley.

42:08.701 --> 42:10.234
I don't know.

42:10.267 --> 42:11.701
Well, that's good, Amy.

42:11.734 --> 42:14.100
I think you should
make some changes.

42:14.133 --> 42:17.033
Just 'cause you have John now
doesn't mean your life's over.

42:17.067 --> 42:20.067
It just means you have to
realize your dreams in
a different way.

42:20.100 --> 42:22.167
Get some new dreams.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.000
Dreams can change.

42:29.167 --> 42:31.601
Hey there, Robbie.
Hey there, boy.

42:31.634 --> 42:33.267
Whose boy are you, huh?

42:33.300 --> 42:34.934
Whose boy are you?

42:34.968 --> 42:36.968
Whose boy are you?

42:51.501 --> 42:21.534
Whose boy are you?
