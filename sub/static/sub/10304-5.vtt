01:20.800 --> 01:22.028
Peg.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.599
Bud.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.274
Would you get the door?
My arms are full.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.316
-Coming.
-Coming.

01:48.680 --> 01:51.114
There's no place like home.

01:51.680 --> 01:54.240
Al, if you're gonna come in,
could you shut the door?

01:54.560 --> 01:57.393
Peg, if you're gonna live here,
could you shut your mouth?

01:59.160 --> 02:01.958
You know, Peg, this dog is chewing
a hole in our budget.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.079
Look at these.
Kibbles, dog biscuits, Liver Snaps.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.710
Well, actually, Al, those are for Mom.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.276
Oh, why didn't you say so?

02:22.840 --> 02:26.799
Oh, food.
An escape from this hellhole.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.593
Bud, you're in college.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.752
l mean, you don't go to parties
or get laid or anything...

02:34.520 --> 02:36.556
...but you did take classes, right?

02:36.760 --> 02:39.718
-ls there a point to this barrage, Dad?
-ls there?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.315
Oh, that's right, you're smart.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.115
Where the hell is
my paycheck going?

02:45.360 --> 02:49.035
Luckily, Dad, l've put all the family
finances right here in this computer.

02:49.280 --> 02:53.273
You put something l don't have
into something l don't understand.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.237
You know, that reminds me
of our sex life.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.351
That's putting something l have
in something l don't like.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.593
Dad, look.

03:11.800 --> 03:16.237
Look, here's a list of all the salaries
of all the occupations in the world.

03:16.480 --> 03:20.155
And here is what you make.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.513
That's what l make?

03:23.760 --> 03:26.069
l'm a paperboy.

03:26.960 --> 03:31.192
Oh, no, Al, paperboys
can afford bicycles.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.671
There must be someone out there
that makes less than l do.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.675
Mom, Dad, Bud.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.235
You'll never guess what l got.

03:47.880 --> 03:50.838
A better game would be
Guess What You Haven't Got.

03:52.160 --> 03:55.311
l'll take Virginity for $100.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.993
Oh, that's funny. Nobody will take
yours for less than a thousand.

04:02.760 --> 04:06.958
Anyway, l got a part in a TV movie.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.639
Who are you gonna play, honey?

04:09.120 --> 04:11.236
Madame Curie.

04:11.880 --> 04:15.077
To prepare for the part, l thought
l'd get some firsthand experience...

04:15.280 --> 04:16.838
...of what it's like to be Madame.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.507
Does anyone know where there's
a brothel around here?

04:21.160 --> 04:24.072
Well, there's Howie's down by
the airport but-

04:32.800 --> 04:36.076
l mean, Madame Curie's
not a hooker.

04:36.320 --> 04:39.073
No, she's a famous French chemist
who discovered radium...

04:39.320 --> 04:41.675
...down by the airport.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.434
Now, what am l gonna do?

04:44.680 --> 04:46.796
l still have to research
Madame Curie...

04:47.000 --> 04:49.514
...but l don't know anything
about "science."

04:53.400 --> 04:57.712
Kel, that's science, not "science".
The C is silent.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.358
l knew l should have stayed in...

05:00.600 --> 05:02.192
...shool.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.751
Look, Bud, you're my manager.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.197
Please do something to earn
your 75 percent.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.513
Peg, come here.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.917
A Pakistani dirt vendor makes
more than l do.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.471
Yeah, and he probably smells better.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.836
Probably has reason to.

05:29.920 --> 05:30.989
l got it, Kel. l got it.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.953
l'll set you up with this scientist
l know at the university.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.957
All you do,
pretend you're a professor.

05:36.200 --> 05:39.590
Okay, but, l mean, l think l'd make a
more convincing Ginger or Mary Ann...

05:39.800 --> 05:41.119
...don't you think?

05:48.720 --> 05:51.996
You must be the new professor.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.515
You must be Gilligan. Hi.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.311
Kelly Bundy at your service.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.677
So Bud tells me you're in aerospace.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.592
Yeah, well...

06:03.080 --> 06:05.878
...it's not rocket science,
but what is?

06:07.520 --> 06:10.114
Right. So what are you
working on now?

06:10.560 --> 06:13.677
Well, l just received a grant
from the Crayola company...

06:15.480 --> 06:17.072
...to invent a new colour.

06:17.320 --> 06:18.514
Bleen.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.034
Bleen?

06:20.280 --> 06:22.510
ls that a mixture of blue and green?

06:22.760 --> 06:25.115
No, of blood and spleen.

06:26.400 --> 06:30.109
You know, it's for the kids
who wanna draw accidents. Yeah.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.989
Really? You would think that Crayola
would have enough colours already.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.157
Well, not anymore.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.233
See, they had to get rid
of black and white...

06:39.440 --> 06:42.591
...you know, to be politically correct.

06:42.840 --> 06:45.593
They were gonna mix the two together
and call it blite...

06:45.800 --> 06:51.557
...but the guy who invented grey
back in '74 threatened to sue, so...

06:51.880 --> 06:53.518
All right.

06:53.760 --> 06:54.988
So, what's your field?

06:55.600 --> 06:58.637
-Alchogorentology.
-Oh, right.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.959
What's alchorathincology?

07:02.480 --> 07:05.074
lt's a study of that age-old question:

07:05.320 --> 07:10.394
How much booze can a rat drink
before he explodes?

07:11.240 --> 07:13.879
-Kennedy grant?
-Exactly.

07:16.920 --> 07:20.310
Now, this is your
lab station, right here.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.993
Oh, great.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.755
Just like a smaller version
of the one l have at home.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.195
That reminds me.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.153
Make sure you take all your findings
with you when you leave.

07:30.360 --> 07:33.397
After all, this is academia.
Thievery runs rampant here.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.149
l think l'm gonna like science.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.914
lt's like shopping at the mall.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.359
All right.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.717
Now, here's someone who might
make less than your father.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.679
Eskimo blubber-chewer.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.599
Nope.

07:59.960 --> 08:03.270
Check French deodorant salesman.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.394
Not even close.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.152
Hey, guys.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.716
Today was my last day at the lab.

08:18.960 --> 08:22.157
lt's a good thing too, because there
was nothing left to take.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.309
But you know what?
l really got into my character.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.714
And just like Madame Curie...

08:27.920 --> 08:30.434
...l threw a bunch of cool,
deadly chemicals together...

08:30.640 --> 08:33.996
...and l invented something.
The colour bleen.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.918
Mom, check brain-dead blond.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.310
They make way more
than your father.

08:48.840 --> 08:52.799
Kelly, where exactly
is this colour bleen now?

08:53.040 --> 08:56.669
Well, since it's a level three
biohazard...

08:56.920 --> 08:58.797
...l had to put it where nobody
would go.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.877
So l put it in Dad's shower.

09:09.120 --> 09:13.318
You know, l never thought l'd say it,
but l really enjoyed that shower.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.756
You didn't wash your hair,
did you, Daddy?

09:17.320 --> 09:18.594
No, l'm wearing this towel...

09:18.800 --> 09:21.519
...because l wanna get a job
as a New York City cabby.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.029
You didn't use the bottle marked
" Bleen," did you?

09:27.280 --> 09:28.918
Sure did.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.910
lt's great. lt tingles.
lt's just like the commercial says.

09:33.160 --> 09:36.311
My whole scalp feels alive.

09:37.080 --> 09:43.189
Honey, when you only bathe once
every two months, your scalp is alive.

09:44.760 --> 09:47.558
Daddy, Bleen is not a shampoo.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.872
lt's a bunch of deadly chemicals
that l mixed together at the lab.

09:51.120 --> 09:55.352
lt's possible that this tingling you're
feeling could be a massive stroke.

09:58.680 --> 10:01.069
Either way, l thank you.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.589
l love Bleen.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.279
What?

10:26.400 --> 10:27.992
How do l look?

10:35.520 --> 10:38.830
Jumping Jehoshaphat, l'm a hunk!

10:40.080 --> 10:41.672
l'm a dude.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.388
l'm a hunky dude!

10:57.800 --> 11:00.758
Don't hate me because l'm beautiful.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.516
Wow, Al, you have hair.

11:06.760 --> 11:09.069
-How did that happen?
-Who cares?

11:09.400 --> 11:12.278
All l know is that Kelly's Bleen
has grown...

11:12.480 --> 11:16.075
...what 25 years of you
has withered away.

11:18.600 --> 11:21.558
Kelly, man has been seeking
the cure for baldness...

11:21.760 --> 11:24.797
...since the invention
of the younger woman.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.632
This may make me rich!

11:27.520 --> 11:29.875
But don't you mean make us rich?

11:30.120 --> 11:31.792
No.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.077
Well, it's Kelly's formula,
so l gotta cut her in, of course...

11:35.320 --> 11:38.153
...but the rest of you mean
absolutely nothing to me.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.948
Now, wait a sec, now,
l'm Kelly's manager.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.270
l get 75 percent
of whatever she gets.

11:43.480 --> 11:46.040
Kelly, listen very, very carefully
to Daddy.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.629
Number one, Bud is fired.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.430
Number two, do you remember
how to make Bleen?

11:53.680 --> 11:56.148
And can you make lots and lots
for Daddy?

11:56.360 --> 11:58.715
-Yeah.
-Oh, sweetheart!

12:00.080 --> 12:04.119
lf you can make Daddy some Bleen,
l'll buy you an acting career.

12:04.320 --> 12:07.153
You'll be the next Tori Spelling.

12:08.320 --> 12:12.108
Okay. But prettier, right?

12:13.400 --> 12:17.029
-Hell, Two-Face is prettier.
-Oh, l know.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.232
Sweetheart, if you're going out,
would you get me some mousse...

12:20.440 --> 12:23.113
-...and a scrunchie?
-Okay, Daddy.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.239
You won't get away with this, Pop.
l'll sue.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.710
Sue away.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.671
You get in line
behind Sy Sperling...

12:31.880 --> 12:34.997
...and his soon-to-be-defunct
Hair Club for Men.

12:36.560 --> 12:40.792
Because when this comes out,
l'm gonna be one hairy millionaire.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.470
Hey, Al, what about side effects?

12:43.720 --> 12:46.553
You know, no one markets
a product without testing it.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.677
Oh, no, Peg?

12:49.200 --> 12:50.792
Cigarettes...

12:51.920 --> 12:53.990
...Ford Pinto...

12:55.040 --> 12:58.112
...that condom l used
on our wedding night.

12:59.760 --> 13:04.117
Read my lips, Peg.
There are no side effects.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.590
Okay, all right.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.308
By the way, Peg, you look really good
this afternoon.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.999
Who said that?

13:12.880 --> 13:17.476
Al, that is the nicest thing
you've said to me in years.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.109
You know, l have a sudden urge
to take you upstairs...

13:20.320 --> 13:22.959
...and have sex with you-
Who said that?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.195
Well, let's go.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.318
Wait a second, Peg. Wait,
l better test this Bleen a little bit.

13:29.520 --> 13:32.159
Wait a minute, Peg. Wait, wait.
God, you look beautiful.

13:32.360 --> 13:37.434
Who the hell said that?
Oh, my God, somebody shoot me!

13:41.880 --> 13:45.919
l now call this meeting of No Ma'am
to order, to announce the results...

13:46.120 --> 13:49.715
...of the final tests
of Al Bundy's Bleen.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.914
l mean, Kelly and Al Bundy's Bleen.

13:54.160 --> 13:58.551
l now give you my wonderful daughter,
whom l love more than anything.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.751
Thank you, Daddy.

14:01.240 --> 14:05.836
Now, placebos were given
to the first group, group A.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.514
Things to do:

14:08.720 --> 14:09.755
Make will.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.916
Cut family out of will.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.957
Make tender love to wife,
with lights on.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.513
What?

14:16.840 --> 14:21.231
Now, as you can see
in the first group...

14:21.480 --> 14:24.040
...there's been no hair growth at all.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.431
By the way,
what was that placebo we took?

14:27.680 --> 14:31.229
Birth control pills.
You're both dismissed.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.638
Hey, is it just me, or are your breasts
getting bigger too?

14:38.880 --> 14:42.953
No, but l have switched to Lightdays.

14:44.520 --> 14:49.116
Now, everybody in group B
took Bleen.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.958
Solid.

15:09.720 --> 15:13.110
And the Bleen has worked
in every case.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.999
l think the evidence
speaks for itself.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.070
Kelly, go inside and alert the media.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.714
Particularly those
with receding hairlines.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.751
David Brinkley, Willard Scott...

15:27.000 --> 15:28.752
...Barbara Walters.

15:31.520 --> 15:37.993
Guys, am l the only one in the Bleen
group who's had this horrible urge...

15:38.240 --> 15:41.232
...to do the girlfriend thing
with the wife?

15:41.480 --> 15:43.914
Oh, thank God l'm not alone.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.720
l carried the wife
across the threshold.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.155
l told her that l loved her.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.630
l even had foreplay.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.315
Hey, so what?

15:54.520 --> 15:58.957
Last night l pleasured my ex-wife
and paid her back alimony.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.273
Yeah, well, that's nothing.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.038
When l was making love to Marcie...

16:04.360 --> 16:06.954
...l was fantasizing about...

16:07.200 --> 16:09.475
-...Marcie.
-Oh, man, that's sick!

16:09.720 --> 16:12.553
Settle, settle. Gentlemen!

16:13.880 --> 16:16.758
Gentlemen, we are on the horns
of a dilemma.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.629
By marketing Bleen,
we'll make millions.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.711
Well, l will.

16:23.080 --> 16:27.232
But we'll also be condemning mankind
to a lifetime of lights-on...

16:27.440 --> 16:30.830
...bags-off, wife-pleasing sex.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.828
Okay, then it's settled.
We can't sell Bleen.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.516
We'd be as hated as the guy
who invented the G-spot.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.035
Hey, who was that guy?

16:42.400 --> 16:44.550
l don't know. Kenny G?

16:47.080 --> 16:49.230
Al, we gotta do something.

16:49.480 --> 16:52.916
l mean, No Ma'am is turning
into Yes Ma'am.

16:53.160 --> 16:57.233
He's right. l don't know how many
more times l can sex the ex.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.192
Well...

17:01.360 --> 17:03.316
...Kelly invented Bleen...

17:03.560 --> 17:05.516
... maybe she can also invent
an antidote.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.715
But she's gonna need a guinea pig.

17:07.960 --> 17:08.915
No problem.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.997
l'll take full responsibility.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.310
A Bundy got you into this...

17:13.560 --> 17:15.152
...a Bundy will get you out.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.674
Okay, Bud, l think l found
the antidote.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.115
Are you ready for the last test?

19:04.800 --> 19:07.598
Hell, l'm ready for the last rites.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.030
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.196
l want you, Bud.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.478
What for?

19:27.320 --> 19:30.551
lt worked! The antidote worked.
lt worked. lt worked.

19:32.520 --> 19:35.398
There's gotta be someone out there
even more worthless than me.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.074
Yeah, well, l'd like to meet him.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.838
Well, here it is, Peg.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.479
Occupation, none.

19:42.720 --> 19:43.869
Skill, none.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.314
Use, none.

19:45.560 --> 19:50.076
Peg, say hi to Public Loafer
Number 1.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.791
How you doing, son? How are you-?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.793
-How are you feeling?
-Oh, just great, Dad.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.156
Yeah, trying to find the cure
for Bleen...

20:13.360 --> 20:17.911
...turned me into a bitter, sexless,
aging loser.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.590
l might as well sell women's shoes.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.868
Come on, Dad.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.350
You gotta help me.
l can't stay like this forever.

20:28.600 --> 20:33.037
Son, l- Yeah, l mean to tell you
something here.

20:35.480 --> 20:36.993
See, son, l-

20:37.240 --> 20:39.629
l still have some Bleen.

20:39.880 --> 20:42.235
Yeah, l saved it, you know,
in case your mother...

20:42.440 --> 20:46.911
...should accidentally tie herself up to
a railroad track and l'd be single again.

20:48.720 --> 20:52.713
But since she'd probably just
derail the train, l-

20:53.880 --> 20:57.156
l'm happy to give it to you.
lt's upstairs in my shower.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.790
Thanks, Dad. l'll just run up
and go get it.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.516
That Bleen made me so horny...

21:10.760 --> 21:13.877
...I'm gonna rent me 101 dalmatians.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.549
And I don't mean the movie.

21:22.160 --> 21:25.550
Hey, you guys, it's starting.
My Madame Curie is on.

21:25.760 --> 21:28.593
-Oh, what channel is it on, honey?
-Fox.

21:28.840 --> 21:31.752
Assume Fox-viewing positions.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.279
And now, from the mak ers of.

21:42.480 --> 21:47.600
Buttafuoco: Misunderstood
Family Man or Giant, Fat Sleazoid?...

21:47.800 --> 21:49.028
... we proudly present.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.789
Madame Curie:
Misunderstood Scientist...

21:53.000 --> 21:55.389
...or Syph-Ridden Whoremonger?

21:58.280 --> 22:00.999
Sailor, is that radium
in your pock et...

22:01.240 --> 22:03.754
... or are you just happy to see me?
