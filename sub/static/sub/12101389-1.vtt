05:09.857 --> 05:13.328
My love, my love.

05:13.461 --> 05:18.099
Hey, hey, hey.

05:18.232 --> 05:22.004
We've had an amazing,
an amazing life together.

05:23.672 --> 05:26.340
I wouldn't trade it
for anything in this world.

05:26.473 --> 05:27.408
Okay?

05:27.542 --> 05:30.310
But what...
what did we always say?

05:30.444 --> 05:33.915
I don't...
I don't know anything any more.

05:34.047 --> 05:36.184
Hey, Jim...

05:36.317 --> 05:37.885
Jim...

05:38.018 --> 05:39.855
James, please, I...

05:39.989 --> 05:42.858
I need you accept this...
I don't...

05:42.992 --> 05:45.059
I don't want this to be
how it ends, okay?

05:45.192 --> 05:48.563
I can't... I can't leave this
place knowing that

05:48.696 --> 05:51.966
you and the girls
are not going to be okay.

05:53.701 --> 05:54.769
I need you to be strong.

05:54.903 --> 05:57.806
I need you
to be the rock!

06:04.980 --> 06:07.648
I can do this.

06:07.783 --> 06:09.050
For you, I can do this.

06:14.855 --> 06:17.425
I'll never love anybody the way
that I've loved you.

06:17.559 --> 06:19.059
God damn
right you won't.

06:34.408 --> 06:36.077
Okay.

06:37.912 --> 06:40.682
I think I'm ready,
okay?

06:42.184 --> 06:44.586
You can bring the girls in.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.122
Okay.

07:12.747 --> 07:14.615
Randy...

07:17.251 --> 07:18.586
...I'm going to have
to lean on you

07:18.720 --> 07:20.588
to take care
of these two, okay?

07:24.292 --> 07:28.095
You have always been amazing
at getting them

07:28.230 --> 07:30.831
to see each other's side.

07:30.965 --> 07:33.001
Mm?

07:33.134 --> 07:34.468
I don't want to
leave this world

07:34.602 --> 07:37.239
worried that these two
are going to drift apart.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.675
I'll take care
of the old man.

07:40.809 --> 07:43.145
Okay.
Stank-breath.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.516
Your word?

07:48.650 --> 07:49.650
My word.

07:57.025 --> 07:59.395
Staci...

08:01.795 --> 08:04.365
...you are smart,

08:04.499 --> 08:08.203
you are beautiful...

08:08.336 --> 08:10.571
...and you are
ready to bloom.

08:50.145 --> 08:52.079
You took off
pretty quickly.

08:59.721 --> 09:02.157
It's not her.

09:02.290 --> 09:06.527
It's just the shell
she left behind.

09:06.661 --> 09:09.631
I know you're having
a tough time with this.

09:10.998 --> 09:14.768
And I know you are not exactly
thrilled about the move.

09:14.901 --> 09:16.604
Tough time?

09:18.740 --> 09:21.777
Why wouldn't I be?

09:21.910 --> 09:23.612
She died.

09:25.679 --> 09:28.315
And you just want to what?

09:28.449 --> 09:31.419
Pack up and move?!

09:31.551 --> 09:35.756
Like that's going to be
some remedy for her death?

09:37.659 --> 09:39.628
It's just... think
it's best for all of us.

09:39.761 --> 09:40.963
Bullshit!

09:41.096 --> 09:42.230
Don't say that!

09:42.363 --> 09:43.598
It's for you!

09:43.732 --> 09:46.434
Don't pretend
like it's for us!

09:46.568 --> 09:48.535
At least own up to that.

09:48.670 --> 09:51.205
What, do you think that you
are the only one who lost her?!

09:52.808 --> 09:54.809
I know you are
having a tough time with this.

09:54.943 --> 09:58.179
And I know your relationship
with her was very special.

09:58.313 --> 10:00.816
And I wish I could say that
everything is going to be okay,

10:00.949 --> 10:02.516
and that would give you
some sort of comfort.

10:02.650 --> 10:03.818
But the fact
of the matter...

10:03.952 --> 10:06.388
the fact of the matter is
I can't.

10:08.256 --> 10:10.891
She's dead. She died.

10:11.025 --> 10:12.360
Slowly, and painfully,

10:12.493 --> 10:15.163
and there was nothing
we could do about it.

10:17.431 --> 10:20.268
All we got to do
is sit back and watch.

10:22.971 --> 10:25.974
So guess what, kid...

10:26.107 --> 10:27.543
it's never
going to be okay.

10:29.209 --> 10:30.679
Fuck you!

10:31.913 --> 10:34.016
Fuck you!

10:34.149 --> 10:35.517
Great pep talk.

10:35.650 --> 10:37.285
You've really got
a way with words.

11:38.545 --> 11:40.515
So, how did it go?

11:40.647 --> 11:44.719
Oh, thank you,
you are a Godsend. Mm.

11:44.852 --> 11:45.853
Does that mean?

11:45.987 --> 11:48.490
Yep, closed the Mitchell's
this morning.

11:48.622 --> 11:49.925
Hung the sold sign
about an hour ago.

11:50.058 --> 11:52.193
Ugh, You bitch.
How many is that this month?

11:52.325 --> 11:53.593
Five?
Six.

11:53.727 --> 11:54.862
Six?
Yeah, because

11:54.997 --> 11:57.299
the Gilroy's
closed last night, so...

11:57.431 --> 11:58.765
Did you hear they upped
the commission

11:58.900 --> 12:01.135
to 15% on
the Wilford Lane property?

12:01.269 --> 12:02.770
But of course
I fucking did!

12:02.904 --> 12:04.539
Um, will you be a doll, and grab
the rest of these markers

12:04.673 --> 12:06.074
out of the trunk for me,
bring them in?

12:06.207 --> 12:07.476
Thank you!

12:20.454 --> 12:22.790
Good morning.
Oh, hi.

12:22.924 --> 12:24.257
Hi.

12:24.391 --> 12:26.994
Um, I don't think I've ever
seen you around town before.

12:27.127 --> 12:29.131
I pretty much
know everybody, so...

12:29.264 --> 12:32.700
either you're a tourist
or a future resident?

12:32.833 --> 12:35.136
A future resident
hopefully.

12:35.270 --> 12:36.371
Amazing!
Hi, I'm...

12:36.505 --> 12:38.573
Oh...
Thank you.

12:38.705 --> 12:40.207
I'm Austyn Becker.

12:40.341 --> 12:43.376
Hi, uh,
James Van Patton...

12:43.511 --> 12:44.978
Jim.
Jim, hi.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.580
Hi.

12:46.714 --> 12:48.615
So, how is your day
looking today?

12:48.750 --> 12:52.020
You want to maybe potentially
go find your dream home?

12:52.152 --> 12:55.223
Or...

12:55.357 --> 12:56.324
Yeah.
Yeah?

12:56.457 --> 12:58.059
Yeah! I'm game.

12:59.960 --> 13:04.164
Ah, I think we're getting
a little out of my price range.

13:04.298 --> 13:06.668
We looked at a lot of
good options today, but, um...

13:06.801 --> 13:09.103
I just have one more house
on the list.

13:09.237 --> 13:11.339
Consider it
a cherry on top.

13:30.857 --> 13:32.493
So, the house
has six bedrooms,

13:32.626 --> 13:36.897
a study, a pool outback
with waterfalls,

13:37.031 --> 13:40.535
a sauna, state of
the art security system,

13:40.668 --> 13:42.938
and if you ever feel like
you're getting too cramped,

13:43.070 --> 13:46.306
there is also a casita on the
far east end of the property.

13:46.439 --> 13:48.208
A casita
on the east end?

13:50.844 --> 13:54.949
Look, this was a fun peak seeing
how the wealthy live, but...

13:55.083 --> 13:58.685
I can't afford this. Well, that's up
to me and the bank, don't you think?

13:58.819 --> 14:01.122
No, it's up
to my bank account.

14:01.255 --> 14:05.226
Wait, hold on. How much do
you think this house is worth?

14:05.358 --> 14:06.560
I don't know...

14:06.694 --> 14:07.694
10 million.

14:07.828 --> 14:09.564
Actually,
it's only 3.

14:09.697 --> 14:12.066
I mean,
this isn't the city.

14:12.199 --> 14:15.235
If we put in an offer
we can close at 2.5.

14:15.370 --> 14:19.841
Yeah, but I am looking
in the $250,000 range.

14:19.973 --> 14:22.175
I get it, but you know,
think of it as an investment.

14:22.309 --> 14:25.380
You only need 10% down,
and then you and your family

14:25.512 --> 14:28.715
can enjoy life
like the other half.

14:28.849 --> 14:30.650
And you can buy your wife
the house

14:30.785 --> 14:32.654
that she always dreamed of.

14:34.722 --> 14:37.324
Actually, my wife passed.

14:37.458 --> 14:39.261
Six months ago.

14:39.394 --> 14:40.862
God, I'm sorry, I...

14:40.995 --> 14:43.397
I just, you know, I saw your
ring, and I just assumed...

14:43.530 --> 14:44.631
Breast cancer.

14:44.766 --> 14:46.467
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:46.601 --> 14:49.537
Nope, it's just me,

14:49.670 --> 14:51.738
and my two very stubborn

14:51.872 --> 14:53.675
and rebellious
teenage daughters.

14:53.808 --> 14:55.510
I'm just looking
to start fresh.

14:55.644 --> 14:59.346
Their mother, she really knew
how to communicate with them.

14:59.479 --> 15:01.581
Every time I open my mouth
it's like I'm verbally trying

15:01.716 --> 15:02.583
to disarm a bomb.

15:02.716 --> 15:04.152
It's funny.

15:04.285 --> 15:06.554
I was the exact same way
when I was a teenager.

15:06.688 --> 15:09.390
Are you married?

15:09.522 --> 15:10.958
Yeah, I was. Um...

15:11.092 --> 15:14.362
but he left me for
a 22-year-old weather boy.

15:17.431 --> 15:20.067
What do you say you show me
the rest of the house?

15:31.378 --> 15:33.046
You gotta be kidding me!

15:37.718 --> 15:40.420
This is amazing!

15:40.554 --> 15:41.989
Austyn?

15:46.327 --> 15:47.996
Austyn?

15:51.431 --> 15:53.100
Austyn?

15:58.039 --> 15:59.708
Austyn?

16:03.343 --> 16:04.212
Austyn?

16:04.344 --> 16:05.979
Oh, sorry.

16:06.113 --> 16:10.083
I'm so sorry,
I left my purse upstairs.

16:10.218 --> 16:11.084
Sorry.
Yeah.

16:11.218 --> 16:13.420
Um...
so, what do you think?

16:22.429 --> 16:24.198
Holy fuck balls!

16:24.330 --> 16:26.400
This place is amazing!

16:35.709 --> 16:39.179
You know, most men, they just
buy fast cars to compensate.

16:39.313 --> 16:41.249
Don't you think
this is a bit much?

16:41.381 --> 16:42.916
Okay, you know what?

16:43.050 --> 16:46.253
You have made it perfectly clear
that you are against this, okay?

16:46.386 --> 16:48.155
Note taken.

16:48.289 --> 16:51.826
But we're here now,
the deal is done.

16:51.958 --> 16:54.160
Okay.
Hey!

16:54.295 --> 16:56.229
Can you just try
to enjoy yourself,

16:56.363 --> 16:57.530
please?!

16:57.665 --> 16:59.833
Come on, I need you here
to be with us.

16:59.968 --> 17:03.136
We are a team now,
the three of us.

17:03.271 --> 17:04.472
A team?

17:04.605 --> 17:05.973
I think
you mean a family!

17:06.107 --> 17:08.340
We're a family now,
the three of us.

17:08.474 --> 17:11.579
Jesus, what is it with men
and sports analogies?

17:22.690 --> 17:24.192
Thank God.

17:35.736 --> 17:38.438
This place
is fucking awesome!

17:38.572 --> 17:40.574
Did you see
the town on the drive in?

17:40.707 --> 17:42.376
It looks like the town
from "Phenomenon."

17:42.510 --> 17:45.213
Hey, John Travolta was
fucking hot in that movie.

17:45.347 --> 17:46.914
I definitely would
have sucked...

17:47.048 --> 17:49.983
Hey, girls!
Hey, Pops.

17:50.117 --> 17:51.786
Did you pick what rooms
you're going to take?

17:51.918 --> 17:54.555
Yeah. I'm all unpacked.
I'm gonna check out the pool.

17:54.688 --> 17:56.925
BTW, having a pool
is fucking amazing!

17:57.058 --> 17:59.460
Well, I'm glad you like it.

17:59.594 --> 18:02.330
Are you all settled in?

18:02.463 --> 18:03.764
I think I left
a box of books.

18:03.897 --> 18:05.232
I bet downtown
has a bookstore.

18:05.366 --> 18:07.167
We could drive in tomorrow
and check it out.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.935
What do you think?
Do you think they have

18:09.069 --> 18:11.438
a first edition
of "Farewell to Arms"?

18:11.572 --> 18:14.107
A what?
Never mind.

18:14.241 --> 18:17.545
Well, we can have
somebody ship it.

18:17.678 --> 18:19.680
Jesus Christ.

18:33.927 --> 18:36.196
Jesus Christ!

18:36.329 --> 18:37.530
Dad, are you okay?

18:37.665 --> 18:40.334
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.637
Fucking bird.

18:47.508 --> 18:51.712
Hey, did you guys know that
the doorbell has a camera on it?

18:51.845 --> 18:52.947
It's called RING!

18:53.080 --> 18:54.615
And, yeah,
we're aware.

18:54.748 --> 18:55.816
It's called RING.

18:55.948 --> 18:57.284
It's pretty cool.

18:58.618 --> 19:00.987
Oh! Welcome!

19:01.121 --> 19:03.156
We thought you'd be
so busy unpacking

19:03.290 --> 19:05.225
that you wouldn't
be able to answer,

19:05.359 --> 19:07.728
but we got lucky,
and here you are.

19:07.861 --> 19:09.162
Well, thank you
so very much.

19:09.296 --> 19:11.499
I'm Joan Gleeson.
And I am David.

19:11.632 --> 19:12.934
Ah, Jim...

19:13.067 --> 19:15.136
Jim Van Patton.
It's a pleasure.

19:15.269 --> 19:17.972
We just wanted to stop by and
welcome you to the neighborhood.

19:18.105 --> 19:20.474
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Come on in.

19:20.607 --> 19:23.409
Oh, no no no, it's quite
alright, we can't stay.

19:23.543 --> 19:27.180
I think my left boob
is smaller than my right boob.

19:27.313 --> 19:29.849
Randy.
come meet the neighbors.

19:29.983 --> 19:31.953
Maybe.

19:32.086 --> 19:34.454
This is Joan
and David Gleeson.

19:34.588 --> 19:35.857
Hi, I'm Randy.

19:35.990 --> 19:38.593
Oh, hi, Randy.
Nice to meet you as well.

19:38.725 --> 19:39.926
Hey,
where's your sister?

19:40.059 --> 19:41.995
Oh, she's probably
upstairs sulking.

19:42.129 --> 19:44.064
Oh, grab her really fast. I want
her to meet the neighbors.

19:44.197 --> 19:45.365
Sure.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.868
Staci, come downstairs
and meet the neighbors!

19:49.002 --> 19:50.871
Kids.

19:51.004 --> 19:54.975
Hiya gorgeous, this is Joan
and David Gleeson.

19:55.108 --> 19:56.810
This is my youngest, Staci.

19:56.944 --> 19:59.512
Hi, Staci, it's very nice
to meet you.

19:59.646 --> 20:01.014
Yeah, you too.

20:01.148 --> 20:02.382
Dad, I'm gonna
go hit the pool.

20:02.515 --> 20:04.751
Have fun. Thanks.
Nice to meet you.

20:04.885 --> 20:07.188
You as well!

20:07.321 --> 20:10.290
So great seeing this house
filled with a family again.

20:10.424 --> 20:14.261
Yeah, they told it was on the
market for what, over a year?

20:14.395 --> 20:15.328
Longer, I think.

20:15.463 --> 20:17.064
Yeah,
it's nice it finally sold.

20:17.196 --> 20:19.533
It was really putting a pitch
on the property value.

20:19.666 --> 20:22.270
Don't want to be upside down
on a mortgage, tell you what.

20:22.403 --> 20:25.271
Right.
Well, I'm glad we found it.

20:25.405 --> 20:27.407
Just make sure you keep up
on the yard.

20:27.540 --> 20:30.444
Nobody likes getting
a letter from the HOA...

20:30.578 --> 20:32.112
Home Owners Association.

20:32.245 --> 20:34.415
I'll give you Luis's number.
He does our yard, he's fabulous.

20:34.549 --> 20:37.518
That would be fantastic,
thank you so much.

20:37.652 --> 20:40.154
Ah, so, you know,
when you're all settled,

20:40.287 --> 20:42.423
we'd love to have you
over for dinner...

20:42.557 --> 20:44.458
and your wife.

20:44.590 --> 20:45.926
Oh, it's...

20:46.059 --> 20:48.028
it's just me and the girls.
Oh...

20:48.162 --> 20:50.231
Well, again it's great
having you here,

20:50.365 --> 20:52.666
and we hope you'll love it
as much as we do.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.703
Maybe you and I can hit
the links together sometime?

20:55.837 --> 20:57.105
- Sure thing.
- Alright.

20:57.238 --> 20:58.506
Well, we'll let you get back
to settling in.

20:58.638 --> 21:00.707
And if you need
anything at all, we are

21:00.841 --> 21:02.876
just the house
to the right.

21:03.010 --> 21:03.977
Great.
Sure.

21:04.110 --> 21:05.379
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

21:25.966 --> 21:29.969
You know, you could go
a little easier on him.

21:30.104 --> 21:31.838
You two have
a closer relationship.

21:31.972 --> 21:33.206
Whatever, dude.

21:33.340 --> 21:36.709
You know he cares about you
just as much.

21:36.844 --> 21:38.112
He doesn't have a choice.

21:38.244 --> 21:40.246
You know how hard
this has been for him?

21:40.379 --> 21:43.583
You know
how much he loved her.

21:43.717 --> 21:46.152
I just...
I feel so lost without her.

21:46.287 --> 21:49.190
We all feel lost
without her.

21:49.322 --> 21:50.724
That's why it's so important
that we are there

21:50.858 --> 21:54.361
for each other now,
more than ever.

21:55.863 --> 21:58.532
I feel like I would be
better off on my own, honestly.

21:58.665 --> 22:00.835
How can you say that?

22:00.969 --> 22:04.004
I couldn't even imagine
you not being around.

22:04.137 --> 22:06.339
I mean you can
put on this facade

22:06.473 --> 22:08.909
and play the lone
she-wolf routine,

22:09.042 --> 22:13.379
but I know, as well as you do,
you'd miss me.

22:13.513 --> 22:15.815
Maybe.
Maybe?!

22:15.948 --> 22:17.250
Bitch!

22:17.384 --> 22:19.286
Stop it! Stop!
Are you fucking kidding me?!

22:19.419 --> 22:20.654
Make me!

22:22.155 --> 22:24.558
Shit.

22:58.626 --> 23:00.126
<i>It'll be alright
about Helen.</i>

23:00.261 --> 23:02.061
<i>I'll send her
to Switzerland.</i>

25:09.056 --> 25:10.391
Randy, are you alright?

25:10.523 --> 25:12.559
There's somebody outside!

26:16.522 --> 26:20.861
Dispatch, I need a team
at 616 Wilford Lane!

26:21.896 --> 26:24.530
Jesus Christ.

26:24.665 --> 26:26.434
You got some pipes on you,
honey.

26:26.567 --> 26:29.370
You scared this bottle
right off the counter.

26:34.642 --> 26:37.578
Evening.
Sheriff James, Deputy Boyle.

26:37.711 --> 26:40.614
Thank you so much
for coming so quickly.

26:40.746 --> 26:44.851
Ah, Jim...
Jim Van Patton.

26:44.984 --> 26:46.353
Please come on inside.

26:46.486 --> 26:47.754
It's, uh,
fine out here.

26:49.823 --> 26:55.028
We... were notified about
a possible home intrusion?

26:55.396 --> 26:57.664
Uh, no.
Actually my...

26:57.798 --> 27:01.134
my daughter thinks she saw
someone peeping in on her

27:01.268 --> 27:03.103
while she was changing.

27:03.236 --> 27:05.038
Did you get a clear look
at the suspect?

27:05.172 --> 27:09.476
Did I? No, my daughter saw him
through the window.

27:09.609 --> 27:13.112
Can we speak with your daughter
then, uh, with your permission?

27:13.245 --> 27:14.447
Of course you can.

27:14.580 --> 27:18.350
Hey, Randy,
come here please.

27:18.484 --> 27:20.288
It's okay honey, come on.

27:23.089 --> 27:24.992
Hi.
Hello, ma'am.

27:25.125 --> 27:27.426
Your father was telling us
that you, uh...

27:27.560 --> 27:30.830
caught someone
peeping in on you.

27:30.964 --> 27:32.066
Yes.

27:32.198 --> 27:35.134
I mean, maybe...

27:35.268 --> 27:38.005
It was just a shadow.

27:38.137 --> 27:39.639
It was really dark.

27:39.772 --> 27:42.909
Are you certain that
someone was watching you?

27:43.042 --> 27:45.145
Something was there...

27:45.279 --> 27:46.680
I think.

27:46.812 --> 27:48.781
Well, I chased after him.
You chased after him?

27:48.915 --> 27:51.385
Well, I ran outside,

27:51.519 --> 27:54.387
and by the time
I got there he was gone.

27:54.521 --> 27:57.924
I think he ran over
to David's yard.

27:58.058 --> 27:59.225
David's yard?

27:59.358 --> 28:00.461
Yeah, um...

28:00.594 --> 28:02.963
Joan and David, um...
Gleeson.

28:03.097 --> 28:04.598
We met them earlier today.

28:04.732 --> 28:07.867
You met the Mayor and his wife
earlier today?

28:08.001 --> 28:09.269
David is the Mayor?

28:09.402 --> 28:10.636
10 years strong.

28:10.771 --> 28:15.209
He, uh...
failed to mention that part.

28:15.341 --> 28:18.111
Mayor Gleeson,
humble...

28:18.244 --> 28:20.981
to a fault.

28:21.114 --> 28:24.985
Okay, well, regardless,
where do we go from here?

28:25.117 --> 28:29.490
Well, we can, uh, go over
and talk to Mayor Gleeson

28:29.623 --> 28:31.558
and see
if they noticed anything.

28:31.692 --> 28:33.460
The chances are it's a...

28:33.592 --> 28:36.730
(KAI-OAT)
just a coyote.

28:36.864 --> 28:37.932
"Kai-oat"?

28:38.065 --> 28:40.033
(KAI-YO-TEE)
Coyote.

28:40.166 --> 28:42.269
Oh.

28:42.403 --> 28:44.471
Woods are filled
with them here, hills...

28:44.605 --> 28:48.809
and at night,
and they scavenge for...

28:48.943 --> 28:51.877
house pets, cats.

28:52.011 --> 28:54.380
Now both you and your daughter
stated that neither

28:54.514 --> 28:56.516
of you got a clear
look at the perpetrator.

28:56.649 --> 28:59.419
So, well, unless you have
something else

28:59.552 --> 29:02.088
that you can remember,
it's...

29:02.222 --> 29:06.559
Yeah, I suggest
that, uh, you get a rifle.

29:06.693 --> 29:09.462
It's for
your own protection.

29:09.596 --> 29:11.498
Well, I... I own a rifle,

29:11.630 --> 29:14.267
but I have
no intention of using it.

29:14.402 --> 29:15.736
You don't have to hit 'em.
You just...

29:15.868 --> 29:20.307
a shot
is gonna chase them off.

29:20.440 --> 29:22.443
Here.

29:22.576 --> 29:24.778
What's this?
Flash drive.

29:24.912 --> 29:27.914
I downloaded all of tonight's
security camera footage onto it.

29:28.048 --> 29:29.349
Maybe you can
sift through it and see

29:29.482 --> 29:32.652
if you can get
a clear shot of him.

29:32.786 --> 29:37.524
Well, thank you,
and y'all have a goodnight,

29:37.656 --> 29:42.162
and lock up,
and keep the rifle handy...

29:42.296 --> 29:43.798
somewhere
where you can find it.

29:43.931 --> 29:45.499
Goodnight.

29:45.633 --> 29:47.101
Well, excuse me, aren't you...
aren't you gonna go

29:47.233 --> 29:48.769
over to the Gleesons?

29:51.805 --> 29:53.907
Listen, it's not a good idea
for me to go over

29:54.040 --> 29:57.109
and wake the Mayor
at this time of night.

29:57.243 --> 29:59.579
Now, if you have any other
problems, please give me a call,

29:59.713 --> 30:01.848
I'll gladly come back.

30:01.982 --> 30:02.849
Ladies.

30:09.223 --> 30:12.259
Come on, let's get you inside,
let's get some rest.

30:22.435 --> 30:25.204
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

30:25.338 --> 30:29.343
"Netflix and chill" doesn't mean
watch a movie and relax?

30:29.475 --> 30:31.544
No.
It's code.

30:31.677 --> 30:32.912
Code?
Code for what?

30:33.046 --> 30:34.581
For what we girls do
with guys

30:34.714 --> 30:36.582
that we generally
don't like to define

30:36.715 --> 30:38.484
for our parental figures.
Okay, that's gross,

30:38.617 --> 30:39.720
why are we still
talking about this?

30:39.853 --> 30:41.488
Because it is making
uncomfortable.

30:41.620 --> 30:43.857
Yes!
There's a coffee shop.

30:43.991 --> 30:46.026
I mean, it's not Starbucks,
but it will do.

30:46.159 --> 30:47.960
Okay, do you really
need coffee?

30:48.095 --> 30:50.530
Yeah. Okay, because when I
was your age I didn't drink...

30:50.664 --> 30:52.366
Yeah, we know, okay,
you walked both ways

30:52.499 --> 30:54.300
uphill in the snow
and you had to rent movies

30:54.434 --> 30:55.769
and rewind them
and suffer late fees.

30:55.903 --> 30:57.504
I totally had to rewind them.

30:57.637 --> 31:00.106
Yeah.
Yeah, because it was tape.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.008
Bye!

31:02.142 --> 31:05.846
Alright, well, are you
just gonna... Alright. Have fun.

31:15.888 --> 31:18.258
Hey, Jim,
Jim, Jim, Jim.

31:18.392 --> 31:19.793
Hey, hey, David.
Good morning.

31:19.926 --> 31:22.127
Or should I say Mayor Gleeson?

31:22.261 --> 31:24.129
I guess the secret's out.

31:24.263 --> 31:27.132
So, I heard there was
some commotion at the house?

31:27.267 --> 31:29.936
Is everything alright?
Yeah, no, everything is fine, thank you.

31:30.069 --> 31:31.605
Yeah, Randy was
a little shaken up.

31:31.738 --> 31:34.741
Yeah.
Let me put your mind at ease.

31:34.875 --> 31:37.944
This is one of
the safest cities in the state.

31:38.078 --> 31:41.647
I mean chances are it was just
some critter looking for scraps.

31:41.781 --> 31:44.050
But it's better being safe
than sorry, right?

31:44.184 --> 31:46.152
And you don't need to go
calling the Sheriff,

31:46.286 --> 31:48.088
upsetting the neighbors.

31:48.221 --> 31:51.691
Well, yeah, you know, I'm sure
Randy was overreacting a bit.

31:51.825 --> 31:53.326
Exactly.
You know teenagers,

31:53.460 --> 31:55.862
always blowing things
out of proportion, exaggerating.

31:55.995 --> 31:58.898
You have to think
about the property values.

31:59.031 --> 32:01.768
I mean, why would somebody
pay for a gated community

32:01.902 --> 32:04.838
if the gates don't work,
am I right?

32:04.972 --> 32:07.007
Yeah, sure.
But, uh...

32:07.139 --> 32:08.974
Oh, hey, do you have any plans
for this evening?

32:09.108 --> 32:10.944
Well, I was gonna Netflix and chill.
Good, because Joan and I

32:11.077 --> 32:12.444
were going to grab
some dinner and drinks

32:12.578 --> 32:13.547
at the Alehouse
with some friends.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.148
Why won't you join us?

32:15.281 --> 32:17.184
Oh, I don't know about that.
Ah, come on, buddy,

32:17.318 --> 32:19.185
Joan and I
rarely get out.

32:19.319 --> 32:21.320
Come on.

32:21.454 --> 32:22.422
Sounds like a good time.

32:22.556 --> 32:24.824
8:00 it is.
8:00.

32:24.957 --> 32:26.492
I'll see you there.
Okay.

32:37.771 --> 32:40.174
Hang on. Those are
the new girls, right?

32:40.307 --> 32:42.376
Yeah, yeah,
Randy and... something.

32:42.509 --> 32:44.544
Goddamn,
she's fucking hot.

32:44.677 --> 32:45.544
What...

32:54.587 --> 32:56.056
What's up?
I'm Matt.

32:56.188 --> 32:57.656
I know who you are.

32:57.790 --> 32:59.092
Hotshot quarterback,
right?

32:59.225 --> 33:00.827
Number 1 in the state!

33:00.961 --> 33:03.730
What is it with small towns and
their predilection for football?

33:03.863 --> 33:05.866
Don't your type normally date
the head cheerleader

33:05.999 --> 33:07.867
or something?

33:08.001 --> 33:11.338
I, uh, I just wanted to say hi
and introduce myself.

33:11.472 --> 33:15.040
It's, uh, Randy, right?

33:15.175 --> 33:16.309
That's right.

33:16.443 --> 33:17.711
And this is my sister,
Staci.

33:17.844 --> 33:19.612
It's nice to meet you, Staci.
I'm Matt.

33:19.745 --> 33:22.014
Yeah, what's good,
I'm Miles.

33:22.147 --> 33:24.350
Alright, well,
you ladies have a lovely day

33:24.484 --> 33:25.651
and enjoy your weekend.

33:25.786 --> 33:27.654
I just wanted to say
welcome to Auburn.

33:27.787 --> 33:31.558
Can I, uh,
can I get your Snap?

33:31.691 --> 33:32.626
Sure.

33:32.759 --> 33:34.461
It's Randy-I-am.

33:34.595 --> 33:36.764
Alright. Awesome.

33:36.896 --> 33:39.499
See you.
It's nice meeting y'all.

34:10.929 --> 34:13.600
Jesus, don't you think
it's a little tight?

34:13.734 --> 34:16.303
Please!
You wish you looked this good.

34:18.938 --> 34:20.106
Aw, Dad, you look awesome.

34:20.239 --> 34:22.609
Oh, thank you.

34:24.143 --> 34:25.543
I remember her doing this
for you.

34:25.678 --> 34:27.147
Yeah, because I could
never do it.

34:27.281 --> 34:28.949
Where are you going
tonight?

34:29.081 --> 34:30.850
Well, if you must know,
I'm having drinks with the Mayor

34:30.984 --> 34:32.717
and his wife,
and some friends.

34:32.851 --> 34:33.987
Ooh, the Mayor!

34:34.120 --> 34:35.955
Way to infiltrate
that aristocracy.

34:36.089 --> 34:37.458
You look great!

34:37.591 --> 34:38.658
Thank you.

34:38.790 --> 34:41.860
Good job, sweetie.

34:41.995 --> 34:43.130
What the hell
are you wearing?

34:43.263 --> 34:44.097
I look hot, right?

34:44.228 --> 34:46.632
No, you look
like a hooker.

34:46.764 --> 34:49.001
This is
Alexandre Vauthier.

34:49.135 --> 34:50.771
I have no idea
who that is.

34:50.902 --> 34:52.204
That's okay.

34:52.338 --> 34:54.040
All that matters is that
you bought it for me!

34:54.172 --> 34:55.641
Oh, if you're happy,
then I'm happy.

34:55.775 --> 34:56.876
Now go upstairs
and get a coat.

34:57.010 --> 34:58.877
Are you kidding me?

34:59.011 --> 35:01.013
Honey,
you are in high school,

35:01.147 --> 35:03.350
in a very small town with people
who inevitably gossip.

35:03.482 --> 35:05.151
I'm not going to be that father
who allows his daughter

35:05.285 --> 35:06.854
to go out
dressed like that.

35:06.986 --> 35:08.321
But I don't have a coat
that matches this dress...

35:08.455 --> 35:09.289
Upstairs!
Coat, now!

35:09.421 --> 35:12.358
No argument!

35:12.493 --> 35:13.794
Really?!

35:13.926 --> 35:16.363
Oh, shit, I gotta go.

35:17.564 --> 35:20.701
You look good.

35:20.834 --> 35:22.167
Thank you.

35:22.301 --> 35:24.905
Look, if you need anything
I'm a call away, okay?

35:25.037 --> 35:27.707
Okay. If anything goes wrong,
I'll just grab the rifle.

35:27.841 --> 35:29.543
Don't say that.
I know.

35:29.676 --> 35:31.310
I know, I'm kidding.
Don't touch the gun.

35:31.443 --> 35:33.345
Look, you girls are old enough
where I don't have to worry

35:33.479 --> 35:35.048
about having a gun
in the house, okay?

35:35.182 --> 35:36.616
But when I get some time,

35:36.749 --> 35:37.917
I am gonna show you
how to use it.

35:38.051 --> 35:39.252
Really?
Yeah.

35:39.385 --> 35:41.321
Sweet!

35:41.453 --> 35:42.990
Love you.

36:17.823 --> 36:20.426
Hey, there he is!

36:20.560 --> 36:21.593
Welcome!

36:21.727 --> 36:24.097
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

36:24.231 --> 36:25.832
Oh, hello.
Hello.

36:25.964 --> 36:26.899
Long time no see.

36:27.033 --> 36:29.002
Yeah.
How are you?

36:29.135 --> 36:30.702
I'm well.
Nice to see you.

36:30.836 --> 36:31.972
Uh, it's a little crazy.

36:32.106 --> 36:33.305
- Yeah?
- But it's nice to see you.

36:33.439 --> 36:34.441
You too.

37:26.859 --> 37:28.495
Dad?

37:31.397 --> 37:32.299
Randy?

37:45.477 --> 37:46.812
Dad?

38:44.703 --> 38:46.472
D'oh!
Jesus Christ, what the fuck?!

38:46.606 --> 38:48.107
There's somebody inside the house!
What?!

38:48.240 --> 38:49.708
Inside my room.
What?

39:00.120 --> 39:01.755
Stay here!

39:22.776 --> 39:24.743
All clear.

39:24.877 --> 39:27.680
What?! No!
That's not possible!

39:36.055 --> 39:39.091
Yeah, I don't know what to tell
you, the entire house is empty.

39:39.225 --> 39:41.761
The chandelier moved
on it's own,

39:41.894 --> 39:42.861
and my door slammed shut.

39:42.995 --> 39:44.798
I swear.
I believe you.

39:44.930 --> 39:46.398
It was probably
just the wind.

39:46.533 --> 39:48.267
Look, the window was open
in the room,

39:48.401 --> 39:50.169
and it must have caused the door
to slam during a burst of wind,

39:50.303 --> 39:51.837
or something...

39:51.970 --> 39:56.208
Hey, hey, we're here now,
and the house is empty, okay?

39:56.341 --> 39:58.912
I heard banging on
the other side of the door.

39:59.046 --> 40:02.181
I mean, I don't know
what we can do...

40:02.314 --> 40:04.316
Dad's not answering and, um...

40:04.450 --> 40:06.653
I guess we could call
the Sheriff?

40:06.785 --> 40:08.054
What?

40:08.187 --> 40:09.988
Call the Sheriff's office
and tell him what?

40:10.122 --> 40:11.557
A door closed
in the house?

40:11.691 --> 40:14.060
That the chandelier
is possessed?

40:18.397 --> 40:20.733
Ah!
The security cameras!

40:44.656 --> 40:47.227
Look, it's right here.

40:48.761 --> 40:50.263
See!
It's the wind.

40:50.397 --> 40:53.766
Look, look, no one is
in the room and the door closes.

40:53.899 --> 40:56.368
I don't know, Staci, it could be
a draft, or something.

40:56.502 --> 40:57.738
What if
it's something else?

40:57.870 --> 41:00.372
Like what?

41:00.506 --> 41:01.807
Maybe it's
something paranormal.

41:01.941 --> 41:04.044
A ghost?

41:04.176 --> 41:05.544
Dude, are you
fucking kidding me?

41:05.678 --> 41:07.113
If a ghost was actually
haunting your house...

41:07.245 --> 41:09.448
Aah!

41:09.582 --> 41:11.484
You should have seen your face!
This isn't a fucking joke.

41:11.618 --> 41:14.254
Oh, wait, come back!
I was just messing with you.

41:18.258 --> 41:20.060
Oh, fuck.

41:21.026 --> 41:21.994
Randy?!

41:22.127 --> 41:24.363
- Staci?!
- In here.

41:28.267 --> 41:29.135
What happened?

41:29.267 --> 41:30.635
It's still up for debate.

41:30.769 --> 41:32.304
Look at this.

41:34.841 --> 41:36.142
What am I looking at?

41:36.274 --> 41:38.110
This is the security cam footage
from tonight.

41:38.243 --> 41:40.111
Okay.

41:40.245 --> 41:42.814
It's probably
just a draft.

41:42.948 --> 41:46.019
That's what Matt said.

41:46.151 --> 41:48.554
She's really freaked out.

41:48.687 --> 41:50.856
Where is she?
Upstairs asleep.

42:13.113 --> 42:14.580
I'm gonna go check on her,
okay?

42:14.714 --> 42:16.249
- How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

42:16.381 --> 42:17.783
Alright, we'll talk about it
in the morning.

42:17.917 --> 42:19.084
Yeah.
Goodnight.

42:30.530 --> 42:33.332
<i>Jesus. Staci,
what are you doing up?</i>

42:35.301 --> 42:38.171
<i>Staci?</i>

42:38.305 --> 42:39.672
<i>Staci, are you okay?</i>

42:42.207 --> 42:43.274
<i>Staci?!</i>

42:59.792 --> 43:02.728
So you don't
remember anything?

43:02.861 --> 43:04.597
No.

43:04.729 --> 43:08.233
So it had to be
sleepwalking.

43:08.367 --> 43:09.836
So what happened next?

43:09.968 --> 43:12.905
You slightly woke up
and I helped you back into bed

43:13.039 --> 43:16.008
- What about the door?
- Do you guys know where my beach tote is?

43:16.142 --> 43:19.111
What's a beach tote?
It's a bag you put all your beach shit in,

43:19.245 --> 43:21.982
like lotion, and towels...

43:22.115 --> 43:25.216
Hallway cabinet,
living room.

43:25.350 --> 43:26.486
I already saw it...

43:26.618 --> 43:28.787
with your sister.
Okay.

43:28.921 --> 43:33.725
I'm with Matt on this one,
it looks a draft.

43:33.859 --> 43:35.394
To me it was scary.

43:35.528 --> 43:37.663
Okay, but
from what I'm seeing

43:37.796 --> 43:39.865
it's a little farfetched
to say the house is haunted.

43:39.999 --> 43:41.134
What are you saying?

43:41.267 --> 43:42.468
It's not a haunting
until what?

43:42.602 --> 43:45.504
Until something drags me to hell?
Yes.

43:45.638 --> 43:47.707
So I'll just wait around until
something potentially kills me?!

43:47.839 --> 43:51.310
Look, I know that
moving is hard,

43:51.443 --> 43:55.714
and maybe...

43:55.847 --> 43:59.017
and maybe the loss of...
Don't you dare!

43:59.151 --> 44:01.753
Okay, I understand.

44:01.888 --> 44:05.024
Packing up is difficult.

44:05.156 --> 44:06.459
Okay?

44:06.591 --> 44:10.729
But we're here now,
in this amazing house.

44:10.863 --> 44:14.233
And, yes,
starting over is hard.

44:14.367 --> 44:15.968
This has nothing to do
with the move!

44:16.102 --> 44:18.304
It feels like you two
are teaming up on me!

44:18.437 --> 44:19.671
No, we're not!

44:19.805 --> 44:22.173
Okay, let's... let's...
let's just look at it

44:22.307 --> 44:23.976
from a different perspective,
okay?

44:24.109 --> 44:25.678
An outsiders'
perspective.

44:25.810 --> 44:27.412
- Haunted house...
- Mm-hmm.

44:27.546 --> 44:29.647
Teenage girl all by herself
in the middle of the night,

44:29.781 --> 44:33.017
blowing things out
of proportion...

44:33.151 --> 44:34.854
Huh?

44:34.986 --> 44:38.191
We just all handle
grief differently.

44:38.323 --> 44:39.526
It's all I'm saying.

44:39.658 --> 44:42.227
I probably drink too much.
You sleepwalk.

44:42.361 --> 44:43.930
Your sister...

44:44.062 --> 44:45.964
wears less clothes.

44:46.097 --> 44:47.766
It's all perfectly normal.

44:47.901 --> 44:48.667
You're right!

44:48.801 --> 44:50.403
You're so right!

44:50.535 --> 44:52.338
I mean, it's probably
just the wind.

44:52.472 --> 44:53.939
I just have an overly
active imagination.

44:54.073 --> 44:55.975
Come on, that's not what I'm saying...
No, you know what?

44:56.109 --> 44:58.344
I can't do this
right now.

44:58.477 --> 45:00.013
Where are you going?
Matt's house.

45:00.146 --> 45:02.046
Chill in the backyard,
catch some rings.

45:02.180 --> 45:03.381
Sweet.
Can I come?

45:03.515 --> 45:05.117
Fuck yeah, you can!

45:05.251 --> 45:08.319
Awesome!
I'm gonna go change.

45:08.453 --> 45:11.890
Who's ganging up
on who now?!

45:12.024 --> 45:13.325
Chicks before dicks!

45:13.459 --> 45:15.028
What does that even mean?

45:21.934 --> 45:23.803
Fuck!

45:33.747 --> 45:37.283
So, I think my dad's
fucking someone.

45:37.417 --> 45:38.584
No shit!

45:38.718 --> 45:41.421
Women can just sense
these things.

45:41.553 --> 45:45.557
You... You really think Dad's
seeing someone?

45:45.691 --> 45:47.859
I mean,
it's nobody special.

45:47.993 --> 45:49.662
If it was his girlfriend
we would have met her.

45:49.794 --> 45:52.164
But he is definitely hooking up.
Gross, dude!

45:52.298 --> 45:53.399
Don't say this shit!

45:53.531 --> 45:56.135
Relax!
Everybody's gotta get laid.

45:56.267 --> 45:58.103
Dad, you...

45:58.236 --> 45:59.537
definitely you...

45:59.671 --> 46:01.439
me...
everyone!

46:02.607 --> 46:04.510
Cheers to that!

46:07.847 --> 46:12.218
So, I hear your house
is haunted?

46:12.350 --> 46:14.185
Oh, yeah?
Where did you hear that?

46:14.319 --> 46:17.189
Word gets around.

46:17.323 --> 46:18.790
It could be.

46:18.925 --> 46:21.260
You think so?

46:21.392 --> 46:25.798
I mean, a couple of years back
there this older kid named Cody.

46:25.930 --> 46:28.033
He...

46:28.167 --> 46:30.236
Dude, what the fuck?!

46:30.370 --> 46:31.905
Dude...

46:32.037 --> 46:33.039
chill with that.

46:33.173 --> 46:34.107
Why?
I was just saying...

46:34.240 --> 46:37.910
Saying what?

46:38.044 --> 46:39.646
Nothing.

46:39.778 --> 46:43.281
Come on, tell me.
I want to know.

46:43.415 --> 46:45.118
It's nothing.
It's nothing.

46:45.251 --> 46:46.484
Last year, this kid,

46:46.618 --> 46:48.220
he did some stupid shit
in your neighborhood.

46:48.354 --> 46:51.122
That's all.

46:51.256 --> 46:52.423
Okay...

46:52.557 --> 46:54.359
don't tell me.

46:54.493 --> 46:57.363
It's probably not
that good anyways.

46:57.497 --> 46:59.298
No, it's bad.

46:59.432 --> 47:02.334
Like, my mom still cries
when she thinks about it bad.

47:02.468 --> 47:03.336
So...
Really?

47:03.468 --> 47:04.903
It doesn't matter.

47:05.037 --> 47:07.673
It has nothing to do with
some door closing at your house.

47:07.807 --> 47:11.209
I mean, besides, do you
really want to be the new girl

47:11.343 --> 47:13.479
who thinks
her house is haunted?

47:13.611 --> 47:16.115
Fuck that!
We just moved here.

47:16.249 --> 47:18.417
I'm not gonna be
the weird girl.

47:21.519 --> 47:22.387
How was it?

47:22.521 --> 47:23.689
Fucking awesome!

47:23.823 --> 47:25.925
I'm gonna go take a shower.
Cool.

47:26.057 --> 47:28.326
Hey, it was great hanging out
with you tonight.

47:28.461 --> 47:30.129
Yeah, I had a good time.

47:40.506 --> 47:42.008
Did you have fun?
Yeah.

47:42.140 --> 47:44.242
It was cool.

47:44.376 --> 47:47.280
Do you have any plans
tonight?

47:47.412 --> 47:49.748
Not that I know of.
Why?

47:49.883 --> 47:52.118
Are you trying to get me
out of the house?

47:52.251 --> 47:55.053
No, it's just...

47:55.187 --> 47:56.555
uh...

47:56.689 --> 47:59.893
you were out really late
last night, and...

48:02.461 --> 48:04.863
Never mind.

48:06.432 --> 48:09.468
Do you wanna pop some popcorn
and play some pool?

48:09.602 --> 48:11.636
Yeah.
Let's go.

48:52.678 --> 48:56.214
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Dad.

48:56.348 --> 48:59.151
Are you okay?
Yeah.

49:06.359 --> 49:09.127
Hey, how are you doing?

49:09.260 --> 49:10.328
I'm good.

49:10.463 --> 49:12.531
Yeah?
Yeah.

49:12.664 --> 49:13.565
Okay.
Goodnight.

49:13.698 --> 49:15.367
Goodnight.

49:15.501 --> 49:17.537
How is she doing?

49:17.669 --> 49:19.537
We're gonna be okay.

49:19.671 --> 49:21.939
We just needed to settle
into this place,

49:22.073 --> 49:24.976
but, uh, I think
it's working out.

49:25.109 --> 49:26.511
Okay.

49:26.646 --> 49:28.515
Sweet dreams.

51:47.885 --> 51:49.387
<i>What's the matter?</i>

51:51.823 --> 51:52.758
<i>Staci!</i>

51:52.892 --> 51:54.359
<i>What?</i>

51:55.961 --> 51:57.430
<i>Staci?!</i>

52:04.468 --> 52:05.370
<i>Staci?!</i>

52:05.504 --> 52:06.672
<i>Staci?!</i>

52:06.805 --> 52:08.908
<i>Staci?!</i>

52:11.810 --> 52:13.446
<i>Dad, I found her!</i>

52:14.713 --> 52:16.247
<i>Staci?</i>

52:36.868 --> 52:39.537
It's peculiar
to say the least.

52:45.910 --> 52:49.781
What is it I can do
for you, Mr. Van Patton?

52:49.914 --> 52:53.017
Um...

52:53.151 --> 52:57.488
I just need somebody to, uh,
look at the footage and...

52:57.622 --> 52:59.024
and give me their assessment.

52:59.158 --> 53:02.560
I think you daughter Staci
is a sleepwalker.

53:02.694 --> 53:06.399
Randy's blanket, that adheres
to the laws of gravity

53:06.531 --> 53:08.633
like anything else.

53:08.767 --> 53:12.504
Have you tried
taking Staci to a...

53:12.638 --> 53:13.538
physician?

53:13.671 --> 53:16.774
I did that this morning.

53:16.908 --> 53:18.977
They said it was...

53:20.278 --> 53:24.782
They said it may be
sleepwalking brought on

53:24.917 --> 53:27.752
by the loss of her mother.

53:27.886 --> 53:29.155
Well,
there's your answer.

53:29.287 --> 53:30.755
I have to say
I agree with it.

53:30.890 --> 53:33.392
Sheriff, um...

53:33.524 --> 53:36.294
with all due respect,

53:36.428 --> 53:39.898
I think there's something
more than that.

53:40.031 --> 53:44.437
Strange things are happening
in my house!

53:44.569 --> 53:46.104
Are you...

53:46.238 --> 53:50.542
suggesting that
something...

53:50.676 --> 53:52.444
ethereal or...?

53:52.577 --> 53:56.082
Have you ever heard of a kid
by the name of Cody?

53:56.214 --> 53:57.582
Cody?

53:57.716 --> 53:59.718
My daughter said
that her, uh,

53:59.852 --> 54:03.222
her boyfriend
and his friend

54:03.356 --> 54:07.526
mentioned a kid that lived in
this town by the name of Cody.

54:07.660 --> 54:11.029
And what are they saying
about this kid Cody?

54:11.162 --> 54:14.399
She really couldn't say.

54:14.533 --> 54:19.305
But she said something
really bad happened.

54:21.274 --> 54:22.908
Mr. Van Patton,
I have been the Sheriff

54:23.040 --> 54:25.644
in this town
for over 25 years.

54:25.778 --> 54:30.183
Most of my days are spent
with property line disputes,

54:32.050 --> 54:35.988
drunken teenagers
causing a ruckus.

54:36.120 --> 54:37.955
If something bigger
than that happens in this town,

54:38.089 --> 54:40.392
I am the one to know.

54:40.526 --> 54:44.830
Something strange
is happening in my house!

54:44.964 --> 54:48.167
Mr. Van Patton,
I am not disputing that.

54:48.301 --> 54:51.136
But right now,
right at this moment,

54:51.269 --> 54:53.171
what would you have me do?

54:57.341 --> 55:01.280
There's nothing... nothing
online anywhere about ghost

55:01.412 --> 55:04.282
or hauntings in Auburn,
California, or Francisco Oaks.

55:04.415 --> 55:07.086
That is because ghosts,
they are not real.

55:07.218 --> 55:08.519
Then how do you explain
the other night?

55:08.653 --> 55:09.820
I don't know.

55:09.955 --> 55:11.390
You said at the doctor
this morning

55:11.524 --> 55:12.758
they said it was stress
leading to your sleepwalking.

55:12.890 --> 55:13.992
They said it could be.

55:14.126 --> 55:15.426
I mean,
they couldn't confirm it.

55:15.560 --> 55:18.097
Oh, come on!
I mean what else could it be?

55:18.231 --> 55:19.899
You get up at the middle
of the night

55:20.031 --> 55:22.633
and you walk around
while you're sleeping.

55:22.767 --> 55:25.838
Well, what about Cody?

55:25.970 --> 55:27.239
What?

55:27.372 --> 55:29.040
Miles, he was saying
something about Cody...

55:29.173 --> 55:31.342
No. No way, I'm not
talking about that.

55:31.477 --> 55:33.979
About what?
Look, that has nothing to do with ghosts.

55:34.111 --> 55:35.314
I mean, it's just
some town tragedy

55:35.446 --> 55:37.915
that we're all trying
to move past.

55:38.048 --> 55:39.316
I mean it...
it could have been...

55:39.450 --> 55:41.353
No it fucking
couldn't have been.

55:45.756 --> 55:47.559
Come on, please?

55:47.693 --> 55:51.030
I'll give you a tour
of my room later.

55:51.162 --> 55:52.865
Okay.
Alright, alright.

55:52.997 --> 55:54.532
Spill.

55:54.667 --> 55:56.268
A couple of years ago...

55:56.401 --> 55:58.203
this kid Cody
shot his mother

55:58.336 --> 56:01.072
and his father
and his little sister.

56:01.205 --> 56:02.341
Oh, my God.

56:02.475 --> 56:04.043
Yeah, so that's
the town's dirty secret.

56:04.176 --> 56:05.578
I mean, we keep it quiet partly
because folks say

56:05.711 --> 56:08.479
it hurts property value
and tourist traffic,

56:08.613 --> 56:10.147
and partly because
the town folks, I mean,

56:10.281 --> 56:12.417
they love their guns,
and nothing makes you rethink

56:12.551 --> 56:14.687
that more than kids
shooting their parents.

56:14.819 --> 56:16.187
What happened to Cody?

56:16.321 --> 56:19.024
After he shot his family
he turned the gun on himself.

56:19.156 --> 56:21.059
Where did this happen?

56:21.193 --> 56:23.160
Francisco Oaks.

56:23.294 --> 56:25.763
Uh, I'm sorry, I don't think
I heard you correctly.

56:25.897 --> 56:28.400
Where?

56:28.533 --> 56:29.735
Francisco Oaks.

56:29.868 --> 56:30.936
Girls,
none of that matters.

56:31.069 --> 56:32.303
How can you be certain?

56:32.437 --> 56:34.807
How many ghosts do you know
that use guns?

56:34.939 --> 56:37.542
Yeah, thank you.

56:51.089 --> 56:52.457
How are you
so bad at this?

56:52.591 --> 56:54.059
Shut up!
I've never done this before.

56:54.193 --> 56:56.395
I don't understand.

56:56.528 --> 56:57.428
Uh...

56:57.562 --> 56:59.464
let me show you
how to do it.

56:59.597 --> 57:02.400
Actually, you know what?
Here, let me show you.

57:02.535 --> 57:03.969
Let me help you out
real quick.

57:04.102 --> 57:05.671
Seriously?
What?

57:05.805 --> 57:07.372
The old "teach you
how to play pool" move.

57:07.506 --> 57:09.241
Hey,
you need to focus.

57:09.374 --> 57:11.742
I'm just trying to help you out
with your form, that's all.

57:11.877 --> 57:16.248
So what you wanna do, put
your hand like right there...

57:17.249 --> 57:18.417
Right there?

57:18.550 --> 57:20.318
Yeah.

57:20.452 --> 57:22.953
Okay, we're gonna shoot
at the green ball right there.

57:23.088 --> 57:24.289
Alright.

57:24.423 --> 57:25.957
Put your hand right there.

57:29.026 --> 57:30.862
Okay.

57:30.995 --> 57:32.330
Now smoothly...

57:32.464 --> 57:34.899
hit it.

57:35.033 --> 57:36.835
Nailed it!
Totally!

57:36.968 --> 57:38.570
Couldn't do it
better myself.

58:20.111 --> 58:23.381
What?
Something wrong?

58:23.515 --> 58:24.883
Uh...

58:25.017 --> 58:26.518
Nah.

58:26.651 --> 58:27.986
Okay.

58:42.767 --> 58:43.702
What the fuck?

58:51.776 --> 58:53.511
Fucking Miles!

58:59.251 --> 59:01.453
Real fucking funny,
bro!

59:01.586 --> 59:02.954
Dude, what are you
talking about?

59:03.089 --> 59:05.490
You know exactly
what I am talking about!

59:05.624 --> 59:07.091
There has to be more
to this story.

59:07.225 --> 59:08.393
There's not.

59:08.526 --> 59:09.461
Then you explain
what's happening!

59:09.593 --> 59:10.662
How the fuck should I know?

59:10.796 --> 59:12.062
Things don't just move
on their own.

59:12.196 --> 59:13.798
That's the fucking truth!

59:13.932 --> 59:15.300
I think my dad's home.

59:15.432 --> 59:16.868
Staci? Randy?

59:17.002 --> 59:18.237
We're out here, Dad.

59:19.805 --> 59:21.306
Oh, hey guys.
I think the house is haunted.

59:21.439 --> 59:22.807
Oh, now hold on.
That's a big thing to say.

59:22.941 --> 59:25.910
My dresser moved.
It was so terrifying.

59:28.713 --> 59:29.915
Okay, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:30.048 --> 59:31.350
Slow down.

59:31.482 --> 59:33.919
Slow down. One at a time.
What did you see?

59:34.051 --> 59:35.754
They told us, Dad.

59:35.888 --> 59:37.256
Cody murdered his parents,

59:37.388 --> 59:38.823
and then his little sister,
and then himself.

59:38.957 --> 59:40.291
It had to have happened
in this house.

59:40.426 --> 59:42.294
Okay, sweetie,
if that were true,

59:42.428 --> 59:45.130
and I don't think it is because
Austyn would have told me,

59:45.263 --> 59:46.598
I don't it
has anything to do with

59:46.731 --> 59:48.300
what you say
is happening here.

59:48.432 --> 59:50.368
And what do you think
is happening here?

59:50.502 --> 59:52.471
Well, I wish I knew,
but at least nobody was hurt.

59:52.604 --> 59:54.573
At least no one got hurt?

59:54.705 --> 59:57.276
Are we gonna getting hurt?
No.

59:57.408 --> 01:00:00.578
- How do you know?
- Uh... because I just do?!

01:00:00.711 --> 01:00:02.713
Uh, well, we know for a fact
that this happened.

01:00:02.847 --> 01:00:06.685
Mm, we know for a fact
that it didn't happen here.

01:00:06.818 --> 01:00:08.653
How could you possibly
know that?

01:00:08.787 --> 01:00:10.022
Disclosure.

01:00:10.155 --> 01:00:12.923
What's that?

01:00:13.057 --> 01:00:15.926
Hold on a second.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:19.131
Disclosure...

01:00:19.263 --> 01:00:22.334
disclosure.

01:00:22.466 --> 01:00:24.169
Right here.

01:00:24.303 --> 01:00:27.573
None. Okay.
So what does that prove?

01:00:27.705 --> 01:00:31.109
Okay, well, if a murder
had taken place in this house

01:00:31.243 --> 01:00:36.081
they'd have to disclose it
prior to sale.

01:00:36.214 --> 01:00:37.883
It's a legal thing.

01:00:39.852 --> 01:00:43.022
So, no one was murdered
in this house?

01:00:43.155 --> 01:00:45.557
Well, I'd think you'd be
more happy than that, but yes.

01:00:45.691 --> 01:00:48.761
So no one died
in this house?

01:00:48.894 --> 01:00:50.562
Correct, genius.

01:00:52.497 --> 01:00:54.466
Then what's happening?

01:01:56.394 --> 01:01:57.562
Aah!

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:20.352
Jim.
Hello, David.

01:02:20.484 --> 01:02:21.753
Joan and I couldn't help
but notice

01:02:21.886 --> 01:02:24.323
Deputy Boyle
in your driveway last night.

01:02:24.455 --> 01:02:26.624
What, do you have a telescope
pointed at my house?

01:02:26.758 --> 01:02:29.828
Cody Harden,
ring a bell?

01:02:29.961 --> 01:02:32.396
Jim, what's this all about?
You tell me, David!

01:02:32.531 --> 01:02:35.467
I haven't the slightest.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.936
What if we
unwind the loan?

01:02:39.071 --> 01:02:41.806
West National Bank finance
your own loan, right?

01:02:41.939 --> 01:02:43.975
How do you know that?
I'm on the board.

01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:47.479
What do you say we unwind
the loan, less 10%,

01:02:47.611 --> 01:02:49.747
and then you
and your family can just...

01:02:49.881 --> 01:02:51.182
push on.

01:02:51.316 --> 01:02:52.484
You're a part of this.

01:02:52.618 --> 01:02:54.953
Part of what?

01:02:55.086 --> 01:02:57.722
Listen to yourself, Jim.

01:02:57.856 --> 01:03:00.359
I'm just a man
trying to do a job.

01:03:02.394 --> 01:03:03.962
Go fuck yourself,
David.

01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:09.333
That's rude.

01:03:09.468 --> 01:03:11.569
It's about time
you called.

01:03:11.702 --> 01:03:14.338
You sure know how to make
a girl doubt herself, don't you?

01:03:14.472 --> 01:03:19.678
You want a drink?

01:03:20.845 --> 01:03:23.649
What do you know
about my house?

01:03:25.015 --> 01:03:27.417
What do you mean?
Like square footage, or...?

01:03:27.551 --> 01:03:29.453
You ever heard of the name
Cody Harden?

01:03:29.586 --> 01:03:31.989
I mean, yeah,
everyone in this town has.

01:03:32.124 --> 01:03:34.158
And?

01:03:34.292 --> 01:03:35.694
And...

01:03:35.827 --> 01:03:38.662
he's some, like, psycho kid
who blew his chance

01:03:38.796 --> 01:03:40.231
at college
and shot his parents.

01:03:40.365 --> 01:03:42.267
Where did her live?

01:03:42.399 --> 01:03:45.102
Okay, I see
where this is going.

01:03:45.236 --> 01:03:47.071
Okay, he lived
in Francisco Oaks.

01:03:47.205 --> 01:03:49.707
I mean, I guess I could have
told you about it,

01:03:49.841 --> 01:03:51.843
but it was
a long time ago

01:03:51.975 --> 01:03:53.945
and it has absolutely nothing
to do with your sale.

01:03:54.078 --> 01:03:55.881
So he didn't live
in my house?

01:03:56.013 --> 01:03:57.682
What?! No!

01:03:57.816 --> 01:04:00.417
I mean, do you think
that I wouldn't tell you

01:04:00.551 --> 01:04:02.553
about
something like that?

01:04:02.687 --> 01:04:04.689
I mean, where is all this
coming from?

01:04:04.821 --> 01:04:08.158
There's just a lot
of strange things happening.

01:04:08.292 --> 01:04:09.727
Strange like what?

01:04:09.861 --> 01:04:14.566
Doors opening and closing
unexpectedly, cabinets...

01:04:16.901 --> 01:04:19.437
I mean,
it's a little exciting, no?

01:04:19.571 --> 01:04:21.706
My girls are having
a tough time with it.

01:04:21.839 --> 01:04:24.441
Are you sure
this is really happening?

01:04:24.575 --> 01:04:26.843
What do you mean
if I'm sure?

01:04:26.977 --> 01:04:29.647
I got it all on
security surveillance

01:04:29.781 --> 01:04:31.917
And you're sure
they're not, like, faking it?

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:33.184
Faking it?!

01:04:33.318 --> 01:04:35.352
I don't know.
You said your daughter, Staci,

01:04:35.486 --> 01:04:38.022
is, like, having a rough time
with the move and everything.

01:04:38.156 --> 01:04:39.291
Okay.

01:04:39.423 --> 01:04:41.725
Okay, so maybe
this is like her way

01:04:41.859 --> 01:04:43.227
of getting back at you,
or something?

01:04:43.361 --> 01:04:46.598
So you think my daughter
is faking it to punish me

01:04:46.731 --> 01:04:48.734
for making her move?

01:04:48.867 --> 01:04:50.267
Look, I'm just asking
a question, okay?

01:04:50.401 --> 01:04:52.303
I mean, you said that she is
a bit of a firecracker.

01:04:52.437 --> 01:04:54.004
I'm just, like, thinking
of some shit

01:04:54.138 --> 01:04:55.807
I might pull when
I'm that age, you know?

01:04:55.939 --> 01:04:59.610
I overlooked the paperwork
from the sale.

01:04:59.743 --> 01:05:02.481
There's nothing listed
under disclosures.

01:05:02.613 --> 01:05:04.948
That's because
there's nothing to disclose.

01:05:05.082 --> 01:05:08.153
Oh, so doors didn't open
and close unexpectedly

01:05:08.287 --> 01:05:09.788
previously to me moving in?

01:05:09.921 --> 01:05:11.723
Look, are you
fucking serious?

01:05:11.856 --> 01:05:13.124
Like, what do you think,
that your house is

01:05:13.258 --> 01:05:15.394
haunted or something
and I just knew about it

01:05:15.526 --> 01:05:17.227
- and didn't tell you?
- Did you?

01:05:17.361 --> 01:05:19.764
Look, you're out
of your fucking mind, okay?

01:05:19.897 --> 01:05:21.932
You live in a mansion
in Francisco Oaks!

01:05:22.066 --> 01:05:23.368
It's not like
some old plantation

01:05:23.502 --> 01:05:24.970
out in
the middle of nowhere.

01:05:25.102 --> 01:05:27.271
So you have nothing to tell me?
Oh, my God!

01:05:27.405 --> 01:05:30.408
Are you seriously really
asking me this right now?

01:05:30.542 --> 01:05:32.944
No, asshole!
Okay?

01:05:33.077 --> 01:05:35.646
Some murdering kid
didn't live in your house,

01:05:35.781 --> 01:05:37.950
and a satanic cult
didn't sacrifice virgins

01:05:38.082 --> 01:05:39.716
in your fucking basement
either.

01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:41.553
Honestly, look, this is...

01:05:41.685 --> 01:05:43.388
Can you just
get the fuck out?!

01:05:43.521 --> 01:05:44.789
Excuse me?

01:05:44.923 --> 01:05:46.758
You heard me!
Get the fuck out!

01:05:46.892 --> 01:05:49.194
I'm gonna ask you
one more time!

01:05:49.327 --> 01:05:51.463
And I'm gonna tell you
one more time!

01:05:51.595 --> 01:05:53.631
This is my family!

01:06:08.013 --> 01:06:11.049
Alright. You, uh,
you want us to come in?

01:06:11.182 --> 01:06:12.017
Wait, what?

01:06:12.149 --> 01:06:13.651
I think we're okay.
Yeah?

01:06:13.785 --> 01:06:15.520
My dad's home,
so we should be fine.

01:06:15.653 --> 01:06:16.921
- Sure?
- Yeah.

01:06:17.055 --> 01:06:18.757
Goodnight.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.562
Dad?

01:06:25.296 --> 01:06:26.798
Dad?!

01:06:26.932 --> 01:06:28.200
I don't think he's home.

01:06:28.332 --> 01:06:29.901
Ah, shit!

01:06:34.439 --> 01:06:37.207
Ah, damn it!

01:06:37.341 --> 01:06:38.709
Camp out in
the living room again?

01:06:38.843 --> 01:06:40.745
Definitely.

01:06:40.877 --> 01:06:43.314
At least we made it
to the bedroom this time.

01:06:43.448 --> 01:06:45.583
Yeah.

01:06:45.716 --> 01:06:47.285
It's nice.
Yeah?

01:06:48.953 --> 01:06:50.588
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I still like the couch.

01:06:50.722 --> 01:06:52.089
Mm.

01:06:52.223 --> 01:06:53.725
I'm gonna go
use your bathroom, okay?

01:06:53.857 --> 01:06:55.993
Okay, yeah, it's downstairs.
Okay.

01:08:27.517 --> 01:08:28.752
Staci?

01:08:35.426 --> 01:08:36.794
Staci?

01:08:40.497 --> 01:08:42.300
Staci?!

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:44.935
You sure you can't stay?

01:08:45.069 --> 01:08:48.805
No. My girls have already
called twice.

01:08:48.939 --> 01:08:53.176
I can't leave them
in that house alone.

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:54.779
Call me tomorrow?

01:08:54.912 --> 01:08:56.113
Yes.
Okay.

01:08:57.548 --> 01:08:58.749
Bye.

01:10:05.382 --> 01:10:07.551
<i>Dad!</i>

01:10:12.757 --> 01:10:13.658
<i>Dad!</i>

01:11:06.144 --> 01:11:08.980
<i>Staci!</i>

01:11:16.587 --> 01:11:18.522
Staci!

01:13:11.001 --> 01:13:13.870
Well, I think it's
pretty apparent from this footage,

01:13:14.004 --> 01:13:16.373
let alone the deposition
and the evidence

01:13:16.507 --> 01:13:19.411
that we... we had at the, uh,
at the Sheriff's place,

01:13:19.543 --> 01:13:21.645
the Placer Valley Sheriff's
Department.

01:13:21.779 --> 01:13:23.046
Placer County.
Yeah, yeah.

01:13:23.181 --> 01:13:25.450
We were there,
and we talked to people.

01:13:25.583 --> 01:13:27.752
We talked to, uh,
uh, Matt Bronson,

01:13:27.885 --> 01:13:32.256
we got a deposition from him,
uh, Marshal Miles,

01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:36.394
we talked to him twice,
and Deputy...

01:13:36.526 --> 01:13:37.528
Boyle.

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:39.364
I have it here.

01:13:41.664 --> 01:13:42.833
It's Deputy Boyle,

01:13:42.967 --> 01:13:45.370
who was on the premises
on the night in question,

01:13:45.503 --> 01:13:49.540
and he documented that
paranormal activity did happen

01:13:49.673 --> 01:13:50.740
at the Van Patton home.

01:13:50.874 --> 01:13:52.075
We've never denied that.

01:13:52.209 --> 01:13:53.645
What we are waiting on
is for you

01:13:53.778 --> 01:13:55.146
to produce any wrongdoing

01:13:55.279 --> 01:13:59.349
against Mr. Webster's client
and the bank.

01:13:59.484 --> 01:14:01.752
Alright, well,
you got me there.

01:14:01.886 --> 01:14:05.123
Luckily, we have recently come
into the possession

01:14:05.256 --> 01:14:07.091
of, uh, another video.

01:14:07.225 --> 01:14:12.195
This was anonymously given to
my client two, three days ago.

01:14:12.329 --> 01:14:14.030
I think you'll enjoy this.

01:14:17.068 --> 01:14:18.336
Where the fuck
did you get that?

01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:20.870
Apparently, your client
is not only aware

01:14:21.004 --> 01:14:25.443
of the existence of this video,
but she knows what it shows.

01:14:25.575 --> 01:14:28.678
Here we call it in the law
Consciousness of Guilt.

01:14:34.918 --> 01:14:36.653
Do it.

01:14:42.959 --> 01:14:44.729
That's final.

01:14:44.861 --> 01:14:46.230
Add a zero.

01:14:54.672 --> 01:14:56.207
Jim, wait.

01:14:58.175 --> 01:14:59.610
Let it go, Austyn.

01:14:59.743 --> 01:15:01.546
Jim, please, I really
do care about you.

01:15:01.678 --> 01:15:03.213
I'm sorry, I just...

01:15:03.346 --> 01:15:06.150
You care about me?

01:15:06.284 --> 01:15:09.254
You put the lives of
my daughters in jeopardy

01:15:09.387 --> 01:15:11.088
all so you could
turn a buck,

01:15:11.221 --> 01:15:12.589
and you are going to have
the audacity

01:15:12.723 --> 01:15:14.859
to tell me
you care about me?

01:15:14.992 --> 01:15:16.895
Look, I'm sorry.

01:15:17.028 --> 01:15:17.895
I get it.

01:15:55.499 --> 01:15:57.501
Is it done, Daddy?
Oh, yeah!

01:15:57.635 --> 01:16:01.338
It took a while, but the casino
finally cashed the check.

01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:08.812
Well, I guess it's time
to celebrate.

01:16:12.348 --> 01:16:13.717
Yes, it is.

01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:22.659
My God,
we fucking did it!

01:16:22.793 --> 01:16:24.394
Yeah, we did.

01:16:24.529 --> 01:16:26.064
This is heavier
than I thought.

01:16:26.196 --> 01:16:28.031
Yeah, each one's
like 23 pounds.

01:16:28.164 --> 01:16:30.467
Oh...

01:16:30.601 --> 01:16:32.570
I think I am going to need
your help with this.

01:16:32.703 --> 01:16:33.904
Help with what?

01:16:34.037 --> 01:16:36.473
Well, I've never been fucked
on a million dollars before.

01:16:36.606 --> 01:16:38.909
Ah, well, by all means,
I'll give you a hand.

01:17:07.872 --> 01:17:09.874
I can't believe you had
to fuck that old chick.

01:17:10.007 --> 01:17:14.078
Yeah. It's the only way I could
get the footage, baby.

01:17:14.212 --> 01:17:15.713
Why would she
even keep it?

01:17:15.846 --> 01:17:18.282
Oh, come on,
she's no dummy.

01:17:18.415 --> 01:17:22.787
She kept it for leverage
against the Mayor, bank.

01:17:26.690 --> 01:17:28.358
Bury this.

01:17:28.492 --> 01:17:31.628
Yeah, the important thing
is we got it.

01:17:31.762 --> 01:17:33.565
Did you
enjoy fucking her?

01:17:33.698 --> 01:17:35.767
Oh, yeah.

01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:42.306
It's not funny.
No.

01:17:42.439 --> 01:17:44.842
Ah...
there's only you, baby.

01:17:44.975 --> 01:17:46.343
Really?
Yeah.

01:17:50.181 --> 01:17:51.449
I'll get it.
Okay.

01:17:51.582 --> 01:17:53.751
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let me get some pants on.

01:18:01.357 --> 01:18:02.360
Is that it?

01:18:02.493 --> 01:18:04.361
Yes, it is.

01:18:08.766 --> 01:18:10.835
Oh, that better be
your cut.

01:18:12.401 --> 01:18:13.770
It's my cut.

01:18:13.904 --> 01:18:16.874
I told Daddy I wanna go fuck
on a million dollars.

01:18:17.007 --> 01:18:18.374
So it's done?

01:18:18.507 --> 01:18:19.542
We fucking did it?

01:18:19.677 --> 01:18:21.746
We did it.

01:18:21.878 --> 01:18:24.547
It's time to celebrate.

01:18:24.681 --> 01:18:28.551
The two of yous
were masterful.

01:18:28.686 --> 01:18:29.821
You weren't so bad
yourself.

01:18:29.954 --> 01:18:31.222
Oh, well, thank you.

01:18:31.355 --> 01:18:32.922
The owner's at the point
that he's willing

01:18:33.056 --> 01:18:35.658
to just sell the house
at any asking price.

01:18:35.793 --> 01:18:37.828
It's like the minute
I mention the murders,

01:18:37.962 --> 01:18:40.030
people just freak out
and walk.

01:18:40.163 --> 01:18:41.764
So what's the plan?

01:18:41.899 --> 01:18:45.369
Honestly, I'm about to just say
fuck it, and not tell anyone.

01:18:45.503 --> 01:18:47.037
Fail to disclose?

01:18:47.171 --> 01:18:49.807
You could lose your license for that!
Oh, well.

01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:52.543
The way you guys figured out
and sold those scare gags,

01:18:52.676 --> 01:18:55.046
it was... it was perfect!

01:18:55.178 --> 01:18:57.347
It was...
It was mind blowing!

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.581
It wasn't hard.

01:18:58.716 --> 01:18:59.950
Just a bunch of mono films

01:19:00.083 --> 01:19:01.618
and watching a shit ton
of horror movies.

01:19:01.752 --> 01:19:03.553
Yeah, but that footage,
that last night,

01:19:03.687 --> 01:19:05.455
that footage,
that spooky shit?

01:19:05.588 --> 01:19:07.156
I'm a believer now.

01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:09.694
Well, it's about time, because
I was getting pretty sick

01:19:09.827 --> 01:19:11.995
and tired of you shitting
all over our hauntings.

01:19:12.128 --> 01:19:15.065
Ah, no, no, no, no,
no, don't do that, no, no, no.

01:19:15.199 --> 01:19:17.801
Don't get me wrong, opening
and closing the doors was great.

01:19:17.935 --> 01:19:19.035
It was great.

01:19:19.168 --> 01:19:21.004
But we needed something to
you know,

01:19:21.137 --> 01:19:22.406
raise the settlement.

01:19:22.539 --> 01:19:25.007
You know, but that footage,
I'm telling you,

01:19:25.141 --> 01:19:28.444
that footage, it's gonna be
an urban legend in that town.

01:19:28.579 --> 01:19:29.880
Mark my words.

01:19:30.013 --> 01:19:31.882
Yeah, it will.
It better be.

01:19:32.015 --> 01:19:34.452
They're gonna fucking
talk about it forever.

01:19:38.355 --> 01:19:40.990
Robin would have loved
those shadows.

01:19:41.123 --> 01:19:43.694
I wish she was here for this one.
Mm.

01:19:45.395 --> 01:19:46.629
To Robin.

01:19:46.763 --> 01:19:48.365
Best grifter I ever knew.

01:19:48.498 --> 01:19:49.399
Yeah.

01:19:54.538 --> 01:19:57.342
You played a great dad
in this one.

01:19:59.275 --> 01:20:00.943
Thank you.

01:20:01.078 --> 01:20:05.749
But, uh, oh man, I was...
I was nervous without her.

01:20:05.882 --> 01:20:10.052
I mean she always played the
mom grift, like, so good, right?

01:20:10.988 --> 01:20:13.356
I mean, she really knew
how to sell it.

01:20:13.489 --> 01:20:15.124
Mm.
Yeah.

01:20:15.257 --> 01:20:17.693
She was fearless.

01:20:17.828 --> 01:20:19.296
Don't sell yourself short.

01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:21.098
You were a wonderful widower.

01:20:21.231 --> 01:20:24.133
You really screwed over
that real estate bitch.

01:20:24.267 --> 01:20:26.069
She fell for you so hard.

01:20:26.204 --> 01:20:27.472
Oh,
she has superb taste.

01:20:29.271 --> 01:20:31.207
Now I'm a charmer.

01:20:31.342 --> 01:20:34.245
Goddamn you will.

01:20:34.378 --> 01:20:36.513
So, uh, heading off
to the city?

01:20:36.646 --> 01:20:38.114
Yeah. Tomorrow.

01:20:38.248 --> 01:20:39.516
What about you two?

01:20:39.650 --> 01:20:42.386
Daddy's taking me to Paris.

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:43.687
Yeah, we're gonna cruise
around Europe.

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.656
You should come.
Nah.

01:20:45.788 --> 01:20:49.926
I'm road tripping,
gotta figure some things out.

01:20:52.462 --> 01:20:57.033
Well, we will see you
at the next adventure.

01:20:58.034 --> 01:21:00.037
Yeah. Sure.

01:21:11.181 --> 01:21:14.919
So, we did it.

01:21:15.052 --> 01:21:17.888
It wasn't the same
without you.

01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:22.058
I don't it's ever going to be
the same without you.

01:21:22.193 --> 01:21:25.195
I guess it's time for me
to become what you were for me

01:21:25.329 --> 01:21:28.432
all these years ago.

01:21:28.565 --> 01:21:31.635
I was just lost.

01:21:31.769 --> 01:21:33.869
Turning tricks for drugs.

01:21:34.003 --> 01:21:37.675
It seems like
a different person.

01:21:40.843 --> 01:21:44.213
You gave me strength.

01:21:44.347 --> 01:21:47.417
You gave me confidence.

01:21:47.551 --> 01:21:49.419
You gave me hope.

01:21:53.923 --> 01:21:57.260
I guess I need to find someone
that I could do that for,

01:21:57.394 --> 01:22:00.297
pay it forward, you know?

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:05.069
I miss you.

01:22:07.637 --> 01:22:09.473
I hope you're happy.

01:22:12.008 --> 01:22:14.845
I'm gonna head
back to the city now,

01:22:14.979 --> 01:22:17.848
but we'll talk again soon.

01:22:17.981 --> 01:22:19.649
I promise.

01:23:18.275 --> 01:23:19.976
Hey.

01:23:21.678 --> 01:23:23.713
I don't know what I'm gonna do
without you.

01:23:23.846 --> 01:23:26.117
Make sure you kill them...

01:23:27.484 --> 01:23:29.218
...before they kill you.

01:24:22.886 --> 01:24:24.386
