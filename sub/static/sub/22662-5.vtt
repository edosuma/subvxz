By Churchill. By the fucking King.

going to stop a revolution?

42:03.320 --> 42:05.800

my invitation to dinner.

42:05.880 --> 42:08.121
(SCOFFS) Oh, of course. I'm sorry.

42:08.200 --> 42:11.522
Tommy Shelby is gonna stop
the revolution with his cock.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.728
It's not her
the military are interested in.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.290

want to help the British military?

three five-year contracts

These two beauties
were shot this morning

46:11.600 --> 46:13.284

46:13.680 --> 46:15.728
at Lord Packwood's estate.

46:16.080 --> 46:18.845
I thought you'd like that. These here,

46:19.760 --> 46:22.764
these were stolen from under his trees.

46:26.040 --> 46:29.283
Mr Shelby, I came to talk business.

46:29.480 --> 46:30.766
Yes.

46:31.320 --> 46:32.924
So did I.

46:38.160 --> 46:42.722
Wage cuts withdrawn, parity between
men and women guaranteed.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.731
You can instruct your members

46:47.960 --> 46:49.405
And all I have to do in return

46:49.480 --> 46:51.608
is tell you everything I know
about socialism.

46:51.960 --> 46:53.724
That's what your sister said.

46:55.600 --> 46:57.090
You don't like your gin?

46:58.880 --> 47:00.211
It's okay.

47:01.760 --> 47:02.966
It's okay.

47:05.960 --> 47:08.008
What do you want to know
about the cause?

47:11.280 --> 47:14.250
I'm approaching
the current political crisis

47:14.600 --> 47:17.365
as I would approach a horse race.

47:19.640 --> 47:22.120
Assessing the runners and the riders.

47:25.440 --> 47:28.683
Now the favourite is,
of course, the King's horse,

47:30.520 --> 47:33.763
but the King's horse
was also the favourite in 1913

47:33.920 --> 47:36.605
when Emily Davison
threw herself in front of it.

47:36.680 --> 47:38.728
You know the names of Suffragettes?

47:39.560 --> 47:40.891
I'm impressed.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.606
Ah, everyone laughed at them at first,
but now look,

47:44.440 --> 47:46.761
women with serious faces everywhere.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.606
When I study a horse race, I study form,

47:53.240 --> 47:57.325
and on the other horse, the one
that wants to beat the King's horse,

47:59.640 --> 48:03.247
let's call her "Dangerous", shall we?
She's no form.

48:03.840 --> 48:06.241
- That's what makes her so dangerous.
- Russia.

48:07.080 --> 48:09.082
- Isn't that form?
- Ah.

48:09.480 --> 48:13.087
The Russians are not like the English.
We're beer, they're petrol.

48:14.480 --> 48:16.448
So I invited you here for dinner,

48:18.280 --> 48:20.248
because you know people.

48:21.440 --> 48:25.684
People that want to make this fight
real with guns and ammunition.

48:26.960 --> 48:29.691
So before I place a bet
on who's gonna win,

48:30.520 --> 48:32.329
I need to know how strong they are.

48:32.840 --> 48:34.251
How serious they are.

48:35.960 --> 48:39.089
Your concern is
that if the unthinkable happened,

48:40.280 --> 48:43.363
you would find yourself
on the wrong side of the barricades.

48:44.400 --> 48:46.323
Well, as you can see,

48:47.040 --> 48:51.648
my natural side of the barricades,
is the same as yours and, as you know,

48:53.400 --> 48:55.129
I once believed...

48:56.280 --> 48:57.930
But the war changed you?

49:00.320 --> 49:01.606
Yeah.

49:05.200 --> 49:07.521

when he got back.

49:08.200 --> 49:09.645
Not one word.

49:24.760 --> 49:26.000
I do.

49:26.760 --> 49:28.762
- Well, well.
- Yes.

49:29.160 --> 49:31.686
Notjust in my dreams. In the day now.

49:33.200 --> 49:34.804

49:38.520 --> 49:39.806
Well, well.

49:42.320 --> 49:43.970
I've researched you.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.170
We have researched you.

49:49.080 --> 49:51.401
You've never been a friend
to the government.

49:51.720 --> 49:53.404
They've used you.

49:54.440 --> 49:58.001

that no amount of money allows you

49:58.080 --> 50:01.448
