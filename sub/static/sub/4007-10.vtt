00:10.440 --> 00:11.760
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:11.920 --> 00:15.072
If I do happen to find her,
you'll get your reward money.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.680
Ah, shit.
Who's that?

00:16.840 --> 00:17.876
Federal marshal.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.197
Dexter Morgan, what the hell
are you doing here?

00:20.360 --> 00:21.476
Arlene's a friend.

00:21.640 --> 00:24.030
We met through Hannah.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.034
It's not safe for you to go back to the hotel.
You need something private.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.395
What the fuck?

00:28.560 --> 00:31.029
It's only for a couple of nights.
Couple of nights? That's it.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.634
Sorry I'm not Deb.

00:32.840 --> 00:35.992
She's always accusing me
of comparing you to her.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.196
Welcome back
to Homicide, detective.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.273
I just need some time
to think about it.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.755
Take all the time you need.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.957
There's no life for me here
in Florida.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.510
I can have a life somewhere else
far away from here--

00:50.680 --> 00:52.990
In Argentina.
Maybe we all can.

00:53.160 --> 00:57.040
Yes. Me, you, and Harrison
are gonna move to Argentina.

00:57.240 --> 01:01.393
Zach's killer is related to you.
The Brain Surgeon is related to you.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.517
I had two sons,
Daniel and Richard.

01:03.680 --> 01:06.798
My older son, Daniel...
He killed Richard.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.957
Then we put Daniel into
a mental health institute.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.679
That guy Cassie was dating...

01:12.200 --> 01:14.431
Daniel Vogel is Oliver Saxon.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.115
Suppose you do find him, Dexter.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.270
What are you going to do?

01:18.440 --> 01:21.558
He's murdered four innocent people,
and he killed Zach Hamilton.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.359
He's my son.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.920
He got away.
That's why I'm here, to warn you.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.914
I think it best, from here on out,
that I handle this myself.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.118
<i>Vogel is on her own, and so am I.</i>

01:34.320 --> 01:37.472
<i>I'll kill Saxon
and leave Miami forever.</i>

01:38.960 --> 01:41.316
So now do you believe me?

01:41.680 --> 01:43.034
Yes.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.040
Feels good to cook
for you again.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.752
It reminds me of what
it was like to be your mother.

03:51.280 --> 03:55.320
You think fixing breakfast
makes you my mother again?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.878
No.
You gave up that privilege

03:58.040 --> 03:59.235
a long time ago.

04:00.120 --> 04:03.113
Daniel, whatever mistakes
I've made in the past,

04:03.280 --> 04:05.795
I want to make it up to you.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.236
I can help you.
Help me how?

04:08.400 --> 04:10.915
I can arrange
for the care you need.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.151
The care I need?

04:13.880 --> 04:17.112
I will never be locked up again.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.158
I have contacts
at the best facilities.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.795
Like the last one
you sent me to?

04:21.959 --> 04:24.475
Do you know what
that was like?

04:24.640 --> 04:27.838
Day after day wondering
when you'd finally come to visit,

04:28.000 --> 04:29.912
only to realise
that the answer was never.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.631
Daniel, I couldn't.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.589
You'd killed Richard.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.514
That was your fault.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.631
You ignored me.

04:42.480 --> 04:46.030
All you ever cared about
was Richard.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.839
You never tried to help me.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.276
I was young, inexperienced.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.597
I didn't know how to help you.

04:55.760 --> 04:59.276
But you sure as hell knew
how to help Dexter Morgan.

04:59.480 --> 05:02.314
You taught him how to deal
with his condition.

05:02.480 --> 05:05.712
You gave him everything
you denied me.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.590
While I was rotting away,
you gave him a life.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.116
I know that. I do.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.555
It was a horrible mistake.

05:14.160 --> 05:15.992
I was your son.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.309
I needed you.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.037
Please...
Please what?

05:21.200 --> 05:24.034
Let me help you.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.351
I'm sorry for everything I've done.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.319
I truly, truly am.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.396
I wish I could believe you.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.710
Hannah.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.837
Hey, Harrison.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.600
Oh, I missed you. Aw.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.434
Hey, soon you'll be able to spend
all the time you want with her,

06:03.600 --> 06:06.274
but right now, Hannah and I need
to have a grown-up talk.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.671
Okay, bud?
Okay.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.194
So...

06:14.360 --> 06:16.317
some potentially good news.
Yeah?

06:16.520 --> 06:18.432
Deputy Marshal Clayton
stopped by my place.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.559
It seems like he's backing off
on his search for you.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.359
Oh, that's a huge relief.

06:23.520 --> 06:27.116
Even so, he managed to get your face all over the news.
You still need to lay low.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.236
So how am I gonna
get out of Miami?

06:30.960 --> 06:35.273
Well, no one's looking for a woman
travelling with her husband and child.

06:35.440 --> 06:39.195
I'm thinking the three of us
could leave together.

06:40.440 --> 06:41.760
I like the sound of that.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.110
There's still so much to do.

06:47.280 --> 06:52.036
I've gotta tell Batista I'm leaving,
get Harrison out of school,

06:52.200 --> 06:54.271
see Astor and Cody
one last time.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.877
I need to list my condo,
sell my boat, my car.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.876
Deb can help out
with all that stuff.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.509
Wow. Heh, heh.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.034
We're really gonna do it.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.550
Yeah.
We're moving to Argentina.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.794
God, that was always
such a fantasy,

07:11.960 --> 07:14.316
I never thought that
it would actually happen.

07:14.480 --> 07:17.234
Otherwise I would have
learned Spanish.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.754
We'll learn together.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.151
We'll be leaving soon.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.198
I have to kill Saxon first.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.232
Oh, so you are gonna
go through with it.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.476
I have to.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.154
Vogel's not thinking clearly.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.471
She doesn't seem to realise
she's in danger.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.319
I feel like I need to protect her.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.358
You feel like you need to?

07:38.440 --> 07:40.079
Yeah.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.037
What?
Oh, it's just...

07:43.200 --> 07:45.351
when it comes to you
and killing,

07:45.520 --> 07:47.830
feelings never enter
the equation.

07:51.240 --> 07:52.469
She needs me to protect her.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.675
Hey!
Stay off Aunt Deb's treadmill.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.194
But it's fun.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.158
No, it's not for kids.
Hey, come here.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.551
I wanna hear about what you've been
doing for the last eight months.

08:04.720 --> 08:05.710
Okay.

08:09.240 --> 08:13.029
Hi, Aunt Deb.
Hi.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.320
Come on.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.274
Can we talk?

08:23.360 --> 08:25.920
What the hell is Harrison
doing with Hannah?

08:26.080 --> 08:28.197
Deputy marshal
pulled off the detail.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.596
It's not safe for Harrison
to be at the apartment

08:30.760 --> 08:32.159
as long as Saxon's
still out there.

08:32.360 --> 08:36.070
Okay, then I'll watch him, but he shouldn't be with her.
That's not fucking fair to him.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.429
I have to tell you something.

08:38.480 --> 08:39.470
What?

08:39.640 --> 08:42.109
Harrison and I are leaving soon.

08:42.840 --> 08:43.876
What do you mean,
you're leaving?

08:44.080 --> 08:46.675
You're leaving where?
Leaving Miami

08:46.880 --> 08:48.360
with Hannah.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.560
What are you talking about?
We're moving to Argentina.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.477
Are you kidding?

08:57.320 --> 08:58.879
You know how stupid
that sounds?

08:59.040 --> 09:01.475
Deb--
You're gonna take your fucking son,

09:01.680 --> 09:03.637
move to another country
with a wanted fugitive?

09:03.800 --> 09:05.553
Have you fucking
thought this through?

09:05.720 --> 09:07.712
Deb, I have.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.193
We wanna have
a life together.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.631
I wish there was a different way,
but there's not.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.872
We need to leave the country
and start someplace new.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.391
You act like this
doesn't even affect me.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.391
I know it does.

09:29.080 --> 09:32.118
Well, then, that's a really
selfish decision on your part.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.600
We'll still see each other.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.438
I'll come up here,
and you can visit.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.951
Okay, I'll look you up
the next time I'm in Argentina.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.839
Deb, I'm sorry.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.794
This is hard for me too.

09:51.880 --> 09:55.669
Hey. How was your day?
Long.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.913
Aww.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.753
Well, I had a really good day.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.631
Not only am I about
to graduate,

10:02.800 --> 10:07.875
but I got a recruitment letter
from Greenwood Academy.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.595
A therapist position.
What's Greenwood Academy?

10:10.760 --> 10:15.391
It's a very well respected special-needs school in Atlanta.
They want to set up an interview.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.631
That's fucking great.
When you going?

10:18.920 --> 10:19.956
I'm not.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.480
What do you mean? Why not?

10:24.120 --> 10:26.430
Joey, I'm not moving
to Atlanta when you're here.

10:26.640 --> 10:27.915
I'll find something in Miami.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.630
I'm just so flattered
that they're interested.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.395
Jamie, I would feel like shit

10:34.560 --> 10:37.314
if I was the cause of you
missing out on a great opportunity.

10:38.280 --> 10:41.796
You shouldn't.
This is my decision.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.918
All I'm saying is, you know, you
should do what's best for your career.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.478
What about us?

10:50.040 --> 10:52.430
Don't worry about us,
you know?

10:52.600 --> 10:54.671
We'll make it work.

10:55.560 --> 10:58.234
Be right back.
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.509
Evelyn.
Tom.

11:10.680 --> 11:11.796
Please.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.710
Everything okay?

11:14.880 --> 11:16.792
Yes, fine.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.633
A little over-worked, so...

11:18.800 --> 11:21.110
Mm. Thanks for coming in
this morning.

11:21.320 --> 11:24.040
As I said, it's kind
of a sensitive matter.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.197
It's about one of your patients.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.476
Zach Hamilton.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.359
As I'm sure you're aware,
he's gone missing.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.160
Yes. I was hoping he'd turned up by now.
He hasn't.

11:32.320 --> 11:36.439
And I promised his parents
that I would look into it personally.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.000
But I'm afraid I've hit a dead end.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.720
Tom, you know that I'm not at liberty
to discuss my patients.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.758
Come on, Evelyn,

11:42.920 --> 11:44.957
I'm trying to help this kid.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.077
Now, he lived at home. How was his
relationship with his parents?

11:49.240 --> 11:50.720
Like anyone his age.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.951
Did he say anything
about trying to get away?

11:53.120 --> 11:55.635
He talk about any friends,
maybe a special girl?

11:55.800 --> 11:59.111
Was he into drugs? Gambling?

11:59.320 --> 12:01.516
Was he suicidal?
I don't know.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.593
Look, I know you understand
better than anyone

12:04.760 --> 12:06.035
what it's like to lose a child.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.430
Not knowing is even worse.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.751
Imagine how the Hamiltons
must feel.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.433
I wish I could help,
but I just don't know any more.

12:17.160 --> 12:20.153
I'm sorry, but I have
another appointment.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.039
<i>Saxon killed his brother
when he was only 14.</i>

12:33.200 --> 12:36.591
<i>Killed seven more in the fire
when he was 17.</i>

12:36.760 --> 12:38.035
<i>How many more since then?</i>

12:39.480 --> 12:42.473
<i>He's lived in a dozen cities
across two continents.</i>

12:43.040 --> 12:46.192
<i>Never been arrested.
Never leaves a trace.</i>

12:46.600 --> 12:50.150
<i>Is he the perfect psychopath
I once was?</i>

12:55.840 --> 12:58.230
Dr. Vogel.
Dexter.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.676
Can we talk?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.673
What are you doing here?

13:05.840 --> 13:08.833
Tom wanted to question me
about Zach.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.593
Well, of course,
I couldn't tell him anything.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.160
But I feel horrid

13:13.320 --> 13:15.277
keeping Zach's death
from the Hamiltons.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.870
And we both know
that Zach's killer is still out there.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.800
Understand, Evelyn,
you are in danger.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.318
Well, you don't have to worry.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.314
My son isn't gonna harm me.

13:29.520 --> 13:32.274
How do you know that?
I just do.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.476
Have you been
in contact with him?

13:37.680 --> 13:38.670
I saw him.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.790
When?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.474
We had breakfast yesterday.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.630
Where is he now?

13:49.120 --> 13:50.440
I have no idea.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.275
Evelyn...
It's the truth.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.114
He-- He was angry and
he stormed out of the house.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.716
I don't know whether
I'll ever see him again.

14:01.920 --> 14:02.910
Why didn't you tell me?

14:03.360 --> 14:06.034
Because you want
to kill him.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.880
And I don't want that
to happen.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.950
I can't turn my back
on him again.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.277
What is there
you can do for him?

14:17.600 --> 14:19.398
Well...

14:20.600 --> 14:23.672
First, I can establish trust.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.918
I wasn't a good mother to him
when he was a child.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.673
I need to win him over.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.073
And then...

14:33.240 --> 14:35.994
Well, eventually, hopefully,

14:36.440 --> 14:37.874
I'll get him back into a facility.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.120
And how many more
innocent people will he kill

14:41.280 --> 14:43.192
before you do that,
before he kills you?

14:43.400 --> 14:46.438
If you won't protect yourself,
I need to do it.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.958
I don't want you
to protect me, Dexter.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.554
I don't want you to be a hero.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.074
Evelyn, I have to--
Please.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.233
Don't use me as an excuse
for killing Daniel.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.437
She doesn't want my help.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.952
So do I just walk away from this?

15:14.120 --> 15:15.918
We could leave
for Argentina tonight.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.958
Dexter, you don't want
to leave this unfinished.

15:18.120 --> 15:19.793
I don't even know
how to find him.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.952
You always find a way.

15:22.120 --> 15:26.751
If you don't kill Saxon,
her life is at risk.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.156
Crime scene.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.230
You can send it back,
you know.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.436
It's not the salad.

15:42.600 --> 15:46.674
So you asked me here
to watch me eat?

15:49.280 --> 15:52.114
You can't tell
anybody this, okay?

15:55.760 --> 15:56.910
Dexter is leaving Miami.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.719
Why? He's quitting?

15:58.880 --> 16:01.315
He and Harrison are gonna take
the rest of the year and travel.

16:01.520 --> 16:05.912
Fucking A. Good for him. Or not.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.551
I don't know if he's ever
coming back, you know.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.598
I mean, I get wanting
a change, but--

16:10.760 --> 16:14.549
Sometimes, you know,
when things don't feel right,

16:14.720 --> 16:17.519
changing it up is better
for everyone involved.

16:17.680 --> 16:20.240
It's not better for me.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.073
He's my brother.
I don't want him to leave.

16:22.240 --> 16:26.280
I understand, but maybe you should
think about what's best for him.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.714
Look, when I left New York,

16:29.920 --> 16:31.354
it was one of the toughest things
I ever did,

16:31.520 --> 16:33.477
leaving my friends and family.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.911
But as it turns out,
finally being on my own

16:36.080 --> 16:37.719
was the best thing
I ever did for myself.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.633
Batista gave me
my badge back.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.200
Fucking A, that's great.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.310
Or not.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.670
It's good. It's good.

16:56.840 --> 17:00.231
I've wanted to come back
for a long time, so...

17:00.400 --> 17:03.598
You tell Elway?
Not yet.

17:04.079 --> 17:05.400
You know what this means, right?

17:06.560 --> 17:08.517
You and me, side by side.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.191
Just like old times.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.280
Seriously?
Yeah.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.715
It's a crime scene.
Gotta go.

17:20.880 --> 17:21.950
No, I got it, I got it.

17:22.119 --> 17:25.909
Okay.
Next one's on me, partner.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.596
<i>Nothing will change after I'm gone.</i>

17:36.760 --> 17:38.797
<i>Blood will continue to pool.</i>

17:40.880 --> 17:43.520
<i>I just won't be here to photograph it.</i>

17:43.680 --> 17:45.876
The guy was hit
pretty hard.

17:46.080 --> 17:49.152
Major head wounds,
lots of broken bones,

17:49.320 --> 17:50.470
internal injuries.

17:50.640 --> 17:51.676
Road rage.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.678
The guy on the bike wouldn't
get out of the way,

17:53.880 --> 17:56.873
gave him the finger,
so the driver ran him over.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.838
Lieutenant, can I get a word?
Sure.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.230
Hey, Dex.

18:02.600 --> 18:06.150
I didn't know I had to work today.
Why would you think that?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.832
Because it's Saturday.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.156
Are you high?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.397
You're high, aren't you?
I can smell it on you.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.760
Go home.
Dad...

18:18.920 --> 18:21.799
We'll talk about this later. Go.
And stop smoking pot.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.192
You have every right
to tell me what to do at work,

18:24.360 --> 18:26.716
but you have no right
to tell me what to do at home.

18:28.240 --> 18:33.031
Well, that's--
That's a huge shock, Dexter.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.874
I know it seems like
it's out of the blue,

18:36.040 --> 18:38.157
but after Rita's death...

18:39.320 --> 18:40.720
and with the job,

18:40.880 --> 18:45.159
I've just had enough death
in my life for a while.

18:45.320 --> 18:49.997
I need a break, so...
This is my notice.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.479
You need this, don't you?

18:56.800 --> 18:59.031
I wish you nothing but the best.
Thank you.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.357
I'd like to keep this between us.

19:01.520 --> 19:05.878
I'd like to let other people
know myself, Jamie included.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.553
She's gonna take it hard.
You know, she really loves Harrison.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.916
He loves her too.

19:12.440 --> 19:15.000
Anyway,
she's moving on herself.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.674
New job soon.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.479
Maybe this'll make it easier.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.275
I'll miss you, bro.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.915
Hey, listen, and...
If you change your mind,

19:34.080 --> 19:36.072
you always have a home here.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.800
Got it.
Okay.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.235
He said, "I'm too big for a nap,"
and then he went right to sleep.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.156
Heh. Cute.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.874
So are you any closer
in your search for Saxon?

19:58.480 --> 20:00.233
Not really.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.436
I don't know much
about him.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.512
He moves around a lot.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.916
I guess he figures if you stay
in one place too long...

20:06.080 --> 20:08.959
Eventually you get caught.

20:11.160 --> 20:13.231
I wish we could just leave.

20:13.440 --> 20:17.957
Yeah, me too, but I know that
you have to protect Dr. Vogel.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.716
Actually,
she doesn't want me to.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.758
Then why are you doing this?

20:28.720 --> 20:30.677
Because it's what I do.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.958
It's who I am. It's all I know.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.713
Dexter, you're more than that.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.433
Am I?

20:42.600 --> 20:44.876
You think that when
we move to Argentina...

20:47.200 --> 20:50.796
that it's possible for you and me
to have a fresh start?

20:51.200 --> 20:52.714
Yes.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.678
Well, then, the sooner
you kill Saxon,

20:54.840 --> 20:57.355
the sooner
we can get there.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.751
Vogel is the key.
I'm sure he'll go for her.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.515
But I can't just sit
and watch her.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.752
Especially if she figures out
that you're watching her.

21:11.920 --> 21:14.640
That can make things worse.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.157
I need to find him,
but maybe I don't need Vogel.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.471
Just her computer.

21:38.960 --> 21:42.715
I want you to see something.
Get in.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.076
I'm not gonna hurt you, Mom.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.318
Trust me,
if I wanted you dead,

21:51.480 --> 21:52.880
I wouldn't be holding
this door.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.350
Do you recognise this
from the video I sent you?

22:39.360 --> 22:41.238
This is where you kill
your victims.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.400
Why did you bring me here?

22:46.560 --> 22:48.040
To help you understand.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.319
Have a seat.

22:53.760 --> 22:58.232
Don't worry,
I wiped it down after every, uh--

22:59.000 --> 23:00.514
Well...

23:09.440 --> 23:12.353
This room is more than
what you think it is.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.039
It's a reminder.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.673
Of what?

23:21.280 --> 23:23.192
Where you sent me.

23:26.080 --> 23:30.393
I've made it look exactly like what
they called our treatment room.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.191
When I would refuse
to take my meds,

23:36.360 --> 23:40.513
the doctors would strap me
down into a chair like this...

23:41.880 --> 23:44.600
and they would force
the meds down.

23:46.200 --> 23:50.399
And that was usually
the highlight of my day.

23:53.320 --> 23:56.791
You can see why
I caused that fire.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.800
I can see why
you would do anything

24:00.000 --> 24:02.834
to get out
of a place like this.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.471
You said before
that you wanted to help me.

24:11.880 --> 24:14.554
Yes. I'd like that.

24:15.160 --> 24:17.595
Most facilities aren't
like this, Daniel.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.434
I could put you someplace where

24:20.640 --> 24:23.678
you'd be very comfortable.
I could see you every day.

24:23.840 --> 24:25.877
I want you to help me
like you helped Dexter.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.519
I want you to show me how
to exist free in the world

24:30.680 --> 24:32.080
just the way I am.

24:32.280 --> 24:33.714
As a killer?

24:36.320 --> 24:39.757
Daniel, I can't help you
to murder innocent people.

24:42.040 --> 24:44.555
If you care about me
the way you say you do,

24:46.280 --> 24:49.000
you'll figure out a way
to make this work.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.557
I want to be someone
you can love.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.835
I'm asking you,
as your son...

25:00.160 --> 25:01.355
please help me.

25:15.320 --> 25:18.836
All right, I'll find a way.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.799
What about Dexter?
He's still after me.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.076
I'll talk to Dexter.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.591
Don't make the same mistake
you made with Richard.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.873
Choose right this time.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.394
Choose me.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.274
I'll get Dexter to understand.

25:38.440 --> 25:39.840
Do you think
that's possible?

25:40.000 --> 25:41.957
I'll make it possible.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.600
I want this, Daniel.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.350
I want to be
your mother again.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.834
I'll do whatever it takes.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.837
Vogel told me where
she keeps a spare key

26:13.000 --> 26:14.400
in case of an emergency.

26:14.560 --> 26:18.156
I think protecting her from
her deranged son qualifies.

26:26.640 --> 26:29.474
Saxon installed spyware
on her computer.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.232
Thing is, that can go both ways.

26:32.440 --> 26:35.512
So if Saxon can see
Vogel's computer...

26:37.320 --> 26:39.596
Then I can see Saxon's.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.869
So, what are you looking for?

26:42.040 --> 26:45.670
Something, anything
that can give me an edge.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.599
What's this?

26:56.400 --> 26:58.869
That's the video he sent to Vogel.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.712
And this one's from last week.

27:07.880 --> 27:10.998
<i>No, don't!</i>
Zach.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.640
<i>No, no!
What are you doing? No!</i>

27:14.040 --> 27:15.599
<i>No! No!</i>

27:25.960 --> 27:29.795
Dexter, if something happens
to Evelyn, it will haunt you forever.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.074
You can't just run off to Argentina
and escape who you are.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.072
I'm not trying to escape anything.

27:40.520 --> 27:43.399
So you'll post a job listing
next week?

27:43.560 --> 27:47.315
Great. Listen, I just don't
need any forensic tech.

27:47.480 --> 27:50.200
Hey, I need the best out there.
He's filling some big shoes.

27:50.360 --> 27:52.033
I appreciate it.

27:52.520 --> 27:53.840
Sorry, deputy.
How can I help you?

27:54.000 --> 27:57.391
Just came by to let you know none of
our leads on Hannah McKay panned out.

27:57.560 --> 28:00.792
You know, when the trail goes cold at this
point, the subject either was never here,

28:01.360 --> 28:02.874
or skipped town pretty fast.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.794
So, what does that mean?
It means the case is back to low priority.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.519
Okay.
Thanks for the heads up.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.512
Uh-- I couldn't help overhearing.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.831
You said you're looking
for a new forensic tech.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.350
You know someone?
No, I'm just curious--

28:14.520 --> 28:16.273
Who's leaving?
It's not Dexter Morgan, is it?

28:16.440 --> 28:18.272
Close the door.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.190
He hasn't told any of his friends yet,

28:23.360 --> 28:26.239
so this is on the QT,
but, yes, Dexter's moving on.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.073
He got a better job, huh?

28:28.240 --> 28:30.311
No, he's going to travel,
spend time with his son.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.830
Really?
Yeah. I can't say I blame him.

28:41.400 --> 28:44.313
Hey, babe.
How was your day?

28:44.480 --> 28:47.439
It was okay. You working?

28:47.600 --> 28:49.956
Yeah, I'm just
sending out résumés.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.038
I'm almost done though.

28:55.400 --> 29:00.600
Hey, um, can we talk
for a sec?

29:01.600 --> 29:03.239
Okay.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.756
I feel like an asshole,
but I gotta be honest with you.

29:06.440 --> 29:10.150
Okay, so be honest.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.353
It's not working out
between us, is it?

29:18.520 --> 29:20.398
Is that a question?
No.

29:20.560 --> 29:23.632
It's-- I'm sorry.

29:25.080 --> 29:28.198
Then why did you
let me move in here?

29:30.440 --> 29:32.272
I mean, why wait
until now, Joey?

29:32.440 --> 29:34.955
I hoped it would
make things better.

29:36.520 --> 29:37.795
I don't know what else to say.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.357
Ugh, I am so stupid to think
you would ever get over Deb.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.591
It's got nothing to do with Deb.

29:44.920 --> 29:46.513
I thought you wanted
to be honest with me.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.951
I am. This is on me.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.834
She's got nothing
to do with it.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.560
Joey, see, that is
what hurts the most.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.235
That you just keep lying about it.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.634
I'm not lying, Jamie.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.314
Okay, you know what?
Don't worry.

30:01.480 --> 30:04.075
I'm gonna move my stuff
out of here as soon as I can,

30:04.280 --> 30:06.078
so you're free to not go back to Deb.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.150
Jamie--

30:08.320 --> 30:09.879
Bye.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.631
Just give me a sec.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.476
Hey.

30:57.680 --> 31:00.479
I don't want to intrude.
Well, it's your house.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.959
It's your family.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.792
It's your family too.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.237
I want you and Harrison
to be happy.

31:25.440 --> 31:29.957
So how do you feel
about us leaving?

31:33.160 --> 31:34.560
Scared.

31:36.240 --> 31:38.630
My whole family's moving.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.433
Scared?

31:46.040 --> 31:48.032
You've always been there.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.356
I don't know what my life
looks like without you.

31:53.640 --> 31:56.951
Well, maybe it looks better.

31:57.120 --> 31:58.713
Really?

32:00.240 --> 32:03.711
Hanging out with two serial killers,
does it get better than that?

32:03.880 --> 32:05.473
So you see my point.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.199
I don't know.

32:13.320 --> 32:15.277
Better or worse...

32:17.960 --> 32:19.553
you've always been there.

32:22.160 --> 32:25.232
Moving on without you
feels like jumping off a cliff.

32:26.400 --> 32:28.517
I know what you mean.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.280
Come on.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.276
Will you?

32:54.600 --> 32:56.592
Hey, look who's here.

33:15.880 --> 33:19.157
Hi.
<i>Hi. Just checking in.</i>

33:19.320 --> 33:20.310
All is well here.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.392
Harrison's playing outside
with Deb.

33:22.600 --> 33:26.116
Oh, good.
<i>You doing okay?</i>

33:26.280 --> 33:29.239
Yeah, I just wanted to hear your voice.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.674
I have to go.

33:40.080 --> 33:41.400
Evelyn.
Dexter.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.199
I was hoping
we could talk.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.194
Okay.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.158
I've been rethinking
what I said earlier,

33:48.320 --> 33:51.597
and I fear I was being
too judgemental.

33:51.800 --> 33:54.838
I think it's possible that you and
Hannah could have a relationship.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.437
Really?
And I think moving far away,

33:58.640 --> 34:01.678
beginning anew might be
the best thing for you.

34:01.840 --> 34:05.356
Moving far away?
Is that the important part?

34:05.560 --> 34:09.520
You mentioned Argentina?
That could be a good place.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.080
Why do you want me to leave?

34:11.239 --> 34:15.359
Dexter, I think
there's hope for Daniel.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.955
I don't think he likes killing.

34:18.159 --> 34:19.753
I could help him,

34:19.920 --> 34:22.480
but I'm not gonna get
that chance if you kill him.

34:24.560 --> 34:27.553
So just leave, please.
Leave Miami.

34:27.719 --> 34:30.315
You don't think he likes killing?
He says he wants my help.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.676
Let me show you how much
he doesn't like killing.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.748
<i>No, don't! No!</i>

34:43.600 --> 34:44.954
No.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.951
That's Zach's head
he's sawing into.

34:51.639 --> 34:54.474
There's no hope for him, Evelyn.

34:55.120 --> 34:58.033
This is the same person
who killed your younger son.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.799
He will never change.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.475
Don't.
I'm sorry.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.079
So, what now?

35:21.720 --> 35:23.598
You know what needs to happen.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.920
Otherwise, he'll go on killing.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.389
Where is he now?

35:32.560 --> 35:35.712
He said he would call me tonight.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.793
Set up a meeting with him tonight.

35:38.960 --> 35:42.317
Someplace public, safe.

35:42.480 --> 35:44.949
Call me and let me know where.

35:45.160 --> 35:48.119
I'll follow him and take it from there.

35:58.480 --> 36:01.473
Just please don't let him suffer.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.000
I won't.

36:16.960 --> 36:18.917
Debra Morgan.

36:20.640 --> 36:23.758
Do I know you?
Deputy U.S. Marshal Max Clayton.

36:23.920 --> 36:24.990
And this is Harrison.

36:25.560 --> 36:26.960
Hey, buddy.
Hi.

36:27.160 --> 36:30.597
You guys have met?
Over at his dad's, yeah.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.797
Harrison,
why don't you go inside?

36:33.000 --> 36:34.719
I'll be there in a minute.

36:34.920 --> 36:36.400
Okay.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.799
Elway gave me your address.
I thought it better we talk in person.

36:43.320 --> 36:44.310
Okay.

36:46.200 --> 36:49.591
Look, I'm worried about your brother.
Dexter? Why?

36:50.320 --> 36:53.711
It's probably nothing,
but it just struck me as odd

36:53.880 --> 36:56.634
that he's leaving town
at the exact time

36:56.800 --> 36:58.951
Hannah McKay is
rumoured to be here.

36:59.120 --> 37:02.397
How do you know he's leaving?
Uh, overheard at the station.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.871
Maybe it's nothing, but

37:05.040 --> 37:08.272
are he and Arlene Shram
a couple?

37:08.440 --> 37:10.352
I don't know. I don't keep up
with his dating life.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.877
Okay, it's just I know he used to have
a relationship with Hannah McKay.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.398
What if he still does?

37:16.560 --> 37:18.517
Then he's a fucking idiot.
That's what I'm afraid of.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.399
Look, I know I'm going out
on a limb here,

37:20.560 --> 37:24.395
but what if these two
somehow reconnected?

37:24.560 --> 37:25.914
I mean,
his life could be at risk.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.912
His son's too.
Dexter wouldn't do that.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.673
I hope not.

37:29.840 --> 37:32.355
I don't need to tell you what a
dangerous person Hannah McKay is.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.280
You know more about her than I do.
If Dexter were dating Hannah McKay,

37:35.480 --> 37:36.630
I would fucking know about it.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.280
Maybe he'd keep it from you.
Who knows?

37:38.480 --> 37:40.870
I mean, men do stupid things
for beautiful women.

37:41.040 --> 37:42.997
Logic just flies out the window.

37:43.160 --> 37:47.677
Well, I appreciate your concern,
but that's not what's happening here.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.672
Dexter's burned out,
that's why he's leaving.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.638
Okay. Thank you.

37:51.800 --> 37:54.474
I respect your opinion.
Here's my card.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.997
You call me if you think of anything.
Okay, I will do.

38:11.160 --> 38:13.117
Hey. You guys hungry?

38:13.280 --> 38:14.270
Yea h!

38:14.440 --> 38:16.671
Hey, go clean up, Harrison.

38:20.880 --> 38:21.950
Is everything okay?

38:22.840 --> 38:24.194
Not really.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.800
Something happen?

38:25.960 --> 38:27.599
Deputy Marshal Clayton happened.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.717
He was just questioning me
on the beach.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.395
I thought that Dexter said
that Clayton was backing off.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.155
Somehow he found out that Dexter's
leaving, and it tweaked him.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.232
He thinks Dexter's helping you hide.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.357
Oh, God.
I covered for both of you,

38:39.520 --> 38:41.352
but you have got
to stay hidden until you leave.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.477
Of course. Yes.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.074
Oh...

38:46.400 --> 38:49.871
Thank you for protecting me,
again.

38:52.360 --> 38:54.636
Who knew I'd be so good at it?

38:55.240 --> 38:57.880
We'll all be out of here soon.
I know.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.032
I have lunch.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.350
No, thanks.

39:02.520 --> 39:04.512
I have someplace I need to be.

39:14.960 --> 39:18.431
Hey.
Hey.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.831
Can we talk?
Nothing to talk about.

39:21.040 --> 39:22.759
I know why you're here.
I'll have your last cheque drawn.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.872
I was gonna give you two weeks.
Don't want your two weeks.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.316
I still have friends in Miami Metro,
they said you were going back.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.960
Well, shouldn't we talk
about this?

39:29.120 --> 39:31.112
I went out of my way
to make this work.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.839
I put up with your bullshit.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.912
The more I gave,
the more you pushed back.

39:35.080 --> 39:37.231
It's quite clear to me that it
was never gonna work out.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.558
Well, I'm sorry.

39:42.480 --> 39:45.234
I really appreciate the job

39:45.440 --> 39:46.920
and everything
that you've done for me.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.400
Don't mention it.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.398
Let's just, uh...

39:54.280 --> 39:55.953
Okay.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.554
I'm gonna go pack up
my office.

39:58.720 --> 40:01.519
I'll have security do that.
They'll deliver it to your house.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.797
And all the case files
are mine, of course.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.320
Including those
on Hannah McKay.

40:07.480 --> 40:10.393
Good luck to you.
Yeah, you too.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.118
Harrison, remember
what your dad said. That's not a toy.

40:18.280 --> 40:19.999
But Aunt Deb does it
all the time.

40:24.040 --> 40:25.599
Harrison, please listen.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.759
I am.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.273
Ow!

40:38.200 --> 40:39.190
Harrison!

40:42.160 --> 40:46.313
Ow! Ow! Ow!
I know. It's gonna be okay.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.474
Ow.
I know it hurts.

40:49.640 --> 40:52.280
I know it hurts.
It's gonna be okay.

40:52.440 --> 40:54.511
Okay.
Ow.

40:54.720 --> 40:57.633
Here, hold that.
Ouch.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.837
Ow.

41:01.680 --> 41:03.080
<i>Dexter Morgan.</i>

41:03.240 --> 41:04.515
Dexter, call me.

41:08.160 --> 41:11.870
We're gonna have to take you
somewhere and get you patched up.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.998
What happened?
He fell and hit his chin.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.032
It's a pretty deep cut.
It won't stop bleeding.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.998
I'll let the doctor know.
Are you the mother?

41:24.440 --> 41:25.999
Are you the mother?
Uh, yes.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.356
I'm just waiting for his father
to call me back.

41:28.520 --> 41:29.715
Fill this out.
Okay.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.274
And wait for us
to call his name.

41:31.440 --> 41:32.999
Okay. Thank you.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.112
Harrison,
you're being so brave.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.715
I can't wait to tell your dad.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.680
Harrison Morgan?

42:09.360 --> 42:10.919
Uh, yeah.

42:11.080 --> 42:12.434
Here.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.956
Been a while
since we've been here.

42:30.120 --> 42:33.431
Choir director.
Long time ago.

42:39.920 --> 42:42.230
Saxon's first victim.

43:03.720 --> 43:06.189
And his last victims.

43:07.400 --> 43:10.313
It's also been a while since
you've used victims' pictures.

43:12.640 --> 43:14.791
He needs to see
what he's done.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.919
That was always
very important to you.

43:18.080 --> 43:20.993
People get
what they deserve.

43:21.840 --> 43:23.832
At least they should.

43:25.640 --> 43:28.280
Huh. I've come a long way.

43:28.440 --> 43:32.434
It feels like I'm a different person
from the last time I was in this room.

43:33.120 --> 43:34.474
You're still you, Dexter.

43:34.640 --> 43:36.199
I hope you realise that.

43:36.360 --> 43:39.000
Why wouldn't I?

43:39.160 --> 43:42.153
I just don't want you to have
any unrealistic expectations

43:42.320 --> 43:43.879
about whatever happens next.

43:44.600 --> 43:48.150
I know exactly what happens next.

43:48.320 --> 43:50.755
I kill Saxon.

43:50.920 --> 43:56.120
And then Hannah and Harrison and I
get on a plane and start our new lives.

44:07.320 --> 44:09.915
Hey, Jamie.
Go fuck yourself.

44:10.120 --> 44:13.397
What?
Debra, come on in.

44:18.360 --> 44:20.920
I'm ready to come back,
if you'll have me.

44:21.080 --> 44:22.196
If I'll have you?

44:23.520 --> 44:25.876
Are you sure about this?
You're not fooling me?

44:26.040 --> 44:28.350
Uh, I don't think so.

44:28.560 --> 44:30.279
Well, in that case, hallelujah.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.036
Can you start today?

44:32.200 --> 44:35.079
I was thinking more like
a week or two.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.596
Of course. Loose ends.

44:37.760 --> 44:39.035
Yeah, something like that.

44:39.600 --> 44:43.355
Mm-hm. Well, whenever
you're ready, I'm ready.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.116
It's funny, though.
What?

44:46.280 --> 44:48.351
You coming back
as Dexter's leaving.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.520
He told you?
Yeah.

44:50.680 --> 44:53.320
And, yeah, don't worry
about Jamie.

44:53.480 --> 44:55.790
What was that?
Oh, you don't know?

44:56.000 --> 44:58.117
Quinn just ended things with her.
Stupid idiot.

44:58.280 --> 44:59.794
He did?
And so you know,

44:59.960 --> 45:01.360
Jamie kind of blames you.

45:02.080 --> 45:03.309
Yeah, I get that.

45:03.480 --> 45:05.870
Yeah, she thinks Quinn is still in
love with you or something like that.

45:06.040 --> 45:08.236
I didn't want to know
the details.

45:12.200 --> 45:14.669
I'll let you have at him first.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.075
We need to talk.

45:24.760 --> 45:27.434
I just did what--
Not here.

45:27.600 --> 45:30.399
Did you break up with her
because of me?

45:30.560 --> 45:33.029
No. Yes.

45:33.200 --> 45:36.352
I mean, no and yes.
Don't get all mad.

45:36.520 --> 45:37.920
Your face gets red
when you get mad.

45:38.080 --> 45:39.958
No, it doesn't.
What the fuck happened?

45:40.480 --> 45:43.598
It's not complicated.
I wasn't happy.

45:43.800 --> 45:47.510
I mean, I was okay, but I kind of
knew I was never gonna marry her.

45:47.720 --> 45:49.518
Probably would have
ended it soon anyway,

45:49.720 --> 45:51.632
even if what happened
between you and I didn't happen.

45:51.800 --> 45:53.757
Nothing happened.
We shared a kiss.

45:53.920 --> 45:56.276
That's not a reason to fucking
break up with somebody.

45:56.480 --> 45:57.470
You're not hearing me.

45:57.680 --> 46:00.036
I probably would have
broke up with Jamie,

46:00.200 --> 46:02.078
but what happened
between you and I

46:02.280 --> 46:05.956
just made it clear that
I shouldn't be with her anymore.

46:06.120 --> 46:09.796
Got it?
Yes.

46:09.960 --> 46:13.556
So, yeah, to be completely honest,

46:13.720 --> 46:16.360
I still have feelings for you,

46:16.520 --> 46:18.876
But I don't expect anything from you.

46:19.040 --> 46:20.554
Why not?

46:20.720 --> 46:22.598
Because I didn't think you wanted--

46:22.800 --> 46:25.315
I still have feelings for you,
stupid.

46:26.920 --> 46:29.037
That didn't change, I just--

46:29.960 --> 46:32.475
I wasn't sure
that I saw a future for us.

46:32.680 --> 46:33.830
What about now?

46:34.320 --> 46:36.915
I don't know.
I mean, I used to...

46:37.720 --> 46:40.952
I used to feel like something
was holding me back, but now--

46:41.120 --> 46:44.113
Now I just-- Shh.

46:51.360 --> 46:53.477
Are you sure it was Hannah
McKay you saw earlier today?

46:53.640 --> 46:55.359
Yeah. I'd seen her picture
on the news.

46:55.520 --> 46:57.671
She brought in her son.
He had a cut on his chin.

46:57.840 --> 46:59.399
Hannah McKay
doesn't have any children.

46:59.560 --> 47:02.234
Are you sure this is her?
Well, I think so.

47:02.400 --> 47:03.390
What was her boy's name?

47:03.760 --> 47:05.911
His name
was Harrison Morgan,

47:06.080 --> 47:08.436
and she sure acted
like he was her own.

47:15.760 --> 47:17.752
I fell on my chin.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.355
Yeah, how many stitches
are holding that chin together?

47:20.560 --> 47:23.234
Six.
Wow. I bet that hurt.

47:23.440 --> 47:26.399
Yeah, but Harrison
was very brave.

47:26.560 --> 47:29.473
I even got a lollipop.
Can I go play now?

47:29.640 --> 47:31.313
Yeah, sure.

47:34.840 --> 47:36.194
Thanks for taking care of him.

47:36.360 --> 47:38.670
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I feel awful.

47:38.840 --> 47:42.311
I can't believe I wasn't here for you.
You went out in public.

47:42.480 --> 47:45.154
You put yourself in jeopardy
because I was setting up a kill room.

47:45.320 --> 47:48.631
Dex, you didn't know.
It doesn't matter.

47:49.760 --> 47:53.356
I'm trying to save Dr. Vogel when I should
be taking care of you and Harrison.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.639
We're okay, really. It's fine.

47:56.480 --> 47:58.995
But there is one other thing.
What?

47:59.160 --> 48:01.117
That deputy marshal came by.
Here?

48:01.280 --> 48:04.990
He talked to Deb. I think she put him off, but
still, we can't stay here for much longer.

48:06.360 --> 48:07.396
I know.

48:11.360 --> 48:14.637
Evelyn?
<i>Dexter, he's here.</i>

48:14.800 --> 48:16.280
Here? Where's here?

48:16.440 --> 48:19.319
At my house. He called me.

48:19.480 --> 48:20.960
Said he was a couple
of blocks away.

48:21.120 --> 48:22.474
No, that wasn't the plan.

48:22.640 --> 48:25.633
You were supposed to meet him
someplace in public. Someplace safe.

48:25.840 --> 48:28.639
It's the last time
I'm ever going to see him.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.399
I wanted a private goodbye.

48:30.560 --> 48:32.870
<i>It's not a good idea.</i>

48:34.680 --> 48:36.637
That's him now.
<i>Evelyn?</i>

48:40.920 --> 48:42.479
What?

48:43.240 --> 48:45.232
I have to go.

48:45.600 --> 48:48.195
Well, be careful.
I will.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.310
Dexter, go.
What if the marshal comes back?

48:59.480 --> 49:01.756
He's not coming back.
It's Evelyn who needs you right now.

49:01.920 --> 49:03.798
I should stay here with Hannah.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.798
This is exactly
what Vogel warned you about.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.356
You're trying to live in two different
worlds, and it's got you paralysed.

49:08.520 --> 49:11.160
I'm not paralysed.
I'm making a choice.

49:11.320 --> 49:14.199
Son, you're choosing
to be afraid,

49:14.360 --> 49:17.319
because for the first time in your life,
you think you've got something to lose.

49:17.480 --> 49:19.870
Is that who you
wanna be?

49:25.360 --> 49:28.194
Oh. That's all right.
I'll do it.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.678
I'm getting old.

49:31.840 --> 49:34.639
My aim isn't as good
as it used to be.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.037
Why'd you want
to see me tonight?

49:45.720 --> 49:49.157
I just thought it would be
nice for us to talk...

49:49.680 --> 49:52.320
about normal things.

49:52.480 --> 49:53.914
Unlike the other couple
of times.

49:54.080 --> 49:56.436
Mm. Of course.

50:02.760 --> 50:04.991
What's wrong?
Wrong?

50:05.160 --> 50:06.879
You seem tense.
No.

50:07.040 --> 50:10.351
No, not at all.
I'm very comfortable.

50:11.160 --> 50:14.551
Maybe a little tired,
under the circumstances.

50:20.360 --> 50:21.840
Is there something
you want to tell me?

50:27.480 --> 50:29.870
I just wanted to see you.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.914
Heh. Guess I'm sounding
like a mother already...

50:37.240 --> 50:39.038
constantly wanting
her son around.

50:45.440 --> 50:47.113
You know...

50:48.800 --> 50:51.395
when you see as many people
die as I have,

50:52.920 --> 50:54.957
you know when they're afraid.

50:56.320 --> 50:58.277
What are you afraid of,
Mother?

51:04.960 --> 51:06.235
<i>He's still here.</i>

51:10.440 --> 51:12.830
<i>Hello, Dexter.</i>
What do you want? Where--

51:13.000 --> 51:15.469
<i>Don't move.
I want to show you something.</i>

51:19.440 --> 51:20.669
Don't touch her.

51:20.840 --> 51:23.594
Mother chose
the wrong son, again.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.552
Evelyn?

51:36.720 --> 51:38.439
Oh, no, no, no.

51:38.600 --> 51:40.114
No...
