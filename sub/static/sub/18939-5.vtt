01:22.292 --> 01:24.875
Good evening,
and welcome to <i>Lachrymose News,</i>

01:24.958 --> 01:28.125
where things that are happening
keep happening until they stop.

01:28.208 --> 01:30.292
Not unlike the plight
of the Baudelaire orphans,

01:30.375 --> 01:32.625
whom, viewers will recall,
lost their parents

01:32.708 --> 01:34.833
and their home in a terrible fire.

01:34.917 --> 01:37.375
With the latest update
on their dire plight

01:37.458 --> 01:39.833
is our co-anchor Vincent Fig Demetrios.

01:39.917 --> 01:41.583
- Vincent?
- Thanks, Veronica.

01:41.667 --> 01:43.792
Viewers will recall
that following the fire,

01:43.875 --> 01:46.292
the Baudelaires were sent
to live with Count Olaf,

01:46.375 --> 01:49.917
a villainous actor and an active villain
who has vowed repeatedly

01:50.000 --> 01:53.833
that he will stop at nothing
to get his hands on the enormous fortune

01:53.917 --> 01:55.750
the Baudelaire parents left behind.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.542
Let's hope so, Vincent.

01:57.625 --> 02:00.667
Coming up next,
some very nice people were poisoned.

02:00.750 --> 02:02.500
But first, the weather.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.542
If the story of the Baudelaire orphans
were a weather report,

02:07.625 --> 02:10.208
there would be hardly any sunshine
to be seen.

02:10.292 --> 02:13.083
Instead, there would be
cloudbursts of unhappiness.

02:13.583 --> 02:15.000
Blizzards of despair.

02:15.792 --> 02:17.917
Misery in the form of sleet storms.

02:18.542 --> 02:20.542
Various cold fronts of terror.

02:21.333 --> 02:22.208
Horror.

02:22.917 --> 02:24.000
Attacks of allergies.

02:25.083 --> 02:29.833
Not to mention the threat of a devastating
hurricane lurking just off the map.

02:32.083 --> 02:35.167
<i>If you didn't know about the Baudelaire
orphans' unfortunate history</i>

02:35.250 --> 02:37.500
<i>and you saw them disembark</i>
<i>from the</i> Fickle Ferry

02:37.583 --> 02:38.917
<i>and arrive at Damocles Dock,</i>

02:39.000 --> 02:41.125
<i>you might think
they were bound for an exciting adventure.</i>

02:41.208 --> 02:43.083
Here we are, Baudelaires. Deemo...

02:43.167 --> 02:44.792
- But you would be dead wrong.
- Dimmo...

02:44.875 --> 02:46.833
- My name is Lemony Snicket.
- Dudy Damo...

02:46.917 --> 02:48.875
- It's my sad duty...
- Democlay...

02:48.958 --> 02:51.042
to tell the tale
of the Baudelaires' tragic lives.

02:51.125 --> 02:52.125
Dimoclath...

02:52.208 --> 02:54.167
But you likely have
no such responsibilities...

02:54.250 --> 02:56.417
- Dimoclat...
- And should escape from this sad story...

02:56.500 --> 02:58.667
- Demcaca...
- before another storm of melancholy

02:58.750 --> 03:01.458
- engulfs you in dampness and misery.
- Dock.

03:01.958 --> 03:03.583
It's pronounced Damocles.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.583
After the probably apocryphal figure
in Sicilian mythology.

03:06.667 --> 03:09.417
Well, I don't have time to learn things.
The banking day has already begun.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.625
In any case, I'm sure you'll be off
on some exciting adventure

03:11.708 --> 03:12.708
with your new guardian.

03:13.292 --> 03:16.792
Remember, you can always rely on us
at Mulctuary Money Management.

03:16.875 --> 03:17.875
Now, if you'll excuse me,

03:17.958 --> 03:20.208
I will leave you alone
on this mostly deserted dock

03:20.292 --> 03:23.250
to await for your taxi
to your Aunt Josephine's house.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.333
She's not meeting us here?

03:24.417 --> 03:26.667
Strangely, she said
she'd be unable to come to the dock,

03:26.750 --> 03:28.792
and I didn't think it polite to ask why.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.167
Perhaps she's planning
a surprise party for you children.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.500
Which reminds me,

03:33.083 --> 03:35.000
I know you've had
a frightening and mystifying time

03:35.083 --> 03:37.375
with that horrible man, what, um, Count...

03:37.875 --> 03:39.792
- What's his name? Um...
- Olaf.

03:39.875 --> 03:42.792
Olaf. Who knows where he came from?

03:42.875 --> 03:44.250
You put us in his care.

03:44.750 --> 03:46.500
I wouldn't exactly call it care.

03:46.583 --> 03:49.958
He's a thief and a murderer,
and so far has completely escaped capture.

03:50.042 --> 03:52.625
But I have the thing
that just might turn things around.

03:54.625 --> 03:55.875
Peppermints!

03:56.250 --> 03:59.958
Delicious peppermints!
My second favorite candy when I was a boy.

04:00.042 --> 04:02.500
You can eat them in the taxi
on the way to meet your dowager aunt.

04:02.583 --> 04:05.208
- What's that?
- Oh, Violet, I'm surprised at you.

04:05.292 --> 04:07.083
A girl your age should know
that a taxi is a car

04:07.167 --> 04:08.833
that takes you someplace
for a reasonable fee.

04:08.917 --> 04:11.417
And this should just about cover it.

04:11.750 --> 04:14.792
Cheers, Baudelaires!

04:16.333 --> 04:17.375
Good luck.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.417
- "Dowager" is a fancy word for widow.
- Thank you.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.708
Should we have told him
we're allergic to peppermints?

04:28.833 --> 04:30.458
It didn't seem worth mentioning.

04:30.542 --> 04:32.417
We have a lot more important things
on our minds.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.500
Like asking Aunt Josephine
if she can help explain

04:34.583 --> 04:37.292
all the strange and mysterious things
that keep happening to us.

04:37.375 --> 04:38.583
And how to get a taxi.

04:41.708 --> 04:43.875
Does anyone need a ride somewhere
for a reasonable fee?

04:48.500 --> 04:52.167
- This town doesn't seem very crowded.
- It's the off-season.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.083
When the weather's nice,
this town is as crowded as can be.

04:55.167 --> 04:57.875
But around now, things are as dead
as the cat I ran over this morning.

04:57.958 --> 05:00.000
Hold on.

05:03.667 --> 05:05.625
I hope your Aunt Josephine
has enough food and supplies

05:05.708 --> 05:08.000
when Hurricane Herman arrives.
It's supposed to be a doozy.

05:08.083 --> 05:10.917
I'm gonna sit it out in a cabin
with the works of Herman Melville

05:11.000 --> 05:12.958
and a large pot of vegetarian chili.

05:13.042 --> 05:15.375
I thought hurricanes only occurred
near oceans.

05:15.458 --> 05:18.708
With a body of water as large
as Lake Lachrymose, anything can happen.

05:20.917 --> 05:23.500
You know, what's interesting is
the storms in Herman Melville's work

05:23.583 --> 05:25.542
are more metaphorical,
or even allegorical,

05:25.625 --> 05:27.833
rather than the naturalistic style
of someone like Thoreau,

05:27.917 --> 05:28.958
if you know what I mean.

05:29.042 --> 05:32.625
The shore represents our tenuous hold
on the earthly nature of mortal existence,

05:32.708 --> 05:34.208
and the turbulent waters represent

05:34.292 --> 05:36.417
the villainy and troubles
in our own lives.

05:36.500 --> 05:41.333
Like a threatening rowboat getting closer
and closer with each passing moment.

05:41.417 --> 05:43.875
Solitude.

05:43.958 --> 05:47.708
Blissful contemplation of my inward eye.

05:47.792 --> 05:51.583
Only when I am alone can I court the muse

05:51.667 --> 05:54.125
and dream up the next step in my...

05:54.208 --> 05:56.583
...glorious scheme.

05:56.667 --> 05:59.250
And what is
the next step, boss?

05:59.333 --> 06:00.375
Brute force?

06:00.458 --> 06:03.292
No, no. I need something
worthy of this grandiose locale.

06:03.375 --> 06:05.292
Something dashing, something romantic.

06:05.375 --> 06:08.417
You know, in many ways,
I am married to the sea.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.167
This is actually a large lake.

06:10.250 --> 06:14.042
I am married to the sea,
but my girlfriend is a large lake.

06:14.125 --> 06:17.583
- Land ho!
- I told you to stop calling me that.

06:17.667 --> 06:20.792
I'd say to him, "Lay off
the big white whale for a few days.

06:20.875 --> 06:23.042
See how you feel.
Take a vacation. Rest your leg."

06:23.125 --> 06:24.208
Wow!

06:24.292 --> 06:28.083
Your aunt must be a remarkable lady
to live all the way up here by herself.

06:28.167 --> 06:30.833
We've been told
Aunt Josephine is fierce and formidable.

06:30.917 --> 06:31.792
She must be.

06:35.667 --> 06:37.417
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

06:44.167 --> 06:47.042
I hope she really can answer
all of our questions.

06:47.125 --> 06:48.375
There's so much we don't know.

06:48.458 --> 06:50.708
It's like we're standing
on the edge of a precipice

06:50.792 --> 06:52.708
with no idea what lies below.

07:10.083 --> 07:12.167
In fact, it was exactly like that.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.917
Although I do know what lies below,

07:14.000 --> 07:18.042
which is a 300-foot drop into
the freezing waters of Lake Lachrymose.

07:19.917 --> 07:24.208
Still, standing on a precipice is better
than slipping on a precipice,

07:24.292 --> 07:26.000
or falling over a precipice.

07:26.083 --> 07:28.292
So, before things get worse,

07:28.375 --> 07:30.917
I would advise that you take note
of the three words

07:31.000 --> 07:34.542
the Baudelaires were about to find
on Aunt Josephine's front door.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.750
"Please go away."

07:44.458 --> 07:47.167
Don't knock. You might get splinters.

07:47.250 --> 07:51.500
This door is made of wood,
which is teeming with tiny shards,

07:51.583 --> 07:55.333
which in turn is teeming with infection.
You must never knock.

07:55.417 --> 07:57.500
I'm sorry.
I'm sure you're right about all of that.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.292
We're looking for our Aunt Josephine.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.875
I'm Violet Baudelaire,
and these are my siblings...

08:00.958 --> 08:05.792
Klaus and Sunny, of course, of course.
Come in. Come in!

08:05.875 --> 08:09.375
- The doorbell didn't appear to be working.
- It's disconnected.

08:09.958 --> 08:12.083
There is the danger of electrocution.

08:12.167 --> 08:14.417
And be careful
not to bump into the phone.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.125
I've read quite a bit about electricity,

08:16.208 --> 08:20.958
and I'm reasonably certain
that doorbells and telephones are safe.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.708
Not if you have a faulty pacemaker.

08:22.792 --> 08:25.292
Does someone here have a faulty pacemaker?

08:25.375 --> 08:27.375
No, but you can never be too careful.

08:27.420 --> 08:28.434
Oh boy.

08:28.458 --> 08:30.500
Do you live with our Aunt Josephine?

08:30.583 --> 08:32.375
I am your Aunt Josephine.

08:36.625 --> 08:38.917
- You are?
- Yes, of course.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.750
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

08:41.832 --> 08:45.167
Although, I prefer the word "certain."
Follow me.

08:45.250 --> 08:48.083
But mind the rug.
You might trip and break your necks.

08:49.792 --> 08:51.458
Fierce Aunt Josephine.

08:51.542 --> 08:53.375
Formidable Aunt Josephine.

08:53.927 --> 08:55.927
Crazy Aunt Josephine.

08:56.583 --> 08:59.792
"Delmo"?
What do you mean by "Delmo"?

08:59.875 --> 09:02.000
I consider myself an expert
on the English language,

09:02.083 --> 09:04.583
and I have no idea
what the word "Delmo" means.

09:04.667 --> 09:08.208
Sunny doesn't speak fluently yet.
Just baby talk, mostly.

09:08.292 --> 09:11.958
Well, you have arrived just in time.

09:12.042 --> 09:14.667
I know you've seen many unusual things.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.958
- Yes, we have.
- And you must have many questions.

09:18.042 --> 09:19.958
- Yes, we do.
- In my library,

09:20.042 --> 09:23.167
you will find all the answers
that you need.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.208
- Are you ready?
- We're ready.

09:25.708 --> 09:28.542
Then open the door.

09:29.583 --> 09:32.750
Ah! Just... just push on the wood.

09:32.833 --> 09:36.875
The knob could shatter
into a million pieces and hit your eyes!

09:52.750 --> 09:54.500
Lake Lachrymose.

09:54.583 --> 09:58.708
I know every island in its waters
and every cave along its shores.

09:59.792 --> 10:02.750
But now I can only stand to look at it
from far away.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.958
That's why I couldn't meet you
on the docks.

10:06.042 --> 10:08.292
I'm too haunted by the past.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.458
Does this have anything to do
with our parents?

10:10.542 --> 10:13.708
Certainly not.
It has to do with my husband...

10:13.792 --> 10:18.000
Ike. He was my best friend, my partner,

10:18.083 --> 10:22.042
and one of the few people I knew who could
whistle with crackers in his mouth.

10:22.125 --> 10:24.458
His specialty was
Beethoven's fourth string quartet.

10:24.542 --> 10:26.375
- Our mother could do that.
- Her specialty

10:26.458 --> 10:28.208
was Mozart's 14th symphony.

10:28.292 --> 10:30.375
Yeah, that's right.

10:30.458 --> 10:33.792
We were all friends,
your parents and Ike and me.

10:33.875 --> 10:36.458
We used to gather
on these shores for picnics

10:36.542 --> 10:38.958
and to develop our own secret codes.

10:39.042 --> 10:43.583
- Our parents developed secret codes?
- I'll never forget our last picnic.

10:43.667 --> 10:48.667
I warned Ike to wait an hour after eating
before going into the lake,

10:48.750 --> 10:51.667
- but he only waited 45 minutes.
- Did he get cramps?

10:51.750 --> 10:55.250
That's what's supposed to happen
if you don't wait an hour before you swim.

10:55.333 --> 11:00.042
Cramps are one reason,
but in Lake Lachrymose, there's another.

11:03.625 --> 11:07.375
Part of the lake is a breeding ground
Ñúëçëèâîòîîòî Lachrymose Leeches,

11:07.458 --> 11:10.958
which are quite different
from regular leeches.

11:11.042 --> 11:14.000
They each have six rows
of very sharp teeth

11:14.083 --> 11:16.083
and one very sharp nose

11:16.167 --> 11:21.042
that can smell the tiniest bit of food
from far, far away.

11:21.125 --> 11:24.083
The Lachrymose Leeches
are usually quite harmless,

11:24.167 --> 11:27.375
but if they smell food on a human,

11:27.458 --> 11:31.833
they will start to swarm around him and...

11:43.333 --> 11:44.625
I apologize, children.

11:45.708 --> 11:49.792
It is grammatically incorrect
to end a sentence with the word "and,"

11:49.875 --> 11:52.375
but I get so upset when I think about Ike.

11:52.458 --> 11:55.458
- We're sorry we asked about him.
- We didn't mean to upset you.

11:55.542 --> 11:58.625
Aunt Josephine,
you said you had answers for us.

11:59.208 --> 12:02.083
Yes! Thank you for reminding me.

12:03.708 --> 12:06.667
As soon as Sunny said,

12:06.750 --> 12:09.750
I knew you were missing
some crucial information.

12:10.250 --> 12:11.833
Sunny? What did she say?

12:11.917 --> 12:15.167
Don't you remember, Klaus?
She said "Delmo,"

12:15.250 --> 12:17.542
and that's when I knew
what I had to impart.

12:17.625 --> 12:23.417
The key to making sense to this...
this confusing and terrifying world.

12:24.750 --> 12:26.083
Perhaps you're too young.

12:26.167 --> 12:27.833
- We can handle it.
- We can handle anything.

12:36.292 --> 12:37.125
Grammar.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.250
- Grammar?
- Grammar.

12:39.333 --> 12:44.083
Since I lost Ike,
I have devoted my life to the study of it.

12:44.167 --> 12:47.125
Here is a complete history of nouns.

12:47.208 --> 12:52.333
Oh! And there is an explicitly illustrated
encyclopedia of verbs.

12:52.417 --> 12:54.417
I am so happy to have

12:54.500 --> 12:57.792
three young new charges
to learn everything,

12:58.375 --> 13:01.875
from the Oxford comma
to the Wesleyan semicolon.

13:01.958 --> 13:03.708
- Grammar.
- Grammar!

13:03.792 --> 13:06.375
It's the greatest joy in life,
don't you find?

13:06.458 --> 13:10.000
Aunt Josephine, what does grammar
have to do with developing secret codes?

13:10.083 --> 13:14.625
Uh, you used the wrong tense, Klaus.
It's a common grammatical error.

13:14.708 --> 13:16.083
You should have said,

13:16.167 --> 13:19.750
"What did grammar have to do
with developing secret codes?"

13:19.833 --> 13:22.958
- What did grammar have to do...
- Absolutely nothing.

13:23.042 --> 13:25.417
It's the clock.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.208
Lunch time.

13:27.917 --> 13:29.250
How does soup sound?

13:29.333 --> 13:31.417
Soup sounds wonderful.

13:39.167 --> 13:42.667
- Uh, cold soup.
- Oh, yes. I never cook anything hot.

13:42.750 --> 13:45.500
I'm afraid to turn on the stove.
It... it might burst into flames.

13:47.125 --> 13:51.458
This is chilled cucumber soup.
It's a recipe that I learned in Egypt,

13:51.542 --> 13:54.375
where I was briefly employed
as a snake charmer.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.000
Our father lived in Egypt
before we were born.

13:57.083 --> 13:59.083
- Is that when you...
- I don't talk about that.

13:59.167 --> 14:02.208
- When we were living with Uncle Monty...
- I said I don't talk about that.

14:02.292 --> 14:05.917
- But there was a statue...
- Klaus, I said I don't talk about that.

14:06.417 --> 14:08.708
You don't talk about that?
Or you won't?

14:11.875 --> 14:14.167
This is one of those
rare grammatical instances

14:14.250 --> 14:17.208
where "don't" and "won't"
mean the same thing.

14:17.292 --> 14:21.083
I knew your parents a long time ago,
when things were very different.

14:21.708 --> 14:23.875
Those were fierce and formidable days.

14:24.542 --> 14:28.250
But I don't talk about that,
and you won't hear about that.

14:28.333 --> 14:29.917
I shouldn't have to tell you orphans

14:30.000 --> 14:33.167
there are many, many things
to be afraid of in this world.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.917
The safest strategy
is to be afraid of them all.

14:36.399 --> 14:38.318
Get her help.

14:39.042 --> 14:41.500
I like to think of happier things.

14:41.583 --> 14:45.917
The joys of grammar
and how much Ike loved the sunshine.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.792
I like to imagine that where he is now,

14:47.875 --> 14:51.375
the weather is just as lovely
and sunny as can be.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.750
Of course, nobody knows
what happens to you when you die,

14:53.833 --> 14:56.458
but I like to think
that my husband is somewhere hot.

14:56.542 --> 15:00.458
Aunt Josephine, have you ever thought
about moving somewhere else?

15:01.042 --> 15:03.125
Maybe if you lived far away
from Lake Lachrymose,

15:03.208 --> 15:05.417
- you might feel better.
- We'd go with you.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.292
Maybe then you'd feel comfortable enough

15:08.375 --> 15:12.458
to discuss some of the things
you don't and won't discuss.

15:12.542 --> 15:14.583
I could never sell this house.

15:15.292 --> 15:17.042
I'm afraid of real estate agents.

15:22.208 --> 15:24.417
I'm sure you know
there are two kinds of fears:

15:24.500 --> 15:26.208
rational and irrational.

15:26.292 --> 15:27.458
Or, in simpler terms,

15:27.542 --> 15:29.667
fears that make sense
and fears that don't.

15:29.750 --> 15:33.583
For instance, the Baudelaire orphans
had a fear of Count Olaf,

15:33.667 --> 15:36.250
which makes perfect sense
because he is an evil man

15:36.333 --> 15:37.583
who wants to destroy them.

15:37.667 --> 15:40.250
But if they were afraid
of lemon meringue pie,

15:40.333 --> 15:43.958
that would be an irrational fear
because lemon meringue pie is delicious

15:44.042 --> 15:45.667
and has never hurt a soul.

15:45.750 --> 15:49.292
Being afraid of hurricanes
is perfectly rational

15:49.375 --> 15:51.958
because they can be quite sinister
and destructive.

15:52.042 --> 15:55.375
But a fear of real estate agents,
a term which here means

15:55.458 --> 15:58.375
"people who assist in the buying
and selling of houses,"

15:58.458 --> 16:00.083
would be an irrational fear

16:00.167 --> 16:04.292
because nothing sinister has ever come
from the real estate market.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.792
Count Olaf.
I didn't think I'd see you again

16:37.875 --> 16:40.125
after all that unpleasantness
with Mr. Snicket.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.875
What are you doing here?
It's the off-season.

16:42.958 --> 16:46.875
Thanks to a helpful real estate agent,
this restaurant is under new management.

16:46.958 --> 16:49.292
New management?
Don't make me laugh.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.750
You're not laughing.

16:50.833 --> 16:52.292
Neither are you.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.042
The Baudelaires are safe and sound
and learning everything they need to know

16:56.125 --> 16:57.458
- about our secret organization.
- Oh?

16:57.542 --> 17:00.208
They should've begun their training
years ago, but it's not too late.

17:00.292 --> 17:01.375
Rats!

17:01.458 --> 17:05.750
Their new guardian is the most fierce
and formidable member of our organization.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.000
Wait, not Snicket?

17:07.083 --> 17:09.291
What? No. Isn't he dead?

17:09.375 --> 17:10.708
Is he?

17:11.958 --> 17:12.958
It doesn't matter.

17:13.041 --> 17:17.166
All your silly codes
and obscure literary references

17:17.250 --> 17:18.500
- can't save you.
- Oh?

17:18.583 --> 17:20.583
The Baudelaire children will be destroyed,

17:20.666 --> 17:22.666
- and their fortune will be mine.
- Rats!

17:22.750 --> 17:26.333
You and your ridiculous comrades
will be swept away.

17:29.125 --> 17:31.542
- We'll see about that.
- Yes, we will.

17:31.625 --> 17:34.375
That's what I'm saying.
You can push me around all you want...

17:34.458 --> 17:36.333
- Thank you.
- But Josephine will stop you.

17:36.417 --> 17:37.417
The children will stop you.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.792
Reports indicate
that they have incredible gifts.

17:40.833 --> 17:42.250
Josephine?

17:56.125 --> 17:57.458
Gifts!

17:58.625 --> 18:01.042
For Violet, a lovely doll...

18:02.375 --> 18:04.083
with plenty of outfits.

18:05.333 --> 18:08.000
Her name is Pretty Penny.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.083
- Isn't she adorable?
- She looks a little like Madame Curie.

18:12.333 --> 18:15.000
For Klaus, a deck of cards.

18:15.667 --> 18:19.750
I have never been a young boy,
but I hear they enjoy card games.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.667
I once read a book about the history
of legalized gambling.

18:23.667 --> 18:27.458
And for little Sunny, it is a rattle.

18:27.542 --> 18:29.958
It makes a little noise.

18:29.990 --> 18:31.990
I prefer the music of Tito Puente.

18:32.875 --> 18:33.792
Do you like them?

18:33.875 --> 18:36.125
It's very generous of you, Aunt Josephine.

18:36.208 --> 18:39.292
Well, I know
my home isn't the warmest place,

18:39.375 --> 18:42.375
but if you follow the rules,
it will be a safe one.

18:42.458 --> 18:47.792
And as your guardian,
your safety is my greatest responsibility.

18:47.875 --> 18:52.292
That is why I put cans
near all the doors and windows each night.

18:52.375 --> 18:55.583
In case any burglars come in,
they trip over the cans and wake us up.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.083
But what if we're awake in the house
with an angry burglar?

18:58.167 --> 18:59.708
Angry burglar? Where?

18:59.792 --> 19:02.375
Aunt Josephine, you must be very worried
about Hurricane Herman.

19:02.458 --> 19:03.625
- Hurricane?
- Herman.

19:03.708 --> 19:06.292
The taxi driver said
it's a huge storm headed our way.

19:06.375 --> 19:07.583
Oh, dear.

19:07.667 --> 19:10.458
We'll need food! We'll need supplies!

19:10.542 --> 19:12.750
We must all go to town immediately.

19:12.833 --> 19:15.208
Maybe my sisters and I could stay here.

19:15.292 --> 19:19.292
Good point. You never know
what might happen in a small town.

19:19.375 --> 19:23.417
You ever read Thornton Wilder?
Perhaps we should all stay here.

19:23.500 --> 19:27.208
Of course, but what if we run out of food
in the middle of a hurricane?

19:27.292 --> 19:30.250
- Wouldn't that be frightening?
- Terrifyingly frightening?

19:34.958 --> 19:37.250
I won't be long, children!

19:37.792 --> 19:42.625
Don't do anything dangerous!
You know, anything I wouldn't do!

19:42.708 --> 19:45.333
- Of course not!
- Nothing you wouldn't do!

19:56.000 --> 19:57.167
I know you don't care for the sound,

19:57.250 --> 19:59.458
but maybe I could use your rattle
to invent a burglar alarm

19:59.542 --> 20:02.208
so Aunt Josephine
won't have to rely on piles of cans.

20:02.292 --> 20:04.208
And, Sunny,
you can have the deck of cards.

20:04.792 --> 20:06.542
You enjoy playing poker more than I do.

20:06.625 --> 20:10.333
- That leaves you with the doll.
- Plenty of boys enjoy playing with dolls.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.292
Although, I would rather a book.

20:12.375 --> 20:15.458
- That doesn't seem fair.
- At least Aunt Josephine's trying.

20:15.542 --> 20:18.583
She wanted to get us gifts,
even though she didn't know what we liked.

20:18.667 --> 20:20.083
We shouldn't complain.

20:20.167 --> 20:21.917
You're right. She means well.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.625
Even though she's terrified of everything,
we shouldn't complain.

20:24.708 --> 20:26.125
You're right.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.833
- I want to complain anyway.
- Let's get to work.

20:41.750 --> 20:43.750
Aunt Josephine told us
that all the answers we need

20:43.833 --> 20:46.292
were in her library,
but she made a grammatical error.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.208
Wait, let me get this straight.
Aunt Josephine made a grammatical error?

20:49.958 --> 20:52.583
The word "library" is singular,
meaning one.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.042
But this isn't one library, it's two.

20:55.125 --> 20:56.750
The one you see here...

21:00.167 --> 21:01.292
and the one you don't.

21:01.375 --> 21:04.500
Aunt Josephine might not open up,
but her safe might.

21:04.583 --> 21:07.042
That won't be easy.
That's why people have safes.

21:07.125 --> 21:08.958
Most safes use three numbers.

21:09.042 --> 21:11.375
That means that there are thousands
of possible combinations.

21:11.458 --> 21:12.292
One million.

21:12.375 --> 21:14.917
Aunt Josephine said that she
and our parents developed secret codes.

21:15.833 --> 21:19.292
In some codes,
numbers substitute for letters and words.

21:19.375 --> 21:22.333
It'd have to be something she'd remember.
Something she cares about.

21:22.417 --> 21:24.292
- "Grammar"?
- Too many letters.

21:24.375 --> 21:27.125
What else does she care about?
Cold food?

21:27.208 --> 21:28.208
Doorbell safety?

21:28.292 --> 21:30.375
Avoiding questions
about anything we want to know?

21:30.732 --> 21:31.934
Ike!

21:31.958 --> 21:33.458
That's three letters long.

21:35.958 --> 21:39.292
"I" is the ninth letter of the alphabet.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.625
Eleven for "K."

21:42.125 --> 21:44.500
And "E," the fifth.

21:53.292 --> 21:54.333
Crackers?

21:54.957 --> 21:56.957
Safe crackers.

22:00.208 --> 22:01.958
Very high-pitched Beethoven.

22:02.042 --> 22:05.208
That's Ike's whistling music. And look...

22:07.417 --> 22:09.708
Aunt Josephine wrestling
with an alligator?

22:09.792 --> 22:10.917
And winning.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.708
Boxing. Skydiving.

22:14.292 --> 22:16.417
Who jumps out of a plane for fun?

22:16.500 --> 22:18.042
Cooking with fire.

22:18.125 --> 22:21.917
- She wasn't scared of anything.
- What happened to her?

22:26.458 --> 22:28.792
<i>The Incomplete History</i>
<i>of Secret Organizations.</i>

22:28.875 --> 22:30.208
All the answers are in here.

22:30.292 --> 22:32.292
Even if our guardian
won't tell us anything,

22:32.375 --> 22:34.417
we can still find out
what we're looking for.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.917
Not the doorknob!
Not the doorknob!

22:51.917 --> 22:53.083
Baudelaires.

22:53.583 --> 22:55.958
Baudelaires, there you are.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.292
Sunny!

22:57.375 --> 23:01.500
I found something very interesting
at the town market and petting zoo.

23:01.750 --> 23:02.583
Limes.

23:03.167 --> 23:07.375
I found two very interesting things
at the town market and petting zoo.

23:07.458 --> 23:10.750
One, yes, a great deal of limes
at a reasonable price.

23:10.833 --> 23:12.917
It's perfect for cold lime stew.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.875
The other is even better.

23:18.292 --> 23:20.250
Something wonderful.

23:21.417 --> 23:27.500
Baudelaires, I know I am a disappointment
to you and to countless others.

23:27.583 --> 23:30.917
Believe it or not, I used to be
a fierce and formidable woman.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.958
Your parents and I were more than friends.
We were associates.

23:36.042 --> 23:42.500
We were colleagues, comrades,
collaborators, allies, volunteers!

23:42.583 --> 23:45.042
But these are troubling times.

23:45.125 --> 23:46.875
I know you miss Ike very much.

23:46.958 --> 23:49.583
And I know you miss
your parents very much.

23:49.667 --> 23:52.833
It's a curious thing,
the death of a loved one.

23:52.917 --> 23:56.417
It's like climbing the stairs
to your room in the dark,

23:56.500 --> 24:00.250
thinking that there's one more stair
than there is.

24:00.333 --> 24:03.250
And your foot falls through the air,

24:03.750 --> 24:07.250
and there is a sickly feeling
of dark surprise.

24:07.333 --> 24:10.500
- That's exactly what it's like.
- It's terrifying.

24:10.583 --> 24:14.500
But today I realized,
with my hands full of limes,

24:14.583 --> 24:17.167
you can't be terrified forever.

24:17.250 --> 24:20.875
I think I am ready to be fierce
and formidable again.

24:20.958 --> 24:25.000
- And I think we can do it together.
- That sounds wonderful.

24:25.500 --> 24:29.042
So, can I leave you children alone
a few more hours?

24:29.125 --> 24:32.083
He wants to take me out
for a fried-egg sandwich.

24:32.708 --> 24:34.292
- What?
- I met a man,

24:34.375 --> 24:37.833
a gentleman,
at the town market and petting zoo.

24:37.917 --> 24:40.250
He has had a troubled past,

24:40.333 --> 24:43.292
and we're going to talk about it
over a fried-egg sandwich.

24:43.375 --> 24:45.750
It'll be good to have something hot
for a change.

24:45.833 --> 24:51.042
I just wanted to get a warm cardigan
that's flattering to my figure.

24:51.125 --> 24:52.958
You're going on a date?

24:53.042 --> 24:57.750
Don't be vulgar, Violet.
It is not a date, necessarily.

24:57.833 --> 25:02.417
It's just two adults sharing
quality time together

25:02.500 --> 25:06.250
over toasted rye bread and runny yolks.

25:06.333 --> 25:08.000
Oh, be nice to him, won't you?

25:08.083 --> 25:10.417
Just make small talk
while I get my sweater.

25:13.625 --> 25:15.250
Oh, Captain!

25:15.333 --> 25:17.167
Oh, Captain!

25:17.250 --> 25:20.542
I'm hobbling as fast as I can, Josephine.

25:24.542 --> 25:28.000
Well, good evening, children.

25:28.083 --> 25:31.750
My name is Captain Sham,
and my home is the sea.

25:32.958 --> 25:34.125
No, it isn't.

25:34.208 --> 25:36.083
Well, it's... it's a large lake.

25:36.167 --> 25:37.625
Don't be ridiculous.

25:37.708 --> 25:40.500
All right, all right.
My home is near a large lake.

25:40.583 --> 25:42.458
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

25:42.542 --> 25:45.125
We've already made your acquaintance.
You're Count Olaf.

25:45.208 --> 25:47.000
Count Olaf?

25:47.083 --> 25:49.375
Why would you bring up
such a terrifying person?

25:49.458 --> 25:51.042
Count Olaf!

25:51.125 --> 25:55.083
Just as I was working up the courage
to go put on my cardigan.

25:55.167 --> 25:57.917
Good thing we have a sea captain
to keep us safe.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.750
Aunt Josephine, this is not a sea captain.
This is Count Olaf.

26:00.833 --> 26:02.292
Klaus, I am shocked!

26:02.375 --> 26:03.375
It's true.

26:03.458 --> 26:07.375
I am shocked at your grammar.
You can't say, "This is Count Olaf."

26:07.458 --> 26:10.167
The proper sentence is,
"He is Count Olaf."

26:10.250 --> 26:12.417
Who is this Count Omar?
He sounds handsome.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.542
He has the same shiny eyes
and the same single eyebrow.

26:15.625 --> 26:17.375
Klaus! Grammar!

26:17.458 --> 26:19.708
- That is an eyepatch.
- The tattoo!

26:19.792 --> 26:22.375
Count Olaf has a tattoo of an eye
on his left ankle.

26:22.458 --> 26:23.625
Violet...

26:23.708 --> 26:29.458
this man's left ankle was devoured during
his duties as a sailboat rental agent.

26:29.542 --> 26:31.583
That's how the two of us met.

26:31.667 --> 26:33.292
- I was shopping for limes.
- She was shopping for limes.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.292
- Shall I?
- Oh, you tell it.

26:36.375 --> 26:37.542
- No, you tell it.
- Very well.

26:38.125 --> 26:40.042
I remember it as if it were yesterday.

26:40.125 --> 26:42.333
Although it was only a few hours ago.

26:43.081 --> 26:45.081
<i>A few hours ago...</i>

26:48.208 --> 26:51.250
Very fresh dill. Very fresh dill.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.125
Have you heard
that Captain Sham is in town?

26:53.208 --> 26:55.375
What a wonderful and handsome fellow
that Captain Sham is.

26:55.458 --> 26:57.833
Fish heads! Fish heads!
Roly-poly fish heads!

26:57.917 --> 27:00.083
- Speaking of handsome...
- Have you heard about Captain Sham?

27:00.167 --> 27:02.125
I'm talking to myself about Captain Sham.

27:02.208 --> 27:04.208
- Limes. A whole lot of limes.
- Limes!

27:04.292 --> 27:05.583
- Limes.
- I need some limes.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.875
- I sell limes.
- Oh, citric acid.

27:07.958 --> 27:09.542
Would you allow me, madam?

27:10.458 --> 27:13.417
I have an eye for ripeness,

27:13.500 --> 27:15.917
and I've always thought
that the tangiest pulp

27:16.000 --> 27:17.500
comes from the toughest rinds.

27:17.583 --> 27:18.917
Oh, my.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.125
Of course, you're probably
far too young to understand that, Miss...

27:22.208 --> 27:24.792
Anwhistle. Josephine Anwhistle.

27:24.875 --> 27:26.375
I'm Captain Sham.

27:26.458 --> 27:28.542
- The brave Captain Sham?
- The famous Captain Sham?

27:28.625 --> 27:30.292
- The Captain Sham.
- Who isn't in disguise?

27:30.375 --> 27:33.583
- Oh, I've heard your name everywhere.
- Yes, that's the idea.

27:33.667 --> 27:37.333
My name is Captain Sham,
and my home is the sea.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.917
Oh, I would have thought you lived nearby.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.792
Large lake, large lake.

27:42.875 --> 27:46.917
I am so happy to make the acquaintance
of a local personage.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.208
I've been so lonely since I lost my...

27:51.708 --> 27:52.833
- Um...
- Left.

27:52.917 --> 27:54.208
Left leg.

27:54.792 --> 27:55.833
I'm so sorry.

27:55.917 --> 27:58.833
Yeah, I've been fitted
with a wooden prosthetic.

28:00.208 --> 28:02.958
- How did it happen?
- Um, we used half of an old broom.

28:03.042 --> 28:05.292
- No, I mean, the accident.
- Oh, the accident!

28:05.875 --> 28:07.583
Nobody could possibly understand.

28:07.667 --> 28:08.917
It's un-understandable.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.375
- I was sitting on my boat...
- The way sailors do.

28:11.458 --> 28:14.625
- enjoying some pasta puttanesca...
- Which is also totally normal.

28:14.708 --> 28:18.417
- when I spilled some on my leg.
- And a very handsome leg it was.

28:18.500 --> 28:21.000
Before I knew it,
the leeches were attacking me.

28:21.083 --> 28:22.750
<i>- Terrible!</i>
- Ghastly!

28:22.833 --> 28:24.167
I fought them off as best I could.

28:24.250 --> 28:25.667
- Ka-pow!
- Zoink!

28:25.750 --> 28:28.750
- But my right leg was not strong enough.
- Left.

28:28.833 --> 28:32.250
My right leg was not strong enough
to rescue my left leg.

28:32.333 --> 28:35.083
- That's terrible.
- Yes, it is terrible.

28:35.167 --> 28:36.500
And no one can understand.

28:36.583 --> 28:37.917
- Can you, stranger?
- No.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.125
- You, other stranger?
- No.

28:40.208 --> 28:43.458
- I wish I could understand.
- Because you're so very handsome.

28:43.542 --> 28:48.375
You see, nobody can understand,
and that's why I'm all alone.

28:48.958 --> 28:50.583
Aw!

28:50.667 --> 28:52.625
I can understand, Captain Sham.

28:52.708 --> 28:53.958
- What?
- It can't be!

28:54.042 --> 28:54.958
- Extra...
- ordinary.

28:55.042 --> 28:56.250
I don't believe it.

28:56.333 --> 28:58.833
That's just how it happened
with my husband.

28:58.917 --> 29:00.792
- That wasn't pasta.
- Leeches.

29:00.875 --> 29:03.125
I lost my husband
to the Lachrymose Leeches.

29:03.208 --> 29:06.583
Good heavens!
I had absolutely no idea. I swear.

29:06.667 --> 29:07.667
None of us did.

29:07.750 --> 29:09.042
I've never even heard of your husband Ike.

29:09.833 --> 29:11.958
Then... you do understand.

29:12.042 --> 29:13.708
- I think I do.
- What?

29:13.792 --> 29:14.833
- Two lost...
- and damaged souls.

29:14.917 --> 29:16.958
K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

29:17.042 --> 29:20.542
Could it be possible
that my lonely days are over?

29:20.625 --> 29:24.542
I have been lonely, too.
And I disconnected the doorbell.

29:24.625 --> 29:27.167
- Why did you do that?
- Because of electrocution.

29:27.250 --> 29:28.750
- That's crazy.
- Uh, boss!

29:28.833 --> 29:32.417
Crazy because
I did the exact same thing myself!

29:32.500 --> 29:34.292
- Really?
- Okay, yes.

29:34.375 --> 29:36.000
The world is so terrifying.

29:36.083 --> 29:40.417
It is? It is!
Just like the rough and tumultuous sea.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.292
- Lake.
- Lake.

29:42.375 --> 29:44.958
Well, perhaps I need a captain.

29:45.042 --> 29:46.458
Yes. Yes!

29:46.542 --> 29:50.667
Perhaps we should sail this fragile
and flammable world together.

29:50.750 --> 29:54.167
- Sail?
- Yes, I'm a sailboat rental agent.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.708
Is that anything
like a real estate agent?

29:57.292 --> 29:58.583
It's actually quite similar.

29:58.667 --> 30:01.250
Absolutely not.
See? I have my own business card.

30:02.917 --> 30:07.208
"Captain Sham's Sailboats.
Every boat has it's own sail."

30:07.833 --> 30:11.833
Oh, Captain, you have made
a serious grammatical error here.

30:11.917 --> 30:12.750
What?

30:12.833 --> 30:16.708
This card says "it's," I-T-apostrophe-S.

30:16.792 --> 30:18.792
That always means "it is."

30:18.875 --> 30:22.458
You don't mean to say
"Every boat has it is own sail."

30:22.542 --> 30:26.708
You mean simply I-T-S,
as in "belonging to it."

30:26.792 --> 30:29.625
It's a common mistake, but a dreadful one.

30:29.708 --> 30:32.875
Thank you for pointing that out.

30:32.958 --> 30:37.000
Care to accompany me on a cruise
through leech-infested waters?

30:37.625 --> 30:41.917
Oh, no, Captain. I couldn't possibly
go out on Lake Lachrymose.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.958
Not after what happened to my husband.

30:44.042 --> 30:45.667
I'm surprised you can.

30:45.750 --> 30:48.125
I can't! I never said I could. Uh...

30:48.208 --> 30:49.542
Fried-egg sandwich.

30:49.625 --> 30:52.958
How would you like to go get
a fried-egg sandwich?

30:53.042 --> 30:54.000
What an opportunity.

30:54.083 --> 30:55.375
- I'm so...
- jealous.

30:55.458 --> 30:58.500
- I'd love to.
- Great.

31:03.750 --> 31:08.458
Perhaps I could review it one more time.
I-T-apostrophe-S.

31:08.542 --> 31:10.750
I'm sure they understand, Josephine!

31:10.833 --> 31:14.833
After all, these three children
aren't blithering morons,

31:14.917 --> 31:16.667
are you, Baudelaires?

31:16.750 --> 31:21.917
No, they're wonderful,
obedient little orphans.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.792
Maybe one day, they'll also let me
take them on a boat ride, very far away.

31:28.278 --> 31:28.768
Go jump in the lake.

31:29.292 --> 31:31.875
Ahoy, a hairless pygmy!

31:31.958 --> 31:34.000
She is a baby and you know that.

31:34.083 --> 31:36.667
We'll discuss
what sort of pygmy she is later.

31:36.750 --> 31:40.125
In the meantime, the adults have a date.

31:40.208 --> 31:41.375
- I'll get my cardigan.
- Hmm.

31:41.458 --> 31:42.750
Aunt Josephine!

31:42.833 --> 31:46.292
Oh, Violet, calm down.
I'll be back in a jiffy!

31:47.458 --> 31:48.458
So...

31:50.875 --> 31:52.500
long time, no see.

31:52.583 --> 31:55.208
- You'll never get away with this.
- Get away with what?

31:55.292 --> 31:58.958
I'm just a sea captain
romancing a fierce and formidable woman.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.208
- You're not a sea captain.
- Oh, yes, I am.

32:01.292 --> 32:02.792
It says so on my business cards.

32:02.875 --> 32:05.458
Business cards aren't proof of anything.
Anyone can go to a print shop

32:05.542 --> 32:07.042
and have cards made
that say anything they like.

32:07.125 --> 32:12.542
Well, you're just a heap of facts,
aren't you, Klaus?

32:12.625 --> 32:17.500
Facts and facts and facts and facts!

32:18.083 --> 32:20.750
But none of them do you any good.

32:20.833 --> 32:23.750
Just like poor Uncle Monty.

32:23.833 --> 32:27.625
And your parents, may they rest in ashes.

32:27.708 --> 32:29.375
Oh, Captain Sham?

32:29.458 --> 32:30.833
Aunt Josephine,
we have to tell you something.

32:30.917 --> 32:34.083
That's right!
Stay back, Josephine! Stay back!

32:34.167 --> 32:35.625
There's lit candles in here!

32:35.708 --> 32:37.375
Everyone remain calm.

32:37.458 --> 32:39.250
Remain calm!

32:44.125 --> 32:45.958
Oh, the heat!

32:46.042 --> 32:47.083
The heat!

32:55.083 --> 32:57.667
The danger has passed. It's fine now.

32:57.750 --> 33:01.250
The orphans tried to engulf your entire
house in flames, but it's fine now.

33:02.583 --> 33:04.708
Oh, thank you, Captain Sham.

33:04.792 --> 33:05.917
Please...

33:06.958 --> 33:09.375
call me... Julio.

33:09.958 --> 33:11.208
Julio.

33:11.292 --> 33:16.833
- Now, let's get a fried egg in you, madam.
- I would like that very much.

33:16.917 --> 33:18.917
Though the orphans would like
to say they're sorry,

33:19.000 --> 33:20.083
wouldn't you, orphans?

33:20.167 --> 33:21.667
We're very sorry.

33:21.750 --> 33:24.167
We'll speak no more about it, Baudelaires.

33:24.250 --> 33:27.875
Clean up the dishes and go to bed.
And no more candles.

33:27.958 --> 33:30.458
- Yes, Aunt Josephine.
- Or doorknobs!

33:30.542 --> 33:31.833
- Of course.
- Or...

33:31.917 --> 33:33.250
Come now, Josephine.

33:33.333 --> 33:36.875
Our romantic ride
in the back of a taxi awaits.

33:38.042 --> 33:40.500
And be careful in your dreams.

33:40.583 --> 33:43.792
Don't wait up, orphans.

33:46.083 --> 33:49.208
We have to go after her.

33:50.667 --> 33:52.833
There are at least
half a dozen egg sandwich restaurants

33:52.917 --> 33:54.333
within driving distance.

33:55.052 --> 33:55.876
Uber?

33:56.500 --> 33:57.500
We'll walk into town.

33:57.583 --> 33:59.875
If we see the taxi driver,
we can ask him where he took them.

33:59.958 --> 34:01.333
What do we do when we find them?

34:01.417 --> 34:04.292
Aunt Josephine's fallen for
Count Olaf's disguise and for Count Olaf.

34:04.375 --> 34:07.042
Maybe so, but we haven't.

34:07.958 --> 34:10.375
Whatever Count Olaf's scheme is,
we have to stop it.

34:25.667 --> 34:26.833
Going somewhere?

34:27.417 --> 34:30.000
Young people shouldn't wander around
this time of night.

34:30.083 --> 34:31.458
There are dangerous people lurking about.

34:31.542 --> 34:33.167
- Go back in the house.
- Where it's safer.

34:33.250 --> 34:35.125
And strangers can't get you.

34:35.208 --> 34:36.750
Strangers? Where?

34:36.833 --> 34:38.917
I thought
you were guarding the waiter.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.458
I thought they were.

34:40.542 --> 34:43.500
- We thought he was!
- So, nobody's guarding the waiter?

34:57.625 --> 34:59.458
We'll be keeping an eye on you.

35:05.792 --> 35:07.125
Must be another way out of here.

35:07.208 --> 35:09.708
There is one other way. Wait here.

35:12.083 --> 35:13.417
We can't get out that way.

35:14.042 --> 35:17.042
Even if that window could open,
it's at least a 100-foot drop.

35:17.125 --> 35:19.292
Or a 100-foot climb.

35:19.375 --> 35:22.292
I saw some fishing nets in the kitchen.
I could braid them into a ladder.

35:22.375 --> 35:24.208
- Violet...
- We could break the window and climb down.

35:24.292 --> 35:25.458
- Violet...
- We'd reach the water...

35:25.542 --> 35:26.542
- Violet...
- in no time.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.667
- Then what?
- I don't know. I don't know what to do.

35:29.750 --> 35:31.333
We don't even know
what Count Olaf's plan is.

35:31.417 --> 35:33.833
We know he wants to use
Aunt Josephine to get our fortune.

35:33.917 --> 35:37.375
Then maybe he's going to kill her,
like he did Uncle Monty.

35:37.458 --> 35:39.667
Maybe he's gonna marry her,
like he tried to do with me.

35:39.750 --> 35:42.833
I can think of 100 different outcomes,
all of which are terrifying.

35:42.917 --> 35:45.917
- That must be how Aunt Josephine feels.
- Maybe she's right.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.667
The world is scary
and we should be afraid.

35:48.750 --> 35:50.708
No matter where we go,
Count Olaf will be there.

35:51.292 --> 35:54.417
No matter who we tell,
no one will listen to us.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.458
There is nowhere safe for us...

35:57.875 --> 35:59.625
and no guardian can help us.

36:04.417 --> 36:06.000
And our parents are never coming back.

36:06.083 --> 36:08.375
"Life is a conundrum of esoterica."

36:08.458 --> 36:11.292
- That's what Uncle Monty...
- Uncle Monty is dead.

36:11.375 --> 36:12.708
Aunt Josephine isn't.

36:12.792 --> 36:15.917
She didn't protect us from Count Olaf,
but we can still protect her.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.958
We have to warn her,
even if it's dangerous.

36:18.583 --> 36:19.917
You don't sound scared.

36:20.500 --> 36:24.042
Remember what Mother said?
"Do the scary thing first... "

36:24.125 --> 36:25.500
"And get scared afterwards."

36:27.583 --> 36:30.042
I'll see what I can find.

36:33.083 --> 36:35.083
I'll work on that ladder.

36:35.167 --> 36:38.000
<i># I, I, I #</i>

36:39.208 --> 36:42.167
<i># I love the sea #</i>

36:42.250 --> 36:46.083
<i># The reason I'm a sailor 'cause #</i>

36:46.167 --> 36:49.250
<i># It's the only way to be #</i>

36:49.333 --> 36:53.167
<i># Well, I love schooners
And I love ships #</i>

36:53.250 --> 36:56.750
<i># And I love that boat that tugs #</i>

36:56.833 --> 37:00.458
<i># I have nautical images #</i>

37:00.542 --> 37:03.083
<i># On all my sheets and rugs #</i>

37:03.167 --> 37:04.208
See what I did?

37:04.292 --> 37:07.583
<i># I, I, I #</i>

37:07.667 --> 37:10.958
<i># I love the sea #</i>

37:11.042 --> 37:14.500
<i># The reason I'm a sailor 'cause #</i>

37:14.583 --> 37:18.208
<i># It's the only way to be #</i>

37:18.292 --> 37:21.917
<i># The reason I'm a sailor 'cause #</i>

37:22.000 --> 37:28.125
<i># It's the only way to be #</i>

37:30.083 --> 37:32.000
It's a large lake, actually.

37:33.208 --> 37:35.500
I do hope the children will be safe.

37:37.125 --> 37:39.417
I do hope
the children will be safe.

37:42.333 --> 37:43.583
We should have a clear flight,

37:43.667 --> 37:45.542
provided the weather holds,
the plane flies,

37:45.625 --> 37:47.458
and none of our enemies have air cannons.

37:47.542 --> 37:50.125
- That sounds like...
- Our honeymoon.

37:51.625 --> 37:53.750
- Things worked out then.
- Well, things change.

37:53.833 --> 37:56.083
We have three children who need us,
and they need us now.

37:56.167 --> 37:59.958
- They're brave, like their mother.
- They're bold, like their father.

38:01.125 --> 38:02.792
Have you decoded the message yet?

38:03.583 --> 38:08.667
It says, "You can't lock up the barn
after the horses are gone."

38:08.750 --> 38:10.333
I hope we're not too late.

38:13.667 --> 38:16.542
- Bullet holes.
- It <i>is</i> like our honeymoon.

38:17.458 --> 38:20.875
The expression "You can't lock up the barn
after the horses are gone"

38:20.958 --> 38:23.542
was a favorite of a woman
who meant a great deal to me,

38:23.625 --> 38:26.292
even after she was trampled.

38:26.375 --> 38:29.625
The expression simply means that
sometimes even the best of plans

38:29.708 --> 38:31.625
will occur to you when it is too late,

38:31.708 --> 38:34.708
just as all of us are far, far too late

38:34.792 --> 38:37.250
to be of any help at all
to the Baudelaires.

38:38.167 --> 38:41.500
<i>I wish that I could go back somehow
and warn the Baudelaires</i>

38:41.583 --> 38:44.042
<i>about what would happen
that sorry evening.</i>

38:44.667 --> 38:48.958
I spend many sleepless nights wishing
there was some powerful invention,

38:49.042 --> 38:51.083
some crucial bit of research,

38:51.167 --> 38:54.458
<i>that might enable me to change
the Baudelaires' sad history.</i>

38:54.542 --> 38:57.583
<i>But again and again I remind myself
that there was nothing I could do,</i>

38:57.667 --> 39:00.917
<i>just as the Baudelaires could do nothing
to prevent that window from shattering.</i>

39:01.000 --> 39:02.500
What was that?

39:02.583 --> 39:03.875
It sounded like a window shattering.

39:04.542 --> 39:07.542
- Aunt Josephine!
- Aunt Josephine?

39:09.792 --> 39:11.417
Aunt Josephine...

39:37.458 --> 39:39.583
"Violet, Klaus and Sunny:

39:40.792 --> 39:43.417
By the time you read this note,
my life will be at it's end."

39:43.500 --> 39:44.500
No.

39:44.583 --> 39:48.542
"My heart is as cold as Ike,
and I find my life inbearable."

39:48.625 --> 39:50.375
Aunt Josephine.

39:52.250 --> 39:55.000
It is impossible to go back, of course,

39:55.083 --> 39:58.625
and tell the Baudelaires that their fears
that night were entirely rational.

39:58.708 --> 40:01.708
It is impossible to go back
and tell them anything at all,

40:01.792 --> 40:04.417
just as it is impossible
to put Aunt Josephine's house

40:04.500 --> 40:06.167
back on top of this cliff.

40:08.417 --> 40:10.000
I can tell you something.

40:10.083 --> 40:12.667
I can tell you that,
as the Baudelaires stood there

40:12.750 --> 40:15.792
and gazed out the wide window
of Josephine's house,

40:15.875 --> 40:18.958
- believing that their guardian was dead...
- Aunt Josephine.

40:19.042 --> 40:20.375
that they were wrong.

40:21.500 --> 40:24.833
I can tell you that
Aunt Josephine was not dead at all.
