WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:02.803
What do you want from
me here? I'm trying

00:02.836 --> 00:04.372
to move on, and
you won't let me.

00:04.405 --> 00:06.240
This is so hard for me.
I am so confused.

00:06.274 --> 00:09.410
I have decided to run
against you for mayor.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.245
How badly do you want to beat
Ruby Jeffries for mayor?

00:11.279 --> 00:12.180
Let me run your campaign.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.514
You will be unbeatable.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.384
I was just wondering
if you could do casual

00:16.417 --> 00:19.387
my way, which means
being monogamous.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.388
Yeah, I think I can do that.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.769
(spitting)

00:35.803 --> 00:38.439
Oh, Lavon! Ugh!

00:53.321 --> 00:55.756
ZOE: Someone has been
 sleeping in my bed.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.691
My comforter was mushed.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.093
The pillows were indented.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.828
Whoa, indented?

01:00.861 --> 01:03.364
Well, there could be
some sort of phantom musher.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.767
Or maybe you're overtired
and a little out of it.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.569
What?

01:08.602 --> 01:10.304
Mm-hmm.
Ugh.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.772
You know, ever since
we became monogamous,

01:11.805 --> 01:14.175
Wade and I have been
sleeping less than ever.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.576
No details necessary.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.645
Fine, but I know
that I made my bed

01:17.678 --> 01:19.113
because my Kate Spade
sheets arrived

01:19.147 --> 01:20.781
and I wanted to see
how they looked.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.116
And now I've lost interest.

01:22.150 --> 01:22.783
That was fast.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.685
Lavon!

01:24.718 --> 01:26.320
Weird things have
been happening all week.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.722
I chalked it up to the remodel,
but then I found a sock

01:28.756 --> 01:29.723
in my underwear drawer, and...

01:29.757 --> 01:31.759
there was a mysterious
toothbrush in my bathroom.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.227
Whoa.
So, now it's clear.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.662
You have a stalker.
Yeah.

01:34.695 --> 01:35.663
Slash organizer.

01:35.696 --> 01:36.830
Slash dental hygienist.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.299
That...
Or...

01:38.332 --> 01:40.134
it's Halloween

01:40.168 --> 01:43.137
and Wade is just messing
with you because he can.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.405
(roars)
(screams)

01:45.839 --> 01:47.241
Pretty sexy, huh?
Oh, my God.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.309
Could you be any more immature?

01:48.342 --> 01:49.910
Ow.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.912
Hey, that was pretty sexy.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.781
Ugh, you know
what is even less sexy

01:53.814 --> 01:55.349
than that ridiculous costume?

01:55.383 --> 01:58.186
Your infantile pranks.
Huh?

01:58.219 --> 02:00.554
Apparently, someone slept
in big Z's bed last night.
Well, Doc,

02:00.588 --> 02:02.823
you know very well
I was tied up last night.

02:02.856 --> 02:03.824
Literally.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.659
Oh. Ew!

02:05.693 --> 02:06.827
Well, if it wasn't him,
then it was someone else.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.229
Could you please
call the sheriff?

02:08.262 --> 02:09.562
WADE:
I don't mean
to freak you guys out.

02:09.597 --> 02:12.866
Have you considered
the possibility of demons?

02:12.900 --> 02:14.602
Demons? This is why I
don't let you talk in bed.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.803
LAVON:
You know what?
I'm going to let

02:15.836 --> 02:17.871
you two figure this
out for yourselves.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.474
'Cause I have important campaign
business to attend to today.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.376
Like...

02:22.410 --> 02:23.711
handing out candy
in Town Square.

02:23.744 --> 02:24.812
Good-bye.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.750
He is not going to help me
catch my stalker.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.253
LEMON:
Please wear this.
Thank you so much.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.726
Ladies, up, up, up.

02:38.759 --> 02:39.860
It is a week
until the election

02:39.893 --> 02:42.530
and Lavon is neck and
waddley neck with Ruby Jeffries

02:42.563 --> 02:43.964
and you're all just
sitting here like lumps

02:43.997 --> 02:45.933
when you should be handing out
buttons and candy and cheer.

02:45.966 --> 02:49.169
Go, go, go, Lavon!

02:50.238 --> 02:51.872
You said cheer.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.741
Up, up!

02:53.774 --> 02:55.809
Who wouldn't vote
for Lavon Hayes?

02:55.843 --> 02:58.479
Just look at that
trustworthy face and those

02:58.512 --> 02:59.480
big, strong,

02:59.513 --> 03:00.814
sexy...
Hello, ladies.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.416
Lavon! Oh, you're here.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.485
(laughs)
Um, how are you?

03:04.518 --> 03:05.286
Can I get you anything?

03:05.319 --> 03:07.421
Sweet tea, lemonade, brownie?
Uh,

03:07.455 --> 03:08.822
I'm good.
How's it looking, ladies?

03:08.856 --> 03:09.823
It's looking great!
It's great!

03:09.857 --> 03:11.592
Super great.
You look amazing.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.294
Those new posters showcasing you

03:13.327 --> 03:14.728
in your Alabama football years
seem to be working.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.430
We just secured

03:16.464 --> 03:18.666
the PTA and Sanitation Workers'
endorsements.

03:18.699 --> 03:19.967
Jim and Mabeline Watkins.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.303
Lavon Hayes is back
in the fight.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.537
Yes, nice work.
Whoo!

03:23.571 --> 03:25.873
Ruby can't have the
paper call Lavon Hayes

03:25.906 --> 03:27.975
a "Thief in Chief"
and get away with it.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.310
I want to take her down, Lemon.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.678
I want it bad.
So do I.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.613
So, we're going to have
to start knocking

03:32.646 --> 03:34.282
on doors, because it
is a very tight race.

03:34.315 --> 03:35.483
Every single vote counts.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.817
Oh, yeah.
Lem...

03:36.850 --> 03:39.653
(panting):
Great...

03:39.687 --> 03:40.721
Tom. Breathe.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.457
(panting):
...news!

03:43.491 --> 03:45.726
I just registered 30 new voters.

03:45.759 --> 03:46.827
Yes!
Hey.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.263
(imitates gunfire,
blows sharply)

03:49.297 --> 03:51.265
Including the entire
Beaudry clan.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.467
(gasps) No!
Yeah. That's 22 people

03:53.501 --> 03:55.603
in that family. (grunts)
No.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.438
Yeah. Yes.
No.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.607
No!
No?
LEMON:
Tom!

03:59.640 --> 04:01.475
The Beaudrys
are Auburn fans.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.010
There is no way
they're going to vote

04:03.043 --> 04:04.978
for a former Tide
linebacker.

04:05.012 --> 04:08.716
You have to fix this.
Oh... no.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.619
I'm sorry, but I am not
killing the Beaudrys.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.826
Well, I'd offer
to help, but...

04:18.858 --> 04:20.327
But you know I'd deck you.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.728
GEORGE:
You know...

04:21.762 --> 04:23.931
you didn't have to walk me
all the way up here, Daisy.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.566
I didn't want you
to get lost.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.468
(chuckles)
Okay.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.902
Well, you know what?

04:28.936 --> 04:31.639
I guess a pretty escort
is always welcome.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.607
It was the least
I could do.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.676
Thanks so much for
dinner last night.

04:35.709 --> 04:36.810
Fancie's was...

04:36.844 --> 04:38.346
so fancy.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.514
No problem.
SAVANNAH:
George Tucker!

04:40.548 --> 04:41.715
I've been looking for you.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.584
So, I was wondering
if you had a date

04:43.617 --> 04:44.818
to the Halloween party tomorrow.

04:44.852 --> 04:45.853
But I was
just about

04:45.886 --> 04:47.020
to ask him.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.490
Uh, ladies.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.858
I'm sorry. I'm a little new

04:50.891 --> 04:52.860
at this whole
being single thing, and...

04:52.893 --> 04:54.828
See, I just don't want to
disappoint either of you, so...

04:54.862 --> 04:56.397
Oh, you sweet thing.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.399
We don't want
to overwhelm you.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.434
Not at all.
You go by yourself.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.336
We'll both dance
with you.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.074
WOMAN:
Seriously?

05:07.107 --> 05:08.976
They fell for that line?
What has happened

05:09.009 --> 05:11.078
to the education system
in BlueBell?

05:11.111 --> 05:12.179
Now, hold on just a second.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.447
I was just being honest
with them.
(Wade chuckles)

05:13.481 --> 05:15.849
George, this is Presley-- she
works for a beer distributor.

05:15.883 --> 05:16.850
Presley, George Tucker,

05:16.884 --> 05:18.051
Southern gentleman

05:18.085 --> 05:19.553
of the old school.
Hmm.

05:19.587 --> 05:20.954
That's funny.
He's old-school,

05:20.988 --> 05:22.690
and his dates are still
 in school.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.958
WADE:
Oh! Zinger.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.427
See ya, Rhett.
Wow.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.430
She seems nice.
(clears throat)

05:29.463 --> 05:31.899
George Tucker,
what is going on?

05:31.932 --> 05:33.434
I don't even know, Wade.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.469
Last week, I had
my yearly tax seminar.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.837
It's usually only attended
by Dash

05:36.870 --> 05:38.105
and Sergeant Jeffries and Shula.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.973
This year:
standing room only.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.208
All single women.
Well,

05:41.241 --> 05:44.111
I guess they heard that George
Tucker is back on the market.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.579
Hey, good
for you, buddy.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.648
I guess so.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.917
I'll tell you what--
I'm exhausted.
(laughs)

05:49.950 --> 05:52.453
I am. No, is this what
it's like to be you?

05:52.486 --> 05:54.688
Uh... yeah, yeah.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.857
I mean, come on, sure.
Absolutely.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.692
(chuckles)
Oh, it's Halloween.
You gonna try

05:58.726 --> 05:59.827
and break your record
from last year?

05:59.860 --> 06:01.862
What was it, three...
three sexy cats in one night?

06:01.895 --> 06:03.731
Uh... yeah, I'm...

06:03.764 --> 06:06.567
I'm kind of trying to lay off
the girls these days.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.836
It's, uh... it's like a cleanse.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.137
But for the record,

06:10.170 --> 06:12.440
it was two sexy cats
and one sexy Snow White.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.141
(phone vibrating)
Mmm.

06:14.174 --> 06:17.010
Uh, dude, I got to go.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.581
Hey, Wanda?
I'm going on break.

06:20.614 --> 06:21.882
Seriously?

06:21.915 --> 06:23.150
Again?

06:23.183 --> 06:25.085
*

06:31.191 --> 06:33.427
WADE:
All right, I only got

06:33.461 --> 06:35.128
15 minutes, but I promise
I'll make it worth your while.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.129
Wade, focus.
Whoa.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.165
I just bought a baseball bat,

06:38.198 --> 06:39.567
Mace

06:39.600 --> 06:41.902
and this wireless
video camera,

06:41.935 --> 06:44.872
which is why I texted you.
Can you install it?
Oh, yeah!

06:44.905 --> 06:46.774
Hey, uh...

06:46.807 --> 06:48.876
maybe we should get
one of those helmet cams.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.911
That way, I can see
what you see, which...

06:50.944 --> 06:52.446
I bet is pretty spectacular.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.881
Wade, tonight,
we are laying a trap

06:53.914 --> 06:55.115
to catch the cretin on film

06:55.148 --> 06:57.050
so that the sheriff
can arrest him.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.886
Or her. I'm open-minded.
Yeah,

06:58.919 --> 07:01.655
well... that's
a great plan, Doc.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.657
Problem is...

07:03.691 --> 07:06.594
A: It's probably just
somebody playing a prank,

07:06.627 --> 07:08.896
and B: I can't sleep
here tonight.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.531
I promised Wanda
I'd cover for her,

07:10.564 --> 07:12.800
so I won't be off
till about 3:00 a.m.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.702
If you're scared, you should
sleep over at Lavon's.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.637
I'm not scared.
I'm a New Yorker.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.906
I can handle a petty
BlueBell perv all by myself.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.909
You know, you are pretty sexy

07:21.942 --> 07:23.143
when you're in misguided
vigilante mode.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.516
We still got 13 minutes.

07:28.549 --> 07:31.485
Okay. Well, I do need
to make sure

07:31.519 --> 07:32.720
that the camera works.
Uh-huh.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.624
Mmm.
Mmm!

07:37.991 --> 07:40.761
Ooh!
(chuckles)

07:40.794 --> 07:43.664
(sighs)
Okay, so we are down
19 votes in the polls.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.866
22 if we can't sway
the postal workers.

07:45.899 --> 07:49.002
Lavon, I told you that
alligator is a liability.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.505
You know what? It's not too late
to get it stuffed. I know a guy.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.874
Burt Reynolds is my pet.
ANNABETH:
Well,

07:53.907 --> 07:56.209
maybe it's not too late to get
the Beaudrys over to our side.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.878
Oh, come on, AnnaBeth.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.079
You know that there's
nothing more divisive

07:59.112 --> 08:00.581
than a college football
allegiance.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.950
I mean, Rawlins & Sons
became Rawlins & Son

08:02.983 --> 08:04.818
when Frankie Jr. chose 'Bama.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.721
The Beaudrys are nice,
sensible people. I know them.

08:07.755 --> 08:08.989
Yes, we do not need reminding

08:09.022 --> 08:10.858
of your traitorous years
as an Auburn Tiger.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.994
For the zillionth time, I am
Auburn legacy, football legacy.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.263
My granddaddy was on
the '57 championship team.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.665
I had no choice.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.132
LAVON:
Uh, you know,
AnnaBeth does

08:19.166 --> 08:20.801
offer us a unique insight now.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.169
Okay, A.B.,

08:22.202 --> 08:24.738
what can we do to turn
the Beaudrys to our side?

08:24.772 --> 08:28.008
Well, show them you're not
just the voice of 'Bama.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.509
That you care.

08:30.578 --> 08:31.812
Maybe...

08:31.845 --> 08:34.246
you could say you're dating one.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.083
Wait, you're not suggesting...

08:37.116 --> 08:38.751
And not just a Tigers fan...

08:38.785 --> 08:39.787
Auburn royalty,

08:39.820 --> 08:40.788
football royalty.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.023
No! I mean,

08:43.056 --> 08:46.293
Lavon is not just gonna pretend
to date you to get the Beaudrys.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.596
Why not?
Well, now, Lemon,
you have to admit

08:48.629 --> 08:50.731
this is not the worst
idea in the world.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.200
22 votes. (chuckles)

08:53.233 --> 08:55.202
Oh! Yes!

08:55.235 --> 08:56.904
(AnnaBeth giggles)

08:56.937 --> 08:58.271
Huh?

08:58.305 --> 09:00.207
Go on, we look cute
together, right?

09:03.343 --> 09:05.178
(crickets chirping)

09:11.852 --> 09:13.921
(gasps)
Take that, psycho freak!
Aah!

09:13.954 --> 09:15.288
Aah!

09:15.322 --> 09:17.891
Ow!
George?

09:17.925 --> 09:19.827
Yes!

09:21.662 --> 09:22.930
(groans)

09:22.963 --> 09:24.932
Crap!

09:24.965 --> 09:27.635
(car horn honks)

09:27.668 --> 09:29.770
(seagulls calling)

09:29.803 --> 09:31.672
(birds singing)

09:39.246 --> 09:41.014
What were you thinking?
I could've seriously hurt you.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.750
You did seriously hurt me.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.285
(sniffs)
Oh, my God,
how did I get in here?

09:45.318 --> 09:46.620
Very funny.
No,

09:46.654 --> 09:48.221
I'm serious.
What did you do to me?

09:48.255 --> 09:50.090
What did I do to you?
 Yeah.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.259
Last thing I remember
is going to sleep in my own bed.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.161
Are you drunk?

09:54.194 --> 09:56.129
No! But to be honest with you,

09:56.163 --> 09:58.331
I am freaking out
a little bit, okay?

09:58.365 --> 10:00.300
I mean, I'm really freaking out!
Okay, well...

10:00.333 --> 10:01.902
This is...
Okay, um, look,

10:01.935 --> 10:04.137
we're gonna figure
this out, you know?

10:04.171 --> 10:06.707
Has anything else strange
been happening to you lately?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.310
Thursday, I woke up
with candy corn in my hair.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.313
Last night, I woke up
at the gas station.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.782
In my underwear.

10:14.815 --> 10:15.649
Where you going?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.251
Is this your toothbrush?

10:18.285 --> 10:20.954
Yes! I've been looking
for that. Wait...

10:20.988 --> 10:23.290
Why do you have it?
George,

10:23.323 --> 10:25.893
you have been sleepwalking.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.695
No.
Mm-hmm.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.129
No, no, no.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.064
Oh, yes.
That's impossible,
because I stopped...

10:31.098 --> 10:32.933
sleepwalking when
I was nine years old.

10:32.966 --> 10:33.934
So there's a history?

10:33.967 --> 10:34.968
Have you started

10:35.002 --> 10:36.336
to take any new medications

10:36.369 --> 10:39.406
or have you been eating
anything different?

10:39.439 --> 10:40.674
Candy corn?

10:40.708 --> 10:41.942
All right,
look, in adults,

10:41.975 --> 10:43.977
sleepwalking is usually
caused by stress.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.446
Has there been anything
stressing you out recently?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.448
No, actually,
everything's been great.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.051
I've been enjoying life
on my new houseboat.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.220
I'm sorry, did you
say "houseboat"?
Yeah.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.155
Are you kidding?
Do you know how dangerous

10:55.188 --> 10:57.224
it is to sleepwalk
when you're on a houseboat?

10:57.257 --> 10:59.226
Oh, my God, you're right.
All right, look,

10:59.259 --> 11:00.761
we just have to figure out
what's causing this.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.363
How about tonight
I come over,

11:03.396 --> 11:06.066
I attach an EEG machine
to you, and I watch you sleep?

11:07.400 --> 11:11.038
Okay, normally, that
would sound super fun...

11:11.071 --> 11:14.708
but there's a Halloween
party tonight, so...

11:14.742 --> 11:16.710
Oh.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.178
All right, well,
good, you know.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.313
Go to the party,
have a couple beers,

11:20.347 --> 11:21.314
and then go to sleep.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.783
All right, thank you, Zoe.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.384
Mm-hmm.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.454
Uh, you probably won't wind up
in the middle of the gulf,

11:27.487 --> 11:31.224
but just in case,
wear a life vest.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.796
See you tonight, Doctor.

11:35.829 --> 11:36.897
Mm-hmm.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.766
Happy Halloween.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.467
LEMON:
 Happy Halloween.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.502
I bought donuts.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.805
(screams)
(gasps)
Oh, God.

11:44.838 --> 11:45.973
Yeah.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.207
(chuckles)

11:47.240 --> 11:49.509
Wait, you said
I had to watch my weight

11:49.542 --> 11:50.277
to get the women's vote.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.216
Lavon, forget
the donuts, okay?

11:56.249 --> 11:58.786
I was up all night thinking
about AnnaBeth's little plan,

11:58.819 --> 12:00.353
and I just don't think
that it's a good idea.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.055
Lemon, look, I know
it's not ideal,

12:02.089 --> 12:04.958
but Ruby's not exactly
fighting fair, either.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.359
After all this work
on this campaign,

12:06.393 --> 12:09.429
I've realized something--
I-I want this bad.

12:09.462 --> 12:12.299
And, Lavon, you
are a great mayor,

12:12.332 --> 12:13.901
but what makes you great
is that you don't

12:13.934 --> 12:15.168
have to play any games.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.937
But 22 votes would seal
the deal, Lemon.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.839
You know that.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.373
Now, sometimes we got to think
about what's best for BlueBell.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.809
The...

12:21.842 --> 12:24.077
Guess what we're going to wear

12:24.111 --> 12:26.079
for our big debut
as a couple tonight.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.047
Romeo and Juliet.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.248
Genius, right?

12:28.281 --> 12:30.483
No, come on,
you guys, please.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.385
What?
It's a costume party.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.553
Star-crossed lovers.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.554
Come on.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.956
It's great.

12:37.324 --> 12:40.493
Well, people are going
to be mighty curious.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.262
They're going to want to know
how you got together,

12:42.295 --> 12:43.997
when, where,
what each other wore.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.565
I hope you're prepared
to answer those questions.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.468
Which is why I made
flash cards.

12:48.501 --> 12:49.469
Of course you did.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.471
Brilliant.
(chuckles)

12:51.504 --> 12:52.806
(AnnaBeth giggles)

12:54.241 --> 12:57.044
Martini.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.579
Shaken, not stirred.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.981
Dean Martin.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.916
Uh, waiter at Jean Georges.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.517
James Bond, wise-ass.
James Bond.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.354
Oh, well, it's sexy,
but I was kind of hoping

13:07.387 --> 13:09.857
for more of a Magic Mike
construction worker

13:09.890 --> 13:11.024
or a sexy firefighter,

13:11.058 --> 13:13.193
but, you know, hey, James
Bond-- definitely alluring.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.527
Just go put on
your go-go boots

13:14.561 --> 13:15.896
and your miniskirt
and let's get out of here.

13:15.929 --> 13:16.897
All right, come on.

13:16.930 --> 13:17.965
Oh, yeah, right,

13:17.998 --> 13:19.599
and people wouldn't
put us together?

13:19.632 --> 13:23.236
Who would they think I was--
the Morton Salt Girl?

13:23.270 --> 13:24.471
Is it wrong
that I'm okay with that?

13:24.504 --> 13:25.873
Yes.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.107
No, look, I can't.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.508
I'm tired and
I have to work.
Oh.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.243
I found my bed-sleeper.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.180
Oh, who was it--
Tom Long, Crickett?

13:33.213 --> 13:35.849
The poltergeist
from Poltergeist?

13:35.883 --> 13:38.151
No-- George Tucker.

13:38.185 --> 13:41.488
George Tucker?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.256
The same George Tucker
that I know?

13:43.290 --> 13:45.926
He was sleepwalking, so I have
to do a sleep study on him

13:45.959 --> 13:48.495
before the poor guy walks
into the gulf or worse.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.131
So, just to be clear here,
you're sending me off,

13:51.164 --> 13:53.366
looking like this,
to a party

13:53.400 --> 13:55.368
full of scantily clad women
high on free candy

13:55.402 --> 13:57.237
while you go spend the night
at George Tucker's?

13:58.906 --> 14:00.874
Yeah.

14:00.908 --> 14:04.311
Oh, this is an awesome
arrangement, yeah.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.519
How do I look?

14:13.954 --> 14:15.488
Hmm, ridiculous.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.858
Oh, come on, I feel
nervous enough.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.964
You look beautiful,
all right?

14:23.997 --> 14:28.068
You know, I think
this actually might work.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.236
Who knows?

14:29.269 --> 14:31.204
The Beaudrys do seem
sort of susceptible.

14:31.238 --> 14:36.109
Lemon, haven't you ever seen
a Patrick Dempsey movie?

14:36.143 --> 14:39.646
I mean, it might work out
for me and Lavon.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.615
We'll fake a relationship
for a while, but...

14:42.649 --> 14:45.418
eventually, he'll develop
real feelings for me.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.657
AnnaBeth, I know that
you've been known to comment

14:50.690 --> 14:52.592
on the mayor's physique,
but I didn't realize that...

14:52.625 --> 14:54.094
Yeah, I like him.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.529
I really like him.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.533
And I'm divorced now,

15:00.567 --> 15:03.236
so who's to say
he won't like me back?

15:04.537 --> 15:08.275
Yeah, well, good luck
with that, dear.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.979
I'm going to change.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.416
ZOE:
 So I am going

15:16.449 --> 15:18.485
to be taking notes
on anything you do

15:18.518 --> 15:19.519
and I'm going
to follow you

15:19.552 --> 15:21.254
if you sleepwalk,

15:21.288 --> 15:25.058
and hopefully we can discover
what's been stressing you out.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.394
The most important thing is to
try to stick to your routine

15:27.427 --> 15:29.162
as much as possible.
Okay, well...

15:29.196 --> 15:31.398
(clears throat)

15:31.431 --> 15:32.732
My routine doesn't
usually have you

15:32.765 --> 15:34.267
following me around
all night, so...

15:34.301 --> 15:35.535
You won't even notice
that I'm here.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.138
So what would you
usually do next?

15:38.171 --> 15:40.107
(sets down glass)

15:41.708 --> 15:43.643
Okay, uh,

15:43.676 --> 15:47.314
how about, for tonight, you
change maybe over there?

15:50.783 --> 15:53.420
(clears throat)

15:53.453 --> 15:56.623
You really think
this is a good idea?

15:56.656 --> 16:00.327
It's, um, our only
option at the moment.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.232
Okay.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.499
Whatever you say, Doc.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.036
(both sigh)

16:12.339 --> 16:14.207
(phone chimes,
Zoe clears throat)

16:17.377 --> 16:19.379
Someone named Daisy wants
to know

16:19.412 --> 16:23.450
if she should be a sexy nun
or a sexy referee.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.684
Really, those are
the only choices?

16:24.717 --> 16:25.518
Darn it.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.721
Forgot to tell Daisy
I couldn't make it tonight.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.692
Bedtime.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.327
Get in bed.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.267
All right.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.368
Scoot over a little.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.403
What, really?
Yeah.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.405
Yeah.
(sighs)

16:45.438 --> 16:48.508
You were going to be
a firefighter tonight?

16:48.541 --> 16:51.678
Yeah.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.647
Yeah, why, is that...
that's stupid, isn't it?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.683
No.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.654
Okay.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.822
All righty.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.257
(clears throat)

17:04.290 --> 17:05.258
Can you hold that
there for me?

17:05.291 --> 17:07.127
Yeah.
Thank you.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.429
*

17:13.200 --> 17:14.701
You really think
this is gonna work?

17:14.733 --> 17:16.035
Sure.

17:17.436 --> 17:19.372
Now go to sleep.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.808
(beeps)

17:21.840 --> 17:24.444
Just...
Yep.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.412
Just pretend
that I'm not here.

17:25.444 --> 17:26.413
Yeah.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.681
(chuckles)

17:28.715 --> 17:30.150
That's going to be
pretty much impossible.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.588
Good night, Dr. Hart.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.231
(sighs)

17:44.264 --> 17:45.265
Sweet dreams.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.336
(sighs)

18:03.883 --> 18:05.485
George.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.488
George!

18:17.264 --> 18:19.199
*

18:19.232 --> 18:20.767
(high-pitched scream)

18:22.302 --> 18:25.472
* What are you talkin' about?

18:27.840 --> 18:30.777
* I don't really wanna do this
on the phone *

18:33.680 --> 18:37.684
* Whatever you were gonna say,
you should have said it by now *

18:39.319 --> 18:41.254
* Why don't you call a cab

18:41.288 --> 18:43.856
* And just go home?

18:43.890 --> 18:47.760
* 'Cause I've heard
it all before *

18:47.794 --> 18:49.596
* I just don't wanna hear
any more... *

18:49.629 --> 18:50.897
George couldn't make it.

18:50.930 --> 18:55.502
So, Wade Kinsella,
it's your lucky night.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.571
Three wishes-- you can have
anything you want.

18:58.605 --> 19:01.541
Uh, thanks, Savannah.

19:01.574 --> 19:04.211
Uh, I can't.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.512
I'm on the clock.

19:05.545 --> 19:08.481
What's that, Cody?
You need another drink?

19:08.515 --> 19:11.618
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.686
What?
Huh?

19:13.720 --> 19:14.554
Yeah.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.555
Hey.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.326
What does Lemon Breeland drink?

19:19.359 --> 19:23.363
Uh, a white wine spritzer,
gin on a bad day.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.468
Here.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.437
You got a 50-50 shot.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.206
Knock 'em out, buddy.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.808
* I'm too tired
and you're too drunk... *

19:35.842 --> 19:39.746
I'm just going to go up to her
and ask her how she's doing.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.914
Cody, that is
so not a good idea.

19:43.983 --> 19:48.521
* A thousand pretty words
ain't gonna mean that much... *

19:48.555 --> 19:50.423
CODY:
Hey, Lemon, I just
happened to have

19:50.457 --> 19:52.459
this extra white wine spritzer.
I thought we could...

19:52.492 --> 19:54.727
Not now, Cody!

19:54.761 --> 19:56.529
WOMAN:
No way.

19:56.563 --> 19:59.466
You two?
AnnaBeth, I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.600
DASH:
Well,

20:00.633 --> 20:02.869
the Blawk has an exclusive

20:02.902 --> 20:04.604
on BlueBell's newest couple.

20:04.637 --> 20:05.605
Lavon Hayes

20:05.638 --> 20:07.440
and AnnaBeth Nass,

20:07.474 --> 20:08.341
is this y'all's
coming out party?

20:08.375 --> 20:09.342
LAVON:
Well, Dash,

20:09.376 --> 20:10.977
I can neither confirm nor deny

20:11.010 --> 20:12.845
my relationship status now,

20:12.879 --> 20:16.749
but I will say this--
this is one happy Halloween.

20:16.783 --> 20:17.850
(laughs)
Well,

20:17.884 --> 20:18.985
will y'all be going
by LavonaBeth

20:19.018 --> 20:21.721
or the shorter AnnaBon?

20:21.754 --> 20:23.556
Uh, no.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.326
* 'Cause I'm sorry
on the rocks... *

20:26.359 --> 20:29.429
Hey, hey, look who Lavon
just came in with.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.931
* Baby, just ain't
good enough... *

20:31.964 --> 20:33.333
AnnaB...?

20:33.366 --> 20:34.701
Nope, I cannot go there.

20:34.734 --> 20:35.835
Okay, look,
there's an emergency.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.570
Please tell me
that George is here.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.838
You lost him?

20:38.871 --> 20:42.675
I may have fallen asleep.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.011
Well, it's your fault
that I'm so tired.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.846
Yeah, it is.
All right, look,
this is serious.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.815
I need you
to help me find George.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.483
Yeah.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.485
Hey, Wanda, will
you cover for me?

20:52.519 --> 20:53.686
I got something I
need to take care of.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.687
Again?

20:54.721 --> 20:55.988
Do you even work here anymore?

21:02.662 --> 21:06.566
Mrs. Beaudry, I'm so
happy you're here.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.436
Why wouldn't I be?
It's Halloween.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.070
Uh, you know
my boyfriend,

21:11.103 --> 21:12.805
the mayor, of course?

21:12.839 --> 21:14.741
Mrs. Beaudry,
pleasure as always.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.043
You're dating the mayor?

21:17.076 --> 21:19.479
Does your father know?

21:19.512 --> 21:21.314
Oh, it all
happened so fast.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.715
As you know,
I'm an Auburn girl,

21:22.749 --> 21:24.417
and not very political,

21:24.451 --> 21:26.052
but I was helping Lemon
Breeland out one afternoon,

21:26.085 --> 21:28.655
making posters,
and Lavon

21:28.688 --> 21:31.958
was speaking
with such passion for BlueBell.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.826
Oh, what can I say?

21:33.860 --> 21:35.695
I love this town.

21:35.728 --> 21:36.796
ANNABETH:
Don't be so modest,

21:36.829 --> 21:38.465
sweetie pie.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.367
We all know that
local business revenue

21:40.400 --> 21:42.101
has gone up 16% under you,

21:42.134 --> 21:43.936
and how you spearheaded

21:43.970 --> 21:45.505
the new electric grid.

21:45.538 --> 21:46.806
Well, that is impressive.
Well,

21:46.839 --> 21:50.410
all right,
that's enough, now, love bug.

21:50.443 --> 21:51.611
LAVON:
She is so beautiful

21:51.644 --> 21:52.945
and smart and charming,

21:52.979 --> 21:54.481
but she can get a little

21:54.514 --> 21:55.948
overenthusiastic.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.450
Well, now, Mr. Hayes,

21:57.484 --> 21:59.419
if you are good enough
for the granddaughter

21:59.452 --> 22:01.521
of the great Auburn Tiger
quarterback

22:01.554 --> 22:04.824
Hubert Thibodaux,
may he rest in peace,

22:04.857 --> 22:05.958
then the least

22:05.992 --> 22:08.861
we Beaudrys can do
is join you for a drink,

22:08.895 --> 22:10.763
hear what you've got to say.
All right.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.104
Wanda...

22:18.137 --> 22:19.639
I'm switching to gin.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.607
Ooh.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.478
Damn it, I was sure
he would be here.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.647
This is, like,
his sleepwalking safe space.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.582
Don't you find it
just a little bit convenient

22:29.616 --> 22:31.718
that his safe space
just happens to be your bed?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.853
Oh, well, you think
he's faking it? Come on.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.723
Look, all I know is that you're
sleeping at his house the one

22:36.756 --> 22:38.591
holiday of the year you could've
been dressed as Catwoman.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.126
I would so never be Catwoman.

22:40.159 --> 22:41.628
Look, George
is not faking

22:41.661 --> 22:43.763
a sleep disorder to seduce me,
and you know it.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.732
If he was,
don't you think

22:45.765 --> 22:48.134
he would've made a move instead
of disappearing into the night?

22:48.167 --> 22:49.602
Just admit this is
a little more complicated

22:49.636 --> 22:51.871
than a simple doctor/patient
scenario, okay?

22:51.904 --> 22:54.507
George has
a true medical condition.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.743
And as his doctor,
it is my job,

22:56.776 --> 22:58.711
my duty to find him
before he hurts himself.

22:58.745 --> 23:01.448
Now, are you coming or what?

23:01.481 --> 23:02.749
Oh! (spits)

23:02.782 --> 23:05.752
Nice.
Crap! Come on.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.754
The preservations
at Town Hall,

23:07.787 --> 23:09.556
the new library
at the high school.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.424
The man has done
so much for this town.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.826
I figured looking past
his poor choice in college

23:13.860 --> 23:16.596
was the Christian
thing to do.

23:16.629 --> 23:17.530
(laughs)

23:21.067 --> 23:22.502
LAVON:
Will y'all excuse me?

23:22.535 --> 23:23.770
Mmm.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.775
(laughs)
We did it.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.910
Maybe.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.079
But I have to say, I wish
I could've stopped you,

23:34.647 --> 23:36.783
You are lying to
these people, Lavon.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.485
And this little charade

23:38.518 --> 23:40.186
just proves that
you are no better

23:40.219 --> 23:42.489
than Ruby Jeffries
herself.

23:42.522 --> 23:43.590
Frankly,
I'm not even sure

23:43.623 --> 23:45.758
that you're someone
I feel like voting for anymore.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.465
Come on, Mr. Mayor.

23:52.499 --> 23:55.001
Let's have ourselves a
celebratory slow dance.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.770
O-Okay.
(laughs)

23:57.804 --> 23:59.972
* I hear you turn the key

24:00.006 --> 24:02.141
* I hear you close the door

24:02.174 --> 24:04.143
* I recognize your face

24:04.176 --> 24:06.178
* Don't know you anymore

24:06.212 --> 24:08.948
* You play the part so well

24:11.017 --> 24:13.520
* And that's what hurts
like hell *

24:15.221 --> 24:17.524
* It's not the things you do

24:17.557 --> 24:19.492
* It's all the things
you don't... *

24:19.526 --> 24:20.760
George!

24:20.793 --> 24:23.796
You made it.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.633
I was beginning to think
you ditched us.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.167
Want to dance?

24:28.200 --> 24:30.169
No, no, I can't.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.804
And why not?

24:31.838 --> 24:32.939
George!

24:34.173 --> 24:35.908
Zoe.
Are you okay?

24:35.942 --> 24:38.044
Who is this?

24:39.278 --> 24:40.980
Oh, uh...

24:41.013 --> 24:42.081
this is my girlfriend.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.518
Girlfriend?

24:46.786 --> 24:47.720
Uh-oh.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.872
GEORGE:
You look awfully
pretty this evening.

25:05.905 --> 25:09.141
Oh, George, that is so
not necessary.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.509
Just set him down,
all right?

25:11.911 --> 25:14.513
Hello, sir.
Okay, here you go.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.084
You know, I always
figured Tucker

25:18.117 --> 25:19.285
had dreams about you.

25:19.318 --> 25:20.753
I just never figured
I'd be in one.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.188
Well, he doesn't know
what he's saying.

25:22.221 --> 25:23.723
Yeah, well, why don't
you wake him up?

25:23.756 --> 25:24.591
We'll have a real
conversation.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.158
Sleepwalking
is a very delicate sate.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.027
I mean, when people wake up,
they can freak out.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.161
Which is why
I need you to help me

25:29.195 --> 25:30.663
get him home.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.601
(sighing):
All right.

25:34.634 --> 25:35.868
Hey!

25:35.902 --> 25:38.170
Backdraft, let's go.
Come on. Bring your ax.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.006
No, thank you, sir.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.174
We do not need
a maitre d' to help us.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.309
We have been here many times.

25:43.342 --> 25:46.045
Bond. James Bond.

25:46.078 --> 25:48.648
Where?
I'm sorry.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.788
I can't believe
we pulled this off.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.323
You're such a good actor.

25:57.356 --> 25:58.925
Well, you, uh...

25:58.958 --> 26:01.293
you did a great job, AnnaBell.
I owe you.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.862
Oh, I owe you.
I've wanted

26:02.895 --> 26:04.764
to wear matching costumes
with someone for years

26:04.797 --> 26:07.734
and you finally gave
me the opportunity.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.802
I was thinking
maybe tomorrow it might be fun

26:09.836 --> 26:12.639
if we went to Dash's one-man
show of Macbeth together.

26:12.672 --> 26:13.906
Just to really hammer
it home, huh?

26:13.940 --> 26:15.341
Uh...

26:16.843 --> 26:18.277
Ah.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.279
Mrs. Beaudry,
great to see you.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.214
I just want to say...

26:22.248 --> 26:23.683
there's not a lot in life

26:23.716 --> 26:26.819
I take more seriously
than college football,

26:26.853 --> 26:28.154
but electing a man

26:28.187 --> 26:30.089
my grandbabies can look up to--

26:30.122 --> 26:31.658
well, that's
worth being

26:31.691 --> 26:33.059
a little bit
of a traitor, right?

26:34.126 --> 26:35.862
Absolutely!

26:35.895 --> 26:37.329
You can count on our votes.

26:37.363 --> 26:40.700
Thank you, ma'am.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.936
Did you hear that?

26:43.970 --> 26:45.271
22 votes.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.640
It's a Halloween miracle.

26:47.674 --> 26:49.976
I'm-I'm...
No, I'm sorry.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.611
I got to go find Lemon.

26:55.982 --> 26:56.949
All right, two Gremlins

26:56.983 --> 26:59.418
and a Spooky Juice.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.153
It'll be $10.50.
Thank you, sir.

27:02.889 --> 27:04.123
Oh, crap.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.325
Hey, Carrie.
Vodka soda for you?

27:06.358 --> 27:08.861
Wow, you remembered.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.897
I can't be the only
slutty nurse in here tonight.

27:12.732 --> 27:13.966
(laughs)
Uh...

27:14.000 --> 27:15.868
Oops. Did I say slutty?

27:15.902 --> 27:17.103
Well, I don't know.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.137
Oh, wait.
What's the hurry?

27:18.170 --> 27:19.305
Uh...

27:19.338 --> 27:20.873
well, you know,

27:20.907 --> 27:22.208
busy night.

27:22.241 --> 27:23.843
Aw, seems like someone

27:23.876 --> 27:26.345
could use a break.

27:26.378 --> 27:29.181
Well, uh, I would, but...

27:29.215 --> 27:30.382
five vampires at the other end

27:30.416 --> 27:31.450
of the bar, so...
You sure had

27:31.483 --> 27:33.886
time for a break
last Halloween.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.689
And as I recall,
it was a pretty long one.

27:36.723 --> 27:37.690
(chuckles)

27:37.724 --> 27:39.425
Well, things have changed.

27:39.458 --> 27:41.293
Like what things?

27:41.327 --> 27:44.096
Well... (clears throat)

27:44.130 --> 27:45.698
there are rules now.

27:45.732 --> 27:47.033
You know,
I'm not, uh,

27:47.066 --> 27:48.835
exactly sure what those rules
are, but...

27:48.868 --> 27:49.969
there are rules.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.206
Hey, you know what?

27:54.240 --> 27:56.108
There... there are rules.

27:58.477 --> 28:00.246
Where are you going?

28:00.279 --> 28:03.249
I'm going
to enforce those rules.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.787
You look good, Carrie.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.021
Drink's on me.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.427
Are you sure you
want to do this now?

28:15.461 --> 28:16.963
I mean, I could write
a press release

28:16.996 --> 28:18.064
and smooth things over.

28:18.097 --> 28:21.200
No, it's my mess.

28:21.233 --> 28:24.070
I'm gonna clean it up.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.072
(clears throat)

28:26.105 --> 28:27.439
Excuse me,
Mrs. Beaudry.

28:27.473 --> 28:31.243
Oh, boy, everything in my life
has come easy to me.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.479
You know, I've never really
faced a challenge

28:33.512 --> 28:35.815
like this election before.

28:35.848 --> 28:38.050
But I guess we really
don't know ourselves

28:38.084 --> 28:40.386
until we're put in a place
where we're tested.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.121
And, I don't
like what I saw

28:42.154 --> 28:43.489
in myself when I was.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.928
AnnaBeth and I aren't dating.

28:48.961 --> 28:51.097
I made the
whole thing up,

28:51.130 --> 28:53.265
hoping to get votes.

28:55.001 --> 28:56.836
I'm sorry.

28:58.504 --> 29:00.907
Well...

29:00.940 --> 29:03.910
then I guess you'll understand
when I tell you...

29:03.943 --> 29:06.813
politics like this...

29:06.846 --> 29:10.049
is why we Beaudrys never
registered in the first place.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.483
Yes, ma'am.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.052
But now we will
be voting...

29:13.085 --> 29:14.286
for the Jeffries girl.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.158
Thank you for your time.

29:21.493 --> 29:25.097
Hubert Thibodaux is rolling over
in his grave

29:25.131 --> 29:26.866
right now, young lady!

29:34.974 --> 29:35.975
Well, that sucked.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.980
You did the right thing.

29:41.013 --> 29:43.049
I'm proud of you.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.818
Who would've ever thought
that I'd be the one to...

29:45.852 --> 29:47.987
bring down the campaign
with my crazy schemes?

29:51.323 --> 29:53.192
I should have listened to you.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.594
I won't make that mistake again.

29:55.627 --> 29:56.963
Good.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.430
(both laugh)

29:58.464 --> 30:01.167
But, hey, this race
is far from over.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.169
And we may be down in votes,
but I know that this town

30:03.202 --> 30:04.470
will come
to its senses,

30:04.503 --> 30:06.372
and we will win this thing.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.542
(sighs)

30:10.576 --> 30:13.579
(grunts)

30:13.612 --> 30:16.382
Sometimes I feel
like you believe in me

30:16.415 --> 30:18.084
even more than I
believe in myself.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.992
(sighs)

30:28.560 --> 30:30.930
I don't know what I'd do
without you, Lemon Breeland.

30:30.963 --> 30:33.265
I really don't.

30:34.666 --> 30:39.939
Well, I better get some sleep.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.273
I have a big day

30:41.307 --> 30:43.409
of strategizing to do tomorrow.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.879
Good night.

30:46.913 --> 30:49.248
Night.

30:53.152 --> 30:54.553
All right, come on.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.288
Let's get you to bed.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.591
(groans)

30:59.625 --> 31:02.094
Okay.

31:02.128 --> 31:03.529
You going to bed now?

31:03.562 --> 31:04.964
Mm-hmm.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.465
That is a good idea.

31:06.498 --> 31:10.136
It has been a long day,
and I am very tired.

31:15.507 --> 31:18.577
So, we're together, huh?

31:19.678 --> 31:21.380
Duh.

31:23.182 --> 31:24.883
You are acting weird.

31:28.154 --> 31:30.222
George, are we happy?

31:30.256 --> 31:32.424
How can we not be?

31:35.027 --> 31:36.662
Zoe, you and I--

31:36.695 --> 31:39.999
we belong...

31:40.032 --> 31:41.467
(Zoe gasps and screams)

31:41.500 --> 31:42.935
(screaming)

31:42.969 --> 31:44.070
(gasping)

31:44.103 --> 31:46.472
Wade, he was
sleepwalking!

31:46.505 --> 31:47.974
I know he was.

31:48.007 --> 31:50.542
What's your excuse?

31:50.576 --> 31:52.544
What?

31:52.578 --> 31:54.981
I'm up. I'm up.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.015
(panting)

32:05.024 --> 32:06.425
(sniffling)

32:06.458 --> 32:08.160
(sighs)

32:08.194 --> 32:09.928
Okay, what happened tonight?

32:13.399 --> 32:17.236
You had yourself quite
an adventure there, fire chief.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.737
Ah.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.340
Here. It's hot.
Thank you.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.342
(phone chimes)

32:23.375 --> 32:25.311
Oh. It's from Daisy.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.281
"Hey, jerkface." Oh.

32:29.315 --> 32:32.451
"Why didn't you tell me
you had a girlfriend?

32:32.484 --> 32:34.220
I call foul."
What the hell?

32:34.253 --> 32:37.323
Well, oh, she was dressed
as a sexy referee.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.125
No, Zoe, what girlfriend?

32:39.158 --> 32:42.061
Oh. Well, as it turns out,

32:42.094 --> 32:44.663
in your dream state,
you are in a relationship.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.067
With?

32:48.100 --> 32:50.602
Hmm?
With?

32:50.636 --> 32:52.638
Me.

32:52.671 --> 32:56.675
If I had to speculate,
you know, as your physician,

32:56.708 --> 32:59.645
it-it might mean

32:59.678 --> 33:02.048
that a small part of you is...

33:02.081 --> 33:04.050
still hung up on me.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.651
Which would probably explain

33:05.684 --> 33:08.220
you walking into my house
in the middle of the night

33:08.254 --> 33:11.023
and leaving your toothbrush.

33:11.057 --> 33:14.526
Well, it's not really
that big of a surprise, is it?

33:16.662 --> 33:20.466
Zoe, a part of me
still is hung up on you.

33:22.701 --> 33:25.003
Like, a big, big part.

33:26.805 --> 33:30.309
Like, pretty much... most of me,
like, all of me.

33:32.811 --> 33:35.514
Question is...

33:35.547 --> 33:38.016
why aren't we together again?

33:44.423 --> 33:45.791
Oh, no.

33:45.824 --> 33:48.094
No.
Relax.

33:48.127 --> 33:52.364
It's purely a
social visit.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.066
(sighs)
Go ahead, help yourself.

33:56.402 --> 33:59.171
Same drink,
same swagger.

33:59.205 --> 34:01.540
Not the same guy, though.

34:01.573 --> 34:03.542
The one who left town
and never called.

34:03.575 --> 34:06.278
The one who used to
do that stupid dance

34:06.312 --> 34:08.280
every time he
sacked a QB.

34:08.313 --> 34:09.648
Now, that dance wasn't stupid.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.650
You've changed.

34:11.683 --> 34:14.152
You've grown up.

34:14.186 --> 34:16.355
Maybe it's time for me to do
a little growing up, too.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.692
Lavon, I'm sorry for
sabotaging you with the Owls.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.428
That was a low blow.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.295
I think we've
just both gotten

34:24.330 --> 34:26.565
a little caught up
with this campaign.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.766
But you had the balls
to apologize to the Beaudrys,

34:28.800 --> 34:30.402
and-and that's what I'm doing
right now.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.704
I'm apologizing to you.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.473
I'm sorry.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.145
Accepted.

34:39.178 --> 34:41.313
Partly because
of that speech,

34:41.347 --> 34:43.581
and partly because
of that outfit.

34:43.614 --> 34:45.851
I'll take that.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.456
Go and sit down.

34:53.525 --> 34:55.261
Go on.

34:55.293 --> 34:57.429
I'll buy you your own drink.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.366
(laughs)

35:02.568 --> 35:05.204
Hopefully, if you let
some of this stress go,

35:05.237 --> 35:06.872
the sleepwalking will subside.

35:06.905 --> 35:08.740
In the meantime, I'm gonna
prescribe a mild sedative.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.146
So that's it, huh?

35:15.414 --> 35:17.183
I don't know what else to say.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.817
Well, why don't you
answer my question?

35:18.850 --> 35:21.420
Come on, George.
I'm serious.

35:21.453 --> 35:25.257
You think that I'm not
still hung up on you, too?

35:25.291 --> 35:26.725
Well, I don't know.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.694
Uh... (laughs) Are you?

35:28.727 --> 35:32.231
Of course I am,
but I meant what I said.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.900
We have to think
in terms of the long game.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.935
Now is not our time.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.604
I can't be your rebound.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.872
I can't get my heart broken
by you again.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.741
Okay, Zoe, and I'm doing
everything that I can

35:42.774 --> 35:44.376
to make sure that
does not happen.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.178
I'm out there sowing
my wild oats.

35:46.212 --> 35:48.547
I've been on 13 dates
in three weeks.
But you can't just

35:48.580 --> 35:51.183
go through the motions, biding
time until you can be with me.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.384
That is not moving on.

35:52.418 --> 35:53.852
And if you haven't moved on,

35:53.885 --> 35:55.754
then how could I not
be your rebound?

35:55.787 --> 35:57.556
What exactly is it
that you want from me?

35:57.589 --> 36:00.792
I can't believe
that I'm gonna say this.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.729
(sighs)

36:03.762 --> 36:06.398
Maybe to help you move on,

36:06.432 --> 36:08.934
to stop thinking about me,

36:08.967 --> 36:11.803
to sleep,

36:11.837 --> 36:13.805
you need to be with someone

36:13.839 --> 36:15.841
that you actually
feel something for.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.481
Because I kind of am.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.653
I see.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.290
Who is it?
Uh, you know what?

36:31.323 --> 36:33.425
I don't want to know.

36:33.459 --> 36:35.661
Is it serious?

36:35.694 --> 36:38.464
No.

36:40.432 --> 36:41.967
But it's what I need right now.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.305
Okay.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.307
Good night, George.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.619
Good night, Zoe.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.634
Thank you.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.739
Large tea with honey,
and whatever she's having.

37:20.772 --> 37:23.709
Just coffee
with cream and sugar.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.345
Thank you.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.546
You kidding?

37:27.579 --> 37:28.980
I should be
thanking you.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.482
It may have
been misguided,

37:30.516 --> 37:32.451
but you took a big risk
for this campaign.

37:32.484 --> 37:33.885
You really tried.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.587
It was a stupid idea.
Thank you.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.022
I don't know
what I was thinking.

37:37.055 --> 37:39.891
You must think
I'm an idiot.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.829
AnnaBeth Nass, you
are not an idiot.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.697
You're a romantic.

37:45.731 --> 37:49.501
A romantic idiot.

37:49.535 --> 37:51.970
Well, it's one thing I've
learned about this life--

37:52.003 --> 37:53.639
it's that you can't
control the heart.

37:53.672 --> 37:56.308
Sometimes feelings
just pop up.

37:56.342 --> 37:58.644
They reemerge from out the blue.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.078
Doesn't make us foolish.

38:00.111 --> 38:03.315
It just... makes us human.

38:05.417 --> 38:07.052
Well, the good news is,

38:07.085 --> 38:09.621
there are still six days left
in this campaign.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.557
Six days of working
very closely with the mayor.

38:13.091 --> 38:14.326
Anything could happen, right?

38:15.627 --> 38:17.363
You know, you're right.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.599
Anything could happen.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.601
(laughs)

38:26.037 --> 38:28.740
(clears throat)

38:28.774 --> 38:30.776
Hey, Daisy.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.444
Uh, may I sit?

38:32.478 --> 38:34.380
If you must.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.784
(laughs)

38:38.817 --> 38:42.120
I just wanted to clear some
things up from last night.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.623
Um... I don't
have a girlfriend.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.025
There was a whole
misunderstanding.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.695
I was... not
myself last night.

38:49.728 --> 38:52.097
Really?

38:52.130 --> 38:54.766
Yes.

38:54.800 --> 38:58.570
Yeah. But, uh, the thing is...

38:58.604 --> 39:00.972
well, last night,

39:01.006 --> 39:03.775
I had my first
decent night's sleep

39:03.809 --> 39:06.478
in a long time, and it
gave me some clarity.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.880
And...

39:08.914 --> 39:11.583
well, I just want to
say that I don't think

39:11.617 --> 39:14.019
that you and I have a future
together, and I'm sorry

39:14.052 --> 39:15.754
that I led you on.

39:17.856 --> 39:21.860
I guess I can't fault you
for being honest.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.763
(sighs)
Okay. All right.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.132
Thank you.
Oh, and could you

39:27.165 --> 39:28.700
tell Savannah the same thing?

39:28.734 --> 39:30.469
'Cause I cannot find her number.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.475
PRESLEY:
Well, if it isn't

39:36.508 --> 39:38.777
the world's first
authentic Southern gentleman.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.512
Oh.

39:40.546 --> 39:41.880
Great. Good morning.

39:41.913 --> 39:42.981
Presley, is it?

39:43.014 --> 39:44.650
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

39:44.683 --> 39:46.885
Oh, don't worry. I'll be out
of here in a minute.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.987
I'm sure you need this seat
for another lady friend.
No.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.490
No, actually, you can
keep that seat all day,

39:51.523 --> 39:53.124
'cause I am all out
of lady friends.

39:53.158 --> 39:54.893
Really?
Yeah.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.562
I can't imagine
what went wrong.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.430
Oh. (laughs)
Big surprise, right?

39:58.464 --> 39:59.631
Mmm.
Just...

39:59.665 --> 40:01.032
(sighs)

40:01.066 --> 40:03.168
No, it just turns
out that we didn't...

40:03.201 --> 40:05.704
have as much in
common as I thought.

40:05.737 --> 40:09.140
Think I might need to
find somebody who...

40:09.174 --> 40:10.509
challenges me a little bit.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.511
Mmm.

40:16.882 --> 40:19.518
Which is why I was
wondering if you might

40:19.551 --> 40:20.952
be free for
dinner tonight.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.590
What?

40:24.623 --> 40:25.791
Look, I won't be
a gentleman at all.

40:25.824 --> 40:26.825
Okay, none of that.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.494
You can pay for it
if you want.

40:28.527 --> 40:29.561
You can pay for
the whole thing.
Mmm.

40:31.697 --> 40:33.865
(chuckles)

40:33.899 --> 40:35.701
Drinks, no dinner,

40:35.734 --> 40:38.504
and if you show up
wearing a tie, I'm leaving.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.873
Sounds great.

40:45.677 --> 40:46.912
(knocking)

40:49.114 --> 40:51.850
(clears throat)

40:51.883 --> 40:53.485
You were right.

40:53.519 --> 40:55.754
I let things get out
of control last night.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.656
I know.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.224
Well, I'm-I'm sorry.

41:01.693 --> 41:03.762
Look, if you want me to tell you

41:03.795 --> 41:05.230
that George and I
don't still have feelings

41:05.263 --> 41:06.732
for each other, I can't.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.700
I wish I could.

41:08.734 --> 41:10.602
Okay.

41:10.636 --> 41:12.771
But I meant what I said.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.105
That I want to be monogamous.

41:14.139 --> 41:17.208
And from now on,
I will remember that.

41:17.242 --> 41:19.611
If it means anything,

41:19.645 --> 41:23.081
I told George that
I was involved with someone.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.186
Wade?

41:30.856 --> 41:32.891
Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

41:34.793 --> 41:39.164
I'm... sleeping.

41:39.197 --> 41:41.633
In fact, I think it's time

41:41.667 --> 41:43.001
for you to put me
to bed, missy.
No! No!

41:43.034 --> 41:44.736
Oh, yeah, mm-hmm.

41:44.770 --> 41:46.271
It's time to put this girl
down for the night.
Oh, my God.

41:46.304 --> 41:48.073
Watch your head.
We're going in.
Oh.

41:48.106 --> 41:50.041
