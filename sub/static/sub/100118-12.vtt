WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:03.960
Previouslyon Dynasty...FALLON:
I am moving out of the manor.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.875
Even if you're losing
Blake, you still got me.

00:05.918 --> 00:09.052
You poisoned him?I lost control of my life

00:09.096 --> 00:11.315
when I lost
Carrington Atlantic.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.925
If I advise the board to sell...

00:12.969 --> 00:14.405
I think we can
discuss that.

00:28.898 --> 00:32.249
Was there anything else?
Or anyone else?

00:32.293 --> 00:34.425
I guess not.
Looks like it's just me.

00:34.469 --> 00:36.079
Enjoy, sir.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.689
Actually,
there is something I need.

00:37.733 --> 00:41.084
I've decided to take control
of my life once again, Anders,

00:41.128 --> 00:43.260
which means getting
Carrington Atlantic back.

00:43.304 --> 00:47.699
You mentioned that.
#Goals, as they say.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.788
You know, I've allowed
my family to push me out,

00:49.832 --> 00:52.443
but Carrington Atlantic is my
legacy and it always has been.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.097
Unfortunately,
it's part

00:54.141 --> 00:57.100
of Van Kirk Industries,
who just received an offer

00:57.144 --> 00:58.275
from an Oakley Corp.

00:58.319 --> 00:59.929
I've never heard of Oakley Corp.

00:59.972 --> 01:02.279
Find out who's behind it,
as well as their offer.

01:02.323 --> 01:03.715
Maybe I can outbid them

01:03.759 --> 01:06.240
before it goes before
the VKI board for approval.

01:06.283 --> 01:09.199
Very well. Bon appÃ©tit.

01:09.243 --> 01:10.461
What's your hurry? Join me.

01:10.505 --> 01:13.334
Cristal's visiting
family in Mexico,

01:13.377 --> 01:15.640
Sam's always
at the hotel working,

01:15.684 --> 01:18.556
Fallon moved out, and Adam...

01:18.600 --> 01:21.037
Was kicked out by you.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.344
Perhaps a miscalculation
on your part.

01:23.387 --> 01:26.042
The point is,
I wouldn't mind some company.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.435
We could really
catch up,

01:27.478 --> 01:29.350
just... talk.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.496
I assume we're done here, sir?

01:45.540 --> 01:47.281
Yeah, I think so.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.677
Damn.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.897
I should go away
on more writing retreats.

01:54.940 --> 01:58.379
You know, there's something hot
about hotel sex.

01:58.422 --> 01:59.815
Must be the change of scenery,

01:59.858 --> 02:02.383
or the minibar stocked
with overpriced chocolates.

02:02.426 --> 02:04.646
I got to say, I never
thought I'd see the day

02:04.689 --> 02:06.300
when you call it quits
at the manor.

02:06.343 --> 02:11.174
Well, let's just say that
Blake and I are on a sabbatical,

02:11.218 --> 02:14.395
but this one is permanent.

02:14.438 --> 02:17.311
Although, hotel life
is getting a bit mundane.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.313
Well, there is
always my place.

02:19.356 --> 02:22.446
What? And sleep in the same
bed as that pop-tart Ashley?

02:22.490 --> 02:25.623
No. I'd rather wear
low-rise jeans to brunch.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.103
Besides,

02:27.147 --> 02:29.540
it doesn't matter because
I won't be here for long.

02:29.584 --> 02:32.935
I... am gonna buy a house.

02:32.978 --> 02:36.156
Wow. Congratulations.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.462
Isn't that something we
should've talked about together?

02:38.506 --> 02:39.681
Oh, no, no, no, silly.

02:39.724 --> 02:41.509
I'm buying a house for me,
not for us.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.989
I figured, I've never lived
alone, and so it's something

02:44.033 --> 02:46.557
I should probably experience
at least once in my life.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.864
You know, people do live alone.Yeah, I've heard.

02:48.907 --> 02:50.387
I-I guess I just
thought we were more

02:50.431 --> 02:52.346
on the path
of living together.

02:52.389 --> 02:56.393
Don't worry, okay? This is just
a stop on my life journey,

02:56.437 --> 02:58.395
not the final destination,
all right?

02:58.439 --> 03:02.921
Besides, I am going to need your
help once I start the search.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.533
Mm. Done.

03:10.494 --> 03:13.236
I thought you already got
your treatment this week.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.195
Just getting
a little extra boost.

03:15.238 --> 03:16.674
I'll be fine.Actually, I had hoped

03:16.718 --> 03:19.155
your toxic metal levels
would be lower by now.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.766
So much for doctor-patient
confidentiality.Sorry.

03:21.810 --> 03:24.116
Let's just not
overdo things, okay?

03:24.160 --> 03:25.466
I'll see you
next week.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.469
I am concerned.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.819
What if these treatments
stop working?

03:30.862 --> 03:32.951
There has to be
something else we can do

03:32.995 --> 03:34.910
to stop this wretched disease.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.738
Trust me,
I've been looking into it.

03:36.781 --> 03:40.350
I even found this pharmaceutical
company named Chlorcyte Health.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.657
They've been working on a drug
to cure neurotoxicity.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.745
And?And they think

03:43.788 --> 03:45.660
it'll be at least five
to ten years

03:45.703 --> 03:47.662
before they have anything
to take to the FDA.

03:47.705 --> 03:50.273
They're not putting much money
into the research.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.101
They said it's, uh,
not a priority.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.798
So all we have to do
is buy the company

03:53.842 --> 03:55.583
and very quickly
make it a priority.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.454
What?

03:57.498 --> 03:59.543
I'm a Colby now, I think big.

03:59.587 --> 04:02.764
Well, hey, it means a lot
that you care,

04:02.807 --> 04:04.374
especially considering
our marriage

04:04.418 --> 04:06.855
is just a business arrangement.True, but if we're

04:06.898 --> 04:10.554
being honest, my bedroom has
been a little lonely at night.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.469
Should you ever
want to join me,

04:12.513 --> 04:15.472
we can always expand
our current agreement.

04:15.516 --> 04:18.867
Well, I appreciate the offer,
but I need to focus on my health

04:18.910 --> 04:22.523
while we wait for Van Kirk
to approve our purchase of C.A.

04:22.566 --> 04:25.047
I'll set a meeting tomorrow
about buying Chlorcyte.

04:25.090 --> 04:28.050
Oh, Jeff's buying you
companies already?

04:28.093 --> 04:30.444
Is that the typical
two weeks of marriage gift?

04:30.487 --> 04:33.621
I figured it would be
a set of knives or something.

04:33.664 --> 04:34.752
No, Dominique, no knives,

04:34.796 --> 04:37.407
though I do wish
one was handy right now.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.191
Mom, what are you
doing here?

04:39.235 --> 04:41.455
I just got in from New York,
wanted to say hello.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.413
Oh, well,
did you lose your phone?

04:43.457 --> 04:45.502
And I was also thinking that
maybe I would stay here

04:45.546 --> 04:47.635
for a while, to look after you.Here?

04:47.678 --> 04:49.201
In this house?

04:49.245 --> 04:50.420
Dominique,

04:50.464 --> 04:51.508
your wit knows no bounds.

04:51.552 --> 04:54.119
I wasn't joking.Neither am I.

04:54.163 --> 04:56.687
You and your bargain basement
wig collection

04:56.731 --> 04:58.210
can go find a one-bedroom
in Norcross

04:58.254 --> 04:59.690
because you are
not staying here.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.692
Okay, okay, uh,

05:01.736 --> 05:03.390
you heard her.

05:03.433 --> 05:04.869
Happy wife,
happy life, right?

05:04.913 --> 05:07.481
It's best you find
someplace else to go, Mom.

05:20.232 --> 05:21.495
Hey, stranger.

05:21.538 --> 05:24.846
Hey-hey. Kirby.
What brings you around?

05:24.889 --> 05:27.805
I know it's a long shot, but
I seem to have lost an earring.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.633
Did you find one here
the other night?I was wondering

05:29.677 --> 05:31.505
where that came from.
It's right there on the table.

05:31.548 --> 05:32.636
Oh, my gosh.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.681
I can't believe you found it.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.204
I thought it was gone forever.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.684
You know, it's actually
a really funny story

05:36.727 --> 05:38.163
about these earrings,
they're part of a lucky pair...

05:38.207 --> 05:40.383
I'm-I'm really sorry,
I-I can't stay and chat.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.080
I have a meeting
at Atlanta General.

05:42.124 --> 05:43.299
Oh, I didn't realize.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.561
I'm trying to get
my privileges there,

05:44.605 --> 05:46.171
so I can practice
medicine again.Cool.

05:46.215 --> 05:48.739
Yeah, I'm-I'm running late
for a thing, too, you know.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.959
I'm b-busy, busy.

05:51.002 --> 05:54.397
By the way, I had such a great
time at dinner the other night.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.225
Yeah? Me, too.

05:56.268 --> 05:57.748
Really?
Yeah.

05:57.792 --> 06:01.317
I-I got to run,
but I'll-I'll see you around.Yeah.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.015
See-see you around.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.803
A formal dining room
that only seats 16?

06:08.846 --> 06:10.718
I mean, do people
not entertain anymore?

06:10.761 --> 06:14.243
Ugh, I know, right?Oh, my God. What-what is this?

06:14.286 --> 06:15.549
Carpeting? I mean,
who has carpeting

06:15.592 --> 06:18.682
in their house these days?
Savages. Next!

06:18.726 --> 06:19.683
LIAM:
Fallon?

06:19.727 --> 06:21.032
JAX :
Hi.

06:21.076 --> 06:23.165
Jax Davis. You must be
one of the new interns.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.775
Down, boy,
he's with me.

06:24.819 --> 06:27.822
What are you doing? I-I thought
we were going house hunting.

06:27.865 --> 06:31.782
Oh, no, we are. It's just that
open houses are for peasants.

06:31.826 --> 06:34.959
Who has the time? This way,
the market comes to me.

06:35.003 --> 06:37.745
Laminate flooring? This place
should be condemned. Next.

06:37.788 --> 06:39.573
Hey, Fallon.

06:39.616 --> 06:42.445
I-I agreed I'd help you look
for a new house, all right,

06:42.489 --> 06:45.187
not watch you walk around
and bump into furniture.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.668
It's all right. I'm done anyway.

06:47.711 --> 06:50.758
This virtual tour was
a giant waste of real time.

06:50.801 --> 06:53.456
There's one listing
not online.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.545
Classic colonial
in the Wrightwood area.

06:55.589 --> 06:56.546
LIAM:
Ooh.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.374
Has its own peach tree farm.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.767
Little on the nose,
but whatevs.

06:59.810 --> 07:02.813
Wait, wait, wait.
Is this the house on the lake?

07:02.857 --> 07:04.119
With sweeping views?

07:05.294 --> 07:07.470
525 Wrightwood Drive?That's the one.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.472
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
It's fate.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.910
I used to go by this house
all the time when I was a kid.

07:12.954 --> 07:15.391
Sounds great.
We should go look at it.No, no.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.045
We don't need to look at it.
It's perfect.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.873
I know that I want it,
so get it for me.

07:18.916 --> 07:19.917
The owner's not accepting offers

07:19.961 --> 07:22.050
until the open house
later today.

07:22.093 --> 07:25.488
Well, I guess we're going
on a road trip after all.

07:25.532 --> 07:29.971
Well, at least I know you'll
never leave me, huh? Yeah.

07:30.014 --> 07:32.277
ANDERS: Sorry for
the delay, sir.

07:32.321 --> 07:35.106
My contacts at VKI
are a little tight-lipped

07:35.150 --> 07:37.152
about the sale
of Carrington Atlantic.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.546
Certainly was easier
when Fallon and Liam lived here.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.765
Had a direct line of access
to the Van Kirk family.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.419
What'd you find out
about the bid?

07:43.463 --> 07:46.248
Oh, it's sealed. However, if you
really want to know about that,

07:46.291 --> 07:48.772
you can always ask
the owner of Oakley Corp.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.253
Jeff Colby.
What?

07:51.296 --> 07:52.950
Are you sure?I'm afraid so, sir.

07:52.994 --> 07:55.300
Jeff and Alexis failed
to have you put in prison,

07:55.344 --> 07:57.738
so they've moved on
to the next best thing.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.696
Now they want your company.

08:01.742 --> 08:05.746
So... battle lines
have been drawn.

08:05.789 --> 08:09.489
Well, if it's war they want,
it's war they'll get.

08:35.210 --> 08:38.082
Can you please
go be Valentine's-y

08:38.126 --> 08:39.257
in the lounge or something?

08:39.301 --> 08:41.564
Thank you.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.523
KIRBY:
Wow.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.612
Someone's feeling
the love. You got

08:45.655 --> 08:47.962
special plans for you and
Fletcher's first V-Day together?

08:48.005 --> 08:51.879
Well, actually, he's away
on Atlantix business.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.315
Aw.

08:53.358 --> 08:55.099
Which is totally fine
because I'll be busy hosting

08:55.143 --> 08:57.275
La Mirage's
"Secret Admirer" party.

08:57.319 --> 08:58.799
Ooh, do tell.

08:58.842 --> 09:01.628
People send out an anonymous
letter to someone special,

09:01.671 --> 09:03.107
hoping that person will show up

09:03.151 --> 09:05.675
to find their admirer.
Then they meet, fall in love,

09:05.719 --> 09:08.504
book a hotel room,
everyone wins.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.114
That sounds really romantic.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.769
Unless, of course, the person
you invite doesn't show up.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.510
Then... then
that's sad for you.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.903
Are you sending that to someone?

09:15.946 --> 09:19.515
If you must know, I'm
crushing a little on Adam.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.605
Please tell me you mean
Adam Levine or Adam Sandler.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.042
I'll even accept a misguided
attempt at Adam Lambert.

09:25.086 --> 09:28.045
Adam Carrington.What, what's the...?

09:28.089 --> 09:30.613
Kirby, what exactly happened
in that cult?

09:30.657 --> 09:32.528
Did Joel
brainwash you

09:32.572 --> 09:34.225
into only liking crazy people?

09:34.269 --> 09:36.184
First of all, not a cult.

09:36.227 --> 09:37.620
Adam may not have
the best track record,

09:37.664 --> 09:39.622
but he did come
to save me from Synergy,

09:39.666 --> 09:42.712
and he's actually
super charming and fun.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.279
All I'm saying is,
this has the makings

09:44.322 --> 09:46.629
of a relationship disaster,
all right?

09:46.673 --> 09:49.414
Don't ignore the warning signs.

09:49.458 --> 09:50.938
If you feel that strongly
about it...

09:50.981 --> 09:52.548
Oh, yes, I do.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.332
And you're welcome.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.598
If you feel that
strongly about it,

09:58.641 --> 10:00.643
keep it a secret from you, too.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.558
Look who rolled back into town.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.081
I'd ask if Vanessa was with you,

10:04.125 --> 10:06.649
but I'm sure you're working
overtime to keep us apart.

10:06.693 --> 10:09.304
Don't be silly,
I'd never do that.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.262
Besides, I couldn't
if I wanted to.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.656
Once Jeff and Monica found out
Vanessa was my stepdaughter,

10:13.700 --> 10:15.571
I tossed out the blackmail
I had on you.

10:15.615 --> 10:19.183
Hmm, how generous.
I guess it doesn't matter.

10:19.227 --> 10:22.447
Vanessa wants nothing
to do with me.Oh? You spoke to her?

10:22.491 --> 10:25.102
We texted a lot when
she went back to New York,

10:25.146 --> 10:27.017
but then I mentioned
coming to visit,

10:27.061 --> 10:29.672
and things have been
radio silent ever since.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.500
I had no idea.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.067
Although that doesn't
surprise me.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.635
I saw her when I was in New
York. She has her own apartment.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.680
Even booked
a few nightclub gigs.

10:37.724 --> 10:40.683
I hate to say it,
but she's moving on.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.120
Yeah. Without me.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.948
I'm sorry, Michael. Truly.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.602
If it makes you feel any better,

10:46.646 --> 10:49.431
I haven't had the
best day either.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.476
Next round on me?

10:55.480 --> 10:59.528
Wow. This place has to have,
what, 15 bedrooms?

10:59.571 --> 11:02.009
Are you sure
you'll have enough space?

11:02.052 --> 11:04.011
No, it'll be tight,
but I'll manage.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.622
The important thing is
the history of happiness

11:06.666 --> 11:07.841
this house has.

11:07.884 --> 11:10.408
Happiness that I'm sure
will spill onto me.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.149
If they accept your offer.

11:12.193 --> 11:15.718
Oh, honey,
I'm not worried about that.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.460
Let's go, boys!

11:21.637 --> 11:23.030
You know, when making
an all-cash offer,

11:23.073 --> 11:25.902
you don't actually have
to have the cash with you.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.817
Well, I don't like
to take chances.

11:27.861 --> 11:30.428
And, look, the visual
is so impressive.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.039
JAX:
What's going on?

11:32.082 --> 11:33.693
What's happening here?

11:33.736 --> 11:35.869
You said the owner
wasn't accepting offers

11:35.912 --> 11:38.567
before the open house,
but nobody said

11:38.610 --> 11:40.743
I couldn't offer
at the open house.

11:40.787 --> 11:43.659
Fallon's very talented
in finding loopholes.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.269
Got it.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.837
And that jacket
looks great on you.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.709
Thanks. I wasn't
sure about it...

11:49.752 --> 11:51.711
Okay, listen, that's enough with
the special Queer Eyeepisode.

11:51.754 --> 11:52.668
I have a house to buy.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.235
I don't think you understand.

11:54.278 --> 11:56.803
Everyone looking to buy this
house is as rich as you are.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.239
You've got serious competition
in there.

11:58.282 --> 12:01.764
Oh, you just said
the magic words, Jaxon.

12:01.808 --> 12:04.462
Fallon Carrington
thrives on competition.

12:07.683 --> 12:10.686
It's actually just Jax.
No "on."

12:11.818 --> 12:14.734
Blake. What a lovely surprise.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.692
You told security
to let me in, Alexis.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.694
It can't be too surprising.True.

12:18.738 --> 12:22.785
So, no Jeff by your side,
feeding you grapes?

12:22.829 --> 12:25.005
He has actual companies to run.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.359
Yeah, I got to tell you,
I'm, I'm actually surprised

12:31.402 --> 12:32.795
you're still here at all.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.406
Well, I know this marriage
was just payment for you

12:35.450 --> 12:37.408
helping him try
to put me into prison.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.410
And when that plan
failed, I just assumed

12:39.454 --> 12:41.108
this magical romance
would fall apart.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.326
You're wrong.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.241
Jeff and I share
a love that is deep.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.243
Only thing you two share

12:46.287 --> 12:48.811
is a pathetic vendetta
against me.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.813
I know what you're up to
with C.A.

12:50.857 --> 12:51.901
Look,

12:51.945 --> 12:53.773
I don't know what his offer was,

12:53.816 --> 12:55.470
but I'll buy it
back with interest.

12:55.513 --> 12:59.169
And maybe if you help broker a
deal, you can get a commission.

12:59.213 --> 13:02.085
I mean, that's what you really
want anyway, right? Money?

13:02.129 --> 13:05.219
How sad is this, Blake?

13:06.568 --> 13:08.700
In the past, you would have
sent Fallon or Adam

13:08.744 --> 13:10.354
to do your dirty work.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.704
Clearly you've alienated
yourself from the entire family

13:12.748 --> 13:16.273
'cause here you are,
groveling all alone.

13:16.317 --> 13:17.709
I'm hardly groveling.

13:17.753 --> 13:18.972
I understand, though.

13:19.015 --> 13:21.801
You alienated me
from my family for years.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.759
Only I didn't have a choice.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.718
You did this to yourself.

13:27.763 --> 13:30.679
You made a tactical error,

13:30.722 --> 13:33.421
aligning your forces with Jeff.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.945
Colbys always lose
to Carringtons.

13:35.989 --> 13:38.643
You'll be nothing
but a casualty of war.

13:41.472 --> 13:44.998
Lot of potential buyers,
Fallon.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.434
What exactly
are you gonna do?

13:46.477 --> 13:48.131
You'll see.

13:48.175 --> 13:51.743
I just have to thin out
the competition a little.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.745
I hear one of those floozies

13:53.789 --> 13:55.835
from The Real Housewives
owns this place.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.533
I swear I can smell the stench

13:58.576 --> 14:02.232
of desperation and spray tan.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.452
Oh, you know they filmed
a Marvel movie here.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.628
But I'm sure the sci-fi geeks
only show up for, you know,

14:06.671 --> 14:08.456
Dragon Con, Comic-Con.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.588
Pretty much all the Cons.

14:12.808 --> 14:16.203
Double homicide, right here.

14:16.246 --> 14:20.076
Rumor has it there's still blood
under the floorboards.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.817
I heard there was
a minor rodent infestation.

14:21.861 --> 14:22.949
What?

14:22.992 --> 14:24.864
I'm sure they won't come back.Rodents?

14:24.907 --> 14:26.474
Porn house.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.563
Now I'll just turn on
the Carrington charm

14:28.606 --> 14:30.260
with the unsuspecting owner,

14:30.304 --> 14:32.741
and the place will be mine.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.874
Wait, who are these

14:34.917 --> 14:36.310
Town & Country-looking
newcomers, and why

14:36.353 --> 14:38.355
are they hugging
that old lady?

14:38.399 --> 14:40.357
Because that old lady

14:40.401 --> 14:42.533
is Esther Winslow, the owner.

14:42.577 --> 14:47.495
She must know that family...
and love them.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.279
You have got to
be kidding me.

14:49.323 --> 14:52.195
Well, I guess I'll just have
to destroy a family of four.

14:52.239 --> 14:53.544
Whoa.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.677
You know those kids
are, like, six years old.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.506
All is fair in love
and real estate.

15:04.555 --> 15:05.643
Well, it's just not the same
here without you.

15:05.687 --> 15:06.731
I don't understand why you had

15:06.775 --> 15:08.081
to go to Mexico
in the first place.

15:08.124 --> 15:10.561
I'll be home before you know it.
Promise.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.563
So how's the Carrington Atlantic
sale going?

15:12.607 --> 15:15.523
It's not.
Jeff Colby made an offer first.

15:15.566 --> 15:18.178
He and Alexis think
this is the best way to hurt me.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.571
You know, Fallon

15:20.615 --> 15:22.965
has a good relationship
with Jeff.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.314
I know things are tense
between you two,

15:24.358 --> 15:26.447
but maybe she would
talk to him for you.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.710
Yeah, I'm not sure about that.

15:28.753 --> 15:32.453
If nothing else, it gives you
a reason to call her.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.411
I know how much
you miss her, Blake.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.326
Don't let your pride
stand in the way.

15:38.285 --> 15:40.896
The hospital administrator said
that they have a spot for me,

15:40.940 --> 15:42.767
so I could be practicing
medicine again in no time.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.508
That's fantastic.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.380
And just think, with Jeff
buying a pharmaceutical company,

15:46.423 --> 15:47.816
both of the men

15:47.859 --> 15:49.861
in my life will be
working in medicine.

15:49.905 --> 15:52.473
Jeff's buying
a pharmaceutical company? Why?

15:53.561 --> 15:55.911
It's a sound investment.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.131
Everyone needs medicine, right?

15:58.174 --> 15:59.436
Well,

15:59.480 --> 16:02.222
I should take my mail
and be going.

16:02.265 --> 16:06.182
Oh. This is for you.

16:06.226 --> 16:07.444
Hmm.

16:09.403 --> 16:10.578
Huh.

16:10.621 --> 16:13.407
That's weird. It's an invitation

16:13.450 --> 16:16.192
to a Valentine's Day party
at La Mirage.

16:16.236 --> 16:17.454
From whom?

16:17.498 --> 16:20.109
Doesn't say.
It's from a "secret admirer."

16:20.153 --> 16:23.243
How wonderfully mysterious.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.418
I do hope you'll go.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.115
Practicing medicine
is great,

16:26.159 --> 16:29.510
but we can't neglect
our personal lives.

16:29.553 --> 16:32.687
I think I will go, Mother,
because I have

16:32.730 --> 16:34.297
a pretty good idea
who invited me.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.559
MICHAEL :
And I watch

16:35.603 --> 16:39.520
a $1,500 bottle of champagne

16:39.563 --> 16:42.262
fly out of Blake's hands
and shatter.

16:42.305 --> 16:45.830
The poor bastard
never got to take a sip.

16:45.874 --> 16:49.095
I haven't laughed
this much in years.

16:49.138 --> 16:53.403
Vanessa is crazy
to let you go.

16:53.447 --> 16:56.537
Because you, sir,
are an amazing man.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.582
Why, thank you, kind lady.

16:58.626 --> 17:03.500
And you are a lot more fun
when you're not blackmailing me.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.720
Okay.

17:05.763 --> 17:10.551
This one is to celebrate
our single status.

17:10.594 --> 17:13.467
Because who needs a plus-one

17:13.510 --> 17:17.123
when we have top-shelf
tequila to keep us company?

17:17.166 --> 17:18.559
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.952
To being single.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.091
I should probably call a car.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.658
No, no, no, wait.
You can't leave.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.529
The party's just
getting started.

17:32.573 --> 17:35.054
Besides, who do you have
to go home to, anyway?

17:35.097 --> 17:37.360
You are right about that.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.536
I feel your pain, Michael.

17:39.580 --> 17:44.280
But you don't have to be alone
tonight if you don't want to be.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.954
LIAM:
Hey. Are you ready?

18:05.997 --> 18:07.738
The restaurant we're going to
is supposed to be amazing,

18:07.782 --> 18:09.349
and I'm starving.No time for dinner.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.873
I have to pick out
a gift for Mrs. Winslow.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.876
Do you think Esther would like
an early Easter basket,

18:14.919 --> 18:16.443
maybe filled with FabergÃ© eggs?

18:16.486 --> 18:17.574
Are you kidding?

18:17.618 --> 18:18.836
You're right.
Go more traditional.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.491
How about an original Picasso?

18:21.535 --> 18:23.711
I'll see if I can pull one
from the Carrington vault.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.582
Well, have you considered
doing something more personal?

18:25.626 --> 18:26.844
Huh?I meant like

18:26.888 --> 18:28.324
writing a letter, Fallon.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.674
Okay? Tell this woman what
this house means to you.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.416
All right? What it
meant to you as a kid.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.026
Hmm. Yes.

18:35.070 --> 18:36.811
I like it. I like it.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.726
Lean in to the whole

18:38.769 --> 18:40.815
grandmother thing,
really play up the nostalgia.

18:40.858 --> 18:44.123
You know what? Attach it to a
box of hard candies and I'm in.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.907
There you go.This won't take long.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.083
I will meet you
at the restaurant.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.259
Oh. Hi.

18:50.303 --> 18:51.521
Leaving so soon?

18:51.565 --> 18:53.306
We're late for dinner.
Don't want to lose

18:53.349 --> 18:55.656
our reservation.

18:55.699 --> 18:56.700
JAX:
So, I have some news.

18:56.744 --> 18:58.093
No, no, no, no. Not now.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.181
I am in the zone.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.530
You may need to get
out of the zone.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.837
I just got off the phone
with Winslow's broker,

19:02.880 --> 19:04.752
and there's been a twist.

19:04.795 --> 19:05.666
Turns out,
the old lady

19:05.709 --> 19:07.798
only wants to sell to a family.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.713
What?
I know.

19:09.757 --> 19:10.714
I guess she was raised
in that house

19:10.758 --> 19:12.107
and raised her own family there,

19:12.151 --> 19:14.544
wants the tradition to continue,
blah, blah, blah.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.720
I can't believe it.
This is discrimination.

19:16.764 --> 19:19.027
We should call the ACLU.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.028
I say we move on.

19:21.072 --> 19:22.813
No.

19:22.857 --> 19:25.207
I'm not giving up.

19:25.251 --> 19:26.774
Not yet.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.604
Dominique.

19:30.647 --> 19:31.735
Thank you for coming.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.650
Though you certainly
took your time.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.783
Sorry I missed your call,
but I was tied up at the time.

19:35.826 --> 19:39.613
So, what did I do to deserve
a summons from Blake Carrington?

19:39.656 --> 19:42.398
Absolutely nothing.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.444
Yet.

19:44.487 --> 19:45.575
Hmm.

19:45.619 --> 19:46.576
Thought I'd mix things up
for a change.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.231
I need a favor from you.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.712
Of course,
I'll pay handsomely.

19:51.755 --> 19:53.583
And what exactly does
this favor entail?

19:53.627 --> 19:54.889
Simple.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.760
You have access to Jeff's house.
I need inside.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.066
Specifically his office.

19:58.109 --> 19:59.720
He's trying to buy
Carrington Atlantic,

19:59.763 --> 20:02.201
and I need to find out
whatever I can about his plan.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.159
So...

20:04.203 --> 20:07.162
can I count on you? Sis?

20:07.206 --> 20:10.426
Jeff and Alexis have a meeting
tomorrow afternoon,

20:10.470 --> 20:11.906
so they'll be gone.

20:11.949 --> 20:14.387
I can meet you there then
and get you past security.

20:14.430 --> 20:15.692
That's perfect.However,

20:15.736 --> 20:17.259
if I do this, I'm going to want

20:17.303 --> 20:20.044
something more than money
in return.

20:21.437 --> 20:22.699
Much more.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.751
Good news. I just talked to Jax.

20:30.794 --> 20:33.449
The letter to Mrs. Winslow
worked. I am back in the game.

20:33.493 --> 20:35.495
See? I told you.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.279
Sometimes it just takes a
personal touch with people.

20:37.323 --> 20:38.454
Right. A personal touch,

20:38.498 --> 20:40.674
with just a tiny bit
of embellishment.

20:41.718 --> 20:42.980
How tiny?

20:43.024 --> 20:44.982
Oh, it's really not a big deal.

20:45.026 --> 20:47.637
Mrs. Winslow just
wants to meet me.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.378
And my husband and my children.

20:49.422 --> 20:50.727
Why would you do that?

20:50.771 --> 20:52.773
Well, she said she wanted
to sell to a family.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.035
So you just invented one?

20:54.078 --> 20:55.515
I panicked. Okay?

20:55.558 --> 20:57.647
I didn't think she would
actually want to meet everybody.

20:57.691 --> 20:59.693
Anyway, we're all invited
over there tonight.

20:59.736 --> 21:01.825
All of who?

21:01.869 --> 21:02.913
You don't actually
have children.

21:02.957 --> 21:04.611
Fallon, we're not
even married.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.743
Well...
technicalities.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.702
Look, if you just want to
check off the homeowner box,

21:08.745 --> 21:10.747
there are other
places you can buy.

21:11.748 --> 21:14.011
Why is this house
so important?

21:14.055 --> 21:15.535
Because it just is.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.798
Look, I know
it sounds weird,

21:17.841 --> 21:19.713
but this house saved me
when I was a kid.

21:19.756 --> 21:22.324
When Alexis and Blake
would be fighting,

21:22.368 --> 21:25.153
I would just sneak over there,
and I would peak in the window,

21:25.196 --> 21:27.764
just to get an idea
of what a happy family was like.

21:27.808 --> 21:30.158
And they ate dinner together
and they played charades

21:30.201 --> 21:32.726
and had movie nights,
and... I don't know.

21:32.769 --> 21:36.120
Seeing a real family
made me realize

21:36.164 --> 21:38.558
that things could be different.
Or better.

21:39.602 --> 21:41.256
I know it sounds crazy.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.911
No, it doesn't
sound crazy.

21:43.954 --> 21:47.131
Crazy is accepting an invitation
for a family you don't have.

21:47.175 --> 21:49.656
You have to tell
Mrs. Winslow the truth.

21:49.699 --> 21:50.918
All right, who knows,
maybe she'll appreciate

21:50.961 --> 21:52.006
the honesty, and you'll
still get the place.

21:52.049 --> 21:55.270
You're right.
I should go talk to her.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.751
But you're
coming with me.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.711
You could have removed
the spare tire

22:01.755 --> 22:03.409
before forcing me
in the trunk.

22:03.452 --> 22:06.150
Just be glad I got you
past the gate.

22:06.194 --> 22:07.935
I told Jeff's head of security

22:07.978 --> 22:10.067
that I was going to pick up
some things I left in my room.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.679
Well, with any luck,
this won't take me long.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.202
I'll stand watch outside.

22:27.607 --> 22:29.173
Excuse me, is
there a problem?

22:29.217 --> 22:30.740
Ms. Deveraux, the door alarm
on Mr. Colby's office

22:30.784 --> 22:32.873
just went off.DOMINIQUE:
Oh. I'm sorry.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.744
That was me. I went in
to get a bottle

22:34.788 --> 22:36.398
of champagne off Jeff's bar.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.052
No harm, no foul.I see.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.662
Well, still, no one's
allowed in there,

22:39.706 --> 22:41.055
so I'll have
to let Mr. Colby know

22:41.098 --> 22:43.971
when he returns.You're certainly devoted.

22:44.014 --> 22:46.930
Duane, is it?

22:46.974 --> 22:47.888
But here's the
thing, Duane.

22:47.931 --> 22:49.455
I'd hate to
call my son

22:49.498 --> 22:51.892
and tell him that in fact
you were the one in his office,

22:51.935 --> 22:54.416
rifling through his desk,
drinking from his bar,

22:54.460 --> 22:56.244
reeking of alcohol...He wouldn't believe that.

22:57.811 --> 22:59.595
I think he might.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.946
Make it quick, all right?

23:02.990 --> 23:05.035
Crazy...

23:17.961 --> 23:19.136
What's going on?

23:19.180 --> 23:21.443
I followed Jeff and Alexis
as instructed.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.358
They had some sort of a meeting
at Chlorcyte Health.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.359
BLAKE:
Chlorcyte?

23:24.403 --> 23:25.839
The big pharma company?

23:25.882 --> 23:27.188
Why would they be having
a meeting there?

23:27.231 --> 23:28.798
Well, your guess
is as good as mine.

23:28.842 --> 23:31.235
But they're done now
and they're leaving.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.455
You should vacate the premises.

23:46.642 --> 23:47.948
Wow.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.080
Fun idea for a party, huh?

23:50.124 --> 23:51.386
You're here.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.953
I mean, you're here.

23:52.996 --> 23:56.347
So, did you, uh, send an
invite or receive one?Recipient.

23:56.391 --> 23:57.697
And very flattered.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.916
Really?

23:59.960 --> 24:02.092
Do you feel the same way
about your admirer?

24:02.136 --> 24:03.790
I think I do.

24:03.833 --> 24:04.921
I mean, I haven't seen Nadia

24:04.965 --> 24:07.184
in a while, but we've texted
a few times.

24:08.359 --> 24:09.317
Nadia?

24:09.360 --> 24:10.536
Wait, you mean
your nurse?

24:10.579 --> 24:12.451
I know she feels bad
about how things ended,

24:12.494 --> 24:15.062
and I think this is her way
of trying to reach out.

24:15.105 --> 24:16.237
Hoping to reconnect,
you know?

24:16.280 --> 24:18.805
Yeah. Yeah.

24:18.848 --> 24:21.068
I bet you're right.

24:21.111 --> 24:22.896
I'm sure she'll
be here soon.Thanks.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.419
I-I'm gonna go look for her.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.595
KIRBY:
Okay.

24:26.639 --> 24:27.901
I'll be here.

24:27.944 --> 24:29.511
Feeling like a moron.

24:30.556 --> 24:31.861
FALLON:
Hi!

24:31.905 --> 24:34.081
LIAM:
Fallon?

24:34.124 --> 24:35.038
Why are you
driving a minivan?

24:35.082 --> 24:36.953
And what are
you wearing?Oh.

24:36.997 --> 24:40.522
I had no idea how comfortable
polyblend sweaters were.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.002
Hmm.I decided

24:42.045 --> 24:44.047
that the truth just wasn't
the best way to play this.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.658
: So you
think that showing up

24:45.701 --> 24:47.529
in a minivan dressed
as a soccer mom's

24:47.573 --> 24:49.009
gonna convince her
you have a family?

24:49.052 --> 24:51.664
Of course not.
But you and the two kids will.

24:51.707 --> 24:52.882
What two ki...?

24:52.926 --> 24:55.450
Oh, my God, what
did you do?

24:55.494 --> 24:56.712
Did you buy two kids
from someone?

24:56.756 --> 24:58.671
What? No.
Don't be ridiculous.

24:58.714 --> 24:59.802
I'm renting them.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.151
They're Tony
the gardener's kids,

25:01.195 --> 25:03.502
and let's just say I made
a very generous donation

25:03.545 --> 25:04.720
to their college fund.
Oh!

25:04.764 --> 25:07.549
Don't forget, kids.
You get 20 bucks

25:07.593 --> 25:09.072
for every time
you call me Mommy.

25:09.116 --> 25:10.204
Okay?

25:10.247 --> 25:11.814
This is never
gonna work.

25:11.858 --> 25:12.989
Oh, yeah, it will.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.077
They could totally pass
as our kids.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.688
Ourkids?Yeah.

25:15.731 --> 25:18.473
I thought I was coming for moral
support, not child support.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.780
You're gonna lie to this woman
just so you can buy her house?

25:20.823 --> 25:22.346
Well, only until
escrow closes.

25:22.390 --> 25:25.219
I'm not gonna be a part of this.Liam, please.

25:25.262 --> 25:26.873
You know how much getting
this house means to me.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.309
I just hate lying.

25:28.352 --> 25:30.050
And you won't have to, okay?
I promise.

25:30.093 --> 25:32.792
Mrs. Winslow will just assume
that you're the father.

25:32.835 --> 25:34.794
And I, of course,
am the very loving mother.

25:34.837 --> 25:36.535
Mommy!Save it.

25:36.578 --> 25:37.840
I told you, it only counts

25:37.884 --> 25:40.016
when you're in front
of the old woman.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.457
Hey.Hey.

25:46.501 --> 25:47.633
You find Nadia?

25:47.676 --> 25:49.765
Not yet.
I'm sure she'll be here soon.

25:49.809 --> 25:51.593
What about you?
Did you send an invite

25:51.637 --> 25:53.203
or receive one?

25:53.247 --> 25:56.032
Sent, but he didn't
show up.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.817
Well, he's an idiot.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.949
And it's still early.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.516
True.

26:03.649 --> 26:04.867
Do you want to dance?

26:04.911 --> 26:06.521
While you're waiting
for Nadia?

26:06.565 --> 26:08.697
Sure.
Yeah, let's do it.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.054
Yeah-- okay.

26:19.752 --> 26:20.970
ADAM:
Oh, I see,

26:21.014 --> 26:22.319
you like to lead.

26:22.363 --> 26:23.320
Well,

26:23.364 --> 26:24.800
I sort of have two left feet.

26:24.844 --> 26:27.324
But on the plus side,
that means I'm really good

26:27.368 --> 26:30.066
at dancing
in circles.Right.

26:30.110 --> 26:31.851
Hey, what's that?

26:32.939 --> 26:34.549
Oh.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.900
You take a heart and put it on
when you've met your admirer.

26:37.944 --> 26:39.598
âª Overgrown

26:40.686 --> 26:43.819
âª Scales lack luster

26:43.863 --> 26:46.822
âª A howl's all I can muster...

26:48.955 --> 26:51.610
Might as well.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.873
Soon as Nadia arrives, my
heart will be spoken for.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.615
Look, Adam, I should tell you...

26:56.658 --> 26:57.790
Hey, I'm gonna go
check the lobby.

26:57.833 --> 26:58.834
She might be in there.

26:58.878 --> 27:00.227
Will you excuse me
for a moment?

27:00.270 --> 27:01.794
I'll, I'll be right back.

27:04.927 --> 27:08.757
Hey there.Vanessa, what are you...?

27:11.673 --> 27:14.023
I've been missing you.

27:14.067 --> 27:15.851
Really?

27:15.895 --> 27:17.984
You sound so surprised.No, it's just

27:18.027 --> 27:20.464
that when you stopped
responding to my texts, I...

27:20.508 --> 27:21.596
Me?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.380
You stopped answering
my text messages.

27:23.424 --> 27:24.817
So I thought
you were upset.

27:24.860 --> 27:27.036
Which you had
every right to be.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.472
But it doesn't
matter now.

27:28.516 --> 27:31.040
Because I'm
moving back.To Atlanta?

27:31.084 --> 27:32.912
Mm-hmm.What about New York?

27:32.955 --> 27:35.044
You-you found a place,
you're booking gigs...

27:35.088 --> 27:37.046
Who told you that?

27:37.090 --> 27:41.921
It must have been Jeff
when he talked to Monica.

27:41.964 --> 27:44.010
But it sounds like
your music career

27:44.053 --> 27:46.012
has really taken off.It is.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.797
But I realized
I can pursue my music here

27:48.841 --> 27:50.103
just as easily as I can
in New York.

27:50.146 --> 27:54.107
What I couldn't pursue
is you.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.720
I've missed you, too.

27:58.764 --> 28:01.723
Is there any chance
we can pick up

28:01.767 --> 28:02.898
where we left off?

28:02.942 --> 28:05.684
Yeah. I'd like that.

28:15.302 --> 28:16.259
Make mine extra dirty, please.

28:16.303 --> 28:17.826
Yeah, yeah, olive juice

28:17.870 --> 28:19.088
with a splash of vodka.

28:19.132 --> 28:20.220
I got you.

28:20.263 --> 28:22.309
This just came
for you, Mrs. Colby.

28:22.352 --> 28:23.963
Thank you.

28:24.006 --> 28:25.442
Well, who's that from?

28:25.486 --> 28:27.706
Well, it's on
Carrington stationery.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.796
It's from Blake.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.928
Inviting us to dinner,

28:32.972 --> 28:36.149
suggesting that
we celebrate together.

28:36.192 --> 28:38.194
Do you have any idea
what he's talking about?

28:42.198 --> 28:43.591
It's my lawyer.

28:43.634 --> 28:44.984
Hello.

28:45.027 --> 28:47.116
Wait, what?

28:48.596 --> 28:50.598
That bastard.

28:59.215 --> 29:01.043
SAM:
Adam?

29:01.087 --> 29:02.131
What are you doing here?

29:02.175 --> 29:03.437
I was invited.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.831
That girl never listens.

29:05.874 --> 29:07.702
Excuse me?Look,

29:07.746 --> 29:09.356
I don't know what Kirby
sees in you.

29:09.399 --> 29:11.184
The rest of us see
some sort of

29:11.227 --> 29:12.272
"Christian Bale,
American Psycho,

29:12.315 --> 29:13.621
only weirder" thing.

29:14.709 --> 29:17.146
All right? But you better
not hurt her.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.366
Kirby? What-what are you
talking about? I...

29:19.409 --> 29:22.064
Hey! Was she out here?

29:24.719 --> 29:27.548
No... but she wouldn't
be, would she?

29:27.591 --> 29:30.769
Because yousent me
the invitation.

29:30.812 --> 29:33.293
I'm gonna...

29:33.336 --> 29:36.078
Um, Happy Valentine's.

29:36.122 --> 29:37.819
I can explain?

29:37.863 --> 29:39.168
Is this some kind of sick joke?

29:39.212 --> 29:40.387
Are you working with Nadia
to set me up again?

29:40.430 --> 29:41.823
What? No, I would never do that.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.173
Then, then why?
Wh-Why, why would you do this?

29:44.217 --> 29:46.175
Because I like you, okay?

29:46.219 --> 29:47.873
You have a funny way
of showing it, all right?

29:47.916 --> 29:49.962
You could have told me
that you sent me the invite

29:50.005 --> 29:51.920
when you first got here.
Why didn't you?

29:51.964 --> 29:53.182
Because clearly
I was the farthest thing

29:53.226 --> 29:54.793
from your mind,
and I was too embarrassed

29:54.836 --> 29:55.924
to tell you the truth.

29:55.968 --> 29:57.099
So you chose to lie
to me instead?

29:57.143 --> 29:59.145
All night long.

29:59.188 --> 30:01.408
You made a fool of me,
searching for someone

30:01.451 --> 30:02.801
who is never showing up.

30:04.890 --> 30:07.806
If that's you liking me,
I'd, I'd rather you didn't.

30:10.939 --> 30:13.724
You have such
a lovely home, Esther.

30:13.768 --> 30:15.857
And you have a
lovely family, dear.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.642
Your children
are adorable.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.775
Oh, Mommy's perfect
little angels.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.037
I love you, Mommy.

30:22.081 --> 30:23.604
Aw.

30:23.647 --> 30:26.302
It warms my heart to know
that these walls could be filled

30:26.346 --> 30:28.478
with such a loving family.

30:28.522 --> 30:30.480
Well, let me
heat up my tea,

30:30.524 --> 30:32.308
and I'll show you
the rest of the house.

30:32.352 --> 30:34.093
Okay, Esther.

30:36.051 --> 30:38.445
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

30:38.488 --> 30:41.970
Esther loves my family.
This place is mine.

30:42.014 --> 30:44.973
Great. Can we wrap
this up, please?

30:45.017 --> 30:46.453
Yeah, relax, relax.

30:46.496 --> 30:48.803
I know you hate lying,
but think of it less as lying

30:48.847 --> 30:51.893
and more as a sneak peek
into your future.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.982
This is exactly how
I always imagined it:

30:54.026 --> 30:57.856
a beautiful home,
husband, children...

30:57.899 --> 31:00.293
Excuse me?Well, no, I mean, not
these children, obviously.

31:00.336 --> 31:01.990
The younger one
has an overbite.

31:02.034 --> 31:03.862
Did you forget that this whole
family charade thing

31:03.905 --> 31:05.602
was just so
you could get the house?

31:05.646 --> 31:06.865
It was supposed to be
a means to an end,

31:06.908 --> 31:08.692
not the end itself.I'm sorry,

31:08.736 --> 31:10.825
is there something wrong
with this being our future?

31:10.869 --> 31:12.914
This was supposed to be
a quick stop on your journey,

31:12.958 --> 31:14.524
not the final
destination.

31:14.568 --> 31:18.050
But if-if you had bothered to
even talk to me for one second,

31:18.093 --> 31:20.008
you would know that
this isn't what I want!

31:20.052 --> 31:22.663
Oh, really?
Well, exactly what part

31:22.706 --> 31:23.969
of my future don't you like?

31:24.012 --> 31:26.928
Your future has kids.
Mine doesn't!

31:29.017 --> 31:29.931
Bye-bye.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.368
I'm sorry.

31:32.412 --> 31:33.587
It was an accident.

31:33.630 --> 31:34.893
He was wearing a
heart on his shirt.

31:34.936 --> 31:36.851
I thought you two had
already matched up.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.766
No, he thought
Nadia invited him.

31:38.809 --> 31:39.985
The cuckoo
nurse that

31:40.028 --> 31:41.900
Fallon was paying to like him?Yes.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.466
Look, I'm sorry
for how it all went down,

31:43.510 --> 31:44.946
but I'm not sorry
it ended, okay?

31:44.990 --> 31:47.470
I told you, dating him
is a huge mistake.

31:47.514 --> 31:48.819
I'm a grown woman.

31:48.863 --> 31:50.952
Let me make my own mistakes.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.693
I did-- you joined a cult,
remember?

31:52.736 --> 31:53.607
It wasn't a cult!

31:53.650 --> 31:54.956
I don't want you to get hurt.

31:55.000 --> 31:55.914
What makes you think
I'm gonna get hurt?

31:55.957 --> 31:58.046
Because I got hurt!

31:59.308 --> 32:02.311
Fletcher is married.

32:02.355 --> 32:04.923
He was lying to me
the whole time we dated.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.316
I ignored the warning signs,
and I don't want you

32:07.360 --> 32:09.449
to make the same mistake.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.934
I'm sorry Fletcher hurt you.

32:18.849 --> 32:21.765
But that doesn't mean
that Adam's gonna hurt me.

32:21.809 --> 32:23.724
Kirby...

32:23.767 --> 32:24.725
I'm following my heart.

32:24.768 --> 32:25.987
I don't know
where it's taking me,

32:26.031 --> 32:28.903
but it feels like
the right way to go.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.950
âª Next to you

32:31.993 --> 32:34.865
âª No matter what you do

32:34.909 --> 32:36.041
âª Next to you

32:36.084 --> 32:39.392
âª No matter what you do

32:39.435 --> 32:41.437
âª Next to you.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.483
Oh, this all looks delicious.

32:43.526 --> 32:45.833
Mrs. Gunnerson has
outdone herself again.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.968
Sounds like we have company.

32:50.011 --> 32:53.014
Oh, good. You got
my invitation.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.668
I was worried that
you wouldn't show.

32:54.711 --> 32:55.974
You son of a bitch.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.801
You getting in the
pharmaceutical business now?

32:57.845 --> 32:59.412
Heard you bought Chlorcyte.

32:59.455 --> 33:00.804
You heard correctly.

33:00.848 --> 33:03.024
You know damn well
Jeff was buying that company.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.721
You have no reason
to outbid him for it.

33:04.765 --> 33:06.375
No, no, I have
every reason.

33:06.419 --> 33:10.336
You see, I figured out that your
second-rate husband is sick.

33:10.379 --> 33:12.207
Uh, neurotoxicity, is it?

33:12.251 --> 33:15.776
And oddly enough,
Chlorcyte is researching

33:15.819 --> 33:17.908
a drug to cure just that.

33:17.952 --> 33:20.520
Research that I have put
a halt to.

33:20.563 --> 33:22.043
What do you want?

33:22.087 --> 33:23.523
Well, please
join me.

33:23.566 --> 33:26.091
I'm sure that we could
reach some sort of deal.

33:26.134 --> 33:29.007
Like, say, I give
you Chlorcyte

33:29.050 --> 33:30.443
in exchange for C.A.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.968
Yeah, it belongs
to me.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.056
And I want it back.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.231
We don't even own it yet.

33:36.275 --> 33:37.232
Yeah, but you will.

33:37.276 --> 33:40.540
So, do we have a deal?

33:40.583 --> 33:41.802
Not interested.

33:42.977 --> 33:44.457
Well, I'm guessing

33:44.500 --> 33:47.112
that you will change
your mind soon enough.

33:47.155 --> 33:50.028
I mean, how bad are
the symptoms anyway?

33:50.071 --> 33:52.073
You look a little shaky.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.814
You think this is over?

33:55.424 --> 33:58.340
See, there are plenty of other
pharma companies I can buy.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.473
But there's only one C.A.

34:00.516 --> 34:01.865
And it will be mine.

34:01.909 --> 34:03.998
We'll see.

34:07.306 --> 34:09.134
Here we are.

34:09.177 --> 34:10.874
A little treat for everyone.

34:10.918 --> 34:13.834
Do you like
freshly baked cookies?

34:13.877 --> 34:16.445
Well, I think we do,
but one should never assume.

34:16.489 --> 34:18.882
Do we like cookies, honey?

34:18.926 --> 34:21.102
As a matter of fact,
I do like a good cookie.

34:21.146 --> 34:23.104
Yes, thank you
for asking!

34:23.148 --> 34:24.105
Wow.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.715
Is everything okay?

34:25.759 --> 34:28.066
Oh, everything is
just fine, Esther.

34:28.109 --> 34:29.893
I just, I recently
found out that

34:29.937 --> 34:33.114
my husband doesn't
want... trees

34:33.158 --> 34:34.681
nearby.

34:34.724 --> 34:37.118
I wasn't aware that my wife
wanted trees in her life.

34:37.162 --> 34:40.078
You see, they do take
a lot of time and care.

34:40.121 --> 34:43.777
Okay, I am more than capable
of taking care of a tree.

34:43.820 --> 34:45.344
Thank you very much.

34:45.387 --> 34:47.215
I mean, I might need a little
help from a few gardeners.

34:47.259 --> 34:49.130
Maybe even a night gardener.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.653
I have an excellent gardener,

34:50.697 --> 34:53.047
but I don't think
he works at night.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.701
Well, see, the problem really
isn't the trees, Esther.

34:54.744 --> 34:58.183
It's more of the assumption
that we both wanted trees.

34:58.226 --> 34:59.314
Why wouldn't I want trees?

34:59.358 --> 35:02.143
Everybody wants trees!

35:02.187 --> 35:03.971
Can we go now? I want
to go play Rocket League!

35:04.014 --> 35:06.887
Yeah, and I want my money
for calling you "Mommy."

35:06.930 --> 35:09.194
FALLON:
What?

35:09.237 --> 35:10.499
She's so funny.

35:10.543 --> 35:13.415
Sweetie, I don't have
any money for you.

35:13.459 --> 35:15.025
My daddy says
you're rich.

35:15.069 --> 35:16.244
Her daddy?

35:16.288 --> 35:17.158
Isn't Liam their father?

35:17.202 --> 35:18.638
Uh...

35:18.681 --> 35:21.162
Um... stepfather.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.163
You're divorced?

35:22.207 --> 35:23.947
My first husband died.

35:23.991 --> 35:26.036
In the war.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.560
BETSY:
I want to go home.

35:27.603 --> 35:29.039
Yeah, can we go?
I want to get paid.I want to leave!

35:29.083 --> 35:31.129
Okay, all right!
It's bedtime, kids.

35:31.172 --> 35:33.653
Why don't you go to the car, and
Daddy and I'll meet you there?

35:33.696 --> 35:35.829
Right, send the kids
outside alone

35:35.872 --> 35:37.874
in the dark--
mother of the year.

35:37.918 --> 35:39.180
You know what?
I think I've had

35:39.224 --> 35:41.139
about enough
of Daddy's snide comments.

35:41.182 --> 35:42.792
Oh, you've had enough?Yeah.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.403
I didn't want to be dragged into
this in the first place, Fallon.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.187
I told you I hate lying...

35:46.231 --> 35:47.667
Would you mind
explaining to me...?

35:47.710 --> 35:49.364
I hate you,
I want my real mommy...Can we just go?

35:49.408 --> 35:50.713
I don't want
to do this, Fallon.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.062
Everybody, shut up!

35:56.893 --> 35:58.982
I think we're
done here.

35:59.026 --> 36:01.202
Yeah. Hey, kids,
let's go.

36:05.815 --> 36:07.339
So, you were saying this house

36:07.382 --> 36:10.864
gets a lot
of south-facing light?

36:10.907 --> 36:12.126
Get the hell

36:12.170 --> 36:14.215
out of my house,
you crazy bitch.

36:20.613 --> 36:21.570
Michael, what's wrong?

36:21.614 --> 36:22.615
Vanessa's back in town.

36:22.658 --> 36:23.616
To stay.

36:23.659 --> 36:25.487
What? Since when?

36:25.531 --> 36:27.097
Since today.

36:27.141 --> 36:29.187
She wants to start dating again.

36:29.230 --> 36:31.493
Which is great.

36:31.537 --> 36:33.016
But if she ever
found out about us,

36:33.060 --> 36:34.061
about what we did...

36:34.104 --> 36:36.106
Michael, relax.

36:36.150 --> 36:38.587
Last night can be
our little secret.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.589
A drunken moment
of weakness

36:40.633 --> 36:41.764
on both our parts.

36:41.808 --> 36:42.809
That's all.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.724
So, this stays between us?

36:44.767 --> 36:46.204
Of course.

36:46.247 --> 36:51.121
I want you and Vanessa
to be happy... truly.

36:51.165 --> 36:52.601
Thank you.

37:02.611 --> 37:05.745
Hi, sweetheart, it's Mom.

37:05.788 --> 37:08.748
Did you get back
to Atlanta safely?

37:08.791 --> 37:10.445
Good.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.447
Get some rest.

37:12.491 --> 37:15.233
We'll talk tomorrow.

37:25.547 --> 37:27.723
Hi.

37:27.767 --> 37:29.943
Look, I'm really sorry.

37:29.986 --> 37:33.120
I should have been honest
with my feelings from the start.

37:33.163 --> 37:35.340
You have every reason
to be mad at me.

37:35.383 --> 37:37.385
I'm not mad
at you, Kirby.

37:39.213 --> 37:41.302
I'm mad at myself.

37:41.346 --> 37:43.304
For not letting
go of Nadia.

37:43.348 --> 37:44.740
I gave her my trust.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.786
And she destroyed that trust.

37:48.788 --> 37:51.486
I mean, she just got away
with it.

37:51.530 --> 37:54.489
She never had to pay
for all those lies.

38:21.516 --> 38:23.866
Wait, wait, wait.

38:23.910 --> 38:25.303
Is this a bad idea?

38:25.346 --> 38:28.175
I'm in the mood for a bad idea.

38:33.789 --> 38:35.835
Didn't expect
to find you here.

38:35.878 --> 38:40.187
Certainly not after
my epic mommy meltdown.

38:41.406 --> 38:44.496
Yeah, I sort of surprised
myself.

38:44.539 --> 38:46.715
Fallon, I had
to find out what...

38:46.759 --> 38:50.502
What brought all this on?

38:50.545 --> 38:53.983
I mean, your mind was suddenly
15 years down the road.

38:54.027 --> 38:56.638
Moving out of the manor.

38:56.682 --> 38:59.380
I think it made me
reexamine my life and...

38:59.424 --> 39:03.384
made me think about what
I wanted my life to be, and...

39:03.428 --> 39:04.646
I thought it was
about the house,

39:04.690 --> 39:07.083
but... it wasn't.

39:07.127 --> 39:09.172
It was more about

39:09.216 --> 39:10.391
what the house represented.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.741
And I decided
I liked that future.

39:12.785 --> 39:15.048
Well, Fallon,
that's the problem.

39:15.091 --> 39:16.354
You.

39:16.397 --> 39:18.138
Youdecided.

39:19.574 --> 39:21.750
You make all the decisions
in our life.

39:21.794 --> 39:24.100
When we go to dinner,

39:24.144 --> 39:25.406
where we vacation,

39:25.450 --> 39:27.234
whose place we stay at,
and... you know, look,

39:27.277 --> 39:29.149
most of the time
I don't really care.

39:29.192 --> 39:31.020
But on the big things, I do.

39:31.064 --> 39:32.631
And there's never
a compromise.

39:32.674 --> 39:34.763
That's not true.
Really?

39:34.807 --> 39:37.723
Fallon, we went from dating
to married with children,

39:37.766 --> 39:39.855
and I didn't even know about it.

39:41.204 --> 39:43.206
Well...

39:44.251 --> 39:46.384
I didn't realize how
serious you were

39:46.427 --> 39:47.472
about this whole
"no kids" thing.

39:47.515 --> 39:48.734
It's just...

39:48.777 --> 39:52.128
we both come from pretty
messed-up families.

39:52.172 --> 39:55.262
I guess I was just kind of
hoping to break the cycle.

39:55.305 --> 39:56.306
Yeah, well, me, too.

39:56.350 --> 39:58.091
Just the other way around.

39:58.134 --> 39:59.440
I've always wanted kids,

39:59.484 --> 40:01.442
and I think that you and I
could do it right.

40:01.486 --> 40:03.226
But if it's a choice

40:03.270 --> 40:05.751
between you and children,

40:05.794 --> 40:08.536
I mean... Liam, I choose you.

40:08.580 --> 40:09.755
You really mean that?

40:09.798 --> 40:11.104
Yeah.

40:11.147 --> 40:14.020
You see, I'm all
about compromise.

40:14.063 --> 40:16.065
Come here.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.073
Tell you what.

40:24.117 --> 40:25.814
Hmm?

40:25.858 --> 40:27.773
Why don't we see
where life takes us?

40:27.816 --> 40:29.427
Hmm.

40:29.470 --> 40:30.863
All right,
maybe we'll want children.

40:30.906 --> 40:31.951
Who knows?

40:31.994 --> 40:33.343
Maybe we won't.

40:33.387 --> 40:36.346
But we'll decide on it together.

40:36.390 --> 40:39.741
And I will suspend
the house search

40:39.785 --> 40:42.178
until we're both ready
to look for one.

40:42.222 --> 40:43.832
Okay.

40:43.876 --> 40:46.487
But I'm not backing down on
the 15-bedroom thing because...

40:46.531 --> 40:47.575
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

40:56.628 --> 40:58.499
Cristal!

40:58.543 --> 40:59.500
You're home!

40:59.544 --> 41:00.501
I took a late flight

41:00.545 --> 41:01.850
and thought I'd surprise you.

41:01.894 --> 41:03.461
Oh, it worked.

41:03.504 --> 41:05.375
It has been
so lonely here without you.

41:05.419 --> 41:06.681
Oh.

41:08.030 --> 41:09.249
I'm happy to be back.

41:09.292 --> 41:10.816
Well, I hope you spent
some quality time

41:10.859 --> 41:13.035
with your family in Mexico.Yes.

41:13.079 --> 41:14.733
I got exactly what I needed.

41:14.776 --> 41:17.213
So, what's the latest
around here?

41:17.257 --> 41:18.867
Are you back
at the helm of C.A.?

41:18.911 --> 41:21.391
Let's just say
I'm still working on it.

41:21.435 --> 41:23.785
Which reminds me, there...

41:23.829 --> 41:26.440
is something I need
to talk to you about.

41:29.356 --> 41:31.358
You can take that
right upstairs.

41:31.401 --> 41:32.664
Dominique?

41:32.707 --> 41:34.709
What the hell are
you doing here?

41:34.753 --> 41:36.276
Didn't Blake tell you?

41:36.319 --> 41:37.843
I'm moving in, dear.

41:37.886 --> 41:40.541
Yeah, that's the something
I need to talk to you about.

41:41.890 --> 41:44.066
Don't look so surprised,
Cristal.

41:44.110 --> 41:47.548
After all, I am a Carrington.

41:49.115 --> 41:50.333
This is where I belong.

41:50.377 --> 41:51.987
See you at breakfast.
