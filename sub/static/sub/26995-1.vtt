03:51.865 --> 03:55.669
Let us pray.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.005
Our Father in heaven,

03:58.038 --> 04:00.374
I want to thank you for this

04:00.408 --> 04:05.546
merciful day on this earth

04:05.546 --> 04:08.849
and for everybody
who has lost a loved one.

04:08.849 --> 04:12.019
In this prayer today,
I want to give a special thanks

04:12.052 --> 04:16.023
to my granddaughters' mother.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.892
May God protect her...

04:21.261 --> 04:23.464
If you can't control yourself
during a prayer.

04:23.464 --> 04:26.634
You will have to
excuse yourself.

04:26.634 --> 04:30.738
In the Father, Son, Holy Ghost.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.441
What is that glass doing
in front of that plate?

04:33.441 --> 04:35.443
What did I teach you
about etiquette?

04:35.443 --> 04:37.244
Forks to the left,
knives to the right.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.380
Why is this glass
in front of the plate?

04:39.380 --> 04:42.215
Forks to the left,
knives to the right,

04:42.249 --> 04:45.653
water glass in front
of the knife.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.463
Go ahead, let's eat.
Please!

05:28.295 --> 05:30.464
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello darling!

05:30.498 --> 05:32.666
Where've you been?
Where've you been?

05:32.666 --> 05:34.435
Did you get lost?

05:34.468 --> 05:36.804
- Oh, I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.173
- No, I really do.
I got worried about ya

05:40.173 --> 05:41.809
- not coming
- Aww, come on Dad.

05:41.809 --> 05:45.178
- or getting lost.
- You know I'd meet you anyplace,

05:45.178 --> 05:47.848
- I know that, I know that.
- Just not here.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.316
- I'm so happy now.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.984
- You look wonderful,
you look wonderful,

05:50.984 --> 05:53.787
- You too, you too.
- so happy you're here.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.356
You've made my day.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.393
- So, where are they?
- Where are they?

05:59.460 --> 06:01.061
You know, they're imagination.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.297
- They're upstairs.
- Oh, I know they're imagination.

06:04.331 --> 06:09.737
- Unbelievable.
- That's one way to put it.

06:09.737 --> 06:13.240
- But, uh, anyway I just put
some tea on the stove.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.042
- Make yourself a home.
- Sounds good.

06:15.042 --> 06:18.378
- Ok, I'll be right back.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.762
Girls!

06:34.762 --> 06:36.564
Good to see you.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.732
Why haven't you come
to visit us.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.903
Oh, well, I've been
busy with work.

06:42.903 --> 06:48.275
But you both look
so pretty and... and so tall.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.884
I've really been meaning
to come.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.086
I... They've just had me
traveling.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.589
I really wanted to come.
I-I did

07:01.622 --> 07:03.957
I, you know,
I have to travel a lot

07:03.957 --> 07:07.461
and I had to go to Paris,
and, oh...

07:27.715 --> 07:31.619
Dad?
You okay?

07:39.660 --> 07:42.062
Dad, I can't do this.
I can't do this.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.296
I told you there's a reason

07:43.296 --> 07:45.265
I don't like coming
to this house.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.600
- Bridgette..
- I've been here 30 seconds

07:46.600 --> 07:50.103
and I already have
a bad feeling.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.741
Bridgette, please.
I need help.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.143
Dad...

07:56.143 --> 07:59.479
I need help Bridgette.

08:02.282 --> 08:07.521
Fine, Dad,
just cut to the chase.

08:07.521 --> 08:12.359
What's gonna happen
to these kids if I die?

08:12.359 --> 08:16.196
You have been out
of their life for 6 years!

08:16.263 --> 08:19.266
For 6 years you have been
out of their life.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.969
What is gonna happen
to them when I die?

08:22.002 --> 08:26.006
Who's gonna
take care of them?

08:26.006 --> 08:30.811
Dad, what can I do?

08:30.811 --> 08:32.880
You drug them every night,

08:32.880 --> 08:37.150
you-you treat them
like lab rats!

08:37.183 --> 08:41.688
They haven't been out in 6
years!

08:41.688 --> 08:43.323
They're gonna be fine.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.193
They're gonna fine, Bridgette.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.029
They're gonna be able
to start a new life.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.898
They're gonna be able
to go to a park.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.133
Go to a park? Dad!

08:53.166 --> 08:55.135
They have never been outside!

08:55.135 --> 08:57.504
What do you mean
"go to a park"?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.573
Dad, please,

08:59.573 --> 09:02.209
they have to be
in a psychiatric ward.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.178
And you know this.
You're a scientist.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.580
You know there
are some things

09:06.580 --> 09:11.251
that doctors,
that no one can figure out.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.886
You know
what they're capable of.

09:12.886 --> 09:16.523
You've seen it.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.726
I need you to come back
into their lives.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.161
Do it for your sister!

09:21.194 --> 09:24.197
Listen, I-I never

09:24.197 --> 09:27.534
told you what happened
that night.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.107
It was right after
Julie passed away,

09:34.107 --> 09:36.376
not even 2 days.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.713
We didn't even
have the funeral.

09:39.713 --> 09:44.618
I was laying on the couch
and I fell asleep.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.954
And I heard the girls upstairs
and it woke me up

09:46.954 --> 09:49.456
and my first thought was,
my gosh,

09:49.522 --> 09:52.192
how can I...

09:52.192 --> 09:54.127
left them alone
by themselves,

09:54.127 --> 09:55.395
I'm supposed to be
watching them.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.964
So, I got up
and I ran upstairs

09:56.964 --> 09:59.399
as fast as I could and

09:59.432 --> 10:02.302
their voices were getting
louder and louder and...

10:19.086 --> 10:21.121
Dad, it wasn't
just their voice.

10:21.121 --> 10:26.927
Listen to me.
I heard Julie.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.963
And I walked around the corner
and everything looked normal,

10:29.963 --> 10:32.565
they were playing,
until I saw her.

10:32.599 --> 10:35.435
It was her.
It was Julie.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.637
And they stopped
and looked at me

10:37.637 --> 10:39.406
and she looked at me,
like, so disgusted,

10:39.439 --> 10:41.942
like I was disturbing them
and...

10:44.277 --> 10:46.279
...and we're gonna have fun

10:46.313 --> 10:47.480
and play together
and to be together

10:47.480 --> 10:49.349
forever and ever and ever
and...

10:55.455 --> 11:00.293
Don't worry girls.
Auntie was just leaving.

11:05.699 --> 11:09.036
I just ran out
as fast as I could.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.705
Dad, please, I'm begging you,

11:11.705 --> 11:15.876
before they hurt themselves,
before they hurt you.

11:15.943 --> 11:19.612
Listen to me.

11:19.612 --> 11:22.282
I can't.

11:22.315 --> 11:25.786
I'm sorry, I can't.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.425
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi, Mr. Salvatore.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.693
- How are you?
- Alright, great, come on in.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.529
- The weather.
- Gloomy out there.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.231
- Yeah, it's looking
good though.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.233
- How you been?
- I'm great. How are you?

12:46.233 --> 12:49.536
- Alright, pretty good.
Pretty, pretty good.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.271
- Where are the girls?
- Oh, they're upstairs.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.773
Come on down, girls.
Say hello to Mary.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.276
I'm so happy that you're here.
You have no idea.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.477
- No problem.
- I mean this,

12:57.544 --> 12:59.379
this gives me a chance
to get out

12:59.379 --> 13:00.747
and do the things
that I have to do.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.482
- Good, I'm glad.
I'm happy to do it.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.750
Where are the girls?
- Yeah, they're here.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.487
Come on down girls.
Say hello to Mary.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.758
Hi, girls. How are you?

13:11.758 --> 13:15.328
Good, thanks.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.464
Ok, Mary, you just gotta
do me one favor.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.833
You just gotta keep them
occupied while I'm gone.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.169
- Okay.
- If you can do that, I'm just--

13:22.169 --> 13:24.404
you're gonna have
a great wonderful day.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.239
- Okay
- But just, please,

13:26.239 --> 13:32.112
keep them occupied.
Okay, girls, back.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.513
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom.

14:40.513 --> 14:43.183
I have some great news.
Can you talk?

14:43.183 --> 14:45.986
So, I went
to the doctor today

14:45.986 --> 14:48.588
and they did a sonogram
on my stomach.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.490
You remember that lump
in my stomach

14:50.523 --> 14:53.193
that we thought
might've been cancerous?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.328
It turns out
that I'm pregnant!

14:55.328 --> 14:56.896
Oh, that's so wonderful.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.733
Mom, can you believe that?
You're going to be a grandma!

15:00.767 --> 15:03.603
What? A grandmother?

15:03.603 --> 15:06.506
That's wonderful.
I'm so exited!

15:06.539 --> 15:07.674
That's...

16:54.514 --> 16:57.950
- Hi, Mr. Salvatore.
- Hi, Mary. How was your day?

16:57.984 --> 16:59.852
- It was great,
a little strange.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.855
- Really? Well...
How's the girls?

17:02.889 --> 17:04.057
- They're good.
They're sleeping.

17:04.124 --> 17:10.029
- No! No!
I told you no sleeping.

17:10.029 --> 17:14.367
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Just go, Mary, go!

17:22.142 --> 17:23.576
Hello?
Hey, Mom.

17:23.576 --> 17:27.180
I have some great news.
Can you talk?

17:27.214 --> 17:30.217
Yes?
Yes, honey.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.919
So, I went
to the doctor today

17:32.919 --> 17:35.722
and they did a sonogram
on my stomach.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.524
You remember that lump
in my stomach

17:37.557 --> 17:40.327
that we thought
might have been cancerous?

17:40.327 --> 17:42.762
It turns out
that I'm pregnant!

17:42.762 --> 17:44.097
Didn't we just have
this conversation

17:44.164 --> 17:45.832
a little while ago?

17:45.832 --> 17:48.268
No. I didn't call you before.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.571
Where are you?
Are you okay?

17:51.571 --> 17:55.908
No? You didn't call me?

18:19.031 --> 18:23.303
Girls?

25:18.551 --> 25:20.553
- Are you serious?
- Just tie 'em up.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.247

25:50.182 --> 25:51.718

25:51.718 --> 25:53.686

You got 'em using drugs, man?!

25:53.720 --> 25:55.822

26:07.099 --> 26:09.368
He got the kids using drugs!

26:09.401 --> 26:11.037
No, listen, don't tell me
how to do my job!

26:11.037 --> 26:12.739
No! You don't tell me
how to do my job!

26:12.739 --> 26:14.573
- We gotta get out of here!
- You want to be on this job?

26:14.607 --> 26:16.743
You're gonna do
what I tell you to do!

26:16.743 --> 26:17.777
So, you tie him up,
put him in the closet!

26:17.844 --> 26:20.346
- Come on, man!
- Yo, chill man!

26:20.346 --> 26:22.014
- Just chill!

26:24.583 --> 26:29.856
- Please, they're sick!
Take the money and go!

26:29.856 --> 26:36.128
Hey, Hey, you alright?
- Take the money and go, please.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.130
- Come here.
Make this easy for me.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.532
- We're gonna go in here, ok?
- Alright.

26:40.566 --> 26:42.368
- And then you'll leave?
- Take the money and leave?

26:42.368 --> 26:46.238
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Please, no more.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.074
- No more, please.
- No more, no more.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.943
- Please no more.

26:50.943 --> 26:55.948
Take the money and go.

26:55.982 --> 26:59.719
Oh, God!
Take the money and go.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.755
- Yeah, yeah, we're gonna
take the money and go.

27:05.457 --> 27:10.629
Let me say, you know,
I must thank you

27:10.629 --> 27:12.965
for this great stuff
that's in this house.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.334
The money, the jewels,

27:15.334 --> 27:18.570
we just cleaned you out.
It's gone.

27:18.604 --> 27:21.340
It's all gone.

27:21.340 --> 27:25.344
Please, my heart medicine...

27:25.344 --> 27:30.249
top dresser drawer
on the right?

27:30.282 --> 27:32.952
Despite you being
a sick bastard...

27:32.952 --> 27:35.187
for what you did
to us those kids?

27:35.187 --> 27:38.825
- I need my heart medicine.
Please.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.960
- You know, if it was up to me,
I'd just, uh,

27:40.993 --> 27:42.995
slice your throat.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.197
As far as I'm concerned,

27:45.197 --> 27:49.468
you can just
sit there and die.

27:49.501 --> 27:53.639
Not mention that you got
pretty good food here.

28:02.548 --> 28:04.050
- Please, I need
the heart medicine.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.130
Hey, come 'ere.

28:18.164 --> 28:22.501
Got you some water.

28:22.501 --> 28:25.204
Yo!

28:25.204 --> 28:27.206
You alright?

28:34.881 --> 28:38.317
I got you some water.
Hey!

28:38.317 --> 28:40.252
Wake up!

28:56.568 --> 29:01.073
Yo, Miles, Ricci,
get over here!

29:01.073 --> 29:02.408
- What's wrong? What's up?
- He's dead, man!

29:02.441 --> 29:04.610
- He's not dead!
- He's dead man!

29:04.676 --> 29:07.246
Listen, I roughed him up
but I didn't kill him.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.248
- Yeah, yeah, you messed him up,
alright. He's dead!

29:09.281 --> 29:11.884
- No, he's not dead, man.
- No pulse, no heart beat.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.385
Listen, it was a job
we had to do.

29:13.385 --> 29:14.586
- It was job? It was a job?
- Listen, I told you

29:14.586 --> 29:16.455
we had a job we had to do,
you did that job

29:16.522 --> 29:18.124
and that's it, man!
- Yeah, yeah.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.358
- Let's just round up our stuff
and go, come on!

29:19.391 --> 29:20.893
- Come on, man!
Don't worry about it.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.231
- That wasn't
the game plan, man!

29:35.441 --> 29:37.609
So, you're up?
Okay.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.245
You probably want to know
why you're tied up.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.147
We got a job
we got to do downstairs,

29:41.147 --> 29:42.748
we takin' care
of a few things,

29:42.781 --> 29:44.716
but we're gonna be
out of here shortly.

29:44.716 --> 29:47.486
All you gotta do is
just relax, stay calm,

29:47.486 --> 29:50.990
and everything will fall
in place, alright?

29:50.990 --> 29:53.325
- Where's Grandpa?
- He's downstairs.

29:53.392 --> 29:56.128
He's just relaxing.
Just take it easy.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.497
Don't move, alright?

30:10.342 --> 30:12.478
How the heck
did you do that?

30:12.478 --> 30:15.247
What the hell
are you doin'?

30:20.252 --> 30:25.091
Hi, Miles.
You have been bad to Grandpa.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.793
Girl, you don't...

30:35.167 --> 30:38.470
He took care of us.
He loved us.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.973
Now, you won't
be able to leave.

30:40.973 --> 30:43.609
You're dad was a preacher.
You know the Bible quite well,

30:43.609 --> 30:47.947
don't you?
An eye for an eye.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.716
Tonight will be
your punishment for Grandpa

30:50.716 --> 30:54.686
and it will be biblical.

31:07.133 --> 31:10.302
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

31:10.302 --> 31:13.505
What's going on?
Hey, hey!

31:13.539 --> 31:16.375
- My arm! My arm, man!
- What about your arm, man?

31:16.375 --> 31:20.046
- What's going on?
- My arm!

31:20.079 --> 31:22.148
Come on,
let's get out of here.

31:22.181 --> 31:23.983
Let's get out of here,
come on.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.614
Who's there?

32:12.731 --> 32:14.366
Hey!

32:16.802 --> 32:18.804
Come here!

32:58.310 --> 33:02.581
Hey, what's happening to me?

33:02.581 --> 33:04.316
So help me God, if you don't
let me out of this chair,

33:04.316 --> 33:06.785
I'll split your head
wide open.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.323
Don't you recognize this place?

33:13.192 --> 33:17.329
We injected you
with a neurotoxin

33:17.329 --> 33:19.165
that will paralyze you
from the shoulders

33:19.165 --> 33:21.300
down to your feet.

33:24.170 --> 33:27.773
And we have a very
special guest for you.

33:37.683 --> 33:42.188
And this, you won't be
able to talk at all.

33:54.333 --> 33:58.504
Do you hear her footsteps?
She's coming.

33:58.537 --> 34:02.374
You never even went
to her funeral.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.411
You never even took care
of your own mother.

34:05.411 --> 34:09.681
You let her die?
How could you?

34:13.552 --> 34:15.687
Ricci!

34:17.922 --> 34:22.228
Ricci!
Ricci!

34:22.228 --> 34:26.931
My boy! Mommy's here.
Where are you?

34:26.998 --> 34:30.001
My boy.
You disappointed Mommy, now.

34:30.034 --> 34:32.704
You made Mommy so upset.

34:32.704 --> 34:36.007
We have talked about this!

34:36.007 --> 34:38.877
There's only one choice
that you leave me.

34:38.909 --> 34:40.679
I'm cutting your hair.

34:40.679 --> 34:44.683
I'm cutting every piece
of your hair off!

34:44.683 --> 34:47.219
Do you want to see Mommy
hurt herself again?

34:47.253 --> 34:49.688
How many times
do I need to cut myself

34:49.688 --> 34:52.023
before you will learn?!

34:52.056 --> 34:54.126
What am I gonna
do with you?!

34:54.126 --> 34:58.130
I pray, and pray,
and pray every day!

34:58.197 --> 35:00.599
When will you learn?!

35:00.599 --> 35:03.769
Your father was useless
and a dead-beat husband.

35:03.802 --> 35:06.905
You're just like him!

35:06.938 --> 35:09.241
I'm sorry that I had you!

35:45.143 --> 35:47.913
Louie! Louie!

35:47.946 --> 35:50.282
Oh, my God, Louie?

35:50.316 --> 35:52.684
I haven't seen you in a while!
- Yeah.

35:52.684 --> 35:55.921
- Where have you been?
- I've been around.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.789
- You know, you haven't been
at the Ariana Waterfalls

35:57.823 --> 36:01.159
in a while.
I'm so glad to see you here.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.762
Well, everyone's waiting
for you, and your dad.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.096
We're ready to have fun.

36:05.130 --> 36:06.998
Louie, why don't you relax

36:06.998 --> 36:09.501
and let's go grab
a cocktail, hmm?

36:09.501 --> 36:11.169
- I don't know.
- Look, everybody's waiting

36:11.203 --> 36:12.538
for you in the other room.

36:12.538 --> 36:14.306
- Even your dad's there
- My dad?

36:14.340 --> 36:16.174
- You don't want to keep
him waiting, right?

36:16.174 --> 36:19.611
- Hold on.
- Louie, you just need to relax.

36:19.645 --> 36:21.447
I told you,
let's start with one cocktail

36:21.447 --> 36:23.615
- No-no-no-no-no.
- and go from there.

36:23.649 --> 36:26.184
Louie, what's going on?
- Listen, there's something...

36:26.184 --> 36:28.687
I really think
we just need to relax.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.557
Let's get you a cocktail,
you need to start having fun.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.725
- Come, follow me.
- Something's wrong.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.527
- You just need
to come with me and...

36:41.467 --> 36:43.335
- Anyways, your dad hasn't
- Wait a second. Listen,

36:43.369 --> 36:45.504
- seen you in a while
and he's waiting for you

36:45.504 --> 36:48.006
- and so is everybody else.
- Listen...

36:48.039 --> 36:50.309
- what's the hold up,
Louie. Come on!

36:50.309 --> 36:52.711
- S-something's happening here.
Come and have some fun.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.813
I feel like you just
need a cocktail

36:54.846 --> 36:57.015
and everything's
going to get a bit better...

36:57.048 --> 36:59.851
- No! No, no,
- Absolutely!

36:59.851 --> 37:01.853
- Nothing's getting better.
- Okay, just follow me and...

37:01.853 --> 37:04.556
- Oh, boyo!
where the hell you been?

37:04.556 --> 37:07.993
- Listen, listen,
I need your help.

37:08.026 --> 37:11.363
- You forget where your home is?
- No, no, listen.

37:11.363 --> 37:13.098
We were at this place,
we were doing this job...

37:13.098 --> 37:15.401
- Oh, no, no.
I don't wanna hear it,

37:15.401 --> 37:16.535
I don't wanna hear it, okay?
I don't wanna hear it.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.671
- You're the only one.
Come on, just...

37:22.374 --> 37:26.244
- You on that junk again?
- No!

37:26.244 --> 37:28.914
Listen me, we were doin'
a job with the guys.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.749
- You know 'em
- I don't wanna hear it.

37:30.749 --> 37:35.253
- Where are we going?
- You'll find out.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.426
- Remember this freakin' guy?
- I remember him.

37:40.459 --> 37:43.295
- How you doin'?
- Your father's inside.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.205
Oh, you see this guy?

37:54.205 --> 37:55.574
Could've written
his own ticket,

37:55.607 --> 37:58.910
could've had anything.
Now look at him.

38:07.553 --> 38:10.422
No, no, what are those
two girls doing here?

38:10.456 --> 38:13.892
What are they... doing here?
- What's wrong with you?

38:13.892 --> 38:19.097
Look at you.
You look like crap!

38:19.130 --> 38:22.968
You're on the crap, too,
aren't ya? Huh?

38:22.968 --> 38:24.503
Just look at you.
You're an embarrassment

38:24.503 --> 38:26.638
to the family.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.273
Is this true all this shit
I'm hearin', huh?

38:28.306 --> 38:31.477
You tyin' up kids?
You breakin' into houses?

38:31.477 --> 38:33.445
You'll never
amount to anything.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.313
You know what you are?
You're dirt.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.248
You're nothin'--
don't even look at me,

38:37.282 --> 38:38.484
don't even look at me
'cuz I'll smack ya right now!

38:38.484 --> 38:40.352
You hear me?
You represent me, you know?

38:40.419 --> 38:43.088
You're name is my name.
You're my blood

38:43.121 --> 38:46.291
and you're nothing
but an embarrassment.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.293
You've been a dissapointment
from the day you were born.

38:48.293 --> 38:50.462
What did I tell you?
What've I been telling you?

38:50.496 --> 38:51.830
You coulda had
a piece of the pie.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.099
You coulda had
a little bit yourself, huh?

38:54.099 --> 38:56.702
You piece of crap!

38:56.702 --> 38:58.036
Do me a favor, girls.
Go to the bar

38:58.036 --> 39:01.473
and I'll see you in a minute.

39:01.507 --> 39:06.845
You know, I came here tonight
to kick a little ass

39:06.845 --> 39:11.149
and have a little scotch,
and I'm outta scotch.

39:15.721 --> 39:18.223
Get him the hell outta here!

39:44.149 --> 39:50.155
Don't worry, this won't hurt.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.891
And it will not be over soon.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.638
I can't believe...
I can't believe...

40:54.085 --> 40:55.987
Ooh, man!

41:22.347 --> 41:25.684
Miles, we've been
waiting for you.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.997
Today my friends,
we are talking about value.

42:11.997 --> 42:14.165
Do not settle for ordinary,

42:14.165 --> 42:17.335
when you have the power
to be extraordinary!

42:17.368 --> 42:20.639
We are going to talk about
the valuing of yourself.

42:20.639 --> 42:24.042
The value of your
relationships with your family,

42:24.042 --> 42:26.044
and the value
of your relationship

42:26.077 --> 42:28.079
- with God Almighty...
- Shhh,

42:28.079 --> 42:30.716
if you keep quiet,
they can't hear you.

42:30.716 --> 42:32.050
...is I want you to always

42:32.083 --> 42:34.352
look forward in your life.

42:43.895 --> 42:47.666
Do you think you're dreaming?
Pinch yourself.

42:50.769 --> 42:53.672
I'm tired of these games!
Answer me!

42:53.705 --> 42:55.707
What's going on?!

43:05.383 --> 43:07.385
You know, I know you.

43:07.418 --> 43:11.389
You used to come here
with your mama many years ago.

43:11.389 --> 43:16.394
People, there is goodness
in this person.

43:16.394 --> 43:19.765
No! He's the Devil!
He's evil!

43:19.765 --> 43:22.433
I saw him dragging bodies
into the woods!

43:22.467 --> 43:24.302
I know how you
make your bones.

43:24.369 --> 43:27.538
You're a devil!
You are evil!

43:27.572 --> 43:29.641
Let's burn him
and bury him

43:29.641 --> 43:31.242
like we did with
all the Devil worshippers!

43:31.276 --> 43:32.644
- That's right!
- Ask him!

43:32.644 --> 43:35.213
Ask him what he did
to his own mother!

43:35.246 --> 43:38.216
She wants him dead!
Demon!

43:38.216 --> 43:40.819
Burn him!
Burn him now!

43:40.819 --> 43:42.320
Take him to the cross!

43:42.320 --> 43:44.756
Take to the cross
and let justice be served!

43:44.790 --> 43:46.291
He's the Devil!
Get him!

43:46.291 --> 43:48.293
Burn him!
Burn him!

43:48.293 --> 43:50.829
Where do you think
you're going?

43:50.896 --> 43:56.134
Burn him. Burn him. Burn him.

43:56.134 --> 43:58.303
Drag him!
Take him to the preacher!

43:58.303 --> 44:02.440
Get on your knees!

44:04.776 --> 44:08.780
Mmh! My people,
my children,

44:08.814 --> 44:12.483
the sound of that bell,
that is the sound of judgment!

44:12.483 --> 44:16.487
Judgment is in the air
and when judgment is in the air,

44:16.521 --> 44:18.489
we've got a trial.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.859
'Cause this man
who stands before us,

44:20.926 --> 44:23.194
kneels before us,

44:23.194 --> 44:26.832
he came to this church
and he left this church!

44:26.832 --> 44:29.267
We must have a trial!

44:29.300 --> 44:31.803
This man stands before us,

44:31.837 --> 44:34.672
he has been to this church
before as a child

44:34.672 --> 44:38.276
but then he left us!
He abandoned us!

44:38.276 --> 44:41.446
He let the Devil treat him
as a dirty dishrag.

44:41.479 --> 44:42.714
- Yes, he did.
- Yes.

44:42.714 --> 44:45.550
And he did all kinds
of atrocities and evils,

44:45.550 --> 44:48.553
and he has left us,
he abandoned us,

44:48.553 --> 44:50.055
- Yes, he did!
- and thought that he could

44:50.055 --> 44:52.157
come back to this church

44:52.190 --> 44:55.326
- He needs to be punished!
- unnoticed!

44:55.326 --> 44:59.197
But we noticed you!
We noticed your smelly,

44:59.197 --> 45:03.201
stank, horrible likeness.
- Burn him.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.503
- And I've come here to say

45:05.536 --> 45:08.339
that judgment has got to be
taken right now.

45:08.339 --> 45:12.477
You have got to be tried
for your crimes,

45:12.477 --> 45:16.514
your transgressions
and the craze you have created,

45:16.547 --> 45:19.384
that you have enacted
against this church

45:19.384 --> 45:21.586
and these people!
- That's right!

45:21.586 --> 45:23.221
- Let's get him!

45:23.221 --> 45:25.190
Vanquish him!
- Ok!

45:27.425 --> 45:31.262
The preacher has spoken!
Burn him at the stake!

45:45.243 --> 45:49.848
You!
You!

45:49.848 --> 45:52.183
You monster!

45:52.183 --> 45:55.253
We're gonna burn you!

45:55.253 --> 45:57.388
You were supposed to be
my favorite son.

45:57.422 --> 46:00.091
You're supposed to take care
of your mother!

46:00.091 --> 46:03.795
Not kill her!
You loser!

46:03.862 --> 46:07.899
I hate youuuuuu!

46:11.870 --> 46:13.704
How many opportunities, huh?

46:13.738 --> 46:17.108
How many opportunities
I gave you to come in, huh?

46:17.108 --> 46:19.144
Didn't a give you a shot?

46:19.210 --> 46:21.112
I gave you so many shots
to get into this family

46:21.112 --> 46:23.314
and look at you,
you blew everyone.

46:23.381 --> 46:25.550
Look at you!
You are disgusting!

46:25.550 --> 46:27.485
You make me sick!

46:31.957 --> 46:34.092
You know, he's still breathing?

47:32.283 --> 47:36.121
Aww, does it hurt?

47:36.154 --> 47:38.656
It looks like it hurts.

47:45.363 --> 47:47.365
Dad!

47:47.365 --> 47:52.904
Dad, please!
I'm your son, God damn it!

47:55.006 --> 47:58.709
Please!

47:58.709 --> 48:02.213
Da-Dad!

48:55.967 --> 48:58.469
Hello?!

49:00.105 --> 49:01.106
You live in the street

49:01.106 --> 49:02.773
like a rat!
That's what you are.

49:02.773 --> 49:05.043
You're nothing but a rat.
You're lower than scum.

49:05.076 --> 49:07.278
You'll never amount
to anything.

49:07.278 --> 49:09.214
You're an embarrassment, huh?

49:09.247 --> 49:12.250
You're an embarrassment
to the family.

49:23.561 --> 49:25.063
Hello?!

49:36.841 --> 49:40.011
You are useless!
You're just like your father!

49:40.078 --> 49:43.981
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you!

49:43.981 --> 49:46.251
A dirty, nasty,
filthy little boy

49:46.284 --> 49:47.985
that needs to learn a lesson!

49:47.985 --> 49:50.121
Do you remember when Mommy
put you in the boiling water?

49:50.155 --> 49:51.656
I can do it again!

49:51.656 --> 49:55.993
Do you remember that?
Do you remember?

50:52.250 --> 50:58.756
I've had enough, alright?
You win.

50:58.756 --> 51:02.160
Please, just tell me
how to get out of

51:02.193 --> 51:04.729
this, this place.

51:04.729 --> 51:05.763
- How can I get out?

51:05.763 --> 51:07.865
No one understood
our abilities.

51:07.898 --> 51:12.737
- Not even my own mother.
- We can go anywhere we want

51:12.737 --> 51:16.341
at any time in anyone's mind.

51:18.876 --> 51:22.580
We loved Grandpa.
He would drug us every night

51:22.580 --> 51:25.916
so we wouldn't have to come
to this place.

51:28.253 --> 51:29.854
We don't need your pity.

51:29.887 --> 51:32.423
You came into the wrong house!

51:32.423 --> 51:36.261
Louie! Yo, where are you?

51:36.294 --> 51:40.097
- Over here, where you at bud?
- Over here.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.599
Where you been, man?
Where you been?

51:41.599 --> 51:43.568
Some crazy stuff's going on
in this house.

51:43.601 --> 51:45.203
- There's some
crazy shit going on.

51:45.203 --> 51:47.538
These two girls,
these two twins girls, right?

51:47.538 --> 51:49.374
Yes, yes, yes, twins, yeah!
There's two of 'em.

51:49.374 --> 51:52.410
Listen, they-they-they did
something to me where

51:52.443 --> 51:54.445
I'm seeing my dead mother.
My dead mother came back.

51:54.445 --> 51:55.780
- She's tormenting me, man.
- W-w-w-wait,

51:55.813 --> 51:58.048
- you said you saw your mother?
- I seen my mother.

51:58.082 --> 51:59.484
I seen my mother, man.
My dead mother.

51:59.484 --> 52:01.319
- You said you saw your mother?
- Yeah, I seen my mother.

52:01.386 --> 52:04.722
Yo, I just saw my father!
I saw my father,

52:04.722 --> 52:08.626
I saw his men,
his right-hand man.

52:08.626 --> 52:11.596
They kicked the shit out of me
a few minutes ago...

52:13.231 --> 52:15.566
Dude, I don't know
what's going on

52:15.566 --> 52:18.436
but it's something about
those twins.

52:18.469 --> 52:20.405
Listen, man. My mother,
she brought me back

52:20.405 --> 52:22.640
into this salon where she used
to torment me

52:22.640 --> 52:24.008
when I was a kid

52:24.074 --> 52:26.010
and I just want
to get out of here.

52:26.010 --> 52:28.112
Yeah, I just went
through something

52:28.145 --> 52:29.647
very, very similar
to that, alright?

52:29.647 --> 52:32.183
I-I can't even
explain it, alright?

52:32.250 --> 52:34.452
Where's Miles?
You seen him at all?

52:34.485 --> 52:37.121
- Nah, I ain't seen Miles, man.
- I haven't seen him either.

52:37.121 --> 52:40.024
I don't know.
Uh...

52:40.024 --> 52:43.861
Listen, all I know is
that we gotta get out...

52:43.928 --> 52:45.696
The girls...

52:45.696 --> 52:47.598
Listen, remember that guy

52:47.632 --> 52:49.434
when we first broke
into this place?

52:49.434 --> 52:51.135
- Yeah.
- The old man, right?

52:51.168 --> 52:53.504
and you know, you-you,

52:53.504 --> 52:54.839
you kicked his ass and then
now looked what happened, right?

52:54.839 --> 52:56.474
Yeah.
- Alright?

52:56.507 --> 52:58.476
When you guys were upstairs,
he told me some stuff.

52:58.476 --> 53:01.879
Some real creepy shit,
alright, ok?

53:01.879 --> 53:03.147
I'm gonna tell you

53:03.180 --> 53:04.649
and I'm not freaking out,
alright?

53:04.649 --> 53:06.351
Everything I've ever taken
has worn off, alright?

53:06.351 --> 53:08.719
I'm just trying to get
out of here alive, ok?

53:08.786 --> 53:14.625
He said,
don't let them wake up!

53:14.659 --> 53:17.862
Alright?
Don't let the twins wake up!

53:17.862 --> 53:20.030
That's the key to getting
out of this place.

53:20.064 --> 53:22.233
Wake up? Wake up?
These kids are up!

53:22.300 --> 53:24.469
The twins are up.
They did this to us.

53:24.502 --> 53:27.572
This is why
we're in this situation!

53:27.572 --> 53:29.307
What we gotta do is--
We gotta get outta here!

53:29.340 --> 53:30.741
- You're right, you're right.

53:30.741 --> 53:32.410
We already got their stuff.
- Let's go!

53:32.410 --> 53:35.246
- Listen...
- They did this.

53:37.748 --> 53:40.718
How the hell are we gonna
get out of this place?!

53:42.753 --> 53:46.257
Look, we find Miles
and we get out.

53:46.257 --> 53:48.025
There's gotta be
some kind of escape route

53:48.058 --> 53:49.193
out of this place.

53:49.193 --> 53:51.195
I've never done
a job like this!

53:51.228 --> 53:52.663
Listen, alright?

53:52.663 --> 53:53.998
There's gotta be
a way out of here.

53:53.998 --> 53:57.201
We gotta find it, okay?

53:57.234 --> 53:58.736
- I agree.
- Alright?

53:58.736 --> 54:00.571
Let's, uh...
we gotta look for somethin'.

54:00.571 --> 54:02.239
Alright, why don't we meet up
in a few minutes?

54:02.239 --> 54:03.674
See if you find anything

54:03.708 --> 54:05.910
and we'll check back
in the same spot, alright?

54:05.910 --> 54:07.244
Sure, I'll try
to get out of here.

54:07.278 --> 54:09.514
But we can't leave
without Miles, okay?

54:09.547 --> 54:11.048
We find a way out,
we meet right here

54:11.048 --> 54:12.550
in a few minutes.
We find some--

54:12.550 --> 54:14.719
even if we don't
find a way out,

54:14.719 --> 54:16.186
we meet right here
in a few minutes alright?

54:16.186 --> 54:18.222
Don't walk too far.
Alright?

54:28.733 --> 54:31.902
What the hell...

55:51.849 --> 55:56.887
Louie!
Louie!

55:59.724 --> 56:01.559
Louie!

56:06.631 --> 56:08.899
Louie!

56:49.674 --> 56:53.878
Mommy cut herself again!
Do you wanna watch?

56:59.049 --> 57:00.885
Don't be afraid.

57:00.918 --> 57:04.021
Don't run from Mommy!

57:10.427 --> 57:13.397
Open the door!
Don't be afraid of Mommy!

57:13.430 --> 57:16.967
Open the door!

57:16.967 --> 57:20.437
Ricci!

57:26.944 --> 57:32.282
Ricci! Ricci!

57:32.282 --> 57:35.052
- Man, listen!
- Something's going down!

57:35.085 --> 57:37.421
- Something's wrong
with this house, man!

57:37.421 --> 57:39.256
- My mother's here in this house.
- Listen...

57:39.289 --> 57:41.659
- I told you this house
is crazy, man!

57:41.659 --> 57:43.728
- The girls? Alright?
You seen then? You've seen them.

57:43.761 --> 57:45.329
Listen, there's something
crazy with this house!

57:45.329 --> 57:46.764
We need to get up
out of here, man!

57:46.797 --> 57:48.132
The Devil's in here
or something, man!

57:48.132 --> 57:52.002
- We got to go, man!
- Let's go!

57:52.069 --> 57:54.939
Guys? Guys?

57:54.972 --> 57:57.307
Miles!
Miles, man, get up!

57:57.307 --> 58:01.278
Louie! Louie!
Guys, come on!

58:01.278 --> 58:03.514
I can't do this.
I gotta get outta here!

58:03.514 --> 58:05.750
I gotta go!

58:11.255 --> 58:13.591
You guys...

58:13.591 --> 58:16.994
You were in there...

58:16.994 --> 58:18.596
We told you three times

58:18.629 --> 58:22.299
to meet us at the car.
What are you doing?

58:22.332 --> 58:24.168
Let's go, Ricci.
We outta here, man!

58:24.168 --> 58:27.705
We gotta get outta here!

58:27.705 --> 58:29.807
Yo, man...

58:29.840 --> 58:32.677
- The two girls, huh?
- What?

58:32.677 --> 58:36.681
- What's it gonna be, huh?
- The grandfather?

58:36.681 --> 58:39.183
- Life?
The chair?

58:39.216 --> 58:42.653
- What are you guys
talkin' about?

58:42.687 --> 58:44.188
- You know exactly
what we're talking about.

58:44.188 --> 58:46.857
- The jewels, Ricci.

58:46.857 --> 58:50.394
- Stay back!
Stay back.

58:50.394 --> 58:53.964
I don't know
whatcha talkin' about.

58:53.998 --> 58:58.068
- You don't remember?
- Remember what?

58:58.068 --> 59:00.571
All I did was
get the jewels.

59:00.571 --> 59:03.040
- And his jewels?
You took his jewels?

59:03.040 --> 59:05.576
- That's messed up!
- I didn't kill anybody.

59:05.643 --> 59:09.313
- That's low.
That's low brother.

59:09.346 --> 59:11.181
- I didn't kill nobody, man!

59:11.181 --> 59:13.684
I don't know what
you're talking about.

59:19.023 --> 59:20.825
You can sit
next down to Mommy

59:20.825 --> 59:23.193
and watch her cut herself
and make her bleed.

59:23.227 --> 59:25.362
Do you remember those days

59:25.362 --> 59:26.664
when I cut myself
and you watched me bleed?

59:26.664 --> 59:29.166
And did nothing!

59:29.199 --> 59:33.170
You're gonna hold
the razor this time.

59:33.170 --> 59:37.675
Do wanna see Mommy
cut herself again?

01:00:02.132 --> 01:00:05.069
Oh, no!
No, no.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:07.204
Y-y-your not real.

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:10.074
You're not real.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:14.611
You're not real.
No way, no way!

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.213
You're not real.

01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:18.248
See, the problem is
you're a fool.

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:20.951
You're a big fool!

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:24.554
You're a fool.

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:35.933
You disgraced me.

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:40.104
No, no.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:42.106
Talkin' 'bout me
being a druggie.

01:00:42.106 --> 01:00:44.108
You a druggie.

01:00:44.108 --> 01:00:45.442
I ain't never been
welcome in this house

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.311
Talkin' 'bout welcome
in your house.

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:50.180
I ain't never been welcome.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.817
Just don't get it.

01:00:58.355 --> 01:01:01.525
I might be a drunk

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:04.294
but I'm no fool.

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:12.469
Never been a fool.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.643
You gotta change.

01:01:22.847 --> 01:01:25.049
You gotta change.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:28.518
Told you, you're not welcome.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:31.789
Yeah, I'm a drunk.

01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:36.861
Yes, I am.

01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:39.296
but what are you?

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:46.336
What are you?

01:01:49.006 --> 01:01:52.142
Poor human being
for an excuse of living.

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:54.344
Why?

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:03.220
Been a good father

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:07.691
but I did some
bad things though.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.435
I wouldn't be here
no more, man!

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:22.072
I shoulda never came
in this house!

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.741
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:27.177
I'm sorry!

01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:36.954
A passerby minds his business.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.222
Over there,

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:14.624
- you see that over there?
- I have no idea

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.226
but it looks like us.
- It looks likes us,

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.929
but how is that us
and we're here?

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:25.402
- All I know is that I'm me.
Are you you?

01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:27.104
- I'm me.
- You're you?

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.306
Listen, we need to get
out of here.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:30.574
That's what we need to do.

01:03:30.574 --> 01:03:34.644
We need to find R-Ricc--
Ricci, Ricci!

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:39.449
- Ricci, Ricci, come here.
- Come here. Shhhh!

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:42.286
Over there.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:49.927
- You see 'em?

01:03:49.927 --> 01:03:52.262
- What's that?

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:56.100
- That's us, man.
- That's supposed to be us.

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:58.602
- This is some real
crazy stuff, man.

01:03:58.602 --> 01:04:02.472
- How, down there?
How, man?

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:06.043
- I don't know, I don't know.
- We need to get out of here.

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:07.945
That's what we need,
to get out.

01:04:07.978 --> 01:04:10.814
- Ricci...
- This ain't right? Are you you?

01:04:10.814 --> 01:04:13.350
- Are you you?

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.785
- We need to go.
We need to get up outta here.

01:04:15.819 --> 01:04:18.488
I don't care what you guys say.
We need to get up outta here.

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:21.291
This is messing
with my head, man, okay?

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:23.660
We need to break!

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:27.197
- I'm not right.
This is some crazy shit.

01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:32.302
- I just think
this is crazy.

01:04:34.138 --> 01:04:36.140
- You really think
it's gonna be that easy

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.142
to walk out that door?

01:04:38.142 --> 01:04:40.144
- Look, the door's right there!

01:04:40.144 --> 01:04:42.312
- Listen, I'm gonna make
a run for the door.

01:04:42.346 --> 01:04:43.680
We need to make
a run for the door.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:44.915
I done had enough
of this house.

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:47.184
- 3 seconds and we're free, man.
3 seconds!

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:49.053
- Let's go,
let's go, man!

01:04:49.053 --> 01:04:51.221
- Let's do it.
- Let's go. Ready?

01:04:51.255 --> 01:04:52.589
- Let's get outta here, man.

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:54.858
Come on, man!
- Let's go, let's go!

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.172
- Hey, we're back
to the same spot, man.

01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:10.840
What happened?
- Listen, something ain't right.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.176
We need to try this again

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:13.343
but we need to get
outta here.

01:05:13.343 --> 01:05:14.844
I don't care what we do
at this point, man.

01:05:14.878 --> 01:05:17.181
We need to go.
This ain't a game, man.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.087
- Listen to yourself, alright?
Hold it together.

01:05:23.087 --> 01:05:25.622
We just ran
down there, alright?

01:05:25.689 --> 01:05:28.959
- Listen...
- You got another idea?

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:31.195
- I just wanna go, man.
I don't care.

01:05:31.228 --> 01:05:33.730
- I wanna go, too!
I wanna go, too!

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:35.365
- Listen, I'm gonna run again

01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:36.800
and this time
I'm running fast, man.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.069
I'm running out the door.
I've had enough of this house,

01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:40.937
I'm spooked out man.
I'm tired, man.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:42.739
I just wanna get
outta here man!

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:46.310
This is getting crazy.
This is getting crazy!

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:50.480
- Hear me out!
This is all mental.

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:53.217
There's something,
there's something up.

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:55.485
I have no idea
what's going on, man.

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:57.487
- Listen Ricci,
come one, man.

01:05:57.554 --> 01:06:00.224
We need to leave.
We need to go. Now, man!

01:06:00.257 --> 01:06:02.559
Listen, I'm ready to run
again, okay?

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:04.428
This ain't right, man.
We gotta go,

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:07.231
I'm ready to go, man.
Let's go, man!

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:22.579
- Ah, man!
What's going on here?

01:06:22.612 --> 01:06:24.314
- Come on, man.
Now this is getting...

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:25.915
This is getting
a little crazy, now.

01:06:25.949 --> 01:06:27.284
This is getting
a little crazy.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:29.953
I just wanna go!
I just wanna go, man.

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:32.289
I just wanna get outta here!

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:33.623
We need to go, man.

01:06:33.623 --> 01:06:36.193
We should've never came
to this homeboy's house.

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:43.033
- We're gonna hear us!
They're gonna hear you!

01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:45.035
I should've never
came here man.

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:48.772
I should never came here.
I just wanna go!

01:06:48.772 --> 01:06:50.374
Listen,
I just wanna go!

01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:52.342
I just wanna go!
I just wanna go!

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.344
I don't care who's
, man.

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:56.146
I just wanna get
out of here!

01:06:56.180 --> 01:07:00.384
- We're going. We're going.
- Guys...

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:11.361
Sssshhhhh!

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.134
- No. No.

01:07:17.134 --> 01:07:21.471
- No. No, man!
Come on, nah! No!

01:07:21.471 --> 01:07:22.706
No!

01:07:32.216 --> 01:07:33.883
I should've never
came to this house.

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.819
We gotta get outta here.

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:50.734
Guys...

01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:55.439
- How'd we end up down here?
- Weren't we just upstairs?

01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:57.674
- How'd we end up down here?

01:07:57.707 --> 01:08:00.177
- We were just up there.

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:02.379
We made a run.
We made a run for the door.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:07.851
So, why are we down here
when we were just up there?

01:08:07.851 --> 01:08:09.953
S-something is weird.

01:08:09.953 --> 01:08:12.356
- Something's going on.
- Something's on.

01:08:12.389 --> 01:08:16.260
- I don't know, man.
I don't know.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:18.627
All I know is
we need to go.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:21.029
I do know that.
We need to go, man.

01:08:21.064 --> 01:08:22.399
I'm telling you.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.935
- Windows.
The door's not workin'.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:30.307
Windows.
You wanna go for windows?

01:08:30.374 --> 01:08:33.643
- You wanna try break a window?
- We should break a window.

01:08:33.643 --> 01:08:35.545
We gotta break a window.

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:37.481
The door ain't working.
- Yeah, right, yeah.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:43.220
- We break this window,

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.822
we could see these twins again.
- He's right.

01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:48.558
- I mean, I've just been down
this dark room,

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:50.426
this black room.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:52.095
Bunch of crazy
stuff going on,

01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:54.331
I'm not going back there.

01:08:54.331 --> 01:08:56.800
- No, he's right.
I've just seen my father,

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.102
I got my ass kicked...

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.505
- I swear to God man,
I swear to God.

01:09:05.509 --> 01:09:08.245
I'm going to the door man.
We just get outta here.

01:09:08.278 --> 01:09:10.613
- Let's do it.
Third's time the charm.

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:13.483
- I'm out. I'm out.

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.432
- Come on.
- Let's get outta here.

01:09:28.432 --> 01:09:30.200
Let's go.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:40.042
A passerby minds his business.

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:50.118
A passerby minds his business.

01:09:50.118 --> 01:10:00.129
A passerby minds his business.

01:10:00.129 --> 01:10:10.139
A passerby minds his business.

01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:17.314
A passerby minds his business.

01:12:08.458 --> 01:12:17.467
I'm almost out.

01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:48.458
What was that?!
What was that?!

01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:50.560
- I don't know.
Let's get outta here, man.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:22.058
Grandfather, are you awake?

01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:25.595
I think he is.
What a long dream you have had.

01:14:25.595 --> 01:14:29.432
Those bad men are gone.
You're back with us now.

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:33.336
Yes. Grandfather,
you had quite the adventure.

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:40.309
Girls! Aww!

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:42.746
How are my pretty darlings
enjoying their afternoon

01:14:42.779 --> 01:14:44.013
with Grandfather?

01:14:44.013 --> 01:14:46.115
- Hi, Aunt Jenny
and Uncle Stanley.

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:48.284
- Auntie, we missed you
so horribly!

01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:50.587
Aww!

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:52.421
Smashing, Grandpa!

01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:54.257
Oh, boy!
He's looking jolly good,

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:55.859
isn't he Jenny?
- Oh, yes!

01:14:55.859 --> 01:14:57.260
- Oh, boy! Better and better

01:14:57.293 --> 01:14:59.262
- every day!
- Mm-hmm!

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:01.464
- I tell you.
Well, I'm hungry!

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:04.668
How 'bout a nice steak, huh?
Tummy's rumbling.

01:15:04.668 --> 01:15:07.003
I'll go to the kitchen
and fix us some nice steak

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:09.105
and maybe a niff
from the ol' bottle

01:15:09.138 --> 01:15:13.610
wouldn't be so bad,
eh Granpa?

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:16.145
Girls, you are both
so thoughtful

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:17.380
looking after
your grandfather

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:19.883
this way after his stroke.

01:15:19.883 --> 01:15:21.184
Dad, you're lucky to have

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:23.519
such granddaughters
in your life.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:25.188
Tomorrow, Uncle Stanley
and I will go

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:27.290
to the country side.

01:15:27.323 --> 01:15:29.058
What do you say about
looking after

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:31.628
dear old Grandfather again?

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:34.230
- Certainly.
- Our pleasure Aunt Jenny.

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:36.966
Oh, splendid!

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.169
Oh, well, I do really.
It's tea time.

01:15:40.169 --> 01:15:42.672
Would you darlings
like some tea?

01:15:42.672 --> 01:15:45.141
- Yes, please.

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:49.679
Be back shortly.
Keep an eye on Grandpa.

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:55.084
Did you hear that,
Grandfather?

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:57.386
We're going to take care
of you tomorrow.

01:15:57.386 --> 01:16:00.423
How about another
adventure tomorrow?

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:03.993
Yes, how about
another adventure,

01:16:03.993 --> 01:16:08.497
where you wake up suddenly
after 20 years of sleeping

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:10.900
and we're all alone
in this house?

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:14.237
Brilliant, Blair.
He can be the caretaker

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:16.005
of an abandoned house
and he fights off

01:16:16.039 --> 01:16:18.274
the evil spirits.

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:22.078
Grandfather, you didn't save us
in our last journey.

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:24.247
You let the robbers
wake us up.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:26.182
You'll have to pay for that.

01:16:26.215 --> 01:16:30.053
Yes, you'll have to pay
for that dearly, you see?

01:16:30.053 --> 01:16:33.556
Let's see how well
you do on the next one.

01:16:33.556 --> 01:16:36.760
They're gonna torture you
and burn you.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.763
And we will be watching you
closely, Grandfather.

01:16:39.763 --> 01:16:44.701
I can smell your flesh
already burning.

01:16:44.734 --> 01:16:48.537
You don't want to be
a bad grandpa, do you?

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:50.774
We will take care of you,
Grandfather.

01:16:50.774 --> 01:16:53.643
Tomorrow, and the day after,

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:57.613
and the day after,
and the day after.
