01:07.360 --> 01:09.385
You walk here?

01:10.720 --> 01:13.143
Alright, good. Turn around.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.310
Legs out.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.790
The bag.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.999
Gotta still hit the
farmers' market.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.479
- What time is it?
- 10:00-ish.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.959
- It's 10:00?
- Mm-hm.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.199
I gotta pick up the kid.
Where's Tony?

01:42.200 --> 01:45.359
Tony and I were out late last night.
But don't worry, he's gonna be here.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.839
- You got this?
- Yes.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.830
He's not gonna flake. Neither am I.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.399
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

01:53.400 --> 01:55.079
- Yes, Chef.
- Wake up.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.599
We got a critic coming today.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.439
Why you think I slept
here for, bro?

01:58.440 --> 02:00.839
Let's get going on the soup.
We're behind on the egg prep.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.839
And get the mise on the steak.
You still shitfaced?

02:02.840 --> 02:04.399
- No, I'm good. I'm good, Chef.
- Alright.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.439
Help Martin with the pig.
We got the pig.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.430
Lechon!

02:13.200 --> 02:15.702
- Hey, pal.
- Hey.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.399
Buckle up, buddy. Sorry I'm late.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.079
I'm used to it.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.639
Listen, pal, I don't think we
have time to catch a movie today.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.679
Is it 'cause you're
getting reviewed?

02:25.680 --> 02:28.359
- Yeah, how'd you know about that?
- Mom told me.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.919
What'd she say?

02:29.920 --> 02:31.999
She said you might
be a little worried.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.919
- She said I was worried?
- Yeah.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.359
Well, Mom doesn't know
me that well, OK?

02:36.360 --> 02:38.719
- She's pretty spot-on about you.
- Oh, yeah?

02:38.720 --> 02:40.559
You know what Mommy
thinks I should be doing?

02:40.560 --> 02:42.159
- What?
- That I should get a food truck.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.999
- I like food trucks.
- Yeah, I like food trucks.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.479
Who doesn't like food trucks?

02:45.480 --> 02:47.719
Can you picture me driving
a food truck? I'm a chef.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.839
- I work in a restaurant.
- OK.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.559
Listen, I gotta go to the farmers'
market, pick up some ingredients.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.999
OK. Can I come?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.839
I thought I'd drop you
off at the restaurant.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.439
- Molly's there.
- No, I wanna go with you.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.359
- You're not gonna ask me
for everything you see?
- No.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.279
It's not about you eating,
it's about me buying groceries.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.719
- I know.
- OK. Good.

03:03.720 --> 03:05.319
- You got the purple and white?
- Just orange.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.159
Just orange? Alright, give
me six bunches of those.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.639
- Or eight of the small.
- Dad.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.679
Hang on a second, buddy. And on the
radishes here, I use the tops, OK?

03:11.680 --> 03:13.159
- I need consistent tops.
- Dad.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.559
Is that what's happening?
Six of these. Let's see what we got.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.039
- Dad.
- What do you want, Percy?

03:17.040 --> 03:19.239
- Can I please have kettle corn?
- Daddy's working, OK?

03:19.240 --> 03:20.719
No, you're not gonna get kettle...

03:20.720 --> 03:23.119
- Why don't you get a piece of fruit?
- I don't want fruit.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.719
How can you even ask for kettle corn?
You know what it is?

03:25.720 --> 03:28.239
- No.
- It's carbs covered with sugar, OK?

03:28.240 --> 03:29.919
Look at this piece of fruit.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.559
Huh? It's beautiful.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.039
How could you even want kettle corn

03:33.040 --> 03:34.879
with gorgeous fruit like
this in front of you?

03:34.880 --> 03:36.519
Why don't you have
a piece of fruit?

03:36.520 --> 03:39.439
So apparently they're
sending a big reviewer

03:39.440 --> 03:41.319
who's also some huge food blogger.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.399
- You know what a food blogger is?
- Yeah.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.759
A guy who writes about
food on the internet.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.399
I know what a food blogger is.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.799
Well, this guy's a big one,
and a lot of these big guys,

03:50.800 --> 03:52.279
they don't like me.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.319
They got it in for me because I got
good write-ups when I started out.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.239
- They're haters.
- Exactly.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.239
We didn't have that word
when I was growing up.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.719
There was no word for hater.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.959
The most you would say is that
somebody was, like, jealous,

04:03.960 --> 04:05.439
which didn't really capture it.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.639
The sausage guy's here.
You ever try andouille sausage?

04:07.640 --> 04:09.119
- No.
- It's spicy.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.559
- You like spicy?
- No.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.505
It's not so spicy. Come on.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.759
That's from New Orleans.
You ever heard of New Orleans?

04:15.760 --> 04:17.238
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

04:17.240 --> 04:18.719
It's part of the United States.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.358
It's part of the Louisiana
Purchase from Napoleon.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.879
Yeah. Um, that was...

04:22.880 --> 04:25.679
I mean, like, now. That
was a long time ago.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.239
- 1803.
- Whatever.

04:28.240 --> 04:31.319
Talking about the food,
the culture, you know?

04:31.320 --> 04:33.679
Like this andouille sausage.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.239
- Beignets. You ever hear of that?
- We can get it here.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.719
Not the same.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.119
When you have it here, it's
good because it reminds you of,

04:40.120 --> 04:43.039
like, a whole world of memories
that you have of being there.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.919
'Cause it's like... I'm telling you,
it's like a whole different world.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.999
- We should go there sometime.
- Definitely.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.919
- For real?
- Yeah.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.599
I mean, not now.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.079
- But, like...
- When?

04:53.080 --> 04:55.867
I don't know. I got...
Everything's very full for me.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.959
- I got this reviewer coming.
- After the review?

04:58.960 --> 05:01.199
Yeah, after review. That'd be good.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.839
I'm off school next month.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.959
Next month? Yeah.
We could go next month.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.439
- Awesome.
- Or whatever. Or, like, if you're...

05:06.440 --> 05:07.919
If it doesn't... I'll ask Mom.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.919
If it doesn't work out next
month, we'll go later.

05:09.920 --> 05:13.071
- But we'll definitely check it out.
- I already did. She's cool with it.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.599
- You asked her already?
- Mm-hm.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.999
Where'd you get a phone? How
come you have a phone already?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.519
Everybody your age have phones?

05:20.520 --> 05:22.479
Yo, Popeye, get the
sauce on there, OK?

05:22.480 --> 05:25.479
Whose bacon is this, huh?
I gotta watch this too?

05:25.480 --> 05:28.519
When I find out who it is, grab your
ankles, 'cause here comes papi chulo.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.959
Where we at? Talk to me,
people. How we doing?

05:30.960 --> 05:32.959
The stock's simmering, the pig's
broken down, bacon are fine.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.719
The stock is simmering.
That means reducing.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.799
Good. Guys, big night tonight.
You all know what's happening?

05:37.800 --> 05:39.799
Yeah? OK, let me know
as soon as he's here.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.799
I want people having fun
at all the tables around.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.599
Call your pretty friends, bring 'em in.
Tell 'em the tickets are on me.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.199
The stemware looks crooked.
Let's get out there.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.199
Don't make me get the fucking
ruler out. Thank you.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.679
- Oh, Chef.
- I got the good shit.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.679
- You see this, Martin?
- Look at that. That's a specimen.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.519
- Baby carrots.
- I got you curry paste with...

05:53.520 --> 05:55.279
- Copy that. Copy that.
- Carl.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.759
Not right now, please.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.599
Where the fuck did you get
these juicy-ass tomatoes?

05:58.600 --> 06:00.943
- Riva's here.
- OK, you got it? Let's get...

06:01.680 --> 06:03.159
What the hell's Riva doing here?

06:03.160 --> 06:05.159
I don't know. He was
on his way back here.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.319
I got him espresso, bought
you five minutes of time.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.919
You should meet him
out on the floor.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.319
Stall him for five minutes. Let
me get the staff going. Please.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.559
OK. Fine. Expect him
to come back here.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.039
Yeah, thank you.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.039
How you gonna keep that
psychopath from coming back here?

06:17.040 --> 06:19.279
- You gotta have a plan.
- You want me to pickle these?

06:19.280 --> 06:20.879
Yeah, pickle these.
I want you to pickle...

06:20.880 --> 06:22.359
- Is Carl in there?
- Yeah.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.639
Hey, Carl!

06:24.640 --> 06:26.479
Carl.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.199
Are you, uh... are you
planning on altering the menu?

06:30.200 --> 06:32.159
Yeah, I can't do this right
now. Please, just...

06:32.160 --> 06:34.399
- You know a lot is on the line today.
- I know.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.999
That's why the menu
has to be perfect.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.599
- But I can help you plan it.
- I can't do this right now.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.159
Give me five minutes with my staff,
I'll walk you through the menu.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.959
I've done this before.
I can help guide you.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.111
I don't need guidance
right now. I need space.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.119
OK?

06:48.120 --> 06:50.110
Thank you.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.946
Could we have a little
privacy, uh, guys?

06:54.440 --> 06:56.559
Huh?

06:56.560 --> 06:59.142
I ask you to leave,
you gotta look at Carl?

06:59.720 --> 07:02.239
OK, everybody, tomen cinco.
Take five.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.719
- You good?
- I got it. Go, go, go.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.790
Grab a coffee.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.039
- Let's get something straight.
- Yeah.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.839
You don't fucking talk to my
staff like that. I talk to my staff.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.079
That side of the pass is
you, this side is me.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.719
That was the arrangement
when you hired me.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.719
OK, now will you listen
to me for a minute?

07:19.720 --> 07:22.559
Carl, I get ideas.
Sometimes my ideas work.

07:22.560 --> 07:26.079
I really don't care what magazine
said that you're the next big thing.

07:26.080 --> 07:29.519
The fact is, you work for me,
in my restaurant, right?

07:29.520 --> 07:31.359
I've had chefs before
you in this kitchen.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.799
- I'll have chefs after you. OK?
- Alright, good talk.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.039
- Let me get back to work.
- You know who's coming tonight.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.359
We're being reviewed by the most
important critic in the city.

07:38.360 --> 07:41.999
- Yes. I'm aware.
- His online blog was sold to AOL...

07:42.000 --> 07:43.519
- For $10 million.
- That's right.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.159
- You knew that?
- Yes, I know.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.679
- OK.
- He's a big deal.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.799
- That's why I wanna cook a good menu.
- You wanna cook a good menu?

07:49.800 --> 07:52.199
- I wanna cook him some good food.
- Yeah. Well, then...

07:52.200 --> 07:54.479
And our place is in a
fucking creative rut.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.479
- In a rut?
- In a creative rut.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.879
You do know we're doing better than
any place in the neighbourhood?

07:58.880 --> 08:00.719
I'm not talking about how
much money we're making,

08:00.720 --> 08:02.559
I'm talking about creatively...
the food that we're serving.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.159
We've served the same
food for five years.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.199
Remember what happened when
you put guts on the menu?

08:06.200 --> 08:08.559
Are you talking about my sweetbreads?
Is that what you mean?

08:08.560 --> 08:11.279
Yeah. When you put that artsy shit
on the menu, people don't like it.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.159
Not one person ordered
your sweetbreads.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.679
Please listen to me.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.039
I sank a fortune into the remodel
to get you the French cooking top,

08:19.040 --> 08:20.519
whatever it is, that tabletop.

08:20.520 --> 08:21.999
- French cooking suite.
- Right.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.199
Not every chef gets that.
You know why you get it?

08:24.200 --> 08:25.639
- I appreciate it.
- Do you know why?

08:25.640 --> 08:27.119
Because you deserve it.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.159
See, you don't know that.
But I know it.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.759
You deserve it.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.719
So be smart just for tonight.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.679
Look, if you bought Stones tickets

08:34.679 --> 08:38.318
and Jagger didn't play
'Satisfaction', how would you feel?

08:38.320 --> 08:40.039
Would you be happy?

08:40.039 --> 08:41.519
- No.
- No!

08:41.520 --> 08:44.341
You'd burn the place
to the fucking ground.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.119
Your menu works.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.304
People love it.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.079
Carl, do what you want tonight.
OK? You're the chef.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.959
You know what I think?

08:55.960 --> 08:58.030
I think you should play your hits.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.119
Alright, let's go. Pre-shift, guys.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.919
Big night tonight.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.959
Here's what we're doing.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.279
We're gonna go with the favourites.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.623
Starting with the caviar egg...

09:14.400 --> 09:17.187
scallop, French onion soup...

09:17.680 --> 09:19.670
frisée salad...

09:20.200 --> 09:22.304
lobster risotto...

09:22.840 --> 09:24.519
filet.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.639
And we're gonna finish
strong with a crowd pleaser,

09:26.640 --> 09:28.679
chocolate lava cake.

09:28.680 --> 09:31.079
Talk to Molly about wine pairings.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.319
Let me know when he gets here.
And let's have fun.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.719
Put your heart in it, people,
big night. Let's have some fun.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.710
Good, good.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.519
<i>I'm so tired of being alone</i>

09:49.520 --> 09:52.159
<i>I'm so tired of on-my-own</i>

09:52.160 --> 09:59.279
<i>Won't you help me, girl,
just as soon as you can?</i>

09:59.280 --> 10:04.159
<i>People say that I've found a way</i>

10:04.160 --> 10:10.359
<i>To make you say that you love me</i>

10:10.360 --> 10:13.039
<i>Hey, baby, you didn't go for that</i>

10:13.040 --> 10:15.941
<i>It's a natural fact</i>

10:16.560 --> 10:18.439
<i>That I wanna come back</i>

10:18.440 --> 10:20.908
<i>Show me where it's at</i>

10:21.800 --> 10:23.559
<i>Baby, yeah</i>

10:23.560 --> 10:26.799
<i>I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired...</i>

10:26.800 --> 10:28.679
Dad.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.679
Dad.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.467
Dad! Come on. Let's go.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.079
Look! It's up, it's up. It's up,
it's up. The review's up.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.639
To the review. Here we go.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.239
- To you, baby, to you.
- Here we go.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.310
- My culinary hero.
- To the team.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.439
"Gauloises - eager to please."

10:52.440 --> 10:53.999
- Whoo!
- Yes!

10:54.000 --> 10:56.199
"10 years ago, I had the
good fortune to dine

10:56.200 --> 10:59.279
"at Chef Casper's revelatory
Miami bistro, Marrow."

10:59.280 --> 11:00.839
- Miami in the house!
- Marrow, baby!

11:00.840 --> 11:02.319
That's your house!

11:02.320 --> 11:06.519
"The sheer audacity of this fresh,
brave voice of the culinary scene

11:06.520 --> 11:10.039
"reminded me why I write
about food as a vocation."

11:10.040 --> 11:11.879
- Yeah!
- That's a lot of pressure.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.119
"It is nearly impossible to separate
my glowing regard for Chef Casper

11:15.120 --> 11:19.199
"and how much he inspired me from my
expectations as I sat down to dine

11:19.200 --> 11:22.399
"at the recently remodelled
Brentwood Gallic staple, Gauloises."

11:22.400 --> 11:25.824
- Yeah, this is good!
- "Oh, how times have changed.

11:26.880 --> 11:31.199
"Over the last decade, Carl Casper has
somehow managed to transform himself

11:31.200 --> 11:33.399
"from the edgiest chef in Miami

11:33.400 --> 11:37.439
"to the needy aunt that gives
you $5 every time you see her

11:37.440 --> 11:39.039
"in hopes that you will like her,

11:39.040 --> 11:41.799
"but instead causes you to
shrink from her cloying embrace

11:41.800 --> 11:46.066
"which threatens to smother you
in her saggy, moist cleavage.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.039
"The signature app,

11:48.040 --> 11:51.279
"intended to impress the
country club brunch crowd,

11:51.280 --> 11:53.544
"is the caviar egg.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.119
"A shirred egg topped
with a dollop of caviar

11:56.120 --> 11:59.039
"is an excuse for the
chef to overcharge us

11:59.040 --> 12:02.350
"for his insecurity and
lack of imagination.

12:03.160 --> 12:06.919
"Carl Casper can best be summed
up by the first bite of his needy

"and yet by some miracle
also irrelevant

"chocolate lava cake.

12:11.720 --> 12:16.999
"Casper didn't even have the
courage to undercook the cake,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.159
"thus curiously lacking its
signature molten centre."

12:21.320 --> 12:22.799
"This sad dessert is emblematic

12:22.800 --> 12:25.507
"of Carl Casper's
disappointing new chapter.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.519
"His dramatic... weight
gain can only be explained

12:29.520 --> 12:31.119
"by the fact that he must be eating

12:31.120 --> 12:34.039
"all the food sent
back to the kitchen."

12:34.040 --> 12:36.144
Two stars.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.599
I don't get it. I don't get it.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.799
Everyone loved it.
He loved it, even.

12:43.800 --> 12:47.119
Then Why'd he write all that mean
shit about me? About my food?

12:47.120 --> 12:49.559
Who cares? Who cares?

12:49.560 --> 12:51.159
I do. 'Cause I could
have done better.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.159
I should have cooked the
shit I was gonna cook.

12:53.160 --> 12:56.999
You're ignoring the fact
that everyone was happy

12:57.000 --> 13:00.399
and you're making a problem
where there's no problem.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.959
It's not hard to make people happy.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.599
There's certain things you could put on
a menu that'll make everybody happy.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.159
If you put ahi tuna on a
menu, it will sell out.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.879
It's guaranteed. You know that.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.399
But I cooked the beef cheek,
which is a better dish,

13:11.400 --> 13:12.879
and nobody wants to even try it.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.319
- It was good, though.
- Yeah, for family meal.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.879
Well, who you cooking for, though?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.719
That's my point.
Why do I have to pick?

13:18.720 --> 13:21.639
Why do I have to choose?
Why can't I have both?

13:21.640 --> 13:24.599
There are chefs that cook
food that they believe in

13:24.600 --> 13:27.279
and people will try because
they're open to a new experience

13:27.280 --> 13:28.799
and they'll end up liking it.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.039
- What do you want me to say to you?
- The truth.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.279
You want me to tell you
that you're the best chef

13:33.280 --> 13:35.039
that I ever worked with.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.839
And it's true, because you are.

13:36.840 --> 13:39.239
You are, Carl. You are the best
chef I've ever worked with.

13:39.240 --> 13:41.279
- OK.
- I mean it.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.479
Well, thank you.

13:43.480 --> 13:45.470
You're welcome.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.999
- We both agreed not to do that.
- I know.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.279
Why don't I just
cook you something?

13:53.280 --> 13:55.759
Oh, OK. Fuck it. Let's go.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.879
Mmm!

14:57.880 --> 14:59.905
Mom wants to talk to you.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.401
Inez?

15:08.800 --> 15:10.799
Inez.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.279
Are you OK?

15:18.280 --> 15:19.839
I got two stars.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.759
Getting two stars is good, right?

15:21.760 --> 15:23.999
I mean, I don't read that
shit normally, but, you know,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.239
then he starts writing all this
personal shit about me and...

15:26.240 --> 15:28.479
How many people you got working?
You got, like, 50 people.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.719
And Percy's 10 years old.
Does he still need a nanny?

15:30.720 --> 15:33.359
He's in school all day. What does
she even do here? Hi, Flora.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.199
- Hi, Mr Carl.
- I mean, what does he need...

15:35.200 --> 15:38.146
- What's she doing here?
- You know that he's hurt, right?

15:38.920 --> 15:41.719
Because I was late? I already
apologised to him. We're fine.

15:41.720 --> 15:45.359
Late? He waited for you for
one hour alone outside.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.959
Well, I didn't realise
it was that long.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.064
It's just... that
was the day that...

15:49.680 --> 15:51.159
You're right.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.708
I didn't like what
they wrote about you.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.390
I didn't like it either.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.599
It hurt, alright?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.989
You OK?

16:06.080 --> 16:08.070
I'm alright.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.199
Good.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.279
I'm gonna make it up to him.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.399
- That was fun, right?
- Yeah.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.359
- Where you going?
- I gotta work on a menu.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.239
It's still early. Can I watch?

16:22.240 --> 16:23.759
Yeah, sorry, it's at work.

16:23.760 --> 16:26.079
- I won't get in the way.
- Yeah, I gotta go work.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.159
- OK. 'Bye.
- We'll have fun next week.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.199
OK.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.199
What the hell are you doing here,
man? What's this madness, huh?

17:46.200 --> 17:47.719
- This is crazy.
- Yeah.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.199
- You didn't go home, did you?
- No.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.799
- Come here. Check it out.
- Go home, man.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.639
- You've been here all night. Go home.
- Come here.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.639
Get some sleep. Fuck Twitter.
Come on, get outta here.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.479
"Fuck Twitter"? What are you
talking about, "Fuck Twitter"?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.479
I mean, you know, fuck 'em.
That's what I mean.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.319
- Who reads that shit anyhow?
- I'm not on Twitter.

18:00.320 --> 18:01.799
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.319
Nothing. Just classic bullshit.
What is that?

18:04.320 --> 18:06.504
- That's carne asada. Check it out.
- Wow.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.359
Wow!

18:10.360 --> 18:12.319
- Good?
- It's fucking unbelievable, man.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.359
- Is it?
- Holy shit!

18:14.360 --> 18:16.359
- No, seriously.
- No, I'm serious.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.199
- Tell me the truth.
- I'm telling you the truth.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.839
- It's incredible.
- Is it good seasoning?

18:19.840 --> 18:21.319
- The seasoning's perfect.
- Roll that shit!

18:21.320 --> 18:23.199
Chef Big Dog up all night cooking!

18:23.200 --> 18:24.679
- Come on in, buddy.
- Come here.

18:24.680 --> 18:27.119
- Tony, check this out.
- Shut up and taste this, amuse douche.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.110
- Come here.
- What we got?

18:31.920 --> 18:33.399
- Wow.
- It's good?

18:33.400 --> 18:35.359
Huh? Look at that.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.159
- Too much heat?
- That's perfect, Chef.

18:37.160 --> 18:38.679
- It's good? Seasoning?
- Oh, it's perfect.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.159
- It's nice and spicy.
- You like it?

18:40.160 --> 18:41.879
- Oh, man.
- Ha, jefe? Look at that.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.039
- I do.
- Yeah?

18:44.040 --> 18:45.559
- It's fucking great.
- Is it good?

18:45.560 --> 18:47.159
- Don't fuck with me.
- But it's so good.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.239
- See, jefe? I told you.
- It's flavourful as fuck, man.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.839
- It's nice, right?
- Umm.

18:50.840 --> 18:53.627
- Is it good?
- Yo, Big Dog, fuck Twitter.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.799
"Fuck Twitter". Again
with the "Fuck Twitter".

18:55.800 --> 18:57.279
Why should I fuck Twitter?

18:57.280 --> 18:59.479
- You're not on Twitter?
- No.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.279
You're getting too much pussy?
Is that the problem?

19:01.280 --> 19:02.759
It's gotta be, right?

19:02.760 --> 19:04.359
What does Twitter have
to do with pussy?

19:04.360 --> 19:06.879
Have you not heard of the
term 'social networking'?

19:06.880 --> 19:08.359
- Yeah.
- Well, that's what it is.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.319
- It means pussy?
- Like, pussy.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.479
Or, like, getting
tickets to something.

19:12.480 --> 19:15.479
- Or finding about a new band.
- Flash mobs. That kind of stuff.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.639
- Anything that requires a database.
- So pussy requires a database?

19:18.640 --> 19:20.599
Yeah!

19:20.600 --> 19:23.865
So show me what's on Twitter
that's so bad that I should see.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.399
- Oh, shit, is that gochujang?
- Nothing. Nothing.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.919
- Damn, you made fucking gochujang?
- Yeah, that's under the squab.

19:28.920 --> 19:31.319
But he's gonna 86 it.
Riva's gonna 86 it, I know.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.479
- Yo, this gochujang is good.
- Don't worry about fucking Riva.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.319
He ain't gonna let you
serve that Korean shit.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.599
Let me handle him. Don't
worry about that. I got it.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.239
He says I can cook whatever I want.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.079
- Alright. Alright.
- We're gonna cook like this.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.799
- Did you try that? Oh, hey.
- Oh, man.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.359
That's broccoli rabe
l'anchois. Check this out.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.119
This is ridiculous.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.384
- What you got over there?
- I got...

20:38.400 --> 20:41.199
- Mom cuts off the crust.
- Yeah, well, I don't.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.919
- It's good.
- You bet your ass it's good.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.479
Can you turn that down, please?

20:49.480 --> 20:51.279
Oh, sorry.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.111
Arrgh!

20:54.960 --> 20:56.439
You know about Twitter?

20:56.440 --> 20:58.669
- Yeah, I have an account.
- Yeah?

20:59.160 --> 21:01.559
- How's it work?
- It's cool.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.399
It's cool? That's how
it works, it's cool?

21:03.400 --> 21:05.639
- You tweet on it.
- Is that like texting?

21:05.640 --> 21:07.279
No.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.719
- Sign me up.
- OK.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.839
So, what do you want
your username to be?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.319
Carl.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.919
You can't just put Carl.
It has to be 'at something'.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.759
At Carl Casper.

21:20.760 --> 21:23.706
@CarlCasper.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.350
- Taken.
- Someone took my name?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.959
@ChefCarlCasper? Is that cool?

21:29.960 --> 21:31.639
Yeah, that's good.

21:31.640 --> 21:34.871
At... Chef...

21:35.560 --> 21:37.919
Carl... Casper.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.639
So is this for sex?

21:39.640 --> 21:41.479
Eww! Is that what
you're doing this for?

21:41.480 --> 21:43.719
No, I'm not doing it for that.
Someone wrote something bad.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.319
I wanna see what they wrote.

21:45.320 --> 21:46.839
Good.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.679
Oh, shit.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.879
Hey. You can't talk like that.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.679
I don't care if Mommy's not around.
I don't want you cursing around here.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.919
- That review went viral.
- What does that mean?

21:56.920 --> 21:58.999
It means it got picked up
and re-tweeted everywhere.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.999
So all these people
have read the review?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.759
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.879
- I think it's kinda cool.
- I don't.

22:05.880 --> 22:08.319
- No, I mean, us doing this.
- Doing what?

22:08.320 --> 22:09.839
You know, just hanging out.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.319
We hang out all the time.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.948
No, like, hanging out
and doing something.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.119
Well, we do things.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.479
No, not just, like, watching
something or doing something.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.759
Like, hanging out and talking.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.479
And learning things
from each other.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.479
I figured, you know, with
you living at Mom's house

22:24.480 --> 22:27.679
and me working all the time, when we
hung out, you liked to do fun things.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.679
I think this is kinda fun.
You know, just figuring stuff out.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.830
Like when you lived at home.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.790
Yeah, I miss that too.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.390
Then why don't you move back home?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.070
Percy, I can't just...

22:43.360 --> 22:46.279
You're not the reason that I'm not
living at home. You know that, right?

22:46.280 --> 22:47.879
- Mm-hm.
- 'Cause it's true.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.919
- Then why?
- Then why what?

22:49.920 --> 22:52.502
Well, why don't you live home?

22:54.320 --> 22:56.639
Well, Mommy and Daddy, you know,

22:56.640 --> 23:00.559
we... we both grew apart,
in different directions.

23:00.560 --> 23:02.679
But we're still
really good friends.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.919
It's just better if we don't
live in the same house.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.719
- And that we're not married.
- Oh.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.759
- You understand?
- No.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.944
It's hard to explain.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.439
Hey, listen, could we twitter each other
when we're not in the same place?

23:15.440 --> 23:17.319
- Yeah.
- Could you show me how to do that?

23:17.320 --> 23:19.799
Yeah. OK.

23:19.800 --> 23:23.622
So, first you click here and you
have to enter your username.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.959
- Right.
- You could also log in on your iPhone.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.439
Uh-huh.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.279
You click this button here,

23:29.280 --> 23:31.759
it posts your feed so all
your followers can read it.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.310
OK.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.999
- Dad?
- Yeah.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.199
You got 1,653 followers
since last night.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.279
- Oh, is that good?
- It's amazing.

25:58.280 --> 26:01.119
Oh, good. What does it mean?

26:01.120 --> 26:05.159
It means that 1,653 people are
reading your Twitter feed.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.719
Mm-hm. I thought it
was like texting.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.719
Did you post anything
since last night?

26:10.720 --> 26:12.599
- No.
- Are you sure?

26:12.600 --> 26:15.079
Yeah, I just sent a private
message to somebody.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.999
- To who?
- To that A-hole food critic.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.239
You could only send private messages
to people who are following you.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.279
I think you might have
posted that publicly.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.879
No, he wrote something nasty
about me and then I hit reply

26:25.880 --> 26:27.719
and it let me send
a message to him.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.639
Dad, replies are public.
Everybody can read them.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.279
And it looks like he re-tweeted it

26:32.280 --> 26:39.279
to all his 123,845 followers.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.430
And he wrote back.

26:41.920 --> 26:43.910
What did he say?

26:44.840 --> 26:46.439
- I don't think I should read it.
- Just...

26:46.440 --> 26:48.319
Can you read it to me, please?

26:48.320 --> 26:50.549
Read the reply.

26:51.840 --> 26:54.519
"@ChefCarlCasper...

26:54.520 --> 26:57.479
"I would rather have
you sit on my face

26:57.480 --> 27:00.959
"after a brisk walk on a warm day

27:00.960 --> 27:04.191
"than suffer through that
fucking lava cake again."

27:08.640 --> 27:10.359
He wrote that to me?

27:10.360 --> 27:12.544
He wrote it to everybody.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.079
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Wow.

27:16.080 --> 27:17.679
You realise how many
people have read this?

27:17.680 --> 27:19.559
I'm up to 2,000 followers
since last night.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.399
- You're trending, bro.
- They're sending me messages.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.119
They're goading me into
responding to this prick.

27:23.120 --> 27:25.359
- Don't do it. Don't do it, man.
- Don't do that, Chef.

27:25.360 --> 27:26.959
- Don't respond. Take the high road.
- I know.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.559
But half the people
are saying he's right.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.399
Yeah, but half the people
are saying he's wrong.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.199
- That's the fucking internet.
- That's right. Listen to him.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.399
- That's social media. You on Twitter?
- Yeah, I'm Twitter.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.079
- What's your name?
- Little Marty.

27:36.080 --> 27:38.879
But all the people following me,
I don't wanna hang out during the day.

27:38.880 --> 27:41.039
I avoid all... Oh, hey, hey,
hey, what are you doing?

27:41.040 --> 27:42.519
- This guy.
- Don't. What are you writing?

27:42.520 --> 27:43.999
Chef, don't... That's
not a good idea.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.839
Just listen. I won't send it
until we all say it's OK.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.559
"Why don't you come
by again tonight?

27:48.560 --> 27:50.559
"I got a whole new menu
just for you, asshole."

27:50.560 --> 27:52.799
- No, gimme the phone.
- That's not good. Not a good idea.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.679
Don't do it!

27:55.080 --> 27:56.519
- That's out there now, bro.
- It happened.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.319
- Why'd you do that?
- You can't take that back.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.359
You know what? I threw
down the gauntlet.

28:00.360 --> 28:01.839
So get ready for a fight.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.639
I'm gonna go drop Percy
off and come back

28:03.640 --> 28:05.439
and cook the menu we
should've cooked last time.

28:05.440 --> 28:08.119
- So where are we going today?
- I gotta drop you off, kid.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.159
I gotta go shopping for
tonight. I'm sorry.

28:10.160 --> 28:13.159
- Can I come with you?
- No, I'm sorry.

28:13.160 --> 28:16.559
How come I'm, like, never
allowed to be in the kitchen?

28:16.560 --> 28:19.359
Because it's hot and it's loud and
there's a lot of bad language.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.159
So? I hear bad
language all the time.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.319
- Where?
- Online.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.959
What kind of website could a 10-year-old
get on that has bad language?

28:25.960 --> 28:28.239
- YouTube.
- YouTube has bad language?

28:28.240 --> 28:29.839
Could I at least come
shopping with you?

28:29.840 --> 28:31.319
No.

28:31.320 --> 28:34.505
I got a lot to do and
a lot on my mind.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.707
Look who's waiting for us.
Hi, Mommy.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.679
Come here. I miss you.
Give me a kiss.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.599
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.879
So my publicist said that
she can talk to you.

28:47.880 --> 28:49.639
- Why don't you talk to her?
- About what?

28:49.640 --> 28:52.599
- About Twitter?
- Everybody's reading what you wrote.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.919
- I don't think you get it.
- Get what?

28:54.920 --> 28:57.582
Let's call her. Go inside
with me and we'll call her.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.559
Yes, please, tell her
to call me immediately.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.079
I have Carl with me.
I'm at home. Thank you.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.399
- Alright, I'm gonna go.
- No, no, she's gonna call right back.

29:05.400 --> 29:08.439
- She was on the other line.
- You're making more of this than it is.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.279
I just don't like to
see you like this.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.279
Like what? I'm fine.
I have to get to work.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.279
You're never going to be happy
cooking for someone else.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.919
Is this about the food truck?
I don't wanna talk about it again.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.919
Why not? You can cook your own
food. You can be your own boss.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.159
I can book you for all the
parties that I'm doing.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.159
I appreciate the offer, but
I don't need any charity

29:24.160 --> 29:25.639
from you or your ex-husband.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.919
- Why are you being so proud?
- Because I'm working.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.399
And despite what you might think,

29:29.400 --> 29:31.559
I have complete freedom to
cook whatever I want now.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.039
I like my life.

29:33.040 --> 29:36.039
And as far as your publicist goes,
when she calls back, you let her know

29:36.040 --> 29:38.239
that I understand I shouldn't
tweet any pictures of my dick

29:38.240 --> 29:40.039
and any career advice
should be kept to oneself.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.479
OK? I'll see you later. Thank you.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.119
- I got all this shit in the trunk.
- Want me to do this?

29:44.120 --> 29:45.559
- Is it on?
- Yeah. We're doing it.

29:45.560 --> 29:47.559
- We're doing it, guys.
- Come on. Let's get everything out.

29:47.560 --> 29:51.439
I want the Cambros, the delis
out so we can start plating, OK?

29:51.440 --> 29:53.439
Carl, can you tell me what's
going on for tonight?

29:53.440 --> 29:55.439
No, no, no, how many
covers do we have tonight?

29:55.440 --> 29:58.159
How many? We are overbooked.
But I just printed out all the menus.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.239
Good. It's not the menu you
got printed. It's different.

30:00.240 --> 30:02.079
- That's what I understand.
- We're doing a tasting menu.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.879
- Carl, I have to put the wine...
- A tasting menu for Ramsey Michel.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.879
- I know, but we...
- He's coming. He knows about it.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.439
- Did you see the 'Eater' article?
- I did.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.319
- I'm so excited for you.
- It's all over the internet.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.319
- I love it when you're like this.
- Taste the food.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.319
Bring in the waitstaff,
have 'em taste the food.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.759
Make them understand
what we're going for.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.079
- OK.
- OK?

30:17.080 --> 30:19.079
We're not pushing specials today.
The whole menu is special.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.559
- I'm excited.
- I'm excited. I'm finally happy.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.039
I'm happy, OK?

30:23.040 --> 30:25.039
Am I allowed to be happy at work?

30:25.040 --> 30:27.439
Carl. Carl. We're staying
with the same menu, right?

30:27.440 --> 30:29.039
I have something really
good planned for tonight.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.519
I'm gonna let you...
It's not sweetbreads.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.679
- You're gonna be able to taste it.
- That may be true.

30:32.680 --> 30:35.279
But we have the most reservations
on a work night since we opened.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.119
- You realise that?
- I know. I was on Twitter.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.959
- Yeah.
- I was promoting the restaurant.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.999
- I was on Twitter.
- What? Yeah, that's another thing.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.679
From now on, before you post
anything online, I OK it. Alright?

30:44.680 --> 30:46.159
The whole reason
everybody's here tonight

30:46.160 --> 30:47.759
is because I called out
Ramsey Michel online

30:47.760 --> 30:50.159
and they're all coming to
watch me stick it in his ass.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.999
Yeah, and you're gonna
twitter an apology

30:52.000 --> 30:55.399
for calling the most respected
critic in Los Angeles an asshole.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.599
- I'm not gonna fucking apologise.
- What do you mean, you're not...

30:57.600 --> 31:00.079
- You see what he wrote about me?
- I don't give a fuck...

31:00.080 --> 31:01.919
- He started it!
- ..what he wrote. I don't care.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.839
You're a cook. You're a chef.

31:03.840 --> 31:06.519
This is what you've been cooking
for years, and it works.

31:06.520 --> 31:09.799
And either you cook the menu that
our customers have come to ex...

31:09.800 --> 31:12.039
- You want me to cook the same food?
- The same exact...

31:12.040 --> 31:15.279
The same food that he ripped apart?
The same guy who's coming tonight?

31:15.280 --> 31:16.879
The restaurant isn't
filled with critics!

31:16.880 --> 31:18.879
It's filled with people
that've been eating your food

31:18.880 --> 31:21.159
for the last 10 years!

31:21.160 --> 31:22.919
So now, suddenly, you're
gonna be an artist.

31:22.920 --> 31:24.519
Well, be an artist
on your own time.

31:24.520 --> 31:25.999
- Listen to me.
- No sweetbreads!

31:26.000 --> 31:27.439
- Listen!
- No calves' brains.

31:27.440 --> 31:28.919
I'm not cooking sweetbreads!
Listen to me.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.039
The kitchen is my domain.
That was our deal.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.879
I don't give a fuck
what the deal was!

31:32.880 --> 31:35.439
The deal is now changed.
Either you stay or you go.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.147
It's up to you. End of discussion.

31:43.120 --> 31:46.239
- We got a full house of people... - Yeah.
- ..who are coming tonight... - Yeah.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.559
- ..To eat my food.
- No, it's not your food, Carl.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.559
It's not your food.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.799
By definition, it's my food
because it's my restaurant.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.119
I pay for the glasses.
I pay for the napkins.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.759
I pay for the spoons.
I pay for Molly's salary.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.239
I pay for your entire
staff's salary, OK?

32:01.240 --> 32:03.519
So you either cook
my menu or Tony can.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.519
Tony, you've been cooking
it half the time anyway.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.704
Tell the truth. Right?

32:11.560 --> 32:13.039
So you're threatening
to fire me now?

32:13.040 --> 32:14.519
Am I threatening to fire you?

32:14.520 --> 32:16.319
No, I'm telling you
what I'm prepared to do

32:16.320 --> 32:17.999
if you don't cook my menu.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.559
Subject closed.

32:19.560 --> 32:22.279
Well, why don't you cook
the menu without a chef

32:22.280 --> 32:24.319
and we see how it goes tonight?

32:24.320 --> 32:27.824
Let's go, Tony. Fuck this.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.064
Tony.

32:37.560 --> 32:39.039
Good luck.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.519
- Oh, no way.
- Good luck, Jack.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.999
- No way, man!
- Martin, Martin.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.719
- No. Hell, no. Come on.
- You stay. Stay.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.799
Martin, come on. Let me
go, buddy. Don't do it.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.799
Don't do it. Just stay.

32:47.800 --> 32:50.189
- Call me. Call me.
- You'd better believe it, yeah.

32:52.400 --> 32:56.541
Tony, you got a full house
tonight. Be a pro, OK?

33:29.960 --> 33:31.559
Let's go! Get the leg on.
Coming up.

33:31.560 --> 33:33.879
Get that lava cake out, table 22.

33:33.880 --> 33:36.519
Bring that shit back.
Bring that shit back.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.510
This is table 22.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.470
Just a moment, please.

33:47.880 --> 33:51.119
No, no, we gotta chiz this.
You didn't chiz it.

33:51.120 --> 33:53.199
Welcome back.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.239
Lovely to see you again,
Mr Michel. Right this way.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.719
Thank you.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.919
- I hope traffic wasn't too bad.
- No, it wasn't.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.918
- 30, I got one.
- Table 30's still missing the risotto.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.946
What's going on with all
these tickets, man?

34:54.719 --> 34:56.199
Yes? How can I help you?

34:56.199 --> 34:57.839
Isn't this, um...

34:57.840 --> 35:00.799
Wasn't this on the menu
last time I... I... I visited?

35:00.800 --> 35:02.959
I believe it was.

35:02.960 --> 35:06.748
I was under the impression that
tonight was gonna somehow be...

35:07.240 --> 35:09.959
be different, more of an event.

35:09.960 --> 35:11.519
I understand.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.959
Is there something we can do
to make you more comfortable?

35:13.960 --> 35:15.959
Um... could I actually...

35:15.960 --> 35:18.199
Could I speak with the chef?
With Chef Casper?

35:18.200 --> 35:21.919
I have a wonderful '09 that I
just opened to let breathe.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.439
- Um...
- If I may?

35:23.440 --> 35:26.999
The last time I was in
Napa, at the vineyard,

35:27.000 --> 35:29.079
they shipped me this
bottle as a gift,

35:29.080 --> 35:31.679
and I've just been waiting
for the right occasion.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.879
That... that's very
generous of you.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.679
Is Chef Casper here?

35:35.680 --> 35:38.182
Unfortunately, he was called away.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.399
Is he coming back?

35:40.400 --> 35:44.079
I'm afraid that was left ambiguous.

37:21.160 --> 37:24.159
I need you out front. They're three
deep in the bar. Get off the phone.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.359
- Please let me do my job.
- Please go to the bar.

37:26.360 --> 37:28.599
- Tony!
- Carl, I can't talk right now.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.039
- We are in deep weeds.
- This guy's tweeting me.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.519
This guy's calling me out online.
What the fuck are you serving?

37:33.520 --> 37:36.359
I don't know. They're
serving the same shit.

37:36.360 --> 37:37.879
- What's he eating?
- I think he's...

37:37.880 --> 37:39.759
- What course is he on?
- He's...

37:39.760 --> 37:41.839
He's eating the chocolate
lava cake right now.

37:41.840 --> 37:44.079
You just keep him right
where the fuck he is.

37:44.080 --> 37:46.039
- What?!
- I'm parking the car.

37:46.040 --> 37:48.319
- Carl, what?
- Don't let him leave.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.629
Keep the motherfucker there!

37:52.160 --> 37:55.239
Is he here? Is the
fucker still here?

37:55.240 --> 37:57.559
- Oh, fuck.
- Let's go into the back of the house.

37:57.560 --> 38:00.679
I just wanna say one thing. I just
wanna say one thing. Just one thing.

38:00.680 --> 38:02.399
Let's go to the kitchen.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.239
Stop it. Stop it for a second!

38:04.240 --> 38:06.039
Let's just...

38:06.040 --> 38:08.519
I've been waiting to talk to
this prick for a long time.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.959
- OK.
- I am not cloying. I am not needy.

38:10.960 --> 38:12.439
I don't care what you think.

38:12.440 --> 38:15.546
You're not getting to me.
I'm not needy!

38:16.560 --> 38:19.479
Chocolate lava cake is not just
undercooked chocolate cake.

38:19.480 --> 38:21.982
That's not what makes
the centre molten.

38:22.920 --> 38:26.239
You take a frozen cylinder of ganache
and you set it in the ramekin

38:26.240 --> 38:29.079
so that as the outside cooks
fully, the inside becomes molten!

38:29.080 --> 38:30.799
OK. OK.

38:30.800 --> 38:34.907
It's fucking molten, see?
Its fucking molten, you asshole!

38:36.360 --> 38:38.199
And you don't do anything.
What do you do?

38:38.200 --> 38:42.830
You sit and you eat and you
vomit those words back.

38:43.480 --> 38:44.959
To make people laugh.

38:44.960 --> 38:47.279
You know how hard I
work for this shit?

38:47.280 --> 38:49.828
Do you know how hard
my whole staff works?

38:50.560 --> 38:52.479
What sacrifices I make
to make you happy

38:52.480 --> 38:57.079
and then you just smugly just
fucking shit on my shit?

38:57.080 --> 38:59.799
OK.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.479
- It hurts!
- Yes.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.119
It fucking hurts when
you write that shit!

39:03.120 --> 39:05.159
- It hurt you.
- It does. It does.

39:05.160 --> 39:09.279
He was... He thought you were gonna
close his fucking restaurant down!

39:09.280 --> 39:11.509
You asshole!

39:15.240 --> 39:17.719
And what do you? You just
write shit to make...

39:17.720 --> 39:20.599
You just make shit up!
It was molten!

39:20.600 --> 39:23.239
It's fucking molten!

39:23.240 --> 39:24.719
Asshole!

39:24.720 --> 39:27.519
- You're not getting to me.
- OK. OK.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.559
- You're not getting to me!
- OK, Carl.

39:29.560 --> 39:31.239
- He's not getting to me!
- No, he's not.

39:31.240 --> 39:33.199
I know, but you're a publicist.
Don't you have relationships?

39:33.200 --> 39:35.919
Isn't that what you're hired to do?
To take these things off the internet?

39:35.920 --> 39:37.399
But it's out there.

39:37.400 --> 39:40.199
Even if I could persuade one
site to pull down one clip,

39:40.200 --> 39:42.039
there are a dozen others
from other cell phones.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.919
What should we... should
we at least lawyer up

39:43.920 --> 39:45.639
and threaten legal
action or something?

39:45.640 --> 39:47.759
You threatening them with
lawyers builds on a story

39:47.760 --> 39:49.239
that's already getting
a lot of play.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.919
And then you get another
week of headlines.

39:50.920 --> 39:54.079
And then you got this food critic
posting fresh blogs about you nonstop.

39:54.080 --> 39:56.399
And they're all getting picked
up, and the picked-up headlines

39:56.400 --> 39:57.959
are getting picked
up by each other.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.679
You know, it's
absolutely unbelievable.

39:59.680 --> 40:01.119
- So...
- I've never seen anything like...

40:01.120 --> 40:03.119
Wait a second... you're saying
there's nothing I could do?

40:03.120 --> 40:05.319
To get the footage down?
No, that lives forever.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.799
Great. Awesome.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.239
But there just might be
an opportunity here.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.359
How can this possibly
be an opportunity?

40:11.360 --> 40:13.559
Well, I was holding
off until we spoke,

40:13.560 --> 40:16.799
but I'm fairly certain we have
a good shot at 'Hell's Kitchen'.

40:16.800 --> 40:19.079
- Wait, what?
- The reality show.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.119
I don't think you understand
what's going on here.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.839
I'm a real chef with...

40:22.840 --> 40:24.839
- You said you needed money, right?
- A job.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.319
A job, not money.
I need a job, like I had.

40:27.320 --> 40:30.439
Well, your Twitter account says
you've got 20,000 followers.

40:30.440 --> 40:32.519
- That's pretty damn big.
- Yeah, I'm gonna cancel the account.

40:32.520 --> 40:33.999
- Don't worry.
- Don't cancel it!

40:34.000 --> 40:35.999
I can get you money to
mention a few products.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.439
Are you listening? I don't wanna
get involved with any of that.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.399
- I wanna cook food.
- You got two choices.

40:40.400 --> 40:43.119
You can either lean into it
and work it for all it's worth...

40:43.120 --> 40:44.839
Like Honey Boo Boo.
I don't want that.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.799
You know how much she
pulls down? Or her mother?

40:46.800 --> 40:48.719
I don't care what she makes.
Get to your point.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.519
Or go underground and wait till the
storm passes. You got two choices.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.319
I thought this shit
lives forever online.

40:53.320 --> 40:56.439
It does, but there's so much
news out there and it's so fast

40:56.440 --> 40:58.439
and there's so much white noise,
nobody remembers anything.

40:58.440 --> 41:01.479
OK, thank you for taking the time
and walking me through everything.

41:01.480 --> 41:02.959
It was very illuminating.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.679
Oh, you're hanging up? OK, listen.

41:04.680 --> 41:06.599
I want you to call any time.
I'm right here.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.559
If you can't get me, I'm on a
cell phone and I've got a pager.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.799
- OK. Thank you, and thank Inez for me.
- No, thank you.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.399
- And what about 'Hell's Kitchen'?
- What about it?

41:13.400 --> 41:16.199
- You still want me to pursue it, right?
- No, I don't want you to.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.799
- OK, I won't call 'em, but I'll email.
- Are you not listening to...

41:18.800 --> 41:21.119
I'm gonna go, OK?
I got a call coming in.

41:21.120 --> 41:23.941
OK. Alright. I'll tell you
how 'Hell's Kitchen' goes.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.919
Fucking idiot.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.990
Oh, man.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.999
- Hey, Inez.
- Hi.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.999
- Did you talk to Jen?
- Yeah, I just got off with her.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.159
- And?
- And, uh, you know, it's terrible.

41:37.160 --> 41:40.039
What do you want me to
tell you? I just wanna cook.

41:40.040 --> 41:42.079
Everything is going to work out.

41:42.080 --> 41:44.719
Half-a-dozen places tried to poach
me when I was back at Gauloises.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.719
I'm trying to line up some
interviews for next week.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.839
That's good.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.879
Yeah, so, listen, until this
whole job thing works out,

41:51.880 --> 41:54.667
could you keep Percy for me?

41:56.480 --> 42:00.063
But you're still taking him
with you to New Orleans, right?

42:00.880 --> 42:02.870
Is he there?

42:03.960 --> 42:05.439
I'll tell him.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.559
Ah, let me... let me talk to him.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.550
Put him on.

42:14.320 --> 42:17.839
Hey, Dad. I understand if
we can't go to New Orleans.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.279
Oh, man, thank you so
much for saying that.

42:20.280 --> 42:23.799
Just Daddy's so busy with work
right now. You're the best.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.759
Maybe some other time.

42:25.760 --> 42:29.343
Yes, we will, for sure. Thank you.

42:30.640 --> 42:33.268
'Bye.

42:45.600 --> 42:47.479
Oh, jefecito.

42:47.480 --> 42:50.399
What's up, man? Look,
everybody. Jefe's here.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.439
Come on, give me some drinks.
Something premium.

42:52.440 --> 42:54.783
Ketel One for the man.

42:55.280 --> 42:57.199
Oh, dude. Oh, you're everywhere.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.679
- You saw it?
- Ohh!

42:58.680 --> 43:01.599
- It's bad. How bad is it?
- You saw it? You saw it?

43:01.600 --> 43:03.079
- I saw it. It's everywhere.
- It's terrible.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.879
- Is it bad?
- You're never gonna work again.

43:04.880 --> 43:06.679
I am, though.

43:06.680 --> 43:09.319
No, seriously, there are people...
there are people who are calling me.

43:09.320 --> 43:12.719
- Dude. Oh, great. I'm glad to hear that.
- Yes. Yes.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.719
I knew you would have
something bigger than this.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.519
- You don't care about coming back here.
- Yeah.

43:16.520 --> 43:19.119
So you came back to tell
me you got me a gig?

43:19.120 --> 43:20.599
'Cause I'll leave Gauloises
like that, baby.

43:20.600 --> 43:23.239
No. Trust me, the first phone call
as soon as something becomes real.

43:23.240 --> 43:24.839
- Don't leave me behind again.
- I will not.

43:24.840 --> 43:26.439
- Don't ever do that again.
- Don't hit me.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.039
- This guy.
- Please don't hit me. I'm sorry.

43:28.040 --> 43:29.959
I'm really sorry.
I was on the spot, bro.

43:29.960 --> 43:32.759
I had been drinking that day. I...
I... I didn't know what to do.

43:32.760 --> 43:34.759
- I'm a pussy, basically. I'm sorry.
- It's OK. It's over.

43:34.760 --> 43:36.999
- I vouch for that.
- It's fine. What are you gonna do?

43:37.000 --> 43:39.239
- It's a big opport...
- But then they put you on YouTube.

43:39.240 --> 43:40.959
And I felt so responsible
for that shit.

43:40.960 --> 43:43.319
- That shit was funny, by the way.
- What was funny about it?

43:43.320 --> 43:46.039
- It's not funny for me.
- Just that everybody I know saw it.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.919
- I know, I know.
- I kinda felt famous by knowing you.

43:48.920 --> 43:54.279
Is it a little bit funny? Like... Like, is it...
they're laughing at me or with me?

43:54.280 --> 43:56.319
A little bit of both.

43:56.320 --> 43:58.999
They're laughing with you and
at you at the same time.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.559
- It's so embarrassing.
- Oh, it is terrible. It is so bad.

44:01.560 --> 44:03.159
But it's funny too
at the same time.

44:03.160 --> 44:05.159
It makes you kind of
likeable in a weird way.

44:05.160 --> 44:08.319
Yeah. That guy deserved it. Everybody
knows that guy deserved it.

44:08.320 --> 44:10.239
- But, seriously, I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

44:10.240 --> 44:11.839
You know, I'm gonna
land on my feet.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.279
- Oh, you will.
- Yeah, good. I know.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.239
- I'll get my next gig.
- I'll be there with you.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.199
- Everything will be fine.
- I'm your sous-chef now and forever.

44:17.200 --> 44:19.599
You're not my sous-chef anymore.
You are chef de cuisine.

44:19.600 --> 44:21.519
- But I wouldn't even be there...
- It doesn't matter.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.239
Riva's right about one thing.

44:23.240 --> 44:25.879
You are ready to run your
own kitchen. So don't blow it.

44:25.880 --> 44:27.359
It's a big opportunity for you.

44:27.360 --> 44:29.799
- To Tony's big new opportunity.
- To Tony's big opportunity.

44:29.800 --> 44:32.159
- To chef de cuisine.
- I don't like how it happened.

44:32.160 --> 44:35.719
- But I'm happy it happened. OK?
- Two words, man.

44:35.720 --> 44:38.348
You guys. I love you fucking guys.

44:39.160 --> 44:42.439
- I love you, Tony. I love you.
- Thanks, Chef.

44:42.440 --> 44:43.999
- Look at that.
- Mmm.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.839
I love both of you.

44:45.840 --> 44:47.319
We love you, man.

44:47.320 --> 44:49.959
Let's have a three-way right here.
Come on. Come on.

44:49.960 --> 44:51.559
- Hang on, hang on.
- I love you, man.

44:51.560 --> 44:54.159
- I'm glad you made up with him.
- Thanks. Did you take the garbage out?

44:54.160 --> 44:57.479
The truth of the matter
is nobody's calling me.

44:57.480 --> 44:59.439
I got no job prospects whatsoever.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.839
- What about those offers you got?
- No. It's all dried out.

45:01.840 --> 45:04.239
- Why, from the online shit?
- It must be from the online thing.

45:04.240 --> 45:07.119
- Come on.
- I'm like a fucking cat playing a piano.

45:07.120 --> 45:08.639
I don't even know what that means.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.319
I'm everywhere.

45:10.320 --> 45:12.659
OK? Like, I'm, like...
I'm, like, a meme.

45:13.160 --> 45:15.679
Know what a meme is?
I'm a meme. I'm a fucking meme.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.719
Carl, you need to take a break.

45:17.720 --> 45:20.079
I've been on a break.
I've had too much of a break.

45:20.080 --> 45:22.079
- No, you need a real break.
- I need to work.

45:22.080 --> 45:24.319
- I need to get back into a kitchen.
- You don't. Carl...

45:24.320 --> 45:27.079
I wish I never... I should've cooked
the shit he wanted me to cook.

45:27.080 --> 45:29.839
You gonna go work for another
Riva in some other restaurant?

45:29.840 --> 45:33.559
You've been miserable here as
long as I've known you, Carl.

45:33.560 --> 45:35.999
- That's not true. We've had a blast.
- Yes, we've had a blast.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.343
And now it's time for you to go.

45:38.840 --> 45:40.839
You don't belong here anymore.
You know it. Come on.

45:40.840 --> 45:42.639
What's th... Who's this girl?

45:42.640 --> 45:44.869
- Carl.
- What?

45:45.760 --> 45:48.199
- Be real with me.
- I am.

45:48.200 --> 45:50.199
You've been ignoring a lot
of things in your life

45:50.200 --> 45:52.509
that need your
attention, like Percy.

45:55.680 --> 45:59.919
I'm not dad material right
now, if you hadn't noticed.

45:59.920 --> 46:02.119
I'm embarrassing.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.359
He sees all this shit
on the computer.

46:04.360 --> 46:06.679
- Well...
- His friends have...

46:06.680 --> 46:09.479
Maybe it's important for you
to talk to him about it, then.

46:09.480 --> 46:12.439
- I just...
- He needs you, Carl.

46:12.440 --> 46:15.599
I'm... I don't know him, OK?
He's at a weird age.

46:15.600 --> 46:18.421
Why don't you take this
time to get to know him?

46:24.880 --> 46:27.189
I want you to be happy.

46:28.320 --> 46:30.470
You're not happy.

46:31.960 --> 46:34.110
You're never gonna be happy here.

46:35.720 --> 46:37.710
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.599
I've never not known what I was
gonna do. I've always known.

46:40.600 --> 46:42.199
There's always been
the next thing to do.

46:42.200 --> 46:45.879
And now that it's all ended, and I'm,
like... I'm, like, fucking lost.

46:45.880 --> 46:48.621
I think that's a
good place to start.

46:55.280 --> 46:57.270
Come here.

47:00.320 --> 47:02.549
- You're the best.
- Yeah.

47:04.400 --> 47:07.719
- I'll hold down the fort. I promise.
- OK. You do that.

47:07.720 --> 47:09.745
Thank you.

47:15.360 --> 47:17.279
Hi, Flora. Percy here?

47:17.280 --> 47:19.119
Percy aqui?

47:19.120 --> 47:20.999
- He's inside.
- Can you tell him I'm here?

47:21.000 --> 47:22.479
- Sure.
- Thanks.

47:22.480 --> 47:25.159
- Hi.
- Why are you here?

47:25.160 --> 47:27.399
I'm here to see...
here to see Percy.

47:27.400 --> 47:28.879
- Oh.
- It's been a while.

47:28.880 --> 47:31.919
I'm glad you're here, but why didn't
you call to say that you were coming?

47:31.920 --> 47:34.479
- I don't know, because...
- He said he's sleeping.

47:34.480 --> 47:36.879
- OK. I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, no, wait one second.

47:36.880 --> 47:39.119
She said he says he's sleeping,
but if he was sleeping,

47:39.120 --> 47:40.959
she'd just say he's sleeping,
so he's not sleeping.

47:40.960 --> 47:44.319
- Let me talk to him.
- Can you talk to me for one second first?

47:44.320 --> 47:46.902
Please? Come.

47:48.360 --> 47:51.625
Percy and I are going to
Miami to see my father.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.199
So why don't you come with us?

47:54.200 --> 47:56.639
- What?
- Yeah, come with us.

47:56.640 --> 47:59.439
You want me to go... I can't
come with you to Miami.

47:59.440 --> 48:01.239
I don't... I got all...

48:01.240 --> 48:02.919
I don't have any money.

48:02.920 --> 48:05.719
I need to wait for another job,
for all this shit to blow over

48:05.720 --> 48:07.199
with the internet,
Twitter, all that shit.

48:07.200 --> 48:09.359
Yeah, but I could lend you
some money before you...

48:09.360 --> 48:11.599
I don't want your money.
I can't take charity from you.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.079
You know that he's really upset

48:13.080 --> 48:16.106
because he couldn't go with
you to New Orleans, right?

48:17.160 --> 48:20.140
He's hurt. He misses you.

48:22.680 --> 48:25.119
OK. What do you want me to do?

48:25.120 --> 48:27.559
You know that the nannies
can't get on the plane.

48:27.560 --> 48:30.399
So why don't you come with us

48:30.400 --> 48:33.346
and you take care of
him while I work?

48:33.840 --> 48:36.079
So you need me to come
with you to watch Percy?

48:36.080 --> 48:38.159
- Yeah.
- So I'm the nanny?

48:38.160 --> 48:41.311
Yes, his nanny, in Miami.

48:42.120 --> 48:45.399
It might be good. That's where
it all happened for you.

48:45.400 --> 48:46.879
That's where Percy was born,

48:46.880 --> 48:49.319
that's where you got your
first job as a chef.

48:49.320 --> 48:52.039
Maybe it will just, like,
clear your mind out.

48:52.040 --> 48:54.319
You think Percy would
be OK with that?

48:54.320 --> 48:56.079
Percy would love it.

48:59.720 --> 49:01.710
Hm?

49:02.640 --> 49:04.710
What do you say?

49:36.440 --> 49:38.599
I have to run out for
a quick meeting,

49:38.600 --> 49:40.839
so make sure when you go upstairs
that everything is pressed,

49:40.840 --> 49:43.239
order him some food, make sure
he takes a nap, a bath...

49:43.240 --> 49:45.239
- Wait, wait, wait, a nap?
- Get him ready for tonight.

49:45.240 --> 49:47.159
- I'm 10.
- It's gonna be a long night.

49:47.160 --> 49:48.919
We're gonna see Abuelito play.

49:48.920 --> 49:51.039
- Where? At Hoy Como Ayer?
- Mm-hm.

49:51.040 --> 49:53.279
- Isn't he a little young for that?
- Too young for what?

49:53.280 --> 49:54.759
He's not gonna perform forever.

49:54.760 --> 49:57.759
He wants his grandson to see
him play at least once.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.599
Alright, well, better
keep an eye on him.

49:59.600 --> 50:01.599
- That place could get pretty crazy.
- Me keep an eye?

50:01.600 --> 50:03.704
That's why you're going too.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.159
- Where are we?
- This is Little Havana.

50:13.160 --> 50:15.839
- Like in 'Grand Theft Auto'?
- No, this is where I grew up.

50:15.840 --> 50:17.319
- You did?
- Yes.

50:17.320 --> 50:20.599
And this is where
Abuelito lives and works.

50:20.600 --> 50:22.999
Grandpa still works?
What does he do?

50:46.800 --> 50:49.029
I can't see.

51:44.040 --> 51:46.119
- Eh, no, Papa.
- What did he say?

51:46.120 --> 51:48.359
No, he's asking if
we're back together.

51:48.360 --> 51:51.519
No, no, we're friends. I'm
helping watch the baby.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.599
Wait, what's he...
I don't understand.

51:56.600 --> 51:59.159
He said that you look like
you've gained a couple of pounds

51:59.160 --> 52:00.799
since he saw you last.

52:00.800 --> 52:02.279
Maybe since last
time, I understand,

52:02.280 --> 52:05.119
but, actually, recently,
I'm down 15 pounds.

52:10.480 --> 52:12.079
- 20?
- He's saying that he lost 20 pounds.

52:12.080 --> 52:14.079
- 20.
- I know what he said. But I'm down...

52:14.080 --> 52:17.359
That is in two months. I'm down...
In two weeks, I've lost 15.

52:17.860 --> 52:19.942
My suit doesn't even
fit me anymore.

52:20.840 --> 52:22.639
He's saying his pants might fall.

52:22.640 --> 52:24.119
20 pounds. 20.

52:24.120 --> 52:26.759
Why does he have to say 20?
I say 15, he says 20.

52:26.760 --> 52:28.479
I could... Alright.

52:28.480 --> 52:31.239
These are really good. We should
wake up Percy so he can try one.

52:32.240 --> 52:34.839
He say, "Just let him sleep. It's too late."

52:34.840 --> 52:38.439
No, but he's never had a real Cuban
sandwich. I want him to try it.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.479
He says you should make him one.

52:41.480 --> 52:44.439
I want him to have a real one
from here, from Little Havana.

52:44.440 --> 52:47.919
Abuelo... Everything OK?

52:50.360 --> 52:52.359
This is really good, by the way.

52:52.360 --> 52:54.464
Yours are way better.

52:59.440 --> 53:02.181
You think people would like
this kind of food back home?

53:02.800 --> 53:05.951
- You think people would like it?
- Yeah, it's real food. Why not?

53:08.000 --> 53:10.479
- Maybe I'll talk to Marvin.
- Mm-hm.

53:10.480 --> 53:13.199
Let me hear him out. You know?

53:13.200 --> 53:15.702
See what he's got in
mind for the food truck.

53:16.720 --> 53:18.199
Think he's in town?

53:18.200 --> 53:21.943
I don't know, but, you know, I can
find out tomorrow... I call him.

53:22.680 --> 53:25.319
You know he's here. Is this the
whole reason you brought me out?

53:25.320 --> 53:27.470
I don't know what
you're talking about.

53:28.120 --> 53:30.119
Try this. The yucca's amazing.

53:30.120 --> 53:32.110
I love yucca.

53:32.680 --> 53:34.670
You're full of shit.

53:49.040 --> 53:52.479
Hi. I'm Carl Casper.
I'm here to see Marvin.

53:52.480 --> 53:56.189
- Booties?
- Excuse me?

53:58.200 --> 54:00.439
In case you don't want
to remove your shoes.

54:00.440 --> 54:02.624
Thank you.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.159
- Uh!
- Follow me, please.

54:17.800 --> 54:19.825
Uhh!

54:27.120 --> 54:28.959
- Casper's here.
- How ya doing?

54:28.960 --> 54:31.039
- Glad you're here. Look at you.
- How's it going?

54:31.040 --> 54:32.519
Come over here.
Candy, come over here.

54:32.520 --> 54:34.159
You're a sight for sore eyes.

54:34.160 --> 54:36.639
What you want to eat, something?
I want to see you eat something.

54:36.640 --> 54:40.079
Alright? I'm worried. Eat
some crackers or something.

54:40.080 --> 54:42.070
Thanks.

54:44.160 --> 54:45.639
Look at you.

54:45.640 --> 54:48.479
She's pregnant. Just found out.

54:48.480 --> 54:50.519
The... This one?

54:50.520 --> 54:54.183
Pissed on a stick, came in,
laid it on me five seconds ago.

54:55.360 --> 54:56.839
Is it... So it's yours?

54:56.840 --> 54:59.707
I don't know. That's
what she's saying.

55:00.200 --> 55:02.799
- You don't...
- I know.

55:02.800 --> 55:05.599
I got a problem, 'cause she's...
best receptionist I've ever had.

55:05.600 --> 55:08.439
- Yeah.
- Good news is I had my tubes tied in '08.

55:08.440 --> 55:11.039
So, clearly, she's
also a fucking liar.

55:11.040 --> 55:13.559
- Right. That's tough.
- What do you want?

55:13.560 --> 55:15.039
You want a coconut water?

55:15.040 --> 55:16.759
- Um...
- You OK?

55:16.760 --> 55:18.319
I'm alright. I'm alright.

55:18.320 --> 55:19.919
- Do you want a drink?
- I would... No.

55:19.920 --> 55:21.959
Let's make some decisions
together. Let's start right here.

55:21.960 --> 55:23.439
- Alright, so...
- Let's start off easy.

55:23.440 --> 55:26.559
We got shit to talk about. Look,
bang, you got four swatches, right?

55:26.560 --> 55:29.319
Let's start off easy and then we'll
get into the uncomfortable stuff.

55:29.320 --> 55:31.199
- Pick it.
- The... For the...

55:31.200 --> 55:32.959
For here? I don't know.

55:32.960 --> 55:34.439
Yeah, I'm putting a carpet down,

55:34.440 --> 55:37.559
'cause people keep slippin' around
like it's a fuckin' ice rink in here.

55:37.560 --> 55:41.079
You could always get 'em...
take the booties off and, uh...

55:41.080 --> 55:42.799
Can't do that.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.399
We'll go with,
I don't know, this one?

55:44.400 --> 55:45.999
- You like that one?
- I think...

55:46.000 --> 55:48.399
If I had to... But if you're
not gonna paint, I would...

55:48.400 --> 55:49.999
This just seems like
it goes with anything.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.679
People aren't walking
on the walls, Carl.

55:51.680 --> 55:53.279
Or I could keep it if I want.

55:53.280 --> 55:55.279
- The...
- Keep the kid.

55:55.280 --> 55:56.759
- Yeah.
- Knowing that it's not mine.

55:56.760 --> 55:59.911
- Yes.
- You know, for once, I'm a good guy.

56:00.400 --> 56:03.439
She stays on my desk and I
fucking got something on her.

56:03.440 --> 56:05.510
But you decide. What do you think?

56:06.120 --> 56:07.959
Are we... we're talking
about the carpet now

56:07.960 --> 56:09.559
or are we talking about
the, um... the...

56:09.560 --> 56:11.839
- We're talking about...
- I don't even know anymore.

56:11.840 --> 56:14.599
I think, um...

56:14.600 --> 56:16.359
I'd go with the brown.

56:16.360 --> 56:19.159
And as far as that goes,
that's a personal... that's...

56:19.160 --> 56:22.079
- I don't know.
- You're not a turd, OK?

56:22.080 --> 56:26.199
I don't want you to feel that way coming
in here with your hat in your hand.

56:26.200 --> 56:28.639
You went fucking crazy on the
internet. That was awesome.

56:28.640 --> 56:32.239
You lost respect, which I
love, 'cause it's passion.

56:32.240 --> 56:33.719
You know, you lost everything.

56:33.720 --> 56:36.919
You know, you're not a loser,
but you have lost, OK?

56:36.920 --> 56:39.599
You're not a turd.
A turd that lost.

56:39.600 --> 56:41.559
I don't know that I
feel like a turd.

56:41.560 --> 56:43.679
- Good.
- I feel like I had a bad week.

56:43.680 --> 56:46.919
I feel like I lost my job, I made
an ass of myself on the internet.

56:46.920 --> 56:49.079
I'm divorced, I'm
old, I got no money.

56:49.080 --> 56:50.679
I live in a shitty
apartment in Venice.

56:50.680 --> 56:52.679
But you know what makes
me feel like a turd?

56:52.680 --> 56:55.399
That I'm in my ex-wife's ex-husband's
office and asking for a fucking favour

56:55.400 --> 56:56.999
and all he's doing
is busting my balls.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.741
I like this humility. It's good.

57:04.800 --> 57:08.159
Truth be told, food trucks are a
great idea. You know what I mean?

57:08.160 --> 57:10.599
I think we take it back
to something simple.

57:10.600 --> 57:13.399
Let me see if I got something to
say anymore. I don't even know.

57:13.400 --> 57:14.879
- It's no problem.
- I'll pay you back.

57:14.880 --> 57:18.439
As long as it's not weird for you...
I don't want you to feel like

57:18.440 --> 57:21.079
because you were with Inez and
you guys were sleeping together

57:21.080 --> 57:23.359
and I was with her
and we had this...

57:23.360 --> 57:26.679
I was with her, then you were with her,
and then maybe I fucked her after.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.784
I don't even know what
happened with us.

57:29.480 --> 57:31.799
I came out to LA for
a Clippers game once

57:31.800 --> 57:34.599
and I think we had a couple of
drinks and we went to Islands.

57:34.600 --> 57:36.599
- And I think she had...
- What happened between you two?

57:36.600 --> 57:38.519
You know what? It doesn't matter.
Here's what happened.

57:38.520 --> 57:42.079
We're talking about a white-on-white
'88 Chevy Grumman food truck.

57:42.080 --> 57:44.319
It's a blank canvas
for your dreams.

57:44.320 --> 57:46.390
I'm gonna have 'em pull it around.

57:47.080 --> 57:48.799
Thank you.

57:48.800 --> 57:51.143
Don't thank me till you see it.

58:13.640 --> 58:15.439
Yeah. I'm in Miami now.

58:15.440 --> 58:17.359
What happened to those
interviews you had?

58:17.360 --> 58:18.999
None of the prospects panned out.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.150
- For real?
- Yeah.

58:21.640 --> 58:23.119
It sucks.

58:23.120 --> 58:25.199
I guess you'll have to stay
there for a while, bro.

58:25.200 --> 58:29.625
Hey, Carl. Hey, papi, mira, I don't
know if you heard or not, but...

58:30.120 --> 58:32.239
I got bumped up, man, to sous-chef.

58:32.240 --> 58:33.719
- Sous-chef?
- Yeah.

58:33.720 --> 58:35.279
No shit! That's excellent!

58:35.280 --> 58:37.399
Congratulations, man.
That's a big deal.

58:37.400 --> 58:39.839
Thank you, man. That means a
lot coming from you, seriously.

58:39.840 --> 58:42.319
Yeah, but enough about me.
So, what are you gonna do?

58:42.320 --> 58:44.424
You're gonna laugh.

58:45.160 --> 58:47.399
- I got a food truck.
- Get the hell out!

58:47.400 --> 58:49.799
No shit. You got a
fucking taco truck?

58:49.800 --> 58:52.839
Tony! Tony, Carl's got
a fucking taco truck.

58:52.840 --> 58:54.719
For real?

58:54.720 --> 58:57.079
- Jefe! Like with tacos and shit?
- I just...

58:57.080 --> 58:59.599
Yeah, I would assume.
What are you gonna cook?

58:59.600 --> 59:03.519
You know, Cuban sandwiches,
plátanos, arroz con pollo.

59:03.520 --> 59:05.519
Simple shit like we used
to do for family meal.

59:05.520 --> 59:06.959
Oh, yeah, I remember
those days, man.

59:06.960 --> 59:09.159
- Fuck he doing with a taco truck?
- Goddamn.

59:09.160 --> 59:12.119
- I'd love some of that shit now.
- What's he doing with a taco truck?

59:12.120 --> 59:13.999
- It's good, right? It could be cool.
- Yeah.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.839
Get the fuck off the
phone, bro. Let's go!

59:15.840 --> 59:17.439
Alright, alright, alright!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.

59:17.440 --> 59:19.399
Attila the Hun is calling me.
I gotta go, man.

59:19.400 --> 59:21.311
Alright. Be good, man.

59:22.240 --> 59:24.959
- Is this the new truck?
- This is it. This is the truck.

59:24.960 --> 59:26.439
- Ahh!
- It's got good bones.

59:26.440 --> 59:28.039
It's gonna need a lot
of work, though.

59:28.040 --> 59:29.719
What doesn't?

59:29.720 --> 59:31.639
Wanna take a look around, champ?

59:31.640 --> 59:33.119
- Do I have to?
- Go!

59:33.120 --> 59:35.999
Go and look at your
dad's new truck.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.599
Can I ask you a question?

59:38.600 --> 59:40.319
Is something wrong?

59:40.320 --> 59:42.599
- Did you sleep with him?
- With who?

59:42.600 --> 59:44.359
With Marvin. Did you
sleep with Marvin?

59:44.360 --> 59:46.159
But of course I did.
He's my ex-husband.

59:46.160 --> 59:48.079
I mean, since we were
divorced. Have you slept...

59:48.080 --> 59:50.119
Who did you sleep
with last, him or me?

59:50.120 --> 59:52.519
I'm sorry, but this is none of
your business what I did...

59:52.520 --> 59:54.359
- I think it might be.
- ..after I divorce you.

59:54.360 --> 59:57.919
Second of all, I don't ask you what
you do with your hot little waitress.

59:57.920 --> 59:59.359
- That's completely different.
- OK, really.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.799
- And that's not fair.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.839
This is somebody you loved
and shared a life with...

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.839
Why do we have to talk
about this right now?

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.679
Because I took a business
meeting with the guy.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.919
- This is not the moment.
- It is. I wanna know why.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.639
He's smiling like he's
got something on me.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.439
- I dunno what it is.
- Please, you know him.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:15.039
- I do know how him.
- You know how he is. So who cares?

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.519
- I care!
- Why do you need to know?

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.599
- I just would like to...
- OK.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.239
It doesn't bother me.
I just wanna know.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.999
Just listen. I was very sad.
I was very lonely.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.239
- And you, more than anyone, know...
- OK. That's it. That's enough.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.279
how I get after I have
a couple of drinks.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.119
- I don't want to know the details.
- I get...

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.559
Please. I'm not one
of your girlfriends.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.359
- Don't tell me. Stop talking.
- He was my first.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:36.919
- OK, the kid's here.
- It came out like a natural, organic thing.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.343
- I don't want to know about this.
- We didn't...

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.389
We didn't go through with it.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.351
Sat there and we realised
we're just good friends.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.679
I think there's something
dead in there.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.239
Uhh. OK, go and look for it.
Maybe it's a rat.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.039
- Let's go look for the rat.
- I have to work, and I'll be back.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.879
- No, wait, wait, wait.
- You're going? No, no, no.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.319
You can't leave.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.159
You said you were
going to help me, OK?

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:03.599
Go work with your dad. It's fun.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.626
I'll be back later. 'Bye.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.639
Alright. Take that bucket, fill it.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.744
- See the hose?
- Mm-hm.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.279
Trash, trash, trash.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.839
Save that, save that.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.024
Save the metal ones.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.679
Ugh!

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.826
Tip it over.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.150
Alright, buddy.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.879
I got some presents for you.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.870
Watch this.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.719
Steel wool, right?

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.359
- Mm-hm.
- Scrub brush. Right?

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.431
I want you to do that
on the whole truck.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.319
Hey, buddy, you don't have to
clean that. We're throwing it out.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.310
Alright? Clean something else.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.319
Alright, that looks good.
Clean out the lowboy now.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.799
- The what?
- The low...

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.985
The reach-in fridge,
right here. Clean this out.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.559
Ohh! That's it.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.919
That's where the smell's
coming from. What is that?

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.422
I don't know. Whatever
it is, clean it out.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.199
- Ohh...
- What the hell are you doing?

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.959
- You told me to clean it out.
- Not throw it in the garbage.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.359
That's a perfectly good
hotel pan. Scrub it out.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:09.759
No, that's gross! I'm
not cleaning that out.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.919
- Pick it out of the garbage.
- Are you kidding?

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.919
- It's disgusting.
- You don't throw it in the garbage.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.559
Like we saved the rest of
the stuff. Let's just clean it out.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.359
No.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.589
- Pick it out of the trash.
- No.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.784
Pick it out of the trash can.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.239
You wanted to work in a kitchen.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.359
This is what working
in a kitchen is, OK?

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.759
- We don't throw shit out.
- Yeah, I wanted to come and cook.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.639
- Not clean it!
- Pick it out of the garbage!

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.359
No! I cleaned your
whole stupid truck!

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.464
Why are you so mean to me?!

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.391
Hey, I can't get a
hold of your mom.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.719
But you... The truck looks great.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.719
You did a great job.
I'm sorry I was mean.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.949
That wasn't right of me.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.039
I gotta pick up some
equipment for the truck.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.719
You wanna come with me and help me
pick out a stove till Mom calls back?

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.239
Fine.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.359
Alright. Let's go.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.959
You know what this is?

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.999
- French fries?
- That's right, a fryer.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.399
This is the one we need right
here. Come on, let's go.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.879
Double convection oven underneath.
It's a real workhorse.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.919
60 inches. I think we could fit them
on the truck. What do you think?

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.199
- Let's get it.
- Let's get this one. Good. Done.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.919
This is the... Ah,
here's what we need.

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.919
This is the thing I was
looking for. Right there.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.959
- A George Foreman grill?
- That's not a George Foreman grill.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.959
It's called a plancha. We make
Cuban sandwiches on that.

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.239
This is the key to our entire
livelihood. We need two of these.

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.719
Looks good. You know what?

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.839
Let's also get the 6-inch chef's
knife with the plastic handle.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.184
- Then you need also the holder.
- Yeah, let's get a cover as well.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.750
OK, you see this, Percy?

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.919
That's a chef's knife.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.439
A real chef's knife.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.022
It's not a toy. You understand?

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.439
This thing's sharp. It can send you
to the hospital if you're not careful.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.590
I'll teach you how
to use this thing.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:16.039
But a chef's knife, it belongs
to the chef, not to the kitchen.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.719
So it's your responsibility to keep
it sharp, clean, not to lose it.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.348
- Can you handle that?
- Yes.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.679
This is a good knife.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.079
It'll last you a long time
if you take care of it.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.079
Don't lose it.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.947
I won't. Thank you.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.990
You earned it.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.119
How are we gonna
get it in the truck?

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.639
Well, Marvin said we could use
some of his guys to help out.

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.439
Hey, guys! Hello?

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.830
I'm Carl. This is my truck.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.919
I need some help moving
this equipment in.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.388
Marvin said that you
guys might help me.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.503
I got it. Mind if I borrow this?

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.469
Get to the top floor.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.508
Maybe a little higher?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.719
The hard part was getting
it over to the truck,

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.745
and now we just have to tip.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.759
If I can get one end
up on the tailgate.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.239
OK.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:20.839
Oh, hey, hey. Don't do that. You're
gonna rupture something, man.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.439
- Hey!
- Martin!

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.999
Hey, killer, what's up? How you
doing, little gangster, huh?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.639
- What the hell you doing here?
- I warned you, man. I warned you.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.079
If you got another gig, I was gonna drop
everything to be your line cook. Didn't I?

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.919
This is a food truck.
You're a sous-chef now.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.799
So? Food trucks don't
need a sous-chef?

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.039
OK, fine. You're hired.
Pays nothing.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.519
- I'll take it.
- Nice!

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.519
- You're not gonna scare me, buddy.
- Thank you so much.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.319
You must've jumped on a plane
as soon as we got off the phone.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.079
Dude, when I heard your voice,
I was like, "That's what I wanna do."

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.799
- I'm so happy you're here.
- Me too, man.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.799
- We're trying to get this in the truck.
- Yeah?

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.559
I need some sort of,
like, lever and fulcrum.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.039
Come on, everybody.
Everybody together. Come on.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.759
Holy sh... No, we can't do this.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.439
No way, not without one of us
hurting ourselves. No, no, no, don't.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.039
Stop. Stop. I got it, I got it.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.639
Carl, easy.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.999
- It's good to know Spanish.
- You gotta, man.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.709
Thank you. Thank you, guys.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.519
- Ah!
- OK, good.

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:35.999
- Nice.
- Fryer next?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.479
No, no, forget the
freaking fryer, man.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.959
I'm gonna fill up
the propane tanks,

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.839
you go to the market...
get cerveza, not beer.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:44.439
I can't go to the market. We gotta hook
up the fryer. Get rid of the steam pit.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.479
No, by the time you get back, I'll
have this all spotless and cleaned up.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.919
I got lots of marinating to do.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.919
I promised these people the
best sandwich of their lives.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.359
- OK. Good. So...
- Get me the mojo.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.199
OK, so, what do you need?
Oranges, onion, garlic.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.599
That's right. Why don't we
juice it up a little bit, huh?

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.079
- Tomatillo.
- Some chillies, yeah. Cilantro.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.679
- Now get the hell outta here.
- Let's go.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.279
OK, look, the key is, you
gotta look for ingredients

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.359
and then that gives you
ideas of what to cook.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.159
Like, this is yucca, right?

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.919
Get some of that. Those
look great. See that?

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.639
And... Oh, come here.

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.399
You know what this is?

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.959
Uh, bananas?

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.078
That's called a plantain. Plátanos.

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.759
These are maduros. Feel, soft?

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.519
- Mm-hm.
- That's the sweet kind.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:23.198
But we want the green ones.
Here. Hang onto this.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.038
This is what you
make tostones with.

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.919
That's Martin's favourite.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.799
- I got it. I got it.
- You got it? Too much?

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.559
- I got it.
- OK.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.919
- Watch out for tarantulas. Come on.
- What?

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:14.078
Ahh! That's good.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.559
Oh, look at that.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.959
Oh, yeah. My masterpiece, baby.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:22.679
- That's beautiful.
- Miami, I am back. Pow!

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:26.502
You could have just bought this at
the store. I think they sold it there.

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:29.238
- You sure that's your son, man?
- I don't know.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.719
You'd better get a paternity test.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:35.145
- Oh, that looks incred...
- Can I have some?

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.919
Oh, Martin.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.799
- Please, just gimme some.
- It's not from the store.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.198
- You might not like it.
- It's fatty but not heavy, you know?

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.999
- You don't want any of this.
- Yes, I do.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.959
- You're probably vegan. You can't eat it.
- I'm not vegan.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.559
- It's not from the store.
- Oh, my God.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.238
- Martin, come on. Can I have some?
- Hold on a second.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.599
- Can I give him a piece, Martin?
- Nah, man, he's not...

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.501
- Alright. Let me think about it.
- Just a little piece. Let's see.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.079
- Pretty good.
- Pretty good?

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.919
- Pretty good? Come on!
- Better than the store?

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.439
One more. Just one more.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.799
The best shit you ever had
in your life. Come on, man.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.559
Oh, give me another one. If you're
gonna give him some, give me some.

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.959
- Don't be cheap.
- I want more.

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.399
You know what? Let's
make some sandwiches.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.141
- Yes, sir. Let's get to it.
- Alright. Ready to go?

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.519
Hey, little man, is
the plancha red-hot?

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.039
- Huh?
- Me?

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.508
No, I'm talking to the grill.
Yeah, you.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.079
- Do I touch it?
- Well, what do you think?

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.479
- No.
- That's right. No, genius.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.239
Hey, look. Come over here, look.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.799
- See this water?
- Mm-hm.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.279
- Bang. Is it hot?
- Yes.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.359
- Tell him it's hot.
- It's hot.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.479
- OK.
- Is it hot as your daddy's underwear?

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.959
Good. Now, watch. Come over here.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.799
Here we go, papi.
Perfect. Perfecto.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.639
Now, watch me.
Watch what I'm doing.

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.199
Two slices of ham, three of pork.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.999
- Now come over here.
- Now the maestro.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.639
Two slices of cheese... one, two.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.879
- Two pickles.
- Can I do pickles?

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:51.759
Big pickles. Nice. One, two.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.519
Now, watch this. Take this...
mustard, from end to end.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.839
OK.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.679
You go side to side,
not forward and back.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.559
Now, this is the
most important part.

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.719
- This is what makes it a Cubano.
- OK.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.519
- Take the butter. See that?
- Yeah.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:06.399
On top. Take a little bit.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.839
Butter the grill.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.839
In. Just like that.

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.799
Now, watch.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.039
I want you to watch for
the bread to get golden.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.959
I want you to watch for
the cheese to melt.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.359
When that cheese is melted and that
bread's golden, but not burnt,

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.759
you call me, you tell me it's
done and we'll check, OK?

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.830
- OK.
- Keep an eye on it.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.559
I want you to watch
everything everybody's doing,

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.719
because when we're hopping, you're
gonna have to jump in on the line

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.199
and help out.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.101
- I think it's done.
- You think it's done?

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.599
- Oh, look at that.
- See how golden that is?

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.439
- That's how you want it every time.
- Nice job.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.679
You gotta be like a robot
when you're on a line.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.119
You're the shit, baby.
You're the shit.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.119
OK?

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.199
Mmm! Three equal pieces.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.399
- Let's see what we got.
- Alright, here we go.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.799
- Oh, hot.
- Ah. Let me see.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.519
Look at that cheese.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.799
- Oh, my God, man.
- This is the shit.

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.599
- This is it.
- Oh!

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.159
- This is it.
- This is it.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.039
- It's incredible.
- This is empingao.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.519
- Oh, empingao!
- Empingao, man.

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:16.279
- So, is it good?
- It's amazing.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.399
Then I guess we're open.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.982
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. We're open?

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.159
I didn't get to finish my sandwich.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:26.319
- Here you go.
- What do I do?

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.959
Cut the bread.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.439
There's cerveza down there.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.519
Little man, get me hazelnuts,
get me some more ham.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.039
OK.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.519
Alright, I got four right here.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:50.279
Hey, jefe, this sound
system sounds like ass.

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:53.279
But my cousin knows a guy who'll hook
us up with all our musical necessities.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.919
My credit cards are maxed out and
we're not charging for food yet.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.679
- So we'll wait on the sound system.
- But you look happy, baby, don't you?

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.919
- So happy. So happy.
- Yeah, that's what's champing it.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.399
Uh-huh!

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.599
- I got one.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.119
- That's burnt.
- So?

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.359
They're not paying for it.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.759
Come with me. Get off the truck.

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.999
- You got this?
- Yeah, I got it. You get down.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.264
Slow down for a second.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:19.319
- Is this boring to you?
- No, I like it.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.799
Yeah, well, I love it.

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:23.519
Everything good that's happened to
me in my life came because of that.

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:26.359
I might not do everything
great in my life, OK?

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.439
I'm not perfect. I'm
not the best husband.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.181
And I'm sorry if I
wasn't the best father.

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.590
But I'm good at this.

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.719
And I wanna share this with you.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.959
I wanna teach you what I learned.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.145
I get to touch people's
lives with what I do.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.182
And it keeps me
going, and I love it.

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.479
And I think if you give it a
shot, you might love it too.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.470
Yes, Chef.

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.959
Now, should we have
served that sandwich?

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.189
No, Chef.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.399
That's my son. Get back in there.
We got some hungry people.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.390
He's ready to cook!

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:04.199
- We did good, man.
- We did good.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.599
- We got something here.
- I say we stick with the traditional menu.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.599
- We don't get too fancy.
- We'll get some yucca fries.

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.639
- We got the fryer.
- That's classic. Another beer, boss?

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.744
- No, I'm good.
- Alright.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.719
Here you go, little man.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.710
You sure?

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.919
Is this beer?

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.919
No, of course not. I would
never hand you beer.

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.639
- That's cerveza.
- I'm 10. I can't have beer.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.679
You're not 10. You're kitchen staff.
Kitchen staff doesn't have an age.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.759
Dad?

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.750
You can have a sip.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.479
Huh?

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.079
- Like piss, right?
- Worse.

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:43.079
You remember that when your
friends offer you a beer.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.679
- I figure we go to South Beach...
- Mm-hm.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.959
stake out the truck a little
bit, get the menu straight.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.919
Then after we're really confident
we got something good,

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.399
then we drive back to LA.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.279
And hit a few extra
cities on the way?

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.759
Why not?

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.879
- Can I come?
- Can you come?

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.639
- Come where?
- On the trip.

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.639
This isn't a trip. We're
just driving the truck back.

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.119
You're flying first class with
Mommy with all the divorce money.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.079
Yeah, but you're
stopping in cities.

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.628
- Yeah, but you got school.
- I'm on break.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.599
I don't know.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.439
Martin, I like your mojo.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.479
- Hey, don't work me.
- Oh, you hitting Martin?

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.319
- You're working Martin?
- Working me like that.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.159
- He's ice-cold.
- He knows my soft spot, though.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.639
He likes your mojo.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.479
- He got me, man.
- We'll talk to your mom.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.159
- We'll see what she says.
- I already did.

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.839
- She's cool with it.
- Look at that.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.439
He's not... He's 10,
he's got a phone.

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.759
Good for you. Good for
you, man. Get things done.

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.239
Why not? Why not? Bring him along.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.239
So I'm going?

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.239
Yeah.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.479
- Yeah, you can come.
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.664
Go by the backhoe.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.639
You want me to take
a poop over there?

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.119
Hey, Carl. Carl, check it out.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:45.719
I'll drop you guys
off at the hotel,

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.119
and in the morning, you go get
the rest of the ingredients,

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.719
stock up on stuff, and I'll
put a coat of paint on this.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.719
Don't bother painting. We'll
paint it when we get back.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.959
- It looks fine like this.
- No, man. This is on me.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.199
My cousin knows a guy. I'm
gonna hook it up. Alright?

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.679
OK.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.279
Who's hungry? Huh?

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:26.079
If you change your mind, you call
me and I'll go get you anywhere.

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:28.344
Come on. Let's sell
sandwiches, baby!

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.959
- OK, call me.
- Come on, buddy.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.119
Cuidado.

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:37.224
- Call me.
- I will.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.439
Alright, buddy, I need
you to get me a crowd.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.239
- Yes, Chef. You know it.
- Alright.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.119
Step right up.

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.839
Best Cuban food in
all of South Beach.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.479
Come on, don't be afraid. Step up!

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:25.279
If you need it more authentic,
you can swim 90 miles that way.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.839
If you can pronounce
it, we can make it.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:33.959
Arroz con pollo, yuca frita.

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.599
OK, four media noches coming up.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.319
Cubano.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.159
- You got it?
- I got four ready over here.

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.719
- Yucca fries, plantas was you?
- Yeah.

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:43.559
Here we go. Thank you.
Thanks for your patience.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.959
- Who needs a little bit more?
- We got four Cubano all day.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.959
- Four Cubano all day.
- Hey, this one's not ready, OK?

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.959
- I'm buttering that one.
- I got it. I got it.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.439
- Crap!
- Yucca!

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.039
- One frites for you.
- I burned my finger.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.519
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.119
- You wanna keep going or stop?
- Keep going.

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.759
- OK, keep going, keep going.
- Go, little man.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.639
Help him with that banana
ketchup and yucca fries.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.119
Go with the chile,
the chile vinegar.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.079
- Good job.
- Hold on one second.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.639
- It's coming.
- Is that enough?

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.279
That's perfect. Here you go.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.987
- How's the yucca frita?
- It's perfect.

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.679
Step aside, step aside.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.719
Thank you.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.199
Who's in charge here?

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.719
Um, uh, me. What do you need, sir?

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.719
- I need to talk to you on the side.
- OK.

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.719
- On the side, please. Right away.
- I got you. I got it, I got it.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.679
Alright, alright. Relax, relax.
Keep it down. Keep it down.

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.199
Hang on, guys. Come on.
Hang on, hang on.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.759
Hang on, hang on.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:52.501
- Need to see a permit.
- Permit, yeah, we got it.

01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.679
Should be good.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.519
Yeah, permit's good. You're just
not good to sell here right now.

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:04.159
OK, alright. Thank you. So just,
what, a half-mile down the road?

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.639
Yeah. As long as you're not right
on South Beach, you're OK.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.869
- No problem. Sorry about that.
- Hey...

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.959
Aren't you the lava cake guy?

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:15.159
- Uh, yeah, from the internet.
- Yeah.

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.679
Yeah.

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.119
My kid and I saw you on 'Tosh.0'.
You were hilarious.

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.439
Thanks. OK, great.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.839
- That was hilarious.
- OK.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.879
Hey, can I get a quick
picture with you for my kid?

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.479
- For my kid.
- Sure.

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.159
- Yeah.
- Hey, you know how to work this?

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.559
- Hey, Martin, help me out.
- What is that, a flat-screen TV?

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.461
Hold on a second. Let me
unlock it for you real quick.

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.879
Hang on. We're gonna
move it down the road.

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.479
It's hard to use other
people's technology.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.479
- Big one.
- Arm around you? Is that good?

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.519
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Alright, how do I... What do I press?

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.359
Just touch the... Tap the
screen first. Hold on.

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.199
- OK.
- Let me make sure it's not on video.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.999
It's on... Yeah, it's on. And then
put on camera. There we go. Yeah.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.399
Alright. Get together.

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.239
You have to tap the
centre of the screen,

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:57.039
and when you see a box, make
sure the box is around our head.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.519
- OK.
- Whatever you're shooting's in the box.

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.359
- Just take the fucking picture, OK?
- I got it.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.999
- There we go.
- Thanks. Let's take the...

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.839
Oh, and your finger's
in front of the camera.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.519
- Sorry, sorry!
- Good. Great.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.999
- I got it.
- OK. Thank you.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.479
- Alright. Thank you.
- Thank you, Officer.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:11.559
Hey, can I just take a picture
up there in the kitchen?

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.759
- On the truck?
- That'd be great, yeah.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.159
- Got it.
- And good. OK.

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.199
Can I take one pressing a
sandwich or something?

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.919
- Got it.
- Good? OK.
- Alright.

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:21.399
Can we do one more where...
with 'Lady and the Tramp'...

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.479
you know, you're biting one
end, I'm biting the other?

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:25.584
- Come on, you can do this.
- OK.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.862
You got it? You got it? Go.

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.950
I think I missed the exit.

01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:02.825
Oww!

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.679
What the hell are you doing?
You sending pictures to Mom?

01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:16.959
- I'm posting a Vine.
- A Vine? What's a Vine?

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:19.319
It's a video. Look.

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.319
Hey, come on, man!
Get that out of my face.

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.639
- Seriously.
- Christ.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.359
- It's only six seconds.
- Who'd make a video six seconds?

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.639
- A six-second video.
- Can you believe this generation?

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.959
Unbelievable, man.
Little attention. ADHD.

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.919
- ADHD is right.
- That's nothing.

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:35.359
I've also been shooting these videos...
one second every day.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.159
One-second videos?
Now you're joking with me.

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.839
No. You edit 'em all together.

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.439
One second of every day.

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.759
And then you cut 'em together
and watch it. It's cool.

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:45.119
OK, enough with the virtual world.
How about something real?

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.679
Who wants to stop at Disney World?

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:49.679
- Oh, yeah, I do.
- Disney World? That's real?

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.359
We shouldn't stop till
we hit New Orleans.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.399
- Hey! Hey, that is your son.
- That's my boy.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.639
A kid who'd rather go to New
Orleans than Disney World.

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.079
Now I've seen everything.

01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:58.719
I can't wait to try
my first beignet.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:01.119
Every other person you say 'New
Orleans' to thinks jazz and voodoo.

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.479
Yeah, he thinks...

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:04.559
- Your kid thinks doughnuts.
- Doughnuts. Yeah, I know.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:07.506
I like that. Alright, New Orleans.

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.439
What are you doing?

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:38.319
Dude, I'm putting a little
cornstarch on my werewolves, man.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.839
It's too humid down here.

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.999
Dad. Dad.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.399
- Wake up.
- What?

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.902
Martin's putting
cornstarch on his balls.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.719
You putting cornstarch
on your balls?

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.710
Yes, sir.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.350
Let me get some?

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.799
Want some?

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.790
Here.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.959
It's like baby powder.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:13.505
Put it on your nuts.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.119
- It's nice, right?
- Nice.

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.719
What's good is in the morning,

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.839
you could dip your nuts in
oil and make hushpuppies.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.719
Alright, come on. Come on.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.479
Out.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.679
Alright, backing up.

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:01.148
Come on, come on.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.390
OK, watch out, baby-cakes.

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.039
OK.

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.065
Whoo!

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:11.799
Nice driving skills, huh?

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.799
- I'm getting the hang of this thing.
- I'm telling ya.

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.639
- Alright, I'm taking my kid for a walk.
- Yeah.

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:17.679
Oh, nice. I get
promoted to sous-chef.

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:19.679
- But I gotta do all the hard work?
- Yeah. Thanks.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.359
- Thank you.
- Where are we, Bourbon Street?

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.719
Nah, this is Frenchman Street.
Bourbon's for tourists.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:26.109
We're in the Marigny. Come with me.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:28.999
- Where we going?
- Just come.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.865
Come on. French Quarter.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.466
We're going to Café Du Monde.

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:37.399
You ever heard of Café Du Monde?

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.902
Is this the beignet place?

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.951
You ready? We drove a
long way for these.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.559
Here we go.

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.199
Eat it slow.

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.319
You're never gonna have
your first beignet ever again.

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.839
Pretty cool.

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.519
- It's cool, right? You like it?
- Mm-hm.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:06.102
They don't taste like this
anywhere else in the world.

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.039
- So, what else you gotta buy?
- Nothing.

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.679
Not anything for work?

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.359
Nope.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.319
- Really?
- Nah.

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.279
Just wanted to get some
beignets with you.

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.270
Cool.

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:20.399
I like New Orleans.

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.519
I like New Orleans too.

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:25.999
- Somebody ate my body.
- I didn't brush my teeth.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.559
This is what happens to you when
you don't brush your teeth.

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.119
- Dude, dude! Where were you, man?
- What? I went shopping.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.159
- You went shopping?
- I called you, man. I texted you.

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.759
- We got beignets.
- Where the hell were you?

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:37.359
- You got beignets? I've been calling.
- We got some beets for the truck.

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.519
- Why didn't you answer your phone?
- My phone was on vibrate.

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.679
- You put your phone on vibrate.
- Chill out. What's the big...

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.439
- I'm sorry.
- Chill out? Just take a look.

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.399
Take a look. Please take a look.

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.159
- Is that for us?
- That's for us.

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.999
- That whole line's for us?
- Can you believe that?

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.479
Oh, my God!

01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:58.479
Alright, so, I guess we
gotta cook some food.

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:00.719
- We gotta cook some food.
- Alright, so you good with prep?

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.319
- Yes, sir.
- We're gonna get through this.

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:03.759
- You ready?
- I'm ready, boss.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.199
- OK. Buy me five minutes.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.199
Could you give us five minutes,
please? Five minutes.

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.159
We'll be right there
in five more minutes.

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:11.639
Got everything... Plancha's...
Everything's hot.

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:14.359
- Oil's hot. You got everything ready.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:15.839
You are a superstar!

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:18.159
- You are a superstar.
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:21.359
Oh! And how'd you get that crowd?
You got a huge crowd outside.

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.999
I didn't. I just came back from
shopping, there was this long line.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.359
- I thought it was a mistake.
- I tweeted it.

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.589
- You what?
- What'd you do?

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:32.759
I tweeted the picture on your account
and then geotagged it. Look.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.679
Wait, man, you did...
you did what? You geo...

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.479
I tagged it so they can
mark us on their maps.

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:39.599
Look at those pictures.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.079
How'd you... What'd you...

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:42.559
- These pictures are from here.
- Mm-hm.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.999
How'd you get those
pictures from here?

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.759
When I was going to Café Du Monde.

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.679
- And you put it online?
- Mm-hm.

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.559
You're a genius, kid.

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.959
You're the reason everybody's
here. You know that?

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:54.479
You're my new head of
marketing. Thank you.

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.279
Alright, so, I'm gonna
hit the chalkboard.

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:59.319
You walk him through the prep on the
po' boys and get the plancha going.

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.399
Yes, Chef. Yes, Chef. Jefecito.

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.599
You butter the
plancha, son, alright?

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.199
I got this. Percy, look. Whoo!

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.271
Yes, sir.

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:13.439
Single file, y'all. Right here.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:17.319
0-8? There you go. Thank you
very much. Napkins are down there.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:19.519
- Another beignet coming up.
- Hang on a second.

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.399
- Number seven.
- There you go, two more.

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.879
Cubano coming up.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:26.119
Hang on, one second.
He's my kid. He's just learning.

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:28.319
- Put you on the Twitter?
- Watch your back.

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.719
That's my kid. He did all that.

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:32.279
- More beignets.
- How's that po' boy coming?

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.239
- It's coming up with shrimp.
- Alright.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:36.519
It's worth the wait, I promise.

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.439
<i>Baby</i>

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.079
<i>I'm hot just like an oven</i>

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.719
<i>I need some lovin'</i>

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.439
<i>And, baby</i>

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:27.039
<i>I can't hold it much longer</i>

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.999
<i>It's getting
stronger and stronger</i>

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.319
<i>And when I get that feelin',
I want sexual healing</i>

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:39.119
<i>Sexual healing is good for me</i>

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.988
<i>Makes me feel so fine</i>

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:46.679
<i>Helps to relieve my mind</i>

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:47.839
<i>Yeah</i>

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:52.199
<i>Sexual healing,
baby, is good for me</i>

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:56.919
<i>Sexual healing is something
that's good for me</i>

01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:01.199
<i>Whenever blue
teardrops are falling</i>

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:05.879
<i>And my emotional
stability is leaving me</i>

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:09.119
<i>There is something I can do</i>

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:14.159
<i>I can get on the telephone
and call you up, baby</i>

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:19.119
<i>Honey, I know you'll
be there to relieve me</i>

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:22.479
<i>The love you give to me will...</i>

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.359
Jefe, jefe. It says
'sold out', man.

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:27.340
We should be good. I think
they're holding for us.

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:29.999
- Hey, Benji.
- Hey.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.399
- We got here as fast as we could.
- Hopefully we're still good.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.399
- You got anything for me?
- Gotta check with the man.

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:35.879
- In the back.
- OK, thanks.

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.870
What's up, killer?

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:43.359
- Hey, Aaron.
- What's up, Carl?

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.759
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:46.239
Driving all night. Doing good.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.839
- You still got the stuff?
- Let's do it.

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:49.439
Oh. He's got the stuff.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:53.039
- What is this place?
- This is Texas OG barbecue.

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:56.862
These guys gotta stay up all night
and stoke those fires low and slow.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.464
Oh, man, that's gorgeous.

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.559
- So how many can I get?
- I guess four.

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.999
- I'll take it.
- Alright.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.025
Whoo!

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.399
- Nice.
- Oh, yeah.

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:11.187
Yeah. Oh, there we go.

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.359
Oh, oh!

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:16.519
- Oh, man.
- Mmm!

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.879
Mmm. We should get some sliders.

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.439
- Wow.
- We should do sliders, man.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.799
- Oh, my God.
- We get some King's Hawaiian bread.

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.279
- Mm-hm.
- Pickle, barbecue sauce.

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:26.919
What if we swapped this out for
the pork in the media noche?

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:29.559
- What do you think about that?
- Swap this for the pork shoulder?

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.159
- Make, like, an Austin Midnight.
- I like that.

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:32.999
- That's hot. I like that.
- That is hot, baby.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.399
Let me get one more of these.
You should check this out.

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.399
- Just let me cut right through.
- Mmm.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.239
- Save it, dog.
- I know. We're gonna save it.

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:41.079
- Use it all up, man.
- I'll give you half.

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:44.390
- Know you can't eat your own supply.
- Put it away after this.

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:03.079
<i>Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:05.959
<i>Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:11.479
<i>Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:13.279
<i>Yeah</i>

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:18.627
<i>Travis County took my picture
but, no, I didn't smile</i>

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:24.639
<i>They told me I was gonna be
here for a pretty long while</i>

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:27.119
<i>One day, I was
walking down the street</i>

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:30.319
<i>When I should've been
walking down the hall...</i>

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:32.919
- Six sliders all day.
- 69's coming up.

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.946
Ah! One is coming up.

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.919
Media noche, Texas.

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:41.639
- Whoo!
- This is getting murdered.

01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:43.639
You got that three media
noches coming up?

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:44.959
Alright.

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.439
Order 65 and 66.

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:50.959
- I got po' boy right here.
- One sec.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.439
- You got the transfer pan?
- Cubano.

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.039
Thank you. Good. Hey, your
phone's ringing, Percy.

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:56.304
Sorry.

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.759
- Hey, Mom.
- Where are you?

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:03.159
- I'm in Austin.
- Are you OK?

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.999
- I'm great.
- How's your daddy?

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.959
Here, talk to him.

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:08.439
- Hi, Inez.
- Hi.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:11.119
- You want me to pick him up?
- No, you're a thousand miles away.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:13.759
It's OK. I can go get on
a plane and pick him up.

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:15.599
- No, it's fine. He's doing great.
- "I miss him.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.719
"I want you to come home.
I love him."

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:20.879
He's fine. He's got a couple of burns
and two stitches from a paring knife.

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.919
Please, I'm serious.
Let me go and pick him up.

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:24.719
You know your son's a cook now?

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.919
- I'm a line cook.
- He's a line cook.

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:28.399
Be careful!

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:29.999
I'll have him home
in time for school.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.599
- And you? Are you OK?
- I'm amazing!

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:36.559
"Oh, you're so sexy in that bandana.
I want your big platanos."

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:39.119
Looks here like you guys
are having so much fun.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.919
Alright, give me one second. Did you
know your son could work a grill?

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:43.399
- I had beer.
- What did he say?

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.839
Stop. Stop, stop.
He says he misses you.

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:47.679
Aww, tell him I love him.

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:50.199
- Dad got me a knife.
- He says, "I love you."

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.639
- What?
- "I love you!"

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:54.869
I love you too!

01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:01.309
Tell... tell him,
"I love you too." OK?

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.510
'Bye.

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:08.159
Alright, 70!

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:14.319
<i>Every day
and nothing seem to change</i>

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:18.919
<i>Everywhere I go,
I keep seeing the same old thing</i>

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:21.263
<i>And I</i>

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.104
<i>I can't take it no more...</i>

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.428
- Let's take a selfie.
- A selfie?

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:33.708
Wait, let me do it with
the flash. Hold on.

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:39.348
Oh, look at that.
Email that to me, alright?

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.319
OK.

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.839
Mind if I post this?

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:45.959
- What is that, another Vine?
- No, it's 'One Second Every Day' video.

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.439
Remember?

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:50.639
- It's the trip all cut together?
- Oh, the little cuts of the thing?

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:52.279
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, just email it to me.

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.239
I'm sure it's fine.

01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:57.999
Listen, I, uh... I want to
talk to you about something.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.879
Yeah?

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:03.479
I've had a really good time with
you these last couple of weeks.

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.159
Me too.

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:07.150
And...

01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:09.824
you've become a really good cook.

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:11.799
- Thanks, Dad.
- Not just for a kid.

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.959
I mean, you're really good.
You work really hard.

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:15.879
It's a big deal.

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:20.359
But we're gonna be home soon,
and we're gonna get back to our lives,

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:22.199
and I'm gonna be really
busy with the truck

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.319
and you're gonna be
really busy with school.

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.239
But I can still work
on the truck, right?

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:27.839
You said I was a good cook.

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:29.519
I'm... I'm sorry, Percy.

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:31.359
I... I just don't want
you to be disappointed

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.359
when things go back to
the way that they were.

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.783
I don't want it to go back to that.

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.319
I could work after
school and on weekends.

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.159
I just want to be
honest with you, OK?

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:43.719
I feel like I've let you down so much,
and I didn't want to blindside you,

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:47.799
but the summer's gonna end and we're
not gonna be doing this anymore.

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.319
OK?

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:51.629
OK.

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.279
But we had a lot of fun, and
nobody could take away from us

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:57.319
what we experienced
together, right?

01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:59.868
And I feel like I
really got to know you.

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:05.466
Alright. Let's watch the music.

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.747
<i>Well, if things don't
change around here</i>

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:16.311
<i>There ain't no use
in me hanging right on</i>

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.790
<i>Hang around</i>

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:22.262
<i>But I'll be ready now</i>

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:27.707
<i>I'll be ready when
my train pulls up</i>

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:33.861
<i>Well, I'll be ready now
Yeah</i>

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:37.989
<i>I'll be ready when
my train pulls in</i>

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:44.559
<i>I know my time ain't
long around...</i>

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:47.381
Alright, pal. Here we are.

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.359
- Be nice to be home.
- Yep.

01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:00.639
See your turtle, see your
mommy, back to your room.

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.108
I'm really gonna miss you.

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.199
I'm gonna miss you too.

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:11.039
OK, but you'll stay
with me in two weeks.

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.319
- OK?
- Yeah.

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:14.239
- Whole weekend.
- Did you post the video yet?

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:16.639
- I didn't look at it yet. Sorry.
- Don't forget.

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.119
- I won't.
- I'll resend it.

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:20.110
OK.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.239
Come on. Mommy misses you.

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.310
Go. Go to Mommy.

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:36.870
Mwah!

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:46.024
'Bye.

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.039
Oh, shit.

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:38.439
<i>- Wait a second.
- Gonna make...</i>

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.359
- Right, Dad?
- See you next week.

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.279
- Put that thing away.
- So I'm the nanny?

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.942
Here we go.

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:49.503
Hi.

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:53.388
- Look out.
- Oh!

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.719
- Empingao.
- Yeah!

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:02.479
- Park over there.
- Miami!

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.759
Come on, get in.

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:11.079
Arroz con pollo.

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:13.469
I think I missed the exit.

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.383
Beignets.

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:53.599
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.719
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:57.639
What's up?

01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.839
Listen, I was... I was thinking,
about what we were talking about.

01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:02.319
Yeah?

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:04.959
And it's gotta be OK with Mom.
Let me just say that first.

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.985
What are you talking about?

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:10.903
I could really use your
help on the truck.

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:15.679
You there?

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:17.159
Yeah.

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.999
And it's only for the
weekends and after school

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.479
after you're done
with your homework,

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.079
and the money goes into
your college fund.

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.599
OK. Does that sound good?

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.559
That sounds pretty good.

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:28.759
Mom! Dad wants me to
cook on his truck!

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:30.839
No, really! He's on the phone.

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:34.079
Mom wants to talk to you.
I think it's yes. Hang on.

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:04.199
Order 16. 16.

01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:06.623
- 16. 16, here.
- Thank you.

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:10.199
- 15.
- Order up. Order up. Next!

01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:12.439
Mole, two Cubanos,

01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:14.039
and order 21, slider.

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:15.519
- Thank you.
- 21? Thank you.

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:17.679
- There you go. I got yours coming.
- Perfect. 15.

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.989
- Yes.
- OK. Thank you.

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.239
There's no food for you here.

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.479
Could I speak to the chef
for just a second, please?

01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:27.470
The hell you will.

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.679
Can I talk to you?

01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:36.542
Next! Next!

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:43.439
What exactly are you doing here?

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.439
I'm, uh... eating the food.
I'm eating your food.

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.439
I thought my food was
needy and cloying.

01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:49.719
Well, I didn't think
you'd want to serve me,

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:52.119
so I sent somebody
else to pick it up.

01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:55.759
What happened between us,
that really knocked me for a loop.

01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:59.879
I mean, you robbed me of my pride
and my career and my dignity.

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:02.839
And I know people like you don't
usually care about that kind of thing.

01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.319
That's not necessarily true.

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.719
But you should know,
it hurts people like me.

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.239
- 'Cause we're really trying.
- You started a flame war with me.

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:12.479
Are you kidding me? I buy
ink by the barrel, buddy.

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.359
What are you doing
picking a fight with me?

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.039
I wouldn't challenge
you to a cook-off.

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:17.879
I thought I was sending
you a private message.

01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:20.479
I didn't know that.
I thought we were having fun.

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:23.799
It was theatre. By the way,
what the fuck were you cooking?

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.599
You totally shat the bed, buddy.
How could I back that?

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:29.239
You were one of my early boys.

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.999
I had no control over the menu.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.479
Whatever the case, OK? You seem
to be cooking for yourself again.

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:36.839
Because this shit is sensational.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:38.759
I mean, really, really good.

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.239
Thank you.

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.919
I'm not gonna write about it.

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.919
Yeah. I understand.

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.263
Because I'd like to back you.

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:49.319
Excuse me?

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:50.799
I wanna bankroll you,

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:53.239
and I can't write about anything
I have a vested interest in.

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.079
I'm not sure I get
what's going on here.

01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.119
I sold my website for
a whole lot of money

01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:59.559
and I've just put in a
bid on a place on Rose.

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:02.839
It's zoned, it's permitted. You could
build it out however you like.

01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:04.439
And you can cook whatever you like.

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.119
Take your time, think about it.

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.119
I wouldn't blame you for
having a few trust issues,

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.599
but I just thought that, you know,

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:11.839
you and me burying the hatchet
might be a good story.

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.599
Reservations out the door.

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.879
More importantly, you know, you
just cook your ass off in there.

01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:19.599
In the meantime, you just
tweet me wherever you are

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.079
and I'll come running.

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:23.582
'Cause this shit's good. Alright?

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.319
Delicious!

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:28.310
Delicioso.

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:30.799
Mucho goodo.

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.239
- Hey, jefe.
- Yeah?

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:34.439
That was a lot of talking
and you not punching him.

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.430
So, what'd that asshole say, huh?

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:39.399
I think that asshole might
be our new partner.

01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:15.150
Go, go, go, go

01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:34.959
Thank you!

01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:37.039
A mark. B mark.

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.039
Looks good. It looks good already.

01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:41.907
The heat is right on.

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:44.399
- That's olive oil?
- Yeah.

01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:46.119
What are you grabbing over there?

01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:48.110
You're grabbing all your cheese.

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:50.919
Yeah.

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:53.599
What are you doing there?
Spreading it around or finding...

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.519
- Spreading it around.
- What are you looking for there?

01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:57.319
Heat. Heat.

01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:59.119
So it doesn't burn?

01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:02.399
- Where's the hottest spot?
- Right here is the hot spot.

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:07.439
So you're controlling it all the time.
You're always controlling.

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:09.159
And you're looking, you're looking.

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:13.319
As soon as you get your good colour...
This is now where you start it.

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:17.142
You start to really build
the sandwich itself.

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:19.904
A light scrape.

01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:24.799
So you can see, the whole
sandwich starts to evolve.

01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:26.879
And, see, the cheese is
starting to evolve too.

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:29.519
Yes, you can do it. There you go.

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:31.510
Getting in there.

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.199
You're almost...

01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:35.799
Even now, as you get further, Jon,

01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:37.599
you're getting in,
like, assertive now.

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:40.239
You're changing...
Even your grip's here.

01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:42.039
- Mm-hm.
- Changing your positions.

01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.839
You're moving around.

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:46.679
But you're not too
busy with it. You're...

01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:49.399
You're precise, but then
sometimes you step back.

01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.719
- Nothing else exists except this.
- Right.

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:55.399
This is the only thing that
exists in this world right now.

01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:57.639
And if you fuck this up,
everything sucks in the world.
