taking every genealogists space.

01:04.819 --> 01:07.937
- None of that matters now.
- Look, it matters to me.

01:08.153 --> 01:11.395
It matters that the only other
person here is now crazy!

01:15.216 --> 01:19.799
- Protocol 214 B explains
procedures for when you go nuts!

01:20.404 --> 01:21.766
-It's complicated!

01:22.501 --> 01:24.808
And I need you to understand!
- You're acting crazy!

01:25.227 --> 01:26.227
-No!

01:36.952 --> 01:38.914
-What are you gonna do with those?

02:14.712 --> 02:18.661
-In May of 1941, the war had just begun.

02:19.100 --> 02:22.818
The Germans had the bigger ships,
they had the biggest guns,

02:23.436 --> 02:27.303
the Bismark was the fastest
ship that ever sailed the sea.

02:27.380 --> 02:31.306
On their decks were guns as big as steers
and shells as big as trees.

02:31.686 --> 02:35.658
Out of the cold and foggy
night, came the British ship The Hood.

02:36.038 --> 02:37.638
And every British seaman,

02:38.061 --> 02:39.688
he knew and understood,

02:40.202 --> 02:44.084
They had to sink the Bismark, the
terror of the sea ...Stop those guns.

02:44.224 --> 02:48.216
Stop those guns as big as steers
and the shells as big as trees.

02:48.812 --> 02:52.345
We'll find that German battleship
that's making such a fuss.

02:52.368 --> 02:56.521
We've got to sink the Bismark
'cause the world depends on us.

02:56.546 --> 03:00.752
Hit the decks a running boys
and spin those guns around,

03:00.776 --> 03:04.950
When we find the Bismark,
we got to cut her down.

03:08.359 --> 03:12.681
The Hood found the Bismark
and on that fatal day

03:13.241 --> 03:16.919
the Bismark started firing
fifteen miles away,

03:17.413 --> 03:21.292
we gotta sick the Bismark
was the battle sound.

03:21.538 --> 03:25.466
But when the smoke had cleared
away, the mighty Hood went down.

03:25.851 --> 03:29.665
For six long days and weary nights
they tried to find her trail.

03:30.077 --> 03:34.063
Churchill told the people
"Put every ship a-sail."

03:34.088 --> 03:38.452
'Cause somewhere on that
ocean I know she gotta be.

03:38.476 --> 03:42.338
We've got to sink the Bismark
to the bottom of the sea.

03:42.362 --> 03:46.339
We'll find that Ger, am battleship
that's making such a fuss.

03:46.363 --> 03:50.448

we gotta cut her down.

04:02.543 --> 04:06.799
The fog was gone the seventh day
and they saw the morning sun.

04:07.152 --> 04:10.819
Ten hours away from homeland
the Bismarck made it's run.

04:10.843 --> 04:15.269
The Admiral of the British fleet
said turn those bows around.

04:15.591 --> 04:19.591
We found that German battleship
and we're gonna cut her down.

04:21.685 --> 04:25.618
The British guns were aimed and
the shells were coming fast.

04:25.642 --> 04:29.844
The first shell hit the Bismarck
they knew she couldn't last.

04:29.869 --> 04:33.961
That mighty German
battleship is just a memory.

04:33.985 --> 04:38.329
Sink the Bismarck was the battle
cry that shook the seven seas.

04:38.353 --> 04:42.641
We found the German battleship
it was making such a fuss.

04:42.665 --> 04:46.827

Yeah we found the mighty Bismarck
and then we cut her down.

04:54.782 --> 04:58.696
We found the German battleship
it was making such a fuss.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.872
We had to sink the Bismark
'cause the world depends on us.

05:02.896 --> 05:06.864
We hit the deck a running and
we and spun those guns around.

05:06.888 --> 05:10.809
Yeah we found the mighty Bismarck
and then we cut her down.

05:16.716 --> 05:18.249
-What the hell is this?

07:38.860 --> 07:40.837
- I don't have the
card and not just the

07:40.862 --> 07:42.690
card, it's not that
it's your job...

07:42.891 --> 07:44.752
-It's your fault! You told me to tell her!

07:45.673 --> 07:47.740
-Now, look, I'm using the [???]!

07:48.743 --> 07:49.743
-I'm using the [???]

07:50.141 --> 07:52.608
-Alright, guys, don't argue about it.

07:52.632 --> 07:54.632
Wear something else and clean up for me.

07:55.290 --> 07:56.290
-With what?

07:58.470 --> 07:59.470
-Harold.

08:00.103 --> 08:01.303
Look what I found.

08:06.922 --> 08:07.922
-Standard issue.

08:08.845 --> 08:09.988
All flight kids have them.

08:12.548 --> 08:14.585
-Don't you think it's a little unnecessary

08:14.735 --> 08:16.668
in our... particular scenario?

08:24.063 --> 08:25.063
-Standard issue.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.295
Heard they were close.

09:05.410 --> 09:06.519
So far hunting blacks.

09:07.957 --> 09:10.067
Almost completely lost
sight of everything.

09:18.049 --> 09:21.760
- Has it occurred to you yet that our
distance is relative to growth?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.573
It's meaningless.

09:32.088 --> 09:33.288
How can I explain?

09:45.159 --> 09:47.759
It's like one of those... math problems.

09:48.533 --> 09:53.037
You know... if... if train A is
traveling east at 85 miles per hour,

09:53.280 --> 09:58.688
And train B is also heading
east at 85,000 miles per hour,

09:59.561 --> 10:02.293
at what point does train
A catch up with train B?

10:36.541 --> 10:37.866
<i>- You know, they never
give you anything for</i>

10:37.890 --> 10:39.690
<i>nothing in this world.
You gotta fight for it.</i>

10:39.970 --> 10:41.540
<i>All my life I've been a fighter.</i>

10:41.994 --> 10:44.001
<i>I fought for everything
I've got; I've fought for</i>

10:44.026 --> 10:45.952
<i>everything that's in here.
Fight, fight, fight.</i>

10:49.857 --> 10:51.622
<i>- The show must a lot for
letting them fight.</i>

10:56.927 --> 10:58.504
<i>-I got to get a name for the kids.</i>

11:29.476 --> 11:30.543
-Still straight?

11:34.749 --> 11:35.749
-Still away?

12:20.102 --> 12:21.302
-Hi, Lieutenant.

12:40.630 --> 12:45.150
<i>- Some people say a man
is made out of mud</i>

12:45.174 --> 12:48.629
<i>well a poor man's made
out of muscle and blood.</i>

12:48.872 --> 12:51.985
<i>Muscle and blood and skin and bone.</i>

12:52.341 --> 12:55.257
<i>A mind that's weak and
a back that's strong.</i>

12:55.282 --> 12:58.520
<i>You load 16 tons and whaddaya get??</i>

12:58.927 --> 13:01.394

<i>Saint Peter don'tcha call
me 'Cause I can't go</i>

13:05.364 --> 13:08.845
<i>I owe my soul to
the Company Store.</i>

13:14.020 --> 13:18.729
<i>I was born one morning
when sun didn't shine,</i>

13:18.752 --> 13:21.887
<i>I picked up my shovel
and I went to the mine,</i>

13:21.911 --> 13:23.911
<i>Loaded 16 tons of number nine coal,</i>

13:23.935 --> 13:28.314
<i>And the straw boss said:
"Well, bless my soul!"</i>

13:28.338 --> 13:31.367
<i>You load 16 tons,
And what do you get?</i>

13:31.391 --> 13:34.917
<i>Another day older,
And deeper in debt.</i>

13:34.942 --> 13:38.123
<i>Saint Peter, don't you
call me, Cause I can't go,</i>

13:38.146 --> 13:42.194
<i>I owe my soul to the company store.</i>

13:47.054 --> 13:51.684
<i>I was born one morning,
it was drizzling rain,</i>

13:51.708 --> 13:55.113
<i>Fighting and Trouble are my middle name,</i>

13:55.137 --> 13:58.454
<i>I was raised down the Canebrake
by an old mountain mine, And</i>

13:58.479 --> 14:01.632
<i>there ain't no hard-hearted
women make me walk that line!</i>

14:01.657 --> 14:04.789
<i>You load 16 tons,
And what do you get?</i>

14:04.813 --> 14:08.105

the company store.</i>

14:21.585 --> 14:26.130
<i>If you see me coming,
you better step aside,</i>

14:26.154 --> 14:29.417
<i>A lot of men didn't and a lot of men died.</i>

14:29.816 --> 14:32.749
<i>My one fist of iron, the
other one of steel,</i>

14:32.774 --> 14:35.880

14:35.904 --> 14:39.302

What the hell was that?

15:53.218 --> 15:54.218
Harold?!

15:56.187 --> 15:57.187
What was that?!

15:59.976 --> 16:00.976
Harold!

16:03.046 --> 16:04.046
Harold?

16:05.312 --> 16:06.512
Damn it. Harold...

16:08.882 --> 16:09.882
Harold?!

16:26.228 --> 16:28.495
<i>- You're the one who
aggravates me.</i>

16:29.728 --> 16:31.252
-I know.

16:31.877 --> 16:35.077
I've seen this one already.
That's the one where

16:35.666 --> 16:38.941
he thinks his friend is dead, but
he's really just asleep. It's like...

16:39.408 --> 16:42.467
he puts on this makeshift
pre-stuffed and starts

16:43.236 --> 16:45.303
reading this guy's last rights.

16:47.716 --> 16:50.249
When the dummy finally wakes up, he...

16:50.856 --> 16:53.613
he starts freaking out because
he thinks he's dying and...

17:00.131 --> 17:01.797
you're not gonna wake up.

17:04.709 --> 17:06.933
<i>- Red said that all the
guys like me down there.</i>

17:08.467 --> 17:10.800
<i>-Baby, you got to quit.</i>

18:13.749 --> 18:14.749
-What a drag.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.605
You ain't coming back.

20:12.624 --> 20:14.424
That's what I'm asking you!

20:17.937 --> 20:19.203
How does this work?

20:57.150 --> 20:58.150
Still straight.

20:59.976 --> 21:00.976
Still away.

22:50.234 --> 22:51.374
Straight and away.

26:13.893 --> 26:16.213
<i>- blue line... does it have
anything to do with the color?</i>

26:16.598 --> 26:19.801
<i>-No, it doesn't. Just keep it down flat.</i>

26:20.106 --> 26:22.106
<i>You can't do it? You home?</i>

26:22.864 --> 26:24.902
<i>-No, this is good. I look like a statue.</i>

26:25.796 --> 26:26.796
<i>-I got that.</i>

26:28.006 --> 26:31.000
<i>Now, a little bit on the lighter side.</i>

26:31.913 --> 26:33.456
<i>Sometime after the</i>

26:34.389 --> 26:36.956
<i>courageous launch of ISRA 88,</i>

26:37.717 --> 26:41.987
<i>Dr. Abe Anderson and Lt.
Col. Harold Richards</i>

26:42.155 --> 26:44.937
<i>continue their voyage through space.</i>

26:46.124 --> 26:49.247
<i>Here with us tonight...
via two satellites...</i>

26:49.984 --> 26:53.406
<i>Dr. Abe Anderson and Lt.
Col. Harold Richards.</i>

26:54.570 --> 26:55.837
<i>Gentlemen, welcome.</i>

26:56.313 --> 26:58.117
<i>And please tell us: how are you?</i>

27:01.530 --> 27:02.866
<i>-Hello, Mr. Westin!</i>

27:04.124 --> 27:05.514
<i>I'm... I'm doing really great.</i>

27:05.952 --> 27:07.352
<i>Thank you for asking.</i>

27:08.507 --> 27:10.561
<i>-Good... um, so...</i>

27:11.679 --> 27:16.145
<i>years in, Doctor, what do you and
your pilot do to pass the time?</i>

27:19.422 --> 27:20.422
<i>-Um...</i>

27:20.985 --> 27:23.785
<i>well, a secondary objective of our mission</i>

27:24.399 --> 27:25.586
<i>was to observe</i>

27:25.922 --> 27:29.253
<i>the effects of zero gravity on the
flight patterns of honey bees.</i>

27:30.735 --> 27:32.401
<i>Those bees recently died.</i>

27:32.985 --> 27:34.805
<i>So our results are inconclusive.</i>

27:36.696 --> 27:38.762
<i>Uh, either than that we... um...</i>

27:39.258 --> 27:41.001
<i>we have a hard drive full of old TV.</i>

27:43.094 --> 27:44.967
<i>-We had a pinball machine, but that...</i>

27:46.915 --> 27:47.915
<i>Broke.</i>

27:49.829 --> 27:51.836
<i>-Oh, well...</i>

27:52.407 --> 27:53.607
<i>one more question,</i>

27:53.790 --> 27:55.836
<i>uh...[indistinct]</i>

28:00.417 --> 28:01.684
<i>-I... I... I'm sorry.</i>

28:02.245 --> 28:05.471
<i>Mr. White, could you repeat that?
We have some static on our end.</i>

28:06.909 --> 28:10.004
<i>-Sure. Any sign of your main objective?</i>

28:11.120 --> 28:13.182
<i>Any sign of the end of the universe?</i>

28:16.026 --> 28:17.026
<i>-Um... um...</i>

28:18.355 --> 28:19.355
<i>no, sir.</i>

28:19.823 --> 28:22.714
<i>We think it will be much, much
longer before we see the end.</i>

28:23.769 --> 28:26.260
<i>The only... sign we can predict</i>

28:26.894 --> 28:28.227
<i>will come before our</i>

28:28.831 --> 28:32.819
<i>destination is the total
loss of sights of all stars.</i>

28:33.894 --> 28:38.887
<i>Um... and even if this occurs, we have no
idea how much longer our trip will be.</i>

28:40.761 --> 28:42.761
<i>-That's interesting. well, it, uh... oh!</i>

28:43.089 --> 28:45.182
<i>It's... I guess we're out of time.
So, I would</i>

28:45.207 --> 28:47.162
<i>like to thank you
gentlemen for joining us</i>

28:47.729 --> 28:49.659
<i>and we wish you a safe...
- Goodnight.</i>

28:49.684 --> 28:50.789
<i>- and successful journey.</i>

28:51.839 --> 28:52.839
<i>Goodnight.</i>

29:17.845 --> 29:21.238
<i>-So the disk is above the blue line.</i>

29:21.261 --> 29:22.976
<i>Does it got anything
to do with the color?</i>

29:23.001 --> 29:25.603
<i>- No. I suppose.
Just keep it down flat.</i>

29:25.967 --> 29:28.226
<i>I can't do this. You in?</i>

29:28.540 --> 29:31.207
<i>-No, this is good. I look like a statue.</i>

29:31.969 --> 29:32.969
<i>-I don't know.</i>

29:34.125 --> 29:35.525
<i>Well, a little bit...</i>

29:38.055 --> 29:41.445
<i>- Some time after the courageous
launch is premeditated,</i>

<i>Dr. Abe Anderson</i>

29:46.727 --> 29:47.727

<i>I'm... I'm doing really great.
Thank you for asking.</i>

30:12.383 --> 30:20.170
- <i>So, uh... years in, Doctor, what do
you and your pilot do to pass the time?</i>

31:44.817 --> 31:46.578
-Follow the Ophthalmoscope, please.

31:47.177 --> 31:48.802
¿Cómo Se siente, Dr. Anderson?

31:49.161 --> 31:51.473
- Oh... okay.
- You're like Lewis and Clark.

31:52.466 --> 31:54.700
- General Christie has a few things
he would like to make clear.

31:54.724 --> 31:55.755
-Three.

31:55.780 --> 31:58.872
- What I am most curious
about is the Multiverse.

31:59.059 --> 32:01.022
- First and foremost we
would like to thank you.

32:01.372 --> 32:03.473
Your bravery for this
mission is commendable.

32:04.212 --> 32:08.874
Your participation in this task is both
strategic and necessary for the advancement

32:08.898 --> 32:11.649
of the U.S. Military...
- Of course. There's always a possibility

32:11.673 --> 32:13.068
of cosmic uncertainty.

32:13.351 --> 32:16.361
- Furthermore, the would like to remind
you you are still a private citizen.

32:17.195 --> 32:20.140
As science officer, you
hold no military authority,

32:20.164 --> 32:23.158
nor do you represent this
country, continent or planet.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.133
Under no circumstances
are you to act as a

32:26.158 --> 32:28.029
representative for people
of the United States

32:28.053 --> 32:30.583
-The universe is more contained
than we originally thought.

32:31.340 --> 32:35.873
I thought it was going to curve like
the bell of a trumpet...or...or

32:36.394 --> 32:39.972
spill out and spread like
water from a hose, but

32:41.003 --> 32:43.778
-...you will follow military protocol.
All forms will first go

32:43.803 --> 32:46.621
through General Christie before
being submitted to publication.

32:46.645 --> 32:48.855
-Tiene pies pequeños.
-...in accordance with section...15

32:48.879 --> 32:51.214
-Just doesn't add up. Don't underestimate

32:52.019 --> 32:53.219
fictional realism.

32:53.308 --> 32:56.948
-Quite frankly sir, the U.S. military
has final edit on all publications.

32:57.675 --> 33:00.211
Including but not limited
to all news media,

33:00.236 --> 33:01.909
print-magazine and newspaper,

33:01.932 --> 33:02.886
-Unresponsive?
-...as well as scientific...

33:02.911 --> 33:05.360
-We're working with
theoretical numbers here.

33:05.385 --> 33:07.568
Right? I mean, this
is beyond imaginary.

33:08.183 --> 33:09.450
If you can imagine.

33:09.722 --> 33:11.609
-If we deem your discoveries detrimental

33:11.777 --> 33:14.299
to the safety of this
country, continent or planet,

33:14.699 --> 33:16.316
it will be deemed classified.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.745
Here are your release and waiver forms.

33:18.769 --> 33:20.339
-Levante su brazo, por favor.

33:23.347 --> 33:24.347
-Yes?

33:25.152 --> 33:27.034
Yes! Doctor...

33:29.505 --> 33:30.505
-Anderson.

33:32.146 --> 33:33.146
Doctor Abe

33:33.365 --> 33:34.431
Anderson.
-Yes.

33:34.896 --> 33:36.229
Doctor Abe Anderson.

33:36.576 --> 33:40.617
I hope most of you have had the opportunity
to read Dr.Anderson's publication.

33:41.216 --> 33:42.497
Yield Electricity.

33:43.224 --> 33:44.424
A marvelous piece.

33:45.310 --> 33:47.364
Come down; come on down.

33:47.966 --> 33:48.966
Mhmm...

33:52.412 --> 33:55.797
This two manned mission is the
most advanced of its kind.

33:56.420 --> 33:59.753
The data we have collected
thus far is remarkable.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.233
And we're not even in space yet.

34:02.257 --> 34:07.345
-Yes, but...isn't the data theoretical?
It just seems too early.

34:07.654 --> 34:09.853
-Well, that's exactly it, doctor.

34:10.443 --> 34:13.505
All we have at this point are
theories and hypotheses.

34:14.458 --> 34:15.458
Sir,

34:15.833 --> 34:18.817
this is the greatest abstract
question of our world.

34:19.389 --> 34:22.255
And we have a chance for a physical answer.

34:22.630 --> 34:24.810
-It just seems like an unnecessary risk.

34:25.178 --> 34:26.178
-It is a risk

34:26.826 --> 34:27.826
we should take.

34:30.951 --> 34:34.746
This seems like the best time to
introduce Lt. Col. Harold Richards.

34:36.447 --> 34:40.580
The military said something about
equal parts brain and brawn,

34:41.094 --> 34:44.257
and so Lt. Col. Richards will
be piloting out mission.

34:52.955 --> 34:54.688
With our collective minds,

34:55.016 --> 34:57.217
and the bravery of these two men,

34:57.939 --> 34:59.606
we can reach any distance

35:00.431 --> 35:02.306
and find every answer.

35:03.548 --> 35:04.548
Together,

35:05.236 --> 35:07.485
we will pursue as Kennedy said.

35:08.666 --> 35:10.199
Not because it is easy,

35:12.017 --> 35:13.551
but because it is hard.

35:19.502 --> 35:21.500
There is much we can discuss.

35:22.314 --> 35:24.860
Abe, you're gonna need to
brush up on your math,

35:25.509 --> 35:27.005
And...uh, Harold,

35:27.666 --> 35:30.605
you're gonna need to discuss your protocol.

35:33.228 --> 35:35.956
You got your PhD in marine biology.
Is that correct?

35:36.986 --> 35:38.290
-Yes.
-Well...

35:38.877 --> 35:40.720
I think you'll find that, uh...

35:41.119 --> 35:42.650
floating in space is

35:43.353 --> 35:45.235
kind of like floating in the ocean.

35:49.731 --> 35:51.183
-Levante El brazo, por favor.

35:52.434 --> 35:53.973
-He's fainted. Grab the salts.

35:54.247 --> 35:55.380
-Possibly stress.

35:55.637 --> 35:57.684
The man has been under great stress.

36:01.309 --> 36:03.441
-Please finish...signing the form, sir.

36:03.926 --> 36:04.926
-Abe...

36:04.997 --> 36:07.785
puede hacer una cuenta regresiva
desde tres, por favor?

36:08.224 --> 36:09.690
-What's you last name?

36:10.513 --> 36:13.245
-I'm going to have to allow
fir his low stress efficiency.

36:18.482 --> 36:19.559
-Thank you, doctor.

36:20.301 --> 36:21.629
Your country thanks you.

36:22.411 --> 36:23.676
-Come on, lieutenant colonel!

36:23.700 --> 36:26.433
You've been pushing papers so long
you forgot how to run!

36:26.708 --> 36:28.600
Being in the force is
like a day at the fair.

36:28.825 --> 36:32.040
Except it's all ups and downs and
none of that delicious cotton candy.

36:32.442 --> 36:33.590
-What's with the squid?

36:34.192 --> 36:35.887
-He passed out during the exam.

36:37.247 --> 36:38.580
-Richards...welcome.

36:38.974 --> 36:41.922
We're just going over some
science stuff. You know?

36:42.450 --> 36:44.801
-I'll have some forms for you to
sign later, lieutenant colonel.

36:45.372 --> 36:46.700
You have to toughen up.

36:47.177 --> 36:49.586
We'll be reaching three,
pushing four G's on takeoff.

36:50.802 --> 36:53.269
-I was... never very good at physics.

36:54.528 --> 36:55.595
-You're alright.

36:56.857 --> 36:58.661
Takeoff's gonna be really though, though.

37:00.997 --> 37:01.997
-Well...

37:03.224 --> 37:04.347
let me look at you two.

37:05.739 --> 37:07.606
let me look at the spacemen.

37:13.841 --> 37:15.613
-He's...fainted again?

38:16.621 --> 38:18.050
-That's gonna be annoying.

38:19.277 --> 38:21.771
So much easier when things are automated.

38:21.858 --> 38:23.271
When things stop working,

38:24.334 --> 38:25.334
sometimes.

38:28.483 --> 38:29.818
you gotta do it yourself.

39:23.870 --> 39:25.537
-You know, I saw this video once

39:25.784 --> 39:27.184
where an electric eel

39:27.745 --> 39:29.078
killed an alligator.

39:31.128 --> 39:33.830
The eel swam up to the
gator and kind of just...

39:34.448 --> 39:35.448
just taunts him

39:36.307 --> 39:37.307
until the gator

39:37.940 --> 39:40.273
sinks its teeth right into the eel.

39:42.292 --> 39:45.371
It takes you a second to realize the
gator isn't in control anymore.

39:46.894 --> 39:48.561
The gator starts seizing.

39:49.402 --> 39:50.868
Then he finally stops.

39:52.908 --> 39:55.524
-Do you have a problem...with
me feeding them?

39:57.509 --> 39:58.909
They seem to like it.

40:03.503 --> 40:05.333
-Just doesn't really seem like you.

40:06.550 --> 40:08.150
Not following procedure.

40:12.761 --> 40:13.761
Your funeral.

40:26.074 --> 40:27.707
<i>-Where's my five
dollars allowance?</i>

40:29.699 --> 40:32.347
<i>-You got to use your own money
or you don't have any allowance.</i>

40:32.372 --> 40:33.977
<i>-What money? I ain’t got any money.</i>

40:34.175 --> 40:37.228
<i>You think I'd just bring it up?
I get five dollars.</i>

40:37.492 --> 40:40.616
<i>-Well, I did...but I have to save
your five dollars on the dentist.</i>

40:40.718 --> 40:41.718
-Oh...good.

40:42.242 --> 40:43.242
You're alive.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.903
Dumb...but alive.

40:48.483 --> 40:49.991
-What's that supposed to mean?

40:58.175 --> 41:01.685
-He shows that line all the time
but never really hits her.

44:22.563 --> 44:24.483
-Do you know what any
of those things do?

44:27.360 --> 44:28.874
That button you just pushed.

44:29.852 --> 44:30.852
What's it do?

44:32.970 --> 44:34.036
-Doesn't matter.

44:34.360 --> 44:36.422
-Ah...I see.

44:38.462 --> 44:39.662
-Ship's gotta run,

44:40.126 --> 44:41.516
and I gotta run this ship.

44:42.196 --> 44:43.516
-No, you don't.

44:45.259 --> 44:46.743
Everything here is automated.

44:47.895 --> 44:50.246
What makes you think this
ship doesn't fly itself?

44:50.684 --> 44:52.134
Why would they
leave that to you?

45:00.958 --> 45:02.558
Don't push that one! No1

45:03.817 --> 45:05.402
-What are you talking about?

45:06.676 --> 45:08.276
-let's see what happens.

45:10.676 --> 45:12.356
-Now, isn't that against procedure?

45:12.825 --> 45:14.866
I certainly don't wanna
find out what happens.

45:14.921 --> 45:17.978
-Oh, it's good for you. Risks are good.

45:18.002 --> 45:19.199
-Shut up.

45:20.012 --> 45:21.472
You don't do any call around here.

45:21.645 --> 45:24.482
Just because you realize you're
useless, doesn't mean that I am!

45:25.496 --> 45:27.166
I fly this ship!

45:38.346 --> 45:39.346
-You hit me!

45:43.768 --> 45:45.568
You didn't push the button.

45:50.562 --> 45:51.829
We're still moving!

45:52.625 --> 45:53.625
Aren't we?

45:59.828 --> 46:01.320
None of this stuff matters.

46:02.943 --> 46:08.143
Everything is pre-programmed. We are moving
through space and we'll never stop.

46:08.927 --> 46:12.860
We keep going through the same
motions over and over again.

46:14.658 --> 46:16.353
And we're not changing anything.

49:48.111 --> 49:49.178
-What did you do?

49:53.205 --> 49:55.338
Where did you hide the sardines?

49:58.947 --> 50:00.547
-I sent them into space.

50:04.814 --> 50:06.081
You already hit me.

51:08.303 --> 51:10.036
<i>-Country smokehouse jerky.</i>

51:10.326 --> 51:12.526
<i>Good in the home or on the trail.</i>

51:12.810 --> 51:14.077
<i>Country smokehouse.</i>

53:08.539 --> 53:10.461
-Can I get everyone's attention, please?

53:12.024 --> 53:13.024
Uh...

53:16.196 --> 53:17.462
I know that...uh...

53:17.797 --> 53:20.728
history books are going to re...recount
the...the two-manned mission

53:22.289 --> 53:24.556
to the end of the universe...uh...

53:24.821 --> 53:29.699
But...we just...we wanna make
sure that...that you all know

53:30.360 --> 53:32.704
that it's because of your
contributions and your hard work,

53:34.149 --> 53:35.555
that's what put us there.

53:36.180 --> 53:38.359
Alright, so...um...a toast?

53:38.610 --> 53:40.610
-Sounds good.
-Yeah...

54:04.182 --> 54:06.116
Raise your little booze bags.

54:09.245 --> 54:11.445
-[all together] To space!
-Yeah!

54:12.800 --> 54:13.933
-Like that?
-Oh.

54:15.831 --> 54:18.120
-Oh, it's bad.
-Alright, congratulations.

54:18.761 --> 54:21.161
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

54:21.185 --> 54:23.185
-Ah, what a job well done.

54:25.761 --> 54:26.902
- (Whispering) To space.

54:27.928 --> 54:29.794
-MAN: Good job. Really good.

57:10.728 --> 57:13.373
-In 1814 we took a
little trip Along with

57:13.398 --> 57:16.231
Colonel Jackson down the
mighty Mississippi.

57:16.255 --> 57:18.255
We took a little bacon and
we took a little beans

57:18.279 --> 57:21.487
and we caught the bloody British
in the town of New Orleans.

57:21.511 --> 57:24.124
We fired our guns and the
British kept a-comin'.

57:24.149 --> 57:26.975
There wasn't nigh' as many
as there was a while ago.

57:26.999 --> 57:29.749
We fired once more and
they began to runnin'

57:29.773 --> 57:32.440
On down the Mississippi
to the Gulf of Mexico.

57:34.710 --> 57:37.601
We looked down the river and
we seed the British comin'.

57:37.625 --> 57:40.717
And there must have been a hundred
of 'em beatin' on the drum.

57:40.741 --> 57:43.623
They stepped so high and
they made the bugles ring.

57:43.647 --> 57:45.917
We stood behind our cotton
bales and didn't say a thing.

57:45.942 --> 57:48.746
We fired our guns and the
British kept a-comin'.

57:48.770 --> 57:51.380
There wasn't nigh' as many
as there was a while ago.

57:51.404 --> 57:54.231
We fired once more and
they began to runnin'

57:54.255 --> 57:56.820
On down the Mississippi
to the Gulf of Mexico.

57:58.704 --> 58:01.771
Old Hickory said we could
take 'em by surprise

58:01.795 --> 58:05.042
if we didn't fire our muskets
'till we looked 'em in the eyes.

58:05.065 --> 58:07.848
We held our fire till we
seed their faces well

58:07.873 --> 58:10.980
then we opened up our squirrel
guns and gave 'em... Well we

58:11.004 --> 58:14.033
 fired our guns and the
British kept a-comin'.

58:14.057 --> 58:16.533
There wasn't nigh' as many
as there was a while ago.

58:16.557 --> 58:19.392
We fired once more and
they began to runnin'

58:19.416 --> 58:21.882
On down the Mississippi
to the Gulf of Mexico.

58:24.184 --> 58:27.301
Yeah they ran through the briers
and they ran through the brambles

58:27.324 --> 58:29.959
And they ran through the bushes
where a rabbit couldn't go.

58:29.984 --> 58:33.058
They ran so fast that the
hounds couldn't catch 'em.

58:33.082 --> 58:35.555
On down the Mississippi
to the Gulf of Mexico.

58:40.764 --> 58:43.240
We fired our cannon till
the barrel melted down

58:43.264 --> 58:46.163
So we grabbed an alligator
and we fought another round.

58:46.187 --> 58:48.970
We filled his head with cannonballs
'n' powdered his behind,

58:48.994 --> 58:51.759
and when we took the powder
off, the gator lost its mind

58:51.784 --> 58:54.433
We fired our guns and the
British kept a-comin'.

58:54.457 --> 58:57.055
There wasn't nigh' as many
as there was a while ago.

58:57.079 --> 58:59.848
We fired once more and
they began to runnin'

58:59.872 --> 59:02.385
On down the Mississippi
to the Gulf of Mexico.

59:04.303 --> 59:07.889
Yeah they ran through the briers
and they ran through the brambles

59:07.913 --> 59:10.563
And they ran through the bushes
where a rabbit couldn't go.

59:10.587 --> 59:13.366
They ran so fast that the
hounds couldn't catch 'em.

59:13.390 --> 59:15.918
On down the Mississippi
to the Gulf of Mexico.

59:17.073 --> 59:19.276
Hut, hut, three, four

59:19.300 --> 59:21.452
Sound off, three. four

59:21.477 --> 59:24.393
Hut, hut, three, four

59:24.417 --> 59:26.754
Sound off, three. four.

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:29.042
-Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train

01:02:29.686 --> 01:02:32.219
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home

01:02:33.303 --> 01:02:35.436
My baby just-a wrote me a letter

01:02:36.514 --> 01:02:39.247
I don't care how much money I gotta spend

And look...

01:13:02.713 --> 01:13:04.080
I made us matching bracelets.

01:13:04.752 --> 01:13:05.819

01:13:06.237 --> 01:13:08.806

worked hard on these.

01:13:11.924 --> 01:13:14.189

<i>-It's a honeybee!</i>

01:18:33.167 --> 01:18:35.834
-In May of 1941, the war had just begun.

01:18:36.737 --> 01:18:40.585
The Germans had the bigger ships,
they had the biggest guns,

01:18:40.609 --> 01:18:44.867
the Bismark was the fastest
ship that ever sailed the sea.

01:18:44.891 --> 01:18:49.022
On their decks were guns as big as steers
and shells as big as trees.

01:18:49.046 --> 01:18:53.324
Out of the cold and foggy
night, came the British ship The Hood.

01:18:53.348 --> 01:18:57.474
And every British seaman,
he knew and understood,

01:18:57.498 --> 01:19:01.394
They had to sink the Bismark, the
terror of the sea ...

01:19:01.419 --> 01:19:05.935
Stop those guns as big as steers
and the shells as big as trees.

01:19:05.959 --> 01:19:10.003
We'll find that German battleship
that's makin' such a fuss

01:19:10.027 --> 01:19:13.872
We gotta sink the Bismark because
the world depends on us.

01:19:13.896 --> 01:19:18.158
Hit those decks a-runnin' boys
and spin those guns around.

01:19:18.182 --> 01:19:21.986
When we find the Bismark,
we gotta cut her down.

01:19:22.482 --> 01:19:24.153
-What is tonight's meal?

01:19:24.584 --> 01:19:25.651
-New York Diner.

01:19:26.115 --> 01:19:27.248
Burnt and watery.

01:19:28.428 --> 01:19:30.971
-Yep...just like mom's back home.

01:19:32.357 --> 01:19:34.365
-What do you got on the
agenda for today, Doc?

01:19:34.779 --> 01:19:36.680
-Oh, mostly working
with the bees today.

01:19:37.631 --> 01:19:39.552
The hive's almost ready
for another harvest.

01:19:39.912 --> 01:19:42.045
-I love that space honey.
-Hmm.

01:19:48.139 --> 01:19:49.139
-Space...

01:21:03.547 --> 01:21:04.547
-That was close.

01:22:48.991 --> 01:22:49.991
-Hi captain.

01:22:51.655 --> 01:22:52.655
-If only.

01:22:58.568 --> 01:23:00.223
-How's the ship?
-Still straight.

01:23:00.256 --> 01:23:02.107
Still away. How're the bees?

01:23:02.372 --> 01:23:04.372
-Still busy...still buzzing.

01:23:05.334 --> 01:23:07.639
We're harvesting tomorrow.
-Space honey!

01:23:07.905 --> 01:23:08.905
Yes!

01:23:22.314 --> 01:23:23.743
-You know how this thing works?

01:23:24.127 --> 01:23:26.767
-Yeah. I mean...kinda.

01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:31.230
It's like a...jet ski.

01:23:32.244 --> 01:23:33.244
But with space.

01:23:34.205 --> 01:23:36.605
All that government funding
for a giant jet ski.

01:23:39.744 --> 01:23:41.211
How fast are we going?

01:23:49.643 --> 01:23:53.149
-Anything less than 330 million
and I'm supposed to be concerned.

01:23:55.869 --> 01:23:56.869
-That's fast.

01:23:57.807 --> 01:23:59.607
-Faster than my '69 Cuda back home.

01:24:35.965 --> 01:24:38.238
-You'd think being stuck inside
that room with all those

01:24:38.263 --> 01:24:40.295
buttons and lights and
switches you'd have enough.

01:24:41.207 --> 01:24:43.229
-No. No high score.

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:45.496
Demmit!

01:24:47.652 --> 01:24:48.852
You distracted me.

01:24:54.492 --> 01:24:55.749
7 million...

01:24:56.312 --> 01:24:57.929
145...

01:24:59.125 --> 01:25:00.125
thousand, 600.

01:25:01.562 --> 01:25:02.896
Hey, you're up, doc.

01:25:03.101 --> 01:25:04.780
-Nah, don't feel like playing tonight.

01:25:05.125 --> 01:25:06.761
-Forfeit? Victory.

01:25:07.039 --> 01:25:08.335
-Ah...standard issue.

01:25:14.937 --> 01:25:18.011
So I suppose  Ralph Kramden...

01:25:18.449 --> 01:25:20.197
Kramden is standard issue as well.

01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:56.247
-In May of 1941, the war had just begun.

01:25:57.429 --> 01:25:58.629
-It's harvest day.

01:25:59.726 --> 01:26:01.766
This year's crop is sure
to make us through winter.

01:26:03.148 --> 01:26:04.148
-Space honey.

01:26:05.101 --> 01:26:07.500
I'll have to go down to cargo
and get some extra bread.

01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:55.155
-Well, that was easy.

01:27:57.593 --> 01:27:59.702
Looks like I have this down to a science.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.320
What the hell?

01:28:16.292 --> 01:28:17.292
Harold?

01:28:19.246 --> 01:28:20.246
Harold?!

01:28:27.450 --> 01:28:28.783
-Abe, I'm on my way!

01:28:30.169 --> 01:28:31.169
-Hey Harold,

01:28:31.677 --> 01:28:32.677
check this out.

01:28:34.707 --> 01:28:35.707
-God bless it, Abe.

01:28:36.364 --> 01:28:37.964
-I've never had a beard.

01:29:04.252 --> 01:29:05.822
-I didn't expect to see you up here.

01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:09.189
-I don't...like to

01:29:10.682 --> 01:29:12.143
go... up here.

01:29:15.668 --> 01:29:16.668
-Wait...

01:29:17.543 --> 01:29:18.543
if you're here,

01:29:20.246 --> 01:29:21.690
and I'm here,

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:25.860
who is flying the ship?!

01:29:29.416 --> 01:29:31.103
That was supposed to be funny.

01:29:31.705 --> 01:29:33.039
-Well, it was funny.

01:29:41.026 --> 01:29:43.269
I don't understand how you can

01:29:44.689 --> 01:29:47.083
come up here...every day.

01:29:47.107 --> 01:29:48.262
-Well, it's not bad.

01:29:49.743 --> 01:29:51.689
I just look at all the
stars and planets.

01:29:53.282 --> 01:29:54.749
I don't see emptiness.

01:29:58.703 --> 01:30:00.013
It's like we're the pinball

01:30:00.851 --> 01:30:02.680
and we're flying past all the bumpers.

01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:06.783
I think it's beautiful.

01:30:09.617 --> 01:30:11.350
-Not as pretty as my wife.

01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:19.390
-Why did you take this mission?

01:30:23.414 --> 01:30:25.014
-My country asked me to.

01:30:26.625 --> 01:30:27.990
-That's quite the sacrifice.

01:30:32.024 --> 01:30:34.592
-There was... a great tax
break for my family.

01:30:36.008 --> 01:30:37.475
I couldn't pass it up.

01:30:39.225 --> 01:30:40.225
You?

01:30:43.311 --> 01:30:44.711
-Science asked me to?

01:30:46.201 --> 01:30:47.401
-What's out there?

01:30:48.568 --> 01:30:50.539
-I know it's more than anyone expected.

01:30:52.404 --> 01:30:54.591
There could be other realities out there.

01:30:56.381 --> 01:30:58.514
A <i>completely</i> different universe.

01:31:30.453 --> 01:31:32.345
-Careful...you don't wanna tilt.

01:31:33.226 --> 01:31:35.523
-I am unstoppable right now.

01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:39.820
Damn.

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:41.828
-Damn?

01:31:44.031 --> 01:31:47.462
9 million, 989 thousand,

01:31:47.953 --> 01:31:49.071
423?

01:31:50.203 --> 01:31:51.867
You almost maxed out the machine.

01:31:53.187 --> 01:31:56.321
-Some men need heavy
hammers, give me flippers.

01:31:56.927 --> 01:31:59.356
-So...uh, where is it, doc?

01:31:59.809 --> 01:32:01.910
-Ah, space honey?

01:32:02.606 --> 01:32:06.028
-Some men need flippers,
give me space honey.

01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:11.287
Want some?
-Oh, no.

01:32:12.397 --> 01:32:15.092
I've had plenty today. I
can...feel my teeth rotting.

01:32:18.670 --> 01:32:20.664
Do you really get a tax
break for being here?

01:32:22.045 --> 01:32:23.445
-Well, my family did.

01:32:24.030 --> 01:32:25.381
You didn't?
-No.

01:32:25.827 --> 01:32:27.592
No one said anything
about taxes.

01:32:28.795 --> 01:32:30.248
-You're really here
for the science?

01:32:30.506 --> 01:32:31.506
-Yes.

01:32:36.170 --> 01:32:39.037
-Damn, doc, how could
you've ever left that?

01:32:41.061 --> 01:32:42.061
-She left me.

01:32:44.038 --> 01:32:46.568
I wanted to get as far away
from there as I could.

01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:50.797
Time can heal pain.

01:32:58.647 --> 01:33:00.216
I'm gonna try and train those bees.

01:33:03.536 --> 01:33:05.602
-What? Like "roll over"? "Sit"?

01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:09.228
-I think it'd be similar
to carrier pigeons.

01:34:47.265 --> 01:34:48.265
-You're up.

01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:15.140
-Hey, Harold.

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:18.514
I've got some...

01:35:18.968 --> 01:35:20.301
sort of new special.

01:35:22.976 --> 01:35:25.579
Don't touch the table!
Don't touch the table.

01:35:25.602 --> 01:35:26.975
-Sorry.

01:35:27.983 --> 01:35:29.983
-Gotta be free of controversy.

01:35:30.148 --> 01:35:32.281
Concentrate.
-Don't even breathe!

01:35:33.975 --> 01:35:36.220
-Fingers are cramping.
-Stay on target.

01:35:48.883 --> 01:35:50.437
Why's it still making that noise?

01:35:50.891 --> 01:35:52.091
-Maybe I broke it.

01:35:55.852 --> 01:35:57.894
-No. You better not have broke it.

01:36:01.539 --> 01:36:03.339
-Do you still hear beeping?

01:36:50.535 --> 01:36:51.535
-Doc!

01:36:53.003 --> 01:36:55.546
Doc! there's something
wrong with the bee...tank.

01:36:59.144 --> 01:37:00.411
-The bees are dead.

01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.200
-Hey Harold...

01:37:19.528 --> 01:37:20.536
Harold...

01:37:24.346 --> 01:37:25.346
-Yeah, buddy?

01:37:26.018 --> 01:37:27.018
-Are you awake?

01:37:30.041 --> 01:37:31.041
-Sure.

01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:32.510
-Yeah, me, too.

01:37:36.822 --> 01:37:37.955
-Something wrong?

01:37:39.424 --> 01:37:40.424
-I don't know.

01:37:43.713 --> 01:37:45.439
-Is it...the bees again?

01:37:46.401 --> 01:37:48.049
-No, they're actually thriving.

01:37:49.627 --> 01:37:50.894
I just can't sleep.

01:37:59.239 --> 01:38:01.239
-I didn't sleep well as a kid.

01:38:04.184 --> 01:38:06.051
Military bases are always...

01:38:08.512 --> 01:38:09.512
awake.

01:38:13.559 --> 01:38:16.749
My mother used to tell me to...think of
something that makes you really happy.

01:38:17.348 --> 01:38:18.348
Really relaxed.

01:38:20.145 --> 01:38:22.551
Just...focus on that,

01:38:23.028 --> 01:38:24.028
relax,

01:38:25.465 --> 01:38:27.418
and you'll slip right into a dream.

01:38:31.397 --> 01:38:33.037
-WHISPERS: Okay, I'll try it.

01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:34.741
-'Night, Abe.

01:38:41.424 --> 01:38:42.821
-That's what's keeping me awake.

01:38:47.955 --> 01:38:48.955
My wife.

01:38:50.588 --> 01:38:53.121
And this was...before we were married.

01:38:54.604 --> 01:38:56.071
We were great, Harold.

01:38:58.257 --> 01:38:59.942
-What happened after
you got married?

01:39:00.591 --> 01:39:01.591
-I don't know.

01:39:03.068 --> 01:39:04.169
You know what I mean?

01:39:07.274 --> 01:39:08.274
Heck,

01:39:09.688 --> 01:39:11.219
I can't remember everything, but

01:39:12.344 --> 01:39:13.842
she was making dinner one night,

01:39:14.789 --> 01:39:17.584
her signature dish, it was
chickpeas and rice and...

01:39:18.164 --> 01:39:22.242
and vegetables or something all cooked
in soy sauce and Cayenne pepper.

01:39:23.867 --> 01:39:25.334
-Sounds...interesting.

01:39:26.063 --> 01:39:27.396
-It was pretty good.

01:39:28.047 --> 01:39:29.047
I loved it.

01:39:29.766 --> 01:39:32.635
I thought it was so cute,
how she made it her own.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.649
Really the only thing
she ever cooked.

01:39:37.719 --> 01:39:39.452
So, we were cooking and...

01:39:39.672 --> 01:39:41.539
we were joking around and...

01:39:41.624 --> 01:39:42.924
she stopped for a second.

01:39:44.266 --> 01:39:47.265
She turned to me and she asked me if
I thought I was funnier than her.

01:39:47.946 --> 01:39:48.946
-Oh.
-Yeah.

01:39:49.477 --> 01:39:50.758
I mean, of course I was,

01:39:51.547 --> 01:39:53.347
so of course I told her so.

01:39:54.742 --> 01:39:56.429
Her face immediately
scrunched up.

01:39:59.133 --> 01:40:00.953
I still don't understand, though.

01:40:01.907 --> 01:40:03.054
I mean, she can be the smart,

01:40:03.805 --> 01:40:04.805
pretty one,

01:40:06.032 --> 01:40:07.359
why can't I be the funny one?

01:40:08.953 --> 01:40:10.977
-(yawning) I guess you have to pick one.

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.092
-I know I was the funny one.

01:40:15.999 --> 01:40:18.465
I guess over the course of our
relationship, her sense of humor

01:40:19.533 --> 01:40:20.533
slowly

01:40:20.986 --> 01:40:21.986
mirrored mine.

01:40:25.150 --> 01:40:26.428
That's how I know she loved me.

01:40:32.384 --> 01:40:34.348
WHISPERS: I wish I could get back to you.

01:41:39.389 --> 01:41:40.389
-Hey Abe,

01:41:41.889 --> 01:41:44.098
why are there a bunch of pictures that

01:41:45.397 --> 01:41:47.178
kind of look like me in your notebook?

01:41:48.194 --> 01:41:49.194
-It is you.

01:41:51.178 --> 01:41:52.514
But you're not dead yet.

01:41:53.014 --> 01:41:54.281
That's a good sign.

01:41:56.686 --> 01:41:57.686
-Y-yet?

01:41:58.975 --> 01:42:01.764
-I'll explain later. Can you hand
me those...those blueprints?

01:42:03.045 --> 01:42:04.512
-W-what are you doing?

01:42:04.624 --> 01:42:06.187
-Trying to figure something out.

01:42:08.444 --> 01:42:09.844
-Get down from there!

01:42:10.233 --> 01:42:13.498
-Well, if you hand me the blueprints
like I asked you to a moment ago,

01:42:13.522 --> 01:42:15.162
I can explain.
-But Abe...don't!

01:42:15.187 --> 01:42:16.303
Get down! Don't do this!

01:42:16.811 --> 01:42:19.411
Get down. It's the green one!
-Let go!

01:42:23.905 --> 01:42:25.659
Let...go!
-No!

01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:30.960
You're gonna kill me or something. There's
like 30 sketches of me dead in that book.

01:42:33.311 --> 01:42:34.311
Explain.

01:42:34.725 --> 01:42:36.125
-I need those! Get...

01:42:37.045 --> 01:42:40.312
-No! Not until you explain!
-It's complicated.

01:42:41.069 --> 01:42:43.878
-Why...are you drawing me...dead?

01:42:44.436 --> 01:42:47.569
-Those are pictures...of
when you already died.

01:42:49.209 --> 01:42:50.422
-What are you talking about?

01:42:51.155 --> 01:42:53.678
-I keep remembering things
so I draw them, or I...

01:42:54.264 --> 01:42:56.731
I draw them and then remember things,

01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:04.510
-Doesn't make any sense.

01:43:07.699 --> 01:43:08.699
Protocol

01:43:08.988 --> 01:43:10.188
states a procedure for

01:43:10.754 --> 01:43:11.964
when you go nuts.

01:43:13.736 --> 01:43:15.300
-It started with the bees.

01:43:16.205 --> 01:43:17.338
I started drawing

01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.500
them a lot...hundreds of

01:43:19.978 --> 01:43:21.426
doodles and sketches

01:43:23.088 --> 01:43:24.571
and then I started
drawing them dead.

01:43:26.377 --> 01:43:27.603
And then they actually died.

01:45:20.014 --> 01:45:21.014
-The eels?

01:45:21.818 --> 01:45:24.229
-Yeah, I don't understand
most this stuff. It's

01:45:24.483 --> 01:45:26.098
pieces that I try to put together.

01:45:28.811 --> 01:45:29.944
-But you had some

01:45:30.537 --> 01:45:32.019
vision that they killed me?

01:45:32.044 --> 01:45:34.310
-No, no...they're...they're
fragmented memories.

01:45:34.818 --> 01:45:37.126
The drawings are a
catalogue of them...I....

01:45:37.701 --> 01:45:40.380
I st...I start doodling and
don't even realize it and then I....

01:45:40.404 --> 01:45:43.142
I look at a sketch and I'm
trying to remember something...

01:45:44.662 --> 01:45:45.788
-So what will you see next?

01:45:46.428 --> 01:45:48.961
-It's...it's not like that. I don't...

01:45:48.985 --> 01:45:50.708
I don't know, I remember.

01:45:52.676 --> 01:45:53.876
This all happened,

01:45:54.317 --> 01:45:55.317
will happen,

01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:56.520
<i>is</i> happening,

01:45:58.136 --> 01:46:00.172
I'm not sure it's only
happening to us, either.

01:46:00.196 --> 01:46:03.154
<i>-I'm not sure it's only
happening to us, either.</i>

01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:04.480
-So...

01:46:05.402 --> 01:46:06.711
he was going to kill me.

01:46:14.259 --> 01:46:15.395
Harold, wait!

01:46:21.266 --> 01:46:23.817
-This is...this is right, Abe?

01:46:25.164 --> 01:46:26.164
-I don't know.

01:46:26.937 --> 01:46:28.204
It's not a science.

01:46:29.969 --> 01:46:31.302
-You're a scientist.

01:46:33.125 --> 01:46:34.666
What kind of scientist are you?

01:46:35.117 --> 01:46:36.450
-Marine biology, but

01:46:37.187 --> 01:46:38.866
I don't...I don't know if I'm right.

01:46:41.156 --> 01:46:43.089
-So you were gonna cut wires?

01:46:44.226 --> 01:46:45.226
On a hunch?

01:46:49.843 --> 01:46:53.140
Maybe some water gets out
of the tank and I...I slip.

01:46:53.374 --> 01:46:54.374
I don't know.

01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:56.194
Maybe you don't die.

01:46:59.359 --> 01:47:00.694
Maybe that's what changes.

01:47:01.778 --> 01:47:03.059
If you...if you flip past

01:47:03.942 --> 01:47:05.077
the path I started...

01:47:05.794 --> 01:47:07.327
drawing all of these...

01:47:09.411 --> 01:47:10.411
white cracks...

01:47:11.013 --> 01:47:12.013
against black.

01:47:12.037 --> 01:47:13.590
-Like the ground.
-I have no idea.

01:47:13.615 --> 01:47:14.887
-Yes. In...in the water.

01:47:14.912 --> 01:47:17.690
-...what that could mean, but
then a couple of days ago,

01:47:18.419 --> 01:47:19.419
I drew this hat...

01:47:20.739 --> 01:47:22.400
-How did I fall into the tank?

01:47:22.645 --> 01:47:23.645
-I have...

01:47:24.067 --> 01:47:25.331
I have no idea what it means.

01:47:26.825 --> 01:47:28.558
-If I put my hand in here,

01:47:29.364 --> 01:47:31.668
-And you think it's enough
to kill a man?

01:47:31.692 --> 01:47:34.061
Huh? Stop!
-is that how I die?

01:47:34.084 --> 01:47:36.084
Come on! Do you remember anything?
Come on!

01:47:36.458 --> 01:47:37.458
I'm not dying.

01:47:37.762 --> 01:47:38.762
(screams)

01:47:47.562 --> 01:47:48.562
-Damn.

01:48:27.188 --> 01:48:28.321
What's out there?

01:49:10.258 --> 01:49:11.954
Damn it, Harold!

01:51:09.721 --> 01:51:10.721
What?

01:52:03.931 --> 01:52:05.019
I think I've seen this one.

01:52:24.972 --> 01:52:26.048
You were gone a while.

01:52:26.418 --> 01:52:27.866
-I stopped at this flea market.

01:52:29.074 --> 01:52:30.207
-I like your hat.

01:52:30.597 --> 01:52:32.291
-Oh, I got it for you.

01:52:34.004 --> 01:52:35.004
-Oh, it's way too small.

01:52:35.730 --> 01:52:37.463
-No, it looks cute on you.

01:52:37.488 --> 01:52:40.648
-Babe...it just rests on my head.

01:52:43.512 --> 01:52:44.777
It fits you pretty well.

01:52:46.199 --> 01:52:48.385
You look pretty good with it on, too.

01:52:48.574 --> 01:52:49.707
-Well, thank you.

01:52:57.844 --> 01:52:59.044
-I'll go get that.

01:53:00.594 --> 01:53:01.994
I'll be back to help.

01:53:17.397 --> 01:53:18.350
-Hello?

01:53:18.375 --> 01:53:20.086
-The green.

01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.600
eel.
-I'm...

01:53:21.936 --> 01:53:22.936
I'm sorry?
-The...

01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:24.397
green...eel.

01:53:25.879 --> 01:53:27.026
That's unfortunate.

01:53:27.089 --> 01:53:28.516
Nurse Walters...That failed.

01:53:28.988 --> 01:53:31.053
Dr. Withersford?
-How are you doing?

01:53:31.207 --> 01:53:32.207
-I'm...okay.

01:53:33.644 --> 01:53:35.700
Listen, I have to...
-Dr. Anderson,

01:53:35.863 --> 01:53:40.399
I regret to inform you that the position
you volunteered for has been filled.

01:53:40.527 --> 01:53:43.061
My sincere condolences.

01:53:43.355 --> 01:53:44.355
-Huh...

01:53:46.214 --> 01:53:47.432
well, thanks...for the call.

01:54:58.839 --> 01:54:59.839
-Get down!

01:55:00.878 --> 01:55:02.112
Stop....

01:55:03.034 --> 01:55:04.542
-Fucking .

01:55:07.862 --> 01:55:09.216
-You remember which one to cut?

01:55:14.134 --> 01:55:15.438
-I think it's the red one.

01:55:16.462 --> 01:55:18.329
-What does it do?
-I can...

01:55:19.298 --> 01:55:21.775
I can't remember for the life of me.
-Well how about for mine?.

01:55:26.181 --> 01:55:28.107
-Red. It's red.

01:55:39.939 --> 01:55:41.337
-I knew it was the green one.
