00:00.039 --> 00:01.153
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.</i>

00:01.224 --> 00:02.889
<i>Here are a few things
that you might need to know.</i>

00:04.126 --> 00:05.749
Jill.
<i>Hey.</i>

00:05.795 --> 00:06.870
I can help you.

00:06.925 --> 00:07.563
<i>Come on!</i>

00:08.517 --> 00:09.317
You're under arrest, Jill.

00:09.381 --> 00:10.651
And I'm breaking up
with you.

00:10.712 --> 00:11.515
Dad's gone.

00:11.563 --> 00:13.275
I thought I needed him
to walk me down the aisle.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.707
I thought that
he would be different.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.623
From that guy
that walked out on us.

00:16.688 --> 00:17.480
<i>Morning, Charles.</i>

00:17.550 --> 00:18.872
I'm not
who you think I am.

00:18.933 --> 00:19.994
You're Orion.

00:19.995 --> 00:21.728
I'll give FULCRUM
their Intersect.

00:21.788 --> 00:23.510
But my son walks away
from here.

00:23.702 --> 00:24.810
Take care of yourself.

00:25.660 --> 00:28.157
<i>As soon as my dad
finishes the new Intersect,</i>

00:28.208 --> 00:30.162
<i>I'm worthless to you.
And FULCRUM wins.</i>

00:30.163 --> 00:31.453
The only thing
that matters now

00:31.523 --> 00:32.852
is getting my father back.

Froyo.

00:44.621 --> 00:47.039
It's time to try
our latest flavour.

00:47.106 --> 00:48.196
Obama Guava.

00:48.645 --> 00:51.663
- I didn't make up the name--
- Ah, no thanks.

00:51.725 --> 00:53.445
Not that I'm not thrilled
that the CIA

00:53.500 --> 00:55.095
has found
a new yoghurt recipe,

00:55.164 --> 00:56.346
I was just--
I don't know.

00:56.346 --> 00:58.601
Kind of hoping the CIA
would find my father first.

00:58.632 --> 01:00.094
The government
is doing everything

01:00.145 --> 01:01.453
they can to find him.

01:01.688 --> 01:03.098
How do I know
I can trust them?

01:03.544 --> 01:06.042
The government wants to keep
the Intersect in my head.

01:06.063 --> 01:08.230
My father's the only person
who can get it out.

01:08.265 --> 01:09.370
It's not rocket science.

01:09.416 --> 01:11.502
Okay, I know that
you don't trust them.

01:11.503 --> 01:12.603
But do you trust me?

01:16.534 --> 01:17.357
Yeah.

01:17.592 --> 01:18.313
Good.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.685
But I promise you
we're gonna find him.

01:20.753 --> 01:22.003
No, hurry.
Please.

01:22.771 --> 01:23.867
<i>What's the matter,
Chuck?</i>

01:24.236 --> 01:25.726
Your dad's
back in town, right?

01:25.767 --> 01:28.062
You're dating the
hottest slice of a BBQ pizza.

01:28.170 --> 01:29.981
And you are best friends
with me.

01:30.846 --> 01:32.614
Which means,
two out of three ins of bad, right?

01:32.675 --> 01:34.019
Come on,
you're king of the world, dude.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.656
Bartowski!
Get it together.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.905
Yeah.
King of the world.

01:37.981 --> 01:40.516
Emmett's got an announcement.
So listen up.

01:41.132 --> 01:42.190
Aye, aye, captain.

01:44.433 --> 01:45.500
<i>Alright, now.</i>

01:46.029 --> 01:48.259
Sometime over
the next 24 hours,

01:48.532 --> 01:50.765
a Buy More corporate evaluator
will be here

01:50.808 --> 01:52.683
to evaluate,
a yours truly.

01:53.798 --> 01:55.147
Now normally,
in this situation,

01:55.184 --> 01:56.353
I would expect a certain...

01:56.896 --> 01:57.672
<i>tride.</i>

01:57.707 --> 01:59.902
<i>To use this opportunity
to make me look bad.</i>

02:01.370 --> 02:03.721
Ha ha ha!
Laugh it up, Kreatons.

02:04.097 --> 02:04.904
<i>The tech jobs are</i>

02:04.971 --> 02:07.305
being shipped to India
faster than you can say,

02:07.334 --> 02:09.330
"Would you like fries
and a soft drink with that?"

02:09.330 --> 02:10.668
<i>I can't work fast-food,
Emmett.</i>

02:11.338 --> 02:12.143
I keep kosher.

02:12.214 --> 02:13.588
Count me on
the trip to India.

02:13.852 --> 02:16.251
I've always dreamt to see
Lester in his native environment.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.857
- What?
- You test me...

02:18.203 --> 02:19.665
and you'll be flipping burgers

02:20.210 --> 02:21.533
<i>for the rest
of your miserable life.</i>

02:22.118 --> 02:22.785
<i>Now.</i>

02:22.887 --> 02:24.473
Let's show corporate...

02:24.590 --> 02:27.944
that we're lean, mean,
Buy More Machine.

02:28.403 --> 02:30.379
- So comb your hair.
- Jealous?

02:32.602 --> 02:33.966
Lower that whore skirt.

02:34.062 --> 02:35.014
Excuse me?

02:35.164 --> 02:36.907
And for God's sake,
Barnes,

02:37.235 --> 02:39.381
I'm tired of seeing
your butt crack.

02:39.619 --> 02:40.576
Pull it up!

02:43.912 --> 02:45.242
Well, that went well.

02:45.569 --> 02:47.429
Hey.
Update from Beckman.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.852
Well. Is it information of
where my father is?

02:50.063 --> 02:51.238
We're about to
find out.

02:55.689 --> 02:56.294
<i>I mean, people,</i>

02:56.340 --> 02:57.668
do you have any idea
what working with

02:57.702 --> 02:59.245
fried food would
do to my complexion?

02:59.689 --> 03:00.830
Can't leave the Buy More.

03:00.855 --> 03:02.491
I won't survive
in the real world.

03:03.054 --> 03:04.227
I miss the tush
and all.

03:04.294 --> 03:06.941
Morgan, we're the brains
of this operation

03:07.008 --> 03:08.345
<i>so let's you and I
come up with something.</i>

03:09.063 --> 03:09.908
Why don't you
start us off?

03:09.983 --> 03:11.473
Well, as I see it...

03:11.531 --> 03:14.989
Emmett's threat was a rouse
to get us to work hard.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.083
So he would look good
in front of corporate.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.380
But think about this...

03:17.467 --> 03:19.401
<i>Emmett asked us to behave
because he knows</i>

03:19.479 --> 03:20.789
<i>we would do
the exact opposite.</i>

03:20.920 --> 03:21.832
We'd misbehave.

03:21.908 --> 03:24.209
But Emmett...
He's no fool.

03:24.276 --> 03:25.787
So he would know that
we would know that

03:25.838 --> 03:26.451
he knows this.

03:27.277 --> 03:29.110
So obviously,
we need to behave.

03:29.176 --> 03:29.814
<i>Okay.</i>

03:29.864 --> 03:31.010
So we behave.

03:31.068 --> 03:33.478
Pay attention.
<i>It's the exact opposite.</i>

03:33.700 --> 03:35.157
Emmett would also know

03:35.192 --> 03:36.988
that we'd know
that he knows we know,

03:37.000 --> 03:38.754
<i>because he knows
that we know</i>

03:38.789 --> 03:40.066
<i>that what he knows...</i>

03:40.264 --> 03:42.753
is that we know
he wants us to behave.

03:43.800 --> 03:44.666
Right!

03:45.000 --> 03:46.021
Yes!

03:46.600 --> 03:48.006
Yes.
I don't know how we do it,

03:48.036 --> 03:49.702
but we are geniuses,
my friend.

03:49.900 --> 03:50.500
Thank you.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.357
<i>So, what are we
doing again?</i>

03:52.600 --> 03:54.100
God, I love technology.

03:54.700 --> 03:55.799
What we are doing again

03:56.100 --> 03:58.721
<i>is we're going to let
Rome burn.</i>

04:01.300 --> 04:02.600
<i>We've used
every resource</i>

04:02.600 --> 04:04.100
<i>to find him
with no luck.</i>

04:04.100 --> 04:05.123
<i>I'm sorry, Chuck.</i>

04:05.500 --> 04:08.181
<i>FULCRUM's kept a tight lid
on your father's whereabouts.</i>

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
That's your update?

04:10.700 --> 04:12.200
Well, I'm sorry,
but that's a non-update.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.567
And you know what?
It's not good enough.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.700
Watch it, Bartowski.
It's a U.S.

04:14.700 --> 04:15.888
<i>general you're talking to.</i>

04:15.900 --> 04:17.553
I've spent
the last year of my life

04:17.553 --> 04:20.333
being tortured,
dangled off of skyscrapers,

04:20.375 --> 04:21.899
bathed in sewage.

04:21.899 --> 04:23.000
<i>Stop me
if I've forgotten</i>

04:23.000 --> 04:24.937
<i>any other glamorous perks
of this job.</i>

04:25.200 --> 04:26.600
I've continually done
everything

04:26.600 --> 04:27.605
that you guys
have asked me to do,

04:27.640 --> 04:29.091
but once
my dad gets kidnapped,

04:29.200 --> 04:30.708
all you can say is sorry?

04:30.900 --> 04:33.100
<i>Chuck, I understand
your disappointment.</i>

04:33.100 --> 04:33.690
Do you?

04:34.147 --> 04:35.401
<i>Then why haven't
we found him yet?</i>

04:35.700 --> 04:36.982
We've captured
FULCRUM agents before.

04:37.028 --> 04:37.819
Can't we talk to them?

04:37.854 --> 04:40.100
<i>Yeah, we tried that,
but since the new administration</i>

04:40.100 --> 04:43.441
discontinued water-boarding,
FULCRUM agents don't talk.

04:43.476 --> 04:45.638
And even if we did,
we have no reason to trust them.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.600
I'm willing to do
whatever it takes

04:47.800 --> 04:49.151
by any means necessary.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.183
So what if I could get
a FULCRUM agent to talk?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.228
<i>You're 100% sure</i>

04:58.265 --> 04:59.309
<i>you want to go
through with this?</i>

05:00.600 --> 05:01.700
<i>More like 45.</i>

05:02.800 --> 05:04.200
<i>Maybe...
Maybe 30.</i>

05:06.600 --> 05:07.754
<i>But I guess
I don't really have</i>

05:07.754 --> 05:09.147
<i>any other choice now,
do I?</i>

05:26.600 --> 05:27.455

06:08.900 --> 06:09.948
So, how's the food?

06:11.000 --> 06:11.912
Standard prison issue,

06:11.951 --> 06:13.100
or are they doing
anything fancy

06:13.100 --> 06:14.200
with the sauces?

06:17.700 --> 06:18.926
What are you doing here,
Chuck?

06:21.100 --> 06:22.605
FULCRUM has
kidnapped my father.

06:23.900 --> 06:26.391
They're using him
to rebuild their Intersect,

06:27.100 --> 06:28.043
and when he's done...

06:30.800 --> 06:31.900
Look, I don't even want
to think

06:31.900 --> 06:33.444
about what's gonna happen
when that happens.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.377
Let me guess.

06:36.000 --> 06:36.895
You want my help?

06:38.200 --> 06:38.953
Forget it.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
I get that
you're mad at me,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.500
but it's not my fault
you're in here.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.132
<i>You betrayed your country.</i>

06:45.400 --> 06:46.300
Who betrayed me.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.439
I thought
you cared about me.

06:49.467 --> 06:50.394
But now...

06:50.500 --> 06:52.498
All I'm asking is for
my family back, please.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.119
I might be able to help.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.387
But I want a deal.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.200
<i>Uh...</i>

06:59.444 --> 07:01.565
<i>Do not make a deal.
Do not make a deal!</i>

07:01.600 --> 07:03.300
I'm-I'm not...
I'm not really authorized

07:03.300 --> 07:04.397
to make any kind of deal.

07:05.400 --> 07:05.993
But in this case,

07:06.060 --> 07:07.400
I think
I can make an exception.

07:16.531 --> 07:20.310
[ # Twisted Sister:
We're Not Gonna Take It # ]

07:28.100 --> 07:30.100
Do I work here?
No, no.

07:30.100 --> 07:32.300
I just wear this
ridiculous outfit

07:32.300 --> 07:34.566
so that people like you
will ask me if I do.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.168
Emmett asked me
to give this to you.

07:42.200 --> 07:42.941
Oh.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.068
Mighty fine cart work.

07:52.500 --> 07:53.200
Emmett?

07:59.400 --> 08:00.200
Hello?

08:03.800 --> 08:05.498
Got this...
Got this note.

Milbarge.

08:12.700 --> 08:13.376
Grimes.

08:13.800 --> 08:14.822
Let me cut to the chase.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.623
I despise you.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.601
But these losers listen to you
for some reason,

08:18.652 --> 08:19.281
so I need you.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.097
Talk to me.

08:20.199 --> 08:22.500
I was brought here to
make this store efficient.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.800
If corporate sees that,
they will have no recourse

08:24.800 --> 08:26.100
but to do
the efficient thing

08:26.100 --> 08:28.033
and promote me
out of this hellhole.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.000
Get your little
merry band of misfits

08:31.000 --> 08:34.490
to behave, and I'll be out
of your dirty beard forever.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.568
How do I know
that I can...

08:38.840 --> 08:39.990
trust you?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.600
You don't,
but I want out,

08:43.100 --> 08:46.000
and you want me out,
so let's...

08:47.600 --> 08:48.954
make a deal.

08:51.300 --> 08:53.172
I can't believe
we made this deal.

08:54.600 --> 08:55.102
If you run

08:55.162 --> 08:56.144
<i>or double-cross us,</i>

08:56.700 --> 08:58.900
your deal is void.
Plus, as an added bonus,

08:58.900 --> 09:00.141
she'll shoot you.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.968
Chuck's dad--
Where is he?

09:03.100 --> 09:04.663
I don't know exactly,

09:04.698 --> 09:05.600
but I do know someone

09:05.600 --> 09:07.156
who might know
where they're holding him.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.681
- Who?
- My Uncle Bernie.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.100
<i>That better not
be a joke,</i>

09:10.100 --> 09:11.000
'cause I don't have
a sense of humor.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.300
Yeah, I don't remember
you ever mentioning

09:12.300 --> 09:13.900
an Uncle Bernie to me
when we were dating.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.100
He's not a real uncle.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.500
He's a friend of the family.

09:17.000 --> 09:17.703
<i>He's the one who first</i>

09:17.759 --> 09:18.742
recruited me into FULCRUM.

09:18.800 --> 09:19.927
And how do we know
we can trust him?

09:20.100 --> 09:21.385
He's my dad's best friend.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.200
<i>If there's one person
I can trust, it's him.</i>

09:24.700 --> 09:25.519
Where's Bernie?

09:26.000 --> 09:26.700
<i>We'll flush him out,</i>

09:26.700 --> 09:27.800
torture the location
out of him.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.700
He's guarded
almost 24 hours a day.

09:29.700 --> 09:30.980
What does almost mean?

09:31.100 --> 09:32.809
Yeah, when is Bernie away
from his bodyguards?

09:33.300 --> 09:34.975
Usually only for
family functions.

09:35.000 --> 09:35.943
Are there any coming up?

09:36.300 --> 09:37.605
Birthdays,
confirmations...

09:37.744 --> 09:38.569
Quiceaneras?

09:40.600 --> 09:41.479
Well, then,

09:42.300 --> 09:44.184
I guess we're going to have to
create one on our own.

09:46.300 --> 09:47.181
I'm engaged.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.845
It's Tacori.
It's beautiful.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.311
Oh, well,
thanks, Judy.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.865
No, call me Mom.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.600
Most girls only get
four C's with a ring,

09:55.600 --> 09:57.479
but, uh, my Jill--
She got five.

09:57.900 --> 10:00.000
<i>Cut, color, clarity, carat,
and Chuck.</i>

10:00.000 --> 10:01.435
<i>Isn't this gorgeous?</i>

10:02.200 --> 10:03.367
That ring
cost the taxpayers

10:03.418 --> 10:04.700
a fortune, Bartowski.

10:04.700 --> 10:05.400
<i>Don't lose it.</i>

10:06.000 --> 10:06.800
Here they are.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.892
Mr. and Mrs. Bartowski.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.180
So, Jill, this is such
a wonderful surprise.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.300
We thought she was
living in Helsinki. We...

10:21.300 --> 10:22.900
We didn't know
when we'd see her again.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.900
Well, Chuck popped
the question,

10:24.900 --> 10:26.737
and I wanted to share it
with everybody.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.300
Well, Wally,

10:28.300 --> 10:29.700
I think this calls for a toast.

10:29.700 --> 10:30.400
<i>No, no, no, Dad.</i>

10:30.400 --> 10:31.893
You don't...
You don't have to do that.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.600
Listen, I have waited
all my life

10:35.000 --> 10:37.100
for my little girl
to get married...

10:37.200 --> 10:38.379
You bet I do.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.700
I remember when you
first met at Stanford,

10:44.700 --> 10:46.000
<i>the way you'd look
at each other...</i>

10:46.400 --> 10:47.952
<i>Just like your mom
and I did.</i>

10:48.200 --> 10:50.500
And I know
you've had your problems,

10:51.100 --> 10:53.600
but deep inside,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.100
<i>you knew you were right
for each other.</i>

10:57.100 --> 10:58.375
And you never let
anything

10:58.375 --> 10:59.295
get in the way of that.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.210
To Jill...
and Chuck.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.900
To Jill and Chuck!

11:05.700 --> 11:07.000
Congratulations, Bartowski.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.624
You're now qualified
for conjugal visits.

11:10.700 --> 11:11.568
<i>There's a car approaching.</i>

11:11.568 --> 11:12.267
<i>This could be him.</i>

11:13.400 --> 11:15.087
<i>Bartowski,
this guy's a madman.</i>

11:15.122 --> 11:16.600
<i>His codename's
"The Carnivore."</i>

11:17.100 --> 11:18.400
<i>Seems he's got a real appetite</i>

11:18.400 --> 11:19.400
<i>for blood.</i>

11:20.000 --> 11:20.759
<i>Great.</i>

11:27.900 --> 11:28.814
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.322
Bernie,
how are you?!

11:30.357 --> 11:31.500
Great, Wally.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.600
So, what is this
big surprise

11:33.600 --> 11:34.900
you couldn't tell me
over the phone?

11:35.200 --> 11:36.100
Jill's engaged!

11:37.200 --> 11:38.202
Jill's here?

11:39.300 --> 11:39.700
Where?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.615
<i>You are so adorable,
Chuck.</i>

11:42.100 --> 11:43.040
You two are
gonna have the most

11:43.040 --> 11:44.068
beautiful babies.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.555
I want a girl and a boy.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.800
I'm sorry, Chuck, is all
this talk of children

11:57.800 --> 11:58.379
<i>scaring you?</i>

11:59.800 --> 12:01.123
No, no, no, no.

12:01.156 --> 12:02.660
I love kids,
really, yeah.

12:02.700 --> 12:03.500
Jill!

12:04.400 --> 12:06.200
I thought
you moved to Helsinki.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.900
<i>You're not
the only one, Bernie.</i>

12:07.900 --> 12:09.564
You really need to
come home more often.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.500
Yeah, I-I really get to
see her myself.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.700
She works so much,
she might as well be in prison.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.100
Oh, so you're
the lucky guy, huh?

12:18.200 --> 12:19.600
Oh, hey! Hey!

12:19.800 --> 12:21.297
It's Chuck.
Nice to meet you, Bernie.

12:21.332 --> 12:22.200
No, no, no.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.174
You call me
Uncle Bernie.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.000
We're family now.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.800
<i>We were just telling them
that the key</i>

12:27.800 --> 12:29.523
to a good marriage
is trust.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.750
<i>Your spouse
must be the only person</i>

12:32.751 --> 12:34.258
<i>you always rely on...</i>

12:34.600 --> 12:35.754
Who'll never betray you.

12:35.789 --> 12:39.065
Uh, you mind if I, uh,
borrow the happy couple?

12:39.200 --> 12:41.049
<i>I got a few words of
wisdom myself.</i>

12:41.900 --> 12:42.600
Okay.

12:45.800 --> 12:46.523
Good luck!

12:47.600 --> 12:49.700
Bernie didn't like
Jill's last boyfriend and...

12:50.000 --> 12:51.389
that's the last
we saw of him.

12:51.390 --> 12:53.041
Oh, is that so?

13:01.100 --> 13:02.065
What are you doing here, Jill?

13:02.400 --> 13:03.400
I thought
you were in jail.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.000
I made a deal
with the CIA.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.520
What?
What kind of a deal?

13:06.600 --> 13:07.800
<i>Look, Bernie,
all you have to do is</i>

13:07.800 --> 13:09.300
tell us where FULCRUM
is hiding my father

13:09.300 --> 13:11.207
and we can offer you
witness protection, too.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.885
Oh, you stupid little...

13:16.000 --> 13:16.573
Are you wired?

13:16.629 --> 13:18.000
- No, we're not.
- Are you wired?!

13:18.000 --> 13:19.100
Yes, yes, we are.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.700
- They're gone.
- Let's go.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.553
No, we can't just blast in
and blow Chuck's cover.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.394
Oh, my.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.967
Look how happy
my baby is.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.200
<i>I'm sorry to interrupt,
I just wanted to tell you that</i>

13:33.200 --> 13:34.172
dinner's almost ready,
okay?

13:34.600 --> 13:35.580
Thanks, Judy.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.663
Don't torture them
too much, Bernie.

13:41.900 --> 13:42.446
<i>Jill!</i>

13:45.000 --> 13:46.100
Come on,
come on, come on!

13:49.600 --> 13:50.578
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.265
And you are?

13:52.400 --> 13:54.043
I'm Chuck's cousin, Sarah.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.181
And this is
my boyfriend, John.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.400
Talk about
Beauty and the Beast, huh?

13:58.400 --> 13:59.500
You must be loaded!

14:02.109 --> 14:02.929
Oh, oh.

14:02.979 --> 14:04.100
Just a
little friendly ribbing.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.287
We're family now!

14:05.500 --> 14:06.377
Yeah, family.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.200
- This is my lovely wife, Judy.
- Hello.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.500
- <i>Pleased to meet you.</i>
- Pleased to meet you.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.500
Yeah, so,
where's the lucky couple, hmm?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.544
They're having a sit down with,
uh, Uncle Bernie.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.503
And if I know him,
Chuck is dead meat by now.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.075
Casey, Sarah, third floor!

14:19.075 --> 14:19.896
<i>We're in trouble!</i>

14:20.000 --> 14:21.900
<i>I don't know if he wants to
kill me or eat me!</i>

14:21.900 --> 14:23.579
Is the bathroom upstairs,
I hope?

14:23.700 --> 14:24.700
- Excuse me.
- Oh, uh...

14:24.700 --> 14:26.578
I have to go...
We had a very long drive.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.608
- Where are we going?
- The attic.

14:34.000 --> 14:34.826
The only way out is up.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Um, hey,
Casey and Sarah,

14:39.000 --> 14:39.938
<i>we're in the attic,
we need some help-</i>

14:39.942 --> 14:40.546
A lot of help!

14:41.000 --> 14:41.776
Window!

14:42.600 --> 14:43.192
Jill!

14:45.100 --> 14:46.600
Bernie,
please don't do this.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.500
You can't shoot us

14:48.000 --> 14:49.611
because the whole family
will hear it.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.400
<i>You're right;</i>
I can't.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.910
But I can beat you
to death.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.200
I was really hoping
for a third option

14:57.200 --> 14:58.303
that did not include death.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.882
- Chuck, are you okay?
- Yeah.

15:18.900 --> 15:19.900
Congratulations,
Bartowski.

15:19.900 --> 15:21.159
It's your first confirmed kill.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.600
Kill? No!

15:22.600 --> 15:23.500
No, no, no, no.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.000
I didn't kill anybody,
okay?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.200
He just died;
it was an accident.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.800
Well, maybe he had a
heart attack.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.800
What do you call
your move, anyway?

15:30.300 --> 15:30.900
What move?

15:31.600 --> 15:32.759
The girlie pose
I saw you in.

15:32.800 --> 15:33.476
What do you call that?

15:33.859 --> 15:34.517
The Morgan.

15:35.000 --> 15:35.900
The Morgan?

15:35.900 --> 15:37.100
He invented it
in high school

15:37.100 --> 15:38.400
<i>when girls were
beating him up.</i>

15:38.400 --> 15:39.600
You kind of
duck a little bit,

15:39.900 --> 15:41.400
protect the important...

15:41.400 --> 15:42.700
You know,
your face and your...

15:43.100 --> 15:43.900
What are we gonna do?!

15:44.500 --> 15:46.100
We were telling him
about our wedding plans,

15:46.600 --> 15:48.300
and he just kept
knocking back scotches

15:48.300 --> 15:49.847
until the next thing
we knew,

15:49.902 --> 15:51.026
<i>he was dead drunk.</i>

15:51.600 --> 15:52.839
Uh, call me, Bernie!

15:53.000 --> 15:53.971
Yeah, get some rest!

15:54.200 --> 15:54.960
Okay.

15:55.100 --> 15:56.613
Yeah, we should
get him home.

15:56.652 --> 15:57.127
Okay.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.000
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, sweetheart.

16:04.300 --> 16:05.418
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, sweetie.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.964
<i>I love you.
Take care of yourself.</i>

16:11.600 --> 16:12.600
Good-bye, everyone!

16:12.600 --> 16:14.134
- Congratulations!
- See ya!

16:15.300 --> 16:16.100
Thanks!

16:16.100 --> 16:17.300
We'll take care of Bernie.

16:18.800 --> 16:19.900
<i>Way to go, killer.</i>

16:20.100 --> 16:21.000
You just offed
the only person

16:21.000 --> 16:22.200
who knows
where your dad is.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.806
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

16:35.100 --> 16:36.000
Wow, Morgan.

16:36.000 --> 16:36.648
<i>They look great.</i>

16:37.200 --> 16:40.030
I may look good,
but I feel like an idiot.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.000
Anybody sees or hears
about this,

16:42.400 --> 16:43.764
my rep is ruined.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.700
Can you relax?
Relax and trust me, please.

16:45.700 --> 16:46.300
This is the only way

16:46.300 --> 16:47.894
we're gonna get Emmett
out of our hair.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.154
No pain, no gain,
remember?

16:49.200 --> 16:51.374
<i>As you can see,
we're running smoother</i>

16:51.409 --> 16:53.100
than a
Swiss watch.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.780
You'll find no finer example of
Buy More employees in the land.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.800
Mr. Patel here is one of our
certified computer technicians.

17:00.800 --> 17:01.621
Very pleased...

17:01.873 --> 17:02.700
<i>to meet you, sir.</i>

17:02.700 --> 17:05.900
And may I just say,
I would do pretty much

17:05.900 --> 17:06.900
anything for this man.

17:06.900 --> 17:07.559
He is...

17:09.599 --> 17:12.000
somewhat of a hero
around here.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.085
A constant brownnoser.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.800
Well, he was born brown.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.500
May I go a step further
and say that, uh, to me,

17:18.500 --> 17:20.183
Emmett is the straw

17:20.800 --> 17:23.300
that gently stirs
the Buy More drink.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.792
I can't tell you
how many times

17:24.829 --> 17:26.900
<i>I defiled myself at work.</i>

17:27.700 --> 17:29.000
<i>Emmett cured me of that.</i>

17:29.000 --> 17:32.518
Now I only violate myself
at home or in the car.

17:33.300 --> 17:35.400
But never in the Nerd Herder.

17:35.400 --> 17:39.200
He has made such progress
under Mr. Milbarge's...

17:41.000 --> 17:41.900
Tutelage.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.230
We're all so proud.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.264
I'm your captain.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.822
Yes, captain, my captain.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.300
Let me show you around.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.100
<i>You better be right
about this, Morgan.</i>

17:53.000 --> 17:54.667
Yes, General,
I understand.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.200
Sarah, what's happening?

17:57.200 --> 17:58.275
We're moving Jill
back to prison.

17:58.900 --> 18:00.200
What?
No, we can't...

18:00.200 --> 18:01.030
We can't send her back.

18:01.065 --> 18:02.000
We haven't found
my father yet.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.564
She still might know something
and we had a deal.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.500
Chuck, I'm sorry
but the mission was a bust

18:05.500 --> 18:07.000
and Jill only put us
in more danger.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.543
That wasn't her fault!
It was Bernie!

18:08.578 --> 18:09.100
He manipulated

18:09.100 --> 18:10.600
- and betrayed her!
- You know Jill.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.100
She's a FULCRUM agent.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.300
Exactly!
That's exactly why we need her.

18:14.300 --> 18:16.547
She knows FULCRUM;
their procedures and secrets.

18:19.100 --> 18:19.900
Look, I know
she tried to kill you,

18:19.901 --> 18:21.062
and I'm sorry
about that,

18:21.082 --> 18:22.600
but she is the
best chance I have

18:22.600 --> 18:24.300
at rescuing my father.
He's out there somewhere

18:24.300 --> 18:25.761
and God only knows
what's happening to him.

18:25.900 --> 18:26.800
Chuck, you have to realize

18:26.800 --> 18:28.967
that there are some people
that you just cannot trust.

18:29.800 --> 18:30.300
Sarah...

18:32.000 --> 18:32.978
I already know that.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.012
I don't trust anyone.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.112
Except for you.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.577
And right now,
I need you to trust me.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.922
Jill is the only way
I'm gonna get my dad back.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.005
Chuck,
the answer is no.

19:00.300 --> 19:00.900
Hey, buddy.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.600
Chuck,
where you been, man?

19:02.600 --> 19:03.500
I've been calling you all day.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.100
I'm sorry, buddy,

19:04.100 --> 19:06.200
I've-I've just been
a little a little busy, that's all.

19:06.200 --> 19:06.839
<i>All right, well, listen.</i>

19:06.875 --> 19:08.600
We have a situation here
at the Buy More

19:08.600 --> 19:10.300
and I could
really use your help.

19:10.900 --> 19:11.700
I'm on an install.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.300
I- I can't help you
right now.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.434
Okay, well, just bear with me
for one second here, okay?

19:15.600 --> 19:16.500
What do you do
when the person

19:16.500 --> 19:18.000
that you think
you can trust the least

19:18.000 --> 19:19.700
<i>can actually get you the thing
you want the most?</i>

19:25.800 --> 19:26.600
You know what, Morgan?

19:28.200 --> 19:29.938
Sometimes you just need
to trust a person.

19:31.700 --> 19:32.697
Do whatever it takes.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.200
<i>Yeah,
that's what I thought.</i>

19:34.200 --> 19:34.800
Roger that.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.600
Thanks, buddy.

19:50.600 --> 19:51.500
I'm sorry.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.762
They're sending you
back to prison.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.500
Well, it's not your fault.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.020
At least I got to see
my family one last time.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.479
I'm sorry
I couldn't help you, Chuck.

20:12.200 --> 20:12.924
It's okay.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.800
I'm sorry about your
Uncle Bernie.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.481
I had no idea
The Morgan was so lethal.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.619
I'm glad you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.770
They changed me.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.764
Promise me that
you won't let them change you.

20:31.800 --> 20:32.882
I'll do my best.

20:35.800 --> 20:36.900
I liked wearing this.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.244
Even if it was
just for a few hours.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.300
They were never
gonna let me go,

20:59.700 --> 21:01.700
even if we found your dad,
would they?

21:03.300 --> 21:05.800
NSA, FULCRUM, CIA--
They're all the same.

21:05.800 --> 21:06.551
They all lie.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.590
They're not gonna
let you go either, Chuck.

21:11.300 --> 21:12.108
Watch your back.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.041
Skip, I can tell you got
a bright future ahead of you.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.178
It's a pleasure
meeting you.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.296
<i>It's all
because of Emmett.</i>

21:26.400 --> 21:26.932
Well?

21:27.100 --> 21:27.963
When are you
out of here?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.400
We've done everything
that you asked.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.106
Not everything.

21:30.624 --> 21:31.900
The hoi polloi

21:31.900 --> 21:35.000
have bowed to me,
but now the king

21:35.000 --> 21:36.075
must kiss my ring.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.368
Oh, come on.

21:38.800 --> 21:39.778
Man, why don't you
just have

21:39.819 --> 21:41.500
Mr. Mercer speak
to Big Mike directly?

21:41.500 --> 21:43.000
Because Big Mike needs me.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.900
He'll never say
kind words about me,

21:44.900 --> 21:47.200
because if I were to leave,
he has to work,

21:47.200 --> 21:48.500
and then he has to
start expending

21:48.500 --> 21:50.099
all of his energy
on the store.

21:52.100 --> 21:53.766
Rather than expending it
on your mother.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.207
Okay, okay,
hold on a second.

21:59.238 --> 22:00.700
- Yes?
- What-what, uh...

22:00.700 --> 22:01.700
What do you
want me to do?

22:01.700 --> 22:02.583
Ah!

22:03.300 --> 22:04.724
Use this,
and get him to say

22:04.776 --> 22:05.757
nice words about me.

22:06.100 --> 22:08.000
When Mr. Mercer
hears Michael rave,

22:08.000 --> 22:11.147
he will finally release me
from Satan's pit,

22:11.700 --> 22:13.188
and it will be your paradise.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.100
Here's the thing.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.600
Big Mike's never going
to speak to me

22:15.600 --> 22:16.700
about another employee,
okay.

22:16.700 --> 22:17.700
The man's
like a wall of stone

22:17.700 --> 22:19.265
when it comes to breaching
Buy More policy.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.100
Please.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.912
Every man has
a weakness to exploit.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.900
Mine is Renaissance fairs.

22:23.900 --> 22:25.000
Just soften him up
a little bit.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.500
- Grease his wheels.
- Grease him?

22:26.500 --> 22:29.092
What is that Michael
just cannot get enough of?

22:32.400 --> 22:33.400
What can
I do for you, son?

22:33.400 --> 22:35.500
Well I had an extra
chicken teriyaki footlong

22:35.500 --> 22:36.648
I thought
someone would be...

22:37.400 --> 22:38.300
interested in?

22:38.300 --> 22:39.400
Do tell.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.012
Five-dollar footlong.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.700
- Mmm.
- Oh, boy.

22:59.300 --> 23:00.745
- Chicken teriyaki.
- Yep.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.701
A taste of
the Orient in Burbank.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.140
<i>The flavors melt together
in perfect harmony.</i>

23:05.400 --> 23:06.399
Just like
me and your mama.

23:10.700 --> 23:12.000
Can I ask you a question?

23:13.000 --> 23:13.898
What do you think
of Emmett?

23:15.200 --> 23:16.000
<i>I really don't think
I should</i>

23:16.000 --> 23:17.588
talk about other employees
in front of you, Morgan.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.711
Well, don't-don't think of me
as an employee...

23:21.500 --> 23:22.435
Dad.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.557
You think of me as
family.

23:28.100 --> 23:29.100
You're right.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.105
If you can't trust family,

23:32.100 --> 23:33.200
<i>who can you trust?</i>

23:35.900 --> 23:37.166
I guess
this is good-bye, huh?

23:38.500 --> 23:39.200
Yeah.

23:41.100 --> 23:41.946
Well, thanks for trying.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.300
Ugh.
Ugh. Disgusting.

24:02.700 --> 24:03.712
Oh, God.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.136
If it's FULCRUM,

24:06.400 --> 24:07.600
this could be
my last chance to find out

24:07.601 --> 24:08.400
where they put my dad.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.700
Don't you answer that,
Bartowski.

24:09.700 --> 24:10.610
Bernie. Talk to me.

24:10.645 --> 24:12.400
<i>We're moving Orion.
Bill wants all agents</i>

24:12.400 --> 24:13.174
<i>back to base.</i>

24:14.100 --> 24:15.100
They're moving my dad,

24:15.100 --> 24:16.400
and they want all the agents
back at the base.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.100
Okay, keep him on the line.

24:17.100 --> 24:18.176
We're going
to trace his call.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.100
<i>Yeah, yeah, I'll, uh,</i>

24:21.100 --> 24:23.100
I'll be back
at the base pronto,

24:23.100 --> 24:25.087
but first, there's a couple of things
I'd like to discuss.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.075
<i>Discuss?
Discuss what?</i>

24:27.200 --> 24:28.300
<i>You know,
you know, stuff.</i>

24:28.300 --> 24:29.597
Stuff to discuss.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.100
Uh...
particularly my salary.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.100
<i>Your salary?</i>

24:33.100 --> 24:34.400
I've been burning
the midnight oil,

24:34.400 --> 24:36.374
and if you ask me,
my work speaks for itself.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.838
<i>Bernie, what the hell
are you talking about?</i>

24:40.400 --> 24:43.100
Also, uh, there are
other pertinent things

24:43.100 --> 24:44.300
that we could talk about.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.300
<i>Including,
but not limited to...</i>

24:46.500 --> 24:48.730
the dental plan
and vacation days.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.421
And I could use
a gym membership.

24:50.456 --> 24:52.100
Have you looked at me?
Excellent.

24:52.100 --> 24:53.202
Good.
We'll talk about it at the base.

24:53.202 --> 24:53.630
Bye.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.340
Dental plan?

24:55.700 --> 24:57.592
- Moron.
- Okay, it looks like the call came

24:57.622 --> 24:59.612
from 1600 Destefano Court.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.816
It's an office building
somewhere off Mulholland.

25:01.851 --> 25:03.300
I- I know that building.

25:03.300 --> 25:06.696
<i>It's the headquarters for the
Strength Leadership Corporation.</i>

25:07.100 --> 25:09.600
<i>They run CEO and
management training seminars,</i>

25:09.600 --> 25:10.812
but really
that's just a front

25:10.827 --> 25:12.463
for a FULCRUM recruiting facility.

25:13.100 --> 25:14.775
Why-why would they take
my dad there?

25:14.831 --> 25:17.191
Because they have holding cells
for prisoners on the eighth floor.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.100
We better hustle.
Let's go.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.100
Take me with you.
I've been there before.

25:20.100 --> 25:21.100
I know my way
around the building

25:21.100 --> 25:22.328
and the security system.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.187
<i>Guys, we need her.</i>

25:37.400 --> 25:39.100
<i>Chuck,
you can't trust anyone.</i>

25:39.100 --> 25:40.800
<i>I know it looks like
a boring office building,</i>

25:40.800 --> 25:41.815
<i>but it's run by FULCRUM.</i>

25:56.000 --> 25:56.963
<i>Casey, she's right.</i>

25:56.963 --> 25:58.400
<i>These are not
pencil pushers.</i>

25:58.400 --> 26:00.132
They are
FULCRUM assassins.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.400
Relax, killer.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.800
When the going gets rough,
you can always deploy The Morgan.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.300
Chuck, we've tapped
into the security feed.

26:08.300 --> 26:08.800
I'm watching

26:08.800 --> 26:10.576
<i>your every move.
You're going to be safe.</i>

26:11.300 --> 26:12.500
<i>When you get
to the desk,</i>

26:12.500 --> 26:13.809
tell him you're here
for Auditing.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.155
What,
is that like accounting?

26:15.200 --> 26:16.581
No, it's like testing.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.600
Can I help you gentleman?

26:17.600 --> 26:18.900
Yes, we're here for
Auditing.

26:21.700 --> 26:23.048
Second floor.
Up the stairs.

26:27.500 --> 26:28.261
<i>Okay, now,</i>

26:28.261 --> 26:30.000
go past
the testing center

26:30.000 --> 26:31.500
<i>down the hallway
to the elevator.</i>

26:38.400 --> 26:39.950
The holding cells
are on the eighth floor.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.495
Okay, go right and
go down the hallway.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.400
Hey, what are you
doing here?

26:50.000 --> 26:50.900
Uh, we're, uh...

26:50.900 --> 26:51.797
We're here
for the Auditing.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.289
Who set the meeting?

26:55.400 --> 26:56.848
Tell him Mr. Dornhoffer.

26:56.900 --> 26:57.800
Mr. Dornhoffer.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.465
You're on the wrong floor.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.200
- Oh, we were told eight.
- Eight.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.600
No? Okay.

27:02.600 --> 27:04.000
Sorry about that.
But it's a...

27:04.000 --> 27:05.200
It's a common mistake,
I'm sure.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.400
<i>Chuck,
just do what he says.</i>

27:06.400 --> 27:07.847
<i>I'll find another way
to get to your dad.</i>

27:10.600 --> 27:11.700
You two are late.

27:12.000 --> 27:12.634
Sorry.

27:17.300 --> 27:19.100
<i>Before the test,
we have a brief video</i>

27:19.100 --> 27:19.900
<i>for you to watch.</i>

27:23.900 --> 27:25.500
<i>Welcome to FULCRUM.</i>

27:28.500 --> 27:31.047
<i>Solving tomorrow's problems...
today.</i>

27:31.100 --> 27:33.417
<i>We live in
a dangerous world.</i>

27:34.200 --> 27:36.506
<i>And you want to do
something about it.</i>

27:38.300 --> 27:40.071
<i>Do you have
what it takes?</i>

27:40.900 --> 27:42.355
<i>We're about to find out.</i>

27:43.000 --> 27:45.010
<i>Good luck on the test,
comrades.</i>

27:46.300 --> 27:47.178
<i>You may begin.</i>

27:47.400 --> 27:48.568
What do we do now?

27:48.800 --> 27:50.100
You have to
take the test, Chuck.

27:50.100 --> 27:51.613
<i>Look, you don't want to
raise their suspicions.</i>

27:55.400 --> 27:56.802
I hate these tests.

28:07.300 --> 28:08.526
I'm not gonna cheat.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.400
- You're kidding, right?
- No, I'm not kidding.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.007
Found them on the
eighth floor, Mr. Bergey.

28:21.042 --> 28:23.100
Said they were lost,
were here for Auditing.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.257
Well, let's find out
who they really are.

28:34.300 --> 28:36.402
Here to rescue your father,
Charles?

28:39.900 --> 28:40.720
<i>I must say,
Emmett,</i>

28:40.765 --> 28:41.804
I'm impressed.

28:41.839 --> 28:43.300
The store's running smoothly.

28:43.300 --> 28:45.400
The employees,
for some strange reason,

28:45.400 --> 28:46.300
respect you.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.916
Now if I could only find
Big Mike.

28:49.300 --> 28:50.612
Oh, he took the day off.

28:51.700 --> 28:52.072
What?

28:52.120 --> 28:53.611
Why would Michael take
the day off?

28:53.646 --> 28:55.701
Oh.
You're looking at him.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.089
Please.

28:58.200 --> 28:58.722
Listen.

28:59.800 --> 29:00.900
<i>Emmett's a good worker.</i>

29:01.100 --> 29:03.200
<i>Thanks to Emmett,
I can fish three times a week</i>

29:03.200 --> 29:04.500
<i>and the store
never misses a beat.</i>

29:04.500 --> 29:06.900
<i>In fact, I'm-I'm gonna take the
rest of the day off,</i>

29:06.900 --> 29:07.912
<i>do a little fishing
this afternoon.</i>

29:07.947 --> 29:08.300
Okay.

29:10.300 --> 29:11.900
I came down here
to evaluate

29:11.900 --> 29:14.019
<i>Big Mike
and he's off fishing?</i>

29:15.700 --> 29:17.400
Well, Emmett,

29:17.800 --> 29:19.734
you've been gunning for
Mike's job all year.

29:21.700 --> 29:22.555
It's yours.

29:27.700 --> 29:28.591
Good luck...

29:30.800 --> 29:31.850
Store manager.

29:32.300 --> 29:33.082
Thank you.

29:39.100 --> 29:40.100
Congratulations.

29:40.100 --> 29:41.698
Your test score
was very impressive.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.000
Bill Bergey,
our seminar leader,

29:43.000 --> 29:43.900
would like to meet you.

29:44.400 --> 29:45.738
Bill Bergey's
head of recruiting.

29:45.782 --> 29:47.000
He'll know where
Chuck's dad is.

29:47.700 --> 29:49.500
- How did I do?
- I'm sorry, sir.

29:49.500 --> 29:50.200
You failed.

29:50.500 --> 29:51.300
In fact, I'm afraid

29:51.300 --> 29:52.600
you had one of the
lowest scores

29:52.601 --> 29:53.979
we've ever had.

29:55.800 --> 29:56.981
Come with me,
Mr. Carmichael.

29:57.100 --> 29:57.700
Um...

29:57.800 --> 30:00.300
You know,
what-what my friend lacks

30:00.300 --> 30:01.400
in the intellect department,

30:01.400 --> 30:02.800
<i>he does make up
for in brawn.</i>

30:02.800 --> 30:05.500
Certainly, you must have
some kind of a job

30:05.500 --> 30:07.000
moving boxes
or heavy equipment?

30:07.000 --> 30:08.176
Come with me,
Mr. Carmichael.

30:08.200 --> 30:08.600
Okay.

30:12.300 --> 30:12.900
<i>Casey, stand down.</i>

30:12.900 --> 30:13.800
Just let Chuck go.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.353
We can track him
using his watch.

30:18.500 --> 30:21.100
May I help you, sir?
This way.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.171
This way...

30:28.900 --> 30:29.762
Agent Casey.

30:40.000 --> 30:40.900
Talk to me,
Walker.

30:40.900 --> 30:41.800
<i>I'm all clear.</i>

30:41.800 --> 30:43.000
Okay,
Chuck's on the 15th floor.

30:43.000 --> 30:43.503
He's heading to the

30:43.503 --> 30:44.806
<i>far west side
of the building.</i>

30:45.200 --> 30:46.163
<i>It's a secure area.</i>

30:46.500 --> 30:47.500
<i>You're going to
need a way in.</i>

30:50.600 --> 30:52.700
- Ah, hello, welcome.
- Hi.

30:52.700 --> 30:54.300
- I'm Bill Bergey.
- Charles Carmichael.

30:54.300 --> 30:55.500
Nice to meet you.
Please sit down.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.100
Thank you.

30:58.700 --> 31:00.500
So...

31:00.500 --> 31:02.314
I know who you really are,
Charles.

31:02.900 --> 31:04.626
That your father is Orion.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.155
Orion?

31:09.500 --> 31:11.500
Uh,
I'm not really tracking.

31:11.500 --> 31:12.700
I don't know what
you're talking about.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.800
I'm-I'm just here for the...
for the seminar.

31:14.800 --> 31:15.900
Leadership first, right?

31:16.100 --> 31:17.736
Oh, well,
then you're out of luck.

31:17.767 --> 31:19.389
The seminar is full.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.035
Are you wearing a wire?

31:21.700 --> 31:22.707
That's preposterous.

31:23.600 --> 31:24.625
Are you wearing a wire?

31:24.625 --> 31:25.498
Yes, yes, I am.

31:28.000 --> 31:28.600
Chuck?

31:29.600 --> 31:30.300
Okay, Casey,
they've got him.

31:30.301 --> 31:31.109
I'm going in.

31:31.144 --> 31:32.300
You have
to take me with you.

31:32.500 --> 31:33.600
And how I know
I can trust you?

31:33.600 --> 31:35.200
You don't.
But you need my help,

31:35.200 --> 31:36.752
and we're the only chance
Chuck's got.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.121
You made a big mistake
coming here to rescue him.

31:50.300 --> 31:51.934
<i>Intruder alert,
15th floor.</i>

31:52.000 --> 31:53.430
Sir, we have a break in.

31:54.039 --> 31:54.944
<i>Security breach.</i>

31:56.100 --> 31:56.836
<i>Security breach.</i>

32:00.400 --> 32:01.400
<i>Security breach.</i>

32:02.229 --> 32:02.820
<i>Security breach.</i>

32:06.180 --> 32:07.110
<i>Security breach.</i>

32:07.800 --> 32:08.700
<i>Watch him.</i>

32:08.800 --> 32:10.351
He tries to escape,
shoot him.

32:11.300 --> 32:13.835
Guys, look, honestly,
I'm not going to try and escape.

32:13.870 --> 32:14.667
Scout's honor.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.200
<i>CIA intrusion.
Get everyone out.</i>

32:21.200 --> 32:22.200
We're out of here.

32:44.200 --> 32:45.452
Looks like
I passed that test.

32:45.600 --> 32:46.300
Where's Sarah?

32:48.500 --> 32:49.400
She came to
rescue you,

32:49.400 --> 32:50.935
got pinned down
by some FULCRUM agents.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.243
Okay...
Let's go get my dad.

32:55.278 --> 32:57.026
Your test-taking skills
won't do any good out there.

32:57.100 --> 32:57.700
Get on the computer.

32:57.700 --> 32:58.900
Find out
which room he's in.

33:03.003 --> 33:05.157
<i>Please exit in
an orderly fashion.</i>

33:13.100 --> 33:14.397
<i>Jill,
which office is Chuck in?</i>

33:15.500 --> 33:15.900
Jill?

33:17.500 --> 33:18.800
<i>Casey,
Jill escaped.</i>

33:21.200 --> 33:22.162
Let's go, let's go.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.700
Destroy
the hard drives!

33:32.600 --> 33:34.403
Go to Cell 11.
Move Orion to Black Rock.

33:34.438 --> 33:36.000
<i>No time to waste.
Orion's too valuable.</i>

33:36.000 --> 33:37.300
<i>We'll talk again
at Black Rock.</i>

33:41.800 --> 33:43.460
Get away from
that computer now.

33:44.600 --> 33:45.679
I just want
my father back.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.400
Good news, bad news,
Charles.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.400
The good news
is that your father

33:49.400 --> 33:51.100
is too valuable
for us to kill.

33:51.100 --> 33:52.000
<i>The bad news?</i>

33:52.400 --> 33:53.242
You're not.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.246
Now,
step away from the...

33:55.281 --> 33:55.884
Whoa!

34:00.900 --> 34:02.031
What is it
with that move?

34:03.800 --> 34:04.423
Help.

34:04.600 --> 34:05.809
- Oh, God.
- Help me.

34:06.200 --> 34:06.842
Help!

34:13.199 --> 34:13.652
<i>Help!</i>

34:13.697 --> 34:15.900
<i>Please, please, somebody,
I need help!</i>

34:16.800 --> 34:18.500
- Pull me up!
- I'm trying!

34:19.000 --> 34:19.600
I'm trying!

34:20.100 --> 34:22.405
Look, please, please,
tell me where my father is.

34:22.440 --> 34:23.676
Or what,
you'll drop me?

34:24.000 --> 34:24.871
I'd never drop you.

34:24.906 --> 34:26.413
That's a horrible thing
to do to somebody.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.212
Really?

34:28.699 --> 34:30.699
Yeah,
it's a 15-story fall.

34:30.699 --> 34:32.000
<i>It's an awful way
to die.</i>

34:33.199 --> 34:34.848
Pull me up.
I'll talk.

34:35.100 --> 34:35.757
Hold on.

34:37.300 --> 34:38.745
Hold on, Chuck,
I got you.

34:39.300 --> 34:40.946
No, he's slipping.
Hurry, he's slipping.

34:42.600 --> 34:43.199
Hold on.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.300
- Oh, God...
- Oh, God.

34:54.699 --> 34:56.199
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

34:56.199 --> 34:57.570
Look, we have to get
to my dad now.

34:57.700 --> 34:59.000
Eighth floor.
Let's go.

35:08.736 --> 35:09.989
That's for flunking me.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.200
- Miss me?
- Yeah, immensely.

35:15.200 --> 35:15.817
Jill's gone.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.700
- What happened?
- Well, he attacked me.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.409
I did The Morgan,
and he flew out the window.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.300
Two kills in
two days, Chuck.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.300
Wow, that Morgan move
really is killer.

35:28.500 --> 35:29.200
Dad!

35:32.200 --> 35:33.000
<i>We're too late.</i>

35:37.000 --> 35:38.287
I'm never going to find him,
am I?

35:38.500 --> 35:40.037
Wait,
I-I overhead them say

35:40.037 --> 35:40.900
that they were
moving your father

35:40.900 --> 35:43.595
to a place I never heard of,
a place called Black Rock.

35:50.200 --> 35:51.100
Oh, my God.

35:51.100 --> 35:52.078
I know where
they're taking him.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.100
Black Rock is a code name
for Protocol Seven,

35:55.100 --> 35:56.884
a secret FULCRUM base
in Barstow.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.647
How do you know that,
Chuck?

35:59.100 --> 36:00.011
You don't want to know.

36:00.300 --> 36:01.600
Chuck,
can you hear me?

36:01.900 --> 36:03.038
<i>I'm on the eighth floor.</i>

36:03.600 --> 36:04.906
<i>They've already
evacuated my dad.</i>

36:04.941 --> 36:05.900
Okay, hold tight.

36:05.900 --> 36:07.100
- We're on our way.
- Okay, come on.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.400
What are you doing?

36:13.400 --> 36:14.000
Don't move.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.500
Look, Jill,
there was no deal.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.300
<i>I lied to you because,
at the time,</i>

36:20.300 --> 36:21.300
<i>I was willing to do
whatever it took</i>

36:21.300 --> 36:24.100
to find my father.
But not anymore.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.300
<i>You held up your side
of the bargain,</i>

36:26.300 --> 36:27.500
<i>and I'm going to
hold up mine.</i>

36:28.000 --> 36:29.579
I told you
I wouldn't let them change me,

36:29.579 --> 36:30.270
and I won't.

36:30.400 --> 36:31.900
Thank you, Chuck.

36:32.100 --> 36:33.500
Look, you should go
before they get here.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.200
Okay.

36:35.800 --> 36:36.400
But, Jill...

36:37.500 --> 36:38.800
Look, you're going to be
all alone out there.

36:39.500 --> 36:41.121
No friends,
no money, nothing.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.334
This is worth a lot.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.833
Casey's probably going
to kill me.

36:51.700 --> 36:53.500
I always dreamt of
giving you a ring, Jill...

36:55.000 --> 36:55.900
Just not like this.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.200
You're sure
you can trust them, right?

37:01.500 --> 37:02.100
Go.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.737
Welcome back to Gen Pop,
Michael.

37:12.600 --> 37:13.385
Good luck.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.900
I know it was you,
Morgan.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.600
You broke my heart.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.969
You broke my heart.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.598
I don't want anything
to happen to him

38:07.598 --> 38:09.100
as long as his mom
and I are dating.

38:10.700 --> 38:11.499
<i>How could you let</i>

38:11.510 --> 38:12.600
<i>Jill Roberts get away?</i>

38:12.600 --> 38:13.519
I'm sorry, General.

38:13.555 --> 38:15.748
I took her inside the building
because I didn't have a choice.

38:15.800 --> 38:19.700
<i>So, not only do we have no idea
where Steve Bartowski is,</i>

38:19.700 --> 38:20.900
<i>we have a
FULCRUM agent</i>

38:20.900 --> 38:22.707
<i>who knows all of our
secrets running free.</i>

38:23.300 --> 38:24.512
<i>Where is Chuck now?</i>

38:24.600 --> 38:25.266
<i>He's on his way</i>

38:25.306 --> 38:26.000
to the Buy More.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.315
Permission to drop the twerp
into a deep dark hole, General.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.200
- <i>Granted.</i>
- Huh?

38:30.200 --> 38:30.862
<i>It's over.</i>

38:30.903 --> 38:33.969
<i>The Human Intersect project
has become too hard to control.</i>

38:34.200 --> 38:35.700
<i>I can't afford to
wonder anymore</i>

38:35.700 --> 38:38.216
<i>if this team or
Chuck Bartowski is a liability.</i>

38:38.700 --> 38:40.001
What are you saying,
General?

38:40.100 --> 38:41.500
<i>I'm shutting down
this project.</i>

38:41.800 --> 38:43.100
<i>Chuck's going
into lockdown.</i>

38:43.100 --> 38:44.200
<i>He'll be
taken to Washington</i>

38:44.200 --> 38:46.496
<i>and put into a secure facility
once and for all.</i>

38:46.600 --> 38:48.300
Operation Moron
is over?

38:48.200 --> 38:49.866
You're making a mistake,
General.

38:49.900 --> 38:51.525
<i>I have made my decision,
Agent Walker.</i>

38:51.600 --> 38:53.400
Chuck isn't going to go down
without a fight.

38:53.400 --> 38:54.749
<i>That's why
there won't be one.</i>

38:55.500 --> 38:56.100
What do you mean?

38:57.100 --> 38:58.700
<i>Chuck trusts you,
Sarah.</i>

38:59.000 --> 39:00.883
<i>He believes
you would never betray him.</i>

39:01.300 --> 39:02.159
<i>Use that.</i>

39:02.500 --> 39:03.300
<i>Go to Chuck.</i>

39:03.500 --> 39:05.500
<i>Tell him that
we intercepted his father</i>

39:05.500 --> 39:08.400
<i>while being transported
and that he's back at Castle.</i>

39:09.000 --> 39:10.600
I trusted the wrong person,
Chuck.

39:13.800 --> 39:15.376
<i>Agent Casey
will be waiting here.</i>

39:17.300 --> 39:18.477
<i>He will tranq Chuck.</i>

39:19.800 --> 39:21.500
<i>Then, he will wait for the
extraction team</i>

39:21.500 --> 39:23.300
<i>to arrive
for his transfer.</i>

39:24.400 --> 39:25.000
<i>That is all.</i>

39:38.400 --> 39:40.614
How can you just
stand there and say nothing?

39:40.849 --> 39:41.700
Beckman's right.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.330
<i>Safest place for Chuck
is underground.</i>

39:44.500 --> 39:45.500
<i>What do you think
is going to happen</i>

39:45.500 --> 39:47.000
<i>when FULCRUM finds Jill,
anyway?</i>

39:54.800 --> 39:55.843
We have good news.

39:56.000 --> 39:56.641
Can it wait?

39:57.000 --> 39:57.774
Computer emergency.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.083
It's about your father.

40:00.000 --> 40:00.687
We found him.

40:06.200 --> 40:06.900
What?
How?

40:06.900 --> 40:07.600
Where is he?

40:08.700 --> 40:10.800
One of our recon teams
intercepted his transport

40:10.800 --> 40:12.200
as FULCRUM
was moving him.

40:12.600 --> 40:13.800
He's back at the Castle.

40:13.800 --> 40:15.000
He's safe, Chuck.

40:16.800 --> 40:17.762
It's all over.

40:27.400 --> 40:28.400
I owe you
an apology.

40:28.800 --> 40:29.555
Why?

40:31.000 --> 40:31.800
I was beginning
to think

40:31.800 --> 40:33.267
that I couldn't trust you
anymore, Sarah.

40:34.600 --> 40:35.400
That maybe
Jill was right,

40:35.400 --> 40:37.600
that-that the CIA was
never going to let me go,

40:37.600 --> 40:38.300
that they would
always put

40:38.300 --> 40:39.720
their best interests
ahead of mine.

40:42.300 --> 40:43.084
But not you.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
You've always
looked out for me.

40:46.000 --> 40:46.900
Thank you.

41:08.100 --> 41:09.309
Take off your watch.

41:11.000 --> 41:11.568
Why?

41:11.900 --> 41:13.195
Because it's all a lie.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.745
Your dad
is still out there.

41:15.900 --> 41:17.000
Beckman sent me
to get you,

41:17.000 --> 41:18.400
to bring you back
to the Castle.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.169
They're going
to take you underground.

41:20.900 --> 41:21.650
We have to run.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.903
You're disobeying orders
for me?

41:48.800 --> 41:50.000
You're committing treason,
Sarah.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.100
You could go to jail.

41:53.900 --> 41:54.530
I know.
