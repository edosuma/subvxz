WEBVTT

00:00.811 --> 00:03.246
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.247 --> 00:04.343
Clemenza...

00:06.007 --> 00:07.750
Robyn tried to
align herself with Clemenza.

00:07.751 --> 00:09.618
I have no problem kissing ass.

00:09.619 --> 00:11.854
I know Justin and Brian got
a bromance going on.

00:11.855 --> 00:14.757
Then, in the
much-anticipated blind taste test...

00:14.758 --> 00:16.459
Scallops.

00:16.460 --> 00:18.561
<i>Justin made
Hell's Kitchen history...</i>

00:18.562 --> 00:20.096
Fig, chef. Sunchoke.
Radish, chef.

00:20.097 --> 00:22.698
Never before has
anyone gotten a perfect score.

00:22.699 --> 00:24.700
You have
an extraordinary palate.

00:24.701 --> 00:27.870
Giving the
blue team another victory.

00:27.871 --> 00:29.238
Third punishment in a row
for the red team.

00:29.239 --> 00:30.439
Ugh!

00:30.440 --> 00:32.208
I don't want to
get used to this feeling.

00:32.209 --> 00:34.210
Barbie, we need some help
in here.

00:34.211 --> 00:36.545
During punishment, Kimmie
went after her new Nemesis, Barbie...

00:36.546 --> 00:38.681
You're not gonna get the easy
every time.

00:38.682 --> 00:40.182
This is easy?

00:40.183 --> 00:41.951
For not pulling her weight.

00:41.952 --> 00:43.919
Don't talk to me that way.
You gonna hit me?

00:43.920 --> 00:46.589
And then, later that
evening, a surprise delivery...

00:46.590 --> 00:48.290
Special delivery!

00:48.291 --> 00:50.159
Revealed their next test.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.594
<i>"To the contestants
of Hell's Kitchen:</i>

00:51.595 --> 00:53.763
<i>Open immediately."
All right, ready?</i>

00:53.764 --> 00:56.031
Tomorrow night's
dinner service,

00:56.032 --> 00:59.034
it's red versus blue menu.
On the blue team...

00:59.035 --> 01:01.270
Scallops, and then
a little lobster,

01:01.271 --> 01:02.938
and I pipe it
into squash blossom.

01:02.939 --> 01:04.807
I do like it.

01:04.808 --> 01:07.309
Me and Justin both understand
what chef Ramsay wants.

01:07.310 --> 01:10.479
Justin, supported
by his biggest fan, Brian,

01:10.480 --> 01:12.648
led the team
as they created their menu...

01:12.649 --> 01:14.250
Why don't we do, like,
a ring mold?

01:14.251 --> 01:15.851
What are you doing, 1980?

01:15.852 --> 01:17.486
Cutting out Robyn and Clemenza.

01:17.487 --> 01:19.755
Are you kidding me?
Who the made you boss?

01:19.756 --> 01:21.323
The red team...

01:21.324 --> 01:22.792
Could do a beer-batter crust.
No.

01:22.793 --> 01:24.727
Wasn't on board
with Kimmie's ideas.

01:24.728 --> 01:26.095
That's not fine dining.

01:26.096 --> 01:27.663
With time running out,

01:27.664 --> 01:29.198
the red team raced
to prep their menu.

01:29.199 --> 01:30.666
What the
has she been doing

01:30.667 --> 01:32.568
with two hours
for these mussels?

01:32.569 --> 01:34.003
And while Barbie
slowed the team down...

01:34.004 --> 01:35.337
Barbie's definitely
set us back.

01:35.338 --> 01:37.273
Tiffany's potatoes...
Potatoes aren't done.

01:37.274 --> 01:39.542
They're crunchy!
Had her team panicking.

01:39.543 --> 01:42.745
Dana thinks she knows it all,
but I know what fine dining is.

01:42.746 --> 01:45.147
With minutes before
Hell's Kitchen was set to open...

01:45.148 --> 01:47.817
The blue team first
hit a stumbling block.

01:47.818 --> 01:50.186
Visually, it looks like
something out of the 1980s.

01:50.187 --> 01:52.388
Not good.
And then, a careless mistake...

01:52.389 --> 01:54.723
There's bone everywhere.
You didn't take the bone out?

01:54.724 --> 01:56.992
Clemenza didn't check to see
if there were still bones.

01:58.762 --> 02:00.996
Had chef
Ramsay looking for blood.

02:00.997 --> 02:03.799
I'm about to kick you out of here.
See you later.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.835
You ready to go home?

02:05.836 --> 02:09.003
Tonight, find out if Clemenza
will even make it to dinner service.

02:09.005 --> 02:11.240
We can't get out
together.

02:11.241 --> 02:13.375
Get ready for the
most intense dinner service yet.

02:13.376 --> 02:15.744
Come here!
It's red versus blue menu...

02:15.745 --> 02:17.913
It's your menu,
my standards!

02:17.914 --> 02:20.449
That's not good enough!
And chef Ramsay...

02:20.450 --> 02:23.252
Expects nothing short
of perfection.

02:23.253 --> 02:25.521
I thought you cared.
I do, chef.

02:25.522 --> 02:27.156
I don't know what the hell
going on.

02:27.157 --> 02:28.491
Lying bastard!
Why'd you do it?

02:28.492 --> 02:31.327
I will nail you
to the post!

02:31.328 --> 02:33.896
As he continues
the search for his head chef

02:33.897 --> 02:36.432
at Gordon Ramsay Steak
at Paris, Las Vegas.

02:36.433 --> 02:38.167
I swear to God,
I don't give a

02:38.168 --> 02:39.535
if the whole team
goes home tonight.

02:39.536 --> 02:43.472
<i>I don't care.</i>

<i>And now, the
continuation of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

03:43.500 --> 03:45.367
Let's go.
Come on, come on, come on.

03:45.368 --> 03:47.336
For tonight's dinner service,

03:47.337 --> 03:50.072
it's the biggest test
both teams have faced so far.

03:50.073 --> 03:52.074
It's red menu versus the blue.

03:52.075 --> 03:54.643
But chef Ramsay's critique
of the blue team's dishes...

03:54.644 --> 03:56.845
<i>What is it?
Grilled quail.</i>

03:56.846 --> 04:00.482
Mm...There's bone everywhere.
You didn't take the bone out?

04:00.483 --> 04:03.152
Is a major setback.

04:03.153 --> 04:04.853
<i>I'm about to kick you
out of here.</i>

04:04.854 --> 04:06.288
And Clemenza's careless

04:06.289 --> 04:08.724
and dangerous mistake
has chef Ramsay fuming.

04:08.725 --> 04:12.761
Are you ready to go home?

04:12.762 --> 04:15.197
<i>No, chef.
I'll fix it.</i>

04:15.198 --> 04:18.466
That quail's a disaster.
Yes, chef.

04:18.468 --> 04:20.336
That needs some
serious work on there.

04:20.337 --> 04:22.304
Holy !
You know, I thought I was gone.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.640
I really, seriously thought
I was gone.

04:24.641 --> 04:27.443
Now, with only 30
minutes until the doors open,

04:27.444 --> 04:30.079
the blue team has their work
cut out for them.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.614
I want this menu
absolutely nailed.

04:31.615 --> 04:33.349
<i>Step up a gear a little bit.</i>

04:33.350 --> 04:35.451
This is your menu.
Let's go, yeah? Yes, chef.

04:35.452 --> 04:38.420
<i>All right, I will help
inspect the quails</i>

04:38.421 --> 04:41.490
<i>and the asparagus.
Yeah.</i>

04:41.491 --> 04:43.459
I'm really worried
about the dishes.

04:43.460 --> 04:45.327
Before service starts,
we have so much stuff to do.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.062
We gotta get focused, we gotta
have all our together.

04:47.063 --> 04:49.064
He didn't say anything bad
about the dishes.

04:49.065 --> 04:50.799
I think you should oil,
salt and pepper those

04:50.800 --> 04:52.401
<i>and just char 'em on the grill.
Okay.</i>

04:52.402 --> 04:54.036
These are all little,
easy fixes.

04:54.037 --> 04:55.771
Let's go, ladies.
Tonight's the night.

04:55.772 --> 04:57.106
I can feel it in the air.

04:57.107 --> 04:58.607
Let's go, Clemenza.
Yes, chef.

04:58.608 --> 05:00.676
<i>Bounce around to the other
side. Let's go. Right.</i>

05:00.677 --> 05:03.412
Okay, red team, blue team,
tonight is the night

05:03.413 --> 05:06.248
that it's the blue menu
versus the red menu.

05:06.249 --> 05:07.583
The girls better
kill it tonight.

05:07.584 --> 05:09.351
We set up for success,

05:09.352 --> 05:11.320
so it should be real easy
tonight.

05:11.321 --> 05:14.690
No excuses. Your stations,
your menu, my standards.

05:14.691 --> 05:16.592
Got it?
Yes, chef.

05:16.593 --> 05:18.193
I don't think the red team
is better than us at all.

05:18.194 --> 05:20.562
I know that if we lose,
it's just because

05:20.563 --> 05:22.331
we can't get our
together.

05:22.332 --> 05:24.233
There's no reason for it.
Okay, James.

05:24.234 --> 05:26.069
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.
Red versus blue menu. Let's go.

05:26.070 --> 05:27.269
Yes, chef.

05:36.613 --> 05:38.814
At tonight's dinner service,

05:38.815 --> 05:40.783
the red kitchen's menu will
feature Christina's flatbread

05:40.784 --> 05:44.086
and Kimmie's rib eye,
with Tiffany's potato gratin.

05:44.087 --> 05:45.854
The blue team's menu
will feature.

05:45.855 --> 05:48.123
Justin's scallop-stuffed
squash blossoms,

05:48.124 --> 05:50.159
Justin's steak
and fried onions,

05:50.160 --> 05:51.760
and Brian's sea bass.

05:54.431 --> 05:56.732
I'm gonna start out
with the beet salad.

05:56.733 --> 05:58.801
Chef Ramsay will
be using diner comment cards

05:58.802 --> 06:02.471
to help him determine the winner
of tonight's dinner service.

06:02.472 --> 06:04.273
And away, 4 couples, table 34.

06:04.274 --> 06:07.209
Three flatbread, one beet salad.
Yes, chef.

06:07.210 --> 06:09.244
On order, 3 couples away,
table 64.

06:09.245 --> 06:10.646
Two beet salad, one flatbread.
Yes, chef.

06:10.647 --> 06:11.914
<i>Two minutes, guys.
4 couples, table 50.</i>

06:11.915 --> 06:14.083
Two flatbread, one mussels,
one beet salad.

06:14.084 --> 06:16.318
Yes, chef. Going in.

06:16.319 --> 06:18.220
Right off the bat,
I already have, like,

06:18.221 --> 06:19.855
eight flatbreads fired.

06:19.856 --> 06:22.024
Two beet, one flatbread.

06:22.025 --> 06:23.692
No answer.

06:23.693 --> 06:26.028
Two beet, one flatbread!
Four minutes, please.

06:26.029 --> 06:27.996
Speed up, young lady.
Yes, chef.

06:27.997 --> 06:30.799
I'm just like, "why do we
have to start this way?"

06:30.800 --> 06:33.736
Can't we talk it out,
hug it out, anything? Something?

06:33.737 --> 06:35.838
Gimme some love,
chef Ramsay, please.

06:35.839 --> 06:37.940
Beets out, walking.

06:37.941 --> 06:39.141
Walking now with mussels.

06:39.142 --> 06:41.543
Two flatbread.
I'm dying.

06:41.544 --> 06:43.612
<i>Christina!
90 seconds, chef.</i>

06:43.613 --> 06:45.380
Come on, then.
90 seconds.

06:45.381 --> 06:48.083
Young lady, where's your vigor,
where's your speed?

06:48.084 --> 06:49.885
Change your gear.
Yes, chef.

06:49.886 --> 06:51.854
Where is it?
It's right here, chef.

06:51.855 --> 06:53.722
Somebody, like,
help me out, please.

06:53.723 --> 06:55.390
All right, I'm gonna
come over here and help

06:55.391 --> 06:57.226
with the flatbreads, okay?

06:57.227 --> 07:00.295
Christina definitely talks
a big game, but tonight,

07:00.296 --> 07:01.797
she's just losing it.

07:01.798 --> 07:04.266
Thank you. I'm walking
with two flatbreads.

07:09.939 --> 07:11.707
Service, please.

07:11.708 --> 07:14.143
With Barbie's help...
Two flatbreads, chef.

07:14.144 --> 07:16.011
The flatbread
crisis has been avoided,

07:16.012 --> 07:18.280
and Christina is sending
full orders of appetizers

07:18.281 --> 07:19.615
to the pass.

07:19.616 --> 07:22.551
Meanwhile, in the blue kitchen,
Robyn...

07:22.552 --> 07:24.953
Excuse me, let me get
the squash blossoms out.

07:24.954 --> 07:26.355
Is hoping to get
her team off to a quick start

07:26.356 --> 07:27.790
by cooking to perfection.

07:27.791 --> 07:30.125
Justin's squash blossom
appetizers.

07:30.126 --> 07:32.394
Are you sure they're hot?

07:32.395 --> 07:34.496
It's just not cooked enough.
Too pink, no?

07:34.497 --> 07:36.932
Hey, come here.
Come here, all of you.

07:36.933 --> 07:40.269
Stop. Just touch that.
Just touch it.

07:40.270 --> 07:41.804
Mushy. Raw.
Just touch it.

07:41.805 --> 07:44.573
Justin's dish is
a scallop mousse

07:44.574 --> 07:48.811
with chunks of lobster in there,
piped in a stupid flower.

07:48.812 --> 07:50.746
Who the wants to
eat a flower with mousse in it?

07:50.747 --> 07:52.447
Hey, stop, stop!
All of you!

07:52.448 --> 07:54.917
I don't know
what the hell is going on.

07:54.918 --> 07:57.953
All of you... this is your menu.
Yes, chef.

07:57.954 --> 08:01.890
Your stations. And you keep me
standing there dying!

08:01.891 --> 08:04.059
Get in the game!
Yes, chef.

08:04.060 --> 08:05.994
Cook 'em all the way through.
Cook 'em all the way through.

08:05.995 --> 08:07.896
This is your dish,
and you told me five minutes.

08:07.897 --> 08:09.765
And now it's not
five minutes, bro.

08:09.766 --> 08:10.966
You never cooked before?
Feel the damn thing,

08:10.967 --> 08:12.801
and if it's ready,
you send it up.

08:12.802 --> 08:15.204
I don't understand where
the thought process is in it.

08:15.205 --> 08:17.506
Are you blaming somebody?
Are blaming me for that?

08:17.507 --> 08:20.309
Actually, I am kinda
blaming you, bro.

08:20.310 --> 08:22.344
Yes, I'm blaming you,
Justin. You.

08:22.345 --> 08:24.546
You set me up for failure.
I did exactly what you said,

08:24.547 --> 08:26.481
and the first order
of squash blossoms

08:26.482 --> 08:28.150
came back raw.

08:28.151 --> 08:29.751
Finally.

08:29.752 --> 08:33.054
I knew it was too good
to be true.

08:33.056 --> 08:35.457
Now they're overcooked!

08:35.457 --> 08:37.860
Touch them.
They're like boiled to .

08:37.861 --> 08:41.663
Hello! Touch them!
Get a grip.

08:41.664 --> 08:43.398
Get your head together.
I got my head.

08:43.399 --> 08:45.934
I need more squashes
done, please.

08:45.935 --> 08:47.736
Hello, Justin, did you hear me?

08:47.737 --> 08:49.538
What do you want?
What do you want me to do?

08:49.539 --> 08:51.306
Robyn, what the
are you doing over there?

08:51.307 --> 08:53.075
Get yourself organized.

08:53.076 --> 08:54.943
The only person that's gonna
help you out here is yourself.

08:54.944 --> 08:57.679
Madam, you're all over
the place!

08:57.680 --> 08:59.214
I'm making more, chef.

08:59.215 --> 09:00.482
While the blue team struggles

09:00.483 --> 09:02.017
to get out of the blocks...

09:02.018 --> 09:03.652
It's the first table!

09:03.653 --> 09:05.587
Coming out right now, chef.
Coming out right now.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.123
The red team...
Two flatbreads, chef.

09:08.124 --> 09:09.758
Okay, go.

09:09.759 --> 09:11.693
Is blazing
along, having sent out

09:11.694 --> 09:12.728
more than half
of their appetizers...

09:12.729 --> 09:14.162
Oh, that is so good.

09:14.163 --> 09:16.265
Away now, yes?
Two halibut, one rib eye.

09:16.266 --> 09:17.799
And are now ready
with their first entrees.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.169
Walking with two halibut.

09:21.170 --> 09:23.438
That halibut's beautifully cooked.
Thank you, chef.

09:23.439 --> 09:25.741
<i>Good work, ladies.
Let's keep it going, okay?</i>

09:25.742 --> 09:27.342
Kimmie, do you need any help?

09:27.343 --> 09:29.344
<i>No, I got everything else.
Thank you.</i>

09:29.345 --> 09:31.813
I'm asking you if you need help,
and you don't want it?

09:31.814 --> 09:34.716
Do you need any help with sauces?
No. No.

09:34.717 --> 09:36.852
Fine with me.

09:36.853 --> 09:39.821
Pull the rib eyes
out of there for me.

09:39.822 --> 09:42.024
Barbie, you see two fat-ass
fingers from Memphis?

09:42.025 --> 09:44.493
I can handle this .
I don't need your help.

09:44.494 --> 09:46.728
Hey.

09:46.729 --> 09:51.066
Oh, hello?
Stop! All of you!

09:51.067 --> 09:53.001
Look, that's the stunning,
beautiful duck, by the way.

09:53.002 --> 09:54.236
Take a slice.

09:54.237 --> 09:55.938
When chef makes you taste
a dish,

09:55.939 --> 09:57.906
you know it's gonna be bad.

09:57.907 --> 10:01.043
Take a slice.
Take a slice.

10:01.044 --> 10:03.345
It's overcooked, Kimmie.

10:03.346 --> 10:05.814
Answer.
Overcooked, chef.

10:05.815 --> 10:08.050
It's dry, it's disgusting.

10:08.051 --> 10:09.451
What the hell?

10:09.452 --> 10:10.919
Overcooked, and the fat's
not rendered through.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.654
Bitch, shut the up.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.323
You don't need to be
eating my food

10:14.324 --> 10:15.223
and telling me
what's wrong with it.

10:15.224 --> 10:16.625
Your menu!

10:16.626 --> 10:19.761
<i>Christina! Your menu!
Yes, chef. I know, chef.</i>

10:19.762 --> 10:24.366
I offered.
I can cook meat.

10:24.367 --> 10:26.034
And duck.

10:26.035 --> 10:27.936
We're coming right back, chef.

10:27.937 --> 10:30.372
As Kimmie
tries to nail the duck,

10:30.373 --> 10:31.740
in the blue kitchen...

10:31.741 --> 10:33.008
Two crab, two scallops.
How long?

10:33.009 --> 10:34.242
Right away, chef.

10:34.243 --> 10:36.311
Robyn...
Service, please.

10:36.312 --> 10:38.814
Has finally figured
out the scallop squash blossoms.

10:38.815 --> 10:40.649
That's really good.
But some diners...

10:40.650 --> 10:42.517
We don't have any more scallops.
That's all I got.

10:42.518 --> 10:44.486
May be out of luck.

10:44.487 --> 10:47.022
Chef, we don't have enough
for that last order.

10:47.023 --> 10:48.991
Justin didn't prep
enough squash blossoms,

10:48.992 --> 10:50.959
so obviously,
my faith in Justin

10:50.960 --> 10:52.561
has just went out
the door.

10:52.562 --> 10:54.329
We don't have enough scallops.

10:54.330 --> 10:55.764
I prepped, I think.
20 orders.

10:55.765 --> 10:57.399
She just kept it up,

10:57.400 --> 10:59.101
giving it raw,
or giving it overcooked.

10:59.102 --> 11:00.302
So of course
we didn't have enough.

11:00.303 --> 11:01.770
I'll take blame
for when I up,

11:01.771 --> 11:03.805
but come on, really?
I up there?

11:03.806 --> 11:06.842
Go and get James,
take your ticket.

11:06.843 --> 11:08.643
Yes, chef.

11:08.644 --> 11:11.013
Hi, folks. Unfortunately,
we don't have the two scallops

11:11.014 --> 11:13.548
because I overcooked them
and undercooked them.

11:13.549 --> 11:15.183
I can replace them with
two more crab salads

11:15.184 --> 11:16.718
or two carpaccios.

11:16.719 --> 11:20.489
This is mortifying,
embarrassing, humiliating.

11:20.490 --> 11:23.058
I just want to crawl
into a hole and die.

11:23.059 --> 11:24.559
<i>What would you like?
We'll take the carpaccio.</i>

11:24.560 --> 11:25.794
Okay.

11:25.795 --> 11:27.696
Thank you very, very much.
You're welcome.

11:27.697 --> 11:30.065
I do apologize.
I'll have it right out for you.

11:30.066 --> 11:31.967
Here you go, chef.

11:31.968 --> 11:34.302
Robyn is having
major issues.

11:34.303 --> 11:37.606
It's not personal,
but as a chef, she sucks.

11:37.607 --> 11:39.775
Chef filed a second order
at six minutes after, chef.

11:39.776 --> 11:44.513
Oh, man.
Let's go.

11:44.514 --> 11:47.783
With Robyn's plan "B" in motion,

11:47.784 --> 11:51.119
the blue team is finally
moving on to entrees.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.754
On order, 6 couples, table 22.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.089
Three New York strip,
three bass.

11:54.090 --> 11:55.624
Yes, chef.

11:55.625 --> 11:56.725
Meanwhile, in the red kitchen...

11:56.726 --> 11:58.627
Behind you, chef.

11:58.628 --> 12:04.299
Kimmie is ready with
her second attempt at the duck.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.968
Nice, that, no?
It looks lovely. Yeah.

12:06.969 --> 12:08.603
Service.

12:08.604 --> 12:09.971
Meat has to be
on point with the time.

12:09.972 --> 12:11.606
I got it. I got it.

12:11.607 --> 12:14.142
If meat fails, then garnish
fails, then fish fails.

12:14.143 --> 12:16.311
<i>Where's the rib eye?
I'm walking right now.</i>

12:16.312 --> 12:18.480
The rest of my duck
came out perfectly,

12:18.481 --> 12:21.550
and I just gotta make sure
I am on point, or we're .

12:21.551 --> 12:25.020
It's overcooked.
Stop.

12:25.021 --> 12:27.255
We've got overcooked rib eye.

12:27.256 --> 12:29.558
It's all easy food,
so if nobody can make it,

12:29.559 --> 12:31.226
then they shouldn't really
be here.

12:31.227 --> 12:33.161
I thought you cared.
I do, chef.

12:33.162 --> 12:34.896
Yeah, so you're just like,
"here you go, chef.

12:34.897 --> 12:36.431
Here you go!"

12:36.432 --> 12:39.334
Kimmie, I hate losing
dinner service.

12:39.335 --> 12:40.502
I'm, like, aah!

12:40.503 --> 12:42.137
At this stage of the game,

12:42.138 --> 12:44.239
your menu,
my standards.

12:44.240 --> 12:48.210
That's not good enough!
Given up?

12:55.282 --> 12:57.583
45 minutes into dinner service,

12:57.584 --> 12:59.952
both teams have just about
completed their appetizers.

12:59.953 --> 13:03.022
Service, please.
And moved on to entrees.

13:03.023 --> 13:05.124
Four rib eyes.
Yes, chef.

13:05.125 --> 13:06.626
But Kimmie's
inconsistent performance

13:06.627 --> 13:08.494
on the meat station...
It's overcooked.

13:08.495 --> 13:11.731
Has chef Ramsay's
confidence completely shaken.

13:11.732 --> 13:14.367
Here you go.
You've given up?

13:14.368 --> 13:16.736
<i>No, chef.
I swear to God,</i>

13:16.737 --> 13:18.504
I don't give a if the
whole team goes home tonight.

13:18.505 --> 13:21.741
<i>I don't care.</i>

13:21.742 --> 13:24.143
I got you right now, chef.

13:24.144 --> 13:25.978
Oh, me, dude!

13:25.979 --> 13:27.747
Confidence, Kimmie, confidence!

13:27.748 --> 13:30.149
'Cause I know I can do it.
You've given up?

13:30.150 --> 13:32.118
No, chef.

13:32.119 --> 13:33.552
Look how flat it is.

13:33.553 --> 13:37.990
<i>It's like we've
finished service.</i>

13:37.991 --> 13:39.525
We're not even halfway through.

13:39.526 --> 13:40.760
She's slicing.
Come on, let's go!

13:40.761 --> 13:42.128
Yes, chef.

13:42.129 --> 13:44.130
Come on, let's push.
Let's push.

13:44.131 --> 13:47.033
Are the rib eye coming?
Walking now.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.834
Chef, this is hot.

13:48.835 --> 13:49.935
There you go.

13:52.272 --> 13:54.807
Kimmie...

13:54.808 --> 13:57.576
That's beautifully cooked.
Awesome.

13:57.577 --> 14:00.312
yeah!
Service, please.

14:00.313 --> 14:02.748
Kimmie has bounced
back on the meat station,

14:02.749 --> 14:05.284
and entrees are making their way
out to the dining room.

14:05.285 --> 14:08.020
Everybody good?
Keep talking. Keep it up.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.955
Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

14:09.956 --> 14:11.323
Three New York strips,
one sea bass!

14:11.324 --> 14:13.826
Justin, on meat...
Walking with the shrimp.

14:13.827 --> 14:16.495
And Clemenza on fish...
Sea bass are up, chef.

14:16.496 --> 14:18.964
Have come together to
complete their first table of entrees.

14:18.965 --> 14:21.200
Garnish in my hand.

14:21.201 --> 14:24.670
Brian, there's onions missing.

14:24.671 --> 14:26.172
hell.

14:26.173 --> 14:28.174
They're not ready?
I forgot about that.

14:28.175 --> 14:30.342
It's my bad. I up, chef.
Come here, you.

14:30.343 --> 14:32.278
Your mind's
still on the slides.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.382
Look at me. Get in the game
or off. Yes, chef..

14:36.383 --> 14:38.951
I just completely forgot
that they were even on the dish.

14:38.952 --> 14:41.487
Stupid idiot.

14:41.488 --> 14:43.723
I'm not getting murdered
on an onion ring.

14:43.724 --> 14:46.492
On a fried, onion...
that's not happening tonight.

14:46.493 --> 14:47.760
There's no way.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.596
Get those onion rings up, guys.

14:50.597 --> 14:53.032
<i>Onion rings, Brian.
Garnish is up.</i>

14:53.033 --> 14:56.135
Oh, . Stop!

14:56.136 --> 14:57.870
Come here, all of you.
Come here, come here.

14:57.871 --> 15:00.005
Look, look.
Touch them. Touch.

15:00.006 --> 15:02.208
Pile on there.
Pass it around.

15:02.209 --> 15:04.076
It's like a
golf ball, look.

15:04.077 --> 15:07.346
No, chef Ramsay's
not having that.

15:07.347 --> 15:10.182
damn me.
Look at me. You don't care.

15:10.183 --> 15:12.218
I care, chef.
Hey, look at me.

15:12.219 --> 15:14.186
If you cared, you'd
question what you're doing.

15:14.187 --> 15:17.389
I seen a glob
of onion that he sent up.

15:17.390 --> 15:19.325
Brian, come on.
It's not rocket science.

15:19.326 --> 15:22.161
How long?
Right now, chef. In my hand.

15:22.162 --> 15:25.898
Onions are up.

15:25.899 --> 15:29.201
Perfect.
Service, please.

15:29.202 --> 15:31.337
Garnished and
ready for prime time,

15:31.338 --> 15:32.938
the blue team's first entrees
have finally

15:32.939 --> 15:34.673
made it out to the dining room.

15:34.674 --> 15:36.942
Oh, this is good.
Yeah, I like it.

15:36.943 --> 15:39.111
Meanwhile, the red team...

15:39.112 --> 15:40.513
Walking with two halibut.
Led by Dana...

15:40.514 --> 15:42.648
That halibut's
beautifully cooked.

15:42.649 --> 15:46.152
Thank you, chef.
Continues to push out entrees.

15:46.153 --> 15:49.622
How is everything?

15:49.623 --> 15:52.458
The lobster's raw?
I do apologize.

15:52.459 --> 15:55.161
But unfortunately,
maitre d' James has

15:55.162 --> 15:57.696
some disappointing news
for chef Ramsay.

15:57.697 --> 16:02.134
They've all complained
that it's raw.

16:02.135 --> 16:04.069
Uh, guys, like,
something's coming back.

16:04.070 --> 16:07.506
Please don't be mine.
Please don't be mine!

16:07.507 --> 16:09.375
Dana!

16:09.376 --> 16:11.277
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

16:11.278 --> 16:13.846
Yes, chef.
You cooked the halibut perfectly.

16:13.847 --> 16:16.582
Raw lobster.

16:16.583 --> 16:17.817
I mean, oh, come on.

16:17.818 --> 16:19.318
Honestly?
Look at it.

16:19.319 --> 16:21.253
I trust you with the main fish,

16:21.254 --> 16:23.889
and you cook the lobster undercooked.
Yes, chef.

16:23.890 --> 16:26.959
I thought the lobster claws
at my station

16:26.960 --> 16:29.495
were already fully cooked,
and all I had to do

16:29.496 --> 16:30.996
was re-heat them in the water.

16:30.997 --> 16:32.264
But apparently,
that's not the case.

16:32.265 --> 16:33.799
I mean, hell!

16:33.800 --> 16:36.802
I swear to God,
it's pinker inside

16:36.803 --> 16:40.372
than Paris Hilton's lipstick!

16:40.373 --> 16:41.473
Yes, chef.

16:41.474 --> 16:43.642
Come on, Dana that's not you.

16:43.643 --> 16:46.011
<i>You don't make mistakes
like that.</i>

16:46.012 --> 16:47.980
Yes, chef. I thought they
were cooked all the way through.

16:47.981 --> 16:50.316
It's my fault, chef.
Fight back.

16:50.317 --> 16:52.952
The food has to be perfect,
so I need to redeem myself

16:52.953 --> 16:54.220
and show that I'm strong
in service.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.754
Lobster claws.

16:55.755 --> 16:57.823
Service, please.

16:57.824 --> 16:59.959
While Dana's
lobster leaves the kitchen

16:59.960 --> 17:03.262
for a second and hopefully
final time,

17:03.263 --> 17:05.130
over in the blue kitchen...

17:05.131 --> 17:07.366
I'm going in two minutes.
You follow me up, okay?

17:07.367 --> 17:10.035
Yes.
Justin is more vocal than ever,

17:10.036 --> 17:11.871
and takes the lead on entrees.

17:11.872 --> 17:13.806
We're following right away
with the entree, okay?

17:13.807 --> 17:16.008
You'll be all right with that?

17:16.009 --> 17:17.977
Talk to me, let me know.
Get it ready.

17:17.978 --> 17:20.378
You know, Clemenza
makes me nervous sometimes.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.448
He's very slow
and lackadaisical.

17:22.449 --> 17:24.583
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

17:24.584 --> 17:26.852
Clemenza, you ready
with the fish?

17:26.853 --> 17:29.822
Yes? Talk to me.
Yes?

17:29.823 --> 17:31.357
Clemenza, are you okay
with the fish?

17:31.358 --> 17:33.158
Yes, yes, I'm good.
Okay.

17:33.159 --> 17:34.560
Justin, I appreciate
you helping,

17:34.561 --> 17:36.061
but shut the up.

17:36.062 --> 17:37.496
I don't need you to tell me
how many we got.

17:37.497 --> 17:38.264
I'm just gonna keep making 'em.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.599
<i>Clemenza!</i>

17:40.600 --> 17:42.468
That bass is cooked perfectly.
Thank you, chef.

17:42.469 --> 17:43.869
Damn, how do you like me now,
bitch?

17:43.870 --> 17:45.804
You know what I'm saying?

17:45.805 --> 17:48.207
<i>This ain't my first dog and pony show.
Service, please.</i>

17:48.208 --> 17:50.276
While entrees continue
to leave the blue kitchen

17:50.277 --> 17:52.311
at Clemenza standard time...
Keep it up, Clemenza.

17:52.312 --> 17:53.679
Beautiful.
Keep it up.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.547
The red team...

17:55.548 --> 17:56.649
<i>Two duck, one
halibut, one rib eye.</i>

17:56.650 --> 17:58.350
Walking now.

17:58.351 --> 18:00.753
Seems to be back in the groove.
Service, please.

18:00.754 --> 18:02.922
But one chef
has a dirty little secret.

18:02.923 --> 18:04.924
<i>45 seconds on the ramp.</i>

18:04.925 --> 18:08.627
You're preparing fish garnish
in a dirty pan!

18:08.628 --> 18:10.963
<i>Oh, hello?</i>

18:10.964 --> 18:13.232
All of you,
I just watched Tiffany

18:13.233 --> 18:18.270
scrape out all the old .

18:18.271 --> 18:20.306
So she gets e dirty pan

18:20.307 --> 18:22.608
and sticks all
the fresh garnish in there.

18:22.609 --> 18:26.245
Tiffany is definitely
a little gross. She's nasty.

18:26.246 --> 18:30.049
When a chef can't be bothered
to get a clean pan,

18:30.050 --> 18:32.017
and saute fresh vegetables,

18:32.018 --> 18:34.420
trust me, it tells me something.
Sorry, chef.

18:34.421 --> 18:39.325
We have 2 million
saute pans in Hell's Kitchen,

18:39.326 --> 18:41.360
and you're gonna pick up a dirty
saute pan and cook in it.

18:41.361 --> 18:44.063
How gross is that?

18:44.064 --> 18:45.931
Look at you!

18:45.932 --> 18:48.834
While Tiffany
tries to clean up her act,

18:48.835 --> 18:52.338
in the blue kitchen...
Two sea bass, one quail, one New York strip,

18:52.339 --> 18:54.239
followed by two sea bass,
two New York strip.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.741
Justin...

18:55.742 --> 18:57.242
Clemenza, you heard
what he said?

18:57.243 --> 18:58.811
And Clemenza...
What?

18:58.812 --> 19:01.347
Can't seem to
get their act together.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.049
I just... on it...
it's two... it's two...

19:04.050 --> 19:06.952
Okay, it's one, and then two.
One, and then two.

19:06.953 --> 19:09.688
<i>Two sea bass. Yes.
Minute and a half on the bass.</i>

19:09.689 --> 19:11.924
He's literally looked at me
like deer in the headlights.

19:11.925 --> 19:13.792
Like, "what the
are you talking about?"

19:13.793 --> 19:15.194
Like, "I just told you.
Two, and then two!"

19:15.195 --> 19:17.363
Clemenza, what's up?
Communication...

19:17.364 --> 19:19.932
It was kind of hard to hear
over Justin's yelling.

19:19.933 --> 19:22.234
<i>We're walking in one minute.
Shut your mouth.</i>

19:22.235 --> 19:24.169
Two sea bass, a quail,
and a New York.

19:24.170 --> 19:25.371
<i>Clemenza.
Yes.</i>

19:25.372 --> 19:26.638
I'm going with the strip.

19:26.639 --> 19:28.007
Yes, I'm ready.
I'm ready.

19:28.008 --> 19:30.209
Behind you.
Here.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.044
One is missing on there.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.812
Where's the second sea bass?

19:33.813 --> 19:35.481
I'm coming up
with two right now.

19:35.482 --> 19:37.683
Why is he bringing two?
One. One.

19:37.684 --> 19:39.518
You're telling me one,
he's telling me two.

19:39.519 --> 19:41.587
Two sea bass,
two New York strip.

19:41.588 --> 19:43.689
W-w-w-what?

19:43.690 --> 19:46.392
Come on, Clemenza.
What the ?

19:46.393 --> 19:48.660
I gotta fire another
of meat now.

19:48.661 --> 19:53.365
Every table,
stop, start! Stop, start!

19:53.366 --> 19:56.502
Stop, start!
Stop, start!

19:56.503 --> 19:59.171
And all because you haven't got
the balls to say, "chef,

19:59.172 --> 20:00.572
<i>i'm dragging the bass."
I have the other sea bass right here.</i>

20:00.573 --> 20:02.508
Where?

20:02.509 --> 20:04.943
Lying bastard, you knew
you hadn't got it.

20:04.944 --> 20:08.013
Why'd you do it?
I really don't understand you, chef.

20:08.014 --> 20:10.649
I will nail you
to the post!

20:18.977 --> 20:21.078
An hour and a
half into dinner service,

20:21.079 --> 20:23.047
the blue team has only managed

20:23.048 --> 20:24.481
to serve half of their
entrees...

20:24.482 --> 20:26.183
One missing on there.

20:26.184 --> 20:27.818
Leaving half
of the diners waiting.

20:27.819 --> 20:29.653
Where's the second sea bass?

20:29.654 --> 20:31.922
And thanks
to Clemenza's confusion

20:31.923 --> 20:33.857
with the number of sea bass
on order...

20:33.858 --> 20:37.795
I will nail you
to the post!

20:37.796 --> 20:39.697
They will continue to wait.

20:39.698 --> 20:41.398
Can I just jump down there
and get some food?

20:41.399 --> 20:43.600
Clemenza, if you got
the fish in the oven,

20:43.601 --> 20:45.569
<i>why don't you give it to Brian
and help her with dessert?</i>

20:45.570 --> 20:47.404
Clemenza, there's no option.
We're not losing.

20:47.405 --> 20:49.540
The fish is in the oven,
three and a half minutes.

20:49.541 --> 20:51.742
What do you need?
Give it to Brian.

20:51.743 --> 20:53.644
While Brian tries
to save the fish station,

20:53.645 --> 20:55.779
the red team has
a ton of momentum

20:55.780 --> 20:58.449
<i>and are almost done with entrees.
Thank you.</i>

20:58.450 --> 20:59.950
Unfortunately...

20:59.951 --> 21:02.286
The potatoes are raw.

21:02.287 --> 21:03.787
Not everything is edible.

21:03.788 --> 21:07.324
They're raw.

21:07.325 --> 21:09.460
It's a first for me.

21:09.461 --> 21:11.228
Hey, Kimmie.

21:11.229 --> 21:14.098
My mistake, Kimmie.
I mean, "come here," look.

21:14.099 --> 21:16.100
Now we've got raw potatoes.
Look.

21:16.101 --> 21:18.235
No, just touch them.
Touch the potatoes.

21:18.236 --> 21:21.572
Can we just get done
without getting yelled at?

21:21.573 --> 21:23.474
Like, all you have to do is
take my potatoes

21:23.475 --> 21:25.576
and put them into a pan.
It's not hard.

21:25.577 --> 21:28.779
That's the first time
in my cooking career

21:28.780 --> 21:32.282
I've heard of a raw
gratin dauphinoise.

21:32.283 --> 21:34.852
You've given up, she doesn't care.
I do care.

21:34.853 --> 21:36.887
Eehhhh...
off.

21:36.888 --> 21:39.256
Don't tell me
that I don't care.

21:39.257 --> 21:41.959
I care about food more than
I care about my family.

21:41.960 --> 21:45.195
This so hurts!
Your menu!

21:45.196 --> 21:48.198
Back on your station.
Come on, guys.

21:48.199 --> 21:52.169
Tiffany, I told you five hours
ago that they were crunchy.

21:52.170 --> 21:54.738
<i>Potatoes aren't done.
It's not a big deal.</i>

21:54.739 --> 21:57.074
See what it tastes like
when it cools.

21:57.075 --> 21:59.510
It should have been in the oven
for a lot longer!

21:59.511 --> 22:01.678
I've been serving the same
potatoes all night,

22:01.679 --> 22:03.680
and now all of a sudden
we have a problem?

22:03.681 --> 22:05.416
When you brought them to me,
you asked me,

22:05.417 --> 22:08.385
and I said they were crunchy.
I put them back in the oven.

22:08.386 --> 22:09.753
We're just .

22:09.754 --> 22:11.522
There is no way
to get around this.

22:11.523 --> 22:12.656
You're gonna have to give me
a little bit of time

22:12.657 --> 22:13.724
so I can cook these potatoes

22:13.725 --> 22:15.492
that were
put up already.

22:15.493 --> 22:17.061
How long?
Ten minutes.

22:17.062 --> 22:18.962
While Tiffany's raw potatoes

22:18.963 --> 22:21.131
have brought the red kitchen
to a grinding halt,

22:21.132 --> 22:22.933
in the blue kitchen, Justin...

22:22.934 --> 22:25.369
Walking with the strip,
going to the window... behind you.

22:25.370 --> 22:27.604
Is once again
leading the charge.

22:27.605 --> 22:29.907
<i>Service, please.
Thank you.</i>

22:29.908 --> 22:33.077
And is determined to deliver
the rest of his team's entrees.

22:33.078 --> 22:35.045
Are they cooked properly?

22:35.046 --> 22:37.848
No? Oh, man.

22:37.849 --> 22:40.117
Come here!

22:40.118 --> 22:41.952
Three New York strip,
all medium,

22:41.953 --> 22:43.987
virtually medium-well.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.756
The three that came back
were, like, slightly over.

22:45.757 --> 22:47.558
Like, really slightly over.

22:47.559 --> 22:50.494
I was pissed at myself.
hell.

22:50.495 --> 22:52.296
I didn't want to overcook
one prime steak.

22:52.297 --> 22:53.030
I was doing fine
the whole night.

22:53.031 --> 22:55.165
I'll be ready soon.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.667
Justin, he thinks he's
a head honcho,

22:56.668 --> 22:57.801
king mighty everything.

22:57.802 --> 22:59.603
Well, you know what, bro,
you failed.

22:59.604 --> 23:01.371
Let's help each other out
before we get in the weeds.

23:01.372 --> 23:03.373
That's the whole point
of teamwork.

23:03.374 --> 23:05.909
So how long? 28 minutes?
Go on.

23:05.910 --> 23:07.312
I was gonna say six minutes...

23:07.313 --> 23:08.507
I guarantee it's not
happening now,

23:08.508 --> 23:09.746
when it should be happening!

23:09.747 --> 23:11.148
The two quail are
in the oven, and two bass...

23:11.149 --> 23:13.217
How long?
Six minutes, chef.

23:13.218 --> 23:15.018
So why is it so long?

23:15.019 --> 23:16.653
I don't know what happened with
the fish and the quail, chef.

23:16.654 --> 23:18.922
Really?

23:18.923 --> 23:20.858
Justin, you know what,
take responsibility

23:20.859 --> 23:22.426
from the time you
started prepping

23:22.427 --> 23:24.695
<i>until the time we sank
like the Titanic!</i>

23:24.696 --> 23:26.530
Own up, man up, and step up.

23:26.531 --> 23:28.232
You're on.
Let's go!

23:28.233 --> 23:29.967
With diners on the blue side

23:29.968 --> 23:32.536
<i>growing more hungry...
At least we have bread.</i>

23:32.537 --> 23:34.972
We do have bread.
And less hopeful,

23:34.973 --> 23:38.108
the red team is stuck
on their last two tickets...

23:38.109 --> 23:40.711
How long, tiff?
I don't know, exactly.

23:40.712 --> 23:45.449
Still waiting on Tiffany's
under-cooked potato garnish.

23:45.450 --> 23:47.484
You should know.
They're your potatoes, right?

23:47.485 --> 23:49.419
That was your... that was
your component, right?

23:49.420 --> 23:51.255
That was your idea
for the menu, right?

23:51.256 --> 23:53.223
I'm sorry, what do you
want me to say?

23:53.224 --> 23:55.592
<i>Don't give me that look.
Don't get an attitude.</i>

23:55.593 --> 24:00.464
<i>You're just killing my steaks.
I don't know, Kimmie. I don't know.</i>

24:00.465 --> 24:02.299
<i>Tiffany...
Sorry.</i>

24:02.300 --> 24:04.001
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.

24:04.002 --> 24:06.236
<i>No, you're not!
Yes, I am.</i>

24:06.237 --> 24:07.871
<i>You're the sloppiest cook I've
ever seen my whole entire life.</i>

24:07.872 --> 24:09.773
Sorry.
No, you're not!

24:09.774 --> 24:12.176
Okay, I'm not.

24:12.177 --> 24:13.877
You have such
a attitude.

24:13.878 --> 24:15.045
Why don't you take a walk,
and, Dana,

24:15.046 --> 24:16.880
<i>take over her section.
Yes, chef.</i>

24:16.881 --> 24:19.283
Have fun.

24:20.919 --> 24:23.487
Hey, look at Tiffany.
Let's make fun of her.

24:23.488 --> 24:25.255
I don't care about anything,
apparently,

24:25.256 --> 24:26.924
so what the ?

24:26.925 --> 24:29.226
You all just made me look
like a idiot. Bye.

24:29.227 --> 24:30.794
Come on, guys.

24:30.795 --> 24:32.796
Let's finish it out.
Let's finish it out.

24:32.797 --> 24:33.797
How long?

24:33.798 --> 24:35.599
Potatoes are not ready.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.833
<i>We're just waiting
on the potatoes.</i>

24:38.002 --> 24:40.237
<i>How do those potatoes look,
Dana?</i>

24:40.238 --> 24:42.806
No.
They're crunchy!

24:42.807 --> 24:46.743
So I ad cream,
and I put 'em in the oven...

24:46.744 --> 24:49.146
Again...

24:49.147 --> 24:55.152
And again...And again...
And again.

24:55.153 --> 24:57.187
No matter how much
I cook these potatoes,

24:57.188 --> 24:59.022
they are still crunchy.

25:03.228 --> 25:04.861
the last ticket!

25:04.862 --> 25:06.930
Dude, these still aren't
done.

25:06.931 --> 25:09.233
In spite of being
a couple of tables away

25:09.234 --> 25:10.834
from completing their service,

25:10.835 --> 25:12.669
the red team is stuck
in neutral

25:12.670 --> 25:14.338
by the mystifying potatoes.

25:14.339 --> 25:17.174
I told her they were
mad-crunchy, dude.

25:17.175 --> 25:20.277
Meanwhile, the blue team,
who have struggled all night...

25:20.278 --> 25:23.080
Last table.
Is somehow at the finish line.

25:23.081 --> 25:25.115
Get this last table.
Come on, do it right.

25:25.116 --> 25:27.050
Where's the bass?

25:27.051 --> 25:29.386
Where's the other bass?
The other bass?

25:29.387 --> 25:30.988
I just pulled it out
of the oven.

25:30.989 --> 25:32.122
I don't like the way it looks.

25:32.123 --> 25:34.358
I think it needs more sear.
Don't like it.

25:34.359 --> 25:35.792
I just want some color
on top of it.

25:35.793 --> 25:37.094
I didn't like the color.

25:37.095 --> 25:39.563
A little bit of fish here,
a little bit there.

25:39.564 --> 25:41.898
You're stuffing you're face
with dessert.

25:41.899 --> 25:44.001
Hey, all of you, come here!

25:44.002 --> 25:46.270
Put that one down.

25:49.207 --> 25:51.108
A blind man
can see that's raw.

25:51.109 --> 25:53.744
Raw. Raw.

25:53.745 --> 25:56.346
It's my fault.
It's my fault.

25:56.347 --> 25:58.248
Honestly, your menu...

25:58.249 --> 26:00.584
Your menu, your menu,
your menu!

26:00.585 --> 26:04.254
You give me that
followed by that.

26:04.255 --> 26:08.292
You, you, you, you, get out!

26:08.293 --> 26:11.628
idiots.
Get the out of here!

26:18.432 --> 26:21.834
Two hours into the red
menu versus blue menu dinner service,

26:21.835 --> 26:24.070
neither team has
impressed chef Ramsay

26:24.071 --> 26:26.272
with the execution
of their own dishes.

26:26.273 --> 26:29.175
And in the blue kitchen...
All of you, come here!

26:29.176 --> 26:31.778
You give me that
followed by that.

26:31.779 --> 26:34.147
Brian's raw sea bass
has finally pushed chef Ramsay

26:34.148 --> 26:36.149
over the edge.

26:36.150 --> 26:40.219
You, you, you, you, get out!

26:40.220 --> 26:43.556
idiots!
Get the out of here!

26:43.557 --> 26:45.391
I don't get it.
I don't get it.

26:45.392 --> 26:47.493
We just got kicked out
of our own kitchen,

26:47.494 --> 26:48.861
with our own menu,

26:48.862 --> 26:50.630
with our own dishes
that we created.

26:50.631 --> 26:53.099
How much of a
do I feel like?

26:53.100 --> 26:55.468
Oh, come on, man.
I don't know what happened.

26:55.469 --> 26:58.137
The fish wasn't cooked.
Why wasn't the fish cooked?

26:58.138 --> 26:59.639
Because you didn't have it.

26:59.640 --> 27:01.240
Because you didn't
tell me!

27:01.241 --> 27:02.875
Yes, I did.
I said, "two and two!"

27:02.876 --> 27:04.243
What the is
going on here?

27:04.244 --> 27:06.379
I don't get it. I mean,
I'm not saying that I'm perfect,

27:06.380 --> 27:08.114
but I mean, really?
Like, I don't even under...

27:08.115 --> 27:09.882
<i>like, you think I'm wrong here?</i>

27:09.883 --> 27:11.751
But you kept saying,
"I got two steak."

27:11.752 --> 27:13.786
What do you mean?
It was the second ticket.

27:13.787 --> 27:15.488
You kept telling me
this is what you need now.

27:15.489 --> 27:17.023
<i>No, I said that's the final
ticket...</i>

27:17.024 --> 27:18.958
<i>the final ticket was
two and two.</i>

27:18.959 --> 27:21.160
<i>But you didn't say that.
Yes, I did.</i>

27:21.161 --> 27:23.963
While the blue
team plays the blame game,

27:23.964 --> 27:25.631
back in their kitchen...

27:25.632 --> 27:27.767
Scott, two bass in, please.
Two New York strip.

27:27.768 --> 27:29.669
Two new Yorks are out
and resting.

27:29.670 --> 27:31.938
Chef Ramsay and chef Scott

27:31.939 --> 27:33.506
complete the final table.

27:33.507 --> 27:36.576
James...That's what
they should look like.

27:36.577 --> 27:38.811
Go, please.

27:38.812 --> 27:40.279
Thank you very much.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.581
Meanwhile, in the red kitchen,

27:41.582 --> 27:43.115
"potatogate" is over,

27:43.116 --> 27:46.352
and the final table
is now being served.

27:46.353 --> 27:48.221
Okay. Let's go.

27:48.222 --> 27:51.657
The potatoes finally finish,
and I'm like, "oh, thank God."

27:51.658 --> 27:53.693
That is not what I expected.

27:53.694 --> 27:56.128
Switch off, clear down,
and off!

27:56.129 --> 27:58.331
Well, at least we didn't
get kicked out of the kitchen.

27:58.332 --> 27:59.866
<i>Oh, nobody's in there?
No.</i>

27:59.867 --> 28:01.200
<i>They all got kicked out?
Yeah.</i>

28:01.201 --> 28:03.002
Oh, my God, I didn't know that.

28:03.003 --> 28:05.271
It is always good news
to hear that the blue team

28:05.272 --> 28:07.273
has been kicked out
of the kitchen.

28:07.274 --> 28:12.845
At least we know we're not
the losing team tonight.

28:12.846 --> 28:14.514
All of you, listen carefully.

28:14.515 --> 28:18.684
I have in my hand
the comment cards.

28:18.685 --> 28:21.888
I was hoping that they would
decide the winning team.

28:27.361 --> 28:33.165
Tonight, it was the most
shocking dinner service yet.

28:33.166 --> 28:35.201
Here's the sad news.

28:35.202 --> 28:40.406
Your menu, your creativity,
your execution,

28:40.407 --> 28:42.642
and supposedly your teamwork.

28:42.643 --> 28:47.446
<i>Blue team... Embarrassing.
I mean, really embarrassing!</i>

28:47.447 --> 28:49.649
It's like you just didn't care.

28:49.650 --> 28:53.519
And ladies, raw potatoes.

28:53.520 --> 28:58.391
And then, Dana...
Raw lobster.

28:58.392 --> 29:01.661
I expected tonight
to be your absolute best.

29:01.662 --> 29:04.263
Unfortunately,
it's gone down in history

29:04.264 --> 29:06.499
as one of your worst.

29:06.500 --> 29:10.236
There will be no winning team.

29:10.237 --> 29:11.837
I'm so confused right now.

29:11.838 --> 29:13.973
Somebody tell me
what the hell's going on!

29:13.974 --> 29:16.442
I don't even know what to say.

29:16.443 --> 29:18.177
I really thought we had this.

29:18.178 --> 29:20.012
Both teams, decide
which two people

29:20.013 --> 29:21.814
you want to nominate
to lose from your team.

29:21.815 --> 29:24.617
off.

29:24.618 --> 29:26.719
We all busted
our asses.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.754
To get so close, you know,

29:28.755 --> 29:30.623
to put in such an effort,
to fall flat,

29:30.624 --> 29:33.359
it just hurts, man,
it hurts.

29:33.360 --> 29:37.730
Who wants to start?

29:37.731 --> 29:41.367
I say Robyn.

29:41.368 --> 29:46.639
I'm saying, uh...
Robyn.

29:46.640 --> 29:49.275
Justin, I did exactly what you
said for the squash blossoms.

29:49.276 --> 29:51.210
It was your damn dish.

29:51.211 --> 29:53.813
I'm putting up you
for failing me.

29:53.814 --> 29:56.115
You know, if someone really
needs help, that's one thing.

29:56.116 --> 29:57.483
If you don't know how
to cook squash blossoms,

29:57.484 --> 29:58.818
that's your fault, not mine.

29:58.819 --> 30:00.453
What did chef Ramsay say
yesterday?

30:00.454 --> 30:02.521
Hold your own station down.
And ask for help.

30:02.522 --> 30:03.756
And I asked you for
help, and you denied it.

30:03.757 --> 30:05.625
I can't believe it.

30:05.626 --> 30:07.093
Robyn cannot take responsibility
for herself at all.

30:07.094 --> 30:08.527
She's a child.

30:08.528 --> 30:11.397
I'm not gonna sit here
and babysit people.

30:11.398 --> 30:13.065
You had no idea
what was going on.

30:13.066 --> 30:14.567
Do you know why?

30:14.568 --> 30:16.369
Because they were all
different sizes!

30:16.370 --> 30:17.670
No . What, do you think
every squash blossom

30:17.671 --> 30:19.305
grows the same size?
Are you out of your mind?

30:19.306 --> 30:20.773
You set me up
for failure, bro.

30:20.774 --> 30:23.576
As a "leader," you should have
set me up for success.

30:26.446 --> 30:28.414
Justin, you know what,
have respect.

30:28.415 --> 30:29.682
<i>Have respect.
No one cares!</i>

30:29.683 --> 30:30.983
No one cares?

30:30.984 --> 30:33.719
He don't care
and he don't care.

30:33.720 --> 30:37.189
<i>Clemenza?</i>

30:37.190 --> 30:38.758
As much as I don't want
to work with Robyn,

30:38.759 --> 30:40.292
Justin scares me.

30:40.293 --> 30:42.261
I'm still kinda conflicted
about the decision,

30:42.262 --> 30:44.196
but this is my chance
to jump ahead of my competition

30:44.197 --> 30:45.898
and try to send Justin home.

30:45.899 --> 30:48.534
I gotta say...

30:56.279 --> 30:58.413
off.

30:58.414 --> 31:00.249
After failing
to successfully deliver

31:00.250 --> 31:01.950
on the menus they designed,

31:01.951 --> 31:04.987
each team was asked
to nominate two chefs.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.388
Justin and Brian
have chosen Robyn

31:06.389 --> 31:08.423
as their first nominee,

31:08.424 --> 31:11.893
leaving Clemenza
with the last word.

31:11.894 --> 31:13.662
I gotta say Robyn,
even though Robyn tried.

31:13.663 --> 31:16.398
I'm not gonna put myself up.

31:16.399 --> 31:19.334
Robyn, you're a idiot.

31:19.335 --> 31:21.303
Get out.

31:21.304 --> 31:24.172
Would anyone like to start?

31:24.173 --> 31:25.474
We'll let you go first.

31:25.475 --> 31:26.908
My first vote is for Tiffany,

31:26.909 --> 31:28.877
based on the potatoes.

31:28.878 --> 31:31.380
And then Kimmie kept saying,
like, "how long? How long?"

31:31.381 --> 31:33.715
I told her three
to five minutes.

31:33.716 --> 31:36.285
So I couldn't give you an
answer, Kimmie... I didn't know.

31:36.286 --> 31:37.819
<i>I got totally set up</i>

31:37.820 --> 31:39.988
to look like
a piece of tonight.

31:39.989 --> 31:42.858
She thinks she was set up.
Set up? By who?

31:42.859 --> 31:45.494
Do you think that we came
and took the potatoes

31:45.495 --> 31:47.663
out of the oven
while you weren't looking?

31:47.664 --> 31:50.899
No. You cooked the potatoes.
They're crunchy. That's it.

31:50.900 --> 31:54.136
I'm voting for Tiffany
and Barbie.

31:54.137 --> 31:56.938
I'm gonna vote Tiffany.

31:56.939 --> 31:59.975
Kimmie?

31:59.976 --> 32:02.544
Barbie, because of how
she wasn't prepped today.

32:02.545 --> 32:04.212
<i>What the has she
been doing with two hours</i>

32:04.213 --> 32:04.713
<i>for these mussels?</i>

32:04.714 --> 32:06.214
Two and a half hours now.

32:06.215 --> 32:09.251
At her pace, we'll
never get it done.

32:09.252 --> 32:11.486
You put us behind in prep.

32:11.487 --> 32:13.088
Um, I did the lobsters.

32:13.089 --> 32:15.023
<i>Are you gonna let me finish?
All right.</i>

32:15.024 --> 32:16.792
Are you gonna interrupt me
or let me finish?

32:16.793 --> 32:19.528
You've been having this attitude
all day with everybody.

32:19.529 --> 32:22.097
I haven't said anything
to everybody.

32:22.098 --> 32:23.598
I just have been working.

32:23.599 --> 32:25.067
<i>I feel like,
a little bit, like,</i>

32:25.068 --> 32:26.735
it's not the things you say,

32:26.736 --> 32:28.937
it's, like, the looks
that you've been giving people.

32:28.938 --> 32:32.107
Are you serious?
Are you serious?

32:32.108 --> 32:35.143
I'm getting nominated
because I make faces?

32:35.144 --> 32:39.014
Ooh. Ooh.

32:39.015 --> 32:41.216
Okay.

32:41.217 --> 32:43.418
You said you're voting
for Tiffany and Kimmie?

32:43.419 --> 32:45.354
<i>Yes, I am.
Okay.</i>

32:45.355 --> 32:46.555
Tiffany?

32:46.556 --> 32:48.023
What's the point?
There's no point.

32:48.024 --> 32:50.926
You have to.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.695
Okay, Kimmie... no offense...
and Barbie.

32:53.696 --> 32:55.864
Okay.

32:55.865 --> 32:57.499
Barbie doesn't deserve
to be here.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.000
She can't cooperate
with people.

32:59.001 --> 33:00.469
She says some
about everyone.

33:00.470 --> 33:02.237
She'd rude to everybody.

33:02.238 --> 33:05.040
She thinks she runs this place.

33:05.041 --> 33:07.409
Christina?

33:10.012 --> 33:11.646
I'm really having a hard time
with my second vote...

33:11.647 --> 33:14.549
Barbie or Kimmie?

33:14.550 --> 33:17.753
Uh...

33:20.323 --> 33:22.290
Would I rather work
next to somebody

33:22.291 --> 33:25.093
that's not talking and has
a ton of attitude,

33:25.094 --> 33:26.895
or would I rather work
next to somebody

33:26.896 --> 33:29.297
that is in need
of some direction

33:29.298 --> 33:30.599
and has a lot of questions?

33:30.600 --> 33:31.700
I don't know.

33:31.701 --> 33:32.934
<i>Um...</i>

33:34.904 --> 33:36.171
<i>.</i>

33:36.172 --> 33:37.839
<i>It's too much gray.</i>

33:37.840 --> 33:41.643
I don't know.

33:41.644 --> 33:44.446
<i>Justin, what's your second?</i>

33:44.447 --> 33:47.416
Clemenza.

33:47.417 --> 33:48.917
I vote for Brian because
he did up

33:48.918 --> 33:49.818
on the onion straws

33:49.819 --> 33:51.953
and the
two raw sea basses.

33:51.954 --> 33:53.789
What the ?

33:53.790 --> 33:55.157
<i>Brian, you're up.</i>

33:55.158 --> 33:56.658
There's no way that Justin's

33:56.659 --> 33:58.059
gonna vote for Brian,

33:58.060 --> 33:59.895
or Brian's gonna vote
for Justin.

33:59.896 --> 34:01.696
'Cause they've got this
bromance going on.

34:01.697 --> 34:03.732
I think they sleep on top
of each other at night.

34:07.670 --> 34:09.070
Clemenza.

34:09.071 --> 34:11.039
I don't think I deserve
to be up there.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.108
Abso--lutely,
positively no way

34:13.109 --> 34:14.409
should I deserve
to be standing.

34:14.409 --> 34:15.610
I don't think it's me.

34:15.610 --> 34:17.679
He had raw onions,
up onions,

34:17.679 --> 34:19.781
a bunch of different ,
but I go up again?

34:19.782 --> 34:21.483
I don't think I deserve
to go up.

34:37.867 --> 34:41.036
Each of you have
all had moments

34:41.036 --> 34:42.571
where you've shown me
you can cook

34:42.572 --> 34:44.039
at a phenomenal level.

34:44.040 --> 34:48.844
And that's why tonight
was so frustrating.

34:48.844 --> 34:50.812
Brian.
Yes, chef.

34:50.813 --> 34:51.947
First nominee and why?

34:51.947 --> 34:55.283
First nominee is Robyn.

34:55.284 --> 34:58.653
<i>She got hit pretty hard in the appetizers.
Yeah, I'll say.</i>

34:58.654 --> 35:00.455
What's so funny, Robyn?
Help me to understand.

35:00.456 --> 35:02.023
Because before service
tonight, chef,

35:02.024 --> 35:03.325
I asked for help.

35:03.326 --> 35:05.794
<i>And Justin's response
to me was,</i>

35:05.795 --> 35:07.796
"If I don't have
too much meat to sear."

35:07.797 --> 35:09.831
What did she want me
to do, chef?

35:09.832 --> 35:11.500
I'm not gonna spoon-feed her.
Excuse me for one second.

35:11.501 --> 35:12.267
I've never had to deal
with turmoil on this team

35:12.268 --> 35:13.702
<i>the whole time.</i>

35:13.703 --> 35:15.704
Now I have to deal
with this, chef,

35:15.705 --> 35:17.239
<i>and honestly, I don't want
to deal with this .</i>

35:17.240 --> 35:18.573
I'm really embarrassed
right now. Sorry, chef.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.375
I'm embarrassed that we got
thrown out of tonight's service.

35:20.376 --> 35:21.142
I'm embarrassed that
you're still talking.

35:21.143 --> 35:23.512
That's a leader?

35:27.783 --> 35:30.252
Brian, second nominee and why?

35:30.253 --> 35:33.588
Uh, second nominee is...

35:33.589 --> 35:35.290
Clemenza tonight, chef.

35:35.291 --> 35:36.758
<i>Clemenza?
Yes, chef.</i>

35:36.759 --> 35:38.627
Why?
He had a few hiccups on fish.

35:38.628 --> 35:40.195
Whoop-de--do!

35:40.196 --> 35:41.997
During prep today,

35:41.998 --> 35:43.865
he got his ass handed to him
a few times.

35:43.866 --> 35:46.034
<i>During prep?
During prep?</i>

35:46.035 --> 35:47.836
<i>I'm sorry, I find that
a little offensive</i>

35:47.837 --> 35:49.671
<i>for you to point
the finger at me,</i>

35:49.672 --> 35:51.273
because you're saying something
that's just wildly

35:51.274 --> 35:52.941
bugged out to me.

35:52.942 --> 35:54.376
I had a dessert,
and I had two entrees.

35:54.377 --> 35:56.144
<i>Okay.</i>

35:56.145 --> 35:58.280
And the other two ideas were
my ideas on the menu!

35:58.281 --> 36:01.249
What the hell is going on
right now?

36:09.113 --> 36:11.314
After nominating
Robyn for elimination,

36:11.315 --> 36:14.050
the blue team's second choice
is...

36:14.051 --> 36:15.519
Clemenza tonight, chef.

36:15.520 --> 36:17.120
Who is less than thrilled

36:17.121 --> 36:18.789
with his team's decision.

36:18.790 --> 36:20.457
<i>I find that a little offensive</i>

36:20.458 --> 36:21.758
<i>for you to point
the finger at me,</i>

36:21.759 --> 36:23.026
because you're saying something
that's just wildly

36:23.027 --> 36:26.797
bugged out to me.

36:26.798 --> 36:30.834
Oh, blue team.
God, it hurts. Oh, boy.

36:30.835 --> 36:32.669
Uh, Christina.
Yes, chef.

36:32.670 --> 36:34.571
Red team's first nominee
and why?

36:34.572 --> 36:37.107
First nominee is Tiffany, chef.

36:37.108 --> 36:38.675
Tiffany.
Why?

36:38.676 --> 36:40.744
We hit a couple bumps
throughout the night,

36:40.745 --> 36:42.412
but we felt like
we could have pushed through it

36:42.413 --> 36:44.080
<i>if the au gratin was
cooked through.</i>

36:44.081 --> 36:48.785
And that's what, you know,
basically made us stop.

36:48.786 --> 36:50.487
Second nominee and why?

36:50.488 --> 36:52.771
Um, second nominee was...

36:55.960 --> 36:58.094
Barbie.
Barbie?

36:58.095 --> 37:00.263
It was based on prep today.

37:00.264 --> 37:03.467
We were working out a new menu
and going from scratch.

37:03.468 --> 37:04.968
So her prep was ,

37:04.969 --> 37:07.737
and that's why she's up
for elimination?

37:07.738 --> 37:10.941
<i>So Barbie over Kimmie, right?</i>

37:10.942 --> 37:11.942
Yes, chef.

37:11.943 --> 37:15.812
Oh, dear.

37:15.813 --> 37:19.316
Tiffany, Barbie,
Robyn, Clemenza,

37:19.317 --> 37:22.652
step forward, please.
Let's go.

37:25.556 --> 37:27.357
Tiffany...
Yes, chef.

37:27.358 --> 37:28.658
<i>Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?</i>

37:28.659 --> 37:31.194
I think that I'm a valuable
team player to this team.

37:31.195 --> 37:33.263
I have no problem going
into the kitchen every day

37:33.264 --> 37:34.898
and helping
my team members out.

37:34.899 --> 37:37.734
<i>I love working
with these girls.</i>

37:37.735 --> 37:42.239
I really enjoy being here,
and I want to stay here.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.274
And I know I up
on the potatoes today,

37:44.275 --> 37:46.443
and it's a huge mistake,
and I feel so bad.

37:46.444 --> 37:49.546
I just want to prove to you
that I can do it.

37:49.547 --> 37:51.348
Where's the passion, Tiffany?

37:51.349 --> 37:53.283
<i>I have so much passion, chef.
Where's the desire?</i>

37:53.284 --> 37:54.851
There is so much passion
and desire.

37:54.852 --> 37:57.287
But it has to be
a natural hunger

37:57.288 --> 37:59.122
to stand out on the red team.

37:59.123 --> 38:02.125
<i>And right now,
you're not standing out.</i>

38:02.126 --> 38:03.827
Barbie.
Yes, chef.

38:03.828 --> 38:05.896
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

38:05.897 --> 38:06.796
I think I should stay
in Hell's Kitchen

38:06.797 --> 38:09.032
because I have been
a team player.

38:09.033 --> 38:12.369
They 100% want you out
of there.

38:12.370 --> 38:15.405
They've wanted me out of here
since I've been here, chef,

38:15.406 --> 38:17.307
<i>and I still want to be here.</i>

38:17.308 --> 38:21.111
Because the only person
who matters to me is you.

38:21.112 --> 38:22.712
Clemenza.
Yes, chef.

38:22.713 --> 38:26.182
You lied, and you threw
all of us under the bus

38:26.183 --> 38:27.851
those last two tickets.

38:27.852 --> 38:30.120
I have the other sea bass right here.
Where?

38:30.121 --> 38:34.224
You lying bastard, you
knew you hadn't got it!

38:34.225 --> 38:37.627
Chef, if you want to stand here
and call me an idiot

38:37.628 --> 38:39.596
<i>or stupid, I can accept that.
No, no.</i>

38:39.597 --> 38:40.764
You're not an idiot,
not stupid. You lied.

38:40.765 --> 38:41.798
<i>I did not understand
what you said.</i>

38:41.799 --> 38:43.199
I would not lie to you.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.501
I don't lie.
It's not in my character.

38:44.502 --> 38:47.137
You see, I say what it is
to who it is for how it is.

38:47.138 --> 38:48.672
Why do you think you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

38:48.673 --> 38:50.006
Out of what went on today,

38:50.007 --> 38:52.208
I think I had the least
of the problems on the team.

38:52.209 --> 38:53.743
Robyn.
Yes, chef.

38:53.744 --> 38:55.779
Clearly you're not
a team player.

38:55.780 --> 38:58.014
I feel like I am
a team player, chef.

38:58.015 --> 38:59.749
And I'm sorry
if you don't see that.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.017
I understand that
I should be up here

39:01.018 --> 39:02.485
because I crashed on apps.

39:02.486 --> 39:03.787
But I came through,
and I fought through,

39:03.788 --> 39:04.921
and I try to fight harder.

39:04.922 --> 39:06.656
It's not working
in the red team,

39:06.657 --> 39:08.758
and it hasn't worked
in the blue team.

39:08.759 --> 39:14.064
One appetizer tonight, too cold.
And you still went down!

39:14.065 --> 39:16.533
I feel like I have a lot
of heart and a lot of passion,

39:16.534 --> 39:18.268
and I don't want to go home yet.
I'm not ready to go home yet.

39:18.269 --> 39:20.270
There's nowhere else
I can put you.

39:20.271 --> 39:22.339
I feel like I'd be fine
on the blue team.

39:22.340 --> 39:23.707
Whatever happens today
is today.

39:23.708 --> 39:24.874
Tomorrow's a new day.

39:24.875 --> 39:26.109
I'm still gonna
come in the kitchen

39:26.110 --> 39:29.279
and work with them.

39:31.082 --> 39:32.464
Okay...

39:34.352 --> 39:36.574
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen is...

39:41.008 --> 39:43.293
Tiffany.

39:43.294 --> 39:46.630
I'm sorry, I cannot see
a leader in you.

39:46.631 --> 39:49.065
Please give me your jacket,
and leave Hell's Kitchen.

39:52.503 --> 39:54.704
Thank you. Good night.
Thank you.

40:00.711 --> 40:02.779
I never thought I'd be
kicked out of this competition

40:02.780 --> 40:04.481
this early.

40:04.482 --> 40:08.385
<i>But Hell's Kitchen is harder
than I thought it would ever be.</i>

40:08.386 --> 40:10.654
I wish I could have made it
to the top two.

40:10.655 --> 40:12.889
I tried my hardest.

40:12.890 --> 40:14.924
Chef Ramsay, I'm sorry
that I didn't

40:14.925 --> 40:16.593
prove myself
as a leader tonight,

40:16.594 --> 40:19.763
but I know that I am,
and, you know,

40:19.764 --> 40:21.865
hopefully one day
you'll see that.

40:21.866 --> 40:23.633
Clemenza, back in line.

40:23.634 --> 40:25.468
Thank you, chef.

40:25.469 --> 40:27.604
The two of you, back in line.

40:27.605 --> 40:30.273
Listen,

40:30.274 --> 40:32.642
and listen carefully.

40:32.643 --> 40:35.145
I want your best,

40:35.146 --> 40:37.947
or I'm gonna start
getting rid of you

40:37.948 --> 40:39.249
a lot quicker.

40:39.250 --> 40:40.717
Yes, chef.

40:40.718 --> 40:44.054
I am not waiting
any longer for you.

40:44.055 --> 40:45.955
<i>I swear to God,</i>

40:45.956 --> 40:48.158
I can't take any more.

40:48.159 --> 40:49.826
That's a warning.

40:49.827 --> 40:51.194
Now, get out of here.

40:51.195 --> 40:54.464
Yes, chef.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.500
Before Robyn got here,
the blue team never,

40:57.501 --> 40:58.968
ever argued about anything.

40:58.969 --> 41:00.537
Now we gotta deal
with turmoil,

41:00.538 --> 41:03.073
...schizos...

41:03.074 --> 41:04.641
Enough's enough.
Go home.

41:04.642 --> 41:06.242
Tiff, I'm fighting for you.

41:06.243 --> 41:08.211
It just sucks to see you go.

41:08.212 --> 41:09.979
But I'm gonna fight for you.

41:09.980 --> 41:12.482
I'm gonna get that bitch
out of here, just for you.

41:12.483 --> 41:16.086
I promise, Barbie's
gonna be gone.

41:16.087 --> 41:18.388
I didn't come
here to make friends.

41:18.389 --> 41:20.223
I came here to win.
I'm not giving up.

41:20.224 --> 41:22.625
I'm not gonna let this
get to me.

41:22.626 --> 41:24.961
Even though they've tried
to send me home four times,

41:24.962 --> 41:26.329
I'm still here.

41:26.330 --> 41:27.864
They can't stop me.

41:30.935 --> 41:32.769
The most passionate
I ever saw Tiffany

41:32.770 --> 41:34.070
was moments ago,

41:34.071 --> 41:36.206
when she was already
on her way out.

41:36.207 --> 41:38.207
That was just too late.

41:45.182 --> 41:47.283
Next time,

41:47.284 --> 41:50.186
<i>it's Hell's Kitchen's first
foray into Southern cuisine.</i>

41:50.187 --> 41:51.654
I'm about to rock this .

41:51.655 --> 41:52.856
But does it all...

41:52.857 --> 41:54.324
♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪

41:54.325 --> 41:56.392
Go South?

41:56.393 --> 41:58.428
Stop! Kimmie!
I could just cry.

41:58.429 --> 42:01.297
<i>I've got raw catfish!
.</i>

42:01.298 --> 42:05.068
What are you thinking, Kimmie?
This is not happening! No!

42:05.069 --> 42:06.503
disgrace!

42:06.504 --> 42:08.571
He's about to kick us out.
I'm so screwed.

42:08.572 --> 42:11.141
And...
Let's go, bootsie.

42:11.142 --> 42:12.909
Does Hell's Kitchen's
resident comedian Brian...

42:12.910 --> 42:15.411
How's it taste?
Tastes like fish, chef.

42:15.412 --> 42:17.714
Right now is not the time
to crack jokes, bro.

42:17.715 --> 42:20.784
Go too far?
Stop!

42:20.785 --> 42:23.153
You give me a answer,
that jacket's coming off,

42:23.154 --> 42:25.121
and you're going
through that door home.

42:25.122 --> 42:26.790
Yes, chef. .
How did that fish taste?

42:26.791 --> 42:29.058
"Fish" is the first thing
that came to my head.

42:29.059 --> 42:31.194
It might be a
night of down-home cooking...

42:31.195 --> 42:32.829
I feel like there's a lot
of pressure on me

42:32.830 --> 42:34.597
because I'm from the South.

42:34.598 --> 42:36.132
But it could
turn into a night...

42:36.133 --> 42:37.734
I don't need your sarcasm.
One minute?

42:37.735 --> 42:40.136
One minute.
Of outrageous infighting.

42:40.137 --> 42:43.006
Barbie, she up again.
And intense confrontation.

42:43.007 --> 42:45.608
Shut the up for a second.
Really?

42:45.609 --> 42:47.448
Somebody may get tossed
straight the hell up out of the kitchen.

42:47.449 --> 42:49.362
The blue team needs
to wake the up.

42:49.363 --> 42:51.317
Find out what
really happens...

42:51.318 --> 42:53.983
<i>On the next Hell's Kitchen.
Seriously?</i>
