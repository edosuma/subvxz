(GRUNTING)

00:07.299 --> 00:08.914
LUCY: Previously on
Killjoys. ..

00:09.009 --> 00:13.048
BELLUS: May/present
Del/e Seyah Kendry,
of Land Kendry,

00:13.138 --> 00:14.218
I want to say thank you.

00:14.306 --> 00:16.422
For?
Saving my ass on that ship.

00:17.309 --> 00:18.469
DUTCH: Itook that
jump for all of us.

00:19.978 --> 00:23.641
Fine. Thank you
for all of us.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.983
Dr. Illenore Pawter Simms,
you're under arrest.

00:28.111 --> 00:31.774
Johnny, I need you to
figure out a way to track
Khlyen down with this.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.065
DUTCH: What the hell is that?
KHYLEN: A neuro-link.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.822
We’ll be able to
hear and see each other
as if we’re in the same room.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.820
The army doctor
you've been looking for.
Dr. Jaegar, yeah.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.369
PAWTER: If Jaegar passed
through there, / can
probably help you find her.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.708
Do you remember having
any surgery at all?
No.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.660
PAWTER: At least now
we know you don't have
traumatic amnesia.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.879
Someone doesn’t
want you to remember.

01:05.274 --> 01:06.684
I got something!

01:12.155 --> 01:13.486
What is it?

01:15.450 --> 01:17.190
I'm not sure yet.

01:17.327 --> 01:21.240
It's a ghost image I
extracted from the neuro-Iink
that Khlyen put on you.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.707
You recognize it?

01:23.458 --> 01:25.073
I don't know.
It's hard to tell.

01:25.168 --> 01:28.296
Yeah. Well,
it's definitely indoors.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.837
JOHN: Why is that?
Isn't that a window?

01:32.551 --> 01:34.462
Where?
There in the corner.

01:35.554 --> 01:38.387
Lucy? Upper right
corner of image.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.552
Clear the noise and
increase magnification
as much as you can.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.563
That's him, isn't it?
That's Khlyen's reflection.

01:48.567 --> 01:51.525
So, this is a recording
from his end of the link.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.564
I think we're looking
at the last thing that

01:53.697 --> 01:55.562
he saw before you
broke your connection.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.815
Almost got you, you bastard.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.529
(DEVICE POWERS DOWN)

01:59.661 --> 02:01.197
What happened?
I don't know.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.366
Well, fix it.
Make it come back.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm trying.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.783
Because ifwe
can get more images
from this thing,

02:04.875 --> 02:06.035
maybe we can figure
out where Khlyen is.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.283
Yes, I'm aware.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.710
Yeah, Dutch,
let's get some air.
Let Johnny work.

02:17.888 --> 02:21.051
I hope you didn't
drag me out here to
talk about my feelings.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.553
Well, that's not
really either of our
style, now, is it?

02:24.728 --> 02:25.717
Autotargets?

02:27.064 --> 02:29.225
Why shoot the shit
when you can shoot at shit?

02:29.358 --> 02:31.724
3O Joys says I can
kick your fine ass.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.727
Count to three.
You're on, pretty boy.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.322
One.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.816
Two.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.408
J O H N: Well, shit.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.661
I can't fix this thing
if I don't even
know how it works.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.575
Lucy, if I engage
with the device,

02:49.711 --> 02:53.078
can you scan me,
figure out how it works
so we can go from there?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.084
LUCY: lcannot recommend
using an object

02:55.217 --> 02:57.503
which we do not yet
fully understand, John.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.586
Yeah. Said no
good scientist, ever.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.922
Okay.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.926
Here goes something.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.112
Winged it!

03:25.455 --> 03:27.195
Tie.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.782
I don't believe in ties.
That's just quitting
before you win.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.128
Feeling better?

03:32.963 --> 03:34.373
Much.
Good.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.715
Now we can talk
about your feelings.

03:35.799 --> 03:36.959
Ass.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.375
Why are you so
desperate for Johnny
to find Khlyen?

03:41.680 --> 03:42.715
(SIGHS)

03:43.724 --> 03:45.555
Because I want answers.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.758
He's holding
pieces of me hostage.

03:47.853 --> 03:51.437
Truths about my life
I can't get
from anywhere else.

03:52.774 --> 03:57.484
Good or bad,
I just want to
know my own story.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.317
See? You think
that's stupid.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.024
No, that's exactly
why I need to find
Dr. Jaegar. I get it.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.744
You know,
you're pretty good
with words for a badass.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.326
JOHN ON RADIO:
Guys! A little help?

04:14.421 --> 04:16.958
John.
Get it off! Get it off!

04:17.549 --> 04:19.005
(GROANING)

04:19.092 --> 04:21.048
Johnny, you big idiot.
What were you thinking?

04:21.136 --> 04:22.421
l was trying to
figure out how it works,

04:22.512 --> 04:23.672
so I can fix it.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.345
But in my defense,

04:25.432 --> 04:28.799
in scientific research,
there's a very thin line
between stupid and genius.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.010
Well, congratulations,
you crossed it.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.310
Can you see anything?

04:32.397 --> 04:34.262
No, no. It must
not be turned on,
on Khlyen's end.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.972
All I'm getting is a headache.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.274
Okay.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.445
(GROANS)
Don't touch it.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.490
This... This thing is my only
shot at finding Khlyen.

04:45.577 --> 04:46.737
We can't risk
damaging it.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.238
Or me, right?

04:48.330 --> 04:50.161
Lucy, take us home.
Why?

04:50.248 --> 04:52.910
We've got to
get you to Pawter.
She can extract it properly.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.207
Oh, man, surgery?

04:55.212 --> 04:58.454
Like I always tell you.
Science, it's dumb.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.800
(SINGING)
Come, come, come uninvited

05:03.887 --> 05:06.378
Run, run, run till / find you

05:06.473 --> 05:09.556
/ don’t care which
side that you’re fighting

05:09.643 --> 05:12.430
Gonna get you gone

05:17.442 --> 05:19.353
PAWTER: Hope / don’t still
smell like Westho/e.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.526
Hills threw me in
jail last night.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.355
Hills arrested you?
For what?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.281
I may have possibly
stolen his lD code

05:27.369 --> 05:29.906
so I could look
for your Dr. Jaegar
in the Company records.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.406
You said you
had a connection.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.697
I lied.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.708
So, did you find her or not?
PAWTER: Close.

05:36.795 --> 05:37.910
JOHN: (GROANS) Easy, Paw.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.628
Stop whining.
Yeah, well, stop
digging at my brain shaft.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.922
I think I found
a former patient of hers.

05:43.552 --> 05:44.883
A guy named
Grayson Hicks.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.835
Filed complaints
against a doctor

05:46.930 --> 05:48.761
that left him with
your exact issues.

05:49.724 --> 05:50.804
D'AVIN: Oh, Gross.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.684
(GROANS)
Whoops.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.183
I hope you
didn't need this.
(PANTING)

05:58.650 --> 06:01.437
Shit, Dutch,
I broke it. I'm sorry.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.274
Okay, I screwed up.
| get that you're angry.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.730
I'm not angry, John.

06:06.825 --> 06:10.158
Okay, yes, I'm pissed.
But mostly, I'm scared.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.325
Of Khlyen?

06:11.413 --> 06:13.369
Of losing my one chance
to get the upper hand

06:13.456 --> 06:15.117
and face him on my own terms.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.541
That was my only shot
at taking him down.

06:18.628 --> 06:21.335
I'll find a way to
fix this. Okay?

06:21.423 --> 06:22.879
I promise.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.624
D'AVIN: So...

06:27.470 --> 06:29.301
About this Grayson guy...

06:31.474 --> 06:33.135
I left you messages.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.513
From jail.

06:36.646 --> 06:40.605
I'm sorry, I... lthought
they were personal calls.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.683
And that makes it
okay to ignore them?

06:44.696 --> 06:46.812
Oh, I get it.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.490
You were pulling a fade.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.410
Didn't have the courtesy
to break up to my face.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.283
(SCOFFS) Break up?

06:56.374 --> 06:59.241
This was never
an official relationship.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.746
You're officially
an asshole.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.338
And you've been
nailing your patient

07:02.422 --> 07:03.878
while treating him
for mental trauma.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.668
So, maybe I don't
get all the blame here.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.208
Maybe you don't.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.334
Look.

07:11.222 --> 07:14.840
Pawter. I'm a mess
right now, and...

07:14.935 --> 07:16.300
Oh, please, don't.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.557
Spare me
the broken-boy speech.
I know it by heart by now.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.314
I'll give you
Grayson's location.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.562
I hope your team can
use him to find Jaegar.

07:25.695 --> 07:26.946
Where is he?

07:27.030 --> 07:29.237
Somewhere I sincerely
hope you don't end up.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.869
(ALARM BLARING)

07:37.707 --> 07:39.208
JOHN: ltold them
ifwe dug any deeper

07:39.334 --> 07:40.744
this would happen,
but did they believe me?

07:40.877 --> 07:43.493
No. Now, the whole
damn building is out.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.500
Look, I'm getting
overtime on this.
No, screw Charlie!

07:46.591 --> 07:49.754
Union rules.
Hey, where's
your tech room?

07:49.886 --> 07:51.001
Excuse me?

07:51.096 --> 07:54.088
Your room of tech?
I'm not sure how
else to say it.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.260
You can't come in
here without a pass.

07:56.393 --> 07:59.351
(SCOFFS) Well,
I can't fix it
from out here,

07:59.437 --> 08:01.723
unless you have some
workaround for basic physics.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.062
Do you?

08:04.234 --> 08:05.314
Fine.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.893
Just sign this damn denial
of service and let me
get on with my night.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.197
Right here.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.122
(WHISTLES)

08:34.764 --> 08:36.015
(GASPS)

08:36.099 --> 08:37.179
DUTCH: Are you Grayson?

08:38.393 --> 08:40.179
Are you real?

08:40.270 --> 08:42.431
It's okay,
you're not
hallucinating.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.934
Why are you in my room?

08:48.695 --> 08:52.358
I think the doctor
who messed you up did
the same thing to me.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.274
Do you remember
where she treated you?

08:59.706 --> 09:03.290
That bitch is the one thing
that I can't forget.

09:03.418 --> 09:04.453
DUTCH: How do we find her?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.879
I'll take you right to her.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.124
As long as you
take me with you.

09:10.759 --> 09:11.965
(BEEPS)

09:12.093 --> 09:13.629
Johnny, we're go for Plan B.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.127
JOHN: Where to?

09:15.263 --> 09:16.548
No way.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.719
You can get us in there?

09:17.807 --> 09:19.217
Because I’ve always
wanted to geek out

09:19.309 --> 09:21.140
with the tech-pirates,
but it’s invite only.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.558
GRAYSON: You’re invited.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.728
But you can’t go in there
dressed like normies
and smelling like cops.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.396
D'AVIN: Why is everyone
looking at me?

09:27.484 --> 09:28.815
I can be cool.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.817
JOHN: Best undercover everl

09:34.908 --> 09:36.489
Except for D'av.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.821
You're justjealous
because I make this work.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.909
JOHN: Welcome to Utopia.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.882
What the hell is this place?
A club or a market?

09:54.969 --> 09:56.800
Yes and yes.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.879
Sex, drugs,
meds, and tech.

09:58.973 --> 10:02.340
Everything illegal
and freaky in the Quad
is for sale in Utopia.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.891
D'AVIN: So the doctor
deals here?

10:03.978 --> 10:05.718
GRAYSON: Yeah, we all
call her Dr. Bliss.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.475
She sells
a memory-mod treatment.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.180
Really badass stuff.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.482
You guys wait here,
and I'll go see

10:11.569 --> 10:13.685
if the doctor's
still selling here.

10:15.698 --> 10:16.733
l, um...

10:17.909 --> 10:21.072
I'm going to go
check a few things
out while we wait.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.993
lt's super nerdy.
You guys
would be bored.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.946
Yeah, fine. Go.
We'll be here.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.245
Weirdo.
Follow me, leather boy.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.838
Mood mods?
Ten-minute samples,
first hit's free.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.085
Euphoria in a bottle.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.211
No, thanks.
I'm good.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.171
Wait.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.091
Ten minutes?
Mmm-hmm.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.422
What the hell.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.682
I'm not supposed to
be myself tonight.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.014
What's gotten into you?

10:49.357 --> 10:50.642
You're the one who
put me in leather.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.896
JOHN: You Carleen?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.069
Almost done here.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.063
What do you need?

10:59.993 --> 11:03.201
I hear you're the woman
to talk to when it comes
to fringe biotech.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.824
You ever seen
one of these?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.410
Keep it clean,
come back in a week.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.206
Aren't you a sexy bitch?

11:12.297 --> 11:13.958
What is she?

11:14.048 --> 11:16.755
It's a neural interface
of some kind.
lt's busted.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.376
Can you fix it?

11:21.764 --> 11:23.629
DUTCH: Slow down, sailor.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.680
You're not nervous, are you?

11:30.773 --> 11:33.059
What you said
this morning?

11:33.151 --> 11:36.860
About Khlyen having
your missing pieces?
Jaegar having mine?

11:36.946 --> 11:38.482
What about it?

11:38.573 --> 11:41.064
All this time we've
spent finding them.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.945
What if we don't like
what they have to say?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.651
What do you
want her to say?

11:44.746 --> 11:46.737
That it's not my fault.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.461
You're pretty.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.343
I take it it's working, then.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.020
What are you doing?

12:31.668 --> 12:33.750
I found her.
She's working
in the back.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.084
Um...

12:36.839 --> 12:38.670
Do you guys...
Do you need a minute?

12:39.926 --> 12:41.757
We're going to
need about eight.

12:42.929 --> 12:43.918
Okay.

12:44.013 --> 12:47.096
This is grade
A mechorganic shit
you have here.

12:48.351 --> 12:49.682
What is that?

12:49.769 --> 12:51.100
New kind of biotech hybrid.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.098
Living technology.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.599
Look here.

12:54.691 --> 12:58.525
This is a fragment of
actual neural cortex.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.852
That liquid's probably
cerebrospinal fluid.

13:01.364 --> 13:05.357
All connected
with chips and gears.
It's amazing.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.192
So you have
seen this before.

13:08.288 --> 13:12.122
Honey, no one
in the Quad's
seen this before.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.200
She is a long way
from home.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.870
l have a connection
who can maybe help.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.042
But?

13:20.174 --> 13:24.213
lflgetherﬁxed,
once you're done with her,
she's all mine.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.293
Deal?

13:25.388 --> 13:28.130
DUTCH: Johnny, get to
the back room. Grayson
found his doctor.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.806
VVeH,lguessl
don't have a choice.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.054
We need to talk.
ltwill be
a short conversation.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.478
That's not her.
Too young to be Jaegar.

13:35.565 --> 13:38.477
But you know that name.
Dr. Jaegar.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.648
Mmm...

13:39.736 --> 13:43.069
No, but I do know that
you need to leave. So...

13:43.197 --> 13:45.233
And I know that you need my
permission to keep breathing.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.485
Oh!

13:46.576 --> 13:49.909
Dr. Jaegar.
There we go.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.076
What's your connection?

13:51.205 --> 13:53.491
We know you used her
treatment on Grayson.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.914
l was her assistant,

13:55.043 --> 13:57.659
when the Company
first brought her
over to the Quad.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.836
Not a good fit?
(SNIFFS)

13:59.922 --> 14:01.753
Well, she had no vision.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.748
She was a total
corporate whore.

14:03.843 --> 14:07.586
I told her there's
a huge consumer need
for this type of service.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.424
We could have
cornered the market.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.424
But, oh, no, she wanted
to dance with the ones
that brought her.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.930
D'AVIN: So she stayed
with the Company and you
stole her technique.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.429
No. l improved it.

14:17.523 --> 14:21.436
Jaegarjust removed
memories, I implant them.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.604
Ask Grayson.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.853
You want to know
what it feels like

14:24.947 --> 14:26.938
to basejump or...
Or kill someone.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.531
I can source that
for you, baby.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.950
JOHN: So where is she now?

14:31.079 --> 14:34.367
Well, we don't
exactly exchange
birthday cards. Sorry.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.197
I guess you're
shit out of luck.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.702
Hmm...

14:37.794 --> 14:41.207
Looky here. All your specs
on Jaegar's technique.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.379
You don't mind ifwe
borrow this, do you?

14:43.466 --> 14:46.549
Little bit. Yeah.
Kind of need that.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.298
Well, karma called.
And she said, "Suck it."

14:49.389 --> 14:52.631
You stole from Jaegar.
Now we steal it from you.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.312
LUCY: Approaching Wester/ey.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.310
D'AVIN: Appreciate
the initiative, Johnny,

15:01.401 --> 15:02.982
but what the hell
are we supposed
to do with this?

15:03.111 --> 15:04.897
Give it to Pawter.
See what she says.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.820
Yeah. She probably
doesn't want to talk
to me right now.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.898
John, you ask her.
Everybody likes you.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.243
JOHN: It's not my
fault l'm charming.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.942
GUARD: You three. lD.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.282
(SlGHS)

15:15.665 --> 15:17.326
RAC agents.
Hey!

15:17.458 --> 15:19.244
What's your problem?
Drop your weapons.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.417
On the ground,
now. Do it!

15:21.504 --> 15:23.665
Boys. Stand down.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.331
What's the charge?

15:26.426 --> 15:28.508
Kidnapping a patient
from a Company facility.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.676
Grayson? That's bullshit.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.674
We're on an
official mission.
Yeah?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.301
Show me your warrant,
smart guy.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.851
Got the team leader.
I'm bringing her in.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.196
(SlGHS)

16:02.879 --> 16:06.042
Hello, Yalena.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.879
How do you know that name?

16:12.388 --> 16:15.221
Oh, I know a lot of
interesting things
about you now.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.055
I'm a curious woman.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.226
And a bit of a stalker.

16:21.355 --> 16:25.064
Or am I supposed to
believe you being here
is a coincidence?

16:25.151 --> 16:27.062
I may have possibly
put a little alert

16:27.153 --> 16:28.984
on your name in
the Company system.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.153
So, lwouldn't miss
an opportunity like this.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.983
I do so love rescuing
a damsel in distress.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.988
What do you want, Seyah?

16:37.079 --> 16:39.912
A little trade,
just between us girls.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.661
My company will
drop all charges
against you and your team

16:42.752 --> 16:46.916
in exchange for a future
favor of my choosing.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.507
You can just hire me.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.081
Strictly off the books.

16:50.176 --> 16:54.590
No questions, no hesitation,
no warrant on record.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.430
l snap, and you come.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.096
You must be one
hell of a snapper.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.349
Okay, I'll play.

17:04.899 --> 17:06.855
But it's going to
cost you a bit more.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.776
I'm looking for a doctor
who works for the Company.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.565
I want 24 hours
alone with her.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.985
No security,
no repercussions.
Or no deal.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.901
How bad do you want me?

17:22.750 --> 17:24.832
JOHN: You can’tjust
make a deal like that
without talking to us.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.326
DUTCH: It got us
here, didn’t it?

17:26.796 --> 17:29.253
I can't believe
she's been on Westerley
this whole time.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.420
Well, it's a big moon.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.590
You ready?
For real, this time?

17:33.970 --> 17:36.052
DR. JAEGAR: What do you mean,
security left their stations?

17:36.138 --> 17:37.344
Who pulled them?
MAN: I'm trying to find out.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.462
That would be us.

17:39.517 --> 17:42.133
Favor from a friend,
so we could
talk uninterrupted.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.810
Is that her?

17:49.652 --> 17:50.858
That's her.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.361
Do you remember me?

17:55.324 --> 17:58.816
I do. You're a long
way from home, soldier.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.327
I've been looking for
you up and down the J.

18:03.291 --> 18:06.579
Well, you found me. Sit, sit.
How was the treatment?

18:06.669 --> 18:08.000
I know I butchered my people.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.332
And I know the army
went in and took back

18:10.464 --> 18:12.000
the memories before
I was discharged.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.169
That was you.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.845
You shouldn't have any
memory of that at all.

18:19.682 --> 18:20.717
D'AVIN: What else?

18:21.892 --> 18:23.177
What else did you
people do to me?

18:23.894 --> 18:25.304
Nothing.

18:25.396 --> 18:27.682
You asked us to
take the memories.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.646
After what you
did to your squad.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.184
But Why did I kill them?

18:34.488 --> 18:35.739
That's the part
I can't remember.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.856
Was it an experiment, a test?
Was I on something?

18:39.368 --> 18:42.030
I can't rewrite history
for you, son. I'm sorry.

18:44.582 --> 18:48.370
You killed them because
you had a psychotic break
in the line of duty.

18:49.712 --> 18:52.920
Then the army did
what it always does.
Covered it up.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.084
Bullshit.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.628
There has to be a reason.
There has to be
more of a reason.

18:56.719 --> 18:57.799
Okay. Okay. Enough.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.299
Can you at least
finish the job?

19:00.389 --> 19:02.220
Get rid of
the residual memories?
They're torturing him.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.430
Gladly.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.345
The technique has
come a long way.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.552
You can get
back in the machine
anytime you want.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.768
Yeah, I don't
know about that.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.229
D'AVIN: Can you give me
back my memories?

19:11.609 --> 19:13.065
Can you reverse
the treatment?

19:15.946 --> 19:18.733
Theoretically,
but why would you
do that to yourself?

19:18.866 --> 19:20.402
Can we do it now?
DUTCH: Whoa. Slow down.

19:20.534 --> 19:21.523
Dutch.
D'avin.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.109
It's the only way
I'll ever understand.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.076
You need to think about this.
And that's an order.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.125
D'av, she's not wrong.
We at least need
to talk about this.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.414
Look, I appreciate
your concern, but it's
none of your business.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.753
Bullshit. We're a team.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.247
It's very much our
business whether you

19:36.384 --> 19:38.466
let someone go digging
in your damn brain.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.296
(SlGHS)

19:40.429 --> 19:42.545
When he gets like this,
you've just got to
give him some space.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.925
He'll come around.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.301
(COMMUNICATOR BEEPING)

19:50.731 --> 19:52.517
I've got to go take
care of something.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.599
We'll try again
when I get back. Okay?

19:55.611 --> 19:57.818
JOHN: Carleen?
I'm on my way.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.938
DR. JAEGAR: Hurry it up.
ASSISTANT:
I can't find the files.

20:00.074 --> 20:01.109
Move.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.502
I know what you're doing.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.172
Getting those memories back
isn't about moving on,

20:18.300 --> 20:21.042
it's about
punishing yourself
for what you did.

20:21.137 --> 20:24.004
But try seeing
the one positive
in this amnesia.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.630
I mean, do you have
any idea what I'd give

20:25.766 --> 20:27.222
to forget some of
the things I've done?

20:27.309 --> 20:28.845
Yeah, that's not
the same thing, Dutch.

20:30.521 --> 20:33.558
You killed in
the line of duty.
l murdered my men.

20:33.649 --> 20:36.812
Let's not compare
sins here, okay?

20:38.154 --> 20:40.566
I'll win.
You don't understand.

20:40.656 --> 20:41.862
Neither do you.

20:43.993 --> 20:47.281
The first time
I killed someone,
I was eight years old.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.822
How?

20:53.210 --> 20:54.620
Poisoned tea.

20:54.712 --> 20:58.421
No, I mean...
How does that
even happen?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.008
It doesn't matter.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.719
Dutch, it matters.

21:05.514 --> 21:06.845
Khlyen?

21:11.562 --> 21:13.098
You said he
was your tutor.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.645
Yeah, that's what
he taught me.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.318
Killing.

21:20.362 --> 21:26.028
I'm notjudging you
right now because I
don't have any right to.

21:27.495 --> 21:30.737
So, whatever you've done,
I promise you,
I have done worse.

21:34.168 --> 21:37.080
lfyou can't be forgiven,
then what chance
is there for me?

21:50.351 --> 21:51.386
I'm sorry.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.919
JOHN: Okay, I know it's been
a rough couple of days,

22:28.013 --> 22:30.299
but I finally
got some good news.

22:30.432 --> 22:31.512
I fixed Khlyen's device,

22:31.600 --> 22:34.137
so I splurged
on a bottle of
10-Joy Hokk to celebrate.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.350
So, come get some!

22:47.366 --> 22:49.607
Guess you're
already getting some.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.284
ASSISTANT: Are you sure
you want to do this?

23:06.468 --> 23:09.084
You know, ifwe do this
again, we're going
to need a bigger bed.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.010
I'll speak to the owner.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.631
We are awesome at
the whole sex thing,
by the way.

23:16.353 --> 23:19.015
Are you naked
high-fiving me right now?
(CHUCKLES)

23:20.900 --> 23:22.481
So who's going to say it?

23:23.986 --> 23:25.146
What?

23:25.821 --> 23:27.982
That this doesn't have
to change anything.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.482
Is that an order?

23:33.829 --> 23:35.239
Or a decree?

23:45.716 --> 23:46.922
What about it?

23:47.676 --> 23:50.383
ljust want to know
if I'm bedding
a warrior princess.

23:54.099 --> 23:57.216
Actually, yes.

23:57.353 --> 23:58.934
But that was all
through my marriage.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.644
You're married?

24:00.731 --> 24:01.937
Widowed.

24:05.194 --> 24:08.061
Sorry. I didn't
mean to get personal.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.860
I think we got
plenty personal today.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.950
No, it's... It's fine.

24:15.037 --> 24:19.781
I just don't want
Johnny coming back
and finding us together.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.036
Oh, shit. Johnny.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.703
You know he's going to say
we can't handle this.

Troubles?

26:35.803 --> 26:40.217
I may have
hypothetically walked in on
Dutch and my brother,

26:40.307 --> 26:43.424
how they say,
"In flagrant dictation."

26:44.520 --> 26:46.306
"In flagrante delicto. "

26:46.980 --> 26:48.186
Whatever.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.980
You'rejealous. Finally!

26:51.068 --> 26:52.433
Excuse me?

26:52.528 --> 26:54.610
No, don't blame D'avin
for climbing the tree,

26:54.696 --> 26:57.028
when all you were
going to do was sit by it.

26:57.116 --> 27:00.700
Whoa. You are way off.
This is not... This is...
Dutch is family.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.651
This is notjealousy.
It's like, um...

27:04.331 --> 27:08.870
It's like my brother
is banging my sister.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.581
Yeah, okay. Okay, okay.

27:18.262 --> 27:21.220
Still, we all knew
they were heading there.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.339
Might as well
get it over with.

27:23.433 --> 27:24.843
Yeah, and then what?

27:24.935 --> 27:27.426
It's kind of hard to
have casual sex with
someone you live with,

27:27.521 --> 27:31.764
and they're both...
I mean, they are both
terrible at relationships.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.565
I mean, epically incompetent.

27:33.652 --> 27:38.396
So, whatever this is,
it can't last.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.315
And they know
that it can't last.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.327
And then,
I have to pick a side.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.364
You'll pick hers.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.336
I'm guessing she's
earned that from you.

27:58.427 --> 27:59.792
It's just that
Dutch has drawn

27:59.887 --> 28:01.377
a bunch of short straws
when it comes to guys.

28:01.471 --> 28:03.962

No,no,no,no,no.
He wouldn't do that.

Do you think
that's a coincidence?

30:24.656 --> 30:26.362
She did this.

I know she did. She's...
She's controlling him somehow.
