WEBVTT

00:06.307 --> 00:09.676
After all these years,
I finally have it all.

00:09.727 --> 00:12.445
I'm gonna miss this place.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.315
That's how you do it.
It's two lines.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.967
Hey, 1% d-bag!

00:17.985 --> 00:20.103
You can't park here!
You don't own the sidewalk!

00:22.473 --> 00:23.793
It's nice to see you back at work

00:23.794 --> 00:26.234
and taking advantage of being
in the greatest city on Earth,

00:26.235 --> 00:28.511
despite our tiny and American sodas.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.200
Well, I feel like New York City

00:30.201 --> 00:31.681
is one of the characters on our show.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.233
That's idiotic.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.935
So how was your hiatus?
Start with what puzzles you did.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.805
Venice, solar system, unicorn...

00:38.839 --> 00:41.174
The cast of <i>L. A. Law.</i>
That one took me a while.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.677
So much white.
Anyway...

00:44.712 --> 00:46.179
Good to be back, but stressful.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.015
The usual Liz Lemon
work-life balancing act.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.583
- How are things with Chris?
- Good.

00:50.618 --> 00:53.987
Great.
We are trying...

00:54.021 --> 00:55.781
Really, Lemon?
You can't even say "trying"?

00:55.782 --> 00:57.991
What positions are you using?

00:58.025 --> 01:00.185
The one. There's only one.
Talk about something else.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.829
Fine.
We'll talk about me.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.397
I have never been better.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.133
And my divorce went smoothly.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.669
In fact, thanks to a round
of golf with Archbishop Dolan,

01:09.703 --> 01:10.670
I was never married.

01:10.704 --> 01:11.771
Libby won a bronze

01:11.806 --> 01:13.840
in horsey jumpy at the baby Olympics,

01:13.874 --> 01:16.543
and at work, I am taking
the bull by the horns.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.978
Have you seen the new fall shows?

01:19.013 --> 01:20.613
Yes, I have...

01:20.648 --> 01:21.848
Seen them.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.616
If you're tired of sexy vampires,

01:23.651 --> 01:25.118
then you'll love <i>Hunchbacks,</i>

01:25.152 --> 01:27.520
starring Jonathan Silverman
as Dr. Fantastico.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.115
And do you like the information channel

01:29.116 --> 01:30.436
you get when you stay in a hotel?

01:30.437 --> 01:31.858
Well, Thursdays is just that now.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.893
So what do you think of the new shows?

01:33.928 --> 01:35.795
I hey, Jonathan's back.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.531
Yes, little big man discovered

01:37.532 --> 01:39.532
the grass isn't always greener
on the other side,

01:39.567 --> 01:40.967
and came crawling back.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.203
My grandmother was seriously ill.

01:43.237 --> 01:46.372
I went to salinas to feed and bathe her.

01:46.407 --> 01:50.410
- I'm sorry.
- I still don't like you.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.478
<i>God cop?</i>

01:51.529 --> 01:54.397
"Crime just got
a new worst friend."

01:54.431 --> 01:56.232
The hell is that?

01:56.266 --> 01:58.568
A show I am very excited about.

01:58.602 --> 02:00.603
A New York City detective solves crimes

02:00.621 --> 02:03.373
with the help of his new partner, God.

02:03.407 --> 02:05.542
So God just tells him who did it?

02:05.576 --> 02:07.577
God can't just tell him who did it.

02:07.611 --> 02:09.128
- Why not?
- Watch the pilot, Lemon.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.463
It's all explained in the end

02:10.497 --> 02:12.665
by the wise black man
played by Karl Malone.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.751
You're really taking some swings here.

02:14.785 --> 02:16.052
I have no choice.

02:16.086 --> 02:19.139
My boss Hank Hooper
is clearly planning to retire.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.390
Word is he bought a boat.

02:20.424 --> 02:21.674
But it's not a yacht,

02:21.725 --> 02:24.394
for corporate parties and Hooker disposal.

02:24.428 --> 02:25.795
It's a two-man
fishing boat.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.730
I believe that is called a skiff.

02:27.765 --> 02:31.184
I will not have you telling me
boat names in my own office.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.970
Hank has vowed to keep
Kabletown in his family.

02:33.988 --> 02:37.023
I have one chance to change
his mind before he retires.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.858
That's where shows like <i>God cop,</i>

02:38.909 --> 02:41.778
<i>O.J. Simpson live,</i>
and <i>Rule of threes</i> come in.

02:41.812 --> 02:44.197
- Brother.
<i>- Brother...</i>

02:44.248 --> 02:47.283
A comedy about
two jive-talking con men

02:47.317 --> 02:49.502
hiding out in a monastery.

02:49.537 --> 02:53.790
Jonathan, bring me my green light.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.074

03:07.251 --> 03:10.051
30 Rock
S07 Ep01 - The beggining of the end

03:10.220 --> 03:13.720
Sync, corrections by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

03:16.530 --> 03:19.399
My wedding is gonna be a disaster!

03:19.450 --> 03:22.035
The doves I ordered for the wedding came,

03:22.069 --> 03:24.821
and they're all dead!

03:24.855 --> 03:28.157
One of 'em touched my tongue!

03:29.743 --> 03:31.411
Calm down.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.062
I'll show you that video of Taylor Swift

03:33.063 --> 03:34.703
getting hit in the face with a foul ball.

03:34.704 --> 03:38.134
I'm fine, Liz.
The doves were just a drill.

03:38.168 --> 03:41.203
Everyone needs to be on their
toes for my wedding year.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.223
I'm gonna be a nightmare.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.392
Wait, if that was a drill,
did you kill those doves?

03:46.427 --> 03:48.678
No. I bought them
at the dead dove store.

03:48.712 --> 03:49.879
Grow up, Liz.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.714
Jenna, you're always a...

03:51.732 --> 03:53.349
High-strung perfectionist.

03:53.383 --> 03:54.851
I prefer
soul-sucking monster.

03:54.885 --> 03:56.565
How could your wedding make you any worse?

03:56.566 --> 03:57.125
I don't know,

03:57.126 --> 03:59.606
but it's a fun little journey
we're all gonna go on together.

03:59.657 --> 04:01.223
So when is this wedding?

04:01.242 --> 04:04.327
I can't tell you.
It's a secret surprise wedding.

04:04.361 --> 04:06.579
Because that's what
all the big celebrities do.

04:06.614 --> 04:09.332
Beyonce, J.Lo,
Natalie Portman,

04:09.366 --> 04:11.901
whose real last name
is Hershlag, by the way.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.202
Okay, that's not relevant.

04:13.236 --> 04:14.516
I just think people should know.

04:14.517 --> 04:15.705
You know,

04:15.739 --> 04:17.339
I have a lot of really good friends

04:17.374 --> 04:19.175
I could ask to be my maid of honor.

04:19.209 --> 04:22.845
Paz de la huerta,
the former Mrs. Jon Cryer,

04:22.880 --> 04:24.246
honey boo boo's mom.

04:24.265 --> 04:25.548
June.

04:25.582 --> 04:27.183
But you're my oldest friend.

04:27.217 --> 04:29.052
And also, I've known you for a long time.

04:29.086 --> 04:32.138
Liz, will you be my maid of honor?

04:32.189 --> 04:34.891
Jenna, that is so nice.

04:34.925 --> 04:37.193
But I've just got so much going on

04:37.227 --> 04:39.279
with the show and baby stuff.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.197
God!
My hands! Please!

04:41.231 --> 04:44.617
I'll do it! I'd love to do it!
You're my best friend!

04:44.652 --> 04:47.370
Yay!

04:47.404 --> 04:49.324
You're in charge
of the bachelorette party.

04:49.325 --> 04:52.075
Make sure you have a stripper
there from every race.

04:52.109 --> 04:54.744
Start looking for Indian now.
It's a tough booking.

04:54.778 --> 04:56.879
Best friendies!

05:01.719 --> 05:05.305
Mr. Jordan.
I need some advice.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.873
I recommend you get it from Liz Lemon

05:06.907 --> 05:08.992
or an owl who wears glasses.

05:09.026 --> 05:11.678
No, sir.
It's about women.

05:11.729 --> 05:13.849
I've been living with Hazel
for the past few months,

05:13.897 --> 05:17.433
and while we have gotten to second base...

05:17.467 --> 05:19.067
You mean a threesome with Robinson Cano?

05:19.068 --> 05:19.769
No.

05:19.803 --> 05:22.355
I mean sharing a yogurt.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.940
I'm saving myself for marriage,

05:23.974 --> 05:25.575
and Hazel says she's saving herself

05:25.609 --> 05:28.244
for a grade-a pork machine.

05:28.278 --> 05:30.146
And those are expensive.

05:30.164 --> 05:34.033
It's just Hazel's
my first real girlfriend,

05:34.084 --> 05:35.585
and I want to make sure I'm doing

05:35.619 --> 05:37.787
everything I can to make her happy.

05:37.821 --> 05:39.421
I'll tell you how to make a woman happy.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.656
You take charge.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.258
She comes home one night,

05:42.292 --> 05:44.961
you're in the kitchen naked cooking chili.

05:44.995 --> 05:47.163
You feed it to her out of your hands.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.849
Make her act like a bird.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.719
Damn it, I don't know.
I've been married for 22 years.

05:52.770 --> 05:55.638
That's half as long as it
felt like <i>Arliss</i> was on TV.

05:55.672 --> 05:57.306
You want to make a woman happy?

05:57.340 --> 05:58.674
You listen to her.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.728
'Cause guess what.
She's always right.

06:01.779 --> 06:03.730
The women in our lives are queens.

06:03.781 --> 06:05.681
Honor your queen, Kenneth.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.579
If she wants to look
at new window treatments,

06:07.580 --> 06:09.535
you go to crate barn.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.371
If she wants to have a dinner party,

06:11.405 --> 06:13.573
you go fry up some dolphins.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.825
She does say we never entertain.

06:15.859 --> 06:18.244
You're losing her.
Go get her!

06:18.295 --> 06:19.629
Go get your woman!

06:19.663 --> 06:21.197
And speaking of which,

06:21.215 --> 06:23.416
Angie's been in the hospital for a week.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.700
Could you go find out why?

06:24.718 --> 06:27.420
Thank you.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.008
Frank, you do stand-up.

06:32.042 --> 06:34.093
How would you like
to have your own sitcom?

06:34.144 --> 06:35.094
Can I have a hot wife?

06:35.145 --> 06:36.679
- If you gain 50 pounds.
- Yeah.

06:36.713 --> 06:38.264
Hey, I have an idea for a show.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.235
It's about a boy
who befriends a talking panda,

06:40.236 --> 06:42.076
and they're allowed
to sleep in the same bed.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.217
Have it on my desk tomorrow.

06:43.218 --> 06:46.823
Okay.

06:48.225 --> 06:51.160
Look, Jack, I know you think fixing NBC

06:51.195 --> 06:55.164
is just another negative
synergy dynamics matrix.

06:55.199 --> 06:56.565
I wish.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.863
Then I could just solve it
with a Schwarzfeld tesseract.

06:58.864 --> 07:01.587
No, this is the nadir of my career, Lemon.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.923
No room for advancement,
a boss who doesn't get it.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.926
Every day, I wish some other
company had bought NBC.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.095
Xerox, Alcoa, Paas.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.680
The Easter Egg company?

07:10.714 --> 07:11.681
They own their market.

07:11.715 --> 07:13.035
When was the last time you bought

07:13.036 --> 07:14.767
a non-Paas egg-dyeing kit?

07:14.802 --> 07:16.552
Try never.
Paas is the best.

07:16.586 --> 07:18.554
Their wire egg dipper
is tops in the industry

07:18.588 --> 07:20.606
with the thinnest egg loop
to reduce dye lines.

07:20.641 --> 07:21.974
Exactly.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.426
Only I don't work for Paas.
I work for Kabletown.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.896
But I have a plan
that will fix everything.

07:26.930 --> 07:28.448
Okay, here's the thing, Jack.

07:28.482 --> 07:31.818
Your plan isn't gonna work.
Your shows are terrible.

07:31.869 --> 07:34.787
I mean, have you seen
that new game show <i>Homonym?</i>

07:34.822 --> 07:37.824
Your next word is "meat."

07:37.875 --> 07:39.158
Boy.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.043
Like when two people run into each other.

07:41.078 --> 07:42.495
Sorry, it's the other one.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.831
- Your next word is "stare."
- Okay.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.499
The things you climb to get...

07:46.550 --> 07:47.884
No, no, it's the other one.

07:47.918 --> 07:49.838
It's always the other one.
Let me see the card.

07:49.839 --> 07:51.287
No! Never!

07:51.305 --> 07:53.005
- Your shows stink, Jack.
- Really?

07:53.056 --> 07:54.223
So you don't peacock them?

07:54.258 --> 07:56.092
I don't... think so.

07:56.126 --> 07:57.643
But look, I get it.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.038
The clock's ticking, and you
feel like time's running out.

08:00.039 --> 08:01.564
It's like me and everything.

08:01.598 --> 08:03.015
How long is this show gonna last?

08:03.066 --> 08:04.400
How many eggs do I have left?

08:04.434 --> 08:06.635
Will I ever finish reading
<i>the corrections?</i>

08:06.653 --> 08:08.938
But you can't let that panic
get into your head.

08:08.972 --> 08:10.612
Well, thank you for your feedback, Lemon,

08:10.613 --> 08:12.773
but I'm not panicking,
I know exactly what I'm doing,

08:12.774 --> 08:14.911
so good peacock to you.

08:14.945 --> 08:19.615
- But, Jack...
- I said good peacock.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.503
Mr. Jordan.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.505
I mentioned your
dinner party idea to Hazel.

08:25.539 --> 08:26.956
Yes.

08:26.990 --> 08:31.127
And I thought we'd have a little
<i>fete Chez nous ce soir.</i>

08:31.161 --> 08:33.280
How nice to meet a woman
who speaks the language

08:33.282 --> 08:35.847
of the Nazis'
most enthusiastic collaborators.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.466
What a kind invitation.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.719
I do enjoy seeing
the homes of poor whites.

08:39.770 --> 08:40.770
What should I bring?

08:40.804 --> 08:43.389
Just bring your fascinating self.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.760
Kenneth tells me that you started

08:44.761 --> 08:46.442
your own movie studio this summer.

08:46.476 --> 08:49.228
Yes. I'm sort of
the black Tyler Perry.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.519
And I'm an aspiring actress

08:50.520 --> 08:51.840
whose most recent credits include

08:51.848 --> 08:54.150
running onstage during <i>Sister act.</i>

08:54.184 --> 08:55.735
This is wonderful.

08:55.786 --> 08:58.204
Tracy Jordan is coming to dinner.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.239
Just like in that episode
of <i>Family matters</i>

09:00.290 --> 09:02.375
when Tracy Jordan came to dinner.

09:02.409 --> 09:05.127
You know I wasn't scripted
to be in that episode.

09:05.162 --> 09:09.365
I just wandered onto set because
Reginald Veljohnson owed me $40.

09:11.168 --> 09:13.336
I'm thinking about Vegas
for the bachelorette party.

09:13.370 --> 09:14.703
We can't stay at the Palms.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.055
One of the Maloofs wants me dead,

09:16.059 --> 09:17.139
and the other one loves me.

09:17.174 --> 09:18.454
I don't remember which is which.

09:18.455 --> 09:19.842
Okay, great.

09:19.876 --> 09:21.143
Tracy, I need your advice.

09:21.178 --> 09:22.261
You like to throw parties.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.146
Why is everyone asking me for advice?

09:24.181 --> 09:25.848
I'm Tracy Jordan.

09:25.882 --> 09:28.050
Father of 3, married 22 years.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.152
I run my own business.

09:30.187 --> 09:33.656
My God.
I'm the most stable adult here.

09:33.690 --> 09:35.908
God, I don't want to be
Jenna's maid of honor.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.559
She wants her "something borrowed"

09:37.578 --> 09:39.445
to be Jessica Biel's youth.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.447
I don't know how to get that.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.498
If you don't want to do this,
you should tank it.

09:43.532 --> 09:45.652
That's what I do when
I want to get out of something

09:45.653 --> 09:47.493
like a schedule,
a parent-teacher conference,

09:47.494 --> 09:49.121
or this boring conversation.

09:49.172 --> 09:50.289
Tank it?
Wow, no.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.674
That's not "how I roll."

09:51.708 --> 09:53.588
Thank you for saying that
in dated urban slang

09:53.589 --> 09:55.177
so that I'll understand you.

09:55.212 --> 09:56.429
Word.

09:56.463 --> 09:59.015
And I would certainly never tank
on my friend Jenna.

09:59.049 --> 10:00.383
Because you're terrified of her,

10:00.402 --> 10:02.602
the way most white ladies are
with their best friends?

10:02.636 --> 10:04.437
That is racist, and only part true.

10:04.471 --> 10:07.857
A good person doesn't
intentionally do a bad job.

10:07.891 --> 10:09.525
I mean, look at Jack.

10:09.559 --> 10:11.119
He's in this terrible position at work,

10:11.120 --> 10:12.440
he wishes he were somewhere else.

10:12.441 --> 10:13.195
Is he tanking it?

10:13.230 --> 10:16.265
No. In fact,
he's trying even harder.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.619
Tonight on NBC, Joe Rogan is <i>Mandela.</i>

10:19.653 --> 10:22.405
And if it's Wednesday, it must
be cricket night in America.

10:22.439 --> 10:25.658
Then on Jay, a full hour
of Gary Sinise's band.

10:25.709 --> 10:30.162
My God.
Jack's tanking NBC!

10:33.820 --> 10:36.120
Turn your round.
God cop scene 24.

10:36.134 --> 10:37.568
I know what you're doing, Jack.

10:37.602 --> 10:39.737
You are purposely tanking the network.

10:39.771 --> 10:40.851
Good God, Lemon, what is it

10:40.852 --> 10:42.772
with you liberals
and your conspiracy theories?

10:42.774 --> 10:43.941
I've got bad news for you.

10:43.975 --> 10:46.293
The CIA did not invent crack cocaine,

10:46.328 --> 10:48.245
the Levees blew themselves up
in New Orleans,

10:48.280 --> 10:51.265
and no one is trying to destroy NBC.

10:51.299 --> 10:53.250
Hang on, did you cast yourself
in this show?

10:53.285 --> 10:54.251
What can I say?

10:54.286 --> 10:56.037
We saw hundreds of actors for God.

10:56.088 --> 10:58.448
Finally, the network executive
said I should just play it.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.757
You're the network executive.

10:59.791 --> 11:04.512
Could we have a moment, please?

11:04.546 --> 11:06.514
Fine.
You got me.

11:06.548 --> 11:09.467
I'm steering the <i>Titanic</i> into the iceberg.

11:09.491 --> 11:10.851
Why?
Are you trying to get fired?

11:10.886 --> 11:12.646
I'm trying to get Hank
to sell the network,

11:12.647 --> 11:14.087
and the only way to make him do that

11:14.088 --> 11:16.107
is to turn it into
a money-losing embarrassment.

11:16.141 --> 11:18.609
This explains everything.

11:18.643 --> 11:20.010
How long has this been going on?

11:20.028 --> 11:21.612
Seven years, eight?

11:21.646 --> 11:22.730
Six weeks.

11:22.781 --> 11:24.348
I have an investor lined up

11:24.366 --> 11:26.784
who'll buy the network
and keep me in charge.

11:26.818 --> 11:28.152
I can't tell you who it is,

11:28.186 --> 11:29.370
but his word is as good

11:29.375 --> 11:31.455
as the color consistency
on one of his Easter Eggs.

11:31.490 --> 11:32.523
Adolph Paas?

11:32.541 --> 11:34.959
This is wrong, Jack.

11:34.993 --> 11:37.745
Lemon, I cannot go to another
business school reunion

11:37.796 --> 11:40.998
and sit at the non-CEO table
with the...

11:41.032 --> 11:42.716
Women and nice men.

11:42.751 --> 11:45.071
You're right, Lemon, the clock
is ticking for both of us,

11:45.072 --> 11:47.588
but if I pull this off,
it's good for you too.

11:47.639 --> 11:50.874
You've never worked at a
properly-managed company before.

11:50.892 --> 11:52.176
That's true.

11:52.210 --> 11:54.250
Before this, I ran
an all-women's theater company.

11:54.251 --> 11:56.691
- Everyone was vice-president.
- Think of the job stability.

11:56.692 --> 12:00.217
Less stress, a commissary
that has taco Tuesdays again.

12:00.235 --> 12:03.270
After seven years,
you'll finally have a life.

12:03.321 --> 12:04.721
And what if your plan doesn't work?

12:04.722 --> 12:05.940
Of course, it's a risk,

12:05.991 --> 12:08.409
but sometimes your only choice
is to blow everything up

12:08.443 --> 12:11.195
and build something better
out of the rubble.

12:11.229 --> 12:13.948
Look at Sherman's march to the sea.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.617
Or what my good friend bane
tried to do to Gotham.

12:16.668 --> 12:17.701
Join me, Lemon.

12:17.735 --> 12:19.170
Help me tank NBC.

12:19.204 --> 12:22.957
Never. You're playing
with peoples' lives here.

12:23.008 --> 12:24.074
Who do you think you are?

12:24.092 --> 12:26.410
God, we're ready for you.

12:30.915 --> 12:34.351
If there is one thing
I have realized from being God,

12:34.386 --> 12:35.936
it's that the more you know,

12:35.971 --> 12:38.556
the more you realize you do not...

12:38.590 --> 12:39.557
Know.

12:39.591 --> 12:40.858
Why is he learning anything?

12:40.892 --> 12:42.726
He's supposed to be God.

12:45.530 --> 12:47.698
Now, don't embarrass me.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.438
Tracy!
Welcome to our home.

12:54.456 --> 12:55.823
Well, it's not technically a home,

12:55.874 --> 12:57.941
because no one's
supposed to be living here,

12:57.959 --> 13:01.412
but welcome to our condemned
site of the Candyman murders.

13:01.446 --> 13:04.465
Will you put this in the oven
at about 200 degrees?

13:04.499 --> 13:06.133
My snake should be very comfortable

13:06.168 --> 13:07.451
while she gives birth.

13:09.754 --> 13:14.141
Mr. Jordan, please help
yourself to some appetizers.

13:15.793 --> 13:19.096
Thank you.
Your home is terrible.

13:19.130 --> 13:21.131
Shall we conversation?

13:21.149 --> 13:23.234
- Yes. We're having weather.
- Much weather.

13:23.268 --> 13:25.802
So speaking of your movie studio...

13:25.820 --> 13:28.138
This conversation has a real flow to it.

13:28.156 --> 13:30.608
Do you ever have any roles for white women

13:30.642 --> 13:33.010
who've been described
by the <i>Hollywood reporter</i>

13:33.028 --> 13:36.847
as "some lady" who ruined
the premiere of <i>Paranorman?</i>

13:36.865 --> 13:39.516
I always have one white
person in all of my movies.

13:39.534 --> 13:40.784
We have to have a villain.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.620
And who's worse than us whites, right?

13:42.654 --> 13:46.123
I mean, look at slavery.
That was bananas.

13:47.993 --> 13:51.361
That sturgeon just will not die.

13:51.379 --> 13:54.298
Excuse me a moment.

13:54.332 --> 13:56.166
I also do accents.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.503
Me a cockney person.

13:59.537 --> 14:02.006
This is your Uncle Bob?

14:07.345 --> 14:09.730
Liz.
F.Y.I.

14:09.764 --> 14:11.815
Paul's family dog
is gonna be the ring bearer.

14:11.850 --> 14:15.185
Zoltan is an 18-year-old
German Shepherd who cannot walk.

14:15.219 --> 14:16.659
So you're gonna be in charge of him.

14:16.693 --> 14:17.973
No, Jenna, I'm allergic to dogs.

14:17.974 --> 14:18.889
Don't worry.

14:18.907 --> 14:21.358
He's hairless because
of his insanity medication.

14:21.392 --> 14:25.075
Also, since this is a surprise wedding,

14:25.076 --> 14:26.396
you're gonna want to carry around

14:26.397 --> 14:28.277
your bridesmaid's dress
with you at all times.

14:28.278 --> 14:31.068
Look how great this is
gonna look next to me.

14:31.086 --> 14:32.486
You know I can't wear green, Jenna.

14:32.487 --> 14:35.623
The clinique lady says
I have witch undertones.

14:35.674 --> 14:36.924
Liz, this isn't about you.

14:36.958 --> 14:39.009
Now, tonight, we have
a tasting with the caterer.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.444
It's gonna be molecular gastronomy.

14:40.445 --> 14:43.013
The cake is a tasteless foam.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.515
There's no cake?

14:44.549 --> 14:45.849
Tonight on NBC...

14:45.884 --> 14:47.051
<i>Tank it,</i>

14:47.085 --> 14:48.526
the reality event of the year

14:48.527 --> 14:50.087
where we make grandpas put on tank tops

14:50.105 --> 14:52.189
and then laugh at them.

14:52.223 --> 14:53.641
<i>Tank it.</i>

14:53.692 --> 14:56.527
You know what?
I can't do anything tonight.

14:56.561 --> 15:01.264
Because tonight is your surprise
bachelorette party!

15:01.283 --> 15:03.600
No way!
You planned it already?

15:03.618 --> 15:06.570
Sure. And you should
get your hopes way up.

15:06.604 --> 15:08.238
See you at my apartment
at 8:00.

15:08.272 --> 15:10.157
Your apartment?
Why?

15:10.208 --> 15:12.275
It's a surprise.

15:12.294 --> 15:14.828
And there's nothing worse
than a surprise Lemon party.

15:24.610 --> 15:26.543
Kenneth, darling,

15:26.583 --> 15:28.691
why don't you run out and get dessert?

15:28.697 --> 15:31.666
But we have government ice cream.

15:31.700 --> 15:34.202
And that's what you're
gonna serve to Tracy Jordan?

15:34.220 --> 15:36.137
I'm as shocked as anybody.

15:36.172 --> 15:38.757
Okay.

15:38.808 --> 15:40.168
Maybe the nice vending machine

15:40.169 --> 15:42.594
at the prison is working again.

15:45.881 --> 15:47.161
You're a real man, Tracy Jordan,

15:47.162 --> 15:48.316
playing it cool all night

15:48.351 --> 15:50.485
while I rubbed your foot under the table.

15:50.519 --> 15:51.987
My foot?

15:52.021 --> 15:54.072
No.
That's shoe stuffing.

15:54.106 --> 15:56.441
It helps keep the shape of my shoes.

15:56.492 --> 15:59.194
Why was you rubbing my foot anyway?

16:01.747 --> 16:03.031
Please.

16:03.065 --> 16:05.000
You know what's happening here.

16:05.034 --> 16:08.119
I never know what's happening anywhere.

16:09.872 --> 16:13.041
Okay, let's get this party started!

16:13.075 --> 16:16.928
I smell Italian guys.

16:18.580 --> 16:19.714
What is this?

16:19.748 --> 16:21.082
It's your bachelorette party.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.340
Bethany from work is here,
and a bunch of my neighbors,

16:23.341 --> 16:24.636
a clown.

16:24.687 --> 16:27.255
And there's a <i>God cop</i> marathon on NBC.

16:27.273 --> 16:28.440
I think Esposito lied to us.

16:28.474 --> 16:30.976
What do you mean "you think"?
You're God!

16:31.027 --> 16:32.811
I don't understand the rules of this.

16:32.862 --> 16:34.529
Let us pray.

16:34.563 --> 16:36.398
To whom?

16:36.432 --> 16:37.482
Before you say anything,

16:37.533 --> 16:39.484
I have one more surprise for you.

16:39.535 --> 16:42.404
Officer, we're ready!

16:42.438 --> 16:45.440
Thank God.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.909
Listen up, ladies.
You're all in a lot of trouble

16:47.943 --> 16:51.112
if you don't protect yourselves
against identity theft.

16:51.130 --> 16:53.281
Please take a pamphlet, pass them along.

16:53.299 --> 16:55.583
Okay, you're upset.

16:55.617 --> 16:56.835
But this is what you get

16:56.886 --> 16:59.054
when you choose Liz Lemon
as your maid of honor.

16:59.088 --> 17:00.839
So let's get this over with.

17:00.890 --> 17:03.791
I mean, what's the worst
you could possibly...

17:06.561 --> 17:08.930
Tracy, I will do anything

17:08.964 --> 17:11.849
to play a villain in one of your movies.

17:11.901 --> 17:13.601
The camera loves me.

17:13.635 --> 17:16.855
Especially when I flash my baby blues.

17:16.906 --> 17:18.638
Why are they blue?

17:18.657 --> 17:20.075
- Yeah.
- No.

17:20.108 --> 17:21.608
I'm married, Hazel.

17:21.643 --> 17:22.977
So am I.

17:22.994 --> 17:25.446
And if he ever wakes up
from that coma, I'm dead!

17:25.481 --> 17:27.815
That's why I live for today.

17:27.833 --> 17:30.785
You're just using Kenneth,
and I'm telling him everything!

17:30.819 --> 17:33.588
Whatever.
Go ahead and try.

17:33.622 --> 17:35.340
I'm gonna have to try?

17:35.374 --> 17:38.593
Worst night ever!

17:39.049 --> 17:41.329
Just ask one of your famous
friends to be maid of honor!

17:41.347 --> 17:43.598
Why do you think I asked you
in the first place?

17:43.632 --> 17:45.666
Because you're not famous!

17:45.685 --> 17:47.719
You think I want someone up there with me

17:47.734 --> 17:49.054
that other people are looking at?

17:49.105 --> 17:50.545
I wanted you because you're nothing!

17:51.640 --> 17:52.840
Yeah, I get it.

17:52.858 --> 17:54.418
You didn't want to get Pippa Middleton.

17:54.419 --> 17:56.811
Why would you even mention her?

17:59.014 --> 18:02.517
Who's gonna be my maid of honor now, Liz?

18:02.535 --> 18:03.568
Nobody.

18:03.619 --> 18:06.287
From the rubble, I will build.

18:06.322 --> 18:08.656
Are you talking about me
underneath your breath?

18:08.690 --> 18:10.024
Jenna, that's it.

18:10.042 --> 18:11.734
Nobody will be your maid of honor

18:11.735 --> 18:13.495
because there's only
one person who can be.

18:13.529 --> 18:14.695
You.

18:14.714 --> 18:17.165
- What? That's crazy.
- Think about it.

18:17.199 --> 18:19.167
There would be nobody
to steal your spotlight.

18:19.201 --> 18:22.754
In fact, you would have two spotlights.

18:22.805 --> 18:26.307
I think the maid of honor
should sing at my wedding.

18:26.342 --> 18:27.283
Sure.

18:27.284 --> 18:29.524
And she could do a fashion
show that takes the audience

18:29.525 --> 18:31.045
all the way through the wedding night.

18:31.063 --> 18:32.663
And what if she came in in a wheelchair,

18:32.664 --> 18:37.102
and then stood up, and everyone
applauded and cried?

18:37.153 --> 18:40.021
I know you doubted me, but now
you see my plan could work.

18:40.055 --> 18:42.824
So what do you say?

18:42.858 --> 18:44.225
Are you on board, Liz?

18:44.243 --> 18:45.660
You just called me Liz!

18:45.694 --> 18:47.294
We can fix that in the cutting room.

18:47.295 --> 18:48.696
Jonathan...

18:48.730 --> 18:50.865
Where's my car?

18:55.204 --> 18:59.841
Kenneth, I have something
I need to tell you.

18:59.875 --> 19:02.948
Last night when you left,
Hazel came on to me

19:02.949 --> 19:04.629
'cause she wants me to put her in a movie.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.747
Hazel, is this true?

19:06.766 --> 19:09.467
Yeah, it is true.

19:09.518 --> 19:10.585
Not!

19:10.603 --> 19:11.919
What I said was

19:11.937 --> 19:14.522
I would never sleep with Tracy
for a part in a movie.

19:14.557 --> 19:17.308
Please, you would love for
me to fall asleep on top of you.

19:17.359 --> 19:18.893
Come on, Kenmore washers and dryers,

19:18.928 --> 19:20.695
who you gonna believe here?

19:20.729 --> 19:23.264
- My best friend.
- Not really.

19:23.282 --> 19:25.766
- And my girlfriend.
- You wish.

19:25.785 --> 19:27.768
Well, I always believe you, sir,

19:27.787 --> 19:29.320
because you're on television.

19:29.371 --> 19:31.706
And webisodes.

19:31.740 --> 19:33.708
But yesterday you told me
our women are queens,

19:33.742 --> 19:34.942
and they're always right,

19:34.960 --> 19:38.213
which means I should believe Hazel.

19:38.247 --> 19:40.782
But that would make you wrong,
Mr. Jordan.

19:40.816 --> 19:43.418
And you've never been wrong
about anything before.

19:43.452 --> 19:45.253
It's a blessing and a purse.

19:45.287 --> 19:48.640
You can't both be right.

19:52.895 --> 19:55.230
Unless Hazel is always right.

19:55.264 --> 19:58.299
But only because you said so,
Mr. Jordan,

19:58.317 --> 20:01.603
which means you're right too.

20:01.637 --> 20:05.273
And both sides being right
is like kissing your sister.

20:05.307 --> 20:08.276
A wonderful treat!

20:09.778 --> 20:11.246
Bad move, Jordan.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.481
We'll see who's still
working here in six months.

20:13.499 --> 20:16.034
My hearing is bad because of firecrackers,

20:16.085 --> 20:19.037
but we'll see who's still
working here in six months.

20:19.088 --> 20:21.489
- That's what I just said.
- What?

20:21.507 --> 20:22.874
Okay, I get it.

20:22.925 --> 20:24.659
Sometimes tanking it is the only option.

20:24.677 --> 20:26.094
What did you do?

20:26.128 --> 20:29.597
Fake a sprained ankle to get
out of that breast health 5k?

20:29.632 --> 20:30.831
No, I did that.

20:30.850 --> 20:32.500
I forgot my sports bra, so ironically...

20:32.518 --> 20:33.801
It doesn't matter, Lemon.

20:33.835 --> 20:36.521
I'm just glad that you've seen the light.

20:36.555 --> 20:40.975
Now, help me tank NBC,
and you'll be helping yourself.

20:41.009 --> 20:42.227
You'll have it all.

20:42.278 --> 20:44.395
Jack, it's 9:30
in the morning.

20:44.446 --> 20:46.981
We're not trying to do
a good job here, Lemon.

20:47.015 --> 20:48.116
Now, what do you say?

20:48.150 --> 20:51.686
Are you in?

20:51.704 --> 20:53.621
Let's take this mother down.

21:00.658 --> 21:02.742
- Next word, "sent."
- I don't care.

21:02.780 --> 21:05.282
Okay, "cent" like a penny.
Whatever.

21:05.333 --> 21:06.733
No! Sorry, no.

21:06.751 --> 21:09.502
It's a homonym double down.

21:09.537 --> 21:10.754
Means you get to guess again.

21:10.788 --> 21:11.788
- "Sent."
- Okay, um...

21:11.839 --> 21:15.125
Then "scent" like a smell or an odor.

21:15.176 --> 21:17.010
No. It's the third one.

21:17.044 --> 21:18.578
Yourself!

21:18.596 --> 21:20.413
Next word is "au pere."

21:20.431 --> 21:21.965
What? There is only
one definition.

21:22.016 --> 21:23.583
It's like a nanny, a foreign nanny.

21:23.601 --> 21:24.751
No! You forgot.

21:24.769 --> 21:26.649
It could also be an exclamation
about a fruit,

21:26.650 --> 21:28.305
as in, "oh, pear!"

21:28.356 --> 21:30.190
What you are doing here is not right!

21:30.224 --> 21:32.525
I'm... I'm leaving.
