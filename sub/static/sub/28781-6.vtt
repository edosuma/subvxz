WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:04.910
<i>This is who she is now.</i>

00:05.080 --> 00:06.270
<i>No one in the history
of Krypton</i>

00:06.480 --> 00:09.230
has ever been able to withstand
Somatic Reconditioning.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.510
<i>Are you back inside my mind?</i>

00:10.680 --> 00:13.990
Very little of me remains
within you, but enough...

00:15.000 --> 00:15.950
When did you
get good at this?

00:16.160 --> 00:18.190
- To save you.
- <i>I need you to find the Codex</i>

00:18.360 --> 00:20.230
- <i>and then bring it to me.</i>
- <i>You know my terms.</i>

00:20.400 --> 00:21.620
- Complete surrender.
- That's it?

00:21.800 --> 00:22.670
That's your offer?

00:22.840 --> 00:24.710
<i>General Zod,</i>

00:24.880 --> 00:27.630
<i>you have one hour to begin
withdrawing from Wegthor.</i>

00:27.800 --> 00:29.470
<i>If you refuse, Lyta dies.</i>

00:30.000 --> 00:32.229
If you go through with this,
you do it alone.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.350
- I was afraid you'd say that.
- What are you doing?

00:34.520 --> 00:35.740
- Whatever it takes.
- <i>I'm picking up</i>

00:35.920 --> 00:37.390
<i>lots of warm bodies
behind there.</i>

00:37.560 --> 00:40.120
<i>Zod claimed he
was retreating, but instead,</i>

00:40.280 --> 00:42.150
he amassed his forces
underground,

00:42.320 --> 00:45.190
waiting to ambush us the moment
we returned Lyta-Zod.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.680
- <i>You have betrayed us...</i>
- No.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.790
<i>And for that,
you must be punished.</i>

00:48.960 --> 00:50.070
Jax, don't do it!

02:11.080 --> 02:13.720
Apologies, General,
but I have urgent news.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.720
Scouts in the Outlands have
pinpointed Doomsday's location.

02:17.880 --> 02:18.910
Headed toward
an ice cave system,

02:19.080 --> 02:19.950
south of Kandor.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.630
Have we regained control

02:22.520 --> 02:24.310
of our public broadcast
systems?

02:25.680 --> 02:27.390
I believe the rebels still
have control of it, sir.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.070
You mean to tell me that
all those people down there

02:30.240 --> 02:33.230
are still watching replays
of my mother's execution?

02:33.400 --> 02:36.110
I, um, don't know.
It's--it's possible, sir.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.600
I--really, I don't know.

02:42.040 --> 02:45.390
Then perhaps
you should find out.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.990
I know that what I did
was... unexpected,

03:28.600 --> 03:31.830
but, believe me,
it was for the best.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.270
We have the advantage now.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.030
General Zod has relocated

03:37.200 --> 03:39.070
all Sagitari units
to the mines,

03:39.280 --> 03:43.030
so for now, they are cut off
from all supplies,

03:43.240 --> 03:45.620
with no hope of reinforcements.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.590
Now,
we can make that permanent,

03:49.760 --> 03:53.030
once we take control
of the Space Elevator.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.710
Araame,
put a strike team together

03:54.920 --> 03:56.350
to round up
the Sagitari in the mines.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.390
Then we need to do recon
on the base station,

03:58.560 --> 04:00.030
see if there are
any Sagitari there.

04:00.920 --> 04:01.670
Stop!

04:04.600 --> 04:06.110
Do you realize
what you've just done?

04:06.280 --> 04:07.500
I did what I had to do.

04:07.720 --> 04:08.990
He gave me no choice.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.630
We were negotiating
an end to the war.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.310
You've cost us
any chance of peace.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.080
Zod failed to uphold
his side of the bargain

04:15.240 --> 04:18.110
by not removing
the Sagitari as agreed.

04:18.279 --> 04:20.430
This was never a negotiation.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.470
This was another one
of Zod's traps,

04:22.640 --> 04:24.990
which we evaded
because of my decision.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.830
But this act of barbarism--

04:27.640 --> 04:29.270
it goes against everything
we stand for.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.030
And you had it broadcast live

04:32.200 --> 04:33.630
to all of Krypton.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.190
Because of what I did,

04:35.360 --> 04:38.230
the people saw not only
his duplicity,

04:38.400 --> 04:39.590
but his weakness.

04:39.760 --> 04:42.510
They saw someone who--who
couldn't and wouldn't

04:42.680 --> 04:44.030
save his own mother,

04:44.560 --> 04:46.470
while in us
they saw determination.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.830
Hmm?

04:48.520 --> 04:50.430
An unwavering
commitment to the cause,

04:50.640 --> 04:52.870
because this is war.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.630
Do you want to win or not?

04:55.800 --> 04:59.070
Of course,
but this is not the way,

05:00.880 --> 05:05.070
Even if I could
put the moral issues aside...

05:06.400 --> 05:08.830
you made
a grave tactical error.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.750
We're not terrorists.
We're freedom fighters!

05:11.920 --> 05:15.030
People don't give a shit
what we call ourselves,

05:15.200 --> 05:17.270
and whatever they think now,

05:17.440 --> 05:19.110
they will thank us later
when we win.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.230
We won't win
without the people!

05:21.400 --> 05:22.230
We need them!

05:23.600 --> 05:26.240
We need them for shelter,
supplies, financing,

05:26.560 --> 05:28.270
intelligence, recruits.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.270
We are meant to be offering
them social reform,

05:31.440 --> 05:33.390
freedom from repression, hope.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.110
- Hope.
- Yeah, that's right.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.470
- Yeah.
- What you showed them

05:36.640 --> 05:38.950
was another tyrant
as morally corrupt as the one

05:39.120 --> 05:40.710
she is seeking to replace,

05:41.160 --> 05:43.870
and someone I am no longer
willing to support.

05:44.680 --> 05:48.190
So if this is your rebellion...

05:49.720 --> 05:51.750
I want no further part in it.

05:55.720 --> 06:00.740
All of you are here
because you chose to stand

06:00.960 --> 06:04.350
against this kind
of brutal tyranny.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.030
That's right.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.510
You now have
another choice to make.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.750
I'm with Val.

06:15.920 --> 06:21.390
I'm with Val!

06:48.320 --> 06:51.270
Yes?

06:51.440 --> 06:52.990
<i>I've done what you asked.</i>

06:53.720 --> 06:55.950
- Codex?
- On its way to Kandor

06:56.120 --> 06:57.310
with me.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.150
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

07:02.200 --> 07:04.390
I'm coming to get my son back.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.550
The Codex in exchange for Cor.
That was the deal.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.430
It was, but circumstances
have changed.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.150
You give me back my son,
or I'll destroy the Codex,

07:15.440 --> 07:16.710
<i>right now.</i>

07:18.680 --> 07:21.190
You would doom
our entire species...

07:22.480 --> 07:23.270
to extinction?

07:23.440 --> 07:24.870
<i>I will do whatever it takes</i>

07:25.040 --> 07:26.630
<i>to protect my family.</i>

07:31.760 --> 07:35.230
<i>Bring me the device.
I will honor the deal.</i>

07:35.800 --> 07:38.360
- You have my word.
- <i>Your word?</i>

07:38.880 --> 07:40.910
<i>Forgive me if I'm--</i>

07:56.800 --> 07:58.470
Rest up for now.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.510
I'll keep listening in
to the Sagitari comm signals

08:03.680 --> 08:05.110
to figure out
the best way off Kandor.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.500
And then what?

08:07.200 --> 08:08.910
I guess we head back
to the outpost.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.070
Figure it out from there.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.710
What about you?

08:18.960 --> 08:20.430
You gonna come with us?

08:21.360 --> 08:23.630
You were up there
for a while, right?

08:26.600 --> 08:27.590
On Wegthor.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.549
Tell me how something
like this can happen.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.940
Why don't you ask
your grandfather?

08:34.120 --> 08:35.309
My grandfather
would have tried

08:35.480 --> 08:36.620
everything he could
to stop it.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.230
It wasn't enough, was it?

08:38.400 --> 08:39.830
All I can tell you is that
Lyta wouldn't want

08:40.000 --> 08:42.380
the three of us
arguing about this.

08:42.559 --> 08:43.950
You're wrong.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.950
None of us would know
what Lyta wants.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.750
'Cause Zod Reconditioned her,

08:50.360 --> 08:51.990
changed who she was,

08:52.560 --> 08:53.750
her beliefs.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.720
Her memories.

08:57.560 --> 08:58.950
- Everything.
- That can't be true.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.230
- He wouldn't do that to her.
- I saw it!

09:01.400 --> 09:02.540
Look at me!

09:02.720 --> 09:03.940
I saw it!
I was there!

09:04.120 --> 09:06.110
I saw the Somatic
Reconditioning center.

09:06.280 --> 09:09.430
I saw exactly
what they did to her!

09:18.760 --> 09:20.430
And I think I know
exactly when it happened.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.060
I just didn't realize it
at the time.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.760
I should have known.
I failed her.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.510
Dev.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.990
Talk to us.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.550
What did you see?

09:39.840 --> 09:41.510
When you were away...

09:43.240 --> 09:44.990
everyone thought you were dead.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.590
It's what General Zod
told everyone.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.910
Lyta was devastated,
of course,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.590
and I was there for her,

09:52.560 --> 09:53.990
to support her.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.700
But over time we grew closer,

09:57.880 --> 09:59.790
closer than
we've ever been before,

10:00.200 --> 10:01.990
but then Lyta changed.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.430
I just put it down
to Zod's influence.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.710
He was growing stronger
politically

10:06.880 --> 10:08.710
and gaining power by the day.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.550
I remember the first moment
I knew

10:11.720 --> 10:12.910
Lyta was in love with you.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.230
I thought it would pass.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.390
What hope could there be
for a disgraced Rankless

10:20.560 --> 10:22.350
and the daughter of the Primus?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.430
But it didn't pass.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.750
- Not until you were gone.
- Dev.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.830
So when I saw
that same blind devotion...

10:33.680 --> 10:35.870
for Dru-Zod this time...

10:37.040 --> 10:38.310
I gave up on her.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.470
I should have known.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.560
I should have done something.
Instead, I...

10:48.360 --> 10:49.950
Instead, I gave up on her.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.030
I mourned the old Lyta
even before she died.

11:03.280 --> 11:07.430
<i>So much grief
over a single life.</i>

11:10.400 --> 11:12.510
You're expending
an inordinate amount of emotion

11:12.680 --> 11:14.150
over a solitary being,

11:14.360 --> 11:18.140
considering death is inevitable

11:18.360 --> 11:19.870
for all your species.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.940
A compromised capacity
for rational thinking

11:25.160 --> 11:28.190
is the direct corollary
of this indulgence.

11:28.880 --> 11:32.270
You can't possibly want
to feel this way.

11:35.920 --> 11:36.750
No.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.110
You must learn
to divest yourself

11:39.280 --> 11:41.470
- of such emotion if you--
- Stop!

11:50.600 --> 11:52.270
Stop blaming yourself.

11:53.440 --> 11:57.430
Lyta's death,
her Reconditioning.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.150
None of that is your fault.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.110
We need to move on.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.990
Need to push forward.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.750
Dev?
What is it?

12:11.920 --> 12:14.110
I'm hearing comm chatter.
Nyssa-Vex.

12:16.240 --> 12:19.870
She's en route from Wegthor,
arriving on planet imminently.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.630
General Zod sent
a Sagitari squad

12:21.840 --> 12:22.790
to the Base Station

12:22.960 --> 12:24.710
to retrieve
an important package from her.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.550
And Nyssa?

12:27.880 --> 12:28.790
What about Nyssa?

12:30.600 --> 12:32.710
She's been deemed
"Surplus to Requirements."

12:33.160 --> 12:34.830
Put them in a secure cell.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.630
You think that he saw?

12:45.600 --> 12:46.310
Seg?

12:47.520 --> 12:49.830
I think
the whole of Krypton saw.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.030
Of one thing I'm certain
going forward.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.990
There will be no secrets.
I promise.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.350
I'm not going to pretend to be
the same kind of leader

13:01.520 --> 13:03.630
that Jax was.
The truth is,

13:03.840 --> 13:07.720
she's irreplaceable.
I don't have her tactical mind,

13:07.840 --> 13:10.590
I don't have her experience...

13:11.160 --> 13:13.350
but I have a belief that what
we are doing

13:13.560 --> 13:15.710
is right and just,

13:15.880 --> 13:18.750
and because of that,
I know that we can win this.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.790
- We have to.
- Yes!

13:27.800 --> 13:31.230
Dru, I am truly so very sorry
for what happened to Lyta.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.350
<i>Deliver Jax-Ur
to me immediately,</i>

13:33.520 --> 13:34.710
<i>or everyone on that moon--</i>

13:34.880 --> 13:37.190
<i>civilian, rebel,
or otherwise--will die.</i>

13:37.600 --> 13:38.920
You can't be serious.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.720
There are countless
innocent civilians on Wegthor.

13:41.920 --> 13:46.470
<i>By executing Lyta,
you silenced the only voice</i>

13:46.640 --> 13:48.830
<i>that can stay my hand.</i>

13:49.320 --> 13:51.990
You and I disagree
on a great many things,

13:52.640 --> 13:54.670
but I know you believe
what you're doing

13:54.840 --> 13:56.590
is for the good
of our people.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.750
I respect the value you place
on Kryptonian life.

13:59.920 --> 14:03.800
<i>I do not require
your respect, Val-El,</i>

14:04.560 --> 14:06.350
<i>just your obedience.</i>

14:07.960 --> 14:12.230
Jax-Ur has been removed
from her position of leadership

14:12.400 --> 14:14.430
and is now in custody.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.630
She will answer
for what she has done.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.510
<i>Perhaps you doubt
that I possess</i>

14:18.680 --> 14:21.670
<i>the capability for such
large-scale destruction.</i>

14:22.680 --> 14:25.430
<i>That would be
an unwise assumption.</i>

14:25.880 --> 14:26.910
No.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.350
- I don't doubt it.
- <i>Good.</i>

14:29.720 --> 14:31.110
<i>I expect confirmation
that Jax-Ur</i>

14:31.240 --> 14:33.270
<i>is on her way to Kandor
within the hour.</i>

14:42.040 --> 14:43.590
Just so we're
absolutely clear,

14:43.760 --> 14:46.270
you definitely have it
on you, yes?

14:47.040 --> 14:49.310
Just saying, you could make
things a whole lot easier--

14:49.480 --> 14:52.230
Nobody touches the Codex
till I see my son.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.380
I'd hate to get you in front
of the general only to discover

14:55.560 --> 14:57.790
that you hadn't been honest
with us, that's all.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.990
That would not be good,
would it, Sagitari?

15:00.160 --> 15:02.030
No, sir, not good at all.
Mm-mm.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.870
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.350
This way.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.800
Well, come on, then.
I thought you were in a hurry.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.500
Sagitari.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.070
Assuming she really does
have it,

15:18.360 --> 15:19.030
where do you suppose

15:19.200 --> 15:21.070
she has it tucked away
right now?

15:23.400 --> 15:25.190
Inside jacket pocket, maybe?

15:25.400 --> 15:27.590
Yes, sir, I think that's
a very likely place for it.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.870
Mm-hmm.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.190
Ooh.

15:38.320 --> 15:39.830
Ahh!

15:45.520 --> 15:48.950
I suppose you were half right
about the inside jacket pocket.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.550
Stop!

15:55.680 --> 15:57.390
- Shit!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.550
I can't believe it.

16:01.720 --> 16:02.550
I don't understand.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.310
What are you doing here?

16:18.520 --> 16:21.080
Lyta's death did precisely

16:21.240 --> 16:22.510
what Jax expected:

16:23.040 --> 16:24.710
provoked an emotional response
from Zod.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.030
But instead of...

16:26.720 --> 16:29.180
being careless
and acting mistakenly,

16:29.600 --> 16:31.830
it stoked his desire
for revenge.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.030
So we've been given
two options:

16:35.360 --> 16:38.310
turn Jax over or deny Zod,

16:38.480 --> 16:41.550
and have him ravage everything
and everyone on Wegthor.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.100
Then please, just...

16:45.320 --> 16:47.110
just turn her over.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.990
And stop the killing.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.750
Look, I have seen
more than I care to.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.710
I've done more than I care to,

16:53.360 --> 16:54.990
and it has to stop.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.310
Do you really think that Zod

16:57.480 --> 16:58.990
is just gonna stop the killing

16:59.200 --> 17:01.630
- once he gets Jax?
- I don't know.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.310
Okay, listen.
I know this asshole.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.069
He is not gonna stop

17:06.240 --> 17:08.109
until he kills
every last one of us,

17:08.280 --> 17:09.710
one way or another.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.589
Of that, there is no doubt,

17:12.319 --> 17:14.030
which is why I feel
we have no choice

17:14.760 --> 17:17.109
- but to turn Jax-Ur over to Zod.
- Mm-hmm.

17:17.280 --> 17:18.790
We need to buy ourselves
some time,

17:19.119 --> 17:20.910
stop him
from retaliating immediately.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.270
You're making
the right decision.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.590
We don't want to stick
around here too long.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.830
The Sagitari failed to deliver
their package.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.230
- Zod's gonna send more.
- Their package?

17:39.440 --> 17:41.470
They were never gonna take me
to Zod, were they?

17:42.160 --> 17:43.710
What do you have
that he wants so badly?

17:44.120 --> 17:45.190
Nyssa?

17:45.560 --> 17:47.710
Nyssa.
What is it?

17:49.760 --> 17:53.070
I agreed to trade the Codex
to Zod in exchange for Cor.

17:53.520 --> 17:54.950
That was the deal.

17:55.120 --> 17:58.030
Before you say anything,
let me explain.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.550
Val put a failsafe
in the Codex.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.230
If anyone tries
to weaponize it,

18:04.400 --> 18:07.110
the Codex
will automatically shut down.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.190
Your grandfather knew
why I needed it.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.590
He did it to help us
so our son could be safe.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.670
Dru would never
have let you go,

18:18.880 --> 18:22.030
and once he'd found out
you'd corrupted the Codex,

18:22.240 --> 18:24.230
he would have killed you
without hesitation.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.460
I'm sure you're right.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.550
But that's not
going to stop me,

18:38.360 --> 18:41.230
because if there is even
the slightest chance

18:41.400 --> 18:45.030
that it could work,
I have to try...

18:46.360 --> 18:50.060
for Cor,
like you would have for Lyta.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.830
Then we have to find
some other way

18:58.000 --> 18:59.220
to get your son back.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.590
We can't let you walk
into House Zod alone.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.790
That is exactly
what we're going to do.

19:06.440 --> 19:07.630
Dev's right.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.120
Dru will quickly find out
the Sagitari

19:09.280 --> 19:10.500
he sent to collect you are dead.

19:10.680 --> 19:11.820
He'll be thinking
you're on the run.

19:12.040 --> 19:12.950
The last thing
they'll be expecting

19:13.120 --> 19:14.340
is for you to turn up there.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.840
Because it would be
suicide, Seg.

19:16.000 --> 19:16.950
You're not
thinking clearly.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.440
Do not patronize me.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.920
I just watched the woman I love
die in front of my eyes,

19:22.080 --> 19:23.510
like I watched my parents die,

19:23.720 --> 19:25.590
and there was nothing
I could do to save them,

19:26.120 --> 19:28.030
but I promise you,
there is nothing I would not do

19:28.200 --> 19:29.830
to keep my son safe.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.990
- Do you trust me?
- Of course I do.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.390
Then trust that I refuse
to let any more harm

19:35.560 --> 19:36.990
come to the people I love.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.110
I know.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.950
We should get moving.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.590
We'll go over the details
on the way.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.910
General,
we weren't expecting you.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.870
I need a progress report
on this weapon.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.670
Of course.
Our team has made

19:59.880 --> 20:01.710
significant strides
since we last spoke,

20:01.880 --> 20:04.440
and the results are promising,
if not yet conclusive.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.710
Am I to be encouraged
by that non-answer?

20:07.920 --> 20:11.700
Apologies, General.
Let me be more specific.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.230
The hardware components
are complete,

20:14.440 --> 20:16.790
fitted with both long-
and short-range firing options.

20:16.960 --> 20:20.270
The warhead housing the payload
is a high-density projectile,

20:20.440 --> 20:22.670
with Stellarium-powered
delivery system,

20:22.840 --> 20:25.990
allowing
for unprecedented impact depth.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.070
Simply put, General,
this weapon could pierce

20:29.240 --> 20:31.430
an underground bunker
cased entirely

20:31.600 --> 20:34.510
in high-grade Promethium--
theoretically.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.630
We'll know soon enough.

20:37.560 --> 20:39.110
The Codex is on its way.

20:40.120 --> 20:41.550
You will have it imminently.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.350
The Codex
will finally allow us

20:43.520 --> 20:45.070
to put this theory
into practice.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.310
Good.

20:46.480 --> 20:49.040
I need this weapon
fully operational

20:49.200 --> 20:51.510
within an hour of its arrival.

20:52.800 --> 20:53.910
An hour?

20:56.160 --> 20:58.070
I trust
that won't be a problem?

20:59.440 --> 21:02.110
No, General,
that won't be a problem at all.

21:06.880 --> 21:10.270
I hadn't thought myself
capable of being surprised,

21:10.440 --> 21:12.710
let alone betrayed.
Twice.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.950
Val-El takes advantage
of your history together.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.070
He still treats you
like a pupil.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.110
Now the bastard's taken
your bionic eye.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.190
Val-El is the most brilliant
man I've ever known.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.640
He just didn't live
under the oppression

21:29.800 --> 21:32.310
of the Voice of Rao,
or Daron-Vex...

21:34.080 --> 21:35.590
like you and I did.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.990
I didn't start Black Zero
because I wanted to.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.270
I did it because I had to,
and I see the Resistance

21:53.440 --> 21:54.580
and everything I've done
in its name

21:54.760 --> 21:56.510
in exactly the same way.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.540
I do what needs
to be done,

22:00.000 --> 22:01.270
however ugly,

22:01.720 --> 22:04.870
not because I enjoy it,
because no one else will.

22:05.040 --> 22:08.230
If that means people see me
as a monster, then so be it.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.780
It never stopped me before,
and it won't stop me now.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.350
Me neither.

22:19.080 --> 22:21.110
But by killing Lyta...

22:22.360 --> 22:24.510
Haven't we backed ourselves
into a corner?

22:29.680 --> 22:31.750
I've got myself
out of corners before.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.830
Well, don't just stand there.

23:00.000 --> 23:00.830
Keep an eye out.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.750
Mine's busy.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.630
<i>A former lawmaker</i>

23:23.800 --> 23:26.230
killed two highly skilled,

23:26.400 --> 23:29.150
expertly trained Sagitari?

23:29.520 --> 23:32.950
Nyssa-Vex is to be presented
here to me--

23:33.120 --> 23:35.030
That won't be necessary.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.230
Leave.
Now.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.510
Where's my son?

23:42.000 --> 23:43.110
Safe.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.150
You may see him yourself...

23:48.640 --> 23:51.790
once you hand over the Codex.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.750
Cor first.

23:56.920 --> 23:59.750
You think
you're in a position

23:59.920 --> 24:01.630
to issue demands here?

24:01.800 --> 24:03.670
Yes, I do.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.550
The Codex has been locked
and programmed

24:06.720 --> 24:08.470
to respond
to my voice only.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.870
Any other attempt
to operate the Codex

24:11.040 --> 24:13.310
will cause instant destruction.

24:13.720 --> 24:14.940
You...

24:16.440 --> 24:17.950
continue to surprise.

24:18.120 --> 24:21.150
Because you continue
to underestimate.

24:21.800 --> 24:22.870
Indeed.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.000
By returning here
with the Codex,

24:28.160 --> 24:31.710
you have completed
a difficult assignment,

24:31.840 --> 24:33.630
despite significant odds,

24:34.120 --> 24:38.190
and in doing so you have done
something very few have done.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.310
You've impressed me.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.400
I'm not proud
of what I've done,

24:42.560 --> 24:43.700
but I did what I had to.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.270
Precisely.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.390
Which is why I have
a proposal for you.

24:50.960 --> 24:53.030
Work with me, Nyssa.

24:53.200 --> 24:56.670
The rebellion is on its knees.
It will soon come to an end--

24:56.840 --> 24:59.220
even sooner with your help--

24:59.680 --> 25:00.820
and in the aftermath,

25:01.000 --> 25:02.950
there would be
many great opportunities

25:03.120 --> 25:04.790
for someone
with your capabilities.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.800
Governor of one of Krypton's
colonies, perhaps.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.950
Krypton has no colonies.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.950
Not yet, but as we both know,

25:13.320 --> 25:16.190
that is just a matter of time.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.910
Cor.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.790
I've been patient enough.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.830
Unlock the Codex.

25:53.680 --> 25:54.950
Remove your hand.

25:55.400 --> 25:56.830
You don't want that lock
detecting stress

25:57.000 --> 25:59.070
in my vocal patterns, do you?

26:01.800 --> 26:02.750
And your guards.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.830
I find their presence
stressful, too.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.950
Access authorization code.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.990
Erkol, Urrikka,

26:23.360 --> 26:26.230
Xan, Zenium.

26:34.440 --> 26:37.790
I will need to
verify this for authenticity,

26:38.360 --> 26:39.870
but it appears...

26:40.520 --> 26:42.270
you have impressed me again.

26:45.040 --> 26:47.030
Once that's been verified,

26:47.400 --> 26:49.960
how can I really trust
that you'll allow me to leave?

26:50.120 --> 26:53.870
If we are to work together,
as I propose,

26:54.040 --> 26:56.070
you must learn to trust me.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.750
A leap of faith?

26:58.720 --> 27:01.470
Yes, I suppose.

27:06.480 --> 27:08.230
I figured as much.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.870
Guards!

27:30.200 --> 27:31.270
Give me that.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.230
Looks like Jax turned
her sub-dermal comm device

27:47.400 --> 27:48.310
into some kind of weapon.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.390
Yeah, I
got that. I meant

27:49.600 --> 27:50.790
"where do you think she went?"

27:52.080 --> 27:54.310
Sorry, Val.
More bad news.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.910
There's a whole bunch
of gravity bombs missing

27:59.080 --> 28:00.400
from the munitions depot.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.270
She probably rigged them
to cover her escape,

28:02.440 --> 28:03.710
and laid a minefield
for anyone trying to follow.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.390
No, she has something else
in mind,

28:06.560 --> 28:08.190
and I know exactly
where she's headed.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.470
- Get your weapons.
- I mean,

28:10.640 --> 28:13.020
what's a day on the moon
without being shot at?

28:13.920 --> 28:15.270
Oh...

28:21.880 --> 28:24.030
No Sagitari skimmers
on the radar yet.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.830
We might be deep enough
in the Outlands by now

28:27.000 --> 28:28.320
to have lost them.

28:28.480 --> 28:31.910
<i>Your assessment
is correct, Seg-El.</i>

28:32.080 --> 28:34.190
However, I'm afraid pursuit
is not the concern

28:34.360 --> 28:37.110
that requires
your immediate focus.

28:39.400 --> 28:40.350
Something's wrong.

28:41.480 --> 28:42.310
What do you mean?

28:43.400 --> 28:46.310
I don't know how much--

28:46.480 --> 28:49.190
Zod's plasma blasts have
damaged the operating system

28:49.360 --> 28:51.230
of this vessel.
It will lose power

28:51.400 --> 28:55.230
in precisely 17 seconds,
resulting in a fatal crash.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.310
- Seg, what's happening?
- A blaster fried the system.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.590
- What?
- There's nothing I can do.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.390
Well, of course there is.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.710
With my assistance.

29:03.880 --> 29:04.990
- Seg!
- Hold Cor tight

29:05.160 --> 29:06.190
- and brace yourself.
- What?

29:06.360 --> 29:08.150
Nyssa, please!
Do it now!

29:13.040 --> 29:14.710
We need
to manually redirect power

29:14.880 --> 29:17.440
from the
emergency life support systems.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.510
Like so.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.750
It's okay.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.790
I thought we were--

29:38.000 --> 29:40.030
Everything's okay now.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.700
I swear.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.070
One hour.

30:05.120 --> 30:05.830
You made it.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.350
Barely, but we're here.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.230
Let's get you all inside
and warmed up.

30:25.320 --> 30:27.030
Since I've been back,
I've spent a little bit of time

30:27.200 --> 30:29.990
with Jax and... well,
I'm just gonna say it:

30:30.160 --> 30:32.470
she likes me.
Like, really likes me.

30:32.680 --> 30:35.060
So I think I could probably
talk her around.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.910
I'm sure she does not
really like you.

30:39.480 --> 30:41.630
I'm afraid the Jax-Ur
that could be reasoned with

30:41.800 --> 30:43.230
just doesn't exist anymore.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.820
Oh, shh-shh!

30:52.000 --> 30:53.030
No!

31:05.880 --> 31:06.510
Val!

31:08.840 --> 31:10.470
I didn't want it
to come to this.

31:10.880 --> 31:11.990
Neither did I.

31:12.880 --> 31:16.230
I've tried so hard to keep you
from making the tough choices.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.910
I never wanted you
to have blood on your hands.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.310
Then please.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.550
Zod has given us
an ultimatum.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.430
He demands we hand you over,

31:52.600 --> 31:54.830
or everyone on the moon dies.

31:56.760 --> 31:59.830
You wanted to provoke him.
You've achieved your goal.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.320
Of course.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.790
Because
your unyielding morality means

32:04.960 --> 32:07.030
you've never had to make
any of the tough choices.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.350
It's always been on me,

32:09.840 --> 32:11.550
even though
you've benefitted from them.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.320
No more.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.470
Activate this,
and the gravity bombs

32:17.640 --> 32:18.670
we've laid will destroy

32:18.840 --> 32:20.030
the Space Elevator
Base Station,

32:21.160 --> 32:24.430
cutting off Zod's forces
from fresh supplies

32:24.600 --> 32:26.150
and reinforcements.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.670
No, no, no, no, no.
You said that we were going

32:30.880 --> 32:32.550
to take control
of the Space Elevator,

32:32.760 --> 32:34.590
- not destroy it!
- Control it for how long?

32:35.040 --> 32:36.750
Have you found
those missing Sagitari yet?

32:36.920 --> 32:37.830
Hmm?

32:38.400 --> 32:40.230
How long before they try
to regain control of it?

32:40.680 --> 32:43.320
We don't have the numbers
to defend our base

32:43.520 --> 32:45.030
and hold the Base Station.

32:45.320 --> 32:47.430
Val, please.

32:47.800 --> 32:50.630
Hundreds of innocent civilians
that work that station--

32:50.800 --> 32:53.360
that don't believe
in Zod's war--they will die.

32:53.520 --> 32:54.840
Please!

33:01.160 --> 33:02.670
So what's it going to be,
my friend?

33:03.440 --> 33:05.510
Are you prepared to sacrifice
the lives of a few

33:05.680 --> 33:08.030
to save the entire planet?

33:28.960 --> 33:33.030
You know that Lyta and I...
we never really saw eye to eye.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.870
But I respected
your daughter,

33:44.080 --> 33:46.790
and if I had any idea

33:47.000 --> 33:49.430
that Jax was planning on doing
what she did...

33:51.360 --> 33:52.790
I would have found
a way to stop it.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.190
I swear.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.350
You feel guilty.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.020
We all do.
Maybe we all failed Lyta.

34:08.159 --> 34:10.429
Or...

34:12.159 --> 34:13.830
maybe she could never
have been saved.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.510
We'll never know,

34:20.760 --> 34:22.710
but we can
make her death count.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.550
We have to.

34:25.159 --> 34:27.870
If Val hasn't already, then
we can bring Jax to justice.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.429
She will answer
for Lyta's death.

34:31.080 --> 34:35.350
But right now, we need to focus
on stopping Dru-Zod.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.630
We cannot let him
spread more misery

34:37.840 --> 34:39.429
and destruction
across the universe.

34:42.120 --> 34:45.670
I say tonight
we rest, but tomorrow

34:46.960 --> 34:48.550
we make Dru-Zod pay.

34:50.440 --> 34:52.070
And what about...

34:53.040 --> 34:54.550
the next day?

34:58.960 --> 35:01.190
And the day after that?

35:04.440 --> 35:06.510
Whatever we do...

35:07.800 --> 35:09.950
won't bring Lyta back.

35:30.320 --> 35:34.150
<i>I trust this call means
Jax-Ur is on her way.</i>

35:34.360 --> 35:35.630
<i>Because of
your sound judgment,</i>

35:35.800 --> 35:38.070
<i>I will show mercy.
Of course,</i>

35:38.280 --> 35:41.710
I cannot allow your comrades
to escape punishment,

35:42.280 --> 35:44.590
but you, Val-El, will have
the honor of returning

35:44.760 --> 35:47.510
to the Science Guild
and working for me.

35:47.960 --> 35:49.430
There is nothing
more dangerous

35:49.600 --> 35:51.190
than a delusional dictator,

35:52.160 --> 35:54.350
<i>and you must be living
inside a fantasy</i>

35:54.520 --> 35:55.950
if you believe
I will ever support

35:56.120 --> 35:57.070
your foul vision.

35:58.720 --> 36:02.830
Choose your next words
carefully, old man.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.830
There are no more words.

36:06.600 --> 36:07.630
<i>What is that?</i>

36:28.600 --> 36:29.710
<i>What now?</i>

36:30.600 --> 36:33.630
<i>We wouldn't be here
today if it wasn't for you.</i>

36:33.800 --> 36:36.750
<i>All of Krypton owes you
a debt of gratitude,</i>

36:37.880 --> 36:40.070
<i>but you can't be a part
of this rebellion,</i>

36:40.240 --> 36:41.830
<i>not anymore.</i>

36:42.920 --> 36:45.790
<i>So go, Jax.
Disappear,</i>

36:45.920 --> 36:50.550
<i>and perhaps you may just
find yourself again one day.</i>

36:59.800 --> 37:01.350
Tell me it's ready.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.550
We can really only
regard this as a prototype.

37:03.720 --> 37:05.590
Just give it to me.

37:13.120 --> 37:13.790
Hmm...

37:17.280 --> 37:18.910
General, there's something
you need to know.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.380
The Codex was corrupted.
Some kind of failsafe

37:22.560 --> 37:24.470
was installed to protect it
from being weaponized

37:24.640 --> 37:28.230
in the most, shall we say,
obvious or expected manner.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.350
Mm.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.470
Val-El, no doubt.

37:32.200 --> 37:34.580
How does that impact
our intended use?

37:34.760 --> 37:36.550
We believe we managed
to retrieve

37:36.720 --> 37:38.750
the genetic information
we needed,

37:39.240 --> 37:41.590
but there's no way
to be certain without tests.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.870
Then I will test it
in the field.

38:17.720 --> 38:20.390
Where do we go
from here, Dev?

38:23.520 --> 38:25.190
I don't know.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.390
But wherever we go,
we go together.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.550
Tears.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.550
I'd say of frustration,

39:33.120 --> 39:34.630
not sadness.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.270
Fear of the fight
that lies ahead.

39:41.760 --> 39:43.950
Very rational, actually.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.830
It demonstrates
a marked improvement

39:47.000 --> 39:48.910
in your capacity
for critical thinking.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.590
Perhaps aware now

39:50.760 --> 39:53.630
that you cannot defeat
your son,

39:54.000 --> 39:58.310
the finest military mind
Krypton has ever known.

39:58.480 --> 39:59.620
You're wrong.

40:01.560 --> 40:04.470
We will defeat him.
We have to.

40:06.680 --> 40:08.230
You will not.

40:09.600 --> 40:13.550
And though you attempt
to suppress this knowledge,

40:13.760 --> 40:16.350
you increasingly understand
this to be the truth.

40:22.760 --> 40:23.830
Yes.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.350
Unless...

40:30.720 --> 40:33.280
- Unless you help me?
- Precisely.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.310
Take me to my ship,

40:38.480 --> 40:40.430
my quantum consciousness,

40:41.160 --> 40:43.230
and I will imbue you

40:43.400 --> 40:45.590
with the power
to defeat General Zod.

40:45.760 --> 40:47.950
And then what?
And then what?

40:48.760 --> 40:50.950
You just leave Krypton
for good, Brainiac?

40:51.120 --> 40:53.150
It's lies.
It's all lies.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.590
You're trying to manipulate me.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.390
I give you my word.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.310
We need to leave.
Now.

42:04.080 --> 42:05.510
What about Jayna and Dev?

42:06.800 --> 42:08.510
It's best they don't know.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.590
What's going on with you?

42:17.560 --> 42:19.830
It has to do with what happened
in the skimmer.

42:22.240 --> 42:25.590
The reason I was able to solve
that problem...

42:28.760 --> 42:30.310
It's because of Brainiac.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.030
He's alive...

42:34.920 --> 42:35.910
in me.

42:40.040 --> 42:42.150
I can't tell you
more than that right now,

42:42.520 --> 42:44.950
but I need you
to help me end this.

42:45.400 --> 42:47.110
You're the only one
that I can trust.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.230
I meant what I said.

43:04.800 --> 43:08.870
I will never, ever let
anything happen to you or Cor.
