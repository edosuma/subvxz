for answering a question

10:02.736 --> 10:04.836

Yes, another argument
for too much training.

So, back to my favorite
question --

10:14.748 --> 10:16.414
What do I think?

10:16.416 --> 10:21.686
Well, this Clark Farman
is no ordinary low-rent PI.

This is a big-time fixer
whose firm rakes in millions.

10:25.892 --> 10:29.394
Now any non-disclosure agreement
that would scare him

10:29.396 --> 10:31.963
must come from a seriously
rich client.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.099
-Hey, guys.
-Who died?
