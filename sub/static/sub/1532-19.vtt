00:02.160 --> 00:03.161
Previously on Arrow:

00:03.320 --> 00:04.890
You have but two choices.

00:05.080 --> 00:09.961
Ascend to the calling of Ra's al Ghul, or you
will spend the rest of your days in a cage.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.889
- I love you.
- Wow.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.401
- Lance knows.
- The whole city knows, Oliver.

00:14.600 --> 00:17.763
Mr. Queen should be considered armed
and highly dangerous.

00:18.640 --> 00:19.801
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:19.960 --> 00:21.485
Captain Lance.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.170
I'm here to turn myself in.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.368
- The hell are your people doing?
- I told them to stand down.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.642
- Get down.
- You've got the wrong guy.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.211
Oliver Queen isn't the Arrow.

00:32.439 --> 00:34.010
I am.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.760
To repeat, we're getting word
from the authorities...

00:41.960 --> 00:46.807
...that Roy Harper, a Glades resident with a
long history of run-ins with the police...

00:47.000 --> 00:50.891
...has been identified as the vigilante
known as the Arrow.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.129
What the hell was that?

00:54.960 --> 00:56.291
Probably just a power surge.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.923
That wasn't a power surge. Check it out.

01:40.800 --> 01:45.124
Harper is currently being transported
to S. C. P.D. by police caravan...

01:45.320 --> 01:47.527
...and should be arriving eminently.

01:47.720 --> 01:50.883
We're now going live to the S. C.P.D.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.290
All right, let's get him. Come on.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.287
- Bring him.
- Captain.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.767
- You calling off the hunt for Queen?
- No comment.

01:57.960 --> 01:59.450
Come on, bring him through.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.367
Proud of yourself?
Letting the kid take the fall?

02:17.560 --> 02:21.007
Not gonna let him do that. Give me a pen
and paper, I'll sign a confession.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.641
Oliver? Not another word.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.047
- Uncuff him.
- Ha. Sure, in 25 to life.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.446
More like right now.

02:27.640 --> 02:28.801
Habeas writ.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.884
The district attorney's office
won't charge Oliver Queen...

02:32.080 --> 02:34.447
- ...while charging Harper with the crime.
- Nice try.

02:34.640 --> 02:37.246
Five hours ago,
Queen turned himself in. He confessed.

02:37.440 --> 02:41.331
To you, alone and uncorroborated.
And then the Arrow turned himself in.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.930
Your so-called confession
is looking rather fabricated now.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.761
- That's just crap.
- The DA is ordering Oliver to be released.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.850
You the only one who's allowed
to put themselves above the law?

02:58.200 --> 02:59.281
This isn't over.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.809
What the hell are you doing?

03:07.960 --> 03:10.406
Making sure you both
don't end up in prison.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.601
Hey. What are you doing here?

03:25.800 --> 03:27.643
Proofing the quarterly earnings report.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.241
Finalizing the subsonic
ionizer patent application.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.802
- And I'm trying to debug a sequential...
- I mean what are you doing here? Heh.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.968
Oliver and Roy Harper
are both in handcuffs.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.242
I have a lot of work to do.

03:40.440 --> 03:43.569
And Oliver was released.
How do you know about Roy Harper?

03:43.760 --> 03:45.967
Apart from it being
all over the television...

03:46.200 --> 03:49.090
...I'm able to put one and one
together and I get that...

03:49.280 --> 03:52.124
...Oliver's sister's boyfriend
is obviously part of your team.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.367
Obviously.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.642
- You okay?
- Yes.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.247
How are you?

03:59.640 --> 04:02.211
Yeah, let's not get into that. Uh...

04:03.920 --> 04:06.400
I said I love you, but it was like...

04:06.640 --> 04:09.405
It was, like, with a lower case L.
You know? Not...

04:10.120 --> 04:13.124
Um... So let's not make it a thing.
Um...

04:13.640 --> 04:17.361
You had just saved my life,
I had 6.2 billion nano-robots...

04:17.560 --> 04:21.166
...coursing through my hypothalamus,
and my emotions were all over the place.

04:23.600 --> 04:29.130
Well, I'll let you get back
to your work-slash-worry, and, uh...

04:31.160 --> 04:32.764
...keep a good thought for Roy.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.286
Okay.

04:51.480 --> 04:52.845
What were you thinking?

04:53.040 --> 04:54.644
Roy?

04:57.040 --> 04:58.610
Tell me why.

05:01.560 --> 05:04.404
Remember what I told you
when I found out you were the Arrow?

05:04.600 --> 05:06.921
Yeah, you told me I saved your life.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.650
Now I get to save yours.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.844
- I can't let you do that.
- Oliver, ever since I found out...

05:12.080 --> 05:16.210
...that I killed that cop, I have been
trying to make it right as Arsenal.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.891
Maybe what I need to do
is make it right as the Arrow.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.162
- No, Roy...
- I killed a police officer.

05:22.360 --> 05:26.251
Mirakuru or not, I should be punished
for that. I should be in prison.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.568
That won't bring the officer back.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.962
This city still needs you.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.886
It needs you more.

05:33.880 --> 05:37.327
For the first time
since I remembered what I did...

05:38.840 --> 05:40.444
...I'm okay.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.405
You sure this place is safe?

05:51.240 --> 05:54.084
- As safe as I could manage.
- Who's that?

05:54.920 --> 05:57.651
- Someone eager to repay a debt.
- For how long?

05:57.800 --> 05:59.962
Waller has men all over Hong Kong
looking for us.

06:00.120 --> 06:03.602
Even if we make it out, there's nowhere
we could run where Waller won't find us.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.767
So, what are we gonna do?

06:08.920 --> 06:12.606
- I'm gonna find Waller first.
- You'll break into A.R.G.U.S. by yourself?

06:12.800 --> 06:14.325
No.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.047
He's gonna walk in.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.281
My pass card to the field office.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.007
What do you want?

06:33.200 --> 06:35.931
Setting Harper up as your patsy.
I applaud the gambit.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.721
I had nothing to do with Roy
turning himself in.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.406
- But I will get him out.
- And then what?

06:42.600 --> 06:46.002
Ra's won't stop until you're wearing
the Demon's Head ring on your hand.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.646
- That's not gonna happen.
- People are being murdered.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.121
Your days as the Arrow are finished.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.800
But of course,
no one close to you has died.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.200
Have you considered leading
the League of Assassins...

06:57.400 --> 07:01.166
...might be a preferable outcome
as to what alternatives Ra's might devise?

07:01.360 --> 07:03.283
I have a lot of work to do.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.841
I'm gonna break Roy out of prison.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.091
Ironically, before turning
to vigilantism...

07:10.320 --> 07:14.291
...Harper was a career criminal with an
arrest record for breaking and entering...

07:14.480 --> 07:16.767
...petty theft, and grand larceny.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.407
- Recently, Harper worked in collaboration...
- Thea.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.126
- Tell me you didn't put him up to this.
- Of course not.

07:23.320 --> 07:26.290
But I'm gonna do everything
in my power to make it right.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.450
- You okay?
- I'm fine, but we need Roy out of prison.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.849
Looks like we have another problem
to add to our ever growing list.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.088
Homicide at Starling National Bank.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.443
Channel 52 has acquired
surveillance footage of the incident.

07:38.680 --> 07:41.604
If you're a bank-robbing metahuman,
why stay in Central City...

07:41.800 --> 07:44.690
...when you have banks and no Arrow?
Okay.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.406
Okay, we need a plan to extract Roy.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.967
In the meantime, Felicity,
call S.T.A.R. Labs.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.925
See if they're tracking any metahumans
out of Central City.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.887
S.C.P.D. According to city records,
you got a basement down here.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.202
You already have Roy Harper in custody.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.846
I got a warrant that says
I can search that basement.

08:02.680 --> 08:03.727
Sorry for the rush.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.367
I didn't wanna give you time to turn
that place into a storage room again.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.289
Gentlemen.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.770
Here you go. Break it down.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.331
I got you now, you son of a bitch.

08:58.040 --> 09:02.648
Oh, uh, my Chinese is a little rusty, but this
looks like a crate from the North China Sea.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.724
You spent some time there, right?
And this is my favorite.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.491
You actually put those things on display?

09:08.640 --> 09:12.929
Captain, we have fingerprint matches for the
latents we lifted off all this equipment.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.610
Hold that thought.

09:15.640 --> 09:16.971
What do you got?

09:17.120 --> 09:18.929
We only got one match.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.810
- Who is it?
- Roy Harper.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.964
What, just one...?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.286
Uh...

09:25.440 --> 09:27.602
Did you check the other computers?

09:27.800 --> 09:29.370
- Captain, it's clearly...
- Shut up.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.451
Whatever crap
you're thinking about giving me, save it.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.970
Smart as you all are,
you are bound to make a mistake.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.004
I'm gonna be there when it happens.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.086
You wiped the entire place.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.448
And moved some of your
sensitive trunk items.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.847
- You're welcome.
- You didn't wipe Roy's prints.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.685
Roy confessed.
We didn't see any point losing both of you.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.285
I'm not losing Roy.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.165
What about that metahuman
that's out there killing people?

10:04.360 --> 10:06.522
We need my backup cache
from the secondary lair.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.925
See those plainclothes?
Lance will have them follow you.

10:10.120 --> 10:13.203
You try to nab even so much as
a purse-snatcher and they'll pounce.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.209
Somebody needs to protect this city.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.444
We are dealing with a metahuman.
Call Barry.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.210
Oh, he can't help right now. Uh-uh.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.006
He's got a lot on his plate
with Dr. Wells, I think.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.646
It's really hard to keep up with him.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.969
But what if there's someone else
that could help?

10:31.880 --> 10:33.689
Oh, hey, Felicity. Check this out.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.723
I finally got the neural network online.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.367
So when my brain
tells the gauntlet to wave, and...

10:39.960 --> 10:41.405
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.928
Sorry about what's happening.
If there's anything I can do to help...

10:45.160 --> 10:46.525
That's why we're here.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.365
- Oh.
- You know how I try to keep my work life...

10:49.560 --> 10:52.643
...and my other work life separate?
I meant to tell you that.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.006
Did I tell you that?

10:54.200 --> 10:55.565
- There's a...
- There's a meta...

10:55.720 --> 10:57.563
...in Starling City killing people.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.322
- A meta, as in human?
- Yeah.

11:01.840 --> 11:05.811
So obviously we need to catch
this plasma death thing guy.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.611
Ugh. Now I see why Cisco
gives them all names.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.083
The police are all over Oliver,
so we need you.

11:12.240 --> 11:13.924
And you're okay with this?

11:15.080 --> 11:16.491
We need your help.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.491
So it's a team-up.

11:18.680 --> 11:19.727
High-five.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.600
- Don't shoot.
- What the hell is going on?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.083
They've been holding me here for weeks.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.642
What? You don't trust me?

11:52.720 --> 11:53.960
Look at him.

11:54.120 --> 11:57.442
- He's Army, not A.R.G.U.S.
- You're saying this is General Shrieve?

11:57.640 --> 12:00.007
He held me hostage.

12:00.200 --> 12:03.124
Targeted you and the Yamashiros
for death.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.607
- Why would he do that?
- The Alpha/Omega.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.408
Shrieve plans to unleash it
on Hong Kong.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.491
Claim that the Triad mishandled a
bioweapon they never should've had.

12:13.640 --> 12:16.564
- That's insane.
- Well, Shrieve seems to think that...

12:16.760 --> 12:20.321
...China is a military and economic threat.

12:20.560 --> 12:24.849
So he'd killed himself and his men
just to hurt China?

12:25.040 --> 12:29.045
His team has developed a vaccine
they can inoculate themselves with.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.962
Run. Get as far away
from Hong Kong as you can.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.844
If you make it...

12:39.760 --> 12:41.489
...I hope we meet again someday.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.484
Now go.

12:50.560 --> 12:53.848
- Who's the Arrow now, boy, huh?
- There he is.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.841
Can't hide now, can you?

12:58.680 --> 13:01.684
- I see you. I see you.
- Hey, baby.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.169
How are you?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.889
I told the guards I didn't wanna see you.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.529
Why?

13:34.400 --> 13:35.811
Roy, please.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.202
Will you tell me what is going on?

13:43.160 --> 13:44.685
When we got back together...

13:44.920 --> 13:47.366
Hell, even before that. l...

13:48.680 --> 13:51.684
I made a promise to myself
that I would never lie to you again.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.085
Okay.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.766
That's why I didn't wanna see you.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.049
I didn't wanna break that promise.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.771
Why would you?

14:05.360 --> 14:06.600
- Roy.
- Thea.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.688
Thea, please just...

14:11.760 --> 14:14.286
...know that I'm gonna be fine.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.648
Is that a lie?

14:36.720 --> 14:37.926
Thea, don't worry.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.771
Roy's not gonna be in there much longer.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.202
I'm working on it. Bye.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.965
- Roy holding up?
- For now.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.565
Hot off the presses.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.489
What are those?

14:49.680 --> 14:52.251
I visited the bank today.
Ah, manager's a friend of mine.

14:52.440 --> 14:55.887
I beat him at squash every Tuesday.
I took a few photos of the crime scene.

14:56.120 --> 14:59.169
Photos is a bit reductive,
these are enhanced resonance scans.

14:59.320 --> 15:02.642
It occurred to me that if we can't
see his face because of radiation...

15:02.800 --> 15:05.087
...we need to remove the radiation.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.725
Oh, I could kiss you right now.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.486
Awkward, sorry. Boundaries.
Working on it.

15:10.920 --> 15:15.244
So if we interlace the resonance scans'
frequency with our news footage,

15:15.400 --> 15:16.447
we get this.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.284
- There he is.
- Facial recognition?

15:18.440 --> 15:20.169
Way ahead of you.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.805
Jake Simmons, he's in the system. Serial
bank robber. Explains Starling National.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.810
Last known address, Central City.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.161
Where's he now?

15:29.360 --> 15:33.445
He was last seen on a traffic camera
at the corner of Gantner and Yount.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.689
There's a processing plant there.
He went in, never came out.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.047
- On it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

15:39.240 --> 15:43.040
I thought the point of this team-up was
you not being spotted out as a vigilante.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.685
Stop calling it a team-up, Ray.

15:44.880 --> 15:49.249
This Jake Simmons is not just a metahuman, he
is a killer and you're not ready for that.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.841
I'm not gonna try to
equate our experiences...

15:52.040 --> 15:56.523
...but superpowers are based in science,
and I am a man of science.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.689
If there's any way to defeat this guy...

15:58.880 --> 16:01.884
...I'm the one best able to figure it out.
Fine.

16:03.360 --> 16:06.967
- The second you get in over your head...
- I'll run.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.891
Fly. Probably.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.167
How many abandoned warehouses
are in this city?

16:24.360 --> 16:27.250
- No, no, I'm genuinely curious.
- Stay focused, Ray.

16:27.400 --> 16:31.086
- Maybe Simmons isn't in there.
- You get this anxious when I'm in the field?

16:31.800 --> 16:34.724
I can't think of an answer
that doesn't get me in trouble.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.447
Still nothing.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.525
Not a visual sighting or any reading
at all from the Atom.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.610
When I say Atom, I mean the suit,
not myself in third person.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.246
There's a decent chance
you and Palmer are related.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.927
Well, that's equally fascinating
and terrifying.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.450
Be my eyes, Ray. What's going on?

17:02.520 --> 17:05.603
Oh, Tin Man. You shouldn't be here.

17:05.839 --> 17:06.965
Actually, I should.

17:07.119 --> 17:10.407
See, you're the bad guy, and I...

17:11.800 --> 17:13.131
Ray?

17:18.319 --> 17:20.402
Thanks for the top-off.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.211
Ray?

17:45.160 --> 17:47.811
Ray? Ray?

17:54.440 --> 17:56.841
Oh, my God, Ray. Are you hurt?

17:57.040 --> 18:00.283
Hurt would be a step or two up
from how I feel right now.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.721
Wait, just a second.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.641
You're lucky to have
gotten out of there alive.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.446
It wasn't that bad, was it?

18:08.800 --> 18:10.529
- It was way worse, Ray.
- Ray.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.128
- I need shields.
- That's not the answer.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.840
You need to anticipate your opponent.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.844
You need to trust your instincts,
and not just your tech.

18:19.040 --> 18:22.681
- My instinct is to trust my tech.
- When I'm on the field, my bow, my arrows...

18:22.920 --> 18:25.241
...those are just tools.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.209
- I'm the weapon.
- That's poetic.

18:27.440 --> 18:33.083
My point is that if you rely on that suit
more than you rely on yourself...

18:33.520 --> 18:34.885
...it's gonna get you killed.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.530
- When will Shrieve distribute the virus?
- Don't know.

18:47.080 --> 18:52.007
If he's gonna pin it on the Triad, he'll have
to do it soon. We need to get out of Hong Kong.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.528
My contacts say
Shrieve has men everywhere.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.724
Even more resources
at his disposal than Waller ever had.

18:57.960 --> 19:00.361
Shrieve has ensured
we won't get off this island.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.403
Alive.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.250
Well, if we can't run...

19:08.400 --> 19:11.847
- Waller said Shrieve had a vaccine.
- You wanna steal some?

19:12.080 --> 19:14.003
He has to have it
somewhere in Hong Kong.

19:40.760 --> 19:41.807
Get down!

19:45.440 --> 19:47.920
Let's see how good you are
without your arrows.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.446
Good enough.

20:14.520 --> 20:15.646
Just remember...

20:15.840 --> 20:18.047
...that was without arrows.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.811
Get down on the floor!

20:29.440 --> 20:31.169
Turn this place inside out.

20:31.320 --> 20:34.449
We know how this guy
loves his secret hiding places.

20:34.640 --> 20:38.167
Hey, Frank. What brings you out
of your downtown office?

20:38.320 --> 20:40.641
Chief of D has asked me
to have a word with you.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.002
Yeah? What about?

20:43.560 --> 20:45.927
He wants to know why
you're going Ahab on Queen...

20:46.080 --> 20:48.003
...when we got a different suspect
in custody.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.004
We got a patsy in custody, trust me.
Queen is our guy.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.685
There's no evidence against him.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.850
- Why do you think I'm searching his condo?
- Friend to friend...

20:56.000 --> 20:58.367
...you've come so far. You're a captain.

20:59.160 --> 21:02.607
Don't throw all your hard work away
on something personal.

21:10.480 --> 21:14.690
I don't know what it is you think
you're gonna find, but it's not here.

21:14.840 --> 21:15.841
There's nothing here.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.008
Like there was nothing
in the basement of your club?

21:18.160 --> 21:20.845
You're either complicit
or the most naive girl I ever met.

21:21.040 --> 21:25.204
You know that your brother is letting your
boyfriend rot in prison for his crimes, right?

21:25.920 --> 21:28.002
Get out of my home.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.128
I know you went to visit Harper
yesterday.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.162
Does he even know why
he's throwing his life away?

21:39.240 --> 21:40.401
Lance.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.006
Is he all right?

21:44.680 --> 21:46.682
All right, I'll be right there.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.564
Your boyfriend was just attacked.

21:50.720 --> 21:51.926
He's all right.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.851
But I can't imagine it'll be the last time.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.403
Your brother dropped a lot of bodies.

21:57.560 --> 22:02.202
And when... Not if. When... Roy gets a shiv
in the back, that body will be on him too.

22:07.720 --> 22:11.361
The suit recorded over 10 terabytes of
data, which were uploaded in real time...

22:11.600 --> 22:14.410
...to a geosynchronous satellite.
That is a huge energy suck.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.604
- Fascinating. How do we find Simmons?
- Light bulb. Literally.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.451
No, actually, figuratively, ha.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.808
Just before Simmons beat me...

22:23.040 --> 22:25.088
...I blasted him with my
compressed light beams...

22:25.280 --> 22:27.442
...and he thanked me for topping him off.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.603
He absorbs energy,
turns it into weaponized plasma.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.968
If we can link into the
city's power grid...

22:32.240 --> 22:34.766
...we might track
where he's getting his extra juice.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.929
Ollie!

22:40.760 --> 22:42.603
- What's going on?
- It's Roy.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.962
He was attacked by a bunch of inmates.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.443
He's fine,
but there's hundreds of them in there.

22:53.280 --> 22:57.126
- I'm gonna break him out.
- You could end up in a cell next to him.

22:57.320 --> 23:00.130
If you know what's good for you,
you'll get out of my way.

23:00.320 --> 23:04.120
Oliver, if you know what's good for you
and for Roy, you're gonna stay put.

23:04.360 --> 23:05.521
- I can't do that.
- Listen.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.809
- Get your hands off me.
- Listen, I know what you're going through.

23:08.960 --> 23:12.487
You have to rely on Palmer to take care
of this meta while Roy sits in prison.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.610
But listen to me, man.
You have to throttle this back, Oliver.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.484
You have to.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.006
If we lose everything...

23:24.160 --> 23:26.322
I've already lost everything.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.806
I am not gonna lose Roy.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.362
- Oliver.
- I can't believe...

23:49.520 --> 23:53.844
...you and Diggle are sitting on your hands
while Roy fights off all of Iron Heights.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.209
- It's not that simple.
- No, Felicity, if anything was ever simple...

23:57.360 --> 23:59.647
...it's this.
This what? You going to jail too?

24:01.600 --> 24:03.329
I can't just do nothing.

24:03.520 --> 24:08.208
I think John's right. I think you're struggling
with doing nothing. With Roy, with Ray.

24:08.360 --> 24:13.161
But right now, you need people to help you.
You need to let them.

24:14.160 --> 24:18.210
Maybe there is something more going on
with you than just what's happening...

24:18.360 --> 24:19.885
...with Roy and this metahuman.

24:21.280 --> 24:25.046
You have sacrificed everything
to be the Arrow.

24:26.120 --> 24:28.202
Even you and me.

24:28.520 --> 24:29.885
But...

24:30.880 --> 24:36.330
...whether or not you break Roy out
of Iron Heights, there is no more Arrow.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.881
Ra's took that from you.

24:42.760 --> 24:47.766
I was told once that a man
cannot live by two names.

24:49.400 --> 24:53.200
Well, right now I can't live by either.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.562
So I don't know who I am.

24:57.840 --> 24:58.921
I know who you are.

24:59.400 --> 25:03.610
Whether you're in a suit or under a hood,
you're the man that I...

25:06.680 --> 25:09.843
You're the man that I believe in.

25:14.440 --> 25:17.762
Ray finished the transponder.
I have to upload it to a power source.

25:17.920 --> 25:20.082
Hopefully it'll bring us right to Simmons.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.287
I'll go with you.

25:21.440 --> 25:26.128
It is adorable how you keep forgetting that
Lance is after you, but it's a quick errand.

25:26.360 --> 25:30.126
And you need practice
in letting people help you.

25:43.080 --> 25:44.286
You sure this is it?

25:44.440 --> 25:46.807
It doesn't look like a typical Army base.

25:46.960 --> 25:50.043
Matthew Shrieve isn't a typical
Army general, apparently.

25:54.720 --> 25:55.846
Quiet.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.407
Where's the vaccine?

25:58.800 --> 26:02.725
You can end up unconscious
or you can end up dead.

26:03.920 --> 26:07.163
Two lefts, second door on your right.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.407
Good choice.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.128
Company coming, 10 seconds.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.685
Up there.

26:37.920 --> 26:38.967
Thank you.

26:39.120 --> 26:40.804
Can you give us a minute?

26:41.480 --> 26:45.166
- I already signed my confession.
- Yeah, it's a hell of a story.

26:45.360 --> 26:48.204
That stuff about setting up shop
under your girlfriend's club.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.641
I like how you manage
not to implicate her.

26:50.840 --> 26:55.129
- What are you doing here?
- Remember that, uh, corpse I showed you?

26:55.320 --> 26:58.722
The one the Arrow killed? I knew you had
an obsession with the Arrow...

26:58.960 --> 27:01.850
...and I was trying to wave you off,
because I knew somehow...

27:02.040 --> 27:05.886
...that if you stayed obsessed with him,
that you would come to a bad end.

27:11.920 --> 27:15.561
And here I am, two years later.
I'm still trying to save you, son.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.210
I don't need saving.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.602
You're doing this
because you think you owe Queen.

27:19.760 --> 27:23.481
- But you don't. You don't deserve to be here.
- Patrol Officer Gabe Vincent.

27:23.680 --> 27:26.684
He left behind a wife and 9-year-old boy.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.087
I know.

27:29.720 --> 27:31.484
I killed him.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.528
I stabbed him in the chest with an arrow.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.724
So don't think for a second
that I don't deserve to be here.

27:38.240 --> 27:41.164
No. You don't think for a second
that what you're doing here...

27:41.360 --> 27:43.362
...makes up for anything you did
out there.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.090
Guard.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.929
Perfect.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.447
We have takeoff.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.888
I'm sorry, miss, but I don't think
you're supposed to be here.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.526
I'm supposed to access your grid
for the city.

28:26.760 --> 28:28.285
Think you can help?

28:29.080 --> 28:32.129
- Sure. It's this way.
- Thank you.

28:32.880 --> 28:36.282
So, uh, what's with the sunglasses, man?

28:36.560 --> 28:38.210
We're indoors and it's, well, night.

28:38.440 --> 28:41.205
- Do you have a sensitivity to...
- To light?

28:41.440 --> 28:42.805
No.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.723
I love the light.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.169
Think the plan to find Simmons
will work?

28:58.360 --> 29:00.362
Well, it was Felicity's, so yes.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.971
Except the tracking firmware
seems to be malfunctioning.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.685
- What?
- It's not a malfunction.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.685
It's Simmons.
He's drawing energy from a power station.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.763
- Which one?
- The one Felicity just went to.

29:12.520 --> 29:13.681
Come on, Felicity, pick up.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.844
I'm sorry, but the blond
can't come to the phone at the moment.

29:17.080 --> 29:19.686
- I swear to God, if you hurt her...
- You'll what?

29:19.880 --> 29:22.167
Fly away again?

29:22.360 --> 29:25.603
I am talking to the man in the suit, right?

29:25.800 --> 29:31.409
The one who thinks a piece of scrap metal
makes him some kind of hero?

29:31.640 --> 29:33.210
It doesn't.

29:33.400 --> 29:36.210
I am sorry for the interruption.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.811
Where were we?

29:38.040 --> 29:40.042
Waiting for you to come closer.

29:48.680 --> 29:50.170
- You can't go.
- It's Felicity.

29:50.360 --> 29:54.729
You won't make it in time. The power station
is 8 minutes away going 60 on your Ducati.

29:54.880 --> 29:58.043
- But the Atom can fly.
- You need more than your tech this time.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.890
You're right.

30:00.120 --> 30:03.567
My tech needs your instinct,
and maybe there's a way we can get it.

30:08.560 --> 30:11.882
Okay, I'm entering the
power station now. Activate the link.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.563
Ha, ha. It's working.

30:17.720 --> 30:20.246
I'm just a passenger now. Oh!

30:20.400 --> 30:21.447
Let's get this guy.

30:31.880 --> 30:33.245
Sorry...

30:33.440 --> 30:37.240
...but I have to kill you now.
- No, you're gonna leave her the hell alone.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.127
Kick his ass.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.127
You Okay?

30:44.760 --> 30:47.889
- You gotta get out of here.
- No. I'm not gonna leave you here alone.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.407
- Get her out.
- I'm not alone, but I can't fight him...

30:50.560 --> 30:52.050
...and worry about you. Go.
No.

30:52.280 --> 30:54.601
Felicity, go! Get out of here!

30:55.760 --> 30:58.604
- Hope you played video games as a kid.
- I'm trying to concentrate.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.569
Sorry. Just, I'm trusting you with my...

31:10.280 --> 31:12.726
Ray, can you take this beating?
I can pull you back.

31:12.920 --> 31:14.809
I'm fine, just get this bastard.

31:24.440 --> 31:25.646
Ray, I've lost control.

31:26.440 --> 31:27.851
My transmitter's been severed.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.971
Get up.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.287
Get up, Ray!

31:39.840 --> 31:41.649
Fight back, Ray. Fight back!

31:42.000 --> 31:44.241
- Ray!
- He's too strong.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.169
This is not about strength.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.481
This is about heart.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.163
When the mayor was killed,
you put yourself at risk to save Felicity.

31:51.320 --> 31:54.642
Normal people, they don't do that.
Heroes do that.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.007
Come on, Ray.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.161
Take him out, Ray.

32:19.840 --> 32:21.365
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

32:21.520 --> 32:23.010
No, it's totally worth it.

32:23.200 --> 32:26.170
Are you okay? I was so worried.

32:26.360 --> 32:29.807
I'm fine. Even/thing's okay now.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.882
Eyes front, Harper.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.891
I told you, eyes front.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.811
My instincts are to swivel my head.
Won't happen again.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.571
No, it won't.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.250
Thea?

33:27.720 --> 33:29.210
It's Roy.

33:31.480 --> 33:32.891
Harper was killed an hour ago.

33:39.440 --> 33:43.081
I'd say I'm sorry, but I think
we both know whose fault this is.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.731
I shouldn't have listened to either of you.

34:26.840 --> 34:29.922
I might not have been able to save Roy...

34:33.280 --> 34:37.409
- ...but I'd feel better right now if I'd tried.
- We know that, Oliver.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.603
We also know you may never forgive us.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.127
I make my own choices, John.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.161
I made this one.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.328
He doesn't mean forgive us for that.

34:48.719 --> 34:52.007
He means forgive us for this.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.207
How?

35:02.400 --> 35:04.607
Don't be mad at them, this was my idea.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.129
If any one of us were in there,
Oliver would think of something.

35:08.320 --> 35:09.481
You're right.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.968
If one of us deserves to go to prison...

35:18.160 --> 35:20.527
...it's me.
Roy, we can't allow you to do that.

35:20.800 --> 35:24.043
- No way Oliver's going along with it.
- That's why you won't tell him.

35:26.120 --> 35:29.329
You could have gotten yourself
killed for real.

35:29.560 --> 35:33.167
I figured that I could hold off
until Dig's guys got into position.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.207
One of Lyla's contacts,
an A.R.G.U.S. freelancer.

35:38.040 --> 35:41.249
He has a special talent
for knifing people in just the right way.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.046
Leaves a convincing amount of blood
without the kill.

35:44.360 --> 35:47.842
He laces the blade with a beta blocker
to crawl the heartbeat.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.366
Gives the illusion of death.

35:50.080 --> 35:51.889
Everyone thinks the Arrow is dead.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.560
Which means Oliver Queen is innocent.

35:55.880 --> 35:58.247
You did all this without asking?

35:58.480 --> 36:01.529
How many times
have you saved one of us without asking?

36:02.240 --> 36:03.844
This time, we had to save you.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.360
If everyone thinks you're dead...

36:10.600 --> 36:12.250
...then what happens to Roy Harper?

36:18.400 --> 36:22.246
Tell Thea... Well, tell her
I'm alive first, heh.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.641
Then tell her I'm sorry
I had to leave without saying goodbye.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.484
- I feel like you're throwing your life away.
- I'm not.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.565
I'm starting a new one.

36:33.520 --> 36:34.851
Anywhere, anytime...

36:35.920 --> 36:37.365
...you need something, call me.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.445
Take care of yourself, Roy.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.529
I'll miss you most of all, Scarecrow.

36:49.880 --> 36:51.723
Just be ready to get a million calls...

36:51.920 --> 36:54.730
...on that untraceable satellite phone
I stashed in your bag.

37:03.040 --> 37:04.087
Thank you.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.606
Thank you.

37:27.760 --> 37:32.766
So on a scale of one to 10,
how mad at us are you?

37:34.040 --> 37:35.849
I need to learn to let people help me.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.525
Yeah.

37:38.680 --> 37:41.047
You could use some practice in that.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.288
I just think sometimes
you're so focused on people you love...

37:46.480 --> 37:50.326
...you forget to see
that there are people who love you.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.005
Just enough inoculant for us.

38:31.800 --> 38:32.847
And Akio.

38:33.880 --> 38:36.884
- What about her?
- We need to inject Akio and ourselves.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.566
Then the three of you
need to get somewhere safe.

38:39.720 --> 38:42.371
- And what about you?
- I lifted this when I took the vaccine.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.602
It belongs to one of Shrieve's men...

38:44.840 --> 38:47.650
...because it has plans for how
they'll distribute the virus.

38:47.880 --> 38:49.769
I'm gonna use it to stop them.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.923
No, you won't.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.160
- We are.
- Tatsu.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.368
What example are we setting
for our son...

38:56.600 --> 39:00.321
...if we have a hope to save millions
of innocent people but only save ourselves?

39:00.560 --> 39:04.451
Listen, the two of you need to take care of
Akio. I am not gonna be responsible...

39:04.680 --> 39:07.001
You need to learn to let people help you.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.763
And Maseo and I are going to.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.929
What about...

39:18.640 --> 39:20.563
- ...Death bolt?
- Nice.

39:22.720 --> 39:26.247
You know, you're the only other person
who's good at the names.

39:26.800 --> 39:29.883
So, uh, how do they get fed,
and you know...

39:30.080 --> 39:31.969
...complete the transaction, so to speak?

39:34.280 --> 39:35.770
Cisco?

39:37.040 --> 39:39.566
You said Simmons
was from Central City, right?

39:39.760 --> 39:43.731
Yeah, last known address,
4160 Dixie Canyon. Why?

39:44.120 --> 39:46.407
According to this,
Jake Simmons was a guest...

39:46.600 --> 39:49.763
...of the Opal City Police Department
on December 11, 2013.

39:49.960 --> 39:53.726
- Where do I know that date from?
- The date of the particle accelerator test.

39:53.920 --> 39:57.083
But if Simmons wasn't in Central City...

39:57.280 --> 40:00.329
...the night of the dark
matter explosion...

40:01.200 --> 40:03.407
...then how can he be a metahuman?

40:38.480 --> 40:40.050
Do you know who I am, child?

40:41.240 --> 40:42.685
You're the Demon.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.968
I am the Demon's Head.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.280
As those were before me.

40:48.480 --> 40:51.131
And very soon, your brother.

40:51.320 --> 40:53.049
He will never take your place.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.850
He Will.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.361
Once I've given him sufficient motivation.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.847
No, my brother's going to kill you.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.166
No.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.362
He's going to beg me.
