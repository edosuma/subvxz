WEBVTT

00:22.397 --> 00:23.482
‐ Whoa!

00:25.400 --> 00:27.945
Yeah!

00:28.320 --> 00:30.239
Woo‐hoo‐hoo!

00:32.991 --> 00:33.951
Whoo!

00:33.951 --> 00:36.745
And that's crowverine gliding.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.329
‐ No!

00:37.329 --> 00:39.456
This is crowverine gliding.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.249
Boost me!

00:45.087 --> 00:46.713
Yeah! Woo‐hoo!

00:46.713 --> 00:48.966
Crow big or crow home!

00:48.966 --> 00:50.676
Crow no! I'm losing my grip!

00:53.095 --> 00:53.971
‐ Hang on!

00:54.972 --> 00:56.557
‐ Oh, crow is me!

01:38.807 --> 01:39.975
‐ Gotcha!

01:39.975 --> 01:41.435
That was awesome!

01:41.435 --> 01:43.145
Nothing like a little Midnight Mayhem

01:43.145 --> 01:44.938
to make the thing in your chest thump.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.191
‐ Mine is thumping
like it wants to escape.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.358
‐ Nice!

01:48.358 --> 01:49.693
The thumpier the better.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.904
But we better get back
before everyone wakes up.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.620
Glide you later, crowverine.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.416
Guy‐Boy, where are you?

02:04.416 --> 02:05.167
‐ Right here.

02:05.751 --> 02:06.835
Sorry.

02:06.835 --> 02:07.794
Didn't mean to scare you.

02:07.794 --> 02:08.921
‐ How did you do that?

02:08.921 --> 02:11.757
‐ It's all smoke and mirrors!

02:11.757 --> 02:13.759
Literally. I used smoke and mirrors.

02:13.759 --> 02:16.512
‐ Nice! So no one knows
we left for Midnight Mayhem?

02:16.512 --> 02:18.096
‐ Have I ever let you down?

02:18.096 --> 02:20.432
When I cover for you, you're covered.

02:20.432 --> 02:21.308
Hop in.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.324
‐ Guy‐Boy, you've outdone yourself.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.534
‐ Aw, it's nothing.

02:38.534 --> 02:39.743
Just some wigs I made,

02:39.743 --> 02:41.119
some strategically‐placed food

02:41.119 --> 02:43.121
and a few dry runs
with Belt, Sash and Douglas.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.041
‐ Yeah, but what do you mean by,

02:46.041 --> 02:48.794
"There's no berry cakes for breakfast"?

02:48.794 --> 02:50.212
‐ Is that a real question?

02:51.588 --> 02:52.923
‐ Berry cakes for me, please.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.716
‐ Dawn, weren't you listening?

02:54.716 --> 02:57.261
There are no berry cakes
because they were stolen.

02:57.261 --> 03:01.139
‐ No, we heard because
we definitely didn't just get here.

03:04.601 --> 03:08.605
‐ Uh, but just in case someone else
wasn't listening, like Gran‐‐

03:08.605 --> 03:10.941
‐ Because we don't need men!

03:10.941 --> 03:13.193
Oh. I'm here. What's for breakfast?

03:13.193 --> 03:14.611
‐ Can we do a quick recap?

03:14.611 --> 03:16.738
‐ Sure. The punch monkeys
are stealing food

03:16.738 --> 03:18.782
from the kitchen, the fields, everywhere.

03:18.782 --> 03:19.908
And that's about it.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.744
‐ Eh, we needed to cut back
on food anyway.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.454
Eatin' makes you soft.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.789
Got a story to prove it.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.583
Many moons ago‐‐

03:27.583 --> 03:30.544
‐ Now isn't the time
for one of your long stories, Gran.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.671
Now is the time for vengeance

03:32.671 --> 03:36.258
against those insufferable,
fist‐wielding beasts!

03:36.258 --> 03:39.761
‐ Right. That's why
I'm gonna find 'em and grind 'em!

03:41.388 --> 03:42.306
Hey!

03:42.306 --> 03:45.851
‐ I'm afraid this task requires
a more sophisticated approach,

03:45.851 --> 03:47.436
free of simpleminded rhymes.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.896
Namely, my approach.

03:50.105 --> 03:50.814
Hey!

03:50.814 --> 03:52.733
‐ Why don't we just talk to them?

03:52.733 --> 03:56.278
‐ Talk? To simians who communicate
through pugilistic violence?

03:56.278 --> 03:57.738
An exercise in futility.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.199
Thankfully, I've got a better idea.

04:00.199 --> 04:03.744
I'll invent a brilliant trap
to catch the punch monkeys.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.871
‐ And I've got a better idea
than his idea.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.706
I'll catch them with my bare hands.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.833
‐ And I've got an even better idea.

04:09.833 --> 04:10.918
Use your words.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.836
Words solve more problems than violence.

04:12.836 --> 04:16.006
‐ First one to catch a punch monkey
gets to sleep in a bed.

04:16.006 --> 04:19.218
‐ You're always welcome to sleep in a bed,
but you're on.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.511
‐ Hate to not eat and run,

04:20.511 --> 04:23.138
but Dawn and I
have a big day ahead of us, right, Dawn?

04:23.138 --> 04:26.308
‐ Yep. A big, quiet,
not dangerous in any way day.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.851
Let's go!

04:32.981 --> 04:33.690
‐ Dawn!
‐ Gah!

04:34.066 --> 04:36.777
‐ Sorry. I know you got spooked
by that crowverine last night,

04:36.777 --> 04:37.611
and me just now,

04:37.611 --> 04:40.531
but I've got a great idea
for Midnight Mayhem.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.574
Two words, cave collapse.

04:42.574 --> 04:45.285
‐ Falling rocks, stale air, no light,

04:45.285 --> 04:47.037
tempting but I think I'll pass.

04:47.496 --> 04:48.872
‐ What about sand swimming?

04:48.872 --> 04:50.415
And by sand, I mean quicksand.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.876
And by swimming,
I mean trying not to sink.

04:52.876 --> 04:53.627
‐ Buried alive?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.379
Love it.

04:55.379 --> 04:56.713
But maybe another time?

04:56.713 --> 04:57.297
‐ You're right.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.507
Keep it simple.

04:58.507 --> 04:59.883
When's the last time
you were in a volcano?

04:59.883 --> 05:02.010
‐ I'm not really in a lava mood.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.428
‐ Okay. I hear you.

05:03.428 --> 05:07.224
You had a near miss
and you wanna e‐e‐ease back into action.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.475
I know just the thing.

05:09.893 --> 05:10.978
Branch bounce?

05:10.978 --> 05:12.980
‐ Yeah, it's easy. I'll go first.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.947
‐ You call that a branch bounce?

05:26.451 --> 05:27.744
‐ Uh‐oh.

05:27.744 --> 05:28.829
Gran, are you okay?

05:29.830 --> 05:33.750
‐ Eh, if your joints ain't crackin',
you must be slackin'.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.419
‐ Okay, Dawn, your turn.

05:36.253 --> 05:37.045
‐ Great.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.091
Because I wasn't hoping
you'd forget about me.

05:41.675 --> 05:42.634
Here I go.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.728
Yes. Branch bounce.

05:52.728 --> 05:54.897
So much fun.

05:54.897 --> 05:57.357
‐ What's wrong
with other girl who lives here?

05:57.357 --> 05:59.443
‐ Uh, Dawn had a close call last night.

05:59.443 --> 06:00.611
‐ It's no big deal.

06:00.611 --> 06:03.280
I almost went splat
for the very last time.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.072
That's all.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.283
‐ Huh. Lost your grrr, huh?

06:06.283 --> 06:07.618
‐ "Grrr"? What's that?

06:07.618 --> 06:09.578
‐ You ever had a fire in your belly?

06:09.578 --> 06:10.329
‐ Sure.

06:10.329 --> 06:11.788
One time I ate some lava peppers‐‐

06:11.788 --> 06:13.207
‐ Not that kind of fire.

06:13.207 --> 06:16.251
I'm talkin' about a fire
that never stops burnin'.

06:16.251 --> 06:19.796
A fire that keeps you goin'
when you wanna quit.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.715
But not a fire.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.342
That's grrr!

06:23.342 --> 06:24.301
Get it?

06:24.301 --> 06:26.094
‐ So grrr is courage?

06:26.094 --> 06:27.137
‐ Exactly.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.181
Many moons ago,

06:29.181 --> 06:34.102
a close friend of mine named, uh, uh‐‐

06:34.102 --> 06:35.562
Who remembers names?

06:35.562 --> 06:38.232
Anyway, she lost her grrr.

06:38.232 --> 06:41.860
So she climbed to the top of Grrr Mountain

06:41.860 --> 06:43.737
to get her grrr back!

06:43.737 --> 06:44.613
The end.

06:45.447 --> 06:46.615
‐ That's it? Wow.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.742
That's a lot shorter
than your usual stories.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.786
‐ Uh, yeah, it is, isn't it?

06:50.786 --> 06:53.664
‐ But it has everything we need
to get Dawn's grrr back.

06:53.664 --> 06:54.373
‐ It does?

06:54.373 --> 06:54.998
‐ Yeah!

06:54.998 --> 06:57.626
All we have to do
is climb to the top of Grrr Mountain

06:57.626 --> 06:59.670
and, boom, you've got grrr.

06:59.670 --> 07:00.504
Thanks, Gran.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.048
‐ It was nice knowing you, Gran.

07:03.966 --> 07:07.177
‐ Feel like I'm forgetting
an important part of that story.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.513
Eh, I'm sure it doesn't matter.

07:11.223 --> 07:13.475
‐ This is your idea
to catch punch monkeys?

07:13.475 --> 07:15.310
Papaynapple juice?

07:15.310 --> 07:16.728
I know they love papaynapple but‐‐

07:16.728 --> 07:18.856
‐ No, that's merely the bait.

07:18.856 --> 07:22.067
When those furry‐faced filchers,
thirsty from thievery,

07:22.067 --> 07:24.736
reach for this cup of papaynapple juice,

07:24.736 --> 07:26.822
it will trigger
an elaborate network of vines

07:26.822 --> 07:28.156
that will sweep them into the trees,

07:28.156 --> 07:30.742
immobilizing them, paw and foot,
in vine cuffs.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.287
‐ Pfft, punch monkeys won't fall for this.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.830
‐ Of course they will.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.207
They're almost as mindless as you.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.458
Now watch and weep.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.924
‐ Hey, uh, what are you guys doing?

07:45.924 --> 07:48.594
‐ Your father is existing

07:48.594 --> 07:50.971
and I'm trapping punch monkeys.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.723
‐ Like the ones right behind you?

07:52.723 --> 07:54.183
Oh! No!

07:54.183 --> 07:55.475
They ruined my trap.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.519
Quickly, I need to fix this before‐‐

07:57.519 --> 07:58.395
Ohh!

07:59.104 --> 08:02.858
Those mischievous miscreants
turned my own trap against me.

08:02.858 --> 08:03.525
How?

08:03.525 --> 08:07.029
‐ Because you brought
farm smarts to a jungle brawl.

08:07.029 --> 08:10.324
But I'm gonna stop those monkeys
with my inner beast.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.659
‐ How is that different
from your outer beast?

08:12.659 --> 08:14.995
‐ Oh, if you guys
wanna get rid of punch monkeys,

08:14.995 --> 08:15.746
all you gotta do is‐‐

08:15.746 --> 08:16.663
Not now, Thunk!

08:16.663 --> 08:17.998
Get me down!

08:20.375 --> 08:21.460
Thank you.

08:22.878 --> 08:23.879
If your parents catch us

08:23.879 --> 08:25.005
climbing Grrr Mountain,

08:25.005 --> 08:25.672
they'll freak out.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.924
So we need some help.

08:26.924 --> 08:29.134
‐ Or maybe my parents have a point.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.219
‐ Ha, good one.

08:30.219 --> 08:31.678
Now let's go ask Guy to cover for us.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.554
I'd love to.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.683
‐ Sorry, Guy‐Boy. Reflex.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.060
‐ Yep. My fault.

08:38.060 --> 08:40.187
Oh, so, Grrr Mountain, huh?

08:40.187 --> 08:41.230
A little mid‐day mayhem?

08:41.230 --> 08:43.482
Hmm, short notice, high stakes,

08:43.482 --> 08:45.484
but I got ya covered.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.403
I just need wood. Lots of wood.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.534
‐ Guy‐Boy, you want us to get inside that?

08:54.451 --> 08:55.452
Yes.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.913
Because that's the last place
anyone would ever look for you.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.959
‐ He's right.
I'd never look for us in there.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.127
‐ Uh, me neither.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.353
‐ Wait just a minute, Guy.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.605
‐ Hope and Ugga!

09:23.605 --> 09:26.191
Ha, just who I was hoping to run into.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.484
So, what's new?

09:27.484 --> 09:29.027
‐ You speak punch monkey, right?

09:29.027 --> 09:31.655
‐ Punch monkey? Yes. Yes, I do.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.490
‐ Great. Can you teach us how to say‐‐

09:33.490 --> 09:36.076
‐ I would love to,
but I'm in a little bit of a rush.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.162
Got a sick chicken seal on my hands,
so... gotta go.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.375
‐ That chicken seal did look a little off.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.419
‐ Yeah. Because it was made of wood.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.547
‐ You did it again, Guy.
The chicken seal worked perfectly.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.090
‐ I already miss being in there.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.593
‐ You're welcome, you maidens of mischief.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.804
And, until you return,
your secret will be safe,

09:55.804 --> 09:58.390
thanks to my clever Guy‐jinks!

09:59.641 --> 10:00.184
‐ Whoa!

10:00.184 --> 10:01.393
He vanished.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.686
‐ Guy‐Boy? Where'd you go?

10:02.686 --> 10:03.770
‐ Right here.

10:04.563 --> 10:05.314
‐ Jeez.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.232
‐ You really gotta stop doing that.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.066
For your own good.

10:08.066 --> 10:08.984
‐ Yeah.

10:08.984 --> 10:10.527
Solid advice. Yeah.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.577
‐ I don't know about this.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.537
Maybe I don't need grrr?

10:20.537 --> 10:21.747
‐ It's your call, Dawn.

10:22.164 --> 10:26.043
The question is, if you give up
on your grrr now, will you regret it?

10:26.043 --> 10:29.755
‐ Well, I definitely don't wanna
spend the rest of my life grrr‐free.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.673
‐ Then let's do this.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.550
There it is. Grrr Mountain.

10:38.972 --> 10:39.890
‐ I can't do this.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.975
‐ You don't have to.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.102
Because we're doing it together.

10:44.102 --> 10:44.853
‐ Thanks, Eep.

10:44.853 --> 10:48.565
Hey, maybe grrr
stands for gr‐r‐roup effort.

10:53.237 --> 10:56.281
‐ How exactly does this
catch punch monkeys?

10:56.281 --> 10:59.326
‐ If you wanna catch an animal,
you gotta be an animal.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.662
‐ Hardly a stretch for you.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.332
‐ Papaynapples?

11:05.332 --> 11:08.502
Ooh, I'm not gonna look
this gift fruit in the mouth.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.711
Thanks, sky!

11:12.548 --> 11:14.633
‐ Ooh! I smell papaynapple.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.302
And where there's papaynapple,
there pa‐punch monkey.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.731
Hmph! Hmm.

11:29.731 --> 11:30.649
‐ What are you doing?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.026
‐ I'm hot on the punch trail.

11:35.737 --> 11:36.864
Whoa!

11:36.864 --> 11:38.991
Monkey see, monkey done.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.957
‐ Dad, you're crushing my papaynapples.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.711
‐ Huh? This punch monkey
looks like my son.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.045
But how?

11:52.045 --> 11:54.381
‐ Dad, it's me. Thunk. Your son.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.508
‐ He even sounds like him.

11:56.508 --> 11:57.676
‐ Because I am him.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.219
Don't you know me, Dad?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.054
‐ Well, yeah. Of course.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.390
It's just, I smelled papaynapple.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.727
‐ Because the punch monkeys
were toying with you as they did me.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.897
Oh, they're clever,
those punch‐happy primates.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.357
They circumvented our solo efforts.

12:12.357 --> 12:16.195
But what if we unite your animal acumen

12:16.195 --> 12:18.363
with my inventive ingenuity

12:18.363 --> 12:20.782
against our common enemy?

12:23.368 --> 12:25.120
What say you, Grug?

12:26.580 --> 12:28.999
‐ I say I have no idea what you just said.

12:30.209 --> 12:33.295
‐ I'm asking you to team up.

12:33.295 --> 12:36.840
‐ Oh. Well, working on our own
isn't working, so, sure.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.717
Since you need me so much.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.677
‐ A fragile alliance it is.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.720
Go, Team Punch!

12:41.720 --> 12:42.429
‐ Okay.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.640
Let me know when you wanna hear my idea

12:44.640 --> 12:46.850
for how to stop the punch monkeys
from stealing.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.019
My papaynapples!

12:50.187 --> 12:52.064
This mountain is bigger than it looked.

12:52.064 --> 12:53.524
And it looked like a mountain.

12:53.524 --> 12:54.900
‐ Don't think about the mountain.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.777
Let's talk about something
to take your mind off of it.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.071
Ooh! I know. Let's swap secrets.

12:59.071 --> 13:01.114
‐ Okay. But I don't have any secrets.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.366
Especially from you.

13:02.366 --> 13:04.117
I'm an open bark journal.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.702
‐ Come on, Dawn.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.621
Everyone has secrets.

13:07.621 --> 13:08.622
I'll go first.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.834
I used to think my shadow was alive
and died when the sun went down.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.669
‐ Well, I believed that too.

13:13.669 --> 13:14.586
When I was six.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.547
‐ Yeah, I stopped believing it last week.

13:16.547 --> 13:17.548
Oh. Your turn.

13:17.548 --> 13:21.134
‐ Hmm. Well, like I said, no secrets, so‐‐

13:21.134 --> 13:23.595
‐ Really? You never did
anything embarrassing?

13:23.595 --> 13:24.888
Even as a kid?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.266
‐ Oh, no.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.768
I just remembered something awful.

13:29.768 --> 13:32.229
‐ Ooh‐hoo. Sounds juicy. Spill it.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.397
‐ Uh, maybe later.

13:33.397 --> 13:34.565
Let's just keep‐‐ Whoa!

13:34.565 --> 13:36.191
Oh, that's a big crevice.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.609
How am I gonna get across?

13:37.609 --> 13:39.027
‐ Easy. I'll help you.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.737
Right after you tell me your secret.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.406
‐ No way. It's too embarrassing.

13:42.406 --> 13:44.366
‐ In that case, see you on the other side.

13:44.366 --> 13:45.617
Yah!

13:47.452 --> 13:49.454
‐ Okay. You can do it. You can do it.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.747
Are you nuts? You can't do it.

13:50.747 --> 13:51.957
Just tell her the secret.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.125
You can't tell her the secret.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.501
Okay.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.836
That's it, you're doing this.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.259
You did it!

14:02.676 --> 14:04.386
‐ Your secret's that bad, huh?

14:06.305 --> 14:07.347
Hmm.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.392
What if Gran's wrong
and I don't get my grrr back?

14:10.851 --> 14:12.769
‐ Then you live
the rest of your life in fear.

14:12.769 --> 14:13.854
But that's not gonna happen

14:13.854 --> 14:16.273
because we're going to make it
to the top of this mountain.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.194
‐ Uh... not if I have to go in there.

14:20.194 --> 14:22.946
‐ Relax. I'll be with you
every step of the way...

14:22.946 --> 14:24.573
if you cough up your secret.

14:24.573 --> 14:27.242
‐ You know, if I tell you my secret,
it's not a secret anymore,

14:27.242 --> 14:29.369
so really there's no secret to tell.

14:30.245 --> 14:31.788
Eh, not buying it, huh?

14:31.788 --> 14:32.706
Cave it is.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.334
‐ Hey! Wait up!

14:36.376 --> 14:37.044
Did you suck your thumb?

14:37.044 --> 14:37.669
‐ No.

14:37.669 --> 14:38.378
‐ Night terrors?

14:38.378 --> 14:39.880
‐ Not even close.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.215
‐ Are your parents really crowverines?

14:41.215 --> 14:43.675
‐ That would actually
explain a lot, but no.

14:43.675 --> 14:46.512
So are you gonna help me
get across this vine or not?

14:46.512 --> 14:48.096
‐ Sure. You got this, Dawn.

14:48.096 --> 14:48.889
‐ Yah!

14:49.348 --> 14:50.516
‐ Were you a hammock‐wetter?

14:52.184 --> 14:54.645
‐ I still don't get this.

14:54.645 --> 14:57.356
‐ Once again,
when the vile simian vagabonds

14:57.356 --> 14:58.315
breach the perimeter,

14:58.315 --> 15:00.776
these pigators will start squealing.

15:00.776 --> 15:03.654
That means our target is in the hot zone.

15:03.654 --> 15:07.366
Then I'll launch
the first‐ever "living net," that's you,

15:07.366 --> 15:08.909
to ensnare the punch monkeys.

15:08.909 --> 15:09.952
It's foolproof.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.995
Or, more bluntly, you‐proof.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.664
‐ Huh. Will it hurt?

15:13.664 --> 15:14.915
‐ Yes, immensely.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.583
But no pain, no restrain.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.544
And it's the ideal symbiosis

15:18.544 --> 15:22.089
of my infinite genius
and your utilitarian bulk.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.800
‐ I heard "yes" and then noises.

15:25.801 --> 15:28.011
‐ Hey, guys.
Still trying to catch the punch monkeys?

15:28.011 --> 15:29.638
'Cause I know how to do it.

15:29.638 --> 15:32.224
‐ I'm sure you think you do, Thunk.

15:32.224 --> 15:35.185
But as you can see,
Team Punch is on the job.

15:35.185 --> 15:36.979
‐ I'm gonna be a net!

15:39.898 --> 15:42.234
‐ No! We’ve been sabotaged again!

15:45.279 --> 15:48.156
My beloved ballista!

15:49.533 --> 15:50.993
‐ Yeah. Hey, hey.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.245
We don't need that
'cause we're who we are.

15:53.245 --> 15:53.954
And you know what?

15:53.954 --> 15:56.832
You're a success 'cause look how far
you made that thing go.

15:56.832 --> 16:00.836
‐ Yes, it did soar like a majestic Eelgle.

16:03.213 --> 16:03.922
You're right.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.550
We'll prevail
over those primate purloiners.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.093
Because Team Punch.

16:09.887 --> 16:12.806
‐ And because I know
how to catch punch monkeys.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.308
‐ Fine, Thunk.

16:14.308 --> 16:15.809
Let's hear your idea.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.769
‐ All we have to do
is share our food with them.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.230
Then they'll leave us alone. Here, watch.

16:20.230 --> 16:23.817
Hey, punch monkeys,
I've got some papaynapple here.

16:24.735 --> 16:26.320
There you are, little guys.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.447
Now, you can have some papaynapple,

16:28.447 --> 16:29.489
but we have to share.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.080
Guy!

16:37.080 --> 16:38.457
‐ Oof!

16:38.457 --> 16:40.042
‐ Never gonna happen, Guy‐Face.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.919
I invented fear.

16:41.919 --> 16:43.504
Now where's Eep and other girl?

16:43.504 --> 16:44.463
‐ Eep and Dawn?

16:44.463 --> 16:46.924
Yep, they're right over there. Frolicking.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.927
Ah, that's Belt and Sash in bad wigs.

16:49.927 --> 16:52.471
I'm looking
for the real Eep and other girl.

16:52.471 --> 16:54.556
Are they back from Grrr Mountain yet?

16:54.556 --> 16:55.766
‐ Wait, you know about that?

16:55.766 --> 16:56.725
‐ Of course.

16:56.725 --> 17:01.146
I told Eep a long story about a friend
who lost her grrr

17:01.146 --> 17:04.191
and climbed Grrr Mountain to get it back.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.150
The end.

17:05.150 --> 17:05.984
‐ That's it?

17:05.984 --> 17:07.194
That's the whole story?

17:09.029 --> 17:11.406
‐ Just remembered the rest of the story.

17:11.406 --> 17:15.035
The mountain was deadly
and my friend never came back.

17:15.035 --> 17:18.247
Whew! Thought I was losing it there,
but Gran's still got it.

17:18.247 --> 17:19.790
‐ Wait, the mountain is deadly?

17:20.958 --> 17:22.543
We need to go save Eep and Dawn!

17:22.543 --> 17:23.252
We?

17:23.252 --> 17:26.129
Nah. Then I'd just have to save you too.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.631
I'll bring the girls home.

17:27.631 --> 17:30.300
You stay here
and cover for us when you wake up.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.677
‐ Wake up? But I'm not‐‐

17:35.264 --> 17:36.139
What are you do‐‐

17:36.139 --> 17:36.932
Nap tap!

17:46.358 --> 17:47.401
‐ Yes!

17:47.401 --> 17:50.863
I... I didn't think
I could do it, but I did it!

17:50.863 --> 17:54.324
Grrr Mountain, I own you!

17:54.324 --> 17:56.451
You... you!

17:57.578 --> 17:59.580
‐ One small step for Dawn...

17:59.580 --> 18:02.457
‐ One giant Eep for friend‐kind.

18:02.457 --> 18:03.667
‐ Who are you calling a giant?

18:03.667 --> 18:04.334
‐ Oh.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.460
Yeah, that didn't come out right.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.545
But we made it to the top!

18:07.629 --> 18:08.589
We did it!

18:09.756 --> 18:11.508
I guess that means I got my grrr back.

18:11.508 --> 18:12.467
Thanks for all the help.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.720
‐ You know what? You never lost your grrr.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.513
You've always had it. Just like me.

18:16.513 --> 18:17.890
‐ What are you talking about?

18:17.890 --> 18:19.016
I was terrified.

18:19.016 --> 18:21.268
‐ I'll let you in
on another little secret.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.644
I get scared too.

18:22.644 --> 18:23.478
‐ What?

18:23.478 --> 18:24.479
‐ Yeah, that's right.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.857
Storms, bearacudas, even volcanoes.

18:26.857 --> 18:27.941
But I don't let it stop me.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.026
And neither did you.

18:29.026 --> 18:30.277
That's true grrr.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.486
‐ Whoa. That's huge.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.280
This is a day to remember.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.823
I need a memento.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.366
Ooh. How about this weird rock?

18:37.284 --> 18:38.535
‐ That's not a rock.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.661
That's a tooth.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.038
A really big tooth!

18:44.333 --> 18:46.376
And that's where it came from!

18:48.253 --> 18:50.130
This mountain has a mouth!

18:52.633 --> 18:55.260
I knew Gran's story was too short!

18:55.636 --> 18:59.056
‐ Yeah, she forgot the part
about the mountain being alive!

18:59.556 --> 19:01.391
‐ This is on my scared list.

19:01.391 --> 19:02.309
Whoa!

19:03.185 --> 19:04.311
‐ Mine too.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.731
But I've got grrr.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.691
There's even a fire in my belly.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.527
Or it's the vine squeezing me.

19:11.527 --> 19:15.781
Either way, this mountain is going down!

19:19.576 --> 19:21.286
‐ That's right, other girl.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.997
Because Gran is here to save you.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.457
‐ My name is Dawn.

19:25.457 --> 19:27.668
‐ Yeah! And Dawn is gonna save us.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.962
Because she's all grrr!

19:29.962 --> 19:31.713
‐ Grrr!

19:41.974 --> 19:42.558
Whew!

19:42.558 --> 19:43.475
Not bad.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.018
But if she can save you,

19:45.018 --> 19:47.855
why did I have to come
all the way up here?

19:47.855 --> 19:49.648
‐ Not liking the look of those vines.

19:51.191 --> 19:54.695
‐ Well, it's nothing
a little Mountain Mayhem can't fix.

19:54.695 --> 19:57.114
‐ Yeah, let's grrr this hill.

19:57.114 --> 19:59.199
‐ So this part is all me, right?

19:59.199 --> 20:01.034
‐ It's okay, Gran, we got this.

20:01.577 --> 20:02.744
‐ Seriously?

20:02.744 --> 20:06.123
Last time I rush out to save you two
from a living mountain.

20:28.604 --> 20:30.647
‐ Vine block! How do we get past it?

20:30.647 --> 20:32.191
‐ Why are you asking me?

20:32.191 --> 20:33.775
This is other girl's show.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.152
And where'd she go?

20:35.152 --> 20:36.320
‐ Dawn? Oh, no!

20:36.320 --> 20:37.946
She's not here! Dawn!

20:38.488 --> 20:39.531
‐ Need a lift?

20:39.531 --> 20:41.158
Grab on!

20:47.915 --> 20:49.374
‐ Thanks for saving us.

20:49.374 --> 20:50.584
‐ I didn't save you.

20:50.584 --> 20:51.668
You saved‐‐

20:51.668 --> 20:53.629
Oh, yeah, I did save you.

20:53.629 --> 20:55.339
Thanks for reminding me that I could.

20:55.339 --> 20:56.298
You're welcome.

20:56.298 --> 20:59.885
And thanks for doing my job
back there, Dawn.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.387
‐ Hey, you remembered my name.

21:02.804 --> 21:05.224
Don't get cocky, Grrr.

21:07.100 --> 21:10.854
‐ So, we fixed the punch monkey problem.

21:10.854 --> 21:12.564
‐ While you guys were catching each other.

21:13.106 --> 21:13.982
‐ How?

21:13.982 --> 21:15.776
Did you find my beloved ballista?

21:15.776 --> 21:17.903
‐ No. We used our words.

21:17.903 --> 21:19.905
‐ Words they could understand.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.664
So, no more monkey business for a while.

21:28.664 --> 21:29.623
Thanks to us.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.041
And no thanks to you.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.587
‐ So, because you didn't help us,
we're not going to help you.

21:38.340 --> 21:42.052
‐ To be fair,
our failures made their success possible.

21:42.052 --> 21:45.806
So, in a way,
we fixed the punch monkey problem.

21:45.806 --> 21:48.100
‐ Yes! Go, Team Punch!

21:48.100 --> 21:50.769
‐ Hey, you know who'd be perfect
for Team Punch?

21:50.769 --> 21:51.770
The punch monkeys!

21:55.649 --> 21:58.151
‐ So... I got you something.

21:58.861 --> 21:59.820
A grrrmento.

21:59.820 --> 22:01.029
Or grrrvenir.

22:01.029 --> 22:02.155
Your choice.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.158
‐ I married a pumpkin.

22:05.158 --> 22:05.868
‐ What?

22:05.868 --> 22:07.202
‐ That's my secret.

22:07.202 --> 22:08.036
When I was really little,

22:08.036 --> 22:09.621
my best friend was a pumpkin named Gordo,

22:09.621 --> 22:12.040
and I loved him so much,
I pretended to marry him.

22:13.584 --> 22:15.878
‐ Whoa. That's incredible.

22:15.878 --> 22:17.254
‐ You should see the wedding album.

22:23.969 --> 22:26.263
Thanks for being the best best friend.

22:26.263 --> 22:27.055
‐ Aw.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.183
Thanks for sharing the best secret
I've ever heard.

22:32.311 --> 22:34.021
‐ How long do you think
Guy will be asleep?

22:34.646 --> 22:36.690
‐ Oh. Gran said not too long.

22:36.690 --> 22:38.066
Three days, tops.
