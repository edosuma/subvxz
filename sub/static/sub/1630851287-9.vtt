<i> Hello, boys.</i>

00:36.278 --> 00:37.611
-How's the homework?
-You know, Dad,

00:37.705 --> 00:38.779
I've never thought to ask.

00:38.931 --> 00:40.614
How are you, polynomials?

00:40.766 --> 00:42.357
I'm getting nothing.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.543
I see Moon is outside doing
his daily perimeter watch.

00:44.770 --> 00:46.270
Yep. So far, no bogeys.

00:46.288 --> 00:48.213
Ah, poor guy.
He would love to see a bogey.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.549
Come on, bogeys.
(sighs)

00:50.700 --> 00:52.459
Another all clear.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.777
Wait!

00:53.870 --> 00:55.128
I got one!

00:55.222 --> 00:59.499
Oh, no. Is that...?
No, no, no, no, no! (groans)

00:59.560 --> 01:00.875
Code Chartreuse!

01:00.969 --> 01:03.312
Code Chartreuse?
Grab the binder!

01:04.231 --> 01:05.806
Burgundy, cerulean,

01:05.900 --> 01:07.733
chartreuse.
Oh, no, no!

01:07.960 --> 01:09.234
Great Gary's Gonads.

01:09.461 --> 01:12.446
-It can't be.
-What's Tusk?

01:14.149 --> 01:15.816
TUSK:
Tobins, I know you're in there.

01:15.968 --> 01:18.726
I can hear Wolf. He breathes
really loud through his nose.

01:18.746 --> 01:19.894
(breathes loudly through nose)

01:19.988 --> 01:22.164
(whispering):
I do not.

01:22.975 --> 01:25.142
(laughs) Ol' Beef.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.068
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> Ugh, look at it.</i>

01:27.162 --> 01:28.903
That's prime kiosk
real estate right there.

01:28.997 --> 01:30.330
And it'll be all mine
when I win

01:30.424 --> 01:32.591
the "Kiss the Kiosk"
competition this Friday night.

01:32.818 --> 01:34.000
Okay, now, walk me through

01:34.095 --> 01:35.669
this whole "Kiss the Kiosk"
thing again.

01:35.821 --> 01:37.838
Are you judged based on
how romantic the kiss is?

01:37.932 --> 01:39.414
It's actually
a three-part contest

01:39.433 --> 01:41.583
where you have to keep
a body part on the kiosk

01:41.602 --> 01:42.843
as long as possible.

01:42.995 --> 01:43.994
The first round
is "Hug the Hut."

01:44.012 --> 01:44.845
Second round
is "Butts on a Booth."

01:44.997 --> 01:46.179
And in the third round,

01:46.348 --> 01:48.332
whoever kisses it the longest
gets to kiss it forever.

01:48.425 --> 01:49.775
It's based on how
we used to decide

01:49.926 --> 01:51.668
who got to be governor
of Alaska.

01:51.687 --> 01:53.928
I did not know having a kiosk
was your big dream, Honeybee.

01:54.022 --> 01:55.597
I didn't either, until recently.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.949
I've been reading
Guy Fieri's new book,

01:57.176 --> 01:58.892
<i> I Believe I Can Guy,</i>
and it's really helping me

01:59.044 --> 02:00.619
believe in myself.
He made me think,

02:00.846 --> 02:02.863
"Why shouldn't I sell
my leggings at a mall kiosk?"

02:02.957 --> 02:04.197
Ooh, are you sure
you want to do that?

02:04.350 --> 02:06.125
Mall kiosking is
a pretty cutthroat lifestyle.

02:06.352 --> 02:08.368
Really? Everybody seems
like they're having fun.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.111
Like the light-up
flyer toy dude

02:10.131 --> 02:12.189
and my friend Leslie
of Leslie's Lotions.

02:12.282 --> 02:14.691
-Oh, there she is.
-Honeybee, hey!

02:14.784 --> 02:16.117
Hey, Leslie! Busy day?

02:16.137 --> 02:17.803
Bulbs above my kiosk
went out again.

02:18.030 --> 02:19.304
Been working
at this mall so long,

02:19.456 --> 02:21.531
I feel like I could maintain
the whole place myself.

02:21.550 --> 02:23.291
See you at "Kiss the Kiosk"
on Friday.

02:23.427 --> 02:24.885
Wait, she's gonna try
to win another kiosk?

02:24.979 --> 02:26.294
Yup.

02:26.463 --> 02:28.538
She has an idea for hand soaps
that smell like soups.

02:28.632 --> 02:29.556
They're called Soup Soaps.

02:29.708 --> 02:30.874
I'd have to stop myself

02:30.893 --> 02:32.467
from eating my own hands,
but I love it.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.135
<i> TUSK:</i>
<i> I know, it sounds crazy,</i>

02:34.229 --> 02:36.229
but I've cleaned up,
doing my 12 steps.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.472
I've cut out the booze,

02:37.566 --> 02:39.216
the liquid cocaine,
the regular cocaine,

02:39.309 --> 02:40.734
and I no longer participate

02:40.886 --> 02:41.827
in the black market
for endangered animals.

02:41.978 --> 02:43.495
Not the same guy I used to be.

02:43.722 --> 02:46.147
Oh, good, because that guy
almost got my son killed,

02:46.241 --> 02:48.558
and if he was here,
I'd certainly glare at him.

02:48.652 --> 02:49.835
Like this.

02:49.986 --> 02:53.839
Tusk Johnson's on his way here,
and-- Oh.

02:54.066 --> 02:56.658
Well, guess I'll go put on
some tea, then.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.343
Tusk, what are you
really doing here?

02:58.570 --> 03:01.738
Well, that's the big news. Your
old pal Tusk is getting married.

03:01.757 --> 03:02.848
-Congratulations.
-Impossible.

03:02.999 --> 03:03.998
Come on. To a human?

03:04.092 --> 03:06.167
Or is this like
that situation in France

03:06.261 --> 03:07.577
where the lady married a bridge?

03:07.596 --> 03:08.836
I'm marrying Doris.

03:08.931 --> 03:10.096
You remember,
my gal pal from the bar.

03:10.249 --> 03:12.416
Yes. She threw up
on our doormat.

03:12.509 --> 03:14.418
That's my angel.
We got sober together.

03:14.436 --> 03:17.362
And it turns out, you can
get knocked up at 53. Who knew?

03:17.589 --> 03:20.014
Anyway, baby's due next month,
wedding's this weekend,

03:20.034 --> 03:21.867
and I just wanted
to stop by and, uh,

03:22.094 --> 03:24.894
say I'm sorry, and ask you
to give me a second chance.

03:24.896 --> 03:26.038
Well, Tusk, you did lie to me,

03:26.189 --> 03:27.931
turn me and my dad
against each other,

03:28.024 --> 03:30.784
and let me dangle
for my life over a canyon,

03:30.936 --> 03:32.452
but I can't stay mad at you.

03:32.604 --> 03:33.937
Second chance initiated.

03:34.030 --> 03:37.365
That means a lot, Wolf.
Beef? Second chance-a-rooni?

03:37.384 --> 03:38.366
Fine.

03:38.460 --> 03:40.610
Thank you, Beef.
Oh, one other thing.

03:40.629 --> 03:41.628
Ah, here we go.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.612
I was thinking of having
a bachelor party.

03:42.706 --> 03:43.964
Sweet!

03:44.132 --> 03:47.133
And I was hoping that maybe
you could throw it for me.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.894
Something simple,
like on your boat.

03:49.045 --> 03:50.637
I sold mine after I got sober.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.046
Needed the money
for a family car.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.715
Before that,
I was just renting the boat out

03:53.734 --> 03:55.292
for porno shoots anyway.

03:55.310 --> 03:57.552
If you've seen a porno, it's
probably been shot on my boat.

03:57.604 --> 03:59.071
-Go ahead, name a porn.
-I'd rather not.

03:59.298 --> 04:00.797
Yup, shot on my boat.
Name another.

04:00.816 --> 04:02.908
-No, sir.
-Also shot on my boat.
Name another.

04:03.059 --> 04:05.560
-This is so fun.
-Yup, parts one and two.

04:05.654 --> 04:07.988
-I feel uncomfortable.
-Again, shot on my boat.

04:08.082 --> 04:10.749
-What's a porno?
-That one, too.
Very educational.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.142
<i> Orgy Ahoy?</i>

04:12.235 --> 04:14.253
That was shot on a soundstage,
believe it or not.

04:14.404 --> 04:16.663
Uh, Wolf, can I speak to you out
on the porch for just a moment?

04:16.815 --> 04:19.499
If you want to talk wedding
gifts for Tusk and Doris,

04:19.651 --> 04:21.668
I know for a fact
that they adore cigarettes.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.579
Wolf, we cannot throw that man
a bachelor party on our boat.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.006
I don't trust him.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.100
But you just said you'd
give him a second chance, Dad,

04:28.251 --> 04:30.102
and if you say it,
you got to mean it.

04:30.253 --> 04:32.345
Remember you always used to
think that the checkout lady

04:32.498 --> 04:33.755
at the grocery store, Connie,

04:33.849 --> 04:35.089
would always manhandle
your bread?

04:35.109 --> 04:36.591
But then you tried
self-checkout,

04:36.610 --> 04:37.776
and what happened?

04:37.927 --> 04:39.836
I dropped and then
stepped on my bread.

04:39.855 --> 04:42.188
That's right. You dropped it
and you stepped on it,

04:42.341 --> 04:44.432
and Connie came over
and gave you new bread,

04:44.451 --> 04:46.118
and you gave her
a second chance,

04:46.345 --> 04:48.603
and your bread's been
A-OK ever since.

04:48.697 --> 04:50.180
My point is,

04:50.273 --> 04:53.183
sometimes you got to give people
an opportunity to be better,

04:53.201 --> 04:54.534
a real second chance.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.795
Fine, let's throw
a bachelor party on our boat

04:56.946 --> 04:58.522
for a man that
almost murdered you.

04:58.540 --> 04:59.947
That's the stuff.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.708
Now, what do you say,
father-son forgiveness snuggle?

05:01.860 --> 05:03.043
Bring it in, Dad.

05:03.244 --> 05:06.046
Tusk, will you make me
the happiest man in the world

05:06.198 --> 05:08.140
and have your bachelor party
on our boat?

05:08.291 --> 05:10.550
Yes! (laughs)
Oh, thank you so much.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.127
Me, Doris, and Adonis
won't forget this.

05:13.147 --> 05:14.871
Yeah, we're naming it
Adonis, boy or girl.

05:14.964 --> 05:17.983
If it's a girl, Adonis Rebecca.
If it's a boy, Adonis Mike.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.468
How's party planning
going, babe?

05:20.487 --> 05:22.136
Well, I've already got
the perfect guest list:

05:22.156 --> 05:24.639
me, Dad, Jerry, Moon,
Ham, and Crispin.

05:24.733 --> 05:26.232
Doesn't Tusk have
any friends of his own?

05:26.385 --> 05:28.327
I guess there's
his old sidekick Dan.

05:28.478 --> 05:29.477
The guy he used to make do

05:29.496 --> 05:30.570
all the dangerous
stunts on his show?

05:30.722 --> 05:31.854
Yeah,

05:31.856 --> 05:33.056
but Dad and I are
pretty sure he's dead,

05:33.075 --> 05:34.574
so that's probably
a touchy subject.

05:34.726 --> 05:36.501
But enough about Tusk's party.
I'm so excited for you

05:36.653 --> 05:38.061
to compete
in the kiosk competition.

05:38.154 --> 05:40.188
Just remember,
if it gets down to the wire,

05:40.190 --> 05:41.173
try the tortoise move.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.749
You just shout,
"Hey, look, a tortoise!"

05:42.901 --> 05:45.177
Then watch your competitor's
concentration shatter,

05:45.328 --> 05:46.994
because who wouldn't want
to see a tortoise?

05:47.014 --> 05:48.663
And you've actually tried this?

05:48.757 --> 05:50.998
Thought of it just now,
but, trust me, it's solid.

05:51.093 --> 05:53.501
Hey, it's the man of the hour.

05:53.520 --> 05:57.097
Welcome to bach-town, baby.
Population: you.

05:57.249 --> 05:59.249
And the rest of us, so, uh,
like, seven people.

05:59.267 --> 06:02.102
This looks great, Wolf.
All my favorite buds are here.

06:02.196 --> 06:05.422
You, your dad,
your child brothers,

06:05.440 --> 06:06.848
this guy...

06:06.867 --> 06:09.759
Hey, I'm Jerry, and I have
no idea who you are either.

06:09.853 --> 06:11.203
I just know
I'm not supposed to trust you.

06:11.430 --> 06:13.947
(laughs) Easy, Jerry.
Where'd you hear that?

06:14.099 --> 06:15.707
I'm bad at lying.
He heard that from me.

06:15.859 --> 06:18.952
That's fair. Jerry, truth is, I
used to be a bit of a bad seed,

06:19.046 --> 06:21.028
and now I'm trying
to be a good tree,

06:21.123 --> 06:22.956
but trust is earned, not given.

06:23.108 --> 06:25.775
All right, time to pull up
anchor and set sail.

06:25.794 --> 06:28.461
If this boat's a-moving,
Tusk's party is grooving.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.721
Wait. Wait up.

06:29.948 --> 06:31.965
I'm looking for Tusk Johnson's
bachelor party?

06:32.117 --> 06:34.117
-(Wolf and Beef gasp)
-Well, split my wood.

06:34.136 --> 06:37.104
Oh, my God.
It's Tusk's old sidekick Dan.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.294
Dan, great to see you
and tell you face-to-face,

06:44.312 --> 06:47.072
I'm sorry I let you take the
fall on that bogus land deal.

06:47.223 --> 06:48.481
I was a different person
back then.

06:48.634 --> 06:50.817
Oh, no biggie.
Jail wasn't all bad.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.077
I had a job
in the prison cafeteria,

06:52.304 --> 06:54.079
so I got to put extra oatmeal
in my pockets.

06:54.306 --> 06:55.822
When you didn't respond
to my Evite,

06:55.974 --> 06:57.140
I figured you weren't coming.

06:57.159 --> 06:59.418
Well, I-I mean,
I guess I was mad at you

06:59.569 --> 07:01.494
when I was in jail,
but I'm out,

07:01.588 --> 07:03.922
and I can eat sour cream
and onion chips whenever I want,

07:04.149 --> 07:06.574
so my life is perfect now,
and all is forgiven.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.909
Would you look at that?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.410
Two of my best friends
being best friends again.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.337
I mean, I know
I just met you, Dan,

07:11.432 --> 07:12.931
but I got a great feeling
about it.

07:13.158 --> 07:14.824
Now, let me walk everyone
through tonight's P-plan.

07:14.843 --> 07:17.769
That's short for party plan.
We got a snow cone machine,

07:17.921 --> 07:20.605
a banging bag of chips,
a cake by Ham...

07:20.832 --> 07:24.017
With a special Tusk Johnson
surprise on the inside.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.944
If it's a puppy,
I will be so excited.

07:26.171 --> 07:28.613
We've also got the Ship-N-Slide
inflatable for Moon,

07:28.765 --> 07:30.264
and to cap off the evening,

07:30.358 --> 07:33.176
a sweet-ass laser light dubstep
show that, believe it or not,

07:33.269 --> 07:34.268
I found on Craigslist.

07:34.362 --> 07:36.346
-I believe it.
-But, right now,

07:54.475 --> 07:56.141
Just imagine
that kiosk is a door,

07:56.368 --> 07:57.717
and you're Kate Winslet floating
in the freezing cold ocean,

07:57.869 --> 08:00.553

or any extras try to get on,

08:00.706 --> 08:03.039

-Great plan, Judy.

Dabbie's Crabby Babbies.

08:09.715 --> 08:11.898
I sell a line of baby bibs

Hey, Honeybee.
Oh, my gosh, look at...

08:14.477 --> 08:15.660
(singsongy):
u-us.

08:15.812 --> 08:18.738
All women over here.
Uh, can you say girl power?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.314
Yeah. Girl power.
That's easy to say.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.908
Why would anyone
not be able to say that?

08:22.060 --> 08:23.743
Good evening.
I'm the mall administrator,

08:23.895 --> 08:25.745
Mr. Jarvis Dufraine,
for those who don't know me,

08:25.897 --> 08:28.081
and for those who do know me,
yes, I did get a new haircut.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.674
I'm not sure I love it,
but I'm not sure

08:29.826 --> 08:31.401
-I'm ready to talk about it.
-It's all right.

08:31.494 --> 08:32.919
I just said I'm not ready
to talk about it.

08:33.071 --> 08:34.571
Okay, now before we Hug The Hut,

08:34.664 --> 08:36.163
please join me
in a moment of silence

08:36.258 --> 08:38.332
for the previous owner
of this kiosk, Burt Galasky,

08:38.352 --> 08:41.002
who recently died doing what
he loved, being in his kiosk.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.838
Oh, my God.
Someone died in this kiosk?

08:43.932 --> 08:45.190
You're so brave to be here

08:45.341 --> 08:46.858
because everyone knows,
late in pregnancy,

08:47.085 --> 08:50.529
a thin portal between our world
and the netherworld opens up.

08:50.756 --> 08:52.013
Leslie, stop scaring her.

08:52.107 --> 08:53.848
I'm not. I'm just saying,
in her condition,

08:53.867 --> 08:56.276
it's very easy for a ghost
to get in her baby.

08:56.428 --> 08:59.279
Okay, that's enough silence.
Everybody, hug the hut.

08:59.431 --> 09:00.521
Listen, if my water breaks

09:00.615 --> 09:02.265
while we're still
hugging this thing,

09:02.284 --> 09:03.616
one of you will have
to deliver this baby.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.286
I delivered all six
of my own kids in a cedar bath,

09:06.438 --> 09:07.546
so if push comes to shove,

09:07.697 --> 09:09.289
we can get in the fountain
and go for it.

09:09.441 --> 09:11.550
Can I get your phone number
for when I have kids?

09:11.777 --> 09:13.552
-Yes, it's four.
-Just four?

09:13.779 --> 09:15.128
I'll tell you the rest later.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.630

I haven't had
this much sober fun

09:23.471 --> 09:25.230
since the hallway carnival
at my rehab.

09:25.457 --> 09:28.215
I'm a little nervous about this
wind and my laser light show.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.459
Eh, what's a little wind?

Hmm... you seem very interested

09:33.073 --> 09:34.739
in keeping us out here
in this weather.

09:34.891 --> 09:36.074
Classic Tusk.

09:36.225 --> 09:37.742
If he wants to stay out,
we're gonna stay out.

09:37.969 --> 09:40.579
And if he wants a bag of blood,
he gets a bag of your blood.

09:40.730 --> 09:42.730
Uh-oh, guys, looks like
we're in serious Trouble.

09:42.824 --> 09:45.917
We're also in serious Scrabble,
Parcheesi, and Operation.

09:46.144 --> 09:47.586
I'm in.
Ooh, let's play Operation.

09:47.737 --> 09:49.588
I took my own appendix out
in the wild once,

09:49.739 --> 09:50.814
and I was not bad at it.

09:50.832 --> 09:52.257
Hey, uh, Beef? Quick word?

09:52.408 --> 09:54.150
Listen, I'm a little concerned

09:54.243 --> 09:56.761
that Tusk might be
up to something here tonight.

09:56.913 --> 09:58.655
Only because he's always
up to something.

09:58.673 --> 10:01.157
I had those same concerns,
but I'm prepared.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.884
-I've got a detachable radio...
-Mm-hmm.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.160

-Mm-hmm.

10:04.179 --> 10:05.937
...and our exact nav data
in the cabin.

10:06.089 --> 10:07.831
What about a way
to defend yourself?

10:07.924 --> 10:09.423
I'm sure it won't come to that,

10:09.517 --> 10:12.593
but I've got an antique trident
in the hold for predatory birds.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.614
I wouldn't be opposed
to using it for predatory turds,

10:15.841 --> 10:17.006
if you know what I mean.

10:17.025 --> 10:18.933
(chuckles) Yeah,
you're saying Tusk is a turd.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.602
(chuckles) Yup.
You nailed it, buddy.

10:21.696 --> 10:23.012
That ends round one.

10:23.031 --> 10:24.697
Contestants,
now please turn around

10:24.791 --> 10:25.940
and put your butts on the booth.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.200
You're doing great, Honeybee.

10:27.352 --> 10:29.110
Your butt's looking
super solid so far.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.112
Oh, I love putting
my butt on things.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.947
I once put my butt
on Pierce Brosnan

10:32.966 --> 10:34.799
for a few moments
at a farmers market

10:34.951 --> 10:36.542
while he was selecting
some rhubarb,

10:36.695 --> 10:38.044
but I didn't get
to keep him afterwards.

10:38.196 --> 10:40.805
Okay, Honeybee.
Keep your butt on the prize.

10:41.032 --> 10:43.975
Oh, so nice that you have
good people here to support you.

10:44.127 --> 10:46.536
What about you? Any family
or friends in the crowd?

10:46.629 --> 10:48.388
No, no. Kids moved away

10:48.540 --> 10:49.873
and the old hubs died last month

10:49.966 --> 10:51.316
when a tree fell on him
in our orchard.

10:51.467 --> 10:53.300
I've always said
you can't trust trees.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.986
They're jealous of us
'cause we get to walk around.

10:55.138 --> 10:57.730
Anyway, now I pass the time
making little figurines

10:57.824 --> 10:59.807
from that very tree for revenge.

10:59.901 --> 11:02.719
I need the kiosk so I can have
a place to sell them.

Uh-oh. I felt the baby kick.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.072
-No.
-Probably.

11:06.241 --> 11:08.892
I know for a fact there's
a really nasty poltergeist

Gags and Goofs store over there.

-No. No. This isn't worth it.

Whoa!

Getting a little too choppy
out here for my liking.

11:42.852 --> 11:43.702

But, Dad,

11:44.854 --> 11:46.279

Actually, Wolf,
I think your dad is right.

11:48.099 --> 11:51.192
No, Tusk, I said-- Oh.
Yes, correct, I am right.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.045
Okay, I'll head into
the cabin and steer us home.

11:54.272 --> 11:56.122
-Ha!
-Dan, what are you doing?

11:56.216 --> 11:59.426

This ship isn't going anywhere.

12:02.630 --> 12:04.630
DAN: I'll hit you with
the bullet points on this.

12:04.632 --> 12:08.042
One, I am still pissed at Tusk.
Two, prison hardened me,

12:08.061 --> 12:09.619
and I did nothing but think
of how to get revenge

12:09.712 --> 12:12.638
the whole time,
even on visiting magician night.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.566
Listen, Dan, I know
you're mad at Tusk,

12:14.793 --> 12:15.975
but you don't want to do this.

12:16.127 --> 12:17.402
Of course I want to do this.

12:17.553 --> 12:19.145
Did you not just hear
everything I said?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.889
Prison? Revenge?
Visiting magician?

12:21.908 --> 12:23.074
Now, Tusk,

12:23.301 --> 12:25.635
remember those smugglers
you double-crossed

12:25.728 --> 12:27.653
by getting them to buy
a bunch of baby ostriches?

12:27.748 --> 12:29.989
Oh, right. I told them
they were baby pterodactyls

12:30.141 --> 12:32.475
and they could open
a Jurassic Park franchise.

12:32.494 --> 12:33.643
They were very dumb.

12:33.736 --> 12:35.402
Well, those smugglers
are still pissed

12:35.422 --> 12:36.921
and they're gonna
be here any second

12:37.073 --> 12:39.573
so I can hand you over
to them and get $2,000.

12:39.667 --> 12:41.760
Two? I bet you could've
gotten five. They hate me.

12:41.911 --> 12:44.411

in the system

12:47.601 --> 12:49.100
has shut off all the heaters
in the mall.

12:49.252 --> 12:50.584
We're working on
getting them back up.

12:50.678 --> 12:53.379
Oh, I don't think I'm gonna last
much longer in this cold.

12:53.531 --> 12:55.681
Very lucky that you're wearing
that parka, Leslie.

12:55.834 --> 12:57.609
-Huh.
-What do you mean, "Huh"?

12:57.836 --> 12:58.943
It is pretty convenient

12:59.095 --> 13:01.262
that you happen to be
all bundled up indoors

13:01.281 --> 13:03.430
and then the heat
mysteriously shorts out.

13:03.525 --> 13:05.525
I wore it because
this is my lucky parka.

13:05.677 --> 13:07.360
Worn this baby
to four colonoscopies,

13:07.512 --> 13:09.270
and they went great.
Polyp-free, baby.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.105
You're always bragging to me
about how you've been working

13:11.124 --> 13:13.816
at this mall for so long
that you know it inside and out.

13:13.818 --> 13:15.442
What are you saying, Honeybee?

13:15.537 --> 13:17.111
That I know this mall
so well I was able

13:17.130 --> 13:19.297
to preset the heaters
to shut off at a certain time

13:19.448 --> 13:21.633
so that I could win this kiosk,
which I deserve?

13:21.860 --> 13:24.544
Well, that wasn't exactly what
I was thinking, but now it is.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.971
And I guess you think
I made up those ghost stories

13:27.198 --> 13:28.381
just to scare Dabbie away, too.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.791
Uh, yes, now I'm
also thinking that.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.036
Look, you want to be
in the kiosk biz, Honeybee,

13:33.129 --> 13:35.388
you better toughen up.
Everybody's like this--

13:35.540 --> 13:37.373
the flying toy guy,
the calendar lady.

13:37.466 --> 13:38.966
There's a reason
I don't know their names.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.301
We are not friends.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.894
You wouldn't be able
to hack it, Honeybee.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.470
Neither would that old lady
right there

13:43.490 --> 13:45.565
who wants to sell
fancy sticks at a mall.

13:45.659 --> 13:48.309
Sticks, my ass.
They're figurines. (shudders)

13:48.403 --> 13:49.886
Here, sweetie, use my body heat.

13:49.979 --> 13:53.665
Oh, thank you. The second digit
in my phone number is six.

13:53.816 --> 13:56.242
Ugh, this is all my fault.

13:56.394 --> 13:58.061
I just had to throw this party.

13:58.079 --> 13:59.896
Actually, it might be my fault.

13:59.914 --> 14:02.323
No, no, guys.
I'm the one who invited Dan.

14:02.417 --> 14:04.250
But I may know a way
we can get out of this.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.160
I happen to know
he's terrible with a spear.

14:06.254 --> 14:07.570
I'm telling you,
he couldn't stab

14:07.589 --> 14:08.829
the broad side of a barn,
and we tried.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.073
I literally tried
to make him stab a barn,

14:10.166 --> 14:11.332
and he couldn't do it.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.742
If we work together,
we can take him

14:12.760 --> 14:14.410
before he can stab
one of us, or at least before

14:14.429 --> 14:16.020
he can stab one of us
in a vital organ.

14:16.172 --> 14:18.172
It's not a terrible plan.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.765
It's better than the one
I had in mind,

14:19.918 --> 14:22.101
which, honestly, where
would we even get the detonator

14:22.253 --> 14:23.361
or the nuclear material?

14:23.471 --> 14:25.196
All right, Tusk,
let's give it a try.

14:25.348 --> 14:26.439
Okay, here's what we do,

14:26.533 --> 14:28.366
I'll create
a distraction and then...

14:28.593 --> 14:31.035
-BOTH: Hello.
-Ah, panther penis.

14:31.187 --> 14:32.537
(gasps) Uh-oh, the smugglers.

14:32.764 --> 14:34.521
Okay, why does everyone
have a trident?

14:34.541 --> 14:37.041
Is it weird, or is it weird
that I don't have a trident?

14:37.193 --> 14:40.712
Oh, hi, everybody. I'm Cal and
this is my twin sister Jennifer.

14:40.863 --> 14:43.122
And we're smugglers. Ta-da!

14:43.274 --> 14:45.124
So, whose boat is this?

14:45.218 --> 14:47.627
-It's my dad's.
-It is gorgeous.

14:47.779 --> 14:50.722
Hey, guys. Here's Tusk Johnson.
You can take him off the boat,

14:50.873 --> 14:53.966
and I'll be taking two grand
and one of these lifeboats.

14:54.119 --> 14:55.894
Not so fast, sidekick.

14:56.045 --> 14:57.211
You were with Tusk back then,

14:57.230 --> 14:58.454
that means you
double-crossed us, too.

14:58.547 --> 14:59.639
We're taking both of you.

14:59.791 --> 15:01.382
What? Wait.
What are you gonna do with me?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.459
I don't know.
What do you think, bro?

15:03.478 --> 15:05.236
I don't know.
What do you think, sis?

15:05.463 --> 15:07.980
I don't know.
What do you think, bro?

15:08.133 --> 15:09.982
No idea. What do you think, sis?

15:10.135 --> 15:11.300
Are they gonna k...

15:11.394 --> 15:13.411
You know what?
We don't have to have

15:13.638 --> 15:15.413
our entire hostage plan
figured out right now.

15:15.564 --> 15:17.974
That's a great attitude,
just enjoy the journey.

15:17.992 --> 15:20.326
But twin sis and I have
great news for you, bushy beard.

15:20.478 --> 15:21.994
We're giving you
a brand-new boat,

15:22.088 --> 15:23.329
and we're taking yours.

15:23.481 --> 15:25.164
Oh, come on,
these people aren't involved.

15:25.316 --> 15:26.816
Take me, but leave their boat.

15:26.834 --> 15:28.317
No can do, Tusk.

15:28.411 --> 15:30.002
Excuse me,
Mr. and Mrs. Smuggler,

15:30.155 --> 15:31.504
could I take
the inflatable bouncy slide?

15:31.598 --> 15:33.990
Oh, great call, Moon.
It's a rental, too,

15:34.008 --> 15:36.325
and I really don't want to lose
my deposit on that bad boy.

15:36.344 --> 15:38.436
Sure. We're not monsters.

15:38.587 --> 15:41.422
The deposit on those inflatable
party things is insane.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.833
We totally get it. We have kids.

15:43.926 --> 15:45.835
Oh. Together?

15:45.928 --> 15:48.262
And can we take the cake?
I worked really hard on it.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.523
That's fine. We're doing
a keto thing anyways.

15:50.675 --> 15:52.675
We want to look good
for the wedding photos.

15:52.694 --> 15:56.437
And you're marrying...?

15:56.531 --> 15:59.457
All right. Let's get you guys
over to your new ride.

15:59.684 --> 16:01.350
There she goes.

16:01.444 --> 16:03.035
I've lost another Kathleen.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.629
Two, three, four.

16:04.856 --> 16:06.872
-♪<i> Oh, what a boat,</i>
<i> what a boat...</i> ♪
-Guys, no.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.874
Those were some of
the most poorly tied knots

16:09.027 --> 16:11.377
I've ever had
the displeasure of untying.

16:11.529 --> 16:14.288
Well, seems like they disabled
this boat, so we're stuck here.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.473
Chitty-chitty dang-dang.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.809
Sorry, Dad. Feels like
this was all my fault.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.477
Actually, son,
this was my fault.

16:19.628 --> 16:21.980
I was so blinded
by my mistrust of Tusk,

16:22.131 --> 16:24.298
I let my guard down
with someone I barely knew.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.632
What do you mean?

16:25.652 --> 16:27.151
I was so worried about Tusk
that I trusted Dan.

16:27.303 --> 16:28.486
I let him trick me
into giving him

16:28.713 --> 16:30.880
everything he needed
to hold us hostage.

16:30.973 --> 16:32.398
I basically gave him
the trident.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.568
But my biggest problem is,
I didn't follow your example.

16:35.720 --> 16:36.902
If I'd listened to you

16:37.071 --> 16:39.163
when you said to give someone
a real second chance,

16:39.315 --> 16:40.389
this wouldn't have happened.

16:40.408 --> 16:42.074
I stepped on my bread
all over again.

16:42.227 --> 16:44.318
Well, do you want to follow
my example now, Dad?

16:44.412 --> 16:47.246
'Cause I may have a haphazard,
ill-conceived way

16:47.340 --> 16:49.582
-to get back to the boat.
-Sounds perfect.

16:49.734 --> 16:51.658
Are you sure you guys

16:51.678 --> 16:53.903
are gonna be able
to catch the boat using this?

16:53.996 --> 16:56.422
Nope, but Tusk was right,
they are very dumb,

16:56.516 --> 16:58.182
and they are steering the
<i> Kathleen</i> right into the wind,

16:58.334 --> 17:00.167
so she's gonna list around
in a circle,

17:00.261 --> 17:01.352
and we're gonna pass
right by her.

17:01.579 --> 17:03.246
-Ham, you got the remote?
-Uh-huh.

17:03.264 --> 17:04.430
-You know what to do?
-Yup.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.340
But hold on, Wolf.
The cake surprise.

17:06.434 --> 17:08.675
I baked a stainless steel
tusk into the cake,

17:08.695 --> 17:10.677
you know, for Tusk. Take it.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.680
So that's why you wanted
the cake, so we'd have a weapon.

17:13.775 --> 17:16.200
Actually, I just really wanted
everyone to get a piece.

17:16.352 --> 17:17.702
The weapon was kind of a bonus.

17:17.853 --> 17:20.538
All right, Dad, let's bounce.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.045
Crap, this thing's busted.

17:27.196 --> 17:28.604
We're supposed to be doing
keto anyway, Jennifer.

17:28.697 --> 17:31.107
I can only eat so many
salami cheese roll-ups

17:31.200 --> 17:32.592
dipped in mayo, Cal.

17:35.338 --> 17:36.703
I think that's the signal.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.631
Oh, good. I thought those were
the northern lights,

17:38.783 --> 17:41.300
and I was like, "Damn, the
northern lights are garbage."

17:41.394 --> 17:43.803
Jennifer, what does
"een-gene" mean?

17:43.897 --> 17:45.304
I don't know.
How do you spell it?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.640

She's the owner of the boatyard

-He sure is.

18:58.287 --> 18:59.378
Should we throw him a rope?

18:59.530 --> 19:00.863
Nah, he's climbing aboard
over there.

-Now he does.

19:04.552 --> 19:05.626
DAN:
Stupid Dan.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.979
Tusk, I guess I owe you
an apology.

19:08.206 --> 19:09.538
Oh, no, you don't.

19:09.557 --> 19:11.390
Thanks for throwing me
a very memorable bachelor party.

name the baby

19:17.565 --> 19:20.474
but we've got three contestants
still kissing that kiosk.

I believe I can Guy.
I believe I can...

19:24.739 --> 19:26.813
(snores)

19:26.833 --> 19:29.316
Honeybee. Hey, Honeybee.

19:29.410 --> 19:30.835
Guy Fieri?
What are you doing here?

19:31.062 --> 19:32.653
Well, I'm kind of worried
about this competition.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.748
I thought we could have
a little "Guy" talk. Get it?

19:35.842 --> 19:38.067
'Cause your name is Guy.
(laughs)

19:38.085 --> 19:40.236
That's hilarious.
Is there anything you can't do?

19:40.254 --> 19:41.679
I can't wear my hair flat.

19:41.830 --> 19:44.073
This is my natural color and
shape. It's just how it grows.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.165
It's beautiful.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.592
I know, but listen, Honeybee,

19:46.686 --> 19:49.078
are you sure this kiosk
is what you really want?

19:49.171 --> 19:51.838
Do you really want to end up
like Lotion Leslie?

19:51.858 --> 19:53.432
Moist but miserable?

19:53.526 --> 19:55.693
Being successful
doesn't mean being cutthroat.

19:55.844 --> 19:57.511
That's what Food Network's
<i> Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives</i>

19:57.530 --> 20:00.773
is all about-- supporting small
restaurateurs across the nation.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.702
Helping people-- that's
the "key-osk" to a happy life.

20:04.929 --> 20:07.112
You do that,
and the Guy's the limit.

20:07.265 --> 20:08.706
Thank you, Mr. Fieri, and, um,

20:08.857 --> 20:11.600
you got some queso in that
hair triangle under your lip.

20:11.694 --> 20:15.696
Honeybee, it's always there,
just in queso.

You can do this, babe.
I believe you can Guy.

to kiss this kiosk goodbye.

-A tortoise? Where?

20:33.233 --> 20:34.881
Uh-oh, and now there's just two.

20:34.901 --> 20:38.978
Wait, that is not fair. Who
wouldn't want to see a tortoise?

20:39.072 --> 20:40.721
I give up. I give up.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.574
Oh, wait a minute now, and
Ruthina Jean wins the kiosk.

20:43.726 --> 20:45.134

I-I won?

20:45.152 --> 20:47.078
Sweetie, what did you just do?

20:47.229 --> 20:48.471
This was your dream.

20:48.564 --> 20:49.896
Ruthina really needs this

20:49.916 --> 20:51.565
because a tree fell on
her husband, so I helped her,

20:51.584 --> 20:53.325
and that's the most
Guy Fieri thing I could do.

20:53.478 --> 20:54.735
