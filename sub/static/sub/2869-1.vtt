01:50.080 --> 01:51.580
That will make you think.

03:14.946 --> 03:17.623
Based on the novel 'Night train to Lisbon'

03:25.612 --> 03:28.320
Bern, Switzerland

03:38.027 --> 03:39.319
Stay there!

04:09.982 --> 04:10.982
Thank you.

04:20.314 --> 04:21.866
May I walk with you?

04:23.814 --> 04:24.772
Right.

04:33.563 --> 04:35.979
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.|Good morning,sir!

04:36.646 --> 04:39.021
We have a visitor... this morning.

04:42.520 --> 04:43.562
Eh, your coat...

04:48.895 --> 04:50.145
Perhaps... there

04:52.978 --> 04:56.394
I'm afraid there has been a slight mishap on the way here...

04:57.102 --> 05:00.196
I think the corrections will soon be legible.

05:00.810 --> 05:03.018
Max, would you do the honors?

05:04.268 --> 05:06.268
More work required there...

05:06.851 --> 05:11.559
'And no opportunity to honor and respect yourself.'

05:12.392 --> 05:17.517
But Marcus Aurelius was both a philosopher and an emperor.

05:17.683 --> 05:21.141
Which is no coincidence, that was the way with the Romans.

05:21.308 --> 05:24.599
Thought and action were all one.

05:24.808 --> 05:28.557
I think we were in chapter 12, page 42

05:41.598 --> 05:44.931
Er... Natalie, perhaps you begin?

05:45.764 --> 05:49.180
'How can it be that the gods...

05:50.222 --> 05:52.513
overlooked this along at some

05:52.680 --> 05:55.523
amongst men...

05:56.388 --> 05:59.096
... and those very good men,

05:59.387 --> 06:02.231
... who have had the most...

06:02.762 --> 06:05.137
intercourse with the divine.'

06:07.053 --> 06:08.772
please, keep on going.

06:50.090 --> 06:54.475
'If it is so that we only live a small part|of the life that is within us,

06:55.590 --> 06:57.923
What happens to the rest?'

07:09.588 --> 07:11.255
Hello, Dr. Gregorious.

07:11.547 --> 07:14.963
I'm afraid, your book on Persian grammar book hasn't yet arrived.

07:15.379 --> 07:18.837
No, that's not why I came...|Do you know that book?

07:19.504 --> 07:22.754
Indeed, I sold it to someone yesterday.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.045
A woman?

07:24.212 --> 07:27.670
Yes, she came in, asked for the Portuguese section

07:27.837 --> 07:30.253
found this book, sat there,

07:30.420 --> 07:33.628
read it for an hour or so, then became rather upset

07:33.794 --> 07:37.377
paid for the book and left.|How did you come by it?

07:37.711 --> 07:39.002
I found it.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.096
Beautiful title...

07:41.252 --> 07:43.627
'A Goldsmith of Words.'

07:50.792 --> 07:52.084
Train tickets...

07:53.251 --> 07:56.834
Where to?|- Lisbon, eventually.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.625
Leaving in 15 minutes.

08:02.791 --> 08:05.124
Thank you.|She was wearing that coat!

08:15.540 --> 08:16.925
Attention please,

08:17.123 --> 08:20.706
Line 10, pier 8 is now leaving

08:22.997 --> 08:24.789
What's all this noise?

08:27.039 --> 08:30.205
Where is mr. Gregorious?|He left, Mr. Kagi.

08:30.372 --> 08:31.413
He left?

08:32.163 --> 08:34.871
There was a woman with him here...

08:36.328 --> 08:37.621
Impossible.

09:15.867 --> 09:17.825
'We live here and now,'

09:18.200 --> 09:21.866
'Everything before and in other places is past '

09:22.033 --> 09:23.783
'and mostly forgotten.'

09:33.532 --> 09:36.209
This is Mr. Kagi, where are you?

09:38.323 --> 09:40.781
On a train...|A train?

09:41.698 --> 09:44.281
Where to?|Lisbon.

09:45.406 --> 09:48.530
Would you take care of my books?|I left them on my desk.

09:56.279 --> 09:59.123
'What could - what should be done,'

09:59.279 --> 10:01.904
'with all the time that lies ahead of us?'

10:02.154 --> 10:04.154
'Open and unshaped,'

10:04.362 --> 10:06.820
'featherlight in its freedom'

10:06.987 --> 10:10.111
'and lead-heavy in its uncertainty?'

10:11.111 --> 10:12.403
'Is it a wish'

10:13.486 --> 10:16.027
'dreamlike and nostalgic,'

10:16.194 --> 10:20.527
'to stand once again at that point in life,'

10:21.402 --> 10:25.110
'and be able to take a completely different direction'

10:25.485 --> 10:28.359
'to the one which has made us who we are?'

11:16.188 --> 11:17.521
Do you have a room?

11:19.229 --> 11:21.729
Where is your luggage?|I don't have any.

11:24.687 --> 11:26.687
I will trust you and give you a room.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.228
with a view of the sea.

11:37.352 --> 11:38.987
There... the sea.

11:42.352 --> 11:44.393
Anything else, sir?|Yes

11:45.476 --> 11:48.237
I want to find the address of the man who wrote this.

11:53.434 --> 11:54.684
Thank you.

11:56.142 --> 11:58.985
Anything else?|No, thank you.

12:37.388 --> 12:39.762
Good morning, I am looking for Amadeu de Prado.

12:41.304 --> 12:42.637
A moment.

13:00.302 --> 13:02.302
I believe you are looking for my brother?

13:02.718 --> 13:06.718
Yes, is the doctor in?|Are you ill?

13:07.468 --> 13:09.968
No, I'm... I'm reading this book.

13:10.176 --> 13:12.634
I very much like to meet him.

13:13.259 --> 13:16.967
What he writes touches me very deeply.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.977
You should come inside.

13:24.633 --> 13:26.216
You may sit.

13:27.341 --> 13:31.726
Some tea? Red Assam is Amadeu's preference.

13:36.423 --> 13:37.892
Tea, Clotilde.

13:39.215 --> 13:41.381
This is Amadeu's favorite room.

13:42.464 --> 13:43.850
It is beautiful though.

13:45.631 --> 13:47.922
He has read every one of those books.

13:52.921 --> 13:55.546
Does he still practice as a doctor?

13:56.796 --> 13:58.213
Where did you get it?

13:58.379 --> 14:01.504
I came across it in Bern; that's where I live.

14:02.087 --> 14:04.420
Only one hundred were ever printed.

14:04.879 --> 14:06.837
I have six copies left.

14:10.461 --> 14:13.503
Often wondered where the other ninety-four went...

14:17.211 --> 14:19.210
Bern is in Switzerland, is it not?

14:21.627 --> 14:25.418
Then the book has travelled.|That is a good thing.

14:29.084 --> 14:32.959
Has he written anything else?|Nothing that has been published.

14:34.167 --> 14:36.709
He wanted to be a writer, a philosopher...

14:38.458 --> 14:40.542
Then he decided to become a doctor;

14:40.916 --> 14:43.500
he didn't believe people should be in pain.

14:47.332 --> 14:49.666
Is that him?|That is our father

14:51.624 --> 14:54.832
He was a famous judge.|Yes, so I gathered from the book.

14:55.207 --> 14:58.540
He and Amadeu had a rather complicated relationship.

14:58.706 --> 15:03.164
'Considered from the standpoint of eternity,|that rather loses its significance...'

15:03.997 --> 15:05.247
Yes...

15:06.331 --> 15:10.549
He often said that to Amadeu.|Amadeu doesn't believe in eternity.

15:11.538 --> 15:13.205
Unfortunately not.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.746
I don't mean to pry, but ...

15:18.413 --> 15:21.704
may I ask how your father died?

15:22.079 --> 15:24.204
No, no; you may not.

15:29.786 --> 15:31.453
If you want to see Amadeu

15:32.244 --> 15:35.119
you will find him in the Prazeres Cemetery.

15:42.493 --> 15:45.170
'We leave something of ourselves behind'

15:45.451 --> 15:47.326
'only leave a place,'

15:48.909 --> 15:52.534
'we stay there even though we go away.'

15:54.034 --> 15:55.867
'And there are things in us'

15:56.409 --> 16:00.075
'that we can find again only by going back there.'

16:01.908 --> 16:05.199
'We travel to ourselves when we go to a place'

16:05.783 --> 16:08.199
'though we have covered a stretch of our life,'

16:09.324 --> 16:12.365
'no matter how brief it may have been.'

16:14.407 --> 16:19.073
'But by travelling to ourselves|we must confront our own loneliness.'

16:20.698 --> 16:23.073
'And isn't it so everything we do'

16:23.239 --> 16:25.822
'is done out of fear of loneliness?'

16:27.989 --> 16:29.905
'Isn't that why we renounce'

16:30.072 --> 16:33.655
'All the things we will regret at the end of our lives?'

16:40.112 --> 16:43.779
Excuse me, I am looking for Amadeu de Almeida Prado.

16:58.152 --> 17:00.610
' When dictatorship is a fact,

17:01.569 --> 17:04.527
revolution is a duty.'

17:23.400 --> 17:24.816
Bloody idiot!

17:42.106 --> 17:45.397
'Is it ultimately a question of self-image'

17:45.731 --> 17:48.605
' that determining idea one has made for oneselve of'

17:48.772 --> 17:51.730
'of what has to be accomplished and experienced'

17:51.938 --> 17:55.188
'so that one can approve the life one has lived?'

17:56.521 --> 17:58.240
' If this is the case,'

17:58.563 --> 18:00.896
'the fear of death might be described'

18:01.062 --> 18:05.562
' as the fear of not been able to become whom one planned to be.'

18:07.562 --> 18:09.811
'If the certainty befalls us'

18:09.978 --> 18:12.769
'that it will never be achieved... this homeness,'

18:12.936 --> 18:16.561
'you suddenly don't know how to live the time,'

18:16.727 --> 18:20.060
'that can no longer be part of a whole life.'

18:31.143 --> 18:32.267
Better?

18:34.309 --> 18:35.809
Or worse?

18:36.975 --> 18:38.225
Better.

18:38.392 --> 18:42.058
You feel as if you wrote the book yourself.|I would have liked it have done.

18:42.225 --> 18:46.224
He talks about everything that has preoccupied me for years.

18:46.849 --> 18:48.641
Better? Or worse?

18:49.849 --> 18:51.015
Worse.

18:52.307 --> 18:55.015
Tell me one of these beautiful sentences you read.

18:55.307 --> 18:59.525
'The real director of life is accident,'

19:00.056 --> 19:02.181
'a director full of cruelty'

19:02.348 --> 19:05.274
'compassion and bewitching charm.'

19:05.431 --> 19:07.097
By accident he means fate?

19:07.264 --> 19:10.555
No, I think he means chance, randomness chance.

19:11.305 --> 19:14.471
Let's take a break; rest your eyes for a moment.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.638
You're a man who doesn't sleep well...

19:17.804 --> 19:20.596
You can tell?|The eyes reveal everything.

19:22.804 --> 19:24.439
Look at these eyes.

19:25.554 --> 19:27.637
Tell me what they reveal.

19:28.345 --> 19:30.678
They melancholic, but hopeful

19:30.845 --> 19:34.219
tired, but persistent...  contradictory.

19:34.469 --> 19:38.136
Why would his sister pretend that he is still alive?

19:38.386 --> 19:40.844
I have no idea... Shall we resume?

19:50.468 --> 19:53.394
So you met a woman in a red coat who disappeared,

19:53.551 --> 19:56.342
and you just dropped everything?|And then I read the book.

19:57.384 --> 20:00.394
I would love to be able to do that: drop everything...

20:00.717 --> 20:03.883
You do that often?|No, I haven't done anything like that before.

20:04.466 --> 20:06.341
Better? Or worse?

20:06.591 --> 20:08.091
Er... better.

20:09.674 --> 20:11.674
How does that feel?

20:12.549 --> 20:14.798
You talk about seeing as feeling...

20:14.965 --> 20:16.840
Well, isn't it?|Suppose it is...

20:17.340 --> 20:20.100
How clear is it, the image?|Very clear.

20:21.714 --> 20:23.048
And how about this?

20:26.714 --> 20:28.380
Everything is in focus.

20:36.005 --> 20:38.463
Sir, we have this new one...

20:42.296 --> 20:44.379
'The decisive moments of life,'

20:44.545 --> 20:47.087
'when its direction changes forever,'

20:47.712 --> 20:50.555
'are not always marked by large and shown dramatics.'

20:51.711 --> 20:56.711
'In truth, the dramatic moments of a life determining experience,'

20:56.877 --> 20:59.752
'are often unbelieveable low key.'

21:00.960 --> 21:04.418
'When it unfolds its revolutionary effects'

21:04.585 --> 21:08.751
' and insures that a  life is revealed in a brand new light,'

21:08.918 --> 21:11.209
'it does that silently.'

21:12.542 --> 21:17.500
'And is this wonderful silence resides its special nobility.'

21:18.792 --> 21:21.208
Now you wonder if your pair were better...

21:21.416 --> 21:23.166
Yes...|But they're not, are they?

21:25.999 --> 21:28.166
No..., they feel very light.

21:28.416 --> 21:30.624
Getting used to them will take some time.

21:31.249 --> 21:35.498
Do you take Credit Cards?|Can can sort all that out with my receptionist.

21:36.582 --> 21:39.508
Before you go... I have an uncle.

21:40.248 --> 21:42.925
He lives in a nursing home across the barrio.

21:43.081 --> 21:46.039
I called him last night and told him about you and the book;

21:46.539 --> 21:48.580
He knew Amadeu de Prado well.

21:48.747 --> 21:52.705
I told him you want to know about Amadeu|and he said he talk to you.

21:53.330 --> 21:55.288
He was in the Resistance.

21:56.621 --> 21:59.912
I must warn you, my uncle can be difficult.

22:00.287 --> 22:01.756
In what way?

22:02.662 --> 22:05.995
The generation that lived under the dictator Salazar

22:06.162 --> 22:09.495
is still battling to come to terms with what happened.

22:10.203 --> 22:13.744
When the resistance began the Secret Police were extremely brutal;

22:13.911 --> 22:17.036
to this day people don't like talking about it,

22:17.411 --> 22:20.337
the perpetrators as well as their victims.

22:28.493 --> 22:30.128
Uncle João, how are you?

22:30.784 --> 22:32.253
What are you doing here?

22:32.701 --> 22:35.742
This is the man I was telling you about,|Raimund Gregorious, I brought him.

22:35.909 --> 22:38.117
I said he talked to him, not you

22:38.283 --> 22:41.616
You can wait in reception.|We get to the launch.

22:50.116 --> 22:53.407
So, you are interested in de Amadeu Prado?

22:56.073 --> 22:58.656
Mariana tells me you have a book he wrote?

22:58.823 --> 22:59.948
Want you like to see it?

23:00.115 --> 23:04.739
I can imigine what it is like, the godless priest.

23:06.114 --> 23:07.989
It's a good description...

23:09.239 --> 23:12.165
He was the only visit they allowed me in prison.

23:13.571 --> 23:15.446
Every week he visit,

23:15.696 --> 23:19.113
with books, medicines and cigarettes...

23:20.112 --> 23:23.779
which, of course, they take away the moment he leave.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.789
Yeah, he had privileges...

23:29.278 --> 23:32.819
What sort of privileges?|The kind you do not want in life.

23:35.153 --> 23:38.319
Do you  have cigarette?|No sorry, I don't smoke.

23:38.486 --> 23:39.485
Pity!

23:43.610 --> 23:48.568
Mariana tells me that you and Amadeu were in the Resistance.

23:48.859 --> 23:52.192
And Jorge, his best friend.|Yes, he writes a lot about Jorge.

23:52.442 --> 23:54.651
They were joined, in the heart and the soul.

23:55.359 --> 23:56.692
For a time...

23:57.067 --> 24:01.400
But Amadeu... he was too soft for the Resistance.

24:02.150 --> 24:05.691
He only joined because he felt guilty.

24:07.399 --> 24:10.649
Mariana tells me that you are from Switzerland?

24:10.816 --> 24:12.232
Yes, Bern.

24:13.482 --> 24:16.107
There was never a revolution in Switzerland, was there?

24:16.398 --> 24:20.939
No, somehow they always managed to avoid such things...

24:21.564 --> 24:24.408
They wouldn't know what is life to live without trusting

24:24.647 --> 24:28.439
never to trust your friends or family.

24:29.939 --> 24:32.865
I met his sister...  Adriana?

24:33.022 --> 24:36.230
she acts as if he's still alive.

24:37.021 --> 24:39.146
But she wears black, as if in mourning.

24:52.978 --> 24:55.988
You can only fill my cup halfway.

25:10.351 --> 25:13.226
No one has ever done that for me before.

25:31.099 --> 25:35.182
A gift from PIDE,|the Portuguese Secret Police.

25:37.348 --> 25:40.848
Rui Luís Mendez, was his name.

25:45.139 --> 25:46.556
in the springtime...

25:58.846 --> 26:00.096
I'm home!

26:09.886 --> 26:11.136
Who are you?

26:12.220 --> 26:13.344
Where is my wife?

26:13.761 --> 26:16.605
She kindly took her children for a walk.

26:19.052 --> 26:22.968
This woman that knows all the names... where do I find her?

26:23.760 --> 26:25.312
I do not know...

26:27.093 --> 26:29.426
I do not know who you are talking about.

26:32.801 --> 26:35.644
Your wife tells me  you are an excellent pianist.

26:36.884 --> 26:40.717
Will you play for me...  and my friends?

26:42.508 --> 26:43.758
Please?!

26:56.173 --> 26:57.725
Can I see your hands? Please?

27:24.295 --> 27:27.587
What should I play?|Play as you favour it.

27:43.293 --> 27:45.918
They say she has a photographic memory.

27:47.376 --> 27:48.845
Is that true?

28:07.124 --> 28:10.707
I'll ask you once more:|where is she?

28:31.872 --> 28:34.205
What make it all the more terrible

28:34.955 --> 28:36.871
was that some months earlier,

28:37.746 --> 28:41.746
Amadeu... he saved Mendes' life.

28:46.579 --> 28:51.120
Dinnertime... they serve us|early here, like in prison.

28:51.745 --> 28:55.286
Not for the inmates, you understand,|but for the staff.

28:57.202 --> 29:01.077
I'm glad he's finally been able to tell someone about it.

29:02.452 --> 29:04.618
I just wished it had been me.

29:05.452 --> 29:08.378
It is sometimes easier to speak with strangers.

29:09.618 --> 29:11.951
With my family it is a bit different.

29:12.159 --> 29:16.159
Pain is something we pretend happens to other people.

29:17.492 --> 29:19.408
When Uncle João disappeared,

29:19.575 --> 29:23.116
our parents told us he'd gone to Brazil to work.

29:23.491 --> 29:26.033
Then, after the Revolution, when he was released

29:26.199 --> 29:29.657
they told us he had an accident with his hands.

29:31.407 --> 29:34.084
He is very fond of you.|He is?

29:35.407 --> 29:37.990
Said you're the only one from the family that ever visits.

29:38.156 --> 29:40.833
He is always so grumpy, I don't blame the others.

29:41.781 --> 29:44.625
What else did he say?|He said he wished you were married.

29:45.864 --> 29:47.333
I hate him!

29:49.155 --> 29:51.572
Then, when you visited,|there be children.

29:52.947 --> 29:55.707
He actually said that? That he is fond of me?

30:01.446 --> 30:02.696
Do you have children?

30:04.737 --> 30:06.206
I have my students...

30:07.070 --> 30:10.278
But the faces change every year,|so I try not to get too fond of them.

30:31.443 --> 30:33.526
I think you are going to stay another day?!

30:35.442 --> 30:37.077
Yes, I might have to.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.786
Nice glasses.

31:31.811 --> 31:33.363
Father Bartholomeo?

31:35.728 --> 31:40.560
João Eça told me that you buried Amadeu de Prado.

31:42.102 --> 31:44.018
I would prefer to be remembered as the man

31:44.185 --> 31:46.685
who taught Amadeu

31:47.143 --> 31:49.101
not the one who buried him.

31:51.601 --> 31:54.007
Amadeu was twelve years old when he first came to this school.

31:55.517 --> 31:58.277
He came with no bags, no books

31:58.809 --> 32:00.683
He had read them all, you see.

32:01.058 --> 32:03.016
Everything was in his head.

32:04.683 --> 32:08.641
What does he say about this school in his book?

32:17.098 --> 32:19.431
'For 1922 days'

32:19.598 --> 32:23.389
'I attended  Balissio where my Father sent me,'

32:23.598 --> 32:26.222
'the strictest school in the whole country.'

32:26.639 --> 32:29.264
'By the third day I realized that I had to count the days'

32:29.430 --> 32:31.430
'so as not to be crushed by them.'

32:33.722 --> 32:35.253
He...  hated it that much?

32:38.763 --> 32:41.804
Were George and Amadeu in the same class?

32:42.221 --> 32:43.939
Er no, not at first,

32:44.095 --> 32:48.553
But Amadeu skipped two grades;

32:49.803 --> 32:51.803
he was that bright, you see,

32:52.178 --> 32:54.803
and for two years they were in the same class.

32:54.969 --> 32:55.876
Or I should say: they were in a class of their own.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.510
Amadeu, the aristocrat,

33:01.094 --> 33:03.094
and George, the working class boy.

33:03.552 --> 33:06.843
They had a very naughty curiosity,|those two...

33:07.760 --> 33:09.478
They would lie to their mothers,

33:09.634 --> 33:12.759
that they were going to spend the night in a friends house,

33:13.259 --> 33:15.342
and instead they came here.

33:24.883 --> 33:26.435
How did you find them, George?

33:26.591 --> 33:29.601
I was sleeping here, then I found that the floor was loose.

33:32.715 --> 33:35.090
Jean-Paul Sartre...|Karl Marx...

33:35.632 --> 33:36.496
Henry Miller...

33:37.798 --> 33:39.715
My god, if they found these books...

33:39.881 --> 33:43.089
We will end up in Tarrafal,|along with all the other political prisoners.

33:44.631 --> 33:46.214
But your father would never allowed that, would he, Amadeu?

33:47.589 --> 33:49.922
He would get prime minister Salazar to personally intervene

33:50.089 --> 33:51.838
and have the case thrown out of court.

33:52.963 --> 33:55.046
You think it's a joke that my father is a judge...

33:55.421 --> 33:57.119
I think it's a joke that the son of a greengrocer|is friends with the son of a judge.

33:59.588 --> 34:00.973
That is funny.

34:03.129 --> 34:04.462
You have to admit!

34:08.337 --> 34:12.795
Amadeu would have been unhappy wherever he was.

34:14.585 --> 34:16.918
He never played games with the other boys,

34:18.418 --> 34:20.335
he never let himself go...

34:21.877 --> 34:23.960
Except one time.

34:27.293 --> 34:29.969
Nobody forgot that time.

34:33.458 --> 34:35.094
Make room there, boys. Make room.

34:55.581 --> 34:58.425
My father is here.|Of course he is here. What did you expect?

34:58.581 --> 34:58.988
You should read thou this,|wrote most of...

34:58.998 --> 35:00.467
You should read this George,|you wrote most of it anyway.

35:00.623 --> 35:03.248
They are your words,|I only helped to choose them.

35:04.789 --> 35:08.164
Amadeu, what is our religion?|Loyalty.

35:08.372 --> 35:09.789
What are our values?

35:10.497 --> 35:12.538
Truth above all us.

35:12.872 --> 35:15.330
Exactly, just keep your eyes on me and you'll be fine.

35:18.454 --> 35:19.611
As is traditional

35:20.038 --> 35:24.089
we end our ceremony with a grade 12 graduation speech

35:24.412 --> 35:27.089
In this year, that honor will be bestowed to

35:27.620 --> 35:30.870
Amadeu de Almeida Prado.

35:59.617 --> 36:02.033
I would not like to live in a world without cathedrals.

36:03.325 --> 36:04.741
I need their beauty and grandeur

36:04.908 --> 36:07.283
against the dirty color of military uniforms.

36:10.407 --> 36:12.615
I love the powerful words of the Bible.

36:14.115 --> 36:16.198
I need the force of its poetry.

36:17.407 --> 36:20.250
I need it against the decay of language

36:20.406 --> 36:23.448
and the dictatorship of worthless slogans.

36:26.947 --> 36:29.155
But there is another world I do not wish to live in,

36:31.322 --> 36:34.113
a world in which independent thinking is despised

36:34.738 --> 36:37.904
and the finest things we can experience denounced as sin.

36:38.696 --> 36:40.446
A world in which our love

36:40.779 --> 36:44.779
Is demanded by tyrants, oppressors and assassins.

36:46.029 --> 36:49.278
And most absurdly: people are exhorted from the pulpit

36:49.695 --> 36:53.528
to forgive these creatures and even to love them.

36:55.278 --> 36:58.486
It is for this reason we cannot just put the bible aside.

36:59.152 --> 37:01.110
We have to throw it away completely:

37:01.277 --> 37:04.870
there it speaks only of a void,|hollower than our god.

37:06.776 --> 37:10.026
In his omnipresence the Lord observes us day and night.

37:10.818 --> 37:13.109
He takes note of our acts and thoughts

37:13.651 --> 37:16.192
But what is a man without secrets?

37:17.067 --> 37:20.025
Without thoughts and wishes that he and he alone knows?

37:21.567 --> 37:23.400
Does the Lord our God not consider

37:23.566 --> 37:26.149
he's stealing our soul with His unbridled curiosity?

37:26.441 --> 37:28.858
A soul that should be immortal?

37:30.524 --> 37:33.315
But who would in all seriouness want to be immortal?

37:34.065 --> 37:36.232
How boring to know that what happens today,

37:36.440 --> 37:38.815
this month, this year, does not matter?

37:39.648 --> 37:41.148
Nothing would count.

37:42.439 --> 37:45.481
No one here knows what it would be like to live eternally.

37:45.939 --> 37:48.022
And it is a blessing we never will.

37:49.397 --> 37:51.230
One thing I can assure you:

37:51.855 --> 37:55.907
It would be hell, this endless paradise of immortality.

37:56.896 --> 37:58.813
It is death, and only death,

37:59.313 --> 38:02.562
That gives each moment beauty and horror.

38:03.146 --> 38:05.697
Only through death is time a living thing.

38:06.604 --> 38:08.322
Why does the Lord does not know this?

38:08.895 --> 38:11.311
why does He threaten us with an endlessness

38:11.478 --> 38:14.019
that can only be unbearably desolate?

38:19.769 --> 38:22.144
I don't want to live in a world without cathedrals...

38:22.977 --> 38:24.695
I need the lustre of their windows,

38:25.852 --> 38:29.560
their cool stillness, their imperious silence.

38:30.809 --> 38:35.028
I need the holiness of words, the grandeur of the great poetry.

38:35.767 --> 38:40.152
But just as much I need the freedom to rebel

38:40.308 --> 38:42.600
against everything that is cruel in this world.

38:43.350 --> 38:45.683
For the one  is nothing without the other.

38:46.266 --> 38:48.266
And no one forcing me to choose.

39:33.678 --> 39:34.886
What did you think?

39:36.761 --> 39:40.552
I thought you would deliver a speech in Latin.

39:42.427 --> 39:45.010
Then only a very few would have understood it.

39:55.676 --> 39:57.425
Are you friends with that boy?

39:58.509 --> 40:00.342
We are the best of friends.

40:06.383 --> 40:08.216
All of those faces, and more

40:10.216 --> 40:12.299
came to his funeral.

40:12.715 --> 40:15.340
He died on the day of the Revolution

40:16.382 --> 40:19.715
and so they brought all red carnations.

40:21.298 --> 40:24.756
I dared not speak any words about God

40:25.006 --> 40:29.349
as what Amadeu called: 'His empty promises.'

40:30.339 --> 40:32.130
But I did allow myself

40:33.047 --> 40:35.463
one religious word.

40:37.880 --> 40:39.171
Amen.

40:54.669 --> 40:56.794
I was very proud of him...

40:58.127 --> 41:00.627
So why did you never tell him, papa?

41:44.831 --> 41:49.497
To this day I never found out what secret bound those two together,

41:50.914 --> 41:53.674
and what it had to do with Amadeu.

42:03.204 --> 42:05.745
My brother is not here.|I know.

42:07.245 --> 42:08.412
Go away.

42:08.578 --> 42:10.193
I know what happened,|had an aneurysm.

42:10.203 --> 42:11.161
I know what happened,|he had an aneurysm.

42:12.870 --> 42:14.338
It's in the book.

42:16.244 --> 42:20.910
How do you live with that: knowing that at any time|a bloodvessel could burst,

42:21.452 --> 42:23.993
flooding your brain with blood?

42:25.285 --> 42:28.451
I only found out after, once I discovered his writings.

42:30.701 --> 42:32.545
He never told anyone.

42:33.742 --> 42:35.378
Not even me.

42:35.534 --> 42:38.992
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you.

42:40.200 --> 42:41.533
No, wait.

42:44.158 --> 42:46.033
Let me show you where we worked.

42:56.282 --> 42:58.157
People came day and night

42:59.490 --> 43:00.906
to see him.

43:02.198 --> 43:03.583
To be healed.

43:05.656 --> 43:08.614
No one should be in pain, he always used to say.

43:09.780 --> 43:11.905
The door was always open.

43:15.571 --> 43:17.321
I met João Eça.

43:19.613 --> 43:23.446
He mentioned me that Amadeu was in the Resistance.

43:25.029 --> 43:26.779
Resistance...

43:30.112 --> 43:33.653
And that he saved Mendes' life.

43:41.444 --> 43:44.485
It was late in the evening.

43:48.151 --> 43:50.110
There were terrible shouts,

43:51.609 --> 43:53.276
across the square.

43:54.776 --> 43:56.026
Murderer!

44:06.774 --> 44:07.983
The Police!

44:18.398 --> 44:19.784
We need help!

44:25.981 --> 44:27.533
Get the doctor.

44:29.855 --> 44:31.189
In there.

44:39.271 --> 44:41.729
Amadeu, you need to come. Now!

44:52.853 --> 44:54.020
Is this...?

45:02.435 --> 45:04.810
Out. Out!

45:22.725 --> 45:23.891
Adrenaline.

46:17.094 --> 46:19.344
He is a traitor. Traitor!

46:23.969 --> 46:25.760
You're a traitor!|I'm a doctor.

46:28.093 --> 46:29.760
You hear me? A doctor!

46:30.343 --> 46:32.551
You are a traitor!

47:01.131 --> 47:04.964
sat him down in this fluid chair|and washed his face,

47:06.089 --> 47:07.839
His beautiful face.

47:09.630 --> 47:13.338
After that, people stopped coming; even Jorge.

47:13.713 --> 47:15.297
That really hurt him.

47:17.880 --> 47:21.056
Do you know of Jorge?|I know they were great friends.

47:23.254 --> 47:26.504
Why is the world so cruel?|I often ask myself that.

47:26.670 --> 47:30.170
It is if it doesn't care.|God doesn't carer.

47:31.961 --> 47:34.003
Amadeu was right about that.

47:37.794 --> 47:39.752
I would like to be alone now.

47:42.169 --> 47:44.929
May I call on you again?|Why?

47:47.335 --> 47:50.262
His life, his world, was...

47:52.168 --> 47:55.626
extraordinary.|Makes mine seem so insignificant.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.876
Do you have cigarettes?|Which brand?

48:26.392 --> 48:27.517
You brought them?

48:28.101 --> 48:32.521
No, no wait, every one here is a spy,|worse than the damned fascists.

48:32.854 --> 48:34.241
We go outside.

48:37.191 --> 48:39.484
You didn't telephone me just to get cigarettes?

48:39.651 --> 48:43.747
I called because talking to you made me sleep better last night.

48:48.823 --> 48:52.326
Amadeu, he never smoked, he was the only one who didn't.

48:53.118 --> 48:55.370
Jorge, he smoked like a chimney.

49:09.296 --> 49:12.881
Jorge..., is he still alive?|I do not know.

49:14.966 --> 49:19.761
I never talked to him after what happened with Stephania.

49:25.807 --> 49:27.443
Who is Stephania?

49:28.642 --> 49:31.060
A woman who remembers everything.

49:31.686 --> 49:35.188
That's why they picked me up.|To get to her.

49:37.982 --> 49:40.358
Lieutenant Nicholas Ribeiro.

49:42.402 --> 49:46.154
Benfica,  Decemberstreet 28.

49:46.905 --> 49:51.741
Phone, 8572463.

49:53.492 --> 49:55.494
7th Army Division.

49:59.455 --> 50:01.665
Captain Charles Fish.

50:03.708 --> 50:06.585
Sintra, 47 street...

50:24.013 --> 50:25.222
It is Amadeu Prado.

50:27.307 --> 50:30.069
Jorge, are you in there?|Let him in.

50:42.317 --> 50:43.985
Why have you been avoiding me?

50:44.444 --> 50:46.695
Every one else I can understand, but you?

50:47.112 --> 50:48.363
I am not avoiding you.

50:49.113 --> 50:51.959
You're lying, Jorge. And we do not lie to each other!

51:05.625 --> 51:07.418
I want to join the Resistance.

51:08.377 --> 51:10.044
Because of guilt?

51:12.004 --> 51:14.047
As a doctor, I had no choice.

51:14.214 --> 51:17.549
As a doctor you should have had injected poison into the heart,

51:18.175 --> 51:19.728
not adrenaline.

51:25.805 --> 51:27.098
Sit, Amadeu.

51:37.772 --> 51:39.773
Aren't you going to introduce me your friends?

51:40.649 --> 51:41.899
This is João.

51:45.485 --> 51:48.112
And this is Stephania.

51:51.031 --> 51:52.750
I was going to introduce you sooner, but...

51:52.907 --> 51:55.409
But the Resistance keeps us busy.

51:56.618 --> 51:58.171
Isn't she beautiful?

52:07.959 --> 52:11.211
What if your first asset was to kill your father?

52:21.093 --> 52:23.344
Why?|Because he is a judge.

52:25.220 --> 52:27.263
Part of the fascist regime.

52:39.772 --> 52:43.910
Don't be upset, Amadeu..., I was just testing you.

52:46.902 --> 52:50.821
You knew it strangely why,|-even Jorge could see it-

52:51.905 --> 52:56.127
that Stefania was completely drawn to him.

52:59.285 --> 53:01.078
And the names and addresses?

53:01.245 --> 53:05.331
Members of the armed forces|sympathetic to our cause.

53:05.498 --> 53:08.125
She had them stockpiled in her head

53:08.583 --> 53:10.626
more than two hundred names,

53:11.168 --> 53:16.464
waiting for the day we call them|to ride up against the fascists.

53:37.186 --> 53:38.770
Can I have my key, please?

54:05.413 --> 54:07.050
Is mrs. Prado at home?

54:07.206 --> 54:09.791
She askes for you to wait, if I could.

54:21.383 --> 54:23.342
Why you bring back the past?

54:24.718 --> 54:27.845
I want to know how it felt to be Amadeu.

54:29.722 --> 54:30.889
Did you know him?

54:40.020 --> 54:41.897
Amadeu, you must eat.

54:42.856 --> 54:46.149
You need to be strong for your final exams.

55:06.872 --> 55:07.914
Stand up.

55:15.169 --> 55:16.253
Sit down.

55:16.503 --> 55:17.838
Mama, come help me.

55:22.549 --> 55:24.467
I have to do this, otherwise you will die.

55:25.426 --> 55:26.719
Take your hands away.

55:28.678 --> 55:30.430
Adriana, trust me.

56:02.034 --> 56:03.911
Clotilde! Call an ambulance.

56:05.870 --> 56:08.372
The ambulance and the doctor came.

56:08.914 --> 56:10.999
and Adriana was rushed to the hospital.

56:18.379 --> 56:20.297
You can leave us now, Clotilde.

56:31.221 --> 56:33.097
The doctor said I did the right thing.

56:39.935 --> 56:41.572
Why do you say nothing?

56:43.646 --> 56:45.522
Why do you judge me so?

56:52.652 --> 56:54.737
The intervention is called tracheotomy.

56:55.362 --> 56:58.291
If I had not done you've would have carried her out in a coffin.

57:05.202 --> 57:07.495
I too shall have a cup of tea, Clotilde.

57:10.914 --> 57:12.384
So, now you know...

57:14.292 --> 57:17.252
From then on I was indebted to him.

57:18.461 --> 57:21.005
Just as Joaqui Mendes. was indebted to him

57:23.381 --> 57:25.049
The police knew very well

57:25.216 --> 57:26.936
that the clinic was used as a cover for the resistance,

57:27.092 --> 57:29.427
but they never came and searched.

57:29.886 --> 57:32.179
People would drop off envelopes with money

57:32.638 --> 57:35.098
names, addresses, maps...

57:38.225 --> 57:40.101
And then she would come.

57:43.061 --> 57:44.448
Next.

57:47.356 --> 57:50.035
Why have you not called me?|I left messages.

57:51.859 --> 57:53.777
I have something for João.

57:59.948 --> 58:03.325
I have to talk to you,|I cannot go on with Jorge.

58:05.660 --> 58:06.911
Leave us.

58:10.455 --> 58:11.925
Adriana, leave us.

58:15.834 --> 58:17.960
Then one night, it all ended.

58:19.127 --> 58:20.212
How?

58:20.628 --> 58:22.130
Something had happened...

58:22.296 --> 58:26.685
I don't know what, but it was the last time I ever saw her.

58:36.181 --> 58:39.026
There are patients waiting for you.|Send them away.

58:39.183 --> 58:40.903
You do not send patients away!

58:41.059 --> 58:43.988
Do it now! And if someone comes to the door do not answer it.

58:44.812 --> 58:46.688
Switch off the lights, we're not here.

59:26.632 --> 59:28.466
João Eça is at the door.

59:30.426 --> 59:31.552
I'll be back.

59:43.351 --> 59:44.560
Come, come in.

59:49.022 --> 59:50.356
Where is she?

59:52.316 --> 59:53.650
Stefania?

59:53.817 --> 59:56.318
I don't know, she went one way or went another.

59:57.736 --> 01:00:01.322
Jorge came to me; the problem is Stephania.

01:00:02.656 --> 01:00:04.126
What do you mean?

01:00:05.116 --> 01:00:08.129
He wants... wants to eliminate her.

01:00:09.786 --> 01:00:10.912
What?

01:00:12.621 --> 01:00:15.873
He says if they get to her, they all get the names.

01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:18.834
It will be the end of it.

01:00:19.584 --> 01:00:21.586
Jorge wants to kill Stephania?

01:00:22.336 --> 01:00:25.672
If she or Jorge comes here,|call me.

01:00:26.839 --> 01:00:29.549
You understand?|I understand.

01:00:36.304 --> 01:00:37.597
What a mess...

01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:52.815
What are you going to do?

01:00:55.859 --> 01:00:58.652
Pack a bag and some food;|I am taking the car.

01:00:58.861 --> 01:01:01.363
To where?|Away from here.

01:01:03.906 --> 01:01:06.835
With her?|Of course with her.

01:01:08.159 --> 01:01:10.410
No, please, no Amadeu!

01:01:11.119 --> 01:01:13.079
I beg you, don't do this thing!

01:01:13.913 --> 01:01:15.549
Tell them she's here,

01:01:15.956 --> 01:01:19.083
don't go away with her, I beg you!

01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:21.710
Please don't go!

01:01:26.046 --> 01:01:27.547
Do as I say.

01:01:30.174 --> 01:01:32.509
Don't do this thing, it is wrong!

01:01:33.593 --> 01:01:37.012
Something terrible will happen, I know it will!

01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:46.268
He stepped over me.|I will never forget that.

01:01:47.769 --> 01:01:49.520
He stepped me over,

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:53.825
like I was... nothing.

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.932
Could I have a coffee, please?

01:02:45.767 --> 01:02:47.768
Mr. Kagi, It's me.

01:02:48.394 --> 01:02:50.979
I'm sorry I missed your call yesterday.

01:02:51.229 --> 01:02:53.105
Don't tell you're still in Lisbon?

01:02:54.023 --> 01:02:55.940
Yes, I am.|Where are you staying?

01:02:56.149 --> 01:02:58.911
In Hotel Silva.|You wouldn't have heard of it.

01:02:59.068 --> 01:03:00.621
Is it raining in Bern?

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:03.029
I can't keep teaching your class;|you'll have to come back.

01:03:03.821 --> 01:03:06.698
If you don't come back I'm going to have to|find a replacement for you.

01:03:06.865 --> 01:03:08.199
You want me to do that?

01:03:08.783 --> 01:03:11.910
Perhaps...|I need a yes or no, Raimund.

01:03:12.368 --> 01:03:14.453
Mr. Kagi, I have to go. I'm sorry.

01:04:33.548 --> 01:04:35.466
Why are you following me?

01:04:47.058 --> 01:04:48.694
Where does this come from?

01:04:48.892 --> 01:04:51.571
His sister, Adriana, came across his notes

01:04:52.186 --> 01:04:55.730
And she put them together in a book;|I came across that in Bern, Switzerland.

01:04:59.441 --> 01:05:01.651
I want to know what happened to Stephania.

01:05:01.818 --> 01:05:03.902
Why?|Amadeu is dead.

01:05:04.903 --> 01:05:07.405
Adriana doesn't know;|you're the only one who does.

01:05:07.863 --> 01:05:09.823
Get the hell out of here!

01:05:10.365 --> 01:05:11.616
Get out!

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.746
Why has  my uncle started smoking again?

01:05:21.664 --> 01:05:23.624
The doctor from the nursing home called me

01:05:23.791 --> 01:05:27.085
a stranger had visited him and brought him some cigarettes.

01:05:27.335 --> 01:05:29.920
Well, he asked me for some...|Are you trying to kill him?

01:05:30.671 --> 01:05:32.390
He already has emphysema!

01:05:32.547 --> 01:05:34.882
Yeah, but he enjoys smoking;|why deny him that pleasure?

01:05:35.049 --> 01:05:36.518
Because it's bad for him.

01:05:36.675 --> 01:05:40.552
So is living in that nursing home. It reminds him of being in prison.

01:05:44.889 --> 01:05:47.901
How are your new glasses?|I'm getting used to them...

01:05:49.683 --> 01:05:51.351
Would you have dinner with me?

01:05:56.021 --> 01:05:57.658
I thought you never ask...

01:05:59.315 --> 01:06:02.275
If Jesus had been put to deatb with a guillotine

01:06:02.442 --> 01:06:05.236
we all be praying for a big, shiny blade.

01:06:05.653 --> 01:06:09.707
Or if he'd been electrocuted|we've bent effectually in front of a chair.

01:06:13.533 --> 01:06:15.201
But can you really do that

01:06:15.368 --> 01:06:19.506
nobody is like to be another person, without being the other person?

01:06:19.662 --> 01:06:23.456
Well, you can imagine|what it is like to be that other person.

01:06:24.165 --> 01:06:27.793
'Imagination is our last sanctuary,'|that's one of his lines.

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:31.837
Where he also said: 'Intimacy is our last sanctuary.'

01:06:33.046 --> 01:06:34.964
You remember the lines from bottom?

01:06:35.214 --> 01:06:37.841
That's because they mean  something to me.

01:06:38.383 --> 01:06:41.479
Poor Stephania, she remembered everything,

01:06:41.635 --> 01:06:43.887
even trivial things, I menan numbers, names,

01:06:44.054 --> 01:06:46.347
phone numbers, addresses...

01:06:46.806 --> 01:06:49.141
To have a memory like that|must driving mad.

01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:52.903
Sorry, I'm going on.

01:06:54.728 --> 01:06:56.604
I haven't talk as much as this for years.

01:06:56.979 --> 01:06:59.606
No, I'm fascinated...

01:07:02.608 --> 01:07:05.985
May I ask you how long youhave been alone?

01:07:07.028 --> 01:07:08.664
Five and a half years.

01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:11.531
But before that,|you spoke to your wife?

01:07:11.739 --> 01:07:13.126
Yes...

01:07:15.533 --> 01:07:17.618
For the usual landed me in trouble.

01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:19.244
What kind of trouble?

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:22.038
Well, we throw a party for our colleagues...

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:24.289
Our friends.

01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:28.094
And she found this quote, from Pessoa:

01:07:30.002 --> 01:07:33.796
'Fields are greener in their description

01:07:34.129 --> 01:07:36.339
than in their actual greenness'.

01:07:36.923 --> 01:07:39.091
And somebody said: oh, that's a beautiful sentence; and I said:

01:07:39.258 --> 01:07:42.635
Yes, only a very few people will ever understand it.

01:07:44.095 --> 01:07:49.098
There was a terrible silence,|and then she said, my wife,

01:07:50.182 --> 01:07:54.685
She said: and I suppose you are one of the chosen few?

01:07:57.729 --> 01:08:00.105
So, that was the end of that party...

01:08:02.065 --> 01:08:03.535
But you were right.

01:08:03.691 --> 01:08:08.278
Yeah, but it was arrogant.|Stupid and arrogant.

01:08:08.903 --> 01:08:11.999
And is that why she left you,|because of your arrogance?

01:08:12.155 --> 01:08:16.658
No, I think she left me, because she found me...

01:08:19.243 --> 01:08:20.493
boring.

01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:29.082
Funny we still in touch,|she called the other day,

01:08:29.667 --> 01:08:31.919
she wanted me to move my books out of the garage,

01:08:32.085 --> 01:08:34.796
because her new boyfriend wanted somewhere to park his car...

01:08:37.798 --> 01:08:39.881
Don't know why I'm telling you all this.

01:08:47.554 --> 01:08:50.848
Would you like to dance?|No, I can't, I can't dance.

01:08:54.059 --> 01:08:55.184
You see?

01:08:56.685 --> 01:08:57.895
Boring.

01:09:05.983 --> 01:09:07.193
Thank you.

01:09:08.652 --> 01:09:10.037
I enjoyed that.

01:09:10.194 --> 01:09:13.572
Raimund, you are not boring.

01:09:16.491 --> 01:09:18.783
My uncle would like to see you again.

01:09:19.533 --> 01:09:21.452
Would you take him some cigarettes?

01:09:43.466 --> 01:09:45.844
Jorge is still alive.|You may see him?

01:09:46.261 --> 01:09:48.179
Still running the same pharmacy.

01:09:48.345 --> 01:09:50.764
Smoking cigarettes while he serves his customers.

01:09:51.805 --> 01:09:54.265
You brought some?|Yes, I did.

01:09:57.352 --> 01:10:00.448
Stefania was in the house when I was there?

01:10:00.604 --> 01:10:02.814
She found them together in his study.

01:10:04.482 --> 01:10:06.650
No wonder he lied to me.

01:10:06.816 --> 01:10:11.945
Because, you know, he never lied,|he couldn't tolerate dishonesty.

01:10:12.529 --> 01:10:15.114
What had  happened earlier that night?

01:10:15.531 --> 01:10:18.491
Jorges place become too small,

01:10:18.658 --> 01:10:23.703
so we hired a room in an old warehouse where|our meetings.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:30.082
We pretend it was a literacy class; Stefanias idea.

01:10:31.959 --> 01:10:33.512
We were so naive...

01:10:33.876 --> 01:10:36.086
Nuno, you be in charge of the railways.

01:10:36.253 --> 01:10:37.838
The numbers you will call:

01:10:38.004 --> 01:10:43.174
Lisbon, 6423518,

01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:45.218
contact name: Leonardo;

01:10:45.509 --> 01:10:51.222
Port, 355900,|contact name: Julius.

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:55.850
The sign for take over will come from Radio Renaissance;

01:10:56.017 --> 01:10:59.144
It will be the song that was banned; the song by...

01:11:06.524 --> 01:11:10.360
Excuse me, are you lost?|This is the literacy class?

01:11:11.235 --> 01:11:14.863
Yes, we were just finishing;|please, take a seat.

01:11:18.949 --> 01:11:25.453
Most letters have more than one pronunciation|except the letter: X.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.966
But I will explain that meaning what it tells next week.

01:11:29.414 --> 01:11:30.999
Thank you all.

01:11:36.502 --> 01:11:39.296
What is a professor of music doing here?

01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:43.966
I met someone who cannot read.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.135
and wanted to see for myself what kind of course it was,

01:11:48.302 --> 01:11:50.554
before recommending it.

01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:54.723
And what is this persons name?

01:11:57.767 --> 01:11:58.893
Carlos Pinto.

01:12:00.394 --> 01:12:02.186
How original...

01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:06.523
Sit down, all of you!|Nobody leaves this room!

01:12:21.908 --> 01:12:23.326
Out, out!

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:00.351
João, give me your gun.

01:13:01.185 --> 01:13:02.352
What for?

01:13:02.728 --> 01:13:05.229
We have to do what is right for the Resistance.

01:13:06.397 --> 01:13:09.440
What happened to the others?|Stafania and Amadeu they got away.

01:13:09.983 --> 01:13:12.484
But they gonna find her, and then she will talk.

01:13:13.944 --> 01:13:17.738
The others they don't know much,|but Stephania, she knows everything.

01:13:19.989 --> 01:13:21.866
Jorge, what are you talking about?

01:13:23.158 --> 01:13:25.034
You want to kill Stephania?

01:13:27.453 --> 01:13:29.871
No, no, I do not want, but I have to.

01:13:30.747 --> 01:13:34.082
One life for many lives.|Give it to me.

01:13:35.792 --> 01:13:37.376
João, give it to me.

01:13:40.086 --> 01:13:43.047
I never found out what really happened...

01:13:43.839 --> 01:13:45.131
He tell you?

01:13:45.298 --> 01:13:49.259
No, when I asked him,|he told me to get lost.

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:56.525
I need to know, I can't tell you how many times I wish

01:13:56.681 --> 01:13:59.266
I never give him that gun.

01:14:03.394 --> 01:14:07.271
Three days later, Mendes, he picked me up.

01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:12.733
He broke my hands and my spirit,

01:14:13.734 --> 01:14:17.278
but I never give him one single name.

01:14:18.904 --> 01:14:23.407
You tell that to Jorge,|that he owes me.

01:14:28.869 --> 01:14:32.205
'In youth, we live as if we were immortal.

01:14:33.039 --> 01:14:35.885
'Knowledge of mortality dances around us'

01:14:36.041 --> 01:14:39.752
'like a brittle paper ribbon that barely touches our skin.'

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:44.630
'When, in life does that change?'

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:48.341
'When does the ribbon tighten,

01:14:48.966 --> 01:14:51.927
'until finally it strangles us?'

01:15:01.642 --> 01:15:02.934
Mr. Kagi?

01:15:03.435 --> 01:15:05.311
Have you made a decision yet?

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.564
No.

01:15:09.939 --> 01:15:14.567
A woman came asking for you...|She said she met you on a bridge or something?

01:15:15.776 --> 01:15:17.361
A Portuguese woman?

01:15:17.778 --> 01:15:19.946
I told her where you were and she left.

01:15:20.655 --> 01:15:23.073
If you decide not to come back|I need your keys;

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.325
will you post them to me?|No, this woman...

01:15:27.159 --> 01:15:28.712
did she leave her name?

01:15:29.202 --> 01:15:30.286
No.

01:15:31.037 --> 01:15:32.506
Goodbye, Mr. Kagi.

01:16:08.979 --> 01:16:11.397
João Eça wants to know  what happened to Stephania.

01:16:13.065 --> 01:16:14.566
He says you owe him.

01:16:14.733 --> 01:16:17.193
I owe no one anything.

01:16:22.071 --> 01:16:24.031
You know what they did to his hands?

01:16:26.324 --> 01:16:29.952
Those hands that used to play Mozart?|He didn't give them one name.

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:32.995
If he had, you would not be standing here.

01:16:33.162 --> 01:16:36.498
You think, you can blackmail me with guilt?

01:16:36.665 --> 01:16:39.125
You don't know who you're dealing with!

01:16:42.252 --> 01:16:46.254
Could I have killed her?|That is the  question!

01:16:50.382 --> 01:16:54.385
Don't you know we don't talk about the Resistance here?

01:16:54.593 --> 01:16:58.012
We bury our history and move on!

01:17:02.682 --> 01:17:04.183
You want a drink?

01:17:10.271 --> 01:17:13.033
we're sitting where Amadeu used to sit.

01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:16.118
Until the thing with Mendes happened, then we...

01:17:19.819 --> 01:17:22.029
we had a list of reasons for loyalty:

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:24.989
guilt towards others

01:17:26.198 --> 01:17:29.450
shared suffering, common struggle, common strenght,

01:17:29.659 --> 01:17:32.786
weaknesss, need for closeness,

01:17:34.412 --> 01:17:37.091
common hatred, shared  humor, and so on...

01:17:40.166 --> 01:17:42.845
What about love?|He didn't believe in it.

01:17:43.001 --> 01:17:45.503
avoided the word as too sentimental.

01:17:45.753 --> 01:17:47.796
There were only three things that were important to him:

01:17:49.047 --> 01:17:51.893
desire, pleasure and security.

01:17:53.675 --> 01:17:55.093
Desire...

01:17:58.512 --> 01:18:01.014
I don't trust people who don't drink.

01:18:09.769 --> 01:18:11.187
Have a cigarette.

01:18:28.574 --> 01:18:29.783
you're okay?

01:18:33.285 --> 01:18:36.162
João still loves to smoke.|He would.

01:18:42.708 --> 01:18:46.378
The night we graduated from the University of Coimbra

01:18:46.544 --> 01:18:49.672
Me as a pharmacist,|Amadeu as a doctor...

01:18:57.177 --> 01:19:00.304
What?|Come, I have something to show you.

01:19:17.232 --> 01:19:18.483
What do you think?

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.403
So? It is a pharmacy...

01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:25.821
Yes... It's yours.

01:19:31.992 --> 01:19:33.159
Come in.

01:19:41.749 --> 01:19:44.917
I need a pharmacist I can trust|if I'm going to be writing prescriptions.

01:19:46.377 --> 01:19:47.544
Here.

01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:57.509
I could not believe what he had given me.

01:20:00.053 --> 01:20:03.972
After that I never thought we could loose our friendship.

01:20:06.807 --> 01:20:08.934
I never thought it possible.

01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:15.157
I am not much to look at,|I know I'm an ugly bastard.

01:20:15.355 --> 01:20:17.940
So..., when she came along

01:20:20.233 --> 01:20:22.109
God, she was beautiful.

01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:27.373
I thought some of her would somehow rub of on me.

01:20:29.406 --> 01:20:31.783
At least that is what I think have thought.

01:20:36.035 --> 01:20:39.288
And this is Stephania.

01:20:41.414 --> 01:20:43.374
I was going to introduce you, but...

01:20:43.624 --> 01:20:45.792
Resistance keeps us busy.

01:20:48.502 --> 01:20:50.003
Isn't she beautiful?

01:20:57.633 --> 01:21:01.094
It was the way she  took my hand and removed it from her neck

01:21:02.512 --> 01:21:04.972
her eyes penetrating him...

01:21:05.139 --> 01:21:08.391
We'll think about it, Amadeu, and get back to you.

01:21:16.688 --> 01:21:19.023
Perhaps we can use your clinic as a drop off.

01:21:25.444 --> 01:21:27.570
Why did you take my hand of your neck?

01:21:28.946 --> 01:21:30.416
Did I?

01:21:38.953 --> 01:21:41.080
Have you ever been in love

01:21:42.039 --> 01:21:45.249
so that not even food matters, not even words?

01:21:46.959 --> 01:21:50.461
I am not sure.|You would be sure. You would know.

01:21:52.713 --> 01:21:54.266
You always know.

01:21:55.881 --> 01:21:58.466
You're thinking of him?|What?

01:22:14.477 --> 01:22:16.354
You wish I was Amadeu.

01:22:22.233 --> 01:22:24.192
Does he mention me in the book?

01:22:26.611 --> 01:22:27.861
A lot.

01:22:28.737 --> 01:22:32.364
Then I am surprised she published it, Adriana hated me,

01:22:32.531 --> 01:22:36.325
wanted him all for herself, did not even want to share him with her father.

01:22:36.868 --> 01:22:38.619
You know what happened to him?

01:22:40.245 --> 01:22:41.965
A few months before the Revolution

01:22:42.121 --> 01:22:46.040
he went to Amadeu and asked for stronger painkillers for his back.

01:22:47.166 --> 01:22:50.179
Adriana came every week to the  pharmacy for the pills,

01:22:50.335 --> 01:22:52.962
but he  never took them; he ordered them.

01:22:54.088 --> 01:22:57.840
A week after Amadeu died he swallowed over one hundred.

01:22:58.966 --> 01:23:02.718
The newspapers said he died after a long illness...

01:23:03.761 --> 01:23:06.388
Catholics don't appreciate suicide.

01:23:11.099 --> 01:23:12.225
Everyone out!

01:23:20.147 --> 01:23:21.565
Stephania, come with me.

01:24:28.944 --> 01:24:32.196
If I had had the gun then|I might have shot her.

01:24:40.535 --> 01:24:42.005
And when you got the gun?

01:24:43.537 --> 01:24:45.997
I went straight to Amadeu's clinic.

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.916
I knew they would be there.

01:24:54.419 --> 01:24:56.504
Where are they?|They have gone.

01:24:57.171 --> 01:24:59.423
Don't lie to me...|They have gone, Jorge.

01:25:42.619 --> 01:25:44.005
Give me the gun.

01:26:38.782 --> 01:26:42.785
Stephania is she... is she still alive?

01:26:46.204 --> 01:26:49.873
I bumped into her, two years ago, she was here.

01:26:50.206 --> 01:26:54.167
Attending some seminar or other.

01:26:56.586 --> 01:26:58.712
I asked her how she was.

01:27:01.381 --> 01:27:03.590
She told me she was teaching history...

01:27:04.216 --> 01:27:05.342
Where?

01:27:05.633 --> 01:27:08.594
At the University of Salamanca, Spain.

01:27:11.763 --> 01:27:13.764
And your pharmacy...

01:27:15.724 --> 01:27:19.268
Why do you leave the lights on at night?

01:27:24.438 --> 01:27:26.648
To remind me of Amadeu.

01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:24.270
Mr. da Silva, can I have my bill, please?

01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:28.189
Are you going back to Switzerland?|Yes, via Spain.

01:28:29.065 --> 01:28:31.911
They say right now in Switzerland is terrible,

01:28:32.067 --> 01:28:34.611
with rain, snow, wind...

01:28:34.777 --> 01:28:36.695
I have to go; could I have my bill?

01:28:37.196 --> 01:28:38.446
Excuse me...

01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:44.826
Hello!

01:28:47.703 --> 01:28:50.997
I want to thank you|for what happened on the bridge.

01:28:52.998 --> 01:28:56.250
I've been reading your book...|I don't want it.

01:28:58.752 --> 01:29:01.337
I just want to thank you for what you did.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.508
I got your coat.

01:29:12.011 --> 01:29:13.647
You left it behind.

01:29:19.766 --> 01:29:21.059
Tell me your name?

01:29:26.146 --> 01:29:27.813
Catarina Mendez.

01:29:30.190 --> 01:29:31.399
Yes ..

01:29:32.942 --> 01:29:34.578
That Mendez.

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:40.363
I am the granddaughter of the Butcher of Lisbon.

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:46.701
I didn't know who he was  until I read the book.

01:29:49.036 --> 01:29:51.454
But you can't blame yourself for what your  grandfather did...

01:29:51.621 --> 01:29:52.872
You don't understand.

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.876
I loved him.

01:30:00.544 --> 01:30:02.712
I cried at his funeral.

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:07.007
and I did not understand why so many other people were not crying.

01:30:12.427 --> 01:30:13.980
Anyway...

01:30:15.554 --> 01:30:19.859
It will take some time, but I learn to live with this.

01:30:32.607 --> 01:30:35.109
This would be the same road they took.

01:30:35.734 --> 01:30:39.070
But at night, and in great danger.

01:30:39.987 --> 01:30:41.374
And in love.

01:30:46.242 --> 01:30:48.785
I was moved to see my uncle cry like that.

01:30:49.244 --> 01:30:52.788
I don't know what pleased him more:|the news Stephania  was alive

01:30:52.954 --> 01:30:55.331
or the cards of cigarettes|we gave him.

01:31:00.751 --> 01:31:03.597
So, you return to your school and continue teaching?

01:31:05.963 --> 01:31:07.381
If they'll have me...

01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:12.343
But I'm sure I come back and visit.

01:31:35.108 --> 01:31:36.745
Are you sure she'll be in?

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:41.123
She said she'll be here... Do you come in?

01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:43.416
No, I wait in the car.

01:31:49.284 --> 01:31:51.869
Go, Raimund, I'll be fine here,|take your time.

01:31:55.956 --> 01:31:57.373
Welcome, Raimund

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.846
I'm Stephania.|Thank you so much for meeting me.

01:32:04.878 --> 01:32:06.296
You have the book?

01:32:07.505 --> 01:32:08.839
I do.

01:32:16.261 --> 01:32:18.513
He looks just as I remember him.

01:32:19.346 --> 01:32:22.109
So long ago and still so...

01:32:23.266 --> 01:32:25.893
Would you like some tea?|Thank you.

01:32:26.977 --> 01:32:28.446
What about your friend?

01:32:28.603 --> 01:32:31.282
She's happy in the car.

01:32:31.772 --> 01:32:37.734
I joined the resistance after my father was arrested in 1971, for sabotage.

01:32:39.610 --> 01:32:43.665
They sent him to Tarrafal...|You have heard of it?

01:32:47.115 --> 01:32:50.993
It was also known as 'Campo da Morte Lenta': Camp of the Slow Death.

01:32:55.579 --> 01:32:58.123
It took them two years to kill him.

01:32:59.499 --> 01:33:01.500
And that is how I met Jorge.

01:33:02.668 --> 01:33:06.754
I needed someone strong, some one to protect me...

01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:10.465
I thought that I was in love.

01:33:13.675 --> 01:33:15.228
But then I met Amadeu...

01:33:24.474 --> 01:33:26.934
A new light fell on everything.

01:33:28.477 --> 01:33:31.937
My whole life...

01:33:34.106 --> 01:33:36.107
I could not sleep anymore.

01:33:37.858 --> 01:33:40.568
I went to the clinic as often as I could,

01:33:41.903 --> 01:33:44.321
despite Adriana's thoughts.

01:33:46.781 --> 01:33:50.950
He wanted to take  me in his arms, but he kept rejecting me.

01:33:51.117 --> 01:33:55.422
Jorge, he would say, what about Jorge?|I began to hate Jorge...

01:33:57.205 --> 01:33:59.540
Do you mind if I smoke?|No, please.

01:34:01.541 --> 01:34:03.709
Jealousy is a terrible emotion.

01:34:40.692 --> 01:34:44.528
I could tell from his shoulders, he had seen us.

01:34:45.321 --> 01:34:46.707
Awful...

01:34:50.574 --> 01:34:54.285
But in a way I was relieved; it was done.

01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:58.788
Are you sure your friend is alright?

01:34:58.955 --> 01:35:01.206
Oh yes, she is fine in the car.

01:35:02.791 --> 01:35:04.584
We drove through the night.

01:35:06.585 --> 01:35:09.087
Amadeu kept questioning me.

01:35:09.754 --> 01:35:12.547
Was he searching for me or for life?

01:35:13.465 --> 01:35:16.425
He wanted to know everything, my whole life,

01:35:17.676 --> 01:35:19.552
my memories,

01:35:20.511 --> 01:35:24.305
thoughts, fantasies, dreams...|He was relentless.

01:35:24.847 --> 01:35:28.517
It was almost a relief when 5 kms from the border

01:35:28.683 --> 01:35:31.060
stopped and hid me in the trunk.

01:35:45.570 --> 01:35:46.737
Passport.

01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:11.129
Why are you travelling to Spain?|I'm going to visit relatives.

01:36:13.172 --> 01:36:14.642
Get out of the car, please.

01:36:44.026 --> 01:36:45.110
Keys.

01:36:49.488 --> 01:36:51.823
Do you know Major Rui Luís Mendez,|of the PIDE?

01:36:52.574 --> 01:36:53.825
What about him?

01:36:55.993 --> 01:36:59.089
I want you to call him, have his home number.

01:37:00.746 --> 01:37:03.331
I want you to tell him you're treating me like a criminal.

01:37:20.343 --> 01:37:22.062
He wants to talk to you.

01:37:29.891 --> 01:37:31.934
This is Dr. Amadeu de Prado.

01:37:32.684 --> 01:37:34.686
You are asking too much of me...

01:37:35.228 --> 01:37:38.855
You took my life away from me and I want it back now.

01:37:41.815 --> 01:37:43.900
Give the phone back to my man.

01:37:51.072 --> 01:37:54.168
Ironic, that I should ultimately  be saved

01:37:54.449 --> 01:37:57.295
by the Butcher of Lisbon...

01:38:05.873 --> 01:38:07.124
That night

01:38:09.334 --> 01:38:12.430
we drove to Finisterra and slept in the car.

01:38:52.697 --> 01:38:54.250
We'll go away.

01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:58.284
We take a ship to the Amazon

01:38:58.743 --> 01:39:01.370
to a new world where only you and I exist.

01:39:05.497 --> 01:39:06.832
I write books...

01:39:07.999 --> 01:39:12.221
we invent a new language that only you and I understand.

01:39:16.755 --> 01:39:19.257
We go up the river as far as it will take us.

01:39:22.676 --> 01:39:24.760
Back in time and into the future,

01:39:26.095 --> 01:39:27.929
The very beginning of the end.

01:39:29.347 --> 01:39:31.098
What will I do?

01:39:32.516 --> 01:39:34.559
You'll share it with me.

01:39:37.227 --> 01:39:41.616
The same air, the same feelings, same tastes...

01:39:45.941 --> 01:39:47.661
These things you want...

01:39:48.735 --> 01:39:51.195
You want them for yourself, not for me.

01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:53.613
I want them for both of us.

01:39:54.739 --> 01:39:57.449
He was hungry  for me, for life.

01:39:59.993 --> 01:40:03.537
But the journey he wanted to take was|into his own soul,

01:40:03.704 --> 01:40:04.996
not into mine.

01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.965
I can not do it, Amadeu...

01:40:23.509 --> 01:40:24.926
What do you mean?

01:40:26.177 --> 01:40:29.190
You want more than I can ever give you.

01:40:31.472 --> 01:40:33.109
And I'm not ready.

01:40:39.061 --> 01:40:40.562
I'm so sorry...

01:41:03.244 --> 01:41:04.964
I have friends in Salamanca.

01:41:06.955 --> 01:41:08.873
Will you take me to them?

01:41:14.919 --> 01:41:16.962
He drove me to Salamanca...

01:41:19.964 --> 01:41:21.757
he shook my hand,

01:41:23.258 --> 01:41:26.385
he wished me well and left.

01:41:32.305 --> 01:41:34.640
The next I heard he was dead.

01:41:38.184 --> 01:41:40.603
I always thought I killed him.

01:41:42.979 --> 01:41:46.273
He had an aneurysm.|An aneurysm?

01:41:46.982 --> 01:41:49.776
A blood vessel burst in his brain.

01:41:50.193 --> 01:41:52.277
He's had it for a long time.

01:42:00.616 --> 01:42:03.493
Did you go to his funeral?

01:42:19.421 --> 01:42:22.881
You did not really think I would do it, did you?

01:42:25.633 --> 01:42:27.551
It is no longer important.

01:42:52.151 --> 01:42:53.152
So what happened to

01:42:54.153 --> 01:42:57.905
the names and telephone numbers|you had in your head?

01:42:59.323 --> 01:43:00.490
Lisbon

01:43:01.074 --> 01:43:05.129
3314518,|contact name: Carlos;

01:43:06.202 --> 01:43:11.373
Sintra, 245102,|contact name: Nuno...

01:43:12.415 --> 01:43:15.792
I wrote them all down and passed them on to someone save.

01:43:17.293 --> 01:43:20.879
A few months later they were used to initiate the revolution.

01:43:23.673 --> 01:43:26.602
Your friend must be very tired of waiting...

01:43:32.053 --> 01:43:34.847
You can keep the book if you like.|Thank you.

01:43:35.597 --> 01:43:39.183
I probably more ready for him now then I was back then.

01:43:40.768 --> 01:43:43.394
Goodbye, Raymund.|Goodbye, Stephania.

01:44:03.283 --> 01:44:07.869
'We leave something of ourselves behind|when we leave a place,'

01:44:09.370 --> 01:44:12.998
'We stay there, even though we go away.'

01:44:14.499 --> 01:44:17.918
'And there are things in us that we can find again,'

01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:20.628
'only by going back there.'

01:44:22.129 --> 01:44:25.173
'We travel to ourselves when we go to a place,'

01:44:25.882 --> 01:44:28.175
"Now we have covered the stretch  of our life,

01:44:28.425 --> 01:44:30.927
'no matter how brief it may have been.'

01:44:39.516 --> 01:44:40.683
Is is me.

01:44:44.603 --> 01:44:46.437
Well, we still...

01:44:48.730 --> 01:44:50.284
got five minutes.

01:44:52.233 --> 01:44:53.953
Thank you for...

01:44:56.694 --> 01:44:59.071
telling me I wasn't boring.

01:45:05.033 --> 01:45:07.035
For when I think of their lives,

01:45:08.869 --> 01:45:11.121
Amadeu, Stefania,|the others,

01:45:11.287 --> 01:45:15.749
their lives full of such vitality,

01:45:16.124 --> 01:45:19.376
intensity...|So much so it broke them apart in the end.

01:45:19.543 --> 01:45:20.929
But they lived.

01:45:25.339 --> 01:45:26.923
Where is my life...

01:45:32.093 --> 01:45:34.220
apart from these last days...

01:45:39.682 --> 01:45:42.308
and now  you're going back to it.

01:45:55.151 --> 01:45:57.194
Why don't you just stay?

01:45:59.070 --> 01:46:00.321
What?

01:46:01.822 --> 01:46:04.240
Why don't you just stay?

01:46:05.305 --> 01:46:11.826
