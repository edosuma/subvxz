WEBVTT

00:00.167 --> 00:01.565
Freeze suckers!

00:02.436 --> 00:04.062
We're being robbed.

00:04.138 --> 00:07.801
Now, if you two will just bear with
me, we will reconstruct the evening...

00:07.875 --> 00:09.536
and find out what happened.

00:11.278 --> 00:12.404
Take him, Higgins!

00:12.480 --> 00:13.538
Take him where?

00:13.614 --> 00:16.174
What happened to your clothes?

00:16.317 --> 00:17.875
The safe. Where is it?

00:17.952 --> 00:19.078
We won't tell you.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.381
It's in the office.

00:20.454 --> 00:25.187
Sometimes we remember what we
want to, not what really happened.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.783
Dispatch the Pig!

01:34.096 --> 01:35.859
<i>Hawaiian
sunsets are among the most...</i>

01:35.931 --> 01:37.899
<i>breathtakingly beautiful
in the world.</i>

01:37.967 --> 01:40.959
<i>Grandly vibrant, uniquely
different every day.</i>

01:41.237 --> 01:43.330
<i>They paint a palate
with boundaries that stop...</i>

01:43.406 --> 01:46.136
<i>only at the horizons
of one's imagination.</i>

01:46.208 --> 01:49.575
<i>However, when the sun goes down, it
looks the same all over the world.</i>

01:49.645 --> 01:52.375
<i>Whether you're in Milwaukee
or Maui, it's dark.</i>

01:52.815 --> 01:56.182
<i>But Hawaii's many attributes don't
stop when the sun goes down.</i>

01:56.252 --> 01:58.447
<i>There is still plenty
to see and do.</i>

01:59.588 --> 02:03.422
<i>You could go to a luau, or a
disco, or a fine restaurant...</i>

02:03.492 --> 02:05.460
<i>a harbor cruise
or the Don Ho Show.</i>

02:06.629 --> 02:10.690
<i>You could dance and eat until your feet
and stomach were begging for mercy.</i>

02:10.933 --> 02:14.664
<i>So why catch forty winks at home and
set the alarm clock for 2:00 a. m...</i>

02:14.904 --> 02:16.701
<i>closing time all over town?</i>

02:17.406 --> 02:19.397
<i>Because sometimes in Hawaii...</i>

02:19.675 --> 02:22.109
<i>sports events are aired
very late at night...</i>

02:22.178 --> 02:26.137
<i>and tonight was the pivotal game in
the American League East pennant race.</i>

02:26.215 --> 02:27.739
<i>Orioles against the Tigers.</i>

02:27.817 --> 02:30.945
<i>Probably the biggest game of the year
and I was going to get to see it...</i>

02:31.020 --> 02:33.113
<i>alone, without interruptions...</i>

02:33.189 --> 02:36.852
<i>courtesy of the sports channel and the
new cable system Robin had installed.</i>

02:36.926 --> 02:39.793
<i>So what if I'd had to avoid
friends and radios all day...</i>

02:39.862 --> 02:41.659
<i>so I wouldn't accidentally
hear the score.</i>

02:41.730 --> 02:43.755
<i>So what if it was the middle
of the night.</i>

02:43.833 --> 02:47.496
<i>To me it was a perfect evening
in Paradise.</i>

02:47.570 --> 02:50.368
<i>Exciting
baseball. What do you say, Joe?</i>

02:50.439 --> 02:53.772
<i>Harry, I say
the sun is up, the stands are packed...</i>

02:54.043 --> 02:56.978
<i>Tigers are ready, and it
promises to be a great game.</i>

02:57.480 --> 02:59.380
<i>We interrupt tonight's game...</i>

02:59.448 --> 03:01.313
<i>between the Baltimore Orioles
and the Detroit Tigers...</i>

03:01.383 --> 03:02.975
<i>for this late-breaking
news flash.</i>

03:03.052 --> 03:06.180
<i>Right now we have a live report
from reporter Ami Tenenbaum...</i>

03:06.255 --> 03:08.450
<i>at the scene
of this shocking story.</i>

03:08.624 --> 03:11.184
<i>I'm here at the posh
and exclusive Kamehameha Club...</i>

03:11.260 --> 03:13.785
<i>where a daring armed robbery
has just occurred.</i>

03:13.863 --> 03:16.263
<i>Apparently, three masked,
heavily armed gunmen...</i>

03:16.332 --> 03:19.631
<i>broke into the club at closing and
robbed the manager of cash receipts...</i>

03:19.702 --> 03:21.260
<i>totaling thousands of dollars.</i>

03:21.337 --> 03:24.500
<i>We are expecting to hear from one of
the Board of Directors at any moment...</i>

03:24.573 --> 03:25.631
<i>but in the meantime...</i>

03:25.708 --> 03:28.939
<i>perhaps we can find out what the
police have to say on this matter.</i>

03:29.011 --> 03:31.639
<i>Lieutenant Tanaka, excuse me.</i>

03:32.982 --> 03:34.074
<i>Yes.</i>

03:34.149 --> 03:36.117
<i>Do you have any firm
leads or clues...</i>

03:36.185 --> 03:38.380
<i>as to who the perpetrators
of this crime are?</i>

03:38.454 --> 03:41.890
<i>Unfortunately, the accounts of the
witnesses are widely divergent.</i>

03:41.957 --> 03:44.084
<i>It's going to take an
exhaustive investigation...</i>

03:44.159 --> 03:45.922
<i>before I can make any sense
out of this.</i>

03:45.995 --> 03:47.826
<i>That means no then?
Right.</i>

03:48.030 --> 03:50.123
<i>The only thing
I am sure of is...</i>

03:50.232 --> 03:53.599
<i>the robbers may have had some
help from somebody on the inside.</i>

03:53.669 --> 03:55.830
<i>Thank you very much,
Lieutenant Tanaka.</i>

03:55.905 --> 03:58.237
<i>I have been assured-
By the way...</i>

03:58.407 --> 04:00.967
<i>do you have the score
on the Tigers-Oriole game?</i>

04:01.043 --> 04:02.442
<i>Not yet.</i>

04:02.511 --> 04:04.570
<i>Thank you very much,
Lieutenant Tanaka.</i>

04:04.647 --> 04:06.706
<i>I've been assured that we'll
be getting a statement...</i>

04:06.782 --> 04:08.943
<i>from one of the
Board of Directors.</i>

04:09.385 --> 04:12.286
<i>Here he is right now. Jonathan
Higgins, who was apparently...</i>

04:12.354 --> 04:14.117
<i>present at the time
of the robbery.</i>

04:14.189 --> 04:16.749
<i>Mr. Higgins, can you give us
your comments as to...</i>

04:16.825 --> 04:18.486
<i>what happened here at the club?</i>

04:18.560 --> 04:19.584
<i>Comments?</i>

04:20.262 --> 04:23.425
<i>Well, I felt the robbery was in
incredibly poor taste in as much as the...</i>

04:23.499 --> 04:25.660
<i>blackguards had
the audacity to...</i>

04:27.603 --> 04:28.900
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

04:30.205 --> 04:32.901
<i>I'm afraid you'll have to wait
until tomorrow morning...</i>

04:32.975 --> 04:35.500
<i>when the Board will issue
an official statement.</i>

04:36.512 --> 04:37.638
<i>Good night.</i>

04:39.882 --> 04:42.077
Lieutenant, these guys were big.

04:42.151 --> 04:44.676
I'm talking 6 feet,
200 pounds easy.

04:44.753 --> 04:47.745
The lout in the gorilla mask
was six feet four, at least.

04:47.823 --> 04:49.723
Oh, no, no, no. He wasn't
that tall. Lieutenant.

04:49.792 --> 04:51.760
Why are you asking the same
dumb questions?

04:51.827 --> 04:53.818
Shouldn't you be checking
fingerprints or something?

04:53.896 --> 04:55.295
They were wearing gloves.

04:55.364 --> 04:57.025
No, they weren't.
Yes, they were.

04:57.099 --> 04:58.862
Can't you guys agree
on anything?

04:58.934 --> 05:00.094
I doubt it.

05:00.169 --> 05:02.296
Thomas, you'll never believe
what happened.

05:02.371 --> 05:05.169
I saw it on the news.
How you doing, Rusty? Keoki?

05:05.574 --> 05:07.007
What happened to your clothes?

05:07.076 --> 05:08.509
I'm ruined.

05:08.644 --> 05:09.804
You.

05:10.479 --> 05:12.413
You talk to them.

05:12.481 --> 05:14.346
And if three of you come up
with anything...

05:14.416 --> 05:17.317
that even slightly resembles
a lead, let me know.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.820
I've got a ballgame to watch.

05:21.056 --> 05:22.114
You guys all right?
Yeah.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.180
No.

05:23.258 --> 05:25.522
I'm quite certain
that the Directors of this club...

05:25.594 --> 05:29.189
are holding a secret ballot this
moment to remove me from the Board.

05:29.264 --> 05:32.358
Of course, since I've already
resigned, that's quite unnecessary.

05:32.434 --> 05:34.197
You don't have to resign,
Higgins.

05:34.269 --> 05:36.669
You're on about
a hundred other boards.

05:36.805 --> 05:38.773
What about me?
I've only got one job.

05:38.841 --> 05:40.741
Perhaps you should have
thought of that...

05:40.809 --> 05:43.107
before you hired that
incompetent waitress, Rosette.

05:43.178 --> 05:45.146
It's Rosine.
- I'm certain that she's the one...

05:45.214 --> 05:46.613
who arranged
those hooligans-

05:46.682 --> 05:48.309
Hey, why are
you picking on Rosine?

05:48.384 --> 05:50.011
I mean,
if there was an inside man...

05:50.085 --> 05:52.610
it was probably that wormy guy
you hired to do the deposits.

05:52.688 --> 05:54.679
I can't wait for this.
Wormy! George Wong, wormy?

05:54.757 --> 05:56.281
He's the finest CPA
on the Island.

05:56.358 --> 05:59.122
Perhaps if you hadn't been ogling
the lady at your table all night-

05:59.194 --> 06:00.354
Ogling? Ogling?

06:00.429 --> 06:03.023
Guys, guys, guys! Time out.

06:03.799 --> 06:06.927
We're never going to get anywhere if
you don't stop bickering like this.

06:07.002 --> 06:09.232
We're not going to get
anywhere anyway.

06:09.304 --> 06:11.602
Obviously someone
working from inside...

06:11.674 --> 06:13.835
planned and executed
a masterful robbery.

06:13.909 --> 06:15.740
So masterful,
as a matter of fact...

06:15.811 --> 06:17.506
Lieutenant Tanaka
has as much as admitted...

06:17.579 --> 06:19.274
that it's unsolvable
and gone home.

06:19.348 --> 06:20.645
I suggest that we do the same.

06:20.716 --> 06:22.115
Wait a minute.

06:22.184 --> 06:24.345
How do you know
there was an inside man?

06:24.420 --> 06:28.322
Somebody must have tipped them off that
the cash was overflowing in the safe.

06:28.390 --> 06:29.687
Thanks to you.

06:30.192 --> 06:31.682
Don't start, T.C.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.057
Well, who else knew about that?

06:33.128 --> 06:35.426
Oh, no. No, you don't.

06:36.065 --> 06:38.533
Very clever, Magnum,
but it is not going to work.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.727
We're not going to allow you
to drag us into...

06:40.803 --> 06:42.896
one of your parlor room
detective dramas.

06:43.272 --> 06:46.264
I'm much too tired and upset to
go through some useless charades.

06:46.341 --> 06:49.401
I would not consider
recovering the money useless.

06:49.511 --> 06:51.342
You think you might be
able to do that?

06:51.413 --> 06:52.778
No, he couldn't.

06:52.848 --> 06:55.112
Yes, I could. With your help.
Look, one of you...

06:55.184 --> 06:59.280
saw or heard something that's going
to be the key to this thing. Trust me.

06:59.354 --> 07:00.616
Magnum.

07:01.156 --> 07:03.420
I don't know.
It all happened pretty fast.

07:03.492 --> 07:05.585
What happened
to your eye, Keoki?

07:06.161 --> 07:07.651
It's not worth talking about.

07:07.730 --> 07:09.698
Sure it is. You guys
tell me what happened...

07:09.765 --> 07:12.233
then we can figure out
who the inside man is.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.791
What've we got to lose?

07:13.869 --> 07:17.270
Sleep.
It's late and I am going home.

07:17.339 --> 07:19.204
My sentiments exactly.
Oh, fine.

07:19.274 --> 07:20.400
Go ahead and split.

07:20.476 --> 07:23.343
Personally, I'm going to stay
and try and save my job.

07:23.479 --> 07:24.468
Great.

07:26.648 --> 07:27.740
Perhaps...

07:28.617 --> 07:30.312
we ought to stay here...

07:30.986 --> 07:33.045
to make sure
he doesn't slip up...

07:33.188 --> 07:34.553
on any of the details.

07:34.623 --> 07:36.818
He'd better not slip up.

07:36.925 --> 07:39.951
Keoki, put on a pot of coffee.
This could take some time.

07:40.028 --> 07:41.017
Sure, Magnum.

07:41.096 --> 07:42.324
Okay, Rick...

07:42.898 --> 07:44.297
let's get started.

07:45.784 --> 07:46.910
Well...

07:47.619 --> 07:49.086
it was closing time...

07:49.154 --> 07:52.089
and Joy was just finishing up
her last set on the piano.

07:52.157 --> 07:55.183
<i>Opening week of the new Anuenue
Terrace room was a big success...</i>

07:55.260 --> 07:57.319
<i>so, I wanted to make sure that
I was sticking around...</i>

07:57.395 --> 07:59.727
** <i>to make sure</i>
<i>nothing went wrong.</i>

07:59.798 --> 08:02.096
<i>Higgins and I were
sitting at the bar.</i>

08:04.202 --> 08:06.568
<i>T.C. was making goo-goo eyes
at some chick.</i>

08:07.806 --> 08:10.036
<i>And Rusty was sitting
at his usual place.</i>

08:10.108 --> 08:12.542
Come on, Rusty.
Closing time. Wake up.

08:17.682 --> 08:20.276
Looks like you take
Rusty home tonight.

08:20.352 --> 08:21.546
Again.

08:21.820 --> 08:24.015
Hey, could you take two
mai tais to table four?

08:24.089 --> 08:26.489
I've got something
important to do. Sure.

08:26.558 --> 08:27.820
Thanks.

08:30.328 --> 08:33.388
Another fruit punch for me
and a white wine for the lady.

08:33.465 --> 08:34.898
Last call, T.C.

08:35.767 --> 08:37.359
Last call here, maybe.

08:38.203 --> 08:41.263
But what can I tell you, I
think the little lady has plans.

08:41.339 --> 08:44.706
A nightcap at her place
and then, who knows?

08:44.809 --> 08:46.936
She's actually asked you
to her place?

08:47.012 --> 08:50.175
Well, not in so many words.
But she will.

08:50.582 --> 08:52.243
Believe me, she will.

08:52.317 --> 08:54.785
Hey, barkeep,
how about those drinks?

08:54.853 --> 08:57.549
You believe this guy? Barking
out orders while Joy's singing.

08:57.622 --> 09:00.489
Perhaps he doesn't realize
she is singing.

09:00.559 --> 09:02.083
Oh, very funny, Higgins.

09:02.160 --> 09:05.459
Joy Kelly happens to be one of
Honolulu's most popular entertainers.

09:05.530 --> 09:07.395
Plus, she's got great talent.

09:07.465 --> 09:08.989
Indeed.

09:09.301 --> 09:12.668
If her talent were half as
impressive as her physique...

09:12.971 --> 09:16.202
perhaps there would be a
reason to extend her engagement.

09:16.441 --> 09:17.635
As it is-

09:24.015 --> 09:25.607
As it is...

09:26.151 --> 09:28.619
the
Board has decided to let her go.

09:28.787 --> 09:32.723
As manager of the Club, it is
your responsibility to tell her.

09:33.124 --> 09:36.321
Oh, no, you don't, Higgins. If
you want her fired, you do it.

09:36.394 --> 09:38.862
Rick, that was Mrs. Halloway.

09:39.464 --> 09:41.659
She's about a quarter mile down
the street in a phone booth.

09:41.733 --> 09:43.394
She got a flat tire
on her way home.

09:43.468 --> 09:44.662
Oh, great.

09:44.736 --> 09:47.170
She's about 90 years old.
How's she gonna fix it?

09:47.239 --> 09:48.729
She's one of our
charter members.

09:48.807 --> 09:50.866
We must do something
to help her.

09:51.009 --> 09:52.271
I'll send Max.

09:53.211 --> 09:54.678
Good idea.
Hey, Max...

09:54.746 --> 09:56.611
Keoki, let me have
T.C.'s check.

09:56.681 --> 09:59.548
Well, I'll go see how George
is doing with the deposits...

09:59.618 --> 10:02.348
while you have your
conversation with Miss Kelly.

10:02.420 --> 10:05.821
Forget it. I'll check in
on George, you talk to Joy.

10:06.691 --> 10:08.852
It's the Board's decision,
Higgins.

10:11.229 --> 10:12.355
Very well.

10:13.865 --> 10:15.799
Why don't we just take my car?

10:16.034 --> 10:17.797
I've got a better idea.

10:18.103 --> 10:20.697
Why don't I take my car
and you take your car?

10:21.206 --> 10:22.605
But I don't know where you live.

10:22.674 --> 10:23.732
I know.

10:26.911 --> 10:28.503
It's on the house, T.C.

10:29.648 --> 10:30.706
Thanks.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.587
I don't understand.

10:37.188 --> 10:39.748
What is it that you
don't like about my act?

10:39.824 --> 10:42.793
Is it the material?
My piano playing?

10:43.862 --> 10:45.022
My voice?

10:45.096 --> 10:46.688
That about covers it.

10:47.299 --> 10:49.597
Except, of course,
for the costume.

10:51.169 --> 10:52.761
What's wrong with my costume?

10:52.837 --> 10:54.304
You're in it.

10:54.973 --> 10:56.099
Almost.

10:57.142 --> 11:00.134
There's only one place
you may be fit to play.

11:00.378 --> 11:01.402
Where?

11:01.479 --> 11:02.673
Cleveland.

11:03.682 --> 11:06.617
Cleveland?
Oh, Mr. Higgins...

11:07.018 --> 11:10.078
I would rather leave show
business than play Cleveland.

11:10.155 --> 11:12.521
I'd say you're
making the right choice.

11:13.992 --> 11:15.550
George, how's it going?

11:15.627 --> 11:18.187
Oh, Mr. Wright.

11:18.897 --> 11:20.262
Almost finished.

11:22.967 --> 11:24.332
What time is it?

11:24.703 --> 11:25.965
Five to 2:00.

11:26.071 --> 11:27.163
So late?

11:27.605 --> 11:29.038
What could've happened to...

11:29.107 --> 11:30.096
To what?

11:31.109 --> 11:32.269
Nothing.

11:34.179 --> 11:35.874
Just a few more minutes.

11:37.449 --> 11:40.748
You know, in a way I'm kinda
glad that that rich Arab guy left.

11:41.152 --> 11:44.417
Leaving all this money around
kinda made me nervous.

11:47.058 --> 11:48.116
What was that?

11:48.193 --> 11:49.717
How would I know?

11:54.632 --> 11:56.327
All right, get
him up off the floor.

11:56.401 --> 11:58.631
Get him up. Get him up.
Come on, move it.

11:58.703 --> 12:00.398
Get up.
Get up and get over there.

12:00.472 --> 12:01.996
What's going on here?

12:05.477 --> 12:06.637
Rick...

12:07.579 --> 12:09.240
we're being robbed.

12:12.684 --> 12:15.619
What complete
and utter poppycock!

12:15.720 --> 12:17.915
Man, you've got
everything wrong.

12:18.923 --> 12:20.322
What really happened was-

12:20.392 --> 12:22.860
Hey, I thought you were in
a rush to get out of here.

12:22.927 --> 12:24.360
How can we possibly go home...

12:24.429 --> 12:26.294
if you're going to
distort everything?

12:26.364 --> 12:28.832
Surely you don't believe
a word of this?

12:29.534 --> 12:32.435
Well, I don't
know. Some of it sounds right.

12:32.504 --> 12:34.563
It just seems like
you're leaving parts out.

12:34.639 --> 12:36.937
Like what happened
to your clothes?

12:40.979 --> 12:43.948
So anyway, we were all huddled
together over there...

12:44.816 --> 12:46.613
and Higgins was
brushing himself off.

12:47.118 --> 12:49.712
Rick, we're being robbed.

12:49.954 --> 12:52.582
All right. Over here
with the rest of them.

12:52.657 --> 12:53.817
Oh, yeah?

12:54.359 --> 12:56.623
Come on, move it.
Tough guy, huh?

12:56.694 --> 13:00.061
Well, let me tell you something,
pal. I ain't scared of you.

13:00.999 --> 13:02.364
What did he say?

13:02.434 --> 13:05.028
I'm going to give you one last
chance to put your guns down...

13:05.103 --> 13:07.037
before this turns
into a serious crime.

13:07.105 --> 13:08.834
Is he talking to us?
Please, sir.

13:08.907 --> 13:12.138
Pay no attention to him.
The man is insane.

13:12.210 --> 13:14.075
Come on, Higgins.
Get tough!

13:14.145 --> 13:16.306
Orville, we've got to do
what they say.

13:16.381 --> 13:18.281
Or what? What's the matter
with you guys?

13:18.349 --> 13:20.214
I thought I told you to move.

13:20.285 --> 13:22.276
Let me tell you something,
Pig...

13:22.454 --> 13:25.116
nobody tells me what to do.
You got that?

13:33.865 --> 13:37.198
George, Rosey,
let's stand over there.

13:45.810 --> 13:47.004
Everybody freeze!

13:48.813 --> 13:50.110
Oh, my.

13:55.954 --> 13:59.685
Please, I beseech you. We'll
do exactly as you request.

13:59.757 --> 14:02.817
Only let's not have any more
of this senseless violence.

14:02.894 --> 14:04.794
The safe. Where is it?

14:04.863 --> 14:05.887
We won't tell you.

14:05.964 --> 14:07.261
It's in the office.

14:07.332 --> 14:09.357
Why don't you tell them
the combination, too?

14:09.434 --> 14:11.561
I forgot to lock it.
George!

14:11.636 --> 14:15.333
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. And all
that money is just lying around.

14:16.875 --> 14:18.240
You two stay here...

14:18.309 --> 14:20.937
I'll take one of them with
me to get the bread. Right.

14:21.012 --> 14:23.606
Surely there is no necessity
for one of us to accompany you.

14:23.681 --> 14:26.206
After all, the safe is open,
the money out.

14:26.317 --> 14:29.753
What possible advantage could
there be to taking along a witness?

14:29.888 --> 14:31.446
I'll take the runt.

14:31.589 --> 14:34.820
No. Forget Higgins. If you
take anybody, you take me.

14:34.893 --> 14:36.053
Orville.

14:36.127 --> 14:38.891
I'll kayo the Pig in the office.
You take care of the other two guys.

14:38.963 --> 14:40.225
Are you crazy?

14:40.298 --> 14:42.027
Rick, be careful.

14:42.600 --> 14:43.999
Don't worry, baby.

14:50.842 --> 14:52.104
Okay, Porker.

14:53.177 --> 14:54.235
Let's go.

14:59.817 --> 15:02.183
You're making
a big mistake here, pal.

15:03.621 --> 15:05.282
Here, take this.

15:05.356 --> 15:08.519
I mean, you're not just
dealing with me. I'm connected.

15:08.726 --> 15:09.988
Fill it.

15:10.061 --> 15:11.619
Okay, okay.

15:11.696 --> 15:13.061
I'm just telling you...

15:13.131 --> 15:15.565
let's say you get out of here
tonight with the dough...

15:15.633 --> 15:18.295
you think Ice Pick is just
gonna let you walk away?

15:18.369 --> 15:22.271
You can run, but you can't hide.
This is a small island, pal.

15:23.141 --> 15:24.267
Think about it.

15:24.342 --> 15:26.936
Ice Pick? You know Ice Pick?

15:27.979 --> 15:29.674
He's a close personal friend.

15:29.747 --> 15:32.307
Now, if you give me that gun
right now, maybe, just maybe...

15:32.383 --> 15:35.477
I could talk Ice Pick out of not
making you sushi for the sharks.

15:35.553 --> 15:37.043
What do you say, pal?

15:38.056 --> 15:40.047
I don't know. Golly.

15:41.059 --> 15:42.287
I didn't count on this.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.987
Well, don't say
I didn't warn you.

15:49.367 --> 15:50.800
All right, hold it!

15:50.868 --> 15:51.892
Take him, Higgins!

15:51.970 --> 15:53.062
Take him where?

15:53.137 --> 15:54.263
Over there.

15:55.106 --> 15:57.040
Get over there over the couch.

15:58.242 --> 16:00.472
Bread in the safe. Get it.

16:00.545 --> 16:02.172
I say, old man,
are you all right?

16:02.246 --> 16:05.238
It's nothing, Higgins. Just
a broken nose. It'll heal.

16:05.316 --> 16:07.511
I'm afraid
I've rather let you down.

16:07.652 --> 16:10.280
Forget it, Higgins.
We can't all be heroes.

16:10.355 --> 16:11.913
No, no.

16:12.657 --> 16:14.784
I'm devastated
by my own behavior.

16:15.793 --> 16:19.456
I should have stood by you,
fighting shoulder to shoulder.

16:19.931 --> 16:23.458
Instead of advocating shameful
appeasement to these ruffians.

16:24.168 --> 16:27.467
I can only hope
when this nightmare is over...

16:28.773 --> 16:31.401
that I can find some way
to make it up to you.

16:32.677 --> 16:34.042
All of you.

16:34.112 --> 16:37.138
Don't take it so hard.
You broke under pressure.

16:38.116 --> 16:39.981
It could happen to anybody.

16:40.652 --> 16:43.587
No, please! Not me!
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

16:45.289 --> 16:48.554
Look, please, please,
leave me here.

16:49.327 --> 16:51.989
I figure this is the
guy we gonna take as a hostage.

16:52.063 --> 16:55.999
Oh, no, no, no. Maybe you ought
to take the girls? Or Rusty.

16:57.135 --> 16:58.159
Take Higgins.

16:58.236 --> 16:59.225
Me?

16:59.671 --> 17:01.639
I've never been a hostage
in my life.

17:01.873 --> 17:03.738
I wouldn't know how to be one.

17:04.242 --> 17:07.211
Surely there's someone here
with a little experience.

17:10.848 --> 17:13.373
If you have to take someone,
take me.

17:13.751 --> 17:17.117
<i>That's it! I am not
going to listen to another word.</i>

17:17.188 --> 17:19.213
Not one more word.

17:19.290 --> 17:22.156
Wait, T.C. He didn't get to explain
what happened to your clothes.

17:22.226 --> 17:25.627
Yeah, well, he may not live long
enough to explain that to you.

17:25.696 --> 17:27.994
Hey, I'm just saying it
the way I remember.

17:28.066 --> 17:32.400
I wouldn't call that memory. I would call
that the insane, crazed meanderings...

17:32.470 --> 17:34.665
of an obviously demented mind.

17:34.739 --> 17:36.570
You saying I'm wrong?
Yes.

17:36.641 --> 17:39.701
Okay, fine. Fine. I suppose you
guys got a different version.

17:39.777 --> 17:42.678
You got it, baby. Now,
here's what really went down.

17:43.448 --> 17:46.884
It was closing time and Joy was just
finishing her last set at the piano.

17:48.352 --> 17:51.185
<i>I was having this
fascinating conversation...</i>

17:51.255 --> 17:54.452
<i>with this lovely young lady that
I'd met at a poetry meeting.</i>

17:55.526 --> 17:58.154
My first Ph. D. Was
in the field of Economics.

17:59.330 --> 18:03.357
My dissertation traced the writings
on man's physical wants and needs from-

18:03.434 --> 18:05.868
Physical needs and wants.

18:07.071 --> 18:09.835
From the earliest
Oriental moral codes...

18:10.341 --> 18:11.831
Moral codes.

18:12.643 --> 18:15.339
Up through the medieval
feudal period culminating...

18:15.413 --> 18:18.280
with the emergence of
Karl Marx and the socialists.

18:21.119 --> 18:24.987
Ntozake, I don't think I've ever met a
woman with a Ph. D. In Economics before.

18:26.858 --> 18:30.658
I don't usually tell anybody.
It scares them away.

18:31.696 --> 18:32.822
Not me.

18:33.631 --> 18:37.692
I think Economics
is so interesting.

18:39.303 --> 18:40.463
You do?

18:43.508 --> 18:44.873
Care for another?

18:44.942 --> 18:46.637
Mmm-hmm. Thank you.

18:59.123 --> 19:02.286
Another fruit punch for me
and a white wine for the lady.

19:02.593 --> 19:04.117
It's the last call, T.C.

19:04.195 --> 19:05.787
Last call here, maybe.

19:05.863 --> 19:08.764
But this is one lady I
don't intend to let get away.

19:09.133 --> 19:11.124
Going to her place
for a nightcap?

19:18.676 --> 19:21.110
Hey, barkeep,
how about those drinks?

19:22.480 --> 19:24.209
Won't be long now, little lady.

19:24.282 --> 19:26.807
Spence, people might hear you.

19:31.889 --> 19:32.981
Oh, thank you.

19:34.826 --> 19:36.987
You know, I don't know
when I've had so much fun.

19:37.061 --> 19:38.187
Me, either.

19:38.429 --> 19:42.229
Say, why don't I pick you up tomorrow
and take you for a ride in my helicopter?

19:42.333 --> 19:43.823
Tour of the Islands?

19:44.068 --> 19:45.433
My specialty.

19:46.204 --> 19:48.001
I'd love to, T.C.,
but I can't.

19:48.072 --> 19:50.506
I've got to conduct a workshop
at the University.

19:50.575 --> 19:52.372
But you're welcome to come.

19:58.716 --> 20:00.206
Yeah, I know.

20:00.284 --> 20:03.219
What could be more boring
than a workshop in Economics?

20:03.287 --> 20:06.814
No, no. I'd love to come
hear you speak. What time?

20:07.525 --> 20:08.924
We start at 10:00.

20:10.094 --> 20:11.823
Maybe we can go together.

20:12.363 --> 20:14.490
Why don't I pick you up
in my car?

20:15.266 --> 20:18.463
No, it's probably better if I
take my car and you take your car.

20:18.536 --> 20:20.902
But I have no idea
where you live. Yet.

20:21.672 --> 20:23.833
Hey, here's your check.

20:30.147 --> 20:31.341
Cash, turkey.

20:39.023 --> 20:40.388
Keep the change.

20:42.493 --> 20:44.290
T.C.,
why is he so rude?

20:44.562 --> 20:46.029
He doesn't know any better.

20:46.464 --> 20:49.524
He comes from a culturally
deprived environment.

20:51.302 --> 20:53.031
I try to make allowances.

20:54.972 --> 20:57.167
T.C., I've never met a man
like you.

20:58.209 --> 21:01.406
You're just so enlightened,
so compassionate...

21:01.579 --> 21:03.774
so socially wise.

21:05.583 --> 21:07.881
Or do you think
you could consider...

21:09.253 --> 21:13.155
Maybe you'd like to perhaps come
up to my place for a nightcap?

21:16.360 --> 21:17.691
I'd be honored.

21:19.664 --> 21:20.961
Shall we leave?

21:33.311 --> 21:34.710
Freeze suckers!

21:40.335 --> 21:41.965
That's exactly
the way I told it.

21:41.990 --> 21:42.759
No, it isn't.

21:42.837 --> 21:45.431
Except that - Except that
neither of you is reciting...

21:45.506 --> 21:47.940
anything even remotely
resembling the truth.

21:48.008 --> 21:51.409
But, of course, what can one expect
from simple, primitive minds...

21:51.479 --> 21:52.810
that overload
at the drop of a...

21:52.913 --> 21:55.473
multi-dependent-claused
declarative sentence?

21:56.232 --> 21:57.460
What?

21:57.685 --> 21:59.414
Okay, guys,
here's some more coffee.

21:59.487 --> 22:01.648
Thanks, Keoki.
How's the eye?

22:01.889 --> 22:03.288
It's okay, I guess.

22:03.491 --> 22:05.516
Say, if you don't need me
anymore, I guess I'll just-

22:05.593 --> 22:07.823
Maybe you ought to have
Doc Ibold look at that.

22:07.895 --> 22:11.456
No, no. It's just kinda tender,
that's all. It'll be fine. Really.

22:11.799 --> 22:13.460
So, if you don't need me...

22:13.534 --> 22:16.196
Magnum, I refuse to sit
silently by any longer.

22:16.270 --> 22:18.261
Either I will be heard,
or I'll leave.

22:18.339 --> 22:20.466
You can leave
if you want to, Higgins.

22:20.541 --> 22:24.033
I'm sure T.C. can tell me what
happened to all your clothes.

22:26.547 --> 22:28.242
Keoki, a brandy, please.

22:28.315 --> 22:31.682
Okay, now come on, T.C. I think
we're starting to get somewhere.

22:31.919 --> 22:33.750
Oh, yeah, yeah. Where was I?

22:33.821 --> 22:36.722
You were going to tell me what
happened to all your clothes.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.918
Forget about the clothes. I want
to get to the more important stuff.

22:39.994 --> 22:42.485
I mean, we were facing down
three armed robbers.

22:42.563 --> 22:44.758
So I knew right away
that our only hope...

22:44.832 --> 22:46.993
was for everybody
to play the whole scene cool.

22:48.068 --> 22:50.127
Oh, my God.
Higgins.

22:50.204 --> 22:52.695
What kind of adolescent,
and absurdly premature...

22:52.773 --> 22:54.400
April Fool's joke are you up to?

22:54.475 --> 22:55.874
Higgins-
Really, Magnum.

22:55.943 --> 22:59.003
Over the past three years you have
continuously and deliberately tried...

22:59.079 --> 23:01.673
to distract me by donning
that ridiculous gorilla mask.

23:01.882 --> 23:05.943
An act, I might add, which I have managed
through enormous self-will, to ignore.

23:06.187 --> 23:07.882
But I can ignore it no longer.

23:07.955 --> 23:11.049
There are ladies present who might be
frightened by this bizarre display of-

23:11.125 --> 23:12.285
Shut up!

23:18.566 --> 23:19.999
You're not Magnum.

23:22.536 --> 23:24.629
Higgins, you all right?

23:33.013 --> 23:34.776
What's going on here?

23:35.349 --> 23:36.907
We're being robbed.

23:37.318 --> 23:39.650
All right. Over
here with the rest of them.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.348
Over where?
What's he talking about?

23:42.690 --> 23:44.123
Who are these guys?

23:44.258 --> 23:45.247
Just...

23:46.193 --> 23:47.854
do as they say, Rick.

23:48.362 --> 23:51.297
And nobody, I mean,
nobody will get hurt.

23:52.800 --> 23:56.361
Come on, move it, move it.
Get over there.

23:58.472 --> 23:59.962
Come on, you, too.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.598
Hey, leave him alone.

24:01.675 --> 24:03.006
That's Rusty.

24:03.277 --> 24:06.144
He passes out there every
night. Wouldn't hurt a fly.

24:06.213 --> 24:07.305
Odd.

24:07.915 --> 24:11.351
I'm sure I must have been in
a situation like this before.

24:11.752 --> 24:14.346
But for the life of me,
I can't remember when.

24:14.622 --> 24:15.646
Stop talking.

24:15.723 --> 24:16.747
Perhaps in Burma.

24:16.824 --> 24:17.848
Higgins.

24:17.925 --> 24:18.949
No.
Please.

24:19.026 --> 24:20.425
No Halloween masks.
You'll be all right.

24:20.494 --> 24:22.223
Maybe we ought to
call the police or something.

24:22.296 --> 24:24.890
Don't kill him.
He's just stupid.

24:25.266 --> 24:26.631
Everybody freeze!

24:29.470 --> 24:30.767
Oh, my!

24:38.579 --> 24:41.878
Higgins, maybe you'd better go
and administer first aid.

24:42.049 --> 24:43.073
The Sudan.

24:43.150 --> 24:44.139
Pardon?

24:44.218 --> 24:47.915
Yes. I believe I was in a situation
very nearly like this in...

24:48.789 --> 24:50.882
No, I've never been
in the Sudan.

24:51.025 --> 24:53.255
The safe. Where is it?

24:53.327 --> 24:54.692
Oh, it's in the office,
but it's-

24:54.762 --> 24:55.751
Unlocked.

24:57.197 --> 24:59.825
We forgot to lock it.
Sorry.

25:00.601 --> 25:04.367
That's all right, George.
Anyone can make a mistake.

25:05.539 --> 25:07.473
You two stay
here and watch them.

25:07.541 --> 25:09.304
I'll take one of them with me
to get the bread.

25:09.376 --> 25:10.468
Yeah.
Right.

25:10.544 --> 25:14.036
I do recall reading about
a case like this one time...

25:14.114 --> 25:16.947
but unfortunately,
I didn't witness it.

25:18.652 --> 25:20.677
Come with me, Shorty.

25:20.888 --> 25:22.082
Rick, be careful.

25:27.528 --> 25:28.859
Who are these guys?

25:28.929 --> 25:30.021
Come on.

25:31.699 --> 25:33.064
Where you going?

25:34.568 --> 25:36.399
Are you men truly animals?

25:36.837 --> 25:39.101
I'm going to take care
of his wounds.

25:39.707 --> 25:41.436
And if you're going to
shoot me for it...

25:41.508 --> 25:43.999
then you'll have your
conscience to answer to.

25:47.147 --> 25:48.239
Go ahead.

25:57.524 --> 25:58.684
Are you okay, man?

25:58.759 --> 26:00.090
Hey, what happened?

26:00.494 --> 26:02.962
Don't worry.
You're going to be all right.

26:04.898 --> 26:08.459
I'm sorry.
I thought I had them.

26:09.036 --> 26:11.163
Hey, it's okay.

26:13.841 --> 26:17.368
The important thing is for
everyone to get out of here alive.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.575
So no more heroics.

26:22.583 --> 26:23.743
Okay?

26:26.120 --> 26:27.246
Thanks.

26:28.756 --> 26:30.189
Is he okay?

26:30.257 --> 26:31.622
He's fine, my dear.

26:32.459 --> 26:33.619
Oh, thank God.

26:33.694 --> 26:35.059
Oh, I've got it.

26:35.596 --> 26:38.087
There was a time when we
were on the Caspian Sea...

26:38.165 --> 26:39.894
I think we found us a hostage.

26:39.967 --> 26:41.332
But there were no hostages.

26:41.402 --> 26:42.869
There's no need for hostages.

26:42.936 --> 26:46.838
In that case, this is very reminiscent
of the time we were on the Caspian Sea.

26:46.907 --> 26:48.772
Don't you ever stop talking?

26:49.209 --> 26:50.540
I beg your pardon?

26:50.611 --> 26:51.908
I'm taking him out of here.

26:52.212 --> 26:55.045
I can't stand all this talk,
talk, talk, talk!

26:56.417 --> 26:58.885
Do you think you will be
taking hostages or not?

26:58.952 --> 27:00.317
You got it, pal.

27:01.188 --> 27:03.315
In fact, we'll be taking
the broad.

27:05.926 --> 27:08.394
You're not going anywhere
with anyone.

27:08.529 --> 27:10.827
The boss says we take a hostage.

27:11.031 --> 27:14.330
Some boss. You work for
a man who picks on...

27:15.002 --> 27:16.765
poor, defenseless women?

27:17.404 --> 27:19.235
T.C., they're armed
and dangerous.

27:19.306 --> 27:20.295
Not to worry.

27:20.441 --> 27:22.466
I know exactly what I'm doing.

27:22.810 --> 27:25.904
You're not taking the girl.
You're not taking anyone.

27:26.747 --> 27:30.046
And if your boss doesn't
like it, he can talk to me.

27:30.350 --> 27:31.874
What's going on here?

27:31.985 --> 27:34.078
He says he wants to
see the boss.

27:34.621 --> 27:35.815
All right.

27:39.326 --> 27:40.384
Hey you.

27:40.494 --> 27:43.088
You call yourself the boss.
Well, let me tell you something...

27:43.163 --> 27:44.824
you're not taking any hostages.

27:44.898 --> 27:47.560
Armed robbery is bad enough.
But kidnapping.

27:47.634 --> 27:49.761
That's a federal offense, buddy.

27:49.837 --> 27:50.963
Dorchester.

27:51.572 --> 27:55.804
I was working at a bank part-time to
help my cousin, Reginald, through school.

27:56.043 --> 27:58.375
They wore masks
and took a hostage.

27:58.712 --> 28:01.180
They took all the cash
on hand...

28:01.415 --> 28:04.782
but, stupidly, left some
negotiable bonds behind.

28:06.553 --> 28:08.214
Quite similar to these.

28:09.423 --> 28:11.687
All right. All right.

28:12.159 --> 28:13.888
Maybe we can make a deal.

28:14.628 --> 28:16.619
You don't take any hostages...

28:17.531 --> 28:19.726
and we'll hand over
those negotiable bonds.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.926
They're not.

28:24.171 --> 28:25.900
Those bonds aren't negotiable.

28:25.973 --> 28:28.066
<i>But, of course, they
had no way of knowing that.</i>

28:28.141 --> 28:31.975
And if you hadn't told them, they'd be
out cashing clues all over the city...

28:32.045 --> 28:34.036
and we'd have some way
of tracking them down.

28:34.114 --> 28:35.274
How was I supposed to know that?

28:35.349 --> 28:37.044
I thought you were just
handing out money.

28:37.117 --> 28:38.778
Oh, get out of here, man.
You gotta-

28:38.852 --> 28:40.080
Here's your brandy,
Mr. Higgins.

28:40.153 --> 28:41.142
Thank you.

28:41.655 --> 28:43.589
Well, I think
I'll be going home, now.

28:43.657 --> 28:45.318
Keoki, I know you've had
a rough night...

28:45.392 --> 28:47.292
but I'd sure like to
hear your side of it.

28:47.361 --> 28:50.057
I really didn't see much. I was
behind the bar most of the time.

28:50.130 --> 28:52.155
If I may finally be
allowed to speak...

28:52.232 --> 28:54.223
you will have the correct
sequence of events...

28:54.301 --> 28:55.666
as they happened.

28:55.836 --> 28:57.804
As you saw them, you mean.

28:57.871 --> 28:59.338
As they happened.

29:04.478 --> 29:06.412
To begin at the beginning.

29:11.351 --> 29:13.785
It was closing time and Joy
Kelly was just finishing up...

29:13.854 --> 29:15.446
her last set at the piano.

29:16.356 --> 29:20.452
<i>Although I was tired and longed for
nothing more than a quiet brandy at home...</i>

29:20.527 --> 29:24.122
<i>things unfortunately had reached such
a deplorable state at the Club...</i>

29:24.197 --> 29:26.722
<i>that my assistance
was desperately required.</i>

29:26.800 --> 29:29.325
Hey, barkeep,
how about those drinks?

29:31.638 --> 29:34.004
So I forgot to make
the deposit at the bank.

29:34.074 --> 29:36.474
One day's deposit
may be overlooked.

29:36.777 --> 29:39.302
But an entire week's
worth of receipts?

29:39.379 --> 29:41.779
A day, a week.
What's the big deal?

29:41.848 --> 29:43.782
I was gonna take care
of it tomorrow.

29:43.850 --> 29:46.910
A week, I might add, in which more
money has been spent at the Club...

29:46.987 --> 29:49.046
than any other
this entire fiscal year.

29:49.122 --> 29:52.216
So one Arab spends a little
cash. Jeez, everybody goes crazy.

29:52.292 --> 29:55.284
We're just lucky I was able to
get as good a CPA as George Wong...

29:55.362 --> 29:57.421
to go over the accounts
on such short notice.

30:03.103 --> 30:07.437
Higgins, just as long as you're here,
tell Joy that today is her last day.

30:08.141 --> 30:09.972
You're firing Joy Kelly?

30:10.043 --> 30:11.101
Yeah.

30:11.178 --> 30:12.702
You can't do that.

30:12.980 --> 30:14.607
She's got three children
to feed.

30:14.681 --> 30:16.376
She's got house payments.
She's got-

30:16.450 --> 30:17.747
No talent.

30:18.085 --> 30:19.712
Did you hear how
she murdered <i>Feelings?</i>

30:19.786 --> 30:21.947
That
happens to be my favorite song.

30:22.022 --> 30:26.288
No doubt. If you want to
fire Miss Kelly, you tell her.

30:26.827 --> 30:28.818
Rick, that was Mrs. Halloway.

30:28.862 --> 30:32.161
She's about a quarter mile down
the street in a phone booth.

30:32.199 --> 30:34.167
She got a flat tire
on her way home.

30:34.301 --> 30:37.236
What am I supposed to do? Hike
through the dark and change it?

30:37.304 --> 30:40.330
She's one of our charter members.
We must do something to help.

30:40.407 --> 30:43.069
I got to do everything. Make
the deposits, fire the singer...

30:43.143 --> 30:44.132
fix flat tires.

30:44.211 --> 30:45.200
I'll send Max.

30:45.312 --> 30:46.301
Good.

30:46.847 --> 30:48.337
Give me T.C.'s check.

30:49.149 --> 30:50.275
Thanks.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.784
Well, I'll go see how George
is doing with the accounts.

30:52.853 --> 30:55.447
I'll talk to George.
You talk to Joy.

30:59.660 --> 31:02.788
Please, Higgins.
I don't know how to tell her.

31:03.163 --> 31:05.188
You're really good with words.

31:07.567 --> 31:08.829
Oh, very well.

31:09.102 --> 31:11.502
Thanks, Higgins, thanks.
I'll never forget.

31:11.571 --> 31:13.095
I owe you one for this.
Thank you.

31:19.513 --> 31:20.707
Miss Kelly.

31:20.881 --> 31:21.870
Oh.

31:22.683 --> 31:24.344
Hi, Higgie, honey.

31:25.619 --> 31:26.779
Miss Kelly.

31:28.121 --> 31:30.146
I'm afraid I have some rather...

31:31.024 --> 31:32.855
disappointing news for you.

31:32.926 --> 31:34.553
I didn't get the raise?

31:34.628 --> 31:35.686
Raise?

31:35.762 --> 31:38.128
Ricky promised me a raise.

31:38.899 --> 31:40.161
I'm afraid...

31:40.967 --> 31:43.595
How to soften the blow?
I'm afraid you are...

31:44.938 --> 31:46.064
terminated.

31:46.773 --> 31:47.865
Terminated?

31:48.241 --> 31:50.300
Terminated?
What do you mean terminated?

31:50.377 --> 31:53.210
We won't be needing you
after tonight.

31:54.081 --> 31:55.878
What did I do wrong?

31:56.316 --> 31:58.807
Is it the material?
You don't like the material?

31:58.885 --> 32:03.322
No, no. The material,
your act is quite adequate.

32:03.690 --> 32:06.523
My piano playing. I knew I
should have took piano lessons.

32:06.593 --> 32:08.754
No, no.
It isn't your piano playing.

32:08.829 --> 32:11.764
My costume.
You don't like my costume?

32:12.065 --> 32:15.125
Well, perhaps the costume
could be a touch more...

32:15.302 --> 32:16.496
More what?

32:17.804 --> 32:18.998
Just more.

32:20.707 --> 32:22.038
Ricky.

32:22.476 --> 32:25.536
Forget it, Joy. If Higgins
says you're out, you're out.

32:26.613 --> 32:30.140
You can't fire me. I've never
been fired in my whole life.

32:30.584 --> 32:31.846
I'll just quit.

32:31.918 --> 32:34.148
Please, Miss Kelly,
try not to take it so hard.

32:34.221 --> 32:37.987
I'll make some phone calls, see if we
can't place you at another club somewhere.

32:38.058 --> 32:39.047
Where?

32:39.960 --> 32:43.418
Well, I don't know. I do have a
friend who owns a club on the Mainland.

32:43.497 --> 32:45.226
Vegas?
No.

32:45.699 --> 32:48.463
Tahoe? Reno?
Atlantic City? Where?

32:48.668 --> 32:49.726
Cleveland.

32:49.803 --> 32:51.134
Freeze suckers.

32:51.404 --> 32:53.599
Move it. Come on, move it.

32:53.673 --> 32:54.867
Move it, come on.

32:54.941 --> 32:56.067
You, too.

32:58.612 --> 33:00.045
Oh, my God.

33:01.798 --> 33:03.288
<i>I met the brigands' threats...</i>

33:03.367 --> 33:04.698
<i>with the aplomb and alacrity...</i>

33:04.768 --> 33:07.794
<i>that only a man of my considerable
experience could summon up.</i>

33:07.871 --> 33:09.099
<i>I bided my time...</i>

33:09.172 --> 33:11.732
<i>picked the exact moment when
they were most vulnerable...</i>

33:11.808 --> 33:14.902
<i>and nearly succeeded in resolving
the situation right then and there.</i>

33:19.316 --> 33:20.476
Hold it!

33:21.852 --> 33:23.376
What's going on here?

33:24.488 --> 33:27.082
These blackguards made
a foolish attempt to rob us.

33:27.157 --> 33:29.421
Fortunately, I have
everything under control.

33:29.493 --> 33:30.960
Get them over here.

33:38.302 --> 33:39.667
I dare you.

33:39.736 --> 33:41.863
Don't push your luck, sucker.

33:41.939 --> 33:43.531
You aren't man enough to shoot.

33:43.941 --> 33:47.934
Only a craven coward would be pathetic
enough to hide behind a pig mask.

33:48.178 --> 33:49.338
Coward.

33:49.413 --> 33:50.607
Cool it, or I'll-

33:50.681 --> 33:54.674
Or you'll what? Take off that absurd
disguise and shoot me like a man...

33:54.751 --> 33:56.013
if you dare.

33:56.219 --> 33:57.652
Everybody freeze!

33:59.222 --> 34:00.450
Oh, my!

34:07.130 --> 34:09.223
T.C., go behind the bar
and administer first aid.

34:09.299 --> 34:10.322
Yes, sir.

34:10.400 --> 34:13.563
Wait! Hey, Shorty,
where's the bread?

34:14.538 --> 34:17.029
It's in the office, Mr. Pig.
I'll get it for you.

34:17.107 --> 34:18.096
Rick.

34:20.409 --> 34:21.877
I don't want to die.

34:22.579 --> 34:24.444
Come on, shrimp,
let's get back there.

34:24.514 --> 34:27.312
Now, may T.C. look after our
wounded comrade?

34:27.551 --> 34:29.280
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

34:36.726 --> 34:41.596
Gentlemen, and I use that term
in its broadest possible sense.

34:42.766 --> 34:47.100
I must inform you that your only rational
alternative to lengthy incarceration...

34:47.304 --> 34:49.498
is to quickly lay down
your weapons.

34:49.840 --> 34:53.900
I will personally see to it that the
prosecutors take into consideration...

34:53.976 --> 34:57.174
any mitigating circumstances which may
have caused you to enter into this...

34:57.247 --> 34:59.841
utterly foolhardy
and hopeless act.

35:00.050 --> 35:02.041
Now that your ringleader
is away...

35:02.119 --> 35:04.519
and you have the opportunity
to surrender...

35:04.588 --> 35:06.579
I implore you, do so.

35:07.958 --> 35:09.323
What do you say?

35:10.127 --> 35:11.594
Maybe he's got a point.

35:11.662 --> 35:13.823
Maybe we ought to just
do as he says.

35:13.930 --> 35:15.124
I don't know.

35:16.166 --> 35:18.896
I better take him in the back
and see what the boss says.

35:18.969 --> 35:20.129
Yeah, right.

35:20.337 --> 35:21.736
Let's go, please.

35:29.212 --> 35:30.270
Sorry.

35:31.048 --> 35:32.310
After you, sir.

35:46.763 --> 35:48.253
Dispatch the Pig!

35:51.468 --> 35:53.095
Hold it. That's enough.

35:55.739 --> 35:58.230
Nice try, Shorty.
Now get on your feet.

35:59.176 --> 36:00.643
Oh, my nose.

36:00.977 --> 36:03.537
Come, come, man. Stiff
upper lip and all that.

36:04.715 --> 36:06.410
I think I broke my nose.

36:06.583 --> 36:08.278
Don't crack in front of them.

36:08.351 --> 36:10.842
Stop crying, will you?
Sit down.

36:14.224 --> 36:17.125
Go watch the others. I'll
get the rest of the money.

36:21.465 --> 36:22.659
I think I've got a plan.

36:22.733 --> 36:24.098
Who cares?

36:24.167 --> 36:28.160
Just follow my lead and we'll trick
them into leaving clues all over town.

36:29.106 --> 36:31.040
Higgins,
you've got to stop them.

36:31.108 --> 36:33.736
They're gonna take hostages.
You've got to do something.

36:33.810 --> 36:35.801
There's no need
to take hostages.

36:36.146 --> 36:37.943
That would be a federal offense.

36:38.715 --> 36:40.342
Just take all the cash.

36:41.585 --> 36:45.988
And don't forget to take any negotiable
securities that happen to be lying around.

36:46.823 --> 36:47.983
Like these.

36:48.058 --> 36:49.252
Give me those.

36:51.128 --> 36:54.586
Higgins, it's not like you
to make a mistake.

36:55.165 --> 36:57.224
Those aren't negotiable bonds.

36:57.667 --> 36:58.929
They are not?

36:59.102 --> 37:01.593
Hey, look, we are tired
of your tricks.

37:02.606 --> 37:04.574
Go get the others
and bring them in here.

37:04.641 --> 37:05.630
Okay.

37:05.709 --> 37:07.700
We'll tie them all up together.

37:08.111 --> 37:10.375
<i>And so they tied us up...</i>

37:10.514 --> 37:13.642
<i>took Keoki with them as a
hostage, and left us there.</i>

37:14.317 --> 37:16.046
And that's the way it was.

37:16.319 --> 37:19.482
That's it? They tied you
up and left you there?

37:20.557 --> 37:22.388
Yep. That's the way
I remember it.

37:22.459 --> 37:23.585
Yeah, me, too.

37:23.660 --> 37:24.991
What kind of rope?
Hemp.

37:25.061 --> 37:26.392
Nylon.
Twine.

37:29.599 --> 37:32.159
I don't know, Magnum.
They took me with them.

37:32.302 --> 37:34.133
Dumped me a few blocks away.

37:34.404 --> 37:37.066
I called the cops and came
back as quick as I could.

37:37.140 --> 37:38.129
By that time-

37:38.208 --> 37:39.698
Tanaka and his boys were here.

37:39.776 --> 37:41.471
Right.

37:43.980 --> 37:47.472
So, that puts us right back
where we started.

37:48.185 --> 37:50.881
No suspects, no nothing.

37:50.987 --> 37:52.978
Oh, we have suspects.

37:53.156 --> 37:55.386
You guys may not realize it...

37:55.659 --> 37:58.287
but you said some things
that were very contradictory.

37:58.361 --> 38:01.660
I told you we shouldn't have started
to talk about this in the first place.

38:01.731 --> 38:02.789
I didn't say nothing.

38:02.866 --> 38:03.890
Really, Magnum...

38:03.967 --> 38:06.834
I don't see how you can come up
with any suspects out of that jumble.

38:06.903 --> 38:10.395
Well, there was Rosine, for
instance. And George Wong.

38:10.473 --> 38:13.465
The three of you guys for that
matter, and there's Keoki here.

38:13.543 --> 38:16.774
Keoki? Come on, Thomas,
Keoki stood up to those guys.

38:16.847 --> 38:18.144
And the three of us?

38:18.215 --> 38:20.683
A good investigator
never overlooks the obvious...

38:20.750 --> 38:23.583
and he never even gave me
a chance to get to Joy Kelly.

38:23.653 --> 38:25.780
How do you come up
with Joy Kelly?

38:26.122 --> 38:28.022
Those little inconsistencies.

38:28.825 --> 38:30.918
Now, it was closing time...

38:31.461 --> 38:34.089
and Joy was just finishing
her last song:

38:34.164 --> 38:37.292
<i>One For My Baby
and One More For The Road.</i>

38:37.400 --> 38:39.595
* So set 'em up, Joe *

38:40.470 --> 38:43.200
* I've got a little story *

38:43.273 --> 38:46.572
* You ought to know **

38:46.643 --> 38:49.271
<i>Wait a minute.
She was singing</i> Feelings.

38:49.479 --> 38:51.140
Yeah, he's right.

38:51.248 --> 38:53.239
I heard her. It was
kind of a soul version.

38:53.316 --> 38:55.944
Joy Kelly finishes her
last set every night with...

38:56.019 --> 38:59.352
<i>One For My Baby and One More
For The Road.</i> Everybody knows that.

38:59.422 --> 39:02.186
You're right. But I could've sworn
she was singing <i>Feelings.</i>

39:02.259 --> 39:03.248
That's right.

39:03.326 --> 39:04.315
Oh, yeah?

39:05.962 --> 39:08.260
Why would she change her
closing song?

39:08.331 --> 39:12.199
I have no idea why, but I can assure
you that's what she was singing.

39:13.536 --> 39:14.594
I've got it.

39:14.671 --> 39:17.299
She was signaling the robbers to
tell them that the coast was clear.

39:17.374 --> 39:19.205
Thomas, you're brilliant.

39:19.276 --> 39:23.713
No. Someone named Spencer Nelson
offered her <i>$</i> 100 tip to sing <i>Feelings.</i>

39:24.381 --> 39:25.712
Who's Spencer Nelson?

39:25.782 --> 39:27.613
Cattle King
from Wichita, Kansas...

39:27.684 --> 39:29.914
and a member of the Board
of Directors of this Club.

39:29.986 --> 39:33.387
Here on his second honeymoon
with his delightful wife, Glenda.

39:34.357 --> 39:37.884
Oh, yeah. The couple in
the matching aloha outfit.

39:38.261 --> 39:40.786
So what if she didn't signal
the robbers, Higgins.

39:40.864 --> 39:43.332
You have to admit, it was an
inconsistency and there are others...

39:43.400 --> 39:46.062
and one of them is going to
lead us to our inside man.

39:46.136 --> 39:47.228
Like what?

39:47.871 --> 39:50.738
Like, I'm starting to get
the hang of this, Thomas.

39:52.175 --> 39:54.109
Like that lady
that you were with.

39:54.177 --> 39:55.371
Yeah, what about her?

39:55.445 --> 39:58.881
Maybe she signaled the robbers when
you got up to get her another drink.

39:58.949 --> 40:01.383
Yeah, well, maybe you'd like
to think again, lizard lips.

40:01.451 --> 40:04.579
It was my idea for us to meet
here. I had to give her directions.

40:04.654 --> 40:07.521
She had never even heard
of the King Kamehameha Club.

40:07.590 --> 40:10.150
Rick, when you
went to the bar...

40:10.226 --> 40:12.126
you said Keoki
answered the phone.

40:12.529 --> 40:15.157
Yeah.
Mrs. Halloway called.

40:15.598 --> 40:18.692
Unless, it wasn't
Mrs. Halloway calling at all.

40:18.768 --> 40:20.360
You think someone else called...

40:20.437 --> 40:22.667
as a ruse to get rid of
the security guard? Yes.

40:22.739 --> 40:24.934
Who on earth would sound
like Mrs. Halloway?

40:25.008 --> 40:27.806
We must ask Keoki
if he recognized the voice.

40:28.578 --> 40:29.567
Rick?

40:29.713 --> 40:32.614
George Wong! It's him!
It had to be him.

40:32.782 --> 40:35.046
He was as nervous as a ninth
grader out on his first date.

40:35.118 --> 40:36.449
It's Wong.
Wrong.

40:36.519 --> 40:37.713
Look in all the excitement...

40:37.787 --> 40:39.812
I forgot that he put this
piece of paper in this pad...

40:39.889 --> 40:41.254
right before the robbery.

40:42.859 --> 40:43.951
What does it say?

40:44.027 --> 40:47.827
Just the names of all the guys who were
hiding behind the masks, that's all.

40:48.365 --> 40:49.662
Tell me those aren't names?

40:49.733 --> 40:51.598
Sam, Kirby, George Jr.

40:51.668 --> 40:54.865
George Wong's wife is expecting
their first child at any moment.

40:54.938 --> 40:56.428
That's why he's nervous.

40:56.506 --> 40:59.202
Those are merely potential
names for the child.

41:01.845 --> 41:04.143
Well, he still could be
the inside man.

41:04.647 --> 41:05.636
Unless...

41:07.384 --> 41:08.851
You don't think...

41:15.191 --> 41:16.180
No.

41:17.260 --> 41:18.249
No.

41:20.263 --> 41:22.322
I've been looking
at this all wrong.

41:22.399 --> 41:26.631
I've been looking at what was different in
your stories instead of what was the same.

41:26.703 --> 41:29.297
Yes, there's no need to go
through everything again, is there?

41:29.372 --> 41:32.466
No, not at all. Because the one
thing that's exactly the same...

41:32.542 --> 41:36.945
in all your stories is
what happened to your clothes.

41:37.247 --> 41:38.271
We didn't tell you that.

41:38.348 --> 41:39.372
I know.

41:39.449 --> 41:40.916
And we aren't going to.

41:40.984 --> 41:42.349
Oh, yes, you are.
You have to.

41:42.419 --> 41:45.388
Because somehow, somewhere,
in that piece of the story...

41:45.455 --> 41:49.619
that you all left out, is the clue that's
going to lead us to our inside man.

41:52.929 --> 41:54.226
Come on, guys.

41:56.199 --> 41:57.530
Oh, very well.

41:57.801 --> 41:58.893
Higgins.

41:58.968 --> 42:01.334
He's not going to be satisfied
until he's wormed it out of us.

42:01.404 --> 42:03.804
We might as well
tell him what happened.

42:04.240 --> 42:06.140
You better not embellish
on this, Higgins.

42:06.209 --> 42:07.335
I shan't.

42:10.580 --> 42:15.017
Apparently, there was one oversight
that our bemasked captors had made.

42:15.652 --> 42:17.711
They neglected
to bring any rope.

42:17.787 --> 42:20.119
So they brought all of
the others into the room...

42:20.190 --> 42:22.420
ordered us to
take our clothes off...

42:23.326 --> 42:26.557
and left us there
in that utterly ignoble state.

42:32.268 --> 42:34.065
I hope you're satisfied.

42:34.270 --> 42:35.259
Not yet.

42:35.505 --> 42:37.598
I said take it all off.

42:40.410 --> 42:41.707
Shut up!

42:41.911 --> 42:44.709
Good God, man.
You can't be serious.

42:44.948 --> 42:47.109
Do you realize what
you're asking us to do?

42:47.183 --> 42:49.310
Have you no sense
of human decency?

42:49.385 --> 42:51.285
Of compassion? Of morality?

42:51.688 --> 42:55.124
I, for one, will not meekly
submit to this final degradation.

42:55.592 --> 42:57.150
I refuse.

43:05.602 --> 43:09.060
On the other hand, there's no
sense in being foolish, is there?

43:11.875 --> 43:13.570
Now put them over there.

43:15.411 --> 43:19.074
Keoki, pick up their clothes
on the way out.

43:19.883 --> 43:21.043
Bring them with you.

43:21.117 --> 43:22.778
<i>Wait a minute. Stop!</i>

43:22.852 --> 43:23.910
<i>What?</i>

43:23.987 --> 43:26.285
Go back a little bit.
What did he say?

43:26.856 --> 43:30.314
He said, "Keoki, you pick up their
clothes and bring them with you."

43:30.393 --> 43:32.588
Are you sure that's
exactly what he said? Yes.

43:32.662 --> 43:34.892
"Keoki, you pick up their
clothes and bring them with you."

43:34.964 --> 43:35.953
Yes.

43:38.568 --> 43:40.297
How did Porky know his name?

43:40.670 --> 43:41.967
Oh, so what?

43:42.672 --> 43:44.435
You're way off base
this time, Thomas.

43:44.507 --> 43:45.667
I don't think so.

43:46.943 --> 43:49.605
It couldn't have been Keoki. I
mean, they knocked him out cold.

43:49.679 --> 43:50.771
Unless they didn't.

43:50.847 --> 43:52.041
No, I saw him.

43:52.549 --> 43:54.380
You also saw something else.

44:03.193 --> 44:04.524
This makeup kit.

44:04.694 --> 44:06.286
That's Joy's.

44:08.498 --> 44:09.556
Or yours.

44:10.266 --> 44:11.790
Is that really a black eye,
Keoki...

44:11.868 --> 44:13.927
or just a real good make up job?

44:15.405 --> 44:16.531
Nobody move.

44:17.407 --> 44:20.865
Keoki, how could you do this?
I hired you.

44:21.878 --> 44:24.278
Hey, man, I thought
we were your friends.

44:26.149 --> 44:27.275
Hand my gun over.

44:27.350 --> 44:28.749
Hey, don't move any closer.

44:28.818 --> 44:31.116
I don't want to
have to hurt you guys.

44:31.688 --> 44:34.179
You've been with the Club
all these years.

44:34.824 --> 44:37.292
You started out as a janitor,
busboy...

44:37.527 --> 44:39.222
worked your way
up to desserts...

44:39.295 --> 44:41.388
salads, waiter, head bartender.

44:41.864 --> 44:43.889
I don't understand. Why?

44:44.834 --> 44:47.268
Why would you do
such a heinous thing?

44:48.137 --> 44:49.263
Why?

44:51.341 --> 44:52.808
I needed the money.

44:55.578 --> 44:56.567
Keoki...

44:57.981 --> 44:59.346
give me the gun.

45:11.794 --> 45:13.785
Nice going, Magnum.

45:14.664 --> 45:16.222
Astonishing.

45:17.567 --> 45:18.829
Wait a second.

45:19.135 --> 45:23.037
You just happened to drop in at the
exact right moment to hear all of this?

45:24.607 --> 45:27.906
He didn't just happened
to drop in, T.C.

45:27.977 --> 45:30.275
He knew that it was only
a matter of time...

45:30.346 --> 45:33.372
before I figured out the true
identity of the inside man.

45:33.449 --> 45:35.713
So, naturally, he was
standing by to pick him up.

45:35.785 --> 45:37.047
Not exactly.

45:37.387 --> 45:40.083
I kind of felt bad for you
holding the bag.

45:40.223 --> 45:44.387
So I had the boys drop me off to give
you the final score of the Tigers game.

45:44.961 --> 45:47.259
Tigers, six to five.

45:52.568 --> 45:55.093
Naturally, as a member
of the Board of Directors...

45:55.171 --> 45:58.538
I felt it was incumbent upon me to
stay until every possible clue...

45:58.608 --> 46:00.132
had been thoroughly examined.

46:00.209 --> 46:01.267
Actually, I was responsible...

46:01.344 --> 46:02.436
for the really important stuff.

46:03.513 --> 46:04.502
Thank you.

46:05.348 --> 46:08.579
Well, Keoki gave us the names
of the three men in masks...

46:08.751 --> 46:10.810
and signed
a complete confession.

46:10.887 --> 46:13.151
Seems like he had
a real gambling problem.

46:13.323 --> 46:14.881
Was in way over his head.

46:14.957 --> 46:18.984
Guy he was into threatened his
family, then gave him an out.

46:19.162 --> 46:20.186
The robbery.

46:20.263 --> 46:21.252
Yeah.

46:21.331 --> 46:22.457
Funny thing is...

46:22.532 --> 46:26.730
the bet he placed on tonight's
Tigers game would've pulled him out.

46:30.540 --> 46:31.632
You should have heard
them out there...

46:31.708 --> 46:34.302
both trying to take credit
for having solving this thing.

46:34.377 --> 46:36.709
Don't worry, Thomas. I gave a
complete statement to the press.

46:36.779 --> 46:38.679
Complete perhaps,
hardly accurate.

46:38.748 --> 46:42.115
Don't worry, Higgins. I won't
tell anybody you made stuff up.

46:42.618 --> 46:44.643
Well, I guess that's about
all we can do here.

46:44.721 --> 46:46.916
It's time for everyone to go
home and get some shut eye.

46:46.989 --> 46:48.183
We could sure all use it.

46:48.257 --> 46:49.781
Wait a minute.
Come on guys, I mean.

46:49.859 --> 46:52.987
So what if the robbers made
you take off your clothes.

46:53.062 --> 46:55.189
I mean, why all the secrecy?

46:55.264 --> 46:56.993
I can't see why you wouldn't
tell me that.

46:57.066 --> 46:58.055
We did tell you.

46:58.167 --> 47:00.431
Well yeah, but after I
practically dragged it out of you.

47:00.503 --> 47:03.472
It's like the three of you had
some sort of pact of secrecy...

47:03.539 --> 47:06.565
not to tell me the end of the
story. What's the big deal?

47:06.642 --> 47:09.668
The big deal is that that's
not the end of the story.

47:09.879 --> 47:11.938
Oh. What's the end
of the story?

47:12.382 --> 47:15.545
Thomas, you've already solved
the crime. Forget the rest.

47:15.685 --> 47:17.050
Yeah, what's the end
of the story?

47:17.120 --> 47:19.281
I believe I could sleep
for <i>4</i> 8 hours straight.

47:19.355 --> 47:20.549
Can I give anyone a lift?

47:20.623 --> 47:22.784
No thanks, I got the Vanagon
outside. Bye.

47:22.859 --> 47:24.793
What's the end of the story?

47:24.861 --> 47:28.922
Hey, forget the end of
that story. It's history.

47:30.199 --> 47:32.394
Magnum, put on a pot of coffee.

47:32.769 --> 47:34.703
We may have a murder to solve.
