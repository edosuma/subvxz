02:15.891 --> 02:17.292
<i>Dada.</i>

02:20.028 --> 02:22.062
All right, all quiet.

02:27.537 --> 02:29.470
<i>Da-da!</i>

02:31.006 --> 02:32.341
I'm here, honey.

02:41.016 --> 02:43.350
<i>Da-da.</i>

02:43.352 --> 02:44.987
What you doin', Willow?

02:45.654 --> 02:48.523
<i>Da-da! Da!</i>

02:48.525 --> 02:49.890
<i>Da!</i>

04:08.237 --> 04:09.469
<i>Da-da.</i>

04:10.839 --> 04:13.173
Yeah?

04:13.175 --> 04:15.175
What you doin', Willow?

04:15.177 --> 04:17.478
Hmm?

06:02.384 --> 06:03.618
Hmm?

06:06.421 --> 06:07.689
Mmm.

06:09.524 --> 06:11.890
Mmm, mmm-hmm.

06:11.892 --> 06:13.793
One, two, three.

06:15.731 --> 06:18.633
Hey...
There you go.

06:19.768 --> 06:21.801
There you go.

06:21.803 --> 06:24.306
Do a little pee-pee.

06:25.407 --> 06:27.574
There you go.
There you go.

06:29.043 --> 06:31.313
Aw...

06:32.581 --> 06:34.748
Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.718
What's going on?
What's going on?

06:39.488 --> 06:41.221
Hey.

06:41.223 --> 06:42.923
Shh. Hey.

06:54.469 --> 06:55.470
All done.

07:14.423 --> 07:16.358
Hey.

07:18.159 --> 07:20.025
Hey.

07:20.027 --> 07:21.329
Everything's okay.

07:29.471 --> 07:31.270
Here, bubba.

07:33.642 --> 07:34.975
Who's this?

07:42.851 --> 07:45.286
Don't drink
your own piss, Willow.

07:49.957 --> 07:53.127
And don't eat your own shit.

07:57.566 --> 07:59.734
Even if it's recycled...

08:03.070 --> 08:07.208
...even if it doesn't
look like piss or shit

08:07.843 --> 08:09.041
anymore.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.582
It's called a taboo.

08:19.688 --> 08:21.923
Ta-boo.

08:24.391 --> 08:28.360
Ta... Boo.

08:28.362 --> 08:30.998
Hang thee, my little baggage.

08:41.576 --> 08:42.844
Man.

08:43.344 --> 08:44.677
Ah!

08:44.679 --> 08:45.881
Taboo.

08:46.413 --> 08:48.280
Taboo.

08:48.282 --> 08:50.282
Taboo.

08:50.284 --> 08:51.552
Taboo.

08:52.621 --> 08:54.188
At least it is for me.

08:55.222 --> 08:57.926
But not for you.
Not for you.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.027
Not for you.

09:04.031 --> 09:05.399
Sweet little girl.

09:08.202 --> 09:10.304
If my old man
could see me now...

09:13.607 --> 09:15.042
"Break the laws of nature,

09:16.645 --> 09:18.112
"and you'll pay for it...

09:19.413 --> 09:21.415
"...you little
son of a bitch.

09:22.784 --> 09:24.318
"You little son of a bitch."

09:27.288 --> 09:29.891
Wait for me.

09:30.759 --> 09:33.494
Wait!
Come on!

09:34.996 --> 09:37.164
Hey,
wait for me!

09:47.107 --> 09:48.509

11:12.060 --> 11:13.892
I have to go
and feed the dog.

11:49.596 --> 11:51.532
ID 149 reporting.

11:54.802 --> 11:57.235
I removed the defective section

11:57.237 --> 11:59.738
of the external magnetic panel

11:59.740 --> 12:02.409
and replaced it with
one of my own making.

12:03.243 --> 12:05.043
To save electric energy,

12:05.045 --> 12:07.815
I've decided to jettison
everything that's unnecessary.

12:09.083 --> 12:10.882
I'm fully aware
of the consequences.

12:10.884 --> 12:14.720
The child's in good health
and, uh, so am I.

12:14.722 --> 12:17.622
My blood work is normal,
my eyesight is stable.

12:17.624 --> 12:20.992
And, oh, even if I don't
see me play this message

12:20.994 --> 12:23.995
for 100 years, fuck you.

12:23.997 --> 12:25.297
Over and out.

16:45.192 --> 16:46.726
So light, Mink.

16:48.928 --> 16:49.929
It's barely even here.

19:15.708 --> 19:18.809
Come on, come on, come on.

19:18.811 --> 19:19.979
Come on, come on.

19:20.580 --> 19:22.079
No.

19:22.081 --> 19:25.883
So many tears
in just a tiny little body.

19:25.885 --> 19:28.586
Would you stop it, please?
Please, please,

19:28.588 --> 19:30.254
stop it, stop it, please.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.655
Please. It's gonna kill me.

19:31.657 --> 19:33.190
It's gonna kill me.

19:33.192 --> 19:34.592
It's gonna kill me.

19:34.594 --> 19:35.928
Please.

19:37.363 --> 19:38.664
Okay?

19:44.503 --> 19:45.504
Hey.

19:48.575 --> 19:50.042
Hmm.

19:50.610 --> 19:52.178
Hmm. Hmm.

20:11.964 --> 20:13.866
I'm afraid, Willow.

20:23.442 --> 20:26.145
Mmm, I could've just
drowned you like a kitten.

20:27.446 --> 20:29.215
It'd be so easy.

20:36.288 --> 20:38.557
It should be you first
and then me.

21:27.106 --> 21:29.508
<i>These fucking
images from Earth.</i>

21:31.644 --> 21:34.280
<i>I can't believe
they still make it here.</i>

21:35.547 --> 21:37.149
<i>After all this time.</i>

21:38.884 --> 21:40.219
<i>Just like</i>

21:41.553 --> 21:45.457
<i>viruses chasing after us.</i>

21:54.967 --> 21:56.667
<i>Parasites.</i>

22:02.474 --> 22:04.641
<i>I'm holding up.</i>

22:04.643 --> 22:06.011
<i>I've held up.</i>

22:08.147 --> 22:09.982
<i>I never caved in.</i>

22:13.185 --> 22:14.720
<i>I'll hold up.</i>

22:20.059 --> 22:21.393
<i>She's mine.</i>

22:25.897 --> 22:27.232
<i>I'm hers.</i>

22:39.378 --> 22:40.713
<i>Fuck.</i>

22:55.527 --> 22:57.860
<i>Since we left
the solar system,</i>

22:57.862 --> 22:59.198
<i>radio silence.</i>

23:00.031 --> 23:01.266
<i>Nothing.</i>

23:02.468 --> 23:05.137
<i>Those random images.</i>

23:06.904 --> 23:10.908
<i>Maybe they were programmed
to keep us on a leash.</i>

23:14.145 --> 23:16.815
<i>Make us believe
a return was possible.</i>

23:22.987 --> 23:24.623
<i>We invented rituals.</i>

23:26.792 --> 23:28.494
<i>Hygiene first.</i>

23:54.620 --> 23:55.852
Here.

25:08.993 --> 25:12.564
Kali Yuga, the final...
The final age of man.

25:14.198 --> 25:15.832
Did you know that

25:15.834 --> 25:19.068
I still have leopards
on the street where I live?

25:19.070 --> 25:22.338
Professor, I'm surprised
you've accepted an invitation

25:22.340 --> 25:25.508
to attend a conference
in such a cold country.

25:25.510 --> 25:28.747
What made you leave your
Assamese hills and say yes?

25:31.215 --> 25:33.349
Curiosity.

25:33.351 --> 25:36.622
But you have a more serious
reason for coming, don't you?

25:38.456 --> 25:39.625
Yes.

25:41.058 --> 25:42.460
Yes, indeed.

25:44.061 --> 25:48.063
Radical experiments are
taking place in outer space.

25:48.065 --> 25:51.269
Death row inmates are selected
to be used as guinea pigs.

25:52.738 --> 25:55.604
Is this really how Occidental
governmental authorities

25:55.606 --> 25:57.074
hope to deal with criminals?

25:58.209 --> 26:00.609
I doubt very much.

26:00.611 --> 26:03.715
I mean, they're not being
told the truth about...

26:04.716 --> 26:06.048
About what?

26:06.050 --> 26:07.485
That they will never come back.

26:08.820 --> 26:10.655
We can't even contact them.

26:11.990 --> 26:13.823
Their messages and reports

26:13.825 --> 26:16.327
now take years
to get back to us.

26:18.229 --> 26:20.129
We'll be bone dust

26:20.131 --> 26:22.834
while they're still
hurtling through space.

26:34.645 --> 26:35.814
Yep.

26:36.614 --> 26:37.816
Right.

26:39.150 --> 26:41.785
Oh. Yeah!

26:41.787 --> 26:43.454
All right.

26:44.689 --> 26:45.690
Yep.

26:59.972 --> 27:01.039
Whoop!

27:07.478 --> 27:08.679
Okay.

27:11.315 --> 27:13.182
Aw.

27:13.184 --> 27:14.719
Almost.
Up, up.

27:17.722 --> 27:19.223
Come on.

27:20.025 --> 27:21.059
Up.

27:21.859 --> 27:23.692
Up.

27:23.694 --> 27:26.328
Up. Up. Up.

27:26.330 --> 27:27.832
Da!

28:49.480 --> 28:52.249
<i>We were scum. Trash.</i>

28:53.551 --> 28:55.619
<i>Refuse that didn't
fit into the system</i>

28:57.054 --> 28:59.890
<i>until someone had the
bright idea of recycling us.</i>

29:00.758 --> 29:03.094
<i>Some of us got life sentences,</i>

29:05.429 --> 29:07.164
<i>some of us were on death row.</i>

29:10.501 --> 29:12.169
<i>The agency made us an offer,</i>

29:13.571 --> 29:14.839
<i>to serve science.</i>

29:17.408 --> 29:20.177
<i>Given our ages,
how could we say no?</i>

29:49.272 --> 29:50.806
<i>At that point,</i>

29:50.808 --> 29:53.010
<i>we'd only left the solar system
for three years.</i>

29:54.111 --> 29:57.446
<i>Almost all of us
were still alive.</i>

29:57.448 --> 30:00.883
<i>Constant acceleration
creates artificial gravity,</i>

30:00.885 --> 30:03.319
<i>freeing us from the discomfort
of weightlessness.</i>

30:04.822 --> 30:06.356
<i>The body handles it better.</i>

30:15.733 --> 30:17.666
I don't want a sedative.

30:17.668 --> 30:19.335
You put too much
in the water as it is.

30:38.722 --> 30:40.758
Well, you got me, juicy peach.

30:49.667 --> 30:51.432
They lied to us

30:51.434 --> 30:52.870
and you knew it.

30:53.938 --> 30:55.172
You knew it.

30:58.042 --> 31:00.211
Fucking second-chance doctor.

31:02.880 --> 31:06.081
When I first saw you, you were
a filthy little crackhead.

31:06.083 --> 31:08.185
Now look at you.

31:10.287 --> 31:11.922
A fine specimen.

31:15.893 --> 31:17.628
Fucking child murderer.

31:24.134 --> 31:26.369
Oh, so you do have
a nervous system.

31:27.137 --> 31:28.772
Eh! Look at her!

31:30.274 --> 31:31.372
Look at her!

31:31.374 --> 31:32.440
You're fucking killing her!

31:32.442 --> 31:34.877
Whoa! Calm down!

31:34.879 --> 31:37.946
Don't you realize nothing is
ever gonna grow inside of us?

31:37.948 --> 31:40.450
Oh! Behavior!

31:41.417 --> 31:42.552
Fuck off!

31:47.624 --> 31:49.093
Fucking whore.

32:01.972 --> 32:03.741
Hey. Hey!

32:04.674 --> 32:06.110
Hey, hey, hey.

32:08.112 --> 32:10.014
Hey, uh-uh-uh. Hey.

32:10.948 --> 32:12.446
Mmm-mmm.

32:12.448 --> 32:13.918
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

32:14.584 --> 32:15.652
Hey.

32:17.121 --> 32:19.089
Hey. Uh-uh.

32:22.026 --> 32:23.424
Hey. Mmm-mmm.

32:23.426 --> 32:24.929
It's dirty.

32:25.362 --> 32:26.363
It's dirty.

32:34.637 --> 32:35.638
Mmm.

32:39.977 --> 32:41.979
Hmm.
It's a fresh strawberry.

32:47.217 --> 32:48.218
Hey.

32:48.818 --> 32:49.887
Ah.

32:50.820 --> 32:51.854
Hey.

32:52.156 --> 32:53.223
Ah.

32:58.062 --> 32:59.129
Mmm!

33:01.999 --> 33:04.068
Ready?

33:06.536 --> 33:07.870
Hold on tight.

33:09.173 --> 33:10.871
Hold on tight.
Come here.

33:10.873 --> 33:13.708
Hey. Come on. Hey.

33:17.547 --> 33:19.247
<i>Dr. Dibs,</i>

33:19.249 --> 33:21.749
<i>struggling to harvest
healthy fetuses,</i>

33:21.751 --> 33:23.584
<i>ones that would
survive childbirth.</i>

33:24.721 --> 33:26.489
<i>The guys were in it
for the fix.</i>

34:06.196 --> 34:07.597
What about my treat?

34:08.731 --> 34:09.732
Oh.

34:15.905 --> 34:17.806
Smashing.
Thank you.

34:25.382 --> 34:27.550
Why do you keep
taking their sperm?

34:29.652 --> 34:31.952
Even if you manage to
inseminate one of the girls,

34:31.954 --> 34:33.723
the babies die
from radiation.

34:36.260 --> 34:38.293
The odds
are not in our favor,

34:38.295 --> 34:40.462
but when my work
is accomplished,

34:40.464 --> 34:42.163
when perfection is achieved...

34:42.165 --> 34:43.467
Then what?

34:44.100 --> 34:45.302
Fly away?

34:55.344 --> 34:56.746
<i>Except for me.</i>

35:00.850 --> 35:02.785
<i>I kept my fluids to myself.</i>

35:05.322 --> 35:07.156
<i>She thought she was
doing me a favor.</i>

35:07.990 --> 35:09.192
Someday.

35:10.259 --> 35:11.828
<i>She was cocky that way.</i>

39:51.940 --> 39:53.809
Doesn't seem to be
doing you much good.

39:55.043 --> 39:56.579
Better than you'd think.

39:58.314 --> 40:00.249
God,
it's so humiliating.

40:01.717 --> 40:03.386
You need to wipe your nose.

40:09.625 --> 40:11.260
I know I look like a witch.

40:12.461 --> 40:14.630
I mean, you all call me
Vultura, right?

40:15.798 --> 40:17.600
'Cause you're foxy
and you know it.

40:19.835 --> 40:21.235
I just don't understand

40:21.237 --> 40:23.806
how you can still believe
in your Class-2 mission.

40:25.341 --> 40:28.977
It's like you've become
a shaman of sperm.

40:31.480 --> 40:33.181
It's just a new
religion for you.

40:36.318 --> 40:39.622
Because I'm totally devoted
to reproduction,

40:40.322 --> 40:41.690
happy monk.

40:42.957 --> 40:44.660
Going to sow your fields?

40:55.438 --> 40:57.105
Fucking cock-block.

41:03.879 --> 41:07.881
<i>Like everyone,
I'd used the box,</i>

41:07.883 --> 41:11.854
<i>but as time passed, I chose
abstinence over indulgence.</i>

41:15.990 --> 41:18.461
<i>Chastity was a way
of making myself stronger.</i>

41:26.802 --> 41:28.303
Mr. Blue Nuts.

41:31.172 --> 41:33.007
This monk thing
you got goin' on,

41:33.843 --> 41:35.043
it's cool, huh?

41:36.077 --> 41:37.480
It's so vain.

41:38.313 --> 41:39.815
You bet I'm vain.

41:41.817 --> 41:42.818
I like it here.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.856
This reminds me of juvie.

41:48.022 --> 41:50.191
Reminds me of jail.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.427
It's the same thing
as the army.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.030
I get why
you choose abstinence.

41:57.700 --> 42:00.569
Masturbating, you can...
You can do that to death.

42:01.169 --> 42:02.368
But this fuck box?

42:02.370 --> 42:03.871
Jesus.

42:03.873 --> 42:05.674
That's a whole 'nother
rabbit hole.

42:07.242 --> 42:10.111
You use it.

42:14.249 --> 42:17.085
I made my wife promise
to raise our son gently.

42:19.521 --> 42:20.587
Only thing that makes me happy

42:20.589 --> 42:21.957
is knowing he's gonna be
all right.

42:22.725 --> 42:24.459
Your son is old now,

42:26.394 --> 42:27.730
or he's dead.

42:29.030 --> 42:30.697
This little garden

42:30.699 --> 42:32.635
is teaching me
to enjoy the present.

42:34.369 --> 42:35.905
Nothin' else
really matters, man.

42:37.372 --> 42:40.039
And Tcherny can't be
your real name, right?

42:40.041 --> 42:43.111
Nah. One of the Russian crew
instructors gave it to me.

42:44.312 --> 42:47.315
I think it means black,
but who knows, man?

42:48.316 --> 42:50.116
What's Monte?

42:50.118 --> 42:51.720
Your folks Italian
or somethin'?

42:52.587 --> 42:53.655
Nah.

42:55.156 --> 42:56.926
I was raised by my dog.

43:00.562 --> 43:04.130
I'm tired as a bat,
all this flying around.

43:04.132 --> 43:05.935
I can't do this
space shit no more.

43:14.509 --> 43:17.677
<i>At 99%
of the speed of light,</i>

43:17.679 --> 43:20.181
<i>the entire sky converged
before our eyes.</i>

43:21.749 --> 43:23.951
<i>This sensation,</i>

43:23.953 --> 43:27.322
<i>moving backwards even though
we're moving forwards,</i>

43:28.756 --> 43:30.960
<i>getting farther
from what's getting nearer,</i>

43:32.360 --> 43:34.429
<i>sometimes
I just can't stand it.</i>

44:09.564 --> 44:11.564
<i>According to Dibs,</i>

44:11.566 --> 44:14.003
<i>the captain is ill-equipped
for the stress.</i>

44:15.169 --> 44:17.136
<i>Bad genes.</i>

44:17.138 --> 44:20.306
<i>Leukemia has invaded his body.</i>

44:20.308 --> 44:23.211
<i>His eyes are more sensitive
to the radiation than ours.</i>

44:24.980 --> 44:28.383
<i>Everything he sees
is bathed in a black halo.</i>

44:30.818 --> 44:32.186
<i>I have good genes.</i>

45:25.239 --> 45:26.407
All right.

45:34.382 --> 45:35.750
Fuck off.

45:50.498 --> 45:51.897
Be careful with her!

45:51.899 --> 45:52.900
Yes.

46:02.844 --> 46:04.844
<i>We were
at the halfway point.</i>

46:04.846 --> 46:06.981
<i>Four more years
to our destination.</i>

46:09.417 --> 46:11.417
<i>We had to begin
the deceleration maneuver</i>

46:11.419 --> 46:13.187
<i>so the ship could
approach a black hole,</i>

46:14.522 --> 46:16.290
<i>one of the closest
in our galaxy.</i>

46:17.158 --> 46:18.824
<i>A small one.</i>

46:18.826 --> 46:20.595
<i>This is the main goal
of our mission.</i>

46:23.798 --> 46:25.933
<i>Our Class-1 suicide ride</i>

46:29.971 --> 46:32.874
<i>to check if we could capture
a black hole's rotating energy.</i>

46:34.842 --> 46:37.877
<i>And we, heroes,</i>

46:37.879 --> 46:41.048
<i>would provide humanity with
almost boundless resources.</i>

46:42.950 --> 46:44.619
<i>Their Penrose process.</i>

47:55.189 --> 47:56.423
I want to fuck you.

48:43.170 --> 48:44.404
<i>It stinks.</i>

48:45.907 --> 48:47.474
<i>The usual stench.</i>

48:49.176 --> 48:50.677
<i>It gets me hard.</i>

48:55.582 --> 48:58.185
<i>Tcherny decided to start
sleeping in the garden.</i>

49:13.134 --> 49:15.367
I'm glad I'm so weak.

49:15.369 --> 49:16.969
I'm so happy I'm hemorrhaging.

49:16.971 --> 49:18.436
Be quiet.

49:18.438 --> 49:20.772
Stop lying to yourself.

49:20.774 --> 49:22.607
One day, it'll happen to you.

49:22.609 --> 49:24.176
You're not as strong
as you think you are,

49:24.178 --> 49:25.843
big booty girl.

49:25.845 --> 49:27.714
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

49:29.649 --> 49:30.717
Okay.

50:12.926 --> 50:14.694
- Because you're so...
- Shut the fuck up!

50:15.729 --> 50:17.829
Don't shush me.

50:17.831 --> 50:19.266
- You're so fucking annoying.
- Shh!

50:20.900 --> 50:22.700
Sometimes
I look at you

50:22.702 --> 50:24.604
and I wanna beat your face
into a little pulp.

50:25.839 --> 50:27.705
Your little mouth,

50:27.707 --> 50:30.041
your stupid smile...

50:30.043 --> 50:31.511
That voice.

50:35.782 --> 50:37.949
Hey, stop doing that.

50:37.951 --> 50:39.186
You'll hurt yourself.

50:40.020 --> 50:41.621
Douching is for amateurs.

50:42.922 --> 50:45.424
Do we need to tie you up again?

50:45.426 --> 50:46.860
Come on, go back to sleep.

50:48.229 --> 50:49.230
Good.

50:53.467 --> 50:56.201
God damn slut.

50:56.203 --> 50:59.971
You're a bunch of common
criminals and petty thugs.

50:59.973 --> 51:02.742
My crime was the only one
worthy of the name.

52:21.388 --> 52:23.489
Even up here,

52:23.491 --> 52:25.325
the black ones
are the first to go.

52:37.003 --> 52:38.537
Are you sick?

52:38.539 --> 52:40.705
You wanna clog the machine?
Is that what you want?

52:40.707 --> 52:43.475
- It's what she wanted.
- Don't do that!

52:43.477 --> 52:45.877
You're sick!

52:45.879 --> 52:47.579
- It's all good then!
- Ow!

52:47.581 --> 52:49.182
Don't ever do that again!

53:06.399 --> 53:07.765
Step away.

53:07.767 --> 53:09.767
Fuck your baby mission!

53:09.769 --> 53:12.670
Your hormones
are fucking bullshit.

53:12.672 --> 53:14.707
It's our willpower
that kills the fetuses.

54:06.459 --> 54:08.259
It's a stroke.
Don't tell anyone.

54:09.762 --> 54:11.128
Shit, the report.

54:13.266 --> 54:15.433
<i>He was fucked.</i>

54:15.435 --> 54:18.402
- <i>Maybe we were fucked too.</i>
- It's okay.

54:18.404 --> 54:21.140
<i>The mission.
Everything.</i>

54:55.475 --> 54:58.876
ID 149,
daily progress report.

54:58.878 --> 55:01.279
All systems
in full-functional mode,

55:01.281 --> 55:04.482
all crew members are complying
with mission experiments.

55:04.484 --> 55:05.485
Over and out.

55:30.643 --> 55:32.145
It's time
for lights out.

55:34.747 --> 55:37.984
<i>♪ Always alone</i>

55:40.320 --> 55:43.389
<i>♪ Alone and blue</i>

55:46.892 --> 55:53.433
<i>♪ I've got no one
to share my troubles to</i>

55:56.202 --> 55:59.072
<i>♪ No one to care</i>

56:01.274 --> 56:04.177
<i>♪ To call my own</i>

56:07.213 --> 56:11.850
<i>♪ Seems I must
always be alone ♪</i>

56:20.393 --> 56:22.060
There is nothing to fear.

56:25.030 --> 56:26.098
I promise.

56:32.372 --> 56:34.039
Everything's gonna be fine.

56:47.754 --> 56:50.490
I have no one to help me
like I'm helping you.

56:57.263 --> 56:59.332
No one to put me
out of my misery.

57:03.836 --> 57:05.605
I live alone with my guilt.

57:12.578 --> 57:14.179
Hmm? What?

57:15.314 --> 57:17.448
What?

57:17.450 --> 57:18.484
What?

57:20.787 --> 57:23.086
Suck my dick.

57:26.325 --> 57:27.493
Please.

57:35.468 --> 57:36.669
Shh.

01:00:02.247 --> 01:00:05.081
Fuck off!

01:00:05.083 --> 01:00:07.584
- Get off me!
- Hey, what are you doing?

01:00:07.586 --> 01:00:08.955
Fucking get off me!

01:00:10.121 --> 01:00:12.823
Stop it, you fucker! Stop it!

01:00:24.837 --> 01:00:26.837
Help, help!

01:00:26.839 --> 01:00:28.271
Get off her!

01:00:28.273 --> 01:00:29.808
You sick fuck!

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:32.011
No!

01:00:32.644 --> 01:00:34.644
No! No!

01:00:34.646 --> 01:00:35.982
No!

01:00:44.222 --> 01:00:45.223
Come on!

01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:52.297
Help!

01:00:53.498 --> 01:00:55.832
No!

01:00:55.834 --> 01:00:56.835
Shut the fuck up!

01:00:57.836 --> 01:00:59.005
Hey, hey!

01:00:59.904 --> 01:01:02.074
Help!

01:01:19.691 --> 01:01:22.761
Come on! Take these off!
He broke my nose!

01:01:26.498 --> 01:01:28.733
- Come on.
- I will kill that motherfucker.

01:01:30.435 --> 01:01:31.436
Fuck outta here.

01:01:37.709 --> 01:01:38.910
Come on.

01:01:44.249 --> 01:01:47.016
Fucking...

01:01:47.018 --> 01:01:49.686
Fucking walk!

01:01:49.688 --> 01:01:50.855
Won't you carry me?

01:01:57.696 --> 01:02:00.863
Please!

01:02:00.865 --> 01:02:03.533
No! No...

01:02:17.248 --> 01:02:19.651
Not so easy to get
inside you, is it?

01:02:21.553 --> 01:02:23.088
My body obeys me.

01:02:25.924 --> 01:02:27.792
Okay, that's good.

01:02:34.733 --> 01:02:36.568
I'll never have kids.

01:02:38.336 --> 01:02:39.804
I'm sure of it.

01:02:43.608 --> 01:02:45.176
Okay, breathe.

01:03:09.334 --> 01:03:11.469
Did you really kill
your own kids?

01:03:26.618 --> 01:03:28.019
You suffocated them?

01:03:40.165 --> 01:03:41.733
In their little beds,

01:03:46.471 --> 01:03:47.906
with their little pillows?

01:04:00.218 --> 01:04:01.586
And your husband?

01:04:09.359 --> 01:04:10.562
With a knife.

01:04:16.167 --> 01:04:17.735
I would've killed myself.

01:04:21.239 --> 01:04:22.674
I tried.

01:04:28.947 --> 01:04:30.949
Explains
your plastic pussy.

01:04:53.872 --> 01:04:55.071
<i>Dibs increased the dose</i>

01:04:55.073 --> 01:04:57.773
<i>when she wanted us
at her mercy.</i>

01:04:57.775 --> 01:05:00.078
<i>We'd all hit the wall
and dropped like flies,</i>

01:05:01.445 --> 01:05:03.147
<i>sleep for hours.</i>

01:06:35.906 --> 01:06:37.175
Sleep.

01:06:39.143 --> 01:06:40.477
I'm the pilot.

01:06:41.678 --> 01:06:43.348
You cannot make me sleep.

01:06:47.185 --> 01:06:48.353
Sleep.

01:07:12.443 --> 01:07:14.878
You smell so good.

01:07:16.414 --> 01:07:17.614
Monte.

01:07:26.257 --> 01:07:30.261
Maybe it's because you never
wanted anything from me.

01:07:34.232 --> 01:07:35.966
I'm allowed to have you now.

01:07:55.152 --> 01:07:58.423
Why don't you ever take me
in your arms?

01:07:58.822 --> 01:07:59.823
Hmm?

01:08:08.098 --> 01:08:12.403
If I close my eyes,
I know I'm gonna feel you inside.

01:08:13.438 --> 01:08:14.638
I know.

01:08:15.639 --> 01:08:17.607
I almost can feel it.

01:08:28.785 --> 01:08:30.187
Yes.

01:08:32.756 --> 01:08:34.325
Fill me.

01:08:35.526 --> 01:08:37.428
Fill me, Monte.

01:09:10.993 --> 01:09:12.328
Thank you.

01:09:12.796 --> 01:09:14.331
Thank you.

01:09:15.698 --> 01:09:18.335
Thank you.

01:10:46.423 --> 01:10:47.824
There.

01:10:48.658 --> 01:10:50.093
Yes.

01:10:56.399 --> 01:10:59.069
Crawl inside, my baby.

01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:01.938
Crawl inside.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.442
Crawl inside.

01:11:09.179 --> 01:11:10.678
Crawl, crawl,

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.447
<i>crawl.</i>

01:11:12.449 --> 01:11:13.950
<i>Yes.</i>

01:11:15.185 --> 01:11:17.153
<i>Yes.</i>

01:11:18.154 --> 01:11:20.190
<i>Yes.</i>

01:11:23.093 --> 01:11:25.095
<i>My baby.</i>

01:12:42.905 --> 01:12:44.107
They got me.

01:12:46.909 --> 01:12:49.512
They got me.

01:12:56.586 --> 01:12:57.886
Hey.

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:06.363
Yes.

01:13:07.731 --> 01:13:09.299
My good baby.

01:13:11.234 --> 01:13:12.602
Yes.

01:13:42.265 --> 01:13:43.500
Come on.

01:13:44.066 --> 01:13:45.635
Hey.

01:13:47.136 --> 01:13:48.902
Go on, get out.

01:13:48.904 --> 01:13:52.807
- I hate that bed.
- Go on. Hey.

01:13:52.809 --> 01:13:55.745
Go back to your own bunk.
Come on.

01:13:58.247 --> 01:13:59.816
Come on! You're too heavy now.

01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:02.084
Come on.

01:14:04.821 --> 01:14:06.188
Crazy girl.

01:14:09.024 --> 01:14:10.660
It's too far.

01:14:33.048 --> 01:14:36.185
Bums and losers,
that's what you are.

01:14:38.455 --> 01:14:40.222
I found all your records.

01:14:42.057 --> 01:14:43.893
You killed your friend
over a dog.

01:14:47.864 --> 01:14:49.131
Yeah.

01:14:55.304 --> 01:14:56.673
I'm crazy, girl.

01:15:33.542 --> 01:15:35.912
Do I detect a farewell
in your eyes?

01:15:37.246 --> 01:15:38.882
You're a skilled pilot.

01:15:40.249 --> 01:15:41.885
None of the rest of us
could do this.

01:15:44.621 --> 01:15:46.221
You made your choice.

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.729
Why are you crying?

01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.268
I'm moved.

01:16:10.546 --> 01:16:12.214
I have to stay alone now.

01:16:29.231 --> 01:16:30.499
Where are you going?

01:16:31.099 --> 01:16:32.334
To the garden.

01:17:50.412 --> 01:17:52.079
<i>That's not Nansen.</i>

01:17:52.081 --> 01:17:53.315
<i>That's not Nansen.</i>

01:17:55.917 --> 01:17:57.086
It's Boyse.

01:18:31.553 --> 01:18:33.355
Fuck!

01:20:43.218 --> 01:20:44.986
<i>That child is your daughter,</i>

01:20:47.421 --> 01:20:48.924
<i>born of your genes.</i>

01:20:51.893 --> 01:20:53.595
<i>She's strong-made.</i>

01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:56.832
<i>Like her big-booty mother.</i>

01:21:01.002 --> 01:21:03.104
<i>For me, she's perfection.</i>

01:24:30.878 --> 01:24:33.078
<i>"I'd rather
sink into the Earth</i>

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.948
"after I've lost you
than to sit around and grieve

01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:38.952
"once you've gone off
into your destiny."

01:24:40.888 --> 01:24:42.122
What are you talkin' about?

01:24:44.392 --> 01:24:46.591
It's what my wife told me.

01:24:46.593 --> 01:24:50.263
I told her I was doing
all this for her and our son,

01:24:50.265 --> 01:24:54.434
to turn our shame into
some type of glory, you know?

01:24:54.436 --> 01:24:58.103
She says that this mission
was like burying her twice

01:24:58.105 --> 01:25:00.808
and that my idea of glory
was bullshit.

01:30:10.116 --> 01:30:11.585
There's no response.

01:30:14.821 --> 01:30:16.256
Looks like ours.

01:30:17.758 --> 01:30:19.459
It's the same.

01:30:21.428 --> 01:30:22.962
It's the same ship.

01:30:25.399 --> 01:30:26.733
There might be, uh,

01:30:29.770 --> 01:30:33.239
other people, um,

01:30:35.007 --> 01:30:36.476
on board.

01:30:37.477 --> 01:30:38.745
So?

01:30:51.924 --> 01:30:52.958
What?

01:30:58.130 --> 01:31:00.966
They might be able
to help us.

01:31:08.307 --> 01:31:09.609
We don't need help.

01:31:27.894 --> 01:31:28.895
Are you scared?

01:31:29.696 --> 01:31:31.397
- No.
- No?

01:31:32.398 --> 01:31:33.533
No.

01:31:35.968 --> 01:31:37.169
Are you sure?

01:32:48.274 --> 01:32:50.276
Are those dogs?

01:32:53.612 --> 01:32:54.814
Yeah.

01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:30.076
Do you have the baby dog?

01:34:31.844 --> 01:34:33.079
I had to leave it.

01:34:33.879 --> 01:34:34.981
Why didn't you take it?

01:34:35.748 --> 01:34:37.481
We could've kept it.

01:34:37.483 --> 01:34:38.484
We couldn't have kept it.

01:34:39.485 --> 01:34:41.054
I wanted a dog so bad.

01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:43.856
A little dog to hold.

01:34:47.159 --> 01:34:49.192
You know why.

01:34:49.194 --> 01:34:51.161
Just step away from the door,
it wasn't clean in there.

01:34:51.163 --> 01:34:53.163
I gotta disinfect,
I gotta clean myself.

01:34:53.165 --> 01:34:55.434
It'll die in there.
It's cruelty!

01:34:59.405 --> 01:35:00.706
What do you know
about cruelty?

01:35:03.842 --> 01:35:05.010
You don't know anything
about it.

01:35:07.046 --> 01:35:08.914
<i>I need to clean,
I need to disinfect myself.</i>

01:35:09.748 --> 01:35:11.581
<i>Move away from the door!</i>

01:35:11.583 --> 01:35:12.918
Move away from the door!

01:35:15.421 --> 01:35:16.588
Get out.

01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:19.649
You were right, Dad.

01:36:19.651 --> 01:36:20.686
You were right.

01:36:22.286 --> 01:36:23.522
I'm sorry.

01:36:25.924 --> 01:36:27.459
I have everything I need here.

01:36:30.162 --> 01:36:31.663
Just go up, peanut.

01:36:52.785 --> 01:36:53.786
What're you doin'?

01:36:56.054 --> 01:36:57.055
Praying.

01:37:01.727 --> 01:37:03.462
You know a god to pray to?

01:37:04.963 --> 01:37:06.165
What god are you praying to?

01:37:09.701 --> 01:37:12.070
I saw it in some
of the random images from Earth.

01:37:13.639 --> 01:37:16.508
I just wanted to know
what they feel.

01:37:30.689 --> 01:37:32.423
Time to feed the dog.

01:37:35.561 --> 01:37:37.029
ID 149.

01:37:39.164 --> 01:37:42.534
Local day 6750.

01:37:44.036 --> 01:37:48.841
Earth days 76861.

01:38:07.525 --> 01:38:09.761
Looks like
a crocodile's eye.

01:38:11.630 --> 01:38:14.032
More like a mouth
that wants to swallow us up.

01:38:18.904 --> 01:38:20.371
It's so big.

01:38:21.472 --> 01:38:22.808
We should try it.

01:38:23.641 --> 01:38:24.910
I can feel it.

01:38:27.312 --> 01:38:29.913
Oh, you can feel it?

01:38:29.915 --> 01:38:32.483
I thought we were
supposed to be drifters.

01:38:33.285 --> 01:38:34.786
But it's so big.

01:38:36.554 --> 01:38:38.456
I'm sure the density
is very low.

01:38:45.297 --> 01:38:46.965
I believe in this one.

01:38:52.637 --> 01:38:54.773
I'm sad that you deleted
all your data.

01:38:55.974 --> 01:38:58.108
Even your prison records.

01:38:58.110 --> 01:39:00.576
You might've been
thugs and criminals,

01:39:00.578 --> 01:39:03.179
but you're heroes to me.

01:39:03.181 --> 01:39:04.647
It'll all be destroyed
by the firewall

01:39:04.649 --> 01:39:07.350
once the ship gets sucked
into the black hole anyway.

01:39:07.352 --> 01:39:09.288
There is no firewall.
I know it.

01:39:10.188 --> 01:39:11.622
We'll make it through.

01:39:16.995 --> 01:39:18.696
You always
avoid my questions.

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.202
Do I look like my mother?

01:39:29.507 --> 01:39:30.641
No.

01:39:32.777 --> 01:39:33.946
Take a good look.

01:39:35.646 --> 01:39:36.882
My eyes?

01:39:39.017 --> 01:39:40.152
No.

01:39:41.619 --> 01:39:43.021
My hair?

01:39:45.723 --> 01:39:47.192
No, not at all.

01:39:48.859 --> 01:39:51.330
My nose? My mouth?

01:39:54.199 --> 01:39:56.465
You have rodent teeth.

01:39:56.467 --> 01:39:57.668
You're a little rat.

01:39:59.204 --> 01:40:01.306
Rats are incredibly
intelligent animals.

01:40:05.143 --> 01:40:06.378
Am I weird-looking?

01:40:13.418 --> 01:40:14.819
You're special.

01:40:17.588 --> 01:40:18.990
So different.

01:40:23.161 --> 01:40:24.895
You're like no one else.

01:40:27.531 --> 01:40:28.733
And I love that.

01:43:54.038 --> 01:43:55.206
Shall we?

01:43:57.474 --> 01:43:58.642
Yes.
