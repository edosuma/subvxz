WEBVTT

01:27.336 --> 01:28.546
Oh, dear.

01:28.671 --> 01:30.381
Such table manners.

01:35.094 --> 01:37.305
Perhaps I can make you act
a bit more civilized.

01:53.904 --> 01:56.032
Bravo!

01:56.449 --> 01:59.076
They all laughed when I said I'd find
a way to tap into another

01:59.160 --> 02:00.453
creature's mind.

02:00.745 --> 02:03.414
Why, with this band and these
electrodes,

02:03.623 --> 02:05.499
I can control anything.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.171
Psst, Jervis.

02:10.379 --> 02:14.884
Oh, Alice.
What a nice surprise.

02:16.052 --> 02:18.679
Yeah, yeah. Look busy.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.515
<i>Dr. Gates, Mr. Wayne.</i>

02:24.977 --> 02:26.854
Right this way.

02:33.277 --> 02:36.572
Bruce, you remember Jervis Tetch.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.409
- Hello.
- Of course.

02:40.910 --> 02:44.830
I read your proposal on using microchips
to enhance the brain's potential.

02:44.997 --> 02:46.207
Sounds intriguing.

02:46.374 --> 02:50.544
Actually, the prototype
isn't quite ready yet.

02:50.753 --> 02:54.924
Tetch, I think we owe our founder
and employer, Mr. Wayne,

02:55.091 --> 02:57.968
a little more than lame excuses.

02:58.719 --> 03:01.305
- Sorry.
- That's all right, Dr. Cates.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.557
Mr. Tetch is a valued member
of our research team.

03:03.766 --> 03:05.685
I'm sure we can spare him more time.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.603
As you say, Bruce.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.564
Thank you.

03:20.199 --> 03:22.243
You got off easy this time, Tetch,

03:22.326 --> 03:25.538
but heads could roll
if you slip up again.

03:36.298 --> 03:39.218
She's always like that
when the big boss drops by.

03:39.385 --> 03:42.221
Cheer up. Mr. Wayne knows
what you mean to the company.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.389
Oh.

03:43.723 --> 03:48.102
Sometimes, Alice, I think you're
the only one who understands me.

03:48.352 --> 03:51.647
That's just
what my boyfriend says.

03:55.943 --> 03:59.572
I guess I'm lucky to have two
such amazing men in my life.

03:59.905 --> 04:01.449
See you after lunch.

04:09.540 --> 04:13.085
Of course, intellectually,
I know it's all wrong.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.546
She's got a boyfriend, after all.

04:16.297 --> 04:19.008
Better to withdraw like a gentleman.
Forget her.

04:19.258 --> 04:21.260
Turn my heart to other pursuits.

04:26.056 --> 04:27.558
Never!

04:30.311 --> 04:32.730
Look. I've already developed
a circuitry card

04:32.897 --> 04:35.316
powerful enough
to control a human brain.

04:35.691 --> 04:40.654
It would be so easy to make her forget
her boorish beau and love me.

04:40.905 --> 04:41.906
Ah.

04:42.448 --> 04:45.534
But that would reduce her
to a soulless shell.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.579
Oh, no, not my Alice.

04:48.704 --> 04:49.705
Oh.

04:50.247 --> 04:52.291
It's hopeless.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.878
DR. - Oh, Alice, I'm sorry.

05:03.594 --> 05:06.347
Curiouser and curiouser.

05:09.433 --> 05:12.478
I just wanted to talk about
where our relationship was going

05:12.645 --> 05:14.730
and Billy got so defensive.

05:15.189 --> 05:19.318
Mmm. Classic male fear of commitment.

05:19.819 --> 05:23.364
The next thing I knew,
we were shouting, screaming.

05:23.614 --> 05:27.034
Saying we never wanted
to see each other again.

05:30.496 --> 05:34.041
0 frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!

05:34.124 --> 05:35.835
She's mine for the asking.

05:36.043 --> 05:40.673
I'II sweep her off her feet, treat her
to a wonderful night on the town and...

05:42.633 --> 05:43.884
Nothing.

05:44.218 --> 05:47.304
What could a beautiful girl like her
ever see in someone like me?

05:47.555 --> 05:49.932
How could I impress her?

05:51.725 --> 05:52.726
Hmm.

05:54.728 --> 05:56.522
How, indeed.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.156
Jervis?

06:11.161 --> 06:12.580
Good evening, Miss Pleasance.

06:13.205 --> 06:15.958
I'm here to help you forget
your recent heartbreak.

06:16.208 --> 06:19.169
Gotham can be a wonderland, Alice.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.172
Tonight, let me be your guide.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.050
I'll get my coat.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.808
Did you see that?

06:32.975 --> 06:36.896
- Gotta be the Bat-Creep.
- Hey, easy money headed our way.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.906
This is really a surprise, Jervis.
You're so...

06:47.072 --> 06:48.574
Quiet at work.

06:48.824 --> 06:51.327
Ah, still waters run deep, my dear.

06:51.577 --> 06:55.664
It's been my philosophy that people
should take what they want from life.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.708
Hey, ours too.

06:58.042 --> 07:00.920
Okay, Mr. Hat, let's have the money.

07:01.211 --> 07:03.839
On your way, curs,
lest I'm forced to teach you a lesson.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.132
Jervis, no.

07:05.674 --> 07:07.635
It's your funeral, nut boy.

07:15.643 --> 07:18.187
Please, Mr. Hat, go easy on us.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.814
We're sorry. Honest.

07:22.524 --> 07:27.112
Why don't you do something useful,
like, oh, go jump in the river.

07:27.363 --> 07:28.906
Okay.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.452
- Are you all right?
- I'm sorry you had to see that.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.496
But they had to be taught a lesson.

07:41.043 --> 07:44.421
<i>Dare we hope Gotham treats you
to an early evening, sir?</i>

07:45.756 --> 07:49.218
I should be so lucky. The police
emergency band just switched on.

07:49.760 --> 07:54.974
<i>Then I'll prepare your usual breakfast,
toast, coffee, bandages.</i>

07:55.641 --> 07:56.934
Good night, Alfred.

07:57.267 --> 07:58.644
All <i>units.</i> All <i>units.</i>

07:58.727 --> 08:02.106
<i>Two possible suicides reported scaling
the Gotham Bridge suspension tower.</i>

08:02.314 --> 08:04.817
<i>- All units, please respond.</i>
- Guess <i>I'm</i> elected.

08:26.672 --> 08:27.673
Engage.

08:35.222 --> 08:36.682
Lousy night for a swim.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.934
Mr. Hat told us to jump in the river.

08:40.102 --> 08:44.023
Right. Look, you guys stay calm and-

08:44.273 --> 08:46.233
Gotta do what Mr. Hat says.

08:52.322 --> 08:53.699
Stop!

09:21.810 --> 09:24.772
Hey, man, keep away from me.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.732
We never touched the creep.

09:27.691 --> 09:30.986
Okay, maybe we hit him up
for money, but we never-

09:31.278 --> 09:33.655
Hey, what are we doing here?

09:40.788 --> 09:45.209
Monsieur Tetch, I have created
a gastronomical delight for you.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.586
All on the house, of course.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.129
Thank you, Antoine.

09:49.296 --> 09:50.798
Pardon, Monsieur Tetch.

09:50.964 --> 09:54.551
Would you be so kind as to favor us
with a photo for our celebrity wall?

09:54.927 --> 09:56.762
Enchanté, my dear.

10:00.349 --> 10:03.393
I had no idea you were
such a man about town.

10:04.186 --> 10:08.107
Ah, this is a side I share only
with those closest to me.

10:22.704 --> 10:25.040
Don't forget to lock up
when you're done, Mr. Tetch.

10:25.165 --> 10:26.375
Right-o.

10:32.881 --> 10:37.678
You know, <i>Alice</i> in <i>Wonderland</i>
was always my favorite story.

10:38.178 --> 10:41.223
Do you remember
"The Mock Turtle's Song"?

10:42.057 --> 10:44.059
<i>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you</i>

10:44.768 --> 10:46.395
Won't you join the dance?

11:03.328 --> 11:07.833
When you showed me that strange card,
I recalled an image from my childhood.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.419
It seems those near-suicides

11:10.502 --> 11:13.505
had a run-in
with a self-styled Mad Hatter.

11:14.089 --> 11:16.466
I saw that picture earlier today

11:17.050 --> 11:21.471
in the office of a scientist
who creates circuitry similar to this.

11:28.145 --> 11:32.566
Thank you for a wonderful time.
You're a terrific friend.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.694
Until tomorrow, dear Alice.

11:38.405 --> 11:42.367
Tomorrow and every day afterward.

11:48.707 --> 11:51.293
What a sweet, funny man.

11:55.672 --> 11:57.466
- Alice?
- Billy?

11:59.343 --> 12:01.929
Baby, I'm sorry. Can we talk?

12:09.645 --> 12:11.146
<i>Will you, won't you, will you...</i>

12:12.189 --> 12:17.486
Ah, good morning. Hello!
Good to see you. Lovely day, what?

12:27.496 --> 12:31.208
Oh, Jervis, thanks so much
for cheering me up last night.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.169
Listen, I have the most incredible news.

12:34.461 --> 12:36.213
Billy was there
after you dropped me off.

12:36.421 --> 12:38.548
He apologized. I forgave him.

12:38.715 --> 12:41.051
And then, he gave me this.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.136
Can you believe it?

12:44.596 --> 12:46.265
I'm getting married.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.520
Jervis, your hand.

12:51.687 --> 12:54.982
Oh, it's nothing. Forget it.

12:55.691 --> 12:58.277
- And congratulations.
- Jervis?

12:58.402 --> 12:59.528
Jervis?

13:05.242 --> 13:08.954
I can still fix this. I can still win!

13:09.329 --> 13:10.831
DR. - Tetch!

13:11.415 --> 13:13.083
I don't know what you did,

13:13.166 --> 13:15.961
but Bruce Wayne
is demanding to see you now!

13:17.170 --> 13:19.298
I promise you, Tetch, it's your head

13:19.381 --> 13:21.925
if you've gotten
my department in any trouble.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.761
<i>Oh, do be quiet, Dr. Gates!</i>

13:32.644 --> 13:35.939
Excuse me, Alice.
Have you seen Marcia or Jervis Tetch?

13:36.398 --> 13:38.483
They left together
about half an hour ago.

13:38.984 --> 13:39.985
Together?

13:42.779 --> 13:44.990
Hello? Hi, sweetie.

13:45.240 --> 13:48.285
- My fiancé.
- Congratulations.

13:51.830 --> 13:55.125
Billy, what's wrong?
You sound so- What?

13:56.084 --> 14:00.464
But why? Billy? Billy.

14:01.965 --> 14:07.054
Excuse me, Mr. Wayne.
I think I'm gonna need a minute alone.

14:11.850 --> 14:16.021
Sorry, Billy, me lad,
but all's fair in love and war.

14:37.542 --> 14:38.585
Alice, darling.

14:39.795 --> 14:43.340
I had to come back when I heard
that cad abandoned you again.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.968
How did you know? I didn't tell anyone.

14:47.260 --> 14:48.720
Oh, pish tosh.

14:48.804 --> 14:52.974
What matters now is we have each other,
now and forever.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.559
Oh...

14:54.643 --> 14:56.853
This is getting too weird.

14:57.270 --> 15:00.357
What have you done with
Marcia Gates and this girl's fiancé?

15:00.732 --> 15:02.943
No, I don't like this game.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.361
Let's play another.

15:14.287 --> 15:18.834
I anticipated there'd be trouble sooner
or later, so I enlisted some help.

15:19.084 --> 15:24.089
I'm sure you recognize my friends,
the Walrus and the Carpenter.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.108
Why are you doing this?

15:43.775 --> 15:45.819
For us, my dearest.

15:45.902 --> 15:49.823
Oh, believe me.
I didn't want it this way.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.101
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat.

17:00.685 --> 17:03.063
How I wonder what you're at.

17:15.116 --> 17:18.370
Now, this is a game more to my liking.

17:18.954 --> 17:22.666
Are you, the famous Batman,
so intent upon destroying my happiness

17:22.749 --> 17:27.045
that you'll harm these poor,
mind-warped innocents to get me?

17:27.420 --> 17:29.381
Let's find out.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.472
Off with his head.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.860
Oh, one thing I forgot to mention.

17:51.027 --> 17:54.281
My control over my pawns
increases their strength.

17:54.864 --> 17:56.616
Guess you found that out, huh?

18:03.915 --> 18:05.625
Oh!

18:07.711 --> 18:09.379
Off with his head!

18:34.487 --> 18:35.905
Batman.

18:36.364 --> 18:39.868
There's the knave. Off with his head!

18:40.410 --> 18:42.120
They're programmed to attack me.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.706
- But they won't fight you.
- I gotcha.

18:49.669 --> 18:50.879
My aching skull.

18:51.546 --> 18:53.673
Come, my dear. It's time we were away.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.747
You're mighty
in Gotham, Batman,

19:25.830 --> 19:29.459
but in Wonderland,
the Mad Hatter reigns supreme.

20:06.204 --> 20:09.916
I'II cut that cowl off your neck
before you'll take her.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.794
I've waited my whole
lonely life for her!

20:13.545 --> 20:15.672
Then all you've waited for is a puppet.

20:17.298 --> 20:19.384
A soulless little doll.

20:19.926 --> 20:23.888
It didn't have to be this way.
You made me do this to her!

20:51.541 --> 20:53.251
Grrr!

21:21.029 --> 21:23.615
- Alice?
- Oh, Billy!

21:36.085 --> 21:38.797
Would not, could not...

21:39.881 --> 21:41.716
Would not, could not.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.303
Oh, could not join the dance.
