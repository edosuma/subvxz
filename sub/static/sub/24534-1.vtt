WEBVTT

00:40.290 --> 00:42.906
Someone there?

00:45.330 --> 00:49.209
I mean, not one of the passed?

00:57.300 --> 01:00.178
I haven't used my voice in a while.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.091
Am I talking loud?

01:05.270 --> 01:06.146
Iam.

01:13.030 --> 01:16.568
Maybe, sir or madam, you are not there,

01:16.660 --> 01:20.619
but it is something
to hear your voice after a bit.

01:20.790 --> 01:23.190
Just saying words.

01:24.790 --> 01:26.917
Platypus.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.536
Pasta.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.297
Potable.

01:32.380 --> 01:33.256
Hmm.

01:35.930 --> 01:39.002
If you are there, you can come out.
We can sit.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.967
Split a can of Pecos Strawberries.

01:43.180 --> 01:48.766
"Have a little badinage,"
my mama used to say.

01:48.850 --> 01:54.026
That's just a fancy word for "chat".
It's been...

01:56.950 --> 02:00.317
I don't know. Maybe a year?

02:04.660 --> 02:08.073
I had a place where I was before.

02:08.170 --> 02:11.742
I had a good metric ton of popcorn.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.912
I still got a lot.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.126
I can make some.

02:21.010 --> 02:24.673
I just read books. I...

02:24.770 --> 02:26.419
I watched movies, mostly.

02:26.520 --> 02:30.012
ButI read, I read books, now.

02:30.150 --> 02:35.429
I got a few with me,
if you have a need for reading material.

02:40.570 --> 02:44.859
Well, since there is no one there,

02:47.960 --> 02:53.535
before I go quiet again
for maybe another year,

02:53.630 --> 02:59.375
I might as well tell you
that I did talk to someone.

02:59.470 --> 03:03.042
She wasn't just someone.

03:03.140 --> 03:07.099
She came to my door. Just showed up.

03:08.520 --> 03:12.763
I let her stay. And, we fell...

03:16.400 --> 03:20.439
We had feelings for each other.

03:20.530 --> 03:25.274
One day, we allowed it. One day.

03:29.750 --> 03:33.038
I just thought I'd say that.

03:35.380 --> 03:40.966
Because I supposed
I would see it when I said it.

03:41.050 --> 03:46.090
And I did.
And that was nice.

03:47.510 --> 03:51.799
There ain't been a lot of nice.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.533
So, what's your story?

04:50.490 --> 04:55.280
If you're gonna hit me
with your stick, don't open the door!

04:56.210 --> 04:59.702
Well, you know, if you're gonna try.

05:04.550 --> 05:09.419
Looks like you've settled in out here.

05:15.100 --> 05:19.184
I thought maybe,
we could continue our acquaintance.

05:22.860 --> 05:27.445
"Here" and "there" are just labels.
It's all one place.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.577
You could do all this somewhere else.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.204
Or, well,

05:36.330 --> 05:39.128
in the same place,

05:39.210 --> 05:41.917
somewhere else.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.466
Come on.

05:47.550 --> 05:52.055
The reason we fought is
because you wanted to protect people.

05:52.140 --> 05:55.803
You care about people.

05:55.930 --> 06:00.765
You should be with them.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.907
It's me.

06:21.500 --> 06:25.379
Come back to The Kingdom.

06:25.460 --> 06:29.123
You helped me. You did. Let me help you.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.803
I don't want to tell you what to do.

06:37.940 --> 06:42.229
But you know who I am,

06:42.310 --> 06:45.029
and I know who you are.

06:49.070 --> 06:52.733
You belong with people who care about you.

07:06.260 --> 07:09.252
Come on, Morgan!

07:09.380 --> 07:14.135
You can hide, but you can't run.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.263
Look, I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

07:22.350 --> 07:26.138
I wouldn't.

07:26.230 --> 07:29.779
I was hurt.

07:29.860 --> 07:33.318
You brought me in.

07:33.410 --> 07:36.117
You didn't have to.

07:38.700 --> 07:43.455
Morgan, you don't have
a gunshot in your side,

07:45.340 --> 07:48.332
but you are hurt.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.547
Come back with me.

07:53.180 --> 07:57.844
Don't wait this time.
Don't waste one more second.

07:57.930 --> 08:03.220
You're alive. You're part of the world.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.067
Look, I'm here, now.

08:08.150 --> 08:14.271
A lot of people are here now
because you helped me

08:16.240 --> 08:20.688
right at the beginning.

08:26.500 --> 08:30.504
That's not me any more, Rick.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.171
It is.

08:40.720 --> 08:45.259
You'll end up with people
one way or another.

08:45.350 --> 08:50.060
You're connected.
It'll be a shout from outside that door.

08:51.780 --> 08:54.692
Me asking for help,

08:54.780 --> 08:57.487
Maggie...

08:57.570 --> 09:00.789
You're a part of the world already.

09:00.870 --> 09:02.576
You'll find your way back to it,

09:02.750 --> 09:07.699
because it'll find its way back to you,
so, just...

09:07.790 --> 09:09.838
Come back.

09:20.220 --> 09:23.599
Like I said, you can hide,

09:25.480 --> 09:27.186
but you can't run.

10:48.140 --> 10:51.473
Thanks for letting me in.
You don ’t have to be out here.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.972
Look, I came for you before.

10:54.190 --> 10:58.024
Don ’t wait this time.
Don ’t waste one more second.

10:58.150 --> 10:59.856
You ’re alive.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.360
Thanks for letting me in.

11:01.450 --> 11:04.237
You can hide, but you can ’t run.

11:20.050 --> 11:22.712
You know what it is.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.961
You know what it is.

15:18.830 --> 15:23.278
Take that shit home.

15:23.380 --> 15:27.589
- Take it back!
- I'm just trying to help.

15:27.710 --> 15:30.429
It looked like you were on your own.

15:32.300 --> 15:36.634
We're always on our own.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.017
Shut the door.

16:26.770 --> 16:28.397
...I just thought I'd say that.

16:35.070 --> 16:40.110
Because I supposed
I would see it when I said it.

16:40.540 --> 16:43.452
And I did.

16:57.010 --> 16:58.216
So, what's your story?

17:01.140 --> 17:02.550
I'm just passing through.

17:03.060 --> 17:06.644
Well, why don't you come on,
and sit a spell?

17:06.730 --> 17:09.187
I don't know how much you heard, but I...

17:09.270 --> 17:12.023
It's been a while
since I talked to someone.

17:14.820 --> 17:15.809
I'm John.

17:17.530 --> 17:21.239
John Dorie, like the fish,
but 'I-E', no 'Y'.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.074
Morgan.

17:25.540 --> 17:26.700
Morgan.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.456
Are you hungry, Morgan?

17:31.550 --> 17:33.916
Because I could cook you something.

17:34.050 --> 17:36.257
I got beans, and I got beans.

17:38.550 --> 17:40.211
No, thank you.

17:41.770 --> 17:42.759
Hey.

17:49.060 --> 17:52.314
- It's tasty.
- No.

17:59.740 --> 18:00.820
Where you from?

18:01.950 --> 18:04.157
Back east.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.150
- You walk?
- I ran.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.782
Hey,

18:10.880 --> 18:14.259
in your travels, did you, uh,

18:14.340 --> 18:20.006
come across a woman
carrying a pistol like this?

18:20.100 --> 18:22.500
Identical, in point of fact.

18:25.140 --> 18:29.224
I've been looking for her for some time.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.856
Not seen anybody like that.

18:41.030 --> 18:42.019
I'm gonna go.

18:42.120 --> 18:46.489
Hey... Uh, there's no sense
in setting out this time at night.

18:46.620 --> 18:49.612
Why don't you take the back of the truck?
I'll take the cab.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.584
Or vice versa.

18:54.670 --> 18:57.332
I think having a covered place
to lay your head

18:57.420 --> 19:01.538
would give you some relief,
having come as far as you have.

19:05.140 --> 19:06.710
Yeah.

20:22.550 --> 20:23.426
Oh.

20:24.970 --> 20:27.382
Whatever you're thinking, don't.

20:27.470 --> 20:32.590
This looks handy.
You some kind of karate man?

20:36.770 --> 20:40.558
I'm just passing through.

20:40.650 --> 20:42.060
Keep the food.

20:42.150 --> 20:44.198
Give me back the rest,
and I'll be on my way.

20:44.280 --> 20:47.408
Afraid you ain't exactly
in a position to bargain.

20:47.490 --> 20:50.698
We just can't have you telling folks
about our little mousetrap here.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.572
I got nobody to tell.

20:54.670 --> 20:59.369
I don't know anybody here.
Don't wanna know anybody.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.751
I got no beef with you gentlemen.

21:07.890 --> 21:11.269
I'm just looking out for my friend.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.056
We have friends, too.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.908
I'd like to take this opportunity
to apologise for shooting your gun.

21:38.540 --> 21:44.001
Karate man, and a gunslinger.
How about that?

21:47.800 --> 21:49.176
Now, that's an antique.

21:49.260 --> 21:52.309
Only one other one like it.
So, I'd appreciate it if you'd--

22:12.830 --> 22:14.536
Thought you didn't drive at night, Al.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.992
Was parked nearby. Heard a shot.

22:18.080 --> 22:22.585
Wanted to see what was what.
So, what's what?

22:23.670 --> 22:28.039
He said he was on his own.
His friend damn near shot my hand off.

22:28.130 --> 22:31.964
New people. I like new people.

22:33.140 --> 22:35.882
Just keep driving, Al. We're good here.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.471
You don't look good. You look hungry.

22:39.230 --> 22:43.189
I got a case...
Cup o'noodles in the back.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.851
Korean brand.

22:45.940 --> 22:49.694
It's got that kimchi powder
you mix up on top.

22:49.780 --> 22:50.769
Not enough, Al.

22:51.030 --> 22:56.696
I'll throw in a case of Pall Malls.
I know how you love your Pall Malls.

22:56.790 --> 22:59.497
You got your hand on the lever?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.286
Why in the hell you acting
like we have a choice?

23:03.500 --> 23:06.003
There's always a choice, Leland.

23:12.220 --> 23:14.131
This just happens to be an easy one.

23:28.150 --> 23:32.063
Hey, thanks for giving us
a hand back there.

23:32.160 --> 23:35.948
- "Al", is it?
- Althea, actually.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.361
There's a candy for you.

23:40.080 --> 23:43.129
Thank you.

23:43.330 --> 23:46.493
Leland and his boys
have gotten pretty desperate.

23:46.590 --> 23:49.548
Seems like every store, kitchen,
and pantry from here to Tyler

23:49.630 --> 23:52.428
is picked over down to the studs.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.348
I'm guessing from your vehicle,

23:57.430 --> 24:00.729
that you are,
or were an officer of the law?

24:00.810 --> 24:02.596
Not exactly.

24:04.770 --> 24:06.761
I'd like to get out of here, please.

24:09.610 --> 24:12.317
Aanhere along here is fine.

24:12.950 --> 24:16.659
Sorry, guys. Didn't rescue you
out of the goodness of my heart.

24:16.740 --> 24:18.071
You guys owe me.

24:53.070 --> 24:55.982
Uh, I don't mean to be ungrateful, ma'am,

24:56.070 --> 24:59.824
but my truck's parked
in that town back there.

25:06.170 --> 25:08.832
All right. Who wants to go first?

25:10.130 --> 25:11.290
Ho!

25:14.720 --> 25:17.041
- You're quick.
-Iam.

25:17.930 --> 25:20.637
Well, easy there, cowboy.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.883
I didn't save you, so I could kill you.

25:25.310 --> 25:27.266
I just want to ask you a few questions.

25:27.440 --> 25:30.432
- Questions?
- Yeah.

25:30.530 --> 25:33.067
What you've seen. Who you've met.

25:33.150 --> 25:36.278
- Where you've been. Where you're going.
- Why?

25:36.490 --> 25:39.368
It's for a story.

25:41.450 --> 25:42.997
I'm a journalist.

25:48.920 --> 25:52.253
- You were alone at the cabin.
- Yeah.

25:52.340 --> 25:54.911
- Before Lauren showed up?
- Laura.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.087
- Right. Sorry.
- Nope. Nobody.

25:58.840 --> 26:02.059
I talked to myself a /0(;
but I had to quit.

26:02.140 --> 26:04.051
Why?

26:04.140 --> 26:07.348
I started enjoying
that conversation too much.

26:10.150 --> 26:14.849
What else can you tell me about Laura?
In case we ever cross paths?

26:14.940 --> 26:15.986
Mmm...

26:17.950 --> 26:20.862
- She enjoyed a Blackjack.
- A card player?

26:20.950 --> 26:22.941
Taffy. Licorice.

26:23.700 --> 26:27.204
- I never much cared for them before.
- And, now?

26:32.000 --> 26:34.457
I don't mind them.

26:36.920 --> 26:40.469
- You think you'll find her?
- I know I will.

26:42.010 --> 26:43.466
How exactly did you get split up?

26:47.440 --> 26:49.226
I'm afraid that's not a very happy story.

26:49.940 --> 26:52.761
- Most aren't, nowadays.
- Ours will be.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.108
This one will be,
once we find our way back to each other.

27:02.410 --> 27:05.038
Is that...

27:07.620 --> 27:11.624
- Great. Thank you.
- Sure.

27:16.090 --> 27:17.876
How about you?

27:18.220 --> 27:20.256
- How long you been on the road?
- What does it matter?

27:20.340 --> 27:23.969
These questions.
There ’5 no news stations left.

27:27.430 --> 27:31.935
I saved you. Noodles and effort.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.351
You owe me.

27:44.660 --> 27:46.400
No.

27:46.490 --> 27:50.779
I don't need that. I need your story.

28:00.930 --> 28:05.253
What brought you out here?
You going somewhere?

28:08.850 --> 28:14.265
- Getting away from--
- I a’io’n ’t ask you to save me.

28:17.730 --> 28:20.699
I'm gonna go. Or, are you saying I can't?

28:25.830 --> 28:29.903
Hold up. Hold up, friend.

28:30.120 --> 28:31.826
Hey, you've been held at gunpoint
with somebody,

28:31.910 --> 28:33.411
I think you earned the right
to call him friend.

28:33.500 --> 28:36.492
I don't want to answer any more questions.
I just want to be left be.

28:36.590 --> 28:40.003
Well, I just want
to give you something. Okay?

28:40.590 --> 28:44.378
Clean socks. Worth their weight in gold.

28:45.260 --> 28:47.216
'Course gold ain't worth much, nowadays.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.802
I seen the pair you was wearing
around the campfire.

28:51.890 --> 28:54.893
I think it's time for an upgrade.

28:56.650 --> 28:59.357
- Thanks.
- Apologies about the corn.

28:59.440 --> 29:03.024
Especially since they're for your feet.

29:03.110 --> 29:05.066
You sure you're gonna be all right
out there on your own?

29:05.570 --> 29:08.949
This world, we're always on our own.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.241
Wait. Wait.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.297
Morning, Al.

29:32.180 --> 29:33.420
Hands.

29:34.810 --> 29:35.686
Okay.

29:44.530 --> 29:46.100
I wouldn't do that.

29:46.360 --> 29:49.523
Yeah, you're not so tough
without the lever.

30:01.050 --> 30:04.042
This doesn't have to be hard, Al.
We just want the truck.

30:04.130 --> 30:06.086
Why don't you give us the keys?

30:16.640 --> 30:18.847
Hands.

30:19.900 --> 30:21.060
Hands.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.435
Let's go.

30:29.280 --> 30:33.785
Stick. I ain't gonna ask twice, man.

31:51.860 --> 31:53.691
No!

32:04.080 --> 32:05.741
Al!

34:18.180 --> 34:21.593
- You okay?
- Go. Go!

34:21.680 --> 34:22.886
Get to the van!

34:35.820 --> 34:37.902
Keys don't work, sweetheart.

34:37.990 --> 34:40.060
Because they go to my footlocker, asshole.

34:52.420 --> 34:53.296
Morgan!

34:58.180 --> 34:59.249
Get up.

34:59.340 --> 35:01.547
- Hand over the keys.
- You don't look so hot.

35:01.640 --> 35:03.676
- The
ke
- Al! YS!

35:20.450 --> 35:21.565
Get down!

35:27.040 --> 35:29.577
John!John!

35:52.270 --> 35:53.305
Oh, my...

35:53.400 --> 35:55.857
Everybody in one piece?

35:58.530 --> 36:02.773
Boy, I tell you what.
That is some ugly mustard.

36:03.990 --> 36:07.733
Gets the job done. Thanks for the assist.

36:09.250 --> 36:14.415
That guy,
he was a unique kind of asshole.

36:14.540 --> 36:17.589
But I did not want to kill anybody today.

36:27.760 --> 36:29.728
Anybody know what that 51 means?

36:29.980 --> 36:32.938
Markers like that had been popping up
around here the last few weeks,

36:33.020 --> 36:36.683
but never anyone around
to ask but the dead.

36:36.820 --> 36:40.108
The dead? I call them "the passed".

36:41.700 --> 36:43.520
We call them "walkers" where I'm from.

36:44.570 --> 36:48.654
Look at that. A piece of personal history.

36:50.290 --> 36:52.531
You still owe me.

36:55.790 --> 36:56.779
Then pull over.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.585
Your name?

37:06.390 --> 37:09.177
Morgan Jones.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.308
Where do you come from?

37:11.390 --> 37:14.894
Atlanta, ano; um,

37:14.980 --> 37:16.936
then Virginia.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.779
How'd you get here?

37:19.860 --> 37:21.737
Iran.

37:23.950 --> 37:27.022
Then I walked. Drove.

37:27.620 --> 37:30.737
Walked again.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.110
Were you part of a settlement in Virginia?

37:35.210 --> 37:38.532
A couple.

37:38.630 --> 37:41.292
Can you tell me about them?

37:45.090 --> 37:47.718
One of them was called Alexandria,

37:47.800 --> 37:52.920
and then there was
a place called The Kingdom.

37:53.020 --> 37:57.389
- Actually had a, had a king.
- A king?

37:57.480 --> 37:58.765
Even had a pet tiger.

38:01.150 --> 38:03.732
All right, we're gonna have
to sidebar that one.

38:03.820 --> 38:07.699
These settlements,
were they good places to live?

38:07.820 --> 38:09.697
They were safe places.

38:09.830 --> 38:16.247
Good people inside. I had been
with some of them for a wh/le. I...

38:16.330 --> 38:18.286
What happened?

38:21.750 --> 38:26.585
There was a fight with another group.
It was a big, b/g group.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.006
We won.

38:33.020 --> 38:34.556
But you didn't stay.

38:34.640 --> 38:38.599
I already left before I left.

38:38.730 --> 38:41.858
I don't understand.

38:41.940 --> 38:44.818
Did they do something?

38:44.900 --> 38:47.027
Or, did you?

38:54.700 --> 38:57.828
I told you things, and that was the trade.

38:58.710 --> 39:02.532
You told me you were with good people
in Virginia, and then you left.

39:02.710 --> 39:07.875
Why, were you trying to get something?
Get away from something?

39:11.090 --> 39:16.926
How about you tell me about you?
t/ke, how’d you get this van?

39:18.890 --> 39:24.010
And why asking total strangers questions
//ke this is so important to you?

39:27.150 --> 39:28.139
Huh?

39:30.410 --> 39:32.059
Look, I saved your ass.

39:32.160 --> 39:33.775
And we saved yours.

39:40.420 --> 39:41.535
0h...

39:41.630 --> 39:43.916
I want to thank you both for your help,

39:44.210 --> 39:47.668
but I think it's time
that I was going on my way.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.216
- What about your leg?
- No, I'm fine.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.928
- Morgan.
- Man, I told you I'm fine.

39:52.390 --> 39:56.804
Tell me one real thing,
then we'll call it even.

39:56.890 --> 39:58.266
Why'd you leave Virginia?

40:03.520 --> 40:07.684
I lose people, and then I lose myself.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.872
Anybody there?

42:13.690 --> 42:16.397
No.

42:35.300 --> 42:36.460
Son of a...

42:54.940 --> 42:58.603
You're wrong. What you said before.

42:58.700 --> 43:00.907
About being on your own.

43:14.670 --> 43:17.377
Here you go. Okay?

43:17.550 --> 43:18.926
Thank you.

43:19.010 --> 43:20.045
Morgan.

43:20.590 --> 43:25.300
That walker, I need to know.

43:25.520 --> 43:28.728
All right. Hey, hey, all right.
Wait, wait, wait. All right.

43:28.810 --> 43:32.803
Give it to me. Come on.

43:32.900 --> 43:34.891
All right.

43:36.940 --> 43:38.942
Thank you.

43:47.330 --> 43:48.649
Okay.

44:32.420 --> 44:34.741
I'm glad we found you.

44:34.920 --> 44:38.708
I'm just travelling
with you till this leg heals up.

44:38.800 --> 44:40.165
And no more questions.

44:40.260 --> 44:45.038
I'm not gonna stop asking you questions.
Especially about that tiger.

44:45.140 --> 44:48.962
- No more answers, then.
- Fair play.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.509
Come on.

44:55.360 --> 44:58.067
It's tasty.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.350
Where we headed?

45:02.450 --> 45:05.817
Well, Al took me back to my truck,
but it wouldn't start.

45:05.910 --> 45:07.650
Now, she's taking me to look for Laura.

45:07.740 --> 45:09.867
In exchange for more of his story.

45:09.950 --> 45:13.579
That's right. That's right.

45:17.840 --> 45:22.049
I don't know if I'll find her.
I don't.

45:22.130 --> 45:27.215
I just don't think about that part
because it don't do me no good.

45:27.350 --> 45:30.763
But I recognise it as truth.

45:30.850 --> 45:33.136
Truth is something you can't get around.

45:33.270 --> 45:35.340
No, you can't.

45:48.870 --> 45:50.189
There's somebody up ahead.

45:52.290 --> 45:55.282
Oh, come on.

46:02.170 --> 46:04.661
Thought you said there weren't
a lot of people around these parts.

46:04.760 --> 46:05.829
There aren't.

46:26.280 --> 46:29.443
- Take this.
- Can't.

46:29.530 --> 46:31.737
I don't kill.

46:34.790 --> 46:37.748
Come on, dude, you gotta answer
some of my questions at some point.

46:37.870 --> 46:40.748
I don't kill, either.
At least I try not to.

46:43.630 --> 46:47.009
Great moment for both of you
to share this fact.

47:25.130 --> 47:26.336
You injured?

47:32.350 --> 47:35.001
- She all right?
- Can you bring the first aid kit?

47:41.730 --> 47:43.015
What happened?

47:48.780 --> 47:53.399
There are bad people.
There are bad people here.

47:53.490 --> 47:54.479
Where?

47:58.250 --> 47:59.490
Drop it.

48:03.920 --> 48:06.081
Hey, hey! Drop it! Drop it!

48:06.170 --> 48:07.580
- Drop it.
- Okay, okay.

48:07.670 --> 48:08.876
Drop it!

48:27.730 --> 48:29.277
So, what the hell's your story?
