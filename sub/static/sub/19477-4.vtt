01:52.800 --> 01:54.720
Yes.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.360
-Hello.
-Hi.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.440
I'll put these on.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.560
-Would you like some help?
-No, I've just started using them,

02:28.640 --> 02:31.080
so I'm not used to this yet.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.000
Are you going to say something?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.840
How are you?

02:56.680 --> 02:58.880
Well, I'm alive, at least.

03:00.760 --> 03:05.960
There's a lot of fuss with surgery
and wounds opening up.

03:06.040 --> 03:09.840
The physiotherapist says
that I'll be able to ride again.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.240
-That's good.
-There we are.

03:23.240 --> 03:27.120
I should've come sooner. I'm sorry.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.720
It's nothing to be scared of,
it's just a couple of legs.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.280
Everything else works.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.600
Could you help me up?

03:44.600 --> 03:48.120
I have to make sure
I don't fall backwards.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.040
Thank you.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.280
-Should I help you with the pants?
-Yes, please.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.120
There, you're good to go.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.600
Where you at the Concert Hall?

04:12.160 --> 04:15.920
At the Concert Hall?
No, I wasn't there.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.240
I saw your name on the guest list.

04:20.839 --> 04:23.800
You haven't been here
since you got back.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.840
You haven't even called me.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.600
And you're wondering
about the Concert Hall?

04:28.680 --> 04:33.840
-No, I just asked if you were there.
-Johan invited me.

04:33.920 --> 04:37.800
I didn't go, because I thought
it'd be nice if you called first.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.880
If this happened to you, would you...

04:47.320 --> 04:50.800
I just think you should've called.
Whatever.

04:51.680 --> 04:55.840
-You're here now. That's nice.
-It's just that...

04:56.720 --> 05:01.760
-It's all different now.
-How do you think I feel?

05:01.840 --> 05:07.080
I have no idea how you feel.
But you're here because...

05:07.160 --> 05:09.320
I've been so angry at you.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.320
Okay.

05:12.400 --> 05:15.880
I'm not supposed to cry. But fuck.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.760
You put yourself
and everyone else in danger.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.640
-You lost your legs.
-Yes.

05:23.720 --> 05:27.960
I just don't know how to react.
I'm sorry.

05:28.040 --> 05:31.240
Just show up.
Visit me and say hi.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.960
THE AFGHANISTAN ASSIGNMENT
IS IN THE NEWSPAPER.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.400
COME TO THE FORTRESS NOW.

06:02.920 --> 06:07.280
The Norwegian Ambassador
and the Foreign Minister are here.

06:08.680 --> 06:13.440
We will escort them and Rolf Inherad
from "Oil for development" tomorrow.

06:14.200 --> 06:18.560
Adella joins us as an interpreter.
She's interpreted for him before.

06:19.720 --> 06:24.800
I know everyone's tired,
but this is what we're trained for.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.880
But if someone has a problem with
a new assignment, tell me tonight.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.880
There will not be consequences
if someone doesn't take part.

06:33.960 --> 06:37.120
Since Jon Petter is away,
Erling will lead the patrol.

06:37.200 --> 06:41.640
-What will happen to him?
-He will not return to active duty.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.960
We're suddenly a very small patrol.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.960
And another thing...

06:52.520 --> 06:55.960
We've been notified about a lot
of hostile activity in the area.

06:56.840 --> 07:00.200
The minister is ignoring
our threat assessment.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.400
Salaam.

07:38.160 --> 07:42.360
-Who is that with Heydar?
-Farouqui, the province governor.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.560
-Is he Taliban?
-40 per cent.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.680
He can do whatever he wants.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.680
This is the oil field.

07:52.320 --> 07:57.400
It's not Ekofisk, but it can provide
the whole province with energy.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.880
Will a Norwegian company extract it?

08:01.960 --> 08:06.760
No, that's not cost-effective.
It will be a local company.

08:07.760 --> 08:11.080
-And the trade agreement?
-That's national.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.840
We're conferring
with the Minister of Power.

08:16.040 --> 08:19.640
Heydar is the landowner's uncle,
who you'll have lunch with.

08:19.720 --> 08:24.120
-Should I come?
-Next time, Rolf.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.040
Today we're
only concerned with politics.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.960
Salaam.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.920
You're wanted.

11:13.680 --> 11:17.280
-What's going on?
-We'll have an unannounced guest.

11:19.240 --> 11:22.560
He understands English,
but prefers to speak Dari.

11:32.920 --> 11:38.040
Nine-eight. Mullah Ahmed
just joined the meeting.

11:38.120 --> 11:41.160
We will enhance security measures.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.160
-Salaam, Mullah.
-Salaam.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.920
He says that there's a breeze.

11:58.120 --> 12:01.760
-Should we just stand by the cars?
-Yes, for now.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.160
For boys.

12:27.040 --> 12:30.120
We don't need
international cooperation.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.760
Sharif says that oil and gas
belongs to the landowner.

13:11.840 --> 13:15.960
Everyone has to do their part
in order to obtain peace.

13:16.040 --> 13:20.360
If everyone can accept the oil
agreement Norway offers,

13:20.440 --> 13:23.120
the Zamani family will also support it.

13:37.520 --> 13:43.520
They need a guarantee from the Taliban
that they can extract the oil in peace.

13:43.600 --> 13:49.440
If not, forget it. They'll get more
profit from the deal with China.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.720
Mullah says: "We'll see."

13:59.160 --> 14:01.880
What are you doing here,
and what do you want?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.680
What are you giving us?

14:21.520 --> 14:23.000
What's in it for us?

14:29.240 --> 14:30.240
Money.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.840
Warriors in an asymmetrical war
always need money.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.720
How much will we get?

14:48.360 --> 14:50.320
You said that we all agreed.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.800
Nine-eight, get the gear ready.

14:54.880 --> 14:58.400
We're getting the hell out of here
when they're done.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.680
Is there any way to solve this
without financing Taliban's warfare?

15:23.880 --> 15:26.440
Then we won't have peace after all.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.960
I'm going back to the Embassy,
I need to make some calls.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.560
-Three-two-Alpha.
-Reading you.

16:32.640 --> 16:36.680
The minister has
a private errand. It'll be quick.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.800
A bonfire.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.160
-I see it too.
-It's the Taliban.

17:13.680 --> 17:17.000
-Over there as well.
-Everyone, get back in the vehicles.

17:18.160 --> 17:22.640
-Johansen, could you request a plane?
-Give me the binoculars.

17:26.319 --> 17:29.840
Excuse me. We have to go.

17:29.920 --> 17:32.920
-What is it?
-We don't want to take any chances.

17:41.160 --> 17:45.120
Copy. We're not on station
for another 35 minutes.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.960
Ninie-eight, the vehicles will be
a hundred meters apart.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.040
What's going on?

18:20.560 --> 18:23.880
-What is it?
-It may be an ambush.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.760
Nine-eight, vehicles two and three
will stay, car one goes up ahead.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.600
We need a better overview.

18:33.640 --> 18:36.160
-Nine-three-two-Alpha.
-Responding.

18:36.240 --> 18:40.560
Could you scramble a drone
and give us an overview?

18:40.640 --> 18:44.720
Three-two-Alpha, we have
a drone overhead already.

18:44.800 --> 18:49.240
Notify us of any activity within
a twenty kilometre radius.

18:53.360 --> 18:58.760
Five vehicles in your direction,
18 kilometres behind you.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.720
Copy. Keep us posted
on the vehicles' position.

19:02.800 --> 19:03.880
Copy.

19:07.880 --> 19:13.040
Hostile vehicles closing in.
They have weapons in all cars.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.360
Copy. Over.

19:16.320 --> 19:20.040
Nine-eight. Vehicle two and three,
come closer to us.

19:20.120 --> 19:24.160
-Drive to the riverbed for cover.
-Copy.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.120
Get the gear out.

19:52.360 --> 19:56.120
-Distance?
-650 metres.

19:59.040 --> 20:03.280
-13 kilometres. Over.
-Copy.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.600
There's a situation. Wait in the car.

20:13.680 --> 20:17.400
-What kind of situation?
-A possible ambush.

20:22.160 --> 20:25.360
-Three-two-Alpha, twelve kilometres.
-Copy.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.520
No visible weapons.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.880
Yes, it's urgent.

20:41.840 --> 20:45.320
Three-two-Alpha, ten kilometres,
closing in fast.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.760
Copy.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.480
They're assessing the situation now.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.200
Could you get Riiser to the car?

21:04.280 --> 21:07.440
-Three-two-Alpha, the minister wants you.
-Copy.

21:12.720 --> 21:16.200
I'll call you back. What's going on?

21:16.280 --> 21:19.960
The situation is critical, to be honest.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.480
There's pressure from behind,

21:22.560 --> 21:26.480
and the only exit is
past an uncontrolled house.

21:26.560 --> 21:30.320
-What can we do?
-Not much without visible weapons.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.760
Get us out of here.

21:36.560 --> 21:40.720
-Three-two-Alpha, nine kilometres.
-Copy.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.960
Six to seven minutes, guys.

21:49.440 --> 21:52.160
-Eight kilometres.
-Copy.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.720
Johansen, any visible weapons?

22:00.800 --> 22:04.320
-No, but they're getting ready.
-Ready for what?

22:04.400 --> 22:07.520
I don't know what,
but something's going down.

22:12.240 --> 22:15.200
To the wall. Get back to the vehicles.

22:15.280 --> 22:19.000
-Seven kilometres. Closing in fast.
-Copy.

22:20.120 --> 22:25.160
-Do you have visible weapons?
-Negative.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.600
Let's take them out.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.560
Three-two-Alpha, six kilometres.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.920
Come on!

23:24.000 --> 23:26.880
Three-two-Alpha, four kilometres.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.520
Damn, it felt good to kill.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.720
No activity on target.

23:45.600 --> 23:49.240
Three-two-Alpha, three kilometres,
closing in fast.

23:57.880 --> 24:00.160
Nine-eight, load the cars, we're leaving.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.200
-Could you check his arm?
-Come with me to the tent.

24:52.280 --> 24:55.040
-Good job, buddy.
-What happened?

24:56.400 --> 24:58.160
-You'll never know.
-Be nice.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.200
Blow yourself while shitting.

25:01.280 --> 25:04.520
-Erling, can we talk?
-Later.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.440
-Do you promise?
-No.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.600
DAMN, IT FELT GOOD TO KILL

25:34.880 --> 25:37.080
This is out of context.

25:37.160 --> 25:42.520
We don't worry about language in war-time.
This, on the other hand...

25:42.600 --> 25:44.160
...kilometres, over.

25:51.440 --> 25:56.840
It was put online this morning.
This will be harder to justify.

25:56.920 --> 26:00.520
-Any visible weapons?
-No, but they're getting ready.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.200
I don't know what,
but something's going down.

26:03.280 --> 26:06.840
-Any visible weapons?
-Negative.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.880
Let's take them out.

26:11.520 --> 26:14.000
Was the reporter allowed to film?

26:14.080 --> 26:19.840
-There was no reporter.
-Stolen footage? How'd he get it?

26:19.920 --> 26:23.080
-He stole it.
-Equipment should be locked away.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.880
-I was in the hospital.
-And the day after?

26:25.960 --> 26:28.840
-We said it was stolen.
-I always have my camera.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.480
Did the reporter
send anything in advance?

26:31.560 --> 26:35.880
I got an article this morning.
This mission was not mentioned.

26:35.960 --> 26:40.120
-We have a right to answer.
-Not to breaking news, which this is.

26:41.280 --> 26:43.120
Damn, it felt good to kill.

26:45.240 --> 26:48.840
It's an unfortunate comment,
but that's happened before.

26:48.920 --> 26:52.480
Opening fire before being shot at
is generally not allowed.

26:52.560 --> 26:57.080
-We escorted the minister.
-We know, but we can't say that.

26:57.600 --> 27:01.680
I'll contact the Ministry,
and you'll stay here for now.

27:01.760 --> 27:07.000
The reporter probably won't name
names, but we'll take no chances.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.400
Thank you.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.440
The Defence Minister has made a statement.

27:13.360 --> 27:18.680
"The minister disapproves,
and will assemble an ethical counsel."

27:18.760 --> 27:23.560
"It's important to address the bad
culture of unacceptable language."

27:23.640 --> 27:27.920
It's important to stress
that what we've seen today,

27:28.000 --> 27:33.680
is just a small aspect of
a very professional organization.

27:33.760 --> 27:36.640
The Defence Minister
places blame downwards.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.000
Precisely.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.880
Well...

27:45.280 --> 27:51.440
-How do I relate to the soldiers?
-You don't. This is a subculture.

27:51.520 --> 27:55.280
Isn't it important to inform
the public of the entire case?

27:59.560 --> 28:03.160
It's not a subculture,
and we can't inform the public.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.080
-They were escorting me.
-I see.

28:13.840 --> 28:17.680
-That should not be made public.
-No.

28:19.080 --> 28:22.080
We can't tell anyone
that I met Mullah Ahmed,

28:22.160 --> 28:26.760
or that he or his opposition in
the Taliban tried to kill me afterwards.

28:28.520 --> 28:34.720
-May I ask why you tempted fate?
-No. Let's move on.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.360
-Who was in command?
-Patrol leader Erling Riiser.

28:41.240 --> 28:43.240
This just keeps getting better.

28:49.760 --> 28:53.320
Special Operations Forces
wants to meet. What do we do?

28:54.160 --> 28:55.880
We'll meet them.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.480
-There you are.
-I'm sorry, we're very busy.

29:01.560 --> 29:05.600
The US Secretary of Defence is coming
to hear about "the Norwegian way":

29:05.680 --> 29:08.800
Norwegian humanitarian work in war areas.

29:08.880 --> 29:12.840
I thought we could
go through our presentation.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.040
I really don't have time now.

29:15.120 --> 29:19.600
Should we let him think we're
as aggressive and imperial as them,

29:19.680 --> 29:22.400
or give him
a humanitarian alternative?

29:22.480 --> 29:26.640
-How about a reality check?
-So I can't speak frankly?

29:26.720 --> 29:29.600
-I'll call you later, Hektor.
-Alright.

29:30.520 --> 29:34.600
He's a bit eager, but he's done
wonders with Fruit for Life.

29:34.680 --> 29:35.840
A bit too eager.

29:36.760 --> 29:39.640
Why is the Secretary of Defence coming?

29:39.720 --> 29:41.840
-To meet me.
-Okay.

30:04.480 --> 30:06.240
Have a seat.

30:06.320 --> 30:11.040
If I didn't say it the last time,
I'll say it now: Thank you so much.

30:12.560 --> 30:16.040
And a special thanks to Johansen,
who was hit.

30:16.120 --> 30:20.080
It was spectacularly well done.
How's the arm?

30:20.160 --> 30:24.200
-It's good, thanks for asking.
-Johansen, Hanefi, Bakkeli.

30:24.280 --> 30:28.400
Take the pizza and wait outside.
Riiser, you'll stay.

30:35.160 --> 30:39.200
The Ministry has sent us to war,
but are turning their backs on us.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.920
I'll be blunt:
Are you with us or against us?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.400
-With you.
-Good. What do we do?

30:45.480 --> 30:49.000
The Defence Minister and the
reporter will be on the news tonight.

30:49.080 --> 30:52.440
-They want you to send a soldier.
-We didn't know.

30:52.520 --> 30:56.920
-You do now.
-Riiser would be great on TV.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.760
Special ops soldiers are anonymous.
They can't be on TV.

31:02.520 --> 31:06.280
There's one special ops soldier
who won't be on active duty again.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.640
Jon Petter? You can't do that.

31:08.720 --> 31:14.400
I don't want to reveal Jon Petter's
identity and make him a target.

31:14.480 --> 31:17.000
-He's been discharged.
-He lost his legs.

31:17.080 --> 31:21.280
But he's smart and eloquent.
His injury will look good on TV.

31:22.360 --> 31:26.160
We have no idea
if he can handle an interview on TV.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.520
I've visited him, he seems fine.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.600
What do you think?

31:33.680 --> 31:38.040
I agree with Erling.
I don't think Jon Petter's ready for this.

31:39.320 --> 31:42.960
Erling, if Jon Petter can outsmart
the Minister of Defence,

31:43.040 --> 31:46.680
who's stabbing you
and the patrol in the back,

31:46.760 --> 31:51.840
we'll regain the trust of thousands
of soldiers and their families.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.680
I'm certain that he can do it.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.840
-They want me to clean up the mess?
-Yes.

32:06.040 --> 32:09.080
"Yes, no, I don't know, no comment."

32:09.160 --> 32:13.520
I can't come off as an idiot
in front of the Minister. No way.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.800
I have to be smarter than that.

32:17.720 --> 32:21.840
-Stop talking crap.
-Copy.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.080
-What's in it for me?
-Not much.

32:27.160 --> 32:32.320
You're supposed to remedy people's
impression of the Special Forces.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.000
Okay. Forget it.

32:36.440 --> 32:37.880
Okay.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.400
I don't understand what's happened.

32:46.640 --> 32:50.480
You said to fire when they
didn't have visible weapons.

32:53.160 --> 32:56.960
-Who did you escort?
-The Foreign Minister.

32:57.040 --> 33:00.200
-Yes. That's what no one can know.
-Correct.

33:02.440 --> 33:06.480
-What about Adella?
-She's on assignment.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.560
What kind of assignment?

33:12.080 --> 33:17.920
You're asking me to go on TV
as a national cripple, for your sake,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.720
and you still can't tell me anything?

33:20.800 --> 33:23.440
She's guarding Wasima Zamani.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.400
Is Wasima Zamani in Norway?

33:27.200 --> 33:31.840
-Why's Adella guarding her?
-Someone tried to kill her.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.360
In Norway? Oh my God.

33:36.800 --> 33:41.960
-She can never catch a break.
-Sharif Zamani tried to kill her.

33:43.640 --> 33:48.480
This is just insane.
Why was Zamani in Norway?

33:49.960 --> 33:53.000
-That's what I'm trying to find out.
-Okay.

33:55.040 --> 33:57.000
I have to do this myself.

34:01.680 --> 34:05.400
-What will happen with Zamani?
-With him?

34:06.960 --> 34:10.480
-He's dead.
-Well, that's good.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.199
I killed him.

34:22.600 --> 34:26.080
-Tell them I can't do it.
-That's fine.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.360
-At least I tried.
-Yeah.

34:35.080 --> 34:39.760
Adella says she's called,
but you don't answer or call back.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.320
-Is that true?
-Yes.

34:44.480 --> 34:47.639
-Why?
-Because my back hurts.

34:47.719 --> 34:51.880
I have blisters on my stumps,
phantom pains in my ankles

34:51.960 --> 34:55.159
and I never get
more than three hours of sleep.

34:55.239 --> 34:59.880
I will never get naked in front
of a woman again. Or ride again.

34:59.960 --> 35:04.200
The army's discharged me.
I've lost everything.

35:05.920 --> 35:11.160
When someone asks me
how I'm doing, I answer: "Fine."

35:11.240 --> 35:15.880
I can finally eat pizza and watch TV
without feeling guilty.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.000
So, yeah...

35:22.400 --> 35:24.200
I'm not going to call her.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.800
Would you go on TV
if the army reinstated you?

35:30.400 --> 35:36.080
If you could be there in uniform,
with a medal, is that worth anything?

35:36.160 --> 35:40.200
-They've never reinstated anyone.
-That's not what I'm asking.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.600
Think about it.

35:53.400 --> 35:57.080
NRK News has gained access
to unique footage

35:57.160 --> 35:59.520
from an assignment in Afghanistan.

35:59.600 --> 36:05.120
No visible weapons,
but something's going down.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.120
-Any visible weapons?
-Negative.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.440
Let's take them out.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.760
Damn, it felt good to kill.

36:15.680 --> 36:19.640
Rasch, you stayed with these men
in Afghanistan.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.800
Do you understand their behaviour?

36:21.880 --> 36:27.040
Yes, to a certain extent.
They're in extreme situations.

36:27.120 --> 36:32.200
They lose their own soldiers,
and that affects the psyche.

36:32.280 --> 36:36.000
It's important that the press
is present to document it.

36:36.080 --> 36:40.440
What do you, as Defence Minister,
think about this news?

36:40.520 --> 36:45.800
I think it bears witness of a culture
we don't want to be associated with.

36:45.880 --> 36:49.160
More openness is important.

36:49.240 --> 36:56.000
That will start a discussion about
our presence in Afghanistan.

36:56.080 --> 37:02.680
We may risk revealing bad culture,
but we can handle that risk.

37:02.760 --> 37:06.760
Rasch has seen footage
of soldiers who open fire

37:06.840 --> 37:10.640
without being subjected
to any real threat.

37:10.720 --> 37:14.880
Is there any way to justify
what is seemingly an execution?

37:15.520 --> 37:19.560
There's probably a military explanation.

37:19.640 --> 37:24.080
When young men are given guns,
something happens to their psyche.

37:24.160 --> 37:29.720
One of the soldiers you were with
in Afghanistan is joining us.

37:30.840 --> 37:35.040
-We'll let him get situated.
-Just one second.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.800
-Jon Petter Hals, welcome.
-Thank you.

37:39.880 --> 37:44.720
You were a soldier
in the Special Armed Forces.

37:44.800 --> 37:49.040
What's your view on the information
that's been revealed today?

37:50.320 --> 37:54.840
I'd like to say that war and peace
are two completely different things.

37:56.120 --> 38:01.280
If a man, during peace time,
throws acid in a woman's face,

38:01.360 --> 38:06.320
cuts off her breasts, and gathers
his friends to stone her to death,

38:06.400 --> 38:10.680
most people would say
that he deserves prison.

38:10.760 --> 38:16.360
There's no doubt that you experience
extreme scenarios in Afghanistan.

38:16.440 --> 38:22.640
But there are rules describing when
a soldier can and can't use weapons.

38:22.720 --> 38:27.200
I wasn't finished.
It's against human nature to kill.

38:27.280 --> 38:31.240
That's why most murders
are crimes of passion.

38:31.320 --> 38:35.960
The soldiers in the Special Forces
are trained to kill.

38:36.040 --> 38:39.440
We never act out of anger.

38:39.520 --> 38:42.920
In such a scenario,
we would not kill the man.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.120
-What if the woman died?
-We wouldn't kill him.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.400
It's war, not peace.

38:48.480 --> 38:51.600
We'd kill him
if he pointed a weapon at us.

38:51.680 --> 38:58.160
I find it odd that Hals claims the
soldiers are practically unfazed.

38:58.240 --> 39:00.000
But in this video,

39:00.080 --> 39:04.120
you're clearly marked by
the gravity of the situation.

39:04.200 --> 39:09.400
Not acting out of passion is not
the same as not being human.

39:09.480 --> 39:13.760
There's a difference between
basing the operation on emotions

39:13.840 --> 39:18.080
and dealing with feelings later.
There are protocols for that.

39:18.160 --> 39:22.720
The press needs to be present
to report on ethical violations.

39:22.800 --> 39:27.800
The video shows
how the patrol proceeds with force.

39:27.880 --> 39:32.000
It looks like they are slaughtering
their way through a valley.

39:33.640 --> 39:35.360
Those are your words.

39:36.840 --> 39:42.080
The camera doesn't show
what's behind the soldiers.

39:42.160 --> 39:44.680
What is behind the soldiers?

39:49.120 --> 39:52.240
The Norwegian government's war policy.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.040
Please elaborate.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.520
Our warfare is symmetrical.

39:57.600 --> 40:01.960
In other words, our reaction
should be equal to the threat.

40:03.000 --> 40:07.880
The patrol leader who chose to open fire,
made the right decision.

40:09.160 --> 40:13.560
Rasch, do you recognize
the threat the soldier mentions?

40:13.640 --> 40:16.760
I recognize
what's in front of the camera.

40:16.840 --> 40:23.440
Behind it is a military assessment
which I'm not qualified to make.

40:23.520 --> 40:28.160
I'm just making the footage public
to discuss any ethical violations.

40:28.240 --> 40:31.120
You keep saying "ethical violations".

40:31.200 --> 40:36.120
You shouldn't be so cocky when
you speak about ethical violations.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.440
The cameras we have on our helmets...

40:39.520 --> 40:42.640
It would be nice if you
gave back the one you stole.

40:42.720 --> 40:45.560
Did you steal a camera?

40:45.640 --> 40:51.800
This is a bold statement from Hals.
He's a soldier, I'm a journalist.

40:51.880 --> 40:55.440
My job is to reveal the truth
so that it can be discussed.

40:55.520 --> 40:59.360
Is this footage
from a stolen camera?

40:59.440 --> 41:02.920
-My job as a journalist...
-Answer the question.

41:03.000 --> 41:08.400
My job is to reveal the truth.
Whether the law has been broken,

41:08.480 --> 41:11.240
is for the courts to decide, not Hals.

41:11.320 --> 41:14.480
We will investigate this case.

41:14.560 --> 41:18.800
We need to know what happened
before we make a statement.

41:18.880 --> 41:21.320
-Copy.
-It looks very brutal.

41:21.400 --> 41:26.160
Special ops soldiers
are not afraid of losing face.

41:26.240 --> 41:29.840
We save lives.
We're an anti-terrorist group.

41:29.920 --> 41:34.840
So you can't relate
to this war-culture at all?

41:34.920 --> 41:38.200
Of course I do. We're soldiers.

41:41.360 --> 41:44.880
Thank you both for coming.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.080
I'm good. Thank you.

42:03.880 --> 42:07.080
Humiliated and stripped. Soon,
you'll receive something interesting.

42:43.400 --> 42:46.160
Wait, listen to me.
I have a story for you.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.880
Now. So I have to talk to you.

42:49.800 --> 42:53.240
Now! I'll stop by your office. Bye.

43:45.960 --> 43:51.200
