07:50.762 --> 07:52.389
look at the time?

07:52.431 --> 07:53.890
Um, I've got an audition.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.350
I don't wanna be late.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.684
I don't get it.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.313
I'll-I'll walk you out.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.355
Oh, that's okay.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.355
That's okay.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.565
Okay.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.565
Good luck.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.900
Have a great audition.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.194
Just don't use that

08:03.942 --> 08:06.194
"Knock, knock" joke.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.322
Bye.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.657
- Bye, Roxy.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.657
- 'Bye.'

08:10.698 --> 08:12.826
Oh, you guys, I know

08:10.698 --> 08:12.826
she wasn't funny just now

08:12.867 --> 08:15.370
but she was really nervous

08:12.867 --> 08:15.370
about meeting all of you.

08:15.412 --> 08:16.830
Oh, no, Joey,

08:15.412 --> 08:16.830
everything is okay.

08:16.871 --> 08:17.831
She seemed really nice.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.249
Yeah, she seemed very nice.

08:19.291 --> 08:20.500
Yeah but you can't

08:19.291 --> 08:20.500
really know her

08:20.541 --> 08:22.043
until you see

08:20.541 --> 08:22.043
how funny she is.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.254
You guys have to see her

08:22.085 --> 08:24.254
in her element.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.756
Uh, Sunday night is comedy night

08:24.296 --> 08:26.756
at The Smash Club.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.967
Why don't you guys come

08:26.798 --> 08:28.967
and watch her act?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.760
Uh-oh, okay. You know,

08:29.009 --> 08:30.760
we'll make a night of it.

08:30.802 --> 08:31.886
Great.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.180
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.180
- Cool.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.390
Give me a cracker,

08:33.221 --> 08:35.390
fat head.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.891
[squawking]

08:36.933 --> 08:39.769
Yeah and why don't we leave

08:36.933 --> 08:39.769
Little Sid at home?

08:40.479 --> 08:42.272
[laughing]

08:46.318 --> 08:48.362
So, I'll need the two-hour

08:46.318 --> 08:48.362
dust buster battery.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.488
Thanks.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.698
- Hey, dad.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.698
- 'Hey.'

08:51.739 --> 08:53.200
- Hi, dad.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.200
- Hey.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.742
So, how did it go?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.286
Two Sid's have a happy reunion?

08:56.328 --> 08:58.997
Oh, you should've seen

08:56.328 --> 08:58.997
the flapping and squawking.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.416
Yeah. And the bird was

08:59.039 --> 09:01.416
pretty excited, too.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.252
Yeah, and we got

09:02.542 --> 09:04.252
a great reward.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.420
Big Sid said we could

09:04.294 --> 09:05.420
get one thing

09:05.462 --> 09:07.088
from his catalog.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.716
So, obviously, we're gonna go

09:07.130 --> 09:09.716
for the big screen TV.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.426
Not so obviously.

09:11.468 --> 09:12.635
We already have a TV.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.888
What we need is

09:12.677 --> 09:14.888
a karaoke machine.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.140
I always wanted

09:14.929 --> 09:17.140
one of those.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.476
What is it?

09:20.768 --> 09:22.812
Well, a karaoke machine

09:20.768 --> 09:22.812
plays music

09:22.854 --> 09:25.190
and shows you the words

09:22.854 --> 09:25.190
so you can sing along.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.275
I knew it sounded cool.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.152
No, what sounds cool

09:29.194 --> 09:32.864
is "55 inches of

09:29.194 --> 09:32.864
pure viewing pleasure."

09:32.906 --> 09:34.157
What do you think, Steve?

09:34.199 --> 09:35.783
Well, you know,

09:34.199 --> 09:35.783
those karaoke machines

09:35.825 --> 09:37.077
are a lot of fun.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.206
Of course, nothing

09:39.496 --> 09:41.206
can possibly beat

09:41.248 --> 09:43.791
the thrill of watching

09:41.248 --> 09:43.791
Willard Scott

09:43.833 --> 09:46.420
bigger than life

09:43.833 --> 09:46.420
right in your own living room.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.049
I'm just gonna flip through

09:49.005 --> 09:51.049
the catalog right over here.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.095
Okay, I want

09:52.759 --> 09:55.095
the big screen TV

09:55.136 --> 09:57.305
and you want

09:55.136 --> 09:57.305
the karaoke machine.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.973
Let's decide this fairly.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.017
I'm older. TV.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.017
Case closed.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.104
You can't do that.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.104
Dad, can she do that?

10:04.145 --> 10:05.146
She can't do that.

10:05.188 --> 10:07.899
Dad says

10:05.188 --> 10:07.899
you can't do that.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.650
Okay Michelle, sweetie,

10:07.941 --> 10:09.650
it's up to you.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.194
You have the

10:09.692 --> 10:11.194
deciding vote here.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.695
- Michelle?

10:12.737 --> 10:14.781
Yeah, the little blonde

10:12.737 --> 10:14.781
that lives upstairs?

10:16.741 --> 10:18.326
That would be me.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.047
Kimmy, you got table six.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.966
No way.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.966
I don't want those losers.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.385
They complain,

10:33.007 --> 10:35.385
they're horrible tippers.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.471
And they treat me

10:35.427 --> 10:37.471
like a slave girl.

10:37.512 --> 10:38.638
Fine, I'll take 'em.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.350
Hi.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.350
What can I get you?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.396
Oh.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.231
I hope your family

10:46.438 --> 10:48.231
likes me tonight.

10:48.273 --> 10:50.066
I worked them

10:48.273 --> 10:50.066
into the act.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.068
That is so great.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.068
They're gonna love that.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.907
Okay, enough of that.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.907
Enough of that.

10:57.949 --> 10:58.950
You ready?

10:58.992 --> 11:00.410
Well, it's now or never.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.370
Actually, it's-it's now.

11:02.412 --> 11:05.123
Hey, boss man,

11:02.412 --> 11:05.123
we're out of napkins.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.916
Oh, well, alright,

11:05.165 --> 11:06.916
I'll take care of it.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.543
Run along, Kimmy.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.543
Get lost.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.004
Okay, thanks for the pep talk.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.004
You're a real motivator.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.929
Thank you.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.765
Welcome to comedy night

11:19.971 --> 11:22.765
here at The Smash Club.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.392
Uh, now I have

11:22.807 --> 11:24.392
an announcement to make.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.521
In our ongoing effort to

11:24.434 --> 11:27.521
preserve the environment

11:27.562 --> 11:29.564
uh, we're doing away

11:27.562 --> 11:29.564
with all paper napkins.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.651
It's "Use your sleeve night"

11:29.606 --> 11:32.651
here at The Smash Club.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.654
Okay, thanks.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.572
Now, uh, now up

11:37.614 --> 11:40.241
is-is a very funny

11:37.614 --> 11:40.241
and talented young lady.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.536
Let's give a big hand

11:40.283 --> 11:42.536
for Roxy Mardin.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.250
Well, thank you.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.250
Thank you.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.169
Well, I'm in a great

11:49.292 --> 11:51.169
mood tonight

11:51.211 --> 11:53.004
'cause I'm in a

11:51.211 --> 11:53.004
new relationship.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.507
Hi, Joey.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.425
You know, my friends

11:55.549 --> 11:57.425
always ask me

11:57.467 --> 11:58.843
"How can you

11:57.467 --> 11:58.843
go out with a guy

11:58.885 --> 12:00.761
who's so obsessed

11:58.885 --> 12:00.761
with cartoons?"

12:00.803 --> 12:02.347
I say, "Hey, there's

12:00.803 --> 12:02.347
more to Joey

12:02.389 --> 12:04.432
"than silly voices

12:02.389 --> 12:04.432
and impressions

12:04.474 --> 12:06.184
there's also rude noises."

12:09.103 --> 12:10.771
He brought the family

12:09.103 --> 12:10.771
down tonight.

12:10.813 --> 12:11.898
Guys, guys, take a bow.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.858
Stand up, take a bow.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.279
I'm sure you recognize

12:16.444 --> 12:18.279
Danny Tanner

12:18.321 --> 12:21.282
and Rebecca Donaldson from

12:18.321 --> 12:21.282
"Wake up, San Francisco."

12:24.494 --> 12:25.704
I've seen that show.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.788
Go back to bed,

12:25.744 --> 12:27.788
San Francisco.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.999
[audience laughing]

12:30.041 --> 12:32.043
Oh, unfortunately,

12:30.041 --> 12:32.043
when you meet them in person

12:32.085 --> 12:33.420
there's no mute button.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.756
Danny has three daughters

12:37.798 --> 12:39.384
D.J., Stephanie,

12:37.798 --> 12:39.384
and Michelle.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.428
And you know, they have fights

12:39.426 --> 12:41.428
that most sisters have.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.471
You know, eye gouging,

12:41.469 --> 12:43.471
hair pulling

12:43.513 --> 12:45.806
an occasional ball-peen

12:43.513 --> 12:45.806
hammer to the head.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.311
They're like the three stooges

12:47.475 --> 12:50.311
in panty hose.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.063
[audience laughing]

12:52.105 --> 12:53.481
[chuckles]

12:56.693 --> 12:58.903
Michelle, that's not funny.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.488
She's making us

12:58.945 --> 13:00.488
look like dorks.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.782
The nerve.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.203
And what can I say about Jesse?

13:07.245 --> 13:08.829
He has great hair.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.666
He also has enough oil

13:08.871 --> 13:11.666
on his head to join OPEC.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.671
You know the spill last summer?

13:16.713 --> 13:18.923
That was Jesse

13:16.713 --> 13:18.923
rinsing out his comb.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.008
[audience laughing]

13:27.056 --> 13:28.725
Hey, I told you guys

13:27.056 --> 13:28.725
she's funny.

13:28.767 --> 13:29.892
She's killing up there.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.107
And you're not laughing.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.735
No, we're not.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.654
But thanks for

13:38.777 --> 13:40.654
inviting us, Joey.

13:40.695 --> 13:41.946
What do you have planned

13:40.695 --> 13:41.946
for us next?

13:41.988 --> 13:43.615
The beating

13:41.988 --> 13:43.615
in the parking lot?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.410
[audience cheering]

13:48.745 --> 13:51.038
Whoa, thank you,

13:48.745 --> 13:51.038
thank you.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.714
[instrumental music]

14:01.299 --> 14:03.009
Okay, boys, you ready?

14:03.050 --> 14:05.178
We're gonna make animals

14:03.050 --> 14:05.178
out of this Play-Doh, okay.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.888
Here's your animal.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.888
There you go.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.432
Where's Toey?

14:11.850 --> 14:13.394
Well, honey,

14:11.850 --> 14:13.394
Joey has a new friend

14:13.436 --> 14:16.022
and he's been spending

14:13.436 --> 14:16.022
a lot of time with her.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.817
We want Toey!

14:18.857 --> 14:20.360
We want Toey!

14:20.401 --> 14:22.737
- We want Toey!

14:22.779 --> 14:24.030
Alright, okay.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.740
Alright, boys, I know.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.740
I know, I know.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.367
You like making

14:25.782 --> 14:27.367
animals with Joey

14:27.408 --> 14:29.202
because he makes all

14:27.408 --> 14:29.202
the funny noises.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.788
But hey, your old man's

14:29.243 --> 14:31.788
been known

14:31.830 --> 14:34.582
to make a few funny noises

14:31.830 --> 14:34.582
in his time.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.834
Did you know that?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.084
Alright, you guys,

14:35.875 --> 14:37.084
give me an animal.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.336
Jus-jus-just give

14:37.126 --> 14:38.336
me any animal

14:38.378 --> 14:39.587
right off the top

14:38.378 --> 14:39.587
of your head.

14:39.629 --> 14:40.755
Go ahead, shoot.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.507
Hippopotamus.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.804
Okay, alright.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.804
I-I'll..

14:47.846 --> 14:49.597
I'll try to

14:47.846 --> 14:49.597
doing a hippopotamus.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.766
[clearing throat]

14:53.059 --> 14:54.268
Hey..

14:54.310 --> 14:56.688
I'm a big, fat,

14:54.310 --> 14:56.688
muddy hippopotamus.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.274
-We want Toey!

15:00.316 --> 15:01.776
- We want Toey!

15:01.818 --> 15:05.029
- We want Toey!

15:05.071 --> 15:07.323
- We want Toey!

15:08.491 --> 15:09.992
- Yay!

15:11.578 --> 15:13.079
Oh, Joey, thank goodness

15:11.578 --> 15:13.079
you're here.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.789
We really could

15:13.120 --> 15:14.789
use your help.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.625
Jesse's hippo

15:14.831 --> 15:17.625
is kind of lame-o.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.922
I'll play with

15:20.169 --> 15:22.922
you guys later.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.257
Well, it took a

15:22.963 --> 15:24.257
couple of days

15:24.298 --> 15:26.175
but I see you got

15:24.298 --> 15:26.175
your sense of humor back.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.261
Come on, Joey.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.722
Roxy , uh, she ambushed us

15:28.302 --> 15:30.722
up there on that stage.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.348
Right, Danny?

15:32.390 --> 15:35.393
Uh, I wouldn't say ambush

15:32.390 --> 15:35.393
so much as bushwhacked.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.145
Come on, Danny.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.481
Ah, sorry. Maybe I'll just

15:38.187 --> 15:40.481
press my mute button.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.526
You guys don't understand.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.278
When a comic makes a

15:43.568 --> 15:45.278
joke about you

15:45.319 --> 15:47.405
it's the highest compliment.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.699
Well, Joey, she really

15:47.447 --> 15:49.699
embarrassed us.

15:49.741 --> 15:52.326
And we didn't think

15:49.741 --> 15:52.326
it was funny.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.870
Well, if you don't

15:52.368 --> 15:53.870
think she's funny

15:53.912 --> 15:56.247
that's the same as saying

15:53.912 --> 15:56.247
you don't like her.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.707
Is that what you guys

15:56.289 --> 15:57.707
are saying?

15:59.751 --> 16:00.752
(Joey)

15:59.751 --> 16:00.752
'Alright, fine.'

16:00.794 --> 16:02.295
No, I get it.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.547
Well, I don't know

16:02.336 --> 16:04.547
how to tell you guys this

16:04.589 --> 16:05.965
but if you don't

16:04.589 --> 16:05.965
wanna be around her

16:06.006 --> 16:07.508
you're not gonna

16:06.006 --> 16:07.508
be around me.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.554
Joey. Joey.

16:13.306 --> 16:16.434
Alright, maybe, maybe we

16:13.306 --> 16:16.434
were oversensitive

16:16.476 --> 16:18.812
about a couple

16:16.476 --> 16:18.812
of points.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.775
Yeah, maybe Roxy shouldn't have

16:20.688 --> 16:23.775
made fun of the girls.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.568
I was talking

16:23.817 --> 16:25.568
about my hair.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.072
Joey, if Roxy's

16:28.696 --> 16:30.072
important to you

16:30.114 --> 16:31.741
she's important to us.

16:31.783 --> 16:34.118
Yeah. You know what, buddy,

16:31.783 --> 16:34.118
let's give it another shot.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.995
What do you say we invite her

16:34.160 --> 16:35.995
over for dinner tonight, huh?

16:36.036 --> 16:37.956
- It's a good idea.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.956
- Yeah.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.249
- You sure?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.249
- Absolutely.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.794
[imitates Ren]

16:40.291 --> 16:42.794
Oh, Stimpy, you couldn't

16:40.291 --> 16:42.794
make me happier

16:42.836 --> 16:45.087
if you spanked me

16:42.836 --> 16:45.087
with a big, wet waffle.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.591
Ahh.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.471
Well, this should be

16:52.219 --> 16:53.471
interesting.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.181
Roxy's coming over

16:53.513 --> 16:55.181
for dinner.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.016
What the heck are

16:55.222 --> 16:57.016
we gonna make for her?

16:57.057 --> 16:58.434
Anything but..

16:58.476 --> 17:00.520
[imitates Ren]

16:58.476 --> 17:00.520
...big, wet waffles.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.401
Hey, what are

17:06.275 --> 17:07.401
you watching?

17:07.443 --> 17:08.695
Cartoons.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.906
Oh, yeah, it is.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.533
Yeah, everything

17:11.948 --> 17:13.533
looks so small

17:13.574 --> 17:16.160
I thought it was a commercial

17:13.574 --> 17:16.160
for an ant farm.

17:18.621 --> 17:22.458
Imagine having

17:18.621 --> 17:22.458
a big screen TV.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.585
You know, you could

17:22.500 --> 17:24.585
watch "Tiny Toons"

17:24.627 --> 17:26.754
and everything

17:24.627 --> 17:26.754
wouldn't look so tiny.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.967
What are you doing?

17:31.009 --> 17:32.719
Just talking

17:31.009 --> 17:32.719
to my sister.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.721
I know what you're up to.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.014
You're trying to

17:34.762 --> 17:36.014
talk Michelle

17:36.055 --> 17:37.682
into the big screen TV.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.225
So what if I am?

17:39.266 --> 17:41.853
You're working on her

17:39.266 --> 17:41.853
day and night.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.396
Yeah right, like

17:41.895 --> 17:43.396
I'm sitting there

17:43.437 --> 17:45.648
at 3:00 in the morning

17:43.437 --> 17:45.648
whispering in her ear

17:45.690 --> 17:48.067
"Karaoke machine,

17:45.690 --> 17:48.067
karaoke machine."

17:48.108 --> 17:50.152
That was<i> you.</i>

17:53.698 --> 17:54.866
- Karaoke.

17:53.698 --> 17:54.866
- Big screen.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.200
- Karaoke.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.200
- Big screen.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.452
Dad! Please!

17:58.494 --> 18:00.955
Help! Help!

17:58.494 --> 18:00.955
Please!

18:00.997 --> 18:02.206
What's the matter, honey?

18:02.248 --> 18:04.417
Make the voices stop!

18:07.587 --> 18:09.255
Alright,

18:07.587 --> 18:09.255
D.J., Stephanie

18:09.296 --> 18:11.382
move away from your sister.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.300
Okay, sweetheart, we're gonna

18:11.424 --> 18:13.300
settle this once and for all.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.053
I'm taking you down

18:13.342 --> 18:15.053
to Big Sid's

18:15.094 --> 18:17.638
and you and you alone are

18:15.094 --> 18:17.638
gonna make the decision, okay?

18:17.680 --> 18:19.265
Dad, that's not fair.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.265
You can't just have--

18:19.306 --> 18:22.393
Without Siskel and Ebert

18:19.306 --> 18:22.393
screaming in your ear.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.478
Okay, quick. Get in the car.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.478
Go, go, go, go.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.939
But, dad--

18:25.980 --> 18:27.774
Uh, Not another word.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.774
Get in the car, Michelle.

18:27.815 --> 18:28.900
I'm coming.

18:30.401 --> 18:32.028
- Karaoke.

18:30.401 --> 18:32.028
- Big screen.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.947
- Karaoke.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.947
- Big screen.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.197
Get the karaoke machine!

18:35.239 --> 18:36.657
Big screen,

18:35.239 --> 18:36.657
Big screen TV

18:40.369 --> 18:43.790
D.J., Stephanie, we're back.

18:43.831 --> 18:44.916
Did you get

18:43.831 --> 18:44.916
the big screen?

18:44.958 --> 18:45.917
Karaoke?

18:45.959 --> 18:47.209
Nope.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.218
Well..

18:56.260 --> 18:58.512
...Michelle finally found

18:56.260 --> 18:58.512
something that she liked.

19:01.724 --> 19:04.060
- That's it?

19:01.724 --> 19:04.060
- Pretty cool, huh?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.021
What were you thinkin'?

19:07.063 --> 19:10.441
I decided this is something

19:07.063 --> 19:10.441
we can all enjoy.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.821
I'm sorry, girls.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.821
It was Michelle's decision.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.156
Personally, I-I lobbied

19:14.862 --> 19:17.156
for the washer-dryer.

19:18.574 --> 19:22.578
This way we could always

19:18.574 --> 19:22.578
remember Little Sid.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.455
Big Sid's kind of cute, too.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.375
- Hey.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.543
What's Big Sid doin' here?

19:29.585 --> 19:31.087
He lives here now.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.506
Well, I guess we could

19:31.129 --> 19:33.506
prop it up in the window

19:33.547 --> 19:35.675
and scare the heck out of

19:33.547 --> 19:35.675
the Amway lady.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.801
[car door closing]

19:36.843 --> 19:39.095
Okay, that would be

19:36.843 --> 19:39.095
Joey and Roxy.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.514
Now guys, we wanna be

19:39.137 --> 19:41.514
really nice to her, okay.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.265
But, dad, she insulted us.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.934
I know that, but Joey

19:43.307 --> 19:44.934
really cares about her.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.560
We gotta give her

19:44.976 --> 19:46.560
a second chance, okay.

19:46.602 --> 19:47.937
Let's just be

19:46.602 --> 19:47.937
good sports

19:47.979 --> 19:49.647
and show her somehow that

19:47.979 --> 19:49.647
we really like her.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.649
How do we do that?

19:51.691 --> 19:54.819
Well, I guess

19:51.691 --> 19:54.819
a good way would be

19:54.861 --> 19:56.112
to laugh at

19:54.861 --> 19:56.112
all of her jokes.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.864
What if they're

19:56.154 --> 19:57.864
not funny?

19:57.905 --> 20:00.240
Laugh anyway.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.201
No, your dad's right.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.201
If we wanna keep Joey

20:02.242 --> 20:03.327
we're gonna have to laugh

20:03.369 --> 20:04.745
like we've never

20:03.369 --> 20:04.745
laughed before.

20:04.787 --> 20:07.040
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.002
What was that?

20:11.044 --> 20:13.462
I never laughed

20:11.044 --> 20:13.462
like that before.

20:18.342 --> 20:21.428
Why are we doing this?

20:18.342 --> 20:21.428
They don't like me.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.431
Oh, no. They just don't

20:21.470 --> 20:24.431
know you like I know you.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.017
You gotta give 'em

20:24.473 --> 20:26.017
another chance.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.311
I just don't wanna bomb

20:26.059 --> 20:29.311
with your family again.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.772
Well, then this time..

20:31.814 --> 20:32.940
...don't worry

20:31.814 --> 20:32.940
about being funny.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.274
Just be open and honest

20:34.316 --> 20:35.985
and everything will

20:34.316 --> 20:35.985
work out just fine.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.028
Are you sure?

20:37.070 --> 20:39.113
Of course, I'm sure.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.573
Well, then again,

20:39.155 --> 20:40.573
I was sure

20:40.614 --> 20:42.658
that the Chicken McLiver

20:40.614 --> 20:42.658
was gonna take off.

20:45.452 --> 20:49.207
Alright, my famous

20:45.452 --> 20:49.207
fried chicken. Mmm.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.791
(Jesse)

20:49.248 --> 20:50.791
'That looks good for us.'

20:50.833 --> 20:51.876
Oh, everybody,

20:50.833 --> 20:51.876
look who's here.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.293
- Hi.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.088
Hey, Roxy.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.088
I hope you like chicken.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.423
Oh, I'm a big chicken person.

20:57.464 --> 21:00.009
[laughing]

21:00.051 --> 21:01.510
Big chicken person.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.429
You-you're quick, young lady.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.429
You really are.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.474
Well, I'm glad you guys

21:05.181 --> 21:07.474
are still talkin' to me

21:07.516 --> 21:09.894
after what happened

21:07.516 --> 21:09.894
the other night at the club.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.479
I forget sometimes that

21:09.936 --> 21:12.479
a joke can hurt as much as

21:12.521 --> 21:14.899
slamming your finger

21:12.521 --> 21:14.899
in a car door.

21:14.941 --> 21:15.983
[laughing]

21:16.025 --> 21:17.235
Car door.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.238
That is funny, funny stuff.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.868
I think what Roxy's

21:23.824 --> 21:25.868
trying to say is

21:25.910 --> 21:27.912
that she would never say

21:25.910 --> 21:27.912
anything to hurt anyone

21:27.954 --> 21:29.747
because she knows

21:27.954 --> 21:29.747
how it feels.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.831
It's true.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.041
When I was a little girl

21:32.083 --> 21:33.500
people used to make

21:32.083 --> 21:33.500
fun of my voice.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.378
Other kids used to

21:33.542 --> 21:36.378
call me "Squeaky."

21:36.420 --> 21:37.838
[laughing]

21:37.880 --> 21:40.049
Oh, squeaky. I have to

21:37.880 --> 21:40.049
remember that one.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.343
What is wrong

21:41.717 --> 21:43.343
with you guys?

21:43.385 --> 21:46.472
Nothing. We're just

21:43.385 --> 21:46.472
laughing at squeaky's jokes.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.060
Roxy's not

21:49.267 --> 21:51.060
trying to tell jokes.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.437
She's trying to be

21:51.102 --> 21:53.437
open and honest with you.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.273
I'm sorry.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.108
We thought that

21:55.355 --> 21:57.108
you were being funny.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.944
We were just trying to

21:57.150 --> 21:59.944
show you that we like you.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.155
By laughing at her?

22:02.196 --> 22:04.157
Oh, Joey you made it seem

22:02.196 --> 22:04.157
like the only way

22:04.198 --> 22:05.574
to show Roxy

22:04.198 --> 22:05.574
that we like her

22:05.616 --> 22:07.994
was to laugh at her jokes.

22:08.035 --> 22:11.205
But Joey, you told me

22:08.035 --> 22:11.205
not to tell any jokes.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.373
Roxy, I'm sorry.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.875
When I told you

22:13.415 --> 22:14.875
not to be funny

22:14.917 --> 22:16.877
and to be

22:14.917 --> 22:16.877
open and honest, I..

22:16.919 --> 22:19.046
Well, I thought it would

22:16.919 --> 22:19.046
take the pressure off you

22:19.088 --> 22:20.673
so that you

22:19.088 --> 22:20.673
could be funny.

22:20.714 --> 22:24.343
Joey, what's the big deal

22:20.714 --> 22:24.343
about being funny?

22:24.384 --> 22:25.761
Well, you guys know

22:24.384 --> 22:25.761
when I was a kid

22:25.803 --> 22:27.221
I moved around a lot.

22:27.263 --> 22:30.183
And that was my way to

22:27.263 --> 22:30.183
get people to like me.

22:30.224 --> 22:33.477
Joey, if you never

22:30.224 --> 22:33.477
did your Bullwinkle

22:33.519 --> 22:35.021
or gargled your Kool-Aid

22:35.062 --> 22:37.648
or said another

22:35.062 --> 22:37.648
funny thing your whole life

22:37.690 --> 22:39.692
we would still love you.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.278
- That's right, buddy.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.278
- 'Yeah, Joey.'

22:42.320 --> 22:44.238
Well, thanks, guys.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.990
Well, I haven't said

22:44.280 --> 22:45.990
a funny thing all night.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.284
You guys must be

22:46.032 --> 22:48.284
crazy about me.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.246
I'll tell you what?

22:49.952 --> 22:52.246
Why don't we start over again?

22:52.288 --> 22:54.790
Roxy, these are the guys.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.790
Guys, Roxy.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.834
- Roxy, nice to meet you.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.834
- Hey, Roxy.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.419
Joey's told us absolutely

22:56.876 --> 22:59.419
nothing about you.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.963
Great.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.298
Have some fried food.

23:04.258 --> 23:05.885
No making out at

23:04.258 --> 23:05.885
the dinner table.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.553
Okay. Alright.
