WEBVTT

00:08.014 --> 00:11.959
[beatboxing]
All right. Let's do it.

00:12.034 --> 00:14.152
Tonight we go back
to where it all began

00:14.227 --> 00:18.432
with our brand-new crossing,
Frog City.

00:18.507 --> 00:21.352
- Ohh! He chucks the pizza!
- Wow! That was action!

00:21.361 --> 00:24.872
Six new Froggers attempt
to turn three lives

00:24.947 --> 00:28.312
into a $10,000 Golden Fanny Pack

00:28.321 --> 00:31.912
and a shot
at the $100,000 grand prize.

00:31.921 --> 00:34.312
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:34.387 --> 00:38.632
The greatest arcade game
ever created...

00:38.641 --> 00:39.759
just got super-sized.

00:39.834 --> 00:41.272
- Yes!
- Whoo!

00:41.281 --> 00:42.512
My man!

00:42.587 --> 00:43.872
Who wants s'more of this?

00:43.947 --> 00:45.832
I'm Damon Wayans Jr.,

00:45.907 --> 00:47.792
and this is "Frogger."

00:47.867 --> 00:49.112
- Oh, boy.
- Aah!

00:49.187 --> 00:51.552
Floor is secure, Kyle.
Back to you.

00:51.627 --> 00:54.992
Going right back down
to Damon Wayans Jr.

00:55.067 --> 00:58.472
Do we have anything to say?
Like, what are we doing?

00:58.547 --> 01:00.952
Are we just going
back and forth with each other?

01:00.961 --> 01:03.792
Yes, we are.
Back to you, Damon.

01:03.867 --> 01:06.192
- Back to you.
- No, back to you.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.112
- Back to you.
- Back to you.

01:08.187 --> 01:11.399
- Back to you!
- And back to you. Not it.

01:11.474 --> 01:13.439
Back to you!

01:20.227 --> 01:23.352
What if you could step
inside a huge arcade machine

01:23.427 --> 01:25.912
and play a life-size
classic video game?

01:25.987 --> 01:28.592
Tonight six players
are about to do just that

01:28.667 --> 01:33.439
for the chance to take home
the $10,000 Golden Fanny Pack.

01:33.514 --> 01:35.912
- Storytime, Wayans. You ready?
- Oh, yeah.

01:35.987 --> 01:39.672
I'm gonna set the scene
for Candy Frog Land.

01:39.747 --> 01:43.712
Froggers will start by hopping
between the conveyor belt tracks

01:43.787 --> 01:47.792
to remove all four gumballs
without going out of bounds.

01:47.867 --> 01:49.512
Bouncing over
the giant jawbreakers

01:49.521 --> 01:51.159
will get them to the candy canes

01:51.234 --> 01:53.712
which Froggers can use
to swing to the chocolate bars.

01:53.787 --> 01:56.159
Dodging the licorice,
they'll leap to the s'mores

01:56.234 --> 01:57.899
and plant the candle
on the cupcake

01:57.901 --> 02:01.279
before taking the Licorice
Bridge to the Landing Pad.

02:02.787 --> 02:05.592
Look at that beautiful scene
here. Absolutely gorgeous.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.312
We have the pink, puffy
cumulus clouds.

02:07.387 --> 02:10.112
- There's some precipitation.
- Oh, my gosh.

02:10.187 --> 02:12.752
It's raining candy.

02:12.827 --> 02:14.912
Rainbow sprinkles.

02:14.987 --> 02:17.152
Beautiful.
Each your heart out, Wonka.

02:17.227 --> 02:19.752
I'm not
a big sprinkle fan myself,

02:19.827 --> 02:21.592
but I would stick my tongue out.

02:21.601 --> 02:22.912
Like you're catching snowflakes?

02:22.987 --> 02:25.039
Ah-hah.

02:25.114 --> 02:27.319
And I don't care who sees me.

02:28.387 --> 02:33.472
It's Danny Shoulders
versus former president JFK.

02:33.547 --> 02:36.752
Hi. My name is Danny Curos.
I'm 22 years old,

02:36.827 --> 02:37.992
and I'm
from Long Island, New York.

02:38.067 --> 02:39.312
I just graduated college,

02:39.321 --> 02:40.872
and I have a finance degree.

02:40.947 --> 02:42.752
I'm an all-around great athlete.

02:42.827 --> 02:46.392
It feels like someone just slid
all my attributes up to 100.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.359
Strength, 100.

02:48.434 --> 02:50.912
Speed, 100. Agility, 100.

02:50.987 --> 02:54.752
To my fellow Froggers, there's
no way you're gonna beat me.

02:54.827 --> 02:59.112
Hi. My name is John Kennedy Jr.,
aka JFK.

02:59.187 --> 03:02.872
I'm 33 years old, and I'm
representing Saginaw, Michigan.

03:02.947 --> 03:04.679
[shouting]

03:04.754 --> 03:06.592
I'm a hockey coach,

03:06.667 --> 03:10.072
and I've been around the game
since the age of 4.

03:10.147 --> 03:11.712
All the things
that we do on the ice

03:11.721 --> 03:14.312
is gonna be even easier
in this competition.

03:14.387 --> 03:16.552
So whoever thinks
they can go against me

03:16.627 --> 03:18.839
probably needs to think twice.

03:18.914 --> 03:22.759
Whoo! I'm about to get a sweet
tooth looking at all of this.

03:23.521 --> 03:26.072
JFK played college hockey,

03:26.147 --> 03:28.472
which means
those teeth are not real.

03:28.547 --> 03:31.112
Look at the size
of Danny's shoulders.

03:31.187 --> 03:33.312
Like his shoulders
have shoulders.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.279
He looks like a mom
from the '80s.

03:35.354 --> 03:37.472
- You ready, Frogger 1?
- Of course.

03:37.481 --> 03:38.792
Here we go.

03:38.867 --> 03:40.792
Now, in Frogger,
the rules are simple.

03:40.867 --> 03:42.119
Each Frogger starts
with three lives.

03:42.194 --> 03:43.872
You fall in the water,
you lose a life.

03:43.947 --> 03:46.319
Whoever completes the crossing
with the most lives intact

03:46.394 --> 03:49.832
or gets the furthest,
moves on to the next level.

03:49.907 --> 03:52.312
Danny Shoulders
onto the Candy Conveyor.

03:52.387 --> 03:54.192
Quick work of the red gumball.

03:54.267 --> 03:57.152
Gotta watch their step here.
We gotta get four gumballs down.

03:57.227 --> 03:58.712
This is a good athlete
right here, Wayans.

03:58.787 --> 04:00.872
We know he's in shape.
We know he's confident.

04:00.947 --> 04:03.432
Blue gumball down. One to go.

04:03.507 --> 04:06.032
The crossings are tough.
It's a 7-foot jump every time.

04:06.107 --> 04:08.712
They go 15 feet per second
on that Candy Conveyor.

04:08.787 --> 04:12.872
And there is the final gumball.
He navigated. No problem.

04:12.947 --> 04:15.352
All day! Can't faze me.

04:15.427 --> 04:18.072
The hair. The shoulders.
Confidence.

04:18.147 --> 04:19.832
Talking crap. I like this guy.

04:19.907 --> 04:22.479
Decision-making time.
Does he go jawbreaker or lily?

04:22.554 --> 04:24.512
Here we go. Lily pad.

04:24.587 --> 04:26.152
Slipped, but he landed.

04:26.227 --> 04:28.912
I think he was padded
by those massive shoulders.

04:28.987 --> 04:30.992
I do not believe
those are his real shoulders.

04:31.067 --> 04:32.392
Right.
I think he's had implants.

04:32.467 --> 04:33.712
I have receipts.

04:33.787 --> 04:35.232
- You have receipts.
- No, I don't.

04:35.307 --> 04:37.032
Close one.

04:37.041 --> 04:38.912
I'll bet
the heart rate's going now.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.312
All right, let's get it.

04:40.387 --> 04:42.312
Over to those
Candy Cane Monkey Bars.

04:42.387 --> 04:44.279
Look at that
immaculate blow dry.

04:44.354 --> 04:45.792
Gorgeous.

04:45.867 --> 04:48.312
He may actually tear down
the Candy Cane Monkey Bars.

04:48.387 --> 04:50.712
They may break.
Drops down to the red lily pad

04:50.787 --> 04:53.472
which will set off
the Cricket Crunch Candy Bars

04:53.547 --> 04:54.912
and the s'mores.

04:54.987 --> 04:57.919
I'm betting Danny
wishes it was a protein bar.

04:59.187 --> 05:02.512
- Danny is focused.
- He still has to survive

05:02.521 --> 05:04.792
that transfer
at the Cricket Crunch Bars,

05:04.867 --> 05:06.832
leap to the s'mores,

05:06.841 --> 05:08.552
plant the candle in the cupcake

05:08.627 --> 05:12.719
before crossing that Licorice
Bridge to the Donut Landing Pad.

05:13.507 --> 05:16.312
Look at this. He straddles
the Licorice Bridge.

05:16.387 --> 05:19.392
- What do you think?
- Take a break, have a drink.

05:19.467 --> 05:21.119
Sure.

05:22.587 --> 05:24.112
And done!

05:24.187 --> 05:27.552
Done, done, done!
Down goes Danny.

05:27.627 --> 05:28.592
[laughs]

05:28.667 --> 05:30.952
Sugar-free. Not tonight.

05:31.027 --> 05:33.039
Ooh. Tough go.

05:33.114 --> 05:36.072
Danny had a sloppy fall
off the Licorice.

05:36.147 --> 05:39.719
Look at this replay.
He tried to land with his foot.

05:39.794 --> 05:41.239
- Can't do it.
- Do you think

05:41.314 --> 05:43.992
he can just use the shoulders
as giant forceps?

05:44.067 --> 05:47.512
Ohh! And he would just squish
the Cricket Crunch.

05:47.587 --> 05:51.312
- Are you ready, Frogger 2?
- Born ready.

05:51.387 --> 05:53.079
Here we go.

05:58.507 --> 06:02.159
And here is
John F. Kennedy. Speed.

06:02.234 --> 06:04.272
He's got one of four gumballs.

06:04.347 --> 06:05.919
He can leap, too.

06:05.994 --> 06:08.999
This is a blessed athlete,
a hockey guy, hockey coach.

06:09.074 --> 06:11.952
And--Oh, that was awkward.
Saved himself.

06:12.027 --> 06:13.512
Great recovery.

06:13.587 --> 06:16.032
John F. Kennedy knocks off
the yellow gumball.

06:16.107 --> 06:18.952
Jumping seems to be no problem
over that 7-foot gap.

06:19.027 --> 06:21.152
Good performance so far
by the former president.

06:21.227 --> 06:24.992
Danny talked a big game
about his speed and his agility,

06:25.067 --> 06:27.792
but JFK has come out
like a train.

06:27.867 --> 06:30.592
Another 7-foot jump.
And here we go.

06:30.667 --> 06:32.392
Nice jump.

06:32.467 --> 06:33.752
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:33.827 --> 06:36.152
we have ourselves
a Frogger competition.

06:36.227 --> 06:38.512
He is flying through this. Wow!

06:38.587 --> 06:42.712
Monkey Bar Candy Canes.
Let's go, JFK.

06:42.787 --> 06:46.112
Ask not what
your candy can do for you

06:46.187 --> 06:48.352
but what you can do
for your candy.

06:48.427 --> 06:50.712
Here we go.
Onto the Cricket Crunch.

06:50.787 --> 06:51.912
Let's go!

06:51.987 --> 06:53.632
Ooh!

06:53.707 --> 06:55.752
The nature boy.

06:55.827 --> 06:57.232
Ooh!

06:57.241 --> 06:59.712
Look at this guy.
Good dancing. Oh, yeah.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.912
All right.

07:01.987 --> 07:04.672
Okay, we got something here.

07:04.747 --> 07:08.392
The former president has made it
to the Cricket Crunches.

07:08.401 --> 07:09.832
He has tied Danny.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.312
Come on. Get closer.

07:11.387 --> 07:14.392
Can he solve the puzzle
to take the lead?

07:14.467 --> 07:16.552
- Here he goes.
- What a jump!

07:16.627 --> 07:19.912
- Yes! We're alive and well.
- All right!

07:19.987 --> 07:21.872
How does he do it?

07:21.881 --> 07:24.312
Gets to here,
JFK takes the lead.

07:24.387 --> 07:26.832
He makes another jump.
Now the s'mores.

07:26.907 --> 07:28.752
How you doing over there?

07:28.827 --> 07:30.872
Tension, animosity
on Candy Frog Land

07:30.947 --> 07:32.432
between these two.

07:32.507 --> 07:36.112
- I'll be back soon.
- JFK is destroying this course.

07:36.121 --> 07:37.439
I like it on this side.

07:37.514 --> 07:40.072
If he finishes,
this battle is over.

07:40.147 --> 07:43.712
Who wants s'more of this?
Who wants s'more of this?

07:43.787 --> 07:46.719
Only a few more jumps to the end
and an automatic win.

07:46.794 --> 07:49.952
But ahead of him now
is one of the trickiest jumps

07:50.027 --> 07:52.352
on this crossing--
the Spinning S'mores.

07:52.427 --> 07:53.519
Come on. Fall.

07:53.594 --> 07:54.992
Take your time.

07:55.067 --> 07:57.919
A little bit slippery.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.832
This is one
of the most competitive

08:09.907 --> 08:13.199
Frogger first-life battles
we have seen to date.

08:13.274 --> 08:15.592
JFK versus Danny Shoulders

08:15.667 --> 08:19.392
is shaping up as a real contest
here in Candy Frog Land.

08:19.467 --> 08:22.112
Just take a breath, buddy.
You got this.

08:22.187 --> 08:23.759
A little bit slippery.

08:24.401 --> 08:28.392
- Aah!
- And down goes JFK!

08:28.467 --> 08:30.912
Couldn't handle
the Spinning S'mores.

08:30.987 --> 08:33.919
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

08:33.994 --> 08:35.392
You gotta go further than that.

08:35.467 --> 08:37.032
You gotta get higher.
You gotta go harder.

08:37.107 --> 08:39.192
Lot of leg weight.
I'm a big leg guy.

08:39.267 --> 08:41.392
Well, you have a torso
of a 4-foot-2 man,

08:41.467 --> 08:42.832
but the legs
of Wilt Chamberlain.

08:42.907 --> 08:44.432
My belly button's right here.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.552
Danny from Long Island.
The Cricket Crunch is off.

08:47.627 --> 08:49.672
Second life,
a more conventional approach.

08:49.747 --> 08:51.592
And look how easy that was.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.032
Don't psych yourself out.

08:53.107 --> 08:55.592
Onto the Oscillating S'more.
We got momentum.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.112
Stay hot. He's got the hot hand.

08:57.187 --> 08:59.592
He is Steph Curry in the corner.
Get him the ball.

08:59.667 --> 09:03.279
Can he stay up?
It's so hard. He's down.

09:04.707 --> 09:05.952
Danny got cooled off.

09:06.027 --> 09:08.272
He did. He got cooled off fast.

09:08.347 --> 09:11.272
Done in by a s'more.
That's why you watch, folks.

09:11.281 --> 09:13.232
He fell here.
Came up well short

09:13.307 --> 09:15.279
for the Spinning S'more
last time.

09:15.354 --> 09:16.672
Oh, no!

09:16.747 --> 09:18.552
Down he goes again.

09:18.627 --> 09:19.992
This is a slugfest,

09:20.067 --> 09:22.439
exchanging blows
in the center of the ring.

09:22.514 --> 09:25.072
[in slo-mo]
Let's go. Let's go.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.592
And Danny, bro, is so fired up.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.352
Dude, his shoulders
got bigger.

09:29.427 --> 09:31.272
They got bigger between lives.

09:31.347 --> 09:34.959
Danny Shoulders.
His third and final life.

09:35.034 --> 09:36.599
190 pounds,

09:36.674 --> 09:39.432
with 90 of those pounds
being in his deltoid muscles.

09:39.507 --> 09:42.352
He's got a pump going
and he is ready to go.

09:42.361 --> 09:46.392
Ladies and gentlemen,
to your feet, and he is on it.

09:46.467 --> 09:48.232
- Nice.
- Oh, that was beautiful.

09:48.307 --> 09:50.512
Game time. This is
when I win it right here.

09:50.521 --> 09:52.672
Talk that talk, son.

09:52.747 --> 09:55.832
Danny from Long Island
takes the lead.

09:55.907 --> 09:57.832
On to the cupcakes.

09:57.907 --> 10:01.112
It's an 8 1/2-foot leap.

10:01.187 --> 10:04.632
The biggest on the course,
and here he goes.

10:04.707 --> 10:06.352
He's off. No, no. He's fallen.

10:06.361 --> 10:08.672
- Can he keep himself up?
- Get up, Danny.

10:08.681 --> 10:10.992
- Get that leg up.
- Wow!

10:11.067 --> 10:12.792
An incredible display
of strength!

10:12.867 --> 10:14.512
Danny's alive!

10:14.587 --> 10:17.032
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my God.

10:17.041 --> 10:18.472
I thought he was done.

10:18.547 --> 10:20.592
Right here
I'm like, "It's over."

10:20.667 --> 10:22.272
One arm. One tricep.

10:22.347 --> 10:24.039
Those shoulders just saved
his life on this show.

10:24.114 --> 10:25.552
He's a beast, man.

10:25.561 --> 10:28.839
Put that birthday candle
on the top of the cake

10:28.914 --> 10:30.872
and then deal
with the Licorice Bridge.

10:30.947 --> 10:33.912
- I can hurdle over it.
- Can this Frogger finish?

10:33.921 --> 10:38.632
Foot after foot on the Licorice.
It's slippery and it's narrow.

10:38.707 --> 10:40.472
My gosh.
My heart's in my throat.

10:40.547 --> 10:43.632
And down he goes.
Down goes Danny.

10:43.707 --> 10:46.912
Hats off to this young man.
I need a hat.

10:46.921 --> 10:49.072
- Give Damon a hat, please.
- So I can take it off.

10:49.081 --> 10:50.912
So he can take it off.

10:50.987 --> 10:52.352
Ready, Frogger 2?

10:52.427 --> 10:54.632
Absolutely.
Let's get it roasting.

10:54.707 --> 10:56.352
Here we go.

10:56.427 --> 11:00.512
John F. Kennedy.
His third and final life.

11:00.521 --> 11:03.119
Will he light fire
to the s'mores?

11:05.594 --> 11:08.032
And he's up. He's got it!
He's got it!

11:08.107 --> 11:09.312
Here we go, baby!

11:09.387 --> 11:11.392
- Ohh!
- Way to stick it, man.

11:11.401 --> 11:15.992
Ladies and gentlemen,
this could be a $10,000 leap.

11:16.067 --> 11:17.712
- Yeah!
- Oh, no!

11:17.721 --> 11:20.672
Down goes JFK.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.512
And it is over.

11:22.587 --> 11:25.119
Oh, thank you so much.
Thank you.

11:25.194 --> 11:26.512
Look at Danny.

11:26.587 --> 11:28.752
Have a moment, Danny.
You've earned it.

11:28.827 --> 11:30.159
That was massive.

11:30.234 --> 11:32.672
The young buck
from Long Island, New York.

11:32.747 --> 11:35.192
Call me Dame D.O.L.L.A.
Dame D.O.L.L.A.

11:35.267 --> 11:37.072
Your boy is clutch.

11:37.147 --> 11:39.719
Can we give JFK
another shot at this thing?

11:39.794 --> 11:43.479
Please. He just said,
"Call me Dame D.O.L.L.A."

11:43.554 --> 11:47.792
Danny, you are moving
to the Boss Toad Bonus Round.

11:47.867 --> 11:49.712
Way to play the game, my friend.

11:49.721 --> 11:52.319
Awesome. Thank you.
Long Island, stand up.

11:52.394 --> 11:53.952
So who's crossing is up next?

11:53.961 --> 11:55.719
Everybody, look both ways

11:55.794 --> 11:58.312
because we are in Frog City.

11:58.321 --> 12:02.272
We're transporting you straight
back to the original game.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.432
Hoppers Highway
is the first obstacle

12:04.507 --> 12:06.872
as Froggers try
to hit the crosswalk button

12:06.947 --> 12:09.959
so they can cross the bridge
and get past the truck.

12:10.034 --> 12:12.672
After sneaking along
the wall of the factory,

12:12.681 --> 12:15.032
they'll order a pizza,
which they'll collect

12:15.107 --> 12:16.792
by dodging the spinning cars

12:16.867 --> 12:18.719
and slipping past
the ramming vans

12:18.794 --> 12:21.992
before they negotiate the cabs
to the Landing Pad,

12:22.067 --> 12:23.632
pizza in hand.

12:23.707 --> 12:27.312
But watch out. The traffic here
can be a nightmare.

12:27.387 --> 12:30.352
The Fast and the Froggiest.

12:30.361 --> 12:32.799
With less than a second
to make each jump,

12:32.874 --> 12:35.159
it's about speed and accuracy.

12:35.234 --> 12:38.472
And the Jean Claude Ram Vans.

12:38.547 --> 12:41.872
Each 4-foot-wide van
packs over 200 pounds

12:41.947 --> 12:43.912
of pushing power.

12:43.921 --> 12:46.312
A match for the ages.

12:46.321 --> 12:48.592
We've got Matt versus Marley.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.439
This one's gonna be good.

12:51.867 --> 12:53.552
I'm Marley. I'm 26 years old.

12:53.627 --> 12:56.632
I live in Henderson, Nevada,
and I'm a professional acrobat.

12:56.707 --> 12:59.312
I mean, my whole life
is really the circus.

12:59.321 --> 13:01.912
I jump up and down for a living.

13:01.987 --> 13:04.792
I'm essentially a real lifer.

13:04.801 --> 13:06.359
This is my jam.

13:06.434 --> 13:09.512
I'm ready for anything
you guys have to throw at me.

13:09.587 --> 13:11.239
Frogger is my game.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.272
I'm Matt Collins,
34 years old,

13:15.347 --> 13:18.512
from Doylestown, Ohio,
and I'm a leadership consultant.

13:18.587 --> 13:20.192
I think I can win Frogger

13:20.267 --> 13:22.992
because I have a lot
of different talents

13:23.067 --> 13:24.759
when it comes to athletics.

13:24.834 --> 13:27.352
I do rock climbing,
so I have good body control.

13:27.427 --> 13:29.992
I play tennis,
so I have cardio and fitness.

13:30.067 --> 13:32.992
I've done softball
and badminton,

13:33.067 --> 13:34.672
so my coordination is there.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.392
I'm the most competitive one
out there.

13:36.467 --> 13:40.392
I will do whatever it takes
to get this.

13:40.467 --> 13:43.072
I'm already trying to figure out
my timings right now.

13:43.147 --> 13:44.392
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

13:44.467 --> 13:47.392
- Ready, Frogger 1?
- I'm ready.

13:47.467 --> 13:50.279
Here we go.
All right, Cleveland, Ohio,

13:50.354 --> 13:54.592
we all are witnesses
to native son Matt Collins,

13:54.601 --> 13:58.312
attempting now to join us
on Hoppers Highway,

13:58.387 --> 14:01.112
a terrifying
pothole-laden freeway.

14:01.187 --> 14:04.192
We have no idea which way
this round is going to go.

14:04.201 --> 14:05.712
One is an acrobat.

14:05.721 --> 14:08.592
The other does
every sport on the planet.

14:08.601 --> 14:10.079
There goes the crosswalk button.

14:10.154 --> 14:12.792
Now you gotta get over
to the Croaklyn Bridge,

14:12.867 --> 14:14.592
5 1/2 feet wide, 12 feet long.

14:14.667 --> 14:17.672
Not built to code.
Take your chances as you jump.

14:17.747 --> 14:19.632
And he's on it! Okay.

14:19.707 --> 14:21.632
Thunder Truck moves now, though.

14:21.707 --> 14:25.032
I am on the edge of my seat,
literally.

14:25.107 --> 14:28.072
- It's not comfortable.
- [laughs]

14:28.081 --> 14:31.672
A massive vehicle
with no regard for pedestrians.

14:31.747 --> 14:34.592
And he makes a run for it.
And he's good.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.832
Wow. He made it look easy.

14:36.841 --> 14:38.672
- He did.
- He made it look really easy.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.392
Now it's pizza time.

14:40.467 --> 14:42.032
But you're gonna have
to get around

14:42.107 --> 14:43.672
the far side of the warehouse.

14:43.747 --> 14:46.672
Only the very tips of his toes
on the one-inch ledge.

14:46.681 --> 14:49.272
What I do love is that
he's not stepping on my flowers.

14:49.347 --> 14:50.592
[ringing]

14:50.667 --> 14:53.472
Good evening. Pizza Rana.
Can I take your order?

14:53.547 --> 14:55.872
Just a large order
of flies, please.

14:55.947 --> 14:58.992
- Large order of flies?
- Large flies. Hold the salt.

14:59.067 --> 15:00.712
We're all out of everything.

15:00.721 --> 15:02.592
We got pepperoni if that works.
Does that work?

15:02.667 --> 15:04.192
I am a little disappointed.

15:04.267 --> 15:06.232
<i> You know what?</i>
<i> I'm doing what I can here.</i>

15:06.307 --> 15:09.192
You can pick yours up
on the van. The green one.

15:09.267 --> 15:12.312
Zero percent approval rating
on Pizza Rana, as always.

15:12.387 --> 15:15.592
Oh ho ho ho!

15:15.667 --> 15:16.872
Oh, boy.

15:16.947 --> 15:18.632
And now we get real serious,

15:18.707 --> 15:21.392
'cause looming in front of him
is the Fast and the Froggiest.

15:21.467 --> 15:24.352
Look at these cars
spinning at 15 feet per second.

15:24.427 --> 15:26.032
Wayans, break this down quickly
before he jumps.

15:26.107 --> 15:27.399
Too late. Wow!

15:27.474 --> 15:29.392
This guy's moving
way too fast for that.

15:29.401 --> 15:32.919
- Oh, my gosh, this dude.
- Matt Collins is on fire.

15:34.227 --> 15:36.832
He is a speed demon right now.

15:36.907 --> 15:39.712
Absolutely. Excellent.
This is Peter Parker-esque.

15:39.721 --> 15:42.192
- That's a hell of a beard.
- Hell of a beard.

15:42.267 --> 15:44.672
You see the pizza on top
of our own van,

15:44.747 --> 15:46.232
the green one in the middle.

15:46.307 --> 15:49.112
Will the vans be his undoing?

15:49.187 --> 15:52.192
Gotta grab that pizza.
Gotta get to the taxicab

15:52.201 --> 15:55.032
and eventually home
to the Landing Pad.

15:55.107 --> 15:57.392
Matt, grab the pizza.

15:57.401 --> 15:58.559
Go. Go.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.832
- Uh-oh. No pizza.
- No pizza.

16:02.907 --> 16:06.352
You gotta backtrack. You cannot
finish without the pizza.

16:06.361 --> 16:07.919
Can he do it?

16:20.547 --> 16:22.272
- No pizza.
- No pizza.

16:22.347 --> 16:24.432
- I need the pizza!
- This is incredible.

16:24.507 --> 16:27.719
Matt's made it past
the Jean Claude Ram Vans,

16:27.794 --> 16:29.952
but he left the pizza.

16:30.027 --> 16:31.392
So, again, you gotta backtrack.

16:31.467 --> 16:33.072
You cannot finish
without the pizza.

16:33.147 --> 16:35.152
This is a much higher degree
of difficulty.

16:35.227 --> 16:36.792
This is effectively
a shuttle run

16:36.801 --> 16:39.152
that you would do in gym class
or the combine

16:39.227 --> 16:40.792
instead of a straight run.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.719
I don't know if this is doable.
I'm praying for him.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.752
- Here we go.
- Ohh!

16:44.827 --> 16:49.072
Prayers have not been answered.
Down goes Frogger.

16:49.147 --> 16:50.759
This is the pizza.
If it stays alive,

16:50.834 --> 16:53.159
knows that he can't advance
to the taxicabs

16:53.234 --> 16:54.759
without that fresh pizza pie
you made him.

16:54.834 --> 16:57.832
So he goes back.
He's gotta grab it and go back.

16:57.907 --> 17:00.072
Doubtful that we will see
another one of these

17:00.147 --> 17:01.912
that forgets the pizza.

17:01.987 --> 17:04.272
That was
your classic side attack.

17:04.281 --> 17:07.472
"Jurassic Park." "Clever girl."
Right from the side.

17:07.547 --> 17:09.832
Bam! Velociraptor
ripped his face off.

17:09.907 --> 17:11.639
"He left us!"

17:11.714 --> 17:13.272
Marley Webster.

17:13.347 --> 17:15.239
All the way at the top
of the draft boards.

17:15.314 --> 17:16.672
Everyone's got their eye
on him.

17:16.747 --> 17:19.592
Professional acrobat.
Great athlete.

17:19.667 --> 17:21.512
I'm looking forward to seeing
how he plays this.

17:21.587 --> 17:24.112
I hope he doesn't disappoint.
I've been disappointed before.

17:24.187 --> 17:26.672
Marley, we got
big expectations, buddy.

17:26.747 --> 17:29.072
A lot of people are taking you
number 1 overall.

17:29.147 --> 17:31.192
Wayans is crying harder
over Marley

17:31.267 --> 17:32.912
than my wife cried
over "Marley & Me,"

17:32.987 --> 17:34.479
and that's no small task.

17:36.027 --> 17:37.352
- This seems fun.
- All right, brother.

17:37.427 --> 17:40.839
- M-M-M-M-M-Marley.
- Hey yo!

17:40.914 --> 17:43.512
- Ready, Frogger 2?
- Ready.

17:43.587 --> 17:46.352
- Here we go.
- Let's go. All right, Marley.

17:46.427 --> 17:49.392
All right, Marley Webster
goes on the Hoppers Highway.

17:49.467 --> 17:51.112
- Too easy.
- So calm.

17:51.187 --> 17:54.599
Now he's got the 7-foot jump
across the middle of it.

17:54.674 --> 17:58.279
Gotta make it over
to the crosswalk button, folks.

17:59.441 --> 18:02.072
He has activated
the Croaklyn Bridge.

18:02.147 --> 18:05.512
Gotta get back
across another 7-foot jump.

18:05.587 --> 18:07.119
I could've danced
my way through.

18:07.194 --> 18:10.032
Smooth operator.
Smooth as silk.

18:10.107 --> 18:11.432
Marley has a man bun.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.079
Even if he didn't have
a man bun,

18:13.154 --> 18:15.072
he'd give off man-bun vibes.

18:15.147 --> 18:17.832
- No doubt.
- Yeah.

18:17.907 --> 18:20.432
I steps onto Croaklyn Bridge.

18:20.507 --> 18:22.912
And then there's
a 2,000-pound truck

18:22.987 --> 18:24.232
that's gonna hit you
in the face.

18:24.307 --> 18:26.672
Now it's just Marley and me.
And you.

18:26.747 --> 18:30.272
Got a great chance right here.
He's got it. Smooth.

18:30.347 --> 18:32.279
What a run
as he rounds the corner.

18:32.354 --> 18:34.472
Now it's pizza time.
See, the combination there

18:34.547 --> 18:37.192
of being a professional acrobat
and he's a daily meditator,

18:37.267 --> 18:39.872
a practicing Buddhist,
he has this calm to him.

18:39.947 --> 18:42.072
This man is a juggernaut.

18:42.147 --> 18:43.799
And yet he still likes
that pizza.

18:43.874 --> 18:46.192
Can we please have
one satisfied customer?

18:46.201 --> 18:48.192
We're gonna go
out of business soon.

18:48.267 --> 18:49.672
- [ringing]
- Good evening.

18:49.747 --> 18:51.272
<i> - Howdy, howdy.</i>
- Pizza Rana. What's your order?

18:51.347 --> 18:53.192
I'll take a pepperoni.

18:53.267 --> 18:56.559
You can pick it up
at the van in the middle.

18:56.634 --> 18:58.712
<i> - See you soon.</i>
- Thank you.

18:58.787 --> 19:00.192
Bye-bye.

19:00.267 --> 19:02.039
God, I'm so good at it.

19:02.114 --> 19:03.632
You're getting better.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.872
Employee of the Month.
Frame thing, you know.

19:05.947 --> 19:08.672
Totally relaxed.
He has the body language

19:08.747 --> 19:10.599
of someone tying their shoes
on the couch.

19:10.674 --> 19:13.032
This is really calm.

19:13.107 --> 19:15.719
Welcome to
the Fast and the Froggiest,

19:15.794 --> 19:17.152
emphasis on the fast.

19:17.227 --> 19:19.152
So those are wet,
and I gotta be so quick.

19:19.227 --> 19:22.872
These three cars whipping around
15 feet per second.

19:22.947 --> 19:24.392
Here we go.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.352
He's put the pressure on,
and here he comes. Yes!

19:27.427 --> 19:29.472
Oh.

19:29.547 --> 19:31.912
Oh, now it's the pizza part?
Okay.

19:31.987 --> 19:33.352
Well, here we go.

19:33.427 --> 19:36.272
Jean Claude Ram Van,
with a pizza on the top.

19:36.347 --> 19:38.232
This is the spot.
This is the spot.

19:38.307 --> 19:41.272
And we have a tie.
We officially have a tie

19:41.281 --> 19:43.232
which he can break
if he crosses the vans, Wayans.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.952
It goes in and it comes back.
It goes in and it goes...

19:46.027 --> 19:48.312
Blue. Green. Pink.
Take your pick.

19:48.387 --> 19:49.839
Just take your pizza.

19:49.914 --> 19:51.792
- Don't be scared.
- Whoo! I'm a little nervous.

19:51.867 --> 19:53.272
Don't be scared!

19:53.347 --> 19:55.072
He's a slim guy,
so he's got a chance.

19:55.081 --> 19:57.032
I don't think
he eats much pizza.

19:57.107 --> 19:58.072
Maybe there's gonna be
an unfamiliarity

19:58.147 --> 19:59.592
that comes into play.

19:59.667 --> 20:03.392
Looks more of a rice cake
and protein type guy.

20:03.467 --> 20:05.472
And...

20:05.547 --> 20:06.992
down!

20:07.067 --> 20:09.072
Pizza like a discus.

20:09.147 --> 20:11.312
- Wow. That was action.
- Oh, man.

20:11.387 --> 20:13.472
- Oh, my goodness.
- Good effort, buddy!

20:13.547 --> 20:15.032
That was wild.
We gotta see this,

20:15.107 --> 20:17.472
'cause we had
a pure wet/pizza toss

20:17.547 --> 20:18.799
and a big splash.

20:18.874 --> 20:20.472
- I like the grab.
- I do, too.

20:20.547 --> 20:23.192
- Whoa, the spin...
- Watch the pizza.

20:23.201 --> 20:26.472
The toss, fantastic.
[laughs]

20:26.547 --> 20:28.312
This dude is playing
a game of Frisbee

20:28.387 --> 20:29.912
in the middle of
the crossing.

20:29.987 --> 20:31.432
Amazing.

20:31.507 --> 20:33.592
All right, each Frogger
has spent one life,

20:33.667 --> 20:35.912
which means Matt Collins,
on life number two,

20:35.987 --> 20:37.919
will attempt to break a tie.

20:38.787 --> 20:40.592
That's right up on the edge.

20:40.601 --> 20:41.879
Gotta grab that pizza.

20:41.954 --> 20:44.592
Hop a couple of cabs
and hey, presto!

20:44.667 --> 20:45.672
You're home.

20:45.747 --> 20:46.712
Let's go, Matt.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.025
Go...now.

20:48.101 --> 20:49.952
Now! Right now!
You missed it!

20:49.961 --> 20:51.959
Marley's really trying
to distract him.

20:52.034 --> 20:53.912
Constant talking from Marley.

20:53.987 --> 20:56.352
Marley, I'm concentrating.

20:56.427 --> 20:58.112
It's a classic
video game trope.

20:58.187 --> 20:59.592
Any of these
old '80s video games,

20:59.667 --> 21:01.312
you gotta find that pattern
that works right.

21:01.387 --> 21:03.072
It's all about patterns.
It seems to be

21:03.147 --> 21:04.272
- that Matt is memorizing it.
- As soon as you take that step.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.519
Let's hope for his sake--

21:05.594 --> 21:07.592
I think Matt needs
to look down

21:07.667 --> 21:10.039
- more than look at the pizza.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

21:12.114 --> 21:13.792
Now just get past the pink
and get to the cab.

21:13.867 --> 21:15.192
Oh! No.

21:15.267 --> 21:17.472
- Oh, you!
- And the pink one depleted him!

21:17.547 --> 21:19.192
Down goes Frogger.

21:19.267 --> 21:21.679
He's in the water!

21:22.747 --> 21:24.792
You cannot hesitate
in Frog City.

21:24.801 --> 21:27.752
I've said that once,
and I'll say it again.

21:27.827 --> 21:29.672
He was after his Rana Pizza

21:29.747 --> 21:32.032
and he got...
[trills R] ran over.

21:32.107 --> 21:33.319
Well, there's the crickets.

21:34.227 --> 21:36.632
Marley Webster,
professional acrobat

21:36.707 --> 21:39.599
from the state of Nevada.
He's on his second life.

21:43.627 --> 21:46.232
If he crosses this course,
it is over.

21:46.307 --> 21:47.519
Don't mess it up now.

21:47.594 --> 21:49.792
He's off, he's got it.
He advances!

21:49.867 --> 21:51.399
He's got it!
He's got it!

21:51.474 --> 21:54.152
Marley Webster
is two bounds away

21:54.227 --> 21:56.319
from finishing this thing,
Wayans.

21:59.667 --> 22:00.952
No!

22:01.027 --> 22:03.352
And Marley Webster,
the legend!

22:03.427 --> 22:06.072
Every little thing's
gonna be all right!

22:06.147 --> 22:08.552
- Well done, Marley!
- Have some pizza!

22:08.627 --> 22:09.672
[Matt laughs]

22:09.747 --> 22:11.752
Frog City is conquered.

22:11.761 --> 22:13.952
Way to play Frogger, Marley.

22:14.027 --> 22:15.992
Marley Webster is for real.

22:16.067 --> 22:18.152
We hyped him,
we talked him up,

22:18.227 --> 22:20.919
and now he's standing
in a pile of confetti.

22:22.914 --> 22:24.872
Congratulations to Marley.

22:24.947 --> 22:26.512
He will join Danny Shoulders

22:26.587 --> 22:28.312
and the winner
of our next crossing

22:28.387 --> 22:30.672
in the Boss Toad Bonus Round,

22:30.747 --> 22:34.192
the world championship
of the "Frogger" universe,

22:34.267 --> 22:37.359
for a chance to win
that Golden Fanny Pack.

22:39.881 --> 22:42.032
Yeah, I love it.

22:42.107 --> 22:43.912
Even Tom Brady
doesn't have one of these.

22:43.987 --> 22:47.872
Tom Brady has 71
championship rings

22:47.947 --> 22:50.032
and not one Golden Fanny Pack.

22:50.041 --> 22:51.479
Not one.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.952
Now, drink up, me hearties.

23:04.027 --> 23:07.152
Let's set sail for...

23:07.161 --> 23:09.392
After swinging
to the Jolly Frogger,

23:09.467 --> 23:10.912
Froggers will have to
walk the planks,

23:10.921 --> 23:13.752
climb the cargo net,
and fetch a cracker.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.792
Crossing back across the deck,
they'll catch a ride

23:15.867 --> 23:17.792
with Polly the Parrot
to the Desert Island.

23:17.867 --> 23:20.119
Then they'll need
to get over the rocks,

23:20.194 --> 23:22.359
past the skull,
and over the gators.

23:23.834 --> 23:25.512
Pelted by water cannons,

23:25.587 --> 23:27.279
they'll make their way
across the lilies

23:27.354 --> 23:30.952
and finally to the spinning X
which marks the spot

23:31.027 --> 23:32.992
for their final leap
to the treasure.

23:33.067 --> 23:34.352
- Hey, Kyle.
- Yeah?

23:34.427 --> 23:37.232
"Arr" you excited
for Frog Skull Island?

23:37.307 --> 23:38.952
Is this what we're gonna be,
as a show?

23:39.027 --> 23:40.552
We're just gonna sit around
and make lame pirate jokes?

23:40.627 --> 23:41.952
- That's us?
- Come on, man, I don't wanna

23:42.027 --> 23:43.152
"arr"-gue with you right now.

23:43.227 --> 23:45.552
Why did I take this job?
Honestly?

23:45.627 --> 23:46.992
I don't know.
Maybe you should have been

23:47.067 --> 23:48.672
a pirate's favorite
profession.

23:48.747 --> 23:50.392
Really, Damon? What's
a pirate's favorite profession?

23:50.467 --> 23:52.719
- An "arr"-chitect!
- I think we're done.

23:54.914 --> 23:57.199
This is the big time.

23:57.274 --> 24:01.552
Retro nerd Ash versus
flight attendant Katherine.

24:01.627 --> 24:04.752
Hi, my name is Ash.
I'm 35 years old.

24:04.827 --> 24:08.072
I'm from Georgia, and I am
a visual and graphic designer.

24:08.147 --> 24:11.152
I really love the joy
of retro gaming.

24:11.161 --> 24:13.552
What's not good
about retro games?

24:13.561 --> 24:16.552
Oh, my gosh. Like, retro games
don't hold your hand.

24:16.627 --> 24:19.319
The struggle that you go
through trying to beat a level,

24:19.394 --> 24:22.039
beat a game, it's so fun.

24:23.161 --> 24:24.712
To be the ultimate Frogger,

24:24.721 --> 24:27.912
like, that--
that's goals right now.

24:27.987 --> 24:30.559
My name's Kat.
I'm from Cannon Beach, Oregon.

24:30.634 --> 24:33.712
I'm 28 years old,
and I'm a flight attendant.

24:33.721 --> 24:36.719
I love all things
to do with adrenaline.

24:36.794 --> 24:39.192
I did four backflips
out of an airplane.

24:39.267 --> 24:40.872
Love snowboarding.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.552
Try to surf as big of waves
as possible.

24:43.561 --> 24:45.312
It'll be fun.

24:45.387 --> 24:46.832
This one has it all.

24:46.907 --> 24:49.952
This is shaping up to be
the match of the century--

24:50.027 --> 24:52.519
Ash versus Katherine.

24:53.587 --> 24:56.919
Ready, Frogger One?
Here we go!

24:57.827 --> 25:02.479
First up, Ash McIntosh
with an 11-1/2 foot rope swing.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.459
Here she goes.

25:09.027 --> 25:11.512
- Whoa!
- No, and down she goes.

25:11.521 --> 25:13.552
These eyes have nev--
are you kidding me?

25:13.627 --> 25:14.512
Oh, my God!

25:14.587 --> 25:17.679
Are you froggin' kidding me?

25:18.587 --> 25:21.592
Ash, I love ya, girl.
What happened?

25:21.667 --> 25:23.352
[laughter]

25:23.427 --> 25:25.432
That's Damon Wayans, Jr's
commentary.

25:25.507 --> 25:27.872
Just a belly laugh like
a 6-year-old,

25:27.881 --> 25:28.992
and I can't blame him.

25:29.067 --> 25:30.519
You got it, girl!

25:30.594 --> 25:32.672
And the girl in the background's
like "You got it, girl!"

25:32.747 --> 25:35.152
[Damon laughs loudly]

25:35.227 --> 25:36.552
She beat gravity.

25:36.627 --> 25:39.359
That is what "Frogger"
is all about.

25:40.307 --> 25:42.239
- Ready, Frogger Two?
- Yeah.

25:42.314 --> 25:43.352
Here we go!

25:43.427 --> 25:44.792
Kat the flight attendant,

25:44.867 --> 25:46.592
you are now free
to move about the crossing.

25:46.667 --> 25:48.719
Let's see if she
can get past Ash.

25:48.794 --> 25:50.112
First order of business.

25:50.187 --> 25:52.952
Off she goes.

25:52.961 --> 25:54.832
Oh, she went back! She's trying
to keep Ash in this.

25:54.841 --> 25:56.352
She misses Ash.

25:56.427 --> 25:58.712
It says that Kat is
a flight attendant

25:58.787 --> 26:00.099
and a skydiver.

26:00.101 --> 26:01.679
Why do I find that unsettling?

26:03.667 --> 26:05.679
Let's do it! Kat!

26:06.667 --> 26:08.279
Oh, love to see it.

26:08.354 --> 26:10.352
She's onto the first plank,
ladies and gentlemen.

26:10.427 --> 26:12.112
Now she's gotta cross
all of them.

26:12.187 --> 26:13.432
- Some of them retract.
- Oh. Oh.

26:13.441 --> 26:14.752
Oh, no. What do we got?

26:14.827 --> 26:16.272
This is the third
of the four planks.

26:16.347 --> 26:17.952
She's got some long legs.
That's good.

26:18.027 --> 26:20.472
It's a dangerous game to be
on the retractable planks.

26:20.547 --> 26:23.312
Cargo net.
We are playing "Frogger"!

26:23.387 --> 26:24.792
She's gotta scale
the cargo net

26:24.867 --> 26:26.992
onto the deck
of the<i> Jolly Frogger,</i>

26:27.067 --> 26:28.432
at which point
she'll probably go

26:28.507 --> 26:30.432
to the barrel of crackers,
don't you think?

26:30.507 --> 26:33.599
Aw, man. I have got
a ways to catch up.

26:33.674 --> 26:35.279
I got the cracker!

26:35.354 --> 26:36.712
No shortcut--
get the cracker

26:36.787 --> 26:38.672
and get across
that<i> Jolly Frogger.</i>

26:38.747 --> 26:40.639
I'm not falling down
this bad boy.

26:40.714 --> 26:42.232
What do you get
the vibe for here, Damon?

26:42.307 --> 26:43.872
What do you think of this?

26:43.947 --> 26:46.312
Uh, I think she's gonna
at least get to the parrot?

26:46.387 --> 26:47.952
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

26:48.027 --> 26:50.752
She's arrived at the parrot.

26:50.827 --> 26:52.552
What a visionary you are.

26:52.627 --> 26:54.672
- [Damon snickers]
- Polly!

26:54.747 --> 26:56.072
Got a cracker!

26:56.147 --> 26:58.512
That looks really, really,
really high.

26:58.587 --> 27:00.952
- I got this.
- Polly takes off,

27:01.027 --> 27:03.559
traveling 75 feet
in 6 seconds.

27:03.634 --> 27:07.232
The flight attendant
going cross-country!

27:07.307 --> 27:10.439
Whoa, my goodness!
She's alive and well.

27:10.514 --> 27:11.992
We're playing "Frogger."

27:12.067 --> 27:14.392
Still has to get all the way
to Devil's Skull Rock.

27:14.467 --> 27:17.712
What? I don't know what I'm
gonna do here.

27:17.787 --> 27:19.512
Does she taxi backwards?

27:19.587 --> 27:22.319
- There we go!
- Runway, baby.

27:22.394 --> 27:25.152
Seatbelts fastened,
tray tables up.

27:25.227 --> 27:26.512
- Kat!
- I don't know! I don't know.

27:26.587 --> 27:28.392
- No?
- Oh, my God, I don't know.

27:28.467 --> 27:29.992
Stop. Not cleared
for landing.

27:30.067 --> 27:32.759
- Kat's tentative.
- Okay. Whew!

27:32.834 --> 27:37.159
I give her a 1 in 1,000 chance
of making this.

27:39.387 --> 27:42.119
How about some speed,
flaps down...

27:42.194 --> 27:43.712
and--oh, no!

27:43.787 --> 27:46.192
Oh, my goodness.

27:46.267 --> 27:47.712
Oh, my gosh.

27:47.787 --> 27:51.232
Kat, turn off the lights,
the party's over.

27:51.241 --> 27:52.752
That is all...

27:52.827 --> 27:55.199
BOTH: she...wrote!

27:56.307 --> 27:58.272
Listen, we've had
some great battles here.

27:58.347 --> 28:00.352
I think they all
pale in comparison

28:00.427 --> 28:03.239
to Ashley versus the rope.

28:04.267 --> 28:06.152
Ready, Frogger One?

28:06.227 --> 28:08.952
- I am ready.
- Here we go!

28:09.027 --> 28:10.559
All right.

28:11.467 --> 28:13.799
Ladies and gentlemen...

28:13.874 --> 28:15.519
Ash.

28:21.907 --> 28:22.832
It's over.

28:22.907 --> 28:24.239
It's over.

28:24.314 --> 28:25.719
She got farther this time.
Now, hold on.

28:25.794 --> 28:27.359
She's making progress.

28:27.434 --> 28:29.312
She went almost twice as far

28:29.387 --> 28:30.999
as she did
on the first crossing.

28:31.074 --> 28:32.352
Can we get Ash some boots?

28:32.427 --> 28:34.072
Maybe with little Icarus
wings on 'em?

28:34.147 --> 28:35.559
That might help.

28:37.107 --> 28:39.079
Can we get Ash a boat, even?

28:40.307 --> 28:41.679
- Kat?
- Yo!

28:41.754 --> 28:43.072
[chuckles]

28:43.147 --> 28:44.872
Are you ready?

28:44.947 --> 28:46.552
Yeah, I guess.

28:46.627 --> 28:49.519
Frogger Two,
away we go.

28:52.547 --> 28:54.152
Make this quick
so we can get more Ash.

28:54.227 --> 28:55.272
Here we go,

28:55.347 --> 28:57.272
and thank you, she's done.

28:57.347 --> 28:59.272
Two lives down.
Go back to Ash.

28:59.347 --> 29:02.392
Ash cam.
There's our star!

29:02.467 --> 29:05.712
Ash McIntosh,
the people's champion,

29:05.787 --> 29:07.032
who must be proud today

29:07.107 --> 29:08.552
'cause she has
an unbreakable will.

29:08.627 --> 29:10.552
She's gonna have to get
all the way

29:10.627 --> 29:13.192
to the Desert Island
to tie Kat.

29:13.267 --> 29:15.352
Our money maker's
standing over there

29:15.427 --> 29:17.759
with 50 pounds of Band-aids
and some green gloves

29:17.834 --> 29:20.159
from 1995 for the Jets.

29:21.147 --> 29:22.632
- All right.
- Ladies and gentlemen

29:22.641 --> 29:23.952
and Frogger fans,

29:24.027 --> 29:26.719
you wanted more Ash,
you get more Ash!

29:26.794 --> 29:28.959
There she is and she's down!

29:30.587 --> 29:33.472
Can somebody pump some quarters
into the machine for Ash?

29:33.547 --> 29:34.872
I don't want this thing
to be over.

29:34.947 --> 29:36.152
[giggling helplessly]

29:36.227 --> 29:39.152
Oh, my gosh. Ash!

29:39.227 --> 29:43.352
An iconic figure
in the world of Frogger.

29:43.361 --> 29:45.152
I can't get enough, Wayans.

29:45.227 --> 29:47.712
- [giggling]
- That's my GOAT right there.

29:47.787 --> 29:50.712
Wow. Kat v. Ash
might be my favorite battle

29:50.787 --> 29:52.999
- we've ever seen on the show.
- My face hurts.

29:53.867 --> 29:55.032
From laughing.

29:55.947 --> 29:57.952
One of the strangest battles
we've ever seen.

29:58.027 --> 29:59.159
Had to be won by someone.

29:59.234 --> 30:01.552
It was Kat.
She did enough,

30:01.627 --> 30:04.352
and she is now through
to the Boss Toad Bonus Round

30:04.361 --> 30:07.512
for a shot at the $10,000
Golden Fanny Pack.

30:07.587 --> 30:10.432
What a showdown we have
coming up, my friends.

30:10.441 --> 30:13.312
Honestly, I would rather give
them all Golden Fanny Packs

30:13.387 --> 30:15.312
than subject them to
Boss Toad's Bonus Round.

30:15.387 --> 30:17.152
- Sure.
- But, uh,

30:17.227 --> 30:18.752
- uess it's not up to me.
- Mm-mm.

30:18.761 --> 30:20.752
Stay tuned, my friends.

30:20.827 --> 30:22.592
Here comes Boss Toad.

30:22.667 --> 30:26.039
I'm just pinching myself.
I love this stuff.

30:34.754 --> 30:37.439
[Boss Toad growling]

30:37.514 --> 30:41.119
He is the CEO of stink.

30:42.467 --> 30:46.559
He preys on the most
vulnerable baby froglets.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.839
He basks in the filth
of his own slime.

30:54.674 --> 30:58.039
He is...Boss Toad.

31:00.787 --> 31:02.152
Hold your noses, guys.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.639
He reeks of swamp sewage.

31:05.507 --> 31:09.912
That breath. Dang.

31:09.987 --> 31:11.312
In the Boss Toad round,

31:11.387 --> 31:12.699
our Froggers
each get five minutes

31:12.774 --> 31:14.799
to rescue
as many froglets as they can.

31:14.874 --> 31:17.279
Froggers start in the middle
of the crossing

31:17.354 --> 31:19.112
and they can choose
any route they want

31:19.187 --> 31:20.832
to get the job done.

31:20.907 --> 31:22.072
But they only have one life,

31:22.081 --> 31:24.439
so if they fall in,
game over.

31:25.441 --> 31:26.992
You know the old
classic saying, man--

31:27.067 --> 31:29.352
"Frogger" ain't over
till the Boss Toad sings.

31:29.361 --> 31:30.999
That's not
an old classic saying.

31:31.074 --> 31:32.472
It is where I'm from.

31:32.547 --> 31:33.839
Aren't you from Vermont?

31:34.681 --> 31:37.199
Taking on Boss Toad Temple
tonight,

31:37.274 --> 31:41.192
confident Danny
and his boulder shoulders,

31:41.267 --> 31:44.232
Acrobat Marley
and his man bun.

31:44.241 --> 31:47.272
But first up,
it's high-flying Kat.

31:47.347 --> 31:48.999
What has she got?

31:49.074 --> 31:50.872
- Hello, Kat.
- Hi!

31:50.947 --> 31:54.952
Five minutes, one life.
Are you ready?

31:55.027 --> 31:56.832
I don't know!

31:56.907 --> 31:58.559
Here we go!

32:04.627 --> 32:06.552
- Okay, hold on...
- Decision making time here.

32:06.627 --> 32:07.792
It's a choose-your-own-
adventure here.

32:07.867 --> 32:09.152
Which way does she go?

32:09.227 --> 32:10.919
So many different ways
to approach this.

32:10.994 --> 32:13.399
I got this.
I got this.

32:14.947 --> 32:16.912
All right, she's on Harriet
the Hippo, or is she?

32:16.921 --> 32:18.672
You remember, if she
goes down in the water,

32:18.747 --> 32:20.319
it is already over.

32:22.841 --> 32:24.752
- Kat? Off of Harriet.
- All right.

32:24.827 --> 32:27.312
And, ooh, a rough jump,
but she's there.

32:27.387 --> 32:29.079
Little bit shaken up.

32:32.161 --> 32:33.712
All right, so she looks
to be headed

32:33.721 --> 32:35.592
right towards Toad Temple,
Wayans.

32:35.667 --> 32:38.032
She--oh, no, she's not!
She deeked us!

32:38.041 --> 32:39.632
She's going up the helipad.

32:39.707 --> 32:42.272
There is already one froglet
there waiting for her.

32:42.347 --> 32:44.399
Aggressive, I like it.

32:45.387 --> 32:47.552
All right, now,
how will she use the froglet

32:47.561 --> 32:50.072
in relation to
the Hopper Chopper 1000?

32:50.147 --> 32:52.712
She's going with
the classic leg pinch.

32:52.787 --> 32:54.952
And here comes
Hopper Chopper 1000.

32:55.027 --> 32:58.392
Bam! A 68-foot ride.
Do not drop the froglet.

32:58.467 --> 33:00.232
Good news, Wayans,
she'll be right on the beach

33:00.307 --> 33:01.832
if she can land this.

33:01.907 --> 33:04.072
Oh, and she waits?

33:04.147 --> 33:05.952
Ooh! A rough landing.
It's okay.

33:06.027 --> 33:08.039
Froglet--froglet's all right!

33:08.114 --> 33:09.432
- All right.
- We got one!

33:09.507 --> 33:11.232
- One is in the bank!
- We got one!

33:11.307 --> 33:13.159
We're cooking, here.
Kat came to play.

33:14.234 --> 33:16.439
Ooh! A nicely timed jump.

33:16.514 --> 33:18.232
Lay down in there
a little bit.

33:18.307 --> 33:20.512
The agility of a cat--
can't lay down, Wayans.

33:20.587 --> 33:22.679
She's gotta rescue
these younglings.

33:22.754 --> 33:24.032
Okay, she gets it out.

33:24.107 --> 33:25.559
Now she can toss it.
This is fair.

33:26.747 --> 33:28.632
Is she gonna leave
the froglet?

33:28.707 --> 33:30.832
It doesn't count, 'cause
it has to be in the bassinet.

33:30.841 --> 33:32.632
She should've--she should've
just put it in there.

33:32.707 --> 33:34.119
She's gonna run out of time
on the course.

33:36.027 --> 33:37.552
Not a great mother.

33:37.627 --> 33:39.872
We may have to contact
the Frogger Protection Services.

33:39.947 --> 33:44.319
That is a very diligent agency.
They're watching intently.

33:46.027 --> 33:48.432
Now Kat,
over three minutes in,

33:48.507 --> 33:49.952
gonna have to go the gator.

33:50.027 --> 33:52.032
Still only one froglet
on the scoreboard.

33:52.107 --> 33:53.512
That's not gonna get it done.

33:53.587 --> 33:56.399
This is a huge jump
on the spinning turtle.

33:56.474 --> 33:57.832
Here comes Kat.

33:57.841 --> 34:00.192
This is over if she goes
into the water.

34:00.267 --> 34:01.512
What is she doing, Damon?

34:01.587 --> 34:03.239
She seems to be
changing her mind.

34:04.147 --> 34:05.512
I'm confused. I don't--

34:05.587 --> 34:06.832
- I'm shook.
- Wow.

34:06.841 --> 34:08.432
I think
she's trying to go back

34:08.507 --> 34:11.399
to put the #2 froglet
inside the basket.

34:11.474 --> 34:13.632
'Cause she knows,
time's a tickin'!

34:13.707 --> 34:15.479
She's got just over
30 seconds left.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.472
She's gonna put
that froglet to bed,

34:17.547 --> 34:21.152
and maybe live and die
with two on the board.

34:21.227 --> 34:23.632
Can she work her way up?
Okay.

34:23.641 --> 34:26.232
- Wayans, this is fascinating.
- Smart move, Kat.

34:26.307 --> 34:28.479
Two froglets on the board.

34:30.561 --> 34:32.232
- Yes!
- It's over,

34:32.307 --> 34:34.319
and Kat's gonna
have herself a party.

34:35.187 --> 34:36.752
She's gonna live and die
with two, Wayans.

34:36.827 --> 34:38.432
I wonder if that two's
gonna be enough.

34:38.507 --> 34:40.799
It seems like it left it
a little thin.

34:42.707 --> 34:45.952
So Danny Shoulders needs
to beat Kat's two froglets

34:46.027 --> 34:47.639
to take the lead.

34:48.761 --> 34:50.959
- What is up, Danny?
- What's good?

34:51.034 --> 34:52.439
You know
what you're up against.

34:52.514 --> 34:54.032
Yep. I'm gonna win.

34:54.107 --> 34:55.639
Here we go!

34:59.587 --> 35:01.472
They call him
the Frog of Wall Street.

35:01.547 --> 35:02.912
Okay, here he is,
no problem.

35:02.987 --> 35:04.592
Danny gotta pull himself up
right away.

35:04.667 --> 35:07.392
He's also going the route
of the hippo, Wayans.

35:07.467 --> 35:10.599
Does he go Hopper Chopper
or is he scaling the pyramid?

35:10.674 --> 35:12.112
I think he's going
Hopper Chopper.

35:12.121 --> 35:13.752
We'll find out right now.

35:13.827 --> 35:14.832
- Okay.
- Yep.

35:14.907 --> 35:16.232
Hopper Chopper.

35:16.307 --> 35:19.072
So he's gonna duplicate
Kat's strategy

35:19.147 --> 35:20.432
and maybe improve on it.

35:20.507 --> 35:21.872
I think he's already
improved on it.

35:21.947 --> 35:24.239
He's off to a start.
That's a start for sure.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.352
- Scaling this easily.
- Absolutely thorough.

35:28.427 --> 35:31.472
He rubbed the moisture
off his hands before scaling it.

35:31.547 --> 35:33.792
That's Boss Toad-type stuff
right there.

35:33.867 --> 35:35.559
And we got a froglet.

35:35.634 --> 35:38.712
Interesting he does not choose
to use his deltoid muscle

35:38.787 --> 35:40.672
to secure the froglet,
which I wouldn't think

35:40.681 --> 35:42.432
is playing to your strength,
but again, look at that.

35:42.507 --> 35:45.432
Wicking the moisture.
#Wicking it off.

35:45.507 --> 35:47.432
Okay, go on. Here we go!

35:47.507 --> 35:51.032
Hopper Chopper 1000.
Can it contain the weight?

35:51.107 --> 35:53.032
Oh, he's doing pullups!

35:53.107 --> 35:54.999
- You are a legend.
- Okay. Okay.

35:55.074 --> 35:56.832
"If I'm gonna be hanging here,
might as well get a pump in."

35:56.907 --> 35:58.192
Yeah. Quick pump!

35:58.201 --> 35:59.752
- Great.
- All right, one froglet down.

35:59.827 --> 36:01.072
Tucked it in.

36:01.147 --> 36:02.392
I got goosebumps
from what I just saw.

36:02.401 --> 36:03.832
That was amazing.

36:03.907 --> 36:05.272
Oh, that was like Jordan
from the free throw line.

36:05.347 --> 36:07.592
The dismount was amazing, too.

36:07.667 --> 36:09.792
- All right.
- One froglet in.

36:09.867 --> 36:11.512
Right to the second one.
Now does he take

36:11.521 --> 36:13.512
a quick trip back?
He probably should.

36:13.587 --> 36:16.112
He can put two in the bank
and already beat Kat,

36:16.187 --> 36:18.152
because he did it quicker.

36:18.227 --> 36:19.759
He's got three minutes left.

36:20.707 --> 36:22.192
- Plenty of time.
- Great time.

36:22.267 --> 36:23.792
But Marley Webster
is waiting in the wings.

36:23.867 --> 36:25.152
Don't want to leave anything
out on the course.

36:25.227 --> 36:26.632
Where you going?

36:26.707 --> 36:28.192
I think he's gotta get
to Toad Temple, right?

36:28.267 --> 36:29.552
The turtle is really difficult.

36:29.627 --> 36:31.792
Danny Shoulders
is bringing it!

36:31.867 --> 36:34.592
Absolutely. We call him
<i> Danny de los Hombros.</i>

36:34.601 --> 36:36.272
I didn't see
that lily pad there.

36:36.347 --> 36:39.032
Here comes the gator jump,
and...

36:39.107 --> 36:40.472
Okay, no problem.

36:40.547 --> 36:43.632
Spinning,
wet Tommy the Turtle.

36:43.707 --> 36:45.712
But there's that third froglet
which would give him the lead.

36:45.787 --> 36:47.992
- Mm.
- Big jump coming up right now.

36:48.067 --> 36:49.752
We've seen this with turtles.
You get your fingers

36:49.827 --> 36:52.679
into those shell grooves
to secure yourself.

36:54.227 --> 36:56.192
Can he do it?

36:56.267 --> 36:58.392
Ooh! He stepped on the head!

36:58.467 --> 37:01.312
- Great job, man!
- That looked painful.

37:01.387 --> 37:03.632
- Great timing, great strategy.
- Yeah.

37:03.707 --> 37:05.479
Now you gotta jump off of it.

37:06.387 --> 37:07.952
Thumbs up.
Okay, go, buddy.

37:07.961 --> 37:09.392
- Go.
- All right.

37:09.467 --> 37:11.992
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Oh, he lost the froglet!

37:12.001 --> 37:13.512
The froglet is lost.
It's off.

37:13.587 --> 37:15.679
That was a huge, huge drop.

37:16.921 --> 37:18.199
Ohh!

37:30.674 --> 37:32.872
- All right.
- Oh, oh, oh!

37:32.881 --> 37:33.992
Ohh!

37:34.067 --> 37:35.192
Oh, he lost the froglet!

37:35.267 --> 37:36.552
The froglet is lost.
It's off.

37:36.627 --> 37:39.119
That was a huge, huge drop.

37:40.587 --> 37:42.712
Oh, no, I don't know if he can
get this thing.

37:42.787 --> 37:44.185
Oh, my God!

37:46.467 --> 37:49.872
Will not leave it behind.
No froglets left behind.

37:49.947 --> 37:52.312
Oh, dude? Dude?
Use your leg.

37:52.387 --> 37:54.359
Use your leg,
you son of a gun!

37:56.827 --> 37:59.272
- Can it get any more tense?
- Wow!

37:59.347 --> 38:00.979
Oh, my God, this guy!

38:01.054 --> 38:02.952
Ironically, it comes down
to his shoulder strength

38:03.027 --> 38:05.079
in his most important moment.

38:05.154 --> 38:06.872
Gotta get the froggy!

38:06.947 --> 38:09.432
He's almost willing it to him,
like Wilson the volleyball!

38:09.507 --> 38:11.392
Come on, froglet.
Damon, he should ditch it.

38:11.401 --> 38:12.992
I would get rid of it
right now.

38:13.067 --> 38:14.752
- Ditch it, baby.
- He's gonna spend all the time

38:14.827 --> 38:16.712
waiting for that froglet,
it's not coming back.

38:16.787 --> 38:18.912
Get the leg. That's what I said
you should have done before!

38:18.987 --> 38:20.479
Now it's too late!

38:23.154 --> 38:25.719
It's gone. Let it go!

38:27.307 --> 38:29.352
Now if he falls...

38:29.427 --> 38:30.839
- If he falls, it's over.
- Wow.

38:33.387 --> 38:34.832
Look at him. There's
a resignation right there.

38:34.907 --> 38:37.552
Danny, don't give up.
You still have some time.

38:37.627 --> 38:39.919
It's gone, bro. It's gone.

38:41.707 --> 38:44.392
Reach that thing. He's got
the leg of the gator.

38:44.467 --> 38:46.312
And he's off! And he's down.

38:46.387 --> 38:48.279
Dun dun dun! He gone.

38:51.587 --> 38:54.279
Damn!
- All right! He's alive!

38:54.354 --> 38:55.512
And even with
that disappointment,

38:55.587 --> 38:57.312
Danny takes the lead.

38:57.387 --> 39:00.112
He collected two froglets,
like Kat,

39:00.187 --> 39:02.072
but he got them quicker.

39:02.147 --> 39:04.679
This should be a great one.
Marley is incredible.

39:04.754 --> 39:06.472
He has just now seen
his fellow competitors

39:06.547 --> 39:09.512
take to the course,
so he knows what he has to do.

39:09.587 --> 39:12.632
Three froglets, he wins.
It's over.

39:12.707 --> 39:15.352
Oh, this is pressure right now.

39:15.427 --> 39:17.232
I'm on record
that I think Marley

39:17.307 --> 39:18.712
is the best
in the Froggerverse,

39:18.787 --> 39:22.152
but one slip here,
he is into the water

39:22.227 --> 39:23.439
and going home.

39:23.514 --> 39:25.792
I do not want
to lose right now.

39:25.867 --> 39:27.792
Go Marley!

39:27.867 --> 39:30.992
- Marley, the stage is set.
- Let's go, Damon.

39:31.067 --> 39:34.032
You need to rescue three baby
froglets to win.

39:34.107 --> 39:36.032
Uh, if you get two,
it'll come down to time.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.199
- To time, perfect.
- You have what it takes, sir?

39:38.274 --> 39:39.919
- I think so.
- I think you do, too.

39:39.994 --> 39:41.592
My man.

39:41.667 --> 39:44.519
Ready, Frogger?
Here we go!

39:51.387 --> 39:52.712
Let's go.

39:52.787 --> 39:55.712
Marley Webster,
welcome to Boss Toad--

39:55.787 --> 39:57.552
Oh, my goodness,
did he hold on?

39:57.627 --> 39:59.632
He's--oh, it's over!
It's over!

39:59.641 --> 40:01.719
- Oh, my God!
- Unbelievable!

40:02.747 --> 40:04.872
Oh, my goodness.

40:04.947 --> 40:07.319
Are you...kidding me?

40:07.394 --> 40:09.632
- Whoo! Yes!
- Danny won this thing.

40:09.707 --> 40:12.112
- Yes!
- Marley is out.

40:12.187 --> 40:14.152
The upset of the ages.

40:14.227 --> 40:17.472
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

40:17.547 --> 40:20.712
I told...it again!

40:20.787 --> 40:22.712
Oh, let's go!

40:22.787 --> 40:24.752
Stunning events
in the Froggerverse.

40:24.827 --> 40:28.192
But huge congratulations to
tonight's top frog--

40:28.201 --> 40:30.552
Danny, who has just
won tonight's

40:30.627 --> 40:33.872
$10,000 Golden Fanny Pack,
and he's got a ticket

40:33.881 --> 40:36.912
straight to that
Ultimate Frogger Championship.

40:36.987 --> 40:39.072
What a great night
of froggin' we've just seen.

40:39.147 --> 40:40.079
We are fired up.

40:40.154 --> 40:41.359
[laughs]
