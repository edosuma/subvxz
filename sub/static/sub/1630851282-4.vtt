- Good news,

20:29.689 --> 20:33.448
I've actually recovered
about half of my panda.

20:33.517 --> 20:34.965
Once I've recovered
all the pieces,

20:35.034 --> 20:36.517
I'll stitch him back together.

20:36.586 --> 20:38.379
Sure, he may look
absolutely terrifying,

20:38.448 --> 20:40.586
but at least it'll be mine.

20:40.655 --> 20:42.896
- You just gave me an idea.

20:42.965 --> 20:45.862
Ruby, you're going to find
the rest of the panda bits.

20:45.931 --> 20:47.482
- What?

20:47.551 --> 20:50.551
You want me to look through
an entire dump for panda parts?

20:50.620 --> 20:51.758
No way.

20:51.827 --> 20:53.896
- You trapped us
in a trash compactor.

20:53.965 --> 20:55.551
- And almost got us crushed.

20:55.620 --> 20:59.000
- Yeah, and you're acting like
real babies about it.

20:59.068 --> 21:02.068
- You're doing it.
- Who's gonna make me?

21:02.137 --> 21:03.448
- Briles.

21:03.517 --> 21:05.000
Come stand behind us
and look intimidating.

21:07.586 --> 21:09.137
- Being intimidating's
the other reason

21:09.206 --> 21:10.689
I got to where I am today.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.241
- Fine.

21:14.310 --> 21:17.000
I'll find the rest
of the panda.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.827
- You look like a grabber.

21:23.034 --> 21:25.448
- You know what sounds good
after a day at the dump?

21:25.517 --> 21:27.137
Spa-lapalooza.

21:27.206 --> 21:30.344
Hey, Briles, since Ruby's busy,
you want her ticket?

21:30.413 --> 21:33.000
- Yes!
This mani needs a pedi.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.620
- I should call Fisher
and let him know you're okay.

21:36.689 --> 21:39.620
- Let's wait a day.
I could use a break.

[romantic piano music]

21:44.689 --> 21:47.172
- The stars
are really out tonight.

21:47.241 --> 21:50.034
You know, technically,
this is our first date, Lex.

21:53.379 --> 21:55.931
I promise
I'll find a way to fix you

21:56.000 --> 21:57.689
right after dessert.
