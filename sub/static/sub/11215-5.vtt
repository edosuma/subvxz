00:31.332 --> 00:34.668
Previously on Southland:

00:34.702 --> 00:37.371
He was executed in one of your
Bentleys with coke on him.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.806
You're back in the game,
aren't you, Trinard?

00:38.839 --> 00:40.441
(barking)

00:40.474 --> 00:43.811
Back! Richter, back! Back!

00:43.844 --> 00:46.380
It helps me
relax, okay?

00:46.414 --> 00:48.182
Next time, I'll take you
down to the station.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.750
Get back to school.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.552
Hey, what are you doing
hanging out with these people?

00:51.585 --> 00:52.820
You lied to me
my whole life!

00:52.853 --> 00:55.456
I'm sorry about that!
My whole life!

00:55.489 --> 00:56.590
I'm here because
I love you, okay?

00:56.624 --> 00:58.226
I have an on-duty
back injury.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.727
You don't have to
explain anything to me.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.762
That pain medication allows me
to stay on the streets,

01:01.795 --> 01:03.497
or I lose my
field certification.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.133
You have any idea
how close you all came

01:05.166 --> 01:06.500
to (bleep) up a six-month
surveillance today?

01:06.534 --> 01:08.502
What are we talking about?
Trinny Day.

01:12.873 --> 01:16.677
MAN:
Veteran cops know better than
to take work home with them.

01:16.710 --> 01:20.848
Detective Sammy Bryant had to
learn this again the hard way.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.816
(hip hop song plays)

01:24.652 --> 01:26.820
* 'Cause I'm-a be
where I come from *

01:26.854 --> 01:31.159
* 'Cause I'm-a be where
I come from... *

01:31.159 --> 01:33.161
(man sings in Spanish)

01:51.279 --> 01:53.214
*

02:17.271 --> 02:18.606
(gunshots)

02:18.639 --> 02:20.774
(screaming)

02:35.556 --> 02:38.759
(camera shutter clicking)

02:38.792 --> 02:41.429
(cell phone chirping)

02:51.339 --> 02:52.606
Hello?

02:52.640 --> 02:54.475
Yo, wake your ass up, puto.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.377
You're sitting at home,
missing everything.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.845
Tweety Byrd just got lit up

02:57.878 --> 02:59.247
*like a freaking Christmas tree
three hours ago.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.551
Trinny Day's right hand?

03:03.584 --> 03:04.585
Where?

03:04.618 --> 03:05.753
Remember our last surveillance?

03:05.786 --> 03:06.754
Yeah.

03:06.787 --> 03:07.788
That's the spot.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.957
I'll-I'll be there in 20.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.292
Don't look at the camera.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.727
Damn it!

03:13.761 --> 03:17.898
I don't have time to be one
of your little projects.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.500
This is part of the "Day in
the Life of a Cop" series

03:19.533 --> 03:20.901
I've been working
on for class.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.603
Work. That's
the operative word, Tammi.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.272
This is my job.
It's real.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.840
But I thought today
was your day off.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.543
Yeah, well, my phone is ringing
because somebody's dead.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.779
Murderers don't
take days off.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.581
(sighs)

03:33.614 --> 03:37.451
Sammy, you were nicer to me
when you wore suits to work.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.691
Don't forget your
prenatal vitamins.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.058
They make me nauseous.

03:48.929 --> 03:52.833
I closed a $20
million sale today.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.736
Come on. In
this economy?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.705
So what? I had
a few sakes.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.707
In what, a
Big Gulp cup?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.742
Cooper.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.945
(car door slams)

04:04.978 --> 04:06.447
Hey, Ben.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.615
Michelle.
How you doing?

04:07.648 --> 04:08.782
Your guy any good?

04:08.816 --> 04:13.554
Mine keeps
staring at my ass.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.822
I plead the Fifth.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.790
You better.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.861
You're going
after her, Frodo?

04:20.894 --> 04:24.732
Sure. Taller boots
have tried and failed.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.370
You can think of
a clever comeback

04:29.403 --> 04:30.938
on the way to Los Feliz.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.906
(chuckles)

04:36.677 --> 04:38.846
* Sammy boy!

04:38.879 --> 04:41.515
'Sup, man? Knock
the wife up yet?

04:41.549 --> 04:43.351
Who's the other guy
next to Tweety?

04:43.384 --> 04:45.753
Juan Doe. No idea.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.488
They ripped his face
up pretty bad, though.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.656
We'll need prints
to I.D. him.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.591
(cell phone rings)

04:50.624 --> 04:53.861
Yeah, what's up, Pop?

04:53.894 --> 04:55.929
Are you kidding me?

04:55.963 --> 04:57.798
All right, look.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.768
We're gonna talk about this
when she gets home tonight.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.804
Estoy trabajando, papĞ“Â­.
Come on.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.073
All right. I'll
see you then.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.875
Jesus.

05:07.908 --> 05:11.044
Mercedes never came home again
last night.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.880
Teenagers.
You remember.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.748
Yeah. Yeah.
You just watch, man.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.717
This fatherhood thing's
a lot tougher than it looks.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.051
This thing's
got Twitter on it.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.653
You think Tweety Tweeted
before he got shot?

05:19.687 --> 05:20.988
(imitating Tweety Bird):
I tawt I saw a Puddy...

05:21.021 --> 05:22.122
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.591
Come on, man.
(laughing)

05:23.624 --> 05:24.858
You need to work on that.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.727
So, our victim
is Marcus "Tweety" Byrd,

05:26.760 --> 05:29.463
head of Platinum Motors
San Diego, and a former Crip.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.931
Now, even though Trinny
is a former Blood,

05:30.964 --> 05:32.733
these two go back
to juvie hall together.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.034
(phone rings)

05:34.067 --> 05:35.769
I mean, Bloods and Crips
getting along,

05:35.803 --> 05:37.805
that's nothing new,
but we've never seen this level

05:37.838 --> 05:39.407
of collaboration
between black and Mexicans.

05:39.407 --> 05:40.874
Trinny's rewriting
the rules.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.743
Black and brown
make green, bro.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.579
Exactly. Everybody coming
together, making money,

05:45.613 --> 05:47.080
bringing drugs
across the Tijuana border.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.816
Probably by our friend here,

05:48.849 --> 05:50.618
our dead amigo Tweety
from San Diego.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.720
So if Trinny
is making everybody rich,

05:52.753 --> 05:54.154
including the cartels,

05:54.187 --> 05:55.623
why do they want him dead?

05:55.656 --> 05:56.657
Well, who cares who
wants them dead?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.125
You have something
to add, Sal?

05:58.158 --> 06:00.528
Yeah, yeah. I got three
dead bodies in two days

06:00.561 --> 06:03.163
and one detective
available to work them.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.065
I need you to wrap
this thing up.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.867
I need my guys back.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.080
(barks)

06:20.113 --> 06:21.482
Richter!

06:21.515 --> 06:23.684
(screams)
Richter, stop it!

06:23.717 --> 06:25.719
Oh, my God.
Richter!

06:25.753 --> 06:26.987
Settle down! Settle!

06:27.020 --> 06:28.055
Stop it! Stop it!

06:28.088 --> 06:30.458
Stop! Stop! Stop!

06:30.491 --> 06:31.592
I am so sorry!

06:31.625 --> 06:33.126
So sorry!

06:33.160 --> 06:36.530
He's a drug dog,
so if he sniffs any drugs,

06:36.564 --> 06:39.633
especially marijuana,
he just goes crazy.

06:39.667 --> 06:40.801
Really?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.135
Where'd you get him?

06:42.169 --> 06:44.738
Oh, um, my husband
brought him home

06:44.772 --> 06:46.540
after he had
a nervous breakdown.

06:46.574 --> 06:47.808
The dog or your husband?

06:47.841 --> 06:49.042
(chuckles)

06:49.076 --> 06:50.878
Makes some legit money,

06:50.911 --> 06:53.046
drops the Eastside twang
from his accent,

06:53.080 --> 06:54.548
and all of a sudden
we're supposed to think

06:54.582 --> 06:55.916
that Trinny's a changed man?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.651
Yeah, right.

06:57.685 --> 07:00.087
With his hat. He's trying
to get all GQ with it.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.856
You got a hat like that.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.792
(chuckles)
Juan Doe's name
is Joaquin Perez.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.730
Where the hell
is he going?

07:09.763 --> 07:12.700
Joaquin's the guy we saw
with Nate's daughter.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.110
(baby crying)

07:23.143 --> 07:25.045
She's on the couch.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.049
(sobbing)

07:33.754 --> 07:37.525
Daddy?

07:41.695 --> 07:43.631
(sobbing)

07:56.910 --> 07:58.679
His nose was kind of...

07:58.712 --> 08:02.916
I don't care what she saw.
She's not testifying.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.952
It might come down
to her, my man.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.153
You got to get her
prepared for that.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.556
You know?

08:08.556 --> 08:10.958
I'm feeling a lot of heat
from you, Detective Salinger.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.826
You got something to say,
just say it.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.227
You arresting somebody?

08:14.261 --> 08:15.563
We're getting close.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.697
Close?
Hmm.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.566
(chuckling):
Close?

08:18.566 --> 08:19.767
All right,
I tell you what.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.969
So, you nail this
guy. Then what?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.303
Well, you stop the drugs,

08:23.336 --> 08:25.105
stop the violence.
No more bodies.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.174
No more daughters of cops
getting caught in the crossfire.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.241
It's Whac-a-Mole.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.110
Pop one Trinny,
two more pop up.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.879
This whole damn thing
is a colossal waste

08:31.912 --> 08:32.913
of manpower and resources.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.615
A waste?

08:34.648 --> 08:36.183
Listen, man, I believe in
aggressive police work.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.652
Okay? And to make
a case like this airtight,

08:38.686 --> 08:40.120
it takes time and finesse.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.989
Don't tell me
how to make a case.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.757
I made the case on this
guy over a decade ago.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.894
Yeah, that's right.
I was hooking and booking

08:46.927 --> 08:48.128
while you were still
fingerpainting, son.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.163
That's my point.
A decade ago.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.132
And a case ain't like
this made nowadays

08:52.165 --> 08:53.867
with you sitting on your ass,
waiting for the phone to ring.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.603
Well, the phone
is ringing.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.105
And I need my men working the
streets, not laid out on them.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.608
Point taken.

09:00.608 --> 09:01.775
Take Sammy back, then.

09:01.809 --> 09:04.111
But Nate?
He goes with me.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.646
Let's go, Nate.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.615
We got work to do.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.052
All right,
put your tie on.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.654
There's a murder
on Vernon.

09:13.687 --> 09:17.324
You're with me
now. Let's go.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.727
Jesus.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.695
(indistinct radio transmission)

09:27.100 --> 09:28.702
Hey, Sammy, you
know this guy?

09:28.736 --> 09:31.338
Hey. I was 13 years old

09:31.371 --> 09:33.641
the first time my cousin
put a gun in my hand.

09:33.674 --> 09:34.808
But this?

09:34.842 --> 09:37.177
These are
babies, man.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.179
Hey. Let go
of me, man.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.214
Come on.
It hurts. Let go.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.150
Munoz. What's up, man?

09:43.183 --> 09:44.151
What did he do?

09:44.184 --> 09:45.886
He made me run.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.020
You know, I caught him
tagging one of these

09:47.054 --> 09:48.355
over a bunch of names.

09:48.388 --> 09:51.191
He didn't catch me, Sammy.
I tripped!

09:51.224 --> 09:53.060
Just get him off of me.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.928
You want to end up like your
little friend over there?

09:54.962 --> 09:55.996
Huh? You want someone
to cross your name out

09:56.029 --> 09:57.397
and you end up like that?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.232
Just... can you put him
in the car for a second?

09:59.266 --> 10:01.134
Get in there. Sit down.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.372
Man, what's your problem?

10:05.405 --> 10:07.941
Hey, Sammy.
His grandfather was an ass.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.142
His father's an ass.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.778
His cousins,
all culeros. Come on.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.113
He's my problem.
I'll take care of him.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.349
He's got my cuffs.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.119
I'll get them back.

10:19.152 --> 10:22.656
Get out.
Come on.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.167
Don't make them run.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.803
The old guys hate that.

10:35.836 --> 10:39.239
If they catch you, they'll
be even more pissed off.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.941
Why were you out there
tagging, anyway?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.042
You're not in a gang.

10:44.878 --> 10:45.846
(chuckles)

10:45.879 --> 10:47.147
You checking out
that poster?

10:47.180 --> 10:51.118
Kind of soft for you,
ain't it, vato?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.920
You like kids' movies?

10:52.953 --> 10:54.154
I like the book.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.056
The book?

10:56.089 --> 10:57.057
It's a classic, fool.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.458
Where you been?

11:02.329 --> 11:04.331
Oh, that's beautiful.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.202
(quacking)

11:12.740 --> 11:14.041
(camera shutter clicking)

11:19.913 --> 11:21.849
(camera shutter clicking)

11:26.153 --> 11:31.058
Oye, huera. You get lost
on your way to Silver Lake?

11:34.127 --> 11:36.396
That's a nice camera.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.165
Can I look at it?

11:41.869 --> 11:44.004
How can I take your picture

11:44.037 --> 11:47.174
if you're holding the camera?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.342
Why would you want
to take my picture?

11:52.445 --> 11:54.782
'Cause I like your face.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.818
(camera shutter clicks)

11:57.851 --> 11:58.485
Move your head

11:58.518 --> 12:00.253
a little bit toward me.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.422
Yeah, to the left.
That's good. That's good.

12:02.455 --> 12:03.824
Yeah, yeah,
just be natural.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.994
Oh, this is going
to be beautiful.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.996
You got to give me your e-mail.
I'll send it to you, man.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.063
Yeah, sure.

12:10.097 --> 12:13.333
NATE:
Heavy power, man.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.135
GIL:
Here he comes.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.905
Looks like the freakin' devil.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.172
Mm-hmm. Trinny Day.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.473
(camera shutter clicking)

12:20.507 --> 12:22.109
(speaking Spanish)

12:22.142 --> 12:23.143
Man, what the hell?

12:23.176 --> 12:25.245
What's Sal doing here?

12:25.278 --> 12:26.513
I don't know.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.849
(camera shutter clicks)

12:30.183 --> 12:33.020
(camera shutter clicks)

12:33.053 --> 12:34.387
What the hell is he saying?

12:34.421 --> 12:36.123
Look, I'm not a freakin'
lip reader, bro.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.458
Wish he was wired.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.194
12 years, six months,

12:41.228 --> 12:42.996
three days,
and five hours--

12:43.030 --> 12:44.865
every day longer
than the next.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.834
But you did me
a favor, Sal.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.970
You gave me time to think,
time to read.

12:50.003 --> 12:53.106
(chuckles)
Read? What, Hustler?

12:53.140 --> 12:56.309
Like... Malcolm X.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.311
48 Laws of Power,
Soul on Ice.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.880
I saw how the
system is built

12:59.913 --> 13:03.216
to keep us in jail
and to keep us divided,

13:03.250 --> 13:07.454
but blacks and Mexicans
got a lot in common.

13:07.487 --> 13:11.959
You know, we both worked
the fields for the white man.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.261
We like the same oldies.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.164
We both can appreciate
a thick girl with a fat ass.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.566
And that's why I got
into the car game
when I got out.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.334
'Cause, you know,
I figured

13:21.368 --> 13:24.371
I could bring the street people
together in a positive way

13:24.404 --> 13:26.974
and stop all of this black
and Mexican violence.

13:27.007 --> 13:27.875
A positive way?

13:27.875 --> 13:29.276
Miguel Ramos was shanked

13:29.309 --> 13:32.880
in prison hours after my
detectives talked to you.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.447
You did that.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.517
Prove it.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.053
Tweety? Loco?

13:40.087 --> 13:42.890
Tell me something.
Those bullets meant for you, T?

13:42.890 --> 13:46.994
The rain pours on the just
and the unjust alike.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.595
You're back in the game.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.463
Whatever it is
you're getting away with,

13:50.497 --> 13:52.265
ain't gonna last.
You know that.

13:52.299 --> 13:58.038
I'm handsome. I'm black.
I'm rich, and I'm legal.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.372
And you can't stand it.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.108
You come in,
you talk to us

14:01.141 --> 14:02.409
man-to-man, all right?

14:02.442 --> 14:05.145
Maybe we can
work a deal.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.081
Or stay out here
and get eaten alive.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.017
It's your choice.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.551
You think I'm scared of some

14:11.584 --> 14:15.222
cowboy-hat-wearing,
accordion-playing fools, huh?

14:15.255 --> 14:16.489
You out of your mind?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.025
I'm not scared of nothing.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.027
I'm not scared of anybody,
okay?

14:20.060 --> 14:22.095
They want to bring it,
they can bring it.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.231
Look around you, Trinny.
Look around you.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.199
What do you see, huh?

14:26.233 --> 14:28.035
Tombstones.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.537
If you're dead, you can't
take it with you, T.

14:30.570 --> 14:34.241
It's your choice.

14:34.274 --> 14:38.078
Do the right thing,
all right?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.970
Hey, see this?

15:03.003 --> 15:06.206
Perverts upskirt.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.214
Something's wrong
with your iPod.
What?

15:14.247 --> 15:15.548
Yeah.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.985
Hold on, man.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.087
No, I don't know.
Hang on a second.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.388
I think it's got a...

15:21.421 --> 15:23.356
(plastic snapping)

15:23.390 --> 15:24.992
I think they're in...

15:28.996 --> 15:32.465
Yeah. Yeah, see, that's
not supposed to do that.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.667
It's not.
I just don't even...

15:34.701 --> 15:36.503
(clatters)

15:36.536 --> 15:38.038
Did you want that?

15:38.071 --> 15:40.307
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
Come on.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.741
Damn.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.011
You know what, if you got
a complaint, though,

15:44.011 --> 15:46.546
you can call this number
right here.

15:46.579 --> 15:49.449
Now you just explain to them
what was on your iPod,

15:49.482 --> 15:51.318
and what you were
doing with it,

15:51.351 --> 15:53.453
and I'm sure
they'll replace it for you.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.157
You have a good day.

16:13.106 --> 16:16.076
Look, I told him...

16:16.109 --> 16:17.310
don't be a (bleep) culero

16:17.344 --> 16:19.212
like your father
or your cousins.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.514
But he don't
listen to me.

16:21.548 --> 16:25.185
Well, most kids
don't listen.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.354
But Juanito is smart.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.528
He's very smart.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.664
Yeah?
Yeah.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.299
He is.
(cell phone chimes)

16:39.332 --> 16:40.367
He's muy listo.

16:40.400 --> 16:45.205
Just, uh... if you don't mind,

16:45.238 --> 16:47.607
I'd like to check in on him
from time to time.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.542
Is he in trouble?

16:49.576 --> 16:51.078
No, ma'am, he's not,

16:51.111 --> 16:53.246
but I'd like to make sure
he stays that way.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.757
Do you have
to go right now?

17:04.791 --> 17:05.825
Yeah, it's...

17:05.858 --> 17:08.328
it's getting late.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.663
SAMMY:
You all right?
I'm good.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.399
What do you think of my mom?

17:12.432 --> 17:15.568
She's a nice lady.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.770
She's not seeing
anyone, you know.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.739
Okay, okay. I got to go.

17:21.674 --> 17:25.712
Think you can stay out of
trouble for more than 24 hours?

17:28.181 --> 17:30.350
What are you doing
tomorrow, huh?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.819
Nothing. Staying here.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.454
Here?
Yeah.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.723
All right.
All right.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.561
(siren blares)

17:42.762 --> 17:45.632
Wait.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.601
Great police work, Sal.

17:48.635 --> 17:52.139
I guess sitting behind a desk
teaches that kind of stuff, huh?

17:52.172 --> 17:54.141
You just tainted a
six-month investigation.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.676
You knew we were watching
and you just walk right in, huh?

17:56.709 --> 17:58.445
You think I could take
this to court now?

17:58.478 --> 18:00.147
You're wasting everybody's time
and you know it.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.215
No, what I do know is
that you're on the take.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.717
You work for Trinny.
That's why you want to
bust up my task force.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.819
No, no, no, you're the one
on the take, cowboy.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.555
Grabbing up all my people,

18:08.588 --> 18:11.524
wasting money on helicopters,
cameras, and for what?

18:11.558 --> 18:14.161
Huh? You are never going to find
Trinny in the same room

18:14.161 --> 18:15.662
with dope and guns,
and you know it.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.598
Listen, just stay the hell away
from my investigation.

18:18.631 --> 18:19.632
Can you do that?

18:19.666 --> 18:21.234
You're a fossil, man.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.635
You couldn't find your ass
with both hands.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.172
Back up!

18:25.172 --> 18:26.206
Back up!

18:26.239 --> 18:27.474
Both of you!

18:27.507 --> 18:30.177
Sal, Sal, you can't
afford this.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.644
You can't afford this!

18:31.678 --> 18:34.347
I'm a D-3. I can
have your badge.
Take my badge!

18:34.381 --> 18:35.615
Sal...
You think I'm
scared of you?

18:35.648 --> 18:36.616
Take my badge.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.918
It's right here.

18:38.951 --> 18:43.190
This ain't over.
This is not over.
Damn right it ain't over.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.357
You're damn lucky
he's here.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.698
Tammi.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.766
Hi.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.368
Hi!

18:59.272 --> 19:01.574
That's Payaso from
Tortilla Flats.

19:01.608 --> 19:02.875
Do you know Julio?

19:02.909 --> 19:04.911
Julio?

19:04.944 --> 19:07.280
Yeah, I met him when
I was out shooting
in Echo Park.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.715
Tammi, are you
kidding me?

19:08.748 --> 19:10.683
He's a gangster.
You could have been killed.

19:10.717 --> 19:15.255
Sammy, don't be
a racist pig.

19:15.288 --> 19:18.591
Tammi, tattooed tears,
the web on his elbow.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.660
He murdered people
to earn those.

19:20.693 --> 19:23.896
His name has come up
in about four different
open investigations

19:23.930 --> 19:25.398
and you're taking
pictures of him?

19:25.432 --> 19:27.267
Do you have any idea
what could have happened

19:27.300 --> 19:28.735
if he knew you
were my wife?

19:28.768 --> 19:32.572
My photographs are good, Sammy.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.574
They're actually really good.

19:34.607 --> 19:35.842
Did you even look at these?

19:35.875 --> 19:36.776
You take a pretty photo

19:36.809 --> 19:38.678
of a loser like that

19:38.711 --> 19:42.249
who kills kids and sells drugs,
and you want me to admire it?

19:42.249 --> 19:43.683
This is my work, Sammy!

19:43.716 --> 19:45.352
This is real.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.720
This is what I do.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.690
You might want to check it out
sometime.

19:55.828 --> 19:59.832
(woman speaking Spanish)

19:59.866 --> 20:03.570
(both yelling in Spanish)

20:06.606 --> 20:07.707
(speaking Spanish)

20:07.740 --> 20:08.808
SeĞ“Â±or...

20:08.841 --> 20:10.410
Amigo, there's no problem.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.445
My wife just have a little
too much to drink.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.713
y(yelling in Spanish)

20:13.746 --> 20:15.648
Okay, okay.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.517
SeĞ“Â±ora, seĞ“Â±ora...

20:17.550 --> 20:18.685
(speaking Spanish)

20:26.893 --> 20:28.661
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

20:28.695 --> 20:31.564
All right, the rest of you
on the ground now.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.533
(helicopter whirring overhead)

20:33.566 --> 20:35.468
Take your hat off for me.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.003
Hat. Get your hat off.

20:39.439 --> 20:42.975
How come you didn't tell me
you spoke that much
Spanish, Benicio?

20:43.009 --> 20:44.811
(siren blaring)

20:51.017 --> 20:52.919
Dispatch made it sound
like a telenovela out here.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.421
Keep an eye on everyone.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.055
We're gonna take a look
at the apartment.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.758
Finished searching him?

20:58.791 --> 21:01.661
Why are we
going inside?

21:01.694 --> 21:03.530
It's a disturbance call.
They're all out here.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.564
See that open door?

21:04.597 --> 21:05.998
Scratch on his cheek?

21:06.032 --> 21:09.536
We always search the house
on a domestic call.

21:09.569 --> 21:10.837
Even if you've already
detained the people

21:10.870 --> 21:13.506
involved in the
dispute outside.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.708
This one guy I knew--

21:15.742 --> 21:18.511
didn't search the house
after the call,

21:18.545 --> 21:21.548
and two days later, they found
three bodies on the floor.

21:21.581 --> 21:22.715
(knocking)

21:22.749 --> 21:25.485
Police.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.588
Policia.
(woman speaking Spanish)

21:28.621 --> 21:30.490
(man speaking Spanish)

21:30.523 --> 21:31.658
Hello?

21:40.066 --> 21:42.068
(whistles)

21:53.613 --> 21:56.483
(woman continues talking)

21:56.516 --> 21:57.817
Hook 'em up!

21:57.850 --> 21:59.719
(woman talking loudly)

22:01.921 --> 22:03.590
How much?

22:03.623 --> 22:04.891
They're saying, three,
four million in cash.

22:04.924 --> 22:05.825
They're still taking
pictures of it.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.594
And you found this out

22:07.627 --> 22:08.928
because one of these guys
was plugging his wife's sister?

22:08.961 --> 22:09.962
Yeah.
I love this job, man.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.398
So where's
the money now?

22:11.398 --> 22:12.799
Watch commander's
coming in

22:12.832 --> 22:14.834
with two more guys
to monitor chain of custody.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.036
What's up with that?
They don't trust us?

22:17.069 --> 22:18.838
Right.
Want to see it?

22:18.871 --> 22:20.407
Please. Thanks.

22:20.407 --> 22:23.843
(siren wails briefly)

22:23.876 --> 22:25.412
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.481
Be nice. Be nice.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.724
Narco bling, baby.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.459
Yep. And they were
watching us

22:39.492 --> 22:40.760
while we were
watching them.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.128
So what do we got?

22:42.161 --> 22:43.796
Mother lode.

22:43.830 --> 22:44.764
(ringtones play)

22:44.797 --> 22:46.699
I'll answer it.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.769
Ğ’Ñ—Diga?

22:53.039 --> 22:55.107
(speaking Spanish)

22:55.141 --> 22:58.778
"Caballeros, the drugs
have arrived."

23:01.714 --> 23:03.583
Will they be able
to see me?

23:03.616 --> 23:05.952
No. Listen,
you go on ahead,

23:05.985 --> 23:07.954
and I'll be there
in a minute, okay?

23:07.987 --> 23:09.021
WOMAN:
Follow me.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.692
So the guns,
the ballistics,

23:12.725 --> 23:14.894
they all match 100%
both shootings--

23:14.927 --> 23:15.795
the Bentley
and the nightclub.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.464
So we got him.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.466
She points him out?

23:19.499 --> 23:20.867
Yeah, got him cold.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.877
Sounds like
you liked it.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.980
Nah, man,
it was all right.

23:34.013 --> 23:37.517
Oh, man, you should have
taken me to see this.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.752
I'm not taking you
to an R-rated movie.

23:39.786 --> 23:42.555
It's a bestseller
by Cormac McCarthy,

23:42.589 --> 23:44.791
the same dude who wrote
No Country For Old Men.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.125
I saw it on cable.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.127
I didn't know
it was a book before.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.096
You should read more.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.031
It was a good book.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.601
Don't tell anybody
I read it, though.

23:54.634 --> 23:58.004
I'm serious. Don't screw
with my street cred.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.845
Oh!

24:07.880 --> 24:08.881
Tray.

24:08.915 --> 24:09.882
Oh, thanks.

24:14.721 --> 24:16.222
Oh, crap!

24:16.255 --> 24:19.626
Dang. Hey, does your
phone have a camera?

24:19.659 --> 24:20.893
Yeah. Why?

24:20.927 --> 24:22.529
Take a picture of me.

24:22.529 --> 24:23.963
Make sure you get
all the colors.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.798
I want to show my mom.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.934
All right.

24:29.802 --> 24:30.903
Here we go.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.104
(shutter clicks)
Good.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.541
Another. The duck.

24:36.108 --> 24:40.179
And... our last one.

24:40.212 --> 24:40.947
Hey!

24:40.980 --> 24:43.249
(laughs)

24:43.282 --> 24:45.217
Where do you see yourself
in ten years?

24:45.251 --> 24:49.922
I don't.

24:49.956 --> 24:52.759
I bet you're the type
who saw Lord of the Rings,

24:52.792 --> 24:54.761
then went back
and read the books.

24:54.794 --> 24:57.830
I read the books long
before I even saw
the movie, ese.

24:57.864 --> 24:58.898
That's my point.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.733
You can read thousands
of pages,

25:00.767 --> 25:01.834
but you can't stay in class?

25:01.868 --> 25:04.837
We don't read that in class.

25:04.871 --> 25:07.840
Guns are gonna replace
the spray paint cans soon.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.008
We both know that.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.878
Do you really want
to join a gang?

25:11.911 --> 25:13.980
Do you really want
that kind of a life?

25:14.013 --> 25:16.148
We got a lot of kids
in the Explorers

25:16.182 --> 25:17.884
that are going
through the same thing,

25:17.917 --> 25:19.118
and they got through it.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.588
You're smarter than that,
Juanito.

25:21.621 --> 25:24.857
So joining your gang is better?

25:24.891 --> 25:27.594
The Explorers are not a gang.

25:27.627 --> 25:30.296
The cops are the biggest
clique in L.A.

25:30.329 --> 25:33.232
You got choices.

25:33.265 --> 25:37.704
WOMEN:
* Happy birthday to you

25:37.737 --> 25:41.307
* Happy birthday to you

25:41.340 --> 25:44.744
* Happy birthday, dear Karen

25:44.777 --> 25:48.147
* Happy birthday to you.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.249
(applause)

25:50.282 --> 25:51.851
Rich people got choices,

25:51.884 --> 25:54.120
but everybody else,

25:54.153 --> 25:57.990
you do what you gotta do.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.338
Hey, wait!

26:14.140 --> 26:16.208
You see anything?

26:16.242 --> 26:18.811
Yes, sir, he's
rolling in right now.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.847
You sure it's our boys?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.281
All right, guys,

26:22.314 --> 26:24.917
we got a blue and white
rolling in right now.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.719
Gonna wait till
she docks, all right?

26:26.753 --> 26:27.820
Hold tight.

26:32.959 --> 26:33.826
Let's move.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.772
(quietly):
Suavecito, suavecito.

26:46.906 --> 26:48.908
It's just kids, bro.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.110
Yep, rich kids.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.414
The name of the boat:
Marado.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.784
Heading in
right now, guys.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.758
Just hold tight, guys.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.059
When I say go.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.728
Yeah, yeah!
Go, go, go!

27:08.761 --> 27:09.829
Hands in the air!
(siren wailing)

27:09.862 --> 27:10.963
Hands in the air!

27:10.997 --> 27:12.264
On your knees!
On your knees!

27:12.298 --> 27:15.735
(officer speaking Spanish)

27:15.768 --> 27:16.769
Good accent, huh?

27:16.803 --> 27:18.337
Let me guess.
Prep school?

27:18.370 --> 27:20.973
Take your daddy's boat down,
come back with a bigger catch?

27:21.007 --> 27:22.174
How we lookin', Nate?

27:22.208 --> 27:25.044
Mm, smells
like Teen Spirit, bro.

27:25.077 --> 27:28.014
Teen Spirit.
(speaks Spanish)

27:28.047 --> 27:29.381
He doesn't want that now.

27:29.415 --> 27:30.917
The question of the night:

27:30.950 --> 27:34.320
which one of you two white boys

27:34.353 --> 27:35.722
is gonna bitch up first

27:35.722 --> 27:37.289
and tell me everything
I need to know?

27:40.492 --> 27:44.063
(dog barking)

27:44.096 --> 27:46.065
Shh!

27:46.098 --> 27:48.167
What was that, an olly?

27:48.200 --> 27:50.369
Yeah. How'd
you know that?

27:50.402 --> 27:52.438
I know a lot of stuff.

27:52.471 --> 27:53.940
Are you gonna have

27:53.973 --> 27:55.775
your dog attack
me again?

27:55.808 --> 27:56.876
Depends.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.845
On what?

27:58.878 --> 28:00.412
You holding?

28:00.446 --> 28:02.448
Maybe.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.387
They aren't talking.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.156
Their women
aren't talking either.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.024
We got all the
evidence we need.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.059
Everything matches.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.862
No crack.
We got his wife,

28:15.895 --> 28:17.363
the pregnant girlfriend
he really loves.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.966
We send both
their sexy asses
back to Mexico.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.433
They ain't gonna like
that, man.

28:21.467 --> 28:22.902
Cartel's gonna get pissed
they got caught,

28:22.935 --> 28:23.870
and kill those women.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.004
Ah, they'll flip.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.006
These guys are
dying to flip.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.475
They just don't
know it yet.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.778
See what's up.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.479
SeĞ“Â±or Hernand.
(speaks Spanish)

28:44.490 --> 28:46.458
Hey, man, get out of my way.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.227
What's up?

28:48.260 --> 28:49.261
Where you from?

28:49.295 --> 28:50.462
Come on, Drew.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.164
We used to kick it.
Why you playing?

28:52.198 --> 28:53.365
Where you from, fool?

28:54.466 --> 28:55.467
(all grunting)

28:55.501 --> 28:57.403
Get him!
Get him!

28:59.171 --> 29:01.340
Beatdown!

29:01.373 --> 29:03.409
(man interrogating in Spanish)

29:03.442 --> 29:05.912
"We're gonna talk
man-to-man.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.815
"Cop-to-cop.

29:10.516 --> 29:14.486
"So Trinny was smuggling drugs
for the cartel?

29:17.824 --> 29:19.959
"To get the drugs in is easy.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.527
"The hard part's getting
the money out.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.529
"That's why when you find
somebody you trust,

29:23.562 --> 29:24.330
you stick with 'em."

29:29.435 --> 29:31.838
(electric grinder rasping)

29:36.909 --> 29:39.145
(suspect speaking Spanish)

29:39.178 --> 29:42.481
"A lot of people like Trinny.
He's smart,

29:42.514 --> 29:44.450
focused, very detailed."

29:44.483 --> 29:45.985
All right!

29:46.018 --> 29:48.955
(speaking Spanish)

29:48.988 --> 29:52.224
"All right, you haven't
answered my question:

29:52.258 --> 29:54.493
What does Trinny do?"

29:59.131 --> 30:02.468
"Trinny doesn't deal with guns.
He doesn't deal with drugs.

30:02.501 --> 30:05.204
"Real money is in the money.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.106
"That's what he smuggles for us.

30:09.375 --> 30:11.477
"Everybody wants money, right?

30:11.510 --> 30:13.279
"Bankers, politicians,

30:13.312 --> 30:15.247
"and everybody
has their price.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.552
"So Trinny had his price, right?

30:20.586 --> 30:23.255
"Let me guess. He was skimming
money off the top.

30:23.289 --> 30:24.857
Stealing from the cartel,
right?"

30:24.891 --> 30:26.959
Ooh-ee! (laughs)

30:26.993 --> 30:28.427
This is what
I'm talking about!

30:28.460 --> 30:29.561
Like that, huh?

30:29.595 --> 30:31.931
Nice!

30:34.566 --> 30:36.135
"There has to be honor
amongst thieves.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.469
You can't steal.
Those are the rules."

30:47.413 --> 30:48.981
(tires squeal)

30:53.986 --> 31:00.426
"When you break the rules,
there will be consequences.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.394
Justice must prevail."

31:02.428 --> 31:04.030
There you go.

31:06.098 --> 31:08.400
(rap music playing)

31:15.207 --> 31:17.043
(sirens approaching)

31:28.154 --> 31:29.521
(music stops)

31:29.555 --> 31:31.457
All clear.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.025
There's no Trinny.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.260
No nobody.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.428
Yo, let's take the office.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.309
(sighs)

31:50.342 --> 31:52.979
(speaks Spanish)

31:56.015 --> 31:59.085
Maybe we should get
the dogs to sniff it.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.387
What's wrong?
You scared?

32:01.420 --> 32:02.554
Scared?

32:02.588 --> 32:03.422
Come on.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.457
Open it up.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.169
Oh!

32:19.371 --> 32:20.472
Whew!

32:20.506 --> 32:22.608
(dog barking)
Richter!

32:22.641 --> 32:25.377
Richter, chill!

32:25.411 --> 32:27.646
Just chill right now!
(laughing)

32:27.679 --> 32:29.348
I'm sorry, man.

32:29.381 --> 32:30.516
He just goes nuts.

32:30.549 --> 32:33.619
It's chill. It's chill.

32:33.652 --> 32:37.623
(laughing):
Hey, slow your roll.

32:37.656 --> 32:42.061
Wh-- Hey, slow your roll!

32:42.094 --> 32:43.562
What are you, like,

32:43.595 --> 32:45.197
one of these white kids
who thinks he's black?

32:45.231 --> 32:46.532
No.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.434
See, you're smoking
kind of fast.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.736
That's medical marijuana.

32:50.769 --> 32:53.739
Blueberry Kush will
knock you on your ass.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.274
How old are you?

32:55.307 --> 32:58.544
17.
Son...

32:58.577 --> 33:02.748
I been smoking chronic since
before The Chronic came out.

33:02.781 --> 33:06.285
That was like
eight years ago.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.519
(laughing)

33:07.553 --> 33:09.055
You think I'm talking about

33:09.088 --> 33:10.656
The Chronic 2001.

33:10.689 --> 33:14.393
Yeah, you must really
be a youngster.

33:15.561 --> 33:18.064
Mushrooms.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.765
I thought you got
the bacon-Swiss.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.733
No, no, no, mushrooms.

33:21.767 --> 33:24.436
That's what they call
innocent bystanders

33:24.470 --> 33:26.738
that pop up in the way of
stray bullets during drive-bys.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.107
They pop up like mushrooms.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.408
That's dark.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.743
You think this is
a stray bullet call?

33:31.777 --> 33:33.445
Does it matter?

33:33.479 --> 33:37.316
I can't even keep
cases straight anymore.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.518
Yo, Mrs. Bryant?

33:39.551 --> 33:41.420
(muttering)

34:04.876 --> 34:06.845
Later.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.115
Later, man.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.521
(garbled radio transmission)

34:15.554 --> 34:16.455
(siren whoops)

34:53.259 --> 34:54.660
Streets are talking, man.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.596
Well, what are they saying?

34:57.629 --> 34:59.598
You ain't hear it from me.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.367
But they saying
it's that kid

35:01.400 --> 35:03.169
that's always hanging
at the center.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.637
Casper.

35:08.474 --> 35:10.276
What?

35:10.309 --> 35:12.478
Li'l Casper.

35:16.448 --> 35:17.549
ANDY:
Sammy?

35:17.583 --> 35:18.817
Sammy, get in the car!

35:18.850 --> 35:20.319
Damn it.

35:21.687 --> 35:22.788
Excuse me.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.205
Hey, you can't
just walk in here...

35:45.644 --> 35:48.247
(sobbing)

35:48.280 --> 35:50.882
I'm sorry!

35:50.916 --> 35:53.585
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

35:53.619 --> 35:56.555
(sobbing)

35:58.757 --> 36:00.526
(yelling and sobbing):
Why?!

36:00.559 --> 36:02.228
I'm sorry!

36:02.261 --> 36:03.595
I'm so sorry!

36:03.629 --> 36:06.565
(sobbing)

36:19.511 --> 36:21.480
I'm sorry.

36:41.633 --> 36:42.868
(sighing)

37:04.623 --> 37:07.559
(sobbing)

37:23.809 --> 37:25.944
It's only 2.5 million so far.

37:25.977 --> 37:29.981
That's probably just Monopoly
money for you, isn't it?

37:30.015 --> 37:33.319
The Assistant Chief,
he knew my name.

37:33.319 --> 37:34.686
He gave me his card

37:34.720 --> 37:36.355
with his private
cell phone number on it.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.724
People are gonna start
knowing your name.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.359
A lot of different units
are gonna be looking for you

37:40.392 --> 37:41.960
once your probation's over.

37:41.993 --> 37:45.331
Special Problems Unit,
GIT, Narco.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.732
This whole place--

37:46.765 --> 37:49.668
it's gonna be wide open
for you.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.737
Just like it was for me.

37:51.770 --> 37:55.841
Half this job is luck.

37:55.874 --> 37:59.345
But you won't stay lucky
unless you stay sharp.

37:59.378 --> 38:00.979
You better enjoy this.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.915
These victories
and good days on the job,

38:03.949 --> 38:06.952
they're far outnumbered
by the bad ones.

38:11.357 --> 38:13.725
I didn't mean to lie
about smoking.

38:13.759 --> 38:16.962
It's just, Sammy, I have
nothing to do out here.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.731
It just gets so frustrating.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.368
And I know I said that I
wouldn't if we got pregnant,

38:22.368 --> 38:24.703
but Sammy, we aren't pregnant.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.872
I got my period this morning

38:26.905 --> 38:29.708
so, I figured it
wouldn't do any harm.

38:29.741 --> 38:32.778
I mean, it was
medical marijuana.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.079
I didn't know
it was that strong.

38:34.112 --> 38:37.983
Look, I know what
that kid looks like.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.786
We can talk to somebody at your
work and maybe make a sketch.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.388
We will get the camera back.

38:42.388 --> 38:43.722
He won't be able to sell it.

38:43.755 --> 38:48.560
And if we don't,
I'll, I'll get a job.

38:48.594 --> 38:49.895
I'll work it out, okay?

38:49.928 --> 38:52.631
I'll get you
the money back, Sammy.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.969
Sammy...

38:58.003 --> 39:00.572
Please talk to me.

39:00.606 --> 39:03.909
Sammy, please, just say
something, anything.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.545
Sammy, please talk to me.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.947
I'm so sorry. Please...

39:08.980 --> 39:12.017
talk to me.

39:12.050 --> 39:15.020
(sobbing)

39:15.053 --> 39:19.124
D.A.:
It's not the work of one
individual, but of a team.

39:19.157 --> 39:22.961
The chief gave me
a list of names.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.996
I would like to
personally thank

39:25.030 --> 39:27.999
Detective Gil Puente,

39:28.033 --> 39:30.769
Detective Danny Salinger,

39:30.802 --> 39:32.904
Detective Nate Moretta...
(sighing)

39:32.938 --> 39:38.610
and patrol officers
John Cooper and Ben Sherman

39:38.644 --> 39:41.913
for their excellent,
heroic service.
The D.A. just said your name.

39:41.947 --> 39:44.450
No longer will the gangsters
operate with impunity.

39:44.450 --> 39:45.851
I think it sounds better
when you say it.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.786
Ben...

39:47.819 --> 39:50.456
Ben.
Mm-hmm.

39:50.489 --> 39:52.658
Ben.

39:52.691 --> 39:55.160
(whispering):
Ben.

39:55.193 --> 39:57.463
(dog barking)

39:57.463 --> 39:59.865
(chuckling)

40:02.768 --> 40:03.835
The king is dead.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.070
Long live the king.

40:05.103 --> 40:06.738
He was a worthy
adversary-- Trinny.

40:06.772 --> 40:08.073
Had a good head
on his shoulders, right?

40:08.106 --> 40:09.475
(laughing)

40:09.508 --> 40:10.709
A head is a terrible
thing to detach.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.010
(laughing)

40:12.043 --> 40:14.680
Yo, the United Negro
College Fund is gonna

40:14.713 --> 40:16.815
Why, you gonna rat me out?
I ain't rattin' you out.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.450
It's all you, man.

40:18.484 --> 40:22.220
Yo, you all right, Sal.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.790
You still tussle
like a little bitch.

40:24.823 --> 40:26.692
Oh, I'm a boxer, okay,
not a wrestler.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.660
Oh, I see.
And you're a D3.

40:28.694 --> 40:30.161
You're playing
that card, huh?
Yeah, I'm playing that card.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.630
I may be crazy,
but I ain't stupid.
All right.

40:31.663 --> 40:32.964
You know, Sal,
we're going to go

40:32.998 --> 40:34.666
to El Cholo's for
enchiladas, bro.

40:34.700 --> 40:38.103
Nah, you guys go ahead
and go without me.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.138
Tomorrow shave that crap off
your face, put on a tie.

40:40.171 --> 40:42.040
All right, you're
back on my table.
Welcome back.

40:42.073 --> 40:44.643
A tie?

40:44.676 --> 40:46.512
So, what do you think, man?

40:46.545 --> 40:48.046
Is this thing really over?

40:48.079 --> 40:49.681
What'd Sal call it?

40:49.715 --> 40:50.916
A Whac-a-Mole?

40:50.949 --> 40:52.818
One goes down, two pop up.

40:52.851 --> 40:55.020
It's never over, man.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.656
It's never over.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.037
The Road, that's a good one.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.705
Do you have a Borders
Rewards card, sir?

41:13.739 --> 41:15.841
No.
Would you like to get one?

41:15.874 --> 41:17.242
Sign up today,
you save 40%.

41:17.275 --> 41:18.910
I don't read much.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.278
Are you sure you
don't want one?

41:20.311 --> 41:21.680
I'm sure I don't.

41:21.713 --> 41:24.082
$19.95.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.752
Just keep it.

41:26.785 --> 41:27.853
Okay.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.223
Thanks.
