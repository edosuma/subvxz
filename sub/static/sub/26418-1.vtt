00:01.871 --> 00:02.741
Previously on Van Helsing...

00:02.785 --> 00:04.047
My name is Dr. Bruce Harrison.

00:04.091 --> 00:06.397
You're trying to isolate
different vampire traits.

00:06.441 --> 00:07.877
Harrison wanted me
to find that book

00:07.920 --> 00:09.487
so that I'd think you were
my mom.

00:09.531 --> 00:10.619
[gun shot]

00:10.662 --> 00:11.837
We'll have your sister
within the day.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.622
I'll never be like you.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.319
[growling]

00:15.363 --> 00:16.886
[Scarlett]: You guys are
gonna go up the mountain.

00:16.929 --> 00:18.105
Meet you at Crooked Falls.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.584
How can you be in the sun
without burning?

00:19.628 --> 00:22.152
[growling]

00:22.196 --> 00:23.806
[explosion]

00:23.849 --> 00:24.720
[Bruce]: We're closing in
on your location now.

00:24.763 --> 00:25.851
Who was that?

00:25.895 --> 00:27.462
These people need me now
more than ever.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.725
Find your daughter
and then I'll find you.

00:29.768 --> 00:30.856
You're my mother?

00:30.900 --> 00:32.728
What is that on your neck?

00:32.771 --> 00:33.903
It's blood from the dark one.

00:33.946 --> 00:34.904
The first.

00:34.947 --> 00:35.948
Ah!

00:37.515 --> 00:39.865
The blood of the first flows
through the sister's veins.

00:39.909 --> 00:44.218
If you were truly bound to me
go find my sister.

00:44.261 --> 00:45.262
Take it.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.395
Don't you leave me again!

00:48.222 --> 00:51.225
[gasps]

00:59.146 --> 01:03.367
[thunder rolls]

01:41.231 --> 01:42.798
Ow!

01:46.149 --> 01:47.977
We'll take that one.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.777
But why did we have
to leave her there?

02:05.821 --> 02:07.910
Why? I don't understand.

02:07.953 --> 02:09.433
Hush now, sweetie. Hush.

02:09.477 --> 02:12.523
It's for the best, Vanessa,
you'll see.

02:12.567 --> 02:15.439
No, no, no, no, no.

02:15.483 --> 02:16.745
Vanessa, please stop.

02:16.788 --> 02:17.876
Your father needs to drive.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.008
He's not my father!
He's not!

02:19.051 --> 02:20.270
He's not!

02:20.314 --> 02:22.751
Goddammit! We're trying
to keep you both alive!

02:22.794 --> 02:24.231
Watch out!!!

02:24.274 --> 02:27.190
[crash]

03:07.578 --> 03:14.324
[inaudible whispers]

03:18.502 --> 03:22.550
[inaudible whispers]

03:48.315 --> 03:51.448
[gasping]

03:59.195 --> 04:00.631
You.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.067
Yes.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.417
It is I.

04:06.028 --> 04:10.293
[fighting grunts]

04:17.605 --> 04:19.128
Mommy?

04:24.089 --> 04:26.222
Listen to me, child.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.877
Your sister sent me to find you.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.009
I did that.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.664
Killed the others.

04:33.708 --> 04:37.015
All of this I did for you.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.286
Stop this.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.765
We don't have much time.

04:47.809 --> 04:50.028
You're not my sister.

04:50.072 --> 04:56.078
[snarling]

04:59.951 --> 05:03.433
Vanessa- Vanessa,
it's me!

05:03.477 --> 05:05.217
Susan!

05:05.261 --> 05:07.219
Susan.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.355
Susan?

05:12.399 --> 05:14.662
Uh-huh.

05:14.705 --> 05:18.448
I've done what I was asked
to do, ok?

05:18.492 --> 05:23.366
I was bound to...

05:23.410 --> 05:27.979
Will you release me now?

05:28.023 --> 05:29.459
That's...

05:32.419 --> 05:35.291
No, no.

05:35.335 --> 05:40.992
If my sister sent you,
then take me to her.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.843
Vanessa?

06:05.887 --> 06:09.325
Scarlett.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.719
What is this?

06:11.762 --> 06:14.548
I have no idea.

06:14.591 --> 06:18.639
There's someone you need
to meet.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.249
Who's that?

06:20.292 --> 06:22.251
You know who it is.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.603
No.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.300
It's me, Essa.

06:29.650 --> 06:34.219
I'm sorry, but it's true.

06:34.263 --> 06:35.438
What is this?

06:35.482 --> 06:36.874
Where are we?

06:36.918 --> 06:39.137
The only place that the elder
could send us.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.270
We don't have much time.

06:41.313 --> 06:43.272
We set it free.

06:43.315 --> 06:46.188
You set it free?
Why would you do that?

06:46.231 --> 06:47.842
Why didn't you kill it?

06:47.885 --> 06:51.454
The elder has pledged
to serve us.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.282
That doesn't make any sense.

06:53.325 --> 06:54.501
Well, I told it to kill Dmitri

06:54.544 --> 06:58.635
and without hesitation
it ripped him apart.

06:58.679 --> 07:01.551
I'm not working
with an elder, ok?

07:01.595 --> 07:02.944
I'm gonna kill it.

07:02.987 --> 07:05.250
That would be a mistake,
sweetie.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.949
Don't call me that.

07:07.992 --> 07:11.343
I'm so sorry, Essa.

07:11.387 --> 07:17.175
I've made sacrifices that
you know nothing about.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.699
Is that right?

07:18.742 --> 07:21.484
That's the fate of being
a Van Helsings.

07:21.528 --> 07:24.574
You were born for sacrifice.

07:24.618 --> 07:30.885
It's true of you and
of Scarlett, as well.

07:30.928 --> 07:37.195
The blood that infected you,
it's from the dark one itself.

07:37.239 --> 07:46.204
There is nothing like it, too...
in this whole world.

07:46.248 --> 07:53.516
But if it ever got free again
there'd be no stopping it.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.170
I'll stop it.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.824
No.

07:56.867 --> 08:03.700
Never face the dark one unless
there's absolutely no other way.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.137
[coughing]

08:11.839 --> 08:15.930
Each elder has something,
a totem,

08:15.973 --> 08:18.498
that leads to the dark one.

08:18.541 --> 08:21.022
Alone they're no good.

08:21.065 --> 08:26.070
Only together
can they release it.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.638
Stop the elders.

08:28.682 --> 08:32.686
Find the totems
and destroy them.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.818
Ok, I- I don't understand.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.690
The book.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.474
The family book.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.782
the answers are in there.

08:41.825 --> 08:44.611
I just couldn't find them.

08:44.654 --> 08:48.049
I read every word.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.138
[coughing]

08:53.620 --> 08:55.447
I don't think she has
a lot of time.

09:03.325 --> 09:07.329
It's now or never, sweetie.

09:07.372 --> 09:09.723
You decide.

09:13.422 --> 09:16.164
[sobbing] I'm sorry.

09:16.207 --> 09:19.820
I'm so, so sorry.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.953
I did the search for years.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.966
Vanessa...

09:37.968 --> 09:39.274
Mom?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.497
Mom?

09:46.411 --> 09:47.630
Mom?

09:56.987 --> 09:59.250
Leave me alone.

10:19.793 --> 10:23.100
Meat for us, and that's just
the beginning,

10:23.144 --> 10:25.668
I promise you.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.104
I hope so.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.280
I know so.

10:29.324 --> 10:32.849
In my heart I know it.

10:32.893 --> 10:38.072
When I was hunting I saw
the tracks of others.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.987
There are a few buildings
in the distance.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.858
Buildings?

10:41.902 --> 10:43.599
And fences around them.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.167
Some kind of prison
or something.

10:46.210 --> 10:51.651
I haven't approached them yet
but it was quiet.

10:51.694 --> 10:54.392
It could be a safe place for us.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.220
A place to start over.

10:56.264 --> 10:59.702
To begin again, and let these
things see

10:59.746 --> 11:02.400
that they haven't beaten us
and they never will.

11:02.444 --> 11:03.314
[All]: Yeah.

11:03.358 --> 11:04.751
You hear me?

11:04.794 --> 11:06.056
Never!

11:06.100 --> 11:07.623
[gasp]

11:14.848 --> 11:16.284
[snap]

11:16.327 --> 11:17.677
Boo!

11:17.720 --> 11:20.157
[screaming]

11:21.768 --> 11:24.074
[snarling]

11:24.814 --> 11:27.469
No, no!

11:27.512 --> 11:30.080
Mohamad, play with them.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.386
[screams]

11:31.429 --> 11:33.170
Play!

11:33.214 --> 11:34.694
[screaming]

11:40.743 --> 11:42.397
Feed.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.355
Feed, now.

11:49.621 --> 11:52.712
He'll learn to play.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.322
He wants to learn.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.889
[cries of pain]

11:55.932 --> 11:59.980
He must learn to play.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.503
He must.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.679
[cries of pain]

12:03.723 --> 12:04.506
Mohamad!

12:04.549 --> 12:05.420
Mohamad!

12:05.463 --> 12:07.378
Look, look!

12:07.422 --> 12:08.249
Look.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.554
Play.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.556
Play.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.428
It's fun, playing. Hmm?

12:17.258 --> 12:18.520
Mohamad.

12:18.563 --> 12:21.218
[snarling]

12:21.262 --> 12:23.743
You'll learn.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.701
You must learn.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.448
Shit.

12:33.491 --> 12:34.579
[helicopters whirring]

12:34.623 --> 12:36.233
They're back, alright.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.279
I was hoping that storm might
hold 'em off but no such luck.

12:38.322 --> 12:40.629
That's like the fifth or sixth
time they've done that

12:40.672 --> 12:42.413
since the snow fell.

12:42.457 --> 12:45.155
Just fly by and not land.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.027
This is so strange.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.942
It's completely healed.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.944
What?

12:50.987 --> 12:54.556
[helicopter whirring]

12:54.599 --> 12:55.775
[sighs]

12:55.818 --> 12:58.038
Axel, what're they doing?

13:00.475 --> 13:02.825
Recon.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.087
What?

13:04.131 --> 13:06.916
Checking us out,
looking for a place to land.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.700
Gauging our forces
before they commit.

13:08.744 --> 13:09.571
Commit?

13:09.614 --> 13:11.616
To what?

13:11.660 --> 13:13.836
I don't know.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.707
It's what I'm afraid of.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.013
Should I contact them again?

13:17.057 --> 13:18.841
[All]: No!

13:21.713 --> 13:23.280
How can you even be sure
it's the same guys?

13:23.324 --> 13:24.716
I'm sure.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.762
Ok, so what do we do now?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.590
We wait. We arm ourselves.

13:28.633 --> 13:29.678
Be ready.

13:29.721 --> 13:30.635
For what?

13:30.679 --> 13:32.202
To be wiped out?

13:32.246 --> 13:33.551
These people are soldiers.

13:33.595 --> 13:34.596
They ain't soldiers.

13:34.639 --> 13:35.727
Well, whatever you wanna
call them,

13:35.771 --> 13:37.164
they have guns and a lot more
than us.

13:37.207 --> 13:38.469
That doesn't make
them soldiers.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.297
It doesn't make us soldiers,
either.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.646
I know that, but-

13:41.690 --> 13:43.083
Why doesn't it make sense
for us to go out there

13:43.126 --> 13:44.519
and wave them down?

13:44.562 --> 13:45.781
We're not saying
with some white flag,

13:45.825 --> 13:47.652
just friendly-like.

13:47.696 --> 13:50.960
To see if the wanna, you know,
discuss this.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.138
Ok, good talk.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.618
Look, you guys want there

13:56.661 --> 13:58.838
to be some kind of magic
solution, right?

13:58.881 --> 14:01.884
A ticket to freedom and sunshine
and all that shit,

14:01.928 --> 14:04.669
but I'm telling you,
this ain't that.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.193
These guys are anything
but that.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.759
How do you know for sure?

14:07.803 --> 14:09.631
Because the last time they could
have held out a hand to us

14:09.674 --> 14:12.895
all friendly-like, they gassed
us and kidnapped our friend.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.331
That's how.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.116
Yeah, but they didn't kill you.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.250
End of discussion.

14:44.709 --> 14:47.234
Don't come any closer.

14:49.149 --> 14:51.107
We must work together now.

14:51.151 --> 14:52.935
I don't have to do anything
so don't tell me I do.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.632
What your mother said,
she was wrong.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.112
Feverish.

14:56.156 --> 14:56.939
Destroy the totem-

14:56.983 --> 14:58.071
Stop!

14:58.114 --> 15:01.161
Don't you ever talk to me
about her.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.250
Vanessa.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.729
I'm here for you.

15:04.773 --> 15:06.557
You must hear my thoughts
and my wisdom.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.342
Just wait.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.692
Just wait.

15:19.179 --> 15:23.357
These other elders,
tell me about them.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.011
Now.

15:25.054 --> 15:29.276
There are others that guard
the pathway to the dark one.

15:29.319 --> 15:34.237
She said that these elders,
that they have some thing.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.717
A totem.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.719
Is that right?

15:37.762 --> 15:39.068
Yes.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.462
So where's yours?

15:41.505 --> 15:43.159
Give it to me.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.988
If you're pledged to us
then give me yours.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.817
I cannot. I do not possess it.

15:48.860 --> 15:52.212
It was taken from me
as I was imprisoned.

15:52.255 --> 15:53.300
Of course it was.

15:53.343 --> 15:54.388
How convenient.

15:54.431 --> 15:55.476
Where are you going?

15:55.519 --> 15:57.391
To get something.

15:57.434 --> 16:01.482
Don't follow me, or I'll throw
you off this á*áá*áing mountain.

16:12.275 --> 16:15.278
[muffled voices]

16:17.585 --> 16:19.065
And with a white flag.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.153
What?

16:22.155 --> 16:23.983
So what're you doing?

16:25.201 --> 16:27.290
If my instincts still work
this guy's here for one thing.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.683
Scarlett.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.032
I can't let her walk
into a trap.

16:30.076 --> 16:31.077
I gotta go find her.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.165
Alright, let's do this.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.209
Woah. Hey, woah.

16:33.253 --> 16:34.428
Be cool.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.908
Seriously,
what're we doing, Axel?

16:36.952 --> 16:40.521
Just keep 'em busy
'til I get back, ok?

17:07.504 --> 17:09.985
So Denver is safe.

17:14.381 --> 17:17.427
We would love to go inside
and talk to the others.

17:17.471 --> 17:18.776
That would be wonderful,
thank you.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.735
Please, lead the way.

17:20.778 --> 17:21.562
Hey!

17:21.605 --> 17:22.302
Hey!

17:22.345 --> 17:23.172
Hi!

17:23.216 --> 17:24.086
Hey!

17:24.130 --> 17:24.913
We're unarmed.

17:24.956 --> 17:25.653
Hey!

17:25.696 --> 17:26.480
Hey!

17:26.523 --> 17:27.307
Welcome.

17:27.350 --> 17:28.308
Are you guys ok?

17:28.351 --> 17:29.613
We don't have any weapons.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.789
I didn't think you guys
would actually come back

17:31.833 --> 17:33.400
after the snow hit.

17:33.443 --> 17:34.792
Hello.

17:34.836 --> 17:37.926
You must be the others
that Jessie and Mr. McGrath

17:37.969 --> 17:39.971
were telling us about.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.625
The others.

17:41.669 --> 17:42.322
Yeah.

17:42.365 --> 17:42.974
Yeah.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.193
Yes.

17:44.237 --> 17:45.586
We were just busy upstairs
making dinner.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.153
We didn't even hear
you finally land,

17:47.196 --> 17:49.677
but here you are.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.461
You must be hungry.

17:51.505 --> 17:52.462
Why don't you come on inside?

17:52.506 --> 17:54.203
Yeah.

17:54.247 --> 18:00.253
[growling]

18:14.919 --> 18:16.921
[coughing]

18:18.619 --> 18:20.882
[coughing]

18:31.762 --> 18:37.116
This man just crawled out
of a grave alive.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.422
Can anyone explain that?

18:39.466 --> 18:40.815
No, but-

18:40.858 --> 18:42.860
I can.

18:42.904 --> 18:46.212
I mean, not medically,
of course,

18:46.255 --> 18:48.910
but uh maybe we could
all go inside-

18:48.953 --> 18:50.955
I'm fine where I am right now,
thank you.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.435
Yes, but we have soup.

18:52.479 --> 18:55.917
By the way, where is Scarlett?

18:58.224 --> 19:00.878
Her and her army man,
where are they?

19:00.922 --> 19:02.924
Hmm?

19:02.967 --> 19:06.145
Are they up there
with guns trained on us?

19:06.188 --> 19:07.668
No.

19:07.711 --> 19:10.801
They're not here right now.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.977
Interesting.

19:13.021 --> 19:18.026
No doubt due to our noisy
fly-bys.

19:18.069 --> 19:20.159
Noisy but necessary.

19:26.948 --> 19:29.385
[screaming]
No!

19:29.429 --> 19:31.735
Noooooo!!!!

19:31.779 --> 19:33.694
Lucky!

19:33.737 --> 19:35.304
No!

19:35.348 --> 19:38.002
[sobbing]

19:38.046 --> 19:40.527
No! No!

20:46.897 --> 20:48.421
No!

20:49.073 --> 20:51.032
No!

20:51.075 --> 20:52.251
It's ok.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.339
No!

20:53.382 --> 20:54.601
Hey, Flesh, look at me.

20:54.644 --> 20:55.732
It's ok, it's ok.

20:55.776 --> 20:56.820
It's ok.

20:56.864 --> 20:58.257
It's ok.

21:01.216 --> 21:02.478
You...

21:07.178 --> 21:10.356
You, you ruined my life again.

21:10.399 --> 21:11.705
And again.

21:12.749 --> 21:15.012
And again!

21:16.536 --> 21:18.799
And now she's gone.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.412
She's gone!

21:25.022 --> 21:27.677
What did he mean by that?

21:27.721 --> 21:28.678
Anyone?

21:28.722 --> 21:29.940
Who the hell knows?

21:29.984 --> 21:31.420
The man is delusional,
can't you see that?

21:31.464 --> 21:33.335
No, I don't know exactly
what I am seeing right now

21:33.379 --> 21:36.338
but I am going to understand,
I am.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.208
Ok, whatever.

21:37.252 --> 21:38.122
The man needs help.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.123
We need to get him help.

21:39.167 --> 21:40.429
Jessie, McGrath- hey.

21:40.473 --> 21:41.517
What was he saying
to you?

21:41.561 --> 21:43.345
Yeah, I...

21:43.389 --> 21:44.868
Lucky!

21:45.782 --> 21:47.001
Lucky!

21:47.044 --> 21:48.524
Flesh, stop.

21:48.568 --> 21:49.612
Stop.

21:49.656 --> 21:50.570
Lucky!

21:50.613 --> 21:51.614
Flesh.

21:51.658 --> 21:52.441
Lucky!

21:52.485 --> 21:53.703
Flesh, stop!

21:53.747 --> 21:54.530
Lucky!

21:54.574 --> 21:55.618
Flesh-

21:55.662 --> 21:56.793
Lucky!

21:56.837 --> 21:58.186
Stop! There's nothing left
of her, ok?

21:58.229 --> 21:59.318
No!

21:59.361 --> 22:00.188
Flesh, just-

22:00.231 --> 22:02.233
Take them. Now.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.193
[grunts]

22:05.802 --> 22:07.413
[dog barking]

22:09.197 --> 22:10.198
[dog barking]

22:11.504 --> 22:13.941
Now that we all have our hello's
out of the way.

22:13.984 --> 22:16.900
Let's go inside and talk,
shall we?

22:16.944 --> 22:19.512
Someone shoot
that á*áá*áing dog.

22:25.909 --> 22:28.695
[dog barking]

22:39.140 --> 22:40.620
[barking]

22:56.592 --> 22:58.464
Abigail.

23:21.312 --> 23:24.794
I know that you all have a lot
of questions and are scared

23:24.838 --> 23:27.406
and honestly...

23:30.496 --> 23:31.888
I don't care.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.849
So here's what we're gonna do.

23:35.892 --> 23:38.286
I'm going to ask
my next question

23:38.329 --> 23:41.245
and then we're gonna take
a bathroom break

23:41.289 --> 23:43.073
and get you a cup of coffee.

23:43.117 --> 23:45.293
You can think about it.

23:46.816 --> 23:48.949
Because I promise you,

23:48.992 --> 23:52.822
you will not like what happens
the next time I ask it.

23:54.433 --> 23:59.046
Where is Scarlett?

24:30.251 --> 24:32.514
[snarling]

24:32.558 --> 24:36.692
[growling]

25:09.159 --> 25:10.030
Hey.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.031
Ok, ok, ok.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.598
Don't sneak up on me
like that!

25:12.641 --> 25:16.210
Well, you shouldn't sneak out
on a guy without saying goodbye.

25:16.253 --> 25:17.733
I'm sorry.

25:19.343 --> 25:21.128
I had to go.

25:21.171 --> 25:22.608
Seriously?

25:22.651 --> 25:25.654
I go out for a cigarette
and just poof, bam, you're gone?

25:25.698 --> 25:27.134
I mean it, I really had to go.

25:27.177 --> 25:29.005
Because of Abby.

25:29.049 --> 25:31.573
There's so much more to say
about it, but...

25:31.617 --> 25:34.837
she was my mother.

25:34.881 --> 25:36.883
The boss?

25:36.926 --> 25:38.014
Seriously?

25:38.058 --> 25:39.233
Yeah.

25:39.276 --> 25:42.018
What do you mean was?
Where is she?

25:45.892 --> 25:48.547
Oh, Jesus.

25:48.590 --> 25:49.983
Yeah.

25:55.075 --> 25:58.687
I missed you.

25:58.731 --> 26:01.995
I missed you, too.

26:02.038 --> 26:04.606
I need you.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.869
I feel the same.

26:06.913 --> 26:08.305
And in that way, too.

26:08.349 --> 26:10.046
But I need you down the hill.

26:10.090 --> 26:12.962
What?

26:13.006 --> 26:15.791
We got problems.

26:15.835 --> 26:20.317
Ok, um... what about Scarhead
and them, something's happening?

26:20.361 --> 26:21.536
Yeah, well...

26:21.580 --> 26:22.406
They're changing.
They're transforming.

26:22.450 --> 26:23.756
They're gonna have to wait.

26:23.799 --> 26:24.713
We got bigger problems down
at Crooked Falls.

26:24.757 --> 26:27.020
What's bigger than this?

26:27.063 --> 26:28.761
We gotta go.

26:30.893 --> 26:32.634
Alright, army man.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.117
Marine.

26:39.467 --> 26:40.686
I'm a marine.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.653
No.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.612
No animal.

27:04.579 --> 27:07.321
There is nothing else.

27:07.364 --> 27:10.063
You must feed, must.

27:10.106 --> 27:13.762
It must be human.

27:13.806 --> 27:15.895
Only human.

27:18.506 --> 27:19.420
No!

27:19.463 --> 27:20.595
No.

27:20.639 --> 27:21.248
No.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.337
Stop!

27:23.380 --> 27:25.382
Keep looking!

27:31.650 --> 27:33.956
[screaming]

27:35.741 --> 27:37.264
[screaming]

27:38.352 --> 27:39.962
Go!

27:44.271 --> 27:45.794
Now, remember.

27:45.838 --> 27:51.495
I told you you wouldn't want me
asking my questions again.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.889
I... I told you that.

27:53.933 --> 27:54.934
Hmm?

27:54.977 --> 27:56.718
Correct?

27:56.762 --> 27:58.720
Good.

27:58.764 --> 28:01.549
I wanted to make sure
that my message

28:01.592 --> 28:04.552
had resonated with you all.

28:04.595 --> 28:06.249
Made sense.

28:11.559 --> 28:12.995
I thought maybe it hadn't
since none of you

28:13.039 --> 28:15.432
had said anything yet.

28:20.394 --> 28:22.483
Ok, we really don't know
where she went!

28:25.138 --> 28:26.313
She left here with the boss

28:26.356 --> 28:27.749
and we don't know
where they were going.

28:27.793 --> 28:28.968
Wait, who are you
talking about?

28:29.011 --> 28:30.230
The boss?

28:30.273 --> 28:32.101
Our leader. Abby.

28:32.145 --> 28:33.059
She's just a doctor but-

28:33.102 --> 28:34.756
Yes.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.889
Abby.

28:36.932 --> 28:37.977
Go on.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.369
Jessie, don't.

28:39.413 --> 28:40.675
Stop talking.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.765
Don't say anymore, Jessie.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.506
[cries out]

28:45.549 --> 28:47.726
[sobbing]

28:47.769 --> 28:48.944
[sighs]

28:50.206 --> 28:51.686
Sorry, you were saying?

28:53.514 --> 28:55.516
[gasping]

29:03.002 --> 29:06.657
Well, well, what do
we have here?

29:14.883 --> 29:17.799
Why is this happening to you?

29:17.843 --> 29:20.541
Why are you healing so rapidly?

29:20.584 --> 29:23.239
I don't know.

29:23.283 --> 29:26.242
But there's a new type
of vampire out there

29:26.286 --> 29:27.548
and they did this to me.

29:27.591 --> 29:28.549
New type?

29:28.592 --> 29:29.855
Yeah.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.682
One with a scar. He did it.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.815
Scar? What scar?

29:33.859 --> 29:36.818
A big ugly scar.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.602
We call 'em day-walkers.

29:38.646 --> 29:43.259
See, they can be out
in the day under the sun

29:43.303 --> 29:46.349
and not burn at all.

29:50.223 --> 29:52.355
And this didn't turn you?

29:52.399 --> 29:54.444
Not even his bite?

29:54.488 --> 29:55.924
No.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.715
My creature's still alive.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.935
Your creature?

30:06.979 --> 30:09.895
You mean you're the one
who created that thing?

30:11.940 --> 30:13.246
Why?

30:16.597 --> 30:18.686
Because I could.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.517
Well, well, well.

30:25.301 --> 30:27.216
Hello again, mother.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.783
I almost made it.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.872
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

30:30.916 --> 30:34.354
You almost made it.

30:34.397 --> 30:37.270
You're doomed now.

30:37.313 --> 30:39.402
You've released an elder.

30:39.446 --> 30:41.187
Beginning of the end.

30:41.230 --> 30:44.930
I don't think you know shit,
Abigail,

30:44.973 --> 30:46.627
or whatever your name is.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.324
I know that much.

30:48.368 --> 30:50.196
Mark my words.

30:50.239 --> 30:54.026
Choose them wisely,

30:54.069 --> 30:56.202
because they're the last words
you're ever gonna say.

30:56.245 --> 31:00.075
Still just a bitter little girl,
aren't you?

31:00.119 --> 31:03.122
Blaming the world for your
mommy running out on you.

31:03.165 --> 31:04.340
Is that it?

31:04.384 --> 31:06.386
Are those the last words
you're gonna say?
