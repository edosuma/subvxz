00:46.246 --> 00:48.080
Baird.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.114
Baird!

00:49.116 --> 00:50.482
( Swords clanging )

00:50.484 --> 00:52.217
Baird!

00:53.253 --> 00:54.386
You lose focus?

00:54.388 --> 00:55.621
I'm fine.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.189
Jones, what's holding you up?

00:57.191 --> 00:59.091
I'm sorry, I assume you
don't want

00:59.093 --> 01:01.660
the ancient death trap to drop
a thousand tons of rocks on us!

01:01.662 --> 01:03.295
Or I could rush if you like.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.629
Okay. The mathematical
combination

01:04.632 --> 01:06.231
is based on these hieroglyphs.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.533
How many base symbols are there?

01:07.535 --> 01:10.836
There's 24, old
and new kingdoms!

01:10.838 --> 01:12.204
Where is he?

01:12.206 --> 01:13.705
Ezekiel, turn the gear
twice clockwise,

01:13.707 --> 01:18.477
and then the cycles of the sun,
divided by golden ratios,

01:18.479 --> 01:20.612
height of the pyramid,

01:20.614 --> 01:24.516
then three times
counter clockwise.

01:24.518 --> 01:25.617
( Clattering )

01:25.619 --> 01:26.618
Hah!

01:26.620 --> 01:28.454
Now solve our mummy problem!

01:28.456 --> 01:29.621
Are you sure that he said...

01:29.623 --> 01:31.223
Message said to meet him here,

01:31.225 --> 01:33.325
he did not mention the mummies!

01:35.095 --> 01:38.564
Remove the medallions
and the mummies fall.

01:38.566 --> 01:41.433
He didn't mention
the mummies or the medallions.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.336
Stone, Cassandra, Ezekiel,

01:44.338 --> 01:45.537
did I not mention the mummies

01:45.539 --> 01:47.139
nor the medallions in my message

01:47.141 --> 01:48.574
to meet me at
the monolith of mut?

01:48.576 --> 01:50.676
Nope.
Next time, mummy memo.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.511
Hello, librarian.

01:52.513 --> 01:53.745
Hello, guardian.

01:53.747 --> 01:57.216
- You came back alive.
- So I did.

01:57.218 --> 02:01.320
Not that I don't enjoy a bit of classic
tomb robbing, but why are we here?

02:01.322 --> 02:03.889
Because I believe that this
sarcophagus holds the key.

02:05.391 --> 02:08.327
And I believe that
I have found a way

02:08.329 --> 02:10.729
to bring back the library.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.644
The theory that the pharaohs
used zero point energy

02:25.646 --> 02:27.813
to construct the pyramids
is not, new of course.

02:27.815 --> 02:28.881
Of course.

02:28.883 --> 02:30.249
- Is that sarcasm?
- No.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.416
That was sarcasm.

02:31.418 --> 02:32.417
Not if the first one wasn't.

02:32.419 --> 02:33.719
I've missed you.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.787
Thank you for not
changing anything.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.423
Actually, I'd love to but
the annex keeps resetting it

02:38.425 --> 02:40.792
to your preferences like
I don't even exist.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.628
Well, that's odd, it should
adjust to your presences.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.496
Ah, here we go.

02:44.498 --> 02:49.234
References to the pyramids as
passageways to the afterlife.

02:49.236 --> 02:50.636
Not so metaphorical
perhaps, Jenkins?

02:50.638 --> 02:51.937
Perhaps sir.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.539
Are you thinking
there's an actual doorway

02:53.541 --> 02:54.840
to heaven in the pyramids?

02:54.842 --> 02:56.375
I mean, I think we would
have found it by now.

02:56.377 --> 03:00.312
Well, sympathetic magic.
Not a literal doorway.

03:00.314 --> 03:03.182
A doorway like ours, an
interdimensional doorway.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.583
Well, that makes sense because
the pyramids were designed

03:04.585 --> 03:07.352
along precise
mathematical lines.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.656
If the stones are resonant
to certain energy wavelengths

03:10.658 --> 03:14.893
along the magical spectrum
they act as lenses of focuses,

03:14.895 --> 03:17.296
foci along the three dimensions,

03:17.298 --> 03:18.664
dimension infinite,

03:18.666 --> 03:20.933
infinity-- infinite.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.367
Cassandra.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.536
- Infini-- huh!
- No, no, no, no.

03:24.538 --> 03:28.373
I saw it all, I saw it
all the way down,

03:28.375 --> 03:31.410
ow, I can't--
I can't do this math,

03:31.412 --> 03:32.644
the interdimensional
space is too big,

03:32.646 --> 03:35.948
even bigger than
the labyrinth was.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.383
That hasn't happened in a while.

03:39.786 --> 03:41.787
Stupid brain grape.

03:41.789 --> 03:45.524
A series of coordinates,
the energy equation

03:45.526 --> 03:49.294
leading to where--

03:49.296 --> 03:50.529
this, this leads to the void.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.965
The space between dimensions.

03:52.967 --> 03:55.500
The exact space where
the library now floats

03:55.502 --> 03:56.868
cut off from the real world.

03:56.870 --> 04:00.706
If I can open that door,
I could find the library.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.475
I can anchor it back to here,
back to this annex.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.777
Yeah, well, but sadly, you
lack the power generated

04:05.779 --> 04:09.481
by millions of tons of
finely balanced magical stones

04:09.483 --> 04:12.451
placed directly under
intersecting ley lines.

04:12.453 --> 04:16.588
This process couldn't possibly work
without a pyramid to power it.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.827
Unless I can find some sort
of reality-altering guide

04:21.829 --> 04:25.330
linked to a dimensional
shifting device

04:25.332 --> 04:26.865
along with, so we don't melt

04:26.867 --> 04:28.667
Cassandra's brain doing
mathematical equations,

04:28.669 --> 04:30.936
some kind of software
that interfaces with magic.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.437
Do you have anything
like that lying around?

04:32.439 --> 04:35.874
Actually,
here's something funny.

04:37.510 --> 04:41.380
( Electronic beeping )

04:41.382 --> 04:44.516
A reality-altering storybook
to power the magic.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.786
And the software--
Morgan le fay, really?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.588
Ooh.

04:49.590 --> 04:53.625
We never did have
that conversation.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.927
And from the brilliant mind
of Nikola Tesla,

04:55.929 --> 04:58.330
a dimensional stabilizer.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.932
And the ball of twine from
the labyrinth of the minotaur.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.568
The clipping book sent you
all to get these things.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.570
Almost as if it was fate.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.072
It was a little
more complicated than that.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.007
Listen, I don't think
we'll need the thread,

05:09.009 --> 05:10.876
this should work exactly
as it is.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.979
We have power, focus, effect.

05:13.981 --> 05:14.980
Librarian.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.548
Yup.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.749
Coordinates, please,
from the sarcophagus.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.618
Excuse me.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.820
Ahem.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.790
Om... pa...

05:26.059 --> 05:28.927
Ra... set.

05:30.096 --> 05:31.730
Hmm, nothing?

05:31.732 --> 05:33.432
It's a story book.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.534
You can't just feed it numbers.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.603
Ah!

05:38.605 --> 05:42.441
Be my guest.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.476
- Go on.
- One--

05:44.478 --> 05:48.113
once upon a time,
there was a very annoying...

05:48.115 --> 05:50.082
- Dashing.
- ...Librarian

05:50.084 --> 05:54.686
who wanted to open a door to...

05:54.688 --> 05:56.388
His home.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.927
Getting some real power here.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.508
Jenkins, you're a genius.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.143
One is aware, sir.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.846
The librarian and
his friends used the door

06:20.848 --> 06:25.016
to open a path to
a place they had lost.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.786
Your notes were spot on!

06:27.788 --> 06:30.522
Notes?

06:30.524 --> 06:33.925
About the pyramids
that you sent me.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.562
I didn't send any notes.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.098
( Steam hissing )

06:41.768 --> 06:43.068
( Coughing )

06:50.643 --> 06:53.011
But then a hero arrived,

06:53.013 --> 06:55.414
to set the world right.

06:55.416 --> 06:58.550
( Coughs ) Dulaque.

06:58.552 --> 07:03.889
Thanks to the hard work
those librarians did for him.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.027
I didn't want
to use this option.

07:09.029 --> 07:13.765
It doesn't just change
this world, it ends it.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.135
You'll never get the library.

07:17.137 --> 07:20.071
I'm not thinking that small.

07:20.073 --> 07:23.575
A bit more power to lock
in the destination.

07:26.646 --> 07:29.948
I need blood sacrifice.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.491
( Gasps )

07:47.099 --> 07:49.835
I loved you.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.740
Unfortunately,
that was required.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.945
"And so with blood,

07:59.947 --> 08:04.115
passage was opened
to the loom of fate."

08:09.722 --> 08:11.122
( Coughs )

08:13.259 --> 08:17.095
A river and a loom.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.698
It's the river of time
and the loom of...

08:19.700 --> 08:23.068
Here, it all went wrong here.

08:23.070 --> 08:26.905
Eve, don't let him
cut the fabric.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.140
When Camelot fell.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.544
( Rumbling )

08:37.283 --> 08:39.251
If history ends there...

08:41.587 --> 08:43.655
Then I am...

08:50.963 --> 08:52.564
( Gags )

08:54.200 --> 08:56.268
Flynn?

08:56.270 --> 08:57.269
Flynn.

08:57.271 --> 08:58.870
Stop or I shoot.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.171
Flynn, where are we?

09:00.173 --> 09:01.806
What happened to your clothes?

09:01.808 --> 09:03.308
( Coughing )

09:03.310 --> 09:08.980
Hands on your head, now.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.249
Turn around.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.585
Turn around.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.654
Move.

09:17.089 --> 09:18.857
Who is this guy?

09:18.859 --> 09:20.759
Who are you?

09:20.761 --> 09:22.327
( Coughing )

09:29.702 --> 09:31.970
You are in charge?

09:31.972 --> 09:34.873
I am professor carsen,
and I am in charge,

09:34.875 --> 09:37.609
not real-- I--
I'm in charge of the dig.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.245
I have a lot of responsibility.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.948
I'm more of a supervisor
kind of slash.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.583
Professor of what?

09:44.585 --> 09:46.117
That is a fascinating story.

09:46.119 --> 09:49.321
I actually hold the record
in phds, more of a student

09:49.323 --> 09:51.756
of learning than any kind
of discipline or doctrine.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.358
But I like to think
of myself as more of--

09:53.360 --> 09:56.695
( stammers )
I may.. Stop talking.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.297
This area is closed
to all foreigners

09:59.299 --> 10:02.300
while the border dispute
is resolved!

10:02.302 --> 10:03.902
Papers!

10:03.904 --> 10:07.939
Give me your papers.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.841
We're not together
by the way. I don't--

10:09.843 --> 10:11.076
shut up.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.811
A professor.
Are you kidding me?

10:12.813 --> 10:14.112
I'm not even supposed
to be here.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.814
- I never leave the university.
- A professor?

10:15.816 --> 10:17.349
They didn't think I would.
It was kind of a bet that...

10:17.351 --> 10:19.050
- You are not...
- "You won't go into the field

10:19.052 --> 10:20.685
and get your hands dirty Flynn,"
I said, "I'll do it."

10:20.687 --> 10:21.987
They said, "you have allergies.
And you won't..."

10:21.989 --> 10:25.023
- NATO! Western spy!
- Oh, crap.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.291
Get up.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.093
You come with me.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.995
- Hey!
- Shut up.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.897
Let her-- let her go.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.966
I said let her go.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.701
( Groans )

10:38.104 --> 10:40.038
- ( Hammer clicks )
- don't move.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.376
Flynn, wake up.
Listen to me.

10:44.378 --> 10:45.744
You are not a professor.

10:45.746 --> 10:49.648
Aah!

10:49.650 --> 10:51.816
( Gunfire )

10:59.191 --> 11:04.329
That-- who-- how did--
who are you?

11:04.331 --> 11:06.031
I'm the librarian.

11:06.033 --> 11:09.300
Librarian?
Barbarian.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.269
Eve.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.807
The hell?

11:19.845 --> 11:22.280
Nope, nope, nope.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.715
Eve.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.016
Nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.718
Eve!

11:26.720 --> 11:28.219
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Flynn carsen by the way.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.387
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.722
- Hi.
- Thank you.

11:32.324 --> 11:34.059
Come on, you got to get
to a cease fire zone.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.460
More troops are coming. Go.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.461
Why would you still
have researchers here?

11:36.463 --> 11:38.430
Warzones are very dangerous.

11:38.432 --> 11:40.432
Where there's very interesting
ancient goth marking stones

11:40.434 --> 11:41.433
just down the road that I can
at least use to my dissertation.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.234
Wait, what?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.070
No, mystical stones, go back to
that directly under ley lines.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.137
That's what I'm looking for.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.739
- Ley lines?
- Show me.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.307
- Show me the way.
- No such thing as magic.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.242
Show you, that sounds-- what
would the expression be...

11:51.244 --> 11:53.078
Very dangerous.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.480
No, I will point the direction
and I will take this truck.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.916
- Nice to meet you, folks.
- You're not going anywhere.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.185
I'm not the adventurist type.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.486
- Shhh.
- I'm a student of learning.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.054
- Not now.
- I...

12:03.056 --> 12:04.089
You're the librarian?

12:04.091 --> 12:05.423
Yeah, going on 10 years.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.858
How are you here?

12:06.860 --> 12:08.059
I'm the guardian.

12:08.061 --> 12:11.296
Eve, you're dead.
I watched you die.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.965
Being a student of learning,
one of the things that I...

12:13.967 --> 12:15.366
Okay. Is this gonna be a thing?
Because if so,

12:15.368 --> 12:16.401
I'm just gonna nip
it in the bud right now.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.002
I tend to be very methodical.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.404
Maybe I can help
establish your hypothesis.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.939
Who exactly do you think he is?

12:20.941 --> 12:22.373
Jacob stone, recent librarian.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.409
No, I'm the librarian
for over 10 years.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.911
- Okay?
- The other guy died. Well, he faked his death

12:26.913 --> 12:28.513
- but I took the job.
- At the metropolitan library?

12:28.515 --> 12:30.415
- Yes.
- Metropolitan library?

12:30.417 --> 12:33.251
Aah, well, I was offered a job
there once but I never showed up.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.986
Yes.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.255
Where I'm from--
when I'm from, whatever.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.124
He's you.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.458
I mean-- I mean, you're you,
but he's the librarian

12:40.460 --> 12:42.193
and I'm his guardian.

12:43.863 --> 12:46.798
You were my guardian,
almost 10 years ago,

12:46.800 --> 12:49.801
right after your military
intelligence training.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.171
( Gunfire )

12:53.173 --> 12:54.873
Show me the stones, stones,
where are the stones?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.975
- This way?
- Ah...

12:56.977 --> 13:01.379
( Panting )

13:01.381 --> 13:04.816
Oh, man, me, you?
I don't think so.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.551
This job seems to involve
an awful lot of running.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.353
You get used to it.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.221
Hey.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.856
How did I die?

13:11.858 --> 13:14.125
I've seen these stones before.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.360
I've seen them in south America,

13:15.362 --> 13:16.561
I saw them in Egypt.

13:16.563 --> 13:20.565
Stone.
Jacob, please.

13:23.402 --> 13:26.871
You stopped dulaque from
stealing the library, okay?

13:26.873 --> 13:29.040
Charlene and judson,
they threw the library

13:29.042 --> 13:33.077
into another dimension
and you were stabbed.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.280
You bled out in my arms.

13:35.282 --> 13:38.583
That's my version too except
for the part where I died.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.819
The Excalibur,
Buckingham Palace...

13:40.821 --> 13:42.187
No, but I stopped them though.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.289
Okay, it may have been
too late but I stopped them.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.423
You're too late?

13:45.425 --> 13:46.424
There's magic in the world.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.359
No such thing as magic.

13:48.361 --> 13:51.029
Without the serpent brotherhood's
control, it's wild magic.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.397
All right?

13:52.399 --> 13:54.332
Technology's failing,
the monsters are rising,

13:54.334 --> 13:55.600
wars are breaking out.

13:55.602 --> 13:58.069
The best I can do is
hunt down magical items,

13:58.071 --> 13:59.871
like these stones,
and keep them safe

13:59.873 --> 14:01.039
out of the wrong hands.

14:01.041 --> 14:04.075
These are not
the right kind of trees.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.543
What?

14:05.545 --> 14:07.612
I'm just saying that
the actual native specie

14:07.614 --> 14:09.881
of tree on this side of
the Ukraine would be the oak

14:09.883 --> 14:14.285
or the hornbeam but these pine
trees are totally out of place.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.120
I wouldn't have spotted that.

14:16.122 --> 14:19.290
Yeah, I'm art and history
and stuff, I mean, you know,

14:19.292 --> 14:23.261
anyway that you being here, you
spotting that, that's like...

14:23.263 --> 14:25.029
Fate.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.098
That's like fate.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.501
Here. I came in
right through here.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.871
These pine trees actually
form kind of a pattern

14:32.873 --> 14:37.375
around the stones and there's an
ancient metal spike in each one.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.645
Resonance.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.114
That's to activate
the teleportation stones.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.250
There's no such thing
as teleportation.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.252
- ( Gunfire )
- Ah!

14:47.254 --> 14:50.588
I'd be very interested in the
concept of teleportation right now.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.361
( Reverberation )

14:56.363 --> 15:00.031
Oh, self-reinforcing
harmonic resonance?

15:00.033 --> 15:01.299
Whoa.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.067
I told you I knew
what these stones were.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.569
Get in there, now.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.971
You guys must have come
from a different timeline.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.440
For some reason, you guys
keep getting dragged

15:09.442 --> 15:14.412
into the weak spots in reality.

15:14.414 --> 15:19.317
Ah, teleportation stones
under ley lines, that counts.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.952
- Come with us!
- Us? What do you mean us?

15:20.954 --> 15:23.221
No way, no, where are we going?

15:23.223 --> 15:24.289
I can't.
I got to stay here.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.957
I got to power these things up.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.960
If I get these right,
I can send you guys back.

15:33.599 --> 15:37.068
Hey, in your world,

15:37.070 --> 15:39.971
we didn't have our 10 years.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.407
We just met a few months ago.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.509
We're friends, though.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.978
Despite ourselves, sometimes.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.647
Then the alternate me is an ass,

15:49.649 --> 15:51.516
because I missed you, Eve.

15:56.221 --> 16:00.658
Stone, they'll kill you.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.126
Let them try.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.461
Hands on your head.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.430
I'm the librarian.

16:10.736 --> 16:14.706
Whoa, we just teleported.

16:14.708 --> 16:18.710
We just-- using extra
physical means, we somehow--

16:18.712 --> 16:23.414
we accessed the concept of quantum
tunneling on a macro-scale!

16:23.416 --> 16:25.483
You mean magic, mate.

16:27.586 --> 16:29.687
( Gasps )

16:29.689 --> 16:31.422
Hi.

16:31.424 --> 16:35.059
We're on an adventure
or I've lost my mind.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.494
Or both.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.162
Who are you?

16:38.164 --> 16:40.698
I'm the librarian.

16:42.468 --> 16:44.369
Sideways, actually...

16:44.371 --> 16:46.471
I think you're moving sideways
between different timelines,

16:46.473 --> 16:47.672
each one with a
minor difference.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.007
Not so minor.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.241
Wait, are you saying
that we're--

16:50.243 --> 16:51.576
I'm in a parallel universe?

16:51.578 --> 16:54.078
Wait, is there a me here?

16:54.080 --> 16:55.413
Theoretically.

16:55.415 --> 16:58.182
If I-- if I met myself,
would I explode?

16:58.184 --> 17:01.552
Do you have a pen?

17:01.554 --> 17:03.721
And me?

17:03.723 --> 17:06.391
Please don't tell me
we're involved.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.259
What?
No, no, no, no.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.327
Oh, thank god.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.229
You were like a mother to me.

17:11.231 --> 17:14.464
Wait, what? No, that's
mathematically improbable.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.767
Actually, that's not true.

17:15.769 --> 17:18.202
Actually, that's not helping.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.405
"Were," why past tense?

17:20.406 --> 17:22.473
Tore me up.

17:22.474 --> 17:26.377
You became my guardian
when I was a teenager.

17:27.679 --> 17:31.115
When you were stabbed,
the day dulaque

17:31.117 --> 17:35.553
tried to grab the library,
it was the day you died.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.822
Worst day of my life.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.660
Not to look a gift guardian
in the mouth,

17:42.662 --> 17:45.296
but maybe you can help us
with our ghost problem.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.231
Ghosts aren't really
the librarian's job.

17:47.233 --> 17:51.302
Well, they are now.

17:51.304 --> 17:52.837
Welcome to ghost world.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.839
There was a house,
it granted wishes...

17:54.841 --> 17:56.641
Oh, killer from the past.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.643
Didn't put her down quite right.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.378
Her last wish opened
a hole in the world,

18:00.380 --> 18:01.379
and let in all the...

18:01.381 --> 18:02.647
Ghosts?

18:02.649 --> 18:04.649
You're saying those are ghosts?

18:04.651 --> 18:07.418
Real people, possessed.
Most of the world now.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.087
Just my team left.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.790
He's not taking this very well.

18:12.792 --> 18:13.858
Who is he?

18:13.860 --> 18:16.227
The librarian.

18:16.229 --> 18:20.598
The way my year's been going,
he's welcome to the job.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.334
Sod off, deadites!

18:23.336 --> 18:24.735
( Moaning )

18:26.538 --> 18:28.239
No, no, no, no, no.
This is not happening.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.607
Yes, yes, yes, it's happening.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.742
- This is not happening.
- Oh, it's happening.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.511
- Not happening! Why are you so calm?
- Yes, it's happening.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.746
Because I've had some experience
with the weird lately.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.416
Although, apparently
not the 10 years of experience

18:38.418 --> 18:39.750
I've had in these
other timelines.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.552
What is a librarian?

18:41.554 --> 18:44.889
They're the ones who protect
the rest of us

18:44.891 --> 18:46.624
from the magic and the weird

18:46.626 --> 18:48.826
and the things
that go bump in the night.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.394
What's a guardian?

18:50.396 --> 18:52.196
We are the ones
who protect the librarian.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.565
- And die?
- Apparently.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.868
And that doesn't freak you out?
I'm totally freaked out.

18:56.870 --> 18:59.437
Why didn't you answer the letter
about the job in the library?

18:59.439 --> 19:01.305
Did somebody interfere?

19:01.307 --> 19:04.876
No, no, I just--
I know myself.

19:04.878 --> 19:08.146
I was comfortable in
the university so I didn't go.

19:08.148 --> 19:11.682
It was just a-- it was a twist of a
thread on a random loom of fate.

19:17.823 --> 19:21.325
Why did you say loom of fate?

19:21.327 --> 19:23.928
Because it's a Greek myth,
not just a Greek myth,

19:23.930 --> 19:25.930
it's also a baltic myth,
it's also a Finnish myth

19:25.932 --> 19:28.166
- if you want to be technical...
- Skip, skip, skip.

19:28.168 --> 19:31.169
All of our lives,
all of our possibilities.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.171
All of our choices,
are all woven together

19:33.173 --> 19:35.173
in the fabric of a history
on the loom of fate.

19:35.175 --> 19:38.209
He cut it.
He cut the fabric.

19:38.211 --> 19:42.180
And when he cut the fabric,
he cut history.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.414
( Glass shatters )

19:43.416 --> 19:45.449
( Screams )

19:45.451 --> 19:47.485
I guess we should see
what that is.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.187
You're the librarian,
even if you don't know it.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.656
You're the librarian.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.534
( Moaning )

20:05.737 --> 20:07.738
Mr. Jones, they're through!

20:07.740 --> 20:09.373
I will take any ideas.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.210
Any ideas?
The odic force.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.844
The odic force?

20:13.846 --> 20:17.682
Ah, modulate your power output
to 53% and at the same time,

20:17.684 --> 20:20.952
see if you can raise it into the
clevenger field effector range.

20:20.954 --> 20:21.953
He's not making any sense.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.754
It's a good thing.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.290
Clevenger field is where researchers
think telepathy occurs.

20:26.292 --> 20:29.227
Right. Yes. Can you see
what he's thinking?

20:29.229 --> 20:30.628
That's a little bit
of a telepathy joke.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.231
Anyway, assuming
that magic is real,

20:33.233 --> 20:34.665
and I'm not assuming
that magic is real.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.467
But it might be real
in this reality,

20:36.469 --> 20:38.769
what you have is
a spirit energy overlay.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.439
The odic force is sort of
a discarded theory

20:41.441 --> 20:43.708
from the 1800s having to do
with supernatural energy.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.776
And I did a paper on it once.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.311
I got a b+ on it.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.247
That was also not
a very good day.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.681
Wouldn't know about that, mate.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.350
Tech and security's
more my thing, not...

20:52.352 --> 20:53.618
Right.
Not history.

20:53.620 --> 20:57.788
You have a blind spot
that he filled.

20:57.790 --> 21:01.659
All right, team Jones,
do as this man tells you to.

21:03.562 --> 21:04.929
Team Jones, give me
your shoe laces.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.531
Are you kidding me?

21:07.533 --> 21:09.433
Team Jones?

21:09.435 --> 21:11.702
Yeah, well, when I made the librarian
job more technology-oriented,

21:11.704 --> 21:13.004
it made sense to crowd source,

21:13.006 --> 21:14.538
so I opened up
some new franchises,

21:14.540 --> 21:15.873
and sold consulting...

21:15.875 --> 21:18.643
You made a profit
off being a librarian?

21:18.645 --> 21:20.678
I've seen that look before.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.380
( Electricity sparking )

21:22.382 --> 21:23.848
Some things never change.

21:29.721 --> 21:31.489
( Moaning )

21:52.444 --> 21:55.980
( Cheering )

21:57.749 --> 21:59.784
I want full data
on that energy spike.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.485
Well done, librarian.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.820
- What...
- You just saved the world with magic.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.455
I don't know about that.

22:04.457 --> 22:06.557
More of a misunderstood
mathematics, I think.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.526
It's magic, mate.
You're a librarian.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.728
It will grow on you.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.397
Let's set up a containment field, I
want some sort of portable system.

22:13.399 --> 22:14.832
What the hell?

22:14.834 --> 22:18.469
We just disrupted the local
supernatural energy field.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.004
No. No, we're hopping
timelines magically.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.672
I'm not convinced that
that's what's happening.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.442
- Okay, but if we were...
- Which we are not.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.476
- We're unstable.
- I'm not feeling unstable.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.577
I'm feeling unwell.

22:26.579 --> 22:29.347
Ah, for what it's worth,

22:29.349 --> 22:30.948
it was good to see you
again, colonel baird.

22:30.950 --> 22:34.085
And thanks for
bringing him along too.

22:34.087 --> 22:35.453
You two arriving just in time.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.888
Just like it was fate.

22:40.892 --> 22:43.127
What is that smell?

22:43.129 --> 22:44.795
Ooh, that is sulfur.

22:44.797 --> 22:47.398
( Coughs )
Mixed with some kind of ash.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.733
Ugh.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.401
It's not chemical though.
That some...

22:50.403 --> 22:52.370
( Screeching )

22:53.772 --> 22:54.872
That's a dragon.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.975
No shit.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.144
I officially believe
in magic now.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.713
No, we got rid of those.
You and I.

23:02.715 --> 23:03.714
We got rid of those.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.049
Ah!

23:05.051 --> 23:08.085
Ah, ugh.

23:08.087 --> 23:11.956
Hey, look at that, it's got
a dressurized pelivery system.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.557
( Taser crackling )

23:15.761 --> 23:17.628
Bring them to the boss.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.134
( Dragons screeching )

23:25.937 --> 23:27.972
( Groans )

23:29.007 --> 23:31.809
Oh, Jesus.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.911
Baird. Baird.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.413
Who are you?

23:35.415 --> 23:37.615
You are not Eve baird.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.517
I saw her die.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.485
Yeah, well, I just saw you die.

23:41.487 --> 23:42.887
So we're even.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.688
I don't know what sort
of trick this is,

23:44.690 --> 23:45.823
but when my liege comes...

23:45.825 --> 23:47.958
Dulaque?

23:47.960 --> 23:49.660
( Grunts )

23:52.697 --> 23:58.068
Pro-tip, always handcuff people to
the chair not just in the chair.

23:59.137 --> 24:01.906
Enough of this.
I said enough.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.877
My librarian, apologies.

24:13.018 --> 24:15.219
Aren't you interesting?

24:18.490 --> 24:20.458
And not from around here.

24:20.460 --> 24:23.127
Or rather, around now.

24:25.797 --> 24:31.635
Or rather, maybe now
there but not now here.

24:34.539 --> 24:37.074
And Eve, but not my Eve.

24:37.076 --> 24:41.779
Please don't say
I'm like your mother.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.714
No.

24:43.716 --> 24:46.150
Nothing like that.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.018
Walk with me.

25:06.137 --> 25:08.205
I wish they wouldn't do that.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.974
You saved them from the dragons.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.243
They owe you that fealty.

25:12.245 --> 25:13.644
Okay, what is this?

25:13.646 --> 25:15.179
I am her guardian.

25:15.181 --> 25:18.215
I took over after you died.

25:18.217 --> 25:21.685
So I die in every timeline.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.821
Timeline.

25:23.823 --> 25:26.023
Of course.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.993
You're skipping through alternate
timelines, aren't you?

25:28.995 --> 25:32.296
Morgan le fay warned
me something was coming,

25:32.298 --> 25:34.098
something to do with...

25:36.835 --> 25:38.602
The loom of fate.

25:38.604 --> 25:41.138
I saw dulaque cut the threads.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.840
Dulaque's dead.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.775
I killed him
after he killed you.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.077
Taking the library
was one thing.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.178
But Cassandra...

25:48.180 --> 25:50.648
When Excalibur healed her,

25:50.650 --> 25:53.584
I knew that she was
the chosen one.

25:59.057 --> 26:02.693
In my timeline, when dulaque
cut the fabric of the loom,

26:02.695 --> 26:04.695
he wanted to go back
to when Camelot was around.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.263
How would that even work?

26:06.265 --> 26:09.967
Well, the loom of fate
just spits out history

26:09.969 --> 26:12.102
so if you cut it--

26:12.104 --> 26:14.805
well, you know, if you
cut the loom,

26:14.807 --> 26:16.941
then you end history at
a certain point

26:16.943 --> 26:19.643
and then history would start again
from wherever you cut them.

26:19.645 --> 26:21.078
What I don't
understand is why Camelot?

26:21.080 --> 26:23.280
Oh, wait, I do understand.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.816
His name is dulaque,
king Arthur.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.252
Dulaque wanted history
to start fresh at Camelot

26:28.254 --> 26:31.255
at the height of his power
and the power of magic.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.757
He's a fool.

26:33.759 --> 26:36.694
He cut the thread of fate,
but didn't reweave it.

26:36.696 --> 26:41.298
Now the fabric
of history is frayed,

26:41.300 --> 26:43.667
so it's unwinding.

26:43.669 --> 26:45.903
You're skipping
from thread to thread,

26:45.905 --> 26:49.640
each one another possible path
history could have taken.

26:53.144 --> 26:54.912
What's with all the magic?

26:54.914 --> 26:57.848
We learned how to use it
in order to hunt it.

26:57.850 --> 27:01.785
When my brain tumor grew,
I used magic to save my life,

27:01.787 --> 27:06.824
but it altered
my brain permanently.

27:06.826 --> 27:09.259
You never did approve.

27:12.664 --> 27:15.032
This is horrible.

27:15.034 --> 27:17.201
History will continue
to unravel until

27:17.203 --> 27:19.336
all of time is undone.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.972
How do we fix this?

27:23.375 --> 27:25.342
We don't.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.378
Gather the others.

27:27.380 --> 27:28.746
Yes.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.414
We lost, Eve.

27:30.416 --> 27:34.985
We had 10 good years
and in the end, we just lost.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.755
I'm going to evacuate
this world.

27:37.757 --> 27:40.324
Morgan le fay taught me
how to open doors.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.326
I'll take as many
through as I can.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.396
But you can't--
you can't just give up.

27:45.398 --> 27:47.665
You're a librarian, right?

27:47.667 --> 27:48.666
I mean, like stone
was a librarian,

27:48.668 --> 27:49.967
Ezekiel was a librarian?

27:49.969 --> 27:52.202
I don't know who
you're talking about.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.171
I mean, I'm just saying
I didn't see the other ones

27:54.173 --> 27:56.273
give up and you seem
to be holding out longer

27:56.275 --> 27:59.376
than they did, so why
would you give up?

27:59.378 --> 28:01.412
He's your librarian.

28:01.414 --> 28:03.113
No. No, I'm not.

28:03.115 --> 28:04.882
I mean, I could have
been but I quit.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.451
And now I know what
I could have had.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.086
It's not a great life, Flynn.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.154
Well, it's a life.
It's a life of choice.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.388
It's not a life of safety.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.990
If I can go back and--
if I could--

28:12.992 --> 28:14.291
if I could have it now,
I would choose--

28:14.293 --> 28:15.926
I want that now.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.095
I choose to save the world.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.064
Just one more time.

28:20.066 --> 28:23.200
And how do we do that,
not-a-librarian?

28:23.202 --> 28:26.103
Well, the loom that that guy,
dulaque, cut,

28:26.105 --> 28:31.075
you could rethread it
and you could reweave

28:31.077 --> 28:33.911
the threads of history
back into shape.

28:33.913 --> 28:36.146
Magically possible,

28:36.148 --> 28:38.315
but we will need
a very specific thread.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.217
Something ancient.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.753
Something charged
with dimensional power

28:42.755 --> 28:45.489
and tied as closely as possible
to the original Greek myth.

28:45.491 --> 28:48.292
I don't suppose you have
one of those lying around.

28:48.294 --> 28:50.928
Here's something funny.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.872
It looks exactly like
the library's card catalog.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.808
But you've never been
here before to the annex?

29:04.810 --> 29:06.043
No.

29:08.113 --> 29:09.947
No.

29:09.949 --> 29:12.382
No, no, no, no, no.
It was right here.

29:12.384 --> 29:15.352
Jenkins. Jenkins
keeps everything in the back.

29:15.354 --> 29:16.453
Where is he anyway?

29:16.455 --> 29:19.256
Jenkins?
Jenkins!

29:21.059 --> 29:22.960
You care for her.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.394
Ah, no.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.296
Well, I don't really know her.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.431
( Coughs )

29:27.433 --> 29:28.932
Although, I feel like I do.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.935
She will die for you

29:31.937 --> 29:34.138
no matter how much
you don't want her to.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.306
Never forget that.

29:36.308 --> 29:38.442
Jenkins, he's our judson.
He's not here.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.778
But the thread of
the labyrinth was right here.

29:40.780 --> 29:43.547
But this isn't your timeline.
This is her timeline.

29:43.549 --> 29:46.517
Whatever you did to get that ball
of twine here never happened.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.288
So how do I get
back to my timeline?

29:51.290 --> 29:52.890
You can't.

29:52.892 --> 29:56.193
History is fraying.
It's pulling apart.

29:56.195 --> 29:59.096
The threads are getting
further and further apart.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.532
You can't go back.

30:01.534 --> 30:04.067
We failed.

30:04.069 --> 30:05.435
No. No, no, no.

30:05.437 --> 30:07.571
There is always another chance.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.239
There's always another trick.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.574
There's always
something left to learn.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.476
History's unraveling.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.179
Unraveling like a-- like
a-- like a-- like a rope,

30:15.181 --> 30:17.214
like a sailor's rope,
like a sailor's rope.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.216
And what does a sailor do
with his rope?

30:19.218 --> 30:21.051
He throws the rope
and he hauls the rope,

30:21.053 --> 30:22.586
and he cuts the rope,
and he ties the rope

30:22.588 --> 30:24.588
and he splices-- ah!

30:24.590 --> 30:28.091
Splices a rope.
Why don't we do that?

30:28.093 --> 30:30.360
We could splice
the threads of history together

30:30.362 --> 30:32.029
just for a minute.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.997
Take one thread,
weave it against

30:33.999 --> 30:37.034
the next which brings
in the thread next to that

30:37.036 --> 30:39.203
and then the next one.

30:39.205 --> 30:43.307
- It can work.
- ( Snaps )

30:43.309 --> 30:45.475
But I will need a focus.

30:45.477 --> 30:48.979
Something common across all of the
timelines that you've traveled.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.183
- The librarians.
- The librarians.

30:54.919 --> 30:57.554
I'm punching a hole
in three universes.

30:57.556 --> 31:01.124
Hold on.

31:01.126 --> 31:03.060
( Speaking Latin )

31:18.910 --> 31:20.210
( Rumbling )

31:22.013 --> 31:23.647
Do you hear that?

31:23.649 --> 31:27.351
Quiet.
I'm doing math.

31:44.469 --> 31:46.370
Well, hello then.

31:46.372 --> 31:47.971
Almost.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.447
What just happened?

31:57.449 --> 32:01.018
Concentrate, librarians,
your lives, your histories,

32:01.020 --> 32:02.386
and your friends.

32:02.388 --> 32:03.987
Wait, you're librarians?

32:03.989 --> 32:07.157
We are librarians, of course.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.959
( Electricity crackles )

32:15.500 --> 32:17.601
Whose world is this?

32:17.603 --> 32:19.636
Hers.

32:19.638 --> 32:22.239
Hey!

32:22.241 --> 32:25.208
The doors to the loom are open.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.010
It is beyond space and time.

32:27.012 --> 32:29.646
Concentrate on the moment
you left

32:29.648 --> 32:32.549
and you'll return
to that exact point.

32:32.551 --> 32:35.052
Thank you.

32:35.054 --> 32:37.020
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
if we go back to our timeline,

32:37.022 --> 32:38.488
they'll cease to exist.

32:38.490 --> 32:41.158
You understand, if we go back,

32:41.160 --> 32:45.295
you'll-- you've--
you'll just be gone.

32:45.297 --> 32:48.265
It's been an interesting life.

32:48.267 --> 32:52.436
A life of mystery and misery.

32:52.438 --> 32:57.174
With loneliness, but adventure.

32:57.176 --> 32:58.709
A chance to make a difference.

32:58.711 --> 33:00.744
A chance to save the world
every week,

33:00.746 --> 33:02.579
twice before Friday.

33:02.581 --> 33:06.616
Go kick some ass, librarian.

33:14.525 --> 33:16.259
Okay.

33:16.261 --> 33:18.195
I'll assume you have
a degree in ancient weaving?

33:18.197 --> 33:20.230
Well, it's folded into
a doctorate on

33:20.232 --> 33:21.365
medieval agricultural...

33:21.367 --> 33:22.532
- Shut up and weave.
- Okay.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.536
Who are you looking for?

33:26.538 --> 33:28.739
Dulaque may still be here.

33:28.741 --> 33:30.440
Should I be worried?

33:30.442 --> 33:34.111
Well, no, I mean, he's a
pretty frail old guy and...

33:37.215 --> 33:39.349
Augh...

33:39.351 --> 33:40.450
Ow.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.388
You call that frail?

33:44.390 --> 33:48.425
Rewind history to Camelot
and this was me, at Camelot.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.160
Lovely side effect, really.

33:50.162 --> 33:51.495
What is with you and Camelot?

33:51.497 --> 33:53.096
It was perfect.

33:53.098 --> 33:55.332
A just king, knights of honor,

33:55.334 --> 33:58.235
magic to control the world,
it was a perfect world.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.303
Until you ruined it.

34:00.305 --> 34:02.672
Lancelot.
Lancelot du lac.

34:02.674 --> 34:05.175
Yes. Well,
I'm fixing that now.

34:05.177 --> 34:08.545
Your world is gone.
Welcome to mine.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.213
( Gasps )

34:11.315 --> 34:13.315
No!

34:24.395 --> 34:26.362
All right.
Enough of that.

34:35.406 --> 34:38.108
She was fated to die
saving her librarian.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.376
It's just a matter of time

34:39.378 --> 34:41.545
before that day
caught up with her.

34:45.116 --> 34:48.118
There are other versions of you
that might have had a chance.

34:48.120 --> 34:51.353
But there's only one swordsman
my equal,

34:51.356 --> 34:53.456
and you are not him.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.360
Lancelot.

34:57.362 --> 34:58.795
Galahad.

35:00.731 --> 35:02.499
Why are you doing this?

35:02.501 --> 35:04.101
I'm bringing back
the shining city.

35:04.103 --> 35:06.503
Camelot fell, that was its fate.

35:06.505 --> 35:09.539
Mr. carsen, would you
please restring the loom?

35:15.780 --> 35:17.114
No!

35:21.219 --> 35:22.652
But we had magic then.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.287
The world was a better place.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.423
Really? Wild magic,
cruel kings, mad wizards.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.858
Yes, it was a pip.

35:27.860 --> 35:30.460
The people need to be
ruled by wisdom.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.230
And the stupid little humans
need to be ruled by kings.

35:39.537 --> 35:41.171
No, no.

35:41.173 --> 35:43.840
They have earned
the right to rule themselves.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.643
The time of kings has passed.

35:51.716 --> 35:52.883
Librarian!

35:56.454 --> 36:00.390
Jenkins, the fates
have come back inline.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.159
Why isn't she better?

36:02.161 --> 36:03.360
This is her fate.

36:03.362 --> 36:04.728
I'm sorry.

36:07.331 --> 36:09.566
I do die in every timeline.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.468
No.

36:11.470 --> 36:12.869
No, no, no, there's
always another trick.

36:12.871 --> 36:14.371
There's always another chance.

36:16.607 --> 36:17.774
I have an idea.

36:17.776 --> 36:18.875
Will you help me with her?

36:18.877 --> 36:19.943
Yes.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.679
All right.
Get ready to jump.

36:22.681 --> 36:23.680
Jump? Where?

36:23.682 --> 36:24.948
Everywhere.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.188
- Where have you been?
- Where's dulaque?

36:31.190 --> 36:32.222
What happened to colonel baird?

36:32.224 --> 36:33.223
Never mind that.
Come take her!

36:33.225 --> 36:34.291
Take her.

36:34.293 --> 36:35.358
I have to finish the story book.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.526
Take her.
Take her!

36:36.528 --> 36:38.962
I have to finish the story book.

36:38.964 --> 36:44.534
With this blood the passage
opens to the library.

36:45.903 --> 36:47.204
Yes. Go.

36:47.206 --> 36:48.705
Go, go, go.

36:48.707 --> 36:49.806
- Let's go. Let's go!
- Careful. Careful.

36:49.808 --> 36:50.941
Go.

36:55.780 --> 36:57.480
The library is back.

36:59.917 --> 37:01.685
Flynn!

37:01.687 --> 37:03.720
She's dying and all
you care about is the library?

37:03.722 --> 37:05.956
She brought the library back,
she gave her blood.

37:05.958 --> 37:07.691
don't you get it?

37:07.693 --> 37:10.327
The library and everything
that's in it is back.

37:14.966 --> 37:18.668
She's fading.
I can barely feel her pulse.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.404
Flynn, whatever it is, now.

37:22.940 --> 37:25.308
Where did I put it?
Where did I put it?

37:30.381 --> 37:32.315
No ordinary wound.

37:36.887 --> 37:38.355
I got nothing.

37:42.560 --> 37:43.793
No.

37:43.795 --> 37:46.997
No, no, no, no.

37:46.999 --> 37:49.532
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes.

37:49.534 --> 37:53.603
What is that-- you drink
that when you got stabbed.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.980
( Gasps )

38:09.687 --> 38:12.389
I was supposed to die.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.391
I don't believe in fate.

38:22.867 --> 38:25.535
And the library is back.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.937
How does it feel?

38:27.939 --> 38:30.874
Like home.

38:36.514 --> 38:38.448
Colonel baird,
the graduation gifts

38:38.450 --> 38:39.983
I believe are on your desk.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.518
So what, you're kicking us out?

38:41.520 --> 38:44.087
No, I'm pushing you
out of the nest.

38:44.089 --> 38:46.690
It's time to fly.
I'm graduating you.

38:55.099 --> 38:58.335
We had Jenkins make up small
versions of the clipping book.

38:58.337 --> 39:01.838
Every day a new mystery.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.972
Different ones?

39:02.974 --> 39:05.342
Yes. And isn't that wonderful?

39:05.344 --> 39:08.378
Team up on some,
split up on others,

39:08.380 --> 39:10.080
come back and get us
if you need any help.

39:10.082 --> 39:14.117
But don't need too much help,
that would be disappointing.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.120
Are you sure we're ready
for this?

39:17.122 --> 39:19.556
I think that if we've learned
anything it's that

39:19.558 --> 39:24.527
whatever fate has in store for
us, we should meet it head on.

39:25.730 --> 39:27.464
Trust me, you'll be fine.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.532
I've seen it.

39:29.534 --> 39:33.036
Ah, Mr. carsen, I found
this letter in the library

39:33.038 --> 39:34.437
from charlene to you sir.

39:34.439 --> 39:37.107
Ah, thank you Jenkins.

39:37.109 --> 39:39.409
Okay.

39:39.411 --> 39:42.645
Good-bye. Librarians.

39:42.647 --> 39:44.114
Come back alive.

39:48.619 --> 39:51.921
No offense, but I could
use a bit of a break.

39:51.923 --> 39:55.625
I mean, despite my many
awesome heroics,

39:55.627 --> 39:58.995
it's still a bit
judge-y in here.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.930
Well, I've been spinning
a tale to my family

40:00.932 --> 40:03.600
that I was down on
the oil refinery in Texas.

40:03.602 --> 40:07.670
I guess I could swing by
and say hi to the folks.

40:07.672 --> 40:10.140
My family and I aren't really...

40:10.142 --> 40:12.542
You know, um...

40:15.179 --> 40:17.147
I think I'll try a case.

40:24.822 --> 40:29.492
Ooh.

40:29.494 --> 40:31.528
It's a tricky one.

40:33.197 --> 40:35.665
Deep breaths.

40:37.034 --> 40:38.935
Where are you--
where are you going?

40:38.937 --> 40:41.738
Lima, Peru.

40:41.740 --> 40:44.040
Good luck.

40:52.116 --> 40:55.185
Actually, I know
a great little cafe in Lima.

40:55.187 --> 40:56.920
Amazing arroz tapado.

40:56.922 --> 40:59.222
You know, I've been meaning
to check out machu picchu.

40:59.224 --> 41:00.857
I didn't know you
liked wrestling.

41:00.859 --> 41:03.059
Oh, buddy... you don't know
what machu picchu is?

41:03.061 --> 41:05.128
How do you call yourself
a librarian?

41:05.130 --> 41:07.564
I'm just as much one
as you, I got a book.

41:07.566 --> 41:08.865
That's a pity book.

41:12.736 --> 41:16.706
Jenkins, thank you.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.041
I'm sorry?

41:18.043 --> 41:19.576
For what you did.

41:19.578 --> 41:22.612
How you saved us at the loom.

41:22.614 --> 41:26.716
Ah, well...
( Stammers )

41:26.718 --> 41:28.685
While I was undoubtedly heroic,

41:28.687 --> 41:30.153
I'm afraid that like the others,

41:30.155 --> 41:33.490
I don't remember
what happened while history

41:33.492 --> 41:35.091
and fate were, you know...

41:35.093 --> 41:36.092
Waa-waa-waa.

41:36.094 --> 41:37.894
Unspun.

41:37.896 --> 41:40.563
Yeah. Flynn says he can't
remember anything either.

41:40.565 --> 41:43.900
Vexing.
Still vexing.

41:43.902 --> 41:47.770
So how did I remember?

41:47.772 --> 41:51.941
How did my mind stay intact
across all those threads?

41:51.943 --> 41:57.146
Well, if I may venture a guess, it
was because you did it once before.

41:57.148 --> 41:59.082
The Christmas affair.

41:59.084 --> 42:00.216
You fractured in Santa's place

42:00.218 --> 42:02.018
and spread across
space and time.

42:02.020 --> 42:05.588
So you were prepared to hold up
under similar circumstances.

42:05.590 --> 42:07.724
That's a hell of a coincidence.

42:07.726 --> 42:10.059
Ah, and with the story book,
Tesla device,

42:10.061 --> 42:14.130
the thread, all required
to bring the library home.

42:14.132 --> 42:15.965
Almost...

42:15.967 --> 42:18.067
Well, almost as if
these past months

42:18.069 --> 42:20.570
your missions had been
directed by fate itself.

42:20.572 --> 42:24.274
But the clipping book
didn't send us to Santa.

42:24.276 --> 42:25.909
You did.

42:29.179 --> 42:31.915
Coincidence.

42:31.917 --> 42:33.249
( Flynn whistling )

42:35.019 --> 42:36.786
So you don't remember
anything either?

42:36.788 --> 42:39.589
Oh, bits and pieces.

42:39.591 --> 42:41.224
I saved the world
at least once, right?

42:41.226 --> 42:42.225
Yeah.

42:42.227 --> 42:44.193
Well, business as usual.

42:44.195 --> 42:45.995
I got to see what you were like
if you weren't the librarian.

42:45.997 --> 42:48.164
How was I?

42:48.166 --> 42:50.833
Scattered.
Annoying.

42:50.835 --> 42:53.069
Alternating between
genius and bad puns.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.605
So business as usual.

42:55.607 --> 42:57.173
Hello.

43:01.145 --> 43:02.612
Is this always like this?

43:02.614 --> 43:04.047
Only in really bad
circumstances.

43:04.049 --> 43:06.182
Ah, well, I'm guessing monsters.

43:06.184 --> 43:08.318
Nah, mad scientist.

43:08.320 --> 43:10.587
Maybe evil cult.

43:10.589 --> 43:15.625
So I was also thinking that, um,
I'll throw this out there

43:15.627 --> 43:17.694
and I don't want to put any pressure
on you one way or the other

43:17.696 --> 43:22.231
nor do I want to assume you have
or have not other appointments...

43:22.233 --> 43:23.299
You're asking me on a date.

43:23.301 --> 43:26.603
Yeah. Yes, I am.

43:26.605 --> 43:28.805
Good. I had nine
more minutes of that.

43:30.941 --> 43:32.842
Where were you
thinking of taking me?

43:35.145 --> 43:36.346
Going to fight...

43:36.348 --> 43:37.947
- Investigate.
- An evil cult...

43:37.949 --> 43:41.618
- Monsters.
- Is your idea of a date.

43:43.755 --> 43:45.321
Do you have any idea what's on
the other side of this door?

43:45.323 --> 43:46.723
No.

43:49.927 --> 43:51.861
But isn't that great?

44:02.306 --> 44:05.108
( Music playing )
