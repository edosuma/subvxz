Torchwood.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.980
Outside the
Government,beyond the Police.

00:06.990 --> 00:10.170
Fighting for the future on
behalf of the human race.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.210
The 21st century is when
everything changes...

00:14.590 --> 00:17.330
and Torchwood is ready.

From Mum:UR 9 mins late!MUMxx

01:10.380 --> 01:12.270
Chill!:- P

01:13.670 --> 01:15.780
Cheeky bugger!

01:59.450 --> 02:03.180
Jonah Bevan,born 15th February 1993,

02:03.190 --> 02:08.389
son of Nikki Bevan and Paul
Millet,14 Cliffs Rise,Penarth.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.510
Disappeared walking home
from football practice,

02:11.520 --> 02:14.550
been missing now for seven
months and eleven days.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.570
No body,no sightings since that night.

02:17.580 --> 02:20.530
Disappeared right where we're standing.

02:22.540 --> 02:24.330
Which is where we found this.

02:24.340 --> 02:27.670
He sent a text to his mum,she was
looking out the window and they waved.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.770
She says everywhere was deserted.

02:29.780 --> 02:30.930
And the investigation?

02:30.940 --> 02:34.660
Usual procedure
- searched the home,spoken to all friends and relatives,

02:34.670 --> 02:37.420
made publicity appeals,but
no significant leads...

02:37.430 --> 02:38.730
Is this beneath you now?

02:38.740 --> 02:39.680
No!

02:39.690 --> 02:42.260
Then what's with the attitude?
You've a face like a slapped arse.

02:42.270 --> 02:44.380
I want you to tell me where you were.

02:44.390 --> 02:45.420
Where I was when?

02:45.430 --> 02:46.940
At the wedding.

02:46.950 --> 02:48.370
I rang you. I had to work.

02:48.380 --> 02:50.240
Temple changed the
rota at the last minute.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.830
I checked the duty logs.
You had three days off.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.290
Are you spying on me now?

02:54.300 --> 02:57.060
I thought we were mates.
And you just don't turn up!

02:57.070 --> 02:59.840
I just thought,being as Rhys
has got a problem with me...

02:59.850 --> 03:02.580
Rhys thinks you're great! It's
you who has a problem with him!

03:02.590 --> 03:05.240
You've always made sarky
comments about his weight!

03:05.250 --> 03:06.620
He could stand to lose
a couple of pounds...

03:06.630 --> 03:08.860
Let it go! Let it go.

03:08.870 --> 03:10.840
Yeah,well,I can't! All right?

03:10.850 --> 03:14.690
I don't want to sit there and watch
you pledge your stupid life to him!

03:14.700 --> 03:16.750
I've got better things
to do of a Saturday!

03:16.760 --> 03:18.450
Happy now?

03:20.790 --> 03:22.810
- Oh,Andy!
- Get off!

03:23.110 --> 03:25.880
I thought we'd been through
this. You're a lovely fella...

03:25.890 --> 03:27.490
It's not like a bloody tap.
I can't just switch it off.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.150
But this was three years ago.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.470
I mean,I didn't know...

03:31.480 --> 03:33.280
I didn't realise you
still had feelings...

03:33.290 --> 03:36.970
I don't,all right? I just had a moment.

03:36.980 --> 03:38.820
Don't flatter yourself.

03:38.830 --> 03:40.320
OK!

03:41.370 --> 03:42.540
If you want to talk about it...

03:42.550 --> 03:45.000
I wanna talk about this kid. Jonah.

03:45.010 --> 03:46.260
Teenagers go missing all the time.

03:46.270 --> 03:48.500
I mean,why is this one so special?

03:48.520 --> 03:50.150
I was the first one here.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.870
Sat with his mum all
night and all the next day.

03:52.890 --> 03:56.960
Every time I tell her we've got
nothing new,I see a bit of her die.

03:57.630 --> 04:00.090
Anything strange about the case?

04:00.640 --> 04:02.830
Like you don't know.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.790
What just happened?

04:17.800 --> 04:19.220
Exactly.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.030
The camera records one
frame every six seconds.

04:24.040 --> 04:27.460
He could've done a lot in six
seconds,jumped over the side...

04:27.470 --> 04:31.340
No,he's looking at something glowing,just
out of the camera's line of sight.

04:31.350 --> 04:34.970
Like a flare,it's not there
in the previous frame...

04:35.280 --> 04:37.140
or the next.

04:40.450 --> 04:42.540
Could be one of the
lights on the Barrage.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.540
All right,stop lying. You
know what happened here.

04:44.550 --> 04:45.790
Why aren't you telling me?

04:45.800 --> 04:47.620
What are you talking about,Andy?

04:47.630 --> 04:51.220
Right... 45 minutes later...

04:53.100 --> 04:55.670
What's your mate Mulder doing there?

04:56.820 --> 04:58.530
Jack?

05:00.180 --> 05:04.720
No recognisable rift activity
around the Barrage on that date.

05:05.050 --> 05:05.970
What about if you tried...?

05:05.980 --> 05:08.180
I ran checks for three
months either side.

05:08.190 --> 05:10.290
Then extended the radius
by a mile and checked again.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.670
Still nothing.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.400
OK.Thanks.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.150
When did you say this was?

05:17.160 --> 05:19.030
About seven months back.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.870
Were you on the Barrage that night?

05:20.880 --> 05:22.770
They have this cute little coffee shack.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.290
I sometimes stop by there.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.240
A boy went missing.

05:27.250 --> 05:30.280
Just under an hour
before you were there.

05:30.290 --> 05:30.940
OK.

05:30.950 --> 05:32.710
Jonah Bevan,15 years old.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.850
I thought maybe you were
out there because of him.

05:35.140 --> 05:37.140
Maybe if we'd registered rift activity.

05:37.150 --> 05:39.090
No. I just checked with Tosh.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.210
It was all clear.

05:40.220 --> 05:41.650
Sorry. Can't help.

05:44.230 --> 05:45.610
Do you want me to look into it for you?

05:45.620 --> 05:46.610
No,it's fine.

05:46.620 --> 05:48.250
So it was just a coincidence then?

05:48.260 --> 05:49.910
Guess so. Gotta go.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.230
Weevil hunting with lanto.

06:05.630 --> 06:07.660
So,you're covering it up then?

06:07.670 --> 06:08.860
Jack said it was a coincidence.

06:08.870 --> 06:10.960
- I can't help.
- Thanks a lot.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.820
Should've known. Bloody Torchwood.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.680
Fob me off,why don't you?

06:14.690 --> 06:17.070
No. If there was something
going on,I would tell you.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.570
Do you know what's happened to you,Gwen?

06:19.580 --> 06:20.960
You've got hard.

06:21.970 --> 06:24.570
Yeah? Well,maybe I've had to.

06:24.580 --> 06:27.740
You used to care. You used
to be bothered about people.

06:27.750 --> 06:29.840
Didn't matter who they
were,or what they did.

06:29.850 --> 06:33.620
And now you're talking about coincidence,like
people go missing all the time.

06:33.630 --> 06:35.280
Like it's a fact of life.

06:35.290 --> 06:38.860
The old Gwen would have been up
there to see Nikki Bevan in a flash.

06:38.870 --> 06:40.410
You're one of them now,aren't you?

06:40.420 --> 06:42.920
Too busy to bother
with one missing child.

06:42.930 --> 06:44.710
What is it,not major enough for you?

06:45.350 --> 06:47.980
Not spooky enough?

06:48.310 --> 06:50.420
Sorry to bother you.

07:00.790 --> 07:03.080
Nikki Bevan? Gwen Cooper.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.080
I'm working with the police
on Jonah's disappearance.

07:06.930 --> 07:09.350
Andy said you might be round.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.940
Oh,he did,did he?

07:12.220 --> 07:14.540
Reckons you've got a
different area of expertise.

07:14.550 --> 07:16.850
What is it,forensics?

07:18.080 --> 07:19.410
I'm just a fresh eye.

07:19.420 --> 07:21.590
Sorry about the mess.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.680
Wow,film fan,are you?

07:25.690 --> 07:26.630
Crowds.

07:26.640 --> 07:27.650
Sorry?

07:27.660 --> 07:29.030
It's all crowd footage.

07:29.040 --> 07:33.670
Ever since he went. Football
matches,concerts,festivals...

07:33.980 --> 07:36.050
Anywhere there's a crowd,I record it.

07:36.060 --> 07:39.180
Go through it,frame by
frame,checking every face.

07:40.810 --> 07:44.300
Sometimes I think it's him,but
the picture's so grainy,

07:44.310 --> 07:46.730
I spend hours looking at
one corner of the screen.

07:46.740 --> 07:49.920
But then the next day,I
check again and it's not.

07:50.860 --> 07:53.450
It's the hope that's killing me.

07:53.460 --> 07:55.080
Even if you saw him,what would you do?

07:55.090 --> 07:56.610
Find someone that was with him.

07:56.620 --> 08:01.290
If I could just let him know I saw
him. He's gotta be out there somewhere.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.230
Do you think I'm mad?

08:05.240 --> 08:07.990
No,I think you'd make
a great policewoman.

08:08.670 --> 08:11.270
His room's as he left it?

08:11.670 --> 08:14.310
I sleep in here some nights.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.000
Bury my head in the pillow.

08:16.010 --> 08:17.460
It still smells of him.

08:17.470 --> 08:20.670
Except,the more I do it,the
more it smells like me.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.810
I keep his diary for him.

08:25.820 --> 08:30.280
I sit in here and imagine I'm him.

08:35.700 --> 08:38.159
What do you think I did wrong?

08:38.169 --> 08:39.789
Sorry?

08:41.679 --> 08:43.730
Maybe I was too nosey...

08:43.740 --> 08:45.930
or not interested enough.

08:45.940 --> 08:48.760
Maybe he felt unloved.

08:51.420 --> 08:54.520
All I've got is questions.

08:54.530 --> 08:56.440
What about Jonah's dad?

08:56.450 --> 08:58.320
We were only together about six weeks.

08:58.340 --> 09:02.270
I thought when he first went missing and
was on the telly,his dad might get in touch.

09:02.290 --> 09:05.590
But no,still manages to disappoint.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.620
Oh,hang on!

09:08.650 --> 09:11.370
Andy tried to find me a support
group,but there weren't any.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.320
So I thought I'd set one up myself.

09:13.330 --> 09:14.790
It's our first meeting. Will you come?

09:14.800 --> 09:15.850
Oh,I dunno.

09:15.860 --> 09:16.855
Andy'll be there.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.670
{\a6}HAS SOMEONE YOU KNOW GONE
MISSING?COME ALONG TO SEARCHLIGHT

09:19.420 --> 09:20.480
And I'm gonna do food. Oh,come on.

09:20.515 --> 09:21.540
I don't wanna be sat there on my own.

09:21.870 --> 09:24.690
I'll try,I've got to go.

09:33.450 --> 09:35.210
I'm sorry,I know,I'm late.

09:35.220 --> 09:36.000
Three hours!

09:36.010 --> 09:38.810
It was a work thing,time just
got away from me. Ooh,wine!

09:38.820 --> 09:40.830
We can do it another time though,yeah?

09:40.840 --> 09:43.550
This is the fourth another time,Gwen!

09:43.560 --> 09:46.050
- You said you'd cook.
- Did I?

09:46.550 --> 09:47.870
When are we gonna have this talk?

09:47.880 --> 09:51.540
Let's do it now. Come on,now's
good,I'm ready. Babies. Now.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.230
- Really?
- Have I changed?

09:53.240 --> 09:55.160
Since I joined
Torchwood. Am I different?

09:55.170 --> 09:57.910
- Why?
- It's just something Andy said.

09:58.450 --> 10:01.530
- OK,let me just tell you this one thing,OK?
- Go on.

10:01.540 --> 10:03.510
He still fancies me.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.540
Don't laugh,Rhys. That's why
he didn't come to the wedding.

10:07.550 --> 10:09.420
Bloody hell. Poor sod.

10:10.350 --> 10:12.860
I am a very sexy lady...

10:12.870 --> 10:14.950
and you are a very lucky man!

10:14.960 --> 10:17.400
Just remember that,OK?

10:20.220 --> 10:22.280
We're not gonna talk
about kids tonight,are we?

10:22.290 --> 10:24.550
We could do some practising.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.060
Tell me you love me!

10:29.070 --> 10:29.890
Gimme the toast.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.610
Come on,tell me you love me first!

10:31.620 --> 10:34.280
- Gimme the toast first!
- Tell me you love me!

10:39.230 --> 10:40.520
- Gwen.
- Hi,Tosh.

10:40.530 --> 10:43.630
I've dug up some new data
on that night at the Barrage.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.750
I think you might
wanna take a look at it.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.410
I'll be right there.

10:48.300 --> 10:49.820
- Deserting me,are you?
- Yep.

10:52.030 --> 10:53.740
Ugh,crumbs.

10:57.330 --> 11:00.020
Hey,what have you got?

11:00.030 --> 11:01.720
It's barely a blip on the system.

11:01.730 --> 11:03.890
So insignificant,I've been ignoring it.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.860
But when I looked closer...

11:07.330 --> 11:10.930
This is what we recognise
as standard rift activity.

11:11.670 --> 11:16.590
But what I've discovered is a negative rift
spike that occurred at the time you're querying.

11:16.600 --> 11:21.100
Now,we've always assumed that these
readings were residual rift flares.

11:21.110 --> 11:22.640
Like an aftershock.

11:22.650 --> 11:27.690
But,because this one coincided with Jonah's
disappearance,I think we've been misinterpreting.

11:27.700 --> 11:28.900
OK,so?

11:28.910 --> 11:34.800
So,we've always believed that things
can only come through the rift one way.

11:34.810 --> 11:36.050
What if we're wrong?

11:36.060 --> 11:39.530
What if the rift doesn't
just leave stuff behind?

11:40.260 --> 11:42.820
What if it also takes?

11:48.480 --> 11:49.970
Who else have you told about this?

11:49.980 --> 11:52.770
No-one. I called you
as soon as I realised.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.690
It could be a coincidence,or an anomaly.

11:54.700 --> 11:57.750
I can't be sure unless I can
cross-reference it with other examples.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.350
Can we keep this to ourselves?

11:59.360 --> 12:00.640
There's something I have to do.

12:00.650 --> 12:01.920
Whatever you think is best.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.650
Thank you,you're a sweetheart.

12:12.260 --> 12:15.770
{\a6}HAS SOMEONE YOU KNOW GONE MISSING?COME ALONG TO SEARCHLIGHT.A NEW
SUPPORT GROUP FOR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES OF MISSING PERSONS.ALL ARE WELCOME

12:15.805 --> 12:16.440
You're looking into it,then.

12:16.450 --> 12:18.480
Still the same old me.

12:18.950 --> 12:20.310
Thank you.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.040
Yeah,well,I dunno why
I bother,you're so rude.

12:23.050 --> 12:25.980
How's Rhys? Other than hungry.

12:35.460 --> 12:37.580
- It's you two.
- Oh,that's nice.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.850
I thought there'd be more here by now.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.980
It's gonna just be me,isn't it?

12:41.990 --> 12:44.140
No,I'm sure it won't. People will come.

12:44.150 --> 12:47.450
Yeah,you know,"If you
build it,they will come".

12:48.150 --> 12:50.550
Field Of Dreams? No?

12:50.560 --> 12:52.750
Just me,then.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.670
Anyway,sit down.

13:05.940 --> 13:08.550
It is gonna be just us,isn't it?

13:14.430 --> 13:15.660
We're looking for Nikki.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.330
Yeah,that's me. Come in.

13:17.340 --> 13:19.000
It's brilliant you found us.

13:19.010 --> 13:22.690
There's food there,drinks,so
help yourself.

13:23.230 --> 13:24.380
Is this missing persons?

13:24.390 --> 13:28.240
Yeah. Come in. Erm,do you wanna drink?

14:10.480 --> 14:11.720
Bloody hell!

14:11.730 --> 14:13.880
How many of them are there?

14:16.270 --> 14:17.850
You OK?

14:18.260 --> 14:20.490
It's getting a bit too much now.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.550
I dunno what you mean.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.340
I said I'd help you look for one lad.

14:24.350 --> 14:26.680
What about all those
people in there,what...

14:26.690 --> 14:28.260
40,50?

14:28.300 --> 14:30.520
Am I supposed to help all them,too?

14:31.090 --> 14:33.370
Course not. Just focus on Jonah.

14:33.380 --> 14:36.040
The rest aren't part
of this investigation.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.770
But they are. Of course they are.

14:39.780 --> 14:41.100
No,no,they're not!

14:41.110 --> 14:43.520
Find a pattern. Find out what
happens,we might find Jonah.

14:43.530 --> 14:46.180
- What?
- Brilliant. You're brilliant!

14:46.190 --> 14:47.810
- I've gotta go.
- Where you going?

14:47.820 --> 14:49.660
Cross-referencing!

14:49.670 --> 14:52.250
Cross-referencing?

14:52.260 --> 14:55.140
You said we need more data to
be sure the rift takes people.

14:55.150 --> 14:58.320
List of all missing persons in
Cardiff over the last ten years.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.380
I'll deal with the personal details,

15:00.390 --> 15:03.670
and I'm sending you dates,locations
and times they went missing.

15:03.680 --> 15:07.520
And you want me to check the dates they
went missing,against negative rift spikes?

15:07.530 --> 15:10.850
Yes,I do,and I'll dig
out any CCTV footage.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.560
What about Jack?

15:12.570 --> 15:15.130
Do we tell him what we're doing?

15:15.140 --> 15:18.640
When we're sure. Tosh,if
we can prove you were right,

15:18.650 --> 15:21.180
we can start looking for
the people who've been taken,

15:21.190 --> 15:23.810
maybe even try and
stop it from happening.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.120
Oh,my God!

16:38.630 --> 16:40.990
There are really this many?

16:41.830 --> 16:43.420
Now we tell Jack.

16:43.430 --> 16:45.620
Cardiff has an epidemic
of missing persons,

16:45.630 --> 16:48.460
totally out of kilter with
any other comparable city.

16:48.470 --> 16:49.950
It's down to the rift.

16:49.960 --> 16:54.230
Are you sure they aren't just missing persons?
People do go missing for other reasons.

16:54.240 --> 16:57.840
No. Toshiko cross-referenced the
locations with the rift spikes.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.600
Those we identified are
definitely victims of the rift.

17:01.610 --> 17:03.170
What do we think happens to them?

17:03.180 --> 17:05.010
Scattered through
time and space,I guess.

17:05.020 --> 17:06.849
Cheery thought,thank you.

17:06.869 --> 17:08.470
This is good work.

17:08.480 --> 17:09.839
But I don't know what you want us to do.

17:09.849 --> 17:12.339
Find a way to prevent it.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.339
Toshiko,can we predict when
the spikes are gonna happen?

17:15.730 --> 17:18.760
No. And they're gone
in a matter of seconds.

17:18.770 --> 17:19.780
Then I don't know how we combat them.

17:19.790 --> 17:21.579
Jack,we have a duty here.

17:21.589 --> 17:23.810
These people are victims of the rift.

17:23.819 --> 17:24.960
If they're attacked by a Weevil...

17:24.970 --> 17:28.590
We can catch them. If they're
victims,we fix their wounds,

17:28.600 --> 17:33.860
but this,we don't know when it's gonna
happen,we don't know where they end up.

17:34.690 --> 17:39.140
Seriously,Gwen. Practically,tell
me what we should do.

17:41.030 --> 17:43.430
We help those left behind.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.180
Why not?

17:45.920 --> 17:47.800
It's nothing to do with us. Move on.

17:47.810 --> 17:49.270
Jack,you should see these people...

17:49.280 --> 17:50.830
Some things we can't fix.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.320
So we don't even try?

17:52.330 --> 17:53.200
Look,Jack's right.

17:53.210 --> 17:56.080
They need counselling.
Support. That is not us.

17:56.090 --> 17:58.590
Ah,OK,is that what you all think?

17:59.340 --> 18:01.420
We are the only ones who know the truth.

18:01.430 --> 18:03.440
We CAN help them. We
don't have to be this hard.

18:03.460 --> 18:04.520
It's not a badge of honour...!

18:04.530 --> 18:07.100
- Close this down.
- Jack!

18:08.690 --> 18:09.610
I'll talk to him.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.350
So,is that it,then?

18:11.360 --> 18:13.210
We sweep it under the carpet?

18:13.220 --> 18:16.100
"Grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change".

18:16.110 --> 18:17.810
Oh,bollocks to serenity.

18:17.820 --> 18:19.810
For a lovely girl,you've
got a very dirty mouth.

18:19.820 --> 18:21.880
- Yes.
- I'm with Jack.

18:25.190 --> 18:27.550
We did our best.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.090
Thanks,Tosh.

18:42.020 --> 18:45.170
On one hand,you've got blokes like Mo,

18:45.180 --> 18:47.850
who swears it's the best
thing he's done in his life.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.610
And then on the
other,you've got Big Dave,

18:50.620 --> 18:52.330
who says it feels
like his life has ended

18:52.340 --> 18:55.080
and now he's a second class
citizen in his own house.

18:55.090 --> 18:58.260
Although to be fair,he said his life had
ended when Susy made him ditch the bike...

18:58.270 --> 19:01.160
Will you just stop wittering!

19:02.540 --> 19:05.170
Thank you. God...!

19:05.520 --> 19:07.980
It's not wittering. It's talking.

19:07.990 --> 19:09.580
We're supposed to be talking.

19:09.590 --> 19:12.060
I've been trying to talk to you
for a week and you don't want to.

19:12.070 --> 19:14.940
Wake up,Rhys! What's the
point? We don't need a talk!

19:14.950 --> 19:16.480
It takes two seconds' thought!

19:16.490 --> 19:20.500
How are we supposed to have kids with
my job? We don't do maternity leave!

19:20.510 --> 19:24.010
"Jack,I'd love to help out with the
aliens,but I can't get a babysitter!

19:24.020 --> 19:26.980
"I'll sort out that bomb once I've
dropped Rhys Junior off at nursery".

19:26.990 --> 19:30.730
Stop dancing around a dead question!

19:32.670 --> 19:35.400
You know,sometimes I fucking hate you!

19:35.410 --> 19:39.400
I mean,look at you,caught up in your
little group,like nothing else matters.

19:39.410 --> 19:42.170
Like being a hero is an
end in itself. It's not.

19:42.180 --> 19:43.520
You save this city. Well done.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.130
- You save the world. What for?
- Sorry?

19:45.140 --> 19:47.820
Why are you doing it?
What are you fighting for?

19:47.830 --> 19:50.460
- Because if I don't...
- Shut up,I'm talking now,right?

19:51.380 --> 19:55.420
You do it so people
can live their lives.

19:55.430 --> 19:57.330
And there's nothing
more important than that.

19:57.350 --> 20:00.940
Falling in love,getting married,buying
flats,having kids,or not.

20:00.970 --> 20:03.980
But real life. That's
what you're protecting.

20:04.640 --> 20:10.420
And if you're starting to think that your
shit is more important than real life...

20:11.250 --> 20:14.370
then we're not gonna
last very long,love.

20:16.660 --> 20:18.840
I'm sorry.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.830
- There's this thing at work...
- I don't care!

20:21.840 --> 20:24.540
When you're with me,we deal
with us,right? Our lives.

20:24.550 --> 20:28.160
You got a problem at
work,sort it at work.

20:42.750 --> 20:44.650
Jack?

20:53.890 --> 20:55.500
Jack,I...

20:55.510 --> 20:57.130
Oh,God!

20:57.670 --> 20:59.440
I'm sorry.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.550
lanto,I'm sorry,I didn't realise.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.200
It doesn't matter.

21:10.210 --> 21:11.350
And I wouldn't have
come in if I'd known...

21:11.360 --> 21:13.350
Always room for one more.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.340
We could've used you an hour
ago for naked hide-and-seek.

21:17.350 --> 21:19.350
He cheats. He always cheats.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.620
Was there something you wanted?

21:20.630 --> 21:23.480
Jonah Bevan. The missing boy.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.870
I'll make it my own special
project,my responsibility,

21:26.880 --> 21:29.820
nothing to do with anyone
else. I'm not letting it go.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.230
No.

21:31.860 --> 21:32.490
What?

21:32.500 --> 21:34.900
I don't know how I can be any clearer.

21:34.910 --> 21:37.470
Oh,well...

21:37.480 --> 21:41.220
Tosh has her projects,so
does lanto. Why can't I?

21:41.230 --> 21:43.950
- Leave it alone.
- I can't.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.650
- Coming back in? Work to do.
- Yup.

21:53.660 --> 21:54.940
Jack! We're not finished!

21:54.950 --> 21:56.980
Yes,we are.

22:00.970 --> 22:03.750
There's a package on your desk.

22:28.410 --> 22:30.420
- Hello?'
- You still working?

22:30.780 --> 22:32.910
- Sort of.
- Thought so.

22:32.920 --> 22:35.470
There's a cup of tea here
'with your name on it. '

22:35.480 --> 22:38.110
You think this will help us
with the Jonah Bevan case?

22:38.120 --> 22:40.790
Just leave it,this is high tech stuff.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.880
- Sorry,no. It's GPS.
- What?

22:43.890 --> 22:47.780
Global Positioning System. About as
high tech as... oh,my mobile phone.

22:47.790 --> 22:50.440
What you've got here is a glorified map.

22:50.450 --> 22:53.060
Ooh,X marks the spot,eh?

22:53.070 --> 22:55.550
X being the middle of
the Bristol Channel.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.320
Oh,no,hang on,sorry,no.

22:57.330 --> 22:59.510
Flat Holm Island. Who's
sending you out there?

22:59.520 --> 23:02.050
That's just deserted scrubland.

23:02.060 --> 23:04.020
Could you get us a refill?

23:04.030 --> 23:06.680
While you bask in my
technical brilliance?

23:13.140 --> 23:15.130
- Hello?
- You left me that package,didn't you?

23:15.140 --> 23:16.360
lanto?

23:16.600 --> 23:17.410
I dunno what you mean.

23:17.420 --> 23:18.580
What's going on?

23:18.590 --> 23:19.720
- IANTO!
- Night,Gwen.

23:19.730 --> 23:21.040
'Don't... '

23:21.960 --> 23:24.920
Right,so first thing in
the morning,we hire a boat.

23:24.940 --> 23:27.120
I know a couple of boat
skippers who owe me a favour.

23:27.130 --> 23:30.830
We'll head to Flat Holm,see
if we can't sort this out.

23:30.840 --> 23:33.550
Or,you get me the boat and
I'll tell you what I find.

23:33.560 --> 23:36.500
No boat trip,no boat. I'm part of this.

23:37.130 --> 23:38.880
- OK.
- Brilliant!

23:38.890 --> 23:41.060
- But you do as I say.
- Yeah,course.

23:41.070 --> 23:42.690
Listen,I was going to ask -

23:42.700 --> 23:45.610
promise me you won't laugh
- have you got any vacancies coming up?

23:45.620 --> 23:47.120
You know,with Torchwood.

23:47.130 --> 23:49.860
Cos I was thinking,I'm
great to work with.

23:49.870 --> 23:51.860
You know you could tip them the wink.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.080
Maybe. Yeah.

24:15.110 --> 24:16.340
What can I get you,lads?

24:16.360 --> 24:19.430
Two burgers and two cheeseburgers...

24:22.530 --> 24:23.860
Fifty quid.

24:23.870 --> 24:26.290
That's a bit steep,innit? Offer him 35.

24:26.300 --> 24:29.330
Gwen,I'm not being funny,if
you wanna haggle,go to Morocco.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.030
All right,50 quid.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.320
Open waves,here we come.

24:34.330 --> 24:36.100
Get us a couple of teas before we go.

24:36.110 --> 24:37.230
You're kidding?

24:37.860 --> 24:40.470
You're not kidding. I dunno...

24:45.680 --> 24:48.620
Do this for me and
I'll give you 100 quid.

25:00.990 --> 25:03.130
I'm sorry,Andy!

25:03.140 --> 25:05.310
Yeah,right!

25:06.380 --> 25:08.950
I'm sorry!

27:46.610 --> 27:48.320
All right!

27:48.900 --> 27:50.970
'Who are you?'

27:50.980 --> 27:55.150
Torchwood,access code 474317432.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.560
I'm with Jack Harkness.

27:56.570 --> 27:59.270
He's supposed to warn
us about visitors. '

27:59.280 --> 28:01.420
Law unto himself,isn't he?

28:07.630 --> 28:10.780
And he knows we'll always forgive him.

28:36.360 --> 28:41.780
In the bush,those that stand out can
become immediate targets for predators,

28:41.790 --> 28:46.190
At late February the population
has reached its former strength... '

28:49.390 --> 28:51.530
This your first time?

28:52.310 --> 28:55.460
We all find it difficult at first.

28:55.470 --> 28:58.130
Are you looking for
anyone in particular?

28:58.140 --> 28:59.890
Yes.

29:01.260 --> 29:02.900
How many people are down here?

29:02.910 --> 29:05.060
Didn't he tell you?

29:08.260 --> 29:09.880
What's that?

29:16.230 --> 29:17.400
Is he OK?

29:17.410 --> 29:20.080
We do our best to help him.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.300
Caroline...

29:32.860 --> 29:34.480
Sorry,but why are they...?

29:34.490 --> 29:37.060
MISSING HAVE YOU SEEN CAROLINE?

29:42.030 --> 29:44.120
Are you all right?

29:44.700 --> 29:46.520
Oh,my God...

29:47.080 --> 29:49.120
They're here.

29:49.410 --> 29:52.000
What are you doing to them?
What's going on here? Tell me!

29:52.010 --> 29:54.420
I'll take it from here,Helen.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.490
It was lanto,wasn't it?

29:56.500 --> 29:57.510
What are you doing?

29:57.520 --> 29:58.130
I can explain.

29:58.140 --> 30:01.360
No,no,no,no,no,no.
You stay away from me!

30:01.370 --> 30:02.650
Let's go outside...

30:02.660 --> 30:04.370
These are the people taken by the rift!

30:04.380 --> 30:06.170
What are they doing
here? What have you done?

30:06.180 --> 30:08.510
Gwen,listen to me.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.300
He's here.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.810
He's been here all along.

30:12.820 --> 30:13.750
It's not that simple.

30:13.760 --> 30:14.460
Open it!

30:14.470 --> 30:16.690
- Gwen,before I...
- Now!

30:46.000 --> 30:47.630
Hello?

30:53.290 --> 30:55.140
Jonah?

31:01.250 --> 31:03.740
I'm looking for Jonah.

31:03.750 --> 31:05.490
Why?

31:09.750 --> 31:11.950
Am I in the right room?

31:17.340 --> 31:20.910
Yes. I'm Jonah.

31:31.010 --> 31:33.060
I'm sorry. I must be in the wrong room.

31:33.070 --> 31:37.810
The Jonah Bevan I'm looking for is 15 years
old and he went missing from the Barrage.

31:37.820 --> 31:40.350
That was me.

31:44.790 --> 31:46.810
Who are you?

31:46.820 --> 31:49.400
My name is Gwen Cooper...

31:49.410 --> 31:53.380
and I'm with Torchwood.
What... What's happened to you?

31:55.150 --> 31:57.870
I was walking home.

32:01.350 --> 32:04.060
There was a light.

32:07.270 --> 32:13.400
I woke up and the land was on
fire,there were flames,for miles on end.

32:13.890 --> 32:16.480
A man pulled me from the flames.

32:16.490 --> 32:21.440
Took me to a building,where
they tried to work on the burns.

32:22.420 --> 32:25.280
I thought I was going to die.

32:26.220 --> 32:30.310
I don't remember when the
ground started shaking,

32:30.320 --> 32:34.190
and then I realised it
wasn't a building after all.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.440
It was a rescue craft.

32:36.450 --> 32:40.770
The last off a burning planet.

32:41.610 --> 32:45.750
We watched the Solar System burn.

32:46.250 --> 32:49.350
It was so beautiful.

32:53.530 --> 32:57.270
I am so sorry for
what's happened to you.

33:01.850 --> 33:05.520
Can I trust you to tell the truth?

33:10.630 --> 33:12.900
Of course.

33:12.910 --> 33:15.380
Am I really home?

33:15.390 --> 33:18.030
Yes. You're home.

33:18.490 --> 33:20.040
Thank you.

33:23.540 --> 33:28.200
Jonah,I've come because your
mother is still looking for you.

33:29.170 --> 33:30.120
She's still alive?

33:30.130 --> 33:32.270
You've only been gone for seven months.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.700
She never stopped looking.

33:33.710 --> 33:36.360
I tried so hard to come home.

33:36.860 --> 33:38.640
I was lost so long.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.400
You're safe now,you are safe.

33:41.410 --> 33:42.480
Can I see her?

33:42.490 --> 33:44.040
Can you bring her here?

33:44.050 --> 33:46.670
Is that what you want?

33:59.660 --> 34:02.880
When I took over Torchwood,there
were two,just like Jonah.

34:02.890 --> 34:05.600
Ravaged from falling through the rift.

34:05.610 --> 34:08.940
Being kept in the vaults,neglected.

34:09.230 --> 34:11.850
I wanted them looked after.

34:11.860 --> 34:13.659
I set this place up.

34:13.670 --> 34:17.460
Told the staff these were
experiments gone wrong.

34:18.679 --> 34:20.239
How many are there?

34:20.250 --> 34:22.840
Seventeen,last count.

34:25.300 --> 34:28.010
It's increased over the last year.

34:28.020 --> 34:30.120
Like the rift is trying
to correct its mistakes.

34:30.130 --> 34:32.449
But not all the missing return.

34:32.830 --> 34:33.530
No.

34:33.540 --> 34:34.500
You can't keep them hidden.

34:34.560 --> 34:36.670
They have families
who deserve to know...

34:36.679 --> 34:38.790
Gwen,they're sick.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.600
In ways you could never imagine.

34:42.360 --> 34:43.980
We can't fix them.

34:43.989 --> 34:46.610
We just care for them.

34:47.090 --> 34:48.770
Jonah's asked me to bring Nikki here.

34:48.780 --> 34:49.949
- No.
- She has a right to know.

34:49.960 --> 34:50.570
No way.

34:50.580 --> 34:52.770
She said not knowing is the worst part.

34:52.780 --> 34:56.320
How are you going to tell her her
child has aged 40 years in seven months?

34:56.330 --> 34:58.230
That he's scarred,that he
can't look after himself...

34:58.240 --> 35:01.530
We don't have the right
to hide it from her!

35:01.540 --> 35:04.960
If you tell her,you have to tell
her about the rift and Torchwood.

35:04.970 --> 35:06.100
Then I will.

35:06.110 --> 35:07.190
What if she doesn't believe you?

35:07.200 --> 35:10.140
I have to try. We owe her the truth.

35:10.150 --> 35:13.540
Jack,if you'd lost
someone,wouldn't you want to know?

35:18.290 --> 35:21.830
Let me try. Please.

35:42.900 --> 35:44.950
We've got another meeting on Tuesday.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.650
Will you come to that,or..?

35:55.570 --> 35:58.740
You're not here for small talk.

35:58.750 --> 36:01.210
I've found Jonah.

36:02.580 --> 36:04.570
- Is he dead?
- No.

36:04.580 --> 36:05.830
Is he hurt?

36:05.840 --> 36:07.530
- We're looking after him.
- Where?

36:07.540 --> 36:09.530
Can I see him?

36:10.100 --> 36:11.710
Yes.

36:18.690 --> 36:20.380
Sorry.

36:22.440 --> 36:25.890
There are things I
have to tell you first.

36:26.220 --> 36:29.420
And all I'm asking is you trust me.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.750
Andy,I know you hate me right now. '

36:34.760 --> 36:35.480
I'm hanging up.

36:35.490 --> 36:37.510
No,please don't. It's about Nikki.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.630
- I found Jonah.
- Where?

36:39.640 --> 36:40.750
I can't tell you that. '

36:40.760 --> 36:42.050
Oh,here we go again!

36:42.060 --> 36:43.870
Piss off,why don't you?

36:43.880 --> 36:47.570
I've got Nikki with me. I've told her
about Torchwood and about what we do.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.920
I need you to confirm to her that
I'm not mad or dangerous or a liar.

36:50.930 --> 36:52.800
You used me,Gwen.

36:52.810 --> 36:53.920
I'm sorry.

36:53.930 --> 36:55.130
That's how you see me,isn't it?'

36:55.140 --> 36:58.550
Occasionally useful. Worth stringing
along,in case I can ever help you.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.410
Andy... '

37:00.420 --> 37:03.100
You'd never recommend for me
to join Torchwood,would you?

37:03.110 --> 37:04.690
No.

37:05.560 --> 37:06.560
Thank you.

37:06.570 --> 37:08.750
I want to take Nikki to see Jonah.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.010
But you've got to tell
her she can trust me.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.490
We can fix this,Andy. We
can make it right. '

37:15.750 --> 37:18.020
Put her on.

37:19.290 --> 37:20.760
Nikki...

37:22.510 --> 37:24.660
Andy?

38:03.390 --> 38:05.440
OK...

38:06.270 --> 38:08.550
.. where is he?

38:12.640 --> 38:14.870
Remember what I said. You
won't recognise him at first.

38:14.880 --> 38:15.570
I know.

38:15.580 --> 38:17.720
He's aged. He's been injured...

38:17.730 --> 38:20.100
I just want to see him.

38:20.110 --> 38:21.850
You understand what
I've told you now,Nikki.

38:21.860 --> 38:24.220
- He's not a child any more.
- It doesn't matter.

38:24.230 --> 38:26.380
I have to see him.

38:27.870 --> 38:29.870
Let me see him.

38:31.750 --> 38:33.430
OK.

38:38.490 --> 38:40.590
Hello?

38:40.900 --> 38:43.080
Jonah?

38:43.090 --> 38:45.560
Yes?

38:47.810 --> 38:50.500
I can't see you.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.970
Jonah?

38:56.730 --> 38:58.940
- Mum?
- No.

38:58.950 --> 39:00.930
- No!
- It's OK,Mum,it's me,it's OK.

39:00.940 --> 39:02.030
Stay away!

39:02.040 --> 39:04.510
I'm sorry,I'm really,really sorry.

39:04.520 --> 39:07.010
What're you doing? What
have you done to me?

39:07.020 --> 39:09.190
Nikki,I promise,this is Jonah.

39:09.200 --> 39:13.240
That is not my son!

39:13.740 --> 39:15.740
Get me out,I want to get out of here.

39:15.750 --> 39:17.040
Will you listen? This is him.

39:17.050 --> 39:17.770
You are sick!

39:17.780 --> 39:18.770
- Listen...
- All of you!

39:18.780 --> 39:20.900
Did you fix my wardrobe door?

39:20.910 --> 39:23.920
We bought it
flat-pack,made it together.

39:24.510 --> 39:26.450
The bottom hinge comes loose.

39:26.460 --> 39:28.200
- You said you'd sort it.
- No.

39:28.210 --> 39:30.120
Every evening you buy a bottle of beer.

39:30.130 --> 39:33.240
- You let me sneak one sip.
- Stop it!

39:33.250 --> 39:36.110
- You've two alarms cos you sleep through the first.
- Make him stop!

39:36.120 --> 39:40.400
You talk about when you can earn decent
money and afford some decent make-up.

39:40.410 --> 39:41.540
I'm not hearing this!

39:41.550 --> 39:45.110
You won't buy me a double bed cos you
don't understand what I need it for.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.410
Shut up!

39:46.420 --> 39:48.580
When I ask why you haven't
got married,you say,

39:48.590 --> 39:52.000
"I'll never be lonely,cos
I've always got you. "

39:54.490 --> 39:58.880
It's me,Mum. It's me.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.300
Jonah?

40:13.170 --> 40:15.150
I feel so lost.

40:15.510 --> 40:18.650
I've walked for
years,trying to get home.

40:19.170 --> 40:20.620
I'm sorry.

40:20.800 --> 40:21.650
Why?

40:21.660 --> 40:26.710
That night. I was late. I'm sorry.

40:41.730 --> 40:44.280
The sights I've seen,Mum.

40:44.290 --> 40:46.220
It's fine!

40:49.710 --> 40:51.610
It'll take time.

40:51.620 --> 40:53.970
Look... It'll be OK.

40:54.610 --> 40:57.900
You have to leave Jonah now.

40:59.790 --> 41:02.300
- What?
- Helen,I'm fine.

41:02.310 --> 41:03.830
It's for your own benefit.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.220
No. I'm taking him home now.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.420
Nikki,stop for a second.
You can't just take him out.

41:08.430 --> 41:10.600
I know how to look after my child.

41:10.610 --> 41:13.350
I'll tell them he's my father.

41:13.610 --> 41:14.960
I can take care of him...!

41:14.970 --> 41:15.900
We can't allow that.

41:15.910 --> 41:19.300
He's my son,I say what's allowed!

41:19.310 --> 41:20.880
Jonah?

41:20.890 --> 41:22.700
- It's started again.
- What's happening?

41:22.710 --> 41:24.870
He's starting the downswing.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.650
What's a downswing?

41:26.930 --> 41:28.750
What is it? Jonah?

41:28.760 --> 41:30.680
You've seen him in the good phase.

41:30.690 --> 41:32.470
It gets briefer every day.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.420
It really might be best if you leave.

41:34.430 --> 41:35.350
Helen...

41:35.720 --> 41:37.370
Oh,it's all right,sweetheart,I'm here.

41:37.380 --> 41:38.140
Make it stop!

41:38.150 --> 41:39.700
I ever wish I could.

41:39.710 --> 41:42.620
Please,it would be
better if you didn't stay.

41:42.630 --> 41:45.440
- I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving him.
- OK.

41:45.450 --> 41:46.820
Then you should move away.

41:46.830 --> 41:50.200
Why?Will you tell me why?!

42:08.270 --> 42:11.560
I'd never heard a sound like it.

42:12.310 --> 42:15.500
This primal howl.

42:16.820 --> 42:21.080
The scream lasts 20 hours every day.

42:25.980 --> 42:30.900
Before the rift returned him,Jonah had
looked into the heart of a dark star.

42:32.020 --> 42:35.890
What he'd seen had driven him mad. '

42:38.570 --> 42:41.050
One Week Later

42:43.850 --> 42:46.140
They say you can visit...

42:46.150 --> 42:48.330
whenever you like.

42:48.340 --> 42:51.420
When he's in a good phase.

42:51.430 --> 42:55.030
Promise me you won't
do this to anyone else.

42:56.540 --> 42:58.790
Before,I had the memory.

43:00.290 --> 43:02.630
Whenever I thought of him,I'd
see him laughing with his mates,

43:02.640 --> 43:06.220
playing football,scoffing his breakfast.

43:06.230 --> 43:08.860
And now I just hear that...

43:10.210 --> 43:13.180
that terrible noise.

43:13.190 --> 43:16.110
- I thought you wanted to know what happened to him.
- I did.

43:17.250 --> 43:19.630
I was wrong.

43:21.830 --> 43:24.680
It was better when I didn't know.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.430
Before you...

43:28.220 --> 43:31.140
I had hope.

45:49.450 --> 45:51.630
Apology,is it?

45:54.220 --> 45:57.920
Tonight,we talk about what YOU want.

45:59.030 --> 46:01.840
Kids...

46:02.310 --> 46:06.020
.. the future,anything you want.

46:09.320 --> 46:11.610
Are you all right?

46:15.240 --> 46:17.860
Hey,come here.

46:22.890 --> 46:25.090
I'm sorry...!

46:34.020 --> 46:36.510
Do you want to sit down?

46:38.090 --> 46:39.540
OK.

46:52.030 --> 46:53.860
Now then...

46:54.680 --> 46:57.250
you tell me everything.

46:57.260 --> 46:59.890
From the beginning.

47:04.670 --> 47:07.340
There's this woman,Nikki.

47:10.410 --> 47:13.200
She had a son...

47:14.040 --> 47:16.680
.. Jonah.

47:18.110 --> 47:21.820
He went missing seven months ago...

47:26.540 --> 47:29.010
Some people believe that in
the moments before your death,

47:29.020 --> 47:32.070
your life flashes before your eyes.

47:45.580 --> 47:47.980
Explosive devices.
