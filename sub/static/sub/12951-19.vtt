00:01.234 --> 00:02.501
Previously on "Alias"...

00:02.502 --> 00:03.569
Neil Caplan.

00:03.570 --> 00:05.704
He's a mathematician
out of Caltech.

00:05.705 --> 00:07.806
The bureau confirmed
he and his family

00:07.807 --> 00:10.332
were kidnapped from the
Long Beach aquarium yesterday.

00:15.248 --> 00:19.207
If you want me to help you,
you let my family go.

00:19.285 --> 00:20.719
AII I need to know now

00:20.720 --> 00:22.588
is whether you want
to come with me.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.089
Yes.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074

01:23.316 --> 01:25.117
I didn't have a clean shot.

01:25.118 --> 01:27.618
And I took it anyway.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.760
I'm putting in for reassignment

01:34.761 --> 01:37.286
to the directorate
of Intelligence.

01:37.363 --> 01:40.730
If I had the shot,
I might have taken it.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.935
I know what Emily meant to you.

01:49.976 --> 01:52.476
I'm sorry.

01:57.484 --> 01:59.984
Arvin?

02:00.587 --> 02:03.087
Arvin?

02:05.692 --> 02:07.793
This plan might not hold up.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.428
The CIA knows too much.

02:09.429 --> 02:13.365
They could guess why we were
after the genetic database.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.933
I'm not interested
in the database.

02:17.237 --> 02:20.468
I want satellite footage
of Tuscany.

02:20.573 --> 02:23.599
I want to know
who murdered my wife.

02:26.913 --> 02:30.576
We both had to make
sacrifices, Arvin.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.150
You won't forgive yourself
if you stop now.

02:33.186 --> 02:36.553
We're so close to knowing
what Rambaldi knew.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.925
I wish I never heard
that man's name.

02:49.936 --> 02:52.837
Good news, relatively speaking.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.500
Using the administrative codes
we acquired at Brucker,

02:55.608 --> 02:58.543
I was able to download
a copy of the database.

02:58.611 --> 03:00.012
But it's still encrypted?

03:00.013 --> 03:02.914
Yes. Although Neil Caplan's
still analyzing

03:02.982 --> 03:05.217
the remainder
of the Rambaldi text,

03:05.218 --> 03:08.915
his background should allow him
to crack the algorithms.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.925
I don't understand
how we don't have

03:12.926 --> 03:14.459
a single lead on Sloane or Mom.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.161
There's a difference
between intelligence

03:16.162 --> 03:17.796
and actionable intelligence.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.298
What about the earrings
Mom left me?

03:19.299 --> 03:20.966
Analysis couldn't trace
the source.

03:20.967 --> 03:23.800
Marshall's trying to figure out
how they receive anything.

03:23.903 --> 03:25.504
We have to get ahead of them.

03:25.505 --> 03:27.239
We know they're acquiring
Rambaldi artifacts.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.508
We know they tried
to access a DNA database.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.343
There must be some way to
predict what they're gonna do.

03:31.344 --> 03:34.677
I understand your frustration
in light of Emily's death.

03:34.747 --> 03:37.739
But sometimes there isn't
a clear move to make.

03:37.817 --> 03:39.851
Look at this.

03:39.852 --> 03:41.787
Elsa Caplan's
debrief transcript.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.455
It's barely 10 pages long.

03:43.456 --> 03:45.624
Sloane kidnapped her husband
2 months ago.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.426
All we have are 10 pages?

03:47.427 --> 03:49.628
If you feel Elsa Caplan
was improperly debriefed,

03:49.629 --> 03:52.129
do it again yourself.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.266
How's your son?

03:54.267 --> 03:56.735
He's keeping me sane.

03:57.904 --> 04:01.362
Even with the security detail,
it's hard to feel safe.

04:01.474 --> 04:04.500
I don't want to make this
more difficult for you.

04:04.611 --> 04:07.111
But I need a little more
of your help.

04:08.448 --> 04:11.178
I'd like to bring you in for
a regression-therapy session.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.185
It's like hypnosis.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.848
It's completely safe.
I've done it myself.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.954
No offense,
but I don't feel comfortable

04:20.026 --> 04:22.859
with the government
poking around in my head.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.429
I'll be honest with you.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.000
We're out of leads.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.102
What are you saying?

04:30.103 --> 04:32.765
That if something happens
to him, it's my fault?

04:32.872 --> 04:33.872
Of course not.

04:33.873 --> 04:36.141
These people threatened
to kill my son.

04:36.142 --> 04:38.310
- He's still having nightmares.
- Wait.

04:38.311 --> 04:40.312
You come and tell me
I'm not doing enough?

04:40.313 --> 04:43.180
- That's not what I meant.
- Aaron, come on.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.017
It's time to go.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.518
How dare you.

04:48.521 --> 04:51.021
Sweetie, honey, it's time to go.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.869
We still need your help.

05:05.905 --> 05:08.601
I've just downloaded this.

05:08.708 --> 05:11.438
It's a catalog of over
10 million people's DNA.

05:11.511 --> 05:15.106
We're looking for someone
specific. A man.

05:15.181 --> 05:17.215
But it's encrypted.

05:17.216 --> 05:18.850
We need you to break it.

05:18.851 --> 05:20.952
For the past two months,

05:20.953 --> 05:23.021
I haven't heard a word
about my family

05:23.022 --> 05:25.547
or been given any indication

05:25.625 --> 05:29.152
whether they're dead
or alive, so...

05:29.228 --> 05:31.728
you can just kill me.

05:31.798 --> 05:34.066
Just kill me,
'cause there's no way

05:34.067 --> 05:35.834
I'm gonna help you anymore.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.402
What if I told you

05:37.403 --> 05:40.372
that your family's
not only alive,

05:40.440 --> 05:42.940
but we let them go?

05:44.243 --> 05:46.743
Call your house.

05:47.613 --> 05:50.113
Call.

05:59.459 --> 06:00.726
Hello?

06:00.727 --> 06:03.061
Elsa! It's me.

06:03.062 --> 06:04.229
Hello?

06:04.230 --> 06:05.397
Elsa!

06:05.398 --> 06:06.932
Elsa, I'm alive.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.400
She can't hear you.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.369
I've modified the cellphone.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.737
Hello?

06:11.738 --> 06:13.739
They're home.
They're safe.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.538
Now you have something
to live for, Mr. Caplan.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.114
Elsa Caplan was living

06:22.115 --> 06:24.615
under protective custody
for two months.

06:24.650 --> 06:28.211
I was so convinced that
we were overlooking something

06:28.287 --> 06:29.621
that I went there and implied

06:29.622 --> 06:32.122
that she wasn't doing enough
to save her husband.

06:32.158 --> 06:33.725
How stupid.

06:33.726 --> 06:37.025
No one's harder on themselves
than you are.

06:37.096 --> 06:40.088
# When I wake up
to a sky so blue #

06:40.166 --> 06:42.999
# With my girlfriend
in the other room #

06:43.069 --> 06:46.163
# Got the coffee on,
the pancakes turned #

06:46.272 --> 06:49.173
# The cat's sleeping outside
in the sun #

06:49.242 --> 06:51.543
# The TV sings
its morning blues #

06:51.544 --> 06:54.672
# And it's all the same
with all the news #

06:54.747 --> 06:57.375
# But she walks up and smiles #

06:57.450 --> 07:00.510
# And kisses me and says,
"Your coffee's done" #

07:00.586 --> 07:02.954
# Starts singing #

07:02.955 --> 07:06.447
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

07:10.229 --> 07:12.063
Vaughn, I mean, okay.

07:12.064 --> 07:14.166
The backpack
is getting ridiculous.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.667
What do you mean?

07:18.204 --> 07:20.505
The middle drawer...

07:20.506 --> 07:21.640
it's yours.

07:21.641 --> 07:24.542
# Well,
it's a pretty good day #

07:24.610 --> 07:28.671
# I'm looking forward
to tomorrow #

07:28.748 --> 07:30.715
- Yeah?
- It's just a drawer.

07:30.716 --> 07:33.981
I'm just saying
it's a great idea.

07:34.053 --> 07:36.553
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

08:03.082 --> 08:05.582
I love my drawer.

08:14.060 --> 08:17.257
If we're gonna keep working,
I need to make a sandwich.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.280
Vaughn?

08:38.650 --> 08:41.019
There were three calls made
from the same number

08:41.020 --> 08:43.544
to Caplan's house
over the last year.

08:44.757 --> 08:47.749
They came exactly
four months apart.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.028
They were all made
on a Monday night

08:50.029 --> 08:52.529
at the same time.

08:53.065 --> 08:55.066
And they all lasted one minute.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.635
Where did the calls come from?

08:56.636 --> 08:58.136
I need to talk to you.

08:58.137 --> 08:59.571
Is it Neil?

08:59.572 --> 09:01.239
Before Neil's abduction,

09:01.240 --> 09:03.341
three calls were made
to your house over the last year

09:03.342 --> 09:04.576
at odd hours.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.444
We traced the number
to a reporter

09:06.445 --> 09:09.141
named Gregory Ivanov.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.683
Does that name
mean anything to you?

09:11.684 --> 09:13.285
No.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.053
We ran a background check.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.155
He was a journalist
out of Los Angeles

09:17.156 --> 09:20.319
for Itar-Tass, a news service
known for giving cover

09:20.393 --> 09:22.594
to Russian Intelligence agents.

09:22.595 --> 09:25.095
This man, Ivanov...

09:25.131 --> 09:26.698
we think he's one of them.

09:26.699 --> 09:29.566
We put Ivanov under
electronic surveillance.

09:29.635 --> 09:32.627
An hour ago, he received a fax
from an unknown source.

09:32.705 --> 09:34.105
I don't understand.

09:34.106 --> 09:38.042
Your husband may have been
working for the Russian SVR.

09:38.110 --> 09:41.546
It's their equivalent
to the CIA.

09:43.783 --> 09:46.283
What did the fax say?

09:47.954 --> 09:50.355
A single Russian word...

09:50.356 --> 09:52.856
"razvyaska. "

09:55.695 --> 09:58.195
It means "endgame. "

10:10.176 --> 10:11.977
Neil's gonna die.

10:11.978 --> 10:14.478
- Elsa, we don't know that.
- No.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.980
I do.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.451
Not you?

10:22.188 --> 10:23.688
I didn't want to be hypnotized

10:23.689 --> 10:26.283
because I was afraid
you'd find out.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.760
Ivanov was my handler.

10:28.761 --> 10:32.458
Seven years ago, I was ordered
to seduce and marry Neil.

10:32.531 --> 10:36.262
My objective was to keep tabs
on his work.

10:36.335 --> 10:39.395
I was given a tracking device
to implant in his arm.

10:39.505 --> 10:41.539
But it has a secondary purpose.

10:41.540 --> 10:44.441
It was designed to release
50 milligrams of cyanide

10:44.510 --> 10:47.010
into his bloodstream.

10:47.747 --> 10:50.272
It's a suicide pill.

10:50.349 --> 10:52.684
That's what the fax was about.

10:52.685 --> 10:55.185
It means it's been activated.

10:59.925 --> 11:02.027
You're not authorized
to be telling me this?

11:02.028 --> 11:04.528
I've just committed treason
against my government

11:04.597 --> 11:07.097
because I want to get him back.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.997
I'm telling you
because I love him.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.773
I have a lead
on Sloane and Irina.

11:48.774 --> 11:51.176
- We have to move immediately.
- Vaughn briefed me.

11:51.177 --> 11:53.611
Elsa Caplan shouldn't be
processed as a walk-in.

11:53.612 --> 11:54.713
She's an SVR agent.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.148
Which means we can classify her
as a defector.

11:57.149 --> 11:59.913
Or we can arrest her
and try her for espionage.

11:59.985 --> 12:01.886
Until we make that
determination, I'm holding her.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.354
She wants to help.

12:03.355 --> 12:05.880
She implanted a tracking chip
in her husband.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.759
The chip's activated by a code.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.128
If we get a locating device,
we can enter the code,

12:10.129 --> 12:13.257
find him, and remove the device
before it releases the cyanide.

12:13.332 --> 12:15.433
I've asked Marshall
to look into the possibility

12:15.434 --> 12:16.634
of reverse-engineering
a locator.

12:16.635 --> 12:18.603
It'll take him three days.

12:18.604 --> 12:19.971
Caplan will be dead by then.

12:19.972 --> 12:23.339
The chip's set to release
cyanide in 42 hours.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.810
There's a black-market contact
who deals in SVR contraband.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.078
I'm going to meet him.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.213
I'm not willing
to risk your life

12:28.214 --> 12:31.183
based on speculative intel
you acquired from a Russian spy.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.451
- Why would she lie?
- That's the question.

12:33.452 --> 12:36.216
- She turned herself in.
- She's not the first.

12:38.824 --> 12:41.292
I realize we're talking
about a Russian agent

12:41.293 --> 12:43.094
who betrayed her husband,

12:43.095 --> 12:46.622
but Elsa Caplan and my mother
are not the same person.

12:46.699 --> 12:50.100
Elsa's first instinct,
her first thought,

12:50.169 --> 12:52.370
was for her husband's life.

12:52.371 --> 12:54.239
That's your assessment.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.471
If we find Neil Caplan,
we find Sloane and Derevko.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.010
Isn't that worth the risk?

12:59.011 --> 13:02.503
We'll move on Elsa's statement
only if we can corroborate it.

13:02.581 --> 13:04.282
When did you
start playing it safe?

13:04.283 --> 13:06.184
You let Derevko walk out of here

13:06.185 --> 13:08.813
because you thought
she could lead us to Sloane.

13:08.888 --> 13:12.085
A mistake I'm not anxious
to repeat.

13:12.158 --> 13:13.925
And if Neil Caplan dies?

13:13.926 --> 13:16.426
Then he dies.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.309
Who has my son?

13:32.378 --> 13:35.370
- He's being taken care of.
- I thought you believed me.

13:35.447 --> 13:37.649
- I do believe you.
- Why am I in this cell?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.017
I risked everything,

13:39.018 --> 13:41.386
committed treason against
my own government.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.887
It's not that simple.
There are protocols to follow.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.356
This is Director Bristow.

13:45.357 --> 13:48.053
I want solitary confinement
imposed on Elsa Caplan.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.228
No unapproved visitors.
Understood?

13:50.229 --> 13:52.729
We still have 42 hours.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.767
We're doing
everything we can...

13:55.768 --> 13:57.335
Elsa, don't react.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.237
You're listening
to a recorded message

13:59.238 --> 14:02.173
being transmitted through
a directional sound projector.

14:02.274 --> 14:04.676
You're the only one
who can hear this.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.646
The CIA won't sanction a team
to get the locator.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.514
I'm going in myself.

14:09.515 --> 14:13.144
I know none of this is much
of a consolation to you...

14:13.219 --> 14:15.486
I need you to give me
the locator codes.

14:15.487 --> 14:18.888
Cross your arms and tap
them out in Morse code.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.001
Back away
from the glass, please.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.569
I have authorization.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.070
Back up now.

14:36.508 --> 14:39.008
Thank you.

14:46.151 --> 14:48.353
It's been 24 hours.

14:48.354 --> 14:51.653
This database is encoded
with an 8192-bit

14:51.724 --> 14:54.693
military-grade
polymorphic encryption.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.524
Now, unless you want to kidnap
a smarter genius,

14:57.596 --> 14:59.197
it's gonna be a little while.

14:59.198 --> 15:01.698
Tell me what you need
to speed this up.

15:02.968 --> 15:07.302
I need access
to a Cray supercomputer.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.398
I hope you're not stalling,
Mr. Caplan.

15:10.509 --> 15:13.808
Because your safe return
to your family...

15:14.680 --> 15:17.180
...is no guarantee.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.084
Understand?

15:25.891 --> 15:28.391
Aah!

15:32.298 --> 15:34.065
- A few days ago...
- Oh, my leg!

15:34.066 --> 15:36.234
I would have done anything
to keep you alive.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.235
My leg...

15:37.236 --> 15:40.103
And now... I don't care.

15:40.205 --> 15:41.372
Arvin.

15:41.373 --> 15:43.308
Arvin.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.809
Arvin, don't.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.611
We still need him.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.915
My leg.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.057
Where would you
be transferred to?

16:03.128 --> 16:06.894
I'll be reassigned
within the agency,

16:06.966 --> 16:10.959
maybe to Texas or D.C.

16:13.505 --> 16:16.005
I'd be an analyst.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.009
I would be safe.

16:18.010 --> 16:20.510
You'd be happy
not being in the field?

16:22.114 --> 16:23.915
I'd be happy.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.544
As long as you and the kids
are with me.

16:26.618 --> 16:30.384
Sloane's the man who ran SD-6.

16:30.456 --> 16:33.220
The one who lied to you
for years.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.260
Marcus.

16:37.796 --> 16:41.527
You are not responsible
for what happened to his wife.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.125
He put her in harm's way.

16:45.304 --> 16:49.070
That's not the only reason
I'm putting in for the transfer.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.343
I'm doing it for us.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.543
When you first told me
the truth,

17:01.620 --> 17:04.180
I said I didn't know
who you were.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.458
I was wrong.

17:07.459 --> 17:09.959
I just didn't know what you did.

17:10.628 --> 17:13.564
I have always known who you are.

17:14.465 --> 17:18.698
You are the most decent man
I know.

17:18.804 --> 17:21.364
Whatever you decide...

17:21.473 --> 17:23.973
I'll be with you.

17:30.015 --> 17:31.315
Hello?

17:31.316 --> 17:32.550
It's me.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.485
Is your source still in place?

17:34.486 --> 17:35.753
Yes.

17:35.754 --> 17:38.122
Good.

17:38.123 --> 17:40.623
I need something from him.

17:54.740 --> 17:58.506
Base Ops, this is Trailer.
We have a 20 on the target.

17:58.577 --> 18:01.077
Copy. Stay with her.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.377
We're gonna head over
to the Pi Delta exchange.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.250
I think Tom's gonna be there.

18:39.251 --> 18:40.685
Shut up.

18:40.686 --> 18:43.186
Ooh! Tommy!

18:46.725 --> 18:48.092
She gave you a drawer, huh?

18:48.093 --> 18:50.394
It was a gesture of convenience.

18:50.395 --> 18:52.797
And what did you put in it?

18:52.798 --> 18:54.799
- Why do you care?
- Why do I care?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.801
Do you know how spoiled you are?

18:56.802 --> 18:59.302
I wish I had
a girlfriend to say,

18:59.338 --> 19:00.938
"Hey, you want a drawer?"

19:00.939 --> 19:02.807
I'll give you a drawer
at my place.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.308
I don't want a drawer
in your place.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.409
Hello?

19:05.410 --> 19:06.911
Hey, it's me.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.546
You okay?

19:08.547 --> 19:11.047
Marshall told me your father
shut you down.

19:11.049 --> 19:13.549
I just needed
to get out, cool down.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.653
Dad was right.
Like that's news.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.955
I just wish there was more
I could do.

19:17.956 --> 19:19.924
We're working
on corroborating Elsa's intel.

19:19.925 --> 19:20.925
Where are you?

19:20.926 --> 19:24.327
At the drugstore, picking up
some pictures I had developed.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.430
I think there's this
great one of us.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.991
You could hang it in your
hallway by the coatrack.

19:29.067 --> 19:30.401
What?

19:30.402 --> 19:32.902
Although some of the pictures
might not come out

19:32.938 --> 19:35.438
because I used the wrong
film speed.

19:36.642 --> 19:40.100
Next time,
he said to keep in mind

19:40.212 --> 19:42.346
I should use a slower roll.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.881
Pen.

19:43.882 --> 19:46.117
I'll probably be
another 20 minutes.

19:46.118 --> 19:47.785
I'll come over when I'm done?

19:47.786 --> 19:49.554
Yeah. Okay. Bye.

19:49.555 --> 19:52.055
Okay. Bye.

19:53.926 --> 19:54.659
What?

19:54.660 --> 19:57.629
She said she wanted to hang a
picture next to the coatrack.

19:57.696 --> 19:58.429
So?

19:58.430 --> 20:02.025
She's never been to my place.
I don't have a coatrack.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.135
Maybe it was
some kind of message.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.169
What'd she say exactly?

20:05.170 --> 20:07.670
She said, "Keep in mind
I should use a slower roll. "

20:07.706 --> 20:10.800
Oh. And...

20:10.909 --> 20:12.877
this bag, please.

20:16.682 --> 20:19.182
Where's your bathroom?

20:47.679 --> 20:49.847
But I like it.
I like this product.

20:49.848 --> 20:52.510
- I've used this one before.
- You have?

20:52.584 --> 20:54.752
I tried that
once and broke out.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.354
Oh, really?

20:56.355 --> 20:57.521
Mm-hmm.

20:57.522 --> 21:00.022
Okay. Thanks.

21:00.459 --> 21:03.019
Oh, my... are you Sigma Gammas?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.595
Yeah!

21:04.596 --> 21:06.697
I was president of my chapter
in West Virginia.

21:06.698 --> 21:07.565
No way.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.533
I swear to God!

21:09.534 --> 21:10.768
President?

21:10.769 --> 21:12.837
- Yeah.
- Wow.

21:12.838 --> 21:15.338
You still have the exchange
with the Pi Delts?

21:15.407 --> 21:17.608
- Yes, we do.
- You wanna come?

21:17.609 --> 21:19.844
- Can I?
- Absolutely.

21:19.845 --> 21:22.179
I have been homesick
since I graduated.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.680
Thank you for inviting me!

21:44.069 --> 21:45.202
Wait, I got it.

21:45.203 --> 21:46.804
She's using
skip-sequence ciphertext.

21:46.805 --> 21:50.138
Take the first letter from
every word and rearrange them.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.979
She's going to Russia.

22:03.021 --> 22:05.521
You wanted to see me?

22:07.592 --> 22:10.720
Sydney knew I was listening
to your phone conversation.

22:10.796 --> 22:13.492
She also knew by the time
I decoded her anagram,

22:13.565 --> 22:14.799
she'd be halfway to Russia.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.500
I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt

22:16.501 --> 22:18.202
and assume you had
every intention

22:18.203 --> 22:19.704
of reporting that to me.

22:19.705 --> 22:21.272
I'm giving you
this consideration

22:21.273 --> 22:24.037
because when Sydney
makes contact with you again,

22:24.109 --> 22:26.771
you're going to tell me
exactly where she is.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.246
If I'd known what she was doing,
I would have tried to stop her.

22:29.247 --> 22:30.381
Now that she's gone,

22:30.382 --> 22:32.216
there's nothing we can do
to change her mind.

22:32.217 --> 22:34.185
She's got 40 hours
to find Caplan.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.953
Why not give her backup?

22:35.954 --> 22:37.922
If it's not obvious
to you by now,

22:37.923 --> 22:41.154
everything I do is in the
service of protecting Sydney.

22:41.226 --> 22:44.161
For all we know, Elsa Caplan's
working with Sloane.

22:44.229 --> 22:46.230
For all we know,
she was a conspirator

22:46.231 --> 22:47.398
in her husband's abduction,

22:47.399 --> 22:49.734
which means Sydney could be
walking into a trap.

22:49.735 --> 22:52.465
Or she is about to save
Neil Caplan's life.

22:52.571 --> 22:55.071
This is not a debate.

22:56.007 --> 22:59.204
Just because you've gotten
comfortable with my daughter

22:59.277 --> 23:01.777
doesn't mean you should be
comfortable with me.

23:01.780 --> 23:05.409
If you don't report your next
contact with Sydney immediately,

23:05.484 --> 23:08.180
I will take action
that you will regret.

23:27.973 --> 23:31.909
Okay, partner,
let's get ready to ride.

23:31.977 --> 23:35.708
Hold up here.
Here you go!

23:41.052 --> 23:44.249
Get up! Get up!
You're no cowboy!

23:55.033 --> 23:57.900
This is cowboy bar.
Speak English.

23:57.969 --> 24:00.337
We have a mutual friend.

24:00.338 --> 24:01.305
I don't care.

24:01.306 --> 24:03.774
This is eight-seconds table.

24:03.775 --> 24:07.905
Everyone here has ridden bull
for eight seconds.

24:07.979 --> 24:10.479
Goodbye.

24:16.388 --> 24:18.888
Oh, God.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.088
Something like that?

24:51.089 --> 24:53.589
Something like that.

25:06.137 --> 25:09.265
Now, champion...

25:09.374 --> 25:11.375
who is our mutual friend?

25:11.376 --> 25:13.511
Elsa Caplan.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.479
When exactly did you talk
to Elsa?

25:15.480 --> 25:17.047
Yesterday.

25:17.048 --> 25:19.049
We are old friends.

25:19.050 --> 25:21.678
Elsa's parents were in
Kholokov's class

25:21.753 --> 25:23.354
at the red banner
with my parents.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.822
What do you need?

25:24.823 --> 25:26.590
I need a tracking device.

25:26.591 --> 25:28.492
Latest SVR issue.

25:28.493 --> 25:30.494
$50,000 cash.

25:30.495 --> 25:32.995
U.S. bucks only.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.531
Deal.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.538
Open the door.

25:52.450 --> 25:54.950
I want to see my son.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.800
Look, my family
is all I care about.

26:17.909 --> 26:21.174
Your family?

26:21.246 --> 26:23.147
The one you manufactured

26:23.148 --> 26:25.673
in order to steal
classified information?

26:25.750 --> 26:27.952
You don't know
anything about me.

26:27.953 --> 26:30.453
You couldn't be more wrong.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.725
You're Sydney's father.

26:34.726 --> 26:37.251
Irina Derevko was your wife.

26:37.329 --> 26:41.265
Which makes me an expert
on someone like you.

26:41.333 --> 26:44.825
It started as a job.

26:44.903 --> 26:47.104
A duty to your country.

26:47.105 --> 26:49.699
That it required you
to prostitute yourself

26:49.808 --> 26:53.266
was a small price to pay
for serving the motherland.

26:53.378 --> 26:55.512
At first,
everything went as planned.

26:55.513 --> 26:57.481
Then...

26:57.482 --> 26:59.383
surely an accident...

26:59.384 --> 27:00.818
you got pregnant.

27:00.819 --> 27:04.255
You considered terminating
the pregnancy, but...

27:04.322 --> 27:05.923
selfishly, you didn't.

27:05.924 --> 27:07.825
You hoped that becoming a mother

27:07.826 --> 27:10.351
would redeem you,
would absolve your guilt.

27:10.428 --> 27:13.625
- You're wrong!
- But you continued to lie

27:13.698 --> 27:16.166
and deceive
both your husband and son.

27:16.167 --> 27:18.667
I am not Irina Derevko!

27:18.670 --> 27:21.138
I probably care more
about your son than you do.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.869
- That is not true.
- If I have my way...

27:23.975 --> 27:26.210
you're never going to see
your son again.

27:26.211 --> 27:28.711
Don't you dare take my son
away from me!

27:28.813 --> 27:31.907
Don't you take my son away!

27:44.829 --> 27:46.597
Weiss.

27:46.598 --> 27:47.831
Weiss, it's me.

27:47.832 --> 27:50.000
Sorry to call you, but Vaughn's
phone is probably tapped.

27:50.001 --> 27:50.968
Is he there?

27:50.969 --> 27:52.036
Yeah.

27:52.037 --> 27:54.104
Guess who.

27:54.105 --> 27:55.272
- Syd?
- Listen to me.

27:55.273 --> 27:58.003
I've got the tracker.
I input the codes Elsa gave us.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.277
I found Caplan
in a building in Saria, Spain.

28:00.278 --> 28:01.912
It used to be
a software company.

28:01.913 --> 28:03.113
I'm on my way now.

28:03.114 --> 28:05.282
Your father thinks
you're walking into a trap.

28:05.283 --> 28:06.817
I'm not sure he's wrong.

28:06.818 --> 28:08.519
I'm supposed to convince you
to come home.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.154
I will, when I have Caplan.

28:10.155 --> 28:11.955
My father can't see straight
when he looks at Elsa.

28:11.956 --> 28:13.157
He only sees my mother.

28:13.158 --> 28:16.059
And if this ends up being
a mistake, so be it.

28:16.127 --> 28:17.361
I believe her.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.662
I'm coming with you.

28:18.663 --> 28:20.597
- I can't ask you to do that.
- You don't have to.

28:20.598 --> 28:22.733
There's an alley in Saria
behind the Gandara Hotel.

28:22.734 --> 28:25.234
Meet me there.

28:25.737 --> 28:27.838
Jack is gonna shoot you
in the face.

28:27.839 --> 28:29.239
Give me a half-hour head start.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.141
Tell him she called on your
phone, and you gave it to me.

28:31.142 --> 28:32.743
We only have 10 hours
to find Caplan.

28:32.744 --> 28:35.244
If we end up sharing
a cell in Federal Prison,

28:35.280 --> 28:37.780
I'm not giving you a drawer.

28:51.596 --> 28:53.464
Okay, I got to go.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.899
- I'm gonna be late.
- You work for a travel magazine.

28:55.900 --> 28:58.400
- Tell them you're traveling.
- I wish I could.

29:35.907 --> 29:37.341
- Ooh!
- I'm sorry.

29:37.342 --> 29:39.209
Uh, it's Will, right?

29:39.210 --> 29:41.378
- Yeah.
- I've seen you in the briefings.

29:41.379 --> 29:43.413
I'm kind of new
around here myself.

29:43.414 --> 29:45.249
Uh, it's Marshall Flinkman.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.450
Nice to meet you.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.752
Do they have you parking
in the Federal Annex?

29:48.753 --> 29:50.521
'Cause I have to walk
a half a mile

29:50.522 --> 29:53.787
to get here in the morning,
and I'm exhausted by the time...

29:53.858 --> 29:55.225
I shouldn't complain.

29:55.226 --> 29:57.494
It's the only exercise
I really get.

29:57.495 --> 29:59.530
Although I did see a gym.

29:59.531 --> 30:02.031
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.067
I got, uh...

30:04.068 --> 30:05.435
That's all right.

30:05.436 --> 30:07.271
Let's get some lunch
or something.

30:07.272 --> 30:09.072
- The CIA lunch.
- Hello?

30:09.073 --> 30:10.707
Hey, honey, you got a sec?

30:10.708 --> 30:12.376
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What's up?

30:12.377 --> 30:14.211
Are you near a computer?

30:14.212 --> 30:17.147
I was pulling up a recipe
on my laptop, and it crashed.

30:17.215 --> 30:19.715
What? Do you want me
to pull up a recipe?

30:19.717 --> 30:22.515
- Would you mind?
- Sure. What's the website?

30:22.587 --> 30:26.182
www. bouillabaisecentral. com.

30:27.225 --> 30:29.725
Okay.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.995
Okay, what do you need?

30:36.334 --> 30:38.894
Will you tell me
what kind of fish they list?

30:39.003 --> 30:41.503
Hold on.
Let me find it.

31:11.135 --> 31:12.936
Thank you for coming.

31:12.937 --> 31:15.372
How much time do we have?

31:15.373 --> 31:16.707
12 minutes.

31:16.708 --> 31:17.875
Did you bring gear?

31:17.876 --> 31:20.376
Did I bring gear?

31:20.612 --> 31:22.512
I spoke to Weiss
after we landed.

31:22.513 --> 31:24.548
Satellite's picked up five
figures inside the building.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.183
Basement level, north wing.

31:26.184 --> 31:28.684
Sloane could be
a block from here.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.020
My mother.

31:30.021 --> 31:32.356
If they are,
they won't surrender to us.

31:32.357 --> 31:34.857
I know.

31:35.260 --> 31:36.727
What about the perimeter?

31:36.728 --> 31:37.895
No activity.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.963
Roof access
will be our best bet.

31:39.964 --> 31:42.399
Not that I'm a fan
of you disobeying the CIA,

31:42.400 --> 31:43.867
but that was pretty good.

31:43.868 --> 31:46.368
The way you got away.

31:47.105 --> 31:49.605
Thank you.

32:38.556 --> 32:41.056
Yeah. It's me.

32:42.727 --> 32:45.525
I need you to do
something else for me.

32:57.175 --> 32:59.675
Who are you, anyway?

33:01.012 --> 33:04.607
What are you?
22? 23?

33:06.117 --> 33:09.143
What are you doing
working for a guy like Sloane?

33:11.556 --> 33:14.320
What do you expect to get
out of all of this?

33:19.664 --> 33:23.122
I was sent to school in England
at a very young age.

33:24.369 --> 33:27.827
Out of necessity,
one becomes self-reliant

33:27.905 --> 33:30.405
and, perhaps,
prematurely ambitious.

33:30.475 --> 33:33.808
I'm like anyone, Mr. Caplan.

33:33.878 --> 33:37.780
What I want is that
which I never had.

33:41.886 --> 33:44.446
You're gonna kill me,
aren't you?

33:44.522 --> 33:47.491
You wouldn't share
any of that stuff with me

33:47.558 --> 33:50.058
if you expected me to live.

33:52.930 --> 33:55.430
I suggest you keep working.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.639
I'll go around.

34:35.639 --> 34:38.139
Syd!

35:17.148 --> 35:18.682
Alto!

35:32.196 --> 35:34.264
Is Arvin Sloane
in this building?

35:34.265 --> 35:35.265
Or Irina Derevko?

35:35.266 --> 35:38.292
No, no, no, no.
But a blond guy just took off.

35:38.402 --> 35:40.003
- Sark?
- That's him, yeah.

35:40.004 --> 35:42.504
I'll go after him.

35:42.940 --> 35:45.275
What the hell's that for?

35:45.276 --> 35:47.444
You have to listen
to what I'm gonna say.

35:47.445 --> 35:50.039
You won't want to believe me,
but you have to,

35:50.114 --> 35:51.882
or you will die
in less than 60 seconds.

35:51.883 --> 35:54.383
What?

35:57.889 --> 36:00.389
Freeze!

36:04.395 --> 36:05.695
Your wife, Elsa.

36:05.696 --> 36:08.859
She works
for Russian Intelligence.

36:10.268 --> 36:12.768
I know.

36:13.371 --> 36:17.239
Six years ago,
the NSA recruited me.

36:17.308 --> 36:19.042
They told me I was a target.

36:19.043 --> 36:21.543
They had intel that
I was gonna be approached.

36:27.485 --> 36:28.718
You're NSA?

36:28.719 --> 36:31.219
They recruited me
out of Caltech,

36:31.222 --> 36:32.489
even though, if you ask them,

36:32.490 --> 36:34.990
they'll deny
any affiliation with me.

36:34.992 --> 36:37.260
I knew Elsa was a spy
the day we met.

36:37.261 --> 36:39.396
Your wife injected you
with a cyanide caplet.

36:39.397 --> 36:40.730
We have to remove it now!

36:40.731 --> 36:41.932
- What?
- Listen to me.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.833
I came this far because of this.

36:43.834 --> 36:46.530
- She wouldn't try and kill me.
- She didn't. Her handlers did.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.292
When did she implant this thing?

37:09.293 --> 37:10.727
Right after you met.

37:10.728 --> 37:12.596
You have less than 30 seconds
before you die.

37:12.597 --> 37:15.065
We have to remove this
right now.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.334
Give me your left wrist.

37:17.335 --> 37:18.835
Okay, look away.

37:18.836 --> 37:21.336
No. I'm okay.

37:24.208 --> 37:26.708
Aah!

37:27.211 --> 37:29.479
- Oh, God. Come on.
- Hang on.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.513
Hang on.

37:30.514 --> 37:31.881
Aah!

37:31.882 --> 37:34.382
God! Aah!

37:44.161 --> 37:46.661
Thanks.

38:07.685 --> 38:11.280
No matter what
you may think of me,

38:11.355 --> 38:14.290
I would have done anything
to bring you home.

38:15.359 --> 38:17.859
I know.

38:19.363 --> 38:22.230
We both have a lot
to figure out.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.667
I don't think either of us

38:23.668 --> 38:26.831
are in a position
to pass any judgments.

38:38.249 --> 38:40.483
I love you.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.984
I love you, too.

38:51.696 --> 38:56.065
I know I'm not in a position
to ask you for any favors.

38:56.133 --> 38:58.268
But whatever
you plan on doing to me,

38:58.269 --> 39:00.737
just please leave Vaughn
out of it.

39:00.738 --> 39:02.972
Vaughn will be escorting
the Caplans

39:02.973 --> 39:04.541
to Bainbridge Island.

39:04.542 --> 39:07.042
I've granted Elsa
defector status.

39:07.111 --> 39:09.841
She is not Irina Derevko.

39:11.182 --> 39:15.175
We downloaded the DNA database
Caplan decrypted

39:15.252 --> 39:18.688
from the computer
he was working on.

39:18.756 --> 39:21.953
We finally have a lead
on Sloane and Derevko.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.027
Good.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.428
Sydney,
if you go around me again,

39:25.429 --> 39:27.330
I'll have you transferred.

39:27.331 --> 39:31.563
And finding them will no longer
be part of your job description.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.678
I owe you an apology.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.413
You don't have to explain.

39:43.414 --> 39:44.614
Oh, no.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.516
Let me say this.

39:46.517 --> 39:48.818
When Marcus first told me
about SD-6,

39:48.819 --> 39:50.954
I felt so betrayed.

39:50.955 --> 39:53.719
In part, I blamed you for that.

39:56.994 --> 40:00.657
Your world has these rules
that force good people to lie,

40:00.731 --> 40:03.231
even to those
they're closest to.

40:05.803 --> 40:08.795
Before I could accept that,

40:08.873 --> 40:11.373
I had to understand it.

40:12.076 --> 40:15.637
I rescinded the transfer order.

40:15.713 --> 40:19.649
Diane rescinded the order.

40:22.186 --> 40:24.686
Uh, Mr. Bristow.
Mr. Bristow.

40:24.688 --> 40:25.855
Yes, Marshall?

40:25.856 --> 40:28.825
I was doing some spelunking
on the CIA network.

40:28.893 --> 40:30.093
Mapping it, really.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.094
You can relax,

40:31.095 --> 40:34.553
because the Death-Star plans
are not in the main computer.

40:34.632 --> 40:37.601
Anyway, I did find
a bandwidth discrepancy.

40:37.668 --> 40:40.432
I thought it was a Trojan virus
implanted on the system,

40:40.538 --> 40:43.038
but unless it was locked
into a renaming RAM cache...

40:43.140 --> 40:44.908
Marshall!

40:44.909 --> 40:46.810
Please, English.

40:46.811 --> 40:49.078
I found a massive
information hemorrhage.

40:49.079 --> 40:51.673
Someone without authorization
accessed the system

40:51.749 --> 40:54.775
and downloaded 10 gigabytes of
satellite footage from Tuscany.

40:54.852 --> 40:56.152
- Tuscany?
- Yeah.

40:56.153 --> 40:57.987
How did they hack in?

40:57.988 --> 41:00.488
They didn't.
It came from this office.

41:01.425 --> 41:04.189
No, there's no way the agency

41:04.261 --> 41:05.795
has season tickets
for the Lakers.

41:05.796 --> 41:08.890
I'm telling you.
4 seats, 12 rows back.

41:08.966 --> 41:12.561
By this point, I don't know
why I'm surprised, but I am.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.404
I'll see you
after I get the kids.

41:14.405 --> 41:15.905
- Mm-hmm.
- Good night.

41:15.906 --> 41:17.140
Good night, Diane.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.641
Good night.
- Good night.

41:20.177 --> 41:22.512
Feels good...

41:22.513 --> 41:25.013
having it out in the open.

41:25.983 --> 41:28.483
See you tomorrow.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.490
Oh!
By the way...

41:45.336 --> 41:48.169
Diane! Oh, God!

41:50.474 --> 41:54.103
Stay back.
Step back now.
