00:21.400 --> 00:23.960
- Sweetie.
- Angela, I don't want to.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.031
Sweetie, could you stop galloping?

00:26.120 --> 00:29.351
Better able to withstand
pressure when you can't catch me.

00:29.440 --> 00:30.793
Call it a favour.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.633
How is me going to a company
Christmas party a favour?

00:33.720 --> 00:36.280
- Remember what happened last year?
- I didn't go.

00:36.360 --> 00:39.636
Exactly. It took me weeks to
collect all those photocopies.

00:39.720 --> 00:43.952
I need you. Friends don't let friends
photocopy their butts at company parties.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.918
- There's a secret Santa.
- I don't like secret Santa.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.391
The idea that we are forced by convention
to exchange meaningless gifts...

00:51.480 --> 00:55.519
Yeah. If you rearrange "secret
Santa", though, you get "secret Satan".

00:55.600 --> 01:00.196
- What possible meaning could that have?
- I've already had an eggnog, if you can't tell.

01:00.280 --> 01:04.956
How am I gonna enjoy this party knowing that
my best friend in the world is in the lab,

01:05.040 --> 01:07.679
eyeball to eyeball with Skeletor?

01:07.760 --> 01:11.070
- Who?
- He's a cartoon villain who looks like...

01:11.160 --> 01:15.790
You know, his name is self-explanatory.
Would you please just come to this party?

01:15.880 --> 01:16.869
Phew.

01:16.960 --> 01:20.669
- 20 minutes.
- Bones. All right.

01:20.760 --> 01:24.275
- Merry Christmas, Seeley.
- Oh, wow. Oof!

01:24.360 --> 01:26.351
- What are you? An elf?
- Yes.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.908
What's wrong with a
little Christmas spirit?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.992
- What's the context?
- A property on Dupont Circle,

01:32.080 --> 01:35.959
where Congress puts up agriculturaI
specialists, or something.

01:36.040 --> 01:41.034
They're digging to put in a solarium and they
find a fallout shelter with a skeleton inside.

01:41.120 --> 01:45.033
- How long was it in there? - It was
built in the '50s. That A-bomb panic.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.749
- It's not a suicide. - Why? Hole
in the head, the gun - suicide.

01:48.840 --> 01:52.674
He shoots himself in the head and
somehow his arm ends up across his chest?

01:52.760 --> 01:55.399
Bring the skeleton. I'll
prove it wasn't suicide.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.675
<i>Merry Christmas, Bones.</i>

01:57.760 --> 02:02.436
- Come on, boys, bring it in.
- Oh, no. We're going to the company party.

02:02.520 --> 02:06.229
Go ahead. I'll do a cursory examination
and meet you in a few minutes.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.277
All right. There you go. Wow.

02:09.360 --> 02:14.434
Booth, will you escort Angela to the party
and make sure she doesn't photocopy her butt?

02:14.520 --> 02:18.957
No, I can't do that. I got some last-minute
Christmas shopping that I gotta do.

02:19.040 --> 02:23.591
- It's not last-minute untiI tomorrow.
- Come on, Bones. Bones. I gotta...

02:23.680 --> 02:25.636
- Come on.
- Jeez.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.237
<i>Stop.</i>

02:30.160 --> 02:31.957
Stop!

02:36.000 --> 02:38.150
Turn.

02:38.240 --> 02:42.916
Your robot reminds me of you. You tell it to
turn, it stops. You tell it to stop, it turns.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.231
<i>You ask it to take out garbage,
it watches reruns of Firefly.</i>

02:46.320 --> 02:51.269
After I fix the voice recognition protocols,
this is going to blow those gomers at MIT away.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.716
We've got about half a
litre of pure alcohoI here.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.429
Dump it in the eggnog, we've got
the best Christmas party in history.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.308
- I brought eggnog.
- I can't drink while I work.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.676
- Good thing I didn't bring it for you.
- CrystaI is after you.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.354
Like Alien after Predator.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.237
Sit!

03:34.280 --> 03:37.829
- What have you got there?
- Two open tickets to Paris.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.196
One-way. Pan Transit Airlines.

03:41.280 --> 03:44.238
- They're blank.
- Pan Transit went bust in the '60s.

03:44.320 --> 03:48.438
- I thought you were at the party.
- It's not a party, it's a Star Wars convention.

03:48.520 --> 03:52.593
<i>This was still in the skull.</i>

03:52.680 --> 03:55.877
.22 calibre, matches the gun.
Did you open up the suitcase?

03:55.960 --> 03:57.075
- Nope.
- Why not?

03:57.160 --> 03:59.674
Its contents could
compromise my objectivity.

03:59.760 --> 04:03.799
- Yeah, like a name and address?
- I prefer unbiased initiaI observations.

04:03.880 --> 04:07.429
- Is that pure alcohoI?
- Yes, Dr Brennan.

04:07.520 --> 04:11.832
You think Goodman will let you spike the
eggnog after the Fourth of July fiasco?

04:11.920 --> 04:14.753
- We may have to rethink.
- Zack, clean these bones.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.831
- Now?
- Ha! Burnt.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.992
<i>And I need you to search the
clothing for insect evidence.</i>

04:20.079 --> 04:22.469
Jeez, Bones, merry Christmas.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.869
<i>OK. You people listen to me.</i>

04:24.960 --> 04:28.839
There is a party going on
upstairs, OK? A Christmas party.

04:28.920 --> 04:34.278
We're going up there. We're gonna talk to
some people, sing some carols, drink eggnog.

04:34.360 --> 04:38.239
You are going to kiss me under
the mistletoe. On the lips.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.551
I might kiss you guys
under the mistletoe too.

04:41.640 --> 04:45.030
Maybe even you. In a
festive, nonlesbian manner.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.634
But we are going to that party.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.911
- Put on a mask. I'm taking core samples.
- OK.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.068
- What's that?
- BiologicaI contamination.

05:30.640 --> 05:31.959
<i>Zack!</i>

05:33.360 --> 05:34.952
Whoa!

05:35.040 --> 05:39.238
- The doors seaI automatically. Don't worry.
- What do you mean, don't worry?

05:39.320 --> 05:41.550
Don't panic untiI we know what it is.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.631
- What what is?
- We might know.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.349
I cut into the fallout shelter bones
and the biohazard alarm went off.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.477
- Were you conforming to autopsy protocoI?
- One of us was.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.994
The other was drinking an eggnog.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.231
And you didn't have your mask on? Oh!

06:03.800 --> 06:07.315
<i>- The pathogen is coccidioidomycosis.
- Valley fever?</i>

06:07.400 --> 06:11.871
<i>It was picked up in the scanner in the
discharge vent at Mr Addy's station.</i>

06:11.960 --> 06:15.316
- What's valley fever?
- A fungus that can lead to pneumonia,

06:15.400 --> 06:17.709
spontaneous abortion. Death.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.952
The alarm sounded after Mr Addy cut
into a human bone. That was the source.

06:22.040 --> 06:26.158
<i>- Was he following autopsy protocol?
- Of course. However...</i>

06:26.240 --> 06:28.913
I was drinking an eggnog.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.309
<i>And he's with you,
breathing the same air.</i>

06:31.400 --> 06:35.871
I got into the decontamination shower with
Zack. Haven't I been through enough hell?

06:35.960 --> 06:38.918
<i>- Is he contagious?
- He may have inhaled the spores, yes.</i>

06:39.000 --> 06:44.393
OK. It must suck to be Hodgins, but the rest of
us didn't inhale. So it's OK that I go, right?

06:44.480 --> 06:47.358
Dr Hodgins may have exhaled
the spores all over us.

06:47.440 --> 06:52.514
<i>We must impose quarantine. Valley fever
can be fatal, and we can't risk a pandemic.</i>

06:52.600 --> 06:55.558
<i>Just calm down and let us
handle things from this side.</i>

06:55.640 --> 06:59.872
Anyone besides me worried that a
guy dressed like Santa is in charge?

06:59.960 --> 07:01.598
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

07:01.680 --> 07:04.592
You know what? If this is
fataI, I will shoot both of you.

07:05.040 --> 07:07.190
Maybe you guys could go get dressed.

07:48.640 --> 07:53.475
I zapped the bones with ultraviolet light and
put them on the isolation table, so no spores.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.313
I found this sewn into
the lining of his clothing.

07:56.400 --> 08:01.076
- A woman's wedding band.
- Two tickets to Paris, a picture forms.

08:01.160 --> 08:04.311
Don't form pictures. Accumulate
evidence. DentaI work?

08:04.400 --> 08:07.836
Acrylic resins in the interior
fillings from the 1940s.

08:07.920 --> 08:13.711
Childhood tibia break. Bad enough that he
walked with a limp. Also, he wore a toupee.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.270
- It hasn't degraded.
- It's made of a synthetic called DyneI.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.954
It couldn't have looked good.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.874
This is a cocktaiI of four antifungaI
drugs, including amphotericin B.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.669
You'll be taking ketoconazole,
fluconazole and itraconazole.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.318
Then we can leave?

08:29.400 --> 08:32.756
We won't know for a couple of days
if the fungus took hold in you.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.957
Whoa! You're saying that we're
stuck here over Christmas?

08:36.039 --> 08:40.318
Look, you know, I have... places to go.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.833
- I have obligations.
- We all have.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.673
- I'm supposed to go to Quebec.
- Whose fault is this?

08:45.760 --> 08:48.558
Who forced me to go to the
party where I drank too much?

08:48.640 --> 08:51.996
Who never should have cut a bone
with a drunken fooI in the room?

08:52.080 --> 08:55.993
- Who brought us human remains?
- You're saying that this is my fault?

08:56.080 --> 09:00.676
- You knew Dr Brennan could not resist.
- I could have resisted had I been in Niger.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.991
- You're blaming me.
- We'll have sleeping bags delivered.

09:04.080 --> 09:08.756
Have your loved ones call me and we'll set
up a safe quarantine visit on Christmas Eve.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.956
Oh, and be prepared for side effects.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.190
Nausea, fever, insomnia?

09:13.280 --> 09:16.511
In rare cases euphoria, dream
state, mild hallucinations.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.953
I'll take that.

09:18.040 --> 09:21.112
- Early symptoms mimic a cold.
- What if it manifests?

09:21.200 --> 09:24.875
Treatment involves painfuI
injections into the base of the brain.

09:24.960 --> 09:31.433
You know what? I never realised
how pretty all this shiny stuff is.

09:31.520 --> 09:34.751
That is so not fair.

09:41.520 --> 09:46.435
Tomorrow I was leaving for Quebec. You
wanna know the true meaning of Christmas?

09:46.520 --> 09:51.753
It's being inside a 300-year-old inn with a
masseuse when there's 10ft of snow outside.

09:51.840 --> 09:56.391
Christmas is going home to Michigan and
cutting a Christmas tree with your brothers,

09:56.480 --> 10:00.314
and you all decorate it together
- brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.914
40 people who love you
and are happy to see you.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.039
That, my friend, is the
true meaning of Christmas.

10:09.200 --> 10:13.432
Nah, I'm gonna have to go
with the masseuse on this one.

10:13.520 --> 10:17.957
What are those little tiny
lights dancing on the ceiling?

10:18.960 --> 10:23.715
For the third time, those are minute
firings of neurons on your optic nerve

10:23.800 --> 10:26.314
due to a reaction to
the antifungaI cocktaiI.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.550
<i>Wow!</i>

10:28.640 --> 10:31.108
They're beautifuI.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.158
You are stoned, Agent Booth.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.837
Oh, good.

10:36.920 --> 10:41.948
Let's hope it lasts long enough to keep this
from being the worst Christmas of my life.

10:42.040 --> 10:45.350
What are you complaining
about? I don't like to boast,

10:45.440 --> 10:48.398
but I am the spirit of
Christmas in my house.

10:48.480 --> 10:53.190
I have a wife and twin
5-year-old daughters.

10:53.280 --> 10:57.512
We have family traditions. The most
important is being together for Christmas.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.068
Wow. They're beautifuI.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.955
You know...

11:04.040 --> 11:06.838
I have a kid too.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.596
His name's Parker.

11:09.680 --> 11:15.630
He's four years old. His mother wouldn't
marry me so my parentaI rights are totally f...

11:15.720 --> 11:19.759
- Vague?
- That's Christmassier than what I thought.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.071
- He's a fine-looking boy. - I
get him part of Christmas Day.

11:23.160 --> 11:29.554
I get him an excellent present every year,
something really cooI. But this year...

11:29.640 --> 11:32.518
Yes. This year...

11:33.400 --> 11:37.279
What are those little
lights on the ceiling again?

11:37.360 --> 11:40.432
I know it's against your
nature, but I need your help.

11:40.520 --> 11:43.557
- For what?
- To make Christmas.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.631
Why? Because we're the girls?

11:45.720 --> 11:50.555
Yes. We have to decorate and we
have to make our own secret Santa.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.074
You called it "secret Satan" before.

11:54.080 --> 11:59.313
It's all so tragic. The cheap wedding ring
sewn into his suit. Two tickets to Paris.

11:59.400 --> 12:03.837
It makes you wonder, who was the girI?
Can you imagine what it was like for her?

12:03.920 --> 12:07.799
Waiting and wondering,
never knowing what happened.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.475
- I don't have to imagine.
- What do you mean?

12:12.600 --> 12:16.149
- I tell you what I'm gonna do for Christmas.
- Good. Thank you.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.993
At last you decide to take part.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.230
I'm gonna solve a murder.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.837
Bones, it's after midnight. Hm?

12:37.920 --> 12:42.596
Christmas Eve day. Both an eve and
a day, it's a Christmas miracle.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.638
Still enjoying your medication, I see.

12:49.200 --> 12:53.034
OK. So, what are we looking at?

12:53.120 --> 12:56.999
There are traces of lead and nickeI
on the guy's osteologicaI profile.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.116
You don't seem upset to miss Christmas.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.556
Indications are that Christ, if
he existed, was born in spring,

13:02.640 --> 13:06.269
and the celebration of his birth
was shifted to the winter solstice

13:06.360 --> 13:08.669
so early Christians weren't persecuted.

13:08.760 --> 13:12.389
- Hm. Who are you? The Christmas killer?
- It's the truth.

13:12.480 --> 13:16.268
It sounds like the truth
cos it's so rationaI, right?

13:16.360 --> 13:20.273
But, you know, the true truth
is that you hate Christmas

13:20.360 --> 13:24.239
so you just spout out all these facts
and you ruin it for everyone else.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.117
I ruin the true truth with facts?

13:26.200 --> 13:29.476
You ruined it for the squint
squad by making them work on a case

13:29.560 --> 13:33.348
about a guy who's been sealed up
in a fallout shelter for 50 years.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.317
How should I spend my Christmas?

13:35.400 --> 13:41.953
Christmas is the perfect time to
re-examine your standing with... you know.

13:43.080 --> 13:46.197
- A helicopter pilot?
- Oh, right, right.

13:46.280 --> 13:50.512
You can't measure the man upstairs in
a beaker so he can't possibly exist.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.989
- The man upstairs?
- Hm.

13:53.080 --> 13:57.471
You don't know if you're sick, but
you're willing to take drugs just in case.

13:57.560 --> 14:01.473
Seems to me you could give the man
upstairs the same benefit of the doubt

14:01.560 --> 14:03.790
that you do an invisible fungus.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.677
Hm.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.630
In some cases of valley fever
suppurating skin lesions appear.

14:20.720 --> 14:24.395
Could someone in responsibility
please order Zack to shut up?

14:24.480 --> 14:26.710
Coffee, coffee.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.076
- Good morning, Ms Montenegro.
- Where'd this come from?

14:30.160 --> 14:33.675
A hazmat team brought it over
this morning. Very appetising.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.638
- Are you back with us?
- Yeah, think so.

14:36.720 --> 14:40.554
Since we're stuck together for
Christmas, we should make the most of it.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.916
- How?
- Decorate, and exchange handmade gifts.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.434
- An excellent idea.
- I can get behind that.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.238
- I'm in.
- As am I.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.311
<i>- How about Bones?
- Hm...</i>

14:50.400 --> 14:52.789
What's the deaI with
Bones and Christmas?

14:52.880 --> 14:57.635
Last night I spun a little story about
two young lovers running off to Paris,

14:57.720 --> 15:00.792
but the man never shows up and
the woman is left wondering.

15:00.880 --> 15:04.031
And I say, "Imagine what
that must have been like. "

15:04.120 --> 15:06.998
And Brennan says, "I don't have to. "

15:07.080 --> 15:08.832
I still don't get it.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.673
- Oh, my God.
- What?

15:11.760 --> 15:15.230
Brennan's parents disappeared
just before Christmas. She was 15.

15:15.320 --> 15:19.393
- And she never knew what happened to them.
- Oh, God. That explains a lot.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.711
<i>- Yeah.
- We need a way to choose our secret Santas.</i>

15:22.800 --> 15:26.713
- I could build a random generator.
- Wouldn't it be better to match people?

15:26.800 --> 15:30.918
I got five numbers and five letters.
Tell me the number, I tell you the letter.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.709
- Are letters sequentiaI?
- SequentiaI. We'll go oldest to youngest.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.153
- Six.
- There's no six.

15:36.240 --> 15:39.277
<i>A through E and one through five.</i>

15:39.360 --> 15:42.909
Just pick a name and if you
get your own put it back in.

15:43.560 --> 15:46.028
- That could work.
- Good idea.

15:46.120 --> 15:49.157
Feds seized the house from
a man named GiI Atkins.

15:49.240 --> 15:52.391
Proceeds of crime from
fencing, dealing in jewels, art.

15:52.480 --> 15:57.873
Atkins built the fallout shelter in '51, sealed
it in '58, died in '83. What have you got?

15:57.960 --> 16:01.839
Nothing much speciaI about our
victim. You know about the toupee?

16:01.920 --> 16:05.833
Below average height, below average
weight. A little fraiI. Bad back.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.595
- He had a hunch, maybe from paperwork.
- So basically a wimp.

16:09.680 --> 16:13.434
- Contents of his pockets.
- Compass, penknife, some change.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.954
I got Goodman for this
secret Santa and...

16:16.040 --> 16:19.510
Anthropologically, gifts
assert dominance in a group.

16:19.600 --> 16:24.594
Imagine a holiday devoted to self-promotion,
especially in this materialistic culture.

16:24.680 --> 16:27.638
How can you expect me to
get behind that? How can you?

16:27.720 --> 16:31.713
Wow. That's deep. That's
a very deep pile of crap.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.833
You came to me with
information, a peace offering,

16:34.920 --> 16:40.677
but it was to make you feeI better, not
me. Proves my point. Any idea what this is?

16:40.760 --> 16:43.752
- No.
- Me neither. Try Dr Goodman.

16:43.840 --> 16:48.311
You know, Bones, you make it very,
very hard for me to be nice to you.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.917
We have to be extremely creative.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.117
A bunch of test tubes filled
with luminescent liquid.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.634
- Very festive.
- Probably give us cancer.

16:57.720 --> 17:02.032
- That would be fitting this Christmas.
- Tidings ofjoy, gentlemen. Joy.

17:02.120 --> 17:05.396
Decorations do not a Christmas
make, family and friends do.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.993
We're friends.

17:08.079 --> 17:12.232
- Or not friends. - We are
colleagues, friends, co-workers, yes,

17:12.319 --> 17:15.471
but for a father like
myself, like Agent Booth,

17:15.560 --> 17:18.393
test tubes don't make up
for missing the children.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.391
- Excuse me?
- Be kind, rewind.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.675
- Booth has a kid?
- Ah...

17:22.760 --> 17:25.718
Well, not common knowledge, I gather.

17:28.520 --> 17:31.796
I see you've decided to help
Dr Brennan with the case.

17:31.880 --> 17:36.078
Oh, you know, if Angela's
right, sure. Why not? I mean...

17:37.080 --> 17:40.390
A little something for Bones.
Call it Christmas spirit.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.916
My thoughts exactly. Um...

17:44.000 --> 17:47.390
I thought I might look at the
contents of the suitcase with you.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.232
Why?

17:49.320 --> 17:52.949
It beats making decorations
out of pipettes and cylinders.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.713
I mean, what makes you
qualified to look at clues?

17:55.800 --> 18:00.271
I'm an archaeologist. I'm good
with artefacts. Do you mind?

18:00.360 --> 18:03.830
No. Archaeologist. I thought
you were an administrator.

18:03.920 --> 18:07.799
I didn't start out that
way. He was fastidious.

18:07.880 --> 18:12.556
Everything neatly folded as
though by a trained valet.

18:12.640 --> 18:18.476
This man was by no means wealthy. All
the clothing is well-used and mended.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.597
Look, Blackman and Ball,
fine tailors, Washington, DC.

18:21.680 --> 18:25.309
The rest of his clothes are all
labelled from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.669
- Female handwriting.
- How'd you get that?

18:28.760 --> 18:31.320
After cuneiform, handwriting is a snap.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.597
- "Dearest LioneI."
- No envelopes, no return address.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.399
No signature either, just
this drawing of a leaf.

18:37.480 --> 18:43.919
They seem to be dated from the summer
of 1957 through to early winter of 1958.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.150
- With permission, I'll read these.
- Yeah.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.277
Bones thought you might
know what this is here.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.149
Oh.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.356
Hey, Rebecca.

18:56.440 --> 18:59.079
Thanks for calling.
You heard what happened?

18:59.160 --> 19:02.948
- It seems to be some kind of a pouch.
- You don't have to see me.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.235
Sid agreed to bring him by.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.392
Don't make me beg.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.751
Thank you.

19:15.840 --> 19:18.115
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.232
- Puparia show LioneI had valley fever.
- We knew that.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.959
Wow. Was that a shot?
Because I apologised.

19:30.040 --> 19:34.556
Goodman can't see his family. Zack can't
see his kids. Booth can't see his son.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.473
I'm an accidentaI grinch.
You're the Grinch on purpose.

19:37.560 --> 19:42.236
- I have no idea what you're saying to me.
- The Grinch is a creation of Dr Seuss.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.231
I got Angela for my secret Santa.

19:44.320 --> 19:48.029
What I want to do is blow up a
microscopic imagery of a toxic mould.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.908
She's interested in fractals. That
might appeaI to her. Do you agree?

19:52.000 --> 19:55.709
I'm not really who you want to talk
to about gifts. Booth has a kid?

19:55.800 --> 19:57.836
- You didn't know?
- No.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.593
I wasn't the one who told you.

20:00.680 --> 20:04.434
Fall 1958, heavyweight suit.

20:04.520 --> 20:09.150
Kinda small, wooI, black. First
name LioneI. That's all I got.

20:09.240 --> 20:13.028
Thanks. I appreciate it, it being
Christmas Eve and all. I'll hold.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.554
LioneI had a suit here made in town.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.757
The tailor's still exists.
His grandson owns it. Get this.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.798
They kept records. We may
find CarefuI LioneI's name.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.348
- CarefuI LioneI?
- Yeah. Little guy, toupee.

20:24.440 --> 20:28.991
Drank a vitamin tonic. Carried his own
compass. All his stuffjust so. CarefuI LioneI.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.311
- What was he worried about?
- Considering how he ended up...

20:32.400 --> 20:34.152
You have a son?

20:34.240 --> 20:36.276
- Yeah.
- You've never mentioned that.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.716
Nothing brings people together
like a Christmas lung fungus.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.360
Yes. That's great. When?

20:42.440 --> 20:44.590
Great. Thank you. Merry Christmas.

20:44.680 --> 20:49.151
LioneI Little. OK? He picked up
his new suit on November 7, 1958.

20:49.240 --> 20:52.789
He paid cash. He was supposed to
come back the next day for a shirt.

20:52.880 --> 20:57.556
But get this, he never showed
up. It was his wedding shirt.

20:57.640 --> 21:00.074
Whoa! Bless you.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.633
Uh-oh. Is that valley fever?

21:05.160 --> 21:07.720
Bones?

21:15.000 --> 21:19.676
So if LioneI was a coin collector, that
might explain the levels of lead and nickeI.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.593
When do they insert the
needle into your brain?

21:22.680 --> 21:26.514
I sneezed because the air is
dry. It's not valley fever.

21:26.600 --> 21:31.071
- Any other symptoms? Headache? - Any
fouI-smelling pustules on your shins?

21:31.160 --> 21:33.799
She sneezed twice.
Anything about the letters?

21:33.880 --> 21:37.668
Quite a lot, yes. They are very,
very passionate love letters.

21:37.760 --> 21:40.479
- CarefuI LioneI had a girlfriend.
- In trouble.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.996
- Pregnant in trouble?
- CarefuI LioneI wasn't so carefuI.

21:44.080 --> 21:47.072
Unmarried pregnant girI in
Oklahoma in the late '50s.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.515
LioneI came up here
to procure an abortion?

21:49.600 --> 21:52.034
This isn't a very
Christmas Eve-type story.

21:52.120 --> 21:56.238
Of course it is. The Christ myth is built
upon the travails of an unwed mother.

21:56.320 --> 22:00.950
OK, stop bringing up the Christ myth thing.
Some people believe it's more than a myth.

22:01.040 --> 22:04.794
- Who besides you?
- That'd be me. I'm a deacon at my church.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.916
I do. Christmas and Easter, anyway.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.869
Although I believe organised religion is
just another movement to controI the masses,

22:11.960 --> 22:14.872
it doesn't mean God doesn't love me.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.315
I'm a rationaI empiricist all the way.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.516
Unless you talk to my mother.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.875
Then I'm Lutheran.

22:21.960 --> 22:27.273
I can understand why you'd be sensitive,
Booth. You have a child out of wedlock.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.590
- Sweetie...
- What?

22:29.680 --> 22:30.999
<i>Um...</i>

22:31.080 --> 22:34.436
The letters display a combination
of both block and cursive.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.715
A combination of printing and writing?

22:36.800 --> 22:39.678
It would indicate she left
schooI in the second grade.

22:39.760 --> 22:43.639
Most white children then would attain
at least an eighth grade education.

22:43.720 --> 22:46.837
- She was African-American?
- I believe so, yes.

22:46.920 --> 22:50.833
- Was LioneI an African-American?
- No. He was definitely Caucasian.

22:50.920 --> 22:54.959
A white man and a pregnant
black girI in 1958 Oklahoma.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.110
- That was bad?
- It was illegaI.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.873
- In Oklahoma?
- Notjust Oklahoma, here in DC.

22:59.960 --> 23:02.349
- Then why come here?
- They were running away.

23:02.440 --> 23:06.797
LioneI had tickets to Paris. Where else
in 1958 could a white man and a black woman

23:06.880 --> 23:09.110
get married and live together?

23:09.200 --> 23:11.634
Visiting hours, folks. Who's first?

23:11.720 --> 23:14.598
As director of this
institution, I claim that right.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.238
OK, brief announcement.

23:16.320 --> 23:21.110
You guys might recognise my dad, but I don't
really wanna talk about it, so... thanks.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.760
OK? That's all.

25:41.920 --> 25:44.912
- You like it?
- It's very beautifuI.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.597
It's not done yet. We can put our
presents under there and we can...

25:50.680 --> 25:53.672
- You think it's stupid.
- No, Ange.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.275
What were your Christmas plans?

26:00.280 --> 26:06.594
My dad and I get together somewhere
quiet, exchange gifts, just the two of us.

26:06.680 --> 26:12.038
Since I was a kid, getting some time
alone with my dad was always difficult.

26:12.120 --> 26:15.317
So what is it with
you and gifts, anyway?

26:17.640 --> 26:22.031
I know your parents disappeared
just before Christmas.

26:25.720 --> 26:30.510
My brother Russ was... 19,
and we were still in the house.

26:31.360 --> 26:34.636
That must have been strange.

26:34.720 --> 26:40.431
Russ found our presents in my parents'
room, and Christmas Eve, when I was asleep,

26:40.520 --> 26:44.877
he snuck down and made Christmas,
trying to do the right thing for me.

26:44.960 --> 26:48.032
Christmas for his little sister.

26:50.240 --> 26:54.028
But when I came down and saw
the lights and the presents...

26:54.120 --> 26:59.672
- You thought your parents were back.
- I just expected to see them sitting there.

26:59.760 --> 27:03.036
Drinking their coffee, watching
Russ and me open presents.

27:03.120 --> 27:07.113
- Oh, my God.
- I kind of lost it.

27:07.640 --> 27:11.918
I refused to open the
presents untiI they came back.

27:13.680 --> 27:17.309
It was like I told Russ he
wasn't enough family for me.

27:17.400 --> 27:22.633
Before New Year's he went
out West to work and...

27:24.280 --> 27:26.748
I was in the foster system.

27:27.960 --> 27:31.555
Excuse me. We have LioneI's
missing persons file.

27:36.040 --> 27:41.068
The tree is really,
really beautifuI, Ange.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.593
Really.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.749
<i>LioneI Little was born May
19, 1934, Tulsa, Oklahoma.</i>

27:50.840 --> 27:53.274
<i>- Aged 24.
- Fits the remains.</i>

27:53.360 --> 27:56.830
<i>According to the report lodged
by his boss in January 1960,</i>

27:56.920 --> 28:01.755
LioneI Little worked as a lease inspector
for Silver Cloud Petroleum out of Tulsa.

28:01.840 --> 28:05.310
- An accountant.
- You were right about his coin collection.

28:05.400 --> 28:10.030
When LioneI vanished, so did most of his coin
collection. That was attached to the file.

28:10.120 --> 28:13.795
- Did the coins show up?
- Yeah. Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania.

28:13.880 --> 28:19.273
The sales were traced to GiI Atkins. He
made out about $8,000 selling those coins.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.920
Atkins killed LioneI
for a coin collection?

28:22.000 --> 28:26.312
$8,000 in 1958 translates
to roughly $64,000.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.119
CarefuI LioneI gets a
young black girI pregnant,

28:29.200 --> 28:33.955
he sells his coin collection so he can move
them to Paris and they can live together.

28:34.040 --> 28:39.512
He offers the coins to Atkins, who figures
it'd be easier to kill him and steaI the coins.

28:39.600 --> 28:45.835
Also, the last person to see LioneI was a
woman who cleaned his office. Ivy Gillespie.

28:45.920 --> 28:51.472
<i>- What's the significance of that?
- Does this look like an ivy leaf to you?</i>

28:51.560 --> 28:54.757
Ivy Gillespie. Race: negro.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.513
<i>- Oh, my God.
- You have to find her.</i>

28:58.880 --> 29:01.394
<i>- Ivy.
- She may not even be alive.</i>

29:01.480 --> 29:06.349
And if she is, this could be a reminder of
a painfuI time. What would we accomplish?

29:06.440 --> 29:11.036
You have to find the girI and tell
her what you know. Don't you see?

29:11.120 --> 29:14.510
- You can give her the answer you never got.
- Angela...

29:14.600 --> 29:18.718
I'm sorry, sweetie, but it's
true. You have a chance here.

29:18.800 --> 29:24.079
To say what? "Merry Christmas, Ivy. Your
fiancé was murdered and your life was ruined,

29:24.160 --> 29:26.833
but at least you get to
know what happened to him"?

29:26.920 --> 29:30.196
Don't you wish somebody
had said that to you?

29:33.800 --> 29:34.949
Yes.

29:46.880 --> 29:51.590
I realise it's Christmas Eve, but it's
extremely important that I find Ms Ivy Gillespie.

29:51.680 --> 29:55.878
We know that she was a cleaning
lady at Silver Cloud Petroleum

29:55.960 --> 29:59.350
in 1958 and 1959. After
that, we don't know.

29:59.440 --> 30:04.514
I wouldn't interrupt your Christmas except
this is very very important to a friend of mine.

30:04.600 --> 30:10.914
I don't wanna take time from your family, but
I have important news regarding a loved one.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.950
Do you have an address, or
place of work, or... anything?

30:17.040 --> 30:23.309
I've made dozens of calls in an effort to
track this woman down. It's that important.

30:25.200 --> 30:28.795
Assisted living? Is her
last name still Gillespie?

30:28.880 --> 30:32.873
Yes. Yes. Merry Christmas to you too.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.757
Hello?

30:34.840 --> 30:41.109
Yes. I was wondering if you could tell me
if you have any guests there, first name Ivy,

30:41.200 --> 30:45.478
born January 21, 1934.
She'd be African-American.

30:46.240 --> 30:51.030
Yes, I apologise. I should have
started with "Merry Christmas".

30:52.000 --> 30:56.755
Date of birth is January 21, 1934.

30:56.840 --> 31:02.073
She's African-American. Yes,
Ivy. Her name is still Gillespie.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.230
Yes, if her granddaughter's there.

31:04.680 --> 31:10.232
Yes, hello. I'm Dr Temperance Brennan
from the Jeffersonian Institution in DC.

31:10.320 --> 31:14.313
I have information that might be
very interesting to your grandmother.

31:14.400 --> 31:18.757
I can be reached through the
medico-legaI lab here at the Jeffersonian.

31:18.840 --> 31:21.718
And tell her "Merry Christmas".

31:24.520 --> 31:26.988
You found Ivy Gillespie.

31:28.040 --> 31:31.316
In an assisted living
facility near Bethesda.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.391
I spoke to her granddaughter.

31:33.480 --> 31:36.358
Thank you.

31:36.440 --> 31:38.795
She might not get in touch with us.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.838
She will.

31:41.920 --> 31:44.115
Because it's Christmas?

31:44.200 --> 31:45.553
Yes.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.994
- Did you find something?
- Two things that fit together.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.878
- Angela sent me. She says it's Christmas.
- OK.

32:10.960 --> 32:15.078
You still think there's more to learn
about LioneI Little and Ivy Gillespie?

32:15.160 --> 32:18.357
There's always more to learn. Hey.

32:19.320 --> 32:24.553
I'm sorry you didn't get Christmas
morning with your little boy.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.790
Thanks.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.873
Good. OK, everybody.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.428
Stand over here.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.511
Close your eyes.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.913
Open your eyes.

32:50.400 --> 32:55.394
<i>- Merry Christmas.
- Angela! Merry Christmas!</i>

33:20.920 --> 33:25.914
<i>- Look at all these gifts.
- We should be drinking eggnog.</i>

33:27.840 --> 33:31.992
Oh, my God! It's beautifuI. What is it?

33:32.080 --> 33:36.198
<i>- It's prettier if you don't know the details.
- That is beautifuI.</i>

33:36.280 --> 33:39.477
- Thank you.
- I wonder what it is.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.351
<i>- What did you get?
- Very impressive.</i>

33:44.920 --> 33:46.956
- You made this?
- Yeah.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.996
- Thank you.
- I'm next.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.555
It's from me.

33:52.640 --> 33:56.315
It's my family. And me.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.277
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.994
<i>- Scarabaeus sacer.
- A sacred scarab.</i>

34:04.080 --> 34:09.552
- That is excellently rendered, sir. Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

34:09.639 --> 34:10.914
Wow!

34:11.400 --> 34:12.992
Zack, that's, uh...

34:13.080 --> 34:16.356
<i>- Self-propelled
nonautonomic unit. - Well!</i>

34:16.440 --> 34:18.237
<i>It's a robot.</i>

34:18.320 --> 34:22.438
I thought if we get out of here in time
today, you could give it to your son.

34:22.520 --> 34:25.637
<i>- Merry Christmas.
- Ah, Zack.</i>

34:25.719 --> 34:28.632
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

34:37.920 --> 34:42.277
Bones, here's the thing. What if a gift
goes both ways? What's wrong with that?

34:42.360 --> 34:44.190
- Look at this.
- It's a penny.

34:44.280 --> 34:48.034
It's notjust a penny. It's
a 1943 bronze one cent piece.

34:48.120 --> 34:52.830
AII I'm saying is maybe the reaI gift is
when you accept something with a little grace.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.388
Over a billion pennies
were minted in 1943,

34:55.480 --> 34:58.631
most of them in steeI to
conserve copper for World War II.

34:58.720 --> 35:03.350
But a handfuI were struck in
an old-style bronze planchet.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.749
Only about 12 of them exist today.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.717
Whoa. Huh.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.473
- And this is one of 'em?
- Yes.

35:10.560 --> 35:11.993
Huh.

35:12.080 --> 35:15.834
- How much is it worth?
- Over $100,000.

35:16.840 --> 35:20.310
LioneI never showed GiI Atkins
the best part of his collection.

35:20.400 --> 35:24.996
Atkins murdered him, never knew
there was a fortune in his pocket.

35:25.080 --> 35:27.514
Looks like CarefuI
LioneI got the last laugh.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.636
Ready?

35:29.720 --> 35:31.597
It's time for our test results.

35:42.400 --> 35:48.077
Oh, green, green. Is that green as in "Go",
or green as "Stick a needle in your brain"?

35:52.400 --> 35:54.960
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.395
<i>Yes!</i>

35:58.160 --> 36:02.153
We are outta here. Merry
Christmas, everyone.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.714
Go. Go have Christmas.

36:07.440 --> 36:10.398
Wish your boy a merry Christmas from me.

36:10.480 --> 36:13.711
I'm at Wong Foo's if you
decide you want company.

36:18.080 --> 36:20.674
Merry Christmas, Bones.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.879
<i>Excuse me.</i>

36:43.280 --> 36:44.713
Hi.

36:44.800 --> 36:49.157
My name is Lisa Pearce, and this
is my grandmother, Ivy Gillespie.

36:49.240 --> 36:52.471
- Are you Dr Brennan?
- Yes.

36:52.560 --> 36:58.874
I gave birth to a half-white child
in Oklahoma, 1960. LioneI's daughter.

36:58.960 --> 37:02.270
Raised her myself. No education.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.870
I got her to college.

37:05.880 --> 37:10.271
- She died eight years ago.
- And Grandma raised me after that.

37:10.360 --> 37:13.989
Her mother was a nurse and
Lisa's gonna be a doctor.

37:14.080 --> 37:17.516
Grandma, I can't afford college.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.918
So LioneI was murdered?

37:22.000 --> 37:25.356
In 1959, yes, by a man named GiI Atkins.

37:25.440 --> 37:30.355
And you can figure that
out all this time later?

37:30.440 --> 37:32.431
He had these.

37:41.080 --> 37:43.230
Huh?

37:46.960 --> 37:49.952
Tickets to... Paris!

37:50.480 --> 37:54.268
Grandma, isn't that what he
promised you? A life in France?

37:54.360 --> 37:58.638
I thought the worst of him.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.118
Thank you, Dr Brennan.

38:07.200 --> 38:10.158
I have something even better.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.472
What could be better?

38:17.560 --> 38:20.677
You've given me back my life.

38:24.240 --> 38:26.276
It's a penny.

38:26.360 --> 38:30.638
There's something you ought
to know about that penny.

38:45.960 --> 38:48.315
- Drinks?
- Ah, yes.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.755
Christmas spirits come in many a guise.

38:50.840 --> 38:52.831
Cheers.

38:55.640 --> 39:01.112
Ivy Gillespie came to the lab after
you left, with her granddaughter.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.235
Mm-hm.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.390
Don't you wanna know what happened?

39:04.480 --> 39:06.471
I know what happened.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.472
You told her about CarefuI LioneI.

39:09.560 --> 39:13.109
You showed her the letters,

39:13.200 --> 39:16.829
the tickets, and she cried.
But you made her happy.

39:16.920 --> 39:21.630
Not to mention I gave her
a penny worth over $100,000.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.188
She won't care about that today.

39:24.280 --> 39:29.195
You just gave somebody the best
Christmas gift they could ever get.

39:30.360 --> 39:33.909
- Who's the secret Santa now?
- Stop.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.797
Whoa.

39:39.600 --> 39:45.755
And that weirdo assistant of yours just
made me the coolest dad in the world.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.718
Daddy! Daddy!

39:51.000 --> 39:53.389
- Hey, look. Look at this thing.
- Can it flip?

39:53.480 --> 39:57.712
How cooI. It can flip, trip,
swim, whatever you want.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.234
- Say "Merry Christmas".
- Merry Christmas.

40:06.120 --> 40:08.156
OK, big guy.

42:04.200 --> 42:08.955
