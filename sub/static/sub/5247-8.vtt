The Red Road,
your debt is dear.

16:12.246 --> 16:13.913
Blood must be given.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.771
The Yellow Road,
a gift returned.

16:21.164 --> 16:23.099
Fortune shines upon you.

16:29.548 --> 16:33.886
The Black Road,
your soul is burned.

16:38.214 --> 16:41.242
I trust that
is self-explanatory.

16:41.274 --> 16:42.908
What's the Brown Road?

16:43.189 --> 16:44.713
Hershey Highway?

17:45.339 --> 17:49.075
- Look at that. Easy peasy.
- Too easy.

17:49.167 --> 17:52.389
[Sonja] Freight elevator. That's
gotta be the way down there.

18:00.605 --> 18:01.854
Shit!

18:04.066 --> 18:07.724
Yo! [whistles] Hey!
I need you to check my list.

18:07.749 --> 18:08.851
_

18:08.886 --> 18:10.779
No, no, no!
I need you to do it, okay?

18:11.253 --> 18:13.174
Buddy, I got four deliveries today, okay?

18:13.250 --> 18:16.069
I don't have time. Ten seconds,
all right? Come on.

18:42.263 --> 18:45.481
Okay, now, the trick to gun cleaning
is you gotta use a lot of...

18:45.533 --> 18:46.859
[gun cocks]

18:47.351 --> 18:48.818
Son of a bitch.

18:53.552 --> 18:56.359
Hands where I can see em.
You, too, sweetheart.

18:56.685 --> 18:59.607
- Who's this asshole?
- [Seth] The thorn in our side.

19:01.499 --> 19:03.306
- I just wanna talk.
- Shoot him, Richard.

19:03.331 --> 19:05.714
- I want in on Jacknife Jed's.
- You know about that?

19:05.739 --> 19:08.539
How the fuck did you find us? 
-I knew about your uncle from your file.

19:08.833 --> 19:09.739
Been following you guys

19:09.764 --> 19:12.365
- since you buried him yesterday.
- You want in on Jacknife's?

19:12.977 --> 19:15.511
Just drive on over
and get what you need.

19:15.563 --> 19:18.963
They've got sodas,
beers, gummy worms.

19:19.233 --> 19:21.400
You know, kinda like Benny's,
but, you know, uh,

19:21.435 --> 19:23.506
no dead father figures
lyin' on the floor.

19:23.531 --> 19:26.176
Send them boys to hell, Frederico.

19:26.799 --> 19:30.971
Look, you guys wanna take out
Malvado, rob him blind, go ahead.

19:31.119 --> 19:32.815
It's only gonna help me
do what I gotta do.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.371
- Which is what?
- He's got something

19:34.396 --> 19:36.109
that's gonna put us all
in a world of trouble.

19:36.426 --> 19:39.284
- I gotta get it back.
- No dice, homeslice.

19:39.336 --> 19:41.370
- [Seth] Shoot him, Richard.
- Okay, look. Listen.

19:41.422 --> 19:43.338
I don't care how much
you cased that truck stop,

19:43.374 --> 19:45.394
I'm willing to bet you don't
know what's underneath.

19:48.757 --> 19:50.447
- I got a map.
- Bullshit.

19:50.472 --> 19:52.178
I got it from Malvado's brother.

19:53.274 --> 19:55.258
Kill me, you're lost down there.

19:55.454 --> 19:58.625
Take me with you,
we all get what we want.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.123
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Easy, dude.
Be careful with that.

20:46.328 --> 20:49.380
Anybody's gonna answer for this
stuff, it's gonna be me. Okay?

20:49.415 --> 20:52.380
Why don't you just let my
guys handle the merchandise.

20:53.169 --> 20:56.053
Do they Botox your face,
or are you always this cheerful?

20:57.030 --> 20:59.069
[banging]

20:59.226 --> 21:00.546
Okay, man, go ahead.

21:00.571 --> 21:03.181
If your boss likes his Wagyu
untouched by human hands,

21:03.206 --> 21:06.207
just stay away from this crate, all right?
It's prime cuts.

21:09.488 --> 21:11.086
Yo! What did I just say?

21:13.285 --> 21:14.448
[sighs]

21:14.808 --> 21:16.267
I told you.

21:16.292 --> 21:18.798
Now, let's get these down below, okay?

21:31.025 --> 21:34.047
You got ten minutes to unload 
all your stuff. Hurry up.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.355
Jackpot.

22:05.481 --> 22:07.848
<i>♪ I like to have gone insane ♪</i>

22:31.651 --> 22:34.735
In some cultures, they
cut the head off the messenger

22:34.737 --> 22:36.348
who brought the bad news.

22:37.768 --> 22:39.274
Well, I saved you
the trouble.

22:39.440 --> 22:42.159
[Malvado] You killed Narciso
and destroyed the Twister.

22:42.211 --> 22:44.962
I can only assume
you've come to repent.

22:50.586 --> 22:51.773
What's this?

22:54.200 --> 22:57.875
I was gonna give a fuck, but
I'm all out of fucks to give.

22:58.635 --> 23:01.853
It's taken you 500 years
to make your move.

23:02.018 --> 23:04.157
What does that say about you?

23:04.350 --> 23:07.893
You came here in a wooden boat
with worms in your belly.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.600
I'm born of a god.

23:10.940 --> 23:12.690
But I got your attention,
don't I?

23:12.742 --> 23:14.491
And I'll have your face.

23:16.779 --> 23:18.785
You used <i> el rinche</i>
to get the key.

23:19.490 --> 23:23.375
I used <i> el rinche</i> to get the map.

23:27.649 --> 23:30.260
- You've read the stars.
- I found the well.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.475
Hand over the key.

23:32.628 --> 23:34.345
It's the only way
I release those souls.

23:34.388 --> 23:36.028
A thousand souls.

23:36.298 --> 23:39.528
Now, that's the only way
that you get into El Rey.

23:42.605 --> 23:45.993
Oh, yes,<i> jefe.</i>
I know your travel plans.

23:46.574 --> 23:49.026
You want to leave
this realm for good.

23:49.061 --> 23:53.815
Well, tick-tock,
tick-fucking-tock.

23:54.971 --> 23:57.901
You don't got much time, if you
want to fulfill the prophecy.

23:57.953 --> 24:00.168
I don't believe
in that nonsense.

24:00.193 --> 24:02.585
No, but someone has
to take over the empire.

24:03.325 --> 24:06.715
The gods won't let you leave the
table without someone at the head.

24:06.881 --> 24:08.472
You need a leader.

24:08.664 --> 24:11.110
And that's why you pitted me
against Narciso.

24:11.300 --> 24:15.039
And, well, I won.

24:18.699 --> 24:20.195
[Malvado] Who's this?

24:29.235 --> 24:30.652
And this one?

24:31.148 --> 24:32.812
Looks like a fighter.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.857
[Carlos]
Don't change the subject.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.660
You are the <i> pochteca.</i>

24:40.696 --> 24:42.576
Time to make a deal.

24:43.792 --> 24:45.423
Deals can be sweetened.

24:45.717 --> 24:46.936
[Carlos] It's simple.

24:47.412 --> 24:50.572
I give you what you need,
you give me what I want.

24:50.651 --> 24:53.652
- And what's that?
- Everything.

24:57.546 --> 25:00.095
I have outsmarted every Lord...

25:02.518 --> 25:03.784
...and you.

25:04.186 --> 25:07.304
I have earned this,
all of this,

25:07.356 --> 25:11.369
and when I have it,
there will be a new era...

25:11.560 --> 25:15.368
A new era unlike this world
has ever seen.

25:16.732 --> 25:19.366
[laughs]

25:19.807 --> 25:21.176
<i>Gallego!</i>

25:22.037 --> 25:26.290
Just when I thought it was impossible
for you to become a bigger asshole.

25:26.325 --> 25:29.705
Just give me the key,
or you won't see paradise.

25:32.998 --> 25:35.379
Sweeten the deal. Leave her.

25:41.051 --> 25:44.666
- She's yours.
- No! She's coming with us.

25:50.099 --> 25:52.917
- Where is it?
- The <i> chultún.</i>

25:54.236 --> 25:55.769
Three levels below.

26:06.282 --> 26:08.165
- Go, Scott.
- You kidding me?

26:08.200 --> 26:10.714
He needs that blood
just as much as you do.

26:11.370 --> 26:14.339
And if anything happens to me,
he's never gonna see any of it.

26:18.794 --> 26:21.175
Besides, it's not me
he wants, it's her.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.893
Yeah, but I can't
leave you with him.

26:24.622 --> 26:26.983
I paid a very high price

26:27.859 --> 26:29.644
to get you here, Scott.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.796
And I want you to go.

26:49.087 --> 26:53.144
It is customary for tribute of
flesh to tremble before the Lord.

26:53.295 --> 26:55.298
I'm not scared of you.

26:58.670 --> 27:00.459

27:04.139 --> 27:06.256

27:06.976 --> 27:09.364
- I don't dig mazes.
- Shhh...

27:26.445 --> 27:29.448
- We had the white stone.
- Look again.

27:45.431 --> 27:49.099
Did you really think you could
bring that stinking whore in here

27:49.134 --> 27:50.836
and we wouldn't smell it?

27:59.832 --> 28:01.286
[Seth] Put it right over there
on the right.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.397
Make sure you don't block the door.
When that opens, it'll screw us.

28:08.904 --> 28:10.904
[Seth] Take some of this shit
out and move it over, all right?

28:18.020 --> 28:19.364
She's here.

You're there.

Didn't I tell you
that you'd have everything?

28:32.594 --> 28:34.066
I didn't doubt it.

28:34.730 --> 28:38.315
- Does he know?
- He can never know.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.020
Yeah, this to the left.

28:42.846 --> 28:45.333
Yeah, all right, all right.

-Set that on back there.
- allright.

We're not going any further
without the proper tools.

- Something happened.

- What the hell? How?
- Fuck if I know.

29:19.464 --> 29:22.029
- We were extra careful with that one.
- Oh, yeah, I'll bet you were.

Okay, well, then
we should get outta here

- while we still can.
- We can't. I gotta fix this.

29:31.607 --> 29:34.980
You can't fix it,
because it was sabotaged by him.

We can disappear.

who profits?

This isn't my score, is it?

- Did you make a deal with someone?
- How could you even say that?

34:25.116 --> 34:28.847
You gave me a whole song and dance about
a rodeo clown and a robbery gone bad,

wasn't it?

35:42.037 --> 35:43.735
I don't even know who you are.

36:01.335 --> 36:03.001
Set me free.

36:07.174 --> 36:09.736
Set me free, Richard.

36:11.705 --> 36:13.538
<i>Set me free.</i>

36:14.417 --> 36:18.071
[Malvado as Santanico] <i> Help me, Richard.</i>
<i>Set me free.</i>

36:19.013 --> 36:21.759
Didn't she tell you not
to let me get in your head?

36:22.529 --> 36:25.438
[laughs]

36:29.889 --> 36:31.196
Shit.

36:33.460 --> 36:34.124
[grunts]

36:34.149 --> 36:36.483
Okay. You got a show to put on.

36:37.270 --> 36:38.442
[grunts softly]

36:38.467 --> 36:39.722
<i>Hace frío.</i>

36:39.747 --> 36:41.397
Yeah,<i> mucho frío.</i>

36:42.108 --> 36:44.108
A little bit
of a heater malfunction.

36:44.921 --> 36:46.705
Nothin' to worry about, okay?

36:47.022 --> 36:48.231
[banging]

36:49.042 --> 36:51.023
Shit! Come on.

37:14.307 --> 37:16.608
Oh, come on... Come on.

37:41.167 --> 37:42.178
[groans]

37:49.334 --> 37:51.009
Oh, Jesus.

38:02.098 --> 38:03.972
[grunts]

38:08.995 --> 38:11.824
Look at that. A hole in one.

38:12.923 --> 38:15.006
Somebody get me my <i> pistola.</i>

38:15.031 --> 38:16.731
[engine starts]

38:41.114 --> 38:42.582
Mwah!

38:43.536 --> 38:45.160
Buried alive.

38:45.333 --> 38:47.233
Rituals have rules.

38:54.591 --> 38:56.807
[Malvado] All this tribute
they bring me,

38:57.077 --> 38:58.994
they're sacrifices.

38:59.511 --> 39:02.718
But by seeing what someone
is willing to give up,

39:03.216 --> 39:05.750
you can learn a lot
about their true desire.

39:06.970 --> 39:09.575
I know what yours is.

39:11.931 --> 39:13.474
I know your brother's.

39:14.009 --> 39:15.510
I know Santanico's.

39:15.767 --> 39:20.398
She thinks her greatest desire
is to destroy me.

39:21.975 --> 39:24.692
- It's not.
- I'll let you tell her that. Me?

39:25.798 --> 39:27.462
I've known you
inside of two minutes,

39:27.487 --> 39:30.214
and my heart's desire
is for you to shut the hell up.

39:30.327 --> 39:31.833
Heart's desire.

39:32.946 --> 39:34.901
I love the irony in that.

39:36.415 --> 39:41.071
Yes, how we place so much weight
upon the organ of blood.

39:42.118 --> 39:44.183
My brother used to listen
to a radio show

39:44.460 --> 39:48.508
about a man who "knows what evil
lurks inside the hearts of men."

39:49.512 --> 39:51.629
That would always
make me laugh, because...

39:51.681 --> 39:54.465
- ...I know what lurks there as well.
- Yeah?

39:54.517 --> 39:56.351
It's that big snake brain.

39:56.386 --> 39:58.519
Gets you inside
everybody's head.

39:58.761 --> 40:02.519
Actions speak louder.
Take yours, for example.

40:03.226 --> 40:05.429
How you left Santanico
to her vengeance,

40:05.478 --> 40:07.407
but then you made
a deal with Greely,

40:07.814 --> 40:10.068
knowing that you'd need him
after all this was over.

40:10.093 --> 40:15.640
You see, Santanico wants to
destroy all of this, but not you.

40:16.956 --> 40:19.204
No, you want it to thrive.

40:25.051 --> 40:28.081
Be my guest. Try it.

40:28.501 --> 40:29.518
Go ahead.

40:34.007 --> 40:38.031
What do you think would happen
if Santanico were to kill me?

40:39.163 --> 40:41.905
You think there'd
be a throne left to sit on?

40:43.349 --> 40:48.069
You'd be fighting day and night with
<i> culebras</i> from Guadalajara to Tulsa.

40:48.104 --> 40:51.642
Men like Carlos... or worse.

40:52.192 --> 40:56.027
But if I were
to give it to you...

40:57.113 --> 40:59.158
a clean succession,

40:59.827 --> 41:01.488
there'd be no question.

41:07.613 --> 41:09.504
So you're just
gonna walk away?

41:10.260 --> 41:12.089
I may have no choice.

41:13.190 --> 41:16.248
If you believe in
the ancient word and all that.

41:16.729 --> 41:18.309
It's coming, Richard.

41:18.551 --> 41:20.274
"The dusk of one age..."

41:22.055 --> 41:23.666
"and the dawn of another."

41:24.695 --> 41:26.641
As in lights out for you.

41:26.976 --> 41:28.976
Not if I can pull
the switch first.

41:29.710 --> 41:31.918
No, I'm going
to a better place.

41:32.531 --> 41:34.135
I'm going to El Rey.

41:36.708 --> 41:40.428
It's a step up for me,
and, uh, it's a step up for you.

41:40.801 --> 41:45.293
- Treasures untold.
- I can get fat without you.

41:46.830 --> 41:48.246
Not quite like this.

41:50.214 --> 41:53.189
And you wouldn't have
your heart's desire.

41:54.156 --> 41:56.200
And we both know what that is.

41:58.091 --> 42:01.279
It's the reason you
robbed that bank in Abilene.

42:02.011 --> 42:04.645
And freed Santanico
from the Twister.

42:05.831 --> 42:09.676
It's the reason you wanted
to do this job by yourself.

42:09.936 --> 42:14.396
And the reason you drove
your old car off that cliff.

42:18.431 --> 42:21.496
- I had to throw off the cops.
- No, Richard.

42:21.531 --> 42:25.001
You despise the idea
of the Gecko Brothers.

42:25.351 --> 42:29.165
You want to be the only one.
You ought to be the only one.

42:29.982 --> 42:32.083
You still want to beat him.

42:32.709 --> 42:35.026
But don't you know
when you've already won?

42:37.297 --> 42:38.285
I know.

42:39.799 --> 42:42.987
He's blood,
but he suffocates you.

42:43.603 --> 42:47.092
You want to be rid of him.
You need to be rid of him.

42:47.741 --> 42:51.473
Remember, what a man
is willing to sacrifice

42:52.337 --> 42:55.168
tells us all we need to know

42:55.615 --> 42:57.924
about what he truly desires.

42:58.513 --> 42:59.915
And deserves.

43:01.420 --> 43:02.927
You want me to kill my brother.

43:03.802 --> 43:05.573
I don't care what you do.

43:07.043 --> 43:09.749
But a king rules
from his throne.

43:16.564 --> 43:18.295
[coughs]

43:29.585 --> 43:30.783
Richard...

43:31.023 --> 43:32.847
It's a new age, Richard.

43:34.237 --> 43:35.353
Yours.

43:36.606 --> 43:38.629
And all you have to do...

43:44.942 --> 43:46.618
...is claim it.

43:54.883 --> 43:56.359
What have you done?
