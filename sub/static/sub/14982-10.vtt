01:09.543 --> 01:11.243
Noah, what are
you doing?

01:12.546 --> 01:14.447
I was just looking
for George's garage keys.

01:14.514 --> 01:17.249
I was gonna go over there
to work on the bike.

01:18.652 --> 01:20.986
Oh, my God.

01:22.422 --> 01:25.157
How much do you think
this is, mom?

01:29.062 --> 01:32.298
It's none of our business.
Just put it back.

01:33.166 --> 01:35.034
Lily, I'm back!

01:38.739 --> 01:40.406
Noah, help me.

01:41.575 --> 01:44.477
Damn raccoons got into
the garbage again.

01:48.248 --> 01:50.449
4 7-minute miles.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.351
Well, almost.

01:52.419 --> 01:55.788
Averaged out to that, so I
rounded up a little bit.

01:55.856 --> 02:00.226
Either way, I am gonna
need one of your rubdowns.

02:00.293 --> 02:01.460
Oh.

02:02.763 --> 02:03.729
Hiya, Noah.
Sorry, man.

02:03.797 --> 02:05.798
I didn't know
you'd be in here.

02:05.866 --> 02:07.733
He was just lookin'
for your garage keys.

02:07.801 --> 02:09.769
Can't keep away
from the bike, huh?

02:09.836 --> 02:11.670
They're in the car.

02:11.738 --> 02:14.673
A quick rinse, and I'll
run you over there, huh?

02:28.855 --> 02:29.789
Damn raccoons.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.457
What are you gonna do?

02:47.641 --> 02:49.842
Uh, hey.
Are you ready?

02:49.910 --> 02:51.811
I seriously doubt it.

02:54.815 --> 02:56.348
Bloody hell.

02:57.250 --> 02:58.317
And your name is, again?

02:58.385 --> 03:00.069
Come on, dad.

03:00.153 --> 03:04.323
So all that for one night out on
the town with your mum in Chicago?

03:04.391 --> 03:07.526
Yes, at a very important
political fundraiser.

03:07.594 --> 03:08.861
No, that's what I said.

03:08.912 --> 03:11.230
So, seriously,
what do you think?

03:12.098 --> 03:13.165
It kinda looks...

03:13.233 --> 03:16.502
Like how your mum dresses.
You know what I mean?

03:16.570 --> 03:18.170
So you like it, then.

03:18.238 --> 03:21.774
Yeah. No, she always
had impeccable taste.

03:21.842 --> 03:23.275
Take me, for starters.
Ok.

03:23.343 --> 03:25.911
I got a present for her.
Hold on.

03:26.780 --> 03:29.381
Now, I wrapped this myself.

03:29.449 --> 03:30.850
Bollocks, you did.

03:30.917 --> 03:35.087
Oi! You save that kind of language
for the fundraiser, all right?

03:37.023 --> 03:37.957
Here.

03:38.024 --> 03:39.859
Whoa.

03:39.910 --> 03:41.126
What's--what is it?

03:42.128 --> 03:44.029
That's fragile,
is what it is.

03:44.097 --> 03:46.732
And that's a surprise.
She's gonna love that.

03:47.934 --> 03:50.803
So you don't like
my outfit. Be honest.

03:50.871 --> 03:52.738
I told you I liked it.

03:52.806 --> 03:55.174
So what time's your flight?

03:55.242 --> 03:56.675
We should probably
get where we're goin'.

03:56.743 --> 03:58.577
You know,
I'm part you, dad,

03:58.645 --> 04:00.246
but I'm also
part mom.

04:00.313 --> 04:03.849
Right. The rough
with the smooth.

04:03.917 --> 04:05.351
Tell me about it.

04:10.056 --> 04:12.224
You look beautiful, Em.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.327
Really...

04:15.395 --> 04:17.495
Top-notch.

04:17.564 --> 04:19.231
Come on.

04:37.050 --> 04:38.117
Excuse me, miss.

04:38.184 --> 04:41.720
Is this Stifflewitz,
Cookstein, and Johnsonberg?

04:41.788 --> 04:42.821
Come on, love.

04:42.889 --> 04:45.290
Uh, the law offices are
on the next floor up.

04:45.342 --> 04:47.459
This is the top floor,
darlin'.

04:47.527 --> 04:49.428
I mean
the floor below.

04:49.496 --> 04:50.562
You sure about that?

04:50.630 --> 04:51.563
Positive.

04:51.631 --> 04:52.965
Ah.

05:01.074 --> 05:02.174
Oi.

05:02.242 --> 05:05.244
The bald geezer,
that's Gandhi.

05:07.547 --> 05:10.249
Is this, like,
a photo studio or something?

05:10.317 --> 05:12.918
Uh, these are examples
of facial expressions.

05:12.986 --> 05:14.219
Fascinating,

05:14.287 --> 05:17.356
if you're into that sort
of thing, you know.

05:17.424 --> 05:19.091
That's what
they do here.

05:19.159 --> 05:20.092
What?

05:20.160 --> 05:21.093
Read faces.

05:21.161 --> 05:22.761
What for?

05:23.964 --> 05:26.632
Ask my mom.

05:29.169 --> 05:31.236
How 'bout
this one, then?

05:31.304 --> 05:32.938
He looks happy.

05:33.006 --> 05:33.939
That's Dick Cheney.

05:34.007 --> 05:36.008
I think he's angry,
not happy.

05:36.059 --> 05:38.844
You look a bit
like this one,

05:38.912 --> 05:41.313
minus the hookers.

05:43.383 --> 05:46.952
You're not really looking
for law offices, are you?

05:47.020 --> 05:48.721
You work here.

05:48.788 --> 05:51.890
If you're so good
at reading faces,

05:51.958 --> 05:54.626
what'd your mum
come to us for, then?

05:54.694 --> 05:56.795
Who are you?

05:58.231 --> 06:00.422
A-are you reading me?

06:33.800 --> 06:36.001
You love him,
but you don't trust him.

06:36.069 --> 06:37.803
Is that a fair assessment?

06:37.871 --> 06:39.455
I wish I had never found the money
or the notebook.

06:39.539 --> 06:40.539
You didn't.
Noah did.

06:40.607 --> 06:43.342
Lily Marber,
this is Cal Lightman.

06:44.411 --> 06:45.377
Hi.

06:45.445 --> 06:46.512
Oi, eh?

06:46.579 --> 06:48.881
I just had a little chat
with your son.

06:48.948 --> 06:50.249
He's a nice boy.

06:50.316 --> 06:51.750
He's smart.

06:51.818 --> 06:53.819
He'd rather pretend
this never happened.

06:53.887 --> 06:57.189
Well, Noah's become
very attached to George.

06:57.257 --> 07:00.726
You really believe he was looking
for George's garage keys, do you?

07:00.794 --> 07:04.530
Absolutely. He and George are
restoring an old motorcycle.

07:04.597 --> 07:06.665
Right.

07:12.906 --> 07:16.642
He's tryin' to protect his mum
from makin' a fool of herself.

07:16.709 --> 07:18.877
He said that?
I'm sayin' it.

07:20.747 --> 07:22.581
George Walker
is a good man.

07:22.649 --> 07:24.917
With a briefcase
full of cash.

07:24.984 --> 07:27.753
And a notebook full
of code in shorthand.

07:27.821 --> 07:29.188
He's a lobbyist.

07:29.255 --> 07:31.223
There could
be any number

07:31.291 --> 07:33.258
of explanations
for that.

07:37.864 --> 07:39.731
I'm gonna need
to put that back

07:39.799 --> 07:41.633
before he finds out
that it's missing.

07:41.701 --> 07:45.170
Not before we make
a copy, you don't.

07:45.238 --> 07:47.339
Does that mean you're gonna
look into George for me?

07:47.407 --> 07:50.175
No. It means I'm gonna look
into George for your son.

08:09.629 --> 08:11.029
Hey.

08:11.097 --> 08:14.299
Give me a hot dog
with extra everything

08:14.350 --> 08:16.668
and, uh, some napkins.

09:00.713 --> 09:02.347
Ah, you--oh, I'm--
what the--

09:02.415 --> 09:03.381
I am so sorry.

09:03.433 --> 09:05.350
Why don't you look
where you're goin', man?

09:05.401 --> 09:07.436
Oh, clumsy sod.
No, me, not you.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.605
- Let me just get that. I'll get that for you.
- No, look, I--

09:09.689 --> 09:11.023
please, please, I got it.
No, I got it!

09:11.090 --> 09:12.691
I got it.
Thank you. Ok?

09:12.759 --> 09:13.792
You made it worse.
Unbelievable.

09:13.860 --> 09:15.327
At least let me cough up
for the dry-cleaning.

09:15.395 --> 09:16.394
It was an acc--no,

09:16.446 --> 09:17.829
don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

09:17.897 --> 09:20.799
No, I insist.
Rude not to, really.

09:23.803 --> 09:24.736
Yeah, fine.

09:24.804 --> 09:27.539
Uh...

09:27.607 --> 09:29.641
Here. Thank you.
Thank you.

09:29.709 --> 09:31.143
Oh, so you're
a--a divorce attorney.

09:31.211 --> 09:32.444
That's a bit of luck.

09:32.512 --> 09:33.745
Look, I don't mean
to be rude,

09:33.813 --> 09:36.014
but I'm late for a meeting,
so if you'll excuse me...

09:36.082 --> 09:38.050
I understand.
So shall I, uh,

09:38.101 --> 09:39.885
call your secretary, arrange
everything through her?

09:39.936 --> 09:41.920
Him! My assistant!
Thank you!

09:41.988 --> 09:42.955
No, thank you.

09:43.022 --> 09:44.289
I don't know.

09:44.357 --> 09:46.308
There's just
something about him

09:46.392 --> 09:49.061
that doesn't look like your
typical inside-the-beltway type.

09:49.128 --> 09:50.295
That a scientific read?

09:50.363 --> 09:52.731
It's a gut read.

09:52.799 --> 09:53.899
Typical lobbyist.

09:53.967 --> 09:54.933
Silver tongue,

09:55.001 --> 09:56.401
charm on tap,

09:56.469 --> 09:57.502
expense account.

09:57.570 --> 09:58.737
Republican lobbyist.

09:58.805 --> 09:59.938
Not your type, then?

09:59.989 --> 10:02.741
I'm not saying
my arm couldn't be twisted.

10:02.792 --> 10:04.076
Twisted by who?
Whom.

10:04.143 --> 10:05.744
Does that count
as deflecting?

10:05.812 --> 10:08.213
George Walker is whom
could twist her arm.

10:08.281 --> 10:09.665
Who. George Walker
is who--

10:09.749 --> 10:11.617
never mind.
I wasn't being serious.

10:11.684 --> 10:12.884
No, just lustful.

10:12.952 --> 10:15.003
Can I help you with
something, Loker?

10:15.088 --> 10:17.306
Yes. You asked me
to dig up dirt on George,

10:17.390 --> 10:18.724
and I think
I struck gold.

10:18.791 --> 10:21.193
This reptile just
slipped George Walker

10:21.261 --> 10:22.928
an envelope
in the park.

10:22.996 --> 10:24.763
Well, what was in it?

10:24.831 --> 10:26.298
My best guess
would be more money.

10:26.366 --> 10:27.532
You know.
Well, do your worst.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.667
I'll be
in my office.

10:28.735 --> 10:30.902
No, there's someone
waiting in your office.

10:30.970 --> 10:31.903
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

10:31.971 --> 10:33.238
Well, this
should be good.

10:33.306 --> 10:36.108
Oh, no, no, she-- it is good,
but she's a little upset,

10:36.175 --> 10:38.076
and I thought she
could use some privacy.

10:38.144 --> 10:40.379
Well, what's the matter
with Torres' office?

10:40.446 --> 10:42.581
I brought her here
to see you.

10:42.649 --> 10:43.815
Oh, really?

10:54.627 --> 10:55.894
Thank you for coming.

10:55.962 --> 10:57.896
I got here
as soon as I could.

10:57.964 --> 11:00.098
The traffic lights
are out on Vermont.

11:00.166 --> 11:01.099
Wow.

11:01.167 --> 11:03.302
Oh.

11:03.369 --> 11:04.703
George just proposed.

11:04.771 --> 11:07.372
Which explains the cash
he was carrying.

11:09.709 --> 11:11.677
You think that's
just wishful thinking?

11:11.744 --> 11:15.113
Like you, Lily,
I really hope it's not.

11:25.124 --> 11:26.391
What's this all about?

11:26.459 --> 11:28.093
It's about Noah.

11:28.161 --> 11:30.162
I need you
to remember that.

11:30.229 --> 11:32.097
Come in.

11:33.466 --> 11:36.168
The future
Mrs. George Walker,

11:36.235 --> 11:38.870
meet the current
Mrs. George Walker.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.708
I was hoping for
a catfight over George,

11:46.776 --> 11:49.745
but you already know
about her, don't you?

11:50.713 --> 11:52.581
George told me
that he was waiting

11:52.649 --> 11:54.783
for his divorce papers
to come through.

11:56.219 --> 11:58.020
It's no secret to me.

11:58.087 --> 11:59.755
They say you have
a son caught

11:59.822 --> 12:01.290
in the middle
of all this.

12:01.357 --> 12:03.892
Paula, do you and
George have children?

12:03.943 --> 12:05.944
George has
zero interest in kids.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.196
Not interested
in having them,

12:08.264 --> 12:10.098
or not interested in
children in general?

12:10.166 --> 12:12.134
Both, as far as I know.

12:12.201 --> 12:13.652
Well--heh.

12:13.736 --> 12:15.804
He's got a kid now,

12:15.872 --> 12:17.306
a fully assembled one.

12:17.373 --> 12:19.708
And George
doesn't wear suits.

12:19.776 --> 12:22.444
He's a jeans and tool
belt man, a contractor.

12:22.512 --> 12:25.080
We must be talking about
2 different men here.

12:25.148 --> 12:26.682
I wish that were the truth.

12:29.118 --> 12:32.621
George and Paula have only
been married for 6 months.

12:34.624 --> 12:36.892
I just find it
hard to believe

12:36.960 --> 12:39.061
that someone can change
that quickly

12:39.128 --> 12:40.395
and this much.

12:42.298 --> 12:44.016
Please.

12:51.307 --> 12:53.742
Maybe he's changed.

12:53.809 --> 12:56.445
Maybe he'll change again

12:56.512 --> 12:58.547
in another 6 months.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.167
Dirty plugs?

13:25.708 --> 13:27.476
George isn't here.

13:31.414 --> 13:32.981
I'll have a go.

13:34.150 --> 13:37.252
We'll see if we can't get
this old hair-dryer

13:37.320 --> 13:39.388
up and running.

13:43.493 --> 13:46.878
So you don't trust George

13:46.963 --> 13:49.564
any more than
your mum does, do you?

13:49.632 --> 13:50.565
She loves him.

13:50.633 --> 13:52.567
Oh, she wants to, I think,

13:52.635 --> 13:54.886
and for her sake,
so do you.

13:54.971 --> 13:56.571
Nothin' wrong with that.

13:56.639 --> 13:59.558
But I'm here

13:59.642 --> 14:02.044
because she's decided
you come first.

14:02.979 --> 14:04.479
Hang on.

14:06.349 --> 14:07.749
Try that, then.

14:20.580 --> 14:22.531
Well, it was
worth a shot.

14:23.916 --> 14:28.103
Now, we both know you weren't
looking for George's keys,

14:28.171 --> 14:31.640
all right, so what else did you find
while you were playing Detective?

14:48.524 --> 14:50.776
Ding-dong.

14:53.262 --> 14:55.697
I found those
in his sock drawer.

14:55.765 --> 14:56.932
You know what?
Sod George.

14:56.999 --> 14:59.301
You know what I'd do
if I were you?

14:59.368 --> 15:01.169
I'd nick his bike.

15:02.338 --> 15:04.806
Subtitle--steal.

15:05.658 --> 15:08.577
Look, Noah,

15:08.644 --> 15:12.814
so what does this
expression say to you, eh?

15:13.916 --> 15:16.051
Noah, it's this simple.

15:16.118 --> 15:18.787
He's using the bike
to play your mum

15:18.855 --> 15:20.322
because he knows
you love it.

15:20.389 --> 15:22.924
Now, I'd say sorry,
but...

15:24.260 --> 15:26.528
I think you already
know that, huh?

15:30.133 --> 15:33.235
George still keeps
pictures of you.

15:35.972 --> 15:37.572
How did you find me?

15:37.640 --> 15:39.407
Our police contact
tracked you down

15:39.475 --> 15:42.010
through the license plate
in this photo.

15:42.879 --> 15:44.312
I was told
that George

15:44.380 --> 15:46.348
was in some kind
of trouble.

15:48.284 --> 15:50.018
How long were
you guys married?

15:50.086 --> 15:51.920
You know
the answer to that.

15:51.988 --> 15:54.356
6 months. You were
married only 6 months,

15:54.423 --> 15:55.991
and that's the part
that makes your blood boil.

15:56.058 --> 15:57.793
Do we have to talk
about this?

15:57.860 --> 15:58.927
Because
this is private.

15:58.994 --> 16:00.762
But you still love him.

16:02.832 --> 16:04.933
More like love-hate,
right, Ingrid?

16:05.001 --> 16:06.268
When I met George,

16:06.335 --> 16:09.104
I was going through
an ugly divorce...

16:10.673 --> 16:12.607
And he made me
feel wanted.

16:12.675 --> 16:14.609
What about money?

16:14.677 --> 16:16.912
He didn't marry--

16:19.282 --> 16:21.399
there was no mention
of money ever.

16:21.484 --> 16:23.852
You see how you're
breathing, Ingrid?

16:23.920 --> 16:26.388
Short breaths,
your heart is racing--

16:26.455 --> 16:29.074
that's the hate part.

16:31.861 --> 16:34.129
After he left me,
I found out

16:34.197 --> 16:37.232
that he was married
before me.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.835
You were his second wife?

16:41.370 --> 16:42.637
Third?

16:42.705 --> 16:44.372
Fourth?

16:45.241 --> 16:47.976
Fifth.

16:48.044 --> 16:50.812
I guess I must look
pretty dumb, huh?

16:50.880 --> 16:55.066
No. Really.

16:55.885 --> 16:57.319
You don't
have to lie,

16:57.386 --> 16:58.820
ok? I know.

16:59.755 --> 17:02.824
All right, so...

17:02.892 --> 17:04.759
5 wives in 2 1/2 years,

17:04.827 --> 17:07.429
and every one of 'em
on the rebound.

17:07.496 --> 17:10.397
I couldn't even get near you
when you were on the rebound.

17:10.465 --> 17:12.099
Maybe you didn't
try hard enough.

17:12.167 --> 17:13.702
Are you saying
I had a chance?

17:13.769 --> 17:14.769
You finished?

17:14.837 --> 17:17.372
Can we get back
to the case now?

17:17.423 --> 17:18.839
All right.

17:21.477 --> 17:22.711
Forkner Shorthand.

17:22.762 --> 17:25.914
Uh, excuse her French.
She's deaf.

17:25.982 --> 17:29.885
Could you say that again,
but just a touch slower?

17:29.936 --> 17:32.187
My friend here is
a little hard of understanding.

17:32.255 --> 17:34.089
Go.

17:34.156 --> 17:37.759
The writing in the notebook
is Forkner Shorthand.

17:37.827 --> 17:38.960
My sister told me.

17:39.028 --> 17:40.896
She uses it
all the time.

17:41.764 --> 17:42.931
Excellent.

17:42.999 --> 17:44.399
Great.

17:44.467 --> 17:46.401
What's for dessert?

17:47.603 --> 17:49.671
You have no idea
what she just said.

17:49.739 --> 17:51.306
Yeah, well, don't let her
know that, all right?

17:51.374 --> 17:53.041
Because it'll
break my heart.

17:53.108 --> 17:54.209
Thank you, Sarah.

17:54.276 --> 17:59.748
So you think George is
scamming these women?

17:59.815 --> 18:01.316
Look whose names came up.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.885
Police chief,
Judge Ramsey--

18:03.953 --> 18:06.755
Lily and Paula's
ex-husbands.

18:06.822 --> 18:08.657
And Thomas Dobson,

18:08.724 --> 18:10.258
the reptile
from the park.

18:10.326 --> 18:13.161
A list of men's names
and dollar amounts.

18:13.229 --> 18:15.797
Not so good
for the ex-wives.

18:15.865 --> 18:19.334
Maybe it's time
I hire Mr. Dobson.

18:26.375 --> 18:29.477
Judge Ramsey couldn't
recommend you highly enough.

18:31.380 --> 18:32.981
Sometimes I wish
attorney-client privilege

18:33.049 --> 18:34.449
was a 2-way street.

18:34.517 --> 18:35.450
Ah, yeah.

18:35.501 --> 18:37.919
All right. Well,
I'll be on my way, then.

18:37.987 --> 18:39.254
Mr. Foster.

18:42.258 --> 18:44.092
When the judge
came to see me,

18:44.160 --> 18:46.962
he wasn't
already divorced.

18:52.068 --> 18:55.720
Well, my ex-wife
is bleeding me dry,

18:55.805 --> 18:57.339
all right?

18:57.406 --> 18:59.774
She got a condo
in Key Biscayne,

18:59.842 --> 19:02.210
chauffer,

19:02.278 --> 19:04.179
flowers from Europe
daily.

19:04.246 --> 19:06.214
And you want
the bleeding stopped

19:06.282 --> 19:08.350
and stopped now.
Am I right?

19:08.417 --> 19:10.585
The problem is this.

19:10.653 --> 19:13.521
If you have
a preexisting arrangement,

19:13.589 --> 19:17.258
signed and sealed,
my hands are tied.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.528
Well, I had been
led to believe

19:20.596 --> 19:24.265
that you might have alternative
solutions to my problem.

19:27.536 --> 19:31.039
Look, everything
you need is in here.

19:31.107 --> 19:35.410
And also I took the liberty of
assuming that cash is king.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.612
And, uh...

19:37.680 --> 19:40.215
Don't think I've forgotten
about the dry cleaning.

19:40.282 --> 19:41.916
Cheers, Tom.

19:52.461 --> 19:53.962
You have
a smooth stroke,

19:54.030 --> 19:56.698
if you don't
mind me saying.

19:58.250 --> 19:59.868
You want
a real game?

19:59.919 --> 20:01.436
Loser buys drinks?

20:01.504 --> 20:04.272
How 'bout dinner?

20:05.474 --> 20:06.624
Ok.

20:09.078 --> 20:10.378
George.

20:10.429 --> 20:11.846
Gillian.

20:28.829 --> 20:31.548
Unforced errors
kill you every time.

20:31.615 --> 20:32.982
Oh, so it's not
my playing, then?

20:33.034 --> 20:35.452
Well, it's never
a winning strategy

20:35.503 --> 20:37.037
to compliment
your opponent.

20:37.121 --> 20:40.357
Oh, is that what I am,
your opponent?

20:40.424 --> 20:41.725
Well, what else
would you be?

20:41.792 --> 20:44.027
I'm a couple
of break points away

20:44.095 --> 20:45.628
from being
your dinner date.

20:45.696 --> 20:47.097
Heh heh heh.

20:53.204 --> 20:56.873
And there I was thinking you
might be the sore-loser type.

20:56.941 --> 20:59.142
Try this. Let me know
what you think.

20:59.210 --> 21:01.061
And I'm much better--

21:01.145 --> 21:02.912
at serving wine
than tennis balls?

21:02.980 --> 21:05.348
Actually, I was gonna say
I'm much better

21:05.416 --> 21:07.450
when I'm with
someone like you.

21:08.753 --> 21:10.520
Like me, huh?

21:10.588 --> 21:12.322
What am I like?

21:12.390 --> 21:13.723
The opposite of my ex.

21:13.791 --> 21:15.959
She would have found fault
with the wine,

21:16.027 --> 21:17.560
no matter
which one I picked.

21:17.628 --> 21:19.662
Please, don't I know it.

21:19.730 --> 21:21.698
I was married to exactly
the same type.

21:21.766 --> 21:25.602
Cal always had to be the
smartest person in the room.

21:26.637 --> 21:29.072
Every conversation
was a duel. I mean,

21:29.140 --> 21:30.206
talk about exhausting.

21:30.274 --> 21:33.877
With Megan, everything
was the bottom line--

21:33.944 --> 21:36.613
the price of everything,
the value of nothing, you know?

21:36.680 --> 21:38.314
Yeah, I don't
mind frugal,

21:38.382 --> 21:39.616
but I hate cheap.

21:39.683 --> 21:41.785
Cal would never
buy wine like this.

21:41.852 --> 21:42.819
That bit's true.

21:42.887 --> 21:45.422
Guy didn't know
what he had.

21:45.489 --> 21:48.425
And he was always looking at
every other woman who walked by,

21:48.492 --> 21:50.326
like sexual A.D.D.

21:51.362 --> 21:52.729
Yes, Torres?

21:52.797 --> 21:54.397
Nothing.

21:54.465 --> 21:55.398
His loss.

21:55.466 --> 21:57.467
Guys like that--
their own worst enemies.

21:57.535 --> 21:59.402
You know,
it's a pity, though,

21:59.470 --> 22:01.404
because underneath
all that stuff is--

22:01.472 --> 22:05.308
is an amazing, funny,
interesting mind.

22:05.376 --> 22:06.576
Did she just
call me sexy?

22:06.644 --> 22:08.745
No, she didn't.
She's playing a role.

22:08.813 --> 22:10.580
She did. She just
called me sexy.

22:10.648 --> 22:11.581
So what about you?

22:11.649 --> 22:13.983
It was a bad match.

22:14.051 --> 22:15.151
She was a Harvard lawyer.

22:15.219 --> 22:17.554
I was a college dropout
who ran a doggy day care.

22:17.621 --> 22:19.722
Yeah. Her, uh,
border collie

22:19.790 --> 22:21.958
fell in love
with my malamute.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.361
Cal always hated
big dogs.

22:25.429 --> 22:29.299
When we met, he had this
little pug called Isabelle.

22:29.366 --> 22:31.067
Oh. Big red flag.

22:32.136 --> 22:34.804
Oh, now she's having
way too much fun.

22:35.656 --> 22:37.707
This is
delicious wine.

22:37.775 --> 22:39.492
There's plenty more
where that came from.

22:39.577 --> 22:40.910
Cheers.

22:40.978 --> 22:42.846
Cheers.

22:42.913 --> 22:44.280
She was a Harvard lawyer.

22:44.348 --> 22:47.383
I was a college dropout running
a doggy day-care service.

22:48.619 --> 22:50.987
No facial or body language
deception indicators.

22:51.055 --> 22:52.222
No verbal ones either.

22:52.289 --> 22:53.857
So either he's
telling the truth,

22:53.924 --> 22:55.325
which we know is
not the case, or--

22:55.392 --> 22:57.660
or he's such
an amazing liar,

22:57.728 --> 23:00.230
we need to look for
sociopathic markers.

23:01.298 --> 23:03.600
You get a woman
fresh out of a divorce,

23:03.667 --> 23:06.069
wondering if she's gonna be
alone for the rest of her life,

23:06.137 --> 23:08.304
on the rebound.
It's the best time

23:08.372 --> 23:10.373
to figure out
which buttons to push.

23:10.441 --> 23:13.910
Well, you certainly
pushed Gillian's buttons.

23:13.978 --> 23:16.646
It's about
listening to her,

23:16.714 --> 23:18.581
mirroring her pain,

23:18.649 --> 23:22.485
and pouring an expensive
Pinot down her throat.

23:22.553 --> 23:23.887
What the hell?
She's happy.

23:23.954 --> 23:26.389
You could get out
from under.

23:26.457 --> 23:28.391
It's win-win.

23:28.459 --> 23:31.327
It's a win-win-win,
all right?

23:31.395 --> 23:33.329
Don't forget your part.

23:33.397 --> 23:36.633
Right. Once I
marry Gillian...

23:38.068 --> 23:40.803
You're free and clear,
no more alimony,

23:40.871 --> 23:43.473
except for 50%
of what would have been

23:43.541 --> 23:45.725
your monthly payment
for the next year.

23:45.809 --> 23:51.848
It's like an installment plan
on freedom.

23:52.783 --> 23:54.651
That's a good way
of puttin' it.

23:54.718 --> 23:55.885
I like that.

23:57.321 --> 23:59.689
So, do you wanna
do this, or what?

24:04.094 --> 24:05.361
Who are you?

24:05.429 --> 24:06.429
I'm the cop
on the other end

24:06.497 --> 24:07.497
of the wire
he's wearing.

24:07.565 --> 24:09.332
Get him out of here

24:09.400 --> 24:12.135
before I take a hammer
to this wanker.

24:15.339 --> 24:18.808
Conspiracy to commit
fraud, George. Not good.

24:18.876 --> 24:21.110
And Dobson walks,

24:21.178 --> 24:24.080
leaving you holding
your Pinot in your hand

24:24.148 --> 24:26.115
like the wanker
that you are.

24:26.183 --> 24:27.767
What do you need?

24:27.851 --> 24:29.285
Did you hear that?

24:29.353 --> 24:32.021
His voice went
all Michael Jackson just then.

24:32.089 --> 24:33.790
That's the fear,
that is,

24:33.857 --> 24:35.225
getting him
ready to sing.

24:35.292 --> 24:36.626
Full story...

24:36.694 --> 24:38.161
Everyone,
every transaction.

24:38.229 --> 24:41.631
And you're gonna have to do right
by all those women that you conned.

24:41.699 --> 24:43.283
How do I do it?

24:44.785 --> 24:48.071
All right,
well, let's see.

24:48.138 --> 24:49.956
Well, I don't think
writing each of them

24:50.040 --> 24:52.375
a rubber check is
gonna do it. Do you?

24:52.443 --> 24:54.844
No.

24:54.912 --> 24:56.479
So what do I do?

24:56.547 --> 24:58.914
I mean, you guys
have a plan, right?

24:58.966 --> 25:00.550
Oh, bollocks.

25:00.618 --> 25:03.353
You're about as much use as a
back pocket on a shirt, you are.

25:03.420 --> 25:04.920
Hey,
I'm cooperating here.

25:04.972 --> 25:07.290
You're desperate.
You'll make a lousy witness, George.

25:08.225 --> 25:09.826
Sorry. I couldn't
hold him off.

25:09.893 --> 25:11.277
Oh, that's all right.

25:12.630 --> 25:17.934
This is
this man's lawyer.

25:19.119 --> 25:20.403
M-Mr. Foster?

25:20.471 --> 25:22.572
Heh.
That's enough out of you.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.507
So you took your time,
didn't you?

25:24.575 --> 25:27.343
What kept you? You stop
for an hot dog, did you?

25:27.411 --> 25:29.462
He's not saying
another word.

25:29.546 --> 25:31.347
Problem with that,

25:31.415 --> 25:32.815
talk to
Judge Ramsey.

25:32.883 --> 25:34.851
Speaking of
Judge Ramsey,

25:34.918 --> 25:37.654
George's record
of all his transactions

25:37.721 --> 25:39.455
and clients that you
set him up with.

25:39.506 --> 25:42.725
That's a copy made
in plain text,

25:42.793 --> 25:45.628
just to clarify things
from his original.

25:51.302 --> 25:52.468
Let's go.

25:52.536 --> 25:55.204
Oh, no. Hang on. Hang on, lads.
Seriously. Wait.

25:55.272 --> 25:57.307
You know, you're gonna
love this bit.

26:01.578 --> 26:03.813
Say hello
to your fans, Georgie.

26:03.881 --> 26:06.182
Paula.

26:07.384 --> 26:08.318
Ingrid.

26:08.385 --> 26:09.319
I know.

26:09.386 --> 26:11.054
Oh.

26:11.121 --> 26:12.588
Lily.

26:16.894 --> 26:19.729
I really did care
for all of you.

26:28.038 --> 26:28.971
Whoa.

26:29.039 --> 26:30.907
I know.

26:30.974 --> 26:32.308
He's a total cipher,

26:32.376 --> 26:35.578
and I'm gonna crack him
if it's the last thing I do.

26:48.008 --> 26:49.208
Sod it.

26:49.276 --> 26:50.343
Who is it?!

26:50.411 --> 26:52.245
Police. Open up.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.547
I'm not decent!

26:54.615 --> 26:57.216
Yeah, tell me
somethin' I don't know.

27:01.155 --> 27:02.488
Here.

27:08.629 --> 27:10.663
My daughter's
out of town.

27:10.731 --> 27:12.331
Oi, eh?

27:12.399 --> 27:16.502
The D.A.'s not exactly jumpin' at
the chance to go after George.

27:16.570 --> 27:18.371
Oh, yeah?

27:18.439 --> 27:19.372
Why?

27:19.440 --> 27:21.741
'Cause all those
names in that book?

27:21.809 --> 27:23.976
Yeah, the chief of police
being one of 'em.

27:24.044 --> 27:26.612
So you just got run over
by the wheels of justice,

27:26.680 --> 27:29.415
and you come over here for a
shoulder to cry on. Is that it?

27:29.483 --> 27:32.051
Yeah, because that's me
all the way.

27:32.119 --> 27:33.720
I was in the neighborhood.

27:33.787 --> 27:36.856
True, yet iffy.

27:39.526 --> 27:41.794
I would take that,
if I were you.

27:42.963 --> 27:43.896
Here.

27:45.866 --> 27:47.567
Tell him from me

27:47.634 --> 27:50.970
that I'm not backing off
this one little bit.

27:53.941 --> 27:54.907
Wallowski.

27:54.975 --> 27:56.976
Wallowski,
George Walker's garage

27:57.044 --> 27:59.846
just went up in flames with him it.
Units responding.

27:59.913 --> 28:00.980
Oops.

28:28.559 --> 28:31.544
What are the odds this one gets
written off as an accident?

28:31.612 --> 28:33.879
Pretty damn good,
I'd say.

28:33.931 --> 28:37.784
There are 3 angry ex-wives
we need to talk to.

28:37.851 --> 28:43.222
Ok, let's start
with the basics.

28:43.290 --> 28:45.258
Tell me about George.

28:47.060 --> 28:50.263
Um, not exciting,

28:50.330 --> 28:52.899
but pleasant.

28:52.966 --> 28:54.400
After my
first marriage,

28:54.468 --> 28:58.638
I wanted pleasant,
nice, reliable.

28:58.705 --> 29:01.707
A dreamer?
Meaning what exactly.

29:01.775 --> 29:04.076
Um, let's see.

29:04.144 --> 29:06.612
Unpredictable,
spontaneous,

29:06.680 --> 29:08.581
George was
a commercial artist,

29:08.649 --> 29:10.249
but wanted
to be Picasso,

29:10.317 --> 29:12.518
which is exactly
what I needed.

29:12.586 --> 29:16.122
George was just what I
needed when I needed it...

29:18.158 --> 29:19.192
An adult.

29:19.259 --> 29:21.360
How was the, um...

29:21.428 --> 29:23.262
Uh, sex?

29:23.330 --> 29:24.797
Yes. Thank you.

29:24.865 --> 29:26.833
George was interesting.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.801
Was never a dull moment.

29:28.869 --> 29:30.670
Unimaginative.

29:30.737 --> 29:32.104
Sex wasn't
his thing.

29:32.172 --> 29:34.407
Listen, George
may have duped me,

29:34.474 --> 29:38.010
but the guy I wish was dead
was that lawyer, Dobson,

29:38.078 --> 29:40.112
my ex's pit bull.

29:40.180 --> 29:42.815
If I was gonna kill anyone,
it would have been him.

29:42.883 --> 29:45.518
That bastard Dobson
is the one

29:45.586 --> 29:46.752
who planned
this whole thing.

29:46.820 --> 29:49.488
George hurt me.

29:52.259 --> 29:54.126
I can deal
with the pain.

29:54.194 --> 29:56.896
I've been hurt worse.

29:59.666 --> 30:01.934
But what
he did to Noah...

30:04.037 --> 30:06.205
That, I can't forgive.

30:07.107 --> 30:09.041
Enough to kill him?

30:12.646 --> 30:15.548
I'm sorry he's dead.

30:15.616 --> 30:17.033
Sorry with her words.

30:17.117 --> 30:18.918
Not sorry
with her actions.

30:18.986 --> 30:20.920
And actions speak
louder than words.

30:20.988 --> 30:21.988
Listen to her tone.

30:22.055 --> 30:23.823
She's saying it
even though it's not there,

30:23.891 --> 30:25.091
"I'm not sorry he's dead."

30:25.158 --> 30:26.659
Well, that's
not surprising.

30:26.727 --> 30:30.029
She's the only one with a
child tangled up in this.

30:30.097 --> 30:31.898
George was
a social chameleon.

30:31.965 --> 30:34.667
With each of these women,
he adapted his behavior.

30:34.735 --> 30:36.569
You guys
gotta watch this.

30:41.408 --> 30:44.076
This is Lily and Noah
after you spoke with her.

30:54.254 --> 30:56.889
Talk about actions
speaking louder than words.

30:57.824 --> 31:00.192
Get those two back in here.

31:00.260 --> 31:02.428
Use your cuffs
if you have to.

31:05.837 --> 31:07.454
I'm not a criminal.

31:08.397 --> 31:10.431
You see your face
right now?

31:11.800 --> 31:13.067
You're like this one.

31:13.135 --> 31:14.369
You saying
I'm a dumb-ass?

31:14.436 --> 31:15.970
I'm saying you're angry.

31:16.038 --> 31:19.040
Funny, but angry.

31:20.676 --> 31:25.280
You see how your son's
body's angled away from you?

31:25.347 --> 31:26.814
That's mistrust,

31:26.882 --> 31:28.316
even revulsion.

31:29.451 --> 31:30.885
You're angry.

31:30.953 --> 31:33.988
That is the same anger you had
when you saw George in the cube.

31:34.056 --> 31:35.456
We were
all angry then.

31:35.524 --> 31:38.159
You weren't all angry with the
intent to do something about it.

31:38.227 --> 31:39.727
How can you
even know that?

31:39.795 --> 31:42.230
When you were outside the cube,
watching George,

31:42.298 --> 31:44.899
all three of you showed anger
in your physical response,

31:44.967 --> 31:47.568
but only you
are leaning forward.

31:47.636 --> 31:49.470
That shows intent.

31:49.538 --> 31:50.772
I'm not
a violent person.

31:50.839 --> 31:52.940
Well, not even
to protect your son?

31:53.008 --> 31:55.109
I mean, that's
a powerful instinct.

31:56.645 --> 31:58.212
That's guilt.

31:58.280 --> 32:02.183
And what you just did
with your mouth, regret.

32:02.251 --> 32:04.585
The whole story's
all over your face, Lily.

32:04.653 --> 32:08.389
Did you go to George's
garage last night?

32:08.457 --> 32:10.758
No, I did not.

32:13.329 --> 32:15.163
I gotta
go see my son.

32:15.230 --> 32:17.799
You can't keep me
from my son.

32:21.570 --> 32:23.638
Your son knows
that you went

32:23.706 --> 32:24.939
to George's garage
last night.

32:25.007 --> 32:25.973
Don't you, Noah?

32:26.041 --> 32:27.375
They're saying
I killed George, honey.

32:27.443 --> 32:30.712
If I were you,
I'd call a lawyer.

32:31.847 --> 32:32.714
Come on.

32:32.781 --> 32:36.017
She didn't kill him. I did.

32:36.085 --> 32:37.552
Noah.
I stole the bike,

32:37.619 --> 32:40.088
and I burned his place down.
I did it.

32:51.667 --> 32:53.334
Hi.

32:53.402 --> 32:57.472
So Noah thinks
you killed George.

32:59.074 --> 33:00.341
That much, we know.

33:00.409 --> 33:03.277
At first, it scared him.

33:03.345 --> 33:06.647
And now he's--he just
wants to protect you.

33:13.122 --> 33:15.022
Your mum didn't do it.

33:18.594 --> 33:20.862
The question is
why'd you think she did.

33:20.929 --> 33:23.464
And it's not just
'cause she went there.

33:23.532 --> 33:26.200
I burned his garage.

33:27.503 --> 33:28.703
Right.

33:32.441 --> 33:35.410
How'd you
start the fire?

33:35.477 --> 33:36.744
Gas from the motorcycle.

33:36.812 --> 33:37.645
Bollocks.

33:37.713 --> 33:39.313
That's bollocks.

33:39.381 --> 33:41.349
It was started
with paint thinner.

33:41.417 --> 33:42.350
Not true.

33:42.418 --> 33:43.718
Your word
against mine.

33:43.786 --> 33:45.820
Noah, it's ok.

33:45.888 --> 33:48.322
Whatever you know,
just tell him.

33:54.963 --> 33:57.899
My mom came home
freaked out...

33:57.966 --> 34:00.735
Like something bad
happened.

34:07.376 --> 34:08.909
And had it?

34:10.062 --> 34:12.580
I went to see George
last night.

34:14.283 --> 34:15.882
He threatened me.

34:15.951 --> 34:17.851
Never seen him
act like that.

34:17.902 --> 34:21.188
So I threw his ring
back at him,

34:21.255 --> 34:24.625
and he--he put me
up against the wall,

34:24.693 --> 34:27.562
put his hands
around my neck.

34:27.629 --> 34:29.996
I thought he
was gonna kill me...

34:30.866 --> 34:32.766
So I ran away.

34:35.204 --> 34:37.505
I didn't
kill anybody.

34:37.572 --> 34:39.774
You don't have
to lie for me.

34:39.842 --> 34:43.244
It's another version
of gorgeous George.

34:46.447 --> 34:47.915
So what do you reckon?

34:47.983 --> 34:49.467
What do I reckon
about what?

34:49.551 --> 34:52.687
Well, you still wanna confess
to a murder she didn't commit?

34:53.989 --> 34:56.422
Dobson's car just showed up
at Dulles International.

34:56.475 --> 34:57.758
He's on the move.

34:57.826 --> 34:59.627
Dobson
killed George?

35:00.462 --> 35:03.264
George and Dobson...

35:03.332 --> 35:06.234
That's the issue.

35:23.719 --> 35:25.052
Over there.

35:29.024 --> 35:29.957
Dobson.

35:30.025 --> 35:31.192
No. See,

35:31.260 --> 35:33.160
it's all in the body
language, right?

35:33.228 --> 35:36.731
So you stick with me,
you'll learn something.

35:39.268 --> 35:40.902
Here's your psycho.

35:44.206 --> 35:46.607
Honeymoon's over,
Georgie.

35:47.576 --> 35:49.310
Let's go.

35:59.545 --> 36:01.312
You're a tosser!

36:02.545 --> 36:04.613
You gave yourself away,
George.

36:04.681 --> 36:07.516
It was George the killer

36:07.583 --> 36:09.217
that scared Lily that night.

36:09.285 --> 36:11.286
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

36:11.354 --> 36:13.422
It's the same George
I saw in here

36:13.489 --> 36:15.423
when Dobson lost
his rag with you

36:15.475 --> 36:16.475
about that notebook,
right?

36:16.559 --> 36:18.393
I wouldn't hurt Dobson.
He was my friend.

36:18.461 --> 36:19.494
I'm an innocent man.

36:19.562 --> 36:21.596
Well, I've gotta say,
I think that you do

36:21.664 --> 36:24.232
an excellent
impersonation of one.

36:24.300 --> 36:26.001
I really do.

36:29.205 --> 36:30.322
Hang on.

36:30.406 --> 36:33.742
How do I compare?

36:33.810 --> 36:35.811
Couple choirboys.

36:37.780 --> 36:41.282
You're a right laugh,
you are.

36:41.334 --> 36:43.452
And when I say, "laugh,"
I don't mean that

36:43.519 --> 36:45.987
to sound like I find you
in any way amusing.

36:47.557 --> 36:50.525
There's no evidence
that I did anything.

36:50.593 --> 36:55.564
Think of this
as a reverse lineup.

37:00.520 --> 37:03.271
Ladies, is this the
man you saw leaving

37:03.339 --> 37:05.173
the burning garage
where Dobson died?

37:06.542 --> 37:08.777
Yes. Yep.
Absolutely.

37:08.845 --> 37:10.345
They're lying.

37:11.381 --> 37:12.347
Look at them.

37:12.415 --> 37:13.949
You're the scientist.

37:14.016 --> 37:15.083
Well, from the look of you,

37:15.151 --> 37:17.219
I'd say they're honest
as the day is long, mate.

37:17.286 --> 37:19.554
And dead right.

37:19.622 --> 37:21.540
Thank you, ladies.

37:25.094 --> 37:27.229
Premeditated murder.

37:27.296 --> 37:30.132
Death penalty's
on the table.

37:30.199 --> 37:34.870
That's 3 exceedingly
attractive wronged women.

37:34.937 --> 37:37.873
Catnip to a jury, that is.

37:38.808 --> 37:42.077
You don't want me.
I'm a nobody.

37:42.145 --> 37:44.713
I'd say you're a lot
of different nobodies.

37:44.781 --> 37:47.582
Dobson thought
I was gonna talk.

37:47.650 --> 37:50.919
He came after me.
I defended myself.

37:50.987 --> 37:52.354
Give me a break here.

37:52.422 --> 37:54.089
There he is,
cooperative George.

37:54.157 --> 37:57.092
I was wondering when
he was gonna rock up.

37:57.160 --> 37:59.728
You testify against Judge
Ramsey, the chief of police,

37:59.796 --> 38:01.263
and all the others,

38:01.330 --> 38:03.932
death penalty
comes off the table.

38:05.768 --> 38:07.602
And for
your next role...

38:08.805 --> 38:10.972
Behind bars...

38:11.040 --> 38:14.209
You get to play the
wronged wife this time.

38:18.915 --> 38:21.616
Who is he, really?

38:21.684 --> 38:23.952
He was
a lot of people.

38:24.020 --> 38:26.121
He become whoever
he needed to be.

38:26.189 --> 38:28.156
I'm sorry, Noah.

38:28.224 --> 38:29.691
It doesn't matter.

38:32.295 --> 38:33.728
Oi, hey.

38:33.780 --> 38:35.997
Here. You should
have this.

38:37.200 --> 38:39.100
George took that picture.

38:39.168 --> 38:40.335
Yeah, I know.

38:40.403 --> 38:43.071
It's more than
just a snapshot.

38:43.122 --> 38:43.972
What do you mean?

38:44.040 --> 38:46.374
Well, there's--
there's a language

38:46.442 --> 38:47.876
to photographic
composition, mate--

38:47.944 --> 38:49.878
framing, everything.

38:49.946 --> 38:54.316
It tells you what he
felt about you, so...

38:56.919 --> 38:58.353
Right.

38:58.420 --> 38:59.354
See you.

38:59.421 --> 39:00.472
Enjoy the bike.

39:00.556 --> 39:03.141
What bike?

39:03.226 --> 39:04.759
His bike.

39:04.827 --> 39:06.394
Be safe.

39:13.986 --> 39:17.172
That was a nice thing
you did for Noah.

39:18.574 --> 39:22.544
Why are you looking at me
like I just shot your dog?

39:23.946 --> 39:25.547
I don't have a dog.

39:25.615 --> 39:29.184
I don't even like dogs,
according to you,

39:29.252 --> 39:32.287
apart from a pug
named Isabelle.

39:32.338 --> 39:34.656
It did Noah good to hear
that George cared,

39:34.724 --> 39:35.991
even if it isn't true.

39:36.058 --> 39:37.959
How'd you know
it's not true?

39:38.027 --> 39:41.162
Mm, is it true?
I've never heard that theory.

39:41.230 --> 39:44.633
Well, science, right,

39:44.700 --> 39:47.869
like many other things in life,
is open to interpretation.

39:47.937 --> 39:49.371
Oh, please.
Not that again.

39:53.743 --> 39:55.076
Oh, thank you.

39:55.144 --> 39:57.045
I didn't say anything.

39:57.113 --> 39:58.813
Really?

39:58.881 --> 40:01.249
You just called me sexy.

40:05.354 --> 40:07.122
Right, Isabelle?

40:15.565 --> 40:18.466
Oh. How was Chicago?
Did mum like that present?

40:18.534 --> 40:21.269
How'd I know that was the first
question you were gonna ask?

40:21.337 --> 40:23.171
I'm that predictable?

40:23.239 --> 40:25.340
Really, dad?
A penis gourd?

40:25.408 --> 40:27.175
Is that
what she called it?

40:27.243 --> 40:29.177
Uh, in Papua New Guinea,

40:29.245 --> 40:31.713
they're called a fertility
gourd, actually.

40:31.781 --> 40:34.215
Rudi thought
it was a fake nose.

40:34.283 --> 40:36.451
Rudi? Oh, yeah?

40:36.519 --> 40:38.553
Is that mom's
new fellow, is it?

40:38.621 --> 40:40.422
Mm-hmm.

40:40.489 --> 40:42.023
Serious?

40:42.091 --> 40:43.358
Yeah, seriously.

40:43.426 --> 40:46.361
No. I mean
are they serious?

40:47.229 --> 40:50.465
Uh, yeah, a little, I think.

40:53.302 --> 40:55.203
Where'd you put
the remote?

41:04.113 --> 41:06.081
Smartass.

41:08.150 --> 41:10.318
So...

41:10.386 --> 41:12.320
You like
this Rudi fella?

41:12.388 --> 41:13.355
Yeah. He's nice.

41:13.422 --> 41:15.457
Ah. Well, then,
I'm fine.

41:15.524 --> 41:17.359
He's no Cal Lightman, though.

41:17.426 --> 41:19.661
Oh, mum must
be devastated.

41:19.729 --> 41:22.263
Yeah, because she told me
what she's really looking for

41:22.331 --> 41:25.066
is another workaholic who'd always
know what she was gonna say

41:25.134 --> 41:28.303
and would contradict her before she
even got the chance to say it,

41:28.371 --> 41:30.639
eats beans on toast
twice a week,

41:30.706 --> 41:33.041
whose wardrobe consists
of 15 pairs

41:33.109 --> 41:35.093
of the same jeans,
jackets, and shirts,

41:35.177 --> 41:38.213
and who likes to make fun
of any and all authority,

41:38.280 --> 41:41.182
even if it's his ex-wife
who lives 1,200 miles away.

41:41.250 --> 41:43.551
Yeah, there's not many
of us about.

41:43.619 --> 41:45.286
I know. It's a shame.

41:45.354 --> 41:47.389
So instead, she got Rudi,

41:47.456 --> 41:48.790
with an "I."

41:48.858 --> 41:49.791
With an "I"?

41:49.859 --> 41:51.026
Aye, aye.

41:51.093 --> 41:52.060
Heh. So, what,

41:52.128 --> 41:54.062
you saved the best bit
till last, did you?

41:54.130 --> 41:56.131
I knew you'd like that part.

41:59.969 --> 42:02.904
Don't grow up
too fast, em.

42:02.972 --> 42:04.839
I'll try not to.

42:04.907 --> 42:07.275
Right.

42:07.343 --> 42:08.276
Come on.

42:08.344 --> 42:11.179
I can help with
that part, if you like.

42:11.247 --> 42:12.380
Beans on toast?

42:13.916 --> 42:15.083
Ok, love?
