WEBVTT

00:11.568 --> 00:13.768
Is that the Gossip?

00:13.770 --> 00:15.703
No, that's the Slut.

00:15.705 --> 00:18.173
She's not a slut. She's a flirt.

00:18.175 --> 00:20.775
How many guys on the show
has she hooked up with?

00:20.777 --> 00:22.643
How many guys are on the show?

00:25.774 --> 00:29.437
She's not gonna fool
anyone with those glasses.

00:31.121 --> 00:33.188
Here. Bring this to Diane.

00:33.190 --> 00:34.389
What is it?

00:34.391 --> 00:35.984
Nothing.

00:38.124 --> 00:40.727
Okay, uh, reality,
you know, as in "real,"

00:40.730 --> 00:42.863
as in "it happened
and we just filmed it."

00:42.865 --> 00:45.366
Your argument is that reality
shows are actually real?

00:45.369 --> 00:48.076
No, my argument is that
we don't control the cast.

00:48.079 --> 00:49.446
They behave and we observe.

00:49.449 --> 00:50.715
They are as they appear.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.307
- Just like Donald Trump.
- Wait a minute,

00:52.309 --> 00:53.805
- he wasn't on our network.
- That... Let's get back... Excuse me.

00:53.807 --> 00:55.210
Let's get back to the questioning.

00:55.212 --> 00:57.378
Please, please. Melanie.

00:57.380 --> 01:00.581
Your show put us in that penthouse.

01:00.583 --> 01:02.152
It gave us alcohol,

01:02.155 --> 01:04.087
and it told us that
ratings were dependent

01:04.090 --> 01:05.732
on us pushing the sexual content...

01:05.735 --> 01:07.214
So you did push the sexual content?

01:07.217 --> 01:09.117
Let her finish.

01:09.120 --> 01:13.361
Then your cameramen kept
filming while I was violated.

01:13.363 --> 01:14.762
Your show was more interested

01:14.764 --> 01:16.988
in making good TV than protecting me.

01:16.991 --> 01:18.547
Thank you for that excellent speech.

01:18.550 --> 01:20.902
- Come on...
- Let me ask you this, Melanie.

01:20.905 --> 01:22.204
You were violated, you say.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.874
But you don't remember you were violated

01:23.877 --> 01:25.910
because you also claimed
you were unconscious?

01:25.913 --> 01:27.775
As I said, the show gave us alcohol

01:27.777 --> 01:29.863
- and very little food.
- Who is that guy?

01:29.866 --> 01:31.589
- I can find out.
- Yes.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.027
- No. Get Jay.
- I'm fine.

01:34.030 --> 01:35.783
the only reason you
know you were violated

01:35.785 --> 01:37.640
was because one of our
producers stopped the shooting.

01:37.642 --> 01:38.707
Not until the next day.

01:38.710 --> 01:42.456
So why aren't you suing
Blake for $4.5 million?

01:42.459 --> 01:44.725
He was the cast member
who violated you, right?

01:44.727 --> 01:46.694
Why are we the ones so honored?

01:46.696 --> 01:49.116
I think that Blake was
a victim, just like me.

01:49.119 --> 01:51.863
Melanie, he had sex with you
while you were unconscious.

01:51.866 --> 01:53.121
That's what you claim.

01:53.124 --> 01:55.278
I'm still not sure why
he's not in handcuffs.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.187
As a woman, that's what I would want.

01:57.190 --> 02:00.582
- But I guess we're the deep pockets here, so...
- Objection.

02:00.585 --> 02:03.678
Do you recognize this
contract, Ms. Clark?

02:03.680 --> 02:05.713
I do.

02:05.715 --> 02:06.914
And...

02:06.916 --> 02:09.241
would you mind reading for me this...

02:09.244 --> 02:11.586
highlighted portion right there?

02:11.588 --> 02:13.454
"Cast Member acknowledges that the Show,

02:13.456 --> 02:15.859
Chicago Penthouse..."

02:15.862 --> 02:19.294
- Would you like me to finish?
- That is not what happened here.

02:19.296 --> 02:22.601
"Chicago Penthouse does not
encourage sexual behavior..."

02:22.604 --> 02:24.218
Of course you encourage sexual behavior.

02:24.221 --> 02:27.835
"and is not responsible for
any emotional or bodily harm

02:27.838 --> 02:29.937
that results from
engaging in such behavior

02:29.939 --> 02:32.440
with fellow cast members."

02:32.442 --> 02:33.974
Who was that?

02:33.976 --> 02:35.910
Food delivery. He was
on the wrong floor.

02:35.912 --> 02:37.512
Where was his food?

02:37.514 --> 02:40.581
I don't know. I think at reception?

02:40.583 --> 02:42.450
Should I go check?

02:42.452 --> 02:44.254
Yes.

02:46.689 --> 02:48.956
Hey, you were great last season.

02:48.958 --> 02:50.148
Thank you.

02:50.151 --> 02:52.960
You're not getting $4.5 million.

02:52.962 --> 02:54.495
The sex was consensual.

02:54.497 --> 02:55.734
You just heard it wasn't.

02:55.737 --> 02:58.437
No, what I just heard was a
woman who was tightly scripted.

02:58.440 --> 03:01.936
- Seriously?
- Your show kept filming while I was violated."

03:01.938 --> 03:03.975
Melanie does not talk
like that. Come on.

03:03.978 --> 03:06.110
Maybe not on your reality
show, where she's scripted

03:06.113 --> 03:07.772
- to be a bimbo.
- Instead of here, where she's scripted

03:07.774 --> 03:10.951
- to be a Vassar post-grad student?
- All right. What's your offer?

03:10.954 --> 03:13.876
80 grand. The kill fee for
not showing the episo...

03:13.879 --> 03:16.010
You know you have no case, right?

03:16.013 --> 03:17.817
- No, you know what our case is?
- What?

03:17.820 --> 03:19.454
- Your fear, Ms. Stevens.
- Oh, no.

03:19.456 --> 03:21.431
- I'm really scared now.
- This contract.

03:21.434 --> 03:22.857
"You hand over all your rights,

03:22.859 --> 03:24.345
and you can't sue for any reason"?

03:24.348 --> 03:27.415
- All standard in the industry.
- And that's why you'll pay.

03:27.418 --> 03:29.985
You are scared to death we
will rip this apart in court.

03:29.988 --> 03:34.001
If a judge throws out your contract,
reality TV has to play fair.

03:34.003 --> 03:36.504
You have misread your power.

03:36.506 --> 03:38.773
Uh, one thing, Ms. Stevens.

03:38.775 --> 03:40.220
You can call me Andrea.

03:40.223 --> 03:42.259
- Andrea.
- Yes, Adrian.

03:44.013 --> 03:46.547
Here's our official
request for all the footage

03:46.549 --> 03:48.451
from the day in question.

03:49.551 --> 03:51.290
That's proprietary.

03:51.293 --> 03:52.389
You want to bet?

03:54.000 --> 04:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:05.485 --> 04:07.306
I'm so sorry.

04:07.309 --> 04:10.540
I didn't realize how
much on edge you were with

04:10.543 --> 04:13.006
what's been going on this past week.

04:13.009 --> 04:15.274
I mean, a couple of lawyers get killed,

04:15.277 --> 04:18.278
and you all think that you
have targets on your backs.

04:18.281 --> 04:21.981
I-I was gonna throw those
files directly at you, but, uh,

04:21.983 --> 04:24.752
I was afraid you'd wet yourselves.

04:24.754 --> 04:26.787
Brian, could you pick that up, please?

04:26.789 --> 04:28.829
I may need to use it again.

04:28.832 --> 04:33.235
All right, now, with respect
to this evidentiary request,

04:33.238 --> 04:34.712
uh, could somebody please

04:34.715 --> 04:37.337
explain to me the footage

04:37.340 --> 04:38.733
- and what's involved?
- Yes, Your Honor,

04:38.735 --> 04:40.710
- this material is proprietary...
- The videotape is vital...

04:42.605 --> 04:44.472
Bap! Bap! Bap!

04:44.474 --> 04:45.940
One at a time.

04:45.942 --> 04:47.642
You. Go.

04:47.644 --> 04:50.399
Hi, Your Honor. Andrea Stevens.

04:50.402 --> 04:52.202
- Thrilled to meet you.
- Oh, thank you.

04:52.205 --> 04:55.618
Likewise. Uh, the footage
shot by our producers

04:55.621 --> 04:57.392
is sometimes extremely personal.

04:57.395 --> 04:59.345
This is proprietary
material that shouldn't

04:59.348 --> 05:01.446
be casually exposed. In fact,

05:01.449 --> 05:03.349
it could embarrass,
potentially, our contestant,

05:03.352 --> 05:05.096
- so...
- These contestants agree

05:05.099 --> 05:07.762
to broadcast themselves
over 30 countries.

05:07.764 --> 05:10.030
But now that a lawsuit has been filed,

05:10.032 --> 05:12.187
the defense wants to
protect their privacy?

05:12.204 --> 05:15.993
- What is this show?
- It is a reality show called Chicago Penthouse.

05:15.996 --> 05:17.931
- Oy.
- And the goal of the contestants

05:17.934 --> 05:21.228
is to find a romantic match
among the other contestants.

05:21.231 --> 05:24.478
And if they don't, they get killed?

05:24.481 --> 05:25.880
That would be interesting.

05:25.882 --> 05:28.431
- No, they get sent home.
- Exhilarating.

05:28.434 --> 05:31.188
All right, let me see if I
understand this thing correctly.

05:31.191 --> 05:33.887
There's tons of footage
of these contestants?

05:33.890 --> 05:35.220
Yes. And the producers

05:35.223 --> 05:37.467
retain the right to use any

05:37.470 --> 05:39.894
or all of this footage for
broadcast? Is that right?

05:39.896 --> 05:41.529
- That is correct, Your Honor.
- Yes, that's exactly correct.

05:41.531 --> 05:45.099
Yeah. And-and somewhere
within all of this footage

05:45.101 --> 05:48.392
is evidence of an alleged assault?

05:48.395 --> 05:50.695
Correct. Right. Well, that would be, uh,

05:50.698 --> 05:52.565
material evidence, now, wouldn't it?

05:52.568 --> 05:55.061
- No, actually, what I think is that...
- You know what I think?

05:55.063 --> 05:57.240
What I think is that you, Ms. Stevens,

05:57.243 --> 05:58.743
should give them the tapes.

05:58.746 --> 05:59.976
And while you're at it,

05:59.979 --> 06:02.746
supply the court with duplicate copies.

06:02.749 --> 06:04.151
Pronto.

06:04.153 --> 06:06.046
That's a legal term.

06:06.049 --> 06:07.615
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Okay.

06:07.618 --> 06:10.966
Well, uh, I'm about to bang my gavel.

06:10.969 --> 06:14.303
So if, uh, anybody wants to
take cover under their desks,

06:14.306 --> 06:15.830
now's the time.

06:22.597 --> 06:24.968
_

06:28.827 --> 06:31.227
That's a video depo dump.

06:31.230 --> 06:32.691
The whole season.

06:32.694 --> 06:35.650
24-hour-a-day video
from a dozen cameras.

06:35.652 --> 06:36.917
And they sent them over

06:36.919 --> 06:38.786
with no time code or description.

06:38.788 --> 06:40.655
It's gonna take weeks
to go through all of it.

06:40.657 --> 06:42.990
I'll do it.

06:42.992 --> 06:44.191
Uh,

06:44.193 --> 06:46.130
it's up to you.

06:49.839 --> 06:52.122
Okay, guys! To season 14!

06:53.660 --> 06:56.649
Okay, that's Sheryl and Tina and Johnny.

06:56.652 --> 06:57.705
The one in the tank top.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.430
Everybody hates him
because he's a snake.

06:59.433 --> 07:01.223
- Kill me now.
- Next tape.

07:01.226 --> 07:02.891
This one's too early.

07:02.894 --> 07:04.779
So here's what I don't understand.

07:04.781 --> 07:07.065
You seem like a
semi-half-intelligent person.

07:07.068 --> 07:08.267
Thank you.

07:08.270 --> 07:09.469
How can you watch this?

07:09.472 --> 07:11.519
- You like football, right?
- Oh, come on,

07:11.522 --> 07:13.588
- you can't equate this with football.
- Let's talk about

07:13.590 --> 07:15.688
- chronic traumatic head injuries.
- I'm not criticizing

07:15.690 --> 07:17.289
what happens to the people on the show.

07:17.292 --> 07:19.477
I'm just criticizing what
happens to the viewer.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.180
Don't you have a guilty pleasure?

07:21.183 --> 07:24.899
Don't you watch YouTube
videos of guys diving onto ice

07:24.902 --> 07:27.805
or watch horror movies
or read comic books?

07:27.808 --> 07:29.000
You mean graphic novels?

07:29.003 --> 07:31.403
Oh, my God. Seriously?
And you make fun of me?

07:31.405 --> 07:33.205
Graphic novels are a new literature.

07:33.207 --> 07:35.374
Right. Like Steinbeck.

07:35.376 --> 07:38.210
What a hypocrite. Oh, wait.

07:38.212 --> 07:40.391
Wait, there. That-That's
the last Wrap-Up Circle.

07:40.394 --> 07:42.682
- How do you know?
- They're pairing up.

07:42.684 --> 07:43.916
Yeah.

07:50.144 --> 07:53.092
These are two camera angles.

07:53.094 --> 07:54.961
- ♪ It's your birthday... ♪
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:54.963 --> 07:56.829
You need some help, little lady?

07:56.831 --> 07:59.265
Well, that confirms the drunkenness.

07:59.267 --> 08:01.454
Oh, my God, turn on the bubbles!

08:01.457 --> 08:03.269
- I love jets!
- Wait, wait, wait,

08:03.271 --> 08:04.837
I don't have a-a swimsuit.

08:04.839 --> 08:06.372
I don't even own a swimsuit.

08:06.374 --> 08:08.775
♪ It's your birthday,
happy birthday... ♪

08:08.777 --> 08:10.894
Okay. That's not good.

08:10.897 --> 08:12.997
Well, it's still not consent.

08:14.849 --> 08:16.675
Isn't this on network TV?

08:16.678 --> 08:18.751
Yeah. They pixelate it.

08:21.189 --> 08:23.269
Uh, this goes on for a while.

08:31.866 --> 08:34.100
Okay. Now it's consent.

08:34.102 --> 08:35.835
She just instigated.

08:35.837 --> 08:38.010
- Cut it.
- Cameras off.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.173
Why are they hiding this?

08:41.174 --> 08:44.076
I mean, if it's not good for
us, why are they hiding it?

08:44.078 --> 08:45.812
It could be something
else in the footage.

08:45.814 --> 08:47.013
♪ It's your birthday... ♪

08:56.917 --> 08:57.790
Hi.

08:57.792 --> 08:58.958
I'm bored.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.126
That's my line.

09:00.128 --> 09:02.128
Everybody expected me to be in jail,

09:02.130 --> 09:04.063
so I have nothing to do.

09:04.065 --> 09:06.063
Are you going to your dad's arraignment?

09:06.066 --> 09:08.034
No. I think I'm done.

09:08.036 --> 09:11.500
It's weird. A year ago,
everything was normal.

09:11.503 --> 09:13.317
We'd have a party every Easter.

09:13.318 --> 09:15.625
Hey, you can come to my
house for Pesach this year.

09:15.628 --> 09:17.910
I'll even hide a few
Easter eggs for you.

09:17.912 --> 09:19.554
You know, I might take you up on that.

09:19.557 --> 09:21.080
We should get drunk at lunch.

09:22.483 --> 09:24.382
Who are you?

09:24.385 --> 09:25.585
A different person.

09:25.588 --> 09:28.387
A different genre of person. Oh.

09:28.389 --> 09:29.989
What?

09:29.991 --> 09:31.958
I don't know. Feels a little weird.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.948
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

We don't want it to go airborne.

11:28.176 --> 11:29.526
Wait, what...

11:29.529 --> 11:30.797
what is this?

11:31.956 --> 11:34.120
I don't know. It could be...

11:34.123 --> 11:35.523
What, baking powder?

11:35.525 --> 11:36.828
Uh...

11:36.831 --> 11:39.596
No. Looks too brown.

11:42.732 --> 11:45.944
"I'm bankrupt. I've lost
my wife. I've lost my kids.

11:45.947 --> 11:47.402
All because of you."

11:47.404 --> 11:49.606
Oh, fuck. It says it's ricin.

11:51.174 --> 11:53.994
Th-That's as bad as anthrax.

11:53.997 --> 11:55.398
Yes.

11:56.990 --> 11:58.525
Can you reach the glass?

12:00.066 --> 12:01.377
Yeah.

12:10.127 --> 12:12.860
No, no, no, no, no! Stay there!

12:12.862 --> 12:16.333
There is ricin in this letter.

12:17.964 --> 12:20.097
It says, "Kill all lawyers."

12:20.100 --> 12:21.764
Oh, God.

12:21.767 --> 12:23.604
Just like the other two killers.

12:23.606 --> 12:27.275
Jay, clear the floor.

12:27.277 --> 12:29.306
I'll call 911.

12:31.248 --> 12:33.448
Everyone, exit the building!

12:33.450 --> 12:35.842
Come on, let's go, let's
go! Leave the floor now!

12:35.845 --> 12:37.585
This is not a drill! Come on, let's go!

12:37.587 --> 12:40.011
Out. Come on. Let's go. Get up, get up.

12:40.014 --> 12:42.014
Tell everyone there's a-a
possible chemical threat.

12:42.017 --> 12:43.658
Get up, get out!

12:43.660 --> 12:45.826
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

12:45.828 --> 12:47.362
- Come on.
- Jay!

12:47.364 --> 12:49.400
- Yo!
- Jay, tell the building engineer

12:49.401 --> 12:50.771
to turn off the HVAC!

12:50.800 --> 12:54.302
Right. On it. Let's go,
let's go, let's go. Come on.

12:54.304 --> 12:56.339
We should breathe lightly, just in case.

13:08.551 --> 13:10.751
Kristen. What's wrong?

13:10.753 --> 13:13.230
Marissa found a letter.
A threatening letter.

13:13.233 --> 13:15.100
- From a client?
- To Diane.

13:15.103 --> 13:16.724
They think it's ricin.

13:16.726 --> 13:18.359
Ricin?

13:26.658 --> 13:28.280
Lucca.

13:28.283 --> 13:29.853
Stay there.

13:42.502 --> 13:44.134
What are you doing?

13:44.137 --> 13:45.753
Don't move.

13:45.755 --> 13:48.483
Lucca, one tiny atom of this stuff,

13:48.486 --> 13:50.258
- and you can be dead.
- Yes.

13:50.260 --> 13:52.260
And if you keep talking,

13:52.262 --> 13:54.295
you're gonna breathe it in.

13:54.297 --> 13:56.797
So shut up.

13:56.799 --> 13:58.333
Okay.

13:58.335 --> 14:00.501
Now, this isn't gonna look pretty.

14:00.503 --> 14:02.147
Emergency response is coming.

14:02.150 --> 14:03.486
They don't want you to move.

14:03.489 --> 14:05.440
They're worried you'll
send the spores airborne.

14:05.442 --> 14:06.541
Thanks. We know.

14:06.543 --> 14:08.278
Where did the envelope come from?

14:10.478 --> 14:12.347
No stamps.

14:12.349 --> 14:13.581
The mail room.

14:19.655 --> 14:21.555
This isn't a drill!

14:21.558 --> 14:22.990
Clear the floor now!

14:25.395 --> 14:26.861
Come on, guys. Let's go.

14:26.863 --> 14:28.563
Excuse me. Excuse me.

14:28.565 --> 14:29.897
Come on, come on. What's up?

14:29.899 --> 14:31.994
Come on, come on. Let's
go. Go, go, go, go.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.464
Oh, my... Jay! Jay!

14:38.274 --> 14:41.056
We have a possible
chemical attack situation.

14:41.059 --> 14:43.384
Do not touch your faces,
do not touch your clothes.

14:43.387 --> 14:45.880
Wait at the base of the stairs
for the emergency responders.

14:45.882 --> 14:46.947
Let's go!

14:46.949 --> 14:49.350
Come on!

14:54.424 --> 14:56.457
What's going on?

14:56.459 --> 14:57.658
Chemical scare.

14:57.660 --> 14:58.859
What? Where?

14:58.861 --> 15:00.087
Our floor.

15:00.090 --> 15:01.362
From a client?

15:01.364 --> 15:02.697
One of mine.

15:02.699 --> 15:04.999
Your husband is here.

15:06.803 --> 15:09.937
Oh, God, I hope they're being good.

15:09.939 --> 15:12.340
They just... they shut down

15:12.342 --> 15:14.267
the air conditioning, and we evacuated.

15:14.270 --> 15:16.608
Good, good. Hey, keep
these people down here.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.100
Isolate anyone who
exhibits any symptoms.

15:19.103 --> 15:21.616
We've got the hazard
material team going up now.

15:21.618 --> 15:24.585
- We still have employees up there.
- I understand.

15:24.587 --> 15:26.521
A mobile medical team is on the way.

15:26.523 --> 15:28.425
- Do you have a minute?
- Y-Yeah.

15:30.693 --> 15:32.393
Are you all right?

15:32.395 --> 15:34.731
Yeah. I-I wasn't here. I was at lunch.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.100
All right, good.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.800
- That's good.
- Okay.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.537
Okay, here it is. Ricin.

15:43.540 --> 15:45.298
Do you want to hear?

15:45.301 --> 15:47.842
I don't know. Do I?

15:47.844 --> 15:50.952
"Symptoms can begin any time
between one day and two months

15:50.955 --> 15:52.413
after the exposure."

15:52.416 --> 15:53.780
Oh.

15:53.783 --> 15:55.486
Like a pregnancy test.

15:55.489 --> 15:57.589
At least we won't
have to pee on a stick.

15:57.592 --> 15:59.720
- Oh, no.
- What?

15:59.722 --> 16:01.822
I think I'm gonna sneeze.

16:01.824 --> 16:04.091
- Don't.
- It's involuntary.

16:04.093 --> 16:07.495
Press your tongue between
your front teeth. It works.

16:07.497 --> 16:10.965
Okay, I think that did it.

16:10.967 --> 16:13.634
Oh, if we don't die, I'm
gonna get so drunk tonight.

16:21.444 --> 16:24.479
Hey there. How are you two doing?

16:24.481 --> 16:26.113
Really good.

16:26.115 --> 16:28.816
Just another day at
Reddick, Boseman & Lockhart.

16:28.818 --> 16:31.803
So, I'm Drew Lovatto,

16:31.806 --> 16:33.754
the Hazardous Materials Unit.

16:33.756 --> 16:35.890
Nice to meet you. Marissa Gold.

16:35.892 --> 16:37.992
- Maia.
- Hey.

16:37.994 --> 16:41.529
So, we're gonna take this
all very slowly, okay?

16:41.531 --> 16:43.194
Now, do either of you have

16:43.197 --> 16:45.131
any symptoms... Trouble breathing,

16:45.134 --> 16:47.331
coughing, skin irritations?

16:47.334 --> 16:49.801
I almost sneezed, but I've
gotten it under control.

16:49.804 --> 16:51.303
Good.

16:51.306 --> 16:54.442
I'm gonna put these
masks on your faces first.

16:54.444 --> 16:56.413
The napkins were a great idea.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.618
That a good fit?

17:03.620 --> 17:05.134
Perfect. Can I keep it?

17:05.137 --> 17:07.396
Sure. No Darth Vader
impressions, though.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.623
Damn.

17:08.625 --> 17:10.625
Okay, now, don't move yet.

17:10.627 --> 17:12.587
I see there's powder

17:12.589 --> 17:15.099
on the desk, your lap, your arm,

17:15.103 --> 17:17.532
and your hand... is it anywhere else?

17:17.536 --> 17:18.952
Not that we can see.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.131
So first, I'm gonna move you

17:21.134 --> 17:22.886
away from the desk, okay?

17:26.279 --> 17:27.766
I'm gonna need you...

17:27.769 --> 17:29.493
- Marissa.
- Marissa.

17:29.496 --> 17:30.795
I'm gonna need you, Marissa,

17:30.798 --> 17:32.786
to stand very carefully in one minute.

17:32.789 --> 17:35.823
But first, I'm gonna roll you
back away from the desk, okay?

17:35.826 --> 17:36.894
Okay.

17:49.022 --> 17:50.118
Okay.

17:52.175 --> 17:53.474
Now...

17:53.477 --> 17:55.045
I'm gonna get that powder

17:55.048 --> 17:57.190
out of your lap very carefully.

17:57.193 --> 17:59.193
Really? We hardly know each other.

17:59.196 --> 18:01.001
I'll be gentle.

18:01.004 --> 18:04.373
I need you to stand very
carefully, very slowly.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.476
- You ready?
- Yeah.

18:06.479 --> 18:07.778
And...

18:07.781 --> 18:09.217
stand.

18:13.981 --> 18:15.916
Okay, good. Stay right here.

18:17.318 --> 18:18.984
Now, I need you...

18:18.986 --> 18:22.688
to turn your hand over,
dump the powder in the bag.

18:22.690 --> 18:24.391
You've done this before?

18:24.394 --> 18:25.793
Yep. Once.

18:34.203 --> 18:37.341
Okay. Now I need you both
to step into these bags,

18:37.344 --> 18:39.939
remove your clothes, leave
them in the bottom of the bag.

18:39.941 --> 18:42.309
- In front of you?
- I'll turn around.

18:43.945 --> 18:46.882
I'll need you both to put these on.

18:54.756 --> 18:56.323
Done, Drew.

18:56.325 --> 18:57.805
Okay.

18:57.808 --> 19:00.203
If we survive this, we figured
we should get drunk tonight.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.204
You want to join us?

19:01.207 --> 19:03.305
Let's focus on surviving this first.

19:06.668 --> 19:08.304
Would you excuse me?

19:09.538 --> 19:10.904
Did you really

19:10.906 --> 19:12.639
just ask him out?

19:12.641 --> 19:14.076
I know. Weird, right?

19:14.079 --> 19:16.345
If I'm gonna die...

19:24.269 --> 19:26.130
Baking soda.

19:26.133 --> 19:27.523
What?

19:28.757 --> 19:30.957
- You do not need that.
- Oh...

19:30.959 --> 19:32.559
my God.

19:48.337 --> 19:50.237
- That's it?
- Yup.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.380
I'll get out of your hair.

19:52.383 --> 19:56.273
Saving the world one box
of baking soda at a time.

19:56.276 --> 19:57.575
You take care.

19:57.578 --> 19:59.278
I'm glad you didn't die.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.615
Hey, how about that drink?

20:03.317 --> 20:05.551
You know, that celebratory...

20:05.553 --> 20:07.618
"we didn't die" drink.

20:07.621 --> 20:09.655
Sounds fun, but I got to work late.

20:09.657 --> 20:11.923
Well, if you change your mind...

20:11.926 --> 20:15.194
we're gonna be in the
downstairs bar at 8:00.

20:15.196 --> 20:17.032
Got it.

20:21.036 --> 20:23.202
Wow, you are forward.

20:23.204 --> 20:24.685
"I'm bankrupt.

20:24.688 --> 20:26.321
I've lost my wife,

20:26.324 --> 20:28.237
I've lost my kids...

20:28.240 --> 20:30.058
all because of you.

20:30.061 --> 20:33.691
You overcharge me and
go on to your next case.

20:33.694 --> 20:35.245
Well, not this time.

20:35.247 --> 20:37.147
You're going to hurt just like me.

20:37.150 --> 20:38.681
This is ricin.

20:38.683 --> 20:41.179
Consider it in lieu of my last payment."

20:41.182 --> 20:43.436
"Lieu" is spelled L-O-O.

20:43.439 --> 20:45.702
Signed "A Client."

20:45.705 --> 20:47.806
We'll run fingerprints on
this, but there's something

20:47.809 --> 20:50.226
- you can do for me.
- What?

20:50.229 --> 20:52.331
I need a list of your clients.

20:53.631 --> 20:55.364
You know we can't do that.

20:55.367 --> 20:58.037
Just so you know, the
suspects are your clients,

20:58.040 --> 20:59.504
or at least Ms. Lockhart's clients,

20:59.507 --> 21:00.616
and I can't fully help you

21:00.619 --> 21:02.572
- unless I know their identities.
- Ian...

21:02.574 --> 21:05.468
our attorney-client privilege
prevents us from doing that.

21:05.471 --> 21:07.772
And for really, really good reason.

21:07.775 --> 21:09.405
Some of our clients might have

21:09.408 --> 21:11.608
future dealings with your department.

21:11.611 --> 21:13.366
You can get permission from them.

21:13.369 --> 21:14.690
Any client who wrote that letter

21:14.693 --> 21:16.067
wouldn't agree to put their name on it.

21:16.069 --> 21:18.035
And that would narrow down our suspects.

21:18.038 --> 21:19.689
Which we couldn't tell you.

21:19.691 --> 21:22.024
Look, someone is trying to kill you.

21:22.026 --> 21:24.394
This is not a joke.

21:24.396 --> 21:26.454
I'm here to help, I am not your enemy.

21:26.457 --> 21:30.400
But I can't do anything
unless you work with me.

21:30.402 --> 21:32.298
You know that's true.

21:32.301 --> 21:35.212
We can't represent our
clients at the same time

21:35.215 --> 21:37.254
that we're having the
police investigate them.

21:37.257 --> 21:39.008
Yeah, everything makes sense.

21:39.010 --> 21:41.072
Look, all I know is you were ten years

21:41.075 --> 21:42.337
at the Department of Justice,

21:42.340 --> 21:44.040
and I didn't worry about you once,

21:44.043 --> 21:46.176
and you've been here for
a month, and here we are.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.617
It's an unusual time.

21:47.619 --> 21:49.586
No, I don't think it is.

21:49.588 --> 21:52.220
I'm doing what I want.

21:55.860 --> 21:58.463
- Stay safe.
- Okay.

22:00.399 --> 22:01.964
This is fucked.

22:01.966 --> 22:04.601
It is... But he's right.

22:04.603 --> 22:07.404
We can't give him the client
names, he can't help us.

22:07.406 --> 22:10.039
Look, I'm new here, but
maybe we should be looking

22:10.041 --> 22:12.259
- at what we charge clients.
- What we charge clients

22:12.262 --> 22:15.167
is competitive with every
other law firm in town, Liz.

22:15.170 --> 22:18.071
Which is maybe why clients are
so angry with their lawyers.

22:18.074 --> 22:20.869
Are you really blaming
us? We're the victims here.

22:20.872 --> 22:23.272
Oh, come on, we are far from victims.

22:23.275 --> 22:25.308
Why don't I do some research

22:25.311 --> 22:26.978
into Diane's clients?

22:26.981 --> 22:28.983
How many are there?

22:31.496 --> 22:33.744
Uh, 43.

22:33.747 --> 22:35.347
Any of them upset about our billing

22:35.350 --> 22:37.486
or losing a case or whatever?

22:38.449 --> 22:40.980
- Yeah, right.
- Look,

22:40.983 --> 22:42.774
I'll get the letter back from the police

22:42.777 --> 22:44.777
and compare it to other correspondences.

22:44.779 --> 22:46.712
There was somebody here yesterday.

22:46.714 --> 22:49.415
A bearded man, delivering food.

22:49.417 --> 22:51.850
- Marissa talked to him.
- I'll keep you updated.

22:51.852 --> 22:54.120
Now, we need to get back on the phone

22:54.122 --> 22:55.621
with Andrea Stevens.

22:55.623 --> 22:57.558
We don't want to be
seen as being weak here.

23:02.261 --> 23:04.230
You okay?

23:04.232 --> 23:05.979
Oh, yeah.

23:05.982 --> 23:08.883
Yeah? Still want to
become a pastry chef?

23:08.886 --> 23:11.137
It's looking more and more appealing.

23:11.139 --> 23:13.139
Is there anything I can do?

23:13.141 --> 23:16.175
No, I just... I just
have to shake this off.

23:16.177 --> 23:18.211
Why don't you go home?

23:18.213 --> 23:19.645
Take the afternoon.

23:19.647 --> 23:21.780
If there's ever a day
you could take a break,

23:21.782 --> 23:23.751
it's after a ricin scare.

23:25.453 --> 23:28.254
I mean, maybe later. I'm
good. I have the depo.

23:28.256 --> 23:30.856
I'll handle it. Go.

23:30.858 --> 23:34.160
He really was just delivering food.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.694
He had nothing to do with this.

23:35.696 --> 23:37.396
Diane's getting a little paranoid.

23:37.399 --> 23:39.586
With good reason. You seem good.

23:39.589 --> 23:41.953
Yeah. I tend to rise to these occasions.

23:41.956 --> 23:44.203
- Are you questioning the mail room?
- Next stop.

23:44.205 --> 23:45.534
- Can I help?
- No.

23:45.537 --> 23:47.492
You take the reality show footage.

23:47.495 --> 23:48.676
I'm on it.

23:49.691 --> 23:51.710
I had wall-to-wall cops in here.

23:51.712 --> 23:53.646
They messed up my whole system.

23:53.648 --> 23:57.650
It's gonna take me three, four
hours just to get caught up.

23:57.652 --> 23:59.898
What's this?

23:59.901 --> 24:01.500
The threatening envelope came inside.

24:01.503 --> 24:02.806
Looks like it was hand-delivered here,

24:02.808 --> 24:05.660
then one of your guys brought
it up to Diane's office.

24:07.316 --> 24:08.827
Wasn't one of my guys.

24:08.829 --> 24:10.829
Doesn't everything go
through the mail room?

24:10.831 --> 24:12.665
Everything from the outside.

24:12.667 --> 24:15.102
This doesn't have a
signature, no time stamp.

24:15.105 --> 24:17.472
This came from inside the building.

24:19.965 --> 24:21.697
Oh, my gosh,

24:21.700 --> 24:23.441
I am so sorry.

24:23.444 --> 24:24.944
I heard.

24:24.947 --> 24:26.591
- About?
- About your troubles here.

24:26.594 --> 24:28.694
I mean, it seems like you
have some enemies, huh?

24:28.697 --> 24:31.884
If it helps, we could take
this case off your plate,

24:31.886 --> 24:33.619
come to some sort of settlement.

24:33.621 --> 24:34.653
Sure.

24:34.655 --> 24:36.355
$4.3 million.

24:36.357 --> 24:38.224
Mm, not quite what I had in mind.

24:38.226 --> 24:40.559
But 95... no, $95,000 would do it.

24:40.561 --> 24:42.017
Listen, you don't want to have

24:42.020 --> 24:44.297
another unhappy client
on your hands, do you?

24:44.299 --> 24:45.791
Shall we?

24:51.791 --> 24:53.290
Liz.

24:53.293 --> 24:55.093
What are you doing?

24:55.096 --> 24:56.858
Oh. Diane asked me to sit in.

24:56.861 --> 24:58.579
She's not feeling up to it.

24:59.747 --> 25:01.249
Yeah.

25:03.618 --> 25:06.752
Are you thirsty? Can I
get you something to drink,

25:06.754 --> 25:10.244
- maybe, or... or maybe not, you know?
- I really don't know.

25:12.150 --> 25:14.293
Where was this video taken?

25:14.295 --> 25:15.861
It was at the bar at the penthouse.

25:15.863 --> 25:17.851
They look pretty comfortable
with each other, don't they?

25:17.853 --> 25:19.665
That is speculation about
Melanie's state of mind,

25:19.667 --> 25:21.493
hours before the assault took place.

25:21.496 --> 25:22.743
Alleged assault.

25:22.746 --> 25:24.623
And you know there's
no judge here, right?

25:24.626 --> 25:26.472
I'm just preserving the
objection for the record.

25:26.474 --> 25:28.674
Of course. Preserved.

25:28.676 --> 25:30.976
Did you speak with Melanie
after this 3:00 encounter,

25:30.978 --> 25:32.122
but before the later one?

25:32.125 --> 25:33.679
I conducted an OTF.

25:33.681 --> 25:37.615
- And what is that?
- That's an "on the fly" interview.

25:37.618 --> 25:39.252
I had a great time with Blake.

25:39.254 --> 25:40.653
Yeah, I'm sensing that

25:40.655 --> 25:42.821
you and Blake have good chemistry.

25:42.823 --> 25:44.992
Yeah, you could say we're getting along.

25:44.995 --> 25:47.161
Sorry, sorry. Uh, use his name, please.

25:47.164 --> 25:49.495
Shit.

25:49.497 --> 25:51.664
Blake and I have great chemistry.

25:51.666 --> 25:54.833
He seems down to have a good time.

25:54.835 --> 25:59.772
Definitely someone to spend
some quality time with.

25:59.774 --> 26:02.308
So, you're turning our
client into a puppet,

26:02.310 --> 26:03.509
and then you blame her?

26:03.511 --> 26:05.411
Oh, my God.

26:05.413 --> 26:07.782
- What's wrong?
- I found something in the video.

26:10.985 --> 26:13.571
I'm starving. Can we
talk about this later?

26:13.574 --> 26:15.199
I don't even get what you're asking me.

26:15.202 --> 26:17.139
Oh, I think you know
exactly what I'm saying.

26:17.141 --> 26:19.227
I mean, Melanie, you talk the talk,

26:19.230 --> 26:21.427
- but I don't know.
- I don't understand.

26:21.429 --> 26:23.329
You give a good sound bite, honey,

26:23.331 --> 26:25.063
but TV is a visual medium.

26:25.065 --> 26:27.522
I need the video to back that up.

26:27.525 --> 26:29.724
You don't think that this is visual?

26:29.727 --> 26:32.638
Now, that top sums up the problem.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.907
You are a camera tease, Melanie.

26:35.910 --> 26:37.910
Melanie, you want to stay on the show?

26:37.912 --> 26:40.818
Then you gotta show us something.

26:40.821 --> 26:42.654
What did you mean by that?

26:42.657 --> 26:45.651
I just meant that, uh...

26:45.653 --> 26:48.954
You know, she was talking
a very big game, but, uh,

26:48.956 --> 26:51.680
in reality, she... She wasn't exactly...

26:51.683 --> 26:54.893
- Putting out?
- Excuse me, who is that?

26:54.895 --> 26:57.463
One of our investigators.

26:57.465 --> 27:00.336
Could you ask her not to
question my client, please?

27:00.339 --> 27:01.789
Sure. As soon as your client

27:01.792 --> 27:03.226
starts answering the questions.

27:03.229 --> 27:04.703
Look, everybody knows that

27:04.705 --> 27:07.873
our show's ratings go up or down

27:07.875 --> 27:09.875
based on us being provocative.

27:09.877 --> 27:12.255
That does not mean that we condone rape.

27:12.258 --> 27:13.375
Strong words.

27:13.378 --> 27:15.348
I'm sorry, I'm really confused here.

27:15.350 --> 27:17.015
I thought your whole argument

27:17.017 --> 27:18.717
was that she was unconscious.

27:18.719 --> 27:20.753
Now you're arguing that
we forced her to strip

27:20.755 --> 27:24.490
and receive oral sex.
I'm just... confused.

27:24.492 --> 27:27.793
Please, I'm starving.
Can I even get a sandwich?

27:27.795 --> 27:29.728
Yes, after the Wrap-Up.

27:29.730 --> 27:31.897
But look, they just put
out the tequila buffet.

27:31.899 --> 27:34.433
So, what is... what
is the tequila buffet?

27:34.435 --> 27:36.001
Well, all our...

27:36.003 --> 27:37.906
All our contestants
know that we had that.

27:37.909 --> 27:39.905
Yeah, but what... what
is it? I'm just curious.

27:39.907 --> 27:41.825
It's a-about a dozen

27:41.828 --> 27:45.008
different high-end tequilas,
for comparison's sake.

27:45.011 --> 27:47.679
And no food for six hours?

27:47.682 --> 27:49.313
Just shots of tequila?

27:49.316 --> 27:50.783
Look, we haven't done anything wrong.

27:50.785 --> 27:51.984
This is show tradition.

27:51.986 --> 27:53.130
Yes, and we're not forcing

27:53.133 --> 27:54.750
the contestants to drink, so please.

27:54.753 --> 27:57.687
Is it part of season 15?

27:57.690 --> 27:59.992
I'm sorry, what?

27:59.994 --> 28:01.560
If you did nothing wrong,

28:01.562 --> 28:04.565
is the tequila buffet part of season 15?

28:06.166 --> 28:07.933
No.

28:07.935 --> 28:09.635
Thank you.

28:09.637 --> 28:12.605
Yeah. Yeah.

28:22.274 --> 28:23.582
Hello?

28:23.584 --> 28:25.117
Diane, it's Jay Dipersia.

28:25.119 --> 28:27.753
- Do you have one second?
- Sure.

28:27.755 --> 28:30.325
Do any of your clients have
offices inside the building?

28:30.328 --> 28:32.124
Our building? Why?

28:32.126 --> 28:35.193
I spoke to the mail room,
but the letter sent to you

28:35.195 --> 28:37.430
came from inside the building.

28:37.432 --> 28:40.766
Um...

28:40.768 --> 28:44.202
Well, there's, um...

28:44.204 --> 28:47.473
a real estate firm...
We did taxes with them.

28:47.475 --> 28:50.976
And, um, yeah, a tech start-up.

28:50.978 --> 28:53.746
The, uh, CEO, Alec Crichton.

28:53.748 --> 28:55.514
We handled his divorce.

28:55.516 --> 28:57.240
Okay, good.

28:57.243 --> 28:59.452
Any issues with either of them?

28:59.454 --> 29:01.787
No, not that I remember.

29:01.789 --> 29:04.116
The divorce, of course, got heated.

29:04.119 --> 29:06.247
Well, he lose custody of his kids?

29:06.250 --> 29:07.626
Yes.

29:07.628 --> 29:10.028
Huh. Okay.

29:10.030 --> 29:13.466
I'll question them. If
anything occurs to you, call me.

29:13.468 --> 29:16.070
Um, yeah. Good-bye.

29:22.459 --> 29:24.792
All right.

29:45.992 --> 29:48.505
President Trump has
defended his decision

29:48.508 --> 29:50.896
to end cost-sharing reduction subsidies

29:50.899 --> 29:53.461
by pointing to stock price gains...

29:53.464 --> 29:55.904
The idea of a... a prequel

29:55.907 --> 29:57.776
just didn't interest me,

29:57.778 --> 30:00.481
until I found another way in.

30:02.049 --> 30:04.650
When you're a detective,
you can do anything.

30:04.652 --> 30:07.357
Grab 'em by the pussy. Anything.

30:07.360 --> 30:08.854
And a lot of people think

30:08.856 --> 30:12.190
it's about Trump. But it's
really about a certain mindset.

30:12.192 --> 30:16.047
New York's a swamp,
and I'm cleaning it up.

30:28.615 --> 30:30.615
This will be the third week

30:30.618 --> 30:33.185
the potbellied pig
occupies the Map Room.

30:33.188 --> 30:35.154
Though the president
insists Petey the Pig

30:35.157 --> 30:37.651
is a welcome distraction,
many critics worry

30:37.654 --> 30:40.271
the animal debases the
office of the presidency.

30:40.274 --> 30:41.587
We want to hear from you.

30:41.589 --> 30:44.217
Should the president keep a
pig in the White House Map Room?

30:44.220 --> 30:45.419
Go online...

30:54.103 --> 30:56.439
Uh, I like her. She just
says what she thinks.

30:56.442 --> 30:58.920
Eh, I know. But do you trust her?

30:58.923 --> 31:00.664
Uh, I don't know. Does that matter?

31:00.667 --> 31:02.600
I'm not gonna marry her.

31:02.603 --> 31:04.911
My God, can you imagine that marriage?

31:04.913 --> 31:06.345
Liz and Boseman?

31:09.540 --> 31:12.225
Ugh. What did they
even see in each other?

31:12.228 --> 31:13.620
I don't know.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.021
Probably danger.

31:15.023 --> 31:17.223
He called me one of
his investigators today.

31:17.225 --> 31:19.092
- Who, Boseman?
- Mm-hmm.

31:19.094 --> 31:21.628
Or as I call him, Adrian.

31:21.630 --> 31:24.998
- Nice.
- I think we're getting closer, he and I.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.933
And by that, I mean
he knows my name now.

31:26.935 --> 31:30.136
I will drink to that.

31:30.138 --> 31:32.606
It's odd that we're in such a good mood,

31:32.608 --> 31:34.791
given that we were almost killed today.

31:34.794 --> 31:36.943
Well, we're the generation
of living dangerously.

31:36.945 --> 31:38.244
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey!

31:38.246 --> 31:39.619
You're still here!

31:39.622 --> 31:40.774
- Drew!
- Drew!

31:40.777 --> 31:42.711
Whoa!

31:42.714 --> 31:44.083
God, you guys are sloshed.

31:44.086 --> 31:45.369
- No!
- No.

31:45.372 --> 31:47.439
We are just really happy to see you.

31:47.442 --> 31:49.009
- Alive?
- Yes!

31:49.012 --> 31:50.491
- Yes!
- Yes!

31:50.493 --> 31:52.072
Here, sit, sit.

31:52.075 --> 31:53.893
These are tall chairs.

31:53.896 --> 31:55.994
Uh, what are you drinking?

31:55.997 --> 31:57.998
- Whiskey sours.
- More than one sour.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.501
Mm. Not a singular sour.

32:00.503 --> 32:02.168
Okay.

32:02.170 --> 32:05.005
- One more?
- All right.

32:05.008 --> 32:07.977
So...

32:09.111 --> 32:11.111
Oh, shit.

32:11.113 --> 32:12.913
What?

32:12.915 --> 32:15.982
I need you to come
with me to the bathroom.

32:15.984 --> 32:17.183
Now?

32:17.185 --> 32:18.852
Yes.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.455
Don't leave.

32:23.592 --> 32:25.528
- Why? Why?
- Come here.

32:27.095 --> 32:29.896
Oh, there's no lock. Here,
just lean against the door.

32:29.898 --> 32:32.232
He's here for you.

32:32.234 --> 32:34.701
- What?
- He's here to see you.

32:34.703 --> 32:37.237
- No!
- Yes. You invited him tonight.

32:37.239 --> 32:39.840
- Yeah, but for... Wait!
- Fuck you!

32:39.842 --> 32:42.776
I invited him for you.
I'm not interested in him.

32:42.778 --> 32:45.111
Yeah, I know. But he doesn't know that.

32:45.113 --> 32:47.770
Okay, well, uh, do I go home?

32:47.773 --> 32:50.506
No. No, I don't want
you to. We're having fun.

32:50.509 --> 32:51.852
Then what do I do?

32:51.854 --> 32:53.587
Hint that you're gay.

32:53.589 --> 32:55.055
What?

32:55.057 --> 32:56.990
- How do I do that?
- I don't know.

32:56.992 --> 32:58.992
- Oh, my God. I am going back to the bar.
- No!

32:58.994 --> 33:00.927
- Out of the way.
- Maia!

33:00.929 --> 33:02.898
Wait!

33:06.602 --> 33:07.801
Hi.

33:07.803 --> 33:10.619
Hey. I ordered you two more.

33:10.622 --> 33:11.821
Two more each?

33:11.824 --> 33:14.559
No. That would be irresponsible.

33:14.562 --> 33:15.676
Ah.

33:15.678 --> 33:17.243
I'm gay.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.912
Oh.

33:20.115 --> 33:22.649
What should I...

33:22.651 --> 33:25.085
say? Uh...

33:25.087 --> 33:26.619
Congratulations.

33:26.622 --> 33:29.022
We're not gay. Not the two of us.

33:29.024 --> 33:31.825
I'm just gay.

33:31.827 --> 33:34.160
Oh!

33:34.162 --> 33:36.362
You're really handsome.

33:36.364 --> 33:38.231
Oh, my...

33:38.233 --> 33:40.361
Okay, I'm gonna go home.

33:40.364 --> 33:41.696
No, no, stay.

33:41.699 --> 33:43.686
- We should all stay.
- Hey.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.524
You guys want something harder?

33:46.527 --> 33:49.594
Yes, I'm offended! I didn't rape her.

33:49.597 --> 33:51.495
- Why don't you tell the truth, Melanie?
- Please,

33:51.497 --> 33:53.197
refrain from addressing my client.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.034
You could always ask
your client to step out.

33:55.037 --> 33:56.455
I want to be here for this.

33:56.458 --> 33:59.017
Okay. Blake, why did you leave season 14

33:59.020 --> 34:01.154
of Chicago Penthouse?

34:01.156 --> 34:03.056
Because she said I assaulted her,

34:03.058 --> 34:04.917
- and then the producers kicked me off.
- Did you have

34:04.919 --> 34:06.814
any sexual contact with Ms. Clark?

34:06.817 --> 34:09.762
Yes, but she was into it.
I swear to God, I am not

34:09.764 --> 34:11.632
the kind of guy who
does something like that.

34:11.634 --> 34:14.034
So the sexual contact was consensual?

34:14.036 --> 34:17.036
Yeah. Melanie asked me
if I wanted a surefire way

34:17.039 --> 34:19.681
to make it to the final
round. I said sure.

34:19.684 --> 34:21.806
I mean, I'm not stupid.
I'm trying to up my brand.

34:21.810 --> 34:22.976
The sex was her idea?

34:22.978 --> 34:24.252
100%.

34:24.255 --> 34:25.687
She knew how to make a spectacle,

34:25.690 --> 34:27.780
and she knew that would
mean more camera time.

34:27.783 --> 34:29.248
You know what pisses me off?

34:29.251 --> 34:30.784
I'm not accusing you, Blake.

34:30.786 --> 34:32.185
I did not do anything wrong.

34:32.187 --> 34:33.719
You were all over me, Melanie.

34:33.722 --> 34:35.054
You pulled me into that hot tub.

34:35.056 --> 34:36.255
It was a drunken hookup.

34:36.257 --> 34:37.697
And I have zero memory of that.

34:37.699 --> 34:40.009
- Well, I do.
- That's the whole point.

34:40.012 --> 34:42.062
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

34:42.063 --> 34:44.931
No, it's all right. Look...

34:44.933 --> 34:46.800
You didn't get me drunk.

34:46.802 --> 34:48.668
You didn't drug me.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.319
You didn't hold me down
and force yourself on me.

34:51.322 --> 34:52.873
And I didn't say no.

34:52.875 --> 34:56.877
But at some point, I lost
the ability to say no.

34:56.879 --> 34:59.145
And your problem is you're so sure

34:59.147 --> 35:02.148
you're not one of those guys
that you fail to realize that,

35:02.150 --> 35:04.272
on that day, in that moment,

35:04.275 --> 35:07.153
you decided to finish what
you thought I had started.

35:07.155 --> 35:09.720
You became one of those guys, Blake.

35:15.955 --> 35:17.831
Yeah, I heard about that.

35:17.833 --> 35:19.766
Jesus. Anthrax.

35:19.768 --> 35:21.702
You guys all right up there?

35:21.704 --> 35:23.369
Yeah. Ricin.

35:23.371 --> 35:24.939
Just a scare.

35:24.942 --> 35:26.874
I understand you're
one of Diane's clients.

35:26.877 --> 35:27.973
Oh, yeah.

35:27.976 --> 35:29.475
That stupid bitch.

35:29.477 --> 35:30.944
- Excuse me?
- Oh.

35:30.946 --> 35:32.295
No, not Diane.

35:32.298 --> 35:33.814
She's a sweetheart.

35:33.816 --> 35:35.736
No, my ex-wife.

35:35.739 --> 35:37.884
She's the reason I needed Diane.

35:37.886 --> 35:41.087
Wow...!

35:41.089 --> 35:42.891
Cool.

35:43.959 --> 35:45.158
What is it?

35:45.160 --> 35:47.760
Oh. I don't know yet, you know?

35:47.763 --> 35:50.447
It's still trying
to... become something.

35:50.450 --> 35:52.766
I don't know what I'm
thinking until I write it down.

35:52.768 --> 35:54.367
This is all your writing?

35:54.369 --> 35:57.070
Yeah. Looks like a
serial killer, doesn't it?

36:00.075 --> 36:02.908
Yep.

36:12.788 --> 36:15.355
Lori Akerman. I was a production manager

36:15.357 --> 36:17.322
- on Chicago Penthouse.
- You were?

36:17.325 --> 36:18.572
And why were you fired?

36:18.575 --> 36:21.103
Because I saw what I thought
was nonconsensual sex,

36:21.106 --> 36:22.806
and I shut down the production.

36:22.809 --> 36:25.431
That seems like a strange
reason to fire you.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.533
Ms. Stevens makes it sound like

36:27.535 --> 36:29.202
the show was just being responsible.

36:29.204 --> 36:31.071
And yet here I am, out of work.

36:31.073 --> 36:33.206
I think there's a misunderstanding here.

36:33.208 --> 36:36.416
- You were not let go because you...
- Ms. Stevens, please.

36:36.419 --> 36:38.420
What did you see that concerned you?

36:38.423 --> 36:41.127
Melanie was in no state of mind

36:41.130 --> 36:43.049
to be making any kind of decisions,

36:43.051 --> 36:44.452
much less sexual ones.

36:44.455 --> 36:45.578
She was barely conscious.

36:45.581 --> 36:47.415
And why didn't you stop it at the time?

36:47.418 --> 36:50.055
I was doing interviews
with other cast members.

36:50.058 --> 36:52.458
I knew Melanie was drunk, but I thought

36:52.460 --> 36:54.447
that she and Blake
had separated by then.

36:54.450 --> 36:55.634
No further questions.

36:55.637 --> 36:57.402
Ms. Akerman, uh,

36:57.405 --> 37:00.491
first of all, I am so sorry
about your unemployed state.

37:00.494 --> 37:01.639
Thank you.

37:01.642 --> 37:02.836
How many prior production

37:02.838 --> 37:04.871
shutdowns have you been involved in?

37:04.873 --> 37:06.141
This was my first.

37:06.144 --> 37:08.373
And prior to, uh, Chicago Penthouse,

37:08.376 --> 37:10.443
you worked on Daytona Beach

37:10.445 --> 37:12.846
and Dorm Room Afterdark?

37:12.848 --> 37:15.587
- Yes.
- So, what happened on Chicago Penthouse

37:15.590 --> 37:17.383
that was worse than those other shows?

37:17.385 --> 37:18.551
I already said.

37:18.553 --> 37:19.920
Non-consensual sex.

37:19.922 --> 37:21.387
I see.

37:21.389 --> 37:24.958
And how did you feel
about Blake Masters taking

37:24.960 --> 37:26.995
a prominent role on the show?

37:28.263 --> 37:29.595
I...

37:29.597 --> 37:31.017
- How did I feel?
- Yes.

37:31.020 --> 37:33.181
Didn't you disapprove of his casting?

37:33.184 --> 37:34.383
No.

37:34.386 --> 37:35.653
There were no African-American

37:35.656 --> 37:36.969
female contestants on the show.

37:36.972 --> 37:38.138
Is that correct?

37:38.140 --> 37:40.140
I am not involved in casting.

37:40.142 --> 37:42.108
You weren't concerned about depicting

37:42.110 --> 37:45.111
- too many interracial relationships?
- No.

37:45.113 --> 37:48.481
Here are some affidavits
from several producers

37:48.483 --> 37:50.383
on Chicago Penthouse

37:50.385 --> 37:52.252
attesting that you
were expressly concerned

37:52.254 --> 37:53.453
about the prevalence

37:53.455 --> 37:55.255
of interracial relationships.

37:55.257 --> 37:56.658
- Objection.
- Really? Why?

37:56.661 --> 37:58.558
- Relevance.
- Actually, my guess is

37:58.560 --> 38:00.593
you're worried this is very relevant.

38:00.595 --> 38:02.634
You're taking me out of context.

38:02.637 --> 38:04.877
I was talking about audience perception.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.824
- I'm not a racist.
- Ma'am, didn't you shut down

38:06.827 --> 38:08.561
the show because Blake was black

38:08.564 --> 38:09.579
and Melanie was white?

38:09.582 --> 38:11.782
- No.
- And this is why you allowed drunken sex

38:11.785 --> 38:14.291
between white cast members
and not interracial.

38:31.659 --> 38:33.326
What's that?

38:33.328 --> 38:34.594
A test.

38:34.596 --> 38:36.129
Find anything?

38:36.131 --> 38:38.164
Not yet. You?

38:38.166 --> 38:40.102
Maybe.

38:42.002 --> 38:44.470
This is the real detective stuff, huh?

38:44.472 --> 38:47.213
Every printer and copy machine
leaves a unique signature

38:47.216 --> 38:49.322
of microdots on every page it prints.

38:49.325 --> 38:51.141
Like, a fingerprint for that printer.

38:51.144 --> 38:53.077
Here's the one on the letter you opened.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.384
Whoa.

38:54.387 --> 38:56.016
Now, these are two printed pages

38:56.019 --> 38:58.152
from Diane's clients in the building.

38:58.155 --> 39:00.686
So we'll see if the letter
came from their printers.

39:00.695 --> 39:04.099
First, the real estate client.

39:08.630 --> 39:10.696
No match.

39:10.698 --> 39:12.367
Now the other one.

39:17.681 --> 39:20.040
Damn.

39:20.042 --> 39:22.375
I thought it would be
the real estate guy.

39:22.377 --> 39:24.344
Maybe he printed it at home.

39:24.346 --> 39:26.170
Or at a copy store.

39:26.173 --> 39:28.450
Or maybe he has more than one printer.

39:30.285 --> 39:32.220
Mm-hmm...

39:35.166 --> 39:37.033
Okay, good luck.

39:46.666 --> 39:48.436
Hey, what are you doing?

39:51.938 --> 39:54.606
There was a third camera.

39:54.609 --> 39:56.158
Look, this is from the next day.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.314
There's a locked-off
camera above the hot tub.

39:58.317 --> 40:00.980
Uh, hello? Why aren't you excited?

40:00.983 --> 40:02.314
I am.

40:02.317 --> 40:03.851
It's from this floor.

40:03.854 --> 40:05.783
- What?
- U-uh, the letter to Diane?

40:05.786 --> 40:07.187
It's not from a client in this building,

40:07.189 --> 40:08.590
it's from this office.

40:10.525 --> 40:12.092
Why can't you let me have my moment?

40:12.094 --> 40:13.428
Why do you have to show me up?

40:15.163 --> 40:16.198
Ugh!

40:20.713 --> 40:23.302
There was a third camera
recording the assault,

40:23.305 --> 40:25.138
- Your Honor...
- Alleged assault, Your Honor.

40:25.141 --> 40:27.497
And the defense has
failed to turn it over.

40:29.814 --> 40:33.850
You know what I don't understand?

40:33.852 --> 40:36.747
What happened to Simon and Veronica?

40:36.750 --> 40:39.471
I-I mean, they were getting so close

40:39.474 --> 40:41.924
during the season, and then, nothing.

40:41.926 --> 40:44.747
I-I mean, uh, does
that ever get explained?

40:44.750 --> 40:47.268
I'm not sure, Your Honor, but
I can ask the producers for you,

40:47.271 --> 40:48.221
if you'd like me to.

40:48.224 --> 40:49.580
A-and Courtney.

40:49.583 --> 40:51.747
I mean, why did she get expelled?

40:51.750 --> 40:53.135
It makes no sense.

40:53.137 --> 40:55.171
- She was the nice one.
- Your Honor,

40:55.173 --> 40:57.273
the missing footage.

40:57.275 --> 40:58.440
Right.

40:58.442 --> 40:59.776
Ms. Stevens?

40:59.778 --> 41:02.011
Where is it?

41:02.013 --> 41:03.345
I'm sorry?

41:03.347 --> 41:05.982
Did I not make my discovery order clear?

41:05.984 --> 41:09.418
Oh, um, right. Uh, the
producers decided against

41:09.420 --> 41:11.553
using the spy cam footage this season,

41:11.555 --> 41:13.055
and they forgot it was even there.

41:13.057 --> 41:16.125
Right. Yeah, that
could happen to anybody.

41:16.127 --> 41:18.153
- Mm-hmm.
- Find them.

41:18.156 --> 41:19.428
Now.

41:19.430 --> 41:20.529
Yes, Your Honor.

41:20.531 --> 41:22.498
Thank you, Your Honor.

41:22.500 --> 41:23.900
Hey.

41:23.902 --> 41:25.872
What's the matter with you?

41:25.875 --> 41:29.270
I just ruled in your favor.
Don't I even get a smile?

41:29.273 --> 41:31.540
Excuse me, Your Honor?

41:31.542 --> 41:33.009
I mean...

41:33.011 --> 41:34.543
you should smile more.

41:34.545 --> 41:36.913
Yeah, I don't-I don't
know when it happened,

41:36.915 --> 41:38.950
that women stopped smiling.

41:46.730 --> 41:48.596
What? What is this?

41:48.599 --> 41:49.900
What-what is it?

41:49.903 --> 41:51.994
What is she doing?

41:51.996 --> 41:54.325
Uh, your co-counsel is laughing.

41:54.328 --> 41:56.098
Is... am I missing something here?

41:56.100 --> 41:57.934
No, Your Honor.

41:57.936 --> 42:01.603
- We've been stretched really thin, recently.
- Oh, right.

42:01.605 --> 42:04.355
I heard about that
whole baking soda scare.

42:04.358 --> 42:06.842
Diane. Diane, Diane. Yeah, thank you.

42:06.845 --> 42:08.310
Thank you, Your Honor.

42:08.312 --> 42:09.545
I-Is she all right?

42:09.547 --> 42:12.271
She's just pleasantly
surprised, Your Honor.

42:20.591 --> 42:23.222
Uh, are you okay?

42:23.225 --> 42:24.560
Am I?

42:24.562 --> 42:26.095
Yes. Why?

42:26.097 --> 42:27.753
You were laughing in there.

42:27.756 --> 42:30.366
Yes, the judge was funny.

42:30.368 --> 42:33.469
Oh, God.

42:37.008 --> 42:39.208
Are you still microdosing?

42:39.210 --> 42:40.542
Nope.

42:40.544 --> 42:42.544
This is what I'm like when I'm not.

42:42.546 --> 42:44.213
Are you sure?

42:44.215 --> 42:47.309
Listen, did the president
put a potbellied pig

42:47.312 --> 42:49.167
in the White House Map Room?

42:49.170 --> 42:51.153
Uh, excuse me?

42:51.155 --> 42:53.122
No, was there a story today

42:53.124 --> 42:57.960
about Trump adopting a pig named Petey,

42:57.962 --> 43:00.997
and keeping him in the White House?

43:00.999 --> 43:05.567
I... No.

43:05.569 --> 43:08.304
You're looking at me like that's insane.

43:14.578 --> 43:15.975
Hi.

43:16.080 --> 43:17.914
Hi.

43:17.916 --> 43:20.116
You wanted to talk to me?

43:20.118 --> 43:22.351
Yes. Uh...

43:22.353 --> 43:26.834
so our Wi-Fi keeps track of
when people in the firm log out.

43:26.837 --> 43:28.003
We're all in the same server.

43:28.006 --> 43:29.691
- Did you know that?
- No.

43:29.693 --> 43:33.229
See, that's your I.D. number.

43:33.231 --> 43:34.463
Okay.

43:34.465 --> 43:36.795
It shows, at 10:23 a.m. yesterday,

43:36.798 --> 43:38.331
you were the very last one to log out.

43:38.334 --> 43:39.648
Yeah. Makes sense.

43:39.651 --> 43:41.651
We're behind on the Lanthimos brief,

43:41.654 --> 43:44.740
and I've been working through
lunch, and pretty late.

43:44.743 --> 43:47.076
Right, but you see,
everyone else logged out

43:47.078 --> 43:48.945
because, of course, there
was a chemical scare,

43:48.947 --> 43:50.546
and we all left the building.

43:50.548 --> 43:53.415
Well, I guess I forgot to log out.

43:53.417 --> 43:56.552
No, you're logged out automatically.

43:56.554 --> 43:58.720
Uh, you just stayed later than everyone.

43:58.722 --> 44:00.675
Well, like I said,

44:00.678 --> 44:03.025
I've-I've been pretty behind.

44:03.027 --> 44:05.027
Mm.

44:05.029 --> 44:07.063
Why weren't you afraid of the ricin?

44:07.065 --> 44:09.698
It turns out, it wasn't ricin.

44:09.700 --> 44:11.067
Right.

44:11.076 --> 44:14.076
But no one knew that.

44:17.175 --> 44:19.508
You sent the letter
to Diane, didn't you?

44:19.510 --> 44:21.534
I-I don't know what you're...

44:21.537 --> 44:22.636
Here's the thing.

44:22.639 --> 44:24.080
You're going to jail.

44:24.082 --> 44:25.659
No, I...

44:25.662 --> 44:27.483
Yes.

44:27.485 --> 44:31.687
Unless you go apologize to Diane.

44:31.689 --> 44:33.545
Tell me why you did it.

44:38.997 --> 44:41.530
There's been so much work.

44:41.532 --> 44:44.400
And...

44:44.402 --> 44:46.102
they wanted the brief in on Friday,

44:46.104 --> 44:48.170
and I can't get it in on time.

44:48.172 --> 44:52.295
I... I was so afraid of being
fired, I just wanted a day.

44:54.078 --> 44:55.744
Okay.

44:55.982 --> 44:57.681
Okay.

45:00.751 --> 45:02.751
Okay.

45:02.753 --> 45:07.325
Uh, I-I just need you to sign something.

45:28.746 --> 45:30.646
- That was cold.
- What?

45:30.648 --> 45:32.777
Telling him to sign or you'd
turn him over to the cops,

45:32.779 --> 45:34.383
then, you turned him over to the cops.

45:34.385 --> 45:35.684
I don't work for him.

45:35.686 --> 45:37.436
I work for the firm.

46:06.183 --> 46:07.495
Well...

46:07.498 --> 46:09.118
what am I looking for?

46:09.120 --> 46:11.589
Shh.

46:19.197 --> 46:21.217
She passed out.

46:37.781 --> 46:39.715
Oh, I think you're gonna want to...

46:39.717 --> 46:42.417
want to watch this part, Ms. Stevens.

46:42.420 --> 46:43.573
Yeah.

46:43.576 --> 46:45.787
- Andrea.
- Mm-hmm.

46:45.789 --> 46:47.623
♪ Happy birthday,
it's your birthday... ♪

46:47.625 --> 46:52.998
And here's where it gets exciting.

46:53.001 --> 46:55.318
♪ Birthday, now,
whose birthday is it? ♪

47:03.574 --> 47:04.987
Take it or leave it.

47:04.990 --> 47:07.373
I'm not authorized to go any higher.

47:22.926 --> 47:28.584
_

47:46.173 --> 47:48.250
$3.2 million.

47:53.791 --> 47:55.624
Mm.

47:55.626 --> 47:56.858
All right.

47:56.860 --> 47:59.261
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Did you hear?

47:59.263 --> 48:00.929
What? Trump is keeping a potbellied pig

48:00.931 --> 48:02.333
in the White House?

48:03.567 --> 48:05.367
No, Diane.

48:05.369 --> 48:07.037
Dipersia, he caught the fellow

48:07.040 --> 48:08.704
who sent you that threatening letter.

48:08.706 --> 48:09.938
Who?

48:09.940 --> 48:11.273
One of our associates here.

48:11.275 --> 48:12.941
Wanted more time to write his brief.

48:16.247 --> 48:18.980
No.

48:18.982 --> 48:21.783
His brief...

48:21.785 --> 48:23.852
Diane.

48:23.854 --> 48:25.587
You all right?

48:25.589 --> 48:29.458
Look, look, um...

48:29.460 --> 48:32.228
I know the last few
weeks have been hard.

48:32.230 --> 48:34.696
But are you really serious
about leaving the law?

48:34.698 --> 48:36.432
Am I what?

48:36.434 --> 48:39.401
Serious about leaving the law.

48:39.403 --> 48:41.970
Liz said you've been
having some difficulty

48:41.972 --> 48:43.672
with Carl's death, and...

48:43.674 --> 48:45.974
these copycat killings.

48:45.976 --> 48:48.910
Really?

48:48.912 --> 48:51.313
No, I'm good.

48:51.315 --> 48:53.382
Good.

48:53.384 --> 48:55.920
We can't afford to lose you, too.

48:55.923 --> 49:00.002
Adrian, these last few weeks, it
felt like death was everywhere.

49:00.005 --> 49:01.237
That's all.

49:01.240 --> 49:03.425
But now...

49:03.427 --> 49:05.294
You're seeing life again.

49:05.296 --> 49:08.198
No. I just don't care.

49:09.799 --> 49:11.799
What did Tennessee Williams say?

49:11.802 --> 49:14.803
"What is the secret to happiness?

49:14.805 --> 49:17.506
Insensitivity."

49:17.508 --> 49:19.343
That's what I feel.

49:22.780 --> 49:24.815
Well, good job, anyway.

49:28.520 --> 49:31.443
We are $600,000 richer.

49:31.446 --> 49:33.854
And with Trump, we
won't be taxed as much.

49:37.695 --> 49:40.339
I think we should have a
party for the new offices.

49:40.342 --> 49:43.193
Introduce ourselves
to the community again.

49:43.196 --> 49:44.599
That sounds terrific.

49:44.602 --> 49:45.634
Good.

49:45.636 --> 49:47.305
Let's do it.

50:16.568 --> 50:18.198
Hey.

50:18.200 --> 50:19.236
Hey.

50:19.239 --> 50:20.369
How's everything?

50:20.371 --> 50:21.403
Good.

50:21.405 --> 50:23.472
And fuck you.
