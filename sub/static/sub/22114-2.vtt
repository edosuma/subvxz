00:08.069 --> 00:10.069
( theme music playing )

00:23.819 --> 00:25.444
( pounding on door )

00:29.194 --> 00:30.653
Leon:
Larry, it's Leon!

00:34.527 --> 00:35.778
( lock clicks )

00:37.486 --> 00:38.778
The fuck?

00:40.653 --> 00:43.402
Leon:
What's going on, man?

00:43.402 --> 00:45.903
It's fucking crazy
in this fucking room.

00:45.903 --> 00:48.736
What are these
motherfucking shades, man?

00:48.736 --> 00:50.944
Oh, my God.

00:50.944 --> 00:53.110
You need sunlight, man.
You turning white.

00:53.110 --> 00:56.694
- The fuck is going on?
- What are you doing?

00:56.694 --> 00:58.944
What?
I'm in a hotel.

00:58.944 --> 01:00.486
You think you're safe
in a hotel?

01:00.486 --> 01:01.819
I think I'm safer here
than in my house.

01:01.819 --> 01:02.944
The bottom line
is this, Larry--

01:02.944 --> 01:04.569
you can't
fucking hide here.

01:04.569 --> 01:06.653
These motherfuckers want you,
they're gonna come and get you.

01:06.653 --> 01:08.653
Cut your fucking hands off,
cut your feet off,

01:08.653 --> 01:09.861
put your feet
in your back pockets,

01:09.861 --> 01:11.152
put your hands
in your front pockets,

01:11.152 --> 01:12.444
and then carry
your ass out of here

01:12.444 --> 01:13.611
like a piece
of fucking luggage.

01:13.611 --> 01:14.985
Jeff:
How are you helping?

01:14.985 --> 01:16.361
I'm just letting him
know what happens.

01:16.361 --> 01:17.653
You don't need
this shit.

01:17.653 --> 01:19.027
You go to your house.
No one's coming.

01:19.027 --> 01:21.819
I talked to the FBI guy.
He's not gonna lie.

01:21.819 --> 01:23.152
No one is coming.

01:23.152 --> 01:25.861
But I can't go back
to the house.

01:25.861 --> 01:28.319
I gotta move
or sell the house
or something.

01:28.319 --> 01:30.611
No, no, no, no.
You can't fucking
sell the house.

01:30.611 --> 01:32.235
All of my ladies know
I live there already.

01:32.235 --> 01:33.861
You're gonna set me back
two or three years.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.985
No, fucking stay there.
You fucking stay.

01:35.985 --> 01:40.653
Get back to your life.
Get back on the horse now!

01:40.653 --> 01:42.694
- Okay, give me two minutes.
- Jeff: Yeah.

01:43.985 --> 01:45.653
- Proud of ya.
- My man.

01:57.944 --> 01:59.361
( door opens )

02:00.903 --> 02:02.319
( door closes )

02:10.069 --> 02:11.736
Ah.

02:11.736 --> 02:14.027
( scoffs )
I was there first.
I should've got that.

02:14.027 --> 02:16.861
I was too busy
looking in the mirror
'cause I'm so vain.

02:16.861 --> 02:18.861
It's no big deal.
I got it.

02:18.861 --> 02:20.361
Thank you,
thank you.

02:20.361 --> 02:22.444
Well, look at you.

02:22.444 --> 02:24.527
Look at me.

02:24.527 --> 02:25.903
May I ask you
a question?

02:27.069 --> 02:29.944
- Sure.
- Why this outfit?

02:29.944 --> 02:32.778
It seems that women
in your profession,

02:32.778 --> 02:34.903
they-- they dress like this
for some reason.

02:34.903 --> 02:37.778
Why not look wholesome?
Why double down on
the seediness?

02:37.778 --> 02:39.736
I think I look
really good.

02:39.736 --> 02:41.402
- Mm. Mm.
- No?

02:41.402 --> 02:43.402
- ( sighs )
- Mm, I mean,
look at dentists.

02:43.402 --> 02:45.653
They don't walk around
with their smocks on

02:45.653 --> 02:47.736
when they're not in--
when they're not in
their office.

02:47.736 --> 02:50.778
- This is a hooker smock
is what you got on.
- I'm a hooker.

02:50.778 --> 02:53.069
I know, but you don't
have to show everybody.

02:53.069 --> 02:55.611
- I don't?
- No! People like a mystery.

02:55.611 --> 03:00.110
Imagine putting on
a beautiful dress from
Saks Fifth Avenue, you know?

03:00.110 --> 03:03.069
All right, well, first of all,
I'm-- I'm not able to afford

03:03.069 --> 03:06.194
a dress from
Saks Fifth Avenue,
so that's not gonna happen.

03:06.194 --> 03:08.069
You're not able
to afford it now,

03:08.069 --> 03:12.277
but get one dress
and I guarantee you
in six months,

03:12.277 --> 03:16.778
your closet will be packed
with dresses like that.

03:16.778 --> 03:18.319
Really?

03:18.319 --> 03:20.194
- Absolutely.
- ( elevator dings )

03:20.194 --> 03:22.527
Okay, so I'm gonna
put the tits away.

03:22.527 --> 03:23.985
Yeah, put--
put the tits away.

03:23.985 --> 03:25.235
- Animal prints gone.
- Yeah.

03:25.235 --> 03:27.110
- No more hooker boots.
- None. Zero.

03:27.110 --> 03:29.277
- Fishnets,
out of here.
- Out.

03:29.277 --> 03:32.027
- I think I could do this.
- I think business
is gonna boom.

03:32.027 --> 03:34.027
- I really do.
- Thank you so much.

03:34.027 --> 03:36.110
- Oh, well...
- Oh.

03:36.110 --> 03:39.694
I-- I'm so thrilled
about this whole thing.
Good luck!

03:39.694 --> 03:41.444
Good luck!
You can do it!

03:41.444 --> 03:43.527
- Larry: Hi.
- Hi.

03:43.527 --> 03:46.569
I'm checking out
a lot earlier than
I had anticipated.

03:46.569 --> 03:48.985
- Oh, we hate
to see you go.
- Okay, 1003.

03:48.985 --> 03:51.778
1003. And what is
the name on 1003?

03:51.778 --> 03:53.611
Buck Dancer.

03:55.486 --> 03:58.402
Uh, okay, Mr. Dancer,
let me just bring that up.

03:58.402 --> 04:01.903
- I hope you enjoyed your stay.
- Mm, yeah, yeah, it was fine.
It was fine.

04:01.903 --> 04:03.569
Okay, well, be sure
to visit our website.

04:03.569 --> 04:05.819
You can always
give us some feedback.
We love notes.

04:05.819 --> 04:07.486
- Don't tuck in.
- The sheets?

04:07.486 --> 04:09.027
- Don't tuck in?
- Yeah, don't-- don't tuck in.

04:09.027 --> 04:10.861
- Too tight for you?
- Who sleeps like that?

04:10.861 --> 04:12.486
It's suffocating.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.611
- You're right.
- It's absolutely suffocating.

04:14.611 --> 04:16.903
Don't tuck.
I will take that note
on advisement.

04:16.903 --> 04:19.277
Those cookies,
those are for guests?

04:19.277 --> 04:21.194
Oh, absolutely, yes.
We have a wonderful
pastry chef.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.778
- Let me know
if you need a box.
- Thank you.

04:22.778 --> 04:23.653
( chuckles )

04:37.861 --> 04:41.152
Ah, I see you went
for the big ones,
Mr. Dancer, right?

04:41.152 --> 04:45.194
- Yes, yes, I got the first.
- Oh, good, good for you.
They're delicious.

04:45.194 --> 04:46.903
Uh, just, if I may,

04:46.903 --> 04:50.694
we ask that
people use the tongs
when selecting their cookies.

04:50.694 --> 04:53.235
Tongs? Yes, yes,
I saw the tongs there.

04:53.235 --> 04:55.736
I eschewed the tongs
deliberately

04:55.736 --> 04:58.819
because the tongs are not
made for picking up cookies.

04:58.819 --> 05:00.736
They-- they crumble
the cookie.

05:00.736 --> 05:02.527
It's not a good system,
the tong.

05:02.527 --> 05:05.319
Uh, we just ask, you know,
that you use the tongs,

05:05.319 --> 05:06.778
which we sort of
provide there on the plate,

05:06.778 --> 05:08.319
you know, just for
sanitary reasons.

05:08.319 --> 05:09.861
Here, look,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

05:09.861 --> 05:11.861
I'll take my second cookie
with the tongs...

05:11.861 --> 05:13.694
- Thank you.
- ...all right?

05:13.694 --> 05:15.736
- Perfect. Great.
- ( grunting )

05:17.694 --> 05:19.569
- ( exhales )
- Seem to be making
a moment of it,

05:19.569 --> 05:21.235
- but I'll let you have it.
- I wasn't making a moment.

05:21.235 --> 05:22.903
It's just it's hard
to hold it.

05:22.903 --> 05:25.235
Let me ask you
this question--

05:25.235 --> 05:26.569
who put you in charge
of the cookies?

05:26.569 --> 05:27.694
Do you oversee
the cookies?

05:27.694 --> 05:29.194
I was given
explicit instructions

05:29.194 --> 05:31.611
to look over the lobby,
which is my jurisdiction.

05:31.611 --> 05:33.527
So, yes, I oversee
the cookies.

05:33.527 --> 05:37.069
Okay, I-- I don't think
this is within your
jurisdiction.

05:37.069 --> 05:38.778
Well, uh, Mr. Dancer,

05:38.778 --> 05:42.027
I have enjoyed spending
so much time with you,

05:42.027 --> 05:44.277
and thank you for
all your wonderful notes,

05:44.277 --> 05:47.194
and, uh, we hope
to see you again.

05:47.194 --> 05:49.569
You say the pastry chef
made these?

05:49.569 --> 05:51.569
Oh, yes.
They're wonderful.

05:51.569 --> 05:53.402
I got news
for you, pal.

05:53.402 --> 05:54.985
This is
a Pepperidge Farm cookie.

05:54.985 --> 05:56.444
- Okay?
- I...

05:56.444 --> 05:57.985
This is a Pepperidge Farm
cookie, that's it.

05:57.985 --> 05:59.110
Well, I will go
to that pastry chef

05:59.110 --> 06:00.361
and I will
confront him about it.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.694
Don't tell people
these are

06:01.694 --> 06:02.944
home-made cookies
by a pastry chef.

06:02.944 --> 06:05.152
- Okay, no, I--
- Okay.

06:05.152 --> 06:07.194
- I wouldn't and I didn't.
- This is a Pepperidge Farm
cookie.

06:07.194 --> 06:08.944
I don't believe those are
Pepperidge Farm cookies.

06:08.944 --> 06:10.110
This is
a Pepperidge Farm cookie.

06:10.110 --> 06:11.319
All right,
Mr. Dancer, well,

06:11.319 --> 06:13.319
I will take that
into account--

06:13.319 --> 06:15.611
I'm a little disappointed.
I could buy this in
the grocery store

06:15.611 --> 06:17.611
on my way home, so.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.569
- Okay.
- But anyway, you're
putting out Pepperidge Farm.

06:19.569 --> 06:21.486
- Fine, great, okay.
- Okay, great.
Thank you so much.

06:21.486 --> 06:26.235
Linda, can we get
these cookies out of the way
that he touched?

06:30.194 --> 06:32.444
I don't want you to use
these doors anymore.
You got that?

06:32.444 --> 06:35.110
- They call
this shit "overreacting."
- Is the alarm working?

06:36.444 --> 06:38.444
You should worry about
that goddamn fireplace.

06:38.444 --> 06:40.277
You're gonna
fuck around and forget,

06:40.277 --> 06:43.277
and Fatwa Claus gonna come down
that fucking chimney
and kill your ass.

06:43.277 --> 06:44.903
What is this shit?
What are you eating?

06:44.903 --> 06:46.903
- Beef sticks.
- Beef stick?

06:46.903 --> 06:48.277
You know how bad
that is for you?

06:48.277 --> 06:49.653
Have you ever read
the ingredients?

06:49.653 --> 06:51.444
Have you ever tried
one of these motherfuckers?

06:51.444 --> 06:52.985
- They're fucking delicious.
- They're disgusting.

06:52.985 --> 06:54.486
Look, beef, of course,

06:54.486 --> 06:57.277
molasses, wheat,
brown sugar.

06:57.277 --> 06:59.319
Brown fucking sugar.
I love fucking brown sugar.

06:59.319 --> 07:02.611
You think black people prefer
brown sugar over white sugar?

07:02.611 --> 07:05.653
Absolutely.
Anything brown
over fucking white.

07:05.653 --> 07:07.527
- Pants?
- Of fucking course.

07:07.527 --> 07:08.778
( knocking on door )

07:08.778 --> 07:10.861
Fuck. Okay,
get the door.

07:10.861 --> 07:14.069
- Give me this thing.
- Don't you-- don't you
bitch up.

07:14.069 --> 07:16.319
Ask who it is.
Don't forget.

07:16.319 --> 07:18.611
- ( knocking continues )
- I'll answer the door.

07:21.069 --> 07:22.985
- Funkhouser.
- Oh.

07:22.985 --> 07:25.194
- Hi. Kenny.
- What's up, Kenny?

07:25.194 --> 07:26.694
- Hi, Leon.
How you doing?
- Hey, man.

07:26.694 --> 07:28.361
Hey, Funk-man.

07:28.361 --> 07:30.444
Funkhouser:
LD, come down here.

07:30.444 --> 07:33.027
- To what do I owe the honor?
- My nephew, Kenny.

07:33.027 --> 07:35.027
- Kenny, hi. Larry. Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you.

07:35.027 --> 07:38.361
- The jewel of
the Funkhouser family tree.
- Is that so?

07:38.361 --> 07:40.653
- That is so.
- Huh, how about that.

07:40.653 --> 07:43.402
- Straight-A student, okay?
- Mm.

07:43.402 --> 07:45.611
Member of six clubs
in high school--

07:45.611 --> 07:46.944
runs them all.

07:46.944 --> 07:51.027
He was just voted high school
All-American pitcher.

07:51.027 --> 07:52.361
- All right.
- One-of-a-kind.

07:52.361 --> 07:54.069
- Okay. Yeah.
- Now, wait a minute!

07:54.069 --> 07:56.527
If he nails his SATs,
which he will...

07:56.527 --> 07:59.985
- Mm-hmm.
- ...he's going to Stanford
on a full scholarship.

07:59.985 --> 08:03.319
I don't wanna be a hater,
but can't nobody do all
that shit in one day.

08:03.319 --> 08:05.861
Well, I mean,
I just work hard and--

08:05.861 --> 08:08.861
I'm saying you're making it
feel like this motherfucker's
Forrest Gump or something.

08:08.861 --> 08:11.694
- You ever see that movie?
- Yeah, I've seen
"Forrest Gump."

08:11.694 --> 08:13.319
That motherfucker
lived a life.

08:13.319 --> 08:15.861
I mean, I'm not-- I'm not
running across the country.

08:15.861 --> 08:18.361
- You ever see a titty?
- Larry: What's the matter
with you?

08:18.361 --> 08:19.736
What kind of
a question is that?

08:19.736 --> 08:22.527
Anyway, so, uh,
thanks for stopping by.

08:22.527 --> 08:24.235
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

08:24.235 --> 08:27.027
We-- we were just about to eat,
so I'll see you, uh...

08:27.027 --> 08:29.402
- I'd love a sandwich.
- Kenny: Me, too.

08:29.402 --> 08:31.361
- I'm starved.
- I don't wanna
impose, though.

08:31.361 --> 08:33.778
We got a lot of meats, man.
All kind of shits
in that fridge.

08:33.778 --> 08:35.027
- Funkhouser: Let's do it.
- Kenny: Yeah!

08:35.027 --> 08:36.486
- Come on.
- Oh, thank you.

08:36.486 --> 08:38.653
- ( clears throat )
- You like bologna and shit?

08:38.653 --> 08:40.402
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- You couldn't--

08:40.402 --> 08:42.235
- let me tell you something.
- This kid's a pitcher?

08:42.235 --> 08:43.444
Let's get off that.

08:43.444 --> 08:44.903
Looks like he can't
lift a chess piece.

08:44.903 --> 08:46.694
Yeah, you'd have
a good time hitting him.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.277
Here, try that mustard.
It's dope.

08:49.277 --> 08:51.194
Leon:
Larry has all kind
of goodies in here.

08:51.194 --> 08:53.486
All kind of cheeses
and meats.

08:53.486 --> 08:55.444
- What are you making?
- Sandwiches, baby.

08:55.444 --> 08:58.611
- Who wants a pickle?
- Pickles! I want pickles.

08:58.611 --> 09:00.653
- You can't have a sandwich
without pickles, right?
- No!

09:02.402 --> 09:04.194
- Funkhouser:
Tap it, tap it.
- Yeah.

09:04.194 --> 09:06.361
Do you need any help?
I got it, I got it.

09:06.361 --> 09:08.778
Everybody's gotta be
the hero with a pickle jar.

09:08.778 --> 09:10.277
Everybody
wants to open it.

09:10.277 --> 09:12.611
You just gotta
hit it up.

09:12.611 --> 09:15.985
- Here, give it to the big Funk.
- No, little Funk's got it,
okay?

09:15.985 --> 09:17.903
- Come on, let me take
a shot at it.
- No.

09:17.903 --> 09:19.444
- What are you doing, Kenny?
- No, I got it!

09:19.444 --> 09:21.444
- Kenny, give me the jar!
- I got it. Ooh! Oh!

09:21.444 --> 09:23.277
- Leon: Shit.
- What happened?

09:23.277 --> 09:25.319
- I think I heard it crack.
- Your pitching arm?

09:25.319 --> 09:26.985
- Yeah, that's
my pitching arm.
- Oh, my God.

09:26.985 --> 09:29.069
- We gotta go to the hospital.
- ( cries )

09:29.069 --> 09:31.361
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
- Oh, shut up.

09:31.361 --> 09:34.569
- It was an accident!
- I never should've brought him
over here!

09:34.569 --> 09:36.985
He tried to open the pickles,
so he took the jar from him,

09:36.985 --> 09:40.486
- and you tried to
get it from him, too!
- You're trying to do too much.

09:40.486 --> 09:42.361
Valedictorian,
now you wanna be
pickle boy.

09:42.361 --> 09:44.527
- You're doing too much!
- Sorry!

09:48.527 --> 09:51.319
You know, I think
we have a half open jar
in the fridge.

09:56.277 --> 09:57.569
- ( scoffs )
- What do you know?

09:57.569 --> 09:58.694
What do you know?

09:58.694 --> 10:01.569
( chatter on TV )

10:01.569 --> 10:03.152
Oh, darling,
you're cold. Here.

10:03.152 --> 10:04.861
- Here, put this around you.
- I'm just excited.

10:07.527 --> 10:09.694
( door opens )

10:09.694 --> 10:12.402
Roger:
Well, that's what
they want me to do.

10:12.402 --> 10:14.736
- I've got a ticket here...
- What's up, Larry?

10:14.736 --> 10:16.903
- Yeah.
- ( sighs )

10:16.903 --> 10:19.569
I had a horrible night
last night.

10:19.569 --> 10:21.110
Horrible.

10:21.110 --> 10:23.194
I couldn't sleep,
was up all night.

10:23.194 --> 10:26.027
I heard-- I heard
someone at the gate.

10:26.027 --> 10:31.235
( stammering )
I heard voices and somebody
creeping around the house.

10:31.235 --> 10:33.194
It, like,
freaked me out.

10:33.194 --> 10:35.527
Well, you know what?
There was a lot of shit
going on last night.

10:35.527 --> 10:37.235
I had a little
lady friend come over.

10:37.235 --> 10:40.110
You know, her girlfriend's
waiting outside in the car,

10:40.110 --> 10:42.944
the kid's in the back seat,
jumping around and shit.

10:42.944 --> 10:44.694
- You know?
- ( sighs )

10:44.694 --> 10:46.611
And then I had
the pizza guy come over.
He came over--

10:46.611 --> 10:49.611
Okay, so-- so it was you.
So you kept me up,
essentially.

10:49.611 --> 10:52.194
I didn't keep you up.
Just some normal shit
that I do.

10:52.194 --> 10:55.736
I need some--
I need some security
in the house.

10:55.736 --> 10:58.944
You know, like a--
I gotta hire, like,
a Pinkerton guard or something.

10:58.944 --> 11:00.903
You don't need
no Pinkerton guard.

11:00.903 --> 11:02.944
You know what?
I'll tell you what.

11:02.944 --> 11:05.319
- Let me handle this shit.
- You're-- you're gonna
hire somebody?

11:05.319 --> 11:07.402
- What are you gonna do?
- What if I get somebody
half the price

11:07.402 --> 11:09.402
of that Pinkerton
motherfucker?

11:09.402 --> 11:12.235
I'm gonna take care
of all this security shit
you're worried about, okay?

11:12.235 --> 11:15.069
I'm gonna get you--
get you back to
being Larry.

11:15.069 --> 11:18.361
Sitting around here,
looking all frumpy
and shit.

11:18.361 --> 11:20.736
Well, no, the only reason
I'm wearing this bathrobe

11:20.736 --> 11:22.819
is because I left
my pajama bottoms--

11:22.819 --> 11:24.277
you know, those
red flannel pajamas?

11:24.277 --> 11:26.277
- Right.
- I left them
at the hotel.

11:26.277 --> 11:28.611
I can't leave a hotel room
without leaving something
behind.

11:28.611 --> 11:30.653
- Never fails.
- ( doorbell rings )

11:30.653 --> 11:33.152
- Oh.
- Are you expecting
somebody?

11:33.152 --> 11:34.653
I'm always
expecting somebody.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.736
If they show the fuck up,
they show the fuck up.

11:36.736 --> 11:39.152
Goodbye, darling.

11:39.152 --> 11:41.277
- Excuse me a minute.
- He's all right, you know.

11:41.277 --> 11:43.611
- He's gonna be all right.
- Hey!

11:43.611 --> 11:45.444
- He's alive!
- Larry: Oh!

11:45.444 --> 11:47.194
- Hey, buddy.
- How you doing?

11:47.194 --> 11:48.819
I'm all right.
How are you doing?

11:48.819 --> 11:51.277
Oh, God,
I'm a mess.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.444
- Yeah, so bad.
- I'd be terrified.

11:53.444 --> 11:55.694
Yeah, and the worst part
is the musical's off.

11:55.694 --> 11:57.527
- Oh, you're kidding me.
- No.

11:57.527 --> 11:59.444
It was
such a funny idea.

11:59.444 --> 12:01.444
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

12:01.444 --> 12:03.653
- Um...
- Nice of you
to come over, though,

12:03.653 --> 12:05.277
and, uh, say hi.

12:05.277 --> 12:07.152
- That's really
sweet of you.
- No.

12:07.152 --> 12:08.778
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

12:08.778 --> 12:09.903
Yeah,
you're welcome.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.778
Um, actually,
you know what?

12:12.778 --> 12:14.152
( sighs )

12:14.152 --> 12:16.778
All right,
I'm full of shit.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.152
The truth is
I'm here to ask--

12:19.152 --> 12:22.486
I'm here to ask
your permission
if I can date Cheryl.

12:23.778 --> 12:25.819
Boom.
( clears throat )

12:25.819 --> 12:27.277
( scoffs )

12:27.277 --> 12:29.152
- Wow.
- Wow?

12:29.152 --> 12:32.277
Yeah, you come over here
under these false pretenses

12:32.277 --> 12:34.653
to, oh--
to see how I'm doing,

12:34.653 --> 12:37.486
and-- and you
wanna date-- no!

12:37.486 --> 12:39.110
No, I-- no, no, I--

12:39.110 --> 12:42.319
if you're asking me
can you date Cheryl,
I'd say no.

12:42.319 --> 12:44.152
Let-- let's just
step back just a second.

12:44.152 --> 12:46.277
This is a surprise
to me, too.

12:46.277 --> 12:49.361
We're friends.
I didn't wanna sneak
around behind your back.

12:49.361 --> 12:52.985
( stammering )
I need to, like--
to go with my impulses,

12:52.985 --> 12:56.819
and my impulse is
I wanna-- I wanna go out
with your ex-wife.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.778
How would you like it
if I went out with Mary, huh?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.319
- Would you like that?
- Don't be stupid.

13:00.319 --> 13:01.653
( scoffs )
What does that mean?

13:01.653 --> 13:03.486
It means you're--

13:03.486 --> 13:07.653
you wanna call my ex-wife,
Mary Steenburgen--

13:07.653 --> 13:11.486
- Larry David wants to ask
Mary Steenburgen out?
- Oh.

13:11.486 --> 13:15.778
Oh, Larry David
is not cool enough
for Mary Steenburgen?

13:15.778 --> 13:18.819
- I-- I just--
- Huh? But Ted Danson is?
Is that it?

13:18.819 --> 13:22.194
I didn't say that,
but there's something
in there.

13:22.194 --> 13:23.861
- ( overlapping voices )
- Oh, okay, all right.

13:23.861 --> 13:25.778
You know what?
I'll call her right now.
How's that?

13:25.778 --> 13:27.653
How's that?
I'll call Mary.

13:27.653 --> 13:29.444
- Fine.
- Okay? Okay?

13:29.444 --> 13:31.152
You want me to?

13:31.152 --> 13:32.611
- Do it.
- Okay.

13:32.611 --> 13:35.361
But then can we get back
to this real subject?

13:37.194 --> 13:38.819
Mary!

13:38.819 --> 13:41.319
- I can't believe it.
- Hey, it's Larry David.

13:41.319 --> 13:43.152
- Hi, Larry!
- Hey!

13:43.152 --> 13:44.903
- How you doing?
- Good, good.

13:44.903 --> 13:47.861
Hey, Mar, um, let--
let me ask you something.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.736
You know what's going on
with Ted and Cheryl?

13:50.736 --> 13:54.611
Ted told me he was
interested in seeing her

13:54.611 --> 13:56.611
and I told him
to go for it.

13:56.611 --> 13:59.361
Well, um...
( clears throat )

13:59.361 --> 14:01.736
I was kind of
wondering...

14:01.736 --> 14:03.319
( scoffs )

14:03.319 --> 14:05.985
...you know, if he's gonna
go out with her,

14:05.985 --> 14:09.402
why, uh-- why don't
you go out with me?

14:09.402 --> 14:11.361
( chuckles )

14:11.361 --> 14:13.569
Wow, Lar.

14:13.569 --> 14:15.235
Oh, my gosh.

14:15.235 --> 14:18.110
( stammering )
Um, I just--

14:18.110 --> 14:20.069
God, I love you so much.

14:20.069 --> 14:24.611
I don't know
if we have anything in common
that way, you know?

14:24.611 --> 14:26.277
- Do you think?
- Well, we're both people.

14:26.277 --> 14:28.611
We're Earthlings,
we breathe, we eat,

14:28.611 --> 14:30.611
so we have--
we have that in common.

14:30.611 --> 14:33.569
Yeah, we have that in common
with pretty much everybody,

14:33.569 --> 14:36.527
but I was--
I was just meaning,
like, you know,

14:36.527 --> 14:39.985
maybe you're just not
my physical type.

14:39.985 --> 14:42.819
Sure.
Sure, I understand.

14:42.819 --> 14:46.235
Hope we can have lunch
or go shopping

14:46.235 --> 14:48.277
or do something
together soon.

14:48.277 --> 14:50.736
- Okay, okay. Okay, bye.
- Bye, Lar.

14:53.653 --> 14:55.944
- What'd she say?
- No.

14:55.944 --> 14:58.944
- Mm.
- Not really her type.

14:58.944 --> 15:00.569
- Huh.
- At least, physically.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.653
- Okay. Well, hey...
- Yeah.

15:04.653 --> 15:07.611
- So, you gonna
go ahead with this?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:07.611 --> 15:11.235
- Okay.
- You should know that
she doesn't give blow jobs.

15:11.235 --> 15:13.402
- Just...
- That's okay.

15:13.402 --> 15:15.110
Okay? Sex
only in the dark.

15:15.110 --> 15:16.861
She's a little revolted
by the penis.

15:16.861 --> 15:18.611
- Really?
- She won't look at it.

15:18.611 --> 15:20.985
- She won't even touch it, okay?
- Well, maybe that's changed.

15:20.985 --> 15:23.611
- It won't change, okay?
- All right, good luck
with the fatwa.

15:23.611 --> 15:25.985
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks for being
so concerned about it.

15:56.027 --> 15:57.653
( car door closes )

15:57.653 --> 16:00.527
- You're in trouble, Larry.
- Yeah. Yeah!

16:00.527 --> 16:01.694
I know.
Tell me about it.

16:03.235 --> 16:04.444
- I like that.
- Oh, yeah?

16:04.444 --> 16:06.277
Yeah, hides the Jew.

16:06.277 --> 16:07.903
Ah, thank you.

16:07.903 --> 16:09.944
Thank you.
That's lovely.

16:09.944 --> 16:12.110
Lovely compliment.
Thank you very much.

16:12.110 --> 16:14.069
- Very sweet.
- What are you
doing here, Larry?

16:14.069 --> 16:16.194
- Huh?
- Well, you know...

16:16.194 --> 16:18.361
- What?
- ...this has been
very, very difficult for me.

16:18.361 --> 16:20.694
And I'm thinking,
who can help me?
I don't know any Muslims.

16:20.694 --> 16:23.944
They're not in show business.
They don't hang out at the deli.

16:23.944 --> 16:27.069
Am I supposed to
go into a mosque and then
start chatting them up?

16:27.069 --> 16:29.277
Sure, maybe I can make
a little more effort
to seek them out,

16:29.277 --> 16:30.903
but they're not really
coming up to me either!

16:30.903 --> 16:33.069
Do you need
my help, Larry?

16:35.235 --> 16:37.069
Yes.

16:37.069 --> 16:37.903
Yes.

16:40.069 --> 16:41.736
- I know people.
- You do?

16:41.736 --> 16:45.152
- Mm, I know people.
- Imams, mufti?

16:45.152 --> 16:46.944
- "Moofti."
- "Moofti"?

16:46.944 --> 16:48.903
- "Moofti."
- It's "moofti." Huh.

16:48.903 --> 16:50.235
I always thought
it was "muffti."

16:50.235 --> 16:54.944
Anyway,
so do you know
a mufti?

16:54.944 --> 16:57.069
- I know other people.
- Who? Who do you know?

16:57.069 --> 16:58.361
I know
the consul of Iran.

16:59.861 --> 17:01.569
You know the consul?

17:02.736 --> 17:04.444
- Is that so?
- Yes.

17:04.444 --> 17:06.819
Look at you!
You are really something!

17:06.819 --> 17:09.277
- Eh.
- How do you know
the consul?

17:09.277 --> 17:11.110
I have
my connections.

17:11.110 --> 17:14.444
Are you a--
are you a plotter?

17:14.444 --> 17:16.194
Are you one
of the plotters?

17:16.194 --> 17:19.778
- Do you plot?
- I've plotted before.

17:19.778 --> 17:21.944
- You've plotted?
- I've plotted.

17:21.944 --> 17:22.819
Wow.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.944
You're on my side,
right?

17:30.110 --> 17:31.861
Fuck me,
you godless fuck!

17:31.861 --> 17:33.611
You infidel fucking Jew!

17:33.611 --> 17:35.319
Try and keep it kosher,
could you?

17:35.319 --> 17:37.944
You fatwa fucking bastard!
( moans )

17:37.944 --> 17:41.277
- I'm a fatwa fuck.
- Yes! Talk dirty to me, Larry.

17:41.277 --> 17:44.778
Blaspheme to me
like you blasphemed
to the Nation of Islam!

17:44.778 --> 17:47.069
Donald Trump!
( panting )

17:47.069 --> 17:48.277
Steve Bannon!

17:48.277 --> 17:49.653
Jared Kushner!

17:49.653 --> 17:51.069
Mike Pence!

17:51.069 --> 17:52.903
Kellyanne Conway!

17:52.903 --> 17:54.486
- Mitch McConnell!
- Yeah!

17:54.486 --> 17:57.486
- Rudy Giuliani!
- ( moaning )

17:57.486 --> 17:59.110
- ( moaning )
- Yeah, yeah!

17:59.110 --> 18:00.778
Rougher, Larry!
Rougher!

18:00.778 --> 18:02.444
- Sentence me to an orgasm...
- You're choking me!

18:02.444 --> 18:04.319
...like you've been
sentenced to death!

18:04.319 --> 18:06.069
- ( screaming )
- Is this a fatwa!

18:06.069 --> 18:09.527
This is a fatwa!
Fa-fa-fa-fatwa!

18:09.527 --> 18:11.819
- ( door bursts open )
- Fatwa! Fatwa!

18:11.819 --> 18:13.653
- ( screaming )
- Leon: Hey! Hey!

18:13.653 --> 18:15.736
No fatwa up in here!
No fatwa!

18:15.736 --> 18:17.235
- What?
- No fatwa!

18:17.235 --> 18:18.819
Yeah, Larry, that's Swat,
your knew security.

18:18.819 --> 18:20.069
You can thank me later
for that shit.

18:20.069 --> 18:21.486
Yeah, I'm not even
gonna bring up

18:21.486 --> 18:23.277
the fact you're fucking
in your goddamn glasses.

18:23.277 --> 18:24.985
Hey, Swat,
break her ass in half!

18:29.653 --> 18:32.194
Hello, is this--
is this Mr. Khashayar?

18:32.194 --> 18:35.527
- Yes, this is he.
- Yeah, this is, um--
this is Larry David.

18:35.527 --> 18:38.152
I'm a friend
of Shara Ghorbani.

18:38.152 --> 18:41.778
She said that perhaps
there might be a way,

18:41.778 --> 18:44.277
you know, to set up
a, uh-- a meeting.

18:44.277 --> 18:47.611
It's better
if you don't come here
under the circumstances...

18:47.611 --> 18:51.110
- Hey, Larry.
- Wait, I'm sorry.
Could you hold on one second?

18:51.110 --> 18:53.110
Shut the fuck up!
I'm on the phone.

18:53.110 --> 18:56.027
Hey, I'm gonna
give Swat the guest room.
Where the towels at?

18:56.027 --> 18:58.527
They're down the hall
in the linen closet.

18:58.527 --> 19:00.027
Yes, I'm sorry.

19:00.027 --> 19:03.027
I have two nincompoops
in my house, unfortunately.

19:03.027 --> 19:05.861
- Anyway, so, um--
- Khashayar: I would suggest
a video conference.

19:05.861 --> 19:07.985
- Oh.
- I can arrange
for that if you like.

19:07.985 --> 19:09.194
Oh, you wanna
set up a video call?

19:09.194 --> 19:11.277
Yeah, the video call
would work great.

19:11.277 --> 19:13.402
- Yes, excellent.
- Yeah.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.527
Good. I will have
one of my staff members
contact you to arrange for it.

19:16.527 --> 19:17.778
- Yeah, I--
- Hey, Larry!

19:17.778 --> 19:19.444
Wait, I'm sorry.
Hold on one more sec.

19:19.444 --> 19:21.861
What the fuck
is wrong with you?
Shh, I'm on the phone!

19:21.861 --> 19:23.903
This goddamn towel's
hard as fuck, man.

19:23.903 --> 19:26.027
Shut the fuck up!
I'm on the phone!

19:26.027 --> 19:27.736
I'll be there in a second.
Shut up!

19:27.736 --> 19:28.985
These towels
too rough, man.

19:28.985 --> 19:31.569
- I like a softer towel.
- Hey, Swat? Swat?

19:31.569 --> 19:32.736
Shut up!

19:32.736 --> 19:34.277
Yeah, I'm sorry.

19:34.277 --> 19:36.402
No, it's
the nincompoops again.

19:36.402 --> 19:39.069
- Nincompoops?
- I'll wait to hear
from your office.

19:39.069 --> 19:41.527
- Larry!
- As I said,
they will be in contact.

19:41.527 --> 19:44.861
- ( stammering )
Yes, all right, thank you.
- Goodbye, Mr. David.

19:44.861 --> 19:48.611
- ( phone beeps )
- What's so important
about these fucking towels?

19:48.611 --> 19:50.694
Swat:
Look, these towels are
a little too rough, man.

19:50.694 --> 19:51.903
I like
a soft towel, Lar.

19:51.903 --> 19:53.361
He wants something
more velvety.

19:53.361 --> 19:55.444
Velvet, it doesn't even
dry you, velvet.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.361
It doesn't--
it doesn't get
the water off.

19:57.361 --> 20:00.194
A harder, coarser towel
works a lot better
for drying.

20:00.194 --> 20:02.778
If I don't use
something velvety,
I'ma get ashy as hell, Lar.

20:02.778 --> 20:05.277
- You want me to go
shopping for towels?
- It'd be nice.

20:05.277 --> 20:07.444
The man's
a guest in your house.
He's your fucking security.

20:07.444 --> 20:09.444
- He's gonna take care of you.
- By the way,

20:09.444 --> 20:11.444
you need to familiarize
yourself with that.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.611
- What? What is this?
- It's a list.

20:13.611 --> 20:16.486
- Persimmons.
You eat persimmons?
- Antioxidants.

20:16.486 --> 20:18.569
No stone fruit?

20:18.569 --> 20:19.944
I'm telling you,
they kill me, Larry.

20:19.944 --> 20:21.944
I'll drop dead right on
this fucking carpet.

20:21.944 --> 20:24.194
Even the "oals"
will fuck me up.

20:24.194 --> 20:27.152
- Even the what?
- The "oals" from the fruit
will fuck me up.

20:27.152 --> 20:29.778
If this fucking man
even sees a fucking
stone fruit,

20:29.778 --> 20:32.778
he's gonna eat the shit,
so don't bring no stone fruit
in the fucking house.

20:32.778 --> 20:34.444
So now I can't have
stone fruit?

20:35.611 --> 20:37.110
Yeah.

20:42.985 --> 20:44.527
Absolutely, we will
send that right up.

20:44.527 --> 20:45.694
All right,
thank you very much.

20:45.694 --> 20:48.152
- Hello.
- Ah, Mr. Dancer.

20:48.152 --> 20:52.319
I'm sorry to report
that I left a pair
of pajama bottoms

20:52.319 --> 20:54.653
in my room,
which was 1003.

20:54.653 --> 20:58.152
- So, just pajama bottoms?
- Fantastic pajamas, by the way.

20:58.152 --> 21:00.152
- I don't doubt it.
- I mean, the best feature
about them

21:00.152 --> 21:03.319
is that the flannel's thick,
so they obfuscate the penis,

21:03.319 --> 21:06.069
so you could walk around
with other people in the house

21:06.069 --> 21:07.486
and you don't see
any flopping,

21:07.486 --> 21:09.778
as opposed to the pair
that I have now,

21:09.778 --> 21:11.402
my-- my second pair.

21:11.402 --> 21:12.985
- Okay.
- A little thinner.

21:12.985 --> 21:15.694
You see the clear
outline of the penis--
very unpleasant.

21:15.694 --> 21:19.319
- I will check in the back
and I will be right with you.
- Thank you very much.

21:25.569 --> 21:27.194
Excuse me.

21:27.194 --> 21:29.027
Hi.

21:29.027 --> 21:31.903
Are you in charge
of the-- the cookies?

21:31.903 --> 21:33.736
Um, yeah, I guess so.

21:33.736 --> 21:36.194
So you oversee
the whole cookie operation?

21:36.194 --> 21:38.527
Uh, I don't bake them,
but I--

21:38.527 --> 21:40.653
Well, they're not baked,
they're bought in a store.

21:40.653 --> 21:42.027
But that's neither here
nor there.

21:42.027 --> 21:43.903
Let me just ask you
about the display here.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.985
- Okay.
- Was this
whole idea yours--

21:45.985 --> 21:48.736
the display, the tongs,
the whole thing?

21:48.736 --> 21:50.486
- Um...
- 'Cause I have
to tell you,

21:50.486 --> 21:52.152
the tong is not
a friend of the cookie

21:52.152 --> 21:53.819
by any stretch
of the imagination.

21:53.819 --> 21:56.235
Okay, you must be
Mr. Dancer.

21:56.235 --> 21:58.361
- Yes! Yes.
- Yes.

21:58.361 --> 21:59.736
- I am.
- Okay.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.861
What I believe
you should be thinking about

22:01.861 --> 22:03.569
is separating
the cookies

22:03.569 --> 22:06.527
so people can
use their fingers
and not the tongs.

22:06.527 --> 22:08.361
No friend
of the cookie.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.069
May I just demonstrate
what I'm talking about?

22:10.069 --> 22:12.235
- No, sir, please don't.
- Just watch how easy this is.

22:12.235 --> 22:14.569
- It's hotel policy.
- You see how easy
I picked that out?

22:14.569 --> 22:16.611
- It was so simple.
- Mr. Dancer.

22:16.611 --> 22:19.152
I successfully was able
to find your pajama bottoms,

22:19.152 --> 22:21.069
and I see that you are not
using our tongs again.

22:21.069 --> 22:23.069
No, I was just merely
demonstrating something...

22:23.069 --> 22:25.402
- I asked him to use the tongs.
- I know you did, Claudia.

22:25.402 --> 22:27.985
- Thank you very much.
- And by the way, you're not
even in charge of the cookies.

22:27.985 --> 22:31.819
- Claudia is.
- I asked you to
please follow our policy,

22:31.819 --> 22:34.819
and you are no longer
a guest here, actually,
so I'm just now asking you

22:34.819 --> 22:37.402
- to just respect that.
- Ah, what?

22:37.402 --> 22:38.611
What?

22:38.611 --> 22:40.069
Oh, my God!

22:40.069 --> 22:41.444
The tongs dropped
on the floor,

22:41.444 --> 22:43.277
you put them back
on the table?

22:43.277 --> 22:44.903
- I wiped them.
- She wiped them.

22:44.903 --> 22:46.819
That's like
eating off the floor!

22:46.819 --> 22:48.736
- It's the same thing!
- It's not at all the same.

22:48.736 --> 22:51.444
It is the same thing!
You might as well put
the floor on the table!

22:51.444 --> 22:53.527
- Okay, you know what?
- This is a disgrace!

22:53.527 --> 22:54.861
Okay, you know
what is a disgrace,

22:54.861 --> 22:56.361
that we're having
this conversation again.

22:56.361 --> 22:58.444
And here is what I'm gonna
say to you right now--

22:58.444 --> 23:00.736
don't ever return
to this hotel-- I'm serious--
or I will call the cops.

23:00.736 --> 23:03.277
Like I would wanna return
to a hotel that's serving
Pepperidge Farm cookies

23:03.277 --> 23:06.194
and trying to pass them off
as if you have a pastry chef!

23:06.194 --> 23:09.944
Fine, and if you do,
I will call the police,
Mr. Buck Dancer.

23:09.944 --> 23:11.944
Funkhouser:
Kenny was a perfect kid,

23:11.944 --> 23:14.194
and look
what's happened here!

23:14.194 --> 23:16.611
Look what's happened
to my jewel,

23:16.611 --> 23:20.027
my nephew, who is
an all-star pitcher.

23:20.027 --> 23:22.235
He's up there now
in a cast!

23:22.235 --> 23:25.110
Why did you have to
fight him for the pickle?

23:25.110 --> 23:27.611
Why did I have to fight him?
You fought him for
the pickles, too!

23:27.611 --> 23:29.319
I didn't fight him;
I let it go!

23:29.319 --> 23:30.361
Oh, you let it go.

23:30.361 --> 23:31.903
You tried to open
that pickle jar

23:31.903 --> 23:33.027
just like I did!

23:33.027 --> 23:34.778
Everybody wants to be
a pickle jar hero.

23:34.778 --> 23:36.736
You broke
his elbow, okay?

23:36.736 --> 23:37.944
Are you happy?

23:37.944 --> 23:39.569
He's just
a different kid.

23:39.569 --> 23:41.653
His personality
has changed.

23:41.653 --> 23:43.527
He's filled
with angst.

23:43.527 --> 23:45.277
He's, like,
ready to explode.

23:45.277 --> 23:46.736
And you wanna know why?

23:46.736 --> 23:50.985
The way he relaxes
is the way all men relax.

23:50.985 --> 23:53.486
It's called
"ejaculation."

23:53.486 --> 23:56.027
He can't use
the right hand, okay?

23:56.027 --> 23:58.736
This is his
ejaculator, okay?

23:58.736 --> 24:00.486
It's done,
it's in a cast.

24:00.486 --> 24:03.152
- Yeah.
- Mr. Kenny, some lunch!

24:03.152 --> 24:05.444
- Kenny: What the hell
is this shit? Fuck!
- ( glass shattering )

24:05.444 --> 24:08.486
You call this lunch?
Take your banana and
shove it up your ass!

24:08.486 --> 24:10.694
- Get out! Get the fuck out!
- Señor, he's crazy!

24:10.694 --> 24:12.569
- Leave me the fuck alone!
- ( clattering )

24:12.569 --> 24:14.527
I don't even
know him anymore.

24:14.527 --> 24:16.694
- Wow.
- I'm scared
to death of him.

24:16.694 --> 24:18.736
He can't masturbate.

24:18.736 --> 24:20.486
He can't make it
come out.

24:20.486 --> 24:23.152
- He can't go left?
- No, he can't go to his left.

24:23.152 --> 24:25.069
- Can you go to your left?
- Eh, nobody can.

24:25.069 --> 24:26.736
- No one can.
- Yeah.

24:26.736 --> 24:29.027
It's funny, though,
there's other things
I can do lefty.

24:29.027 --> 24:31.569
I can eat lefty,
I can brush my teeth lefty.

24:31.569 --> 24:34.027
There's
a big difference.

24:34.027 --> 24:37.277
You need rotation,
you need tempo,

24:37.277 --> 24:39.027
you need feel.

24:39.027 --> 24:40.361
I don't know
what's gonna happen

24:40.361 --> 24:42.277
'cause he can't
concentrate anymore.

24:42.277 --> 24:45.861
He told me today
he doesn't give a shit
about the SATs.

24:45.861 --> 24:47.985
He doesn't care
about Stanford.

24:47.985 --> 24:50.069
He doesn't care
about anything.

24:50.069 --> 24:52.611
- Wow.
- He's lost his will.

24:52.611 --> 24:54.194
Hey!

24:56.985 --> 25:01.611
I met this woman
in the-- in the hotel,

25:01.611 --> 25:05.319
and I think-- I think
she could help him.

25:05.319 --> 25:06.569
What does she do?

25:06.569 --> 25:09.569
She's a--
she's a prostitute.

25:09.569 --> 25:13.069
( Leon sighs )

25:13.069 --> 25:15.653
Okay,
here's the deal.

25:15.653 --> 25:18.027
You're gonna go in there,
you're gonna go to the right,

25:18.027 --> 25:20.069
- near the front desk.
- Mm-hmm.

25:20.069 --> 25:22.611
- You're gonna try and open
this jar of pickles.
- Okay.

25:22.611 --> 25:25.903
It's gonna create a diversion,
everybody's gonna come over
and try and help,

25:25.903 --> 25:28.611
and then I'm gonna sneak in
so the guy doesn't see me

25:28.611 --> 25:30.861
- and try and find Paula, okay?
- Right, right, right.

25:30.861 --> 25:33.110
This is called
the "pickle gambit."

25:33.110 --> 25:35.152
I like that, man.
Hey, it's cool.

25:35.152 --> 25:38.110
- What's my name?
- All right, that's irrelevant.

25:38.110 --> 25:39.527
- Okay?
- What do you mean
it's irrelevant?

25:39.527 --> 25:41.027
- Okay, you want a name?
- I want a fucking name!

25:41.027 --> 25:43.527
Okay, uh, Chick Gandil,
that's your name.

25:43.527 --> 25:45.903
He played first base
for the 1919 White Sox,

25:45.903 --> 25:47.653
the team that threw
the World Series.

25:47.653 --> 25:49.985
Wait a fucking minute.
I'm not gonna be on no
goddamn White Sox.

25:49.985 --> 25:52.444
Would you prefer somebody
from the Negro leagues?

25:52.444 --> 25:54.611
Yeah, give me
a fucking name.

25:54.611 --> 25:57.861
- Chappie Johnson.
- That's a black man's name
right there.

25:57.861 --> 25:59.277
That's fucking great.
I love it.

25:59.277 --> 26:00.611
- All right.
- I can do that shit.

26:00.611 --> 26:01.819
- Okay, get in there.
- I got you.

26:01.819 --> 26:04.110
Okay, I'm a--
I'm a diversion.

26:04.110 --> 26:06.069
I got you.
I fucking got you,
Lar, all right?

26:12.152 --> 26:14.527
( grunts )
My name is
Chappie Johnson

26:14.527 --> 26:17.069
and I can't open
this damn pickle jar.

26:17.069 --> 26:18.985
- Let me take a crack at that.
- I can help you with that.

26:18.985 --> 26:20.819
I'm gonna have to put you
on hold for a second.

26:20.819 --> 26:22.736
Give it here, Chappie.
Give me a shot at it.

26:22.736 --> 26:23.985
Guys, I saw
from over there.

26:23.985 --> 26:25.319
Let me just get
a run at it, all right?

26:25.319 --> 26:26.653
I'm small,
but you'd be surprised.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.194
( grunting )

26:28.194 --> 26:30.778
( voices overlapping )

26:30.778 --> 26:33.152
Leon:
Let me see that,
let me see that.

26:33.152 --> 26:33.985
( grunts )

26:35.194 --> 26:36.611
Just try it again.

26:36.611 --> 26:37.985
Put force into it.

26:37.985 --> 26:39.611
- I didn't--
- I got it, I got it.

26:39.611 --> 26:40.778
I didn't get
a good run at it.

26:40.778 --> 26:41.861
Come on!

26:51.486 --> 26:53.027
Larry, it's me.

26:53.027 --> 26:55.277
Oh, my God.

26:55.277 --> 26:58.110
( gasps )
Oh, my God!

26:58.110 --> 27:00.778
- Look at you.
- Do you like it?

27:00.778 --> 27:03.152
I-- I'm stunned!

27:03.152 --> 27:06.653
This is-- I--
my mind's exploding!

27:06.653 --> 27:08.444
- Oh, my gosh.
- This is incredible.

27:08.444 --> 27:10.778
- Look at you.
Look at you!
- Oh, really?

27:10.778 --> 27:12.194
- Ugh!
- You think so?

27:12.194 --> 27:13.778
Well, I am so happy,

27:13.778 --> 27:15.152
and I owe it all
to you.

27:15.152 --> 27:17.027
- It worked.
- It worked.

27:17.027 --> 27:19.027
It worked.
My life has been changed.

27:19.027 --> 27:20.235
Business--
never been better.

27:20.235 --> 27:22.611
The men--
gentle, respectful.

27:22.611 --> 27:25.319
I did a hooker mitzvah!
It's a hooker mitzvah!

27:25.319 --> 27:26.778
You are
a visionary.

27:26.778 --> 27:30.069
I don't know what I can do
to properly show my thanks.

27:30.069 --> 27:31.569
You don't have
to do anything.

27:31.569 --> 27:33.861
The mere fact that
you're happier having sex

27:33.861 --> 27:35.486
with a multitude
of strangers,

27:35.486 --> 27:38.402
that's all-- that's all
the thanks I need.

27:38.402 --> 27:39.819
Aw, Larry!

27:39.819 --> 27:41.611
That's awesome.
Thank you!

27:41.611 --> 27:44.611
You know what?
This is unbelievable
that I actually ran--

27:44.611 --> 27:46.736
I came here specifically
looking for you.

27:46.736 --> 27:48.402
- Oh, you did?
- Yes, I did.

27:48.402 --> 27:50.653
- Oh, that's amazing!
- Yeah, because I actually do

27:50.653 --> 27:51.778
- need your services.
- You do?

27:51.778 --> 27:53.402
- Yes.
- Okay, well, fine.

27:53.402 --> 27:55.903
It's for-- it's for
my friend's nephew.

27:55.903 --> 27:58.194
- His name is
Kenny Funkhouser.
- Of course!

27:58.194 --> 28:00.069
Tell me when and where.
I'll be there.

28:00.069 --> 28:02.402
- No problem.
- Fanta--

28:02.402 --> 28:04.110
- I feel great, I feel great.
- Hey, do you want a drink?

28:04.110 --> 28:05.944
- Just a quick drink?
- Uh, no, let's get a, uh--

28:05.944 --> 28:08.736
let's raid the minibar
like normal people.

28:08.736 --> 28:10.569
( both chuckling )

28:12.778 --> 28:14.444
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

28:14.444 --> 28:16.152
Yes.

28:16.152 --> 28:18.319
( both chuckling,
chattering )

28:19.944 --> 28:21.653
Claudia:
Here, give it to me,
give it to me!

28:21.653 --> 28:23.152
Man:
You can't open it!

28:23.152 --> 28:24.903
Claudia:
We need to get
a butter knife.

28:24.903 --> 28:26.527
- Come on, let me
give it another try.
- No.

28:26.527 --> 28:28.110
( Ted and Cheryl
chuckling )

28:28.110 --> 28:29.736
( chattering )

28:29.736 --> 28:31.486
Man:
We need a plier,
we need a plier.

28:31.486 --> 28:34.653
But a hatchet will
shatter the entire jar.

28:34.653 --> 28:36.319
- Man: Get a plier.
- Leon: She can't open it.

28:36.319 --> 28:38.235
- What, 'cause I'm a woman?
- Yeah, exactly!

28:38.235 --> 28:39.778
( Claudia grunts )

28:39.778 --> 28:41.277
- We need one more shot.
- Give me that!

28:41.277 --> 28:43.152
- Mr. Dancer!
- ( grunts )

28:43.152 --> 28:45.235
All: Whoa!

28:45.235 --> 28:46.985
- Larry: Huh?
- Wow.

28:46.985 --> 28:48.778
- Yeah!
- Wow, are you serious?

28:48.778 --> 28:50.486
Are you for--
Claudia, get security.

28:50.486 --> 28:52.235
I'll keep
Mr. Buck Dancer here.

28:52.235 --> 28:53.653
- Okay?
- ( stammering )
No, I gotta get--

28:53.653 --> 28:55.361
Manager:
I don't care, I don't care.

28:55.361 --> 28:57.277
I'm not touching cookies,
I'm not talking tongs!

28:57.277 --> 28:59.611
I don't care! I warned you
if you came back here,
this would happen.

28:59.611 --> 29:01.444
- Get out of my way, baldy!
- Ah-ah!

29:01.444 --> 29:04.194
- That is it, sir.
You are out of here.
- Unhand me, you brute!

29:04.194 --> 29:05.277
I have dementia!

29:17.069 --> 29:18.653
What the...?

29:20.861 --> 29:22.985
Unbelievable!

29:22.985 --> 29:25.277
- As often as I can.
- Really?

29:25.277 --> 29:26.319
- Yes...
- No.

29:26.319 --> 29:28.778
( chatter continues )

29:31.944 --> 29:33.486
( car horn honking )

29:38.110 --> 29:40.361
- Paula:
So, are you nervous?
- A little.

29:40.361 --> 29:42.527
Oh, well, don't worry.
I'll take care of everything.

29:42.527 --> 29:44.527
- You just lay back
and relax.
- Okay.

29:44.527 --> 29:46.861
- ( chuckles )
- I like your dress.

29:46.861 --> 29:49.694
Aw, thanks!
I got it at
Saks Fifth Avenue.

29:49.694 --> 29:52.027
- Oh, that-- that's
a nice store.
- Mm-hmm.

29:52.027 --> 29:53.985
Take your clothes off,
Kenny.

29:53.985 --> 29:55.527
You know, Mary,
she's with this guy,

29:55.527 --> 29:57.736
he's bald with glasses--
he looks just like me!

29:57.736 --> 30:00.027
She said
I wasn't her type.

30:00.027 --> 30:02.861
Unbelievable.
And now Ted--

30:02.861 --> 30:05.194
Ted's going out
with Cheryl.

30:05.194 --> 30:09.486
- What about that?
- Well, you haven't been
married to her in a long time.

30:09.486 --> 30:10.736
There's nothing wrong
with that!

30:10.736 --> 30:12.361
Would you do
something like that?

30:12.361 --> 30:14.611
You wanna go out with Cheryl,
you do it behind my back.

30:14.611 --> 30:16.611
- You'd never know.
- That's the way to do it.

30:16.611 --> 30:18.653
Yeah.
I called Cheryl.

30:20.027 --> 30:21.903
- I called her twice.
- For what?

30:21.903 --> 30:24.069
Just to talk to her
and see how she was doing,

30:24.069 --> 30:27.069
and shopping tips
and stuff like that.

30:27.069 --> 30:29.235
- We had a cup of coffee.
- You're kidding.

30:29.235 --> 30:31.903
- Two movies.
- What?

30:31.903 --> 30:33.402
A walk in the park.

30:33.402 --> 30:35.653
Yeah, well,
it's not a big deal.

30:35.653 --> 30:36.653
One dinner.

30:36.653 --> 30:38.027
I went behind your back!

30:38.027 --> 30:39.903
It's the only way to go!

30:39.903 --> 30:41.653
- Yeah, that's true.
- ( Paula giggling )

30:41.653 --> 30:45.486
Boy, Kenny sounds like
he's having some fun.

30:45.486 --> 30:47.069
Tough to
listen to, though.

30:47.069 --> 30:48.861
- ( Kenny moans )
- Oh, my God.

30:48.861 --> 30:53.569
Oh, I got a--
I got a Skype thing
with the Iranian consul guy.

30:54.778 --> 30:55.985
I'll see you later.

30:55.985 --> 30:57.903
I'm not staying here
by myself.

30:59.611 --> 31:00.944
( door opens )

31:02.486 --> 31:04.778
( door closes )

31:04.778 --> 31:07.486
Mr. David, at last we meet
face-to-face.

31:07.486 --> 31:09.527
Heh-hey!
Hey, look at this!

31:09.527 --> 31:11.277
Modern technology, sir.

31:11.277 --> 31:14.194
What-- what exactly
does a consul do?
It's a...

31:14.194 --> 31:16.944
Let's just say if you wanted
to come to Iran one day
and visit,

31:16.944 --> 31:18.861
you would be
going through myself.

31:18.861 --> 31:21.277
I'm not setting
foot in that place,
with all due respect.

31:21.277 --> 31:22.903
Not gonna
set foot there.

31:24.110 --> 31:25.736
Excuse me.

31:27.277 --> 31:29.653
- What is that?
- A cookie.

31:29.653 --> 31:31.694
What are you using,
tongs?

31:31.694 --> 31:33.778
Yes.
We use tongs.

31:33.778 --> 31:37.277
- In fact,
we invented the tong.
- ( scoffs ) Okay.

31:37.277 --> 31:39.110
All right, Mr. Consul,

31:39.110 --> 31:40.985
let's, uh-- let's not
go crazy here.

31:40.985 --> 31:42.944
You invented the tong.
I don't think so.

31:42.944 --> 31:45.569
I don't see Iran
as the tong inventor.

31:45.569 --> 31:47.736
Mr. David, I have
a very busy agenda today.

31:47.736 --> 31:49.486
Please let me know
how I can help you.

31:49.486 --> 31:53.235
Well, um, you're aware
of my situation, of course,

31:53.235 --> 31:56.694
and I was
hoping beyond hope

31:56.694 --> 32:00.694
that somehow
you could perhaps

32:00.694 --> 32:03.944
put in
a good word for me,

32:03.944 --> 32:07.486
tell the ayatollah
how profoundly sorry I am

32:07.486 --> 32:09.527
for what I did
and said and...

32:09.527 --> 32:12.361
Mr. David, you have come
to the right person

32:12.361 --> 32:14.944
because-- I tell you this
in confidence--

32:14.944 --> 32:17.235
I am a huge fan
of your work.

32:17.235 --> 32:20.152
I have watched
every episode of "Seinfeld."

32:20.152 --> 32:22.069
( gasps )

32:22.069 --> 32:25.110
This is-- this is
really, truly remarkable.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.194
Is that so?
What's your favorite episode?

32:27.194 --> 32:28.694
( chuckles )

32:28.694 --> 32:31.069
Isn't everybody's
favorite episode
the puffy shirt?

32:31.069 --> 32:32.527
It's unbelievable!

32:32.527 --> 32:34.819
I also love the one
with the close talker.

32:34.819 --> 32:36.235
Ugh, oh, my God!

32:36.235 --> 32:38.736
I must tell you
something, Mr. David.

32:38.736 --> 32:42.152
The ayatollah himself
is a bit of a close talker.

32:42.152 --> 32:43.985
- Is that so?
- Yes!

32:43.985 --> 32:46.611
Oh, I wouldn't wanna get
too close to that guy,
to tell you the truth.

32:46.611 --> 32:48.194
It doesn't look like
he's popping Life Savers

32:48.194 --> 32:49.985
in his mouth
all day long, you know?

32:49.985 --> 32:51.778
Ah, yes, well...

32:51.778 --> 32:53.611
- ( Kenny panting ) Okay.
- Paula: All right.

32:53.611 --> 32:54.985
Paula:
Okay, oh, yeah!

32:54.985 --> 32:56.194
Come on.
Come on, honey!

32:56.194 --> 32:57.819
You can do it,
you can do it!

32:57.819 --> 32:59.444
- Come on, come on!
- ( Kenny screams )

32:59.444 --> 33:01.944
- ( both moaning )
- I'm coming, Larry!

33:01.944 --> 33:03.819
Paula:
Oh, God,
you're so good!

33:03.819 --> 33:05.694
- Larry!
- ( Paula screams )

33:05.694 --> 33:07.611
I am very confident
that we can

33:07.611 --> 33:09.736
accomplish something
here together.

33:09.736 --> 33:12.319
Thank you so much.
I'm so appreciative and--

33:12.319 --> 33:14.778
- ( Paula screaming )
- Uncle Marty, Uncle Marty!

33:14.778 --> 33:16.402
What the-- oh!

33:16.402 --> 33:17.569
Oh, my God!

33:17.569 --> 33:19.235
- Oh, no!
- What is that?

33:19.235 --> 33:20.736
Oh, oh! No!

33:20.736 --> 33:23.402
No, no! Swat, Swat!
Not her, not her!

33:23.402 --> 33:25.402
Just get rid
of the Muslims!

33:26.985 --> 33:30.069
( stammering )
No, it's a game!

33:30.069 --> 33:32.736
That's a game!
Mr. Consul!

33:32.736 --> 33:34.736
( screams )

33:34.736 --> 33:37.569
( theme music playing )

34:48.486 --> 34:49.985
You have no compassion,

34:49.985 --> 34:52.903
have no caring
about another human being...

34:52.903 --> 34:54.527
There's some partial truth
to that.

34:54.527 --> 34:55.319
Yeah.

34:56.277 --> 34:58.277
T, can you get
a lemon with that, please?

34:58.277 --> 34:58.985
T?

34:58.985 --> 34:59.985
It's short for Ted.

34:59.985 --> 35:01.653
Never gave me
any little nicknames.

35:01.653 --> 35:02.944
You could've called me L-vid.

35:02.944 --> 35:04.778
-As a term of endearment?
-Yeah.

35:04.778 --> 35:06.819
Like, "Let's spoon, L-vid"?

35:06.819 --> 35:07.736
(HONKS CAR HORN)

35:08.235 --> 35:09.903
POLICE OFFICER:
Bad decision to honk
at a police officer.

35:09.903 --> 35:11.444
Oh, what-- Why?
Are you above the beep?

35:11.444 --> 35:12.152
Absolutely.

35:12.527 --> 35:13.903
I'm a police officer,
I protect your rights.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.944
-My rights to beep!
-You gettin' smart with me, boy?

35:15.944 --> 35:17.861
I'm not getting smart.
I am smart.
