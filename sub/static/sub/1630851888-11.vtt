25:53.886 --> 25:56.962
Hopefully rebuilding
what, you know--

25:57.114 --> 25:58.538
The same feelings we had,
like, weeks ago

25:58.558 --> 26:00.449
When we were, like, cloud nine.

26:00.542 --> 26:01.617
You know, it's gonna take
a lot of work,

26:01.710 --> 26:03.877
But we'll definitely get there,
for sure.

26:03.896 --> 26:07.213
- Moving forward, this week,
now we gotta put actions

26:07.233 --> 26:10.142
Behind all of this
conversation, you know.

26:10.236 --> 26:13.887
And I really do think
we'll both be successful.

26:13.981 --> 26:16.407
This was just a bad three days.

26:16.558 --> 26:17.557
Like, that's insane.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.577
After, like,
an amazing three weeks,

26:19.804 --> 26:21.728
We had a bad
three days, you know.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.581
So I really am looking forward

26:23.808 --> 26:26.250
To where next week
will take us.

26:26.477 --> 26:29.812
- And I will definitely
do anything I can,

26:29.830 --> 26:31.589
Moving forward,
to prove that to you.

26:31.740 --> 26:34.741
I mean, there's nothing
I won't do for this marriage.

34:06.119 --> 34:08.694
I think we're growing

34:08.714 --> 34:10.455
I don't even want
to say comfortable,

34:27.566 --> 34:29.549

34:29.568 --> 34:32.143
And two, the pace that we took.

34:32.296 --> 34:34.571
Because, you know,
things can start off hot,

34:34.722 --> 34:36.298
And those can be good.

34:36.316 --> 34:37.799

34:37.892 --> 34:39.058

34:39.152 --> 34:41.653
But then, you know, like,

34:41.747 --> 34:44.989

You want to check me out?
- I love it.

1:01:51.858 --> 1:01:53.691
I love it.

1:01:53.785 --> 1:01:55.359
- And just really caring
about how I feel

1:01:55.379 --> 1:01:57.713
On our one-month anniversary.

1:01:57.864 --> 1:01:59.773
Let's play.

1:01:59.791 --> 1:02:01.883
- Good.

1:02:02.035 --> 1:02:05.036
Oh, jeez.
- [laughs]

1:02:05.130 --> 1:02:06.722
- It's all right.

1:02:06.873 --> 1:02:08.114
Little high, there you go.

1:02:08.133 --> 1:02:09.540
It's all right.

1:02:09.634 --> 1:02:10.225
- I have a fear of balls.

1:02:10.452 --> 1:02:13.061
In my face.

1:02:13.213 --> 1:02:16.957
- Shut--my god, shut up.

1:02:16.975 --> 1:02:18.216
- Don't be afraid. Of balls.

1:02:18.235 --> 1:02:19.459
- That's right,
don't be afraid.

1:02:19.552 --> 1:02:20.551
Step into it.
- In your face.

1:02:20.571 --> 1:02:21.811
- That's right.

1:02:21.905 --> 1:02:23.572
How's the glove feel?

1:02:23.723 --> 1:02:26.649
- Perfect.

1:02:26.802 --> 1:02:27.909
There we go.
- There you go, good catch.

1:02:28.136 --> 1:02:29.302
Good catch.

1:02:29.321 --> 1:02:32.080

1:02:32.232 --> 1:02:34.324

1:02:34.476 --> 1:02:36.251
<i> We were going through</i>
<i> some major issues.</i>

1:02:36.478 --> 1:02:39.570
I was having doubts
whether I loved my husband,

1:02:39.664 --> 1:02:41.498
Even if I wanted
to be with my husband.

1:02:41.650 --> 1:02:42.758
- I can say you look a lot--

1:02:42.985 --> 1:02:44.501
A hell of a lot cuter
like that.

1:02:44.653 --> 1:02:46.002
- Like this?
- Uh-huh.

1:02:46.096 --> 1:02:46.820
You look sexy.

1:02:46.838 --> 1:02:48.338
[chuckles] I love it.

1:02:48.490 --> 1:02:51.174
- And now to be here

1:02:51.326 --> 1:02:52.842
On our one-month anniversary

<i> Fully in love</i>

1:02:56.940 --> 1:02:58.681
It's--it feels great.

1:02:58.776 --> 1:02:59.757
This is awesome.

1:02:59.851 --> 1:03:04.428
- So did you ever
expect to be here?

1:03:04.523 --> 1:03:06.689
- On a baseball field? No.

1:03:06.784 --> 1:03:07.765
- Well, that too.

1:03:07.859 --> 1:03:09.767
But as far as--
- in our marriage?

1:03:09.861 --> 1:03:12.012
- Yes, through one month.

1:03:12.105 --> 1:03:14.122
- No, I didn't know
what to expect in a month.

1:03:14.349 --> 1:03:16.774
But I can say
I'm very happy where I am.

1:03:16.794 --> 1:03:19.853
I mean, there are
definitely topics we still

1:03:19.871 --> 1:03:23.965
Need to talk about
and discuss, but--

1:03:24.117 --> 1:03:28.044
- But speaking of which,

1:03:28.196 --> 1:03:28.804
The whole joint accounts, like,

1:03:29.031 --> 1:03:31.047
Separate accounts and stuff,

1:03:31.199 --> 1:03:32.974
Like, my one strategic plan

1:03:33.201 --> 1:03:35.368
Of having one joint account
is not the best way?

1:03:35.461 --> 1:03:38.629
Okay, cool, we can have
separate accounts. But--

1:03:38.723 --> 1:03:40.540
- That's what I said--
kept suggesting.

1:03:40.559 --> 1:03:41.724
- Oh, yeah.

1:03:41.877 --> 1:03:43.652
Holy crap, like, I really don't

1:03:43.879 --> 1:03:46.655
Listen as well as I thought.
- [chuckles]

1:03:46.806 --> 1:03:50.216
- I need to pay more attention
to what you tell me.

1:03:50.310 --> 1:03:51.551
And I'm open to it, so--
- yeah.

1:03:51.644 --> 1:03:53.328
I mean, I would
appreciate that.

1:03:53.555 --> 1:03:56.331
I would feel
more comfortable with that.

1:03:56.482 --> 1:04:00.060
You know, like,
I know you're the finance guy,

1:04:00.153 --> 1:04:02.579
But it's all
about compromising.

1:04:02.673 --> 1:04:04.898
It took some crazy fight

1:04:04.916 --> 1:04:07.250
To help bring
all those issues out,

1:04:07.402 --> 1:04:09.344
And even with the bad, like,

1:04:09.571 --> 1:04:11.329
I'm really glad it happened.
It's weird.

1:04:11.423 --> 1:04:13.348
Like, no one would believe me,
but it brought out some issues

1:04:13.575 --> 1:04:16.910
That I was having
in the beginning.

1:04:16.928 --> 1:04:18.745
A lot of it with, like,

1:04:18.838 --> 1:04:21.839
The decisions I felt like
I'm making in order to--

1:04:21.859 --> 1:04:23.191
What, at the time,

1:04:23.418 --> 1:04:25.602
Was to fit into your mold.
- Yep.

1:04:25.754 --> 1:04:26.769
- And of course,
like, I wanted to.

1:04:26.864 --> 1:04:28.421
Like, it was a marriage.

1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:30.031
I knew I was gonna
have to make sacrifices.

1:04:30.258 --> 1:04:31.849
But they all just
piled up on me.

1:04:31.869 --> 1:04:33.443
- Right.
- And it freaked me out.

1:04:33.537 --> 1:04:37.038
But now we stand here,

1:04:37.190 --> 1:04:40.191
Me being able to talk about it
without any hesitation,

1:04:40.210 --> 1:04:42.693
With me really,
really telling you

1:04:42.713 --> 1:04:44.938
Exactly how I feel
about everything.

1:04:44.956 --> 1:04:47.941
You know, I don't feel
any kind of pressure anymore.

1:04:48.034 --> 1:04:50.460
I feel like you are listening
and you are open.

1:04:50.554 --> 1:04:53.947
I feel great.
- I do too.

1:04:53.965 --> 1:04:56.057
- Like, I feel great about
where we are.

1:04:56.284 --> 1:04:57.617
Happy first month, you know.
- Happy first month.

1:04:57.636 --> 1:04:59.953
Having rachel here with me,
I mean,

1:05:00.046 --> 1:05:00.896
This is something
that I've always wanted.

1:05:01.047 --> 1:05:03.398
I've always wanted
that teammate,

1:05:03.549 --> 1:05:05.734
That person that would
want to do things with me.

1:05:05.885 --> 1:05:07.460
<i> It's surreal to think</i>
<i> that we went through</i>

1:05:07.479 --> 1:05:08.962
<i> Everything that we</i>

1:05:08.980 --> 1:05:10.388

1:05:10.407 --> 1:05:11.814
<i> As we were</i>
<i> the day of our wedding.</i>

1:05:11.967 --> 1:05:12.908
And so, you know, for me,

1:05:13.059 --> 1:05:15.969
This is exactly
what I wanted in a wife.

1:05:15.987 --> 1:05:18.246
This is exactly what I wanted.
That's rachel.

1:05:18.398 --> 1:05:20.490
- I can easily say where our
next month is gonna take us.

1:05:20.642 --> 1:05:23.159
- Europe?

1:05:23.253 --> 1:05:27.997
- No, like, saying yes,
that we want to...

1:05:28.150 --> 1:05:30.091
Keep going with this.
And now really, really--

1:05:30.243 --> 1:05:31.818
- Oh, I don't know about that.
I'm just kidding.

1:05:31.836 --> 1:05:33.820
- Stop!

1:05:33.913 --> 1:05:35.847
<i> - ♪ have I felt</i>

1:05:47.018 --> 1:05:49.444
- Hello.

1:05:49.671 --> 1:05:53.173
- Hello, hi.

1:05:53.191 --> 1:05:54.524
- Hey, you guys did new art.
- We did this together.

1:05:54.676 --> 1:05:55.951
- Aww.

1:05:56.102 --> 1:05:58.269
- Kim, hey.
- Hey, how are you?

1:05:58.288 --> 1:05:59.195
Don't laugh.
I know you're laughing at me.

1:05:59.289 --> 1:06:01.623
It was a skiing accident,
you know.

1:06:01.850 --> 1:06:03.199
<i> - I came over to visit</i>
<i> my friend kim.</i>

1:06:03.351 --> 1:06:06.519
She recently tore her acl.
- How are you?

1:06:06.612 --> 1:06:08.129
- Brought us some food.
- Oh, perfect.

1:06:08.281 --> 1:06:09.355
- She probably
knows me the best

1:06:09.449 --> 1:06:10.131
Out of anybody on this planet.

1:06:10.358 --> 1:06:12.616
<i> Her advice is always exactly</i>

1:06:12.636 --> 1:06:14.469
<i> What I need to hear</i>
<i> at the right time.</i>

1:06:14.620 --> 1:06:17.864
And I just kind of need to
lean on her advice right now.

1:06:17.882 --> 1:06:18.974
- You've been married
for, like, a month now, right?

1:06:19.201 --> 1:06:20.976
- Yeah.
- How are things going, though,

1:06:21.203 --> 1:06:24.370
With, like, just a connection?
Are you guys

1:06:24.464 --> 1:06:26.222
Getting to know
each other a lot better?

1:06:26.316 --> 1:06:29.392
I know you were concerned
about just chemistry.

1:06:29.544 --> 1:06:31.377
- It feels like a lot of times,

1:06:31.471 --> 1:06:33.229
When we're doing an activity,

1:06:33.323 --> 1:06:35.490
She thinks about the end goal
of the activity

1:06:35.717 --> 1:06:38.735
And treats it as a--
like a mission.

1:06:38.887 --> 1:06:40.887
For example, we did painting,

1:06:40.905 --> 1:06:42.831
And the--she's just focused on
painting the perfect picture.

1:06:43.058 --> 1:06:46.334
Like, she even corrected
my painting

1:06:46.561 --> 1:06:47.727
Because it didn't
line up perfectly.

1:06:47.746 --> 1:06:49.412
I'm just gonna wing it.

1:06:49.564 --> 1:06:52.081
- No, don't do that. Oh, no.

1:06:52.234 --> 1:06:53.991
- It has been winged.
- Yours is too high.

1:06:54.011 --> 1:06:57.253
- I was okay
with the imperfections.

1:06:57.405 --> 1:06:59.014
I was more interested in...

1:06:59.241 --> 1:07:00.907
- Just that interaction
together.

1:07:00.925 --> 1:07:02.925
- The process, yeah.
Like, doing things together

1:07:03.078 --> 1:07:05.428
And having the little playful
moments while we're painting.

1:07:05.580 --> 1:07:09.524
But there isn't--
there wasn't any of that.

1:07:09.675 --> 1:07:15.605
There's no flirtation.
There's no--I don't know.

1:07:15.757 --> 1:07:18.441
- I think if johnny keeps
focusing on the negative things

1:07:18.535 --> 1:07:20.684
<i> About his marriage,</i>

1:07:20.704 --> 1:07:21.870
<i> That is gonna cause him</i>
<i> to retreat</i>

1:07:22.021 --> 1:07:26.266
And not put 100%
into the marriage.

1:07:26.284 --> 1:07:28.043
So what are some things
that you can do to help her,

1:07:28.194 --> 1:07:31.287
You know, maybe have those--
- I think--I think it's to--

1:07:31.439 --> 1:07:33.456
I need to initiate
more romance.

1:07:33.608 --> 1:07:34.624
- That might help.
- But, like, part of me

1:07:34.718 --> 1:07:37.535
Doesn't even--it feels like
when I have to--

1:07:37.554 --> 1:07:38.386
When I'm forced
to do something,

1:07:38.538 --> 1:07:40.371
It makes me want to do it less.

1:07:40.390 --> 1:07:41.890
And actually,
it takes me out of it.

1:07:42.117 --> 1:07:43.391
- Have y'all talked
to each other about this?

1:07:43.618 --> 1:07:44.784
Have you talked
to her about this?

1:07:44.803 --> 1:07:46.636
- This is just something
I thought about today.

1:07:46.730 --> 1:07:47.896
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

1:07:48.123 --> 1:07:51.066
- How's it been

1:07:51.293 --> 1:07:54.143
- It's been pretty good,
it's been pretty good.

1:07:54.237 --> 1:07:56.738
- Yeah?

1:07:56.965 --> 1:07:58.798
- One of the things
that's a little odd

1:07:58.817 --> 1:08:03.303
About the relationship is,
he doesn't initiate

1:08:03.396 --> 1:08:05.413
Any kind of physical intimacy.

1:08:05.640 --> 1:08:07.731
Even, like, cuddling,
he doesn't cuddle.

1:08:07.826 --> 1:08:09.309
Like, I have to initiate.

1:08:09.402 --> 1:08:10.401
I'm big spoon
all the darn time.

1:08:10.420 --> 1:08:14.422
I've never been
little spoon, ever.

1:08:14.574 --> 1:08:16.999
- As girls,
we tend to, like--

1:08:17.094 --> 1:08:20.002
Like, when we get mad
and stuff like that,

1:08:20.155 --> 1:08:24.657
We tend to not talk about it,
or maybe we wanted the guys

1:08:24.676 --> 1:08:27.994
To sort of, like,
read our mind or something.

1:08:28.012 --> 1:08:29.996
But sometimes
they can't do that, so, like,

1:08:30.014 --> 1:08:33.424
You need to talk
about your differences.

1:08:33.443 --> 1:08:34.776
Start from there.

1:08:34.927 --> 1:08:36.594
Communication
is very important.

1:08:36.613 --> 1:08:39.172
And then maybe
it will help that...

1:08:39.190 --> 1:08:41.098
- Mm-hmm.
- To grow...

1:08:41.192 --> 1:08:43.284
- Yeah.
- To get better.

1:08:43.436 --> 1:08:44.193
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

1:08:44.346 --> 1:08:46.604
- The problem for me is, like,

1:08:46.623 --> 1:08:48.606
I'm not usually
a touchy-feely person.

1:08:48.625 --> 1:08:50.274
I don't,
when in a relationship,

1:08:50.293 --> 1:08:52.201
Don't like pda.

1:08:52.295 --> 1:08:53.944
- He loves it.

1:08:53.964 --> 1:08:56.873
And he tells me
that he's mostly

1:08:56.967 --> 1:08:58.024
Drawn to women
that are more affectionate,

1:08:58.117 --> 1:09:01.210
That initiate physical touch,

1:09:01.304 --> 1:09:05.531
Because then it's easy for him
to respond and reciprocate.

1:09:05.550 --> 1:09:05.974
- I'm trying to figure out
what she can give me

1:09:06.125 --> 1:09:08.868
To make me--

1:09:08.887 --> 1:09:10.628
- Okay, tell me a little bit
more about her.

1:09:10.647 --> 1:09:12.796
Then maybe, you know,
we can try to brainstorm ideas

1:09:12.891 --> 1:09:14.223
Of things to do, you know?

1:09:14.376 --> 1:09:15.725
- She says she likes cooking.

1:09:15.877 --> 1:09:18.044
- For me, I'm acts of service

1:09:18.062 --> 1:09:21.230
And gifts.

1:09:21.383 --> 1:09:23.216
And I combine those
by baking and cooking.

1:09:23.309 --> 1:09:26.886
It's my way of showing this is
how I want to take care of you.

1:09:26.905 --> 1:09:29.146
- How often do you cook?
Do you cook every day?

1:09:29.166 --> 1:09:30.406
- Oh, man, no.

1:09:30.558 --> 1:09:31.815
I wish I had more time to cook.

1:09:31.835 --> 1:09:34.410
- We've cooked one time,
and we haven't cooked since.

1:09:34.562 --> 1:09:36.913
- Maybe you make time for it.

1:09:37.065 --> 1:09:39.399
Or, like, you know, you make
a little friendly move, like--

1:09:39.492 --> 1:09:42.660
- What would that even entail?

1:09:42.754 --> 1:09:44.904
- You could hold her hand.

1:09:44.997 --> 1:09:47.665
Get a little closer to her.
What she--

1:09:47.684 --> 1:09:48.850
It sounds like
what she's waiting for

1:09:49.077 --> 1:09:49.909
Is for you to make
the move, right?

1:09:50.002 --> 1:09:51.502
So just make the move.
- She is.

1:09:51.596 --> 1:09:53.521
- You ain't shy. Make the move.

1:09:53.673 --> 1:09:55.023
'cause maybe she needs that
reassurance from you.

1:09:55.174 --> 1:09:58.084
You know?
- Yeah.

1:09:58.102 --> 1:09:59.752
- 'cause you don't want to
walk away from this

1:09:59.771 --> 1:10:01.604
And say, "I didn't try.

1:10:01.698 --> 1:10:03.198
I didn't do everything
that I could," right?

1:10:03.425 --> 1:10:04.866
- Mm-hmm.
- You want to make sure

1:10:05.017 --> 1:10:06.759
That you're always doing
everything that you can

1:10:06.778 --> 1:10:08.277
So that when you
make that final decision,

1:10:08.430 --> 1:10:09.929
It's the right one, you know?

1:10:09.948 --> 1:10:11.597
<i> - It's just a challenge.</i>
<i> And if you can</i>

1:10:11.691 --> 1:10:13.783

1:10:13.877 --> 1:10:17.453
- Hopefully it'll be
smooth sailing after?

1:10:17.605 --> 1:10:19.697
- I believe in that.

1:10:19.791 --> 1:10:21.457
I can see that.

1:10:21.609 --> 1:10:22.942
But it's gonna take some work,

1:10:23.035 --> 1:10:26.054
And you can't just expect,
like, magic.

1:10:26.281 --> 1:10:28.781
It's gonna take some time.
- Yeah.

1:11:20.426 --> 1:11:23.336

Or falling in like
with your partner?

1:11:45.468 --> 1:11:47.043
- I'll start.

1:11:47.195 --> 1:11:49.529
So I think I could
definitely see myself

1:11:49.547 --> 1:11:51.047
Getting to, like,
me loving michaela,

1:11:51.199 --> 1:11:52.807
Just because of
how she is as a person.

1:11:53.034 --> 1:11:54.550
She is literally
the most thoughtful person

1:11:54.702 --> 1:11:55.959
I've ever met in my life, yeah.

1:11:55.979 --> 1:11:58.037
I would literally do anything
for michaela, so...

1:11:58.130 --> 1:11:59.705
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Wow.

1:11:59.799 --> 1:12:01.649
- I already love zack,
and I've told him that.

1:12:01.876 --> 1:12:03.059
- Oh, my god.

1:12:03.153 --> 1:12:04.819

1:12:04.970 --> 1:12:07.213

1:12:07.231 --> 1:12:08.972
- That's--yeah, that big.
That's huge.

1:12:08.992 --> 1:12:11.050
- We've gone
through our conflicts.

1:12:11.069 --> 1:12:12.976
But now we're past it,
and it's, like,

1:12:13.071 --> 1:12:16.055
I do think that
they gave me my man,

1:12:16.148 --> 1:12:18.891
Like, the man for me,
and mine--

1:12:18.910 --> 1:12:21.911
To fit my personality
and I to fit his.

1:12:22.005 --> 1:12:23.821
And I love that about you.

1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:25.989

<i> - Seeing michaela and zack in</i>

1:12:30.663 --> 1:12:33.514

it was--it was awkward.

1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:37.167
"you know what, I love you,"

1:12:37.187 --> 1:12:39.002
You know, that's great to see.

1:12:39.022 --> 1:12:40.746
- It feels refreshing to see
that they worked it out

1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:42.582
And they talked about it,
and so I'm very happy

1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:43.691
That they're in this place
right now.

1:12:43.843 --> 1:12:44.600
- Jose and rachel?

1:12:44.752 --> 1:12:46.268
- So right after the barbecue

1:12:46.363 --> 1:12:49.680
Is when I decided to tell jose

1:12:49.699 --> 1:12:50.865
That I loved him.

1:12:51.016 --> 1:12:52.425
That night, we were just,
like, on the couch.

1:12:52.443 --> 1:12:55.277
You know, we had such
a great time that day

1:12:55.372 --> 1:12:58.114
And just felt like, "oh,
we hosted our first party,"

1:12:58.208 --> 1:12:59.690
And it just felt comfortable,

1:12:59.709 --> 1:13:01.542
And it was the right time
to say it.

1:13:01.769 --> 1:13:04.879
And then, like,
fast-forward a week in,

1:13:05.106 --> 1:13:07.957
Y'all know what happened.
We hit a low, you know?

1:13:08.051 --> 1:13:08.791
And I thought it was gonna be

1:13:08.885 --> 1:13:10.367
Really hard to get over it,

1:13:10.387 --> 1:13:13.388
But immediately,
I fell back in love.

1:13:13.539 --> 1:13:17.967
Like, I felt immediately safe
and comfortable and secure,

1:13:18.119 --> 1:13:18.968
And I'm glad that happened.

1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:20.561
And we're in
a really good spot.

1:13:20.713 --> 1:13:22.121
- I was watching
him the whole time

1:13:22.140 --> 1:13:23.547
You were talking,
and he was literally--

1:13:23.641 --> 1:13:24.882
Like, what you just said,

1:13:24.901 --> 1:13:26.959
I can tell how much
it means to him.

1:13:26.978 --> 1:13:28.144
- Yeah, I can definitely say,
like,

1:13:28.296 --> 1:13:29.462
We're totally in love,

1:13:29.555 --> 1:13:30.312

1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:58.277

1:15:58.296 --> 1:16:01.630
To say I'm in love,
I wouldn't say that,

1:16:01.724 --> 1:16:04.225
But I'm definitely
falling in love with her.

1:16:04.452 --> 1:16:07.469
Everything about her
is special, is unique.

1:16:07.564 --> 1:16:11.232
She's a very unique princess.

1:16:11.459 --> 1:16:13.142
- [chuckles]

1:16:13.294 --> 1:16:15.144
- You know, my younger self

1:16:15.238 --> 1:16:17.296
Probably wouldn't have
put up with my wife.

1:16:17.389 --> 1:16:18.981
I would probably
have been like,

1:16:19.133 --> 1:16:20.800
"you're way too much, I'm out."

1:16:20.818 --> 1:16:23.986
I know what I want,
and what's more important

1:16:24.138 --> 1:16:26.396
Is, you know,
trying to grow with somebody,

1:16:26.490 --> 1:16:28.307
And because we want
the same thing,

1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:29.975
It makes it
a little bit easier.

1:16:29.994 --> 1:16:32.086
So I know--that's how
I know I'm in the road

1:16:32.313 --> 1:16:33.921
Of falling in love
with her, so--

1:16:34.073 --> 1:16:37.407
- "on the road,"
this dude's in love.

1:16:37.427 --> 1:16:39.927
- Facts, [bleep].
- "on the road"?

1:16:40.154 --> 1:16:44.323
- I made the choice
to love my husband.

1:16:44.342 --> 1:16:46.100
So much good in his heart.

1:16:46.251 --> 1:16:48.160
I think everything that
I imagined a husband would be,

1:16:48.253 --> 1:16:50.830
He's just, like--like,
an extra step above that,

1:16:50.848 --> 1:16:52.255
And I never thought
that would be possible.

1:16:52.350 --> 1:16:55.943
And because of that, I feel
so special every single day.

1:16:56.170 --> 1:16:57.686
I feel like a little princess
when I'm with him.

1:16:57.839 --> 1:16:59.338
- My dude.
- Yeah.

1:16:59.357 --> 1:17:00.689
- And so for that reason,
I think it's--

1:17:00.842 --> 1:17:02.174
You know, it's a process.

1:17:02.193 --> 1:17:04.009
Like, you make choices
to love someone,

1:17:04.028 --> 1:17:07.363
And I think, over time,
we'll grow that love.

1:17:07.515 --> 1:17:09.439
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice.

1:17:09.459 --> 1:17:12.776
- Bao, you're up.

1:17:12.870 --> 1:17:17.131
- I feel like I'm still
growing in like with johnny.

1:17:17.358 --> 1:17:20.301
And I feel like
I really have been trying.

1:17:20.452 --> 1:17:22.136
I'm giving it my all.

1:17:22.363 --> 1:17:24.530
I meal prep, I cook,
