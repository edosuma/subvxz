00:03.413 --> 00:05.171
My flat's been broken into.
I have to go.

00:05.172 --> 00:10.275
All these girls come onto him.
He knocks them all back.
Come over and watch a DVD.

00:10.275 --> 00:12.074
It's cos you want
to get in my knickers, right?

00:12.111 --> 00:13.231
I'll settle for a kiss.

00:13.232 --> 00:14.830
I've got another power.

00:14.831 --> 00:16.791
A power to bring people
back from the dead.

00:16.792 --> 00:18.950
It's like a zombie film.

00:18.951 --> 00:22.190
I'm Lola.
I'm a trainee probation worker.

00:22.191 --> 00:23.191
You don't act like one.

00:23.192 --> 00:25.550
Maybe I only want to be
a probation worker

00:25.551 --> 00:26.911
so I can meet bad boys.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.431
I love you.

01:13.631 --> 01:14.950
What's that?

01:14.951 --> 01:17.390
I said I love you.

01:31.751 --> 01:32.631
What is it?

01:32.632 --> 01:34.190
I need some fresh air.

01:34.191 --> 01:34.911
Are you OK?

01:34.912 --> 01:36.630
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:36.631 --> 01:38.510
Get some drinks.

01:49.471 --> 01:51.111
Same again?

01:52.111 --> 01:53.591
Curtis?

02:03.471 --> 02:04.671
Where did you go?

02:06.671 --> 02:08.231
What happened to you?

02:10.231 --> 02:11.830
Where have you been?

02:11.831 --> 02:14.390
What do you want, Jake?

02:14.391 --> 02:17.470
I can't stop
thinking about that guy.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.550
I never asked you to kill him.

02:19.551 --> 02:22.790
I did it for you.
I, I was trying to protect you.

02:22.791 --> 02:24.711
And for a while you got to fuck me.

02:26.391 --> 02:28.790
I thought you understood
the arrangement.

02:28.791 --> 02:30.191
An arrangement?

02:32.151 --> 02:34.590
Why are you being like this?
I love you.

02:34.591 --> 02:36.630
Go home, Jake.

02:36.631 --> 02:38.071
You're not walking away from this.

02:39.271 --> 02:42.590
If I go down, I'll take you with me.
I'll tell them everything.

02:42.591 --> 02:43.711
Are you threatening me?

02:43.712 --> 02:44.990
You used me.

02:44.991 --> 02:46.870
You bitch.

02:46.871 --> 02:48.190
You fucking bitch!

02:48.191 --> 02:50.310
You want to hurt me?

02:50.311 --> 02:51.311
Do it.

02:53.751 --> 02:55.031
You wouldn't be the first.

02:56.271 --> 02:57.711
Fuck you.

03:18.671 --> 03:20.391
Lola?

03:21.511 --> 03:22.551
Jesus. What happened?

03:24.911 --> 03:25.911
He attacked me.

04:14.631 --> 04:16.550
Lola?

04:16.551 --> 04:17.831
Are you OK?

04:22.791 --> 04:24.071
You want to tell me who he is?

04:26.151 --> 04:27.391
He's my ex.

04:28.951 --> 04:30.431
We used to see each other.

04:33.871 --> 04:35.271
He's obsessed with me.

04:36.511 --> 04:38.870
Every time I try and leave him,
he finds me.

04:38.871 --> 04:40.550
He doesn't own you.

04:40.551 --> 04:42.351
He says if I don't go back to him...

04:45.111 --> 04:47.430
he says he's going to kill me.

04:47.431 --> 04:49.310
You have to go to the police,

04:49.311 --> 04:50.710
report him.

04:50.711 --> 04:53.430
I went to the police before.
They didn't do anything.

04:53.431 --> 04:55.910
They just made it worse.

04:55.911 --> 04:58.271
I'm so fucking scared.

04:59.951 --> 05:02.231
Shhh. Shhh.

05:04.511 --> 05:06.510
I won't let him hurt you.

05:06.511 --> 05:08.751
I'm not going to let that happen.

05:23.151 --> 05:24.471
Finn! Finn!

05:25.511 --> 05:26.511
Finley!

05:28.111 --> 05:30.710
What? What? What is it?
What's happening?

05:30.711 --> 05:32.310
Have you got any jelly?

05:32.311 --> 05:33.391
Have I got any jelly?

05:33.392 --> 05:34.430
Yeah.

05:34.431 --> 05:36.071
What for?
What do you need jelly for?

05:36.072 --> 05:38.670
Well I would've thought
that was pretty friggin' obvious.

05:38.671 --> 05:39.871
Check that out.

05:39.872 --> 05:40.991
Hi.

05:42.431 --> 05:43.511
Are you gonna...?

05:43.512 --> 05:45.790
Yeah. Repeatedly,
have you got any jelly or not?

05:45.791 --> 05:46.990
No.

05:46.991 --> 05:48.191
Shit, that's a shame.

05:48.192 --> 05:50.710
Right, well I'll see you,
on the flip side.

05:50.711 --> 05:52.310
See ya up top.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.990
Come on?

05:53.991 --> 05:56.030
There's no jelly, love.

05:56.031 --> 05:58.390
Oh, my giddy...
I'm having a stroke.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.470
I'm having it, I'm having it.

06:00.471 --> 06:02.309
Cos I've died
and gone to frigging heaven.

06:02.310 --> 06:03.751
Knock, knock. Who's there?

06:03.752 --> 06:05.271
It's my cock.

06:13.951 --> 06:16.029
How would you like it
if I was bringing girls back

06:16.030 --> 06:17.509
and shagging them in front of you?

06:17.510 --> 06:18.551
I'd fucking love it.

06:19.871 --> 06:22.950
And what about her?
I'm sure she doesn't want me there.

06:22.951 --> 06:26.350
Eh, she's into all that
er, dogging.

06:26.351 --> 06:28.791
I used to think you had to own a dog
to take part in that shit.

06:28.792 --> 06:31.350
I made up this elaborate story
this one time, listen to this.

06:31.351 --> 06:33.231
About a cooker spaniel
by the name of Bobby,

06:33.232 --> 06:36.070
got crippling arthritis
in his back legs,

06:36.071 --> 06:37.630
had to have the bastards removed,

06:37.631 --> 06:39.750
replaced with a set of wheels.

06:39.751 --> 06:41.309
He was, he was loyal,
he was faithful

06:41.310 --> 06:43.631
and he got me more minge
than you could shake a stick at.

06:45.711 --> 06:47.390
I bloody miss that dog, you know.

06:47.391 --> 06:50.630
You're remembering he...
he didn't actually exist?

06:50.631 --> 06:53.110
Yeah, I know, but certain
slightly larger ladies

06:53.111 --> 06:55.870
that gather in certain designated
lay-bys and picnic areas.

06:55.871 --> 06:58.150
They did not know that.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.590
We need a system,
for when we bring girls back.

07:00.591 --> 07:02.911
Are you planning on doing that?
Dude, I just assumed

07:02.912 --> 07:06.590
your cock had withered
and shrivelled like a tiny raisin
in the hot Californian sun?

07:06.591 --> 07:08.950
There's no withering,
or shrivelling.

07:08.951 --> 07:12.030
I prefer to think of him
as a tiger.

07:12.031 --> 07:13.110
Really?

07:13.111 --> 07:15.431
Well he hasn't have fed for a while,
but he is poised,

07:15.432 --> 07:16.831
ready to pounce.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.750
I just need to find an angle.

07:20.751 --> 07:23.630
Right, here's your angle,
borrow Bobby.

07:23.631 --> 07:26.590
You're offering to lend me
your imaginary dog?

07:26.591 --> 07:27.669
Yes, I bloody well am.

07:27.670 --> 07:29.871
If you were any kind of man at all
you'd be over there

07:29.872 --> 07:33.191
telling her an heart-breaking story
about a little dog with arthritis.

07:46.191 --> 07:47.391
You OK?

07:49.471 --> 07:51.270
What?

07:51.271 --> 07:54.670
Wait, wait, talk slower.

07:54.671 --> 07:56.230
Where are you?

07:56.231 --> 07:57.551
No, just stay there.

08:03.311 --> 08:04.591
What is it?

08:07.351 --> 08:08.511
It came in the post.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.751
He knows where I work.

08:13.471 --> 08:14.869
I have to go away for a while.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.071
Where are you going to go?

08:16.072 --> 08:17.270
I don't know.

08:17.271 --> 08:19.631
Somewhere away from here,
anywhere he can't find me.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.590
What about us?

08:21.591 --> 08:23.870
If I stay, he'll hurt me.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.070
I have to go.

08:25.071 --> 08:29.150
You don't have to. I'll talk to him.

08:29.151 --> 08:31.390
I'll go and see him.

08:31.391 --> 08:33.630
I'll tell him you're with me now.

08:33.631 --> 08:35.631
You think he's going to listen to you?
I'll make him listen.

08:35.631 --> 08:37.510
No, no, no.

08:37.510 --> 08:39.750
You don't know what he's like.

08:39.751 --> 08:42.630
This one time we were in a bar.

08:42.631 --> 08:45.110
He thought this guy
was looking at me.

08:45.111 --> 08:46.750
He nearly beat him to death.

08:46.751 --> 08:49.790
If you go round there,
he'll kill you.

08:49.791 --> 08:52.431
I ain't going to lose you
cos of this prick.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.071
Where does he live?

09:00.351 --> 09:01.990
I bought it for protection.

09:01.991 --> 09:03.271
I ain't going round with no gun.

09:03.272 --> 09:06.430
If he hurt you
I'd never forgive myself.

09:06.431 --> 09:07.590
Take it.

09:07.591 --> 09:08.950
Please.

09:08.951 --> 09:11.511
I don't want you to get hurt.

09:25.751 --> 09:27.550
He'll lie.

09:27.551 --> 09:29.591
He'll try and turn you against me.

09:32.111 --> 09:33.271
Whatever he says to you...

09:35.951 --> 09:37.071
you can't trust him.

09:46.391 --> 09:47.391
Sorry, I'm...

09:50.991 --> 09:52.071
Sorry?

09:53.271 --> 09:54.590
I was just...

09:54.591 --> 09:56.150
Sorry.

09:56.151 --> 09:58.150
I'm not much company.

09:58.151 --> 09:59.191
What's going on?

09:59.192 --> 10:01.870
Me nan's dog. Bobby.

10:01.871 --> 10:04.470
He had his back legs
amputated yesterday.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.710
Seriously?

10:05.711 --> 10:07.670
Yeah, they just chopped them off,

10:07.671 --> 10:09.671
replaced them with a set of wheels.

10:13.671 --> 10:15.750
Do you want to go
for a drink at the bar later?

10:15.751 --> 10:17.350
I'm not going to the bar.

10:17.351 --> 10:19.830
I don't want to see Alex,
the barman guy.

10:19.831 --> 10:23.270
Right. Good. What a wanker.

10:23.271 --> 10:24.630
Maybe a bit harsh.

10:24.631 --> 10:26.871
I really need someone to talk to
about little Bobby.

10:26.872 --> 10:30.150
I'm not being funny
but I'm probably not the best person
to talk to about dogs.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.990
I hate them,
shitting all over the place and...

10:32.991 --> 10:34.830
I hate the shitting.

10:34.831 --> 10:39.431
Fuckin' shitting little Bobby with
his squeaky little wheels just...

10:42.831 --> 10:44.950
They should just put him down.

10:44.951 --> 10:48.350
Can't you just oil the wheels
to stop them from squeaking?

10:48.351 --> 10:51.191
Well that would be
the humane thing to do.

11:34.031 --> 11:35.670
Take whatever you want.

11:35.671 --> 11:37.951
I ain't here to rob you.

11:39.831 --> 11:41.151
I'm here cos of Lola.

11:42.591 --> 11:46.150
You don't go anywhere near her.
You don't call her.

11:46.151 --> 11:48.390
You don't send her no photos.

11:48.391 --> 11:49.990
If she even sees you.

11:49.991 --> 11:52.270
You even think about hurting her,

11:52.271 --> 11:54.510
I'll fucking kill you.
You hearing me?

11:54.511 --> 11:55.429
I'd never hurt her.

11:55.430 --> 11:56.669
I saw what you did to her.

11:56.670 --> 11:58.511
You're a big man, beating up women.

11:58.512 --> 12:00.831
I didn't touch her.
I wouldn't do that.

12:03.151 --> 12:04.670
Don't lie to me!

12:04.671 --> 12:07.151
I wouldn't hurt her! I love her!

12:09.191 --> 12:12.910
Whatever she told you about me,
she's lying.

12:12.911 --> 12:14.871
She's using you.

13:02.351 --> 13:03.591
What happened?

13:10.431 --> 13:11.791
Are you hurt?

13:13.191 --> 13:14.271
It isn't my blood.

13:15.351 --> 13:17.310
Curtis, what happened?

13:17.311 --> 13:18.911
We got into a fight.

13:20.791 --> 13:21.791
He's dead.

13:29.831 --> 13:32.230
What did he say to you?

13:32.231 --> 13:33.950
He said you were using me.

13:33.951 --> 13:35.350
And do you believe him?

13:35.351 --> 13:37.391
I don't know what to believe.

13:40.271 --> 13:41.391
I killed him.

13:42.791 --> 13:44.071
He's fucking dead.

13:45.871 --> 13:47.791
He would have killed both of us.

13:49.671 --> 13:51.591
You did what you had to do.

13:52.591 --> 13:53.831
He can't hurt me anymore.

14:26.122 --> 14:27.442
Lola?

15:03.542 --> 15:04.982
It's me. Where are you?

15:06.102 --> 15:07.702
I'm worried about you.

15:08.822 --> 15:10.142
Call me, yeah?

15:14.542 --> 15:16.021
Who is it?

15:16.022 --> 15:17.342
No-one.

15:27.102 --> 15:32.260
I'm looking for Lola.
Is she coming in today?

15:32.261 --> 15:33.462
I really wouldn't know.

15:33.463 --> 15:35.501
Do you know where she is?

15:35.502 --> 15:39.061
No. And shall I tell you why
I don't know where she is?

15:39.062 --> 15:43.421
Because I've no fucking idea
who you're talking about.

15:43.422 --> 15:45.702
Lola. The trainee probation worker.

15:47.702 --> 15:49.782
There is no trainee
probation worker.

15:53.582 --> 15:54.500
Are you on crack?

15:54.501 --> 15:56.262
What?!
Have you been hitting the pipe?

15:56.263 --> 15:58.101
I ain't on no crack.

15:58.102 --> 16:00.062
So what the fuck are you talking about?
Nothing.

16:01.382 --> 16:02.502
Forget it.

16:04.302 --> 16:06.381
Fucking crack head.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.221
I can't be walking in on you
with some girl sitting on your face.

16:09.222 --> 16:12.141
Shit, man. Did you know
they ejaculate?

16:12.142 --> 16:15.301
Honestly, mate, the bloody female
genitalia, it's like a...

16:15.302 --> 16:19.061
It's like a mystery,
wrapped in an hairy conundrum.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.102
This stops now.

16:20.103 --> 16:22.861
Honestly, mate, do not
get that shit in your eye.

16:22.862 --> 16:24.501
It stings like a proper bastard.

16:24.502 --> 16:25.182
Quick question.

16:25.183 --> 16:26.821
Uh-huh.

16:26.822 --> 16:28.142
So, you're sitting
on a bloke's face...

16:28.143 --> 16:29.181
Hmm?

16:29.182 --> 16:32.381
Would you be offended if he insisted
on wearing the safety goggles?

16:32.382 --> 16:35.301
Why would he be wearing
safety goggles? Is he a scientist?

16:35.302 --> 16:37.101
He's been shagging a squirter.

16:37.102 --> 16:39.301
Ejaculate.

16:39.302 --> 16:40.220
What about it?

16:40.221 --> 16:40.902
Avoid the eyes.

16:40.903 --> 16:43.541
Has any of you seen Lola?

16:43.542 --> 16:46.221
The trainee probation worker.

16:46.222 --> 16:49.141
Do we have a trainee
probation worker?

16:49.142 --> 16:51.181
Nobody tells me anything.

16:51.182 --> 16:52.701
I'm outside the loop.

16:52.702 --> 16:56.781
Shush. Listen, if she's cute...
Dude, I saw her first, so legally,

16:56.782 --> 16:57.940
that is first dibs.

16:57.941 --> 17:00.741
You don't even know who I'm talking about.
Yeah, I do.

17:00.742 --> 17:03.221
I don't. Don't have a fucking clue.
Sorry, man.

17:03.222 --> 17:05.941
The other day, you...
You saw me with her in the bar.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.862
I saw you with some girl.
I've never seen her before.

17:07.863 --> 17:09.621
She works here.

17:09.622 --> 17:10.661
Does she?

17:10.662 --> 17:13.541
I didn't even know we had
a trainee probation worker.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.621
Are you all right?

17:16.622 --> 17:19.021
Yeah. Forget it.

17:21.942 --> 17:24.462
I think Curtis is in trouble.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.741
Curtis!

18:35.742 --> 18:38.501
Curtis, mate, we know you're
in there. We followed you.

18:38.502 --> 18:41.701
Open this door or I am going
to huff and puff

18:41.702 --> 18:43.381
and kick the frigging door down.

18:43.382 --> 18:45.501
C...Curtis!

18:45.502 --> 18:47.261
Curtis Donovan!

18:47.262 --> 18:48.901
Open this bloody door immediately.

18:48.902 --> 18:52.141
Shut the fuck up and stop shouting my name.
Why?

18:52.142 --> 18:53.780
What are you ashamed
of your name for?

18:53.781 --> 18:56.262
There's far worse names.
There's a kid at my school

18:56.263 --> 18:57.622
called Richard Cheese.

18:58.742 --> 19:02.221
Dick Cheese, innit?
Cos his name's Richard...

19:02.222 --> 19:04.182
Richard Dick...

19:05.982 --> 19:07.422
Dick Cheese.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.342
So, what's occurring?

19:15.582 --> 19:18.181
I'm sure there's a very funny
story behind this.

19:18.182 --> 19:20.941
And I don't mean...

19:20.942 --> 19:25.062
I don't mean funny
like ha-ha-ha funny, I mean...

19:26.542 --> 19:28.822
In your own time, please, mate.

19:32.262 --> 19:32.942
I killed him.

19:32.943 --> 19:36.461
Shit. That's why you didn't
want me one shouting your name.

19:36.462 --> 19:39.062
Consider me up to speed.
Sorry, dude.

19:47.942 --> 19:49.981
I wake up this morning,

19:49.982 --> 19:51.501
Lola's gone.

19:51.502 --> 19:54.261
I talk to all you
and the probation worker.

19:54.262 --> 19:57.181
None of you even know who she is.

19:57.182 --> 20:00.781
This guy's the only other person
who knows anything about her.

20:00.782 --> 20:03.182
You're going to bring him
back to life, aren't you?

20:03.183 --> 20:06.621
No! I do not like that, man.
He'll go all zombie on us.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.100
You know what happened
last time, pal.

20:08.101 --> 20:09.342
What happened last time?

20:09.343 --> 20:12.821
We had to kill a shit load
of cheerleaders. And a cat!

20:12.822 --> 20:14.342
I feel so bad about
the cat still.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.421
I'll ask him a few questions
and then...

20:16.422 --> 20:19.781
It's the only way
I can find out who she is.

20:19.782 --> 20:22.941
All right. Gentlemen, would you like
to join me in the kitchen, please?

20:22.942 --> 20:23.382
What's going on?

20:23.383 --> 20:27.621
It's just man talk. We shall keep
you but a moment, sweetheart.

20:27.622 --> 20:28.622
Gentlemen, shall we, please?

20:28.623 --> 20:29.942
Such a twat.

20:33.902 --> 20:35.301
What do you want?

20:35.302 --> 20:36.501
Right.

20:36.502 --> 20:40.381
What's your thoughts on letting
the little fella do the clubbing?

20:40.382 --> 20:41.342
"The little fella"?

20:41.343 --> 20:43.901
He's just getting nowhere
with Mary Poppins there.

20:43.902 --> 20:47.101
I just think if she sees him
clubbing some dude to death,

20:47.102 --> 20:50.342
maybe she won't think that he's such
a complete pussy. Look at him.

20:51.382 --> 20:53.261
It's pathetic.

20:53.262 --> 20:55.261
Help him out. Come on.

20:55.262 --> 20:56.942
You're sure you're up to this?

20:58.382 --> 21:00.702
You think I can't
club a zombie to death?

21:02.302 --> 21:05.381
You know the little thing at the fun
fair with the little furry creatures

21:05.382 --> 21:07.941
that pop out of the holes and
you have to pop, pop, pop, pop?

21:07.942 --> 21:09.021
Hmm?

21:09.022 --> 21:10.302
Well, I'm a machine.

21:13.302 --> 21:14.461
Shall we?

21:14.462 --> 21:15.662
We shall.

21:20.662 --> 21:21.822
Mmmm.

21:26.382 --> 21:28.622
You do know you have
to destroy the brain, right?

21:28.623 --> 21:29.981
Of course I know.

21:29.982 --> 21:32.821
Er, I'm not being funny,
but is he doing the clubbing?

21:32.822 --> 21:36.021
Yes. I'm doing the clubbing.
Is that a problem?

21:36.022 --> 21:38.901
You know the chipmunks at the fair?

21:38.902 --> 21:40.982
He's a machine.
Don't worry about it.

21:42.462 --> 21:43.541
Ready?

21:43.542 --> 21:44.782
Ready when you are.

21:59.382 --> 22:00.822
You...

22:02.502 --> 22:04.061
You shot me.

22:04.062 --> 22:05.381
You died. I...

22:05.382 --> 22:07.422
I brought you back to life.

22:08.662 --> 22:10.421
What the fuck?

22:10.422 --> 22:13.781
Will somebody tell me
what the fuck is going on?

22:13.782 --> 22:16.341
I didn't mean to kill you.
It all got fucked up.

22:16.342 --> 22:17.981
I need to talk to you about Lola.

22:17.982 --> 22:21.421
You resurrected me? Seriously?!

22:21.422 --> 22:23.820
Yeah, he's got a power, hasn't he?
It's the storm, mate.

22:23.821 --> 22:24.702
It's always the storm.

22:24.703 --> 22:27.342
I need you to tell me about Lola.

22:28.702 --> 22:29.702
Tell me!

22:30.902 --> 22:33.941
We started seeing each other.

22:33.942 --> 22:37.861
She was in debt with
some loan shark. He beat her up.

22:37.862 --> 22:40.141
He really hurt her. I lost it.

22:40.142 --> 22:43.101
I stabbed him.
I didn't mean to kill him.

22:43.102 --> 22:44.941
And then she disappeared.

22:44.942 --> 22:47.222
She was using me.

22:50.622 --> 22:53.261
Do you know where she lives?

22:53.262 --> 22:55.261
Where does she live?

22:55.262 --> 22:58.301
She had a flat in High Hill.

22:58.302 --> 23:00.421
What number?

23:00.422 --> 23:02.301
Do you hear that?

23:02.302 --> 23:03.341
What is that?

23:03.342 --> 23:04.901
What number flat is it?

23:04.902 --> 23:06.102
68.

23:07.262 --> 23:10.221
Can you hear that?
I feel really weird.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.301
I know you do, mate. And here's
the kicker. You're a zombie.

23:13.302 --> 23:14.342
What's going on?

23:14.343 --> 23:16.061
Nothing.

23:16.062 --> 23:20.101
A zombie, huh? Now there's something
that doesn't happen every day.

23:20.102 --> 23:21.621
What do you mean, I'm a zombie?

23:21.622 --> 23:23.982
No, don't sweat it.
We're going to fix that for you.

23:23.983 --> 23:29.021
Will somebody tell me,
what the fuck is going on?!

23:29.022 --> 23:32.101
Dickhead, where's the fucking light?

23:32.102 --> 23:33.861
Ow! That's me!

23:33.862 --> 23:35.022
Sorry, sorry. I thought it was him!

23:35.023 --> 23:36.621
Where is he?

23:36.622 --> 23:39.141
He's on me! Fucking get him off me!

23:39.142 --> 23:40.502
Where are you?
Get the lights!

23:40.503 --> 23:42.142
I can't see the fucking lights!

23:44.262 --> 23:47.581
I'm all right. I'm all right,
Everyone just shut up.

23:47.582 --> 23:49.902
Just calm the fuck down.
Everyone just shut up.

23:54.622 --> 23:56.181
Did we get him?

23:56.182 --> 23:58.142
Where the fuck's he gone?

24:14.422 --> 24:17.861
Oh, well done, mate. Brilliant, eh?

24:17.862 --> 24:21.821
Woah. Woah. All right! Bloody hell.
Boy done good...

24:21.822 --> 24:25.142
Eh? Get in there.
Get on one of them. Spring bet.

24:26.902 --> 24:30.381
All things considering,
I just think that went really well.

24:30.382 --> 24:31.622
Didn't it, eh?

24:32.902 --> 24:34.981
Are we going for a beer or what?

24:34.982 --> 24:36.381
I have to go.

24:36.382 --> 24:39.821
Are you going round there now?
Do you want us to come with you?

24:39.822 --> 24:41.221
No, you're all right.

24:41.222 --> 24:44.461
No problem. Anytime.
Just happy to help.

24:44.462 --> 24:47.301
What about you two? Do you want
to come for a beer? He's paying.

24:47.302 --> 24:48.782
I'm going home for a shower.

24:48.783 --> 24:51.061
Hmmm. Two people...

24:51.062 --> 24:53.181
both in need of a shower.

24:53.182 --> 24:54.420
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

24:54.421 --> 24:56.262
I doubt it because
we're not really...

24:56.263 --> 24:58.781
You weren't thinking
soapy tit wank? Come on!

24:58.782 --> 25:00.541
No. Yeah. No.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.020
I find that very strange.

25:02.021 --> 25:02.902
I'm going now.

25:02.903 --> 25:04.862
You were thinking that. She was.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.621
You prick.

25:07.622 --> 25:09.382
Dude, I'm sorry. Dude.

26:02.111 --> 26:05.010
Mmm, that is good toast.

26:05.148 --> 26:07.587
It's all about the butter
distribution.

26:07.588 --> 26:10.947
I hate these tossers who just stick
a big lump of butter in the middle.

26:10.948 --> 26:13.067
What do they think the knife's for?
Spread it.

26:13.068 --> 26:15.747
You need to get it
right to the edges.

26:15.748 --> 26:17.348
Morning, my lovelies!

26:18.948 --> 26:20.148
Oh.

26:23.548 --> 26:29.188
Shit, is that - that's not
marmalade, is it?
What?

26:29.189 --> 26:30.868
It's just that yesterday...

26:32.268 --> 26:34.147
afternoon, tea-time

26:34.148 --> 26:36.987
I might have stuck my cock in that.

26:36.988 --> 26:40.667
The things we do for love. Eh?
I tell you what.

26:40.711 --> 26:41.710
I feel sick.

26:41.711 --> 26:45.070
I'm sure we'll laugh about this one
day. No, she's gone. She's gone,
dude.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.750
Hey, listen, Emma the dogger,
right, she says to me,

26:47.751 --> 26:50.870
"I fancy something sweet."
All right, so I said...

26:50.871 --> 26:54.430
"I just put my cock in Finn's
marmalade and you can suck on that."

26:54.431 --> 26:57.910
Yes, very good, mate. Yes!
It's like you're psychic!

26:57.911 --> 27:01.030
I am never,
ever playing you at Battleships.

27:01.031 --> 27:06.230
Thank you very much. Jess loved my
toast. My even butter distribution.

27:06.231 --> 27:09.310
And now it will forever be
associated

27:09.311 --> 27:11.070
with the taste of your cock.

27:11.071 --> 27:13.910
You've... You've completely
fucked it.

27:13.911 --> 27:15.391
I hate to break it to you

27:15.392 --> 27:18.430
but the way to a girl's heart
is not through toast.

27:18.431 --> 27:22.910
It's through inserting your penis
into her vagina, mate.

27:22.911 --> 27:26.390
Fuckin' toast. Dude, honestly,
I'm embarrassed for you, moron.

27:26.391 --> 27:27.390
That's it.

27:27.391 --> 27:30.671
T-T-That's it. You're gonna have to
find somewhere else to live.

27:33.111 --> 27:35.030
Wait.

27:35.031 --> 27:37.469
What, so are you breaking up
with me, or something?

27:37.470 --> 27:38.671
I can't live like this.

27:38.672 --> 27:40.271
Mate, don't do this. This...

27:42.711 --> 27:46.710
It reminds me of when my dad's
parrot Bernie called my mum a cunt,
one year.

27:46.711 --> 27:49.030
And they fell out big time, big row.

27:49.031 --> 27:53.110
And they cancelled
Christmas and everything.
I wet my bed for a year, pal.

27:53.111 --> 27:54.870
We want different things.

27:54.871 --> 27:55.950
I just...

27:55.951 --> 27:58.870
thought we had something
special going on.

27:58.871 --> 28:00.031
We can still be friends.

28:00.032 --> 28:01.550
No, we can't still be friends!

28:01.551 --> 28:03.670
Because you've made a fool of me,
pal!

28:03.671 --> 28:05.790
You know, I don't want to live
with you either.

28:05.791 --> 28:08.271
No, I don't!
I'm gonna find me own place to live,

28:08.272 --> 28:10.590
it's gonna be like Christmas
every day.

28:10.591 --> 28:13.271
Jerk! Shit!

29:09.511 --> 29:13.910
My mum died when I was 15.
My dad went to pieces.

29:13.911 --> 29:15.870
He took it out on me.

29:15.871 --> 29:20.110
When I couldn't take the beatings
any more, I ran away.

29:20.111 --> 29:24.430
I met this guy, Jimmy.
I thought he loved me.

29:24.431 --> 29:26.830
Then he started pimping me out.

29:26.831 --> 29:29.150
If I said no, he'd hurt me.

29:29.151 --> 29:34.790
I didn't have anywhere else to go.
Then something inside me snapped.

29:34.791 --> 29:37.030
I seduced this dealer.

29:37.031 --> 29:39.870
I got him to cut Jimmy's smack
with rat poison.

29:39.871 --> 29:44.031
I sat there and I watched Jimmy die.

29:45.551 --> 29:48.551
I decided I was never going to be
a victim ever again.

29:49.631 --> 29:52.510
I would use men like they used me.

29:52.511 --> 29:58.270
Fuck them, tell them you love
them, they'll do anything for you.

29:58.271 --> 30:01.910
They are so fucking pathetic.

30:01.911 --> 30:05.990
And cut. Debbie, that was great.

30:05.991 --> 30:08.830
You really got inside the head
of the character.

30:08.831 --> 30:11.150
Take the DVD home with you.
Watch yourself.

30:11.151 --> 30:14.110
You've got to really want
to be Lola.

30:14.111 --> 30:15.151
OK. I'll try.

30:47.231 --> 30:49.270
Hello, Curtis.

30:49.271 --> 30:50.471
I saw the DVD.

30:52.591 --> 30:54.271
You're an actress.

30:55.551 --> 30:56.671
What are you talking about?

30:56.672 --> 30:57.950
All this.

30:57.951 --> 31:01.270
Who you are. It's an act.

31:01.271 --> 31:03.390
It was the storm.
You stayed in character.

31:03.391 --> 31:05.630
This isn't... This isn't you.

31:05.631 --> 31:10.591
You think you know me -
you don't know anything.

31:13.431 --> 31:16.830
It's on here. "Lola".

31:16.831 --> 31:19.191
That's your character's name.

31:20.351 --> 31:21.990
Are you trying to blackmail me?

31:21.991 --> 31:23.350
No.

31:23.351 --> 31:25.311
I didn't kill Jake. You did.

31:28.831 --> 31:32.230
Maybe I should go to the police.
I could tell them what you did.

31:32.231 --> 31:34.671
You're not listening to me!
I'm trying to help you!

31:34.672 --> 31:37.431
You killed a man, Curtis.
Can you live with that?

31:42.111 --> 31:44.910
You don't understand
what you did to me.

31:44.911 --> 31:47.591
I used you. Deal with it.

31:49.351 --> 31:51.311
I'll fucking kill you.

31:53.911 --> 31:55.311
Get away from me!

32:35.431 --> 32:38.750
Curtis. He found me.

32:38.751 --> 32:40.111
What did he do to you?

32:41.311 --> 32:42.431
Show me.

32:47.191 --> 32:48.711
I'm gonna kill him.

33:08.283 --> 33:09.923
What the fuck!

33:11.083 --> 33:15.403
Fucking horrible bastard!
Whoa, fucking hell.

33:17.123 --> 33:19.243
Fucking no way!

33:28.443 --> 33:30.562
What is it?

33:30.563 --> 33:33.002
My new room is crawling with slugs.

33:33.003 --> 33:36.202
And I think one's gone up my anus,
actually.

33:36.203 --> 33:39.202
I tried pouring
some salt down there.

33:39.203 --> 33:42.282
And I've really twisted,
me neck's killing.

33:42.283 --> 33:45.603
My arsehole stings like a bastard.

33:46.883 --> 33:49.282
I'm not sure it's designed
to have salt up it.

33:49.283 --> 33:51.802
Will you let me
move back in with you, please?

33:51.803 --> 33:53.882
I promise I'll behave myself.
I just, I just...

33:53.883 --> 33:55.763
I just can't sleep on my own.

33:58.963 --> 33:59.963
I miss you.

34:03.003 --> 34:04.201
I miss you too.

34:04.202 --> 34:04.963
Do you?

34:04.964 --> 34:06.202
Yeah.

34:06.203 --> 34:08.203
Buzzin'. Eh?

34:16.283 --> 34:18.723
Can you come and help me
shit this slug out, man?

34:18.724 --> 34:20.362
No.

34:34.563 --> 34:37.563
Man, don't look at me like that.
What, you think I like this?

34:39.322 --> 34:41.842
Fuck you. It's not my fault.

34:46.643 --> 34:47.681
What was that?

34:47.683 --> 34:49.161
What?

34:49.163 --> 34:52.243
There was a metallic bang,
followed by an animalistic squeak.

34:55.523 --> 35:02.442
That? Er, that was... that was me.

35:02.443 --> 35:06.323
Are you taking the piss?
You like to squeal?

35:07.603 --> 35:09.003
I'll make you squeal.

35:10.083 --> 35:13.762
I'll make you squeal
like you're a cute little piglet

35:13.763 --> 35:16.483
that's being raped by a bear.

35:18.523 --> 35:19.843
What was that?

35:23.923 --> 35:25.242
Were you sniffing me?

35:25.243 --> 35:29.803
Erm... I find you very attractive.

35:31.483 --> 35:35.962
You're so butch and angry.

35:35.963 --> 35:37.883
I like that.

35:46.283 --> 35:49.283
You're a very attractive young man,
but I'm your probation worker.

35:50.643 --> 35:52.723
Some things were just not
meant to be.

35:54.283 --> 35:56.443
It is a cruel and bitter world.

36:09.003 --> 36:11.283
Where are you,
you little shit, come on!

36:15.043 --> 36:16.923
Fuck! Oh, for... Fucking hell!

36:25.483 --> 36:28.363
Dude, you're a fucking zombie,
Curtis, shit!

36:31.163 --> 36:34.602
Shit, have you got any thoughts

36:34.603 --> 36:38.282
on how you might want to deal
with this one? Fuck!

36:38.283 --> 36:40.043
I've snacked up.

36:41.923 --> 36:43.121
I ain't gonna bite you.

36:43.122 --> 36:44.203
Are you sure, mate?

36:44.204 --> 36:45.203
I've fed.

36:49.723 --> 36:50.963
Shit!

36:54.923 --> 36:57.842
Curtis, man.
You're a fuckin' zombie.

36:57.843 --> 36:59.363
You can't tell the others.

37:00.403 --> 37:02.602
We're gonna have
to cave his skull in, guys.

37:02.603 --> 37:06.322
It's Curtis. We can't kill him.
There must be something we can do.

37:06.323 --> 37:09.482
That's what they said
about the Apollo 13 mission.

37:09.483 --> 37:11.922
No, wait, hang on.

37:11.923 --> 37:15.242
No, turns out there was,
there was something they could do.

37:15.243 --> 37:17.322
Which is why this, mate,

37:17.323 --> 37:21.602
our situation is nothing like
the Apollo 13 mission to the moon.

37:21.603 --> 37:22.643
It's far worse!

37:24.043 --> 37:26.323
Look, Curtis is a fuckin' mate.

37:27.843 --> 37:29.483
But what needs to be done...

37:31.483 --> 37:32.523
needs to be done.

37:32.524 --> 37:33.562
No. Nah.

37:33.563 --> 37:34.562
Yes.

37:34.563 --> 37:35.602
He's right.

37:35.603 --> 37:38.723
We have to kill him before
he infects us or someone else.

37:41.123 --> 37:43.882
It's either that or
we spend the rest of our short lives

37:43.883 --> 37:47.002
living in a post-apocalyptic,
zombie-infested nightmare world.

37:47.003 --> 37:48.963
And it's shit
enough around here as it is.

37:48.964 --> 37:52.882
So how do we do this? How do we
decide who does the skull-caving?

37:52.883 --> 37:56.402
Cos I done the last guy, so that's
my skull-caving done for the week.

37:56.403 --> 37:58.162
You're not pussying out of this.

37:58.163 --> 38:00.642
That's not what
I was trying to do. Not at all.

38:00.643 --> 38:04.322
Hey, not even a hint of pussy.

38:04.323 --> 38:07.363
Horrible, grievous...

38:08.683 --> 38:12.763
mate-killing situations like these
are exactly why God invented straws.

38:31.723 --> 38:33.163
I ain't gonna bite you.

38:35.723 --> 38:37.322
You tell the others?

38:37.323 --> 38:41.163
No. I'm shocked, mate,
that you would...

38:43.203 --> 38:44.723
They're gutted for you.

38:47.043 --> 38:49.443
The little fella's in bits.

38:53.763 --> 38:56.002
I can't stop thinking about Lola.

38:56.003 --> 38:58.522
I know I should be angry with her,

38:58.523 --> 39:01.403
but she doesn't know
what she's doing.

39:03.003 --> 39:06.802
That fuckin' storm.
I need to try and help her.

39:06.803 --> 39:09.042
Make her watch the DVD.

39:09.043 --> 39:12.923
I... I need to do something
while I still can.

39:15.643 --> 39:17.402
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

39:17.403 --> 39:19.682
I'm all right. I'm all right.

39:19.683 --> 39:22.482
Oho! Is that a hammer?

39:22.483 --> 39:26.282
What the bloody hell is that doing?
It's raining bloody hammers.

39:26.283 --> 39:28.483
Whatever next?! Fuck.

39:30.323 --> 39:34.643
Mate, it's nothing personal.
I drew the short straw, didn't I?

40:21.563 --> 40:23.243
Get out.

40:40.283 --> 40:44.683
Whatever she's told you about me,
it's bullshit.

40:45.883 --> 40:47.203
She's using you.

40:49.483 --> 40:50.803
I killed a guy for her.

40:52.123 --> 40:53.123
She tell you that?

40:54.243 --> 40:55.963
She didn't, did she?

41:05.003 --> 41:06.443
I'm gonna turn round.

41:13.323 --> 41:14.842
I just wanna talk.

41:14.843 --> 41:16.283
I saw what you did to her.

41:16.284 --> 41:20.762
I never touched her.
This isn't her. She's acting.

41:20.763 --> 41:23.801
She's playing a part. It was the storm.
You know about the storm?

41:23.802 --> 41:25.443
I'm not gonna let you
hurt her again.

41:25.444 --> 41:28.483
She's lying. She's using you.
I never hurt her.

41:38.603 --> 41:40.883
Oh, fuck. I can't do this.

41:46.723 --> 41:50.923
Don't do this.
This isn't who you are.

41:52.843 --> 41:54.443
Lola, you have to listen to me.

41:59.043 --> 42:01.242
You shot me?

42:01.243 --> 42:03.763
Curtis shot you.

42:05.043 --> 42:09.722
You shot each other, at least
that's how it's going to look.

42:09.723 --> 42:11.323
No!

42:55.203 --> 42:56.443
Curtis?

42:58.403 --> 43:00.243
I'm sorry.

43:16.563 --> 43:19.242
Hiya, mate. How you doin'?

43:19.243 --> 43:21.282
You mean apart from being a zombie?

43:21.283 --> 43:22.962
Fuck.

43:22.963 --> 43:25.283
He's still a zombie.

43:28.443 --> 43:32.802
Where are you, man? We'd,
we'd love to have a little chat,

43:32.803 --> 43:37.282
just... talk through these options,
eh?

43:37.283 --> 43:41.722
The way I see it,
there's only one option.

43:41.723 --> 43:45.562
I'm really sorry
it's come down to this, mate.

43:45.563 --> 43:48.122
None of us chose this shit.

43:48.123 --> 43:49.963
Are you sure we can't...

43:52.763 --> 43:55.442
manufacture some
sort of an happy ending?

43:55.443 --> 43:59.122
Cos you know,
you know I love them happy endings.

43:59.123 --> 44:00.883
There ain't no happy endings.

44:02.203 --> 44:04.562
It's zombie noir, innit?

44:04.563 --> 44:06.843
We could go for a pint.

44:09.043 --> 44:13.043
Just me and you,
two boring old fuckers
and talk about the good old days.

44:14.483 --> 44:17.362
We'll just have one last pint, eh?

44:17.363 --> 44:18.723
It's better this way.

44:22.283 --> 44:23.883
Take care of yourself, yeah?

45:16.323 --> 45:19.002
I was looking for Dan Woollaston.

45:19.003 --> 45:20.202
That's my dad.

45:20.203 --> 45:22.242
I think he might be my dad, too.

45:22.243 --> 45:26.162
Do you really think you
can have a relationship
with some guy you've never met?

45:26.163 --> 45:27.003
He's me dad.

45:27.004 --> 45:28.522
Tell me what we're doing here!

45:28.523 --> 45:30.522
This guy has got a date
with a friend of mine.

45:30.523 --> 45:32.882
And we're finding out if he's gay.

45:32.883 --> 45:34.082
Why?

45:34.083 --> 45:36.602
So I can completely destroy
his relationship with Jess

45:36.603 --> 45:40.162
before it's even started.
I think he's paying him for sex.

45:40.163 --> 45:42.083
There's something I need to ask you.

45:42.084 --> 45:44.402
Please don't fuck me sister.

45:44.403 --> 45:46.883
I'm genetically programmed
to fuck people's sisters.

45:46.884 --> 45:49.303
You think this is what I expected
when I went looking for me dad?!
