01:11.426 --> 01:12.525
Five!

01:12.754 --> 01:14.820
One, two, three, four, five.

01:14.993 --> 01:16.394
Fuel.

01:17.447 --> 01:18.461
Well?

01:18.462 --> 01:22.995
Mmmm...
What to do, what to do?

01:28.072 --> 01:31.001
Free fuel - get refill for free,
and throw again.

01:31.003 --> 01:32.503
Let's see.

01:34.664 --> 01:37.085
How come you keep
getting great cards?

01:37.087 --> 01:38.179
It's a mystery, isn't it?

01:38.180 --> 01:41.180
I've never been beaten
at Mineopoly, Lister.

01:41.496 --> 01:43.996
Undefeated since birth.

01:45.212 --> 01:46.397
In the Space Scouts,

01:46.399 --> 01:50.299
my game play was so legendary,
they called me Minotaur.

01:50.591 --> 01:52.991
Is that cause you were half a man
who was full of bull?

01:55.395 --> 01:57.008
Because I was like the
mythological beast

01:57.009 --> 01:59.043
that no one could pass.

01:59.097 --> 02:01.533
Well, you better not
throw a 2 and a 1 then, Rimmer.

02:01.534 --> 02:04.096
Throw a 2 and a 1 and land on
my space station,

02:04.097 --> 02:06.897
and your bank is 'rupted, baby.

02:07.322 --> 02:09.489
Lister, I'm not gonna
throw a 2 and a 1.

02:09.603 --> 02:11.503
The odds of that are...

02:13.556 --> 02:16.275
eighteen to one.
It's not happening.

02:16.276 --> 02:19.859
I win, you can't complain
about anything I do for entire week.

02:19.860 --> 02:21.406
I remember the deal.

02:21.407 --> 02:24.014
I win, I can move my lips
when I read.

02:24.015 --> 02:26.524
I can leave peetra (?)
on the floor

02:26.525 --> 02:27.639
so that you step in it.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.203
I can even snore like an
inebriated warthog

02:30.204 --> 02:33.270
and you can't throw
frozen onion bhajis at me.

02:34.396 --> 02:36.520
The good times are gonna roll!

02:36.521 --> 02:38.989
Lister, there's only gonna be
one winner here,

02:39.122 --> 02:41.122
And that's votres truly.

02:42.018 --> 02:44.424
And when I do, as agreed,

02:44.425 --> 02:45.938
you are going to wear
an evening gown,

02:45.939 --> 02:47.563
day and night,
until you can play

02:47.564 --> 02:50.497
James Last's Polka Party
on the bagpipes.

02:51.158 --> 02:52.174
Here we go!

02:52.175 --> 02:54.102
Anything but a 2 and a 1.

02:54.103 --> 02:56.186
A 2 and a 1.
Come to Daddy!

02:56.187 --> 02:57.288
No willing it.

02:57.289 --> 02:59.413
I'm willing it. I'm allowed to will it.
I'm willing it.

02:59.414 --> 03:02.014
Stop willing it! You're good at willing it.
No willing it!

03:03.873 --> 03:05.574
Come on...

03:09.358 --> 03:11.591
Out! Doesn't count!
Doesn't count!

03:11.592 --> 03:13.981
One of the dice
came off the table!

03:13.983 --> 03:15.782
Re-throw required.

03:19.626 --> 03:21.026
That doesn't count.

03:21.723 --> 03:24.877
I used my hands, an illegal move.
Naughty me!

03:24.878 --> 03:26.579
Re-throw required.

03:28.692 --> 03:32.692
5,382 to 1.
No chance.

03:39.151 --> 03:40.697
You couldn't make this up!

03:40.698 --> 03:42.198
Wait.

03:50.278 --> 03:52.079
You throw.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.659
Swap chairs!

04:01.203 --> 04:02.703
Throw.

04:08.342 --> 04:13.175
Do you now accept that you
threw a 2 and a 1 and you lost this game?!

04:22.802 --> 04:24.837
Okay!
I accept it!!

04:24.838 --> 04:28.372
Just lucky for you,
I'm such a good loser!!!!

04:42.052 --> 04:43.400
Hey,

04:43.401 --> 04:47.244
This green blinky thing,
we've any idea what it is yet?

04:47.245 --> 04:48.463
It's an escape pod, Sir.

04:48.465 --> 04:49.986
And it seems to be emitting

04:49.987 --> 04:52.197
an unclassified energy field

04:52.199 --> 04:54.246
that's causing
minute disruptions

04:54.247 --> 04:55.980
to everything in
the local vicinity.

04:56.215 --> 04:58.382
Pretty much as I figured, then!

04:59.105 --> 05:00.313
Talk in English, would ya!?

05:00.314 --> 05:02.348
I'm not fluent in gibberish!!

05:03.658 --> 05:07.366
This is the S.S. Samsara Escape Pod,
Ident 12/Beta Two.

05:07.367 --> 05:09.069
Can you read me, over?

05:09.071 --> 05:11.960
Y-yes, we copy, Ident 12/Beta two.

05:11.961 --> 05:15.295
This is very important,
you must.....

05:17.680 --> 05:19.559
What happened?!?
We lose the link?!?

05:19.560 --> 05:20.524
No matter, Sir.

05:20.526 --> 05:23.526
I'll remote control
the pod into the cargo bay.

05:32.295 --> 05:34.774
Who eats ice cream in bed?
It's just utterly..

05:34.776 --> 05:36.111
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.

05:36.112 --> 05:37.213
No complaining.

05:38.612 --> 05:42.245
And no complaining about not being able
to complain about not complaining.

05:42.581 --> 05:44.026
An entire week,

05:44.028 --> 05:46.018
without being moaned at by you.

05:46.019 --> 05:47.971
It doesn't get better than this!

05:47.973 --> 05:49.218
Do you know what
the difference is

05:49.220 --> 05:50.461
between you and me?

05:50.463 --> 05:53.430
I can't store hand luggage
in me nostrils.

05:58.447 --> 06:00.247
I am cursed.

06:00.963 --> 06:02.367
I remember the day it happened.

06:02.369 --> 06:05.857
I was nine years old and this
busker claimed he was an alien

06:05.858 --> 06:08.326
and wanted to sell me
some lucky space dust.

06:09.809 --> 06:11.583
Even at nine, I was no fool.

06:11.584 --> 06:13.634
I knew he was real.

06:15.297 --> 06:16.699
But all I had was my hover fare

06:16.701 --> 06:19.934
to get me home from
baton twirling practice.

06:21.755 --> 06:24.144
And as I walked off,
he cursed me for life

06:24.146 --> 06:26.745
and I've never had
any luck since.

06:26.959 --> 06:29.281
It was just some
homeless bloke, Rimmer,

06:29.283 --> 06:30.515
trying to make a buck.

06:30.516 --> 06:32.716
You cant take things
like that seriously.

06:32.927 --> 06:35.495
Smeg happens.
You just roll with it.

06:36.380 --> 06:39.781
I've been rolling in smeg
my whole damned life, Lister.

06:40.956 --> 06:43.257
Don't lecture me
about smeg-rolling.

06:44.524 --> 06:45.773
I never get the breaks.

06:45.774 --> 06:47.583
Oh here we go,
"Whereas you..."

06:47.584 --> 06:49.724
Whereas you...
"lead a charmed life."

06:49.725 --> 06:51.300
lead a charmed life!
Well it's true - you do!

06:51.302 --> 06:53.380
I'm alone in
deep space with you!

06:53.382 --> 06:55.581
How charmed is that?!

06:55.742 --> 06:58.215
The crew got wiped out,
you survived - that's charmed.

06:58.216 --> 07:02.016
I survived to live the rest of my life
with you - not charmed!

07:02.480 --> 07:04.398
I'm dead!
How unlucky is that?!?

07:04.399 --> 07:07.053
You're dead but
you're still talking to me!

07:07.055 --> 07:08.342
How unlucky is that?!?

07:08.343 --> 07:09.749
Bing bong!

07:09.750 --> 07:13.559
Sorry, Sirs. The bing bong machine
is being serviced this evening.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.665
I'm afraid we're on manual.

07:15.666 --> 07:16.963
Sorry to disturb,

07:16.964 --> 07:20.190
but we've salvaged an escape pod
with two survivors.

07:20.192 --> 07:23.895
One Colonel Jim Green,
and one Professor Rachel Barker.

07:23.896 --> 07:25.612
We're just about to
open the booth

07:25.613 --> 07:28.815
and take them to the
science room for debriefing.

07:28.817 --> 07:30.983
Message ends.
Bing bong!

07:33.180 --> 07:36.220
Acting Senior Commanding Officer
Arnold J. Rimmer,

07:36.221 --> 07:37.620
an absolute pleasure
to meet you.

07:37.740 --> 07:38.596
Uh, Sir. Uh.

07:38.598 --> 07:41.398
Colonel Green,
and Professor Barker.

07:44.802 --> 07:46.103
They're dead!

07:46.237 --> 07:47.853
Hey, their medical
reports aren't in yet.

07:47.855 --> 07:49.654
We shouldn't jump
to conclusions!

07:51.641 --> 07:53.746
We spoke to Barker
then the link went down.

07:53.747 --> 07:55.809
When we opened the pod,
we discovered this.

07:55.810 --> 07:56.994
What happened?!?

07:56.995 --> 07:59.117
Well, they appear
to have been vaporized, Sir.

07:59.119 --> 08:00.828
Quite how and why,
we're not sure.

08:00.829 --> 08:01.943
What do we know about them?

08:01.944 --> 08:03.964
Well, the log
tells us that Green

08:03.966 --> 08:05.336
was the ship's human

08:05.338 --> 08:07.550
exploration and
mission director.

08:07.552 --> 08:09.423
Barker was a computer scientist.

08:09.425 --> 08:12.141
They were both married,
but not to each other.

08:12.143 --> 08:12.942
Surprising!

08:13.163 --> 08:16.130
They look like they'd be
the perfect match!

08:17.704 --> 08:19.952
What became of the ship
the escape pod escaped from?

08:19.954 --> 08:21.598
The S.S. Samsara.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.380
Have we any idea
what happened to that?

08:23.382 --> 08:25.651
Well, judging from the
pod's flight recorder,

08:25.653 --> 08:27.300
and the fact that there is
no wreckage,

08:27.302 --> 08:30.518
we believe the ship must have
crashed on this ocean moon.

08:30.519 --> 08:32.422
It seems to me we should
do two things:

08:32.423 --> 08:34.469
One - scatter the ashes.

08:34.470 --> 08:37.037
And two - find this ship.

08:42.033 --> 08:44.734
On to two, then.
Find this ship!

09:12.248 --> 09:14.719
So, what are we
hoping to find here?

09:14.720 --> 09:17.830
Faster than light drive,
quantum computer -

09:17.831 --> 09:18.745
but to be honest,

09:18.746 --> 09:21.178
I'd settle for a
bubble gum dispenser.

09:24.681 --> 09:27.713
I wonder what happened
to Barker and Green.

09:28.086 --> 09:29.986
Wrist please.
Thank you.

09:32.774 --> 09:33.825
Sirs?

09:33.826 --> 09:35.807
Professor Barker
reporting for duty.

09:35.808 --> 09:38.005
Welcome to the Samsara,
Professor.

09:38.006 --> 09:39.282
This is my colleague,
Colonel Green.

09:39.283 --> 09:40.297
Anka.

09:40.298 --> 09:43.110
We were both stationed on
Caicos 12, Sir.

09:43.111 --> 09:44.667
Ah, Caicos 12, of course, yes.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.111
We discovered my wife attended

09:46.113 --> 09:48.188
the same college
as your husband.

09:48.190 --> 09:51.356
I must get on.
I'll catch up with you later, Jim.

09:51.686 --> 09:52.845
Now remind me,

09:52.846 --> 09:55.036
You were a computer
scientist specializing in...

09:55.037 --> 09:56.558
What was it again?

09:56.559 --> 09:58.876
I've missed you much!

09:58.878 --> 10:00.087
I thought you'd never
get the transfer.

10:00.089 --> 10:01.188
Nor me.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.702
Let's go to my quarters.

10:07.726 --> 10:08.950
Look at this dust.

10:08.951 --> 10:10.369
I love dust.

10:10.370 --> 10:13.769
After fluff, it's my
all-time favorite dirt!

10:14.519 --> 10:17.485
We've any idea what caused
this crate to crash?

10:17.831 --> 10:19.195
Nothing yet, Sir.

10:19.196 --> 10:21.239
It's a state-of-the-art
research ship,

10:21.240 --> 10:23.661
with self-repairing
engine parts!

10:23.662 --> 10:26.062
Crashing should have been
out of the question.

10:26.201 --> 10:27.801
What's this?!

10:32.254 --> 10:35.653
Well, you can see
why they crashed.

10:35.807 --> 10:37.446
Tell me about it.

10:37.447 --> 10:38.657
How can you fly a space ship,

10:38.658 --> 10:40.341
and at the exact same time,

10:40.342 --> 10:42.176
all play Twister?!

10:43.971 --> 10:46.571
I don't think it was Twister
they were playing.

10:47.067 --> 10:49.085
Not properly, that's for sure.

10:49.086 --> 10:51.376
Twister is a
three-player game.

10:51.378 --> 10:53.977
Everyone here's just
waded right in!

10:55.780 --> 10:57.663
Hey!
Wait your turn, buddy!

10:57.664 --> 10:59.032
What's the rush?

11:00.022 --> 11:02.721
This is worst and fresh
as we got in art school.

11:04.019 --> 11:06.424
How did they die like this?
It doesn't make sense.

11:06.426 --> 11:08.010
According to the phys scan,

11:08.011 --> 11:10.245
they were flash-heated to death!

11:10.306 --> 11:11.311
An instant blast

11:11.312 --> 11:14.145
of extreme temperature
killing them instantly,

11:14.147 --> 11:16.748
but preserving their body positions.

11:16.749 --> 11:17.849
Spooky!!

11:17.921 --> 11:19.421
Agreed, Sir!

11:19.625 --> 11:22.176
A cold chill has just run
straight down my spine.

11:22.177 --> 11:25.177
Eh, that was me - just spilled
some lager down your back.

11:27.996 --> 11:29.284
Who turned that on?

11:29.286 --> 11:31.691
The mainframe probably
detected us.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.493
Check this!

11:35.716 --> 11:38.201
According to his dog tag,
this man was the captain.

11:38.202 --> 11:39.503
Tom Cadry.

11:39.504 --> 11:41.587
Indecipherable gibberish.

11:41.588 --> 11:42.991
What kind of writing is that?
Gelf?

11:42.993 --> 11:45.759
Looks like Welsh after
about 15 pints.

11:46.378 --> 11:48.590
Strange, that dialect is not
on my data base.

11:48.591 --> 11:51.359
Maybe it is Welsh after
about 15 pints.

11:51.534 --> 11:52.634
I wonder...

11:53.052 --> 11:54.065
Sir,

11:54.066 --> 11:55.667
would you mind sitting down?

11:55.668 --> 11:57.768
What, me?

12:00.243 --> 12:02.153
Dictation on.

12:02.154 --> 12:03.833
Permission to strangle you, Sir.

12:03.835 --> 12:09.294
What?!
Granted!

12:15.342 --> 12:17.071
So maybe the captain
was strangled,

12:17.072 --> 12:19.773
by this person here,
who's been stabbed!

12:20.041 --> 12:22.607
Perhaps the next hub
will offer a clue!

12:23.427 --> 12:26.594
Thanks for that, Kryten.
Very well explained!

12:29.532 --> 12:32.006
Jim, I'm so sorry I'm late!

12:32.008 --> 12:33.308
That's all right.
It's only been an hour.

12:33.309 --> 12:35.782
I think I must have eaten
some bad fish last night.

12:35.783 --> 12:37.884
I've been feeling really ill.

12:37.942 --> 12:39.677
Shall we go to your place?

12:40.600 --> 12:41.713
What happened to your back?

12:41.715 --> 12:43.049
Argh - herniated disc.

12:43.051 --> 12:45.951
I've been having
the worst luck recently.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.845
Nothing of interest here.
Let's try the next one.

13:00.089 --> 13:01.597
Look at this!

13:01.599 --> 13:05.033
A one-armed bandit!
How cool is this?!?

13:05.311 --> 13:07.110
I need a coin!

13:11.390 --> 13:12.791
I'm an orphan, ain't I?

13:12.794 --> 13:14.902
Why can't I take money
from the orphan fund?

13:14.903 --> 13:15.841
Are you really going to take it?

13:15.842 --> 13:17.196
Who's gonna know?

13:17.197 --> 13:18.042
Only you.

13:18.043 --> 13:20.124
And your conscience.

13:20.125 --> 13:22.190
Forrreeeevvvveeerrrr!!

13:22.303 --> 13:24.004
Just relax, would ya?

13:36.940 --> 13:38.984
Ooh!
What was that?

13:38.985 --> 13:40.485
What was what?

13:40.677 --> 13:42.629
Something just dripped
on my head from the ceiling.

13:42.630 --> 13:43.970
Where?

13:43.971 --> 13:45.371
Up there, I think.

13:47.461 --> 13:49.504
What the hell is happening?!?!

13:49.505 --> 13:50.856
Get me outta this thing!!!

13:50.857 --> 13:53.317
I'll get something to cut it!
Don't move!!

13:53.318 --> 13:55.119
Like I'm gonna move!!

13:55.298 --> 13:56.398
Sorry!

14:05.466 --> 14:07.201
I saved you, Bud!

14:13.493 --> 14:15.542
Whatever you do, don't move!!

14:15.543 --> 14:18.042
I gotta knife in my foot!
You think I can move?!

14:18.043 --> 14:19.604
I'm just going to ease it out.

14:19.605 --> 14:20.929
Ease it out, right?!?

14:20.931 --> 14:22.030
Nice and easy.

14:22.234 --> 14:23.625
And you're not just saying
that to make me relax

14:23.626 --> 14:26.448
'cause you think the best thing to do
is to jerk that sucker outta there

14:26.450 --> 14:29.350
with one big-assed yank!?
Aaaargh!!

14:29.552 --> 14:32.352
I had no choice!
It was the only way to get it out!

14:34.302 --> 14:36.134
I think I've gone blind!

14:37.868 --> 14:40.368
It-it must be something
to do with my foot!

14:41.422 --> 14:43.389
I got foot-in-eye
disease!!

14:44.547 --> 14:47.173
Cat, relax man.
It's just a power cut.

14:47.174 --> 14:48.774
What a relief!

14:48.880 --> 14:52.780
For a second there I thought
I'd never see myself again!

14:53.880 --> 14:55.856
Plus having to choose
an outfit every day

14:55.857 --> 14:57.825
that matches your guide dog!!

14:58.904 --> 15:00.337
Don't even go there!

15:01.965 --> 15:03.597
The door's locking!

15:10.799 --> 15:13.104
Sir, the doors are double-sealed.
We'll never get through!

15:13.105 --> 15:14.404
So what do we do?!

15:14.510 --> 15:16.514
Suggest we head for
the next chamber,

15:16.515 --> 15:18.114
and see if there's
an access port

15:18.115 --> 15:20.416
back to the main hub.

15:20.927 --> 15:21.952
Where's your torch?

15:21.953 --> 15:23.580
I left it in the other chamber!

15:23.581 --> 15:25.715
I left mine, too.
I can't see a thing!

15:25.716 --> 15:28.216
Give my eyes a minute to adjust.

15:28.943 --> 15:30.974
Oh, wow!

15:30.975 --> 15:33.174
What? They're readjusting?
What'd you see?

15:33.409 --> 15:34.976
That it's really dark?

15:36.408 --> 15:38.084
Can't you see that?

15:38.085 --> 15:40.250
Of course I can see that,
you smeghead!

15:40.491 --> 15:42.404
Well you can see
in the dark, right?

15:42.405 --> 15:44.796
With your super-seey
cat's eyes, right?!

15:44.797 --> 15:46.297
And you can swing
from trees, right?

15:46.298 --> 15:49.466
With your super-swinging
monkey arms, right?!

15:50.388 --> 15:51.518
We evolved!

15:51.519 --> 15:52.519
So did we!

15:52.520 --> 15:54.955
Who'd evolve so that they
can't see in the dark!?

15:54.956 --> 15:58.023
Who'd evolve so they
can't swing from trees?!

15:58.861 --> 16:00.528
You'd never be late
for anything!

16:00.828 --> 16:02.229
Kryten!

16:02.442 --> 16:03.543
Rimmer!

16:03.875 --> 16:04.975
Help!!!

16:06.191 --> 16:08.124
I suppose we've just
gotta sit tight.

16:08.130 --> 16:09.614
I'm gonna fix my foot.

16:09.615 --> 16:11.514
I'll get the first aid kit.
You sit down.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Can't see a thing!

16:52.274 --> 16:53.806
What the hell was that?!?

16:53.807 --> 16:56.107
Ship's slipping into the mush.

16:56.191 --> 16:58.624
W-we're gonna die,
I just know it!

16:59.236 --> 17:00.980
How come you're
so damned chill?!?

17:00.981 --> 17:03.065
We've gotta stay cool,
haven't we?

17:03.066 --> 17:05.122
We don't want the ship
sliding any more.

17:05.123 --> 17:07.823
We'll sit tight here,
fix your foot,

17:07.983 --> 17:10.862
wait for the others to find us,
and then we get out of town.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.854
You're right.
Stay calm.

17:12.855 --> 17:14.039
We've got food, water,

17:14.040 --> 17:15.559
everything we need!

17:15.560 --> 17:16.797
You and me,

17:16.798 --> 17:20.198
we can survive in here for days,
weeks, months even!

17:21.146 --> 17:22.760
Just the two of us!

17:22.761 --> 17:24.862
Kryten!!!!!

17:30.380 --> 17:31.728
Sir!
Are you okay?

17:31.729 --> 17:33.828
I think so.

17:40.679 --> 17:42.292
What is that?!

17:42.294 --> 17:44.173
I believe it's a Karma Drive, Sir.

17:44.174 --> 17:45.193
A what?

17:45.194 --> 17:48.032
It's based on the old
Justice World tech,

17:48.034 --> 17:50.468
where the pain an individual
inflicts on another

17:50.469 --> 17:52.368
is redirected back on them.

17:52.694 --> 17:54.556
With one important difference -

17:54.557 --> 17:56.572
the Karma Drive has two modes.

17:56.573 --> 17:59.472
A punishment setting,
and a reward setting.

17:59.594 --> 18:00.861
What's the point of that?

18:00.909 --> 18:03.720
They were designed for
long-haul space missions.

18:03.721 --> 18:05.943
They were intended
to promote teamwork,

18:05.944 --> 18:09.355
reward kindness, understanding,
and ethical behavior.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.075
So, how does it work, exactly?

18:11.076 --> 18:14.576
Well it creates a Karma field
that analyzes behavior,

18:14.667 --> 18:18.367
and then manipulates reality
to reward or punish.

18:18.625 --> 18:21.492
So when you behave ethically,
the ship rewards you.

18:21.660 --> 18:22.752
How?

18:22.753 --> 18:25.263
Your coffee is fresh,
your shower is warm,

18:25.265 --> 18:26.852
your food is tasty.

18:26.853 --> 18:28.271
Well that doesn't make sense.

18:28.272 --> 18:30.953
Morality changes across
time and cultures.

18:30.954 --> 18:33.439
Once slavery was
an accepted way of life.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.539
Now it's considered repugnant.

18:35.692 --> 18:38.113
Who decides what's
immoral and moral?

18:38.114 --> 18:39.662
Well, it's programmable, Sir.

18:39.663 --> 18:41.147
And that's what made
the Karma Drive

18:41.148 --> 18:42.915
such a dangerous piece of kit.

18:42.916 --> 18:45.729
Anyone can implement
the moral code of their choice,

18:45.730 --> 18:47.616
and then force others
to live by it.

18:47.617 --> 18:49.920
I wonder if that's what happened
to me on Red Dwarf

18:49.921 --> 18:51.688
when I lost at Mineopoly.

18:52.429 --> 18:55.570
Did Red Dwarf enter
the Karma Drive's field?

18:55.572 --> 18:58.204
Was the drive manipulating
the dice somehow?

18:58.292 --> 18:59.672
I don't understand, Sir.

18:59.673 --> 19:02.039
I threw a 2 and a 1
seven times in a row.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.173
What are the odds of that?

19:03.251 --> 19:05.352
62 million to 1, Sir.

19:05.582 --> 19:08.516
About the same as being killed
by a tangerine.

19:11.403 --> 19:13.969
Why punish me?
I wasn't doing anything wrong!

19:14.383 --> 19:16.490
Kryten, this Karma Drive
is too unpredictable.

19:16.491 --> 19:18.192
We've gotta get
out of here pronto.

19:18.211 --> 19:20.228
Sir, there is no
cause for alarm.

19:20.229 --> 19:21.646
We're under no danger

19:21.647 --> 19:23.779
as long as we don't do
anything vindictive,

19:23.780 --> 19:25.580
selfish, or unethical.

19:25.826 --> 19:27.358
Kryten, we're in big trouble.

19:28.963 --> 19:31.131
Sir, you just have to
be nice to me.

19:31.151 --> 19:33.651
Big, big trouble.

19:33.688 --> 19:36.108
The Karma Drive report has just
come down from central ops,

19:36.109 --> 19:38.309
and it doesn't make for
pleasant reading.

19:38.519 --> 19:40.900
You both have committed
a whole range of misdemeanors.

19:40.901 --> 19:42.528
There's a Karma Drive on board?

19:42.529 --> 19:43.358
Last week alone:

19:43.359 --> 19:45.801
Extra-marital sex 18 times?

19:45.802 --> 19:48.502
Extra-marital fondling 67 times!

19:48.516 --> 19:52.148
Extra-marital licking whipped cream off...
We get the picture!

19:52.150 --> 19:53.267
It goes on!

19:53.268 --> 19:56.664
You, Rachel, have lied this week to
your husband and others 93 times?!

19:56.665 --> 19:57.810
That's just not true!

19:57.811 --> 19:59.311
94 times!

20:00.130 --> 20:02.654
You've been unkind 20 times,
criticized others 40 times,

20:02.655 --> 20:04.334
and not said "thank you" twice?!

20:04.335 --> 20:05.335
Captain,

20:05.449 --> 20:07.348
We're in love.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.122
When you signed up
for this tour of duty,

20:09.123 --> 20:12.271
you agreed to abide by the moral code
selected for this ship.

20:12.272 --> 20:14.929
So we're all supposed to
live the Mega Core dream,

20:14.930 --> 20:18.743
where the married stay married,
and sons call their fathers, "Sir!"

20:18.744 --> 20:21.411
and everyone eats lots of
homemade apple pie!

20:21.479 --> 20:24.575
You got it - so start squirting
your whip cream on apple pie,

20:24.576 --> 20:27.209
and not on one another's
body parts!

20:28.990 --> 20:30.089
Hey!

20:31.098 --> 20:32.633
Good job on the foot, Bud!

20:33.626 --> 20:35.727
Even managed to save the boot!

20:37.177 --> 20:39.155
We've gotta think
of a way to get out of here.

20:39.156 --> 20:42.436
Nah, just give me like 10 minutes.
I'll bet I come up with a plan.

20:42.438 --> 20:46.137
I get great ideas all the time.
I just don't say 'em out loud!

20:47.253 --> 20:48.953
You say everything
you think out loud.

20:49.023 --> 20:52.157
I'm like that inventor guy -
b-begins with "R".

20:52.863 --> 20:54.345
Rosenthal?
Sidney Rosenthal?

20:54.346 --> 20:55.157
Who?

20:55.159 --> 20:56.258
Invented the magic marker.

20:56.259 --> 20:57.659
Magic marker?!

20:57.679 --> 21:00.019
The guy I'm talking about
is real!

21:00.020 --> 21:03.520
He ain't no wizard out of
a book with his magic pen!!

21:03.873 --> 21:06.384
Inventor guy.
Begins with an "R"...

21:06.385 --> 21:08.143
I-I-I got it!
I got it!

21:08.144 --> 21:09.587
The inventor guy I'm like!

21:09.588 --> 21:10.715
Begins with "R"!

21:10.717 --> 21:11.731
Who?

21:11.732 --> 21:13.432
Archimedes!

21:15.250 --> 21:16.387
Archimedes.

21:16.388 --> 21:17.788
Archimedes!

21:17.929 --> 21:20.595
The guy that sat under trees
and invented stuff!

21:20.701 --> 21:21.770
That was Newton.

21:21.771 --> 21:23.672
You never heard this story?

21:24.327 --> 21:28.028
So, one day Archimedes
is sitting under a tree.

21:28.278 --> 21:29.901
The all of a sudden
out of nowhere,

21:29.902 --> 21:31.387
this bath hits him on the head

21:31.388 --> 21:32.388
POW!!

21:33.980 --> 21:37.579
And he gets up, shouts "formica",
and invents gravy!

21:39.861 --> 21:42.396
It was Newton who was sat
under the tree.

21:42.397 --> 21:44.417
And he discovered gravity

21:44.419 --> 21:46.618
when he got hit on the
head by an apple.

21:46.731 --> 21:48.509
An apple can't concuss ya!

21:48.510 --> 21:50.487
That ain't gonna make you
stagger around,

21:50.488 --> 21:52.887
shout "formica"
and invent gravy!

21:55.306 --> 22:00.006
Formica is a heat-resistant,
wipe clean, plastic laminate.

22:00.096 --> 22:01.592
Who'd shout "formica"?

22:01.593 --> 22:03.333
It doesn't make any sense.

22:03.334 --> 22:05.433
No one shouts "formica"!

22:05.815 --> 22:07.599
You get hit on the
head with a bath,

22:07.601 --> 22:09.634
everyone shouts "formica"!

22:10.971 --> 22:12.749
Look, Archimedes discovered

22:12.750 --> 22:14.512
something to do with
water displacement

22:14.513 --> 22:18.881
when he was sat in the bath,
and he shouted "eureka!"

22:19.769 --> 22:20.869
So,

22:20.906 --> 22:23.007
Mr. Ellen Einstein,

22:26.055 --> 22:27.555
Answer me this:

22:27.606 --> 22:30.296
Who invented gravy?
No one?

22:30.297 --> 22:32.565
Did it just magically
appear one day

22:32.566 --> 22:34.898
like your stupid wizard pen?!

22:36.640 --> 22:39.039
Gotta have some pain killers.

22:40.136 --> 22:41.237
Okay, listen.

22:42.614 --> 22:44.013
Answer me this:

22:44.325 --> 22:46.143
How does a bath
fall out of a tree?

22:46.144 --> 22:48.344
A plane, dummy!

22:49.124 --> 22:50.824
Taking off!

22:50.999 --> 22:53.858
They probably forgot
to shut the back door!

22:53.859 --> 22:57.093
And the bath slid all the way
from first class.

22:57.130 --> 22:58.337
WHOOSH!

22:58.338 --> 23:00.090
Through the curtains,
into business -

23:00.092 --> 23:01.095
WHOOSH!

23:01.096 --> 23:02.981
Through the curtains,
into premium -

23:02.982 --> 23:03.974
WHOOSH!

23:03.976 --> 23:07.675
Through the curtains,
and straight into the poor people section.

23:08.566 --> 23:09.570
Who incidentally,

23:09.571 --> 23:11.883
probably still haven't
even had a bag of peanuts,

23:11.884 --> 23:14.088
while the dudes in first
have already eaten,

23:14.089 --> 23:17.464
watched a movie,
and are all now having a bath!

23:18.874 --> 23:21.465
Meanwhile Arcie's
sitting under his tree.

23:21.467 --> 23:22.480
CLANG!

23:22.481 --> 23:23.981
Invents gravy.

23:27.223 --> 23:29.143
And because everyone's
so damned happy

23:29.144 --> 23:30.681
because everybody
loves gravy, right?

23:30.682 --> 23:33.833
They gave him a special hat
to wear at night

23:33.834 --> 23:35.601
to cover up the bruising!

23:37.840 --> 23:39.540
Special hat?

23:39.970 --> 23:41.869
They gave him a knighthood.

23:43.459 --> 23:45.259
A "knight" "hood".

23:45.932 --> 23:49.099
Not a special hat to wear
at night to cover up the bruising!

23:49.317 --> 23:50.424
Man,

23:50.425 --> 23:54.393
I try to teach you stuff...
I don't know why I bother!

23:56.047 --> 23:57.480
What's that saying?!

23:57.596 --> 23:59.496
You can lead a hearse to water,

23:59.497 --> 24:01.396
but you can't make it sink!

24:03.922 --> 24:05.622
K-Kryten!!!

24:06.344 --> 24:07.743
Help!!!

24:12.065 --> 24:14.164
720 meters, Sir.

24:14.223 --> 24:15.923
The ship's nearly
at crush depth.

24:16.176 --> 24:18.644
The Karma Drive is controlling
everything on board.

24:18.820 --> 24:20.643
We have to be kind
to one another

24:20.644 --> 24:23.809
to stand any chance to save
Mr. Lister and Mr. Cat!

24:23.857 --> 24:25.705
An excellent suggestion, Kryten.

24:25.707 --> 24:27.137
That's very insightful of you

24:27.138 --> 24:28.348
to make such a
helpful recommendation,

24:28.349 --> 24:30.049
and I thank you greatly.

24:32.295 --> 24:33.394
Static!!

24:35.013 --> 24:36.413
I was complimenting you!

24:36.875 --> 24:38.073
Why did it punish me?

24:38.074 --> 24:40.173
Perhaps it wasn't genuine, Sir.

24:40.392 --> 24:42.791
I've got to be genuinely nice?

24:43.802 --> 24:45.836
Oh, this is impossible!

24:46.197 --> 24:47.262
Oh dear.

24:47.263 --> 24:48.364
What?

24:48.632 --> 24:51.104
I think I know what
killed the crew, Sir.

24:51.105 --> 24:53.205
The ship's quantum motherboards

24:53.332 --> 24:55.463
are power loading
to flash-heat the ship!

24:55.464 --> 24:56.910
We're going to get
flash heated?!

24:56.911 --> 24:58.199
How long have we got?!

24:58.200 --> 25:00.060
I'm not sure, Sir.

25:00.061 --> 25:01.713
Ugh.
Why am I asking you?

25:01.714 --> 25:03.666
Someone with a head
shaped like something

25:03.667 --> 25:06.501
produced in a
geriatrics pottery class?

25:10.374 --> 25:12.182
The power loading
has stopped, Sir!

25:12.183 --> 25:13.683
The temperature's cooling?

25:13.755 --> 25:14.695
Why?

25:14.696 --> 25:16.564
Of course!
That's it!

25:17.443 --> 25:21.310
Man, she was the
greatest soldier in history!

25:21.529 --> 25:23.797
Led her people to victory!!

25:24.147 --> 25:25.548
Julie Caesar.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.810
Kryten!
Thank God!!

25:30.811 --> 25:32.211
Thank God!

25:32.362 --> 25:34.183
No one should have to
suffer like this!

25:34.184 --> 25:35.185
He's right!

25:35.186 --> 25:36.797
If I wasn't there
for him to talk to

25:36.798 --> 25:39.032
he'd probably have gone crazy!

25:39.559 --> 25:42.032
Kryten, man!
It's so good to see ya!

25:42.034 --> 25:43.313
Sir!
Stop!

25:43.314 --> 25:44.234
Stop what?!

25:44.236 --> 25:48.271
You stand there with your
1970s cover band haircut,

25:48.272 --> 25:51.440
and I say to you:
Don't be nice to me!

25:54.088 --> 25:56.388
We know what happened to Barker,

25:58.619 --> 25:59.920
And Green!

26:02.799 --> 26:04.230
What happened to you?

26:04.231 --> 26:05.505
Your hair's insane!

26:05.506 --> 26:07.614
I went to the ship's salon
for a makeover

26:07.615 --> 26:09.644
look what the
robo-stylist did to me.

26:09.645 --> 26:12.132
Yeah - similar thing happened
to me at the dentist.

26:12.133 --> 26:14.684
Every chance it gets,
the Karma Drive

26:14.685 --> 26:15.765
is punishing us.

26:15.766 --> 26:18.483
The showers are freezing,
the air con is icy,

26:18.484 --> 26:20.884
I had to wait
2 hours yesterday....

26:23.746 --> 26:25.813
Have you tasted the food?

26:28.492 --> 26:30.695
Jim!
I can't take this anymore!

26:30.696 --> 26:31.803
We've got no choice.

26:31.804 --> 26:33.203
Yes we do.

26:33.339 --> 26:36.516
I am a computer scientist,
for God's sake!

26:36.517 --> 26:38.845
If I can access
the KD's mainframe,

26:38.846 --> 26:41.552
then perhaps I can
reverse the protocol.

26:41.554 --> 26:43.258
Give us some respite.

26:43.259 --> 26:45.601
Even if it is
only for one night.

26:45.602 --> 26:46.968
Reverse?

26:46.969 --> 26:49.243
So it rewards the unethical
and punishes the good?

26:49.244 --> 26:50.744
Just one night.

26:51.002 --> 26:53.423
Then, we'll stop
seeing each other,

26:53.424 --> 26:54.924
'til we get back home.

26:55.220 --> 26:57.552
Barker and Green reversed
the protocols,

26:57.588 --> 27:00.462
and as a consequence,
good behavior was punished

27:00.463 --> 27:03.097
and immoral behavior
was rewarded!

27:03.263 --> 27:04.369
Kryten just figured it out.

27:04.371 --> 27:05.710
Saved all our necks.

27:05.711 --> 27:08.311
Kryten, if you weren't
so ugly, I could kiss you.

27:08.316 --> 27:10.031
Well, you could
shake my hand, Sir.

27:10.032 --> 27:11.633
Still too ugly.

27:12.585 --> 27:14.926
You see?
Unkindness rewarded.

27:14.928 --> 27:16.567
This is all beginning
to make sense.

27:16.568 --> 27:17.844
I mean, think back.

27:17.845 --> 27:20.575
I mean the Cat, nicked the money
out of orphans' fund,

27:20.576 --> 27:22.035
to play the one armed bandit,

27:22.036 --> 27:23.518
And I won the jackpot!

27:23.519 --> 27:24.781
You were rewarded for stealing.

27:24.782 --> 27:27.449
And I put the winnings
back into the orphans' can,

27:27.450 --> 27:29.182
and got me locks caught
in the shredder!

27:29.183 --> 27:30.967
You were punished
for being benevolent.

27:30.968 --> 27:33.177
I saved him,
and got a knife in my foot!

27:33.179 --> 27:34.388
I fixed his foot,

27:34.390 --> 27:37.289
And he got to spend
quality time with me!

27:39.454 --> 27:41.003
Moving swiftly on...

27:41.005 --> 27:42.837
Who reversed
the protocols and why?

27:42.994 --> 27:44.061
Well, best guess -

27:44.063 --> 27:45.911
Green and Barker
were having an affair

27:45.912 --> 27:47.811
and wanted to
spend time together.

27:47.813 --> 27:49.778
How sad is that?

27:49.922 --> 27:51.900
I mean basically
their love for one another

27:51.901 --> 27:53.358
brought down the entire ship.

27:53.359 --> 27:55.593
One thing I don't understand,

27:55.680 --> 28:00.352
Well, actually there are about
40 things I don't understand.

28:00.353 --> 28:02.029
How come Green and Barker

28:02.030 --> 28:04.359
weren't flash-heated
with the rest of the crew?

28:04.361 --> 28:08.162
While the rest of the crew
survived by acting immorally,

28:08.163 --> 28:10.713
Green and Barker
realized they could escape,

28:10.714 --> 28:13.824
so long as that escape
was unethical.

28:13.825 --> 28:16.531
So they took the ship's
only escape pod and fled!

28:16.532 --> 28:19.006
And then they went into
cryo-sleep for millions of years.

28:19.007 --> 28:20.018
Where they were safe!

28:20.019 --> 28:23.156
But when they tried to warn us
about the Karma field,

28:23.157 --> 28:24.472
an act of kindness...

28:24.473 --> 28:26.099
The Karma Drive
had them vaporized.

28:26.101 --> 28:27.492
So where does that leave us?

28:27.493 --> 28:30.499
It leaves us getting the hell
out of here really carefully!

28:30.500 --> 28:32.008
We just have to
remember to avoid

28:32.009 --> 28:34.386
being honest, moral, kind,
selfless, and helpful.

28:34.387 --> 28:35.527
That's not fair.

28:35.528 --> 28:37.694
You've got such an advantage!

28:39.040 --> 28:40.474
Hey, what's that?

28:41.409 --> 28:43.741
Fuel Tax, miss three goes.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.078
Hey!

28:45.079 --> 28:46.663
How come you got so many

28:46.664 --> 28:49.265
Mineopoly cards in your pocket?!
