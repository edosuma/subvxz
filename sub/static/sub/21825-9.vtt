11:20.948 --> 11:22.516
a formal complaint.
Now go!

11:22.549 --> 11:23.918
All right.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.852
I had to give it my best shot.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.222
I won't bug you again.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.462
(sniffs)

11:43.603 --> 11:45.405
Oh, hey.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.507
Hey.

11:47.541 --> 11:51.178
-I just wanted to check in
and see how it's going. -Oh.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.746
Really well so far.

11:52.779 --> 11:55.249
The detail in these carvings
is really something.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.251
When do you think
you might have some information?

11:57.284 --> 11:59.686
Well, these scans will have
to be analyzed,

11:59.719 --> 12:02.256
and if we find any residual DNA,

12:02.289 --> 12:04.224
that'll have
to be cross-referenced

12:04.258 --> 12:08.862
against present-day samples
of both species, so... few days?

12:08.895 --> 12:11.298
Sounds good.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.235
You didn't have
to come all the way down here

12:15.269 --> 12:16.603
just to get a status update.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.138
(sighs)

12:18.172 --> 12:21.775
Okay, um...
I do have something to say.

12:21.808 --> 12:25.612
I really regret
what happened between us,

12:25.645 --> 12:28.048
and it's never
gonna happen again.

12:28.082 --> 12:29.549
I've put a lot of time

12:29.583 --> 12:31.451
into rebuilding my relationship
with Ed.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.053
Oh, you two are back together?

12:33.087 --> 12:34.621
No. Oh, God, no.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.923
He would never trust me
in that way again.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.625
I meant as professionals.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.428
I just want to make it clear.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.797
Wha... Wha-What are you doing?

12:43.830 --> 12:45.832
You just had a stray hair.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.335
Oh.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.704
Thanks.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.275
What's... different?

12:55.309 --> 12:57.511
-You look great.
-I gave up sugar.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.280
And I'm doing an hour
of headstand meditation a day.

13:00.314 --> 13:01.848
-Really?
-Mm.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.617
You can totally tell.

13:03.650 --> 13:06.586
I mean, the whites of your eyes
are, like, super white.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.288
Really makes your skin pop.

13:08.322 --> 13:10.757
Oh, thanks.
It's all circulation, yeah.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.292
And it really helps
with everything.

13:12.326 --> 13:15.929
Mental focus, clarity,
you know, muscle tone.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.431
Sex drive.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.932
Yeah?

13:18.965 --> 13:21.635
Oh, God, you know,
it is just so hard

13:21.668 --> 13:23.603
to take care of yourself
on the ship.

13:23.637 --> 13:26.940
It's, like,
where's the me time, you know?

13:26.973 --> 13:30.344
Where is the you time?

13:39.253 --> 13:41.688
Captain,
the Bruidians have arrived,

13:41.721 --> 13:44.224
and the Navarians
are approaching.

13:44.258 --> 13:45.959
However,
the shuttle bay is reporting

13:45.992 --> 13:47.794
there is no one there
to receive them.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.730
Kelly's supposed
to be down there. Where is she?

13:52.066 --> 13:54.634
Internal scan shows her
in her quarters.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.902
What the hell?

14:02.176 --> 14:03.710
(door chimes)

14:03.743 --> 14:05.512
(sighs)

14:11.185 --> 14:12.919
Kel?

14:12.952 --> 14:15.122
(Kelly laughs)

14:21.728 --> 14:23.597
Kelly, the Bruidian ambassadors

14:23.630 --> 14:25.031
-are here, and there...
-(Kelly gasps)

14:25.065 --> 14:27.101
Oh, no.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.174
I...

14:34.208 --> 14:35.942
(sighs)

14:45.419 --> 14:47.954
Ed, hang on.
I can explain.

14:47.987 --> 14:50.457
I don't need it explained.
You're a sexual jihadist!

14:50.490 --> 14:52.126
Lower your voice and calm down,
okay? I can explain.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.893
Oh, am I yelling? Am I yelling?

14:53.927 --> 14:56.430
Are you worried people are gonna
hear that you banged Darulio

14:56.463 --> 14:58.698
again when you were supposed
to be in the shuttle bay

14:58.732 --> 15:01.034
preventing a war from starting?
Are you insane?!

15:01.067 --> 15:02.769
Look, I thought
we talked about this, okay.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.404
We can both see whoever we want,
isn't that what we agreed?

15:04.438 --> 15:05.805
Oh, come on.
You're not gonna pretend

15:05.839 --> 15:07.374
that that is not
completely out of bounds?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.243
I like him, Ed, okay?
I can't help it.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.145
And guess what.
I have the right to like

15:11.178 --> 15:13.313
-whoever I want.
-Oh, come on. You're not...

15:13.347 --> 15:16.816
Whoa! We all have
to stop meeting like this.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.255
(Ed sighs)

15:21.288 --> 15:23.557
(beeps)

15:23.590 --> 15:25.058
(Kelly sighs)

15:25.091 --> 15:27.093
So, did you have a chance
to talk to anyone

15:27.127 --> 15:28.928
about getting music
in these elevators?

15:28.962 --> 15:31.265
You know what, Dann? Why don't
you make that your project, huh?

15:31.298 --> 15:32.832
Why-why don't you look
into that?

15:32.866 --> 15:35.001
Will do, Cap'n.

15:35.034 --> 15:37.171
(elevator whirs to a stop,
doors whoosh open)

15:40.140 --> 15:42.342
You are all barbarians!

15:42.376 --> 15:44.010
The planet is ours,

15:44.043 --> 15:45.912
and your colonies are
a blatantly hostile incursion!

15:45.945 --> 15:47.414
ED:
What's going on?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.483
They went from zero to furious
in two seconds.

15:49.516 --> 15:50.917
And that's your justification

15:50.950 --> 15:52.186
for the killing
of innocent civilians?!

15:52.219 --> 15:53.920
What are we supposed to do

15:53.953 --> 15:55.922
when you attack our supply lines
in order to starve us out?!

15:55.955 --> 15:59.259
Starvation would be too noble
a death for your kind.

15:59.293 --> 16:00.760
-(snarls) -Hey! No!
-ED: Oh, hey, hey, hey, guys!

16:00.794 --> 16:02.095
Guys, guys, relax, okay?

16:02.128 --> 16:03.597
Just take a breath, all right?

16:03.630 --> 16:05.265
I know traveling's a bitch,
but calm down.

16:05.299 --> 16:07.334
We're gonna get you all
to your rooms and squared away.

16:07.367 --> 16:11.004
Bruidians, we have salt water
for bathing in your quarters.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.607
Navarians, we've programmed
our food synthesizers to serve

16:13.640 --> 16:15.175
Cavellian Spiceroot for dinner.

16:15.209 --> 16:17.344
Thank you, Captain.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.112
Very thoughtful.

16:19.145 --> 16:22.182
Now, look,
I know you've both agreed

16:22.216 --> 16:24.451
to honor the results
of the archaeological tests,

16:24.484 --> 16:27.454
but that means
one of you loses big.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.323
So here's what I'm proposing.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.392
Why don't we meet tomorrow
and just talk,

16:32.426 --> 16:34.494
see if maybe there's a way
for you both

16:34.528 --> 16:36.396
to peacefully share the planet,

16:36.430 --> 16:39.899
just so we can say we tried?

16:39.933 --> 16:41.568
(Bruidian ambassador sighs)

16:41.601 --> 16:43.136
Fine.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.838
Agreed.

16:44.871 --> 16:47.173
Look at that. We're making
progress already. Terrific.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.908
All right,
so why don't you guys head

16:48.942 --> 16:50.410
to your rooms,
relax, have a drink?

16:50.444 --> 16:52.646
Uh, minibar's on the house, so

16:52.679 --> 16:54.981
go bananas on those M&M'S, huh?

16:55.014 --> 16:57.384
All right.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.397
Okay, so what happened exactly?

17:10.430 --> 17:13.267
I don't know.
I went to the lab

17:13.300 --> 17:15.535
to tell him there was
nothing between us anymore,

17:15.569 --> 17:19.606
but then
I looked into his eyes, and...

17:19.639 --> 17:21.741
I guess I forgot
how gorgeous he is.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.777
Gorgeous? Really?

17:23.810 --> 17:26.346
Those aqua blue eyes against
that deep blue skin?

17:26.380 --> 17:27.781
Ridiculous.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.617
My mom redid our bathroom
in those colors.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.152
-I guess it's nice.
-Chardonnay.

17:34.921 --> 17:37.257
He has this magnetism.

17:37.291 --> 17:40.694
And then, the next thing I knew,
we're back in my quarters.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.529
-Wow.
-It's just...

17:42.562 --> 17:44.264
(sighs)
It's hard to explain.

17:44.298 --> 17:46.199
It's like a drug.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.434
Was it like that with Ed?

17:47.467 --> 17:48.868
Totally different.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.437
Ed's the kind of guy
you could send out

17:50.470 --> 17:52.406
-for tampons and bagels.
-Hmm.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.441
And he always made me laugh.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.709
That sounds nice.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.712
Yeah, sure, but Darulio...

17:58.745 --> 18:02.816
It's just this super intense
sexual desire,

18:02.849 --> 18:05.619
and this rush
every time I see him.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.754
He's all I can think about.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.757
So much so that you forgot about
the arrival of the delegates.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.427
Oh, it's fine.
It all worked out.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.930
You know, I think the first time
around with Darulio,

18:16.963 --> 18:19.933
all I could think about was
how badly I messed up with Ed.

18:19.966 --> 18:23.102
And maybe
I was so busy feeling guilty

18:23.136 --> 18:25.439
that I missed something.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.106
Missed what?

18:27.140 --> 18:29.743
That I'm in love with him.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.110
Darulio's the one.

18:31.144 --> 18:32.479
He's my soul mate.

18:34.047 --> 18:36.383
Should I get bangs?

18:38.952 --> 18:41.287
How the hell
could she do this again?

18:41.321 --> 18:42.689
How-how is this happening?

18:42.722 --> 18:44.924
Yeah, it's not ideal,
but, I mean,

18:44.958 --> 18:47.260
it's not like you and Kelly
are still together, so,

18:47.293 --> 18:48.762
-technically, she didn't even...
-No, Gordon.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.864
We're not together
because of that guy, okay?

18:50.897 --> 18:52.599
There is no way to spin this

18:52.632 --> 18:54.634
where her judgment is not
completely off the damn scale.

18:54.668 --> 18:56.035
Okay, well, you know what?

18:56.069 --> 18:57.270
Maybe just focus
on the peace talks, huh?

18:57.303 --> 18:58.605
That's a good distraction,
right?

18:58.638 --> 19:00.474
No. You know what?
I'm firing that guy.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.442
We'll get a new archaeologist.
It'll be a minor delay.

19:02.476 --> 19:04.678
But he is gone.
Darulio is gone.

19:07.581 --> 19:10.149
Pack up your crap. You're fired.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.018
What?

19:12.051 --> 19:13.453
You're gone.
Right now.

19:13.487 --> 19:14.721
What you did was
beyond unprofessional.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.656
It's your ship.

19:16.690 --> 19:18.625
I don't want
to cause any trouble.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.360
You don't want any trouble.
That is...

19:20.394 --> 19:22.729
-(laughing): My God, that is
hilarious. -Well, it's too bad,

19:22.762 --> 19:24.664
because we're really making
some progress here.

19:24.698 --> 19:26.332
You-you want
to see something cool?

19:26.366 --> 19:27.834
Do I want
to see something cool?

19:27.867 --> 19:29.503
Have you heard anything
I just said?

19:29.536 --> 19:31.371
Yes, I heard all of it.

19:31.405 --> 19:33.339
And you're absolutely right
to be angry.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.341
I-I have no excuse,
other than the fact

19:35.375 --> 19:36.876
that I come from a culture

19:36.910 --> 19:38.978
where it is considered rude
to turn down sex.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.581
But if you want to kick me out,
I totally get it.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.349
But I'd love to show you
something first.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.386
Come have a look.

19:46.420 --> 19:48.755
(Ed sighs)

19:52.592 --> 19:54.260
What? What am I looking at?

19:54.293 --> 19:57.931
Ancient DNA.
Maybe 30,000 years old.

20:00.434 --> 20:02.368
Is it Bruidian or Navarian?

20:02.402 --> 20:04.604
Incomplete. I need
to do some computer analysis

20:04.638 --> 20:06.706
to see if there are any markers.

20:06.740 --> 20:08.241
Well, how was it preserved?

20:08.274 --> 20:09.743
This artifact?

20:09.776 --> 20:11.244
Turns out
it's a birthing bucket.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.012
The DNA was found

20:13.046 --> 20:15.915
in the remnants of placenta
recovered from inside of it.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.617
You're kidding.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.085
We should know whether

20:19.118 --> 20:21.555
there are any genetic markers
in 36 hours.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.757
Well, good. Hopefully,
that'll give us some time

20:23.790 --> 20:25.525
to broker some peace.

20:25.559 --> 20:27.260
So, I should just...

20:27.293 --> 20:30.630
give my notes to the next
archaeologist. Is that cool?

20:33.733 --> 20:36.703
You know, um,
what'd you say, 36 hours?

20:36.736 --> 20:39.105
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

20:39.138 --> 20:42.241
Why don't you just stay,
you know?

20:42.275 --> 20:44.878
I mean, it's... We can work
through this like adults.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.580
For the sake of the peace.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.815
If that's what
you're comfortable with.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.621
Do you, um...

20:54.654 --> 20:56.756
Do you maybe want
to get a drink later?

20:56.790 --> 20:58.625
Like, we could meet
in the mess hall, you know.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.159
Something like that.
Just, no-nothing crazy.

21:00.193 --> 21:02.428
-Just-just a drink.
-Just totally cazh?

21:02.462 --> 21:03.763
Yeah, just totally,
whatever, you know.

21:03.797 --> 21:05.932
-8:00?
-Love it.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.401
-Okay.
-Okay.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.838
Groov-ay.
(laughs)

21:11.871 --> 21:13.940
Why did I...? I don't-- I don't
know why I just said that.

21:13.973 --> 21:17.243
Groov-ay. I...
I've never said that before

21:17.276 --> 21:18.745
in my life.
That's not how I talk.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.013
I don't say those things.
That's...

21:20.046 --> 21:21.981
(laughs, groans)

21:25.284 --> 21:27.186
-I'll see you there.
-Yeah.

21:37.363 --> 21:38.832
(door chimes)

21:46.205 --> 21:47.507
Claire?

21:47.541 --> 21:49.275
I got off early today.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.377
Can I come in?

21:51.410 --> 21:54.814
I'm gonna give that a big yes.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.664
So... this is your place.

22:10.697 --> 22:13.066
This is it.
This is where the magic happens.

22:14.267 --> 22:16.736
-What's that?
-Oh, well, that's my bed.

22:16.770 --> 22:18.104
Here, I'll show you.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.510
Ah, it's nice
just to be able to spread out

22:24.544 --> 22:27.313
at the end of a long shift.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.115
(giggles) Tickles.

22:31.284 --> 22:32.819
And what is this?

22:32.852 --> 22:35.689
-Is this you and your mom?
-Kind of.

22:35.722 --> 22:36.823
My species reproduces
by mitosis.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.858
That used to be my mom,

22:38.892 --> 22:40.860
but now it's me and my brother.

22:40.894 --> 22:42.596
He got the looks, obviously.

22:42.629 --> 22:43.930
Yaphit.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.098
Yeah?

22:46.199 --> 22:48.902
Do you want to kiss me?

22:48.935 --> 22:50.503
What? I, uh...

22:50.536 --> 22:52.005
Yeah, totally.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.907
I'd like that a lot.

23:06.252 --> 23:08.054
Oh.

23:08.087 --> 23:10.189
What, uh...

23:10.223 --> 23:12.225
what made you change your mind?

23:12.258 --> 23:13.559
Forget about that.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.394
Where do we go from here?

23:15.428 --> 23:17.731
Want to go for a swim?

23:17.764 --> 23:20.466
(inhales)

23:24.838 --> 23:26.940
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.375
Hi. What's up?

23:29.408 --> 23:31.811
Oh, hey. Glad you're here.
I want to show you something.

23:31.845 --> 23:34.648
Hey, how did it go with Darulio?
Did you send him packing?

23:34.681 --> 23:37.550
Oh, you know, it turns out
he's almost done with his work,

23:37.583 --> 23:40.153
so I just figured might as well
leave it, you know?

23:40.186 --> 23:42.588
Really? I mean,
y-you seemed pretty pissed.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.057
Yeah, you know,
we got to talking,

23:44.090 --> 23:46.292
and it turns out
he's a pretty cool guy.

23:46.325 --> 23:48.127
Like, really cool, actually.

23:48.161 --> 23:50.063
We're having drinks
in a half hour.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.799
You're... meeting for drinks.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.133
Yeah. I mean, it's just...

23:54.167 --> 23:55.935
just drinks, you know.
It's no big deal.

23:55.969 --> 23:58.304
It's not like we're getting
married or anything. (laughs)

23:58.337 --> 23:59.673
What?

23:59.706 --> 24:01.507
-Check this out.
-Wait,

24:01.540 --> 24:03.276
are-aren't you supposed
to be mediating the peace talks?

24:03.309 --> 24:04.577
What do you think?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.245
You're gonna wear that
to drinks?

24:06.279 --> 24:08.281
-You hate it.
-Very much so, yes.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.583
God, you know, I just... I want
to show some personal style.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.919
You know?
Darulio has such great style,

24:12.952 --> 24:16.455
and I just want to step up
to that level.

24:16.489 --> 24:19.025
You seem like
you're really into him.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.359
Not into him.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.863
Okay.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.298
But, it's like, what if I was?

24:25.331 --> 24:26.866
You know, what if I was?
Why couldn't I be?

24:26.900 --> 24:28.301
Hey, you can be
whatever you want, man.

24:28.334 --> 24:29.435
I just want you to be happy.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.603
I just didn't know you were...

24:30.636 --> 24:32.371
I'm not into him, okay?

24:32.405 --> 24:34.207
But it's like,
why do we have to be so rigid?

24:34.240 --> 24:35.775
You know, why do we have to have
all these rules

24:35.809 --> 24:37.376
and labels and things?

24:37.410 --> 24:39.378
It's like, why-why do we have
to put people in boxes?

24:39.412 --> 24:42.115
You know?
Why-why even call a box a box?

24:42.148 --> 24:44.617
I think it's just easier
to have words.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.319
Easier for who? Not the box.

24:46.352 --> 24:48.187
Maybe the box
wants to do its own thing.

24:48.221 --> 24:49.723
You ever think of that?

24:50.824 --> 24:52.558
Okay, I'm-I'm confused.

24:52.591 --> 24:54.393
Do you want to bang Darulio?

24:54.427 --> 24:57.463
Bang, be banged, but why you
so hung up on labels, man?

24:57.496 --> 24:58.965
You know what?
You're the problem.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.734
You are the problem.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.635
You know what, instead
of frantically labeling people

25:02.668 --> 25:04.971
all day long, why don't you
take a look in the mirror? Huh?

25:05.004 --> 25:06.239
Do that for a change.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.841
God, you should be happy for me.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.642
I don't... Wait.
What time is it? Oh, my God.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.377
I'm late.
Listen, you gonna be up later?

25:11.410 --> 25:13.146
'Cause I'm gonna give you
a call. All right?

25:13.179 --> 25:14.848
Talk to you soon.

25:14.881 --> 25:18.184
(door whooshes open and shut)

25:18.217 --> 25:19.986
I'm telling you,
she's acting really weird.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.721
It's like
she's not even herself.

25:21.755 --> 25:23.322
Could be drugs.

25:23.356 --> 25:26.259
-Our first officer
is not on drugs. -Uh, wake up.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.728
This whole ship's on drugs.

25:28.762 --> 25:31.064
Excuse me. I would like to know

25:31.097 --> 25:32.732
when we can expect the results

25:32.766 --> 25:34.233
of the tests on the artifact.

25:34.267 --> 25:35.434
They should be available soon.

25:35.468 --> 25:37.336
Neither your captain
nor your first officer

25:37.370 --> 25:39.038
have responded to my messages.

25:39.072 --> 25:41.240
Is it your custom
to ignore your guests?

25:41.274 --> 25:43.276
There's Captain Mercer now.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.778
I'm sure he can give you
any updates you may need.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.849
Captain, I have been trying
to reach you for two hours.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.550
My people are becoming restless.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.086
Look, just hang tight.
We'll have some info soon.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.921
The Bruidians
are openly hostile to us.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.956
We do not wish to remain
on the same vessel with them

25:56.990 --> 25:58.391
-any longer than we must.
-Look, just relax.

25:58.424 --> 26:00.626
Okay? We'll have
this whole thing sorted out

26:00.659 --> 26:03.462
-in no time. Excuse me.
-(stammers)

26:06.599 --> 26:07.867
Hey.

26:07.901 --> 26:10.904
Hmm. So, I'm standing

26:10.937 --> 26:12.405
-in this huge line
for the bathroom... -Hey there.

26:12.438 --> 26:14.307
Hey. Have a seat.
Kelly's just in the middle

26:14.340 --> 26:16.242
-of telling a story.
-Oh.

26:16.275 --> 26:19.212
-Great.
-Anyway,

26:19.245 --> 26:20.914
so I overhear

26:20.947 --> 26:23.216
my Interspecies Diplomacy
professor bragging

26:23.249 --> 26:24.750
to a bunch of people
about how he thought I wanted

26:24.784 --> 26:27.220
-to hook up with him, and...
-With Professor Fincher?

26:27.253 --> 26:29.088
-Yes! The same.
-What?

26:29.122 --> 26:30.423
Such a scumbag, right?

26:30.456 --> 26:31.925
-So, then I walk up to him....
-Yeah, yeah.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.060
You pushed him in the pool. She
pushed him in the pool. Revenge!

26:34.093 --> 26:35.094
Girl power! Yay! Oh, my God.

26:35.128 --> 26:36.429
I've heard this story,
like, a thousand times.

26:36.462 --> 26:38.097
So, how was the rest
of your day?

26:38.131 --> 26:39.765
Ed, what are you doing here?

26:39.799 --> 26:41.734
Darulio and I made plans
to have a drink,

26:41.767 --> 26:43.169
so that's starting now.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.404
Our drink plan.

26:45.438 --> 26:48.341
-Well, why don't we just all
have a drink, then? -Sure.

26:48.374 --> 26:50.576
Well, actually, we had some
stuff that we wanted to discuss.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.178
Um... Oh, by the way,

26:52.211 --> 26:53.913
the Navarians are getting
kind of cranky over there.

26:53.947 --> 26:55.581
Maybe you could go distract them
with your breasts.

26:55.614 --> 26:56.916
You know what,
I'm gonna grab us a drink.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.818
-Everybody want a round?
-Sure.

26:58.852 --> 27:00.954
I'll have what you're having.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.457
What are you doing?
Are you messing with me?

27:04.490 --> 27:05.624
Is this punishment?

27:05.658 --> 27:07.626
Wow, what a narcissist you are.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.662
No, this is not punishment.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.097
I happen to think
he's a cool guy.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.499
You think he's a cool guy?

27:13.532 --> 27:14.667
Yeah, that's what I said.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.603
Are you wearing cologne?

27:17.636 --> 27:19.272
So?

27:19.305 --> 27:20.673
Did you pluck your eyebrows?

27:20.706 --> 27:22.608
No.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.143
Oh, I know these moves.

27:24.177 --> 27:25.979
These are your stupid moves.
You used them on me.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.280
What are you talking about?

27:27.313 --> 27:28.514
The accidental hand touching?

27:28.547 --> 27:30.316
The excessive grooming?

27:30.349 --> 27:32.852
I hate to break it to you,
but you're not his type.

27:32.886 --> 27:34.453
Well, we'll just see
about that, won't we?

27:34.487 --> 27:35.821
Oh, this is gonna be so sad.

27:35.855 --> 27:36.890
Yeah, maybe for you.

27:36.923 --> 27:38.457
-Hey, hey.
-Hey.

27:38.491 --> 27:41.060
-Here you go.
Let's have a toast. -Ah.

27:41.094 --> 27:43.229
To old friends.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.231
To new beginnings.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.572
Commander,
the Bruidians are asking

27:53.606 --> 27:54.740
to speak with the bridge.

27:54.773 --> 27:55.741
Put them through.

27:57.443 --> 27:58.577
Good day, Ambassador.

27:58.611 --> 28:01.080
I trust you slept well
last night.

28:01.114 --> 28:03.082
Where is the captain?

28:03.116 --> 28:04.817
I am Lieutenant Commander
Bortus.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.019
Captain Mercer is attending

28:06.052 --> 28:07.987
-to other matters.
-We have reason to believe

28:08.021 --> 28:10.723
that the Navarians are exerting
an influence over the test,

28:10.756 --> 28:12.691
and I have not been able
to reach Captain Mercer

28:12.725 --> 28:14.327
or Commander Grayson.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.363
I assure you, no one
is getting special treatment.

28:17.396 --> 28:20.566
I want to speak
to Captain Mercer.

28:20.599 --> 28:22.568
I will look into the matter
and contact you soon.

28:22.601 --> 28:23.903
Bridge out.

28:23.937 --> 28:26.405
Where are the captain
and the commander?

28:26.439 --> 28:28.541
The last time I saw them,
they were in the mess hall.

28:28.574 --> 28:30.576
But, sir...

28:30.609 --> 28:33.179
the commander's
been acting very weird lately.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.280
Weird?

28:34.313 --> 28:38.117
Well, she's, like,
obsessed with Darulio.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.385
-It's all she talks about.
-You know,

28:39.418 --> 28:40.786
Ed's been acting really strange

28:40.819 --> 28:42.221
with Darulio, too.

28:42.255 --> 28:44.890
He seems... kind of into him.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.460
What do you mean "into him"?

28:47.493 --> 28:49.062
I mean, into him.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.729
Your statement is confusing.

28:50.763 --> 28:54.067
Has the captain entered
Mr. Darulio in some fashion?

28:54.100 --> 28:55.568
Not yet.

28:55.601 --> 28:57.870
Marcus, Ty.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.438
What are you guys doing
on the bridge?

28:59.472 --> 29:01.374
My mom's been locked
in her office for hours,

29:01.407 --> 29:03.642
and she won't answer the door.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.816
(door chimes)

29:11.951 --> 29:14.420
Claire, are you in there?

29:21.460 --> 29:23.296
Oh, my God!

29:27.666 --> 29:29.602
(sighs)

29:40.146 --> 29:42.415
(breathing heavily)

29:42.448 --> 29:45.251
All right.
Now, what can I do for you?

29:45.284 --> 29:47.353
What the hell
did I just walk in on?

29:47.386 --> 29:49.455
Yeah, you're lucky
I'm so easygoing.

29:49.488 --> 29:52.091
There's a little thing
called privacy, you know.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.793
Claire, we are in sickbay.

29:54.827 --> 29:55.961
And you were just doing

29:55.995 --> 29:57.763
I don't know what with Yaphit.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.198
You hate Yaphit!

29:59.232 --> 30:01.434
Alara, I just never gave him
a chance.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.968
But when I finally

30:03.002 --> 30:05.438
allowed myself to take down
my walls, I realized

30:05.471 --> 30:07.706
what an idiot I've been.

30:07.740 --> 30:09.442
Yaphit and I are soul mates.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.110
We're going to get married.

30:11.144 --> 30:12.945
Yeah, a lot of soul mates
around here lately.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.480
My God!

30:14.513 --> 30:15.948
You should be happy for me.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.383
I'm in love.

30:17.416 --> 30:18.651
(over comm):
Bortus to Lieutenant Kitan.

30:18.684 --> 30:21.254
Hang on.
Just... stay right there.

30:22.388 --> 30:25.291
(sighs) Go ahead.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.892
The Bruidians and the Navarians
are both threatening

30:26.925 --> 30:28.394
to withdraw from the agreement

30:28.427 --> 30:31.297
-and to settle their conflict
in battle. -Oh, great.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.132
The computer shows
the captain and the commander

30:33.166 --> 30:35.201
near Science Lab 1,
but they are not responding.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.370
I'm on my way there.
Tell the delegates to stand by.

30:37.403 --> 30:38.737
Are you all done in there?

30:38.771 --> 30:40.239
I want to go for round two.

30:40.273 --> 30:41.640
Yaphit, listen to me.

30:41.674 --> 30:43.376
You are not to have any contact
with Claire

30:43.409 --> 30:44.810
until I figure out
what's going on.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.212
-Understand?
-Hey, man,

30:46.245 --> 30:48.314
the jelly wants
what the jelly wants.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.083
Not today.
I am giving you a direct order.

30:50.116 --> 30:52.085
Go back to your quarters,
and do not answer the door.

30:52.118 --> 30:53.586
Wait, wh-why?

30:53.619 --> 30:56.522
Because I said so!

30:57.623 --> 31:00.726
You have beautiful hands.

31:00.759 --> 31:03.262
Thank you. Well, based on

31:03.296 --> 31:04.497
the computer's progress,

31:04.530 --> 31:06.165
we should have our answers
very shortly.

31:06.199 --> 31:07.433
(sighs) You're a genius.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.202
(door whooshes open)

31:09.235 --> 31:11.837
Hey, Dar. Hey, listen,

31:11.870 --> 31:13.539
I know
it's your last night here,

31:13.572 --> 31:15.374
and since you have to work late,

31:15.408 --> 31:16.742
I made us a little dinner.

31:16.775 --> 31:18.444
Some sandwiches. Banana bread.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.446
-Bottle of rosé.
-That is so sweet.

31:20.479 --> 31:21.947
Oh, it's just like the dinner
I made for you

31:21.980 --> 31:23.582
when you were studying
for your officer's exam.

31:23.616 --> 31:25.618
This isn't your dry-ass
banana bread, Kelly.

31:25.651 --> 31:27.186
This is my own recipe.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.687
I thought maybe we could have
a little picnic,

31:28.721 --> 31:29.955
just you and me.

31:29.988 --> 31:31.424
Oh, sounds great.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.926
But I-I thought
we were gonna watch a movie.

31:33.959 --> 31:37.230
Oh. W-Well,
Ed was being so thoughtful,

31:37.263 --> 31:39.532
and I'd hate for all
that good food to go to waste.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.267
Okay.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.801
(door whooshes open)

31:42.835 --> 31:44.537
Commander, the delegates
are at the boiling point.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.071
I really think now's the time
for that mediation.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.873
Oh, they've been squawkin'
since they got here.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.808
-They'll be fine.
-Sir.

31:49.842 --> 31:51.277
I really think it's important.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.246
Besides, I need to talk
to Darulio, anyway.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.481
There's been a technical issue
with his security clearance.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.416
It's fine. We'll go.

31:57.450 --> 31:59.418
Ed didn't have
any other plans, anyway.

31:59.452 --> 32:00.653
All right, fine.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.990
-Dinner in my quarters after?
-Deal.

32:05.023 --> 32:07.326
Yes!

32:08.594 --> 32:09.928
Alara to Isaac.

32:09.962 --> 32:11.497
Do me a favor
and escort the delegates

32:11.530 --> 32:12.731
to the conference room.

32:12.765 --> 32:13.832
ISAAC (over comm):
Yes, Lieutenant.

32:13.866 --> 32:15.668
Okay, what the hell's
going on here?

32:15.701 --> 32:17.436
What are you talking about?

32:17.470 --> 32:18.837
I want to know what you're doing

32:18.871 --> 32:21.240
to the captain,
the commander and Dr. Finn.

32:21.274 --> 32:23.909
They're all acting like
insane teenagers, and it started

32:23.942 --> 32:26.279
when you came on board. Talk.

32:26.312 --> 32:29.582
Okay, you got me.

32:29.615 --> 32:32.084
Once a year, members
of my species go through heat.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.486
We release a pheromone

32:33.519 --> 32:36.422
though our skin
to help us attract mates.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.523
It's transferred through touch.

32:37.556 --> 32:38.924
I didn't mean to affect Ed

32:38.957 --> 32:40.693
and Kelly,
but it probably happened

32:40.726 --> 32:42.661
when we shook hands
in the shuttle bay.

32:42.695 --> 32:43.929
And now they're both
in artificial,

32:43.962 --> 32:45.264
crippling love with you.

32:45.298 --> 32:46.499
Oh, there's nothing artificial
about it.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.100
They're experiencing feelings.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.502
Chemically induced feelings,

32:49.535 --> 32:51.370
I grant you,
but feelings nonetheless.

32:51.404 --> 32:54.106
And what about Claire?
Why is she all into Yaphit?

32:54.139 --> 32:57.176
I tripped over Yaphit
in the corridor.

32:57.210 --> 33:00.679
His gelatinous membrane must
have absorbed my pheromones,

33:00.713 --> 33:02.515
and then he transferred them
to the doctor somehow.

33:02.548 --> 33:05.284
He was bringing her flowers.

33:05.318 --> 33:07.620
A gelatinous life-form as
a Retepsian pheromonal carrier.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.322
(laughs) Could you believe it?

33:09.355 --> 33:11.457
Oh, so this is all just
a big joke to you.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.625
Look, it's harmless.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.293

33:14.327 --> 33:15.561
we all have great sex.

40:43.375 --> 40:45.944
GORDON: Sir, both fleets
have disengaged.

40:45.978 --> 40:47.212
They're heading away.

41:00.659 --> 41:03.095
Well, everything
looks good, Captain.

41:03.128 --> 41:04.596
How you feeling?

41:04.629 --> 41:06.364
Uh, I'm fine.

41:06.398 --> 41:08.100
Little weirded out,
but otherwise fine.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.434
How about you?

41:09.467 --> 41:11.036
Same.

41:11.069 --> 41:12.705
I'm not looking forward
to seeing Yaphit again,

41:12.738 --> 41:15.307
-I can tell you that much.
-Yeah.

41:15.340 --> 41:17.542
Nurse Park, I'm putting
a special commendation

41:17.575 --> 41:18.944
on your record.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.278
The medical computer
did the work, sir.

41:20.312 --> 41:22.114
I-It was just
a souped-up version

41:22.147 --> 41:24.983
of Mr. Darulio's pheromone.
All we had to do was embed it

41:25.017 --> 41:26.985
in the Bruidian's sweat glands,
and it was love at first sight.

41:27.019 --> 41:28.954
The only hard part was getting
them to shake hands.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.456
All right, I think
you're cleared for duty.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.425
Thanks, Doc.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.729
(door chimes)

41:36.762 --> 41:38.196
Come in.

41:41.433 --> 41:43.401
(Ed sighs)

41:46.671 --> 41:48.306
Listen, I...

41:48.340 --> 41:51.076
Can we just not talk about it?
Ever?

41:51.109 --> 41:52.911
You know, I was gonna
ask you the same thing,

41:52.945 --> 41:54.880
but I was afraid
I'd sound like a dick.

41:54.913 --> 41:56.749
You don't.

41:56.782 --> 41:58.917
Well, even so...

41:58.951 --> 42:00.886
I'm sorry.

42:02.454 --> 42:04.757
Well, we have a more immediate
problem anyway.

42:04.790 --> 42:07.092
What happens
when the pheromone wears off?

42:07.125 --> 42:09.161
The ambassadors are in love now,
but in a few days

42:09.194 --> 42:11.196
they'll remember
they hate each other again.

42:11.229 --> 42:13.031
Not necessarily.

42:13.065 --> 42:15.167
I just finished my analysis.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.869
It turns out the DNA
in the artifact

42:16.902 --> 42:19.371
is both Bruidian and Navarian.

42:19.404 --> 42:20.773
They have a common ancestor.

42:20.806 --> 42:23.008
They both have a claim
to Lopovius.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.709
They'll have to share it.

42:24.743 --> 42:27.179
Well, that makes things
a lot easier.

42:27.212 --> 42:30.382
Yes.

42:30.415 --> 42:31.583
Can I just say

42:31.616 --> 42:33.752
-that I feel kind of...
-Darulio.

42:33.786 --> 42:35.620
Thank you for your report.

42:35.653 --> 42:37.055
The Olympia has just arrived,

42:37.089 --> 42:38.490
and there's a shuttle
waiting for you.

42:41.459 --> 42:42.795
Okay.

42:42.828 --> 42:44.797
Darulio, wait.

42:47.432 --> 42:51.103
A year ago, when we met...

42:51.136 --> 42:52.670
were you in heat then?

42:56.741 --> 42:58.143
Maybe.

43:14.692 --> 43:17.629

Media Access Group at WGBH

43:59.804 --> 44:01.706
You've explored space
with The Orville.
