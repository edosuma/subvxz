WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:02.935
ANNOUNCER:<i> Thanks for</i>
<i>downloading this Fox show.</i>

00:02.937 --> 00:05.738
<i>And don't miss all-new episodes</i>
<i>only on Fox.</i>

00:09.944 --> 00:12.277
This loft has devolved
into chaos.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.679
You promised me if we had sex
this morning,

00:13.681 --> 00:14.947
you wouldn't get riled up.

00:14.949 --> 00:16.315
Sex was great. Blessings.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.516
But look at all this mail.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.952
Small-time drug dealers are
more organized than this.

00:19.954 --> 00:22.521
Oh, my God, my Uncle Lee
got married.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.622
This is what I'm talking about.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.491
Oh, my God, he died.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.658
Cece, what if that had been

00:26.660 --> 00:28.227
one of your college
acceptance letters?

00:28.229 --> 00:29.795
I'm transferring
to a four year university.

00:29.797 --> 00:30.796
It's no big deal.

00:30.798 --> 00:31.897
It's huge.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.732
You graduated
from a community college.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.434
It was a sight to behold.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.408
(clears throat)

00:42.410 --> 00:43.742
Cece Parikh.
That's me.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.310
(air horn blares)
Yay!

00:45.312 --> 00:48.313
I'm not gonna let you lose out
because our roommates

00:48.315 --> 00:50.049
are a bunch of railway cats.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.984
Clear your schedule.
We're organizing.

00:51.986 --> 00:53.585
Can't. I'm campaigning
with Jess today.

00:53.587 --> 00:54.319
Let's get ready

00:54.321 --> 00:56.355
to Rodham!

00:56.357 --> 00:58.290
("Pump Up the Jam"
by Technotronic plays)

01:05.332 --> 01:08.267
Y'all ready for
this... election?

01:08.269 --> 01:10.202
(vocalizes)
What on Earth

01:10.204 --> 01:11.537
are you celebrating?

01:11.539 --> 01:13.105
It's okay. We know
you're voting for Trump.

01:13.107 --> 01:14.173
Not on your life,

01:14.175 --> 01:16.575
nor am I voting
for that flip-flopping

01:16.577 --> 01:18.177
helmet head in a pantsuit.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.278
I'm only focused

01:19.280 --> 01:20.446
on one election.

01:20.448 --> 01:23.782
The election that matters:
Paul Ryan 2020.

01:23.784 --> 01:24.850
JESS:
All right.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.185
While you sit this one out,

01:26.187 --> 01:27.419
Cece and I

01:27.421 --> 01:28.520
are gonna register new voters

01:28.522 --> 01:29.721
and help Hillary prove

01:29.723 --> 01:31.457
that a woman's place
is in the house...

01:31.459 --> 01:33.192
BOTH:
The White House.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.193
The people's voice

01:34.195 --> 01:35.360
must be heard

01:35.362 --> 01:36.595
and that's what
I've always believed.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.431
As I see it,
we have two choices.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.233
Continue eating this pig slop

01:41.235 --> 01:43.202
that they call
butterscotch pudding

01:43.204 --> 01:45.971
or we can raise our voices
and demand

01:45.973 --> 01:49.475
for locally-sourced,
candied, Oregon apples!

01:49.477 --> 01:50.776
(cheering)

01:50.778 --> 01:54.413
You can silence me, but you
can't silence the people!

01:54.415 --> 01:57.116
This is not P.S.
Hippie Montessori.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.150
Nobody cares anymore.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.052
Democracy is dead.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.020
Wha...

02:01.021 --> 02:01.987
If you get five new voters,

02:01.989 --> 02:02.988
hell, you know what,

02:02.990 --> 02:04.056
I'll vote for Hillary.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.124
Excuse me?

02:05.126 --> 02:08.227
Things... just... got...
interesting.

02:08.229 --> 02:12.264
But if you don't, you have
to vote for Winston.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.133
Bishop?

02:14.135 --> 02:15.467
Winston Bishop?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.936
Game on,
you Republican minx.

02:17.938 --> 02:18.804
Hey, guys,

02:18.806 --> 02:20.239
if I win, I just want you

02:20.241 --> 02:21.440
to know there will be

02:21.442 --> 02:23.442
some things that come out
about me.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.944
Just ride it out.

02:25.946 --> 02:28.013
♪ ♪

02:30.618 --> 02:31.617
Reagan's in Seattle.

02:31.619 --> 02:32.784
Aly's at Quantico.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.153
And here we are,
you and me,

02:34.155 --> 02:35.354
working that long "D."

02:35.356 --> 02:36.321
The long what now?

02:36.323 --> 02:37.923
We're working the what?

02:37.925 --> 02:39.758
The long "D."
Long distance relationships.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.993
I mean, Aly and I

02:40.995 --> 02:42.327
have got it down to an art.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.163
Really? 'Cause I'm...

02:44.165 --> 02:46.198
I'm really struggling.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.201
In New Orleans, Reagan and I
had such an easy time talking,

02:49.203 --> 02:50.269
but now there's so much

02:50.271 --> 02:51.637
pressure that we just text.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.005
Just talk on the phone.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.307
I hate talking on the phone,
Winston.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.342
I feel like I'm exposing
my turd pipe.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.112
What?
I just know that I feel
cold and I'm terrified.

03:00.114 --> 03:03.382
Look, man, you got to understand
something about the long "D."

03:03.384 --> 03:05.217
At first, it's very hard.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.152
Okay? It's a lot to take.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.121
But the long "D"
in the end is...

03:09.123 --> 03:11.123
(chuckling):
very much worth it.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.324
You have to see
what you're doing here.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.359
Right now you're having
problems.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.460
I'm not. You know why?

03:15.462 --> 03:16.528
'Cause you love the long "D."

03:16.530 --> 03:17.863
I've adjusted to the long "D."

03:17.865 --> 03:19.398
Okay.
Sometimes it's rough.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.166
Yeah, can be bumpy road
sometimes, man.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.401
The long "D" can be bumpy.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.303
Ooh!
Sometimes there's
unexpected curves.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.338
Don't I know it.
But once it breaks you
down a little bit,

03:26.340 --> 03:27.372
you learn to like the long "D."

03:27.374 --> 03:28.507
You're gonna say
something like that?

03:28.509 --> 03:29.875
You get used to it
is what I'm saying.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.645
I think I'm done with this.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.347
(Cece chuckles)

03:35.349 --> 03:36.348
Hello.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.650
JESS:
Hello.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.719
Two canvassers
reporting for duty.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.887
Jessica Day,

03:41.889 --> 03:43.655
school administrator.
Cecilia Parikh,

03:43.657 --> 03:44.890
community college
graduate,

03:44.892 --> 03:46.225
soon to be transferred

03:46.227 --> 03:47.209
to a four year university.

03:47.210 --> 03:48.192
I don't have time for this.
Well, actually...

03:48.195 --> 03:49.228
She doesn't know
which one yet.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.362
Yeah, I haven't
been accepted.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.730
I don't have time
to listen to you.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.731
Sure.
Oh, no.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.100
Just be respectful, informative.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.568
Hillary Clinton
was born in 1947

03:56.570 --> 03:58.103
and her parents are
Hugh and Dorothy.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.104
Woman won a Grammy.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.072
That's a fact.

04:00.074 --> 04:02.574
BOTH:
Takes a village.

04:03.844 --> 04:04.876
Try phone duty.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.211
Great.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.713
Quick question.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.380
I've perfected

04:08.382 --> 04:09.781
five different,

04:09.783 --> 04:12.184
assertive,
female voices.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.852
You tell me which one
you'd like me to use.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.420
(high-pitched): Hi.
(in a deep voice): Hey.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.389
Hello.
(in a British accent): Good day.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.857
(in a deep voice): 'Sup.
That was one.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.461
What is so genius
about the new system

04:22.463 --> 04:24.296
is that it's completely
self-explanatory.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.398
Now, let's say you
get a heating bill.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.133
Where does it go?
Oh.
(chuckles)

04:28.135 --> 04:30.135
Didn't know I was
gonna be quizzed.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.207
Loft bills.

04:35.209 --> 04:36.842
That's right.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.476
And do not put that
in the old mail, soy sauce,

04:38.479 --> 04:39.544
dead battery drawer.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.813
Wh...

04:41.815 --> 04:42.914
What?

04:42.916 --> 04:44.816
What?

04:44.818 --> 04:47.219
What is this drawer?

04:47.221 --> 04:48.553
Take me to the drawer, Winston.

04:48.555 --> 04:49.621
Where is it?

04:50.924 --> 04:52.991
(gasps dramatically)

04:55.229 --> 04:56.228
I didn't...

04:56.230 --> 04:57.296
The hell is this?!

04:57.298 --> 04:58.730
Uh... some...
some of everything.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.332
When you cut the belly open
of a shark

05:00.334 --> 05:01.733
and just everything topples out.

05:04.305 --> 05:07.439
Have you people
all just given up?

05:07.441 --> 05:08.373
Well, hang on.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.177
It's Cal State L.A.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.278
This is Cece's first
admissions letter.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.347
Oh.
I got to get
this to her.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.916
Winston!
I hope you're happy!

05:17.918 --> 05:18.917
I showed her my turd pipe.

05:18.919 --> 05:19.918
I don't know

05:19.920 --> 05:21.286
what's going on
in your lives,

05:21.288 --> 05:22.954
but we need to start eating
dinner together again.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.323
Mm-mm.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.059
Oh.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.328
You got in my head.

05:29.330 --> 05:32.030
I decided to call Reagan
and it went horribly.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.265
Hi, this is Nick.

05:33.267 --> 05:35.334
Yeah, Nick Miller, boyfriend.
Boyfriend.

05:35.336 --> 05:36.335
(imitating Southern accent):
What you got?

05:36.337 --> 05:37.669
Why am I talking this way?
Hi.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.770
Talking, me talking.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.339
You listening, you listening.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.407
(talking incoherently)

05:43.811 --> 05:45.510
Next thing I knew,
I was saying the words

05:45.512 --> 05:48.814
"phone" and "sex"
and now she expects phone sex.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.382
Nick, relax, man.
Help me.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.616
I'm screwed, Winston.
I'm gonna lose her.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.652
My friend, you are not gonna
lose her, okay?

05:53.654 --> 05:56.121
Phone sex is old school.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.956
That's how our nanas got nasty.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.341
True, true, true.

05:59.342 --> 06:00.725
They'd be like,
"What you wearing, Gertrude?"

06:00.728 --> 06:03.328
She'd be like,
"My bloom... bloomers.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.330
Pull down those trousers
and let me see that thing."

06:05.332 --> 06:08.367
(chuckles) But... thanks
to technology, hmm,

06:08.369 --> 06:11.670
there's plenty other ways you
can get sensual with your lady.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.739
Welcome...

06:13.741 --> 06:18.810
to the Winston Bishop Clinic for
Satellite Sexual Intercourse.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.011
Eh?

06:20.013 --> 06:21.546
This is how you do phone sex?

06:21.548 --> 06:23.348
Video sex, Nick.

06:23.350 --> 06:24.883
Aloha.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.652
Beautiful girl on
a beautiful day in Hawaii.

06:27.654 --> 06:28.353
Ooh.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.521
Let's make love

06:29.523 --> 06:31.356
for the Japanese bombers.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.357
Oh, my God!

06:32.359 --> 06:33.325
They're bombing us! No!

06:33.327 --> 06:34.760
No!

06:34.762 --> 06:37.295
You know we share
a wall, right?
Mm...

06:41.935 --> 06:43.101
On envelopes.
Really?
Ugh.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.204
We are not making a
damn diff in here, Cece.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.706
Stuffing paper.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.408
If ten-year-old Jess
could see me now...

06:49.410 --> 06:51.877
You know, she'd be really
proud of your knockers.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.078
I never saw that coming.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.112
Well, that's a fair point.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.281
I did exceed expectations.

06:56.283 --> 06:57.449
Mm.
But you know what?

06:57.451 --> 06:59.084
We need to get off the bench

06:59.086 --> 07:00.886
and we need to go prove
Schmidt wrong.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.955
So, we need a list
of potential new voters

07:03.957 --> 07:05.891
and I know
just the tired,

07:05.893 --> 07:08.293
cranky broad who has one.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.762
Hey.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.998
Thought you could use a hot cup.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.768
So, when the dust settles,
what's, uh...

07:16.770 --> 07:18.570
what's next for the supervisor?

07:18.572 --> 07:20.071
My name is Mary Ellen
and I haven't

07:20.073 --> 07:21.206
thought about myself in weeks.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.541
Oh, well, best of luck.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.610
Piece of cake, Cece.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.546
Sign up five new voters.
We'll be done by noon.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.713
Yes!
Yes!

07:28.715 --> 07:31.149
Hi, do you have a minute
to talk about Hillary?

07:31.151 --> 07:32.951
I'm voting for her.

07:32.953 --> 07:33.952
Would you like to...

07:33.954 --> 07:35.320
Hillary Cli...

07:36.423 --> 07:37.823
Yes?

07:37.825 --> 07:39.424
(chuckles)
You know who
you look like?

07:39.426 --> 07:41.393
I am not Bernie Sanders.

07:41.395 --> 07:42.394
I am Marshall Stevens

07:42.396 --> 07:43.962
and for the last year
and a half,

07:43.964 --> 07:46.631
my life has been a living hell!

07:46.633 --> 07:48.467
(door slams)
Okay.

07:49.303 --> 07:50.335
So, this is what all the kids

07:50.337 --> 07:51.403
are talking about these days?

07:51.405 --> 07:53.572
Yep. Yeah.
Video sex?

07:53.574 --> 07:55.841
Do you clean this thing
regularly?

07:55.843 --> 07:57.142
I thi--

07:57.144 --> 07:58.510
Why are you looking up?
(phone chiming)

07:58.512 --> 08:00.846
That's her.
She wants to do it now.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.248
(whooping)
I like her style.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.783
A little afternoon delight.

08:04.785 --> 08:05.984
Yeah.
Okay,

08:05.986 --> 08:06.985
let's pick out a backdrop.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.487
Where do you want to
get naughty?

08:08.489 --> 08:10.455
Paris? Rome?

08:10.457 --> 08:12.924
Huh? Drink a little tea?
That's not sexy.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.694
Afric-- nah,
you don't want to...

08:15.696 --> 08:17.362
Outer space?

08:18.332 --> 08:19.798
You can do it in space?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.199
Oh, yes, Nick.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.200
You can.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.603
And you will.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.638
JESS:
Wait. This is a sorority house.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.274
It's probably a house
full of unregistered voters.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.542
I hear you, I do,

08:30.544 --> 08:33.678
but there's nothing scarier
to me than sorority girls.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.014
Hey, you got the keg?
'Cause we're almost tapped

08:36.016 --> 08:37.516
and I'm like, "What?"

08:38.485 --> 08:40.318
(clears throat) Um,

08:40.320 --> 08:42.053
are you ladies
planning to vote?

08:42.055 --> 08:43.288
Yeah, bye.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.289
(door closes)

08:44.291 --> 08:46.358
Is she gone?
(phone buzzing)

08:46.360 --> 08:47.726
I stood frozen like
you're supposed to

08:47.728 --> 08:49.327
when you see a bear
in the woods.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.162
Hold on a sec.
Hey, babe.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.163
Where are you? I'm--

08:52.165 --> 08:53.365
I'm at the Phish concert

08:53.367 --> 08:55.634
that you call a campaign office.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.235
And I have your first
admissions letter!

08:57.237 --> 08:58.203
We're just actually out
canvassing right now.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.804
I'll open it
when I get home.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.573
That's not gonna work for me.
I'm gonna open it now.

09:01.575 --> 09:02.908
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Well, don't...

09:02.910 --> 09:03.808
Sorry. I can't hear you

09:03.810 --> 09:05.844
over the sound of me opening it.

09:05.846 --> 09:06.912
You got into college!

09:06.914 --> 09:08.013
You got into college!

09:08.015 --> 09:09.014
I got into college.

09:09.016 --> 09:12.017
You got into college?
(chuckling)

09:12.019 --> 09:13.552
Cece got into college.
Congratulations.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.819
Ah, whatever.

09:14.821 --> 09:15.854
(whispering):
Don't tell Schmidt

09:15.856 --> 09:17.222
we haven't gotten
any new voters.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.390
Tell Jess that
I'm not surprised,
Okay.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.925
and her whispers
are like screams.

09:19.927 --> 09:20.926
Hey!
Whoa. All right.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.027
The day's not done.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.762
Money and special interests,
Jess.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.164
Let me hear you say it:
democracy is dead.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.432
Democracy is...

09:27.434 --> 09:29.601
alive.

09:29.603 --> 09:30.735
He got where I was going.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.471
Whew.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.009
Let's find you a home.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.778
Thank you.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.682
Oh.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.721
SUPERVISOR: Uh, we lost
a couple of deadbeats

09:49.723 --> 09:51.456
over in envelopes.
We need you there.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.724
I'm not one of you people.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.292
I'm very sorry.
I'm a Repu... Hmm.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.096
I'm repulsed by
that garbage dump

09:58.098 --> 09:59.731
you call an envelope station.

09:59.733 --> 10:02.033
Great. Then organize it.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.401
No.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.503
(phones ringing)

10:06.306 --> 10:09.441
(singsongy):
I'm-a make a system.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.875
I couldn't see the smug look
on Schmidt's face,

10:10.877 --> 10:12.110
but I could feel it.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.411
I'll be damned
if I cast a vote

10:13.413 --> 10:14.412
for Bishop/Furguson.

10:14.414 --> 10:15.447
Wait, where-where
are you going?

10:15.449 --> 10:17.248
Back to the coven
of Greek sirens.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.550
I say we go in hard,

10:18.552 --> 10:20.251
with the violent history
of the suffragette,

10:20.253 --> 10:23.555
and then, we ease into
some light reproductive rights.

10:23.557 --> 10:24.889
That is one way to do it.

10:24.891 --> 10:25.890
Or...

10:25.892 --> 10:28.393
Who's ready to party?

10:28.395 --> 10:29.628
And gab about
the kind of world

10:29.630 --> 10:31.496
we want to leave
our grandchildren!

10:33.266 --> 10:35.400
Hopefully one that's
full of parties!

10:35.402 --> 10:36.801

10:36.803 --> 10:38.269
You're gonna
graduate soon, okay?

10:38.271 --> 10:40.238
So, this is your turn
to really speak up

10:40.240 --> 10:41.906
and make a difference...
And it's your turn to drink!

10:41.908 --> 10:43.908
Oh, okay.
All right, just, um, okay...

10:43.910 --> 10:46.745
I love you, booze girl.
Take a shot!

10:46.747 --> 10:47.812
Oh, no. I don't...
Shot!

10:47.814 --> 10:49.014
I don't want to take a shot,

10:49.016 --> 10:51.916
but I do want you to sign up
to vote.

10:51.918 --> 10:55.120
I can't sign it
if you don't take a shot.

10:55.122 --> 10:58.323
That's such a good argument.
Okay.

You all have ten shots

11:09.636 --> 11:12.437
But, if you share the wealth,

11:12.439 --> 11:15.206
then we can all
throw up together.

In ten hours, I'll be dead.

Excellent.

I like your work, new guy.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.635
I need you on the phones.

12:50.637 --> 12:51.402
What about my 'lopes?

12:51.404 --> 12:53.404
Nope. Phones.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.939
Just read the script.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.708
Okay, fine.
But only one call.

12:56.710 --> 12:59.444
That's it. And then I'm taking
my talents back to mailers.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.980
Yes, hello.

I'm calling to remind you
to vote for a better America

13:04.651 --> 13:07.051
and a vote for a better America
is a vote for Hubbedy Bubbedy.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.787
Hillary Clinton.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.088
That's what I said.
Hibiddy Bibbidy.

It's Hillary.

You check your facts. Check--

14:56.596 --> 14:59.664
fought to give you a voice.

herself in front of a horse.

sidelines and let someone else

dictate your futures,
or you can speak up

15:19.920 --> 15:21.352
and take charge of your lives.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.588
Now, if you're not
willing to do that,

15:23.590 --> 15:24.756
then shame on you.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.124
But if you are,

15:26.126 --> 15:27.292
then I want to hear your voice.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.527
Where are you...

15:40.407 --> 15:41.406
Where you at?

15:41.408 --> 15:43.408

15:43.410 --> 15:44.409

Booze girl! Booze girl!
Booze girl!

16:12.238 --> 16:15.473
All right, now I need

16:15.475 --> 16:16.975
The forms are all filled up.

16:16.977 --> 16:20.445
Well, then let's march

Aly saw my ass in space,

16:47.974 --> 16:49.440
Reagan still wants
to have phone sex with me,

16:49.442 --> 16:53.311
and I just panic-ordered
$200 worth of Chinese food.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.612
You know what, man?
That's on me, I...

16:54.614 --> 16:55.880
I pushed you to use my style

16:55.882 --> 16:58.016
when I should have
encouraged you to use your own.

16:58.018 --> 17:01.686
Winston, if I had any style,
I would call my girlfriend

17:01.688 --> 17:04.522
instead of using my best
friend's electronic sex shed.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.393
"Every moment
you're on this Earth,

17:08.395 --> 17:10.461
is a moment I know
where you are."

17:10.463 --> 17:11.462
You know who wrote that?

17:11.464 --> 17:12.897
The great James Baldwin.

17:12.899 --> 17:15.033
No, you wr-- James Baldwin?

17:15.035 --> 17:16.067
What?

17:16.069 --> 17:17.835
Look, man, you
sent me these cards

17:17.837 --> 17:19.404
when I was playing
basketball in Latvia.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.472
And, I don't know,
I kept all of them.

17:21.474 --> 17:22.673
They're beautiful, man.

17:22.675 --> 17:25.243
"I screamed your name
at the ocean today,

17:25.245 --> 17:29.147
then I ate a sandwich that
tasted like your smile."

17:29.149 --> 17:31.182
I wrote that to you?
Yeah.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.151
Boy, we used to be a lot closer.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.386
This is your style, man.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.488
Use it.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.490
Thank you.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.359
Hey, uh, Reagan,

17:41.361 --> 17:43.695
this is Nick Miller.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.030
You said you wanted phone sex,
so, here you go.

17:46.032 --> 17:47.498
Here's your phone sex.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.169
Get ready to, uh, have a...
an orgasm, I guess.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.271
When I'm done with, uh...
I'll just start.

17:53.273 --> 17:57.341

Yeah. Oh, yeah,
that's-that's Winston.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.852
Yeah, he's in here to help,
he's actually been very helpful.

18:07.854 --> 18:11.189
What's up, girl?
He says "What's up, girl?"

18:11.191 --> 18:13.791
Oh, yeah, I'll def...
Yeah, makes perfect sense.

18:13.793 --> 18:14.792

Okay. Bye, Reagan.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.232
No, Winston, I mean it.
She brings up a valid point.

18:21.234 --> 18:24.202
We're about to do
phone sex, and...
I'm walking out...

18:24.204 --> 18:25.403
All right, Winston,
take off.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.538
Sure. For sure.
No, Winston, I mean it.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.773
This is me telling you
as Nick.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.576
I would like you to leave.
As Nick. Ooh!

18:31.578 --> 18:32.810
Hit the road.

Yeah.

Yeah.

but you want to grab brunch

No.

want to go to college,
