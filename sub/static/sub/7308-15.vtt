WEBVTT

00:10.294 --> 00:12.421
ls it just me,
or are we getting faster at this?

00:12.588 --> 00:15.216
Faster is five cars
in one night, newbie.

00:15.966 --> 00:18.385
- You hear that?
- Sounds like money to me.

00:27.394 --> 00:29.188
Now that's what l'm talking about.

00:29.355 --> 00:32.524
This baby is loaded:
GPS navi, killer sound.

00:32.691 --> 00:34.276
We're gonna get three G's
for these rims.

00:34.443 --> 00:36.028
More if the spare's alloy.

00:40.366 --> 00:41.992
- What?
- NClS.

00:42.159 --> 00:43.410
- Don't shoot.
- Freeze!

00:43.577 --> 00:45.538
- Hands in the air.
- Okay, okay.

00:46.789 --> 00:48.624
- All right. All right.
- Cuff them.

00:48.791 --> 00:50.334
- Against the car, dirtbag.
- On the car.

00:50.501 --> 00:52.044
- Assume the position.
- Okay. Okay.

00:52.211 --> 00:55.381
Your first mistake was stealing tools
from the motor pool, geniuses.

00:57.216 --> 01:00.386
Yeah, it's Gibbs. l need
prison transportation for three.

01:00.553 --> 01:04.515
Get ahold of Metro P.D.
We busted these guys on their turf.

01:04.682 --> 01:05.724
Gibbs?

01:06.850 --> 01:08.227
You have the right to remain silent.

01:08.394 --> 01:10.229
Car's not the only thing
they've been chopping.

02:05.618 --> 02:07.786
l swear we didn't kill anybody.
lt's not even our cooler.

02:07.953 --> 02:10.288
We had nothing to do with that.

02:11.081 --> 02:12.124
Do you believe him?

02:12.291 --> 02:15.085
They had a human head
in the trunk of a car, McGee.

02:15.252 --> 02:17.046
What do you think?

02:22.176 --> 02:24.136
First severed head?

02:24.845 --> 02:29.642
Mine was a motorcycle accident
in Baltimore.

02:29.808 --> 02:33.562
- l thought l was picking up a helmet--
- lt's worse when you know the person.

02:35.397 --> 02:37.358
You knew someone
who was beheaded?

02:37.524 --> 02:39.151
A friend.

02:41.612 --> 02:47.576
He infiltrated a Hamas cell
in Ramallah.

02:49.411 --> 02:51.330
They sent his head

02:51.914 --> 02:53.874
overnight express.

02:54.959 --> 02:58.629
- l'm sorry. l didn't--
- That's when l decided l'd...

03:00.756 --> 03:02.675
l'd never be captured alive.

03:08.430 --> 03:10.766
You did me a favour tonight, Jethro.

03:10.933 --> 03:14.436
<i>Tonight is SmackDown night
at the Mallard residence.</i>

03:14.603 --> 03:15.854
Can you believe it?

03:16.021 --> 03:18.440
Mother's favourite television program:
Wrestling.

03:18.774 --> 03:21.110
Mine too. l love the WWE.

03:21.277 --> 03:24.738
l haven't the heart to tell her
it's not real.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.448
Where's the body?

03:26.615 --> 03:28.701
Three sailors running
a chop shop, Duck.

03:28.868 --> 03:30.035
We found it in the trunk.

03:30.202 --> 03:32.955
You're not gonna need
the gurney for this one, Palmer.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.877
Oh, my.

03:39.545 --> 03:40.880
Decapitation.

03:41.046 --> 03:43.924
A most ancient form of execution,

03:44.258 --> 03:47.386
which the French elevated
to a public spectacle.

03:47.595 --> 03:48.804
The guillotine.

03:52.474 --> 03:54.977
The French Revolution.
Scissors, please.

03:56.520 --> 04:02.109
Actually, the hideous machine
was invented by a doctor,

04:02.276 --> 04:03.986
Joseph Guillotin.

04:04.737 --> 04:07.281
He proposed his machine be used,

04:07.448 --> 04:11.243
as it was a humane form
of capital punishment.

04:11.410 --> 04:13.329
- That's ironic.
- Yes, l'd say.

04:13.495 --> 04:16.749
Although the guillotine
is mostly associated with the French,

04:16.957 --> 04:19.584
the Nazis actually
guillotined more people

04:19.752 --> 04:21.670
than the entire French Revolution.

04:21.837 --> 04:23.505
- That's pretty gruesome.
- lndeed.

04:23.672 --> 04:25.966
Hitler thought it was a demeaning
form of punishment,

04:26.133 --> 04:28.510
so he used it for political executions.

04:28.677 --> 04:30.679
l was referring to the severed head,
Ducky.

04:30.846 --> 04:34.099
Do you know how many people
the Nazis decapitated

04:34.266 --> 04:37.144
between 1 942 and 1 943?

04:38.562 --> 04:41.774
- No.
- Over 20,000.

04:41.941 --> 04:44.985
l never cease to be amazed by
the depth of your knowledge, doctor.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.946
Yes, well, one thing
we can say for certain:

04:47.154 --> 04:50.282
Beheading was not the cause
of this poor man's demise.

04:50.449 --> 04:52.201
Look at the tissue reaction.

04:52.368 --> 04:56.330
lt isn't engorged with blood
from the severed capillaries and veins.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.624
So he was dead
before his head was removed?

04:58.791 --> 05:00.876
For what sicko reason
do you keep it preserved on ice?

05:01.043 --> 05:03.128
l don't know,
but it's gonna make determining

05:03.295 --> 05:05.214
the time of death impossible.

05:05.381 --> 05:09.885
As to cause, well,
without the rest of the body--

05:11.220 --> 05:13.889
Perhaps you can make us an l.D.

05:14.056 --> 05:16.058
Lay some tissue samples on me,
Duckman.

05:16.225 --> 05:18.769
l knew there was a reason
l invited you down here.

05:18.936 --> 05:23.649
Would you do the honours, Mr. Palmer?
l need to take care of the paperwork.

05:24.567 --> 05:28.070
So white meat or dark?

05:31.407 --> 05:33.450
lt's inappropriate?

05:34.201 --> 05:37.079
With a big dash of creepy, Jimmy.

05:37.246 --> 05:41.208
lt's my delivery.
l have to work on that.

05:43.252 --> 05:47.923
Who is Naomi Krutzhammer?
One of your girlfriends, yes?

05:48.090 --> 05:49.675
l'm trying to read my email here.
You mind?

05:49.842 --> 05:52.595
Not at all. l didn't know
your nickname was ''Honeybuns.''

05:52.803 --> 05:54.597
Only Naomi and l call him that.

05:54.763 --> 05:56.515
Didn't think you
were gonna say anything.

05:56.682 --> 05:58.100
Who owns the car with the head?

05:58.267 --> 06:00.436
- We don't know yet.
- You're reading your email

06:00.603 --> 06:02.563
and you don't know yet?

06:02.730 --> 06:05.190
We traced the VlN
to a Mercedes dealership in Riverdale,

06:05.357 --> 06:07.651
which sold it two weeks ago.
The registration is temporary

06:07.818 --> 06:09.570
and hasn't been processed
by the DMV.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.698
We called the dealership. They don't
open for another 25 minutes.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.785
The car's registered
to an Epsilon Corporation.

06:16.952 --> 06:18.120
Thanks for sharing, probie.

06:18.287 --> 06:22.208
l just found it. Had to hack
into the DMV's processing computer.

06:23.042 --> 06:25.127
- ls that legal?
- l doubt it.

06:25.544 --> 06:26.795
l wonder what the penalty is?

06:26.962 --> 06:29.882
Less than reading your emails
on my time, Honeybuns.

06:30.049 --> 06:32.468
Corporate address is in care
of Sean Oliver, attorney at law.

06:32.635 --> 06:34.220
225 Sheraton Street.

06:34.386 --> 06:36.305
- Phone number, McGee?
- When they answer the phone,

06:36.472 --> 06:38.641
what are you gonna say,
Officer David?

06:38.807 --> 06:41.393
''Hey, we found your car.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.063
Anybody at Epsilon
missing a head?''

06:45.397 --> 06:49.777
Tony, take Ziva with you. Go.

06:49.944 --> 06:51.320
That's a good job, McGee.

06:51.487 --> 06:53.572
- Thank you, boss.
- But Tony's right.

06:53.739 --> 06:55.908
Hacking is illegal.

07:02.331 --> 07:03.374
l hate lawyers.

07:03.541 --> 07:06.627
l thought lawyers were an integral part
of the American legal system.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.837
Defenders of civil liberties.

07:09.004 --> 07:11.173
This guy wouldn't know a civil liberty
if he choked on it.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.510
You don't get an office like this
working pro bono cases.

07:14.927 --> 07:16.554
You don't even know the man.

07:16.762 --> 07:18.597
l can tell you anything
you need to know.

07:19.765 --> 07:22.851
Okay, what does he look like?

07:23.894 --> 07:26.605
The name ''Sean'' was popular
in the 1 960's.

07:27.356 --> 07:28.649
l wonder why.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.025
That puts him in his 40s.

07:30.192 --> 07:33.195
Probably has a combover, balding,
maybe even plugs.

07:34.029 --> 07:35.698
Shall l continue?

07:35.906 --> 07:37.074
Well, you're on a roll.

07:37.241 --> 07:40.035
Oliver: Old money. Esquire?

07:40.828 --> 07:42.454
Cheeseball, pretentious.

07:42.621 --> 07:44.540
l'm sorry to keep you waiting.

07:44.707 --> 07:46.458
lf you'd follow me, please?

07:46.625 --> 07:49.211
Count your fingers
after you shake his hand.

07:51.130 --> 07:52.840
Okay, thanks.

07:54.383 --> 07:55.634
Of course, there are exceptions.

07:55.801 --> 07:58.721
So, what can l do for NClS today?

07:58.888 --> 08:01.223
- l'm Special Agent DiNozzo.
- Nice to meet you.

08:01.390 --> 08:05.227
We recovered a stolen Mercedes
registered at Epsilon Corporation

08:05.394 --> 08:08.063
- at this address.
- Epsilon's a client.

08:08.230 --> 08:10.149
l'm sure they'll appreciate
you finding their car.

08:10.316 --> 08:13.193
lt's a little more complicated than that.
ls it Mrs.?

08:13.360 --> 08:15.863
lt's Ms., and please call me Sean.

08:16.030 --> 08:18.073
Sean. Pretty name.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.326
- Thank you.
- You're a coach?

08:20.826 --> 08:22.244
No, not exactly.

08:22.411 --> 08:24.705
l do a lot of pro bono work
for youth groups.

08:24.914 --> 08:28.584
The car may have been involved in
some criminal activity prior to the theft,

08:28.751 --> 08:30.711
Ms. Oliver.

08:31.295 --> 08:33.255
We'll need to speak
to your client about this.

08:33.422 --> 08:35.090
First define ''criminal activity.''

08:35.256 --> 08:37.927
We're not prepared to disclose
that kind of information right now.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.346
Then l'm sorry, l can't help you.

08:40.929 --> 08:42.264
Why is that?

08:42.431 --> 08:43.599
Attorney-client privilege.

08:43.807 --> 08:45.684
lt prevents me
from divulging any information

08:45.851 --> 08:47.353
without my client's permission.

08:47.519 --> 08:49.271
l'm ethically bound
to protect their rights.

08:49.438 --> 08:51.440
Even if they may have
committed a crime?

08:51.607 --> 08:54.026
lf you believed that, you would have
come with a search warrant.

08:54.193 --> 08:55.945
Oh, we didn't think it was necessary.

08:56.111 --> 08:58.030
So l'll assume
you'll try and go get one now?

08:58.197 --> 08:59.657
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

08:59.823 --> 09:02.952
Great. Then l look forward
to seeing you again, Agent DiNozzo.

09:03.118 --> 09:05.287
- Tony.
- Tony.

09:09.291 --> 09:11.377
l hate lawyers.

09:19.468 --> 09:21.136
Have a seat.

09:24.390 --> 09:26.350
l'm not saying anything
till l get a lawyer.

09:26.559 --> 09:29.478
You're not here to talk,
Petty Officer Hobie.

09:29.645 --> 09:30.771
You're here to listen.

09:32.106 --> 09:33.607
They said you jacked the car

09:33.774 --> 09:36.235
and they know nothing
about what was in the trunk.

09:36.402 --> 09:38.153
Me?

09:38.696 --> 09:40.114
l believe them.

09:40.281 --> 09:42.825
That means you're screwed,
petty officer.

09:42.992 --> 09:46.245
Agent McGee?
Seven stolen cars in two weeks.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.664
- What's he looking at?
- First offence?

09:49.206 --> 09:52.001
Let's see, seven to ten for theft.

09:52.167 --> 09:55.004
Another four to five
for selling stolen property.

09:55.170 --> 09:56.964
So roughly, 1 2 years.

09:57.131 --> 09:59.842
Maybe out in six
with good behaviour.

10:00.009 --> 10:03.345
What about carrying around
a human head in an ice chest?

10:03.512 --> 10:05.139
Well, capital offence,

10:05.306 --> 10:07.808
with the gruesome nature
of the crime?

10:07.975 --> 10:12.354
l'm thinking... l'm thinking life,
and that's if he's lucky.

10:12.938 --> 10:15.024
- lf not...
- The death penalty.

10:15.566 --> 10:19.028
Whoa, hey.
l didn't know that was in there.

10:20.863 --> 10:23.657
When you boost a car, you don't check
to see what's in the trunk first.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.868
Where?

10:26.118 --> 10:27.203
lt was a parking lot.

10:29.538 --> 10:30.789
Chez Nude.

10:30.956 --> 10:32.875
lt's a strip club in Anacostia.

10:33.042 --> 10:34.501
l took it around midnight.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.836
Did you see the driver?

10:36.587 --> 10:38.047
No.

10:38.714 --> 10:40.466
All l saw was the chrome.

10:44.220 --> 10:46.222
Yes, but are you absolutely positive?

10:46.388 --> 10:47.598
Science doesn't lie, Ducky.

10:47.806 --> 10:51.727
No, but in my experience
it often can be misleading.

10:51.936 --> 10:53.062
- Abby.
- Gibbs. Okay,

10:53.229 --> 10:55.231
so we have two questions for you.
Where's my Caf-Pow?

10:55.397 --> 10:56.815
The machine was empty.

10:56.982 --> 10:59.068
- Second question?
- That wasn't one of the questions.

10:59.235 --> 11:00.986
- The machine's never empty.
- Abby.

11:01.153 --> 11:03.781
According to the Armed Forces
DNA Registry,

11:03.948 --> 11:08.702
the head in the autopsy room belongs
to Navy Captain Parker Wayne.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.579
You wanna know how he died
and why.

11:10.829 --> 11:12.957
We know how and why.

11:13.165 --> 11:15.334
He suffered
a fatal coronary infarction

11:15.501 --> 11:18.671
at Bethesda Naval Hospital
four months ago.

11:18.837 --> 11:22.967
So, what is his head
doing in the trunk of a stolen car?

11:23.133 --> 11:26.595
And where is the rest of his body?

11:34.520 --> 11:37.106
Can't connect Captain Wayne
to any of the three suspects, boss.

11:37.573 --> 11:39.408
No common service, ship or base.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.410
lf they had contact,
it wasn't through the Navy.

11:41.577 --> 11:43.078
You're asking me to believe a sailor

11:43.245 --> 11:45.873
jacked a car with a head in the trunk
and that he didn't know it?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.624
lf the glue sticks...

11:48.250 --> 11:49.835
<i>- ''Shoe fits.''
- Thank you.</i>

11:50.878 --> 11:52.254
DiNozzo.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.756
l'm with you, boss.

11:54.965 --> 11:58.135
Our carjacker definitely knows
more than he's telling us.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.762
We don't believe
in coincidences around here, Ziva.

12:00.971 --> 12:04.308
However, we do believe in bad luck.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.311
Did you get the search warrant?

12:07.477 --> 12:12.232
Faith Coleman says that we need
to petition for a preliminary injunction

12:12.399 --> 12:15.152
to compel Sean Oliver, Esquire,
to give up the name of her client.

12:15.319 --> 12:16.987
- So do it.
- Done it.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.656
Well, l mean, l did it.

12:19.865 --> 12:22.159
Since the captain died
of natural causes,

12:22.326 --> 12:24.661
it's gonna take the judge a while
to sign off on it.

12:24.828 --> 12:28.332
The lawyer drooled over Tony.
Why doesn't he just sleep with her?

12:31.084 --> 12:34.338
What?
lt's a viable interrogation technique.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.466
- l've done it.
- Me too.

12:37.841 --> 12:41.220
No trauma to the head.
No signs of cerebral haemorrrhage.

12:41.386 --> 12:44.848
The cause of death was definitely
coronary inclusion, Dr. Mallard.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.975
Caused by arteriosclerosis.

12:47.476 --> 12:50.103
l took this when l performed
the autopsy on Captain Wayne.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.649
Jethro. Special Agent Gibbs,
Commander Ross,

12:53.815 --> 12:57.319
the ME who performed the autopsy
on our captain four months ago.

12:57.486 --> 13:00.531
l must admit l've never been involved
in anything this strange.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.367
Remind me to show you
some of our cases sometime.

13:03.534 --> 13:04.785
Last year, we had a patient

13:04.952 --> 13:06.912
who spontaneously combusted,
or so we--

13:07.079 --> 13:09.206
You're certain heart attack
was the cause of death?

13:09.373 --> 13:11.375
Absolutely. Captain Wayne
was pronounced dead

13:11.542 --> 13:14.211
on the operating table
by one of our best heart surgeons.

13:14.378 --> 13:16.380
l performed the autopsy
two days later.

13:16.547 --> 13:19.883
When you last saw the captain,
his head was attached?

13:20.676 --> 13:21.718
Of course.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.057
What happened to his remains?

13:27.224 --> 13:29.726
At the request of the widow,
they were released to a mortuary.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.520
The...

13:31.895 --> 13:35.858
Let's see, Vernon Family Mortuary
in Annandale, Virginia.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.197
You'll have to excuse me,

13:42.364 --> 13:44.491
but l'm extremely short-handed
this afternoon, gentlemen.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.535
My furnace operator
didn't show up today.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.665
Mr. Vernon,
are those human remains?

13:53.709 --> 13:56.670
Were. Now they're just
carbon and ash, Agent McGee.

13:59.548 --> 14:00.632
Now, what can l do for you?

14:00.883 --> 14:02.968
We're investigating a death.

14:03.135 --> 14:05.095
l figured as much.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.889
How's that?

14:07.097 --> 14:08.515
The only time l see cops
around here

14:08.682 --> 14:11.101
is when they're on
an official investigation or when,

14:11.310 --> 14:14.021
you know, you're customers.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.859
The customer we're interested in
was here four months ago.

14:22.696 --> 14:23.739
Name?

14:23.906 --> 14:25.657
Captain Parker Wayne.

14:25.824 --> 14:30.245
Let's see: Wyatt, Winter and Wayne.

14:31.288 --> 14:34.708
From Bethesda.
He was cremated 1 22 days ago.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.919
- Wait, he was cremated?
- Yes.

14:37.085 --> 14:40.339
His wife asked for a Sea-rest urn
with interior gold-plated lining.

14:40.506 --> 14:42.382
Very high end.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.759
Sounds nice.

14:44.927 --> 14:48.430
Yeah, except for the fact
that there's a piece missing, Vernon.

14:48.597 --> 14:49.640
Oh, what do you mean?

14:50.140 --> 14:52.309
Well, a part of his body
has turned up.

14:52.559 --> 14:57.272
You mean like a body fragment,
or a bone fragment, or a tooth?

14:57.439 --> 14:59.066
Actually, more like his head.

15:00.234 --> 15:02.277
- A head?
- Found in a car trunk.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.488
We'd like to know how it got there.

15:08.492 --> 15:11.119
Remains picked up
at 7:45 a.m. on the 24th.

15:11.286 --> 15:13.664
He was cremated that evening,
Furnace 2.

15:13.831 --> 15:15.791
Attending technician, Martin.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.918
- Martin who?
- Broussard.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.795
- Where is he?
- He didn't show up for work,

15:19.962 --> 15:22.297
which is why l'm here
instead of out there where l'm needed.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.508
- We're gonna need his address.
- No need.

15:24.675 --> 15:26.301
l'll take you to his room.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.679
l can't believe l let him
live on the grounds.

15:28.846 --> 15:31.056
- For how long?
- Almost three years.

15:31.265 --> 15:34.685
This could ruin me. My family's
been in the business for 63 years.

15:34.852 --> 15:36.937
Anyone else licensed
to operate these ovens?

15:37.104 --> 15:41.108
Furnaces, Agent DiNozzo.
Just myself and Martin.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.611
Martin, if you're in there,
open up, damn it.

15:53.537 --> 15:54.872
Wait here.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.649
You thinking what l'm thinking,
probie?

16:22.816 --> 16:25.402
<i>Yeah, we just walked into
an episode of The X Files.</i>

16:33.494 --> 16:37.539
- Open that up, probie.
- No, you open it.

16:38.790 --> 16:42.294
- Who's the senior field agent?
- Gibbs.

16:42.503 --> 16:45.172
ln this room,
who is the senior field agent?

16:47.216 --> 16:48.759
Open it.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.012
Chucklehead.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.104
- What is it?
- lt's feet.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.397
l knew it.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.900
We're dealing
with another Dahmer here.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.278
The pig kind.

17:28.257 --> 17:31.552
Hi. What's your name?

17:37.641 --> 17:39.142
l'm Jethro.

17:41.854 --> 17:43.647
l'm here to talk to your mom.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.658
Did you know my daddy?

17:56.827 --> 18:00.455
No. No, l didn't. Not personally.

18:01.665 --> 18:03.834
He's dead, you know.

18:10.007 --> 18:11.216
l had them on the mantle,

18:11.383 --> 18:14.011
but Chrissy would stare at them
for hours.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.848
She couldn't understand
how her daddy could fit inside a jar.

18:18.098 --> 18:22.019
Her therapist said
it was probably unhealthy for her so...

18:22.186 --> 18:25.689
l understand that this must be tough
for you, Mrs. Wayne.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.984
Ashes are ashes, Agent Gibbs.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.444
Now what is this about?

18:31.695 --> 18:33.989
There may have been a mix-up.

18:34.573 --> 18:37.242
- These aren't my husband's ashes?
- No. No, they probably are.

18:37.409 --> 18:40.954
There just was a paper snafu
at Bethesda. We need to verify it.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.041
How can you do that?

18:45.042 --> 18:47.377
Teeth aren't totally destroyed
during cremation.

18:53.383 --> 18:57.012
l've been a Navy wife
for close to 20 years, Agent Gibbs.

18:57.179 --> 19:00.349
NClS agents
don't investigate mix-ups,

19:00.516 --> 19:04.061
at least not agents as old as you.

19:05.270 --> 19:09.483
Well, we have a new director,
ma'am.

19:09.650 --> 19:12.486
A female director.

19:13.487 --> 19:15.739
Let's just say l'm not

19:15.948 --> 19:18.909
as politically correct
as some of the younger agents.

19:21.954 --> 19:24.039
What did you do to piss her off?

19:24.206 --> 19:26.124
Well, see, if she was more like you

19:26.291 --> 19:28.585
then l wouldn't be sent out here
to do a probie's job.

19:29.294 --> 19:32.714
Not that this isn't important.
This is very important.

19:32.881 --> 19:35.926
l will handle the captain's remains
with the utmost respect, ma'am.

19:36.093 --> 19:37.511
That's a promise.

19:46.562 --> 19:49.064
- What did you do?
- She overheard a conversation

19:49.231 --> 19:51.775
- l had about her physical attri--
- Where are you taking my Dad?

19:52.276 --> 19:53.694
Oh, Chrissy. lt's okay.

19:53.902 --> 19:56.905
Agent Gibbs is a Marine. You know
how much Daddy liked them.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.200
Twenty years in the Navy,

20:00.367 --> 20:02.369
l know a Marine when l see one,
Agent Gibbs.

20:02.911 --> 20:05.414
As soon as this is verified,
it'll be returned.

20:06.957 --> 20:09.793
<i>Our last command was a cruiser,
the Manassas.</i>

20:09.960 --> 20:13.088
They deploy for eight months
next Thursday.

20:13.755 --> 20:18.093
Park's last wish was to have his ashes
scattered at sea by them.

20:18.594 --> 20:20.304
You'll have them back.

20:32.566 --> 20:33.650
l've hit a dead wall.

20:35.152 --> 20:37.487
Have any of you heard
of the nation of Nevis?

20:37.905 --> 20:39.740
No.

20:40.532 --> 20:43.160
- lt's in the Caribbean.
- l'm impressed.

20:43.368 --> 20:44.912
lf you're looking
for the most attractive

20:45.078 --> 20:50.000
and convenient offshore corporate
domicile, like my father, it's the place.

20:50.751 --> 20:52.461
That's where Epsilon's incorporated.

20:52.628 --> 20:54.046
lt's a haven of confidentiality.

20:54.213 --> 20:57.591
l mean, they won't disclose the names
of owners, officers, or directors.

20:57.925 --> 20:59.927
That's why the old man
seems to like it.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.428
lt sounds suspicious.

21:01.887 --> 21:03.597
l have a contact
who can get me that info.

21:03.764 --> 21:06.141
Ziva, don't talk about it. Do it.

21:06.308 --> 21:10.145
Well, it's a delicate situation, Gibbs.
Perhaps l should elaborate a--

21:16.860 --> 21:18.195
Martin Broussard.

21:18.362 --> 21:21.365
- Raised in New Orleans--
- Boss, barely graduated high school.

21:21.532 --> 21:24.034
- Dropped out of--
- Junior college after only one year.

21:24.201 --> 21:25.577
Record?

21:27.579 --> 21:30.082
- Two DUls and a--
- Shoplifting charge.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.000
We got prints from his room.
Abby is--

21:32.167 --> 21:34.378
Trying to match them
for the Mercedes from the chop shop.

21:34.545 --> 21:37.130
You think Broussard
could be Sean Oliver's client?

21:37.297 --> 21:40.884
No way. This guy's apartment makes
McGee's look like the Four Seasons.

21:41.093 --> 21:43.387
Whoa, what is wrong
with my home?

21:43.595 --> 21:47.224
There's nothing that a bulldozer
and a few coats of paint wouldn't fix.

21:47.391 --> 21:48.976
At least l wasn't afraid
to open a cooler.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.186
Okay, l wasn't afraid
to open a cool--

21:52.062 --> 21:53.981
l'm shutting up, boss.

22:01.905 --> 22:03.407
- Ziva.
- Director.

22:03.574 --> 22:05.659
- What can l do for you?
- A favour.

22:05.826 --> 22:09.204
- You wanna go back to lsrael?
- No, l actually love it here.

22:09.371 --> 22:12.207
- Gibbs is a great teacher.
- You'll learn.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.793
He's like the Hope Diamond:

22:14.960 --> 22:16.753
A valuable gem,

22:16.920 --> 22:18.839
but it comes with a curse.

22:19.006 --> 22:21.758
- Anyone l know in that car?
- You know what they say:

22:21.925 --> 22:24.219
''lf you have to ask...''

22:30.809 --> 22:33.604
Hey, they refilled the machine.

22:35.564 --> 22:36.982
What are you doing?

22:37.149 --> 22:40.819
lt's been a long day.
Yoga. Sirshasana.

22:40.986 --> 22:43.530
lt increases the blood flow
to the brain.

22:44.239 --> 22:46.742
l thought that's what this is for.

22:49.495 --> 22:50.871
That helps too.

22:51.038 --> 22:54.541
- l assume you're done.
- With the ashes? Yeah.

22:54.708 --> 22:57.044
Since cremation destroys all DNA,

22:57.211 --> 22:59.296
then genetic fingerprinting
of the cremains won't work.

22:59.463 --> 23:01.298
So l put them
through a particle accelerator

23:01.465 --> 23:03.800
- to try to ferret out any trace elements.
- And?

23:04.009 --> 23:06.803
And l found calcium,
which is present in human bones,

23:06.970 --> 23:08.430
- but no phosphorus.
- Which means?

23:08.597 --> 23:10.641
There's really no foreplay with you,
is there, Gibbs?

23:10.807 --> 23:13.477
What, you've been talking
to my ex-wives again?

23:13.685 --> 23:18.440
The urn contained burnt wood chips,
concrete, dust and pebbles.

23:18.607 --> 23:20.108
The ashes are bogus.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.620
Ask yourself what kind of guy

23:32.787 --> 23:36.290
lives in a coffin storage shed
at a funeral home.

23:36.833 --> 23:39.335
- Perhaps a poor one?
- l'd buy that except for the fact

23:39.502 --> 23:43.172
<i>that it looks like this guy did an episode
of Trading Spaces with Satan.</i>

23:43.548 --> 23:45.132
What we need to figure out
is why this guy

23:45.299 --> 23:46.634
decided to keep the man's head.

23:46.843 --> 23:49.595
And how it ended up in the trunk
of a stolen Mercedes.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.848
Maybe he needed it
for some sort of ritual.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.350
- Or sacrifice.
- Witchcraft?

23:54.517 --> 23:56.018
Whatever you wanna call it, probie.

23:56.561 --> 24:01.232
l agree. Anyone so obviously
fascinated with death

24:01.399 --> 24:03.109
has to be deeply disturbed
on some level.

24:03.276 --> 24:05.361
l mean, take these masks,
for instance.

24:05.528 --> 24:08.823
What kind of a person would collect
such horrid-looking things?

24:08.990 --> 24:10.324
- Me.
- Of course, by ''horrid,''

24:10.491 --> 24:15.329
l mean, finely crafted and artistic.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.375
- Good morning, Abby.
- Hi.

24:20.877 --> 24:22.086
The masks are Ogum.

24:22.253 --> 24:24.922
They're used in tribal ceremonies
in Africa. Friend of mine makes them.

24:25.089 --> 24:27.633
<i>- l see. And this?
- Drapeau or flag.</i>

24:27.800 --> 24:31.971
lt symbolizes the bridge between
your spiritual and your earthly planes.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.932
l'm not an expert,
but l would say that

24:35.141 --> 24:37.435
Martin Broussard
is in to voodoo, bigtime.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.938
- So it is witchcraft.
- No, McGee, it's voodoo.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.190
What's the difference?

24:42.356 --> 24:44.442
<i>Haven't you ever seen Voodoo lsland
with Boris Karloff?</i>

24:44.609 --> 24:46.444
<i>The Believers, Martin Sheen?</i>

24:46.611 --> 24:48.237
<i>The Serpent and the Rainbow?</i>

24:48.404 --> 24:49.697
<i>Sleepless in Seattle?</i>

24:50.323 --> 24:51.616
That was about voodoo?

24:51.782 --> 24:54.869
No, but the first time l saw it,
it scared the bejesus out of me.

24:55.036 --> 24:56.621
- ls that a fact, DiNozzo?
- Yes, sir.

24:56.787 --> 24:58.873
We think we just had
a major breakthrough in the case.

24:59.040 --> 25:02.043
- You found Broussard?
- No, not exactly.

25:02.210 --> 25:04.086
You got the warrant
to search the law offices?

25:04.253 --> 25:05.546
Not yet.

25:05.713 --> 25:08.341
Your contacts found out
who owns Epsilon Corporation?

25:08.508 --> 25:10.092
They haven't gotten back to me yet.

25:10.259 --> 25:14.222
ln retrospect, ''major'' may have
been overstating things, sir. l'm sorry.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.098
What, Abby?
You have to go to the bathroom,

25:16.265 --> 25:19.477
- or you have something to say?
- l do. But that's not the point.

25:19.644 --> 25:23.105
Ducky and l might have found
something that's ''minjor.''

25:23.272 --> 25:27.777
lt's maybe not major,
but it's more than minor.

25:27.944 --> 25:30.613
Duck, are you saying Captain Wayne
was used in some kind of sacrifice?

25:30.780 --> 25:33.282
l'm just saying
it's a possibility, Jethro.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.451
We found traces of blood
on three of the knives

25:35.618 --> 25:36.994
we got from
Martin Broussard's room.

25:37.161 --> 25:40.081
- All three came back the same type.
- Captain Wayne's?

25:40.289 --> 25:42.375
- Nope, chicken.
- Chicken.

25:42.542 --> 25:46.796
Well, it's not an uncommon substance
to find at a voodoo ritual.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.757
Yeah, or at a KFC. What else?

25:49.924 --> 25:50.967
Patience, Gibbs.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.719
l ran the fingerprints
from the Mercedes,

25:53.886 --> 25:56.722
the cooler in the back of the car,
and Martin Broussard's room.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.724
They're all the same
and they're all his.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.184
Broussard stole the Mercedes?

26:00.351 --> 26:03.604
Either that or he just
really likes to touch stuff.

26:05.523 --> 26:07.400
Okay, l'll let Gibbs know. Thank you.

26:07.650 --> 26:09.527
Let Gibbs know what,
Agent McGee?

26:11.028 --> 26:14.490
That Captain Wayne's widow
is on her way up, director.

26:14.657 --> 26:18.369
- How much does she know?
- l'm not sure, ma'am.

26:18.536 --> 26:19.954
Gibbs returned with the cremains,

26:20.121 --> 26:21.873
but l don't know what he said
to get them.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.124
Let's hope he didn't say

26:23.291 --> 26:25.668
that we found
her husband's head in a trunk.

26:26.419 --> 26:29.213
Well, l don't think that-- Would he?

26:29.463 --> 26:32.008
Have you gotten the warrant
for Sean Oliver's law office?

26:32.216 --> 26:34.552
Still working on it, ma'am.
l've put several calls in

26:34.719 --> 26:37.388
to the Assistant
U.S. Attorney's office,

26:37.555 --> 26:39.140
but they're dragging their feet.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.392
l expected they would,
so l made a personal call

26:41.559 --> 26:43.227
to the Attorney General's office.

26:43.728 --> 26:45.438
Here's your warrant.

26:46.939 --> 26:50.359
You can close your mouth,
Agent McGee. lt's not that impressive.

26:54.405 --> 26:56.115
Get Gibbs.

26:56.908 --> 26:58.409
l'll escort Mrs. Wayne from here.

26:58.576 --> 26:59.911
Yes, ma'am.

27:00.203 --> 27:01.913
Special Agent Gibbs is on his way.
l'm--

27:02.079 --> 27:03.915
Did he make
a positive identification?

27:04.081 --> 27:06.417
A positive identification?

27:06.584 --> 27:08.085
Of your husband's cremains?

27:08.252 --> 27:10.087
l want the remains verified
for every body

27:10.254 --> 27:12.173
Broussard was supposed to burn.

27:12.340 --> 27:13.382
Not a problem, boss.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.718
- What do we tell the families?
- Depends on what we find.

27:15.885 --> 27:18.387
- You think he's done this before?
- The guy's cutting up chickens

27:18.554 --> 27:20.139
and carrying heads around
in coolers, Ziva.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.225
l don't know.
What's your gut tell you?

27:22.391 --> 27:24.769
That l never want to be cremated.

27:25.853 --> 27:28.397
Sorry, boss. One, got the warrant.

27:28.564 --> 27:29.857
Good job. Tony, you're with me.

27:30.024 --> 27:33.236
Sir, Mrs. Wayne is here
and Director Shepard is with her.

27:36.113 --> 27:39.784
He said the paper mix-up could be
resolved with my husband's teeth.

27:40.451 --> 27:43.246
lf Special Agent Gibbs told you that,
l'm sure it's the truth.

27:43.412 --> 27:46.123
He's one of the most knowledgeable
agents l've ever worked with.

27:46.290 --> 27:50.545
l had that impression. l'm glad he was
assigned this, even if it is punishment.

27:54.507 --> 27:57.635
- Punishment?
- The new director has it in for him.

27:57.802 --> 27:58.845
He told you that?

27:59.011 --> 28:01.305
Well, l've seen it before.
When Parker was XO

28:01.472 --> 28:03.724
for one of the first female
ship captains:

28:04.141 --> 28:07.478
The woman was a nightmare
trying to prove herself.

28:07.645 --> 28:11.732
Special Agent Gibbs, l didn't know
the new director was punishing you.

28:12.483 --> 28:15.736
She always seemed very fair to me.

28:15.903 --> 28:19.073
Well, you're a woman. She doesn't
have anything to prove to you.

28:20.867 --> 28:23.744
How about you? What do you think?

28:23.911 --> 28:27.290
Do you think the new director
is reasonable?

28:27.456 --> 28:29.834
- Very.
- Why are you here, Mrs. Wayne?

28:30.001 --> 28:31.460
Have you made
a positive identification?

28:31.627 --> 28:32.753
The lab's working on it.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.922
- l'm sorry to be troubling you.
- No trouble at all.

28:35.089 --> 28:37.550
<i>The Manassas has been put
on alert to sail early.</i>

28:37.717 --> 28:39.051
- How early?
- Tuesday.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.512
l have to have Parker's ashes there
by Monday night.

28:41.679 --> 28:44.765
l don't wanna wait another year
to honour my husband's last wish.

28:44.932 --> 28:46.184
l'll do my best.

28:46.350 --> 28:49.187
You'll have your husband's ashes
by Monday.

28:49.353 --> 28:50.938
Won't she, Agent Gibbs?

28:53.232 --> 28:54.400
lf you say so.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.909
She isn't the new--

29:05.244 --> 29:07.705
Hi. Nice to see you again. NClS.
We have a search warrant.

29:07.914 --> 29:12.168
Go right on in.
Ms. Oliver has been expecting you.

29:17.924 --> 29:18.966
That was fast.

29:19.133 --> 29:20.718
lt gives us the right to search
the premises

29:20.885 --> 29:23.638
for every and all documents
pertaining to Epsilon Corporation.

29:23.804 --> 29:26.390
l think you'll find everything
you need in those boxes.

29:30.645 --> 29:35.233
Your director's not the only one with
friends in the U.S. Attorney's office.

29:35.942 --> 29:38.319
You have the papers,
so l can't stop you,

29:38.486 --> 29:41.155
but l do think this is overkill
for a stolen car.

29:41.322 --> 29:44.033
We're more interested in
who was driving it before it was stolen.

29:44.659 --> 29:46.619
- Why?
- l'll make you a deal.

29:46.786 --> 29:50.122
You tell me
who runs Epsilon Corporation,

29:50.498 --> 29:51.833
l tell you why.

29:52.208 --> 29:56.546
Unfortunately, l can't make deals
without consulting my clients.

29:56.754 --> 29:58.256
You should make the call, Sean.

29:58.923 --> 30:02.593
At least give me a clue as to what it is
we're dealing with here, Tony.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.556
Was it drugs?

30:06.722 --> 30:09.433
More along the lines
of human sacrifice.

30:10.643 --> 30:13.145
She's had 24 hours
to cleanse these files.

30:13.312 --> 30:16.691
- What are we hoping to find?
- Names of employees and addresses.

30:16.941 --> 30:18.776
We might get through this
by the end of the month

30:18.943 --> 30:20.152
if you actually helped us, Tony.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.946
l'm supervising.

30:22.113 --> 30:23.197
Hi, Gibbs.

30:25.408 --> 30:27.118
- Nice one.
- Yeah, it is.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.329
- Boss, l was just about to call you.
- What a coincidence.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.331
l was just about to put my boot
up your--

30:32.498 --> 30:33.541
Got a lead.

30:33.708 --> 30:35.960
Found an electric bill
in one of the boxes.

30:36.127 --> 30:39.046
An industrial space in Anacostia,
three miles from the strip club

30:39.213 --> 30:44.343
- where the Mercedes was stolen.
- Ziva, McGee, go check it out.

30:46.053 --> 30:49.348
Tony? Go on, supervise.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.646
lt doesn't look like anybody's here.

31:10.620 --> 31:11.913
All right, what do we do?

31:12.079 --> 31:14.582
- Well, at least we have a warrant.
- Right.

31:14.749 --> 31:16.083
No. Not really.

31:17.210 --> 31:18.669
What is your problem, probie?

31:18.836 --> 31:21.672
Well, the warrant only covers
Epsilon's files.

31:23.633 --> 31:27.011
- Can you see inside that window?
- You know that l can't.

31:27.178 --> 31:30.431
So for all you know,
there could be files in there, yes?

31:30.598 --> 31:33.518
Technically, yes. But we could be
obfuscating the warrant.

31:34.101 --> 31:35.645
- You know what that means?
- Not at all.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.480
Good. Neither do l. Pick the lock.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.273
''Obfuscating.''

31:39.440 --> 31:42.568
What sort of knucklehead
uses a word like ''obfuscating''?

31:43.694 --> 31:44.904
Picklehead.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.656
Nice work, Ziva.

31:46.823 --> 31:50.451
- Tony?
- Two to one. You lose, probie.

31:53.204 --> 31:55.540
- A bad idea.
- What?

32:07.510 --> 32:09.929
Wonder what they do in here?

32:12.348 --> 32:15.393
- We should not have broken in here.
- What?

32:15.560 --> 32:18.354
- We shouldn't have broken in here.
- lf you wanna be a crybaby,

32:18.521 --> 32:20.439
why don't you wait outside
for the police?

32:20.606 --> 32:22.608
What are we gonna tell them?

32:33.911 --> 32:36.247
Might be easier to show them.

32:52.430 --> 32:54.348
You know what this place
reminds me of?

32:54.515 --> 32:56.851
One of your stupid voodoo movies?

32:57.018 --> 32:58.436
No.

32:58.603 --> 33:02.481
My Uncle Vincenzo's shop
on Long lsland. He's a butcher.

33:04.442 --> 33:06.986
Yet another reason why
l'm considering becoming a vegetarian.

33:07.153 --> 33:09.447
We may need a couple extra gurneys
on this one, Palmer.

33:11.741 --> 33:14.827
- How many are we looking at, Duck?
- Based upon size,

33:14.994 --> 33:20.374
skin tone, and gender difference,
there are at least

33:20.583 --> 33:25.254
partial remains
of six cadavers in here.

33:25.421 --> 33:26.631
This isn't voodoo.

33:26.797 --> 33:31.344
l agree. Based upon the surgical skill
with which they were dissected,

33:32.053 --> 33:34.847
you've found yourself
another chop shop, Jethro.

33:35.014 --> 33:37.225
Only instead of automobiles
being harvested--

33:37.391 --> 33:38.559
Body parts?

33:38.726 --> 33:40.561
Any of these parts
belong to Captain Wayne, Duck?

33:40.728 --> 33:43.439
Oh, Jethro, please.

33:44.106 --> 33:46.609
- So how grisly was it?
- Not bad.

33:46.776 --> 33:49.320
Shelves lined with body parts
is not bad?

33:49.487 --> 33:51.155
At least they were
surgically removed.

33:51.322 --> 33:52.365
Yeah.

33:52.532 --> 33:54.075
Were the bodies
supposed to be cremated?

33:54.242 --> 33:55.368
l don't know.

33:55.535 --> 33:58.120
McGee's getting the mortuary records
for the last few months.

33:58.287 --> 34:01.040
l do not know why anyone
would wanna be cremated.

34:01.541 --> 34:03.543
Do you really wanna
be stuck in the ground?

34:03.709 --> 34:05.503
- She already has a coffin.
- Oh, no.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.047
l just wanna know
that the rest of my body parts,

34:08.214 --> 34:10.382
after l donate whatever l can
to science,

34:10.591 --> 34:13.344
are gonna rot for eternity
in a familiar place.

34:13.511 --> 34:18.266
- How about you, Tony?
- The slow rot or the fast burn?

34:18.431 --> 34:20.726
Neither, please,
thank you very much.

34:20.893 --> 34:21.978
What's your alternative?

34:22.143 --> 34:25.356
Ted Williams. Cryogenics.

34:25.523 --> 34:27.984
Appropriate under the circumstances,
Agent DiNozzo.

34:28.150 --> 34:31.279
The only thing Ted Williams
had frozen was his head.

34:32.362 --> 34:34.114
Here's the information
you were looking for.

34:34.282 --> 34:37.577
The principal and sole shareholder
of Epsilon Corporation.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.288
Sean Oliver!

34:40.913 --> 34:42.790
Now l really do hate lawyers.

34:44.292 --> 34:47.587
- Thank you, director.
- Glad l could be of help.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.672
ls something wrong?

34:51.465 --> 34:56.179
Oh, l was just wondering if Gibbs
knows who Ziva's secret contact is.

34:56.846 --> 35:01.309
We had a saying in Europe:
''Whatever Gibbs doesn't know--''

35:01.475 --> 35:05.563
- Can't hurt him.
- No. ''Can't hurt us.''

35:07.148 --> 35:11.736
lt would appear they were all dissected
by the same individual, Jethro.

35:12.320 --> 35:17.033
lt's the direction
that the incisions were made. Look.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.203
Straight cuts
are normally canted to the right

35:20.369 --> 35:23.080
due to the position of the scalpel
in the right hand.

35:23.581 --> 35:26.417
All of these were canted
in the opposite direction.

35:26.584 --> 35:27.627
We're looking for someone

35:27.793 --> 35:29.045
- that's left-handed.
- Precisely.

35:29.212 --> 35:31.672
Any idea which ones
are Captain Wayne's?

35:31.839 --> 35:34.425
We're taking tissue samples
of the individual parts

35:34.592 --> 35:36.385
and prints from the hands.

35:36.552 --> 35:39.972
And we'll try to assemble
Captain Wayne where we can.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.891
l've got less than two days, Duck.

35:42.058 --> 35:44.727
We told his wife
we'd return his ashes by Monday.

35:44.894 --> 35:47.563
- l could bring in another ME to help.
- Yeah, yeah. Do it.

35:47.730 --> 35:48.940
My contact came through, Gibbs.

35:49.106 --> 35:50.733
The client Sean Oliver was
protecting was--

35:50.900 --> 35:52.902
- Sean Oliver.
- Tony and McGee are picking her up.

35:53.069 --> 35:56.030
- Not bad, Officer David.
- Well, l do what l can.

35:56.197 --> 35:58.866
When you see the director,
thank her for me.

36:00.743 --> 36:04.121
There's a reason you couldn't find her
anywhere last night, Jethro.

36:04.288 --> 36:07.166
She was meeting
with the District Attorney's office

36:07.917 --> 36:09.919
cutting a deal.

36:10.086 --> 36:13.089
- What kind of deal?
- More than she deserves.

36:13.256 --> 36:14.757
Do you think it would
be inappropriate,

36:14.924 --> 36:18.177
if, as director, l went in there
and smacked that smile off her face?

36:20.596 --> 36:24.308
Yeah, it would.
But that's what you have me for.

36:30.773 --> 36:32.900
Thank you very much, ma'am.

36:33.568 --> 36:36.779
That was one of Martin Broussard's
elementary school teachers.

36:36.946 --> 36:39.365
What could she possibly tell you
that's relevant to this case?

36:39.532 --> 36:42.076
A lot, Ziva. Slow learner.

36:42.243 --> 36:46.205
Troublemaker.
Not real big on oral hygiene.

36:46.372 --> 36:49.292
That's fascinating, Tony.
And this helps us find him how?

36:49.458 --> 36:51.752
lt doesn't. But at least now we know
he was left-handed.

36:55.756 --> 36:56.966
Officer David.

36:57.133 --> 36:59.302
<i>- Got something for you guys.
- On our way.</i>

37:01.596 --> 37:03.556
Abby found something.

37:06.642 --> 37:09.353
His name
was Captain Parker Wayne.

37:10.605 --> 37:12.648
He was married.

37:12.815 --> 37:14.025
Had a 9-year-old daughter

37:14.192 --> 37:16.903
who just worshipped
the ground he walked on.

37:17.862 --> 37:20.364
My client admitted
her involvement in the sale

37:20.531 --> 37:24.243
of illegal body parts already,
Agent Gibbs.

37:24.535 --> 37:28.206
His last request was to have
his ashes scattered at sea.

37:28.664 --> 37:32.502
What would you like me
to tell this little girl, Ms. Oliver?

37:32.668 --> 37:34.170
That that can't happen
because you wanna

37:34.337 --> 37:36.172
join a more expensive
country club?

37:36.339 --> 37:39.467
- This was never about money.
- Sean, he's baiting you.

37:39.634 --> 37:41.385
Let him, Simon.

37:42.303 --> 37:45.056
The deceased were to be cremated.

37:45.223 --> 37:47.350
By supplying their bodies
for medical research,

37:47.517 --> 37:49.852
advances were made
to benefit the living.

37:50.019 --> 37:52.230
Any profits you made
were just incidental, right?

37:52.396 --> 37:56.067
Part of my client's plea agreement
is to make financial restitution.

37:56.234 --> 37:59.070
Your client was carving up
dead people

37:59.237 --> 38:01.447
and selling parts like meat.

38:01.614 --> 38:03.115
Where's Martin Broussard?

38:05.034 --> 38:07.119
Not part of our arrangement.

38:07.286 --> 38:09.872
l've got the parts
to six different bodies downstairs.

38:10.039 --> 38:13.501
She is not going anywhere
until l l.D. them.

38:15.837 --> 38:17.964
- Where's Gibbs?
- lnterrogation. Why?

38:24.303 --> 38:25.471
l found him.

38:25.638 --> 38:27.723
- ''We.'' We found him.
- Found who, Abby?

38:29.475 --> 38:31.394
Martin Broussard.

38:38.651 --> 38:41.070
We located Martin Broussard.

38:41.696 --> 38:44.448
Then you have no further need
to question my client.

38:44.615 --> 38:46.951
We have him downstairs in autopsy.

38:47.118 --> 38:48.327
- To identify the bodies?
- Nope.

38:48.494 --> 38:50.872
- Sean. They can do whatever--
- He's one of them.

38:51.038 --> 38:52.123
Martin is dead?

38:53.332 --> 38:56.002
l don't know anything about it.
Simon?

38:56.169 --> 38:59.213
We found his body parts
in your building.

38:59.797 --> 39:03.301
The only thing we can't locate,
it seems, is his head.

39:05.428 --> 39:07.221
l think your deal with the DA
just went south.

39:07.388 --> 39:08.806
l didn't kill him.

39:08.973 --> 39:10.308
lf you didn't, you know who did.

39:10.474 --> 39:13.936
As your lawyer, l advise you not
to answer any more questions, Sean.

39:14.103 --> 39:16.689
A man was murdered here, Simon.

39:18.357 --> 39:19.942
Vernon supplied the bodies.

39:20.359 --> 39:23.488
Martin was--
Was just a delivery man.

39:23.654 --> 39:26.782
They must've thought he was too weak
to stand up to an investigation.

39:27.909 --> 39:29.494
They?

39:31.579 --> 39:34.999
l appreciate your volunteering
to help, Dr. Ross.

39:35.166 --> 39:38.419
Anything to get out of Bethesda
for a couple of days, Dr. Mallard.

39:38.586 --> 39:40.338
Where do you want this one,
doctor?

39:40.922 --> 39:43.090
ls that what this is all about,
the body parts?

39:43.299 --> 39:45.593
lt would appear that way.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.470
lt's understandable. That arm alone

39:47.637 --> 39:49.764
- would be worth a fortune.
- Really?

39:49.931 --> 39:52.350
Pharmaceutical
and medical-instrument firms

39:52.517 --> 39:54.810
would pay vast sums for cadavers.

39:54.977 --> 39:58.731
- Where do they get them?
- Willed-body programmes, universities.

39:58.898 --> 40:01.317
But the need far outstrips the supply.

40:01.484 --> 40:03.861
A human body can be worth
as much as $200,000.

40:04.654 --> 40:07.824
Well, how much do you suppose
just a little arm would be?

40:08.282 --> 40:11.410
A lot. lt's not unlike car theft.

40:11.953 --> 40:17.583
A vehicle stripped and sold for parts
is worth far more than when it's whole.

40:17.750 --> 40:19.961
And harder to trace.

40:20.670 --> 40:22.547
Table 2.

40:23.005 --> 40:25.967
Wow, this could pay off
my college loans.

40:26.384 --> 40:29.971
Don't give me cause to check
your car trunk tonight, Mr. Palmer.

40:31.556 --> 40:36.185
We haven't yet determined
the cause of death of this poor man.

40:36.394 --> 40:40.064
Would you care to open?

40:40.857 --> 40:42.692
My pleasure, doctor.

40:54.203 --> 40:56.372
l suppose you'll tell me
you didn't do it for money.

40:56.789 --> 40:57.999
Excuse me?

40:58.166 --> 41:00.209
Dissecting these bodies.

41:02.545 --> 41:04.005
What--?

41:05.464 --> 41:06.841
What would ever
make you think that?

41:08.384 --> 41:11.637
By the way you used this.

41:13.222 --> 41:15.600
- They know, Ross.
- What?

41:18.060 --> 41:22.023
l admit the money was good, but--

41:22.607 --> 41:25.818
- My intent was to help people.
- ls that so?

41:25.985 --> 41:29.864
Yes. l don't care
whether you believe me or not.

41:30.031 --> 41:31.407
As long as you do, doctor.

41:32.408 --> 41:35.161
Before you buy this,
he murdered Broussard.

41:35.328 --> 41:37.914
- No. No, l didn't.
- The hell you didn't.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.832
- She presented his body to me--
- He's lying!

41:39.999 --> 41:42.376
l don't give a damn
which one of you did it.

41:42.793 --> 41:44.295
Well, l do.

41:46.005 --> 41:47.340
Tony, get them out of here.

41:47.507 --> 41:49.383
Scum ambulance chaser.

41:49.550 --> 41:51.636
- Stop lying.
- lf you think for one minute l'll take--

41:51.802 --> 41:54.263
- Would you for once tell the truth?
- lt was all your idea.

41:54.430 --> 41:58.226
Mr. Palmer, would you leave us alone
in a minute, please?

41:58.684 --> 42:01.729
Jethro, you do realise
that Captain Wayne's remains

42:01.896 --> 42:04.982
are considered evidence
in this case.

42:05.566 --> 42:07.652
Well, you can't possibly
be considering cremating them

42:07.819 --> 42:09.737
in time to give them to his widow.

42:11.989 --> 42:13.533
Right.

42:14.283 --> 42:16.869
l'll go with you to the crematorium.

42:22.708 --> 42:24.877
Chrissy was really starting to worry,

42:25.086 --> 42:27.797
but l told her that Marines
always keep their word.

42:28.422 --> 42:30.842
Sweetie, go get changed.
We have to leave for the ship soon.

42:31.008 --> 42:32.051
Okay, Mommy.

42:32.218 --> 42:34.136
And put the dress on that Daddy
brought from France.

42:34.303 --> 42:36.097
He loved you in it.

42:46.566 --> 42:48.317
Are those my husband's ashes?

42:48.484 --> 42:50.111
Yes, ma'am.

42:52.071 --> 42:53.906
l give you my word.

42:56.075 --> 42:59.370
lt would be my pleasure to escort you
and your daughter to the ship.

43:00.788 --> 43:03.541
The Navy's sending a car,
but thanks.

43:11.257 --> 43:12.842
Thank you, Agent Gibbs.

43:16.721 --> 43:23.060
<i>And Parker would never forgive me
if l didn't say ''semper fi. ''</i>

43:34.155 --> 43:36.199
Fair winds and following seas,
ma'am.
