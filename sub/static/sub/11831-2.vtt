36:16.684 --> 36:19.821
Yes. Peter--

36:19.887 --> 36:21.788
He said that since
Marty was gay,

36:21.856 --> 36:25.992
the police would probably
fob it off to the vice squad,
where it would collect dust.

36:26.059 --> 36:29.129
He said the file
would probably decompose
before Marty did.

36:29.195 --> 36:32.966
Do you have an opinion
as to whether Mr. Andleman
took these threats seriously?

36:33.033 --> 36:34.901
I know we both did.

36:34.968 --> 36:37.603
[ Jean ]
When was the last of these
threats made, Mr. Heric?

36:37.670 --> 36:40.340
The day of Peter's death.
[ Jean ]
Could you describe...

36:40.406 --> 36:43.375
the events of that day
which led up to the time
that you discovered Mr. Fineman?

36:43.443 --> 36:46.011
<i>[ Sighs ]</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

36:46.078 --> 36:48.347
Marty had just been
threatened again,

36:48.413 --> 36:52.051
and he was reacting
in an out-of-control manner.

36:52.117 --> 36:54.219
[ Jean ]
Out of control.
How so?

36:54.286 --> 36:57.689
He said he'd kill Peter.
I mean, he was just
<i>saying</i> it in my mind,

36:57.756 --> 36:59.891
or so I thought.

36:59.958 --> 37:02.126
Then he and I
got into it.

37:02.193 --> 37:07.030
- You two got into it?
- <i>Marty was blasting me for</i>
letting it get to this point.

37:07.097 --> 37:09.567
We shouted.

37:09.633 --> 37:13.036
All of a sudden,
I'm accusing him of not having
the courage to kill Peter.

37:13.103 --> 37:18.041
You said that to him?
<i>Yes, I-- I suppose,</i>
<i>in a way, I--</i>

37:18.108 --> 37:20.910
I challenged him
to do it.

37:20.977 --> 37:23.079
<i>Then I tossed him the keys</i>
<i>to the apartment...</i>

37:23.145 --> 37:26.282
and said,
"Go ahead. Do it."

37:26.348 --> 37:28.117
And then what happened?

37:28.184 --> 37:30.286
He left.

37:30.352 --> 37:33.189
I still--
I still didn't think
he would do it.

37:35.324 --> 37:37.325
<i>About an hour passed,</i>
<i>and he hadn't come back.</i>

37:37.393 --> 37:39.928
I decided
to drive over there.

37:39.995 --> 37:44.099
And when you drove over
to Peter Fineman's apartment,
what did you find?

37:44.165 --> 37:46.034
Peter.

37:46.101 --> 37:49.470
- Dead?
- Not yet.

37:49.537 --> 37:52.306
<i>He was still alive</i>
<i>when I got there.</i>

37:52.372 --> 37:55.542
It hadn't happened <i>yet.</i>

37:58.178 --> 38:00.180
Well, then,
what happened next?

38:00.247 --> 38:03.683
Peter and I got
into a huge argument.

38:03.750 --> 38:06.085
I-- I lost my temper.

38:06.152 --> 38:08.054
[ Sighs ]

38:08.121 --> 38:09.989
And I picked up the knife
and stabbed him.

38:10.056 --> 38:13.559
[ Spectators Murmuring ]

38:13.626 --> 38:16.295
- <i>You</i> stabbed him?
- Right in the heart.

38:16.362 --> 38:19.632
<i>He went down</i>
<i>like a sack of bricks.</i>

38:19.698 --> 38:22.234
- <i>[ Judge ]</i>
<i>What is going on here?</i>
- <i>[ Man ] Pardon me.</i>

38:22.300 --> 38:26.671
<i>Mr. Heric, yesterday</i>
<i>you told me that</i>
<i>Mr. Andleman did it.</i>

38:26.738 --> 38:29.141
I did not, counsel.
I said he had
<i>threatened</i> to do it.

38:29.207 --> 38:31.776
Remember, I specifically
said that <i>I</i> was
responsible for the death.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.178
You never came out
and said that you had done it.

38:34.245 --> 38:38.482
Of course not.
I didn't have immunity then.

38:41.918 --> 38:44.154
Now I do.

38:46.557 --> 38:48.959
I never said he did it.
I continually maintained...

38:49.025 --> 38:51.962
<i>how inconceivable it was</i>
<i>that he could have done it.</i>

38:52.028 --> 38:55.031
Don't get cute, Mr. Heric.
The entire spirit
of this agreement...

38:55.098 --> 38:57.967
was for you
to deliver Marty Andleman
and you damn well know it.

38:58.033 --> 39:01.303
I testified to absolutely
everything on that paper.
I was word perfect.

39:01.370 --> 39:03.638
- Could I
see that, Judge?
- No.

39:04.874 --> 39:08.310
Did you know
about this?
Of course not.

39:08.377 --> 39:12.280
I was as duped as you.
I'm sorry, Jean.

39:12.347 --> 39:15.183
<i>So, um, ah--</i>
<i>Wait a second.</i>

39:15.249 --> 39:19.253
- When Marty left to go
to the victim's apartment--
- He never went there.

39:19.320 --> 39:22.323
He went
to the public gardens
and fed the ducks.

39:22.390 --> 39:26.494
<i>Can you believe it? Says</i>
<i>he's going to kill somebody</i>
<i>and he feeds ducks.</i>

39:26.560 --> 39:28.962
I told you he didn't
have it in him.
Nobody listens, Judge.

39:29.029 --> 39:31.498
The immunity agreement
should be voided
on the grounds of fraud.

39:31.564 --> 39:33.867
Well, he did testify
in accordance
with its terms.

39:33.934 --> 39:36.569
The threats, the keys--
Your Honor,
this entire thing--

39:36.636 --> 39:39.171
Did-- Did you ever ask him
if he did it?

39:39.238 --> 39:41.541
Well, I didn't think
that it was necess--

39:41.608 --> 39:45.411
Everything here is the truth.
Everything he said on the stand
may be the truth.

39:45.477 --> 39:47.679
Did you ever
ask him flat out
if he was the killer?

39:49.448 --> 39:53.184
No. But this entire thing
was premised on the f--

39:53.251 --> 39:55.454
on that Marty was the killer.

39:55.521 --> 39:58.757
Well, he is guilty of murder.
And you are guilty...

39:58.824 --> 40:02.460
of a god-awful, sloppy
immunity agreement.

40:02.527 --> 40:04.395
But the bottom line is,
it's enforceable.

40:04.462 --> 40:06.964
<i>He is a free man.</i>

40:07.031 --> 40:10.935
And you wonder how
I can strut around
feeling smarter.

40:11.001 --> 40:14.438
Your Honor, I want to conduct
a hearing to establish
the validity of that contract.

40:14.504 --> 40:17.607
The contract says what the
contract says. Unfortunately,
I signed off on it.

40:19.343 --> 40:23.246
- Now I would like to know what
part you two played in this.
- None.

40:23.312 --> 40:25.248
He spun us
from the beginning.

40:25.314 --> 40:27.650
You bet I did.
And it was delicious.

40:27.716 --> 40:30.286
I mean, I had him
<i>shoving</i> that agreement
down my esophagus.

40:30.353 --> 40:33.722
- You should have seen it.
- We can still file
federal claims.

40:33.789 --> 40:36.391
Oh, come on, skinny.

40:36.459 --> 40:38.393
You don't think
I checked that out?

40:38.460 --> 40:40.562
Your only appeal
is on the talk shows.

40:40.628 --> 40:43.598
Ooh--
Go sell a book.

<i>[ Door Closes ]</i>

40:48.403 --> 40:51.372
[ Rebecca ]
Mmm. Okay.

40:54.008 --> 40:56.843
What happened?
Well, everything worked out
for Joey too.

an hour ago, but I was afraid
I'd get weepy.

The way you three
stuck up for me,

41:14.694 --> 41:17.630
I'm never gonna forget that.

41:17.697 --> 41:21.000
I remember sittin' with my dad
when I was little,

41:21.066 --> 41:23.135
when this limo drove by.

41:23.202 --> 41:26.971
I-I said, "I want to grow up
to be rich someday too."

41:27.038 --> 41:31.543
He said, "You can't tell
from limos if a guy's rich.

41:31.610 --> 41:35.079
You gotta measure his friends."

41:35.146 --> 41:38.149
Well, working with you guys,

41:38.216 --> 41:41.319
being able to count you
as my friends,

41:41.385 --> 41:44.522
I feel pretty--

41:46.757 --> 41:50.093
I know you went to her hotel,

41:50.160 --> 41:52.662

41:53.730 --> 41:55.865
I wish my dad
coulda met you.

41:55.932 --> 41:59.702
He'd see how rich
I turned out to be.

42:07.609 --> 42:09.678
[ Man ]
Marty, did you know?
No, I had no idea.

42:09.745 --> 42:11.980
I just found out
in the courtroom,
just like the rest of you.

42:12.047 --> 42:14.215
I was stunned.
Why'd you kill him,
Mr. Heric?

42:14.282 --> 42:17.518
I didn't like his politics.
Plus, he threatened
a loved one.

42:17.585 --> 42:19.587
I was prepared to go
with self-defense.

42:19.654 --> 42:21.622
Fortunately,
I was granted immunity.

42:21.689 --> 42:24.224
I think the main thing
is justice was served.

42:24.291 --> 42:26.226
And I'm proud to be
an American.

he killed somebody.

You know, I think
that eventually Marty
and everyone will realize...

42:39.739 --> 42:42.108
I didn't have to get
on the stand and admit it,

42:42.286 --> 42:47.019

my final destination.

42:47.086 --> 42:50.519

the truth came out here today
with a splendor.
