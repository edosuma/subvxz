Oh boy! One last piece and
I'm finally done with my puzzle!

00:38.440 --> 00:39.800
[gasps] Oh no!

00:40.000 --> 00:41.720
The last piece! It's missing!

00:46.120 --> 00:48.640
Why, Ollie, it's right here!

00:49.040 --> 00:50.640
Moon! Where did you find it?

00:50.839 --> 00:52.800
Where else?
Right where I left it!

00:54.080 --> 00:55.559
In the couch cushions.

00:55.839 --> 00:57.519
We make a great team, Moon!

00:57.720 --> 00:59.040
You said it, Ollie!

00:59.239 --> 01:01.480
Like mac and cheese!
Ice cream and sprinkles!

Couches and puzzle pieces!

[crash]

01:07.880 --> 01:08.960
Whoa!

01:10.320 --> 01:12.039
[efforts]

01:12.360 --> 01:13.280
[sighs]

01:13.479 --> 01:15.640
Scoot? Is that you?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.399
Ollie? Moon?

01:17.600 --> 01:19.440
Wow! Nice to see you!

01:19.840 --> 01:22.839
Only I was on my way to Berlin.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.800
I must've taken a wrong turn!

01:25.000 --> 01:26.759
A way-wrong turn.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.119
Berlin is
really far away from here!

01:29.399 --> 01:31.479
Yeah. You haven't seen
my travel buddy,

01:31.679 --> 01:33.839
Gunther Goose The Third,
have you?

01:33.960 --> 01:35.399
-Er...
-No.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.520
[Scoot] We were headed
to Berlin together.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.600
But I must've lost him.

01:39.960 --> 01:44.080
I guess Gunther Goose III
went to Berlin without me!

01:44.280 --> 01:46.160
Oh oh!
How will you find him now?

01:46.280 --> 01:48.360
Berlin is such a big city!

01:48.559 --> 01:52.360
No problem!
I'm having a big brainstorm!

01:52.559 --> 01:53.920
-We'll help you!
-We will?!

01:54.119 --> 01:55.640
-You will?
-Of course!

01:55.960 --> 01:59.520
I'm great at finding things,
and Ollie's great at maps!

01:59.720 --> 02:02.479
So we're the perfect team
for the job! C'mon!

02:02.679 --> 02:03.600
[music]

02:08.840 --> 02:09.720
Whoo!

02:10.840 --> 02:12.079
Whee!

02:19.320 --> 02:22.920
<i>Now arriving in Berlin, Germany.</i>

02:28.040 --> 02:29.720
Okay, Scoot. We need clues

02:29.920 --> 02:32.680
to where Gunther
Goose III might be waiting.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.760
What were you planning to do
today?

02:34.959 --> 02:37.000
We were going to get
some currywurst.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.799
That's a yummy German sausage.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.000
And have a picnic.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.679
Currywurst, eh?

02:43.799 --> 02:47.000
That's probably where we'll
find your friend the goose.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.840
At a currywurst joint.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.200
Good thinking, Moon!

02:50.400 --> 02:51.799
These maps will show us
where to go.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.320
Great! Okay, Scoot.
Let's see if-- Scoot?

02:55.519 --> 02:57.920
Now how did I wind up here?

02:58.120 --> 02:59.400
- Scoot!
- Scoot!

02:59.600 --> 03:01.239
Taken a wrong turn!

03:02.799 --> 03:03.880
[little laugh]

03:04.200 --> 03:05.799
Don't you just love maps?

03:05.920 --> 03:08.840
The pictures show you
exactly where to go.

03:08.959 --> 03:10.079
[baby talk] Yes they do.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.239
Who's a good map? You are!

03:12.440 --> 03:15.280
-You are!
-Ollie is the best map-reader.

03:15.399 --> 03:18.519
I usually just follow my nose,
but not Ollie!

03:18.720 --> 03:20.640
He never gets lost.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.120
He'll get us to all the places
we need to look.

03:23.519 --> 03:26.320
Actually, I was going to say
we should split up.

03:26.519 --> 03:27.640
-Split up?
-Split up?

03:27.760 --> 03:30.399
Uh-huh. To check
more currywurst spots faster.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.280
I've got two extra maps

03:32.480 --> 03:33.399
that you guys can use!

03:33.679 --> 03:36.239
So you want us to look
by ourselves?

03:36.440 --> 03:38.040
Not as a team. Mh.

03:38.239 --> 03:41.600
Without you reading the map
for us like usual?

03:41.799 --> 03:42.920
So many places to look!

03:43.200 --> 03:46.160
Finding him together would take
a week to ten days!

03:46.280 --> 03:48.239
Splitting up is the fastest way.

03:48.359 --> 03:49.880
I don't know, Ollie.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.399
Usually we work together,
with you reading the map.

03:53.799 --> 03:57.959
Yes, but this time we'll each
search our own areas, see?

03:58.440 --> 03:59.799
And call if we find him.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
We'll be back together
in no time!

04:02.200 --> 04:04.799
Are you sure
this is a good idea, Ollie?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.920
-I'm positive, Moon!
-But...

04:07.040 --> 04:09.320
Except--
I don't know if I can read this

04:09.440 --> 04:10.880
all by myself.

04:11.079 --> 04:12.600
Wokaaaay!

04:13.320 --> 04:14.560
Ehnn!

04:14.760 --> 04:16.920
[gasps]
I'm having a brainstorm!

04:17.120 --> 04:18.680
I'll just follow Ollie!

04:25.080 --> 04:26.520
[beep]

04:26.640 --> 04:28.360
Hi, Moon! Just checking in.

04:28.479 --> 04:29.320
You doing okay?

04:29.680 --> 04:31.479
Any problems with the map?

04:31.599 --> 04:33.520
Nope! Doing great!

04:33.719 --> 04:34.800
Find anything?

04:35.240 --> 04:36.039
Not yet.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.960
[sniffs] Mmm...

04:38.080 --> 04:39.560
I smell currywurst!

04:43.520 --> 04:44.360
Welcome

04:44.479 --> 04:46.360
to the Brandenburg Gate,

04:46.479 --> 04:48.039
Berlin's symbol of unity...

04:48.159 --> 04:50.400
Moon!
I found a currywurst food truck.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.960
Mmm. It smells so good!

04:53.159 --> 04:55.159
Do you see Gunther Goose III?

04:55.360 --> 04:57.240
-Sssh!
<i>-Hello?</i>

04:57.560 --> 04:58.960
Ollie, you there?

04:59.080 --> 05:00.320
Can you hear me?!

05:00.440 --> 05:01.599
[shouting] Did you find

05:01.800 --> 05:04.640
<i>Gunther Goose the Third?!</i>

05:04.760 --> 05:05.599
Sssh!

05:05.719 --> 05:06.880
Really sorry...

05:07.000 --> 05:09.039
I'm making too much noise, Moon.

05:09.159 --> 05:10.200
I need to hang up.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.159
Symbol of unity...

05:12.599 --> 05:15.280
[whispering]
Gunther Goose the Third?

05:16.200 --> 05:17.200
Are you here?

05:17.320 --> 05:18.960
Sshh!

05:19.200 --> 05:21.240
Ollie? Ollie?

05:21.360 --> 05:22.200
Ehn!

05:22.400 --> 05:23.360
[Moon] Where'd he go?

05:24.120 --> 05:25.560
Ehn...

05:27.039 --> 05:27.880
Mh!

05:28.400 --> 05:29.800
Ollie, there you are!

05:30.000 --> 05:32.640
I, er... managed to find you!

05:32.840 --> 05:34.840
Me, too!

05:34.960 --> 05:36.840
No sign of Gunther Goose III
here.

05:37.039 --> 05:38.640
-You didn't find him either?
-Err...

05:38.960 --> 05:41.400
Hum, not yet. Eh eh..

05:41.599 --> 05:43.039
Where should we look next?

05:43.280 --> 05:44.240
Mm.

05:44.359 --> 05:46.479
-We need another clue!
-Really?

05:46.680 --> 05:49.159
Oh good! Back to teamwork!

05:49.359 --> 05:53.719
Let's see. Scoot. You said
you were going on a picnic.

05:54.159 --> 05:56.919
Did Gunther Goose III
say where you might go?

05:57.120 --> 05:59.760
He just said "by the river".

05:59.880 --> 06:03.039
Ah-ha!
By. The. River.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.919
-Ollie?
-Mm.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.800
There are too many rivers
to check one by one.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.919
[gasps!] Let's split up again.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.760
-Split up? Again?!
-Split up? Again?!

06:11.960 --> 06:14.440
Are you sure
this is a good idea, Ollie?

06:14.640 --> 06:16.760
-I'm positive!
-But...

06:16.960 --> 06:18.880
Okay!

06:19.080 --> 06:20.840
[map rustles]

06:21.039 --> 06:23.799
Ah-ha!
I'll just follow Ollie again!

Mm-mm!

Mm.

Hm.

Ehhhh! Uh?

Mm.

Mh?

06:44.719 --> 06:45.640
Mm.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.440
Mmm...

06:49.960 --> 06:50.799
Weird.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.039
Yeeha!

07:00.479 --> 07:01.440
Mmm.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.719
Mmm.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.520
-Who are you?!
-Aaaah!

07:08.640 --> 07:10.599
-And why are you following me?!
-Wohaaaaa!

07:10.719 --> 07:11.560
Scoot!

07:12.000 --> 07:12.840
Hi, Moon!

07:13.039 --> 07:14.239
What are you doing here?

07:14.440 --> 07:15.919
Did you take a wrong turn again?

07:16.320 --> 07:18.760
Yeah! Well, no.

07:18.960 --> 07:22.120
Actually, I was afraid
of getting lost again.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.280
I'm no good with maps. I've been
following you the whole time.

07:26.479 --> 07:27.599
Oh, Scoot!

07:27.719 --> 07:30.960
I've been following
Ollie for the same reason!

07:31.159 --> 07:33.039
I was-- well...

07:33.239 --> 07:36.599
I was a little worried going off
without him so--

07:36.799 --> 07:38.320
[gasps] Oh no!

07:38.520 --> 07:39.359
Where'd he go?

07:39.560 --> 07:40.719
[shaking]

07:40.840 --> 07:43.840
First, Gunther Goose III!
Now, Ollie?

07:44.039 --> 07:46.320
Next I'll lose you! [gasps]

07:46.520 --> 07:47.680
Then me!

07:47.880 --> 07:50.200
Mh.. It's okay. I'll call him!

07:50.599 --> 07:53.120
Gunther Goose the Third!

07:53.560 --> 07:55.200
Hm, turn left here........

07:55.400 --> 07:56.919
[wind blows]
And-- no!

07:57.159 --> 07:59.159
What'll I do without my map?

07:59.359 --> 08:00.719
I better call Moon!

-No answer! Oh no!

08:06.560 --> 08:07.719
Aaaahhhhh!

08:07.919 --> 08:10.479
We have to find Ollie. But how?

08:10.599 --> 08:11.840
We have to figure out

08:12.039 --> 08:13.479
where he would go.

08:13.679 --> 08:16.239
We have to think like Ollie.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.760
[gasps] I know!

08:20.599 --> 08:22.919
I feel a lot more like Ollie
now.

08:23.039 --> 08:24.000
Me, too!

08:24.120 --> 08:27.719
And I think Ollie would be
looking for Gunther Goose III--

08:27.919 --> 08:29.760
Mm...[gasps]

08:29.880 --> 08:31.840
At a river with a park nearby!

08:31.960 --> 08:36.079
Where Gunther Goose III
might want to have a picnic!

08:36.280 --> 08:39.039
-C'mon, Scoot! This way!
-Okay!

08:40.280 --> 08:42.039
I mean, this way!

08:42.840 --> 08:43.880
Okay!

08:44.240 --> 08:46.720
Okay. Moon never uses a map.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.240
What would she do?

08:48.480 --> 08:51.120
She'd... Follow her nose!

08:51.240 --> 08:52.800
I'll just pretend I'm Moon.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.400
Okay, nose. Let's go!

09:02.800 --> 09:03.959
[crash] Whoa! [splash]

09:05.840 --> 09:06.720
-Ollie!
-Ollie!

09:06.840 --> 09:07.920
Moon! Scoot!

09:08.120 --> 09:09.560
How did you find us, Ollie?

09:09.680 --> 09:11.280
How did you find me, Moon?

09:11.400 --> 09:14.360
I was worried
about reading the map by myself

09:14.480 --> 09:16.680
so I followed you
until I found Scoot.

09:16.880 --> 09:20.280
Then we lost you! Then I asked,
what would you do?

09:20.480 --> 09:23.040
Well, I lost my map.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.520
First I was scared.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.280
Then I asked,
what would you do?

09:26.640 --> 09:29.720
And we all made it
to this perfect picnic spot!

09:29.839 --> 09:32.959
I know we'll find

a wrong turn and gotten lost!

10:13.920 --> 10:17.640
You know how
I can get lost sometimes.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.360
Currywurst, anyone?

10:19.560 --> 10:21.040
[yum, yum]

10:22.839 --> 10:23.839
You know, Ollie.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.800
It's good to know
we can get along by ourselves.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.520
But it's nicer
when we're a team.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.079
I know! Let's do everything
together from now on,

10:32.199 --> 10:33.040
forever!

10:33.319 --> 10:35.640
Yes!
And I know where to go first!

10:35.839 --> 10:37.439
The map store!

10:38.319 --> 10:39.439
[maps rustle]

10:39.640 --> 10:43.480
We can look at maps!
And read maps!

10:43.680 --> 10:46.640
And [sniffs] smell maps--

10:49.040 --> 10:53.520
You know, maybe we don't have
to do everything together.

10:53.719 --> 10:56.280
I'm just going
to follow my nose...

10:56.480 --> 10:57.680
Over there...

10:58.079 --> 10:59.680
[map rustles]
