█

00:01.034 --> 00:07.607
reads words on screen

00:10.009 --> 00:12.812
<i>Tonight, on the dramatic
season finale of</i>

00:12.879 --> 00:14.514
<i>Bachelor in Paradise Canada.</i>

00:14.581 --> 00:15.715
Last day...

00:15.782 --> 00:17.784
I do feel like there's something
that he's not telling me.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.819
Now is at the point where
we make a decision.

00:19.886 --> 00:23.356
You're gonna see if you can take
on the real world together.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.895
It's just a conversation
that turned into

00:28.962 --> 00:30.563
an epic battle.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.766
My heart is saying one thing
and my brain is

00:32.832 --> 00:34.834
saying something
totally different.

00:34.901 --> 00:37.003
I just need a man who can
use his brain

00:37.070 --> 00:38.805
and answer the question.

00:38.872 --> 00:42.542
Shit's hitting the fan and now
the fan's breaking off.

00:42.609 --> 00:45.612
I'm so ready for my
happy ending, finally.

00:45.678 --> 00:49.582
I could see myself, at the end
of this, giving her a ring.

00:49.649 --> 00:50.817
Angela...

00:55.321 --> 00:56.956
<i>And later, the campers
go head-to-head</i>

00:57.023 --> 00:58.425
<i>on After the Final Rose.</i>

00:58.491 --> 00:59.959
I also take blame
for some of that.

01:00.026 --> 01:02.395
Give him his airtime so he can
say his piece right now.

01:02.462 --> 01:03.663
You came in hot.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.532
It's kind of backhanded.
It makes no sense.

01:05.598 --> 01:06.699
And how'd that
work out for you?

01:06.766 --> 01:10.837
I'm a strong woman
and, I kind of lost myself.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.806
How was your best
friend's wedding?

01:12.872 --> 01:14.774
Vay...?

01:14.841 --> 01:17.811
I catch you at a bar in the
arms of another guy.

01:17.877 --> 01:19.279
You think it's a good idea
to be sitting there

01:19.345 --> 01:21.381
with your friends talking
shit about me?

01:21.448 --> 01:23.483
I have a screen shot of the
text message

01:23.550 --> 01:24.951
you sent me, Vay.
- I'm done.

01:25.018 --> 01:27.387
- You use that as an excuse now.
- I'm done! Honestly!

01:27.454 --> 01:28.621
Oh, my God.

01:28.688 --> 01:31.991
Give us an update.
What's the latest?

01:32.058 --> 01:33.927
Yeah, so, ah...
Ange is...

01:48.408 --> 01:51.377
We don't even have a plan to
see each other after this.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.946
Like I feel like this is
like an interview

01:53.012 --> 01:56.749
before me leaving Paradise. Like
it feels like nonsense to me.

01:56.816 --> 01:59.352
I was like, fantasy suite
sounds amazing.

01:59.419 --> 02:01.387
And, we'll have like a
great time together.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.557
And then, all of a sudden,
Caitlin is bombarding me

02:04.624 --> 02:06.759
with question,
after question.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.495
It feels to me like you
don't even want to

02:08.561 --> 02:09.896
take this outside of here.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.932
Quite frankly, I don't know
if I want to leave and

02:12.999 --> 02:15.535
work on anything if we
can't resolve it here.

02:15.602 --> 02:19.506
Caitlin, relax, please, like-
I'm, I'm getting to the point,

02:19.572 --> 02:21.808
I feel like this is a
prank or something.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.314
Oh, my God.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.852
Yeah, I just don't really know
what the going on,

02:32.919 --> 02:33.887
to be honest with you.

02:33.953 --> 02:36.523
- Kamil, I'm not- Oh, my God.
- It's crazy.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.961
I'm not trying to make you feel
down or pressured or anything.

02:42.028 --> 02:44.664
Right now my heart's
about to explode and like,

02:44.731 --> 02:48.101
I really don't know how I
feel about, like, you just...

02:48.168 --> 02:50.503
- Going at me like this.
- I'm just asking you questions.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.772
I know you are!
I know you are and,

02:52.839 --> 02:54.140
the questions are normal.

02:54.207 --> 02:55.942
But the way you're asking
them, it's like-

02:56.009 --> 02:56.976
How am I asking them?

02:57.043 --> 03:00.079
Caitlin, I haven't had my
heart beat like this

03:00.146 --> 03:02.549
with you around.
I don't know, it's not,

03:02.615 --> 03:05.418
it's not the same Caitlin
that you were 3 hours ago.

03:05.485 --> 03:07.754
I don't know what happened.

03:07.820 --> 03:11.591
Can you give me like
2 minutes, please?

03:14.727 --> 03:17.096
I'm like worried right now
because I don't know

03:17.163 --> 03:19.866
what to do and, I don't know
where this night will lead.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.101
This is heading into a
direction that

03:22.168 --> 03:24.070
I don't know the
outcome of it.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.172
What did I do wrong
by asking all of that?

03:26.239 --> 03:27.206
Did I pepper him?

03:27.273 --> 03:29.542
Like, now I feel like I'm
just a terrible person

03:29.609 --> 03:31.177
for even asking all of that.

03:31.244 --> 03:33.146
I just can't keep it
together, man.

03:33.212 --> 03:36.783
Like, this is bringing back
moments like, like no other.

03:36.849 --> 03:38.885
Shit's hitting the fan and
hitting the fan

03:38.952 --> 03:39.786
and hitting the fan.

03:39.852 --> 03:41.854
And now the fan's
breaking off.

03:41.921 --> 03:45.692
It's just way, way
too much, man.

03:45.758 --> 03:49.596
I'm having flashbacks like
to my bad time in Paradise,

03:49.662 --> 03:51.497
when I was sitting in
the hot seat, like,

03:51.564 --> 03:53.766
and the whole world
hated me, man.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.668
It was like a nightmare,
and I can't believe

03:55.735 --> 03:57.704
it's happening for
the second time.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.772
This is not the Caitlin
that I met.

03:59.839 --> 04:02.976
And this is not the
Caitlin that I recognize.

04:03.042 --> 04:05.478
This is not the Caitlin
that he saw before.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.714
Like, why, ́cause I
stood up for myself?

04:07.780 --> 04:09.882
́Cause I asked the shit
that I need to know,

04:09.949 --> 04:13.119
I'm not the sweet, like,
complacent Caitlin.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.488
Like, that pisses me off.

04:15.555 --> 04:18.224
I'm not gonna be that
guy that, you know,

04:18.291 --> 04:19.726
is gonna be holding
her hand and,

04:19.792 --> 04:21.995
and reassuring her every
5 seconds, like...

04:22.061 --> 04:23.763
And he's gotta hold me
accountable and

04:23.830 --> 04:25.898
reassure me every-
[beep], man.

04:25.965 --> 04:27.533
I wanted to show
her how important this is

04:27.600 --> 04:28.768
for both of us.

04:28.835 --> 04:31.204
Then show me, Kamil!
Then show me, Kamil!

04:31.271 --> 04:32.805
Like, [beep]!

04:34.807 --> 04:36.876
This is mind-blowing.
It's literally mind-blowing.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.678
Like, it's just a
conversation that

04:38.745 --> 04:40.880
turned into an
epic battle.

04:42.915 --> 04:45.251
Kamil, I'm not trying
to come at you.

04:45.318 --> 04:48.721
Caitlin, I don't need to
reassure you every single day.

04:48.788 --> 04:49.622
I don't need to
hold your hand.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.125
Like, this is so
incredibly frustrating.

04:52.191 --> 04:55.928
Like, it's not that I need a
man who needs to reassure me.

04:55.995 --> 04:58.564
I just need a man who can
use his brain and

04:58.631 --> 05:00.566
answer the question.

05:03.302 --> 05:06.572
like a nightmare to me.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.709
I am really frustrated because
she was doubting me.

05:09.776 --> 05:12.011
Life is coming tomorrow.
Are you scared of tomorrow?

05:12.078 --> 05:13.913
- Yeah, I'm a little scared!
- Of what?

05:13.980 --> 05:17.650
Like all of the things that
come with a relationship.

05:17.717 --> 05:19.619
Okay, so are you
scared of getting into

05:19.686 --> 05:21.688
a relationship with me?

05:23.656 --> 05:26.626
I wanted it to be a smooth
transition into the real world,

05:26.693 --> 05:28.928
but right now I, there is
no transition.

05:28.995 --> 05:32.098
There's always been a doubt in
your mind about me and...

05:32.165 --> 05:34.634
it's not a good feeling
to have, as a guy.

05:34.701 --> 05:38.037
The reason I asked those
questions is because...

05:38.104 --> 05:39.906
- ...I'm passionate about it.
- And so am I, Caitlin.

05:39.972 --> 05:42.608
- Because I like you and-
- And so do I, Caitlin.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.010
I want something more with you.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.646
This is my time to
make a choice

05:46.713 --> 05:48.848
that's going to
be best for me.

05:48.915 --> 05:52.085
And if I don't get that this
evening then, unfortunately,

05:52.151 --> 05:54.654
like, I just have to walk away.

05:54.721 --> 05:57.790
I don't want to like have
gone through all of this,

05:57.857 --> 06:03.296
knowing that we tried this hard
with one another for nothing.

06:03.362 --> 06:04.964
- Why would it be for nothing?
- Kamil-

06:05.031 --> 06:06.933
But why are you saying,
"for nothing"?

06:11.204 --> 06:12.672
What do you want to do?

06:12.739 --> 06:15.174
I mean, I want to talk to you
more about it tonight,

06:15.241 --> 06:16.976
in private.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.946
- Okay, let's figure it out.
- Yeah.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.621
There's still so many
unanswered things.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.723
My heart is saying one thing
and my brain

06:30.790 --> 06:33.025
is saying something
totally different.

06:33.092 --> 06:36.229
I was ready to just go into
the sunset with Caitlin.

06:36.295 --> 06:38.598
And now we are both left in
a spot where like

06:38.664 --> 06:40.767
our relationship is just
crumbling at the end.

07:00.953 --> 07:04.724
- Oh, wow, look at this.
- Mm...

07:04.791 --> 07:06.926
This is a big night because it's
the last night of Paradise.

07:06.993 --> 07:10.129
You're basically gonna see if,
you know, you and your,

07:10.196 --> 07:12.265
your partner can take on
the real world together.

07:12.331 --> 07:14.967
- Excited?
- Yeah, I am.

07:15.034 --> 07:16.803
I mean, I think
we have things that

07:16.869 --> 07:20.406
we have to talk
about, but, yeah.

07:20.473 --> 07:23.309
I'm feeling confident
in my feelings.

07:23.376 --> 07:27.213
I have tried to let him
know where I'm at.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.183
But I don't think he's
getting it exactly.

07:30.249 --> 07:32.051
-
- Oh, okay.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.855
So, tonight, I want to make
sure I express those feelings

07:35.922 --> 07:39.425
to Brendan in a way
that he understands.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.127
Last day.

07:41.194 --> 07:44.163
I didn't see that coming.

07:44.230 --> 07:48.868
I hope it's an eye-opening
conversation for the both of us.

07:48.935 --> 07:51.037
I have been thinking about

07:51.103 --> 07:54.373
all the conversations
that we've had.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.310
And, through a lot of
our conversations,

07:57.376 --> 08:02.215
you kind of just say, "Yes.
Whatever makes you happy".

08:02.281 --> 08:04.684
Mhm.

08:04.750 --> 08:10.389
I just want him to give
me his own opinions,

08:10.456 --> 08:12.758
instead of agreeing
with my opinions.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.861
Like, that's
pretty major to me.

08:14.927 --> 08:18.130
You can't possibly agree
with me all the time.

08:18.197 --> 08:21.334
And I feel like you don't,
but you don't tell me.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.370
Right. So, what's
your question?

08:24.437 --> 08:25.504
I don't know.

08:25.571 --> 08:29.942
I feel like you don't share
the same concerns as me,

08:30.009 --> 08:31.777
to the same degree.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.447
What, what exactly do
you want to know?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.816
I need...

08:36.883 --> 08:40.052
to really know more...

08:40.119 --> 08:44.790
about you, about where we are,
about where we're headed.

08:44.857 --> 08:48.861
I just get the game face,
let me smile for the cameras.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.429
That's not real life.

08:50.496 --> 08:54.133
I worry that he's not actually
thinking about the work and

08:54.200 --> 08:56.102
sacrifices and
challenges and

08:56.168 --> 08:57.970
obstacles that you're gonna
have to overcome as

08:58.037 --> 08:59.906
individuals and then
as a couple.

08:59.972 --> 09:03.309
I want to come together and do
these awesome things with you.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.510
I really do.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.445
And, I want to help you with
the company you're growing.

09:06.512 --> 09:07.480
Like, that's the
coolest thing.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.216
I would love to hear about
all of that as well,

09:10.283 --> 09:12.018
and help you in
every single way.

09:12.084 --> 09:15.454
That's definitely
not what I want.

09:15.521 --> 09:18.257
I don't need somebody
who just wants to

09:18.324 --> 09:20.826
do whatever I want to do.

09:26.132 --> 09:28.467
Like, tell- like, what are
some of the things that-

09:28.534 --> 09:30.202
I mean, it just- it feels like
a first date, it's like,

09:30.269 --> 09:31.804
what are your hobbies?
It's like, I don't know-

09:31.871 --> 09:33.205
I know. Well, it kind of-

09:33.272 --> 09:35.174
it is because,
babe, this whole time,

09:35.241 --> 09:38.077
we've just been like this,
and laughing-

09:38.144 --> 09:41.080
Do you really think I just sit-
- No, I don't!

09:41.147 --> 09:42.448
I don't sit at home,
I don't-

09:42.548 --> 09:45.885
That- no, but now you're making
it- no, that's not what I think.

09:45.952 --> 09:48.154
Just listen, I know.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.789
I just don't think
it's clicking.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.824
That's not all
that there is.

09:51.891 --> 09:55.161
There is a serious
side to this.

09:55.227 --> 10:00.066
Brendan, I feel like there's
a lot you don't tell me.

10:00.132 --> 10:04.236
And you say that you've
told me, but you don't.

10:04.303 --> 10:08.341
You keep it very
surface level.

10:08.407 --> 10:11.177
A lot of people close to me
know I put on that, that,

10:11.243 --> 10:13.980
that happy face all the time
and, you know, someone like me,

10:14.046 --> 10:17.483
I can't look at negatives too
much ́cause it gets me in a,

10:17.550 --> 10:19.285
in a bad place.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.287
Some days, like, you know,
you can wake up and,

10:21.354 --> 10:24.290
I just try to do anything in
my power to just

10:24.357 --> 10:27.093
stay away from
the dark days.

10:27.159 --> 10:29.328
We've spoken about all of
these things, you know.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.564
But you haven't really
shared that much with me.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.366
I'm not trying
to frustrate you.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.568
He says that he has bad days,
and he says that, you know,

10:35.634 --> 10:37.903
he's missing his family and
he's just missing

10:37.970 --> 10:39.472
the things that
he left behind.

10:39.538 --> 10:41.140
But I do feel like there's
something that

10:41.207 --> 10:42.375
he's not telling me.

10:42.441 --> 10:45.144
Like something deeper
inside of him that

10:45.211 --> 10:46.579
I think he struggles with.

10:46.645 --> 10:49.348
Now is at the point where
we make a decision.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.150
Does he want to be with me

10:51.217 --> 10:54.053
because he truly feels
that in his core?

10:54.120 --> 10:57.423
Or, do you like the idea
of being with me?

10:57.490 --> 11:01.394
We might just be on, like,
two different pages, like-

11:01.460 --> 11:03.362
I can't control your
feelings, Illeana.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.064
I just can't.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.402
I, personally, can't
confidently walk out of here

11:09.468 --> 11:10.403
hand-in-hand and say...

11:10.469 --> 11:12.371
- That's totally fine.
- ...it's gonna work.

11:15.107 --> 11:17.243
I don't, I don't know
what else to say.

11:30.589 --> 11:34.326
I very much did fall in
love with you here.

11:34.393 --> 11:38.631
But I feel like maybe...

11:38.697 --> 11:42.101
I fell in love with you
the way

11:42.168 --> 11:45.004
a teenager falls in love
at a summer camp,

11:45.071 --> 11:49.475
right, hanging out
with each other and...

11:49.542 --> 11:54.480
drinking prosecco,
and smiling and laughing.

11:54.547 --> 11:58.617
We did fall in love, but as
we got closer to leaving,

11:58.684 --> 12:01.654
I started to think
like an adult.

12:01.721 --> 12:06.992
I don't want to create this
like false expectation and

12:07.059 --> 12:09.428
reality of what we are.

12:09.495 --> 12:13.365
If my gut is telling me that
I'm not ready for this type of

12:13.432 --> 12:17.470
commitment in the adult world,
I have to listen to it,

12:17.536 --> 12:21.674
to not do myself an injustice.

12:21.740 --> 12:26.645
I just, yeah, I mean,
you've been...

12:29.048 --> 12:32.151
I can't think about if it's,
if it's over, if...

12:32.218 --> 12:37.957
you know, or if we'll never
talk again or see each other.

12:38.023 --> 12:39.725
I'm just scared.

12:51.470 --> 12:54.607
I have to walk away.

12:54.673 --> 12:57.109
I don't think that going to
the fantasy suite

12:57.176 --> 13:00.079
would change anything.

13:00.146 --> 13:04.450
In fact, it could only end up
hurting him more.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.051
I'm just not ready.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.687
I know, babe.

13:08.754 --> 13:10.523
I'm just not ready.

13:10.589 --> 13:13.993
I know, I know, I know.

13:17.062 --> 13:21.233
Seeing her walk away,
it's just...

13:21.300 --> 13:26.305
it's not good.
It's not good.

13:26.372 --> 13:29.141
Just from the conversations
we've had the last couple days

13:29.208 --> 13:30.643
and with the energy shift,
it was kind of like

13:30.709 --> 13:33.379
the calm before the storm.

13:33.445 --> 13:35.514
But, when you finally have
that conversation,

13:35.581 --> 13:38.784
that's the toughest part.

13:38.851 --> 13:42.221
It's tough to even
grasp right now.

13:42.288 --> 13:45.057
You know, I'm gonna miss her.
I'm gonna miss her.

13:48.294 --> 13:51.063
Hurting someone that I
deeply care about,

13:51.130 --> 13:53.065
I don't want to do that.

13:57.236 --> 13:58.737
I think that there's a
side of Brendan that

13:58.804 --> 14:01.040
he'll never share
with the world.

14:01.106 --> 14:04.343
And, I think he'll probably
put on his game face and

14:04.410 --> 14:07.279
say that everything's okay.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.749
But, I don't want to come out
of here doing him a disservice

14:10.816 --> 14:15.688
by pretending everything is
great when my gut says it's not.

14:35.574 --> 14:38.711
Today is our last day
in Paradise.

14:38.777 --> 14:40.479
You look so good.
How do you wake up like this?

14:40.546 --> 14:43.182
Stop!
I don't look good.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.417
- Yeah, you do.
- You're sweet.

14:45.484 --> 14:47.219
Last night I felt at ease.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.355
I felt like it was
the perfect night.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.257
It was nice getting to talk to
you last night though.

14:51.323 --> 14:54.793
I know, it was.
Just that alone time.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.729
Our date was amazing.

14:56.795 --> 14:59.698
Brendan M. told me that he's
falling in love with me.

14:59.765 --> 15:03.102
And, I feel the same.

15:03.168 --> 15:04.203
Yeah, real life.

15:04.270 --> 15:05.704
I'm excited for
real life actually.

15:05.771 --> 15:07.539
- I am too.
- Mhm.

15:07.606 --> 15:09.441
The fantasy suite gave
Ange and I a glimpse of

15:09.508 --> 15:11.310
what the real world
might be like.

15:11.377 --> 15:14.146
- My skin is burning.
- No, it's not!

15:14.213 --> 15:16.181
This is all natural.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.851
My face is on fire right now.
- This is all natural.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.721
I feel very happy at
where Ange and I are.

15:22.788 --> 15:24.456
- Whoa!
-

15:24.523 --> 15:26.592
I think it's pretty obvious
that Ange and I

15:26.659 --> 15:28.294
are gonna be leaving
Paradise together.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.230
It's just a matter of
whether she's gonna be

15:31.297 --> 15:32.898
leaving with
a ring or not.

15:49.348 --> 15:52.918
Last night was a shit night.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.653
My intent was just to,
you know,

15:54.720 --> 15:57.156
have a conversation with my
boyfriend about some things

15:57.222 --> 15:59.892
that were weighing heavy on me.

15:59.958 --> 16:04.797
And it just became an absolute
nightmare of an evening.

16:04.863 --> 16:08.400
Our communication styles are
quite different and,

16:08.467 --> 16:12.404
today I'm, I'm sad.

16:12.471 --> 16:16.508
The conversation
didn't go as planned.

16:16.575 --> 16:19.578
But, I mean, at least we were
able to have some time alone

16:19.645 --> 16:21.880
last night to chat a
bit more and...

16:21.947 --> 16:28.220
can figure out the next
steps in all of this.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.957
I saw a side of Caitlin
last night that, I mean,

16:32.024 --> 16:35.327
I haven't seen here
before in Paradise.

16:35.394 --> 16:37.830
It was one question,
after another question,

16:37.896 --> 16:40.699
after another, after another,
after another.

16:40.766 --> 16:43.502
I really don't know
where we stand.

16:43.569 --> 16:47.439
It's not a good feeling.

16:49.408 --> 16:52.444
It's alright, come here.

16:56.615 --> 16:59.618
I didn't want it to
go like that.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.521
It's okay, I'm here for you.

17:05.724 --> 17:09.228
It'll be okay, alright?
Just trust me.

17:12.898 --> 17:15.300
I'm crazy about him.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.236
Alright.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.878
There's a lot going through
my head right now.

17:25.944 --> 17:30.382
Especially of what has
happened in the last few days.

17:30.449 --> 17:34.853
Leaving not sure and not
feeling 100% confident

17:34.920 --> 17:37.990
in what you have
is very scary.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.992
My mind is
scattered right now.

17:40.058 --> 17:42.628
We still have a lot
to think about.

17:55.741 --> 17:59.745
This is a big moment
for Caitlin and I.

17:59.812 --> 18:06.051
I feel very unsure about
where this is headed.

18:06.118 --> 18:09.822
I know there's some things
that were left unfinished.

18:13.692 --> 18:17.729
I'm nervous.
I'm sad.

18:17.796 --> 18:20.999
Last night, I went into the
evening knowing that there

18:21.066 --> 18:23.435
were certain things I
needed to address.

18:27.973 --> 18:31.810
There were, you know, moments
where I did feel gaslit.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.084
I'm allowed to ask those
questions and

18:39.151 --> 18:41.086
I'm allowed to want answers.

18:41.153 --> 18:42.354
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.724
I'm looking forward to see
what he has to say.

18:56.935 --> 18:58.837
Hey.

19:03.108 --> 19:07.579
Caitlin, from the first day in
Paradise that you set foot on

19:07.646 --> 19:11.817
this beach, I knew that we
had something special.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.119
You're such an amazing
person, Caitlin.

19:14.186 --> 19:16.455
You're such a
beautiful, strong,

19:16.522 --> 19:18.924
independent, caring woman.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.493
You made me a
better person and,

19:21.560 --> 19:25.564
my feelings for you
are so strong.

19:25.631 --> 19:28.066
But last night, it was...

19:28.133 --> 19:30.469
such a tough time for me.

19:30.536 --> 19:34.106
I'm feeling a little bit,
you know,

19:34.173 --> 19:38.010
reserved in how to take our
relationship to the next level,

19:38.076 --> 19:41.613
leaving Paradise, and that
kind of scares me.

19:42.881 --> 19:46.118
But, my feelings for you will
always be there, Caitlin.

19:49.922 --> 19:54.593
I mean, you've shown
so much growth

19:54.660 --> 19:57.496
over however many days here.

19:57.563 --> 20:01.500
And you know, that's really all
I can ask from you.

20:01.567 --> 20:05.804
Last night was not the ideal
night for either of us and,

20:05.871 --> 20:09.141
I wish it could've
gone differently.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.944
But I think it opened
both of our eyes,

20:12.010 --> 20:14.146
and made us
realize that, you know,

20:14.212 --> 20:18.884
our best option right now is to
take a step back and...

20:18.951 --> 20:22.788
go our separate ways.

20:22.854 --> 20:25.557
Yeah....

20:25.624 --> 20:30.862
I know it's the best
choice for both of us and...

20:30.929 --> 20:34.600
I care about you so much.

20:34.666 --> 20:37.669
My heart has always
been with you and,

20:37.736 --> 20:40.906
I'll continue to
leave it with you.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.708
Thank you, Caitlin.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.115
- Yeah.
- Mhm.

21:01.226 --> 21:04.596
- Okay?
- Mhm.

21:10.168 --> 21:12.771
Okay.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.706
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:22.648 --> 21:25.217
I'm heartbroken, honestly.

21:25.284 --> 21:29.921
This is not how I wanted
all of this to end.

21:29.988 --> 21:34.793
Kamil is a, an
amazing person and

21:34.860 --> 21:39.231
I think he's so special.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.567
But we can't move forward
with the relationship in the

21:42.634 --> 21:47.139
real world if we don't have
a solid foundation here.

21:47.205 --> 21:49.675
Maybe we weren't
meant for each other.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.018
I wanted to walk
away holding hands.

22:03.321 --> 22:06.091
We were like right at
the finish line and,

22:06.158 --> 22:11.029
we tripped and fell and
tumbled and got hurt.

22:11.096 --> 22:13.699
What we have in Paradise...

22:13.765 --> 22:20.806
what we had as a couple,
I'm gonna try to get it back.

22:33.819 --> 22:36.955
I'm so ready for my
happy ending, finally.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.590
The guy of my dreams.

22:38.657 --> 22:41.560
He's gorgeous, and funny,
and smart, and caring.

22:41.626 --> 22:44.196
He makes me feel so special.

22:44.262 --> 22:48.800
I haven't felt this way with
somebody this quickly, ever.

22:51.369 --> 22:54.239
There's two ways that Angela
and I could leave Paradise.

22:54.306 --> 22:57.976
You know, we could leave
engaged or hand-in-hand.

22:58.043 --> 23:03.048
But one way or another, I plan
on leaving with Angela, so...

23:03.115 --> 23:05.016
I can't, I can't lose.

23:07.686 --> 23:09.755
Hi.

23:09.821 --> 23:11.656
Brendan...

23:14.793 --> 23:19.765
I came into this so optimistic
and with an open heart.

23:19.831 --> 23:24.269
And, I'm just so thankful
that I've met you.

23:24.336 --> 23:27.372
I feel like you just
see me for me.

23:27.439 --> 23:30.842
We haven't had the
easiest of journeys,

23:30.909 --> 23:33.745
but it's made us
that much stronger.

23:33.812 --> 23:37.983
Haven't felt like this so
quickly with anybody, ever.

23:38.049 --> 23:40.085
I feel like I've
always known you.

23:40.152 --> 23:43.155
Falling in love with you has
just been effortless.

23:43.221 --> 23:44.990
It's been so easy.

23:45.056 --> 23:48.860
I'm ready to go out into
the real world and...

23:48.927 --> 23:51.163
and see what happens, and...

23:51.229 --> 23:55.100
I'm excited to be a
team with you.

23:55.167 --> 24:00.705
So, thank you for being here
and for choosing me.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.707
Thank you for that.

24:05.443 --> 24:06.912
Angela...

24:08.747 --> 24:11.650
Honestly, you are,
you are one of a kind.

24:11.716 --> 24:13.251
Coming into this experience,

24:13.318 --> 24:15.954
I really didn't know
what to expect.

24:16.021 --> 24:19.291
I definitely didn't expect
meeting someone like you.

24:19.357 --> 24:21.660
You know, someone
who was beautiful,

24:21.726 --> 24:23.395
but not only beautiful.

24:23.461 --> 24:28.900
You're smart, you're kind,
funny- sometimes.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.006
No, but that first day when I
met you on that beach,

24:35.073 --> 24:36.775
I knew that there was
something special there.

24:36.842 --> 24:40.412
We've definitely had our share
of ups and downs and,

24:40.479 --> 24:42.981
those ups and downs
are what have

24:43.048 --> 24:44.983
ultimately led
us to, to now.

24:45.050 --> 24:47.786
So, I'm, I'm thankful for that.

24:47.853 --> 24:49.254
Yeah.

24:49.321 --> 24:52.290
I really couldn't imagine
sharing this experience

24:52.357 --> 24:53.925
with anybody else but you.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.160
Same.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.929
I couldn't imagine leaving
this experience

24:57.996 --> 24:59.698
with anyone else but you.

24:59.764 --> 25:00.899
Same.

25:00.966 --> 25:04.402
Rain or shine, so long as I'm
with you, I'm in Paradise.

25:04.469 --> 25:06.271
Aw...

25:06.338 --> 25:10.242
With that being said...

25:11.209 --> 25:13.044
Will you accept
this final rose, Angela?

25:13.111 --> 25:15.080
I sure will, thank you, sir.

25:15.146 --> 25:17.349
With pleasure.

25:17.415 --> 25:20.151
It smells amazing.

25:20.218 --> 25:23.788
Brendan...

25:23.855 --> 25:26.258
will you accept this
final rose from me?

25:26.324 --> 25:28.026
I will.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.498
Looks snazzy.

25:33.565 --> 25:34.966
Come here.

25:42.908 --> 25:44.342
I'm so, I'm so happy.
I really am.

25:44.409 --> 25:45.443
I am too.

25:45.510 --> 25:50.315
This is definitely the
beginning of something special.

25:50.382 --> 25:54.085
Our future is bright and
just filled with love.

25:54.152 --> 25:57.222
We're going.

25:57.289 --> 26:02.761
Mm, mine
Nobody else's.

26:02.827 --> 26:06.131
It hasn't worked out before,
but now I know why.

26:06.197 --> 26:09.467
I was just waiting for you
to come along.

26:09.534 --> 26:12.537
It feels amazing.

26:12.604 --> 26:17.943
I'm extremely lucky to find
this connection with Angela.

26:18.009 --> 26:23.148
One final walk on our dock?

26:23.214 --> 26:26.284
I'm not gonna be leaving
here wondering

26:26.351 --> 26:27.919
if we made the
right decision.

26:27.986 --> 26:30.155
I already know.

26:30.221 --> 26:32.791
This is just the beginning so,
I'm looking forward to...

26:32.857 --> 26:34.926
- Making more memories.
- Exactly.

26:36.561 --> 26:39.097
- We have to have a movie night.
- And call our families.

26:39.164 --> 26:41.232
- Oh, yeah, that too.
- That too.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.169
Paradise is for real, it works!

26:44.235 --> 26:47.339
Paradise is for real.
It really is, it really works.

27:01.152 --> 27:03.188
<i>Coming up, your favourite
Paradise campers</i>

27:03.254 --> 27:06.024
<i>come face to face,
on After the Final Rose.</i>

27:06.091 --> 27:08.026
Do you have a dartboard at
home with David's face on it?

27:08.093 --> 27:10.095
As long as there's no daggers
in my back, I'm good.

27:10.161 --> 27:12.130
That's fake news
and you know it.

27:12.197 --> 27:13.231
Maybe I agreed with
everything ́cause

27:13.298 --> 27:14.432
I didn't want
to it up.

27:14.499 --> 27:17.869
It doesn't seem fair to me
when I gave it my all.

27:17.936 --> 27:19.204
Your timing is
worse than Chris'.

27:19.270 --> 27:20.405
Vay, I caught you
with another guy,

27:20.472 --> 27:22.140
and that started
the entire thing!

27:26.511 --> 27:29.080
Welcome back to the
dramatic season finale of

27:29.147 --> 27:31.583
Bachelor in Paradise Canada.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.552
All of your favourite campers
are here tonight.

27:34.619 --> 27:36.588
They've got a lot to say.

27:36.654 --> 27:39.591
This season, we saw true
friendships form,

27:39.657 --> 27:43.328
hearts broken, love blossom.
And of course,

27:43.395 --> 27:47.165
it wouldn't be Paradise
without plenty of drama.

27:47.232 --> 27:49.267
How are the campers feeling
about their journey and

27:49.334 --> 27:51.603
each other now that Paradise
is behind them?

27:51.670 --> 27:53.872
And what happened to
our fan favourites

27:53.938 --> 27:55.440
after leaving Paradise?

27:55.507 --> 27:57.542
And later, we'll have
a special guest

27:57.609 --> 27:59.944
with a big announcement.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.580
It's going to be a very
revealing evening,

28:02.647 --> 28:06.384
and it all starts now.

28:06.451 --> 28:07.652
Welcome, campers.

28:07.719 --> 28:09.320
Great to see
everybody again.

28:09.387 --> 28:11.890
Illeana, looking
stunning as usual.

28:11.956 --> 28:13.525
Thank you, happy to be here.

28:13.591 --> 28:15.326
David...

28:15.393 --> 28:18.563
Okay, okay.

28:18.630 --> 28:21.499
- Brendan S., welcome.
- Thank you, thank you.

28:21.566 --> 28:23.201
- Kamil.
- What's up?

28:23.268 --> 28:25.103
Staying in your
own lane tonight?

28:25.170 --> 28:27.105
- Possibly.
- Possibly.

28:27.172 --> 28:28.640
Adam, how about you?

28:28.707 --> 28:30.208
You staying in your
own lane too?

28:30.275 --> 28:31.676
That's not really
my style, man.

28:31.743 --> 28:33.244
- Joey?
- Yes, sir.

28:33.311 --> 28:35.080
- Howdy, partner.
- How we doing?

28:35.146 --> 28:36.681
Ah, I'm good, man,
good to see you.

28:36.748 --> 28:38.583
- Angela, welcome.
- Hi...

28:38.650 --> 28:40.485
Maria, glad you could be here.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.320
Thanks, Jesse.

28:42.387 --> 28:45.423
- Stacy, can I get a laugh?
- We'll see, we'll see.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.192
- Okay.
-

28:47.258 --> 28:49.694
- Josh, welcome.
- What's good, man?

28:49.761 --> 28:53.198
Caitlin, great to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

28:53.264 --> 28:55.200
- Lisa...
- Hi, Jesse.

28:55.266 --> 28:57.001
- You ready for tonight?
- Very ready.

28:57.068 --> 28:57.936
Okay.

28:58.002 --> 29:01.039
Chris, Mr. Renaissance Man.
-

29:01.106 --> 29:02.474
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.

29:02.540 --> 29:05.510
- Vay, it's great to see you.
- Nice to see you as well.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.445
Brendan M., looking sharp.

29:07.512 --> 29:08.680
Appreciate it, man.

29:08.747 --> 29:09.948
Mike...

29:10.014 --> 29:12.283
or should I call you
Mack Truck Mike?

29:12.350 --> 29:14.052
Toot-toot, Jesse, toot-too.

29:16.221 --> 29:17.255
So, let's get to it.

29:17.355 --> 29:20.492
Paradise is filled with
beautiful, confident people.

29:20.558 --> 29:22.560
And it can be an
intimidating place,

29:22.627 --> 29:24.696
especially if you feel like
you don't fit in.

29:24.762 --> 29:27.532
Let's take a look at two of
our most talked about campers,

29:27.599 --> 29:29.367
Lisa and Chris,

29:29.434 --> 29:33.037
and their struggle to find
their place in Paradise.

29:35.540 --> 29:40.111
I've recently discovered how
much I don't know.

29:40.178 --> 29:43.515
I searched "how to win
ex-girlfriend back".

29:43.581 --> 29:45.116
Agh, I've done that.

29:45.183 --> 29:47.118
When it comes to like romance,
I'm like, alright,

29:47.185 --> 29:49.687
I am now a 16-year-old awkward
boy, and I have nothing to say,

29:49.754 --> 29:52.423
and I've never had any dates
and I'm just like...

29:52.490 --> 29:53.291
Enh!

29:53.358 --> 29:54.526
Look at your knee
touching my knee.

29:54.592 --> 29:55.660
- Do you think that's okay?
- Yeah, is that a connection?

29:55.727 --> 29:59.197
I genuinely feel like a
complete underdog story here.

29:59.264 --> 30:02.066
Shut up, I love Star Wars.

30:02.133 --> 30:05.436
Do I give off like too much
of a bro girl vibe?

30:05.503 --> 30:08.606
I put myself out there with
someone who you would look at

30:08.673 --> 30:10.575
and say, "hey, she's a bit
out of your league".

30:10.642 --> 30:14.012
And I took a
chance anyways.

30:14.078 --> 30:17.081
The kiss with Chris is, is...

30:17.148 --> 30:19.350
Oh, no.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.085
The only other connection
I've had with someone

30:21.152 --> 30:22.420
has been with Lisa.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.022
It's a different kind
of connection.

30:24.088 --> 30:25.590
Would you consider
yourself an outlier?

30:25.657 --> 30:26.791
Oh, for sure.

30:26.858 --> 30:29.093
I never felt like
I truly fit in.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.695
The way I navigate
through my life

30:30.762 --> 30:32.497
isn't how a lot
of people do it.

30:32.564 --> 30:33.665
You're kind of starting
to piss me off a bit.

30:33.731 --> 30:34.799
You're pissing me off.

30:34.866 --> 30:37.235
So, it's easy to be
misunderstood.

30:37.302 --> 30:38.403
- We kissed!
- What about Stacy?

30:38.469 --> 30:39.604
Man, you know what...

30:39.671 --> 30:41.139
You know what, dude,
I'm done here.

30:43.441 --> 30:46.644
I just feel like,
like an outcast.

30:46.711 --> 30:48.079
I can only hope for
the best, but like,

30:48.146 --> 30:49.214
what am I gonna do, right?

30:51.416 --> 30:54.085
- Real country girl now.
- I can't be looking at this.

30:54.152 --> 30:56.187
My self-esteem going,
woo!

30:56.254 --> 30:59.290
I feel if people were just a
little more understanding,

30:59.357 --> 31:00.558
we could get somewhere.

31:01.893 --> 31:03.194
I feel like I'm on The
Bachelor but for like

31:03.261 --> 31:05.129
platonic best friends.

31:09.367 --> 31:13.238
So, Lisa, we watched you
struggle a bit in Paradise.

31:13.304 --> 31:15.073
"A bit" is an
understatement.

31:15.139 --> 31:18.309
Why do you think it
was so hard for you?

31:18.376 --> 31:21.145
Honestly, it was just hard.
It was literally like walking

31:21.212 --> 31:23.615
around and seeing like
pairs of twos and like...

31:23.681 --> 31:25.416
you're one of the only people
running around that doesn't

31:25.483 --> 31:28.219
have that, it's just
frustrating to see.

31:28.286 --> 31:30.488
I think anybody
would feel that way.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.657
I don't want to cry.
I'm wearing a lot of makeup.

31:32.724 --> 31:33.725
You know, in the season,

31:33.791 --> 31:36.361
people saw you get emotional
from the beginning.

31:36.427 --> 31:38.196
I also take blame
for some of that.

31:38.263 --> 31:40.665
This guy is the #1 reason
so, give him his airtime

31:40.732 --> 31:41.866
so he can say his
piece right now.

31:41.933 --> 31:46.237
David, you came in knowing that
you had a past with Lisa.

31:46.304 --> 31:49.240
How do you feel about the way
that you handled yourself?

31:49.307 --> 31:53.544
My recollection about being
there is 95% happiness.

31:53.611 --> 31:55.747
When I see all these faces
and like, I just smile.

31:55.813 --> 31:58.449
I'm so thankful and fortunate
to have this opportunity

31:58.516 --> 32:00.551
́cause I have people that
I consider friends that

32:00.618 --> 32:02.153
I'll have for a
very long time.

32:02.220 --> 32:05.590
We saw a lot of tears
being shed by David.

32:05.657 --> 32:09.127
How many of you felt that those
tears were genuine?

32:09.193 --> 32:12.297
Show of hands, show of hands?

32:12.363 --> 32:14.465
How do you feel that I asked
the question to the group,

32:14.532 --> 32:16.367
and nobody raised their hand?

32:16.434 --> 32:18.169
It makes me feel disingenuine.

32:19.370 --> 32:22.206
- Disingenuous.
- There it is.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.909
Lisa, how do you feel
about him today?

32:24.976 --> 32:27.578
I mean, he's just not a
part of my life so...

32:27.645 --> 32:29.847
I don't talk to him, I don't
see him. Beyond this show,

32:29.914 --> 32:31.816
like, we'll probably never
communicate again.

32:31.883 --> 32:33.217
Do you have a dartboard
at home with

32:33.284 --> 32:34.452
David's face on
it that you...?

32:34.519 --> 32:36.621
No, he's not worth
the printer ink.

32:36.688 --> 32:39.590
As long as there's no daggers
in my back, I'm good.

32:39.657 --> 32:42.560
I mean, some of the campers
said, "Oh, man,

32:42.627 --> 32:45.229
Lisa, she's coming on
strong".

32:45.296 --> 32:47.398
That's fake news
and you know it.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.701
Joey, you did mention
throughout the season that-

32:49.767 --> 32:52.170
Yeah, let's hear the defense
on that, let's debate.

32:52.236 --> 32:54.272
...maybe Lisa was coming
on a bit strong, so-

32:54.339 --> 32:55.473
Too thirsty.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.508
Obviously, you want to go in
and make a first impression.

32:57.575 --> 32:59.677
From my standpoint as a guy,
I just know,

32:59.744 --> 33:01.612
the first girl running at me,
I'm like...

33:01.679 --> 33:02.647
Ah...

33:05.016 --> 33:05.983
- Chris.
- Yeah.

33:06.050 --> 33:09.287
You came in hot.
What do you think went wrong?

33:09.354 --> 33:11.456
There's a lot going on
in my head.

33:11.522 --> 33:13.424
I'm saying things that I watch
back later and I'm like,

33:13.491 --> 33:14.559
that was completely
embarrassing.

33:14.625 --> 33:16.561
And I'm now, now gonna add
that to the list of things

33:16.627 --> 33:18.196
I'm never gonna say
again, you know.

33:18.262 --> 33:19.397
Like, I learn.

33:19.464 --> 33:22.734
Let's talk about the kisses
with Chris, right, Caitlin?

33:22.800 --> 33:24.736
- Oh, why.
- And Stacy.

33:24.802 --> 33:26.537
You can learn a lot from a kiss.

33:26.604 --> 33:28.339
I was not playing
Chris for a rose.

33:28.406 --> 33:30.408
I think I was searching for a
connection and hoping that

33:30.475 --> 33:31.876
there was going to be one there.

33:31.943 --> 33:34.679
I was exploring a path
that I had not explored.

33:34.746 --> 33:37.281
And, at the end of the day,
it just, it wasn't there.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.550
- Caitlin, what about you?
- Honestly, the same.

33:39.617 --> 33:42.253
Why wouldn't I have taken
the opportunity to explore

33:42.320 --> 33:44.288
something with another
camper on the beach that was

33:44.355 --> 33:46.224
clearly interested
in me as well?

33:46.290 --> 33:50.294
It ultimately didn't work out,
and there wasn't a spark for me.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.330
I don't think it was
malicious at all.

33:52.397 --> 33:54.532
I was going in with the same
intent that Chris was

33:54.599 --> 33:56.501
when he was exploring
other connections

33:56.567 --> 33:58.336
throughout his
time on the beach.

33:58.403 --> 34:00.338
What do you think of
those kisses now?

34:00.405 --> 34:03.674
I'm glad
I went for it.

34:03.741 --> 34:06.277
At the end of the day, like
that's what you're there for.

34:06.344 --> 34:08.012
I mean, if you're not gonna
even try like you might

34:08.079 --> 34:09.514
as well just not
even show up.

34:09.580 --> 34:13.684
Yes, you know, Stacy kissed you.
Yes, Caitlin...

34:13.751 --> 34:14.652
did as well.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.288
You shot that shot and
it didn't really...

34:17.355 --> 34:18.256
amount to anything.

34:18.322 --> 34:21.926
It was very apparent
that it was not... real.

34:21.993 --> 34:23.561
I don't know
where that's coming from.

34:23.628 --> 34:28.366
I think where it does change is
when someone comes in,

34:28.433 --> 34:30.368
confess their love, or they're,
"You know what,

34:30.435 --> 34:32.403
I just, I've just liked
you forever".

34:32.470 --> 34:35.673
And meanwhile, they just
came off of making out with

34:35.740 --> 34:38.743
somebody else or got
shutdown by somebody else.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.611
And then went straight to the
next person and goes,

34:40.678 --> 34:42.980
"You know what,
I love you now".

34:43.047 --> 34:46.517
I don't know if it felt real to
you or what, but it was not-

34:46.584 --> 34:47.718
I don't know how you
can say that at all.

34:47.785 --> 34:50.388
Like, how can you speak
for my feelings?

34:50.455 --> 34:53.024
Well, no, it may be real, like,
in one of your dimensions,

34:53.090 --> 34:58.463
but it's like in real life,
it's not real, man.

34:58.529 --> 35:00.865
Coming up, fan favourites,
Joey and Vay

35:00.932 --> 35:03.468
left Paradise ready to
take on the world.

35:03.534 --> 35:06.370
They will join me onstage
for a dramatic update.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.806
And later, one of our most
talked about couples,

35:08.873 --> 35:11.442
Caitlin and Kamil,
will take the hot seat.

35:11.509 --> 35:12.510
Stay with us.

35:21.419 --> 35:25.389
Welcome back to the Bachelor in
Paradise Canada season finale.

35:25.456 --> 35:27.725
What happens when a
Speedo-sporting cowboy from

35:27.792 --> 35:32.597
Alberta meets a posh bilingual
real estate agent from Toronto?

35:32.663 --> 35:34.932
Well, they fall in love,
of course.

35:34.999 --> 35:36.701
Let's take a look
back at the most

35:36.767 --> 35:39.604
unlikely romance
in Paradise.

35:42.807 --> 35:45.743
- Hi, cowboy.
- Hi, everyone.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.712
- Wow.
- Wow.

35:47.778 --> 35:48.880
I'd like to take the
time to maybe

35:48.946 --> 35:49.847
get a one-on-one
with her and

35:49.914 --> 35:52.083
see if she can handle a
little bit of Alberta.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.351
Get after it.

35:57.955 --> 35:59.023
Well, shit.

35:59.090 --> 36:01.492
- You're a good kisser.
- So are you.

36:01.559 --> 36:03.494
Is he the type of guy I
would normally go for?

36:03.561 --> 36:06.531
- No. He's not, but...

36:06.597 --> 36:08.733
I need a guy that
makes me laugh.

36:08.799 --> 36:11.435
Now I'm just feeling
good-ah-ah.

36:11.502 --> 36:13.104
And that's,
honestly, it's Joey.

36:13.170 --> 36:14.038
Yeehaw!

36:14.105 --> 36:16.140
- Will you accept this rose?
- Of course.

36:16.207 --> 36:18.409
- Joey!
- What?

36:18.476 --> 36:19.677
Vay, do you want to have a
conversation right now?

36:19.744 --> 36:22.580
Yeah, let's go, let's go.
Chris, let's go.

36:22.647 --> 36:23.915
Let's go.

36:23.981 --> 36:26.050
Vay seems cool.
Why is she with Joey?

36:26.117 --> 36:27.752
Who would you see me with?

36:27.818 --> 36:30.855
No one that's
available right now.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.790
He keeps making
comments about Joey

36:32.857 --> 36:35.092
that's like mind me.

36:35.159 --> 36:38.829
Like, it's weird. He was
just with my head.

36:38.896 --> 36:41.832
Don't mess with
my people.

36:41.899 --> 36:44.068
Well, I mean, Paradise has
been pretty good so far.

36:44.135 --> 36:47.004
Guys, does it mean I really like
him if I'm stressed right now?

36:47.071 --> 36:48.139
- Yes!
-

36:48.206 --> 36:50.074
At this point, he has
a girlfriend and

36:50.141 --> 36:53.411
all I'm hearing
is about a girl.

36:53.477 --> 36:55.479
I'm scared of the outcome of

36:55.546 --> 36:57.548
the possibility of
maybe losing her.

36:57.615 --> 37:00.751
I hate that I'm the reason
that you felt the way

37:00.818 --> 37:04.989
you did yesterday
́cause I love you.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.458
I know I'm falling
in love with you.

37:07.525 --> 37:08.392
He's my person.

37:08.459 --> 37:10.795
At the end of the day,
you're my girl and

37:10.861 --> 37:12.029
that's all I care about.

37:12.096 --> 37:16.467
I cannot believe the guy in the
pink Speedo is this amazing.

37:16.534 --> 37:18.636
Like I'm actually
like on cloud nine.

37:18.703 --> 37:20.805
A best friend of mine
is getting married.

37:20.871 --> 37:24.041
- Will you be my plus one?
- What?!

37:24.108 --> 37:26.177
Vay and I are leaving Paradise.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.778
- What?
- Shut up.

37:27.845 --> 37:30.548
- She's coming to Alberta!
- No!

37:30.615 --> 37:35.653
I am 100% a forever
changed person.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.955
I found exactly what I was
always looking for.

37:38.022 --> 37:40.925
Guys, Paradise works.
It really does.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.227
That's a wrap on Joey.

37:43.294 --> 37:45.563
Where's my girl at?

37:46.797 --> 37:48.899
Yeehaw!

37:54.138 --> 37:57.174
So, everybody is
dying to know...

37:57.241 --> 38:00.544
How was your best
friend's wedding?

38:00.611 --> 38:03.214
Vay?

38:03.280 --> 38:05.583
Didn't make it there.

38:05.650 --> 38:08.619
And why didn't you end up
making it to the wedding?

38:08.686 --> 38:10.621
́Cause I got in my own head.

38:10.688 --> 38:13.624
It was a lot very,
very quickly.

38:13.691 --> 38:16.827
I kept trying to come up
with a million excuses

38:16.894 --> 38:18.763
why I should run away.

38:18.829 --> 38:22.099
And, it came down to a point
that I had to be honest with

38:22.166 --> 38:27.838
myself and just really
realize that I wasn't ready.

38:27.905 --> 38:30.541
So, I figured letting him go
would be better than

38:30.608 --> 38:33.978
dragging him along when I
was too much in my head.

38:34.045 --> 38:37.581
So, as far as the
wedding goes... sure.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.684
That part I can understand.

38:39.750 --> 38:42.153
What's the other part that
you can't understand?

38:42.219 --> 38:44.555
Literally everything that
happened after the wedding.

38:44.622 --> 38:45.956
What happened
after the wedding?

38:46.023 --> 38:48.893
You just off the blue
just tell me

38:48.959 --> 38:50.661
you want to move to Toronto.
-

38:50.728 --> 38:52.263
Everything was
very, very quick.

38:52.329 --> 38:55.599
I'm sorry, I told you I
wanted to move Toronto?

38:55.666 --> 38:56.534
- Don't...
- Yes.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.769
And you came literally
a few days later,

38:58.836 --> 39:01.939
and you came in my house.
And you expected to do that.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.941
And it was too fast.
I just told you

39:04.008 --> 39:05.743
it was too fast,
too quickly.

39:05.810 --> 39:07.211
And I got in my own head.

39:07.278 --> 39:10.281
I had just got out of something
months before that-

39:10.347 --> 39:11.349
Then say that.

39:11.415 --> 39:13.017
Don't tell someone you want
to spend the rest of

39:13.084 --> 39:15.286
your life with them on
a beach, on TV.

39:15.353 --> 39:19.023
I, I will admit, it's me.
I got in my own head.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.558
What else do you
want me to tell you?

39:20.624 --> 39:22.960
There's no excuse as to
why I did what I did.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.763
You can sit here and try to
find any excuse as to why

39:25.830 --> 39:27.998
I'm the villain, but these
are real feelings.

39:28.065 --> 39:29.967
I'm not looking for reasons
for you to be a villain, Vay.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.336
So, why haven't you talked
to me in months?

39:32.403 --> 39:34.672
- ́Cause I had no reason to.
- Okay.

39:34.739 --> 39:36.974
But you see me all the time,
but you can't even look at me.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.809
- No.
- But that was love, right?

39:38.876 --> 39:41.345
It was love until you did
everything you did to me.

39:41.412 --> 39:43.180
What did I do?

39:43.247 --> 39:47.718
I got here Saturday
night to see Vay.

39:47.785 --> 39:49.987
Now, mind you,
it was last minute.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.856
Did I expect to stay at your
place the whole time?

39:51.922 --> 39:53.758
No, I did not. I understand
you're a grown ass woman

39:53.824 --> 39:54.792
and you need
your own space.

39:54.859 --> 39:56.060
- Hence why I didn't-
- Did you not stay over?

39:56.127 --> 39:57.795
The first night,
and then I left!

39:57.862 --> 40:00.131
- Okay.
- That's Saturday night.

40:00.197 --> 40:04.034
By Wednesday, I catch you at a
bar in the arms of another guy.

40:04.101 --> 40:06.370
Yeah, do I get a chance to talk?
- Go ahead, love to hear it.

40:06.437 --> 40:08.773
First of all, that guy I was
sitting on his lap,

40:08.839 --> 40:10.241
was my good friend,
and you were standing

40:10.307 --> 40:11.876
at the corner staring at me.

40:11.942 --> 40:14.712
So, I guess I don't get
a chance to talk.

40:14.779 --> 40:15.946
Alright, so we'll
just leave it.

40:16.013 --> 40:17.848
It's the Joey show, that's fine.
I have nothing else to say.

40:17.915 --> 40:19.250
You can talk,
and every time you lie,

40:19.316 --> 40:20.317
I'll hit the
bullshit buzzer.

40:20.384 --> 40:21.318
I didn't lie, that guy
is a friend!

40:21.385 --> 40:23.621
Bullshit! Bullshit!

40:23.687 --> 40:25.389
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow, wow, Joey.

40:25.456 --> 40:27.024
You were avoiding me all night
and I found out which bar

40:27.091 --> 40:28.092
you were at ́cause of
your Instagram story.

40:28.192 --> 40:29.960
And I said, hey, let me go
surprise my girlfriend.

40:30.027 --> 40:33.297
So, I went there with my
buddy, I see you with this guy

40:33.364 --> 40:34.465
and his hand on your ass.

40:34.532 --> 40:35.432
And then you turn around, put
your around his head-

40:35.499 --> 40:38.903
Pardon? Bullshit button!
That's a lie.

40:38.969 --> 40:40.905
No, I'm not doing this.
I'll literally walk away.

40:40.971 --> 40:42.106
I'm not doing this.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.374
Well, walking away really
proves innocence, doesn't it?

40:43.440 --> 40:45.042
I don't need to
prove anything.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.644
These are my valid reasons.

40:46.710 --> 40:49.180
The true reason, everyone,
is because I wasn't ready.

40:49.246 --> 40:50.481
Okay, that's fair,
then say that.

40:50.548 --> 40:52.249
- Because should we all tell-
- I just finished saying that!

40:52.316 --> 40:53.484
No, prior, Vay.

40:53.551 --> 40:57.188
The real reason needed to come
much sooner than last week.

40:57.254 --> 40:59.223
A week before we were
gonna film this.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.825
I tried four, five times before.

41:00.891 --> 41:02.359
You tried- your timing is
worse than Chris'.

41:02.426 --> 41:04.862
I call you, you break up
with me ́cause you tell me

41:04.929 --> 41:07.798
I can't afford to provide you
with the type of lifestyle

41:07.865 --> 41:09.867
you've become accustomed to.

41:09.934 --> 41:13.070
That's pretty hard and fast
no for me.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.873
When you're sitting in the
hotel lobby I work in,

41:15.940 --> 41:17.341
you think it's a good idea
to be sitting there

41:17.408 --> 41:18.843
with your friends talking
shit about me?

41:18.909 --> 41:20.811
I know everything
you said that day.

41:20.878 --> 41:22.179
Your server was my friend.

41:22.246 --> 41:23.981
"I'm gonna say Joey had a
girlfriend the whole time.

41:24.048 --> 41:25.883
He's an actor and I'm gonna
say he was acting.

41:25.950 --> 41:28.352
By the way,
I think he's gay."

41:28.419 --> 41:29.954
Should we talk about
that whole one?

41:30.020 --> 41:32.456
Excuse me? I didn't accuse
you of being gay.

41:32.523 --> 41:34.225
You literally did in a message.

41:34.291 --> 41:36.060
- No, I didn't.
- I said I was straight.

41:36.126 --> 41:36.927
Do you want me to pull
out the message?

41:36.994 --> 41:40.064
- Sure.
- Oh, so you have your phone?

41:40.130 --> 41:42.333
No, I have the screenshots
of the text message

41:42.399 --> 41:44.235
you sent me Vay. Do I really
need to read the whole thing?

41:44.301 --> 41:45.469
- Oh, my God.
- So bad.

41:45.536 --> 41:47.238
I don't know if this
is necessary.

41:47.304 --> 41:48.439
No, it's not.

41:48.505 --> 41:50.774
And you all wonder why I don't
want to be with this man.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.376
- I'm done.
- You use that as an excuse now?

41:52.443 --> 41:55.346
I'm done, honestly, like,
what kind of person are you?

41:55.412 --> 41:57.915
How do you turn this back on me
after all the shit you've done?

41:57.982 --> 42:00.184
I literally told you why I
didn't want to be with you.

42:00.251 --> 42:01.218
No, you didn't, Vay!
I caught you with

42:01.285 --> 42:03.454
another guy and that
started the entire thing.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.123
You're literally trying to
tell the whole world

42:06.190 --> 42:07.992
I'm a horrible person,
I was with a guy.

42:08.058 --> 42:09.760
I'm not trying to tell them
you're a horrible person.

42:09.827 --> 42:11.996
I'm telling them the truth of
what you did and said to me.

42:12.062 --> 42:14.365
I actually do care about you!

42:14.431 --> 42:17.001
I panicked because
I'm in my own head.

42:17.067 --> 42:19.837
So, to sit here, like, if you
knew me on that beach,

42:19.904 --> 42:22.172
you knew those
feelings were real.

42:25.276 --> 42:30.014
Vay, Joey, any final words?

42:30.080 --> 42:32.883
I didn't handle the
situation properly.

42:32.950 --> 42:35.219
He deserves a girl
who's all in.

42:35.286 --> 42:39.957
He is an amazing guy and,
that's all I have to say.

42:40.024 --> 42:44.428
Vay, I'm sorry.
I just was very...

42:44.495 --> 42:46.797
very hurt by what I saw and

42:46.864 --> 42:50.067
the conversations that
proceeded that.

42:50.134 --> 42:53.370
But I did love you.

42:53.437 --> 42:56.473
Is there any way that you
will come back up and

42:56.540 --> 42:59.076
finish this off
in a warm way?

42:59.143 --> 43:01.745
A hug maybe?

43:05.849 --> 43:07.117
I'm sorry.

43:26.537 --> 43:29.340
Coming up, you favourite
bartender, Kevin Wendt,

43:29.406 --> 43:32.276
will join me onstage for an
exciting announcement

43:32.343 --> 43:35.279
that will set Bachelor
Nation on fire.

43:35.346 --> 43:37.982
But first, did Caitlin and
Kamil find their way

43:38.048 --> 43:39.984
back to each other
after Paradise?

43:40.050 --> 43:43.787
We'll find out when they join me
right here in the hot seat.

43:51.395 --> 43:53.163
Welcome back to the
season finale of

43:53.230 --> 43:55.199
Bachelor in Paradise Canada.

43:55.265 --> 43:57.501
While Caitlin and Kamil were
drawn to each other from

43:57.568 --> 44:02.072
the start, accusations of a
wandering eye and gaslighting,

44:02.139 --> 44:05.075
not to mention the failure
of other campers to,

44:05.142 --> 44:06.443
"stay in their own lane,"

44:06.510 --> 44:09.613
led to the explosive
end of their relationship.

44:09.680 --> 44:11.382
Let's take a look.

44:14.618 --> 44:16.320
I'm Kamil, nice to
meet you guys.

44:16.387 --> 44:18.155
I'm coming to Paradise for
the second time.

44:18.222 --> 44:21.158
Hopefully I don't
mess it up again.

44:21.225 --> 44:22.426
- Hey, you.
- What's up?

44:22.493 --> 44:23.560
- How are you?
- I'm good.

44:23.627 --> 44:26.463
That's Caitlin Clemmons.
You're the cute clementine.

44:26.530 --> 44:27.664
I feel like we have a
lot in common.

44:27.731 --> 44:31.301
She's like an equestrian.
I watch Heartland on Netflix.

44:33.670 --> 44:34.772
This is for everyone.

44:34.838 --> 44:38.008
Stay in your own lane and,
don't try to mess things up.

44:38.075 --> 44:40.377
I'm marking my territory.

44:40.444 --> 44:42.212
What's going on?

44:42.279 --> 44:45.215
- These are for you.
- Oh, thank you!

44:45.282 --> 44:47.618
I feel a little threatened
by another guy.

44:47.684 --> 44:50.254
One more time I hear
"Caitlin and Adam",

44:50.320 --> 44:53.390
I'm gonna explode.
He's like a wrecking ball.

44:53.457 --> 44:54.658
You're a rooster,
I'm a fucking gorilla.

44:54.725 --> 44:57.161
Like, sit your ass down.

44:57.227 --> 45:00.264
"Kamil, do you not realize
all the girls notice you

45:00.330 --> 45:03.634
checking them out,
or do you just not care?"

45:03.701 --> 45:09.440
There are a lot of things that
they're hiding from each other.

45:09.506 --> 45:12.176
Clearly, something's like
missing here.

45:12.242 --> 45:13.677
I'm just gonna be
straight up with you.

45:13.744 --> 45:15.446
I want to take
you on a date.

45:15.512 --> 45:16.980
Um...

45:17.047 --> 45:18.615
Everyone just keeps
coming at us, huh?

45:18.682 --> 45:21.485
I think both Kamil and I have
a target on our back.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.087
We can just leave
right now and

45:23.153 --> 45:24.321
work things out in
the real world.

45:24.388 --> 45:29.193
It just doesn't seem like I'm,
I'm really part of the plan.

45:29.259 --> 45:31.462
We've been having
communication issues.

45:31.528 --> 45:33.497
I just want somebody to be
there for me because

45:33.564 --> 45:35.399
I'm not really feeling
that right now.

45:35.466 --> 45:37.401
He's gaslighting
me again.

45:37.468 --> 45:39.703
I need someone who's
going to be okay

45:39.770 --> 45:41.939
with me disagreeing
with them.

45:42.005 --> 45:46.076
Right now, you're being a
totally different person.

45:46.143 --> 45:49.346
I'm having flashbacks to my
bad time in Paradise,

45:49.413 --> 45:51.215
and the whole
world hated me.

45:51.281 --> 45:54.318
I'm heart broken,
honestly.

45:54.384 --> 45:57.121
This is not how I wanted
all of this to end.

45:57.187 --> 46:00.624
What we have in Paradise,
what we had as a couple,

46:00.691 --> 46:03.160
I'm gonna try
to get it back.

46:07.664 --> 46:09.600
That was a tough break up.

46:09.666 --> 46:11.568
How did it feel
watching it back?

46:11.635 --> 46:12.736
It's hard seeing the ending.

46:12.803 --> 46:15.672
I feel like our relationship
was tested the most out of

46:15.739 --> 46:20.310
anyone here in Paradise, like,
I had Chris coming after me.

46:20.377 --> 46:22.479
Then I had Adam,
then I had Mike.

46:22.546 --> 46:24.481
That was a lot to handle.

46:24.548 --> 46:25.549
Caitlin, what about you?

46:25.616 --> 46:30.087
I struggled to watch that last
episode because...

46:30.154 --> 46:35.592
it seemed like the one time I
stood up for myself...

46:35.659 --> 46:39.096
I like somehow got it turned
back on me and, you know,

46:39.163 --> 46:43.467
I went back to me being some
sort of passive woman.

46:43.534 --> 46:45.402
That's not who I am
in real life.

46:45.469 --> 46:49.540
Like, I'm a strong
like well spoken,

46:49.606 --> 46:52.376
independent woman and...

46:52.442 --> 46:54.745
I think I kind of lost myself.

46:54.811 --> 46:56.513
Going into fantasy suites,

46:56.580 --> 46:59.082
you two seemed to be in a
really great place.

46:59.149 --> 47:00.350
What went wrong?

47:00.417 --> 47:02.386
I just felt I was
not ready for

47:02.452 --> 47:05.589
all those questions at that
given time. I felt like we had-

47:05.656 --> 47:07.791
But did you find the questions
were really that challenging?

47:07.858 --> 47:10.093
Like, it was just
very basic stuff.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.094
They weren't challenging,

47:11.161 --> 47:13.130
but it kept on going,
and going, and going.

47:13.197 --> 47:14.631
And I couldn't even really
ask you anything

47:14.698 --> 47:16.567
because it was just...
constantly-

47:16.633 --> 47:18.202
That's so not true.

47:18.268 --> 47:20.204
Well, that's,
that's how I felt, Caitlin.

47:20.270 --> 47:21.238
That's why I walked away.

47:21.305 --> 47:23.507
And in fact, all of them saw
there were moments

47:23.574 --> 47:26.243
where I said,
"Help me understand".

47:26.310 --> 47:27.578
And I couldn't
understand either.

47:27.644 --> 47:29.479
How could I have been
better in that situation?

47:29.546 --> 47:33.517
But Caitlin, I'm not gonna
argue about this right now.

47:33.584 --> 47:35.586
What has happened
since Paradise and

47:35.652 --> 47:38.722
where do you
two stand today?

47:38.789 --> 47:41.225
I ended up going to New York.

47:41.291 --> 47:44.828
I put in all the effort that I
could and, unfortunately,

47:44.895 --> 47:47.331
it wasn't reciprocated so...

47:47.397 --> 47:49.800
yeah, things are
very much done.

47:49.867 --> 47:55.205
Who officially ended things,
and how did that happen?

47:55.272 --> 48:01.478
I got a text message from
Kamil, ending things, so...

48:01.545 --> 48:04.548
Yeah, I mean, I did
text her what I felt,

48:04.615 --> 48:09.720
but I know Caitlin's a, more
about the phone and I usually-

48:09.786 --> 48:12.356
It's not a matter of me
being about the phone

48:12.422 --> 48:14.291
it's just a level of
respect, Kamil.

48:14.358 --> 48:16.793
Like, when you're gonna do
something like that to somebody.

48:16.860 --> 48:17.928
That's the way I just...

48:17.995 --> 48:21.131
It just seems really cowardly.
Like, really cowardly.

48:21.198 --> 48:23.333
It's not cowardly. That's
the way I process things

48:23.400 --> 48:26.336
and that's the way I, I get
my thoughts on paper.

48:26.403 --> 48:28.272
And, I took time
to write that.

48:28.338 --> 48:31.642
I'm so glad you were able to get
all your thoughts out on text.

48:31.708 --> 48:34.544
- I mean, okay.
- Okay.

48:34.611 --> 48:37.147
The term 'gaslighting'
came up many times.

48:37.214 --> 48:39.683
I just want to ask the group,
how many of you felt

48:39.750 --> 48:45.122
that Kamil was
gaslighting Caitlin?

48:45.188 --> 48:48.659
Caitlin tried to communicate
with him, in his own language,

48:48.725 --> 48:50.527
some way that he
would understand.

48:50.594 --> 48:53.130
But it still just never
got through.

48:53.196 --> 48:54.765
And she ended up being
the one that was

48:54.831 --> 48:57.267
sort of blamed for it all.

48:57.334 --> 48:59.836
A part of this that's
frustrating to me though is,

48:59.903 --> 49:01.738
okay, so communication
styles are different,

49:01.805 --> 49:06.376
but you can still be a good guy
and a stand-up guy, and like...

49:06.443 --> 49:08.278
I just feel like there were
moments where

49:08.345 --> 49:09.880
you really lacked
as a partner.

49:09.947 --> 49:12.649
And like, to constantly be
giving you an out because of

49:12.716 --> 49:15.452
communication, like,
it doesn't seem fair to me

49:15.519 --> 49:18.622
when I gave it
my all.

49:18.689 --> 49:21.758
Angela, you were in Paradise
with Kamil previously.

49:21.825 --> 49:22.626
Mhm.

49:22.693 --> 49:24.861
And things didn't
end well for him.

49:24.928 --> 49:27.698
Were you surprised
to see how things

49:27.764 --> 49:30.400
ended here with,
with Caitlin?

49:30.467 --> 49:33.203
I don't think that
he's right for her,

49:33.270 --> 49:34.271
or they're right
for each other.

49:34.338 --> 49:38.175
You deserve more effort than
you were putting in.

49:38.241 --> 49:40.844
Kamil, do you,
do you regret the

49:40.911 --> 49:43.313
"stay in your own lane"
comment?

49:43.380 --> 49:46.283
Hey, I said it and...

49:46.350 --> 49:49.753
yeah, not a lot of people
took it to heart, right?

49:49.820 --> 49:51.455
I found it a little strange
Kamil said that when the

49:51.521 --> 49:53.457
day before he was sitting at
the bar telling Vay that

49:53.523 --> 49:56.793
she shouldn't be with me.
It seemed a little bit...

49:56.860 --> 49:58.462
Yeah, the timing
was kind of off.

49:58.528 --> 49:59.830
Yeah, a little bit.

49:59.896 --> 50:01.498
So, we can work
on your delivery.

50:01.565 --> 50:03.367
We saw the talent show, yeah.

50:03.433 --> 50:06.837
There was a statement that
Kamil made, basically saying,

50:06.903 --> 50:09.473
"You should have asked me
if Illeana was free,"

50:09.539 --> 50:14.711
and I don't think any man
has any control over

50:14.778 --> 50:16.513
any other woman
on that beach.

50:16.580 --> 50:19.483
I think the point Kamil was
trying to make was that, hey,

50:19.549 --> 50:21.385
like if you want to get a little
bit of the lay of the land

50:21.451 --> 50:22.686
and sort of find out maybe

50:22.753 --> 50:24.821
who's more available
to take out.

50:24.888 --> 50:26.523
I still think that's a
ridiculous statement though.

50:26.590 --> 50:28.759
- ́Cause it is ultimately-
- Yeah, I fully agree.

50:28.825 --> 50:30.527
...every woman's choice
what they want to do.

50:30.594 --> 50:32.262
And how'd that
work out for you?

50:32.329 --> 50:34.531
Obviously, it didn't
work out, but-

50:34.598 --> 50:36.466
And how'd it work out
for you too, bud?

50:36.533 --> 50:39.403
And did you explore your,
your opportunities and

50:39.469 --> 50:41.238
your options as well?
I think you did.

50:41.304 --> 50:43.573
So, so for you to even say that,
it's kind of backhanded.

50:43.640 --> 50:44.775
It makes no sense.

50:44.841 --> 50:49.980
Joey, you, you had written the
infamous bonfire question

50:50.047 --> 50:51.815
about the wandering eye.

50:53.417 --> 50:54.484
Oh, gotcha, that one, yeah.

50:54.551 --> 50:57.320
There were just a couple
comments of girls that noticed

50:57.387 --> 51:01.425
Kamil had been doing the 1-2
up and down on them so...

51:01.491 --> 51:02.759
Is, is that true?

51:02.826 --> 51:06.496
I mean, yeah.
I did do that, yes.

51:06.563 --> 51:09.433
We were at a beach so,
if anyone doesn't look at

51:09.499 --> 51:11.468
each other and checks them
out then, I don't know,

51:11.535 --> 51:14.671
you're in the wrong place,
I guess.

51:14.738 --> 51:18.542
And you just said the exact same
thing again that you said...

51:18.608 --> 51:20.510
you regretted saying while
you were on the show,

51:20.577 --> 51:23.814
so it's like, wow.

51:23.880 --> 51:27.851
Caitlin and Kamil, is there
any chance at

51:27.918 --> 51:31.488
a relationship between
the two of you?

51:31.555 --> 51:35.859
No. No, we're done.

51:35.926 --> 51:37.694
- Yeah, I would say the same.
- Yeah.

51:39.629 --> 51:42.032
Coming up, they were the first
campers on the beach and

51:42.099 --> 51:43.934
the golden couple
of Paradise.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.769
How did they go from
"I love you"

51:45.836 --> 51:48.538
to heartbreak and tears?
Stay tuned.

51:57.581 --> 52:00.050
Brendan and Illeana were
the first on the beach.

52:00.117 --> 52:02.652
But sadly, not the last.

52:02.719 --> 52:06.623
How did the ultimate summer
camp romance go so wrong?

52:06.690 --> 52:10.727
Let's take a look.

52:10.794 --> 52:13.096
- Hello!
- I'm Brendan.

52:13.163 --> 52:14.464
I'm Illeana.
It's nice to meet you.

52:14.531 --> 52:15.565
Pleasure, pleasure
to meet you.

52:15.632 --> 52:16.800
It's strange.

52:16.867 --> 52:20.670
You don't expect to like make
a connection the first day.

52:20.737 --> 52:22.706
It's been a long time since like
I've connected with someone.

52:22.772 --> 52:24.374
You're so beautiful.

52:26.109 --> 52:28.111
I'm here to meet my husband.

52:28.178 --> 52:30.981
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, my goodness.

52:31.047 --> 52:32.883
I just feel really
comfortable with you.

52:32.949 --> 52:35.619
Like, it feels...
effortless.

52:35.685 --> 52:38.822
All I want to do is go hang out
on the beach with Illeana.

52:38.889 --> 52:40.824
Am I the luckiest girl
in Paradise?

52:40.891 --> 52:42.392
I have tunnel vision
at this point.

52:42.459 --> 52:45.896
But, it's Paradise,
anything could happen.

52:45.962 --> 52:46.997
We're heading out
for a date so,

52:47.063 --> 52:48.899
we'll see you later tonight,
okay?

52:48.965 --> 52:51.635
What would you do if Illeana
found a connection

52:51.701 --> 52:53.703
with somebody else?

52:53.770 --> 52:57.674
- The kiss was really good.
- Fire?

52:57.741 --> 53:00.644
I don't want you rolling around
in the sand, kissing someone.

53:00.710 --> 53:04.514
If Illeana doesn't choose me,
I'm just gonna leave.

53:04.581 --> 53:07.951
Someone gets hurt. It's just
like, who is that person?

53:10.921 --> 53:15.525
I was just thinking about
coming back and being with you.

53:15.592 --> 53:18.461
It's like 200 pounds like
lifted off my chest.

53:18.528 --> 53:20.397
Everything's lining up
perfectly for us.

53:20.463 --> 53:22.566
Brendan, will you
accept this rose?

53:22.632 --> 53:24.034
Of course.

53:24.100 --> 53:25.769
Illeana, will you
accept this rose?

53:25.835 --> 53:28.071
100,000%.

53:28.138 --> 53:29.873
It could end with that
engagement.

53:29.940 --> 53:31.474
I love you.

53:31.541 --> 53:33.777
I love you too.

53:33.843 --> 53:38.048
This made me realize, like,
wow, this is getting very real.

53:38.114 --> 53:39.983
- You nervous?
- What?

53:40.050 --> 53:42.185
Engagement.

53:42.252 --> 53:43.219
If I didn't have a say in it,

53:43.286 --> 53:45.689
he would just run straight
into an engagement.

53:45.755 --> 53:48.058
And I'm just wondering
how this translates

53:48.124 --> 53:50.927
into the outside world.

53:50.994 --> 53:52.596
I mean, we're always
on the same page.

53:52.662 --> 53:53.863
I want to walk out
of here with you.

53:53.930 --> 53:55.065
I don't think
that he gets it.

53:55.131 --> 53:59.202
I fell in love with you the way
a teenager falls in love.

53:59.269 --> 54:02.906
I'm not ready for this type
of commitment.

54:02.973 --> 54:04.975
I just am.

54:05.041 --> 54:06.943
I'm just scared.

54:11.848 --> 54:16.019
- I'm just not ready.
- I know, I know.

54:16.086 --> 54:18.521
I have to walk away.

54:22.592 --> 54:25.662
How did it feel watching
that all over again?

54:25.729 --> 54:28.164
From day one, I was
obviously very grateful

54:28.231 --> 54:29.766
to be the first
on the beach.

54:29.833 --> 54:33.603
Having Illeana be the second
person on the beach.

54:33.670 --> 54:35.472
You know, I lucked out and,

54:35.538 --> 54:36.873
I haven't found a
connection with someone

54:36.940 --> 54:39.509
like I did with Illeana in,
in a very long time.

54:39.576 --> 54:41.544
I have nothing but
love for, for Illy.

54:41.611 --> 54:43.146
Brendan, you know,
in Paradise,

54:43.213 --> 54:45.982
you always seemed to
agree with Illeana.

54:46.049 --> 54:48.551
- Right.
- Right?

54:48.618 --> 54:51.721
Were you holding back at all,
in any way?

54:51.788 --> 54:52.989
Looking back, like,

54:53.056 --> 54:56.092
am I a different person
outside of Paradise?

54:56.159 --> 54:59.095
Yes, ́cause, you know,
there's little things that I,

54:59.162 --> 55:01.598
I would tell her if she's
wrong and vice versa.

55:01.665 --> 55:05.568
I definitely need a partner
who tells me when I'm wrong

55:05.635 --> 55:07.570
and has, you know,

55:07.637 --> 55:09.539
strong opinions about
things that might be

55:09.606 --> 55:10.607
different than my own.

55:10.674 --> 55:11.708
Maybe I agreed with
everything because I didn't

55:11.808 --> 55:14.177
want to it up, but it
was Paradise, you know,

55:14.244 --> 55:15.979
and it's hard to get that
out of someone

55:16.046 --> 55:17.781
there in that scenario.

55:17.847 --> 55:21.985
Illeana, what were you
looking for from Brendan

55:22.052 --> 55:24.654
that he wasn't giving you?

55:24.721 --> 55:28.558
I mean, I was looking for love,
and I found love.

55:28.625 --> 55:31.995
I think, at the end of the day,
the reason that we're not

55:32.062 --> 55:35.598
together has nothing really
to do with who Brendan is

55:35.665 --> 55:37.934
as a person, and more to
do with the fact that

55:38.001 --> 55:41.771
I wasn't ready for a
committed relationship.

55:41.838 --> 55:45.642
There were so many layers that
Brendan I still to this day

55:45.709 --> 55:50.246
need to unfold and, and dig a
little deeper with each other.

55:50.313 --> 55:52.949
I knew, had we left
in a relationship,

55:53.016 --> 55:54.751
like it wouldn't
have worked.

55:54.818 --> 55:58.588
Joey, you had
accused Brendan S.

55:58.655 --> 56:01.257
of following Illeana around
like a puppy dog.

56:01.324 --> 56:04.260
I just think I was saying what
a lot of us saw on the beach,

56:04.327 --> 56:05.762
up to that point.

56:05.829 --> 56:08.231
It just seemed like
Brendan had blinders.

56:08.298 --> 56:10.100
It's fine, I know I didn't,
I didn't talk to you boys.

56:10.166 --> 56:11.835
I didn't hang out
all the time, but...

56:11.901 --> 56:14.104
I went in doing what
I wanted to do.

56:14.170 --> 56:16.906
If I stay in a committed
relationship, people talk shit.

56:16.973 --> 56:20.076
If I go and kiss another
girl and another girl,

56:20.143 --> 56:21.578
then I'm a player.
You can't,

56:21.644 --> 56:22.412
you can't win
in Paradise and

56:22.479 --> 56:23.780
you gotta do what
makes you happy.

56:23.847 --> 56:24.948
If there's one thing
to say about you,

56:25.014 --> 56:27.751
you definitely said you were
gonna do what you did and,

56:27.817 --> 56:28.752
sure as hell, you did it.

56:28.818 --> 56:32.088
Appreciate it.

56:32.155 --> 56:35.692
So, where does the
relationship stand today?

56:36.860 --> 56:39.796
I'm always gonna have
unconditional love for you.

56:39.863 --> 56:43.299
And, it's not like the
chapter's closed, I feel like,

56:43.366 --> 56:46.202
but that's, that's me.
That's me, but...

56:46.269 --> 56:47.370
No, I completely agree.

56:47.437 --> 56:49.105
I mean, we both have
love for each other.

56:49.172 --> 56:50.807
It just wasn't our time.

56:50.874 --> 56:52.942
But hey, it could be
in the future.

56:53.009 --> 56:57.213
Brendan S., Illeana, thank you
very much for joining us.

56:57.280 --> 56:58.848
- Thank you, Jesse.
- Thanks, Jesse.

56:58.915 --> 57:02.051
There's only one couple that
left Paradise hand in hand.

57:02.118 --> 57:05.755
And things have changed in a
big way for them since Paradise.

57:05.822 --> 57:07.657
But before we find out more,

57:07.724 --> 57:12.729
let's take a look back
at their journey.

57:12.796 --> 57:14.264
Hey, guys!

57:14.330 --> 57:16.399
Angela, she was
on my season.

57:16.466 --> 57:19.269
Paradise has always been a
little bit tough for me.

57:23.840 --> 57:26.910
But, maybe third
time's a charm.

57:28.244 --> 57:30.113
- Okay!
- Alright.

57:30.180 --> 57:34.384
I'm excited to explore the
Brendan M. avenue.

57:34.451 --> 57:38.054
Angela, she has that potential
to be, you know, wifey material.

57:38.121 --> 57:40.423
It's been a minute since
I felt butterflies.

57:48.064 --> 57:51.334
I'm about to like scream.

57:51.401 --> 57:53.436
We're in Paradise.
You have to explore to

57:53.503 --> 57:56.005
make sure that we can
find the right one.

57:56.072 --> 57:58.374
Angela, I was gonna see if you
wanna, you wanna bounce?

57:58.441 --> 58:01.377
- I'd love that.
- Have fun!

58:01.444 --> 58:05.248
I wasn't expecting to be
attracted to the new guy.

58:05.315 --> 58:07.283
Whoo!

58:07.350 --> 58:10.153
I do not envy you,
my good man.

58:10.220 --> 58:12.222
- Hey, Brendan.
- Hey, what's up?

58:12.288 --> 58:13.456
Would you like to go
on a date with me?

58:13.523 --> 58:15.024
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

58:15.091 --> 58:16.259
Okay.

58:16.326 --> 58:17.460
Like that, you know?

58:17.527 --> 58:20.096
When they say it's too good
to be true, it normally is.

58:22.298 --> 58:25.201
Today has helped me realize
how much I actually like you.

58:25.268 --> 58:27.837
Oh, oh.

58:27.904 --> 58:31.708
To moving forward and leaving
the past in the past.

58:31.774 --> 58:35.111
We have had more than
one obstacle and,

58:35.178 --> 58:37.814
every single time, we always
just fight through it.

58:37.881 --> 58:39.816
Each day, we get stronger.

58:39.883 --> 58:42.385
I feel really confident in where
Brendan M. and I are.

58:42.452 --> 58:45.355
I genuinely feel as though I'm
falling in love with you.

58:45.421 --> 58:46.856
I'm falling in love
with you too.

58:46.923 --> 58:48.791
Have been for a minute.

58:48.858 --> 58:51.427
I feel like I'm ready to go
out into the real world and

58:51.494 --> 58:54.330
I'm excited to be
a team with you.

58:59.202 --> 59:02.272
When we return, Brendan M. and
Angela will take the stage

59:02.338 --> 59:05.008
to reveal some big
relationship updates.

59:05.074 --> 59:07.043
And, a major
announcement from

59:07.110 --> 59:09.746
our Paradise bartender
Kevin Wendt.

59:09.812 --> 59:11.180
All of this, when the

59:11.247 --> 59:14.150
Bachelor in Paradise
Canada finale continues.

59:22.158 --> 59:25.094
Angela, Brendan M.,
great to see you both.

59:25.161 --> 59:26.763
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

59:26.829 --> 59:29.999
So, how did it feel to see
your love story unfold?

59:30.066 --> 59:31.334
It was great.

59:31.401 --> 59:34.003
I just think everything kind of
came full circle.

59:34.070 --> 59:36.940
And, it was...

59:37.006 --> 59:39.542
I don't know, it gives you the
feels all over again.

59:39.609 --> 59:41.344
Yeah, I agree.

59:41.411 --> 59:44.981
Obviously, we didn't have the,
I guess, smoothest journey,

59:45.048 --> 59:48.384
but you know, in the end, we
left Paradise together and

59:48.451 --> 59:51.487
that's ultimately what we
came here for, so...

59:51.554 --> 59:54.791
Brendan, as a newbie to
the Bachelor scene,

59:54.857 --> 59:56.826
what was the hardest part
of your journey?

59:56.893 --> 59:59.963
I guess being able to explore
different relationships,

1:00:00.029 --> 1:00:02.498
but at the same time, not
making it come off as though

1:00:02.565 --> 1:00:04.500
I wasn't there for
the right reasons.

1:00:04.567 --> 1:00:06.836
In the end, you know,
I was genuinely here

1:00:06.903 --> 1:00:09.238
for a connection,
and I left with that.

1:00:09.305 --> 1:00:10.807
Give us an update.

1:00:10.873 --> 1:00:13.443
Okay, what's, what's the
latest in your relationship?

1:00:13.509 --> 1:00:14.277
Do you want to?

1:00:14.344 --> 1:00:16.412
You can give him
an update, go ahead.

1:00:16.479 --> 1:00:17.814
Yeah, so, ah...

1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:20.516
- Ange is pregnant.
- Oh, my god, Brendan!

1:00:20.583 --> 1:00:23.486
-
- No, no, no!

1:00:23.553 --> 1:00:25.021
Oh, no, we're not?
Oh, oh.

1:00:26.222 --> 1:00:27.290
I thought Ange was
pregnant, okay.

1:00:27.357 --> 1:00:28.925
You're not pregnant?
Okay, my bad.

1:00:28.992 --> 1:00:30.259
- He's cruel.
- So, so no?

1:00:30.326 --> 1:00:31.928
No, oh, my God!

1:00:31.995 --> 1:00:34.931
Not everybody understands
Brendan's sense of humour.

1:00:36.599 --> 1:00:38.835
So, there is no,
there is no baby?

1:00:38.901 --> 1:00:40.370
- No!
- Okay, so, there's no baby.

1:00:40.436 --> 1:00:42.338
We've established that
there's no baby.

1:00:42.405 --> 1:00:44.440
You're terrible!

1:00:44.507 --> 1:00:50.213
The actual update is,
I am here in Toronto and...

1:00:50.279 --> 1:00:52.915
Brendan also moved to Toronto.

1:00:52.982 --> 1:00:57.420
And, we signed a lease
together, so...

1:00:57.487 --> 1:00:59.856
we are making it work
in the real world.

1:01:01.591 --> 1:01:04.093
I like that, I like that.

1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:08.431
We wish you luck and, thank you
so much for being here.

1:01:08.498 --> 1:01:12.568
In Paradise, things get heated,
and emotions run high.

1:01:12.635 --> 1:01:15.204
But things aren't
always so serious.

1:01:15.271 --> 1:01:20.043
Let's take a look at the
lighter side of Camp Paradise.

1:01:22.311 --> 1:01:25.014
- Alright, thanks.
- Agh!

1:01:25.081 --> 1:01:26.616
- Yes.
- Gah!

1:01:26.682 --> 1:01:28.317
Went right through to
the other side, okay.

1:01:28.384 --> 1:01:29.952
That's an old man joke,
let's do it.

1:01:30.019 --> 1:01:31.587
This is his night club moves.

1:01:31.654 --> 1:01:33.222
Now I know.
Now I know.

1:01:33.289 --> 1:01:35.158
- Gotta try.
- How we doing?

1:01:35.224 --> 1:01:36.559
You got the Oreo
going on now though.

1:01:36.626 --> 1:01:38.094
Agh!

1:01:40.396 --> 1:01:42.031
- Ooh...
- Ah!

1:01:48.204 --> 1:01:51.140
Hold on, hold on, you have to
lean forward, alright.

1:01:51.207 --> 1:01:53.342
- Wait!
-

1:01:53.409 --> 1:01:54.911
The bugs are bad.

1:01:58.181 --> 1:02:00.016
Ninja move.

1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:05.922
But, you know, it was...

1:02:09.525 --> 1:02:11.694
Oh, did you see,
see that bug!

1:02:13.696 --> 1:02:18.167
What, where? Where?
Not near me.

1:02:18.234 --> 1:02:20.470
bugs on my face.

1:02:24.006 --> 1:02:26.275
Am I 100% Alberta beef?

1:02:26.342 --> 1:02:28.544
Yes, yes, the- yes,

1:02:28.611 --> 1:02:32.615
I am 100% Alberta-
that's the answer there.

1:02:35.251 --> 1:02:36.519
Yeah, a lot of couples have
been using the sauna

1:02:36.586 --> 1:02:40.223
as some sort
of erotic... dungeon.

1:02:41.757 --> 1:02:43.693
- Good for you, bad boy.
-

1:02:49.499 --> 1:02:52.101
Yeah, we, we found it.
It was in here.

1:02:52.168 --> 1:02:55.037
I would love to have a
sauna date and just get

1:02:55.104 --> 1:02:58.174
hot and heavy with
someone and just, agh!

1:02:58.241 --> 1:02:59.542
I want to ravish your body.

1:02:59.609 --> 1:03:02.745
Ah, PG!
That's PG for me.

1:03:06.315 --> 1:03:07.984
Sorry.

1:03:08.050 --> 1:03:10.153
What does everybody know
about the sauna?

1:03:18.127 --> 1:03:21.197
Nobody's supposed to
know about the sauna!

1:03:21.264 --> 1:03:23.132
For the sake of the
cameraman that

1:03:23.199 --> 1:03:24.534
has been staring at
this cabana...

1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:25.635
Oh!

1:03:25.701 --> 1:03:28.271
Oh, my God, y'all.

1:03:28.337 --> 1:03:31.674
I'm sorry, again.
I don't want to-

1:03:31.741 --> 1:03:33.776
- Yo, what the...!
- So, anyways, like-

1:03:33.843 --> 1:03:35.211
Brendan!

1:03:35.278 --> 1:03:38.114
I'm dying,
I'm dying.

1:03:38.181 --> 1:03:40.116
Um...

1:03:42.418 --> 1:03:46.189
He's a Paradise success story
and everyone's favourite

1:03:46.255 --> 1:03:49.091
bartender, Kevin.
Thanks for joining us, man.

1:03:49.158 --> 1:03:51.127
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

1:03:51.194 --> 1:03:52.528
- Guys.
- Hey, Kev!

1:03:52.595 --> 1:03:54.463
What's going on?
I feel like I missed a lot.

1:03:55.798 --> 1:03:59.202
What was it like being on the
other side, here in Paradise?

1:03:59.268 --> 1:04:02.305
Well, it was, it was tough
because I was on the other side

1:04:02.371 --> 1:04:04.073
actually watching the
whole thing unfold,

1:04:04.140 --> 1:04:05.341
which I've never
done before.

1:04:05.408 --> 1:04:07.376
I wanted everyone to really get
the full experience out of it

1:04:07.443 --> 1:04:08.611
so, it was a, it was a
tough balance.

1:04:08.678 --> 1:04:10.646
I'm learning as I go.

1:04:10.713 --> 1:04:12.815
But I feel like you guys
were a lot of fun,

1:04:12.882 --> 1:04:14.483
and you guys definitely put
yourself out there

1:04:14.550 --> 1:04:15.551
the way you're supposed to.

1:04:15.651 --> 1:04:17.587
What advice would you give
to someone who wants to

1:04:17.653 --> 1:04:19.388
eventually hit the beach?

1:04:19.455 --> 1:04:21.123
I feel like if you're
interested, you gotta be open.

1:04:21.190 --> 1:04:22.391
I know a lot of
people here were.

1:04:22.458 --> 1:04:24.060
You guys did a great season
because of that.

1:04:24.126 --> 1:04:26.429
And anyone's that ever looking
to do something like this,

1:04:26.495 --> 1:04:28.497
I feel like that's what you
have to follow is,

1:04:28.564 --> 1:04:30.600
open for absolutely anything.

1:04:30.666 --> 1:04:33.336
Speaking of which, we have
a little bit of news

1:04:33.402 --> 1:04:35.338
to share with Bachelor
Nation tonight.

1:04:35.404 --> 1:04:38.407
That's right, Jesse.
Bachelor Nation, get ready.

1:04:38.474 --> 1:04:40.509
Because Canadian Paradise
is here to stay.

1:04:40.576 --> 1:04:43.179
Casting for the next season of
Bachelor in Paradise Canada

1:04:43.246 --> 1:04:44.413
is officially open.

1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:45.715
And we're looking for
fresh faces from

1:04:50.920 --> 1:04:53.856

1:04:53.923 --> 1:04:56.792
Bachelor Nation,
this is your chance,

1:04:56.859 --> 1:04:58.661

change your life forever.

1:05:02.698 --> 1:05:05.401
And with that, I'd like to
thank you, Kevin,

1:05:05.468 --> 1:05:09.472
and our campers, for opening up
your hearts to us this season.

1:05:09.538 --> 1:05:11.507
And thanks to you,
Bachelor Nation.

1:05:11.574 --> 1:05:14.543
There would be no
Paradise without you.

1:05:14.610 --> 1:05:17.513
Until next time, Canada.
Good night, everyone.

1:05:19.582 --> 1:05:21.617
Good night it is.

1:05:41.470 --> 1:05:44.140
Ah, do we get to hug finally?

1:05:44.206 --> 1:05:45.841
- Congrats.
- Wow, wow.

1:05:45.908 --> 1:05:48.511
- Congrats.
- Of course, thanks.

1:05:48.577 --> 1:05:50.313
