WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.200
<i>Previously on Greek:</i>

00:01.300 --> 00:04.500
I know who started the fire.
I did. But it was an accident.

00:04.510 --> 00:07.800
- Maybe someday you'll forgive me.
- For burning down my house?

00:07.810 --> 00:09.337
The all-Greek softbalt
tournament is this weekend

00:09.371 --> 00:11.072
Since we're partnering
with a fraternity,

00:11.106 --> 00:13.508
I'm ready to meet a fun new guy.

00:13.542 --> 00:16.444
- Who is the lucky girl?
- Uh, Rebecca.

00:16.478 --> 00:20.281
We can go for a coffee
or a movie or something simple.

00:20.315 --> 00:23.851
Who knows, maybe after coffee
it'll be love at first sight.

00:23.886 --> 00:26.921
You're Casey Cartwright.
You can do anything you want.

00:26.955 --> 00:29.690
That's how I know you're gonna
go to Washington and be amazing.

00:29.725 --> 00:30.958
- What about...
- Graduation?

00:30.993 --> 00:32.426
You'll never leave here.

00:32.461 --> 00:35.663
I don't think I can be anywhere
that didn't have you.

00:40.502 --> 00:42.803
So how did we get here,
my peeps?

00:42.838 --> 00:45.172
How did
Saint Valentine's beheading

00:45.207 --> 00:47.441
lead to some whacked
holiday about love?

00:47.476 --> 00:48.743
A-How.

00:50.646 --> 00:51.646
Chaucer.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.248
- Joshuurr?
- For reals.

00:54.283 --> 00:55.983
According to Chaucer,

00:56.018 --> 00:59.520
Valentine wrote a love-letter,
signed "From your Valentine,"

00:59.555 --> 01:01.422
that the greeting card
companies have turned into

01:01.456 --> 01:03.791
a billion-dollar-a-year
industry.

01:03.825 --> 01:05.426
Cards for grandpas,

01:05.459 --> 01:09.931
for dogs, there are even cards
for people who don't buy cards.

01:09.965 --> 01:13.301
Probably because
they're too cheap.

01:13.335 --> 01:16.804
David... But I digress.
We'll pick this up next week.

01:16.838 --> 01:18.539
Don't believe the hype.

01:20.642 --> 01:23.477
Professor Clarissa sure
has it in for Valentine's Day.

01:23.512 --> 01:25.146
Why can't she celebrate
with her friends?

01:25.180 --> 01:26.581
That's what
I'm gonna do.

01:26.615 --> 01:29.250
- How do you know her fries?
- I mean my friends.

01:29.284 --> 01:30.751
It's still
a great holiday

01:30.786 --> 01:33.187
even though I've never
actually celebrated with a girl

01:33.221 --> 01:36.691
- besides my mom.
- Well, that's the spirit.

01:36.725 --> 01:38.859
So who's the lucky...

01:38.894 --> 01:40.962
...friends. Your brothers?

01:40.996 --> 01:44.332
No, they all have dates to our
"Shot through the heart" party.

01:44.366 --> 01:45.533
Mmm...

01:45.567 --> 01:49.103
And Calvin has Grant.
Cappie and Casey.

01:49.137 --> 01:50.871
- Dale?
- No.

01:50.906 --> 01:52.506
He's taking
that retainer girl

01:52.541 --> 01:54.642
to a party his church
is hosting.

01:54.676 --> 01:58.379
The theme is "Celibate
good times, c'mon".

01:58.413 --> 02:01.315
- Which leaves me one friend...
- Oh, thank God.

02:01.350 --> 02:05.353
'Cause being alone on
Valentine's Day would suck.

02:06.655 --> 02:07.955
Oh. Um...

02:07.990 --> 02:09.457
I am going

02:09.491 --> 02:12.660
to the Omega Chi Date Dance
with this guy, Pete.

02:12.694 --> 02:14.929
We've only been dating,
like, two weeks, but,

02:14.963 --> 02:18.099
he hasn't shown any
Fisher-like behavior, so...

02:18.133 --> 02:19.600
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

02:19.635 --> 02:22.403
Because this year, no
matter what anyone says,

02:22.437 --> 02:24.572
I'm going to have the best
Valen-time ever.

02:28.210 --> 02:29.543
Wow!

02:29.578 --> 02:30.845
Nice.

02:30.879 --> 02:33.547
The Cupid Range is
a good start, pledges,

02:33.582 --> 02:35.416
but I want to see a lot
of foofy decorations

02:35.450 --> 02:38.719
to get our dates in the mood.
Lacy hearts and other crap.

02:38.754 --> 02:40.554
And a keg of
premium beer, too.

02:40.589 --> 02:43.024
- Got it.
- Fancy.

02:43.058 --> 02:45.926
- Is this the KT house?
- It's Valentine's Day.

02:45.961 --> 02:48.996
And since it's our first
one since freshman year,

02:49.031 --> 02:50.464
I thought I could get
you something special.

02:50.499 --> 02:53.367
- Like you did freshman year?
- Exactly.

02:54.102 --> 02:55.302
What happened?

02:55.337 --> 02:57.304
Your gift to me
was a bottle of vodka.

02:57.339 --> 02:59.674
Which you drank and
promptly puked up. Remember?

02:59.708 --> 03:02.243
Actually, I don't remember
anything from that night,

03:02.277 --> 03:03.544
I'll take your word for it.

03:03.578 --> 03:05.880
I just don't want
a repeat of freshman year.

03:05.914 --> 03:08.315
Then I will humbly
request a do-over,

03:08.350 --> 03:11.285
because I'm going to get
you the greatest gift ever.

03:15.624 --> 03:16.557
That's OK, Cap.

03:16.591 --> 03:18.025
You're just not a,
you know,

03:18.060 --> 03:20.828
box of chocolates
and roses kind of guy.

03:20.862 --> 03:22.630
- Like Evan?
- Not just Evan.

03:22.664 --> 03:24.398
You're saying I'm your
worst boyfriend ever?

03:24.433 --> 03:25.933
- That's not what I meant.
- Yes, it is.

03:25.967 --> 03:28.069
But you're thinking of
old drunk vodka Cappie.

03:28.103 --> 03:31.405
Not the new and improved Cappie
with V-Day Kung Fu grip.

03:31.440 --> 03:35.342
OK, well, what's the new
action figure Cappie do?

03:35.377 --> 03:38.746
He gets you the most romantic
gift of your entire life,

03:38.780 --> 03:41.749
and then dances on the graves
of Valentines past.

03:41.783 --> 03:45.519
OK then,
Kung Fu-Valentine-Cappie...

03:45.554 --> 03:47.688
I guess everyone
deserves a second shot.

03:51.827 --> 03:54.562
Yeah. Good shot.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
Sync by fant0m
www.addic7ed.com

04:08.310 --> 04:10.544
Grant? What's going on?

04:10.579 --> 04:13.314
Nothing, just give
me a minute.

04:18.220 --> 04:20.553
What... the hell?

04:22.324 --> 04:23.724
You're not
supposed to be home yet.

04:23.759 --> 04:25.025
My class
was canceled.

04:25.060 --> 04:27.595
I didn't mean
to walk in on this.

04:27.629 --> 04:30.397
I'm bleaching my hair
for our date party.

04:30.432 --> 04:33.033
Something I've always wanted
to do ever since I came out.

04:33.068 --> 04:37.037
The strip's for the pores...
And, uh...

04:37.072 --> 04:39.073
The trays are
for teeth whitening...

04:39.107 --> 04:42.843
And the newspaper? Wait,
I don't really want to know.

04:42.878 --> 04:45.780
I'm shaving my chest
and my neck.

04:45.814 --> 04:49.016
And a little bit off
the top of my feet.

04:49.050 --> 04:50.184
Good to know, Frodo.

04:50.218 --> 04:52.119
I can't do this in
the communal bathroom.

04:52.154 --> 04:53.621
It's way too embarrassing.

04:53.655 --> 04:56.524
So... We don't have
separate rooms, and...

04:56.558 --> 05:01.395
No, I get it. I'm just gonna
let you get some priva...

05:06.501 --> 05:08.269
Now, there are only 60

05:08.303 --> 05:10.871
Valen-Titan Bears left for our
Children's Hospital fundraiser,

05:10.906 --> 05:14.408
so I want us all to work very hard
to find these little guys a home, OK?

05:14.442 --> 05:17.111
No one wants to be alone on
Valentine's Day, right, Mr. Teddy?

05:17.145 --> 05:20.214
Lastly, if any of you do not
have Valentine's Day plans,

05:20.248 --> 05:21.782
you are welcome to join me

05:21.817 --> 05:23.751
for single ladies' chocolate
fondue in Pierson's Hall.

05:23.785 --> 05:24.819
Anyone?

05:27.656 --> 05:28.923
OK.

05:30.158 --> 05:31.458
Dismissed.

05:33.528 --> 05:35.129
Hi, Katherine.

05:35.163 --> 05:38.632
- Yes, ZBZ?
- Yes, hi. So, I was thinking

05:38.667 --> 05:41.936
I could volunteer to sell the rest
of the Valen-Titan Bears myself.

05:41.970 --> 05:44.171
- To help you out?
- That won't be necessary.

05:44.206 --> 05:46.740
- But you just said we...
- No. I've got it. Thank you.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:56.651 --> 05:58.986
Oh. Are those from Pete?

05:59.020 --> 06:00.454
I'm only supposed to serve food,

06:00.488 --> 06:03.023
not pick up deliveries
from your would-be paramours.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.626
That's right,
run to it, you succubae.

06:05.660 --> 06:08.395
So who's the most
loved this year?

06:08.430 --> 06:10.130
You are, of course.

06:11.099 --> 06:12.099
By Cappie.

06:13.368 --> 06:16.937
- He told me a...
- OK.

06:16.972 --> 06:18.372
Hey, Ash.

06:18.406 --> 06:20.608
I just came from a Panhel
meeting with Katherine.

06:20.642 --> 06:22.710
She still hates me,
made worse by the fact

06:22.744 --> 06:24.678
that she's spending
Valentine's Day alone.

06:24.713 --> 06:26.814
Which is why I have
to find her a date.

06:26.848 --> 06:28.549
No, you don't.

06:28.583 --> 06:30.451
What if you set her up
on a bad date?

06:30.485 --> 06:32.486
- Beaver, anyone?
- We burned down her house,

06:32.520 --> 06:36.257
it couldn't get much worse. But
if I find her an awesome guy,

06:36.291 --> 06:39.460
then she will totally appreciate
me and we can be friends again.

06:39.494 --> 06:41.295
So who do we know,
who do we know?

06:41.329 --> 06:42.897
That's not taken?

06:42.931 --> 06:44.164
No one.

06:45.133 --> 06:46.967
Oh, wait! Wait...

06:47.002 --> 06:49.570
- Rusty does not have a date.
- I think he's OK with it.

06:49.604 --> 06:51.772
Mom sends him
conversation hearts though.

06:51.806 --> 06:53.908
- Who else?
- No, think about it.

06:53.942 --> 06:56.010
Katherine and Rusty
are both Greeks.

06:56.044 --> 06:58.279
They are both
smart and awkward.

06:58.313 --> 07:01.382
Maybe their shared oddness
could cancel each other out.

07:02.584 --> 07:03.717
Yay.

07:03.752 --> 07:05.185
I haven't even agreed
with you yet.

07:05.220 --> 07:08.122
No.
It's my invite from Pete.

07:08.156 --> 07:10.858
"You caught my eye."
Aw! Get it?

07:10.892 --> 07:12.293
Because we met at
the Greek softball game.

07:12.327 --> 07:14.561
It's a good thing he's rich
because that's lame.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.031
Oh, and here comes Evan.

07:17.065 --> 07:19.300
- I wonder what he got you.
- Hey.

07:22.904 --> 07:24.371
It's a little buddy.

07:24.406 --> 07:27.174
And he wants to know if you'll
go to our date party with me.

07:27.208 --> 07:28.208
Please tell me
you're kidding.

07:28.243 --> 07:29.677
Yes on the bear.
No on the party.

07:29.711 --> 07:33.013
Valentine's Day? Really?
A day to celebrate love

07:33.048 --> 07:36.317
with meaningless cheap candy
and trinkets made in China?

07:36.351 --> 07:38.385
Excuse me, the bear
is made in Chile.

07:38.420 --> 07:41.221
And it's a party. It'll be
fun, we can make fun of people.

07:41.256 --> 07:43.524
I do like
making fun of people.

07:43.558 --> 07:47.094
- What time should I pick you up?
- I'll think about it.

07:53.902 --> 07:58.205
Having an all-access pass to your
boyfriend's life this soon kinda kills the magic.

07:58.239 --> 08:00.541
It's like for straight guys
when Megan Fox speaks.

08:02.177 --> 08:04.278
Are we becoming one of
those gay married couples

08:04.312 --> 08:06.847
that host dinner parties
and watch Bravo?

08:09.751 --> 08:12.653
Alright.
What's going on, Rus?

08:12.687 --> 08:15.823
I've decided to find a date for Valentine's
Day, I'm looking for a girl to ask out.

08:15.857 --> 08:17.358
Now? It's in two days.

08:17.392 --> 08:19.893
I've had years of
Valentine's Day loneliness.

08:19.928 --> 08:22.229
No. Look, the expectation
will kill you.

08:22.263 --> 08:26.533
It's bad enough I have to have my first out
date party with Grant on Valentine's Day.

08:26.568 --> 08:30.571
The last thing you want is to surround
yourself with a bunch of people in love.

08:30.605 --> 08:32.306
It's better
than being alone.

08:34.909 --> 08:36.643
Here goes.

08:37.712 --> 08:40.714
Hi, you don't know me,
but I'm Rusty.

08:40.749 --> 08:44.018
- Hi, Rusty. Tabitha.
- Nice to meet you, Tabitha.

08:44.052 --> 08:46.453
Um, I hope I'm not
being too forward,

08:46.488 --> 08:50.224
but my fraternity's having
this date party on Saturday...

08:50.258 --> 08:53.694
You're asking me on a first
date on Valentine's Day?

08:53.728 --> 08:55.429
Well, I saw you...

08:55.463 --> 08:56.730
I thought you were pretty...

08:56.765 --> 08:58.966
And uh... This is for you.

09:01.002 --> 09:04.104
"Lick my..."
Oh, my God!

09:05.373 --> 09:07.074
Perv.

09:14.082 --> 09:18.419
My mom must've accidentally
bought me the X-rated brand.

09:18.453 --> 09:20.154
Or the box was
meant for your dad.

09:20.188 --> 09:22.022
Traumatic, either way.

09:23.758 --> 09:26.727
Well, I gotta say,
much points for the gift.

09:26.761 --> 09:29.463
Well, I gotta say I'm excited
to have you as my date.

09:29.497 --> 09:31.999
Well, I'm excited to be had.
As your date.

09:32.033 --> 09:34.835
Hey, guys.

09:34.869 --> 09:37.504
So, Pete, the Omega Chi
Date Party is this Saturday.

09:37.539 --> 09:41.375
- Why haven't I heard from you?
- Because I'm taking Ashleigh.

09:42.944 --> 09:45.245
- But you said we were going.
- You did?

09:45.280 --> 09:47.514
We talked about that,
when we dated last month.

09:47.549 --> 09:52.119
But I assumed you understood we weren't going
out on Valentine's Day after we broke up.

09:52.153 --> 09:53.187
We broke up?

09:54.556 --> 09:57.758
- This is how you tell me?
- Yeah, I figured when I said,

09:57.792 --> 09:59.793
"I think we should
see other people,"

09:59.828 --> 10:02.496
- that you got that.
- Well, I do now, Pete,

10:02.530 --> 10:04.631
because I don't date cheaters.

10:08.870 --> 10:11.105
I can't believe she just
called me a cheater.

10:11.139 --> 10:14.141
Yeah. Neither can I.

10:16.511 --> 10:20.647
Taken, married,
incarcerated...

10:20.682 --> 10:25.018
No. I'm sorry you can't make it.
Good luck with the surgery.

10:25.053 --> 10:28.188
A C-Section? How old
are these phone numbers?

10:28.223 --> 10:30.324
Well, hopefully older
than nine months.

10:30.358 --> 10:31.959
Have we gone through
all the phones?

10:31.993 --> 10:34.061
Except for Pickle's.
He knows a lot of girls

10:34.095 --> 10:35.829
from the 900 area code.

10:35.864 --> 10:37.564
I should have listened
to my professor,

10:37.599 --> 10:40.267
who was smart enough to realize
that Valentine's Day sucks.

10:40.301 --> 10:42.569
I get it, Rus.
There's a lot of expectations.

10:42.604 --> 10:44.671
Like finding the perfect gift.

10:44.706 --> 10:46.640
You think Casey would
like a used cell phone?

10:46.674 --> 10:50.110
You know what...
Forget it.

10:50.145 --> 10:52.279
Why should I care that I'm alone
on February 14th?

10:52.313 --> 10:55.115
Because society and the greeting
card industry tell me not to be?

10:55.150 --> 10:57.151
Are you saying that because
you don't have a date?

10:57.185 --> 10:58.919
I mean it. I'm over it.
I'm over the hype.

10:58.953 --> 10:59.987
I'm finally free.

11:01.222 --> 11:02.656
Hey, Rus.

11:02.690 --> 11:04.458
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:04.492 --> 11:05.893
Ash told me about your problem,

11:05.927 --> 11:09.263
and I think I found you
a date for your party.

11:09.297 --> 11:11.098
My friend Katherine
is available,

11:11.132 --> 11:13.634
and you were the
first person I thought of.

11:13.668 --> 11:15.235
So what do you say?

11:15.270 --> 11:17.538
I think you're too late,
because he just said...

11:17.572 --> 11:19.306
No, I'm in.
I love Valentine's Day.

11:19.340 --> 11:21.675
- Yay!
- What?

11:28.734 --> 11:31.236
What's Katherine like? I'm
not being judgmental, but...

11:31.270 --> 11:33.171
Down, boy.
You're going to find out.

11:33.206 --> 11:35.240
Katherine wants to set up a
pre-date tonight at Dobler's.

11:35.274 --> 11:36.708
- A pre-date?
- Don't worry.

11:36.742 --> 11:38.510
Casey and I'll be there
in case you screw up.

11:38.544 --> 11:41.113
- Her words, not mine.
- So, Katherine...

11:41.147 --> 11:43.715
She was at Greek softball.
She's tall, she's pretty.

11:43.749 --> 11:45.717
- Oh, that's good.
- Let me finish.

11:45.751 --> 11:48.386
Stern. The word
"Nordic" comes to mind.

11:48.421 --> 11:49.554
I think I can handle that.

11:49.589 --> 11:51.690
I hope she's easier
than your sister.

11:51.724 --> 11:54.159
Try pleasing her.
Rewind.

11:54.193 --> 11:56.528
Try finding
the perfect gift for her.

11:56.562 --> 11:58.463
Get her something
from the heart.

11:58.498 --> 12:00.298
It's just about
the two of you.

12:00.333 --> 12:03.735
Imagine Casey, imagine the perfect
gift and then make it happen.

12:03.769 --> 12:06.805
Nice. That's the Spitter I want
to see at Dobler's tonight.

12:11.844 --> 12:15.480
So... What does one wear
to a KT Valentine's party?

12:15.515 --> 12:17.215
Same thing you wear
to any other party.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.985
They're not cavemen.
All of them.

12:20.019 --> 12:21.820
Well, I can tell you
what I wore

12:21.854 --> 12:23.288
when I went with Cappie.

12:23.322 --> 12:27.659
- Think tiny and wicked.
- Seems like it would fit you.

12:27.693 --> 12:29.294
So, why are you
buying a dress?

12:29.328 --> 12:31.530
I thought you were
anti-Valentine's.

12:31.564 --> 12:33.899
I agreed to go to
Evan's date party.

12:33.933 --> 12:35.634
He got me with his
big puppy dog eyes.

12:35.668 --> 12:37.369
He does that.

12:37.403 --> 12:39.504
Why am I even buying a dress?

12:39.539 --> 12:43.074
My date's probably just
another Fisher in worsted wool.

12:43.109 --> 12:46.978
Don't let Natalie the angry inch
spoil your next date with Pete.

12:47.013 --> 12:49.014
But she totally got in my head.

12:49.048 --> 12:50.482
It's like
I'm dating Eddie Cibrian.

12:50.516 --> 12:52.350
But am I LeAnn Rimes
or his wife?

12:52.385 --> 12:55.153
No. Natalie is a deceptive
little trickster.

12:55.188 --> 12:57.255
Need I remind you of the
electric bill debacle?

12:57.290 --> 12:59.057
You're probably still
sensitive over Fisher.

12:59.091 --> 13:00.892
- Because you made out with him?
- What's your point?

13:00.927 --> 13:03.261
You're right.
Pete deserves a first chance.

13:05.898 --> 13:09.834
Hey, Case, I bet you're getting
lingerie for Valentine's Day.

13:09.869 --> 13:12.604
OK, I get it.
You guys used to date.

13:12.638 --> 13:15.373
- Ha-ha.
- No, look.

13:18.644 --> 13:20.579
- Hi, Cap.
- Hey! Case.

13:20.613 --> 13:22.714
- Wha... Hey!
- Hi.

13:22.748 --> 13:24.182
Don't you love
this place?

13:24.217 --> 13:27.352
Nice try. Lingerie is more
of a gift for you than for me.

13:27.386 --> 13:29.387
What? It's for Beaver.

13:29.422 --> 13:32.224
Because... Beaver
likes to feel pretty.

13:32.258 --> 13:34.726
And since you're not having
to buy a gift for anybody,

13:34.760 --> 13:37.495
maybe you shouldn't talk.
'Cause it's not easy

13:37.530 --> 13:38.997
finding the perfect gift.

13:39.031 --> 13:41.399
Oh, please.
How hard could it be?

13:41.434 --> 13:43.034
Well, let's find out.
You versus me,

13:43.069 --> 13:46.338
to see who can get the other
the most romantic gift.

13:46.372 --> 13:49.207
Unless you're too scared I'll
outromanticize you or something.

13:49.242 --> 13:51.076
The only thing
I'm scared for is you.

13:51.110 --> 13:53.178
- Game on.
- If you think this is a game

13:53.212 --> 13:54.913
you've already lost.
See you tonight.

13:54.947 --> 13:57.315
- Not if I see you first.
- Oh!

14:07.460 --> 14:11.062
- Oh... Porn site crash?
- Uh... Worse, shopping.

14:11.097 --> 14:13.798
I convinced Rebecca to
come to our Valentine's party,

14:13.833 --> 14:16.868
and now I want to show the girl who
claims she doesn't believe in love

14:16.902 --> 14:18.236
how much she means to me.

14:18.271 --> 14:19.771
You're missing
your trust fund.

14:19.805 --> 14:22.974
You know, she's the first girl
that doesn't make me feel

14:23.009 --> 14:25.710
like I'm the evil guy that
everyone else thinks I am.

14:25.745 --> 14:30.782
She gets my background,
and why we are the way we are.

14:30.816 --> 14:32.317
She deserves something special.

14:32.351 --> 14:34.886
Oh, uh, speaking of...

14:34.920 --> 14:36.755
Ah, thanks, man.

14:36.789 --> 14:39.391
- That's really sweet.
- It's for Grant.

14:39.425 --> 14:41.926
Can I stash it here
until the party?

14:41.961 --> 14:43.762
Uh, yeah.
You can't hide it in your room?

14:43.796 --> 14:46.665
The room where
secrets go to die?

14:46.699 --> 14:49.467
No. We see way
too much as is.

14:49.502 --> 14:54.339
I'm already worried that the brothers won't
be OK with us out together at a date party.

14:54.373 --> 14:56.775
I'd say that any problems
they might have had,

14:56.809 --> 14:58.643
you took care of
at the softball game.

14:59.912 --> 15:03.148
So the only problem now is
Grant and I becoming boring.

15:03.182 --> 15:04.449
Great.

15:04.483 --> 15:06.318
Hopefully, that
won't happen to you two.

15:06.352 --> 15:08.920
I doubt it.
Rebecca lives for surprises.

15:13.326 --> 15:17.495
This is it. Success tonight
means my first Valentine.

15:17.530 --> 15:20.098
It's like I'm reliving
first grade through you.

15:29.875 --> 15:31.142
Katherine,

15:31.177 --> 15:33.778
this is my brother, Rusty.

15:33.813 --> 15:36.181
- So excited to meet you.
- Me too.

15:36.215 --> 15:38.083
Would you guys
stand back-to-back?

15:38.117 --> 15:39.484
Just real quick.
I just want to see something.

15:39.518 --> 15:40.852
Anyway...

15:40.886 --> 15:43.421
Rusty here was awarded
an engineering grant.

15:43.456 --> 15:46.958
Katherine is president of Panhellenic
and, quite possibly, America one day.

15:46.992 --> 15:49.094
- Wow. That's great.
- Yes.

15:49.128 --> 15:51.463
- Goals are great.
- Mmm-hmm.

15:53.532 --> 15:56.368
So Casey tells me
you're studying Poli Sci.

15:56.402 --> 15:58.336
I do, yes.

16:05.378 --> 16:09.848
So... Why is Political
Science called "Poli Sci,"

16:09.882 --> 16:12.450
and Polymer Science isn't?

16:12.485 --> 16:17.222
Because, politics isn't
an actual science, right?

16:18.891 --> 16:21.326
Or is it? I don't know.
You tell me.

16:21.360 --> 16:26.398
All I know is, that there
are no beakers in politics...

16:33.072 --> 16:34.973
So are you excited
about Valentine's Day?

16:35.007 --> 16:37.008
Yes.

16:43.048 --> 16:44.649
Speaking of Valentine's Day,

16:44.683 --> 16:47.886
Casey and I are battling to see
who can get who the best gift.

16:47.920 --> 16:51.689
Oh, and today I came up with some
ideas that are gonna blow you away.

16:51.724 --> 16:55.593
Good luck with those ideas, because
I found you the perfect gift today.

16:55.628 --> 16:56.594
- You did?
- Mmm-hmm.

16:56.629 --> 16:58.196
Seriously?

16:58.230 --> 17:00.899
So, Casey tells me
you're a Gamma Psi.

17:00.933 --> 17:04.234
Do you like living in a house?
I mean, did you?

17:05.938 --> 17:07.739
Yes.

17:10.009 --> 17:11.876
Your house was probably
cleaner than ours.

17:11.911 --> 17:14.212
Once, when I was a pledge,

17:14.246 --> 17:16.647
I had to clean what I thought
was a quarter-pound of hair

17:16.682 --> 17:19.050
out of a shower drain,
but it was just this rat...

17:22.253 --> 17:24.622
You guys really
both like to study.

17:24.656 --> 17:26.223
Maybe you could
talk about that.

17:27.326 --> 17:29.160
Yes.

17:41.340 --> 17:43.107
Oh, no!
It didn't go well?

17:43.142 --> 17:46.211
It was the worst pairing since
Drew Barrymore and directing.

17:46.245 --> 17:49.247
I can officially kiss my
friendship with Katherine goodbye.

17:49.281 --> 17:50.315
You still have me.

17:50.349 --> 17:52.116
We won't be at
the same party this year.

17:52.151 --> 17:53.451
- I know.
- And...

17:53.486 --> 17:56.354
...I lied to Cappie about
getting him the perfect gift.

17:57.923 --> 18:00.825
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Laura said, "Head on up, bitch."

18:00.860 --> 18:02.861
No, that's fine.

18:02.895 --> 18:05.763
I was just going to show off
my new dress, anyway.

18:06.866 --> 18:09.467
- It's eclectic.
- Thank you.

18:12.304 --> 18:14.138
I know what this is about...

18:14.173 --> 18:16.007
Yes, we need to discuss
this Rusty incident.

18:16.041 --> 18:17.809
How could you possibly

18:17.843 --> 18:19.944
imagine that we'd have
anything in common?

18:19.979 --> 18:21.112
I just thought...

18:21.146 --> 18:24.015
Why did you think
that we'd get along?

18:24.049 --> 18:26.718
- I'm so, sorr...
- Because we did.

18:27.620 --> 18:29.354
He's so suave.

18:29.388 --> 18:31.856
- Really?
- Yes. And handsome.

18:31.891 --> 18:33.124
Really? You don't
have to be polite.

18:33.158 --> 18:35.260
No. But, really, so...

18:35.294 --> 18:37.962
Give me the deets.
Does Rusty work out?

18:39.398 --> 18:41.432
I think he did... once.

18:41.467 --> 18:45.270
Listen to me, I'm prattling on like
a schoolgirl. But I had so much fun.

18:45.304 --> 18:48.373
- He did too, right?
- How could he not? It's you.

18:48.407 --> 18:50.041
So Valentine's Day is a go.

18:50.075 --> 18:52.944
I'm being selfish, but I can't
think of anything else but tonight

18:52.978 --> 18:55.513
and the connection
that we made.

18:55.548 --> 18:57.782
I am so lucky to have
a friend like you.

18:57.816 --> 19:00.585
I am gonna go prepare. But I
will call you about my wardrobe.

19:03.822 --> 19:06.357
Well...

19:08.565 --> 19:10.333
Hello?

19:10.367 --> 19:13.169
- What's all this?
- Comfort food.

19:13.203 --> 19:16.039
I've accepted my fate
as Valentine's Day washout.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.307
Rus, did you get that
non-stick food I asked for?

19:18.342 --> 19:20.009
- Uh, Dale...
- Sometimes Bridget

19:20.044 --> 19:21.444
eats with her retainer in,

19:21.478 --> 19:23.746
and kissing her is like
eating lunch twice in one day.

19:27.017 --> 19:28.017
Hey, Casey.

19:29.253 --> 19:30.520
How long you been there?

19:30.554 --> 19:32.889
Long enough to taste
my lunch twice.

19:32.923 --> 19:34.157
No, I was just goofin'.

19:34.191 --> 19:37.560
We're not an item.
Bridget's Catholic.

19:37.594 --> 19:38.961
Well, good luck with that.

19:38.996 --> 19:42.198
Oh, that reminds me...
Uh, this is for you.

19:42.232 --> 19:43.966
But don't read it
in front of me.

19:44.001 --> 19:45.334
How...

19:45.369 --> 19:47.236
...could I?

19:53.310 --> 19:56.179
So... Good news.

19:56.213 --> 19:58.714
You can still have a date
to the KT party if you want,

19:58.749 --> 20:00.650
Katherine
totally likes you.

20:00.684 --> 20:02.652
- She thinks you're hot.
- Really?

20:02.686 --> 20:04.353
- That's what I said, too.
- After Dobler's?

20:04.388 --> 20:07.557
At least you'd have
a Valentine this once,

20:07.591 --> 20:08.658
excluding Mom.

20:08.692 --> 20:09.959
At least Mom
can hold a conversation.

20:09.993 --> 20:11.961
I'd rather have
no memories than bad ones

20:11.995 --> 20:14.697
- with one-word-answer girl.
- At least that word was "yes".

20:14.731 --> 20:16.666
A lot of guys would be
happy to hear that.

20:16.700 --> 20:19.836
OK, look Rus, I'm trying
to get back on her good side.

20:19.870 --> 20:21.704
We had a falling out.
Things got...

20:21.738 --> 20:24.140
...heated.
Please?

20:26.877 --> 20:29.846
OK. For one month's
free access to your car.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.582
I get you a date and you
blackmail me? Forget it.

20:32.616 --> 20:33.883
Fine, then you date her.

20:37.521 --> 20:40.556
OK, just pretend
to like her. OK?

20:44.895 --> 20:47.029
Hey, Ash!

20:47.064 --> 20:49.265
Don't you have a little wheel
you should be running in?

20:49.299 --> 20:50.900
I'm sorry
about the other day.

20:50.934 --> 20:52.702
Pete hurt me
really bad, and

20:52.736 --> 20:54.337
I don't want to see
you get hurt, too.

20:54.371 --> 20:57.173
- That's what these boys do.
- Why should I believe a girl

20:57.207 --> 20:59.876
who hooked up with a theater
major to win SongFest?

20:59.910 --> 21:03.212
Just because we're in different houses
doesn't mean we can't be sisters.

21:03.247 --> 21:05.181
As president of the
number one sorority,

21:05.215 --> 21:08.551
I want you, president of the number two
sorority, to know that we can be friends.

21:08.585 --> 21:10.887
And we, at the number
one sorority, want you,

21:10.921 --> 21:13.256
the number two sorority, to know
that I don't believe you.

21:13.290 --> 21:15.892
Pete's called me every day
for the past two weeks.

21:17.494 --> 21:19.128
How do I know this
is the real Pete

21:19.163 --> 21:21.631
and not you assigning his
name to another number?

21:21.665 --> 21:23.466
Natalie?

21:23.500 --> 21:26.202
<i>Hey, it's Pete. Look, sorry
I've been calling you so...</i>

21:26.236 --> 21:28.371
Don't let him hurt you, too.

21:32.376 --> 21:35.378
So this year,
I dug deep down in my heart,

21:35.412 --> 21:37.413
and made Casey
three presents

21:37.447 --> 21:40.149
for us to choose from that
no one else could get her.

21:40.184 --> 21:42.852
Prepare to be amazed.

21:42.886 --> 21:45.521
- Oh... Nice.
- Right?

21:45.556 --> 21:47.790
I raised it
from a young sapling,

21:47.824 --> 21:50.426
which I think will show
Casey my budding maturity.

21:50.460 --> 21:52.862
- Now, when you say "buds"?
- It's not that kind of plant.

21:52.896 --> 21:53.996
Yeah, I don't get it. Next.

21:55.199 --> 21:56.832
OK.

21:57.968 --> 22:00.369
A God's Eye
with ZBZ colors.

22:00.404 --> 22:03.239
'Cause I appreciate
her sorority allegiance.

22:03.273 --> 22:06.309
- And I'm a big kid. Get it?
- I'm just not feeling it, Cap.

22:06.343 --> 22:09.478
I mean, I understand it,
but it doesn't get me here.

22:09.513 --> 22:11.614
OK. All right

22:14.318 --> 22:17.119
A macaroni necklace.

22:17.154 --> 22:20.122
I don't think you're
supposed to cook the macaroni.

22:20.157 --> 22:21.924
God, I must've missed
that week at camp.

22:21.959 --> 22:24.560
<i>- May I?
- Of course. Yeah, Bon appetit.</i>

22:24.595 --> 22:27.964
Great, the party's in
an hour and I have squat.

22:29.499 --> 22:31.968
And now I have
to go get ready. Ugh!

22:33.103 --> 22:35.104
It's good.

22:38.609 --> 22:41.911
So, do you want
to walk down together?

22:41.945 --> 22:45.114
Uh, no. I'm going to get
dressed in the bathroom.

22:45.148 --> 22:47.717
What? Look...

22:47.751 --> 22:50.353
I'm sorry if I've come off
as a jerk lately, it's just...

22:50.387 --> 22:53.689
No, things have been
a little unromantic.

22:53.724 --> 22:56.158
And I want to spice them up.

22:56.193 --> 22:59.996
Evan may have mentioned
your conversation to me.

23:00.030 --> 23:05.034
I want a real date, special.
Maybe a surprise?

23:06.236 --> 23:08.904
Well, I can't wait
to be surprised.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.241
Good.

23:23.053 --> 23:24.987
- You look amazing.
- Uh-huh.

23:25.022 --> 23:26.522
Thanks. Can I see
your cell phone?

23:26.556 --> 23:28.224
- Mine's dead.
- Yeah. Sure.

23:31.528 --> 23:34.196
So, have you talked
to Natalie lately?

23:34.231 --> 23:36.299
Yeah. I've called her
a bunch of times, actually.

23:36.333 --> 23:38.968
A-ha!
Wait, why?

23:39.002 --> 23:40.803
'Cause she has
my history textbook,

23:40.837 --> 23:42.038
and she won't give it back.

23:42.072 --> 23:46.075
Oh. Well, here's
your cell phone back.

23:52.716 --> 23:54.216
For you.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.827
Evan.

24:04.861 --> 24:06.028
It's, uh...

24:07.431 --> 24:09.832
It's way too beautiful.

24:09.866 --> 24:12.668
I feel like I'm gonna turn on the
news and see some dead rich girl.

24:12.703 --> 24:16.238
Nah, I dug the ditch
pretty deep.

24:16.273 --> 24:19.775
I had some money put away.
It's no big deal.

24:19.810 --> 24:21.577
This looks like a big deal.

24:21.611 --> 24:23.245
Well, I saw it

24:23.280 --> 24:25.581
and thought it'd look
really good on you.

24:26.383 --> 24:28.417
Let's try it, shall we?

24:31.154 --> 24:32.788
There you go.

24:36.493 --> 24:37.727
Thank you.

24:46.970 --> 24:48.104
You guys are leaving now?

24:48.138 --> 24:52.174
- Um, have fun.
- You too, Case.

24:57.948 --> 24:59.615
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

24:59.649 --> 25:00.750
Want to exchange
gifts now?

25:00.784 --> 25:04.253
Uh... I think gifts
are better left

25:04.287 --> 25:07.223
- to the end of the evening.
- Ah.

25:07.257 --> 25:09.925
- If I can find her one by then.
- Where is she?

25:09.960 --> 25:12.294
- Let's get this over with.
- Uh...

25:20.804 --> 25:23.739
- Whoa...
- No kidding.

25:23.774 --> 25:25.841
Stop drooling, Rus.

25:25.876 --> 25:30.946
- Hi. You look amazing.
- You look very dapper yourself.

25:30.981 --> 25:32.014
Moving on?

25:43.538 --> 25:45.439
Looks like the pledges
did me proud.

25:48.176 --> 25:51.578
- I'm nervous.
- Because we're at a KT party?

25:51.612 --> 25:54.414
- No, because of Rusty.
- Really?

25:54.449 --> 25:56.550
You keep saying that.

26:02.323 --> 26:04.391
- How spirited of them.
- Jell-O shot?

26:04.425 --> 26:05.392
Of love?

26:05.426 --> 26:06.526
- OK.
- Thank you.

26:10.231 --> 26:11.932
Pickle.
Who's your date?

26:11.966 --> 26:15.335
I'd like you guys to meet
Mrs. Joanne Fletcher.

26:17.905 --> 26:20.374
How sweet,
he brought his mom.

26:23.478 --> 26:25.379
That's not his mom.

26:35.890 --> 26:38.291
So... you want to
shoot some arrows?

26:38.326 --> 26:39.893
Yes.

26:43.498 --> 26:47.100
I have to admit, I didn't think
you'd want to go to a KT pty.

26:47.135 --> 26:48.602
It didn't seem like you.

26:48.636 --> 26:50.904
- No offense.
- None taken.

26:50.938 --> 26:55.409
I have to admit I didn't think I'd find
a Gary Wyatt Grant winner at KT either.

26:55.443 --> 26:57.244
- It was a little intimidating.
- Really?

26:57.278 --> 26:59.946
Is that why you kept giving me
one-word answers at Dobler's?

26:59.981 --> 27:01.615
It's the quickest way
to get to know someone.

27:01.649 --> 27:03.950
You just let them
do all the talking.

27:03.985 --> 27:06.486
And I liked what I heard.

27:12.560 --> 27:14.728
I was a Boy Scout.

27:20.735 --> 27:21.968
Holy crap.

27:22.003 --> 27:23.703
I made it to the Olympic
trials when I was 11.

27:23.738 --> 27:25.305
There aren't too many

27:25.339 --> 27:28.275
overachieving Greeks
like you here at CRU.

27:28.309 --> 27:30.243
I guess I am
somewhat of an amalgam.

27:32.246 --> 27:33.580
Let me show you.

28:02.343 --> 28:04.377
- Hey!
- Happy, VD.

28:04.412 --> 28:06.480
Hey. What's up?

28:06.514 --> 28:08.181
I feel like I never
see you anymore.

28:08.216 --> 28:10.317
I know. You're all
holed up with Grant all day.

28:10.351 --> 28:12.752
- So, you guys good?
- I think so.

28:12.787 --> 28:14.721
We certainly see
a lot of each other.

28:14.755 --> 28:18.191
Sometimes too much.
But we're working it out.

28:18.226 --> 28:20.227
I get it. The perils
of living under the same roof.

28:20.261 --> 28:23.430
Of course, in my case
it was because Fisher was

28:23.464 --> 28:25.799
CRU's version
of David Letterman.

28:26.734 --> 28:27.734
Hey, guys.

28:29.570 --> 28:32.439
Oh, my God!
You look hot.

28:32.473 --> 28:35.709
Thanks, Ash.
Cal? What do you think?

28:35.743 --> 28:38.445
I think you look...

28:38.479 --> 28:39.779
- ...spicy.
- Right?

28:39.814 --> 28:41.715
I know it's not me,
but I'm kinda diggin' it.

28:41.749 --> 28:43.250
Could be more
where this came from.

28:43.284 --> 28:45.118
I'm gonna get us
some drinks.

28:52.326 --> 28:55.562
Stop it. I know
what you're thinking.

28:55.596 --> 28:57.564
This is like the
same thing as Michael.

28:57.598 --> 28:58.999
Michael would
never wear that.

28:59.033 --> 29:01.735
You asked for a surprise,
and you got it.

29:01.769 --> 29:05.672
So enjoy your spicy hot
out-and-proud man.

29:09.043 --> 29:11.378
Oh, God.
It's Tinker-Hell.

29:11.412 --> 29:13.747
- Hey, Pete.
- Hey there.

29:13.781 --> 29:15.515
Get me a drink.

29:15.550 --> 29:16.883
She's after Pete.

29:16.918 --> 29:19.486
She's like a little
Valentine parasite.

29:27.862 --> 29:29.529
Nice work, Tony Hopkins.

29:29.564 --> 29:31.464
I stole it from
the Lamda Sig house.

29:31.499 --> 29:34.501
All right, here.
Keep the change.

29:38.773 --> 29:40.540
Well, you look confident.

29:40.575 --> 29:42.809
Are you prepared
to lose all control

29:42.843 --> 29:45.879
and attempt to ravage my body
right here on the dance floor?

29:45.913 --> 29:47.614
Well, let's see what you got.

29:47.648 --> 29:51.284
- Ta-da!
- Seriously.

29:51.319 --> 29:53.587
Well, it's tragedy
plus time equals comedy.

29:53.621 --> 29:55.755
It reminds us of our
first time together.

29:55.790 --> 29:58.224
And takes us back to
younger, simpler days.

29:58.259 --> 29:59.759
Yeah, and it takes us
back to the time

29:59.794 --> 30:01.595
you bought me vodka
for Valentine's Day

30:01.629 --> 30:03.830
and drank it
and threw up. On me.

30:03.864 --> 30:05.332
I left that part
out earlier.

30:05.366 --> 30:08.501
But... um...
thanks for the vodka.

30:08.536 --> 30:11.171
It's a callback.
I get it, it's funny.

30:11.205 --> 30:12.639
Gotcha!

30:12.673 --> 30:14.808
Actually, it's,

30:14.842 --> 30:17.444
tragedy plus time
plus you falling for it.

30:17.478 --> 30:19.412
- Oh.
- 'Cause vodka equals

30:19.447 --> 30:22.015
- not my real gift.
- So this is not your real gift?

30:22.049 --> 30:24.651
This? No! Hell no!

30:24.685 --> 30:27.520
I will give you
your real gift...

30:27.555 --> 30:29.155
...later on.

30:29.190 --> 30:31.124
Then I'll give you
your gift later, too.

30:31.158 --> 30:32.192
Great.

30:37.465 --> 30:38.765
Hey, you two.

30:38.799 --> 30:42.168
You can cut the crap, Nat.
I know why Pete called you.

30:42.203 --> 30:46.673
Oh! No, Ash. I just
wanted to apologize.

30:46.707 --> 30:48.274
I went too far
at the Student Union,

30:48.309 --> 30:51.945
and I'm truly, truly sorry.
It's just, um...

30:51.979 --> 30:54.014
The worst thing that
ever has happened to me

30:54.048 --> 30:58.451
happened on Valentine's Day.
Oh, God. It was so horrible.

30:58.486 --> 31:01.321
It was Valentine's Eve.
I was nine years old.

31:01.355 --> 31:04.658
Me and Mom were decorating the tree,
waiting for Dad to come home from work.

31:04.692 --> 31:06.726
A couple hours went by.
Dad still wasn't home.

31:06.761 --> 31:10.063
So Mom called the office
and no answer.

31:10.097 --> 31:13.133
So the police began a search.

31:13.167 --> 31:15.969
And four or five days later...

31:16.003 --> 31:18.471
You tried to light a fire,
and you noticed the smell,

31:18.506 --> 31:20.674
the firemen came and they
pulled out your dead dad.

31:20.708 --> 31:21.908
- Blah, blah, blah...
- Ash.

31:21.942 --> 31:23.743
<i>- Pete.
- That story is from Gremlins.</i>

31:23.778 --> 31:26.413
The only reason you're telling
it is because you are one.

31:26.447 --> 31:29.616
So don't feed her after midnight
or she'll turn uglier.

31:29.650 --> 31:31.751
Ash... Whoa.
Chill out.

31:31.786 --> 31:35.288
Nat, why don't we go
get you some water. OK?

31:44.398 --> 31:46.499
Can I admit something?

31:46.534 --> 31:49.335
This is my first
Valentine's date ever.

31:51.005 --> 31:52.839
It's mine, too.

31:54.241 --> 31:58.278
I rarely date.
Or go to parties.

32:01.015 --> 32:02.615
I got into
Yale Law School.

32:02.650 --> 32:05.085
Oh, wow.
You must be excited.

32:05.119 --> 32:06.886
And terrified.

32:06.921 --> 32:10.256
I've lived my whole life for the
future at the expense of the present.

32:10.291 --> 32:14.527
So now I have to fit the entire
college experience into one semester.

32:14.562 --> 32:19.899
And I want to be more
than the geeky smart girl.

32:19.934 --> 32:22.335
- Is that sad?
- Why do you think I rushed KT?

32:22.369 --> 32:24.437
I want to be more than
the geeky smart girl, too.

32:25.473 --> 32:26.473
I mean, guy.

32:30.544 --> 32:34.180
I think Casey sometimes worries
about it in the opposite direction.

32:34.215 --> 32:37.617
That she waited too long
to find something beyond ZBZ.

32:37.651 --> 32:40.220
It's sweet of you
to think of her.

32:40.254 --> 32:42.155
And though
I'll never admit it,

32:42.189 --> 32:45.058
I think your sister's doing
a fine job of catching up.

32:45.092 --> 32:47.127
I guess we all
have regrets.

32:47.161 --> 32:50.663
I don't think
I'll regret this.

32:57.138 --> 33:00.607
I am so glad I changed my
mind about a second date.

33:01.408 --> 33:03.643
- What?
- What.

33:03.677 --> 33:07.447
Casey said that you had
a great time on our first date.

33:07.481 --> 33:09.182
Was she telling the truth?

33:10.317 --> 33:11.985
Yeah.

33:12.019 --> 33:14.788
- Well, I mean, sort of...
- Clearly not.

33:15.790 --> 33:17.157
So she convinced you how?

33:17.191 --> 33:20.426
Did she express pity for me?
Appeal to your sense of charity?

33:20.461 --> 33:21.961
She belittle
my chocolate fondue?

33:21.996 --> 33:23.897
Because I could tell
she thought it was lame.

33:23.931 --> 33:26.499
Casey loves fondue.
She really likes you, too.

33:26.534 --> 33:28.334
But...

33:28.369 --> 33:29.369
...you don't?

33:29.370 --> 33:31.304
I do, and I'll
prove it to you.

33:31.338 --> 33:33.573
I'll tell her that I don't
want, or need, her car.

33:33.607 --> 33:35.375
She bribed you
with her car?.

33:35.409 --> 33:37.644
Am I that pathetic?
And what are you?

33:37.678 --> 33:40.246
Some brother-whore to be bought
and traded like a commodity?

33:40.281 --> 33:41.581
Casey, hi. Great!

33:41.615 --> 33:43.516
Did you offer
your car to Rusty

33:43.551 --> 33:45.251
to date me so we
could be friends?

33:45.286 --> 33:46.452
Katherine, look.
I thought...

33:46.487 --> 33:48.822
I need to breathe.
I need to think.

33:48.856 --> 33:52.091
I wanted us to be friends
because I respect and admire you.

33:52.126 --> 33:53.927
- I just want you to be happy.
- Me, too.

33:53.961 --> 33:55.495
Forget about what
brought us here.

33:55.529 --> 33:56.963
Just think about
what is going on now.

33:56.997 --> 33:59.799
I'm thinking.

33:59.834 --> 34:03.336
Why don't you just give me one
reason why I should forgive you.

34:03.370 --> 34:04.838
Heads up!

34:04.872 --> 34:06.973
Oh, my gosh!

34:13.023 --> 34:16.125
First a fire, now this. Katherine's
gonna think we're trying to kill her.

34:16.159 --> 34:18.027
Are you?

34:18.061 --> 34:19.862
I'm the one
she's going to hate.

34:19.896 --> 34:22.063
Just when I think
I kinda like her.

34:22.099 --> 34:24.400
- Really?
- Daley?

34:24.434 --> 34:25.501
Dale? What are
you doing here?

34:25.534 --> 34:27.469
Drama, Rus.
Had to bring Bridget in.

34:27.504 --> 34:29.338
There was a...

34:29.371 --> 34:33.742
...accident.
Involving her retainer.

34:33.777 --> 34:37.313
She's gonna be fine, but
I'm gonna need some stitches.

34:38.782 --> 34:41.417
Oh, thank God!
Katherine, you're OK!

34:41.451 --> 34:43.284
"Tis only a flesh wound."

34:43.320 --> 34:44.853
Monty Python.
That's funny.

34:44.888 --> 34:46.088
"We are the Knights
who say, 'Ni'."

34:46.123 --> 34:49.190
I've got you on
strong pain killers.

34:49.226 --> 34:50.693
A good thing the arrow
was blunt-tipped

34:50.726 --> 34:52.962
or you'd be spending
Valentine's Day in the morgue.

34:52.996 --> 34:54.530
Just like
the real Valentine.

34:54.563 --> 34:56.297
I bet you'll never
forget the first time

34:56.333 --> 34:57.967
you were struck
by Cupid's arrow.

34:58.001 --> 34:59.635
Actually it was Pickle's.

34:59.669 --> 35:01.537
- He said he was sorry.
- Casey...

35:01.571 --> 35:03.839
...you went to all this trouble
to be friends with me?

35:03.874 --> 35:08.277
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

35:08.311 --> 35:09.578
So, thank you.

35:10.580 --> 35:12.548
- Ni.
- I'll walk her home.

35:12.582 --> 35:14.517
Uh, yeah...

35:16.219 --> 35:17.686
Well, that's probably

35:17.721 --> 35:19.622
the strangest injury
you've had all night, right?

35:19.656 --> 35:21.290
Not really.

35:33.303 --> 35:34.370
You OK?

35:34.404 --> 35:37.506
I can't find my boyfriend.
Have you seen him?

35:39.709 --> 35:42.578
Ha-ha. What's your problem?
He's freakin' beautiful.

35:42.612 --> 35:46.315
Oh, I know.
I just prefer my men handsome.

35:46.349 --> 35:49.084
What's the difference? When
I came out that one week

35:49.119 --> 35:52.087
I totally wanted to listen to
Indigo Girls and wear no makeup.

35:52.122 --> 35:53.923
Grant's experimenting
with the lifestyle.

35:53.957 --> 35:56.358
- Big whoop. It's natural.
- So I'm overreacting?

35:56.393 --> 35:57.660
You are a pretty uptight gay.

35:57.694 --> 35:59.662
Lighten up.
If you want it to work,

35:59.696 --> 36:01.197
it's something you're
gonna have to do.

36:02.599 --> 36:04.934
Or I could just buy him
a really fancy necklace.

36:04.968 --> 36:07.403
- Is that from Evan?
- I've decided I like it.

36:07.437 --> 36:09.104
It's a keepsake
I can keep forever.

36:09.139 --> 36:11.140
I think that was his idea.

36:12.842 --> 36:15.177
Really?
He said that?

36:15.212 --> 36:17.079
Well, more or less.

36:17.113 --> 36:21.617
He says that you get him
more than anyone else.

36:21.651 --> 36:24.587
I think he sees
a future with you.

36:24.621 --> 36:27.489
- I pe it works out.
- Uh-huh.

36:28.458 --> 36:29.925
I'm gonna go get some air.

36:37.767 --> 36:40.436
Pete, can I talk to you
for a second? Alone?

36:40.470 --> 36:43.272
What? I'm not
doing anything.

36:43.306 --> 36:46.875
- Except hurting inside.
- She's really upset, Ash.

36:46.910 --> 36:50.246
Seriously? How are you
buying this whole martyr act?

36:50.280 --> 36:52.314
I'm the good one.
She's LeAnn Rimes.

36:52.349 --> 36:54.116
She burned down my house.

36:54.150 --> 36:57.386
Yeah, Ashleigh didn't think
we deserved to win SongFest,

36:57.420 --> 36:59.788
so she snuck in
and set it on fire.

37:03.059 --> 37:04.727
Nat, that's just crazy.

37:04.761 --> 37:06.629
- What?
- What? I mean...

37:06.663 --> 37:10.332
Yeah, that is
a total lie, Natalie.

37:10.367 --> 37:14.169
Kinda like the one where you said that we
paid for your electric bill last semester.

37:14.204 --> 37:16.005
Yeah, everyone,
that is a lie, too.

37:16.039 --> 37:18.007
No. That's the truth.

37:18.041 --> 37:19.608
You know it, Ashleigh,
tell them!

37:19.643 --> 37:20.909
- Nat, whoa.
- What?

37:20.944 --> 37:23.112
- That you're crazy?
- You're lying.

37:23.146 --> 37:25.581
You're all lying.
I know what I'm talking about.

37:25.615 --> 37:27.683
I'm not crazy, damn it.

37:27.717 --> 37:30.185
Could someone walk her home
so she doesn't hurt herself?

37:30.220 --> 37:31.587
C'mon, Natalie,
I'll walk you home.

37:31.621 --> 37:33.455
Hands off me,
Carrot-top.

37:33.490 --> 37:35.891
Ha-ha! Carrot-top!
That is harsh.

37:37.694 --> 37:39.528
Good luck with that, dude!

37:42.098 --> 37:45.768
Sorry I didn't believe
that Nat's crazy.

37:45.802 --> 37:48.671
It's just that when
she called me a cheater

37:48.705 --> 37:51.040
I felt bad,
and it kinda hurt

37:51.074 --> 37:52.308
that you didn't
trust me, either.

37:52.342 --> 37:54.810
I just didn't want
to be hurt by you.

37:54.844 --> 37:57.713
How about we promise
not to hurt each other?

37:57.747 --> 37:58.914
I'm good with that.

38:00.116 --> 38:01.517
So...

38:01.551 --> 38:03.152
.where were we?

38:04.354 --> 38:05.888
Right here.

38:28.712 --> 38:30.212
I thought you bailed.

38:33.917 --> 38:36.885
I was here, doing this.
Surprise.

38:36.920 --> 38:40.122
You are just
full of surprises.

38:40.156 --> 38:42.391
So is the ensemble
too much?

38:42.425 --> 38:45.661
I once dumped a guy
for being too foofy.

38:45.695 --> 38:49.898
- OK, too much.
- No wait. I'm not done.

38:49.933 --> 38:52.835
I don't want to be
an uptight gay.

38:52.869 --> 38:54.470
All right?

38:54.504 --> 38:58.140
I want to be
as brave as you.

38:58.174 --> 38:59.641
Maybe explore a little.

39:01.845 --> 39:03.011
With you.

39:04.381 --> 39:06.482
<i>âª It's the only thing âª</i>

39:06.516 --> 39:10.519
<i>âª That keeps me on my feet âª</i>

39:14.791 --> 39:17.292
Sorry.
Have you seen Rebecca?

39:17.327 --> 39:20.896
Yeah, she said that
she was gonna get some air.

39:22.065 --> 39:24.767
OK, um... Carry on.

39:28.071 --> 39:30.506
<i>âª Again âª</i>

39:38.281 --> 39:42.718
- Angie. This is Rusty.
- Hi.

39:42.752 --> 39:46.321
Your skin is so soft.

39:51.928 --> 39:54.696
God, I am so sorry
you were struck by an arrow.

39:54.731 --> 39:56.965
That's what I get
for dating a bad boy.

40:01.638 --> 40:03.806
I don't know
if you've noticed,

40:03.840 --> 40:05.574
but sometimes
I'm socially awkward,

40:05.608 --> 40:08.010
and I don't really
know what to do

40:08.044 --> 40:11.180
- or to say...
- I haven't noticed.

40:11.214 --> 40:14.583
Well, I'm sorry that I
wasn't much of a Valentine.

40:14.617 --> 40:17.986
Well, that was the least suckiest
Valentine's Day I've ever had.

40:18.822 --> 40:20.122
Me too.

40:31.267 --> 40:33.135
OK. Thank you.

40:44.414 --> 40:48.050
- Rebecca. Hey.
- Hi, Beaver.

40:49.252 --> 40:50.319
Beav...

40:51.120 --> 40:52.554
Wait up.

40:56.125 --> 40:59.895
- How about we go upstairs?
- What's upstairs?

40:59.929 --> 41:01.196
Your room.

41:01.231 --> 41:04.099
I know that.
But why you wanna go...

41:04.133 --> 41:06.001
Oh, my God.

41:14.043 --> 41:16.945
Yeah, they turn off the
Slushee machines at midnight.

41:16.980 --> 41:19.181
Actually, I was thinking
we could exchange our gifts.

41:19.215 --> 41:22.050
- Here?
- No better time than the present.

41:22.085 --> 41:23.218
Present. Get it?

41:24.354 --> 41:26.922
- OK. Me first.
- OK.

41:32.262 --> 41:33.629
"Look up."

41:38.167 --> 41:39.368
Just what I always wanted.

41:40.770 --> 41:42.004
You were so right.

41:42.038 --> 41:43.839
It's really hard
to buy a gift.

41:43.873 --> 41:45.841
And I totally cracked
under the pressure.

41:45.875 --> 41:47.509
You are off the hook
from this day forward.

41:47.544 --> 41:49.778
Well, that's good.

41:49.812 --> 41:52.648
Because I don't think I could
top what I did this year.

41:52.682 --> 41:55.284
Bringing me to the
Quickie Mart?

41:55.318 --> 41:57.019
It's not just
any Quickie Mart.

41:57.053 --> 41:59.855
You and I came here once
freshman year for snacks.

41:59.889 --> 42:01.890
I thought
it looked familiar.

42:01.925 --> 42:05.327
You were buying all this
food, and I was wondering

42:05.361 --> 42:07.162
if you got high
when I wasn't looking.

42:07.196 --> 42:10.265
And when I asked you
about it, you said:

42:10.300 --> 42:12.200
"I want to stock
the fridge in your room,"

42:12.235 --> 42:15.003
because you knew I was lazy
about going to the cafeteria,

42:15.038 --> 42:17.205
and you didn't
want me to go hungry.

42:17.240 --> 42:19.308
Um...
Do you want food?

42:19.342 --> 42:21.343
And you were at the
register, paying.

42:21.377 --> 42:24.613
And you tucked your hair
behind your ear,

42:24.647 --> 42:28.750
looked back at me
and just...

42:28.785 --> 42:30.652
...smiled.

42:33.056 --> 42:35.123
Case...

42:35.158 --> 42:38.894
This is where I first
realized that I loved you.

42:38.928 --> 42:41.930
And I've loved you
every day since.

42:41.965 --> 42:43.999
Oh, Cap...

42:45.902 --> 42:48.770
- Oh, my God.
- That's my gift.

42:48.805 --> 42:50.839
Oh, my God.
It's perfect.

42:58.648 --> 43:00.816
So, I um...

43:00.850 --> 43:01.917
I guess I kinda won?

43:01.951 --> 43:04.086
Yeah, you so won.

43:09.492 --> 43:10.626
Yes!

43:10.660 --> 43:13.462
Suck it,
Valentine's Day!
