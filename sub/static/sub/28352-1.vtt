WEBVTT

04:31.583 --> 04:33.083
[in Twi] So...

04:34.208 --> 04:36.417
If you had the chance
to go to any big city,

04:36.500 --> 04:38.625
where would you go?

04:41.042 --> 04:43.083
I don’t know.

04:45.875 --> 04:49.583
Accra, Kumasi, Takoradi,
anywhere.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.458
I don’t want to go anywhere.

04:54.542 --> 04:56.958
I like it here.

04:57.917 --> 05:01.792
So you don’t mind seeing the
same thing everyday?

05:02.167 --> 05:03.125
[Esi] No.

05:03.917 --> 05:05.667
And you?

05:08.417 --> 05:09.417
Sometimes.

05:10.792 --> 05:13.417
So you are going to leave me?

05:13.500 --> 05:16.042
Why would you say such a thing?

05:16.833 --> 05:18.458
I’m never going to leave you.

05:19.875 --> 05:24.125
If you leave me, I'm going to
turn into the wind,

05:24.208 --> 05:27.875
disappear into thin air
and find you.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.708
You don’t have to turn into the
wind and go anywhere.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.333
I won’t leave you.

05:35.333 --> 05:36.667
I promise you.

05:43.208 --> 05:47.375
Sit down and lets go home.
Your mother is waiting.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.875
[in Twi] I’m leaving.

07:20.667 --> 07:22.458
[Ama in Twi] What do you think?

07:25.333 --> 07:28.000
We can sell the things
we don't need.

07:28.417 --> 07:30.000
Your outboard motor.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.167
I think we can get a lot of
money if we sold it.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.292
[Kojo] You want me to sell my
outboard motor?

07:35.375 --> 07:38.292
Why don't you sell your
sewing machine?

07:38.375 --> 07:40.375
But you know this is
what feeds us.

07:40.458 --> 07:43.125
[Kojo] So I don't contribute anything?

07:51.417 --> 07:54.250
I won't sell anything of mine to
move to the big city.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.208
My mind is made up.

08:48.417 --> 08:49.417
Please... No.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.292
I am trusting you.
Take care of it.

10:40.167 --> 10:41.875
Ama.
Ama, wake up.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.542
Ama. Where is her medicine?

12:06.583 --> 12:08.208
[Kojo] So how is mother?

12:13.333 --> 12:14.833
That’s why I’m here.

12:17.417 --> 12:18.708
She’s not well.

12:20.292 --> 12:21.708
What’s wrong with your food?

12:22.167 --> 12:23.542
I don’t want fufu.

12:23.625 --> 12:25.208
I want rice.

12:33.542 --> 12:34.667
Here you go.

12:35.208 --> 12:36.375
Kwabena... No.

12:48.958 --> 12:51.208
Buy whatever you want.

13:45.792 --> 13:49.083
[in Twi] The Crow is here to
capture the Sacred Bird.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.458
Don’t let him take it.

14:06.125 --> 14:08.250
[Kwabena]  I'll be waiting
for you in the big city.

18:52.917 --> 18:54.375
[in Twi] This place has changed.

18:54.458 --> 18:56.917
This is where the old filling
station used to be.

18:58.083 --> 18:59.250
That’s moved too?

18:59.583 --> 19:00.417
Oh, long time.

19:08.500 --> 19:09.875
[Kwabena]
You see those Chinese men?

19:11.333 --> 19:12.792
They run things now.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.750
Everywhere you go,
they are there.

21:04.583 --> 21:06.958
Ama wake up. I have
something to tell you.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.833
Wake up.

21:53.375 --> 21:54.625
[Kwabena in Twi]
You are here already.

21:55.875 --> 21:57.958
So you finally told her
what happened.

22:16.958 --> 22:18.500
Can you believe it?

22:20.625 --> 22:22.542
It’s been 7 years.

22:27.708 --> 22:30.333
I’m sure that I’m the luckiest
person right now.

22:34.083 --> 22:39.542
Celebrating my wedding and funeral
anniversary on the same day.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.250
I forgot.

23:03.333 --> 23:05.708
You don't drink anymore.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.667
Well, I’ll drink for us.

24:03.458 --> 24:06.250
[Esi in Twi] So Alejandro and
Jose are brothers?

24:07.000 --> 24:07.917
[Esi's Grandma] Yes.

24:14.042 --> 24:16.417
[Esi] So why are they fighting?

24:17.208 --> 24:20.375
[Esi's Grandma] Sometimes brothers
fight each other.

24:46.458 --> 24:51.792
[in Twi] So when my father and uncle
were children did they fight?

24:52.042 --> 24:53.333
A lot...

24:53.833 --> 24:55.500
When they were children.

24:55.583 --> 24:57.875
One day, if I didn’t arrive early,

24:57.958 --> 25:01.000
your uncle would have
drowned your father.

25:11.125 --> 25:14.708
[in Twi] So will Alejandro and Jose
stop fighting one day?

25:15.083 --> 25:17.375
I don’t think so.

25:18.333 --> 25:19.208
Why?

25:20.583 --> 25:25.167
Because they both love
the same woman.

25:28.292 --> 25:30.917
Oh, really?

25:44.792 --> 25:47.625
[in Twi]
Remember where I used to work?

25:50.417 --> 25:51.417
Altra Gold?

25:54.375 --> 25:56.792
I heard they stopped
work a long time ago.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.083
It's true.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.250
But...

26:03.500 --> 26:05.667
Before they closed down,

26:06.333 --> 26:08.000
they found gold.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.042
They found a lot of gold.

26:10.458 --> 26:13.458
But they couldn't get all of it
before the company closed down.

26:13.542 --> 26:20.042
So, if you're interested
we can go try there.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.375
Altra Gold... right now?

26:27.417 --> 26:29.958
It sounds dangerous.

26:30.458 --> 26:33.542
I don’t think it's
going to help me.

26:34.875 --> 26:39.667
I'm just looking for something
small to get back on my feet.

26:39.750 --> 26:41.875
Not Altra Gold.

26:48.083 --> 26:54.583
It's just an idea. If you're
not interested, no problem.

27:01.583 --> 27:04.417
How many guys work for Apalu?

27:05.750 --> 27:07.250
Apalu?

27:09.708 --> 27:13.667
You can find him at
his usual place.

27:14.250 --> 27:15.833
Sisi’s Bar?

28:35.708 --> 28:38.083
[in Twi] To tell you the truth,

28:38.417 --> 28:44.667
since you left, no one
has found much gold.

28:45.042 --> 28:49.042
The chiefs have
sold all the land,

28:49.125 --> 28:53.833
and the Chinese have brought
their heavy duty machines.

28:53.917 --> 28:56.500
We can’t compete with them.

28:56.833 --> 28:59.958
All the polluted rivers
you hear about...

29:00.042 --> 29:01.667
It's them.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.458
[Esi in Twi] Father I swear,

30:07.542 --> 30:09.875
the crow came here.

30:09.958 --> 30:11.500
If we don't move,

30:11.583 --> 30:13.750
it will come back to find us.

30:15.125 --> 30:16.583
[Kojo] I don't believe you.

30:16.667 --> 30:18.833
It's just your wild imagination.

30:37.625 --> 30:38.542
I've found some.

30:38.625 --> 30:39.792
You found some?

30:39.875 --> 30:42.000
True. True.
Here it is.

30:42.375 --> 30:43.292
Here it is.

30:51.167 --> 30:53.917
[in Arabic] The goods
haven't arrived yet.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.333
What's the reason?

30:57.500 --> 30:59.083
That’s not acceptable.

30:59.333 --> 31:01.417
I owe people money.

31:01.500 --> 31:04.250
I have a deal to close.

31:05.542 --> 31:06.375
True.

31:07.958 --> 31:12.000
You have to finalize this operation
the best way possible, okay?

31:12.958 --> 31:14.375
Wait a minute.

31:20.917 --> 31:23.083
[in Arabic] Finalize this operation
and let's see what we can do.

31:25.042 --> 31:27.000
[in Arabic] Hold on...

31:30.875 --> 31:32.500
We need to finalize.

31:39.625 --> 31:41.875
[man continues in Arabic]
Let's see what happens.

31:45.958 --> 31:49.500
Let's finish, by all means,
and finalize.

31:51.667 --> 31:53.667
Let's settle it.

31:56.750 --> 31:58.750
Let's settle it.

32:09.292 --> 32:11.417
[in Twi] I told you, that’s
how much they pay.

32:16.583 --> 32:20.792
That money is for me, you and
the rest of the boys to share.

32:21.625 --> 32:23.750
That’s the price these days.

32:26.292 --> 32:31.083
So why did you come to the
village to find me?

32:35.583 --> 32:37.250
No reason.

32:38.417 --> 32:39.917
I missed my little brother.

32:42.250 --> 32:44.792
You’ve been gone too long,
brother.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.292
You’ve been gone
for far too long.

32:48.250 --> 32:50.875
Forget about everything that
happened and move forward.

32:50.958 --> 32:53.708
I moved forward.
I moved forward.

32:53.792 --> 32:56.750
You coming back has brought
my mind back to it.

32:59.333 --> 33:01.167
You haven’t moved forward.

33:01.792 --> 33:03.750
You’ve been hiding.

33:04.125 --> 33:05.958
Hiding and moving forward,

33:06.042 --> 33:08.417
There is a difference.
It’s not the same thing.

33:10.625 --> 33:11.917
Kwabena...

33:12.292 --> 33:15.208
Whatever happened, you should
be able to forgive me.

33:15.292 --> 33:19.000
Not a day goes by that
I don’t think about it.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.542
Brother forget about it.

33:23.625 --> 33:26.292
I won’t forget about it.
I have to say it.

33:26.583 --> 33:29.292
I know what happened
wasn’t right but...

33:31.792 --> 33:33.875
So right now what are
you going to do?

33:34.625 --> 33:36.625
I think about it too.

33:37.458 --> 33:40.375
But what are we going to do?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.292
The person is dead and gone.

33:43.917 --> 33:47.542
There is nothing you can say to
bring her back to life.

33:48.333 --> 33:49.500
You see?

33:50.333 --> 33:53.667
So forget about it and
move forward.

33:55.750 --> 33:58.583
As for us...

33:58.667 --> 34:01.292
We are waiting for you

34:01.667 --> 34:03.625
to come and join us.

34:32.458 --> 34:33.750
[Kojo] I told you,

34:33.833 --> 34:37.000
I don't believe in those
spiritual things.

34:39.375 --> 34:42.792
[Ama] Your mother said the
pastor has healing powers.

34:42.875 --> 34:45.917
What's the harm in trying?

34:47.542 --> 34:49.875
My mother is old.

34:50.375 --> 34:54.375
If you told her to sit in church
all day, she would.

34:55.042 --> 34:57.458
Otherwise she just watches telenovelas.

34:58.708 --> 35:00.542
I will take her.

35:00.625 --> 35:03.833
You can join us if you like.

35:58.125 --> 35:59.625
[all together] Amen.

35:59.708 --> 36:02.708
[in Twi] We are going to talk
a little about Joseph.

36:05.750 --> 36:10.042
[Pastor in Twi] There's a message
in it that can transform your life.

36:10.125 --> 36:11.333
If your relatives reject you,

36:11.417 --> 36:12.917
and the world turns
it's back on you,

36:13.000 --> 36:14.792
The one true God
will be with you.

36:15.792 --> 36:17.250
-Will be with you.
-[all] Amen.

36:17.583 --> 36:19.500
-Will be with you.
-[all] Amen.

36:20.417 --> 36:27.042
24. They took him and
put him in a hole.

36:27.125 --> 36:31.458
The hole was deep but
there was no water in it.

36:31.542 --> 36:35.083
And they sat down to eat.

36:38.958 --> 36:43.583
There were some
travelers passing by.

36:44.125 --> 36:48.708
And when they got to
where the brothers were,

36:49.792 --> 36:52.375
they had a sheep
they wanted to sell.

36:52.458 --> 36:54.042
I mean Joseph.

36:54.125 --> 36:57.333
So they took Joseph out of the
hole and sold him

36:57.583 --> 37:02.083
to be a slave in another land.
Beloved, listen.

37:02.167 --> 37:04.833
You will not be a slave till the end.

38:17.708 --> 38:21.333
[Pastor in Twi] To be a slave in
another land. Beloved, listen.

38:21.417 --> 38:22.875
You will not be a
slave till the end.

39:06.625 --> 39:09.792
[in Twi] I think it was the Crow.

39:12.292 --> 39:13.958
The Crow?

39:14.042 --> 39:17.833
The Crow is who killed the
Sacred Bird.

39:20.667 --> 39:23.750
What do you think the Crow
really wants?

39:24.708 --> 39:26.417
I don’t know.

39:29.625 --> 39:36.458
When you find out what the Crow
wants, come and tell me.

39:42.250 --> 39:44.250
Don't touch that cockroach.

40:14.292 --> 40:16.042
-[in Twi] Really?
-Yes.

40:17.708 --> 40:20.917
Why didn't they test it
before they took it?

40:21.000 --> 40:22.292
I tell you...

40:22.375 --> 40:25.333
Almost 100 thousand U.S. dollars.

40:25.417 --> 40:29.333
They exchanged for
the fake gold.

40:29.417 --> 40:32.833
And you know why they
couldn't go to the Police?

40:32.917 --> 40:36.583
Because they didn't have a
mining license.

40:44.917 --> 40:47.583
These white people are
not smart at all.

40:48.708 --> 40:50.208
It's surprising.

41:36.250 --> 41:37.250
[Kojo in Twi] Now what?

41:37.625 --> 41:38.875
[Kwabena] Forget Apalu.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.583
He's a coward. Don't mind him.

41:41.667 --> 41:43.333
What he's saying is true.

41:43.417 --> 41:45.375
I don't think it's a good
idea to go back.

41:50.875 --> 41:53.417
This is our last chance
to go to Altra Gold.

41:55.750 --> 41:57.625
Our last chance.

41:57.875 --> 42:02.333
I already told you, Altra Gold
is too dangerous.

42:05.125 --> 42:06.333
Look...

42:06.583 --> 42:08.292
What are you afraid of?

42:08.375 --> 42:11.250
If we go and find gold... fine.

42:11.875 --> 42:16.000
If we don't find any... we don't
lose anything.

42:20.292 --> 42:22.125
It's dangerous.

42:22.208 --> 42:23.583
It doesn't matter.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.500
If you're brave you
will find some.

42:27.167 --> 42:29.333
I know there's gold there.

42:41.542 --> 42:43.208
I'll think about it.

42:43.292 --> 42:45.583
You’ll think about it?

43:09.375 --> 43:13.125
When you think about it...
Remember.

47:16.667 --> 47:19.000
[in Twi] How deep do you think it is?

47:21.542 --> 47:22.625
I don't know.

47:25.667 --> 47:26.708
Did you bring a rope?

47:31.125 --> 47:32.458
Please, Kwabena.

47:33.583 --> 47:35.458
Please, Kwabena.
Please, help me.

50:36.250 --> 50:38.250
[in Twi] I will call you later.

50:38.833 --> 50:39.792
I will call you.

50:47.792 --> 50:51.333
[in Twi] We will send a
search party to find him.

50:51.417 --> 50:53.375
But it's very difficult work.

51:01.375 --> 51:07.250
We have to motivate the boys.

51:07.333 --> 51:08.333
You understand?

51:12.000 --> 51:14.292
You have something small?

51:16.375 --> 51:19.083
Sir, I don't have any money.

51:19.167 --> 51:20.125
Bring your voice down.

51:20.208 --> 51:21.875
Why...

51:21.958 --> 51:24.417
Why are you being so loud? Hmm?

51:31.792 --> 51:34.833
You don't have anything...
small?

51:34.917 --> 51:37.375
I don't have anything, Sir.

51:37.792 --> 51:38.625
Really?

51:38.708 --> 51:40.417
I don't have anything.

52:01.250 --> 52:05.167
[woman on TV in Twi]
<i>We just heard from our reporter</i>

52:05.250 --> 52:08.000
<i>about the illegal miner</i>
<i>who went missing.</i>

52:08.083 --> 52:10.083
<i>The sad news is that</i>

52:10.375 --> 52:12.042
<i>by the time they found him,</i>

52:12.125 --> 52:13.375
<i>He was dead.</i>

54:27.708 --> 54:30.667
[in Twi] No... I can’t die here.

1:01:17.042 --> 1:01:18.250
Uncle Kwabena...

1:01:18.333 --> 1:01:20.458
[in Twi] Are you the Crow?

1:01:21.292 --> 1:01:24.583
I am whatever your
mind tells you I am.

1:01:27.750 --> 1:01:30.458
Where are you hiding my father?

1:01:31.083 --> 1:01:34.042
Your father is where he
has always been.

1:01:34.667 --> 1:01:36.792
Where people who
suffer from guilt are.

1:01:40.667 --> 1:01:42.667
Me and Adwoa had an accident.

1:01:43.417 --> 1:01:45.458
I said, where are you
hiding my father?

1:01:47.292 --> 1:01:51.167
Me and Adwoa had an accident
on the day of my wedding.

1:01:52.667 --> 1:01:54.708
That night we died.

1:01:54.792 --> 1:01:56.833
Your father was
supposed to die too.

1:01:58.083 --> 1:01:59.833
But he lived.

1:02:00.750 --> 1:02:03.792
We have waited for
him for a while.

1:02:03.875 --> 1:02:07.917
We are now at the land
where the sky meets the earth,

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:11.208
and people walk upside down.

1:02:11.292 --> 1:02:13.208
If your father is not with us,

1:02:13.292 --> 1:02:15.625
we can’t cross into
the afterlife.

1:02:16.958 --> 1:02:18.542
So right now we are
waiting for him.

1:02:18.625 --> 1:02:21.958
We are waiting for your father
to come and join us.

1:02:24.125 --> 1:02:27.208
So if you are dead,
how are you alive?

1:02:28.042 --> 1:02:29.667
I am dead.

1:02:30.375 --> 1:02:32.458
But in your father's
mind, I am still alive.

1:02:32.542 --> 1:02:35.792
But the truth is, I am
not among the living.

1:02:35.875 --> 1:02:39.375
Your father jumped into
the mine all by himself.

1:02:41.833 --> 1:02:43.375
What mine?

1:02:49.167 --> 1:02:50.792
I can’t tell you.

1:02:52.333 --> 1:02:56.375
But if you want to
save your father,

1:02:56.458 --> 1:02:58.708
then time is running out.

1:02:58.792 --> 1:03:03.333
You will have to hurry up
because you don’t have time.

1:03:03.792 --> 1:03:05.917
Where is the Sacred Bird?

1:06:53.333 --> 1:06:54.333
Father!

1:08:36.750 --> 1:08:37.750
[in Twi] Father,

1:08:38.375 --> 1:08:41.583
I know what the Crow wants.

1:08:41.667 --> 1:08:48.042
He wants you to come
and join him.

1:08:48.125 --> 1:08:50.208
Don't go.

1:08:50.458 --> 1:08:52.208
Father don't go.

1:08:52.750 --> 1:08:55.667
Father don't go.

1:08:56.458 --> 1:08:58.167
Don't go.

1:08:59.583 --> 1:09:01.167
Don't go.
