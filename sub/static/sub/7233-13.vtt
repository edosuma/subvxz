[THEME -- STUART KOLLMORGEN]

00:00.930 --> 00:01.630
(SINGING) Let's go!

00:01.630 --> 00:02.330
Peter Rabbit.

00:02.330 --> 00:03.170
Go on a run.

00:03.170 --> 00:05.680
Run for our lives.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.760
We'll tear a hole in every
fence and every wall.

00:08.760 --> 00:09.550
Peter Rabbit.

00:09.550 --> 00:11.150
Run through the fields.

00:11.150 --> 00:15.490
Run wild and free, and grab
a piece of every radish

00:15.490 --> 00:16.360
that we see.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.350
Peter Rabbit.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.830
Go day and night.

00:18.830 --> 00:20.800
Go for it all.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.280
It's time to fly.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.760
Come on, the wind's
begun to blow!

00:23.760 --> 00:24.740
Let's go.

00:24.740 --> 00:27.700
Because you and I, we
weren't made for going slow.

00:27.700 --> 00:28.480
Let's go!

00:28.480 --> 00:29.180
Adventure calls.

00:29.180 --> 00:30.450
The game is on, come on!

00:30.450 --> 00:31.150
Let's go!

00:31.150 --> 00:32.140
Peter Rabbit.

00:32.140 --> 00:33.120
Let's go!

00:33.120 --> 00:34.390
Peter Rabbit!

00:34.390 --> 00:35.090
Let's go!

00:35.090 --> 00:36.370
Peter Rabbit.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.070
Let's go!

00:41.010 --> 00:43.520
PETER RABBIT: The Tale of
the Lucky Four Leaf Clover.

00:46.390 --> 00:47.090
Oof.

00:52.810 --> 00:53.630
Whoa!

00:53.630 --> 00:54.330
Whoa.

00:54.330 --> 00:55.450
LILY: Careful, Peter.

00:55.450 --> 01:00.680
PETER RABBIT: Just
a little more, and--

01:00.680 --> 01:01.380
whoa!

01:01.380 --> 01:02.080
Oh.

01:02.080 --> 01:02.890
BENJAMIN: Uh oh.

01:02.890 --> 01:04.060
I hope nothing's broken.

01:04.060 --> 01:05.080
PETER RABBIT: Relax, Benjamin.

01:05.080 --> 01:05.780
I'm fine.

01:05.780 --> 01:10.560
BENJAMIN: Not you, my dad's
new springy apple grabber.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.390
Phew.

01:11.390 --> 01:12.950
Still works.

01:12.950 --> 01:14.070
Thank goodness.

01:14.070 --> 01:15.640
PETER RABBIT: I'm
not giving up yet.

01:19.870 --> 01:20.810
Almost there.

01:20.810 --> 01:21.850
LILY: Careful, Peter.

01:21.850 --> 01:25.250
You don't want to knock
down too many-- ow!

01:25.250 --> 01:26.720
Oh no!

01:26.720 --> 01:29.030
BENJAMIN: What is it?

01:29.030 --> 01:29.730
Wah!

01:29.730 --> 01:34.030
LILY: It's my magnifying
glass, but it's OK.

01:34.030 --> 01:35.200
It's not broken.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.250
PETER RABBIT: Sorry
about that, Lily.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.750
Uh, at least there's
plenty to eat for everyone.

01:39.750 --> 01:42.050
MR. TOD: Plenty to eat, indeed.

01:42.050 --> 01:42.860
PETER RABBIT: Mr. Tod!

01:42.860 --> 01:45.250
MR. TOD: And I'm
not talking apples.

01:45.250 --> 01:49.450
Roast rabbit with all the
trimmings for dinner tonight.

01:49.450 --> 01:50.610
Delicious.

01:50.610 --> 01:51.550
PETER RABBIT: Split up!

01:55.509 --> 01:57.990
BENJAMIN: Whoa!

01:57.990 --> 01:58.979
MR. TOD: Stop!

01:58.979 --> 02:01.460
Wait!

02:01.460 --> 02:05.800
Why can't you all
run the same way?

02:05.800 --> 02:09.050
Well, I could catch
you if I wanted to.

02:09.050 --> 02:13.470
I just find running
so undignified.

02:13.470 --> 02:15.740
Hmm.

02:15.740 --> 02:18.079
What's this?

02:18.079 --> 02:19.500
Could come in handy.

02:19.500 --> 02:23.820
Oh well, not a completely
wasted morning then.

02:23.820 --> 02:26.410
PETER RABBIT:
Everyone all right?

02:26.410 --> 02:30.100
LILY: My magnifying glass,
I must've dropped it!

02:36.890 --> 02:40.060
MR. TOD: And all the better
to spot rabbits with.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.640
LILY: How could I
have been so clumsy?

02:46.640 --> 02:51.420
Oh, I'll never see my
magnifying glass again.

02:51.420 --> 02:52.610
BENJAMIN: Look, look, look.

02:52.610 --> 02:53.600
Look what I found.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.370
A clover!

02:54.370 --> 02:58.790
And it's not just any
clover, a four leaf clover!

02:58.790 --> 03:01.310
This must be my lucky day.

03:01.310 --> 03:03.850
LILY: A four leaf clover, huh?

03:03.850 --> 03:07.420
Also known as a common
perennial herbaceous trifolium.

03:07.420 --> 03:10.000
BENJAMIN: Uh, yeah.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.760
What you said.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.960
But they're really
lucky, aren't they?

03:13.960 --> 03:16.990
LILY: Well, there's
no scientific proof

03:16.990 --> 03:18.630
that they're lucky, Benjamin.

03:18.630 --> 03:20.110
PETER RABBIT: She's right.

03:20.110 --> 03:22.030
There's no such thing
as a lucky clover.

03:22.030 --> 03:22.840
What?

03:22.840 --> 03:24.370
There has to be.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.180
I'm sure it's lucky.

03:26.180 --> 03:28.840
And after everything
that's happened,

03:28.840 --> 03:30.690
we could really
use some good luck.

03:34.550 --> 03:39.880
LILY: My precious magnifying
glass, gone forever.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.310
BENJAMIN: Well, that would
never have happened if you've

03:42.310 --> 03:43.790
had a lucky four leaf clover.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.130
PETER RABBIT: Do you really
believe that little leaf

03:46.130 --> 03:47.270
can bring you good luck?

03:47.270 --> 03:49.960
BENJAMIN: Of course.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.560
Hear that?

03:51.560 --> 03:53.360
Oh, I'm so hungry.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.730
If only I had some
tasty turnips,

03:55.730 --> 03:58.670
or berries, or carrots.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.520
Yes, carrots.

04:00.520 --> 04:03.990
Then I'll be the luckiest
rabbit in the whole world.

04:03.990 --> 04:05.790
PETER RABBIT: Hungry, huh?

04:05.790 --> 04:08.280
Time to play a little
trick on Benjamin.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.760
Uh, Lily, tell us some
more about clovers.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.900
It's really fascinating.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.500
LILY: Really?

04:15.500 --> 04:16.620
OK.

04:16.620 --> 04:18.959
We could start by
having a closer

04:18.959 --> 04:22.680
look at Benjamin's clover
through my magnifying glass--

04:22.680 --> 04:25.910
[SIGH] if I had it.

04:25.910 --> 04:32.280
Well, I suppose we could look
at some sketches instead.

04:32.280 --> 04:35.659
There are about 300
different types of clover.

04:49.380 --> 04:52.780
PETER RABBIT: This
ought to trick Benjamin.

04:52.780 --> 04:56.780
LILY: And the honeybees get
their nectar from clover

04:56.780 --> 04:58.150
to make their honey.

04:58.150 --> 05:00.650
BENJAMIN: Hmm, honey.

05:00.650 --> 05:02.330
Honey with carrots.

05:02.330 --> 05:05.640
Oh, it's making me hungry again.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.850
And there goes my tummy alarm.

05:07.850 --> 05:10.580
I'm taking my four
leaf clover and going

05:10.580 --> 05:12.670
home to get something to eat.

05:12.670 --> 05:17.860
PETER RABBIT: 3, 2, 1.

05:17.860 --> 05:18.770
BENJAMIN: Wow!

05:18.770 --> 05:22.070
LILY: Now what?

05:22.070 --> 05:24.230
Where did those come from?

05:24.230 --> 05:27.420
BENJAMIN: My lucky four
leaf clover, of course.

05:27.420 --> 05:31.220
As long as I have this,
I'll always have good luck.

05:31.220 --> 05:36.230
LILY: It can't really be
the clover leaf, can it?

05:36.230 --> 05:38.780
NUTKIN: Hi ho, bunny buddies!

05:38.780 --> 05:41.130
Who's for a game a
pine cone bowling?

05:41.130 --> 05:42.970
BENJAMIN: Not me.

05:42.970 --> 05:44.080
I never win.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.150
PETER RABBIT: Never
say never, Benjamin.

05:46.150 --> 05:47.890
Now you have your
four leaf clover.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.480
Here's a chance
to prove how lucky

05:49.480 --> 05:53.530
it really is with a little
bit of help from me.

05:53.530 --> 05:55.330
BENJAMIN: Peter, you're right!

05:55.330 --> 05:56.420
OK, Nutkin.

05:56.420 --> 05:57.990
Count me in.

05:57.990 --> 05:58.690
Let's play.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.260
NUTKIN: All right, Benjamin.

06:03.260 --> 06:04.730
Give it your best shot.

06:04.730 --> 06:06.590
PETER RABBIT: Time
for another trick.

06:06.590 --> 06:11.290
BENJAMIN: Ready, aim, swing.

06:11.290 --> 06:11.990
And--

06:11.990 --> 06:13.400
PETER RABBIT: Look over there!

06:13.400 --> 06:14.350
In the bushes.

06:14.350 --> 06:15.050
BENJAMIN: Where?

06:15.050 --> 06:17.860
NUTKIN: I don't see anything.

06:17.860 --> 06:19.340
PETER RABBIT: Oh, sorry.

06:19.340 --> 06:21.510
I thought I saw something.

06:21.510 --> 06:22.410
BENJAMIN: Wow!

06:22.410 --> 06:23.760
Look at that!

06:23.760 --> 06:25.070
A perfect strike.

06:25.070 --> 06:27.810
I've never done that before.

06:27.810 --> 06:30.980
NUTKIN: I'm seeing it,
but I'm not believing it.

06:30.980 --> 06:33.050
PETER RABBIT: You
scattered every last one.

06:33.050 --> 06:35.210
LILY: Well done, Benjamin.

06:35.210 --> 06:37.659
BENJAMIN: It must have
been the lucky clover.

06:37.659 --> 06:39.440
Now do you believe me?

06:39.440 --> 06:41.610
I'm the luckiest rabbit ever.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.510
LILY: Maybe it really does work.

06:44.510 --> 06:45.450
BENJAMIN: Yes!

06:45.450 --> 06:46.850
[MUSIC PLAYING]

06:46.850 --> 06:49.190
(SINGING) Play, rabbit, play.

06:49.190 --> 06:51.430
Let's hop to an
adventure on the way.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.540
Play, rabbit, play.

06:56.540 --> 06:57.380
Across the fields.

06:57.380 --> 06:59.960
Come on now, what do you say?

06:59.960 --> 07:01.440
BENJAMIN: Yes!

07:01.440 --> 07:03.280
[MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING)
The sun is blazing.

07:03.280 --> 07:09.600
The light's amazing, and
everything is fresh and new.

07:09.600 --> 07:13.320
Play, rabbit, play.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.390
BENJAMIN: Mmm, yum.

07:17.190 --> 07:20.010
MR. TOD: What ripping fun.

07:20.010 --> 07:22.720
I'm so glad I found
this marvellous new toy.

07:27.320 --> 07:31.350
LILY: Benjamin, I need to borrow
your lucky four leaf clover.

07:31.350 --> 07:33.940
BENJAMIN: I thought you
didn't believe it was lucky.

07:33.940 --> 07:38.230
LILY: Yes, well after
all the amazing things

07:38.230 --> 07:40.980
that have happened to you
today, I have to believe it now.

07:40.980 --> 07:42.340
BENJAMIN: Exactly.

07:42.340 --> 07:44.710
You can't argue with the facts.

07:44.710 --> 07:49.480
LILY: So if you could just
lend me your lucky clover,

07:49.480 --> 07:53.360
I'm going to get my magnifying
glass back for Mr. Tod.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.430
BENJAMIN: (GULPING) Mr. Tod?

07:55.430 --> 07:56.480
Are you sure, Lily?

07:56.480 --> 07:59.170
LILY: Of course I'm sure.

07:59.170 --> 08:01.420
With your lucky
four leaf clover,

08:01.420 --> 08:03.820
I'll be perfectly
safe with Mr. Tod.

08:09.780 --> 08:14.190
MR. TOD: Isn't this the part
where you sort of run away?

08:14.190 --> 08:16.500
LILY: Not this time, Mr. Tod.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.240
I've been waiting for you.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.950
MR. TOD: Have you now?

08:19.950 --> 08:21.640
How intriguing.

08:21.640 --> 08:25.110
That roast rabbit with all the
trimmings is back on the menu.

08:25.110 --> 08:27.150
LILY: You can't harm me.

08:27.150 --> 08:31.500
I'm feeling lucky today
because I have this.

08:31.500 --> 08:35.840
MR. TOD: A lucky
four leaf clover?

08:35.840 --> 08:36.690
Well, well.

08:36.690 --> 08:41.010
LILY: Now, give me back my
magnifying glass immediately,

08:41.010 --> 08:41.809
please.

08:41.809 --> 08:43.530
MR. TOD: Sorry, my dear.

08:43.530 --> 08:46.830
The only luck that clover
is going to bring you today

08:46.830 --> 08:48.720
is the bad kind.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.420
PETER RABBIT: Still enjoying
your lucky day, Benjamin?

08:51.420 --> 08:55.300
BENJAMIN: Yep, all thanks
to my lucky clover.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.970
PETER RABBIT: Where
is your lucky clover?

08:56.970 --> 08:58.830
BENJAMIN: Oh I lent
it to Lily, so she

08:58.830 --> 09:00.480
could use it to
get her magnifying

09:00.480 --> 09:01.920
glass back for Mr. Tod.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.530
PETER RABBIT: All right.

09:03.530 --> 09:05.400
Wait, what?

09:05.400 --> 09:06.890
She's gone to Mr. Tod?

09:06.890 --> 09:08.220
Oh no!

09:08.220 --> 09:09.690
BENJAMIN: What's wrong?

09:09.690 --> 09:12.240
Nothing's going to happen
to her, not while she's

09:12.240 --> 09:15.000
got my special lucky clover.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.180
MR. TOD: What a
scrumptious little rabbit.

09:18.180 --> 09:20.100
LILY: Florence, it's OK.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.810
We have the lucky clover.

09:21.810 --> 09:23.460
Come back.

09:23.460 --> 09:24.840
I'm warning you.

09:24.840 --> 09:28.230
I've got a lucky clover and
I'm not afraid to use it.

09:28.230 --> 09:33.090
MR. TOD: Now, what vegetables
to have with my main course?

09:33.090 --> 09:34.470
BENJAMIN: See, Peter?

09:34.470 --> 09:36.150
She's got my lucky clover.

09:36.150 --> 09:36.990
She's fine.

09:36.990 --> 09:39.190
PETER RABBIT: No,
you don't understand.

09:39.190 --> 09:40.590
I tricked you, Benjamin.

09:40.590 --> 09:44.350
The carrots, the bowling, the
strawberries, even the fish--

09:44.350 --> 09:45.570
I did all that.

09:45.570 --> 09:47.250
That clover isn't lucky.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.090
It's just a leaf.

09:48.090 --> 09:51.180
BENJAMIN: Oh, I see.

09:51.180 --> 09:52.420
Wha-- what?

09:52.420 --> 09:53.760
PETER RABBIT: I'm sorry.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.680
I was just having a bit of fun.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.690
I didn't think it would
get anyone in trouble.

09:57.690 --> 10:01.490
BENJAMIN: Wait, but that means
I really am no good at bowling.

10:01.490 --> 10:03.540
PETER RABBIT: Oh,
forget bowling.

10:03.540 --> 10:04.680
Lily's in trouble.

10:04.680 --> 10:05.760
You stay here.

10:05.760 --> 10:09.490
This is my fault.
Leave her alone.

10:09.490 --> 10:11.320
MR. TOD: Excellent!

10:11.320 --> 10:12.730
Double helpings.

10:12.730 --> 10:15.190
LILY: Oh, I'm glad
you're here, Peter.

10:15.190 --> 10:17.470
Just in time to see
how lucky Benjamin's

10:17.470 --> 10:19.060
four leaf clover really is.

10:19.060 --> 10:20.620
PETER RABBIT: Oh, yes.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.700
About that, long story.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.690
It turns out that lucky clover
isn't so lucky after all.

10:25.690 --> 10:27.130
LILY: What?

10:27.130 --> 10:28.290
What do you mean?

10:28.290 --> 10:30.060
PETER RABBIT: I did
all those things.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.220
I was just playing
a trick on Benjamin.

10:32.220 --> 10:35.170
LILY: Oh no!

10:35.170 --> 10:38.360
MR. TOD: If you two
have quite finished,

10:38.360 --> 10:40.990
I do have plans for dinner.

10:40.990 --> 10:41.690
Ooh!

10:44.980 --> 10:45.930
PETER RABBIT: Wow!

10:45.930 --> 10:47.800
The lucky clover.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.020
I don't believe it.

10:49.020 --> 10:50.900
It really does work.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.260
BENJAMIN: Not exactly.

10:53.260 --> 10:55.500
But my dad's springy apple
grabber certainly does.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.990
[LAUGHTER]

10:56.990 --> 10:58.180
LILY: Brilliant.

10:58.180 --> 10:59.840
Great job, Benjamin.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.810
PETER RABBIT: You saved the day!

11:01.810 --> 11:02.950
You're a hero.

11:02.950 --> 11:06.190
LILY: Just shows you don't
need a lucky clover when you

11:06.190 --> 11:08.220
have a friend like Benjamin.

11:08.220 --> 11:09.650
PETER RABBIT: Sorry, Lily.

11:09.650 --> 11:10.990
Sorry, Benjamin.

11:10.990 --> 11:12.310
No more tricks.

11:12.310 --> 11:14.290
LILY: And no more lucky clovers.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.400
BENJAMIN: Oof, ow!

11:21.400 --> 11:24.850
What is this?

11:24.850 --> 11:27.400
A horseshoe, wow!

11:27.400 --> 11:30.120
They're supposed to bring
you really good luck.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.340
PETER AND LILY: Benjamin.

11:32.340 --> 11:34.220
BENJAMIN: Yeah, you're right.

11:34.220 --> 11:35.340
Maybe not.

11:35.340 --> 11:36.040
[GRUNT]

11:36.040 --> 11:39.040
[LAUGHTER]

11:39.040 --> 11:39.940
[THEME - STUART KOLLMORGEN]

11:39.940 --> 11:41.440
(SINGING) Peter Rabbit!

11:44.440 --> 11:45.340
Peter Rabbit!

11:51.940 --> 11:54.040
Peter Rabbit!

11:54.040 --> 11:55.840
Peter Rabbit.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.990
Peter Rabbit.
