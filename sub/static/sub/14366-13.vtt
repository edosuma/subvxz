00:04.163 --> 00:07.564
<i>Assembly of the Omega lock
is entering the final stage.</i>

00:07.567 --> 00:10.801
Megatron is preparing to cyber-form Earth.

00:10.803 --> 00:14.105
Autobots, lock on
to those coordinates.

00:14.107 --> 00:17.174
Spectrum analysis confirms
that the synthetic Energon is stable.

00:17.176 --> 00:19.410
But pity you won't live long

00:19.412 --> 00:22.213
enough to witness the
fruits of your labor.

00:22.215 --> 00:27.154
Your high and mighty leader
wanted your Predacons exterminated!

00:29.163 --> 00:35.026
And my only mistake was not
seeing the extermination through.

00:35.028 --> 00:38.162
<i>You should have faced me as a beast!</i>

00:38.564 --> 00:41.198
<i>Mobilize what remains of our forces.</i>

00:41.200 --> 00:45.970
This will be our last stand.

<i>The Omega lock's control
station is located on the lower deck.</i>

00:58.985 --> 00:59.984
Come on!

01:03.587 --> 01:05.396
I am making my way there now.

01:05.431 --> 01:08.881
<i>Copy, Ratchet.
We will rendezvous at the objective.</i>

01:08.898 --> 01:12.990
<i>Arcee, lead stealth team
to secure the Omega lock.</i>

01:12.998 --> 01:17.140
Ultra Magnus, you and the
Wreckers storm the bridge.

01:17.628 --> 01:20.762
<i>Prevent the Decepticons
from targeting the device </i>

01:20.771 --> 01:23.600
<i>if stealth team is delayed.</i>

01:25.773 --> 01:28.985
Optimus, if we fail to secure
the lock before it's ready

01:28.985 --> 01:33.573
- to deploy, do we destroy it?
- I do not intend to squander

01:33.573 --> 01:37.287
a second chance to restore Cybertron.

01:41.205 --> 01:44.628
- Wreckers.
- Bee, Smokescreen ... with me.

01:51.299 --> 01:52.759
<i>Smokescreen!</i>

02:55.180 --> 02:56.590
Go on without me.

02:58.450 --> 02:59.920
That isn't the mission.

03:01.370 --> 03:03.260
There's something I need to do.

03:23.620 --> 03:28.430
<i>Shut it down, Shockwave.
I cannot allow you to harm Earth.</i>

03:28.440 --> 03:32.790
The planet will not be harmed ...
only its indigenous life-forms.

03:32.910 --> 03:36.120
Over my sparkless husk.

03:52.350 --> 03:55.740
Ratchet, we're
approaching your position.

03:55.820 --> 03:58.010
- What?!
- Scrap.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.490
Attack!

04:03.510 --> 04:07.570
<i>Pack light. Pack light.
Ooh.</i>

04:08.580 --> 04:10.300
Pack smart.

04:22.070 --> 04:24.780
I was hoping you'd still be here.

04:29.410 --> 04:30.860
Secure the bridge!

04:47.320 --> 04:50.080
<i>Ultra Magnus to all units.
We will be delayed.</i>

04:50.150 --> 04:53.710
<i>Soundwave pulled one of
his relocation tricks.</i>

04:53.800 --> 04:56.470
Raf, can you get me
onto the warship's bridge?

04:56.470 --> 04:58.600
Sure, now that I have a fix on it.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.370
But you won't have a
chance against Soundwave.

05:01.370 --> 05:03.240
I will if I have backup.

05:10.390 --> 05:13.650
Lord Megatron, the Omega lock
is fueled and ready.

05:37.920 --> 05:42.980
Shockwave, commence
Omega lock firing sequence.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.740
Oh, scrap!

06:24.740 --> 06:27.010
Surprise.

06:30.290 --> 06:33.590
<i>Pick on someone your own size.</i>

06:44.600 --> 06:48.070
<i>- Raf, showtime!
- Are you sure about this, Jack? </i>

06:48.080 --> 06:51.340
<i>- Last time you crossed the streams ...
- Do it, Raf ... now!</i>

07:15.480 --> 07:18.500
<i>- Enjoy the shadow zone, dude.
- Come on.</i>

07:18.610 --> 07:21.980
We need to figure out how
to navigate this thing.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.500
Shockwave, prepare to fire the ...

07:45.500 --> 07:47.700
<i>What?!</i>

07:47.700 --> 07:52.970
<i>Whoa!</i>

07:52.980 --> 07:53.940
<i>Whoa!</i>

07:54.060 --> 07:57.310
<i>Dude, where'd you learn to drive?</i>

07:57.310 --> 08:00.590
<i>Special delivery.</i>

08:01.110 --> 08:03.630
That way, right?

08:22.490 --> 08:26.310
- Optimus! Catch!
- Smokescreen!

09:21.410 --> 09:25.970
Optimus, you must use the
Saber to destroy the Omega lock.

09:26.890 --> 09:30.050
<i>It is the only way to save Earth!</i>

09:32.010 --> 09:33.928
The Star Saber!

11:28.500 --> 11:32.680
Prepare to join your
scout in the Allspark.

11:32.978 --> 11:34.362
<i>Megatron!</i>

11:54.400 --> 11:59.660
You took my voice.
You will never rob anyone of anything

11:59.690 --> 12:01.075
ever again.

12:24.264 --> 12:26.760
Lord Megatron! No!

13:05.002 --> 13:10.470
- I will avenge you, master!
- Starscream! Do not be a fool!

13:10.470 --> 13:12.670
Curse you and your logic!

13:19.190 --> 13:22.850
- Bumblebee!
- Your voice...

13:22.850 --> 13:27.180
My voice? What are you ...
my voice!

13:27.190 --> 13:31.490
- Ratchet, I have my pipes back!
- Yes.

13:31.490 --> 13:36.230
- Yes, we noticed.
- The cyber matter...

13:36.230 --> 13:39.000
It is the only possible explanation.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.770
It would seem the old field
medic made good after all.

13:44.770 --> 13:47.740
Optimus Prime to all units.

13:47.740 --> 13:50.710
<i>Megatron is no more.</i>

13:53.440 --> 13:55.980
- Yes!
- Hooah!

13:55.980 --> 14:00.080
<i>Wreckers, a job well
done securing the bridge.</i>

14:00.090 --> 14:02.350
It wasn't us, sir.
The credit belongs to the

14:02.360 --> 14:05.260
- humans.
- Hoo-Yeah!

14:08.120 --> 14:10.460
<i>The Omega lock is under our control.</i>

14:10.460 --> 14:13.000
I propose that we put it to good use.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.630
Agreed, old friend. Ultra Magnus...

14:16.640 --> 14:19.890
<i>set course for Cybertron.</i>

14:19.920 --> 14:21.850
Hey, Raf, if you could tear

14:21.850 --> 14:23.640
yourself away from your
laptop for two seconds...

14:23.640 --> 14:26.280
grid yourself up here so we
can get to Cybertron already.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.150
Wait. Who's that?

14:31.225 --> 14:32.480
Bee?

14:57.626 --> 15:01.150
Your elbow articulator
is digging into my lateral flexor!

15:01.150 --> 15:04.820
Do you intend to whine for
the duration of the voyage?

15:08.250 --> 15:12.990
Optimus, I... was never able
to learn Shockwave's side of the

15:12.990 --> 15:16.960
cyber matter equation.
This may be all we ever have.

15:16.960 --> 15:20.000
And Cybertron is a much
larger planet than Earth.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.570
Then we must launch the cyber
matter at Cybertron's very core.

15:25.570 --> 15:29.340
Into the heart of Primus himself?

15:32.670 --> 15:38.250
<i>Commander, we've arrived.
At the Well of all Sparks.</i>

16:46.050 --> 16:48.990
<i>Ahh. Such luster.</i>

16:53.080 --> 16:56.360
What?
I'm joining the winning team.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.460
The Predacon.

17:45.010 --> 17:49.590
<i>Though our home world is
once again capable of supporting life...</i>

17:51.270 --> 17:55.490
<i>we have much rebuilding to do.</i>

17:55.490 --> 18:00.350
Alas, we will miss
our home away from home

18:00.420 --> 18:04.230
and the family we've made here.

18:06.600 --> 18:10.870
If 'Cons are still out there,
won't Earth be on their radar?

18:10.870 --> 18:15.210
Raf, if you ever need me,
need us for any reason, we're

18:15.210 --> 18:18.610
- just a space bridge away.
- Besides, we'll be in good

18:18.610 --> 18:22.180
hands with you, Jack, and Miko
continuing to serve Unit-E ...

18:22.180 --> 18:27.220
- In a semi-official capacity.
- Whoa! We are Agents?!

18:27.220 --> 18:29.690
Consultants. Until you're of age.

18:29.690 --> 18:33.380
I trust that Unit-E doesn't
have any rules forbidding the

18:33.430 --> 18:36.360
enlistment of rusty,
old Autobot consultants?

18:36.360 --> 18:40.130
- Ratchet? You of all ...
- Yep, yep, yep.

18:40.130 --> 18:42.170
I know where I am needed.

18:53.370 --> 18:57.260
- Raf...
- I know, Bee.

18:58.020 --> 19:00.180
You don't need to say anything.

19:02.930 --> 19:05.020
I never did.

19:20.580 --> 19:25.570
Miko, I guess this is...

19:44.560 --> 19:46.360
It's been quite a ride.

19:52.380 --> 19:54.570
Keep in touch, Jack.

19:58.590 --> 20:00.510
Don't make me hunt you down.

20:39.350 --> 20:42.640
Until we meet again, old friend.
