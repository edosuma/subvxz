00:24.492 --> 00:26.493
It's a form,
for crying out loud!

00:26.494 --> 00:29.929
What could be simpler? All you
have to do is fill in the blanks.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.198
What do I have to do,

00:31.199 --> 00:33.233
hire a nursemaid
to hold your hand,

00:33.234 --> 00:35.902
put ribbons in your hair?

00:35.903 --> 00:39.372

00:39.373 --> 00:42.409
If you want him down,
this is no huge problem.

00:42.410 --> 00:45.279
You should be able to fill
out a form correctly!

00:48.549 --> 00:51.784
Then I'll just have to
get somebody who can.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.788
I'm not gonna ask you again.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.259

01:30.391 --> 01:31.958
You said the what? The
interstate commerce commission?

01:31.959 --> 01:32.959
He didn't say that.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.395
Yes, he did.
Here. Hold this.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.863
Just tell them
don't shoot.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.865

gonna get weird.

01:41.835 --> 01:42.835

Got no gun.

I believe you.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.151
I just wanna
ask you a question.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.786
Now, you work for the interstate
commerce commission, right?

01:59.787 --> 02:02.389
No. They let me go.
They just threw me out.

02:02.390 --> 02:05.292
You, too?
They evicted me, too.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.893
I mean, they bought up
my whole apartment building

02:06.894 --> 02:10.229
so they could turn it
into a parking garage for...

02:10.231 --> 02:11.898

me what the hell that is?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.538
What is that?

02:18.539 --> 02:20.307
Don't work there anymore, and
they're on the second floor.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.774
But do you know
anybody I could talk to?

02:21.775 --> 02:23.176
Because I've been writing
and I've been phoning them.

02:23.177 --> 02:25.144

expressed outrage

upon viewing these tapes.

say the U.S. seventh fleet

reiterated their initial statement

07:12.866 --> 07:15.034
describing
the awacs crew's mission

07:15.035 --> 07:16.268
as a routine flight...

07:16.269 --> 07:17.537
Can you believe this?

that the negotiations...

your weapon.

when you leave.

And straight down
this hallway to the left.

09:43.216 --> 09:46.619
Puncture wounds
upper torso and base neck

09:46.620 --> 09:49.856
would be 5 to 8
centimeters across.

are progressing...

09:51.491 --> 09:52.491

09:52.492 --> 09:53.860

09:53.861 --> 09:56.462
Get in here
and take a look at this.

09:56.463 --> 09:59.498

She's a baby.

09:59.499 --> 10:03.335
Man, what is
the world coming to?

10:03.336 --> 10:04.336
What time she found?

10:04.337 --> 10:06.205
About 11:00.
Name?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.040
Carla town.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.675
Our best guess
is she's dead

10:08.676 --> 10:10.009
maybe 3 hours.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.443
Where's the first family?

10:11.444 --> 10:12.444
Camp David.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.314
Left yesterday
afternoon.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.917
So do you got an idea
what the murder weapon is?

10:17.918 --> 10:19.952
Well, it's not as clean
as a knife, reg.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.888
You see that jagged edge
on the wound there?

10:21.889 --> 10:23.723
It's not big enough
to be scissors,

10:23.724 --> 10:24.891
so I figure it must be
something smaller.

10:24.892 --> 10:28.194
Excuse me. All film
stays in house.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.696

10:29.697 --> 10:31.699
Whose orders,
tepper?

10:40.107 --> 10:42.574
Anyone know what she
was doing here so late?

10:42.575 --> 10:43.977
You're not cleared.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.246
Who invited you here
anyway?

10:47.247 --> 10:48.849
We did.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.483
Sir,
he's not cleared.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.719
He's
a D.C. homicide cop.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.921
Well, if I'm not mistaken,
Mr. spikings,

10:54.922 --> 10:56.956
what I see over there
is a homicide.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.124
Spikings:
But jurisdiction...

10:58.125 --> 10:59.558
jurisdiction
can go to hell.

10:59.559 --> 11:00.960
With all due respect,

11:00.961 --> 11:02.862
I'm in charge
of white house security.

11:02.863 --> 11:06.733
With all due respect, I'm the
president's national security adviser.

11:06.734 --> 11:09.335
A woman murdered
in the white house

11:09.336 --> 11:11.270
40 yards from where
the president sleeps

11:11.271 --> 11:13.173
is a matter
of national security.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.408
Alvin Jordan.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.810
Yes. Harlan Regis,
homicide.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.612
Sir, do you happen
to know what she was doing

11:20.613 --> 11:22.248
working here so late
on a Friday night?

11:22.249 --> 11:25.251
Well, the government doesn't shut
down just because it's Friday.

11:25.252 --> 11:28.087
Ah, yes. I understand.

11:28.088 --> 11:31.725
Oh, and do you know how many
people were in the white house?

11:35.395 --> 11:36.495
31.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.230
31?

11:38.231 --> 11:39.231
Yeah.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.232
Yeah.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.834
Carry on, detective.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.070
Thank you, sir.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.973
We'd like you to avoid
using 2 words

11:46.974 --> 11:48.841
if you give any statements
to the media.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.743
The words
are woman and murder.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.645
You say all information
will be forthcoming

11:53.646 --> 11:56.715
on an appropriate
and timely basis.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.684
Mr. spikings...

11:58.685 --> 12:00.119
One more thing.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.553
I'm gonna need
everything you have

12:01.554 --> 12:02.755
on what she was
working on...

12:02.756 --> 12:04.223
you'll get
what's material.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.959
Well, this is D.C., and,
unfortunately, she's mine.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.194
She was murdered
in the white house,

12:08.195 --> 12:09.595
not in some alley
out in southeast.

12:09.596 --> 12:10.596
She was killed
in my city.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.133
She was killed
in my house.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.836
Don't you ever forget that.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.473
He's all yours.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.413
Hey, I'm just trying
to do my job.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.649
Oh,
I guess I'm supposed

12:30.650 --> 12:33.019
to get my briefings
from CNN, right?

12:33.020 --> 12:35.021
No, you get it from
your secret service liaison

12:35.022 --> 12:36.622
for the task force.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.457
Well, he didn't
assign me one.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.493
Yes, he did.
Nina chance.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.533
I see. They think
I'm boo boo the fool.

12:47.534 --> 12:48.935
Excuse me?

12:48.936 --> 12:51.170
So I guess he figures that
I'll be easier on you

12:51.171 --> 12:53.139
than I would some rookie
with acne, right?

12:53.140 --> 12:55.741
Detective,
I'm an on-line agent

12:55.742 --> 12:57.910
for the United States
secret service,

12:57.911 --> 12:59.245
which means,
among other things,

12:59.246 --> 13:01.647
that I'm fully qualified
to answer any questions

13:01.648 --> 13:03.282
relating to white house
security.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.483
Furthermore, I resent
the implication...

13:04.484 --> 13:07.153
furthermore, you resent
the implication?

13:07.154 --> 13:08.487
Man.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.424
People don't even speak
English in this town anymore.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.662
[Sighs]

13:16.663 --> 13:19.231
Detective,
it's this way.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.666
I know that.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.901
There's been
no statement yet

13:21.902 --> 13:24.103
about what's happening
in the white house.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.072
We've been told only
that the first family

13:26.073 --> 13:28.007
is at camp David
for the weekend.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.708
As you can see behind me,

13:29.709 --> 13:32.278
the immediate area
has been sealed off.

13:32.279 --> 13:35.048
Sheldon turcott,
CNN, at the white house.

13:37.918 --> 13:41.120
Why kill someone from
the office of protocol?

13:41.121 --> 13:43.789
Maybe she sat some ambassador
in the wrong seat.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.591
Oh, they kill you
for that now?

13:45.592 --> 13:46.692
Tough town.

13:46.693 --> 13:47.860
If I would have known,

13:47.861 --> 13:49.161
I would have put
a turnstile in here

13:49.162 --> 13:50.997
and charged admission
or something.

13:50.998 --> 13:51.998
Who else was here?

13:51.999 --> 13:53.065
Um, secret service.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.500
They started
around 11:15.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.136
And can you believe they
even took her garbage?

13:57.137 --> 13:58.570
Anyway,
if you guys want me,

13:58.571 --> 13:59.571
I'll be downstairs,
101.

13:59.572 --> 14:00.806
Thank you
very much.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.009
Anytime.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.757
Wait a minute.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.392
The body's found at 11:00,

14:20.393 --> 14:23.130
and the feds arrive here
15 minutes later.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.065
How do they do that?

14:26.066 --> 14:30.002
Yeah. They don't even have
cool sirens like we do.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.039
Look at her photo album.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.474
Look at this, Regis.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.743
Is this the only one?

14:37.744 --> 14:39.811
It's the only one
I see,

14:39.812 --> 14:41.280
but, you know,
I just got here.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.882
I can tell you that the
apartment is registered

14:43.883 --> 14:45.884
in the name of,
uh...

14:45.885 --> 14:47.553
Brookland
associates,

14:47.554 --> 14:50.523
but that is about all
I have right now.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.070
Psst.

15:10.177 --> 15:13.079
Wow. 1.2 on the beach.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.480
White house giving out

15:14.481 --> 15:17.683
some pretty sweet Christmas
bonuses this year.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.486
Yeah,
looks that way.

15:21.654 --> 15:25.557
I want a complete list of
everybody in-house last night

15:25.558 --> 15:26.959
between 9:00 and 11:00,

15:26.960 --> 15:29.396
and don't tell me
that is classified.

15:34.201 --> 15:37.270
Quick on the draw,
huh, agent chance?

15:41.808 --> 15:43.376
There's only 30 names here.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.345
All whereabouts
accounted for.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.516
Spikings told me
that there were 31.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.621
I mean,
I see his name here.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.457
So whose name
is missing?

16:01.094 --> 16:03.762
Well, apparently, agent
spikings was mistaken.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.665
The count is 30
in-house.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.706
Better check it out.

16:14.707 --> 16:15.708
I'm on it.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.850
So, agent chance,
where you from?

16:24.851 --> 16:27.586
Iowa.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.121
Iowa, huh?

16:29.122 --> 16:31.123
So why
the secret service?

16:31.124 --> 16:32.991
I mean, why not...

16:32.992 --> 16:34.360
Why not
kindergarten teacher?

16:34.361 --> 16:36.195
No, you don't look like
one of those at all.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.596
I was in the Olympics.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.465
The Olympics?

16:39.466 --> 16:41.967
That's how I got
in the secret service.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.369
Is that right?

16:43.370 --> 16:44.570
I was on
the sharpshooting team.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.273
I met president Reagan.
It was in 1988.

16:47.274 --> 16:50.042
One of his agents
was a woman.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.278
She sort of took me
under her wing.

16:52.279 --> 16:56.248
Mmm. Sharpshooting. Ha.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.649
I feel safe already.

16:57.650 --> 17:01.188
I brought home the gold.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.491
Wow.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.929
Chance: Where are we going?

17:10.930 --> 17:13.465
Regis: To my place.
I gotta change.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.304
You're being evicted?

17:18.305 --> 17:19.471
The whole damn building.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.739
The feds
are tearing it down

17:20.740 --> 17:23.909
to put up a parking
garage for the, uh...

17:23.910 --> 17:26.244
For the, uh...

17:26.246 --> 17:27.846
Interstate commerce
commission.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.248
Yeah.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.016
What do they need a parking
lot around here for?

17:31.017 --> 17:33.785
Hell if I know. I've been
trying to figure that out.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.356
Whole building thinks that I
can fix it because I'm a cop.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.958
Harlan, what's going on?

17:39.959 --> 17:41.093
Mrs. Wallace.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.628
Look, in less than a month,

17:42.629 --> 17:44.396
we're going to be living
out on garbage cans.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.132
I'm making progress,
Mrs. Wallace.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.699
Truly I am.
Progress?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.435
Is that what you call it?

17:49.436 --> 17:50.469
Progress.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.671
I should say you are
making some progress.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.241
You better take care of your business, boy.
You know that?

17:55.242 --> 17:56.775
That's what you
should be doing

17:56.776 --> 17:59.010
is taking care of your business.
Making progress.

17:59.011 --> 18:01.181
I know what he's
making progress at.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.521
All right, make
yourself comfortable.

18:17.964 --> 18:22.335
Washington city,
July 21, 1861.

18:23.403 --> 18:27.306
And this is manassas,
first battle of bull run.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.376
Come here. I want
to show you something.

18:31.077 --> 18:35.481
Right here, that's where stonewall
Jackson got his nickname.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.184
That's sutley Springs there.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.386
Civilians used to come
on that crest over there

18:40.387 --> 18:43.054
and take carriages and
picnics to watch the battle.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.558
Amazing, huh?

18:46.693 --> 18:48.026
How did you...

18:48.027 --> 18:51.197
I'm a homicide cop in the
homicide capital of the world.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.799
It's cheaper
than a shrink.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.635
You did this
all by yourself?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.637
Mm-hmm.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.871
Yep.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.307
The whole thing.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.609
My father was
a history buff,

19:03.610 --> 19:05.844
so I guess it kind
of rubbed off on me.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.279
And what did he do?

19:07.280 --> 19:10.782
He worked at the Smithsonian
for about 34 years

19:10.783 --> 19:13.785
as a guard.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.288
[Sighs]

19:17.290 --> 19:20.326
How am I gonna
move all of this?

19:20.327 --> 19:21.727
I mean, first, I gotta
take it all apart,

19:21.728 --> 19:23.395
and then I gotta put it
all back together again.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.597
Oh, no. Hell, no.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.998
I can't move.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.368
I'll be right back.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.278
[Reporters shouting]

19:55.528 --> 19:58.964
Detective Regis, stengel's
been looking all over for you.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.031
Who isn't?

20:00.032 --> 20:03.635
Regis,
remember that claim check?

20:03.636 --> 20:06.104
I sent greeley
to the drug store.

20:06.105 --> 20:07.105
Hey.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.507
Hi.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.910
All right, let's
see what we got.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.848
And there she is,

20:16.849 --> 20:18.850
live and in color.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.820
Where'd you get these?

20:25.124 --> 20:26.525
[Sighs]

20:26.526 --> 20:28.394
We're gonna be late for the autopsy.
We gotta go.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.530
Her visa card activity,
last 24 hours.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.999
Banning travel,
1,500 bucks.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.467
I got it by a nose hair.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.902
Her phone records,
her credit card,

20:36.903 --> 20:40.272
her bank account all impounded
and now classified.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.274
She had a shuttle flight
to New York,

20:42.275 --> 20:43.975
a reservation at the Pierre,

20:43.976 --> 20:45.411
a hertz rental car,

20:45.412 --> 20:47.613
connecting flight to the
Virgin Islands, St. Croix,

20:47.614 --> 20:48.548
one way.

20:48.549 --> 20:51.383
Lady was buying herself
a new life.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.486
She wasn't coming back,
uh-uh.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.260
All right.

21:07.534 --> 21:10.936
The evidence indicates
a crime of passion.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.572
There's clear evidence
of vaginal penetration.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.674
There's traces of lubricant
in the vaginal tract

21:15.675 --> 21:17.443
and under the fingernails.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.479
The blows were from the left
and powerful.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.382
A condom was used.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.183
No semen...

21:25.184 --> 21:27.319
No blood except hers...

21:27.320 --> 21:29.055
No DNA.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.257
Signs of force?

21:32.258 --> 21:33.459
No.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.728
So you're saying sex,
not rape?

21:40.600 --> 21:43.603
This doesn't
leave the room.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.614
It was here we saw the image

21:55.615 --> 21:57.616
of an untroubled
president Jack Neil

21:57.617 --> 21:59.284
before
the white house murder

21:59.285 --> 22:03.556
cast a dark cloud over this once
highly regarded administration.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.669
[Cheering]

22:33.686 --> 22:37.523
Corey Alan luchessi,
janitor.

22:37.524 --> 22:40.559
Nobody can account for him
during a 45-minute period

22:40.560 --> 22:41.560
prior to the point

22:41.561 --> 22:42.894
where
the secret service

22:42.895 --> 22:45.631
found him working in the
east room at 11:02.

22:45.632 --> 22:47.866
The time of
her death has been set

22:47.867 --> 22:49.334
between 10:30

22:49.335 --> 22:51.537
and 11:00.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.271
That guy eats
a jelly doughnut,

22:53.272 --> 22:54.706
and then he
stabs her 8 times.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.675
Lee Harvey oswald
was seen

22:56.676 --> 22:59.678
in the book depository
cafeteria drinking a coke

22:59.679 --> 23:01.847
a minute
after Kennedy was shot.

23:01.848 --> 23:04.150
He's reading
soap opera digest.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.754
2 months ago.

23:23.302 --> 23:26.438
No, that's not enough.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.574
If that's all you got,
you got nothing.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.341
Except this.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.844
It was found
in the bathroom.

23:32.845 --> 23:36.848
It's the missing button from a shirt
found in luchessi's apartment.

23:36.849 --> 23:40.553
Luchessi doesn't
clean the bathrooms.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.691
All right,
where is he?

23:45.692 --> 23:46.758
They're picking him up.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.860
What would it take
for me

23:48.861 --> 23:51.162
to see all the surveillance
tapes from that night?

23:51.163 --> 23:52.532
Not much.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.102
Just an act of congress.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.106
After you, detective.

24:02.975 --> 24:03.976
[Sighs]

24:11.383 --> 24:14.019
Hal, that button
was labeled

24:14.020 --> 24:16.522
as being found
in the dining room.

24:16.523 --> 24:19.658
How did it get
up in the lavatory?

24:19.659 --> 24:22.228
Uh, I just must
have labeled it wrong.

24:30.069 --> 24:31.838
Luchessi...

24:33.239 --> 24:34.239
Luchessi...

24:34.240 --> 24:35.842
Did you kill her?

24:40.212 --> 24:43.081
Did you ever have an
affair with Carla town?

24:43.082 --> 24:44.249
No.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.252
No. Never.

24:47.854 --> 24:51.257
But you did come on
to her though, right?

24:54.326 --> 24:56.996
You did come on
to her, yeah?

24:58.698 --> 25:02.100
Did you come on
to Carla town?

25:02.101 --> 25:03.102
Yeah.

25:04.270 --> 25:05.804
I came on to her.

25:05.805 --> 25:08.506
I mean, you ever
get a look at her?

25:08.507 --> 25:10.375
Oh, yeah.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.578
Hot.

25:12.579 --> 25:15.346
You ever take it
any further than that?

25:15.347 --> 25:16.882
No.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.150
I mean,
listen to me.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.518
Carla...

25:20.519 --> 25:22.688
Was strictly
hands-off.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.791
What do you mean,
hands-off?

25:25.992 --> 25:27.358
I don't know.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.860
But that...
that was the word.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.897
The secret service was
looking out for her.

25:31.898 --> 25:32.832
How?

25:32.833 --> 25:34.499
I don't know. Uh...

25:34.500 --> 25:38.403
L-like if she worked
late, see. Um...

25:38.404 --> 25:41.306
11:00, 12:00...

25:41.307 --> 25:44.042
Well, the secret
service guys,

25:44.043 --> 25:46.913
they would always
drive her home.

26:05.998 --> 26:09.167
Don't want that,
don't want that...

26:09.168 --> 26:10.169
That.

26:17.476 --> 26:19.211
[Thunder]

26:29.488 --> 26:30.822
This is an act of war.

26:30.823 --> 26:33.024
This is the pueblo
revisited,

26:33.025 --> 26:34.760
and he wants to
negotiate?

26:34.761 --> 26:36.161
Give me a break.

26:36.162 --> 26:40.632
Neil negotiating to
defend us at a table?

26:40.633 --> 26:42.834
Why, he can't even
defend his own house.

26:42.835 --> 26:45.637
Fred, Fred, look.
Let me remind you

26:45.638 --> 26:47.038
that China
and north Korea

26:47.039 --> 26:48.940

You all done then?

46:28.419 --> 46:30.355
Yeah. Yeah.

46:37.896 --> 46:40.330
Spikings
wants to see you.

46:40.331 --> 46:41.466
Now.

47:01.286 --> 47:03.521
Is there anything
I should know about?

47:04.990 --> 47:06.591
I don't know.
Is there?

47:08.493 --> 47:10.095
You were
in the Olympics.

47:11.629 --> 47:15.099
You know what it means
to be a team player?

47:15.100 --> 47:17.135
Sharpshooting
isn't a team sport.

47:20.771 --> 47:22.473
Well, this is.

47:29.314 --> 47:31.715
We put our lives
on the line...

47:31.716 --> 47:34.252
Every single day.

47:36.187 --> 47:38.655
We have to trust the
people we work with.

47:38.656 --> 47:40.657
Is there a problem?

47:40.658 --> 47:42.059
You tell me.

47:42.060 --> 47:44.061
This case is closed.

47:44.062 --> 47:45.795
So I've heard.

47:45.796 --> 47:47.598
Harlan Regis hasn't.

47:49.600 --> 47:50.867
You would tell us

47:50.868 --> 47:53.403
if he tried to contact
you, wouldn't you?

47:53.404 --> 47:55.539
Of course.

47:55.540 --> 47:56.874
Good.

48:02.213 --> 48:06.150
'Cause if anybody found out
he elicited your support

48:06.151 --> 48:09.553
for his paranoid
theories,

48:09.554 --> 48:12.290
I'd hate to think
how that would look.

48:13.724 --> 48:15.426
What people might think...

48:17.495 --> 48:19.430
As a team.

48:21.232 --> 48:22.766
Why is the door shut?

48:22.767 --> 48:24.369
Excuse me?

48:26.004 --> 48:28.606
Why are your
hands on me?

48:30.441 --> 48:32.109
'Cause if anyone
walked in here,

48:32.110 --> 48:34.111
I'd hate to think
how that might look,

48:34.112 --> 48:35.646
what people
might think.

48:38.283 --> 48:40.251
As a team.

48:42.087 --> 48:43.753
In this day and age,

48:43.754 --> 48:46.191
they might get
the wrong idea.

49:07.578 --> 49:09.279
Sir...

49:09.280 --> 49:11.481
Agent chance examined
Carla town's effects

49:11.482 --> 49:12.649
8 minutes ago.

49:12.650 --> 49:13.650
Get her.

49:13.651 --> 49:15.619
And Cooper...

49:15.620 --> 49:16.953
Do it quietly.

49:16.954 --> 49:18.289
Yes, sir.

49:32.303 --> 49:36.007
Nina chance... find her
and lock her down.

49:40.911 --> 49:42.046
You two cover
the stairwell.

49:42.047 --> 49:43.514
I'll take the front.

49:49.387 --> 49:50.655
[Footsteps]

50:04.469 --> 50:05.469
Hey, Nina.

50:05.470 --> 50:06.471
Hey.

50:19.784 --> 50:20.850
We got a visual.

50:20.851 --> 50:22.553
I got it. I got it.

51:07.732 --> 51:08.733
Hey...

51:24.749 --> 51:26.584
Cover the front.
Right.

51:51.609 --> 51:54.844
Your approval
rating's dropped 19%.

51:54.845 --> 51:57.647
Your point?

51:57.648 --> 51:58.583
The point is,

51:58.584 --> 52:00.584
that it's enough
to distract anybody.

52:00.585 --> 52:02.118
From making
a sober judgment?

52:02.119 --> 52:04.020
I can't defend
my own house,

52:04.021 --> 52:06.356
so how am I going
to defend America?

52:06.357 --> 52:09.125
We're a superpower.
We should act like one.

52:09.126 --> 52:10.494
And so is China.

52:10.495 --> 52:12.128
Which, the last time I looked,

52:12.129 --> 52:14.030
had a defense pact
with north Korea.

52:14.031 --> 52:15.799
We can handle
China... Now.

52:15.800 --> 52:18.134
10 years time, at the
rate they're arming,

52:18.135 --> 52:19.770
who the hell knows?

52:21.839 --> 52:24.040
Mr. president...

52:24.041 --> 52:25.710
Let's bring the boys back.

52:28.979 --> 52:31.182
We can go in
with special forces.

52:33.984 --> 52:36.553
[Sighs]

52:36.554 --> 52:37.555
Alvin?

52:41.626 --> 52:43.694
General Tully
has a point.

52:49.133 --> 52:50.567
53% of America...

52:50.568 --> 52:53.870
think we should strike
the north Koreans.

52:53.871 --> 52:56.841
The vice president's point
just amplifies mine.

53:10.154 --> 53:12.289
Mr. president...

53:12.290 --> 53:14.525
Jack...

53:16.527 --> 53:18.762
I'm not going
to war over this.

53:18.763 --> 53:22.065
Alvin...

53:22.066 --> 53:25.769
I want the 7th fleet to stand down.
Not turn around.

53:25.770 --> 53:27.237
Stand down.

53:27.238 --> 53:30.574
If that doesn't bring them back
to the table, we'll reconvene.

53:30.575 --> 53:32.108
All right, thank you,
Mr. president.

53:32.109 --> 53:33.277
Gentlemen?

53:33.278 --> 53:34.911
You may be prepared
to sit around here

53:34.912 --> 53:36.913
while they're torturing
our boys. I'm not.

53:36.914 --> 53:38.748
We're not being passive.

53:38.749 --> 53:40.784
We're being patient.

53:40.785 --> 53:42.452
And prudent.

53:42.453 --> 53:43.987
Mr. president...

53:43.988 --> 53:45.822
I feel duty-bound
to tell you

53:45.823 --> 53:48.693
that your lack of action here
borders on the criminal.

53:52.196 --> 53:54.231
Then you've done
your duty, general.

53:57.768 --> 54:01.438
Now I'll do mine.

54:01.439 --> 54:05.942
I expect your resignation
on my desk in the morning.

54:05.943 --> 54:08.579
You shall have it.

54:11.416 --> 54:13.016
That's all, gentlemen.

54:13.017 --> 54:15.953
Alvin?

54:44.214 --> 54:45.382
What's the matter?

54:45.383 --> 54:47.718
[Paper rustling]
Here.

54:52.723 --> 54:54.558
This is Carla's tape from
my answering machine.

54:54.559 --> 54:56.461
Well, how'd you get it?
That's right.

54:58.729 --> 54:59.929
I stole it.

54:59.930 --> 55:02.632
Look...

55:02.633 --> 55:03.900
Here's what you need.

55:03.901 --> 55:06.570
In her appointment book,

55:06.571 --> 55:08.204
she has
a meeting in there

55:08.205 --> 55:10.375
scheduled for tomorrow
in New York.

55:13.711 --> 55:16.413
Craig nisker
and associates?

55:16.414 --> 55:18.014
He's the king of tell-all.

55:18.015 --> 55:23.019
His agency sold 5 of the top 10
scandal memoirs of all time.

55:23.020 --> 55:24.455
That's his motive.

55:27.458 --> 55:28.692
I'll be damned.

55:28.693 --> 55:31.361
Jack, Kyle,
and Carla...

55:31.362 --> 55:32.962
The oval office
threesome.

55:32.963 --> 55:35.599
Figure she was going
to burn the whole family.

55:35.600 --> 55:38.201
She was going
to score big with this.

55:38.202 --> 55:40.770
I guess Kyle
found out about it.

55:40.771 --> 55:43.139
We can place him at
the scene of the crime,

55:43.140 --> 55:45.341
and we know that he had a history
of violence against women.

55:45.342 --> 55:46.810
[Tires screeching]

55:46.811 --> 55:47.912
That's it.

55:49.246 --> 55:50.880
Oh, he's mine.

55:50.881 --> 55:53.850
Well, you just don't
get it, do you?

55:53.851 --> 55:56.954
These people can
make us disappear.

56:00.625 --> 56:01.925
I've got to get
out of here.

56:01.926 --> 56:04.193
Where are you going?

56:04.194 --> 56:06.996
I checked into a motel.

56:06.997 --> 56:08.064
I'll call you.

56:08.065 --> 56:09.834
Be careful.

56:17.475 --> 56:20.276
The court
may direct what?

56:20.277 --> 56:22.345
Mr. Peterson?

56:22.346 --> 56:25.949
Uh, under 21.98
of the criminal code,

56:25.950 --> 56:29.886
the court may allocate a fine
for the children of the victim.

56:29.887 --> 56:31.555
Please,
Mr. Peterson, please.

56:31.556 --> 56:33.557
What is it,
the porch light's on,

56:33.558 --> 56:35.258
but nobody's home,
is that it?

56:35.259 --> 56:37.093
Peterson:
Or the victim's spouse.

56:37.094 --> 56:39.463
Incorrect, Mr. Peterson.

56:39.464 --> 56:42.899
The court may direct that the
amount of the fine when paid

56:42.900 --> 56:46.302
be paid for the use of the
female seduced or her child

56:46.303 --> 56:48.505
if she have any.

56:48.506 --> 56:50.306
Now, pursuant
to this statute,

56:50.307 --> 56:54.911
we have Desmond vs.
Presley, which states...

56:54.912 --> 56:57.647
Where testimony
in rape prosecution

56:57.648 --> 57:00.484
concerning clothing of
defendant was technically...

57:00.485 --> 57:01.618
what is it, Mr. Neil?

57:01.619 --> 57:04.353
[Laughter]
Heavy date?

57:04.354 --> 57:06.691
That's... that's
pretty funny.

57:35.185 --> 57:37.286
Hey.

57:37.287 --> 57:38.623
You look good.

57:45.429 --> 57:46.696
[Sighs]

57:46.697 --> 57:48.297
What's going on?

57:48.298 --> 57:49.867
I just need your car,
all right?

58:24.468 --> 58:25.468
Hey!

58:25.469 --> 58:27.070
Get the fuck off of me!

58:27.071 --> 58:28.171
Easy! Easy!

58:28.172 --> 58:30.239
Jesus Christ, man,
you are a son of a bitch.

58:30.240 --> 58:31.875
I'm going to have your goddamn
badge, you know that?

58:31.876 --> 58:34.343
Why didn't you just shoot
her if you had this, huh?

58:34.344 --> 58:36.012
You know who I am? You know
who you're dealing with?

58:36.013 --> 58:37.313
I don't give a shit
who you are.

58:37.314 --> 58:39.482
You're going down.
Turn around.

58:39.483 --> 58:40.483
Get off of me!

58:40.484 --> 58:41.618
Get over here.

58:41.619 --> 58:43.419
Just like a big fish.

58:43.420 --> 58:45.022
Fell right for the bait.

58:47.357 --> 58:48.825
Or a man who wants to know
who's trying to frame him.

58:48.826 --> 58:50.126
You were with her
that night.

58:50.127 --> 58:51.427
You had sex with her,
and then you offed her.

58:51.428 --> 58:52.762
Oh, Jesus.

58:52.763 --> 58:54.163
You think
it was an accident

58:54.164 --> 58:56.332
she was murdered an hour
after I slept with her?

58:56.333 --> 58:58.835
Someone knew I'd be there
with her that night.

58:58.836 --> 59:01.470
Yeah, maybe somebody with
a motive as good as yours.

59:01.471 --> 59:02.706
What motive?

59:02.707 --> 59:04.708
Did your father
have sex with Carla town?

59:04.709 --> 59:07.043
I don't know my
father's sexual resume.

59:07.044 --> 59:08.845
You knew that she was
leaving town, though.

59:08.846 --> 59:10.513
Yeah, I read
the newspapers.

59:10.514 --> 59:11.748
2 nights in New York,

59:11.749 --> 59:13.182
a connecting ticket
to the Virgin Islands,

59:13.183 --> 59:14.383
and a hertz rent-a-car.

59:14.384 --> 59:15.685
So?

59:15.686 --> 59:18.288
So, Carla town didn't
have a driver's license.

59:20.357 --> 59:22.258
You think
I killed Carla?

59:22.259 --> 59:23.760
Yeah.

59:23.761 --> 59:25.696
You think you
could prosecute me?

59:26.631 --> 59:29.066
Your arms don't reach
that high, detective.

59:30.534 --> 59:32.637
Still don't understand
why you showed up.

59:34.705 --> 59:35.939
I go to sleep
every night

59:35.940 --> 59:38.007
thinking about a woman
with 8 stab wounds.

59:38.008 --> 59:41.444
A woman that I slept
with an hour before.

59:41.445 --> 59:43.147
You try that
as a sleeping pill.

59:46.583 --> 59:48.819
Hey, you forgot
something.

01:00:08.673 --> 01:00:11.675
TV: In what is fast rivaling the
north Korean hostage-taking

01:00:11.676 --> 01:00:13.810
as an issue of concern
for the white house,

01:00:13.811 --> 01:00:16.512
the murder of Carla town
remains unsolved.

01:00:16.513 --> 01:00:19.282
As the attention of Washington
homicide detectives

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:20.549
turn to Kyle Neil,

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:23.552
and the president's approval
ratings continue to plummet,

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:24.954
we must ask...

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:27.456
Will Carla town be
Jack Neil's chappaquiddick?

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.993
At this hour, no one knows
where the trail will end.

01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:32.095
We do know
that for an administration

01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:33.629
already knee-deep
in troubled waters

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:37.834
of a potentially international
confrontation in north Korea,

01:00:37.835 --> 01:00:39.635
a serious domestic
concern of this nature

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:44.407
is especially dangerous to the
president's public image.

01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:47.543
If Jack Neil is unable to protect
the workers under his own roof...

01:00:47.544 --> 01:00:48.746

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:26.283
Yeah.

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:31.989
Come on, Regis.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.056
Sorry I'm late.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:08.624
[Sighs]

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:10.126
What's the matter?

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:11.527
What is it?

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:12.929
They were there.

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:14.163
Who was where?

01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:16.200
The president
and the first lady.

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:19.668
They weren't at camp David
when Carla was murdered.

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:21.037
They were in
the white house!

01:02:21.038 --> 01:02:22.405
How do you know this?

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:24.874
That morning, I almost
shot their golden retriever.

01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:27.611
They never go anywhere
without that dog.

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:32.281
Tonight, I saw footage of them coming
back from camp David with the dog.

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:35.051
Their alibi
is complete bullshit.

01:02:35.052 --> 01:02:36.786
So, that means they
took them to camp David

01:02:36.787 --> 01:02:38.287
after the body
was discovered.

01:02:38.288 --> 01:02:40.056
Nina: Yeah.

01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:45.128
Regis: Spikings. He could
have smuggled them out.

01:02:45.129 --> 01:02:46.429
How?

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:48.898
The tunnels underneath
the white house.

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:52.635
Now, hey, look, I built
this city, remember?

01:02:52.636 --> 01:02:55.171
I just can't
believe this.

01:02:55.172 --> 01:02:57.273
They covered it up,
and they got them out?

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.341
Why?

01:02:58.342 --> 01:03:00.076
Because then they'd
be considered suspects

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:02.012
just like
everybody else.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:05.481
Why should they be,
though?

01:03:05.482 --> 01:03:06.782
That's the question.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:09.518
Nina: Because he's the president
of the United States.

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:10.920
Regis:
What does that mean?

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:12.355
That he doesn't
have a motive?

01:03:12.356 --> 01:03:14.557
He has a mistress about
to drop a tell-all.

01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:15.925
That's
motive enough.

01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:18.027
The wounds are
from the left.

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:19.863
President Neil
is right-handed.

01:03:19.864 --> 01:03:22.565
Yeah, I noticed that.

01:03:22.566 --> 01:03:24.868
He writes
with his right hand,

01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:26.269
but he swings
a baseball bat

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:27.837
and a golf club
with his left.

01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:30.440
Jesus.

01:03:32.576 --> 01:03:33.977
Yeah, she's still there.

01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:35.478
Now, do you want me
to finish this?

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:38.014
Man: No. They're right
where we want them.

01:03:38.015 --> 01:03:39.816
We're right on schedule.

01:03:54.198 --> 01:03:56.599
Thanks, Regis.
I appreciate it.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.134
I can take care
of myself.

01:03:58.135 --> 01:04:00.803
I want you to lay low until I
get to Jordan or spikings.

01:04:00.804 --> 01:04:02.005
Ok. Yeah.
Ok?

01:04:02.006 --> 01:04:04.074
[Helicopter]

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:07.843
Secret service.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.979
Shit! Mmm!

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:11.181
Back door.

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:28.464
Hey!

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:30.400
Move! Move!

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.070
Get them!
Go!

01:04:41.778 --> 01:04:43.080
Go! Go!

01:05:22.953 --> 01:05:24.653
Go for the gas tank!

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.390
He's clear!

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:42.006
Come on!

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:07.963
Reporter: Harlan, what
about Nina chance, huh?

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:09.965
Detective, do you have
any more information...

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:11.967
detective, is the
white house involved?

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:14.437
You want the spotlight?
Become a rock star.

01:06:14.438 --> 01:06:17.174
I'd reassign you, but
it'd make even more news.

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:19.542
[Knocking]

01:06:19.543 --> 01:06:21.844
Come in!

01:06:21.845 --> 01:06:23.912
Call for you,
detective Regis.

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.248
I'm not taking
any calls.

01:06:25.249 --> 01:06:27.317
It's
the white house.

01:06:28.585 --> 01:06:30.420
How lovely for you.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:35.291
Jordan: That was some stunt you
pulled last night, detective.

01:06:35.292 --> 01:06:38.094
Last night had nothing
to do with me.

01:06:38.095 --> 01:06:39.295
I was off-duty.

01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:40.896
Why do I find that
difficult to believe?

01:06:40.897 --> 01:06:42.565
I don't care
what you believe.

01:06:42.566 --> 01:06:44.767
I want to know why the
president was in residence

01:06:44.768 --> 01:06:46.001
the night
of the murder,

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:47.236
and you
didn't tell me.

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:49.538
The president's
not to be involved.

01:06:49.539 --> 01:06:52.041
The president is about to
become an official suspect.

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:53.876
Whoa.

01:06:53.877 --> 01:06:54.943
Suspect?

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:56.379
Look, it's my duty
to question...

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.147
you're not questioning
the president.

01:06:58.148 --> 01:07:01.550
The presidency is an
institution, not a person.

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:04.520
That institution will
be protected at all costs.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:05.988
Why do you think we got them
out of there that night?

01:07:05.989 --> 01:07:07.623
I don't know. Maybe
cover up a crime.

01:07:07.624 --> 01:07:10.426
No. To get the smell of blood
away from the north Koreans.

01:07:10.427 --> 01:07:12.895
They'd eat us alive. We'd
never get our boys back.

01:07:12.896 --> 01:07:15.398
This is global, detective.

01:07:15.399 --> 01:07:16.565
It's a little bit
off your turf.

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:19.236
This is a homicide.
This is my turf.

01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:22.071
[Sighs]

01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:23.473
Let me tell you
something.

01:07:25.142 --> 01:07:27.843
I've known Jack Neil
for 3 decades.

01:07:27.844 --> 01:07:29.545
I'm godfather
to his son.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.214
Your suspicions
are ludicrous.

01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:33.182
Luchessi's a stooge.

01:07:33.183 --> 01:07:34.883
How?
Then prove it.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:37.486
Nobody can pinpoint the
actual time of death,

01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:39.622
and he can't prove his
whereabouts for an hour.

01:07:39.623 --> 01:07:43.793
There are 27 cameras covering the
hallways of the working white house.

01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:48.931
You're telling me none of them
captured her walking down a hallway

01:07:48.932 --> 01:07:51.066
within 3 minutes
of her death?

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:54.571
Or are you trying
to tell me?

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:58.807
The tapes
are classified.

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:00.509
Out of my reach.

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:02.612
You republican
or democrat?

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:07.916
I think Washington is drowning
in a sea of its own bullshit.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:11.987
Those 13 men aren't risking
their lives over bullshit, pal.

01:08:11.988 --> 01:08:13.789
Well, this is not
about those 13 men.

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:16.259
It's about a dead woman
in the white house.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:19.962
You know...

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.163
Harvard did a study.

01:08:21.165 --> 01:08:23.765
Said you could measure
a man's longevity

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:26.569
by the first thing he turns
to in the morning paper.

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:31.308
Well, I'm
an obituary man.

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:35.312
Start with the comics.
You'll live longer.

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:25.528
Whoever leaked this,

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:28.231
I'm going to bottle
their last breath.

01:09:28.232 --> 01:09:30.098
Sir, if she
was alive at 10:49,

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:31.500
she had to be
murdered while at...

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:33.837
this doesn't change a damn
thing about luchessi.

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:37.305
Nobody saw him until 11:02.

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:42.044
That still gave him
13 minutes to do the job.

01:09:42.045 --> 01:09:44.247
[Telephones ringing]

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:51.019
[Sighs]

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:54.156
Regis... What are you
going to do?

01:09:54.157 --> 01:09:56.260
Put the president
in a lineup?

01:09:59.263 --> 01:10:01.196
Ok. You're Carla town.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:03.532
You're about to sell this story
for a shitload of money.

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.000
You're going
to move to paradise.

01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:07.671
You buy a one-way ticket,
never to return, right?

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:12.908
Tape: This is sears
calling for Carla town,

01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:14.710
confirming Monday
between 8:00 and 12:00

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:17.680
to install the trash compactor
you bought yesterday.

01:10:17.681 --> 01:10:19.815
Why the hell would you
have a trash compactor

01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:21.950
installed 2 days
after you're gone?

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:24.086
Maybe she forgot?

01:10:24.087 --> 01:10:26.589
She just bought it
the day before.

01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:28.223
What?

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:29.625
Shit!

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:32.629
Monday, 4:30.
You're right.

01:10:46.943 --> 01:10:47.943
What have you got?

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:50.714
Wait a minute...

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:00.656
And the handwriting
on the 23rd?

01:11:00.657 --> 01:11:02.725
The slope of the writing
is different.

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:03.759
Here.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.795
Look at this.

01:11:06.796 --> 01:11:09.398
The loop on the top of this
"L" is smooth and continuous.

01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:11.066
In the day planner,

01:11:11.067 --> 01:11:13.436
here, there's an obvious
pause in the writing.

01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:15.871
Mm-hmm. Which indicates
a deliberate stroke.

01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:17.072
Here.

01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:22.210
It's on the "b" as well.

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:23.547
This is a forgery.

01:11:25.549 --> 01:11:27.983
There never
was an appointment.

01:11:27.984 --> 01:11:30.286
She wasn't
going anywhere.

01:12:22.806 --> 01:12:25.374
Spikings?

01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:30.746
Entered at 12:09,
left at 12:14.

01:12:30.747 --> 01:12:32.147
Yes?

01:12:32.148 --> 01:12:33.516
Yes, sir.

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:35.951
Surveillance tapes.

01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:37.019
Well, he had clearance.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:39.688
Thank you.

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:40.690
Bob?

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:44.960
[Door opens]

01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:45.962
Yes, sir?

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:50.599
I want to talk to detective Regis, D.C.
homicide.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.501
He's going to want to
question Nick spikings.

01:12:52.502 --> 01:12:54.837
Get me spikings'
address in Alexandria.

01:12:54.838 --> 01:12:55.839
Bob: Yes, sir.

01:13:12.956 --> 01:13:15.257
Somebody's been playing
us like puppets.

01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:16.792
What are you saying?

01:13:16.793 --> 01:13:20.729
Carla town wasn't killed to
protect the administration.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.631
She was murdered
to destroy it.

01:13:22.632 --> 01:13:24.332
What do you mean?

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:26.935
I'm saying that somebody dumped
the dead body in the white house

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:29.572
so that the blood trail could
lead right to the first family.

01:13:29.573 --> 01:13:31.908
They even manufactured
the motive.

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:45.489
[Knock on door]

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:49.493
[Sighs]

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:54.963
So?

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:58.734
Spikings: Only the guard
knew I took the tapes.

01:13:58.735 --> 01:14:01.236
That means you've got
someone on the inside.

01:14:01.237 --> 01:14:04.573
Regis: It's time you and I
stopped playing games.

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:06.710
Sit down.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:32.801
You have any idea what it takes
to stand all day in one place

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:35.471
watching a dumpster
in the pouring rain?

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:39.575
Because that dumpster just
happens to be next to a hotel

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:42.679
where the president is going to
be staying the following day?

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.750
And his life
is in your hands.

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:52.756
Loneliest job
in the world.

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:01.931
Get rid of the wire.

01:15:01.932 --> 01:15:03.800
I know who's
listening anyway.

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:13.577
[Click]

01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:21.117
Regis.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:28.323
Think you got it all
figured out, huh?

01:15:28.324 --> 01:15:29.525
[Chuckles]

01:15:32.061 --> 01:15:34.530
You haven't read me
right at all.

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:49.912
I see my life
and my service

01:15:49.913 --> 01:15:54.083
with a clarity
you're incapable...

01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:17.140
shit.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.361
[Click]

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:14.363
Shit!

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:28.377
Aah!

01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:46.128
Shit!

01:17:46.129 --> 01:17:47.130
Cover me!

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.079
Go!

01:18:05.081 --> 01:18:06.414
Thought you were
a sharpshooter.

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:07.416
Save it.

01:18:11.087 --> 01:18:14.156
Freeze China out if they
stand with north Korea.

01:18:14.157 --> 01:18:16.558
All talks for
a grain deal cease

01:18:16.559 --> 01:18:18.260
until they stand down.

01:18:18.261 --> 01:18:21.330
If China wants grain,
I want our boys back.

01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:24.967
You got 5 minutes, al.

01:18:24.968 --> 01:18:28.171
I'm afraid it's going
to take longer than that.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:32.809
It's bad news,
Mr. president.

01:18:34.978 --> 01:18:36.711
It's still Jack, Alvin.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:38.748
Nick spikings is dead.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.050
What?

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:46.956
And he had evidence that
Kyle killed Carla town.

01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:49.926
Spikings collected it.

01:18:51.027 --> 01:18:54.162
They found a condom
with Kyle's semen

01:18:54.163 --> 01:18:55.898
and the woman's
fingerprints on it.

01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:59.102
They found
the murder weapon.

01:19:01.537 --> 01:19:04.907
And a surveillance tape putting
Kyle and the woman together

01:19:04.908 --> 01:19:08.643
just minutes
before the murder.

01:19:08.644 --> 01:19:11.479
There's got to be
another explanation.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.248
No, no.

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:18.220
And spikings was just about to
cut himself a deal to leak it.

01:19:18.221 --> 01:19:19.923
Nick spikings?

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:22.624
He wouldn't
do that to me.

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:24.293
Everybody
has a price.

01:19:27.663 --> 01:19:28.831
Not the first thing
in your life

01:19:28.832 --> 01:19:31.067
you've been naive
about, is it, Jack?

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:34.103
Obviously not.

01:19:36.005 --> 01:19:37.974
Well, you're safe now.

01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:41.177
So's Kyle.

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:56.258
Spikings...

01:19:56.259 --> 01:19:57.526
Was murdered.

01:20:15.778 --> 01:20:18.713
Man on TV: Just get a bucket
and start getting the water

01:20:18.714 --> 01:20:20.582
out of the boat,
you guys.

01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:23.519
Second man: Mayday, this is the
ketch Rene off Turner point...

01:20:25.088 --> 01:20:27.090
let's see what we got.

01:20:30.593 --> 01:20:32.295
Jordan.

01:20:35.865 --> 01:20:38.700
21:18. That's 9:18.

01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:40.970
All right,
he goes out there.

01:20:43.239 --> 01:20:45.373
Hey, we got a special on
that model this week, folks.

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:46.474
4 heads, 21...

01:20:46.475 --> 01:20:47.775
back off.

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:49.644
Sure. Only a couple left,
though.

01:20:49.645 --> 01:20:51.114
Just so you know.

01:20:52.916 --> 01:20:55.417
Regis: 20:16.

01:20:55.418 --> 01:20:58.087
8:16, he comes in.

01:21:02.725 --> 01:21:06.261
I can even throw in a universal
remote with that, you know?

01:21:06.262 --> 01:21:07.163
Back off!

01:21:07.164 --> 01:21:08.796
Sure, sure, take your time.

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:11.000
Just, uh, ask for Jack.

01:21:12.835 --> 01:21:15.537
He comes in, and yet
he leaves... wait.

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:16.539
Who's that?

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.077
I know that guy.

01:21:25.781 --> 01:21:29.584
That's the guy
that was at spikings'.

01:21:29.585 --> 01:21:31.219
The 31st name.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.289
Jordan walked him in.

01:21:34.690 --> 01:21:37.160
Jordan set up
the whole thing.

01:21:38.194 --> 01:21:39.527
Yeah.

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:42.230
Newscaster: The investigation
into the white house murder

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:43.999
has resulted in 2 suspects.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.668
The car, a burgundy
Chevrolet caprice,

01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:49.804
has been identified as
the possible suspect car.

01:21:49.805 --> 01:21:51.373
In other news,

01:21:51.374 --> 01:21:55.211
a strike is pending as
workers' contract talks...

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:59.414
There won't be anything
anyone can prove.

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:02.218
All the evidence
will be destroyed.

01:22:06.789 --> 01:22:08.424
What do you want?

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:14.563
Your resignation.

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:18.067
Effective 10 P.M.

01:22:19.502 --> 01:22:23.338
I don't know why you
look surprised, Jack.

01:22:23.339 --> 01:22:25.907
Tully wasn't half-right
when he called it criminal.

01:22:25.908 --> 01:22:28.376
Because we didn't go in
with guns blazing?

01:22:28.377 --> 01:22:29.777
You think that would've
saved our boys?

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.981
You have failed,
Mr. president!

01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:36.418
You have failed your
office pitifully.

01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:38.286
I've seen your
cowardice grow

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:39.887
from the very
beginning.

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.256
And then, finally,

01:22:41.257 --> 01:22:42.991
not having served your
country in the military,

01:22:42.992 --> 01:22:47.129
you had no idea of
the time-honored code

01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:50.699
of never leaving a man
on the field of battle.

01:22:54.003 --> 01:22:57.039
You should've brought
those awacs boys home

01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:00.042
dead, wounded,
or otherwise.

01:23:00.043 --> 01:23:03.646
You should've done it
by force if necessary.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.315
Any president who
serves up his country

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:09.317
as appetizers
for the enemy

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:12.088
isn't fit for this office.

01:23:16.925 --> 01:23:18.926
So the choice is yours.

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:20.928
You can... you can resign.

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:22.730
Say it's due to your health.

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:25.333
And you can tour the best
golf clubs in America.

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:27.935
Or you can stay
in office,

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:31.140
and you can watch
your son destroyed.

01:23:32.541 --> 01:23:34.342
The choice is yours.

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:38.547
I mean, if any father
can call that a choice.

01:23:45.288 --> 01:23:47.355
Why didn't he just
kill Neil?

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:49.157
Because it's easier
to kill the secretary

01:23:49.158 --> 01:23:50.592
than it is
the president.

01:23:50.593 --> 01:23:53.928
Besides, alive
and ruined is better.

01:23:53.929 --> 01:23:55.097
Than what?

01:23:55.098 --> 01:23:56.564
Than dead and martyred.

01:23:56.565 --> 01:23:58.633
Radio newscaster: And now
this special bulletin.

01:23:58.634 --> 01:24:02.237
An oval office address is
scheduled for 10:00 tonight.

01:24:02.238 --> 01:24:05.039
Unidentified sources say
the president will resign.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.308
Jordan played his card.

01:24:06.309 --> 01:24:08.276
Newscaster: In related news,
all federal...

01:24:08.277 --> 01:24:10.778
all right,
that gives us 2 hours

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:14.582
to get to the white house
and the president.

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:16.451
Are you insane?

01:24:16.452 --> 01:24:18.220
How?

01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:21.256
We'll use the tunnels
the same way they got out.

01:24:21.257 --> 01:24:23.725
You don't even know
where they are.

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:25.193
Yeah, but you do.

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:26.994
I mean, you know
the security,

01:24:26.995 --> 01:24:28.597
and you know the layout.

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:31.566
You're out of your mind.

01:24:31.567 --> 01:24:34.569
Why, because I'm about
to help a government

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:37.239
that's kicking me out
on the streets?

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:39.608
You got no argument there.

01:24:47.683 --> 01:24:49.852
Regis: We got to get rid
of this car.

01:24:56.058 --> 01:24:58.661
[Telephone rings]

01:24:59.895 --> 01:25:01.096
Hello.

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:04.632
Don't say my name.

01:25:04.633 --> 01:25:05.767
Just listen.

01:25:05.768 --> 01:25:08.303
Remember where we had
that homicide 2 weeks ago?

01:25:08.304 --> 01:25:09.337
Stengel: Yeah.

01:25:09.338 --> 01:25:12.375
Ok. Meet me there
in one hour.

01:25:29.325 --> 01:25:30.925
[Whispering]
Get down.

01:25:30.926 --> 01:25:31.926
Cops.

01:25:31.927 --> 01:25:33.396
2.

01:25:34.730 --> 01:25:36.865
That's the steam grate.

01:25:38.534 --> 01:25:40.535
It'll take us to one of 3
points that are vulnerable

01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:42.103
to penetration in
the white house.

01:25:42.104 --> 01:25:45.640
Eisenhower put a water filtering
system down in there.

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:47.675
There's got to be
an alarm.

01:25:47.676 --> 01:25:48.611
Yeah, there is.

01:25:48.612 --> 01:25:51.078
It goes off
all the way across town.

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:52.314
The general services
building.

01:25:52.315 --> 01:25:54.249
No white house,
no secret service.

01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:56.150
Regis:
Response time?

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.220
Well, officially
5-7 minutes.

01:25:58.221 --> 01:26:01.088
But realistically 10 or 11.

01:26:01.089 --> 01:26:03.458
By that time
we'll either be fired,

01:26:03.459 --> 01:26:05.460
or we're going to be dead.

01:26:05.461 --> 01:26:07.462
I was a park ranger
during that.

01:26:07.463 --> 01:26:08.264
You?

01:26:08.265 --> 01:26:09.864
What do you think?

01:26:09.865 --> 01:26:11.567
Meet and greet time?

01:26:16.605 --> 01:26:17.873
Ahem.

01:26:22.978 --> 01:26:24.779
He said you did it, too.

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:25.980
Hold on.

01:26:25.981 --> 01:26:26.981
Evening, officers.

01:26:26.982 --> 01:26:28.049
Evening.

01:26:28.050 --> 01:26:29.817
Tense night in
the big city, huh?

01:26:29.818 --> 01:26:30.985
Yeah.

01:26:30.986 --> 01:26:34.256
Could be this thing with
the president maybe, huh?

01:26:34.257 --> 01:26:35.390
Nice to know, though,

01:26:35.391 --> 01:26:37.992
that we have our
men in blue out here

01:26:37.993 --> 01:26:39.994
to keep a watchful eye
over us.

01:26:39.995 --> 01:26:41.864
Are you from Washington?

01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:44.700
Ok.

01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:49.671
Hey, didn't that old senator
lay the wood

01:26:49.672 --> 01:26:51.773
to that stripper around
here somewhere years ago?

01:26:51.774 --> 01:26:54.609
All right. Take it easy
this evening, huh?

01:26:54.610 --> 01:26:55.544
Just asking.

01:26:55.545 --> 01:26:57.412
Didn't see it on my...
my guide map.

01:26:57.413 --> 01:26:59.281
Ok, we'll see you
later, all right?

01:26:59.282 --> 01:27:00.282
All right, gentlemen.

01:27:00.283 --> 01:27:01.283
Good night.

01:27:25.274 --> 01:27:26.909
Come on, come on,
come on.

01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:30.513
My grandmother moves
faster than you.

01:27:48.331 --> 01:27:49.331
Nina: Wait.

01:27:49.332 --> 01:27:50.932
Stengel: Where are we?

01:27:50.933 --> 01:27:52.300
We're under the mall.

01:27:52.301 --> 01:27:53.735
That's Pennsylvania Avenue.

01:27:53.736 --> 01:27:55.269
Which way?

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:56.939
It's not far.

01:28:04.847 --> 01:28:05.947
Oh, Christ.

01:28:05.948 --> 01:28:07.148
Now what?

01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:09.351

This is the old
emergency water system.

These pipes go
right through the wall.

Good, 'cause that's
where we're going.

01:28:21.063 --> 01:28:22.397
After you're sworn in,

01:28:22.398 --> 01:28:24.366
you'll make a short statement
saluting Jack Neil

01:28:24.367 --> 01:28:26.200
for his service
to his country.

01:28:26.201 --> 01:28:28.503
You'll ask for
the country's prayers

01:28:28.504 --> 01:28:30.237
for bi-partisan unity.

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:32.907
Would you 2 excuse us
now, please?

01:28:32.908 --> 01:28:34.577

These are
the escape tunnels.

01:29:21.457 --> 01:29:22.890
Lincoln had these built

01:29:22.891 --> 01:29:24.426
in case the confederates
laid siege to the white house.

isn't practical?

01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:59.722
Hang in there,
all right?

01:31:14.002 --> 01:31:16.004
[Rats squeak]

01:31:29.284 --> 01:31:30.653
Aah!

01:31:40.262 --> 01:31:41.428
Uhh!

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:42.631
Uhh!

01:31:55.077 --> 01:31:56.211
Uhh!

01:32:02.551 --> 01:32:05.219
We got to cross over.

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:07.388
Newswoman: Tonight,
in less than an hour,

01:32:07.389 --> 01:32:08.990
Jack Neil will step down

01:32:08.991 --> 01:32:11.425
after a little more
than 2 years in office.

01:32:11.426 --> 01:32:14.863
For CNN, I'm Doris MacMillan
reporting.

01:32:51.767 --> 01:32:53.568
Let's do this.

01:33:05.247 --> 01:33:06.981
Ok, wait.

01:33:06.982 --> 01:33:07.916
We're here.

01:33:07.917 --> 01:33:09.116
These are motion sensors.

01:33:09.117 --> 01:33:11.452
They trip the alarm
in the white house.

01:33:11.453 --> 01:33:14.288
We set those off and this
room fills up with agents.

01:33:14.289 --> 01:33:15.623
How long?

01:33:15.624 --> 01:33:16.992
10 seconds.

01:33:24.933 --> 01:33:28.202
We've come too far
to turn back now.

01:33:28.203 --> 01:33:29.738
Yeah.

01:33:31.173 --> 01:33:34.810
I'll hold them off
as long as I can.

01:33:55.197 --> 01:33:57.331
[Alarm]

01:33:57.332 --> 01:34:00.068
[Beeping]

01:34:03.171 --> 01:34:04.571
Movement in 102.

01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:05.907
Repeat, movement in 102.

01:34:05.908 --> 01:34:07.608
Subsector-11 tunnels.

01:34:07.609 --> 01:34:09.411
Repeat, tunnels,
subsector-11.

01:34:11.279 --> 01:34:13.916
Move! Get out of the way!

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:18.754
[Alarm]

01:34:25.127 --> 01:34:26.929
[Beep beep beep]

01:34:37.339 --> 01:34:38.740
You're under arrest!

01:34:38.741 --> 01:34:40.075
Drop your weapon!

01:34:51.854 --> 01:34:54.021
Agent: Check the corridor
all the way down.

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:57.359
Second agent:
Checking subsector grade.

01:35:11.774 --> 01:35:13.341
Agent: Yo, go!

01:35:15.911 --> 01:35:17.111
Agent: Cover sector-12.

01:35:17.112 --> 01:35:18.113
Got it.

01:35:26.388 --> 01:35:28.055
Freeze! Hold it!

01:35:28.056 --> 01:35:30.691
Ok, on the ground.
On the ground!

01:35:30.692 --> 01:35:32.394
Get on the ground.

01:36:27.983 --> 01:36:29.917
Agent: Clear sector 7
right now.

01:36:29.918 --> 01:36:31.919
Report back to me only.

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:34.122
[Whistling]

01:36:45.868 --> 01:36:47.469
Let's go.

01:36:53.208 --> 01:36:55.143
[Whistling]

01:37:49.064 --> 01:37:50.899
What agent captured?

01:37:54.002 --> 01:37:55.603
Get her up here.

01:38:00.742 --> 01:38:03.311
[Whistling]

01:38:16.691 --> 01:38:18.292
Not now.

01:38:18.293 --> 01:38:19.494
Hold it.

01:38:21.930 --> 01:38:24.166
Let me see some I.D.

01:38:26.568 --> 01:38:28.035
Agent, gun!

01:38:28.036 --> 01:38:29.870
The janitor!
Jordan.

01:38:29.871 --> 01:38:31.906
Agent: Get down!
Get down!

01:38:36.278 --> 01:38:39.080
Get him!
He killed spikings!

01:38:39.081 --> 01:38:40.581
Mr. president!

01:38:40.582 --> 01:38:41.748
Your son is innocent!

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:43.850
Sir, you can't
be here.

01:38:43.851 --> 01:38:44.851
I am here.

01:38:44.852 --> 01:38:46.120
Seal the corridor.

01:38:46.121 --> 01:38:48.589
I am still the president!

01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:50.625
Seal the corridor!

01:38:53.361 --> 01:38:54.996
Alvin Jordan,
you're under arrest

01:38:54.997 --> 01:38:57.531
for conspiracy in
the murder of Carla town

01:38:57.532 --> 01:38:59.066
and Nicholas spikings.

01:38:59.067 --> 01:39:00.467
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:39:00.468 --> 01:39:02.203
Anything you say can
and will be held against you

01:39:02.204 --> 01:39:03.837
in a court of law.

01:39:03.838 --> 01:39:05.206
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:39:05.207 --> 01:39:07.008
If you can't afford one,
you prick,

01:39:07.009 --> 01:39:10.212
one will be appointed
by the courts.

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:18.419
How did you get in here?

01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:19.753
I crawled.

01:39:19.754 --> 01:39:22.856
He's the one who gave spikings
the evidence on your son.

01:39:22.857 --> 01:39:24.691
Regis: The evidence
is you on tape

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:26.960
with the man you walked
in to kill Carla town.

01:39:26.961 --> 01:39:30.497
The same man who put a bullet
through Nicholas spikings.

01:39:30.498 --> 01:39:31.898
Stand him up.

01:39:31.899 --> 01:39:33.900
You don't have
to believe me.

01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:35.469
Just look at the tape.

01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:36.637
It's in my back.

01:39:36.638 --> 01:39:37.605
Agent?

01:39:37.606 --> 01:39:39.506
Mr. president, Carla
town was killed

01:39:39.507 --> 01:39:40.442
to destroy you.

01:39:40.443 --> 01:39:42.309
To force your
resignation.

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:44.311
Then Jordan had
spikings shot

01:39:44.312 --> 01:39:46.214
because
he saw the tape.

01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:02.329
Arrest him.

01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:04.398
What?

01:40:04.399 --> 01:40:05.766
Not him.

01:40:05.767 --> 01:40:07.269
Him.

01:40:17.879 --> 01:40:19.280
My god, Alvin.

01:40:19.281 --> 01:40:22.283
You really had her killed,
didn't you?

01:40:22.284 --> 01:40:25.319
I think president Teddy
Roosevelt said it best.

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:29.823
If I must choose between
righteousness and peace,

01:40:29.824 --> 01:40:33.128
I choose righteousness.

01:40:35.097 --> 01:40:37.564
She was 25 years old.

01:40:37.565 --> 01:40:39.032
She was a child.

01:40:39.033 --> 01:40:41.569
She was a casualty of war.

01:40:45.107 --> 01:40:46.574
Mr. president.

01:40:51.346 --> 01:40:53.481
Get him out of here.

01:40:56.851 --> 01:40:59.053
Thank you, son.

01:41:01.789 --> 01:41:03.325
Gun!

01:41:13.401 --> 01:41:15.602
Nina, just stay easy.

01:41:15.603 --> 01:41:17.003
Stay easy.

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:19.873
Just stay easy.
I'm right here.

01:41:19.874 --> 01:41:21.843
All right, hold on.

01:41:25.547 --> 01:41:28.749
No, there's absolutely
no truth whatsoever

01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:30.151
to any of those rumors.

01:41:30.152 --> 01:41:33.154
At no time was
president Neil planning

01:41:33.155 --> 01:41:35.189
on resigning from office.

01:41:35.190 --> 01:41:37.057
Here's what we know so far.

01:41:37.058 --> 01:41:40.327
The murderer of Carla town
is dead.

01:41:40.328 --> 01:41:41.762
He was killed today

01:41:41.763 --> 01:41:44.865
as he fired upon authorities
attempting to arrest him.

01:41:44.866 --> 01:41:48.402
In that same gun battle,

01:41:48.403 --> 01:41:51.672
national security advisor
Alvin Jordan

01:41:51.673 --> 01:41:55.909
and senior secret service
agent Nicholas spikings

01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:57.512
were also killed.

01:42:00.315 --> 01:42:03.317
Did the killer actually
penetrate the white house

01:42:03.318 --> 01:42:05.719
with the objective
of killing miss town?

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.987
In 180 years,

01:42:06.988 --> 01:42:09.055
there has never been a
penetration of the white house.

01:42:09.056 --> 01:42:12.293
President and Mrs. Neil will
have a statement for you later.

01:42:12.294 --> 01:42:13.394
Thank you very much.

01:42:13.395 --> 01:42:15.929
[Shouting questions]

01:42:15.930 --> 01:42:17.398
Call D.C. homicide.

01:42:17.399 --> 01:42:19.300
Tell them the detective
we found in the tunnel

01:42:19.301 --> 01:42:21.302
is on his way to
university hospital.

01:42:21.303 --> 01:42:23.837
Paramedics say
he's going to be fine.

01:42:23.838 --> 01:42:25.907
Neil: How is she?

01:42:27.242 --> 01:42:28.876
She's stable.

01:42:30.178 --> 01:42:31.846
You saved my life.

01:42:33.548 --> 01:42:36.351
Thank you.

01:42:38.786 --> 01:42:41.188
And detective,

01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:42.789
how can I ever repay you?

01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:44.391
Mmm, don't bother.

01:42:44.392 --> 01:42:46.327
Just doing my job.

01:42:46.328 --> 01:42:48.895
Well,
there is one thing.

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:50.531
Yes, detective?

01:42:50.532 --> 01:42:53.200
Have you ever heard of the
interstate commerce commission?

01:42:53.201 --> 01:42:54.601
Sure.

01:42:54.602 --> 01:42:56.136
Secretary Randall's office
is right down the street.

01:42:56.137 --> 01:42:57.538
Right down the street?

01:42:57.539 --> 01:42:58.340
Yeah.

01:42:58.341 --> 01:43:00.341
See? It's not
what you know,

01:43:00.342 --> 01:43:01.942
it's who you know.

01:43:01.943 --> 01:43:03.744
What are you doing
for dinner?

01:43:03.745 --> 01:43:06.948
