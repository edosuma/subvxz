WEBVTT

00:12.762 --> 00:13.888
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.473
I'm sorry!

00:16.850 --> 00:19.102
- You're from
the Disciples of Dawn, right?

00:19.144 --> 00:21.021
We don't hear much
about you guys.

00:21.062 --> 00:22.105
- It's to protect you.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.482
- Lumi, gonna find ya!

00:24.524 --> 00:25.984
Lumi!

00:26.026 --> 00:28.778
- This was on a tree, like,
20 feet from my house.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.072
And I heard this, like, freaky,
like, whistling sound.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.449
- I'll split off.
You two go ahead.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.909
Pray, warm shadow, let me in.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.751
- Carrie?

00:42.792 --> 00:44.085
Who are you?

01:03.855 --> 01:05.857
- Warmth, friend.

01:07.817 --> 01:09.611
Sleep easy.

01:23.667 --> 01:27.045
To vast Gehenna,
I give my skin,

01:27.087 --> 01:31.132
pray, warm shadow,
let me...in.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.735
- Steady.

02:10.422 --> 02:14.676
- Much blood has been spilled,
and we mourn our dead.

02:16.511 --> 02:19.139
We have all failed.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.975
But Arthur Dean,

02:22.017 --> 02:24.561
in exchange for keeping watch
over the guardian's post,

02:24.602 --> 02:26.479
you've long been
given privileges

02:26.521 --> 02:28.481
not offered to the rest of us.

02:30.525 --> 02:36.740
So it is with your negligence
that Carrie Ecker escaped

02:36.781 --> 02:40.660
and five of our family
were slaughtered.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.707
Find and return her at once,

02:45.749 --> 02:49.210
or face the consequences
in her place.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.133
- Warmth, Council.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.926
all: Warmth to you.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.347
- On my life.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.688
- Arthur!

03:08.730 --> 03:12.525
Next month, I start
my guardianship training.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.402
- Let's see your meanest look.

03:49.312 --> 03:52.273
I am a vessel
filled with light.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.403
I am a weapon
against the shadow.

03:56.444 --> 03:59.364
My pain is a symptom
of sacrifice.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.908
My sacrifice
is a symptom of love.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.411
I am a vessel filled
with light.

04:04.452 --> 04:07.288
I am a weapon
against the shadow.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.708
My pain is a symptom
of sacrifice.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.337
My sacrifice...

04:14.379 --> 04:16.631
is a symptom of love.

05:11.436 --> 05:14.689
- Hey, are you all right?

05:17.901 --> 05:21.363
- Hi, sir, how can I help you?
- Just looking.

05:26.659 --> 05:27.911
Go. Go. Go.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.415
Something for your kids.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.669
- Oh, poor girl.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.004
You don't know
what you got yourself into.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.723
- Time to chow down
if I'm gonna get you to Salem.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.933
- Dad, can Carrie
stay a few more days?

06:32.892 --> 06:35.103
I'm not done with her yet.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.108
- Fine.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.069
I'm introducing her to Khalil's
famous flapjacks, then.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.782
- Mmm.

06:49.951 --> 06:54.622
- This is how a man
makes pancakes.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.250
Fluffy. Buttery.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.960
Like a cloud.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.590
You know what this is?

07:03.631 --> 07:05.800
- Off-brand maple syrup.
- Hey.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.471
Liquid gold.
- Off-brand maple syrup.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.098
- Liquid gold.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.642
- Carrie's my daughter now.
I don't want you.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.103
- Mm.
- And do the dishes.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.617
- When's Nolan coming?

07:30.658 --> 07:33.828
- Um, soon as Dad leaves.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.789
You still promise to open up?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.001
- You're a good friend
for helping him.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.671
- Maybe.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.298
You ever feel
like you can tell strangers

07:45.340 --> 07:47.759
more than you can tell
your closest friends?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.761
- I've only met
three strangers.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.347
- True.

07:52.389 --> 07:55.058
That's wild.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.560
Last week,
Nolan and I got stoned,

07:57.602 --> 07:59.521
and, like an idiot,

07:59.562 --> 08:02.524
I pulled his arm around me.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.025
I put my head on his chest

08:04.067 --> 08:06.403
and I told him how strong
he felt holding me;

08:06.444 --> 08:11.074
and I just, like--I wanted him
to kiss me...so bad.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.369
- Did he?

08:14.411 --> 08:16.329
- He bounced.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.206
Now whenever I try
to touch him, he goes cold,

08:18.248 --> 08:20.041
and, like--

08:20.083 --> 08:22.711
I used to think
he was gay 'cause, like, right?

08:23.586 --> 08:26.047
But my dude watches literal
truckloads of lesbian porn,

08:26.089 --> 08:28.383
so...I just suck.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.761
Sorry.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.806
- Maybe just talk to him,
Tasha.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.394
- Charlie doesn't carry
an insulin pump.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.770
- It's not him, Melanie.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.189
- She could go into shock.
You know this.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.733
- Of course
I'm thinking about that.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.193
- Okay then. Find my daughter.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.029
- We've surveyed the neighbors.
We have search teams

08:49.070 --> 08:50.739
looking under every rock
in a five-mile radius--

08:50.780 --> 08:52.073
- Are they searching up
your ass?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.450
They've searched
everywhere else.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.868
Talk to Melanie's ex.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.494
- Mrs. Frisk, please.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.706
- Charlie's pissed about what
my sister's doing at the mines.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.541
- He's unstable.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.209
- Rhonda Nguyen herself
saw Charlie

09:03.251 --> 09:05.545
sloshed at the Ashland right
at the time Lumi went missing.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.547
- All of his friends
are miners!

09:07.589 --> 09:09.883
And don't start with Rhonda.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.259
Her one defining trait

09:11.301 --> 09:13.219
is thinking
she was abducted by aliens.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.637
She's an idiot.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.348
Find my daughter.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.515
- Buddy, you want to tell me

09:17.557 --> 09:19.726
about that whistling
sound again?

09:19.768 --> 09:22.604
- It--it was out in the woods.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.981
It sounded like
an underwater flute.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.400
I don't know.
It--it was pretty.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.694
- His head's so lost in space

09:29.736 --> 09:31.571
that Rhonda Nguyen
should do an exposÃ©

09:31.613 --> 09:33.365
about it on her idiotic blog.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.367
- Hey, Mel. Cool off. Outside.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.826
- But what does that even mean?

09:36.868 --> 09:39.412
You saw the symbol.
It was weird.

09:39.454 --> 09:43.083
- It means wake up! Wake up!

09:43.124 --> 09:46.127
You should have had...
Your eye on her!

10:13.571 --> 10:15.699
- Mommy!

10:17.075 --> 10:19.244
- Lumi?

10:25.333 --> 10:26.376
- Mommy!

10:31.506 --> 10:33.216
- Lumi?

10:36.261 --> 10:38.138
Lumi?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.952
- Join me, Mommy.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.797
- We need to talk.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.008
- Okay.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.218
- Oh! Hi, Nolan.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.637
Pancake?
- Hey, Carrie.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.473
Can--can you just give us
some privacy, please?

11:25.477 --> 11:27.145
Cops haven't found anything
out of the ordinary

11:27.187 --> 11:30.482
that might be a lead,
but...I can think of something.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.776
- She's literally
staying to help us.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.320
- Seems like a big coincidence
that the day she showed up

11:35.362 --> 11:37.572
was the day
that my cousin went missing.

11:39.491 --> 11:41.368
I think maybe
we should tell someone.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.495
- Tell the pigs,
put her at risk.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.498
She's scared.
Let's hear her out.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.083
- Tasha. Angel. Queen.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.001
Carrie is just gonna
keep talking in riddles

11:50.043 --> 11:51.753
because Carrie is not well.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.213
- Carrie is not "not well."

11:53.254 --> 11:55.423
Carrie is just not...

11:55.465 --> 11:57.008
well.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.468
- What about last night?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.478
- I mean...yeah.

12:10.605 --> 12:11.564
Yeah.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.693
- We should get moving.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.903
- Can't wait to hear
your plan, Carrie.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.670
- There is something out
in those woods

12:33.712 --> 12:35.463
hunting for livestock.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.298
It takes its victims
back to its nest,

12:37.340 --> 12:39.676
where it milks them for blood.

12:39.718 --> 12:44.305
I believe if I can track it,
I'll find Lumi.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.558
- Nolan, what are you doing?
- Looking for nutmeg.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.767
- Why?

12:47.809 --> 12:49.102
- To get high?

12:49.144 --> 12:51.646
- That's a strategy
that works for you?

12:51.688 --> 12:53.898
Carrie, are you
calling Lumi livestock?

12:53.940 --> 12:56.192
I'm sorry. I'm lost.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.694
There's a big, scary

12:57.736 --> 12:59.195
vampire bear
carving things into trees.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.114
- I'm here to help you.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.158
But I also took
an oath of secrecy

13:03.199 --> 13:05.744
and I owe it to my people
to uphold that oath.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.911
- Mm-hmm.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.080
- But what I can tell you

13:09.122 --> 13:10.665
is how to stop the beast.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.419
One of you must act as its prey

13:14.461 --> 13:17.297
and allow yourself
to be lured into its nest.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.965
- Okay, so we're calling it
a beast now...

13:19.007 --> 13:21.718
- Vampire bear.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.094
Kay.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.931
I will follow from behind...

13:26.973 --> 13:29.142
and take care of the rest.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.436
- Oh, thank you.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.729
Hey!

13:32.771 --> 13:34.939
- Carrie, walk us through
your people's beliefs,

13:34.981 --> 13:36.816
maybe what goes on
at your colony,

13:36.858 --> 13:39.444
because, to us, this sounds--

13:39.486 --> 13:41.905
- Insane.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.615
Not to be rude.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.533
- I can't.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.038
The Colony does bad things

13:50.080 --> 13:51.956
to those
who let their secrets out.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.682
- Don't worry.
I'm not selling anything.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.558
My name's Arthur Dean.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.561
I'm knocking around on behalf
of the Disciples of Dawn.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.022
- I thought you said
you weren't selling anything.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.608
- Oh, gosh, no,
we're not recruiting.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.111
Perhaps you remember me
from the other day.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.780
Lee's Hardware?

14:23.822 --> 14:25.365
- Yeah, I remember you.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.035
- Do you remember her too?

14:30.870 --> 14:33.081
- No, sorry.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.418
- Take your time.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.587
- I've never seen her.

14:41.423 --> 14:43.216
Sorry, sir, I can't help you.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.928
- Tasha...

14:46.970 --> 14:50.849
I'm not going to blame you
for helping a girl out.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.268
I admire your kindness.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.521
But this particular girl
is a cold-souled killer.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.732
Every word that slithers
out of her mouth

14:58.773 --> 15:00.400
is born of pure psychosis.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.278
And frankly,

15:03.319 --> 15:05.280
if you're not careful,

15:05.321 --> 15:07.949
she'll bleed your neck
open in your sleep.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.161
Are you sure she's not
in your house?

15:12.078 --> 15:14.205
- Sir, please leave.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.540
- Not around the corner
in your kitchen?

15:15.582 --> 15:19.085
Or maybe up those stairs there
in your bedroom?

15:20.962 --> 15:22.881
- She took a bus out of town.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.758
I don't know where.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.677
I saw she was scared.
I helped her out. That's all.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.221
- And just ten words ago,

15:30.263 --> 15:32.223
you said you'd never seen her.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.436
- Good luck with your search.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.319
- In case she pops up again.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.826
- Wh--

15:51.868 --> 15:53.370
- You're fine.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.248
- See, I told you
she was in danger.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.210
- We'rein danger.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.629
Didn't you hear him? We are.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.468
- Carrie?

16:10.970 --> 16:14.057
Carrie?

16:14.099 --> 16:15.475
Carrie!

16:24.359 --> 16:26.403
Are you out here?

16:34.285 --> 16:36.663
Carrie.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.915
Carrie?

16:41.751 --> 16:44.170
The man's gone.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.133
- You watched him leave?
- Oh, my God.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.011
- Jesus! Yes. You're safe.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.637
- What did he say?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.305
- He recognized me
from the shop.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.807
Asked if I saw you.

16:55.849 --> 16:59.019
- What did you say?
- I said no, Carrie.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.770
But why should we trust you?

17:03.982 --> 17:05.650
Please.

17:05.692 --> 17:09.404
If you can't trust us now,
why should we trust you?

17:17.203 --> 17:18.538
You must never in your life

17:18.580 --> 17:20.790
tell a soul what
I am about to impart.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.089
- Deep in the woods,
stands a lone door,

17:28.131 --> 17:30.550
not much different
from that one there.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.636
My colony and all of
our practices

17:33.678 --> 17:35.472
exist entirely
to protect the world

17:35.513 --> 17:38.308
from the awful things
beyond that door.

17:38.350 --> 17:41.936
It's what I've trained
for since birth.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.855
But now, since I left,

17:43.897 --> 17:46.649
they worry that our secret
will be unsafe.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.111
They worry
that the wrong person

17:50.153 --> 17:51.696
with the wrong motives

17:51.738 --> 17:55.784
could learn about this door
and breach it...

17:55.825 --> 17:58.828
or somehow
even make a new door

17:58.870 --> 18:01.915
and let all those
awful things go free.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.210
- Carrie...

18:05.251 --> 18:07.128
what's behind the door?

18:10.048 --> 18:11.383
- Nightmares.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.929
Your worst nightmares.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.475
- Mel?

18:20.517 --> 18:22.435
You back here?

19:13.987 --> 19:15.280
- I'll just tell her
respectfully

19:15.321 --> 19:16.740
we don't need her help.

19:16.781 --> 19:19.576
- I promise you,
she won't leave.

19:19.617 --> 19:22.287
Any news?
- Mel's gone.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.455
Out for a smoke.
Poof.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.914
- What do you mean "gone"?

19:24.956 --> 19:27.208
- I see a Hyundai.
I see her cigarettes.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.918
No Mel. Can you come home?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.253
I don't know what's
happening...

19:30.295 --> 19:32.088
But I'm honestly scared.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.506
- Mom?

19:33.548 --> 19:35.050
Mom! Hello?

19:35.091 --> 19:38.094
- I hate to be so right,
but the beast is hunting.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.638
- We saw a lot
of damaging weather

19:40.680 --> 19:42.682
hammering the south
at the end of May,

19:42.724 --> 19:44.601
and while some storms
may have calmed

19:44.642 --> 19:46.770
in some states,
they also may r--

20:09.334 --> 20:11.961
- West Pine residents
are thrilled to find nature

20:12.003 --> 20:14.714
prevailing upon closure
of the local mine.

20:14.756 --> 20:17.300
Jobs in ecotourism
have tripled,

20:17.342 --> 20:20.595
cormorants have returned
to hunt in local streams,

20:20.637 --> 20:23.139
and life expectancy
has shot up.

20:23.181 --> 20:25.892
All thanks
to you, Victoria Frisk.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.578
- I can smell this crap
from my bedroom.

20:45.620 --> 20:46.913
It's bad for you.

20:46.955 --> 20:49.916
- Pay me nine
for the pack then.

20:49.958 --> 20:53.294
- I put a word in
with Cal Gibson, by the way.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.046
Get you started at WPN.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.759
- I'm--I'm doing senior year,
Dad.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.469
- We discussed this.

21:01.511 --> 21:02.721
Worker's comp ran dry.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.556
Your sister and I
need you to show up.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.643
- No. Course.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.937
I will.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.022
I'm sorry.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.317
- You gotta work, man.
- You gotta work?

21:16.359 --> 21:18.153
- Damn...

21:19.404 --> 21:21.614
- God!

21:31.458 --> 21:32.792
Nolan Frisk.

21:34.919 --> 21:35.920
- What--

21:35.962 --> 21:37.047
- I told you
to stay off our block.

21:37.088 --> 21:38.715
- What the fuck?

21:38.757 --> 21:40.550
- I told you what I'd do!
- Get off!

21:47.015 --> 21:49.726
- No way!

21:49.768 --> 21:51.770
- Don't lay a hand
on Nolan again.

21:55.231 --> 21:58.485
Be a good boy now.

21:58.526 --> 22:00.028
- Carrie, that's enough.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.283
I said stop!

22:11.373 --> 22:13.458
- Rhys, go home!

22:13.500 --> 22:15.126
- Good fight, Rhys.

22:15.168 --> 22:18.463
- What is wrong with you?
- You almost had her, bro.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.964
- I don't know. I'm...

22:21.716 --> 22:23.134
I'm sorry.

22:53.665 --> 22:55.917
- Tasha grew up with Rhys.

22:55.959 --> 22:57.210
She'll talk back to him,

22:57.252 --> 22:59.546
but even we fight
about the mine stuff.

22:59.587 --> 23:03.258
Everybody's just worried that
they'll be put out of a job.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.843
Like it's not their boss' fault

23:04.884 --> 23:06.845
for poisoning everyone
in the first place.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.514
- Fear blinds the soul.

23:09.556 --> 23:13.351
- Tattoo it on my forehead.

23:13.393 --> 23:18.773
Hey, I have treated you
the way that they treat me.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.275
I didn't want to admit it,
but...

23:20.316 --> 23:22.152
when I heard
that whistling sound,

23:22.193 --> 23:25.739
"nightmare" is exactly the word
that came to mind.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.907
Hearing it, I felt, like--

23:27.949 --> 23:31.202
- Comforted? Like warm milk.

23:31.244 --> 23:32.746
- Yeah.

23:32.787 --> 23:35.999
And then very, very cold.

23:38.168 --> 23:40.253
- Hey, you guys go ahead.

23:40.295 --> 23:42.589
I'm just gonna make
a quick call.

23:42.630 --> 23:44.716
- You good?
- Yeah.

23:44.758 --> 23:46.509
Good.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.893
- Mom?
- Cover your ears!

23:54.934 --> 23:57.228
- Mom. Mom.

23:57.270 --> 24:00.482
Mom. Mom, stop.
Mom! Stop.

24:00.523 --> 24:02.942
Mom, Mom, look at me.

24:02.984 --> 24:04.694
Mom?

24:04.736 --> 24:06.654
- Mom, are you okay?

24:27.050 --> 24:30.637
- Tasha, it's good you called.

24:30.679 --> 24:32.806
Where is she?

24:32.847 --> 24:34.432
Where are you?

24:36.184 --> 24:39.020
- It's cold! Oh, it's cold!

24:39.062 --> 24:41.106
- Mom. It's Nolan.
Mom!

24:41.147 --> 24:42.816
- It's so cold.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.859
- Mom, Mom, it's me.
It's Nolan.

24:44.901 --> 24:46.820
- It's so cold--
- Mom. Breathe.

24:46.861 --> 24:49.239
- Nolan?
- So...cold!

24:49.280 --> 24:51.658
- Mom, I got you. I got you.
It's me. It's Nolan.

24:54.744 --> 24:57.372
- Oh, my God.

24:57.414 --> 24:59.374
It's real.
