WEBVTT

01:00.060 --> 01:02.396
[RuPaul] Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

01:02.396 --> 01:04.865
You'll be starring in LADP.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.266
[siren]

01:06.266 --> 01:08.068
-Get it.
-Ma'am, ma'am.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.970
Oh!

01:09.970 --> 01:11.805
Ma'am, get off the car.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.074
-Grab him.
-Yeah, oh, yeah.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.510
Oh god, hold on.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.778
I switched roles
with Brooke Lynn

01:17.778 --> 01:20.814
so she would feel
more comfortable,

01:20.814 --> 01:23.350
and it kind of threw me
off my game.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.986
[RuPaul] Vanjie and Plastique.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.988
There was no way
for anyone to get in there.

01:27.988 --> 01:30.257
With both of you,
it was a bit of a free-for-all.

01:30.257 --> 01:34.094
[RuPaul] A'Keria C. Davenport.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.063
You always had
new bits happening.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.365
Working with you was one of the
highlights for me yesterday.

01:38.365 --> 01:41.068
Con-drag-ulations. You are the
winner of this week's challenge.

01:41.068 --> 01:42.269
[applause]

01:42.269 --> 01:44.604
Vanjie, shantay you stay.

01:45.872 --> 01:48.542
Plastique Tiara, sashay away.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.251
Whew.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.252
Bitch.

01:59.252 --> 02:00.887
Oh, Lord, girl.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.556
[Shuga] Plastique
has been eliminated,

02:02.556 --> 02:06.827
and we are just all so surprised
that she is no longer with us.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.462
[Vanjie]
The bitch has nice handwriting.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.297
Not only is she pretty,
but she got pretty handwriting.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.332
That is a true diva.

02:12.332 --> 02:14.401
[Shuga]
How you feeling, Vanj?

02:14.401 --> 02:17.838
Girl, like
I'm not done fighting.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.440
[Vanjie] So I have a lot of
thoughts going through my head.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.009
A lot of the times,
the judges are telling me

02:22.009 --> 02:24.911
you have this natural born gift,
and they'll praise me on that.

02:24.911 --> 02:27.214
But then I go to do that
in a challenge,

02:27.214 --> 02:29.549
and it's almost like,
oh, I just need Vanjie.

02:29.549 --> 02:33.286
I'm trying to figure out
exactly what they want from me.

02:33.286 --> 02:34.988
Like I'm just confused.

02:34.988 --> 02:39.259
[Brooke Lynn]
Congrats, A'Keria.

02:39.259 --> 02:40.727
Who would have thought
your thot twerking ways

02:40.727 --> 02:42.262
would get you a good old win.

02:42.262 --> 02:44.231
Baby.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.033
[laughs]

02:46.033 --> 02:47.501
Do not take that roach with ya.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.070
[all laugh]
They thought you was a roach.

02:50.070 --> 02:53.240
[Silky] I got called a roach
today, bitch.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.941
A roach.

02:54.941 --> 02:57.377
I guess one thing about roaches,

02:57.377 --> 02:58.979
we don't die,
we multiply, bitch,

02:58.979 --> 03:00.280
so get used to me, honey.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.949
I ain't dying
in this competition.

03:02.949 --> 03:04.751
[Shuga]
Brooke Lynn, how you feeling?

03:04.751 --> 03:06.319
You like
redeemed yourself today.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.588
[Brooke Lynn] I did. I feel
fantastic that I'm still here.

03:08.588 --> 03:12.092
I worked really hard,
and it fucking paid off.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.827
Congratulations.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.128
Thank you.
I feel amazing.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.196
I didn't know
what to expect going in,

03:16.196 --> 03:18.598
and I couldn't be more happy.

03:18.598 --> 03:20.000
[Nina] She's talking about how

03:20.000 --> 03:21.668
she was so proud
to be in the top,

03:21.668 --> 03:24.237
but in this challenge, I
worked really closely with her.

03:24.237 --> 03:27.074
She didn't even acknowledge
the work that I helped her with,

03:27.074 --> 03:28.642
and I was kind of like...

03:28.642 --> 03:30.477
that was kind of bullshit.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.711
I mean, I think
Brooke Lynn and I

03:31.711 --> 03:33.280
did a lot
of really good work together,

03:33.280 --> 03:36.183
and I'm proud that Brooke Lynn
was in the top and almost won.

03:36.183 --> 03:38.418
I did. I brought myself
back from the dead.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.020
[Nina] As much as we're friends,

03:40.020 --> 03:43.890
I made some sacrifices
that I probably shouldn't have.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.859
Brooke Lynn is in it to win it.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.194
I have to focus on myself.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.195
Now let's get
the fuck out of drag.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.963
-All right.
-Done.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.665
Done.
[all laugh]

03:51.665 --> 03:54.034
[Yvie] The way it stands
right now,

03:54.034 --> 03:57.571
Brooke Lynn, Silky,
and A'Keria

03:57.571 --> 04:01.374
are leading our pack
with two wins apiece.

04:01.374 --> 04:02.542
Made it out alive.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.244
Ain't gonna be
in the bottom no more.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.480
[A'Keria] There are
girls falling behind.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.082
At this point,
get it together or get lost.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.486
Plane ticket, train ride, Uber.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.921
Go on back to the house.

for today's Mini Challenge,

06:08.401 --> 06:12.138
we're playing a game
called Balls to the Wall.

06:12.138 --> 06:13.373
[all laugh]

06:13.373 --> 06:14.908
[RuPaul] Now each of you
will be paired

with one of these gorgeous,
hot menseses

06:18.445 --> 06:21.748
who are wearing underwear

in the sack fastest wins.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.823
Oh, and one more detail.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.524
You can't use your hands.

06:31.524 --> 06:34.027
Now, instead, I'll pick a card

06:34.027 --> 06:36.396
to determine
each pair's position.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.466
You know, hip to hip,
shoulder to butt,

06:39.466 --> 06:40.767
ass to ass.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.235

Yeah!

06:42.235 --> 06:44.304
Don't worry, girls.
I got this.

06:44.304 --> 06:48.041
Now, Delta, would you be willing
to be our ball girl?

using the blue ball.

07:01.521 --> 07:02.722
Assume the position.

07:02.722 --> 07:05.458
Yes, baby.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.194
My husband's gonna be mad

09:11.885 --> 09:14.554
Ladies,
for this week's Maxi Challenge,

09:14.554 --> 09:18.792
you need to razzle-dazzle,
mystify, and amaze,

09:18.792 --> 09:22.695
as you star
in your very own magic show.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.732
[cheers and laughter]

09:25.732 --> 09:28.935
Now, you'll be performing
in two teams.

09:28.935 --> 09:31.371
Now, Vanjie,
you won the Mini Challenge,

09:31.371 --> 09:34.808
so you get to choose
your magical sisters.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.678
So, Vanjie,
who is your first choice.

09:38.678 --> 09:41.314

09:47.987 --> 09:49.789

And who is your third choice?

09:54.794 --> 09:57.564
I'm going to choose Yvie.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.566
All right, so you're going
to play the race card.

09:59.566 --> 10:02.168
[all laugh]
No.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.805

you are the competing team.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.643
All right.

10:10.643 --> 10:14.581
Now, in addition to performing
professional illusions,

10:14.581 --> 10:18.585
you need to name your magic act,
write captivating patter,

10:18.585 --> 10:20.887
and create a magical look

10:20.887 --> 10:24.624
using makeup provided
by Anastasia Beverly Hills.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.092
[Nina] This is what I do.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.694
I produce and I write shows.

10:27.694 --> 10:28.728
Look out, David Copperfield,

10:28.728 --> 10:29.929
because I'm about to do

10:29.929 --> 10:33.800
the best reappearing act
in this competition.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.102
Challenge agenda.

10:36.102 --> 10:38.771
Our main challenge this week
is a drag magic show.

10:38.771 --> 10:40.240
I cannot wait.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.976
This is a great opportunity
for us to really be cheesy.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.144
We have to essentially
produce a show.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.213
It requires scripting.
It requires producing.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.449
It requires
learning a magic trick.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.184
So this a huge undertaking.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.952
-I think we can turn this out.
-Absolutely.

10:52.952 --> 10:55.021
[Nina] After last week, I don't
want to fade into the back.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.523
I want to be at the forefront.

10:56.523 --> 10:59.392
So let's figure out
what our storyline is.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.729
Like, what's our relationship?
Are we a sister act?

11:02.729 --> 11:05.298
Are we...

11:05.298 --> 11:08.067
like maybe we're like
all left in an orphanage,

11:08.067 --> 11:09.569
and we're left
to our own devices.

11:09.569 --> 11:12.138
And we grow up
in the alleys of Vegas.

11:12.138 --> 11:14.107
I don't know.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.276
So my team
is a team of over-thinkers.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.677
[laughs]

11:17.677 --> 11:19.212
I think
we should be single ladies.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.548
I think we should be older.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.516
We're taking a long time
to get where we need to be.

11:23.516 --> 11:28.187
Oh, my God, what if we're like
three sorority sisters?

11:28.187 --> 11:30.323
-Like in that fall act.
-Yeah.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.926
Our sorority is what?

11:36.362 --> 11:37.997
This is the one thing
I was worried about.

11:37.997 --> 11:40.533
Because Nina loves
to second-guess.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.435
Brooke loves
to get in her feelings.

11:42.435 --> 11:43.870
And I already do that,

11:43.870 --> 11:46.739
so it's like the blind
leading the blind today, girl.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.308
I don't know.
[laughs]

11:48.308 --> 11:50.243
Like, some da-da-da-da-da.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.312
Um...

11:52.312 --> 11:55.782
"You will create a name
for your magic troupe,

11:55.782 --> 11:57.584
the order of illusions, and who
will perform which tricks."

11:57.584 --> 11:59.686
[Yvie] What are some
of the individual illusions?

11:59.686 --> 12:02.655
Okay, so we have
the appearing bra trick.

12:02.655 --> 12:05.725
The milk pitcher trick.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.428
The milk magically vanishes
into to the newspaper.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.696
I kind of want to do the milk.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.931
Okay, so I can do
the appearing bra trick.

12:11.931 --> 12:14.467
This is a whole lot
of abracadabra, bitch.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.768
[all laugh]

12:15.768 --> 12:18.638
Let's create a magical name.

12:18.638 --> 12:21.541
We could make a joke about
how we got all the ethnic girls.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.509
[laughs]

12:23.509 --> 12:26.412
The Dark Sided Magicians
or something?

12:26.412 --> 12:27.747
Black Magic.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.450
I think it should be
Da Black Magic, with D-A,

12:30.450 --> 12:33.086
and when something happens,
say, Da Black Magic.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.288
[all laugh]

12:35.288 --> 12:37.890
[Yvie] But for real, though,
do you guys think

12:37.890 --> 12:40.827
the other team is at all peeved
with how things were split up?

12:40.827 --> 12:42.161
[Silky] If they upset,

12:42.161 --> 12:44.397
they're only upset because
we are Team Personality.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.299
Like let's be honest about it.

12:46.299 --> 12:51.270
Damn, Vanjie, you put all
the girls with the most talent,

12:51.270 --> 12:54.807
the most charm,
the most character,

12:54.807 --> 12:58.478
and the most beauty,
minus Yvie, on the same team.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.214
They destined
to motherfucking fail,

13:01.214 --> 13:03.816
and I live for it.

13:03.816 --> 13:05.585
Hey, cysts.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.720
-Hi.
-Hi, Ru.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.788
How are tricks?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.723
[all laugh]
Business is good.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.593
Shazam, ladies.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.662
-Hi, Ru.
-Hi.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.497
Hi. So you two
have worked together before.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.965
Yes, we have.
Actually quite a bit.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.968
Why do you think Vanjie
didn't you put you on her team?

13:23.936 --> 13:25.438
Aren't you guys very close?

13:25.438 --> 13:26.939
She didn't want
our romantic connection

13:26.939 --> 13:28.141
getting in the way of our work.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.742
Is there really
a romantic connection?

13:29.742 --> 13:31.678
Yeah.
We have a situation-ship.

13:31.678 --> 13:32.712
Have you slipped her the tongue?

13:32.712 --> 13:34.714
Several times.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.649
Really?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.384
Have you slipped her
your pinky finger?

13:38.384 --> 13:40.720
[laughs] My God.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.922
You're making me blush, Ru.
No pinky fingers.

13:42.922 --> 13:44.190
And you weren't shocked

13:44.190 --> 13:46.025
that you weren't chosen
for Vanjie's team?

13:46.025 --> 13:47.927
[Brooke Lynn]
This is a competition,

13:47.927 --> 13:49.429
and I don't expect
anything like that.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.831
I don't expect to be chosen
for her team just because...

13:51.831 --> 13:53.533
You're sticking her the pinky.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.601
[all laugh]

13:55.601 --> 13:57.070
I feel like a 12-year-old girl.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.938
[laughs]

13:58.938 --> 14:01.874
Now, do any of you
have any experience in magic?

14:01.874 --> 14:03.676
-None.
-Really?

14:03.676 --> 14:04.877
I can make my eyebrows
disappear.

14:04.877 --> 14:06.312
Yes, you can.

14:06.312 --> 14:07.747
And that's the magic of drag
right there.

14:07.747 --> 14:10.283
You know, I love drag
because of the magical aspects.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.019
And how we, like Auntie Mame,

14:13.019 --> 14:14.687
can create an illusion

14:14.687 --> 14:18.191
out of some duct tape
and paint and powder.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.059
And that's really
what we want to see

14:20.059 --> 14:21.527
in this challenge, you know.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.763
Do you all have a narrative?

14:23.763 --> 14:25.631
-We have several.
-We have several. Yeah.

14:25.631 --> 14:28.601
I think we're finally deciding
to hone in on one, right?

14:28.601 --> 14:32.805
Yeah, we're trying to work
on a couple--an idea.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.874
Now, you haven't won
any challenges.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.042
Not yet.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.610
How are you going
to make that happen?

14:37.610 --> 14:40.480
You know, I think
I'm a little funny.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.814
I do funny sometimes.

14:41.814 --> 14:42.815
Yeah, no, that's why
you're here.

14:42.815 --> 14:43.816
You've got it all.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.618
It's just how do you excel

14:45.618 --> 14:46.853
with all the other girls
who have it all?

14:46.853 --> 14:48.020
Absolutely.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.255
The judges said that Silky

14:49.255 --> 14:51.190
overshadowed me
in the last challenge.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.525
So for this week,

14:52.525 --> 14:54.227
I have to make sure that
I'm going in as a wrecking ball.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.997
And if I feel like I'm doing
enough, I need to do more.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.834
Hey, colored girl magic.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.770
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.271
I was surprised
you didn't choose Brooke Lynn

15:05.271 --> 15:08.007
because apparently
you two are an item.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.408
I'm not gonna put my man
in my group.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.378
You know, get your own--
go on your side with, you know.

15:12.378 --> 15:13.780
When he had the chance
to pick people,

15:13.780 --> 15:15.348
he picked Nina, and I
wasn't pressed about it.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.416
He's doing good
in this competition.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.785
I need to worry about myself.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.686
I'm thinking what's
going to make me win

15:20.686 --> 15:22.421
and excel in this challenge?

15:22.421 --> 15:25.691
I'm thinking with this,
not with this or this.

15:25.691 --> 15:28.928
Do any of you have experience
with magic?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.631
You know, I made some men
disappear in my day.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.333
[Vanjie] Right, right.

15:34.333 --> 15:38.070
I go from trucker
to a woman in 25 minutes.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.338
Like that is true magic.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.007
Do you really see yourself
as a trucker

15:41.007 --> 15:42.241
before you get into drag?

15:42.241 --> 15:44.610
[all laugh]

15:44.610 --> 15:45.778
I would like to know

15:45.778 --> 15:48.014
what scares you
about this challenge.

15:48.014 --> 15:50.082
Probably what happened
last week,

15:50.082 --> 15:52.418
which was just watching
a train wreck happening,

15:52.418 --> 15:56.522
not being able to stop
the train from wrecking.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.357
Yeah. You started at 10.

15:58.357 --> 15:59.892
There's nowhere to go
from there.

15:59.892 --> 16:04.096
Planning out in advance is going
to be something you need to do.

16:04.096 --> 16:05.598
[Vanjie] Right. I completely--

16:05.598 --> 16:07.099
I want you to know
that I am listening.

16:07.099 --> 16:08.801
I understand
exactly what you're saying.

16:08.801 --> 16:09.936
[RuPaul] Well, listen, ladies,

16:09.936 --> 16:12.205
I cannot wait
to see Da Black Magic.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.372
Let me get right back
to writing.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.640
Let me get back
to writing my script.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.741
All right.

16:15.741 --> 16:18.444
I have a lot to prove still.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.146
I just need to make sure
when we slay this,

16:20.146 --> 16:22.882
that I'm like
slam dunking this thing.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.517
You know, I need to go
Michael Jordan on them.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.152
That's a straight reference
for the people out there.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.955
Superbowl Sunday Beyoncé this.

16:28.955 --> 16:30.756
I need my moment.

16:30.756 --> 16:33.059
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:33.059 --> 16:34.660
How's it going?

16:34.660 --> 16:37.630
[Shuga] It is time for us to
learn some magic tricks, honey.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.998
My name is Kyle Marlett.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.001
I'm a magician and a magic
creator from Las Vegas,

16:42.001 --> 16:44.437
and Ru invited me here
to teach you guys some magic.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.805
You guys all ready
for some magic?

16:45.805 --> 16:47.073
-Yes.
-Yes.

16:51.377 --> 16:52.845
[all] Aah!

16:54.614 --> 16:57.283
All right.
[cheers and applause]

16:57.283 --> 16:59.118
[Kyle] All right, let's get
started doing some magic.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.920
What trick
are you going to be doing?

17:00.920 --> 17:03.623
-I'm doing the swallowing sword.
-Oh, boy.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.992
Now, this one is technically
actually kind of dangerous.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.560
I'm going to show you first.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.165
What?

17:13.165 --> 17:14.367
[Shuga]
Is he really doing this?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.135
-So you actually swallow that?
-Mm-hmm.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.237
[muffled] It's in my throat.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.238
Girl.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.873
What?

17:26.279 --> 17:28.014
Hmm.

17:28.014 --> 17:31.450
So it's like...

17:31.450 --> 17:33.119
Mm.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.855
Now you try. Okay, so go ahead
and put it in your mouth.

17:35.855 --> 17:40.793
And just kind of nom on it,
basically.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.262
Oh, nothing has happened.
Okay.

17:43.262 --> 17:44.630
[all laugh]

17:44.630 --> 17:46.866
I have tricks fail on me
all the time.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.235
But it's important to hide that
in your presentation.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.304
You cover up your mistakes
with comedy.

17:51.304 --> 17:52.505
I'll just ask for the Pit Crew.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.540
Maybe I can try
to swallow those instead.

17:55.641 --> 17:56.876
All right.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.077
We'll move on
to the next person.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.313
Step up up.
[laughs]

18:00.313 --> 18:02.114
I love it, I love it.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.686
Perfect.
All right, the milk trick.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.155
It's very important
that it's 2%.

18:09.155 --> 18:10.423
I'm kidding.
That has nothing to do with it.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.958
[all laugh]

18:11.958 --> 18:14.493
So you can roll it up
into a cone like so.

18:14.493 --> 18:16.629
And now you're going
to take some milk.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.431
You're slowly going to pour it.

18:19.899 --> 18:22.001
Now you say the magic words.
What are the magic words?

18:22.001 --> 18:23.202
-Mm, boom.
-Right, right?

18:23.202 --> 18:25.171
Boom!

18:25.171 --> 18:27.139
-It's gone.
-What?

18:27.139 --> 18:29.308
Oh! Oh, my goodness.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.310
-It's pretty cool, right?
-You ready for me to try it?

18:31.310 --> 18:32.878
Yeah. It's actually
really, really easy.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.180
-I'll tell you when.
-Ooh.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.983
I don't know why you're moaning,
but keep going.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.617
More. More, more.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.519
-Shit.
-Okay. All right.

18:40.519 --> 18:41.654
[all laugh]

18:41.654 --> 18:42.855
Now, you know,
at the end of the day,

18:42.855 --> 18:44.256
you got to let
the trade know, you know--

18:44.256 --> 18:45.825
oops--there's
a little bit there still.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.527
Okay. And now you snap
and say boom.

18:48.527 --> 18:49.762
Boom!

18:49.762 --> 18:51.797
Ain't shit there.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.933
[all laugh]

18:53.933 --> 18:55.668
Where the milk at, bitch?

18:55.668 --> 18:57.069
[Kyle] And what's your
presentation during this?

18:57.069 --> 18:58.771
Your patter and everything.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.072
So, you know, uh,
you know, the gentlemen

19:00.072 --> 19:01.841
like to skeet all over your--
They milk all over your--

19:01.841 --> 19:03.309
your face and stuff.

19:05.044 --> 19:06.812
No more.
Aim for the cone,

19:06.812 --> 19:08.147
and it will be gone.

19:10.516 --> 19:13.352
That's obviously for more
of an adult audience, right?

19:13.352 --> 19:14.654
We gonna have children here?

19:14.654 --> 19:16.722
Work on your script,
work on your presentation.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.158
[Shuga] What I'm noticing
from Team Personality

19:19.158 --> 19:21.627
is that a lot of their stuff
is really off-color.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.396
It's kind of filthy.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.565
The magic show
is supposed to be PG-13,

19:26.565 --> 19:29.335
and right now, it's just
reading kind of tasteless.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.539
So this one's a little tricky,
but it's definitely fun.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.341
So I'll show you first,
all right?

19:35.341 --> 19:36.642
-Okay.
-Glass over here.

19:36.642 --> 19:39.245
Wine bottle here.
Empty tube, right?

19:39.245 --> 19:40.312
Ready?

19:40.312 --> 19:43.649
One, two, and three.

19:43.649 --> 19:46.786
What? Okay,
but how do you do that?

19:46.786 --> 19:49.555
All right, so you try it,
and really fast.

19:49.555 --> 19:50.790
Boom. You did it.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.259
I'm a magician.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.161
I'm trying, I'm trying,
Mary, I'm trying.

19:55.161 --> 19:56.228
Oh, no.

19:56.228 --> 19:57.396
No, that's not right.

19:57.396 --> 19:58.864
That's not what
you're supposed to do.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.232
[all laugh]

20:00.232 --> 20:01.734
I'm really trying
to get my trick down,

20:01.734 --> 20:03.502
and add these nuances

20:03.502 --> 20:06.839
of almost like this
Chris Farley-esque magician.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.441
And what is your presentation
for this?

20:08.441 --> 20:11.343
So won't we look prettier
if we're all drunker.

20:11.343 --> 20:12.411
Shots all around.

20:12.411 --> 20:13.479
That's pretty good, right?

20:13.479 --> 20:14.647
I mean, that's pretty good.

20:14.647 --> 20:15.981
[Yvie] As we watch
the other team,

20:15.981 --> 20:18.884
I'm like, fuck,
they've got humor,

20:18.884 --> 20:21.554
they've obviously
got rehearsed lines.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.457
It's definitely making me
nervous for my team.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.892
[Kyle] All right, we'll move on
to the next person.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.260
So hold this
in your dominant hand.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.329
And take the lid,
put it on top of the pan.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.498
Yep, all the way down.

20:32.498 --> 20:33.999
Do your magic wave,
your presentation.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.936
-Shabam, alacazam.
-Yeah.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.571
Oh!

20:38.571 --> 20:39.839
-Pretty good, right?
-That is great.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.474
So this is a really,
really easy one, right?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.576
So it's all presentation
with this one.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.644
[Shuga] My magic trick,
it's actually pretty easy.

20:45.644 --> 20:46.912
Thank the Lord, honey.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.248
So now I can just focus
on putting on a show

20:49.248 --> 20:51.283
so that it looks like fantastic.

20:51.283 --> 20:53.586
Thank you.
This is amazing.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.193
[snoring]

21:01.193 --> 21:02.862
Yes.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.664
[snoring]

21:05.664 --> 21:07.867
[laughs]

21:09.869 --> 21:11.170
So I'm going to show you
with the playing cards,

21:11.170 --> 21:12.972
but you can use
anything you want, all right?

21:12.972 --> 21:14.306
I will be honest.
This is probably

21:14.306 --> 21:16.242
one of the hardest tricks
that you could do.

21:16.242 --> 21:17.376
[Brooke Lynn] Good.

21:17.376 --> 21:18.944
So I'm glad
you picked this one.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.379
So happy, too.

21:20.379 --> 21:22.381
What?
[laughs]

21:22.381 --> 21:24.116
Where--wh-what?

21:24.116 --> 21:25.885
Take the card.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.386
[Brooke Lynn] What?

21:27.386 --> 21:30.856
Whew. Whooch.
I'll let you try.

21:30.856 --> 21:32.324
So hold it between your fingers.
Give it a spin.

21:32.324 --> 21:34.426
And--okay.

21:35.761 --> 21:37.096
I don't--

21:37.096 --> 21:38.931
I've never seen
this technique before.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.366
[all laugh]

21:40.366 --> 21:42.101
Don't be so awkward, okay?

21:42.101 --> 21:43.135
Just remember, you've got
to use your presentation,

21:43.135 --> 21:44.303
you understand, right?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.105
I don't want you
to be stressed out though.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.339
-I'm not.
-I know magic's hard.

21:47.339 --> 21:49.675
I stress out about everything.

21:49.675 --> 21:52.978
Take the card,
and let me know how that goes.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.681
-All right.
-I hate this.

21:55.681 --> 21:57.216
[Shuga] Brooke is struggling.
She hates it.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.818
She don't want to it.
She can't get it.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.454
She is over this trick.

22:02.454 --> 22:03.689
And we have to be amazing,

22:03.689 --> 22:05.891
because we are up against
Team Personality.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.463
[Nina] I feel really
confident about what I'm doing,

22:11.463 --> 22:13.132
but there's no doubt in my mind
that Brooke Lynn,

22:13.132 --> 22:14.500
after watching the other team

22:14.500 --> 22:16.836
and seeing
gigantic personalities,

22:16.836 --> 22:17.937
I think she's in her head
a little bit

22:17.937 --> 22:19.572
and saying
how do I sell the trick?

22:19.572 --> 22:23.409
This could derail our
whole team's goal of winning.

22:23.409 --> 22:24.577
This is like
a do-or-die situation.

22:24.577 --> 22:25.711
I'm not going home
after the challenge.

22:27.079 --> 22:30.950
[humming]

22:30.950 --> 22:33.352
Disappear, disappear, disappear.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.620
After learning our magic

22:34.620 --> 22:37.022
and watching
the other team's production,

22:37.022 --> 22:40.593
it's quite clear that we need
a hell of a lot more structure.

22:40.593 --> 22:41.994
Ugh.

22:41.994 --> 22:45.331
[Yvie] So we should start
working on the format.

22:45.331 --> 22:46.966
I think yours is going to be
the biggest segment

22:46.966 --> 22:48.500
where we're going
to need to pad it up

22:48.500 --> 22:50.169
since A'Keria's
going to have her mouth full.

22:50.169 --> 22:52.638
Like we should have
some jokes prewritten

22:52.638 --> 22:54.607
so that we
can just pop those out.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.475
[A'Keria] I think it should be
one of those situations

22:56.475 --> 22:57.643
where it just comes
straight off the head

22:57.643 --> 22:59.478
versus us writing it down now.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.983
Well, like, obviously
we can talk and kiki,

23:03.983 --> 23:06.852
but like I think it needs
to be a little organized.

23:06.852 --> 23:08.721
I think it should be
like we casually talking,

23:08.721 --> 23:10.356
and it's just like, you know--

23:10.356 --> 23:13.826
I think we just need like some
transitions between our pieces.

23:15.928 --> 23:18.764
We have some people
that want to improv

23:18.764 --> 23:20.933
and some people that want
to write their parts down

23:20.933 --> 23:23.235
and I'm trying
to people-please everybody.

23:23.235 --> 23:27.172
So I'm not saying we need
to maybe make a specific.

23:27.172 --> 23:29.541
[Yvie]
But like it goes wrong--

23:29.541 --> 23:30.609
[Vanjie]
We need to have something--

23:30.609 --> 23:31.910
[Yvie]
Stuff to lean back on.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.446
But everybody can just
play off of each other,

23:34.446 --> 23:36.081
because we do have
that chemistry.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.917
[Yvie] Silky and A'Keria

23:38.917 --> 23:41.287
want to improv their way through
this whole challenge.

23:41.287 --> 23:44.423
I'm just kind of tired
of fighting all of them.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.558
But in the back of my head,

23:46.558 --> 23:48.694
I still know we need
some more structure.

23:48.694 --> 23:53.065
The only thing I think that does
super need to be written down

23:53.065 --> 23:55.200
and rehearsed is the intro.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.069
Now let's go over
this intro for sure.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.004
[Yvie] Okay. I'm going to
write out these lines then.

23:59.004 --> 24:02.975
My group is a bunch
of strong, opinionated girls,

24:02.975 --> 24:04.743
and I thought that
was going to be the bonus.

24:04.743 --> 24:05.978
It might be the downfall.

24:09.381 --> 24:11.583
[cheering]

24:11.583 --> 24:13.218
Come on.

24:13.218 --> 24:15.387
Oh, Lord.

24:15.387 --> 24:16.989
[Vanjie] Today
is elimination day,

24:16.989 --> 24:20.526
and we have to perform this
magic show for the judges.

24:20.526 --> 24:23.028
I feel like somebody
gonna disappear tonight.

24:23.028 --> 24:24.530
Bippity-boppity-bye.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.498
[Silky]
Can I put my magic in you?

24:26.498 --> 24:28.534
Oh, you can put your magic in me
any time, Silk.

24:28.534 --> 24:29.902
Wherever you want
to put your magic.

24:29.902 --> 24:33.439
Brooke Lynn and Nina are
definitely feeling better today.

24:33.439 --> 24:36.775
We practiced last night.
It came together.

24:36.775 --> 24:38.043
Ah, it's gonna work.

24:38.043 --> 24:39.478
♪ Whoo ♪

24:39.478 --> 24:42.214
[A'Keria] I'm having a bad day.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.216
There's so much
running through my head.

24:44.216 --> 24:45.951
I'm definitely still worried
about my team.

24:45.951 --> 24:49.254
I'm just really like not
in a good space right now.

24:49.254 --> 24:51.357
[Yvie] Hey, Miss A'Keria,
how you feeling?

24:51.357 --> 24:55.594
I'm not in my spirit.
Like I'm just--I don't know.

24:55.594 --> 24:57.062
[Yvie]
Why not? What's the Tee?

24:57.062 --> 24:58.931
[A'Keria] I'm just not
myself right now.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.966
Yeah, because you seem
a little mellow for you today.

25:00.966 --> 25:03.869
Yeah. I'm just
kind of like in my head.

25:03.869 --> 25:07.039
[Nina] I noticed A'Keria
is really down.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.474
Like you can tell
she's frustrated,

25:08.474 --> 25:10.609
and obviously
it's regarding the challenge.

25:10.609 --> 25:12.177
Silk, how you guys feeling?

25:12.177 --> 25:13.545
[Silky]
I'm not sure if I even know.

25:13.545 --> 25:16.348
We basically had to change
our entire show last night.

25:16.348 --> 25:17.516
Why?

25:17.516 --> 25:20.452
Because our jokes
were a little too dirty.

25:20.452 --> 25:22.321
We were too explicit.

25:22.321 --> 25:23.856
Rated R.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.325
[all laugh]

25:26.325 --> 25:27.793
[Yvie] We're just going
to have to make sure

25:27.793 --> 25:30.062
that it's on in there
for the cameras when it counts.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.330
[Nina] Yeah, that's true.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.532
Of course,
the competition mind in me

25:33.532 --> 25:35.834
is like, okay, well, one
of them's got a clipped wing,

25:35.834 --> 25:38.704
and it sounds like they're
working on a completely new act.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.839
So A'Keria could be in trouble.

25:43.342 --> 25:44.743
[Silky]
I got a question for you all.

25:44.743 --> 25:46.745
If we could use magic to
change one thing in the world,

25:46.745 --> 25:47.746
what would it be?

25:47.746 --> 25:49.014
I think by taking away war,

25:49.014 --> 25:50.716
we could solve
so many problems in the world.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.985
[Silky] Brooke Lynn, you're not
competing for a Continental.

25:52.985 --> 25:55.354
Give us a real--[all laugh]

25:55.354 --> 25:57.689
How about if you could
change something

25:57.689 --> 25:59.491
that's happened throughout
this competition so far,

25:59.491 --> 26:00.759
what would it be?

26:00.759 --> 26:02.094
[Yvie] Ooh.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.695
[Shuga] I would have burned
that troll outfit, girl.

26:03.695 --> 26:04.897
Yeah.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.298
You still should.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.833

26:07.833 --> 26:09.234
Shady as hell.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.736
[Silky] What would you
have changed, Vanjie?

26:10.736 --> 26:13.572
If I could go back in time,
I would not pack 46 swimsuits.

27:25.711 --> 27:28.247
[RuPaul] Good on ya, mate.
Hilly dilly.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.848
And Gina Rodriguez.

27:29.848 --> 27:32.017
Now, are you
a Drag Race virgin?

27:32.017 --> 27:33.886
My legs are not crossed
under this table.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.587
[laughs] Prove it.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.923
Rrrrrrr.

27:37.923 --> 27:38.924
So excited you're here.

27:38.924 --> 27:40.526
It's great to be here, Ru.

27:40.526 --> 27:42.227
This week,
we challenged our queens

27:42.227 --> 27:44.696
to put on a drag-tastic
magic show.

27:44.696 --> 27:47.065
And tonight on the runway,

27:47.065 --> 27:49.935
category is Caftan Realness.

27:49.935 --> 27:54.173
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

27:55.607 --> 27:58.677
[cheers and applause]

27:58.677 --> 28:00.279
[RuPaul] Let the magic show
begin.

28:03.749 --> 28:05.150
[Gina] Yes. [laughs]

28:07.019 --> 28:08.387
Ladies and gentlemen...

28:08.387 --> 28:09.888
Boys and girls.

28:09.888 --> 28:12.824
I am Shuga Shablam Alacazam.

28:12.824 --> 28:14.393
And I'm Bubbly Brooke.

28:19.331 --> 28:20.499
[all laugh]

28:22.668 --> 28:23.669
Girl, where is Nina?

28:23.669 --> 28:24.870
Football practice?

28:24.870 --> 28:26.738
[all laugh]

28:26.738 --> 28:28.373
I'm checking her dressing room.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.374
Open sesame.

28:32.611 --> 28:34.413
Girl, she is not
even fucking in here.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.949
Well, like they say
in show business...

28:36.949 --> 28:39.217
-Fuck her.
-No, Mary.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.987
Magic waits for no queen.

28:41.987 --> 28:44.056
-We're titillating.
-We're tantalizing.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.058
We're dudes.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.659
[laughter and applause]

28:47.659 --> 28:50.862
Better late than pregnant,
I always say.

28:50.862 --> 28:53.065
I'm Naughty Nina,

28:53.065 --> 28:55.100
and our journey begins
five years ago,

28:55.100 --> 28:57.936
where three young ladies
had blue eye shadow,

28:57.936 --> 29:01.573
duct tape, and a dream
of...[whispers] magic.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.874
[all laugh]

29:02.874 --> 29:05.811
Now, there are a few rules
at every drag show.

29:05.811 --> 29:08.280
So rule number one:

29:08.280 --> 29:11.249
the more you drink,
the prettier we look.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.685
But, Shuga,
this is a drag magic show,

29:13.685 --> 29:15.120
so I actually think
the first rule is

29:15.120 --> 29:17.055
the more we drink,
the better they look.

29:17.055 --> 29:18.790
Touché.

29:18.790 --> 29:21.426
Which leads us to our first
trick, ladies and gentlemen.

29:21.426 --> 29:25.831
Bippity, boppity,
glug-glug-glug-glug, booze.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.601
We take a bottle of Merlot
and a shot glass.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.104
All I want to do is replace
the bottle with the shot glass,

29:32.104 --> 29:33.472
the shot glass with the bottle.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.340
We all on the same page?
Great.

29:35.340 --> 29:36.675
[all laugh]

29:36.675 --> 29:39.911
I cover the bottle
with this lovely empty canister.

29:39.911 --> 29:41.513
You can shove your fist
in it, too.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.749
It's been lubed with Crisco.

29:43.749 --> 29:47.319
Then we take
this other empty cani--

29:47.319 --> 29:49.321
I'll save this one
for after the show.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.456
We cover our shot glass.

29:51.456 --> 29:54.459
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm
gonna need your help here, okay?

29:54.459 --> 29:57.062
When I count to three, I need
you to say that magical word

29:57.062 --> 29:58.330
that's going to make it
all happen:

29:58.330 --> 29:59.531
tucktastic.

29:59.531 --> 30:01.833
One, two, three.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.201
[all] Tucktastic.

30:03.201 --> 30:05.103
Aah!

30:05.103 --> 30:06.171
Wow.

30:06.171 --> 30:07.439
[cheers and applause]

30:07.439 --> 30:09.374
Magic!

30:09.374 --> 30:10.842
[all laugh]

30:10.842 --> 30:13.078
Shall we do it again?
Do you dare me to do it again?

30:13.078 --> 30:14.813
We will do it again,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.049
One, two, three.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.250
Tucktastic!

30:18.250 --> 30:19.484
Oh.

30:19.484 --> 30:22.387
I think there's an alcoholic
in our midst,

30:22.387 --> 30:23.622
and it's me.

30:23.622 --> 30:27.759
But looks like
I have a bottle for Ross...

30:27.759 --> 30:31.630
a bottle for Michelle...

30:31.630 --> 30:34.132
a bottle for Mama Ru...

30:34.132 --> 30:37.636
a bottle for Gina...

30:37.636 --> 30:39.638
a bottle for Katherine...

30:39.638 --> 30:41.907
a bottle for Brooke...

30:41.907 --> 30:44.376
a bottle for Shuga...

30:44.376 --> 30:46.411
and a shot for me,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:46.411 --> 30:50.115
That is bippity, boppity, boo.

30:50.115 --> 30:52.451
[cheers and applause]

30:54.152 --> 30:58.023
Rule number two is cleanliness
is close to goddessness.

30:58.023 --> 31:01.026
Now, if only there was a queen

31:01.026 --> 31:03.695
who had some dirty,
raunchy tights around.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.599
[all laugh]

31:07.599 --> 31:09.234
Ooh, pee-eew.

31:09.234 --> 31:11.837
How long's it been since
you've washed your tights?

31:11.837 --> 31:14.539
September...2015.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.640
[all laugh]

31:15.640 --> 31:19.244
[grunting] Aah!

31:19.244 --> 31:21.079
Whew. Those are fragrant.

31:21.079 --> 31:22.347
Now I know
what Vanjie feels like.

31:22.347 --> 31:23.648
[all laugh]

31:23.648 --> 31:27.552
These definitely need
some magic detergent.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.921
Ooh, shablam.

31:29.921 --> 31:31.757
-Ooh.
-So does this, girl.

31:33.725 --> 31:38.396
Shuga Slablam. Alacazam.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.665
Fresh tuck panties.

31:40.665 --> 31:42.100
[cheers and applause]

31:42.100 --> 31:43.502
[whispers] Magic.

31:43.502 --> 31:44.503
[all laugh]

31:44.503 --> 31:47.105
That brings us to Rule three:

31:47.105 --> 31:50.442
illusion is everything.

31:50.442 --> 31:53.278
Now, me and these bubbles
have a lot in common.

31:53.278 --> 31:55.180
You see, these bubbles dance.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.516
They are light and flowy
like air.

31:57.516 --> 31:58.884
[whispers] Magic.

31:58.884 --> 32:03.288
We both move with the power
of a thousand seas.

32:03.288 --> 32:04.856
[all laugh]

32:04.856 --> 32:06.258
[whispers] Magic.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.127
The thing we have the most
in common is my tuck.

32:09.127 --> 32:10.128
[whispers] Magic.

32:10.128 --> 32:13.298
You see,
they're soft to look at,

32:13.298 --> 32:15.767
but hard to the touch.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.470
[applause]

32:18.470 --> 32:20.105
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:20.105 --> 32:23.408
no stunt has been pulled on
the Drag Race stage like this

32:23.408 --> 32:26.745
since Valentina said "I'd
like to keep it on, please."

32:26.745 --> 32:28.180
[all laugh]

32:28.180 --> 32:29.681
Now, Brooke Lynn Hytes
doesn't know this,

32:29.681 --> 32:33.051
but she's going to step ever so
gently into this big wooden box.

32:33.051 --> 32:34.619
What?

32:34.619 --> 32:36.288
-Go ahead, baby.
-What's happening?

32:36.288 --> 32:37.522
-Don't worry about it.
-Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.

32:37.522 --> 32:38.590
What--what--what?

32:38.590 --> 32:39.758
Oh, I feel very uncomfortable.

32:39.758 --> 32:42.160
Saturday night for me.
Get in the box.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.663
I feel very attacked
right now!

32:44.663 --> 32:46.631
[all laugh]

32:46.631 --> 32:50.502
Also, Shug, this is a great way
to get it down to a final six.

32:50.502 --> 32:53.505
Amen. Eliminate the competition.

32:53.505 --> 32:54.840
Oh, thank you, dear.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.742
I haven't been on top
in a while.

32:57.742 --> 32:58.810
We know.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.345
[all laugh]

33:00.345 --> 33:01.847
-One.
-One.

33:01.847 --> 33:03.615
-Two.
-Two.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.617
Three!

33:05.617 --> 33:08.520
[cheers and applause]

33:08.520 --> 33:09.721
Magic!

33:09.721 --> 33:12.357
It's a heavy flow day.

33:12.357 --> 33:14.593
Halleloo, I'm back, bitches.

33:14.593 --> 33:15.894
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:15.894 --> 33:18.630
you've just witnessed
the reverse Shangela!

33:18.630 --> 33:20.699
[all laugh]

33:20.699 --> 33:23.034
[Shuga] I'm a little brown
woman in a big brown box.

33:23.034 --> 33:24.035
Oh!

33:24.035 --> 33:25.537
[all laugh]

33:25.537 --> 33:28.139
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

33:28.139 --> 33:31.142
Halleloo times two.

33:31.142 --> 33:34.179
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Bubbly Brooke.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.614
I'm Naughty Nina.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.316
And I'm Shuga Shablam Alacazam.

33:38.316 --> 33:40.385
And together we are...

33:40.385 --> 33:42.621
[all] The Mighty Tucks!

33:42.621 --> 33:43.622
[cheers and applause]

33:43.622 --> 33:45.690
[all] Magic.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.927
Magic...
Magic...

33:48.927 --> 33:50.328
Magic.

33:51.997 --> 33:55.166
And the tricks
just keep on coming.

33:55.166 --> 33:57.369
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.104
Thank you all for coming.

34:03.775 --> 34:07.946
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and squirrels,

34:07.946 --> 34:11.683
I welcome you
to our dark mystical world.

34:11.683 --> 34:14.619
Deeper than my tuck,
but hotter as hell.

34:14.619 --> 34:17.622
It's even worse than a cold
blank stare from Michelle.

34:17.622 --> 34:18.957
[laughs]

34:18.957 --> 34:21.826
Straight from the light
and all that is tragic,

34:21.826 --> 34:23.595
and you'll find my sisters.

34:23.595 --> 34:26.498
We are Da Black Magic.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.134
The Black Magic.

34:29.134 --> 34:31.336
Ooh, Da Black Magic.

34:31.336 --> 34:33.872
Da Black Magic.

34:33.872 --> 34:35.774
[Yvie] Da Black Magic.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.876
Da Black Magic.

34:37.876 --> 34:40.445
-Oh, Da Black Magic.
-Mm-hmm.

34:40.445 --> 34:42.647
Da Black Magic.

34:42.647 --> 34:46.151
[cheers and applause]

34:48.353 --> 34:51.022
I am Yvie the Oddball.

34:51.022 --> 34:53.725
I'm Big Silk Boom.

34:53.725 --> 34:56.161
And I'm Vanishing Vanjie.

34:56.161 --> 34:58.129
All right,
now let's get this--wait.

34:58.129 --> 35:01.099
One, two, three.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.400
Where's Miss Thing?

35:02.400 --> 35:03.835
-She--
-Can we go get her?

35:03.835 --> 35:04.970
She better not be gone.

35:04.970 --> 35:06.171
Bippity bop
and titties that flop.

35:06.171 --> 35:09.441
Look out, girl,
it's Azakazam A'Keria.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.142
-Yeah.
-Oh, girl.

35:11.142 --> 35:14.512
And together, we are...

35:14.512 --> 35:17.649
[all] Da Black Magic.

35:17.649 --> 35:19.584
[cheers and applause]

35:19.584 --> 35:24.022
We are the world's
first troupe of magicians

35:24.022 --> 35:26.558
who travel
from barbeque to barbeque.

35:26.558 --> 35:27.959
It's a little cold
in here, baby.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.594
I'm feeling the breeze.

35:29.594 --> 35:32.430
That's 'cause you don't have
a bra, a panties, anything.

35:32.430 --> 35:34.232
How indecent--

35:34.232 --> 35:35.934
When do I ever?

35:35.934 --> 35:37.168
True.

35:37.168 --> 35:39.304
This is a children's
function, though.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.206
And where there are kids,
there are baby daddies,

35:41.206 --> 35:44.542
which means I can find
the Adam for my Yvie.

35:44.542 --> 35:47.479
But I know it's not easy

35:47.479 --> 35:50.615
to tie the knot.

35:50.615 --> 35:52.017
Look, I did it. I did--

35:52.017 --> 35:53.218
That's a real knot, y'all.

35:53.218 --> 35:55.253
[all laugh]
Come on.

35:55.253 --> 35:57.656
Ooh, now let's see
if I can whip up a bra

35:57.656 --> 35:59.491
for my baby over here.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.627
Ooh...oh...

36:02.627 --> 36:05.630
Bippity, boppity, bra.

36:05.630 --> 36:08.099
[cheers and applause]

36:08.099 --> 36:09.367
Look at this cute

36:09.367 --> 36:12.437
over-the-shoulder
boulder holder.

36:12.437 --> 36:14.372
She'll hold some jugs.

36:14.372 --> 36:16.174
Did someone say jugs?

36:16.174 --> 36:19.477
Jugs of milk...shake?

36:19.477 --> 36:21.046
[all laugh]

36:21.046 --> 36:24.082
My milkshake brings
all the boys to the yard.

36:24.082 --> 36:26.251
And so I gotta get that
to the barbeque

36:26.251 --> 36:28.253
as soon as possible, honey,

36:28.253 --> 36:31.122
so I got to teleport it
with this sheet of paper.

36:31.122 --> 36:34.359
Ooh, baby.

36:34.359 --> 36:37.095
Ahh, baby.

36:37.095 --> 36:38.296
Roll it up, baby.

36:38.296 --> 36:39.564
Wind it, baby.

36:39.564 --> 36:40.999
-Wind it.
-Ooh.

36:40.999 --> 36:44.002
And now we pour.

36:44.002 --> 36:45.637
Oh.

36:45.637 --> 36:49.207
[A'Keria] Oh, girl.
No drop left behind, baby.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.608
[Vanjie] I've never seen you
this concentrated.

36:50.608 --> 36:51.876
Mm.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.813
-Oh, girl.
-She's feeling her Elsie.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.614
[Yvie] Oh, it's still going.

36:56.614 --> 36:58.016
Oh, how much can you fill?

36:58.016 --> 36:59.717
Now let's feel if she's dry.
I feel a little thirsty.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.386
-Thank you, sis.
-I got you, girl.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.054
I got you, girl.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.390
All right, fee fi fo fum.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.392
Look out, throat, here it comes.

37:07.392 --> 37:10.595
Oh, where'd it go, baby?

37:10.595 --> 37:11.930
That's some good shit
right there.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.965
Oh, I know there's going
to be a lot of boys

37:13.965 --> 37:15.900
at this barbeque, honey.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.669
Speaking of the barbeque,

37:17.669 --> 37:19.971
if this bitch don't have
condiments at this barbeque,

37:19.971 --> 37:21.206
I'm gonna beat her ass,

37:21.206 --> 37:23.675
because I had to have
a dry hot dog last time.

37:23.675 --> 37:27.879
Girl, y'all won't believe
what just happened to me

37:27.879 --> 37:30.248
-at the grocery store.
-Tell 'em, boo.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.584
I went in there trying to get
the condiments for the barbeque.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.586
The lady said, ma'am,

37:34.586 --> 37:36.187
whatever you have in that bag,
you didn't pay for.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.289
I said,
what are you talking about?

37:38.289 --> 37:40.291
She said, open up the bag,
show me the ketchup.

37:40.291 --> 37:41.826
I said, what are you
talking about, this?

37:41.826 --> 37:44.929
She said, yeah, that.
You didn't pay for it.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.365
I said, ain't nothing--
no ketchup in here, baby.

37:47.365 --> 37:48.867
I had to get it together,

37:48.867 --> 37:51.269
and I said, look,
what's in the bag, Christine?

37:51.269 --> 37:52.770
What's in the bag?

37:52.770 --> 37:54.439
I know you gagging.
I can see you.

37:54.439 --> 37:58.376
And I said I don't got ketchup
in the bag.

37:58.376 --> 38:02.814
I got mustard in the bag.

38:02.814 --> 38:05.049
Okay, I see y'all are gagged.
Ain't nothing in the bag.

38:05.049 --> 38:07.218
She said, well, flip it
to the other hand, Mary,

38:07.218 --> 38:08.520
if you think you so cute.

38:08.520 --> 38:12.023
I said, okay,
ain't nothing in the bag still.

38:12.023 --> 38:13.925
You know what?
I'm about to show you

38:13.925 --> 38:15.326
what's really in the bag.

38:15.326 --> 38:16.961
Da Black Magic, mama.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.263
Ain't nothing in the bag.

38:18.263 --> 38:20.331
Ain't no ketchup.
Ain't nothing.

38:20.331 --> 38:23.701
Now, A'Keria, what you
bringing to this barbeque?

38:23.701 --> 38:25.003
Oh, girl, you know,

38:25.003 --> 38:26.704
I got to bring to this barbeque
my old trick.

38:26.704 --> 38:28.039
I'm gonna show you

38:28.039 --> 38:29.741
why I am the most popular girl
at the barbeque.

38:29.741 --> 38:32.377
Just gonna pump this
right on up.

38:32.377 --> 38:34.913
All right, just like that.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.848
'Tis a jiggle,
and hip that do, too.

38:36.848 --> 38:39.551
Watch out, y'all, I'm gonna
take this down to the zoo.

38:39.551 --> 38:42.821
[Yvie] Oh, girl.
Oh, my. Ooh.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.660
-How's she doing that?
-I don't know.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.662
[Michelle]
She must be popular.

38:50.662 --> 38:51.996
Oh, you're almost there, girl.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.598
Just the tip.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.733
Girl.

38:57.402 --> 39:00.872
[applause]

39:00.872 --> 39:02.540
You know, it also works
for a low cal diet.

39:02.540 --> 39:04.742
[Vanjie]
Girl, after watching that,

39:04.742 --> 39:07.378
y'all know I got
a little bit of the itis,

39:07.378 --> 39:09.881
'cause that means
you done ate a lot of food,

39:09.881 --> 39:11.015
and you're getting
a little sleepy.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.284
Well, I just got a lot of gas.

39:13.284 --> 39:14.852
Well, lucky for you,

39:14.852 --> 39:18.156
I know the oldest trick
in the Black Magic book.

39:18.156 --> 39:22.026
Okay, girl, you're gonna need to
lay yourself on this magic table

39:22.026 --> 39:23.895
so that
we can get you some rest

39:23.895 --> 39:26.431
that's light as a feather,
but stiff as a board.

39:26.431 --> 39:27.832
Magic table?

39:27.832 --> 39:30.501
Let's wrap her up tight
so she gets that good sleep.

39:30.501 --> 39:32.070
Mm-hmm.

39:32.070 --> 39:36.441
What's the Tee, Christine?

Girl, I think it's time.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.551
Oh!

39:46.551 --> 39:49.554
-All right.

Oh, girl.

I want to serve
100% enlightened monk realness.

41:23.014 --> 41:26.284
Just gliding down the runway
spreading peace.

41:26.284 --> 41:29.554
It's got this train that

41:36.928 --> 41:38.563

mama is feeling

41:52.710 --> 41:54.812
so fierce on this stage.

41:54.812 --> 41:58.249
My caftan is a pantsuit
with butterfly wings.

41:58.249 --> 42:00.184
The fabric is flowing,
and I just feel like

42:00.184 --> 42:02.987
I am going to take flight
at any moment.

42:02.987 --> 42:04.722
[Ross] You butta fly.

42:04.722 --> 42:06.724

42:22.540 --> 42:24.742
Cheetah print head to toe.

42:24.742 --> 42:26.377
I'm a white lady on vacation.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.745
I put that turban on

42:27.745 --> 42:29.714
just in case a little
splash of water, bitch.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.416
I made sure my little
baby hairs are laid down.

42:31.416 --> 42:33.951
I'm looking like when those
bitches go on a vacation,

42:33.951 --> 42:35.620
and they put all their shit on.

42:35.620 --> 42:37.455

It's like

42:51.602 --> 42:53.905
a little bit Sarah
Jessica Parker in Abu Dhabi

42:53.905 --> 42:55.006
in Sex and the City 2,

42:55.006 --> 42:56.674
a little bit Wonder Woman.

42:56.674 --> 42:59.043
I'm just shaking that chiffon
behind me,

42:59.043 --> 43:01.279
and then I just throw it.
Yes.

43:01.279 --> 43:03.614

43:19.464 --> 43:21.599
[Shuga] I am giving you magic

43:21.599 --> 43:23.768
I'm feeling luxurious
in my faux fur.

43:23.768 --> 43:25.436
I'm ready to cuddle up
by the fire

43:25.436 --> 43:27.438
in this gorgeous caftan.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.907
And voila, it is spring, honey.

43:29.907 --> 43:31.843
I am feeling my fruit fantasy.

43:31.843 --> 43:34.178
She is blossoming
all over this runway.

43:34.178 --> 43:37.748
I'm showing you all the legs,
the sun's out.

43:37.748 --> 43:39.784

43:52.196 --> 43:53.498

43:53.498 --> 43:55.967
[Ross] Bea Arthur?
More like A+ Arthur.

43:55.967 --> 43:57.368
-Yes.
-Yes.

43:57.368 --> 43:58.536
[Nina] I'm really
trying to sell

43:58.536 --> 44:00.938
the luxury of this lifestyle

44:00.938 --> 44:05.843
in my elegant Elizabeth Taylor
seventies caftan.

44:05.843 --> 44:07.245
I'm feeling loose and free,

44:07.245 --> 44:09.647
and I can feel the wind
go up my ass, which is amazing.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.382
I haven't felt that in weeks.

44:11.382 --> 44:13.317
This woman is a woman of means,

44:13.317 --> 44:15.987
and she's getting ready
for a busy day of sitting.

44:15.987 --> 44:18.222
[Michelle] Lady Bunny
never looked so good.

44:18.222 --> 44:20.625
[RuPaul] Mm. See you later
at the Regal Beagle.

44:20.625 --> 44:22.026
[all laugh]

44:22.026 --> 44:23.561
[Michelle] Yes, Mrs. Groper.

44:23.561 --> 44:24.729
[all laugh]

44:24.729 --> 44:26.063
All of those references

44:26.063 --> 44:28.165
were too old
for everybody in this room.

44:28.165 --> 44:31.035
[RuPaul] Well, you're
educating children.

44:31.035 --> 44:34.405
Ladies,
welcome to Caftanistan.

44:34.405 --> 44:36.374
[all laugh]

44:36.374 --> 44:38.543
And now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

44:40.444 --> 44:44.782
Starting with the Dr. Reverend
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

44:44.782 --> 44:46.250
When you came out,
it was such a statement,

44:46.250 --> 44:49.420
and I think it made all of us
kind of gasp a little bit.

44:49.420 --> 44:50.788
The eyelashes are crazy to me.

44:50.788 --> 44:52.089
It looks like they're
just in the middle.

44:52.089 --> 44:53.291
So like
if you're looking one way,

44:53.291 --> 44:55.059
it looks like you're
not even wearing a lash.

44:55.059 --> 44:57.495
You were great
in the magic show.

44:57.495 --> 44:59.063
You made me laugh over and over.

44:59.063 --> 45:00.965
The spins were giving me life.

45:00.965 --> 45:03.668
Your connection to the audience
and to everyone

45:03.668 --> 45:05.136
was really, really epic.

45:05.136 --> 45:07.205
Your personality was in it,
and that's what we eat up.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.473
But it seemed messy.

45:09.473 --> 45:12.076
Your jacket looked wrinkly.

45:12.076 --> 45:15.313
Your padding, you could see
the outlines of your hip pads.

45:15.313 --> 45:17.481
Like, girl, we saw everything.

45:17.481 --> 45:20.718
I recognize that I had
body issues in my padding.

45:20.718 --> 45:22.053
Like, I had people
trying to help me

45:22.053 --> 45:24.288
push them down and reshape them.

45:24.288 --> 45:25.423
And my body
just did not work today.

45:25.423 --> 45:26.624
Well, let me
just stop you there.

45:26.624 --> 45:27.959
I mean, there are things
you could have done.

45:27.959 --> 45:29.193
Mm-hmm.

45:29.193 --> 45:31.462
Throw on more tights
so it smooths it out.

45:31.462 --> 45:32.763
At this point
in the competition,

45:32.763 --> 45:34.098
we're splitting hairs.

45:34.098 --> 45:35.566
And these
are the kinds of things

45:35.566 --> 45:38.402
that could get a girl
put into the bottom two.

45:39.904 --> 45:42.206
Up next, Yvie Oddly.

45:42.206 --> 45:44.375
Tonight on the runway,
I absolutely love this.

45:44.375 --> 45:46.043
Givenchy. Very chic.

45:46.043 --> 45:49.146
[Michelle] Your performance
was kind of flat.

45:49.146 --> 45:53.851
There was a tenseness,
you know, at times.

45:53.851 --> 45:55.653
Even though
it sort of came across

45:55.653 --> 46:00.491
that you were a little nervous,
you had really bold choices.

46:00.491 --> 46:01.559
From an actor's perspective,

46:01.559 --> 46:02.994
that's essential
in a performance.

46:02.994 --> 46:06.097
But it seemed to me
like you were thinking

46:06.097 --> 46:08.499
or like you weren't
enjoying yourself.

46:08.499 --> 46:11.068
I guess I was
a little bit stressed

46:11.068 --> 46:13.437
because like we had
to rewrite a lot of stuff.

46:13.437 --> 46:15.406
And in the kindest of ways
to the rest of my team,

46:15.406 --> 46:18.409
I'm the only one
who thinks that way.

46:18.409 --> 46:19.410
Thinks what way?

46:19.410 --> 46:23.748
Uh, in planning things out.

46:23.748 --> 46:24.949
My team was basically like,

46:24.949 --> 46:26.250
well, we work better
with improv,

46:26.250 --> 46:28.319
and it was very obvious

46:28.319 --> 46:31.055
that it didn't work
being improv-ed.

46:31.055 --> 46:35.993
So I wrote
most of our intro, our exit.

46:35.993 --> 46:37.962
If there was a place I was at,

46:37.962 --> 46:39.263
it was just, I guess,

46:39.263 --> 46:40.731
just trying to make sure
that all went right.

46:40.731 --> 46:42.800
All right.
Thank you, Yvie.

46:45.136 --> 46:48.439
Um, Mama, I did not do improv.

46:48.439 --> 46:51.342
So I didn't write down
what I was going to say?

46:51.342 --> 46:53.577
I'm not saying you didn't write
down what you were going to say.

46:53.577 --> 46:55.079
You said the rest of us didn't.

46:55.079 --> 46:57.882
You guys didn't plan
as much as I did, girl.

46:57.882 --> 46:59.750
-That's the Tee.
-I did plan.

46:59.750 --> 47:02.353
I'm not gonna go through that.

47:02.353 --> 47:03.721
[Vanjie] I'm like, girl,

47:03.721 --> 47:05.322
how you gonna sit there
and say that to the judges

47:05.322 --> 47:06.524
knowing that's
the particular critique

47:06.524 --> 47:08.926
that has been given to me?

47:08.926 --> 47:11.696
[RuPaul] Up next,
A'Keria C. Davenport.

47:11.696 --> 47:14.465
I live in Palm Springs, so
I take caftans very seriously.

47:14.465 --> 47:15.466
Okay.

47:15.466 --> 47:17.668
[Ross] I love this outfit,

47:17.668 --> 47:19.203
but a caftan it is not.

47:20.304 --> 47:21.939
I'm sorry to get mad about it.

47:21.939 --> 47:23.441
[all laugh]

47:23.441 --> 47:26.143
Now wait. In my defense,
I Googled caftan.

47:26.143 --> 47:29.380
Now, there's a caftan with a C
and a kaftan with a K.

47:29.380 --> 47:30.915
And I saw some caftans
with pants.

47:30.915 --> 47:31.982
Not in my religion.

47:31.982 --> 47:34.085
[all laugh]

47:34.085 --> 47:35.419
Your magic show was great.

47:35.419 --> 47:37.655
The only thing I would
have wanted to see more of

47:37.655 --> 47:38.989
was when you did your trick.

47:38.989 --> 47:41.425
The way that all four of you
were around,

47:41.425 --> 47:44.829
I would have loved to have seen
more hype from your teammates,

47:44.829 --> 47:47.098
because I think that would have
helped sell the moment more.

47:47.098 --> 47:49.633
[Ross] Your team struggled
a little bit.

47:49.633 --> 47:51.702
I was having a bad day at first,

47:51.702 --> 47:53.337
because there was
a lot going on, but...

47:53.337 --> 47:54.338
What was going on?

47:54.338 --> 47:55.706
Going into it,

47:55.706 --> 47:58.609
we all had the mindset
of the, you know, improv.

47:58.609 --> 48:01.846
At the last minute, some of the
decisions and the routes we went

48:01.846 --> 48:04.515
wasn't going to be suitable
for television.

48:04.515 --> 48:05.516
[laughs]

48:05.516 --> 48:06.917
So at the last minute,

48:06.917 --> 48:09.320
we did have
to rearrange some things.

48:09.320 --> 48:12.123
You cleaned up the magic act,

48:12.123 --> 48:15.326
and the deep throat balloon
stayed in?

48:15.326 --> 48:17.762
[all laugh]

48:17.762 --> 48:19.063
Was it--how dirty was it?

48:19.063 --> 48:20.798
Oh, girl, it was filthy.

48:20.798 --> 48:22.466
[all laugh]
But tasty, too.

48:22.466 --> 48:25.536
Up next, Vanjie.

48:25.536 --> 48:26.704
First and foremost,
I want to say

48:26.704 --> 48:28.906
this is my favorite caftan
up here tonight.

48:28.906 --> 48:30.741
-Aw.
-I would wear that caftan.

48:30.741 --> 48:33.511
Yeah, you look my titi Sepha,
my titi--

48:33.511 --> 48:36.814
Girl, I was already thinking
we look family, mama.

48:36.814 --> 48:38.315
Don't do it to me.
[all laugh]

48:38.315 --> 48:39.316
It's to die for.

48:39.316 --> 48:40.718
The challenge, though.

48:40.718 --> 48:42.853
I didn't really get much
from the performance,

48:42.853 --> 48:44.722
and when you did talk,
I was like there's Vanjie.

48:44.722 --> 48:46.357
Wait. Right.

48:46.357 --> 48:48.125
There's no character
development.

48:48.125 --> 48:49.126
Okay, yeah.

48:49.126 --> 48:50.694
I feel like we hit a wall.

48:50.694 --> 48:53.097
I did write down
what I wanted to say

48:53.097 --> 48:54.632
and what I was going to do.

48:54.632 --> 48:57.635
Like I've been trying
really hard to push myself.

48:57.635 --> 49:00.271
Like whatever critiques
you guys say, I do listen.

49:00.271 --> 49:03.607
And, um, that's why
I went a different route

49:03.607 --> 49:06.076
with just writing it down
and stuff.

49:06.076 --> 49:07.511
That's not the problem.

49:07.511 --> 49:12.149
There's gotta be some kind
of elevation in performance.

49:12.149 --> 49:13.384
It's just at this level.

49:13.384 --> 49:16.487
You need to give us more
or else it's done.

49:17.988 --> 49:19.490
Thank you, Vanjie.

49:21.525 --> 49:23.928
Up next, Brooke Lynn Hytes.

49:23.928 --> 49:26.130
Let's talk about
this runway look.

49:26.130 --> 49:29.233
I love it so much.
I wish I had a gold bra.

49:29.233 --> 49:30.634
[all laugh]

49:30.634 --> 49:32.436
I was really captivated
by the way that you walked.

49:32.436 --> 49:36.674
Whipping it around,
leg out, pose, turn.

49:36.674 --> 49:38.075
It was delicious.

49:38.075 --> 49:41.579
And that magic show
was phenomenal.

49:41.579 --> 49:42.780
Really, really funny.

49:42.780 --> 49:44.615
[Michelle] They were
realized characters,

49:44.615 --> 49:47.618
you had choreography,
which I'm attributing to you.

49:47.618 --> 49:50.988
I laughed the entire time.

49:50.988 --> 49:53.757
[ Katherine] And one of my notes
I wrote for you was,

49:53.757 --> 49:54.825
baby, you're a star.

49:54.825 --> 49:55.826
Oh.

49:55.826 --> 49:58.562
[RuPaul] Up next, Shuga Cain.

49:58.562 --> 50:00.531
You look absolutely
beautiful in this.

50:00.531 --> 50:02.032
It's Game of Thrones.

50:02.032 --> 50:05.269
Like, it's just giving me
queen everything.

50:05.269 --> 50:07.271
I wish you would have
kept this on.

50:07.271 --> 50:10.641
I felt like it got
progressively not as cute.

50:10.641 --> 50:15.212
In the magician's production,
you weren't bad,

50:15.212 --> 50:18.515
but you paled in comparison
next to two juggernauts.

50:18.515 --> 50:21.118
It was not quite good enough.

50:21.118 --> 50:24.655
[Ru] There was a point where
you had a few jokes to land,

50:24.655 --> 50:26.824
but you never quite landed
those jokes.

50:26.824 --> 50:29.126
You guys did a better job
than the other team.

50:29.126 --> 50:32.263
You always want to be
on the best team,

50:32.263 --> 50:35.099
but the risk
is being overshadowed.

50:36.700 --> 50:38.535
[RuPaul] Up next, Nina West.

50:38.535 --> 50:40.571
Tonight on the runway,
it's exactly the caftan

50:40.571 --> 50:45.075
that I've been dreaming of
my entire life.

50:45.075 --> 50:48.679
I really enjoyed your
performance in The Mighty Tucks.

50:48.679 --> 50:50.014
Magic!

50:50.014 --> 50:53.884
The eighties shoulder pads,
the life was everything.

50:53.884 --> 50:55.619
Obviously
Brooke Lynn's a dancer,

50:55.619 --> 50:58.455
and you're back there cheesing
it up just as much as she is.

50:58.455 --> 50:59.957
I was dying of laughter.

50:59.957 --> 51:03.961
You were, from the beginning
to the end, hysterical.

51:03.961 --> 51:05.829
[Katherine] Your energy
was so up,

51:05.829 --> 51:07.097
and your command of the stage

51:07.097 --> 51:09.099
and what you were doing
was great to watch.

51:09.099 --> 51:10.334
[Ross] It was so funny.

51:10.334 --> 51:12.336
And you created
this other character.

51:12.336 --> 51:14.571
That's how you do it.
Thumbs up to you.

51:14.571 --> 51:18.542
[all laugh]

51:18.542 --> 51:19.610
[RuPaul] Thank you, ladies.

51:19.610 --> 51:20.945
I think we've heard enough.

51:20.945 --> 51:23.347
While you untuck backstage,

51:23.347 --> 51:25.349
the judges and I
will deliberate.

51:26.750 --> 51:28.886
All right, now, just between
us squirrel friends,

51:28.886 --> 51:32.790
I wanna know what you have
to say about my girls.

51:32.790 --> 51:35.292
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

51:35.292 --> 51:36.727
She really kept the energy high,

51:36.727 --> 51:39.430
and her personality
definitely shone through.

51:39.430 --> 51:40.798
She was counting on her charm.

51:40.798 --> 51:42.232
Now, I bought it,

51:42.232 --> 51:44.068
but I couldn't get over looking
at how sloppy she looked.

51:44.068 --> 51:46.036
It really was messy.

51:46.036 --> 51:47.171
It just didn't work for me.

51:47.171 --> 51:49.473
You gotta come strong
all the time.

51:49.473 --> 51:50.774
[RuPaul] Yvie Oddly.

51:50.774 --> 51:52.276
[Katherine] Yvie seemed
a little nervous to me

51:52.276 --> 51:54.111
on stage tonight
for the magic show.

51:54.111 --> 51:56.013
I felt like she was just
thinking about the words,

51:56.013 --> 51:58.682
getting it done, and then moving
to the side of the stage.

51:58.682 --> 52:01.618
If she was the one that wrote
something to open and close,

52:01.618 --> 52:02.853
then she could have been

52:02.853 --> 52:05.422
the only saving grace
in that performance.

52:05.422 --> 52:07.057
Didn't look like the other girls
thought it was true, though.

52:07.057 --> 52:09.326
Did you see Vanjie?
She was not having that.

52:09.326 --> 52:10.327
[Gina] Well, yeah,
there was disconnect

52:10.327 --> 52:11.462
definitely in that group,

52:11.462 --> 52:13.130
and you felt it
in the performance.

52:13.130 --> 52:15.199
[RuPaul] A'Keria C. Davenport.

52:15.199 --> 52:17.067
The team had a bit of
a tough time cohesively

52:17.067 --> 52:18.302
putting that performance
together,

52:18.302 --> 52:20.237
but I'd really like
to see more of her.

52:20.237 --> 52:22.539
Tonight on the runway,
it's a caftan challenge,

52:22.539 --> 52:24.074
and there's nary a caftan
to be found.

52:24.074 --> 52:26.543
You know, some of these caftans
were so good

52:26.543 --> 52:27.644
they were making me pant.

52:27.644 --> 52:29.380
Like...[pants]

52:29.380 --> 52:31.749
But A'Keria
was making me...pant?

52:31.749 --> 52:33.317
[laughs]

52:33.317 --> 52:34.852
I don't know if I've ever been
this mad in my entire life.

52:34.852 --> 52:36.520
[all laugh]

52:36.520 --> 52:38.756
Caftan it was not.

52:38.756 --> 52:40.391
Let it go, Ru.

52:40.391 --> 52:43.160
[all laugh]

52:43.160 --> 52:45.162
[RuPaul] Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

52:45.162 --> 52:47.131
This has been week
after week after week

52:47.131 --> 52:48.766
where we're trying
to get character development,

52:48.766 --> 52:50.167
and we're not.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.869
[Katherine] Her personality
is definitely something

52:51.869 --> 52:53.270
that is really magnetic.

52:53.270 --> 52:56.073
[Ross] I just find her so
interesting and so funny.

52:56.073 --> 52:58.742
But I don't disagree
that at a certain point

52:58.742 --> 53:01.912
you've gotta bring more
than just one gear.

53:01.912 --> 53:03.080
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes.

53:03.080 --> 53:05.249
She's been great
in this competition.

53:05.249 --> 53:07.551
I feel very attacked right now!

53:07.551 --> 53:11.522
And nobody owned the runway
like she did tonight.

53:11.522 --> 53:14.858
The dance background she has
has really come in handy.

53:14.858 --> 53:16.460
[Gina]
Brooke Lynn is a star.

53:16.460 --> 53:18.128
Not just kind of, sort of.

53:18.128 --> 53:19.630
She is a star.

53:19.630 --> 53:20.864
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

53:20.864 --> 53:22.433
Shuga gave me comedy blue balls.

53:22.433 --> 53:24.501
You know, when it came time
for her punchline,

53:24.501 --> 53:26.036
I was right there ready for it.

53:26.036 --> 53:27.337
So does this, girl.

53:27.337 --> 53:29.306
It just didn't happen.

53:29.306 --> 53:31.909
On the runway, she went
from pretty to worse

53:31.909 --> 53:33.310
to, no, girl, stop.

53:33.310 --> 53:36.280
She was the least favorite
of that group,

53:36.280 --> 53:38.248
and the runway as well.

53:38.248 --> 53:41.985
In this competition, she's
not really hit her mark yet.

53:41.985 --> 53:43.420
Nina West.

53:43.420 --> 53:44.788
For me, she was
a real standout tonight.

53:44.788 --> 53:46.957
It was literally a sketch
from Saturday Night Live.

53:46.957 --> 53:48.025
It was that good, you guys.

53:48.025 --> 53:49.860
We know.

53:49.860 --> 53:53.664
I just want to cast her in the
lead of a TV show immediately.

53:53.664 --> 53:55.833
She slammed the performance
out of the park.

53:55.833 --> 53:57.868
Grand slam,
bring everybody home.

53:57.868 --> 53:59.203
Nina West at the plate.

53:59.203 --> 54:00.571
That was a sport reference.

54:00.571 --> 54:04.475
