Now, that's not true, really.

to frame the agreement.

really happened or I dreamt it later

you were in the throes of passion.

- Yeah, I know.
- So then you were aroused.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.752

13:38.901 --> 13:41.220
but then she left the room and I was...

13:41.362 --> 13:44.261
I mean... I came down. You know?

13:44.407 --> 13:46.009

somebody else on the job for a while.

I still wouldn't ask that person

Yeah.

01:34:57.317 --> 01:35:00.170
Well, actually,
I live up right around here.

01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.514
Do you wanna come up? You can join me.

01:35:02.655 --> 01:35:04.052
Okay.

01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:09.058
Well, I was born in Philadelphia,

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:13.354
but I've been a New Yorker now
for going on 10 years.

01:35:13.499 --> 01:35:15.601
What about you?

01:35:15.752 --> 01:35:17.775
- Ah, nice.

01:35:17.921 --> 01:35:20.365

01:35:24.761 --> 01:35:26.158
This?

01:35:27.764 --> 01:35:32.620
It's like I started saying before,
I turned into a vampire last week.

01:35:32.769 --> 01:35:37.124
It's all in the past, though.
You okay? You know...

01:35:43.321 --> 01:35:45.640
(GASPS) There he is.

01:35:45.782 --> 01:35:48.135
Nah, I don't wanna
talk about it anymore.

01:35:48.284 --> 01:35:51.604
I mean, it's all from
a very unhappy period in my life

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:55.942
and I don't wanna talk about it.
End of subject, okay?

01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:01.235
Sharon...

01:36:01.381 --> 01:36:04.451

(ALVA WHIMPERING)

01:36:23.236 --> 01:36:25.259
You don't let up, do you, cunt?

01:36:25.405 --> 01:36:27.849
I mean, you just keep harpin'

01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:31.470
and harpin' over the same goddamn thing.

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:33.721
(IMITATES WOMAN)
"Why did you become a vampire?

01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:35.939
Why couldn't you be normal?

01:36:36.082 --> 01:36:38.901
Well, Peter, does this mean
we can never have children?"

01:36:53.683 --> 01:36:55.660
'Cause there's no way in hell

01:36:55.810 --> 01:36:58.163
that I would ever, ever marry

01:36:58.313 --> 01:37:01.041
a loudmouth pig like you.

01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:03.463
'Cause in the 10 minutes I'm with you

01:37:03.609 --> 01:37:07.088
and the shit just starts right up.

01:37:07.238 --> 01:37:10.558
What? What?

01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:13.144
You hate my guts?

01:37:13.286 --> 01:37:14.683
You wanna go home?

01:37:14.829 --> 01:37:17.227
You wanna leave? Good. Fine.

01:37:35.391 --> 01:37:37.960
Get the hell out of here,
you fucking pig!

01:37:38.102 --> 01:37:40.921
Leave me the fuck alone!

01:37:44.609 --> 01:37:47.087
I really can't handle
these relationships.

01:37:47.236 --> 01:37:49.885
Maybe I should see a shrink.

01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:52.099

(GURGLES)

01:39:21.664 --> 01:39:25.564
Dream of me, my angel.

01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:27.904
Dream of me.
