00:03.371 --> 00:04.738
PRIDE:
Baitfish. He's back.

00:04.772 --> 00:06.374
Each body that I follow
leads me to another one.

00:06.407 --> 00:07.007
Baitfish is up to something.

00:07.041 --> 00:08.676
I-I just don't know what.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.511
I've seen you
in this mode before.

00:10.544 --> 00:11.679
The "nothing else matters"
look,

00:11.712 --> 00:14.248
the not sleeping, not eating.

00:14.282 --> 00:17.118
You withdraw.
You shut the world out.

00:17.151 --> 00:20.621
He almost killed my daughter.
I need to find him and end this.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.223
Should've let
Baitfish burn, Sasha.

00:22.256 --> 00:25.059
They arrest him,
he gives them us.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.294
He's planning a hit.
Target?

00:26.327 --> 00:28.129
Someone in town.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.730
Still trying to figure out who.

00:29.763 --> 00:32.066
Where's Lasalle?

00:32.100 --> 00:33.801
I need to get a message
to his boss.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.103
I don't know.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.504
You'll do.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.222
PRIDE:
Christopher.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.192
Chris?

01:03.231 --> 01:06.300
You hear me?

01:07.435 --> 01:08.769
Can you tell me what happened?

01:11.372 --> 01:14.308
I dropped Cade off
at the bus station.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.412
I stopped to pick up wine.

01:20.414 --> 01:24.118
And when I came here...

01:24.152 --> 01:26.420
I found Savannah
like...

01:26.454 --> 01:27.755
this.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.457
I found her like this.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.492
What time was that?

01:31.525 --> 01:34.562
It was about 9:00. 9:15.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.699
I thought I could save her.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.470
But...

01:42.503 --> 01:43.471
She was gone.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.609
Yeah, I stopped to get wine.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.412
Okay. Come on.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.681
Stay here, all right?
I'll be right back.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.716
Okay?

02:10.498 --> 02:12.633
Last few weeks,
that boy has drawn

02:12.666 --> 02:15.236
every bad card in the deck.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.337
You get anything?

02:16.370 --> 02:18.339
We found a bloody fingerprint

02:18.372 --> 02:19.873
on her wrist.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.544
Pride,

02:23.577 --> 02:24.845
it's Baitfish.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.414
It's Paul Jenks.

02:26.447 --> 02:29.250
That doesn't make
any sense.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.521
Coming after me,
I understand that.

02:33.554 --> 02:37.325
But... Christopher?

02:37.358 --> 02:38.526
Savannah?

02:38.559 --> 02:39.727
He made quick work of her,
Dwayne.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.863
Single gunshot wound
to the chest.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.398
Close range. Small caliber.

02:46.434 --> 02:47.835
Savannah was shot here?

02:47.868 --> 02:49.670
WADE:
No. Judging by the drops

02:49.703 --> 02:52.873
on the floor, I'd say he dragged
her over here postmortem.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.376
He moved her...

02:55.409 --> 02:57.245
in front of the window?

02:57.278 --> 03:00.248
Why the hell would he...

03:00.281 --> 03:02.516
Get down!

03:10.824 --> 03:12.826
(gunfire stops,
people clamoring)

03:14.528 --> 03:17.298
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

03:17.331 --> 03:19.733
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

03:19.767 --> 03:22.436
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

03:22.470 --> 03:23.504
* How, how, how, how

03:23.537 --> 03:25.873
* Hey, hey

03:31.712 --> 03:33.314
* You gotta come on.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.386
BRODY:
Pride.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.622
Lasalle and SWAT are searching
for the shooter's nest.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.624
NOPD has cordoned off
a square mile.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.626
Got eyes in the sky.
He's gone.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.761
This was all a setup.

03:47.795 --> 03:51.299
Got to believe he thought
through his escape route.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.333
Everyone's
accounted for?

03:52.366 --> 03:54.034
Two dead, both cops.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.537
Four wounded-- on their way
to University Hospital.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.939
Make that five.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.009
You're bleeding.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.745
Let's see.
Easy, easy.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.615
Oh, that's
a deep cut.

04:07.648 --> 04:10.618
Most likely glass.
Need some assistance here.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.421
It's fine. I'm not leaving.
You don't have a choice.

04:13.454 --> 04:14.588
Get it looked at right now.

04:14.622 --> 04:15.989
Thank you, fellas.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.328
LASALLE:
King.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.895
Christopher.

04:21.929 --> 04:25.032
AK-47. Found it in the empty
apartment across the street.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.635
Second floor,
top left-hand corner.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.605
We were sitting ducks.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.607
I'll talk to the SWAT
team, see what they know.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.742
Hang on.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.877
I'm not letting this guy
get away, King.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.512
Look at me, Christopher.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.449
We'll get him.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.956
What the hell happened today?

04:51.124 --> 04:53.561
You said Baitfish was
prepping for a hit.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.829
The hit was
on my people.

04:55.863 --> 04:58.966
Yo. They okay?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.601
Two cops are dead.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.538
And Lasalle's girlfriend.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.874
The mermaid?

05:06.907 --> 05:09.443
Damn.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.445
Where is he, Sonja?

05:11.479 --> 05:12.980
Where's Baitfish?

05:13.013 --> 05:15.716
I-I'm barely part
of the crew.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.919
I don't know his location.
I just get texts.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.855
Should have grabbed him
when we had the chance.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.691
You never had that chance.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.693
Guy's a fugitive.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.596
Paranoid-- it's all
burner phones and code words.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.531
I'm giving you a tail.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.733
The hell you are.

05:32.766 --> 05:37.538
If Baitfish spots any backup,
he's gone for good.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.540
You put me
on this guy.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.943
Said let Baitfish lead us to
Sasha Broussard, the syndicate.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.778
Wrap 'em all up together.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.614
That was the plan.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.782
Well, the plan's changed.
The guy's a cop killer.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.751
Which is why
I'm not letting you pull me out.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.354
Not letting me?

05:55.756 --> 05:56.757
Look,

05:56.790 --> 05:59.427
you can keep track of me
on this.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.863
GPS will tell you
where I am at all times.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.466
Check in every two hours.

06:05.499 --> 06:08.402
Go.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.571
Be safe.

06:36.697 --> 06:37.865
Pride.

06:37.898 --> 06:38.832
Still alive, huh?

06:40.801 --> 06:43.671
I figured I had a 50/50 shot.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.739
Where you at, Baitfish?

06:45.773 --> 06:47.675
I'll come by.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.209
Give you another chance.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.612
Not your Baitfish anymore.

06:51.645 --> 06:52.713
Sure, you are.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.916
Grown into a whale, didn't I?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.685
Your partner's girlfriend,

06:57.718 --> 07:01.722
those cops-- just a preview.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.157
Harder you come at me,
the more bodies drop.

07:04.191 --> 07:07.094
That's a guarantee.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.763
How much pain
can you take, Pride?

07:09.797 --> 07:11.632
No. Question is:

07:11.665 --> 07:13.634
how much pain can you?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.803
Hear me.

07:15.836 --> 07:19.039
I will never stop
until I end you.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.188
NOPD is expanding the radius.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.758
Got every cop in New Orleans
looking for that bastard.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.026
He called
a couple hours ago.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.761
Said this thing
is far from over.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.696
He's playing games.

07:42.730 --> 07:43.697
Loretta.

07:43.731 --> 07:44.832
Dwayne.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.767
Merri, how's the arm?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.201
Couple stitches. Good to go.

07:48.235 --> 07:51.004
Well, I wish I could say
the same for your boy.

07:51.038 --> 07:54.575
Savannah's father Peter.
Drove down from Alabama.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.946
As suspected,

07:58.979 --> 08:02.182
Savannah was killed with
a single bullet to the chest.

08:02.215 --> 08:05.519
Contact abrasions
on the entry wound indicate...

08:05.553 --> 08:08.188
A silencer.
Baitfish's signature.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.157
How about the
other victims?

08:10.190 --> 08:11.825
Come.

08:11.859 --> 08:15.663
I have my findings
pulled up in Sebastian's lab.

08:15.696 --> 08:20.000
Officer Jensen was shot multiple
times in the neck and head.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.636
Officer Reeves,
on the other hand,

08:22.670 --> 08:23.704
was shot once

08:23.737 --> 08:25.706
in the abdomen
and by all accounts

08:25.739 --> 08:26.940
should have survived.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.175
Why didn't he?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.578
The round fragmented
inside his body.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.780
The pieces spread like cancer,

08:32.813 --> 08:35.148
causing
massive internal bleeding.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.884
It sounds like...
SEBASTIAN: Some kind
of hollow

08:36.917 --> 08:38.786
That's what I thought, too,
except these rounds cut

08:38.819 --> 08:40.754
through their Kevlar vests
like they were butter.

08:40.788 --> 08:43.156
Never seen anything like it.
Can you run it through NIBIN?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.892
Won't know until I put one
back together.

08:44.925 --> 08:45.926
So stay tuned.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.031
With help from the Federal
Marshal Service, Captain Messier

08:51.064 --> 08:53.867
and our friends at NOPD,
we're monitoring all airports,

08:53.901 --> 08:57.037
bus stations and train depots
in Southern Louisiana.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.640
Also pulling Jenks' known
associates off the street.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.610
If Jenks as much as nodded hello
to one of 'em,

09:02.643 --> 09:03.777
they'll be in custody.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.245
PRIDE:
Baitfish knew if he took

09:05.278 --> 09:08.081
a shot at us,
we'd shut the city down.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.751
Be impossible
for him to get away.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.085
Maybe he doesn't want
to get away.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.320
Trace on that phone call
he made you

09:13.353 --> 09:14.988
was from a local cell tower.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.257
You don't target
cops and stay put.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.260
Yet he has. Why?

09:20.293 --> 09:22.596
Councilman.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.832
Dwayne.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.068
Might we chat?

09:28.101 --> 09:30.237
Automatic gunfire

09:30.270 --> 09:31.705
in the Quarter.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.240
Huh? Cops, federal agents

09:33.273 --> 09:36.009
being used for
target practice.

09:36.043 --> 09:39.179
I was there.
But thanks for the recap.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.815
What can I do to help?

09:41.849 --> 09:46.119
Save your sincere concern
for your press conference.

09:46.153 --> 09:49.356
I am not putting on an act;
I'm offering a hand.

09:49.389 --> 09:52.325
You got some kind
of angle here?
Oh, well,

09:52.359 --> 09:53.994
if we're casting aspersions,
I could point out

09:54.027 --> 09:55.262
that Paul Jenks
was your informant.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.797
You created him.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.699
And the only way
I can come close

09:58.732 --> 10:00.801
to making this right
is by catching him.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.870
So if you'll excuse me!
I spent the morning

10:02.903 --> 10:04.872
with two families
that lost sons last night,

10:04.905 --> 10:07.708
and I did not know
what to say to them.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.342
Lasalle lost somebody here, too.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.847
No matter what you think of me,

10:13.881 --> 10:16.817
I love this city.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.223
Sebastian has info
on the bullets.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.392
Take Christopher.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.994
All right.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.885
Get in.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.387
Get in.

10:57.024 --> 11:00.327
Hands on the wheel.
Act casual.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.430
Eyes up front.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.768
Been waiting to hear from you.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.136
Here I am.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.971
Gonna conversate?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.840
Or is this just one of those

11:12.873 --> 11:15.342
comfortable silences
between friends?

11:18.879 --> 11:20.247
We friends?

11:20.280 --> 11:23.083
Look, I had a pile of your
pills free and clear.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.819
Could've taken them
and made bank,

11:25.853 --> 11:28.922
but I think you're going
places and I want in.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.862
Got a lot on my plate.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.765
You'll understand
if I got trust issues.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.908
Ever hijacked a truck?

11:47.941 --> 11:50.878
SEBASTIAN: I've been trying
to reconstruct the bullets

11:50.911 --> 11:52.312
that Dr. Wade pulled
from the victims.

11:52.345 --> 11:55.048
What'd you learn?
They were shattered.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.183
I'm talking Enterprise
at the end of

11:56.216 --> 11:58.051
Search for Spock shattered.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.420
Which means...?
Well, it means that
like the Enterprise

12:00.453 --> 12:02.956
at the end of Voyage Home,
I was able to reconstruct

12:02.990 --> 12:05.258
one of the bullets
just enough to analyze it.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.060
But it doesn't matter, 'cause
they're never gonna get a match

12:07.094 --> 12:09.196
in NIBIN anyway.
You want to know why?

12:09.229 --> 12:12.065
As long as the answer doesn't
include a Star Trek reference.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.934
Well, it won't now.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.435
Not gonna get a hit
in NIBIN because

12:15.468 --> 12:17.404
these are blended-metal bullets.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.907
Composed of copper,
tungsten and brass,

12:19.940 --> 12:21.909
they're incredibly rare
and extremely lethal.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.912
I mean, these things
cut through steel, rock, wood.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.247
But they shatter on impact
with human flesh.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.949
I mean,
the metal compounds

12:28.982 --> 12:31.018
come apart inside the body,
creating this almost

12:31.051 --> 12:32.986
untreatable wound.
How does somebody

12:33.020 --> 12:34.922
get ahold of this
kind of ammunition?

12:34.955 --> 12:36.289
Well, the bullets themselves
were manufactured

12:36.323 --> 12:38.558
by a South African
munitions firm in 2003,

12:38.591 --> 12:40.327
but they were deemed illegal
by the Hague.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.562
Every last round was supposed
to be seized and destroyed.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.563
Seized by who?

12:43.596 --> 12:46.166
The United States Navy.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.501
PRIDE:
Blended metal bullets.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.138
In January, the Navy seized
the contraband in an operation

12:51.171 --> 12:53.273
in Kunar Province--
5,000 rounds.

12:53.306 --> 12:56.043
They were transferred to Bagram
Air Base to be destroyed.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.510
But they
weren't destroyed?

12:57.544 --> 13:00.013
Rounds were stolen off
the base three weeks ago.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.049
Marine guard on post
had his throat slit.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.984
Yeah, a local warlord
is suspected.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.586
Most likely sold the bullets
to the highest bidder.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.890
And they somehow ended up
on the streets of New Orleans.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.325
Yeah, I'll contact Bagram,
see if the agent

13:12.359 --> 13:14.394
in charge of the investigation

13:14.427 --> 13:17.064
knows how the bullets were
smuggled out of Afghanistan.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.934
911 from Messier.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.109
Looks like your friend
Baitfish hit again.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.078
Victim's name
is Delvin Powell.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.046
Up until an hour ago,

13:33.080 --> 13:35.015
he was a driver
for Z&R trucking.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.184
Suspects cut in front
of the driver,

13:37.217 --> 13:39.419
opened fire with an
automatic weapon.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.421
Bullets turned
his insides to mush.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.925
Well, not a technical term,
but the description's apropos.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.227
Blended-metal bullets.
That's what it looks like.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.429
Driver didn't go down
without a fight though.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.465
That's a lot of gun for a truck
driver. What was he hauling?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.101
Furniture.

13:54.134 --> 13:58.038
Baitfish should be making
a beeline to Mexico.

13:58.071 --> 14:01.441
Instead, he tries to hijack
a furniture truck?

14:01.474 --> 14:04.644
And I'm thinking right now
he's sorry he did.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.079
Someone got shot.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.050
What is it?

14:10.083 --> 14:11.651
Sonja.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.921
It's been over two hours,
she hasn't checked in.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.356
You think she made contact with
Baitfish, got caught up in this?

14:16.389 --> 14:19.092
She texted me.
They were supposed to meet.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.061
Bring up her GPS.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.997
We need to find her location
right now.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.133
No signal.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.367
I'll try again.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.402
Don't bother.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.048
Sonja's phone.

14:54.962 --> 14:57.364
We've determined
blended metal bullets

14:57.397 --> 15:01.301
killed our latest victim,
same as the two police officers.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.237
And I've confirmed
two distinct blood types

15:04.271 --> 15:08.308
at the crime scene: the driver,
Delvin Powell, and someone else.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.378
I haven't identified blood
as yet, but I can tell you...

15:11.411 --> 15:12.645
It wasn't Baitfish.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.982
I ran DNA, no hits yet.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.217
Were you able to indicate gender
from the blood sample?

15:17.250 --> 15:19.987
Yes.
Blood belongs to a woman,

15:20.020 --> 15:21.721
but I'm guessing
you already knew that.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.256
What am I missing here?

15:25.325 --> 15:27.727
This woman
isn't on Baitfish's crew.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.964
Her name's Sonja Percy.
She's ATF, undercover.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.232
Seriously

15:32.265 --> 15:33.500
She's hurt.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.968
She's gonna need
medical attention.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.403
That's why I brought you
the phone.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.271
I was wondering
if you could retrace her steps,

15:38.305 --> 15:40.340
figure out where she was
before the truck hijacking.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.742
Well, if we had the phone's SIM
card I could track the GPS,

15:42.775 --> 15:45.278
but it's missing.
What do you mean it's missing?

15:45.312 --> 15:48.681
Someone either took it out or it
got lost during the shoot-out.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.283
Either way,
there's nothing to track.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.425
Anything?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.693
Nothing yet.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.695
Hey, you look exhausted.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.032
Let me tap in,
give you a break.

16:05.065 --> 16:09.269
Appreciate it, Messier,
but I need something to do.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.707
Idle mind fills
with uneasy thoughts, huh?

16:14.741 --> 16:16.743
Yeah.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.046
Different for you now.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.747
Lost someone close.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.350
You want to think
you're the same person,

16:23.383 --> 16:25.452
but truth is...

16:25.485 --> 16:28.588
never gonna be.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.358
You speaking from experience?

16:31.391 --> 16:32.759
Had a partner.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.028
Theo Garland.

16:35.062 --> 16:38.265
His wife was killed--
robbery gone wrong.

16:38.298 --> 16:41.068
Addict with
an itchy trigger finger.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.303
Theo was homicide 20 years.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.473
Thought he could
handle the pain.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.342
Went down a dark hole,
never came back.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.578
Not even after
he found the killer.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.747
Theo

16:54.781 --> 16:58.085
Was no arrest.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.820
Theo wasn't looking for justice.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.422
He wanted satisfaction.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.360
Wait a second.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.530
What have we here?

17:12.432 --> 17:14.401
Artifacts--
hundreds of years old

17:14.434 --> 17:16.469
and stolen from Iraq
after the fall of Saddam.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.171
War treasure?
I looked them up.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.407
These beauties are called
the Tear Drops of Assyria.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.243
Been dealt back and forth
on the black market for years.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.412
That's why Baitfish was wanting
to hijack the truck.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.680
One last score
before getting out of Dodge.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.850
And are you ready for this?
Rap sheet on our dead

17:30.883 --> 17:33.653
truck driver, Delvin Powell--
served five years in Angola

17:33.686 --> 17:35.355
for drug
and weapons charges.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.590
Former member of
the Broussard syndicate, right?

17:37.624 --> 17:39.326
Yes.
And that's not all.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.361
The company that the
truck belongs to--

17:41.394 --> 17:44.731
Z&R hauling, owned and operated
by the Latendale Group.

17:44.764 --> 17:45.832
Sasha Broussard.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.134
Jenks was partners with her.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.168
They split ways,

17:48.201 --> 17:50.437
and now he hijacks
her truck.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.472
King, take a look.

17:59.812 --> 18:03.616
Three families
are grieving today,

18:03.650 --> 18:06.519
and the killer is on the loose.

18:06.553 --> 18:10.490
Which is why my foundation
is offering a $100,000 reward

18:10.523 --> 18:12.825
for information leading to

18:12.859 --> 18:16.896
the capture and arrest
of Paul Jenks.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.333
We've set up a Web site
and a hotline, and are...

18:22.635 --> 18:24.471
That's some move.

18:24.504 --> 18:27.507
If she gets access to all the
tips coming into the hotline--

18:27.540 --> 18:31.278
chance to grab Baitfish
before us.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.446
I'll deal with Sasha.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.814
You two,

18:34.847 --> 18:37.617
find Sonja.

18:37.650 --> 18:38.851
Find her now.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.858
Damn it, no one's answering
the frickin' phone!

18:45.892 --> 18:47.927
They all running scared.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.896
What you need? Maybe I can help.

18:49.929 --> 18:53.866
Only thing help me now
is Cousin Marie.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.702
Got to get to her fast.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.136
I'll drive you.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.208
Every cop in the city's
already looking for me.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.743
I don't need you bleeding
to death all over me, too.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.619
Well, it was your idea
to rob the truck

19:12.652 --> 19:14.554
and go all Rambo on the driver.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.722
He wouldn't
get out of the cab.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.590
Well, what was
in the truck?

19:17.624 --> 19:19.892
Supposed to be my swan song.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.928
One last score.

19:24.531 --> 19:27.234
If I could only
get to Chalmette.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.468
And your Cousin Marie?

19:28.501 --> 19:31.304
Insurance policy.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.340
Doesn't matter.
Not gonna happen.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.941
Got a target
on my back.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.490
Listen, darlin'...

19:50.523 --> 19:52.659
I appreciate
everything you done.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.228
So...

19:55.262 --> 19:58.231
you'll have to
excuse my manners.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.634
I'm gonna need
the keys to your car.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.941
Dwayne.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.777
Oh...

20:10.810 --> 20:12.011
how are you?

20:12.044 --> 20:14.247
Fine, Sasha. You?

20:14.281 --> 20:16.916
I'm just relieved
that you weren't hurt.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.918
If there's anything
I can do.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.321
Well, you've done enough.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.955
$100,000?

20:22.989 --> 20:24.023
Oh, right.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.825
You saw the
press conference.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.394
I wanted to help.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.496
Well, you know we appreciate it.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.897
Oh.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.231
Coffee?

20:34.434 --> 20:36.869
So, what is wrong

20:36.903 --> 20:37.970
with Jenks?

20:38.004 --> 20:39.839
All these shootings--

20:39.872 --> 20:42.275
it's like he's gone crazy.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.476
Not crazy.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.044
Desperate maybe.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.414
But he's got a plan.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.283
He never struck me
as the planning type.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.385
What's he up to?

20:52.419 --> 20:54.321
Well, best we can tell,

20:54.354 --> 20:56.856
Jenks is looking to rob
his former business partner.

20:57.990 --> 21:01.328
One last score
before skipping town.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.430
So what is it?

21:03.463 --> 21:05.465
What's he trying to steal?

21:05.498 --> 21:09.402
Iraqi war treasure, for one.

21:09.436 --> 21:12.372
Now I know you must be kidding.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.376
His partner runs
in exotic circles.

21:18.378 --> 21:21.314
Any idea who this partner is?

21:21.348 --> 21:24.317
Some.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.955
We both want
the same thing, Dwayne.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.359
For Jenks to be stopped.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.395
Stopped

21:36.028 --> 21:37.997
Whatever works.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.370
Excuse me.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.375
Got to go.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.778
Thanks for the chat.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.597
Sonja's SIM card went
back online 30 minutes ago.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.899
She must have slipped
it into a new phone.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.601
Where is she?
We're not quite sure.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.469
Last time it came on
was in the CBD.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.605
We tried calling,
but no answer.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.139
Then it went back off-line
again; it's been like that.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.575
Every few minutes,
online, off, no answer.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.811
It's back.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.813
LASALLE:
That's right outside the door.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.789
Paul Jenks!

22:36.823 --> 22:38.658
Get your hands in the air!

22:38.691 --> 22:40.126
Now!

22:40.159 --> 22:42.495
I'm not here to fight.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.096
I'm here to surrender.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.751
Like some of that coffee.

23:06.453 --> 23:09.088
Maybe the lady agent
can bring me a cup.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.891
PRIDE:
Coffee can wait.

23:11.924 --> 23:15.094
Your crew.

23:15.127 --> 23:16.963
I need locations.

23:16.996 --> 23:19.566
I'm not enough for you?

23:19.599 --> 23:21.100
Now.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.002
I need addresses.

23:24.036 --> 23:24.804
Dead.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.839
Missing.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.508
Arrested.

23:30.877 --> 23:31.878
Dead.

23:35.515 --> 23:36.949
Well, dying, actually.

23:36.983 --> 23:39.652
She was still breathing
last time I saw her.

23:39.686 --> 23:41.854
Where was that?

23:41.888 --> 23:45.592
I'll tell you...
if you give me a cup of coffee.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.894
Black, two sugars.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.830
This isn't a game.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.865
You got no leverage here.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.934
Okay, if you say so.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.204
Pumping station

23:58.237 --> 24:00.507
about two miles south
of the truck we tried to take.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.942
Leads to the levee. She's there.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.879
Lasalle?

24:06.913 --> 24:09.882
Let's go.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.789
Not sure why you care so much
about the girl.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.057
It's me you want.

24:21.193 --> 24:24.163
Wipe the smile off your face.

24:24.196 --> 24:27.099
You got a lot to answer for,
Baitfish.

24:27.133 --> 24:31.070
Well, I told you,
I'm not your Baitfish anymore.

24:31.103 --> 24:33.906
You see that now, right, Dwayne?

24:33.940 --> 24:36.175
I deserve respect.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.177
I have a name.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.912
Why don't you say it?

24:39.946 --> 24:42.782
That why you went after
my people?

24:42.815 --> 24:43.950
Respect?

24:43.983 --> 24:45.618
Had to show you, Dwayne.

24:45.652 --> 24:48.020
Mess with the bull...
get the horns.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.188
And yet,

24:49.221 --> 24:52.024
here you are
in my interrogation room.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.527
By choice.
You're not my only enemy.

24:54.561 --> 24:57.630
Your partner Sasha
is looking to take you out.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.567
My ex-partner. She turned on me.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.035
'Cause you tried to kill her.

25:03.069 --> 25:05.538
Then you started robbing
from her.

25:05.572 --> 25:08.207
Bitch used me,
so I used her back.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.110
You're small-time, Baitfish.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.980
Always have been,
always will be.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.916
I'm gonna give 'em Sasha,
hook, line and sinker.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.959
You have my attention.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.327
Start talking.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.663
Sorry.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.833
Not until my lawyer gets here.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.735
Karen Izzo.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.606
Izzo?

25:39.639 --> 25:40.673
Hmm.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.742
From the U.S. Attorney?

25:42.775 --> 25:44.944
She's on her way right now.

25:44.977 --> 25:48.114
Called her...
right from your doorstep.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.717
We already made a deal.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.988
Now...

25:56.022 --> 25:58.024
about that coffee?

26:01.861 --> 26:04.096
Sonja!

26:08.167 --> 26:10.737
Sonja Percy?!

26:11.971 --> 26:14.106
SONJA:
Over here.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.142
Lasalle.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.810
Down there.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.988
I'll call an ambulance.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.356
You're okay.

26:30.389 --> 26:32.659
Never better.

26:32.692 --> 26:35.962
Put your SIM card
in Jenks's phone

26:35.995 --> 26:38.064
so you could warn us
of his location.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.632
You're welcome.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.634
He surrendered.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.770
Surrendered?

26:43.803 --> 26:46.773
Last I heard, he was
on his way to Chalmette.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.040
What's in Chalmette?

26:48.074 --> 26:50.242
Cousin Marie supposedly.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.812
Ambulance is
on the way.

26:54.013 --> 26:56.749
The job's over, Percy.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.118
All right, it's time
for you to come in.

26:59.151 --> 27:02.054
Lasalle...

27:02.088 --> 27:05.257
I'm sorry about the mermaid.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.395
Paul Jenks has offered

27:09.428 --> 27:11.230
his testimony
in exchange for a deal.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.966
He's got at least
ten bodies on him.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.902
Including two
police officers.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.670
What he's offering is too good.

27:17.704 --> 27:19.005
Sasha Broussard.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.272
Says he has a working knowledge

27:20.306 --> 27:22.241
of her entire organization.

27:22.274 --> 27:24.143
Drug-trafficking,
gun-running, extortion.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.412
He doing any time
under this deal?

27:26.445 --> 27:28.915
Five years.

27:28.948 --> 27:31.183
Oh.
And then WITSEC.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.252
He receives relocation,
a new identity?

27:33.285 --> 27:36.088
He's the biggest witness
we've had since Sammy the Bull.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.324
He can link Sasha

27:38.357 --> 27:40.126
to boldface names.

27:40.159 --> 27:43.195
Politicians,
institutional corruption.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.898
Hey, how about...

27:45.932 --> 27:48.200
What if I can
make the same case?

27:48.234 --> 27:52.705
Give you everything Jenks has
to take down the big names.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.306
You can do that?

27:54.340 --> 27:55.708
With time.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.877
One thing I don't have.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.445
HAMILTON: Must be something
we can work out.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.214
It's not
a negotiation, Doug.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.050
No. No negotiation, Karen.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.385
No negotiation. It's just
a private conversation.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.487
Two friends.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.723
Or we could discuss it

28:10.757 --> 28:13.760
on the 5:00 news
when I go public

28:13.793 --> 28:17.296
with the families
of two murdered cops and ask why

28:17.329 --> 28:19.832
U.S. Attorney is standing
in the way of due process.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.771
This deal is getting signed
first thing tomorrow morning.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.407
You've got until then.

28:33.379 --> 28:36.115
Yeah.

28:36.148 --> 28:40.887
Well, you said you needed help,
and you just got some.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.189
Y'all can thank me later.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.859
LASALLE:
King.

28:46.893 --> 28:49.261
Sonja's in the
ICU-- stable.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.165
Okay. We need to focus now.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.534
We only got 12 hours
to make the case against Sasha,

28:55.567 --> 28:57.069
without Jenks' cooperation,

28:57.103 --> 28:59.071
or he makes the deal
of a lifetime.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.440
Maybe Cousin Marie
can help.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.075
Who's that?
It's from Sonja.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.177
It's the last person
Jenks wanted to see

29:05.211 --> 29:06.846
before he turned
himself in.

29:06.879 --> 29:08.080
BRODY:
Lasalle.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.882
Someone's here to see you.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.224
PETE:
From Savannah.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.392
I found it in her things.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.194
I-I think she meant
to give it to you.

29:26.432 --> 29:29.501
That's why I came down here.

29:29.535 --> 29:32.204
But now I know this--
that you're letting him off?

29:38.344 --> 29:40.913
What do you want me to do?

29:40.947 --> 29:43.249
Get justice for my little girl.

29:51.057 --> 29:54.193
You think Cousin Marie
connects Baitfish to Sasha.

29:54.226 --> 29:56.963
Hoping it does.

29:58.965 --> 30:02.134
But in the 20 years
I've known Baitfish,

30:02.168 --> 30:06.072
I've never once
heard of anyone...

30:06.105 --> 30:07.606
named Marie.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.276
Maybe an

30:10.309 --> 30:12.411
No, no. No associates.

30:12.444 --> 30:15.381
Broussards.

30:15.414 --> 30:19.251
Jenks worked for them,
one way or another, for years.

30:19.285 --> 30:23.155
Everything he's got,
they either gave him

30:23.189 --> 30:24.924
or he stole from them.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.358
We've looked
into every Broussard.

30:26.392 --> 30:29.228
There's no Marie.

30:29.261 --> 30:33.132
Hang on.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.600
There is a Marie, Brody.

30:34.633 --> 30:38.237
Married name was Thibodeaux.

30:38.270 --> 30:41.207
She died... 1967.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.343
But if she's dead...

30:44.376 --> 30:47.413
Every family has their own way
of honoring their loved ones.

30:47.446 --> 30:50.349
Some do it by naming babies.

30:50.382 --> 30:54.420
The Broussards honor their dead

30:54.453 --> 30:56.322
by naming boats.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.390
First time I arrested

30:58.424 --> 31:04.030
Baitfish, he was hiding out
in a shrimp trawler.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.032
Cousin Marie.

31:06.065 --> 31:09.235
BRODY: Harbor Master says boat's
been unattended for months.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.389
I'll check the back.
Right.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.274
Hey, Brody!

31:48.307 --> 31:50.176
Come take a look at this!

31:51.978 --> 31:53.512
BRODY:
Blended metal rounds.

31:53.545 --> 31:56.248
Yeah, thousands of them.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.488
That's not all.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.593
Special bullets
from Afghanistan,

32:07.626 --> 32:10.596
war treasures from Iraq,
and all this money from...

32:10.629 --> 32:12.464
Wherever the hell.

32:15.701 --> 32:18.570
Got to be at least 30 million
on that boat.

32:20.172 --> 32:23.075
Yeah, well, the question is:
how is it all connected?

32:23.109 --> 32:25.177
I'm gonna take these
bills to Sebastian,

32:25.211 --> 32:26.478
see what he can
scare up.

32:26.512 --> 32:28.480
All right.

32:31.017 --> 32:33.219
The bills are counterfeit,
known as supernotes.

32:33.252 --> 32:34.653
Nearly flawless.

32:34.686 --> 32:37.489
Same color-shifting ink
as genuine American currency,

32:37.523 --> 32:39.658
but images are finer than
any notes produced in the US.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.393
They weren't made here?

32:41.427 --> 32:43.262
Sadly, no. There was a time

32:43.295 --> 32:44.730
when we manufactured
the greatest goods in the world.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.465
Now we can't even make
our own fake money?

32:46.498 --> 32:49.335
Thanks.

32:49.368 --> 32:52.338
All of this contraband
was smuggled into the country

32:52.371 --> 32:54.173
and then stolen by Jenks.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.742
Whoever smuggled it in
needed access to the port.

32:56.775 --> 32:59.111
We know who
smuggled it: Sasha.

32:59.145 --> 33:03.182
Not just access, infrastructure.
A system to move the contraband.

33:03.215 --> 33:06.185
Ships, trucks, bribes.

33:06.218 --> 33:07.719
Look, Sasha Broussard
owns the trucking company

33:07.753 --> 33:09.355
that Baitfish robbed.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.456
We know, Chris.
We can tie her

33:10.489 --> 33:12.524
to the truck
and the war treasure.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.426
But there's more.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.662
Sasha has a position
in a logistics firm

33:16.695 --> 33:19.165
that handles the loading
and unloading of ships,

33:19.198 --> 33:21.567
not just in New
Orleans but worldwide.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.503
And her firm
subcontracts with the Navy.

33:24.536 --> 33:27.306
Sasha's using Navy containers?

33:27.339 --> 33:28.474
Then this isn't about

33:28.507 --> 33:30.742
a single illicit transaction.

33:30.776 --> 33:33.479
It's... about hundreds of 'em,

33:33.512 --> 33:36.448
thousands,
coming through our port.

33:36.482 --> 33:40.552
Open the spigot and let it all
come pouring into the country.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.122
That's what Baitfish
is offering the U.S. Attorney.

33:43.155 --> 33:44.623
And that's what
we can't prove yet.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.825
Time's up.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.794
What the hell are we doing here?

33:51.563 --> 33:54.600
SASHA: ...continues to raise
awareness around this city.

33:54.633 --> 33:57.469
And in this last quarter,
we raised $10 million,

33:57.503 --> 33:58.570
so congratulations...

33:58.604 --> 34:00.506
Step away from
the table.

34:00.539 --> 34:03.375
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

34:03.409 --> 34:07.279
In five minutes,
Paul Jenks is gonna sign a deal.

34:07.313 --> 34:10.782
If you'll excuse me
for just a minute.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.624
Are you here
to thank me?

34:18.657 --> 34:19.691
Here to arrest you.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.694
Or you can turn yourself in.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.531
I know, Sasha.

34:25.564 --> 34:29.101
About the port, the trucks,
the shipping company.

34:29.135 --> 34:30.869
I'm a businesswoman.
Yeah.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.605
Your business
is using Navy resources

34:33.639 --> 34:36.142
to make the port
into a Hellmouth.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.677
I don't even know
what that means.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.679
But Paul Jenks does.

34:40.712 --> 34:44.250
And he's laying it all out
to the U.S. Attorney.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.418
Your whole operation.

34:46.452 --> 34:49.788
In return, he walks.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.523
He'll bury you.

34:51.557 --> 34:53.659
Turn yourself in.

34:53.692 --> 34:57.596
If you plead guilty,
Jenks's deal is dead.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.531
He'll get life.

34:59.565 --> 35:01.500
He'll take the heat
for all the murders,

35:01.533 --> 35:03.569
and I'll work
with the U.S. Attorney

35:03.602 --> 35:05.637
to get you
a reasonable sentence.

35:11.243 --> 35:13.245
Dwayne...

35:14.380 --> 35:16.182
...I really have no idea

35:16.215 --> 35:17.683
what you're talking about.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.229
You are making a mistake.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.833
We already have Baitfish, Sasha.

35:34.866 --> 35:38.437
We got him, we got you.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.806
Do you?

35:42.774 --> 35:45.511
Time's up, Special Agents.

35:45.544 --> 35:48.680
Jenks is in my custody now.
I'm sorry.

35:48.714 --> 35:51.517
Meet you back
at the Federal Building.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.818
We're coming
with you.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.686
It's not gonna change my answer.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.355
Won't stop us from trying.

35:56.388 --> 35:57.889
Let's go.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.294
King, you there?

36:02.328 --> 36:03.729
Sasha didn't take the deal.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.297
Not gonna let
this happen.

36:05.331 --> 36:07.233
I'm not letting Baitfish
get away with this.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.935
We're fighting this, Chris,
I promise.

36:12.638 --> 36:13.705
Get down!

36:15.707 --> 36:17.709
Chris.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.645
Brody.

36:19.678 --> 36:20.912
You there?

36:41.367 --> 36:44.403
999. Shots fired
on the corner of St. Joseph

36:44.436 --> 36:45.671
and Market Street.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.506
All four gunmen down.

36:47.539 --> 36:48.874
Marshals okay?
I think so.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.342
But Jenks is
in the wind.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.878
Lasalle!

36:52.911 --> 36:53.945
Damn it.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.783
Brody.
BRODY :
Four gunmen down.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.285
Baitfish is loose.
He's in the warehouse.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.719
Lasalle gave chase.

37:13.799 --> 37:14.933
Lasalle's in here.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.535
NOPD's sending backup.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.903
Messier's got
the wounded marshals.

37:31.983 --> 37:33.852
They were trying to kill me.
You see that?

37:38.924 --> 37:40.392
I'll come in peacefully.

38:01.580 --> 38:02.981
Pick it up.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.583
What?

38:04.616 --> 38:05.984
Your weapon.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.052
Pick it up.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.756
I'm not resisting, friend.

38:10.789 --> 38:11.723
I'm not your friend.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.392
What, you gonna shoot me?

38:13.425 --> 38:14.993
An unarmed man?

38:15.026 --> 38:18.397
I'm giving you a chance
to defend yourself,

38:18.430 --> 38:20.332
which is more than
what you gave her.

38:20.366 --> 38:22.901
Your girlfriend, right?

38:26.638 --> 38:27.973
Wasn't personal, you know.

38:28.006 --> 38:32.444
Pick... up... your gun.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.717
Now! Pick it up!

38:40.986 --> 38:41.953
PRIDE:
Christopher.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.591
What are you doing?

38:45.624 --> 38:47.926
What needs to be done, King.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.961
I know how you feel.

38:51.830 --> 38:52.998
I've wanted this bastard
for 20 years.

38:53.031 --> 38:54.966
He doesn't deserve a new start.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.368
You're right.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.670
He doesn't.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.872
And Savannah didn't
deserve to die.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.107
But here we are.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.009
He's gonna pay.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.677
Right here.

39:05.711 --> 39:06.945
Right now.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.880
Okay. Shoot him.

39:08.914 --> 39:10.482
And then what?

39:12.050 --> 39:13.585
Pain isn't going away.

39:15.654 --> 39:17.456
And you'll be left
with something else,

39:17.489 --> 39:19.491
something way worse inside you.

39:21.560 --> 39:25.397
Savannah deserves justice,
not vengeance.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.151
Made the right choice.

39:46.184 --> 39:48.119
Could easily
reconsider.

39:48.153 --> 39:51.757
Sasha-- she's
out of control.

39:51.790 --> 39:54.059
That's why I had to split ways.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.127
We know she's been flooding
the ports with contraband.

39:56.161 --> 39:59.064
You think that's
what this is about?

40:00.031 --> 40:01.967
Contraband?

40:03.535 --> 40:06.438
That don't even
scratch the surface.

40:06.472 --> 40:10.776
There's a storm coming,
likes of which you never seen.

40:10.809 --> 40:13.745
Gonna hit you Navy folks
where you live.

40:13.779 --> 40:15.614
What are you talking about?

40:16.548 --> 40:17.616
Tell me.

40:17.649 --> 40:20.185
All right, hoss.

40:20.218 --> 40:22.554
Just as soon as I sign
them agreement papers.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.594
BRODY:
Over there!

40:28.627 --> 40:29.928
Shooter's heading out.

40:29.961 --> 40:31.062
Cut him off!

41:12.671 --> 41:13.872
Well...

41:13.905 --> 41:18.143
to what do I owe
the pleasure, Dwayne?

41:18.176 --> 41:20.646
Paul Jenks.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.648
Was murdered two days ago.

41:22.681 --> 41:25.016
Don't look at me.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.152
I was here.

41:27.185 --> 41:30.188
Before he was killed,

41:30.221 --> 41:34.225
he said something
about a storm coming in,

41:34.259 --> 41:37.095
bigger than anything
this city's seen before.

41:37.128 --> 41:39.197
Even if I was

41:39.230 --> 41:41.132
whatever it is

41:41.166 --> 41:45.203
you think I am,
I wouldn't know specifics.

41:45.236 --> 41:47.739
Sasha, come on.

41:47.773 --> 41:50.642
Gonna miss our conversations.

41:50.676 --> 41:53.779
I really have
always liked you,

41:53.812 --> 41:56.682
but at this point in time,

41:56.715 --> 41:59.184
you'll have to speak
to my attorney.

42:00.318 --> 42:02.754
We're done in here.

42:04.355 --> 42:07.693
If something bad's about
to happen to my city...

42:08.960 --> 42:10.128
...you need to tell me.

42:10.161 --> 42:13.599
This is New Orleans, Dwayne.

42:13.632 --> 42:16.201
Something bad's
always happening.

42:26.177 --> 42:28.780
BRODY: You sure you're okay
to do this?

42:28.814 --> 42:31.216
That which does
not kill me.

42:32.884 --> 42:35.320
Plus, with Lasalle at
the mermaid's funeral,

42:35.353 --> 42:36.888
you could use
a wingman.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.790
PETTY OFFICER:
Good morning.

42:38.824 --> 42:43.228
So, you want to see everything
that's come in in the last week.

42:43.261 --> 42:44.329
Yes, we do.

42:44.362 --> 42:47.165
65 acres here.

42:47.198 --> 42:51.102
Another 35 across the river.

42:51.136 --> 42:53.839
Well, where do you want
to start?
