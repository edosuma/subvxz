00:02.000 --> 00:04.230
All right, how about this?
You're abducted by aliens.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.311
- Fine.
- Haul you aboard the mothership...

00:06.480 --> 00:08.755
...take you back to their planet
as a curiosity.

00:08.920 --> 00:12.196
Now, would you rather be
in their zoo or their circus?

00:12.640 --> 00:14.153
I gotta go zoo.

00:14.320 --> 00:16.754
I feel like I could set
more of my own schedule.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.753
In the circus, you get to ride
on the train, see the whole planet.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.559
I'm wearing a little hat.
I'm jumping through fire.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.188
Putting their little alien heads
in my mouth.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.951
- At least it's show business.
- Yeah.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.078
But in the zoo, you know, they might
put a woman in there with me...

00:31.240 --> 00:32.753
...to, you know, get me to mate.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.911
What if she's got no interest in you?

00:35.080 --> 00:36.832
Then I'm pretty much
where I am right now.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.911
Just got to take a ride
on a spaceship.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

00:48.840 --> 00:51.149
George, why couldn't I use
the bathroom in that store?

00:51.320 --> 00:53.788
Kramer, trust me, this is
the best bathroom in Midtown.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.594
He knows.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.318
It's right in there, on the left.

00:57.480 --> 01:01.678
Exquisite marble, high ceilings
and a flush like a jet engine:

01:03.360 --> 01:06.796
Now, listen, you better not wait.
I'll catch you later.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.110
- You sure?
- He knows.

01:16.720 --> 01:17.835
Nice.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.912
Why don't you try
your engagement story?

01:23.960 --> 01:25.712
- Won't work.
- Are you sure?

01:26.840 --> 01:28.671
He knows.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.835
Look, Kevin, I really like you...

01:36.360 --> 01:41.309
...but maybe we'd be better off
just being friends.

01:41.720 --> 01:44.518
- Friends?
- Yeah. I mean...

01:45.320 --> 01:46.992
Oh, God...

01:47.160 --> 01:49.993
...this tuna tastes like an old sponge.

01:50.160 --> 01:54.597
Friends. Yeah. Why not friends?

01:54.760 --> 01:56.671
I might like to try that.

01:56.840 --> 01:58.273
Like you and Jerry.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.316
This damn thing is jammed again.

02:07.480 --> 02:08.913
You know what happens with these?

02:09.080 --> 02:11.753
The rollers,
they get flat spots on them.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.428
Hey, Leland wants everyone
in the conference room now.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.513
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, yeah.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.992
Okay.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.038
I was telling you about Gillian...

02:28.200 --> 02:30.316
...my friend who writes
for the L.L. Bean catalogue.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.436
I really think
you should give her a call.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.636
I don't know, do you have it...?

02:36.840 --> 02:39.798
- Not bad. What does she...?
- I put her stats on the back.

02:41.960 --> 02:45.157
Pretty impressive.
Serious boyfriend, '92 to '95.

02:45.320 --> 02:46.992
- Owns her own car.
- Yup.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.754
Favourite president, James Polk.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.155
Let me see that.

02:51.320 --> 02:55.393
So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you
steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?

02:55.960 --> 02:59.191
You are not gonna believe this. I told
him that I just wanted to be friends.

02:59.360 --> 03:02.636
He's fine with it.
He really wants to be friends.

03:02.800 --> 03:07.316
- Why would anybody want a friend?
- It's really not that bad, actually.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.471
He said he'd go
to the Museum of Miniatures.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.551
This is something
you would never, ever do.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.518
I mean, all that stuff is so small.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.988
Stupid.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.996
You know, if I told my engagement
story to that receptionist...

03:21.160 --> 03:23.913
...but told her this was my fiancée...

03:24.080 --> 03:25.832
- What?
- Don't you see?

03:26.000 --> 03:31.074
Women like that are like members of a
secret tribe living in a forbidden city.

03:31.240 --> 03:34.437
People like me have not been
inside in thousands of years.

03:35.320 --> 03:39.154
But with this, it's like I've already
been with one of her own.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.869
My hand's been stamped.
I come and go as I please.

03:43.480 --> 03:44.993
Well, you've cracked it.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.118
I warned the queen
you were getting close and...

03:48.280 --> 03:51.909
...now it looks like we're gonna have to
move the whole damn forbidden city.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.512
- Can I keep this?
- No, I need it.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.193
Thanks.

04:00.160 --> 04:04.199
Hi. I'm... I'm here to see
a Mr. Art Vandalay.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.920
I'm sorry, sir,
there is no Mr. Vandalay here.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.433
Well, let me...

04:08.600 --> 04:12.752
Let me just check and make sure
I have the right name.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.751
I seem to... Oh, l...

04:15.720 --> 04:18.632
Oh, she's beautiful. Who is she?

04:19.120 --> 04:22.476
Well, if you must know,
she was my fiancée, Susan.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.232
May she rest in peace.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.631
I am so sorry. She was lovely.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.639
- I'm Amanda.
- I'm George.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.995
- Good work today, K-Man.
- You know what they say:

04:34.160 --> 04:36.720
You don't sell the steak,
you sell the sizzle.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.878
- Who's up for drinks? I'm buying.
- In that case, make mine a double.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.399
- Jerry?
- Gillian.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.437
- Hi.
- It's very nice to meet you.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.716
It's nice to meet you.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.800
She had man-hands.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.792
- Man-hands?
- The hands of a man.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.235
It's like a creature
out of Greek mythology.

05:08.400 --> 05:12.439
I mean, she was like part woman,
part horrible beast.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.710
Would you prefer it
if she had no hands at all?

05:16.880 --> 05:18.836
Would she have hooks?

05:20.920 --> 05:24.913
Do... Do hooks make it
more attractive, Jerry?

05:26.040 --> 05:27.234
Kind of cool-looking.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.677
Okay, listen. You're picking me up
from White Plains tomorrow, right?

05:31.840 --> 05:32.829
Yeah. Yeah.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.991
Okay, I got five
huge boxes of buttons.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.038
If you need an extra set of hands,
I know who you can call.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.271
- Kramer?
- Hey, buddy. Hey.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.716
It's 8 in the morning.
What the hell is going on?

05:52.880 --> 05:56.668
Breakfast. I gotta be in
at Brandt-Leland by 9.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.513
Why?

05:59.480 --> 06:01.869
Because I'm working there,
that's why.

06:02.040 --> 06:05.555
How long have I been asleep?
What year is it?

06:05.720 --> 06:07.711
Look, Jerry, I don't know
if you've noticed...

06:07.880 --> 06:10.269
...but lately I've been
drifting aimlessly.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.359
Now that you mention it...

06:12.520 --> 06:15.478
But I finally realized
what's missing in my life.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.312
Structure.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.710
And at Brandt-Leland,
I'm getting things done.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.552
And I love the people
I'm working with.

06:22.160 --> 06:25.197
- How much are they paying you?
- No, no, no. I don't want any pay.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.396
I'm doing this just for me.

06:27.560 --> 06:28.754
Clearly.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.956
So, what do you do
down there all day?

06:31.120 --> 06:32.473
TCB.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.153
You know, taking care of business.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.068
I gotta go. All right, then.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.276
I'll see you tonight.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.271
Forget my briefcase.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.874
- Well, what do you got in there?
- Crackers.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.676
So the picture worked. Amazing!

07:18.840 --> 07:21.149
Hey, she wants me
to dress smart casual.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.594
What...? What is that?

07:22.760 --> 07:24.990
- I don't know, but you don't have it.
- Right. Bye.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.870
- Where were you today?
- What?

07:34.040 --> 07:35.314
Pick up.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.590
- Damn.
- So? Where were you?

07:39.760 --> 07:43.309
Here, I guess.
And I went out and picked up a paper.

07:43.480 --> 07:48.349
I had to ask Kevin to leave his office
and come and pick me up.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.317
- Well, what are friends for?
- Yes.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.879
And he is a friend, Jerry.

07:52.040 --> 07:57.558
He's reliable, he's considerate,
he's like your exact opposite.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.950
So he's Bizarro Jerry.

08:00.640 --> 08:01.789
Bizarro Jerry?

08:01.960 --> 08:03.313
Yeah, like Bizarro Superman.

08:03.480 --> 08:06.438
Superman's exact opposite...

08:06.600 --> 08:08.875
...who lives in the backwards
Bizarro World.

08:09.680 --> 08:10.954
Up is down, down is up.

08:11.120 --> 08:14.271
He says hello when he leaves,
goodbye when he arrives.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.309
Shouldn't he say "badbye"?

08:17.480 --> 08:19.550
Isn't that the opposite of goodbye?

08:20.280 --> 08:21.793
No, it's still goodbye.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.872
- Does he live underwater?
- No.

08:25.040 --> 08:28.669
- Is he black?
- Just forget the whole thing, all right?

08:31.400 --> 08:33.072
Wow, man.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.470
What a day.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.153
- Could I use a drink!
- Tough day at the office?

08:39.320 --> 08:43.711
People kept coming in,
and that phone just wouldn't stop.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.718
We better get going if we're gonna
go to that 7:00 Hall of Fusion.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.235
Yeah, well, count me out.
I'm swimming in it.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.188
Old man Leland is busting
my hump over these reports.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.271
If I don't get them done
by 9, I'm toast.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.470
All right, I have to go.

09:04.640 --> 09:09.555
Oh, and listen, could you
keep it down to a low roar?

09:09.720 --> 09:13.315
Some of us have to work
in the morning. Thanks.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.150
This is a fantastic place.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.795
I always thought
it was a meat-packing plant.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.473
Hey, Amanda.

09:21.840 --> 09:26.152
These are my friends,
Annabell, Justina and Mickey.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.709
- We used to model together.
- Oh, modelling.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.359
What's that like, fun?

09:31.560 --> 09:33.949
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.350
So, Mickey,
how was Paris this time?

09:36.520 --> 09:37.714
A bore.

09:37.880 --> 09:43.000
You know who used to love Paris?
My dead fiancée, Susan.

09:43.160 --> 09:47.597
In fact, I think I may have
a picture of her.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.512
She was beautiful.

09:53.240 --> 09:54.434
Do you wanna dance?

09:59.800 --> 10:04.191
- Would you like some bread, Jerry?
- No. No, thanks, I'm just not hungry.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.828
Well, then, at least drink your beer.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.194
It's not a twist-off.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.752
You have a little something
on your face.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.673
I can get it.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.229
No, no, no.
You're missing it. It's higher.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.351
It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.272
- I don't want to.
- Make a wish.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.032
Okay.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.032
Didn't come true.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.317
Don't you just love lobster?

10:43.320 --> 10:45.515
That Museum of Miniatures
was amazing.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.432
- I know, it was so tiny.
- Yeah.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.716
Hey, guys. Elaine, sit down.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.075
These are a couple of my friends.
This is Gene...

10:52.560 --> 10:55.552
...and this guy we just call Feldman.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.354
Bizarro World.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.392
Jerry, it was incredible.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.279
Models as far as the eye could see.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.830
- Then it does exist.
- Yes, the legends are true.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.592
When are you
going out with her again?

11:15.760 --> 11:16.909
I'm not.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.957
I'm inside the walls.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.398
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

11:22.160 --> 11:25.152
- Flame on!
- So when are we going?

11:25.720 --> 11:29.793
Well, it's a pretty fast-paced crowd.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.430
What would you wear? That?

11:32.600 --> 11:36.434
You know, I'm the one who's actually
dating the woman in the picture.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.749
Yeah.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.115
But I was engaged to her.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.958
- I got it.
- You got it last time.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.792
Don't worry about it.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.110
This is unbelievable.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.397
Say, Elaine, what do you think
of an alarm clock...

11:51.560 --> 11:54.154
...that automatically tells you
the weather when you wake up?

11:54.880 --> 11:59.749
Well, I gotta say, I think that
that is a fantastic idea, Feldman.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.068
I don't know. It's not practical.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.912
Well, see you later, Elaine.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.116
Feldman and I gotta get down
to the library.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.272
- What are you gonna do down there?
- Read.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.271
Hello.

12:21.080 --> 12:25.119
So Gillian's coming over later.
I'm gonna end it.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.232
Those meaty paws. I feel like I'm
dating George "The Animal" Steele.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.833
Yeah.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.591
Maybe I'll chain her
to the refrigerator and sell tickets.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.794
That's nice.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.679
Kramer, put the paper down.
You never listen to me anymore.

12:41.840 --> 12:45.037
- We hardly even talk.
- Well, we're talking now, aren't we?

12:45.200 --> 12:47.555
- I see you 20 minutes in the morning...
- Oh, here we go.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.631
...and when you come home
you're exhausted.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.598
- We never do anything anymore.
- What are you starting with me for?

12:52.760 --> 12:54.990
You know this
is my crazy time of year.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.188
It's your third day.

13:02.080 --> 13:05.072
I gotta go to work.
We'll talk about this later.

13:05.560 --> 13:06.754
Well...

13:06.920 --> 13:09.388
...call if you're gonna be late.

13:11.920 --> 13:16.596
- What is going on with you two?
- Oh, I don't wanna talk about it.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.191
All right, listen.
Have you seen my addre...?

13:20.360 --> 13:23.158
There it is. Okay. I got it.
I'll see you later.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.596
Hey, wait a second. Where you going?
I hardly ever see you anymore.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.797
Well, l...

13:29.600 --> 13:31.158
I guess I've been at Reggies.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.038
The Bizarro coffee shop?

13:33.200 --> 13:35.475
Kevin and his friends
are nice people.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.232
They do good things.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.630
- They read.
- I read.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.472
Books, Jerry.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.952
Big deal.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.075
I can't spend the rest of my life...

13:52.240 --> 13:55.755
...coming into this stinking apartment
every 10 minutes...

13:55.920 --> 14:00.357
...to pore over
the excruciating minutiae...

14:00.520 --> 14:04.593
...of every single daily event.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.752
Why not? Like, yesterday, I went
to the bank to make a deposit...

14:07.920 --> 14:11.595
...and the teller gives me this look...
- I'll see you later, man. I gotta go.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.198
The whole system is breaking down.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.959
Hey. Amanda, hi, yeah.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.476
Listen, you know, I'm thinking we
might just be better off being friends.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.757
Yeah. Yeah. You know what?
I can't really talk about it right now.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.672
Bye-bye.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.749
No. No!

14:44.920 --> 14:48.196
- Friends? Just friends.
- Yeah.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.872
All right. Well, do you still
wanna see a movie later?

14:52.280 --> 14:54.794
I wish I could, but we're friends.

14:56.440 --> 14:59.637
- I'm just gonna go wash my hands.
- Good idea.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.954
There's a beach towel on the rack.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.474
- Yeah.
- Jerry!

15:06.640 --> 15:08.198
My hair dryer ruined the picture.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.794
I need one or I can't
get back into the forbidden city.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.074
Who is this?

15:13.240 --> 15:15.959
Jerry! I need you to get
another picture of man-hands.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.872
I'm begging you.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.312
If I get it, will you take me to that club
and show me a good time?

15:22.480 --> 15:24.072
Yes, yes, all right. Anything.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.071
Okay.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.314
Got it.

15:43.640 --> 15:44.834
Jerry.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.309
- Hey, Jerry?
- I'm right here.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.431
- You're late.
- Yeah, well, I got held up, you know.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.229
- What happened to your hand?
- Like you care.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.709
- Work piled up, I lost track of the time.
- Sure. Sure.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.314
You and your work.
Elaine's off in the Bizarro World...

16:02.480 --> 16:04.436
...George only calls
when he wants something...

16:04.600 --> 16:06.636
...and I'm left sitting here
like this chicken.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.679
Which, by the way, was for two.

16:10.840 --> 16:13.832
- What? You cooked?
- I ordered in. It's still effort.

16:15.480 --> 16:16.629
- Jeez.
- What's wrong?

16:16.800 --> 16:19.473
- It's my stomach.
- You're probably getting an ulcer.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.471
This job is killing you.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.756
It's killing us.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.229
You know what? You're right.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.799
These reports, they can wait.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.837
Say we go out tonight.
Any place you want.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.753
- The coffee shop?
- You got it.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.399
I'll call George.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.077
Hey, isn't that Elaine?

16:38.240 --> 16:39.719
Maybe she can get another picture.

16:39.880 --> 16:41.074
- Elaine?
- Elaine?

16:41.240 --> 16:43.470
- Elaine?
- Hey, Elaine.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.108
Hi. Over here.

16:56.880 --> 17:00.236
Jerry, George, Kramer...

17:00.400 --> 17:05.520
...this is Kevin, Gene and Feldman.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.750
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.237
This is really weird.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.550
Could you guys excuse us
just for a moment?

17:15.720 --> 17:17.311
- Sure.
- Thanks.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.238
What? What do you guys want?

17:20.400 --> 17:22.470
I've got to have
another picture of Gillian.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.598
I tried to get him one, but man-hands
almost ripped my arm out.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.318
- You could have.
- I could not.

17:37.160 --> 17:41.392
Guys, I gotta go. Take it easy.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.711
Elaine?

17:47.280 --> 17:50.511
- Can I come?
- I'm sorry.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.398
We've already got a George.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.317
What did you wanna see
me about, Mr. Leland?

18:02.480 --> 18:06.678
Kramer, I've been reviewing your work.
Quite frankly, it stinks.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.758
Well, I...

18:09.920 --> 18:12.753
I've been having trouble at home.

18:12.920 --> 18:16.754
I mean, you know, I'll work harder,
nights, weekends, whatever it takes.

18:16.920 --> 18:20.310
No. No.
I don't think that's going to do it.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.755
These reports you handed in...

18:22.920 --> 18:25.992
...it's almost as if you have
no business training at all.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.954
I don't know
what this is supposed to be.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.955
Well, I'm just trying to get ahead.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.359
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way
that we could keep you on.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.428
But I don't even really work here.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.591
That's what makes this so difficult.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.875
Hi, I'm George.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.951
Are you sure
you're supposed to be here?

18:55.120 --> 18:56.269
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.032
I used to come here
with my fiancée...

18:58.200 --> 19:00.430
...back when it was
a meat-packing plant.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.830
Here's her picture.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.958
What'd you do? Cut this out
of a magazine or something?

19:06.120 --> 19:07.951
- What?
- That's me.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.792
It's from a Clinique ad I did.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.228
Look at that.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.239
Let's go. Private party.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.591
It's Laney.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.114
- Hi, Elaine.
- Hi, Kevin.

19:23.520 --> 19:24.999
- Come on in.
- Okay.

19:25.160 --> 19:26.149
Hi, Gene.

19:47.640 --> 19:50.359
- What's up?
- Just reading.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.718
Hey, what are you doing?

20:00.360 --> 20:02.669
- Eating olives.
- Ever hear of asking?

20:05.560 --> 20:07.710
- Who is it?
- Feldman.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.791
- From across the hall.
- Hold on.

20:15.720 --> 20:16.914
- Hey.
- Hey, Kevin.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.878
- Hi.
- Look who I ran into.

20:20.840 --> 20:24.958
- Hello, Kevin.
- Hello, Vargas.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.036
- Wanna catch a game this weekend?
- Great.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.952
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.038
Vargas.

20:33.200 --> 20:36.078
- Well, I got them.
- All right.

20:36.240 --> 20:39.994
Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able
to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi.

20:40.160 --> 20:44.153
- Fourth row, centre.
- Get out!

20:45.760 --> 20:48.069
- What's the matter with you?
- Oh, Kevin.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.834
I'm so sorry.
Is there anything I can do?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.592
Haven't you done enough already?

20:56.080 --> 20:57.832
I'll just...

21:02.400 --> 21:03.549
It's...

21:03.720 --> 21:05.199
It's locked.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.555
So this is it, huh?

21:17.680 --> 21:18.829
But it was here.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.117
It was here, I'm telling you.
It was really here.

21:22.280 --> 21:26.353
There was a bar and a dance floor.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.080
I guess the DJ booth was over there
behind the bone saw?

21:30.600 --> 21:32.989
Let's get out of here, George.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.152
At work, I discovered a pay phone in
the lobby that has free long distance.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.389
Oh, so, what did you do?

21:51.560 --> 21:54.313
I called the phone company
and immediately reported the error.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.277
Nice.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.311
- Who is it?
- Feldman.

21:59.480 --> 22:02.552
- From across the hall.
- Hold on.

22:06.520 --> 22:09.717
- Kevin. Brought you some groceries.
- Again?

22:09.880 --> 22:13.475
- Feldman, you didn't have to do that.
- Hey, what are friends for?

22:13.640 --> 22:15.278
You know,
I may not say this enough...

22:15.440 --> 22:19.638
...but you two are about
the best friends a guy could have.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.512
Me so happy.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.989
Me want to cry.
