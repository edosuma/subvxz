<i>Previously on</i>
<i>Beauty and the Beast...</i>

00:03.527 --> 00:05.162
Let him go.
You can choose

00:05.263 --> 00:07.097
to walk away
and save yourself.

00:07.198 --> 00:08.298
Save us.

00:11.736 --> 00:13.303
<i>I found the skeleton</i>
<i>of a strange creature</i>

00:13.404 --> 00:15.272
<i>in the back</i>
<i>of your father's store.</i>

00:15.373 --> 00:17.374
<i>Why would my father care</i>
<i>about a skeleton?</i>

00:17.475 --> 00:18.441
That's what we were
hired to find out.

00:18.542 --> 00:19.842
By who?

00:19.943 --> 00:21.478
Bullet must have nicked
through a blood vessel.

00:21.579 --> 00:23.179
I'm calling an ambulance.
No.

00:23.281 --> 00:25.315
I can't risk being exposed.

00:25.416 --> 00:26.615
We can come up
with a cover story.

00:26.716 --> 00:27.850
Like... amnesia.

00:27.951 --> 00:30.352
<i>Vincent Keller, war hero.</i>

00:30.453 --> 00:32.554
<i>Nobody has to know our secret.</i>

00:32.656 --> 00:33.990
<i>We can do this, Vincent.</i>

00:34.091 --> 00:35.291
Together.

00:35.392 --> 00:36.793
My name is...

00:36.894 --> 00:38.327
is Vincent Keller.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.467
All right,
let's start talking.

00:45.568 --> 00:47.803
Our next guest has become

00:47.904 --> 00:51.206
the talk of Manhattan
as soon as we got here.

00:51.308 --> 00:54.376
A war hero presumed dead
for over ten years

00:54.477 --> 00:56.144
but turns out to be alive,

00:56.245 --> 00:58.480
and very easy on the eyes.

00:58.581 --> 01:01.316
Please welcome
Captain Vincent Keller!

How's that

01:24.272 --> 01:25.840
for a welcome home,
Vincent?

01:25.941 --> 01:27.842
Pretty wild, pretty wild.
Thank you very much.

01:27.943 --> 01:29.210
All right,
I gotta tell you,

01:29.311 --> 01:30.591
it's a little bit
hard to believe

01:30.646 --> 01:31.946
that a guy who
looks like you

01:32.047 --> 01:34.181
could wander around
the streets of this city

01:34.282 --> 01:35.682
and not get noticed.

01:35.783 --> 01:36.851
Am I right, ladies?

01:40.288 --> 01:43.523
No memories from the last
ten years at all?

01:43.624 --> 01:44.791
I mean,
where were living?

01:44.893 --> 01:46.026
What you doing?

01:46.127 --> 01:48.195
Uh, well, no,
no memories at all.

01:48.296 --> 01:49.796
Apart from a couple
of weeks ago

01:49.897 --> 01:51.297
when I was I.D.'d
at the hospital,

01:51.399 --> 01:53.233
it's all been
pretty much a-a blank.

01:53.334 --> 01:54.735
Apart from a few
flashes here and there.

01:54.836 --> 01:56.570
Well, let me ask this,

01:56.671 --> 01:57.937
'cause everyone wants to know,
especially the ladies--

01:58.038 --> 01:59.873
any girlfriends?

01:59.974 --> 02:01.375
I mean,
you haven't forgotten

02:01.476 --> 02:03.042
what girls are, have you?
No.

02:03.143 --> 02:04.411
No.

02:04.512 --> 02:06.145
Uh... no comment.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.949
See, ladies?

02:10.050 --> 02:11.317
Even when men have amnesia,

02:11.418 --> 02:13.552
they still remember

02:13.653 --> 02:15.088
to keep their
options open, right?

02:15.189 --> 02:16.489
It's true, Sharon.

02:16.590 --> 02:18.724
It's true, it's true.

02:18.825 --> 02:19.959
You still have
your medical degree.

02:20.060 --> 02:21.394
You're young,

02:21.495 --> 02:22.995
you're good-looking...

02:23.096 --> 02:24.376
I imagine opportunities are just

02:24.398 --> 02:26.064
coming at you left and right.

02:26.165 --> 02:28.085
Do you have any idea what
you're going to do now?

02:29.736 --> 02:31.103
Uh, well, that...

02:31.204 --> 02:33.839
that is a-a really
good question, Julie.

02:49.088 --> 02:50.588
Hey, sorry I'm late.

02:50.689 --> 02:52.324
Hey, no, that's okay,
no worries.

02:52.425 --> 02:54.626
How's it going?

02:54.727 --> 02:55.860
Good. You?

02:55.961 --> 02:57.662
Good.
Mm-hmm.

03:00.032 --> 03:01.232
Congratulations,
you caught me.

03:01.266 --> 03:02.834
You happy?

03:02.935 --> 03:04.636
Is this attitude
or caffeine talking?

03:04.737 --> 03:06.203
It's neither.
I'm fine, okay?

03:06.305 --> 03:07.806
I'm just tired
of people walking

03:07.907 --> 03:09.040
on eggshells around me,

03:09.141 --> 03:10.308
like I lost
my best friend.

03:10.409 --> 03:12.276
Well, actually, you did.

03:12.377 --> 03:13.444
You know what I mean.

03:13.545 --> 03:15.046
Besides,
Vincent wasn't

03:15.147 --> 03:16.314
my best friend.

03:16.415 --> 03:18.682
You are.
Aw...

03:20.986 --> 03:22.719
And if you want to maintain
that lofty position in my life,

03:22.821 --> 03:24.555
you have to stop
worrying about me all the time.

03:24.656 --> 03:26.056
Cat, you're the one
reading about it

03:26.124 --> 03:27.358
and trying
to cover it up.

03:27.459 --> 03:28.892
I'm a cop,
I notice these things.

03:30.161 --> 03:31.321
But look,
I believe you, okay?

03:31.329 --> 03:33.196
Like... I think you know

03:33.297 --> 03:35.866
that right now you're better off
without Vincent in your life.

03:35.967 --> 03:38.001
But it's gonna take more
than a couple of weeks

03:38.102 --> 03:40.142
to figure out what your life
looks like without him.

03:40.171 --> 03:42.044
I mean, especially
after a year and a half...

03:42.069 --> 03:42.639
No.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.307
No, don't use the "B" word.

03:44.408 --> 03:46.476
Fine with me.
And you're right,

03:46.577 --> 03:48.644
I've been all "B" all the time
for a while now.

03:48.745 --> 03:50.513
It's gonna take some time

03:50.614 --> 03:52.983
for me to figure out who I am
separate from all that.

03:53.084 --> 03:54.150
Yep.

03:54.251 --> 03:55.651
But it doesn't

03:55.752 --> 03:57.087
make it any easier
when his face is plastered

03:57.188 --> 03:58.754
all over the news.

03:58.856 --> 04:00.890
It's page three, below the fold.

04:02.359 --> 04:03.759
We have to go.
Hmm?

04:03.861 --> 04:05.260
Gabe wants us at
the precinct ASAP.

04:05.362 --> 04:06.362
Come on,
we can figure out

04:06.463 --> 04:07.497
the rest of your
life on the way.

04:07.598 --> 04:09.365

04:09.466 --> 04:15.371

04:17.839 --> 04:19.375
Thanks for being
in our studio audience...

04:19.476 --> 04:21.043
Hey. You did great.

04:21.144 --> 04:22.777
I can't believe I even let you
talk me into this.

04:22.879 --> 04:24.119
Vincent, hey,
what's the matter?

04:24.147 --> 04:25.547
They loved you!
Who?

04:25.648 --> 04:27.568
Who did they love, okay?
Because I'm no war hero.

04:27.617 --> 04:28.617
I escaped, remember?

04:28.718 --> 04:29.998
The Army, they tried to kill me.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.186
Shh, keep your voice down.

04:31.287 --> 04:32.354
Keep my voice down? Why?

04:32.455 --> 04:33.455
So I can hide?

04:33.556 --> 04:35.557
Hide from the truth
of what I am, what I've been doing?

04:35.658 --> 04:37.358
Everybody already knows
about the amnesia.

04:37.459 --> 04:38.820
Well, that's not
the truth, either.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.702
Maybe the last three or
four months were, sure,

04:40.796 --> 04:42.463
but what about whole
decade before that?

04:42.565 --> 04:45.867
I don't know, Tori,
this whole public thing...

04:45.968 --> 04:47.602
I thought maybe it would
help stop the lying,

04:47.703 --> 04:49.103
but the truth is
I'm lying about myself

04:49.204 --> 04:50.405
more than
I ever have.

04:57.346 --> 04:59.280
Sorry to call you down here,
but we need to keep this quiet.

04:59.381 --> 05:01.282
What's up?

05:01.383 --> 05:02.650
Special Agent
Dana Landon, FBI.

05:02.751 --> 05:04.919
Detectives Chandler
and Vargas.

05:05.020 --> 05:07.387
Name's Mara Angel--

05:07.488 --> 05:08.589
professional thief,

05:08.690 --> 05:10.257
con artist, wanted for murder.

05:10.358 --> 05:11.491
She was recruited

05:11.593 --> 05:12.927
for a very big heist.

05:13.028 --> 05:14.628
We were staking her out,
but she spotted us.

05:14.729 --> 05:16.329
Who shot her?
I did.

05:16.431 --> 05:18.732
The thing is,
Agent Landon doesn't think

05:18.833 --> 05:20.601
that the rest of the crew
knows that Mara's dead yet.

05:20.702 --> 05:22.836
We need a volunteer
to take her place--

05:22.938 --> 05:25.004
go undercover,
infiltrate the crew,

05:25.106 --> 05:27.107
find out what they're after.
Our intel says

05:27.208 --> 05:28.675
they have not met her
in person yet, so...

05:28.776 --> 05:30.410
So you want me to pretend
to be her 'cause we look alike?

05:30.511 --> 05:32.011
Among other reasons, yes.

05:32.113 --> 05:33.674
And I told her
it's too dangerous.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.182
We don't know enough
about the case

05:35.283 --> 05:36.450
and there's not enough time to prep.
I agree.

05:36.551 --> 05:38.351
When do I have
to decide by?

05:38.453 --> 05:39.252
Now.

05:39.353 --> 05:40.753
Mara's supposed to meet

05:40.854 --> 05:42.188
the the crew tonight.

05:42.289 --> 05:43.522
Tonight?
That's crazy.

05:43.624 --> 05:45.124
Right?

05:45.225 --> 05:46.993
How important is it?

05:47.094 --> 05:49.929
Hugely. We've been
surveilling Mara for months.

05:50.030 --> 05:51.163
I mean, this is...

05:51.264 --> 05:52.665
this is our best
opportunity

05:52.766 --> 05:54.767
to get in at the beginning,
identify the players

05:54.868 --> 05:56.435
and really break up this ring
once and for all.

05:56.536 --> 05:58.536
Catherine, you can't seriously
be considering this.

05:58.572 --> 06:00.306
Yeah, you just got out
of a bad relationship.

06:00.407 --> 06:01.673
You want to get
in a worse one?

06:03.710 --> 06:04.876
You're right. It's crazy.

06:10.484 --> 06:12.884
You know what?
On second thought, I'm in.

Hey, Vincent, me again.

06:39.923 --> 06:41.891
Listen, I'm sure you're busy

06:41.992 --> 06:43.558
getting the key
to the city and all,

06:43.660 --> 06:45.494
but if you have a minute,

06:45.595 --> 06:47.362
please give me a call.

06:47.463 --> 06:48.697
JT?!

06:48.798 --> 06:51.266
Ah, Beast 911.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.367
Finally.

06:52.468 --> 06:53.602
I got your messages, man.

06:53.703 --> 06:54.936
What's going on?
You okay?

06:55.037 --> 06:57.238
Uh, no,
I'm not okay.

06:57.340 --> 06:58.707
Maybe you're used to
getting your ass kicked,

06:58.808 --> 06:59.941
but I'm not; it hurts.

07:00.042 --> 07:01.409
Why didn't you
call the police?

07:01.510 --> 07:03.011
Because it's not
police business.

07:03.112 --> 07:04.512
It's beast business.

07:04.613 --> 07:05.947
Two guys
in ski marks

07:06.048 --> 07:07.548
busted in here with guns.

07:07.649 --> 07:09.217
They wanted
your dad's shackle.

07:09.318 --> 07:11.552
The shackle? It...

07:11.653 --> 07:13.087
Here, get more ice.

07:13.189 --> 07:14.622
Why didn't they
take the skeleton?

07:14.723 --> 07:16.024
I don't know.
I didn't ask.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.225
They said if I
called the cops,

07:18.327 --> 07:19.627
they'd come back
and kill me,

07:19.728 --> 07:20.861
and I believe them.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.930
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

07:23.031 --> 07:25.533
I never should've asked you
to study these things.

07:25.634 --> 07:26.900
No, I-I wanted to.

07:27.001 --> 07:28.536
I just don't get
why they didn't want

07:28.637 --> 07:30.471
the skeleton.
It's way more valuable.

07:30.572 --> 07:33.540
I carbon dated it
back 10,000 years,

07:33.641 --> 07:35.608
to the Pleistocene Age.

07:35.710 --> 07:37.610
Wait, that thing is
10,000 years old?

07:37.712 --> 07:39.213
And it's unlike
any fossil

07:39.314 --> 07:40.613
or species
I've ever seen.

07:40.715 --> 07:41.448
It's not recorded.

07:41.549 --> 07:43.383
It gets better.

07:43.484 --> 07:45.953
Its DNA has some of the same

07:46.054 --> 07:47.821
beast markers you have.

07:47.922 --> 07:49.156
Meaning?

07:49.257 --> 07:50.423
Meaning...

07:50.524 --> 07:51.825
say hello to
your distant cousin.

07:51.925 --> 07:53.727
Or at least
the corrupted

07:53.828 --> 07:56.062
DNA part that
Muirfield gave you.

07:56.163 --> 07:57.930
Wait, I... I don't understand.
I thought you told me

07:58.031 --> 07:59.165
that you were injected?

07:59.266 --> 08:01.568
I was...
but if JT's right,

08:01.669 --> 08:02.902
it wasn't completely
synthetic.

08:03.003 --> 08:04.471
I am right.

08:04.572 --> 08:06.172
Muirfield must've
gotten the serum

08:06.273 --> 08:08.140
using DNA from
an extinct species.

08:08.242 --> 08:10.576
Which means
you're both part

08:10.677 --> 08:12.011
of a beastly lineage

08:12.112 --> 08:14.213
that precedes Muirfield.

08:16.383 --> 08:18.617
Okay, well, that still
doesn't explain

08:18.718 --> 08:19.998
why they only
wanted the shackle.

08:20.087 --> 08:21.287
Or how they even found it here

08:21.388 --> 08:23.455
in the first place.

08:38.605 --> 08:39.537
What are you doing?

08:39.638 --> 08:41.506
Tracking whoever did this.

08:51.817 --> 08:54.386
But if they hadn't
seen each other before,

08:54.486 --> 08:56.721
how was Mara supposed to
identify the rest of the crew?

08:56.822 --> 08:59.624
All we know is they're supposed
to go to FitzMartin's at 9:00.

08:59.725 --> 09:00.925
Mara was instructed
to identify

09:00.992 --> 09:02.827
a man with
a gothic neck tattoo,

09:02.928 --> 09:03.961
and then twirl her ring--

09:04.062 --> 09:05.430
that's the sign.

09:06.565 --> 09:08.332
What was her role?

09:08.434 --> 09:10.554
That, you're gonna have
to find out on your own.

09:10.636 --> 09:12.303
We need to find
out who keeps

09:12.404 --> 09:14.071
hiring these crews,
what they're after,

09:14.172 --> 09:15.172
before anybody
else dies.

09:15.273 --> 09:16.873
They're killers.

09:16.975 --> 09:18.142
Cop killers.

09:18.243 --> 09:19.509
I don't like it.

09:19.610 --> 09:21.090
Catherine, you know
as well as anybody

09:21.146 --> 09:22.586
it takes weeks to
safely put together

09:22.613 --> 09:24.381
an undercover operation,
not hours,

09:24.482 --> 09:25.715
and even then
it is a risk.

09:25.817 --> 09:27.584
We don't have weeks.
This is it.

09:27.685 --> 09:29.125
Well, you'll have
to forgive me

09:29.153 --> 09:30.554
if I'm a little wary,
Agent Landon.

09:30.655 --> 09:32.188
Our recent experiences
with the FBI...

09:32.289 --> 09:34.691
...are less than desirable,
I know. I'm aware.

09:37.528 --> 09:39.062
I know about your father.

09:39.163 --> 09:41.123
That's one of the reasons
I came to you with this.

09:43.768 --> 09:45.401
I don't understand.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.003
Look, I'm FBI.

09:47.104 --> 09:48.938
I love the agency,
I'm fiercely loyal to it.

09:49.039 --> 09:50.739
But that doesn't mean
that I'm blind

09:50.841 --> 09:52.675
to the leaks and corruption
that plague it.

09:52.776 --> 09:53.909
That's why
I'm reaching

09:54.011 --> 09:55.678
outside of the
agency for help.

09:55.779 --> 09:58.614
Somebody who's not afraid
to arrest their own father

09:58.715 --> 10:00.316
is somebody that I can trust.

10:02.151 --> 10:03.352
You don't have to do this.

10:03.453 --> 10:06.088
No, but I want to.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.223
And there's not enough time
to find someone else.

10:08.324 --> 10:09.625
Sorry. Sidebar?

10:09.726 --> 10:11.460
By all means.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.605
Catherine, I just
don't want you

10:16.633 --> 10:17.766
rushing into this
for the wrong reasons.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.134
What wrong reasons?
Come on.

10:19.235 --> 10:20.402
We both know what
you've just gone through

10:20.503 --> 10:21.736
with Vincent, okay?

10:21.837 --> 10:23.038
I just think you should
take things slowly,

10:23.139 --> 10:24.572
find yourself before
impulsively jumping...

10:24.673 --> 10:25.740
I'm not impulsively
jumping into anything.

10:25.841 --> 10:26.774
I'm not.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.044
This <i>is</i> finding myself.

10:29.145 --> 10:30.912
It's what I need to do.
I know that.

10:31.014 --> 10:32.981
And I know that your impulse
is to protect me,

10:33.082 --> 10:34.549
and I appreciate that, I do.

10:34.650 --> 10:37.418
But these are exactly
the kind of assignments

10:37.520 --> 10:39.453
I used to take on
before I met Vincent.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.589
It's why I became a cop
in the first place--

10:41.690 --> 10:42.690
to do things that matter.

10:42.758 --> 10:44.458
I want to get back to that.

10:56.371 --> 10:57.604
Where is he?

10:59.207 --> 11:01.509
I don't know. He <i>was</i> here.

11:01.609 --> 11:02.976
Are you sure?

11:03.078 --> 11:04.478
I mean, you've been
a little confused lately.

11:04.579 --> 11:05.946
Maybe you made a mistake.

11:06.048 --> 11:07.448
I didn't make
a mistake, all right?

11:07.549 --> 11:09.449
I tracked whoever
did this to here.

11:09.551 --> 11:11.184
Okay, I'm just saying,

11:11.285 --> 11:14.421
you've been going through
a lot lately

11:14.522 --> 11:16.690
and dealing with some
conflicting feelings.

11:16.791 --> 11:18.431
I'm not conflicted, okay?
JT was attacked.

11:18.459 --> 11:19.626
And you want
to protect him.

11:19.727 --> 11:21.261
I get that.

11:21.362 --> 11:22.763
But isn't it possible
that you're making

11:22.864 --> 11:25.165
a bigger deal out of this
than it really is?

11:25.266 --> 11:28.634
I mean, the shackle was mine,
it wasn't even yours.

11:28.735 --> 11:31.137
And I don't really care
about it, so why should you?

11:31.238 --> 11:34.040
Because if JT's right, it's
a connection to my past, okay?

11:34.141 --> 11:38.010
To our past.
How can you not care about that?

11:38.112 --> 11:40.646
I just want to focus
on the future, our future,

11:40.747 --> 11:42.281
Vincent Keller's future.

11:42.382 --> 11:44.784
My future is connected
to my past, okay?

11:44.885 --> 11:47.152
Finding out who I was
and where I come from,

11:47.253 --> 11:49.288
it helps me figure out
who I actually am

11:49.389 --> 11:51.791
because it's real, okay?
It's not another lie.

11:51.892 --> 11:55.194
And if it gives me the answers,
then I am for it.

11:58.798 --> 12:00.165
What?

12:00.266 --> 12:01.900
I don't know.

12:02.001 --> 12:03.702
It... just...

12:03.803 --> 12:07.906
the more you focus on the past,
the more I...

12:08.007 --> 12:09.708
worry that means Cat.

12:09.809 --> 12:13.378
This has nothing
to do with Catherine.

12:16.248 --> 12:17.482
Hey...

12:17.583 --> 12:19.918
trust me.

12:22.788 --> 12:24.689

tracking him.

crew or is it just us?

13:42.098 --> 13:43.738

to ask no questions.

Apologize.

What?!

What do you want
us to do?

15:47.498 --> 15:48.765
Not piss me off.

15:48.866 --> 15:50.634
Okay, what's his problem?

15:50.735 --> 15:52.001
Pete? Long story.

15:52.102 --> 15:53.804
He doesn't treat you
very well.

15:53.904 --> 15:55.739
Well...

15:55.840 --> 15:57.607
I'm just saying.
I wouldn't put up with it.

15:57.709 --> 15:58.608
No, you don't.

15:58.710 --> 16:00.343
I like that about you.

16:00.444 --> 16:01.845
But be careful with Pete.

16:01.946 --> 16:02.979
He's got a hair-trigger.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.147
He'll go off on you.

16:04.248 --> 16:05.648
Why do you put up with it?

16:05.749 --> 16:07.183
Wish I didn't have to,
believe me,

16:07.284 --> 16:10.820
but Pete's the only family
I got left.

16:10.921 --> 16:12.288
We used to have
another brother, Rick,

16:12.389 --> 16:14.290
but he died--
cops shot him.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.625
So that's the only reason
you're doing this, for him?

16:16.727 --> 16:17.626
He's family.

16:17.728 --> 16:19.027
Can't just walk away.

16:19.128 --> 16:21.029
I know what you mean.

16:21.130 --> 16:24.166
I'm just saying,
letting go is never easy,

16:24.267 --> 16:26.769
no matter who
the relationship's with.

16:26.870 --> 16:28.671
Let me guess, old boyfriend?

16:28.772 --> 16:30.138
Yeah.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.674
Recent?
Very.

16:31.775 --> 16:33.041
This your idea of a rebound?

16:33.142 --> 16:36.178
No, this is my idea
of being me again,

16:36.279 --> 16:37.880
separate from anybody else.

16:46.555 --> 16:47.689
Pulls to the left.

16:47.790 --> 16:48.990
I'll fix that.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.491
Plastic?
Everything but the bullets.

16:50.559 --> 16:52.460
But those are easy to get
past metal detectors.

16:52.561 --> 16:56.130
All right, we'll reconvene
here tomorrow at 0500.

16:56.231 --> 16:58.199
Make sure you're changed
and ready to roll.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.735
Oh, wait, I thought
we were gonna go over

17:00.836 --> 17:02.370
how we're gonna get
the gem.

17:02.471 --> 17:05.506
0500...

17:05.607 --> 17:06.839
sharp.

17:17.484 --> 17:20.054
Wait-- you tracked Cat?

17:20.155 --> 17:23.189
You're-You're
kidding, right?

17:23.290 --> 17:26.527
Okay, not kidding.

17:26.627 --> 17:28.060
I don't know what happened.

17:28.162 --> 17:29.763
I mean, the guy
that attacked you, right?

17:29.798 --> 17:32.733
I sensed him, right here,
and then I tracked him.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.267
At least I thought
I tracked him...

17:34.368 --> 17:35.368
Tracked him where?

17:35.470 --> 17:37.237
First, to his place, I think.

17:37.338 --> 17:41.841
And then he wasn't there,
so I tracked him to some bar.

17:41.943 --> 17:43.103
And that's where you saw Cat?

17:43.177 --> 17:44.610
Yeah.

17:44.711 --> 17:46.012
W-Was she in danger?

17:46.113 --> 17:47.547
'Cause, you know,
in the past,

17:47.648 --> 17:49.549
you could always sense
when she was in danger.

17:49.650 --> 17:51.684
No, she wasn't in any danger.

17:51.785 --> 17:53.386
In fact,
she was kissing somebody.

17:53.487 --> 17:55.087
What? Who?

17:55.188 --> 17:56.188
I don't know who, JT.

17:56.289 --> 17:57.523
Come on,
does it matter?

17:57.624 --> 17:58.925
No, just curious.

17:59.025 --> 18:01.427
No wonder Tori
bailed, though.

18:01.528 --> 18:03.228
She's got high hopes.

18:03.330 --> 18:05.765
She obviously likes the special
connection you two share.

18:05.866 --> 18:08.233
I know, and I tried
to explain it to her.

18:08.335 --> 18:11.470
I tried, but I can't
even explain it to myself.

18:11.571 --> 18:14.273
Okay, look, first of all,

18:14.374 --> 18:16.141
give yourself a break.

18:16.242 --> 18:18.743
I mean, let's face it--
you're not gonna get over Cat

18:18.845 --> 18:20.779
in a couple of weeks, right?
She's gonna mess

18:20.880 --> 18:22.881
with your head for a while.
Women do that.

18:22.983 --> 18:24.616
Okay, that is not helping.

18:24.717 --> 18:27.086
You gotta clear your head,
take charge, focus.

18:27.187 --> 18:29.220
Okay.
You left here on a mission,

18:29.321 --> 18:30.489
a beast mission,

18:30.590 --> 18:32.557
and that's real.
It still is.

18:32.658 --> 18:34.759
I-I can't explain why
it led you to Catherine.

18:34.861 --> 18:37.328
Maybe you got your
emotional wires crossed

18:37.429 --> 18:39.163
or something,
I don't know, but, dude!

18:39.264 --> 18:41.666
Come on, beast up!

18:41.767 --> 18:44.102
Beast up?
Yeah!

18:44.203 --> 18:46.570
Get back in the game,
trust your instincts.

18:46.671 --> 18:49.340
Finding the shackle
helps find you, remember?

18:49.441 --> 18:52.510
Now get back out there

18:52.611 --> 18:56.280
on that thief's trail
and go kick some ass!

18:56.382 --> 18:57.915
Okay.

18:58.017 --> 18:59.850
Avenge me!

19:02.954 --> 19:04.488
What the hell?!

19:07.125 --> 19:08.025
Where's the shackle, huh?!

19:08.126 --> 19:10.528
Why'd you steal it?

19:10.629 --> 19:11.529
Screw you.

19:11.630 --> 19:13.797
Talk or die-- you choose.

19:13.899 --> 19:16.366
I was hired to steal it.

19:16.467 --> 19:17.600
Hired by who?

19:17.701 --> 19:19.869
I don't know-- I swear.

19:21.439 --> 19:23.273
What do they want with it?

19:23.374 --> 19:25.275
It goes with the gem.

19:25.376 --> 19:27.644
Gem? What gem?

19:27.745 --> 19:29.046
What gem?!

19:29.147 --> 19:31.481
At the Russian consulate.

19:31.582 --> 19:33.216
The consul's wife.

19:33.317 --> 19:35.618
So, you're after that, too, hmm?

19:35.719 --> 19:38.555
Good, now we're
getting somewhere.

19:38.656 --> 19:39.656
Tell me about this gem.

19:39.757 --> 19:42.559
Screw... you.

20:20.429 --> 20:22.263
So this is their leader.

20:22.364 --> 20:24.084
Pete Franco, armed robbery
and murder.

20:24.166 --> 20:26.286
His brother was killed in Miami
a couple of years ago.

20:26.335 --> 20:27.402
Yeah, I know-- Rick.

20:27.503 --> 20:28.936
You got close enough
for him to tell you that?

20:29.037 --> 20:31.106
No, his other brother Patrick
told me.

20:31.207 --> 20:33.174
Patrick? I don't know who that is.
He's not in the book.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.509
He isn't.
He's reluctant.

20:34.610 --> 20:36.111
He's also my "in,"
so I want to do

20:36.212 --> 20:37.245
whatever I can to protect him.

20:37.346 --> 20:39.180
But who is protecting you?

20:39.281 --> 20:40.514
Well, I haven't needed
protection in the past.

20:40.616 --> 20:42.083
I don't need it now.

20:42.183 --> 20:44.251
But now we know that these guys
are sophisticated enough

20:44.352 --> 20:45.953
to make plastic guns.
For what?

20:46.054 --> 20:48.689
At least we know it's
to get some sort of a gem,

20:48.790 --> 20:50.390
and they're gonna have to go
through a metal detector.

20:50.492 --> 20:52.359
I've got my my people looking for...
For what?

20:52.460 --> 20:54.194
It could be any one
of a thousand

20:54.295 --> 20:55.930
high-profile targets
in New York.

20:56.031 --> 20:57.464
CATHERINE; Okay, this guy goes
by "Shorty."

20:57.565 --> 20:59.633
Mm-hmm. Catherine...
Gabe,

20:59.734 --> 21:01.368
They are going to kill people.
I'm sure of it.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.370
If I'm not there to stop them...
Okay, wait.

21:03.471 --> 21:04.871
Why can't we arrest them

21:04.972 --> 21:06.640
when they reconvene
at the warehouse?

21:06.741 --> 21:09.309
For what-- making
plastic guns?

21:09.410 --> 21:11.211
Franco's on the FBI's Most
Wanted List, that's something.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.812
Okay, but this doesn't tell us
what they're after,

21:12.913 --> 21:14.247
or more importantly,
who's behind all of this.

21:14.348 --> 21:17.083
Catherine,
these people are dangerous.

21:17.184 --> 21:18.785
Yes, and we've been in more
dangerous situations before.

21:18.886 --> 21:19.786
You know that.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.721
That's not the point.

21:21.822 --> 21:24.423
Gabe, I want to follow through
with this-- I have to.

21:24.525 --> 21:25.646
Besides, I thought
we already

21:25.693 --> 21:27.160
had this conversation.

21:27.261 --> 21:28.795
This isn't about us,
this is about you.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.900
All right, fine.

21:35.001 --> 21:36.001
Will you at least wear a wire?

21:36.102 --> 21:37.770
Please?

21:37.871 --> 21:41.440
Okay.

21:46.780 --> 21:49.014
Where is everybody?

21:49.115 --> 21:50.148
Where's your girlfriend?

21:50.249 --> 21:51.583
She's not my girlfriend.

21:51.684 --> 21:52.844
Yeah, well, she's still late.

21:59.559 --> 22:00.458
What's the matter?
You tell me.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.626
What're you talking about?

22:01.727 --> 22:02.794
Shorty's dead.

22:02.895 --> 22:03.961
What?

22:04.063 --> 22:05.363
Someone killed
him, Patrick,

22:05.464 --> 22:07.665
which means someone is onto us.

22:08.934 --> 22:10.267
So where's Mara?

22:10.368 --> 22:11.903
How the hell should I know?

22:13.205 --> 22:14.165
Wait, are you saying...?

22:14.206 --> 22:15.166
That is what I'm saying.

22:17.209 --> 22:18.976
And if I'm right, she's dead.

22:21.947 --> 22:24.315
Sorry I'm late.

22:27.419 --> 22:28.819
What's the matter?

22:31.289 --> 22:34.658
You're wearing the wrong outfit.

22:37.329 --> 22:39.395
And I think you're a cop.

22:49.372 --> 22:50.773
So we're going for a boat ride.

22:50.874 --> 22:54.109
Just so you know,
I get a little seasick.

22:54.210 --> 22:56.644
You have the signal scanner?

22:56.745 --> 22:58.613
Got it.

22:58.714 --> 23:00.582
I don't know what
to be more insulted by--

23:00.683 --> 23:02.184
the fact that you think
I'm a cop,

23:02.285 --> 23:04.018
or you think
I'm dumb enough to wear a wire.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.654
Well, we're about to find out.

23:08.257 --> 23:09.524
Pete, come on,
this is crazy.

23:09.625 --> 23:11.426
She knew the meeting point,

23:11.527 --> 23:13.127
she fits the description,
she kicks ass.

23:13.228 --> 23:15.096
There's no way she's a cop.
No?

23:15.197 --> 23:17.599
Then where was she
when Shorty was killed?

23:17.700 --> 23:19.801
And why...

23:19.902 --> 23:21.836
would she change into that?

23:21.937 --> 23:25.473
It's not my fault my
instructions weren't specific.

23:25.574 --> 23:26.641
Mine were.

23:26.742 --> 23:28.675
Theirs were.

23:28.776 --> 23:31.979
The man who hired us is
pretty specific.

23:40.622 --> 23:42.723
Now if this beeps,

23:42.824 --> 23:45.025
you will end up at the bottom
of the Hudson

23:45.126 --> 23:46.627
like the last Fed we caught.

23:46.728 --> 23:47.894
I don't think so.

23:47.996 --> 23:49.362
No?

23:49.463 --> 23:50.864
Why is that?

23:50.965 --> 23:53.199
The current flows toward

23:53.300 --> 23:55.435
the 28th Street Docks,
not away from it.

23:57.772 --> 24:00.340
Mm.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.019
Wire's dead.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.854
No, don't!

24:14.955 --> 24:17.089
Maybe she got wet on purpose,
to short the wire.

24:17.191 --> 24:18.190
Yeah, or maybe not.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.992
Damn it,
why did I listen to her?

24:20.093 --> 24:21.393
Look, just stay here,

24:21.494 --> 24:22.862
and call if she comes
back online, okay?

24:22.963 --> 24:25.497
Gabe...

24:25.598 --> 24:27.199
I know.

24:30.503 --> 24:33.505
Hurry, we got company!

24:33.606 --> 24:34.806
You shouldn't
have shot at her.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.074
Shut up and get in!

24:41.181 --> 24:44.449
Now, let's try this again.

24:44.551 --> 24:47.553
One beep and you're dead.

25:10.209 --> 25:12.643
Told you she was clean.

25:12.744 --> 25:15.079
I don't get it.
Why'd you put up a fight?

25:15.180 --> 25:17.021
I told you, I don't like
people threatening me.

25:17.048 --> 25:19.183
You do it again and I'm out.

25:22.754 --> 25:24.121
Drive.

25:24.222 --> 25:26.690
Back to the warehouse.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.072
Who is it?

25:43.173 --> 25:45.508
It's me, Mara.

25:49.947 --> 25:51.748
Hey.

25:51.849 --> 25:53.683
I just, uh, you know,

25:53.784 --> 25:55.352
I wanted to make sure
that you were all right.

25:55.453 --> 25:57.653
Do you mind?

26:00.624 --> 26:03.092
Thank you.

26:03.193 --> 26:05.161
And thank you for sticking up
for me over there.

26:05.262 --> 26:07.930
I know it took a lot for you
to stand up to your brother.

26:08.031 --> 26:10.099
I'm just lucky he
didn't shoot me.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.002
I'd be more worried
about him getting you shot.

26:15.472 --> 26:17.038
I know that you feel
like you owe him, Patrick,

26:17.140 --> 26:18.940
but you also owe yourself.

26:19.041 --> 26:20.643
Don't be afraid
to make a change.

26:20.744 --> 26:22.678
Just do it
before it's too late.

26:28.385 --> 26:29.885
Hey! Let's go!

26:31.954 --> 26:34.022
Showtime.

26:42.631 --> 26:45.033
I need divers
at the 28th Street Docks, stat.

26:45.134 --> 26:46.967
Wait!
Stand by.

26:47.068 --> 26:47.968
What is it?

26:48.069 --> 26:49.404
Heel marks.

26:49.505 --> 26:50.805
That could be a sign from her.

26:50.906 --> 26:52.139
Or, they dragged her,
which means...

26:52.240 --> 26:53.641
You don't shoot
someone at the docks

26:53.742 --> 26:55.242
and take them with you.

26:55.344 --> 26:56.511
You sink the body.

26:56.612 --> 26:57.978
What are you saying?

26:58.079 --> 26:59.414
I'm saying we trust her.

26:59.515 --> 27:01.382
We let it play out.

27:01.483 --> 27:02.684
Are you sure?

27:02.785 --> 27:05.352
The only thing I am sure of

27:05.453 --> 27:07.254
is that I am worried sick.

27:10.125 --> 27:12.426
How long have you been
in love with her?

27:54.300 --> 27:56.068
Where'd he get the I.D.'s?

27:56.169 --> 27:57.970
From the real caterers.

27:59.138 --> 28:00.539
You don't want to know.

28:05.579 --> 28:06.779
Uh-huh.

28:51.722 --> 28:54.124
Now remember, technically,
we're on Russian soil,

28:54.225 --> 28:56.826
which means if we get caught,
it's Siberia,

28:56.928 --> 28:59.629
not Rikers, got it?

28:59.730 --> 29:02.365
Ian and I will take out
the guards in security.

29:02.466 --> 29:04.667
Mara, you pick the keys
of the consul general.

29:04.768 --> 29:06.469
He's over there.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.170
Get them to Patrick.

29:08.271 --> 29:10.272
After we take out surveillance,
get to the third floor ducts.

29:10.373 --> 29:12.508
You'll have five minutes tops

29:12.609 --> 29:13.809
to get the gem out of the safe

29:13.877 --> 29:14.811
in the bedroom and back here

29:14.912 --> 29:16.072
before all hell breaks loose.

29:16.079 --> 29:17.012
Any questions?

29:17.113 --> 29:19.081
What if all hell breaks loose?

29:22.819 --> 29:24.053
Shoot to kill.

29:41.671 --> 29:42.537
Champagne, sir.

29:45.808 --> 29:47.175
I am so sorry.

29:47.276 --> 29:48.710
Let me get you a towel.

29:58.320 --> 29:59.053
Smooth.

29:59.154 --> 30:01.155
Keep his wife drinking.

30:01.256 --> 30:02.756
We need her to stay downstairs.

30:06.462 --> 30:07.528
Be careful.

30:07.629 --> 30:08.929
You, too.

30:16.872 --> 30:18.539
Champagne?

30:18.640 --> 30:20.407
Thank you.

30:20.509 --> 30:22.242
Vincent?

30:24.345 --> 30:25.779
Well, it looks like
you have little fans

30:25.881 --> 30:27.180
everywhere in America now.

30:27.281 --> 30:29.216
Don't you, Mr. Keller?

30:31.652 --> 30:33.220
Yes.

30:34.788 --> 30:37.391
Yes, I do. Cheers.

30:39.092 --> 30:40.425
Why are you following me?

30:40.526 --> 30:41.426
I'm not following you.

30:41.527 --> 30:42.861
I think was here first.

30:42.962 --> 30:43.829
Yeah? Then why'd you follow me

30:43.930 --> 30:45.164
to the bar last night?

30:45.265 --> 30:46.165
I didn't follow you
to the bar.

30:46.266 --> 30:47.132
In fact, what were you doing

30:47.233 --> 30:48.200
at the bar last night?

30:48.301 --> 30:49.382
Same thing I'm doing here--

30:49.435 --> 30:50.502
working on a case.

30:50.603 --> 30:51.837
So don't blow my cover.

30:51.938 --> 30:53.172
I see-- so that's why you had

30:53.273 --> 30:54.634
your tongue down
some guy's throat?

30:54.640 --> 30:55.540
What? You jealous?

30:55.641 --> 30:58.777
No, not at all.

30:58.877 --> 31:00.445
Look, I don't know what case
you're on, Catherine,

31:00.546 --> 31:02.186
but just keep your
distance from me, okay?

31:02.281 --> 31:03.214
Why, what are you
doing here

31:03.316 --> 31:04.649
besides flirting with danger?

31:04.750 --> 31:05.784
I'm on a case, too.

31:05.884 --> 31:07.151
So don't blow my cover.

31:07.252 --> 31:08.386
War hero?

31:08.487 --> 31:10.488
Not much of a cover.

31:10.589 --> 31:12.489
Wait, what case are you on?
What're you after?

31:12.590 --> 31:14.058
Why would you even care?

31:14.159 --> 31:15.492
Because you, me, here now?

31:15.593 --> 31:17.394
It's all too much
of a coincidence.

31:17.495 --> 31:19.330
Especially if we're both
after the gem.

31:19.431 --> 31:21.032
The gem.

31:21.133 --> 31:22.300
How do you know
about the gem?

31:22.400 --> 31:23.634
How's that possible?

31:23.735 --> 31:26.070
I don't know,
cruel cosmic hoax?

31:26.171 --> 31:28.138
Did you know that
JT was attacked?

31:28.239 --> 31:29.373
What? No.

31:29.474 --> 31:30.714
Yeah, you remember
that skeleton

31:30.775 --> 31:32.142
that belonged
to Tori's dad?

31:32.243 --> 31:33.377
They broke in,
stole the shackle,

31:33.478 --> 31:34.878
and now they
want this gem.

31:34.979 --> 31:36.079
So this is
about beasts?

31:36.180 --> 31:37.381
You didn't know?
No.

31:37.482 --> 31:38.549
I thought it was about
anything but beasts.

31:38.650 --> 31:39.817
That's why I volunteered.

31:39.917 --> 31:41.218
Well, that's a shame,

31:41.319 --> 31:42.680
'cause I'm not
letting you anywhere

31:42.754 --> 31:44.054
near that gem, okay?
It belongs to me now.

31:44.155 --> 31:45.355
Well, you can't stop me.

31:45.456 --> 31:46.990
Is that so, Detective?

31:47.091 --> 31:48.158
What, you gonna expose me,

31:48.259 --> 31:49.159
risk an international incident?

31:49.260 --> 31:50.693
Absolutely.

31:52.429 --> 31:53.997
I want to know who's
after that thing

31:54.098 --> 31:55.431
and what they
know about me.

31:55.532 --> 31:57.334
Well, I want to know
whoever's after the gem

31:57.434 --> 31:59.336
so I can stop them from
killing innocent people.

31:59.436 --> 32:01.036
Don't cross me,
Catherine, okay?

32:01.137 --> 32:02.438
I mean it.
Yeah, well,

32:02.539 --> 32:04.240
don't make me shoot
you again, Vincent.

32:05.642 --> 32:07.610
And I mean that.

32:46.315 --> 32:47.482
You sure we're alone?

32:49.084 --> 32:50.285
Of course.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.056
No cameras?

32:55.157 --> 32:56.958
Trust me, I can't
afford being caught

32:57.059 --> 32:58.393
any more than you can.

32:58.493 --> 33:00.295
So hurry, unzip me.

34:07.394 --> 34:08.293
Who the hell are you?

34:17.436 --> 34:18.637
Don't.

34:18.737 --> 34:19.771
I won't let you hurt him.

34:30.581 --> 34:32.417
That gem is mine.

34:32.518 --> 34:33.851
No, it's not.

34:45.197 --> 34:47.097
You killed Shorty,
didn't you?

34:47.197 --> 34:49.199
And I'll kill him, too,
if you're not careful.

35:01.279 --> 35:03.047
What happened to you?

35:17.709 --> 35:18.977
You gotta get your stuff
and clear out of here.

35:19.078 --> 35:20.411
It won't be long
before FSB

35:20.512 --> 35:22.313
ties you to your brother.
Aw, Pete.

35:22.414 --> 35:23.648
What's gonna happen to him?
Same thing that's gonna

35:23.749 --> 35:25.382
happen to you if
you don't disappear.

35:25.484 --> 35:27.404
Patrick, listen to me--
you don't have much time.

35:27.486 --> 35:29.153
They're gonna track you down
and they're gonna think

35:29.254 --> 35:30.655
that you're the one that
got away with the gem.

35:30.756 --> 35:31.889
Me?
What about the other guy?

35:31.990 --> 35:32.924
The guy who actually took it?

35:33.024 --> 35:33.945
They'll never find him.

35:34.025 --> 35:35.460
How do you know?

35:35.561 --> 35:37.294
Because... he's smart.

35:37.395 --> 35:39.330
He never would've done this
if he didn't have an alibi.

35:39.431 --> 35:41.999
And he's good at
covering his ass.

35:42.100 --> 35:43.767
Listen,
forget about him.

35:43.868 --> 35:46.170
This might be your only chance
to walk away from this

35:46.271 --> 35:47.771
and have the life
that you want.

35:47.872 --> 35:49.974
It's too late
to help Pete,

35:50.075 --> 35:52.009
but it's not too late
to help yourself.

35:52.110 --> 35:54.344
What about you?

35:54.445 --> 35:57.814
Where do you
go from here?

35:57.915 --> 36:00.116
Well, let's just say that
I have a bone to pick

36:00.217 --> 36:01.250
with the person that

36:01.352 --> 36:02.519
recommended me
for this gig.

36:04.956 --> 36:06.590
Good luck, Patrick.

36:06.691 --> 36:08.792
You, too, Mara.

36:20.437 --> 36:22.705
<i>Wait, if you didn't get</i>
<i>the gem, then who did?</i>

36:22.806 --> 36:24.374
- I don't know.
- How do you not know?

36:24.475 --> 36:26.842
You were undercover,
that's why you were there.

36:26.943 --> 36:28.377
I mean, the Russians
certainly don't have it.

36:28.478 --> 36:29.879
They've already called
the State Department

36:29.980 --> 36:31.213
to complain about
being infiltrated.

36:31.314 --> 36:32.681
Are they turning over
Pete and Ian?

36:32.782 --> 36:34.222
What happens at
the Russian consulate

36:34.317 --> 36:35.518
stays at the consulate.

36:37.587 --> 36:39.354
Any idea where
the other one is?

36:39.455 --> 36:41.490
No.

36:41.591 --> 36:43.492
You sure you're not
keeping anything from me?

36:43.592 --> 36:45.193
Why, are you?

36:46.462 --> 36:49.064
About the assignment, I mean.

36:49.165 --> 36:50.399
The gem.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.867
Why you just happened
to choose me for this.

36:52.968 --> 36:54.836
You put my life at risk

36:54.937 --> 36:56.505
by not telling me the whole
story, Agent Landon,

36:56.605 --> 36:58.340
and I think
I deserve to know why.

36:58.441 --> 37:00.374
What makes you think so?

37:03.612 --> 37:05.013
Wait.

37:05.113 --> 37:06.280
Don't go.

37:08.517 --> 37:10.217
The truth is I've had
my eye on you for awhile,

37:10.318 --> 37:11.586
Detective Chandler,

37:11.687 --> 37:13.354
even before you
arrested your father.

37:18.193 --> 37:20.761
Is this the gem
that they were after?

37:22.297 --> 37:23.531
How did you know?

37:23.631 --> 37:25.899
I didn't; but I suspected.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.001
There's a pattern

37:28.103 --> 37:29.836
with what all these
gangs are after.

37:29.938 --> 37:31.858
I've been trying to connect
the dots for years...

37:33.441 --> 37:35.576
...ever since my husband
was murdered.

37:35.677 --> 37:37.377
I don't understand.

37:37.478 --> 37:39.379
Sam was an archeologist.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.847
He was helping
us on a case,

37:40.949 --> 37:42.449
and whatever he discovered
got him killed.

37:42.550 --> 37:44.451
It's the same
curious pattern

37:44.552 --> 37:45.953
of artifacts stolen,

37:46.054 --> 37:47.253
the same pattern
that led me

37:47.354 --> 37:49.021
to your father and to you.

37:49.123 --> 37:51.924
There's something strange
that's happening,

37:52.025 --> 37:53.193
something extraordinary,

37:53.294 --> 37:54.927
and I can't put
my finger on it,

37:55.028 --> 37:57.697
but I'm not gonna
stop until I do.

37:57.798 --> 38:00.400
I think you have an idea
of what I'm talking about.

38:05.872 --> 38:07.907
London, 1836.

38:10.510 --> 38:11.443
Is that the same gem?

38:11.544 --> 38:12.812
Scotland Yard found it

38:12.913 --> 38:14.080
at a murder scene.

38:14.180 --> 38:15.314
In fact, it's been found

38:15.415 --> 38:16.816
at many murder
scenes ever since,

38:16.917 --> 38:18.637
including one that
your father investigated.

38:20.253 --> 38:22.621
Look who was helping
Scotland Yard.

38:22.722 --> 38:24.656
Rebecca Reynolds.

38:24.757 --> 38:28.260
Okay, you think I'm related
to this woman?

38:28.361 --> 38:29.495
You are related to her.

38:29.596 --> 38:30.762
On your father's side.

38:30.863 --> 38:32.297
I checked.

38:32.398 --> 38:33.665
Just one of
the many dots

38:33.766 --> 38:35.501
that I'm trying
to connect.

38:35.602 --> 38:38.937
But one thing is for sure:

38:39.038 --> 38:41.072
there is something
about this gem

38:41.173 --> 38:43.374
that is definitely
connected to you, Catherine.

38:56.921 --> 38:58.656
Huh. Perfect fit.

38:58.757 --> 39:00.824
So what does it mean?

39:00.925 --> 39:02.926
Actually, I have no idea.

39:03.028 --> 39:04.162
Especially since

39:04.263 --> 39:05.763
tools to cut
precious gems

39:05.864 --> 39:07.831
weren't even around when
this creature was alive.

39:07.932 --> 39:10.034
Okay, so maybe
the shackle's

39:10.135 --> 39:11.935
not connected to
the creature at all.

39:12.037 --> 39:14.271
Except when you factor
in flesh and fur,

39:14.372 --> 39:16.606
it fits perfectly around
that thing's neck.

39:16.708 --> 39:18.308
It's a collar.

39:18.409 --> 39:20.044
A collar?

39:20.145 --> 39:21.311
So, what,

39:21.412 --> 39:24.114
the-the chain is...
is a leash?

39:24.215 --> 39:25.783
Hard to imagine
what else it could be.

39:25.884 --> 39:27.651
Which implies

39:27.751 --> 39:29.052
somebody was
controlling it.

39:29.153 --> 39:31.188
Okay, so why the gem?
What does it do?

39:31.289 --> 39:33.290
Could be just ornamental.

39:33.391 --> 39:35.559
No, someone went to far too much
trouble to try and get it

39:35.660 --> 39:36.959
for it to be
ornamental.

39:37.061 --> 39:38.861
It's gotta do something,
or be something.

39:38.962 --> 39:40.297
The question is what?

39:40.398 --> 39:41.631
Too bad you can't ask

39:41.732 --> 39:43.012
whoever hired
the gang to get it.

39:43.067 --> 39:44.400
Well, I will.

39:44.501 --> 39:45.702
I'll find them.

39:45.803 --> 39:47.336
Because obviously,
they know a lot more

39:47.437 --> 39:49.072
about my beast side than I do...

39:51.008 --> 39:52.675
...and I want to know
what they know.

39:52.776 --> 39:54.276
You're not the only one.

39:56.646 --> 39:58.581
I'm just saying,
your feelings for Cat aside,

39:58.682 --> 40:01.016
this is just as much
about Tori as you.

40:01.117 --> 40:02.685
Fight it
all you want,

40:02.785 --> 40:04.220
but the truth
is you share

40:04.321 --> 40:05.921
a unique connection
with her.

40:06.022 --> 40:07.690
A primal connection.

40:07.790 --> 40:12.228
You may be the only two
beasts left on the planet.

40:24.506 --> 40:25.607
Relax. She's fine.

40:25.708 --> 40:28.543
She could've died, Tess.

40:28.644 --> 40:29.778
On my watch.

40:29.879 --> 40:31.046
But she didn't.

40:31.147 --> 40:32.413
You listened to
what she wanted,

40:32.514 --> 40:33.781
not what you
wanted for her.

40:33.882 --> 40:35.350
That's a good thing.

40:35.451 --> 40:36.917
Yeah, except now she's
probably accepting

40:37.018 --> 40:38.418
Agent Landon's offer
to keep working

40:38.487 --> 40:39.621
on these damn heists.

40:39.722 --> 40:41.789
Well, then, if you
really care for her,

40:41.890 --> 40:43.370
you're gonna have
to keep letting her.
