WEBVTT

00:06.903 --> 00:09.424
3 percent rise
in domestic violence calls.

00:10.068 --> 00:12.252
So the Thanksgiving week
always brings an uptick.

00:12.573 --> 00:15.478
Families starting to gather.
In-laws in town.

00:15.503 --> 00:18.073
If the pilgrims and indians
could find a way.

00:18.098 --> 00:19.767
Maybe the first Thanksgiving
was cause they were

00:19.792 --> 00:21.468
just to worn out
to fight anymore.

00:22.011 --> 00:23.662
Where's the file
I asked you for?

00:24.058 --> 00:25.714
It's on your desk, sir.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.450
Oh.

00:29.336 --> 00:31.167
Thank you Baker.

00:36.381 --> 00:38.009
What about this Raymond thing?

00:38.657 --> 00:41.298
Corporation counsel was served
today with a lawsuit.,

00:41.323 --> 00:43.429
alleging police brutality.

00:43.793 --> 00:45.898
It claims, that two days ago,

00:45.923 --> 00:47.870
Raymond assaulted an
eight-year-old boy

00:47.895 --> 00:50.868
living on the same block
as his partner, Officer Donohue.

00:51.912 --> 00:53.103
Is the boy ok?

00:53.128 --> 00:55.846
After two hour in ER,
and multiple stitches.

00:55.871 --> 00:58.784
His father, an attorney,
named

00:59.170 --> 01:01.171
Preston Morris, says his son is

01:01.173 --> 01:03.423
"totally traumatized
by the attack,"

01:03.425 --> 01:06.509
and went straight to the
media after filing the suit.

01:06.511 --> 01:08.795
And we have no idea
why it happened.

01:08.797 --> 01:10.013
Not even from his partner.

01:10.015 --> 01:12.732
Far as anyone can tell,
Raymond just snapped.

01:12.734 --> 01:15.134
Goes without saying,
the optics are bad on this.

01:15.136 --> 01:18.304
Sterling record,
decorated twice for heroism.

01:18.306 --> 01:20.490
This is not that.

01:20.492 --> 01:24.143
He is entitled to the same
presumption of innocence

01:24.145 --> 01:27.480
afforded any other member
of my department.

01:27.482 --> 01:28.698
You'll let Legal handle it?

01:28.700 --> 01:30.667
Yes, Mrs. Reagan.

01:30.669 --> 01:32.318
Moving on.

01:39.493 --> 01:41.327
Vic was a hell of a cop.

01:41.329 --> 01:44.264
But he would be the first to say
he wasn't the best

01:44.266 --> 01:46.516
in the family.

01:46.518 --> 01:49.352
That would belong
to Colleen over there.

01:49.354 --> 01:52.021
In fact,

01:52.023 --> 01:54.274
we partnered for a while.

01:54.276 --> 01:56.843
And then she was assigned
to Vic,

01:56.845 --> 02:01.698
who said that that was
the happiest day of his life.

02:01.700 --> 02:04.617
Until, of course,
Brendan and Meara

02:04.619 --> 02:06.903
came along.

02:08.856 --> 02:11.858
May the Lord bless
Vic McGuire

02:11.860 --> 02:14.377
and keep his family
in His heart.

02:20.134 --> 02:22.502
You did good, Reagan.

02:22.504 --> 02:23.419
Thanks, Roy.

02:23.421 --> 02:25.255
Fly was open
the entire time though.

02:25.257 --> 02:27.006
Up yours, Roy.

02:29.994 --> 02:32.211
Thank you, Henry.

02:33.848 --> 02:35.982
How you doing?

02:35.984 --> 02:37.150
I'm hanging in there.

02:37.152 --> 02:38.885
This place

02:38.887 --> 02:42.155
already seems so empty
without him.

02:42.157 --> 02:44.223
You'll see him again one day.

02:45.910 --> 02:47.911
Don't be a stranger.

02:47.913 --> 02:50.280
Okay.

02:54.919 --> 02:56.252
This doesn't make sense.

02:56.254 --> 02:58.404
Brendan, I am not
imagining things.

02:58.406 --> 03:00.506
What you're saying is crazy.
I'm...

03:00.508 --> 03:01.758
Hi, kids.

03:02.626 --> 03:04.794
Hey, Mr. Reagan.

03:06.630 --> 03:08.097
Look...

03:08.099 --> 03:11.935
I've been through this
a little bit.

03:11.937 --> 03:14.470
You got to go day by day.

03:14.472 --> 03:16.022
But it will

03:16.024 --> 03:18.191
get better.

03:18.193 --> 03:19.809
Go on. Say it.

03:20.728 --> 03:22.228
Say what?

03:23.764 --> 03:26.316
Unless Dad didn't just die.

03:26.318 --> 03:28.434
What do you mean?

03:30.504 --> 03:33.706
I think Mom might've had
something to do with his death.

03:33.708 --> 03:36.275
Meara, your father died
of cancer.

03:36.277 --> 03:38.494
He's been sick
for the last eight months.

03:38.496 --> 03:39.946
No, but he was better last week.

03:39.948 --> 03:41.247
Mr. Reagan, she is just upset.

03:41.249 --> 03:42.882
And you're not?

03:42.884 --> 03:44.450
Listen to what
you're saying,

03:44.452 --> 03:46.252
Meara. It's your mother.

03:46.254 --> 03:50.289
I know how it sounds, and maybe
she didn't do anything to Dad.

03:51.675 --> 03:54.894
But I think she did.

How the hell can you
not love Thanksgiving?

04:09.527 --> 04:11.427
Six hours of cooking,
ten minutes of eating

04:11.429 --> 04:12.795
and then a food coma?

04:12.797 --> 04:14.097
What's wrong with a food coma?
Give me

04:14.099 --> 04:15.415
any other holiday, please.

04:15.417 --> 04:17.500
Detectives.
What do you got, Sarge?

04:17.502 --> 04:19.619
Hispanic male,
stabbed to death,

04:19.620 --> 04:21.204
found by the owner
of this bar over there.

04:21.206 --> 04:22.989
Yeah, I came out to
take out some empties,

04:22.991 --> 04:24.507
and I almost stepped on him.

04:24.509 --> 04:25.675
You ever seen him before?

04:25.677 --> 04:27.794
Just inside,
watching the football.

04:27.796 --> 04:29.429
I'm missing
a football game tonight?

04:29.431 --> 04:32.432
I think he means soccer.
Yeah, Venezuela versus Chile!

04:32.434 --> 04:33.716
Right!

04:33.718 --> 04:35.601
Soccer's not football.

04:35.603 --> 04:40.506
And it looks like the game
is officially over for this guy.

04:40.508 --> 04:42.775
Wallet...

04:42.777 --> 04:45.812
appears to be intact.

04:45.814 --> 04:47.730
Wasn't a robbery.

04:47.732 --> 04:50.400
Single stab wound
to the chest.

04:50.402 --> 04:51.818
Judging by
the angle,

04:51.820 --> 04:54.070
the killer is left-handed.

04:54.072 --> 04:57.640
Gabriel Vega, 26 years old.

04:57.642 --> 04:59.492
He lives about three blocks
from here.

04:59.494 --> 05:01.828
I'd say Mr. Vega came
out for a smoke,

05:01.830 --> 05:03.379
killer approached
to bum one,

05:03.381 --> 05:05.298
stabbed him before he lit up.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.051
You psychic?
'Cause I only see the one.

05:08.053 --> 05:10.036
Uh, no. There's another one
right there.

05:10.038 --> 05:11.754
Saw it on
the way in.

05:11.756 --> 05:13.256
You got

05:13.258 --> 05:14.490
security cameras
here?

05:14.492 --> 05:17.827
No, I don't but other businesses
in the area do.

05:17.829 --> 05:19.429
All right. Uh, Sarge,

05:19.431 --> 05:22.381
can you have your guys round 'em
all up, everything within

05:22.383 --> 05:24.517
a five-block radius?
Of course.

05:24.519 --> 05:25.719
Well, if this isn't a robbery,

05:25.720 --> 05:28.237
you got a motive for why
somebody wanted him dead?

05:30.025 --> 05:33.242
Maybe he was cheering
for the wrong soccer team.

05:37.948 --> 05:39.866
Step aside. Kill those TVs.

05:39.868 --> 05:41.984
Please, sir, this is one of my
biggest nights of the year.

05:41.986 --> 05:43.536
Not anymore it isn't.

Now, here's how
it's gonna go down.

I want Chile fans

Venezuela fans over here
on the bar.

Reagan, Baez. How's your

Hi, Meara.

07:02.939 --> 07:04.689
I'm so glad you called.

07:04.691 --> 07:05.890
Your mom isn't here?

07:05.892 --> 07:07.492
No, she's at the store.

07:07.494 --> 07:10.027
Okay.

07:10.029 --> 07:12.046
Are you, uh...

07:12.048 --> 07:13.898
you feeling any better?

07:13.900 --> 07:16.918
I tried.
Brendan says I'm wrong.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.403
But he didn't see what I saw.

07:19.405 --> 07:22.039
Which was?
The way Mom's been recently.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.742
I saw her reading
Dad's life insurance policy

07:24.744 --> 07:26.744
over and over.

07:26.746 --> 07:29.046
And a week ago Saturday,
I swear to God,

07:29.048 --> 07:32.416
she was on this computer
doing a search on euthanasia.

07:32.418 --> 07:36.521
Well, people look up
all kinds of things online.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.940
Even when your husband is dying?

07:38.942 --> 07:41.726
Meara,

07:41.728 --> 07:43.761
what you're describing

07:43.763 --> 07:45.930
is a crime
and a mortal sin.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.865
I know that.

07:47.867 --> 07:50.618
I'm neither a cop
nor a priest.

07:52.505 --> 07:55.489
Well, you better
show me.

07:55.491 --> 07:58.543
She searched "euthanasia"

07:58.545 --> 08:01.546
and clicked on this link.

08:01.548 --> 08:04.882
"Last Exit Collective,

08:12.141 --> 08:14.425
Oh, my God.

08:14.427 --> 08:18.262
Did your dad ever talk
about ending it all?

08:18.264 --> 08:20.181
Never. You saw him last week.

08:20.183 --> 08:22.233
He was sitting up,
he was making jokes.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.568
Has she received

08:23.570 --> 08:26.153
any parcels recently?

08:27.022 --> 08:28.956
She got a box last week.

08:28.958 --> 08:31.659
It had a U.S. Customs
stamp on it.

08:31.661 --> 08:34.812
Then she was
shredding something.

08:34.813 --> 08:37.081
Oh, Meara.

08:37.082 --> 08:39.533
I'm not sure what you want
from me here.

08:39.534 --> 08:42.870
Please prove to me
my mom didn't do this.

08:42.871 --> 08:44.121
Meara?

08:44.123 --> 08:45.423
You home?
In here, Mom.

08:45.425 --> 08:48.826
Honey, I wanted
you to help me

08:48.828 --> 08:50.344
with this...

08:50.346 --> 08:51.996
Henry.

08:51.998 --> 08:53.931
What are you doing here?

08:53.933 --> 08:56.300
Well, I got all the way home
last night and realized

08:56.302 --> 09:00.054
that I left my glasses right
here on your kitchen counter.

09:00.056 --> 09:02.940
Henry,

09:02.942 --> 09:06.227
I sweated enough perps
in my life to know

09:06.229 --> 09:08.012
when I'm getting fed a line.

09:08.014 --> 09:11.198
You told me not
to be a stranger.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.700
Did I tell you

09:12.702 --> 09:14.619
he was the flirtiest partner
I ever had?

09:14.621 --> 09:16.821
And that includes your father.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.289
Doesn't surprise me.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.125
Come on.
Help me unload the car, Romeo.

09:33.472 --> 09:35.089
That's not Raymond.

09:35.091 --> 09:37.725
Commissioner Reagan.

09:37.727 --> 09:39.310
Officer Donohue.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.678
Raymond's kenneled,
per protocol.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.396
I'm just helping out
with Kurtis here and...

09:42.398 --> 09:43.881
trying to stay busy.

09:46.217 --> 09:49.603
Pretty serious lawsuit
we got on our hands.

09:49.605 --> 09:51.605
It's a load of crap,
respectfully.

09:51.607 --> 09:54.108
Raymond's the best partner
I've ever had.

09:54.110 --> 09:56.277
He's never gone after anyone
other than perps

09:56.279 --> 09:58.496
and, then, only on my orders.
And he loves kids.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.748
Plays with my niece Annie
all the time.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.566
Maybe that boy provoked him.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.919
We're not gonna blame
the victim here.

10:04.921 --> 10:06.620
Yes, sir.

10:06.622 --> 10:09.457
How did Raymond get out
of your yard?

10:09.459 --> 10:11.342
Sir, I have no idea.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.543
He's getting up there.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.628
His days of jumping the fence
to get laid are over.

10:14.630 --> 10:16.764
And I keep that gate padlocked,

10:16.766 --> 10:17.848
always.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.249
Yet he got out.

10:19.251 --> 10:20.417
Well, there's
no evidence

10:20.419 --> 10:23.137
of that. But the padlock
had disappeared.

10:23.139 --> 10:27.308
He also had points deducted
last year

10:27.310 --> 10:30.361
at the National Field
Trials after making

10:30.363 --> 10:33.114
a secondary bite
on the simulated attacker.

10:33.116 --> 10:34.865
Raymond got kicked
in the takedown.

10:34.867 --> 10:37.618
But he's never had a negative
incident with the public.

10:37.620 --> 10:39.370
He's given his life to service.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.821
He deserves a happy retirement,

10:40.823 --> 10:43.157
not some shyster
says he's a killer.

10:43.159 --> 10:44.875
It's not right.

10:46.945 --> 10:48.963
I want to see your partner.

10:48.965 --> 10:50.614
This way.

10:50.616 --> 10:52.133
<i>Fuss!</i>

11:05.147 --> 11:07.631
Five more days like this.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.650
If the rabies and
behavior evaluations

11:09.652 --> 11:11.852
come back on time.

11:14.806 --> 11:16.607
May I?

11:16.609 --> 11:19.060
Sir, he's confined
to kennel. I...

11:19.062 --> 11:21.245
I'm the police
commissioner.

11:29.538 --> 11:32.656
You use "Ray"
for command purposes?

11:32.658 --> 11:34.008
Yes, sir.

11:34.010 --> 11:35.492
Ray.

11:35.494 --> 11:37.144
Come.

11:45.771 --> 11:47.805
You know something about this.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.891
I do.

12:07.042 --> 12:08.659
Down.

12:10.195 --> 12:12.079
Stay.

12:17.385 --> 12:19.553
Come!

12:21.056 --> 12:23.174
Heel.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.042
Good boy.

12:25.877 --> 12:28.062
Good boy.

12:40.391 --> 12:42.726
He didn't do it.

12:48.950 --> 12:50.501
Anything?

12:50.503 --> 12:51.669
Nothing.

12:51.671 --> 12:54.238
All I got are a bunch
of dark, empty streets.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.257
Well, I'll trade you
for the cross-dresser

12:56.259 --> 12:59.543
that looks just like
Sergeant Gormley.

12:59.545 --> 13:02.379
Come on, killer, killer,

13:02.381 --> 13:05.599
where is our killer?

13:05.601 --> 13:07.384
Hold on.

13:07.386 --> 13:09.937
I found a guy running
out of that alley.

13:09.939 --> 13:12.256
Time code matches Vega's T.O.D.

13:14.309 --> 13:16.426
Hello, dirtbag.

13:16.428 --> 13:18.279
You mean, hello, Tic-Tac.

13:18.281 --> 13:20.114
What, you know the guy?

13:20.116 --> 13:21.649
Wish I didn't.

13:21.651 --> 13:24.434
Why do they call him Tic-Tac?
Because if it

13:24.436 --> 13:26.203
looks like a pill,
he'll swallow it,

13:26.205 --> 13:28.155
along with any other drug.

13:28.157 --> 13:29.606
Uh-huh. So he's a junkie.

13:29.608 --> 13:31.125
Is he capable of murder?

13:31.127 --> 13:33.944
Tic-Tac's capable of anything.

13:42.137 --> 13:43.754
Nice neighborhood.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.455
Tic-Tac lives in
one of these dumps

13:45.457 --> 13:47.675
when he's not nodding off
in some shooting gallery.

13:47.677 --> 13:50.144
Yeah. You seem to know
a lot about this guy.

13:50.146 --> 13:51.896
What's your history with him?

13:51.898 --> 13:53.597
There he is.

13:53.599 --> 13:56.066
All right, I'll go around.

13:56.068 --> 13:59.653
Flush him out to me.
Actually, can you do the flushing?

14:10.081 --> 14:11.532
Tic-Tac!

14:13.868 --> 14:16.153
Where you going?

14:16.955 --> 14:20.457
Look what the cat
coughed up, huh?

14:20.459 --> 14:22.659
What do you want with me?

14:23.378 --> 14:25.095
Hey!

14:26.965 --> 14:29.300
Put it down.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.801
I'm clean!
Put it down!

14:30.803 --> 14:32.803
I didn't do anything!
I don't give a damn!

14:32.805 --> 14:34.488
I said drop it!

14:38.944 --> 14:41.678
What is this, Baez?
Something I'm missing here?

14:41.680 --> 14:45.199
I guess I should've said--
his real name is Javi.

14:45.201 --> 14:46.817
He's my brother.

14:47.685 --> 14:49.203
Really?

14:52.123 --> 14:54.041
Come on.

15:04.815 --> 15:06.683
In a cell;
lock it twice.

15:06.685 --> 15:07.717
Yeah, I gotcha.

15:07.719 --> 15:10.403
All right, this way.
To the back.

15:10.405 --> 15:12.839
When were you gonna tell
me he was your brother?

15:12.841 --> 15:14.841
You do realize I almost
shot him, right?

15:14.843 --> 15:16.042
You would've
done me a favor.

15:16.044 --> 15:17.477
Whoa, whoa. What's
the story with you?

15:17.479 --> 15:19.579
What do you want to know?
How me and Javi

15:19.581 --> 15:20.614
were best friends growing up?

15:20.616 --> 15:22.282
How he wanted
to stay back a grade

15:22.284 --> 15:24.201
so we could be
in all the same classes?

15:24.203 --> 15:25.477
Or how that all
ended when he met

15:25.478 --> 15:27.095
a <i>new</i> best friend
in a bag of dope?

15:28.406 --> 15:30.674
You know, maybe you ought
to sit this one out.

15:30.676 --> 15:32.042
Excuse me?

15:32.044 --> 15:34.678
You're his sister.
Not as far as I'm concerned.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.631
No, you are, and you proved it
by pushing him through a glass door.

15:37.633 --> 15:40.267
You're busting me on how
I took down a hump? You?

15:40.269 --> 15:43.053
Oh, come on...
Everything okay out here?

15:43.055 --> 15:46.256
No, Sarge... the guy
we like for Vega's murder

15:46.258 --> 15:48.258
happens to be Baez's
older brother.

15:48.260 --> 15:49.693
Which is irrelevant,

15:49.695 --> 15:51.394
unless family is now
outlawed around here--

15:51.396 --> 15:53.096
which means Danny's
gonna get pretty lonely

15:53.098 --> 15:55.431
without somebody from his
dropping by every other day.

15:55.433 --> 15:57.234
My family members
aren't murder suspects

15:57.236 --> 15:59.069
who I pushed
through a door.

15:59.071 --> 16:00.737
It doesn't matter
who Javi is.

16:00.739 --> 16:02.772
It only matters that
he killed Vega.

16:02.774 --> 16:04.245
No, it matters how you
handle the situation...

16:04.270 --> 16:05.276
All right,

16:05.277 --> 16:06.442
listen up, listen up.

16:06.444 --> 16:07.994
Both of you talk to him.

16:07.996 --> 16:09.412
But I'll be nearby.

16:15.970 --> 16:18.788
I figured since you
used to work in the lab...

16:18.790 --> 16:22.625
that you might help me
piece this thing together.

16:22.627 --> 16:25.262
Does Colleen know you went
digging in her shredder?

16:25.264 --> 16:27.981
Nah, I had to grab it
when she wasn't looking.

16:27.983 --> 16:30.016
Okay.

16:31.569 --> 16:33.903
Let's start sorting this mess.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.772
By hand?

16:35.774 --> 16:37.824
Whatever it takes
to prove to Meara

16:37.826 --> 16:39.492
that her mother didn't do this.

16:39.494 --> 16:41.945
What I mean is, they got
computer programs now

16:41.947 --> 16:43.530
that use algorithms

16:43.532 --> 16:46.032
to put these together.

16:46.034 --> 16:48.501
Match shred marks,
predict word patterns.

16:48.503 --> 16:50.287
I didn't know you kept up.

16:50.289 --> 16:52.922
Some of us stay young, Reagan.

16:52.924 --> 16:57.794
Says the guy who's taken
three leaks since he got here.

17:00.048 --> 17:02.682
Now I just send this scan
to the laptop,

17:02.684 --> 17:05.852
and let the program
do its thing.

17:05.854 --> 17:08.471
I'll be damned.

17:08.473 --> 17:10.473
So, you don't think
she offed Vic.

17:12.226 --> 17:16.146
No. Not the Colleen <i>I</i> know.

17:16.147 --> 17:19.983
I always wanted
to ask you about that.

17:19.984 --> 17:21.984
Yeah. I know.

17:21.987 --> 17:24.371
There was talk.

17:24.373 --> 17:26.705
Can't say I'm surprised.

17:27.523 --> 17:29.192
Colleen and I...

17:30.077 --> 17:31.861
Not that we ever acted on it...

17:31.863 --> 17:34.297
So what are you telling <i>me</i> for?

17:35.833 --> 17:38.301
I don't know.
I never told anyone.

17:38.303 --> 17:40.337
Family, friends.

17:40.339 --> 17:41.888
No one.

17:41.890 --> 17:43.807
She feel the same way?

17:43.809 --> 17:47.177
Not that she ever
came out and said.

17:48.646 --> 17:51.147
But I had the boss reassign her.

17:51.149 --> 17:54.067
That's how she and Vic
got partnered?

17:55.486 --> 17:59.939
That's how Betty and I
stayed together for 46 years.

18:03.577 --> 18:05.028
Ah.

18:05.030 --> 18:07.563
It's a drug receipt.

18:07.565 --> 18:09.582
She bought

18:09.584 --> 18:12.168
a bottle of pentobarbital.

18:13.571 --> 18:15.238
Aw...

18:19.660 --> 18:21.511
You hang back.

18:21.513 --> 18:24.464
Your homework assignment
in 1,000 words or less

18:24.466 --> 18:25.965
is to write down

18:25.967 --> 18:27.684
why you killed
Gabriel Vega.

18:27.686 --> 18:29.469
Who is Gabriel Vega?
The guy

18:29.471 --> 18:31.971
you stabbed in an alley
in Spanish Harlem last night.

18:31.973 --> 18:34.023
You're out of your mind.

18:34.025 --> 18:36.693
And you're high as a kite.
Just go ahead and confess, Javi.

18:38.897 --> 18:41.281
We got you coming
out of the alley on video

18:41.283 --> 18:43.099
moments after Vega
was stabbed and killed.

18:43.101 --> 18:45.869
I already told you,
I didn't kill anyone.

18:45.871 --> 18:47.654
And why should I believe
a junkie like you?

18:47.656 --> 18:49.572
Because I'm clean.

18:50.574 --> 18:51.741
Three months. Look.

18:51.743 --> 18:53.493
I don't have
any fresh marks.

18:53.495 --> 18:56.446
So, where are you shooting up
now, between your toes?

18:56.448 --> 18:57.881
People change.

18:57.883 --> 18:58.965
Not you.

18:58.967 --> 19:00.500
What were you doing
in the alley?

19:00.502 --> 19:02.552
I was coming
home from work.

19:02.554 --> 19:04.971
Where do you work?
Who the hell would hire you?

19:06.590 --> 19:09.926
You want to know? Huh?

19:09.928 --> 19:11.978
CZE Tech.
You always knew

19:11.980 --> 19:13.796
I was good with computers.

19:13.798 --> 19:16.299
Oh, so what now, you're hacking
people's credit card numbers

19:16.301 --> 19:17.600
and buying drugs?
I don't...

19:19.520 --> 19:21.404
I don't do drugs.

19:21.406 --> 19:23.490
That's enough, all right?

19:23.492 --> 19:26.459
What were you doing
in the alley?

19:26.461 --> 19:28.077
The gu..

19:28.079 --> 19:30.029
um, Vega, he's smoking,

19:30.031 --> 19:32.031
and I-I bummed a smoke from him.

19:32.033 --> 19:34.117
Some other guy
comes out of nowhere,

19:34.119 --> 19:36.703
and he just starts stabbing him.
This other guy,

19:36.705 --> 19:38.321
what'd he look like?
I don't know.

19:38.323 --> 19:40.123
I was... I was running.

19:40.125 --> 19:41.708
Just like you ran from us.

19:41.710 --> 19:43.265
You think I want to talk
to a bitch like you?

19:43.290 --> 19:44.328
What did you call me?

19:44.329 --> 19:45.512
You cut me off

19:45.514 --> 19:47.380
two years ago.
Yeah, it was 20 years

19:47.382 --> 19:48.548
too late,
All right, all right...

19:48.550 --> 19:51.167
you stupid piece of crap!
Officer! Step outside.

19:52.686 --> 19:54.053
You. Hey.

19:54.055 --> 19:56.189
Start writing.
Everything you remember,

19:56.191 --> 19:58.858
put it down.

19:58.860 --> 20:01.144
You know, you two are
worse than my kids.

20:01.146 --> 20:03.696
You didn't buy any of that.
Actually, I did buy it.

20:03.698 --> 20:05.848
Look, your brother's no angel,
but he looks clean

20:05.850 --> 20:07.484
and his work I.D. seems legit.

20:07.486 --> 20:09.786
You kidding me?
Did you see him catch the pen

20:09.788 --> 20:11.237
with his right hand?
The stab wounds

20:11.239 --> 20:12.355
on the victim
were consistent

20:12.357 --> 20:13.873
with a left-handed killer.
Hey, boss,

20:13.875 --> 20:15.658
you were listening--
you can't agree with him.

20:15.660 --> 20:16.543
Actually, I do.

20:16.545 --> 20:17.994
And I just
called Javi's boss

20:17.996 --> 20:19.362
at CZE Tech,
and he's confirmed

20:19.364 --> 20:20.663
he's been employed
for three months

20:20.665 --> 20:21.881
and passed every blood test.

20:21.883 --> 20:23.049
He's not our guy.

20:23.051 --> 20:24.033
Innocent people don't run

20:24.035 --> 20:25.552
from the cops.
Your brother might

20:25.554 --> 20:27.670
be guilty of something;
he's not guilty of murder.

20:27.672 --> 20:29.973
Get his statement;
cut him loose.

20:29.975 --> 20:31.707
I'll but him loose.

20:31.709 --> 20:34.010
You see if you can
come up with some reason

20:34.012 --> 20:36.479
why someone would want
to kill Gabriel Vega.

20:39.216 --> 20:41.100
You talked to the dog's handler.
Yes, I did.

20:41.102 --> 20:42.986
After you said you'd stay away.
Cut it out.

20:42.988 --> 20:44.871
<i>You</i> cut it out.
I can't do my job

20:44.873 --> 20:46.823
if you're gonna undermine me.
How is getting

20:46.825 --> 20:48.358
a firsthand field report
undermining you?

20:48.360 --> 20:51.578
You talk to the kid who got bit?
No.

20:51.580 --> 20:54.864
Dog bites boy,
Reagan checks in on <i>dog?</i>

20:54.866 --> 20:57.083
What's wrong with
this picture?

20:57.901 --> 20:59.252
Oh.

20:59.254 --> 21:01.754
"Oh"? That's all you got?

21:01.756 --> 21:03.590
It's a shakedown, Garrett.

21:03.592 --> 21:05.575
Well, score one
for their side.

21:05.577 --> 21:07.910
Well... we got the
truth on our side.

21:07.912 --> 21:09.212
They've got

21:09.214 --> 21:11.347
the optics on theirs!

21:12.801 --> 21:16.252
Does the name Greta
mean anything?

21:23.594 --> 21:25.612
Yes, it does.

21:25.614 --> 21:27.763
It's also my job
to know things, Frank.

21:27.765 --> 21:29.399
Like, motivation?

21:29.401 --> 21:32.018
You ran a dog

21:32.020 --> 21:34.203
named Greta in K-9
back in the '80s.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.656
But only that one. Why?

21:36.658 --> 21:38.541
I couldn't cut it.

21:38.543 --> 21:39.909
And that has nothing to do

21:39.911 --> 21:41.995
with Greta being shot and killed
by the burglar

21:41.997 --> 21:44.163
you sent her in after?

21:48.218 --> 21:51.804
Let's just leave it at that--
I couldn't cut it.

21:55.142 --> 21:58.294
I know you're not gonna
let this go, but...

21:58.296 --> 22:00.563
let me do my job.

22:04.518 --> 22:08.137
I know how these things
are supposed to go.

22:08.139 --> 22:12.108
It is cheaper and quieter
to settle out of court.

22:13.944 --> 22:18.281
But any settlement would include
an order to put that dog down.

22:20.868 --> 22:23.002
And that can't happen.

22:26.123 --> 22:29.709
Gabriel worked
at my tire shop.

22:31.630 --> 22:33.663
He was a good boy.

22:33.665 --> 22:35.682
He loved soccer.

22:35.684 --> 22:38.935
So no enemies you know of?

22:38.937 --> 22:41.854
Who wouldn't want
to be his friend?

22:41.856 --> 22:45.525
The only bad thing
he did was smoke.

22:46.510 --> 22:48.811
I'm very sorry for your loss,
Mr. Vega.

22:48.813 --> 22:54.033
This officer is gonna take you
to identify your son.

22:56.019 --> 22:59.238
And if there's anything else,
here's my card.

23:03.043 --> 23:04.160
No enemies, no debts.

23:04.162 --> 23:05.878
Why is this not
making any sense?

23:05.880 --> 23:08.414
Hmm. Maybe we're looking
at it wrong.

23:08.416 --> 23:09.699
How so?

23:09.701 --> 23:11.050
What if Vega wasn't the target?

23:11.052 --> 23:13.052
But then who? Javi?

23:13.054 --> 23:16.205
The killer was going
after your brother,

23:16.207 --> 23:19.225
and somehow Vega got himself
in the way.

23:19.227 --> 23:21.277
Who would want
to kill my brother?

23:21.279 --> 23:22.512
He's a nobody.

23:22.514 --> 23:24.263
Well, all your brother's cases
are connected

23:24.265 --> 23:26.149
to one man-- Benny Russo.

23:26.151 --> 23:27.400
Who is...?

23:27.402 --> 23:30.186
Mid-level heroin dealer.

23:30.188 --> 23:32.905
Narcotics has never been able
to pin a case on him.

23:32.907 --> 23:34.123
Launders everything

23:34.125 --> 23:36.192
through a legit business--
this lumberyard.

23:36.194 --> 23:37.777
And my brother was
in bed with him.

23:37.779 --> 23:40.747
Your brother was a cross-town
mule in exchange for drugs.

23:40.749 --> 23:42.532
Seems this Russo's
a bit of a hothead,

23:42.534 --> 23:43.583
and is a little paranoid

23:43.585 --> 23:45.168
when it comes
to his ex-employees.

23:45.170 --> 23:47.403
He thinks
they're all gonna rat on him.

23:47.405 --> 23:49.872
Like... his former
accountant here,

23:49.874 --> 23:52.709
who was shot point blank
in the forehead a year ago.

23:52.711 --> 23:54.267
Well, that's a different M.O.
than stabbing.

23:54.292 --> 23:55.078
No.

23:55.079 --> 23:56.629
Both crimes are up-close
and personal,

23:56.631 --> 23:58.581
which would indicate rage
or revenge.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.850
So, maybe
your brother gets clean,

24:00.852 --> 24:03.586
walks out on Russo,
he gets paranoid, thinking,

24:03.588 --> 24:06.189
Javi might run
to his sister, the cop.

24:06.191 --> 24:08.257
Russo decides
to go after him.

24:08.259 --> 24:11.227
And Gabriel Vega was just a good
Samaritan who tried to stop it?

24:11.229 --> 24:12.595
Sounds right.

24:12.597 --> 24:14.930
I'm gonna kick his ass for
not telling us any of this.

24:14.932 --> 24:18.484
Yeah, well, now you're gonna
have to wait in line.

24:21.489 --> 24:25.124
Coming in, Javi!

24:25.959 --> 24:28.878
Javi?

24:28.880 --> 24:31.914
Son of a bitch.

24:31.916 --> 24:34.283
Call a bus!
Oh, my God.

24:34.285 --> 24:37.136
Call a bus!

24:37.138 --> 24:39.305
Is... Is he alive?

24:39.307 --> 24:41.290
Barely.

24:43.310 --> 24:44.761
This is Detective Reagan.

24:44.763 --> 24:48.464
We need a bus forthwith,
re apparent overdose.

24:58.046 --> 24:59.672
I knew he wouldn't
be able to stay clean.

24:59.673 --> 25:01.628
Yeah, and I knew this was
gonna be too personal for you.

25:01.653 --> 25:02.842
What?

25:02.843 --> 25:04.710
Partner, you've been screwing up
since we got started,

25:04.712 --> 25:06.661
and I'm not letting
either one of us get killed

25:06.663 --> 25:07.880
'cause you're too close to this.

25:07.882 --> 25:10.399
Not everyone has a family where
the worst thing that happens

25:10.401 --> 25:12.167
is someone's late
to Sunday dinner.

25:12.169 --> 25:14.836
Just try to understand.

25:14.838 --> 25:17.189
Javi tore our family apart.

25:17.191 --> 25:20.442
The lies, the stealing,
the money my parents spent

25:20.444 --> 25:21.810
trying to keep him clean.

25:21.812 --> 25:24.513
They split up because of
what he put us all through.

25:24.515 --> 25:27.866
That's why
you don't like Thanksgiving.

25:27.868 --> 25:29.851
After everything Javi did,

25:29.853 --> 25:32.988
there was nothing to celebrate
or anyone who wanted to.

25:32.990 --> 25:36.208
'Least I saw a lot
of cops growing up.

25:36.210 --> 25:38.210
Made me want to become one.

25:38.212 --> 25:40.829
Yeah, well, something good
came of it, I guess.

25:40.831 --> 25:43.198
Can we just go nail Benny Russo?

25:43.200 --> 25:45.834
I don't know, partner? Can we?

25:46.702 --> 25:49.037
I'm fine, Reagan.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.058
All right.

25:53.060 --> 25:55.594
Go sit with your brother
till he wakes up.

25:55.596 --> 25:58.380
I'll see if I can't make
some traction with Benny Russo.

26:01.385 --> 26:02.651
Go ahead.

26:03.770 --> 26:06.188
Mr. Irving
to Volunteer Services.

26:06.190 --> 26:09.274
Mr. Irving
to Volunteer Services.

26:09.276 --> 26:12.361
<i>So, who's Benny Russo?</i>

26:12.363 --> 26:14.246
Benny Russo is a drug dealer

26:14.248 --> 26:16.198
who laughs in our face
every time he skates,

26:16.200 --> 26:18.167
which is every time
he gets pinched.

26:18.169 --> 26:19.952
Okay, so, what do
you need from me?

26:19.954 --> 26:21.403
I need a warrant
from your bosses.

26:21.405 --> 26:22.871
Off of what evidence?

26:22.873 --> 26:24.790
He tried to have
my partner's brother killed.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.208
He's a customer.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.043
And this guy killed
an innocent bystander instead.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.194
For the record,

26:29.196 --> 26:31.046
I do love this song
you always sing.

26:31.048 --> 26:33.715
I don't sing any song. What
song are you talking about?

26:33.717 --> 26:36.018
It's called "I'm Danny Reagan
and I Know Someone's Guilty

26:36.020 --> 26:38.520
Even if I Don't Have
Any Evidence to Back It Up."

26:38.522 --> 26:40.305
I do have evidence
to back it up!

26:40.307 --> 26:41.890
So, you have a murder weapon?

26:41.892 --> 26:44.359
I don't have a
murder weapon, no!

26:44.361 --> 26:46.228
Legitimate threats
against the brother?

26:46.230 --> 26:49.364
Baez's brother said
that Russo tried to kill him.

26:49.366 --> 26:52.767
Any witnesses
that are not junkies?

26:52.769 --> 26:53.952
Listen, Russo is a murderer.

26:53.954 --> 26:55.204
He killed his accountant!

26:55.206 --> 26:57.873
And he skated
because there was no evidence.

26:57.875 --> 26:59.825
He's a nut!
And you are halfway there,

26:59.827 --> 27:01.776
if you think
I'm gonna bring charges

27:01.778 --> 27:03.278
on a he said/he said

27:03.280 --> 27:05.780
between one guy who's never
spent a day in jail,

27:05.782 --> 27:08.283
and another who's been in
and out his whole life,

27:08.285 --> 27:09.635
when he's not too busy OD'ing.

27:09.637 --> 27:11.920
You know, I need to
find a new sister.

27:11.922 --> 27:14.806
You need to find me...
when you have more.

27:18.812 --> 27:21.630
So I didn't die.

27:23.299 --> 27:24.850
Not for lack of trying.

27:26.987 --> 27:29.488
Did you get Benny Russo?

27:29.490 --> 27:32.274
My partner went
to talk to his sister.

27:32.276 --> 27:34.443
She's an ADA.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.595
So...

27:36.597 --> 27:40.065
siblings <i>can</i> get along, huh?

27:40.067 --> 27:41.483
Weird, huh?

27:44.872 --> 27:48.590
I'm sorry...

27:48.592 --> 27:50.659
I didn't...

27:50.661 --> 27:53.545
I didn't tell you that
it was Russo who was after me.

27:56.433 --> 27:58.717
I just thought that...

27:58.719 --> 28:01.937
it would be one more thing
for you to hate me for.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.874
Stranger,

28:05.876 --> 28:09.394
you know, he does a, uh...

28:09.396 --> 28:13.348
good thing...

28:13.350 --> 28:15.867
and I ran like a coward.

28:15.869 --> 28:18.570
Maybe we can go talk
to Vega's family

28:18.572 --> 28:20.989
and tell them
how he tried to help you,

28:20.991 --> 28:22.157
after we get Russo.

28:22.159 --> 28:25.210
Which may not happen
any time soon.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.798
You're not the only one
with a difficult sibling.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.633
My sister says
we got no case,

28:31.635 --> 28:33.885
unless, of course,
we catch Russo in the act

28:33.887 --> 28:36.471
with about 50 witnesses
and 12 video cameras.

28:36.473 --> 28:37.589
So we're screwed?

28:38.976 --> 28:41.893
Unless we give him another
chance to finish the job.

28:41.895 --> 28:43.378
What?

28:43.380 --> 28:46.264
We use your brother
to flush him out.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.684
Like, dangle him
like bait? No!

28:48.686 --> 28:50.686
Russo's gonna come
after him again anyway.

28:50.688 --> 28:52.487
Unless he's cooled off.

28:52.489 --> 28:54.489
Do you think
that guy's gonna cool off?

28:54.491 --> 28:55.490
He's right, Maria.

28:55.492 --> 28:57.826
No, you shut up.
You're still groggy.

28:57.828 --> 29:00.495
No. I... I still know people.

29:00.497 --> 29:03.665
So I get the word out to Russo

29:03.667 --> 29:06.501
that I'm gonna be where
I used to score, tonight--

29:06.503 --> 29:08.737
Tenth and Butler.

29:08.739 --> 29:10.872
It's secluded.

29:10.874 --> 29:13.425
And he'll think
he has the drop on me.

29:14.510 --> 29:15.961
It's a good plan, partner.

29:15.963 --> 29:17.846
It's crazy.

29:17.848 --> 29:20.582
It's the only way we can make
sure your brother's protected.

29:20.584 --> 29:24.019
He's got to go down, Maria.

29:24.021 --> 29:26.438
And I... and I could help.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.757
And I want to help.

29:30.360 --> 29:33.211
Least I can do, right?

29:49.128 --> 29:51.313
Mr. Morris,
Frank Reagan.

29:51.315 --> 29:53.448
I know who you are.

29:53.450 --> 29:57.002
But I can't imagine
what you're doing here.

29:57.004 --> 30:00.756
I just like to get out of
the office once in a while.

30:00.758 --> 30:04.226
So, the department
is settling our suit?

30:04.228 --> 30:07.012
Depends on what
you mean by "settle."

30:07.014 --> 30:10.348
Well, by settle,
I mean monetary compensation

30:10.350 --> 30:12.818
for physical injury
and emotional stress.

30:12.820 --> 30:14.903
Then, no.

30:14.905 --> 30:17.639
But we are prepared
to forego a countersuit.

30:17.641 --> 30:19.441
Then this conversation's over.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.610
Not quite.

30:21.612 --> 30:23.495
We looked you up.

30:23.497 --> 30:25.030
Good for you.

30:25.032 --> 30:28.316
You go after deep pockets,
but always settle for less.

30:28.318 --> 30:31.820
But a lot of less
adds up nicely.

30:31.822 --> 30:34.456
Your dog bit my bo

30:34.458 --> 30:37.092
<i>A</i> dog bit your boy.

30:37.094 --> 30:38.376
I saw Raymond do it.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.880
Well, you told
the investigating sergeant

30:41.882 --> 30:43.765
that you were inside
at the time.

30:43.767 --> 30:45.767
What I mean is...

30:45.769 --> 30:47.686
I heard my son scream,

30:47.688 --> 30:49.638
and by the time I got outside,

30:49.640 --> 30:52.390
I saw your police dog
running off down the street.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.776
There were no witnesses

30:54.778 --> 30:58.396
that saw Raymond get out
of Officer Donohue's yard.

30:58.398 --> 31:01.316
So, you're saying,
I framed Raymond?

31:01.318 --> 31:04.453
No. You just said that.

31:04.455 --> 31:06.688
And if it wasn't him,
what dog bit my kid?

31:06.690 --> 31:07.906
I don't even have a dog.

31:07.908 --> 31:10.208
I don't know.

31:10.210 --> 31:12.527
The dog at your mother's house
in Queens?

31:12.529 --> 31:15.196
The rescue dog

31:15.198 --> 31:18.216
that you've tried repeatedly
to get them to take back?

31:18.218 --> 31:20.302
I don't know.

31:20.304 --> 31:22.387
Okay.

31:22.389 --> 31:25.056
We're done here.

31:31.046 --> 31:33.765
I've got a big megaphone,
Mr. Morris,

31:33.767 --> 31:35.851
and I know how to use it.

31:35.853 --> 31:38.353
Know one thing.

31:38.355 --> 31:40.555
We will not settle.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.909
I know you love your son.

31:43.911 --> 31:47.829
Do you really want to put him
on the stand to tell your lies?

31:51.250 --> 31:53.201
You're a real piece
of work, Reagan.

31:53.203 --> 31:57.522
Oh, please call me by my
first name-- Commissioner.

32:03.497 --> 32:05.931
What's going on?

32:22.865 --> 32:25.984
Tell me Vic was
in on this.

32:25.986 --> 32:30.205
I knew you didn't come here
to find your glasses.

32:30.207 --> 32:32.574
Was he?

32:33.409 --> 32:37.111
It was a decision
we made together.

32:48.507 --> 32:50.675
Check the seal.

32:52.812 --> 32:55.063
Unbroken.

32:56.966 --> 32:59.651
Last Tuesday...

32:59.653 --> 33:02.103
he was in so much pain.

33:03.806 --> 33:05.807
Oh, Henry,

33:05.809 --> 33:09.694
I, I came so close.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.646
But you didn't need to.

33:11.648 --> 33:14.315
I was going to say, I,

33:14.317 --> 33:17.151
I don't know if I could
have had the courage.

33:17.987 --> 33:20.288
Not sure that's
the word for it.

33:20.290 --> 33:25.210
Oh, believe me, Henry,
I've been there,

33:25.212 --> 33:27.512
and that is the word.

33:36.639 --> 33:39.524
We still friends?

33:39.526 --> 33:41.977
From the first day
we met.

33:41.979 --> 33:46.982
Henry, I want
to thank you... for caring,

33:46.984 --> 33:50.652
and I mean for all of us.

33:55.625 --> 34:00.211
When the time is right and
you want to have a meal,

34:00.213 --> 34:01.997
go see a movie...

34:03.033 --> 34:04.549
I'll know who to call.

34:08.871 --> 34:10.972
You okay up there, Javi?

34:10.974 --> 34:13.391
It's cold here, man.

34:13.393 --> 34:15.226
I still don't see Russo.

34:15.228 --> 34:16.393
Same here.

34:16.396 --> 34:18.045
Just sit tight.

34:18.047 --> 34:20.065
Ghosts 1 and 2,
when Russo shows up,

34:20.067 --> 34:22.400
do not make a move until
he makes a move first.

34:22.402 --> 34:23.351
You copy?

34:23.353 --> 34:26.353
Copy that.

34:26.356 --> 34:28.188
Reagan, I don't know
about this.

34:28.190 --> 34:31.242
Javi's got a stab vest
on under his jacket.

34:31.244 --> 34:32.494
He'll be fine.

34:34.246 --> 34:36.331
In fact, here
he comes now.

34:38.083 --> 34:40.735
Hey, Javi.

34:41.904 --> 34:43.505
How you doing, my man?

34:43.507 --> 34:45.907
Okay, Javi,
stay calm,

34:45.909 --> 34:47.676
stay in the light.

34:47.678 --> 34:49.744
Now act surprised
to see him.

34:51.097 --> 34:53.047
Hey, Benny.

34:53.050 --> 34:54.549
What you doing
out here?

34:54.551 --> 34:58.553
Well, a little bird told me you
might be out and about tonight.

34:58.555 --> 35:00.221
Don't worry,
I just want to talk.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.357
Won't take long.

35:03.442 --> 35:04.726
All right, wait
for my command.

35:04.728 --> 35:05.977
Copy that.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.729
Tell 'em to move in.
He's going to stab him.

35:07.731 --> 35:10.699
Give it a second.

35:10.701 --> 35:13.284
Hey, you tried
to kill me, man.

35:13.286 --> 35:17.105
Oh... yeah,

35:17.107 --> 35:20.658
you-- but you know
I get nuts sometimes.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.961
Little bird told me that
you also fell off the wagon

35:22.963 --> 35:25.246
last night.

35:26.082 --> 35:29.617
Sucks being clean, huh?

35:29.619 --> 35:31.619
Look, I just want to know
everything's good

35:31.621 --> 35:32.971
between me and you.

35:32.973 --> 35:35.140
No hard feelings, right?

35:39.145 --> 35:40.729
Come on.

35:40.731 --> 35:42.430
Sure.

35:42.432 --> 35:45.316
I don't want
to kill you, Javi.

35:46.468 --> 35:48.653
But I am going
to make you disappear.

35:49.238 --> 35:50.471
What the hell is this?

35:53.360 --> 35:54.409
No!
Get in the van!

35:54.411 --> 35:55.493
Move in, move in!

36:02.835 --> 36:04.702
Move your car!

36:04.704 --> 36:06.404
Where the hell did
they come from?

36:18.721 --> 36:20.054
Are they giving you anything?

36:20.056 --> 36:21.322
We don't even know
if they're still going

36:21.324 --> 36:23.074
in this direction.
Sarge, you locate

36:23.076 --> 36:25.409
the GPS signal
on my brother's cell phone yet?

36:25.411 --> 36:26.661
Hold on, still trying.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.247
Got it-- the cell phone's
signal is pinging

36:30.249 --> 36:32.533
off a cell tower in Queens.

36:32.535 --> 36:34.234
East on 73rd Avenue.

36:34.236 --> 36:36.170
East on 73rd Ave.

36:36.172 --> 36:37.672
Must be headed out of the city.

36:37.674 --> 36:39.573
Hollis Hills--
Russo's lumberyard

36:39.575 --> 36:40.741
is in Hollis Hills.

36:40.743 --> 36:41.676
That's where they're taking
your brother.

36:41.678 --> 36:42.927
Tell the sarge to send backup.

36:47.099 --> 36:48.599
Come on, let's go.

36:48.601 --> 36:49.884
I didn't rat on you!

36:49.886 --> 36:51.852
Let's go.
Hey!

36:51.854 --> 36:53.087
What are you doing?

36:53.089 --> 36:56.423
You're a junkie and
your sister's a cop.

36:57.592 --> 36:59.610
Turn that thing on.

36:59.612 --> 37:03.030
I didn't do it, I didn't do it.

37:03.032 --> 37:06.100
No... no, no,
what are you doing?

37:06.102 --> 37:07.702
Listen to me.

37:07.704 --> 37:08.736
Chop you up...

37:08.738 --> 37:10.321
No!
...hose off the back of that truck...

37:10.323 --> 37:13.124
No!
...and it'll be like you never existed.

37:14.110 --> 37:16.293
Let go of me!
Police! Let him go!

37:20.632 --> 37:22.783
Let him go!

37:25.254 --> 37:27.138
Hey, hey, hey.

37:27.140 --> 37:28.455
He's my brother,
I'm the only one

37:28.457 --> 37:29.957
that gets to kill him.

37:29.959 --> 37:31.225
Hey, look at me.

37:32.293 --> 37:34.461
Don't waste a bullet
on that scumbag, all right?

37:34.463 --> 37:36.296
Me maybe
but not you.

37:36.298 --> 37:37.631
It's not you.

37:41.853 --> 37:43.571
Then there's that.

37:45.407 --> 37:47.608
You okay, Javi?

37:56.334 --> 38:00.454
You saved me, Maria.

38:08.597 --> 38:10.765
Sit.

38:11.933 --> 38:13.834
He's coming along.

38:13.836 --> 38:16.270
Commissioner.

38:16.272 --> 38:17.688
About Raymond...

38:17.690 --> 38:20.024
Yes, sir.

38:20.026 --> 38:22.977
The lawsuit is dropped.

38:22.979 --> 38:27.531
I want the two of you
back on the job forthwith.

38:35.323 --> 38:38.125
For those who are about
to die, we salute you.

38:38.127 --> 38:41.545
He's already dead, Pop.

38:41.547 --> 38:42.963
It's the thought
that counts.

38:44.033 --> 38:45.716
How's Colleen holding up?

38:45.718 --> 38:48.219
About how you
would expect.

38:48.221 --> 38:52.539
You know, I don't think we
ever really talked about it.

38:52.541 --> 38:55.176
I was only 11 or 12
when you two were partners.

38:55.178 --> 38:57.044
Yeah, so?

38:57.046 --> 38:58.062
And I certainly
wasn't going

38:58.064 --> 38:59.597
to bring it up
in front of Mom.

38:59.599 --> 39:01.899
What's to bring up?

39:01.901 --> 39:03.400
Oh, come on.

39:03.402 --> 39:04.852
Come on, what?

39:08.073 --> 39:11.025
I had the biggest crush
on her.

39:11.027 --> 39:12.743
She was a babe.

39:15.697 --> 39:19.250
Yes, she, uh, she did
have her admirers.

39:19.252 --> 39:21.235
I'll bet.

39:26.676 --> 39:27.708
There we go.

39:27.710 --> 39:30.177
Everything looks so good.

39:30.179 --> 39:31.629
Smells even better.

39:31.631 --> 39:34.632
Wait, do we give thanks
before or after grace?

39:34.634 --> 39:36.800
Always before, Sean.

39:36.802 --> 39:39.470
Linda, go ahead.

39:39.472 --> 39:40.471
Oh, okay.

39:40.473 --> 39:43.390
Uh...

39:43.392 --> 39:47.027
this Thanksgiving
I am thankful for...

39:47.029 --> 39:49.429
Why do I have
to go first?

39:49.431 --> 39:51.065
You always go first.
- I'll go. - No, no, it's okay.

39:51.067 --> 39:52.599
Okay, um...
Time's up.

39:52.601 --> 39:54.101
Uh, my boys.

39:54.103 --> 39:55.486
Eh, you said that last year.

39:55.488 --> 39:56.570
I did?
Yeah.

39:56.572 --> 39:57.938
Well, let me do another.

39:57.940 --> 39:59.573
No, no, that was lovely,

39:59.575 --> 40:01.208
and the food's
getting cold.

40:01.210 --> 40:02.626
Okay.
Next.

40:02.628 --> 40:03.610
I'm thankful to have Drew Brees

40:03.612 --> 40:05.079
on my fantasy football team
this year.

40:05.081 --> 40:06.046
Ah.

40:06.048 --> 40:07.614
I'm thankful I
have the 2013

40:07.616 --> 40:10.050
New York Jets as
my real football team this year.

40:10.052 --> 40:11.118
Go, Gang Green!

40:11.120 --> 40:12.336
Whoo!

40:12.338 --> 40:13.837
And I'm thankful that
I have a beautiful wife

40:13.839 --> 40:15.589
and two sons who
put up with me

40:15.591 --> 40:18.625
'cause, believe me, it's not
that way in every family, and

40:18.627 --> 40:19.843
I'm also thankful
for that drumstick

40:19.845 --> 40:21.795
on the right,
which has my name on it.

40:21.797 --> 40:24.615
Me-- I'm just thankful for
what I'm always thankful for:

40:24.617 --> 40:28.102
to be happy to be kicking around
this place with all of you.

40:28.104 --> 40:29.570
I'm thankful

40:29.572 --> 40:31.305
for all the ordinary citizens
who have come up to me

40:31.307 --> 40:34.525
on the beat over the past year
and thanked me for my service--

40:34.527 --> 40:36.160
all two of 'em.

40:36.162 --> 40:38.078
Also, bulletproof vests.

40:39.647 --> 40:41.315
I'm thankful I only have
a year and a half left

40:41.317 --> 40:42.816
before I go to college.

40:42.818 --> 40:45.953
I'm thankful that she still
has a year and a half left

40:45.955 --> 40:47.588
before she goes
to college.

40:49.007 --> 40:51.125
And I'm thankful
for four generations

40:51.127 --> 40:54.628
of this family at this table,

40:54.630 --> 40:57.948
safe and sound and starving.

40:57.950 --> 40:59.266
Mm-hmm.

41:00.269 --> 41:01.468
Bless us, O Lord,

41:01.470 --> 41:04.021
for these, thy gifts which
we are about to receive

41:04.023 --> 41:05.889
from thy bounty.

41:05.891 --> 41:08.525
Through Christ, our Lord, amen.

41:08.527 --> 41:11.195
Amen.

41:11.197 --> 41:13.230
Who wants sweet potatoes?

41:13.232 --> 41:15.149
I'll take some.

41:15.151 --> 41:16.533
The turkey looks
amazing.

41:19.238 --> 41:22.815
Yeah, keep your hands off
the drumstick-- that one's mine.
