01:02.440 --> 01:05.440
—

01:09.043 --> 01:10.542
Good work, boys.

01:10.710 --> 01:12.057
Antonio! Antonio! Look at me.

01:12.081 --> 01:14.457
- You have to do like this.
- Yes, Father.

01:16.891 --> 01:18.426
The sun is going down.

01:18.456 --> 01:20.822
We should get San Pietro in the water.

01:20.854 --> 01:22.216
Come on, boys.

02:07.693 --> 02:11.128
My good people, I give you San Pietro.

02:16.174 --> 02:20.040
It is on this day we commence
the festival to celebrate

02:20.160 --> 02:22.651
the loving holiness he
brought to this land...

02:22.677 --> 02:24.201
of great fishermen.

02:29.299 --> 02:31.829
Viva! Viva!

02:46.010 --> 02:47.680
Che bei fuochi d'artificio.

02:48.703 --> 02:49.729
Eva!

02:50.136 --> 02:51.828
- Ma sei tu!
- Sì.

02:52.523 --> 02:54.515
- Che bello!
- Come stai?

02:54.542 --> 02:55.724
Bene.

02:55.744 --> 02:57.787
I didn't know if you were going to make it.

02:57.820 --> 02:59.560
Have I ever missed the festival?

02:59.585 --> 03:02.057
I know how busy you have
been with your new position.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.020
I've been following all of your adventures.

03:05.407 --> 03:07.845
Well, "adventures" is
not really the right word.

03:08.099 --> 03:09.428
But, yeah,

03:09.685 --> 03:12.114
I guess it's nice to do some good.

03:12.123 --> 03:14.628
Some good? You do a lot of good.

03:14.633 --> 03:16.314
If my brother could see you now.

03:16.340 --> 03:18.667
I know he would be so proud.

03:19.744 --> 03:22.400
I don't think my father would
have liked my life choice.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.451
He chose the life he did.

03:24.459 --> 03:26.708
Doesn't mean he didn't
want different for you.

03:26.735 --> 03:29.587
Help! There is a body in the water!

03:29.590 --> 03:30.714
Quick!

03:38.794 --> 03:40.142
Just over there.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.342
Oh my God!

03:41.608 --> 03:45.072
Antonio, Antonio, don't look.
Stay back, all of you boys!

03:45.073 --> 03:46.739
Don't look! Stay back!

03:53.499 --> 03:56.487
Probably a fisherman who
fell overboard somewhere.

03:56.741 --> 04:00.144
- I'm sorry the children had to see it.
- So am I.

04:00.611 --> 04:02.603
We'll know more once we
can I.D. the body but...

04:02.610 --> 04:04.142
that won't be easy.

04:04.157 --> 04:08.039
I would say, he has been in the
water at least a week, maybe more.

04:08.445 --> 04:11.085
Look like, uh, a titanium femur.

04:11.205 --> 04:12.967
Yes, I think it may be.

04:13.087 --> 04:15.028
I took a picture of the serial number.

04:15.234 --> 04:16.858
I may have a person who

04:16.870 --> 04:19.207
might be able to identify this body.

04:28.931 --> 04:29.999
Eva.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.714
I need you to run something for me.

04:31.725 --> 04:33.270
Well, hello to you too.

04:33.390 --> 04:35.708
You call and expect me to drop everything.

04:35.739 --> 04:36.968
Are you busy?

04:37.303 --> 04:39.336
No, not really. What do you need?

04:39.661 --> 04:42.280
A body washed ashore during
a festival I'm attending.

04:42.400 --> 04:47.057
And the victim has what looks
like, titanium femur I guess.

04:47.982 --> 04:49.811
Give me the serial number.

04:49.931 --> 04:52.251
The serial number is Hotel,

04:52.271 --> 04:53.342
Kilo,

04:53.571 --> 04:55.655
1, 2, 4.

04:56.133 --> 04:58.073
Ok, it's running.

04:58.193 --> 04:59.658
What's the festival?

05:00.156 --> 05:03.784
Celebrating local fishing.
I'm in Italy. I'm in Ostia.

05:04.119 --> 05:06.051
My uncle is a priest here.

05:06.060 --> 05:07.747
- A priest?
- Yeah.

05:07.981 --> 05:10.680
It's my father's brother.
Can you believe it?

05:11.273 --> 05:13.112
Bet they had some interesting discussions.

05:13.133 --> 05:15.080
Ah, well, you don't know the half of it.

05:15.093 --> 05:17.136
- Got a hit.
- What is it?

05:17.256 --> 05:19.137
Implanted two years ago.

05:19.148 --> 05:21.525
Juan Paolo of Teruel, Spain.

05:21.728 --> 05:23.008
Thanks, Sebastian.

05:23.445 --> 05:24.657
Sergeant Vittoria?

05:24.685 --> 05:27.257
We've got it: Juan Paolo, de Teruel, Spain.

05:27.266 --> 05:29.826
- Well, that was fast.
- Well, that's the way we do it.

05:29.836 --> 05:31.005
Grande.

05:35.195 --> 05:38.210
This is not the way I
envisioned our festival.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.428
Yeah, a body...

05:43.049 --> 05:46.714
I have done so many funerals
before, but this is...

05:46.717 --> 05:47.906
I know.

05:48.150 --> 05:50.020
This is different.

05:51.371 --> 05:54.680
- I've seen far too many.
- Come back with me.

05:54.704 --> 05:57.254
At least we can eat something together.

05:58.767 --> 06:00.742
I don't know, I'm not really hungry, Uncle.

06:00.750 --> 06:01.937
Eva...

06:01.958 --> 06:03.715
I don't see you enough.

06:04.010 --> 06:07.994
And I don't want this to be the
memory I have until the next time.

06:08.013 --> 06:10.432
I don't want it to be the memory either.

06:11.983 --> 06:14.543
Ok, let's have something to eat.

06:14.574 --> 06:17.354
But I need to go back soon
to the ICC, I can't be long.

06:17.358 --> 06:19.898
I'll take whatever time I can get.

06:20.376 --> 06:22.905
Earlier tonight in Ostia, Italy...

06:22.906 --> 06:25.257
a decomposed body washed ashore

06:25.280 --> 06:27.880
during the town's festival Di Antonio.

06:28.169 --> 06:29.713
Despite the decomposition...

06:29.744 --> 06:32.880
Italian police were able
to identify the body,

06:32.894 --> 06:36.907
as that of Juan Paolo of Teruel, Spain.

07:22.681 --> 07:23.942
Sergeant Vittoria.

07:24.449 --> 07:26.156
Have you checked the throat?

07:26.276 --> 07:27.514
Excuse me?

07:27.518 --> 07:29.588
The body that was pulled out of the water.

07:29.591 --> 07:31.257
Have you checked in the throat?

07:32.954 --> 07:34.428
Who is this?

07:35.474 --> 07:36.724
Hello?

07:36.844 --> 07:38.057
Hello?

08:09.080 --> 08:12.160
Synced and transcribed by chamallow
www.addic7ed.com

08:12.533 --> 08:13.685
A shell?

08:15.785 --> 08:17.942
That's what the medical examiner found...

08:17.980 --> 08:19.485
lodged in the throat.

08:19.605 --> 08:21.350
It's a bivalve mollusk.

08:22.150 --> 08:23.335
A scallop.

08:23.345 --> 08:25.752
They're very common in
the Mediterranean Sea.

08:25.872 --> 08:28.210
Well, this was placed there post-mortem.

08:29.147 --> 08:31.195
I'm going to assist on the investigation.

08:31.315 --> 08:32.855
I do agree, it's suspicious.

08:32.876 --> 08:35.830
But a single drowned body is
not exactly our jurisdiction.

08:35.852 --> 08:38.720
I know, Major, but this is a
town close to where I grew up.

08:38.738 --> 08:41.480
I know a lot of people there.
It's really personal for me.

08:41.501 --> 08:44.100
The question is, how the hell
this guy got Eva's number?

08:44.123 --> 08:45.599
That's the question to answer.

08:45.719 --> 08:47.330
The number was blocked.

08:47.450 --> 08:49.329
The call came from Tarragona,

08:49.330 --> 08:51.400
the landline registered to a Mateo Cruz.

08:51.409 --> 08:53.960
- He's a reporter?
- Barely.

08:53.980 --> 08:55.402
He writes the travel section

08:55.422 --> 08:58.400
for the "Noticias Nacionales",
a Tarragona newspaper.

08:58.520 --> 08:59.920
Could be how he got the number.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.800
Newspapers pay for access
to reverse directories.

09:02.819 --> 09:06.365
I will notify the Spanish authorities.
This is information they are going to need.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.419
- To be a suspect, Louis.
- Well, I can notify them from here too.

09:11.466 --> 09:14.666
This started in Italy, I'm
still an Italian sergeant, Major.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.847
I'm sorry, but I don't need
your permission to do this.

09:17.054 --> 09:20.440
Okay, but I'm sending Arabela
and Tommy to meet you there.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.000
- I don't need any help.
- It's not about need.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.715
This is team, Eva.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.671
All right, Sir.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.800
—

10:05.250 --> 10:06.550
Who are you?

10:06.670 --> 10:08.350
What's going on?

10:09.898 --> 10:11.300
Inspector Jefe, what's this?

10:11.320 --> 10:13.430
- Are you Mateo Cruz?
- Yes.

10:13.434 --> 10:15.141
Well, you're under arrest.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.399
What for?

10:16.400 --> 10:19.602
- Suspicion of murder.
- I... I didn't kill anyone.

10:19.640 --> 10:22.000
Then how do you know about the
shell in the victim's throat?

10:22.028 --> 10:24.500
Ladies, you're gonna want to see this.

10:26.775 --> 10:28.370
Jackpot, mate.

10:28.401 --> 10:31.140
Please, just let me explain.

10:31.175 --> 10:35.480
You can explain this to Inspector Campo
when he gets you back to the police station.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.368
- Let's go have a chat, Mateo. Come...
- I already told him.

10:38.488 --> 10:40.840
- What?
- I already told him everything.

10:46.122 --> 10:48.622
- Did you?
- They won't listen.

10:48.742 --> 10:50.369
That's why I called you.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.150
Maybe you could help.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.602
- Help? With what?
- This, the case.

10:55.722 --> 10:58.900
- Someone's killing young men.
- By the looks of it, you are, mate.

10:58.960 --> 10:59.830
Let him talk.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.350
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

11:01.383 --> 11:03.550
Well, it won't hurt to
listen for five minutes.

11:03.811 --> 11:05.549
Tell us. Talk, please.

11:05.550 --> 11:06.550
Ok.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.900
Last year, when I was in San Sebastián...

11:09.000 --> 11:10.900
I heard about a few missing tourists.

11:10.934 --> 11:13.499
Then, when I work the
assignment in Tarragona...

11:13.500 --> 11:15.440
I found out there were a few more.

11:15.450 --> 11:18.100
People there talk about
it like it was a legend...

11:18.250 --> 11:19.950
but I decided to look into it.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.889
When the men were found at different
places along the Mediterranean...

11:23.900 --> 11:26.622
I was able to get a hold of the autopsies.

11:26.960 --> 11:31.153
They were all classified as
accidental. So, it wasn't hard.

11:31.509 --> 11:34.850
And that's when I noticed the
shells being found in the throats.

11:35.096 --> 11:37.500
And... and no one found this suspicious?

11:37.788 --> 11:39.220
Por favor,

11:39.340 --> 11:42.670
more than 1500 people a year
drown in the Mediterranean.

11:42.675 --> 11:47.040
Finding shells or other sea creatures
on the body, is not exactly uncommon.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.650
Oh yes, but the fact
it was the same shell...

11:50.750 --> 11:52.053
can be curious.

11:52.173 --> 11:54.034
So I took the information to my boss,

11:54.054 --> 11:55.934
who told me that it wasn't my job.

11:55.960 --> 11:59.650
Then, I went to the police, who
told me they'd look into it...

11:59.673 --> 12:00.933
but I could tell,

12:01.053 --> 12:04.743
they looked at me like
some... conspiracy theorist.

12:04.863 --> 12:06.166
And then yesterday,

12:06.186 --> 12:08.787
I saw the body of Juan
Paolo found in Italy.

12:08.907 --> 12:10.352
And you saw me.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.250
Yeah.

12:12.450 --> 12:15.849
I did a story on your team a few
months ago, a gambling scandal.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.320
- That wasn't true.
- I'm sure it wasn't.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.974
But I did some research,

12:19.975 --> 12:23.043
and you guys are able to
resolve amazing things.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.712
So I thought maybe... you could help.

12:28.950 --> 12:30.329
What do you think?

12:32.128 --> 12:34.170
This is all speculations.

12:34.496 --> 12:38.200
Technically, there's no evidence
that homicides have been committed.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.300
And you?

12:40.460 --> 12:42.950
There's almost a dozen missing persons...

12:43.346 --> 12:47.600
if he's telling the truth, then we have
a prolific serial killer on our hands.

12:50.378 --> 12:54.117
- Get him dressed. I need him to come with us.
- No.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.649
- Senora, that's not possible.
- Why not?

12:56.650 --> 12:59.000
This man has cost an
investigation to be started.

12:59.035 --> 13:00.773
Of course you can talk
to him from his cell,

13:00.793 --> 13:02.840
- at the Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, ok?
- Perfect, then.

13:02.856 --> 13:04.776
I did not do anything.

13:04.796 --> 13:06.310
- I'm gonna go with him.
- Eva...

13:06.320 --> 13:08.271
We can't ignore this.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.348
Eva, are you sure his alibi stands up?

13:16.360 --> 13:19.863
Well, of the six abductions
we can connect to this case,

13:19.880 --> 13:23.003
travel records show he wasn't
even in Spain for three of them.

13:23.040 --> 13:26.519
And in the other three cases,
he was at home in Tarragona.

13:26.732 --> 13:29.000
- I believe him, Major.
- It's not enough of a reason.

13:29.019 --> 13:30.463
That's not completely true.

13:30.483 --> 13:32.014
I really believe he just stumbled on it.

13:32.038 --> 13:34.680
And anyway, there's no
evidence to hold him here, so...

13:34.800 --> 13:36.661
the Spanish police's gonna let him go.

13:36.682 --> 13:39.466
At the moment, whether he did it or not,

13:39.486 --> 13:41.518
is not the concern, Eva.

13:41.550 --> 13:45.649
You all know that the team has to
be invited in on an investigation.

13:45.664 --> 13:48.300
Is there even an
investigation ongoing here?

13:48.306 --> 13:50.114
But, sir, if he is right,

13:50.134 --> 13:52.227
we at least owe it to the
victims to look into it.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.976
I'm with Dorn. This is just some nut
job with too much time on his hands.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.759
If we can prove something is going on,

13:57.760 --> 13:59.439
we will bring it into the Court.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.189
You're going to look into it.

14:01.483 --> 14:05.761
- Yes, absolutely.
- I grant the team a modicum of latitude, Louis.

14:05.881 --> 14:08.148
But until there's actual evidence,

14:08.268 --> 14:10.280
it will be a very sort leash.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.480
- All right?
- Ok.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.882
Hickman.

14:14.589 --> 14:18.280
Ok, Eva. This is your show
now. But as Dorn said...

14:18.308 --> 14:22.118
you need to watch our boundaries
until we can get sufficient evidence.

14:22.150 --> 14:23.896
- Yes, sir.
- You can use my villa.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.071
I've got all the information there.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.185
It's not a bad idea.

14:28.906 --> 14:31.803
Yeah. Contact me when you get there.

14:31.923 --> 14:33.750
- And Eva?
- Yes, Major?

14:34.211 --> 14:37.025
- Don't make me regret this.
- I won't.

14:39.982 --> 14:43.160
You're really gonna let a member
of the press in on an investigation?

14:43.172 --> 14:45.499
He's done months of work on this.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.200
Could be an asset to us.

14:47.800 --> 14:48.800
And?

14:49.004 --> 14:51.760
And after Sebastian's
problem in the news...

14:51.798 --> 14:54.800
it would not hurt this team
to get a little good press.

14:58.650 --> 15:00.028
- It's your call.
- Yes.

15:00.050 --> 15:01.826
But in my dealings with them...

15:02.334 --> 15:04.350
journalists are not to be trusted.

15:06.236 --> 15:08.817
Especially when they
come with good intentions.

15:15.990 --> 15:17.800
Thank you for doing this.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.359
It's not for you, it's for them.

15:20.479 --> 15:22.880
I just meant, thank you for believing me.

15:22.908 --> 15:24.200
Eva believes you.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.216
I'm operating on a very
thinly veiled suspicion.

15:28.263 --> 15:30.173
Ok, so...

15:31.524 --> 15:33.000
where do we start?

15:33.343 --> 15:36.747
These are drownings, I'd
say, we start in the water.

16:05.929 --> 16:09.280
All right, I've got all the
information digitized to you.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.615
Ok, Sebastian, it's not about
where the bodies were found,

16:12.630 --> 16:14.515
but where they went into the water.

16:14.635 --> 16:16.200
All right.

16:16.320 --> 16:21.041
I'll take where each body was found
along points in the Mediterranean...

16:21.257 --> 16:23.980
calculate the estimated time of death,

16:24.240 --> 16:27.872
and chart current patterns along the water.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.980
I can get it down to a
stretch of Spanish coastline...

16:31.100 --> 16:33.200
between Valencia and Barcelona.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.750
That's 350 kms.

16:35.960 --> 16:39.527
There's way too many variables
to get it exact: marine life,

16:39.560 --> 16:42.900
- boat activity...
- Well, it's a start.

16:44.079 --> 16:45.129
Seeger.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.381
This is Doctor De Luca
from the Ostia morgue.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.430
Yes?

16:48.550 --> 16:51.963
I just concluded the autopsy
from the victim of last night.

16:52.083 --> 16:54.025
There seems to be something...

16:54.145 --> 16:55.260
...odd.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.793
More odd than the shell being
found stuffed in her throat?

16:57.800 --> 17:00.530
Not odd like that, "curious"
would be a better word.

17:00.535 --> 17:03.960
Although the body was soaked with
salt water from the Mediterranean...

17:03.997 --> 17:07.040
I found a trace amount of
fresh water in her lungs.

17:07.076 --> 17:09.169
So, he was drowned somewhere else?

17:09.200 --> 17:11.740
- That would be my finding, yes.
- Ok.

17:12.166 --> 17:13.550
Thank you, Doctor.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.342
Fresh water was found in the lungs.

17:16.359 --> 17:19.726
Which means the killer could have
drowned them anywhere inland, and then...

17:19.846 --> 17:22.074
dumped them in the Mediterranean.

17:22.094 --> 17:24.349
There's more than 1800 rivers in Spain.

17:24.470 --> 17:27.154
That just made this a
little more difficult.

17:29.300 --> 17:30.300
Louis.

17:30.689 --> 17:35.450
The Court has authorized further
investigation as long as the Spanish approve.

17:35.570 --> 17:37.832
Thanks, Dorn. But you could have called.

17:38.219 --> 17:41.226
You're using a journalist as the source.

17:41.968 --> 17:45.400
- I believe he can be helpful.
- He's a journalist.

17:45.737 --> 17:48.511
We can't afford any more bad press, Louis.

17:50.164 --> 17:51.300
I know.

17:55.493 --> 17:58.836
The Ostia morgue are running tests
on the water found in the lungs.

17:58.867 --> 18:01.336
They're trying to pinpoint the
lake or river it may have come from.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.028
I wouldn't hold my breath
though, no pun intended.

18:04.050 --> 18:08.193
Dorn was able to get authorization
as long as we get Spanish approval.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.677
That's not gonna be easy.

18:09.700 --> 18:12.177
Well, I'm kinda doubting how
much the water will give us.

18:12.297 --> 18:14.200
We should start looking at victimology.

18:14.574 --> 18:16.400
I could run backgrounds on the victims.

18:16.410 --> 18:17.816
- Yeah.
- I've done that already.

18:17.850 --> 18:20.112
Most of them were here alone on holiday.

18:20.150 --> 18:21.839
Backpackers hiking across Europe.

18:21.869 --> 18:24.160
But that's where the
connection seemingly stopped.

18:24.280 --> 18:27.977
Sebastian can run a more
thorough search. Until then...

18:29.064 --> 18:31.919
Maybe it's not the people, but the places.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.439
According to Mateo's research,

18:34.459 --> 18:37.263
two most frequent abduction sites
is Saint-Jean Pied de Port in France,

18:37.294 --> 18:39.000
and Roncesvalles in Spain.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.134
Wait for the lab results on the water,

18:41.144 --> 18:43.197
see why these places were chosen.

18:43.210 --> 18:45.361
You guys check out Roncesvalles,

18:45.381 --> 18:47.890
Hickman and Sebastian will go to France.

18:47.891 --> 18:51.350
And we'll meet you in
Tarragona when I can. Ok?

19:07.772 --> 19:11.460
I can tell why you wanna spend
holiday here, it's so beautiful.

19:11.725 --> 19:14.550
Not quite as beautiful as
you, but it has its moments.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.013
Seriously?

19:16.318 --> 19:17.400
What?

19:17.415 --> 19:20.476
Let's keep it in our pants, mate. We're
on this wild goose chase 'cause of you.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.672
Goose chase?

19:21.896 --> 19:23.050
Never mind.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.442
I've been here many times.

19:25.706 --> 19:29.354
- Perks of being a travel journalist.
- Blogger.

19:30.583 --> 19:32.450
Roncesvalles has a rich history.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.266
This is where Charlemagne
was defeated in 778,

19:35.297 --> 19:37.908
in the Battle of Roncevaux Pass.

19:38.028 --> 19:40.062
La morte di Rolando.

19:41.698 --> 19:44.716
Nothing's more attractive
in a woman than intelligence.

19:46.749 --> 19:48.181
What the hell, Tommy?

19:48.196 --> 19:50.146
Look, while you two are making
goo-goo eyes at each other,

19:50.147 --> 19:51.925
I've got my eyes on this case.

19:51.950 --> 19:55.227
- What is that supposed to mean?
- That.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.887
So this the same kind of shell
found in our bloke's throat?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.005
Yeah.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.095
Of course.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.480
How could I not have seen it?

20:17.500 --> 20:18.892
Do you have any idea what
they're talking about?

20:18.903 --> 20:21.130
- Hi, any use?
- Eva?

20:21.250 --> 20:23.251
No we haven't found anything yet.

20:23.485 --> 20:24.958
We may have.

20:25.078 --> 20:26.391
Look around you.

20:26.402 --> 20:29.282
Do you see any scallop
shells on rocks or anything?

20:29.320 --> 20:32.107
Now that you mention it, we're at the
last place one of the victim's was seen.

20:32.128 --> 20:34.312
And, we're looking at
the shell logo right now.

20:34.432 --> 20:37.533
- And they're everywhere in the city.
- Right.

20:38.102 --> 20:39.586
Meet us in Spain.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.339
I might know how he's choosing his victims.

20:46.326 --> 20:48.663
You guys are gonna fill us
in on your little secret?

20:49.415 --> 20:52.707
He might be picking off his
victims on the way of Saint James.

20:52.827 --> 20:55.229
- Camino de Santiago.
- Yeah, Santiago de Compostela.

20:55.349 --> 20:56.349
Yeah.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.399
I know the place.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.867
My father used to take me on the
pilgrimage there when I was a little girl.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.706
Yeah, its two most popular starting points

21:02.716 --> 21:05.280
are in Saint-Jean Pied
de Port and Roncesvalles.

21:05.307 --> 21:09.188
You know, the logo for the trip is the
scallop shell stuck in the victims' throat.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.085
So basically, we're looking for a religious
nut along the road filled with religious people?

21:13.120 --> 21:16.080
Like looking for a specific
needle among a stack of needles.

21:16.114 --> 21:18.130
And the way's thousands of kilometers long.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.087
If he's sticking to a pattern...

21:20.463 --> 21:22.450
he's already looking for the next victim.

21:23.336 --> 21:25.734
And no way to narrow
where he's gonna go next.

21:42.679 --> 21:45.291
I'm sorry, that's... all I have.

21:45.778 --> 21:48.298
I wasn't exactly expecting company.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.102
Well, I had it worse I guess.

21:51.722 --> 21:52.850
Thank you.

21:54.812 --> 21:58.520
Well, make yourself... at home. Please.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.896
Which one do you know?

22:07.413 --> 22:08.744
Excuse me?

22:10.329 --> 22:12.960
This is not just about a story, is it?

22:13.173 --> 22:14.901
You're too invested.

22:20.602 --> 22:22.552
I just want justice.

22:29.403 --> 22:30.700
My brother.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.461
Oscar.

22:33.121 --> 22:35.874
- I'm... I'm sorry, Mateo, I...
- No, no, please, don't.

22:35.994 --> 22:37.500
Don't be.

22:38.160 --> 22:40.772
We... really lost him a long time ago.

22:41.473 --> 22:42.865
Drugs.

22:44.769 --> 22:49.372
I hadn't talked to him in years, until
he called me from Le Buis, in France.

22:50.459 --> 22:52.653
He told me he'd found a new way.

22:53.121 --> 22:55.509
I didn't know he meant, "The Way".

22:58.069 --> 23:00.803
Then the Sicilian police called.

23:01.026 --> 23:03.211
Told me he'd drowned.

23:04.718 --> 23:07.045
And that's when you started investigating?

23:08.792 --> 23:10.886
I've never really been there for him.

23:11.332 --> 23:14.838
It was an embarrassment for me, the family.

23:15.549 --> 23:18.262
He was sick, and we did nothing.

23:20.866 --> 23:23.091
I know the pain of losing your family.

23:25.002 --> 23:26.627
And the feeling..

23:27.934 --> 23:29.580
helpless.

23:34.667 --> 23:37.024
Both of my parents were murdered.

23:39.321 --> 23:41.546
It's why I do what I do.

23:43.974 --> 23:45.762
That was the Ostia morgue.

23:45.783 --> 23:49.350
They were not able to find
anything in the trace water sample.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.380
If we can't figure out why this
guy's drowning his victims, then...

23:52.388 --> 23:54.080
What if we are looking at it wrong?

23:54.115 --> 23:56.980
There were trace amounts of
fresh water in the lungs, but...

23:57.100 --> 24:00.973
the body had been in the heavily
salted Mediterranean, for what, days?

24:01.258 --> 24:03.869
What if the body wasn't
dumped into the sea?

24:04.144 --> 24:06.150
But rather floated into it.

24:06.186 --> 24:08.530
Know how many rivers
flow in the Mediterranean?

24:08.554 --> 24:10.200
Not as many as you'd think.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.619
Three main ones are Po, Rhône and Ebro.

24:12.650 --> 24:16.043
Ebro's in Spain, but it's almost
a thousand kilometers long.

24:16.250 --> 24:18.379
Inspector Chief Campo, por favor.

24:19.071 --> 24:22.292
- What are you thinking about?
- If he's sticking to a pattern...

24:22.320 --> 24:26.397
maybe there's a body floating
towards the Mediterranean as we speak.

24:26.925 --> 24:30.320
Yes. This is Major Daniel from the ICC.

24:30.980 --> 24:33.580
I assume you received our authorization...

24:33.700 --> 24:35.461
from the Criminal Court.

24:35.750 --> 24:38.509
And then we need a favor
of you, and your men.

24:39.260 --> 24:42.200
Near Tortosa, Spain

24:44.881 --> 24:46.480
Buenos días.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.899
Inspector Campo, how are you?

24:47.929 --> 24:49.524
- Fine, thanks. You?
- Good, good.

24:49.550 --> 24:50.946
My men found a body.

24:50.976 --> 24:53.080
How can we be sure this is even connected?

24:53.200 --> 24:55.108
- Excuse me, can I borrow your tweezers?
- Of course.

24:55.132 --> 24:56.534
Gracias.

24:56.799 --> 24:58.800
Can you please follow me?

25:12.945 --> 25:14.795
Does this answer your question?

25:16.532 --> 25:19.580
We will transport the body
to the morgue, in Zaragoza.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.703
It's the first time we have a fresh body.

25:21.823 --> 25:24.080
There could be clues that
washed away with the others.

25:24.096 --> 25:26.179
I will tell Eva to go to the morgue.

25:26.299 --> 25:29.197
- I'll meet her there.
- I will too.

25:29.481 --> 25:31.609
Never heard you volunteer for a morgue run.

25:31.610 --> 25:33.199
I just don't trust that tosser.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.994
He's been all over Eva
since we took the case.

25:36.400 --> 25:39.063
You're worried that he's bothering
her, or that's it's working?

25:46.364 --> 25:48.467
The church of San Bartolomé.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.865
It's beautiful.

25:51.389 --> 25:54.560
Bartolomé was one of
the apostles of Christ.

25:54.569 --> 25:56.825
He even witnessed the Ascensión.

25:57.905 --> 26:00.973
This is landmark number
9 on this map I have.

26:01.939 --> 26:03.666
You're doing the Camino too?

26:04.500 --> 26:07.242
- It's my twentieth time.
- Wow.

26:07.720 --> 26:09.081
Yeah, it's...

26:09.524 --> 26:13.840
My mother used to take us in it
every summer when I was a boy.

26:13.960 --> 26:17.145
- Lucky you.
- Yeah, lucky.

26:19.462 --> 26:21.118
Are you Catholic?

26:21.423 --> 26:22.900
Not really religious.

26:23.020 --> 26:26.433
I'm taking a cultural studies
class at my university, and...

26:26.450 --> 26:29.268
this seemed like a pretty
ace way to spend my summer.

26:31.239 --> 26:33.596
- I'm Pedro.
- Walter.

26:34.247 --> 26:36.523
Well, since this is your first time,

26:37.041 --> 26:40.515
you must let me buy you a drink
in this great tavern in town.

26:40.635 --> 26:43.180
Well, it has been a long walk.

26:43.300 --> 26:45.931
- Why not?
- Great.

26:52.845 --> 26:56.055
I've never actually waited
for an autopsy before.

26:56.175 --> 26:57.753
Are they usually this long?

26:57.966 --> 26:59.958
I'm sure they can take longer.

27:01.410 --> 27:04.550
If it wasn't for you, Campo
wouldn't have ordered it immediately.

27:04.670 --> 27:08.218
- Lucky you met me then.
- Not so lucky for the dead bloke.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.758
I didn't mean...

27:12.291 --> 27:13.900
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

27:18.272 --> 27:20.029
I'm pretty hungry too.

27:20.050 --> 27:21.601
- Would you like anything?
- No, thanks.

27:21.625 --> 27:24.449
- I'll wait here.
- Ok.

27:29.350 --> 27:30.414
Hey.

27:30.922 --> 27:32.000
Hey.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.677
Listen, I just want you to
know we are on the same team.

27:36.541 --> 27:38.680
- What team is that, mate?
- Justice.

27:38.800 --> 27:39.965
Really?

27:40.371 --> 27:43.080
This isn't just about you getting
a good story for your paper?

27:43.094 --> 27:44.903
Maybe you just like the scenery.

27:45.127 --> 27:46.427
Do you mean Eva?

27:47.129 --> 27:49.978
If there is something going on
between you two... I didn't know.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.080
Just because I don't like you,
doesn't mean I'm interested in Eva.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.450
That's good to know.

27:54.755 --> 27:56.319
They found something.

28:00.688 --> 28:05.430
In the initial examination, I was able to
locate a puncture wound on the victim's neck.

28:05.454 --> 28:07.201
Well, drowning someone isn't easy.

28:07.232 --> 28:09.350
- He's probably drugging them.
- Exactly.

28:09.470 --> 28:11.530
So we ran a toxicology screen...

28:11.550 --> 28:15.330
and we were able to find a massive
amount of ketamine in his system.

28:15.450 --> 28:17.657
Ketamine, like the horse drug?

28:20.806 --> 28:23.569
Damn, I wanted to be in Burgos by now.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.800
Since it's my fault you're behind,
why don't you let me give you a lift.

28:26.832 --> 28:29.341
You're driving? Isn't that cheating?

28:29.360 --> 28:31.302
I said it was my twentieth time.

28:31.330 --> 28:32.745
I've earned the right to cheat.

28:32.750 --> 28:34.848
But I won't tell on you.

28:35.773 --> 28:37.988
You know, why the hell not?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.492
This is my car.

28:39.850 --> 28:41.859
It's open, get in.

29:01.970 --> 29:04.380
- Ketamine?
- It's a horse tranquilizer mostly.

29:04.415 --> 29:07.005
- It's also a narcotic.
- And this guy's injecting it.

29:07.040 --> 29:10.307
Well, if it's so easy for him to
have access to injectable ketamine,

29:10.327 --> 29:13.812
- he might be a vet.
- Or works around one. A tech or a receptionist.

29:13.850 --> 29:15.022
Sebastian?

29:15.387 --> 29:18.000
There's a lot. I need
something to narrow it down.

29:18.008 --> 29:20.904
- Do you have any reports of missing ketamine?
- No.

29:21.158 --> 29:23.559
Veterinarians aren't regulated
like doctors or hospitals.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.691
A vet can basically
order as much as he wants.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.906
What about a spike in ketamine orders?

29:28.800 --> 29:30.721
Mateo, in your estimation...

29:30.841 --> 29:32.950
When was the first murder committed?

29:32.966 --> 29:34.399
About a year ago.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.870
There are three veterinarians in the area.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.480
In Alagón, Estella and Tafalla.

29:39.499 --> 29:41.897
We're about 20 minutes outside of Alagón.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.198
We will take the other two.

29:43.220 --> 29:45.920
- What's the office address?
- It's not an office.

29:45.942 --> 29:48.939
It's a residential address. A farmhouse.

29:49.294 --> 29:50.839
Ok, let's go.

29:59.994 --> 30:01.200
What...

30:02.605 --> 30:04.058
You're safe.

30:04.178 --> 30:07.859
- Then why am I tied up?
- I have to get my mother.

30:08.763 --> 30:10.938
She's gonna be here really soon.

30:12.212 --> 30:14.544
She just likes to see the people I baptize.

30:14.664 --> 30:15.900
Baptize?

30:16.020 --> 30:20.723
- Every sinner needs to be absolved.
- I'm not... I didn't sin.

30:22.566 --> 30:25.117
I seem to remember you said
you weren't very religious.

30:25.150 --> 30:27.058
That doesn't mean I'm a sinner.

30:28.552 --> 30:29.552
Yes.

30:31.316 --> 30:33.246
Yes it does.

30:43.630 --> 30:45.012
Ok, copy.

30:46.902 --> 30:49.736
They did not find anything in Estella.

30:51.074 --> 30:53.279
There's a truck in the
driveway and some lights are on.

30:53.300 --> 30:54.630
Someone's home.

30:54.750 --> 30:57.120
- Shall we wait for the others?
- They're still miles away.

30:57.150 --> 30:59.325
We can handle a suspect interview with...

30:59.350 --> 31:00.849
Doctor Javier Almora.

31:00.969 --> 31:02.079
He's 60.

31:02.109 --> 31:04.600
- Hey, a 60 year-old veterinarian.
- What's the plan?

31:05.879 --> 31:07.970
- The plan?
- Yeah.

31:08.090 --> 31:10.339
The plan is we're gonna go
and interview this suspect,

31:10.459 --> 31:12.219
and you're gonna wait in the car. Here,

31:12.250 --> 31:15.033
- crack a window if it gets stuffy.
- No, wait.

31:15.153 --> 31:17.238
You cannot just cut me out now.

31:17.250 --> 31:18.701
What if this is the guy?

31:20.990 --> 31:23.388
Probably this is not the guy, Mateo.

31:23.508 --> 31:26.100
And if he is, it's better
for you to wait here anyway.

31:26.130 --> 31:28.430
- But...
- You're not a cop, I'm sorry.

31:28.550 --> 31:30.698
You've got to wait here, ok?

31:37.845 --> 31:39.836
So, what's your problem with him?

31:39.956 --> 31:42.183
Who, Don Juan back there?

31:42.303 --> 31:45.276
If you give him a chance, you
might find he's not that different.

31:45.310 --> 31:48.365
Really? I'm a cop, he's a cop groupie...

31:48.400 --> 31:51.423
trying to get involved in a murder
he should have nothing to do with.

31:51.758 --> 31:54.349
His brother was one of the victims.

32:05.719 --> 32:06.830
Help!

32:06.950 --> 32:08.188
Help!

32:08.400 --> 32:10.150
Help!

32:10.423 --> 32:11.693
Help!

32:11.950 --> 32:13.583
Help!

32:25.504 --> 32:28.136
- Maybe no one's home.
- Maybe.

32:56.225 --> 32:57.530
May I help you?

32:57.546 --> 33:00.000
Hello sir, we are from the ICC.

33:00.025 --> 33:02.271
- ICC?
- We're police officers.

33:02.535 --> 33:05.471
We're looking for Doctor,
uh... Javier Almora.

33:05.481 --> 33:07.680
- Is he home?
- My father?

33:07.800 --> 33:10.389
- No, not.. not... not right now.
- When will he be back?

33:10.409 --> 33:13.143
We have a few questions we'd want
to ask him about his vet business.

33:13.150 --> 33:14.380
I don't know.

33:14.383 --> 33:15.704
Well, can we come in and wait for him?

33:15.724 --> 33:17.705
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

33:18.300 --> 33:19.839
My mother...

33:20.189 --> 33:22.852
she doesn't like people in her house.

33:26.936 --> 33:30.432
- But I could ask her.
- Yes, please, that's a good idea.

33:31.173 --> 33:34.221
Mama? Wait here.

33:50.402 --> 33:53.146
- Wait a minute.
- What is it?

34:03.002 --> 34:04.607
- Ready?
- Yeah.

34:10.388 --> 34:11.690
Eva...

34:22.795 --> 34:24.187
Eva?

34:29.168 --> 34:31.219
Eva, can you hear me? Eva...

34:31.550 --> 34:32.601
Eva...

34:36.446 --> 34:37.635
Eva!

34:38.610 --> 34:39.789
Eva!

34:40.286 --> 34:41.598
Eva!

35:01.197 --> 35:05.057
You, on the bed! On your feet, up! Up!

35:07.688 --> 35:10.630
I got a body. I got a dead body!

35:10.868 --> 35:12.118
Tommy!

35:13.810 --> 35:15.046
Tommy!

35:15.890 --> 35:17.780
Tommy, come here!

35:19.613 --> 35:21.036
Eva!

35:22.753 --> 35:24.267
Tommy!

35:25.233 --> 35:26.421
Eva!

35:26.696 --> 35:27.813
Eva!

35:28.017 --> 35:29.561
I'm here!

35:32.260 --> 35:33.713
Where is he?

35:33.833 --> 35:37.939
- It's clear. He's gone.
- I found the father.

35:38.059 --> 35:40.389
- Alive?
- Not for a long time.

35:40.509 --> 35:41.842
Shit.

35:55.298 --> 35:56.832
Let's get the car.

36:00.250 --> 36:02.725
- Where's Mateo?
- He must have taken him.

36:02.729 --> 36:04.538
And he's got the key!

36:06.163 --> 36:08.200
Don't you see I'm saving souls?

36:08.220 --> 36:10.715
How dare you interfere?

36:16.043 --> 36:18.230
There's no sign of them on the road.

36:18.268 --> 36:21.133
I have my men searching the Ebro river.

36:22.700 --> 36:24.435
We will find him, Eva.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.148
After he's already been drowned...

36:27.169 --> 36:28.786
- Eva...
- We told him to stay in the car.

36:28.810 --> 36:31.570
- So what, this is our fault now?
- It's not our fault, but we shouldn't have left him behind.

36:31.578 --> 36:34.332
Look, something in this house
is gonna tell us where he is.

36:43.456 --> 36:45.560
Here, take a look.

36:59.900 --> 37:01.252
That's odd.

37:01.627 --> 37:04.127
What? Aside from the fact we
just rolled a guy out of here

37:04.137 --> 37:06.464
drugged to the eyeballs, destined to drown.

37:06.470 --> 37:07.887
No, this.

37:08.750 --> 37:10.518
That's not original.

37:14.430 --> 37:16.869
It's some kind of home-improvement.

37:17.448 --> 37:18.500
What?

37:19.557 --> 37:21.213
Like a secret room?

37:22.097 --> 37:23.611
Yeah, maybe.

37:33.182 --> 37:35.936
You've definitely watched
too many horror movies.

37:42.145 --> 37:45.478
- Can you smell that?
- Yeah, come on.

38:09.706 --> 38:10.750
Is she...

38:10.870 --> 38:13.463
Dead? Yeah, I think, yeah.

38:16.429 --> 38:19.070
- This must be Mommy.
- Hickman...

38:19.071 --> 38:20.666
- Yeah?
- Look.

38:29.947 --> 38:31.684
She's baptizing him.

38:32.730 --> 38:36.350
They're not able to positively
identify him as Javier Almora.

38:36.470 --> 38:38.690
He's been deceased for close to a year.

38:38.810 --> 38:40.689
That's when the drownings started.

38:40.690 --> 38:43.650
Son's name is Pedro Almora.
By not reporting him dead

38:43.660 --> 38:47.370
he's been able to keep his veterinarian
credentials, and keep ordering the ketamine.

38:47.650 --> 38:50.346
Wait, when he wouldn't let us in the
house, he said something about his mother.

38:50.370 --> 38:51.630
Yeah, well...

38:51.750 --> 38:53.263
There's nobody there.

38:59.884 --> 39:02.840
Just found the mother in the
basement, and it ain't pretty.

39:03.166 --> 39:06.032
I'm thinking her and dad
died roughly at the same time.

39:06.070 --> 39:08.581
So what? Parricide?

39:08.600 --> 39:10.887
Maybe. And then we saw this.

39:10.900 --> 39:13.130
We're thinking it's some kind of baptism.

39:13.153 --> 39:14.636
It's starting to make sense.

39:14.650 --> 39:16.330
Religious pilgrimage? Drowning?

39:16.363 --> 39:17.930
So he's baptizing them?

39:17.954 --> 39:20.393
Yeah, and he looks none too
happy about his own in this photo,

39:20.403 --> 39:22.435
which makes me think it
was a common occurrence.

39:22.450 --> 39:24.130
- Can I take a look?
- Yeah.

39:24.250 --> 39:25.890
The mother forced him to do it.

39:25.923 --> 39:27.915
And now he's continuing her legacy.

39:29.174 --> 39:30.790
I know this place.

39:52.202 --> 39:53.650
I don't know who you are...

39:54.813 --> 39:57.028
but I'm sure you're a sinner.

39:57.968 --> 40:01.321
My mother says... everyone is.

40:02.408 --> 40:04.969
The only way to get rid of it...

40:05.635 --> 40:08.419
is by baptism, you know?

40:15.962 --> 40:17.669
So be happy.

40:29.492 --> 40:31.180
Beloved in the Lord,

40:31.300 --> 40:34.796
when the Saviour sent out his
apostles, he said unto them,

40:34.916 --> 40:37.647
"Go ye, and teach all nations:

40:37.650 --> 40:41.210
teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I have planned for you.

40:42.078 --> 40:46.631
He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved.

40:47.194 --> 40:49.907
Do you accept the Lord as your saviour?

40:53.413 --> 40:56.880
♪♪♪ with ♪♪♪ permission, I baptize thee

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
in the name of the Father!

41:01.373 --> 41:03.090
Of the Son!

41:09.309 --> 41:12.936
And of the Holy... Holy Ghost!

41:14.610 --> 41:16.250
Stop!

41:16.350 --> 41:18.827
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

41:26.350 --> 41:27.350
Mateo!

41:52.700 --> 41:53.850
Breathe!

41:57.385 --> 41:59.200
You're all right, mate, you're all right.

42:19.964 --> 42:21.700
Shouldn't you be resting?

42:24.201 --> 42:26.152
I hate hospitals.

42:27.523 --> 42:30.610
Anyway, I've got a hell
of a story to write.

42:30.730 --> 42:32.726
Well, you did right by Oscar.

42:33.365 --> 42:34.550
Maybe.

42:35.966 --> 42:37.400
Listen...

42:37.613 --> 42:40.610
near-death experiences make me hungry.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.398
You want to grab something?

42:42.815 --> 42:43.900
I'm buying.

42:43.932 --> 42:45.609
The least I could do.

42:47.967 --> 42:50.385
Not like... not like a date.

42:50.405 --> 42:52.072
Unless you want it to be.

42:52.387 --> 42:54.134
- If not...
- I do.

42:56.210 --> 42:57.509
Ok.

42:58.768 --> 43:00.496
Don't you have to tell
them that you're leaving?

43:00.520 --> 43:01.689
You kidding?

43:01.690 --> 43:03.879
They might make me stay.

43:04.386 --> 43:07.182
Oh, then I'm gonna take you
to a very nice restaurant.

43:07.527 --> 43:08.726
Oh yeah?

43:09.152 --> 43:12.068
It's a place where my father used
to take me when I was a child.

43:12.070 --> 43:15.279
- They make a very good "pinchitos" there.
- Ok.

43:15.300 --> 43:16.672
Surprise me.

43:17.170 --> 43:18.532
I will.
