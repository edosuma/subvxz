09:01.390 --> 09:02.090
-Yes.

09:02.090 --> 09:03.890
I'm Tammy's ex-stepdaughter.

09:03.890 --> 09:05.250
-Oh!

09:05.250 --> 09:07.880
-Who are you?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.440
-Josh, this is my house.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.390
I lived here.

09:10.390 --> 09:11.470
I grew up here at least.

09:11.470 --> 09:12.260
This is Kristin.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.240
She's from Sotheby's.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.100
-Hi, Kristin from Sotheby's.

09:15.100 --> 09:17.440
-So if you're
Sarah's brother, that

09:17.440 --> 09:19.060
means you could be
my uncle one day.

09:19.060 --> 09:20.980
Wouldn't that be fun?

09:20.980 --> 09:23.980
-Um, I have to think about that.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.460
-Hey, Uncle.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.690
-OK, you want to
show me the interior?

09:27.690 --> 09:28.570
-Sure, OK.

09:28.570 --> 09:29.570
-I'll catch up with you later.

09:37.540 --> 09:39.430
-Namaste.

09:39.430 --> 09:41.000
-Hey, girl, hey.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.120
-Oh, I can't hear you.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.660
Namaste!

09:44.660 --> 09:46.990
-Hey, girl, hey.

09:46.990 --> 09:50.570
-OK, everyone take
a plank position.

09:50.570 --> 09:51.270
Good.

09:51.270 --> 09:52.390
Plank position.

09:52.390 --> 09:53.670
That's right.

09:53.670 --> 09:56.810
We're going to
have some fun now.

09:56.810 --> 09:58.640
Uh-oh.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.480
OK, no injuries today.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.200
-I'm sorry.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.810
I took some medication
this morning

10:03.810 --> 10:05.440
and I'm feeling kind of floaty.

10:05.440 --> 10:06.850
-OK, no problem.

10:06.850 --> 10:08.030
Put your head down.

10:08.030 --> 10:09.770
We're going to hang out
in child's pose for now.

10:09.770 --> 10:12.180
Head down, bottom up.

10:12.180 --> 10:13.160
Good girl.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.690
Just continue to
practise at home,

10:14.690 --> 10:16.660
and build on that core strength.

10:16.660 --> 10:17.840
That's key.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.240
-Since I've been
on that Premarin,

10:19.240 --> 10:23.870
I've had totally different
reaction in my body.

10:23.870 --> 10:25.250
-Well, it's magical stuff.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.210
-She took her first pill
about two hours ago.

10:27.210 --> 10:30.020
You're having a
placebo effect, Maura.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.140
-What's this?

10:31.140 --> 10:33.030
-Take one.

10:33.030 --> 10:35.600
-Trans Got Talent,
coming up again.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.560
-Yes, well you know.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.210
We made so much money
last year, that we

10:38.210 --> 10:40.640
were able to buy a
brand new Mr. Coffee.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.830
-What is Trans Got Talent.

10:41.830 --> 10:42.700
That sounds beautiful.

10:42.700 --> 10:45.640
-Well girl, if you got talent,
now's the time to let it shine.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.160
-Talent defined
broadly, of course.

10:47.160 --> 10:50.830
-I might have some talent.

10:50.830 --> 10:51.840
-You never know.

10:54.940 --> 10:56.270
-Marvellous.

10:56.270 --> 10:57.680
Absolutely stunning.

10:57.680 --> 11:00.500
-I know, it needs a little
updating, but pretty great.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.200
-What?

11:01.200 --> 11:01.900
Updating?

11:01.900 --> 11:03.150
What are you talking about?

11:03.150 --> 11:05.020
This is a Buff & Hensman.

11:05.020 --> 11:06.940
-OK, Josh, you know,
why don't you--

11:06.940 --> 11:08.420
why don't you educate
me, 'cause clearly--

11:08.420 --> 11:09.920
-She's a designer, OK?

11:09.920 --> 11:12.750
She's executed million
dollar properties

11:12.750 --> 11:14.920
in Orlando and Vegas, Josh.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.410
-Yeah, whoopty fucking doo.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.790
Too bad preservationists are
jizzing themselves-- excuse

11:18.790 --> 11:21.110
me Kristin-- for a house
exactly in this condition.

11:21.110 --> 11:22.990
-Yeah, from a value
standpoint, I tend to agree.

11:22.990 --> 11:23.600
-Thank you.
-Really?

11:23.600 --> 11:24.470
-Yeah, I'm from Sotheby's.

11:24.470 --> 11:25.170
-Oh.

11:25.170 --> 11:25.870
You know what?

11:25.870 --> 11:28.210
Why don't you take,
I'm sorry, Kristin?

11:28.210 --> 11:31.470
Into the kitchen, honey, and
show her some your ideas.

11:31.470 --> 11:32.390
-Hey, Tam?

11:32.390 --> 11:33.770
Um, promise me you're
not going to touch

11:33.770 --> 11:36.440
the house without
talking to me first.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.240
-Sure, bro.

11:37.240 --> 11:37.820
Promise.

11:37.820 --> 11:38.520
-Shake on it.

11:41.010 --> 11:42.610
Not your bro.

11:42.610 --> 11:43.330
-Don't call me Tam.

11:49.210 --> 11:51.540
-Hey, you're going to
let her come in here

11:51.540 --> 11:52.470
and fucking wreck the place?

11:52.470 --> 11:53.500
-She's got great ideas.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.330
What you're just going to
bring your little real estate

11:55.330 --> 11:56.800
agent out here, and
try to sell the place

11:56.800 --> 11:57.620
right out from under us?

11:57.620 --> 11:59.270
We're staying here this summer.

11:59.270 --> 12:01.030
-Hey, she just happens to
be a real estate agent.

12:01.030 --> 12:02.300
We're in a relationship.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.450
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:03.450 --> 12:04.410
I didn't mean to offend you.

12:04.410 --> 12:06.350
You actually found,
like, the biggest titted

12:06.350 --> 12:08.030
real estate agent in
all of Los Angeles.

12:08.030 --> 12:09.270
Sounds very convenient.

12:09.270 --> 12:12.700
-Uh, by the way, they're real.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.070
-You been getting
these texts from Allie?

12:15.070 --> 12:16.390
-Yeah, I've been
ignoring them all day.

12:16.390 --> 12:18.960
Wait.

12:18.960 --> 12:19.680
Ed's gone.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.380
-Yeah.

12:22.760 --> 12:26.540
-I mean, he lived
a long life, right?

12:26.540 --> 12:29.040
-Read the rest, ass-wipe.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.970
He's missing.

12:30.970 --> 12:33.700
She just like wants to see
if we can help find him.

12:33.700 --> 12:34.450
-Oh, OK.

12:34.450 --> 12:35.200
All right.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.190
That's fucked.

12:36.190 --> 12:37.270
-So do you have plans.

12:37.270 --> 12:38.150
-Yeah, I have plans.

12:38.150 --> 12:40.990
I'm a grown man.

12:40.990 --> 12:41.840
-Come on.

12:41.840 --> 12:42.550
Let's go.

12:42.550 --> 12:43.490
-I'm not going to--

12:43.490 --> 12:45.610
-I am not going to the
marina triangle by myself.

12:45.610 --> 12:46.310
OK?

12:46.310 --> 12:49.100
You're coming with me.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.610
-OK, exactly what
time did she lose him?

12:51.610 --> 12:52.310
-I don't know.

12:52.310 --> 12:53.150
She won't tell me.

12:53.150 --> 12:55.310
I'm getting all my
info from the guard.

12:55.310 --> 12:57.340
This reminds me of
when our cat ran away.

12:57.340 --> 12:58.040
-Pepper?

12:58.040 --> 12:58.830
-Yeah.

12:58.830 --> 13:00.060
-Oh fuck.

13:00.060 --> 13:00.760
That was horrible.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.210
-And then we realised
she just went

13:02.210 --> 13:04.480
to go live with the Weisbergs.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.940
-Maybe Ed just lives
with somebody else now.

13:06.940 --> 13:08.520
-Mum would love that.

13:08.520 --> 13:09.250
-You know what?

13:09.250 --> 13:10.950
I wanted to go live
with the Weisbergs then,

13:10.950 --> 13:13.650
and I still want to
live with the Weisbergs?

13:13.650 --> 13:14.860
-You all right up there?

13:14.860 --> 13:16.610
-No, I'm not all right, OK?

13:16.610 --> 13:17.310
Ed's missing.

13:17.310 --> 13:18.010
He can't talk.

13:18.010 --> 13:19.090
He doesn't know where he is.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.130
And nobody seems to give a shit.

13:21.130 --> 13:22.990
Go look up there.

13:22.990 --> 13:24.580
-Is she OK?

13:24.580 --> 13:25.440
What the fuck is going on?

13:25.440 --> 13:27.790
-Jesus, it's Ali being Ali.

13:34.330 --> 13:36.770
-It is messed up that we
grew up in California,

13:36.770 --> 13:39.050
and they never once
took us out on a boat.

13:39.050 --> 13:41.530
-It's 'cause they were
terrified of everything.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.830
-Yeah, are Jews, like, more
anxious than the average

13:43.830 --> 13:46.520
person, or do I just notice
it because I know more Jews?

13:46.520 --> 13:49.850
-What the fuck are you
two doing up there?

13:49.850 --> 13:52.780
-We're just-- we're
making sure that Ed's

13:52.780 --> 13:55.290
not hiding in one
of these boats.

13:55.290 --> 13:56.810
Nope.

13:56.810 --> 13:59.000
Not this one.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.910
-Hey, is that the warehouse?

14:00.910 --> 14:02.970
-Yeah.

14:02.970 --> 14:05.180
-Bloody Marys?

14:05.180 --> 14:06.400
-I love you!

14:06.400 --> 14:07.370
Als!

14:07.370 --> 14:08.070
Als!

14:08.070 --> 14:09.820
Wanna get some bloodies?

14:09.820 --> 14:11.340
-You two are sociopaths.

14:11.340 --> 14:12.190
You realise that, right?

14:12.190 --> 14:12.890
-Come on!

14:17.880 --> 14:19.250
-Hi, Raquel Fein.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.100
-Look at you!

14:20.100 --> 14:20.850
A lady rabbi!

14:20.850 --> 14:21.550
Come in.

14:21.550 --> 14:22.290
-Oh-- thank you.

14:22.290 --> 14:24.540
-You're far too attractive
for a lady rabbi.

14:24.540 --> 14:26.330
-Oh, thank you.

14:26.330 --> 14:27.960
So I-- I-- heard
about Ed's health.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.140
I wanted to pay a visit.

14:29.140 --> 14:30.040
How is he?

14:30.040 --> 14:30.920
-Oh!

14:30.920 --> 14:33.400
Let me get you a Vitamin water.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.020
They were on sale
at the supermarket.

14:35.020 --> 14:36.090
-No, thank you.

14:36.090 --> 14:36.810
-Are you sure?

14:36.810 --> 14:39.300
-It's supposed to be some
kind of healthy soda.

14:39.300 --> 14:41.010
You don't mind if I do, do you?

14:41.010 --> 14:41.970
-Please!

14:41.970 --> 14:44.860
Who am I to stand between a
congregate and her vitamins,

14:44.860 --> 14:45.760
no matter what the flavour.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.210
-Oh.

14:50.210 --> 14:51.130
Mm.

14:51.130 --> 14:52.010
Mm.

14:52.010 --> 14:52.710
Mm.

14:52.710 --> 14:53.720
-Oh, worth it?

14:53.720 --> 14:54.770
-Oh, delish.

14:54.770 --> 14:56.430
-Oh good.

14:56.430 --> 14:57.130
So--

14:57.130 --> 14:57.590
-'Quel?

14:57.590 --> 14:58.290
-Yes?

14:58.290 --> 15:00.060
-Are you married?

15:00.060 --> 15:02.560
-I am married to my
job at the moment.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.740
-Probably better off.

15:03.740 --> 15:04.680
-I'm not too sure.

15:04.680 --> 15:09.900
-Although my Joshy
is not married.

15:09.900 --> 15:10.730
Maybe you two could meet.

15:10.730 --> 15:12.070
He's gorgeous,
absolutely gorgeous.

15:12.070 --> 15:14.120
How old are you?

15:14.120 --> 15:17.880
-So, do you think that Ed
would like a little visit?

15:17.880 --> 15:20.250
Maybe I could read to him?

15:20.250 --> 15:22.050
-Are those Jewish books?

15:22.050 --> 15:25.820
-Yes, hot off the
presses 2,500 years ago.

15:25.820 --> 15:27.990
-No, he wouldn't like those.

15:27.990 --> 15:30.190
He likes Dean Koontz.

15:30.190 --> 15:33.550
You got any Dean Koontz?

15:33.550 --> 15:34.270
-Is this OK?

15:34.270 --> 15:34.970
-Yeah, it's great.

15:34.970 --> 15:36.070
Thank you.

15:36.070 --> 15:37.850
-Can we get two Bloody
Marys right away.

15:37.850 --> 15:38.970
-Sure.

15:38.970 --> 15:39.670
-Ah!

15:39.670 --> 15:40.880
-Um, where the fuck is she?

15:46.560 --> 15:47.260
-Oh!

15:47.260 --> 15:49.260
I'm going to order
a baked potato.

15:49.260 --> 15:51.410
-You guys, this is,
literally, the saddest place

15:51.410 --> 15:53.270
I've ever been.

15:53.270 --> 15:55.890
-Can you-- could you just sit
down, and order some food?

15:55.890 --> 15:57.690
-No, I don't want
to just sit down.

15:57.690 --> 15:58.570
What are you guys doing?

15:58.570 --> 16:00.270
-Ali, we're just going
to get some sustenance,

16:00.270 --> 16:02.310
and then we'll go back out,
and keep looking for him.

16:05.590 --> 16:06.990
-God!

16:06.990 --> 16:10.890
A tank full of lobsters
just waiting to die.

16:10.890 --> 16:12.520
This is the last place
they're ever going to see.

16:12.520 --> 16:13.620
This place?

16:13.620 --> 16:14.340
Look at this place.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.680
Somebody decorated this.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.640
This is literally
somebody's best attempt.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.320
This is what they're
spending their blood, sweat,

16:19.320 --> 16:20.020
and tears on.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.150
-It's adorable.

16:21.150 --> 16:23.260
-And then a lady over there
with her chicken piccata.

16:23.260 --> 16:25.200
She's saving half of
her dinner for later.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.980
So she can bring
it home, and eat it

16:26.980 --> 16:28.720
with the bread and the
little pats of butter.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.060
-What's wrong with that?

16:29.060 --> 16:30.230
-In front of her
fucking Dateline--

16:30.230 --> 16:30.960
-What is the problem?

16:30.960 --> 16:33.720
- --with a folding table,
and her fuzzy slippers.

16:33.720 --> 16:34.720
-OK, all right, OK.

16:34.720 --> 16:35.690
-No, it's not all right.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.500
And the disgusting
koi pond out there

16:38.500 --> 16:39.890
with the little bloated fish.

16:39.890 --> 16:41.880
It's so sad.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.130
And your dead baby that--

16:43.130 --> 16:43.830
-What?

16:43.830 --> 16:44.260
-I'm--

16:44.260 --> 16:45.050
-Sorry

16:45.050 --> 16:45.540
-I'm sorry.

16:45.540 --> 16:45.850
-What?

16:45.850 --> 16:46.550
What?

16:46.550 --> 16:48.360
What dead baby?

16:48.360 --> 16:49.810
-My ex-girlfriend
had an abortion.

16:49.810 --> 16:51.040
-Why doesn't anyone
tell me anything?

16:51.040 --> 16:52.530
-No, I wasn't going to tell you.

16:52.530 --> 16:54.110
I haven't seen you.

16:54.110 --> 16:55.650
-You know that Mum
and Dad had all of us

16:55.650 --> 16:56.710
before they were my age.

16:56.710 --> 16:59.020
Can you imagine?

16:59.020 --> 17:00.670
Before they were my age.

17:00.670 --> 17:01.820
God!

17:01.820 --> 17:02.980
They must've been terrified.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.420
She didn't know
what to do with us.

17:04.420 --> 17:05.700
The doctors in those
days were telling

17:05.700 --> 17:06.970
women not to breastfeed.

17:06.970 --> 17:09.980
We were all just miserable
and crying and sick,

17:09.980 --> 17:12.320
because we were just
eating that gross formula.

17:12.320 --> 17:13.270
She had the tits.

17:13.270 --> 17:15.410
They were just sitting
there, big and leaky.

17:15.410 --> 17:16.780
But she didn't know
what to do with them,

17:16.780 --> 17:18.280
'cause she was told it
was wrong to use them.

17:18.280 --> 17:19.710
And who's she going to talk to?

17:19.710 --> 17:22.050
-Well, I'm not hungry anymore.

17:22.050 --> 17:22.900
-Not Dad.

17:22.900 --> 17:25.500
Jesus Christ, not Dad.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.230
Oh my god.

17:27.230 --> 17:28.690
-I'm worried about you.

17:28.690 --> 17:29.790
-I have to tell him.

17:29.790 --> 17:30.490
-No.

17:30.490 --> 17:30.770
-Yes.

17:30.770 --> 17:31.470
-Ali!

17:31.470 --> 17:32.710
-It's crazy.

17:32.710 --> 17:33.410
-Tell me what?

17:33.410 --> 17:34.790
-It's not ours to tell.

17:34.790 --> 17:37.900
-Tell me what?

17:37.900 --> 17:39.450
You're scaring the shit
out of me right now.

17:39.450 --> 17:40.950
-I love you very much.

17:40.950 --> 17:42.100
-What?

17:42.100 --> 17:44.200
-Dad is a woman.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.630
Thinks he's a woman.

17:45.630 --> 17:48.460
Wants to be a woman.

17:48.460 --> 17:49.510
Something like that.

17:52.710 --> 17:53.410
-He's trans.

17:55.910 --> 17:57.830
It's not funny, Josh.

17:57.830 --> 17:59.160
-Wait, you guys are serious?

17:59.160 --> 18:01.890
-Yeah, we're serious.

18:01.890 --> 18:02.690
-How we doing over here?

18:02.690 --> 18:03.570
Can I get something else?

18:03.570 --> 18:03.950
-Yeah.

18:03.950 --> 18:04.330
-Yeah.

18:04.330 --> 18:05.600
Can I get another Bloody Mary?

18:05.600 --> 18:06.300
-Me too.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.380
-Me three.

18:07.380 --> 18:08.080
-Three?

18:08.080 --> 18:08.780
You got it.

18:11.940 --> 18:13.250
-You left them?
-I left them.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.080
How do you misplace them?

18:14.080 --> 18:14.460
-You left your
balls in Thailand?

18:14.460 --> 18:15.700
-I misplaced them in Bangkok.

18:15.700 --> 18:17.270
-Isn't that a song?

18:17.270 --> 18:20.150
I left my balls-- listen,
speaking of which.

18:20.150 --> 18:22.440
I'm sick and tired of
singing "Happy Talk".

18:22.440 --> 18:23.170
Can I tell you that?

18:23.170 --> 18:24.400
-From "South Pacific"?
-It is from "South Pacific."

18:24.400 --> 18:25.530
-I know "South Pacific".

18:25.530 --> 18:27.080
I saw Ezio Pinza.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.480
-I don't know what
that means, and here's

18:28.480 --> 18:29.590
what I'm going to say.

18:29.590 --> 18:32.240
I have way too many needy
queers to wrangle that night.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.270
-Would I be considered a needy
queer if I asked to be in it?

18:35.270 --> 18:35.970
-Yes.

18:35.970 --> 18:36.210
-Yeah--

18:36.210 --> 18:36.960
-With you.

18:36.960 --> 18:37.660
-Yes.

18:37.660 --> 18:38.690
-We'll sing a duet.

18:38.690 --> 18:39.390
-We'll kill.

18:39.390 --> 18:39.870
-No.

18:39.870 --> 18:40.520
-We will--

18:40.520 --> 18:41.210
-Nuh-uh.

18:41.210 --> 18:41.740
-Come on.

18:41.740 --> 18:42.060
-Nuh-uh.

18:42.060 --> 18:42.760
-Please?

18:42.760 --> 18:43.650
-Do a duet with her.

18:43.650 --> 18:44.350
-No.

18:44.350 --> 18:44.850
-Come on.

18:44.850 --> 18:46.050
-All right, I'll think about it.

18:46.050 --> 18:47.150
No.

18:47.150 --> 18:50.660
Hey girl, I think
that guy in the suit

18:50.660 --> 18:52.370
is really checking you out.

18:52.370 --> 18:53.200
-No, girl.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.210
That's not my type.

18:54.210 --> 18:55.380
He's two square.

18:55.380 --> 18:56.650
-You get that all
the time, don't you?

18:56.650 --> 18:57.690
'Cause you're so pretty.

18:57.690 --> 18:58.690
-Oh, thanks.

18:58.690 --> 19:01.300
Well, I'm glad someone's
looking after all

19:01.300 --> 19:03.000
the work I've put in
to look like this.

19:03.000 --> 19:03.710
-Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

19:03.710 --> 19:04.900
-Yeah, did you do hormones?

19:04.900 --> 19:05.820
Is that all right to ask?

19:05.820 --> 19:07.200
-Yeah, you know.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.140
They're the first step, really.

19:09.140 --> 19:11.270
You learn to put up
with the mood swings,

19:11.270 --> 19:13.800
and what-not to keep
the skin looking right.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.500
Right?

19:14.500 --> 19:15.780
-Mm-hmm, like butter.

19:15.780 --> 19:16.730
Your skin's like butter.

19:16.730 --> 19:17.430
-It's shea butter.

19:17.430 --> 19:18.910
MAURA: It's so nice.

19:18.910 --> 19:20.790
-It's shea butter.

19:20.790 --> 19:23.730
-The only thing I hated
about taking the hormones

19:23.730 --> 19:27.340
was the weight gain, the weight
gain, and the weight gain.

19:27.340 --> 19:28.040
Oh my god.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.800
Like a tick I blew up.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.950
Girl, that guy is
still starting at you.

19:32.950 --> 19:33.850
Shea, that guy at the bar.

19:33.850 --> 19:35.370
-Oh, god.
-He's still staring at you.

19:35.370 --> 19:36.070
-Don't.

19:36.070 --> 19:37.490
Please don't egg him on.

19:37.490 --> 19:39.140
Stop girl, looking at him.

19:39.140 --> 19:40.010
-Look, OK, I'm sorry.

19:40.010 --> 19:40.870
-Oh shit.

19:40.870 --> 19:42.460
-What's wrong?

19:42.460 --> 19:43.160
-I know him.

19:48.110 --> 19:49.840
-Bonjour mademoiselle.

19:49.840 --> 19:50.750
-Bonjour.

19:50.750 --> 19:52.890
-You have got fabulous eyes.

19:52.890 --> 19:54.650
They're like Liz Taylor's.

19:54.650 --> 19:55.790
-Oh, OK.

19:55.790 --> 19:57.020
Thanks.

19:57.020 --> 19:57.720
-What's your name?

19:57.720 --> 19:58.690
-Davina.

19:58.690 --> 20:01.000
Oh, you meant her.

20:01.000 --> 20:01.810
-Hello.

20:01.810 --> 20:03.950
-Hello.

20:03.950 --> 20:04.800
And you are?

20:04.800 --> 20:05.500
-Shea.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.870
-Hey, Shea.

20:06.870 --> 20:10.250
-Nice to meet you.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.220
-Hey Gar.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.980
-Jesus Christ.

20:15.980 --> 20:18.440
Morty?

20:18.440 --> 20:22.820
-Been a little while since
the squash courts, huh?

20:22.820 --> 20:24.950
-I guess so.

20:24.950 --> 20:28.930
-Uh, uh, wha--
what's all of this?

20:28.930 --> 20:34.570
-Oh, uh, well this is a-- some
people call this a necklace.

20:34.570 --> 20:35.490
Um.

20:35.490 --> 20:40.260
This is a-- I guess you
would call it a rap.

20:40.260 --> 20:41.580
Mm.

20:41.580 --> 20:42.910
Here's a ring.

20:42.910 --> 20:45.140
-That's fingernail polish, huh?

20:45.140 --> 20:46.240
-How's Helen?

20:46.240 --> 20:47.210
-Helen?

20:47.210 --> 20:48.680
-Helen.

20:48.680 --> 20:49.720
-She got the lap band.

20:49.720 --> 20:50.510
She's great.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.440
She's much happier.

20:51.440 --> 20:54.030
-Good.

20:54.030 --> 20:54.730
-Jesus Christ.

20:54.730 --> 20:55.530
Help me out here, Morty.

20:55.530 --> 21:00.370
I'm telling yo-- I'm sorry.

21:00.370 --> 21:02.350
-All right, Gary.

21:02.350 --> 21:04.040
-I need a minute to wrap
my head around this.

21:04.040 --> 21:04.740
Uh--

21:04.740 --> 21:07.620
-Well-- well-- take your time.

21:07.620 --> 21:08.990
Our families went to
Montecito together.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.700
-Yeah.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.650
Yeah, we did.

21:15.650 --> 21:16.510
Montecito.

21:16.510 --> 21:18.300
Those were good times.

21:18.300 --> 21:19.860
-They were.

21:19.860 --> 21:21.600
-Hm.

21:21.600 --> 21:22.820
Hm.

21:22.820 --> 21:23.520
Ah.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.110
No hard feelings.

21:28.110 --> 21:28.810
-None.

21:31.460 --> 21:32.160
-Um.

21:34.840 --> 21:36.890
Yeah.

21:36.890 --> 21:37.590
-Bye Gar.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.210
-Oh my god, Josh.

21:54.210 --> 21:55.650
How many Bloody
Marys did you have?

21:55.650 --> 21:57.680
-So wait, does
this mean he's gay?

21:57.680 --> 21:58.380
-No.

21:58.380 --> 22:00.780
He still likes women.

22:00.780 --> 22:04.990
-Well, technically, that
does make him a lesbian.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.080
-Fuck.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.300
-Let me tell you
something, Raquel.

22:07.300 --> 22:10.100
You're actually-- you're not--
you're not getting any younger.

22:10.100 --> 22:13.650
And then you're going to be
an old rabbi with no children.

22:13.650 --> 22:14.650
I'm telling you.

22:14.650 --> 22:17.220
And then you're going to have
arthritis like-- oh my god,

22:17.220 --> 22:18.000
look!

22:18.000 --> 22:18.700
Look!

22:18.700 --> 22:19.740
They're all here!

22:19.740 --> 22:21.280
All three of you!

22:21.280 --> 22:22.140
-So Mum, is he back?

22:22.140 --> 22:22.840
-No.

22:22.840 --> 22:23.890
-We went to the warehouse.

22:23.890 --> 22:24.590
-Ah!

22:24.590 --> 22:25.790
You went to the warehouse.

22:25.790 --> 22:27.540
You didn't tell me you were
going to the warehouse.

22:27.540 --> 22:28.270
You got me something.

22:28.270 --> 22:28.970
What did you get me?

22:28.970 --> 22:30.170
-I'm not saying.

22:30.170 --> 22:32.750
-Oh, my kids love me.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.620
My daughter loves me.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.670
Oh god, kiss me.

22:36.670 --> 22:37.940
-I'm the only one
who remembered.

22:37.940 --> 22:38.640
-Hey.

22:38.640 --> 22:39.340
-Hi.

22:39.340 --> 22:42.870
-So do these people
got a way with a wedge?

22:42.870 --> 22:44.500
-Mum, Josh needs to lie down.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.980
He's had way too much to drink.

22:45.980 --> 22:46.680
JOSH: Oh, please.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.050
I can handle four bloodies.

22:48.050 --> 22:50.080
-So Mum, how was that
doctor's appointment?

22:50.080 --> 22:50.880
Huh?

22:50.880 --> 22:52.470
Joshy!

22:52.470 --> 22:54.750
This is the rabbi.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.640
Rabbi Raquel.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.040
This is Josh, I was
telling you about.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.300
He's single and gorgeous.

23:00.300 --> 23:01.000
-Yep.

23:01.000 --> 23:01.960
Did you hear that?

23:01.960 --> 23:03.560
-I did, many, many times.

23:03.560 --> 23:04.260
-Isn't he gorgeous?

23:04.260 --> 23:05.360
-The whole package.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.180
-Is she-- is she on board.

23:07.180 --> 23:08.180
Are we doing this?

23:08.180 --> 23:10.410
Hey wait, does Mom
know about Dad?

23:10.410 --> 23:11.110
-You know what?

23:11.110 --> 23:12.600
Why don't we let the rabbi go?

23:12.600 --> 23:13.300
OK?

23:13.300 --> 23:14.610
-No, no no, no no, no no.

23:14.610 --> 23:18.130
She's got to stay, because
we need you, like bad.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.860
Because something happened
at lunch that came out,

23:20.860 --> 23:22.570
Mum, that I don't know
if you know about it.

23:22.570 --> 23:23.270
-No what?

23:23.270 --> 23:25.740
-You guys, Ed has
been missing all day.

23:25.740 --> 23:26.870
-So sorry, Ed is missing?

23:26.870 --> 23:27.570
-Yes.

23:27.570 --> 23:28.440
-We need to call somebody.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.140
-But Dad--

23:29.140 --> 23:30.770
-I think if Ed is
missing, then someone

23:30.770 --> 23:33.010
should probably call the police.

23:33.010 --> 23:34.060
-Police, thank you, yes.

23:34.060 --> 23:35.030
I'm going to call the police.

23:35.030 --> 23:36.230
-Wait, on who?

23:36.230 --> 23:38.130
-We're not calling
me on anybody, Sarah.

23:38.130 --> 23:38.990
Ed is missing.

23:38.990 --> 23:40.390
We're calling to see
if they've found him.

23:40.390 --> 23:41.080
-No, all right.

23:41.080 --> 23:41.940
Well that's--

23:41.940 --> 23:43.880
-What I'm trying to say is
Dad is a fucking transvestite.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.940
-That is not the word, OK?

23:45.940 --> 23:46.800
He's trans.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.830
-Oh, that.

23:48.830 --> 23:49.600
Of course, I know that.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.130
You think I'm a dummy?

23:51.130 --> 23:52.070
-Oh my god.

23:52.070 --> 23:52.770
-You know?

23:52.770 --> 23:53.820
-Where the fuck is the phone?

23:53.820 --> 23:55.150
-You knew?

23:55.150 --> 23:56.490
-It's his thing.

23:56.490 --> 23:58.340
It's his little private kink.

23:58.340 --> 23:59.610
Everyone has one.

23:59.610 --> 24:00.640
It's something you can confirm.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.450
Right, rabbi?

24:01.450 --> 24:02.150
Everyone has one.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.420
-I suppose everybody
has one or t--two.

24:04.420 --> 24:05.300
-Thank you.

24:05.300 --> 24:06.220
-No, no, no, no.

24:06.220 --> 24:06.920
No, no, no.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.070
He's doing it all the time.

24:08.070 --> 24:09.860
He's doing it in public.

24:09.860 --> 24:11.620
-Ah-- yes, I'd like to
report a missing person.

24:11.620 --> 24:14.440
-So he's out there dressing
up outside like a woman?

24:14.440 --> 24:15.140
-Yes.

24:15.140 --> 24:15.410
-Mum--

24:15.410 --> 24:16.100
-Oh.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.170
-Mum, how old is Ed?

24:17.170 --> 24:18.100
-71.

24:18.100 --> 24:18.800
Oh, wait.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.230
That's not true,
he's 70, uh, 74.

24:21.230 --> 24:23.690
-They went to the Beverly
Centre with him like that, Mum.

24:23.690 --> 24:24.390
-Eww.

24:24.390 --> 24:25.920
No one goes to the
Beverly Centre.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.470
-Does he have any
distinguishing marks?

24:27.470 --> 24:28.170
-Any what?

24:28.170 --> 24:29.210
Distinguishing marks?

24:29.210 --> 24:31.120
That's a stupid question.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.830
Everyone has
distinguishing mark.

24:32.830 --> 24:33.880
-Is that true, rabbi?

24:33.880 --> 24:36.390
-I suppose everybody has
one or two, like, you know,

24:36.390 --> 24:37.210
freckles or birthmarks.

24:37.210 --> 24:39.870
-What our Ed's
distinguishing marks, Mum?

24:39.870 --> 24:40.720
-Oh my god.

24:40.720 --> 24:43.120
It's so obvious now
why Dad wasn't around.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.360
It's because he was
playing Little Bo Peep.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.370
But what about you, Mum?

24:46.370 --> 24:47.570
What's your excuse?

24:47.570 --> 24:49.790
You got a little secret that
you were doing while you were

24:49.790 --> 24:52.220
paying Rita to distract
me with her tits?

24:52.220 --> 24:53.490
-Why are you humiliating
me like this?

24:53.490 --> 24:55.050
-You're going to add that
into the whole thing?

24:55.050 --> 24:55.990
-Just shut the fuck up.

24:55.990 --> 24:57.360
-I'm going to give
you space and privacy.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.010
I'll be back.

24:58.010 --> 24:58.710
-Please stay.

24:58.710 --> 25:01.390
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, please.

25:01.390 --> 25:02.300
Please.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.420
I'm sorry.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.870
Will you please help us?

25:06.870 --> 25:08.020
Please?

25:08.020 --> 25:14.510
-Well, I can-- I'll try.

25:14.510 --> 25:15.210
-Thank you.

25:29.910 --> 25:31.690
-He's back.

25:31.690 --> 25:34.740
