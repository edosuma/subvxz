00:00.584 --> 00:03.086
I used to be Denver Fire Department.
I was injured on the job.

00:03.212 --> 00:05.755
- That injury was four years ago.
- So, the painkillers he's on...

00:05.881 --> 00:09.050
- He's been on those a long time.
- You are looking for an easy save.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.594
Would you want your only daughter
to be a firefighter?

00:11.720 --> 00:13.888
- Give her the boot.
- Are we really gonna do this?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.890
Her father is Deputy District Chief.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.851
He's doing everything he can to make
sure you get stuck behind a desk.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.103
Jones!

00:21.188 --> 00:23.147
- Is everything OK with Casey?
- Yeah.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.775
- You don't want me to be a firefighter.
- Gabby, take a deep breath.

00:25.901 --> 00:26.901
Don't condescend to me...

00:27.027 --> 00:28.653
Whatever I say,
you take it the wrong way.

00:28.779 --> 00:29.737
Then don't say anything.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.324
Is it Shay's birthday or something?

00:33.450 --> 00:36.077
No, no, it's just a girls' weekend.
You're cool with that, right?

00:36.662 --> 00:38.663
Yeah, of course.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.167
Does this hat make me look silly?
My mom gave it to me.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.129
No, I like it.

00:52.052 --> 00:56.055
Hey, I'm sorry I told Jones
what her dad was up to. I really am.

00:59.393 --> 01:04.188
- I thought she deserved to know.
- I did too. We were going to tell her.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.692
I wish you'd come to me first.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.239
Yeah, I should have. You're right.

01:21.373 --> 01:25.084
Apartment listings? When I get home,
we're going to find a great place.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.712
Maybe we should stop looking.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.549
What?

01:31.675 --> 01:33.593
We've been saying
we'd do this for months,

01:33.719 --> 01:36.220
it still hasn't happened.
It shouldn't be this hard.

01:42.394 --> 01:43.519
That's Shay.

01:49.985 --> 01:52.737
- I'll miss you.
- Yeah. Miss you, too.

01:57.201 --> 01:59.994
Oatmeal? If I wanted to
be healthy and miserable,

02:00.120 --> 02:01.621
I would've stayed home.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.456
Jones is dropping the ball.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.625
Well, Jones is late. Capp made that.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.127
Well, that explains it then.

02:08.253 --> 02:10.505
Damn, Mouch, you haven't
even touched the stuff.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.006
No appetite.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.551
Not one reply
to my Golden Oldeez profile.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.178
Nothing? Not even a bite?

02:17.304 --> 02:20.681
Fifty-four views,
but no follow-ups or whatever.

02:20.808 --> 02:24.227
- What the hell is that, Mouch?
- What?

02:29.274 --> 02:31.734
Hey, that's private, by the way.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.278
Why would you put
this photo on your profile?

02:34.404 --> 02:39.075
I asked Shay and she said
women like a bad boy.

02:39.201 --> 02:42.411
So you basically asked a lesbian
what she looks for in a man.

02:42.538 --> 02:45.373
- Fair point.
- I'll tell you what women like.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.124
Firemen, you knucklehead!

02:47.251 --> 02:49.418
I like where you're going with this.

02:49.545 --> 02:52.630
Look, we are deleting
this profile picture...

02:52.756 --> 02:54.841
...and putting up a new one.
- When? How?

02:54.967 --> 02:56.717
Right now. Come on.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.219
Uh, right there.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.971
And smile.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.266
OK. Let's try it.

03:03.392 --> 03:06.811
Oh, no, that's who's subbing
for Shay and Dawson?

03:06.937 --> 03:10.606
Howdy Doody ain't that bad,
but the other guy's Bad Luck Schleprock.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.276
- He's what?
- Hey, Chout. Hey, McAuley.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.444
Hey, guys!
Glad to be back with the old 5-1.

03:15.571 --> 03:19.699
Welcome back, guys. The, um, oatmeal's
in the Crock-Pot. Help yourselves.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.492
Is it gluten free?

03:21.618 --> 03:25.204
- I don't even know what that means.
- It's not gluten-free, McAuley.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.794
So, when are you bouncing me from 51?

03:31.920 --> 03:33.462
I'm not. Have a seat.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.927
Look, I don't know what's going on
between you and your father.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.346
It's none of my business.
But as far as I'm concerned,

03:42.472 --> 03:45.308
you are one of my firefighters,
and my job is to protect your job.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.561
He'll come after you. I know him.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.314
Well, I'll deal with that
when and if that happens.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.614
It's the one thing that I wanted,
my whole life.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.282
And he's taking it away from me.

04:02.159 --> 04:07.538
Jones, if you don't want him
transferring you to PR, then don't go.

04:08.540 --> 04:09.957
Put your foot down.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.127
Or go, and make your dad happy.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.712
You've got to figure it out.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.758
It's all gonna work out, Jones.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.515
Well, at least I know
you guys have my back.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.727
You know, I'd like to, um,
take a personal day

04:29.853 --> 04:31.854
and settle this once and for all.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.274
That sounds like a good idea.
See you next shift.

04:38.987 --> 04:42.657
- There's something else going on there.
- You make sure you check in on her.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.451
Definitely.

04:45.577 --> 04:49.830
Engine 51,
Truck 81, Ambulance 61, apartment fire.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.839
- Get that extinguisher up here.
- On my way up.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.925
I think we got a grease fire.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.552
Ridge, move your ass!
We're gonna lose the whole kitchen.

05:03.679 --> 05:06.347
- Coming in!
- Let's go, Ridge!

05:06.473 --> 05:08.182
Come on.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.482
Put some Lake Michigan on that.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.824
Hmm, found the culprit.

05:24.950 --> 05:29.453
What idiot leaves a pan full of grease
on the stove unattended?

05:29.579 --> 05:32.957
Oh, my God, is Gavin OK?
I live across the hallway.

05:33.083 --> 05:36.794
TV's playing. Stove's on.
Is he around here somewhere?

05:36.920 --> 05:39.046
I saw him yelling in the hallway
about an hour ago.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.257
- Who was he fighting with?
- He was on his cell.

05:41.383 --> 05:45.302
We get horrible cell reception in the
building so we usually go to the roof.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.723
Gavin! Fire Department, call out!

05:48.849 --> 05:51.350
Gavin! Call out!

05:51.476 --> 05:53.519
Gavin, you up here?

05:53.645 --> 05:55.563
Nothing on the south side.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.939
Nothing on the east side.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.025
Nothing on the west side.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.110
Help!

06:02.446 --> 06:04.447
Hear that?

06:05.657 --> 06:06.949
Fire Department, call out.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.492
Over here!

06:08.618 --> 06:10.578
Fire Department. Call out!

06:10.704 --> 06:11.912
Down here!

06:12.039 --> 06:13.622
Where is this guy?

06:13.749 --> 06:16.208
Help, I'm stuck! Down here!

06:19.046 --> 06:21.088
Get Squad here now!

06:30.682 --> 06:31.891
Herrmann, talk to me.

06:32.017 --> 06:35.436
He's, uh, ass down, head and feet up.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.939
Give me a measurement
from the end of the building.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.695
Twenty-seven feet,
eight inches from the back corner.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.531
Copy that. Lower down
an open radio and a mask.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.493
Gavin, I'm lowering
you down a radio and a mask.

06:50.619 --> 06:54.080
Put the mask on so you don't breathe
the dust from the drilling.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.165
Wait, what? What drilling?

06:56.291 --> 06:58.542
Gavin, this is Lieutenant Severide.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.463
We can't climb down to get you, so we're
going to have to drill through the wall.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.465
Capp, use the three-quarter
on the hammer drill.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.175
I want three feet from
the side of the X.

07:06.301 --> 07:09.095
Casey, how's he doing?

07:09.221 --> 07:11.764
- Fading.
- Go to channel three for me.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.224
Copy.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.268
- Casey?
- Smiling death?

07:16.394 --> 07:17.770
He's been compressed for so long,

07:17.896 --> 07:20.564
when we cut him out,
he's gonna have a 50-50 chance.

07:20.690 --> 07:21.857
Want family here?

07:23.944 --> 07:26.946
- Give me five minutes.
- Copy. Back to one.

07:27.072 --> 07:31.784
Mills, air chisel two bricks out
on the top of the X for me.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.002
Hey, I'm getting
kind of tired in here.

07:42.754 --> 07:46.090
Hey, Gavin, I hear you're a big UFC fan.
Who's your favorite fighter?

07:46.216 --> 07:47.633
Johny Hendricks.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.177
Yeah? Too bad he got his
ass kicked by St-Pierre.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.097
Look, obviously you
didn't see that fight.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.850
Everybody knows Hendricks got robbed.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.643
Stick to badminton, pal.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.937
Dude, I will kick your ass
for saying that.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.523
- I'm not even joking.
- Uh-huh.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.358
Alright, I'm through.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.734
Alright, guys, get in there.

08:05.861 --> 08:08.654
Uh, get me a 14 gauge
and spike a bag.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.536
McAULEY: You're going to feel
a little prick.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.496
Hang in there, Gavin.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.375
McAULEY: I'm going to give you
some sodium bicarb.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.796
- Bicarb's in.
- Alright.

08:25.922 --> 08:29.049
- Good to go.
- Mills, Capp, finish it off.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.305
Stay with us, Gavin.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.061
Come on, come on, come on.

08:44.149 --> 08:47.526
- Alright, we're good.
- Alright, guys, get in there.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.862
- Got him?
- Yeah.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.243
One, two, three.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.474
Now what do you
gotta say to my face?

09:18.600 --> 09:21.602
Oh, I was just messing with you
to keep your heart rate up, Gavin.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.189
One, two, three. Up!

09:25.315 --> 09:27.858
You got it?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.782
This is Severide.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.039
Hey, I'm Kelly... Severide.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.666
Oh, yeah.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.961
A guy claiming to be a fireman
dropped your name on a DUI.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.880
I wanted to make sure he wasn't lying
before I booked him.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.423
You know him?

09:53.969 --> 09:55.261
Yeah.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.263
- Anyone hurt?
- Nah.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.348
- Just veered off into a ditch.
- Thanks.

10:01.559 --> 10:05.104
Hey, it's my bad. It's totally my fault.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.773
I took a couple of pills.
I had a flare up with my back.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.276
And then a buddy calls me,
he's going through a divorce,

10:10.402 --> 10:13.320
- wants to meet for a few drinks...
- You need to get into rehab.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.075
I hear you, but there's no need.
I mean, I got a handle on this.

10:18.201 --> 10:21.537
What... What I need
is help with this DUI charge,

10:21.663 --> 10:24.123
cos if it sticks, I won't get into CFD.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.708
Good luck.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.003
Alright, alright, alright. OK!

10:30.630 --> 10:32.006
OK what?

10:32.799 --> 10:35.509
- I'll go.
- Look at me.

10:38.054 --> 10:41.765
I will go to rehab. There, you happy?

10:48.857 --> 10:52.234
Any way we can let this slide?
He was a fireman in Denver.

10:52.360 --> 10:56.697
He's just looking for another shot here.
He's just had a tough go at it lately.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.783
So you're vouching for him?

11:02.954 --> 11:05.456
Yes, I'm vouching for him.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.499
I'll see what I can do.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.044
Thank you. Appreciate it. I owe you one.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.378
Dinner?

11:13.965 --> 11:15.466
Oh, I'm just messing with you.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.802
You wouldn't be able to handle me
anyway. I'd snap you right in half.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.598
- Um...
- Yeah, so beat it. I got work to do.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.480
- Sit tight.
- Alright.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.369
- Where are the seven dwarves, right?
- Yeah, it's awesome.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.662
Mmm, do you smell that?

11:45.789 --> 11:48.582
It's like one of those pine-scented air
thingies you get at the car wash.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.543
Welcome to paradise at Baileys Harbor.

11:51.669 --> 11:55.714
- You must be Leslie.
- Hi. Yeah, this is my friend Gabby.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.008
Hi, I'm Margie Cavanaugh.
This is my husband, Thomas.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.343
Pleasure to meet you.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.346
Anything you need, just ask.
We're right next door.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.390
- Thanks.
- Enjoy that fireplace.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.729
Ah! This is gonna be great.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.276
Huh. Yeah, so after reading the website,

12:16.403 --> 12:21.865
I guess they worked at the
Board of Trade in Chicago for 15 years,

12:21.991 --> 12:26.078
- then cashed out, bought this place.
- Awesome.

12:26.204 --> 12:29.248
Yeah... That's going to be
you and Casey in 20 years.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.208
Matching sweaters,

12:31.334 --> 12:34.461
perfect little kids running around,
playing lacrosse.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.884
You OK?

12:44.431 --> 12:45.973
What's wrong?

12:48.017 --> 12:49.393
Nothing.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.355
You and Casey?

12:56.609 --> 12:58.318
What the hell is going on?

13:07.412 --> 13:09.913
The worst part is he's not wrong.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.791
I mean, we've been looking
for apartments for two months.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.544
Do you know how many apartments
are available in Chicago right now?

13:15.670 --> 13:17.754
- A lot.
- A lot.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.631
But I'm dragging my feet and...

13:22.177 --> 13:25.929
Is it because he lied to me
about the extent of his injury?

13:26.055 --> 13:29.933
Or because he almost lost it
on that guy at the restaurant

13:30.059 --> 13:32.769
who he thought was looking at me?
I mean, it was a big deal at the time,

13:32.896 --> 13:34.855
and now it's not, so...

13:34.981 --> 13:37.483
I don't understand
why I'm feeling like this.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.529
I'm here to help. Whatever you need.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.409
- OK, I have to rally.
- Yes, absolutely.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.787
- Did you bring alcohol?
- Girl, get to know me already.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.917
I'll grab some glasses.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.387
So, our girls are out
in the boondocks, huh?

14:07.514 --> 14:10.724
Yeah, I guess they've had it planned
for a while and kept pushing it.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.561
I bet you anything one of them
comes back with a rescue squirrel.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.317
How's everything with you and Dawson?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.697
What?

14:26.366 --> 14:29.201
I was about to ask you
for relationship advice,

14:29.327 --> 14:31.912
but that'd be like getting
fitness tips from Mouch.

14:32.747 --> 14:36.333
I have been in a lot of
meaningful relationships.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.502
Oh, yeah, what was
meaningful about them?

14:38.628 --> 14:42.673
Chivalry prevents me from
going any further into...

14:43.550 --> 14:46.218
What's the matter? Getting cold feet?

14:48.596 --> 14:53.016
I'm not sure.
Maybe we're moving too fast?

14:55.061 --> 14:57.854
Look, there's no such thing
as moving too fast.

14:57.981 --> 15:01.900
You just jump in, and either
luck's on your side or it ain't.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.747
- Any word from Dawson and Shay?
- No cell phone reception.

15:15.873 --> 15:19.126
- What are they doing anyway?
- Girls' weekend.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.838
- What?
- Seems odd.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.465
- Why?
- I don't know, it just seems odd.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.843
That is not a girls' weekend.

15:27.969 --> 15:30.053
That is a future bride
and a future maid of honor

15:30.179 --> 15:32.431
scoping out wedding spots for you two.

15:32.557 --> 15:36.143
- You got it all figured out, huh, Cruz?
- Mark my words, Lieutenant.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.395
I don't know.
He's probably right, Casey.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.940
In fact, you should start enjoying
your last bits of freedom while you can,

15:42.066 --> 15:44.443
A.K.A. poker night with the boys.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.362
Hey, now you're talking!

15:47.488 --> 15:48.655
Just keep a lid on it.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.907
Poker night? Huh!
I'll move some stuff around,

15:51.034 --> 15:53.118
and see if I can make it.
When and where?

15:53.244 --> 15:56.538
Uh, nothing's been firmed up yet.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.541
Tomorrow night! Cruz and I will host.
Break in our new apartment.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.460
- Boom, boom!
- I got a hit!

16:01.586 --> 16:02.669
What?

16:02.795 --> 16:06.048
Nursing home provider
from Gurnee.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.050
There, buddy! She's cute.

16:08.176 --> 16:11.970
Nursing home workers have the highest
rate of depression in any field.

16:12.096 --> 16:15.557
They have to care for people who are
oftentimes incapable of expressing

16:15.683 --> 16:20.354
gratitude or appreciation.
Takes a real toll, apparently.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.237
- DUI.
- Yeah, I mean...

16:29.364 --> 16:31.657
- The guy's hit rock bottom.
- You sure?

16:31.783 --> 16:34.493
I tried calling over to
the Denver Fire Department

16:34.619 --> 16:37.871
to look into any benefits he might have,
in terms of insurance for rehab,

16:37.997 --> 16:39.373
but they gave me the run around.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.167
So, I was hoping
you would call over there.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.505
You really are sticking your neck
out for this guy.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.340
I was in his shoes not too long ago.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.592
I needed help getting on the other side
of it, Chief.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.427
What if he doesn't want your help?

16:53.179 --> 16:56.098
What if he's just agreeing with you
so he can beat this DUI charge,

16:56.224 --> 16:57.474
and you get left holding the bag?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.726
I don't wake up every morning
with the expectation that

16:59.852 --> 17:01.645
I'm gonna bat a thousand, Chief.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.568
- Alright.
- So you'll do it? You'll call Denver?

17:08.695 --> 17:10.487
I'm gonna call Guildhaus
over in Blue Island.

17:10.613 --> 17:13.240
They have a live-in facility for
firefighters and their families.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.951
They take care of our people.
They never turn anyone away.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.327
Thank you.

17:17.453 --> 17:21.873
Kelly, do you know what this
Bloom guy's really running away from?

17:23.209 --> 17:25.460
- Back injury on the job.
- And that's all?

17:25.586 --> 17:27.546
I don't know. He's not the sharing type.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.048
I just figure it'd be best
to try and get him clean first.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.636
I'll make the call.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.184
Hey, Jones.
It's Lieutenant Casey.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.062
Just checking in. Uh...

17:45.022 --> 17:46.648
Yeah, let me know what's going on,

17:46.774 --> 17:48.942
or if there's anything
I can do on my end.

17:52.155 --> 17:55.949
Engine 51,
Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61...

18:05.877 --> 18:09.671
The whole situation is under control.
We've created a tight perimeter.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.549
He wouldn't listen to me,
told me to back off.

18:13.259 --> 18:16.511
Casey, you and Herrmann on juno lines?

18:16.637 --> 18:20.098
- In position. Ready to go.
- Severide, you in position?

18:20.224 --> 18:21.433
Yeah. One minute away, Chief.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.811
Hey.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.063
What's your name, pal?

18:27.190 --> 18:30.484
Jerry. Now leave me alone.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.486
What's the problem here?

18:33.738 --> 18:35.113
What do you care?

18:35.990 --> 18:39.743
Just curious, for when your parents ask.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.873
My girl left me.

18:45.750 --> 18:49.211
Come on. You're a good-looking kid.
You'll find another one.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.087
Not like her!

18:53.132 --> 18:55.759
Alright, I'm climbing out here
next to you and we can talk this out.

18:55.885 --> 18:59.304
Stay away from me! No tricks!
I just want to die!

19:09.148 --> 19:12.526
Jerry, listen to me.
You don't want to do this.

19:12.652 --> 19:16.071
People who take their own lives,
and I've seen a few,

19:16.197 --> 19:18.448
they have a plan, man.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.621
You got your heart broke,
and came up here in the heat of it.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.334
Come on, come on, come on!

19:30.461 --> 19:34.589
Jerry, Jerry, you do not
want to kill yourself.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.008
Watch me.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.225
Tell her I loved her.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.951
Please don't drop me!

20:03.077 --> 20:06.246
Always seems like a good idea
until your feet leave the ground, huh?

20:06.372 --> 20:07.664
Easy!

20:11.544 --> 20:14.296
And I think, also,
you've been under a lot of stress.

20:14.422 --> 20:15.839
Another excellent point.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.174
Fire Academy's stressful to begin with,
I'm assuming.

20:18.301 --> 20:19.676
Extremely.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.721
Then you get injured,
have to see Jones take your spot.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.640
And she's a pill on top of it all.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.392
I have no beef with Jones.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.311
We were the only two females
at the Academy,

20:29.437 --> 20:32.314
with a bunch of guys staring at us
because they didn't think we belonged,

20:32.440 --> 20:33.940
waiting for us to fail.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.902
And anything she did
that I didn't like at the time,

20:37.028 --> 20:40.697
looking back on it now, it's just
because she was scared, like I was.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.325
Eh. Still a bit of a pill.

20:46.078 --> 20:49.039
Well, Casey doesn't
want me to be a firefighter.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.374
- Oh, that's crazy.
- It's not.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.586
Didn't he pull strings
so that you could retake the test?

20:54.712 --> 20:56.922
Yeah, only after he found out
I was gonna retake it anyway.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.591
Ask me a question and I will.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.968
Ask me a question and I will.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.556
Is that the perfect couple
that owns this place?

21:06.682 --> 21:09.225
I ask you what time it is
and you tell me how to build a watch.

21:09.352 --> 21:10.352
Oh, really?

21:10.478 --> 21:12.187
I should've listened
to my brother

21:12.313 --> 21:13.730
and married Erin from Highland Park.

21:13.856 --> 21:16.733
And I should have listened
to your brother and married him.

21:16.859 --> 21:19.903
I love hearing couples argue.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.029
So good.

21:21.155 --> 21:23.657
You are an idiot, Thomas,
a total moron.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.826
Which is why
I married you, Margie!

21:27.411 --> 21:30.163
Anybody heard from Jones?

21:30.289 --> 21:33.208
- Not yet.
- See? Simple as that.

21:33.334 --> 21:35.877
- So it's a date?
- Tomorrow night. Congrats.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.545
Alright!

21:37.672 --> 21:40.548
Well, looks like Mouch
is out for poker night. Who's in?

21:40.675 --> 21:41.883
Me!

21:42.009 --> 21:45.637
Hey, what kind of poker we talking
about? Draw? Stud? Hold 'em? What?

21:45.763 --> 21:48.556
Yeah, whatever. You know what's a hoot?
You guys ever play Indian poker?

21:48.683 --> 21:52.852
What is this, summer camp?
You just sprout your pubes there, Otis?

21:53.562 --> 21:55.981
McAULEY: So you guys are hosting?
I need an address.

21:56.107 --> 21:59.401
Yeah, look, Otis and I can host, but
no cigars. Landlord won't allow it.

21:59.527 --> 22:02.570
Alright, I'll host. But everybody's
got to bring snacks and beer.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.739
I'm not getting chiseled on this deal.

22:06.951 --> 22:10.203
Herrmann, you in? Lieutenant?

22:10.329 --> 22:13.915
You know, I would come to poker night,
but it sounds so fun,

22:14.041 --> 22:16.584
I'm afraid it would ruin me from
ever wanting to do anything else

22:16.711 --> 22:18.545
other than hanging out with the guys.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.046
Aw.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.716
I'm getting ribs from Carson's
for dinner.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.052
- Alright, maybe a few hands.
- Ah!

22:26.178 --> 22:27.595
That's the spirit!

22:27.722 --> 22:31.224
I got to duck out.
I'll have my radio on.

22:39.734 --> 22:41.943
I am issuing him an I-Bond.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.695
Conditions are as follows,

22:43.821 --> 22:48.742
do not get rearrested and complete
a substance abuse program.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.828
The pills we found will be inventoried,
but he won't be charged.

22:51.954 --> 22:54.122
- I got a prescription.
- Shut up!

22:54.248 --> 22:56.666
I'm not gonna impound the car,
although I should.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.627
He'll get a ticket for reckless driving,
which can always be upgraded

22:59.754 --> 23:02.005
if the bond is violated.

23:02.131 --> 23:05.091
I don't want him in a vehicle
unless it's got checkers on it.

23:05.217 --> 23:09.262
And I'm telling you all this
because it's your ass if I get played.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.556
Is that understood?

23:12.266 --> 23:15.310
Got it. Thank you. Let's go.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.148
Alright, so here's the deal...
Rehab? I'm all for it.

23:20.274 --> 23:22.901
But I've got some loose ends
to wrap up, you know?

23:23.027 --> 23:25.111
Important family matters
that I've got to deal with...

23:25.237 --> 23:29.908
Bloom! Hey, listen, I'm not Florence
Nightingale, alright?

23:30.034 --> 23:32.160
I got better things to do than
trying to convince you

23:32.286 --> 23:34.245
to get your life straight.
If you don't want my help,

23:34.371 --> 23:37.957
just get your ass back in that district
and hash it out with Sergeant Platt.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.839
Alright. Where do I got to be?

23:45.424 --> 23:48.760
Place is called the Guildhaus.
I'll meet you there tomorrow.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.678
I'll text you all the info.

23:52.389 --> 23:53.431
Alright.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.436
Is this just about your back injury?

24:00.314 --> 24:02.148
Is there anything else I should know?

24:03.984 --> 24:06.820
You just text me where and when
and I'll be there.

24:14.203 --> 24:18.081
- Chief Jones. Lieutenant Casey.
- Oh, I remember.

24:18.207 --> 24:21.459
I'm not sure if you've heard or not,
but your daughter,

24:21.585 --> 24:24.129
she's hip to the fact
you want her in PR.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.755
I heard.

24:25.881 --> 24:30.969
OK. Um, look, it's none of my business,
but Rebecca is taking this pretty hard,

24:31.095 --> 24:32.720
and I just wanted to take another run

24:32.847 --> 24:35.640
at the possibility that maybe
you let her stay on Truck for...

24:35.766 --> 24:39.394
Do me a favor, start that
first sentence over again.

24:40.563 --> 24:44.190
- Uh, it's none of my business, but...
- There you go.

24:56.078 --> 24:58.329
You made me this way,
you know that?

24:58.455 --> 25:00.498
I never raised my voice
before I met you!

25:00.624 --> 25:02.750
I don't know how they're
not hoarse by now.

25:02.877 --> 25:05.211
Just go to the store
and get a new toilet!

25:05.337 --> 25:07.547
Oh, my God.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.300
You never know what couples are like
behind closed doors, right?

25:10.426 --> 25:12.760
Oh, I'm going?
I've got to do everything around here!

25:12.887 --> 25:15.430
- Well, you could...
- I'm kicking myself. You know why?

25:15.556 --> 25:17.432
- Why?
- What happened to our game plan?

25:17.558 --> 25:18.766
You're absolutely right.

25:18.893 --> 25:22.478
Come on! Let's get into that tequila
and play some Boggle already.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.105
Yeah.

25:25.941 --> 25:29.944
Oh, my God! Help! Somebody help!

25:38.787 --> 25:41.581
- Oh, my God! Thomas!
- Go call 911 now!

25:47.713 --> 25:50.256
911 said the soonest
they can be here is in 30 minutes.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.383
What? Isn't there
an ambulance in this town?

25:52.509 --> 25:55.220
No, we're unincorporated.
Is he gonna die?

25:55.346 --> 25:58.181
- Not if we can help it.
- Three to four inch laceration.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.808
No crepitus, pupils are equal.

26:00.935 --> 26:03.186
Margie, grab towels,
sheets and duct tape.

26:03.312 --> 26:07.065
- Do you know what you're doing?
- We're paramedics. Go!

26:07.942 --> 26:12.070
Hey, Thomas, you have a real serious cut
on your head. OK?

26:12.196 --> 26:15.240
My wife is right. I'm an idiot.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.327
- I should have called the plumber.
- Hey, hey. Everybody makes mistakes.

26:19.453 --> 26:20.453
I got it!

26:27.920 --> 26:29.462
Hold that.

26:30.464 --> 26:33.633
Hang in there.
Breathe deep, breathe deep...

26:35.010 --> 26:38.221
- Alright, bleeding's stopped.
- Is he going to be OK?

26:38.347 --> 26:40.765
- We got him stabilized.
- My leg!

26:44.478 --> 26:46.938
- His pulse is weak and tachy.
- I feel a deformity to the thigh.

26:47.064 --> 26:48.648
His femur's broken.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.359
Margie do you have
any, uh, crutches on the property?

26:51.485 --> 26:52.777
No.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.865
- Hey! Traction splint.
- On it.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.576
Please make it stop!

27:00.703 --> 27:03.329
Hey, Thomas, we're gonna get some wood
to make a traction splint.

27:03.455 --> 27:07.000
I know you're in a lot of pain, but I
need you to find a way to calm down, OK?

27:08.002 --> 27:09.585
Where's my wife?

27:14.717 --> 27:16.634
Dawson, watch your head.

27:21.557 --> 27:24.100
He's lost a lot of blood.
I'm not sure how much longer he has.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.811
What if we put him in your car
and drive him toward the ambulance?

27:26.937 --> 27:28.896
There's a possibility
of a spinal injury.

27:29.023 --> 27:32.191
If we move him with the wrong equipment,
he'll die for sure.

27:36.030 --> 27:38.990
Please forgive me. I'm so sorry.

27:39.116 --> 27:42.243
It all seems so stupid now.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.581
Of course I forgive you.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.751
Do you forgive me?

27:55.049 --> 27:57.967
- Thomas! Thomas!
- He's crashing!

27:58.093 --> 28:01.054
Don't leave me. Thomas! I need you!

28:01.180 --> 28:02.930
Stay with us, Thomas.

28:07.061 --> 28:09.604
- Hey, what's up, Chief?
- Hey, Herrmann.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.147
Do you still have a connection with

28:11.273 --> 28:13.900
the Illinois Female Firefighters
Association?

28:14.026 --> 28:17.028
Yeah, I help them run drills
for their seminars twice a year.

28:17.154 --> 28:20.323
Anyone strike you there
as mentor material?

28:21.158 --> 28:23.743
Mary Lou Monzella... Great gal.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.245
Do me a favor, hook her up
with Jones, will you?

28:27.289 --> 28:30.083
Maybe her and Mary Lou, they can
go and have a coffee or something.

28:30.209 --> 28:33.086
Yeah. No sweat.
I think she's out of town this week,

28:33.212 --> 28:36.005
but I'll give her a call.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.965
Everything alright with Jones?

28:38.092 --> 28:42.011
Oh, yeah, she just needs someone
to talk to. So...

28:42.554 --> 28:44.138
Alright. Got it.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.808
Chief Donaldson from
Denver Fire Department on line one.

28:46.934 --> 28:48.643
OK. I got to take this.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.691
Why do I have to be the girl?

28:55.818 --> 28:57.985
Just do it, Cruz, and stop your whining.

28:58.112 --> 28:59.529
- Fine.
- Sit!

28:59.655 --> 29:02.156
OK, alright! Ready, Mouch!

29:03.575 --> 29:05.701
OK.

29:05.828 --> 29:09.372
- Hi, Randy, nice to meet you.
- You too.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.462
OK. Hold on. Mouch, what are you doing?

29:16.588 --> 29:18.464
- Reading the menu.
- Why?

29:18.590 --> 29:21.050
To see what they serve for dinner.

29:21.176 --> 29:24.053
Why so soon, I guess is my question.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.346
Uh...

29:25.472 --> 29:27.974
- Can I jump in here?
- Yeah, please.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.977
When you walk in to meet a blind date...

29:31.145 --> 29:32.812
Look like you?
Well, that ain't happening,

29:32.938 --> 29:36.691
so she can take me or leave me,
warts and all.

29:37.401 --> 29:39.610
- Can I finish? OK.
- Sorry.

29:39.736 --> 29:42.864
Engage in conversation.
Ask her something.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.200
OK, OK. Fine.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.955
- Walk back in again?
- Just start from there. You got it.

29:51.081 --> 29:53.332
- Hello.
- Hello.

29:53.459 --> 29:56.836
- Uh, where are you from?
- Can I jump in real quick?

29:56.962 --> 29:59.422
Sorry... You should already know
where she's from

29:59.548 --> 30:03.050
because she has a profile
on the website, just like you do.

30:03.177 --> 30:04.552
Yep. Good point, good point.

30:04.678 --> 30:07.096
So if you ask a question
that's already on the profile,

30:07.222 --> 30:09.348
she's gonna think you didn't
bother to read it. OK?

30:09.475 --> 30:13.060
- So just branch out a little.
- Uh-huh. OK.

30:21.612 --> 30:24.572
Name five things you're scared of.

30:27.075 --> 30:29.577
Uh, being here with you,

30:29.703 --> 30:32.580
on this date just became
number one for me right now.

30:32.706 --> 30:35.833
She wouldn't say that.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.293
Kelly.

30:39.296 --> 30:40.671
Come with me, please.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.637
Fractured femur.
We made a traction splint.

30:47.763 --> 30:50.306
He lost a lot of blood,
his pulse is weak, barely palpable.

30:50.432 --> 30:53.601
- He needs a fluid bolus.
- Thanks, we'll take it from here.

30:53.727 --> 30:56.395
- I'm going with.
- You can follow us in another vehicle.

30:56.522 --> 30:57.897
No, I'm riding in the back.

30:58.023 --> 31:01.150
Will you listen to the lady?
I think she knows what she's doing.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.652
You're right, honey. I'm sorry.

31:05.739 --> 31:07.323
I miss Matt.

31:14.081 --> 31:16.707
So, I called over to Denver
on your friend.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.377
Yeah? His insurance is going to kick in?

31:19.503 --> 31:23.965
- It is.
- OK. I appreciate it, Chief.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.302
You should know this.

31:29.263 --> 31:31.973
He was injured in the
Tadisco Warehouse fire.

31:33.308 --> 31:36.894
That is one of the worst fires
Denver's had in the last hundred years.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.732
Ten firefighters died.

32:03.338 --> 32:06.007
I've been doing this for 20 years.

32:06.133 --> 32:07.967
I was a junkie for ten before that.

32:08.093 --> 32:11.012
All that living and learning
is telling me one thing right now...

32:15.517 --> 32:17.143
He's not coming, is he?

32:17.269 --> 32:20.688
Recovery is for people who want it,
not for people who need it.

32:56.266 --> 32:57.350
Where we doing this?

33:06.943 --> 33:09.445
You ever tried Riesling? It's amazing.

33:09.571 --> 33:12.490
Uh, no.
This is a special occasion for me.

33:12.616 --> 33:14.116
I usually drink beer.

33:14.242 --> 33:17.536
Miller Lite mostly,
sometimes Budweiser.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.330
Or Schlitz...

33:20.040 --> 33:21.791
Remember Hamm's?

33:24.002 --> 33:28.214
So, tell me what it's like to be
a fireman. It has to be so exciting.

33:28.340 --> 33:32.385
It's, uh, a lot of adventures, you know?
Fire. Great group of guys.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.763
Women, too, of course.
A lot of homely ones.

33:35.889 --> 33:39.725
Well, Dawson's pretty cute,
in a totally professional, like,

33:39.851 --> 33:41.977
"I'm not even looking" kind of way,

33:42.104 --> 33:45.940
but I just work with them
so you don't have to worry.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.777
But why would you worry?

33:49.903 --> 33:53.114
This is our first date.
I'm not really good at first dates.

33:53.240 --> 33:57.451
- Me neither.
- You kidding me? You're doing great.

33:58.912 --> 34:01.372
My ex-husband always told me
that I talk too much,

34:01.498 --> 34:03.791
so I'm a little self-conscious about it.

34:06.503 --> 34:08.212
So...

34:08.880 --> 34:11.882
What drew you to Golden Oldeez?

34:12.008 --> 34:16.846
Well, I'm very happy by myself, but
I just moved here from Pittsburgh.

34:16.972 --> 34:20.057
And I was reading this article
about prisons,

34:20.183 --> 34:24.019
and the author made a point that
the most severe punishment,

34:24.146 --> 34:26.856
in any culture is solitary confinement.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.984
I mean, we're social animals,
you know?

34:30.110 --> 34:32.319
We need to be around others.

34:32.446 --> 34:34.780
And if it doesn't come easily,
well, then, gosh, darn it!

34:34.906 --> 34:37.158
Just get on a website
and make an effort.

34:39.035 --> 34:41.328
So that's what I did.

34:43.582 --> 34:44.999
I like you.

34:49.921 --> 34:52.298
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.884
- Hey! There she is.
- Hey, Herrmann.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.344
Skinny margarita, right?

34:57.471 --> 35:00.139
- Um, I'll just have a club soda.
- Okey doke.

35:01.433 --> 35:04.268
Is Dawson around?
I've been trying her cell.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.061
Nah, she's in the sticks.

35:06.188 --> 35:10.316
Her and Shay had some
girls' getaway planned.

35:11.401 --> 35:14.612
You know what? Me? My wife, she wants
to go to a cabin with a hot lesbian

35:14.738 --> 35:19.074
for a few days, she's gonna get
an unexpected visit from you know who.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.954
- You're a trip. You know that?
- Yeah.

35:24.623 --> 35:28.083
Hey, you get everything
straightened out with your old man?

35:29.377 --> 35:31.337
Yeah.

35:31.463 --> 35:35.299
I got one more shift at 51
and then I'm transferred to PR.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.719
At least, that's what
his secretary told me.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.888
My dad won't call me back.

35:41.014 --> 35:43.182
PR? Is that what you want?

35:44.935 --> 35:47.520
You know, I don't really know anymore.

35:47.646 --> 35:51.649
It's just not worth it,
trying to fight with him.

35:51.775 --> 35:56.195
Why do you have to? I mean,
why's your old man such a jag-off?

35:58.824 --> 36:04.036
Well, when I was ten, I was
in a car accident with my mother.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.162
She died.

36:07.624 --> 36:10.876
The only thing that reminds
my father of that day is me.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.342
I really don't know what to say
about that, kid, except I'm sorry.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.302
Thanks.

36:20.428 --> 36:24.014
Hey, just remember, though, you got
a family at 51 who really loves you.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.394
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you guys.

36:31.273 --> 36:33.607
- Do me a favor, OK?
- Yeah.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.902
- Tell Dawson I stopped by?
- Yeah, you got it.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.782
Hey, Rebecca, listen...

36:43.577 --> 36:46.787
If you need to talk, I got
club soda up the ying yang,

36:46.913 --> 36:51.250
you just come and park it here.
We'll solve the mysteries of the world.

36:53.837 --> 36:57.256
I got it worked out. Thanks, Herrmann.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.101
- This is a blast!
- You've lost almost $200.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.937
It's the fun of it.
Hanging out, telling stories, you know?

37:12.063 --> 37:14.315
I love playing poker with guys like you.

37:15.025 --> 37:16.901
So, uh, Oxford Stud?

37:17.027 --> 37:18.736
- What?
- You keep changing the game

37:18.862 --> 37:21.071
just when we get the hang
of the last one you wanted to play.

37:21.197 --> 37:23.699
Fine. Five card draw.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.410
- Hello?
- In here, sweetie.

37:26.870 --> 37:29.246
- You're married?
- Yes, indeedy.

37:30.832 --> 37:33.292
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, kitten.

37:33.418 --> 37:36.003
- How's it going?
- I'm cleaning up.

37:36.129 --> 37:37.796
These are the guys.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.758
- Hello.
- Ma'am.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.885
- Carson's ribs?
- Yeah.

37:43.845 --> 37:45.721
Can I get anybody
a beer or anything?

37:45.847 --> 37:47.556
I'm good. Thank you.

37:47.682 --> 37:50.809
Where are the cigars and strippers?
It's poker night!

37:50.936 --> 37:52.311
Have fun!

37:56.107 --> 37:59.276
That's your wife? You, McAuley,
Dr. Doom and Gloom,

37:59.402 --> 38:02.780
- snagged that earth angel over there?
- That's correct.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.824
How many?

38:07.452 --> 38:09.536
You know what? I fold.

38:13.375 --> 38:16.543
Hey, Gabby. I know you're not
getting any reception up there,

38:16.670 --> 38:20.130
but I just, uh... Yeah, I don't know.

38:20.882 --> 38:23.092
It's poker night with the guys, and...

38:23.218 --> 38:27.096
All I want to do is cash in my chips
and go home to you.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.139
Except you're not there.

38:29.891 --> 38:34.478
So I guess I'll just have to stay here
and take all of Cruz's money.

38:36.481 --> 38:40.651
Anyway, I hope you guys are having a
great time, and drive safe and...

38:41.528 --> 38:44.738
Oh, a bunch of new listings
came out this morning.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.824
There's a few places
I think you'll like,

38:46.950 --> 38:50.452
though I've obviously
been wrong about that before,

38:50.578 --> 38:53.831
but we can look at them
when you get home.

38:53.957 --> 38:57.668
Um, I'm sorry about how we left it.

38:59.212 --> 39:02.381
Anyway, I love you. OK. Bye.

40:02.817 --> 40:04.068
Matt?

40:05.695 --> 40:06.737
Hey.

40:08.698 --> 40:10.365
Mmm!

40:14.329 --> 40:17.206
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.417
I'm going to get showered up.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.169
And then I'm going to need
about ten minutes

40:22.295 --> 40:24.671
to put on a little outfit
I've been meaning to break out...

40:24.798 --> 40:27.466
- And then tell you to come in.
- Uh...

40:28.843 --> 40:33.180
Uh, yes, yes and yes.

40:36.142 --> 40:38.227
- Go get a couple beers.
- Done!

40:46.945 --> 40:48.028
Hello?

40:56.871 --> 40:58.455
What's the matter?

41:01.459 --> 41:03.919
Baby, what happened?

41:07.006 --> 41:09.341
- Jones.
- What?

41:10.301 --> 41:12.386
They just found her body.
