00:01.960 --> 00:03.826
<i>This season on</i> The Flash...

00:03.921 --> 00:05.708
<i>DeVoe and his wife
are super-villains.</i>

00:05.797 --> 00:08.756
<i>He created 12 meta-humans
just so he could steal their powers.</i>

00:08.842 --> 00:10.799
This was your team member. Ralph Dibny.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.130
A rookie hero.

00:12.221 --> 00:13.553
I'll save you!

00:13.805 --> 00:14.966
My husband is dead.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.343
I am leaving you, Clifford.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.595
This is an intelligence booster.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.926
<i>Your mind is being rebooted.</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:22.888
The more I try to use my brain,
the sooner I'm gonna lose it.

00:22.981 --> 00:26.145
<i>DeVoe plans to position each
of his five satellites around the globe.</i>

00:26.235 --> 00:28.522
Satellites working together
for a single purpose?

00:28.612 --> 00:31.070
DeVoe wants to remove the
intelligence of everyone on Earth?

00:31.156 --> 00:32.363
"Let there be light."

00:38.413 --> 00:40.154
<i>Hey, this is Barry. Leave a message.</i>

00:41.041 --> 00:42.998
Allen. Captain Singh.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.372
Got some good news about you
getting your job back.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.128
You can thank your wife, too.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.047
Apparently, the Mayor read those
posts Iris wrote about DeVoe,

00:50.133 --> 00:51.669
and she's decided...

01:44.771 --> 01:47.138
- Cisco, we need power!
- Working on it!

01:47.316 --> 01:49.103
Nothing's working.
Not even cell phones.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.400
- It's what I was worried about.
- It's happening, isn't it?

01:51.486 --> 01:53.022
I don't know.
I mean, our plan didn't work.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.775
DeVoe replaced the satellite I destroyed

01:54.865 --> 01:57.152
with the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite
to set off the Enlightenment.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.528
Barr, it's going nuts out there.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.656
I mean, there's no power anywhere.
Our car just stopped working.

02:00.746 --> 02:01.827
Thank God we were close by.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.654
I mean, the hospital's
another three miles away.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.081
The hospital?

02:05.167 --> 02:06.157
- Oh!
- Joe!

02:06.251 --> 02:09.539
Yeah, the sky turned purple,
and she started having contractions.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.620
Cisco, hurry!

02:10.714 --> 02:12.797
If we're not able to get her
to the hospital, can you...

02:12.883 --> 02:15.216
No, Barry can't run her.
It's not safe for Cecile or the baby.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.338
Then what are we gonna do?

02:16.428 --> 02:18.294
I have everything here
I'd need to deliver a baby.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.469
- What?
- Huh?

02:19.556 --> 02:21.047
- Thank God.
- Great.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.552
Um, let's go see how dilated you are.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.805
- Okay.
- Breathe, baby. Breathe.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.302
Hey.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.892
You're gonna wanna see this.

02:30.108 --> 02:33.397
DeVoe must have predicted Harry
would build his own thinking cap

02:33.487 --> 02:36.525
and power it with the dark matter
from this tube.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.065
Dark matter that he could then
siphon off from S.T.A.R. Labs

02:39.159 --> 02:40.149
and use to infect the world.

02:40.452 --> 02:41.693
Harry was his guinea pig.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.863
He knew if he could reboot Harry's
brain, he could reboot everyone's.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.073
What about Gideon?
Could she hack into the satellites?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.829
No, Purple Haze took her out, too.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.294
So, what do we do?

02:54.383 --> 02:55.624
I don't know.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.088
It's okay, Barry.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.427
I think I do.

03:06.436 --> 03:09.804
Look, I love <i>Inception</i>
as much as the next guy,

03:09.898 --> 03:12.185
but sending Barry into DeVoe's mind?

03:12.275 --> 03:14.187
His mind is the only one fast enough

03:14.277 --> 03:16.769
to survive the linking process
without any harm.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.320
Yeah, but how would this
help us stop him?

03:18.407 --> 03:20.239
If we could find the good
left in Clifford

03:20.992 --> 03:22.324
and help it retake control of his mind,

03:22.411 --> 03:23.822
that good could overpower the bad.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.279
You think there actually is good
left inside of him?

03:26.832 --> 03:28.368
I know that this is hard to imagine,

03:28.458 --> 03:30.666
but there was a time
when Clifford was nothing but good,

03:30.752 --> 03:32.163
when he truly wanted to help the world.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.916
It's the dark matter
he infused in his brain

03:34.005 --> 03:35.121
that changed him, so, yes,

03:35.215 --> 03:37.081
I do believe that there is
some good in him somewhere.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.165
We just need to find it.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.544
This is crazy. I mean, why don't we
just call someone we trust?

03:41.638 --> 03:42.674
Kara, Oliver, Wally.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.721
You could bring a legion
of your friends,

03:44.808 --> 03:46.140
but they would pose no challenge.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.765
Clifford created the bus metas
and a combination of the abilities

03:49.855 --> 03:53.189
to ensure that he could defeat anyone
whose assistance you might enlist.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.727
How long until our minds are wiped?

03:59.364 --> 04:01.697
We have until
the permeation grid hits 100%.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.153
How would we get me inside his mind?

04:07.539 --> 04:10.122
We need to find a way to transfer
your consciousness into his.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.915
No, you know what happens
every time I try to vibe him,

04:12.002 --> 04:13.288
I... I can't do it.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.331
I do.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.290
But I don't think it's your power
we need, Mr. Ramon.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.749
I believe it's hers.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.969
This will amplify Ms. Horton's
telepathic ability

04:31.062 --> 04:33.099
to link the Flash's consciousness
to Clifford's,

04:33.190 --> 04:34.522
wherever he may be.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.482
It will also provide a one-way link

04:36.568 --> 04:39.811
so that he doesn't realize
that someone is inside his mind.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.315
So it's kind of like
a one-way brain radio?

04:43.408 --> 04:44.774
I suppose so, yes.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.658
Hey, you hear that, Harry?

04:46.745 --> 04:49.408
That cerebral inhibitor of yours
is gonna be put to good use.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.413
I'm sorry, but your friend, his mind...

04:55.504 --> 04:57.245
"Sorry" won't make him better, will it?

04:59.674 --> 05:01.540
- Everything ready?
- Think so.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.383
Mr. Allen, the chair.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.339
Ms. Horton, the gurney.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.178
You wanna put him in that thing?

05:10.268 --> 05:12.351
It is the only way to establish
a transcranial link

05:12.437 --> 05:14.144
between Ms. Horton and Mr. Allen.

05:15.524 --> 05:16.856
Joe, I'll be all right.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.600
I'll be here the whole time.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.605
We know.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.202
Mr. Allen, put the cap on your head.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.203
Once Cecile has locked
onto DeVoe's brainwaves,

05:35.293 --> 05:37.250
we'll transfer your consciousness
to his amygdala.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.999
That's the part of the brain
that connects

05:39.089 --> 05:40.421
emotional significance to memories.

05:40.882 --> 05:41.998
Where the good memories are,

05:42.092 --> 05:44.425
we will find the good part of Clifford.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.129
Here we go, Ms. Horton.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.369
<i>Barry? Barry?</i>

06:17.502 --> 06:18.993
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

06:29.055 --> 06:30.887
You've got to be kidding me.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.346
<i>Guys, I'm in.</i>

06:38.440 --> 06:40.432
<i>Paint the picture. What do
you see? What's around you?</i>

06:40.525 --> 06:42.357
For starters, The Thinker.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.936
I'm in the 405 bus,
in the middle of the street.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.192
I just came out of
that same portal from before.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.193
<i>This is where it all began.</i>

06:49.284 --> 06:51.446
It is the nexus of Clifford's brain.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.198
Once you find him, get him through it,

06:53.288 --> 06:54.904
and he can regain control of his mind.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.534
Okay, what does he need to look for?

06:57.042 --> 06:58.203
Our house.

06:58.835 --> 06:59.825
All right.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.725
Barry, what do you see?

07:21.107 --> 07:22.314
Nothing.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.187
<i>A little vague
for the viewers at home.</i>

07:24.277 --> 07:25.484
<i>What do you mean, "nothing"?</i>

07:26.112 --> 07:27.478
<i>I mean, it's empty.</i>

07:32.077 --> 07:33.613
It's completely empty.

07:34.079 --> 07:37.572
<i>- All right, well, where should I go...</i>
- Barry? Barry, can you hear me?

07:39.167 --> 07:40.283
Babe, breathe.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.334
Cecile's powers are connected
to her pregnancy.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.163
Her contractions must be putting
a strain on her transcranial link.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.792
No, no, no.
We need to do something about that.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.170
But we can't stop her
from having a baby, Marlize.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.752
We have to, Mrs. West-Allen,
or this will never work.

07:52.055 --> 07:55.139
She is the only way to get Barry
in and out of Clifford's mind.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.137
Everyone chill. It's not like
Cecile's gonna lose her powers

07:57.227 --> 07:58.217
if she has this baby.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.599
Cecile's gonna lose her powers
if she has this baby?

08:01.690 --> 08:03.807
Won't that leave Barry stranded
in DeVoe's mind?

08:04.734 --> 08:05.724
I'm afraid so.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.028
Information you may have wanted
to share, like, way before now.

08:09.114 --> 08:11.401
Joe, do you still have
that inhaler I gave you?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.153
Yeah, it's in our hospital bag.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.200
Okay. Most inhalers contain
the drug Terbutaline,

08:15.286 --> 08:16.822
which can be used
to slow down contractions.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.082
I found Thomas.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.460
He's been this way all the time.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.539
What the hell is that all about?

08:28.633 --> 08:30.169
I don't know.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.922
I'm gonna go get the inhaler.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.173
- Cisco, cover me!
- Yeah.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.429
Guys, we need to tell Barry
where to go next.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.597
And fast.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.051
Harry figured out where Marlize was.
Maybe he can...

08:42.063 --> 08:43.599
Harry?

08:48.361 --> 08:49.693
What are you doing?

08:51.406 --> 08:52.522
Help.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.483
No.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.078
You are not frying away
what's left of you.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.577
Help! Help!

09:03.043 --> 09:04.204
Please.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.901
See?

09:40.789 --> 09:41.905
Nothing.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.581
Ramon.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.672
Where DeVoe
first fell in love with Marlize.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.709
Tell Barry to go there.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.632
You'll find him there.

10:02.811 --> 10:03.892
Okay?

10:06.356 --> 10:07.346
Okay.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.807
And one more thing.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.709
Stars so loud...

10:37.428 --> 10:38.839
Nora shouldn't be here...

10:43.143 --> 10:45.135
I won't lose anyone else today.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.020
I won't.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.608
<i>Harry had an idea. Go to Oxford.</i>

10:56.698 --> 10:57.734
Oxford?

10:57.824 --> 10:59.281
<i>The hamlet of Boars Hill.</i>

10:59.617 --> 11:01.279
<i>The place where we fell in love.</i>

11:01.911 --> 11:03.948
All right, I'm on my way.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.584
All right, I'm here.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.289
Uh, there is a blanket, some wine.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.250
There's a song playing on a car radio.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.923
Our first dance.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.300
<i>And DeVoe?</i>

11:22.599 --> 11:23.806
He's not here.

11:25.476 --> 11:26.512
<i>All right, guys, well...</i>

11:27.729 --> 11:29.140
Where to next?

11:32.233 --> 11:33.440
Rookie?

11:44.412 --> 11:46.995
Allen? What are you doing here?

11:47.415 --> 11:49.748
Ralph? Is that really you?

11:51.252 --> 11:53.118
Hey, man. I thought I lost you.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.671
I... I'm so sorry, man. I...

11:56.966 --> 11:58.457
I missed you, too, Barry.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.463
Barry, did you just say, "Ralph"?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.385
Yeah, guys.
Yeah, it's Ralph. He's...

12:03.056 --> 12:04.217
<i>He's alive.</i>

12:09.062 --> 12:10.553
Wait, how are you even here?

12:10.939 --> 12:12.350
How are you here?

12:13.775 --> 12:16.518
- Did DeVoe... Did he get you?
- No. No, he didn't.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.566
He... It's Cecile.
Cecile's using her telepathy

12:19.656 --> 12:22.023
to get my consciousness
inside DeVoe's mind.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.951
That's trippy. Why?

12:26.037 --> 12:27.949
We need to find the good part of him,

12:28.039 --> 12:30.531
so we can stop the bad
from starting the Enlightenment.

12:30.792 --> 12:31.908
Have you seen him?

12:32.585 --> 12:33.666
A good DeVoe?

12:35.213 --> 12:36.249
No.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.835
Just the evil, floating-chair variety.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.425
He visits me all the time.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.719
He knows you're here?

12:46.015 --> 12:47.005
Why would he need to...

12:47.100 --> 12:50.593
In this place,
I do as I please, Mr. Allen.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.225
I must say, the fact that
you thought I wouldn't calculate

12:53.314 --> 12:55.772
you and your team
making this feeble attempt

12:55.858 --> 12:57.770
is somewhat insulting.

12:58.027 --> 13:01.691
There'll be no defeating the Big Bad
this year, Mr. Allen.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.945
You see, you're in my mind now.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.404
And there's no escape.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.709
Run, Mr. Allen. Run.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.246
Barry?

13:20.425 --> 13:21.586
Barry?

13:22.593 --> 13:25.461
He's coming... He's coming for us.
He's coming for us.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.172
I heard his thoughts.
He's coming. He's coming. Here.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.474
- We need to leave.
- And go where?

13:34.063 --> 13:35.725
Okay, what are we doing?

13:35.815 --> 13:36.931
I'm getting you out of here.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.812
We still need to find
the good DeVoe, though.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.017
- How?
- I don't know.

13:40.111 --> 13:42.819
I mean, he's gonna be someplace
that means something to him.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.693
Before he became who he is now.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.079
You mean, like when he was
a simple history professor?

13:56.252 --> 13:57.584
Stars are raining.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.081
- Got to go. Come on!
- Whoa!

14:03.634 --> 14:04.715
Good.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.926
We are gathered here today
to worship in song.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.553
I suggest "Kumbaya."

14:14.395 --> 14:15.385
Ah.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.187
A force field.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.015
Force field, sucker.

14:19.108 --> 14:23.318
I should never have let you build
this chair without my oversight.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.112
It was my first miscalculation.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.524
You've made many miscalculations.

14:28.659 --> 14:29.775
Really?

14:30.036 --> 14:33.074
Have you ever pondered
why I never pursued the Flash,

14:33.164 --> 14:36.282
never needed his speed or his mind?

14:37.126 --> 14:38.412
Anyone?

14:38.503 --> 14:40.244
His connection to the Speed Force,

14:40.755 --> 14:42.417
access to all of time,

14:42.590 --> 14:46.129
past, present, future, true knowledge!

14:46.302 --> 14:50.763
And now that you have placed him
inside my mind,

14:51.974 --> 14:53.260
I'll have it all.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.802
You'll have to find us first.

15:05.696 --> 15:08.063
DeVoe's lair? Are you crazy?

15:08.157 --> 15:09.989
Can he find us
in this pocket dimension?

15:10.993 --> 15:12.279
I bought us some time.

15:12.370 --> 15:16.364
Time, rhyme, fine, sign...

15:16.457 --> 15:19.291
Cecile, we need you to try
and link up with Barry again.

15:19.961 --> 15:20.951
I'll try.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.632
Professor DeVoe?

15:36.561 --> 15:37.551
<i>Barry?</i>

15:37.937 --> 15:39.144
Barry, can you hear me?

15:39.355 --> 15:41.938
<i>Yeah. Yeah, Iris, I hear you.</i>

15:42.024 --> 15:43.105
What's wrong?

15:43.192 --> 15:44.524
Good DeVoe, we found him.

15:48.656 --> 15:49.646
He's dead.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.620
I don't suppose you have
another plan, do you?

16:05.715 --> 16:07.001
No, man, I mean, I...

16:07.091 --> 16:08.081
This was it.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.710
- Now...
- Now, the world belongs to The Thinker.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.467
Allen, listen to me.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.424
I'm stuck here.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.226
But you're not.

16:20.271 --> 16:21.261
You should go.

16:22.356 --> 16:25.099
Be with your family
for whatever time is left.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.479
No.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.360
No.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.153
Okay, first of all, it's our family,

16:30.823 --> 16:32.234
and I'm not leaving you behind.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.067
There's got to be another way.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.868
Allen, you said
the only way to save the world

16:36.954 --> 16:39.071
is by finding the good
that's left in DeVoe.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.452
He's right here,

16:42.877 --> 16:44.368
with a hole in his chest.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.551
It's not the only good left in him.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.140
Why the brakes? Are we there?

16:59.602 --> 17:00.718
Almost.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.598
So that's the Hellmouth?

17:02.688 --> 17:04.270
That's the nexus of DeVoe's mind.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.769
Marlize said we can take control of him

17:06.858 --> 17:08.316
if the good in DeVoe passes through it.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.270
Allen, we know
that's not possible anymore.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.276
Why do you think he's keeping you alive?

17:13.657 --> 17:15.148
I mean, I couldn't figure it out,
but think about it.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.953
If you get out, you take back control
of this body, because it's yours.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.867
That's why he won't let you leave.

17:21.249 --> 17:23.912
Once you get out,
DeVoe will cease to exist.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.661
All you have to do
is make it through that portal,

17:26.753 --> 17:27.994
and you'll regain control.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.332
Remember who you are, Ralph. A hero.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.139
Let's go get control.

17:44.355 --> 17:47.189
Or how about I kill you?

17:47.858 --> 17:50.475
A second time, if necessary.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.494
- What was that?
- My husband.

18:02.707 --> 18:03.914
He's getting close.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.548
Please tell me someone else felt that.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.092
Apologies. I had to force
an emergency shift

18:16.178 --> 18:18.386
to another pocket dimension.
It can be unnerving.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.715
- Nerving, serving, swerving, curving.
- Hey, hey, hey.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.266
It's okay.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.184
- What's wrong?
- No more labor suppression.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.144
How you feeling, Cecile?

18:27.732 --> 18:29.815
Like... Like I don't know
if I can do this.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.563
You shouldn't have to.
You should be able to have our baby

18:32.653 --> 18:35.191
just like any other parent,
in a hospital, in a regular bed,

18:35.281 --> 18:37.147
not with all this.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.732
Hey, look what you've done.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.826
To our friend, my son, my daughter,

18:42.204 --> 18:44.787
the love of my life,
everybody in this damn city!

18:44.874 --> 18:46.831
- Dad.
- How could you ever think

18:46.917 --> 18:49.159
that this would be better for humanity?

18:49.253 --> 18:51.916
Dad, what did you say to me when
Barry came out of the Speed Force?

18:53.215 --> 18:55.753
You said,
"Strength without faith means nothing."

18:56.385 --> 19:00.595
We need to have faith that
we can get through this, together.

19:10.066 --> 19:13.480
- How long until he finds us?
- Minutes. Maybe less.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.671
Crap in a hat. I can't hit him.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.093
He can read our minds.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.592
- Then we do this Dibny style.
- What?

19:42.682 --> 19:44.298
We don't think. Just...

19:44.850 --> 19:46.466
Fill your mind with something else.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.017
Something you love.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.094
Ralph.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.734
Shrimp buffet!

20:04.829 --> 20:05.990
It's you and me, Iris.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.210
Shrimp platter!
Shrimp cocktail! Um...

20:27.810 --> 20:32.805
Once again, Mr. Allen,
your best will not be good enough.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.395
What's the plan, rookie?
I'm running out of shrimp entrees.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.147
You're only gonna need one.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.984
They're coming every five minutes.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.161
The stars are raining...

20:48.247 --> 20:50.739
Cecile, please just focus
on not having a baby.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.541
Stars are raining,
draining, paining.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.710
He sounds just like Barry when he
came out of the Speed Force.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.879
- Yeah. I know.
- No, I mean, he's...

20:58.507 --> 20:59.998
He's saying the exact same words.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.902
You should mind where you point
your weapon, Detective West.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.154
No.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.925
Stay away from my girls!

21:47.014 --> 21:48.880
Joe!

22:09.370 --> 22:11.407
Hey, <i>Attack of the Clones.</i>

22:11.497 --> 22:12.704
Come and get me.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.884
Hang on!

22:38.899 --> 22:40.231
That was awesome.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.612
Come on.

23:06.927 --> 23:07.917
Now it ends.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.899
No!

24:22.252 --> 24:26.087
How could you beat me?

24:27.841 --> 24:28.831
I didn't.

24:29.510 --> 24:30.500
We did.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.467
Their emotional attachment to Mr. Dibny

24:35.557 --> 24:38.095
have made them stronger
than you would ever be, Clifford!

24:39.186 --> 24:40.393
But then you wouldn't understand.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.688
No! This is not my will!

24:49.113 --> 24:50.649
Not anymore. It's mine.

24:59.248 --> 25:00.284
Whoa.

25:06.964 --> 25:08.500
The numbers are still rising.

25:09.591 --> 25:12.959
Clifford's meta abilities are no
longer controlling each satellite.

25:13.554 --> 25:16.922
If I can just override
their last command. Come on.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.844
There's no more dark energy
anywhere in the city.

26:00.476 --> 26:01.717
We did it.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.976
Oh, my stretchy so and so.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.224
Uh, guys.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.143
My water just broke.

26:12.654 --> 26:13.986
Let's get her to the med lab. Quickly!

26:14.073 --> 26:15.063
Baby's coming.

26:15.157 --> 26:16.238
Oh, boy, baby's coming.

26:16.325 --> 26:17.315
- Careful. Carefully.
- Okay, okay.

26:20.913 --> 26:21.949
Come on, Harry.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.349
Please, tell me you've done this before.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.801
A few times.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.178
- In med school.
- Med...

26:47.940 --> 26:49.021
- Med school?
- Yeah.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.475
Okay. Okay, med school. Okay.

26:51.902 --> 26:56.272
- Joe, just relax. We got this. Okay?
- Yeah. Just breathe out.

26:57.908 --> 26:59.274
Just breathe out.

27:06.416 --> 27:08.408
Power's back on everywhere.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.414
Now, the world can finally
get back to normal.

27:10.504 --> 27:13.167
Landing, standing, tumbling, tossing,
turning, falling, falling...

27:13.257 --> 27:15.294
What happened to him?

27:15.384 --> 27:16.966
He's Enlightened.

27:21.223 --> 27:23.465
Another use of Mr. Deacon's powers.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.221
Technological reincarnation.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.473
- Cisco.
- He's taking over.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.774
I told you that the Enlightenment
will come for you, Marlize.

27:34.611 --> 27:35.601
And it will.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.738
Remember, I thought of everything,

27:40.659 --> 27:42.025
even this moment.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.493
Goodbye, my love.

27:59.761 --> 28:00.922
We're back online.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.675
Not just that.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.469
Sally's in a decaying orbit.

28:13.859 --> 28:16.647
Wait. So Marlize deactivating him
triggered a literal dead-man switch?

28:16.737 --> 28:17.727
It's falling fast.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.608
Clifford must have increased its mass
by a thousand-fold.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.155
Barry, the impact of something
that heavy and that fast...

28:21.241 --> 28:22.357
- I know.
- How much time do we have?

28:22.451 --> 28:23.441
Three minutes if we're lucky.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.743
Okay, how do we stop something that's
gonna send us back in the Stone Age?

28:26.955 --> 28:28.617
Together. I'll spread the word
to evacuate downtown.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.790
Ralph, Cisco, you guys
clear the impact zone.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.583
Barry, you've got to destroy
that satellite.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.834
Okay, now it's time for you to push.
On three.

28:41.511 --> 28:44.629
One, two, three.

28:46.350 --> 28:47.340
You're doing great.

28:54.483 --> 28:55.815
Go that way!

28:55.901 --> 28:57.733
Ma'am, not this way. Take cover.

29:36.066 --> 29:38.149
- Well, what is he doing?
- He's building up speed.

29:38.235 --> 29:39.771
He's gonna use a sonic punch
to destroy it.

29:39.861 --> 29:42.399
Given the satellite's mass
and its escalating descent,

29:42.489 --> 29:44.526
what prevents it from destroying him?

29:55.210 --> 29:56.326
You're doing great.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.537
Now I need one big push, okay?

29:59.131 --> 30:02.624
One, two, three.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.461
Here she comes.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.597
Thank you.

31:51.368 --> 31:52.358
Barry.

31:54.788 --> 31:55.778
Oh, my gosh.

32:38.415 --> 32:40.452
This will restore your friend's mind.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.042
Thank you.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.708
I have a lot to make amends for.

32:50.177 --> 32:51.634
You know, Marlize,

32:52.220 --> 32:54.382
there are still a lot
of metas out there.

32:54.473 --> 32:55.759
I mean, we...

32:56.683 --> 32:57.799
We could use your help.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.510
You have
all the support you need.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.805
There are those, however,
that do need my help.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.769
Before I joined
my late husband's crusade,

33:09.279 --> 33:12.147
I used technology to better the lives
of those who had nothing.

33:12.949 --> 33:16.533
Back then, my mechanical creations
healed the world,

33:17.287 --> 33:18.869
not harmed it.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.076
I'll just pick up where I left off.

33:23.627 --> 33:25.459
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.750
- Good luck.
- Bye.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.260
She risked everything
to try and save him.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.013
She really loved him.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.977
Part of her always will.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.864
What? What is it?

33:56.368 --> 33:58.109
That satellite,

33:59.329 --> 34:02.288
it wasn't just me who took it down.
There was someone else.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.579
Who? Who was it?

34:06.294 --> 34:07.410
Another speedster.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.043
Hang on, Harry.
We're almost there.

34:14.261 --> 34:16.217
Okay. I'm gonna put this on.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.659
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.737
- Is he okay?
- His vitals are stable.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.947
The program completed,
it should've worked.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.790
Hey, Harry.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.958
Hey. Harry!

34:52.674 --> 34:53.710
Harry.

35:00.265 --> 35:01.255
Don't worry.

35:02.309 --> 35:03.925
You have been

35:04.519 --> 35:05.976
and will always be

35:07.480 --> 35:08.516
my friend.

35:10.984 --> 35:11.974
Khan...

35:17.490 --> 35:18.697
- "Heal them."
- "Heal them."

35:24.247 --> 35:25.954
Oh, my God.

35:26.708 --> 35:28.370
<i>Star Wars.</i>

35:29.252 --> 35:30.333
I can't believe it.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.377
- You did it. You did it. You did it.
- Oh, I can't believe it.

35:32.922 --> 35:35.505
It's not every day you translate symbols

35:35.592 --> 35:38.881
into binary
programming polynomials.

35:41.473 --> 35:42.634
I don't know what that means.

35:42.766 --> 35:44.598
Yes, you do.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.676
No, actually I don't.
I don't know what that means.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.262
I think that there's some...

35:49.856 --> 35:51.597
Some short circuits
have been fried up here,

35:53.026 --> 35:54.358
but it's fine.

35:54.778 --> 35:55.859
What are you talking about?

35:55.945 --> 35:58.688
I mean, I just don't understand
the... The thing you said.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.568
It's okay, though.

36:05.622 --> 36:06.908
What's the matter?

36:06.998 --> 36:09.081
- Marlize said this would work.
- It did work.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.159
Ramon.

36:12.545 --> 36:13.786
You did it.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.209
I'm back! I'm here.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.337
I mean, maybe I'm a little more average

36:18.718 --> 36:20.050
than I used to be up there,
but I'm here.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.219
Harry, there's nothing average
about you.

36:22.305 --> 36:23.637
You have seven PhDs.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.924
Well, not anymore.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.263
- I was supposed to fix this.
- What's the matter?

36:29.354 --> 36:32.438
And you did! Ramon.
Ramon, you did. You did.

36:33.817 --> 36:36.059
You brought me back.
You brought back what matters.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.688
So what if I'm... Look, my whole
life, I've been defined by one thing.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.358
My IQ. And...

36:45.328 --> 36:47.240
Somehow, you've given me

36:49.416 --> 36:50.782
a balance

36:51.835 --> 36:56.250
between my head and...

37:03.012 --> 37:06.596
Thank you for the balance, Ramon.

37:09.644 --> 37:12.978
Now, I'm gonna take that balance
to my Earth.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.473
- What?
- Wait, Harry. Harry, we just...

37:16.276 --> 37:17.687
We just got you back.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.356
No, I know, Iris.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.272
But I have to go see my daughter.

37:24.117 --> 37:26.450
I mean,
I might not have the intelligence

37:26.536 --> 37:28.573
to garner seven PhDs,

37:29.414 --> 37:31.781
but I can see one thing clearly.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.036
Family matters.

37:33.960 --> 37:37.124
Well, we're family, too.

37:38.339 --> 37:40.080
Heck yeah, you are.

37:41.301 --> 37:42.417
Each and every one of you.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.381
I'll miss you.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.047
Okay.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.562
- We should probably hug. Yeah!
- 'Cause...

37:58.651 --> 37:59.858
I was like...

38:03.323 --> 38:04.609
We're going to miss you.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.611
- I love you guys.
- We love you, too.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.651
I love you, too.

38:12.165 --> 38:14.999
There could be a million
Harrys in this multi-verse,

38:15.084 --> 38:16.495
but you,

38:17.587 --> 38:18.577
you're one of a kind.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.381
I love you, too.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.353
It's the end of an era.

38:48.535 --> 38:51.073
- There she is.
- Hi.

38:57.126 --> 38:59.618
Hi. Joe, she's beautiful.

38:59.712 --> 39:01.044
Just like her mother.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.876
I think this calls for a toast.

39:08.596 --> 39:09.882
I said this calls for a toast!

39:10.682 --> 39:11.672
Oh!

39:11.766 --> 39:13.257
- Sorry, I was...
- I got it.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.341
Wally.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.973
You didn't think I'd miss my new
baby sister's first party, right?

39:20.608 --> 39:24.443
All right.
To the newest member of Team Flash...

39:25.071 --> 39:27.529
Jenna Marie West.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.944
Welcome to the family.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.024
Cheers.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.368
Nice party.

39:38.251 --> 39:40.117
It's so good to see everyone.

39:40.461 --> 39:43.875
You know, I heard that the Legends
have quite some parties, too.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.126
Mmm.

39:45.508 --> 39:49.001
So, tell me, did you find
what you were looking for?

39:50.054 --> 39:52.296
Yeah, I did. And a lot more.

39:52.807 --> 39:55.220
- I think fighting a time-demon helped.
- Mmm.

39:56.352 --> 39:58.309
But, Dad, look, I left Team Flash

39:58.396 --> 40:01.480
because I felt like I was always
gonna be in Barry's shadow.

40:01.649 --> 40:04.107
But as a Legend, I...

40:04.903 --> 40:07.361
I learned how to be comfortable
just being me.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.943
- I'm so proud of you, son.
- Thank you.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.609
- Let's see your sister.
- Yes.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.242
- Oh, hi, handsome.
- Hi.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.248
Oh, you know, Harry was right.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.960
- This is really all that matters.
- Mmm-hmm.

40:25.006 --> 40:25.996
We're next, you know.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.420
Wait...

40:29.510 --> 40:31.502
What do you mean? You wanna have
a baby now? What do you mean?

40:31.596 --> 40:32.757
- You... Right now?
- Barry.

40:32.847 --> 40:33.883
- What?
- Relax.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.339
- I'm fine. I just...
- Are you?

40:35.433 --> 40:36.890
- Mmm-hmm.
- I just meant someday.

40:36.976 --> 40:37.966
Yeah.

40:38.061 --> 40:40.474
- Not anytime in the near future.
- Right.

40:41.522 --> 40:44.230
Oh, my God.
Let me just get you a refill.

40:44.317 --> 40:46.604
- So you can relax.
- Thank you. That's nice. Thanks.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.275
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:55.370 --> 40:56.611
- We need to talk.
- What?

40:57.997 --> 41:00.455
Wow, this house is bitchin'.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.910
- Huh?
- I think I've seen you before.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.207
Didn't you spill coffee
all over Harry and me?

41:06.965 --> 41:09.378
Yeah, did she pay for yours?
Because she paid for ours.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.049
Weren't you the server at their wedding?

41:11.135 --> 41:12.592
Wait. Yeah, you were.

41:14.180 --> 41:15.762
And where did you get this jacket?

41:16.516 --> 41:17.506
Uh...

41:20.520 --> 41:21.852
From her.

41:23.189 --> 41:26.273
Um, no. Mine...

41:26.526 --> 41:29.109
Mine is a one-of-a-kind, so...

41:30.029 --> 41:33.238
So was this, uh,
when you let me borrow it.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.361
Who are you?

41:37.996 --> 41:42.206
I'm your daughter, Nora,
from the future.

41:42.792 --> 41:44.408
And I think

41:45.586 --> 41:46.793
I made a big,

41:47.755 --> 41:49.212
big mistake.
