[anonymous man]
I can say without reservation

00:26.527 --> 00:31.063
that in the 25 years
in law enforcement,

00:31.065 --> 00:33.298
both as a border agent,

00:33.300 --> 00:37.369
and now with the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms,

00:37.371 --> 00:41.440
I had never seen
anything like it.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.542
New details
expected tomorrow

00:43.544 --> 00:45.677
on the drug tunnel
that was just found
in Otay Mesa.

00:45.679 --> 00:49.048
When a stunning discovery
along the border with Mexico,

00:49.050 --> 00:51.717
a huge drug tunnel
over 800 yards long...

00:51.719 --> 00:54.653
[newscaster] <i> The tunnel</i>
<i> stretching from Tijuana</i>
<i> to the border fence,</i>

00:54.655 --> 00:58.757
<i> then another 500 yards</i>
<i> to a nondescript lot</i>
<i> near San Diego.</i>

00:58.759 --> 01:02.227
We all had been
at crime scenes before,

01:02.229 --> 01:07.199
but none of us had seen
carnage like that.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.501
[man on radio]
<i> The suspect is going</i>
<i> to be close by.</i>

01:09.503 --> 01:11.670
<i> We need responding</i>
<i> officers to lock down</i>
<i> a perimeter</i>

01:11.672 --> 01:13.372
<i> and able to look</i>
<i> for somebody hiding.</i>

01:13.841 --> 01:16.742
[anonymous man]
<i> We got some local</i>
<i> media coverage.</i>

01:16.744 --> 01:20.145
...details
about this drug tunnel,
10News will be there.

01:20.147 --> 01:21.814
[anonymous man]
<i> We got national stories.</i>

01:21.816 --> 01:24.283
One of the most significant
drug smuggling tunnels

01:24.285 --> 01:26.418
between the U.S.
and Mexico
has been shut down.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.520
[anonymous man]
<i> But considering</i>
<i> what happened...</i>

01:28.522 --> 01:30.823
International
organized crime ring
has been busted.

01:30.825 --> 01:32.724
[anonymous man]
<i> The drugs...</i>

01:32.726 --> 01:35.160
...and inside
a massive haul
of cocaine and marijuana.

01:35.162 --> 01:37.563
[anonymous man] <i> The money...</i>
$10 million worth of drugs.

01:37.565 --> 01:40.499
[anonymous man] <i> The guns,</i>
<i> the human trafficking,</i>
<i> the murders...</i>

01:40.501 --> 01:43.602
We are learning what led up
to a San Diego state student
being killed.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.604
10News reporter
Travis Rice has a look

01:45.606 --> 01:49.341
at the medical
examiner's report
and a timeline of the event.

01:49.844 --> 01:52.778
[anonymous man]
<i> The fact that we</i>
<i> lost one of our own.</i>

01:52.780 --> 01:56.448
Two officers
shot in San Diego.
One of them killed.

01:56.450 --> 02:00.619
This is one
of the most difficult
and heart-wrenching situations

02:00.621 --> 02:02.888
for police officers
to go through.

02:02.890 --> 02:06.859
[anonymous man]
<i> What was in the warehouse</i>
<i> was a clear message</i>

02:06.861 --> 02:10.229
<i> to keep your mouth shut.</i>
<i> And it worked.</i>

02:10.231 --> 02:13.499
<i> It worked on the media.</i>
<i> It especially worked</i>
<i> on the witnesses,</i>

02:13.501 --> 02:17.269
<i> and without them,</i>
<i> the case collapsed.</i>

02:21.142 --> 02:26.378
Nobody wants
to speak on the record.
Shit-- even-- even me.

02:26.380 --> 02:32.384
So, it's swept under the rug.
It's locked up
in an evidence room,

02:32.386 --> 02:36.421
<i> never to see</i>
<i> the light of day.</i>
<i> Completely forgotten.</i>

03:28.242 --> 03:32.844
For all the victims
and their families,

03:32.846 --> 03:38.817
I'm glad that you are
doing what you're doing.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.920
They should
know the truths.

03:41.922 --> 03:46.358
They need--
they need to know the truth.

04:06.447 --> 04:12.484
This has everything.
Everything you need
is on this hard drive.

Oh, that's beautiful.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.155
[cameraman whispering]
Yeah, okay.

07:03.157 --> 07:10.762
[cameraman whispering]
Oh my gosh! Steven,
you fucking pervert.

07:11.665 --> 07:15.000
[cameraman whispering]
Steve. Psst.

07:16.804 --> 07:20.872
[cameraman talking]
Stevie. Hello.

[imitating wet sound]

[cameraman whispering]
Oh, that's-- okay.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.055
[cameraman whispering]
That's not coming off.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.026
[pumping sound]

07:43.931 --> 07:45.797
[cameraman whispering]
You filthy animal.

07:49.703 --> 07:53.772
[cameraman whispering]
Oh... Oh, nice.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.221
[cameraman laughing]
What's going on?

08:09.223 --> 08:11.156
[cameraman]
Oh, wakey-wakey.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.095
[cameraman] Oh, man.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.265
Is that necessary?

08:20.267 --> 08:23.768
[cameraman] You look
like a gangbang,
money shot.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.039
And by the looks of it,
you did not score
with Megan last night.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.141
[cameraman] Wow, dude.
You know, unlike you,

08:30.143 --> 08:32.644
I don't aspire to have sex
with every girl
I meet on campus.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.580
[cameraman]
You really need
to re-evaluate your goals.

08:35.582 --> 08:39.717
[cameraman] Tell me, Steve,
are you a closer
or are you a loser?

08:39.720 --> 08:42.587
[cameraman] In the ninth inning,
what are you
going to do?

08:43.857 --> 08:46.892
[cameraman] Put it
in your closer. You didn't
close the game last night,

08:46.894 --> 08:50.028
which means
you did not win.
If you did, she would be here.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.731
[cameraman]
You lost, pal. You lost,
and you know what, dude?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.633
[cameraman] I-- I love you,
but I just can't.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.902
[cameraman]
I can't give you
the room again for another

08:56.904 --> 08:59.170
high-intensity
jerk-off session.
Can't do it.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.972
Okay, winning and losing
isn't dictated

09:00.974 --> 09:02.741
by how many girls
I've slept with, Luke.

09:04.011 --> 09:07.012
What time is it anyway?
[Luke] It's called "scoring".

09:07.014 --> 09:09.047
[Luke] It's almost eight.
Almost eight?

09:09.049 --> 09:11.316
Why the hell
are you up this early?

09:11.318 --> 09:14.653
[Luke] Because we only have
six more days
to finish our final project,

09:14.655 --> 09:16.321
we haven't even
completed the script yet.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.557
No. You mean I haven't
completed the script yet.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.725
[Luke]
Hey, you know what?
It's just--

09:20.727 --> 09:23.662
[Luke] It feels so good
to watch you take on
some accountability.

09:23.664 --> 09:27.132
Oh, fuck you! I have been
asking you for weeks
now to start this.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.833
Now you want
to take it seriously?

09:28.835 --> 09:30.335
[Luke] Yeah. Dude!

09:30.337 --> 09:32.571
[Steve] You'd better
not mess with my settings.

09:32.573 --> 09:33.705
[Luke] Oh my God.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.876
[Steve] Great. You are
such an asshole,
you know?

09:37.878 --> 09:40.078
[Steve]
No consideration
for anybody, but yourself.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.814
Dude, relax, okay?
All I did was
bump up the ISO

09:42.816 --> 09:45.116
because you live like
a fucking cave dweller
in here, man.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.686
I mean it's dark shit.
[camera bipping]

09:47.688 --> 09:50.855
Whoa. What are you doing?
[Steve] Fixing what's messed up.

09:50.857 --> 09:53.625
Oh, okay.
Just don't delete anything
and don't turn the camera off.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.660
I always keep recording.
Don't stop recording.

09:55.662 --> 09:57.729
[Steve] What? Why?
Because half of our grade

09:57.731 --> 10:02.000
is documenting the film.
[Steve] Yeah, Luke, I know that.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.636
[Steve] Duh! So, blasting me
in the face with lotion

10:04.638 --> 10:07.072
at eight in the morning
has nothing to do
with that, does it?

10:07.074 --> 10:09.774
It's funny.
[Steve] Now the battery's dying,

10:09.776 --> 10:11.676
it's going off, like it or not.
No, no.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.714
Hello, everyone. Luke, here.

10:15.716 --> 10:19.818
We are finishing
the final touches
on our film "The Stalker."

10:19.820 --> 10:22.354
It's about this girl
who thinks
that she lost her dog,

10:22.356 --> 10:25.957
but what's really going on
is that this super creepy,
stalker guy,

10:25.959 --> 10:29.628
who can't score with chicks
stole her dog
and tricks her

10:29.630 --> 10:31.796
to meeting up with him
at this secluded location

10:31.798 --> 10:34.899
where he tries to like--
you know, have his way
with her sexually.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.369
And she has
to like fight him off
and stuff like that.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.738
Personally,
I think the story
is really relevant

10:39.740 --> 10:41.740
to the happenings
on campus right now

10:41.742 --> 10:46.244
in respect
to sexual harassment
and things of that nature.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.346
So, let's check in
with Steve.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.750
[Luke] Say "Hi"
to the folks, Steve.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.120
Seriously?
[Luke]
Yes. I'm serious, dude.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.922
[Luke] Part of the grade,
remember?
Behind-the-scene footage.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.258
[Luke] We need this.
So, let's try it again.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.963
[Luke] Say, "Hi, Steve."
Hi, Steve.

11:04.965 --> 11:09.034
[Luke] How's everything doing?
[sighs] Pretty good.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.204
[Luke] Okay. Would you like
to elaborate on that?

11:13.206 --> 11:15.774
Pretty fucking good.
[Luke] Great. Okay.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.443
I got to edit that out,
and that's just
going to be a bitch.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.412
All right, man.
Don't be a team player.

11:20.414 --> 11:21.746
Whatever.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.992
So, how much longer?
Less if I wasn't being bothered.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.161
Oh!

11:40.701 --> 11:42.834
Is somebody angry?

11:42.835 --> 11:44.968
Yeah, I think so.
You know what?
Is your blood sugar low?

11:46.740 --> 11:47.906
Do you need a--? Oh!

11:49.443 --> 11:50.408
A sweet treat?

11:51.845 --> 11:54.112
Do you want
a sweet treat, boy?
Yeah, go get it.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.249
I'm going to make
you work for it.
Come here. Here you go.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.985
[whistling]
Go and get the sweet treat,
little guy.

12:00.987 --> 12:04.789
I know you want it.
Mm, that fluffy donut.

12:04.791 --> 12:08.727
It just wants to--
Just have a little taste.
Just the tip.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.229
Right there.
Just the tip.
Just try just the tip.

12:11.231 --> 12:15.233
You might enjoy it,
you never know. You got
to try everything once.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.402
Am I right?
You're an idiot.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.038
Eat the donut.

12:25.946 --> 12:26.878
[sighing]

12:35.322 --> 12:38.423
Well, I could use
some coffee.
Yup, let's get some.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.460
Here you go, dude.
Oh! Thanks.

12:42.462 --> 12:45.764
All right.
What have we got?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.901
All we got left
is the final scene.
Rad.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.776
A lot of people don't
know this, but these
aren't actually real fish.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.111
You think you can eat
three goldfish
at the same time?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.213
I don't think so,
but you should try it.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.415
Nailed it.
Oh, my gosh.

13:05.886 --> 13:06.918
Oh, look at that.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.394
Dude,
what are you hearing?

13:16.396 --> 13:19.864
What are you hearing?
Yanny, Yanny or Laurel?

13:21.234 --> 13:24.235
Yanny...
Yanny or Laurel?

13:26.239 --> 13:29.274
I'm hearing both, man.
Okay, now he said, "Yanny."

13:38.885 --> 13:40.318
Go get the script
from the printer.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.321
You're done?
Go get it.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.889
Yeah. Okay.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.227
Okay. Yeah, I'm up.

13:51.398 --> 13:52.363
Where's the printer?

13:57.070 --> 13:58.203
This is awesome.

13:58.205 --> 14:02.540
This is awesome, dude.
That fucking
final scene though.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.375
What was wrong with it?
No, I love it.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.377
Awesome..
So, I was thinking
maybe your coach

14:06.379 --> 14:08.580
will let us film
in the athletic
equipment warehouse.

14:08.582 --> 14:11.249
Nope. Nope. Everybody's
going to be filming
on campus, dude.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.084
We got to make
ours more authentic.

14:13.086 --> 14:16.487
But we're required
to shoot on campus, Luke.

14:16.489 --> 14:21.426
Says who?
Professor Scott's
assignment instructions.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.562
[blowing raspberries]
Look, I'm going
to take care of that. Okay?

14:24.564 --> 14:27.966
Let's just focus
on getting some actors.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.536
Yeah?
Sure.

14:32.906 --> 14:33.938
[car honking]

14:43.316 --> 14:45.316
Hello, everyone.
Luke here.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.652
So, today we have started
the casting process
for a film

14:47.654 --> 14:50.421
by hanging these flyers
around campus

14:50.423 --> 14:53.358
in the designated areas
and not to violate
any campus policies.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.628
And, hopefully,
we get some talent
at our casting tomorrow.

14:56.630 --> 14:57.962
Let's do it.

15:00.333 --> 15:04.335
[Luke]
Mm-Hm. Richard Yang.

15:04.337 --> 15:08.539
[Luke] Another Asian math tutor.
No one's going to give
a shit about that.

15:10.644 --> 15:12.210
[Luke]
Speaking of talent.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.314
[Luke] She's so hot.
[Steve] She can hear you.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.150
[Luke] So, what?
It's a compliment. Here,
hold this. Hold this.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.623
Hi, I see you
checking out our flyer.

15:25.625 --> 15:29.093
We're actually casting
a short little horror film
for our class.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.429
You would actually
be perfect
for the leading role.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.699
It's crazy. You know what?
You should come out
and audition.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.200
It'll be fun.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.940
See what I'm talking
about, dude?

15:41.942 --> 15:44.475
You can't be scared
to go talk to chicks.
They're just people.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.245
How do you expect to cast
a hot one if you don't even
go talk to them?

15:47.247 --> 15:50.982
[Steve] Not by harassing them.
That wasn't harassment, dude.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.318
She was flattered.
She smiled. Right?

15:53.320 --> 15:58.089
What you just witnessed,
my man, was pro level
charm and charisma.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.359
[Steve]
Insight into the thought process
of a sexual predator,

16:01.361 --> 16:03.294
truly fascinating.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.363
You know what,
I actually got some
for you today.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.965
[Steve] Oh, yeah?
Just soak that in.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.266
[Steve] Sweet gift.
Thank you.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.203
[Luke] All right.
What do we have here?

16:13.673 --> 16:16.007
[Luke] Oh, [inaudible].

16:17.677 --> 16:21.446
[Luke] Oh my gosh.

16:21.448 --> 16:26.384
[Luke] Natalie is looking
delicious today, man.

16:26.386 --> 16:29.554
[Luke] I mean,
I would bet her rating
I would, one hundred percent.

16:29.556 --> 16:32.490
[Steve] What?
[Luke] Mm-hm.
Full consent and everything

16:32.492 --> 16:36.728
[Luke] Yum, yum, yum.
Give me them yum yums.
Right? Am I right?

16:36.730 --> 16:39.497
You are being
such a pervert right now.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.134
[Luke] Look at your browser
history and we'll see
who the real pervert is, man.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.772
[Luke] Holy shit, dude.
I just had a brilliant idea.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.342
[Luke] She should be
in our film.
What? No.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.611
[Luke] Mm-Hm. Mm-Hm. Dude,
look at her. Look at her.

16:53.613 --> 16:57.648
[Luke] She's like a sex kitten,
don't you want to ride
that ride all day?

16:57.650 --> 17:01.552
[Luke] All day long?
She would look great
on camera, by the way.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.422
[Luke] Honestly, she looks
just like Jessica.
Am I right?

17:04.424 --> 17:07.692
What? No, she doesn't.
[Luke] Are you serious, dude?

17:07.694 --> 17:13.464
[Luke] Look at her hair.
I mean she's got that--
Wait one goddamn minute.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.767
[Luke] Did you write
the character of Jessica
after her?

17:15.769 --> 17:21.772
What? No. No, no.
I did not.

17:21.775 --> 17:24.809
[Luke] Yes, you did. You did!
No. I did not.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.477
Would you keep
your voice down?
Jesus.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.212
[Luke] Give me a flyer.
What? No.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.081
[Luke] Just give me
a fucking flyer.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.383
No, dude.
You're seriously being
such a creep right now.

17:32.385 --> 17:37.155
Seriously. What did we
just talk about
in the quad? Hmm?

17:37.157 --> 17:38.790
What did we just
talk about in the quad?

17:38.792 --> 17:40.391
You got to be
more aggressive, dude.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.494
Chicks dig
aggressive dude, dude.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.264
Not some Beta male.

17:46.266 --> 17:51.235
[writing]

17:59.512 --> 18:02.613
Here, pass that to Natalie,
will you?
No...

18:06.719 --> 18:08.853
[Luke] Keep going.
Down one more.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.591
One more. One more.
One more. Not you.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.560
[Luke]
You're cute though. Hey.

18:17.363 --> 18:19.397
[Luke laughing] Hi.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.403
[Luke] Dude, check it out.
You're in,
one hundred percent.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.873
[Luke] You're welcome.
What did you write to her?

18:28.875 --> 18:31.309
[Luke] Closer shit, dude.

18:32.412 --> 18:36.447
[Luke] Look at that.
I'm pretty sure
her nipples are hard.

18:45.592 --> 18:49.560
[growling]

18:51.164 --> 18:53.731
Nice. What does
this little guy do?

18:53.733 --> 18:56.501
[Steve] Would you
not do that? That is
a 4k Ultra HD camcorder

18:56.503 --> 18:59.370
and it's very expensive.
Cool.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.872
And what is this?

19:02.208 --> 19:05.610
[Steve] That's a secret.
Oh, I like secrets.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.545
Is this
where you store
your virginity?

19:07.547 --> 19:09.547
[Steve] No. No.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.719
No?
[Steve] That'll get us shots
no one else is going to have.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.855
And when did we acquire
this fine piece
of technology?

19:17.857 --> 19:20.925
[Steve] I rented it,
which means I had to put
a $2000 deposit

19:20.927 --> 19:23.294
on the credit card
my dad gave me
for emergencies.

19:23.296 --> 19:26.264
Well,
I think renting
this super-secret camera

19:26.266 --> 19:28.699
for our masterpiece
qualifies as an emergency.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.469
[Steve] Let's get
it back in one piece?

19:31.471 --> 19:33.638
Roger that.
[Steve] Dad is going to kill me.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.407
Hello, everyone.
Luke here.
So, today is a big day.

19:36.409 --> 19:40.444
It is casting day.
And this...
[making clicking sounds]

19:40.446 --> 19:44.282
is the mask
that our antagonist,
the pervert, will be wearing.

19:45.885 --> 19:46.817
Cube shit.

19:46.819 --> 19:50.888
[Steve]
Dude, today's date is
the eleventh, not the first.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.457
[Luke] Yeah, I know that,
and you know that,

19:53.459 --> 19:55.593
but we sure
don't need Scott to know

19:55.595 --> 19:58.296
that we didn't cast
this thing five days
before it was due, yeah?

19:58.298 --> 20:02.466
What if someone tells...
Let me handle the details.

20:02.468 --> 20:05.603
And you worry
about the technical shit.
Okay? Thank you.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.305
Technically,
you're an asshole.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.407
Yeah, well technically,
you might be into dudes.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.775
We're not really
even sure yet.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.422
[Steve] Hello, please say
your name for the camera.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.489
Kelly.

20:25.491 --> 20:27.959
[Steve] How did you
hear about the casting?

20:27.961 --> 20:29.827
I saw a flyer on campus.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.896
[Steve] Whoa, Wait.
You go here?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.366
I'm in your class.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.270
Wow! Um...
Okay.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.738
[Luke] How come I've
never seen you?

20:42.575 --> 20:44.742
Maybe you should
come to class more often.

20:44.744 --> 20:48.879
[Luke] Sure, but you
would've thought we've bumped
into each other at like a bar.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.682
[Steve clearing his throat]
Do you have any
acting experience?

20:51.684 --> 20:56.420
Yes, actually,
I did several plays
in high school.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.623
[Kelly]
And last year I did some
community theater.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.759
[Kelly] I've been busy
this year. I haven't been
able to do any acting,

21:01.761 --> 21:04.762
but whenever I saw your flyer,
I thought it would be
a fun opportunity.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.897
[Luke laughing] It's
a really cool story.

21:06.899 --> 21:09.767
[Luke] Why don't we jump
into the scene?
You're reading for Jessica,

21:09.769 --> 21:11.636
and Steve is going
to be reading for Mark.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.405
Can you give me
a little background?

21:14.407 --> 21:16.941
[Steve] There's this guy...
[Luke] This really creeper guy.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.710
[Luke] He's been following
you, this is where
you confront him.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.980
[Luke] I need you to be
a little scared, a little angry
at the same time. Cool?

21:22.982 --> 21:24.815
Okay.
[Luke] Now, I got to warn you,

21:24.817 --> 21:27.818
this is some heavy shit.
Do you think you can handle it?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.354
I think I'll be okay.

21:39.499 --> 21:42.767
What do you want from me?
[Luke] I want your body.

21:42.769 --> 21:45.670
If you lay a finger on me,
I'll knee you
in your balls so hard,

21:45.672 --> 21:47.471
you'll piss blood
for weeks.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.340
[Luke] I like
your style of foreplay.

21:49.342 --> 21:52.443
I'm warning you,
if you come any closer,
you'll be sorry.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.812
[Luke] I think I'm going
to be sorry
if I don't come.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.947
What do you want from me?

21:56.949 --> 21:58.482
I want your body.

21:59.452 --> 22:04.488
You can have a-- your--
How do you pronounce this?

22:05.458 --> 22:07.758
A pervert.
Pervert.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.627
"Perver."
A pervert.

22:10.396 --> 22:11.796
Pervert!

22:11.798 --> 22:12.963
Pervert!

22:12.965 --> 22:15.099
Pervert?
You pervert.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.867
You pervert.

22:16.869 --> 22:20.104
You can't have it,
you fucking pervert.

22:20.106 --> 22:23.507
Then Mark steps
towards Jessica
and into the light.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.609
[Steve]
He has a ski mask on
and Jessica screams.

22:25.611 --> 22:26.644
Ah!

22:26.646 --> 22:28.879
Ah!

22:28.881 --> 22:31.682
Ah!
Ah!

22:31.684 --> 22:33.517
Ah! [grunts]

22:33.519 --> 22:35.653
Ah!

22:37.657 --> 22:39.056
[Steve] Jessica screams.
Ah.

22:39.058 --> 22:42.927
Ah. Ah!
[Luke] There we go.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.862
Ah!

22:46.933 --> 22:48.833
[Steve] I want
to spice things up.

22:48.835 --> 22:50.968
[Steve] Jessica pulls
a canister of mace

22:50.970 --> 22:54.638
and sprays it in Mark's eye.
Pshht!

23:02.515 --> 23:03.481
[Steve] You got him.

23:05.752 --> 23:09.487
No problem.
Let the pepper spray
burn you, fucking creep.

23:09.489 --> 23:12.022
Oh, fuck!
Ah! Ah, fuck! God!

23:12.024 --> 23:15.726
Let the pepper spray burn
your fucking eyes, creep.

23:15.728 --> 23:19.029
Let the pepper spray
burn you,
fucking creep.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.898
[slowly] No problem.

23:20.900 --> 23:25.169
Let the pepper spray
burn you, fucking creep.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.538
Oh, God, fuck!

23:27.540 --> 23:32.610
Let the pepper spray
burn you,
fucking creep. Khh!

23:37.784 --> 23:41.152
[Steve] Um... Okay,
it's an interesting take.

23:41.154 --> 23:43.521
Send the next girl
on the way out, please.
Thank you.

23:43.523 --> 23:46.457
Thank you.
What the hell?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.827
I-- I--
I don't know, man.

23:49.829 --> 23:53.697
I know a lot of really
slow girls that could read
a lot better than them.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.600
Let's just call
the next girl in.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.537
[door opening]

24:03.443 --> 24:04.175
Oh, fuck!

24:05.011 --> 24:06.777
Just stand on the X?

24:09.649 --> 24:10.815
I'm sorry, what?

24:12.452 --> 24:14.018
I'm supposed to stand
on the X, right?

24:14.020 --> 24:16.587
[Luke] Yeah.
Wherever you're
standing is totally fine.

24:20.059 --> 24:23.861
Steve.
Oh, can you say
your name for the camera?

24:23.863 --> 24:28.466
I mean,
I know your name,
but we know your name,

24:28.468 --> 24:30.468
but can you just
say it for the camera?

24:31.471 --> 24:34.738
Yeah, sure.
Hello, I'm Natalie.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.106
Alright.
What's up?

24:39.812 --> 24:41.679
So, should I start?

24:42.782 --> 24:45.683
Yeah, do you need
any background
on the information?

24:45.685 --> 24:47.918
No.
I was reading it in the hall.

24:47.920 --> 24:53.190
I have a pretty good idea.
Just one thing,
who's reading for Mark?

24:53.192 --> 24:55.926
My good friend Steve
is going to be
reading for Mark.

24:55.928 --> 24:59.063
[whispering] One second.
You do this one.
What?

24:59.065 --> 25:01.899
You read the lines.
I got to operate the cameras.

25:03.069 --> 25:05.269
It's embarrassing.
No, it's not embarrassing.

25:05.271 --> 25:08.606
They're fucking words.
Read them. They're good.
You wrote them.

25:08.608 --> 25:11.809
Is everything okay?
Yeah, we are just grand.

25:11.811 --> 25:15.045
So, we're rolling.
Whenever you're ready,
just go ahead.

25:17.650 --> 25:18.949
What do you want from me?

25:18.951 --> 25:22.253
[clearing throat]
I want your body.

25:22.255 --> 25:24.221
You can't have it,
you pervert.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.957
[Steve] If you-- if you
don't give it to me,

25:26.959 --> 25:30.127
then I'm going
to have to take it
by force if necessary.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.563
If you
lay a finger on me,

25:32.565 --> 25:36.600
I'll knee you
in your balls so hard
you'll piss blood for a week.

25:36.602 --> 25:38.135
[Steve] I like
your style of foreplay.

25:38.137 --> 25:42.873
I'm warning you,
if you come any closer,
you'll be sorry.

25:42.875 --> 25:47.177
[Steve] I think I'm going
to be sorry--
Sorry if I don't come.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.946
You can't have me.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.983
[Steve] If I can't have you,
then nobody can have you.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.021
[Steve]
Mark steps towards Jessica
and into the light.

25:57.023 --> 25:59.156
[Steve]
He has a ski mask on.
Jessica screams.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.925
[pitch screaming] Ah!

26:02.929 --> 26:05.563
[Steve]
Jessica pulls from her
back pocket a canister of mace

26:05.565 --> 26:07.264
and sprays it
in Mark's eyes.

26:07.266 --> 26:11.902
Psst! No problem.
Let the pepper spray
burn you, fucking creep.

26:16.709 --> 26:17.708
What did you think?

26:19.779 --> 26:21.145
I mean, I was into it.

26:22.615 --> 26:23.347
Steve?

26:24.584 --> 26:25.683
She's perfect.

26:26.652 --> 26:31.188
The performance,
it was really cool.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.191
I hope I get to hear
from both of you.

26:40.700 --> 26:44.001
[door opening and closing]

26:44.003 --> 26:46.337
[Luke] Steve's got a boner!

26:46.339 --> 26:50.074
[Luke] Oh my God, dude.
You're getting hard
in the middle of a classroom.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.242
[Luke] Take it easy. Yeah.
This isn't funny.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.712
[Luke] You're going to bust
the camera with your boner.

26:54.714 --> 26:59.316
[Luke] Alright, how many we got?
Looks like... Fourteen.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.919
[Luke] Damn. That's a pretty
little decent turnout.

27:01.921 --> 27:04.021
[Luke] I didn't realize
that there were that many.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.889
Alright. What do you think
about this one?

27:06.692 --> 27:09.960
[Luke] What? Dude, who?
Voldemort's wife? No.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.062
[Luke] If I plan
on summoning a demon

27:12.064 --> 27:14.965
or maybe placing a hex
on my ex-girlfriend,
yeah, we'll go with her.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.867
[Luke] But no,
not for our masterpiece.

27:16.869 --> 27:20.037
She is not that bad.
[Luke] My ass is tanner.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.241
A little startling.
[Luke] What else you got?

27:24.243 --> 27:26.143
What do you think
about this one?

27:26.145 --> 27:32.683
[Luke] Oh, yeah. Ultra babe.
Save her info. I am going
to Instagram her later.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.952
You're such a pervert.
You know that's not
what I meant.

27:34.954 --> 27:37.354
[Luke] Sure, I'm just
wondering when we're going
to be done

27:37.356 --> 27:39.189
playing this stupid
ass charade.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.992
What? What charade?

27:41.994 --> 27:45.062
[Luke] You're acting
like you don't already know
who you're going to cast.

27:45.064 --> 27:48.032
[Luke] How about the girl
you've been crushing on
since freshman year?

27:48.034 --> 27:49.800
What? Who?

27:51.103 --> 27:55.839
What, Natalie?
[Luke] "Who? Natalie?" Call her.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.942
[Luke ] All right, dude. Get it.
Hi, Natalie.

28:00.446 --> 28:04.415
Hey, this is Steve,
from the casting
earlier today.

28:04.417 --> 28:05.949
[Luke whispering]
Yeah, it is.

28:06.986 --> 28:10.220
Um, I'm good.
I'm great. Um, ah...

28:10.222 --> 28:14.792
[Luke] I was thinking about you
and I was whacking off
the other day with my lotion.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.360
Cool. Awesome.
Well, um...

28:16.362 --> 28:20.864
After a lot
of consideration,
we decided

28:20.866 --> 28:23.100
that we would like
for you to be in our film.

28:23.102 --> 28:27.137
Is that something
you might be
interested in?

28:31.043 --> 28:33.243
Cool. Great. Uh.
[Luke making noise]

28:33.245 --> 28:37.481
[Steve]
I'll send you the text
with all the information.

28:37.483 --> 28:38.816
[Luke] Just take it.

28:40.352 --> 28:45.189
Cool. Um, okay.
Well, I guess
I'll see you later.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.857
[Luke] Yeah, she will.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.795
All right. See you.
Um-- Cool, bye.

28:51.797 --> 28:54.064
[Luke] Get it. Get it.

28:54.066 --> 28:57.067
[Luke] You seriously
just asked her
if being in our film

28:57.069 --> 28:59.203
would be something
that she would be
interested in?

28:59.205 --> 29:01.371
Shut up, man.
I choked, okay?

29:01.373 --> 29:05.142
[Luke] In your case,
it's called gag. But you
did it, that's awesome.

29:05.144 --> 29:06.810
[Luke] Great job.
How do you feel?

29:06.812 --> 29:08.345
[heavy exhaling]

29:08.347 --> 29:12.116
I feel good.
[Luke] Like a fucking closer.

29:13.018 --> 29:14.485
What?

29:14.487 --> 29:17.988
[Luke] Give me some knock.
Don't leave me hanging.

29:17.990 --> 29:21.191
[Luke] Pff. Yeah!
Alright.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.762
[Luke] Now, we got
to cast the perv
that's going to rape her.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.002
[Luke] Hello, everyone.
Luke here. Let's meet
our wonderful cast.

29:32.004 --> 29:34.471
[Luke]
This is my boy Quint.
He's going to be playing Mark.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.307
[Luke] Say "What's up?" Quint.
What's up?

29:37.309 --> 29:42.246
[Luke] What's up? And he
is opposite Natalie,
who will be playing Jessica.

29:42.248 --> 29:45.482
[Luke] Look at her.
Just so stunning, right?

29:45.484 --> 29:48.886
[Luke] And that is Steve,
and he is ugly.

29:48.888 --> 29:51.889
[Luke] But we
still love him, and he's
our cinematographer.

29:51.891 --> 29:56.226
[Luke] So yes. Say "Hi," Steve.
Are you done yet? Hm?

29:56.228 --> 29:59.463
[Luke] Mm-Hm. Yeah.
All right.
Come on. Let's do it.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.368
First off, I'd like
to thank you for being
a part of our project.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.570
Of course.
Tomorrow, bright and early

30:06.572 --> 30:08.405
we're going to meet up
right into shooting.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.240
We'll be shooting
at the practice fields,

30:10.242 --> 30:12.209
the cafeteria,
and the shuttle stop.

30:12.211 --> 30:15.145
And then Saturday,
we're going to be
shooting the final scene.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.347
Awesome.
Cool.

30:17.349 --> 30:20.517
I've printed out the scripts
and highlighted
the dialogue for you both.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.452
Stick to the script, okay?

30:23.289 --> 30:26.123
One night to memorize
the dialogues? Jesus.

30:27.593 --> 30:30.327
Aren't you
like ultra-nerd,
Miss overachiever?

30:30.329 --> 30:32.563
Don't you
have the highest grade
in Scott's class?

30:32.565 --> 30:36.033
Oh, shit. You're the one
who fucked up the curve
for everyone else?

30:36.035 --> 30:38.335
Dude, you're going
to be fine. Okay?

30:38.337 --> 30:40.504
We'll feed you
the dialogue
if you forget anything.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.839
We'll take it slow.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.542
Uh, where are we meeting
tomorrow?
At our place.

30:45.544 --> 30:48.946
Yes, the address is
on the shooting schedules.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.216
We're going
to take Luke's car

30:52.218 --> 30:54.251
and we'll all
drive together
in the morning.

30:54.253 --> 30:57.154
Yes.
Drive.
Where are we going?

30:57.156 --> 31:00.157
I thought
that we couldn't
shoot off campus?

31:00.159 --> 31:02.292
Oh! We're going
to be shooting

31:02.294 --> 31:04.428
at this old warehouse
that the baseball team uses.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.029
My coach said
it was cool.

31:06.031 --> 31:10.000
So, yeah. That's that.
Cool.

31:10.603 --> 31:12.903
So, you guys
want to jump
into a read-through?

31:12.905 --> 31:14.972
Crank through it? Yeah?
Let's do it.

31:14.974 --> 31:17.374
Cool. Well,
there's no reason
to have the camera running

31:17.376 --> 31:19.009
if we're just
going to be reading.

31:21.247 --> 31:24.548
[Luke] Where the hell is she?
She just texted me, man.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.618
Said she'll be here any minute.
[Luke] I sure as hell hope so.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.620
[Luke] I mean
it's pretty fucking simple.

31:29.622 --> 31:32.155
[Luke] Stick to the game plan.
Don't deviate.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.524
[Luke] I planned
a full day of shooting
to perfection,

31:34.526 --> 31:37.561
and we're already
behind schedule, before
we even fucking started.

31:37.563 --> 31:40.197
[Luke] I mean
fucking girls, man.
Fucking, girls.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.099
You looked stressed, man.

31:42.101 --> 31:45.502
[Luke]
I just don't like
deviating from the game plan.

31:45.504 --> 31:49.139
You want some?
[Luke] No. I do not want some.

31:49.141 --> 31:52.242
[Luke] I don't smoke that shit.
Maybe you should.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.644
[Luke]
Maybe you shouldn't.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.581
What's that for?
[Luke] It's the camera.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.617
[Luke] It's part of the process.
I got to document
the making of the film.

32:00.619 --> 32:03.453
[Luke] It's part of the grade.
Oh, I forgot about that.

32:03.455 --> 32:06.690
[Luke] Shocker!
Hey, you want to actually
grab a quick interview

32:06.692 --> 32:08.325
while we're waiting around?
Okay.

32:15.434 --> 32:20.404
It looks like it's real
but it's fake. So,
it's not as bad as smoking.

32:20.406 --> 32:23.640
So, you want me
to look here
or like at you or...

32:23.642 --> 32:26.209
[Luke] Just look at me, man.
At you? Okay.

32:26.211 --> 32:30.147
[Luke] So, Quint.
What made you want
to come out to the audition?

32:31.116 --> 32:33.150
Um, Natalie's really hot.

32:33.152 --> 32:36.453
[Luke] I know you're
failing this class.
I'm trying to help you.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.523
[Luke] Don't fuck this up.
Yeah, my bad.

32:39.525 --> 32:43.393
[Luke] Quint,
why did you want
to come out and audition?

32:43.395 --> 32:47.197
Um, I was walking
through the hallways

32:47.199 --> 32:51.468
and I saw a line of girls
in front of the classroom

32:51.470 --> 32:53.303
that you guys
were auditioning for.

32:53.305 --> 32:56.039
Um, and I was like
"This got to be good, right?"

32:56.041 --> 33:00.978
So, I went in and I saw
that they were auditioning
for your film.

33:00.980 --> 33:04.381
And uh, and so,
I stayed for a little bit.

33:04.383 --> 33:09.152
So, I could hang out,
and talk to Natalie and Kelly.

33:09.588 --> 33:14.391
And then you guys came
out and said, "Hey!
Are you auditioning?"

33:14.393 --> 33:18.428
And so, I was like, "Yeah."
And then you guys
gave me the part.

33:18.430 --> 33:22.165
[Luke] Are you fucking retarded?
What, dude?

33:22.167 --> 33:25.535
[Luke] I just asked you
to answer. Are you so high
that your ears are fucked?

33:25.537 --> 33:28.171
Uh...
[Luke] Answer the question

33:28.173 --> 33:31.074
about why
you came to audition.

33:31.076 --> 33:34.177
[Luke] Not about
the fucking poo tang
that you were chasing.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.712
[Luke] Answer
the goddamn question.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.447
All right.
[Luke] Or I'll kick your ass.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.583
You don't have
to fucking yell at me.

33:39.585 --> 33:43.120
[Luke] So, Quint,
what made you want
to come out to the audition?

33:43.122 --> 33:48.392
Um, I needed the credit
for Scott's class so...

33:48.394 --> 33:51.061
[Luke] No, dude.
No, you can't say that.

33:51.063 --> 33:54.498
[Luke] If you want the credit
for Scott's class you got
to act like you're interested.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.800
[Luke] Like you're trying.
Oh, yeah.

33:56.802 --> 33:59.703
[Luke] Help me help you.
Okay, yeah.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.471
[Luke] Just try it again.
Mm-Hm.

34:02.508 --> 34:06.209
[Luke] Why did you come out
to the motherfucking audition?

34:06.211 --> 34:09.446
Um, so, I came out

34:09.447 --> 34:13.250
because I love horror films.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.152
[Luke] Great!
Yeah.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.120
[Luke]
What's your favorite
horror movie?

34:22.061 --> 34:24.661
I don't fucking watch them.
[Luke] Fucking hell, dude.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.097
[Luke] Fucking hell, Quint.
I'm sorry.

34:27.099 --> 34:31.134
[Luke] Uh, oh God!
So...

34:31.136 --> 34:34.504
[Luke] Let's try something
basic. What's
your favorite color?

34:34.505 --> 34:36.572
Green.
[Luke] Great.

34:37.476 --> 34:40.143
[Luke] Well,
it's about goddamn time.

34:40.145 --> 34:42.245
[Luke] Hey, I'm really glad
you could make it.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.380
I'm sorry. I hit
every red light
on the way

34:44.382 --> 34:46.116
and then there was
ridiculous traffic.

34:46.118 --> 34:48.585
[Luke] Which is why I wanted
to leave early.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.254
I'm sorry.
[Luke] Cool, but your sorry

34:51.255 --> 34:52.722
isn't going to make up
for the lost time

34:52.724 --> 34:54.690
which is fucking up
our shooting schedule.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.260
Dude. Chill out. Jesus!
She said she was sorry.

34:57.262 --> 35:00.130
[Luke] I guess I'm
the only one that's taking
this thing seriously.

35:00.132 --> 35:01.665
[Luke] Well,
we'd better get moving

35:01.667 --> 35:05.368
because believe it or not,
we're running behind.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.573
Hello, everyone.
Luke here.

35:09.575 --> 35:12.843
So, despite our late start
this morning,
thank you, Natalie,

35:14.413 --> 35:17.247
[sighing]
we finished all the scenes
we planned on shooting today.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.416
And since we are ahead
of schedule now, we've--

35:19.418 --> 35:22.352
I've decided
that we're going to go ahead
and shoot our final scene.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.421
But before that
we're going to chillax,

35:24.423 --> 35:28.358
recharge our batteries,
and eat some of these
wonderful tacos.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.595
[Luke] Well,
this should be safe.

35:32.197 --> 35:35.899
[Luke] Dude, do you see
this bullshit? C, grade-C.

35:35.901 --> 35:38.335
Oh, shit.
[Luke] Yeah. I know, right?

35:38.337 --> 35:43.573
Hell, yeah. They pass.
[Luke] No, it... [groaning]

35:43.575 --> 35:48.478
[Luke] What did you two get?
Cheese quesadilla.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.414
[Luke] What? No meat?
Yeah, I'm vegetarian.

35:51.416 --> 35:53.183
[Luke] Why am I
not surprised?

35:54.920 --> 35:58.555
The-- like
sight of blood
grosses me out.

35:58.557 --> 36:01.391
[Luke] What about you, cowboy?
What you got there?
Some tacos?

36:01.393 --> 36:04.427
Yeah, carnitas.
[Luke] Yeah, it's probably dog.

36:04.429 --> 36:06.263
[Luke] Have fun shitting
that out later.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.836
[Luke] Hey Quint, you wanna
order me something that won't
kill me in jibberish?

36:14.239 --> 36:16.606
So far so good?
Mm-Hm.

36:17.476 --> 36:18.708
It's pretty good,
actually.

36:19.912 --> 36:20.911
How is yours?

36:22.548 --> 36:25.348
No, no.
Not the food, the shoot.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.918
Oh!
I felt like
I really messed things up

36:27.920 --> 36:30.220
when I was late
this morning.
You were--

36:31.223 --> 36:33.690
No. No, you were fine.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.826
We totally made up for that
time with how quickly shot
that last scene.

36:36.828 --> 36:40.530
You're good.
We're fine.
We're doing great.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.366
You're great.

36:45.504 --> 36:46.770
Thank you.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.244
Can I ask...
The quesadilla...
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.279
No.
You go first.

36:56.281 --> 36:59.216
No, I was just saying
the quesadilla
is really good.

36:59.218 --> 37:00.717
You were asking
and I was...

37:00.719 --> 37:03.520
Yeah,
I'm usually
a little skeptical

37:03.522 --> 37:07.757
about food served out
of a truck, but, no,
these are good.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.392
They're actually
pretty good.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.329
What were you
going to say?

37:13.332 --> 37:16.299
Uh, nothing.
No, say it.

37:20.806 --> 37:23.640
What was it
that Luke wrote
on that note in class

37:23.642 --> 37:25.609
that made you
come out and audition?

37:25.611 --> 37:28.345
What?
What's so funny?

37:28.347 --> 37:30.513
No, he told me
you were going to ask,

37:30.515 --> 37:33.650
and he said
that I couldn't tell you
until the end of the shoot

37:33.652 --> 37:37.420
because he didn't want you
to ruin the film
by being distracted.

37:39.725 --> 37:42.859
That's Luke.
Always looking out
for <i> numero uno</i> .

37:45.731 --> 37:48.598
Well, whatever it was,
I'm glad
you did come out.

37:50.335 --> 37:51.268
Me too.

37:59.011 --> 38:02.846
[Luke] Oh, all right, partner.
Don't hunt yourself
there, cowboy.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.014
[Luke] Let's do this.

38:07.052 --> 38:08.985
[Quint]
Where the fuck are we?

38:10.789 --> 38:14.858
[Luke]
Right. Well hang tight
cause we are just about here.

38:18.497 --> 38:19.963
What's up, dude?
You don't look so hot.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.564
I'm fine.

38:22.734 --> 38:25.969
You're a terrible liar too.
What's going on?

38:25.971 --> 38:29.372
I don't know,
my stomach is just--
it's killing me.

38:29.374 --> 38:33.310
Yeah, it was
probably those seven
rat meat tacos you ate.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.912
I think I'm
a little carsick
or something.

38:35.914 --> 38:38.014
I'm always skeptical
of a place

38:38.016 --> 38:40.684
that has a health
department grade
of a C.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.519
Catch it?
It's not for me.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.654
What? C?
Yeah.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.589
Why the hell
didn't you say anything?

38:46.591 --> 38:50.660
Dude,
there was a big-ass,
fucking C in the window.

38:50.662 --> 38:53.730
You didn't see that?
Ah, you noticed it.

38:55.634 --> 38:57.500
I'll be fine.
Here, hold on.

38:57.502 --> 38:58.968
That's my window.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.038
Feel better?
Yeah.

39:02.040 --> 39:06.710
Alright,
hang tight because we
are just about here.

39:08.714 --> 39:11.414
[gagging]

39:12.851 --> 39:15.886
Pull over.

39:15.887 --> 39:18.922
Pullover. Pullover right now.
What? Okay. Sorry.

39:18.924 --> 39:22.359
[vomiting]
[Luke] Oh, man.

39:22.361 --> 39:27.430
[Luke] Yeah.
Get it all out.
Release the demons.

39:27.432 --> 39:28.798
[Nat]
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

39:28.800 --> 39:31.067
[coughing]
Fine. I'm fine.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.403
[Luke] He's just got
a weak stomach.

39:33.405 --> 39:35.438
Oh. I'm good.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.440
[Luke] Lock it up,
because we're here.

39:40.379 --> 39:41.745
What do you mean
we're here?

39:41.747 --> 39:43.613
[Luke] This is
the place we're shooting.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.716
Come here.
[Luke] What's up?

39:46.718 --> 39:49.018
[Steve] Turn the camera off.
[Luke] No. Part of process.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.521
[Luke] Got to film. Fine.
[Steve] Turn it off.

39:52.924 --> 39:55.725
[Steve] What are we doing here?
[Luke] Shooting the final scene.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.027
[Steve]
You know exactly
what I mean.

39:58.029 --> 40:01.698
[Steve] This isn't some
off-site campus building.
Tell me the truth this time.

40:02.634 --> 40:05.668
[Luke] Okay. I took
a set of keys
from my mom's office.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.971
[Steve]
Exactly what I thought.
You're doing precisely

40:07.973 --> 40:10.673
what you said not to do:
deviating from the plan.

40:10.675 --> 40:14.177
[Luke] What's the big deal?
My mom is the real estate agent
for this building.

40:14.179 --> 40:17.547
[Luke] It's for sale.
I borrowed the keys
so we could shoot here.

40:17.549 --> 40:19.582
[Steve] Without her knowing?
[Luke] Yeah, sure.

40:19.584 --> 40:22.018
[Steve] That is stealing.
[Luke] Stop being a pussy.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.686
[Steve] Fuck you.
[Luke] It's Friday,

40:23.688 --> 40:25.755
the parking lot's empty.
There's nobody here.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.057
[Steve] How do you know
it's empty?

40:28.059 --> 40:31.161
[Steve] You realize
property owners sell buildings
with tenants in them.

40:31.163 --> 40:32.862
[Luke] Alright.
[Steve] See the sign?

40:32.864 --> 40:34.697
[Steve] It says
Mexicali Meat Co.

40:34.699 --> 40:37.734
[Luke] Do you see any beef,
Steve? Tell me.

40:37.736 --> 40:41.438
[Steve] I see you conveniently
ignore the fact that it
also says no trespassing.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.773
[Luke]
We have the keys.
It's not trespassing.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.742
[Luke]
Okay, fine, you're right.

40:45.744 --> 40:48.077
[Luke] I should have
told you that I was
gonna deliver you

40:48.079 --> 40:49.913
the perfect location
for our final scene,

40:49.915 --> 40:51.915
but you would have asked
how I was gonna get in,

40:51.917 --> 40:54.184
then you would have
said no. Apparently,
I was right.

40:54.186 --> 40:56.719
[Steve] I make
decisions that don't
get us into trouble.

40:56.721 --> 40:59.055
[Luke]
The deal was that you
took care of the script

40:59.057 --> 41:02.926
and the technical shit,
and I was in charge
of directing in locations.

41:02.928 --> 41:05.628
[Luke] You use
your daddy's credit cards
to get the cameras,

41:05.630 --> 41:08.565
and I use my mom's key
to get the location.
What's the difference?

41:08.567 --> 41:11.000
[Steve] Cameras don't have
the potential
to get us arrested,

41:11.002 --> 41:13.236
and kicked out of school.
[Luke] Oh my God.

41:13.238 --> 41:16.139
[Luke] Nobody's gonna
get arrested or kicked out
of fucking school.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.508
[Luke] You don't want
to deviate from the plan,

41:18.510 --> 41:21.177
continue to focus
on the technical shit.
I'll worry about the rest.

41:21.179 --> 41:24.781
[Luke] How long is it
gonna take to shoot
this one scene, dude?

41:26.751 --> 41:29.519
[Steve] Setting up the cameras--
[Luke] How long?

41:29.521 --> 41:31.721
[Steve] Half an hour,
maybe more.
I don't know.

41:31.723 --> 41:35.525
[Luke] Cool. Okay, we'll be
in and out in 30 minutes.
Done. Finished.

41:35.527 --> 41:38.628
[Luke] This is an awesome
freaking location, dude.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.997
[Luke] We shouldn't
piss it away
because you're paranoid.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.799
[Luke] I shouldn't
have to convince you.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.934
[Luke] I thought you wanted
this thing to be badass.

41:44.936 --> 41:47.003
[Steve]
It's the ninth inning.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.772
[Luke] Let's close
this fucker out
with a win, yeah?

41:51.176 --> 41:53.943
[Steve] I know
if I don't say yes I'm never
gonna hear the end of it.

41:53.945 --> 41:58.214
[Luke cheering]
Stevie, Stevie, Stevie.

41:58.216 --> 42:01.584
[Steve] Thirty minutes.
[Luke] That's what I'm talking.

42:02.287 --> 42:05.121
[metal clanking]

42:05.123 --> 42:07.257
[Luke] You good?
[Quint] Yeah.

42:07.259 --> 42:08.658
[Luke] Let's go.

42:15.166 --> 42:19.702
[suitcases rolling]

42:19.704 --> 42:23.573
[Luke] Okay,
okay, okay, okay.
See we've got here.

42:23.575 --> 42:25.975
[Luke] Going to the fucking
mystery warehouse.

42:25.977 --> 42:28.077
[Luke] There's got to be
another way in here.

42:29.648 --> 42:31.548
You know what? Let me
drive for a sec, man.

42:31.550 --> 42:34.684
[Steve] Don't touch my camera.
[Luke] Just give me the camera.

42:36.021 --> 42:37.754
[Steve] Do not mess
with my settings.

42:37.756 --> 42:39.222
[Luke] Okay, okay.

42:39.224 --> 42:42.692
[keys jangling]
[Nat] Is there a bathroom?

42:42.694 --> 42:43.893
[Luke] Yeah, sure.

42:44.796 --> 42:45.929
[Luke] Let's see here.

42:49.167 --> 42:51.301
[Steve]
You gotta put the key
actually in the lock.

43:10.021 --> 43:10.987
[Luke] Fuck.

43:23.201 --> 43:25.068
Jesus Christ.
What are you gonna do?

43:25.070 --> 43:26.803
[knocking the door]

43:33.612 --> 43:36.980
[Quint] Kiyah! Ah...
[Nat] Jesus! Are you okay?

43:36.982 --> 43:39.248
[Luke] Nice job,
Chuck Norris!

43:41.252 --> 43:44.287
Will you stop
trying by brute force
the caveman way?

43:44.289 --> 43:47.857
We have keys.
There's probably another door
around the corner.

43:48.627 --> 43:51.160
That's true. Let's walk down--
[Luke] Let's follow the bimbo.

43:51.162 --> 43:54.230
Did I look like Bruce Lee?
[Luke] Yeah, you nailed it.

43:54.232 --> 43:57.333
Hell, yeah.
There's got to be another door.

43:57.335 --> 44:00.637
[Luke]
Well, how about we just use
a perfectly good window?

44:01.106 --> 44:02.905
[Nat] Why would you
have keys that don't work?

44:02.907 --> 44:04.340
[dog barking]
[Nat] Do you hear that?

44:04.342 --> 44:07.744
[Nat screaming]
[Luke] That is a big dog.

44:07.746 --> 44:09.879
[Nat] Oh my God.
[Luke] Hey, buddy.

44:09.881 --> 44:13.149
[Nat] Jesus Christ.
[dog barking]

44:13.151 --> 44:16.386
[Luke] Dog's blessed.
That's-- that's
a big dog.

44:16.388 --> 44:19.288
[Steve] It's like The Beast
from the Sandlot.

44:19.290 --> 44:21.090
[Luke] Shut the hell up,
it's a puppy.

44:21.092 --> 44:22.725
[Nat] That is not
a fucking puppy.

44:22.727 --> 44:24.227
[Luke] Okay,
the dog can't even get us.

44:24.229 --> 44:26.896
[Steve] Come on, this is fucked.
No, it's not fucked.

44:26.898 --> 44:30.066
Look at him. Look at the guy.
He's a cute little--
Cute little puppy.

44:30.068 --> 44:31.934
[Nat] There is nothing cute
about that thing.

44:31.936 --> 44:33.770
He's harmless.
That's a Doberman.

44:33.772 --> 44:36.406
[Nat] That thing is vicious.
You know what, hold this.

44:36.408 --> 44:39.709
[dog barking]
[Steve] Let's just go, please.

44:39.711 --> 44:41.978
[Steve] Dude that's my--
Done.

44:41.980 --> 44:44.280
[dog barking]
[Steve] Really?

44:44.282 --> 44:46.783
[Steve] It's a credit card
my dad gave me
for emergencies.

44:46.785 --> 44:49.318
Yeah. Well, you know what?
It's fulfilling its purpose.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.387
[Steve]
Whats are you gonna
crawl through there?

44:51.389 --> 44:53.256
[Luke] Yeah.
[Steve] Wait, don't do that.

44:53.258 --> 44:55.792
[Steve] Just give my--
[card breaking]

44:55.794 --> 44:58.361
Looks like
your credit card
has hit its limit.

44:58.363 --> 45:01.764
[Steve] You listen to me
for one second. I was trying
to tell you to use this.

45:01.766 --> 45:03.833
Thanks. I'll get that.

45:03.835 --> 45:06.869
[Quint] Alright,
I'm patiently waiting.

45:06.871 --> 45:09.005
[Nat]
Look, it's foaming
at the mouth.

45:09.007 --> 45:12.475
[Nat] He's probably rabid.
[Luke] Oh, yes.

45:12.477 --> 45:14.377
[Nat] Why does this place
have a guard dog?

45:14.379 --> 45:16.279
[Luke] Alright, people.
You guys ready?

45:16.281 --> 45:18.448
Here. In here it goes.

45:18.450 --> 45:22.385
I mean, how?
I don't know,
get on your knees.

45:22.387 --> 45:25.054
I'm not getting on my knees.
You wanna get on your knees?

45:25.056 --> 45:26.456
[Nat] You're such a pain.

45:26.458 --> 45:30.293
[dog barking]
[Luke] You guys hurry up.

45:30.295 --> 45:32.428
[Nat] Eww, I think there's
spider webs everywhere.

45:32.430 --> 45:36.032
[Nat] Oh, God. Ah! I lost my--
Can you help me?

45:36.034 --> 45:38.000
[Luke]
You're a grown woman.

45:38.002 --> 45:40.203
[Nat]
Didn't your mother teach you
to be a gentleman?

45:40.205 --> 45:42.071
[Luke] This is your fault.
[Nat] God.

45:42.073 --> 45:44.173
[Nat] I didn't sign up
for this.

45:56.488 --> 45:57.420
Whoa.

46:01.392 --> 46:03.025
[Luke]
Well, that was exciting.

46:05.764 --> 46:10.032
Okay, trade me.
[Nat] Steve, are feeling okay?

46:10.034 --> 46:12.869
[breathing heavily]
[Nat] You don't look so good.

46:12.871 --> 46:14.437
[Luke] What's wrong
with you? Stomach?

46:14.439 --> 46:17.507
Yeah.
[Luke] Well, suck it up.

46:17.509 --> 46:20.309
[Luke] Here's that,
by the way. Sorry.

46:22.046 --> 46:25.181
You're a dick.
[Nat] What is this place?

46:25.183 --> 46:29.418
[Luke] The sign outside
said meat-processing,
but I'm not sure.

46:29.420 --> 46:34.390
Oh, they probably did
the dog meat for your tacos
from the taco truck.

46:34.392 --> 46:37.927
[Steve] It's not funny.
This is why I'm vegetarian.

46:37.929 --> 46:39.796
[Luke] Hi, Steve.
What do you think?

46:39.798 --> 46:41.931
What do I-- I think
you've got thirty minutes.

46:41.933 --> 46:45.134
[screaming] There was
a huge rat over there.

46:45.136 --> 46:51.207
Oh my God. First the dog.
Now the rat. Can we cool it
with the jump scares?

46:56.948 --> 47:00.349
Okay. These are
the camel harnesses Natalie
and Quint will be wearing.

47:00.351 --> 47:03.119
We are going
to attach a camera
on to this arm right here,

47:03.121 --> 47:05.288
which will give us
some pretty cool shots.

47:05.290 --> 47:07.156
But I've got
something even better.

47:13.431 --> 47:14.564
Ready to see what's inside?

47:14.566 --> 47:15.932
Fuck, yeah.
Sure.

47:21.472 --> 47:22.972
This is the Omni.

47:23.875 --> 47:25.575
Each of its six faces
has an HD camera on it,

47:25.577 --> 47:28.544
so it's designed
to capture footage
in every single direction.

47:28.546 --> 47:31.247
Then its software morphs
the video together

47:31.249 --> 47:34.150
into one continuous
nearly 360 degree view.

47:34.152 --> 47:38.387
It's got autofocus,
low light mode,
stabilization.

47:38.389 --> 47:43.025
And at its core,
its battery will run
each of the cameras at HD

47:43.027 --> 47:45.094
for two hours
on one single charge.

47:45.930 --> 47:48.264
God damn it, Steve.
God damn it.

47:48.266 --> 47:50.533
It gets me so hard
when you nerd
the fuck out like that.

47:50.535 --> 47:53.202
I'm telling you dude,
I came twice.

47:53.204 --> 47:57.073
Okay, so this is the part
where Mark, the pervert
confronts Jessica.

47:57.075 --> 47:59.242
There should be plenty enough
space for the chase

47:59.244 --> 48:01.210
between these rooms
here and these.

48:01.212 --> 48:03.446
We'll give that a shot.
Steve, you want
to add anything?

48:03.448 --> 48:06.215
Ah, let's just run through
the entire scene
a couple of times

48:06.217 --> 48:09.252
and get the hell
out of here. Props.

48:09.254 --> 48:11.354
Quint, here's your mask.

48:11.356 --> 48:13.422
And here's your, Miss.
Thank you.

48:13.424 --> 48:15.591
[Luke]
That's real, okay?
So don't press down on it

48:15.593 --> 48:17.426
unless you want to burn out
Quint's eyes.

48:18.997 --> 48:20.663
I'll get it situated here.

48:22.100 --> 48:27.470
Thank you.
Ah!

48:27.472 --> 48:29.005
[Luke] You're a clown.

48:29.007 --> 48:31.207
Okay, cameras are all on.

48:32.443 --> 48:36.512
Ah. Woah!

48:36.514 --> 48:42.385
[screaming]
[Natalie laughing]

48:47.058 --> 48:48.457
Did you get it?

48:48.459 --> 48:51.394
[Luke] Unfortunately, yes.
We are rolling.

48:51.396 --> 48:53.062
Tight.

48:53.064 --> 48:55.264
Hello, everyone.
Luke here.

48:55.266 --> 48:59.402
This warehouse is amazing,
the perfect location
for our final scene.

48:59.404 --> 49:04.006
Just the right ominous feeling
we need to close out
this masterpiece.

49:04.008 --> 49:07.276
Alright. Hey, guys,
this is a good spot right here.
So let's get set--

49:07.278 --> 49:09.378
You idiot.
What?

49:09.380 --> 49:11.380
It's funny how
you're the only one
to respond,

49:11.382 --> 49:13.716
you must know
I'm talking to you.
Hell, dude.

49:13.718 --> 49:17.954
Did you even bother
just look at the documents
in this folder? Hm?

49:17.956 --> 49:21.657
No.
Okay.
Let me help you out there.

49:22.961 --> 49:24.527
You notice anything?

49:24.529 --> 49:27.463
Maybe the fact
that the building
printed on this page,

49:27.465 --> 49:29.699
the same building
that your mom represents,
by the way,

49:29.701 --> 49:32.401
looks nothing like the building
that we're standing in.

49:32.403 --> 49:35.371
Or maybe
that the company
occupying the building

49:35.373 --> 49:40.476
is called Baja Imports,
not Mexicali Meat Company,

49:40.478 --> 49:43.379
or maybe, just maybe,

49:43.381 --> 49:48.217
that the address listed
on the folder and the keys

49:48.219 --> 49:52.121
says 1801, not 1081.

49:58.529 --> 50:00.363
[Luke] Honest mistake.
I mean, come on.

50:00.365 --> 50:02.331
Oh, honest mistake?
Yeah.

50:02.333 --> 50:05.267
So is that
what we're supposed
to tell the judge

50:05.269 --> 50:07.703
if we're all
getting sentenced
for breaking and entering?

50:10.208 --> 50:12.608
Why do I ever
listen to you?

50:16.347 --> 50:18.014
Because you're
a loser, man.

50:19.217 --> 50:21.617
A minor league
or beta male at best.

50:21.619 --> 50:24.453
And it doesn't matter
how bad you want Natalie,

50:24.455 --> 50:26.789
because you're never
going to score there.
You know why?

50:27.792 --> 50:29.258
Because you're
not a closer.

50:34.499 --> 50:37.066
[man screaming]

50:37.068 --> 50:40.169
[Quint] Oh, Steve,
I hope that was
your stomach, man.

50:40.171 --> 50:42.238
[Nat] Hey, guys..
[Steve] It came from in there.

50:45.376 --> 50:48.711
[man moaning]
[Nat] Oh my God.

50:50.415 --> 50:56.352
[Luke] What the fuck?
[moaning] Help me. Help.

50:56.354 --> 50:59.722
[moaning] Help! Ah...

51:01.059 --> 51:03.592
Please help me.
[Luke] Call the police.

51:03.594 --> 51:06.228
[Nat] I don't have service.
[man] No, no, don't, don't.

51:06.230 --> 51:09.131
You have to go.
Go and get help!

51:09.133 --> 51:11.700
They'll be back soon.
[Nat] Who is coming back, Sir?

51:11.702 --> 51:13.836
[Luke] What the fuck?
[Nat] Where are you going?

51:19.544 --> 51:25.614
[rattling and banging]

51:26.317 --> 51:28.317
[Nat] I don't think
we should move the hand.

51:28.319 --> 51:31.854
No. No. Stop.
Stop! Don't move.

51:33.157 --> 51:36.525
[man] No, no, no.
If I'm gone,
they'll kill my family.

51:36.527 --> 51:38.527
[man] Stop.
Stop and listen to me.

51:38.529 --> 51:40.729
[man] I can't leave.
They have my wife and kid.

51:41.732 --> 51:43.666
[man] Please.
My name is Rick Rosen.

51:43.668 --> 51:46.135
[Rick] I'm an attorney with
the Justice Department.

51:46.137 --> 51:48.838
[Rick] I'm prosecuting
cartel boss
Xavier Montalban.

51:50.675 --> 51:53.542
[Rick] His son grabbed me
and is holding
my family hostage.

51:53.544 --> 51:57.379
[Rick] They want me
to give up our star witness
and prevent him from testifying.

51:58.216 --> 52:03.619
[Rick] Get out of here
and give this information
to FBI agent McClendon.

52:03.621 --> 52:07.490
[Rick] McClendon is
the FBI Bureau Chief,
San Diego Bureau Chief.

52:08.626 --> 52:10.593
Just fucking leave him.
[Rick] I have to stay.

52:10.595 --> 52:13.162
We can't leave him here, Luke.
[Rick] Get out before they come!

52:13.164 --> 52:15.264
Listen to what he's saying.
The fucking cartel.

52:15.266 --> 52:17.766
[Rick] If they find you
here, they'll kill you.

52:22.473 --> 52:25.608
[Rick] Yeah, you have
to get out of here now,
before they get back.

52:25.610 --> 52:28.544
[Quint] The door is locked.
Fuck.

52:28.546 --> 52:30.779
Just let me fucking think.
[door opening]

52:38.389 --> 52:42.691
[garage door opening]

52:53.304 --> 52:57.706
Look at this motherfucker,
rolled his ass all the way here.

53:02.246 --> 53:03.345
Thank you for joining us.

53:05.816 --> 53:07.416
We'll be back
with you in a minute.

53:12.890 --> 53:14.590
[in Spanish]
Come on, further back.

53:28.839 --> 53:30.272
[in Spanish]
Come over here.

53:35.780 --> 53:40.382
[in Spanish]
Guiroz, put it into the truck
and bring it in another one.

53:40.384 --> 53:42.785
[in Spanish] How long?
[in Spanish] Two hours.

53:42.787 --> 53:44.887
[in Spanish] Give us one hour.
[in Spanish] Yes.

53:44.889 --> 53:47.489
[in Spanish]
That's great, quick, come on.

53:50.228 --> 53:52.661
[inaudible]

53:52.663 --> 53:54.863
[in Spanish] Quicker.
[in Spanish] Let's go, quick.

53:54.865 --> 53:57.933
[in Spanish]
Quick, come on, hurry up.

53:59.503 --> 54:02.838
[in Spanish] Wait. Okay, yes.
[in Spanish] Let's go.

54:21.692 --> 54:26.762
[garage door closing]

54:32.303 --> 54:36.005
[garage door closing]

54:36.007 --> 54:37.539
[breathing heavily]

54:39.810 --> 54:42.611
You were going
to leave without saying
goodbye to your hosts?

54:44.448 --> 54:47.783
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
No. That's not very nice.

55:24.989 --> 55:26.422
[sighing]

55:29.727 --> 55:33.462
So,
where did we leave off?

55:50.081 --> 55:53.649
Where is my family?
Right, right.

55:55.486 --> 55:57.586
We were speaking
about our loved ones.

56:04.595 --> 56:05.694
Where are they?

56:05.696 --> 56:10.566
They are close.
They're-- They're safe.

56:11.635 --> 56:12.801
At least for now.

56:12.803 --> 56:16.939
And their continued safety
depends on how
you answer my questions.

56:16.941 --> 56:19.508
Do-- do you
understand that, Rick?

56:22.380 --> 56:23.112
Yes.

56:28.853 --> 56:30.853
I start off
with an easy one, okay?

56:32.790 --> 56:34.656
What would you do
for your wife and daughter?

56:39.864 --> 56:41.997
Anything.
What was that?

56:43.067 --> 56:45.801
I would do anything.

56:45.803 --> 56:48.704
Good. Good.

56:48.706 --> 56:52.007
You see, I have
the very same sentiment
about my father.

56:53.511 --> 56:55.043
I'd do anything for him.

56:56.747 --> 56:58.046
Do you understand me?

57:00.484 --> 57:03.118
You see how far
I'm willing to go.
Don't make me go any farther.

57:04.588 --> 57:05.521
Mm?

57:11.929 --> 57:14.430
Where are they holding
that <i> chismoso</i> , Rick?

57:16.667 --> 57:18.834
I don't know
what that means.

57:18.836 --> 57:20.602
Snitch.

57:22.606 --> 57:24.940
Where is the rat fuck
Marco Catalan?

57:28.846 --> 57:32.147
Don't know.
Where is
Marco Catalan, Rick?

57:32.149 --> 57:34.116
Look,
I already told you.
I don't know.

57:34.118 --> 57:36.785
Why the hell do you keep
lying to me, huh?

57:56.140 --> 57:59.007
Where is
Marco Catalan?

58:04.982 --> 58:05.981
I don't--

58:08.185 --> 58:09.117
I--

58:13.190 --> 58:15.791
I don't have access
to that information.

58:15.793 --> 58:18.794
You're the fucking
lead prosecutor, Rick.

58:18.796 --> 58:20.896
I know you know
where Marco is.

58:26.537 --> 58:27.269
I don't.

58:29.540 --> 58:32.608
I don't have access
to-- to-- to--

58:36.580 --> 58:37.679
Think about my father.

58:40.751 --> 58:42.284
Drop all the charges
against him.

58:42.286 --> 58:48.590
You see, I need one
or the other. I need
my father or his witness.

58:50.594 --> 58:53.695
You give me that I promise,
I will spare the life
of your wife and daughter.

58:59.270 --> 59:00.536
And if you don't,

59:00.538 --> 59:07.709
I'll have 20 of my men
violate your wife
in every way imaginable.

59:09.880 --> 59:14.249
Then I take your daughter
in our place
in a bath full of acid

59:14.251 --> 59:18.086
and I personally watch
as her skin
melts from her bones.

59:19.623 --> 59:20.722
Do you understand me?

59:23.093 --> 59:24.092
Where is he, Rick?

59:29.567 --> 59:30.299
[Rick] Please.

59:31.669 --> 59:32.601
[Rick] Please.

59:49.653 --> 59:51.119
[man] Got to be
honest with you.

59:51.755 --> 59:55.290
In the same way
as my father's life
is in your hands,

59:55.292 --> 59:57.693
so is the life
of your wife
and little girl.

01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:04.066
What we did to you
before it's-- it's nothing.

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:07.636
It's nothing compared
to what I will do to you
if you don't start talking.

01:00:14.078 --> 01:00:16.612
We were
just getting started,
you know, a warm up.

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:23.251
Do you see him?
You know how they call him?

01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:29.324
<i> El Verdugo.</i>
Do you know what it means?

01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:35.197
Alright. Your Spanish needs
a little improvement, alright.

01:00:36.667 --> 01:00:37.899
It means the butcher.

01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:42.971
And that's exactly
what he's going to do
to you and your family

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:45.207
if you don't give me
the information I desire.

01:00:48.879 --> 01:00:49.945
Where's Catalan?

01:00:53.684 --> 01:00:59.321
I don't know.
The U.S. Marshals, they move him
from place to place.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:04.993
There's no way
that I can know
at any given time.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:06.995
Rick, Rick,
Rick, Rick, Rick.

01:01:08.766 --> 01:01:13.869
What we do to you now,
worse will be done
to your family, alright?

01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:16.204
[screaming]

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:20.909
Spare the life
of your wife and daughter.
Spare them this suffering.

01:01:22.212 --> 01:01:25.113
Do you want their hair
dyed in red
with their blood?

01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:31.987
Rick, if you don't tell me
where he is,
you will force my hand.

01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:37.025
I know you feel duty-bound,
but under
these circumstances,

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:39.695
no one will
blame you for talking.

01:01:42.266 --> 01:01:43.231
Where is he?

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:55.177
I-- I can't.

01:01:55.946 --> 01:02:01.717
[screaming]

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:12.260
[breathing quickly]

01:02:16.767 --> 01:02:18.166
That's nice.

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:24.940
Mm.

01:02:27.444 --> 01:02:28.376
Whoa.

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:33.982
"Happy anniversary.
Our love is eternal.
Diane."

01:02:35.519 --> 01:02:40.489
Well, I certainly hope so,
since you both will
likely be dead soon.

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:55.203
Rick.
[whistling]

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:00.442
There you are.

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:03.411
Where is he?

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:13.421
I don't know.

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:17.459
Huh.

01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:20.929
You know what, Rick?

01:03:28.572 --> 01:03:29.571
I believe you.

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:40.348
No. No!

01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:55.063
[hitting the container]

01:03:55.065 --> 01:03:56.998
[in Spanish]
What is that? What is that?

01:03:58.135 --> 01:04:00.001
[noise continues]

01:04:04.908 --> 01:04:06.908
[noise continues]

01:04:10.948 --> 01:04:16.084
[Luke] Oh, fuck! Fuck it!
Please, please!

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:25.060
[Luke breathing heavily]

01:04:25.062 --> 01:04:26.428
Who the fuck are you?

01:04:28.498 --> 01:04:31.967
Speak.
Ah... Ah...

01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:35.203
Nobody.
Nobody.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:38.073
What are you doing here,
Mr. Nobody?
Nothing.

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:41.877
Just nobody
doing nothing, huh.

01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:43.345
What are you
hiding there?

01:04:43.347 --> 01:04:48.550
Look, look, please,
I-- I came here alone,

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:55.991
I'm not gonna say shit,
I'm not gonna do anything.

01:04:55.993 --> 01:04:58.360
Just please--
please, please.

01:04:58.362 --> 01:05:03.164
Huh. You see,
half of that is true.
[in Spanish] Goodbye.

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:07.435
[gunshot]

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:23.418
[Quint panting]

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.487
[man] Alone, huh?

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:39.567
What is this?

01:05:42.172 --> 01:05:43.405
You two trying to rob me?

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:45.040
[Luke] No, man.
[Quint] No, man.

01:06:01.692 --> 01:06:03.491
[in Spanish]
Are you a wrestler or what?

01:06:07.164 --> 01:06:08.129
[in Spanish] Okay.

01:06:15.072 --> 01:06:16.638
We'll deal
with your little bitch later.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.606
I'm gonna deal
with you two first.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.993
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

01:06:37.995 --> 01:06:39.461
[Luke panting] Fuck.

01:06:39.463 --> 01:06:41.997
Who are you...?
[Luke] We're not doing anything.

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:44.065
Who are you...?
[Luke] Fuck you.

01:06:44.067 --> 01:06:47.602
[Quint] We are making
a student film
for school.

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:49.137
[Luke] He's telling
the truth.

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:52.307
Please, man,
please, we are just kids.

01:06:57.581 --> 01:07:00.715
I'm to believe one liar
that vouches
for the other? Hm?

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.490
[Luke] It's just a camera.
It's camera.

01:07:14.097 --> 01:07:16.097
[Luke] Ah!
[gunshot]

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:29.210
[man] Fucking stabbed me.
Fuck you, motherfucker.

01:07:32.282 --> 01:07:36.151
[man laughing]
Fuck.

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:38.486
[man] You two,
can you fucking hear me?

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:48.363
[man]
You were going to stab me?
Motherfucker.

01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:51.833
[man] Look at you now.
Fucking piece of shit.

01:07:55.772 --> 01:08:00.608
Ah... Ah! Mm...

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:06.781
You shouldn't
have brought a knife
to a gunfight, faggot.

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:10.652
And you two out there,
you're dead.

01:08:10.654 --> 01:08:15.090
You're both fucking dead.

01:08:15.092 --> 01:08:20.361
[man] You're both dead,
motherfuckers.
Just like your friend here.

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:11.412
Ah!

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:21.656
[clanking sound]

01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:33.935
[Quint struggling] No!

01:09:39.376 --> 01:09:42.911
No! No!
No! Get off me!

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:48.216
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me! Ah!

01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:53.220
Somebody help me!
Somebody--
somebody help!

01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:58.693
Somebody help me!
No! No, no, no!

01:10:49.512 --> 01:10:52.313
[inaudible] Motherfucker.
[inaudible]

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:08.263
[door closing]

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:33.354
[Nat gasping]

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:39.761
[Nat panting]

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:44.766
[Nat] Shit.

01:11:54.778 --> 01:11:56.311
[door opening]

01:11:58.815 --> 01:11:59.847
[knife sharpening]

01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:11.659
[whistling]

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:36.751
[making noise]

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:41.789
[Nat] Shit.

01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:46.894
[Nat panting]

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.143
[rustling]

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:06.881
Nat, my God,
you scared the shit
out of me.

01:13:08.418 --> 01:13:10.051
[Steve] Are you hurt?
Are you okay?

01:13:11.087 --> 01:13:13.054
Not sure, I-- I guess.

01:13:13.056 --> 01:13:15.423
I found a way
that I think
leads out of here.

01:13:15.425 --> 01:13:17.925
Oh my God, where? We have
to get out of here--
we have to go.

01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:20.728
[Steve] Let's get
Luke and Quint.
They shot Luke.

01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:23.965
Luke?

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:30.538
I'm sorry. I'm pretty sure
they got Quint, too.

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:39.647
[man whistling]

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:50.151
[whispering]
There is a door over there.

01:14:50.153 --> 01:14:54.255
Use the staircase
to go up top, okay?
I'll meet you there.

01:14:55.859 --> 01:14:58.559
[whispering] I'm
gonna run that way
and distract him.

01:14:58.561 --> 01:15:00.795
[whispering] No,
I'm not leaving without you.

01:15:00.797 --> 01:15:05.032
[whispering]
Nat, get out of here.

01:15:06.135 --> 01:15:07.168
[whispering] Come on.

01:16:31.321 --> 01:16:32.320
[Nat] Shit.

01:16:48.338 --> 01:16:49.270
[thud]

01:17:00.717 --> 01:17:03.451
[Nat] Ah!

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:06.186
No. Hey, help us! Please,
you have to get us out of here.

01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:08.322
Shh! Please. Please.

01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:12.126
Please! You have
to get us out of here.

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:16.230
The cartel is trafficking us.
They are gonna sell us
as sex slaves.

01:17:18.735 --> 01:17:20.001
[tinkering with the lock]

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:35.182
That's no use.
We've already tried that.

01:17:36.753 --> 01:17:38.119
What do you want me to do?

01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:41.989
Just get help, please,
before they come back.

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:45.726
I need to get out
of here first.
They're after me.

01:17:45.728 --> 01:17:47.995
Is there a way out?
Yeah.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:50.131
That way--
I can't go back that way.

01:17:50.133 --> 01:17:51.999
God, the other way
is to Mexico.

01:17:53.069 --> 01:17:54.001
Shit.

01:18:13.756 --> 01:18:15.322
You have
to find help first.

01:18:17.293 --> 01:18:18.392
I will.

01:18:18.394 --> 01:18:21.295
Swear it.
I swear.

01:18:27.003 --> 01:18:32.139
[clanking noise]

01:18:32.141 --> 01:18:34.241
[woman] Holy fuck.

01:18:34.243 --> 01:18:39.080
[sharpening knife]

01:18:47.924 --> 01:18:49.490
Run!

01:18:55.231 --> 01:19:01.135
[Steve] Underneath
the warehouse I found
a drug processing lab.

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:08.209
[Steve] Looks to be
hundreds of kilos
of cocaine down here.

01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:12.813
[Nat panting]

01:19:15.785 --> 01:19:17.885
[Steve] It looks like
they also process meth here.

01:19:17.887 --> 01:19:20.755
[Steve] I'm not sure
about what else,
but this must be

01:19:20.757 --> 01:19:23.924
what they're hiding
and what they've
been protecting

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:26.961
and what they shot Rick for.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:36.303
[Nat panting]

01:20:26.556 --> 01:20:27.855
[something falling]

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:35.930
[something falling]

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:48.269
[Nat screaming]
[clanking]

01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:50.170
[man groaning]

01:21:50.172 --> 01:21:56.043
[knife cutting air]
[Nat screaming]

01:22:04.387 --> 01:22:05.452
[Nat] Shit.

01:22:29.545 --> 01:22:32.579
[squeaking in the distance]

01:22:37.019 --> 01:22:40.020
[sliding noise]

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:47.561
[banging and screaming]
[Steve] Nat!

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:56.003
[banging]

01:23:00.376 --> 01:23:02.176
[coughing]

01:23:04.413 --> 01:23:07.381
[running]

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:15.522
[panting]

01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:21.321
[water running]

01:25:11.373 --> 01:25:14.641
[Nat] My friends
have been shot! Yes!

01:25:14.643 --> 01:25:18.178
[Nat]
And he's chasing after me.
He's-- he's trying to kill me.

01:25:21.217 --> 01:25:23.817
[Nat]
Oh no, everybody's dead.
Everybody's dead.

01:25:23.819 --> 01:25:26.253
[man whistling]
[Nat] Please send someone!

01:25:26.255 --> 01:25:28.622
[operator]
We're pinpointing
your location.

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:30.157
[Nat] Help!

01:25:32.428 --> 01:25:33.660
[Nat screaming]

01:25:36.565 --> 01:25:39.166
Help! No!
[slapping]

01:25:40.903 --> 01:25:43.170
You fucking... Ah!

01:25:46.275 --> 01:25:48.509
Get off me, you prick! Ah!

01:25:55.417 --> 01:25:56.717
[belt unbuckling]

01:25:59.788 --> 01:26:03.457
[slapping]
[Nat] Fuck you! Fuck. Ah!

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:10.497
Fuck you! Ah!

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:11.932
[man] Shut the fuck up.

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:25.412
[man moaning]
[Nat crying]

01:26:36.592 --> 01:26:40.794
[inhaling and coughing]

01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:51.205
[Steve] Are you okay?
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

01:26:51.207 --> 01:26:56.877
[Nat crying]

01:27:09.458 --> 01:27:13.293
[Nat] You stupid...
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:27:22.271 --> 01:27:26.740
[Nat crying]

01:27:33.616 --> 01:27:35.015
[Nat screaming]
[man groaning]

01:27:36.619 --> 01:27:40.320
[man groaning]

01:27:45.628 --> 01:27:48.829
[man groaning]
[Steve coughing]

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:57.537
[Nat struggling]

01:28:01.810 --> 01:28:05.679
[man screaming]
[Nat struggling]

01:28:39.915 --> 01:28:43.850
[dog barking]

01:28:44.753 --> 01:28:45.919
[spraying sound]

01:28:48.057 --> 01:28:49.656
Nat, come on. Let's go.

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:08.508
[Steve] I know it doesn't
seem like it now,
but it's going to be okay.

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:12.045
Okay? You said
you spoke with 911.

01:29:12.047 --> 01:29:14.381
The cops should be here
any minute, Natalie.

01:29:14.383 --> 01:29:17.384
We will get
through this. I promise.

01:29:21.457 --> 01:29:22.456
[kiss]

01:29:26.595 --> 01:29:27.894
What was that for?

01:29:30.432 --> 01:29:31.732
For helping me.

01:29:52.654 --> 01:29:54.454
Is what that says true?

01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:58.692
Yeah, it is.

01:30:12.474 --> 01:30:14.174
What the fuck?

01:30:14.877 --> 01:30:16.777
[Nat] I think
there's someone in the trunk.

01:30:18.614 --> 01:30:20.414
Do you see that? Ah!

01:30:24.186 --> 01:30:27.053
Don't you move,
bitch, or he dies.

01:30:29.825 --> 01:30:34.461
Do exactly as I say,
or I'll slit
your fucking throat off.

01:30:36.698 --> 01:30:41.668
Now with your right hand,
your right hand only,
turn the fucking car off.

01:30:43.005 --> 01:30:44.638
[man] Slowly.

01:30:49.978 --> 01:30:50.911
Now toss the keys.

01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:55.849
Toss the keys.
Toss the fucking keys out!

01:30:57.152 --> 01:30:58.218
Good boy.

01:31:01.723 --> 01:31:03.457
[man laughing]

01:31:03.459 --> 01:31:08.462
How is it? Huh?
I bet you like that.

01:31:08.464 --> 01:31:11.665
Yeah. I bet you like that.

01:31:11.667 --> 01:31:17.671
I bet you like
every second of it.
[laughing]

01:31:17.673 --> 01:31:19.806
I bet you liked
every second of it.

01:31:29.518 --> 01:31:31.051
Do you hear me, bitch?

01:31:33.689 --> 01:31:35.589
Oh, I heard you, fuckboy.

01:31:37.025 --> 01:31:41.962
I heard you brought
a knife to a gunfight, bitch.

01:31:41.964 --> 01:31:48.034
[sirens blaring]

01:31:59.014 --> 01:32:00.046
[camera beep]
