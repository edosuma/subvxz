Let's go, Lucas!

00:34.167 --> 00:36.602
- Yeah, buddy!
- Whoo!

00:36.703 --> 00:40.539
- Yeah! Connor, you're up, man.
- No, dude...

00:40.640 --> 00:43.042
- Connor!
- No, I'm thrashed already.

00:43.143 --> 00:45.811
Hey, you are the head of the
house, and there is no exceptions!

00:45.912 --> 00:48.514
No! No exceptions! Go!

00:48.581 --> 00:52.051
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:04.397 --> 01:08.100
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:08.201 --> 01:11.770
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:22.849 --> 01:25.150
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug!

01:25.218 --> 01:28.487
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:31.591 --> 01:32.925
Amazing!

01:33.026 --> 01:35.094
- It's Amanda!
- Amanda!

01:35.195 --> 01:37.329
I love her!

01:37.430 --> 01:39.531
<i>Hey.</i>

01:39.599 --> 01:42.434
Hey, you. What's all the noise?

01:42.502 --> 01:44.336
Oh, I just invited
a few guys over.

01:44.404 --> 01:47.840
You know how it is. Word got out.
I miss you.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.341
I miss you too.

01:49.409 --> 01:52.044
But I'm saving
a lot towards school.

01:52.145 --> 01:53.812
<i>So who's all there?</i>

01:53.880 --> 01:56.915
Just Lucas, Mya,
and a few other people.

01:56.983 --> 01:59.118
I'd better go, but I love you.

01:59.185 --> 02:00.886
<i>I can't wait for you</i>
<i>to get home.</i>

02:00.987 --> 02:02.888
I love you too.

02:05.925 --> 02:08.227
So when does the wife
get back, huh?

02:08.294 --> 02:11.663
The end of the month,
right before school starts.

02:11.764 --> 02:14.600
That's a long time to go without
gettin' something, bro. - Nah.

02:14.701 --> 02:17.536
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Easy.

02:17.637 --> 02:22.107
The host of the party should
always be one drink behind.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.779
That was nice.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.649
So, uh, who invited the skank?

02:30.750 --> 02:34.353
Uh, I don't even know who that is.
Lucas friended her.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.787
You are such an Internet slut.

02:35.889 --> 02:38.390
Oh, come on, Mya.
Give her a break.

02:38.458 --> 02:41.258
She just moved here, and she doesn't know anybody.
Look at her profile.

02:41.261 --> 02:43.428
- Yeah, no thanks.
- Uh, we're almost out of beer.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.898
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

03:15.828 --> 03:18.230
- Need a hand?
- I'm okay.

03:18.331 --> 03:20.051
Let me help you with that.

03:28.107 --> 03:30.976
That's a nice Mercedes.

03:31.077 --> 03:34.913
You know, I've always wondered what
these things look like on the inside.

03:34.981 --> 03:37.883
Can I?

03:37.984 --> 03:39.885
Yeah.

03:44.657 --> 03:46.491
Come here.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.496
God, look at this dash.

03:51.598 --> 03:54.900
- What do all these buttons do?
- What?

03:54.968 --> 03:59.238
Come in. I want you to
show me what they do.

03:59.339 --> 04:02.307
Stop it. Come here. You silly.

04:02.375 --> 04:05.410
Oh, man, that beer bong
is hitting me hard.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.589
Now I know why you
shouldn't drink and drive.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.423
Everything's spinning.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.925
I can make it stop spinning.

04:30.169 --> 04:32.104
- What are you doing?
- Shh, shh, shh. Relax.

04:32.171 --> 04:34.006
No tensing, remember?

04:46.052 --> 04:48.487
We shouldn't do this.

05:24.357 --> 05:27.993
<i>♪ I part the gray skies,</i>

Whoa!

05:37.804 --> 05:39.838
Hey, did you get
your new schedule yet?

05:39.939 --> 05:42.307
- First period, Mrs. Wolk.
- Awesome.

05:42.408 --> 05:45.944
So I get to see you
first thing every morning.

05:46.045 --> 05:47.946
Unless your parents
let me sleep over.

05:48.047 --> 05:50.082
That is never going to happen.

05:50.149 --> 05:52.050
Why? We've been together
for, like, two years.

05:52.151 --> 05:54.986
- I'm practically family.
- What about your parents?

05:55.088 --> 05:57.222
My parents are still
barely talking to me.

05:57.323 --> 06:00.158
Do you blame them? I mean, you
trashed their house with that party.

06:00.226 --> 06:03.028
I didn't plan it. And I swear
that's never gonna happen again,

06:03.129 --> 06:04.963
ever.

06:05.064 --> 06:06.231
Hey, Connor.

06:06.332 --> 06:08.700
Hey.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.470
Uh, who's that?

06:11.571 --> 06:13.905
Uh, just some new chick
Lucas friended.

06:13.973 --> 06:16.241
You know how he is.

06:16.342 --> 06:17.909
You gonna go in?

06:18.010 --> 06:19.678
Okay.

06:19.779 --> 06:22.214
All right, everyone.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.235
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:24.283 --> 06:26.718
Welcome back.
I hope you all had

06:26.819 --> 06:29.100
a fantastic summer vacation,

06:29.155 --> 06:30.856
relaxed, because it's all over,

06:30.957 --> 06:32.858
and the work is
really about to begin

06:32.925 --> 06:36.561
because this is the year
that counts, right?

06:36.662 --> 06:38.830
So, get out your
world history books.

06:38.931 --> 06:40.899
Chapter five.

06:48.508 --> 06:52.677
<i>♪ Come on closer, come and
get it, only halfway... ♪</i>

06:52.779 --> 06:54.646
Oh, here she is.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.748
Heather Henderson.

06:56.849 --> 06:59.384
What school did she go to?

06:59.485 --> 07:02.053
Doesn't say.

07:02.155 --> 07:05.190
Oh, look, and other than
my dumb-ass boyfriend,

07:05.258 --> 07:08.059
it looks like she doesn't
have very many friends.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.462
What the hell is that?

07:10.563 --> 07:12.497
Is that from the party?

07:12.598 --> 07:14.433
Mm. Probably.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.635
But, look, Connor
was so wasted,

07:16.736 --> 07:19.738
he probably doesn't
even remember this photo.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.486
Seriously, you have
nothing to worry about.

07:21.574 --> 07:24.443
Yeah, it's just, I'm late.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.845
"Late"?

07:26.946 --> 07:29.080
- Oh, you mean your...
- Yeah.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.750
I was supposed to get
my period over a week ago.

07:31.851 --> 07:33.718
- Have you told Connor?
- What? No.

07:33.820 --> 07:37.022
And totally freak him out?
Absolutely not. No way.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.460
That's my mom. I got to go.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.929
Okay. Well, call me, okay?

07:44.030 --> 07:45.864
Okay.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.933
Oh, hey, look...
and don't worry.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.835
I'm late all the time.

07:49.936 --> 07:51.736
All the time.

07:54.740 --> 07:58.020
I just don't
understand why it has to happen.

07:58.044 --> 08:00.278
It doesn't mean
anything's wrong.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.016
- Uh...
- What's going on?

08:05.117 --> 08:07.719
Um, your sister had
another miscarriage.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.622
Oh, Kel, I am so sorry.

08:10.723 --> 08:13.792
Yeah, well, I should
be used to it by now.

08:13.893 --> 08:17.295
- Um, are you in for the night?
- Yeah.

08:17.363 --> 08:19.798
Okay. Look,

08:19.866 --> 08:23.702
I really hate to do this,
but I have to go to work, okay?

08:23.769 --> 08:26.104
Um, your dad will be
home later, okay?

08:26.172 --> 08:27.339
I love you.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.975
I love you too.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.910
You know what?
It's gonna happen.

08:33.011 --> 08:34.746
Thanks, Mom.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.881
I know it.

08:36.982 --> 08:38.817
Bye, guys.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.126
Greg and I swore if the last one
didn't take, we'd try in vitro.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.095
What does that mean?

08:50.162 --> 08:52.831
It means I get to be poked
and basted like a turkey.

08:57.303 --> 09:00.038
I just think it's funny how in
sex ed they always warn you,

09:00.139 --> 09:03.208
"Don't have unprotected sex.
You're sure to get pregnant."

09:03.309 --> 09:04.943
And then when
you want to, you can't.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.112
Yeah.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.014
And how are you?

09:09.115 --> 09:10.715
Everything okay
with you and Connor?

09:10.816 --> 09:12.851
Yeah.

09:12.952 --> 09:14.753
Yeah, everything's great.

09:14.854 --> 09:16.888
Are you sure?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.225
Yeah, I don't know.
I just think

09:20.326 --> 09:22.567
maybe I shouldn't have
left all summer.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.243
Headin' out.

09:46.519 --> 09:49.220
Hey, you in there?

09:49.322 --> 09:52.190
Hey, you hear me?

09:52.258 --> 09:54.893
Yeah, Dad. Whatever.

10:19.552 --> 10:22.721
- Hey, Mrs. Walker.
- Hey.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.823
- It's really good to see you back, Amanda.
- Thank you.

10:24.924 --> 10:27.459
- How was the counseling job?
- It was good.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.794
- I made a lot of money for school, so...
- Well, that's good.

10:29.862 --> 10:31.963
Well, I'm not gonna lie.
I wish you'd been here,

10:32.031 --> 10:34.799
'cause then maybe my son wouldn't have
been so stupid as to have a party.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.402
Mom, are you ever gonna forgive
me for that, for real?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.437
Maybe, if I can get that
stain out of my carpet.

10:39.538 --> 10:41.978
Get back to your homework.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.980
Come here.

10:49.081 --> 10:51.716
- What are you doing?
- Making up for summer.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.088
What is it?

10:59.358 --> 11:01.059
Nothing, just this stupid

11:01.160 --> 11:03.261
puppy video Lucas sent me.

11:03.362 --> 11:04.629
It's stupid.

11:16.976 --> 11:20.278

11:29.288 --> 11:31.356
We need to talk.

11:33.059 --> 11:35.560
- Eh...
- Okay.

11:35.661 --> 11:38.163
You go deal with that,
Tom Sawyer.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.144
Nice.

11:45.838 --> 11:48.273
- How do you know it's mine?
- Because I do.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.242
No, there's no way. I mean,
it was, like, one time.

11:51.310 --> 11:52.811
I haven't been
with anybody else.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.747
I just moved here,
like, two months ago.

11:55.815 --> 11:58.650
I don't know anybody.
Except you.

12:00.986 --> 12:02.987
So what do you want to do?

12:03.089 --> 12:06.191
I mean, it's not like this was planned.
And I have a girlfriend.

12:06.258 --> 12:10.061
Well, you should've thought about
that before you slept with me.

12:10.129 --> 12:13.398
I barely even remember what happened.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.834
Hey, you guys, let's
get to class, okay?

12:18.537 --> 12:21.372
I'm keeping it.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.274
Our baby.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.751
Connor! Hey!

12:32.852 --> 12:36.121
Hey! Where were you
this morning?

12:36.188 --> 12:38.757
- Uh, I wasn't feeling well.
- Oh.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.625
Well, did you hear about
that new girl, Heather?

12:40.693 --> 12:42.694
Apparently, she posted a selfie
of her positive pregnancy test.

12:42.795 --> 12:45.296
I mean, that's crazy, right?

12:45.397 --> 12:47.098
If she were actually pregnant?

12:47.199 --> 12:49.467
Yeah.

12:49.535 --> 12:53.471
You know what? I'm just gonna go home.
But I'll talk to you later.

13:04.016 --> 13:05.817
Hey.

13:05.885 --> 13:07.786
<i>Yo, have you seen
Heather's Face page?</i>

13:07.887 --> 13:10.088
Yeah, she posted her pee stick.

13:10.156 --> 13:12.390
<i>No, there's more, Amanda.</i>
<i>Look at it.</i>

13:25.938 --> 13:27.872
<i>Are you looking?</i>

13:27.940 --> 13:30.074
Yeah, I got to go.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.982
Oh!

13:38.083 --> 13:40.483
I've picked you a good daddy.

13:45.624 --> 13:48.426
Shouldn't you be at work?

13:48.527 --> 13:51.429
Seriously?

13:51.497 --> 13:53.832
- Are you picking up where your mama left off?
- Yeah.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.633
Looks like it.

13:55.734 --> 13:58.169
Oh, and just like her,

13:58.270 --> 14:00.551
I'll be out of here
soon enough.

14:36.275 --> 14:38.309
Why didn't you call me back?

14:40.145 --> 14:43.214
- Sorry. I was...
- What? Avoiding me?

14:43.315 --> 14:45.216
What is this?

14:46.952 --> 14:49.020
Hey, Connor.

14:49.121 --> 14:52.757
Hey, I got the blood results back.
I'm for-sure pregnant.

14:52.858 --> 14:54.959
Is this real?

14:55.027 --> 14:57.228
Look, Amanda, I have no
idea what's going on.

14:57.329 --> 14:59.030
You obviously slept with her.
Or is she just lying?

14:59.131 --> 15:01.032
- I'm not lying.
- Shut up.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.140
Look, I'm not the one who
cheated on his girlfriend.

15:03.168 --> 15:05.568
I didn't even know
he had a girlfriend.

15:06.672 --> 15:08.373
Amanda, can we just
talk about this?

15:08.474 --> 15:11.609
No, you have no idea
how bad you just screwed up.

15:30.829 --> 15:32.597
Amanda!

15:33.933 --> 15:36.234
I can't believe this!

15:37.569 --> 15:39.871
How could he?

15:39.972 --> 15:43.741
I-I know, but maybe it's
not as bad as it seems.

15:43.842 --> 15:46.282
I mean, people make
mistakes, right?

15:46.312 --> 15:48.313
You guys have been
together for two years.

15:48.414 --> 15:51.294
- Maybe you can get through this.
- I don't think so.

15:54.253 --> 15:56.087
I'm pregnant too!

- Look, Amanda,

16:35.260 --> 16:38.563
I don't even know how
to say how sorry I am.

16:38.630 --> 16:42.133
I mean, I don't know
what I was thinking.

16:42.234 --> 16:45.603
To be honest, I barely even
remember what happened.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.551
- So you're gonna blame it on being drunk?
- No.

16:47.606 --> 16:50.108
No, it was totally
and completely my fault.

16:50.209 --> 16:53.689
And now I just hate
myself for all of it.

16:55.581 --> 16:58.516
Especially what
it's done to you.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.286
To us.

17:03.589 --> 17:06.290
There is no more "us," Connor.

17:06.392 --> 17:08.673
You took care of that the night
that you got her pregnant.

<i>♪ You just disappear ♪</i>

17:23.876 --> 17:25.643
You should eat, sweetie.

17:25.743 --> 17:27.412
You look pale.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.180
I'm fine.

17:50.202 --> 17:52.270
I'm not gonna stop texting

17:52.337 --> 17:55.106
or calling you, Amanda.

17:55.207 --> 17:56.507
Okay, I know we can
get through this.

17:56.608 --> 17:58.709
Mr. Walker, is there a problem?

17:58.811 --> 18:00.845
Yes, Mrs. Wolk, there is.

18:00.946 --> 18:03.848
In fact, can I switch
seats, please?

18:03.949 --> 18:06.317
I'll switch with her.

18:06.418 --> 18:10.655
All right, all right. Amanda,
Heather, switch seats.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.116
But if I have any more disturbances,
I'm gonna move you all.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.926
"Ooh!"

18:15.027 --> 18:16.961
She's all yours.

18:17.062 --> 18:19.564
Amanda...

18:46.425 --> 18:48.559
- Have you talked to your parents yet?
- No.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.529
- Why not? I'm already eight weeks.
- Because they'll kill me.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.731
Look, they'll get over it. And then
they'll meet their grandchild,

18:53.799 --> 18:56.200
and they'll be so happy,
just like we'll be.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.470
Have you told your parents?

18:59.538 --> 19:01.172
My mom's not around.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.753
She walked out on us,
like, four years ago.

19:04.743 --> 19:07.078
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

19:07.179 --> 19:10.148
And my dad... he doesn't
care what I do.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.450
And even if I did tell him,
he wouldn't help out.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.452
He wouldn't buy me
any maternity clothes,

19:14.553 --> 19:16.554
so what am I supposed to wear?

19:16.622 --> 19:19.582
I can't even see a doctor because
we don't have insurance.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.692
And I sure as hell can't
afford it on my own.

19:21.793 --> 19:23.728
And I didn't want
to say anything,

19:23.795 --> 19:25.396
but I'm really worried
about this baby.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.266
I'm trying to do
everything right,

19:28.367 --> 19:30.034
but I have no one.

19:30.102 --> 19:33.004
No one is there to help me.

19:33.071 --> 19:35.940
Look, I'll take care
of it, okay?

19:36.041 --> 19:39.110
I have some money saved up.
You can use it for a doctor

19:39.178 --> 19:41.112
so you and the baby
can get checked out.

19:41.213 --> 19:44.282
Oh, thanks! I knew
you'd take care of us!

20:17.015 --> 20:18.695
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

20:18.784 --> 20:21.819
Hey, sweetie.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.854
Hey.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.990
What?

20:26.058 --> 20:28.626
Is there something
you want to tell us?

20:28.727 --> 20:31.762
- No. Why?
- Oh, I don't know.

20:31.863 --> 20:35.399
Maybe the fact that you
don't eat a lot these days,

20:35.500 --> 20:39.070
you don't sleep very much,
you cry a lot.

20:39.137 --> 20:41.572
I'm okay. I just have
been really busy.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.753
A little tired, is all.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.156
I thought we were
being safe. I swear.

20:59.224 --> 21:01.158
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.927
Amanda, do you have any idea

21:03.028 --> 21:05.863
what this is gonna do to
your life, to your future?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.164
You're only 17.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.900
You haven't even
finished high school.

21:09.968 --> 21:12.970
And what about college? Or did
you just forget about that?

21:13.071 --> 21:15.539
I didn't do this on purpose.

21:15.641 --> 21:18.776
I don't even know
what I'm gonna do.

21:20.145 --> 21:21.679
I mean, Mom's right.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.115
If I keep the baby,
it changes everything.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.336
No, no, wait a second.

21:26.418 --> 21:28.986
I did not mean to suggest that
you shouldn't have this baby.

21:29.054 --> 21:30.888
But you did make
a mistake, Amanda.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.924
Look, you do need to take
some responsibility here.

21:33.992 --> 21:36.994
She obviously can't go to school and
raise the baby at the same time.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.936
Okay. No, she cannot.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.532
But she also has her parents.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.467
Right?

21:43.568 --> 21:45.603
You have both of your
parents here to help you.

21:45.704 --> 21:48.439
Do you know

21:48.507 --> 21:50.341
that when I was 19,

21:50.442 --> 21:54.745
your father and I had to make
the exact same decision?

21:54.846 --> 21:57.315
And do you know
how grateful I am

21:57.382 --> 22:01.385
every single day that I get to look
into your sister's smiling face...

22:03.355 --> 22:05.456
and yours.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.693
Dad?

22:11.530 --> 22:14.298
Obviously, this is not
what I wanted, Amanda.

22:17.469 --> 22:19.270
But your mother's right.

22:20.639 --> 22:22.506
Come here.

22:30.182 --> 22:34.885
Look, I'm sure that you
and Connor are terrified,

22:34.986 --> 22:36.887
but just know that
we will be there for you,

22:36.988 --> 22:38.756
and we will get
through this together.

22:38.857 --> 22:42.126
Connor doesn't know.
I haven't told him.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.895
Why? Amanda, this is his baby.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.164
He deserves to know.

22:47.265 --> 22:50.000
He cheated on me, Mom.

22:52.471 --> 22:54.871
And she's pregnant too.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.878
What?

23:11.823 --> 23:13.924
Amanda, your father and I

23:13.992 --> 23:16.360
have decided to go over to
Connor's and talk to his parents.

23:16.428 --> 23:20.197
- Now?
- And we would like for you to come with us.

23:20.265 --> 23:22.466
You did talk to Connor, right? Because
his parents didn't mention anything.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.302
Yeah. He just probably
hasn't told them.

23:25.370 --> 23:28.105
Okay. You might want to give them
a heads-up that we're coming.

23:28.206 --> 23:30.007
Okay.

23:39.751 --> 23:43.020
We had the greatest summer,
as I said, but we missed you.

23:43.121 --> 23:45.589
- The vineyard was spectacular. You have to come next time.
- We'd love to.

23:45.690 --> 23:49.026
And this pinot is phenomenal.
I mean, wait till you taste it.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.929
But anyway, enough about us.
So, uh, how are things?

23:52.030 --> 23:54.498
Well, actually,
that's why we're here.

23:54.566 --> 23:57.868
Amanda and Connor have something
they want to discuss with us.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.805
Oh, what is it?

24:03.842 --> 24:05.276
Amanda.

24:06.311 --> 24:08.946
I'm pregnant.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.716
Unbelievable.

24:12.818 --> 24:15.186
Connor, you didn't think that
maybe you should've told us?

24:15.287 --> 24:17.855
I didn't know about it until
just before they came over.

24:17.923 --> 24:21.592
- Tt?
- It's true.

24:21.660 --> 24:24.662
- I don't understand this. Weren't you being safe?
- Yeah, we were.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.831
At least, I thought we were.

24:26.932 --> 24:28.732
- Well, one of you wasn't.
- Wait a second.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.701
In all fairness, even if they
were taking precautions,

24:30.769 --> 24:33.089
we all know something
like this can still happen.

24:33.104 --> 24:36.574
Okay, okay, let's not all get
worked up about this, okay?

24:36.675 --> 24:39.543
I mean, there is
a way to handle this.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.612
Right?

24:41.680 --> 24:45.583
I'm keeping the baby,
if that's what you mean.

24:50.388 --> 24:53.791
And there's more.

24:53.859 --> 24:56.060
There's a girl at school who's
also claiming she's pregnant

24:56.161 --> 24:58.128
with Connor's baby.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.833
What is this, a joke? Is
this some kind of damn joke?

25:02.934 --> 25:05.336
It's true.

25:05.403 --> 25:08.005
Connor, I don't
understand any of it.

25:08.073 --> 25:10.913
- How could this happen?
- I'll tell you how it could happen.

25:10.976 --> 25:13.611
This is some kind of sick
game these girls are playing.

25:13.712 --> 25:16.814
Now, wait a second. It's your
son who screwed around here.

25:16.882 --> 25:20.351
- It does take two, Peter.
- Connor, I don't understand this.

25:20.452 --> 25:22.686
Who is this girl?
What's her name?

25:22.787 --> 25:25.656
Her name's Heather. I don't even know her.
I met her...

25:25.757 --> 25:28.259
Whoa, wait a second!

25:28.360 --> 25:30.327
What do you mean, you don't know her?
It doesn't sound like it.

25:30.428 --> 25:32.589
You know what?
What if you just calm down?

25:32.631 --> 25:34.865
You still think we shouldn't
have sent him to private school?

25:34.966 --> 25:37.902
- Away from these...
- What, Peter? Away from what?

25:38.003 --> 25:40.871
Hey, look. My son's
life is ruined, Jeff.

25:40.939 --> 25:44.375
- You know, this is not just about Connor.
- Amanda, she's right.

25:44.442 --> 25:47.177
I mean, have you thought about this, what
this means for both of your futures?

25:47.279 --> 25:49.813
Yes. I have.

25:49.915 --> 25:52.249
And I want to do
what's right for the baby.

25:52.350 --> 25:55.519
What about this other girl? Is
she gonna do the right thing?

25:55.587 --> 25:58.055
- Yeah.
- That's great.

25:58.156 --> 26:00.424
And guess who gets
to pay for all of it.

26:00.525 --> 26:02.560
- Us, that's who.
- Really, Peter?

26:02.661 --> 26:04.328
You know, I've had
enough of this.

26:04.396 --> 26:07.665
Come on, Amanda, let's go.

26:10.335 --> 26:12.036
You know,

26:12.137 --> 26:14.705
we will contribute as much
as we possibly can.

26:14.773 --> 26:17.508
But I thought that you
knew that about us already.

26:20.979 --> 26:23.414
Amanda, wait.

26:24.783 --> 26:26.750
Why didn't you tell me?

26:26.851 --> 26:28.619
I was gonna tell you. You were
too busy fondling Heather.

26:28.720 --> 26:32.289
- I don't want anything to with her.
- Exactly, Connor.

26:32.390 --> 26:35.559
If it was just us,
I could talk to you.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.328
But it's not.

26:37.395 --> 26:39.435
- Amanda, please...
- Connor.

26:42.867 --> 26:45.836
Look, I don't care

26:45.904 --> 26:48.138
what my parents say.

26:48.206 --> 26:50.975
I'm gonna be here for you
whether you want me to or not.

26:57.515 --> 26:59.383

Mrs. Heather Walker.

28:51.096 --> 28:53.330
What do you want?

28:55.400 --> 28:57.501
That's no way to
treat your boyfriend.

28:57.569 --> 29:00.404
Your dad got any beers?

29:00.472 --> 29:03.407
No.

29:03.508 --> 29:05.242
I said "no."

29:05.343 --> 29:07.311
And you're not staying.

29:07.412 --> 29:10.347
Come here.

29:10.448 --> 29:12.249
Come on.

29:12.350 --> 29:15.652
Dad's not home,

29:15.754 --> 29:18.288
you're looking great.

29:18.356 --> 29:21.636
It's been a month since I've been
in your pants. You know that?

29:21.659 --> 29:24.595
I don't want to see you
anymore, Trent.

29:24.662 --> 29:26.530
Why do you think
I haven't called?

29:26.631 --> 29:28.565
What,

29:28.666 --> 29:31.068
you got some new,
rich boyfriend?

29:31.136 --> 29:34.004
Seeing as the last time
you tried to swindle somebody,

29:34.105 --> 29:35.572
it didn't work out so good.

29:35.640 --> 29:38.408
We're done, Trent.

29:38.476 --> 29:41.512
I'm getting tired of of
getting jerked around by you

29:41.613 --> 29:44.915
every time one of your
plans doesn't work out.

30:00.965 --> 30:04.034
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:04.135 --> 30:06.937
I just thought you should know
that this isn't the first time

30:07.038 --> 30:08.772
- that Heather has done this.
- What do you mean?

30:08.873 --> 30:10.974
- She's faking, Connor.
- Faking what?

30:11.075 --> 30:15.212
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No. No, I don't.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.981
What do you want,
Heather? Money?

30:18.049 --> 30:21.569
The attention? Or are you
just some pathological liar?

30:21.653 --> 30:23.987
- Hey, come on, Amanda, just forget it.
- No, you're lying, Heather.

30:24.088 --> 30:27.448
You're not pregnant. Just like you
lied at your last high school.

30:27.458 --> 30:29.860
Burkin High. I mean, seriously,

30:29.961 --> 30:32.429
how long did you think you
could get away with this?

30:32.530 --> 30:34.731
I bet you're lying to me about
Connor sleeping with you.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.467
Oh, trust me,
I did not make that up.

30:37.569 --> 30:40.737
You're just jealous because I'm
having your boyfriend's baby.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.073
Or is it "ex-boyfriend"?

30:43.174 --> 30:45.242
Oh, I have nothing
to be jealous about,

30:45.343 --> 30:47.423
because I'm pregnant too.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.414
Bet that wasn't part of
your twisted plan, was it?

30:50.481 --> 30:52.683
Connor was so drunk at that party,
he barely remembers anything.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.718
For all he knows, you're
making everything up.

30:54.819 --> 30:56.787
You just can't
deal with the fact

30:56.888 --> 30:59.489
that your boyfriend
cheated on you, can you?

30:59.591 --> 31:01.391
Let me paint a little
picture for you:

31:01.492 --> 31:04.561
Me and Connor in the front
seat of his daddy's Mercedes.

31:04.662 --> 31:06.163
- Amanda...
- Just don't!

31:06.264 --> 31:09.099
You know, the one with the
soft leather interior

31:09.200 --> 31:11.668
with me on top and your
boyfriend underneath me.

31:11.769 --> 31:13.503
You're lying!

31:13.605 --> 31:17.007
- Oh! Connor!
- Whoa, whoa. What's going on here?

31:17.108 --> 31:19.376
Amanda, she pushed me!

31:19.444 --> 31:21.745
- Oh, my God!
- Back to class!

31:21.846 --> 31:24.181
Back to class!

31:24.282 --> 31:26.283
Okay. All right.

31:29.487 --> 31:32.623
Call 911. It's okay. Breathe.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.459
I just can't believe
she would do that, Connor.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.761
She could've hurt our baby.

31:37.862 --> 31:40.697
I mean, what about when
the baby actually comes?

31:40.798 --> 31:42.866
I'm just afraid of
what she might do.

31:42.967 --> 31:44.968
She wouldn't hurt
the baby, Heather.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.804
I'm in the hospital, Connor,

31:47.906 --> 31:49.806
because of her.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.909
Look, I'm not gonna
let anything happen.

31:52.010 --> 31:54.811
All right?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.480
- Mom.
- What happened?

31:56.581 --> 31:59.516
Nothing. The baby's fine.

31:59.617 --> 32:02.052
Nothing's fine.
Amanda pushed me.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.554
I take it you're Heather.

32:04.622 --> 32:06.556
Connor, will you
make sure I don't

32:06.624 --> 32:09.024
get a ticket where I'm parked
in front of the entrance?

32:14.933 --> 32:18.135
So, you're the one

32:18.236 --> 32:20.871
planning to be carrying
my son's baby.

32:20.972 --> 32:22.973
I am carrying your son's baby.

32:23.074 --> 32:26.410
- Have you had a paternity test?
- No.

32:26.511 --> 32:28.345
I won't endanger my baby.

32:28.413 --> 32:30.533
Besides, Connor knows I haven't
been with anyone else.

32:30.581 --> 32:33.617
Connor knows you haven't
been with anyone else. Sure.

32:33.718 --> 32:35.686
Connor doesn't know anything,

32:35.787 --> 32:38.322
but I have a pretty good idea

32:38.423 --> 32:40.190
of what you're all about.

32:40.258 --> 32:42.926
Just so you know.

32:42.994 --> 32:45.929
Oh, and don't sweat it.
It's just a blood test.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.867
You can't make me do it.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.337
We'll see about that.

33:01.346 --> 33:03.313
Hey.

33:03.414 --> 33:06.083
Hey. How is everything
with Heather?

33:06.184 --> 33:09.920
<i>Uh, the doctor said she and
the baby should be fine.</i>

33:10.021 --> 33:12.055
Look, I didn't mean
to hurt her.

33:12.156 --> 33:15.025
<i>I just... I'm sorry.</i>

33:15.126 --> 33:17.561
Amanda, I get that
this is my mess,

33:17.628 --> 33:19.948
<i>okay, but we're all just going
to have to try to get along.</i>

33:20.031 --> 33:22.733
I'm not gonna be friends with her,
if that's what you think, Connor.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.434
<i>I get that.</i>

33:24.535 --> 33:27.471
<i>So just leave her alone.</i>
<i>All right?</i>

33:27.572 --> 33:28.839
Fine.

33:28.940 --> 33:31.041
I'll do that.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.683
- Are you kidding me?
- Kelly, it is hard enough on your sister without you...

33:39.751 --> 33:42.619
She can't have a baby.
She's not even married.

33:42.687 --> 33:45.567
Or do you and your high-school sweetheart
Connor plan on getting hitched?

33:45.590 --> 33:47.791
- You know what, Kelly? That is enough.
- No, I mean it.

33:47.859 --> 33:51.795
How do they plan on raising a baby
between home room and soccer practice?

33:54.732 --> 33:58.292
You know, if there was ever a time
that Amanda needed a big sister,

33:58.369 --> 34:00.170
now would be it.

34:00.271 --> 34:02.039
Wait, just...

34:02.140 --> 34:03.740
I'll go.

34:14.518 --> 34:16.652
Look, I'm really sorry,
all right?

34:16.754 --> 34:19.523
I've been trying for
over a year, Amanda.

34:19.590 --> 34:23.693
I want a family more than
anything in the world.

34:23.761 --> 34:26.663
- And then you just go and...
- I know.

34:26.764 --> 34:29.833
It's not fair.

34:31.668 --> 34:34.603
Fair or not,
I'm still your sister,

34:34.705 --> 34:37.025
and I'm here for you, okay?

34:38.543 --> 34:40.177
I mean it.

34:57.929 --> 35:01.064
Oh! I know you'll
take care of us.

I mean, everything I wear
is so uncomfortable.

36:11.869 --> 36:13.937
What are you doing here?

36:14.038 --> 36:17.607
He called and asked if he could
be here for the ultrasound.

36:20.311 --> 36:22.412
I'll just meet you in the car.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.548
Actually, Mrs. Cohen,

36:24.615 --> 36:27.284
I would prefer to take
Amanda home myself,

36:27.351 --> 36:29.886
if that's okay with you.

36:29.987 --> 36:31.955
Of course.

36:32.056 --> 36:34.057
Good luck, you guys.

All righty. Well,

36:49.540 --> 36:52.576
unless it's hiding, it looks like
you're going to have a girl.

36:52.677 --> 36:55.412
Really?

36:55.513 --> 36:57.047
I'm having a girl?

36:57.114 --> 36:59.950
It's pretty safe to paint
your nursery pink.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.985
And everything else looks okay?

37:02.053 --> 37:05.555
Everything looks fine. Do you
want to hear the heartbeat?

37:05.623 --> 37:06.823
- Yes.
- Yeah, for sure.

37:11.796 --> 37:13.496
That is crazy!

37:13.598 --> 37:16.166
That's weird.

37:18.703 --> 37:21.571
Thank you, baby daddy.

37:27.278 --> 37:30.146
Ooh!

37:30.248 --> 37:33.750
Oh, Connor's gonna
love me in this.

37:35.319 --> 37:39.122
Ah!

37:39.190 --> 37:41.391
Hmm.

37:46.464 --> 37:49.344
You left your keys in the door again.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.737
Seriously? You got
to be kidding me.

37:54.905 --> 37:56.273
Jeez...

37:56.374 --> 37:58.708
It's not your problem, Dad.

37:58.776 --> 38:01.011
Yeah, you're damn right
that ain't my problem.

38:01.078 --> 38:03.647
Well, I wouldn't expect
anything to change now.

38:03.714 --> 38:06.850
Well, I hope you got it
all figured out, then.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.685
Of course I do.

38:08.753 --> 38:09.986
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:10.087 --> 38:12.622
I'm not that much
like Mom. I was smart.

38:12.690 --> 38:14.891
- I didn't pick a loser.
- Hmm.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.661
Well, he must be some
kind of lucky boy, then.

38:17.728 --> 38:21.164
Don't lose them again.
Clean all that up.

38:27.672 --> 38:29.906
That's incredible.

38:29.974 --> 38:32.442
It's like in 3-D and everything.

38:32.543 --> 38:35.211
- You can clean up now.
- Okay.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.787
I heard your mom was making
her take a paternity test.

38:43.888 --> 38:48.158
Yeah. We should hear back
from the lab today.

38:48.259 --> 38:50.260
She's driving me crazy, Amanda,

38:50.361 --> 38:53.396
calling and texting all
the time, needing stuff.

38:53.497 --> 38:56.466
And when I talked to you that day at
the hospital, I was stressed out.

38:56.534 --> 38:59.536
Okay? She got me thinking something
bad could've happened to the baby,

38:59.637 --> 39:01.638
and just didn't want
to deal with any more drama.

39:01.739 --> 39:03.573
But I never meant
to push you away.

39:11.148 --> 39:13.049
See what I mean?

39:13.150 --> 39:15.185
- Well, is everything okay?
- Yeah.

39:15.286 --> 39:17.821
I'll just tell her
I'm at your ultrasound.

39:17.922 --> 39:20.056
I mean, she's got to understand
that it's not just about her.

39:20.157 --> 39:22.292
Besides,

39:22.393 --> 39:25.428
I want to be here... with you.

39:27.865 --> 39:30.066
Connor, hi, this is me.
I need you to call me right now.

39:30.101 --> 39:33.603
I don't know why you're not answering
your phone. Please call me.

39:33.671 --> 39:36.573
Connor, hi, this is me.
I need you to call me back.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.409
Baby, I'm sorry, I need you to call me back right now.
This is really important.

39:39.510 --> 39:41.711
Please, you have to
call me back right now, okay?

40:08.472 --> 40:11.174
That bitch!

40:22.319 --> 40:24.354
So has Heather been
to her ultrasound?

40:24.455 --> 40:26.589
Not yet, but I'm sure
she'll let me know,

40:26.690 --> 40:30.126
seeing as my parents have to pay for it.

40:30.227 --> 40:32.695
Thanks for letting me
be there today.

40:44.809 --> 40:47.677
- Is it her again?
- Yeah.

40:47.778 --> 40:51.178
She says she's taken some pill to calm
her down, and now she feels sick.

40:51.215 --> 40:53.049
Better go.

40:53.150 --> 40:54.918
Amanda, she doesn't
have anyone else.

40:55.019 --> 40:57.854
I get it. Go.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.956
I'm sorry.

41:08.999 --> 41:11.835
All right, I'll tell her.
Thanks.

41:11.902 --> 41:14.103
So the doctor said you and
the baby should be fine,

41:14.205 --> 41:17.106
but to never take any medication
again until you talk to him first.

41:17.208 --> 41:19.509
I'm sorry, Connor.

41:19.610 --> 41:21.611
It's okay.

41:23.013 --> 41:25.882
You need anything?

41:25.983 --> 41:28.718
I'd love something to drink.

42:13.230 --> 42:14.831
- Here.
- Thanks.

42:18.569 --> 42:22.138
- So, where's the baby going to sleep?
- My room. Want to see?

42:24.575 --> 42:28.177
I was thinking maybe I could put the
baby bed right here next to mine.

42:28.279 --> 42:30.313
I want to fix it up
a little bit.

42:30.414 --> 42:33.116
And some new furniture
and curtains

42:33.217 --> 42:36.352
and a new heater and maybe patch
up some of the holes on the wall.

42:36.453 --> 42:38.388
Do you think maybe
your parents could help out?

42:38.489 --> 42:42.058
'Cause I'd really hate for our baby
to be sleeping in here like it is.

42:42.159 --> 42:44.127
I'll talk to them.

42:44.228 --> 42:47.263
- Do you want to come in?
- No, thanks. I'd better get going.

42:47.331 --> 42:49.499
Well, do you want to just
stay, just for a little bit?

42:49.600 --> 42:51.801
'Cause it kind of gets
lonely here lately,

42:51.902 --> 42:53.636
and my dad's never around,

42:53.737 --> 42:55.777
and my mom hasn't called
in over a year, so...

42:55.873 --> 42:58.274
Sounds like your dad's home now.

42:58.375 --> 43:00.877
- We should talk to him.
- Okay.

43:11.255 --> 43:13.590
Hey, kid.

43:13.691 --> 43:15.258
Come here.

43:20.030 --> 43:21.497
Come on.

43:22.967 --> 43:25.702
Come on.

43:25.803 --> 43:27.870
Are you the one?

43:27.972 --> 43:29.906
I'm sorry?

43:30.007 --> 43:33.710
The one who put my girl in her condition.
Is that you?

43:36.580 --> 43:38.114
That's what she says.

43:41.285 --> 43:43.586
You poor little son of a bitch.

43:53.964 --> 43:55.865
Hey. Feel any better?

43:55.966 --> 43:57.900
- Not really.
- You know,

43:58.002 --> 44:01.170
when Connor called and said he
wanted to go to the ultrasound,

44:01.271 --> 44:03.671
he said he really wanted
to be there for you.

44:03.674 --> 44:07.143
Yeah, well, he can't be
in two places at once, can he?

44:08.879 --> 44:12.115
He loves you, Amanda, not her.

44:12.216 --> 44:14.384
Try to remember that, okay?

44:30.134 --> 44:32.168
<i>Hey, it's me, Amanda.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

44:35.472 --> 44:37.540
So I just got off
the phone with the lab.

44:39.543 --> 44:42.311
Heather's baby is yours.

44:53.791 --> 44:55.191
Are you all right?

44:55.292 --> 44:57.060
Yeah.

44:59.930 --> 45:01.698
Look,

45:01.799 --> 45:04.867
I was just over
at her house, Mom.

45:04.968 --> 45:08.004
It's a mess. She showed me where
the baby was supposed to sleep,

45:08.105 --> 45:10.039
and it was disgusting.

45:10.107 --> 45:13.910
She asked if we could
help fix it up.

45:13.977 --> 45:16.779
- Now that we know the baby's mine...
- So she wants money for this?

45:16.880 --> 45:19.148
She doesn't have any
herself, Mom.

45:19.249 --> 45:20.850
I'm well aware of that, Connor.

45:26.356 --> 45:29.859
God, don't worry about it.
I'll take care of everything.

45:31.195 --> 45:33.429
I'll take care of it.

45:37.134 --> 45:41.204
Social media that
the baby's Connor's.

45:41.271 --> 45:43.272
She even posted
a picture of the test.

45:43.373 --> 45:45.733
Hey, I was calling, and...

45:45.776 --> 45:49.612
I was calling and texting
you all night. The results came back.

45:49.680 --> 45:52.849
I heard. Is that why you went and stayed
at Heather's house? To celebrate?

45:52.950 --> 45:55.418
What are you talking about?
I came home.

45:55.486 --> 45:57.353
Connor, you texted me saying
that you were staying there.

45:57.454 --> 45:59.388
No, I didn't.

46:10.434 --> 46:12.668
You can stop with the stupid
little games, Heather.

46:12.736 --> 46:16.105
I mean, really. Texting me that
Connor stayed over? Pathetic.

46:16.173 --> 46:18.407
What's pathetic is you
believing everything.

46:18.475 --> 46:20.443
Connor tells you, or doesn't.

46:20.544 --> 46:22.011
In case you forget,

46:22.079 --> 46:25.314
he never told you that
he slept with me before,

46:25.415 --> 46:28.284
so why would he
tell you the truth now?

46:37.995 --> 46:40.897
<i>♪ She welcomed me</i>
<i>with open arms ♪</i>

46:40.998 --> 46:43.499
<i>♪ She gave me coffee,</i>

47:15.766 --> 47:19.168
- Are you Heather's father?
- Yeah. Who are you?

47:19.269 --> 47:22.071
I'm Diane Walker.

47:22.172 --> 47:24.941
My son is the father
of your daughter's child.

47:25.042 --> 47:27.143
Okay, I get it.

47:27.244 --> 47:29.545
No, no, I don't think you
do get it, Mr. Henderson.

47:29.646 --> 47:31.547
You see, my son

47:31.615 --> 47:33.850
has a very, very bright future,

47:33.951 --> 47:37.787
and, well, quite frankly, a
baby isn't part of his plan.

47:37.888 --> 47:40.022
Okay, so what
you're saying is that

47:40.123 --> 47:41.924
your son knocks up my daughter,

47:41.992 --> 47:44.633
- and now he ain't gonna step up?
- I'm saying,

47:44.661 --> 47:46.629
my son made a mistake,

47:46.730 --> 47:50.566
one which I'm pretty sure
your daughter planned.

47:50.634 --> 47:52.401
Which is why I'm here...

47:52.502 --> 47:54.136
to make good on that plan.

47:54.204 --> 47:56.405
That should help
raise the child

47:56.506 --> 47:59.208
for the next seven or eight
years, and after that,

47:59.309 --> 48:01.310
we can make other
arrangements, but only

48:01.378 --> 48:03.512
if Heather stays
away from my son.

48:03.614 --> 48:06.816
- Are we clear?
- Oh, yeah.

48:06.917 --> 48:10.620
Then if we have a deal,
I need you to sign these.

48:20.397 --> 48:22.331
Cool.

48:22.432 --> 48:24.713
Wouldn't you like your copy?

48:31.408 --> 48:33.876
You want to come inside
and have a drink or something?

48:38.215 --> 48:41.017
Bein' neighborly. Ha!

48:41.118 --> 48:43.085
<i>Hey, check this out.</i>

48:44.855 --> 48:46.489
I'm sure these will
piss Heather off,

48:46.590 --> 48:49.959
since I bet nobody decided
to throw her a baby shower.

48:50.060 --> 48:52.428
- What?
- It's not a game, Mya.

48:52.529 --> 48:54.697
I know that.

48:54.798 --> 48:57.566
But she's playing like
it is, so you have to too.

48:57.634 --> 49:00.603
I mean, you believe she's the
one who texted you, right?

49:02.639 --> 49:05.408
She's messing with you, Amanda.

49:05.475 --> 49:07.743
Look, you've got to give
Connor a chance here.

49:07.844 --> 49:09.712
He's been texting me today.

49:09.813 --> 49:12.014
Wants to know if he can see me.

49:12.115 --> 49:14.317
Then forget the crazy bitch
and go.

49:14.384 --> 49:16.185
Look at that.

49:16.286 --> 49:19.355
One "like" already.

49:21.625 --> 49:24.994
I'm so not surprised
we're having a boy.

49:25.062 --> 49:27.997
I mean, I've been
dreaming about this.

49:28.098 --> 49:30.166
You and me taking him

49:30.267 --> 49:32.301
to his first ball game.

49:32.402 --> 49:34.170
Oh, by the way,

49:34.271 --> 49:36.205
did you talk to your mom about
getting money for the "renos"?

49:36.273 --> 49:38.240
Yep. She said she'd
help take care of it.

49:38.342 --> 49:40.242
Good!

49:40.344 --> 49:42.311
You want to come in?

49:42.412 --> 49:45.081
Ah, I can't.
I got to be somewhere.

49:46.149 --> 49:48.517
Fine!

50:15.612 --> 50:17.913
Dad?

50:55.285 --> 50:59.321
Look, I know things are
really messed up right now,

50:59.423 --> 51:02.358
and you have every
reason to doubt me,

51:02.459 --> 51:05.394
but you got to know...

51:05.495 --> 51:07.830
it's you.

51:07.931 --> 51:10.251
I mean, it has always been you.

51:11.935 --> 51:13.936
I love you, Amanda,

51:14.037 --> 51:17.357
and I will do everything I have
to to win your trust back.

51:33.857 --> 51:35.558
Not so fast!

51:38.662 --> 51:41.997
What's going on?

51:42.065 --> 51:46.001
It appears Heather's
father has left.

51:46.103 --> 51:49.038
Uh, he left because

51:49.139 --> 51:51.474
your mom tried to pay him off.

51:51.575 --> 51:53.876
And now I don't even
have a dad.

51:53.977 --> 51:57.513
So this is the only place
I could think of to go.

51:57.614 --> 51:59.582
Is this true?

51:59.683 --> 52:02.551
- I was trying to help you, Connor.
- How is that helping, Mom?

52:02.619 --> 52:06.155
She's pregnant with my kid. She can't
just be living in the streets.

52:08.492 --> 52:10.626
Amanda!

52:14.564 --> 52:17.233
Hey, Amanda, wait.

52:17.334 --> 52:19.635
This doesn't change
anything, all right?

52:19.736 --> 52:22.104
What do you mean, it doesn't
change anything, Connor?

52:22.205 --> 52:24.540
It's obvious where she's
gonna be staying... with you.

52:24.641 --> 52:27.543
And that...
that changes everything.

52:43.059 --> 52:44.426
Hey.

52:44.528 --> 52:46.495
What's wrong? Are you okay?

52:46.596 --> 52:48.998
I don't think I can do this.

53:06.783 --> 53:09.518
This... is amazing.

53:09.619 --> 53:12.421
In the past couple weeks, I really
feel like I've been eating for two.

53:12.522 --> 53:16.292
Oh, by the way, there's a
school field trip next week,

53:16.359 --> 53:18.640
and I was hoping maybe you could
sign the permission form.

53:18.695 --> 53:20.396
It's, like, 20 bucks to go.

53:20.497 --> 53:23.032
So, um, Heather,

53:23.133 --> 53:26.035
have you started
thinking about a plan

53:26.136 --> 53:28.704
- for you, for the baby?
- Yeah, I have.

53:28.805 --> 53:31.774
I was thinking maybe we could set
up a room here, like a nursery,

53:31.875 --> 53:35.244
and Connor and I could live
here, unless, of course,

53:35.345 --> 53:37.646
you wanted us to live somewhere
else, and I'm sure you guys would

53:37.747 --> 53:39.448
help us out with
a down payment.

53:39.549 --> 53:42.251
Well, Connor
needs to finish school.

53:42.352 --> 53:44.920
And by "school" I mean college.

53:45.021 --> 53:46.722
Whittendale.

53:48.225 --> 53:50.392
Actually, I've decided to stay.

53:50.493 --> 53:52.761
Go to community college.

53:52.829 --> 53:55.331
That way I can still get
my degree and at least

53:55.398 --> 53:57.866
be here, you know,
for everything.

53:57.968 --> 54:00.769
But that doesn't mean
I'm moving out.

54:00.870 --> 54:04.350
Amanda and I still haven't
talked about our plan yet.

54:19.489 --> 54:21.809
<i>Hey, it's me, Amanda.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

54:25.695 --> 54:27.463
Hey, Amanda.

54:27.564 --> 54:30.733
Listen, I meant it when
I said nothing's changed.

54:30.834 --> 54:34.336
Trust me. Let me pick you
up for breakfast tomorrow,

54:34.437 --> 54:38.340
and then I'll take you
to Lamaze. Please.

54:38.441 --> 54:40.242
I love you.

54:40.343 --> 54:43.212
Uh, are you lost?

54:43.313 --> 54:45.914
Would you like me to show
you back to your room

54:46.016 --> 54:47.516
on the other side of the house?

54:53.823 --> 54:56.091
Good night.

55:07.137 --> 55:09.071
Brought you something to eat.

55:09.139 --> 55:12.041
Look, Amanda,

55:12.108 --> 55:15.044
I understand it must be so hard knowing
that Heather's over at Connor's,

55:15.111 --> 55:17.446
but he's just trying
to do the right thing.

55:17.514 --> 55:19.315
I know.

55:19.416 --> 55:21.250
It's just,
so much has happened,

55:21.351 --> 55:24.286
and the babies
haven't even come yet.

55:24.387 --> 55:27.756
Connor's not ready to be a dad.

55:27.857 --> 55:29.425
Not to two kids.

55:31.761 --> 55:34.229
Maybe keeping the baby
isn't the best decision.

55:36.166 --> 55:37.499
What are you saying?

55:37.567 --> 55:40.069
Maybe Kelly and Greg
are better parents.

55:40.136 --> 55:43.205
Oh, Amanda, sweetie.

55:43.273 --> 55:45.007
Look, giving up a child

55:45.108 --> 55:47.943
is one of the most difficult
things a mother can do.

55:48.044 --> 55:52.715
- Have you talked to Connor about this?
- No.

55:52.816 --> 55:54.850
You need to,

55:54.918 --> 55:58.119
because this is a decision that
you need to make together, okay?

56:24.447 --> 56:28.317
- Hey, sleepyhead. You slept in.
- Where's my mom?

56:28.418 --> 56:30.352
Oh, she had a hair appointment
or some stupid errand.

56:30.453 --> 56:32.087
I don't know.

56:32.188 --> 56:34.548
I made you ham and eggs.

56:35.325 --> 56:37.126
- My dad already left for his trip?
- Yeah.

56:37.193 --> 56:39.161
He was gone by the time
I got up this morning.

56:39.262 --> 56:41.463
Left a hot new Mercedes
in the garage.

56:41.564 --> 56:43.899
What's the deal? Does he get a
new one every year or something?

56:44.000 --> 56:46.335
Yeah, it's a company car.
They lease it to him.

56:46.436 --> 56:48.170
Mm, nice.

56:48.271 --> 56:50.372
We should break in
to that one too.

56:52.642 --> 56:55.077
- Where are you going?
- Just out.

56:55.145 --> 56:56.779
Well, I thought that we could
spend the day together,

56:56.846 --> 56:58.447
look at cribs and stuff.

56:58.548 --> 57:00.616
Heather, you're not due
for another six weeks.

57:00.683 --> 57:03.986
Are you going to see Amanda?

57:04.087 --> 57:06.155
Connor!

57:46.663 --> 57:49.264
- What nice wheels.
- What the hell are you doing here?

57:49.365 --> 57:53.168
I came to see how much
swag you ditched me for.

57:53.269 --> 57:56.472
Where are you going? Hey.

57:56.573 --> 57:59.775
It's not bad.

57:59.876 --> 58:02.911
I could use one of these,
seeing as they took my truck.

58:03.012 --> 58:04.513
They wouldn't repossess it
if you got a job.

58:04.614 --> 58:06.815
That's a great idea.

58:06.883 --> 58:08.617
Oh, you know
what's a better idea?

58:08.718 --> 58:10.252
I was thinking about this
on my ride over here.

58:10.353 --> 58:12.754
Seeing as one of your plans

58:12.856 --> 58:14.456
finally seems
to have worked out,

58:14.557 --> 58:18.393
I figure that you...
you can start paying me.

58:18.495 --> 58:20.963
- Screw you, Trent.
- Yeah, you did that already.

58:21.064 --> 58:25.033
Remember? Now it's my
turn to screw you.

58:25.134 --> 58:28.136
Look, if you don't start throwing
a little something my way,

58:28.238 --> 58:31.273
I'm gonna make things...
I'm gonna make things

58:31.374 --> 58:33.909
really uncomfortable
for you here.

58:34.010 --> 58:36.411
You forget that I know you.

58:36.513 --> 58:39.515
I know who you really are.

58:43.286 --> 58:45.854
You tell that kid about the other
rich dude you tried to hook up with?

58:45.955 --> 58:48.290
You tell him about
your miscarriages?

58:50.326 --> 58:52.427
There's a ball of secrets.

58:52.495 --> 58:54.897
So I recommend you just pay me.

58:56.766 --> 58:58.867
Where's their jewelry?

58:58.968 --> 59:00.602
Hmm?

59:00.703 --> 59:02.771
I can tell by
that belly of yours

59:02.872 --> 59:04.573
you've been
putting in some work.

59:04.674 --> 59:07.910
You're such a little slut.

59:41.611 --> 59:43.845
All righty, everyone.

59:43.947 --> 59:46.481
Today, we are going to practice

59:46.583 --> 59:48.550
breathing.

59:48.651 --> 59:51.153
So, now, let's take

59:51.254 --> 59:54.556
a deep, cleansing breath in...

59:56.859 --> 59:59.161
and out.

59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.530
And now I want

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:03.732
all the partners
breathing as well, okay?

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:07.135
And breathe in...

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.609
Now, partners,
I want you to wrap

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.445
your arms around the mother

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:19.181
as she leans back

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:21.283
into you.

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:26.488
Excellent. Okay.

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:46.908
Oh! Did you feel that?

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:50.012
Yeah, she's always active
during this time.

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:52.814
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah. That's incredible.

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:54.983
I know.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.029
All righty, everybody,

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.530
I want you to
continue practicing

01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:10.912
your breathing techniques,

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:13.487
and we will see you next week.

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:48.837
Look, Connor,

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:50.939
I know you've been
trying, but...

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:53.875
I've been thinking a lot
about you being a dad

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:56.044
not to just one
but to two babies.

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:58.513
I mean, you're only 17.

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:01.983
And trust me, I know that you would
give up anything for our baby,

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:03.618
just like I would,

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.154
but what if
there's another way?

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:09.825
A way that we could give our
baby the best life possible

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:11.960
and make someone
very, very happy?

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:16.264
I just want you to think
about what I'm about to say.

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:22.838
What are you talking about?

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:25.006
I'm talking about giving
our baby to my sister.

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:28.210
I mean, she's been
trying everything,

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:30.979
and nothing's working,
and it's breaking her heart.

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:34.649
And here I am, pregnant,
and I didn't plan for this.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:41.690
So it made me wonder that
maybe this is a sign.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:44.626
Maybe I was supposed
to get pregnant,

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:47.062
and she's meant
to have the baby.

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:49.931
So this is what you want to do?

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.101
If you do.

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:57.339
I-I don't know.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.642
I really don't know.

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:06.628
And that's why I love you.

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:28.603
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car!

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:30.932
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.735
I called the police 'cause I thought
somebody had stolen the car.

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:37.305
What made you think you could take
Peter's car without even asking, huh?

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:41.276
Really? That's it?

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:44.145
No apology? You listen to me.

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:46.247
You know you're not a part
of this family, Heather.

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:47.916
You're only here
because of my grandchild.

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:49.651
So don't make yourself
so damned comfortable.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.586
Because Connor won't
have you, ever!

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:54.256
I am just so sick of you,
you meddling bitch!

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:56.157
You just can't
leave us alone, can you?

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:59.961
I mean, don't you get it?
I am having your son's baby.

01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:01.897
Me. That's right.

01:05:01.964 --> 01:05:03.832
The girl from the wrong side
of the tracks.

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:07.002
Is that what's so horrifying to you?
That I'm not good enough?

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:10.605
What's so horrifying to me
is what kind of person you are.

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:13.041
Manipulative, conniving.

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:15.644
In fact, I'm now really worried

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.846
whether you're even a fit
mother for my grandchild.

01:05:17.947 --> 01:05:20.782
Are you insane?

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:24.819
- What is wrong with you?
- Don't you mess with me or my baby, Diane,

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:27.856
because you will be so sorry!

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:41.202
What's up, buddy?

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:43.705
So, how'd you sleep last night?

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.040
Fine.

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:49.177
Did you get any?

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:51.479
No, hey, hey, hey, how is it to
hook up with a pregnant chick?

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.582
- Dude, what are you talking about?
- Oh, okay.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.484
You're not gonna
tell me? Bro...

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:58.153
Look.

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:03.658
You're a freak, bro.
You're a freak.

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:16.004
What happened?

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:18.573
The mother of your child,
Heather, just went crazy.

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:20.775
Look, Connor, she can't
stay here anymore.

01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:23.645
That's it. I won't have it. I will
pay to have her put up somewhere,

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:25.747
but she is not staying
in this house.

01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:27.882
I am not going to be assaulted
in my own home. That's it.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.085
She hurt you?

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:36.925
I got it.

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:55.477
- Get out.
- Look.

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:58.446
I thought I'd use this photo until we get
a real photo of the three of us together.

01:06:58.547 --> 01:07:00.448
You have crossed the line.

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:02.751
I mean, taking pictures of us

01:07:02.818 --> 01:07:04.419
sleeping together
is bad enough,

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.855
but when you hurt
my mom, that's it.

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:10.525
- I want you out!
- Really? And why do you think I'm here in the first place?

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:12.594
Or did you forget
what your mother did?

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:15.130
I don't care, Heather. Okay?

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:18.400
I am done being the good guy
because you are crazy!

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:21.436
Okay? It doesn't matter how many
pictures you take of us together,

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:23.705
we are not a couple!

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:26.441
Because I love Amanda. And you?

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:28.276
I don't even like you.

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:30.512
Wait. Wait!

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:32.981
Connor! I didn't mean
to hurt your mom!

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:35.450
Connor, I'm sorry!

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:39.721
Connor! Connor! Connor!

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:50.865
Have you thought at all
about what we talked about?

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:53.401
Kelly and the baby?

01:07:53.502 --> 01:07:55.403
Yeah.

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:58.039
And I'm starting to think
maybe you're right.

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:03.230
Maybe there is a reason
you got pregnant.

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:41.582
Okay, it's ready.

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:43.952
Dad, will you hand me
a hot dog, please?

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:46.354
- Yes, sweetie.
- Thank you.

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:49.176
- Remember I like my burgers rare.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:53.528
Kelly, Greg, uh,

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:56.631
Connor and I have something
we want to ask you.

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:58.700
We've been talking,

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:02.470
and of course we want what's
best for our little girl,

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:04.606
and we've agreed that

01:09:04.673 --> 01:09:07.242
the best is you two.

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.215
I'm not following.

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:16.618
We want to know if
you'd adopt our baby.

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:19.053
Are you serious?

01:09:19.121 --> 01:09:22.590
I mean, you guys have
wanted this for so long,

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:25.093
and you would just be
amazing parents.

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:27.761
Amanda, are you sure?

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.932
We're sure.

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:33.868
I don't know what to say.

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:37.005
Say yes.

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:44.912
Thank you, thank you!

01:09:44.979 --> 01:09:48.783
- Congratulations.
- I'm assuming that that's a yes.

01:09:48.884 --> 01:09:50.318
Yes, of course it is.

01:09:50.419 --> 01:09:52.886
You guys are gonna be great.

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:54.756
Thank you.

01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:57.625
- I want to do a toast.
- Yes.

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:02.363
- To family.
- To family.

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:06.601
We're gonna have a baby!

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:11.906
It's okay.

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:45.740
If you haven't handed me

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:49.042
a signed permission form to go on
this field trip, you can't go.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.479
- Does everyone understand that?
- Yes.

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:53.414
All right? Okay. Line up.

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:55.783
- Is Heather coming?
- I think so.

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:58.453
My mom signed her form.

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:25.139
All right,
everybody, buckle up. Let's go.

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:39.227
Yay! We're here!

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:41.162
All right, we're going to
break up into two groups.

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:44.165
Group A goes into the conservation
center with Gray Eagle,

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:47.335
and group B will
join me in the park.

01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:51.639
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:58.112
All right, everyone, let's go.

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:03.651
Have a wonderful day.
Follow me.

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.466
Hey, check this out.

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:21.636
Dude, look at this in here.

01:12:29.912 --> 01:12:32.146
Mrs. Wolk, I have to
use the restroom.

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:34.916
Oh. Okay, there's one back
in the conservation center.

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:36.984
Take the shortcut,
but stay on the trail.

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:38.786
- I will.
- Okay.

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:42.750
God, Heather!
What are you doing here?

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:45.319
Just making sure
you don't get lost.

01:13:46.655 --> 01:13:48.256
You know, we were
planning on getting

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:50.758
our own place together
to raise our baby.

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:53.461
That's actually the reason why his
parents put me up in an apartment...

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:55.430
because they just
couldn't handle the fact

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:57.632
that their precious Connor
wasn't theirs anymore.

01:13:57.733 --> 01:14:01.402
You're lying, Heather. That was
never going to happen. - No?

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:03.738
You know that picture
of you two next to his bed?

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:07.708
He actually put that away and replaced
it with a picture of our ultrasound.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.610
And I never asked him to.
He just did it.

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:11.746
And he just loves
my pregnant body.

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:14.849
And the best part is, we don't
have to use any protection.

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.918
It's just so awesome.
It's so intimate.

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:19.053
It's just me, him,
and his baby.

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:22.990
Just stop, Heather! He'd never
sleep with you, all right?

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:26.727
He doesn't love you,
and he's said so himself.

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:28.863
I mean, God, when are
you gonna get it

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.832
through that twisted
head of yours

01:14:30.933 --> 01:14:32.733
that you're just
a mistake that he made?

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:35.803
Your little plan to trap him or
whatever obviously backfired,

01:14:35.904 --> 01:14:37.738
'cause where are you now?

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.308
You're alone in some apartment,

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:43.678
and soon you're gonna be alone
with a baby to take care of.

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:46.047
Is that what you wanted?
'Cause if it is,

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.449
congratulations... you got it.

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:51.152
You stupid bitch!

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:52.587
Why?

01:14:52.688 --> 01:14:55.423
Why did you have to
get pregnant?

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:57.225
He didn't want you!

01:14:57.326 --> 01:15:00.428
He wanted me!
And he still does!

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:04.165
Because he promised that
he will take care of me!

01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:06.067
Of us! And you?

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:09.604
Why are you trying
to ruin this? Why?

01:15:09.705 --> 01:15:11.973
You already have a family!

01:15:12.074 --> 01:15:15.276
And what do I have?
I have nothing!

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:18.379
Everyone in my life has left me.
Do you know what that's like?

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.782
No, of course you don't,
because you have everything

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:24.852
that you want,
you stupid, spoiled,

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:26.387
selfish little bitch!

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:33.995
Miss Wolk.

01:15:35.397 --> 01:15:37.131
Where's Amanda?

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:39.166
I thought she came back
to use the restroom.

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:41.936
I didn't see her.

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:43.971
- Let me go check.
- Okay.

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:47.341
Have you guys seen Amanda?

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:49.410
Ladies, have you seen Amanda?

01:15:51.246 --> 01:15:52.980
Amanda!

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:26.581
She's not there.

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:29.363
Okay, I want everyone inside, and
stay there until the next lecture.

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:03.718
Amanda!

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:05.786
Amanda!

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:19.200
Amanda! The baby's coming!

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.837
Amanda, please help!

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:26.907
Come back, please! The baby's coming!
I need your help!

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:30.444
Amanda!

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:33.848
The baby's coming!
The baby's coming!

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:36.684
Help!

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:38.285
Amanda, help!

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:40.054
- We have to get you back.
- No, I can't!

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:42.623
- I don't know. Um...
- Oh, do something!

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:44.725
Okay, give me your shirt.
Give me your shirt.

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:48.896
Amanda!

01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:56.103
Okay, I need you to push.

01:17:56.204 --> 01:17:58.839
- I can't!
- Heather, I need you to push!

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.775
Push!

01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:02.643
- I can't!
- Breathe!

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:05.613
Heather, do you want to have this baby?

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:08.716
- Yes!
- Then push!

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:44.218
Amanda! Amanda!

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:51.025
It's our baby, Connor.
It's our baby!

01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:16.183
Oh, my gosh.

01:19:16.284 --> 01:19:18.886
She's so adorable.

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:22.022
Look at that.

01:19:22.124 --> 01:19:23.858
Look at her smile.

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:25.793
Hi, little girl.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:30.798
I have just been
dying to meet you.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:38.305
This is your daddy.

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:42.249
He loves you very much.

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:46.680
We both do.

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:50.317
That's why it was so hard

01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:54.955
to do what's best
for you right now.

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.763
But don't you worry.

01:20:02.864 --> 01:20:05.065
We'll always be here for you.

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:09.436
And one day, you will
have a little cousin

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:12.039
that you can play with.

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:23.684
I love you, baby girl.

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:27.955
With all of my heart.

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:31.759
Are you ready?

01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:37.129
Hey.

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:40.334
How are you both doing?

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:43.671
- Okay.
- She's beautiful,

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:46.674
just like you.

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:48.843
I mean, look at that nose.

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:52.470
There's no
doubt she's your baby.

01:20:57.953 --> 01:21:00.688
She's yours, Amanda.

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:02.690
Yours and Connor's.

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:04.792
You're her parents.

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:09.129
It wouldn't be right for
us to take her from you.

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:11.765
But you've wanted
a family for so long,

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:14.468
and you were so happy.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:15.936
There's still time for me.

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:18.172
Don't worry. I'll be just fine.

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:20.908
Besides, I am going to be

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:24.245
the coolest aunt in the world.

01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:27.581
I love you.

01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:30.084
I love you too.

01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:38.859
Knock, knock. How's my little
girl and my granddaughter?

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.294
- Hi!
- Perfect.

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:42.563
Oh!

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:45.366
- Oh, there's my boy.
- There he is.

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:47.835
- How's he doing?
- Oh, he's doing great. He's gaining a pound a day, I bet.

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:50.271
This kid, he has an iron grip.

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:52.239
He grabs a hold of your
finger, and he never lets go.

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:53.974
He's gonna be a bruiser
like his dad.

01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:56.677
We just wanted to
come by and say hi.

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:58.345
We want to give
you guys your privacy.

01:21:58.446 --> 01:22:00.047
We'll come back a little later.

01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:02.082
Hold on. I want to
get a picture first.

01:22:02.183 --> 01:22:05.085
Connor, you're there next to Amanda.
You and Ryan.

01:22:05.186 --> 01:22:07.347
This is gonna be
our first family portrait.

01:22:07.422 --> 01:22:09.790
All right, now, just hold
that pose and say "cheese."

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:12.760
All right, now, everyone,
a selfie. Let's do it.

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:14.862
- Selfie!
- Mom, did you just say "selfie"?

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:17.031
- Yes.
- Parents aren't allowed to say "selfie."

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:19.233
- Yeah, we are.
- No, you're not.

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:22.136
- We old folks get to do it too!
- She loves these.

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:24.038
Cheese! Say "selfie."

01:22:24.139 --> 01:22:27.708
Well, they found Trent's body
in your basement.

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:30.277
Your dad was out of town,

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:32.646
so all the evidence
points to you.

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:35.249
If you don't take the plea,

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:38.585
it's life in prison, no parole.

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.721
Take the plea, you might
be out in 20 or less

01:22:40.822 --> 01:22:42.723
with good behavior.

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:44.491
Whatever.

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:53.133
Can I get some water?

01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:56.670
Sure.
