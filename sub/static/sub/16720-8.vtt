00:21.504 --> 00:23.434
Okay, everyone,
I hope you've all chosen

00:23.464 --> 00:25.779
your lab partners wisely.
I have.

00:25.809 --> 00:28.277
You'll notice a mixture in front
of you on the Bunsen burner.

00:28.356 --> 00:30.236
Buns... sen.

00:30.266 --> 00:31.911
This mixture
is the most powerful

00:31.941 --> 00:33.954
love potion known to man.

00:33.984 --> 00:36.350
Whatever you do, don't drink it.

00:36.380 --> 00:38.713
Jimmy Junior, no!
It will make you

00:38.743 --> 00:40.723
want to touch each other's butts!
Too late.

00:40.753 --> 00:43.236
I don't need a love potion
to want to do that stuff...

00:43.266 --> 00:45.548
with you.

Chad doesn't have a partner.

00:49.027 --> 00:51.495
Maybe he can join you.

Damn.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.349
What kind of a maniac
wakes up an hour early

01:08.379 --> 01:10.124
to write erotic fan fiction?
Me.

01:10.154 --> 01:13.040
LOUISE: Are there any shows
or movies left in the world

01:13.070 --> 01:15.167
that you haven't perved up?
No.

01:15.197 --> 01:17.780
That's why I've started
writing erotic friend fiction.

01:17.810 --> 01:19.825
Using people at school
and zombies.

01:19.855 --> 01:21.868
Oh! Do the janitor
and the vice principal.

01:21.898 --> 01:23.766
I think they'd have
beautiful children.

01:23.841 --> 01:25.709
I did and they don't.

01:25.785 --> 01:29.788
Good morning, my little late
bird. What's with the vest?

01:29.872 --> 01:31.518
It's my Welcome Wagon vest.

01:31.548 --> 01:33.679
I'm showing a new girl
around school today.

01:33.709 --> 01:37.181

what we're seeing tonight! Ugh.

This is the cafeteria,

02:00.062 --> 02:01.623
And that's our American flag...

02:01.653 --> 02:03.331
Tina, no offence, but this tour

02:03.361 --> 02:06.063
is giving me a snore-gasm.
Show me something good.

02:06.143 --> 02:09.396
Well, there's a typo on the
lunch menu. It says "browie."

02:09.426 --> 02:11.373
Seriously, what do you
do for fun around here?

02:11.403 --> 02:13.919
I think there's more on the Tina
tour than you're showing me.

02:13.949 --> 02:16.517
Okay. There is one place
I like to go.

02:16.596 --> 02:18.459
TAMMY: What is this?

02:18.489 --> 02:21.810
TINA: The boys' locker room. You
can only see up to their ankles.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.189
So, you just go around looking
through random holes?

02:24.219 --> 02:26.836
Yes, but not any more. Now I
just look through this one.

02:26.866 --> 02:29.952
Those are Jimmy Junior's feet.
I can tell by the way he walks.

02:29.982 --> 02:31.916
So confident, but still
figuring things out.

JIMMY JR.: No, Zeke!

02:33.623 --> 02:35.732
Skid marks. (CHUCKLES)
That's not funny.

02:35.762 --> 02:38.479
They're stripes.
Smelly stripes. (CHUCKLES)

02:38.509 --> 02:41.059
ZEKE: Phew, you stink!
TAMMY: Okay, and who is that?

02:41.089 --> 02:44.142
Zeke. He's got some
hyper in his diaper.

02:44.172 --> 02:46.772
I'd like to see what that shin
bone's connected to. Tammy, don't.

02:46.802 --> 02:49.704
Someone might see us.

It's no big deal, Tina.
Don't have a crap attack.

02:57.758 --> 03:00.476
Sucks they give you detention
for wrestling in the library.

03:00.506 --> 03:03.725

have you been?

Really?
I can't believe this!

03:47.967 --> 03:50.374
Detention is no big deal, Mom.
Don't have a crap attack.

03:50.446 --> 03:52.964
What did you just say?

03:53.043 --> 03:56.280
A crap attack.
Don't have one.

03:56.310 --> 03:59.162
(GASPS) Don't you tell me
not to have a crap attack!

03:59.192 --> 04:02.110
I'll have a crap attack any time
I want! Now, go to your room!

04:02.140 --> 04:03.719
This is such a snore-gasm.

What is it? Yeah. A crap attack?
I don't know. Do you?

04:08.188 --> 04:10.872
Don't look at me. Well, you're
the one that wanted to have one.

04:10.902 --> 04:14.289
You're the one that sent her to her
room for saying it. I don't know what

04:14.319 --> 04:16.199
these kids are saying.
Don't have a crap attack.

04:16.231 --> 04:17.271

04:20.765 --> 04:22.646
I can't believe
Tina got detention.

04:22.676 --> 04:25.958
She's changing, Bobby.
Tina's turning into a teen.

04:25.988 --> 04:29.074
You've lost her, Mom. Time to
focus on your good daughter.

04:29.104 --> 04:30.794
Gene.
I'm pretty.

04:30.846 --> 04:32.861
You know, maybe you're
overreacting, Lin.

04:32.891 --> 04:35.398
I mean,
you did have a crap attack. Ha...!

04:35.453 --> 04:37.836
She's supposed to baby-sit
tonight while we're at Cake.

04:37.866 --> 04:40.013
Can we even trust her now?
That's a good point.

04:40.043 --> 04:42.125
Maybe we should stay home.
What?

04:42.155 --> 04:43.767
Please?
We're not skipping Cake.

04:43.797 --> 04:45.898
Okay, fine. But I'm gonna
complain the whole time.

04:45.974 --> 04:47.608
Yeah!

04:50.917 --> 04:54.170
You're the baddest girl
in detention, Tina.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.855
Tell me about it, stud.
(GIGGLES) I'm a stud.

I'm an idiot. I know, Zeke.
Don't talk anymore

05:00.147 --> 05:01.793

with your pants.

(BIG SIGH)

05:09.361 --> 05:12.615
We need to go over some ground
rules for tonight, Miss Mouthy.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.798
No boys, no parties,
no summoning spirits

05:15.828 --> 05:17.993
or switching bodies,
and no filling the house

05:18.023 --> 05:20.090
with soap bubbles.
You hear me, Tina?

05:20.167 --> 05:22.724
Yes. I wear glasses,
not hearing aids, Mom.

05:22.781 --> 05:26.737
Ho! Well, I don't wear a hearing
aid either, so I didn't hear that.

05:26.767 --> 05:29.369
Haw!
Well, good night.

05:29.449 --> 05:32.585
What are you doing with
the emergency cell phone?

05:32.615 --> 05:35.399
Texting my friend Tammy.
That'll cost a fortune!

05:35.429 --> 05:37.175
We have a terrible data plan!

05:37.205 --> 05:40.291
Tammy wants to come over.
I texted back a smiley face.

05:40.321 --> 05:42.469
She texted back some letters
I don't understand.

05:42.499 --> 05:45.652

06:09.287 --> 06:11.071
Huh?

06:11.146 --> 06:15.254
Cute room. I used to have one
of these. I cut its mane off.

06:15.284 --> 06:17.801
I bet that looked cool.
I'm totally going to do that.

06:17.831 --> 06:19.107
(WHISPERS):
No, I won't.

06:19.137 --> 06:21.385
This is like
watching two monkeys

06:21.415 --> 06:24.200
at the puberty zoo.
What's wrong with her face?

06:24.230 --> 06:26.698
Looks like she needs
a flu shot in her eyes.

06:26.777 --> 06:30.131
What's this?
It's my erotic friend fiction.

06:30.161 --> 06:32.477
"Tina reached towards
Jimmy Junior's butt:

06:32.507 --> 06:36.631
"'Your lips say no but your butt
says yes.'" This is hilarious!

06:36.661 --> 06:39.546
It's not meant to be hilarious.
It's supposed to be erotic.

06:39.576 --> 06:42.830
Maybe you don't understand it.
Oh, I understand. And I'm into it.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.309
But never let
Jimmy Junior see this.

06:45.339 --> 06:48.257
He'd be weirded out and
he'd never talk to you again.

06:48.287 --> 06:51.139
Really? Oh, my God,
there's a little drawing here

06:51.169 --> 06:53.518
of Jimmy Junior's butt.
(LAUGHS)

06:53.548 --> 06:55.816
(FARTS) Wha...?

06:55.894 --> 06:58.778
What just happened?
I think Tammy laugh-farted.

06:58.808 --> 06:59.884
That really smells, Tammy.

06:59.914 --> 07:01.191
What? I didn't fart, you did!

07:01.221 --> 07:03.067
Oh. Okay.

07:03.097 --> 07:06.464
Come on, if you're gonna be
loud, you got to be proud!

07:06.515 --> 07:08.997
Anyway, since you're
such a good writer,

07:09.027 --> 07:12.315
how about texting Zeke and Jimmy
Junior and inviting them over?

07:12.345 --> 07:14.962
I need a Zeke peek.
I'm not allowed to have boys over.

07:14.992 --> 07:16.805
(GROANS) Come on, Tina.

07:16.835 --> 07:18.869
Bring your friend fiction
to life.

Uh...
Come on, do it, do it.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.455
Do it, Do it. Good. Okay, okay.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.701
I'll tell them to get
their butts over here. Yeah.

07:25.731 --> 07:27.443
How do you do
an emoticon for butt? Three.

07:27.473 --> 07:28.840
Three... three...

07:28.913 --> 07:31.229
Oh, I hope you got
a jar to pee in, Gene.

07:31.259 --> 07:33.272
We're gonna be
in here a long time.

07:33.302 --> 07:36.304

Okay. I'll take the other one.

I did it.

07:46.672 --> 07:50.108
Do I look just like Tammy?
This is Tina talking, not Tammy.

07:50.189 --> 07:53.510
Uh, I know who you are.
Oh, 'cause I look like Tammy.

07:53.540 --> 07:56.675
No, not really. When I'm 14,
I'm gonna shave my head bald.

07:56.757 --> 07:58.503
You guys want to play truth
or dare?

07:58.533 --> 08:01.668
Great, good. I dare us all
to drink this!

Margarita Mix!
The heavy stuff!

08:04.195 --> 08:05.941
Cool.
That's my mom's!

08:05.971 --> 08:09.440
I know, I took a little booze
cruise through your living room.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.838
Does margarita mix
have alcohol in it?

08:11.868 --> 08:14.636
No. Mom uses it to fill
the humming bird feeder.

08:14.716 --> 08:18.468
(GULPS) Oh, my God,
I totally feel it.

08:18.569 --> 08:21.622
Whoo! Come on now,
let's kick on some tunes!

08:21.652 --> 08:23.280

Leg's broke. We got to shoot it.
Sorry, Horselain.

Let's shift into
after-party mode.

08:42.424 --> 08:44.825
(TURNS OFF RADIO) Okay, after
party is over. Time to go home.

08:44.859 --> 08:47.305
Come on, Tina. We were just
starting to have fun.

08:47.384 --> 08:49.030
I got to go anyway.
My dad's girlfriend

08:49.060 --> 08:50.470
just had a baby
and she's nursin'.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.681
I want to go check
that stuff out.

08:52.711 --> 08:55.094
I'd check that out with you, Zeke.

(SIGHS) So lame.

Don't tell Mom and Dad.
Okay,

09:09.766 --> 09:12.249
but it's gonna cost you.
$10,000.

for a month!

out of these boots.

Loved it!

Now, I'm craving cake.

No thanks. Ever.

17:55.104 --> 17:56.443
out loud at school?

17:56.478 --> 17:57.588
That's a great idea?

17:57.618 --> 17:59.799
Huh. When you say it like that,

17:59.829 --> 18:01.206
it doesn't sound as good

18:01.236 --> 18:02.703
as when I said it with Tina.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.657
Right, 'cause
she's gonna read...

18:04.687 --> 18:05.780
BOTH: Erotic friend fiction
out loud at school.

18:05.810 --> 18:07.036
Out loud...
Loud...

18:07.066 --> 18:08.493
at school.
At school!

18:08.523 --> 18:10.474
Oh, my God!
What have I done? I'll drive.

18:10.550 --> 18:12.380
Attention, everybody.

18:12.410 --> 18:14.155
It's time for announcements.

18:14.185 --> 18:17.221
The first one is from our
new student, Tammy Larson.

18:17.251 --> 18:18.444
Good afternoon, everybody.

18:18.474 --> 18:19.818
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:19.848 --> 18:21.683
I would like to
present to you a...

18:21.758 --> 18:23.492
What the hell?

18:23.567 --> 18:25.648
Cool! Mom packed
tampons for lunch!

18:25.678 --> 18:26.921
Ooh, share!

18:26.951 --> 18:29.586
I have an announcement.

18:29.616 --> 18:32.098
It's an erotic friend fiction
story that I just wrote.

18:32.128 --> 18:33.888
I hope you like it,
because you're all in it.

18:33.919 --> 18:36.222
It's called "Buttloose."
This is even better.

18:36.299 --> 18:38.297
Tina! Tina!

18:38.327 --> 18:41.210
We got your journal back from
your best friend slash enemy.

18:41.275 --> 18:42.485
I don't need it anymore.

18:42.515 --> 18:43.724
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:43.754 --> 18:45.034
"It was lunch time at Wagstaff."

18:48.060 --> 18:49.572
TINA:
<i>Touching butts had been banned</i>

18:49.602 --> 18:51.136
<i>"by the horrible
Headmaster Frond."</i>

18:51.210 --> 18:53.900
What?
No... no, no, no.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.426
<i>"Suddenly, Tina Belcher
appeared in the doorway."</i>

18:56.503 --> 18:58.015
<i>She knew what she had to do.</i>

18:58.045 --> 18:59.456
<i>She grabbed Jimmy Junior's butt,</i>

18:59.486 --> 19:00.503
<i>"and changed the world."</i>

19:02.351 --> 19:04.013
Okay, Tina,
that was a great story.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.660
Now let's pass back the mike.

19:05.752 --> 19:08.066
"Everyone began to
touch each other's butts.

19:08.096 --> 19:09.809
"Omar touched Jocelyn's butt.

19:09.839 --> 19:11.535
"Chad the Zombie

19:11.565 --> 19:13.042
"touched the butt of that girl
with the frosted hair

19:13.072 --> 19:14.912
from my art class.
I think her name is Kristi."

19:14.944 --> 19:16.694
It's Katie, and ew.

19:16.724 --> 19:18.454
"Even the horrible
Headmaster Frond

19:18.484 --> 19:20.464
touched Ms. Jacobson's butt."
What?

19:20.494 --> 19:22.659
(STAMMERING)

19:22.689 --> 19:24.886
TINA: <i>"Everyone touched
each other's butts,</i>

19:24.916 --> 19:27.337
<i>and it was great."</i> All right,
come here. Come here, come here.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.459
Come here.
Come here, come over here.

19:28.489 --> 19:30.014
"And then Tammy came up to Tina

19:30.044 --> 19:31.684
"and said, 'Sorry for everything.'
Okay...

19:31.736 --> 19:34.096
"Tina said, "That's okay.
Let's go to the movies next week."

19:34.130 --> 19:35.329
"THE END." LINDA: Tina!

19:35.371 --> 19:36.915
Don't read your friend fiction!

19:36.945 --> 19:38.607
But I just finished it.

19:38.637 --> 19:40.182
You're a freak!

19:40.212 --> 19:43.014
(LAUGHING)

19:45.322 --> 19:46.632
(FARTS LOUDLY)

19:46.662 --> 19:48.977
Ooh.
Tammy farted!

19:49.007 --> 19:50.251
Oh, my God!

19:50.281 --> 19:52.529
My ears can smell it!

19:52.559 --> 19:54.007
Laugh fart, laugh fart!

19:54.066 --> 19:55.444
Tammy made a blammy!

19:55.474 --> 19:57.723
Ha ha ha! Gross!

19:57.753 --> 19:59.532
No! It... I didn't do it.
It wasn't my butt.

19:59.562 --> 20:01.759
(FARTS)
That wasn't me.

20:01.789 --> 20:02.731
(FARTING)
No!

20:02.761 --> 20:04.558
Oh, ow, ow, ow.
That one hurt.

20:04.588 --> 20:06.116
That wasn't me!

20:06.146 --> 20:07.666
(FADING INTO DISTANCE):
I didn't do it.

20:07.696 --> 20:09.293
(CRYING, FARTING)

20:09.346 --> 20:10.924
Why are you guys here?

20:10.954 --> 20:13.169
I realised maybe reading
your friend fiction

20:13.199 --> 20:14.994
in front of everyone
wasn't the best idea.

20:15.024 --> 20:16.519
It turned out okay, I think.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.826
No.
No.

20:17.856 --> 20:19.032
Honey...
No, I think it did.

20:19.062 --> 20:20.641
No. No, I'm gonna regret it

20:20.671 --> 20:22.752
for the rest of my life.
I think people liked it.

20:22.782 --> 20:24.683
Man, that girl really farted, huh?
Hey, Tina.

20:24.758 --> 20:27.057
Was the Jimmy Junior in your
story supposed to be me?

20:27.087 --> 20:29.536
Oh, uh... it's a really
common name.

20:29.566 --> 20:31.446
Yeah. It is.
Cool story.

20:31.476 --> 20:32.719
Thanks.

20:32.749 --> 20:34.127
Tina, what was that...

20:34.157 --> 20:35.935
Bob? You're a patty daddy?

20:35.965 --> 20:37.745
I love cake!
Want to cake with me?

20:37.775 --> 20:40.010
Oh. You know,
I'm really not a fan.

20:40.088 --> 20:42.044
A patty cake, a patty cake,
a baker's man! Woo!

20:42.081 --> 20:43.290
Okay, all right.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.613
Work it! That's it.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.021
Got it!
More! Low!

20:46.051 --> 20:47.814
Oh!
High!

20:47.844 --> 20:49.942
Down!

20:49.972 --> 20:51.918
Uh, you guys got to
take this outside.

20:51.948 --> 20:53.443
Let's take it outside.
Okay, let's go.

20:53.473 --> 20:54.565
Hi, see you later.
Okay...

20:54.595 --> 20:56.191
Having your parents at school.

20:56.221 --> 20:59.712
There's nothing more
embarrassing than that.
