00:04.458 --> 00:07.709

00:07.792 --> 00:10.375
<i>♪ Smoke bomb! ♪</i>

00:15.417 --> 00:17.583
Ya! Smoke bomb!

00:17.667 --> 00:19.792
-(explosion)
-Ha ha!

00:21.500 --> 00:24.458
Welcome to the 800th
Annual Norrisville Ninja Day!

00:24.542 --> 00:25.875
Ha ha ha!

00:25.959 --> 00:28.542
I'm your host, hey-yo, Heidi Weinerman.

00:28.625 --> 00:31.208
With me, because my mom said
I had to is Howard.

00:31.291 --> 00:32.667
Ha! Double dip!

00:32.750 --> 00:33.917
Nobody even remembers that.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.500
And give it up
for the Bucky Hensletter orchestra!

00:37.583 --> 00:40.250
(hums silly tune)

00:40.333 --> 00:44.875
Now pound your palms for Norrisville's
favorite hero, the Ninja!

00:44.959 --> 00:47.041
(applause and cheering)

00:47.125 --> 00:50.709
-(man) Love you, Ninja!
-And I love you!

00:50.792 --> 00:52.375
<i>It's an all-dizzle cele-brizzle</i>

00:52.458 --> 00:55.458
<i>of N-Ville's resident bacon saver!</i>

00:55.542 --> 00:58.458
Look at him up there,
peacocking like he deserves this!

00:58.542 --> 01:00.458
<i>I totally deserve this!</i>

01:00.542 --> 01:04.458
Ninja Day! He's so busy buying
his own hype he'll never see us coming.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.208
How's it going down there, Viceroy?

01:06.291 --> 01:09.000
Done. You're welded into your pants.

01:09.083 --> 01:11.291
So if I said I had to pee...

01:11.375 --> 01:12.875
I'd say don't.

01:12.959 --> 01:16.750
McFist, why have you summoned me?

01:16.834 --> 01:19.333
We're just about to kick off
my latest plan.

01:19.417 --> 01:21.250
I call it... What do I call it?

01:21.333 --> 01:23.667
Operation Replace The Ninja
With Lucius O'Thunderpunch

01:23.750 --> 01:26.041
So The Students Of Norrisville
Will Abandon Him

01:26.125 --> 01:27.625
And Put Their Faith
In The Wrong Hero

01:27.709 --> 01:30.208
Thus Rendering Them Helpless
When The Sorcerer Strikes.

01:31.333 --> 01:33.166
I don't know, it feels a little wordy.

01:33.250 --> 01:34.917
I like it.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.750
I love it! Suit me up!

01:40.083 --> 01:41.542
Ahh!

01:45.166 --> 01:46.834
Now we're talkin'!

01:50.709 --> 01:52.375
This isn't only about me.

01:52.458 --> 01:55.542
I mean, I couldn't save you
if you didn't always need saving.

01:55.625 --> 01:57.041
Double dip!

01:57.125 --> 02:00.583
Ninja, you can not be
any Brucer which is why...

02:01.625 --> 02:05.834
The Ninja of the Year award goes to...

02:05.917 --> 02:07.458
Giant robot!

02:08.375 --> 02:12.333
What? Giant robot?
But he wasn't even nominated! Oh.

02:14.166 --> 02:16.500
I'm on it. Keep that plaque
warm for me, P-Slimmy.

02:16.583 --> 02:18.458
I hate it when the students call me that.

02:18.542 --> 02:20.834
But when you say it, Ninja, it just works.

02:20.917 --> 02:22.417
You go, Ninja!

02:22.500 --> 02:24.333
Yeah, Ninja stepped on my head!

02:27.834 --> 02:30.000
(grunts) What the missile?

02:30.083 --> 02:32.208
I know you could've handled that, Ninja.

02:32.291 --> 02:35.333
Just thought I'd lend a hand... cannon.

02:35.417 --> 02:36.959
Mysterious hero zing!

02:37.041 --> 02:38.125
And you are...?

02:38.208 --> 02:40.959
Lucius O'Thunderpunch, at your service!

02:41.041 --> 02:43.208
(cheering)

02:43.291 --> 02:45.917
Lucius O'Thunderpunch,
that's not a real name.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.291
Why it must be, it's all over
these pre-shrunk vintage tees.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.542
(crowd cheering)

02:51.625 --> 02:55.417
Hey, so you probably don't know this,
but it's kind of my day.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.208
Oh, right, here, have a hat.

02:57.291 --> 02:58.333
Ho ho.

02:58.417 --> 03:00.250
Can we get back to Ninja Day?

03:00.333 --> 03:02.917
I believe I was in the middle of accepting
a beautiful plaque.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.375
Viceroy, initiate phase two.

03:05.458 --> 03:09.166
<i>Coming right up,</i>
<i>or should I say down?</i> (snickers)

03:11.125 --> 03:13.375
-(gasping)
-That's a hawkin' comet!

03:13.458 --> 03:16.291
This one's an old favorite of mine.
Ninja Air Fist.

03:16.375 --> 03:19.041
O'Thunderpunch Comet Stopper!

03:19.125 --> 03:21.959
He saved us, with flavor!

03:22.041 --> 03:23.834
Uh, thanks, but I had that.

03:23.917 --> 03:26.375
Ooh, sorry. Just trying to help.

03:26.458 --> 03:28.125
I don't need help. I'm the Ninja.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.000
Looked like you needed some help.

03:30.083 --> 03:32.291
Look, I don't know who you are
or where you came from

03:32.375 --> 03:35.125
but Norrisville already has a hero, a me.

03:35.208 --> 03:38.959
Hey, buddy,
we're all on the same team, eh, buddy.

03:39.041 --> 03:41.041
We are not a team!

03:42.875 --> 03:44.834
Ninja, you blew up my car!

03:44.917 --> 03:47.333
But I...! It was his! (groans)

03:47.417 --> 03:50.125
Don't worry. I'll fix it.

03:54.750 --> 03:57.125
Good as new, Slim-diggity.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.542
I like that even better than P-slims.

03:59.625 --> 04:00.709
(groans)

04:00.792 --> 04:02.542
Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:02.625 --> 04:06.208
Will you stop that?
It's not your day, it's my day!

04:06.291 --> 04:08.667
Ah, not with that attitude it isn't.

04:08.750 --> 04:12.125
I present the Ninja of the Year plaque to

04:12.208 --> 04:13.667
Lucius O'Thunderpunch!

04:13.750 --> 04:14.834
Ooh!

04:14.917 --> 04:17.291
Oh, but he's not even a ninja!

04:17.375 --> 04:21.542
No plaque necessary.
For me, it's not about that.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.542
For me, it's about free fro-yo!

04:29.125 --> 04:31.083
No one's gonna fall for that.

04:31.166 --> 04:36.166
Howard! I protect this school
every honkin' day. These people love me.

04:36.250 --> 04:39.000
No way O'Thunderpunch
is stealing my thunder.

04:44.709 --> 04:46.709
Smoke bomb!

04:49.041 --> 04:50.500
What the juice!

04:50.583 --> 04:53.709
-Thunderpunch!
-Did somebody say snow cone?

04:53.792 --> 04:57.166
(kids cheering)

04:57.250 --> 04:58.792
Pretty sure nobody said snow cone.

04:58.875 --> 05:02.750
Nobody didn't say it. You got
tooti-fruity in that thing, O'T.P.?

05:02.834 --> 05:06.500
Oh! He is stealing my thunder!

05:06.583 --> 05:08.417
Smoke bomb!

05:10.500 --> 05:11.709
Let's do this.

05:11.792 --> 05:16.000
Whoa! Hey! Look out! Hey hey!
Hey, I think that's eight seconds.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.709
I got a beach towel!

05:17.792 --> 05:20.583
What a boss key ring! I wish I had keys.

05:20.667 --> 05:21.667
I got keys!

05:24.750 --> 05:28.291
He's way ahead of you, Ninja.
Decapitation zing!

05:28.375 --> 05:31.583
I can't believe it.
O'Thunderpunch stole my o'thunder.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.458
Aw, Ninja, where are you going?

05:33.542 --> 05:35.375
I was just about to engage

05:35.458 --> 05:36.959
Karaoke Mode!

05:37.041 --> 05:39.583
(crazy music plays)

05:39.667 --> 05:41.875
Fine, you like him so much,

05:41.959 --> 05:44.917
<i>let him protect you. I'm out of here!</i>

05:45.000 --> 05:47.417
Viceroy, it worked! He's gone!

05:47.500 --> 05:49.417
<i>The Ninja's throwing in the scarf!</i>

05:49.500 --> 05:50.583
(clears throat)

05:50.667 --> 05:53.583
Uh, hello, Mr. Sorcerer?

05:54.625 --> 05:55.709
What is it?

05:55.792 --> 05:57.208
The school is all yours.

05:57.291 --> 06:02.542
Tell McFist to find the most
vulnerable student and crush him!

06:02.625 --> 06:04.208
(cackles)

06:04.291 --> 06:05.291
He said...

06:05.375 --> 06:06.875
<i>I heard him!</i>

06:06.959 --> 06:10.959
Um, Mr. O'Thunderpunch,
will you sign my triangle?

06:11.041 --> 06:12.375
You've got it, kid!

06:14.667 --> 06:17.583
-(laughs hysterically)
-You made it a straight angle!

06:17.667 --> 06:20.041
Stupid O'Thunderpunch! Stupid Norrisville!

06:20.125 --> 06:22.375
Stupid not wanting
the Ninja around anymore.

06:22.458 --> 06:25.959
I don't get it, NinjaNomicon,
they're supposed to be celebrating me,

06:26.041 --> 06:28.583
not Limpy O'Blunderdork.

06:35.667 --> 06:37.750
"When the Ninja is no longer needed

06:37.834 --> 06:40.542
the Ninja shall lay down his sword."

06:40.625 --> 06:43.667
So that's it, they decide
they don't need me anymore and I'm done?

06:43.750 --> 06:45.417
You realize how wonk that is?

06:45.500 --> 06:46.333
(growling)

06:52.041 --> 06:54.041
They don't want a Ninja,

06:54.125 --> 06:55.709
they don't have a Ninja.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.834
(video games sounds)

06:59.917 --> 07:01.625
You threw the mask away?

07:01.709 --> 07:04.583
They don't care about the Ninja,
they have O'Thunderpunch now.

07:04.667 --> 07:07.709
So you're quitting?
What happens when Norrisville needs you?

07:07.792 --> 07:09.208
O'Thunderpunch will handle it.

07:09.291 --> 07:12.417
<i>Get ready for to Tug Tug Press.</i>

07:12.500 --> 07:14.583
-(screaming)
-(growling)

07:15.667 --> 07:17.083
Run for your li...!

07:17.166 --> 07:19.375
Why aren't you handling this?

07:19.458 --> 07:21.375
Turning into a monster was his idea.

07:21.458 --> 07:23.709
O'Thunderpunch out!

07:25.375 --> 07:27.750
But we gave you a plaque.

07:27.834 --> 07:30.458
I'm so disappointed.

07:30.542 --> 07:31.834
(growls)

07:31.917 --> 07:33.417
(snickers)

07:33.500 --> 07:36.792
After centuries in this wretched hole,

07:36.875 --> 07:42.041
my chaos will set me free!

07:42.125 --> 07:43.792
(cackles)

07:43.875 --> 07:45.875
-(game plays music)
-Hmm.

07:45.959 --> 07:47.375
Uh... Cunningham?

07:47.458 --> 07:48.875
Hold on, I've gotta press.

07:48.959 --> 07:50.583
Or is it tug?

07:50.667 --> 07:52.250
(video game voice)
<i>You tugged your last luck.</i>

07:54.500 --> 07:55.917
(groans) I knew it was press.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.959
Uh, before you start a new game,
I think you should know

07:59.041 --> 08:00.875
there's a stank-nado over the school!

08:00.959 --> 08:03.792
I'm sure O'Thunderpunch
has it all under control.

08:03.875 --> 08:07.125
You're not gonna do anything just
because he wonked all over your Ninja Day?

08:07.208 --> 08:10.583
They gave him Ninja of the Year!
Howard, not a ninja!

08:10.667 --> 08:14.792
Exactly! He's just some guy
who gives out awesome free stuff.

08:14.875 --> 08:16.667
But he's not a ninja, you are.

08:16.750 --> 08:17.667
They don't want me.

08:17.750 --> 08:20.166
Who cares! They need you.

08:22.542 --> 08:25.125
(Ninja) <i>When the Ninja</i>
<i>is no longer needed...</i>

08:25.208 --> 08:27.792
I thought I had to lay down
my sword because I wasn't needed.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.959
Turns out I just wasn't wanted.

08:30.041 --> 08:32.291
(Howard)
We haven't been wanted lots of times.

08:32.375 --> 08:35.375
We're freshmen!
You should really be used to this by now.

08:35.458 --> 08:38.458
I'm thinking maybe I shouldn't
have thrown my Ninja mask away.

08:38.542 --> 08:42.083
Yes, that was really stupid.
Now let's get it back!

08:42.166 --> 08:43.417
(screaming)

08:43.500 --> 08:47.375
They so need me. Whoa!

08:49.041 --> 08:50.375
Cunningham, mask!

08:51.917 --> 08:54.583
This school needs the Ninja!

08:54.667 --> 08:56.667
(groans) I'm gonna throw up.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.166
You're the shroob who threw it away.

09:00.709 --> 09:02.250
Oh, shnasty!

09:03.583 --> 09:05.083
Ah, yeah, OK!

09:05.166 --> 09:07.875
Ha ha! Hey! Hey!

09:19.333 --> 09:20.500
(grunting)

09:22.166 --> 09:23.291
Oh-oh.

09:25.208 --> 09:27.250
Bring it on!

09:28.917 --> 09:30.625
Boom!

09:30.709 --> 09:31.667
O'Thunderpunch!

09:31.750 --> 09:34.041
Ninja, what are you doing here?

09:34.125 --> 09:35.583
There's a mass stanking going on.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.917
-Why aren't you stopping it?
-I don't feel like it.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.583
Don't feel like it?
Heroes don't get to "Not feel like it".

09:41.667 --> 09:44.959
-Who said I was a hero?
-(gasps)

09:45.583 --> 09:46.709
OK.

09:46.792 --> 09:48.667
Oops! Sorry, wrong cannon.

09:48.750 --> 09:49.583
(gasps)

09:53.375 --> 09:54.792
Ninja Missile Snatch!

09:56.333 --> 09:58.500
Yikes!

10:01.792 --> 10:03.875
I bailed on the school. And you?

10:03.959 --> 10:07.792
Well, you're a jerktastic shoob. Mm-hmm.

10:07.875 --> 10:11.000
Looks like nobody's
getting Ninja of the Year this year.

10:11.083 --> 10:13.500
Ninja plaque Slash!

10:16.542 --> 10:21.083
Ninja!

10:21.166 --> 10:24.917
Wow! So... that happened.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.917
Yeah, just glad you're all OK.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.542
That guy's no hero. He didn't
do anything. Ninja saved the day.

10:31.625 --> 10:32.667
And he yelled at me.

10:32.750 --> 10:35.542
He didn't give two hoots
about us during that monster attack.

10:35.625 --> 10:37.875
-Yeah!
-We love you, Ninja!

10:37.959 --> 10:41.709
Whoa, hey, look at the time.
I'm gonna jetpack!

10:43.542 --> 10:46.959
It's OK, you can eat the tacos.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.250
-(cheering)
-Tacos!

10:49.333 --> 10:50.875
Mmm.

10:50.959 --> 10:53.917
Thanks, man. I got so caught up
in wanting to be wanted,

10:54.000 --> 10:55.667
I forgot what it meant to be needed.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.500
What? All I heard was me chewing.

10:57.583 --> 10:59.500
Smoke bomb, buddy, smoke bomb.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.208
Yah!

11:02.959 --> 11:05.125
(Randy) The McFistival of Pride parade,

11:05.208 --> 11:08.375
the crown jewel
of the Norrisville parade season.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.583
And when we shred
all over the school float...

11:10.667 --> 11:12.792
It's gonna melt everyone's faces off.

11:12.875 --> 11:15.834
Norrisville, are you ready for...

11:15.917 --> 11:18.709
30 Seconds to Math!

11:18.792 --> 11:21.583
(heavy metal music)

11:23.250 --> 11:25.000
They aren't ready, none of 'em.

11:25.083 --> 11:28.041
-Not Heidi, not Bash, not Stevens.
-Not Bagel.

11:28.125 --> 11:30.500
Definitely not Bagel. Who is Bagel?

11:30.583 --> 11:34.166
Are you kidding me? Ranginald Bagel,
the most annoying kid in school.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.000
Thinks he's a standup comedian.

11:36.083 --> 11:39.375
-Morgan, stop me if you've heard this one.
-Stop.

11:39.458 --> 11:41.959
Why can't a sunken ship be in a parade?

11:42.041 --> 11:44.917
'Cause it won't stay afloat!

11:45.000 --> 11:48.500
Get it? Afloat! (laughs maniacally)

11:48.583 --> 11:50.667
That kid's name is not Ranginald Bagel.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.792
No one's name is Ranginald Bagel.

11:52.875 --> 11:55.000
I'm Ranginald Bagel! You've been great!

11:55.083 --> 11:58.917
Now, if you'll all excuse me,
I've gotta take five to make two,

11:59.000 --> 12:00.792
if you know what I mean.

12:02.792 --> 12:05.166
What I mean is I've gotta take a poop.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.834
Ranginald, just go.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.917
Good night, everybody!

12:09.000 --> 12:10.500
Wow, this is bad.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.625
Oh, wait till he does his cafeteria bit.

12:12.709 --> 12:14.834
Twenty minutes on how chili isn't cold!

12:14.917 --> 12:17.625
No, I mean,
remember when we were bro-snatched

12:17.709 --> 12:19.792
by that swamp wizard Catfish Booray?

12:21.458 --> 12:24.583
-(gasps)
-Well, how you doing over there, partner?

12:24.667 --> 12:25.917
My name Catfish.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.583
Hello, Mr. Catfish.
My name is Ranginald Bagel.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.542
Ranginald Bagel, that's me.

12:32.542 --> 12:35.166
So he thinks your name
is Ranginald Bagel, so what?

12:35.250 --> 12:37.917
So Booray saw me transform
into you know who.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.208
-Who?
-The Ninja.

12:40.291 --> 12:43.166
-Mmm.
-He thinks Ranginald Bagel is the Ninja.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.917
I've gotta go to the swamp
and set him straight.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.083
I'll admit,
usually you wonk everything up,

12:47.166 --> 12:49.709
but this one, I think we're good.

12:49.792 --> 12:52.083
No way it's coming back to eat our cheese.

12:52.917 --> 12:55.375
You're right. I mean, it's ridiculous.

12:55.458 --> 12:58.959
Booray and McFist in the same
place at the same time. (chuckles)

12:59.041 --> 13:02.625
(Viceroy) I was just enjoying
my all-you-can-eat crawdads the other day

13:02.709 --> 13:07.000
when I overheard Mr. Booray here
making a rather convincing case how...

13:07.083 --> 13:09.333
I know who the Ninja be.

13:09.417 --> 13:12.583
That skinny mullet
done sliced up my gris-gris.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.875
Mm, these lobsters are great, Viceroy.

13:14.959 --> 13:17.166
Don't know why they make them
so small but I like 'em!

13:17.250 --> 13:21.125
Sir, we took two canoes
and a fan boat to get down here.

13:21.208 --> 13:23.375
Isn't there something you wanted to ask?

13:23.458 --> 13:24.750
(clears throat) Yes.

13:24.834 --> 13:26.875
Do these come with hush puppies?

13:26.959 --> 13:30.458
Oh, I'm awful glad you asked that,
Mr. Robot Hand.

13:30.542 --> 13:33.333
You know them hush puppies,
they don't come with it.

13:33.417 --> 13:37.208
They're an extra charge.
But they're worth it. (chuckles)

13:37.291 --> 13:40.125
(sighs) Something besides hush puppies.

13:40.208 --> 13:41.959
Right. So who's the Ninja?

13:42.041 --> 13:44.625
You bring what I asked for?

13:44.709 --> 13:46.583
Ooh, McFistPad!

13:46.667 --> 13:49.041
Ha! This the new one, right?

13:49.125 --> 13:51.667
Of course it's the new one!
Now tell us who the Ninja is!

13:51.750 --> 13:53.500
The Ninja be...

13:53.583 --> 13:55.667
Ranginald Bagel!

13:55.750 --> 13:58.667
(cackling maniacally)

13:58.750 --> 14:03.000
Right! I'm in! Viceroy, bring me
the head of Ranginald Bagel?

14:03.083 --> 14:05.709
Also, wanna go halfsers on another bucket?

14:06.667 --> 14:08.542
I can't believe
I almost skipped the parade

14:08.625 --> 14:10.959
to prevent something
that could never happen.

14:12.500 --> 14:16.166
Probably wants to congratulate me
for keeping myself out of trouble.

14:19.166 --> 14:20.458
Whoa!

14:20.542 --> 14:21.875
What the juice?

14:27.375 --> 14:30.333
(Randy) "The Ninja who looks the other way
fails to see the attack."

14:30.417 --> 14:31.375
Got it, NinjaNomicon.

14:31.458 --> 14:33.542
If there's an attack,
I'll keep my eyes open.

14:33.625 --> 14:36.333
But since there isn't,
I've got a parade to get to.

14:38.083 --> 14:41.041
So is there like a button to vloop
out of here? Like a switch?

14:41.583 --> 14:43.625
Nomicon says we're all good.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.083
Wow, that's a load off.

14:45.166 --> 14:47.125
Now let's deal with something important.

14:47.208 --> 14:50.500
Serpentine or Reverse
Upstairs-Downstairs Hurricane.

14:50.583 --> 14:53.166
Why give the crowd half a show? Do both.

14:53.250 --> 14:54.875
(screaming)

14:57.417 --> 14:59.417
Where is Ranginald Bagel?

14:59.500 --> 15:01.250
He went to the lavatory.

15:01.417 --> 15:02.667
(screams)

15:05.333 --> 15:07.291
(gasps) You're gonna Ninja-out,
aren't you?

15:07.375 --> 15:10.000
It'll be fine. We don't perform till 3:30.

15:10.083 --> 15:13.208
And by my watch, it's only Ninja o'clock.

15:13.291 --> 15:14.750
-I'll meet you on the float.
-No!

15:14.834 --> 15:16.417
Don't forget my guitar!

15:16.500 --> 15:18.208
(groans)

15:20.583 --> 15:21.959
(groans)

15:22.041 --> 15:23.583
(chuckles) I popped it!

15:23.667 --> 15:25.542
(groans) I hate this.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.750
Oh, don't be such a Grumpy Gabe.

15:27.834 --> 15:29.750
Show everyone that big smile of yours.

15:29.834 --> 15:33.875
Operation Sliced Bagel
proceeding according to plan.

15:33.959 --> 15:35.000
(snickers)

15:35.083 --> 15:38.083
Oh, now that's my happy Hanny.

15:38.166 --> 15:39.250
(chuckles) Yeah!

15:39.333 --> 15:40.417
(monkey screeches)

15:40.500 --> 15:41.750
Ha!

15:41.834 --> 15:44.125
Destroy Ranginald Bagel!

15:44.208 --> 15:45.375
Ninja Tripping Balls!

15:46.959 --> 15:48.041
Hi-ya!

15:48.125 --> 15:49.792
Ha!

15:50.875 --> 15:52.875
Destroy Ranginald Bagel!

15:52.959 --> 15:54.458
(groans)

15:54.542 --> 15:57.166
...and he said... Ninja!

15:57.250 --> 15:59.583
Great to see you
in the second floor bathroom.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.291
Here's one for you:

16:01.375 --> 16:02.583
when is a Ninja good

16:02.667 --> 16:05.291
-at sticking things on a wall.
-No time.

16:05.375 --> 16:08.250
Don't panic, a robot wants to destroy
you because he thinks you're me.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.208
Make that "robots".

16:11.250 --> 16:13.375
When you a tack! Get it?

16:13.458 --> 16:16.041
A tack! (laughs)

16:16.125 --> 16:17.250
I'm sorry, what now?

16:17.333 --> 16:19.333
A killer robot is coming to get you!

16:19.417 --> 16:21.542
Destroy Ranginald Bagel!

16:21.625 --> 16:23.375
You've been great, everybody! Good night!

16:23.458 --> 16:24.542
No wait, check it.

16:24.625 --> 16:25.917
Ninja, Ranginald Bagel,

16:26.000 --> 16:27.291
same place, same time.

16:27.375 --> 16:29.417
Not the same person. Call off the attack.

16:30.125 --> 16:32.166
Destroy Ranginald Bagel!

16:36.417 --> 16:38.875
Maybe it doesn't appreciate comedy.

16:38.959 --> 16:40.792
(screaming)

16:40.875 --> 16:44.667
And I thought the cafeteria
on chipped beef day was a tough room.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.625
Nothing, nothing on chipped beef.

16:47.709 --> 16:49.417
How can you make
jokes at a time like this?

16:49.500 --> 16:52.500
It's a defense mechanism,
I do it when I'm nervous

16:52.583 --> 16:56.041
or happy or if there's silence,
that's the worst.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.041
Destroy Ranginald Bagel!

16:58.125 --> 17:00.500
I totally wonked it.
Those bots'll keep coming

17:00.583 --> 17:03.125
till I prove to McFist
that Ranginald's not the Ninja.

17:03.208 --> 17:05.959
(gasps) That's it, the McFistival parade!

17:06.041 --> 17:07.917
No idea what you're talking about.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.917
But I got six solid minutes on parades.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.083
-Let's go!
-Destroy Ranginald Bagel!

17:15.166 --> 17:17.166
This is the most boring race ever.

17:17.250 --> 17:18.834
(Marci) I don't think it's a race.

17:18.917 --> 17:20.792
Whatever it is, make it go faster!

17:20.875 --> 17:25.083
That's no balloon!
That's my sister! (laughs)

17:25.166 --> 17:27.375
See, six minutes on parades!

17:27.375 --> 17:28.792
Longest six minutes of my life.

17:28.875 --> 17:32.458
That's because it was seven!

17:32.542 --> 17:36.542
So you think we lost those robots or what?

17:36.625 --> 17:38.542
-I'm gonna go with, "or what?"
-Ha!

17:38.625 --> 17:41.041
"Or what?" That's great!

17:41.125 --> 17:42.709
-Can I steal that?
-No!

17:45.583 --> 17:46.500
(sighs)

17:46.583 --> 17:48.417
Destroy Ranginald Bagel!

17:53.583 --> 17:56.291
My balloons, they go pop pop.

17:58.792 --> 18:00.166
Hmm.

18:00.250 --> 18:04.208
Hey, everybody,
looks like Weinerman got abandoned.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.709
-Kick him when he's down zing!
-(laughter)

18:06.792 --> 18:09.250
Wrong per U, flute girl.

18:09.333 --> 18:12.291
I'm just gonna get everyone
warmed up with a sweet drum solo.

18:12.375 --> 18:13.917
Then it's face-melting time.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.458
-(electronic drums play)
-Drum solo,

18:16.542 --> 18:18.125
classic Weinerman stall.

18:18.208 --> 18:21.500
Just keep 'em busy, buddy.
I'll be there soon.

18:21.583 --> 18:23.125
Oh-oh!

18:23.208 --> 18:24.583
(screams)

18:26.458 --> 18:28.625
Axe and you shall receive.

18:28.709 --> 18:30.083
Ha! I'm stealing that one!

18:30.166 --> 18:33.542
No you're not! Ninja Boom Ball!

18:35.083 --> 18:36.750
Bring it on!

18:36.834 --> 18:40.333
Ranginald Bagel's Ninja's out.
Why didn't you plan for that?

18:40.417 --> 18:44.041
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, wait, I did. (chuckles)

18:48.709 --> 18:51.583
(shrieking)

18:56.458 --> 18:57.542
Hey! Ow!

19:01.375 --> 19:02.792
Ninja Air Fist!

19:05.583 --> 19:08.125
-Ranginald?
-(whimpering)

19:08.208 --> 19:11.083
-Ranginald, you OK?
-(gasps)

19:11.166 --> 19:12.792
(bawling)

19:12.875 --> 19:14.250
You got a joke for me there, Rang?

19:14.333 --> 19:17.250
A joke? You want a joke?

19:17.333 --> 19:21.333
I was almost sliced
in two by a giant robot!

19:21.417 --> 19:24.625
Pardon me if I don't find
the humor in that!

19:25.750 --> 19:29.667
I just wanna make people laugh!

19:29.750 --> 19:32.959
Wait a minute.
Ranginald, I think I can fix this,

19:33.041 --> 19:36.125
but I need you to make people laugh.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.959
Think you can do that for me, buddy?

19:38.041 --> 19:40.333
Have you heard the one about...?

19:40.417 --> 19:42.458
No no! Save it.

19:42.542 --> 19:44.625
(drums playing)

19:46.542 --> 19:49.792
Ninja, thank cheese! De-suit and we can...

19:49.875 --> 19:53.083
-What's he doing here?
-Say hello to your new opening act.

19:53.166 --> 19:56.041
Norrisville, prepare yourself for...

19:56.125 --> 19:59.041
the comedy stylings of Ranginald Bagel

19:59.125 --> 20:00.583
-Ranginald Bagel!
-Ranginald Bagel!

20:00.667 --> 20:01.709
Ranginald Bagel!

20:01.792 --> 20:03.750
Ranginald Bagel is my name,

20:03.834 --> 20:07.417
and comedy is the thing
that I do that rhymes with "name."

20:07.500 --> 20:08.709
What have you done?

20:08.792 --> 20:11.750
I know we wanted this,
Howard, but he needs it.

20:11.834 --> 20:14.041
Two robo-apes walk into a building

20:14.125 --> 20:16.625
You think one of them would've seen it!

20:16.709 --> 20:18.083
Ha ha ha.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.667
But the Ninja's... and Ranginald's...

20:19.750 --> 20:21.834
Ranginald Bagel can't be the Ninja!

20:21.917 --> 20:24.375
I knew that swamp elf was nuts!

20:24.458 --> 20:26.166
-Oh, this isn't over yet.
-(alarm sounds)

20:26.250 --> 20:27.959
Destroy Ninja!

20:31.208 --> 20:34.083
"The Ninja who looks
the other way fails to see the attack."

20:34.166 --> 20:36.000
Destroy Ninja!

20:36.083 --> 20:39.625
But I'm looking right at the attack.
I see it. How do I stop it?

20:40.375 --> 20:42.375
Looks the other way.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.792
Ninja Wisdom Flip!

20:51.166 --> 20:54.917
(crowd chanting) Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!

20:55.000 --> 20:56.333
(groans)

20:56.375 --> 20:59.583
Well, on the bright side,
this was the best parade ever.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.500
I hate the bright side!

21:01.583 --> 21:05.625
Ranginald got our glory and the McFistival
of Pride parade went up in flames.

21:05.709 --> 21:07.875
I hope you learned
something from all this.

21:07.959 --> 21:09.959
Oh, I did. And that is...

21:10.041 --> 21:13.458
That is... Hang on a second,
it'll come to me.

21:13.542 --> 21:15.458
(Ranginald) Did you hear
the one about the robo-ape

21:15.542 --> 21:17.667
who got fired from the banana farm?

21:17.750 --> 21:20.083
He was throwing out all the bent ones.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.458
That joke is offensive.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.375
-Get him!
-(Ranginald screams)

21:25.583 --> 21:27.083
Uh, it's on the tip of my tongue.

21:27.166 --> 21:28.333
I know I learned something.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.625
(Ranginald)
I kid! I kid! That's what I do!

21:30.709 --> 21:33.834
You know what? As soon as I rescue
Ranginald I'm sure I'll remember it.

21:35.250 --> 21:39.208
Rescue Ranginald!
Don't look the other way! Lesson learned!

21:39.291 --> 21:40.875
(Ranginald screams)

21:40.959 --> 21:42.625
(groans) Would you go help him?

21:42.709 --> 21:44.875
Right, I'm on it! Ya!

21:44.959 --> 21:47.333
(Ranginald) Good night, everybody!

21:47.917 --> 21:50.000
(theme music plays)
