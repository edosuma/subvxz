Previously on
<i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:02.307 --> 00:04.749
I don't know what
your alien friends did to you,

00:04.774 --> 00:07.023
but I for one
do not want to find out.

00:07.048 --> 00:08.773
We are fighting
the same enemy.

00:08.930 --> 00:10.355
If the rebellion
isn't real,

00:10.380 --> 00:12.134
then nothing that's happened
makes any sense.

00:12.159 --> 00:13.982
If the Skitters are gonna
overthrow their Masters...

00:14.007 --> 00:15.804
Maybe it could be true.

00:15.829 --> 00:17.175
Look, I don't know
what you're plotting,

00:17.200 --> 00:19.271
but I'd rather swallow glass
than be a part of it.

00:19.296 --> 00:20.523
Charleston

00:20.623 --> 00:22.737
We've been promised
paradise before

00:22.762 --> 00:24.425
There's no way to know for sure.

00:24.450 --> 00:25.421
Who goes there?

00:25.446 --> 00:27.562
Colonel Porter,
First Continental Army.

00:27.587 --> 00:29.318
Let's go to Charleston.

00:32.677 --> 00:34.344
Can't tell you
how proud I am

00:34.379 --> 00:36.245
of the way you guys kept
the 2nd Mass in the fight.

00:36.279 --> 00:38.514
Last we heard, your unit
was taking some pretty heavy fire.

00:38.548 --> 00:40.414
Yeah, Mechs
tore the hell out of us.

00:40.448 --> 00:42.949
We put up a fight, but in the end,
only five survived.

00:42.984 --> 00:45.217
All we could do
was patch up the wounded,

00:45.252 --> 00:47.620
bury the dead, and try
to make our way down here.

00:52.425 --> 00:54.459
We're basically
in a defensive posture,

00:54.494 --> 00:55.895
just staying off
the alien grid.

00:55.929 --> 00:57.864
How'd anyone
even find this place?

00:57.898 --> 00:59.198
Dumb luck.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.333
This place
was under construction

01:00.368 --> 01:01.535
when they hit the city.

01:01.570 --> 01:03.672
Everything topside
was destroyed.

01:03.707 --> 01:07.243
Everything down below...
survived.

01:43.950 --> 01:46.953
What the hell
they staring at?

02:01.437 --> 02:03.438
2nd Mass, welcome!

02:06.576 --> 02:09.412
Looks like your reputation
precedes you, folks.

02:09.446 --> 02:11.414
Welcome to Charleston.

02:14.852 --> 02:16.320
Happy to have you!

02:39.747 --> 02:41.715
Mm. Thanks.
Looks good.

02:41.749 --> 02:43.017
All right. Thanks.

02:43.051 --> 02:45.452
Quite a spread.

02:45.487 --> 02:48.021
Dad?

02:48.055 --> 02:49.022
Dad!

02:49.057 --> 02:51.525
Jeanne?

02:51.560 --> 02:54.395
Hey! Hey!

02:54.429 --> 02:55.663
Oh, my goodness.

02:55.697 --> 02:56.764
You're alive.

02:56.799 --> 02:58.700
Yeah.

03:01.504 --> 03:04.473
It's all right.
It's all right.

03:04.507 --> 03:06.341
Scouts said they found survivors
from the 2nd Mass.

03:06.376 --> 03:07.943
I was so scared
that you wouldn't be with them.

03:07.977 --> 03:09.411
You can't get rid of me
that easy.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.618
Hey...

03:14.652 --> 03:17.687
Hey,
how'd you get here?

03:17.722 --> 03:19.590
Where's your boyfriend?

03:22.127 --> 03:25.396
He got all messed up
when we left Richmond, Dad.

03:29.935 --> 03:32.370
Don't disappear on me
again, okay?

03:32.405 --> 03:34.506
Okay.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.844
"Charleston Arbor."

03:38.878 --> 03:40.913
Must have been building some
kind of crazy underground mall.

03:40.947 --> 03:43.049
They even rigged up
some running water.

03:45.085 --> 03:46.953
Pray to God
that means showers.

03:46.987 --> 03:49.722
You passed your sell-by date
like 400 miles ago.

03:49.756 --> 03:51.757
Yeah, well,
so, how long do we wait

03:51.791 --> 03:54.159
till we put this, uh, hole
in the rearview?

03:54.194 --> 03:56.562
Trust me --
I have no intentions

03:56.596 --> 04:00.666
on making Mayberry
my permanent residence.

04:00.701 --> 04:01.834
This way!

04:01.869 --> 04:03.570
Look at all these kids.

04:03.604 --> 04:05.571
Do you think
that they have a school here,

04:05.606 --> 04:07.440
like we did before?

04:07.474 --> 04:09.442
Be surprised
if they didn't.

04:10.477 --> 04:12.111
Go ahead.
Check it out.

04:12.145 --> 04:13.779
Just stay close,
okay?

04:13.814 --> 04:15.615
Okay.

04:17.785 --> 04:19.819
Fresh bread,
green beans, corn.

04:19.853 --> 04:22.120
It's been a while since we could
pick and choose, huh?

04:22.156 --> 04:24.424
I see you passed
on the Brussels sprouts.

04:24.458 --> 04:25.525
And the spinach.

04:25.559 --> 04:27.494
Like I said,
it's been a while.

04:27.528 --> 04:28.728
Tom Mason.

04:28.763 --> 04:30.831
Boston College,
Maloney Hall,

04:30.865 --> 04:34.535
second row, left,
and always an aisle seat.

04:35.771 --> 04:37.839
Just in case
I had to sneak out early.

04:37.874 --> 04:40.876
As I recall,
you never dared.

04:40.910 --> 04:41.877
Tom.

04:46.183 --> 04:49.451
Um, Anne, this is
Arthur Manchester...

04:49.486 --> 04:50.953
Hello.

04:50.988 --> 04:52.588
...chairman of B.C.'s
American History Department

04:52.623 --> 04:53.856
back in the day.

04:53.891 --> 04:55.792
And he's right --
I never missed a lecture.

04:55.826 --> 04:57.861
I hope our people
are treating you well.

04:57.895 --> 04:59.962
To be honest,
I'm overwhelmed.

04:59.997 --> 05:02.098
Arthur also wrote
"From Darkness, Democracy,"

05:02.132 --> 05:03.899
which is
one of the best histories

05:03.934 --> 05:05.467
on the Revolutionary War.

05:05.502 --> 05:07.737
Clearly, lessons
you're putting into practice.

05:07.771 --> 05:11.541
The new United States
of America, in which you are...

05:11.575 --> 05:14.243
Majority leader.
"President" felt presumptuous.

05:14.278 --> 05:16.145
We're still very much
a work in progress.

05:16.180 --> 05:17.947
You know
I've got a million questions.

05:17.981 --> 05:20.182
And I'm eager to hear
about your encounter

05:20.216 --> 05:22.184
with this
Overlord creature.

05:23.186 --> 05:24.819
But we're gonna have
plenty of time to talk.

05:24.854 --> 05:26.755
And I'm betting your people
haven't seen a real bed

05:26.789 --> 05:27.889
in quite a while.

05:27.923 --> 05:29.491
Or hot food,
clean clothes.

05:29.525 --> 05:30.892
Speaking of which,

05:30.926 --> 05:32.760
I had my son Matt
make this up just in case.

05:32.795 --> 05:34.195
This is the names
of everybody in the 2nd Mass,

05:34.229 --> 05:35.964
along with
their assignments.

05:35.998 --> 05:37.665
I'll get our housing committee
working on this right away.

05:38.967 --> 05:42.771
Tom, I can't tell you
how happy I am that you're here.

05:42.805 --> 05:45.540
Charleston could use
a man like you.

05:47.076 --> 05:51.112
Wait till
that generator's working.

05:51.146 --> 05:53.147
Gents, General Bressler.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.618
General.

05:57.653 --> 06:01.722
Captain Daniel Weaver,
2nd Massachusetts, reporting.

06:03.859 --> 06:05.660
Gunnery Sergeant
Aloysius Murphy,

06:05.694 --> 06:07.562
United States Marine Corps,
sir.

06:08.597 --> 06:10.097
At ease, gentlemen.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.068
Porter's told me a lot
about your unit.

06:15.103 --> 06:17.938
Congratulations
on making it through.

06:17.973 --> 06:21.108
I'd say
you've earned this.

06:21.142 --> 06:23.210
Appreciate that, sir.

06:23.244 --> 06:25.745
I had a quick look at your men,
at your ordnance.

06:25.780 --> 06:28.281
I'd say you've put together
a hell of a fighting force.

06:28.315 --> 06:29.816
We can always find a place
for more, hmm?

06:29.850 --> 06:31.718
If I may...

06:31.752 --> 06:33.252
Go right ahead, Captain.

06:36.056 --> 06:39.758
2nd Mass executed ambushes
against the aliens

06:39.793 --> 06:42.828
in Connecticut, Richmond.

06:42.862 --> 06:46.098
And we've been tracking
enemy activity

06:46.133 --> 06:48.733
all the way
down the line...

06:48.768 --> 06:49.834
here in Concord...

06:49.869 --> 06:53.104
even in Florence.

06:53.138 --> 06:55.572
If you need our people
to scout for you,

06:55.607 --> 06:56.674
just say the word.

06:56.708 --> 06:57.941
Appreciate the intel,
Captain,

06:57.976 --> 06:59.710
but we won't be needing
your scouts.

06:59.744 --> 07:01.712
General,
these 2nd Mass people

07:01.746 --> 07:03.614
have got
actionable intelligence.

07:03.648 --> 07:05.715
Colonel Porter,
your opinion is noted.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.250
You're dismissed.

07:11.388 --> 07:13.088
Yes, sir.

07:24.633 --> 07:29.736
Let me, uh,
lay it out for you.

07:29.771 --> 07:33.906
The aliens have no reason
to attack Charleston again.

07:33.941 --> 07:36.242
As far as they know,
the city's been neutralized.

07:36.277 --> 07:38.712
Given that,
our civilian authorities

07:38.746 --> 07:41.647
decided to use the lull
to regroup and rebuild.

07:41.682 --> 07:43.149
Until that changes,

07:43.183 --> 07:45.651
we're not in the business
of picking fights.

07:45.686 --> 07:47.754
The civilian leader
Manchester --

07:47.788 --> 07:50.157
he calls the shots
for the military, too?

07:50.191 --> 07:51.859
As he'll be happy
to remind you,

07:51.893 --> 07:55.796
he does have 230 years of
American tradition on his side.

07:55.830 --> 07:58.766
Manchester was
one of the first settlers

07:58.800 --> 08:01.035
and wound up becoming
their leader by default.

08:01.069 --> 08:03.771
But as
our numbers grew,

08:03.805 --> 08:05.773
he made sure
his people knew who to thank

08:05.807 --> 08:09.177
for their three squares a day,
full bellies.

08:09.211 --> 08:10.645
It made him very popular.

08:10.680 --> 08:11.913
Captain Weaver!

08:11.948 --> 08:14.316
Captain,
you better get out here.

08:20.090 --> 08:22.658
Calm down!
Nothing's been decided yet!

08:22.693 --> 08:23.893
Damn it,
I am ordering you

08:23.927 --> 08:25.661
to step back
and allow us to continue.

08:25.695 --> 08:27.129
I don't take your orders,
Sergeant.

08:27.164 --> 08:28.964
And I'm not letting you
split these people up

08:28.999 --> 08:30.232
or disarm them
without a reason!

08:30.266 --> 08:31.800
What the hell
is going on here?

08:31.835 --> 08:33.268
Captain, they're spreading
the 2nd Mass out

08:33.303 --> 08:35.102
across a dozen
different housing areas.

08:35.138 --> 08:37.072
This is not a damn resort!
You will go where you are told!

08:37.106 --> 08:39.006
You better back off!

08:39.041 --> 08:40.808
At ease!
At ease, Sergeant Clemons.

08:40.842 --> 08:42.210
Jim?

08:42.244 --> 08:45.113
These people have had
each other's backs for months.

08:45.147 --> 08:46.715
I understand that.

08:46.749 --> 08:49.117
And you've got to understand
this isn't punitive.

08:49.152 --> 08:51.953
Down here, we store all
the weapons in a central area,

08:51.988 --> 08:53.755
and then we issue them
according to mission.

08:53.789 --> 08:56.124
We're just salting your people
in where they belong.

08:56.158 --> 08:59.093
Now, that said,
you tell me "no way,"

08:59.127 --> 09:00.995
I'll back your position.

09:16.979 --> 09:18.112
Hold on!

09:20.249 --> 09:22.985
I may not like it,

09:23.019 --> 09:25.755
but the Colonel
is making sense.

09:28.092 --> 09:30.927
We're here now.

09:30.962 --> 09:32.429
We're in Charleston.

09:36.167 --> 09:37.901
We're in Charleston.

09:42.940 --> 09:44.174
Tom.

09:47.445 --> 09:49.379
No,
Captain Weaver's right.

09:51.448 --> 09:53.883
We need to start thinking
beyond the 2nd Mass now.

09:53.917 --> 09:54.884
Good.

09:54.918 --> 09:56.452
Carry on,
Sergeant Clemons.

09:56.487 --> 09:58.054
Yes, sir.

10:38.894 --> 10:40.861
It's <i>the South Carolina</i>
<i>Gazette.</i>

10:40.896 --> 10:42.829
You're kidding.

10:44.498 --> 10:45.999
And an invitation.

10:47.501 --> 10:50.003
Arthur wants to see me
first thing.

10:50.037 --> 10:53.607
So much for sleeping in.

10:53.641 --> 10:58.545
I'm assigned to the
medical clinic with Lourdes.

10:58.579 --> 11:01.781
Look at us -- commuters
on our way to the office.

11:01.816 --> 11:05.151
If I had a pot,
I'd make us some coffee.

11:05.186 --> 11:07.787
If I had a cup,
I'd drink it.

11:12.860 --> 11:14.961
Tom. Come in.

11:23.938 --> 11:25.505
Hmm.

11:25.539 --> 11:27.807
Go ahead. Take one.

11:27.841 --> 11:29.943
They look delicious.

11:29.977 --> 11:31.177
You grew these here?

11:31.212 --> 11:33.246
First crop
from our hydroponic garden.

11:34.782 --> 11:36.650
Another baby step
toward self-sufficiency.

11:38.086 --> 11:42.056
So, tell me -- what do you think
of Charleston so far?

11:42.091 --> 11:44.592
I think if you'd asked me
that question three days ago,

11:44.627 --> 11:45.860
I never
would have believed

11:45.895 --> 11:47.862
a place like this
was even possible.

11:47.897 --> 11:51.533
It's a new beginning, Tom --
from the ground up,

11:51.567 --> 11:54.068
and that includes
forming a true government.

11:54.103 --> 11:57.638
So I heard
from your pilot -- Avery.

11:57.673 --> 11:58.940
Hell of a woman.

11:58.974 --> 12:01.676
Your book --
"From Darkness, Democracy."

12:01.710 --> 12:04.612
Go ahead.
You can keep that.

12:04.646 --> 12:08.215
Our founding fathers
had remarkable foresight,

12:08.250 --> 12:11.919
but not even <i>they</i> could have
imagined an alien attack.

12:11.954 --> 12:14.088
We're going to need
a political system

12:14.123 --> 12:17.792
designed for
a post-invasion world, Tom.

12:17.826 --> 12:20.995
We could be like
Washington and Jefferson,

12:22.331 --> 12:24.632
founders
of a new democracy.

12:24.666 --> 12:25.900
I have to admit --

12:25.934 --> 12:28.269
the historian in me
is intrigued.

12:28.303 --> 12:30.638
I'm happy to hear it,

12:30.673 --> 12:33.140
because you come
at a critical moment.

12:33.175 --> 12:36.043
There's a confidence vote
scheduled for tomorrow --

12:36.077 --> 12:38.846
a referendum
on my leadership.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.280
It's pro forma,
really --

12:40.315 --> 12:42.016
a chance for the settlers
to blow off some steam.

12:42.050 --> 12:44.018
I can't imagine
you would have a problem.

12:44.052 --> 12:46.988
But I could always use
another arrow in my quiver.

12:47.022 --> 12:49.090
I'm hoping
you would stand with me.

12:52.695 --> 12:53.996
I'd be honored, Arthur.

12:54.030 --> 12:56.031
I'll be there, of course.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.036
Although, I think
you may want to reconsider

13:00.070 --> 13:01.871
after you hear
what I have to tell you.

13:01.905 --> 13:04.073
Now <i>I'm</i> intrigued.

13:04.108 --> 13:05.074
May I?

13:05.108 --> 13:06.175
Please.

13:07.377 --> 13:09.345
We've had several encounters
with the aliens

13:09.379 --> 13:11.180
over the last few weeks.

13:11.214 --> 13:13.849
And I know it's hard to believe,
but we think...

13:13.884 --> 13:16.752
that a group of them have
turned against the Overlords.

13:16.787 --> 13:17.954
"Turned," meaning...

13:17.988 --> 13:20.256
Meaning that
the Skitters were enslaved,

13:20.290 --> 13:22.124
just like
our harnessed kids,

13:22.159 --> 13:24.126
and that a few of them
want to fight back

13:24.161 --> 13:25.628
just as much <i>we</i> do.

13:25.662 --> 13:27.029
Well, so far,
this sounds like good news.

13:27.063 --> 13:28.364
All we have to do
is stand back

13:28.398 --> 13:30.199
and let the bastards
kill each other off.

13:30.233 --> 13:32.034
Or we can ally
with the rebel Skitters

13:32.068 --> 13:34.036
and hit the Overlords
with everything we got.

13:34.070 --> 13:35.937
You're serious?

13:35.972 --> 13:37.772
Mm-hmm.

13:37.807 --> 13:39.107
Trust the Skitters?

13:39.141 --> 13:40.708
If I hadn't lived through
the last couple weeks,

13:40.743 --> 13:42.110
I would be
just as skeptical.

13:42.144 --> 13:43.844
It's one of the reasons
we wanted to keep this quiet

13:43.879 --> 13:45.379
until we had
a chance to talk.

13:45.413 --> 13:47.348
Well, I appreciate
the discretion, Tom,

13:47.382 --> 13:50.251
because even a hint of this,
and we would be facing a panic.

13:50.285 --> 13:52.053
And with this vote --

13:52.087 --> 13:53.387
Arthur,
I'm talking about

13:53.422 --> 13:55.089
the possibility
of turning this war around.

13:55.123 --> 13:56.824
And I'm telling you, Tom,
not to say another word.

13:56.859 --> 13:58.793
Your friendship
means a lot to me, Tom,

13:58.828 --> 14:02.264
but I will <i>not</i>
<i>jeopardize this city --</i>

14:02.298 --> 14:03.932
not even for you.

14:07.937 --> 14:09.671
Jeanne.

14:09.705 --> 14:11.940
Got a minute?

14:11.974 --> 14:14.042
Well,
kind of ironic, huh?

14:16.445 --> 14:18.413
I remember when trying
to get you to help with dinner

14:18.447 --> 14:19.814
was like pulling teeth.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.284
Be right back.

14:22.318 --> 14:24.353
Okay, Jeanne.

14:24.387 --> 14:26.421
Dad, the way
you're limping --

14:26.456 --> 14:28.724
it's from that fight,
isn't it?

14:28.758 --> 14:30.392
Ah, it's nothing.

14:30.427 --> 14:33.363
You were hurt trying to help me.
I just left you there.

14:33.397 --> 14:37.233
You never left me.
I always had you <i>here.</i>

14:37.268 --> 14:39.969
Just the thought of seeing you
again, it kept me going.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.104
I'm so sorry, Dad.

14:41.139 --> 14:42.806
It's okay.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.875
Just promise me
we're gonna stay together.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.246
Jeanne,
I know it's hard,

14:49.280 --> 14:51.114
but I need you
to tell me

14:51.148 --> 14:54.417
what happened with Diego
and the others.

14:56.787 --> 15:02.291
Skitter patrol spotted us
a couple days after we left.

15:02.325 --> 15:06.161
They came in force one night,
and we had to scatter.

15:06.195 --> 15:08.964
By morning,
the Skitters moved on, but...

15:08.999 --> 15:12.034
Diego and the rest
never made the rendezvous.

15:14.004 --> 15:16.038
I waited
as long as I could,

15:16.073 --> 15:19.041
and then I rode here.

15:19.076 --> 15:21.844
I'm sorry.

15:21.879 --> 15:23.746
I know how much
he meant to you.

15:23.781 --> 15:28.017
Now I wish that I'd given him
more of a chance.

15:28.051 --> 15:31.988
Diego and the others
could still be out there --

15:32.022 --> 15:33.356
lost or wounded.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.391
I begged them
to send a patrol.

15:35.425 --> 15:37.894
Manchester
wouldn't even consider it.

15:37.928 --> 15:39.262
I can't let it go,
Dad.

15:40.330 --> 15:43.932
I have to say something
in tomorrow night's meeting.

15:43.966 --> 15:45.333
Then you say it.

15:45.368 --> 15:47.536
And I'll be there
for you.

15:47.570 --> 15:48.938
Okay.

15:48.972 --> 15:50.572
I promise.

15:52.809 --> 15:54.310
I have to get back.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.379
All right, well,
I-I'll see you later?

15:56.413 --> 15:57.947
Yeah.

16:11.194 --> 16:13.329
Anne.

16:13.363 --> 16:14.830
Hey.

16:14.865 --> 16:17.433
Hey.
You're here early.

16:17.467 --> 16:19.835
Yeah, I just wanted
to get started.

16:19.869 --> 16:21.937
Helps to stay busy,
you know?

16:21.971 --> 16:23.138
Mm-hmm.

16:23.173 --> 16:24.206
You want me
to show you around?

16:24.241 --> 16:25.207
I'd love it.

16:25.242 --> 16:26.408
Come on.

16:26.443 --> 16:29.378
Um...there's medicine
over here.

16:31.515 --> 16:34.084
Amoxicillin,
erythromycin...

16:34.118 --> 16:35.485
They're well-stocked.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.955
They know I was pre-med,
so I've been assigned

16:37.989 --> 16:40.224
to the surgical unit.

16:40.259 --> 16:42.226
A chance to learn and --

16:42.261 --> 16:43.861
Excuse me.

16:45.564 --> 16:47.832
Are you the new doctor
everyone's been talking about?

16:47.866 --> 16:50.968
I guess I am.

16:51.003 --> 16:52.236
Anne Glass.

16:52.271 --> 16:53.538
Thank God.

16:53.572 --> 16:55.406
If I have to wipe
one more snotty nose...

16:55.441 --> 16:57.508
Okay, over here is pediatrics.
We've got --

16:59.177 --> 17:01.879
I mean, <i>you've</i> got
two flus, a tonsillitis,

17:01.913 --> 17:04.848
and a killer case
of head lice.

17:04.883 --> 17:06.849
You're leaving?
Just like that?

17:06.885 --> 17:09.553
You're a pediatrician.
I'm a heart specialist.

17:09.587 --> 17:10.987
Do the math.

17:11.021 --> 17:12.155
Hold on.

17:13.156 --> 17:14.924
I'm the combat medic
from the 2nd Mass,

17:14.958 --> 17:16.992
who's gonna have you
walking bow-legged

17:17.027 --> 17:20.296
unless you talk me through
each patient's chart.

17:24.901 --> 17:28.037
All right.
Whatever you say.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.943
So much
for professional courtesy.

17:32.977 --> 17:35.011
Once they find out about
your experience in the field,

17:35.046 --> 17:36.946
they'll probably have you
running the place.

17:36.981 --> 17:38.048
I'm fine.

17:38.082 --> 17:41.184
Whatever I can do
to help.

17:49.260 --> 17:50.494
I'm glad
I found you.

17:50.528 --> 17:51.628
Hey.

17:51.662 --> 17:53.030
It's been
quite a first day.

17:53.064 --> 17:54.164
What's this?

17:54.199 --> 17:56.566
Bounty from
Manchester's garden.

17:56.601 --> 17:59.903
Enjoy it. I don't think
I'm gonna be getting any more.

17:59.937 --> 18:01.905
Skitter rebellion
didn't sit well?

18:01.940 --> 18:04.908
I'm surprised that I didn't
get thrown out of his quarters.

18:04.943 --> 18:07.444
Looks like they're skipping the
Brussels sprouts just for you.

18:07.479 --> 18:09.179
And everything else,
for that matter.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.581
Hello, Jeanne.

18:10.615 --> 18:12.315
Wouldn't expect
last night's spread.

18:12.350 --> 18:13.683
Manchester's executive menu

18:13.718 --> 18:15.485
as a special
"Welcome to Charleston" gift.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.588
Don't think everyone rates
their own private quarters.

18:18.623 --> 18:21.057
Most of us
are sleeping 10 to a cubicle.

18:21.092 --> 18:23.059
Well, we didn't ask
for special treatment.

18:23.094 --> 18:24.995
You didn't have to.

18:25.029 --> 18:26.530
I'm sorry.

18:27.699 --> 18:30.334
It's not you.
It's this place.

18:30.368 --> 18:32.269
Be careful.

18:32.303 --> 18:34.571
Say the wrong thing, and you're
pulling double shifts or worse.

18:37.709 --> 18:39.943
I know this sounds petty,

18:39.978 --> 18:41.678
but there's
something off here.

18:41.713 --> 18:43.413
You mean like
how they've assigned

18:43.448 --> 18:47.151
an experienced combat surgeon
to pediatrics?

18:47.185 --> 18:49.087
I'm not saying
it isn't important.

18:49.121 --> 18:52.156
With the 2nd Mass, I was doing
vital medicine, saving lives.

18:52.191 --> 18:54.526
Suddenly, I'm back
to passing out aspirin now?

18:54.560 --> 18:56.093
Taking temperatures?

18:56.128 --> 18:57.629
I tell you --
it <i>is</i> strange...

18:57.663 --> 19:01.199
how casual
everybody behaves.

19:01.234 --> 19:02.668
It's almost
as if they really believe

19:02.702 --> 19:04.270
the aliens
have disappeared.

19:04.304 --> 19:07.006
I used to ache
for that sense of complacency.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.474
Now it almost scares me.

19:08.508 --> 19:09.742
I agree.

19:20.133 --> 19:22.334
You're not gonna believe
their artillery.

19:22.368 --> 19:25.304
AT4s, GAU-17 minigun,
heavy mortars.

19:25.338 --> 19:28.307
We're talking
serious alien stir-fry.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.342
Yeah, assuming they ever
take it out of storage.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.678
Look, remember, we're just here
to get a lay of the land,

19:32.713 --> 19:34.814
grab whatever the hell we can
carry, and get the hell out of here.

19:34.848 --> 19:36.148
You!

19:36.183 --> 19:39.185
So-called Berserkers,
fall in.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.719
Oh, no.

19:45.191 --> 19:47.259
What the hell is this?

19:47.293 --> 19:48.727
Did I say to talk?

19:48.761 --> 19:51.363
I'm sorry.
Did I say "kiss my ass"?

19:51.397 --> 19:52.464
You kidding?

19:52.499 --> 19:54.233
You must be Pope,
right?

19:54.267 --> 19:58.303
I understand you think
that you're smarter, faster,

19:58.338 --> 20:01.106
and tougher than just about
any man in this outfit.

20:01.141 --> 20:02.241
You catch on quick.

20:02.275 --> 20:03.909
Tec, you just
gonna stand there

20:03.944 --> 20:05.444
in your new jammies,
sucking your thumb or what?

20:05.479 --> 20:08.814
Name's Gunnery Sergeant
Murphy, Pope.

20:08.849 --> 20:10.483
Now fall the hell in.

20:14.522 --> 20:17.390
I think you and I are gonna have
a lot of fun together.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.225
Grab some iron.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.928
Let's see if you Massachusetts
crybabies know how to shoot.

20:21.963 --> 20:23.397
Hmm?

20:27.903 --> 20:31.071
Detail, halt!

20:31.106 --> 20:32.773
Detail, hut one!

20:32.808 --> 20:35.877
All right.
Done and done.

20:35.911 --> 20:38.313
I'll go grab a sandwich
while you guys catch up.

20:38.347 --> 20:41.183
Hal, lock it up
and get over here.

20:43.886 --> 20:45.153
Captain.
You all right?

20:45.187 --> 20:48.923
Damn A.C.U.s
itch like hell.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.259
What are you doing?

20:52.294 --> 20:54.895
We're barely here,
and you're popping off.

20:54.930 --> 20:57.331
What are we doing,
Captain?

20:57.365 --> 20:59.366
We got target practice
and close-order drills

20:59.400 --> 21:01.168
while the things
are still out there.

21:01.202 --> 21:03.002
That's the point --
Porter tells me

21:03.037 --> 21:04.804
that most of these boys have
never fired a shot in combat.

21:04.839 --> 21:06.372
That supposed to make me
feel better?

21:06.407 --> 21:08.475
Hell no!

21:08.509 --> 21:10.176
But, chances are,

21:10.211 --> 21:13.179
you are gonna be leading
some of them into battle.

21:13.214 --> 21:15.481
They're gonna be
scared as hell.

21:15.516 --> 21:18.451
You got to teach them
to conquer that fear.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.186
The only way
you're gonna do that

21:20.221 --> 21:23.189
is if you have
their respect.

21:23.224 --> 21:25.124
I hear you.

21:25.159 --> 21:26.526
Good.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.228
Now you get back
to tearing down that weapon

21:28.262 --> 21:30.229
till you're seeing it
in your dreams, understood?

21:30.264 --> 21:32.098
Yes, sir.

21:37.972 --> 21:39.505
Can I see
your paperwork?

21:50.117 --> 21:51.451
Matt, what happened?

21:51.485 --> 21:53.853
I hate school.
I hate it here.

21:53.888 --> 21:55.555
I wish
we'd never come.

21:55.589 --> 21:57.557
I thought
you were enjoying class.

21:57.591 --> 21:59.459
There.
All fixed up.

21:59.493 --> 22:01.328
He'll be fine.

22:02.596 --> 22:05.832
Come on, Matt. Talk to me.
What happened?

22:05.866 --> 22:08.068
I was in class
when one of the bigger kids

22:08.102 --> 22:10.370
started talking trash
about us.

22:10.405 --> 22:13.373
I'm guessing
it was nothing good?

22:13.408 --> 22:15.909
He said
he thinks the 2nd Mass --

22:15.943 --> 22:17.544
we never fought
the aliens,

22:17.578 --> 22:20.113
that we're just cowards who
came here to steal from them.

22:20.147 --> 22:22.482
He said that you made a deal
with the aliens

22:22.516 --> 22:24.050
when they took you away...

22:26.353 --> 22:28.989
...so that
they'd leave us alone.

22:29.023 --> 22:30.324
Oh.

22:30.358 --> 22:31.558
Well...

22:33.361 --> 22:34.928
you know he's wrong.

22:34.963 --> 22:36.930
Then why'd the rest of them
act like he was right?

22:36.964 --> 22:37.998
I don't know.

22:38.032 --> 22:40.533
So, this boy
took a swing at you?

22:40.568 --> 22:43.002
Mm.

22:43.036 --> 22:45.304
Well...No.

22:45.339 --> 22:47.006
<i>I</i> hit <i>him.</i>

22:47.040 --> 22:50.209
I think I might have
broke his tooth.

22:50.243 --> 22:53.279
I heard the shouting.
Then I pulled Matt out of there.

22:53.313 --> 22:55.147
He's been suspended
for a week.

22:57.083 --> 23:00.285
Dad, I don't ever
want to go back.

23:00.319 --> 23:01.920
Well,
it's probably better

23:01.954 --> 23:04.956
if you stay close to home
for a while, anyway.

23:08.361 --> 23:11.129
We've got five minutes before
the sentries come. Hurry up.

23:11.164 --> 23:13.431
Sweet.

23:13.466 --> 23:17.035
Hold it right there.

23:17.069 --> 23:18.570
I swear
I didn't hear a thing.

23:18.604 --> 23:20.539
Put it back, Lyle.

23:23.342 --> 23:25.577
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

23:25.611 --> 23:27.479
2nd Mass was welcomed
by these people.

23:27.513 --> 23:29.915
I'm not gonna let
an ape like you ruin that.

23:29.949 --> 23:32.317
Close it up, back off,

23:32.351 --> 23:34.919
and we'll pretend
this never happened.

23:34.954 --> 23:36.187
Nobody move!

23:39.292 --> 23:41.627
Don't shoot.
I said, don't move.

23:42.562 --> 23:43.428
No!

23:44.230 --> 23:45.931
Lyle!

23:45.965 --> 23:47.199
Robo team, on me!

23:47.233 --> 23:48.500
You shot him!

23:48.535 --> 23:50.102
You're lucky
his aim was off.

23:50.136 --> 23:51.970
I would have put it
between his eyes.

23:52.005 --> 23:55.074
You shot him!
You son of a bitch!

23:55.108 --> 23:56.208
Put them in lockdown.

23:56.243 --> 23:57.343
Yes, sir.

23:57.377 --> 23:58.944
Take the bleeder
to medical.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.012
This isn't
what you think.

24:03.149 --> 24:06.485
Told you
we'd have some fun.

24:06.519 --> 24:08.654
I'm gonna wish you
into the cornfield.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.118
Arthur

24:15.504 --> 24:16.762
We need to talk.

24:16.763 --> 24:18.364
If it's about the incident last night,
that's Bressler's call.

24:18.398 --> 24:19.999
It's about the incident.

24:20.033 --> 24:21.734
A man got shot, and you've got
three people in lockup.

24:21.768 --> 24:23.169
It's a military matter,
Tom.

24:23.203 --> 24:25.137
Military defers to <i>you.</i>

24:25.172 --> 24:27.139
Damn it, Maggie was trying
to stop them.

24:27.173 --> 24:29.374
And the Berserkers --
they're out of their mind,

24:29.409 --> 24:32.044
but you're gonna want that kind
of crazy if there's an attack.

24:32.078 --> 24:33.311
What do you suggest?

24:33.346 --> 24:34.445
Let Maggie walk.

24:34.480 --> 24:35.813
And this Pope
and the rest?

24:35.847 --> 24:37.248
Punish them.
Put them on crap details.

24:37.282 --> 24:38.816
I don't really care.

24:38.850 --> 24:40.251
We don't have enough people
to lose four more.

24:40.285 --> 24:42.119
Look, Tom, I get it.
I really do.

24:42.153 --> 24:44.788
But you need to see this
from <i>my</i> perspective, okay?

24:44.823 --> 24:46.123
I'm listening.

24:46.157 --> 24:47.858
Bressler has been
pounding the war drum

24:47.892 --> 24:48.992
to take a more aggressive
posture toward the aliens.

24:49.027 --> 24:50.494
Okay.

24:50.528 --> 24:53.063
Built his army, and now
he wants to pull the trigger.

24:53.097 --> 24:55.198
But he's right about wanting
to get into the fight.

24:55.233 --> 24:57.000
It's the only way
we're gonna beat them.

24:57.035 --> 24:58.802
I understand that,
of course.

24:58.837 --> 25:01.005
I hope so, Arthur, because
as comfortable as this all is,

25:01.039 --> 25:03.207
nobody's really safe
until the aliens are gone.

25:03.241 --> 25:04.542
It's just not the time.

25:06.078 --> 25:07.879
It's taken months,
but we've created

25:07.913 --> 25:09.814
the first city-state
in the new America,

25:09.849 --> 25:11.116
and I want
to nurture it.

25:11.150 --> 25:13.084
I want to turn it
into something greater.

25:13.118 --> 25:15.287
But I can't do it
if I don't have the authority.

25:15.321 --> 25:18.056
I can't afford to look weak --
not now.

25:18.090 --> 25:20.926
And doing nothing --
how does <i>that</i> look?

25:26.032 --> 25:28.801
Look, just help me
get through this vote tonight,

25:28.835 --> 25:33.038
and I will look into clemency,
we'll discuss Bressler,

25:33.073 --> 25:34.940
and then together,

25:34.975 --> 25:38.077
we'll start to build
this new government.

25:42.516 --> 25:44.484
Hey.

25:44.518 --> 25:47.954
Mind if I get a minute
to talk with Maggie?

25:47.989 --> 25:49.055
Yeah.

25:49.090 --> 25:50.556
Thanks.

26:01.835 --> 26:03.836
My dad's
talking to Manchester.

26:03.870 --> 26:05.804
We're not
gonna let this lie.

26:05.839 --> 26:08.540
Well, since your pop's
calling in favors,

26:08.575 --> 26:10.275
maybe he can, uh,
put in a good word

26:10.310 --> 26:11.543
for the rest
of the rabble.

26:11.577 --> 26:13.311
Well, this is
because of you, Pope,

26:13.346 --> 26:15.480
so you're lucky you're not
in front of a firing squad.

26:15.515 --> 26:17.483
Yeah, well, at least
they'd be using those guns

26:17.517 --> 26:19.151
for something useful.

26:19.185 --> 26:21.053
I don't care
what Manchester says,

26:21.087 --> 26:22.921
I'm getting you
out of here.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.091
You do what you're thinking,
you're gonna get us all killed.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.059
I'm not asking
for any favors.

26:27.094 --> 26:28.461
Damn it, Maggie.

26:28.496 --> 26:30.296
Is this because of
what happened on the road?

26:30.331 --> 26:32.399
Because if it is,
I'm good with it, all right?

26:32.433 --> 26:33.967
Just like that?

26:34.001 --> 26:36.102
Just like that.
How else should it be?

26:36.136 --> 26:39.305
For God's sake, Hal, I told you
that I had a kid in prison.

26:39.340 --> 26:40.907
You should have
freaked out

26:40.941 --> 26:42.375
and told me I was
the worst person in the world.

26:42.409 --> 26:43.576
Is that what you wanted?

26:43.610 --> 26:45.144
What I expected
was the courtesy

26:45.179 --> 26:46.846
of an honest
emotional reaction.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.614
Instead, I got
"I'm gonna think about it"

26:48.649 --> 26:50.249
and teenage silences.

26:50.284 --> 26:51.884
Maggie --

26:51.918 --> 26:54.086
I can't deal with that,
all right? I won't.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.854
Maggie.

26:55.889 --> 26:57.990
I'm sorry.

26:58.024 --> 27:01.026
Look, you did your good deed.
Now just leave me alone.

27:06.299 --> 27:08.266
Go!

27:15.440 --> 27:17.641
So, as grateful as I am,

27:17.675 --> 27:21.244
I can't help thinking
about the world around us.

27:22.513 --> 27:25.081
I have friends
still out there --

27:25.116 --> 27:28.918
maybe lost or sick.

27:28.953 --> 27:30.921
And we're not doing anything
about it,

27:30.955 --> 27:34.024
except waiting, hiding...

27:34.058 --> 27:37.194
hoping the aliens will go away.

27:39.297 --> 27:43.568
I don't think that makes you
a bad man, Dr. Manchester.

27:43.602 --> 27:46.170
But I do think you're wrong.

27:49.575 --> 27:54.011
That's --
that's all I have to say.

28:03.255 --> 28:05.189
You did good.

28:05.224 --> 28:08.059
I would like to thank
all the speakers

28:08.093 --> 28:13.231
for their passion
and commitment.

28:13.265 --> 28:15.466
Before I begin,

28:15.500 --> 28:17.968
I would like to introduce
an old friend --

28:18.003 --> 28:20.604
my former student

28:20.638 --> 28:23.941
and the hero of the 2nd Mass,
Tom Mason.

28:23.975 --> 28:25.943
Tom.

28:39.458 --> 28:44.730
Thank you for welcoming
the 2nd Mass into your home.

28:44.764 --> 28:46.499
Yeah!

28:46.533 --> 28:48.501
And congratulations

28:48.535 --> 28:51.104
on taking back a city
the aliens left in ruins

28:51.138 --> 28:54.474
and turning it
into a community again.

28:56.643 --> 28:58.644
I wish I could end there.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.015
But the truth is,
I'm still finding my footing.

29:06.553 --> 29:08.588
All I've known for the last year

29:08.622 --> 29:12.292
has been the 2nd Mass
and the resistance.

29:13.727 --> 29:16.028
And so, as much as I admire
what you've done,

29:16.063 --> 29:18.164
I can't help but to agree
with Jeanne Weaver

29:18.198 --> 29:23.202
and wonder if somehow
our real mission has been lost.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.575
I want to read you something

29:29.609 --> 29:34.114
that a friend of mine wrote
about a different war.

29:37.318 --> 29:40.721
"There were some
who advocated accommodation,

29:40.755 --> 29:44.025
"who believed
the enemy would only be enraged

29:44.059 --> 29:47.528
"by outright rebellion.

29:47.563 --> 29:49.197
"But they were outnumbered

29:49.231 --> 29:52.434
"by those who understood
that freedom would only come

29:52.468 --> 29:55.403
once the enemy had been driven
from their land."

29:57.373 --> 30:00.409
That was written
by Arthur Manchester.

30:02.112 --> 30:04.347
About the American struggle
against the British

30:04.381 --> 30:07.117
during our revolution.

30:07.151 --> 30:10.387
But he might as well
have been writing about today.

30:10.421 --> 30:11.488
Right.

30:11.522 --> 30:12.523
Yeah!

30:12.557 --> 30:14.791
I've met our enemy.

30:14.826 --> 30:16.793
I've seen what it's done
to our children.

30:16.827 --> 30:20.664
I've looked in its eyes,
and I've heard it speak.

30:20.698 --> 30:24.201
And I am telling you that these
creatures will leave our world

30:24.235 --> 30:25.635
only when we force them to!

30:25.670 --> 30:27.437
That's right.
That's right.

30:27.471 --> 30:29.472
I <i>know</i>
<i>that I have to keep fighting.</i>

30:29.506 --> 30:33.075
This community
has to make its own call.

30:33.110 --> 30:35.778
But understand --
we can't hide from them anymore.

30:40.850 --> 30:44.219
General Bressler!
General Bressler!

30:44.254 --> 30:46.121
Sergeant? Sergeant!

30:46.155 --> 30:47.589
What is it?

30:47.623 --> 30:49.557
Sorry, sir. We have
a situation that couldn't wait.

30:49.591 --> 30:51.426
Our salvage unit found
a de-harnessed boy at the perimeter.

30:51.460 --> 30:52.827
They're
bringing him in now.

30:52.862 --> 30:55.230
De-harnessed boy?
Did he say what he wanted?

30:55.264 --> 30:57.766
Only that he had been
looking for Charleston

30:57.800 --> 31:00.236
and that he has a message
for Tom Mason.

31:06.295 --> 31:07.562
Ben?

31:09.198 --> 31:10.966
You know this boy?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.001
No.

31:15.272 --> 31:16.505
I'm Tom Mason.

31:16.540 --> 31:18.174
I was told to find you --

31:18.208 --> 31:20.243
that you were the only one
who would understand.

31:20.278 --> 31:22.646
Told by who? By Ben?
Have you seen my son?

31:22.680 --> 31:24.548
I'm sorry.
I don't know him.

31:24.582 --> 31:26.450
But there's
so many of us now.

31:26.484 --> 31:28.518
I'm to tell you there's been a
development with the Overlords,

31:28.553 --> 31:29.719
and there isn't
much time.

31:29.754 --> 31:31.521
Who sent you?

31:31.555 --> 31:34.024
The one with the red eye --
the leader of the rebellion.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.725
He's waiting nearby
so you can talk.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.594
I'll take you to him
when you're ready.

31:37.628 --> 31:39.029
I'm ready.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.699
Gentlemen, come, come.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.671
This is insane. They could be
right outside the door.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.541
If they wanted to attack this place,
it'd be on fire by now.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.176
Arthur, I know it sounds risky,
but we have to hear them out.

31:53.211 --> 31:54.611
Tom's right.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.346
This alliance is the only
tactical advantage we have.

31:56.381 --> 31:58.148
We lose it,
we're back to square one.

31:58.183 --> 32:00.217
We've been waiting for the right
time to launch an offensive.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.052
No. It's too dangerous.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.321
Especially since we don't know
what else has been kept from us.

32:04.355 --> 32:05.622
What do you mean?

32:05.657 --> 32:07.124
You should have told me

32:07.158 --> 32:08.458
your son was
a part of this revolution.

32:08.493 --> 32:10.193
That's how this one found us,
isn't it?

32:10.227 --> 32:12.095
Ben always knew
we were coming to Charleston.

32:12.129 --> 32:14.297
Well, God only knows
what else he's told them.

32:14.331 --> 32:16.299
General,
put the boy in lockup,

32:16.333 --> 32:18.034
reinforce
our defensive perimeter.

32:18.068 --> 32:19.602
We're gonna hunker down,
play dead,

32:19.636 --> 32:23.172
and hope the aliens
will give us a pass.

32:23.206 --> 32:24.407
Yes, sir.

32:26.477 --> 32:29.345
Let's go.
He's going to lockup.

32:29.379 --> 32:30.646
Yes, sir.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.648
Tom, stay.

32:37.353 --> 32:38.720
It's all right.

32:45.128 --> 32:47.462
I expected a challenge
from my enemies,

32:47.497 --> 32:49.197
but not from my friend.

32:49.232 --> 32:51.233
When did
Bressler get to you?

32:52.802 --> 32:54.603
You know
better than that.

32:54.638 --> 32:56.605
Then what
are you looking for?

32:56.640 --> 32:58.140
A position
in the new government?

32:58.175 --> 32:59.342
Because you had that --
no questions asked.

32:59.376 --> 33:00.810
Arthur,
did you hear that boy?

33:00.844 --> 33:02.812
This is not the time
to be arguing politics.

33:02.846 --> 33:04.347
We have to hear them out.

33:04.382 --> 33:05.593
No. Bressler's sees
an opening, he'll --

33:05.594 --> 33:06.317
Arthur --

33:06.342 --> 33:08.368
Tom, I offered you my hand.
You slapped it away.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.755
Now we both
have to live with it.

33:23.569 --> 33:26.505
Get your hands off me,
you stupid jarhead!

33:30.209 --> 33:31.409
What the hell is this?

33:33.246 --> 33:36.448
It's your first decent meal
since you were locked up.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.516
Please.

34:06.177 --> 34:08.444
Mmm.

34:10.447 --> 34:13.850
I wanted to ask you
about Tom Mason.

34:13.884 --> 34:17.554
I've been hearing
some peculiar rumors.

34:17.589 --> 34:20.591
Mason's been peculiar
since the day I met him.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.159
So what?

34:22.194 --> 34:24.629
I'm concerned about the safety
of our compound.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.465
And I know that you two
don't like one another.

34:28.900 --> 34:32.837
If you have anything on Mason
that could impact our security,

34:32.871 --> 34:35.572
I'll look into
letting you out.

34:40.612 --> 34:43.447
So, the deal is...

34:43.482 --> 34:48.418
I give up Mason,
Mason burns...

34:48.453 --> 34:49.754
And I walk free?

34:49.788 --> 34:52.456
I only want the truth.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.895
Truth is...

34:56.929 --> 35:01.466
Tom Mason is a...

35:01.501 --> 35:05.271
pompous,
semi-erudite history buff

35:05.305 --> 35:07.907
with delusions of grandeur.

35:07.941 --> 35:12.745
And if anybody is gonna
knock him off his pedestal...

35:12.780 --> 35:16.616
It's gonna be me...

35:16.650 --> 35:21.854
And not
some two-bit tin-pot dictator

35:21.888 --> 35:23.389
of Charleston, S.C.

35:23.423 --> 35:24.490
Salud.

35:24.524 --> 35:25.691
Take him out.

35:25.726 --> 35:26.759
Yes, sir.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.700
Hey.
Here to see Maggie.

35:34.734 --> 35:35.734
Yeah.

35:47.312 --> 35:48.846
Better make this fast.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.681
What the hell
are you doing?

35:50.715 --> 35:54.385
Aliens are planning
a new offensive.

35:54.419 --> 35:56.687
Rebel Skitters sent that de-harnessed
kid to guide us to a meeting,

35:56.721 --> 35:58.722
but Manchester
won't let us go.

35:58.757 --> 36:01.658
So I'm going anyway,
and I'd like you to come with.

36:01.693 --> 36:04.261
You sure
that's a good idea?

36:04.296 --> 36:05.930
Nothing's changed
between us.

36:05.964 --> 36:07.398
That's where you're wrong.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.034
Do you know why
I needed time to think

36:09.068 --> 36:11.002
after you told me
about your bad-girl past?

36:11.036 --> 36:12.270
Tell me.

36:12.304 --> 36:13.838
'Cause
it didn't make sense.

36:13.873 --> 36:16.541
I don't know that Maggie.
I've never met her before.

36:17.776 --> 36:19.344
Only Maggie I know

36:19.378 --> 36:21.513
is the one standing right here
in front of me --

36:21.547 --> 36:23.582
the one who saved my butt
more times than I can count,

36:23.616 --> 36:25.684
and put her own life on the line
for the 2nd Mass

36:25.718 --> 36:27.319
over and over again.

36:28.721 --> 36:31.957
All right, the war
wiped the slate clean.

36:31.991 --> 36:34.760
I'm no longer
Hal the high-school jock,

36:34.794 --> 36:36.695
and you're not
Maggie the junkie thief.

36:36.730 --> 36:38.464
That might be
the only good thing

36:38.498 --> 36:40.065
that came
from this whole mess --

36:40.100 --> 36:42.501
a chance to start over,

36:42.535 --> 36:45.003
to become better people
than we were before.

36:45.038 --> 36:48.507
Nice speech.

36:48.541 --> 36:49.908
You been practicing?

36:49.943 --> 36:51.310
A little.

36:52.545 --> 36:54.447
But right now,
me, dad, and the rest

36:54.481 --> 36:56.515
are heading into the field.

36:56.550 --> 36:59.752
I'd feel a hell of a lot better
knowing you had my back.

37:01.388 --> 37:02.455
I'm in.

37:08.628 --> 37:11.097
Hey! What about me?!

37:14.169 --> 37:15.136
We good?

37:15.170 --> 37:16.304
Clear. Come on up.

37:18.374 --> 37:19.607
Let's go!

37:22.177 --> 37:24.378
I managed to get you this stuff
without too much fuss.

37:24.413 --> 37:26.347
You should be clear
all the way into the city.

37:26.381 --> 37:28.015
The bikes are parked
right outside.

37:28.050 --> 37:30.050
You're taking a hell of a chance
to help us, Jim.

37:30.085 --> 37:32.419
I take a chance every time
I drink coffee in this place.

37:32.454 --> 37:34.555
I just hope you have it right
about the Skitters.

37:34.589 --> 37:38.258
Drop your weapons
and step back!

37:52.105 --> 37:53.272
Stand down.

37:55.609 --> 37:56.676
Hal.

37:58.346 --> 38:01.481
You're all under arrest.

38:01.516 --> 38:03.584
Manchester's orders.

38:03.618 --> 38:06.320
He's declared
a state of emergency.

38:06.355 --> 38:08.456
All suspected dissidents
are being detained.

38:08.490 --> 38:11.193
You son of a bitch. Are you
ever gonna grow a backbone?

38:11.227 --> 38:13.562
Colonel, that's enough!

38:13.596 --> 38:15.230
At ease.

38:15.264 --> 38:17.432
General, I saw how you were
with Manchester.

38:17.467 --> 38:19.501
You know
this is the right move.

38:21.104 --> 38:22.705
I know how Manchester
sees it, too.

38:22.739 --> 38:25.607
Seems to me you ought to start
thinking about these people

38:25.642 --> 38:28.243
instead of your position,
<i>General.</i>

38:31.647 --> 38:33.481
What the hell
do you want from me?

38:33.516 --> 38:35.584
Talk to Manchester --
convince him we're right.

38:40.990 --> 38:43.125
Cuff them
and take them inside.

38:43.159 --> 38:44.393
Yes, sir!

38:46.997 --> 38:48.664
Sergeant Murphy!

38:51.001 --> 38:52.701
I'm sorry, sir.

38:52.736 --> 38:55.004
I respectfully refuse.

38:57.707 --> 38:59.141
Take him, too.

39:00.143 --> 39:01.109
General.

39:01.144 --> 39:04.112
Come on. Let's go.

39:06.015 --> 39:08.216
Move! Move!

39:08.250 --> 39:10.451
<i>All members of the 2nd Mass</i>

39:10.486 --> 39:12.420
<i>are to report to</i>
<i>the commons area immediately.</i>

39:12.454 --> 39:14.121
<i>All members of the 2nd Mass</i>

39:14.156 --> 39:16.423
<i>are to report to</i>
<i>the commons area immediately.</i>

39:16.458 --> 39:18.592
Get down and shut up!
Get down on the ground!

39:18.627 --> 39:21.429
Damn it,
I want this area cleared!

39:22.731 --> 39:24.131
Take them.

39:26.501 --> 39:28.135
What do you think
you're doing?!

39:28.170 --> 39:29.403
This is crazy! These people
haven't hurt anyone!

39:29.438 --> 39:30.604
Not yet.

39:30.639 --> 39:32.239
But some of them
must have known

39:32.274 --> 39:34.141
that Tom would try to reach out
to his rebel Skitters.

39:34.176 --> 39:35.276
If you hurt them --

39:35.310 --> 39:36.644
They were stopped,
thank God.

39:36.678 --> 39:39.146
But I can't risk
someone else from the 2nd Mass

39:39.180 --> 39:40.347
making the same mistake.

39:40.382 --> 39:42.082
So you're locking us up?

39:42.116 --> 39:43.750
Until you prove
you can be trusted, yes.

39:43.785 --> 39:45.786
And who makes
that decision? You?

39:47.221 --> 39:49.255
Make sure
you get them all.

39:49.290 --> 39:52.492
Is this really the kind of democracy
you were hoping to create?

39:52.526 --> 39:53.493
Down!

39:57.130 --> 39:59.498
Arthur, they told us
you separated the 2nd Mass

39:59.532 --> 40:01.300
from the rest
of the compound.

40:01.334 --> 40:03.302
You should have told me
what they did to you, Tom --

40:03.336 --> 40:05.804
about the implant
that they put in your eye.

40:05.839 --> 40:08.574
And the infection
that almost killed you, Captain.

40:08.609 --> 40:10.810
For all I know, you've been
taking orders from the aliens

40:10.844 --> 40:12.244
ever since you arrived.

40:12.279 --> 40:14.080
Who told you this?
Pope?

40:14.114 --> 40:15.648
Your friends
in the 2nd Mass.

40:15.682 --> 40:18.284
Once they understood
the gravity of the situation,

40:18.318 --> 40:19.786
several of them spoke up.

40:19.820 --> 40:22.088
Once you put them in custody
and threatened their families.

40:22.122 --> 40:24.390
Arthur, we have a chance
to really hurt the enemy.

40:24.425 --> 40:25.691
Put them
with the others.

40:28.362 --> 40:30.063
And then what?

40:30.097 --> 40:32.265
We organize a civilian trial
immediately.

40:32.300 --> 40:33.467
The charge is treason.

40:33.501 --> 40:35.402
And then we deal
with their sympathizers.

40:35.436 --> 40:39.339
You do that, you'll have
a <i>real</i> war on your hands.

40:39.373 --> 40:43.510
General Bressler,
I gave you an order.

40:48.284 --> 40:49.818
<i>If you have seen</i>
<i>any member of the 2nd Mass,</i>

40:49.852 --> 40:51.593
<i>please report to headquarters</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

40:51.594 --> 40:52.462
What are they
gonna do to us?

40:52.463 --> 40:54.719
<i>If you have seen</i>
<i>any members of the 2nd Mass,</i>

40:54.744 --> 40:56.744
<i>I don't know, Matt.</i>

40:56.792 --> 40:58.827
<i>Please report to military</i>
<i>headquarters immediately.</i>

40:58.861 --> 41:01.630
We were safer on our own,
weren't we?

41:09.839 --> 41:13.408
Open the cells.
Let them out -- all of them.

41:13.442 --> 41:15.376
Take your hands off me.

41:15.411 --> 41:18.146
Dad, what's going on?

41:18.181 --> 41:20.315
I built this compound.
These are my people.

41:22.752 --> 41:25.353
The civilian
government's been suspended.

41:25.387 --> 41:27.856
Charleston is
now under martial law.

41:27.890 --> 41:29.858
Arthur, you got to believe
I didn't want this.

41:29.892 --> 41:31.426
Well, you got it.

41:31.460 --> 41:34.162
Your damned alliance
is gonna kill us all.

41:34.196 --> 41:36.164
You want to make that rendezvous
with your rebel Skitters,

41:36.198 --> 41:38.433
I suggest you suck it up --
and fast.

41:38.468 --> 41:39.802
Nice work, boys.

41:39.836 --> 41:41.537
Looks like
you dropped us all

41:41.571 --> 41:44.574
into the middle
of a good old-fashioned coup.
