00:21.489 --> 00:23.057
TIFFANY THINKS
ONE OF YOUR ALTERS

00:23.091 --> 00:24.492
BROKE INTO HER PLACE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.160
TARA MADE A NEW FRIEND.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.196
TIFFANY WAS A THREAT
TO THE SYSTEM.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.731
IT'S JUST ONE OF YOUR ALTERS
SHOWING A SIDE WE'VE NEVER SEEN.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.433

MY MONEY'S ON T.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.268

00:40.274 --> 00:41.642
YOU SHOULD GO GET HER.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.577
DID YOU FIND HER?
YES, I HAVE.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.079
AND SHE'S NOT EVEN
IN ANY TROUBLE.

00:45.113 --> 00:46.480
WHAT HAPPENED

00:46.514 --> 00:47.748

00:47.781 --> 00:48.749
THEY'RE STAYING OVER.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.618
I WANT TO HAVE A PARTY.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.786

00:52.820 --> 00:56.090
OH, MY GOD.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.435

01:24.152 --> 01:27.655

01:32.326 --> 01:34.395

THAT'S WHERE IT ALL WENT DOWN.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.505
TWO CLICKS OFF
THE MEKONG RIVER.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.473
WE WERE HUNKERED DOWN

02:19.507 --> 02:22.576
NEVER SAW THOSE GOOK FUCKS

02:28.549 --> 02:32.886
FOR MY SINS...

02:46.367 --> 02:49.670
THEY ALL SAID I WAS LUCKY.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.547
WE WERE AT THE CHIEFS GAME,
FIREWORKS WENT OFF.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.916
YOU WENT TO THE BATHROOM

03:35.949 --> 03:39.653
AH, JESUS!

07:16.537 --> 07:18.806
WELL, BEV AND I WERE TALKING.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.041
YOU KNOW, IF YOU TWO EVER WANT
TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK,

07:21.074 --> 07:22.776
YOU COULD ALWAYS SEND THE KIDS
TO STAY WITH US.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.177
LIKE A WEEKEND?

07:24.211 --> 07:26.780

07:26.814 --> 07:30.117
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

07:50.303 --> 07:52.906
I TOLD HIM TEN TIMES TO

07:52.940 --> 07:54.942
UH, APPARENTLY
THEY'RE ILLEGAL.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.611
YOU KNOW, THE COPS DIDN'T THINK
THEY WERE TOO FUNNY.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.813
HONESTLY, I DON'T GET
THE LOGIC MYSELF.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.248
DOES THE--
DOES THE TRUCK HAVE A DICK?

08:01.281 --> 08:03.684
OR IS THE TRUCK THE DICK?

08:03.717 --> 08:06.219
IF THE TRUCK IS THE DICK, THEN
THE BALLS ARE WAY TOO SMALL.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.188

08:25.205 --> 08:28.876
I AM HAVING
A BAD FUCKIN' DAY.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.211
TARA'S PARENTS WANT

08:31.244 --> 08:32.580
DOES TARA KNOW
ABOUT THIS?

08:32.613 --> 08:33.981
NO WAY.
YOU KIDDING?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.849
IT'D PUT HER OVER

08:35.883 --> 08:38.586
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
IT'S NOT A BAD THING.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.253
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

08:40.287 --> 08:41.689

08:48.128 --> 08:51.064
HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO FIND AUNT
CHARMAINE A BIRTHDAY PRESENT?

08:51.098 --> 08:53.000
I COULDN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.569
A COFFEE CARD, A BOOK,
SOME BUBBLE BATH...

08:55.603 --> 08:57.137
IF IT COMES FROM YOU,
SHE'S GONNA LOVE IT.

08:57.170 --> 09:00.608
NO, SHE WON'T.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.275
OKAY, THIS IS CRAZY.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.877
WHAT IS THE DEAL

09:03.911 --> 09:05.212
I DON'T KNOW, ASK HER.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.647
SHE JUST ALWAYS HATES ME.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.315

09:08.348 --> 09:10.784
HEY.

WHERE'S YOUR DAD?

09:12.319 --> 09:14.321
OH, HE FELL ASLEEP ON THE COUCH
WATCHING THE GAME.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.223
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.625
I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.159
YOU WANT TO TAKE A XANAX,
TAKE A XANAX.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.861
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

09:20.894 --> 09:22.229
MY FLAG TOO FREAKY
FOR YOU?

09:22.262 --> 09:24.131
NO, I JUST SPENT AN HOUR
WITH YOUR FATHER,

09:24.164 --> 09:28.736
AND I ALMOST BECAME BUCK
JUST TO KICK HIS ASS.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.170
THIS ISN'T USUALLY
MY STYLE,

09:30.203 --> 09:31.939
BUT I'M HEADIN' DOWN
TO XANAX TOWN.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.106
YOU WANNA COME?

09:37.210 --> 09:40.080
I'M GONNA SAY NOPE
TO DOPE.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.783
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE MADE A DECISION.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.251
NO PILLS.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.853
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT
ANYTHING TO HAPPEN,

09:45.886 --> 09:47.955
BUT IF IT DOES, IT DOES.
I'M OKAY WITH IT.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.662
(Tara)
IT'S NOT MY IDEA.
CHARMAINE WANTS TO DO IT.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.929
WELL, I DON'T REMEMBER
HOW TO PLAY.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.064
IT'S THE SAME GAME
WE ALWAYS PLAY.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.966
SHE LIKES IT.
SHE'S GOOD AT IT.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.701
THAT'S BECAUSE
WE LET HER WIN.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.102
IT IS TRUE.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.370
YOU KNOW, I ONCE HAD LUNCH
WITH GEORGE BRETT.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.772
[door shuts]

10:04.805 --> 10:07.174
* LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED

10:07.207 --> 10:08.208
WHOO!

10:08.241 --> 10:09.943
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU,
HONEY.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.112
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL!

10:12.145 --> 10:13.113
THANKS.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.414
YOU LOOK THIN.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.716
THANK YOU, DADDY.

10:15.749 --> 10:16.817
HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
AUNT CHARMAINE.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.218
WHERE'S, UH, KATE?

10:18.251 --> 10:19.352
(Max)
GOOD QUESTION. KATE!

10:19.386 --> 10:20.721
YOU WANT ME TO OPEN THIS?

10:20.754 --> 10:22.222
WE'RE NOT EATING
FOR AN HOUR.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.024
(Bev)
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS
TO YOU SISTER?

10:24.057 --> 10:25.058
DO WHAT?

10:25.092 --> 10:28.261
MAKE HER WORK SO HARD.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.663
(Tara)
MOM...

10:29.697 --> 10:30.898
WE COULD HAVE GONE
TO PIERPONTS.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.365
YEAH, YOU COULD HAVE HAD
A STEAK.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.366
SHOULD I JUST LEAVE?

10:33.400 --> 10:34.968
DAD, JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.104
I'M JUST WORRIED
ABOUT HER.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.405
SHE LOOKS THIN.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.840
WELL, YOU KNOW,
SHE NEVER EATS.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.241
AND WHEN SHE EATS,
SHE EATS ALONE.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.210
WOW. WINE?

10:43.243 --> 10:44.778
WITH A STRAW.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.113
HEY, WE'RE GONNA
PLAY THAT GAME

10:46.146 --> 10:47.881
YOU'RE SO GOOD AT.

10:47.915 --> 10:50.050
[clears throat]

10:50.083 --> 10:51.719
HAS IT BEEN LIKE THIS
ALL DAY?

10:51.752 --> 10:53.220
ALL DAY.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.190
OH, HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
AUNT CHARMAINE.

10:57.224 --> 11:00.193
SORRY I CAN'T KICK IT UP,
BUT I GOTTA HIT IT.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.394
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

11:01.428 --> 11:03.396
IN MY UNIFORM?
I'M OFF TO IRAQ.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.732
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
WORKING.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.400
WELL, I JUST GOT
CALLED IN.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.903
THIS CHICK EMILY,
HER DAD JUST TOOK OFF,

11:09.937 --> 11:13.140
SO HER MOM SLIT HER WRISTS,
LIKE A DUMBASS.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.008
LEFT TO RIGHT,
NOT UP AND DOWN.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.409
IT WAS ON THE NEWS.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.879
FINE. LET HER GO.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.881
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
YELLING ABOUT?

11:20.914 --> 11:22.415
WELL, ALL OF A SUDDEN KATE SAYS
SHE HAS TO GO INTO WORK.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.351
I--THIS IS NOT MY CHOICE.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.919
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY,

11:25.953 --> 11:27.187
AND I'M TRYING TO BE
A TEAM PLAYER HERE.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.856
HEY, YOUR MOM
WORKED HER ASS OFF.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.290
GO IN THAT ROOM, PUT A SMILE
ON YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.425
DAD...PLEEEEASE!

11:32.459 --> 11:34.294
MOVE YOUR ASS.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.663
[Kate sighs dramatically]
(Max)
NO EYE ROLLING.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.269
OH, FUCK.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.039
ALL RIGHT, SO
I LOOK LIKE SHIT.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.941
I'VE GOT NO MAKEUP ON,

11:47.975 --> 11:48.976
AND I GET OUT
OF THE CAR

11:49.009 --> 11:50.477
TO RIP THIS GUY A NEW ONE.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.012
AND GUESS WHO IT IS.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.247
MY EX-BOYFRIEND,
CHRIS HUNTER.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.983
YOU REMEMBER HIM?
OH, YEAH.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.184
(Frank)
NO, I DON'T REMEMBER HIM.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.451
(Bev)
YEAH, I THINK I DO.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.053
YEAH.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.188
SO, MARSHALL...

12:01.221 --> 12:02.756
MOM.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.257
WHAT?

12:04.291 --> 12:05.425
CHARMAINE'S TELLING A STORY.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.160
OH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.395
OH, I THOUGHT
SHE WAS DONE.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.462
OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.364
NO, GO AHEAD.
FINISH YOUR STORY.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.901
WHAT HAPPENS?
WHAT HAPPENS?

12:13.934 --> 12:16.336
[chuckles]
I SAID I WAS DONE.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.405
THAT'S ALL.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.473
SO, MARSHALL...

12:20.507 --> 12:22.810
YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND?

12:22.843 --> 12:24.311
(Kate)
OH, YEAH, SHE'S REALLY HOT.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.280
MOOSH, TELL HER ABOUT
YOUR HOT GIRLFRIEND.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.082
KATE, KNOCK IT OFF.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.350
YEAH, I BET SHE'S
A REAL LOOKER, HUH?

12:30.383 --> 12:32.319
YEAH, GRANDPA.
SHE'S A REAL LOOKER.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.221
YOU KNOW, SHE'S GOT
A GREAT SET OF WALKING STICKS.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.956
I MET HER WHEN SHE ENTERED
MY PRIVATE EYE OFFICE.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.024
[laughter]

12:37.057 --> 12:38.258
GRANDPA, YOU SHOULD SEE HER.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.793
SHE'S GOT THESE BIG
BLUE EYES

12:39.827 --> 12:41.361
AND NINE UNCUT INCHES.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.529
(Max)
HEY, TIME FOR YOU
TO GO TO WORK.

12:42.562 --> 12:43.831
WHAT--I THOUGHT
THIS WAS WHAT

12:43.864 --> 12:45.132
YOU WANTED ME TO DO.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.967
NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE. GO.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.368
(Kate)
I'M JUST STARTING
TO HAVE FUN.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.970
YEAH, THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE LEAVING.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.872
BYE, HONEY.
(Kate)
BYE, GRANDMA.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.841
(Bev)
SO, MARSHALL,
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS

12:53.874 --> 12:55.943
WHAT OPENED UP IN OUR HOUSE
IN THE MALL.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.477
THIS LITTLE BOOK STORE

12:57.510 --> 12:59.546
WITH THE MOST ADORABLE
COFFEE SHOP.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.348
AND WHEN I SAW IT
I SAID TO MYSELF,
[knock on door]

13:01.381 --> 13:02.983
MARSHALL IS JUST
GONNA LOVE THIS.
HEY.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.818
I THOUGHT I SMELLED A PARTY
IN HERE.

13:04.852 --> 13:05.819
HEY, GUYS.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.287

OH, MY GOD.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.260
HEY, ALL RIGHT.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.427

13:14.461 --> 13:15.428
I JUST DROPPED BY

13:22.903 --> 13:24.337
(Frank)
YEAH, THEY HAVEN'T SEEN
THE NEW POOL.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.073
(Bev)
YOU SHOULD MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.208
HONEY, I HEARD A LITTLE DING.
I THINK I SMELL SMOKE.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.414
CHARMAINE.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.450
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, NEIL.

[imitating Neil]
I JUST CAME BY

14:21.328 --> 14:23.230
CHARMAINE, I PROMISE.
WHY WOULD I--

14:23.263 --> 14:25.032

A YEAR AGO

14:29.336 --> 14:32.172

15:11.511 --> 15:12.712
I WAS JUST TELLING
MARSHALL HERE,

15:12.745 --> 15:14.447
SINCE HE'S INTO
THEATRICS,

15:14.481 --> 15:16.016
THAT HE COULD GET
A WALK-ON PART

15:16.049 --> 15:17.450
AT THE MOSELY STREET
MELODRAMA.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.651
YOU KNOW,
THEY HAVE A BUFFET.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.153
THE AUDIENCE YELLS
AT THE ACTORS.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.554
WOW, THAT SOUNDS GREAT,

15:21.588 --> 15:23.290
WHEN DO I GET TO SEE

15:23.323 --> 15:25.292
WELL, LET'S GO.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.293
SEE YOU LATER,
GRANDPA.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.428
YEAH.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.563
COME ON IN.
THIS IS THE COMMAND CENTER.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.699
THE CAPTAIN'S CHAIR.

15:32.732 --> 15:35.035
AND EVERY CAPTAIN NEEDS
A CAPTAIN'S HAT.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.971
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
ABOUT THE RV, FRANK.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.572
THIS STUFF WITH MY KIDS,
I WANT IT TO STOP.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.575
COME ON, MAX, WE'RE
JUST TRYING TO HELP.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.045
YEAH, LAST TIME
YOU TRIED TO HELP,

15:45.078 --> 15:47.180
TARA DIDN'T SPEAK TO YOU
FOR TWO YEARS.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.016
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S JUST DROP IT,

15:49.049 --> 15:50.717
GO INSIDE,
HAVE A NICE DINNER,

15:50.750 --> 15:53.720
EAT SOME CAKE AND GET
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, OKAY?

15:53.753 --> 15:55.722
YEAH, I'LL SLEEP WHEN I KNOW
THE KIDS ARE SAFE.

15:55.755 --> 15:58.291
MY KIDS ARE SAFE.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.726
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
SPENT MORE TIME

15:59.759 --> 16:01.261
LOOKING AFTER YOURS.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.280
YOU KNOW IT'S AGAINST
COMPANY POLICY

16:20.313 --> 16:24.317
TO WEAR YOUR BARNABEEZ UNIFORM
WHEN YOU'RE OFF DUTY.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.418
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

16:25.452 --> 16:29.189
YOU'RE GONNA GET US BOTH FIRED.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.658
MY PARENTS ARE DRIVING ME
SHITHOUSE.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.693
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.363
WELL, YOU'RE HERE NOW.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL COME IN.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.605
THIS IS MY ROOMMATE KURT.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.241
HE RUNS THE HOULIHAN'S
IN BELTON.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.311
RIGHT NOW I'M JUST A GUY
WATCHING BATTLESTAR.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.512
[chuckles]

16:52.545 --> 16:55.515
THIS IS KATE.
SHE WORKS FOR ME.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.150
WE'LL BE IN MY ROOM.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.318
DO YOU WANT A BEER
OR SOMETHING?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.120
SURE.

17:00.153 --> 17:04.257
I DON'T HAVE ANY.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.659
COOL.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.261
COOL.

17:08.295 --> 17:11.030
[Battlestar Galactica droning]

17:12.699 --> 17:14.667
THAT WAS THE SAME SUMMER
YOU LET THAT CREEPY GIRL

17:14.701 --> 17:16.803
(Tara and Charmaine)
CUT MY HAIR!

17:16.836 --> 17:19.272
