WEBVTT

00:19.100 --> 00:20.090
Captain.

00:24.810 --> 00:26.801
This is who we are!

00:27.190 --> 00:29.272
This is what we Lynx do!

00:29.400 --> 00:30.811
We all get together

00:30.940 --> 00:35.195
and celebrate
this beautiful bitch called life!

00:37.160 --> 00:38.696
And that's why we all thought

00:38.830 --> 00:42.368
this was the best way
to honor our great friend

00:42.500 --> 00:44.161
and Sovereign Protector,

00:44.290 --> 00:46.031
Larry Loomis.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.491
Larry had a great ride,

00:49.630 --> 00:52.463
and he would be thrilled
to see all of you here.

00:53.090 --> 00:56.424
I also want to thank
the Signal Hill Mud Men

00:56.550 --> 00:58.006
for agreeing, on short notice,

00:58.140 --> 01:00.882
to participate
in @ non-league scrimmage

01:01.020 --> 01:03.671
honoring
one of their greatest rivals.

01:04.390 --> 01:06.973
Larry loved to kick your ass.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.101
He's right!

01:08.860 --> 01:11.067
OK, let's get a buzz on...

01:12.030 --> 01:13.987
and play ball!

01:17.740 --> 01:18.559
Ernie.

01:19.490 --> 01:22.369
The guy's crowding the plate.
Give him a little chin music.

01:22.910 --> 01:24.492
You want me to brushback Hector?

01:29.960 --> 01:30.950
I'm sorry.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.331
I just thought it might be nice
to win this game.

01:33.460 --> 01:34.871
You know, for Larry.

01:35.630 --> 01:37.962
Here he comes, the Messenger!

01:38.090 --> 01:39.637
Wait for your pitch, Serpent Boy.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.250
True Lodge. True Lodge.

01:42.890 --> 01:45.769
Hey, why did you have to tell them
everything, man? God.

01:46.060 --> 01:48.188
Yeah, get them, Connie! You got this!

01:48.310 --> 01:49.357
Let's go!

01:49.480 --> 01:51.517
-Hustle, baby! Hustle!
-Go, go, go!

01:53.230 --> 01:54.812
Slide! Slide!

01:57.400 --> 01:58.231
Yeah!

01:58.360 --> 02:01.022
-Yeah, baby!
-All right, baby! High five!

02:01.410 --> 02:04.323
So... Dud really got bit by a snake?

02:04.790 --> 02:06.110
He's lucky to be alive.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.366
I have him on a new spagyric regimen.

02:10.539 --> 02:12.247
All circles vanish.

02:13.420 --> 02:14.546
What?

05:05.680 --> 05:06.966
Got you a number three.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.098
So, there's lodges
in all of these places?

05:10.220 --> 05:11.426
That's incred...

05:11.560 --> 05:13.801
Prague. You've got Jakarta.

05:13.930 --> 05:15.307
Gainesville, Florida.

05:17.190 --> 05:18.180
All right, so...

05:18.810 --> 05:19.811
Grand Tour.

05:19.940 --> 05:23.570
Finish in London, and you pick up
your Sovereign Protector robes.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.318
Yeah. I don't want to keep you.
Thanks for dinner.

05:26.450 --> 05:28.066
I figured you'd want some company.

05:29.490 --> 05:31.117
How's Connie? Have you seen her?

05:31.240 --> 05:33.618
-No. And stop asking me about her.
-OK.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.457
You know, that's what I'm doing here.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.200
You know...

05:37.750 --> 05:40.993
Larry's gone, and you and Connie...

05:42.210 --> 05:45.043
Look, all I'm saying is it's my duty
as your squire

05:45.170 --> 05:47.298
to... make sure you're all right.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.137
Yeah? Your "duty as a squire."

05:50.510 --> 05:51.500
I just...

05:52.560 --> 05:55.131
I remember after my dad...

05:56.850 --> 05:57.840
and...

05:59.100 --> 06:01.649
and it was just,
I don't know, lonely.

06:04.490 --> 06:05.685
I appreciate that.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.947
But listen, I'm good.

06:08.780 --> 06:09.770
Larry...

06:11.160 --> 06:12.446
It's not a tragedy.

06:12.990 --> 06:15.038
Dude lived a full life, OK?

06:15.580 --> 06:16.615
It is what it is.

06:18.330 --> 06:20.628
And I've been through worse.

06:25.710 --> 06:26.962
You know, actually...

06:27.470 --> 06:30.087
later tonight
I've got my graveyard shift,

06:30.220 --> 06:34.430
so I was wondering if afterwards
I could maybe crash here for a day.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.925
Maybe two, tops, you know?

06:36.060 --> 06:38.722
So that's why you came around -
you need something.

06:38.850 --> 06:40.807
No! No, no. It's not that.

06:40.940 --> 06:43.477
It's just, you know,
I can't stay with Liz,

06:43.610 --> 06:46.147
and there's a possum infestation
in the trailer,

06:46.280 --> 06:48.396
and Avery's
in the Sentinel Suite with Blaise.

06:48.530 --> 06:49.656
Sleep in the library.

06:49.780 --> 06:50.986
The mummy cot?

06:54.120 --> 06:55.235
Key's under the mat.

06:55.370 --> 06:57.077
Oh, my God. Thank you.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.951
Hey, you know, I was thinking...

07:01.790 --> 07:04.839
maybe we should try to find
El Confidente.

07:05.550 --> 07:06.540
You know?

07:07.550 --> 07:09.120
Tell him about Larry, see what's up.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.880
Don't you want to know?

07:14.350 --> 07:16.842
You know... just to be sure?

07:21.980 --> 07:24.358
That's too short.
Looking to turn two.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.936
Not in time. At first...

07:27.730 --> 07:28.731
Hey, Burt.

07:34.450 --> 07:36.361
Paying off your car title loan?

07:37.410 --> 07:38.400
Nope.

07:39.870 --> 07:41.668
That's not enough for the watch.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.417
Well, I want that TV...

07:46.960 --> 07:48.200
because it's Ernie's.

07:50.880 --> 07:51.870
Nine hundred.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.590
What?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.846
That's highway robbery!

08:00.520 --> 08:02.056
OK, fine, let's negotiate.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.260
I can give you half,

08:03.400 --> 08:05.641
or... half of half.

08:05.770 --> 08:06.760
No.

08:09.610 --> 08:12.648
Listen, Ernie can't watch
the ballgame on a 14-inch-screen TV.

08:12.780 --> 08:14.817
It's a travesty, OK?
He deserves better.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.077
I can't give an advance
on your paycheck.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.534
Yeah, I get it. You know, the
bureaucratic bureaucracy of things.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.786
But how about another assignment,
you know?

08:25.920 --> 08:26.955
Love graveyard,

08:27.090 --> 08:30.048
but I was thinking maybe I could get
something in the daytime, too.

08:30.170 --> 08:31.501
Diversify my portfolio.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.870
OK.

08:34.010 --> 08:36.798
There's a crappy temp assignment
I've had trouble filling,

08:36.929 --> 08:40.217
but, actually, something way better
came in this morning.

08:41.929 --> 08:44.227
You're not the first person
I thought of,

08:44.350 --> 08:48.139
but Gloria at Orbis gave you
a strong recommendation, so...

08:49.230 --> 08:52.564
Clerical at a small software company.
Three-month temp-to-hire.

08:52.690 --> 08:54.988
They want to fill the position,
so, for you,

08:55.110 --> 08:56.908
this could be a career opportunity.

08:57.030 --> 08:58.486
Oh, no, I don't need a career.

08:58.620 --> 09:01.749
I just need the cash, so...
What was the other thing?

09:04.290 --> 09:05.701
Answering phones.

09:05.830 --> 09:09.130
Help a local company we contract with
with their satellite office.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.042
Pay's OK, the commute's brutal.

09:11.340 --> 09:12.330
I'll take it.

10:24.370 --> 10:25.440
New record!

10:25.580 --> 10:27.150
That's a new record!

10:31.130 --> 10:32.495
Who is that again?

10:32.630 --> 10:34.667
That's Gerson.
Don't worry. I vetted him.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.120
He's got full clearance.

10:40.050 --> 10:42.542
-I still can't find it.
-What?

10:42.680 --> 10:45.593
The sub-basement, or whatever
it was I found the other night.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.722
I keep walking down
all these corridors,

10:47.850 --> 10:49.136
but I end up going in circles.

10:49.480 --> 10:50.470
Dud...

10:51.150 --> 10:52.549
this is the basement.

10:52.690 --> 10:55.773
-I know.
-We're as low as we can go, trust me.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.733
Hey, maybe he found
the Parabola Group.

11:00.530 --> 11:02.521
That would be funny. That's funny.

11:02.950 --> 11:03.985
What's that?

11:04.120 --> 11:05.906
It's an Orbis legend from the '60s.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.156
Engineers doing experiments
in secret labs.

11:08.290 --> 11:10.361
The old joke,
whenever somebody got laid off,

11:10.500 --> 11:13.834
we say, "They were transferred
to the Parabola Group."

11:13.960 --> 11:14.995
Yeah.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.180
If you can get the filing done
this week, it would a huge help.

11:20.550 --> 11:23.542
I'll be gone the next few days,
but Gary will be in and out.

11:25.510 --> 11:26.671
Did you get all that?

11:27.430 --> 11:28.420
Yeah.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.221
Absolutely. Ready for action.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.686
-All right.
-OK.

11:32.810 --> 11:33.800
Bye.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.376
You can go up now.

12:08.520 --> 12:09.510
Nice view.

12:11.020 --> 12:12.181
Are you OK?

12:12.560 --> 12:15.552
No, but I will carry on bravely.

12:15.690 --> 12:17.476
That's what men do. Welcome.

12:19.820 --> 12:22.949
-A little light reading?
-Yeah. Janet assigned it.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.316
Me? Yes, You! Janet?

12:26.450 --> 12:29.363
Yeah. She plays all the angles.
I don't mind.

12:29.490 --> 12:31.709
It makes me sound complex
and interesting,

12:31.830 --> 12:33.412
which obviously I am not.

12:33.960 --> 12:34.950
Obviously.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.581
A lot of exciting stuff in there.

12:39.340 --> 12:40.330
Yeah.

12:40.920 --> 12:41.751
Come on.

12:41.880 --> 12:44.929
There's an aptitude test, an essay,
some basic paperwork.

12:45.050 --> 12:48.008
Then you'll meet Tara, the gatekeeper
for our training program.

12:48.140 --> 12:50.928
This is all a formality.
Seriously, just have fun with it.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.978
Fun? Oh, yeah, I'm all about fun.

12:55.060 --> 12:56.550
I'm really glad you're here.

12:58.150 --> 12:59.720
Well, lead the way, comrade.

13:04.860 --> 13:06.066
Tell me again about...

13:06.910 --> 13:09.151
What was the name of that place
where you grew up?

13:11.120 --> 13:12.326
Ah, yes.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.706
It was...

13:16.290 --> 13:17.371
Heathshire...

13:18.210 --> 13:19.416
on The Fens...

13:21.300 --> 13:23.371
in Lower Yorkingham.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.620
Sounds magical.

13:30.350 --> 13:31.556
There's a mouse in here.

13:32.060 --> 13:33.721
More vermin, great.

13:33.850 --> 13:35.682
Last year it was cockroaches.

13:37.060 --> 13:39.392
Larry really let some things go.

13:41.360 --> 13:44.398
But you thought he was
a good Sovereign Protector.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.738
Well, admin
was never really his strong suit.

13:49.490 --> 13:52.403
He didn't believe in the alchemical
tenets until the end, but...

13:53.370 --> 13:55.247
when I got here,
my life was a mess...

13:55.830 --> 13:57.821
and Larry was really good to me.

13:59.420 --> 14:01.377
I don't know where I'd be
without the Lodge.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.138
What do you think London
is going to say about this?

14:10.800 --> 14:11.801
About what?

14:11.930 --> 14:12.965
All of this.

14:13.430 --> 14:15.307
The... The library,

14:15.430 --> 14:17.057
Wallace Smith,

14:17.190 --> 14:20.228
Larry and his scrolls,
the True Lodge.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.816
I don't care what London thinks.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.310
I only care what you think.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.646
Me? Why?

14:27.110 --> 14:30.444
Because you're the only one here
with true vision.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.231
Larry... lost it.

14:34.580 --> 14:37.572
I mean, you laughed when Ernie
told you everything he said.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.745
We all laughed.

14:39.620 --> 14:40.621
But...

14:41.540 --> 14:42.780
I don't know. The...

14:42.920 --> 14:45.548
The legend of Harwood Fritz Merrill.

14:45.670 --> 14:48.219
-The years he spent wandering.
-The lost decade.

14:48.340 --> 14:49.967
I know that the story

14:50.090 --> 14:53.390
of Merrill finding ancient scrolls
in Egypt is a myth,

14:53.510 --> 14:55.672
but there's
historical precedent for it.

14:55.810 --> 14:58.268
-Sure, sure. The Dead Sea Scrolls.
-Right.

14:58.390 --> 15:00.097
-The Nag Hammadi library.
-Exactly.

15:00.230 --> 15:01.766
And look where we're standing.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.972
We found a secret library
in Long Beach!

15:05.730 --> 15:09.610
I know
I'm the alchemy weirdo around here.

15:10.030 --> 15:12.271
I believe every word Larry said.

15:12.410 --> 15:14.526
-You do?
-Yes.

15:14.660 --> 15:18.073
And I'm sure Ernie and Dud know
a lot more than they're letting on.

15:18.910 --> 15:20.207
I don't know about that.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.877
Ernie's a straight shooter,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.834
and I think Dud knows less
than he lets on.

15:28.170 --> 15:31.583
I didn't tell you,
but Wallace Smith had a diary.

15:33.050 --> 15:35.633
-I found it in his robes.
-What's in it?

15:35.760 --> 15:38.092
I don't know. It's in code.
I couldn't figure it out.

15:38.560 --> 15:39.630
Bring it to me...

15:40.440 --> 15:41.430
and...

15:42.350 --> 15:44.478
we'll decipher it together.

15:53.740 --> 15:55.572
Your rsum is interesting.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.076
You mean shitty?

15:59.910 --> 16:01.708
I just mean non-traditional.

16:03.210 --> 16:04.621
So...
shitty.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.754
Most of our applicants
have college degrees, at least.

16:10.510 --> 16:12.547
I could have gone to college.

16:12.680 --> 16:17.254
I just decided that I wanted to learn
how things work in the real world.

16:18.220 --> 16:19.267
And what did you learn?

16:19.390 --> 16:22.439
I learned that the real world is...

16:23.140 --> 16:24.471
well, a nightmare.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.429
You know?

16:26.770 --> 16:28.522
It's full of death

16:28.650 --> 16:30.937
and... happy hours,

16:31.070 --> 16:34.700
and men _
who order appetizers for dinner

16:34.820 --> 16:39.940
and then just stare at you
with the frozen eyes of a gargoyle.

16:45.210 --> 16:49.909
But it's also kind of
a fun challenge.

16:50.590 --> 16:51.910
And, if nothing else,

16:52.050 --> 16:54.428
I've learned
that I can handle myself.

16:55.550 --> 16:57.348
I can handle anything.

16:58.220 --> 16:59.710
-So, if I--
-I learned...

17:01.100 --> 17:03.592
I learned that I like work.

17:04.730 --> 17:06.800
I like pressure. I like the grind.

17:06.940 --> 17:10.319
I like the feeling
of figuring something out.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.732
But... I also learned

17:13.859 --> 17:17.194
that I haven't found my calling yet.

17:17.319 --> 17:18.776
I haven't found the right place,

17:18.910 --> 17:20.195
but when I do,

17:20.329 --> 17:22.992
I'm going to make that place
a million times better,

17:23.119 --> 17:24.406
and it's just a matter of...

17:26.829 --> 17:28.069
Sorry. Am I rambling?

17:28.710 --> 17:30.030
I think I might be rambling.

17:30.170 --> 17:31.160
OK.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.087
I'd like you to meet
a couple more people on my team.

17:38.340 --> 17:40.923
-When will I know if I'm in?
-This week.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.018
We go over materials and test scores.
There's a background check.

17:46.230 --> 17:49.188
Sorry, I need to use the restroom.

17:49.310 --> 17:51.187
Right there.
We'll be in the mezzanine.

18:22.510 --> 18:26.014
Yeah, I did everything that you said,
and still no change. Nothing.

18:26.140 --> 18:27.130
Strange.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.649
I've been adhering
to the doctrine of signatures.

18:31.690 --> 18:33.476
Remember what Paracelsus said.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.277
"What wounds a man heals him."

18:35.400 --> 18:37.061
Yeah, Paracelsus. I read about him.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.020
Greatest mind of his generation.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.650
Yeah. Died in a tavern brawl.

18:41.570 --> 18:43.402
Have you considered...

18:44.410 --> 18:46.401
that your injury
might be all in your head?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.570
In my...? OK.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.577
See this? Not in my head, right?

18:51.710 --> 18:55.203
I'm talking about correspondence -
the body and spirit.

18:55.340 --> 18:56.876
As above, so below.

18:57.010 --> 19:01.129
Our earthly medicines
obey the will of the stars.

19:01.260 --> 19:03.888
Because your wound
isn't just your wound.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.960
It belongs to all of us.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.727
The universe is broken.

19:09.640 --> 19:10.721
Can you fix it?

19:12.610 --> 19:13.600
Sorry, what?

19:14.650 --> 19:17.108
Alchemic healing takes patience
and repetition.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.560
Then the moment comes.

19:20.070 --> 19:22.698
A spark sets everything into motion

19:22.820 --> 19:24.822
and the constellation
clicks into place.

19:24.950 --> 19:26.941
That's what happened
with my parasite.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.741
We never know
quite what the spark will be.

19:32.080 --> 19:36.586
But sometimes we must take drastic
measures in order to set it off.

19:43.680 --> 19:44.966
I got your message.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.051
What the hell happened?

19:48.470 --> 19:49.676
We don't know.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.011
A trucker found him
on the side of the road.

19:53.650 --> 19:54.856
This is on you, Ernie.

19:55.270 --> 19:57.181
-You have blood on your hands.
-What?

19:57.900 --> 20:00.483
You talked me into
this whole Captain nonsense.

20:00.820 --> 20:03.869
You got greedy,
and now Beautiful Jeff's gonna die.

20:03.990 --> 20:05.901
He's just very badly dehydrated.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.902
If you had sent me,
I would have closed the deal,

20:09.040 --> 20:11.361
but you didn't,
so it's not my problem.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.747
I'm done with Captain.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.992
Look at him.
So young, so much promise.

20:19.380 --> 20:21.257
He was gonna light up
the whole industry.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.343
Jesus. This is the stuff
poets write poems about.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.250
Any of you know how to write a poem?

20:30.560 --> 20:33.018
I don't want to see Beautiful Jeff
alone for a minute.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.436
We're gonna take shifts, OK?

20:35.560 --> 20:37.892
And if you don't have time
for a shift, you can quit.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.541
Sorry for the ambush,
but I've been calling you for hours.

21:06.970 --> 21:07.960
Come in.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.510
This is nice.

21:14.190 --> 21:15.225
No, it isn't.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.017
-What do you want?
-Why did you take off today?

21:20.530 --> 21:23.238
Tara was gushing about you.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.311
Your test scores were great,

21:25.450 --> 21:27.066
your essay was amazing.

21:27.570 --> 21:29.026
I don't understand.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.071
I was saving everybody the trouble.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.075
What?

21:33.200 --> 21:36.113
The background check -
it's cost me jobs before.

21:36.960 --> 21:37.950
What did you do?

21:39.210 --> 21:40.996
Well, a felony is a felony.

21:42.130 --> 21:46.545
If it makes you feel any better,
I have also run afoul of the law.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.751
-For what? _
-Screw you. None of your business.

21:51.930 --> 21:53.136
OK. Well...

21:54.730 --> 21:58.189
Well, maybe sometime
we can get some food

21:58.310 --> 22:01.393
and reveal our disgusting crimes.

22:01.900 --> 22:03.811
Yes, let's do that.

22:06.610 --> 22:08.066
Well, give me a hint, at least.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.821
It involves Homeland Security.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.241
Oh, shit.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.178
Oh, my God!

22:27.300 --> 22:28.290
OK, here we go.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.302
Parabola Group meets at midnight.

22:32.890 --> 22:34.517
Death from above.

22:34.640 --> 22:35.630
OK.

22:36.930 --> 22:38.512
What was that about?

22:40.480 --> 22:42.858
Nothing.
Nothing's happening at midnight.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.231
Is something happening at Orbis?

22:50.700 --> 22:53.271
Yeah. Yeah, and it's awesome.

22:53.410 --> 22:54.980
But it's a secret. I can't tell you.

22:55.410 --> 22:58.368
You've got to talk to Gil,
because he'll give you the clearance.

22:58.500 --> 22:59.786
I don't have the authority.

23:01.790 --> 23:03.417
Yeah. OK.

23:04.380 --> 23:06.371
But don't tell him
I said anything, OK?

23:08.470 --> 23:09.585
But don't you see?

23:10.010 --> 23:12.672
Smith used several alphabets,

23:12.800 --> 23:16.134
as well as multiple species of
decknamen here in the margins.

23:16.270 --> 23:18.136
Of course. Of course.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.187
Sorry to interrupt the party.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.186
Avery, man,

23:23.310 --> 23:24.641
can we talk?

23:25.190 --> 23:26.180
Of course.

23:26.730 --> 23:28.061
I am at your service.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.613
I was just wondering
how things are going...

23:33.160 --> 23:34.901
timetable-wise?

23:35.030 --> 23:36.111
Don't worry.

23:36.620 --> 23:38.110
I have everything I need.

23:38.790 --> 23:40.576
I'll make my report
to London tomorrow.

23:41.370 --> 23:43.702
Ernie, my Luminous friend...

23:44.500 --> 23:47.049
you can start packing your bags
for the Grand Tour.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.006
Yes. Yes!

23:51.130 --> 23:52.791
Bring it in! Yes!

23:54.390 --> 23:56.427
I really needed to hear that.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.511
What kind of training did you get?

24:00.640 --> 24:02.051
They gave me a flashlight.

24:03.270 --> 24:04.260
Oh, Jesus.

24:04.770 --> 24:06.181
Yeah, you and me, man.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.527
We are the thin blue line, right?

24:14.030 --> 24:16.738
So, how did you get
the Harbor Patrol gig, anyway?

24:16.870 --> 24:18.690
Well, hey, it's not a gig.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.246
It's a calling.

24:21.080 --> 24:24.072
And... Larry had a guy at the harbor.

24:25.920 --> 24:28.127
Larry... Larry had a guy everywhere.

24:29.420 --> 24:30.581
You ever needed...

24:31.510 --> 24:33.421
I don't know, bricks,

24:33.550 --> 24:34.711
they had a brick guy,

24:34.840 --> 24:36.797
and a carburetor guy,

24:36.930 --> 24:38.500
and on and on,

24:38.640 --> 24:40.176
all over town!

24:41.140 --> 24:43.131
I want to be a guy with guys,
you know?

24:43.690 --> 24:45.806
Yeah, well,
Larry and my dad were pals.

24:45.940 --> 24:47.681
That's the only reason they helped.

24:49.690 --> 24:51.180
Larry never really liked me.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.310
Attention!

24:52.860 --> 24:55.409
I advise everyone to hit up Ernie

24:55.530 --> 24:57.771
for as many drinks
as they can tonight,

24:57.910 --> 25:02.154
because soon he'll be going
on his Grand Tour!

25:02.710 --> 25:03.825
All right, Ernie!

25:05.000 --> 25:06.820
Excuse me. Excuse me.

25:07.630 --> 25:08.700
I'm sorry for the delay.

25:08.840 --> 25:12.378
I would have called when I landed,
but I have just been through

25:12.510 --> 25:16.048
the most humiliating ordeal
of my life.

25:16.550 --> 25:19.633
On the flight, a deranged child
stole my wallet and my phone,

25:19.760 --> 25:24.186
and upon arrival I was detained
for three days by Customs.

25:24.980 --> 25:27.722
Anyway, anyway...
That's my tale of woe.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.430
I'm finally here.

25:30.980 --> 25:33.779
I'm supposed to speak to somebody
called Larry Loomis.

25:34.700 --> 25:35.815
Is he available?

25:39.950 --> 25:42.612
Well, I didn't expect a parade
when I arrived,

25:42.750 --> 25:44.457
but a simple "hello" would be nice.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.200
Who are you?

25:46.830 --> 25:49.333
Jocelyn Pugh.
I'm the emissary from London.

26:20.740 --> 26:21.730
Sorry.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.867
I thought we had some clean sheets.

26:24.290 --> 26:26.281
Oh, no, no, no. It will be fine.

26:27.290 --> 26:29.702
Scott's going to see
what he can find out about Avery,

26:29.830 --> 26:33.243
and Blaise went home
because he's kind of a mess.

26:33.380 --> 26:35.758
Yeah, it's my fault.
I should have been here days ago.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.712
No, man. This is nobody's fault.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.252
I just have no idea what's going on.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.808
I'll sort it out in the morning.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.301
I just need a good night's sleep.

26:45.430 --> 26:47.683
Did you tell him about
the library and the corpse?

26:48.020 --> 26:49.340
-What?
-Long story.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.016
We'll fill you in tomorrow.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.936
OK. Well...

26:55.650 --> 26:57.778
Welcome to Lodge 49.

26:58.490 --> 26:59.980
-Thanks.
-All right.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.612
Hey, I always thought that Jocelyn
was a girl's name.

27:28.850 --> 27:31.182
-A giant trebuchet?
-It's French.

27:31.310 --> 27:33.108
This thing's gonna be a monster.

27:33.230 --> 27:35.267
We're welding the final pieces
in J wing,

27:35.400 --> 27:38.529
and we're confident that we'll
be able to launch that fridge there

27:38.650 --> 27:39.811
into the harbor.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.099
If you tell anyone,

27:42.240 --> 27:44.732
Parabola Group will hunt you down
and kill you.

27:49.120 --> 27:49.951
Isn't it great?

27:50.080 --> 27:51.821
-Yeah.
-I want to get Ernie down here.

27:51.960 --> 27:55.669
I think it might help
get his mind off things.

27:56.090 --> 27:57.080
How is Ernie?

27:57.880 --> 28:00.508
-Hard to tell.
-Oh, his stoic bullshit.

28:02.300 --> 28:03.711
I don't mean Ernie.

28:04.850 --> 28:05.840
I just mean...

28:07.470 --> 28:08.460
men in general.

28:09.350 --> 28:11.978
What's gonna happen to these people

28:12.100 --> 28:13.898
when all of this goes away for good?

28:16.900 --> 28:17.890
The Lodge.

28:19.570 --> 28:20.731
That's what they need.

28:21.740 --> 28:23.526
That's what we need to do,
me and Ernie.

28:24.280 --> 28:25.111
What?

28:25.570 --> 28:26.731
Fill the Lodge again.

28:27.830 --> 28:30.071
You know, make it like it was
in the golden age.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.622
And if I heal the universe...

28:36.290 --> 28:37.416
I heal my foot.

28:56.860 --> 28:57.975
Are you ready yet?

28:58.110 --> 29:00.772
It's Bunco night
and everybody's getting restless.

29:01.780 --> 29:02.770
Yeah, yeah.

29:04.610 --> 29:08.069
Sit down. I think it's going
to be better if you sit down.

29:09.830 --> 29:11.787
Scott couldn't find anything
on Avery.

29:11.910 --> 29:14.823
I know. I doubt if they would.
That's not his real name.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.121
I made some calls.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.332
London knows all about
this Avery character.

29:18.460 --> 29:21.669
He's a crackpot and a thief. There
have been calls from other lodges.

29:21.800 --> 29:24.258
He shows up, ingratiates himself,

29:24.380 --> 29:25.506
and robs the place.

29:25.630 --> 29:26.631
He fooled us.

29:26.760 --> 29:30.549
He really fooled Blaise,
but I don't think he stole anything.

29:30.680 --> 29:36.096
Ernie, this Avery business
is really a small matter.

29:36.230 --> 29:39.609
Good. Now, I'm ready to talk
succession, for real this time.

29:39.730 --> 29:41.562
No, I mean, it's a small matter

29:41.690 --> 29:43.931
compared to the vast...

29:44.900 --> 29:45.901
well...

29:46.360 --> 29:48.522
conspiracy - there's no other word -

29:48.660 --> 29:51.903
the vast conspiracy
that surrounds Larry.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.952
You mean the scrolls
and the True Lodge and...?

29:55.080 --> 29:56.320
You said that was nonsense.

29:56.460 --> 29:59.532
No, I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about the books here.

30:00.790 --> 30:03.703
Larry committed
some rather major crimes.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.541
Listen, ten years ago,

30:07.680 --> 30:09.751
after the financial crash,

30:09.890 --> 30:12.006
the Order's endowment took a big hit

30:12.140 --> 30:16.805
and we closed dozens of derelict
lodges and sold off the properties,

30:16.940 --> 30:19.477
and that's what was gonna happen
to Lodge 49.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.146
The membership was way down.

30:21.270 --> 30:23.147
Larry hadn't paid the tithe
for years.

30:24.570 --> 30:27.312
Not long after London
sent the notice,

30:27.450 --> 30:29.441
Larry sent London a huge check

30:29.570 --> 30:32.232
and a long list of new members,
and London was happy.

30:33.700 --> 30:36.783
-But now... I see--
-See what?

30:39.790 --> 30:41.497
There's been a massive fraud.

30:43.210 --> 30:44.291
It's complicated.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.661
I don't know how he pulled it off...

30:47.550 --> 30:50.008
but he forged some documents
in our name

30:50.140 --> 30:52.427
and managed to take out
a giant mortgage

30:52.560 --> 30:54.927
from a Chinese bank on this place.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.382
He must have pocketed
a big chunk of cash,

30:58.520 --> 31:01.729
but the money's been running out,
and as far as I can tell,

31:01.860 --> 31:03.931
he's been living off bar receipts

31:04.070 --> 31:06.277
and membership dues
the last few years.

31:08.280 --> 31:10.237
He's been living off all of you.

31:12.580 --> 31:13.399
What?

31:14.870 --> 31:18.249
There's a huge balloon payment due
in a couple of months.

31:19.540 --> 31:20.826
It was all coming down on him.

31:20.960 --> 31:23.452
He didn't have the money,
he knew London would find out.

31:24.130 --> 31:27.043
I think that little story he told you
about the scrolls

31:27.170 --> 31:28.376
and the True Lodge...

31:29.760 --> 31:31.671
I think he told you those things

31:31.800 --> 31:34.041
to get you to drive him
down to Mexico.

31:34.930 --> 31:37.672
He would have been facing
some serious charges.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.011
He was trying to escape.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.060
So, what happens now?

31:48.190 --> 31:49.271
I don't know.

31:49.820 --> 31:52.903
London's on the hook
for almost $300,000.

31:54.070 --> 31:59.531
I assume they will just
let the bank foreclose.

32:03.710 --> 32:04.745
I'm sorry.

32:10.800 --> 32:13.337
That lying sack of shit.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.290
Just because Larry stole money

32:15.430 --> 32:17.808
doesn't mean that he was lying
about the scrolls.

32:17.930 --> 32:19.921
The night he had a heart attack,
he said it.

32:20.060 --> 32:22.518
"It's all a forgery.
We're not the True Lodge."

32:22.650 --> 32:24.607
He was talking about himself, man!

32:24.940 --> 32:28.103
He's nothing but a con man!
A con man!

32:28.230 --> 32:30.232
Stop! Hey! Ernie, wait!

32:30.360 --> 32:31.350
I...

32:32.280 --> 32:33.770
trusted him, man!

32:33.910 --> 32:35.560
Ernie, calm... calm down.

32:40.080 --> 32:41.070
Shit!

32:54.720 --> 32:55.881
Please don't be mad.

32:58.970 --> 33:00.460
I should call the police...

33:01.140 --> 33:02.630
you fraud.

33:02.770 --> 33:05.262
Go ahead. I won't stop you.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.396
Are you here to return the diary?

33:08.520 --> 33:09.521
No.

33:10.190 --> 33:12.318
I'm here o
because I want you to join me.

33:12.900 --> 33:16.063
There is a way to make real gold,
but it's not how you think.

33:16.700 --> 33:19.579
I've been looking for the True Lodge
for a long time,

33:19.700 --> 33:23.910
and I'm convinced Lodge 49
is our way in.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.668
Somehow, the diary's our key.

33:28.750 --> 33:31.754
Come with me... and we'll find
the True Lodge together.

33:31.880 --> 33:33.416
I don't care about gold.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.382
I'm a doctor, a healer.

33:36.510 --> 33:39.172
And besides,
I made a copy of the diary,

33:39.300 --> 33:42.463
so I have as good a chance
to solve it as you do.

33:43.060 --> 33:45.518
You're right. I am a fraud.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.602
But that means I can spot
the genuine article.

33:48.730 --> 33:51.813
You are on your way
to becoming a true alchemist,

33:51.940 --> 33:54.022
maybe the first I've ever met.

33:54.650 --> 33:56.448
But you have to be willing
to go further.

33:59.410 --> 34:00.400
Take chances.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.507
Perhaps... we'll meet again

34:18.639 --> 34:22.304
in that place
where all circles vanish.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.637
Or you can email me, either way.

34:33.860 --> 34:36.397
Payday loan. You know how these work?

34:36.530 --> 34:37.520
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

34:38.610 --> 34:41.068
Herm, be gentle with it, all right?

34:41.199 --> 34:43.110
Just put it in the back seat
of the Thing.

34:43.830 --> 34:45.650
OK. All right. Well...

34:46.790 --> 34:47.780
Sorry, Burt.

34:48.290 --> 34:49.780
Justice has been served.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.708
Yeah. So... you can suck it.

35:09.390 --> 35:10.391
OK.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.442
...and Ryan,
he's gonna try for two!

35:18.570 --> 35:19.856
Here's the throw!

35:25.240 --> 35:26.241
Hey...

35:35.210 --> 35:36.200
Hey!

35:38.840 --> 35:39.830
I'm sorr--

35:40.470 --> 35:43.098
Ernie, I was trying to do
a nice thing, man.

35:43.220 --> 35:45.507
-I'm your squire.
-You're no squire!

35:45.640 --> 35:46.926
You're a curse!

35:47.060 --> 35:48.767
Since you showed up at the Lodge,

35:48.890 --> 35:51.348
everything in my life
has gone to hell!

35:51.480 --> 35:53.437
No, you're just seeing it wrong.

35:53.560 --> 35:55.267
Our fates are intertwined.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.186
You know, you can't get away from me.

35:57.320 --> 36:00.233
The constellations are falling
into place. It's you and me, man.

36:00.360 --> 36:03.864
-We're gonna save the Lodge!
-The Lodge is gone!

36:03.990 --> 36:06.368
And there's no you and me!

36:06.490 --> 36:08.618
You're just another spoiled white kid

36:08.750 --> 36:11.208
who thinks everything
revolves around him!

36:13.330 --> 36:14.320
You know what?

36:15.630 --> 36:18.201
At least I'm not screwing
my friend's wife.

36:19.380 --> 36:21.007
Go. Now.

36:21.590 --> 36:23.331
Before I light your ass up.

36:23.470 --> 36:25.347
-No way.
-OK. All right.

36:25.470 --> 36:28.098
Not before I get my two grand back
that you stole from me!

36:28.220 --> 36:30.848
-OK.
-Yeah, you're the con man, man.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.721
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me in the--

36:33.520 --> 36:36.512
Jesus! Ernie! Ernie, come on!

36:37.980 --> 36:39.106
Come on!

36:39.230 --> 36:40.732
Stop! Ernie!

36:43.820 --> 36:44.946
God!

36:45.070 --> 36:48.950
Drugs. It was just drugs.
Possession with the intent to sell.

36:49.080 --> 36:51.538
I was a sophomore at Fresno State
and I got probation.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.917
-That's it?
-Yeah, I know.

36:54.040 --> 36:56.168
Pretty boring,
like everything else about me.

36:56.790 --> 36:57.780
Your turn.

36:59.130 --> 37:00.120
OK.

37:03.050 --> 37:04.882
Summer after my senior year,

37:05.010 --> 37:07.251
I was out celebrating
with some friends.

37:08.470 --> 37:10.632
We ended up
at this party in Rossmoor,

37:10.770 --> 37:13.592
and things got a little out of hand.

37:14.390 --> 37:16.609
One thing led to another,

37:16.730 --> 37:18.641
and then, sometime around dawn,

37:18.770 --> 37:21.319
I found myself driving a forklift

37:21.440 --> 37:24.148
down the runway
at the Long Beach Airport.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.067
That is the stuff of legend.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.071
-Thanks.
-And what were you celebrating?

37:30.950 --> 37:32.111
I don't remember...

37:33.750 --> 37:34.740
really.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.918
Janet is nuts.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.206
But she keeps things interesting.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.589
And I have embraced
the Omni West Circus, plus the money.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.132
-You'll see.
-Oh, and a corporate apartment.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.307
Why do you work at Shamroxx?

37:54.100 --> 37:56.011
-I told you - cash.
-Yeah, I get that.

37:56.140 --> 37:58.051
But what do you dream about?

38:01.860 --> 38:02.850
Zero.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.481
What?

38:05.900 --> 38:09.313
All T think about all day long
is paying off my debt.

38:10.910 --> 38:12.867
Every night,
I check the balance online,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.492
and I just sit there and...

38:16.370 --> 38:19.123
dream about the day it says "zero."

38:20.340 --> 38:22.741
So, you pay off your debt.
And then what?

38:26.680 --> 38:30.298
Well, I read somewhere
that debt isn't the worst thing.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.421
It binds people together.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.091
It's an excuse for a relationship.

38:38.810 --> 38:40.801
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

38:49.870 --> 38:50.905
You know, I...

38:53.910 --> 38:55.867
I got into a couple of schools.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.992
That's what I was celebrating
the night I got arrested.

39:00.500 --> 39:03.083
My dad wanted me
to go to college so bad.

39:04.710 --> 39:08.260
You know, he didn't want me stuck
at the pool shop with my brother.

39:08.380 --> 39:11.133
Like, it was good enough for Dud,
but not for me.

39:12.550 --> 39:16.555
I was supposed to go off
and do great things, but, no.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.471
I wasn't gonna let
something good happen.

39:24.610 --> 39:26.647
I never thought I'd end up here.

39:29.150 --> 39:30.151
Here we are.

39:32.700 --> 39:33.690
It's not so bad.

41:34.860 --> 41:35.850
OK.

42:02.430 --> 42:03.420
Ernie.

42:03.890 --> 42:05.096
I'm glad you're here.

42:05.640 --> 42:07.051
I took a shot at the poem.

42:15.950 --> 42:19.022
"Your many hairs
make a single head of hair...

42:20.030 --> 42:22.328
the way many mountains make a range.

42:23.330 --> 42:26.709
To see you void of light is strange.

42:27.330 --> 42:31.085
But we know you will tower again...

42:31.920 --> 42:33.456
like a noble tulip...

42:34.210 --> 42:36.793
above the lawn of the possible."

42:39.930 --> 42:40.920
Jesus, Bob.

42:41.260 --> 42:42.967
I know, but it's a first draft.

42:44.720 --> 42:45.926
I'm gonna get some coffee.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.356
-Is he gone?
-What?

42:54.480 --> 42:56.107
-When did you--
-I found Captain!

42:56.240 --> 42:57.696
What? Really?

42:58.360 --> 43:00.909
Grab my pants.
There's a brochure in the pocket.

43:11.000 --> 43:11.990
This?

43:12.630 --> 43:13.916
I found him there.

43:14.050 --> 43:16.200
He's like a god, Ernie, truly.

43:16.630 --> 43:18.678
He snaps his fingers
and the world is born.

43:20.340 --> 43:21.922
I was so close to him.

43:22.680 --> 43:24.887
We were swimming in a giant pool.

43:25.970 --> 43:29.053
-What the hell happened to you?
-Captain has all the answers, Ernie.

43:30.230 --> 43:31.766
You need to go to the desert.

43:32.110 --> 43:33.396
You need to find him.

43:35.400 --> 43:38.028
Stone did another line
and looked out the window.

43:38.820 --> 43:41.562
The square was empty,
but he knew he'd been followed.

43:42.070 --> 43:45.233
It was a trap,
and soon he would die.

43:45.700 --> 43:47.247
But even in that terrible moment,

43:47.370 --> 43:50.362
he felt something beautiful
in the scene below.

43:51.210 --> 43:54.032
The moonlight was soft
and welcoming...

43:54.790 --> 43:57.088
like the legs of a Silesian whore,

44:52.060 --> 44:53.050
What the hell?

44:59.110 --> 45:02.899
I can't believe... you came
all this way just to apologize.

45:03.030 --> 45:04.691
-That's really--
-Dud, man...

45:05.320 --> 45:08.654
I don't know what you're doing out
here, but I'm looking for Captain.

45:09.910 --> 45:11.036
-Captain?
-Right.

45:12.160 --> 45:13.150
Captain.

45:13.620 --> 45:14.951
Captain, man. Captain.

45:15.080 --> 45:16.707
-Cap... Right.
-Yeah.

45:18.380 --> 45:20.451
I think you mean Gary.

45:21.300 --> 45:22.290
Gary?

45:22.720 --> 45:23.710
Yeah.

45:27.800 --> 45:28.631
Gary.

45:33.980 --> 45:35.186
That's Captain?
