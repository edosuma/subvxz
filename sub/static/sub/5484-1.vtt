01:02.200 --> 01:04.156
Translation: Kajsa von Hofsten

01:07.720 --> 01:11.076
TO KABI
MY WIFE

01:50.560 --> 01:55.475
- I was first up on the jetty!
- That was refreshing.

01:56.160 --> 01:59.311
If dad and Martin set the nets,
Minus and I can fetch the milk.

01:59.440 --> 02:03.513
No, David and Minus can set the nets
so I can take a walk with my wife.

02:03.640 --> 02:07.189
Or Karin and I can set the nets
and Minus and Martin fetch the milk.

02:07.320 --> 02:11.677
I don't want to do either.
I'll decide for myself what I want to do.

02:11.800 --> 02:16.749
- Why don't we go, Minus?
- Why should women always decide?

02:16.880 --> 02:22.273
I say we do what Karin decides!
That way we won't lose our dignity.

02:22.400 --> 02:27.110
We'd have gained a lot of time
if dad had decided that straight away!

02:28.520 --> 02:31.557
Should we get dressed
before we set the nets?

02:31.680 --> 02:36.674
- What do you think?
- It's a bit chilly. My robe is quite thin.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.758
- If you're cold...
- Me cold? Not a bit. Are you cold?

02:39.880 --> 02:44.351
It was you who said it was chilly.
There's a bit of a wind, though...

02:44.480 --> 02:48.553
We'll harden ourselves.
Virility overrules health - right?

02:48.680 --> 02:52.275
If Hemingway can do it, so can we!
Forward march!

03:15.280 --> 03:18.636
- Will there be a thunderstorm?
- Not tonight.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.752
I don't know - Iook at those clouds...

03:21.880 --> 03:26.078
- Are you afraid of the thunder?
- A darned violent fear.

03:26.200 --> 03:30.318
- The thunderstorms in Switzerland...
- Did you like it there otherwise?

03:30.440 --> 03:35.434
I was homesick. But I wasn't coming
home until I'd finished the novel.

03:35.560 --> 03:39.269
- And is it finished now?
- Yes, pretty much.

03:39.400 --> 03:44.758
- How is your stomach ulcer?
- So-so. Can you give me something?

03:44.880 --> 03:48.953
We can go to the chemist's tomorrow.
I have a few errands to run.

03:50.280 --> 03:54.637
Did you get my last letter?
I sent it off on Monday.

03:54.760 --> 03:59.072
- I was with the Waldstein's in Basel.
- Then you didn't get my letter.

03:59.200 --> 04:03.239
- Then I flew here on Wednesday.
- Then you didn't get it.

04:03.360 --> 04:06.750
- Was it important?
- It was about Karin.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.269
I felt I had to write to you.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.312
Even if it would interrupt your writing.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.478
- A cuckoo. Didn't you hear it?
- No.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.238
- Surely, you must hear it now?
- Where?

04:31.120 --> 04:35.033
- When did you last wash your ears?
- You're hearing too much!

04:35.160 --> 04:38.709
After my illness, my hearing
has become so acute.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.673
Maybe it's the electric shock therapy.

04:43.440 --> 04:47.592
Wasn't dad looking grey yesterday
when he arrived from Switzerland?

04:47.720 --> 04:51.998
He was tired after the journey.
But he doesn't look happy.

04:52.120 --> 04:56.193
- Is Marianne coming here?
- Martin said they broke up.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.279
- Poor dad, alone again.
- I never liked Marianne.

05:00.400 --> 05:04.598
She put on such airs.
Dad became all ordinary next to her.

05:04.720 --> 05:10.078
- And then she sneered at his books.
- He has to get good reviews.

05:10.200 --> 05:14.716
- But everybody reads his books!
- He doesn't care about the sales.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.400
He wants to be a poet.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.988
What are you laughing at?

05:22.120 --> 05:26.989
You're so tall, and so serious!
"He wants to be a poet"...

05:29.040 --> 05:32.828
Don't look so stung.
I love you, little Minus!

05:34.680 --> 05:37.592
- You're so terribly tall!
- Stop being so silly!

05:37.720 --> 05:41.110
Seventeen and nearly ten feet tall!

05:41.840 --> 05:45.150
- Where's your girlfriend?
- No one wants to be with me!

05:45.280 --> 05:48.875
Don't be cross with me
for laughing at you.

06:06.520 --> 06:10.672
Edgar is the only psychiatrist I trust.
He's treated her all along.

06:11.560 --> 06:12.959
And?

06:14.480 --> 06:18.519
When Karin came home from
the hospital last month -

06:18.640 --> 06:21.279
- he and I had a good talk.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.673
He can't guarantee a lasting recovery.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.315
And now?

06:28.440 --> 06:30.908
She seems unusually well.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.873
Her sleep is a little unsettled.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.675
Her hearing has become very acute.
That's about it.

06:38.960 --> 06:43.033
- How much does she know?
- The truth about her illness.

06:43.160 --> 06:47.199
- But not that it's relatively incurable.
- Relatively, you say?

06:48.880 --> 06:52.919
Edgar has had cases of full recovery,
so there is some hope.

06:55.800 --> 06:59.190
- How are things between you?
- Fine, thank you.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.959
The days pass by as usual...

07:02.080 --> 07:07.313
I've been giving my lectures
and examined scores of students.

07:11.480 --> 07:16.270
I've come to realise that I love her,
and am helplessly bound up with her.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.391
Come what may...

07:18.520 --> 07:22.513
I've become the anchor of
her existence.

07:22.640 --> 07:25.234
Maybe her only security.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.273
I see.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.796
- Shall we go back to the nets?
- Yes, let's.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.871
Minus...

08:03.000 --> 08:05.195
Dear...

08:05.320 --> 08:08.995
Beware of me! Stay away!

08:09.120 --> 08:14.513
Stop hugging and kissing me. Don't
sunbathe half-naked, you disgust me!

08:14.640 --> 08:18.394
You know very well what I mean!
Women are horrible!

08:18.520 --> 08:23.389
They smell and move around,
they comb their hair and they talk!

08:23.520 --> 08:28.753
- Makes me feel like a skinned rabbit!
- Poor little you.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.190
Pity! I can provide
all the pity I want myself!

08:32.320 --> 08:36.552
What's wrong, my darling?
I've never seen you like this before.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.273
Please don't tell Martin or dad...

08:42.240 --> 08:44.150
Don't be silly!

08:45.200 --> 08:48.670
I wish I could talk to dad, just once!

08:48.800 --> 08:51.519
He's so wrapped up in himself.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.591
Him too.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.668
Let's go back now.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.912
- And I've spilt the milk too.
- Careless boy!

09:07.320 --> 09:12.394
- Damn! I hate hurting my fingers!
- Put a plaster on it!

09:12.520 --> 09:15.717
- Hello!
- Martin has cut his finger.

09:15.840 --> 09:19.116
- Let's have a look.
- I'll put the milk in the cellar.

09:19.240 --> 09:23.153
- It looks deep. Put a plaster on it.
- What a lot of fuss!

09:23.280 --> 09:27.478
How beautiful - lanterns
and supper under the moon!

09:30.720 --> 09:34.918
- You're a master chef, dad!
- It smells wonderful!

09:35.040 --> 09:37.508
Smell it, Minus...

09:38.560 --> 09:43.156
You should write cookery books
instead of novels!

09:43.280 --> 09:47.239
Listen, the seating...
Karin there, and you over there.

09:47.360 --> 09:50.238
Minus over there and me here.

09:51.320 --> 09:55.791
How I've longed for this moment!
I was homesick all the time.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.673
- For us?
- Yes, even for you...!

10:01.360 --> 10:04.079
- Are you staying?
- For this month, at least.

10:04.200 --> 10:09.433
- Are you going away again?
- I'm going to Yugoslavia as a guide.

10:09.560 --> 10:13.189
- A guide? Why?
- It's a very flattering offer.

10:13.320 --> 10:18.030
It's for a cultural delegation.
And since I know the country...

10:20.080 --> 10:24.278
- Well, David. Welcome home!
- Thank you.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.039
Your health, Karin. And yours, Minus!

10:33.360 --> 10:37.876
- But what about your book?
- I'll finish it before I go.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.595
I spoke to the publishers,
I'll be handing in the script next week.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.349
- Will you be away for long?
- I'm not sure...

10:45.480 --> 10:49.632
I may stay a while in Dubrovnik
after the others go home.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.678
I feel like a criminal for some reason.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.317
You promised to stay at home
after Switzerland.

11:06.280 --> 11:09.477
I don't remember
making any promises...

11:09.600 --> 11:12.114
Yes, Dad, you promised.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.838
- How unfortunate.
- Yes, it is.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.799
Listen... We were going to have
a nice evening -

11:30.920 --> 11:34.833
- and instead we're
on the verge of tears!

11:34.960 --> 11:38.475
I've got presents for you all
from Switzerland!

11:40.920 --> 11:42.353
Karin.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.436
And Martin.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.836
- Thanks, but you shouldn't...
- Minus.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.952
- Can we open them right away?
- Yes, do!

11:55.680 --> 11:58.513
Excuse me,
I have to fetch my tobacco.

12:03.120 --> 12:07.079
- I won't get these over my thumbs.
- I've got one just like this.

12:07.200 --> 12:12.752
- I bet he bought them in Stockholm.
- It was a kind thought.

13:15.400 --> 13:20.679
- Thank you so much, David!
- Thanks for the lovely gloves!

13:20.800 --> 13:23.997
We've got a surprise for you too!

13:24.120 --> 13:26.793
- We have to blindfold you.
- Don't peek!

13:26.920 --> 13:31.516
- I'll take care of this, you go ahead.
- I can't see a thing!

13:36.160 --> 13:40.472
It's like walking on clouds.
Who's idea is this?

13:40.600 --> 13:42.636
Mine and Karin's.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.990
Wait and see...

13:53.680 --> 13:56.433
This is almost like Shakespeare.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.231
Ready?

14:10.200 --> 14:14.637
Our play is called
"The Artistic Haunting".

14:14.760 --> 14:17.479
Or "The Tomb of Illusions".

14:18.040 --> 14:19.758
Let the play begin!

14:19.880 --> 14:23.236
It is midnight
in the Chapel of Saint Teresa.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.670
Here I shall meet her, my bride-elect.

14:26.800 --> 14:31.396
Here, by this tomb redolent with
the smell of death.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.990
Someone moved inside!
Could it be her?

14:35.120 --> 14:37.918
I shall hide, so as not to frighten her.

14:41.200 --> 14:45.079
- Who are you?
- I am the Princess of Castile.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.112
Died in childbirth
in her thirteenth year.

14:48.240 --> 14:52.028
My lord and beloved master,
who I played with as a child -

14:52.160 --> 14:54.435
- has turned to other women.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.869
Princess, I love you!

14:57.000 --> 15:02.279
But who are you? I cannot talk to
just anybody, even if I am dead.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.516
Fear not!

15:04.640 --> 15:09.031
I am lord of my own realm,
which is quite small and very poor.

15:09.160 --> 15:11.993
- I am an artist!
- An artist?

15:12.120 --> 15:15.396
Yes, Princess!
An artist of the purest kind.

15:15.520 --> 15:19.149
A poet with no poems,
a painter with no paintings...

15:21.560 --> 15:24.199
- Musician.
- A musician with no tones.

15:24.320 --> 15:29.155
I scorn the completed work of art,
the banal result of vulgar efforts.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.829
My life is my work,
and it is devoted to my love for you!

15:32.960 --> 15:37.431
- Beautiful but incredible words.
- I beg of you, put me to the test!

15:38.040 --> 15:41.794
Listen carefully,
I shall leave you soon.

15:41.920 --> 15:46.152
When the clock strikes two
you shall enter the tomb -

15:46.280 --> 15:49.033
- and blow out
the three candles inside.

15:49.920 --> 15:55.517
In that same moment the door will
close, and you shall join me in death.

15:55.640 --> 16:01.317
A light sacrifice, my Princess.
For what is life to a true artist?

16:07.520 --> 16:12.514
Thus you complete your work of art
and crown your love.

16:12.640 --> 16:18.351
Thus you ennoble your life and show
the sceptics the power of a true artist.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.476
Farewell, my friend.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.160
Do not fail me.

16:28.600 --> 16:33.628
I stand before the moment of ultimate
perfection! I tremble with anticipation.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.433
I enter oblivion.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.393
Only Death shall love me now.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.313
I will go, nothing can stop me now.

16:44.040 --> 16:47.635
- I am waiting.
- Ye devils, what am I about to do?

16:47.760 --> 16:50.115
Sacrifice my life - for what?

16:50.240 --> 16:54.631
For eternity? For the perfect
work of art? For love?

16:54.760 --> 16:57.672
- Have I gone mad?
- I am waiting.

16:57.800 --> 17:03.511
Who shall see my sacrifice? Death!
Who shall gauge my love? A ghost!

17:03.640 --> 17:07.713
- And who shall thank me? Eternity!
- I am waiting.

17:10.079 --> 17:14.278
My knees are like clay and I shake,
my insides are misbehaving.

17:14.400 --> 17:18.632
- I cannot enter eternity with...
- I shall not wait any longer.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.999
Well... such is life.

17:26.319 --> 17:29.551
I could of course write a poem
about the princess.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.592
Paint a picture or compose an opera -

17:32.720 --> 17:35.996
- although the ending
would be more heroic.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.193
I enter oblivion.

17:41.080 --> 17:44.356
Only Death shall love me.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.472
Not bad.

17:48.880 --> 17:52.111
The cockerels announce daybreak!

17:54.400 --> 17:56.709
I shall go home to bed.

18:00.520 --> 18:05.036
- And that's it.
- Author! Author!

18:06.360 --> 18:08.920
You were fantastic!

18:09.040 --> 18:12.350
- And you were excellent.
- It was all Linus's doing!

18:12.480 --> 18:16.189
- But I forgot my lines.
- That was nothing!

18:27.520 --> 18:30.637
Let's clear the table and wash up now.

18:30.760 --> 18:34.799
- I'll do it, it's too early to go to bed.
- Not on your life!

18:34.920 --> 18:38.833
I like pottering around,
you'd actually be doing me a service.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.236
- Well, in that case...
- That's settled, then.

18:42.360 --> 18:44.954
I'll get cracking straight away.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.594
- Are you going to bed now?
- Yes.

18:47.720 --> 18:51.395
- There's hot water in the kitchen.
- Oh good.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.992
- The thunderstorm has passed.
- I said that all along.

18:55.120 --> 19:00.035
We left the window open, we'll have
mosquitoes in the bedroom.

19:00.160 --> 19:03.755
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Karin.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.440
Good night, everybody!

19:06.880 --> 19:09.633
- Are you all right there?
- I'm fine.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.354
- I'll help you.
- I'm fine.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.914
Could you help me, please?

20:08.560 --> 20:11.711
They get this black
from your gardening.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.831
It won't go away.

20:15.360 --> 20:18.432
You have such kind fingers.

20:19.360 --> 20:22.158
But your thumb looks a little stubborn.

20:23.600 --> 20:27.036
- Are you sad, Karin?
- Not really.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.836
What are you thinking?

20:29.960 --> 20:32.793
Sometimes we're so defenceless.

20:33.520 --> 20:36.239
No, I don't know...

20:37.360 --> 20:41.512
Like children cast out
into the wilderness at night.

20:41.640 --> 20:45.918
The owls fly by, watching you
with their yellow eyes.

20:46.040 --> 20:50.272
You hear the pitter-patter and rustle,
soughing and sighing...

20:50.400 --> 20:53.517
All the moist muzzles...

20:54.200 --> 20:56.509
The teeth of the wolves...

20:56.640 --> 20:59.552
Not to worry, we'd have each other.

21:00.120 --> 21:04.875
- You look anxious, I'm not so sure...
- I'm not anxious at all.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.791
You say there are no wolves, I'm not
seeing any owls or hearing anything.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.593
"You're just imagining things."

21:13.720 --> 21:17.395
You have to trust me, Karin.
Little Kajsa.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.230
"Little Kajsa"...

21:20.360 --> 21:23.591
You always say that... "Little Kajsa."

21:24.960 --> 21:28.839
Am I so little, or has the illness
made a child of me?

21:28.960 --> 21:31.713
Do you think I'm strange?

21:35.120 --> 21:38.476
- Do you think I speak the truth?
- I don't know.

21:41.520 --> 21:44.796
- Don't you think I love you?
- Yes, I do.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.515
- Isn't that enough?
- Of course it's enough.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.428
- Leave it, or you'll start bleeding!
- I'll be all right.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.231
I have to do some washing tomorrow.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.112
Come to bed, Karin.

22:03.240 --> 22:07.119
Dad took Minus's play
as a personal insult.

22:07.240 --> 22:11.028
He was terribly hurt,
but tried not to let on.

22:11.160 --> 22:14.277
And Minus was upset, of course.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.233
Shall we put out the light?

22:29.280 --> 22:33.114
- I'm sorry if I upset you.
- Dearest child...

22:33.240 --> 22:36.710
- I'm sorry.
- Dearest beloved...

22:38.280 --> 22:40.669
My dear, dear girl...

22:41.520 --> 22:43.875
Sweetheart, I love you.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.473
You couldn't hurt me.

22:48.680 --> 22:51.478
You're so kind and I'm so mean.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.117
Good night.

24:28.640 --> 24:33.350
"She came towards him,
panting with anticipation" -

24:33.480 --> 24:36.278
- "cheeks rosy from the strong wind."

24:38.680 --> 24:40.477
My God...!

29:57.160 --> 30:00.516
"They met..."

30:01.320 --> 30:04.198
"...on the beach."

30:12.960 --> 30:17.397
Hello, little Kajsa. Are you up already?
It can't be more than four.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.629
- Hello, Daddy.
- What is it?

30:22.440 --> 30:25.159
Are you having problems?

30:25.280 --> 30:29.876
I'm adding the finishing touches
to my book, not my favourite pastime.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.151
- Read to me.
- Later, when I get the proofs.

30:34.680 --> 30:39.435
- How come you're not sleeping?
- Some birds made a scary noise.

30:39.560 --> 30:43.519
They woke me up, and then
I didn't dare go back to sleep.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.430
Here you are...

31:00.240 --> 31:04.756
- Just like when I was little.
- You will sleep now, you'll see.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.992
"They met on the beach."

31:27.120 --> 31:29.680
"It was a clear day."

31:29.800 --> 31:32.394
"Autumn was in the air."

31:33.440 --> 31:36.591
- Dad!
- Sh! Karin has just fallen asleep.

31:38.400 --> 31:42.632
- Want to come and pull in the nets?
- I'll be there.

32:10.080 --> 32:13.152
Last year I was as good at
walking on my hands as on my feet.

32:13.280 --> 32:17.193
- Now I'm so tall, I've lost all stability.
- Same here.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.311
Spiritually, you mean?

32:19.440 --> 32:21.829
- Do you write these days?
- Plays.

32:21.960 --> 32:24.076
- Can I read something?
- No.

32:24.200 --> 32:27.590
Nothing personal,
but they're not very good.

32:27.720 --> 32:32.635
- Have you written a lot?
- 13 plays and an opera this summer.

32:32.760 --> 32:36.275
It's gushing out of me.
Is that how it is for you too?

32:36.400 --> 32:38.152
No.

32:38.280 --> 32:41.272
What did you think of our play
last night?

32:41.400 --> 32:44.437
- It was nice.
- I think it was crap.

34:30.159 --> 34:33.311
"Her illness is incurable..."

34:34.639 --> 34:37.393
"...with temporary improvement."

34:38.880 --> 34:44.273
"I have long suspected it, the certainty
is none the less almost unbearable."

34:46.760 --> 34:50.469
"I'm horrified by my curiosity."

34:52.440 --> 34:55.591
"By my urge to record its course."

34:56.480 --> 35:01.429
"To make an accurate description
of her gradual disintegration."

35:03.400 --> 35:05.960
"To use her."

35:48.520 --> 35:52.069
Martin! Wake up!
How long are you going to sleep?

35:52.200 --> 35:55.112
Martin, time for a bath! Get up now!

35:55.240 --> 35:58.596
- What time is it?
- It's... almost ten.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.553
Heavens, have I slept that long?

36:06.160 --> 36:08.754
- You little imp! It's only five.
- So what?

36:08.880 --> 36:13.908
I've been up for ages and had such
odd experiences, while you just sleep.

36:14.040 --> 36:18.079
- Come over here.
- No, get up! We're going for a swim.

36:18.200 --> 36:21.590
- Dad and Minus are doing the nets.
- Come to me!

36:25.880 --> 36:30.874
You sleep too much, that's what
makes you such a know-all.

36:37.680 --> 36:40.353
My little one, what's wrong?

36:43.080 --> 36:45.310
Nothing...

36:45.440 --> 36:48.955
- What is it, Karin?
- I have a confession.

36:49.080 --> 36:51.514
So spit it out.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.314
When dad went out just now -

36:55.440 --> 36:58.637
- I rummaged through
his desk drawers.

36:58.760 --> 37:02.230
I don't know why, I just felt I had to.

37:02.360 --> 37:03.873
And?

37:05.560 --> 37:08.677
- I found his diary.
- And?

37:11.360 --> 37:14.397
- He'd written things there...
- Like what?

37:15.640 --> 37:18.234
About me.

37:18.360 --> 37:22.319
- What had he written?
- I can't tell you.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.629
About your illness?

37:27.920 --> 37:31.833
- Is it true it's incurable?
- Dearest Karin...

37:31.960 --> 37:34.838
Listen to me now!

37:34.960 --> 37:37.554
Listen... Look at me!

37:37.680 --> 37:39.875
Look at me...

37:40.000 --> 37:44.039
I told David that there is a chance
you'll have a relapse.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.594
Maybe he misunderstood me.

37:46.720 --> 37:50.269
No one could say
that your illness is incurable.

37:51.680 --> 37:54.478
- Word of honour?
- Word of honour!

37:56.440 --> 37:58.396
There now...

37:59.160 --> 38:01.230
There was more...

38:01.360 --> 38:04.193
- Well...?
- I can't tell you!

38:04.320 --> 38:08.029
- Please...
- I couldn't possibly!

38:08.160 --> 38:10.549
Ask him yourself!

38:12.840 --> 38:15.752
Karin... Little Karin...

38:15.880 --> 38:17.836
Martin?

38:20.480 --> 38:23.313
You have to be patient with me.

38:24.560 --> 38:27.552
I'm sure my desire will come back.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.830
- Don't you think?
- Oh yes!

38:29.960 --> 38:33.430
- Does it worry you?
- Not in the least.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.717
Listen... I'm terribly tired, but...

38:38.440 --> 38:41.910
I still think we should get up
and go for a swim.

38:42.040 --> 38:44.349
It's not cold at all.

38:53.560 --> 38:58.714
Imagine having a calm woman who
gave you children and coffee in bed.

38:58.840 --> 39:02.230
Who was big and soft
and warm and beautiful...

39:03.000 --> 39:05.878
Wouldn't that be nice after all?

39:06.000 --> 39:09.356
- It's you I love.
- Of course, but nevertheless.

39:09.480 --> 39:12.472
I don't want anyone else!

39:19.240 --> 39:24.678
Even though you always say and do
the right thing, it turns out wrong.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.230
I do it out of love.

39:29.360 --> 39:32.830
He that loves for real,
always does right by his loved one.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.838
In that case you don't love me.

39:45.320 --> 39:46.833
Bye, Minus!

39:47.560 --> 39:49.278
Bye!

40:04.840 --> 40:08.549
Make sure poor Minus
doesn't fall asleep on his Latin.

40:08.680 --> 40:12.798
- I said I'd test him on his grammar.
- Bye, my girl!

40:14.040 --> 40:17.715
Don't forget your brandy,
and get a bottle of white wine.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.274
- Bye, darling.
- We'll be back for dinner.

40:59.880 --> 41:02.678
What the hell are you laughing at?!

41:04.720 --> 41:06.358
Eh?

41:08.200 --> 41:10.589
Say something!

41:12.080 --> 41:14.958
Go ahead, if it's so amusing!

41:15.080 --> 41:17.469
Which are your favourites?

41:17.600 --> 41:21.513
Don't be an old maid,
come here and show me!

41:26.320 --> 41:30.154
- Do you like her best? Why?
- She's so soft.

41:30.280 --> 41:33.909
I think she's pretty too.
But isn't she a bit fat?

41:34.040 --> 41:38.397
- And her hair is so long...
- She doesn't look too complicated!

41:40.360 --> 41:43.432
But what good is that to me?

41:49.520 --> 41:52.193
Are you going to hit me?

41:56.560 --> 41:59.472
It's my fault. Forgive me.

41:59.600 --> 42:04.276
Calm down, Minus.
It doesn't matter, don't worry.

42:05.520 --> 42:08.717
It was foolish of me to pry.

42:10.040 --> 42:13.191
I don't want to, it just happens.

42:18.760 --> 42:23.197
- Do you want me to test you?
- If you feel like it...

42:26.400 --> 42:29.278
- I wonder if everyone is caged in?
- What?

42:29.400 --> 42:34.599
You in yours, I in mine.
Each in their cubicle... Everybody.

42:34.720 --> 42:39.316
- I don't feel caged in at all!
- I'm wrong, as usual.

42:39.440 --> 42:42.557
Constructio ad sensum.
What does that mean?

42:42.680 --> 42:43.954
Don't try...

42:44.080 --> 42:49.279
It means changing a grammatical
construct to suit the content.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.277
An example?

42:52.400 --> 42:56.393
Nobilitas rem publicam deseru...

42:56.520 --> 42:59.318
...deseruerant.

42:59.440 --> 43:02.876
- It's so hot!
- And I've been up since four thirty.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.753
Do you want to smoke a cigarette?

43:13.480 --> 43:18.759
If you look long enough with your
head tilted to one side it gets scary.

43:18.880 --> 43:20.996
Scary?

43:21.960 --> 43:24.235
Though tempting.

43:24.360 --> 43:28.956
I don't talk to dad or Martin about it,
they don't understand.

43:29.080 --> 43:34.359
Particularly not Martin, he's too
anxious and has enough as it is.

43:36.160 --> 43:40.073
They don't understand,
they only think I'm ill.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.839
- Do you think so too?
- No!

43:44.840 --> 43:47.070
I thought so.

43:51.120 --> 43:53.588
You're stronger.

43:53.720 --> 43:56.951
I've so often wanted to talk to you
about it all.

43:57.080 --> 43:59.514
You can trust me.

44:00.280 --> 44:04.478
It's hard not to talk about something
that's constantly on your mind.

44:04.600 --> 44:07.398
But I don't think they mind
my telling you.

44:07.520 --> 44:12.435
- "They"?
- Don't rush me with lots of questions.

44:12.560 --> 44:15.074
Either I tell you, or it's over.

44:15.200 --> 44:18.590
- It makes me curious.
- It's all right for you.

44:25.320 --> 44:27.390
Let me show you something.

45:08.640 --> 45:11.029
I walk through walls, you see.

45:11.160 --> 45:16.188
Early every morning I'm woken by
someone calling me in a firm voice.

45:17.360 --> 45:20.397
I rise and come to this room.

45:20.520 --> 45:25.116
One day someone called me
from behind the wallpaper.

45:27.440 --> 45:31.353
I looked in the closet,
but there was no one there.

45:33.320 --> 45:36.756
But the voice went on calling me -

45:36.880 --> 45:41.396
- so I pressed myself against the wall,
and it gave, like foliage -

45:41.520 --> 45:43.875
- and then I was inside.

45:47.520 --> 45:50.273
You think I'm making it up, don't you?

45:55.400 --> 45:58.073
I come into a big room.

45:59.480 --> 46:02.119
It's all light and peaceful.

46:03.640 --> 46:07.076
People are moving up and down.

46:07.200 --> 46:10.670
Some of them talk to me,
so I'll understand.

46:12.680 --> 46:15.638
It's so nice, and I'm safe.

46:16.960 --> 46:20.635
In some of the faces
there's like a shining light.

46:22.920 --> 46:25.832
Everyone is waiting for him to come -

46:25.960 --> 46:28.428
- but no one is anxious.

46:29.440 --> 46:33.433
They say that I can be there too
when it happens!

46:35.400 --> 46:37.516
Why are you crying?

46:38.880 --> 46:41.110
It's nothing.

46:41.560 --> 46:43.949
Nothing to worry about.

46:47.400 --> 46:51.757
But... sometimes I have this
intense yearning.

46:53.840 --> 46:56.798
I yearn for that moment...

46:57.760 --> 47:00.832
...when the door will open...

47:00.960 --> 47:05.909
- ...and all the faces will turn to him.
- Who is he?

47:11.520 --> 47:14.159
No one has said for certain.

47:16.360 --> 47:20.353
But I think it's God
who shall reveal himself to us.

47:22.720 --> 47:27.999
That it will be him coming into
the room, through that door.

47:37.360 --> 47:39.476
Minus...

47:42.000 --> 47:44.753
This isn't easy to say...

47:44.880 --> 47:47.872
- What's that?
- I turn away from Martin.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.436
He calls out after me,
but I can't help him.

47:51.560 --> 47:54.074
It becomes play-acting.

47:54.200 --> 47:57.749
- Does he notice anything?
- I'm not sure.

47:57.880 --> 48:00.838
I must choose between him
and the others.

48:00.960 --> 48:05.078
I've made up my mind...
I have sacrificed Martin.

48:06.480 --> 48:09.472
- Is all this for real?
- I don't know.

48:09.600 --> 48:14.196
I don't know! I'm caught in the middle,
and sometimes I'm uncertain.

48:14.320 --> 48:18.074
I know I've been ill
and that the illness was like a dream.

48:18.200 --> 48:23.194
But these are not dreams, they're real.
They have to be real!

48:23.320 --> 48:27.154
To me they're not real,
not in the least.

48:28.720 --> 48:30.711
Karin...

48:30.840 --> 48:33.593
- It's not real for me.
- Oh yes...!

48:39.040 --> 48:42.032
A god steps down from the mountain.

48:43.280 --> 48:46.875
He walks through the dark forest...

48:47.000 --> 48:51.391
Everywhere the wild beasts,
in the silence and the darkness.

48:54.240 --> 48:56.595
It has to be real.

48:57.160 --> 49:00.709
I'm not dreaming,
and I'm telling the truth.

49:00.840 --> 49:04.515
Now I'm in one world,
now in the other.

49:04.640 --> 49:07.279
I can't stop it!

49:17.480 --> 49:19.994
Shall we go for a swim?

49:22.480 --> 49:25.153
I'll go on my own then.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.959
I feel sleepy.

49:29.080 --> 49:32.038
I'm going to take a nap.

49:32.160 --> 49:34.754
Close the door when you leave.

49:43.720 --> 49:46.632
Don't do that! Get out! Get out!

50:00.720 --> 50:03.518
What the hell can I do?

50:15.120 --> 50:18.112
Well, have you prepared your Latin?

50:19.440 --> 50:22.034
Let's continue.

50:23.080 --> 50:25.071
First we'll have tea.

50:27.240 --> 50:28.832
Minus!

50:30.000 --> 50:34.391
- Will you tell dad and Martin?
- What would I tell them?

50:34.520 --> 50:39.640
Clever answer, but you can't fool me.
You'll take Martin to one side and say:

50:39.760 --> 50:43.753
"I have to talk to you about Karin."
And then you'll tell him everything.

50:43.880 --> 50:47.031
- Can't you tell him?
- Promise not to say anything!

50:47.160 --> 50:50.675
- I promise.
- No one but you understands.

50:50.800 --> 50:55.396
- One word, and you've betrayed me.
- I promise.

51:07.680 --> 51:10.592
- It looks like rain.
- Do you think so?

51:10.720 --> 51:13.280
- What's with you?
- What?

51:13.400 --> 51:16.039
You're so quiet, almost hostile.

51:16.160 --> 51:19.948
- It's not worth talking about it.
- Please!

51:20.080 --> 51:22.674
It's about Karin.

51:23.520 --> 51:27.559
She rummaged through your desk
and found your diary.

51:27.680 --> 51:30.956
- And she read it, of course.
- Oh no...

51:34.720 --> 51:37.075
What have you written?

51:38.080 --> 51:40.674
Karin wanted me to ask you.

51:43.920 --> 51:47.071
I wrote that her illness is incurable.

51:48.040 --> 51:51.715
And that I felt a strong urge
to record its course.

51:53.280 --> 51:57.717
I can't put the blame anywhere else.
There is no excuse.

51:58.640 --> 52:01.871
It's always about you and yours.

52:04.120 --> 52:07.112
Your callousness is perverse.

52:07.240 --> 52:10.596
"Record its course."
That's so typical...!

52:13.000 --> 52:17.312
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't.

52:17.440 --> 52:21.433
But one thing I do understand
- you're hunting for themes.

52:21.560 --> 52:26.031
Your own daughter's mental illness.
What a great bloody idea!

52:27.640 --> 52:30.234
- I love her, Martin.
- You "Iove"?

52:30.360 --> 52:35.195
There's no room for emotion in your
void. And you lack common decency.

52:35.320 --> 52:39.757
You know how to express yourself,
you always have the right words.

52:39.880 --> 52:45.398
There's only one phenomenon you
haven't the slightest clue about - Iife!

52:45.520 --> 52:47.988
You're a craven coward!

52:48.120 --> 52:53.035
But in one particular you're a genius:
evasions and excuses.

52:54.880 --> 52:58.668
- What do you want me to do?
- Write your book!

52:58.800 --> 53:03.476
It might give you your heart's desire:
your artistic breakthrough.

53:03.600 --> 53:07.070
Then you won't have sacrificed
your daughter in vain. And...

53:07.200 --> 53:10.237
Go ahead, say it!

53:19.400 --> 53:22.517
In your novels
you're always flirting with a god.

53:22.640 --> 53:28.397
Let me tell you: Your faith and
your doubt are very unconvincing.

53:28.520 --> 53:32.115
What is most conspicuous
is your inventiveness.

53:32.240 --> 53:35.949
- Don't you think I know that?
- Why do you go on?

53:36.080 --> 53:40.153
- Do something respectable instead.
- Such as?

53:40.280 --> 53:44.831
Have you written one word of truth
in your life as an author?

53:44.960 --> 53:47.394
- I don't know.
- See?

53:47.520 --> 53:51.798
Your half-lies are so refined
that they look like the truth.

53:51.920 --> 53:54.832
- I try.
- Maybe you do.

53:54.960 --> 53:57.679
But you never quite get there.

53:59.080 --> 54:01.036
I know.

54:02.880 --> 54:05.440
You're empty but capable.

54:05.560 --> 54:10.031
And now you're trying to fill your void
with Karin's extinction.

54:10.160 --> 54:16.076
But how will God fit into that? It must
make him more inscrutable than ever!

54:16.200 --> 54:21.069
Let me ask you something... Can you
control your innermost thoughts?

54:21.200 --> 54:24.749
Fortunately I'm not very complicated.

54:24.880 --> 54:29.192
My world is very simple.
Quite clear and human.

54:29.320 --> 54:33.154
- Still you've wished Karin would die?
- Absolutely not!

54:34.720 --> 54:37.029
Only you could think that.

54:37.160 --> 54:41.836
Can you swear that you've never
thought it? It would be logical...

54:41.960 --> 54:48.115
You know her case is hopeless. And
you know your suffering is pointless.

54:48.240 --> 54:51.391
- She might just as well be dead.
- You are grotesque.

54:51.520 --> 54:54.751
That depends entirely
on your point of view.

54:56.440 --> 54:59.034
I love her.

54:59.160 --> 55:01.310
I'm powerless.

55:02.040 --> 55:04.873
I can only stand and watch -

55:05.000 --> 55:09.198
- as she is transformed into
a poor, tormented creature.

55:12.040 --> 55:14.759
Let me tell you something.

55:17.520 --> 55:21.035
When I was in Switzerland
I decided to kill myself.

55:21.160 --> 55:24.232
I hired a car and found a precipice.

55:25.200 --> 55:30.558
I calmly set out. It was afternoon,
the valley was already in darkness.

55:32.520 --> 55:36.479
I was empty.
No fear, no regrets or expectations.

55:37.280 --> 55:42.354
I set out for the precipice, stepping on
the gas - and stalled, stopping dead.

55:42.480 --> 55:45.074
The gearbox went, you see.

55:45.200 --> 55:50.399
The car slid on the gravel and came
to a halt, front wheels over the edge.

55:50.520 --> 55:54.149
I crawled out of the car, trembling.

55:55.480 --> 55:58.995
I leaned against the rock face
across the road.

55:59.120 --> 56:02.237
I sat yawning for hours
from being short of breath.

56:04.640 --> 56:07.712
Why are you telling me this?

56:07.840 --> 56:11.992
I want to tell you that I no longer have
any front to protect.

56:12.120 --> 56:15.192
The truth won't bring a catastrophe.

56:15.320 --> 56:18.835
- This has nothing to do with Karin.
- I think it does.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.195
I don't understand that.

56:22.320 --> 56:27.269
Out of my void something was born,
something I can't touch or name.

56:30.200 --> 56:32.350
A love...

56:32.480 --> 56:34.835
...for Karin... and Minus.

56:36.800 --> 56:38.711
And you.

56:41.080 --> 56:43.913
One day I may tell you about it.

56:44.040 --> 56:47.032
I daren't do it now. But...

56:47.960 --> 56:51.589
If it is the way I'm hoping...

56:55.080 --> 56:57.196
Let's leave it for now.

57:16.400 --> 57:18.755
The rain is coming now.

57:20.600 --> 57:21.874
No.

57:24.720 --> 57:26.517
Yes...

57:27.560 --> 57:29.312
The rain's coming!

58:00.240 --> 58:02.151
Karin!

59:51.880 --> 59:54.440
Karin, is that you?

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.033
It's me, Karin.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.357
Can't you hear me, Karin?!

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.119
- I'm not well.
- Let's go home.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.233
- You have to help me.
- How can I help you?

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.155
You have to help me.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.317
- I'm so thirsty.
- I'll fetch some water.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.151
God.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.229
What time is it?

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.229
Five, I think.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.279
I've been very ill, but I feel better now.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.597
- Poor Minus!
- Karin, my darling...

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.996
- I want to talk to dad alone.
- Let's go home.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:47.069
I have to talk to dad,
before it starts all over again... Please!

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:59.350
I'll go to the farm
and call an ambulance.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:11.674
Please, go and get my medicine bag.
I'll have to give her an injection.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.435
- Dad...
- Yes?

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:27.998
I want to stay at the hospital now.
I don't want any more treatments.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.309
- Can I be spared if you tell them?
- I don't know.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.469
One can't live in two worlds.
One has to choose.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:43.071
I can't go on moving from one
to the other all the time.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.431
It can't go on.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.754
What?

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.792
- The hatred.
- What hatred?

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.353
I didn't do it of my own free will.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:15.353
A voice told me what to do.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:21.156
The voice told you to read my diary.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.869
It also told you
to tell Martin what you read.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:34.198
I've done worse than that.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.155
Much worse.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.879
I tried to resist,
but I couldn't get away.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.070
I was forced to do it.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.559
When was this?

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.595
Just now.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.516
Poor Minus!

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.912
I just don't understand!

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.954
Try to stay calm, Karin.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.351
And then the room
with the waiting people...

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:30.678
The good, light people
waiting for the door to open -

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.678
- for God to come to them.

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.833
But then the voices appear...

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.752
I have to do what the voices tell me.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.431
I can't make sense of it all.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.199
Is it really only my illness?

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.470
Dad...

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.515
It's so horrible to see one's own
confusion, and to understand it!

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:15.109
I want to apologise to you.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:21.313
I've always had a guilty conscience
about you, so I've turned away.

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:29.432
It makes me sick to think of all the life
I've sacrificed for my so-called art.

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:34.680
When your mother died, my making it
as a writer meant more to me.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:39.635
I was secretly rejoicing, yet I loved
your mother in my own confused way.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:42.274
When I fell ill you went to Switzerland.

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:46.473
I couldn't bear that you'd inherited
your mother's illness, so I fled.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.398
I had to finish my novel.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.908
Is it any good?

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.189
You see, Karin...

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.872
One draws a magic circle
around oneself -

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.198
- to keep everything out
that doesn't fit one's secret games.

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:13.348
Each time life breaks the circle, the
games become puny and ridiculous.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.475
So one draws a new circle
and builds new defences.

01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:24.834
Poor little dad.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.999
Poor little dad,
who has to live in the real world.

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:46.749
Let's go home now.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.348
I have to pack.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.552
- When will the ambulance be here?
- In about an hour.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.512
I just want to get changed and pack.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.679
I can manage on my own.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.634
The light is so strong.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:40.718
You must help Linus
with his Latin, Dad.

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:46.670
We mustn't forget to bring the keys
to the house.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:51.157
- Aren't you coming back here?
- No, I'll stay.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.669
I think that's best.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.518
We didn't get to pick any mushrooms.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.915
- Will you help me pack, Martin?
- Of course.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.796
Minus!

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.195
Minus, I want to talk to you!

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.949
Come here now, Minus!

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:33.750
Your shirts are clean, but not ironed.

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:41.119
- I'll wear this. I have shirts in town.
- Can you help me close this, please?

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:54.352
It's the shoes. I'll leave them here.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.631
Wear these instead and leave those.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.593
I'm taking them to the shoemaker's.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:05.034
Have you got a headache tablet?

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:10.038
- I thought I put my bag in here.
- No, it's in the kitchen.

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.310
So I did.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.554
- Have you seen Karin?
- No.

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.230
Yes, I understand.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.675
I understand.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:53.073
Yes... that's good.

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.074
Yes, I understand.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.514
Yes, I understand.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.518
I know it won't be long now.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.599
It's a great comfort to know.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:14.757
But our waiting has been one ofjoy.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:20.951
Sh, Martin! They're saying
he'll be here any moment now.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.196
We have to be ready.

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.995
- We're going to town.
- I can't go now, don't you see?

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.112
You're mistaken, Karin.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.598
Nothing is happening in there.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.839
Karin... No god
will walk through that door!

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:44.351
He'll be here any moment now,
I have to be here then!

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.438
Dearest Karin, it's not true!

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.950
If you can't be quiet you'd better leave!

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.593
Come now.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.952
Go away and let me have
this moment alone!

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:30.238
Martin, dearest...

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.158
I'm sorry I was so mean just now.

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:40.271
Couldn't you kneel down next to me
and clasp your hands?

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:45.633
It looks so funny and demonstrative
with you sitting on that chair.

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.752
I know you don't believe.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.474
But for my sake, Martin.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.431
Karin...

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.755
My love!

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.437
My love... my love!

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.395
Hold her legs.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.429
Calm down, Karin.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.589
I was frightened.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.395
The door opened...

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.433
...but the god was a spider.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:43.358
He came up to me...

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.789
...and I saw his face.

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.718
It was a terrible, stony face.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.476
He scrambled up
and tried to penetrate me -

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.989
- but I defended myself.

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:03.318
All along I saw his eyes.

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.755
They were cold and calm.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:12.197
When he couldn't penetrate me...

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:16.038
...he continued up my chest...

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.517
...up into my face and onto the wall.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.795
I have seen God.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.195
Wait by the jetty,
we'll be there as soon as we can.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:05.314
They'll be waiting by the jetty.

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.596
Dad...

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.435
I'm scared, Dad!

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:21.510
I sat in the wreck, holding Karin,
when reality cracked.

01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:24.757
- Do you understand what I mean?
- I understand.

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.555
Reality... cracked, and I fell out.

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.710
It's like in dreams...

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.115
Anything can happen.

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.151
Anything!

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.993
- I know.
- I can't live in this new world.

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:45.318
Yes, you can. But you have to have
something to hold on to.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.637
What would that be - a god?

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.154
Give me a proof of God!

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.156
- You can't.
- Yes, I can.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:00.511
But you have to listen carefully.

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:03.757
Yes... I need to listen.

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.759
I can only give you an indication
of my own hope.

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:12.192
It's knowing that love exists for real
in the human world.

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:15.357
- A special kind of love, I suppose?
- All kinds, Minus.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:20.031
The highest and the lowest, the most
ridiculous and the most sublime.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.037
All kinds.

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:26.073
- The longing for love?
- Longing and denial.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:29.237
Doubt and faith.

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:32.432
So love is the proof?

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:39.153
I don't know whether love is proof of
God's existence, or if love is God.

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:43.795
For you, love and God are the same?

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:49.277
I rest my emptiness and dirty
hopelessness in that thought.

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.629
Tell me more, Dad!

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:55.558
Suddenly the emptiness
turns into abundance -

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.069
- and hopelessness into life.

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:01.431
It's like a reprieve, Minus...

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.074
...from a sentence of death.

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:07.678
Dad... if it is as you say -

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:13.033
- then Karin is surrounded by God,
since we love her.

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.594
Could that help her?

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.676
I believe so.

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.672
Dad?

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:28.351
- Would you mind if I go for a run?
- Run off. I'll make dinner.

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:30.994
See you in an hour.

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:40.473
Dad talked to me.
