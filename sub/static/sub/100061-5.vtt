the holiday of Famadihana.

08:02.307 --> 08:05.136

would open up their crypts

08:05.180 --> 08:07.704

to rewrap the remains

in new cloth.

an opportunity.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.325

a homicide investigation.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.590

hate to break it to you,

on scene tonight.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.680
Oh-- Well, of course.

08:26.723 --> 08:29.509
I'm just here in a purely
observational capacity.

08:29.552 --> 08:32.250
Oh, well, if you're just here to
observe, you picked a good one.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.557
Right this way, folks.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.994
Our vic is Edith Lahela.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.692
Edith took a gunshot
wound to the chest

08:38.735 --> 08:40.041
about an hour ago.

08:40.084 --> 08:42.609
She was discovered by
some trick-or-treaters.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.567

was wide open.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.177

called it in.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.049

they were expecting, I'm sure.

story's just getting started.

Or what's left of him, anyway.

08:56.927 --> 09:01.018
Cordite residue on his hand
confirms he shot Edith Lahela.

Here he was, at it again.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.200
He must have seen this door,

09:09.244 --> 09:11.072

a vault down here.

09:11.115 --> 09:12.160

09:12.203 --> 09:13.640
Not exactly.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.992
QUINN:
Well, isn't
this charming?

09:18.819 --> 09:20.255
Someone was living in here.

09:20.298 --> 09:22.083
Someone with a
pretty bad temper.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.998
Hold on. So...

09:24.041 --> 09:26.783
[chuckling]:
Little old Edith
from upstairs,

09:26.827 --> 09:29.046
she was keeping someone
locked in this room?

09:29.090 --> 09:31.658
And then our perp comes in
thinking that he landed

09:31.701 --> 09:33.616
some big score,
and gets killed

09:33.660 --> 09:35.618
by whoever is
being trapped in here?

09:35.662 --> 09:36.619
GROVER:
What can I say?

09:36.663 --> 09:38.665
I told you it was a good one.

09:38.708 --> 09:39.796

Fascinating.

20:29.184 --> 20:32.622
But did you hear
any speculation?

20:32.666 --> 20:36.017
I think some sisters
face a daily struggle

20:36.060 --> 20:38.149
with their faith

20:38.193 --> 20:40.978
and their vows.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.677
And some make mistakes.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.637
DECOSTA:
Sister Laureta,

20:47.681 --> 20:49.509
it's time for Compline.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.163
I'm sorry. I have to go.

20:55.689 --> 20:57.865
Brother. That was
a complete bust.

20:57.908 --> 21:00.171
Come on.

21:00.215 --> 21:02.478
Sister Chatty Cathy could not
have been more obvious.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.480
Edith left
because she was pregnant.

21:05.525 --> 21:07.483
All right, fine.

21:07.527 --> 21:08.702
You might have a point

21:08.745 --> 21:10.486
about the pregnancy.
Uh-huh.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.835
But come on.

21:11.879 --> 21:14.011
There's no Rosemary's Baby
situation

21:14.055 --> 21:17.276
going on here.

21:17.319 --> 21:20.279
Here's what is probably
the closest thing to the truth.

21:20.322 --> 21:23.543
Edith was exiled because
she conceived a child.

21:23.586 --> 21:26.285
And then she punished
the child

21:26.328 --> 21:27.808
for its entire life
because of it.

21:27.851 --> 21:29.331
Well, that's grim.

21:29.375 --> 21:30.637
Hey...[cell phone ringing]

21:30.680 --> 21:33.335
no horror movie in the world
any match for life.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.772
Hey, Q, what's up?

21:35.816 --> 21:36.904
Q?

21:36.947 --> 21:38.340
Yeah, sorry.
I regretted that

21:38.384 --> 21:39.602
as it was coming out
of my mouth.

21:39.646 --> 21:40.821
Do you have something for us?QUINN: Yeah.

21:40.864 --> 21:43.084
HPD located our
dead thief's accomplice.

21:43.127 --> 21:45.260
He turned up in the ER after
being hit by a car.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.349
Well, did he leave
a description of the killer?

21:47.393 --> 21:49.830
Nope, and I don't think that's
coming anytime soon either,

21:49.873 --> 21:51.266
because the doctors put him
on a psych hold.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.702
Apparently,
he wouldn't stop screaming

21:52.746 --> 21:55.401
about being chased through
the woods by a demon.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.753
DUKE: Lana Nakua attended
a fraternity party

21:59.796 --> 22:01.537
the night that she disappeared.

22:01.581 --> 22:02.582
Several people saw her
leave on her own

22:02.625 --> 22:04.584
around 11:00 p.m.

22:04.627 --> 22:05.933
She never made it home.

22:05.976 --> 22:08.892
How many people were
at this party?About 35.

22:08.936 --> 22:09.980
We interviewed all of them,

22:10.024 --> 22:11.286
got written statements
from everyone

22:11.330 --> 22:12.766
You like anybody for it?

22:12.809 --> 22:14.550
DUKE: Not that
we could charge

22:14.594 --> 22:17.379
without a body or
any physical evidence.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.381
I'll take that
as a yes, then, Duke.

22:19.425 --> 22:22.123
The point is, I spent a lot
of late nights going through

22:22.166 --> 22:23.559
all these statements,
and I always came back

22:23.603 --> 22:24.908
to the same three kids.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.043
Todd Hughes.

22:30.436 --> 22:34.309
Remy Mitchell.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.138
Zach Wyatt.

22:37.181 --> 22:40.228
They were all members of the
fraternity throwing the party.

22:40.271 --> 22:41.708
All from the mainland.

22:41.751 --> 22:44.580
Rich kids who reeked
of entitlement.

22:44.624 --> 22:47.844
Several students saw them
talking to Lana that night.

22:47.888 --> 22:50.456
Reports were interest
wasn't mutual.

22:50.499 --> 22:54.808
STEVE: And you say Lana left
the party at, uh, 11:00?Yeah.

22:54.851 --> 22:55.939
What about these three guys?

22:55.983 --> 22:57.419
Were they still there
when she left?

22:57.463 --> 22:59.987
Yeah, but they left about
30 minutes after she did.

23:00.030 --> 23:03.251
The trouble is,
they have alibis.

23:03.294 --> 23:05.688
Two people came forward
and gave written statements

23:05.732 --> 23:08.822
vouching for their whereabouts
for the rest of the night.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.085
Any of these kids
on the sailing team?

23:11.128 --> 23:12.608
I think so. Why?

23:12.652 --> 23:14.610
Look at this rope
around Lana's hands.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.656
That, my friend, is called
a double constrictor.

23:16.699 --> 23:19.441
It's a nautical knot.

23:19.485 --> 23:22.444
You said these guys went
to Oahu State, right?Yeah.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.185
All right, here's a photo
of the Oahu State

23:24.228 --> 23:25.926
2019 sailing team.

23:25.969 --> 23:28.755
Look who's in
the front row.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.365
Todd Hughes.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.020
Todd Hughes, Five-O, open up.
We need to talk to you.

23:45.815 --> 23:46.947
Bedroom's clear.

23:46.990 --> 23:49.079
Yo.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.693
This just happened.
That blood's still pooling.

23:53.736 --> 23:54.781
Looks like he was trying
to spell something

23:54.824 --> 23:56.043
with his fingers.

23:56.086 --> 23:57.784
"LN."

23:57.827 --> 24:00.047
It's gotta be our missing
cold case vic.

24:00.090 --> 24:01.396
Lana Nakua.

24:06.706 --> 24:08.925
[camera shutter clicking]

24:10.405 --> 24:12.451
JUNIOR:
Why would this guy's

24:12.494 --> 24:14.496
dying act be
to write Lana's initials?

24:14.540 --> 24:16.280
I have no idea.

24:16.324 --> 24:19.936
Hey, guys, I just found this
on Todd's body.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.460
Long and brunette,
just like Lana's.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.766
If that hair does belong
to Lana Nakua,

24:23.810 --> 24:26.334
then it's highly possible
that Todd was at the morgue.

24:26.377 --> 24:27.857
He took her body tonight.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.293
Maybe with help
from his friends.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.599
JUNIOR:
Well, it makes sense,

24:30.643 --> 24:31.948
but it still doesn't explain

24:31.992 --> 24:33.384
why he wrote
Lana's initials.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.865
Actually, he didn't.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.780
He couldn't have.

24:37.824 --> 24:39.303
COD was blunt force trauma,

24:39.347 --> 24:41.218
and the location of the blow
to the skull

24:41.262 --> 24:43.264
means that he would have
died instantly.

24:43.307 --> 24:45.527
Look, whoever did this
is making a statement,

24:45.571 --> 24:48.051
saying this was killed
for the role that he played

24:48.095 --> 24:49.444
in Lana's murder.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.707
Yeah. I guess Duke's
not the only one who thought

24:51.751 --> 24:53.013
this guy was involved.

24:55.015 --> 24:56.538
TUNDE:
What if they say "trick"?

24:56.582 --> 24:58.061
They won't.

24:58.105 --> 24:59.802
What if they do?

24:59.846 --> 25:03.632
Well, Tunde, what kind
of tricks can you do?

25:03.676 --> 25:07.027
Uh, I can solve most
acrostic puzzles

25:07.070 --> 25:08.898
in under three minutes.Okay.

25:08.942 --> 25:11.074
So if they say trick, we'll...

25:11.118 --> 25:12.554
move on and go
to the next house.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.470
[cell phone ringing]Oh.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.821
Give me a sec, lil' T.
What's up, cuz?

25:18.865 --> 25:23.260
Hey, your guests will eat
all the haupia

25:23.304 --> 25:24.566
and the rice pudding.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.437
I need you to go
to the market.

25:26.481 --> 25:27.656
I'm gonna text you a list.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.702
Ma, get Kamekona to help out.

25:29.745 --> 25:32.574
Eh, he has a bad back.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.663
My sciatica acting up.

25:34.707 --> 25:37.753
Hey, John Wick.
Nice costume.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.494
You, too.
BOY:
Wanna hang?

25:39.538 --> 25:41.583
Ma, I gotta go.
I'll be back soon.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.933
Don't you dare come back
without the food

25:43.977 --> 25:45.587
and a better attitude.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.067
[phone beeps off][sighs]

25:47.110 --> 25:49.460
Tunde?

25:49.504 --> 25:52.289
Tun-- Tunde!

25:52.333 --> 25:55.075
[groaning softly]

25:55.118 --> 25:57.294
Tunde!

26:00.733 --> 26:02.778
Got an open door.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.139
[phone rings]

26:16.183 --> 26:18.185
Junior, you find Remy Mitchell?

26:18.228 --> 26:19.752
Yep. But someone got
to him first.

26:19.795 --> 26:21.623
And by the looks of it,
I'm thinking we're dealing

26:21.667 --> 26:22.972
with the same killer
who took out Todd.

26:23.016 --> 26:24.670
You find Lana's initials
in blood?

26:24.713 --> 26:26.846
Yeah, except this time he didn't
just stop with the floor.

26:26.889 --> 26:29.109
It's all over the place.

26:29.152 --> 26:31.024
What about the vic?

26:31.067 --> 26:33.679
Our victim's hands and feet
are bound up just like Lana's.

26:33.722 --> 26:36.638
So Todd Hughes was beaten,
Remy Mitchell was tied up.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.989
Clearly, the killer is mirroring
the murder of Lana.

26:40.033 --> 26:43.514
Were you able to track down
our third suspect, Zach Wyatt?

26:43.558 --> 26:44.646
No, he wasn't at his place.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.169
But we better find him soon,

26:46.213 --> 26:48.694
before this killer finishes
his performance art piece

26:48.737 --> 26:49.869
and drowns the guy.

26:49.912 --> 26:51.392
TANI:
Homeowners

26:51.435 --> 26:53.829
that were at a Halloween party
called the cops

26:53.873 --> 26:56.266
after they saw something strange
on their security cam.

26:56.310 --> 26:59.356
QUINN: Doesn't look like
your run-of-the-mill
trick-or-treater.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.271
No. Almost looks like
he was casing that house.

27:01.315 --> 27:02.621
Yeah, maybe it's our guy.

27:02.664 --> 27:03.752
Maybe he's trying
to find a place to lay low.

27:03.796 --> 27:05.624
Maybe he's found one.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.190
All right, Tani, you and Quinn

27:07.234 --> 27:09.018
go check that out.[phone ringing]

27:09.062 --> 27:11.368
What up, Max?

27:11.412 --> 27:14.850
Captain, I have an update
on Edith Lahela's autopsy.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.678
I checked in
with the medical examiner,

27:16.722 --> 27:18.593
and while I would normally
advise waiting

27:18.637 --> 27:20.551
for the procedure to be complete
before divulging

27:20.595 --> 27:22.031
any information... but in short,

27:22.075 --> 27:23.598
I felt this was
sufficiently urgent

27:23.642 --> 27:25.556
that I decided
to break my own rules.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.862
All right, give us
the breaking news.

27:26.906 --> 27:28.472
It appears that Edith

27:28.516 --> 27:30.431
underwent an hysterectomy
at some time.

27:30.474 --> 27:31.737
Do we know when?

27:31.780 --> 27:33.434
Can't say for sure,

27:33.477 --> 27:35.871
but based on an examination
of the pelvic bone,

27:35.915 --> 27:37.873
Edith was never pregnant.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.092
Okay, so i-if the guy

27:39.135 --> 27:40.528
in her vault wasn't
her son, who was he?

27:40.571 --> 27:42.182
That I can't help you with.

27:42.225 --> 27:44.184
The DNA from the vault
returned no matches.

27:44.227 --> 27:47.404
However, I can say for sure
that we're dealing with a human,

27:47.448 --> 27:50.538
which is why I'm testing the DNA
for genetic mutations

27:50.581 --> 27:53.019
which could account
for atypical appearances.

27:53.062 --> 27:54.760
Okay, but that still doesn't
explain why Edith

27:54.803 --> 27:56.457
kept the poor guy
locked in a vault.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.980
I mean, just because
the guy looked different

27:58.024 --> 28:00.026
doesn't mean he was dangerous.Yeah, maybe not.

28:00.069 --> 28:03.682
But after 30 years in solitary,
oh, he is now.

28:19.828 --> 28:21.569
TANI:
Guess he was
looking for food.

28:22.613 --> 28:23.876
Well, I doubt he found much.

28:23.919 --> 28:25.486
Owners must be out of town.

28:25.529 --> 28:27.836
Cool, so the guy
who makes mincemeat

28:27.880 --> 28:29.316
out of humans is hangry.

28:29.359 --> 28:31.579
[glass shatters]

28:56.604 --> 28:58.824
[growls][grunts]

28:58.867 --> 29:00.739
Quinn!

29:04.307 --> 29:05.744
[wails]

29:11.314 --> 29:12.794
HPD's got all available
units out right now

29:12.838 --> 29:13.795
looking for the guy.

29:13.839 --> 29:14.927
And thanks to Tani,

29:14.970 --> 29:16.363
we now have a blood trail
we can follow.

29:16.406 --> 29:17.712
Did you get
a good look at him?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.714
Yeah. Caucasian,
well over six feet tall.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.717
I mean, he was big,
but he was also...

29:22.761 --> 29:24.110
asymmetrical.

29:24.153 --> 29:25.720
It was like things had grown
at different rates.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.375
And his eyes. I remember his
eyes were two different colors.

29:28.418 --> 29:30.986
MAX:
Heterochromia.

29:31.030 --> 29:33.467
Interesting. The description
of the man's physique

29:33.510 --> 29:35.643
fits with random-occurring
genetic mutations.

29:35.686 --> 29:39.386
However, the traits of having
two different-colored eyes

29:39.429 --> 29:41.780
is commonly a trait that's
inherited from one's parents.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.694
Inherited?

29:43.738 --> 29:44.826
Where have we seen someone

29:44.870 --> 29:47.481
with two different-colored eyes
before?

29:50.179 --> 29:52.442
GROVER:
Mother Superior Decosta.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.836
Here's what we know:

29:54.880 --> 29:56.838
after Sister Edith
left the convent,

29:56.882 --> 30:00.059
she raised a child in her home.

30:00.102 --> 30:02.017
And after locking him away

30:02.061 --> 30:05.107
in an eight-by-ten foot
cell for 30 years,

30:05.151 --> 30:09.242
that child escaped and now,
he's a danger to the public.

30:09.285 --> 30:13.768
I'm not sure why you think
I have anything to do with this.

30:16.684 --> 30:20.993
Because the kid had
mismatched eyes,

30:21.036 --> 30:25.780
something he would have
inherited from a parent.

30:27.608 --> 30:29.523
Sister Edith didn't
get pregnant.

30:29.566 --> 30:32.178
She couldn't. She'd
had a hysterectomy.

30:32.221 --> 30:33.701
But you did.

30:33.744 --> 30:35.921
Sister Edith left
that convent

30:35.964 --> 30:38.053
to raise your boy.

30:38.097 --> 30:40.099
And why did Edith
take that baby?

30:40.142 --> 30:44.277
Because she knew she'd never be
able to have a child of her own?

30:44.320 --> 30:45.713
No.

30:45.756 --> 30:48.194
She took that child
because she couldn't stomach

30:48.237 --> 30:51.197
abandoning an innocent baby.

30:55.941 --> 30:58.465
I made a terrible mistake.

31:00.423 --> 31:02.382
That child was conceived in sin

31:02.425 --> 31:06.081
and we have both paid
for my transgression.

31:09.432 --> 31:12.087
Edith was the only one who knew.

31:13.610 --> 31:17.527
I told her to take
the baby to a hospital...

31:19.312 --> 31:22.489
...but she decided to keep it.

31:22.532 --> 31:24.926
To love it.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.536
And I hated her for that,

31:26.580 --> 31:30.801
because I wanted to feel
that love in me.

31:30.845 --> 31:32.803
And you never saw
your son again?

31:32.847 --> 31:35.067
I visited Edith
a few times

31:35.110 --> 31:37.939
when the child was eight.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.942
She'd named him Kimo.

31:40.986 --> 31:43.118
When I met him,

31:43.162 --> 31:47.470
he pointed at my eyes.

31:47.514 --> 31:52.562
Covered his brown eye with one
hand and mine with the other.

31:52.606 --> 31:56.610
"Two blue eyes," he said.

31:56.653 --> 31:59.221
He seemed happy.

31:59.265 --> 32:01.310
MAX:
Because he
was happy.

32:01.354 --> 32:04.531
His-his appearance is a
byproduct of a genetic condition

32:04.574 --> 32:08.317
that causes overgrowth
in bones and tissue.

32:08.361 --> 32:11.538
He wasn't cursed.
He just looked different.

32:11.581 --> 32:15.368
GROVER:
In other words, he was
a kid who had enough problems

32:15.411 --> 32:18.240
without being locked away
for his entire life.

32:18.284 --> 32:19.415
DECOSTA:
Edith told me

32:19.459 --> 32:20.677
she'd tried taking him

32:20.721 --> 32:23.202
to get help one day,
but-but the outside

32:23.245 --> 32:26.248
can be cruel to someone
who looks like that.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.992
It broke her heart.

32:31.036 --> 32:33.299
It broke mine to hear it.

32:33.342 --> 32:34.953
MAX:
Edith didn't keep
Kimo inside

32:34.996 --> 32:36.432
because he was dangerous.

32:36.476 --> 32:39.218
She was trying to protecting him
from the outside world

32:39.261 --> 32:40.610
that would've hurt him.

32:40.654 --> 32:42.351
She did her best.

32:42.395 --> 32:43.962
And you did nothing.

32:44.005 --> 32:46.486
GROVER:
Well, you got a chance now
to make up for it.

32:46.529 --> 32:47.661
We need your help,

32:47.704 --> 32:50.490
Mother Superior.

32:50.533 --> 32:56.235
Your child, your son,
needs your help.

32:56.278 --> 32:58.237
Look, he's just lost
the only person

32:58.280 --> 33:01.240
in his entire life
who ever cared about him.

33:01.283 --> 33:03.242
I can't.

33:03.285 --> 33:05.635
I can't bear to face him.

33:05.679 --> 33:09.030
You abandoned him once.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.379
Don't do it again.

33:12.468 --> 33:14.731
STEVE: Hey.JUNIOR: Hey. APB is out

33:14.775 --> 33:16.733
on Zach Wyatt. I spoke
to some of his frat buddies.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.213
No one seems
to know where he is.

33:18.257 --> 33:20.085
Well, his phone's turned off,
too. HPD's monitoring

33:20.128 --> 33:22.783
his credit card activities,
but so far, nothing new.

33:22.826 --> 33:25.046
Maybe we're too late.
Maybe Zach's already dead.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.961
I don't know, man. I mean,
the killer wanted us

33:27.005 --> 33:29.529
to find those other two
bodies, clearly, right?

33:29.572 --> 33:31.922
So if Zach was killed, chances
are we'd know about it by now?

33:31.966 --> 33:34.403
Maybe he found out
his other buddies are dead,

33:34.447 --> 33:35.926
and now he's on the run.

33:35.970 --> 33:39.060
Or maybe he's not on the run
from this killer

33:39.104 --> 33:40.757
because he is
the killer.

33:40.801 --> 33:43.934
What if Zach
convinces his friends

33:43.978 --> 33:46.763
to help him steal Lana's body
from the morgue, right,

33:46.807 --> 33:49.201
to cover up a murder
that they were all a part of.

33:49.244 --> 33:52.291
Then he kills them, eliminating
any possibility of them

33:52.334 --> 33:53.944
ever rolling on him if caught.

33:53.988 --> 33:55.946
And he writes her initials
at the crime scene,

33:55.990 --> 33:57.470
makes it look
like a revenge killing,

33:57.513 --> 33:58.993
takes the heat off of himself.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.560
JUNIOR:
Then all he needs to do
is dispose

34:00.603 --> 34:03.258
of her body once and for all.

Yo.

Prelim DNA results

34:32.374 --> 34:34.637
that Noelani found
on Todd Hughes's body.

34:34.681 --> 34:36.161
Was it a match to Lana Nakua?

34:36.204 --> 34:37.814
See, that's the
thing, it wasn't.

34:37.858 --> 34:40.904
But it was a familial match.
DNA was female.

34:40.948 --> 34:43.255
Jump into the DMV database,
pull up her mother first.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.389
This is Lana's mom.
Well, it can't be her.

34:47.433 --> 34:49.087
Look, her hair's
a different color.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.218
Noelani said she had a sister.

34:50.262 --> 34:51.698
Check her.
