00:02.044 --> 00:04.797
<i>A few times a year,
there was a dedicated day</i>

00:05.006 --> 00:06.841
<i>where my school was closed.</i>

00:07.008 --> 00:08.926
<i>This allowed
the teachers to catch up</i>

00:09.093 --> 00:10.803
<i>on their administrative duties.</i>

00:11.012 --> 00:13.556
<i>While I was normally against
a break from learning,</i>

00:13.723 --> 00:16.517
<i>I did applaud the Medford
faculty's commitment</i>

00:16.684 --> 00:18.561
<i>- to our education.</i>
- Oh, man.

00:18.728 --> 00:21.689
- How great is this place without kids in it?
- I heard that.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.275
<i>On one of those
days, I got to spend time</i>

00:24.442 --> 00:25.693
<i>with my mom at herjob.</i>

00:25.860 --> 00:26.861
Did you write that?

00:27.028 --> 00:29.030
- You betcha.
- Instead of puns,

00:29.196 --> 00:31.866
have you considered composing
a humorous palindrome?

00:32.366 --> 00:35.036
It's a phrase that reads
the same backwards as forwards.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.747
For example,
"Do geese see God?"

00:39.415 --> 00:41.000
Trust me. Both ways.

00:42.293 --> 00:43.294
Come inside.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.922
Some other good ones
are radar, level, kayak.

00:47.173 --> 00:48.799
That's a funny word. Kayak.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.176
Never get me in one.

00:51.761 --> 00:52.803
So what's the plan?

00:53.054 --> 00:54.374
How will I be entertained
all day?

00:54.638 --> 00:56.515
I thought you could be
my little helper.

00:56.932 --> 00:59.518
I prefer executive assistant.
Carries more weight.

00:59.935 --> 01:02.855
Fine. You stay here.
I'm gonna go talk to Pastor Jeff.

01:03.773 --> 01:05.274
- Mom.
- What?

01:05.357 --> 01:08.069
"Mom" is also
a palindrome. M-O-M.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.824
Good morning, Peg.

01:13.991 --> 01:17.078
Any morning you wake up
is a good morning.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.578
Okay.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.458
Come in.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.960
Good morn...
oh, it's dark in here.

01:25.294 --> 01:26.545
Uh-huh.

01:27.505 --> 01:28.589
Everything okay?

01:29.423 --> 01:30.466
Mm-hmm.

01:31.509 --> 01:33.302
I need you to use your words.

01:35.513 --> 01:37.223
My marriage is over.

01:37.765 --> 01:38.849
Mm-hmm...

01:39.016 --> 01:42.269
<i>♪♪ Vaya con Dios ♪♪</i>

01:42.478 --> 01:44.313
<i>♪♪ My darling... ♪♪</i>

01:45.022 --> 01:47.733
<i>♪♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪♪</i>

01:47.900 --> 01:50.611
<i>♪♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪♪</i>

01:50.778 --> 01:53.155
<i>♪♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪♪</i>

01:53.489 --> 01:56.242
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

01:56.408 --> 01:59.745
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

02:02.164 --> 02:04.250
We don't even sleep
in the same bed anymore.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.962
In the '50s,
people had separate beds.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.673
Lucy and Ricky did it.
Their marriage worked.

02:13.092 --> 02:15.094
I... I'm sure
it's just a rough patch.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.429
Boy, I hope so.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.391
Well, if there's any way
I can make your life easier,

02:20.558 --> 02:21.559
you let me know.

02:22.268 --> 02:24.520
Thank you, Mary.
I really appreciate it.

02:26.522 --> 02:30.025
Oh, I almost forgot, um,
Sheldon's here with me today.

02:30.609 --> 02:31.735
Great.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.545
Hey, little man.
How you doing?

02:50.171 --> 02:51.547
You smell like cigarettes.

02:52.214 --> 02:53.299
You're fun.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.092
Do you know what this binder is?

02:55.801 --> 02:59.096
It's a record of donations
people make to the church.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.015
This data could
easily be transferred

03:01.182 --> 03:02.474
into a computerized spreadsheet.

03:02.641 --> 03:03.642
Why isn't it?

03:03.851 --> 03:04.852
No idea.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.230
You also smell
like mothballs and Ben-Gay.

03:10.274 --> 03:11.275
Bye.

03:14.904 --> 03:17.615
I hope you don't mind,
I invited Pastor Jeff for dinner.

03:17.865 --> 03:18.908
That's fine.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.367
I was talking to your father.

03:20.576 --> 03:21.619
What's the occasion?

03:22.244 --> 03:24.663
No occasion,
just thought it'd be nice.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.081
His wife coming, too?

03:26.749 --> 03:27.917
No. Just him.

03:28.334 --> 03:29.334
They having problems?

03:29.376 --> 03:31.170
He's just coming to dinner.
That's all.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.838
You two having problems?

03:33.422 --> 03:34.924
- Are we?
- No.

03:35.633 --> 03:38.260
Pastor Jeff's wife
is so much prettier than him.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.054
It's like Barbie
married a turtle.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.723
Hey. Here's a fun idea:

03:42.890 --> 03:44.350
How about you and Sheldon
have dinner

03:44.516 --> 03:46.435
- at Meemaw's tonight?
- All right.

03:47.519 --> 03:48.854
They are a
weird-looking couple.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.439
You want to eat
at my mom's, too?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.608
Oh, come on. You got eyes.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.240
Pastor, would you like
to lead us in grace?

03:59.615 --> 04:00.699
I'd be honored.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.870
Heavenly Father,
thank you for this food.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.998
I pray that it nourishes
and strengthens us,

04:08.165 --> 04:10.292
and bless Mary for preparing it.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.461
And thank you
for the Coopers

04:12.836 --> 04:16.382
who have invited me
into their loving home.

04:17.173 --> 04:20.094
They are
a shining example

04:20.344 --> 04:22.763
of what a marriage can be.

04:23.347 --> 04:27.476
One that I hope
to have again someday.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.479
- Amen.
- And please give me the strength...

04:30.646 --> 04:31.689
Sorry.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.941
The strength to walk this road

04:34.108 --> 04:38.445
with unconditional love
and joy in my heart.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.947
Amen.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.073
- Amen.
- Amen.

04:44.285 --> 04:45.828
Well, let's eat!

04:48.205 --> 04:50.291
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.126
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

04:53.252 --> 04:55.004
Dang, this place is nice.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.756
That's because it was
supposed to be a date.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.675
Cool. My first date.

05:00.009 --> 05:02.052
Meemaw, I've been going through
the church records,

05:02.219 --> 05:04.763
and I noticed you haven't made
a donation in quite a long time.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.099
Why are you going
through the records?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.018
I'm an executive assistant.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.769
- Good for you.
- You see,

05:10.936 --> 05:13.480
God and I have a deal.
And when he helps me win big

05:13.731 --> 05:15.649
at the casino,
I give him a cut.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.318
And lately, he has
not been holding up

05:17.401 --> 05:18.652
his part of the bargain.

05:19.361 --> 05:22.740
"Steak <i>aw poyver</i> with <i>fritties"?</i>

05:22.906 --> 05:24.408
- It's French.
- Oh.

05:24.742 --> 05:25.826
What's a crock monster?

05:26.201 --> 05:27.661
It's a <i>croque monsieur,</i>

05:27.828 --> 05:31.540
and it's really just a grilled
cheese sandwich with ham.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.292
I want that.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.211
There's lemon in this water.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.848
So, uh, who do you
think the Oilers

05:48.015 --> 05:49.141
are gonna take in the draft?

05:49.558 --> 05:51.518
Oh, I don't
really follow sports.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.396
I'm just gonna eat.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.486
What's he doing here?
Y'all getting a divorce?

06:01.111 --> 06:03.280
No. No, he's just
here for dinner.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.700
Oh. Welcome, Your Holiness.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.079
I thought you were hanging
out with Veronica tonight.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.708
We were supposed to,
but then she invited a bunch

06:12.790 --> 06:14.291
of her choir friends over,

06:14.458 --> 06:16.460
and it turned
into a stupid Bible study.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.670
- No offense.
- None taken.

06:19.088 --> 06:20.089
- Hmm.
- Honestly,

06:20.172 --> 06:22.049
I do not understand
the female mind.

06:22.633 --> 06:23.634
Do something.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.345
Georgie, why don't you go eat
dinner in front of the TV?

06:26.720 --> 06:29.390
No, it's all right. Sounds like
Georgie's having trouble

06:29.556 --> 06:31.183
navigating the perilous waters

06:31.350 --> 06:32.643
of a relationship.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.937
Believe me, I can understand.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.398
You having problems
with your hot wife?

06:40.359 --> 06:42.277
Maybe I'll go eat by the TV.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.575
I'm liking my crock monster.

06:48.826 --> 06:50.077
Mmm. Me, too.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.413
I can't taste anything
after the lemon water.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.915
I'm glad y'all
are having a good time.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.083
You're welcome.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.477
Where are we having
dinner tomorrow?

06:57.501 --> 06:58.669
Nowhere.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.922
Dr. Sturgis and I are going to
Louisiana, do a little gambling.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.383
So a donation could
be forthcoming?

07:04.591 --> 07:05.592
Don't jinx me.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.929
It's my first time
going to a casino.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.391
It's amazing. There's bright
lights and bells and buzzers

07:12.558 --> 07:13.559
and people yelling.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.102
Ugh.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.274
Veronica says
I'm the nicest guy she knows.

07:20.399 --> 07:22.443
She also says she only wants
to date nice guys.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.921
- Does that mean she wants to date me?
- I bet she doesn't.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.156
No, she does not.
Doesn't make any sense.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.074
Nothing they do
makes any sense.

07:29.575 --> 07:32.077
- I know...
- At least he's not crying anymore.

07:32.211 --> 07:33.837
Devil's got something
to do with it.

07:39.585 --> 07:42.463
Mary, George, I can't
thank you enough for this.

07:42.713 --> 07:43.714
It was our pleasure.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.176
So, Pastor, are you gonna try

07:47.342 --> 07:48.886
and talk things out with Selena?

07:49.178 --> 07:51.346
Well, we're really
not on speaking terms,

07:51.513 --> 07:54.349
so I'll just be heading back to
my office, sleep on the couch.

07:54.516 --> 07:57.019
That's ridiculous.
He can stay with us, can't he?

07:57.853 --> 08:00.439
Uh, I guess that'd be okay.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.691
- Of course it would.
- Oh.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.651
I couldn't possibly impose.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.779
Sure you could.
In fact, you can take my room.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.158
Well, y'all are too kind.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.203
- Hello.
- Oh.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.579
Did y'all have a good time?

08:15.746 --> 08:16.914
- Yes.
- It was great.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.541
Oh, Mom, Pastor Jeff is
gonna be spending the night.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.502
If the kids could
sleep at your place?

08:21.752 --> 08:23.086
No. Bye.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.432
George.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.476
What? What's wrong?

08:38.059 --> 08:39.727
The pastor's up making tea.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.105
What, you want me to blow on it?

08:42.940 --> 08:43.941
Go talk to him.

08:44.316 --> 08:45.317
About what?

08:45.776 --> 08:47.402
I don't know.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.279
Maybe you could give him
a male perspective

08:49.446 --> 08:51.073
on relationship issues.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.659
How about this?

08:53.867 --> 08:56.912
What if I close my eyes
and pray on it?

08:58.288 --> 08:59.414
Hey.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.251
Oh, hi. I hope
I didn't wake you.

09:02.459 --> 09:06.046
Uh, no, no.
Just get... getting some water.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.717
Can I fix you some chamomile?

09:12.261 --> 09:13.262
No, thanks.

09:15.889 --> 09:19.226
So...

09:22.229 --> 09:23.397
Tough times, huh?

09:24.147 --> 09:25.857
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.248
Hey, uh,
does the Bible say anything

09:41.415 --> 09:43.292
about heartache and such?

09:43.792 --> 09:47.129
Psalm 147, verse three:
"The Lord healeth

09:47.296 --> 09:49.590
the broken in heart,
and bindeth up their wounds."

09:50.007 --> 09:52.092
Well, there you go-eth.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.320
Except I'm feeling kicked
in the nethers right now,

09:54.344 --> 09:56.888
and he sure is taking
his sweet time with the healing.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.933
He takes his sweet time
about a lot of things.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.053
Uh, not that I'm complaining.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.856
You know, his will, not mine,
etcetera.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.906
You know, one thing
I can say is that

10:15.616 --> 10:19.244
having a happy marriage
is... it's hard work.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.705
Oh, I know.
As the pastor, people come to me

10:21.872 --> 10:23.790
with relationship problems
all the time.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.418
Bet you hear some juicy
ones, huh?

10:26.835 --> 10:28.378
"Juicy" doesn't begin
to describe it.

10:28.879 --> 10:31.340
- Oh... give me a sample.
- I can't.

10:31.590 --> 10:35.093
There's strict pastor-flock
confidentiality.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.428
Sure. Sure.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.555
Mm.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.101
Mary doesn't tell you
things about us, does she?

10:43.727 --> 10:45.937
I'm... not at liberty to say.

10:47.105 --> 10:48.145
But she does, doesn't she?

10:48.565 --> 10:50.192
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.243
These people clearly don't know
what ten percent means.

11:00.744 --> 11:01.912
What are you talking about?

11:02.496 --> 11:04.223
This is the list
of all the people who belong

11:04.247 --> 11:06.083
to the church
and how much money they donate.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.877
Dorothy and Fred Nelson
gave a dollar last week.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.463
- So?
- They own the Piggly Wiggly.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.256
They can afford
to give much more.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.549
Weird.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.052
You say "Piggly Wiggly"
and suddenly I'm hungry.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.766
Really? You're drinking
in the morning now?

11:23.266 --> 11:25.769
What? Oh, look at that.

11:26.228 --> 11:27.354
Felt later.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.451
Hey, I haven't seen the pastor.
He go home?

11:30.065 --> 11:32.192
He hasn't come out
of Georgie's room.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.444
Maybe he found
Georgie's magazines.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.947
He's a man of God.

11:37.781 --> 11:39.157
You're adorable.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.583
I have stories.
Come back here.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.669
- It's my favorite table.
- Oh, hey, Connie.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.254
Hi, Felicia.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.630
Chip me for a deuce.

11:55.132 --> 11:56.299
How's your daughter doing?

11:56.466 --> 11:57.592
Oh, surgery went great.

11:57.718 --> 11:58.760
Thanks for asking.

11:58.844 --> 12:00.595
Her daughter got
kicked by a horse.

12:00.846 --> 12:03.348
- They had to pin a couple of bones together.
- Oh, my.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.225
She won't be stealing
any more horses

12:05.392 --> 12:06.518
for a little while.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.478
- Your usual, Connie?
- Yeah.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.272
John, you want something?

12:10.856 --> 12:12.482
I would like a Fresca, please.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.067
- Got it, hon.
- Connie.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.568
Duke-North Carolina's
about to start. Want a piece?

12:16.611 --> 12:19.573
Yeah, baby. Give me the
points on Duke for a nickel.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.241
- All right.
- A nickel.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.743
That's a silly bet.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.119
It's 50 bucks.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.122
A thousand nickels.
Less silly.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.332
I must say, uh...

12:29.499 --> 12:32.753
this is a side of you
I've never... seen before.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.379
You're all right with it,
aren't you?

12:34.463 --> 12:35.630
Oh, sure.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.633
When are you gonna
give that man your $50?

12:38.800 --> 12:40.761
Don't worry about it.
Hit me.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.429
I'm a little worried.

12:47.017 --> 12:48.310
Pastor Jeff?

12:48.727 --> 12:50.312
Everything all right in there?

12:51.313 --> 12:52.314
Oh, yeah.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.691
I've just been praying,
napping, crying.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.026
I like to mix it up.

12:56.818 --> 12:57.986
Well, how's it going?

12:58.695 --> 12:59.821
Good, actually.

13:00.155 --> 13:03.492
I have this feeling inside
that I should head home.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.871
Well, then you got to honor
that feeling. That's God.

13:08.205 --> 13:10.373
You're right.
You want to come with?

13:11.500 --> 13:12.709
Do you really want me there

13:12.876 --> 13:14.476
while you patch things up
with your wife?

13:14.753 --> 13:17.233
She's less likely to throw any
steak knives if we have company.

13:19.049 --> 13:22.010
Um... if you think
it'll help, I suppose...

13:22.177 --> 13:23.220
Great, let's hit it.

13:25.514 --> 13:26.515
Oh...

13:27.224 --> 13:29.184
Hello, is this
the Nelson residence?

13:30.185 --> 13:31.520
<i>Oh, good.
I'm Sheldon Cooper,</i>

13:31.686 --> 13:33.271
<i>the executive
assistant secretary</i>

13:33.438 --> 13:35.148
at the First Baptist
Church of Medford.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.165
I'm looking through
our donation records,

13:37.192 --> 13:39.032
and I've noticed that
you've tapered off a bit.

13:40.946 --> 13:43.573
Well, yes, your children's
education is expensive,

13:43.740 --> 13:45.033
but so is running a church.

13:45.992 --> 13:46.993
Oh, boy!

13:47.160 --> 13:49.538
I'll be sure to tell the pastor.
Goodbye.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.210
That earned a sip of Yoo-hoo.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.421
Okay. Who's next?

14:00.006 --> 14:01.508
Wendy and Bill Mackenzie.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.426
Of Mackenzie Chevrolet?

14:03.593 --> 14:05.846
Now those are what we call
"deep pockets."

14:06.805 --> 14:10.267
Pat here, double the ten,
and split the aces.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.351
Connie.

14:11.643 --> 14:14.521
I found an old-fashioned
malt shop where we can

14:14.688 --> 14:17.649
have milkshakes
and listen to the jukebox,

14:17.816 --> 14:19.317
like I never did
in high school.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.111
Yeah, great.
Not now, John.

14:21.570 --> 14:24.406
Okay, well, I was just hoping
we could do something together.

14:24.573 --> 14:27.617
For God's sake, John.
I'm getting my ass kicked here!

14:29.035 --> 14:30.120
I'm sorry.

14:34.749 --> 14:37.961
Oh, Felicia,
you're killing me.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.756
Chip me another deuce.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.474
Hello?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.226
Selena?

14:55.103 --> 14:57.022
Ooh. Big TV, fancy.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.409
<i>"Con amor,</i> Selena."

15:10.201 --> 15:11.202
Which means?

15:11.494 --> 15:15.206
"Life is too short
to be married to a loser.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.250
I'm leaving you.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.210
Love, Selena."

15:20.295 --> 15:21.463
"Love, Selena"?

15:21.630 --> 15:23.840
Well, that's kind
of a mixed message.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.467
Yeah.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.641
Oh, I couldn't tell you
how much to give.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.768
But I can tell you
the Stuckeys stepped up

15:34.935 --> 15:36.478
for a thousand dollars.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.982
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.693
Well, you need to give
what's comfortable for you.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.820
And of course,
I don't need to remind you,

15:45.987 --> 15:47.948
it's entirely tax deductible.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.411
And at the next
pancake breakfast,

15:53.578 --> 15:55.038
you can hold
your head high.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.167
Thank you.
That's very generous.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.460
Goodbye.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.381
The pancake line closed it.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.466
We are so going to heaven.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.344
I don't understand why God
would tell me to go home

16:09.511 --> 16:11.096
just to find out
my wife left me.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.431
Not that he needs me
to defend him,

16:13.598 --> 16:16.309
but in God's defense,
he didn't say she'd be there.

16:17.686 --> 16:20.188
Mary, I hate to say this,
but I think it's time

16:20.355 --> 16:21.398
for me to move on.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.483
I thought even as a teenager,
I'd been called

16:23.650 --> 16:26.903
to preach the word of God,
but maybe that was just my ego.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.030
Maybe I'm not meant to do this.

16:29.572 --> 16:33.201
- Don't say that. You're a great preacher.
- Thank you.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.954
But it's clear.
I need to trod a new path.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.416
Well, what would you do,
trodding-wise?

16:39.833 --> 16:40.834
I don't know.

16:40.917 --> 16:44.004
Maybe work with my hands
amongst men, on an oil rig,

16:44.170 --> 16:45.296
or a fishing trawler.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.717
I also know how to blow glass.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.469
I could turn a pretty penny
at swap meets.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.807
- Those all sound like solid options.
- Mm-hmm.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.976
Oh, red light, red light!

17:10.155 --> 17:11.448
Oh, phooey.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.491
Tell you what, Jody.

17:13.657 --> 17:16.327
Why don't you go upstairs
to your daddy's bedroom,

17:16.493 --> 17:18.163
and see how much
is in his wallet?

17:19.247 --> 17:22.709
Don't worry, it's not
stealing if it's for God.

17:22.876 --> 17:26.003
- What are y'all up to?
- Just helping Mom with some church work.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.840
Well, aren't you two great kids.

17:29.424 --> 17:30.425
We like to think so.

17:33.344 --> 17:34.929
Really? That much?

17:46.941 --> 17:48.777
I think I need
to apologize.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.905
- I know you do.
- I'm very sorry.

17:52.322 --> 17:53.962
Sometimes when things
aren't going my way,

17:54.115 --> 17:55.450
I just get a little cranky.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.286
- May I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.831
Does your gambling
constitute a problem?

18:03.166 --> 18:05.835
Not today. Bam!

18:07.504 --> 18:09.255
Come on. Let me
take you out to dinner.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.426
Don't forget that
you promised Sheldon

18:13.593 --> 18:15.303
if you won,
you'd donate to the church.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.347
You want to see me
get cranky again?

18:17.764 --> 18:20.934
- No, I don't.
- Well, let's go strap on some bibs and eat lobster.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.143
Whoa!

18:22.936 --> 18:24.979
So you're over at First
Baptist Church, huh?

18:25.146 --> 18:26.231
Yes, Officer.

18:26.397 --> 18:27.732
I'm new in this area.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.099
I've been looking
for a church.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.612
Well, you're in luck.
It's a wonderful congregation,

18:32.779 --> 18:35.365
and this man right here
is our beloved pastor.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.952
Oh. Are you his wife?

18:39.244 --> 18:42.330
Oh, no, I'm church secretary.
He's actually single.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.707
- Well, technically...
- He's single.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.336
Well, I'll try
to come by sometime.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.463
Tomorrow's Sunday.
He'll be speaking.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.424
All right. Maybe I'll
see y'all tomorrow.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.929
You have a nice day.

18:58.596 --> 18:59.916
Aren't you gonna
give me a ticket?

19:01.683 --> 19:02.684
Do you want a ticket?

19:02.892 --> 19:05.103
He does not.
Thank you, Officer.

19:09.858 --> 19:11.860
- Pastor?
- Yeah?

19:12.360 --> 19:13.760
You were saying
you don't understand

19:13.903 --> 19:16.990
why God told you to go home.
You get it now?

19:17.448 --> 19:18.449
Think I do.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.331
Welcome, church.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.668
I pray you all had a blessed
and prosperous week.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.921
I'm excited
to share with you

19:32.088 --> 19:35.175
what the Lord put on
my heart for today.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.093
I'm surprised you're here
this morning.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.637
Hey. I got to
support my pal.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.557
The renewal of faith
is something that happens

19:42.765 --> 19:44.350
over and over.

19:44.893 --> 19:48.271
- When you have faith...
- You need to move fast, Officer.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.356
He's not gonna be on
the market for long.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.859
- Roger that.
- For so many months,

19:53.026 --> 19:55.278
our little parish
has been struggling financially.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.822
But by the grace of God
and his provision,

19:58.031 --> 20:01.910
we have received the most
donations in church history!

20:02.785 --> 20:03.828
Praise Jesus!

20:03.995 --> 20:06.956
Praise Jesus!

20:07.457 --> 20:09.751
So it's all Jesus?
We don't get any credit?

20:10.126 --> 20:12.795
- We need to start our own church.
- They don't pay taxes.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.505
It's a very sound
business model.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.634
<i>Say amen when
you get there, huh?</i>
