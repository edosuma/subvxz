01:07.200 --> 01:08.326
Najla?

01:08.368 --> 01:10.097
You can come in.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.468
- The party is raging.
- What did you expect'?

01:14.507 --> 01:16.703
- Did you bring the dress'?
- Yes! Show me.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.644
Look at this.
This only happens to me.

01:20.680 --> 01:21.841
Here, take this.

01:26.853 --> 01:28.287
What?

01:31.291 --> 01:34.420
What's wrong with you'?
You got me a nightgown to wear!

01:34.461 --> 01:38.193
- Come on, it's beautiful!
- Are you kidding'?

01:39.299 --> 01:41.734
Looks like my mum's!

01:41.768 --> 01:44.430
Look at my dress!
And you get me this'?

01:44.471 --> 01:47.133
Just try it and let me see!

01:47.173 --> 01:49.642
OK, I'll do it for you.

01:52.779 --> 01:53.837
What am I doing...

02:01.454 --> 02:02.819
You see how it goes'?

02:03.756 --> 02:05.485
Wait. Let's see.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.455
This is really tricky.

02:17.737 --> 02:18.829
Careful.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.804
- You're choking me.
- And you're destroying my dress.

02:26.913 --> 02:29.814
I'm not going out like this!
Not in public.

02:29.849 --> 02:31.510
It's really nice.

02:31.551 --> 02:32.551
OK.

02:33.186 --> 02:36.156
You'll pay for this later.

02:37.924 --> 02:40.256
- Stick your leg out.
- Don't make me fall.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.626
- Look what I got you.
- Show me.

02:52.605 --> 02:54.232
Gorgeous!

02:54.274 --> 02:56.538
I knew you'd like it. Kiss!

02:57.410 --> 02:58.639
Thank you!

02:59.245 --> 03:00.610
Come on, we're late.

03:00.647 --> 03:04.606
- This is a dress for a fashion model.
- Eat a bit less and you'll be one!

03:08.755 --> 03:10.519
My purse,

03:11.457 --> 03:12.891
my Phone...

03:14.827 --> 03:16.591
Ready?

03:26.973 --> 03:30.705
- Mariouma! You're so beautiful!
- Hey, hovv are you'?

03:30.743 --> 03:32.871
- Nice dress.
- Thank you!

03:32.912 --> 03:34.880
Thrift shop as usual'?

03:34.914 --> 03:36.712
Are you hearing this Najla'?

03:38.785 --> 03:40.651
I can't get my fringe right.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.719
Mine took three hours to do.

03:45.358 --> 03:48.419
Come on, girls, let's have a selfie.

03:50.496 --> 03:53.727
- What's that whistling'?
- My phone.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.564
It's my father.

03:55.602 --> 03:58.594
- Didn't you save his number'?
- I know it by heart.

03:58.638 --> 04:02.506
- Answer him.
- You hear the music outside'?

04:02.542 --> 04:04.237
He's gonna show up again.

04:04.277 --> 04:07.338
No, I asked my mother to call me

04:07.380 --> 04:09.781
as soon as he's on his way to Tunis.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.842
Come on!

04:13.653 --> 04:14.745
OK, it's fine.

04:24.697 --> 04:25.926
Very nice.

04:25.965 --> 04:28.935
- Let me put it on Facebook.
- No Facebook, please.

04:28.968 --> 04:33.030
- I'll send it to you but no Facebook!
- You're friends with your father'?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.503
Let me have some fun, OK'?

04:37.844 --> 04:41.906
"Friends with your father"...
Ha, ha, very funny!

04:41.948 --> 04:45.942
- Come on, she really likes you.
- Yeah, sure!

04:45.985 --> 04:48.420
There he is. Tarak!

04:49.589 --> 04:53.423
- Come on, push the subscriptions.
- I'm on it!

04:53.459 --> 04:56.292
- Where do we put the bags'?
- In the cloakroom.

05:07.607 --> 05:08.972
Did you see the guy'?

05:09.008 --> 05:10.840
Just there.

05:11.911 --> 05:12.911
N0, I didn't.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.471
At the entrance, with the bouncer.

05:15.515 --> 05:17.381
The bouncer is on his own.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.885
I'll show him to you later.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.513
Everybody paid'? No freeloaders'?

05:22.555 --> 05:24.717
No worries as long as I am here.

05:24.757 --> 05:27.818
- Do you want to go over the cash'?
- We'll do it tomorrow.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.625
Najla, I've been looking for this.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.564
- It won't match the dress.
- I'll put it around my hips.

05:33.599 --> 05:37.433
Don't you have a scarf
to go crazy dancing'?

05:39.038 --> 05:40.096
Come on!

06:04.831 --> 06:06.390
Water, please.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.667
He's over there.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.401
He's cute.

06:27.754 --> 06:31.554
. Subscriptions are now open
for just fifty dinars!

06:32.592 --> 06:36.620
If you want to join,
come and see our treasurer...

06:36.662 --> 06:37.925
Where is Mariam'?

06:39.766 --> 06:44.067
Let's thank the beautiful Mariam

06:44.103 --> 06:45.764
who organised this evening.

06:50.843 --> 06:55.405
Ladies staying in dorms,
enjoy yourselves and have fun,

06:55.448 --> 06:59.407
and don't worry about a thing,
we've chartered a bus

06:59.452 --> 07:03.082
that will take you home
before the dorms close their doors.

07:03.122 --> 07:08.151
So, without further ado,
here's DJ Fatarya

07:08.194 --> 07:10.925
for a belly dancing set!

07:15.001 --> 07:16.696
Everybody on the dancefloor!

07:18.805 --> 07:26.110
BEAUTY AND THE DOGS

08:46.592 --> 08:48.617
- Look!
- Yes, she's talking to him.

08:48.661 --> 08:51.221
She does that whenever I like someone.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.733
- Go see her.
- OK, give me my bag.

08:53.766 --> 08:56.827
- Is he still there'?
- No, he's gone.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.779
Who's that guy you were talking to'?

09:06.812 --> 09:09.304
- Why do you want to know'?
- Just asking.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.850
- Oh, just asking'?
- Yes!

09:12.118 --> 09:13.142
Tell me!

09:13.185 --> 09:14.812
Come with me.

09:14.854 --> 09:17.789
- Please, Amani...
- Come on!

10:32.298 --> 10:34.926
- Do you want a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

10:44.210 --> 10:45.700
Can you get the door for me'?

11:37.930 --> 11:39.762
Don't worry, they're gone.

12:33.452 --> 12:36.820
Come with me, don't be frightened.

12:38.357 --> 12:40.257
<i>ROSEBUSH CLINIC.</i>

13:13.859 --> 13:14.917
Come.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.238
Come on, Mariam.

13:29.275 --> 13:32.006
You need to see a doctor.

13:40.553 --> 13:41.577
Hello.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.119
Hi, welcome.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.980
Can I help you'?

13:46.525 --> 13:48.516
She needs to see a doctor.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.495
Can I see her ID'?

14:02.508 --> 14:05.205
Sorry, but I said her ID.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.611
Lam sorry but she lost her papers.

14:08.314 --> 14:09.873
What's wrong with her'?

14:11.917 --> 14:16.320
She's been raped
and we need a document to prove it.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.289
Please help us.

14:18.324 --> 14:21.055
Hey you!
Where do you think you're going'?

14:22.094 --> 14:24.358
Can I leave the keys with you'?

14:24.396 --> 14:28.196
- Are you going to belong'?
- I'm just getting a coffee.

14:28.968 --> 14:31.938
Why don't you use
the coffee machine inside?

14:31.971 --> 14:34.633
That's not coffee,
it's more like dark water.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.139
When we first got it,
the coffee was great.

14:38.177 --> 14:41.078
Someone's stealing the powder
and diluting it.

14:42.014 --> 14:43.311
I'm sorry.

14:43.349 --> 14:46.649
- Did you catch a cold'?
- There's a virus going around.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.547
Can we see a doctor'?

14:48.587 --> 14:51.215
I asked you for her ID!

14:51.257 --> 14:54.386
And I told you she lost her ID.
You have my passport.

14:55.127 --> 14:58.392
Please, I need her ID card.

14:58.430 --> 15:02.060
OK, listen.
Look at us and do me a favor.

15:02.101 --> 15:06.095
Let her see a doctor,
she'll come back tomorrow with some ID.

15:06.138 --> 15:09.199
I have to put her name into the system.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.141
So do it!

15:11.176 --> 15:15.943
L-low can I do that
if I can't prove who she is'?

15:15.981 --> 15:19.281
Get me her papers
and I will take her to the doctor.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.447
Don't you understand'?

15:21.487 --> 15:25.082
She lost her papers in the car
of the men who raped her.

15:25.124 --> 15:27.149
Don't you get it'?
She's been raped!

15:27.192 --> 15:30.526
Why are you yelling at me'?
Am I the one who raped her'?

15:30.562 --> 15:32.690
- I didn't say that.
- Wait a minute.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.233
Excuse me, who raped her'?

15:38.971 --> 15:39.971
I'm sorry.

15:45.010 --> 15:48.207
This institution can't admit her

15:48.247 --> 15:50.079
without a proper ID.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.674
The law doesn't allow me.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.515
What law'?

15:53.552 --> 15:56.453
What law forbids a human being
from seeing a doctor'?

15:56.488 --> 15:59.321
Do you think I'm stupid'?

15:59.358 --> 16:01.417
If she's ill,
she can see a doctor.

16:01.460 --> 16:05.158
From what I understand,
she needs a certificate to prove a rape

16:05.197 --> 16:07.564
but she can't prove her identity.

16:07.599 --> 16:12.662
What if she wanted to accuse somebody'?

16:12.705 --> 16:17.142
What's wrong with you'?
What's your problem?

16:17.176 --> 16:18.268
This is bullshit!

16:18.310 --> 16:20.369
You think she's not ill'?

16:20.412 --> 16:23.313
Look at the state of her!
She doesn't look ill to you'?

16:25.985 --> 16:29.285
Oh God! What is this'?

16:31.757 --> 16:33.384
Let's get her some fresh air.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.658
Get her out of here!

16:39.298 --> 16:40.298
Let go of me.

16:43.602 --> 16:46.731
- Did you notify the authorities'?
- What authorities'?

16:57.549 --> 16:59.608
Look out!
Are you trying to get killed'?

17:01.320 --> 17:02.412
What's with you'?

17:03.355 --> 17:04.617
Be careful!

17:05.491 --> 17:07.084
Do you want to kill yourself'?

17:10.095 --> 17:11.221
Is she alright'?

17:16.068 --> 17:18.765
A certificate from a private clinic
is worthless.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.135
Why'?

17:20.172 --> 17:22.641
You pay and you get what you want.

17:25.176 --> 17:27.612
She needs a certificate
from a public hospital.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.375
Otherwise the police won't accept it.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.711
MY Passport.

18:25.571 --> 18:29.098
Where is the ministry of Health'?

18:29.575 --> 18:33.307
The hospital makes us sicker
than the patients!

18:33.345 --> 18:35.143
Hospitals are awful!

18:35.180 --> 18:40.118
Come see my husband
who's been lying there for three hours.

18:40.152 --> 18:41.551
What are you showing them'?

18:41.587 --> 18:46.491
I'm showing them the state I'm in,
forgotten for three hours...

18:46.525 --> 18:48.789
This young woman needs
to see a doctor.

18:48.827 --> 18:50.420
Give me a break!

18:50.462 --> 18:53.693
They treat us like dogs in this country.

18:53.732 --> 18:56.827
Look for yourself, the man is dying!

19:07.246 --> 19:08.873
It's hopeless, just have a seat.

19:41.380 --> 19:42.779
I'll wait for your signal.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.243
Is my hair OK'?

19:46.852 --> 19:48.752
Let's have another take.

19:59.898 --> 20:02.663
- Let's film her.
- Don't! No filming!

20:02.701 --> 20:05.261
That's fine, put the camera down.

20:05.304 --> 20:07.932
OK, we're not filming you.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.934
You were really raped by policemen'?

20:10.976 --> 20:13.604
I can guarantee that they were cops.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.704
Let me call my boss.

20:16.748 --> 20:17.806
Hold this for me.

20:19.518 --> 20:21.452
What's wrong with you'?

20:21.486 --> 20:24.854
Nobody is paying attention.
We need to get some help!

20:25.591 --> 20:28.686
She won't help,
she'll just take advantage of us.

20:28.727 --> 20:29.990
She is a journalist.

20:30.762 --> 20:34.494
She can turn this
into a public interest story.

20:35.634 --> 20:38.467
Public interest story'?
I'll be disgraced!

20:38.503 --> 20:40.767
What happened to you
is already a disgrace!

20:40.806 --> 20:43.798
Shouldn't we disgrace them
to keep them accountable'?

20:45.277 --> 20:46.745
God will punish them.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.678
What does that mean'?

20:49.348 --> 20:51.783
Are you filing charges or not'?

20:51.817 --> 20:54.650
Because I'm not giving up!

20:55.254 --> 20:58.690
- Don't joke about this.
- Do I look like I'm joking?

20:59.024 --> 21:00.719
Policemen or not'?

21:00.759 --> 21:03.956
I have a video of one of them.
See for yourself!

21:05.464 --> 21:06.795
Give me your number.

21:13.805 --> 21:15.432
I'll take yours too.

21:16.608 --> 21:21.341
She lost her bag in their car.
Her phone and papers were inside.

21:21.380 --> 21:25.476
Trust me, if this is true,
I'll investigate.

21:25.517 --> 21:28.350
This is my business card.
You must call me.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.548
Make sure you don't lose it.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.719
Don't be afraid, call me!

21:44.069 --> 21:46.470
That's it, you're happy now'?

21:46.505 --> 21:47.870
What do you mean'?

21:47.906 --> 21:49.840
And what I went through'?

21:49.875 --> 21:53.641
Many men went through
the same thing in jail.

21:53.679 --> 21:56.944
- What's that got to do with it'?
- What planet are you on'?

21:56.982 --> 21:59.576
Do you understand what's going on here'?

21:59.618 --> 22:01.916
Why did we have a revolution?

22:01.953 --> 22:04.513
People have died for their rights!

22:04.556 --> 22:06.581
So these monsters can pay!

22:07.592 --> 22:10.459
If we accept to be humiliated,
forget about it!

22:11.396 --> 22:12.557
Forget about it...

22:14.666 --> 22:19.433
You have to grab your rights
with both hands.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.633
If you give up,
they'll eat you alive!

22:21.673 --> 22:23.004
Do you understand'?

22:23.041 --> 22:25.066
Why are you lecturing me'?

22:25.844 --> 22:29.610
After what happened to me,
I shouldn't just file a complaint.

22:29.648 --> 22:32.049
I should slaughter them
and drink their blood.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.012
I apologize.

22:34.953 --> 22:36.751
Why did we come here'?

22:36.788 --> 22:39.689
To see a doctor
and get a medical certificate.

22:39.725 --> 22:44.128
So we can throw it at the police
and force them to do their job.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.489
Right?

22:56.908 --> 22:58.103
Come with me.

23:10.122 --> 23:13.422
We've been here for two hours
and nobody is listening.

23:13.458 --> 23:16.917
This girl has been raped
and we need a medical certificate.

23:16.962 --> 23:18.396
Please help us.

23:21.099 --> 23:23.796
- She looks fine.
- L-low does she look fine'?

23:23.835 --> 23:26.702
Are you wounded'?
Do you have anything broken'?

23:27.439 --> 23:29.032
This is an emergency ward.

23:29.074 --> 23:32.066
- Isn't this an emergency'?
- This is the ER!

23:32.110 --> 23:34.909
I know that!
It's not a slaughterhouse.

23:34.946 --> 23:38.041
I understand.
Moez, come over here please.

23:39.684 --> 23:42.779
This girl has been raped.
Where shall I take her'?

23:42.821 --> 23:45.017
To a gynecologist in maternity.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.717
Come with me.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.725
Please wait for her in here.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.425
She'll be back.

24:17.489 --> 24:18.752
Wait here a second.

24:53.592 --> 24:54.889
May God protect you.

24:56.962 --> 24:58.862
What exactly did they do to you'?

24:59.865 --> 25:02.800
Did they touch you'?
Did they take your clothes off'?

25:03.168 --> 25:05.603
- L-low many were there'?
- Where is the doctor'?

25:06.171 --> 25:07.229
She's coming.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.948
What's wrong with you'?

25:23.922 --> 25:26.823
- What's going on'?
- She's been raped.

25:27.759 --> 25:30.956
Who told you to come here'?
This isn't my specialty.

25:30.996 --> 25:32.691
Whose specialty is it, then'?

25:32.731 --> 25:34.961
I need a medical certificate
to sue them.

25:35.800 --> 25:36.995
To sue them'?

25:37.702 --> 25:39.727
You need a forensic doctor.

25:40.105 --> 25:41.971
Where can I find one'?

25:42.007 --> 25:44.977
You can't just knock on the door.
The police send you.

25:45.610 --> 25:47.669
It's the police who did it.

25:47.712 --> 25:50.272
I need a certificate
so I can file a complaint.

25:50.315 --> 25:51.805
The police'?

25:52.584 --> 25:56.680
- Will you please examine me'?
- I am not qualified to examine you.

25:56.721 --> 26:00.589
- I'm begging you, help me!
- It's against the law, I can't.

26:00.926 --> 26:03.588
- I'm not qualified.
- Please, help me!

26:03.628 --> 26:05.221
I can't!

26:05.263 --> 26:07.925
- We're at eight centimetres.
- I'm coming.

26:09.100 --> 26:12.297
You should take
an emergency contraceptive pill.

26:12.337 --> 26:13.896
You have enough problems.

26:13.939 --> 26:17.739
- Would you give me a prescription'?
- You don't need one.

26:35.660 --> 26:36.855
Wait a minute.

26:38.196 --> 26:40.893
I'll take you to the forensic doctor.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.229
Come with me.

26:45.670 --> 26:48.731
Wait a second.
Let me clean you up.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.241
Don't be afraid.

26:57.315 --> 26:58.373
Come on.

27:42.093 --> 27:43.390
Wait over there.

27:46.131 --> 27:47.394
She has been raped.

27:48.166 --> 27:52.194
I took her to Madame Khelifi
who told her to see a forensic doctor.

27:52.237 --> 27:54.001
I brought her to you.

27:54.039 --> 27:55.871
Did the police send you'?

27:57.308 --> 27:58.308
No.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.744
She was raped by policemen.

28:00.779 --> 28:04.181
She wants to press charges
and she needs a certificate.

28:04.215 --> 28:05.705
Please help her.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.345
I'll see.

28:13.992 --> 28:15.289
May God help you.

28:21.132 --> 28:22.361
Good evening.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.892
I'd like to report a rape.

28:25.403 --> 28:28.236
Hisham Bahrouni, forensic doctor.

28:28.273 --> 28:30.970
Thank you.
The victim is next to me.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.702
No, she has no apparent injuries.

28:34.746 --> 28:38.774
She says she was raped by policemen
and she wants a medical certificate.

28:41.186 --> 28:42.381
What's your name'?

28:43.154 --> 28:45.953
- Mariam Chaouch.
- Her name is Mariam Chaouch.

28:47.992 --> 28:49.721
Your national ID number'?

28:50.228 --> 28:53.323
- I don't know it.
- No, she doesn't know it.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.733
Very well.

28:57.769 --> 28:58.895
Good evening.

29:02.741 --> 29:03.970
Well, Mariam.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.377
I can't examine you now.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.745
The police need
to start an investigation first.

29:09.781 --> 29:13.740
You must go to the police station
and file a complaint.

29:13.785 --> 29:17.346
They know about your case
and they are expecting you.

29:18.189 --> 29:19.213
OK?

29:19.257 --> 29:21.783
Then, they will send you back here.

29:22.293 --> 29:23.920
Do you understand me, Mariam'?

29:23.962 --> 29:25.487
- All right?
- Yes.

29:25.530 --> 29:26.827
OK then.

30:10.074 --> 30:11.940
Where did this happen'?

30:11.976 --> 30:13.944
Next to the Palace Hotel,
on the beach.

30:14.345 --> 30:15.904
Let me see some ID.

30:20.819 --> 30:21.877
Your ID.

30:22.453 --> 30:24.581
She lost her hand bag in their car.

30:25.123 --> 30:26.955
Name, surname and age.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.857
- Me'? <i>'</i> Yes» You!

30:33.431 --> 30:36.059
Mariam Chaouch, 21 years old.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.296
Age: 21.

30:38.336 --> 30:40.964
Name: Mariam, daughter of...

30:41.906 --> 30:43.271
What's your father's name'?

30:44.052 --> 30:45.052
Why'?

30:45.076 --> 30:47.135
- What?
- Why my father's name'?

30:47.178 --> 30:49.306
- We want to propose!
- Steady!

30:49.347 --> 30:50.837
Go easy on the lady.

30:51.316 --> 30:52.977
Give him your father's name.

30:56.321 --> 30:57.982
Ahmed Chaouch.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.547
Mariam, daughter of Ahmed.

31:02.527 --> 31:03.892
Come on, Mariam.

31:06.965 --> 31:08.433
Tell me everything.

31:12.403 --> 31:15.134
You have to tell me
so I know how to proceed.

31:20.511 --> 31:24.175
We were at a party organized
by our university in a hotel.

31:25.550 --> 31:29.180
We stepped out
for a walk on the beach.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.382
The hotel is by the sea.

31:31.422 --> 31:32.651
Who's "we"?

31:32.891 --> 31:34.655
L-low do you say "hotel" in Arabic?

31:35.159 --> 31:36.183
Me and him.

31:38.663 --> 31:42.224
- Did you drink alcohol in the hotel'?
- No.

31:43.167 --> 31:44.657
And the girl'?

31:44.903 --> 31:46.496
I've never touched it.

31:46.537 --> 31:48.505
She's never touched it...

31:52.076 --> 31:53.908
And after you saw the sea'?

31:54.512 --> 31:55.673
What happened'?

31:57.215 --> 32:00.241
- After that...
- Please, you'll get your chance.

32:00.952 --> 32:02.613
I'm talking to Mariam. Go ahead.

32:05.657 --> 32:10.026
We were by the sea
when a white car pulled up.

32:10.061 --> 32:12.996
Three men stepped out,
yelling "Police".

32:14.132 --> 32:16.066
They turned their headlights on us.

32:17.702 --> 32:21.366
The older one handcuffed my friend.

32:23.107 --> 32:26.702
He asked them to prove
they were policemen.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.346
They stuck their badges in his face,

32:29.647 --> 32:32.173
screaming and cursing.

32:32.216 --> 32:33.479
"Cursing."

32:35.486 --> 32:36.681
One of them told me:

32:36.721 --> 32:40.351
"You must be married
and you are committing adultery."

32:41.259 --> 32:42.624
They wanted to arrest me.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.094
Adultery...

32:47.432 --> 32:51.630
I told them I wasn't married
and I wanted to go home.

32:53.171 --> 32:57.199
The two policemen
forced me into the car.

32:57.709 --> 33:01.145
The third policeman took my friend.

33:03.681 --> 33:05.740
Let's get our story straight first.

33:06.250 --> 33:09.311
Don't say policemen
if you're not sure.

33:09.354 --> 33:10.412
OK?

33:20.465 --> 33:22.126
Yes, they're here.

33:36.647 --> 33:39.173
Where were we, Mr Raouf'?

33:39.217 --> 33:40.685
We were at the adultery.

33:40.718 --> 33:43.483
No, we were at the car.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.353
She got into the car
with two men.

33:45.390 --> 33:47.722
No, they forced her into the car.

33:52.430 --> 33:53.591
And then'?

33:58.336 --> 34:01.203
What happened afterwards'?
We don't have all night.

34:05.309 --> 34:07.334
Then they raped me in the car.

34:08.079 --> 34:10.672
- What did you say'?
- They raped her in the car.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.241
"They raped me in the car."

34:13.284 --> 34:15.685
- The young man was watching'?
- What?

34:19.123 --> 34:20.386
No.

34:20.425 --> 34:22.655
Before they started,

34:23.694 --> 34:28.291
the man who handcuffed him
took him to the hotel.

34:28.833 --> 34:30.665
What did you do in the hotel'?

34:30.701 --> 34:33.726
He asked me for 300 dinars
to let us go.

34:33.771 --> 34:37.206
I didn't have it so I took him
to a cash machine,

34:37.241 --> 34:38.469
to get some peace.

34:40.210 --> 34:44.273
OK, and before they raped you,
tell me what you talked about.

34:49.719 --> 34:52.587
I was in the car with them,

34:52.623 --> 34:54.387
in the back seat.

34:54.425 --> 34:57.861
They were rubbing up against me
like devils,

34:58.096 --> 35:01.396
fondling me,
their hands were everywhere.

35:03.134 --> 35:07.230
I had 3O dinars in my bag,
I told them to take it.

35:09.707 --> 35:12.836
One of them took the bag
and threw it on the floor.

35:14.645 --> 35:15.840
He grabbed me...

35:17.448 --> 35:20.474
I started shaking,

35:20.518 --> 35:22.350
and screaming in fear.

35:23.554 --> 35:26.114
I turned to look for him,

35:26.724 --> 35:28.283
but he was gone.

35:28.693 --> 35:29.785
<i>He'?</i>

35:30.461 --> 35:31.622
Who is "he"?

35:32.730 --> 35:34.755
What's your relationship with him'?

35:36.701 --> 35:39.261
- He's my fiancé.
- Your fiancé'?

35:39.837 --> 35:41.737
What's the name of your fiancé'?

35:41.772 --> 35:43.331
My name is Youssef.

35:47.912 --> 35:51.644
Youssef'?
Really, your name is "Joseph"?

35:52.350 --> 35:53.749
I'm asking her,

35:53.784 --> 35:57.277
because she's been using the 3rd person
for you from the start.

35:59.223 --> 36:00.691
- Youssef what'?
- Youssef...

36:00.725 --> 36:02.887
- No, I'll find out on my own.
- Go ahead.

36:02.927 --> 36:06.557
Would you be Joseph the carpenter,
fiancé of the Virgin Mary'?

36:06.597 --> 36:08.463
In that case, you are in trouble.

36:08.499 --> 36:13.335
In the Koran,
we don't recognize Joseph the carpenter.

36:14.438 --> 36:17.305
And in our religion,
the Virgin Mary is not engaged.

36:18.242 --> 36:19.437
<i>My name's Youssef Dawn.</i>

36:19.477 --> 36:22.845
We are the State,
and we don't rape young women.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.316
- They had badges...
- So what'?

36:27.418 --> 36:30.410
We have so many devils,
like the Virgin Mary said.

36:30.955 --> 36:33.549
Devils that announce the prophecy.

36:33.591 --> 36:37.619
Could they have made you pregnant
with the Antichrist?

36:38.262 --> 36:41.664
Mr Raouf,
these are signs of the end of times.

36:41.699 --> 36:44.930
Stop, Lassaad,
you know I don't like that stuff.

36:44.969 --> 36:47.870
Devils and the Antichrist...
It gives me the creeps.

36:47.905 --> 36:51.398
The creeps? Do your job
and show us some respect.

36:51.442 --> 36:52.705
We have rights!

36:52.743 --> 36:54.370
Some respect'?

36:54.412 --> 36:57.746
Your sarcasm,
and him with his innuendoes...

36:57.782 --> 37:01.241
You wanted a report'?
Well, here's your report.

37:01.285 --> 37:04.311
Never satisfied!
Is this your police station?

37:04.355 --> 37:06.289
Are you doing us a favor'?

37:06.324 --> 37:07.792
You better calm down!

37:09.660 --> 37:12.960
Mister Lassaad,
I'm stepping out to buy cigarettes.

37:13.564 --> 37:16.261
- That might calm me down.
- Go ahead.

37:21.505 --> 37:23.667
Very well, Mister Youssef.

37:26.377 --> 37:29.677
What happened with the guy
at the cash machine'?

37:29.714 --> 37:31.307
- You want an answer?
- Yes!

37:31.349 --> 37:32.976
Who's going to type my statement'?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.654
Are you serious'?

37:39.357 --> 37:41.917
Complaining about being raped
in this skimpy dress'?

37:41.959 --> 37:46.556
Are you serious'?
You, with this cosy job'?

37:46.597 --> 37:49.567
I like the place,
so comfortable, with A/C.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.626
I think I'm going to move in here.

37:54.639 --> 37:56.539
You are really funny!

37:57.575 --> 38:00.408
I'm trying to remember
where I've seen you before.

38:00.745 --> 38:03.373
- Haven't we met before?
- Yes, we have.

38:03.414 --> 38:04.745
Really? Where'?

38:04.782 --> 38:06.944
- Take a wild guess.
- Really?

38:07.718 --> 38:10.813
We met at the Kasbah sit-in.
Do you remember me now'?

38:12.623 --> 38:14.057
The Kasbah sit-in...

38:22.533 --> 38:24.558
Why did you tell them
I was your fiancé'?

38:26.470 --> 38:29.599
I didn't want them
to get the wrong idea about us.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.734
The wrong idea'?
What planet are you from'?

38:31.776 --> 38:34.837
We are here to file a complaint
against their colleagues.

38:34.879 --> 38:38.338
They already have the wrong idea!

38:38.382 --> 38:41.579
Don't talk to me like that,
this is already hard enough!

38:41.619 --> 38:43.815
Mariam, don't say anything
but the truth.

38:43.854 --> 38:46.880
Anything else will be held against us.

38:46.924 --> 38:49.950
I've never been
in a police station before!

38:49.994 --> 38:51.621
I'm just following you.

38:52.697 --> 38:55.394
I haven't forced you.
You can go home.

38:55.433 --> 38:56.958
I have no home to go to!

38:57.735 --> 38:59.635
What do you mean'?

39:00.338 --> 39:03.831
I live in a dorm
and the dorm closes at 1O pm.

39:03.874 --> 39:06.775
Even if I wanted to go
to a hotel room to die,

39:06.811 --> 39:10.770
I have no money, no ID, no phone.
I have nothing!

39:10.815 --> 39:11.976
My passport...

39:22.993 --> 39:25.621
Look at this,
they are not writing anything.

39:28.632 --> 39:29.997
What are you doing over there'?

39:30.634 --> 39:34.502
You're only pretending to write.
You think you're doing us a favor'?

39:34.538 --> 39:36.870
Calm down, sweetheart,
it's not good for you.

39:36.907 --> 39:39.376
- I'm not angry.
- Really, you're not'?

39:39.977 --> 39:42.537
You'd have preferred
to be in her place'?

39:42.580 --> 39:45.049
I can help you with that, if you want.

39:45.850 --> 39:48.842
Let go of me! Let go!

39:49.687 --> 39:52.156
If you're a man, hit me!

39:52.390 --> 39:53.551
I'm not hitting you.

39:53.591 --> 39:55.992
You're a coward, a piece of shit!

39:56.026 --> 39:58.859
You'd love to arrest me.

39:58.896 --> 40:01.627
- You raised your hand to me.
- I didn't touch you.

40:01.932 --> 40:04.958
I've spent my life
chasing bums like you.

40:05.002 --> 40:07.835
If you were a man,
she wouldn't have been raped.

40:07.872 --> 40:09.397
And now, you're a hero'?

40:09.440 --> 40:11.602
Please, let go of him.

40:11.642 --> 40:14.907
If she wasn't here,
I'd have broken every bone in your body.

40:15.746 --> 40:17.544
You want to file a complaint'?

40:18.182 --> 40:21.948
Go to the police where it happened.
We can't do anything.

40:21.986 --> 40:24.751
- I knew that as soon as I saw you.
- Get out!

40:24.789 --> 40:26.450
- Go.
- We'll speak again.

40:43.007 --> 40:45.999
No, he's not in uniform,
he's wearing a checked shirt.

40:46.610 --> 40:49.545
He has a mustache.
Dark skinned and quite old.

40:52.516 --> 40:53.847
What do you mean "where"?

40:53.884 --> 40:57.445
The camera of the cash machine,
by the hotel shops.

40:58.055 --> 40:59.682
Do you have another one'?

41:05.229 --> 41:06.719
So you found it'?

41:07.765 --> 41:10.666
Thanks a lot, cousin.
Would you make me a copy'?

41:13.737 --> 41:16.206
Yasser, please,
get me a copy of the video.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.231
I never ask you for anything.

41:19.543 --> 41:22.205
Is this the good time
to explain what happened'?

41:25.649 --> 41:26.878
OK, listen to me...

41:29.086 --> 41:31.487
- What video'?
- Hang on.

41:34.725 --> 41:35.749
Shit!

41:38.796 --> 41:41.060
Video from the surveillance camera.

41:44.835 --> 41:46.894
Sorry,
Iran out of credit as usual.

41:48.038 --> 41:51.201
Listen, don't bother
with official requests or anything.

41:51.242 --> 41:54.735
Put the video on play,
record it with your cell phone

41:54.778 --> 41:56.837
and send it to me
on my phone right away.

41:57.748 --> 41:59.876
Can you send me the video or not'?

42:01.752 --> 42:02.810
OK.

42:03.721 --> 42:06.782
And can you send me
five dinars credit for my phone'?

42:06.824 --> 42:08.690
I'm totally out of money.

42:10.561 --> 42:12.086
OK, at least two dinars.

42:13.864 --> 42:15.161
Thank you, cousin.

42:23.140 --> 42:26.235
Video of the surveillance camera
at the cash machine

42:26.277 --> 42:28.177
where I took the cop.

42:28.212 --> 42:32.308
My cousin is a security guard
at the hotel. He found it.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.109
We have proof now.

42:37.788 --> 42:40.621
In fact, my cousin
got me into the party.

42:40.658 --> 42:42.752
- You didn't pay for a ticket'?
- What?

42:42.793 --> 42:43.954
Never mind.

43:05.683 --> 43:07.708
This is the police station.

43:12.056 --> 43:13.217
Take this.

43:15.326 --> 43:17.294
- What is this'?
- Wait.

43:18.829 --> 43:19.990
Where's the rest'?

43:21.365 --> 43:24.232
- That's all I have.
- What do you mean'?

43:24.802 --> 43:27.237
Lucky we're in front of
the police station.

43:27.271 --> 43:28.636
Really?

43:28.672 --> 43:32.631
Please, Mariam, I need to talk to him.
I'll come afterwards.

43:32.676 --> 43:34.667
I'm not going alone.

43:34.712 --> 43:36.840
- You're not alone.
- Boss,

43:36.880 --> 43:39.815
there is a cash machine here.

43:39.850 --> 43:43.286
You are listening too'?
Mariam, please, step out.

43:43.320 --> 43:47.052
- No way, I'm not going on my own.
- I'll follow you.

43:47.091 --> 43:52.029
Brother, if you have no money,
why are you putting her through this'?

43:52.062 --> 43:53.325
Just take the bus!

43:53.364 --> 43:56.129
Are you hearing this'?
Mariam, step out!

43:56.166 --> 43:57.361
Get out!

43:58.102 --> 44:00.230
Don't talk to me like a thief!

44:00.270 --> 44:02.932
- And in front of the girl!
- Just pay me then!

44:02.973 --> 44:04.702
- So, how much'?
- Two dinars.

44:04.742 --> 44:07.404
- All this fuss for two dinars'?
- It's money!

44:07.645 --> 44:11.309
I know it's money!
Who told you I wouldn't pay'?

44:32.870 --> 44:34.201
L-low can I help you'?

44:35.406 --> 44:38.171
- I want to file a complaint.
- For what'?

44:39.343 --> 44:42.438
- Can anyone take it'?
- What's the motive'?

44:43.881 --> 44:45.781
Can we go inside?

44:46.694 --> 44:47.694
Go ahead.

44:47.718 --> 44:50.346
Where are you going'?
Go ahead, tell us your story.

44:53.957 --> 44:55.857
Can we talk privately?

44:55.893 --> 44:58.260
Privately... Sure, why not'?

45:03.033 --> 45:05.195
Two policemen raped me.

45:10.808 --> 45:11.934
Come with me.

45:21.752 --> 45:23.049
Where did this happen'?

45:25.322 --> 45:26.812
On the beach.

45:27.458 --> 45:29.153
By The Palace Hotel.

45:31.228 --> 45:32.491
Want some advice'?

45:32.730 --> 45:35.859
Go home, get some rest, think it over.

45:35.899 --> 45:38.925
If you still don't feel alright,
come back next week.

45:40.838 --> 45:42.067
Where do you live'?

45:43.307 --> 45:46.333
- Al Farabi students' dorm.
- So you're not from Tunis'?

45:46.376 --> 45:47.935
Good night.

45:47.978 --> 45:50.743
Everyone's about to leave.

45:50.781 --> 45:52.340
I advise you to go home too.

45:56.220 --> 45:57.346
Good night.

45:58.822 --> 46:00.790
What's her story'?

46:00.824 --> 46:04.055
She says that two policemen raped her.

46:04.094 --> 46:06.426
As usual, everything's our fault.

46:06.463 --> 46:08.955
What will they accuse us of next?

46:37.995 --> 46:41.932
I'm sorry, Mariam, I was stuck with him.
I hate bad manners.

46:41.965 --> 46:44.400
I want to go home and change my dress.

46:44.434 --> 46:47.096
I need get a good sleep.

46:47.137 --> 46:50.801
- What about the complaint'?
- We'll do it tomorrow.

46:50.841 --> 46:52.832
Tomorrow will be too late.

46:55.179 --> 46:56.374
Listen to me.

47:00.184 --> 47:02.278
Can I go home with you'?

47:04.054 --> 47:05.579
- Hello!
- Where are you going'?

47:05.823 --> 47:08.053
- We are expected inside.
- Go ahead.

47:11.395 --> 47:15.423
You can't come home with me because
lam staying with my cousin tonight.

47:17.301 --> 47:19.895
Can I use your phone
to call my roommate'?

47:19.937 --> 47:22.304
She can beg the guard
to open the gate,

47:22.339 --> 47:25.172
even throw me a rope... anything.

47:25.209 --> 47:27.200
I've got no credit on my phone.

47:27.244 --> 47:30.942
I gave the credits my cousin sent me
to the cab driver.

47:30.981 --> 47:33.882
Please, we are here to file a complaint.

47:33.917 --> 47:34.975
Let's get inside.

47:56.940 --> 48:00.308
They told me the station is closing.

48:00.344 --> 48:02.244
- Who said that'?
- The policeman.

48:02.279 --> 48:04.509
Come with me and we'll open it.

48:09.219 --> 48:11.950
- Who said the station was closing'?
- Ask him.

48:11.989 --> 48:13.047
Good evening.

48:15.025 --> 48:17.016
What do you want, with this attitude?

48:18.028 --> 48:19.462
We want to file a complaint.

48:19.496 --> 48:22.090
- With these manners'?
- What's going on'?

48:22.132 --> 48:25.625
The guy is aggressive and he says
he wants to file a complaint.

48:25.669 --> 48:28.434
So what's the problem'?
Let him do it!

48:28.472 --> 48:30.065
Alright, come this way.

48:31.241 --> 48:33.972
Go ahead, make your complaint.

48:40.083 --> 48:42.142
Now this is something.

48:51.695 --> 48:53.185
What's going on'?

48:53.230 --> 48:57.189
The chick came back with some hot shot
and they're filing a complaint.

48:57.234 --> 48:59.293
- Really?
- Absolutely.

49:26.363 --> 49:29.333
Can I ask you for something, please'?

49:29.366 --> 49:30.458
Go ahead.

49:31.168 --> 49:34.399
Do you have any clothing'?

49:34.438 --> 49:37.738
Anything I can borrow,
a dress, a jacket or a skirt'?

49:38.241 --> 49:39.606
I don't have any clothes.

49:53.190 --> 49:55.215
Can I use the curtain over there'?

50:08.372 --> 50:10.272
- Take your panties off.
- What?

50:11.141 --> 50:13.007
Take them off
and put them in here.

50:19.216 --> 50:20.706
For the forensic police.

50:58.522 --> 51:00.081
Let me speak to Chedly.

51:01.591 --> 51:02.649
Chedly,

51:03.193 --> 51:06.060
come escort the plaintive
to the forensic doctor.

51:06.463 --> 51:10.627
And on your way,
in the closet next to the arrest cell,

51:10.667 --> 51:12.567
there's a veil, bring it with you.

51:17.674 --> 51:19.506
They're getting you a veil.

51:25.315 --> 51:27.545
Is it alright
if Youssef comes with me'?

51:27.584 --> 51:29.814
No, I have to take his deposition.

51:34.524 --> 51:37.755
Please, I don't want to get in the car
alone with them.

51:37.794 --> 51:40.661
You came to complain,
you must trust us.

51:40.697 --> 51:42.290
Can you take me'?

51:42.332 --> 51:45.097
No, everyone has their own job.

51:45.669 --> 51:49.435
You want us to arrest them, right'?
I must start an investigation.

51:53.877 --> 51:55.845
OK, come with me.

51:55.879 --> 51:57.438
Don't worry.

51:57.481 --> 52:00.416
You'll be escorted by Chedly.
He'll take care of you.

52:02.452 --> 52:05.752
They are a gang
impersonating police officers.

52:08.892 --> 52:11.190
Can I go to the toilet'?

52:11.228 --> 52:13.595
Try to wait
until the doctor sees you.

52:18.335 --> 52:21.771
- She took your complaint'?
- They're taking me to the doctor.

52:21.805 --> 52:23.239
Please come with me.

52:23.273 --> 52:25.640
- Where'?
- I'll be taking your deposition.

52:25.675 --> 52:27.370
- Now'?
- When, then'?

52:27.410 --> 52:30.436
Faiza, I'll take care of his complaint.

52:30.480 --> 52:31.914
I started already.

52:32.149 --> 52:33.913
- Let me take it.
- I've started!

52:34.151 --> 52:35.380
I said I'll do it.

52:35.418 --> 52:37.546
Can you just decide'?

52:37.587 --> 52:40.488
Can't you see she is pregnant'?
Come with me.

52:42.792 --> 52:45.659
- Can't I go with her'?
- She's safe.

52:45.695 --> 52:47.254
OK, come with me.

53:00.510 --> 53:03.207
The veil is a bit dirty
but that's all we have.

53:03.246 --> 53:05.908
Here, put it on and come outside.

53:08.552 --> 53:10.520
Don't let them make you
change your mind.

53:12.556 --> 53:14.251
I'll be waiting for you.

53:14.291 --> 53:15.383
Please, this way.

53:19.563 --> 53:21.190
Hurry UP-

53:21.231 --> 53:23.199
Chedly, wait, I'm coming with you.

53:32.842 --> 53:36.210
Move it! This way!

53:36.580 --> 53:37.775
Hi, sweetheart!

53:41.284 --> 53:42.342
Shut it!

53:56.399 --> 53:58.333
Let's just take her
and then come back.

53:59.636 --> 54:00.694
Come on, get in.

54:01.838 --> 54:03.806
Shall we get the door, Milady'?

54:03.840 --> 54:05.239
What's wrong with you'?

54:05.275 --> 54:07.710
Look at her...
Hey, I'm talking to you.

54:07.744 --> 54:09.303
Come on, get inside.

54:11.514 --> 54:12.948
What's wrong with her'?

54:13.683 --> 54:15.777
- I'm talking to you!
- Come here!

54:15.819 --> 54:18.481
My cell phone... my bag!

54:19.356 --> 54:21.950
Please, help me open the car!

54:22.859 --> 54:24.418
My phone... my bag!

54:24.461 --> 54:25.724
What are you looking for'?

54:25.762 --> 54:29.460
She's totally lost it!

54:29.499 --> 54:31.695
That's my bag!

54:31.735 --> 54:33.533
Hey, what are you doing here'?

54:33.570 --> 54:35.538
What's going on'?

54:37.507 --> 54:38.804
Leave me alone!

55:10.073 --> 55:13.338
- Drop the stick!
- Let go of me!

55:13.643 --> 55:15.577
You've lost your mind!

55:30.660 --> 55:32.560
Wait, I'll call you back.

55:32.595 --> 55:35.565
- Madame, I was in the parking lot...
- Where is Chedly'?

55:36.032 --> 55:38.626
- Where is he'?
- My phone... this is my bag!

55:38.668 --> 55:40.762
- I don't understand.
- In the car!

55:40.804 --> 55:42.738
Why are you here'?

55:42.772 --> 55:44.672
- Those guys...
- Where is Chedly'?

55:44.708 --> 55:46.574
My bag was in their car!

55:46.609 --> 55:49.738
- What are you talking about?
- Shut your mouth, you liar!

55:52.982 --> 55:54.643
Keep quiet everybody!

55:55.385 --> 55:56.910
Say it again, slowly!

55:58.988 --> 56:01.958
Madame, this is my bag.
I told you about it.

56:01.991 --> 56:04.085
What bag'? Didn't she...

56:04.127 --> 56:06.061
My bag was in their car.

56:06.096 --> 56:10.624
What's she talking about'?
What's she accusing us of'?

56:10.667 --> 56:11.896
Isvvear I'll...

56:11.935 --> 56:13.562
Please, Madame...

56:17.941 --> 56:18.999
Yes.

56:20.009 --> 56:21.408
True.

56:22.846 --> 56:24.541
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

56:27.517 --> 56:28.678
Absolutely.

56:29.919 --> 56:33.150
Give me the handcuffs.
Are you accusing us'?

56:33.390 --> 56:35.688
Do you want to get arrested'?

56:35.725 --> 56:38.922
- Give me your hand!
- No, you bastard!

56:38.962 --> 56:41.988
Madame, please...

56:42.031 --> 56:44.466
Please, arrest them!

56:54.511 --> 56:56.570
Get on the seat.

56:59.716 --> 57:01.184
Take your panties off first.

57:03.153 --> 57:06.817
- I'm not wearing any.
- That's OK, come over here.

57:06.856 --> 57:08.449
Please, Mariam.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.021
There you go.

57:18.101 --> 57:22.060
Relax, take it easy!
It vvill be fine.

57:22.839 --> 57:24.807
Everything will be fine.

57:24.841 --> 57:26.536
Give me your leg.

57:27.210 --> 57:28.905
Let's put a leg over here.

57:29.746 --> 57:31.612
The other leg, now.

57:35.885 --> 57:38.149
No! That way I can't work.

57:38.188 --> 57:41.556
Take your hands away
and put them over here.

57:41.591 --> 57:43.582
Over here, Mariam.

57:45.495 --> 57:49.659
Lie back and relax, please.

57:50.667 --> 57:52.032
Don't move.

57:53.603 --> 57:54.798
Open your legs.

57:56.072 --> 57:57.506
Your hands.

57:59.776 --> 58:01.073
Don't move.

58:24.801 --> 58:26.565
Relax, Mariam.

58:54.631 --> 58:57.191
What's this'?
You can't let him in here!

58:57.233 --> 59:00.726
Go out, right now!
Where do you think you are'?

59:00.770 --> 59:03.171
Doctor, is this her first time'?

59:03.206 --> 59:05.937
You want to know'?
Why don't you take my place?

59:05.975 --> 59:09.570
- Don't you have any shame'?
- Take it easy, doctor.

59:09.612 --> 59:12.946
- Get out!
- No need to get upset.

59:16.252 --> 59:19.586
- What's the official version'?
- Don't touch me!

59:19.622 --> 59:21.249
Wait for the medical report.

59:21.291 --> 59:24.659
But you can see it,
no need for a report.

59:24.694 --> 59:26.856
Wait for the report.

59:39.309 --> 59:42.006
Where are you going'?
Are you running away'?

59:42.779 --> 59:45.111
We have to go back to the station.

59:45.148 --> 59:48.140
- I need to change my dress.
- Change your dress'?

59:48.184 --> 59:51.176
Where are you going to change it'?
Are you going home'?

59:51.220 --> 59:53.917
If you start something,
you have to finish it.

59:53.957 --> 59:56.255
You start an affair
and then you back down'?

59:57.293 --> 01:00:00.957
You have to see this through.
Don't give up your rights.

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:03.829
Did Lamjed ask you to go home'?

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:06.965
Are you leaving, Miss'?

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:09.071
Could you at least let us know'?

01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:11.799
Do you want to go home'?

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:14.174
We can give you a ride.

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:17.043
- Where to'? She's not going home.
- Yes, she is!

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.777
Get off me!
The dorm guard won't open the door.

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:21.944
For the police, all doors are open.

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:25.250
Aren't you ashamed of spying on me
with the doctor'?

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:28.918
Spying'? I don't need to.
Move, you little tart!

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.392
Where would she go'?

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:33.619
This is an investigation.
She must sign the report.

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:36.894
- She wants to go.
- She wants to file a complaint.

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:38.924
- She's going.
- To file a complaint!

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:42.302
She must go home.
If we need her, we'll call her.

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:44.204
Let's drive her to the station.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.266
Listen to me. Let me do my job.

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:50.871
I have to clean up
the mess you made at the station.

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:54.975
Even if she wants to drop it,
she has to go back to the station.

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:58.716
She needs to sign a waiver
so we'll all be covered.

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:01.750
Are you going to drop it'?

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:04.725
Are you waiving the case'?

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:10.291
- I want to change my dress.
- Go hang yourself instead!

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:13.234
What happened to the girl'?

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:21.110
Kais, Al Farabi dormitory.

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:28.079
Get in, Your Majesty.

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:30.176
Lamjed, leave the girl alone.

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.981
Do you like her'?
Are you in love'?

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.751
Stop it and get inside.

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:07.755
Did they check her ID card
now that she found her bag'?

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:10.088
I don't know. I don't think so.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.225
Don't think so'?

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:14.319
Let me see your ID card.

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:17.400
I'm talking to you!
Give me your ID!

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:24.872
Where is it'?

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:28.238
What is this'?

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:32.746
An amulet! That's cute!

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.281
So, is this keeping you safe'?

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:39.218
An amulet!

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.319
And what's this'?

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.425
Isn't he a colleague'?

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:48.962
- Army'?
- Yes, army.

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:51.897
Who is this'? Your boyfriend'?

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:54.827
- That's my brother.
- Yeah right!

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:57.197
We'll see.

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:04.538
You're a hillbilly
trying to act like a city girl'?

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.215
Are you ashamed of your accent'?

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.878
Give me the ID card.

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:12.081
Are you going to make
a copy right now'?

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:13.989
Here, take your bag.

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:52.455
Did you know'?

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:55.931
She walks around without any panties.

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:59.265
- You could at least wax.
- You bastard!

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:00.963
- Leave me alone!
- Settle down!

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:03.199
- Pack it in, Lamjed!
- Come here.

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:04.604
It's the dorm, stop here.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:08.209
- The station'll say to bring her back!
- Fine! I understand!

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:10.838
Stop making decisions on your own!

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.507
Sit down and don't move.

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:15.917
Yes, Mr Hedi. I'm listening.

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:18.577
- Don't move!
- Open the door!

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:20.248
Don't let her go.

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:22.519
L-low do you open this door'?
Open!

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:27.156
Let me go, I'm dropping it!

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:28.391
Yes, I'm listening.

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:49.345
<i>GIRLS' DORMITORY.</i>

01:04:58.194 --> 01:04:59.457
Come on, Najla...

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:31.050
Najla, please!

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:08.429
I just saw a shadow over there.

01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:10.994
It could be my daughter.

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:17.433
Who's this'?

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:19.498
What are you doing here'?

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:22.242
- Who are you'?
- Police!

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.713
Police'? Ls everything fine'?

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:28.047
Nothing to report.

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:29.675
Everything is fine.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:32.120
- We are counting on you.
- Good night.

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:33.315
May God help you.

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:37.655
Are you dropping the charges'?
I'm talking to you!

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:38.626
Sir!

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:41.096
No, no please! I will!

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:43.622
If you hear anything, just call us.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.065
Good night.

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:48.665
Get up.

01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:50.399
- Get up.
- Let go!

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:52.430
Get in the van.

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:53.533
Come on.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.009
Move!

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:52.535
I have the video
from the surveillance camera.

01:07:53.169 --> 01:07:57.231
I will share it on Facebook,
it's useless to hand it to them.

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:08.240
Youssef, can I ask you something'?

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:15.322
If you had a video
that showed them raping me,

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:17.154
would you share it on Facebook'?

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:19.627
- Did they film you'?
- No, but let's suppose.

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:27.300
- Do you know zombie films'?
- Yes, but I'm not a fan.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.602
You should watch them.

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:32.330
My whole life is a zombie movie.

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:37.442
The walking dead run after me,
trying to bite me.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.439
I'm trying to save myself.

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.250
Sometimes, I getaway,

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:44.377
and sometimes, they get close to me.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.252
I might let them eat me.

01:08:46.287 --> 01:08:48.620
I'll become a zombie and rest.

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:52.786
If I ever share such a video
on Facebook,

01:08:54.395 --> 01:08:56.125
you should be worried.

01:08:56.165 --> 01:08:57.894
I'll have become a zombie.

01:09:03.872 --> 01:09:07.366
I wish we'd met in better circumstances.

01:09:07.408 --> 01:09:08.843
Too bad.

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:10.368
Iamjinxed.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:19.586
<i>Youssef Dawn,
you are under arrest</i>

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.783
for assaulting a public servant.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:23.553
Don't touch her.

01:09:23.591 --> 01:09:27.323
So now you're qualified!
And you hit yourself too!

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:30.229
- Tell it to the judge.
- You're the law!

01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:33.702
I should've let the guys beat you up
at the Kasbah sit-in!

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:36.667
You're a worthless piece of shit!

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.640
- Where are you taking me'?
- To jail.

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:41.769
The whole country is a jail.

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:45.545
Don't let them scare you,
don't give up your rights.

01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:46.844
They can't do anything.

01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:49.715
Go on, move!
Take his phone away!

01:09:57.893 --> 01:09:59.622
Let go, let go!

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:17.813
- Who is it'?
- Who's there'?

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:19.541
- Madame?
- Mariam'?

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:22.574
- Are you alone'?
- Mariam, unlock the door.

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:23.710
Open up!

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:25.846
- Are you with them'?
- I'm alone!

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:29.890
- What are you doing here'?
- Please...

01:10:29.925 --> 01:10:32.257
You can't lock yourself in my office.

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:34.991
Instead of arresting them,
you arrested Youssef!

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.926
- Get out.
- Where to'?

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:39.958
I won't!
I don't want to see them anymore.

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:42.869
- Get out and stop shouting.
- I'm not leaving.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:47.365
- You're not allowed to be here!
- They're outside! They'll get me!

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:48.342
Out.

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:51.642
There's nobody out there.
Come see for yourself.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.775
Come on, take a look.
There's nobody.

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:56.882
Come on now.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.447
Have a seat.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.726
Don't be afraid.
A colleague is coming, OK'?

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:21.305
- Where are you going'?
- Home.

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:22.708
- What do you mean'?
- My place.

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:24.941
Madame, for God's sake...

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:28.610
- I did what I had to do.
- I'm begging you, please...

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:31.985
- I've done my part.
- Don't leave me alone.

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:34.854
I really have to go.

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:38.656
- I'm begging you, please...
- Let go of the bag!

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:43.660
I'm sorry.

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.594
I didn't mean it.

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:52.636
Sorry...

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:08.716
You are a whore.

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:14.495
Please, don't leave me alone.

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:18.391
Please, I'm begging you.

01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:18.418
I just want to talk.
Don't be afraid.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.121
- We need to talk.
- Shut up.

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:22.790
Leave me alone!

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:29.503
Leave me alone!

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:17.483
Hello'?
Madame Nahla Hachani, journalist'?

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:18.884
This is her number, right'?

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:35.733
Madame Nahla'?

01:14:37.539 --> 01:14:41.066
You gave me your number at the hospital,
do you remember me'?

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:45.680
L know it's late,
I'm sorry for calling you now.

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:48.149
I'm at the police station,
behind the Palace.

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:51.118
The two policemen who raped me
are outside.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.212
I locked myself in the toilets.

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:56.019
They arrested the boy who was with me.

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:00.592
No, I don't have a lawyer.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:06.025
Please, don't leave me alone.

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:03.189
Stop! Let me go!

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:09.862
<i>[Let go]</i>

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:14.899
- Listen, child, don't be afraid.
- Don't touch me!

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:17.235
- I have two words for you!
- Enough!

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:20.674
Drop the charges
or this video goes to your family.

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:24.046
Give it to me!

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.141
Take your hands off!

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:44.828
You killed her!

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:48.825
She's not dead.
The bitch is acting.

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:50.065
Up!

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:51.231
Get up!

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.773
Stop it and get out of here!

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:03.305
Wake her up.

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:06.304
Wake her up
so we can all go home.

01:18:08.116 --> 01:18:09.447
Wake up.

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:11.911
Please, wake up.

01:18:12.821 --> 01:18:15.688
Don't be afraid.
We want to help you.

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:17.317
Do you need a doctor'?

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:18.884
Do you want some water'?

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:21.796
We are sorry.

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:25.957
Bad cops. We arrested them.

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:29.699
They have no respect
for the institution they work for.

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:32.969
They will go before
the Police Complaints Board

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:35.136
and they'll get
the harshest sanctions.

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:38.477
- They'll be an example for others.
- No doubt about it.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:42.082
Your phone's ringing.
You can answer it.

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:45.485
Put it on speaker.

01:18:54.963 --> 01:18:57.295
- Hello, Najla'?
- Put the speaker on.

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:02.396
- Mariam, can you hear me?
- Oui.

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:06.064
<i>Where have you</i> been?
<i>I haven 't stopped calling you!</i>

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:10.170
<i>Didn't We</i> agree <i>about the dress
and the bag? I Want them back!</i>

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:14.115
<i>I sew you leaving with that guy.
Did you sleep with him'?</i>

01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:20.413
Answer and tell her
that you'll be back soon.

01:19:26.128 --> 01:19:27.254
Hello, Najla'?

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:30.261
I'm on my way.
No need to call me back.

01:19:33.368 --> 01:19:36.133
Will you release Youssef'?
He didn't do anything.

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:38.503
You're worried about him'?

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:42.477
A real man wouldn't have left
a cute girl like you alone with 2 guys.

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:45.208
- He didn't have any choice.
- Yes he did!

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:47.215
He should have fought for you.

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:50.412
He went to get money
from a nonexistent account.

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:54.821
Did you know that your Youssef
has no bank account?

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:56.551
Sign this.

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:58.282
No bank account'?

01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:00.920
It's a set up. He was using you.

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:04.455
He's using you
to stain the reputation of the police.

01:20:04.499 --> 01:20:05.898
Sign this, please.

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:07.459
What is Youssef setting up'?

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:12.136
Don't answer her. State secrets.

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:13.573
Here, sign this.

01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:21.475
This is a waiver!

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:23.041
What did you expect'?

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:27.521
- You told Lamjed you were dropping it.
- I'll never give you that satisfaction.

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:30.491
What's going on here'?
Aren't we going home'?

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:32.254
You were going to drop it!

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:35.389
No! I want to see them
in jail like dogs!

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.364
We told you we arrested them!

01:20:38.066 --> 01:20:40.296
And they'll go before the judge'?

01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:42.167
Judge and court,

01:20:42.204 --> 01:20:45.230
eyewitnesses and investigation...

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:48.538
Such a case will take at least
three years of your life.

01:20:48.577 --> 01:20:51.877
You will be going
from court house to court house.

01:20:51.913 --> 01:20:55.850
Have you got somewhere to stay
apart from the dorms'?

01:20:56.918 --> 01:20:59.319
If there's a session
during the holidays,

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:02.380
how will you get to court'?
Public transport'?

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:03.983
And your family'?

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:09.593
A case like this needs a lawyer.

01:21:09.631 --> 01:21:11.599
A bigshot lawyer!

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:17.134
That will cost a lot.
Do you have any money'?

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:19.266
Can you pay him'?

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:21.906
Not to mention the scandal.

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:24.242
That's the worst part.

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:27.180
You and your family will be pointed at.

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:31.216
What man will accept you then'?

01:21:31.253 --> 01:21:34.188
Please, have a seat.

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:40.088
Here, sign here and let's all go home.

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:42.393
I'm not signing.

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:45.559
Think about it.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.534
I want to press charges.

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:49.461
Very well.

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:53.305
Let her sign her deposition
and we can all go home.

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:04.018
Give me a cigarette.

01:22:06.554 --> 01:22:07.953
Lighter.

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:09.983
Have a cigarette.

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:12.951
You can smoke here. Enjoy it.

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:15.125
Here, smoke!

01:22:15.163 --> 01:22:16.324
Go on!

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:18.560
What is this'?

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.399
What do you mean'?
It's your deposition.

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:25.430
You want me to sign
for things I didn't say'?

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:28.636
Don't you have any decency'?
Any limits'?

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:31.009
You're throwing it in my face'?

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:37.180
I would rather die than sign this.

01:22:38.386 --> 01:22:39.478
Very well.

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:46.158
Madame,
in that case we're staying here.

01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:47.389
We're staying.

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:50.722
OK.

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:55.261
This is the report.

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:58.603
What don't you agree with
in this statement?

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:04.544
You wrote I was committing adultery
with Youssef when the police came.

01:23:04.579 --> 01:23:07.276
That's not true'?
You spoke about adultery!

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:10.148
They said I was married,
that he was my boyfriend,

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:11.744
and this was called adultery.

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:16.185
Why would they say that if you weren't
in a compromising position'?

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:19.194
To scare me with prison,
but they're the criminals!

01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:22.629
We know what they did.
They've been arrested.

01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:25.225
What does that mean'?

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:28.397
What are you up to'?

01:23:28.436 --> 01:23:30.427
Where is this going'?

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:33.503
You should be ashamed of yourselves!

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:36.670
So I'm dishonest
and I fabricate evidence'?

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:38.110
Great!

01:23:38.146 --> 01:23:41.446
Mounir, it's OK. Be patient.

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:43.315
She's just a kid.

01:23:44.252 --> 01:23:46.220
Forgive her.

01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:48.179
I'll do it for you.

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:50.351
Very well.

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:52.754
You don't like the report'?

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:55.561
We'll start again.

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:57.725
But first, we'll tear this one up.

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.699
Here's your report.

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:04.734
Chedly, start a new one,

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:08.607
and let's see
if the beauty queen is satisfied.

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:11.142
Here vve go again.

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:18.220
But I ask the questions
and you answer them.

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:19.311
Question:

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:23.222
What where you doing with Youssef
when the police car stopped?

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.655
We were... walking on the beach.

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:30.831
No.

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:37.231
Your "fiancé" Youssef told us
you were in a more intimate position.

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:41.198
You might say... much warmer.

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:43.336
Answer him!

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:46.204
We were kissing.

01:24:46.247 --> 01:24:48.272
They were kissing!

01:24:48.316 --> 01:24:51.650
They were all over each other,
tongues and all!

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:55.850
Write down:
"We were found in an indecent position,"

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:58.253
"committing an act of obscenity"

01:24:58.293 --> 01:25:01.228
"in an obvious affront
to public decency."

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:02.388
Affront to decency'?

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:05.559
According to the law,
that's how we found you.

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:09.262
Do you have a problem
with the law of the land'?

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:14.539
- A kiss is an affront to decency'?
- You think you're in a soap opera'?

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:18.672
Madame, the law punishes
with a jail sentence of six months

01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:21.148
and a fine of one thousand dinars

01:25:21.182 --> 01:25:24.777
anybody practicing indecent acts
and upsetting public morals,

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:26.617
whether by act or by speech,

01:25:26.654 --> 01:25:30.284
or anybody disturbing
others with acts...

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:33.724
of immorality.

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:35.195
The text is clear.

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:45.570
Don't write "obscenity",
write "small kiss".

01:25:45.607 --> 01:25:47.234
Aren't you ashamed'?

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:49.869
You're telling us what to write'?

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:52.243
You're telling us how to do our job'?

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.408
You've got some nerve!

01:25:54.449 --> 01:25:56.747
You're out of control!

01:25:56.784 --> 01:25:59.776
Lam going to call your father!

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:02.286
Leave my father out of this.

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:04.553
Press charges
without telling your father'?

01:26:04.592 --> 01:26:06.151
Please...

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:09.630
All these numbers are guys.
Kids having fun!

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:11.428
What's your father's name'?

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:14.362
What's his name'?

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:18.239
It's ringing.

01:26:18.773 --> 01:26:22.471
Your father is probably getting ready
for the morning prayer.

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:24.911
Unless the poor man is up
milking his cows.

01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:29.577
Mister Ahmed'?

01:26:30.318 --> 01:26:31.547
This is the police!

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.651
We have your daughter...

01:26:39.827 --> 01:26:41.192
Bravo.

01:26:45.466 --> 01:26:46.695
Congratulations.

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:48.733
You are a smart girl.

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:52.872
Do you have a brain
or are you a kamikaze'? Tell me!

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:55.535
Do you have a brain
or are you a kamikaze'?

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:58.808
I dialed a false number
to spare your father.

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:02.476
If he hears about this,
he'll have a heart attack.

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:04.679
He'll die.

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:06.380
Then you...

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.720
you'll be cursed forever!

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:27.272
Mariam.

01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:32.007
Do you still want to press charges'?

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:37.543
You are absolutely right.

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:49.529
If I want to press charges,
my family must know.

01:27:49.564 --> 01:27:53.023
No need to threaten me with my father,
I will call him myself.

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.298
Yes, it's Mariam.

01:28:29.837 --> 01:28:34.297
Daddy, I am at the police station
behind The Palace Hotel.

01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:36.972
Can you come'?

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:42.744
I'll tell you when you get here.

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:51.486
Daddy, hurry UP-

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.824
They're frightening me.

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:10.040
Arrest her.

01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:12.905
<i>Me'?</i>

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:16.480
What do you mean'?

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:19.418
You did well to call your father.

01:29:21.956 --> 01:29:23.924
In a situation like this,

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:27.018
you will need your family.

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:29.388
To back you up.

01:29:30.431 --> 01:29:32.365
I tried to help you, Mariam.

01:29:32.867 --> 01:29:34.596
I really did.

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:37.600
I wanted to offer you a way out.

01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:39.470
But you're stubborn.

01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:44.108
You're on a wild ride
and I have no choice but to arrest you.

01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:51.419
Arrest me'?

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:55.454
Why would you arrest me'?

01:29:57.024 --> 01:30:00.426
Why are you playing with my nerves'?

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:04.064
Why of all girls
are you picking on me'?

01:30:04.766 --> 01:30:05.927
Why'?

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:10.732
You threw Youssef in a pit
and you want me to join him'?

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:13.940
Why? What did I do to you'?

01:30:15.009 --> 01:30:16.670
Look at me...

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:17.735
Just look!

01:30:20.047 --> 01:30:23.039
But you won't get away with it.

01:30:23.684 --> 01:30:26.813
I don't know anybody,
I don't have any support,

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:28.652
but God exists.

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:32.558
The truth will come out.
Because I'm not giving up.

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:37.022
I'll have revenge
for everything you've done to me.

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:40.467
You'll pay a thousand times over.

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:43.937
For staining my body and my honor.

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:49.535
Chedly,

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:51.605
get her a glass of water.

01:30:52.213 --> 01:30:55.012
Help her,
she's having a breakdown.

01:31:04.859 --> 01:31:06.588
Here, wash your face.

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:08.493
Stay away from me.

01:31:08.529 --> 01:31:09.928
Stay away.

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:13.725
Mariam...

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:16.999
Calm down.

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:23.769
Let me be very honest with you.

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:28.880
A story like yours could
put the country in jeopardy.

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:32.884
It could open hell's gates in our face.

01:31:34.222 --> 01:31:35.917
Do you love Tunisia'?

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:38.993
Tell me,

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:40.994
do you love our beautiful Tunisia'?

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:45.098
We have a historical responsibility

01:31:45.132 --> 01:31:48.500
to assure the security
and stability of the country.

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:51.801
Do you know who that man is'?

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:54.236
Do you know him'?

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:56.869
We are the ones
keeping the wolves at bay

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:59.243
so they don't devour us.

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:02.175
If the police disappear tomorrow,

01:32:02.216 --> 01:32:06.778
me, you, my brother, my sister,

01:32:06.821 --> 01:32:08.789
your mother, my kids...

01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:12.123
They will be raped and the country too.

01:32:12.693 --> 01:32:14.525
It will be chaos.

01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:18.833
And the country will become
a haven for terrorists,

01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:22.825
thieves, militias and gangs.

01:32:25.773 --> 01:32:26.831
Tell me,

01:32:27.241 --> 01:32:29.733
can a country survive without police'?

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:32.973
Can you imagine Tunisia
surviving without police'?

01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:37.745
The country is in turmoil
and you want to press charges?

01:32:40.688 --> 01:32:42.213
Help me, Mariam,

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:45.055
so I can help you
control this whole story.

01:32:46.193 --> 01:32:49.788
I'll find you a way out
and everyone will be safe.

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:55.025
I won't help you.
I have no reason to help you.

01:32:58.306 --> 01:32:59.967
Think about it.

01:33:04.879 --> 01:33:06.108
What do you say'?

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:10.607
Go ahead.
If you want to arrest me, do it.

01:33:10.952 --> 01:33:13.649
I've been through everything tonight.

01:33:14.655 --> 01:33:18.216
You've trampled my dignity
and ripped it to pieces.

01:33:19.927 --> 01:33:22.328
Help yourself to what's left.

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:27.164
Put me in jail. At least in a hole,
I won't have to see anybody.

01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:38.973
Arrest her so we can all go home.

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:46.084
Sorry but...

01:33:47.388 --> 01:33:49.789
I need an order
from the public prosecutor.

01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:50.950
What?

01:33:51.392 --> 01:33:53.019
What are you talking about'?

01:33:55.096 --> 01:33:57.087
Where are you going'?

01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:59.259
You can refuse to sign the report.

01:33:59.867 --> 01:34:03.701
They're just trying to frighten you.

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:05.206
They cannot arrest you.

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.707
I will write that you refused
to sign the report.

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:12.008
You should go straight
to the public prosecutor's office.

01:34:12.046 --> 01:34:13.912
- What you are saying'?
- Get off me.

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:15.347
Hurry UP!

01:34:15.383 --> 01:34:18.353
- Have you gone mad'?
- Go! Now!

01:34:18.386 --> 01:34:22.118
Where is she going'?
What's wrong with you'?

01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:26.184
- Stop acting like a hero!
- Get your hands off me!

01:34:26.227 --> 01:34:28.093
There are laws in this country!

01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:29.824
What laws are you talking about'?

01:34:30.305 --> 01:34:36.905
