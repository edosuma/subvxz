- ERNESTINE: Daddy, I got it.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.671
So you saw
my big-headed boy today?

17:16.760 --> 17:21.039
Yeah. He's fine.
He sends his love.

17:21.119 --> 17:23.156
Now, they ain't bein'
too hard on him, is they?

17:23.240 --> 17:24.880
Now I ask you like that
because, you know,

17:24.960 --> 17:27.555
he may say things to you
he won't say to me.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.871
ALICE:
Lovers' secrets?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.959
Well, he hates it,
you can see that.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.032
- And he should.
- Come on.

17:36.120 --> 17:39.431
But... he's strong.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.751
He'll be all right.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.116
But we gotta get him
out of there.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.954
If he'd done his reading
and his studying when he should have,

17:47.040 --> 17:48.759
he wouldn't be in there
in the first place.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.554
- Girl, what you know about it?
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

17:51.640 --> 17:53.836
I got some gin
and we got some whisky

17:53.920 --> 17:55.434
and we got some cognac.

17:55.520 --> 17:58.354
(chuckles)
We ain't got no Thunderbird, though.

17:58.440 --> 18:01.512
- I hope you ladies don't mind.
- Mind?

18:01.640 --> 18:04.109
Frank does not care
if we mind.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.795
SHARON: Well, Mrs. Hunt,
what can I get you, sugar?

18:06.880 --> 18:10.317
I can offer you coffee, tea...

18:10.440 --> 18:12.193
ice cream, Coca-Cola.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.976
- Coca-Cola.
- ERNESTINE: I got it, Mama.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.912
How about an ice cream soda,
Mrs. Hunt?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.434
I can do that for you.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.638
Sheila, why don't you help me?

18:23.200 --> 18:24.270
Come on.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.391
- Oh, Lord! Time flies.
- Yeah.

18:29.480 --> 18:32.040
SHARON: I haven't seen you
since all this trouble started.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.840
Girl, don't say a word.

18:34.920 --> 18:38.231
I've been runnin' myself sick
all up and down the Bronx,

18:38.320 --> 18:40.915
trying to get the very best
legal advice I can find.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.357
I just pray and I pray and I pray

18:45.440 --> 18:47.096
that the Lord will bring my boy
to the light.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.998
- That's all I pray for.
- Mm.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.878
ALICE:
Every day and every night.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.270
And then sometimes,

18:53.400 --> 18:56.120
sometimes I think
this might be the Lord's plan

18:56.200 --> 18:58.920
to get my boy
to think on his sins...

19:00.240 --> 19:02.709
and surrender his soul
to Jesus.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.235
SHARON:
Yeah, you might be right.

19:06.320 --> 19:09.074
The Lord sure works
in mysterious ways.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.436
Oh, yes, He does.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.955
Now, He may try you,

19:14.040 --> 19:16.680
but He ain't never left
none of His children alone.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.834
What do you think about
that lawyer Ernestine found?

19:20.920 --> 19:23.037
Um, that boy Hayward?

19:26.360 --> 19:27.840
I ain't met him yet.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.594
I just ain't had time
to get downtown yet.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.829
I know Frank saw him.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.991
What do you think about him, Frank?

19:40.960 --> 19:44.510
He's a white boy, been to law school,
got them degrees.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.920
I ain't got to tell you what
that mean. It don't mean shit.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.117
You're talkin' to a woman.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.396
I'm hip.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.790
And it's a mighty welcome change.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.713
- Uh...
- Like I was sayin'...

19:58.840 --> 20:02.356
It don't mean shit.
I ain't sure we gonna stay with him.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.000
On the other hand,
as white boys go, he's not so bad.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.833
He's young and hungry,

20:06.920 --> 20:09.640
so he's not as full of shit now
as he may be when he's full.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.679
- Hmm.
- ALICE: I keep tryin' to tell you.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.719
It's that negative attitude.
You so full of hate.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.872
If you give people hatred,
they give it back to you.

20:18.960 --> 20:22.431
Every time I hear you talk like that,
it breaks my heart

20:22.520 --> 20:25.433
knowin' my boy is locked up
in some dungeon

20:25.520 --> 20:28.080
that only the love of God
will get him out of.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.517
Now, Alice, I don't think that
Frank was talkin' about hate.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.239
He was just speakin' on the truth.

20:33.320 --> 20:34.913
ALICE:
Well, I trust in God.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.074
I know He cares for me.

20:38.160 --> 20:41.836
Mr. Rivers, what exactly
is the purpose of this meeting?

20:41.920 --> 20:43.559
You didn't call us all the way over here

20:43.640 --> 20:45.916
just to watch my father insult my mother.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.639
TISH:
Why not?

20:47.720 --> 20:49.234
It's Saturday night.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.835
Can't tell what folks won't do
if they get bored enough.

20:53.200 --> 20:57.274
Maybe we just invited you over
to liven things up.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.756
I can believe you're that malicious,

20:59.840 --> 21:01.877
but I can't believe you're that stupid.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.599
- (clears throat)
- JOSEPH: Uh, um...

21:03.680 --> 21:07.230
Let me go check on that,
um, ice cream float.

21:07.320 --> 21:10.279
(laughing)

21:10.360 --> 21:12.795
Uh-huh. Pedrocito.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.600
(speaking in Spanish)

21:15.680 --> 21:16.680
Good to see you.

21:16.720 --> 21:19.713
(both speaking in Spanish)

21:21.520 --> 21:24.115
(Pedrocito speaking Spanish)

21:24.200 --> 21:26.556
PEDROCITO:
How can I help you, senorita?

21:26.680 --> 21:30.196
I'm sorry your company tonight
is less than desirable,

21:30.280 --> 21:33.671
but, sadly, that cannot be helped.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.399
(speaking in Spanish)

21:35.520 --> 21:37.989
(Fonny, Pedrocito laughing)

21:38.080 --> 21:39.514
TISH:
<i>I had never seen Fonny</i>

21:39.600 --> 21:41.478
<i>outside the world in which I moved.</i>

21:41.560 --> 21:43.870
<i>I had seen him with his father
and his mother,</i>

21:43.960 --> 21:46.520
<i>and I had seen him with us.</i>

21:46.600 --> 21:49.513
<i>I had certainly never seen him
in the world in which he moved.</i>

21:50.760 --> 21:53.229
(rain pattering)

21:53.320 --> 21:56.518
<i>Perhaps it was only now
I was able to see him with me...</i>

21:57.840 --> 22:00.309
<i>because even though he was turned away
from me laughing...</i>

22:03.440 --> 22:05.318
<i>he was holdin' my hand.</i>

22:06.880 --> 22:08.155
Good night.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.473
FONNY:
Tish?

22:26.560 --> 22:28.472
TISH:
Yeah?

22:29.640 --> 22:31.472
Come and see my place,
won't you?

22:32.480 --> 22:33.880
TISH:
But it's late.

22:34.880 --> 22:35.996
FONNY:
It ain't far.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.232
Okay, Fonny.

22:51.440 --> 22:52.669
Okay.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.954
what I had to tell Fonny today.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.791
What I had to tell Fonny today is...

24:04.760 --> 24:06.433
Fonny's gonna be a father.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.032
We're gonna have a baby.

24:14.360 --> 24:17.956
You and me,
we fixin' to go out and get drunk.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.191

Oh, I'm glad.
Don't worry, I'm mighty glad.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.760
And who's gonna be responsible
for this baby?

24:29.840 --> 24:32.036
The father and the mother.

24:32.120 --> 24:35.079
You can bet it won't be
the Holy damn Ghost.

24:39.080 --> 24:42.278
I guess you call your lustful action love.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.350
ALICE:
I don't.

24:46.440 --> 24:49.717
I always knew you'd be
the destruction of my son.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.636
The Bible says,
"Put to death, therefore,

24:53.760 --> 24:56.150
- all that is earthly in you."
- (Frank sighs)

24:56.240 --> 24:58.755
"Sexual immorality,

24:58.840 --> 25:02.754
"impurity, passion,

25:02.840 --> 25:05.833
evil desire, covetousness."

25:05.920 --> 25:08.560
That child was born of sin,

25:08.640 --> 25:10.199
and the Holy Ghost is gonna cause it

25:10.320 --> 25:11.356
to shrivel in your womb.

25:11.440 --> 25:14.194
But my son,
my son will be forgiven.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.590
- My prayers...
- O h!

25:16.680 --> 25:18.478
- Oh.
- SHEILA: Mama.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.153
- JOSEPH: Frank!
- Her heart!

25:20.240 --> 25:22.072
I think you'll find it's still pumpin',

25:22.160 --> 25:24.311
but I wouldn't call it no heart!

25:24.400 --> 25:27.154
Help me, help her.
Come on, Mama, come on.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.596
Joe, let the women take care of her, man.
Come on!

25:29.680 --> 25:32.593
Joseph. Joseph, go on.
Go on, we don't need you here.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.478
- All right, all right.
- FRANK: Come on.

25:34.560 --> 25:35.994
It's okay, you got it.
I got you.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.312
JOSEPH:
Frank. Frank!

25:40.920 --> 25:44.118
(panting)

25:46.160 --> 25:47.753
ADRIENNE:
Okay. You're okay.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.071
That was a terrible thing
you said to me.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.914
That was the most terrible thing
I've heard in all my life.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.559
My father didn't have to slap her.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.360
- She's got a weak heart.
- She got a weak head.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.035
The Holy Ghost must have
softened your brain, child.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.480
Did she forget that that was

26:01.560 --> 26:04.029
Frank's grandchild she was cursin'?

26:04.120 --> 26:06.715
I don't think you have the right
to sneer at my mother's faith.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.519
ERNESTINE:
Oh, don't give me that bullshit.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.637
You so ashamed to have
a Holy Roller for a mother,

26:10.720 --> 26:13.189
you don't know what to do.
Y'all make me sick!

26:13.280 --> 26:15.511
And who do you funky niggers
think you are?

26:15.600 --> 26:17.876
She only asked one question.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.839
Who is going to raise this baby?
And who is?

26:20.920 --> 26:22.354
Tish ain't got no education,

26:22.440 --> 26:24.557
and God knows,
she ain't got nothin' else.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.518
Fonny ain't never been
worth a damn.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.751
So who is going to raise
this baby?

26:28.840 --> 26:31.150
I am, you dried-up,
yellow cunt!

26:31.240 --> 26:33.880
And you keep on talkin',
I'll take mighty good care of you.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.600
Adrienne, baby!

26:37.480 --> 26:39.392
Can I tell you somethin',
sweetie?

26:39.480 --> 26:41.472
Ever since the first day
I laid eyes

26:41.560 --> 26:44.871
on your very fine person,

26:44.960 --> 26:48.351
I got caught up in your Adam's apple.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.080
Oh, I've been dreamin' about it.

26:51.160 --> 26:54.232
And I can't tell
whether I wanna tear it out

26:54.320 --> 26:56.915
with my fingers or my teeth.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.117
And if you touch my baby sister,

26:59.200 --> 27:01.760
I'm gonna have to make up
my mind real quick.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.319
So touch her.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.392
I knew we shouldn't have come.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.479
Oh, Sheila. I didn't even know
you could say that word.

27:10.560 --> 27:11.835
SHARON:
Ernestine.

27:14.040 --> 27:17.795
ADRIENNE:
Come on, Sheila. Let's go.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.160
- Come on, Mama.
- Come on, Mama.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.440
Just grab her purse. Come on.

27:20.520 --> 27:23.433
Just come on, Mama.
We got you.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.112
Hold her purse. Come on.

27:29.320 --> 27:32.233
- (sniffles)
- Come on, Mama.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.118
I hope you're proud

27:34.200 --> 27:36.920
of how you raised
your daughters.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.754
My girls ain't gonna think of bringing

27:39.840 --> 27:42.514
no bastards home to feed!

27:42.600 --> 27:44.273
I can tell you that!

27:44.360 --> 27:47.558
- That's 'cause won't nobody fuck 'em.
- SHARON: Ernestine.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.234
That child that's comin'...

27:56.600 --> 27:58.114
is your grandchild.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.556
I don't understand you.

28:01.640 --> 28:05.190
It's your grandchild.

28:05.280 --> 28:08.159
What difference does it make
how it gets here?

28:08.240 --> 28:10.994
The child ain't got nothin'
to do with that.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.073
Ain't none of us got nothin'
to do with that.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.592
That child...

28:18.800 --> 28:20.678
That child...

28:23.480 --> 28:25.358
- That child...
- Come on, let's go, Mama.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.352
- Go on home.
- That child...

28:27.440 --> 28:31.036
(sobbing)
That child, that child...

28:31.120 --> 28:33.032
Get your shit!

28:33.120 --> 28:34.679

40:24.440 --> 40:26.830

we had ourselves a loft.

47:42.440 --> 47:44.033
Cat had promised it to her.

47:44.120 --> 47:46.635
- Okay.
- But he hadn't seen me.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.791
Oh... (chuckling)

47:50.320 --> 47:52.516
You know, so he figures,
a black chick way downtown,

47:52.640 --> 47:54.199
looking for a loft all by herself,

47:54.280 --> 47:57.796
- he think he gonna make it with her.
- Really? (laughs)

47:57.880 --> 48:00.315
He thinks she's propositionin' him.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.278
(Daniel sighs)

48:02.400 --> 48:04.392
I mean, that's what he really thinks.

48:05.760 --> 48:07.274

48:08.080 --> 48:11.073
She come back to tell me,
all happy and proud.

48:13.320 --> 48:16.472
We go down there, and sure enough,
when that cat sees me...

48:17.480 --> 48:20.871
he says, "Oh, there's been
some great misunderstanding.

48:22.520 --> 48:24.796
"I can't rent you the loft 'cause I got

48:24.920 --> 48:26.480
"all this family coming in from Romania

48:26.560 --> 48:30.156
in, like, a half-hour
and I gotta give it to 'em."

48:30.240 --> 48:33.233
Shit. I told him he was full of shit.

48:33.320 --> 48:34.754
Yeah.

48:34.840 --> 48:37.036
And then he threatened
to call the cops on my ass.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.576
I'm really gonna have
to figure out a way of getting

48:44.600 --> 48:47.479
some bread together and getting
the fuck out of this country.

48:47.560 --> 48:50.029
Oh, yeah?
How you gonna do that?

48:55.320 --> 48:57.471
I don't know yet.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.119

49:40.400 --> 49:42.790

to the both of us...

49:44.480 --> 49:46.676

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.278
they found Mrs. Rogers,
but she's in Puerto Rico.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.480
Somebody's gotta go
and talk to her.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.711
Which we'll have to pay for.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.756
- Okay.
- Hmm.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.473
So what's the good news?

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.315
You smell nice.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.436
(chuckles)

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.193
That they found her, baby.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:31.034
But how did she get
to Puerto Rico?

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.237
I can't go to Puerto Rico.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.154
Mama and Daddy don't know.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.799
I haven't talked to them yet

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.917
because I wanted
to talk to you first.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.320
Do you think she was really raped?

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.240
Baby sis.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.752
I actually do think she was raped...

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.880
and that she has absolutely
no idea who did it,

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.560
that the man could pass her
on the street

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.632
and she wouldn't even
recognize him.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.877
But why Fonny?

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.873
Because he was presented to her
as the rapist,

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.759
and it was much easier
for her to say yes

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.878
than to try to relive
the whole damn thing.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.351
Oh. Well, what about Daniel?

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.194
Daniel can vouch for us.
Daniel knows Fonny was with him.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.114
And Hayward's gonna
talk to him tomorrow.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.635
He might have been able
to talk to him today.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.671
Some shit.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.280
Yeah.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.913
But we in it now.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.272
(sighs)

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.800
And you, uh, you showed her
the ad, right?

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.637
(lock clacks, door opens)

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:36.277
LEVY: All right, lady and gentleman,
here we are.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.994
Hey, I know it doesn't look
like much right now,

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.470
but, um,
well, we're not done, you see?

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.576
You gotta, you gotta imagine
that there's like walls

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.399
all the way up and down here and...

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.676
I mean, yeah, it's a...
it's a work in progress.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.433
Yeah. See, Tish, it's not done.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.751
It's a work in progress.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.160
Fonny, I'm sorry,

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.472
but how we gonna make this
into a home?

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.599
Look. Look, imagine
there are walls, right?

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.433
Over here and over here.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.512
I mean, see, none of this
is gonna be here.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.751
It's gonna be like
we got our own little space.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.936
And maybe there'll be some
other young folks, over there

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.270
and, and over there,
like a community, right?

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.800
Uh, yeah, a community.
Yeah, sure.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.078
But... where are we gonna cook

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.755
and sleep and bathe?
I mean...

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.150
Where are my mama
and them gonna sit?

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.794
Easy.

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:35.760
Look, I'll put a couch
right over here, huh?

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:39.550
Mama, Daddy, maybe even Ernestine, right?

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.472
And the bed,
I'll put all the way back there,

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.153
right against the wall,

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:47.280
so I can see that pretty light
on your face when the sun rises.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.637
Some of my sculptures over here
and over here.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.791
Right?

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.111
As far as eatin' goes,
I was thinkin'...

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.840
I was thinkin'
we could put a table right here.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.672
What you think?

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.759
I don't know, Fonny.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.035
FONNY:
As far as I'm concerned,

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.157
the only thing
we missin' is a fridge.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.400
But I don't wanna
throw my back out

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.631
before we even have
a chance to make a kid.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.953
Hey, Levy.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:21.351
Come on, give me a, a hand
with this fridge, man.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:24.160
- What, you want me to...
- Yeah, come on, help me out.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.674
Okay.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.958
All right, babe,
I need you to get the door.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.919
Get the door, come on.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.056
- All right. All right. You ready?
- Okay. Yeah, I'm ready.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.080
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.391
- Three, two, one.
- Uh-huh.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.551
Oh, okay, all right.
You good?

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.875
- Yeah, I'm good.
- All right.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.679
- Slowly now. Careful.
- Okay, okay.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.911
All right. Why am I straining
more than you?

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.753
I got you. I got you.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.117
Right on back here.
Right on back here. All right.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.919
- Right here?
- Yeah, right here. Perfect.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.798
(grunting)
Right.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.633
Whoo! Ha!

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.189
Hey, that sure took
a load out of me.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.034
Yeah... me, too.

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.800
But what a man wouldn't do
for love, eh, Levy?

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.995
LEVY:
Amen.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:10.351
Well, thank you for my fridge, boys,

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.433
but don't forget about my stove.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.751
Oh! Oh, yeah, of course not.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.752
Uh, you mind helpin' me out
with the stove?

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.274
- Not at all, no.
- Levy? All right.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.317
We gotta make sure we get that.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.752
LEVY: <i>You don't gotta worry
about your neighbors.</i>

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.354
<i>All you got down here
is sweatshops.</i>

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.951
And the place on the ground
floor, though, it's legit.

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:37.033
So other than it bein' a firetrap,
what's the catch?

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.032
Catch?

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:43.397
I mean, no offense,
Levy, but...

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.993
we've been looking for a long time.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:49.576
Don't seem to me like there's a reason

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.399
to treat two Negros so nice like.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.039
I mean, clearly, we ain't got a pot

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.272
nor much of a drink to make piss with.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.589
Pardon my French.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.831
Look, man, with me,
it's, uh, it's pretty simple.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.516
I... I dig people
who love each other.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.389
Black, white, green, purple,
it doesn't really matter to me.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.279
Just spread the love,
you know?

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.636
- Oh, so you a hippie now?
- (chuckles) No.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.313
I ain't take you for no hippie, man.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:23.470
No, man, I'm, uh...

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:26.951
I don't know,
I'm just my mother's son.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:33.390
You know, sometimes that's all that makes
the difference between us and them.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.277
All right, well, just, uh,
just keep in touch

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:44.750
about gettin'
that deposit together, yeah?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.356
(sighs) Will do.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.434
Will do, Levy.

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:55.749

I'm gonna grab me some smokes

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.395
What we gonna do?

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.392
Well, the first thing we gotta do

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.915
is we gotta stop blaming ourselves.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.710
If we can't do that, man,
we'll never get the boy out

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.757
because he'll be so fucked up.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.240
And we cannot fuck up now, baby,

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.856

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.957
You ever have any money?

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.635
- You ever have any money?
- No.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.632
Then why are you worried
about it now?

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.672
You raised them somehow.

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.399
You fed them somehow,
didn't you?

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.359
If we start worryin'
about the money now...

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.920
then we fucked,
and we'll lose our children.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.079
That white man, baby,

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.470
he want you to be worried
about the money.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.632
That's his whole game.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.360
But if we got to where we are
without the money,

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.760
we can get further.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.151
I ain't worried about their money.

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.197
It don't belong to them anyhow.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.556
They stole it from us.

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.199
They ain't never met nobody

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:04.079
that they didn't lie to and steal from.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.117
Well, I can steal, too.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.510
And rob.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.671
How you think I raised my daughters?

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:15.712
Shit.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.791
And what you think is gonna happen?

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.839
- What we make happen.
- Man, that's easy to say.

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.877
Not if you mean it.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.950
Man, I love Fonny more than
I love anybody in this world.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.075
Makes me ashamed, man,
because he was a...

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.676
he was a real manly little boy
who wasn't scared of nothin'.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.471
Yeah, except, maybe his mama.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.189
And now he's in jail
and it ain't his fault,

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.511
and I don't know
how I'm gonna get him out.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.557
I'm sure one hell of a man.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.637
Well, he sure thinks you are.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.390
He loves you and respects you.

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.671
Let me tell you somethin' else.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.520
Your son is the father

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.557
of my daughter's child.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.030
Now, how you gonna sit here

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.032
and act like can't nothin' be done?

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.954
We got a baby
on the way here, man.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.396
You want me to beat
the shit out of you?

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:50.832
Now... I know some hustles,

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:52.912
and you know some hustles,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.313
and these are our children,
and we gotta set them free.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.280
So, let's drink on up, man,

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.795
and let's go on in.

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.679
We got a whole lot of shit
to deal with in a hurry.

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:27.035
TISH: <i>The date for Fonny's
trial keeps changing.</i>

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.790
<i>This fact, of course,
forces me to realize</i>

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.111
<i>that Hayward's concern is genuine.</i>

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.589
<i>I don't think that he very much cared
in the beginning.</i>

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.149
<i>He'd never taken a case
like Fonny's before,</i>

and back to do that, right?

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.919
Mm, she's been through enough,
more than enough.

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:28.594
Leave her alone.

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:32.160

for somethin' he didn't do.

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:34.630
Can we leave him alone?

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:41.037
Do you believe I love my daughter?

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.616
To be honest, lady,
it's hard to believe

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.597
that you have a daughter.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:51.199
Do you think I'd marry my child
to a rapist?

01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:52.760
You might not know.

01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:57.632
Why are you coming to me?

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:01.475
I'm not an American.

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.438
You-you-you, you,

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:06.513
you called them lawyers
up there, right?

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:11.197
I mean, look around. Shit.

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:14.717
I have my little thing here
and Victoria, she's-she's...

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.516
She's putting herself
back together.

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:25.197
And, lady, I don't need to put
her through anymore shit, okay?

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:28.273
No. No, no, no, no.
<i>Buena noche.</i>

01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.952
Look at 'em.

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:44.397
Do you think I came here
to make you suffer?

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.792
Look at me.

01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:55.200

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:01.272
No. No.

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:05.235

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:08.757
You take it to her
and you ask her, you show her.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:13.716
(sighs) I'm a woman...

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:16.797

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.032
I know she was raped.

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.234
But I also know...

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:29.109
I know Fonny did not rape her.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:47.119

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:29.712

Leave my children out of this.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.992
Why did you come back here?

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:50.712
If it happened to you...

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.712
what would you do?

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.559
Daughter, I was a woman

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.200
long before you was a woman,
remember that.

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:06.640
And I know...

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:09.797
I know you pay for the lies you tell.

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.198
You sent a man to jail,

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.034
one you ain't never even seen before.

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:20.079
Just 22 years old, young...

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.952
and he wants to marry my daughter.

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.680
I did see him.

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:29.594
You saw him in the police line-up.

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.997
That was the only time
you saw him.

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:35.430
What makes you so sure?

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.352
(sighs)

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.591
I've known him all his life.

01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:59.872
One thing I can tell, lady...

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:03.637
you ain't never been raped.

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:09.513
They took me down there...

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:12.354
and they told me to pick him out.

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.717
So that's what I did.
I picked him out.

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:17.439
But it was...

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:20.433
It happened in the dark.

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.638
- You saw Alonzo in the light.
- I saw enough.

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:31.190
Daughter,

- Daughter, please...
- Get off of me.

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:37.016
- Please listen...
- Get off of me.

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:38.110

Mama came home from Puerto Rico.
