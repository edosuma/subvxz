00:00.007 --> 00:01.090
The Espheni power core,

00:01.114 --> 00:03.093
was never on Earth
in the first place.

00:03.117 --> 00:05.082
Previously on
<i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:05.194 --> 00:06.767
We're gonna have to figure out
a way to get up there,

00:07.006 --> 00:08.273
blow that
son of a bitch up.

00:08.297 --> 00:10.440
The Beamer will lock onto
the Espheni homing beacon

00:10.464 --> 00:12.091
and fly to the Moon base.

00:12.115 --> 00:13.435
That Beamer's
on a one-way ticket.

00:13.441 --> 00:14.414
I should've known...

00:14.438 --> 00:16.700
When they announced the draw,
you'd find a way to go.

00:16.724 --> 00:18.011
We don't know
what we don't know.

00:18.035 --> 00:20.498
Maybe Lexi will come back.
Maybe she's not too far gone.

00:20.522 --> 00:22.675
<i>You won't be able</i>
<i>to control her for much longer.</i>

00:24.134 --> 00:24.920
Something's coming.

00:24.944 --> 00:25.954
Beamers!

00:28.661 --> 00:29.827
Hello, father.

00:32.362 --> 00:34.430
Lexi?

00:34.464 --> 00:35.745
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:35.769 --> 00:36.895
I came back to talk to you.

00:36.963 --> 00:38.897
There is so much
I need to explain.

00:40.633 --> 00:42.500
Everybody, get back to cover!
Dad.

00:42.535 --> 00:44.695
For all we know, the Espheni
could be right behind her.

00:44.719 --> 00:46.571
Roger that.
Positions, everybody!

00:46.606 --> 00:48.006
What the hell you doing,
Mason?

00:48.040 --> 00:49.880
Take it easy, Pope.
I'll handle this situation.

00:49.904 --> 00:51.076
Y-you'll handle it?

00:51.110 --> 00:52.611
Two weeks ago,
we were 200 strong.

00:52.678 --> 00:53.845
We're now down
to about 20.

00:53.879 --> 00:56.615
And she's
the one responsible.

00:56.649 --> 00:58.416
We back off...

00:58.451 --> 01:01.486
Until he's had a chance
to gauge if she's a threat.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.955
If?!

01:04.022 --> 01:05.489
You gonna talk to her?

01:05.524 --> 01:07.058
How about put
her down...

01:07.126 --> 01:09.794
Before she takes us
all out?

01:13.432 --> 01:15.192
Make sure that he doesn't do
anything stupid.

01:15.226 --> 01:17.107
Mission impossible.
Be careful, the both of you.

01:17.130 --> 01:17.919
Yeah, yeah.

01:17.921 --> 01:19.771
It's so good
to see you both. I...

01:19.805 --> 01:23.642
I came to apologize,
to tell you you were right.

01:23.676 --> 01:26.678
Trusting the Espheni
was a terrible mistake.

01:26.712 --> 01:27.912
That's quite
an understatement.

01:27.936 --> 01:31.383
Your eyes --
they're different.

01:31.450 --> 01:33.585
They're the way they were
before the cocoon.

01:33.653 --> 01:35.654
And I can see clearly now.

01:35.688 --> 01:38.089
For the first time, I know
what I need to do.

01:38.124 --> 01:41.559
The Espheni are monsters.

01:41.594 --> 01:43.361
I want to help you
destroy them.

01:43.396 --> 01:44.696
Yeah, well, it's not
that simple.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.331
You left us to join them,

01:46.365 --> 01:48.466
you said they were your family,
you killed Lourdes --

01:48.501 --> 01:50.902
And there isn't a moment that
I'm not sick over what I did.

01:50.936 --> 01:53.805
Look, when I first came out of
the cocoon, I was so confused.

01:53.839 --> 01:56.107
I thought
I was helping Lourdes,

01:56.142 --> 01:58.502
freeing her from the pain she'd
suffer when the attack came.

01:58.537 --> 02:00.217
This isn't just about her.
Look around you.

02:00.241 --> 02:01.880
We were devastated
by that attack!

02:01.914 --> 02:04.049
Those of us who survived
hold you responsible.

02:04.083 --> 02:08.186
I am, so, please, please,
let me make it up to you.

02:10.656 --> 02:12.457
What do you think
you're doing?

02:12.491 --> 02:14.659
What Mason doesn't have
the guts to do himself.

02:14.694 --> 02:16.661
You're gonna put that rifle down,
or I'm gonna take it from you.

02:16.696 --> 02:17.976
Look, in case
you hadn't noticed,

02:18.000 --> 02:19.164
that is the enemy
over there.

02:19.198 --> 02:22.100
The Espheni plan to use me
as their weapon.

02:22.134 --> 02:26.004
Let me be <i>your</i> weapon
and end this war.

02:26.038 --> 02:28.673
How, Lexi?

02:28.708 --> 02:30.742
How can we let you back
into our lives?

02:30.776 --> 02:31.776
We can't.

02:33.813 --> 02:35.313
We can't.

02:35.347 --> 02:37.482
Damn it, Colonel, those soldiers
in the 2nd Mass --

02:37.516 --> 02:39.516
we may not have started out
as the best of friends,

02:39.540 --> 02:41.653
but I fought alongside
those people.

02:41.687 --> 02:44.322
I suffered with them in
that godforsaken ghetto, and for what?

02:44.390 --> 02:47.559
So that crazy, psycho alien bitch
could wipe them out? Unh-unh.

02:47.593 --> 02:48.960
When you came out
of that thing, I made a promise

02:48.994 --> 02:50.994
that I would stop you
if you tried to hurt anybody,

02:51.018 --> 02:52.464
and I didn't do it.

02:52.498 --> 02:55.033
I'm not making
that mistake again.

02:56.267 --> 02:59.269
You're not thinking clearly.
This is complicated.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.410
What's complicated about
the graves I dug, Colonel --

03:02.411 --> 03:04.378
the women and children
I put in the ground?

03:04.413 --> 03:05.713
I understand that.

03:05.747 --> 03:09.116

she wasn't being

destroy the Beamers?

her from a painful death.

09:50.618 --> 09:52.752
Now I understand how twisted
that logic was,

09:52.820 --> 09:53.987
but in that moment, I...

09:54.021 --> 09:57.857
[ Sighs ]
I'm sorry.

09:57.892 --> 10:00.894
No, I wasn't
under their control.

10:01.212 --> 10:02.879
It was my own decision.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.754
[ Sighs ]
Lexi.

10:10.788 --> 10:12.422
I made a choice

10:12.490 --> 10:14.424
between my human family
and my Espheni family.

10:14.492 --> 10:17.127
Don't call those monsters
family.

10:17.161 --> 10:19.529
I wanted peace so badly
that I believed their lies.

10:19.597 --> 10:22.299
And I believed yours!

10:22.367 --> 10:23.500
I searched for you, Lexi.

10:23.534 --> 10:25.302
When I lost you,

10:25.336 --> 10:27.416
I would've gone to the ends
of the earth to find you,

10:27.440 --> 10:31.174
to find a way for us
to be together -- a family.

10:31.209 --> 10:33.510
But you --
you betrayed all of that!

10:33.544 --> 10:38.148
Now I know
that's never gonna happen --

10:38.182 --> 10:40.450
not now,
not after what you did.

10:40.485 --> 10:45.255
I know how badly
I violated your trust.

10:45.289 --> 10:50.060
So please, please,
let me make it up to you.

10:50.128 --> 10:51.995
I'm your best chance

10:52.030 --> 10:54.230
if you want to make it to
the power core and destroy it.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.100
How do you know
about that?

10:57.135 --> 10:59.503
When I was
with the Espheni,

10:59.537 --> 11:01.838
I-I learned how to control
my abilities.

11:01.873 --> 11:05.409
I -- I --
it's hard to explain.

11:05.443 --> 11:07.044
You better try.

11:07.078 --> 11:11.381
It's like I can see energy,

11:11.416 --> 11:13.216
manipulate it, all of it --

11:13.251 --> 11:17.954
gravity, radio waves,
electrical charges.

11:17.989 --> 11:20.857
And if I'm close enough, I can
access the Beamer systems.

11:20.892 --> 11:22.325
I can control them.

11:26.431 --> 11:28.398
Tom: <i>No, we can't afford</i>
<i>to hold the launch.</i>

11:28.433 --> 11:30.400
Cochise: <i>We have</i>
<i>no way of knowing</i>

11:30.435 --> 11:32.069
<i>if the power core</i>
<i>is guarded or not.</i>

11:32.103 --> 11:34.463
I can hear the conversation
on the ship -- the Volm and dad.

11:34.487 --> 11:36.373
They're preparing a bomb
you've built.

11:36.407 --> 11:39.509
Stop that! Don't do that!

11:39.544 --> 11:42.145
Is that why you're here?
No.

11:42.180 --> 11:43.980
Did the Espheni send you
to spy on us?

11:44.048 --> 11:45.382
No. No, no! I promise.

11:45.416 --> 11:47.884
Please.
I'm telling the truth.

11:47.919 --> 11:50.220
I rejected my Espheni father.
I want to help.

11:50.288 --> 11:52.556
The bomb you built
may be powerful enough

11:52.590 --> 11:55.225
to make it to the power core
and destroy it,

11:55.259 --> 11:57.094
but you'd have
to get it there first.

11:57.128 --> 11:59.863
You may have managed to get
that Beamer airborne,

11:59.897 --> 12:01.898
but to fly it
to the moon and back?

12:01.966 --> 12:05.869
If you attempt this without
my help, you'll die trying.

12:05.903 --> 12:07.984
Anne, if she knows about
the Beamer, then we don't --

12:08.008 --> 12:09.272
Dan, please! Please.

12:09.273 --> 12:12.275
I knew I had to come back.
This is the reason.

12:12.310 --> 12:14.845
I can fly the Beamer,
defend it if it's attacked.

12:14.879 --> 12:16.980
I should be the one
going on this mission.

12:17.014 --> 12:18.515

making a huge mistake.

About your daughter.

Tom.

13:29.073 --> 13:31.007
Where's Lexi?

13:31.041 --> 13:33.170
Anthony's keeping an eye on her
so she can stay alive

13:33.171 --> 13:35.011
long enough for us to talk
about the situation.

13:35.035 --> 13:36.934
What's the situation?
Just hear him out.

13:36.935 --> 13:38.601
Lexi has made an offer

13:38.669 --> 13:40.629
that I think it'd be
shortsighted not to consider.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.872
What's the offer?

13:42.906 --> 13:44.440
To go on the mission
with you

13:44.508 --> 13:46.576
instead of Ben.
Huh.

13:46.610 --> 13:47.492
You're on board with that?

13:47.516 --> 13:49.396
I think it's something
we should consider, yeah.

13:49.420 --> 13:51.681
She just took down
those Beamers, Tom.

13:51.715 --> 13:56.386
She just heard you and Cochise
talking inside of ours.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.821
She's not Jeanne, okay?

13:58.856 --> 14:01.891
Your daughter held on to her
humanity with every fiber. Ours didn't.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.794
Okay, you're right. She was
a willing participant. She admitted it.

14:04.828 --> 14:07.964
But does that change the fact
that she is our best chance --

14:07.998 --> 14:10.033
maybe our only chance?

14:10.100 --> 14:12.302
I understand
that emotions are raw.

14:12.336 --> 14:14.971
I understand that.
But this is war.

14:15.039 --> 14:16.572
We can't think
with our hearts.

14:16.607 --> 14:18.641
We got to think
with our heads.

14:18.709 --> 14:21.544
Remember when the allies had to team up
with Stalin in order to defeat Hitler?

14:21.612 --> 14:23.012
They knew that joining forces,

14:23.080 --> 14:25.348
even with you joining forces
with a monster, would be --

14:25.382 --> 14:27.102
Yeah, to win the war,
but we don't need her.

14:27.126 --> 14:28.484
We've already done
our homework.

14:28.552 --> 14:29.919
Unless the power core
is heavily guarded

14:29.953 --> 14:31.688
or we encounter
something else unexpected.

14:31.722 --> 14:32.889
I mean, having someone
that can operate the machinery

14:32.956 --> 14:34.586
just might make
the difference.

14:34.587 --> 14:35.137
Yes.

14:35.161 --> 14:37.241
I mean, we can't argue
the fact that Lexi's abilities

14:37.795 --> 14:39.896
give her an edge
that none of us have.

14:39.930 --> 14:42.832
Are you not even willing
to entertain that idea?

every step of this mission.

of her?

around her.

make the right call.

cloud my judgment.

than choice.

past luck, but thank you.

second-period American history right now.

it has to be.

down a Volm before it can regenerate,

might be able to kill
