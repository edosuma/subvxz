WEBVTT

00:04.327 --> 00:07.364
Captain's Starlog, September 18, 2152.

00:08.167 --> 00:10.681
We've entered orbit
of an uninhabited planet.

00:11.207 --> 00:14.836
Our scans show it's teeming with
all sorts of plant and animal life.

00:15.287 --> 00:17.642
I'll be leading a survey team
to the surface.

00:17.767 --> 00:21.601
A gorge on the south continent is five
times deeper than the Grand Canyon.

00:21.727 --> 00:22.842
What have you got in mind?

00:22.967 --> 00:25.083
How about a little river rafting?

00:25.207 --> 00:28.722
T'Pol says it only gets dark four days
a month, because of the binary suns.

00:28.847 --> 00:31.486
We'll have plenty of daylight left
after work every night.

00:31.607 --> 00:33.757
It'll take at least a week
to complete the survey.

00:33.887 --> 00:35.878
Should be enough time to sneak in
some R and R.

00:36.007 --> 00:38.316
- Bridge to Captain Archer.
- Go ahead.

00:38.447 --> 00:41.598
We've got an alien vessel approaching.
They're hailing us.

00:41.767 --> 00:44.235
- Put them through to Shuttlepod One.
- Yes, sir.

00:44.367 --> 00:46.085
New planet, new aliens.

00:46.207 --> 00:47.606
Banner day.

00:48.527 --> 00:50.165
We're very relieved to see you.

00:50.287 --> 00:52.278
I'm Rellus Tagrim. This is my crew.

00:52.407 --> 00:54.841
Captain Archer of the
Starship Enterprise.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.320
Something we can do for you?

00:56.447 --> 00:59.678
Considering the circumstances,
we'd like permission to come aboard...

00:59.807 --> 01:01.286
as soon as possible.

01:01.847 --> 01:03.724
What circumstances?

01:03.847 --> 01:06.645
The neutronic wavefront.
It's almost here.

01:09.367 --> 01:10.595
Nothing on sensors.

01:10.727 --> 01:14.083
You'll detect the storm in a few
minutes. It's travelling at high warp.

01:14.207 --> 01:17.802
Once we're aboard, I suggest
that you go to warp 7, immediately.

01:20.687 --> 01:22.564
Our top speed is warp 5.

01:26.407 --> 01:28.967
It's been a long road

01:31.687 --> 01:33.723
Gettin' from there to here

01:33.847 --> 01:36.645
It's been a long time

01:37.487 --> 01:40.957
But my time is finally near

01:41.447 --> 01:44.837
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:45.607 --> 01:48.440
I will touch the sky

01:48.847 --> 01:52.476
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:52.607 --> 01:55.599
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:55.727 --> 01:59.959
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:00.127 --> 02:03.164
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:03.287 --> 02:07.439
I've got faith to believe

02:07.567 --> 02:10.525
I can do anything

02:10.727 --> 02:14.436
I've got strength of the soul

02:15.047 --> 02:18.039
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:18.167 --> 02:22.365
I can reach any star

02:23.527 --> 02:25.518
I've got faith

02:27.367 --> 02:30.484
I've got faith

02:31.047 --> 02:34.323
Faith of the heart

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074

02:47.647 --> 02:50.445
The wavefront spans
more than half a dozen light-years.

02:50.567 --> 02:54.037
A Vulcan starship encountered
a class 5 over a century ago.

02:54.167 --> 02:57.716
The vessel was nearly destroyed.

02:58.967 --> 03:02.755
- How long until it hits?
- Approximately four hours.

03:03.687 --> 03:05.518
If we reinforce structural integrity...

03:05.647 --> 03:08.081
we should weather it
without too much trouble.

03:08.207 --> 03:09.925
Enterprise may survive.

03:10.047 --> 03:11.765
The crew is another matter.

03:12.007 --> 03:15.204
The storm is saturated
with radiolytic isotopes.

03:15.687 --> 03:18.997
If the crew's exposed,
they'll be dead within three minutes.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.318
Sickbay is the most heavily
shielded section.

03:21.447 --> 03:23.563
It's possible that some crew
could survive there.

03:23.687 --> 03:25.723
We can't fit 83 people into Sickbay.

03:25.847 --> 03:28.042
And I'm not about to draw lots.

03:29.127 --> 03:30.719
What about the Catwalk?

03:31.247 --> 03:34.842
You know, the maintenance shaft
running the length of each nacelle.

03:36.327 --> 03:38.795
They are heavily shielded...

03:38.927 --> 03:42.636
some kind of osmium alloy,
if I remember.

03:43.247 --> 03:46.159
You're proposing we take refuge
in a crawlspace?

03:46.287 --> 03:50.599
Lt'll be a tight squeeze, but there's no
reason we can't fit 83 people in there...

03:50.727 --> 03:52.558
and whatever supplies we need.

03:52.687 --> 03:53.881
Doctor?

03:54.007 --> 03:55.998
Do you know the absorption depth
of this alloy?

03:56.127 --> 03:58.357
At least 20,000 particles per micron.

03:59.047 --> 04:00.400
It should be adequate.

04:00.527 --> 04:02.119
There's just one other problem.

04:02.247 --> 04:05.284
It gets kind of toasty in there
when the warp coils are on line...

04:05.407 --> 04:07.398
about 300 degrees.

04:07.527 --> 04:10.087
We have to shut down the main reactor.

04:12.967 --> 04:15.322
I don't see that we have any choice.

04:16.447 --> 04:18.119
We'll use the Catwalk...

04:18.247 --> 04:21.125
and set up a command station
in one of the compartments.

04:21.247 --> 04:22.441
Aye, Captain.

04:23.367 --> 04:26.359
You'll be in charge of the evacuation.

04:26.487 --> 04:28.682
Take us out of orbit, Travis.

04:47.807 --> 04:49.525
Maybe we should open a window.

04:49.647 --> 04:53.003
You think it's stuffy now,
wait till we get 83 people in here.

04:53.127 --> 04:55.960
Don't forget Porthos,
and all the Doctor's animals.

04:57.327 --> 04:59.443
You ever been through a storm
as bad as this?

04:59.567 --> 05:03.162
Ran into a class 3 once.
Had to take shelter in the ship's core.

05:03.287 --> 05:04.879
We were down there for six weeks.

05:05.007 --> 05:06.235
Six weeks?

05:08.007 --> 05:09.963
Any idea about a latrine?

05:10.087 --> 05:11.998
Oh, I never thought about that.

05:12.447 --> 05:14.802
There're some storage lockers
in the aft compartment.

05:14.927 --> 05:17.760
We ought to be able to convert
a couple of them.

05:32.647 --> 05:34.763
This will be our bridge.

05:38.047 --> 05:40.322
We're going to have to jury-rig
these panels.

05:40.447 --> 05:42.358
Tap them into command functions.

05:42.487 --> 05:44.762
Not much room for a captain's chair.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.722
That storm must have been pretty scary.

05:49.847 --> 05:52.566
We only got worried
when the generators went down.

05:52.687 --> 05:55.326
We lost the grav-plating, life support.

05:56.407 --> 05:59.399
I'll never forget that look
in my father's eyes.

06:00.487 --> 06:02.523
He knew we were in trouble.

06:14.807 --> 06:17.196
Sorry to keep you in there so long.

06:17.327 --> 06:18.316
Please.

06:19.847 --> 06:20.996
We understand.

06:21.127 --> 06:24.278
My science officer tells me
you're from the Takret system.

06:24.407 --> 06:26.238
That's a long way from here.

06:26.367 --> 06:28.927
Our work often takes us far from home.

06:29.047 --> 06:31.356
- We're stellar cartographers.
- Really?

06:32.447 --> 06:36.406
Once we get out of the storm, maybe
you could help update our starcharts.

06:38.127 --> 06:40.322
- We'd be pleased.
- This way.

07:21.487 --> 07:24.047
You're behind schedule.
Do you need help?

07:24.287 --> 07:27.836
I understand you've allotted
15 cubic metres for medical supplies.

07:29.087 --> 07:30.236
That's correct.

07:30.367 --> 07:34.406
That means there's only enough room
for two-thirds of these cages.

07:37.487 --> 07:39.717
Perhaps some of your creatures
could share.

07:39.847 --> 07:41.439
They'll eat each other.

07:42.367 --> 07:45.882
They're vital to my work,
and to the health of this crew.

07:48.207 --> 07:51.005
I'm not accustomed to making
emotional appeals.

07:51.887 --> 07:55.482
Please, don't ask me
to choose between them.

07:57.767 --> 08:01.476
All right, 20 cubic metres.

08:03.007 --> 08:05.396
My Edosian slugs thank you.

08:09.967 --> 08:13.562
I'm afraid these aren't
first-class accommodations.

08:13.687 --> 08:15.678
They'll be fine, Commander.

08:16.487 --> 08:19.285
We're grateful for your hospitality.

08:19.407 --> 08:22.479
We're going to have a lot of time
to get to know each other.

08:22.607 --> 08:25.519
If you need anything,
I'll be right over here.

08:29.407 --> 08:31.841
I don't know the first thing
about stellar cartography.

08:31.967 --> 08:33.719
What if they begin to ask questions?

08:53.407 --> 08:54.681
Come in.

08:59.407 --> 09:01.841
I didn't expect it to be beautiful.

09:05.367 --> 09:08.279
Too bad we don't have time
to run some scans.

09:09.007 --> 09:12.124
We'll be inside the phenomenon
for nearly eight days.

09:12.407 --> 09:14.602
We can run all the scans we want.

09:14.807 --> 09:18.197
Lieutenant Reed has completed
his modifications.

09:21.887 --> 09:24.606
I'm a little nervous
about shutting down the power grid.

09:24.727 --> 09:27.082
A single neutronic surge
could overload the grid...

09:27.207 --> 09:29.846
and damage critical systems.

09:35.007 --> 09:38.124
I did a little research
in the Vulcan database.

09:38.247 --> 09:40.886
That class 5 storm a century ago...

09:41.687 --> 09:43.962
involved the Starship T'Plana.

09:44.807 --> 09:47.321
Apparently, they couldn't outrun
the wavefront.

09:47.447 --> 09:49.438
It was lost with all hands.

09:54.687 --> 09:57.599
I thought you said
it was nearly destroyed.

10:01.727 --> 10:04.161
I must have remembered incorrectly.

10:15.087 --> 10:17.476
- Bridge to Commander Tucker.
- Go ahead.

10:17.607 --> 10:20.519
- Ready for the handoff?
- Give me a second.

10:34.007 --> 10:35.759
Standing by, Captain.

10:47.727 --> 10:49.126
We're in the driver's seat.

10:49.247 --> 10:51.442
See you in a few minutes. Archer out.

10:54.127 --> 10:55.606
Let's close up shop.

11:27.527 --> 11:28.676
You've done a head count?

11:28.807 --> 11:31.799
Entire crew's accounted for,
including one quadruped.

11:32.727 --> 11:35.116
Would you like to try out
the Captain's chair?

11:35.447 --> 11:36.926
Maybe later.

11:43.727 --> 11:45.319
Where's the comm?

11:48.647 --> 11:50.558
All hands, this is the Captain.

11:50.887 --> 11:53.560
This catwalk is going to be our home
for a while.

11:53.687 --> 11:55.484
A week, maybe more.

11:55.607 --> 11:58.724
You may not be comfortable,
but you'll be alive.

11:59.487 --> 12:01.159
We have the best crew in the fleet...

12:01.287 --> 12:03.039
and the sturdiest ship.

12:03.167 --> 12:06.125
I promise you, we'll get through this.

12:13.487 --> 12:17.321
- Time?
- One minute, five seconds.

12:17.527 --> 12:19.597
Polarise the hull plating.

12:28.007 --> 12:29.406
Thirty seconds.

12:33.567 --> 12:36.764
- Travis?
- Spatial turbulence.

12:39.527 --> 12:41.040
Twenty seconds.

12:45.007 --> 12:46.725
Fifteen.

12:48.607 --> 12:49.596
Ten.

12:52.167 --> 12:53.156
All hands...

12:53.287 --> 12:54.879
brace for impact.

13:04.847 --> 13:08.157
- Aft stabilisers aren't engaging.
- Try them again.

13:20.807 --> 13:22.638
Grav-shear's dropping.

13:28.127 --> 13:31.244
That should be the worst of it, sir,
at least for now.

13:54.607 --> 13:55.596
Yours?

13:58.607 --> 14:00.802
Looks like you're almost finished.

14:04.447 --> 14:07.837
You wouldn't know who was the first
Vulcan ambassador to Earth?

14:08.087 --> 14:10.123
Six letters, ends with an "R"?

14:10.247 --> 14:12.283
Solkar, I think.

14:13.007 --> 14:16.158
- Thanks, Captain.
- Don't mention it.

14:26.047 --> 14:28.641
- How are you holding up?
- Pretty well, sir.

14:28.767 --> 14:32.362
A few days in this place should cure
anyone of claustrophobia.

14:32.487 --> 14:35.843
Your quarters will probably feel
like a ballroom after this.

14:40.607 --> 14:44.520
You're the captain. Can't you order
the storm to calm down a little?

14:44.647 --> 14:46.319
I'll see what I can do.

14:59.167 --> 15:03.126
Someone else has already asked for it,
so why isn't he doing anything about it?

15:03.247 --> 15:04.396
How should I know?

15:04.527 --> 15:06.358
...another day in this place.

15:09.287 --> 15:11.596
We're running out of food.

15:14.167 --> 15:17.796
- How are they doing?
- Well, your guess is as good as mine.

15:18.567 --> 15:22.327
One of them came out a few hours ago.
Said we were making too much noise.

15:22.327 --> 15:22.804
One of them came out a few hours ago.
Said we were making too much noise.

15:23.567 --> 15:27.003
Now, I've been real friendly.
Even asked them to join the game.

15:27.647 --> 15:30.844
Doesn't seem like they want to have
anything to do with us.

15:32.367 --> 15:34.835
Let's give them a little time to adjust.

15:35.807 --> 15:39.038
I bet by now we'd have set up camp
on the rim of that canyon...

15:39.167 --> 15:40.759
had a fire going.

15:41.167 --> 15:42.839
There'll be other canyons.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.157
Lieutenant, are you passing through...

15:56.287 --> 15:58.403
or is there something
I can help you with?

15:58.527 --> 16:00.643
Actually, there is something.

16:01.487 --> 16:02.681
Yes?

16:06.407 --> 16:10.480
I assume I can depend
on doctor-patient confidentiality?

16:10.607 --> 16:14.202
This wouldn't have anything to do
with gastrointestinal distress?

16:14.487 --> 16:16.682
- Is it that obvious?
- Not at all.

16:16.807 --> 16:18.604
There's a notation in your medical file.

16:18.727 --> 16:22.606
Something about an unfortunate
incident during zero-g training.

16:22.727 --> 16:26.845
The EV simulator at Lunaport.
Or as Starfleet trainees call it:

16:26.967 --> 16:28.286
The vomitorium.

16:28.407 --> 16:30.125
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

16:30.247 --> 16:34.877
I've treated a number of crewmen
this afternoon for motion sickness.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.243
That should last about 12 hours.

16:39.007 --> 16:39.996
Thank you, Doctor.

16:40.127 --> 16:42.197
Feeling all right, Malcolm?

16:43.047 --> 16:44.446
Never better.

16:50.727 --> 16:52.001
Any problems with the crew?

16:52.127 --> 16:54.243
Oh, a few bumps and bruises
from the turbulence.

16:54.367 --> 16:55.846
Nothing too serious.

16:57.047 --> 17:00.801
I could see about moving some of this
to the aft section.

17:00.927 --> 17:03.521
Nonsense. I have plenty of room.

17:03.767 --> 17:07.042
I find the close quarters rather
comforting. Reminds me of home.

17:07.166 --> 17:10.079
I didn't realise space
was at a premium on Denobula.

17:10.406 --> 17:13.160
Twelve billion people
sharing one continent.

17:14.247 --> 17:16.363
Let me know if you change your mind.

17:21.047 --> 17:22.082
Travis?

17:22.207 --> 17:25.597
We've got a cluster of plasma eddies
about 80,000 kilometres ahead.

17:25.727 --> 17:27.479
I should be able to steer clear of them.

17:27.607 --> 17:28.881
Wake me if there's a problem.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.326
Aye, Captain.

17:30.447 --> 17:33.200
When we're past those eddies,
try and get some rest yourself.

17:33.327 --> 17:34.840
Ensign Tanner can relieve you.

17:34.967 --> 17:37.640
- Thank you, sir. Good night.
- Good night.

17:51.927 --> 17:53.838
Go on, go to sleep.

18:16.167 --> 18:19.523
- Does this bother you?
- Only slightly.

18:40.287 --> 18:43.324
- Am I disturbing you?
- Only slightly.

18:55.447 --> 18:59.076
- There's a bright side to all of this.
- Really?

19:00.327 --> 19:02.887
It's bringing the crew closer together.

19:03.367 --> 19:07.963
If you forget about the storm outside,
this is like going on a camping trip.

19:08.367 --> 19:10.835
Perhaps we can sing a few songs later.

19:13.247 --> 19:15.317
Haven't you ever gone camping?

19:19.767 --> 19:21.485
In a manner of speaking.

19:22.607 --> 19:25.440
I once participated in
the kahs-wan ritual.

19:26.127 --> 19:29.324
I was taken to the desert
and left to survive for 10 days.

19:29.647 --> 19:31.126
Sounds fun.

19:34.727 --> 19:38.766
You haven't left the command area
much today.

19:39.487 --> 19:42.399
You might want to wander around,
get to know the crew.

19:42.527 --> 19:44.597
I'm familiar with every one of them.

19:44.727 --> 19:48.242
There's a lot more to these people
than just their names.

19:48.527 --> 19:51.439
It'd be good for you to fraternise a little.

19:52.847 --> 19:55.566
- Is that an order?
- Does it have to be?

20:02.447 --> 20:05.041
I'm not skilled at fraternising.

20:10.447 --> 20:12.438
Here's a chance to learn.

20:21.727 --> 20:26.562
I'll see your strawberry shortcake,
and I'll raise you...

20:27.767 --> 20:29.917
one pineapple cobbler.

20:36.487 --> 20:38.842
- Broccoli?
- I'm out of desserts.

20:38.967 --> 20:40.161
Call.

20:40.767 --> 20:43.486
What I wouldn't give for a shower
right about now.

20:43.607 --> 20:46.963
When this hand's over,
maybe you could look into building one.

20:48.007 --> 20:50.282
Would you like a sauna while I'm at it?

20:51.007 --> 20:53.282
You knew we'd be stuck in here
for over a week.

20:53.407 --> 20:56.365
You might have given a little thought
to making it tolerable.

20:56.487 --> 20:58.523
I only had four hours, Malcolm.

20:58.647 --> 21:00.205
You're lucky we've got a toilet.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.795
I obviously overestimated
your people's abilities...

21:02.927 --> 21:05.157
when it comes to indoor plumbing.

21:05.287 --> 21:08.563
You want to take a shower?
Build one yourself.

21:11.167 --> 21:12.964
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thanks, Chef.

21:13.767 --> 21:15.246
Pot roast!

21:16.447 --> 21:19.598
That's the third time in three days.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.278
Anyone know
what they're showing tonight?

21:23.407 --> 21:25.159
The Day the Earth Stood Still.

21:25.287 --> 21:27.596
We're having movie night in here?

21:27.727 --> 21:28.842
Captain's orders.

21:28.967 --> 21:32.323
I set up a monitor in compartment five.
The screen's a little small...

21:32.447 --> 21:35.484
Who's picking these movies?
Shouldn't we all get a vote?

21:36.927 --> 21:38.679
I think something's burning.

21:42.847 --> 21:45.407
Are you aware you're sitting
on top of a plasma manifold?

21:45.527 --> 21:47.438
You got to turn that thing off!

21:49.647 --> 21:52.957
I apologise, Commander.
We should have spoken with you first.

21:53.247 --> 21:54.680
That might have been a good idea.

21:54.807 --> 21:57.037
We've had trouble digesting your food.

21:57.727 --> 21:59.080
Archer to Tucker.

22:01.967 --> 22:03.036
Go ahead.

22:03.167 --> 22:06.318
- I need you in the command area now.
- I'll be right there.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.076
I'll talk to Chef.

22:09.207 --> 22:12.643
Maybe he can heat that up for you.

22:23.087 --> 22:25.237
We may have a problem in Engineering.

22:25.447 --> 22:27.517
The antimatter injectors
have come on-line.

22:27.647 --> 22:28.966
That can't be right.

22:29.087 --> 22:30.679
Probably just a glitch.

22:32.047 --> 22:34.959
Think you've got room
for one more sleeping bag in here?

22:35.087 --> 22:37.282
Not happy with your bunk mates?

22:37.807 --> 22:40.685
I caught them throwing a barbecue
next to a plasma manifold.

22:40.807 --> 22:43.765
I understand we're explorers.
We ought to keep an open mind...

22:43.887 --> 22:46.765
about different cultures.
But these guys are driving me crazy.

22:46.887 --> 22:50.482
They only need to sleep once a week,
so they've kept us up two nights...

22:50.607 --> 22:54.282
with their strange rituals.
Chanting, walking in circles.

22:54.927 --> 22:57.316
They've practically taken over
the compartment.

22:57.447 --> 23:01.076
Don't forget they warned us
about the storm. We owe them.

23:02.127 --> 23:05.597
- Be patient.
- I'm trying.

23:09.087 --> 23:12.523
Looks like the matter injectors
and the antimatter injectors are online.

23:12.647 --> 23:14.683
Two sensor glitches?

23:14.807 --> 23:17.446
A power surge
could have triggered both circuits.

23:17.567 --> 23:20.400
Do you have any idea
what the odds are of that happening?

23:20.527 --> 23:22.358
Can you shut them down?

23:23.527 --> 23:24.926
Not from here.

23:27.527 --> 23:30.678
Someone's going to have to go
to Engineering.

23:39.287 --> 23:42.757
Remember, the suit will protect you
for only 22 minutes.

23:46.487 --> 23:50.196
It'd be best not to take the scenic route.

27:06.887 --> 27:10.038
We've searched every deck.
There's no sign of the fugitives.

27:10.167 --> 27:14.126
- What about the crew?
- It appears they have deserted the ship.

27:14.247 --> 27:19.162
These humans, they've travelled over
100 light-years from their homeworld.

27:21.687 --> 27:25.566
Captain's Starlog, February 9, 2152.

27:26.127 --> 27:29.119
The Vulcans have allowed
the Mazarites to leave.

27:29.247 --> 27:30.839
Ambassador V'Lar says that...

27:30.967 --> 27:34.755
Archer and his crew must have
taken refuge in a nearby system.

27:35.767 --> 27:38.042
They may intend to return.

27:39.447 --> 27:42.041
What's the status of the warp engines?

27:42.647 --> 27:45.719
I'm having difficulty
with the dilithium matrix.

27:46.927 --> 27:48.645
Make it a priority.

27:56.447 --> 28:00.440
...2152. We've responded to a
distress call from a vessel in the...

28:01.007 --> 28:04.204
They're immune to radiolytic isotopes.

28:05.047 --> 28:06.958
The storm was never
any threat to them.

28:07.087 --> 28:09.555
Funny. You didn't mention that.

28:09.687 --> 28:12.201
We were in danger.
Our ship is less durable than yours.

28:12.327 --> 28:14.204
We would have been destroyed
by the storm!

28:14.327 --> 28:16.397
Who are they?
What are they doing here?

28:16.527 --> 28:18.677
Captain, I assure you,
we don't know these men.

28:18.807 --> 28:20.559
They just happened to find Enterprise...

28:20.687 --> 28:23.247
in the middle of a class 5
neutronic storm?

28:23.647 --> 28:25.444
Where three members
of their own species...

28:25.567 --> 28:27.478
just happened to be taking refuge?

28:27.607 --> 28:30.121
We're more than 20 light-years
from your homeworld.

28:30.247 --> 28:31.839
It's an unlikely coincidence.

28:31.967 --> 28:35.198
I get the feeling
they must be looking for you.

28:40.727 --> 28:42.080
Answer me!

28:42.207 --> 28:44.801
- I told you we shouldn't have come here.
- Guri.

28:45.247 --> 28:46.885
They're officers of the Takret Militia.

28:47.007 --> 28:50.158
They've been pursuing us for weeks.
We thought we'd evade them...

28:50.287 --> 28:51.561
by hiding aboard your ship.

28:51.687 --> 28:54.645
They must have detected our vessel
in your launch bay.

28:58.127 --> 28:59.242
What do they want with you?

28:59.367 --> 29:01.835
We used to be members of the militia
in the lower ranks.

29:01.967 --> 29:05.004
But after a year, we realised
the commanding officers were corrupt.

29:05.127 --> 29:07.277
They seize alien vessels
without provocation.

29:07.407 --> 29:09.523
They murder the crews,
take anything of value.

29:09.647 --> 29:11.126
They're little more than criminals.

29:11.247 --> 29:14.444
We tried to resign our commissions
but they wouldn't allow it.

29:19.367 --> 29:21.244
- You're deserters.
- We had no choice.

29:21.367 --> 29:25.485
We would have told you the truth, but
we weren't sure that you would help us.

29:25.847 --> 29:28.156
If they find us, we'll be executed.

29:28.287 --> 29:32.246
Captain, I apologise for the difficult
position that we've put you in.

29:32.487 --> 29:33.636
But I know these men.

29:33.767 --> 29:36.156
Even if they found us,
I doubt they'd simply leave.

29:36.287 --> 29:39.563
They've captured vessels
far less impressive than yours.

29:39.727 --> 29:42.241
They're trying
to re-initialise the warp reactor, sir.

29:42.367 --> 29:45.404
They've already decided
to help themselves to Enterprise.

29:45.527 --> 29:47.961
They obviously don't realise
we're in the Catwalk.

29:48.087 --> 29:51.477
If they learn we're here, it would
undoubtedly endanger the crew.

29:51.607 --> 29:54.724
What are you suggesting?
We just sit on our hands...

29:54.847 --> 29:56.644
until they fire up the engines?

29:56.767 --> 29:59.520
You're assuming these three
are telling the truth.

29:59.767 --> 30:02.327
- They've already lied to us.
- We're not lying.

30:02.447 --> 30:04.438
These men are dangerous.

30:13.167 --> 30:15.601
- Paltani to Captain.
- Yes?

30:15.727 --> 30:17.638
The dilithium matrix is active.

30:17.767 --> 30:20.042
We're ready to initialise
the warp reactor.

30:20.167 --> 30:21.156
Stand by.

30:21.287 --> 30:25.360
- Do we have helm control?
- Navigation relays aren't responding.

30:25.487 --> 30:27.239
I think they've been rerouted.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.801
- How much longer?
- I'm not certain.

30:30.967 --> 30:33.720
Bring the warp engines online
and report to the Bridge.

30:33.847 --> 30:35.439
Acknowledged.

30:36.767 --> 30:39.406
We may outnumber them,
but we only have three EV suits.

30:39.527 --> 30:41.677
I could take a security team
and bring back more.

30:41.807 --> 30:44.401
I doubt you'd get far.
The launch bay's crawling with them.

30:44.527 --> 30:47.325
Even with the suits, we only have
22 minutes in the radiation.

30:47.447 --> 30:50.200
Hard to believe we could retake
the ship in that amount...

30:56.967 --> 30:58.195
How long do we have?

30:58.327 --> 31:01.046
Lt'll take a while
for the warp coils to charge.

31:01.207 --> 31:04.199
- How long?
- Twenty minutes, tops.

31:11.287 --> 31:14.279
- Remember, junction 42-alpha.
- Understood.

31:14.407 --> 31:16.796
Third panel, starboard side.
And be careful.

31:16.927 --> 31:19.964
There's a lot of current
running through those circuits.

31:21.167 --> 31:23.078
I really ought to be doing this, Captain.

31:23.207 --> 31:25.482
The Doc said I was only out there
for 13 minutes.

31:25.607 --> 31:26.642
Forget it, Trip.

31:26.767 --> 31:29.964
- You've already been exposed.
- I've isolated your comm frequencies.

31:30.087 --> 31:31.839
They won't hear a thing.

31:32.567 --> 31:35.127
Tell Travis to wait for my signal.

31:37.687 --> 31:39.917
- Any progress?
- Not yet.

31:41.847 --> 31:45.237
We could lose our ship by staying.
We should take what we can and leave.

31:45.367 --> 31:48.040
Keep working. I want helm control.

31:51.447 --> 31:54.883
- See you at the Catwalk. Don't be late.
- Aye, Captain.

32:25.087 --> 32:26.202
T'Pol?

32:26.327 --> 32:28.204
- We're in position.
- All right.

32:28.327 --> 32:31.444
First you're going to have to disrupt
the antimatter stream.

32:31.567 --> 32:34.718
See the blue conduit
to the left of the power transfer module?

32:34.847 --> 32:36.166
Go ahead.

32:36.287 --> 32:38.960
Start by locking down
the flow regulators.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.645
Stand by.

32:53.647 --> 32:54.841
We're being hailed.

32:54.967 --> 32:58.039
- Another ship?
- No.

32:58.767 --> 33:01.235
It's coming from within this vessel.

33:01.967 --> 33:03.400
Answer it.

33:06.807 --> 33:09.844
- You're in my chair.
- Captain Archer.

33:09.967 --> 33:14.165
I didn't realise you were still aboard.
Where's the rest of your crew?

33:15.767 --> 33:18.327
They're dead, killed by the storm.

33:18.447 --> 33:21.564
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks for your condolences.

33:22.447 --> 33:26.326
Now why don't you
get the hell off my ship?

33:26.487 --> 33:29.285
I'm afraid I can't do that.

33:29.607 --> 33:33.486
We detected a vessel in your launch
bay that belongs to three fugitives.

33:33.687 --> 33:35.598
I've been watching you.

33:39.567 --> 33:41.922
I know you're trying to take Enterprise.

33:43.327 --> 33:44.601
I'm not going to let you.

33:44.727 --> 33:47.878
You're in no position
to do anything about it.

33:48.007 --> 33:50.202
I'm in command of this bridge.

33:51.007 --> 33:54.886
Your vessel has been impounded
under the authority of the Takret Militia.

33:55.167 --> 33:58.204
When we return, you'll be charged
with criminal conspiracy.

33:58.327 --> 34:02.002
I don't recognise your authority.
I answer to Starfleet Command...

34:02.127 --> 34:05.278
and I'm under orders
to use any means necessary...

34:05.847 --> 34:07.883
to keep my ship from falling...

34:08.007 --> 34:09.485
into enemy hands.

34:09.607 --> 34:12.074
I have soldiers searching every deck.

34:12.567 --> 34:15.286
It's only a matter of time
before they find you.

34:15.407 --> 34:19.366
You're leaving me no choice.

34:20.847 --> 34:22.917
I'll destroy Enterprise.

34:23.447 --> 34:26.280
Earth's first warp 5 Starship?

34:27.047 --> 34:31.518
Your father's engine?
I've been reading about you, Captain.

34:31.647 --> 34:35.879
I doubt very much if you'll do anything
to damage this vessel.

34:36.847 --> 34:38.757
You'd be surprised.

34:40.087 --> 34:41.600
Can you trace his signal?

34:41.726 --> 34:45.639
- He's somewhere on the fifth deck.
- You have men there. Alert them.

34:46.487 --> 34:49.559
- Go ahead.
- It's time to change course, Travis.

34:49.687 --> 34:52.281
- Head for that plasma eddy.
- It'll take a minute, sir.

34:52.407 --> 34:54.318
Try to keep us in one piece.

34:54.447 --> 34:56.641
I'm on my way back. Archer out.

35:13.887 --> 35:16.401
- We've altered course!
- Where's he taking us?

35:17.447 --> 35:19.438
What's the problem
shutting down the reactor?

35:19.567 --> 35:22.035
We're having trouble
with the dilithium sequencers.

35:22.167 --> 35:25.125
- It's taking longer than expected.
- I don't mean to rush you...

35:25.247 --> 35:26.767
but it's getting pretty warm in here.

35:26.767 --> 35:27.643
But it's getting pretty warm in here.

35:47.007 --> 35:49.157
He's steering us toward a plasma eddy.

35:49.287 --> 35:52.484
- How long?
- Less than eight minutes.

35:55.167 --> 35:58.364
- Get me helm control!
- It'll take me much longer than that.

35:58.527 --> 36:00.040
- We should evacuate.
- No!

36:00.167 --> 36:01.395
You heard what he said.

36:01.527 --> 36:04.166
He's willing to destroy his own ship.

36:06.927 --> 36:09.361
The temperature just went up
another six degrees.

36:09.487 --> 36:10.966
Subcommander, how's it coming?

36:11.087 --> 36:13.442
We're disabling the final sequencer.

36:23.687 --> 36:25.598
The warp reactor has shut down.

36:27.487 --> 36:30.957
Spatial disturbance!
We're four minutes from the eddy.

36:53.047 --> 36:55.720
Unless you've found a way
to turn this ship around...

36:55.847 --> 36:58.998
I strongly suggest we abort the mission!

36:59.927 --> 37:01.599
Three minutes?

37:02.887 --> 37:06.482
Soldiers, report to the docking hatch,
immediately!

37:06.807 --> 37:09.765
I repeat: Report to the docking hatch!

37:21.007 --> 37:21.996
Report.

37:22.167 --> 37:24.397
We're too close to the eddy.
We've got to veer off.

37:24.527 --> 37:25.960
Maintain your course.

37:36.247 --> 37:38.124
Another one like that'll split us in two.

37:38.247 --> 37:40.477
They could still be on board.

37:40.607 --> 37:41.926
We've got no choice.

37:42.047 --> 37:44.481
Maintain your course. That's an order.

37:45.687 --> 37:47.120
Go ahead.

37:47.247 --> 37:50.478
Travis, hope you're not still heading
for that eddy.

37:50.607 --> 37:52.359
Our friends are gone.

37:52.487 --> 37:53.840
Ensign.

38:13.887 --> 38:16.037
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

38:16.287 --> 38:19.085
We seem to have passed through
the worst part of the storm.

38:19.207 --> 38:22.119
But it will still be a while
before we can leave the Catwalk.

38:22.247 --> 38:24.317
The crew's in relatively good spirits...

38:24.447 --> 38:28.122
considering they haven't had
a change of uniform in eight days.

38:33.447 --> 38:35.278
Did that guy shoot one of his own men?

38:35.407 --> 38:37.967
It's hard to tell them apart
in those ridiculous hats.

38:38.087 --> 38:41.921
The dead man was secretly working
for Sheriff Boggs.

38:43.487 --> 38:46.285
- How do you know that?
- Isn't it obvious?

38:49.167 --> 38:51.362
All hands, this is the Captain.

38:51.487 --> 38:54.320
Thanks to some fine piloting
by Travis Mayweather...

38:54.447 --> 38:57.803
we're going to be moving out of
the storm a little earlier than expected.

38:57.927 --> 39:00.487
We should be clear in a few minutes.

39:06.447 --> 39:08.358
Glad you could join us,
Subcommander.

39:08.487 --> 39:12.685
We have movie night every Tuesday,
if you're interested.

39:36.727 --> 39:39.446
I apologise for the trouble we've caused.

39:40.327 --> 39:43.239
- Where are you headed next?
- The Gyrannan System.

39:43.367 --> 39:46.757
- We should be safe there.
- Good luck.

39:58.847 --> 40:00.405
That's everyone.

40:01.305 --> 40:07.581
