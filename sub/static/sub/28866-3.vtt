01:04.200 --> 01:05.367
Adam.

01:12.133 --> 01:13.532
Adam.

01:13.534 --> 01:15.634
It's me.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.534
Adam.

01:50.300 --> 01:51.665
Adam?

01:51.667 --> 01:53.767
Stop playing.
It's not funny.

02:10.701 --> 02:13.699
Hello, emergency services.
Which service do you require?

02:13.701 --> 02:15.966
Police.
The police, yes.

02:15.968 --> 02:17.065
Hello?

02:17.067 --> 02:18.832
What's the address
of the emergency?

02:18.834 --> 02:21.265
A-A boat on the Thames
near Jessops Lane.

02:21.267 --> 02:22.465
It's called <i>Nieuwe Zorg.</i>

02:22.467 --> 02:24.031
What's the phone number
you're calling from?

02:24.033 --> 02:26.599
- I-I don't know.
- What's happened?

02:26.601 --> 02:28.601
He's dead! I don't know!
He's dead!

02:32.033 --> 02:35.499
Okay, just try and stay
as calm as you can for me.

02:35.501 --> 02:37.901
- What's your name?
- I-I can't.

03:06.567 --> 03:08.031
- Police!
- Police!

03:08.033 --> 03:09.100
Anyone here?!

03:11.701 --> 03:14.801
Control, this is 874
confirming a dead body.

03:22.834 --> 03:25.398
What have we got?

03:25.400 --> 03:27.265
White male, early 30s.

03:27.267 --> 03:29.699
Visible injury
to the back of the head.

03:29.701 --> 03:31.998
The woman who called
wouldn't leave her name.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.499
Can we go in yet?

03:33.501 --> 03:34.868
Yeah, just been given
the all clear.

03:47.601 --> 03:50.234
Been dead eight, nine hours max.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.599
Blow to the back of the head
with a blunt object.

03:54.601 --> 03:57.499
He's tucked up neatly.

03:57.501 --> 03:58.567
It's like...

03:59.834 --> 04:03.734
...he's been placed in the bed
with some care.

04:05.067 --> 04:06.667
Dent in the pillow.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.467
Suggests he had company.

04:12.734 --> 04:14.332
Lipstick mark.

04:14.334 --> 04:15.899
Fits with
the loving presentation.

04:23.601 --> 04:25.699
That phone made the 999 call.

04:25.701 --> 04:27.866
- I.D.?
- Adam and Sasha Garrick.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.732
He's a doctor
and she's a nurse

04:29.734 --> 04:31.834
at St. Martha's
University Hospital.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.365
How was your shift?

04:44.367 --> 04:46.801
Oh!

04:48.067 --> 04:50.298
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

04:50.300 --> 04:53.167
I-I just thought
you'd still be sleeping.

04:54.067 --> 04:55.632
No.

04:55.634 --> 04:57.701
Been up for ages.

05:06.701 --> 05:08.665
There's blood all the way
up the stairs.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.499
He's been moved from the kitchen
into the bed.

05:11.501 --> 05:13.031
Why, though?

05:13.033 --> 05:14.998
They weren't trying
to conceal him.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.701
Why risk even more
DNA contamination?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.699
Pestle's missing.

05:38.701 --> 05:39.966
Or is it mortar?

05:39.968 --> 05:41.899
Do you know, I can never
remember which one's which.

05:41.901 --> 05:44.031
It's weighty enough.

05:44.033 --> 05:45.632
Yeah.

05:45.634 --> 05:47.899
The hospital have confirmed
the victim's wife

05:47.901 --> 05:49.432
is working a night shift.

05:49.434 --> 05:52.300
Arrived at 7:00 p.m.

06:05.567 --> 06:07.000
Uh, Mrs. Garrick?

06:08.033 --> 06:10.932
I'm Detective Sergeant
Vivienne Cole, and this is...

06:10.934 --> 06:13.699
You're police officers, yeah.

06:13.701 --> 06:16.232
Is there somewhere we can talk?

06:16.234 --> 06:18.131
I'm a nurse.

06:18.133 --> 06:20.332
I know all about
delivering bad news.

06:20.334 --> 06:22.198
Is it my mum?

06:22.200 --> 06:24.532
I'm very sorry,
but your husband, Adam...

06:24.534 --> 06:26.298
Is all right?

06:26.300 --> 06:28.098
He's been in an accident
or something,

06:28.100 --> 06:30.667
but he's all right, isn't he?

06:32.601 --> 06:34.501
Adam's been killed.

06:38.100 --> 06:41.699
You're not in uniform.
What department are you from?

06:41.701 --> 06:44.699
We're a murder investigation
team, Mrs. Garrick.

06:44.701 --> 06:47.866
You're telling me
Adam's been murdered?

06:47.868 --> 06:51.532
Yeah.
He was found dead this morning.

06:51.534 --> 06:53.532
Where?

06:53.534 --> 06:55.601
On your houseboat.

07:12.667 --> 07:15.699
This is the anonymous 999 call.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.599
<i>Police.
The police, yes.</i>

07:17.601 --> 07:19.065
<i>Hello?</i>

07:19.067 --> 07:20.866
<i>What's the address
of the emergency?</i>

07:20.868 --> 07:23.065
<i>A-A boat on the Thames
near Jessops Lane.</i>

07:23.067 --> 07:24.465
<i>It's called</i> Nieuwe Zorg.

07:24.467 --> 07:26.265
<i>What's the phone number
you're calling from?</i>

07:26.267 --> 07:28.365
- <i>I-I don't know.</i>
- <i>What's happened?</i>

07:28.367 --> 07:29.866
<i>He's dead! I don't know!
He's dead!</i>

07:29.868 --> 07:32.866
<i>Okay, just try and stay
as calm as you can for me.</i>

07:32.868 --> 07:35.532
- <i>What's your name?</i>
- <i>I-I can't.</i>

07:37.601 --> 07:39.799
Goes without saying
we need to identify the caller

07:39.801 --> 07:40.934
as soon as possible.

07:43.734 --> 07:47.200
The victim received a call from
someone called Bob at 21:59.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.998
The 999 call was made
at 7:45 a.m.,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.232
so Bob may have been the last
person to have spoken to him.

07:55.234 --> 07:57.234
Let's find Bob, then.

08:05.701 --> 08:09.000
It was
his dad's funeral yesterday.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.632
He had a massive row
with his brother.

08:13.634 --> 08:15.398
Do you know
what they argued about?

08:15.400 --> 08:17.332
I don't know.

08:17.334 --> 08:19.367
They hadn't seen each other
for years.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.298
They're like chalk and cheese.

08:22.300 --> 08:25.565
Adam's probably the most driven
person that I've ever met,

08:25.567 --> 08:29.065
and Sammy's never held down
a job for more than a week.

08:29.067 --> 08:31.098
Do you have contact details
for him?

08:31.100 --> 08:32.265
No.

08:32.267 --> 08:33.932
Adam didn't get on with him.

08:33.933 --> 08:36.433
Anne will.
Adam's Mum.

08:37.967 --> 08:41.932
Okay, um, so they had a big row,
and then what?

08:41.933 --> 08:43.232
We left.

08:43.234 --> 08:45.701
- What time?
- 5:00ish.

08:46.834 --> 08:50.667
We had to get back anyway.
My... My shift started at 7:00.

08:52.434 --> 08:55.165
I didn't want to leave Adam
at home on his own,

08:55.167 --> 08:57.601
but he said he was fine.

08:58.801 --> 09:02.365
He'll have operations today.
They'll have to be canceled.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.932
He's just just been made
clinical lead.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.934
Someone will need to sort it.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.632
Have you been back
to the houseboat since?

09:12.634 --> 09:15.100
No.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.765
<i>Police.
The police, yes.</i>

09:22.767 --> 09:24.031
<i>Hello?</i>

09:24.033 --> 09:25.832
<i>What's the address
of the emergency?</i>

09:25.834 --> 09:28.365
<i>A-A boat on the Thames
near Jessops Lane.</i>

09:28.367 --> 09:29.765
<i>It's called</i> Nieuwe Zorg.

09:29.767 --> 09:31.365
<i>What's the phone number
you're calling from?</i>

09:31.367 --> 09:33.332
- <i>I-I don't know.</i>
- <i>What's happened?</i>

09:33.334 --> 09:34.866
<i>He's dead! I don't know!
He's dead!</i>

09:34.868 --> 09:37.832
<i>Okay, just try and stay
as calm as you can for me.</i>

09:37.834 --> 09:40.499
- <i>What's your name?</i>
- <i>I-I can't.</i>

09:43.234 --> 09:48.234
A woman made this call at 7:45
this morning from your boat.

09:49.234 --> 09:52.298
Do you know
who the caller is?

09:52.300 --> 09:54.398
Eleanor Kemp.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.732
And do you know of any reason
why she would be

09:56.734 --> 09:58.701
with your husband this morning?

10:01.300 --> 10:03.998
She's just married Xavier.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.198
Adam was their best man.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.832
Can you tell us anything about
the relationship between them?

10:10.834 --> 10:13.232
Between Eleanor and Adam?

10:13.234 --> 10:15.432
Friends.

10:15.434 --> 10:16.899
He's friends with Xavier,
really.

10:16.901 --> 10:19.899
Xavier's a pediatrician too.

10:19.901 --> 10:22.932
I introduced Eleanor to Xavier.

10:22.934 --> 10:25.899
She's a family friend.

10:25.901 --> 10:28.899
I used to babysit her.

10:28.901 --> 10:31.332
Why would...?

10:31.334 --> 10:33.767
I can't believe she'd do that.

10:45.901 --> 10:49.665
Okay, Sasha I.D.'d the caller
as Eleanor Kemp,

10:49.667 --> 10:52.998
wife of Adam's good friend
and colleague Xavier Kemp.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.300
You played her the call?

10:55.801 --> 10:57.565
So you told her
her husband was dead,

10:57.567 --> 10:59.031
and then you dropped
the bombshell

10:59.033 --> 11:01.332
that he'd been having an affair
with his best mate's wife?

11:01.334 --> 11:04.165
Well, I didn't know who he was
having the affair with.

11:04.167 --> 11:05.565
That's not the point.

11:05.567 --> 11:06.832
I got the result.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.699
Right, we're off to speak
to the victim's mother,

11:09.701 --> 11:11.599
see if she can shed any light
on the relationship

11:11.601 --> 11:12.966
between her two sons.

11:12.968 --> 11:15.534
And to tell her her son's dead.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.298
My husband just died.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.968
We heard.
We're so sorry.

11:39.501 --> 11:42.165
Six months from being told
he was dying.

11:42.167 --> 11:43.767
To the day.

11:46.267 --> 11:48.367
Married him when I was 19.

11:51.300 --> 11:52.934
Take a seat.

11:54.067 --> 11:57.098
Um, the funeral was yesterday.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.232
That's why the house
is such a tip.

11:59.234 --> 12:04.899
I'm... I'm sorry to tell you
we have some difficult news.

12:04.901 --> 12:07.332
Unfortunately, your son Adam

12:07.334 --> 12:11.334
was found dead this morning
at his home.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.200
And we have reason to believe
that he was murdered.

12:19.968 --> 12:23.332
Is there any other
family I could call for you?

12:23.334 --> 12:24.934
Sammy.

12:26.234 --> 12:28.367
Do you have a number for him?

12:30.400 --> 12:32.665
He doesn't have one.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.734
Doesn't have a proper home.

12:37.801 --> 12:39.365
I tried.

12:39.367 --> 12:42.732
Fell in with a bad crowd,
started drinking.

12:42.734 --> 12:44.765
I tried, honest.

12:44.767 --> 12:46.966
We're not judging you.

12:46.968 --> 12:50.632
Charles, my husband,

12:50.634 --> 12:54.300
he said enough was enough.

12:54.367 --> 12:55.632
<i>Hello?</i>

12:55.634 --> 12:57.031
<i>What's the address
of the emergency?</i>

12:57.033 --> 12:59.198
<i>A-A boat on the Thames
near Jessops Lane.</i>

12:59.200 --> 13:00.665
<i>It's called</i> Nieuwe Zorg.

13:00.667 --> 13:02.565
<i>What's the phone number
you're calling from?</i>

13:02.567 --> 13:04.565
- <i>I-I don't know.</i>
- <i>What's happened?</i>

13:04.567 --> 13:06.065
<i>He's dead!
I don't know! He's dead!</i>

13:06.067 --> 13:07.699
<i>Okay, just try and stay...</i>

13:07.701 --> 13:09.532
Who's dead?

13:09.534 --> 13:11.131
- <i>What's your name?</i>
- <i>I-I can't.</i>

13:15.934 --> 13:18.332
We were told Adam and Sammy
had a falling out

13:18.334 --> 13:20.031
at your husband's funeral.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.432
Who told you?

13:21.434 --> 13:23.298
Did you see it?

13:23.300 --> 13:25.799
Well, they were always bickering
when they were growing up.

13:25.801 --> 13:28.067
It was nothing
out of the ordinary.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.367
My poor boy.

13:36.701 --> 13:38.868
My poor little boy.

13:44.701 --> 13:45.998
Eleanor Kemp, I'm arresting you

13:46.000 --> 13:48.098
on suspicion of the murder
of Adam Garrick.

13:48.100 --> 13:49.499
Whoa!
What the hell is going on?

13:49.501 --> 13:51.632
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

13:51.634 --> 13:53.098
if you do not mention
when questioned

13:53.100 --> 13:54.899
something which you later
rely on in court.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.465
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

13:56.467 --> 13:58.334
Come on.
Let's go.

14:02.834 --> 14:05.634
Thank goodness Charles
didn't have to deal with this.

14:10.567 --> 14:12.131
We need to speak to Sammy.

14:12.133 --> 14:15.067
How did you track him down
for the funeral?

14:16.267 --> 14:18.131
Uh...

14:18.133 --> 14:19.799
The hostel.

14:19.801 --> 14:22.031
Yeah, where is it?

14:22.033 --> 14:25.398
Um, King's Cross.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.701
I have it
written down somewhere.

14:42.334 --> 14:45.932
The mobile number saved
in the victim's phone as "Bob"

14:45.934 --> 14:47.534
belongs to Eleanor Kemp.

14:48.701 --> 14:51.866
She's admitted to making
the 999 call.

14:51.868 --> 14:54.365
Okay, you keep
trawling the hostels for Sammy,

14:54.367 --> 14:57.601
and let's go and see what
Eleanor has to say for herself.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.265
I rang Adam just before 10:00.

15:06.267 --> 15:07.732
He sounded really upset,

15:07.734 --> 15:10.966
so I said I'd go over in the
morning when I came off shift.

15:10.968 --> 15:15.198
I'm a nurse at St. Martha's.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.131
Sasha was working extra hours,

15:17.133 --> 15:19.934
and I didn't like the idea
of him being alone.

15:22.567 --> 15:25.765
Can you explain why your number
is saved as "Bob"

15:25.767 --> 15:27.167
in Adam's phone?

15:28.667 --> 15:30.398
Is it?

15:30.400 --> 15:33.801
Or why you wouldn't give your
name when you made the 999 call?

15:38.534 --> 15:42.634
I didn't kill him.
He was already dead.

15:42.701 --> 15:45.131
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

15:45.133 --> 15:47.200
I love Xavier.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.332
You should never
have played that phone call

15:55.334 --> 15:56.365
in front of Xavier.

15:56.367 --> 15:58.065
It was confidential.

15:58.067 --> 16:00.732
He wasn't home
when I started it.

16:00.734 --> 16:01.832
It was unintentional.

16:01.834 --> 16:03.599
He shouldn't have done that,
should he?

16:03.601 --> 16:06.065
It was bound to come out at
some stage in the investigation.

16:06.067 --> 16:07.599
I should have been the one
to tell him.

16:07.601 --> 16:09.131
I'm gonna make a complaint.

16:09.133 --> 16:11.632
Well, you're totally
within your rights.

16:11.634 --> 16:13.699
But let's talk about it
after the interview, okay,

16:13.701 --> 16:16.131
and then you can explain
in detail

16:16.133 --> 16:18.565
how you got involved with
your husband's best friend

16:18.567 --> 16:21.033
and... and how we should have
handled that.

16:29.667 --> 16:31.532
I've trawled all the hostels
and hospitals.

16:31.534 --> 16:33.232
No sign of Sammy Garrick.

16:33.234 --> 16:36.432
Yeah, needle in a haystack,
finding a homeless person.

16:36.434 --> 16:38.832
I did have another idea.

16:38.834 --> 16:43.799
The witness
in the Tom Pryce case... Amber.

16:43.801 --> 16:46.501
She's in and out of hostels
and might be able to help.

16:47.934 --> 16:50.200
It's a long shot,
but give it a go.

16:52.834 --> 16:56.968
I got off the DLR around 7:30
and walked to the boat.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.968
I thought he was mucking around,
pretending to be asleep.

17:05.032 --> 17:07.434
So I got into bed with him.

17:12.367 --> 17:15.665
- He was cold.
- It was horrible.

17:15.666 --> 17:19.601
If he was already dead,
how did you get in?

17:26.367 --> 17:30.701
He gave me a set of keys
for whenever Sasha was working.

17:33.300 --> 17:37.232
Did Xavier or Sasha know
about your affair with Adam?

17:37.234 --> 17:38.198
No!

17:38.200 --> 17:40.532
No, no, absolutely not,
honestly.

17:40.534 --> 17:43.868
There's no way
either of them knew.

17:45.834 --> 17:48.400
Until all of this.

18:12.133 --> 18:15.031
I thought you'd be in bed.

18:15.033 --> 18:17.432
Early bird.

18:17.434 --> 18:20.400
I didn't think
I'd hear from you again.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.398
You're a witness to a murder.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.234
I like you,
but it wouldn't be right.

18:28.234 --> 18:29.567
For now.

18:30.767 --> 18:32.267
I can wait.

18:35.334 --> 18:37.298
So...

18:37.300 --> 18:39.567
You wanted to see me.

18:41.300 --> 18:44.265
We're looking for someone.

18:44.267 --> 18:46.665
The last place he stayed
was a hostel in King's Cross,

18:46.667 --> 18:50.265
but he could be squatting,
sleeping rough.

18:50.267 --> 18:52.200
I wondered if you might be able
to help me out.

18:53.501 --> 18:55.834
Business, not pleasure, then.

18:58.334 --> 19:00.667
Like I said, we can't.

19:01.934 --> 19:03.434
<i>You</i> can't.

19:07.968 --> 19:09.334
I'm sorry.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.300
I shouldn't have called.

19:15.834 --> 19:18.734
Wait.
What's his name?

19:25.400 --> 19:26.632
Where are we at, Rob?

19:26.634 --> 19:28.866
Right, there's four sets
of prints found

19:28.868 --> 19:30.699
on the kitchen counter.

19:30.701 --> 19:32.832
Sasha and Adam's, Eleanor Kemp,

19:32.834 --> 19:34.565
and Sammy Garrick...
Adam's brother.

19:34.567 --> 19:37.799
His prints came up on PNC.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.834
The elusive brother.

19:40.968 --> 19:42.699
And a clear
size-11 shoe print

19:42.701 --> 19:44.467
was lifted from the deck
by the front door.

19:45.567 --> 19:49.367
Doesn't appear to fit any
of the victim's shoes, though.

19:50.567 --> 19:51.565
Where's this?

19:51.567 --> 19:54.265
This is Jessops Lane.

19:54.267 --> 19:56.265
The road leading down
to the towpath.

19:56.267 --> 19:58.198
That's Xavier Kemp,
Eleanor's husband,

19:58.200 --> 19:59.832
at 7:40 this morning.

19:59.834 --> 20:01.298
What's he doing there?

20:01.300 --> 20:04.665
Maybe he knew about the affair
all along, caught them at it.

20:04.667 --> 20:05.832
Do we know where he is?

20:05.834 --> 20:07.499
Outside, waiting for his wife.

20:07.501 --> 20:09.367
Let's lift him.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.465
His dad had died.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.465
I thought
he might need to talk.

20:20.467 --> 20:22.198
So early?

20:22.200 --> 20:25.067
Once we're at work,
there's never time.

20:26.734 --> 20:30.499
I saw Eleanor leave and assumed
Sasha must have been there.

20:30.501 --> 20:34.634
I didn't want to disturb them,
so I walked home.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.065
It's quite a walk.

20:38.067 --> 20:40.198
I've run the London Marathon,
mate.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.701
I can manage a few miles.

20:46.501 --> 20:48.801
Look, what's Eleanor saying?
Have you released her?

20:56.067 --> 21:00.131
- Thanks for this.
- Yeah, well, I have my uses.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.232
Proper digs.

21:02.234 --> 21:04.465
Original features,
high ceilings.

21:04.467 --> 21:05.799
Bit drafty, though!

21:05.801 --> 21:07.198
Have you ever
had to sleep here?

21:07.200 --> 21:09.198
Careful.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.033
That caring thing you do
can give off the wrong vibe.

21:13.667 --> 21:15.265
Come on, then.

21:15.267 --> 21:17.298
- I'll take it from here.
- Oh, please!

21:17.300 --> 21:18.699
As if they're gonna talk
to a copper.

21:18.701 --> 21:20.065
How would they know?

21:20.067 --> 21:21.365
Yeah, right.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.300
- Amber, don't...
- Hello?!

21:24.567 --> 21:25.801
Hello?!

21:27.767 --> 21:29.300
Right.

21:30.334 --> 21:31.599
Sammy. Garrick.

21:31.601 --> 21:33.801
Sammy?
Anyone know Sammy Garrick?

21:36.400 --> 21:38.465
Hello?
Does anyone know Sammy?

21:38.467 --> 21:41.665
Sammy Garrick?
No?

21:41.667 --> 21:44.200
All right, mate,
do you know Sammy Garrick?

21:47.334 --> 21:48.665
Sammy?

21:48.667 --> 21:50.234
Sammy Garrick?

21:51.267 --> 21:53.198
He's going outside!

21:53.200 --> 21:56.167
Control, urgent assistance!
T.D.C. Billie Fitzgerald.

22:01.167 --> 22:03.998
I'm arresting you
for the murder of your brother!

22:04.000 --> 22:06.031
You don't
have to say anything...

22:06.033 --> 22:07.832
- Move away!
- Get off me!

22:07.834 --> 22:09.232
Move away!

22:09.234 --> 22:12.432
Sammy Garrick, I'm arresting you
for obstructing a police officer

22:12.434 --> 22:13.832
in the execution
of their duties.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.398
You do not have to say anything,

22:15.400 --> 22:18.098
but anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.031
What are you talking about
my brother?

22:36.334 --> 22:38.665
Don't you ever
do anything like that again.

22:38.667 --> 22:41.334
Huh?
I'll take that as a thank-you.

22:42.968 --> 22:45.165
How can you give me
all this grief?

22:45.167 --> 22:46.532
I got him for you, didn't I?

22:46.534 --> 22:47.968
Yeah, I could have
handled it myself.

22:49.834 --> 22:52.499
"Cheers, Amber. I'm so happy
you were there to help."

22:52.501 --> 22:54.031
You shouldn't be
anywhere near this.

22:54.033 --> 22:56.601
If Sammy makes a complaint,
I'm in deep trouble.

22:58.701 --> 23:00.801
It's not funny.

23:02.467 --> 23:04.332
That's my sarge.

23:04.334 --> 23:06.267
This was a mistake.

23:10.901 --> 23:12.365
All right, Billie?

23:12.367 --> 23:13.799
Yeah, fine.

23:13.801 --> 23:15.601
Nice work finding him.

23:25.534 --> 23:28.499
So Sammy's shoe print is a match
for the fresh one we found

23:28.501 --> 23:29.832
on the deck of the boat.

23:29.834 --> 23:32.031
CCTV?

23:32.033 --> 23:33.832
Nothing yet.

23:33.834 --> 23:35.701
I still think Xavier's
our front-runner.

23:37.133 --> 23:40.365
I think he killed Adam, left,
and watched Eleanor arrive.

23:40.367 --> 23:42.365
But why would Xavier
tuck him up like that

23:42.367 --> 23:44.365
if he thought that Adam
was sleeping with his wife?

23:44.367 --> 23:46.465
See if the medical examiner

23:46.467 --> 23:49.432
thinks Sammy's sober enough
to interview yet.

23:49.434 --> 23:51.901
Maybe we've got
two front-runners.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.265
So, Sammy,

23:59.267 --> 24:01.866
when was the last time
you saw your brother?

24:01.868 --> 24:05.365
He stropped off about 5:00ish.

24:05.367 --> 24:07.367
From the funeral?

24:11.834 --> 24:13.868
Why did he strop off?

24:17.634 --> 24:19.667
You know this, or else
I wouldn't be sitting here.

24:23.234 --> 24:24.734
The usual.

24:25.801 --> 24:27.866
Him telling me
what a loser I am,

24:27.868 --> 24:31.398
how I've got
no one else to blame but myself

24:31.400 --> 24:33.499
for getting into drink
after I'd been inside.

24:33.501 --> 24:35.799
So you were angry with him
when he left?

24:35.801 --> 24:38.033
Not angry enough to kill him.

24:39.234 --> 24:41.634
You... You haven't seen
each other for years. Why?

24:43.367 --> 24:44.834
He's an idiot.

24:45.934 --> 24:47.567
Were you close as kids?

24:48.934 --> 24:51.499
We got on okay.

24:51.501 --> 24:53.100
What happened?

24:55.334 --> 24:57.699
- Our lives took different paths.
- Meaning?

24:57.701 --> 25:00.966
Look, I don't know, but I...
I didn't kill him, okay?

25:00.968 --> 25:03.567
I don't... I don't even know
where he lives.

25:07.801 --> 25:11.432
Your shoe print was found on
the deck of your brother's boat,

25:11.434 --> 25:15.632
and your fingerprint was lifted
from a glass inside the boat,

25:15.634 --> 25:18.133
and you've just told us
you don't know where he lives.

25:19.968 --> 25:23.131
And we... we didn't mention
that your brother's body

25:23.133 --> 25:26.767
was found at his home address,
but you seem to know that.

25:30.133 --> 25:32.565
Okay, I... I went there,

25:32.567 --> 25:36.801
but I swear
he was already dead.

25:37.801 --> 25:39.799
How did you get in?

25:39.801 --> 25:41.599
The door was open.

25:41.601 --> 25:46.866
Oh, so someone else killed him
and left the door wide open?

25:46.868 --> 25:48.767
Well, why didn't you
tell us that from the start?

25:51.634 --> 25:54.234
'Cause I knew you'd try
and pin it on me.

26:00.968 --> 26:02.699
It can't be happening again,

26:02.701 --> 26:04.632
I ain't taking the blame
for him again.

26:04.634 --> 26:08.732
I ain't. I ain't.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.267
I ain't.
Ain't taking the blame.

26:14.501 --> 26:17.665
So Sammy's admitted
to being there,

26:17.667 --> 26:18.966
has form for ABH,

26:18.968 --> 26:20.565
a troubled history
with his brother,

26:20.567 --> 26:23.998
and a fingerprint and
shoe print match at the scene.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.398
And he lied continually
throughout the interview.

26:26.400 --> 26:29.565
He's about as solid a suspect
as you can get.

26:29.567 --> 26:32.532
He obviously had problems
with his brother.

26:32.534 --> 26:35.565
Why did he tuck him up
so lovingly?

26:35.567 --> 26:38.632
I'm not as convinced
about Xavier now.

26:38.634 --> 26:43.031
All we've got on him is CCTV
footage of when Eleanor left.

26:43.033 --> 26:45.165
I mean, there's no forensics
placing him in the boat

26:45.167 --> 26:46.499
or on his clothes.

26:46.501 --> 26:48.499
What about Eleanor's clothes?

26:48.501 --> 26:50.198
There's nothing.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.934
Let's bail Xavier and Eleanor.

27:21.667 --> 27:25.601
How about you start telling me
the truth, honey? Hmm?

27:33.767 --> 27:35.332
Five months!

27:35.334 --> 27:37.565
You only managed five months!

27:37.567 --> 27:39.966
I genuinely thought
you loved me. I'm an idiot.

27:39.968 --> 27:42.868
I do!
I love you so much!

27:54.267 --> 27:56.432
What did you do?

27:56.434 --> 27:57.434
What?

28:00.067 --> 28:02.534
What did you do to Adam?!

28:04.501 --> 28:06.165
You cow!

28:06.167 --> 28:08.599
You crazy cheating cow!

28:08.601 --> 28:09.767
Come here!

28:45.501 --> 28:47.367
Hello?
Help me, please!

28:51.734 --> 28:54.198
Yeah, the... the multistory
car park

28:54.200 --> 28:55.734
just off Vallance Road.

29:03.934 --> 29:06.734
Eleanor called.
Xavier's lost it.

29:17.100 --> 29:19.432
They're in a car park
off Vallance Road.

29:19.434 --> 29:20.832
Is she hurt?

29:20.834 --> 29:22.234
No idea.

29:46.534 --> 29:49.098
No! No!

29:49.100 --> 29:51.067
Help! Help!

29:56.434 --> 29:58.198
Were you seeing him
before we got married?

29:58.200 --> 29:59.632
Don't lie to me!

29:59.634 --> 30:01.866
Please, Xavier, don't do this.

30:01.868 --> 30:04.031
I'm sorry!
It was a stupid mistake!

30:04.033 --> 30:05.501
I wish it had never happened!

30:11.234 --> 30:13.332
Please, no! I'm sorry!
I love you!

30:13.334 --> 30:14.499
I'm sorry!

30:14.501 --> 30:17.265
For better or worse.
Remember?

30:17.267 --> 30:19.799
It doesn't get much worse
than this, does it?

30:20.801 --> 30:21.801
Help!

30:25.300 --> 30:26.298
Help!

30:26.300 --> 30:27.799
- Please!
- Stop! Stop!

30:27.801 --> 30:29.432
All right, Xavier, calm down.

30:29.434 --> 30:31.432
She thinks I killed Adam,
but I didn't.

30:31.434 --> 30:33.298
- I didn't. I'm not a killer!
- Okay, mate.

30:33.300 --> 30:34.732
We can sort this out,
all right?

30:34.734 --> 30:37.465
He was so clever.
It was him, not me.

30:37.467 --> 30:39.465
Don't blame it all on Adam!

30:39.467 --> 30:41.398
He could make anyone
do anything.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.532
I hate him for tricking me,

30:43.534 --> 30:45.765
for making me do something
I didn't want to to do!

30:45.767 --> 30:47.398
Just come away from the edge.
All right?

30:47.400 --> 30:48.499
She's scared.
Come on.

30:48.501 --> 30:50.332
Let her go, Xavier.
Let her go.

30:50.334 --> 30:51.834
Come on.

31:33.467 --> 31:36.534
How did Adam feel about
his brother, Sammy?

31:37.534 --> 31:40.599
He didn't talk about Sammy much.

31:40.601 --> 31:44.734
All I ever really got was
how stupid and weak he was.

31:45.868 --> 31:50.232
I saw on file that Adam
and Sammy were arrested together

31:50.234 --> 31:52.765
for dangerous driving offenses
when they were teenagers.

31:52.767 --> 31:54.899
It put him off forever.

31:54.901 --> 31:56.932
Adam never touched alcohol
after that.

31:56.934 --> 31:59.899
And Sammy said
that he didn't start drinking

31:59.901 --> 32:01.765
until after he was inside.

32:01.767 --> 32:03.701
Well, I find that
hard to believe.

32:04.901 --> 32:06.732
Okay.

32:06.734 --> 32:09.732
Why would Sammy lie about
when he started drinking?

32:09.734 --> 32:11.365
There is <i>something.</i>

32:11.367 --> 32:14.966
Sammy was muttering weird stuff
on his way back to custody.

32:14.968 --> 32:17.998
He was like, "This can't
be happening. Not again.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.699
I ain't taking the blame
for him this time."

32:20.701 --> 32:22.899
Helpful.

32:22.901 --> 32:24.601
Cheers.

32:31.367 --> 32:32.732
What did you mean...

32:32.734 --> 32:35.298
"I'm not taking the blame
for him this time"?

32:35.300 --> 32:36.567
Nothing.

32:37.734 --> 32:40.400
Do you know who killed Adam?

32:46.868 --> 32:48.765
You were there.

32:48.767 --> 32:51.332
I don't...
I don't know anything.

32:51.334 --> 32:54.332
Did you see someone else
kill Adam?

32:54.334 --> 32:56.065
No.

32:56.067 --> 32:57.699
Come on,
you weren't on your own.

32:57.701 --> 32:59.632
Who was with you?
Sammy, what did you see?

32:59.634 --> 33:00.765
Shut up!

33:00.767 --> 33:02.501
Okay, I killed him.

33:07.501 --> 33:08.901
I killed him.

33:16.467 --> 33:18.565
The CPS
have agreed to charge Xavier

33:18.567 --> 33:19.866
for what he did to Eleanor,

33:19.868 --> 33:23.365
but I'm convinced he had nothing
to do with Adam's murder.

33:23.367 --> 33:24.899
Sammy confessed.

33:24.901 --> 33:26.198
Well, that's a result.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.699
Yeah, but he's lying.

33:27.701 --> 33:31.033
What I don't know is... is why.

33:35.567 --> 33:39.265
Well, Xavier and Eleanor said
that Adam was very persuasive.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.866
He could make anyone
do anything.

33:41.868 --> 33:43.765
I mean, Eleanor is baffled
at how she ended up

33:43.767 --> 33:45.932
even having an affair with him.

33:45.934 --> 33:48.501
Seems like he was
a skilled manipulator.

33:58.100 --> 33:59.932
You've got evidence
and a confession

33:59.934 --> 34:01.334
What more do you want?

34:03.567 --> 34:05.667
An explanation.

34:07.234 --> 34:09.665
Do you know what I think?

34:09.667 --> 34:12.364
I think
back when you were teenagers,

34:12.367 --> 34:15.100
Adam was driving,
and you took the hit.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.699
I've checked the records.

34:18.701 --> 34:21.799
Adam was five times over
the limit, and you were sober.

34:21.801 --> 34:23.065
And you didn't start drinking

34:23.067 --> 34:25.766
until you'd spent time
in juvenile detention.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.900
Adam was good
at manipulating you, wasn't he?

34:32.400 --> 34:35.232
But what I don't get is why
you took the blame for him

34:35.234 --> 34:37.400
for such a huge thing.

34:42.132 --> 34:47.297
'Cause he was clever.
He was... He was going to uni.

34:47.300 --> 34:51.234
I had, um... I had less to lose.

34:52.667 --> 34:53.899
It weren't a big deal,

34:53.900 --> 34:55.998
but then
the girl in the car we hit,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.267
she died three weeks later.

35:00.901 --> 35:02.467
All blew up.

35:04.801 --> 35:07.868
Adam said he'd kill himself
if he went inside.

35:10.901 --> 35:13.634
So you've resented him
for years.

35:16.467 --> 35:18.133
Does anyone else
know the truth?

35:23.200 --> 35:25.732
Well, that goes for motive,

35:25.734 --> 35:29.232
but, you know, what I don't
understand is the timing.

35:29.234 --> 35:31.165
I mean, why did you choose

35:31.167 --> 35:33.501
the day of your dad's funeral
to do it?

35:34.667 --> 35:36.367
I was drunk.

35:38.834 --> 35:40.767
Did you love him?

35:41.901 --> 35:43.632
Adam?

35:43.634 --> 35:45.599
Nah.

35:45.601 --> 35:50.167
I hated him.
He, uh... He ruined my life.

35:54.267 --> 35:57.501
How did you leave your brother
after you killed him?

35:59.434 --> 36:01.332
In bed.

36:01.334 --> 36:03.165
Under the cover.

36:03.167 --> 36:04.968
Why?

36:08.334 --> 36:09.699
'Cause it wouldn't be
so upsetting

36:09.701 --> 36:11.434
when his missus found him.

36:13.267 --> 36:14.534
Okay.

36:51.734 --> 36:53.599
Do you know what?
I've actually just seen her.

36:53.601 --> 36:54.801
Thank you.

37:00.334 --> 37:01.866
Hello, Sasha.

37:01.868 --> 37:03.432
Hello again.

37:03.434 --> 37:05.632
Um, I-I did try you at home.

37:05.634 --> 37:07.031
I need to keep busy.

37:07.033 --> 37:08.866
Yeah, it's a shock.
I know.

37:08.868 --> 37:11.765
What?
My husband being murdered?

37:11.767 --> 37:13.899
Or the fact he was having
an affair with someone

37:13.901 --> 37:15.667
I thought was a friend?

37:18.801 --> 37:20.298
Sorry.

37:20.300 --> 37:22.565
None of this is your fault.

37:22.567 --> 37:25.131
Do you have any idea
of who killed Adam yet?

37:25.133 --> 37:27.634
Well, I-I'm getting there.

37:29.100 --> 37:31.966
When, um, Adam
and his brother, Sammy,

37:31.968 --> 37:33.398
had an argument
at the funeral...

37:33.400 --> 37:36.565
I told you. I don't know
what they were fighting about.

37:36.567 --> 37:39.131
But i-it was pretty intense?

37:39.133 --> 37:40.799
Very.

37:40.801 --> 37:43.232
Do you know how it ended?

37:43.234 --> 37:46.599
Um, Adam's mum
had to split them up.

37:46.601 --> 37:48.133
Anne?

37:49.133 --> 37:51.565
Do you think she heard
what they were fighting about?

37:51.567 --> 37:53.665
She must have done.

37:53.667 --> 37:55.434
Yeah.

37:57.667 --> 37:59.334
Okay.

38:02.501 --> 38:07.098
The body was... was tucked up
in... in bed

38:07.100 --> 38:09.031
and... and the DNA
from the lipstick

38:09.033 --> 38:11.133
didn't match Eleanor or Sasha.

38:12.767 --> 38:16.934
It was a kiss on the forehead.
That is a maternal gesture.

38:19.601 --> 38:21.968
It has to be the mother.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.866
Yeah, I-I think that Sammy
is covering for her

38:25.868 --> 38:27.632
the way he covered
for his brother.

38:27.634 --> 38:29.332
Why would she kill
her own son?

38:29.334 --> 38:32.732
'Cause she found out that Sammy
took the blame for Adam.

38:32.734 --> 38:34.365
Maybe that's what
they were arguing about

38:34.367 --> 38:35.699
at the funeral,
and she overheard.

38:35.701 --> 38:37.131
Exactly.

38:37.133 --> 38:39.699
All right.
Tread carefully.

38:39.701 --> 38:42.031
She's just lost two family
members. If you're wrong...

38:42.033 --> 38:43.167
No, I'm not.

38:53.367 --> 38:54.400
You all right?

39:08.300 --> 39:11.365
Oh. Um, my neighbor Pauline
has invited me up for supper.

39:11.367 --> 39:13.332
She didn't like the thought
of me being on my own.

39:13.334 --> 39:15.665
We have a suspect in custody.

39:15.667 --> 39:17.133
Sammy.

39:18.801 --> 39:20.365
My Sammy?

39:20.367 --> 39:21.734
He's admitted to killing Adam.

39:24.033 --> 39:26.532
He didn't kill him.
He didn't.

39:26.534 --> 39:28.198
Look, you just have to
believe me.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.465
You seem very sure.

39:29.467 --> 39:33.033
Sammy had nothing
to do with it.

39:37.868 --> 39:39.300
It was me.

39:41.501 --> 39:43.067
Let him go.

39:45.167 --> 39:47.033
I'm the one who did it.

39:50.501 --> 39:52.234
What did you use?

39:53.300 --> 39:55.601
You'll find it in the kitchen.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.565
Anne Garrick, I'm arresting you

40:04.567 --> 40:06.866
on suspicion
of the murder of Adam Garrick.

40:06.868 --> 40:09.198
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

40:09.200 --> 40:10.765
if you do not mention
when questioned

40:10.767 --> 40:13.400
something which
you later rely on in court.

40:21.334 --> 40:23.701
I'm a bad mother.

40:24.868 --> 40:27.133
A bad, useless mother.

40:28.601 --> 40:31.899
A good mother
would have seen it.

40:31.901 --> 40:33.901
Seen what?

40:36.934 --> 40:40.265
Adam lapped up
his da's affection.

40:40.267 --> 40:42.866
No guilt, nothing.

40:42.868 --> 40:45.701
All those years, all that time.

40:48.234 --> 40:50.131
Sammy tried to tell me once
that it wasn't him

40:50.133 --> 40:52.532
should have gone to prison.

40:52.534 --> 40:55.198
I threw him out.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.367
It was Adam, not Sam.

40:59.701 --> 41:02.365
When did you find out?

41:02.367 --> 41:05.432
They were fighting
at the funeral.

41:05.434 --> 41:07.499
I blamed Sammy, as usual,

41:07.501 --> 41:11.465
but I wanted to sort it out
once and for all.

41:11.467 --> 41:15.332
So that's why you went
to Adam's houseboat?

41:15.334 --> 41:19.765
You see, Charles had given up,
but I didn't want to give up.

41:19.767 --> 41:21.632
There was only
the three of us.

41:21.634 --> 41:23.832
I don't have any other family.

41:23.834 --> 41:27.599
And that's when
it all come out.

41:27.601 --> 41:30.465
And Adam laughed.

41:30.467 --> 41:32.966
He laughed!

41:32.968 --> 41:35.131
I was so angry.

41:35.133 --> 41:37.398
I wanted to stop him!

41:37.400 --> 41:39.932
And I picked up
the nearest thing to me,

41:39.934 --> 41:44.501
and it was one of them things
that you bash up spices with.

41:46.300 --> 41:47.998
I didn't mean
to kill him.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.801
I wouldn't hurt my son.

41:51.968 --> 41:54.599
I don't know what happened.

41:54.601 --> 41:56.734
I was just so angry.

42:00.567 --> 42:02.334
Then what did you do?

42:05.634 --> 42:07.067
Well...

42:08.334 --> 42:10.866
I didn't want to leave him
on the floor.

42:10.868 --> 42:13.265
I couldn't leave him like that.

42:13.267 --> 42:16.098
And Sammy was outside
sitting on the deck.

42:16.100 --> 42:17.665
He was drunk.

42:17.667 --> 42:20.534
Didn't realize at first
that Adam was dead.

42:25.400 --> 42:29.165
I wanted to put him to bed.

42:29.167 --> 42:32.065
He was my little boy.

42:32.067 --> 42:34.501
Didn't want him to get cold.

42:53.567 --> 42:55.899
Some new evidence
has been found

42:55.901 --> 42:59.300
by the officers investigating
my wife's disappearance.

43:00.534 --> 43:02.332
Now, as we all know,

43:02.334 --> 43:04.966
Sarah's bag was found
at Tom Pryce's flat.

43:04.968 --> 43:06.801
Question has always been,
how did it get there?

43:08.767 --> 43:12.765
New CCTV footage shows a woman

43:12.767 --> 43:15.534
walking towards the flat
carrying Sarah's bag.

43:17.501 --> 43:19.031
Now, it's not the best picture,

43:19.033 --> 43:23.632
but do either of you
recognize her?

43:23.634 --> 43:25.334
No.

43:31.234 --> 43:35.534
Obviously we need to I.D. her
as a matter of urgency.

43:45.801 --> 43:46.799
You okay?

43:46.801 --> 43:48.667
Yeah, fine.
Just knackered.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.998
Hi, Amber.
It's me.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.665
Can you give me a ring back,
please?

44:12.667 --> 44:14.434
It's really, really important.
