WEBVTT

00:02.211 --> 00:04.946
Look at that.
Dogs in the diner.

00:04.948 --> 00:08.366
Where are we, Paris?

00:08.368 --> 00:12.537
'Cause if we are, I'm gonna
stop wearing deodorant.

00:12.539 --> 00:14.840
Did you guys see
that adorable dog?

00:14.842 --> 00:17.209
You mean the one leaking
rabies all over the table

00:17.211 --> 00:18.710
while people are trying to eat?

00:18.712 --> 00:20.212
She said
he's allowed to be in here.

00:20.214 --> 00:22.464
He's her registered
emotional companion.

00:22.466 --> 00:25.884
Her registered
full-of-crap what?

00:25.886 --> 00:28.053
He's got one of those
official vests that says

00:28.055 --> 00:29.688
"don't pet me,
I'm working."

00:29.690 --> 00:32.756
I have a shirt that says
"federal bikini inspector,"

00:32.759 --> 00:35.810
but there is simply no such
branch of the U.S. government.

00:38.065 --> 00:40.649
Hi, so, uh,
what the hell is this?

00:40.651 --> 00:43.235
Excuse me?
I don't understand.

00:43.237 --> 00:44.786
Dogs aren't allowed
in the diner.

00:44.788 --> 00:46.538
Oh, he's legally allowed
to be here.

00:46.540 --> 00:49.107
He's my registered
emotional companion.

00:49.109 --> 00:52.460
You mean you don't
have a boyfriend.

00:52.462 --> 00:54.629
No, I suffer from anxiety.

00:54.631 --> 00:57.048
You mean you don't
want to eat alone.

00:57.050 --> 00:59.134
No, I have a note
from a doctor.

00:59.136 --> 01:03.588
You mean you have a printer
and the Internet.

01:03.590 --> 01:06.474
Admit it, and the dog can stay.

01:06.476 --> 01:10.061
It's really hard meeting guys.

01:10.063 --> 01:13.798
There's a good boy.
I'll get you a cookie.

01:30.374 --> 01:33.108
Is it just me,
or does Han sound kind of sexy

01:33.110 --> 01:35.177
when he speaks korean?

01:38.716 --> 01:41.967
Looks like Han,
sounds like Barry White.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.270
Who was that, Han?

01:45.272 --> 01:47.556
Do you have a hot,
new korean girlfriend?

01:47.558 --> 01:49.057
Yeah, someone
who really likes you

01:49.059 --> 01:50.809
and is $1.50
for the first minute

01:50.811 --> 01:52.594
and $2 for each
additional minute?

01:52.596 --> 01:56.264
I was talking to my mother!

01:56.266 --> 01:58.984
So... yes?

01:58.986 --> 02:01.987
I was not talking hot.
I was apologizing.

02:01.989 --> 02:03.822
She's still angry I left home.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.441
She thinks I'm freewheeling
American who takes drugs

02:06.443 --> 02:10.245
and has intercourse
with dirty kardashian.

02:12.114 --> 02:15.217
Does she know you buy
your sweaters at build-a-bear?

02:15.219 --> 02:18.720
Well, I don't know
a lot about the korean culture,

02:18.722 --> 02:20.806
but maybe you should
stand up for yourself

02:20.808 --> 02:22.641
and stop apologizing
to your mother.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.676
Yeah, what do you
even have to apologize for?

02:24.678 --> 02:27.896
You must have been
the easiest birth ever.

02:27.898 --> 02:32.017
She could've coughed you
into a catcher's mitt.

02:37.190 --> 02:38.690
I'm making a cappuccino,
you want one?

02:38.692 --> 02:40.609
Nope, I can't have
any caffeine.

02:40.611 --> 02:43.328
I have to keep my system clean.
I'm doing a drug trial tomorrow.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.996
Max, not one of those places

02:44.998 --> 02:46.331
where they use you
as a Guinea pig

02:46.333 --> 02:47.699
to test for side effects
of new drugs

02:47.701 --> 02:49.167
that go on the market?

02:49.169 --> 02:51.753
Or, as I like to call it,
getting paid $500

02:51.755 --> 02:53.488
to, uh, roll
the side effects dice

02:53.490 --> 02:56.258
and hope it lands
on hallucinations.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.960
I would never
do something like that.

02:58.962 --> 03:00.595
I consider my body a temple.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.798
Didn't I see
your "temple" eat a bag

03:02.800 --> 03:05.166
of flaming hot cheetos
two nights ago?

03:05.168 --> 03:07.018
And that was a huge mistake.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.837
I still have a little...

03:08.839 --> 03:12.140
Burny heinie.

03:12.142 --> 03:14.008
And besides, think of
all the people who are

03:14.010 --> 03:16.945
lowering their cholesterol
safely because of me.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.514
Or the people who aren't
taking klamitra because of me.

03:19.516 --> 03:21.199
I never heard of klamitra.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.518
You're welcome.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.153
I know klamitra.

03:25.155 --> 03:28.373
Sexy black woman
who teaches my spin class.

03:30.076 --> 03:31.827
Uh, hello, uh,
maybe you can help me.

03:31.829 --> 03:33.278
I'm looking
for Caroline Channing.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.547
I have a legal matter
to discuss with her.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.466
Never heard of her.
Never seen her.

03:37.468 --> 03:41.870
- Mr. Hutchinson?
- Never took an oath.

03:41.872 --> 03:45.157
Oh, my God,
Mr. Hutchinson, hi.

03:45.159 --> 03:47.008
I haven't seen you
since my father's scandal broke

03:47.010 --> 03:50.228
and they were dragging you
out of your law offices.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.514
Can I hug you?
I mean, it's been so long

03:52.516 --> 03:54.549
since I've seen anyone
from my old life.

03:54.551 --> 03:56.134
But, uh, not too hard.

03:56.136 --> 04:01.740
Ever since the scandal,
I've had acid reflux.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.992
Didn't you used to be taller?

04:03.994 --> 04:06.945
No, uh, prouder.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.564
Oh, uh, Mr. Hutchinson,
this is my friend, Max.

04:09.566 --> 04:12.250
Max, this is Leo Hutchinson,
one of my father's attorneys.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.869
Oh, I've never known a lawyer

04:13.871 --> 04:17.589
who wasn't
court-appointed for me.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.423
Well, except for
the ones on <i>Law & Order.</i>

04:19.426 --> 04:21.242
Have you ever
been on that show?

04:21.244 --> 04:23.929
No, I'm a real lawyer.

04:23.931 --> 04:27.766
You look like someone
who was on that show.

04:27.768 --> 04:28.884
Are you sure
you didn't represent

04:28.886 --> 04:32.304
the woman who ate her child?

04:32.306 --> 04:36.107
I've never represented
anyone who ate their child.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.610
On <i>Law & Order.</i>

04:38.612 --> 04:43.281
Caroline, I'm sorry
to drag you into this,

04:43.283 --> 04:46.568
but the prosecutor is asking
for you to give a deposition

04:46.570 --> 04:48.820
regarding your father's case.

04:48.822 --> 04:53.375
Anything I can do to help?
I'm pretty courtroom savvy.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.243
I mean, I haven't seen
every episode of <i>Law & Order,</i>

04:55.245 --> 04:57.879
just, like, 400 of them.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.799
For instance,
the, uh, judge's hammer?

05:00.801 --> 05:03.168
Not called a hammer.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.420
Reflux! Oh!

05:05.422 --> 05:06.805
Sorry.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.391
I just... I need to
take a rylindia.

05:09.393 --> 05:11.226
Ah, rylindia.
Does that work?

05:11.228 --> 05:16.181
- Hmm.
- You're welcome.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.934
Well, thank you for coming
all the way out here.

05:18.936 --> 05:21.152
I know I'm in good hands
with you representing me.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.489
Uh, well, Caroline, as much
as I would love to help you

05:24.491 --> 05:27.075
and your legal associate here,

05:27.077 --> 05:29.143
uh, the firm won't let me
do it for free.

05:29.145 --> 05:32.364
I mean, your father's case
bankrupted us practically,

05:32.366 --> 05:35.000
and my standard rate
is $1,100 an hour.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.836
You know I don't have
that kind of money.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.504
Last week,
I gave myself a bikini wax

05:39.506 --> 05:43.592
with duct tape
I stole from the diner.

05:43.594 --> 05:45.760
I'm gonna need
another rylindia.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.712
Oh, don't take two of those
in under an hour

05:47.714 --> 05:53.184
unless you want to have
an orgasm every time you yawn.

05:53.186 --> 05:57.138
You're welcome again.

05:58.891 --> 06:01.643
Mr. Hutchinson,
I need you to do this.

06:01.645 --> 06:04.312
You can make this go away
as easily as possible.

06:04.314 --> 06:05.981
Please don't make me beg.

06:05.983 --> 06:08.900
The floor's gross,
and my skirt's too short.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.368
Counselor, at this juncture,

06:10.370 --> 06:11.987
I am going to need to
take miss Channing

06:11.989 --> 06:17.191
and have a sidebar
over near the bar bar.

06:17.193 --> 06:18.827
How fun is this, by the way?

06:18.829 --> 06:20.295
I'm, like, your lawyer now.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.998
Oh, real fun.
About as fun as that bikini wax.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.252
And then I had to spend $14
on neosporin.

06:27.254 --> 06:31.222
Don't worry, I know how you
can make $500 in one night.

06:31.224 --> 06:35.977
I've been telling her that
since she got here.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.812
Max, I am not
doing a drug trial.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.547
Besides,
it's not enough money anyway.

06:39.549 --> 06:41.850
No, but after I put in my $500,

06:41.852 --> 06:44.069
plus we take $100
from the cupcake fund.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.604
You would do that for me?

06:46.606 --> 06:48.222
You know, I always thought
we'd have to use

06:48.224 --> 06:50.158
the cupcake money to get us
out of a legal problem.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.410
I just thought it'd be for you.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.280
Me too!

06:55.282 --> 06:58.533
Welcome aboard, drug buddy.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.755
I can't believe
I'm doing a drug trial.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.091
I won't even use stevia.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.526
It'll be fun!

07:07.528 --> 07:09.961
Just think of it as
a middle-school sleepover.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.913
But with drugs.

07:11.915 --> 07:15.634
Yeah,
a middle-school sleepover.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.769
So when you did this before,

07:17.771 --> 07:19.638
you never got
any side effects, right?

07:19.640 --> 07:24.491
Well, no negative ones.
I used to be an "a" cup.

07:26.229 --> 07:27.896
Wow, everybody looks so normal.

07:27.898 --> 07:30.649
This is more like
sorority row than skid row.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.150
Hi!
I'm Katie.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.985
Just found out
there's three to a room,

07:33.987 --> 07:36.321
and I was wondering if you guys
have chosen a roomie yet.

07:36.323 --> 07:37.873
Wait, there's three in a room?

07:37.875 --> 07:39.074
Yeah, I know.

07:39.076 --> 07:40.742
You want to be careful
who you get.

07:40.744 --> 07:43.161
Anyways,
I'm a self-mutilator,

07:43.163 --> 07:46.465
and, um, I was wondering if
you could keep an eye on me.

07:46.467 --> 07:49.501
Just wrestle anything
out of my hands that's sharp.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.136
Uh, you know what, Katie?

07:51.138 --> 07:53.288
We are
self-mutilators too.

07:53.290 --> 07:55.807
So, uh, we kind of
have our hands full.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.510
Yeah,
we're gonna be super-busy

07:58.512 --> 08:00.679
self-mutilating ourselves.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.347
No worries.

08:02.349 --> 08:05.934
Max, you should have told me
about the bed situation.

08:05.936 --> 08:08.303
Untested experimental drugs
is one thing,

08:08.305 --> 08:11.323
but three to a room?
That's barbaric!

08:11.325 --> 08:12.491
It'll be fine!

08:12.493 --> 08:14.192
We just have to pick
the right girl.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.446
What about, uh,
the one in the raincoat?

08:17.448 --> 08:18.813
She looks stuck-up,

08:18.815 --> 08:20.699
like she'd talk
about herself all night.

08:20.701 --> 08:25.670
Yeah, we already
got one of those.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.372
What about, uh...

08:27.374 --> 08:28.823
What about Bob Marley shirt?

08:28.825 --> 08:33.211
She looks like she smells.

08:33.212 --> 08:37.215
- Confirmed.
- Right there.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.967
That's who we want.
She looks smart

08:38.969 --> 08:40.385
and like she'd
mind her own business.

08:40.386 --> 08:44.188
Hey!
What are you up to?

08:44.191 --> 08:47.675
Nothing.
Just minding my own business.

08:47.677 --> 08:49.511
Hey, want to be our roommate?

08:49.513 --> 08:52.347
Oh, I just said yes
to a self-mutilator,

08:52.349 --> 08:53.848
but I can get out of it.

08:53.850 --> 08:57.903
She probably loves rejection.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.238
All right, ladies, listen up!

09:00.240 --> 09:02.207
- Hey, Max!
- Hi, Toby.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.742
Heads-up,
me, her, and, uh...

09:03.744 --> 09:04.876
Excuse me, what's your name?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.378
Oh, it's cool,

09:06.380 --> 09:07.879
we don't have to do,
like, the name thing.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.748
A girl after my own heart!

09:09.750 --> 09:11.666
- We're roommates.
- Got it.

09:11.668 --> 09:14.002
Now, since most of you
have done this before,

09:14.004 --> 09:15.170
I'll make it quick.

09:15.172 --> 09:16.972
Half of you will get a placebo.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.925
The other half will be a testing
a new drug called gladiva,

09:19.927 --> 09:24.396
and no, that's not my stage name
down at the clubs.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.731
Okay, possible side effects

09:26.733 --> 09:30.218
may occur over
the next 24 to 48 hours.

09:30.220 --> 09:32.854
They are...
Drum roll please...

09:32.856 --> 09:35.223
Headaches,
vomiting, flatulence,

09:35.225 --> 09:37.442
tongue-swelling,
suicidal thoughts...

09:37.444 --> 09:39.528
I'm having some right now.

09:39.530 --> 09:42.564
- ITW...
- Inability to walk.

09:42.566 --> 09:44.199
Mm, I hope we get that
'cause that's the only thing

09:44.201 --> 09:45.667
that's gonna keep me here.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.285
And ru...

09:47.287 --> 09:48.670
Relentless urination.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.589
Fatigue, seizures...

09:50.591 --> 09:55.126
Camel toe.

09:55.128 --> 09:58.930
I'm kidding.
That's my joke.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.248
That's his joke.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.300
Good,
'cause I was out the door.

10:02.302 --> 10:05.804
Also, TG, EB, CCS...

10:05.806 --> 10:07.305
You want me
to explain those to you?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.524
Not until you see one
happening to me.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.693
And A.L.

10:11.695 --> 10:15.230
Anal leakage.

10:15.232 --> 10:19.518
The <i>Grande Dame</i>
of side effects.

10:21.904 --> 10:24.105
Well, bottoms up.

10:24.107 --> 10:29.327
Max, don't say that
after "anal leakage."

10:30.630 --> 10:32.280
See? This is fun!

10:32.282 --> 10:35.300
Getting paid to eat cookies
and play the game of life.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.335
- Your turn.
- What's the point?

10:37.337 --> 10:39.137
Clearly, I've already
lost the game of life

10:39.139 --> 10:40.338
'cause I'm sitting
in a drug trial

10:40.340 --> 10:42.841
waiting for my "A" to "L".

10:42.843 --> 10:45.393
Well, if your "A"
does start to "L,"

10:45.395 --> 10:47.395
you're on the bottom bunk.

10:47.397 --> 10:50.982
I gotta pee.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.118
Ruh-roh.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.402
What?

10:54.404 --> 10:55.687
Mm, it's probably nothing,

10:55.689 --> 10:57.739
but she might be
experiencing RU.

10:57.741 --> 10:58.773
What's that again?

10:58.775 --> 11:00.442
Relentless urination.

11:00.444 --> 11:02.444
She just said she had to pee.

11:12.989 --> 11:15.823
Yeah, that's relentless.

11:19.713 --> 11:20.712
Are you okay?

11:20.714 --> 11:23.181
Yeah.

11:23.183 --> 11:27.385
"RU" sure?

11:27.387 --> 11:28.937
Okay, your turn to spin.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.388
No more games.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.390
I really want to be prepared
for this deposition.

11:32.392 --> 11:35.110
Can you read me the questions
Mr. Hutchinson sent?

11:35.112 --> 11:37.729
Mm-hmm.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.197
"State your full name."

11:39.199 --> 11:41.316
Caroline Wesbox Channing.

11:41.318 --> 11:44.069
Your middle name is "Wesbox"?

11:44.071 --> 11:45.820
It was my grandfather's name.

11:45.822 --> 11:48.573
It also might be a side effect.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.743
"I just slept with a dude
who gave me Wesbox!"

11:51.745 --> 11:54.329
Max, can you just ask me
the next question?

11:54.331 --> 11:56.798
Do you have any knowledge
of investor capital

11:56.800 --> 11:58.700
from the Channing
investment group

11:58.702 --> 12:00.535
being transferred
to offshore banks?

12:00.537 --> 12:02.203
I had no knowledge of it.

12:02.205 --> 12:04.939
- You're boring.
- I'm boring?

12:04.941 --> 12:06.641
I'm just saying,
I'd change the channel.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.143
This is a bad one.

12:08.145 --> 12:10.345
Max, it's not <i>Law & Order.</i>

12:10.347 --> 12:12.764
I'll say it isn't.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.766
Look, tomorrow,
you gotta give them something.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.401
Open your shirt,
hike up your skirt,

12:16.403 --> 12:19.220
show them your Wesbox.

12:19.222 --> 12:20.772
"Did you know anything
about your father

12:20.774 --> 12:23.742
- "illegally siphoning funds?"
- No.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.560
"Have you ever had
any conversations

12:25.562 --> 12:27.245
with your father regarding
said transactions?"

12:27.247 --> 12:28.446
No.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.833
"Is your ass leaking
right now?"

12:31.835 --> 12:35.036
No.

12:36.922 --> 12:41.409
Ruh-roh.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.885
Nope.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.725
How we doing, ladies?

12:56.727 --> 13:00.362
Any side effects?

13:05.434 --> 13:07.819
Max, are you awake?

13:07.821 --> 13:09.371
Max!

13:09.373 --> 13:13.324
Quiet, you're gonna
wake up Pissy Spacek.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.444
I can't sleep.
My hearts keeps racing.

13:16.446 --> 13:18.913
You should tell Toby.
It's probably a side effect.

13:18.915 --> 13:20.382
No, I'm nervous.

13:20.384 --> 13:21.916
I can't stop thinking
about the deposition

13:21.918 --> 13:24.636
and about my father.
Can I come down and talk?

13:24.638 --> 13:29.557
Not a great time.
I kind of have people over.

13:29.559 --> 13:32.227
Get in here.
What's wrong?

13:32.229 --> 13:33.795
I'm scared about tomorrow.

13:33.797 --> 13:34.979
I'm scared I'm gonna say
the wrong thing

13:34.981 --> 13:36.848
and make things worse
for my father.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.683
Look, all you have to do
is answer the questions

13:38.685 --> 13:41.736
as carefully as they suggested
and then throw in a wink,

13:41.738 --> 13:43.638
forget to wear panties.
He'll be fine.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.190
But that's the thing.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.308
The questions don't say
anything about my father.

13:47.310 --> 13:49.077
They're so cut and dry.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.195
They're only asking me
details about things

13:50.197 --> 13:52.080
I know nothing about,

13:52.082 --> 13:54.532
and they're not interested in
the things I do know about him.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.919
That he's warm, and funny,
and generous, and loving.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.504
Like when I was little,
and he and I

13:59.506 --> 14:01.506
would take our plane
to our chalet in deer valley.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.708
Stop. You might as well
rephrase that to

14:03.710 --> 14:05.376
"when he and I
would take our guilty

14:05.378 --> 14:07.512
to our guilty
in guilty valley."

14:07.514 --> 14:09.764
Every morning,
before we went skiing,

14:09.766 --> 14:11.349
he would get up
really early and make me

14:11.351 --> 14:13.301
his snowflake
cinnamon french toast.

14:13.303 --> 14:14.836
Sounds amazing.

14:14.838 --> 14:17.338
And as he dusted
the cinnamon and sugar on top,

14:17.340 --> 14:19.691
he'd say,
"look, sweetheart, it's snowing,

14:19.693 --> 14:21.860
snowing just for you."

14:21.862 --> 14:24.729
And then he'd cut it
into these little pieces...

14:24.731 --> 14:26.848
See? I can't even
get the words out.

14:26.850 --> 14:29.117
No one will ever hear them.
No one will know.

14:29.119 --> 14:32.353
I'll know.
I heard them.

14:33.739 --> 14:35.373
Another round?

14:35.375 --> 14:40.712
Yeah, I'm just gonna
bring my pillow in there.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.364
I don't think Gladiva's
gonna make it to the market.

14:48.785 --> 14:50.736
We'll be doing
the deposition in here.

14:50.738 --> 14:53.656
Oh, wow, this is exactly
how it looks on <i>Law & Order!</i>

14:53.658 --> 14:54.874
Ooh! Ooh!

14:54.876 --> 14:56.408
There's the tiny
typewriter thing

14:56.410 --> 14:58.127
where the actress
who never gets to speak sits!

14:58.129 --> 15:03.499
Leo, Leo, take my picture
near the tiny typewriter.

15:06.136 --> 15:09.088
Ladies, ladies.
We only have an hour.

15:09.090 --> 15:11.623
We're already behind
because you were late.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.809
Sorry, we had to stop
at the check-cashing place.

15:13.811 --> 15:18.931
Yeah, and then a store
to get diapers for a friend.

15:18.933 --> 15:21.350
There, $1,000.

15:21.352 --> 15:24.236
No fuss, and luckily, no muss.

15:24.238 --> 15:25.571
Max, do you have
the $100 from the cupcakes?

15:25.573 --> 15:26.636
Yeah.

15:26.637 --> 15:31.310
Uh, 40... 60...
80... 90...

15:31.312 --> 15:35.748
5, 6, 7, and...

15:35.750 --> 15:39.702
100.

15:41.454 --> 15:43.339
Mr. Hutchinson,
are you having reflux?

15:43.341 --> 15:48.711
No, I-it just became clear
to me what I do for a living.

15:48.713 --> 15:51.330
Okay, uh, Caroline,

15:51.332 --> 15:53.832
if you're ready,
I can bring them in.

15:53.834 --> 15:56.218
Remember,
just stick to the questions

15:56.220 --> 15:57.803
and don't embellish.

15:57.805 --> 16:00.856
I prepped her last night, Leo.

16:00.858 --> 16:02.224
All right, let's go, Max.

16:02.226 --> 16:04.109
Actually, I want her to stay.

16:04.111 --> 16:06.278
I'm nervous,
and she makes me feel better.

16:06.280 --> 16:10.015
Yes, I'm her registered
emotional companion.

16:10.017 --> 16:11.951
Well, this is
a legal proceeding,

16:11.953 --> 16:14.153
and that's
a highly unusual request.

16:14.155 --> 16:16.705
But not improbable.
We googled it.

16:16.707 --> 16:18.540
Yeah, she's allowed to have
an emotional companion,

16:18.542 --> 16:20.709
as long as
both attorneys agree.

16:20.711 --> 16:24.413
Well, I graduated
top of my class at Harvard,

16:24.415 --> 16:29.385
but since you googled it,
I'll try to make that happen.

16:29.387 --> 16:32.421
No, I am unaware
of any of the transactions

16:32.423 --> 16:33.505
you just mentioned.

16:33.507 --> 16:35.257
Thank you, miss Channing.

16:35.259 --> 16:37.676
Now, if you'll just bear with me
a little while longer,

16:37.678 --> 16:39.895
I only have a couple more
pertinent questions.

16:39.897 --> 16:44.483
Your voice is unbelievable.

16:46.052 --> 16:49.655
You could be on <i>Law & Order.</i>

16:49.657 --> 16:51.390
Max!

16:53.828 --> 16:56.278
Withdrawn.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.415
Miss Channing,
do you have any knowledge

16:59.417 --> 17:01.083
of embezzlement
of any kind taking place

17:01.085 --> 17:02.734
at the Channing
investment group?

17:02.736 --> 17:05.454
No, I had no knowl...

17:05.455 --> 17:09.290
Of any su...

17:10.294 --> 17:11.794
Could you repeat that?

17:16.267 --> 17:18.934
Ruh-roh.

17:18.935 --> 17:20.269
You're having a side effect!

17:20.271 --> 17:21.936
Tongue swelling.
TS!

17:21.939 --> 17:24.640
Uh, counselor,
give us one second.

17:24.642 --> 17:25.773
What is going on?

17:25.776 --> 17:28.777
We took drugs.

17:28.779 --> 17:30.696
Did she just say
"we took drugs"?

17:30.698 --> 17:33.449
Very good, Leo.
You must play charades.

17:33.451 --> 17:35.951
Look, we did a drug trial
to get money for this.

17:35.953 --> 17:37.703
What's the holdup, counselor?

17:37.705 --> 17:39.321
Just give her some water.
I had this once.

17:39.323 --> 17:40.489
It goes away in an hour.

17:40.491 --> 17:42.207
You said you never had

17:42.209 --> 17:43.826
any side effects!

17:43.828 --> 17:46.378
Oh, please.
I died once.

17:46.380 --> 17:50.883
I just didn't want
to scare you.

17:50.885 --> 17:53.118
Miss Channing,
are you aware of any accounts

17:53.120 --> 17:56.004
opened under any names
other than your father's?

17:58.592 --> 17:59.675
Just drink the water.

17:59.677 --> 18:02.928
One sec.

18:05.483 --> 18:08.633
Uh, does anyone have
a napkin or a bib?

18:08.635 --> 18:11.987
$1,100, you gotta have a bib
around here somewhere.

18:11.989 --> 18:14.773
All right,
what's going on here?

18:14.775 --> 18:17.809
I was just, uh,
informed my client

18:17.811 --> 18:21.330
was part of a drug test
within the last 24 hours.

18:21.332 --> 18:25.617
Drug test, Leo?
That's a good one.

18:25.619 --> 18:27.753
Just another
rich girl on drugs.

18:27.755 --> 18:30.923
Get her into rehab,
and we'll have to reschedule.

18:30.925 --> 18:32.925
We'll have to do this
another time.

18:32.927 --> 18:34.042
No, no, no, no, no, no!

18:34.044 --> 18:36.111
No, no!
She's right!

18:36.113 --> 18:38.163
We don't have the money
to do this another time

18:38.165 --> 18:41.433
look, I can tell you right now,
she does not know anything.

18:41.435 --> 18:42.718
She doesn't know
about the money,

18:42.720 --> 18:44.136
she doesn't know
about transactions.

18:44.138 --> 18:46.188
She doesn't know
anything about anything.

18:46.190 --> 18:47.356
We are paid up
for three more minutes,

18:47.358 --> 18:49.191
and we are going to use them!

18:49.193 --> 18:52.728
She can't talk, but I know
what she would want to say.

18:52.730 --> 18:56.982
Ladies and gentlemen
of the... room,

18:56.984 --> 19:00.018
she would want you to know
who her father really is.

19:00.020 --> 19:01.570
He used to make her snow toast!

19:01.572 --> 19:04.957
And in her words,
he was funny, smart,

19:04.959 --> 19:09.161
and a generous lover.

19:12.532 --> 19:14.666
Generous <i>and</i> loving!

19:14.668 --> 19:17.136
Oh, sorry, yes, yes.
Generous and loving.

19:17.138 --> 19:21.673
Now, I don't know her father,
and I have never met him...

19:21.675 --> 19:23.392
And I would like you
to put that on the record,

19:23.394 --> 19:26.711
actress who's never
allowed to talk...

19:26.713 --> 19:29.565
But I do know her,
and she's an amazing person.

19:29.567 --> 19:31.216
And her father
raised her alone,

19:31.218 --> 19:34.386
so he must be
an amazing person too.

19:34.388 --> 19:36.721
Well...

19:36.723 --> 19:39.558
That accomplished nothing.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.778
Counselor, what do we do here?

19:42.780 --> 19:47.166
We take a short recess
until she can speak,

19:47.168 --> 19:49.868
and resume
the deposition, on me,

19:49.870 --> 19:54.573
because her father
<i>is</i> an amazing guy, and...

19:54.575 --> 19:58.844
That's what they would do
on <i>Law & Order.</i>

19:58.846 --> 20:00.762
Fine, we'll break for an hour.

20:00.764 --> 20:06.018
Seriously, you sound like
a superhero's boss.

20:09.222 --> 20:10.606
Max, you're the best.

20:10.608 --> 20:13.275
I know.
I did pretty good, right?

20:13.277 --> 20:15.511
I should've gone to law school.

20:15.513 --> 20:18.697
Or High School.

20:24.654 --> 20:27.489
Permission to enter
the judge's chambers?

20:27.491 --> 20:30.209
Permission granted.
Excuse the tubs of bleu cheese.

20:30.211 --> 20:31.710
They're being held as evidence

20:31.712 --> 20:33.445
in the case
against eating here.

20:33.447 --> 20:36.715
I wanted to thank you
for everything you did.

20:36.717 --> 20:38.634
And I know you were gonna
buy yourself a treat

20:38.636 --> 20:39.735
with the drug money...

20:39.737 --> 20:41.303
Yeah, like drugs.

20:41.305 --> 20:43.889
So I got you
a little something.

20:43.891 --> 20:46.225
It's the complete
<i>Law & Order</i> box set!

20:46.227 --> 20:48.093
No way!

20:48.095 --> 20:51.263
That's not a little something.
That's, like, $500.

20:51.265 --> 20:53.348
Or $30 on the subway.

20:53.350 --> 20:55.634
And the guy said
most of them are in english.

20:55.636 --> 20:57.736
Awesome!

20:57.738 --> 20:59.090
Freezer adjourned.
