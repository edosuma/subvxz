So can I get your number?

00:16.920 --> 00:18.240
I'll take you out somewhere.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.600
I've got a mate of mine,

00:21.680 --> 00:23.280
he's selling
a whole bunch of cranes.

00:23.360 --> 00:25.280
That's why you need to know
this Afghan bloke.

00:25.360 --> 00:26.960
(GUNSHOTS)
Ahh. Arrgh.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.560
Every single one of them
cranes is making money.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.840
In a year from now, we could be
running this entire city.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.320
THE AFGHAN: But the deal
can't go ahead

00:34.400 --> 00:36.040
until you sort your shit out

00:44.040 --> 00:45.320
You have to do it, brother.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.680
Alright, I'll do it.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.920
I woulda done it but
he had his kids with him.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
It's the code.

01:01.080 --> 01:02.240
Can't do a hit in front of kids.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.800
It's old-school Italians.
Mafia, mate.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.040
It's how it works.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.320
Hey, have you got

03:39.240 --> 03:40.680
I was just wondering

03:40.760 --> 03:42.040
make some calls and stuff.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.800

03:49.080 --> 03:51.320

There's some pricks

03:54.880 --> 03:56.040
Who?

03:57.240 --> 03:58.400
Different blokes.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.440
Thought maybe you could
make some calls.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.840
Sort something out.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.400
Calls to who?
Who, who do you want me to call?

04:05.480 --> 04:07.360
I don't know.
Some of your mates.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.640
Some of the old school
blokes.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.000
I'm rooted here, hey.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.000

04:16.160 --> 04:17.920
What kind of trouble?

04:19.480 --> 04:21.360
Look, if you can't
help me out, I'm dead.

04:22.640 --> 04:23.920
Make some calls or what?

04:26.760 --> 04:28.240
You better tell me
what happened.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.920
Hey, guys. Come on up.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.200

REPORTER: Shots were fired
at a luxury cruise boat

10:15.000 --> 10:17.680
as it docked at Rose Bay Wharf
last night.

10:17.760 --> 10:20.320
The all-night, all-day
New Years Eve cruise

10:20.400 --> 10:23.880
was reportedly attended by prominent
Sydney underworld figures.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.640
The gunshot victim

10:25.720 --> 10:27.760
is the head of the notorious
Sydney street gang,

10:27.840 --> 10:29.280
Brothers For Life.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.680
The bullet wound to his shoulder
is not considered life-threatening

10:32.760 --> 10:35.920
and he is reportedly in a stable
condition in hospital.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.360

the shooting as gang related.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.320
What? What are you...
You must be a workaholic.

11:35.400 --> 11:36.840
It's not even a real photo.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.480
It's a set-up for Instagram.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.800
Oh, what, with
underworld figures?

11:40.880 --> 11:42.240
You actually think
there's a chance

11:42.320 --> 11:44.080
I'd believe that
bullshit, Pas?

11:44.160 --> 11:45.640
What'd you think

I wanna know who it is.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.320
Yeah, but I don't know, brother.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.160
It coulda been one of
the Bankstown dickheads

12:16.240 --> 12:19.240
or maybe it was someone who
didn't get an invite to the party.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.160
It was a pretty sick party, eh?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.400
Could be that.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.480
My face was on TV, brother.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.960
I got cops asking me

12:33.720 --> 12:35.000
(CHOPPING LOUDLY)

12:35.080 --> 12:36.320
Yeah.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.840
Yeah, maybe tomorrow.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.320
Mate, I can't right now, brother,

12:41.400 --> 12:43.480
you know, like,
I've got the kids and stuff.

12:43.560 --> 12:44.800
Maybe tomorrow, huh?

12:44.880 --> 12:46.080
Come into the shop.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.600
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.440
Why don't we go somewhere cool,
you know?

12:49.520 --> 12:50.720
Like, um...

12:50.800 --> 12:52.400
Like, maybe like The Star.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.800
I'll meet ya there at 1:00.

12:53.880 --> 12:57.200
It's chill. We can hang out.
We'll sort all this shit out.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.600
It'll be all good, brother.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.440
Just, just relax.
I'll see ya tomorrow.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.400
(VOMITS)

13:10.480 --> 13:12.200
Bravo, dickhead. Bravo.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.880
Hey. What's goin' on, fellas?

13:37.960 --> 13:39.240
How's the shoulder?

13:39.320 --> 13:41.160
You know who it was, dont'cha?
Ah, no, no, I...

13:41.240 --> 13:42.640
Did you have something
to do with it?

13:42.720 --> 13:44.040
Nah, nah, I asked around.
No one knows nothing.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.280
You bullshitting me?
No, no, no.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.600
You're fuckin' bullshitting me.
Hey. Hey...

13:46.680 --> 13:48.320
How does anyone
even know we're there?

13:48.400 --> 13:49.560
(CROSS-TALKING)

13:49.640 --> 13:51.280
It's probably some gronk
having a crack at somebody else.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.360
How did they know?

13:52.440 --> 13:53.880
Someone told them we were
gonna be there, that's how.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.480
Hey, hey. What do you mean?
Huh? Was it you, brother?

13:55.560 --> 13:56.560
What?

13:56.640 --> 13:58.080
Hey? Did you tell someone
we were coming in?

13:58.160 --> 13:59.120
Hey, hey.
What do you mean, brother?

13:59.200 --> 14:00.480
Huh, that's bullshit.
I wanna know who did it.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.680
Would I do that?
I'll kill them all.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.560
I'll kill their wives.
I'll kill their kids.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.520
I swear to god
I'll cut their heads off

14:05.600 --> 14:07.280
and drink their fuckin' blood.
Relax. Relax.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.000
Do you hear what
I'm saying to you, brother?

14:09.080 --> 14:10.800
I get it.
Just relax, please.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.320
Listen. It's unlucky you got shot,

14:13.400 --> 14:15.920
but you didn't get hit in the head,
so you're lucky.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.440
You hear what I'm saying?

14:22.640 --> 14:23.800
You serious?

14:23.880 --> 14:25.080
After all that?

14:26.040 --> 14:27.520
You heard anything from Azzizi?

14:27.600 --> 14:28.800
Who?

14:28.880 --> 14:30.920
The one who did the hit on Antoun.
He's disappeared.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.280
What do you mean?

14:32.360 --> 14:34.320
He's not answering his phone.
His mates haven't seen him.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.160
He's probably visiting
his mum or something.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.120
He's not visiting his mum.
The cops might have him.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.440
Why would the cops have him?

14:39.520 --> 14:41.400
Because he didn't cover
his face properly, the dumb prick.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.280
There was a CCTV,
coulda seen his face.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.000
He just had a hoodie.
No mask, no nothing.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.200
Well, if we don't know where he is,

14:46.280 --> 14:47.520
what's the point
in freaking out about him?

14:47.600 --> 14:49.320
He's probably playing X-Box
or smoking bongs somewhere.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.920
You know what happens
to dogs, mate.

14:51.800 --> 14:52.880
You know what happens.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.480
Yeah, yeah. Hey, you need
to chill out, man.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.680
I've been moving this thing up.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.320
My mate Les is ready
with the cranes.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.600
The crane company.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.000
We pay cash, the money
comes back washed.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.200
It's all legit, it's ready to go.
We're in business, bro.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.800
Look. Come here, come here.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.800
Look at this. Look at this.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.040
Look, look.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.440
See what that is?

15:13.520 --> 15:15.160
That's company titles.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.880
You and me
are equal directors.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.160
Yeah.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.760
This guarantees us site
contracts for the cranes.

15:20.840 --> 15:23.040
We got five cranes
already up and working.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.960
Pretty soon we're going to be
doing shit with all the big shots

15:25.040 --> 15:26.520
in the construction industry.

15:26.600 --> 15:27.760
Like George Alex, maybe.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.320
He's got heaps
of jobs running.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.440
I got your back,
brother, yeah?

15:32.520 --> 15:34.840
We can't be sweating this
small bullshit no more.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.880
Seriously. We're gonna run
this city, yeah?

15:36.960 --> 15:38.280
You and me. Come on.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.600
Yeah?

15:41.680 --> 15:43.080
Where was Miranda Kerr?

15:43.160 --> 15:44.280
Hey?

15:44.360 --> 15:46.440
You said she was gonna be there
but she was never even there.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.440
Were you bullshitting?

15:48.520 --> 15:49.560
Nah, what do you mean?

15:49.640 --> 15:51.160
She was probably sick
or something.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.720
Who gives a shit
about Miranda Kerr?

15:52.800 --> 15:54.000
What are you talking about?

15:54.080 --> 15:55.360
I heard she's stuck up, anyway.

15:59.560 --> 16:00.760
LES: How's The Afghan?

16:00.840 --> 16:02.040
Yeah, mate, he's all good.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.840
I think he's a bit pissed off
about getting shot

16:04.920 --> 16:06.720
but he's still sweet on the deal.

16:06.800 --> 16:07.840
He's good for the cash?

16:07.920 --> 16:09.080
Yeah, mate. Hey listen,

16:09.160 --> 16:10.920
these guys have got
so much cash laying around

16:11.000 --> 16:12.440
they can't wait to spend it.

16:12.520 --> 16:13.840
What about you? You got your share?

16:13.920 --> 16:15.200
Yeah, 'course I do, dickhead.

16:15.280 --> 16:16.640
I'm headed to the lockbox right now.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.520
I just gotta stop off
and get my key.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.600
Shit.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.880
Hey.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.000
It's me. Can you open the door?

16:39.080 --> 16:40.640
The key won't work for some reason.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.480
It's probably because
I changed the locks.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.760
What?

16:43.840 --> 16:46.240
I changed the locks,
because you're moving out.

16:46.320 --> 16:47.720
What's that s'posed to mean?

16:47.800 --> 16:49.040
Open the bloody door.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.120
You think you can stay out for days,
on TV hanging out with criminals.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.480
Rooting sluts and come back here
like nothing's happened?

16:55.560 --> 16:56.920
Hey.
Guess what, dickhead?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.440
Hey, hey...
You don't live here anymore.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.760
Hey, I'm in business.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.680
I don't even know
who invited those blokes.

17:02.640 --> 17:03.760
Hey.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.600
Just go away.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.520
I'm sorry.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.680
We'll talk about it.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.400
Just, can you please get
me the key for my lockbox.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.520
It's in the bedside drawer.
Can you get it for me?

17:23.360 --> 17:24.600
Yeah, hang on.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.760
Is it a silver key?

17:30.840 --> 17:32.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:32.160 --> 17:34.080
I flushed it down the toilet.
Anything else?

17:34.960 --> 17:36.440
What? You did what?

17:36.520 --> 17:38.160
I flushed your key, like you.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.360
Flushed away like
a big fat piece of shit.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.040
What? You did... Let me in.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.840
Let me in this door,
you stupid bitch.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.880
Let me in. Hey! Let me in!

17:47.240 --> 17:48.600
(MESSAGE TONE CHIMES)

17:52.040 --> 17:53.200
Shit.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.320
Stupid bitch.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.360
Fuck.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.600
You can't pick locks
like these, mate.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.600
You need to order a replacement key
from the company.

18:35.680 --> 18:36.880
That's the only way.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.200
But I need it today.
Can't you just drill it out?

18:39.280 --> 18:41.920
Mate, she's got
a cobalt alloy hard plate

18:42.000 --> 18:43.960
with tungsten carbide chips
mixed in with it.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.880
Nah, that'll break
even a diamond tip bit.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.840
It's a bastard of a job
getting in there.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.320
Take me a few days.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.680
I don't have time for that.
I need it today. Right now.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.400
Well, mate, what do you
want me to say?

19:36.920 --> 19:38.320
(EXPLOSION)

19:51.320 --> 19:52.720
Shit!

20:34.080 --> 20:35.560
(PHONE RINGS)

20:39.200 --> 20:40.760
Dickhead, how's it hangin?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.120
Yeah, what do you want, wanker?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.720
I'm just checking in, man.
You got the cash?

20:43.800 --> 20:44.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm getting it.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.320
What do you mean
you're getting it?

20:46.400 --> 20:47.520
You said you already had it.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.080
Hey, hey. I'm getting it
sorted out, OK?

20:49.160 --> 20:50.320
Don't be a dickhead about it.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.800
Tomorrow's it, mate.
Otherwise the deal's off, yeah?

20:52.880 --> 20:54.120
Yeah, yeah.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.360
Dickhead.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.480
Hey, brother. It's me.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.280
Yeah, man. I got a whole lot
of concert tickets.

21:12.360 --> 21:14.160
Front row seats. You want 'em?

21:20.840 --> 21:22.920
Hey, is Sila here?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.760
Dad! Dad!

21:24.840 --> 21:26.040
SILA: I'm on the toilet.

21:30.840 --> 21:31.840
What's up, bro?

21:33.080 --> 21:34.600
I need to speak to Sila.

21:39.320 --> 21:40.560
What do you got, bro?

21:40.640 --> 21:42.040
It's the Bolivian, mate.

21:43.360 --> 21:44.680
100% pure.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.080
It's the pearl.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.560
Hey, hey, careful, careful.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.520
Ah. Shit, bro.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.800
Told ya.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.800
I got 50 bricks of this stuff.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.120
Selling all in one hit.
Not splitting it up.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.360
What, 50?

22:12.440 --> 22:14.000
Yeah, I came to you
'cause we're mates.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.120
Wait, how much?

22:16.200 --> 22:18.360
2.2 mil. Delivery's tonight.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.040
Hey, take it
or leave it, brother.

22:22.120 --> 22:23.320
No worries if you don't want it.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.080
I got plenty of other blokes
who'll take it off my hands.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.600
OK, bro.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.520
Hmm?
Alright, bro.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.960
We got this.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.040
Oh, yeah, baby.
Yeah.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.320
How is it, Tocco? How is it?

23:47.480 --> 23:48.800
(COUGHS)

23:48.880 --> 23:50.080
Oh, jesus!

23:50.160 --> 23:51.440
What the fuckin'...

23:53.800 --> 23:55.720
Tocco? Tocco.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.040
What's wrong?

23:59.440 --> 24:01.280
That stuff you sold me
is shit, mate.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.560
It's not even real coke.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.880
It's like powdered dog shit.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.360
It's the Bolivian, mate.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.280
It's totally different
to the Colombian stuff.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.600
It's like wine, mate.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.520
It tastes different
from different countries.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.000
Do you seriously expect me
to believe that bullshit?

24:13.080 --> 24:14.400
Well, hey, it's not bullshit.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.000
Hey, I swear to god, bro.
It's top quality gear.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.400
A lot of people would probably kill
to have that stuff, brother.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.240
I'm tellin' ya, you know?
You're lucky to have it.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.160
Well, you sell that to them
and get me my money back.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.960
Get over here right now, bro,

24:25.040 --> 24:27.360
and get me my cash
and take this shit back.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.720
Otherwise...
Sorry, mate, I can't hear.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.160
Do you understand me?

24:31.240 --> 24:32.640
I can't hear, it's breaking up.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.760
Can you hear?

You got the cash?

25:03.720 --> 25:04.960
'Course I got it.
That's it.

25:06.440 --> 25:07.880
Ready?
Yeah, let's go.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.320
What's happening, fellas.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.120
Huh?

25:14.200 --> 25:15.280
Come here.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.560
Come here.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.080
Huh?

Nah, mate. It's shit.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.120
Why, what happened?

25:30.080 --> 25:31.600
Still haven't heard from Azzizi.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.000
Do you know where he is?

25:33.080 --> 25:34.280
No, where is he?

25:34.360 --> 25:36.040
Didn't he tell you?
Tell me what?

25:36.120 --> 25:37.320
Azzizi's missing.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.520
No one's seen him for ages.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.680
What does that mean?

25:40.760 --> 25:42.400
Means he's probably dead
or the cops got him.

25:42.480 --> 25:43.560
Either way, it's shit.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.800
Why didn't you tell me about this?

25:45.880 --> 25:47.320
There's nothin' to tell.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.440
Look, no one's seen him.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.480
There's nothin' we can do
about it, right?

25:51.560 --> 25:52.840
What's the point in worrying?

25:52.920 --> 25:54.520
What, we're gonna sit around
shitting our pants?

25:55.440 --> 25:56.720
He's probably gonna turn up

25:56.800 --> 25:58.240

we'll sort it out.

A shaved head and tattoo
were nothing to be proud of there.

36:02.560 --> 36:03.800
Ah, nah man.
Don't worry about it.

36:03.880 --> 36:04.920
I'll get a cab.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.240
Nah, nah, nah.
It's all good. I'll drive you.

36:06.320 --> 36:07.560
I'm heading that way.
Don't worry about it.

36:07.640 --> 36:08.840
Nah, nah. I'm heading that way.
I'll get a cab.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.560
Brother, it's easy.
I'm heading that way anyway.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.960
I'll drive you.
I'll put your bags in the car.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.240
Yeah, alright.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.080
Don't worry.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.760
Hey, how long you gone for?

36:19.840 --> 36:21.320
Couple of days.

36:21.400 --> 36:22.840
Just call if you've got any dramas.

36:23.560 --> 36:24.760
Yeah.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.360
All good?

36:37.440 --> 36:39.160
Yeah, it's good, yeah?
Yeah, cool, huh?

36:39.240 --> 36:40.480
I'll speak to ya. Thanks, huh?

36:40.560 --> 36:41.800
Yeah, bro.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.200
What are we gonna do?

37:18.280 --> 37:20.200
MAN: Alright, kids. You get ready
to swim to the other side.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.520
Dads, you ready? Let's go.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.760
Go, go, go. Win, win, win.

37:22.840 --> 37:23.920
Go, Gio.

37:24.920 --> 37:26.720
Go, buddy. Go. Go, go, go.

37:26.800 --> 37:28.000
Hey.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.040
Go, Gio. Good boy. Well done.

37:30.120 --> 37:32.080
Do the monkey walk, mate.
Go on.

37:32.160 --> 37:33.560
Keep walking back. That's it.

37:33.640 --> 37:34.920
Hey. Pretty good, eh?

37:35.000 --> 37:36.120
Swim back to your dads.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.640
Hey, come here, come here.

37:37.720 --> 37:38.960
Hey, take some photos, would ya?

37:39.040 --> 37:40.240
Good boy. Yeah.

37:40.320 --> 37:41.680
Hold on, there you go. There you go.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.120
Kicking, kicking, kicking, arms out.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.600
Kicking, kicking. Get your arms out.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.160
Hey, why have you got my phone?

37:46.240 --> 37:47.720
Well, mine's out of juice.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.720
Come on, Gio,
look at Mummy. Smile.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.680
Kick, kick, kick. Kick. Kick.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.720
Look at my little guy.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.360
Hey, you gonna be a champion, yeah?
You're gonna be a champion.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.600
(PHONE BEEPS)

38:00.360 --> 38:02.280
Kick, kick, kick, kick. Come on.

38:06.080 --> 38:07.320
What?

38:07.400 --> 38:09.240
Gio, click yourself in.
Hurry up.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.760
Hey, would you wait a second?

38:10.840 --> 38:12.960
It was a joke photo.
It was bullshit, I swear to god.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.600
Stay away from me,
you lying cock-sucking prick.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.320
I hate you. Go and root your whore.
Just get away from me, you...

38:18.400 --> 38:20.240
Hey.
..lying, low life piece of shit.

38:20.320 --> 38:21.440
Hey, hey.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.280
I know you're angry,
but it's bullshit.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.480
Hey, you can't be serious,
over one joke photo.

38:26.560 --> 38:28.400
No, get away from me,
you dickhead.

38:28.480 --> 38:31.160
I never wanna see you again.

38:31.240 --> 38:32.960
Babe, I know you're angry... Hey.

38:33.040 --> 38:34.280
I know you're angry.

38:34.360 --> 38:36.080
When you calm down,
we're gonna sort this out.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.160
Hey.

38:39.160 --> 38:40.520
Hey, where you, where you goin'?

38:40.600 --> 38:41.840
What are you doing?

38:42.880 --> 38:44.000
Hey.

38:44.080 --> 38:46.040
Hey, what are you goin'?
You can't leave me here.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.520
Stupid bitch.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.080
Fuck.

38:55.185 --> 38:55.200
Good evening. I'm Michael Usher.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.680
REPORTER 1: A crucial piece
of evidence in a gangland murder,

38:58.760 --> 39:00.560
torched on the side of the road.

39:02.440 --> 39:06.080
REPORTER 2: Just after midnight,
three men, two handguns...

39:06.160 --> 39:08.160
An execution, police say,

39:08.240 --> 39:10.920
the criminal world self-destructs.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.920
(LAUGHING)

39:20.040 --> 39:22.960
Known hitman,
shot while police moved on.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.160
One victim is pronounced dead.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.880
His 12-year-old nephew
was just metres away.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.520
Police yet to find the gunman.

39:30.600 --> 39:31.760
Fuck.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.320
What do you want?

39:45.040 --> 39:46.280
Can I come in?

39:46.360 --> 39:47.520
I wanna say goodnight to the kids.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.240
They're asleep.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.200
Well, I need to get some
clothes and stuff.

39:52.280 --> 39:53.640
You can't just keep all my shit.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.680
(GUNSHOTS)

41:10.280 --> 41:12.200
Mate, I can't believe
nothin' hit ya.

41:12.280 --> 41:14.040
Completely missed me.
It's unbelievable.

41:14.120 --> 41:16.240
He must have been
a shithouse shot.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.120
Nah, I was just
too quick for him.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.000
Oh, what, you dodged
the bullets?

41:20.080 --> 41:21.720
Huh, like Superman
or something?

41:21.800 --> 41:22.960
Is that what you're saying?

41:23.040 --> 41:24.720
No, I'm saying I moved
at the right time.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.320
Please.

41:27.400 --> 41:28.760
Who put the contract out on you?

41:28.840 --> 41:30.000
No idea.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.120
Well, you could probably
work it out.

41:32.200 --> 41:34.600
Who have you pissed off so much
they want you dead?

41:34.680 --> 41:36.120
It could be anyone.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.520
No, can't be anyone.

41:37.600 --> 41:38.920
A hit's expensive.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.080
Someone's paid a lot of money
to have you knocked.

41:41.160 --> 41:43.320
Who's got the money
and hates you that much?

41:43.400 --> 41:45.040
I reckon I can narrow it down

41:45.120 --> 41:46.320
to maybe like...

41:50.640 --> 41:52.000
..eight different people.

41:52.080 --> 41:53.640
Eight?
Or nine.

41:53.720 --> 41:54.760
Nin...

41:54.840 --> 41:56.760
Nine different
people want you dead?

41:56.840 --> 41:58.120
How can it be that many?

41:58.200 --> 41:59.560
I've got enemies.

41:59.640 --> 42:01.840
If you're successful in business
it's normal to have enemies.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.240
It's not normal.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.920
Most people can be
successful in business

42:05.000 --> 42:06.800
without having people
paying money to kill them.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.440
You got nine separate people
trying to kill ya.

42:09.520 --> 42:11.160
I would say that's not normal, mate.

42:11.240 --> 42:15.080
Why do you always have to be
such a dick about everything?

42:15.160 --> 42:16.360
Are you alright?

42:16.440 --> 42:18.720
Seriously, did I drop you
on your head as a baby or what?

42:18.800 --> 42:20.200
What's the matter with you?

42:23.160 --> 42:25.000
Listen, if you wanna get
this thing sorted out,

42:25.080 --> 42:27.080
we've gotta work out
who put the hit on you, alright?

42:27.160 --> 42:28.320
Does that make sense?

42:29.360 --> 42:30.560
Yeah.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.440
Well, let's look at this list.
Who's first?

42:32.520 --> 42:33.800
The Afghan.

42:52.600 --> 42:53.800
It's me.

42:53.880 --> 42:55.400
Hey, what's goin' on, mate?

42:56.280 --> 42:57.440
Where you callin' from?

42:57.520 --> 42:59.880
Where do you think?
I'm in Long Bay.

42:59.960 --> 43:01.600
Oh, yeah? How's it in there?

43:01.680 --> 43:03.600
You all good?
Nah, it's shit.

43:03.680 --> 43:06.120
Hey, baby. Can you go
get me some tampons?

43:07.040 --> 43:08.480
I can't go out like this. Please?

43:08.560 --> 43:09.800
One second. I'm on the phone. Shh.

43:10.440 --> 43:11.560
Sorry, mate.

43:11.640 --> 43:12.880
I wanna know where my money is.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.400
The 2 million cash I gave you.

43:14.480 --> 43:16.760
Yeah, hey brother,
the crane thing's up and running.

43:16.840 --> 43:17.800
It's all sweet.

43:17.880 --> 43:19.120
It's all waiting for you
when you get out.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.000
It's all good, mate.
I'm suss, mate.

43:21.080 --> 43:22.480
I'm very suss on you.

43:22.560 --> 43:24.080
Hey, what are you
talking about, suss?

43:24.160 --> 43:25.240
What are you talking about?

43:25.320 --> 43:27.040
I hand you a pile of cash
then I get busted.

43:28.320 --> 43:29.480
It's suss.

43:29.560 --> 43:30.600
Come on, brother.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.440
You really think I had something
to do with you getting busted?

43:32.520 --> 43:33.600
Did you?

43:34.400 --> 43:35.880
No.
Did you?

43:35.960 --> 43:37.240
No, no way.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.680
So why would he think that then?

43:38.760 --> 43:40.000
He's paranoid.

43:40.080 --> 43:42.120
He is a very paranoid dude.

43:42.200 --> 43:43.920
Oh, what, so just because
he's paranoid,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.320
that means he hasn't got a proper
reason to put a hit out on ya?

43:46.400 --> 43:47.600
Is that what you're tellin' me?

43:49.000 --> 43:50.320
What about the Antoun murder?

43:50.400 --> 43:52.120
I already told ya.
I'm serious, mate.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.600
I don't know nothing about that.

43:53.680 --> 43:55.800
I never even heard
of this Azzizi.

43:57.560 --> 43:58.880
We never said his name.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.240
What?

44:00.320 --> 44:01.760
You just said Azzizi.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.120
We never told you his name.

44:03.200 --> 44:04.520
Nah, nah, bullshit.

44:04.600 --> 44:05.840
I heard you say it.

44:05.920 --> 44:07.160
You said it before.

44:08.960 --> 44:10.280
Should we check the tape?

44:12.920 --> 44:14.760
You just incriminated
yourself, Pat.

44:14.840 --> 44:17.600
You are going down so hard
it's not even funny.

44:17.680 --> 44:19.200
What do you wanna do?

44:28.520 --> 44:29.800
What do you want me to do?

44:29.880 --> 44:31.880
We want you to start
talking right now.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.120
You're kidding me.

44:33.840 --> 44:35.280
Azzizi was caught anyway.

44:35.360 --> 44:36.600
They were goin' down.

44:36.680 --> 44:38.160
But you confirmed it.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.160
Who gives a shit if I confirm
something they already knew?

44:40.240 --> 44:42.000
A lot of people.
A lot of people give a shit.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.280
What's the matter with you?

44:45.440 --> 44:47.280
So now the Afghan
wants you dead, 100%.

44:47.360 --> 44:48.480
How would they even know?

44:48.560 --> 44:50.040
How would they even
find out about it?

44:50.120 --> 44:51.760
What, you think the coppers
kept their mouths shut?

44:51.840 --> 44:53.560
You'd trust those blokes
with your life, would ya?

44:53.640 --> 44:55.160
What's the matter with you?

45:01.480 --> 45:03.000
What about the Tongans?

45:06.280 --> 45:09.680
We just located these in a cavity
underneath the refrigerator.

45:09.760 --> 45:11.400
Do you know what's inside them?

45:12.040 --> 45:13.240
Nah.

45:13.320 --> 45:14.600
Do they belong to you?

45:14.680 --> 45:15.920
Never seen 'em before.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
So we're not going to find
any of your fingerprints on them?

45:19.080 --> 45:21.160
Or your DNA?
Is that what you're telling me?

45:21.240 --> 45:22.640
How much jail they get?

45:22.720 --> 45:26.600
There wasn't all that much
actual coke in those bricks.

45:27.320 --> 45:28.480
What does that mean?

45:28.560 --> 45:29.640
It means it was cut so much

45:29.720 --> 45:31.160
that they got downgraded
to possession.

45:31.240 --> 45:32.400
They got bail.

45:32.480 --> 45:34.080
They're out?
Yeah.

45:35.120 --> 45:36.200
Shit.

45:37.480 --> 45:39.920
Well, oh, mate, you can definitely
add them to the list.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.840
And I can't say
I blame them, either.

45:41.920 --> 45:43.760
What is that
s'posed to mean?

45:43.840 --> 45:46.480
It means if you screw someone over
that badly in the crim world,

45:46.560 --> 45:47.800
you get killed.

45:47.880 --> 45:51.240
Is that such a difficult concept
for you to understand?

45:51.320 --> 45:53.480
It's a dog eat dog
world out there.

45:57.320 --> 45:58.600
Who else is there?

46:00.200 --> 46:01.680
There's the Melinda thing.

46:01.760 --> 46:03.360
Mel... Your wife Melinda?

46:03.440 --> 46:04.560
Yeah.

46:04.640 --> 46:06.520
I keep her in the dark
and that but...

46:08.440 --> 46:09.600
Maybe.

46:12.080 --> 46:13.440
Come here, baby girl.

46:13.520 --> 46:14.640
Ooh.

46:21.160 --> 46:22.280
Daddy.

46:22.360 --> 46:23.680
Babba, I missed you so much.

46:23.760 --> 46:24.920
What are you doing here?

46:25.000 --> 46:26.760
What do you think?
Trying to see my daughter.

46:26.840 --> 46:27.960
Where have you been?

46:28.040 --> 46:29.480
I've been around.
I've been around.

46:29.560 --> 46:30.640
How have you been, eh?

46:30.720 --> 46:32.240
She's gotta go to school, Pas.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

46:32.320 --> 46:33.720
Hey, wait, wait.
Hey, come here.

46:33.800 --> 46:35.120
You miss me or what?
Yes.

46:36.360 --> 46:37.560
Hey, you miss Daddy?

46:37.640 --> 46:39.680
I missed you. You know that, right?

46:39.760 --> 46:40.960
Have a good day, OK?

46:41.040 --> 46:42.080
Be good.

46:42.160 --> 46:43.600
I missed you. Gimme a hug,
gimme a hug, gimme a hug.

46:43.680 --> 46:44.720
Come here.

46:44.800 --> 46:45.880
Hello, Mrs Kimble. How are you?

46:45.960 --> 46:47.000

46:47.080 --> 46:48.760
Hey. How's Maria doing?
She been a good girl?

46:48.840 --> 46:50.000
Ah, yes. Much better.

46:50.080 --> 46:51.840
Hey, guys. How are youse?
How's the little one?

46:51.920 --> 46:53.120

46:53.200 --> 46:55.360
Great. That's really good.
Nice to see youse.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.600

46:56.680 --> 46:59.240
OK, I gotta go too.
Nice to see you all. Bye.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.000
Bye, Maria.

47:03.760 --> 47:05.080
Hey, hey. Just wait a second.

47:05.160 --> 47:06.440
Hey.

47:06.520 --> 47:07.600

47:07.680 --> 47:09.360
Will you just
wait a second, please?

47:09.440 --> 47:10.920
Hey. Hey.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.200
I'm not even talking to you.

47:12.280 --> 47:13.680
Ah, yes you fuckin' are. Hey.

47:13.760 --> 47:16.280
Hey, stop.
You are a useless prick.

47:16.360 --> 47:18.080
You don't even pay to
support your own kids.

47:18.160 --> 47:19.920
They're my kids. If I wanna
see my kids I'll see my kids.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.600
Yeah, but they live with me,
they don't live with you.

47:21.680 --> 47:23.320
So piss off.
Let go of the door.

47:23.400 --> 47:24.640
Let go. Pas, let...

Argh.

47:36.960 --> 47:39.000
Hey. Don't you walk away from me.

47:39.080 --> 47:40.160
Get away from me.

47:40.240 --> 47:41.520

you stupid bitch.

47:41.600 --> 47:42.760
Come here. Hey.

Hey. Hey.

47:45.080 --> 47:46.200
Let go of me, ya dickhead.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.280
Hey, I wanna see my kids,
I'll see my kids whenever I want.

47:48.360 --> 47:49.920
You don't answer the phone,
you don't answer the door...

47:50.000 --> 47:51.320
You're the one out there
rooting skanks

47:51.400 --> 47:52.920
and you won't even
take care of your own kids.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.200
You think you can come here
and tell me what to do?

47:55.280 --> 47:57.560
How would you like a smack
in the face, you stupid bitch?

47:57.640 --> 47:59.720
Would that make you feel
like a real man, would it?

47:59.800 --> 48:00.920
Hitting girls?

48:01.000 --> 48:02.680
Well you may as well 'cause
you can't handle yourself

48:02.760 --> 48:04.640
against anyone
who could actually fight.

48:04.720 --> 48:07.840
You think you're such
a big man, but you're a joke.

48:07.920 --> 48:10.320
All your friends laugh
at you behind your back.

48:10.400 --> 48:13.760
All your family hates you
and you're a shithouse father.

48:13.840 --> 48:17.080
Your own kids are gonna
end up hating you.

48:22.360 --> 48:24.320
Huh? Huh? Huh?
What the fuck are you doing?

48:24.400 --> 48:26.600
You think you can do
what you want, huh? Huh? Huh?

48:26.680 --> 48:28.520
When you met me,
you had nothing.

48:28.600 --> 48:29.840
Don't forget that.

48:29.920 --> 48:31.600
Everything you have, I gave you.

48:31.680 --> 48:33.240
Do you understand me?

48:33.320 --> 48:35.240
You think you can go around
doin' what you want?

48:35.320 --> 48:37.040
I'll break your fuckin' neck
with my own hands.

48:37.120 --> 48:39.160
You understand me?
I'll fuckin' kill you.

48:41.440 --> 48:42.760

49:38.640 --> 49:40.560
Melinda's not gonna
put a hit out on you.

49:40.640 --> 49:41.960
She's not even a crim.

49:42.040 --> 49:45.680
Nah, nah, I'm not saying that
she tried to kill me, but...

49:47.280 --> 49:48.760
I wouldn't blame her if she did.

49:51.040 --> 49:52.480
I spat in her face, Dad.

49:56.520 --> 49:58.000
She made me so mad, you know.

49:59.440 --> 50:00.760
She took the kids.

50:00.840 --> 50:04.640

and like I just, I lost it.

50:09.920 --> 50:11.960
She made me so
goddamn mad, but...

Get out of my way.

The whole world knew you snitched.

52:04.760 --> 52:07.480
Your mate Barbaro is being
protected by the Crime Commission.

52:07.560 --> 52:08.960
It looks like quite a few blokes

52:09.040 --> 52:11.280
are doing major prison time
because of him.

52:11.360 --> 52:13.800
Supposed to have dogged on someone
to get off an assault charge.

52:13.880 --> 52:15.640
He's a dog.

52:15.720 --> 52:17.000
You think he dogged on me?

52:18.640 --> 52:20.080
Fuckin' wog prick.

52:20.160 --> 52:22.160
There's so much bullshit
flying around at the moment.

52:22.240 --> 52:24.120
Everyone's hysterical.
You don't know what to believe.

52:24.200 --> 52:26.200
He dogged on you and the Afghans.

52:26.280 --> 52:27.960
You're lucky you got out
when you did.

52:28.040 --> 52:29.440
Yeah, alright, he's a dickhead, OK?

52:29.520 --> 52:31.080
But I just didn't think that

52:31.160 --> 52:32.800
he'd dog on his close mates,
that's all.

52:32.880 --> 52:34.120
Let me get this straight.

52:34.760 --> 52:39.000
All your friends are either in jail,
dead or on the run because of you.

52:39.080 --> 52:41.240
Every crim in Sydney wants you dead.

52:41.320 --> 52:43.360

to have you knocked.

52:43.440 --> 52:45.960
When your court case comes up,
you're facing a long stretch.

52:46.040 --> 52:48.520
Your wife hates ya
and you can't see your kids.

52:49.480 --> 52:50.680
Am I missing anything here?

52:59.240 --> 53:03.000
Hey, Dad. Do you remember that time
when Uncle Pat came and got me?

53:03.960 --> 53:05.120
When I was a kid?

53:06.640 --> 53:07.760
Yeah.

53:07.840 --> 53:09.000
I was nine.

53:09.080 --> 53:10.680
He come grabbed me off the street.

53:10.760 --> 53:12.640
Drove me form Brissie to Melbourne.

53:13.400 --> 53:15.080
Took us three days.

53:15.160 --> 53:16.680
Drags me to Pentridge Prison

53:16.760 --> 53:18.520
and I meet my Dad
for the first time.

53:19.760 --> 53:21.280
Yeah, what about it?

53:21.360 --> 53:22.680
It was fucked up.

53:24.280 --> 53:26.000
Don't even know
I had a Dad before that.

53:26.080 --> 53:27.760
Yeah, well that was
your mum's fault.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.040
She's the one who took you away.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.320
Yeah.

53:30.400 --> 53:31.920
But she did it to protect me.

53:32.760 --> 53:34.480
She wanted to keep me away
from all this shit.

53:35.440 --> 53:37.080
What's the point
you're trying to make here?

53:37.160 --> 53:39.760
What if you left me
in Brissie, hmm?

53:39.840 --> 53:41.120
You never sent him to come get me,

53:41.200 --> 53:42.720
I would have done
something good with my life.

53:42.800 --> 53:44.240
Something different
to all this shit.

53:45.480 --> 53:46.920
100%, you know what I mean?

53:48.160 --> 53:49.480
No, I don't know what you mean.

53:49.560 --> 53:50.760
What do you mean?

53:50.840 --> 53:52.400
What, you wish you never met me?

53:52.480 --> 53:54.840
Nah, nah, nah.
I'm not saying that.

53:56.680 --> 53:58.600
But I'm this position
because of you.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.360
(CHUCKLES)

54:05.800 --> 54:07.160
Fuck you, mate.

54:09.480 --> 54:10.960
I'm your father.

54:11.640 --> 54:15.480
I'm your father, I got every right
to want my son in my life.

54:15.560 --> 54:18.960
If you're trying to blame me
for your own fuck ups,

54:19.040 --> 54:21.120
then that's a bit bloody rich.

54:25.800 --> 54:27.480
What if you just
left there, huh?

54:30.080 --> 54:31.280
You ever think about that?

54:31.360 --> 54:32.520
No.

54:33.640 --> 54:35.280
Because there's no bloody point.

54:35.360 --> 54:37.160
You are who you are, mate.

54:37.240 --> 54:38.480
If I'd have left you in Brisbane,

54:38.560 --> 54:40.840
you'd have blokes in Brisbane
trying to kill you right now.

54:42.040 --> 54:44.160
Don't try and pin
your bullshit on me, mate.

55:00.200 --> 55:02.040
Mate, this isn't helping. Come on.

55:03.920 --> 55:05.760
We gotta work it out, mate.
Let's try and...

55:05.840 --> 55:08.560
We gotta try and get you
out of this shit somehow.

55:08.640 --> 55:09.960
Can you make some calls, then?

55:10.040 --> 55:11.640
Call some of
the old school blokes.

55:11.720 --> 55:13.080
Oh, mate, that's gonna be tricky.

55:13.160 --> 55:14.680
Why?
Why?

55:14.760 --> 55:16.400
Why do you think why?

55:17.480 --> 55:18.760
What, those old gronks still...

55:19.600 --> 55:21.480
Those old gronks still
got the shits with me?

55:21.560 --> 55:23.000
What do you want me
to tell you, mate?

55:23.920 --> 55:25.240
They hold a grudge.

55:32.760 --> 55:34.480
I'll do what I can,
but in the meantime,

55:34.560 --> 55:36.040
you gotta get yourself
out of town.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.800
Where am I s'posed to go?
I don't know.

55:38.880 --> 55:40.200
Drive up the coast somewhere.

55:40.280 --> 55:41.560
Stay in motels.

55:41.640 --> 55:42.800
Pay cash for everything.

55:42.880 --> 55:44.280
Don't use your credit cards
for nothing.

55:44.360 --> 55:45.480
Yeah, yeah.

55:46.400 --> 55:47.640
Just treat it like a holiday.

55:47.720 --> 55:49.400
You probably need a bit
of a break anyway.

55:50.720 --> 55:52.040
Got your burner phones?

55:52.120 --> 55:53.200
Yeah.

55:53.280 --> 55:54.560
Well, call me when you get settled.

55:55.400 --> 55:56.920
Ciao.
Ciao.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.320
Oh, keep your head down, alright?

55:59.400 --> 56:00.920
Don't draw attention to yourself.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.320
Yeah. OK, Dad.

56:02.400 --> 56:03.520
No worries.

56:03.600 --> 56:04.720
You'll be right.

56:09.560 --> 56:10.880
Is that your car?

56:10.960 --> 56:12.240
Yeah, mate.

56:12.320 --> 56:13.600
How fast does it go?

56:14.440 --> 56:15.560
Fast.

56:15.640 --> 56:16.680
Ooh.

56:16.760 --> 56:17.880
Shit.

56:21.160 --> 56:22.320
Ooh.

57:21.200 --> 57:22.880
Hey, baby. Check this out.

57:22.960 --> 57:25.280
2,000 likes. Don't you think
that's so cool?

57:26.000 --> 57:27.200
I have shit to do.

57:28.400 --> 57:29.920
What are you doing?

57:30.000 --> 57:31.840
I'm packing.
What does it look like?

57:31.920 --> 57:33.240
Yeah, I can see that. Why?

57:33.320 --> 57:34.440
What, are you going somewhere?

57:34.520 --> 57:35.680
Yeah.

57:35.760 --> 57:38.000
If you won't fuckin' talk to me
I'm gonna go insane.

57:38.080 --> 57:40.360
What is wrong with you that
you won't even talk to me, huh?

57:40.440 --> 57:42.240
What, do you hate me?
Is that it?

57:42.320 --> 57:44.000
Well, I hate you too,
you stupid pig.

57:44.080 --> 57:45.640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hang on a second, would ya?

57:45.720 --> 57:46.960
Would ya chill out.

57:47.040 --> 57:48.200
I got people trying to kill me.

57:48.280 --> 57:50.040
I gotta lay low for a while.
Gotta get out of town.

57:50.120 --> 57:51.280
Jesus Christ.

57:53.760 --> 57:55.200
Crazy.
Where are you going?

57:55.280 --> 57:57.000
I don't know.
A motel or something.

57:57.080 --> 57:59.000
Look, it's better
if you don't know where. Just...

57:59.080 --> 58:00.320
Why can't we go together?

58:00.400 --> 58:02.320
Because I don't want to put
you in danger, you know?

58:02.400 --> 58:03.880
Hey, trust me.
You don't want this life.

58:03.960 --> 58:05.080
I don't care.

58:05.160 --> 58:06.400
I think we should just be together.

58:06.480 --> 58:08.080
And besides, I know
the perfect place.

58:08.160 --> 58:09.360
My mum's house.

58:09.440 --> 58:11.120

Well, I'm trying
to help you out here.

1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:51.160
I'm trying to do my best, alright?

1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:53.120
How are you trying?
You haven't done anything.

1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:54.440
There's only so much I can do.

1:15:54.520 --> 1:15:55.600
'Cause this is a Sydney thing,

1:15:55.680 --> 1:15:57.560
you need to connect with
some of your Sydney mates.

1:15:57.640 --> 1:15:58.840
What do you mean?

1:15:58.920 --> 1:16:01.400
It means you made yourself
vulnerable by being a lone wolf.

1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:04.480
You need powerful friends around you
right now to protect ya.

1:16:05.560 --> 1:16:06.760
Like who?

1:16:06.840 --> 1:16:09.080
Like who? Like the big blokes.

1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:10.520
What about your crane mates?

1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:12.000
What are you even talking about?

1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:14.600
You got yourself a crane business
worth millions of dollars.

1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:16.080
You're in the construction game.

1:16:16.160 --> 1:16:18.000
What, you don't know any
of the big blokes?

1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:20.480
Surely you know some of
the big blokes up there.

1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:22.760
I know George.

1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:25.080
George Alex.
Who's that?

1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:28.240
He's in like construction.
He's running it all over the city.

1:16:28.320 --> 1:16:31.600
Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly the kind
of bloke you need to connect with.

1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:32.960
Why don't you go see him

1:16:33.040 --> 1:16:34.480
and ask him to make
some calls for ya?

1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:35.720
Yeah.

1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:37.440
I guess I could go see George.

1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:39.760
He's a smart guy.

1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:41.480
He hears things.

1:16:41.560 --> 1:16:43.640
Maybe he can ask around.
That's exactly right.

1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:46.040
And then if you can find out
who put the hit out on ya,

1:16:46.120 --> 1:16:48.040
then you can find a way
to make amends.

1:16:48.120 --> 1:16:49.360
Like what?

1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:51.600
Pay him some cash.
Smooth things over.

1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:52.800
Give him something.

1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:54.440
I don't know,
a piece of your crane business.

1:16:54.520 --> 1:16:55.680
My cranes?

1:16:55.760 --> 1:16:57.480
Or what, you'd rather
lose it all, mate?

1:16:57.560 --> 1:16:59.000
Yeah, yeah.

1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:00.600
No worries.

1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:01.880
That actually might work.

1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:03.120
There ya go.

1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:05.720
Alright, call me.
Let me know how you go.

1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:07.200
OK, Dad.

1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:08.840
You'll be alright.

1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:10.200
Bye.
Ciao.

1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:12.160
What'd he say?

1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:13.800
Might have found a way
to sort this out.

1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:15.400
Oh, are you serious?
Yeah.

1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:17.160
You know that cash I gave ya?
I need it back.

1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:18.760
Yeah. What?
Yeah.

1:17:18.840 --> 1:17:20.400
I'm gonna have to pay
some blokes off.

1:17:20.480 --> 1:17:21.680
I need the cash back.

1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:23.040
You're joking, right?

1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:24.360
Nah, it might save my life.

1:17:24.440 --> 1:17:25.600
Is that right?

1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:27.680
Why're you being so selfish?

1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:28.960
Me being selfish?

1:17:29.040 --> 1:17:30.440
You get a root and think

1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:32.360
you can go straight back
to your same old bullshit.

1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:33.520
What do you mean?

1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:35.320
I just found a way I might be able
to pay to save my life,

1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:36.520
you don't give a shit?

1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:37.720
Can I just remind you,

1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:40.160
you kicked the shit out of me
and spat in my face?

1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:42.880
You don't pay a cent
in child support,

1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:44.960
but you shower your
slut girlfriend with presents.

1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:46.640
And then you finally
do the right thing

1:17:46.720 --> 1:17:48.520
but you get one phone call
and suddenly you want a refund.

1:17:48.600 --> 1:17:50.120
Guess what, dickhead?
It doesn't work like that.

1:17:50.200 --> 1:17:51.760
Listen, you stupid bitch.

1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:54.880
Shit.

1:17:58.320 --> 1:17:59.480
You're right.

1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:02.320
I owed you that money.

1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:04.400
It's yours.

1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:08.080
No point in cracking
the shits about it now.

1:18:12.600 --> 1:18:14.200
I meant every word I said.

1:18:40.320 --> 1:18:42.120
Hey, George. It's Pasquale here.

1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:44.240
I just needed to talk to you
about, just um...

1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:46.760
Listen, can you just
give me a call back

1:18:46.840 --> 1:18:48.160
soon as you get this message, yeah?

1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:50.200
Cheers. Bye.

1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:25.560
(INTERCOM BUZZER)

1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:27.920
MAN: Yeah?

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:29.200
Hey, is George here?

1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:30.440
Nah.

1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:31.800
Where is he?

1:19:31.880 --> 1:19:33.800
Dunno, who are you?

1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:36.000
I'm just a mate of his.

1:19:36.080 --> 1:19:37.400
Are you sure he's not here?

1:19:38.120 --> 1:19:39.280
Nah, he's not here.

1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:48.280
(PHONE RINGS)

1:19:54.400 --> 1:19:55.680
Hey.

1:19:55.760 --> 1:19:57.880
Hey, baby. How are you?

1:19:57.960 --> 1:19:59.960
Yeah, I'm fine. All good.

1:20:00.040 --> 1:20:01.480
I've been worried about you.

1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:03.400
Where've you been?

1:20:04.040 --> 1:20:05.160
Just sorting shit out.

1:20:05.240 --> 1:20:06.400
Is it gonna be OK?

1:20:06.480 --> 1:20:07.760
(PHONE BEEPS)

1:20:07.840 --> 1:20:09.240

(HANGS UP)

1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:12.000
Hello?

1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:13.440
Hey there, Pas. It's George.

1:20:14.640 --> 1:20:16.200
Hey, mate. How's it going?

1:20:16.280 --> 1:20:17.440
Good, good.

1:20:17.520 --> 1:20:18.920
Sorry not to call you earlier, mate.

1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:20.280
I've been stuck in meetings all day.

1:20:21.120 --> 1:20:23.040
Nah, nah, nah.
Hey, no worries mate.

1:20:23.120 --> 1:20:24.440
Thanks for calling me back.

1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:26.720
Hey, can I talk to you
about something?

1:20:27.640 --> 1:20:29.440
Oh, yeah. What is it?

1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:32.880
I don't wanna say too much
over the phone, you know,

1:20:32.960 --> 1:20:36.520
but just about some of
the problems that I had going on.

1:20:36.600 --> 1:20:39.080
You know, certain problems
with certain blokes.

1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:43.160
Um, I'm heading up to
my mum's place in Earlwood.

1:20:43.240 --> 1:20:44.400
She's getting quiet old

1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:46.400
and I've gotta go over there
and cook for her, you know?

1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:47.440
Do you wanna meet me there?

1:20:47.520 --> 1:20:49.200
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good.

1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:50.400
OK, great.

1:20:51.080 --> 1:20:52.400
We can catch up, have a chat.

1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:54.480
I'll text you the address.

1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:56.240
Awesome, mate. Awesome.

1:20:56.320 --> 1:20:58.560
Hey, thanks a lot, George.
I'll see you soon.

1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:46.720
Hey, George.
Hey.

1:21:48.360 --> 1:21:49.600
Come in, mate.

1:21:56.520 --> 1:21:57.680
Mum.

1:21:57.760 --> 1:21:58.880
Mum.

1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:00.520
This is Pasquale.

1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:02.560
Ciao, Mrs Alex.

1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:03.840
Nice to meet you.

1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:05.160
Say, Mum?

1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:06.520
Come through, mate.

1:22:07.440 --> 1:22:09.360
She's old now,
but she's stubborn.

1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:11.280
There's no way she's going
to go into a nursing home.

1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:12.360
Yeah.

1:22:12.440 --> 1:22:13.720
I wouldn't want that
for her, anyway.

1:22:13.800 --> 1:22:14.880
Yeah, yeah, totally.

1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:16.560
You know, she looked after me,
you know,

1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:18.000
so it's only fair
I look after her now.

1:22:18.080 --> 1:22:19.240
Yeah, yeah, totally.

1:22:19.320 --> 1:22:20.800
Hey, so I just wanted to...

1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:22.400
You know how to make moussaka?

1:22:22.480 --> 1:22:24.240
I've never even eaten it.

1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:25.560
You've never had moussaka?

1:22:25.640 --> 1:22:27.120
Mate, you're in for a treat.

1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:28.840
I make the best moussaka
in Australia.

1:22:29.960 --> 1:22:32.680
People like to fry the eggplant,
but I reckon it makes it too soggy.

1:22:32.760 --> 1:22:34.080
Baking is the way to go.

1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:35.760
Now you brush on
some oil on that.

1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:36.920
Yeah.

1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:39.840
Good. Bit of salt.

1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:41.000
Yeah.

1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:43.200
Beautiful.

1:22:43.280 --> 1:22:46.080
And in the oven, medium heat,
for 20 minutes.

1:22:46.840 --> 1:22:47.960
OK.

1:22:48.040 --> 1:22:50.320
Now, for the meat sauce.

1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:55.440
Don't start crying on me, George,
or I'll start crying too.

1:22:55.520 --> 1:22:56.680
Yeah.

1:22:56.760 --> 1:22:57.880
(CHUCKLES)

1:22:57.960 --> 1:23:00.400
And into the frying pan.

1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:02.480
Put some garlic in.

1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:03.760
Dry oregano.

1:23:04.720 --> 1:23:06.240
Bit of salt.

1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:08.760
Lamb mince meat, OK?

1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:11.280
Italians, they like their pork,
they like their beef.

1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:13.440
But for us Greeks,
it's all about lamb.

1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:16.040
In goes the meat.

1:23:16.640 --> 1:23:17.800
Canned tomatoes.

1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:20.320
And wine.

1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:22.560
You know what I use
in my bolognaise?

1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:23.880
Milk.

1:23:24.800 --> 1:23:26.360
To make it nice
and creamy, right?

1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:27.520
Yeah.

1:23:28.680 --> 1:23:29.960
Cheers.

1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:31.280
Cheers, George.

1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:36.440
Hey, so you, um...

1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:40.080
You know how
I got that problem?

1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:41.440
Yeah, what is it?

1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:44.320
Um, well I'm sure
you've heard, you know?

1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:46.480
Someone tried to have a go at me,
and it was er...

1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:47.960
Mum, you alright?

1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:51.360
Sorry, mate, gotta help Mum
with the toilet.

1:23:51.440 --> 1:23:53.760
Can you keep an eye
on the eggplant for me?

1:23:54.600 --> 1:23:55.720
Yeah.

1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:13.320
MAN: Let's do it.
60 seconds on the clock.

1:24:13.400 --> 1:24:14.960
Best of luck.
Thank you.

1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:16.640
And your time starts now.

1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:18.200
Which team in
the English Premier League

1:24:18.280 --> 1:24:19.520
is nicknamed The Hammers?

1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:20.840
West Ham.

1:24:20.920 --> 1:24:22.720
Hammersmith.

Friends.

1:24:28.840 --> 1:24:30.240
Pass.
Friends.

1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:32.040
A well known
Shakespearean sonnet begins,

1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:34.120
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's..." What?

1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:35.440
Day.
Morning.

1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:36.600
Day.

1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:38.680
The UNESCO World Heritage
site Museum Island

1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:40.200
is in which city?

1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:41.800
Berlin.
Pass.

1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:43.080
Berlin.

1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:45.520
A common expression of happiness is,
"You wouldn't be dead for..."

1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:46.880
What?
Quids.

1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:47.960
Quids.
Correct.

1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:49.120
And Rebecca Gibney played a mechanic

'Flying Doctors'.

1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:54.960

What is the square root of 25?

1:24:56.520 --> 1:24:57.600
Five.

1:24:58.400 --> 1:24:59.680
Five.
Correct.

1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:02.800
Hey, well done Nick. (LAUGHS)

1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:04.400
You've whipped up $8,000.

1:25:04.480 --> 1:25:05.480
Hey, George.

1:25:07.480 --> 1:25:08.960
Looks like lasagne, huh?

1:25:09.040 --> 1:25:10.240
Yeah.

1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:11.480
In the corners.

1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:14.640
In the oven for 45 minutes.

1:25:17.960 --> 1:25:19.080
That looks good, huh?

1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:20.200
Huh?

1:25:20.280 --> 1:25:21.480
Yeah, here mate.

1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:23.920
There.

1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.280
So you know I said there's a bit of
shit goin' on with me?

1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:27.560
What shit?

1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:30.160
Well, there's blokes
after me and stuff.

1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:32.280
Hey, there's a price on my head.

1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:36.040
Um... I don't mean to be rude,

1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:38.800
but could we talk about this
after dinner?

1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:40.680
Yeah, why?

1:25:41.560 --> 1:25:43.200
I just wanna focus
on making dinner.

1:25:43.280 --> 1:25:44.960
Mum's getting hungry.
I'm only here once a week.

1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:46.760
You know how it is.
Yeah.

1:25:46.840 --> 1:25:53.160
And after dinner's a better time
to talk about this sort of stuff.

1:25:53.240 --> 1:25:55.200
OK, yeah, yeah. No worries.
No worries.

1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:03.280
Heh, what do you think?

1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:06.840
It's beautiful.
Huh?

1:26:06.920 --> 1:26:08.200
It's really good.

1:26:09.800 --> 1:26:11.640
Mum, you happy?

1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:15.720
Yeah. Happy. (CHUCKLES)

1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:20.760
See, Mum has this for
the rest of the week, right?

1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:22.560
All she has to do
is put in the microwave

1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:23.840
and that's it.

1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:26.200
I've got other stuff for her
cooked in the freezer.

1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:28.000
But hey, look, see?

1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:29.360
Put labels on everything.

1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:32.360
She gets hungry, all she has
to do, just pull it out.

1:26:36.480 --> 1:26:39.640
Hey, so George, I was just
wondering if you know,

1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:42.920
maybe we can talk about seeing if
you can sort out that thing for me?

1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:45.880
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sorry, mate, sorry.

1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:48.000
Sorry it's taken me so long
to get around to it.

1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:50.120
Talk me through it.

1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:52.640
Someone's got it in for me.

1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:54.560
I don't know who it is,

1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:56.640
but someone out there
wants to fuck me up.

1:26:56.720 --> 1:26:57.880
You know?

1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:00.360
I was just wondering
if you know anything.

1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:03.080
No, mate. I don't.

1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:07.080
I was wondering maybe, you know,
if you could make some calls.

1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:08.520
See if anyone's heard anything.

1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:10.240
Who am I gonna call?

1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:11.520
I don't know.

1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:14.640
Maybe some of the big-time
blokes or something.

1:27:16.320 --> 1:27:18.280
To see if anyone's
heard anything, you know?

1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:19.840
Like, can you do that for me?

1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:22.160
I don't know, mate.

1:27:23.240 --> 1:27:25.080
Not sure what I'm gonna be
able to do for you.

1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:29.720
I can give it a go, I guess.

1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:32.440
Can't promise you anything.

1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:34.280
Yeah, that's all
I need, you know?

1:27:34.360 --> 1:27:36.160
And maybe if we find out who it is,

1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:37.920
you know, we can do like
a peace deal or something.

1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:39.120
A peace deal?

1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:40.480
Yeah.
What do you mean by that?

1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:42.440
Like if you find
out who's got it in for me

1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:45.040
then maybe you can let 'em,
you know, I got cash and stuff.

1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:46.280
I'll give 'em, you know,

1:27:46.360 --> 1:27:48.200
maybe part of my crane business
or something.

1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:49.680
You know what I'm saying, like...

1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:51.040
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:53.960
But I don't know what...
Well, what are you saying?

1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:57.400
Just if you find out
who's got it in for me,

1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:01.240
then just let 'em know, you know,
I wanna make things right.

1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:04.280
Like give 'em cash
and stuff, yeah?

1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:08.560
Yeah, sure, mate. Sure.

1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:10.560
I can't promise you anything,
but hey...

1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:12.640
..I'll see what I can do, OK?

1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:16.080
Hey, thanks a lot, George.
See you soon.

1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:17.360
Thanks for the dinner, yeah?

1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:19.000
Hey, next time you're making
the moussaka, yeah?

1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:21.400
Or lasagne. Much better.

1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:22.680
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:28:22.760 --> 1:28:24.400
You be careful
what you say, hey?

1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:27.400
Because we Greeks, we take
that shit very seriously.

1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:30.760
(LAUGHTER)

1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:37.080
Good to see you, mate.

1:28:37.160 --> 1:28:39.080
Hey, thanks heaps, George.
You'll make some calls, yeah?

1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:40.400
I'll do what I can.

1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:02.960
