Hey-o!

01:07.402 --> 01:09.654
But let me just say,
for 40 years,

01:09.737 --> 01:12.949
my beautiful wife Munda
has been by my side,

01:13.074 --> 01:16.828
even that year my side mutated
into some kind of venomous radish.

01:16.953 --> 01:20.707
And, Morris, I fell in love
with your honesty and humility.

01:20.790 --> 01:23.251
And those things
never mutated.

01:24.961 --> 01:26.004
ALL: Aw!

01:26.087 --> 01:27.797

In their 40 years together,

01:39.183 --> 01:41.686
my parents have
been through so much.

01:41.811 --> 01:43.605
Well, not that much, actually,

01:43.688 --> 01:46.774
since mutants weren't allowed to
leave the sewers until last year.

01:46.858 --> 01:49.569

Am I right?

02:07.211 --> 02:09.297

02:09.380 --> 02:11.549
I've been telling
you for 40 years,

02:11.633 --> 02:14.260
it's the study of
alien languages.

02:14.427 --> 02:15.553
Why can't you listen?

02:15.637 --> 02:16.846
Oh, sugar lump,

02:16.929 --> 02:20.058
I hear you when you actually
say something important.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.310

opposites attract,

02:22.393 --> 02:25.563

face mutant and butt mutant,

02:25.647 --> 02:29.442

has grown stronger every day.

02:29.567 --> 02:31.486
MUNDA: "Something important"?

02:31.903 --> 02:33.821
Exolinguistics
was my passion.

02:33.905 --> 02:37.700
Until I gave it up to go into the
lucrative pot-roast-making field.

02:37.784 --> 02:39.160

02:39.243 --> 02:41.579

that alien junk anyway.

We can't even see the stars
down here in the sewer.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.416

02:45.625 --> 02:48.503
I did accept it. For 40 years!

02:48.586 --> 02:50.672
But now we're
free to go up there.

02:50.755 --> 02:53.633
I could be in space seeing
things I've only dreamed about,

02:53.716 --> 02:55.301

up for you. Happily!

03:06.312 --> 03:08.523
I just want a little
more out of life.

03:08.606 --> 03:13.111
But no, you don't want to go into
space because you're too afraid.

you dude, princess?

Look, I don't want to put
a rat in your face-cage,

12:02.056 --> 12:04.058
or whatever you
kids say nowadays,

12:04.141 --> 12:07.853

me, and I'm going to prove it!

Well, if it isn't my second
favorite Turanga girl.

12:20.366 --> 12:22.368
Hi, Zapp. I was
wondering if you'd like

12:22.451 --> 12:24.411
to have dinner tonight
with me and my mom.

12:24.495 --> 12:26.956
You know, to celebrate
your genuine love for her.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.207
Sounds good.

12:28.290 --> 12:31.543
And don't forget my genuine
love for Parmezian cheese.

12:31.669 --> 12:35.673
Shall we say about 7:58?
Precisely?

12:41.011 --> 12:42.596
Nice to see you, Zapp.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.599
Well, nice to see a surprising
amount of you, too, Leela.

12:45.683 --> 12:46.850
Is Munda here?

12:46.934 --> 12:49.228
Mommy's not home, big boy.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.605
We both know you're just
using her to get to me.

12:51.689 --> 12:55.943
So let's do it right here
by the front door at 7:59.

12:56.360 --> 13:00.197

you're using her pole?

13:04.368 --> 13:05.619
Come on, I'm all yours!

13:05.703 --> 13:08.289
Have your way with me
for the next 30 seconds.

13:08.497 --> 13:10.457
That would be more
than enough time,

13:10.541 --> 13:12.084
but I can't. I love Munda.

13:12.543 --> 13:15.713
I love everything about her,
her laugh, her maturity,

13:15.796 --> 13:19.300
the cold, lifeless touch
of her tentacle on my body.

13:19.383 --> 13:22.511
She is one juicy calamari.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.306
Oh, Zapp, I love you, too.

13:29.727 --> 13:33.022
and, well, here in front
of your half-naked daughter

13:33.105 --> 13:34.898
seems like the perfect time.

13:35.316 --> 13:38.277
Darling will I marry you?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.404
Of course,
I'll marry you, Zapp.

Leela, here's $40.

13:49.872 --> 13:53.625
Mom, don't do this. Zapp is a
selfish, womanizing idiot.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.003
There's no need to
call me names, Leela.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.297
Just call me, "Daddy."

13:58.964 --> 14:01.258

14:06.347 --> 14:08.182
Mom, if you try to marry Zapp,

14:08.265 --> 14:10.434
I will shove you into
a filthy nursing home

14:10.559 --> 14:12.728
so fast you won't
know what hit you.

14:13.395 --> 14:15.272
Probably, it'll be
a filthy nurse.

14:15.356 --> 14:18.859
Leela, you're my daughter
and I love you, but cram it!

14:19.276 --> 14:20.527
Is this a bad time?

14:20.611 --> 14:22.446
I was riding the El Torito
dinner backwash,

14:22.529 --> 14:23.697
and I thought I'd pop in.

14:23.781 --> 14:24.990
Oh, thank God you're here.

14:25.074 --> 14:28.410
If we don't do something, Mom's
going to marry Zapp Brannigan.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.704
So? He seems
like a nice kahuna.

14:30.788 --> 14:33.165
Dad, stop being so mellow.

14:33.248 --> 14:35.167
Leela, honey, chill out.

14:35.459 --> 14:37.544
You got to take
the good with the gnarly.

14:37.628 --> 14:41.340
Speaking of which, time for me
to shoot the IHOP dessert curl.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.050
Ugh!

14:49.473 --> 14:52.393
Aw! You sure you won't come
to your mom's wedding?

14:52.476 --> 14:54.311
There'll be chicken
or fish, circle one.

14:54.395 --> 14:57.022
I can't. Not when I
believe with all my heart

14:57.106 --> 14:58.649
that this marriage
is a mistake.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.568
I know you're upset
that your parents broke up.

15:01.652 --> 15:04.405
But what if Zapp
really does make Munda happy?

15:04.738 --> 15:06.698
What if they're
meant to be together?

15:06.949 --> 15:09.868
Fry, that's just so...
I can't even believe...

15:09.952 --> 15:12.037

only one who's marriage material.

much sucker for a lady my age?

Just the right amount.
You'll make a lovely bride.

Zapp, honey,
this is the wrong document.

It's not a peace treaty. It says
they're declaring war on us.

Brilliant, isn't I?
