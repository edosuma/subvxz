00:00.402 --> 00:01.642
<i>Previously on Cedar Cove...</i>

00:01.769 --> 00:03.520
Linnette: We should stay away from Gloria.

00:03.520 --> 00:05.177
He thinks that she's
stolen someone's identity.

00:05.177 --> 00:08.206
- I'm staying in Cedar Cove.
- Well, the job is here, in Seattle.

00:08.901 --> 00:10.517
You are on probation.

00:10.616 --> 00:13.127
If this case is not handled properly,
you will be out of a job.

00:13.192 --> 00:14.688
- She didn't come to work?
- Nope.

00:17.401 --> 00:19.168
The sheriff said that
because she's an adult,

00:19.170 --> 00:22.004
there's nothing they can do for 24 hours.

00:22.006 --> 00:24.673
What if she was kidnapped
or swept away in a flood?

00:24.675 --> 00:25.924
It's not raining out.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.943
Well, you're not ruling out kidnapping.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.244
Rebecca!

00:29.246 --> 00:30.846
Where were you?

00:30.848 --> 00:32.514
You disappeared, and you
didn't show up for work.

00:32.516 --> 00:35.450
- Paul was looking for you. He called.
- Several times.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.618
Yeah...

00:36.620 --> 00:38.053
I know.

00:38.055 --> 00:39.588
I missed two appearances.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.608
- I'm beat.
- No.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.158
Explanation. Now.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.638
Last night, I pulled
an all-nighter at work,

00:47.638 --> 00:48.477
and this morning,

00:48.636 --> 00:51.383
I had to drive all the way to
Brower County to file a motion

00:51.385 --> 00:53.035
to avoid a statute of limitations.

00:53.037 --> 00:54.319
On my way back, I was feeling tired,

00:54.321 --> 00:56.588
so I pulled off to the side of the road,

00:56.590 --> 00:58.006
and I closed my eyes for a second.

00:58.008 --> 00:59.608
I just woke up an hour ago.

00:59.610 --> 01:03.412
My phone was dead, and I had no charger.

01:03.414 --> 01:04.646
So, can I go now?

01:05.683 --> 01:09.017
- You're working too much.
- And too hard.

01:09.019 --> 01:10.919
Yeah, well, you can say, "I told you so,"

01:10.921 --> 01:12.254
but I'm going to go to bed.

01:12.256 --> 01:13.889
Excuse me.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.761
David won't budge

01:19.763 --> 01:21.430
on your working full time in Seattle?

01:21.432 --> 01:23.248
Not in the first year, no.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.300
He's a hands-on manager

01:25.302 --> 01:27.553
who apparently likes to
pop into the staff's office

01:27.555 --> 01:29.404
for brainstorming sessions, so...

01:30.624 --> 01:31.740
It's a great job.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.445
You're more important.
We're more important.

01:38.949 --> 01:40.265
You can't turn the job down

01:40.267 --> 01:43.291
just because it's going to be
hard for us to spend time together.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.029
- We'll have weekends.
- Yeah...

01:46.239 --> 01:48.322
until you have to prep
for a big court case,

01:48.324 --> 01:50.425
or I have a looming deadline.

01:52.228 --> 01:54.862
I have to ask you one more time...

01:55.832 --> 01:59.817
are you absolutely sure,
you support me taking this job?

02:02.105 --> 02:03.071
Olivia?

02:05.158 --> 02:06.874
Yes, Jack.

02:07.526 --> 02:10.193
Of course I support you taking this job.

02:37.707 --> 02:39.390
Thought I'd save your clerk the trip.

02:39.392 --> 02:40.641
Thanks.

02:40.642 --> 02:41.724
Any word from Rebecca?

02:41.726 --> 02:42.875
Ah, yes, finally.

02:42.877 --> 02:44.560
What happened to her?

02:44.562 --> 02:45.595
She didn't say.

02:45.597 --> 02:46.782
Well, that's not good.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.699
No. No, it's...

02:49.552 --> 02:51.268
not.

02:51.270 --> 02:52.319
Alex.

02:52.321 --> 02:53.237
Oh!

02:53.239 --> 02:54.371
I take it things went well.

02:54.373 --> 02:55.589
The game was great.

02:55.591 --> 02:56.473
And the company?

02:56.475 --> 02:58.108
She's, uh...

02:58.110 --> 02:59.109
affable.

02:59.111 --> 03:00.461
Affable?

03:00.463 --> 03:01.895
How romantic.

03:01.897 --> 03:03.147
That's me.

03:03.148 --> 03:05.465
You went to a baseball game with Alex,

03:05.467 --> 03:08.117
and all you have to say is she's affable?

03:08.120 --> 03:10.988
Could... could we not talk about this?

03:10.990 --> 03:13.056
Okay.

03:13.057 --> 03:14.991
I should get ready for court.

03:22.735 --> 03:24.735
Roy: You seem off.

03:24.737 --> 03:26.870
What's up, honey?

03:26.872 --> 03:30.023
We waited too long to get
back to the adoption agency.

03:30.025 --> 03:31.658
Yes, but we did write back.

03:35.264 --> 03:36.263
Today's her birthday.

03:36.265 --> 03:38.365
I know. I remember.

03:38.367 --> 03:39.783
She'd be 28.

03:39.784 --> 03:42.351
Look, Corrie...

03:42.354 --> 03:43.520
we wrote them.

03:43.522 --> 03:45.155
The agency wrote our daughter,

03:45.157 --> 03:47.524
but then she didn't write them back.

03:47.526 --> 03:48.892
They said it's normal,

03:48.893 --> 03:51.327
that sometimes, people make an inquiry,

03:51.329 --> 03:53.896
but then they change their
mind about making contact.

03:53.898 --> 03:55.765
I know it sounds crazy,

03:55.767 --> 03:57.266
but I just thought this birthday,

03:57.268 --> 03:59.836
I'd spend it with her,
or at least talk to her.

04:00.939 --> 04:02.071
You could find her.

04:02.073 --> 04:04.974
But she doesn't want to be found.

04:04.977 --> 04:08.445
That's clear, or she
would have reached back.

04:08.447 --> 04:11.856
Neither one of us feel
good about this situation,

04:11.856 --> 04:14.067
but if she wants to be left alone,

04:14.069 --> 04:15.092
we should do that,

04:15.588 --> 04:17.009
no matter how difficult that is.

04:17.584 --> 04:18.719
When she's ready,

04:19.274 --> 04:21.646
all she has to do is contact the agency.

04:22.962 --> 04:23.861
Okay?

04:26.032 --> 04:27.330
Buck: I've gone over the proposal.

04:27.478 --> 04:28.672
Take a second look at the numbers.

04:28.676 --> 04:30.680
We're missing something here,
and I'm going to assume,

04:30.680 --> 04:32.763
since you barged into my
office without knocking,

04:32.911 --> 04:35.038
that you're having a medical emergency.

04:35.040 --> 04:35.923
Uh, no.

04:35.925 --> 04:37.182
- Fire drill?
- Giving notice?

04:37.347 --> 04:38.644
- You two having fun?
- Mm-hmm.

04:38.784 --> 04:40.284
Or maybe you've come to your senses,

04:40.284 --> 04:42.287
and you're ready to sign over
your half of Charlotte's house.

04:42.412 --> 04:43.670
No, Dad, that's not
the reason I'm here.

04:43.670 --> 04:45.399
I'm here because I want
to talk to you about a deal.

04:45.401 --> 04:47.326
- E-mail me the specs.
- Unfortunately, I can't do that.

04:47.326 --> 04:48.434
There's a deadline.

04:48.434 --> 04:51.788
And since I can no longer pull the
trigger on a deal by myself...

04:51.790 --> 04:53.207
Leave the proposal on my desk.

04:53.209 --> 04:54.791
I'll have a look at it when I get back.

04:54.793 --> 04:55.959
Thanks.

04:59.532 --> 05:00.607
Okay, what are you up to?

05:00.662 --> 05:02.132
What do you mean? Who
says I'm up to anything?

05:02.134 --> 05:03.567
You were practically civil.

05:03.569 --> 05:06.320
You know, Alex, this is very sad.

05:06.322 --> 05:08.400
Oh, you're so jaded
for such a young person.

05:13.178 --> 05:14.273
You don't have to say any more.

05:14.413 --> 05:15.570
If you want me to move out, fine.

05:15.570 --> 05:16.659
Message received.

05:16.830 --> 05:18.918
I just want you to take
responsibility for yourself.

05:19.066 --> 05:20.533
I do.

05:20.536 --> 05:22.703
You don't!

05:22.705 --> 05:24.221
I want things to be better with us.

05:24.223 --> 05:26.223
You're my sister.

05:26.225 --> 05:27.424
If you're serious

05:27.426 --> 05:29.159
about us having a real relationship...

05:29.161 --> 05:30.210
I am.

05:30.212 --> 05:32.896
Okay, clean slate, fresh start.

05:32.898 --> 05:34.147
Stay as long as you need to.

05:34.149 --> 05:36.083
Just wear pants.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.035
One time!

05:38.037 --> 05:39.753
Seeing my brother at 6:00 in the morning

05:39.755 --> 05:40.837
in his boxers

05:40.839 --> 05:43.273
is one time too many.

05:43.275 --> 05:45.275
Got it. Pants.

05:47.012 --> 05:49.696
Is Rebecca okay?

05:49.698 --> 05:52.082
Yeah, I think.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.869
Are we okay?

05:57.623 --> 06:00.507
Still just trying to
wrap my head around this.

06:00.509 --> 06:03.527
You really don't want to have children?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.796
It just seems so extreme.

06:07.383 --> 06:09.533
I'm not going to change my mind.

06:10.402 --> 06:12.302
How do you know?

06:13.505 --> 06:15.188
Matt and Missy are struggling.

06:15.190 --> 06:15.939
Yeah...

06:15.941 --> 06:17.574
Part of that struggle

06:17.576 --> 06:18.458
is because Missy wants things from Matt

06:18.460 --> 06:19.927
that he can't give her.

06:19.929 --> 06:21.645
So you don't even want to get married?

06:22.481 --> 06:24.114
Marriage, yes...

06:24.116 --> 06:25.349
maybe.

06:26.117 --> 06:27.950
But kids? No.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.137
I'm not a white picket fence guy.

06:31.139 --> 06:32.154
I love you,

06:32.157 --> 06:33.523
but I'm never going to be

06:33.525 --> 06:35.792
that guy driving around in a minivan.

06:35.794 --> 06:37.094
Sorry.

06:51.276 --> 06:54.277
Okay, what's wrong?

06:54.279 --> 06:55.379
Court?

06:55.381 --> 06:56.763
Justine?

06:56.765 --> 06:58.148
Will?

06:58.150 --> 07:00.117
Ah, going to ask you that one again.

07:00.119 --> 07:02.252
Is it Will?

07:02.254 --> 07:04.004
You know it's Jack.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.322
I do, I just thought it would be easier

07:05.324 --> 07:08.075
if you didn't know that I knew it was Jack.

07:08.077 --> 07:09.359
His job in Seattle

07:09.361 --> 07:11.061
requires him to be in Seattle.

07:11.063 --> 07:12.262
He'll have to commute.

07:12.264 --> 07:13.447
Well, but...

07:13.449 --> 07:14.731
then you two won't see each other much.

07:14.733 --> 07:16.833
I know.

07:16.835 --> 07:19.236
But if you lived together...

07:19.238 --> 07:21.038
It may be the only way
we get to see each other

07:21.040 --> 07:22.089
during the week.

07:22.091 --> 07:22.939
Well, has he asked you again?

07:22.941 --> 07:24.508
No.

07:24.510 --> 07:25.993
But even if he had,

07:25.995 --> 07:27.544
I don't think that convenience

07:27.546 --> 07:29.479
should be the main reason
for living together.

07:29.481 --> 07:31.548
Well, you and Jack have
been through tougher things

07:31.550 --> 07:33.483
than a long-distance relationship.

07:33.485 --> 07:36.853
Have faith... It's all going to work out.

07:36.855 --> 07:38.422
So...

07:39.224 --> 07:40.524
Maryellen and I

07:40.526 --> 07:42.426
are almost finished planning your shower.

07:43.679 --> 07:46.063
Ooh! I want all the details right now!

07:46.065 --> 07:47.364
So, um...

07:47.366 --> 07:50.984
where? When? Theme? Food? Game?

07:50.986 --> 07:52.002
You really want to know?

07:52.004 --> 07:53.370
I do, I do, I do.

07:53.372 --> 07:54.771
No.

07:54.773 --> 07:56.273
It's supposed to be a surprise.

07:57.159 --> 07:58.275
Right.

07:58.277 --> 08:00.043
But I do have to call Moon's.

08:00.045 --> 08:01.678
Moon's?

08:01.680 --> 08:03.647
This is not a Super Bowl
party. This is a shower.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.082
This is my shower.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.850
That was a test. And you failed.

08:06.852 --> 08:08.919
Of course I'm not going
to have it at Moon's.

08:08.921 --> 08:10.454
But come on, Grace.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.055
Just relax.

08:12.057 --> 08:14.958
Let me and Maryellen surprise you for once.

08:14.960 --> 08:18.495
You are so right.

08:18.497 --> 08:19.763
As of right now.

08:19.765 --> 08:23.133
This is the new easy-peasy Grace.

08:23.135 --> 08:26.103
I'm just going to sit
back and enjoy my party.

08:26.105 --> 08:27.571
That wouldn't be a new leaf.

08:27.573 --> 08:29.206
That would be a whole new tree.

08:29.208 --> 08:32.174
Oh, you just wait and see.

08:32.177 --> 08:33.909
You're the one who's going to be surprised.

08:33.912 --> 08:35.445
Mm.

08:35.447 --> 08:37.364
Easy peasy.

08:41.986 --> 08:43.186
Miss Jennings...

08:43.188 --> 08:45.705
Welcome back.

08:45.707 --> 08:47.624
I think we need to talk.

08:47.626 --> 08:49.576
End of the day.

08:59.471 --> 09:00.637
Linnette.

09:01.740 --> 09:03.123
Hey.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.241
I have to go.

09:04.243 --> 09:05.275
Rebecca's lying about me.

09:05.277 --> 09:07.244
My driver's license.

09:07.246 --> 09:08.411
Oh...

09:08.413 --> 09:10.163
Rebecca totally has it out for me.

09:10.165 --> 09:12.449
I don't know why. I haven't done anything.

09:12.451 --> 09:13.934
Let me explain... please.

09:13.936 --> 09:15.368
I really have to go...

09:15.370 --> 09:17.254
I just want to be your friend.

09:17.256 --> 09:20.490
Okay.

09:20.492 --> 09:22.993
My car's over there. I
could give you a ride.

09:27.499 --> 09:29.166
I really have to go. I'm late.

09:32.604 --> 09:35.806
So I see you're seeking a
permanent order of protection

09:35.808 --> 09:36.773
against your husband.

09:36.775 --> 09:38.341
Yes, your honor.

09:38.343 --> 09:40.210
And a temporary order
was issued two weeks ago,

09:40.212 --> 09:42.229
ex-parte...

09:42.231 --> 09:44.214
without any input from your husband.

09:46.218 --> 09:48.518
And this hearing today is
your husband's opportunity

09:48.520 --> 09:50.954
to offer any testimony or evidence

09:50.956 --> 09:51.955
against your request...

09:51.957 --> 09:54.791
but I do not see him.

09:54.793 --> 09:56.092
No, your honor.

09:56.094 --> 09:56.993
And was he served papers?

09:56.995 --> 09:59.029
Yes.

09:59.031 --> 10:00.630
And he was aware of the court date?

10:00.632 --> 10:01.731
Yes.

10:01.733 --> 10:03.733
But he... chose not to show?

10:03.735 --> 10:07.370
I haven't spoken to him
since the... incident.

10:07.372 --> 10:09.739
I've been staying with my parents.

10:09.741 --> 10:11.441
Why don't you tell me what happened?

10:12.744 --> 10:14.444
A couple weeks ago,

10:14.446 --> 10:17.514
Tom, my husband, we...

10:17.516 --> 10:19.216
we had a fight.

10:19.218 --> 10:22.752
It was silly, something
about work or my job, and...

10:23.522 --> 10:26.323
things got out of hand.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.492
He pushed me. I fell.

10:29.494 --> 10:31.094
I had to go to the emergency room.

10:31.096 --> 10:32.529
I sprained my wrist.

10:34.066 --> 10:36.132
I didn't know what to do,

10:36.134 --> 10:38.902
and my parents helped me file
that paperwork to protect me.

10:38.904 --> 10:40.770
Well...

10:40.772 --> 10:44.541
seeing that your husband
has chosen not to appear,

10:44.543 --> 10:45.508
I have no choice but to...

10:46.445 --> 10:47.544
Wait!

10:47.546 --> 10:49.579
You do not rush into my court

10:49.581 --> 10:50.547
and tell me to wait.

10:50.549 --> 10:51.781
I'm sorry.

10:51.783 --> 10:52.883
You are in contempt of this court,

10:52.885 --> 10:55.151
of this proceeding, and me.

10:55.153 --> 10:57.854
Please, let me explain...
I'm Lisa's husband.

10:57.856 --> 10:59.439
I know who you are.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.125
We will take a short recess.

11:14.973 --> 11:15.989
Jack.

11:15.991 --> 11:17.574
David.

11:17.576 --> 11:18.408
First day.

11:18.410 --> 11:20.043
That it is.

11:20.045 --> 11:21.878
I was on my way up to see you.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.697
That's funny, I was just
coming by to see you.

11:23.699 --> 11:24.648
Fortuitous.

11:24.650 --> 11:25.799
It would appear so.

11:25.801 --> 11:28.335
What do you think of Eddie Wilson?

11:28.337 --> 11:31.688
Uh... he's young, but eager.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.156
He's a pretty good writer.

11:33.158 --> 11:36.927
I think he'd make a great number two.

11:36.929 --> 11:38.428
For me?

11:38.430 --> 11:40.030
Well, your old position is open now.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.882
Yeah, but I kind of figured
I'd find my own number two.

11:42.884 --> 11:44.868
Ah, you're going to love Eddie.

11:46.571 --> 11:48.471
Uh, okay. Sure.

11:48.473 --> 11:50.173
I'll talk with him.

11:50.175 --> 11:51.608
Good.

11:51.610 --> 11:53.276
Now, what did you need from me?

11:53.278 --> 11:55.679
Holt Prison has had a number
of recent prison breaks

11:55.681 --> 11:56.730
this past year,

11:56.732 --> 11:57.597
and I think that their security,

11:57.599 --> 11:58.782
or lack thereof,

11:58.784 --> 11:59.950
needs to be looked at.

11:59.952 --> 12:02.118
I have one of their prison guards

12:02.120 --> 12:03.386
willing to talk to me off the record,

12:03.388 --> 12:05.288
but even better than that,

12:05.290 --> 12:06.489
I have one of the inmates

12:06.491 --> 12:07.991
who escaped early this year

12:07.993 --> 12:09.592
also willing to talk.

12:09.594 --> 12:12.128
- I like it.
- Yeah? Great!

12:12.130 --> 12:14.030
All right, I've got a meeting
set up for tomorrow.

12:14.032 --> 12:17.082
- Give the information to Eddie.
- What?

12:17.228 --> 12:18.995
I want Eddie to take this and run with it.

12:19.012 --> 12:20.242
No, no, no, no. No.

12:21.572 --> 12:22.484
No?

12:27.320 --> 12:28.310
No?

12:29.050 --> 12:31.651
David, I'm in charge of the whole paper.

12:31.653 --> 12:33.586
I assign the stories.

12:33.588 --> 12:36.856
Now, look, this guard and inmate,
they're not going to talk to somebody

12:36.858 --> 12:38.024
they've never met before.

12:38.026 --> 12:40.209
It's not just about
reporting anymore for you.

12:40.211 --> 12:41.361
Now it's about the bottom line...

12:41.363 --> 12:43.463
sales, numbers, meeting projections.

12:43.465 --> 12:44.764
Listen, David,

12:44.766 --> 12:46.549
I have spent months setting up this story.

12:46.551 --> 12:49.280
You need to focus on getting up to speed.

12:49.893 --> 12:51.868
You need to be looking
at the bigger picture.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.988
Your wife is seeking
an order of protection,

13:08.990 --> 13:10.990
and you admit to pushing her.

13:10.992 --> 13:12.458
This seems pretty cut and dry.

13:12.460 --> 13:14.527
I pushed her in self-defense.

13:14.529 --> 13:16.129
E-Excuse me?

13:17.399 --> 13:18.781
We both have tempers.

13:18.783 --> 13:20.333
We do.

13:20.335 --> 13:22.485
She said some things, I said some things.

13:22.487 --> 13:24.337
I should have just
walked away, but I didn't,

13:24.339 --> 13:26.472
and now I'm here,

13:26.474 --> 13:27.840
and I want my wife back.

13:27.842 --> 13:30.410
The question is not whether you
get your wife back or not.

13:30.412 --> 13:32.095
The question is whether your wife

13:32.097 --> 13:33.880
needs a protective order from the court

13:33.882 --> 13:35.848
to guarantee her safety and well-being.

13:35.850 --> 13:37.850
She doesn't.

13:37.852 --> 13:40.053
I swear.

13:40.055 --> 13:43.923
We took vows... for better or worse.

13:43.925 --> 13:45.825
This is worse...

13:45.827 --> 13:48.995
but I am totally committed
to making our marriage work.

13:48.997 --> 13:50.630
I love my wife.

13:50.632 --> 13:51.998
I miss her.

13:53.501 --> 13:54.834
I want her back.

13:58.473 --> 13:59.472
Alex: Okay.

13:59.474 --> 14:01.491
What game are you running?

14:01.493 --> 14:02.458
What do you mean?

14:02.460 --> 14:03.676
I mean the deal

14:03.678 --> 14:05.611
that you want Buck to go in on with you.

14:05.613 --> 14:06.713
Alex, come on, it's a great deal.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.631
For Saget... not for you.

14:09.984 --> 14:11.484
- Really?
- Oh, please.

14:11.486 --> 14:12.919
You know as well as I do

14:12.921 --> 14:14.353
that the deal indemnifies the Saget company

14:14.355 --> 14:15.988
for any possible legal action,

14:15.990 --> 14:17.490
but not you,

14:17.492 --> 14:19.346
since you'll be investing as an individual.

14:19.932 --> 14:22.604
There's no mention of
individual indemnification.

14:25.369 --> 14:27.233
But Buck and the company
would be protected.

14:27.235 --> 14:31.571
There is no way that you
would expose yourself like this.

14:31.573 --> 14:34.874
This is clearly a fake deal and a scam.

14:34.876 --> 14:38.244
Now, do you want to tell Buck,

14:38.246 --> 14:39.645
or should I?

14:42.517 --> 14:44.333
Sorry.

14:44.335 --> 14:45.668
I'm sorry, I...  Um...

14:45.670 --> 14:48.354
Okay, you got me. All right? It's a test.

14:48.356 --> 14:49.622
A test?

14:49.624 --> 14:50.623
Yes. I'm so sick and tired

14:50.625 --> 14:52.258
of listening to Buck

14:52.260 --> 14:53.893
always insist that he has
my best interests at heart.

14:53.895 --> 14:55.695
So when he takes this deal,
I will be proven right.

14:55.697 --> 14:58.397
And what do you get out
of being proven right?

14:58.399 --> 14:59.982
A bad deal and the knowledge

14:59.984 --> 15:01.501
that your father will
sell you out for money?

15:01.503 --> 15:03.202
Uh, yeah, hello. That's the point.

15:03.204 --> 15:04.804
Okay.

15:04.806 --> 15:08.040
You two take dysfunctional
to the next level.

15:08.042 --> 15:09.592
But we're Sagets! It's what we do.

15:09.594 --> 15:11.711
We pride ourselves on not being average.

15:11.713 --> 15:13.212
You should be really proud,

15:13.214 --> 15:15.047
because you two really
excel at dysfunction.

15:15.049 --> 15:16.399
Thank you.

15:16.401 --> 15:18.618
It's not a compliment.

15:23.525 --> 15:25.108
Peace offering.

15:25.110 --> 15:26.542
You didn't do anything

15:26.544 --> 15:28.261
that requires a peace offering.

15:28.263 --> 15:29.595
But I'll take the latte.

15:29.597 --> 15:30.930
And the company.

15:30.932 --> 15:32.665
I think I owe you an apology,

15:32.667 --> 15:34.600
although I don't know what I did.

15:36.237 --> 15:37.303
You touched a nerve.

15:37.305 --> 15:38.888
A nerve?

15:38.890 --> 15:41.274
Yeah. A pretty raw one.

15:41.276 --> 15:43.943
Did things not go well with Alex?

15:43.945 --> 15:45.228
No, no, they went well.

15:45.230 --> 15:47.964
And I could have handled that.

15:47.966 --> 15:49.632
Uh, she asked me out.

15:49.634 --> 15:51.484
This time, it's a date.
She made that clear.

15:51.486 --> 15:52.819
Straightforward.

15:52.821 --> 15:53.920
Yep.

15:53.922 --> 15:54.754
Too much so?

15:54.756 --> 15:56.055
Uh, no.

15:56.057 --> 15:57.557
No, I like people who say what they mean,

15:57.559 --> 15:59.792
mean what they say.

15:59.794 --> 16:02.695
I'm just not even ready
for the idea of this.

16:02.697 --> 16:04.447
Dating. Relationships.

16:04.449 --> 16:06.165
Marriage. Another divorce.

16:06.167 --> 16:08.100
Wow.

16:08.102 --> 16:10.603
In the span of 10 seconds,
you just got a divorce

16:10.605 --> 16:12.238
from someone you haven't even dated yet.

16:14.025 --> 16:14.907
Okay.

16:14.909 --> 16:16.425
I get it.

16:16.427 --> 16:19.145
Divorce... Been there.

16:19.147 --> 16:20.613
Not sure you want to jump back in.

16:22.383 --> 16:24.843
My divorce... crushed me.

16:26.032 --> 16:28.055
That's what divorces do in the beginning.

16:28.056 --> 16:30.167
Yeah, but I didn't want my marriage to end.

16:30.339 --> 16:31.899
I mean, sometimes, marriages are hard work.

16:32.024 --> 16:33.456
Right? You don't give up.

16:33.507 --> 16:34.928
You don't quit. You don't walk away.

16:34.929 --> 16:36.696
And that's what she did.

16:36.698 --> 16:38.631
It crushed me.

16:38.633 --> 16:40.733
We took vows.

16:40.735 --> 16:43.236
We had a contract, and she... broke it.

16:43.238 --> 16:46.105
There is life after divorce.

16:46.107 --> 16:49.375
I will never go down that road again.

16:49.377 --> 16:50.910
You're never going to fall in love again?

16:50.912 --> 16:52.028
Correct.

16:52.030 --> 16:53.246
- Impossible.
- Possible.

16:53.248 --> 16:54.413
Not unless you close your heart off.

16:54.415 --> 16:55.381
Already done.

16:55.383 --> 16:56.883
It's not worth it.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.784
It's the only thing that is worth it.

16:58.786 --> 17:01.287
You just haven't met the right person yet.

17:01.289 --> 17:02.188
No...

17:02.190 --> 17:03.890
see, I did.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.156
And it didn't work out.

17:05.159 --> 17:06.659
I have to accept that.

17:06.661 --> 17:09.127
You just got divorced.

17:09.130 --> 17:10.997
You may change your mind.

17:14.602 --> 17:17.904
Not everyone gets to
have love in their life.

17:19.073 --> 17:21.574
Not everyone gets to have a partner.

17:24.212 --> 17:25.711
That's okay.

17:27.949 --> 17:29.582
Thanks for the latte.

17:37.041 --> 17:38.457
I couldn't resist.

17:38.459 --> 17:39.692
Ooh!

17:40.945 --> 17:41.944
Stamps.

17:41.946 --> 17:42.995
Yeah!

17:42.997 --> 17:43.879
Stamps?

17:43.881 --> 17:45.815
For the shower invitations.

17:45.817 --> 17:46.899
I sent them digitally.

17:46.901 --> 17:47.867
Oh.

17:47.869 --> 17:49.235
What?

17:49.237 --> 17:50.269
It's just that people
like paper invitations.

17:50.271 --> 17:51.570
The card stock,

17:51.572 --> 17:53.072
the teeny pieces of tissue paper,

17:53.074 --> 17:55.041
an envelope, a stamp...

17:55.043 --> 17:58.194
You can't very well press e-mails
into a scrapbook, now, can you?

17:58.196 --> 17:59.829
Everyone does everything online.

17:59.831 --> 18:01.714
Yeah, well, that depends
on the person, I guess.

18:01.716 --> 18:02.815
Personal preference.

18:02.817 --> 18:03.916
Uh-huh.

18:03.918 --> 18:06.335
But I'm sure your way is good too.

18:06.337 --> 18:09.822
Do you want me to send
out paper invitations?

18:09.824 --> 18:13.192
No, no, honey, you have
too much to do already.

18:13.194 --> 18:14.510
I'll do it.

18:14.512 --> 18:15.528
Mom...

18:15.530 --> 18:16.779
Don't worry about it.

18:16.781 --> 18:18.197
You just have to e-mail me the guest list,

18:18.199 --> 18:19.432
and I will take care of it.

18:19.434 --> 18:21.600
The shower is the day after tomorrow.

18:22.487 --> 18:24.103
I will do up an invitation

18:24.105 --> 18:26.584
- that people can remember my shower by.
- Mom...

18:26.675 --> 18:29.560
Olivia and I are supposed to be
doing everything for you, remember.

18:29.560 --> 18:30.819
It is one little thing.

18:31.015 --> 18:32.428
You don't even need to tell Olivia.

18:32.430 --> 18:34.897
Really... don't tell Olivia, okay?

18:34.899 --> 18:36.015
But...

18:36.017 --> 18:37.300
Because it's one little thing.

18:37.302 --> 18:39.251
It's one little thing.
It's so easy, breezy...

18:43.007 --> 18:44.507
Hey, sis.

18:44.509 --> 18:45.558
Hi.

18:46.561 --> 18:47.526
What's wrong?

18:48.429 --> 18:49.662
I have a slight problem.

18:51.849 --> 18:52.932
Oh...

18:54.952 --> 18:56.452
My car!

18:58.306 --> 18:59.939
Yeah, that's the problem.

19:01.409 --> 19:03.793
It's really just a little fender bender.

19:03.795 --> 19:05.444
Why didn't you bend your own fender?

19:06.280 --> 19:07.287
I was out of gas.

19:07.287 --> 19:09.875
- How did you get my keys?
- You left them on the counter.

19:09.926 --> 19:11.240
It was good that you rode your bike.

19:11.252 --> 19:13.971
- You didn't even call me!
- I was just running to the store.

19:13.971 --> 19:15.019
I wasn't driving cross country.

19:15.183 --> 19:16.195
I'm going to get your car fixed.

19:16.195 --> 19:18.506
And what about the fender
that bent my fender?

19:18.509 --> 19:19.582
Hardly a scratch.

19:19.762 --> 19:20.884
It's all good.

19:21.085 --> 19:22.355
- Really?
- Yup.

19:22.546 --> 19:23.978
And I'm going to take
your car into the shop,

19:23.978 --> 19:25.181
and I'm going to pay for everything.

19:25.336 --> 19:27.057
And I'm even going to get you a rental car.

19:28.753 --> 19:29.785
Okay.

19:29.787 --> 19:31.170
Okay?

19:31.172 --> 19:33.189
Just fix it.

19:43.451 --> 19:46.786
You had everyone worried.

19:46.788 --> 19:48.454
I filed the motion, didn't I?

19:49.757 --> 19:52.158
Yeah.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.293
But you missed a separate filing

19:54.295 --> 19:56.228
and two appearances.

19:57.899 --> 19:58.981
It won't happen again.

19:58.983 --> 20:00.166
No.

20:02.003 --> 20:03.135
It won't.

20:04.822 --> 20:06.839
I'm sorry, are you firing me?

20:08.009 --> 20:09.058
Suspending.

20:10.611 --> 20:11.911
You need a break, and I'm not sure

20:11.913 --> 20:13.546
if that break needs to be permanent.

20:13.548 --> 20:14.847
I need this job.

20:14.849 --> 20:17.583
You need to wake up and look around.

20:17.585 --> 20:19.055
- I'm awake.
- No, you're not.

20:19.055 --> 20:22.241
You're sleepwalking through this job
because you're so concentrated on mine.

20:22.290 --> 20:23.322
Huh?

20:23.324 --> 20:24.790
I have sat where you sit,

20:24.792 --> 20:26.258
and I think we both share a strong drive

20:26.260 --> 20:27.526
and a career ambition,

20:27.528 --> 20:29.662
but in order to one day do my job,

20:29.664 --> 20:31.564
you have to first do yours.

20:31.566 --> 20:34.433
I am the best A.D.A. you have.

20:34.435 --> 20:36.969
I am the hardest working A.D.A. you have.

20:36.971 --> 20:37.937
Yes...

20:37.939 --> 20:40.308
- to both of those things.
- And I'm a damn good attorney.

20:40.462 --> 20:42.041
You are a liability.

20:43.144 --> 20:44.777
So...

20:44.779 --> 20:47.880
you're suspending me
because I work too hard?

20:49.317 --> 20:50.716
That is one way of looking at it.

20:53.070 --> 20:55.387
But it is the wrong way.

21:11.719 --> 21:13.464
Please just... call me when it's ready.

21:13.632 --> 21:14.443
Thanks.

21:15.031 --> 21:17.138
Hey.

21:17.315 --> 21:21.000
How was Seattle, Chief
Editor Jack Griffith?

21:22.386 --> 21:24.026
Well, uh...

21:24.027 --> 21:26.961
David doesn't really want
me to be a reporter anymore.

21:26.963 --> 21:28.929
He wants me to focus more

21:28.931 --> 21:31.632
on the nuts and bolts of the job.

21:31.634 --> 21:32.867
But...

21:32.869 --> 21:34.935
You know what? I can do both.

21:34.937 --> 21:37.071
David doesn't know how fast
and how hard that I work.

21:37.073 --> 21:39.940
I can still run that
paper and be a reporter.

21:39.942 --> 21:40.941
I mean, that...

21:40.943 --> 21:43.661
that prison story...

21:43.663 --> 21:44.912
that story is mine.

21:44.914 --> 21:47.948
If you have a story to tell, tell it.

21:49.669 --> 21:51.635
You so believe in me, don't you?

21:51.637 --> 21:53.354
Always.

21:53.356 --> 21:57.324
And you can be very
persuasive when you want to be.

21:57.326 --> 21:58.642
Ah...

22:02.498 --> 22:04.465
Mm. How's that?

22:04.467 --> 22:06.467
Oh... persuaded.

22:08.621 --> 22:13.140
Just... do what you know is right.

22:13.142 --> 22:14.408
Run the paper.

22:17.513 --> 22:19.814
I'm getting freaked out.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.232
Well, just stay away from her.

22:21.234 --> 22:22.817
We're neighbors.

22:24.987 --> 22:27.588
Your mother wants you to move back home.

22:27.590 --> 22:28.889
No.

22:28.891 --> 22:32.193
I... I like my place and my roommates.

22:32.195 --> 22:33.844
Okay.

22:33.846 --> 22:35.129
Well, can you just keep
your distance from her

22:35.131 --> 22:37.765
until I get some more information?

22:37.767 --> 22:38.866
Okay, Dad.

22:38.868 --> 22:40.534
Love you.

22:40.536 --> 22:42.303
Love you too.

22:42.305 --> 22:43.087
I'll see you later.

22:43.089 --> 22:44.688
Okay.

22:58.087 --> 22:59.386
Tough day?

22:59.388 --> 23:00.788
Tough case.

23:00.790 --> 23:02.656
That you cannot talk about?

23:02.658 --> 23:04.258
Correct.

23:04.260 --> 23:05.543
Okay.

23:05.545 --> 23:07.628
So we will not talk about the case.

23:07.630 --> 23:09.563
And we won't talk about Rebecca.

23:09.565 --> 23:10.998
Why not?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.583
Because I think you're making a mistake,

23:12.585 --> 23:14.835
and it's none of my business
how you run your office.

23:14.837 --> 23:15.569
Fair enough.

23:17.807 --> 23:20.641
I heard Jack got a big job in Seattle.

23:20.643 --> 23:21.642
He did.

23:21.644 --> 23:22.743
Can we talk about that?

23:22.745 --> 23:23.878
Do you want to talk about that?

23:26.766 --> 23:28.249
Did you and your wife live together

23:28.251 --> 23:29.116
before you got married?

23:29.118 --> 23:30.534
No.

23:30.536 --> 23:32.169
I'm an old-fashioned guy.

23:32.171 --> 23:34.488
You never cease to surprise me.

23:36.793 --> 23:38.425
Did Jack ask you to move in with him?

23:38.427 --> 23:40.928
He did... a while back.

23:41.831 --> 23:44.415
But you didn't?

23:44.417 --> 23:46.317
Maybe you're an old-fashioned girl.

23:46.319 --> 23:48.435
It's more complicated than that.

23:51.507 --> 23:52.506
He was lying to me...

23:52.508 --> 23:54.475
for a while, as it turns out.

23:54.477 --> 23:56.443
I was devastated.

23:56.445 --> 24:00.231
I... almost ended the relationship.

24:03.452 --> 24:06.554
But people that love us can hurt us,

24:06.556 --> 24:08.272
and we can come back from that.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.176
How did we stop talking about you

24:12.178 --> 24:13.794
and start talking about me?

24:13.796 --> 24:16.113
And can we go back to talking about you?

24:18.000 --> 24:20.768
Why don't we just sit here and not talk?

24:20.770 --> 24:21.986
Sold.

24:25.007 --> 24:25.890
This is nice.

24:25.892 --> 24:27.241
You're still talking.

24:27.243 --> 24:28.075
I'm stopping.

24:28.077 --> 24:29.126
Still talking.

24:40.356 --> 24:42.823
Sorry, I'm not interested.

24:43.659 --> 24:44.642
Really?

24:44.644 --> 24:45.659
Yes.

24:45.661 --> 24:46.627
Are you sure?

24:46.629 --> 24:48.128
Yep.

24:48.130 --> 24:49.797
And I know you're not
going to listen to me,

24:49.799 --> 24:51.215
but I don't think you
should be interested either.

25:01.077 --> 25:02.810
He didn't take the deal.

25:03.713 --> 25:05.062
Did you warn him?

25:05.064 --> 25:06.580
You two and this range war thing

25:06.582 --> 25:07.615
you've got going on...

25:07.617 --> 25:08.816
I want no part of.

25:13.072 --> 25:15.456
I didn't warn him or talk to him.

25:18.077 --> 25:19.393
Oh... He's playing me.

25:19.395 --> 25:20.844
Or maybe he really cares,

25:20.846 --> 25:22.296
which I think he does.

25:22.298 --> 25:25.032
Okay, this whole mixed-up plan of yours

25:25.034 --> 25:26.584
was a test

25:26.586 --> 25:29.069
to see if Buck cares about
you more than the company.

25:29.071 --> 25:31.572
He just gave up a
no-brainer, easy-money deal.

25:31.574 --> 25:33.257
Warren...

25:33.259 --> 25:35.276
you've got the results from your test.

25:35.278 --> 25:36.227
You just don't like them.

25:36.229 --> 25:38.045
Alex,

25:38.047 --> 25:39.313
what you're not understanding
is, he knows I'm playing him,

25:39.315 --> 25:41.048
so he's playing me, and you know what?

25:41.050 --> 25:43.484
I'm going to play him right back.

25:47.640 --> 25:50.791
And what would you like this cake to say?

25:50.793 --> 25:51.709
Um...

25:51.711 --> 25:53.427
"Grace...

25:53.429 --> 25:57.081
wishing you a marriage showered in love."

25:59.035 --> 26:01.819
Are you planning your own wedding shower?

26:01.821 --> 26:03.370
No!

26:03.372 --> 26:05.389
I'm just, you know,
helping out here and there.

26:05.391 --> 26:08.943
Yeah, which includes this
cake, and light hors d'oeuvres,

26:08.945 --> 26:11.595
cookie favors, dessert trays times two...

26:11.597 --> 26:13.264
Don't forget the fruit bouquet.

26:13.266 --> 26:16.000
And the fruit bouquet. How could I forget?

26:16.002 --> 26:18.554
Sounds to me like you
are planning this shower.

26:18.554 --> 26:21.288
No, I'm not, I am simply
filling in the holes.

26:21.290 --> 26:23.157
You just can't help yourself, can you?

26:23.159 --> 26:25.292
I've known you for a long time.

26:25.294 --> 26:26.760
There's one thing you cannot stand.

26:26.762 --> 26:27.861
It is suspense.

26:27.863 --> 26:29.430
Okay, that is so not true.

26:29.432 --> 26:31.286
I quite like a good gotcha.

26:31.478 --> 26:35.006
You make me e-mail the daily
specials to you the night before.

26:36.464 --> 26:38.527
I thought you sent that
e-mail out to everybody.

26:38.697 --> 26:39.962
- Just to you.
- Right...

26:40.476 --> 26:41.492
Oh! Okay.

26:41.494 --> 26:42.793
So please remember...

26:42.795 --> 26:44.845
do not tell anybody that I was here.

26:44.847 --> 26:46.680
Especially anyone named Olivia?

26:46.682 --> 26:47.915
Exactly. So you got it?

26:48.668 --> 26:50.584
Got what?

26:50.586 --> 26:52.686
You're not here.

27:00.563 --> 27:01.495
What?

27:01.497 --> 27:03.797
Why aren't you at work?

27:05.668 --> 27:07.201
I'm not in the mood.

27:07.203 --> 27:10.176
- You can't treat us this way.
- It's not right.

27:10.573 --> 27:12.367
We care about you.

27:12.367 --> 27:13.657
We're just trying to help you.

27:16.962 --> 27:19.590
Rebecca, what is going on?

27:25.121 --> 27:27.054
You're dropping your protection order?

27:27.056 --> 27:29.173
I just want to get this over with.

27:29.175 --> 27:31.392
I miss Tom. I miss being with him.

27:31.394 --> 27:32.943
I just want to get my life back.

27:32.945 --> 27:35.713
He apologized. He won't do it again.

27:35.715 --> 27:37.398
He even said he would go to counseling.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.565
But if it's not mandatory...

27:38.567 --> 27:39.500
I trust him.

27:39.502 --> 27:41.935
But I think this is best.

27:41.937 --> 27:44.204
Lisa...

27:44.206 --> 27:45.305
I can help you.

27:47.143 --> 27:48.642
That's not necessary...

27:48.644 --> 27:50.344
but thank you.

27:58.421 --> 27:59.720
Thank you.

28:02.024 --> 28:03.374
David. Hi.

28:03.376 --> 28:05.526
Jack.

28:05.528 --> 28:06.927
Here, let's have a seat.

28:11.283 --> 28:14.301
You, ah, read my piece on Holt Prison?

28:17.123 --> 28:18.505
Look...

28:18.507 --> 28:20.090
as Chief Editor, I made a decision

28:20.092 --> 28:22.309
that falls within the parameters of my job.

28:22.311 --> 28:24.628
And now we have a problem.

28:24.630 --> 28:26.513
A big one.

28:26.515 --> 28:28.449
I told you I didn't want you to write it.

28:29.510 --> 28:30.684
- You were wrong.
- Oh, was I?

28:30.686 --> 28:31.868
Yes.

28:31.868 --> 28:33.687
I was the right person to write that story.

28:33.689 --> 28:35.923
Look, just tell me,
what did you think of it?

28:35.925 --> 28:37.224
It was good.

28:37.226 --> 28:38.401
It was great.

28:38.570 --> 28:39.827
One of your best.

28:39.829 --> 28:41.011
So, what's the problem?

28:41.013 --> 28:42.463
You undermining me...

28:42.465 --> 28:44.998
it sets the wrong tone for everyone else.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.500
David, you're undermining me.

28:47.064 --> 28:48.192
Excuse me?

28:48.274 --> 28:49.308
When I took this position,

28:49.308 --> 28:52.539
I was promised that I could write
the stories that matter to me...

28:52.541 --> 28:54.141
and run the paper my way.

28:54.143 --> 28:56.076
It seems we're at an impasse.

28:56.078 --> 28:58.045
I'm not.

28:58.047 --> 28:59.696
You are.

29:10.614 --> 29:12.747
She just took over my last responsibility.

29:12.748 --> 29:13.881
What was that?

29:13.883 --> 29:15.040
Games.

29:15.040 --> 29:16.650
I didn't think we were having any games?

29:16.652 --> 29:18.002
- Not anymore.
- Oh.

29:19.255 --> 29:20.487
Moon: Hey, ladies.

29:20.489 --> 29:21.605
How's that shower going?

29:21.607 --> 29:23.273
How do you know about the shower?

29:24.060 --> 29:25.042
Uh...

29:25.044 --> 29:26.460
Moon...

29:26.462 --> 29:28.178
I don't know anything...

29:28.180 --> 29:30.531
and Grace wasn't here, I swear.

29:30.533 --> 29:33.100
Oh, and here I am, lying to a judge.

29:33.102 --> 29:36.053
That's never a-a good idea, is it?

29:36.055 --> 29:38.272
Oh... someone's calling me.

29:39.659 --> 29:41.342
Mom...

29:41.344 --> 29:43.394
Can you believe her?

29:43.396 --> 29:45.279
Grace hates not knowing how
things are gonna turn out.

29:45.281 --> 29:46.830
Always has.

29:46.832 --> 29:48.015
When she was eight,

29:48.017 --> 29:49.483
she planned her own surprise party.

29:49.485 --> 29:50.868
Really?

29:51.821 --> 29:53.454
I can't picture her as a little kid.

29:53.456 --> 29:55.723
She was the same, just smaller.

29:55.725 --> 29:57.524
She's already pretty tiny.

29:57.526 --> 29:58.826
Tiny, but a force of nature.

29:58.828 --> 30:01.261
Mm-hmm.

30:01.263 --> 30:03.647
The party won't have anything
she hasn't already seen,

30:03.649 --> 30:04.698
and that's so wrong.

30:05.634 --> 30:06.934
Hmm...

30:08.104 --> 30:09.903
We'll see about that.

30:11.540 --> 30:13.407
Okay, so I'll make the deposit.

30:16.112 --> 30:17.244
Here.

30:17.246 --> 30:18.629
What's this?

30:18.631 --> 30:19.963
Well, have your lawyers look it over, Dad.

30:19.965 --> 30:21.181
It's my proposal for Charlotte's house.

30:21.183 --> 30:22.216
Really.

30:22.218 --> 30:23.784
Don't get too excited.

30:23.786 --> 30:24.968
You're not going to get
off cheap or anything,

30:24.970 --> 30:27.771
but I'm sure we can work out a deal.

30:27.773 --> 30:29.656
Hmm.

30:29.658 --> 30:31.258
Nice to see you come around, son.

30:32.011 --> 30:33.177
Dad.

30:34.997 --> 30:35.996
Wow.

30:36.916 --> 30:37.965
I don't believe it.

30:39.018 --> 30:40.734
What?

30:40.736 --> 30:42.619
You're finally going to end
this war with your father.

30:42.621 --> 30:43.837
What makes you say that?

30:43.839 --> 30:45.556
You're going to sell him the house.

30:45.558 --> 30:46.540
Who said?

30:46.542 --> 30:47.574
You just did.

30:47.576 --> 30:49.243
Oh, right, well, okay...

30:49.245 --> 30:51.178
it's obvious you're clearly a rookie, Alex.

30:51.180 --> 30:52.646
I have no intention

30:52.648 --> 30:54.448
of selling any of my
shares of Charlotte's house.

30:54.450 --> 30:55.682
You see, what I am going to do

30:55.684 --> 30:57.101
is make sure that Buck
thinks he's getting his way,

30:57.103 --> 30:59.319
and then when he lets
his guard down... Bam!

30:59.321 --> 31:00.320
That's when I'm going in for the kill.

31:00.322 --> 31:01.889
Warren, what do you want?

31:01.891 --> 31:04.258
What I want, Alex, is
control of my company back.

31:04.260 --> 31:05.526
Not to mention I'd like my father

31:05.528 --> 31:06.994
on the first boat out of Cedar Cove.

31:06.996 --> 31:08.562
And I want Charlotte's house.

31:08.564 --> 31:09.930
'Cause you see,

31:09.932 --> 31:12.599
I'm a simple man with simple desires.

31:14.970 --> 31:16.303
Unbelievable.

31:29.752 --> 31:30.634
Lisa!

31:30.636 --> 31:31.685
Judge Lockhart!

31:37.843 --> 31:39.643
Let me help you.

31:40.429 --> 31:42.379
But I don't need your help.

31:42.381 --> 31:43.680
You're making a mistake.

31:46.118 --> 31:47.668
I have to go.

31:52.324 --> 31:53.273
Hey.

31:53.275 --> 31:54.758
Hi.

31:54.760 --> 31:55.709
She looks familiar, no?

31:55.711 --> 31:56.710
Really?

31:56.712 --> 31:58.312
I guess not.

31:58.314 --> 32:00.113
You walking back to work?

32:00.115 --> 32:01.582
Yes,

32:01.584 --> 32:02.816
and I'm going to be
doing a lot more walking

32:02.818 --> 32:04.384
because Will wrecked my car.

32:04.386 --> 32:06.320
Ahh... Ouch.

32:06.322 --> 32:07.955
Yeah. It's classic Will.

32:07.957 --> 32:09.223
Did the same thing in high school,

32:09.225 --> 32:10.357
except that back then,

32:10.359 --> 32:12.893
he said a large dog hit the car.

32:12.895 --> 32:15.229
A dog hit your car? Was that dog Thor?

32:18.100 --> 32:19.800
Oh, that's great! Thank you.

32:19.802 --> 32:21.502
That's the best laugh I had all day.

32:21.504 --> 32:22.786
Good.

32:22.788 --> 32:23.720
So, what did you decide?

32:23.722 --> 32:24.805
Decide?

32:24.807 --> 32:25.689
About Alex?

32:25.691 --> 32:27.491
Oh, oh, the e-mail.

32:27.493 --> 32:29.710
Um... I haven't.

32:29.712 --> 32:31.728
Well, what are you waiting on?

32:31.730 --> 32:33.514
I don't think she's
waiting by her computer.

32:33.516 --> 32:35.782
Well, maybe she's not
sitting beside the computer,

32:35.784 --> 32:38.485
but she put herself out
there, and she took a chance.

32:38.487 --> 32:39.603
You seem to have a vested interest

32:39.605 --> 32:41.555
in me returning this e-mail.

32:41.557 --> 32:43.156
Well, you're avoiding her,
and that's not like you.

32:43.158 --> 32:44.658
Well, why do you care so much?

32:44.660 --> 32:45.926
Honestly?

32:45.928 --> 32:48.128
Yeah. I love honesty.

32:48.130 --> 32:50.831
Because I hate to see
you shut your heart off

32:50.833 --> 32:52.749
and spend the rest of your life alone

32:52.751 --> 32:55.135
just because you got hurt.

32:55.137 --> 32:57.321
And...

32:57.323 --> 32:59.907
you're my friend, and I care about you.

33:01.810 --> 33:03.277
That's nice... that you care.

33:03.279 --> 33:06.013
And the friend thing. That's nice.

33:07.182 --> 33:08.181
Oh, sorry.

33:10.586 --> 33:11.668
Hello.

33:11.670 --> 33:14.588
Yes, this is Olivia Lockhart.

33:15.391 --> 33:16.406
Excuse me,

33:16.408 --> 33:18.675
could you say that again, please?

33:24.500 --> 33:25.749
Will!

33:25.751 --> 33:27.150
Really?

33:27.152 --> 33:28.368
You didn't think I would find out?

33:28.370 --> 33:30.454
The people that you hit called me.

33:30.456 --> 33:31.421
They did?

33:31.423 --> 33:32.940
Surprised?

33:32.942 --> 33:34.324
Yeah... I left them my name and number.

33:34.326 --> 33:36.076
Left them?

33:36.078 --> 33:37.377
You told me you spoke to them.

33:37.379 --> 33:39.012
No, I said I left a note.

33:39.014 --> 33:40.914
No, you didn't.

33:40.916 --> 33:42.382
What did they say?

33:42.384 --> 33:44.952
They said that you left
the scene of the accident,

33:44.954 --> 33:47.654
and they tracked me
down by my license plate.

33:47.656 --> 33:48.956
There was no one in that car when I hit it.

33:48.958 --> 33:50.941
Not according to this woman.

33:50.943 --> 33:53.493
She and her husband were sitting in the car

33:53.495 --> 33:55.629
when you rear-ended
them in the parking lot.

33:55.631 --> 33:57.097
They are lying.

33:57.099 --> 33:58.565
Well, we're never going
to be able to prove it

33:58.567 --> 33:59.866
because you left the scene

33:59.868 --> 34:01.602
without filing a report with the police

34:01.604 --> 34:03.220
or the insurance company.

34:03.222 --> 34:03.887
What's the problem?

34:03.889 --> 34:05.322
It's my responsibility.

34:05.324 --> 34:06.440
I'll take care of it.

34:06.442 --> 34:08.275
But you didn't take care of it,

34:08.277 --> 34:09.842
and now I have to

34:09.844 --> 34:11.862
because they're coming after me.

34:51.971 --> 34:53.654
Hi.

34:53.656 --> 34:54.737
Hi.

34:58.193 --> 35:00.761
Okay, I just want to understand.

35:00.763 --> 35:01.995
Can you tell me why no kids?

35:01.997 --> 35:04.264
Because you would make such a good dad.

35:08.704 --> 35:10.837
The world isn't like Cedar Cove.

35:10.839 --> 35:13.140
This place is the exception,

35:13.142 --> 35:14.274
not the rule.

35:15.778 --> 35:17.160
Where is this coming from?

35:19.164 --> 35:21.415
I've seen some terrible things,

35:21.417 --> 35:22.683
and I don't want to bring another person

35:22.685 --> 35:24.084
into a world with wars.

35:27.523 --> 35:28.989
Right now...

35:28.991 --> 35:30.957
I think it's too soon for us

35:30.959 --> 35:33.593
to worry about whether
or not we have a family.

35:33.595 --> 35:35.595
Yeah, but the future that you want?

35:37.483 --> 35:39.266
I don't think I can give you that.

35:40.202 --> 35:42.335
I'm okay with that...

35:42.337 --> 35:43.670
for now.

35:45.441 --> 35:46.390
Why?

35:49.411 --> 35:51.611
Because I think I love you.

35:53.716 --> 35:58.151
♪ Why can't this love I
know comes from within... ♪

36:38.851 --> 36:40.061
Now for my gift.

36:40.201 --> 36:42.167
Oh, please tell me it's
not another waffle iron.

36:43.137 --> 36:44.353
It's not a waffle iron.

36:49.476 --> 36:51.126
Cliff is on a boat?

36:51.128 --> 36:53.128
He doesn't know how to drive a boat.

36:53.130 --> 36:54.596
He has a captain.

36:54.598 --> 36:56.381
And a romantic dinner for two,

36:56.383 --> 36:58.183
and the sunset is not optional.

36:58.185 --> 36:59.301
Oh...

37:00.287 --> 37:02.688
Grace, you planned your whole shower.

37:02.690 --> 37:04.990
I wanted to make sure
that you had a surprise.

37:04.992 --> 37:06.959
I am surprised.

37:08.078 --> 37:09.294
Are you happy?

37:09.296 --> 37:10.879
Yeah.

37:10.881 --> 37:11.880
I'm getting married!

37:13.934 --> 37:15.984
Hi, honey!

37:19.123 --> 37:20.122
Hi!

37:22.793 --> 37:24.710
Oh, thank you.

37:31.819 --> 37:33.785
What's this?

37:33.787 --> 37:35.954
One is my resignation.

37:35.956 --> 37:37.372
And the other?

37:37.374 --> 37:39.558
A story pitch.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.760
Working at this paper has been a gift,

37:41.762 --> 37:44.363
and I will spend every waking minute

37:44.365 --> 37:47.266
making sure that it
thrives under my leadership.

37:47.268 --> 37:49.668
I love what I do,

37:49.670 --> 37:51.420
and I am lucky to be able to do it,

37:51.422 --> 37:55.240
and I swear to you, I won't let you down.

37:55.242 --> 37:56.308
But?

37:56.310 --> 37:59.444
But...

37:59.446 --> 38:01.813
I have be able to write,

38:01.815 --> 38:04.616
and I decide who writes what.

38:04.618 --> 38:06.285
And if I say no?

38:06.287 --> 38:07.803
Then you'll be making a mistake.

38:07.805 --> 38:09.254
I have been waiting my entire career.

38:09.256 --> 38:10.889
For a break like this,

38:10.891 --> 38:13.892
and I'm not going to let
either one of us down.

38:14.745 --> 38:17.412
I'll surprise you. You'll see.

38:19.166 --> 38:20.165
So...

38:20.167 --> 38:21.366
what do you say?

38:21.368 --> 38:24.269
Which piece of paper do you want to see?

38:24.271 --> 38:27.589
My resignation, or my story?

38:30.344 --> 38:31.810
I don't give second chances.

38:31.812 --> 38:33.695
You won't have to.

38:44.625 --> 38:45.624
Thanks for coming.

38:47.177 --> 38:49.127
We need to talk.

38:49.129 --> 38:50.629
You need to leave my daughter alone.

38:50.631 --> 38:52.731
You've got her scared half to death.

38:52.733 --> 38:55.317
All I did was talk to her.

38:55.319 --> 38:56.768
If you don't back off,

38:56.770 --> 38:58.153
I'll get a protective order from the court

38:58.155 --> 38:59.688
to make sure you back off.

38:59.690 --> 39:01.440
Now, you should know,

39:01.442 --> 39:02.774
I'll stop at nothing to protect my family.

39:02.776 --> 39:05.744
Now, I am serious. Whoever you are...

39:05.746 --> 39:08.880
stay away from my daughter.

39:08.882 --> 39:10.415
'Cause if you push me,

39:10.417 --> 39:11.583
you're not gonna like what happens.

39:11.585 --> 39:12.834
I'm not afraid of you.

39:12.836 --> 39:15.554
If you leave Cedar Cove,

39:15.556 --> 39:17.255
whomever or whatever you're running from...

39:17.257 --> 39:18.890
I won't give it a second thought,

39:18.892 --> 39:20.559
but if you stay...

39:20.561 --> 39:21.677
Don't threaten me.

39:21.679 --> 39:24.846
You have no proof and no right, Roy Mcafee.

39:24.848 --> 39:27.816
I'd be less worried about me
and more worried about you.

39:27.818 --> 39:31.019
I know you, and I know what you did.

39:40.781 --> 39:42.447
Jack: I'm late.

39:42.449 --> 39:43.532
You called.

39:43.534 --> 39:44.533
And you texted!

39:44.535 --> 39:47.119
And you called again.

39:47.121 --> 39:48.286
I did.

39:50.174 --> 39:51.506
Aw...

39:51.508 --> 39:53.125
your article was beautiful.

39:53.127 --> 39:54.126
Aw.

39:54.128 --> 39:55.627
What did David think?

39:55.629 --> 39:57.095
The same.

39:57.097 --> 39:59.181
I can continue to write the stories I want,

39:59.183 --> 40:00.882
I can do the reporting I want...

40:00.884 --> 40:02.768
I just have to keep up
with everything else,

40:02.770 --> 40:05.771
which is going to...
keep me in Seattle more.

40:05.773 --> 40:07.222
Oh.

40:07.224 --> 40:09.725
Yeah.

40:09.727 --> 40:12.194
You know, we're just
getting to a good place,

40:12.196 --> 40:13.478
and now I have this job

40:13.480 --> 40:15.530
which is going to keep me away from here...

40:15.532 --> 40:16.531
and you...

40:16.533 --> 40:18.483
more than I'd like.

40:21.205 --> 40:22.320
I have a solution.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.239
Okay...

40:24.241 --> 40:26.825
Let's move in together.

40:29.129 --> 40:30.495
What?

40:30.497 --> 40:32.831
I've been thinking about it a lot, and...

40:32.833 --> 40:34.166
I really want to.

40:34.168 --> 40:35.917
What changed your mind?

40:38.722 --> 40:40.255
I love you.

40:41.558 --> 40:44.259
And I want us to have a fighting chance,

40:44.261 --> 40:48.513
and that means we have 
got to spend time together.

40:49.399 --> 40:50.682
You don't have to do this.

40:52.352 --> 40:54.686
I know I don't have to.

40:54.688 --> 40:56.321
I want to.

41:03.864 --> 41:06.281
So...

41:06.283 --> 41:07.582
Hmm.

41:07.584 --> 41:09.367
Your place or mine?

41:11.288 --> 41:12.337
Mine.

41:12.339 --> 41:13.705
Really?

41:13.707 --> 41:15.257
Jack... yeah.

41:15.259 --> 41:17.425

41:17.427 --> 41:18.877
but, you know,

41:18.879 --> 41:20.295
where am I going to put my big-screen TV?

41:20.297 --> 41:22.425
I mean, do you even have a sports package?

41:22.512 --> 41:24.627
Cable is very important to a man.

41:24.666 --> 41:25.624
I'm just saying that.
