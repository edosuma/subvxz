01:08.860 --> 01:12.660
<i>I knocked, I cried
She wouldn't open up</i>

01:16.577 --> 01:20.332
<i>So I put my little head
Down on the stone</i>

01:38.640 --> 01:42.361
<i>Head on stone
Feet on the threshold</i>

01:46.148 --> 01:49.698
<i>Open up, my love
For the fear of God</i>

02:07.961 --> 02:11.465
You're not afraid
it's too crude, too primitive?

02:12.174 --> 02:13.346
No, why?

02:13.425 --> 02:16.269
Where I come from
every drunk sings like this.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.155
<i>No, no, I won't marry a master</i>

02:34.279 --> 02:37.249
<i>I'll marry someone of my own ilk</i>

03:06.853 --> 03:09.732
<i>I won't go drinking with you
Because I'll only regret it</i>

03:25.455 --> 03:30.177
<i>Two hearts, four eyes</i>

03:32.879 --> 03:38.261
<i>Crying all day and all night</i>

03:41.012 --> 03:45.984
<i>Dark eyes, you cry because</i>

03:46.226 --> 03:51.107
<i>You can't be together</i>

04:11.793 --> 04:18.267
<i>Is this a God given love</i>

04:18.759 --> 04:23.811
<i>Or one whispered by the Devil?</i>

04:26.099 --> 04:27.601
This is beautiful.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.570
What language
are they singing in?

04:30.687 --> 04:31.939
Lemko.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.737
Thought so.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.488
Shame.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.497
Why?

04:42.949 --> 04:44.826
That it's not ours.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.751
Mr. Kaczmarek, whether it's ours
or not is none of your business.

06:34.185 --> 06:37.189
Young friends!
You may be wondering...

06:37.314 --> 06:40.318
What you're doing here,
in front of this stately home.

06:40.442 --> 06:43.491
Well, this is now your home.

06:43.862 --> 06:48.333
Through this door you will enter
a world of music, song and dance.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.710
Music, born in the fields.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.377
The music of your grandparents,
and their grandparents.

06:54.623 --> 06:57.752
The music of pain and humiliation.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.470
Of joy too, even if through tears.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.971
You may also be wondering, will everyone
be allowed through this door?

07:05.133 --> 07:08.103
And my answer is: absolutely not.

07:08.219 --> 07:11.268
Only the best of the best
will make it.

07:11.348 --> 07:14.397
And then, under the careful
supervision of our tutors,

07:14.517 --> 07:19.239
you will step onto our nation's stages,
and the stages of our brotherly nations.

07:19.356 --> 07:22.235
So I invite you to join
the fierce and noble struggle

07:22.359 --> 07:24.202
with yourselves
and with each other.

07:24.361 --> 07:28.491
No more will the talents
of the People go to waste. Hurrah!

07:52.097 --> 07:54.395
Do we have to be able
to read music?

07:54.557 --> 07:56.355
They want it peasant-style.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.241
And you? What will you sing?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.111
A mountain tune.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.573
And you?

08:11.408 --> 08:12.876
Don't know yet.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.538
How does it go,
this tune of yours?

08:29.217 --> 08:30.844
Nice, I know it.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.269
It would be nice with two voices.

08:36.683 --> 08:41.359
<i>I'm over the water
And you're over the water</i>

08:41.479 --> 08:46.030
<i>How are we going
To get together</i>

08:59.914 --> 09:01.461
Thank you.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.089
Excuse me, miss with the fringe...

09:04.627 --> 09:06.880
What else have you got?

09:07.422 --> 09:09.299
- To sing?
- Yes.

09:16.598 --> 09:21.069
<i>How many sweet, good girls</i>

09:21.436 --> 09:25.157
<i>With pretty names</i>

09:25.440 --> 09:28.865
<i>But only one of them suffers</i>

09:28.985 --> 09:32.910
<i>There's no sleep when you're in love.</i>

09:33.031 --> 09:34.954
- Thank you.
- And the chorus.

09:35.033 --> 09:41.086
<i>Heart, you don't care for peace</i>

09:41.623 --> 09:46.675
<i>Heart, it's great to be alive</i>

09:47.295 --> 09:52.472
<i>Heart, it's so good you're like this</i>

09:53.676 --> 09:57.351
<i>Thank you, Heart, for knowing</i>

09:57.514 --> 10:00.563
<i>How to love like this</i>

10:00.850 --> 10:03.820
- Where did you get that song?
- The movies.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.362
A travelling cinema showed
a Russian musical in our village.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.325
That's where it's from.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.867
- And what is it about?
- Love, of course! "Heart."

10:14.155 --> 10:15.657
How's your dancing?

10:15.782 --> 10:18.410
I know the basic moves.
The rest I can learn.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.378
That's wonderful. Thank you.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.754
Thank you.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.506
The other one
had a beautiful, pure voice.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.468
- But this one also has something...
- What?

10:30.588 --> 10:33.967
Energy. Spirit.
She's original.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.220
As you like.

10:43.268 --> 10:46.738
We should get a dozen dancers
together from that bunch.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.697
You see your girl?

10:53.862 --> 10:55.159
Which girl?

10:56.030 --> 10:57.873
The "Heart" one.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.660
She is up to something.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.843
Quite a number.

11:10.795 --> 11:14.550
She's not from the mountains,
but from Tomaszéw. Bit of a con.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.848
- But she sings well.
- And she did time, too.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.220
What?

11:19.345 --> 11:21.598
Apparently she killed her father.

11:22.140 --> 11:25.189
Apparently. And she still has
a suspended sentence.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.736
How do you know?

11:30.857 --> 11:32.700
Kaczmarek checked her out.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.794
Head, Zula...

12:21.407 --> 12:23.785
WE WELCOME TOMORROW.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.830
Now fix it there.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.798
Fuck.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.691
So what's the story with the father?

12:47.725 --> 12:50.274
- Whose father?
- Yours.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.522
What do you mean?

12:53.231 --> 12:54.904
What did you do time for?

12:57.068 --> 13:01.574
He mistook me for my mother so I used
a knife to show him the difference.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.951
He didn't die, don't worry.

13:11.416 --> 13:15.421
Are you interested in me
because of my talent? Or just in general?

13:18.840 --> 13:20.183
Try this.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.678
Not bad.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.956
Leg higher!

15:15.623 --> 15:17.000
Good.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.935
Beautiful, Mateusz, bravo!

15:35.977 --> 15:37.570
Keep to the tempo!

15:43.484 --> 15:45.031
Look at each other!

15:46.696 --> 15:50.291
One two three, one two three,
hook and... turn!

16:28.279 --> 16:32.625
<i>Two hearts, four eyes</i>

16:37.914 --> 16:42.761
<i>Crying all day and all night</i>

16:49.383 --> 16:54.139
<i>Dark eyes, you cry because</i>

16:54.263 --> 16:59.941
<i>You cannot be together</i>

17:21.249 --> 17:25.503
<i>My mother forbade me</i>

17:31.133 --> 17:35.559
<i>From loving this lad</i>

17:42.186 --> 17:48.319
<i>A heart would have to be
Made of stone</i>

17:48.442 --> 17:52.993
<i>Not to love that boy</i>

18:37.867 --> 18:40.461
I've had enough of this.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.124
Let's go.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.962
- Wait a bit. Let's enjoy this.
- Let them have their fun.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.219
We can have our own.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.977
I have to tell you something.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.519
I never believed
in all this folky stuff.

19:05.895 --> 19:09.274
But this... it moved me.
You are a genius.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.944
To take something so...
And make it so beautiful...

19:14.445 --> 19:15.947
Thank you both.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.826
This is the most beautiful
day of my life.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.105
In your repertoire you access
priceless treasures

20:23.222 --> 20:26.271
of our People's culture.
This is highly commendable.

20:27.184 --> 20:32.031
We want you to become
a living calling card for our Fatherland.

20:33.149 --> 20:37.495
But I think it's time to add
something new to your repertoire.

20:37.611 --> 20:42.492
About Land Reform,
World Peace and the threats to it.

20:43.743 --> 20:47.964
A strong number about
the Leader of the World Proletariat.

20:48.622 --> 20:53.128
And we, in turn, will do everything
in our power to show our gratitude.

20:54.545 --> 20:59.392
And then, who knows...
Berlin, Prague, Budapest, Moscow.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.594
What do you think?

21:05.139 --> 21:08.063
I would like to express gratitude
on behalf of the whole ensemble

21:08.184 --> 21:10.482
for your appreciation
of our hard work.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.732
But when it comes to our repertoire,
it's based on authentic folk art.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.817
The rural population
doesn't sing about

21:15.941 --> 21:18.820
Land Reform,
Peace and Leaders.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.539
Simply doesn't do it,
so it would be difficult.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.287
I understand.

21:25.284 --> 21:30.381
If I may... Kaczmarek Lech,
Administrative Manager.

21:30.498 --> 21:34.469
Comrade Bielecka,
I assure you that our nation

21:34.585 --> 21:37.589
is not so ignorant,
including its rural elements.

21:37.713 --> 21:41.763
Quite the contrary.
And it will sing about those issues.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.395
As long as it is encouraged...

21:45.179 --> 21:48.524
and given direction.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.319
This, I believe, is exactly
what the role of our ensemble should be.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.406
Thank you.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.414
Thank you.

22:32.726 --> 22:37.607
<i>...of the wise, beloved by all</i>

22:37.815 --> 22:42.787
<i>Wonderful Stalin</i>

22:43.237 --> 22:48.459
<i>Most beautiful songs
Of our age are sung</i>

23:25.529 --> 23:27.406
We swear to you, Fatherland...

23:27.531 --> 23:32.253
On the testament of the great
patriots and revolutionaries...

23:36.498 --> 23:39.547
Feliks Dzieriyfiski
and Karol Swierczewski...

23:39.919 --> 23:41.671
We're going to Berlin.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.926
To the International
Festival of Youth in December.

23:50.095 --> 23:53.690
Berlin today, Moscow tomorrow,
and then... God knows where.

24:00.648 --> 24:03.447
Shouldn't we do something
about Janicka?

24:04.777 --> 24:07.656
- What about her?
- She's too dark.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.915
We need a folk appearance.
A pure Polish, Slav look.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.170
Just look at her eyes.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.847
How do you know about Berlin?

24:25.798 --> 24:27.675
From the Minister.

24:33.889 --> 24:37.314
Maybe I exaggerate.
We could dye her hair.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.672
I'll be with you
till the end of the world.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.678
But I have to tell you something.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.403
I am ratting on you.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.864
What do you mean "ratting"?

25:32.948 --> 25:35.952
I go to Kaczmarek
every week and "confess."

25:40.539 --> 25:43.759
But I never tell anything
that could hurt you.

25:45.836 --> 25:48.715
The worst part is,
he's hitting on me.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.264
What does he want to know?

25:52.384 --> 25:56.480
Things... What you did during the war.
If you listen to Radio Liberty.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.807
If you have dollars.
If you believe in God.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.477
Do you?

26:02.061 --> 26:03.278
I do.

26:08.233 --> 26:11.032
I knew it!
Fuck, I'm an idiot.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.909
What would you do in my place?
I'm on probation.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.455
They wouldn't have let me in otherwise!

26:19.161 --> 26:20.378
Wiktor!

26:22.706 --> 26:26.756
Go and fuck yourself, bourgeois wanker!
Whatever!

26:28.962 --> 26:31.966
If I wanted, I could fuck you up
good and proper!

28:07.811 --> 28:10.781
As you all know,
these days Berlin is the front line

28:10.898 --> 28:14.323
between the socialist
and the imperialist camp.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.993
Between the forces
of Peace and the Revanchists.

28:18.488 --> 28:23.164
And on the front line, as is the way
with front lines, anything can happen.

28:23.327 --> 28:28.879
So we must stick together, be vigilant
and responsible for one another.

28:29.041 --> 28:34.719
And whatever they say,
Germans are still Germans.

28:35.047 --> 28:39.928
So here's to the adventure
of a lifetime.

28:47.309 --> 28:48.606
Excuse me.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.057
400 metres means
ten minutes walk from the theatre.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.644
This is where the Russian sector ends.
I'll wait here.

29:44.783 --> 29:48.413
As you all know,
these days Berlin is the front line

29:51.415 --> 29:54.715
You'll be with me.
We'll be together.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.421
I can't speak French, or anything.

29:57.587 --> 30:01.467
You'll learn.
You have an ear, you have talent.

30:02.551 --> 30:03.928
You're unique.

30:04.845 --> 30:07.098
I don't want to live without you.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.778
Alright then, let's do it.

31:47.030 --> 31:50.159
What's the matter with you?
There's a banquet.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.794
The comrades want to meet you.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.539
Let me fix my hair.
I'll be down soon.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.260
You look great by the way.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.388
Get a move on.

32:43.879 --> 32:49.886
Poland and German Democratic
Republic are good friends.

32:52.846 --> 32:55.975
We have to establish
communist friendship.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.278
We are brothers and sisters.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.403
How's the food?

33:08.028 --> 33:11.908
Made here, on the premises.
Our specialty.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.785
Thank you, it's truly excellent.

33:14.868 --> 33:16.870
Fish fresh from the Baltic.

36:25.975 --> 36:30.025
- Another one, please.
- Sorry, sir. We have to close now.

36:30.313 --> 36:34.318
You could go to "Chez Mariette",
they stay open till one.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.160
But between you and me,

36:36.277 --> 36:39.247
if she hasn't turned up by now
she never will.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.061
How long are you in Paris?

37:06.725 --> 37:08.978
We're leaving tomorrow morning.

37:10.437 --> 37:11.905
How is life here?

37:14.607 --> 37:15.950
I get by...

37:16.401 --> 37:19.826
arranging and composing.
I play at a club.

37:21.865 --> 37:23.117
It's good.

37:26.619 --> 37:28.087
Are you with someone?

37:28.955 --> 37:29.956
Yes.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.083
Me too.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.055
So are you happy?

37:47.682 --> 37:51.482
- I'll walk you to the hotel.
- Better not, you know how it is.

37:51.644 --> 37:52.896
For a bit.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.281
No one will see us.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.915
So can you tell me
why you never came?

38:10.413 --> 38:11.835
I felt it wouldn't work.

38:15.251 --> 38:17.128
Not the actual escape...

38:18.505 --> 38:21.850
But I wasn't up to it,
wasn't good enough.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.343
Not good enough?

38:24.135 --> 38:25.682
Not as good as you...

38:26.262 --> 38:27.605
and in general.

38:28.890 --> 38:31.439
- You know what I mean.
- I don't.

38:31.601 --> 38:33.945
I know that love is love
and that's that.

38:34.103 --> 38:37.778
And I know one thing.
I wouldn't have escaped without you.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.111
That's far enough.

39:56.019 --> 39:57.896
Have you been whoring?

40:00.440 --> 40:02.613
I don't have money for whores.

40:04.694 --> 40:06.367
I was with the woman of my life.

40:07.947 --> 40:09.369
That's wonderful.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.827
Let me go to sleep then.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.447
Looks good, doesn't it?

41:27.735 --> 41:29.237
Welcome.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.743
- Do you have a ticket?
- Yes.

41:31.864 --> 41:34.617
I'd be very interested
to hear your thoughts.

41:34.909 --> 41:39.039
We've got quite a few new numbers,
even one in Yugoslav.

41:39.956 --> 41:41.754
A nod to our hosts.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.459
Nice.

41:44.210 --> 41:47.259
It's got more style now, more zing.

41:48.047 --> 41:51.642
It's a pity you had to leave us.
You had talent.

41:52.552 --> 41:54.680
Would you like to sit
in our VIP box?

41:54.804 --> 41:57.057
Thank you,
but I have a very good seat.

41:57.223 --> 41:58.520
Well, well...

41:59.058 --> 42:00.526
See you then.

42:06.649 --> 42:11.155
<i>Silken thread, Serbian cut</i>

42:14.198 --> 42:18.453
<i>A tiny string, a fine thread</i>

42:21.622 --> 42:24.546
<i>I am your, Milan, darling</i>

42:29.130 --> 42:33.977
<i>My caresses from the Morava</i>

42:36.637 --> 42:39.732
<i>An embroidered shirt</i>

42:40.475 --> 42:44.150
<i>And I am promised to Milan</i>

42:45.938 --> 42:51.445
<i>I'm sewing a silken thread from dreams</i>

44:27.874 --> 44:29.751
Where are you taking me?

44:30.459 --> 44:31.756
To Moscow.

44:33.171 --> 44:36.175
But I'm here legally. I have a visa.

44:36.632 --> 44:40.057
I'm a resident in France.
I'm not a Polish citizen anymore!

44:40.178 --> 44:41.430
Yes, we know.

44:42.972 --> 44:45.316
Relax, you're not going to Moscow

44:46.684 --> 44:51.315
You going to Zagreb
and then Paris or wherever.

44:53.482 --> 44:55.860
The Poles wanted us
to send you to Warsaw,

44:55.985 --> 44:58.329
which wouldn't be
good for you, right?

45:12.335 --> 45:15.714
- Let me stay just one night.
- The train is waiting.

45:15.796 --> 45:20.927
It's about a woman,
the love of my life.

45:21.469 --> 45:24.188
So you wanna go back
to Warsaw with her?

45:24.305 --> 45:25.978
Femme fatale, eh?

45:29.060 --> 45:31.813
They say Warsaw
is the Paris of the East.

45:36.067 --> 45:38.946
<i>Mother forbade me...</i>

45:44.784 --> 45:49.665
<i>From loving the lad...</i>

47:19.587 --> 47:21.180
The piano doesn't sound right here.

47:21.380 --> 47:24.054
Let's drop it and use it
for the actual murder.

47:24.175 --> 47:28.646
The strings come in a bit early.
Let's wait until the shadow appears.

47:29.180 --> 47:30.352
Fine.

48:05.841 --> 48:07.434
So you're married?

48:08.219 --> 48:09.345
Yes.

48:10.805 --> 48:12.102
I did it for us.

48:14.183 --> 48:17.312
But it wasn't a church wedding,
so it doesn't count.

48:18.646 --> 48:21.445
- So what's your name now?
- Gangarossa-Lichofi.

48:21.565 --> 48:25.286
- Ganga... what?
- Gangarossa, Sicilian name.

48:26.904 --> 48:29.327
The main thing is you're not married.

48:29.782 --> 48:32.080
- Or are you?
- Come on...

48:39.625 --> 48:41.502
I've been waiting for you.

51:09.400 --> 51:13.121
<i>Two hearts, four eyes...</i>

51:18.534 --> 51:22.630
<i>Crying all day and all night...</i>

51:27.918 --> 51:32.219
<i>Dark eyes, you cry</i>

51:32.506 --> 51:35.851
<i>You cannot be together</i>

52:55.422 --> 52:57.720
It's too many "r's" in a row.

52:57.925 --> 52:58.972
No.

53:08.936 --> 53:10.904
And it doesn't fit the music.

53:12.731 --> 53:15.405
It fits, when you
pronounce it properly.

53:17.403 --> 53:20.202
But what does it have
to do with "Hearts"?

53:22.074 --> 53:23.951
It's a free translation.

53:24.868 --> 53:26.791
I wonder who translated it?

53:26.912 --> 53:28.539
Don't tell me it was
that poetess of yours.

53:30.541 --> 53:31.918
Yes, so what?

53:33.043 --> 53:35.341
Juliette did it as a favour, for free.

53:35.462 --> 53:36.805
I should hope so.

53:37.715 --> 53:39.308
Bit silly if you ask me.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.598
"The Pendulum killed time."

53:42.928 --> 53:44.054
Oh, my God.

53:45.097 --> 53:48.943
What a critic!
Juliette is a very well known poet.

53:49.476 --> 53:53.106
- They just brought out her anthology.
- I won't be singing that.

53:53.230 --> 53:56.609
- Then there will be no record.
- Then there won't be.

54:31.477 --> 54:34.071
Be nice to Michel, he can be helpful.

54:34.772 --> 54:38.072
We like each other
and he'll like you even more.

54:38.150 --> 54:40.869
- Why?
- Because you're charming.

54:40.944 --> 54:43.197
You've got
"charme slave" as they say.

54:43.322 --> 54:45.074
But go easy on the make up.

54:45.199 --> 54:47.748
- Why?
- You look good already.

54:49.369 --> 54:51.212
Be yourself, relax.

55:00.255 --> 55:02.428
- Tie or no tie?
- Tie.

55:10.265 --> 55:13.565
- Who are the guests?
- Various interesting people.

55:13.685 --> 55:16.564
- Your famous poetess as well?
- Probably yes.

55:16.647 --> 55:18.149
She's no threat.

55:18.649 --> 55:20.822
She's already had two lovers since me.

55:20.943 --> 55:23.571
And with Michel, just play it by ear.

55:25.197 --> 55:26.824
Good evening.

55:34.957 --> 55:37.585
- Wiktor!
- This is Michel.

55:37.709 --> 55:40.633
- How are you?
- This is Michel and this is Zula.

55:42.047 --> 55:43.924
I'm delighted to meet you.

55:44.049 --> 55:45.847
I've heard a lot about you.

55:45.926 --> 55:47.018
Thank you.

55:48.095 --> 55:51.975
- How did the film go down?
- Very good. We're pleased.

55:52.099 --> 55:55.228
- Which is good news for you too.
- I'm glad.

55:55.352 --> 55:57.901
You converse away, I'll look around.

55:59.439 --> 56:00.941
She's got something.

56:28.468 --> 56:29.640
Good evening.

56:30.762 --> 56:32.810
Excuse me.
Good evening.

56:32.931 --> 56:35.184
I thought a lot about your lyrics.

56:35.350 --> 56:37.023
Really? What lyrics?

56:37.227 --> 56:39.650
- To my song.
- I see...

56:40.063 --> 56:42.111
"The pendulum has killed time."

56:42.232 --> 56:44.075
Nice, but I don't get it.

56:44.151 --> 56:46.529
You don't? It's a metaphor.

56:47.070 --> 56:48.367
To mean what?

56:49.948 --> 56:52.747
That time doesn't matter
when you're in love.

56:59.625 --> 57:01.218
Do you like it here?

57:01.877 --> 57:03.971
Paris? It's fine.

57:05.422 --> 57:08.050
It must have been a shock.

57:08.550 --> 57:10.097
A shock? Why?

57:10.385 --> 57:14.481
Cinemas, cafes, restaurants, shops.
As far as I know...

57:15.515 --> 57:18.189
Between you and me
my life was better in Poland.

57:18.685 --> 57:20.483
So why did you run away?

57:20.604 --> 57:22.072
I didn't run away.

57:22.230 --> 57:24.779
I married an Italian and left legally.

57:27.069 --> 57:29.071
Ever been to Palermo?

57:29.696 --> 57:30.788
No.

57:32.074 --> 57:33.326
That's a shame.

57:35.869 --> 57:37.291
Nice meeting you.

57:54.638 --> 57:55.981
Excuse me.

57:57.140 --> 58:00.144
- What the fuck did you tell him?
- What do you mean?

58:00.936 --> 58:02.938
That I pretended to
be a village girl...

58:03.105 --> 58:05.699
That I ratted on you.
That I killed my father.

58:07.109 --> 58:08.952
That I danced
for Stalin at the Kremlin.

58:09.152 --> 58:10.995
- That was a nice touch.
- Really, why?

58:11.071 --> 58:13.950
- I wanted to give you more colour.
- More colour?!

58:15.075 --> 58:16.873
Yes, that's how it works here.

58:16.952 --> 58:18.044
How?

58:18.954 --> 58:20.046
I don't know.

58:20.163 --> 58:22.666
Edith Piaf for instance
worked in a brothel

58:22.791 --> 58:24.964
and they love her all
the more for it.

58:25.085 --> 58:27.634
A brothel! What the hell
are you doing to me?

58:27.754 --> 58:31.429
And Giovanni wasn't a Duke,
he traded in cut glass.

58:31.800 --> 58:35.270
Christ, all right, I won't do it again.
Shall we go home?

58:37.014 --> 58:38.812
I met your lover.

58:40.017 --> 58:43.021
Nice.
A pretty back, but...

58:43.145 --> 58:46.365
A bit on the old side.
You look good together.

58:55.365 --> 58:56.537
"Métaph0re..."

58:57.576 --> 58:58.793
Idiot.

59:07.461 --> 59:08.804
What a jerk.

59:10.964 --> 59:12.090
Oh, well...

59:16.928 --> 59:18.521
Don't you worry, Zula.

59:19.806 --> 59:21.308
What will be will be.

59:25.604 --> 59:27.481
I love him and that's that.

59:31.568 --> 59:32.990
Zula, what's up?

59:41.495 --> 59:42.963
What are you doing?

59:43.330 --> 59:45.253
Come in here. I'm a bit sad.

59:45.415 --> 59:47.964
Not now, love, we're off to "Eclipse."

59:48.752 --> 59:50.345
Everyone's leaving.

59:50.962 --> 59:52.509
Ok, give me a moment.

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:54.970
In Poland you were a man.
You're different here.

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:08.521
Maybe I just imagined things.

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:20.449
But everything is wonderful.
We are in Paris.

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:22.789
I love you with all my heart.

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:28.504
And don't worry about Michel,
we get on like a house on fire.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.210
I'll take care of everything.

01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:21.055
<i>Stop!</i>

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.426
What?

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.977
That's blank.

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:29.556
Blank?

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:35.771
We have forty minutes left.
Don't blow it, please.

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:46.911
Fine. I'll do it right.
You'll get what you want.

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:49.750
Me?

01:03:52.037 --> 01:03:54.335
Everything here is for you.

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:59.552
- Believe in yourself.
- I do. It's you I don't believe in.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:04.890
Shall we?

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:07.598
Let's go again.

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:32.224
Why so sad?

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:36.145
Look.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:37.855
Our first child.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.732
A bastard.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:45.033
What's wrong?

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:47.576
Nothing really.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:50.822
Everything is great.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:54.292
The French know
what they're doing.

01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:59.131
And Michel is a real master.
He fucked me six times in one night.

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:02.629
Not like a Polish artist in exile.

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:09.720
Now we're talking.

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:59.816
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't do anything. She left.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.393
For Poland.

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:04.654
Poland?

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.412
Is this Mazurek?

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:42.872
<i>Mazurek, 'm Bmkaczéw.</i>

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:45.913
0418.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.169
Zuzanna Lichofi, please.

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:53.675
Lichor'1.

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:55.969
Zula.

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:01.888
She's just got back.

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:06.395
I see.

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:09.983
You don't know where she is?

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:41.345
Honestly, I don't know
how to help you.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:45.978
You're not French,
and you're not a Pole either.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:49.736
As far as we're concerned,
you don't exist.

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:53.861
But between you and me...

01:09:54.482 --> 01:09:57.201
Why on earth
would you want to leave this place?

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:58.695
I'm Polish.

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:02.199
- Please, stop it.
- I am.

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:07.830
You ran away. You betrayed us.
You letdown young people who trusted you.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:10.423
You don't love Poland.

01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:12.675
- I do.
- No, you don't.

01:10:20.842 --> 01:10:22.685
But there is a solution.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:28.733
If you truly regret your deeds.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:34.902
You have a certain position
in artistic circles here.

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:39.865
You know all kinds of emigres.

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:49.931
Good day.

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:16.461
You look terrible.

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:25.053
How many years?

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:28.265
Fifteen.

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:34.150
Apparently I'm lucky.

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:37.362
Illegal border crossing
in both directions

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:40.190
and it turns out
I spied for the British.

01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:59.174
You've got ten minutes.

01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:22.444
What have we done?

01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:35.748
I'll wait for you.

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:37.295
Don't.

01:13:37.455 --> 01:13:41.085
Find some normal guy.
One who'll put up with you.

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:45.838
That sort hasn't been born yet.

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:56.474
I'll get you out of here.

01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:57.960
It's nice of you to find time.

01:14:58.077 --> 01:14:59.624
Don't be sad, Piotrué.

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:01.622
Come, introduce yourself.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:04.049
That's Piotrué.

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:05.881
Hello.

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:09.759
He's shy.

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:14.347
Do we look alike?

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:16.224
A spitting image.

01:15:17.763 --> 01:15:20.642
So? You're going back to music?

01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:23.269
Not really.

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:29.826
I'm glad we were able to get you
out of there. It wasn't easy.

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:33.287
But the deputy minister
is our neighbor and a good friend.

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:36.036
Thank you. I'm really grateful.

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:44.048
I've listened to your Parisian record.
It's really good.

01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:46.008
Wonderful arrangements.

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:51.263
It would be good to record
it again here. In Polish.

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:54.808
Zula could use that.
And so could you.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:15:59.976
Here comes Mummy.

01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:18.119
Love you to bits,
but I need to throw up.

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:22.203
Stay for the reception.

01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:25.039
There will be many interesting people.

01:16:26.457 --> 01:16:28.334
Come, it's all right.

01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:46.898
Get me out of here.

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:49.814
That's why I'm here.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:52.358
I mean for good.

01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:01.362
Repeat after me.

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:07.085
I, Wiktor Warski, take you,
Zuzanna Lichofi, to be my wife

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:15.134
And I swear to be with you
always, until death do us part.

01:19:20.381 --> 01:19:23.681
I, Zuzanna Lichofi, take you,
Wiktor Warski, to be my husband.

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:27.263
And I swear to be with you
always until death do us part.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.648
So help us God.

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:42.953
More for you. You're heavier.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.292
Now I'm yours.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.967
For ever and ever.

01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:44.385
Let's go to the other side.

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:49.678
The view will be better there.
