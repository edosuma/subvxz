[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:03.546 --> 00:06.458
There's a rental car parked out front.
Go to Sioux City.

00:06.549 --> 00:09.256
I want you to check in
at the Sage Flower Motel.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.504
Wait for me.
I'll be there in the am.

00:11.596 --> 00:14.008
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

00:14.098 --> 00:16.089
Go. Go.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.101
I don't care what Jack said.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.605
They've got him.
We have to get him back. I owe him.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.778
[Sayid] Circumstances have changed.
He may not want to be rescued.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.356
If he's shaking hands with The Others,
he has a reason.

00:33.451 --> 00:35.487
[Kate] We came to rescue Jack.

00:35.578 --> 00:37.864
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

00:37.955 --> 00:39.991
- I came to get you.
- Get out of here.

00:40.082 --> 00:42.494
- Get down! Get her down!
- Don't hurt her!

00:43.711 --> 00:46.703
I made a deal with them.
They're gonna let me go.

00:47.298 --> 00:49.414
- Where?
- Home.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.543
Jack, we need to go.

00:55.765 --> 00:58.472
[Pryce] Hey! Hold it right there!
Get your hands up!

00:58.684 --> 01:01.061
Get down! I said, get down!

01:01.812 --> 01:04.224
- What are you doing here, John?
- Sorry, Jack.

01:04.315 --> 01:05.475
Sorry for what?

01:27.964 --> 01:29.955
[footsteps]

01:37.306 --> 01:40.173
- [deadbolts unlocking]
- [keys jingling]

01:46.983 --> 01:48.974
[grunts, groaning]

01:55.950 --> 01:58.487
l was just bringing you
something to eat.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.453
Enjoy your sandwich.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.874
[coughing]

02:08.462 --> 02:11.454
[country music on radio]

02:21.475 --> 02:23.181
Been on the road awhile?

02:23.269 --> 02:24.725
How long's it gonna take?

02:24.812 --> 02:26.518
Well, your fan belt's shot.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.687
It'll take two days, maybe three.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.149
- Three days for a fan belt?
- [man chuckles]

02:32.236 --> 02:33.851
Welcome to Iowa.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.907
- Name's Johnny.
- l'm Lucy.

02:52.089 --> 02:56.549
[woman] They're all 18 karat gold.
Typically they retail for 500 bucks.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.217
[man] Come on, those don't look real.
I'm not buying.

02:59.305 --> 03:01.796
...going out of business.
You'll never find...

03:01.891 --> 03:04.132
If you need a lift,
I'm finished in an hour.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.353
What con are you pulling?
I'll call the cops!

03:06.437 --> 03:08.678
- Your loss.
- Hey, there a problem, buddy?

03:08.773 --> 03:12.607
Yeah, there's a problem.
I'm getting scammed, that's the problem.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.854
- I'm sorry.
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.776
Hey, you don't have to buy them.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.856
Those are fake necklaces
and you're a rip-off artist.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.815
- They're real.
- Call the cops.

03:22.745 --> 03:25.782
- l'll sell them to somebody else.
- Hey, let me see those.

03:27.750 --> 03:31.993
My father owns a jewelry store.
I think I can spot a fake. How much?

03:33.381 --> 03:35.963
- Sixty bucks.
- I'll take the one on the end.

03:38.469 --> 03:39.879
Whatever.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.842
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

03:47.937 --> 03:49.928
Can I get my money back?

03:54.235 --> 03:55.315
Hey!

03:58.656 --> 03:59.987
Why'd you help me?

04:00.825 --> 04:04.033
Just one girl watching
another girl's back, I guess.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.076
Or you're stranded here

04:06.163 --> 04:09.701
and for some reason you didn't want
that guy calling the cops.

04:18.467 --> 04:21.755
I'll give you a ride into town,
you buy me a drink.

04:29.687 --> 04:31.143
[door opens]

04:32.857 --> 04:34.017
What?

04:36.193 --> 04:37.308
Kate...

04:39.113 --> 04:41.399
John? What are you doing?

04:43.367 --> 04:48.612
- Did they capture you?
- Yes. But only temporarily.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.532
I came to say goodbye.

04:54.712 --> 04:57.294
- Goodbye?
- I'm leaving with them.

04:57.381 --> 05:00.123
What the hell is going on?
What are they doing to you?

05:00.217 --> 05:02.629
Are you brainwashed?
Where did Jack go?

05:02.720 --> 05:04.756
Jack didn't go anywhere, Kate.

05:04.847 --> 05:07.384
He's gonna have to stay behind like you.

05:08.184 --> 05:09.219
You can't trust them.

05:09.310 --> 05:12.222
If they told you they're gonna
take you home, they're lying.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.645
I don't want to go home, Kate.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.978
I want you to know
I made a strong case for you.

05:19.069 --> 05:23.984
I told them that you were a good person.
Reliable. Smart. Honest.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.986
And then they told me who you were
and what you had done.

05:28.913 --> 05:32.246
Let's just say forgiveness
isn't one of their strong suits.

05:36.629 --> 05:38.244
Good luck.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.996
- Where are you going?
- Coming out.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.673
Hey... Just...

05:43.761 --> 05:47.253
Where's Jack and where's Sayid?
Have you seen Rousseau?

05:52.770 --> 05:55.011
John, please, what's happened to you?

05:55.105 --> 05:56.356
I'm sorry, Kate.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.050
What's wrong with you?

06:31.141 --> 06:34.304
Don't look at me,
and pretend we're not talking.

06:34.395 --> 06:37.683
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- Good, then scram.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.685
Dude, you need to know
that there's been some chatter.

06:40.776 --> 06:43.108
After Paulo and Nikki and everything...

06:43.195 --> 06:47.234
- Tomorrow there's gonna be a vote.
- A vote for what?

06:47.324 --> 06:49.485
To decide whether or not to banish you.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.734
Banish me?

06:52.788 --> 06:54.904
- Where?
- There was a debate about that.

06:54.999 --> 06:58.241
But the consensus was
half a mile down the beach.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.871
"Consensus"?

06:59.962 --> 07:03.420
I'm only saying this
because there may be a way to fix it,

07:03.507 --> 07:06.169
to, like, make amends.

07:07.845 --> 07:11.087
- I don't do amends.
- You might wanna ask yourself

07:11.181 --> 07:14.765
about all the good stuff that comes
from being a part of this society.

07:16.604 --> 07:19.846
I mean, you can't even feed yourself.
You use our latrine,

07:19.940 --> 07:23.432
drink the water Steve brings
every morning to the trough.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.642
What?

07:24.737 --> 07:28.446
You know how for three days,
ten hours, and 15 minutes

07:28.532 --> 07:31.023
- I ain't allowed to use nicknames?
- Yeah?

07:31.118 --> 07:33.951
Well, you, sir... Hugo...

07:35.289 --> 07:39.749
...are rotund, annoying,
and you're ruining my damn view.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.543
How's that for amends?

07:42.630 --> 07:45.042
You're making a big mistake, dude.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.292
Banish me. [scoffs]

07:52.514 --> 07:54.505
[buzzing]

08:10.908 --> 08:12.569
[door closes]

08:14.912 --> 08:17.745
[people clamoring]

08:36.392 --> 08:38.724
[hissing]

09:10.467 --> 09:13.209
— [country music playing]
- [pinball bells ringing]

09:17.558 --> 09:20.015
How about you tell me your name?

09:21.061 --> 09:23.473
- lt's Lucy.
- And what's your real name?

09:24.231 --> 09:26.722
- Next time, don't think about it.
- I didn't...

09:26.817 --> 09:28.478
Not even for a second.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.731
So, why "Lucy"?

09:31.822 --> 09:33.062
[Kate] She's a saint.

09:33.157 --> 09:35.193
I had to memorize them
in Sunday school,

09:35.284 --> 09:37.741
so they're still rattling
around in my brain.

09:37.828 --> 09:41.195
What makes a girl who went
to Sunday school scared of cops?

09:48.630 --> 09:50.882
A few months ago I killed my stepfather

09:50.966 --> 09:54.424
and escaped from the Marshal
who arrested me for it.

09:56.889 --> 09:58.345
- Why?
- [sighs]

10:00.642 --> 10:02.678
Because he was a bad guy.

10:06.023 --> 10:09.732
So, what the hell are you doing in Iowa?

10:11.361 --> 10:12.817
I want to talk to my mother.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.571
You're gonna have
a really hard time doing that.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.617
If you did what you just said you did,

10:21.705 --> 10:24.447
the feds are gonna be
watching her 24/7.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.032
- l'll figure something out.
- Oh, you will, huh?

10:27.961 --> 10:29.701
What, you want to help me?

10:35.844 --> 10:37.345
Absolutely.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.670
VVhy?

10:45.562 --> 10:47.678
I fell in love with the wrong guy.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.231
And then I gave him my life savings.

10:52.903 --> 10:55.736
He conned me and embarrassed me.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.484
He was a bad guy.

10:59.660 --> 11:04.575
So, I'll help you get the meeting
with your mom, "Lucy",

11:04.665 --> 11:08.032
because one of us
deserves something good.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.213
[moaning]

11:36.029 --> 11:38.020
[panting]

12:25.412 --> 12:27.528
I ain't gonna get the Korean vote.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.494
Oh... Oh!

12:36.006 --> 12:37.997
Shoot. What the...

12:39.593 --> 12:41.675
Come here. Come on.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.674
[sighs] Uh...

12:55.192 --> 12:56.523
[groans]

13:07.037 --> 13:08.993
All right. Let's do it.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.450
Do what?

13:12.209 --> 13:14.541
I'm ready to do it.
Make amends.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.334
Change the vote.

13:17.923 --> 13:20.585
I don't want to be banished, OK?
You happy?

13:22.010 --> 13:23.546
Dude, you stink.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.840
What is that? Fish?

13:27.224 --> 13:29.681
- No.
- Did you try to gut one yourself?

13:31.186 --> 13:35.054
How have you not learned that by now?
We've been here three months.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.855
- Could we just do this?
- Do what?

13:39.403 --> 13:40.563
Make nice?

13:42.406 --> 13:44.897
Apologize for calling me
all those names.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.907
I'm really sorry I called you "rotund".

13:52.249 --> 13:54.956
- Really?
- Oh, God. You're worse than a girl.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.584
Come on, let's spread the love.

14:28.785 --> 14:29.900
[gasps]

14:31.079 --> 14:33.456
- What am I doing here?
- Why don't you tell me?

14:33.540 --> 14:36.202
- I don't know.
- Well, I don't know, either.

14:36.293 --> 14:38.500
So, why don't you let go of my wrist?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.791
[Kate panting]

15:00.025 --> 15:01.515
So, what the hell happened?

15:03.528 --> 15:07.567
l was making a cup of tea.
A canister came in through the window.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.318
So, what did you do to piss them off?

15:13.955 --> 15:17.368
You're wasting your time.
The knife is too big.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.413
- Use something smaller.
- We're going back.

15:20.504 --> 15:23.917
What? They did this to us.
Why would we go back?

15:24.007 --> 15:26.589
You say "they" like you didn't
lock me in a cage

15:26.676 --> 15:28.507
and watch me break rocks all day.

15:33.350 --> 15:37.969
We're going back to your village because
my friends were probably gassed like us.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.976
Your people are gone anyway.
I saw them all pack up and leave.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.774
- What?
- Locke came in and he said goodbye.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.894
They were going somewhere else.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.320
Going? Going where?

15:49.407 --> 15:51.318
He didn't exactly tell me.

15:54.955 --> 15:58.868
Welcome to the wonderful world
of not knowing what the hell's going on.

16:26.945 --> 16:30.153
[man] Go, go, go!
On the ground.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.697
Get down. On the ground!

16:32.784 --> 16:34.445
Let's see those hands.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.401
- Get back in the house.
- [man 2] Got her.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.157
Let me see those hands.

16:38.248 --> 16:39.658
[police chatter on radio]

16:39.749 --> 16:41.910
Long time no see, Austen.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.917
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm just selling Bibles.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.945
[knocking on door]

17:22.167 --> 17:23.282
Hi.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.249
They questioned me for half an hour.

17:28.340 --> 17:30.626
He confiscated my case.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.550
He was asking me about selling Bibles...

17:33.637 --> 17:35.423
It's a good thing I know how to lie.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.890
Yeah. Now we know
what we're up against.

17:37.974 --> 17:41.887
Now we know there were six guys
waiting to take you down, Lucy.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.809
Yeah, it's OK.
I'll figure it out.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.558
Figure it out?

17:45.649 --> 17:48.891
That Marshal,
I don't know what you did to him,

17:48.985 --> 17:52.148
but if he ever gets his hands on you,
it is gonna be you or him.

17:52.239 --> 17:56.357
Look, if you've changed your mind,
if you don't want to help me, | get it.

17:56.451 --> 18:00.069
No, I do want to help you.
But if I'm lying to federal agents,

18:00.163 --> 18:02.575
so that you can have a chat
with your mom,

18:03.291 --> 18:06.749
then I at least need to know
that there's a pretty good reason.

18:09.923 --> 18:13.290
He, uh... used to get drunk,

18:13.885 --> 18:17.173
and beat up my mom,
so I blew up his house.

18:18.056 --> 18:21.548
I made it look like an accident.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.555
A gas leak.

18:25.814 --> 18:28.180
Took out an insurance policy
on the house...

18:28.900 --> 18:30.231
...for her.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.942
Set her up for life.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.152
And then she gave me up.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.069
Chose him over me.

18:44.499 --> 18:48.242
So the reason I need to talk to her is,

18:48.336 --> 18:50.042
someone I love,

18:50.130 --> 18:55.170
someone who's supposed
to care about me, betrayed me.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.046
And I want to know why.

19:00.348 --> 19:01.508
Well,

19:02.475 --> 19:03.760
then let's go find out.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.147
[Juliet] What are you doing?

19:11.901 --> 19:15.359
Whoever dragged us out here
left a trail that will lead us back.

19:15.447 --> 19:16.653
Let's go.

19:17.407 --> 19:20.740
It's gonna rain. Don't you think
we should wait till morning?

19:22.245 --> 19:23.576
No.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.757
- Why?
- Why what?

19:34.841 --> 19:39.175
Why would they handcuff you to me
and then drag us out into the jungle?

19:39.262 --> 19:41.844
Ben has a thing for mind games.

19:42.849 --> 19:46.512
- Is that why he left you behind?
- Do we really have to talk?

19:47.437 --> 19:49.428
- Nope.
- [thunderclap]

19:55.320 --> 19:57.561
Come on.
If the trail gets wet l'll lose it.

19:57.655 --> 20:01.273
I hope you're not dragging me
all the way back there with you for him.

20:03.119 --> 20:06.452
- Excuse me?
- I hope you're not going back for Jack.

20:07.415 --> 20:12.455
Because I was standing right there
when he told you not to come back.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.457
Now that you've ruined his chance
to get off the island...

20:15.548 --> 20:17.163
[grunts]

20:28.645 --> 20:31.057
- [grunting]
- Are you done?

20:31.981 --> 20:33.357
I said are you...?

20:33.441 --> 20:35.557
[cracking]

20:38.488 --> 20:40.319
[crying]

20:40.407 --> 20:42.238
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

20:42.325 --> 20:45.317
- [thump]
- [roaring]

20:46.788 --> 20:48.653
What the hell was that?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.626
[roaring]

20:59.717 --> 21:01.753
- Get up.
- You dislocated my shoulder.

21:01.845 --> 21:02.960
Get up!

21:03.847 --> 21:06.589
- Come on.
- [Juliet groaning]

21:12.564 --> 21:14.350
Quick, in here. Come on.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.730
Get in here. Quick.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.233
Get down.
Get down.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.732
- [gasping] What the hell?
- Shh!

21:24.200 --> 21:27.408
- [gurgling]
- [growling]

21:28.496 --> 21:31.829
[stomping]

21:43.178 --> 21:45.169
[low growling]

21:50.894 --> 21:53.180
[chittering]

21:56.733 --> 21:58.769
[stomping]

22:09.579 --> 22:10.785
Are we safe?

22:11.748 --> 22:13.363
You tell me.

22:25.678 --> 22:29.170
- I ain't kissing no damn baby.
- Claire's really influential.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.301
She votes for you, you're home free.

22:31.392 --> 22:35.101
Why wouldn't she vote for me? It's not
like I ever done anything bad to her.

22:35.188 --> 22:38.555
No, but you never did anything
good for her, either.

22:38.650 --> 22:40.982
And have you
ever even asked how Aaron is?

22:41.069 --> 22:43.902
Well, I know how he is. He...

22:43.988 --> 22:47.321
- He cries loud and he smells.
- That's what I'm talking about.

22:47.408 --> 22:48.568
You're sarcastic.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.742
- People don't like that.
- All right.

22:50.828 --> 22:54.036
So I go over and do what?

22:55.291 --> 22:58.374
Moms love it when you show
an interest in their babies.

22:58.461 --> 23:02.704
So go over there, say something nice,
call her "Claire"...

23:02.799 --> 23:04.585
...and give her this.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.917
I know you can do it, dude.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.803
Hey, Claire.

23:15.687 --> 23:16.972
Hey.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.104
Hey there, little baby...

23:21.484 --> 23:22.894
...Aaron.

23:22.986 --> 23:25.819
[Aaron crying]

23:25.905 --> 23:28.396
ls, uh, is there anything
I can do for you?

23:28.491 --> 23:32.234
No. | just came by to say your baby's...

23:36.749 --> 23:39.240
He's not as wrinkly
as he was a couple weeks ago.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.924
Yeah, I guess he's not.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.626
Thanks.

23:50.513 --> 23:52.754
Oh, and, uh, this is for you.

23:54.225 --> 23:56.762
- Thank you.
- I don't like...

23:57.478 --> 23:58.684
...blankets.

24:01.524 --> 24:03.981
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

24:11.159 --> 24:13.525
[panting]

24:14.871 --> 24:17.362
Do you think it's gone?
Are we safe?

24:18.625 --> 24:19.956
- Are you serious?
- What?

24:20.043 --> 24:22.910
- You've never seen that?
- If you don't believe me

24:23.004 --> 24:26.041
you can pull my other shoulder
out of its socket.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.748
- I wasn't trying to...
- Don't flatter yourself.

24:28.843 --> 24:31.459
This is the fourth time
it's been dislocated.

24:38.728 --> 24:40.059
[winces]

24:40.938 --> 24:42.929
[muffled groaning]

24:44.317 --> 24:46.558
Gimme your hand.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.564
- Why?
- I want you to pop it back in.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.441
- I'm not gonna...
- You're gonna.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.989
Right now it feels like
there's broken glass under my skin

24:54.077 --> 24:58.821
and if it weren't for you,
I would be on my way home right now.

24:58.915 --> 25:01.497
Jack told me not to come back
to protect me.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.620
Because he didn't want me to get hurt.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.872
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah. That's what I think.

25:09.759 --> 25:12.751
We have cameras on the cages, Kate.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.091
All of them.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.013
He saw you.

25:18.101 --> 25:20.934
You and Sawyer.

25:21.854 --> 25:25.312
The reason Jack told you
not to come back

25:26.025 --> 25:29.563
wasn't because
he didn't want you to get hurt.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.608
It was because you broke his heart.

25:36.619 --> 25:39.702
So grab my wrist,

25:40.206 --> 25:42.618
push up, and twist.

25:53.136 --> 25:55.798
- [cracking]
- [screams]

26:04.731 --> 26:06.847
Why do we gotta be out here
so damn early?

26:06.941 --> 26:09.398
You asked me
to help you catch a boar.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.310
This is when they break cover to eat.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.901
Looks like they picked today
to sleep in.

26:15.992 --> 26:19.735
- So what's your angle, brother?
- My angle?

26:19.829 --> 26:22.912
Well, you haven't spoken
three words to me,

26:22.999 --> 26:26.287
and suddenly you want to be
my hunting partner.

26:27.795 --> 26:32.209
My angle is I've got
hearts and minds to change.

26:32.300 --> 26:35.383
And politics is all about bribes.

26:37.180 --> 26:40.013
Since money don't mean squat
on this island,

26:40.892 --> 26:43.850
I gotta give the people
something they like.

26:44.479 --> 26:46.344
- And people like meat.
- Shh.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.602
- [snorting]
- [rifle cocking]

26:52.069 --> 26:53.934
- [boar squealing]
- [thud]

27:00.620 --> 27:03.362
[gasps, panting]

27:09.837 --> 27:11.043
How's your shoulder?

27:13.341 --> 27:15.457
- Awesome.
- Then let's get going.

27:27.230 --> 27:28.436
Thank you.

27:29.190 --> 27:30.851
You're welcome, sweetheart.

27:47.917 --> 27:49.202
- Oh, my God.
- [clatter]

27:49.293 --> 27:50.999
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

27:51.087 --> 27:52.998
- No worries.
- I'm such an idiot.

27:53.089 --> 27:55.171
It happens all the time, sweetheart.

27:56.425 --> 27:57.801
Oh, thank you.

28:08.229 --> 28:09.810
[stall door opens]

28:18.364 --> 28:19.820
Hi, Mom.

28:22.118 --> 28:24.279
What are you doing here, Katherine?

28:27.623 --> 28:29.579
You look good.

28:30.126 --> 28:31.991
| asked you what you are doing here.

28:37.717 --> 28:40.504
I want to know why you told them
what I did to Wayne.

28:44.432 --> 28:48.425
I thought maybe you came because
you wanted to say you were sorry.

28:48.978 --> 28:50.184
I'm not sorry.

28:52.481 --> 28:55.223
He hit you.
He treated you like a dog.

28:55.318 --> 28:57.809
You can't help who you love, Katherine.

28:58.863 --> 29:01.821
And for good or bad, I loved him.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.195
And you burnt him alive.

29:05.828 --> 29:08.160
You turned on the gas
and you lit a match.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.864
You murdered him in cold blood.

29:13.669 --> 29:16.661
- I did it for you.
- No.

29:17.381 --> 29:19.872
What you did, you did for yourself.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.011
l have to go back to work.

29:28.351 --> 29:30.763
Because you are my daughter,

29:30.853 --> 29:33.435
I'm not gonna tell the two men
sitting at the table

29:33.522 --> 29:37.106
who've been following me
for the last month that you are here.

29:37.193 --> 29:39.605
- But I swear to God, Katie,
- [Kate sniffles]

29:39.695 --> 29:41.526
if I ever see you again,

29:42.740 --> 29:44.981
the first thing I will do
is yell for help.

29:50.206 --> 29:51.446
Goodbye.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.531
- [sobs]
- [door closes]

30:07.390 --> 30:09.301
- Did he say that to you?
- Sorry?

30:10.726 --> 30:12.057
That I broke his heart?

30:13.688 --> 30:15.269
He didn't have to.

30:19.026 --> 30:22.314
- You don't know anything about him.
- I know where he was born.

30:22.405 --> 30:25.488
I know what his parents did
for a living, that he was married.

30:26.784 --> 30:30.242
And who he was married to.
I know why he got a divorce.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.490
I know how his father died.

30:32.581 --> 30:35.288
I know his height, his weight,
his birthday,

30:35.376 --> 30:37.082
and his blood type.

30:39.296 --> 30:41.423
What do you know about him, Kate?

30:47.138 --> 30:48.298
Let's go.

30:50.433 --> 30:53.049
[chittering and growling]

30:54.854 --> 30:56.310
[stomping and growling]

30:56.397 --> 30:57.477
Run.

30:57.565 --> 30:59.271
Run! Run!

31:00.776 --> 31:02.607
[creature roaring]

31:15.249 --> 31:17.456
Get up. Get up!

31:17.543 --> 31:19.534
Run, run! Come on!

31:19.628 --> 31:21.209
[creature roaring]

31:21.297 --> 31:22.958
- Stop. Wait.
- What are you doing?

31:23.049 --> 31:25.882
I know what happens
if you step through those things!

31:25.968 --> 31:28.755
- We go alongside.
- We don't need to! They're off!

31:30.431 --> 31:31.967
- Damn it!
- What?

31:33.726 --> 31:35.842
[roaring]

31:41.817 --> 31:44.650
- You're gonna want to be over here.
- [creature growling]

31:45.821 --> 31:47.527
Kate, come on!

31:48.324 --> 31:50.485
[stomping]

31:51.660 --> 31:54.322
[high-pitched humming]

31:58.834 --> 32:01.325
[creature roaring]

32:05.716 --> 32:09.174
[droning hum]

32:12.807 --> 32:15.048
[creature shrieking]

32:28.989 --> 32:32.698
We don't know what it is, but we know
that it doesn't like our fence.

32:32.785 --> 32:34.366
You had a key.

32:36.038 --> 32:39.747
They left me behind. They gassed me.
I know that you don't care,

32:39.834 --> 32:43.122
but the people I spent
the last three years of my life with,

32:43.212 --> 32:44.873
they just left me.

32:48.843 --> 32:50.799
I thought that maybe,

32:51.554 --> 32:54.671
maybe if I could make you think
that we were in it together...

32:58.060 --> 33:00.847
Maybe I wouldn't get left behind again.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.750
- [sizzling]
- [chuckles]

33:34.680 --> 33:35.920
Mmm.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.098
lt's delicious!

33:40.186 --> 33:43.144
Just a little Dharma A-1 and paprika.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.523
I hope you'll remember this
at your meeting.

33:47.610 --> 33:49.771
What meeting?

33:51.697 --> 33:54.109
- Hurley told me about the vote.
- Vote?

33:54.783 --> 33:56.944
Since when did anyone around here vote?

34:07.755 --> 34:09.711
You son of a bitch.

34:09.798 --> 34:12.255
- There was never gonna be no vote.
- Right.

34:13.510 --> 34:16.001
But wasn't it nice, being nice?

34:16.096 --> 34:18.303
You tricked me into being decent?

34:18.390 --> 34:21.223
That's gotta be the lamest con
in the history of cons.

34:21.310 --> 34:22.550
It wasn't a con, dude.

34:22.645 --> 34:26.229
If you're gonna be our temporary leader
you need to do damage control.

34:26.315 --> 34:28.727
Leader?
What the hell are you smoking?

34:28.817 --> 34:31.194
Jack's gone, Locke's gone.

34:31.278 --> 34:33.269
Kate and Sayid...

34:34.156 --> 34:35.396
You're all we got.

34:36.075 --> 34:37.531
Paulo and Nikki died.

34:38.035 --> 34:39.366
We all look to you.

34:39.453 --> 34:43.571
You totally tried to steal the diamonds,
but we wanted to look to you.

34:43.666 --> 34:44.997
Look around.

34:45.834 --> 34:48.917
- You made everyone happy.
- [man] It's great!

34:49.630 --> 34:53.248
Just for today,
they can eat boar, laugh,

34:53.342 --> 34:56.175
and forget that they're totally screwed.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.628
And you did that
for them, dude. You.

35:02.643 --> 35:07.387
- What if I don't want to be the leader?
- I don't think Jack wanted it, either.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.182
Sucks for you, dude.

36:45.037 --> 36:48.700
Sayid's in one of those backyards
down there. I'll go get him.

36:50.167 --> 36:52.203
You should get Jack.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.182
Jack?

37:09.269 --> 37:12.887
Jack? Hey.
Jack, wake up, it's me, Kate.

37:12.981 --> 37:14.972
[both gasping]

37:21.407 --> 37:24.774
- What happened?
- They all left.

37:26.829 --> 37:27.944
Left?

37:35.045 --> 37:36.876
- What?
- Because of me.

37:38.799 --> 37:40.005
[sighs] I'm so sorry.

37:42.302 --> 37:45.385
I should have listened to you.
lneven”

37:51.854 --> 37:54.015
I wanted to come back to help you.

37:55.566 --> 37:57.477
But you didn't need me to.

38:02.197 --> 38:04.313
And now, because of me, you can't go.

38:10.539 --> 38:12.530
[sobbing]

38:17.880 --> 38:19.791
[softly] I'm so sorry.

38:22.759 --> 38:24.420
I am so sorry.

38:28.557 --> 38:30.218
They just...

38:31.560 --> 38:33.016
...left?

38:38.233 --> 38:39.939
Even... Even Juliet?

38:47.075 --> 38:48.485
No, they left her too.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.612
[sighs] Why?

38:57.920 --> 38:59.911
You know her better than I do.

39:06.136 --> 39:07.342
Now what?

39:09.932 --> 39:11.342
[sighs]

39:13.393 --> 39:14.599
Now...

39:18.065 --> 39:19.271
Now we go back.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.930
- Thanks for everything, Cassidy.
- You got it.

40:00.691 --> 40:03.103
So, this guy who ripped you off?

40:04.111 --> 40:07.023
Will you give me his name?
Tell me where I can find him?

40:08.407 --> 40:11.274
You almost got arrested for me.
I want to help you.

40:14.246 --> 40:15.952
I'm pregnant.

40:16.790 --> 40:18.075
Oh.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.370
It's his. The baby's his.

40:22.504 --> 40:26.417
- And I still love him.
- So call the cops. Have him locked up.

40:26.508 --> 40:29.545
Will you ever forgive your mom
for calling the cops?

40:30.178 --> 40:31.384
No.

40:32.556 --> 40:34.046
No, I won't.

40:43.775 --> 40:44.935
Thanks, Lucy.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.269
My name's Kate.

41:04.212 --> 41:05.497
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:07.257 --> 41:08.417
You OK?

41:09.384 --> 41:10.544
Yeah.

41:10.636 --> 41:12.001
You?

41:14.222 --> 41:15.348
Yeah.

41:21.897 --> 41:22.977
Jack.

41:26.943 --> 41:28.103
Sayid.

41:28.195 --> 41:30.402
I checked all the houses.

41:30.489 --> 41:32.150
Everyone's gone.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.105
No weapons, no trail.

41:34.743 --> 41:37.610
It's like 50 people disappeared
into thin air.

41:38.914 --> 41:42.907
We should take what we can find
and head out while we still got light.

41:47.172 --> 41:48.673
She is not coming with us.

41:52.636 --> 41:55.093
- Yes, she is.
- Why?

41:59.768 --> 42:01.679
Because they left her behind, too.
