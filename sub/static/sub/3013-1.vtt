Day after day...

00:17.996 --> 00:21.645
I hate television.
It gives me headaches.

00:21.646 --> 00:25.087
There are so many magnetic waves
traveling in the airspace

00:25.088 --> 00:27.275
because of TV and television,
we're losing

00:27.276 --> 00:29.362
10 times as many brain cells
as we're supposed to.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.072
Oh, please.

Dude!

00:38.904 --> 00:40.518
"Dude"!

00:40.519 --> 00:43.542
I don't know.
Magnetic waves, brain cells.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.941
I don't understand the
connection between that stuff.

00:45.942 --> 00:47.713
You know what else I heard?

00:47.818 --> 00:51.050
Magnetic waves shrink
silicone molecules.

00:52.927 --> 00:53.969
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:53.970 --> 00:56.055
Oh, my God!
Turn it off!

00:56.159 --> 00:57.150
It's not working!

00:57.151 --> 00:58.139
It's backwards!

00:58.141 --> 00:59.600
- What do we do?
- I don't know!

00:59.601 --> 01:01.476
Oh, my God!

01:01.477 --> 01:03.980
[Television clicks off,
both sigh]

01:03.981 --> 01:05.647
That was kind of scary.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.942
- I know something even scarier.
- What?

01:08.046 --> 01:09.401
Have you heard about
this videotape?

01:09.402 --> 01:11.696
Where they do it on the boat?
And then in the car?

01:11.697 --> 01:12.737
And then in the bathtub?

01:12.738 --> 01:16.075
He's like, "Baby, I love you."
And she's like, "Where are we?"

01:16.076 --> 01:17.535
- And did you see the...
- No.

01:17.536 --> 01:19.202
- Not that tape.
- Oh.

01:19.203 --> 01:21.079
The one with
all the scary images.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.583
After you watch the tape,
the phone rings.

01:23.687 --> 01:26.919
And this scary voice comes on
and says you're gonna die in...

01:26.920 --> 01:29.422
Seven days. I saw that one
with Josh last weekend.

01:29.526 --> 01:31.716
You were with Josh last weekend?

01:31.717 --> 01:34.010
- Oh, my God!
- [Laughs]

01:35.991 --> 01:37.972
Oh, yes, I was.

trying to tell us.

ANNOUNCER:
And now...

05:54.896 --> 05:58.024
Washington, D.C.'s
leading morning news program,

05:58.025 --> 05:59.691
"The Morning News."

05:59.692 --> 06:01.359
Good morning.
I'm Ross Giggins.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.863
For our top story,
we turn now to Cindy Campbell.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.323
Thank you, Ross.

06:05.427 --> 06:08.034
There's a developing story
in Middleburg at this hour.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.119
A mysterious
crop circle appeared

06:10.223 --> 06:13.038
in local farmer Tom Logan's
cornfield.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.792
Elaborate prank
or extraterrestrial phenomenon?

06:16.897 --> 06:20.025
We'll update you as soon as we
have any further information.

06:20.026 --> 06:22.215
But either way,
it's clear something strange

06:22.216 --> 06:24.300
is happening in that small town.

06:24.404 --> 06:26.280
Ross?

06:26.281 --> 06:28.419
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

06:28.420 --> 06:30.556
Coming up, more news after this.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.205
- Cindy, you got a second?
- Sure.

06:34.206 --> 06:37.438
I want you to take a look at
this for that strip club exposé.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.628
But I'd rather stick with
the crop circle story.

06:39.629 --> 06:41.816
Oh, come on. You know
those things are just a hoax.

06:41.817 --> 06:44.946
No, I'm telling you, I sense
something about that cornfield.

06:44.947 --> 06:47.865
Call it women's intuition
or ESPN or both.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.742

06:53.809 --> 06:57.250
Cindy, it's sweeps month.
Ratings mean everything.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.961
People want
human interest stories.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.681
Like the one you did yesterday.

07:01.682 --> 07:03.401
The report
on breast augmentation?

07:03.402 --> 07:05.800
It was just 10 minutes
of topless women.

07:05.801 --> 07:08.302
I mean, come on.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.761

07:09.762 --> 07:11.222

07:11.326 --> 07:12.681
Oh, for God's sake.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.975
[Sighs]
People don't care about this.

07:14.976 --> 07:18.729
They want hard-hitting stories
and in-depth coverage and...

07:18.730 --> 07:19.980

the Kreisel boys

07:41.931 --> 07:44.145
who cut that stuff
into your corn?

07:44.146 --> 07:46.360
All I know is my crops are gone.

07:46.361 --> 07:49.698
The bank's gonna foreclose
if I can't pay the rent.

07:49.699 --> 07:53.139
I got 60 days
to come up with $ 1.50.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.849
I'm sorry.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.101
The last thing you needed
was more...

07:57.205 --> 07:58.561
[Blowing nose]

07:58.665 --> 08:01.271
...hardship in your life.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.253

what happened to...

08:03.254 --> 08:05.495
Sheriff, I don't need
your sympathy.

08:05.496 --> 08:07.737
I didn't mean to upset you,
Father.

08:07.841 --> 08:11.230
Please.
I'm not a minister anymore.

08:11.231 --> 08:14.619
I lost my faith
that terrible night.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.286
Your faith will return.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.311
Just as sure
as the sun will rise.

08:19.312 --> 08:20.665
Sounds like a long shot.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.908
Look, there's always
an explanation

08:22.909 --> 08:25.150
for all this so-called
phenomena.

08:25.151 --> 08:26.401
Maybe you're right.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.591
It was probably
just the Kreisels.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.675
And when I get through
with them,

08:30.676 --> 08:33.179
I doubt you'll be seeing
anything strange on this farm

08:33.179 --> 08:34.429
for a long time.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.515
You'll see.

do something with your life?

09:09.049 --> 09:09.881

09:09.882 --> 09:12.279
- What is your dream?
- To have a dream.

09:23.125 --> 09:25.627
this hip-hop thing is gonna
get me paid.

'cause I'm black.

09:32.237 --> 09:34.281
You don't have any faith in me.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.367
You don't have any faith
in anything anymore.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.244
So why don't you just worry
about you,

09:38.245 --> 09:41.164

Oh, too long.
I've been working so hard.

10:15.677 --> 10:17.867
I've had to spend more

10:20.787 --> 10:22.662

10:27.460 --> 10:30.536
Well, you know, I just haven't
found the right guy.

I'm looking for something more
than just good sex.

10:33.613 --> 10:35.175

You want commitment.

No, I want great sex.

I need to...

23:02.278 --> 23:03.944
I saw a tape.

about it.

too far, Brenda.

Live!

34:07.109 --> 34:09.090
Live, damn it!
Live!

34:10.445 --> 34:12.373
Let me open her windpipe!

34:12.375 --> 34:14.069
MRS. MEEKS:
No! Oh, God!

34:14.070 --> 34:15.763
Charles!
Charles, stop them!

34:15.764 --> 34:17.639
Breathe!

34:19.621 --> 34:22.437
Someone stop them!
What are they doing?!

34:22.437 --> 34:24.103
Get up!

34:24.105 --> 34:26.293
She's alive!
She's alive!

34:26.295 --> 34:28.953
Wake up!
Breathe!

34:28.954 --> 34:31.612
[All shouting]

34:38.286 --> 34:40.996
- Charles! Charles!
- Clear!

34:41.101 --> 34:43.081
No!

34:44.958 --> 34:47.565
Aah!

34:47.565 --> 34:49.650
I got something!
I got something!

34:49.652 --> 34:52.987
[Gasps, screams]

34:55.594 --> 34:57.053
Aah!

34:57.054 --> 34:58.410
- That's it!
- George!

34:58.514 --> 35:01.434
That's the last time I try to
bring anyone back from the dead.

35:01.435 --> 35:03.467
George, don't get down
on yourself.

35:03.468 --> 35:05.500
I know you were only trying
to help.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.733
You're a good, caring person.

35:08.734 --> 35:10.922
Which is why I like you.

35:10.923 --> 35:12.277
Oh, thanks, Cindy.

35:12.278 --> 35:14.675
But I don't want to
screw your life up, too.

35:14.676 --> 35:16.657
The most caring thing I could do
for everyone right now

35:16.658 --> 35:19.056
is to just get out of here.

35:19.057 --> 35:21.454
George!
What about Sue?

35:22.184 --> 35:24.373
Oh, yes.
Of course.

35:24.478 --> 35:26.250
Once I get Sue, then...

35:26.251 --> 35:27.501
Wait!

35:29.378 --> 35:32.298
I could really use a friend
right now.

35:35.113 --> 35:38.763
Brenda's gone.
Cody resents me.

35:39.388 --> 35:42.725
And I'm caught up in something
I can't even...

35:42.726 --> 35:44.809
Oh, God, it's so hard!

35:44.811 --> 35:49.607
Well, you're beautiful and
you're pressing up against me.

35:50.858 --> 35:53.464
Look, Cindy.

35:53.465 --> 35:56.385
I know you'd never consider
going out with a guy like me.

35:56.386 --> 36:00.868
But if you're not too busy
tomorrow night...

36:02.641 --> 36:04.830
Is that a yes?

36:04.832 --> 36:06.290
Yes.

36:11.816 --> 36:15.675
Cindy, did Brenda
ever talk to you about a tape?

36:15.779 --> 36:17.550
She did mention something.

36:17.552 --> 36:19.846
Do you mind if I go upstairs
and look around?

36:19.847 --> 36:22.243
Yes, go.
Of course. Go.

36:22.244 --> 36:24.955
Cody, I'll be right back, okay?

36:24.956 --> 36:27.614
You're getting lucky tonight.

36:27.615 --> 36:30.273
He doesn't know you're a guy.

[Mumbling]

38:21.635 --> 38:22.677
What?

38:22.781 --> 38:24.136
Can you hear me now?

38:24.137 --> 38:25.387
Kind of.

38:25.388 --> 38:27.473
- Can you hear me now?
- Yes. Perfect.

38:27.474 --> 38:28.829
Seven days.

38:28.830 --> 38:30.184
Seven days.

38:30.288 --> 38:32.270
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die next Monday?

38:32.271 --> 38:33.624
Yes.
No. Wait.

38:33.625 --> 38:35.815
Monday. That would be
seven business days.

38:35.816 --> 38:37.899
This is seven days starting now.

38:37.900 --> 38:40.820
So seven days to this very hour?
My watch broke.

38:40.821 --> 38:42.071
How am I gonna know
the exact hour?

38:42.280 --> 38:44.990
Forget hours.
This day seven days from now.

38:44.991 --> 38:47.806
But there's a holiday coming up.
Do you count the holiday?

38:47.807 --> 38:49.579
Well, that depends.
What holiday?

38:49.683 --> 38:51.663
- Martin Luther King Day.
- Then no.

38:51.664 --> 38:54.166
Why not? Everybody at work
is taking it off.

38:54.166 --> 38:56.459
Jesus Christ, lady. I'm giving
you seven friggin' days.

38:56.460 --> 38:59.067
I can come over now and kill the
shit out of you if you'd rather.

38:59.068 --> 39:01.466
[Click, dial tone]

39:03.342 --> 39:05.376
Yo, George, I don't care
what you say, man.

39:05.377 --> 39:07.409
I'm signing you up
for another rap battle.

39:07.513 --> 39:10.015
Mahalik, I told you.
That part of my life is over.

39:10.016 --> 39:12.518
I said the same thing about
getting with C.J.'s sister.

39:12.519 --> 39:15.021
- I'm still hitting that.
- He's still hitting it, man!

39:15.022 --> 39:17.106
And she fine as shit!
That's my sister! What?

39:17.315 --> 39:18.669
It doesn't matter.
I'm done.

39:18.670 --> 39:21.277
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

[Laughs]

39:23.258 --> 39:26.072
Yeah! Yeah!
A-come on!

39:26.073 --> 39:29.201

Maybe I should just settle down.

[Laughing]

39:31.287 --> 39:32.747
- What's up, then?!
- Mother...

39:32.748 --> 39:33.790
I got another one, y'all.

39:33.998 --> 39:37.543
Yo, George, man, you can't focus
on that shit, man.

39:37.544 --> 39:39.629
- Let that go.
- [Laughing]

39:39.733 --> 39:42.861
Hey, you got to try
this shit, George.

39:43.695 --> 39:45.259

Yo, man, you got to take
the lid off!

terrible has happened!

[Gasps]

39:58.397 --> 40:00.274
Cindy, are you okay?
What's going on?

40:00.275 --> 40:02.150
George, you have to help me.

40:02.151 --> 40:04.861
I just watched the same tape
that killed Brenda.

40:04.862 --> 40:08.407
Then the phone rang, and this
voice said I was gonna die.

40:08.408 --> 40:10.910
Cindy, there's no such thing
as a killer videotape.

40:10.911 --> 40:12.682
- Oh.
- Hell, yeah, there is!

40:12.683 --> 40:14.299
I know somebody who can
help you.

40:14.300 --> 40:15.914
- You do? Who?
- Wait up, man.

40:15.915 --> 40:19.043
I heard Jamal from 90th street
watched that tape last week.

40:19.044 --> 40:20.399
This morning he woke up dead.

40:20.503 --> 40:22.170
How in the hell
do you wake up dead?

40:22.171 --> 40:24.256
'Cause you're alive
when you go to sleep.

40:24.257 --> 40:27.176
You're telling me you can go
to bed dead and wake up alive?

40:27.177 --> 40:28.843
MAHALIK:
You can't go to bed dead!

40:28.844 --> 40:31.138
- That shit would be redundant.
- No, it wouldn't.

40:31.140 --> 40:33.328
'Cause you can go to bed
and not be dead.

40:33.329 --> 40:35.101
And you can die
but not be in a bed.

40:35.102 --> 40:36.351
But you are in a bed, man.

40:36.352 --> 40:39.063
That's how you wake up dead
in the first place!

40:39.064 --> 40:41.774
Damn! That's some quantum shit
right there, man!

40:41.775 --> 40:44.171
You should be teaching classes!

40:44.172 --> 40:46.362
- Just tell me who can help me!
- Damn!

40:46.363 --> 40:47.405

40:47.509 --> 40:49.281
Her and her man
into this weird shit.

40:49.281 --> 40:52.097
They saw the tape before anybody
else knew about it.

40:52.098 --> 40:55.121
- Go see them tonight.
- Tonight? Yeah.

40:55.122 --> 40:57.415
But who will take care of Cody?

40:58.875 --> 41:00.960
CODY: George,
we're gonna have so much fun.

41:01.064 --> 41:02.941
I have some puzzles
and board games

41:02.942 --> 41:04.608
and baseball cards in my room

41:04.609 --> 41:06.278
and this really cool
model airplane.

41:06.279 --> 41:07.790
- I'm gonna go get it.
- Sure.

41:07.791 --> 41:09.301
Okay, so I made him a snack.

41:09.302 --> 41:12.221
You can give him some warm milk
if he can't go to sleep.

41:12.222 --> 41:13.890
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Here it is.

41:13.891 --> 41:16.601

- Okay, I'm off.
- Right.

You know, it's funny.

is a family.

- Yes. I watched it and...
- The phone rang.

- That you would die.

Yes. Okay.

43:44.457 --> 43:46.020
ShaNeequa, can you tell me if...

43:46.021 --> 43:50.035
The tape is connected to the
crop circles and the aliens?

43:50.036 --> 43:54.050
Yes. But it's up to you
to discover how for yourself.

57:55.725 --> 57:57.809
recognize those
who have overcome

57:57.810 --> 58:00.104
the severest handicaps
and disadvantages

58:00.105 --> 58:02.398
to help others
in their communities.

58:02.502 --> 58:05.734
The young, the old.
Black and white.

58:05.735 --> 58:08.446
Our Native American friends.
Hey, how are you?

58:08.447 --> 58:11.157
[Chanting] Hey, how are you?
Hey, how are you?

58:11.158 --> 58:12.408
Hey, how are you?

58:12.512 --> 58:15.952
Ah.
Well, it is therefore my honor

58:15.953 --> 58:20.958
to present each and every one of
you with this symbol of merit.

58:25.963 --> 58:28.049
The room is secure,
Mr. President.

58:28.050 --> 58:30.237
- Or is it?
- Sir?

58:30.238 --> 58:31.593
I've been thinking, Thompson.

58:31.594 --> 58:34.096
What if the aliens could
take over human bodies?

58:34.097 --> 58:35.660
They'd look just like us.

58:35.765 --> 58:37.016
Or almost.

58:37.120 --> 58:38.579
I never thought of that, sir.

58:38.580 --> 58:40.978
We should be on alert
for anything suspicious.

58:40.979 --> 58:42.334
They could be anywhere.

58:42.335 --> 58:43.585
Even...

58:43.586 --> 58:44.784
Right here.

58:44.785 --> 58:45.983
My God.

58:46.087 --> 58:47.859
We'd never see
the attack coming.

58:47.860 --> 58:51.405
- It's frightening, sir!
- Don't panic.

58:51.406 --> 58:54.950
We'll just move slowly
toward the exit.

58:55.993 --> 58:58.704
[Mechanized voice]
At last we meet, Mr. President.

58:58.809 --> 59:00.216
It's happening.
I knew it.

59:00.217 --> 59:01.624
You'll never take me alive!

59:01.625 --> 59:02.874
Aaaah!

59:02.875 --> 59:05.273
Ah!
She's scrambling my brain!

59:05.274 --> 59:06.629
I'll get her!

59:07.880 --> 59:09.756
Aaah!

59:09.757 --> 59:12.468
Oh, no, you don't!
Not on my watch!

59:12.469 --> 59:14.136
Good work, sir!

59:15.805 --> 59:18.203
Good God!
The small ones have metal teeth!

59:18.204 --> 59:20.705
Jerry's kids, my ass!

59:21.540 --> 59:23.311
WILSON:
Mr. President!

59:23.312 --> 59:26.440
Mr. President, have you gone
completely insane?

59:26.441 --> 59:27.899
Like a fox.

59:27.900 --> 59:30.194
We got to talk to the person
who saw this coming,

59:30.195 --> 59:31.237
Cindy Campbell.

59:31.445 --> 59:33.114
She knows how
to defeat the aliens.

59:33.115 --> 59:35.303
- Filthy, rotten scum!
- Aah!

59:35.304 --> 59:36.815
Aah!
You're hideous!

59:36.816 --> 59:38.326
Get off my planet!

59:38.327 --> 59:41.247
- No!
- Is everything all right?

59:41.248 --> 59:42.498
The exits are all blocked.

59:42.499 --> 59:44.479
I'll find one, sir.

59:44.480 --> 59:46.460
Everybody, clear!

59:48.546 --> 59:51.464
This way, sir!
God, this is exciting!

59:51.465 --> 59:54.489
You're excited?
You should feel my nipples.

59:54.490 --> 59:56.261
Cody?

59:56.262 --> 59:59.494
Cody?
Cody, where are you?

59:59.495 --> 01:00:00.640
Honey?

01:00:00.641 --> 01:00:02.935
GIGGINS: After today's incident
in the East Room,

01:00:02.936 --> 01:00:05.645
the White House
is now advising all citizens

01:00:05.646 --> 01:00:09.504
to board up their homes and
prepare for an alien invasion.

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:11.277
Oh, no.

01:00:11.486 --> 01:00:13.987
And now a News 8 exclusive.

01:00:13.988 --> 01:00:16.282
The killer videotape
you've been hearing about.

01:00:16.283 --> 01:00:17.950
We're the only station
that has it,

01:00:18.054 --> 01:00:19.617
and we're showing it all night.

01:00:19.618 --> 01:00:21.704
Very exciting.
Let's roll it again.

01:00:26.083 --> 01:00:28.377
There. Nobody's getting
through that sucker.

01:00:28.378 --> 01:00:30.880
But we have to get down
to the cellar.

01:00:32.131 --> 01:00:33.956
- George.
- Cindy.

01:00:33.957 --> 01:00:35.781
There's no time.

01:00:35.885 --> 01:00:37.135
Cody.

01:00:37.136 --> 01:00:39.220
Thank God.
I've been worried sick.

01:00:39.221 --> 01:00:41.933
He showed up about an hour ago.
I tried to call.

01:00:41.934 --> 01:00:43.600
No, he didn't.

01:00:43.601 --> 01:00:45.686
Okay, but I was gonna.

01:00:45.791 --> 01:00:47.562
No, he wasn't.

01:00:47.563 --> 01:00:51.213
Cody, the point is you can't
just run away like that.

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:52.985
I wanted to be with George.

01:00:53.194 --> 01:00:55.905
Oh, honey, I know
you want a dad, but...

01:00:56.009 --> 01:00:59.033
Oh, trust me, Cody,
I'm not good at anything.

01:00:59.034 --> 01:01:00.493
Why would I be good at that?

01:01:00.494 --> 01:01:02.891
SUE:
Uncle George!

01:01:15.091 --> 01:01:17.593
It's gonna be okay, Cody.

01:01:17.594 --> 01:01:20.094
I'm going to die, aren't I?

01:01:20.096 --> 01:01:23.015
Cody, did I ever tell you
what your mom said

01:01:23.016 --> 01:01:25.101
about you
the day you were born?

01:01:25.102 --> 01:01:26.248
No.

01:01:26.352 --> 01:01:28.854
I was in the delivery room
with her.

01:01:28.855 --> 01:01:30.730
She was having a hard time.

01:01:30.731 --> 01:01:32.400
Then you began
to come out of her.

01:01:33.338 --> 01:01:35.528
And your mom screamed
and screamed in pain.

01:01:35.529 --> 01:01:37.300
She yelled, "Just kill me.

01:01:37.301 --> 01:01:39.073
Bludgeon me with a bedpan.

01:01:39.177 --> 01:01:41.992
Whatever you do,
put me out of this pain."

01:01:41.993 --> 01:01:44.181
She was gushing
torrents of blood.

01:01:44.182 --> 01:01:46.998
I have this all on tape
if you want to see it someday.

01:01:46.999 --> 01:01:48.874
Well, finally you came out.

01:01:48.875 --> 01:01:51.794
Your mom cut
your umbilical cord herself.

01:01:51.898 --> 01:01:54.921
Well, on the second try.

01:01:54.922 --> 01:01:57.633
The first time she snipped
your penis in half.

01:01:57.634 --> 01:01:59.197
After all, she was drunk.

01:01:59.198 --> 01:02:00.553
Actually, drugged.

01:02:00.761 --> 01:02:03.889
We'd been out the night before
celebrating St. Patrick's Day.

01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:06.184
She thought, "Hey,
I never tasted crystal meth."

01:02:06.185 --> 01:02:08.060
So she did just a little.

01:02:08.165 --> 01:02:09.312
My penis?

01:02:09.313 --> 01:02:10.145
Yes.

01:02:10.146 --> 01:02:12.857
They sewed it on upside down.

01:02:12.858 --> 01:02:14.733
So that's why I pee up?

01:02:14.734 --> 01:02:16.192
Yes.
We'll get it fixed, honey.

01:02:16.193 --> 01:02:19.218
It's on my list of things.
Right after we get TiVo.

01:02:19.218 --> 01:02:20.989
Anyway, there you were.

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:23.440
Your mom turned to me and said,

01:02:23.441 --> 01:02:25.891
"Hey, you want him?
Take him."

01:02:25.892 --> 01:02:27.507
Then she died.

01:02:27.508 --> 01:02:29.462
And I took you.

01:02:29.463 --> 01:02:31.416
Do you know why?

01:02:31.417 --> 01:02:33.084
I had just lost my cat
in a fire,

01:02:33.085 --> 01:02:35.067
and I needed something
to pet and feed.

01:02:35.068 --> 01:02:37.986
And I miss that cat, Cody.

01:02:37.987 --> 01:02:39.549
But I love you.

01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:41.739
And nothing's
ever gonna change that,

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.347
not even the very painful death
we're about to experience.

01:02:44.348 --> 01:02:46.015
TOM:
George!

01:02:47.579 --> 01:02:49.352
[Banging]

01:02:54.252 --> 01:02:55.190
Are they gone?

01:02:55.191 --> 01:02:56.442
I don't hear anything.

01:02:56.443 --> 01:02:57.693
[Banging]

01:03:03.115 --> 01:03:04.575
[Screams effeminately]

01:03:04.576 --> 01:03:05.930
Don't worry, Sue.

01:03:05.931 --> 01:03:07.182
SUE:
It was Uncle George.

01:03:07.286 --> 01:03:09.997
Well, it's scary.

01:03:11.249 --> 01:03:13.542
Good work, Sue.

01:03:13.647 --> 01:03:15.941
I don't know what stupid,
idiotic thing

01:03:15.942 --> 01:03:18.025
made these lights go off.

01:03:18.026 --> 01:03:20.633
All right, there's spare fuses
in the crawl space.

01:03:20.634 --> 01:03:22.197
I can get these lights back on.

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:23.448
[Banging]

01:03:23.552 --> 01:03:26.055
Quick, George,
grab that railroad tie.

01:03:26.056 --> 01:03:27.723
Jam it against the door.

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.392
- Oh!
- [Gasps]

01:03:29.393 --> 01:03:31.789
My balls!

01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:33.980
Oh!
Not those!

01:03:33.981 --> 01:03:35.439
Jesus!

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.899
No!

01:03:38.046 --> 01:03:38.985
SUE:
Uncle George!

01:03:38.986 --> 01:03:40.443
I'm scared!

01:03:40.444 --> 01:03:43.364
Oh, sweetie, come here.
It's okay.

01:03:43.365 --> 01:03:45.031
Aah!

01:03:45.032 --> 01:03:48.160
There's something
on the other side of the door.

01:04:01.507 --> 01:04:03.593
I can't see anything.

01:04:19.233 --> 01:04:20.484
Oh, my God.

01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:22.205
Can you see them?

01:04:22.206 --> 01:04:23.820
They're horrible.

01:04:23.821 --> 01:04:26.011
They're grayish
with big black eyes.

01:04:26.012 --> 01:04:27.783
Their teeth are grotesque.

01:04:27.784 --> 01:04:29.451
[Trilling]

01:04:29.452 --> 01:04:32.997
- I think they're giggling.
- What?

01:04:33.623 --> 01:04:34.665
Oh, no.

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:37.271
Oh, no, I think...

01:04:37.272 --> 01:04:39.879
- I think they want...
- [Banging]

01:04:41.443 --> 01:04:43.110
Aaah!
Help!

01:04:43.111 --> 01:04:44.780
Cody!
Oh, my God!

01:04:44.884 --> 01:04:47.281
George.
Swing away, George.

01:04:47.282 --> 01:04:49.263
- Aah! Aunt Cindy, help!
- I'm coming, Cody.

01:04:49.264 --> 01:04:50.723
I'll save you.

01:04:50.724 --> 01:04:52.183
- Ugh!
- Die!

01:04:55.311 --> 01:04:56.145
Die!

01:04:56.354 --> 01:04:58.282
You damn aliens, let him go!

01:04:58.283 --> 01:05:00.238
You're not getting in here!

01:05:00.239 --> 01:05:02.193
- What else you got?
- George.

01:05:02.194 --> 01:05:04.381
There!
Had enough?

01:05:04.383 --> 01:05:06.989
Yeah. Forget it, Cody.
Thank me later.

01:05:07.093 --> 01:05:08.866
Oh, Cody.
Oh, thank God.

01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:09.961
Come on.

01:05:09.962 --> 01:05:10.952
SUE:
Daddy!

01:05:11.056 --> 01:05:12.411
- Daddy!
- Sue!

01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:16.582
Oh!

01:05:16.791 --> 01:05:18.979
Mahalik,
what are you doing here?

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:21.639
I told you the hood's
always got your back.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:24.298
Thank God.
There's two of them at the door.

01:05:24.299 --> 01:05:25.132
They're gone.

01:05:26.488 --> 01:05:28.312
Good.
They couldn't get in.

01:05:28.314 --> 01:05:30.111
I hear they can't open doors.

01:05:30.112 --> 01:05:31.909
They mastered space flight,

01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:34.048
but they can't get
through a wooden door?

01:05:34.049 --> 01:05:36.185
Oh, look, the cellar's
the safest place.

01:05:36.186 --> 01:05:38.166
Women and children stay here.

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:40.147
- Ugh!
- All right, and the men,

01:05:40.148 --> 01:05:41.606
we go outside and fight.

01:05:41.607 --> 01:05:44.318
Right. And what's
the cutoff age for children?

01:05:44.319 --> 01:05:45.830
Come on!

01:05:45.831 --> 01:05:47.342
[Groans]

01:05:58.708 --> 01:05:59.958
[Rustling]

01:05:59.959 --> 01:06:02.461
- [Shovel cocks]
- Follow me.

01:06:09.552 --> 01:06:10.803
[Tires screeching]

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.641
I'm sorry.

01:06:16.642 --> 01:06:19.145
I thought
I was hitting the brake.

01:06:19.249 --> 01:06:22.273
Now, we don't have to go
through insurance, do we?

01:06:22.274 --> 01:06:24.358
Mr. President,
what are you doing here?

01:06:24.359 --> 01:06:25.817
I'm looking for Cindy Campbell.

01:06:25.818 --> 01:06:28.320
She may hold the key
to defeating the aliens.

01:06:28.321 --> 01:06:32.491
Ah, good. The Air Force is here
with those new round planes.

01:06:33.638 --> 01:06:36.558
We don't have round planes, sir.

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:38.070
Oh, my God.

01:06:38.071 --> 01:06:39.582
Oh, my God.

01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:42.918
- [Hip-hop music plays]
- Wait. Do you hear that?

01:06:43.023 --> 01:06:45.421
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

01:06:45.422 --> 01:06:47.924
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

01:06:48.028 --> 01:06:51.260
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

01:06:52.511 --> 01:06:54.596
- Yo, what's up, George?
- C.J.!

01:06:54.597 --> 01:06:57.412
I told you the 'hood
always got your back.

01:06:57.413 --> 01:07:00.228
I got the boys with me.
Get out the car, man.

01:07:00.229 --> 01:07:01.166
Who we gonna shoot?

01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:02.521
Is y'all ready to go step?

01:07:02.626 --> 01:07:04.972
Let's go do this,
'cause I'm hyped right now!

01:07:04.973 --> 01:07:07.318
- Real hyped!
- You stepped on my shoe, bitch!

01:07:07.319 --> 01:07:08.361
Call me "bitch" again,

01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:11.593
and I'll park your truck
dead in your ass.

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:12.322
Damn, homey!

01:07:12.323 --> 01:07:14.824
- In the cornfield.
- They're coming!

01:07:14.825 --> 01:07:17.015
Me and my boys,
we gonna take care of this.

01:07:17.016 --> 01:07:18.371
Come on, let's go.

01:07:18.579 --> 01:07:20.664
Son, I'd bust
this shit right now.

01:07:20.665 --> 01:07:22.436
- Your mama!
- I got your number, homey.

01:07:22.437 --> 01:07:24.627
- We over here, y'all!
- He ain't gonna bust nothing.

01:07:24.628 --> 01:07:25.878
I got nuts bigger than him.

01:07:26.087 --> 01:07:29.005
Whoa, country-ass,
maple-syrup nigga.

01:07:29.006 --> 01:07:32.447
Yeah, you want some biscuits?
You want some biscuits?

01:07:33.698 --> 01:07:35.888
Get down!
Get down!

01:07:43.396 --> 01:07:45.481
I can't believe what I just saw.

01:07:45.482 --> 01:07:47.565
These men died
for their country.

01:07:47.566 --> 01:07:50.903
Send flowers
to their bitches and hos.

01:07:55.387 --> 01:07:57.471
I can't break free!

01:07:57.472 --> 01:08:01.330
Think! They must have
some kind of weakness.

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.970
- Huh?
- Huh?

01:08:05.971 --> 01:08:06.961
I found it!

01:08:07.065 --> 01:08:09.046
Without their heads,
they're powerless!

01:08:09.047 --> 01:08:10.922
Please, no.
We mean you no harm.

01:08:10.923 --> 01:08:13.843
We traveled to your planet
to find an evil little girl.

01:08:13.947 --> 01:08:16.919
We must destroy her
before seven days.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.890
You mean you watched
the videotape?

01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:22.497
Our satellite picked up what
we thought was "Pootie Tang."

01:08:22.497 --> 01:08:23.853
That was a week ago.

01:08:24.062 --> 01:08:29.274
And now our entire race will die
unless the girl is destroyed.

01:08:29.379 --> 01:08:32.402
Oh, see?
They are peaceful.

01:08:32.403 --> 01:08:35.531
If they're so peaceful,
why were they choking us?

01:08:35.635 --> 01:08:37.669
Oh, that's how we say hello.

01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:39.702
- Hello!
- Nice to see you.

01:08:39.703 --> 01:08:41.786
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:08:41.787 --> 01:08:43.769
Well, how do you guys
say goodbye?

01:08:43.872 --> 01:08:45.122
Oh!

01:08:45.124 --> 01:08:47.834
[Groans]
I had to ask.

01:08:47.835 --> 01:08:52.944
If you think that's strange,
you should see how we pee.

01:08:52.944 --> 01:08:55.447
[Choking]

01:08:58.679 --> 01:09:02.225
So we're not so different
after all.

01:09:04.727 --> 01:09:06.707
There's something
about this place.

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:09.314
It's like I've seen it before.

01:09:11.192 --> 01:09:13.069
Oh, my God.

01:09:16.613 --> 01:09:18.698
This used to be their farm.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.576
She died right here.

01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:37.572
There's something down there.

01:09:48.104 --> 01:09:49.772
Ugh!

01:10:01.450 --> 01:10:05.204
Hey, awesome.
Yeah, you got it.

01:10:05.205 --> 01:10:06.351
Just look at this.

01:10:06.456 --> 01:10:09.792
Human beings and aliens
working together.

01:10:09.896 --> 01:10:13.337
We're all just
one big galactic family.

01:10:13.338 --> 01:10:15.213
Family.

01:10:15.214 --> 01:10:17.300
That's just what
I've been running away from.

01:10:17.301 --> 01:10:20.636
Well, that's because
you're an idiot.

01:10:30.437 --> 01:10:32.522
This is it.

01:10:32.523 --> 01:10:34.713
ARCHITECT: My wife took her
to the family farm

01:10:34.714 --> 01:10:36.902
and drowned her in the well.

01:10:40.239 --> 01:10:45.244
The little girl.
She's frightened of the well.

01:10:48.372 --> 01:10:49.832
[Gasps]

01:11:03.075 --> 01:11:04.325
Aah!

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:06.933
- Ugh!
- Cindy!

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:11.312
[Crowbar clanks]

01:11:20.592 --> 01:11:23.512
[Chainsaw sputters, buzzes]

01:11:44.053 --> 01:11:46.347
Time to go back
down the well, bitch.

01:11:46.348 --> 01:11:48.120
[Growling]

01:11:48.121 --> 01:11:49.891
Cindy!

01:11:49.892 --> 01:11:52.812
No.
Don't hurt him!

01:11:53.646 --> 01:11:55.209
Cindy, come outside.

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:56.878
- The aliens aren't invading.
- Aah!

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.546
Aah!

01:11:58.547 --> 01:12:00.319
Don't worry, Cody.
I'll save you.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.300
- Aah!
- CINDY: Wait!

01:12:02.301 --> 01:12:04.281
Wait.
Don't do this.

01:12:04.282 --> 01:12:06.575
You don't have to be evil.

01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:11.163
I know what happened
to you, Tabitha.

01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:15.334
I know what your mom did.
That was wrong.

01:12:15.335 --> 01:12:17.001
You were just a little girl.

01:12:17.002 --> 01:12:21.173
You're still that little girl,
just a lot more corpsy

01:12:21.174 --> 01:12:23.676
and with really bad teeth.

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:27.847
But maybe all you need
is a mother.

01:12:31.392 --> 01:12:33.269
And a father.

01:12:45.781 --> 01:12:47.241
We could be...

01:12:47.345 --> 01:12:49.431
A family.

01:12:54.019 --> 01:12:55.791
Thank you all.

01:12:55.791 --> 01:12:59.336
Your love has broken the curse
and freed my soul.

01:12:59.337 --> 01:13:01.109
I'll never have to kill again.

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.777
Really?

01:13:02.882 --> 01:13:06.636
Nah!
I'm just screwing with you!

01:13:06.637 --> 01:13:08.720
[Grunts]
Aah!

01:13:08.721 --> 01:13:10.702
I just want to tell you both
good luck.

01:13:10.703 --> 01:13:12.683
- We're all counting on you.
- [Splash]

01:13:21.650 --> 01:13:23.006
Now it's over.

01:13:23.007 --> 01:13:24.362
- [Gasps]
- Aah!

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:26.134
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:27.697
He's our friend.

01:13:27.698 --> 01:13:29.783
Thank you for saving
our species.

01:13:29.784 --> 01:13:31.661
Now we must return
to our home planet.

01:13:31.869 --> 01:13:33.120
Goodbye, then.

01:13:33.121 --> 01:13:34.059
Ugh!

01:13:34.163 --> 01:13:35.727
Goodbye.

01:13:54.392 --> 01:13:56.894
Hey, congratulations, George!

01:13:56.895 --> 01:13:58.771
You know the 'hood
always got your back.

01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:00.439
Yeah, yeah!

01:14:00.544 --> 01:14:02.003
Come on!

01:14:06.279 --> 01:14:07.686
Bye!

01:14:07.687 --> 01:14:09.093
Whoo!

01:14:09.094 --> 01:14:11.075
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:14:21.502 --> 01:14:23.275
ALL: Bye!

01:14:23.379 --> 01:14:25.986
Oh, George, I'm so happy.

01:14:25.987 --> 01:14:28.958
Finally we're a family.

01:14:28.958 --> 01:14:31.929
Yeah.
You, me, and...

01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:32.764
- Damn!
- Damn!

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:35.005
[Tires screeching]

01:14:35.006 --> 01:14:37.143
Cindy, George, wait!

01:14:39.854 --> 01:14:42.043
[Sighs]

01:14:43.607 --> 01:14:44.859
<i>Come on</i>

<i>You think you hot shit 'cause

<i>When he spoke,
his voice pitch</i>

01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.248
<i>My first thought's
to slap him up, but I'm grown</i>

01:14:59.353 --> 01:15:00.916
<i>So I dropped a jewel
in his ear</i>

01:15:00.917 --> 01:15:02.479
<i>Told him get on,
leave it alone</i>

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.879
<i>Now he's asking questions he
shoulda asked from the start</i>

01:15:04.983 --> 01:15:07.484
<i>I'm gonna spit from the
heart, spit till it's dark</i>

01:15:07.485 --> 01:15:09.675
<i>From the stage in the park,
I'm gonna bite if you bark</i>

01:15:09.676 --> 01:15:11.551
<i>Just to show him
that it's fun to me</i>

01:15:11.552 --> 01:15:13.742
<i>And take a look at what
being broke gonna mean</i>

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:16.139
<i>I am the truth,
plus I'm hungry</i>

01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:18.538
<i>Heads or tail, playboy,

01:15:18.539 --> 01:15:20.884
<i>You cannot escape your fate
