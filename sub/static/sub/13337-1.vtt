WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.200
.

00:07.400 --> 00:10.040
Last time around,
things were absolutely insane.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.440
(cheering)

00:12.920 --> 00:14.640
It was fucking crackers!

00:14.720 --> 00:16.520
(shouting)

00:17.680 --> 00:20.600
We got two new members of
the family, Nathan and Chloe,

00:20.680 --> 00:23.320
and they completely shook
everything up.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.680
I need to leave here.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.280
James left the house
and we're sad to see him go.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.760
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you too.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.840
Me and Scott did have sex.
(screams)

00:32.920 --> 00:34.840
I can't believe I've had sex with ya.

00:34.920 --> 00:38.120
Marnie's sharing her boyfriend
with Aaron.

00:38.200 --> 00:42.040
She'd fucking suck off a dog
if she was married to a cat. (sobs)

00:42.920 --> 00:46.480
Surprise, surprise, Gary broke
Charlotte's heart all over again.

00:46.560 --> 00:47.880
I've met someone else.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.840
Kyle finally asked Holly
to be his girlfriend.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.520
I want you as me lass.
Yes!

00:57.600 --> 01:01.680
Not gonna lie, it's difficult...
(cries)

01:01.760 --> 01:03.440
...but I'm glad I've got her.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.400
The Geordies are back,

01:07.480 --> 01:10.200
and we're leaving the Toon
and hitting Greece.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.800
Greece, you're about to get done.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.640
(cheering)

01:14.720 --> 01:16.200
Come on!

01:17.640 --> 01:19.240
It's gonna be pool party...

01:19.320 --> 01:21.800
Boat parties...
(cheering)

01:21.880 --> 01:23.000
More drama...

01:24.400 --> 01:25.720
Fuck this shit!

01:27.560 --> 01:28.680
More tashing on...

01:31.560 --> 01:33.080
More fucking tragedy...

01:33.160 --> 01:35.440
(yelling)
Slag!

01:36.920 --> 01:38.520
(exhales deeply)

01:38.600 --> 01:41.040
Don't fucking ever speak to me again.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.760
Total carnage.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.640
Fuck! Shit! What have I done now?

01:53.880 --> 01:55.680
And a shit load of fucking, like.

01:58.800 --> 02:03.360
Greece, the Geordie Gods are coming.
Time to get immortal.

02:04.520 --> 02:05.920
(laughter)

02:07.680 --> 02:09.880
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.320
I've never kissed anyone
without a six pack.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.760
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.040
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.120
I'm totally crackers me, like.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.000
I'm preened to perfection.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.000
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:23.080 --> 02:25.200
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double F's.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.960
I'm gonna make sparks fly
and get everyone feisty.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.960
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:35.880 --> 02:38.240
Since last time,
the crew have been on a break

02:38.320 --> 02:42.120
so it's time to get the squad back
together cos we're off to Greece.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.400
What do you think?
Have you died your hair?

02:46.480 --> 02:47.560
Is it nice?

02:47.640 --> 02:50.280
Kyle has come out
and it's like a new man.

02:50.360 --> 02:53.040
He doesn't look like a Barbie,
he looks like Ken.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.480
Let's get some clothes on,
get packed and...

02:57.120 --> 02:58.680
'We're heading to Greece.'

02:58.760 --> 03:00.920
That's class,
cos I look like a Greek God.

03:02.440 --> 03:05.720
Kyle and Holly are no more.
It's now Xena and Zeus.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.400
(Nathan) Let's go!

03:09.480 --> 03:14.000
I normally hate going to work,
but with the sun and the parties...

03:14.080 --> 03:16.320
The sea...
It's gonna be so much better.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.160
I've got meself
a new boyfriend called Ricky,

03:19.240 --> 03:21.920
but that is not gonna stop me
having a wicked time.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.120
I can't fucking wait.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.440
Get to the airport, get on
the fucking plane and get to Greece.

03:26.520 --> 03:30.480
We're gonna get fucking mortal in the
land of the immortals. Bring it on!

03:33.960 --> 03:35.160
What's the rules?

03:38.040 --> 03:40.000
Greece is the home of kebabs.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.520
I can have kebabs for breakfast,
lunch, dinner, supper.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.960
What a belter!

03:45.040 --> 03:48.000
Where is she?
Hello, you motherfuckers!

03:48.080 --> 03:49.120
Hi!
Hi!

03:49.200 --> 03:51.640
Hi! Where've ya been?
We've been waiting?

03:51.720 --> 03:54.600
Oh, I've been having a turd.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.240
Whoa, this is awks!

03:56.320 --> 04:00.160
Last time, she arrived five minutes
after me, stealing my limelight.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.760
This time, she's wearing the same
bloody outfit. What a bitch!

04:03.840 --> 04:05.920
Are you excited?
Yeah, are you? Yeah.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.680
It's my first holiday!

04:07.760 --> 04:10.680
Now that me and my favourite girls
are back together,

04:10.760 --> 04:13.520
I can't wait to get to Greece
and see the others.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.320
I'm so excited to go to Greece.
I have never been before.

04:19.400 --> 04:22.840
But I'm back with Mitch and I'm not
gonna lie, I am gonna miss him.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
To Greece. To Greece.
We're going to goddamn Greece.

04:29.080 --> 04:31.040
Whoo! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

04:32.360 --> 04:33.600
Go! Go! Go! Go!

04:33.680 --> 04:37.040
The Geordie lads
are coming to Greece. Come on!

04:37.120 --> 04:39.640
It's gonna be like
one massive summer holiday.

04:39.720 --> 04:42.640
I haven't seen Gaz
since we last left the house.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.400
He's been with Lillie 24/7.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.480
(both laugh)

04:52.560 --> 04:56.280
Greece is like putting me in a candy
shop with fucking handcuffs on.

04:57.760 --> 05:02.360
I'm buzzing me. I'm Scottie Turbos,
god of seeking and banging fanny.

05:07.200 --> 05:11.280
What better way to kick things off
than pre-flight beers with the boys?

05:17.240 --> 05:18.800
Hopefully this will be like,

05:18.880 --> 05:22.640
you've got a boyfriend, I've got a
girlfriend, let's just have a laugh.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.120
We've got no reason not to.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.720
I just hope that Charlotte
doesn't kick off like last time

05:27.800 --> 05:29.640
cos that was a fucking nightmare.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.960
All right...
It's time. Let's hit Greece.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.520
Let's neck these drinks
and get on this plane,

05:35.600 --> 05:37.920
cos it takes ages
to get through security.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.160
They think my dick
is a fucking grenade launcher.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.640
My God, it's hot.
It's so warm.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.920
Go on then.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.920
I'm single and I'm ready to mingle.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.360
Send them Greek fuckers
to Chloe's nipple.

06:01.840 --> 06:05.440
This is like the desert of Greece.
They are rotten fucking trees.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.880
(all exclaim)

06:08.960 --> 06:11.240
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, there's a pool!

06:13.120 --> 06:16.000
Shit. This is unreal.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.600
We rock to up the villa,
it's like a palace.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.520
Oh, my God.
I feel dead classy, like a princess.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.160
Right, who wants to go first?
Me!

06:24.240 --> 06:27.480
Oh, my God!
This is unreal.

06:32.320 --> 06:36.560
This villa is unbelievable. I can't
wait to see what else there is.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.720
This is the shag pad I'll be in
100 percent of the time.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.000
This shag pad's mint.

06:41.080 --> 06:44.240
We're gonna be fighting over
who gets to bang in it first.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.560
Oh, yeah!
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

06:46.640 --> 06:49.640
This is amazing.
For once, Anna got it right.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.760
If I was staying in this bedroom,
I'd have this one.Why?

06:52.840 --> 06:55.080
Cos I'm a ballerina.
I'll be this one.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.280
What the fuck am I?
I'm a fucking horse!

06:57.360 --> 07:00.160
Enough messing around.
Let's get the drinks flowing.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.720
Drink, drink, drink, drink...

07:03.440 --> 07:06.880
How do yous feel about seeing Scott?
Are you gonna go there again?

07:06.960 --> 07:10.680
I'm gonna try not to. You might give
a better blow job this time.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.560
I give Scott me first ever blowy.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.680
This time,
I'm gonna try to stay away.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.400
Because of your mouth?

07:22.480 --> 07:24.920
Your banjo snaps during sex,
not a blow job.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.840
'I cannot believe
that Chloe's got worse at blow jobs.'

07:29.920 --> 07:33.760
Any lad that puts his dick
in her mouth might not get it back.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.680
(laughter)

07:37.800 --> 07:39.240
Fucking hell.
Oi! Oi!

07:39.320 --> 07:42.040
'Fuck me,
this is a crib and a half.'

07:42.120 --> 07:45.000
I hope it's got plenty of rooms
to do some dusting in.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.520
This is sick. Yo!

07:47.600 --> 07:49.720
(all) Hi!

07:50.400 --> 07:52.200
Scott is looking fucking mint,

07:52.280 --> 07:55.600
but this time I'm gonna try
my hardest not to go there.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.520
Oh, my good God, this is amazing!

07:58.600 --> 08:00.800
Nathan shows us the lad's bedroom

08:00.880 --> 08:03.000
and there's a massive pool table
in it.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.160
It gives Kyle and Gaz
something to do

08:05.240 --> 08:08.680
while they're talking about
their birds and fucking feelings.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.480
Boys!
Boys! (whistles)

08:12.920 --> 08:16.760
We're fucking in Greece, so let's
fucking say "Oi, Oi" and get fucked.

08:16.840 --> 08:19.600
(cheering)
Don't the Greeks say "woopah"?!

08:21.040 --> 08:22.240
No. No.
Yeah, they do!

08:22.320 --> 08:24.160
(laughter)
Yes, they do!

08:27.040 --> 08:32.000
These guys are thick as shit. How
do they not know what "woopah" is?

08:32.080 --> 08:33.520
Taxi!

08:33.600 --> 08:36.320
(Kyle)Fuck me.
Me and Holly rock up to the villa

08:36.400 --> 08:39.640
and it's fucking class.
This is gonna be mint.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.520
Kyle, love your hair.
(Marnie)It's very dark.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.040
I don't know what Kyle's
done to his hair.

08:45.120 --> 08:49.400
Looks like he's replaced his shampoo
with marmite, and I hate marmite.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.520
It's always a good first night.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.040
I'm excited.
We're gonna go fucking nuts!

08:54.120 --> 08:56.960
'It is so nice
to actually see everyone again.'

08:57.040 --> 08:58.720
The family is back together.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.600
I'm getting mortal!
And we're not gonna argue.

09:01.680 --> 09:04.640
Last time in the house,
Holly and Kyle were draining.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.880
They argued so much. I don't
want that to happen this time.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.160
(screams)

09:10.240 --> 09:11.680
Who's that?
Who's that?

09:11.760 --> 09:14.040
Charlotte.
Hi, everybody!

09:14.120 --> 09:15.560
(all) Hi!

09:15.640 --> 09:17.240
It's so good to see everyone.

09:17.320 --> 09:20.760
We're haven't all been together
for ages. This is gonna be good.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.720
Are yous drunk yet?

09:22.800 --> 09:24.880
Hi, Gary.
Hello.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.640
How are ya?
Good.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.000
Why would hugging Charlotte
be awkward?

09:29.080 --> 09:31.200
Because she made my life
a living hell.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.440
Everyone knows
how to start the party in Greece.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.960
I fucking told yous! Woopah!
One, two, three!

09:38.040 --> 09:41.240
Woopah!
(cheering

09:41.320 --> 09:44.280
'Charlotte's smashing plates
already.'

09:44.360 --> 09:46.520
Fuck me,
Gaz hasn't even said anything.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.320
Now the party's started,
do you wanna go get ready?

09:49.400 --> 09:51.920
Whoo!
What are you doing?!

09:52.000 --> 09:54.720
I've just jumped in the pool
and I can't even swim.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.800
So what? I'm radge as fuck.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.720
She can't swim! She can't swim!

09:58.800 --> 10:00.560
Can she not?
No.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.200
'What? Who doesn't know
how to swim?'

10:03.280 --> 10:05.320
Even sperm can swim.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.640
(laughter)

10:20.280 --> 10:23.960
I think it's gonna be girls on top
this time around.I do as well.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.520
Us girls haven't seen each other
in ages,

10:26.600 --> 10:29.000
so it's time for a catch up
and a gossip.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.280
How's you and Kyle?
We're actually really, really good.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.560
I just find meself
constantly on his face. (laughter)

10:35.640 --> 10:39.840
The sex between me and Kyle is
getting better and better with time.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.240
How are you and Mitch?

10:42.320 --> 10:44.960
Well, I've got his initial
tattooed on me arm.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.080
Me and Mitch are so serious,

10:47.160 --> 10:49.760
I got his initial
tattooed on the back of me arm.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.680
I'm actually thinking about
getting it removed.Why?

10:52.760 --> 10:54.320
From a distance,

10:54.400 --> 10:58.520
it just looks like someone's
drew lines on me arm with a compass.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.720
How's it gonna be with you
and Aaron? Fine. We're friends.

11:01.800 --> 11:05.840
Marnie's in a new relationship,
and this time it's serious.

11:05.920 --> 11:09.080
The kind of serious where she
doesn't cheat on him with Aaron.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.600
(laughs)

11:10.680 --> 11:13.760
What's happening then?
Cos I don't know much about it.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.320
Well, he's really nice.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.480
I not going anywhere near Aaron,

11:17.560 --> 11:20.040
and I can't wait to prove
everyone wrong.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.200
I will stay faithful
to me boyfriend.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.400
Chloe, how you feeling about Scott?

11:26.720 --> 11:29.360
(laughs)
Do you wanna go there with him?

11:34.160 --> 11:37.600
I do really, really like Scott,
but I don't wanna get hurt again.

11:37.680 --> 11:41.000
You haven't got the willpower
when you've had a drink.I know.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.880
Right, OK.
'Good luck, Chloe.'

11:44.960 --> 11:47.560
May as well get your pyjamas
in the shag pad now.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.680
OK, I'm excited. Let's all go out.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.760
(cheering)
Best night ever! Yeah!

11:59.320 --> 12:01.760
I'm that excited
for me first night in Zante,

12:01.840 --> 12:04.840
I've got discharge in my knickers.
Disco discharge!

12:10.600 --> 12:12.520
Tonight's gonna be berserk,

12:12.600 --> 12:16.200
cos it's the first time fucking
yous three have even been away.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.680
I'm buzzing
for me first night out in Zante,

12:18.760 --> 12:21.000
but it's family night,
so no pulling.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.320
That won't stop me
from enjoying meself.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.960
Let's actually just go out,
everyone together,

12:26.040 --> 12:28.040
let's go out
and smash fucking Zante!

12:28.120 --> 12:30.360
First night out,
let's get fucking mortal

12:30.440 --> 12:32.240
before Anna makes us do some work.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.560
Zante! Zante! Zante!

12:37.640 --> 12:39.640
(cheering)

12:39.720 --> 12:42.400
I'm absolutely buzzing my dick off
for tonight.

12:42.480 --> 12:45.560
We've got the full family
and we're gonna go ballistic.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.000
(all) Zante! Zante! Zante!

12:55.960 --> 12:59.640
We've hit the Zante strip
and it's time to get mortal.

13:00.920 --> 13:04.280
Plates aren't the only thing
getting smashed tonight, we are.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.760
Smashed to smithereens.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.760
(cheering)

13:09.440 --> 13:12.320
I'm just so happy
that the family is back together.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.600
This is gonna be one of
the best holidays I've ever had.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.720
Look, look, look.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.400
We've been here for two minutes
and Scott and Chloe are flirting.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.000
She needs to be careful.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.280
(laughs)
Moo!

13:31.360 --> 13:35.240
Scott's looking canny, but I'm not
gonna show that I'm interested

13:35.320 --> 13:36.880
cos I don't wanna get hurt.

13:39.640 --> 13:43.480
I used to dance like a dick, but
now I sit back cool as a cucumber

13:43.560 --> 13:48.080
thinking, "Yeah, babe, I'm fucking
good" and let the lads come to you.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.760
Would ya?
(cheering)

13:58.920 --> 14:02.520
We actually all look like
we're a fucking family.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.320
Holly and Kyle
are looking so loved up,

14:10.400 --> 14:13.160
and if they keep this up
for the rest of the holiday,

14:13.240 --> 14:15.520
the world will literally be perfect.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.720
Make me!

14:19.960 --> 14:20.960
(squeals)

14:21.040 --> 14:23.160
I'm having such a wicked night
with Kyle

14:23.240 --> 14:26.040
and I can't wait to shag him
in the pool tonight.

14:29.720 --> 14:34.760
I don't know what's in this Greek
alcohol, but I fucking love it!

14:39.720 --> 14:42.240
Don't we? Marnie, you do!
Yeah. Yeah.

14:42.320 --> 14:46.160
Charlotte is fucking mortal. I
haven't seen her like this in ages.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.760
At least she likes Greece.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.400
(laughter)

14:53.880 --> 14:56.720
'Charlotte's got her tits out
in the club.'

14:56.800 --> 14:58.360
Zante, meet Charlotte.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.720
Eh! How the hell
is Charlotte so drunk,

15:03.800 --> 15:06.560
and why the fuck am I
not on the same level?

15:06.640 --> 15:08.960
(groans)

15:09.040 --> 15:11.440
Zante! Zante! Zante!

15:11.520 --> 15:14.440
I've got a girlfriend
and Charlotte's got a boyfriend,

15:14.520 --> 15:16.800
why am I still
picking her up off the floor

15:16.880 --> 15:19.960
when she's fucking smashed?
Some things never change.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.160
Why?

15:33.800 --> 15:36.280
Scott is already trying
to work his charm.

15:36.360 --> 15:40.080
That wouldn't work with me, but
I can see Chloe's fanny fluttering.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.360
You never know.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.480
I say...
(cheering)

15:47.560 --> 15:51.200
Oh, shit! Scott keeps flirting
with us, and I've got to be honest,

15:51.280 --> 15:54.840
I fucking love it! I can't believe
this is happening again.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.760
Chloe needs to stay away from Scott
this time around.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.240
It only ever ends in tears.

16:14.240 --> 16:18.000
Holly's right. If Chloe gets with
Scott again, she's gonna regret it.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.480
(cheering)

16:20.600 --> 16:22.720
Tonight's been absolutely amazing,

16:22.800 --> 16:25.400
but we're all shit-faced
so it's home time!

16:26.200 --> 16:27.760
Come on!

16:38.120 --> 16:40.720
We're in the taxi
and we're absolutely mortal.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.440
This is a great time to find out
how Scott really feels about Chloe.

16:44.520 --> 16:48.200
I heard that you wanted
to get into Chloe and nobody else.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.280
I want to get into Chloe.

16:50.360 --> 16:53.120
If I haven't pulled
and Chloe's up for a bang,

16:53.200 --> 16:55.600
then what the fuck's
wrong with that? Nowt!

16:57.720 --> 17:02.120
So, if I see... If I see you flirting
with her and you leading her on,

17:02.200 --> 17:04.280
I'm gonna say fuck off because...

17:04.360 --> 17:07.080
Why are you bothered, Holly?
At the end of the day,

17:07.160 --> 17:10.040
you will hurt that girl
and it won't be nice for her.

17:10.120 --> 17:12.320
She's 19, you should know better.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.720
Scott is being completely out of
order speaking about Chloe.

17:15.800 --> 17:19.600
You shouldn't treat girls like that.
I can't help but voice my opinion.

17:23.600 --> 17:27.400
Chloe's the one...
OK, all right. Right, yeah.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.360
'What the fuck? Now Kyle's jumping in
and taking his side.'

17:32.440 --> 17:35.800
I know that he agrees with me,
and this is completely fucked up.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.600
You! Fucking little prick.

17:37.680 --> 17:40.280
Don't fucking start.
What ya on about?

17:40.360 --> 17:41.640
Oh, fuck off.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.560
We haven't even been back a day
and we're arguing. What the fuck?

17:45.640 --> 17:48.400
How dare you? How fucking dare you?

17:53.120 --> 17:54.240
(indistinct)

17:54.320 --> 17:56.680
We get back
and everyone is fucked.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.120
I don't know why
we didn't get a kebab.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.440
We're in Greece,
what's wrong with us?

18:08.920 --> 18:10.720
Holly's such a good best friend,

18:10.800 --> 18:14.360
telling me that I'm the only person
she's loved in this house.

18:14.440 --> 18:18.320
Shit, Kyle, pretty big pie
you just got there, mate.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.920
Is that what she said?

18:25.000 --> 18:28.280
Holly has told me on numerous
occasions that she loves me.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.960
For her to turn around and say that
she's only ever loved Charlotte

18:32.040 --> 18:34.560
is a massive kick
in the fucking balls.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.400
Why?

18:43.480 --> 18:46.400
'Holly has embarrassed me
in front of the whole house.'

18:46.480 --> 18:48.600
If I had said that, I'd be castrated

18:48.680 --> 18:51.040
and exiled to live
in the fucking garden.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.920
Yeah, you go to bed. See ya later.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Love you, right?

18:56.080 --> 18:57.600
Holly, I love you.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.120
I know I'm being childish,

18:59.200 --> 19:02.000
but I don't want anything to do
with Kyle right now.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.560
Everybody loves a toilet party!

19:07.120 --> 19:09.600
My holiday is going great.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.920
I'm naked, I'm mortal,

19:12.000 --> 19:15.760
and I might even make it through
the night without weeing meself.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.200
What a success.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.800
We're having a wicked night,

19:23.880 --> 19:27.040
but me and Chloe aren't ready
for bed yet, so we go upstairs.

19:31.080 --> 19:34.200
What's going on? Chloe's all over us
like a dog on heat.

19:34.280 --> 19:35.600
Chloe, Chloe. Sit!

19:37.400 --> 19:41.280
Me and Scott are lying in bed
having a bit of a flirt on. Buzzing!

19:41.360 --> 19:43.320
(indistinct chatter)

19:45.680 --> 19:47.560
Shit, I have got a bit carried away.

19:47.640 --> 19:51.440
We've already kissed,
it's only the first night. Fuck!

19:51.520 --> 19:54.520
(indistinct)
Girls, girls...

19:54.600 --> 19:55.840
Bye!

19:55.920 --> 19:58.880
I've had a fucking wicked
first night in Greece,

19:58.960 --> 20:02.560
but I'm absolutely mortal drunk,
me and Chloe are going to bed.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.680
I know Holly's pissed off
about what happened,

20:12.760 --> 20:15.960
but there's ney point
talking about it cos she's mortal.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.200
You did, and you're pissing me off.
You're supposed to be on my side.

20:39.960 --> 20:44.000
Here we are,
falling out on the first night.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.600
Kyle's walking away, for fuck's sake!

20:51.680 --> 20:54.880
I don't believe you,
you fucking two-faced bastard.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.520
(screams)

20:59.840 --> 21:01.960
Fuck off, you fucking little prick!

21:02.040 --> 21:05.000
Holly is going pure psycho mode.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.320
I have done nothing wrong tonight.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.400
You fucking prick!

21:17.280 --> 21:19.520
'I'm so fucked off with Kyle.'

21:19.600 --> 21:23.040
I can see him laughing at me,
and I'm so fucking embarrassed.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.920
So I'm chasing after him
like a fucking banshee.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.240
He's a fucking dick.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.520
Fuck me, Holly's coming at us
with a pool cue.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.040
She's about to take me head
fucking clean off.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.560
Holly, you're taking this
a bit too far.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.320
Put the cue down.

21:46.400 --> 21:51.040
You fucking prick!
Fucking laughing at me!

21:51.120 --> 21:53.640
You're a fucking prick, man!
Whoa!

21:53.720 --> 21:55.720
Don't fucking speak to us like that!

21:55.800 --> 21:59.280
When your night out results in you
chasing your lad with a pool cue,

21:59.360 --> 22:00.680
something's not right.

22:00.760 --> 22:03.920
Holly. Holly, breathe.
(hysterical sobbing)

22:04.000 --> 22:06.880
Holly, calm down.
(indistinct screaming)

22:06.960 --> 22:09.640
I thought Holly and Kyle
were a happy couple now,

22:09.720 --> 22:12.440
but they haven't made it one day
without arguing.

22:12.520 --> 22:15.200
'What the fuck
could possibly have happened?'

22:21.280 --> 22:23.440
I cannot be dealing with this
all summer.

22:23.520 --> 22:26.760
Holly, sit down.
I'm gonna get Kyle, sit him down,

22:26.840 --> 22:29.600
and you're gonna
sort this shit out right now.

22:31.280 --> 22:34.480
Genuinely, I thought
we were gonna be all right.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.600
I thought
we were gonna be all right.

22:36.680 --> 22:40.080
We were fine until we got in that
taxi.Until we got in the taxi.

22:40.160 --> 22:43.680
I'm too pissed and I'm too knackered
to sort this out right now.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.160
'I just wanna go to bed.'

22:50.480 --> 22:53.200
'Kyle's left me to go and sleep
in the boys' room.'

22:53.280 --> 22:55.680
This is not how I wanted
this night to end.

23:16.160 --> 23:19.640
This morning, I'm so upset
that me and Kyle ended up arguing.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.440
I hope that this was a one-off.

23:21.520 --> 23:24.400
It was a good first night though.
It was shit.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.920
Was it?

23:27.520 --> 23:29.120
I smashed the house up.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.480
It seems like not everyone
had a fantastic night like me.

23:32.560 --> 23:35.520
Holly smashed the house up
and argued with Kyle.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.880
This isn't a good start.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.760
It's like, I wanna be with him
and I love him to bits.

23:40.840 --> 23:44.920
But we came in saying that we're this
perfect couple and we're fucking not.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.640
If Holly and Kyle are already
arguing after the first night,

23:48.720 --> 23:51.480
God knows what the rest of our time
is gonna be like.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.800
No matter what happens
with you and Kyle,

23:53.880 --> 23:56.800
me and you
are going off it in Greece.Yeah.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.480
(groaning)

24:04.560 --> 24:06.400
I wake up and from what I remember,

24:06.480 --> 24:09.440
our first night in Zante
kind of went off with a bang.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.480
After last night,
I am dreading seeing Holly today.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.800
That scream that she done...
Like someone wanking off a pig.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.000
(laughs)

24:21.080 --> 24:24.720
She's like a wild animal, screaming
like a pig getting wanked off.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.560
Kyle! Kyle!

24:26.640 --> 24:30.040
First night out, her letting out
that much fucking steam,

24:30.120 --> 24:31.520
something's not right.

24:31.600 --> 24:35.640
You need to talk with her today
whether yous both like it or not.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.040
Talk to her
and get it fucking sorted.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.800
We can't have Holly and Kyle
arguing every night

24:40.880 --> 24:44.000
and spoiling our time in Greece.
They need to sort it out.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.560
You know what I don't understand,
though?

24:48.640 --> 24:50.960
You said you didn't care
about Chloe at all.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.760
Did anything happen last night?

24:52.840 --> 24:56.160
She got on me bed and she got
on top of us and she was like...

24:56.240 --> 24:58.960
After all that, you kissed her.
Yeah, but...

24:59.040 --> 25:00.720
(laughter)
You kissed her!

25:00.800 --> 25:02.640
When a man's lying half naked

25:02.720 --> 25:04.960
and a bird jumps on top of us
and kisses us,

25:05.040 --> 25:06.560
what am I meant to do? Say no?

25:06.640 --> 25:08.880
I didn't go,
"Come here, I want a kiss".

25:08.960 --> 25:10.240
But you kissed her back.

25:10.320 --> 25:13.000
That doesn't mean anything.
What's that mean?

25:13.080 --> 25:15.200
That kiss might not
mean a lot to you,

25:15.280 --> 25:17.960
but I bet Chloe
doesn't feel the same.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.320
Are you awake?

25:19.400 --> 25:20.640
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.

25:20.720 --> 25:24.360
I've woke up in bed with Chloe and
to be honest, I'm a bit surprised.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.440
I thought how pissed she got,
she'd be in bed with Scott.

25:27.520 --> 25:30.760
I'm really proud of you
for staying away from Scott.

25:30.840 --> 25:34.320
You kissed him and you got outta
the bed and you didn't shag him.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.920
Yeah, I know.
That's playing hard to get.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.400
Is it? Shit!

25:38.480 --> 25:40.440
I love having a laugh with Scott,

25:40.520 --> 25:43.040
but when I'm pissed,
I wanna snog his face off.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.800
Try and be strong
for the rest of the time as well

25:45.880 --> 25:49.960
because if you do, he'll just chase
you. That's what you want.I know.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.920
After last night,
everybody is hanging.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.800
We need one day to recover
and get back on it tonight.

26:01.680 --> 26:02.720
Who's it for?

26:02.800 --> 26:04.680
So far, Greece has been pure mint.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.920
If getting pissed and destroying
this villa is our job,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.200
Anna couldn't have picked
a better crew.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.880
I'd volunteer for overtime.

26:16.920 --> 26:19.280
Excuse me!
Anna!

26:19.360 --> 26:21.240
What the fuck? Anna's here!

26:21.320 --> 26:23.520
What the hell has happened here?

26:25.280 --> 26:27.480
Shit! I haven't even
tidied up the house

26:27.560 --> 26:31.040
from where I've smashed the fucking
place up, and now Anna's here.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.400
'I'm gonna get a bollocking.'

26:33.480 --> 26:35.160
Who's responsible for this?

26:35.240 --> 26:37.080
It was me. I'm sorry.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.960
Fuck's sake.
I do not envy Holly right now.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.400
Do I need to remind you,
this is not a holiday.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.120
If this doesn't get cleaned up,

26:44.200 --> 26:46.680
you're on your first flight
back to Newcastle.

26:46.760 --> 26:48.960
Yeah, I'll clean it up.
It was my fault.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.720
Anna's telling us
that we're not here for holiday.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.200
So what is she doing
sending us to Greece?

26:54.280 --> 26:57.760
The fucking dafty. So we can
check out the local monuments?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.960
Well, Tash-On Tours is going Greek.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.200
You've got your first job tonight.

27:05.280 --> 27:10.400
Charlotte, Nathan and you, Gaz,
I want yous to work...

27:10.480 --> 27:14.680
'This is the first time me and
Charlotte have been together.'

27:14.760 --> 27:16.320
I just hope it goes well.

27:16.400 --> 27:20.120
I'll leave you with that, and
with the cleaning up as well. OK?

27:20.200 --> 27:22.360
Bye, Anna.
Bye, Anna! Bye.

27:22.440 --> 27:26.320
Me at work?! Anna fucking hates me.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.480
I've got a good mind to
push her in the pool on the way out.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.720
Stupid bitch!

27:43.360 --> 27:46.120
Me and Holly haven't spoken
about last night yet.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.320
I'm not looking forward to this.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.520
Yeah.

27:57.800 --> 28:01.360
Everybody else has fucked off
and left me to tidy up by myself,

28:01.440 --> 28:04.600
but luckily Kyle comes down
and wants to sort things out.

28:04.680 --> 28:07.000
I'd rather sort out our
mess than this one.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.880
We better start talking
about last night.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.360
In the taxi on the way back,
the things that I was saying

28:19.440 --> 28:22.360
you'd previously agreed with
about Scott and Chloe.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.040
Before we got in the taxi,

28:24.120 --> 28:27.200
Kyle had agreed with me
that Scott shouldn't use Chloe,

28:27.280 --> 28:31.160
but with Scott there, he was on his
side and it made me feel this big.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.080
It started off being about that,

28:33.160 --> 28:35.400
and then it turned to being
about us then.

28:35.480 --> 28:39.120
I don't wanna be arguing all the
time, but I do wanna be with Holly.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.520
I'll be honest with ya, I swear down
on fucking my mam's life,

28:42.600 --> 28:44.240
I didn't wanna argue with you,

28:44.320 --> 28:47.040
and that's why I didn't argue
until we got inside,

28:47.120 --> 28:50.160
and then Gary told us
what you said about the love thing,

28:50.240 --> 28:53.120
that Charlotte was the only one
you loved in the house.

28:53.200 --> 28:56.720
Last night, I was bang out of order
by saying that the only person

28:56.800 --> 28:59.120
I cared about in that house
was Charlotte.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.640
It's the first day
and it's already started.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.200
No, like... Don't worry.

29:03.280 --> 29:06.400
I'm gonna try my hardest
and do everything in my power...

29:06.480 --> 29:08.880
Yeah, but we do.
No, like last night,

29:08.960 --> 29:11.840
when you say stuff like that
I won't let it affect us.

29:11.920 --> 29:14.120
We need to make sure
that it was a one-off

29:14.200 --> 29:16.520
and there will be no more fights
in Greece.

29:16.600 --> 29:19.720
I think I need to massively watch
my drinking.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.600
And I'll try not to bring
other people's arguments

29:22.680 --> 29:24.160
into our relationship.

29:24.240 --> 29:26.920
Cos we have conflicting opinions.
Yeah.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.600
Yes, we argue, we fall out,
but we always come back together.

29:32.560 --> 29:35.040
I love you, you know.
I love you too.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.440
(horse whinnies)

29:43.320 --> 29:45.760
'The sun's out and it's boiling.'

29:45.840 --> 29:47.960
I'm gonna go from a milky latte

29:48.040 --> 29:51.640
to a triple espresso
chocolate cappuccino. Drink me!

29:51.720 --> 29:54.760
Who's ready for it?!
(laughter)

29:54.840 --> 29:58.840
What the fuck is she wearing?
Trust her to walk out like that.

29:58.920 --> 30:02.320
I can't believe we've got this
lush pool and I can't even swim.

30:02.400 --> 30:05.400
It's a good job I've got
these two buff lads to teach us.

30:05.480 --> 30:06.640
It's cold.

30:06.720 --> 30:08.880
'Chloe's come out
dressed like a kid.'

30:08.960 --> 30:11.640
She's going the wrong way
to impress these boys.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.280
Kick your legs out,
both legs at the same time.

30:14.360 --> 30:17.200
Imagine you're trying
to open doors, right...

30:17.280 --> 30:21.240
I'm teaching Chloe how to swim
and Scott won't leave her alone.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.040
I think he's jealous
that I'm touching his bird.

30:24.120 --> 30:27.640
Yeah, that's what you do.
Imagine you're bucking back.

30:27.720 --> 30:30.440
Aaron and Scott
are getting competitive over us.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.680
I only want to learn to swim.
I'm gonna have no arms left soon.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.120
Go on. Keep going.
I think I'm swimming.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.600
Go on, you're swimming!
I am!

30:38.680 --> 30:40.080
Come on, you can do this!

30:40.160 --> 30:43.800
Chloe is about as good at swimming
as she is at sucking dick.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.400
Pure shit!

30:45.480 --> 30:47.960
Grab it! Grab it! There you go.
Did I swim?

30:48.040 --> 30:50.600
Again, back.
Fuck, I can't touch the ground!

30:59.120 --> 31:02.040
Anna's sending us to work,
but now that we're in Greece,

31:02.120 --> 31:04.640
Tash-On Tours
has become Tashos Touros.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.840
Let's do it. Smash it.
Done.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.640
Have fun.
Don't get too pissed.

31:08.720 --> 31:12.400
I'm just hoping that work in Zante
is better than work in Newcastle,

31:12.480 --> 31:15.960
cos I've heard the Greeks have
shorter hours and shit. Buzzing.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.840
I'm gonna get absolutely mortal

31:17.920 --> 31:20.240
and treat it as
a pre pre-drinks night out.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.000
We'll smash it.
Exactly.

31:24.520 --> 31:25.760
(goat bleats)

31:26.760 --> 31:29.400
(cheering)

31:29.480 --> 31:33.720
Typical, the first night of work and
it's me and Charlotte. Thanks, Anna.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.120
Welcome to Tashos Touros!

31:37.200 --> 31:39.480
It's ice-breaker time.
Give us your name,

31:39.560 --> 31:42.440
the weirdest place you've had sex
and neck your shot.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.480
In a lift and I got interrupted
by the cleaner.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.680
The back of a police car.
Eh!

31:48.760 --> 31:50.960
Mate, I've had sex
in a lot of places,

31:51.040 --> 31:53.520
but how the fuck did you do that?

31:54.360 --> 31:57.480
The first game we're gonna play
is munch the watermelon.

31:57.560 --> 32:00.280
The boy who eats
the most melon wins.

32:00.360 --> 32:03.560
So supposedly,
I've got to demonstrate.(cheering)

32:03.640 --> 32:07.600
This is a bit awkward, Gaz eating
Charlotte's melon. What the fuck?

32:07.680 --> 32:08.960
Go.

32:09.040 --> 32:11.480
(laughter)

32:11.560 --> 32:14.400
Oh, God, I don't know
how I feel about this.

32:14.480 --> 32:17.840
Gary is full on licking us out here,
he's going for gold.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.840
I can't look down.
It looks really wicked.

32:20.920 --> 32:23.600
(shrieks)
Make eye contact, make eye contact.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.920
No, don't! I feel sick!
(laughter)

32:26.000 --> 32:28.440
I thought Gaz
was gonna be good at this game.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.360
I could've done better than that.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.440
Look. (laughs)

32:32.520 --> 32:34.800
Looks like I've been on me...
Period!

32:34.880 --> 32:37.640
I was nervous that
me and Charlotte might not get on,

32:37.720 --> 32:40.560
but maybe munching on a melon
from her crotch

32:40.640 --> 32:42.240
proves we're still friends.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.320
(blows whistle)

32:43.400 --> 32:45.160
(cheering, laughter)

32:45.240 --> 32:46.920
He is going in!

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
I normally hate work,
but this is awesome.

32:50.080 --> 32:53.240
Adam!
(cheering)

32:56.800 --> 32:58.720
That was a good first time at work.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.200
Normally I hate going to work,
but that...

33:03.160 --> 33:05.760
I was panicking about
working with Charlotte,

33:05.840 --> 33:08.160
but I will work with her
the whole summer.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.800
It's like we can finally
actually be friends.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.400
'It shows how far
me and Gary have come.'

33:20.480 --> 33:23.160
It's not awkward
cos we're both in relationships

33:23.240 --> 33:25.080
and we're finally in a good place.

33:29.760 --> 33:32.360
What? Now that there's
nothing like that...

33:32.440 --> 33:35.280
If you walked in and had a shit,
that would be awkward.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.720
Charlotte wants to do a shit
in front of me

33:37.800 --> 33:41.000
to prove how good a friends we are.
And that it normal how?

33:41.080 --> 33:44.880
You can shit in front of us, it'll
confirm we're friends, yeah? Yes.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.920
While the others are at work,
we're getting ready.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.120
Last night went tits up,
but tonight we're gonna smash it.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.800
How are you feeling
about you and Scott?

34:06.840 --> 34:09.480
If Scott pulled tonight,
I'd be a bit pissed off,

34:09.560 --> 34:11.920
but I'd never show
that it got under my skin.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.920
Shit, it's gonna be hard, isn't it?

34:14.000 --> 34:17.240
When I fancied Kyle and he was
talking to girls and stuff,

34:17.320 --> 34:18.600
I wanted to kill him.

34:18.680 --> 34:22.120
In the beginning with me and Kyle,
when we weren't very serious,

34:22.200 --> 34:24.960
it used to piss me off
when he talked to another girl.

34:25.040 --> 34:26.400
Right, I need to tell you,

34:26.480 --> 34:29.120
this dress is too short
and I'm too fat, so yous...

34:29.200 --> 34:31.720
You're not fat.
Yous need to be on nipple watch.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.080
My nipples
have got a mind of their own.

34:34.160 --> 34:36.720
The left one's all right
cos it's pure lush,

34:36.800 --> 34:38.920
but the right one
is fucking lifting.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.840
Right nipple's out,
tells us so I can get it back in,

34:41.920 --> 34:44.520
but the left's all right.
OK, that's fine then.

34:44.600 --> 34:48.200
I'm absolutely buzzing for tonight.
Let's get fucking mortal!

34:51.720 --> 34:53.080
Tonight's the night.

34:56.680 --> 35:00.360
I will not argue with her tonight.
I promise that. I swear down...

35:00.440 --> 35:02.440
If I was gonna put a bet
on that one,

35:02.520 --> 35:04.960
I probably wouldn't
cos you're full of shit.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.960
Here's the girls! Oi! Oi!
Here's the fucking fanny.

35:08.040 --> 35:11.240
No more messing about,
it's time to tear up fucking Zante.

35:11.320 --> 35:12.880
(all) Cheers!

35:12.960 --> 35:16.680
Zante, drop your panties
cos Scotty T's going vigilante.

35:27.080 --> 35:30.480
Whoo-hoo!Gaz, Charlotte
and Nathan rock up the club,

35:30.560 --> 35:33.120
and now we've got
the full crew back together.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.840
Let's get this party started!

35:44.880 --> 35:49.360
(Charlotte) This club is bouncing and
everyone's having an amazing time.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.680
I cannot wait to get on it.

35:54.800 --> 35:58.280
The music's on and we're looking
cool as fuck. Get me mortal!

36:02.640 --> 36:04.400
I necked on with Chloe last night,

36:04.480 --> 36:07.240
but I'm not gonna put
all me balls in one basket.

36:07.320 --> 36:10.360
Who better than to direct
my attention to than Marnie,

36:10.440 --> 36:14.120
cos she's looking proper fit
and I'd love to fucking ride her.

36:19.680 --> 36:23.240
(Gaz) 'Scott and Aaron
are still trying to graft Marnie.'

36:23.320 --> 36:26.920
It's like dangling a carrot
in front of two donkeys.

36:28.080 --> 36:32.520
After our kiss last night, I thought
Scott'd try necking with me tonight,

36:32.600 --> 36:36.000
but he's not showing us
any attention. Fucking bell-end!

36:47.640 --> 36:49.680
Me and Kyle
are having the best night.

36:49.760 --> 36:52.200
We're dancing,
and we're totally in love.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.960
It's how I want every night to be.

37:01.320 --> 37:04.520
When me and Holly are like this,
I absolutely love the girl.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.320
I hope we can carry on like this.

37:14.360 --> 37:17.760
I'm gonna dance with Aaron
and try and get Scott's attention.

37:18.880 --> 37:19.880
I'm such a player.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.120
Chloe is fucking loving life today.

37:25.200 --> 37:28.040
She's jumping around
like an absolute radgie.

37:33.280 --> 37:35.320
Scott's getting a bit pissed off,

37:35.400 --> 37:39.160
so it's nice to know I can get
back at him by flirting with Aaron.

37:39.240 --> 37:43.000
If she wants to dance, why doesn't
she just give us knock?

37:49.680 --> 37:52.840
If Aaron and Chloe got together,
I'd be pissed off at Aaron

37:52.920 --> 37:55.200
because you don't step
on your mate's toes.

37:59.360 --> 38:02.280
'Scott might say he doesn't care,
but I know he does.'

38:02.360 --> 38:04.960
Grow some balls and tell the truth.
You care.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.040
'Things are getting really messy.'

38:17.120 --> 38:20.160
I think I even just saw Nathan
be sick in an ice bucket.

38:22.760 --> 38:25.160
It's time to take the party
back to the villa.

38:27.480 --> 38:30.080
I don't know what the fuck
we've been drinking.

38:30.160 --> 38:33.560
We're like a bunch of wild animals
that's just escaped a zoo.

38:33.640 --> 38:36.520
Sucker... Nah.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.440
Ow!

38:43.320 --> 38:46.560
It's carnage.
We're more mortal than last night.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.120
You've got to be kidding me.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.240
(Scott) Oh, my god!

38:53.320 --> 38:56.440
I don't know what's got into
Charlotte, she's mortal.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.760
You could've just asked
to borrow a hose.

39:05.960 --> 39:08.440
I thought I'd seen Charlotte do

39:08.520 --> 39:11.360
everything you can possibly do
when you were drunk.

39:11.440 --> 39:14.760
She is now swimming with a plant
she's nicknamed Pete. Wow!

39:19.440 --> 39:22.880
I'm absolutely mortal, and both
Aaron and Scott can fuck off.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.120
I will go and pump me tits up. Whoo!

39:26.680 --> 39:29.200
I thought going for a swim
would be a good idea,

39:29.280 --> 39:30.920
but I'm fucking freezing now.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.200
At least I've got Aaron
to look after us.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.840
I've seen more of Marnie's body now

39:41.920 --> 39:45.840
than I did when I was trying to pull
her. How the fuck does that work?

39:51.080 --> 39:53.400
(laughter)

39:53.480 --> 39:56.680
'Aaron's covering us in
white stuff, but I'll let him off.'

39:56.760 --> 40:00.040
It's the only time he'll get to
do that to a girl this holiday.

40:00.120 --> 40:03.400
Mum!
Gaz, Gaz, come here!Gary!

40:03.480 --> 40:06.520
'Eh! Charlotte, why are you shouting
for me and your Mum?'

40:06.600 --> 40:07.800
What the fuck?!

40:09.160 --> 40:10.840
Oh!
Oh, you...

40:10.920 --> 40:13.280
It's so good
to be friends with Gary again,

40:13.360 --> 40:16.840
because who else would save us
from the mess and destruction

40:16.920 --> 40:19.040
I get meself into on nights out?

40:19.120 --> 40:20.320
(gasps)

40:21.360 --> 40:23.920
Me and Gary will always have
each other's back,

40:24.000 --> 40:25.840
even when we're old and wrinkly.

40:25.920 --> 40:29.600
I'll help him take his Viagra, and
he'll help me change me piss bag.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.200
(Holly laughs)

40:47.280 --> 40:50.280
Let's break the shag pad in gently
with a good 69.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.960
(moaning)

40:59.480 --> 41:02.800
That was wicked.
I'm happy I could be of assistance.

41:05.880 --> 41:09.240
I don't fucking care...

41:09.320 --> 41:12.800
...about anyone but me.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.640
OK, it's all right.

41:15.720 --> 41:17.040
I don't care...

41:17.120 --> 41:19.160
Oh, oh, shit!

41:19.240 --> 41:20.840
Oh, shit!

41:44.800 --> 41:45.000
.
