YEAH, I'M TRYING
TO BREAK YOUR HAND!

41:09.898 --> 41:12.971
HEY! SAM, WOULD YOU PLEASE
TELL HER TO QUIT IT?

41:12.971 --> 41:15.003
OW! WOULD YOU LET ME EXPLAIN?!

41:15.003 --> 41:17.576
FINE, FINE, EXPLAIN.
WHAT'S YOUR EXPLANATION?

41:17.576 --> 41:20.078
I'M ACTING ON ORDERS
FROM UPSTAIRS.

41:20.078 --> 41:25.213
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY
THEY HAD ME DO THE THINGS
THAT THEY HAD ME DO.

41:25.213 --> 41:26.254
GUYS!

41:26.254 --> 41:27.786
STOP! STOP!

41:27.786 --> 41:29.157
YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO BE UPSET,

41:29.157 --> 41:33.091
BUT THROWING ROCKS
IS NEVER CONSTRUCTIVE.

41:33.091 --> 41:35.664
ENOUGH!

41:36.925 --> 41:39.698
YEAH, I GOT MY WINGS
EARLIER TODAY.

41:39.698 --> 41:41.169
I WANTED IT TO BE A SURPRISE.

41:41.169 --> 41:45.003
YOU GOT YOUR WINGS
BECAUSE YOU BROKE
MY HAND?

41:45.003 --> 41:46.735
THAT'S GREAT.
CONGRATULATIONS.

41:46.735 --> 41:49.237
IT'S BECAUSE OF
HOW I HELPED YOU.

41:49.237 --> 41:50.008
HELPED?

41:50.008 --> 41:52.510
THE DEVIL OWNS
BOTH OF OUR SOULS!

41:52.510 --> 41:55.243
HEAVEN WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS, ANDI.

41:55.243 --> 41:57.916
YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE.

41:57.916 --> 41:59.087
BELIEVE WHAT?

41:59.087 --> 42:01.750
THAT YOU ARE NOT ALONE.
