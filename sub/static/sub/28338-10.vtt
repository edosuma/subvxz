00:01.815 --> 00:03.105
[Star]
Ah!

00:04.645 --> 00:06.525
They're going to be here
any second, people.

00:07.605 --> 00:08.695
Delicious.

00:08.695 --> 00:10.485
Beautiful.

00:11.855 --> 00:14.525
Oh, yeah, you cover up
those dark secrets.

00:14.525 --> 00:16.695
Okay, now all we need is...

00:16.695 --> 00:18.355
Eclipsa!

00:18.355 --> 00:20.645
Eclipsa?

00:20.645 --> 00:22.695
-[crying]
-[Marco] Here you go.

00:22.695 --> 00:24.735
Good baby.

00:24.735 --> 00:25.855
[screams]

00:25.855 --> 00:27.355
Eclipsa?

00:27.355 --> 00:28.945
Star, help me!

00:28.945 --> 00:30.645
I'm busy!

00:30.645 --> 00:32.105
Archibald, have you
seen Eclipsa?

00:32.105 --> 00:34.735
Not since yesterday,
Miss Butterfly.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.145
Ugh! This is the first
royal visit

00:36.145 --> 00:37.525
since Eclipsa
became queen.

00:37.525 --> 00:39.605
We cannot afford
to mess this up.

00:39.605 --> 00:41.355
-[clock chimes]
-[gasps]

00:41.355 --> 00:43.235
Oh, no! They're here.

00:44.565 --> 00:45.695
[sighs]

00:47.735 --> 00:49.235
[door hinges creak]

00:49.235 --> 00:51.905
Hello, King, Queen and Princess
Spiderbite.

00:51.905 --> 00:53.445
Welcome to monster temp--

00:53.445 --> 00:56.105
I mean,
new butterfly castle.

00:56.105 --> 00:57.775
Where's Queen Eclipsa?

00:57.775 --> 00:59.815
Shouldn't she be the one
to greet us?

00:59.815 --> 01:01.355
[laughs]

01:01.355 --> 01:04.775
Oh, my sincerest apologies
on behalf of the queen.

01:04.775 --> 01:06.565
She'll be here
as soon as she can.

01:06.565 --> 01:08.565
Well, I can't say
that I'm surprised

01:08.565 --> 01:10.775
that she's ignoring
royal traditions.

01:10.775 --> 01:12.525
King Spiderbite!

01:12.525 --> 01:14.235
You've trimmed your beard,
didn't you?

01:14.235 --> 01:15.695
It looks great.

01:15.695 --> 01:18.315
Thanks.
It's full of spiders.

01:18.315 --> 01:19.945
And Queen Spiderbite,

01:19.945 --> 01:21.945
oh, beautiful gown.

01:21.945 --> 01:26.195
It really brings out
your glowing complexion.

01:27.235 --> 01:28.565
Hey, Penelope.

01:28.565 --> 01:30.735
Cool phone.
Where'd you get it?

01:31.775 --> 01:33.605
Sorry, did you
say something?

01:35.445 --> 01:37.775
Oh, look at that.
The refreshments are here.

01:37.775 --> 01:40.315
Your beverages, My Lords.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.815
Please enjoy.

01:42.815 --> 01:44.905
Hey, Archibald,
can I talk to you for a second?

01:44.905 --> 01:46.645
So, did you find her?

01:46.645 --> 01:47.855
Not as yet.

01:47.855 --> 01:49.775
I've been searching
all over the castle.

01:49.775 --> 01:50.775
[groans]

01:50.775 --> 01:52.235
Search harder!

01:52.235 --> 01:54.145
-Well, I never...
-The audacity.

01:54.145 --> 01:55.735
Your Majesties!

01:55.735 --> 02:00.775
I regret to inform you that
the queen is still preoccupied,

02:00.775 --> 02:01.775
but she hopes
you will all enjoy

02:01.775 --> 02:05.775
the awe-inspiring beauty
that awaits.

02:05.775 --> 02:09.195
This is one of Eclipsa's
favorite parts of the castle,

02:09.195 --> 02:11.605
the gallery of
monster art.

02:11.605 --> 02:12.775
Queen Spiderbite,
someone told me

02:12.775 --> 02:14.815
you were a fan
of art history.

02:14.815 --> 02:17.315
Well, you are going to love...

02:17.315 --> 02:18.905
this thing.

02:18.905 --> 02:20.815
No?

02:20.815 --> 02:21.855
[laughs nervously]

02:21.855 --> 02:23.235
Okay. Oh!

02:23.235 --> 02:26.815
Well, maybe you're more
into abstract things.

02:26.815 --> 02:28.775
[whispers]

02:30.025 --> 02:32.565
Not a fan. Okay.

02:32.565 --> 02:36.235
Hey, Penelope,
how are you liking the tour?

02:36.235 --> 02:37.735
Totally.

02:37.735 --> 02:40.235
-[growls]
-[Queen clears throat]

02:40.235 --> 02:43.105
Will Eclipsa
ever be joining us?

02:43.105 --> 02:45.645
Who wants to see
a little entertainment?

02:45.645 --> 02:50.485
We've prepared something that
will for sure blow you away.

02:50.485 --> 02:53.485
This is a traditional
monster dance,

02:53.485 --> 02:56.485
beautifully performed
by our very own

02:56.485 --> 02:57.735
monster dance troupe.

02:58.945 --> 03:01.025
[Middle East music plays]

03:20.855 --> 03:22.145
[gasps]

03:29.065 --> 03:30.855
Whoo-hoo!

03:30.855 --> 03:32.815
Oh, amazing! Beautiful!

03:32.815 --> 03:34.645
Encore! Encore!

03:34.645 --> 03:37.145
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

03:37.145 --> 03:39.405
Whoo. Whoo.

03:39.405 --> 03:41.105
[sighs]

03:41.105 --> 03:43.565
Okay, you know,
they actually worked really hard

03:43.565 --> 03:44.775
on that routine.

03:44.775 --> 03:48.145
Yes, it looks like they spent
weeks practicing.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.775
But that doesn't mean
that I have to like it.

03:50.775 --> 03:51.985
Okay, you guys
have had issues

03:51.985 --> 03:53.985
with everything
you've seen today.

03:53.985 --> 03:56.775
And you won't stop texting.

03:56.775 --> 03:58.145
Huh?

03:58.145 --> 03:59.735
I know what this is about.

03:59.735 --> 04:02.405
You guys have a problem
with monsters.

04:02.405 --> 04:03.815
And no matter what they do,

04:03.815 --> 04:06.355
it's never going
to be enough for you.

04:06.355 --> 04:08.945
Monsters are not
the problem here.

04:08.945 --> 04:11.905
Maybe you need to adjust
your nasty attitudes.

04:11.905 --> 04:13.195
[Slime clears throat]

04:14.645 --> 04:15.905
Is this a bad time?

04:15.905 --> 04:17.945
Hey, you made it.

04:20.145 --> 04:21.945
Uh, what?

04:21.945 --> 04:23.815
Sorry, Star, I was texting
my boyfriend this whole time

04:23.815 --> 04:25.815
so that he could
meet up with us.

04:25.815 --> 04:28.775
It took forever, because I kept
losing my phone.

04:28.775 --> 04:30.945
Slime is your boyfriend?

04:30.945 --> 04:32.985
Slime, good to see you again.

04:32.985 --> 04:35.145
How are you, dear?

04:35.145 --> 04:36.945
Give me some
of that slime, Slime.

04:36.945 --> 04:38.855
Sure thing, King S.

04:38.855 --> 04:41.775
But you guys
hate monsters.

04:41.775 --> 04:44.235
We have no problem
with monsters.

04:44.235 --> 04:46.355
Our problem
is with Globgore.

04:46.355 --> 04:48.775
Crusher of skulls.
Plucker of limbs.

04:48.775 --> 04:50.235
How can you live
in this castle

04:50.235 --> 04:52.645
and ignore
his atrocities?

04:52.645 --> 04:55.235
What? No, no, no, no.
Those are just rumors.

04:55.235 --> 04:56.815
So why is all the tableware

04:56.815 --> 04:59.105
covered in Globgorian
horror parties?

04:59.105 --> 05:01.985
No, this is just cute monster
decoration--

05:01.985 --> 05:03.525
oh.

05:03.525 --> 05:05.815
Then there's this artwork
you showed us.

05:05.815 --> 05:08.405
Did you even
read the label?

05:08.405 --> 05:10.105
Oh, that's what those
are for.

05:10.105 --> 05:12.645
And "The Cold Unfeeling Stare
of Globgore",

05:12.645 --> 05:15.235
subtitled,
"He Will Eat You".

05:15.235 --> 05:17.855
Or, "Globgore's Army

05:17.855 --> 05:20.985
Burns Spiderbite Village
to the Ground".

05:20.985 --> 05:23.275
Boy, that got real specific.

05:23.275 --> 05:24.985
And that dance
you showed us

05:24.985 --> 05:26.905
is a tribute to Globgore

05:26.905 --> 05:29.855
eating my great-great-granduncle
Shastacan.

05:29.855 --> 05:31.565
Think you left out
a few "greats".

05:31.565 --> 05:34.855
No, No, Globgore's
a vegetarian.

05:34.855 --> 05:35.945
We only agreed
to come today

05:35.945 --> 05:38.235
because Penelope insisted
we give you a chance.

05:38.235 --> 05:40.565
But clearly nothing
has changed.

05:40.565 --> 05:42.405
But Eclipsa said...

05:42.405 --> 05:45.695
That evil witch doesn't care
about anyone but herself.

05:45.695 --> 05:48.025
We all heard what happened
between her and Rhombulus.

05:48.025 --> 05:49.735
-But that--
-[Queen] How do you know

05:49.735 --> 05:51.355
she won't try
a stunt like that again?

05:51.355 --> 05:52.905
-I...
-[King] How can you trust her?

05:52.905 --> 05:54.735
I'm sure there is
a perfectly good explanation

05:54.735 --> 05:55.945
for all this.

05:55.945 --> 05:58.905
And I will go find that out
right now.

06:00.065 --> 06:01.485
[groaning]

06:01.485 --> 06:03.275
Eclipsa, where are you?

06:03.275 --> 06:04.905
I need you!

06:04.905 --> 06:07.065
Oh, duh, I summoned
the all-seeing eye

06:07.065 --> 06:07.855
to tear a hole into the sky.

06:07.855 --> 06:09.355
Reveal to me
that which is hidden,

06:09.355 --> 06:10.815
unveil to me
what is forbidden.

06:12.275 --> 06:13.735
Gotcha!

06:16.145 --> 06:17.945
Glossaryck,
what about this one?

06:17.945 --> 06:18.945
-No.
-Okay.

06:18.945 --> 06:21.565
-Well, this one, perhaps?
-Nah.

06:21.565 --> 06:23.105
You're not even looking.

06:23.105 --> 06:24.445
-Eclipsa!
-Star?

06:24.445 --> 06:25.945
What do you think
you're doing up here?

06:25.945 --> 06:27.985
-Well, I was just--
-I'm sorry, did you just say,

06:27.985 --> 06:29.945
"I'm avoiding an important
meeting with the Spiderbites"?

06:29.945 --> 06:32.445
Oh, no! That was today?

06:32.445 --> 06:34.905
Eclipsa, these alliances
are important.

06:34.905 --> 06:37.525
All the other kingdoms
are terrified of you.

06:37.525 --> 06:39.105
The Spiderbites are
the only ones

06:39.105 --> 06:40.405
who would even visit us,

06:40.405 --> 06:42.775
and you just completely
ditched them.

06:42.775 --> 06:44.775
If you don't come
talk to them right now,

06:44.775 --> 06:45.985
you'll never convince anyone

06:45.985 --> 06:47.855
you're not
the Queen of Darkness.

06:47.855 --> 06:50.355
I'm so, so sorry.
I lost track of time.

06:50.355 --> 06:51.645
Your Majesty,

06:51.645 --> 06:54.105
the Spiderbites,
they're leaving.

06:54.105 --> 06:55.485
-What?
-What?

06:55.485 --> 06:57.735
[Eclipsa]
Wait!

06:57.735 --> 07:00.105
Please, just wait
one moment.

07:00.105 --> 07:04.405
Your Majesties, allow me to
express my sincerest apologies.

07:04.405 --> 07:07.145
I never should have
kept you waiting like that.

07:07.145 --> 07:08.405
Well, we're not surprised.

07:08.405 --> 07:10.105
This castle makes it
quite clear

07:10.105 --> 07:12.645
that you only care
for your Globgore.

07:12.645 --> 07:15.775
I... I understand
what this must look like.

07:15.775 --> 07:18.025
The paintings, the mural.

07:18.025 --> 07:18.985
The Dance of Death.

07:18.985 --> 07:20.985
The Dance of Death?

07:20.985 --> 07:23.025
You performed
the Dance of Death?

07:23.025 --> 07:25.605
I didn't know there was
a dance of death.

07:25.605 --> 07:28.815
I also didn't know
that Globgore ate Shastacan.

07:28.815 --> 07:33.145
The truth is a little more
complex than that, but...

07:33.145 --> 07:35.735
yes, he did.

07:35.735 --> 07:36.985
I'm truly sorry
for how terribly

07:36.985 --> 07:39.065
I've treated you,
Your Majesties.

07:39.065 --> 07:41.695
And after what happened
between me and Rhombulus,

07:41.695 --> 07:44.195
it must be especially hard
for you to trust me.

07:44.195 --> 07:47.315
But I hope you will allow me
to make it up to you.

07:47.315 --> 07:51.235
In fact, I'd like to show you
something.

07:53.065 --> 07:54.485
[both gasp]

07:54.485 --> 07:56.985
I know that seeing this
must be terrifying,

07:56.985 --> 07:59.195
but let me assure you

07:59.195 --> 08:02.195
Globgore is very much stuck
in this crystal.

08:02.195 --> 08:04.405
[grunts]

08:04.405 --> 08:08.445
For the good of the kingdom,
that is where she shall remain.

08:08.445 --> 08:10.145
Oh, my.

08:10.145 --> 08:15.065
You know, I've never actually
seen Rhombulus's magic before.

08:15.065 --> 08:17.355
It's really
quite impressive.

08:17.355 --> 08:20.645
He really is stuck in there,
isn't he?

08:20.645 --> 08:23.145
Oh, yes. There's no way
he's getting out of this thing.

08:23.145 --> 08:25.695
Thank you for showing us this,
Eclipsa.

08:25.695 --> 08:28.235
I feel a little more
at ease now.

08:28.235 --> 08:30.235
Yes, he's basically dead.

08:30.235 --> 08:31.735
[both laugh]

08:31.735 --> 08:35.105
Well, I'm glad I could put
your fears to rest.

08:36.145 --> 08:38.485
It was lovely meeting you,
Eclipsa.

08:38.485 --> 08:41.235
And if you ever need allies,
you have our support.

08:41.235 --> 08:44.145
The other kingdoms might not
be so easy to convince,

08:44.145 --> 08:46.025
especially the Johanssons.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.445
They'll be a nightmare.

08:47.445 --> 08:48.985
But we wish you good luck.

08:48.985 --> 08:50.645
Until next time.

08:50.645 --> 08:54.405
-Goodbye. Thank you for coming.
-Bye, now. See you next time.

08:54.405 --> 08:57.065
[Star]
Well, we narrowly avoided
a total disaster.

08:57.065 --> 09:00.235
That was a pretty nice save
you pulled back there.

09:00.235 --> 09:02.065
Well, I wouldn't have had
to pull anything

09:02.065 --> 09:04.195
if I'd been doing my job
in the first place.

09:04.195 --> 09:07.065
Yeah. What were you doing
back there?

09:07.065 --> 09:09.275
I was looking
for The Book of Spells.

09:09.275 --> 09:11.145
The Book of Spells?

09:11.145 --> 09:15.405
Are you still looking
for a way to free Globgore?

09:15.405 --> 09:16.815
No, my dear.

09:16.815 --> 09:18.485
There's nothing I can do
for him now.

09:18.485 --> 09:20.855
It's... it's just that I...

09:20.855 --> 09:22.275
[sighs]

09:22.275 --> 09:24.195
I'm not good enough
at magic.

09:24.195 --> 09:27.235
You've done some of the most
powerful magic I've ever seen.

09:27.235 --> 09:28.815
Thank you.

09:28.815 --> 09:31.065
But I only know how to do magic
that can help myself.

09:31.065 --> 09:34.065
I need to learn magic
that will help my kingdom.

09:34.065 --> 09:36.195
I wish I could be
more like you,

09:36.195 --> 09:38.065
conjuring new spells
that are all your own,

09:38.065 --> 09:40.275
even without a wand.

09:40.275 --> 09:42.525
I need the book
to guide me.

09:42.525 --> 09:44.275
Well, I hate
to break it to you,

09:44.275 --> 09:46.275
but that book is super gone.

09:46.275 --> 09:48.315
Ludo burned it up
ages ago.

09:48.315 --> 09:49.735
But if any of it survived,

09:49.735 --> 09:52.145
I might be able
to bring it back.

09:52.145 --> 09:54.945
Glossaryck has these wonderful
little silk bugs

09:54.945 --> 09:58.945
that can reconstruct anything
from even the tiniest scrap.

09:58.945 --> 10:00.105
Don't you, Glossaryck?

10:00.105 --> 10:02.275
They're almost finished
repairing my culottes

10:02.275 --> 10:05.145
and they make a mean
pair of underwear.

10:05.145 --> 10:07.145
Yes, they're very crafty.

10:07.145 --> 10:10.275
Are you sure there's no trace
of the book left?

10:10.275 --> 10:12.195
Anything you happened to find

10:12.195 --> 10:13.735
while wandering around
the castle?

10:14.695 --> 10:16.025
No.

10:16.025 --> 10:18.235
No, not that I can think of.

10:18.235 --> 10:20.235
[Eclipsa]
Well, that's a pity.

10:20.235 --> 10:23.195
Well, thank you for all
your help today, Star.
