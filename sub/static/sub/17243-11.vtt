WEBVTT

00:06.957 --> 00:09.916
Agghhhhhh! (Bleep) me! (Bleep) me!

00:09.950 --> 00:11.582
- What?
- (Bleep) me!

00:11.617 --> 00:13.651
- What?
- John, there's something in the bed!

00:13.686 --> 00:15.086
- What?
- Something crawled up my leg and I can't see it!

00:15.121 --> 00:16.822
- What?
- I can't see it!

00:16.856 --> 00:18.790
- A spider?
- No! Something invisible like...

00:18.825 --> 00:22.393
Lice, or scabies, or... bed bugs!

00:22.428 --> 00:23.561
Oh, we don't have bed bugs.

00:23.595 --> 00:26.131
Oh, John, I can't afford
to burn all my clothes!

00:26.165 --> 00:28.050
Oh, Moira, relax.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.635
Just relax. If we had lice, I'd have lice!

00:30.660 --> 00:32.643
Guess who?

00:32.668 --> 00:35.393
Deedee?!

00:35.418 --> 00:39.033
- Hi, Momo.
- What the hell?

00:39.057 --> 00:41.525
Sorry. I know I should've
called, but um... I just thought

00:41.560 --> 00:44.961
it'd be really fun to
come see my older sister

00:44.996 --> 00:49.300
in her... new digs. You
know, a little visit.

00:49.334 --> 00:51.767
Oh. Um... do you really have lice?

00:51.802 --> 00:54.073
I'd hate to contract... lice.

00:54.098 --> 01:03.322
- Synced the_foe for Misia

01:03.407 --> 01:09.288
So, Deedee, you are... looking well.

01:09.313 --> 01:12.315
Seaweed facials. I get one every week.

01:12.349 --> 01:14.650
But enough about me, I
wanna talk about you guys.

01:14.684 --> 01:17.419
Mm. I want you to know that I...

01:17.453 --> 01:20.156
Really wanted to come and visit you

01:20.190 --> 01:21.690
when I heard about your life collapsing,

01:21.724 --> 01:23.926
but I got this really big
job promotion that week

01:23.960 --> 01:25.761
and things got, you know, kinda crazy.

01:25.796 --> 01:27.963
Plus, we haven't really seen
much of each other recently.

01:28.398 --> 01:30.832
Yes, well, we've had kind of a hectic year.

01:30.866 --> 01:32.767
Well, thank goodness for the Internet!

01:32.802 --> 01:34.236
Seemed to be the only thing letting me know

01:34.270 --> 01:35.937
you two were still alive.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.739
Telephone is also amazing!

01:37.773 --> 01:39.407
You just push the buttons and say,

01:39.441 --> 01:42.543
"Hi, it's me, your deadbeat sister."

01:42.578 --> 01:45.313
Well, it's a treat seeing
you two going at it again.

01:45.347 --> 01:46.881
Kids!

01:46.916 --> 01:48.983
Come in and say hi to your aunt Deedee!

01:49.018 --> 01:51.953
Better hurry before she
disappears for another decade.

01:51.987 --> 01:55.022
Oh! What?

01:55.056 --> 01:58.258
Look at you guys! You've grown!

01:58.292 --> 02:00.160
Why did I think that you were dead?

02:00.195 --> 02:02.395
Ah, you're so sweet.

02:02.430 --> 02:04.865
Now how long has it been
since we've seen each other?

02:04.899 --> 02:06.466
I think you crashed one of my pool parties

02:06.500 --> 02:09.568
with some guy you were
calling "Uncle Julio."

02:09.594 --> 02:11.694
Oh!  I remember that.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.274
All right, you guys treat yourself, okay?

02:15.308 --> 02:17.343
Buy yourself something nice.

02:17.377 --> 02:18.745
- A hundred dollars?! Oh my goodness, wow.
- Oh my God! Oh my God,

02:18.779 --> 02:21.714
I missed you! I missed you so much!

02:21.749 --> 02:23.850
I missed you so much!

02:23.884 --> 02:27.419
Oh gosh, look at that. They are sweet kids!

02:27.454 --> 02:29.359
I don't know what you were
so worried about, Moira.

02:29.384 --> 02:31.385
Deedee, what are you doing here?

02:31.420 --> 02:33.021
Are you staying here at the motel?

02:33.055 --> 02:34.888
Can I... get you a room?

02:34.923 --> 02:37.557
No. God no.

02:37.592 --> 02:40.694
No, I mean... no, I... I booked
myself into a junior suite

02:40.729 --> 02:42.529
at the Comfort Inn in Elmdale, thank you.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.643
This is very darling, it's
just it doesn't have a gym

02:44.666 --> 02:46.066
and I'm kind of in the best
shape of my life right now

02:46.101 --> 02:47.417
and I kinda wanna keep it that way.

02:47.442 --> 02:49.003
Okay.

02:52.722 --> 02:56.743
Okay, so you're saying that I
would be as in shape as you are

02:56.777 --> 02:58.044
if I just fixed lights all day?

02:58.078 --> 02:59.646
Pretty much.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.874
Well... a few pull ups here and there.

03:01.899 --> 03:07.454
Okay, so you do workout.
You are such a liar!

03:07.488 --> 03:11.525
Oh! Wow! Did Stevie say
something funny or... ?

03:11.559 --> 03:13.026
- Grant, this is David Rose.
- Hi.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.493
He's one of our permanent guests here.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.944
Don't say that... again.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.545
Grant does repairs around here.

03:17.561 --> 03:19.828
- Oh, great.
- He was also just trying to tell me

03:19.862 --> 03:23.199
that he got that body
from just being a handyman.

03:23.233 --> 03:25.926
Well, isn't Grant just a big fat liar!

03:27.904 --> 03:30.706
- Um...
- I gotta grab the right marette, so...

03:30.740 --> 03:33.041
My head is all over the place.
She keeps distracting me.

03:36.646 --> 03:40.487
Wow. He is wearing a tight shirt!

03:41.960 --> 03:45.096
So is he gonna do some repairs
on your... on your undies?

03:45.121 --> 03:46.995
Who's to say he hasn't already.

03:47.020 --> 03:49.801
Wow! Great.

03:49.826 --> 03:51.591
Why, is that a problem for you?

03:51.625 --> 03:53.859
No. No. Do you.

03:53.893 --> 03:56.895
Do him. Do both. Do things.

03:56.929 --> 03:58.530
- Great. I think I might.
- Yeah.

03:58.565 --> 04:01.467
Good. Jump in.

04:03.670 --> 04:05.504
So...

04:07.589 --> 04:10.308
We should probably
establish some boundaries

04:10.343 --> 04:12.544
about this whole friends
with benefits thing.

04:12.579 --> 04:14.579
Okay. Yeah. No, let's do that.

04:14.604 --> 04:16.914
Let's, uh, let's put up some boundaries

04:16.947 --> 04:19.416
uh, for the infrequent benefits
that our friendship has.

04:19.451 --> 04:21.151
I think that's really good.

04:21.185 --> 04:23.588
Can we do that after
you screw mister fix-it

04:23.622 --> 04:26.501
or... would you like to do it now?

04:26.526 --> 04:27.992
Let's throw some boundaries up.

04:28.026 --> 04:29.861
'Kay.

04:31.663 --> 04:32.830
Hey, Twyla.

04:34.966 --> 04:37.066
Twyla!

04:37.101 --> 04:38.702
Twyla?!

04:43.045 --> 04:45.813
I'm so sorry. I really didn't
think that was gonna hit you.

04:45.848 --> 04:47.582
That's okay. Your mom did the
same thing to me this morning.

04:47.616 --> 04:49.932
- Okay.
- What can I get you guys?

04:49.957 --> 04:52.926
Just coffees. Thanks.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.417
So what's going on over there?

04:54.426 --> 04:57.495
I'm just working on something.
Just a little thing for Mutt.

04:57.529 --> 05:00.131
Oh! Is it his birthday or something?

05:00.166 --> 05:02.000
No. Um, my dad always said,

05:02.034 --> 05:03.735
"When in doubt, say it with a song."

05:03.769 --> 05:05.536
He was a roadie with Fleetwood Mac

05:05.571 --> 05:08.039
and that was the last thing
Mick Fleetwood said to him...

05:08.074 --> 05:12.010
Before the band hit him
with a restraining order.

05:12.044 --> 05:14.797
So you're writing a song for Mutt then?

05:14.822 --> 05:16.489
Yeah, I'm trying to.

05:16.523 --> 05:18.649
Cute! So what, is it about...

05:18.674 --> 05:22.220
Your feelings, or is it love and... what?

05:22.245 --> 05:24.130
Are we shooting a Dateline
investigative report?

05:24.164 --> 05:26.165
No... we're not.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.740
I'm just looking out for my friend.

05:27.765 --> 05:33.607
Um... honestly, Twy, ixnay on the ongsay.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.075
Because I tried it once

05:36.109 --> 05:38.990
and the guy ripped the
guitar out of my hands

05:39.015 --> 05:42.380
and he just started
smashing it on the ground.

05:42.405 --> 05:45.596
Granted, I'm tone deaf and he was a...

05:45.621 --> 05:48.510
He was a super angry marine, but...

05:48.535 --> 05:50.889
Just let the girl write
her boyfriend a song!

05:50.924 --> 05:53.190
Okay, I know! And I'm all
for it, I'm all for it.

05:53.225 --> 05:54.689
I just think it's um...

05:54.714 --> 05:57.561
I think it's a super big mistake.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.074

06:10.382 --> 06:12.316
David!

06:12.351 --> 06:14.818
Jocelyn. Hi.

06:14.853 --> 06:17.254
Can I ask you something?

06:17.289 --> 06:19.056
Uh... that depends.

06:19.091 --> 06:20.891
How shall I put this?

06:20.925 --> 06:22.460
You strike me as the sort of person

06:22.494 --> 06:25.096
that had a hard time in high school.

06:25.130 --> 06:26.697
Thank you.

06:26.731 --> 06:29.905
Your floral top, for instance.

06:30.452 --> 06:31.975
Is there something I can help you with?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.104
Well, there's a new kid in my school

06:34.138 --> 06:35.705
and he's having a little
trouble fitting in.

06:35.739 --> 06:37.874
Mm-hmm.

06:37.908 --> 06:40.377
He's also struggling with his sexuality,

06:40.411 --> 06:42.312
which I think that you may be also...

06:42.346 --> 06:43.813
What can I help you with, Jocelyn?

06:43.847 --> 06:46.182
Well, I was thinking,
wouldn't it be wonderful

06:46.217 --> 06:48.217
if you could come down to the school,

06:48.250 --> 06:49.617
you know, maybe talk to him

06:49.651 --> 06:51.919
and tell him that...
things only get better.

06:55.051 --> 06:59.421
The idea of me life
coaching another human being

06:59.456 --> 07:03.792
should scare you. A lot. I don't...

07:03.826 --> 07:07.462
I knew there was a good person
in there somewhere, David.

07:07.496 --> 07:10.365
Oh, and honey, get the quilted;

07:10.399 --> 07:12.433
that other stuff will chafe you right up.

07:15.004 --> 07:16.871
So this is weird.

07:16.905 --> 07:19.207
Um, today marks the longest relationship

07:19.241 --> 07:21.309
that I've ever voluntarily
had with someone.

07:21.343 --> 07:22.786
Voluntarily.

07:22.811 --> 07:25.693
Yeah. The actual longest
relationship was um...

07:25.709 --> 07:27.527
A three month affair with a Saudi prince,

07:27.552 --> 07:29.187
but for the last two months of that

07:29.221 --> 07:31.622
I was trapped in his palace
trying to get to an embassy.

07:31.656 --> 07:34.525
Um, so... hey. How is it
going with you and Twyla?

07:34.559 --> 07:36.460
You guys are looking cute.

07:36.485 --> 07:40.250
Uh... I don't know.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.399
Why? What's going on?

07:47.382 --> 07:49.773
I dunno. It... it's nothing. It's fine.

07:49.807 --> 07:52.743
Okay, if my boyfriend ever described

07:52.777 --> 07:55.278
our relationship as "fine,"
I think I would literally...

07:55.312 --> 07:58.295
it's just... it feels
like it's run its course.

07:58.320 --> 08:03.209
- What?
- And I think we've both known it for a while now.

08:04.187 --> 08:06.756
Oh.

08:13.639 --> 08:16.998
Oh, give me a break. How did you find me?

08:17.032 --> 08:20.235
Well, where else is there to go?

08:20.269 --> 08:21.803
And Johnny may have told me.

08:21.838 --> 08:23.771
Thank you, Johnny.

08:23.805 --> 08:26.240
Moira, why are you making
this so difficult for me?

08:26.274 --> 08:28.442
Oh... where do I start?

08:28.477 --> 08:30.577
Um, you know, I think it's
best we don't go there.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.611
No, I'd like to go there. Please, take me.

08:33.635 --> 08:37.017
Fifty thousand dollars.
Does that sound familiar?

08:37.042 --> 08:39.640
- Yes. You gave that to me as a downpayment
- No! Loaned it.

08:39.674 --> 08:41.586
You gave it to me as a down payment

08:41.611 --> 08:43.144
for my buffalonian town house.

08:43.178 --> 08:45.908
We handed you the money and you said... ?

08:49.418 --> 08:51.351
- Thank you?
- Oh, too late.

08:51.386 --> 08:55.066
Well, Moira, considering you had

08:55.113 --> 08:57.357
over 500 million dollars in the bank,

08:57.392 --> 08:59.791
I'm a little personally
offended that I didn't get more.

08:59.816 --> 09:01.094
Go away, Deedee.

09:01.129 --> 09:05.765
No. No. Not until I do
what I came here to do.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.901
Didn't want to hurt your
feelings, but I forgot.

09:07.936 --> 09:09.502
- Don't you dare.
- You don't have feelings.

09:09.537 --> 09:12.605
- Don't you dare.
- Yes, yes. I am paying you back.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.386
It's not everything, but it's a start.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.653
So walk me through this...

09:22.668 --> 09:25.536
She offered you a cheque
and you turned it down?

09:25.571 --> 09:27.438
She was insulting us!

09:27.473 --> 09:30.341
Moira, the woman dates
dive bar owners, okay?

09:30.376 --> 09:32.577
Let her insult us!

09:32.611 --> 09:33.944
Well, I don't know whether you've noticed,

09:33.979 --> 09:36.113
but we could use the money.

09:36.148 --> 09:37.948
You talk about bed bugs?

09:37.983 --> 09:39.784
That check could pay for fumigation.

09:39.818 --> 09:41.919
Better yet, we could move to a place

09:41.953 --> 09:43.421
that doesn't have bed bugs.

09:43.455 --> 09:45.990
I don't want her money. I want our money.

09:46.024 --> 09:48.726
She owes us! We loaned her $50,000 dollars!

09:48.761 --> 09:51.162
We gave her $50,000 dollars,

09:51.196 --> 09:53.869
and you spent more than
that on wigs that year.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.600
I don't see any one else
lining up to give us cheques.

09:56.634 --> 10:00.069
Why are you taking her side?

10:00.104 --> 10:02.372
I'm not taking her side, but
she's offering us a way out

10:02.407 --> 10:04.541
and you're letting your
pride get in the way.

10:04.575 --> 10:06.343
It's all I have left, John, literally.

10:06.377 --> 10:07.778
Swallow it, Moira.

10:07.812 --> 10:10.614
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

10:10.648 --> 10:13.249
And then we can buy a case of champagne

10:13.284 --> 10:15.418
to wash it down with.

10:18.254 --> 10:20.189
So... you and Grant.

10:20.223 --> 10:22.591
How are things going?

10:22.626 --> 10:25.561
Uh... well, he asked me
out for dinner tonight,

10:25.595 --> 10:27.830
so... we're gonna do that.

10:27.864 --> 10:29.064
We're gonna go for dinner, Grant and I.

10:29.098 --> 10:32.234
Yeah! Yeah, that's...

10:32.268 --> 10:34.670
Well, he seems like a
really like respectable guy.

10:34.705 --> 10:37.071
Like one of those guys that has like a...

10:37.105 --> 10:40.007
Candy bowl of condoms on his
bedside table or something.

10:40.042 --> 10:41.776
Oh, hope so. Wonder what colour I'll get.

10:41.811 --> 10:42.977
Yeah!

10:43.011 --> 10:46.881
So I am mentoring a
teen in crisis... later.

10:46.915 --> 10:48.249
That's what I'm doing.

10:48.283 --> 10:50.485
One of Jocelyn's students, so...

10:50.519 --> 10:52.286
He's being bullied because he's different,

10:52.321 --> 10:54.422
so I'm helping to change his life.

10:54.457 --> 10:56.056
Giving back, so...

10:56.090 --> 10:58.592
- Wow...
- Yeah.

10:58.626 --> 11:01.027
And on a scale of one to ten,

11:01.062 --> 11:04.698
how much are you looking forward to that?

11:04.733 --> 11:07.368
Three point five. I'm gonna leave you be

11:07.402 --> 11:09.069
because it's not everyday
you get to go on a date

11:09.103 --> 11:11.338
with a guy who owns a windowless van, so...

11:11.373 --> 11:13.006
Oh, Grant.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.875
Hi!

11:16.943 --> 11:18.838
What're you doing? You
checking out porn again?

11:18.863 --> 11:20.346
I'm gonna go.

11:20.381 --> 11:22.348
I'm gonna go. Um...

11:22.383 --> 11:23.949
Warmest regards to you both.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.520
Best wishes.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.758
Such a weird dude.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.459
Yes. Yes, he is.

11:59.033 --> 12:00.653
You must be Connor.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.733
Yeah.

12:03.741 --> 12:05.786
I don't know how much
Mrs. Schitt has told you,

12:05.811 --> 12:08.911
but she asked me to
come in and have a chat.

12:08.945 --> 12:13.015
She thinks that since
we're both... new here

12:13.049 --> 12:14.517
it might be worth talking about some things

12:14.551 --> 12:17.600
like, you know, fitting in.

12:21.929 --> 12:25.198
Apparently you're having
trouble fitting in.

12:25.232 --> 12:27.533
Who... who... who are... who are you?

12:27.567 --> 12:29.434
Oh, my name is David.

12:29.469 --> 12:31.737
Are you... like a doctor or something?

12:31.771 --> 12:32.905
A psychologist?

12:32.939 --> 12:34.740
Am I what? N-uh, no.

12:34.774 --> 12:37.910
So why would I talk to you?

12:37.944 --> 12:41.079
I don't know. Because
your teacher is concerned

12:41.114 --> 12:42.848
that you're having trouble adjusting.

12:42.883 --> 12:46.451
So she told you to come here
and... and what, help... help me?

12:46.486 --> 12:49.888
Look at you. Look at your pants.

12:49.922 --> 12:52.456
Excuse me! I am sensing a
tinge of disrespect here.

12:52.491 --> 12:54.025
I'll tell you what my problem is.

12:54.059 --> 12:55.860
I'm a 16-year-old gay kid

12:55.895 --> 12:58.462
living in a town that
makes me wanna throw up.

12:58.497 --> 12:59.998
The issue isn't me not fitting in.

13:00.032 --> 13:03.401
It's me not wanting to fit in.

13:03.435 --> 13:07.404
Is there anything else you
wanna, you wanna help me with?

13:10.525 --> 13:11.441
No.

13:26.158 --> 13:29.159
Go ahead and order whatever
you want. This is on us.

13:29.193 --> 13:32.362
Oh. They're letting you
run up a long tab, are they?

13:32.396 --> 13:34.497
You see?

13:34.532 --> 13:37.067
Well, I hear the pork is very good here.

13:37.101 --> 13:40.070
The ribs, the chops, the roast...

13:40.104 --> 13:42.135
Nothing for me, thanks.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.107
Well, isn't that funny. Because
Moira doesn't eat here either.

13:45.141 --> 13:46.876
But I will be eating and I just don't know

13:46.910 --> 13:49.078
whether to have the ribs or the chops,

13:49.112 --> 13:51.280
but I'm definitely ordering pork.

13:51.314 --> 13:53.549
If you mention pork one more time...

13:53.584 --> 13:55.885
Moira, um... don't you have something

13:55.919 --> 13:57.152
you wanna say to your sister?

13:57.187 --> 13:58.554
No.

13:58.589 --> 14:00.322
Oh, I'm pretty sure you do.

14:00.356 --> 14:02.424
I'm pretty sure I don't.

14:02.459 --> 14:04.726
Thank you for trying, Johnny. Truly.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.928
But like I'm just really
uncomfortable right now

14:06.963 --> 14:09.564
with my older sister acting
like a stubborn child.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.900
Okay, why don't we all
take a deep breath here

14:11.934 --> 14:16.337
and try and remember what's
really important, okay?

14:16.371 --> 14:20.523
We are family, and we
have to hang onto that.

14:21.510 --> 14:22.810
And you know as well as I do, Moira,

14:22.844 --> 14:24.612
that in times of crisis,

14:24.646 --> 14:28.181
the one thing we need
to hang onto is family.

14:28.316 --> 14:29.416
Okay, okay.

14:29.450 --> 14:31.618
Deedee...

14:34.789 --> 14:37.724
We appreciate you coming to this town...

14:37.758 --> 14:41.261
And offering whatever
it is you're offering.

14:41.295 --> 14:43.363
Much appreciated. 'Cause seriously,

14:43.397 --> 14:44.598
I thought you were just
coming here to gloat.

14:44.632 --> 14:46.633
No, no, no.

14:46.667 --> 14:50.604
I came here in the spirit
of giving and forgiving.

14:50.638 --> 14:53.406
The... the gloating thing was a bonus.

14:53.441 --> 14:55.571
Moira, go on...

14:57.278 --> 14:59.778
Yes, go on.

15:05.051 --> 15:08.687
We need help. Please help us.

15:11.658 --> 15:16.861
Okay! I will. Hmm?

15:16.963 --> 15:20.098
Oh!

15:20.133 --> 15:22.567
I'm gonna do this for you, but
mostly, I'm doing it for me.

15:22.601 --> 15:25.370
Why? Because you can't... And I can.

15:25.404 --> 15:27.272
Okay.

15:28.875 --> 15:30.575
How much are we gonna make this out for?

15:30.609 --> 15:34.112
Oh... sh... I haven't the
foggiest. I couldn't...

15:34.147 --> 15:35.647
I couldn't come up with a number.

15:35.681 --> 15:39.184
I mean, I... whatever you think is fair.

15:39.218 --> 15:41.518
Well, you guys gave me fifty grand, right?

15:41.552 --> 15:45.956
Yes, we gave you fifty
thousand when we had the money.

15:45.991 --> 15:51.095
But I can't... I can't ask
you for fifty thousand dollars.

15:51.129 --> 15:54.999
Whatever you think is
the... Equivalent amount.

15:55.033 --> 15:57.902
Okay, I think I can do you...

15:57.936 --> 15:59.636
A little better than that.

15:59.671 --> 16:01.138
Okay?

16:06.711 --> 16:13.268
Oh, so... unnecessary,
Deedee, but thank you.

16:14.552 --> 16:17.621
Well, who's up for pork?

16:17.655 --> 16:19.790
Okay... so you're telling me

16:19.824 --> 16:22.257
your girlfriend is on
a date with someone else

16:22.292 --> 16:24.192
and, instead of doing something about it,

16:24.227 --> 16:26.361
you're here talking to me,

16:26.396 --> 16:28.431
a kid who practically
has no respect for you.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.866
Well, first of all, you're a little bitchy.

16:30.901 --> 16:33.268
Second of all, she is not my girlfriend.

16:33.303 --> 16:35.404
She's someone I'm
occasionally having sex with

16:35.439 --> 16:37.907
because we're bored and desperate.

16:37.941 --> 16:41.009
Ah... you're doing a friends with
benefits thing with this girl.

16:41.044 --> 16:43.010
Have you not seen the 42
films they've made about it?

16:43.045 --> 16:45.780
It never works.

16:45.815 --> 16:48.416
Okay, well, movies aren't
always right, all right?

16:48.451 --> 16:49.731
You'll learn that later in life.

16:49.752 --> 16:51.619
I happen to be a little bit
older than you are, so...

16:51.654 --> 16:53.120
- Obviously.
- Okay.

16:53.155 --> 16:54.355
Well, I think we're good here.

16:57.259 --> 16:59.461
You're gonna be okay, right? You're stable?

16:59.495 --> 17:01.495
I have a party later.
Can you buy me some beer?

17:01.529 --> 17:04.380
Uh, no. Can you buy me some beer?!

17:14.943 --> 17:17.478
Hey! Can I grab a glass of water?

17:17.512 --> 17:19.311
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

17:19.347 --> 17:21.513
So how's the uh... song going?

17:21.548 --> 17:23.148
Is that... Is the song still a thing?

17:23.184 --> 17:25.452
Yeah! Do you wanna hear some of it?

17:25.486 --> 17:28.588
Um, I would love to, but
I actually hate music,

17:28.622 --> 17:30.723
so... I don't think I'd
be a very good judge.

17:30.757 --> 17:33.193
- You hate music?
- Mm-hmm...

17:33.227 --> 17:35.308
Are we sure that Mutt likes music?

17:35.333 --> 17:38.498
'Cause I feel like if he didn't
it could be kind of... awkward.

17:38.532 --> 17:40.566
Are you feeling okay?

17:40.601 --> 17:46.331
Um... I just don't think that...
The song thing is a good idea.

17:46.539 --> 17:49.674
For, like, a lot of reasons.

17:49.709 --> 17:51.543
Um... are you sure that
you wanna put yourself

17:51.577 --> 17:54.346
in such a vulnerable situation, Twy?

17:54.381 --> 17:56.548
Are you saying you don't
think Mutt would like it?

17:56.582 --> 18:00.119
I don't know. I mean... I'm not sure.

18:00.153 --> 18:02.086
Maybe, but... I don't... I'm not...

18:02.121 --> 18:04.022
yeah, I'm not sure.

18:04.056 --> 18:06.491
Did you talk to Mutt?
Because I know that...

18:06.525 --> 18:08.426
We've been sort of off for a while.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.294
And I've been just trying to
think of things to make it better

18:10.329 --> 18:12.529
and so I'm... you know, I'm
just trying to make it work.

18:15.334 --> 18:18.369
I think that you should
talk to Mutt before...

18:18.404 --> 18:20.071
Breaking into song.

18:26.344 --> 18:28.945
Thank you, Alexis.

18:28.979 --> 18:31.415
For what?

18:31.449 --> 18:32.882
Bye.

18:44.494 --> 18:48.344
In all honesty, Mutt
was just a place holder.

18:48.369 --> 18:51.233
According to my tea leaves, the guy
I'm suppose to marry is black, so...

18:54.406 --> 18:55.337
Oh.

18:55.372 --> 18:57.740
- What and why are we drinking?
- Oh my goodness!

18:57.775 --> 19:01.444
Um, I don't know, and today,
some snippy teen told me

19:01.478 --> 19:03.479
that my life was a mess, so...

19:03.513 --> 19:06.427
And I am now a single person.

19:06.816 --> 19:09.107
Oh...

19:09.132 --> 19:12.788
So did you spend the night washing
your clothes on Grant's abs?

19:12.822 --> 19:14.790
- You're funny.
- Mm-hmm.

19:14.824 --> 19:16.925
Um, Grant went to the
bathroom and never came back.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.494
- Thank you.
- What?

19:18.528 --> 19:20.488
He w... he went to the
bathroom and never came back?

19:20.497 --> 19:22.364
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh...

19:22.399 --> 19:24.433
So either I was stood up
halfway through my date

19:24.468 --> 19:27.703
or Grant has some serious digestive issues.

19:27.737 --> 19:30.639
- Mm.
- Wow. Sounds like a real catch.

19:33.476 --> 19:37.579
So word on teen street
is that our little...

19:37.614 --> 19:41.216
Friends with benefits situation is a...

19:41.250 --> 19:43.852
- Not a good idea?
- Is a bad idea.

19:43.886 --> 19:45.920
And because I don't have
any other friends here,

19:45.954 --> 19:48.556
I can't afford to lose you, so...

19:48.591 --> 19:50.358
I think it's best if we just...

19:50.392 --> 19:51.326
- Friends.
- Friends. Yup.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.228
I think that's best.

19:53.262 --> 19:55.196
Good. This is good.

19:55.231 --> 19:56.431
- That's good, right?
- That's good.

19:56.465 --> 19:59.534
Okay. Well... Warmest wishes to that.

19:59.568 --> 20:00.635
Kindest regards.

20:00.669 --> 20:02.003
Yeah!

20:02.037 --> 20:03.904
Cheers!

20:06.807 --> 20:09.343
- Whoa. Twy...
- Mm...

20:09.377 --> 20:11.845
- That's...
- It's good, right?

20:11.879 --> 20:14.027
My eyes are tearing.

20:15.371 --> 20:17.706
So this is it?

20:17.741 --> 20:19.508
After all that?

20:22.782 --> 20:25.550
And we paid for the dinner!

20:25.575 --> 20:27.576
So we lost money on the whole deal.

20:31.838 --> 20:35.241
I'll tell ya, she's gonna be embarrassed

20:35.266 --> 20:37.295
when this thing gets cashed.

20:37.320 --> 20:41.514
She will be embarrassed. She missed a zero.

20:42.100 --> 20:44.358
Moira, she missed a zero or two.

20:46.135 --> 20:48.502
I... you know what?

20:48.537 --> 20:50.003
I'm gonna call her. I'm
calling her right now,

20:50.038 --> 20:53.150
that... What a cheap-ass amount!

20:53.175 --> 20:55.775
Turn your light off, John.

20:58.536 --> 21:01.005
Your sister is a cheap ass.

21:14.820 --> 21:16.093
Cheap ass.

21:18.962 --> 21:21.771
We're planning a surprise

21:21.796 --> 21:22.796
party for your mother.

21:22.797 --> 21:24.530
Listen to the words
coming out of your mouth.

21:24.532 --> 21:25.397
Then you plan it.

21:25.399 --> 21:26.231
No!

21:26.233 --> 21:27.366
Oh, he snap-diva'd!

21:27.368 --> 21:28.434
Talk to the hand, son,

21:28.436 --> 21:30.770
because the ears are no longer working.

21:30.772 --> 21:31.804
Oh my God.

21:31.806 --> 21:34.507
Okay, that's not at all how that works.
