WEBVTT

00:02.740 --> 00:04.580
Excuse me, sir. Do you work here?

00:05.600 --> 00:07.140
Barry, it's me.

00:07.170 --> 00:08.500
- It's Hank.
- I know it's Hank!

00:09.000 --> 00:10.920
- In a wig.
- I know you're in a wig!

00:12.380 --> 00:14.900
- Mr. Cousineau.
- Gene is in pain.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.710
He needs time to process what happened.

00:16.720 --> 00:17.939
Janice was murdered.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.140
I have come to offer you a proposition.

00:21.210 --> 00:22.300
Sweet baby Jesus!

00:22.340 --> 00:24.980
How can we not want to be
in business with this, huh?

00:25.040 --> 00:27.120
Esther is throwing
complete monkey wrench

00:27.140 --> 00:28.480
into my relationship with Cristobal.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.180
So you kill her. Classic crisscross.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.210
That's not a crisscross.

00:31.250 --> 00:34.040
Oh, thank God you're here!

00:34.050 --> 00:35.059
Mr. Fuches...

00:35.060 --> 00:37.200
You got a court order to take my DNA?

00:38.840 --> 00:40.970
We just got a DNA match on CODIS.

00:40.980 --> 00:43.210
Monroe Fuches. Cleveland.

00:43.290 --> 00:44.460
Ohio!

01:11.330 --> 01:12.700
Barry.

01:14.210 --> 01:15.920
- Barry.
- What?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.280
Ground Control to Major Barry.

01:18.330 --> 01:20.420
Are you listening, man?

01:20.500 --> 01:24.170
That troll Esther is pulling fast one.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.920
So Burmese come to America

01:25.960 --> 01:27.960
pretending to be
persecuted Buddhist monks.

01:28.540 --> 01:30.920
They ask government for
the religious asylum,

01:30.940 --> 01:33.710
then live here in temple until
they are clear from immigration.

01:33.790 --> 01:36.290
Then, they join Burmese mafia.

01:36.380 --> 01:38.720
Whole monastery is gateway
for soldiers and drugs.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.440
That's actually kind of a genius plan.

01:40.470 --> 01:41.850
No. It's not genius.

01:41.880 --> 01:43.400
She is not a genius, okay?

01:43.420 --> 01:45.240
It's an okay plan. It's fine.

01:45.280 --> 01:47.540
And I guarantee you, she
did not come up with it.

01:47.630 --> 01:48.920
I mean, look at her.

01:49.020 --> 01:51.960
And look at Cristobal's face.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.830
That is a cry for help.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.440
So you get in there,
you shoot her in her

01:56.470 --> 02:00.330
crazy watermelon-sized head with...

02:00.420 --> 02:02.879
this.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.960
My family sent it to me as threat.

02:06.040 --> 02:09.710
Now, if it came back with
Esther's blood on it,

02:09.789 --> 02:12.880
phew, massive fumble turnover for Hank.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.280
Came back with her blood
on it? What do you mean?

02:15.300 --> 02:18.080
I don't know how... You
want me to get the bullet

02:18.170 --> 02:19.700
out of her head, is that
what you're saying?

02:19.740 --> 02:21.980
- Yeah.
- I don't know how I'd do that.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.440
- That's not how bullets work.
- Okay, um...

02:24.470 --> 02:26.420
Dummy's version: What if you shoot her

02:26.440 --> 02:27.960
with a thick book behind her?

02:28.040 --> 02:30.840
It'll go through her head, get
stuck in book, you open up book,

02:30.860 --> 02:32.380
- take out bullet, simple.
- No, no.

02:32.460 --> 02:33.500
- It's so simple.
- That's not...

02:33.520 --> 02:35.500
So you're saying is I
need to get her to read

02:35.520 --> 02:38.220
a really thick book, and
then while she's reading,

02:38.240 --> 02:40.060
I shoot her in the back of the
head, is that what you're saying?

02:40.100 --> 02:41.760
- Okay. Yeah. I see what you're saying.
- You see what I'm saying?

02:41.800 --> 02:44.300
That's a hat on a hat, so... right.

02:44.360 --> 02:48.250
Regardless, everyone has to
know this is job done by Hank.

02:48.330 --> 02:50.040
So, come on, take it.

02:55.080 --> 02:56.880
Am I evil?

02:58.400 --> 02:59.460
Huh?

02:59.500 --> 03:01.920
Am I like an...

03:02.000 --> 03:04.300
Am I like, like an evil person?

03:06.140 --> 03:07.920
Oh, my God!

03:08.000 --> 03:10.150
I mean, absolutely.

03:10.180 --> 03:11.540
Do I not tell you that enough?

03:11.630 --> 03:14.620
You are like the most
evil guy I know, man!

03:14.660 --> 03:16.860
You know I take no pleasure
in killing people.

03:16.880 --> 03:17.890
You know that, right?

03:17.920 --> 03:19.880
Man, all this talking
has made me hungry.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.420
You know what I could really go for?

03:22.500 --> 03:24.620
Yoshinoya beef bowl.

03:26.580 --> 03:31.360

03:31.380 --> 03:34.210
What the fuck?

03:38.020 --> 03:40.420
Hey, Loach. Ooh, look at that smile!

03:40.500 --> 03:42.580
Is that your ex?

03:42.670 --> 03:45.130
Who is that... Oh, that's the new guy.

03:45.210 --> 03:47.980
He's cute. It must be weird, though.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.050
You kind of want them to
end up with a dog, right?

03:50.080 --> 03:52.200
Mae, what did I tell you about
coming in to my office?

03:54.330 --> 03:56.210
To step out.

03:56.220 --> 03:58.140
Um, okay.

03:58.170 --> 03:59.460
Knock, knock.

03:59.480 --> 04:00.790
I'm ready to go on that trip.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.920
- All packed.
- Cool. What trip?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.980
Uh, to Cleveland to go
interview that Fuches guy.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.200
You're not going to Cleveland.

04:07.220 --> 04:08.900
What? You can't go alone.

04:08.920 --> 04:10.160
That would be a breach of protocol.

04:10.180 --> 04:11.760
Look, Moss was my partner.

04:11.790 --> 04:14.400
This is personal to me, and
you have to respect that.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.560
All right? I'm doing this alone.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.300
Is that all you're taking, though?

04:19.320 --> 04:21.079
Did your wife take all the luggage?

04:28.380 --> 04:29.720
I'm sorry to tell you,

04:29.740 --> 04:33.350
but one of the twins smothered
the other twin in the womb.

04:33.380 --> 04:36.120
- No...
- Why would God allow this to happen?

04:36.160 --> 04:38.380
Maybe he only wanted
us to have one child...

04:38.460 --> 04:39.480
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.570
... a girl.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.460
What's going on?

04:42.540 --> 04:45.120
Everyone was so jealous of
your performance last class,

04:45.140 --> 04:47.580
that they wanted to
share their own pain.

04:47.670 --> 04:49.680
It's like competitive grief.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.250
We'll name her...

04:51.330 --> 04:53.170
Natalie.

04:56.420 --> 04:59.220
Okay. Got him.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.250
All right, I know you
were just a fetus...

05:01.280 --> 05:02.320
Right.

05:02.340 --> 05:05.500
... but is this close
to your experience?

05:05.580 --> 05:07.940
From what I remember, yes.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.620
Shh!

05:09.680 --> 05:12.680
- Okay, who's next?
- Yo, me, Antonio.

05:12.700 --> 05:16.290
Oh, I cannot wait to eat this taco.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.830
Oh, no, I spill hot sauce on my ankle.

05:18.920 --> 05:22.000
¡Ay, Dios mío!

05:22.080 --> 05:24.360
Eric... Eric, stop.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.540
Doctor, will my leg be all right?

05:29.630 --> 05:32.080
Your pit bull bit through
your lower leg tendon.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.000
- Achilles.
- Achilles.

05:34.030 --> 05:36.560
Your professional soccer
career is over. I'm sorry.

05:36.580 --> 05:39.980
Ay!

05:40.000 --> 05:43.880
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.

05:44.460 --> 05:45.790
Son...

05:45.880 --> 05:48.520
Your mother and I want you to
know we're getting a divorce.

05:48.560 --> 05:52.300
It's not your fault.
We've just grown apart.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.020
We'll always love you, baby Eric.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.840
Now get these dead bodies out of here,

05:57.880 --> 05:59.630
you fucked up serial killer.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.160
That's not what happened!

06:02.190 --> 06:05.570
Great day! What a journey
you all took us on, huh?

06:05.590 --> 06:08.120
A lot of doctors giving
us a lot of bad news.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.640
I don't know if your work
rose to yesterday's level

06:11.660 --> 06:13.090
from our good friend Barry here.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.180
Well, he was in a war.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.380
So lucky.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.220
Yes, Barry was blessed

06:18.250 --> 06:21.360
with being able to witness the
atrocities of war, absolutely.

06:21.400 --> 06:25.630
I bet you all wish you were
down in the shit with him.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.620
But here's the difference.

06:28.880 --> 06:33.050
Barry, you told your story
with such vulnerability,

06:33.080 --> 06:35.260
such honesty.

06:35.340 --> 06:37.930
Look, I know it is
hard to see yourselves

06:37.950 --> 06:40.200
reflected in the exercises up here.

06:40.260 --> 06:44.800
What if we challenged ourselves
to discover ourselves?

06:44.820 --> 06:48.000
What if we wrote our own pieces,

06:48.080 --> 06:50.590
using moments from our own lives

06:50.620 --> 06:52.440
that help shape and define us?

06:52.470 --> 06:54.960
What if we didn't elevate

06:54.980 --> 06:57.300
somebody else's character
in somebody else's story

06:57.320 --> 06:59.580
but we finally wrote our own?

06:59.600 --> 07:04.010
What if we made it about
ourselves for a change?

07:04.090 --> 07:05.970
- Yes.
- Now, Barry,

07:06.050 --> 07:08.200
you're gonna tell that
story from Afghanistan.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.360
The rest of you, you're gonna
find your sheep-fucker moments.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.760
And then we'll take them all,

07:12.790 --> 07:15.080
we will mold them into a show

07:15.100 --> 07:16.580
that we will do for a paying audience

07:16.600 --> 07:18.780
and the occasional VIP comp.

07:18.820 --> 07:21.759
Now, this is the new work,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.100
Are you with me?

07:25.300 --> 07:28.760
- Well, let's get to it!
- Yes, Gene!

07:28.840 --> 07:30.279
Sally, excuse me.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.560
Where are you going?
You haven't gone yet.

07:31.580 --> 07:33.900
Oh, yeah. Shit, sorry.
Can I go next class?

07:33.920 --> 07:37.680
It's just, I have a meeting
to go to at Gersh.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.780
Are you telling me that
that is more important

07:39.800 --> 07:41.680
than sharing your truth with the class?

07:41.760 --> 07:44.510
It's just my new agents
have put together my reel

07:44.590 --> 07:46.300
of all the jobs I've been getting,

07:46.330 --> 07:48.680
like clips of them, like, cut together.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.090
- We know what a reel is.
- I'm really excited.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.240
Sorry. You guys were great, though.

07:52.270 --> 07:53.500
It was really, really good.

07:53.580 --> 07:57.620
You know what? To the rest
of you, take a loose 15.

07:58.130 --> 08:01.300
But, like, I'm not surprised
that she did that.

08:09.520 --> 08:13.640
_

08:32.820 --> 08:34.799
Hey, Mr. Cousineau?

08:34.880 --> 08:36.929
Hey, Private Pyle. How you doing?

08:36.960 --> 08:39.090
Oh, let's not call me that.

08:39.179 --> 08:42.260
Your story, just an idea...

08:42.320 --> 08:45.040
There is an embellishment
called the Dennehy Balloon.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.880
Actually, it's a colostomy
bag filled with blood

08:47.900 --> 08:49.900
that Brian Dennehy used
during Death Trap.

08:49.950 --> 08:53.510
When he was shot, he would...

08:55.340 --> 08:58.660
Mr. Cousineau, um, I don't
really have to tell the story

08:58.680 --> 09:01.090
I told yesterday in front
of an audience, do I?

09:01.180 --> 09:03.130
- Of course not.
- Oh, good. Thank you.

09:03.170 --> 09:04.760
No, that version is just the beginning.

09:04.790 --> 09:06.600
- Shit.
- See during rehearsal...

09:06.620 --> 09:07.960
and this is just my instinct...

09:07.980 --> 09:11.590
you're gonna find more complicated
and fucked up details.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.630
Those... we have to hear.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.200
Right, but you know, you
said that this is a story

09:16.220 --> 09:18.080
- that, um, has to define us.
- Mm-hmm.

09:18.140 --> 09:22.090
I just... I don't think
that's the person that I am.

09:22.180 --> 09:24.540
- Barry, you're justifiably nervous.
- Yeah.

09:24.560 --> 09:28.990
But I will not hear a word about
switching it out, one iota,

09:29.010 --> 09:31.010
for something less compelling.

09:31.090 --> 09:34.260
You, sir, are doing Afghanistan.

09:36.260 --> 09:38.240
See, I want to do the
story about meeting you.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.450
Go on.

09:39.480 --> 09:42.880
Yeah, you know, being in this
class and seeing you teach and...

09:42.920 --> 09:46.200
So you wanna tell the
story of meeting me?

09:46.220 --> 09:47.240
Yeah.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.080
I'll allow it.

09:49.160 --> 09:51.860
Oh, good. That's great. That's great.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.440
I think it will be way
better than Afghanistan.

09:53.470 --> 09:55.670
I can be as involved
as you need me to be

09:55.700 --> 09:59.080
in order to craft this piece,
or I can stay on the sidelines.

09:59.130 --> 10:01.200
I totally understand.
Either way is fine.

10:01.220 --> 10:03.220
- Okay, I don't think I need...
- But who would know

10:03.240 --> 10:05.220
more about me than me?

10:05.260 --> 10:06.420
That's a good point,

10:06.440 --> 10:08.400
but I don't think you need to
be involved at all, you know?

10:08.430 --> 10:10.840
- I was there, so I remember.
- I've got scrapbooks.

10:10.930 --> 10:12.260
- Oh, cool.
- If you need them.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.400
I've got diaries, I've got
pictures, I've got tapes.

10:14.430 --> 10:17.200
Barry, I have got a lot of tapes.

10:17.220 --> 10:18.300
I think I'm good,

10:18.320 --> 10:20.050
- Mr. Cousineau, thank you. Thank you.
- Okay.

10:20.130 --> 10:22.320
You know what? I'm gonna
call Natalie and send her

10:22.340 --> 10:24.510
- to the storage unit anyway.
- Okay.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.680
- All right. Okay.
- Just in case.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.720
- For the tapes. Okay.
- Got it.

10:30.220 --> 10:32.500
If anyone calls or knocks on the door,

10:32.520 --> 10:34.480
- you just ignore them, okay?
- Okay.

10:34.510 --> 10:36.510
You and Emily just sit tight.

10:36.590 --> 10:38.880
And before you know it,
this'll all be over.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.820
There must be something
I can do to help.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.590
There is.

10:44.970 --> 10:46.510
Let me handle this.

10:49.580 --> 10:54.360
You've had to overcome
a lot of misogyny,

10:54.390 --> 10:59.300
adversity, sexism to
get to where you are.

10:59.380 --> 11:01.640
Nothing's been handed to you.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.970
You've earned it.

11:04.050 --> 11:05.680
Congratulations, ladies.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.740
You're my lead prosecutors now.

11:07.780 --> 11:09.840
We won't let you down,
District Attorney McGarrity.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.380
I know you won't. Now...

11:12.470 --> 11:15.940
- Sir, your three o'clock is here.
- Tell them to wait!

11:16.000 --> 11:18.400
I'm talking to my lead prosecutors.

11:18.440 --> 11:21.560
- Sorry about her.
- How did they not pick this up?

11:21.620 --> 11:22.980
_

11:23.000 --> 11:24.630
Sar Norff's men have
surrounded our ship.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.090
How are we gonna get home, Dad?

11:26.180 --> 11:27.590
We'll just have to make a run for it.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.220
Make a run for it? If
we do that, we're dead.

11:32.450 --> 11:35.060
_

11:35.080 --> 11:36.380
Thanks, Babe.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.130
Woo!

11:41.140 --> 11:42.760
So great.

11:42.780 --> 11:44.720
You are nailing these scenes.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.510
It's like I forgot you were acting.

11:46.590 --> 11:49.260
You became the character
of... what was her name?

11:49.340 --> 11:52.050
Oh, the script just said "wife."

11:52.130 --> 11:54.380
Well, you elevated it. Look, we love it.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.670
But forget how we feel.

11:55.690 --> 11:57.700
How do you feel? Be honest.

11:59.180 --> 12:01.180
It's... so great. Thank you so much.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.220
I mean, I feel so lucky. Thank you.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.220
Well, you are booking like crazy.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.470
You gotta come by more.

12:06.550 --> 12:07.820
- All right.
- Yeah.

12:07.850 --> 12:10.380
Sorry to keep this brief,
but Mike and I have to run.

12:10.470 --> 12:12.180
They'll validate you at the front.

12:12.260 --> 12:14.320
- You know how to get out, right?
- Uh, yeah.

12:14.340 --> 12:17.630
Sally, you stay. You two go
on ahead, I'll walk her out.

12:17.660 --> 12:19.630
So fucking thrilled.

12:26.760 --> 12:27.980
You hate it.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.700
I just, like...

12:30.720 --> 12:33.000
Seeing it all cut together
like that, back-to-back...

12:33.020 --> 12:36.000
Look, these parts are not the best
representation of your talent.

12:36.020 --> 12:40.140
I just feel like I have more to
bring to the table than breakfast.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.680
"Breakfast."

12:42.760 --> 12:45.220
That's amazing. I'm crazy about you.

12:45.300 --> 12:46.960
And I just want you to be happy.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.020
Okay.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.600
Um, so what do we do?

12:52.090 --> 12:53.630
Here's what we do...

12:55.090 --> 12:57.050
We play the game.

12:57.130 --> 12:58.970
Okay, okay. Hear me out.

12:59.050 --> 13:02.010
Before Jennifer Lawrence became "J-Law,"

13:02.090 --> 13:06.050
she was the daughter on the
Bill Engvall sitcom, okay?

13:06.130 --> 13:07.470
Okay.

13:07.550 --> 13:11.400
Good parts come with time,
but you gotta hang in there.

13:11.430 --> 13:13.220
I know it's so frustrating,

13:13.300 --> 13:15.930
but it's the way this industry works.

13:16.010 --> 13:17.840
- Okay?
- Okay.

13:17.930 --> 13:20.050
- Is that the plan?
- Yeah.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.340
- Yeah, that's the plan.
- Okay.

13:22.430 --> 13:25.090
- Thank you, Lindsay.
- You bet, yeah.

13:28.420 --> 13:31.340
Hey. Monroe Fuches.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.970
Thank you.

13:39.550 --> 13:40.660
Monroe Fuches?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.550
No.

13:44.630 --> 13:46.720
Detective Loach, LAPD.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.510
Just like to ask you a few questions.

13:50.340 --> 13:52.970
Yeah.

13:54.260 --> 13:56.180
So, Mr. Fuches,

13:56.260 --> 14:01.220
I have your tooth at the scene
of a quadruple homicide.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.010
How does that happen?

14:04.720 --> 14:06.090
You know, that's funny.

14:06.180 --> 14:09.180
I was gonna call the cops about that.

14:09.220 --> 14:11.880
Uh, my tooth... this one.

14:11.970 --> 14:15.050
I woke up, and it was gone.

14:15.130 --> 14:17.050
I have no idea where it went.

14:17.130 --> 14:18.440
You have no idea where it went?

14:18.470 --> 14:20.380
No idea.

14:24.040 --> 14:27.260
Okay. All right. I'm
not gonna lie to you.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.360
I was with a lady.

14:29.380 --> 14:35.150
And I think, maybe,
while I was sleeping...

14:35.180 --> 14:37.180
she extracted it.

14:39.050 --> 14:40.470
Why would she do that?

14:40.550 --> 14:43.580
Who knows what these
foreign prostitutes do?

14:43.600 --> 14:46.470
I mean she might've taken
it as some sort of...

14:46.550 --> 14:48.270
trophy or something?

14:48.280 --> 14:51.270
You know, like an ivory
tusk or a rhino horn.

14:51.300 --> 14:54.370
Maybe she wanted to grind it
up and use it as a potion.

14:54.380 --> 14:56.930
I don't know what goes on with them.

14:59.140 --> 15:01.840
So...

15:01.930 --> 15:04.720
- in this scenario...
- Uh-huh?

15:04.800 --> 15:08.040
how does it end up in Pazar's garage?

15:09.000 --> 15:12.300
Hmm, well...

15:12.380 --> 15:15.500
Uh, she might've taken it with her

15:15.520 --> 15:17.780
- on her route and left it there.
- Uh-huh.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.220
I don't think they have routes.

15:21.620 --> 15:22.920
Well, I mean suit yourself.

15:22.940 --> 15:25.660
But if I'm a cop, I want to
look at all the possibilities.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.400
Hey, do you know this guy?

15:32.880 --> 15:34.930
Is that a guy?

15:35.010 --> 15:37.720
Looks kind of gender-liquid to me.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.200
Well, his name is Barry Block,

15:39.220 --> 15:42.260
but his real name is Barry Berkman.

15:42.340 --> 15:45.380
And he's from right here
in Cleveland, like you.

15:46.590 --> 15:48.420
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

15:48.540 --> 15:51.520
Yeah, well I've never seen
him before in my life.

15:52.640 --> 15:53.970
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.590
So you, you definitely...

15:56.680 --> 16:00.300
you definitely didn't
see him kill Pazar.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.720
I don't know this dipshit,

16:02.800 --> 16:05.720
and I don't give a fuck about Pazar.

16:05.800 --> 16:06.920
Yeah.

16:06.970 --> 16:10.180
I don't give a fuck about Pazar, either.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.430
You know what I do care about?

16:14.680 --> 16:17.470
I care about who killed my partner,

16:17.550 --> 16:20.180
Detective Janice Moss.

16:20.260 --> 16:25.900
And I think this guy might've
had something to do with it.

16:27.140 --> 16:29.300
He might be a cop killer.

16:30.340 --> 16:34.880
And if I find out that you're
even slightly involved

16:34.900 --> 16:36.720
with this fucking guy,

16:36.800 --> 16:40.630
like in any way, shape, or form,

16:40.720 --> 16:43.240
you're going to prison.

16:43.380 --> 16:45.430
You got me?

16:46.970 --> 16:48.930
No, no, no, no. Come on.

16:49.010 --> 16:51.630
Come on! I fucking pushed the button!

16:51.650 --> 16:53.780
- The game says you didn't.
- Well, that's bullshit,

16:53.800 --> 16:56.050
because I'm obviously
pushing the button.

16:56.070 --> 16:59.180
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, roomie. Not now, okay?

16:59.200 --> 17:00.880
I got bread, mac and cheese,

17:00.920 --> 17:02.670
and, Jermaine, I got your Gatorade.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.430
Sweet. Thanks, B.

17:04.510 --> 17:07.859
Um, I'm actually a little light.
Can I get you tomorrow?

17:09.359 --> 17:10.760
Sure, yeah.

17:10.839 --> 17:13.089
- Word.
- Aw, goddamn, it's happened again!

17:13.180 --> 17:15.060
Yeah, you really aren't good at this.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.130
Hi, Dad.

18:28.220 --> 18:30.630
Leo, hi!

18:30.720 --> 18:35.050
Oh, what a lovely coincidence!

18:35.130 --> 18:36.740
I don't know if you know this,

18:36.760 --> 18:40.340
but I've just recently lost
someone very close to me.

18:40.430 --> 18:41.720
Mom told me.

18:41.750 --> 18:45.880
And I thought to myself, you
know, life is so short.

18:45.930 --> 18:48.820
A father should have a
relationship with his son.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.520
Okay.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.639
Were you planned? No.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.720
But then there you were.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.620
So I did what every great
actor does, I improvised.

19:05.650 --> 19:06.740
You left.

19:06.760 --> 19:10.720
Look, you want to leave them
wanting more, not less.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.440
And then there was my work, my students.

19:13.470 --> 19:16.920
Your fucking students. Okay...

19:19.090 --> 19:22.520
Look, you're jealous, Leo.
It's totally natural.

19:22.540 --> 19:25.080
I don't care about your
students and neither do you.

19:25.130 --> 19:27.470
That whole theater is
just a big shrine to you.

19:27.550 --> 19:29.720
Even this is about you.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.590
We don't have a relationship, Dad,

19:32.680 --> 19:35.130
and I'm fine with that, I really am.

19:37.220 --> 19:39.300
No reason to force this.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.180
Barry, you are worthless and weak.

20:02.780 --> 20:05.720
Do you hear me, Barry,
you cemented head?

20:05.750 --> 20:06.980
Yes, Mr. Cousineau.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.840
Are you aware you are
incapable of playing

20:09.880 --> 20:12.430
a character with a mil...

20:12.510 --> 20:14.630
mildest set of balls?

20:14.720 --> 20:17.280
I think it's because I've never
had an adult male role model,

20:17.300 --> 20:19.860
so I don't have the emotional
tools to advocate for myself.

20:22.050 --> 20:24.780
I know, Barry. I'm going
to give you those tools,

20:24.800 --> 20:26.630
and thus change your life.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.400
It's going to be incredible,

20:28.420 --> 20:30.220
and I'm going to owe it all to you.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.960
I am Gene. This is my
theater. It's what I do.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.630
Barry...

20:34.720 --> 20:37.700
Hey, Mr. Cousineau! Mr. Cousineau.

20:37.720 --> 20:39.780
Yeah, we just put this up on its feet.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.810
- It's feeling pretty good.
- Yeah.

20:40.830 --> 20:42.880
Yeah, we had a ques...
What was the, um...

20:42.900 --> 20:44.380
- Balls.
- Oh, yeah.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.300
Did you say I have no nuts

20:46.380 --> 20:48.180
or that I have no balls?

20:48.220 --> 20:49.840
We just wanna make sure it's accurate.

20:49.930 --> 20:52.680
Barry, you're gonna do the
story from Afghanistan.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.970
- What?
- Just be your real self.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.120
Afghanistan.

20:59.260 --> 21:01.550
I don't think he liked your performance.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.550
He's not wrong.

21:04.630 --> 21:07.930
I mean, thank God Lindsay's
on my team, you know?

21:08.010 --> 21:09.280
Because my other two agents,

21:09.300 --> 21:11.340
Mike and Michael, they
just don't get me.

21:11.430 --> 21:14.590
I mean, they keep sending me up
for these shitty little parts.

21:14.680 --> 21:18.090
It hurts that they don't think that
I'm ready for something bigger.

21:18.180 --> 21:20.800
So your burden is that
you're booking work?

21:20.880 --> 21:22.970
Okay, fair. I'm booking, yeah,

21:23.050 --> 21:26.840
but, you know, nothing
substantial, nothing meaty.

21:26.930 --> 21:30.680
Just like... housewife,
stepmother, assistant.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.020
Nothing I can really bring
my truth to, you know?

21:33.040 --> 21:34.960
Just a bunch of weak women.

21:34.980 --> 21:36.510
Oh, you don't like weak women.

21:36.590 --> 21:38.200
You can't bring your truth to them.

21:39.100 --> 21:42.090
- No.
- Why?

21:42.180 --> 21:44.220
I...

21:44.300 --> 21:46.510
What do you mean, "Why?"

21:46.590 --> 21:48.620
I'm a very self-sufficient person.

21:53.380 --> 21:56.630
Well, I, um... I'm
extremely independent.

21:58.010 --> 22:01.000
Um, when I moved out here, I
didn't know a single person,

22:01.050 --> 22:04.840
and I had no money, and I'm
doing just fine, thank you.

22:08.380 --> 22:10.180
Okay.

22:10.260 --> 22:12.880
Okay, Gene, I think I know
what you're trying to do here,

22:12.900 --> 22:14.640
and I'm just, I'm not going
to fall for it, okay?

22:14.680 --> 22:16.460
I just... I know what you,

22:16.490 --> 22:19.260
you want me to say. I get it, okay? I...

22:23.510 --> 22:27.110
Okay, you want me to
say that I was married

22:27.130 --> 22:31.740
and he was abusive and I
stayed in it for years anyway.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.600
Is that what you want?

22:33.640 --> 22:35.680
That's what you wanted to hear.

22:38.590 --> 22:40.770
Wait, you think that I'm
booking all these weak women

22:40.800 --> 22:43.320
because I was weak in my marriage?

22:43.680 --> 22:45.470
Well, you're wrong.

22:45.550 --> 22:48.090
You're wrong, I am not weak.

22:48.180 --> 22:49.520
I left, okay?

22:49.550 --> 22:52.470
I... I moved to LA to live for me,

22:52.550 --> 22:55.090
and now I stand up for myself and...

22:55.180 --> 22:57.180
and I don't apologize

22:57.260 --> 23:00.100
and... and I am with someone

23:00.120 --> 23:03.280
who respects and accepts
me for who I am, okay?

23:03.330 --> 23:07.240
And I will never, ever be
with a violent man again.

23:21.300 --> 23:24.160
Don't you think that that
might be your story?

26:17.820 --> 26:19.550
I, uh...

26:39.180 --> 26:42.140
Shit.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.880
Shit.

27:05.340 --> 27:07.510
Shit! Shit!

27:09.270 --> 27:10.700
Aah! Shit!

27:30.630 --> 27:32.590
Oh, shit.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.640
Shit.

28:16.180 --> 28:17.800
Fuches?

28:17.880 --> 28:19.260
Yeah.

28:19.340 --> 28:21.700
Hey, look, I know, I know
that you don't wanna see me,

28:21.720 --> 28:23.940
and I don't wanna see you. I get it.

28:25.680 --> 28:27.260
What the fuck are you doing here, man?

28:27.340 --> 28:29.340
I don't... I don't want to bother you,

28:29.430 --> 28:31.590
but I'm just a bit
freaked out, you know.

28:31.680 --> 28:34.300
You know what I'm saying? The
LAPD, they came to Cleveland

28:34.380 --> 28:36.350
and they were asking a
bunch of questions.

28:36.380 --> 28:38.240
- How the fuck did you find me?
- Barry, just shut the fuck up

28:38.260 --> 28:39.980
and listen to me.

28:41.430 --> 28:42.980
Did you kill a fucking cop?

28:45.580 --> 28:47.590
That's all. Huh? Did you?

28:47.680 --> 28:49.069
Because they think I'm involved,

28:49.070 --> 28:51.000
and I've got to fucking
know exactly what happened,

28:51.020 --> 28:52.340
- what the fuck you did.
- Yeah, you gotta go. You gotta go.

28:52.370 --> 28:54.010
- Fuches, you gotta go.
- No, I could go to jail.

28:54.030 --> 28:56.280
You don't ambush me like this.
You don't ambush me like this!

28:56.300 --> 28:57.680
- You gotta go!
- I could go to fucking jail!

28:57.700 --> 29:00.400
- It's not about you, it's about me, man!
- I don't care. Fuck off.

29:00.420 --> 29:02.050
Fuck off!

29:03.800 --> 29:05.180
I can fucking help you!

29:05.260 --> 29:07.220
I don't wanna see you again!

29:19.180 --> 29:22.740
I can get him. Just
give me another shot.
