09:14.054 --> 09:16.556
I'm unarmed,
except for the arms I was born with,

09:16.639 --> 09:18.266
and I'm not wearing a wire,

09:18.349 --> 09:21.061
except in my bra,
'cause I need the support.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.021
But that's my business!

09:23.772 --> 09:27.275
Okay! But don't try anything funny!

09:27.358 --> 09:28.443
[door closes]

09:29.861 --> 09:31.529
I wish she hadn't said that.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.990
Now all I want to do is funny stuff...

09:34.074 --> 09:36.159
like go down these stairs.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.414
[Yermuther] Ma'am, that bit doesn't work
without some kind of partition.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.504
What do you want, Kimmy?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.005
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.507
Yeah, what's going on?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.550
The FBI is out there, and they have guns,

09:52.634 --> 09:54.344
and there's a dog with a badge.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.554
Why didn't I pet him? I was right there.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.264
He looked at me.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.808
What's going on? Oh!

09:59.891 --> 10:02.185
I'm just doing what you told me to do.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.312
Okay, I get that
you want to blame me,

10:04.395 --> 10:05.855
but I didn't tell you to do this.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.108
Oh, really?

10:08.191 --> 10:10.693
Then what redheaded snake
offered me this apple?

10:10.777 --> 10:14.239
[goofy voice] "You don't need a man.
You can do a cult all by yourself."

10:14.322 --> 10:15.907
That's your snake voice?

10:15.990 --> 10:18.076
Guess you don't meet a lot of snakes.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.453
"It's 2016. Women can run cults."

10:20.537 --> 10:22.163
Wrong and wrong, Kimmy!

10:22.247 --> 10:25.208
'Cause they can't,
and, also, it's 2017 now.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.752
Well, it was 2016 when I said it.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.004
This doesn't work in reverse.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.881
I did everything the men do.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.800
I got a compound. I wrote my scripture.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.927
I got a bunch of child husbands.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.679
You got child hus-whats?

Gretchen, your lamp broke, on its own.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.109
I saw you, Jasper!

10:51.192 --> 10:53.027
Wait. Where's all the firewood?

10:53.111 --> 10:54.195
We're building a ramp!

10:54.279 --> 10:55.196
[both] Yeah!

10:55.280 --> 10:56.698
[boy] Oh, my God, that's gross!

10:56.781 --> 10:57.824
-So gross!
-[sighs]

10:59.284 --> 11:02.120
I never told you
to kidnap a bunch of boys.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.913
Do you, like, do stuff with them?

11:03.997 --> 11:06.583
Ugh! Why would I want to be
with a bunch of skinny virgins

11:06.666 --> 11:08.376
who lie about showering?

11:08.459 --> 11:10.295
I didn't lie. I-I showered.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.088
-You didn't!
-I can smell you from here.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.383
See? This doesn't work in reverse.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.759
Uh, when's lunch?

11:16.843 --> 11:20.054
I spend 80% of my day making sandwiches,

11:20.138 --> 11:22.181
because lizard god forbid

11:22.265 --> 11:24.058
they learn how to put peanut butter
on bread.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.644
Okay, I remember us
making our own beans.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.062
It's easier if I just do it.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.230
[TV blaring]

11:29.314 --> 11:31.900
Is there something educational
you two want to watch?

11:31.983 --> 11:34.485
[male narrator]
<i>The orca are highly social animals...</i>

11:34.569 --> 11:37.947
And no screens until you finish
your drawings of Jeebus and Gorp.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.532
That should be a fun assignment.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.118
-[groans] Fine!
-Whatever.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.329
[male narrator]
<i>...including clicks, whistles, and...</i>

11:44.412 --> 11:46.205
Gretchen, you don't seem very happy.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.124
Oh, I'm supposed to be happy now, too?

11:48.207 --> 11:51.544
I don't even know what that means anymore.

11:51.628 --> 11:54.589
I'm just saying this isn't working.
You're miserable.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.674
Why don't you just go out there
and surrender?

11:56.758 --> 11:58.635
You mean give up? No.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.511
Cults is the only thing
I've ever cared about,

12:00.595 --> 12:02.305
and I'm not gonna let this be a failure,

12:02.388 --> 12:03.932
'cause I'm gonna do one thing right.

12:04.015 --> 12:07.352
I'm gonna finish it like a man.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.940
Oh, my gosh!

12:12.023 --> 12:13.358
No, Gretchen.

12:13.441 --> 12:14.943
Someone could really get hurt.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.153
Yeah, that's the plan.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.572
I'm the one that called the FBI,

12:19.656 --> 12:21.282
and I'm gonna go down in flames.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.535
Hey, I need $200. It's for a sword.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.371
Death is the eternal sleep, Kimmy,

12:26.454 --> 12:28.122
and Mommy needs a nap.

[ominous music]

12:32.543 --> 12:35.380
[Jacqueline] Oh, Russ's

12:47.892 --> 12:51.521
Boy, someone was worried
about Africa not having any mayonnaise.

13:01.322 --> 13:04.242
[mysterious music]

13:06.703 --> 13:09.497
"Meemaw's secret corn pudding recipe."

13:09.580 --> 13:12.041
What am I supposed to do with this, Russ?

13:12.625 --> 13:15.253
I mean, obviously,
you don't want Duke to have it.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.423
Oh, God, you are so lucky
you don't have to deal with this stuff.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.343
I said I'd do anything
to make your family happy,

13:22.427 --> 13:24.804
and giving them the recipe
could earn us some goodwill

13:24.887 --> 13:26.472
that we can use later on,

13:26.556 --> 13:29.100
but that would mean betraying you.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.688
There's got to be a way
I can have my cake and eat it, too.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.357
But, is that the expression?
I don't really eat cake.

13:36.441 --> 13:39.777
Although I did sit on one once
for Richard Branson.

13:39.861 --> 13:42.113
How can I give them the corn pudding

13:42.196 --> 13:44.615
without giving them the recipe?

13:47.910 --> 13:51.497
Oh, God, I'm going to have to cook.

13:51.581 --> 13:54.334
[male narrator] <i>The bonobo,</i>
<i>genetically our closest relative...</i>

13:54.417 --> 13:57.086
[Kimmy] Oh, my gosh.
Are you serious, Gretchen?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.922
You want them to come in here
and blow you up?

14:00.006 --> 14:02.508
I'm not letting
the first female cult leader--

14:02.592 --> 14:03.426
Do we have any batteries?

14:03.509 --> 14:05.970
Me and Zach found a bees' nest
in the attic we want to throw them at.

14:06.054 --> 14:06.971
In a second!

14:07.055 --> 14:10.391
I'm not letting
the first female cult leader ever--

14:10.475 --> 14:11.517
Hey, where's my sweatshirt?

14:11.601 --> 14:14.270
-Maybe look in the laundry!
-The interrupting needs to stop.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.856
I'm not going down in history as a joke,

14:16.939 --> 14:18.858
like how everybody laughed
at Florence Allen,

14:18.941 --> 14:20.151
the first female judge,

14:20.234 --> 14:21.861
and no one laughed at Trixie Monroe,

14:21.944 --> 14:23.112
the first female clown.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.281
[groans]

14:25.365 --> 14:28.201
This isn't about you
being a woman, Gretchen.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.370
Women can do anything a man can do,

14:30.453 --> 14:32.246
even pee standing up.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.831
Sure, it makes a mess,

14:33.915 --> 14:35.625
but that's the cleaning lady's problem.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.294
And guess what. She's a man.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.712
Oh, really?

14:39.796 --> 14:41.714
If it's not about me being a woman,

14:41.798 --> 14:47.053
then how come this is the only kind
of news coverage I get?

14:47.136 --> 14:50.264
Turns out, I didn't wear it better
than "Sulangee Kuhnowless," Kimmy.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.391
I didn't wear it better at all.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.059
And not a word about my beliefs.

14:53.142 --> 14:56.312
The only place that published anything
from my scripture is <i>The New Yorker,</i>

14:56.396 --> 14:58.106
and that was a misunderstanding.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.650
I wasn't trying to enter
the caption contest.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.568
So what choice do I have now?

15:02.652 --> 15:03.903
I got to blow it all up.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.363
I mean, if I weren't a woman--

15:05.446 --> 15:08.074
Ever think that maybe the problem
isn't that you're a woman?

15:08.157 --> 15:09.826
Maybe the problem
is that you're a Gretchen.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.537
You mean tall, hot,
and ignoring my Lyme disease?

15:12.620 --> 15:13.496
[Kimmy] I mean

15:13.579 --> 15:15.164
this is a mess 'cause you made it a mess.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.416
Oh, of course!

15:16.499 --> 15:18.543
Kimmy thinks she could do it
better than me.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.378
I know I could.

15:20.461 --> 15:23.381
Then go in there and get them
to stop masturbating so much.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.134
I don't want to do that.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.510
You think you're so tough,

15:27.593 --> 15:29.679
but I'm the one with the balls
to kapowee this place.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.723
I'm gonna go out in a blaze of glory
like all the greats--

15:32.807 --> 15:34.892

15:34.976 --> 15:36.853

-What happened to the knot?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.729
Get a safety pin and deal with it, Jasper!

15:38.813 --> 15:40.148
[Gretchen] That's it!

15:40.231 --> 15:41.816

that Kimmy just walks off and leaves me

16:05.590 --> 16:07.133

16:07.216 --> 16:09.051
Oh, Lord.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.053

more and more like jelly,

16:11.137 --> 16:12.430

16:12.513 --> 16:16.225
I'm being punished
for what I did on that cruise.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.644
I ate-- uh, nobody.

16:18.728 --> 16:19.979
What? [chuckles]

16:20.062 --> 16:21.397
Ugh, it's the scurvy talking.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.732

I wish that fancy grocery store
would open already.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.820
You shut your mouth!

And not just to keep your teeth
from falling out!

16:33.034 --> 16:36.537

right here in our neighborhood...

16:36.621 --> 16:38.831

the Irish ate grass.

16:42.835 --> 16:46.255

don't make me be Irish.

19:31.837 --> 19:32.963
Whew.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.840
I think she's just crying
because of the tear gas.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.884
Oh, you want to explain to her
why she's crying?

19:36.967 --> 19:38.469
[scoffs] Good luck with that.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.055
Gretchen, honey,

19:41.138 --> 19:42.473
we're sorry.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.059
We'll never do...

19:45.142 --> 19:49.355
uh, what we did wrong ever again.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.774
Have you lost weight? Everyone thinks so.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.901
Send in a saucy gay friend
for her to get real with.

19:53.984 --> 19:54.819
Go, go, go.

19:56.821 --> 19:59.448
Let it out, girl!

20:01.701 --> 20:03.411
What? No!

20:03.494 --> 20:05.287
Gretchen is dangerous.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.872
She's got kids in there.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.458
You can't treat her different
just 'cause she's...

20:11.127 --> 20:12.294
a woman.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.005
Oh.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.507
I'm going back in.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.592
[sighs]

20:20.010 --> 20:23.973
I'm getting too old
for my bed full of stuffed animals.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.354
Ew.

20:30.438 --> 20:33.232
The inside's all wet.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.859
Look at these people.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.153
They think their pits don't stink

20:37.236 --> 20:39.989
just 'cause their beef
was raised on a farm

20:40.072 --> 20:41.741
instead of being raccoon.

20:41.824 --> 20:43.492
Lillian Kaushtupper.

20:45.536 --> 20:49.707
[British accent]
No. I am Dr. Vanessa Poseidon.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.460
I know it's you, Lillian.
I recognize your perfume.

20:52.543 --> 20:54.712
Aha! I don't wear perfume.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.672
That smell just happens.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.341
Titus. Charmed, you're sure.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.760
Artie Goodman. We met on the phone.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.262
And what are you even doing here,
Goodman?

21:03.345 --> 21:06.140
You got, like, 200 of these dumps.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.851
And an Etsy shop,
where I put googly eyes on trash.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.187
But I visit my stores all the time.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.481
I'm very hands-on.

21:13.564 --> 21:14.857
Gene, how's the girlfriend?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.109
Just don't let the wife find out
about her, am I right?

21:17.193 --> 21:18.944
[Artie chuckles]

21:19.028 --> 21:20.362
He's a terrible person.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.781
So what brings you two here,

21:21.864 --> 21:23.699
besides the obvious shoplifting?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.618
That's profiling.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.037
Just 'cause my clothes aren't as nice

21:28.120 --> 21:31.165
as some of these other people
doesn't mean I'm a thief.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.211
That does.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.006
Titus, are you okay?

21:39.089 --> 21:41.342
No. I got scurvy.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.718
And my Kimmy left,

21:42.802 --> 21:45.429
and we used to get Channel 6,
but now we don't.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.681
Scurvy? Like a British seaman?

21:47.765 --> 21:49.016
Like a British seaman.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.309
Artie, I'm so tired.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.144
[Lillian] Titus needed fresh fruit,

21:52.228 --> 21:54.897
and we couldn't find any
in our neighborhood, okay?

21:54.980 --> 21:55.981
So you happy?

21:56.065 --> 21:58.567
No, that's why
I want to open a store there.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.487
East Dogmouth is what's known
as a food desert.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.073
No access to fruits or vegetables

22:04.156 --> 22:05.741
or eggs that come from birds.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.661
Meanwhile, this neighborhood
is knee-deep in poosi...

22:08.744 --> 22:11.789
a Thai fruit with five times the nutrients
of a banana.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.166
Yeah, the rich get richer,

22:14.250 --> 22:15.584
but in East Dogmouth,

22:15.668 --> 22:18.045
we can't get decent medical care,

22:18.128 --> 22:20.965
and our public transportation stinks,

22:21.048 --> 22:24.510
and our T-shirts have
all the wrong Super Bowl winners.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.887
[Artie] So you agree,

22:26.971 --> 22:28.472
your neighborhood deserves better,

22:28.556 --> 22:31.684
which is why you should want
one of my stores.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.978
What? No.

22:34.061 --> 22:37.356
Which is why <i>you </i> should want
one of <i>my </i> stores.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.775
[exhales sharply] Run, Lillian!

22:39.858 --> 22:41.527
[straining]

22:44.238 --> 22:46.198
I need to bathroom.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.624
[gentle piano music]

22:55.708 --> 22:57.334
[Orson] There's little Flash.

22:57.418 --> 22:59.503
[Duke] And there's Mara!

22:59.587 --> 23:01.338
I wonder what shiny thing
she's off to snatch there.

23:01.422 --> 23:02.506
[laughs]

23:02.590 --> 23:04.174
Did someone order a hot dish?

23:04.258 --> 23:06.969
Well, she's here,
and she brought corn pudding.

23:07.052 --> 23:10.139
Jacqueline, I don't know
what looks more delicious,

23:10.222 --> 23:14.727
-you or that pan of hot corn.
-[chuckles]

23:14.810 --> 23:17.396
You're my favorite daughter-in-law now.

23:17.479 --> 23:20.065
You're gonna have to get braces again.

23:20.149 --> 23:23.485
Oh, Meemaw and Russ.

23:24.612 --> 23:27.114
So that <i>is </i> what she looks like.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.617
All right, let's eat.

23:33.495 --> 23:34.622
[Jacqueline giggles]

23:34.705 --> 23:36.290
[Duke] So you found it.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.584
The recipe.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.252
And it came out great, right?

23:40.336 --> 23:42.171
I'll make it for you anytime you want.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.215
No, the only Korn I like
is the band that played at my wedding.

23:45.299 --> 23:46.759
I just want the recipe.

23:47.676 --> 23:48.677
Why?

23:48.761 --> 23:51.555
Because... tradition.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.432
And proper penmanship is a lost art,

23:53.515 --> 23:54.558
like drunk driving.

23:54.642 --> 23:55.684
I just want it, okay?

23:55.768 --> 23:57.311
I want it because Russ has it.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.188
How could Meemaw give it to him
instead of me?

23:59.271 --> 24:01.482
How could anyone give anything to him
instead of me?

24:01.565 --> 24:03.108
He's a loser, Jacqueline.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.486
I mean, I'm sorry,
but has he ever beaten you at sex?

24:05.569 --> 24:07.321
Hmm? I win every time.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.781
I'm the fastest.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.533
But if Meemaw loved Russ more than me,

24:11.617 --> 24:14.328
what does that make me, hmm?

24:14.411 --> 24:16.288
Worse than Russ?

24:17.790 --> 24:20.459
So, like... two Russes?

24:20.542 --> 24:23.420
I'm sorry, Duke,
but I can't give you the recipe,

24:23.504 --> 24:25.172
even if it means you hate me,

24:25.255 --> 24:26.548
even if the whole family

24:26.632 --> 24:29.718
turns its back on me
so I'm just looking at butts.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.804
I won't betray Russ.

24:33.931 --> 24:36.684
You actually love my brother?

24:36.767 --> 24:38.727
You're not just a gold digger?

24:38.811 --> 24:41.188
[chuckles]

24:42.398 --> 24:43.565
[sighs]

24:43.649 --> 24:46.694
That means Russ has two things I don't...

24:46.777 --> 24:50.406
the recipe and a real marriage
with someone who loves him.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.452
I don't even know what that's like.

24:57.871 --> 25:00.249
Hey.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.585
I'm sure your wife is with you
for more than just your money.

25:03.669 --> 25:07.214
I mean, you've got... boats.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.884
And you know a lot about watches.

25:16.390 --> 25:20.185
[Gretchen] It's like I'm talking,
but she's not listening.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.479
Gretchen, we have to talk.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.648
This must be Kimmy.

25:29.570 --> 25:31.363
Look, you were right.

25:31.447 --> 25:32.948
That cats are just baby dogs?

25:33.031 --> 25:35.242
That this didn't work out
because you're a woman,

25:35.325 --> 25:37.661
because the world
won't let you do it like a man.

25:37.745 --> 25:40.581
See, it's not your fault
that boys don't learn how to cook

25:40.664 --> 25:43.125
or that people are obsessed
with how women look.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.086
I mean, have you seen what they did
to Strawberry Shortcake?

25:46.170 --> 25:48.130
More like Slutberry Slutskank.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.508
And it's not your fault
the FBI won't come in here

25:51.592 --> 25:52.885
because they saw you crying.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.094
Because of the tear gas.

25:54.178 --> 25:55.846
That's what I said!

25:56.180 --> 25:58.682
See, this was never gonna go
how you wanted it to.

26:01.727 --> 26:03.812
Well, I'm not giving up.

26:05.189 --> 26:06.523
I've still got a bomb.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.734
But getting 'sploded is giving up.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.904
It was invented by men
to avoid dealing with stuff.

26:11.987 --> 26:15.115
Not giving up is the elephant matriarch,

26:15.199 --> 26:18.827
leading her herd of bulls and calves
miles across the baking Serengeti.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.205
Not giving up is the female orca,

26:21.288 --> 26:24.291
whose matrilineal society
relies on older females

26:24.374 --> 26:27.294
to guide the pod
to their traditional feeding grounds.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.588
[British accent] Or consider the bonobo,

26:29.671 --> 26:31.590
genetically our closest cousin.

26:31.673 --> 26:35.093
A troop of bonobos
is led by a veritable gynocracy.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.262
The alpha female surrounds herself

26:37.346 --> 26:38.889
with a pack of loyal sisters

26:38.972 --> 26:43.393
for hunting, defense,
and invariably pleasure.

26:43.477 --> 26:45.312
How do you know all that?

26:46.355 --> 26:48.106
I don't know.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.650
[male narrator]
<i>...that in the wilds of every continent,</i>

26:49.733 --> 26:51.485
<i>females are strong as hell.</i>

26:51.568 --> 26:53.445
<i>I'm Fitzgibbons Munrunney.</i>

26:54.613 --> 26:57.616
But my point is,
you can't run a cult like a man.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.786
You have to run it like a female bonobo

27:00.869 --> 27:03.080
or orca or elephant.

27:03.163 --> 27:06.250
Gretchen, you have to be a "bonorcaphant."

27:06.333 --> 27:08.669
Kimmy, that's the only thing
you've ever said

27:08.752 --> 27:09.962
that makes any sense.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.463
So don't give up.

27:11.547 --> 27:14.633
Get out there and face the consequences.

27:15.926 --> 27:17.511
Like a woman.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.513
My next cult is gonna be all women.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.390
It's gonna be so quiet.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.475
[exhales sharply]

27:23.559 --> 27:24.560
[door opens]

27:26.562 --> 27:27.563
[door opens]

27:28.147 --> 27:29.731
Hey, is Gretchen out there?

27:30.315 --> 27:32.776
We, uh, Krazy-Glued our wieners together.

27:32.860 --> 27:35.028
[indistinct chatter, chuckling]

27:40.367 --> 27:42.160
[Artie] Nice to see you again, Kimmy.

27:42.244 --> 27:45.539
Titus has been sitting here
for quite some time.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.332
I'm sorry. Something came up.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.543
He was pretty sick.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.712
-[coughs]
-And scared.

27:56.383 --> 27:57.801
You know what?

27:57.885 --> 28:00.846
A male Kimmy wouldn't be treated this way.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.389
You'd all be like,

28:02.472 --> 28:04.641
"Ooh, look at what
a great male Kimmy that is,

28:04.725 --> 28:06.560
picking up his Titus."

28:07.686 --> 28:09.688
Let's go home, buddy.

28:12.983 --> 28:15.527
[whispering] I stole wine.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.202
No, see, that's what I'm saying.

28:24.286 --> 28:25.829
There wouldn't be any pimps.

28:25.913 --> 28:28.665
The "bonorcaphant" protects us from men.

28:28.749 --> 28:30.167
[Black Cindy] Oh...

28:30.250 --> 28:31.752
Now, I like the orca part,

28:31.835 --> 28:33.921
'cause once,
I stabbed my boss at SeaWorld.

28:34.004 --> 28:36.048
Thank you for sharing that, Black Cindy.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.299
Yeah.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.800
Hi, I'm Gretchen.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.802
Nice Bieber cut.

28:40.886 --> 28:43.096
Elaine, you've been quiet.

28:45.682 --> 28:49.228
[in American Sign Language]
The Yakuza cut out my tongue.

28:49.311 --> 28:50.646
[Black Cindy groans]

28:50.729 --> 28:54.149
I am loving this.

30:14.438 --> 30:16.356
