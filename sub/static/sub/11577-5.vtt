[BO narrating]
Last time on Lost Girl:

00:07.216 --> 00:08.046
[TRICK] Three dead humans.

00:08.259 --> 00:10.124
I want you and
Vex to look into it.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.720
We're dealing with a cult here.

00:11.929 --> 00:12.793
[DYSON] A Fae cult.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.675
[LAUREN] Dyson, those three
bodies from the elevator crash,

00:14.891 --> 00:16.006
they were taken
the other night.

00:16.225 --> 00:17.726
Now, you wanna tell us
what you're running from?

00:17.935 --> 00:19.345
He's here.

00:21.147 --> 00:23.479
[BO] What is it about you?

00:23.691 --> 00:25.522
Why are you hunting me?

00:25.735 --> 00:26.645
Because you're a shifter.

00:26.861 --> 00:27.771
Who the hell are you?

00:27.987 --> 00:29.648
[DYSON] A shifter like you.

00:31.574 --> 00:33.030
I'm trouble; everyone says so.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.322
[DYSON] I'm never
gonna see it that way.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.275
Because I'm your father.

00:49.634 --> 00:51.044
[beep]

00:56.724 --> 00:59.431
And that's when I
decided to up and leave.

00:59.644 --> 01:01.384
Reclaim who I used to be.

01:01.604 --> 01:02.764
[cell phone buzzes]

01:02.980 --> 01:06.143
Oh, thank god.
Uh--but uh, keep talking.

01:06.359 --> 01:08.896
Super interested
in your journey.

01:10.238 --> 01:10.852
Hello?

01:11.072 --> 01:12.812
Your insight; I need it.

01:13.032 --> 01:15.444
Birthday gift
from Hell. Literally.

01:15.660 --> 01:17.366
And you want me to
tell you what it means.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.159
It's all I'm good for, right?

01:19.372 --> 01:21.237
Look, I'm on a...

01:23.251 --> 01:25.742
...date. So whatever's going
on with you tomorrow,

01:25.962 --> 01:27.953
lukewarm pints at
The Dal, your treat.

01:28.172 --> 01:30.413
Fine. Tomorrow.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.932
Here's hoping there is one.

01:43.479 --> 01:44.980
You said you're new to town?

01:45.189 --> 01:50.479
Oh, I'm... boring. But you,
you're fascinating.

01:50.695 --> 01:52.026
Please, continue.

01:52.238 --> 01:53.603
Siblings?

01:53.823 --> 01:56.360
l have a douchebag cousin
named Seymour. That count?

01:56.575 --> 02:00.488
Mmm, yeah, well, l have
a sister who's a party girl;

02:00.705 --> 02:02.570
only wants to have a good time.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.576
Personality out the wazoo.

02:04.792 --> 02:08.000
Sounds fun. And she's single?

02:08.212 --> 02:11.704
Hardly. But she was
thrilled when I told her

02:11.924 --> 02:13.789
you're an oracle.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.047
So she's looking for a reading.

02:17.263 --> 02:19.504
And let me guess, you too.

02:19.724 --> 02:20.884
[clears throat]

02:21.100 --> 02:23.933
Fine. Let's just do it
and get it over with.

02:24.145 --> 02:28.559
Actually, |--|'d like to order.
Are you ready?

02:29.650 --> 02:32.357
You seriously don't
want a reading?

02:32.570 --> 02:34.902
It's all anyone ever wants.

02:35.114 --> 02:36.650
You're offended.

02:36.866 --> 02:40.233
Surprised.
Oracle doesn't exactly

02:40.453 --> 02:43.741
spell lucky in love, y'know.

02:43.956 --> 02:46.789
Well your luck
is about to change.

02:47.001 --> 02:53.418
'Cause I believe that life
is about anticipation.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.497
That's the fun part.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.130
Yeah.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.429
[CASSIE]
Condo overlooking the city.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.767
Breakfast bar in the kitchen.

03:03.976 --> 03:06.012
How 'bout you?
What's your five year?

03:06.228 --> 03:10.642
Same thing, only there's
a dog in mine; Gatsby.

03:10.858 --> 03:15.227
And he hates walks and he opens
wine bottles with his teeth.

03:17.490 --> 03:23.736
Y'know, if you could see
the future, you see this?

03:33.506 --> 03:35.167
[chuckles]

03:35.383 --> 03:40.423
Um, wow you're uh...
you're a really good kisser.

03:40.638 --> 03:44.301
And a gentleman.

03:44.517 --> 03:46.098
Call me tomorrow.

03:57.613 --> 04:00.355
Please God,
let the peen check out.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.324
[laughs]

04:01.534 --> 04:04.071
Ngh! What the--?

04:08.374 --> 04:11.992
Ugh.

04:12.211 --> 04:15.999
What the shit is happening?!

04:18.384 --> 04:22.969
[CASSIE groaning]

04:23.180 --> 04:29.551
[screaming]

04:31.439 --> 04:36.433
[opening theme]

04:38.028 --> 04:39.279
[TAMSIN] So what's up with
you playing Daddy Dolittle

04:39.488 --> 04:40.648
to Dyson's mini me?

04:40.865 --> 04:41.980
[TRICK]
Oh, he's working here.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.736
Mark's new to our colony.
Exposure to Fae kind

04:44.952 --> 04:46.488
will do him some good.

04:46.704 --> 04:49.662
Yeah, it's not the first
person he's exposed himself to.

04:49.874 --> 04:50.704
Huh?

04:50.916 --> 04:52.076
Uh, nothing.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.658
Hey, have either of
you guys seen Cassie?

04:53.878 --> 04:54.958
She was supposed
to meet me here.

04:55.171 --> 04:56.160
--[TAMS|N] Nope.
--[TRICK] Not yet.

04:56.380 --> 04:59.042
But, here.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.008
I got you something.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.003
Aw, Trick.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.674
Wow, heh.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.300
[BO] Thank you.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.507
Oh.

05:10.728 --> 05:12.810
Belonged to Alexander the Fae.

05:13.022 --> 05:15.809
[TRICK] Handed down through
our family for generations.

05:16.025 --> 05:17.856
Happy birthday, Bo.

05:19.904 --> 05:21.189
You totally gave me the finger.

05:21.405 --> 05:22.190
[ALL laugh]

05:22.406 --> 05:25.489
That was--
birthday finger. Right.

05:25.701 --> 05:29.865
Mmm. Um, I... have stuff to do.

05:34.418 --> 05:35.874
I can't believe that
we forgot Bo's birthday.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.246
We're the worst
people in the world.

05:37.463 --> 05:40.000
Well, I understand howl
forgot because hello, it's me.

05:40.216 --> 05:41.376
But how did you forget?

05:41.592 --> 05:42.627
l have had
a lot on the go.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.253
|-| have been very busy
with things like, like--

05:44.470 --> 05:45.425
Sucking up to Evony.

05:45.638 --> 05:46.798
I like to call it working.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.094
Working, shmirking.

05:48.307 --> 05:49.888
Either way, we need
to make it up to Bo.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.556
I'm thinking a surprise
party at The Dal.

05:51.769 --> 05:54.636
[gasps] Yeti strippers.
And drinking 'til we vom.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.231
Always with the class.
Actually--no, that's good.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.395
You keep her
outta the club house.

05:57.608 --> 05:58.643
|t'|| give me a
chance to back a cake,

05:58.859 --> 06:00.190
get some balloons,
that kinda thing.

06:00.402 --> 06:01.562
And find the perfect present.

06:01.779 --> 06:02.939
[gaSPS]

06:03.155 --> 06:04.565
Oh...

06:04.782 --> 06:07.148
[TAMSIN] You've been replaced.
I found Bo's new--

06:07.368 --> 06:08.778
[LAUREN] No.

06:09.495 --> 06:12.111
What? I was gonna say companion.

06:12.331 --> 06:15.243
You can't be serious.
That thing is awful.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.040
What about that?
Bo loves knickknacks.

06:17.253 --> 06:19.289
[TAMSIN]
No one loves knickknacks.

06:19.505 --> 06:22.087
'Cause they don't
bring ya luck, that's why.

06:22.967 --> 06:25.549
That kitty's from the
Emperor Kang dynasty.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.797
[MAN] The legend says
Kang was a poor warrior

06:28.013 --> 06:30.004
until he came upon
that magic kitty.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.088
Magic kitty?

06:31.308 --> 06:34.800
Yeah. That cat brings luck to
its owner and people around it.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.976
Word. How much?

06:37.189 --> 06:39.054
Oh, I don't know
if I can sell it.

06:39.275 --> 06:40.105
Oh...

06:40.317 --> 06:41.773
That brings us back
to the kickknack.

06:41.986 --> 06:43.396
But seventy-five
oughta cover it.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.773
I'll take it. Give me
seventy-five bucks.

06:50.953 --> 06:51.863
[CASSIE] I've got
something better to do

06:52.079 --> 06:53.159
than talk to you right now.

06:53.372 --> 06:56.205
Leave a message and
I'll call you. Maybe.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.749
Cassie, it's Bo.
If you're there, pick up.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.292
Or call me.

07:00.504 --> 07:03.211
Or smoke signals or something.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.129
[exhales heavily]

07:04.341 --> 07:06.332
Cassie's not returning any
of my texts or phone calls.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.463
Maybe she's sick.

07:08.679 --> 07:11.716
It's not like you to worry.
Somethin' goin' on?

07:11.932 --> 07:12.967
--[BO] With me?
--[TR|CK] Mhmmm.

07:13.183 --> 07:16.971
No, no. I'm just concerned
about Cassie and...

07:17.187 --> 07:18.893
Which is why I'm
going over there.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.721
[TRICK] Okay.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.107
Happy birthday!

07:26.113 --> 07:28.024
Wow. Ah-hah.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.276
Wow, you guys
shouldn't have. Really.

07:30.492 --> 07:33.074
I didn't. This
is from me. It's a--

07:33.287 --> 07:34.823
[TAMSIN] Don't say...

07:35.039 --> 07:36.700
knickknack.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.292
[LAUREN] Well, that
was only part of my gift.

07:39.501 --> 07:44.336
[LAUREN] The...
cat is also from me.

07:44.548 --> 07:49.258
Oh. Now suddenly the
cat's good enough for you.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.630
Anyway, the man said
it would bring you

07:50.846 --> 07:52.211
[TAMSIN] lots of
happiness and good luck.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.717
But it's foolish to think
that an external object

07:54.933 --> 07:56.139
[LAUREN] can dictate
the likelihood of

07:56.352 --> 07:57.808
fortunate events,
so... [chuckles]

07:58.020 --> 07:59.430
Who hurt you?

07:59.647 --> 08:03.390
[BO] Well, I love it. It's,
ah, very roadkill-chic.

08:03.609 --> 08:05.440
[chuckles]

08:05.653 --> 08:06.813
Are you going somewhere?

08:07.029 --> 08:07.984
Hm?

08:08.197 --> 08:10.779
Oh, Cassie's. Yeah,
I just have this bad feeling

08:10.991 --> 08:12.151
but |'m--|'m sure
everything's fine.

08:12.368 --> 08:13.198
I can come with you.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.365
Yeah. Me too.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.864
[TAMSIN] Um...
Did you forget that thing,

08:17.081 --> 08:19.072
you know,
that we talked about?

08:19.291 --> 08:21.373
I'm not looking
at your mole again.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.117
Oh, yes. That thing.

08:24.338 --> 08:27.626
|--| have to stay and--
and do that thing.

08:27.841 --> 08:28.341
Yes indeed.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.960
Yeah.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.709
Okay.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.340
Okay.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.966
Okay.

08:37.393 --> 08:43.013
Well, |'m--|'m on my cell
if anybody needs me.

08:43.232 --> 08:47.100
[LAUREN] Which,
apparently, you don't.

08:48.487 --> 08:49.818
[knocking]

08:50.030 --> 08:52.066
Cassie?

08:52.282 --> 08:53.658
[knocking]

08:53.867 --> 08:55.403
Cassie, it's Bo. Open up.

08:55.619 --> 08:56.574
Just let me kick
the door down.

08:56.787 --> 08:58.527
Okay, why don't
we try the knob first.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.203
[door knob turns]

09:00.416 --> 09:03.249
lt's unlocked.
That's fortunate.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.496
Lucky cat. Boom!

09:10.551 --> 09:11.961
Cassie?

09:13.095 --> 09:15.006
We need to contain the scene.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.463
There's more.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.981
We need to get blood
samples to Lauren.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.028
I'm gonna call D.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.983
[TAMSIN] Tell him
we've got a crime scene.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.693
Yeah.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.950
Because if it isn't...

09:43.167 --> 09:46.125
this was the worst
dinner party in history.

09:49.214 --> 09:56.336
[alternative rock music plays]

09:56.555 --> 09:58.921
Good evening St. Louis. Ahhhh!

09:59.141 --> 10:00.927
For one night only,
the greatest drummer since

10:01.143 --> 10:03.634
John Bonham and
Keith Moon combined.

10:03.854 --> 10:06.015
Minds will be blown--
other things if you're lucky.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.607
[rim shot]

10:07.816 --> 10:09.226
Put your hands together for...

10:12.780 --> 10:14.771
Mark!

10:14.990 --> 10:16.446
Huh? Wha--What?

10:16.658 --> 10:18.865
Hey, uh, sorry, I was just, um.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.783
They looked dirty
so I was cleanin' 'em.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.532
You still need to sign in.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.245
Sign what?

10:28.462 --> 10:29.952
[TRICK] Right there.

10:30.172 --> 10:32.208
This ledger contains all
the names of the Fae

10:32.424 --> 10:34.380
who've passed
through our colony.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.428
And more than our names,

10:39.640 --> 10:44.509
our signatures
contain our true power.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.593
Wow.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.770
Cool.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.392
Ah. Uh, whoops.

10:50.609 --> 10:54.272
And this is why
I keep it in my lair.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.979
[TRICK] Thank you.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.321
[BC]
I thought I lost this.

11:05.541 --> 11:06.997
I gotta go.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.833
Okay. Dyson's
at the crime scene.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.456
He's got Lauren
running the blood.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.504
I called Pythia and Dedona,
the other oracles.

11:14.716 --> 11:15.842
I'm still waiting
to hear back.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.416
Bo, this is scary.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.922
An oracle's abilities in the
wrong hands could be deadly.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.298
What about Cassie's family?

11:21.515 --> 11:23.380
[TAMSIN] I called her cousin.
He's coming in for questioning.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.465
Wait. Seymour?

11:26.520 --> 11:28.101
[SEYMOUR]
You remember, succubabe.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.269
I'm touched.

11:30.482 --> 11:33.019
Color me Archie.
It's Betty and Veronica.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.271
Nice to see you too, Jughead.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.102
Your uncle know you're
out of jail already?

11:37.322 --> 11:39.984
Una Mens cut his throat.
His punishment.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.986
Stole luck from the wrong Fae.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.191
What's this about Cassie?

11:43.412 --> 11:44.902
She's been missing
for twelve hours.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.111
[TAMSIN] Something bad
has happened to her.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.322
Yeah, well Cassie's special.
People don't like that.

11:48.542 --> 11:49.452
People like you?

11:49.668 --> 11:50.828
[SEYMOUR] I'm a soul eater.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.831
I suck people's spirits.
Not exactly beloved.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.038
Sucking things
made me popular.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.337
Took over Mayer's
rack and it's failing.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.794
What's a bookie without
the ability to steal luck?

12:02.014 --> 12:03.129
[SEYMOUR]
Instead of helping out,

12:03.348 --> 12:05.134
Cassie emancipated
herself from the clan.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.261
Well, maybe she felt like
you were trying to use her.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.853
I can relate.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.677
Family problems, eh?

12:10.898 --> 12:13.480
Look, if you want answers,
talk to her computer dates.

12:13.692 --> 12:14.556
Computer dates?

12:14.776 --> 12:15.640
Oh, robots.

12:15.861 --> 12:18.694
Guys she met online. Fae Date?

12:18.906 --> 12:20.897
[SEYMOUR] She probably
ran into some weirdo.

12:21.116 --> 12:24.153
If you don't mind,
I have a business to save.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.075
What do you think?

12:37.382 --> 12:40.465
I think it's time we start
pricing dating memberships.

12:41.261 --> 12:45.049
Dyson, it's me. All the
blood is the same type.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.927
Any word from Bo?

12:48.143 --> 12:52.682
Okay, well, keep me posted.
I'm... here at the club house.

12:54.358 --> 12:58.192
Bakin' a cake. You know,
the important stuff.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.908
Salt. Not sugar. That's salt.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.830
[knocking at door]

13:13.502 --> 13:15.413
[LAUREN] Oh no,
no, no, no, no, no.

13:15.629 --> 13:16.414
[groans]

13:16.630 --> 13:19.463
No, I asked for these to
be delivered to The Dal Riata.

13:19.675 --> 13:21.290
Well, if you want me
to take these to The Dal

13:21.510 --> 13:23.091
it's gonna cost you extra.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.841
You know what, just leave
them with me; I'll take them.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.715
Is something burning?

13:29.935 --> 13:31.391
What?

13:31.603 --> 13:32.228
[gaSPSI

13:32.437 --> 13:35.224
[LAUREN] No. Bo's cake. No!

13:43.448 --> 13:45.530
[LAUREN] Well... they said
it would bring luck;

13:45.742 --> 13:47.698
I guess they
didn't say what kind.

13:48.578 --> 13:58.579
[folk music plays]

13:58.797 --> 14:00.537
Hey! Hey you!

14:00.757 --> 14:02.213
You think I don't know a
dine and dash when I see one?

14:02.426 --> 14:03.962
[chuckles]

14:04.177 --> 14:08.671
Yeah, well, Trick's a mate of mine.
And it means I don't pay.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.142
I'll let it slide this once.

14:11.351 --> 14:17.312
Ah, dude, you uh, you
drink and then you pay.

14:17.524 --> 14:21.358
All right.
Have it your way then.

14:22.029 --> 14:26.318
Hey, everybody! Drunken
beady eyes on me.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.275
Now who has a
weak drink courtesy of

14:29.494 --> 14:31.530
Abercrombie here, huh?

14:31.747 --> 14:32.327
[GROUP] Yeah.

14:32.539 --> 14:32.777
--[VEX] Yeah.
--[WOMAN] Yeah.

14:32.998 --> 14:33.578
What are you doing?

14:33.790 --> 14:34.540
[MAN] Right here, brother.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.615
I saw you under
pour three customers.

14:36.835 --> 14:39.918
Plannin' on liftin'
a snifter later, are we?

14:41.006 --> 14:43.588
Fine. Hey, everyone!

14:43.800 --> 14:46.542
Your next drink, it's on me.

14:49.681 --> 14:50.306
You happy now?

14:50.515 --> 14:53.131
Yeah. Not as happy
as I'm gonna be.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.763
[VEX] Courtesy those
divine birds givin' us

14:55.979 --> 14:57.935
the hobbly-bob right now.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.934
Uh, "us"?

15:03.987 --> 15:08.947
Rock, paper, guillotine.
Loser distracts the boyfriend.

15:12.329 --> 15:13.739
[VEX grunts]

15:13.955 --> 15:15.991
Bollocks.

15:28.178 --> 15:31.045
Maybe we
should, uh... go...

15:31.264 --> 15:32.094
[MARK] someplace else.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.548
No. Here is perfect.

15:34.768 --> 15:38.306
It's so... booky.

15:38.522 --> 15:42.481
Whatever you're on,
dollface, I want some.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.450
[MARK] We should...
probably get...

15:54.663 --> 15:56.528
[zipper unzips]
[MARK] Oh...

15:58.208 --> 15:59.072
[BLONDE GIRL moans]

15:59.292 --> 16:01.248
[MARK] Auh, that--that's good.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.871
That's good.

16:03.088 --> 16:04.419
[moans] That's good.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.087
Oh, that's good.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.129
--[BLONDE GIRL moans]
--[MARK] | likey.

16:07.342 --> 16:08.878
I likey a lot.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.338
That's why I heart
shifters so much.

16:14.558 --> 16:19.018
Your bodies are
always so... ripply.

16:19.229 --> 16:21.390
Thanks.

16:21.606 --> 16:26.600
[MARK] You too. You, um,
work out or something?

16:29.406 --> 16:31.237
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.697
Oh, thank you paper.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.415
Ha... hi?

16:46.631 --> 16:48.542
Hi.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.669
I wanna look at you.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.460
Okay.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.547
[camera shutter]

16:57.767 --> 16:58.426
[BO] Can you hurry up?

16:58.643 --> 17:00.019
They're profile pictures,
not art.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.729
[TAMSIN] Uh,
not with that attitude.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.724
Would it kill you
to arch your back?

17:03.940 --> 17:05.055
[h uffs]

17:05.275 --> 17:07.857
[TAMSIN] Oh yeah. Okay.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.810
[TAMSIN] Ooh,
show papa whatcha got.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.692
How's this?

17:12.908 --> 17:17.322
[purring]

17:17.537 --> 17:19.277
You're purring.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.328
[purring continues]

17:21.541 --> 17:23.156
I guess I was seized
by the moment.

17:24.336 --> 17:25.872
Okay.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.507
Ooh!

17:33.720 --> 17:36.052
Check out SelkieStud69

17:36.264 --> 17:38.471
[TAMSIN] and his
all too small tank top.

17:38.683 --> 17:39.513
Imma need a moment.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.513
Um, you already had thirty
moments with Brad Pitt's troll.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.094
We need to finish my profile.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.225
| just wanna wink at him.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.231
[TAMSIN] There.

17:49.444 --> 17:50.854
Okay.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.403
The last person who messaged
Cassie was Herati055.

17:53.615 --> 17:54.400
That was last night.

17:54.616 --> 17:55.947
Do you really think he'll
buy me as an oracle?

17:56.159 --> 17:58.946
I think with a face like yours,
he'll buy anything we say.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.126
There.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.876
Because you are...

18:12.092 --> 18:13.832
[TAMSIN] Anika.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.758
Oracle of his dreams.

18:15.971 --> 18:18.587
Herati055 won't even
know what hit him.

18:20.934 --> 18:21.684
What?

18:21.893 --> 18:22.882
Pythia's mother
said she'd call me

18:23.103 --> 18:24.434
when she made contact
with her daughter.

18:24.646 --> 18:25.806
Still nothing.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.182
Do you think another
oracle's missing?

18:27.399 --> 18:29.515
I think I need to get out there.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.521
Okay. Next profile question,

18:32.737 --> 18:34.318
"what is your greatest
aspiration in life?"

18:34.531 --> 18:35.441
[TAMSIN] We should
probably try and match it

18:35.657 --> 18:36.646
to whatever Cassie said.

18:36.866 --> 18:37.730
[typing]

18:37.951 --> 18:39.361
[computer dings]

18:43.123 --> 18:44.533
What did she write?

18:44.749 --> 18:47.286
To find people she could trust.

18:47.502 --> 18:50.835
It's not easy finding people
you can trust in this life.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.207
Guess she didn't
emancipate herself

18:52.424 --> 18:54.460
because she didn't want family.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.304
[computer dings]

18:58.513 --> 19:01.220
That was fast.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.513
[TAMSIN] That was lucky.

19:02.726 --> 19:04.512
[cell phone rings]

19:04.728 --> 19:06.218
You're not kidding. It's Cassie.

19:06.438 --> 19:09.054
[BO] Hello? Cassie?

19:09.274 --> 19:10.605
Cassie?

19:10.817 --> 19:12.853
Cassie, can you hear me?

19:14.821 --> 19:16.061
I think her phone died.

19:16.281 --> 19:17.316
[TAMSIN] What did
she say? Is she okay?

19:17.532 --> 19:18.612
No.

19:18.825 --> 19:26.038
:2

19:26.249 --> 19:28.035
[BO through phone]
Cassie, where are you?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.080

[indie rock music plays]

19:37.135 --> 19:45.975
[indie rock music plays]

19:46.186 --> 19:50.145
I'm pretty sure that's something
those girls will not soon forget.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.348
[MAN] Where is he?

19:52.567 --> 19:53.977
I'm pretty sure that's
something the boyfriend

19:54.194 --> 19:55.434
won't forget, either.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.860
Ah, you know what,
paper never wins.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.485
Whoa, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey. Calm down, fella.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.816
[VEX] No one knows
what really went on.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.152
That puke had a threesome
with my kitty cat.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.203
All right, so you do then.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.415
Whoa man. Look, you know
you should probably be thanking me.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.493
[MARK] Your girl needed
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.669
She was gonna die
and H saved her life.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.622
More than once actually.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.292
I'm gonna make you a stain.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.515
Feeling a bit parched?
Fancy a drink?

20:27.727 --> 20:28.512

Yeah.

[MAN grunts]

20:34.234 --> 20:36.316
[MARK] All right, stop me if
you've heard this before, but...

20:36.528 --> 20:39.065
screwdriver walks into
a bar, bartender says,

20:39.280 --> 20:40.235
--[TR|CK] Youth.
--[MARK] "Hey, we've got

20:40.448 --> 20:42.188
a drink named after you."

20:42.409 --> 20:44.149
He says, " Really? You've
got a drink named Murray?"

20:45.203 --> 20:46.739
It's for Bo's birthday.

20:46.955 --> 20:48.161
You okay?

20:48.373 --> 20:51.206
Ever hear three dozen balloons
pop simultaneously in a car?

20:51.418 --> 20:53.704
It's loud. Very, very loud.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.456
[TRICK] It's beautiful.

20:57.465 --> 20:58.875
[LAUREN] Ugh.

21:02.554 --> 21:04.169
[MAN groans]

21:10.770 --> 21:18.688
[sighs]

21:18.903 --> 21:21.315
It was supposed to be chocolate.

21:25.827 --> 21:29.319
Could someone explain to me
why I am breaking up bar fights

21:29.539 --> 21:31.450
instead of helping
locate missing oracles?

21:31.666 --> 21:34.157
Hey. Who called
McGruff the Crime Dog?

21:34.377 --> 21:35.583
[chuckles]

21:35.795 --> 21:38.707
[DYSON] And Trick's
ledger is missing.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.424
You happen to know
anything about that?

21:40.633 --> 21:43.591
Don't look at me, mate.
I was just a bystander.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.043
I barely know the kid.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.379
[DYSON]
Good. Keep it that way.

21:47.599 --> 21:50.386
Stay away from my son.

21:50.602 --> 21:52.558
Whoa, whoa. Hold your horses.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.351
[chuckles]

21:54.564 --> 21:58.022
Let me get this straight.
Catalog face is your kid?

21:58.234 --> 22:00.316
And cue the violins.

22:00.528 --> 22:03.235
[chuckles]

22:03.448 --> 22:05.279
You are my son.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.238
[DYSON] A warrior.

22:13.458 --> 22:14.948
I won't let you ruin
that for him, Vex.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.250
[MARK] The only
one doing that is you.

22:17.462 --> 22:20.579
You enjoy chasing your
tail for other people.

22:20.798 --> 22:23.335
Guess what? I don't.

22:24.302 --> 22:26.463
You have a birthright to claim.

22:27.972 --> 22:28.836
Whether you know it or not,

22:29.057 --> 22:31.093
soon you'll have to
choose who to serve.

22:31.309 --> 22:35.018
Yeah, that's easy. Me.

22:35.230 --> 22:37.186
You have a lot to learn.

22:37.398 --> 22:38.854
[MARK] Oh, is that so?

22:39.067 --> 22:41.353
See, 'cause the
way I see it is that

22:41.569 --> 22:44.652
you're either
the boss or the bitch.

22:47.242 --> 22:48.982
Which one are you?

22:49.202 --> 22:52.490
Big words from a shifter
who hasn't shifted yet.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.115
I don't want your life.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.301
I didn't order this.

23:16.521 --> 23:17.886
[TAMSIN] It's from
a guy at the bar.

23:18.106 --> 23:22.315
Ugh, man. This luck
thing is getting so old.

23:28.491 --> 23:30.982
No, I get it. You don't
want to mess up your lipstick.

23:31.202 --> 23:33.067
Operation skeezebag's a go.

23:35.039 --> 23:36.324
Heratio.

23:36.541 --> 23:37.496
[BO chuckles]

23:37.709 --> 23:39.040
It's so good to meet you.

23:39.252 --> 23:42.119
Wow. Your profile pictures
did not do you justice.

23:42.338 --> 23:45.080
Eh, bathroom selfies;
always a risk.

23:45.300 --> 23:49.760
And you. Words cannot
describe except, "Wow!"

23:49.971 --> 23:51.711
[HERATIO] Just, wow.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.298
You know, a dress like
yours has me worried

23:55.518 --> 23:57.600
that you're hiding
something twisted.

23:57.812 --> 24:02.397
Well, I am in that
I am very flexible.

24:02.609 --> 24:06.773
And forward. I like it.
Makes my job easier.

24:06.988 --> 24:08.649
And what job might that be?

24:08.865 --> 24:11.231
Getting you to kiss
me by the end of this.

24:11.451 --> 24:14.284
Well, lucky for you,
I'm a Magic 8 Ball

24:14.495 --> 24:17.157
and the outlook is positive.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.076
Mmm.

24:25.048 --> 24:26.288
What are you doing?

24:26.507 --> 24:27.917
What?

24:28.134 --> 24:30.967
Hm.

24:31.179 --> 24:33.261
Do you wanna get outta here?

24:33.473 --> 24:34.713
[HERATIO] I know a place
that's better than this.

24:34.932 --> 24:36.183
It's more intimate.

24:36.392 --> 24:39.054
And there's killer Tiramisu.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.511
Well, sounds like heaven.

24:42.732 --> 24:45.519
It is. In your mouth.

24:45.735 --> 24:50.946
Well, I can think of something
else that's heaven in my mouth.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.445
Reflexes like a cat.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.781
Yeah, you're not the only one.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.492
Will you excuse me just
one second? Bathroom break.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.122
Sure.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.925
Oh my god.
Something is wrong.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.511
Like, big wrong, real wrong.

25:14.597 --> 25:17.714
Are you stress panting?

25:17.934 --> 25:19.925
Okay, something's really wrong.
I don't like this; we should go.

25:20.144 --> 25:23.432
No. Not until I find out
what he did with Cassie.

25:23.648 --> 25:24.854
Okay, well you better
Indiana Jones your way

25:25.066 --> 25:26.556
through that side door,
'cause he's leaving.

25:28.695 --> 25:29.650
[HERATIO] Are you ready?

25:29.862 --> 25:34.026
Yes. Of course, uh.
But before we go.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.325
I know you were the
last one to see Cassie

25:38.538 --> 25:40.494
before she went missing.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.322
[BO] What did you do with her?

25:42.542 --> 25:45.375
I kissed her goodnight
and then I left.

25:45.586 --> 25:48.623
And then you went inside
and you attacked her.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.125
I didn't hurt her.
I kissed her goodnight

25:50.341 --> 25:52.172
and then I left
like a gentleman.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.421
But you...

25:54.637 --> 25:56.844
[HERATIO]
I could never leave you.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.092
That doesn't make any sense.

25:59.308 --> 26:00.923
If it wasn't you, then...?

26:04.564 --> 26:07.897
Something's come up. Call me.

26:09.819 --> 26:10.774
What happened?

26:10.987 --> 26:12.352
Whoa! Holy hand hair!

26:12.572 --> 26:14.904
Cat scratch fever anyone?

26:15.116 --> 26:17.653
Ugh! Geez.

26:43.019 --> 26:45.510
Ow! Ow!

26:45.730 --> 26:47.971
So I'm turning into a cat.

26:48.191 --> 26:49.226
[TAMSIN]
I'm so sorry, Bo.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.103
I feel like this
is all my fault.

26:51.319 --> 26:53.275
I don't get it.
Is Bo a shifter now?

26:53.488 --> 26:54.443
[TRICK] Not exactly.

26:54.655 --> 26:57.271
The cat you gave
her is an aitvaras.

26:57.492 --> 26:59.323
By bringing good
luck to its owner,

26:59.535 --> 27:02.368
it steals it from those
who don't pay it reverence.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.070
All this because
I didn't respect the

27:04.290 --> 27:06.076
stuffed corpse of a dead cat?

27:06.292 --> 27:08.874
[LAUREN] Ah, hand cramp!
Hand cramp.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.337
Well we've gotta get working.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.047
It's only a matter
of time before

27:12.256 --> 27:14.872
[TRICK] its spirit
takes over permanently.

27:15.092 --> 27:17.549
That's it. I'm blowing
this thing to Hell.

27:17.762 --> 27:20.128
Are you gonna let her
talk to you like that?

27:20.348 --> 27:22.805
No. We can't destroy it
while it's feeding Bo luck.

27:23.017 --> 27:24.678
[TRICK] It'll instantly
devour her spirit.

27:24.894 --> 27:26.634
She will die.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.719
Okay, we have to think here.

27:28.940 --> 27:31.306
There has to be a way
to reverse the effects.

27:31.526 --> 27:34.063
I should've just gotten
you a Yeti stripper.

27:34.278 --> 27:35.814
Oh, it--Oh.

27:36.030 --> 27:39.193
[purrs]

27:39.408 --> 27:41.785
Okay, 'kay wait. Just,
relax, everybody. Okay?

27:41.994 --> 27:44.371
Just calm down, Tamsin.

27:44.580 --> 27:47.697
Look, we know
that this thing works.

27:47.917 --> 27:49.498
[BO] What if it's
the key to finding Cassie?

27:49.710 --> 27:52.042
What if I use
the luck to find her?

27:52.255 --> 27:53.745
No, embracing the
luck means embracing

27:53.965 --> 27:56.001
transforming into
a cat. I don't approve.

27:56.217 --> 27:57.753
Plus, we don't even
have any solid leads.

27:57.969 --> 27:58.833
[LAUREN] Yeah, and you're
not going to be any good

27:59.053 --> 28:00.964
in this state. We have
to worry about you.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.296
I agree with Lauren.
The case can wait.

28:03.516 --> 28:07.429
Okay, Cassie, she has a
gift that people want to use.

28:07.645 --> 28:09.727
[BO] I mean, you said
it yourself, Tamsin.

28:09.939 --> 28:11.895
A missing oracle is
a dangerous thing.

28:12.108 --> 28:16.442
And as annoying as she
has been, she's a friend.

28:16.654 --> 28:18.269
She helped us save Dyson.

28:19.448 --> 28:22.940
Okay. What are
you proposing we do?

28:26.664 --> 28:28.575
[TAMSIN]
You cannot be serious.

28:28.791 --> 28:30.747
Free money,
lost earrings, drinks,

28:30.960 --> 28:32.370
Cassie's pocket dial.

28:32.587 --> 28:34.919
I'm gonna let blind
luck lead me to Cassie.

28:35.715 --> 28:38.001
Bo, I know you're
worried about Cassie,

28:38.217 --> 28:40.833
[TAMSIN] but this is a
little kamikaze of you.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.839
I mean, this is
even kamikaze for me.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.431
Yeah. Which is
why Tamsin and l,

28:44.640 --> 28:45.595
we're puting our foot down.

28:45.808 --> 28:47.639
[BO] I need you guys
to trust me, okay?

28:47.852 --> 28:51.640
Not just trust, believe.
Believe that I can do this.

28:51.856 --> 28:53.096
Bo, it's not that
we don't trust you--

28:53.316 --> 28:54.351
I'm in.

28:54.567 --> 28:55.556
[TAMSIN] I know
you need support,

28:55.776 --> 28:57.186
and I got you.

28:58.446 --> 29:00.937
Oh. Oh, I get it. I get it.

29:01.157 --> 29:03.739
Old stick in the mud's Lewis
won't join the suicide party.

29:03.951 --> 29:06.909
Well, y'know what? I'm in too.

29:09.749 --> 29:10.704
Son of a--!

29:10.917 --> 29:11.781
Are we good?

29:12.001 --> 29:13.332
How many fingers
am I holding up?

29:13.544 --> 29:14.294
How old are you?

29:14.503 --> 29:16.414
Gives new meaning to
the term blind spot, huh guys?

29:16.631 --> 29:17.370
[sighs]

29:17.590 --> 29:19.581
Luck be my lady tonight.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.791
Uh, okay, but
what if her bad luck

29:22.011 --> 29:23.217
cancels out your good luck?

29:23.429 --> 29:25.215
[engine starts]

29:31.979 --> 29:36.848
[LAUREN] Oh, okay.
Okay, that's fast.

29:37.068 --> 29:39.434
O
kay... Bo!

29:47.828 --> 29:48.863
This is the place.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.786
[TAMSIN] Are you sure?

29:50.998 --> 29:54.035
Of course you are. You're the
one leading this gong show.

29:55.044 --> 29:56.625
[coughing]

29:56.837 --> 29:58.088
What's the matter, Lauren?

29:58.297 --> 29:59.252
I thought you were
all boom boom pow

29:59.465 --> 30:00.921
over Bo's crazy wheel?

30:01.133 --> 30:02.168
[coughs]

30:02.385 --> 30:04.046
You totally swallowed
a bug, didn't you?

30:05.554 --> 30:08.717
Oh, come on. Seriously?

30:08.933 --> 30:11.470
Heads we go west,
tails we go east.

30:13.646 --> 30:15.511
Tails it is.

30:16.774 --> 30:18.355
M'kay.

30:24.699 --> 30:26.314
You're not kidding.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.911
Huh?

30:41.132 --> 30:43.669
Oh. You're not
happy to see me.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.875
No, you know what?
Actually, I'm thrilled.

30:46.095 --> 30:49.303
[MARK] That means
you brought it back.

30:49.515 --> 30:52.257
The book that
you took earlier today.

30:52.476 --> 30:54.728
[MARK] I mean
that was you, right?

30:54.937 --> 30:56.768
What book?

30:56.981 --> 30:57.970
You know what? Forget it.

30:58.190 --> 31:01.273
I'm kind of in the middle of a
self-made crap storm right now.

31:02.319 --> 31:05.061
After a storm.

31:05.281 --> 31:06.361
What?

31:06.574 --> 31:09.532
After a storm is the best part.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.873
Oh my god, it worked.

31:22.089 --> 31:23.750
It doesn't always work.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.257
What can you do?

31:27.470 --> 31:29.426
I'm a shifter.

31:29.638 --> 31:31.720
Well, I know but,
shift into what?

31:31.932 --> 31:34.093
[gasps] I like pandas.

31:34.310 --> 31:36.596
[chuckles]
|--| don't know yet.

31:36.812 --> 31:39.645
Kinda starting to
wish I did though.

31:39.857 --> 31:42.473
Well isn't there someone
you can talk to about that?

31:43.652 --> 31:46.268
Yeah. Yeah, except...

31:46.489 --> 31:47.774
y'know he's an
opinionated jerk who thinks

31:47.990 --> 31:50.732
life's only about serving
other people. So...

31:50.951 --> 31:55.365
Hm. Well... I serve my keepers.

31:55.581 --> 31:56.661
[chuckles]

31:56.874 --> 31:58.660
I'm sorry. Your keepers?

31:58.876 --> 32:00.582
I mean, my parents.

32:00.795 --> 32:02.660
No. Doesn't mean
I'm subservient.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.711
It means I'm important.

32:07.134 --> 32:09.341
Maybe that's what
you're really afraid of.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.214
Being counted on.

32:12.807 --> 32:14.217
[scoffs]

32:16.477 --> 32:20.595
[TAMSIN] Cassie! Here Cassie,
Cassie, Cassie.

32:20.815 --> 32:22.396
We should be at
home looking after Bo.

32:22.608 --> 32:23.688
You don't think I know that?

32:23.901 --> 32:25.641
Well what are we
still doing out here?

32:25.861 --> 32:27.897
Well, I trust her.

32:28.114 --> 32:30.355
[LAUREN] Okay, here we go.

32:30.574 --> 32:33.361
Y'know, you think you're
the only one in the race.

32:33.577 --> 32:36.159
Well, guess what? There's
a new pony on the green.

32:36.372 --> 32:38.203
Racing or golf?
Pick a metaphor.

32:38.415 --> 32:40.872
Like it or not, Bo and
I are getting closer.

32:41.085 --> 32:42.325
And it's not just because
we're living together.

32:42.545 --> 32:44.877
There's something...
amazing happening.

32:45.089 --> 32:49.173
I'm very happy for you.
Still worried about Bo.

32:52.096 --> 32:53.506
Bo?

32:55.432 --> 32:56.842
Bo?

32:58.769 --> 33:00.100
Where is she?

33:21.917 --> 33:23.748
[BO grunts]

33:27.715 --> 33:29.205
Glad I wasn't a dog.

33:29.425 --> 33:31.006
[distant gasp]

33:41.729 --> 33:44.311
[WOMEN gasp]

33:46.525 --> 33:49.187
[whimpering]

33:49.403 --> 33:51.610
Oh my god, Cassie.

33:51.822 --> 33:53.153
[BO] Oh my god.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.320
You're okay.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.397
You're okay. I've got you.

33:55.618 --> 33:57.324
[LAUREN] Bo?

33:57.536 --> 33:59.527
I've got you. I'm gonna
get you outta here.

33:59.747 --> 34:01.283
[BO] You're safe now.

34:06.921 --> 34:09.207
You're doing really great, Bo.

34:12.051 --> 34:15.088
Agh, ugh!
Where is Dyson?

34:19.808 --> 34:21.218
Watch your step.

34:22.645 --> 34:24.476
[DYSON] I checked Seymour's
bank accounts here.

34:24.688 --> 34:27.805
Seems Herati055 paid him
off for information on Cassie.

34:28.025 --> 34:31.017
But, Bo and I cleared Heratio.
She questioned him herself.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.603
Well maybe she didn't
ask the right questions.

34:34.698 --> 34:37.110
You sold out your
own flesh and blood?

34:37.326 --> 34:39.032
It was business.
What was I supposed to do?

34:39.245 --> 34:40.735
I had to get paid somehow.

34:40.955 --> 34:42.195
[SEYMOUR] People don't
get paid to suck spirits.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.281
Maybe you just suck period.

34:45.501 --> 34:46.741
You know, Tamsin,
maybe you're just being

34:46.961 --> 34:48.371
a bit harsh.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.002
Seems Seymour,
here, is just a little bit

34:51.215 --> 34:52.625
down on his luck is all.

34:52.841 --> 34:55.378
Oh. Yeah. My heart
really bleeds for him.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.754
Who's team are you on, D?

34:56.971 --> 34:57.926
I'm just saying
that not everyone has

34:58.138 --> 35:00.675
the kind of luck Bo has.

35:00.891 --> 35:03.633
Yeah? What makes
her so damn lucky?

35:03.852 --> 35:07.185
[TAMSIN] Oh, you know.
Just some silly superstition.

35:07.398 --> 35:09.889
Only bought into by idiots.

35:10.109 --> 35:11.315
I'm listenin'.

35:11.527 --> 35:13.609
It's Bo's lucky cat. See? Dumb.

35:13.821 --> 35:15.607
What Tamsin's
saying is the cat is

35:15.823 --> 35:17.688
imbued with an ancient spirit.

35:17.908 --> 35:19.523
It brings luck to its owner.

35:19.743 --> 35:20.698
And it works?

35:20.911 --> 35:23.778
Uh, not for you. It's Bo's.

35:23.998 --> 35:25.784
Not anymore it isn't.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.164
[inhales deeply]

35:30.379 --> 35:31.915
Ah...!

35:32.131 --> 35:34.838
[chuckles] I needed that.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.257
Listen. Hate to snort and
run, but I'm goin' to Reno.

35:37.469 --> 35:38.720
Gonna win me some kitty.

35:38.929 --> 35:40.590
You have no idea.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.764
I'd say wish me luck, but...
I don't need it.

35:46.562 --> 35:47.972
Whoa.

35:49.565 --> 35:50.975
[TAMSIN] Bo?

35:53.485 --> 35:54.736
Why am I in a box?

35:54.945 --> 35:55.650
Ugh...

35:55.863 --> 35:57.478
I've said it before,
I'll say it again.

35:57.698 --> 35:59.609
I hate cats.

36:04.621 --> 36:07.078
[monitor beeping]

36:07.291 --> 36:08.952
Hey.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.658
[LAUREN] Oh, hey.

36:10.878 --> 36:11.833
Is Bo resting?

36:12.046 --> 36:14.583
[DYSON]
Yeah. How's Cassie?

36:14.798 --> 36:16.709
Well, she woke up
when the medics came

36:16.925 --> 36:17.914
to remove her from the cave.

36:18.135 --> 36:19.750
I had to give her a sedative.

36:19.970 --> 36:21.835
And her eyesight?

36:22.056 --> 36:25.298
Well, we'll do our best to
repair the tissue damage,

36:25.517 --> 36:28.554
but without the oculus
our field is limited.

36:30.189 --> 36:32.350
Three oracles, Dyson,
all without their eyes.

36:32.566 --> 36:34.352
It doesn't make sense.

36:34.568 --> 36:36.479
That's not the only thing.

36:37.780 --> 36:40.442
The guy that Bo went out on
a date with; Herati055?

36:40.657 --> 36:41.863
Did you get a look at him?

36:42.076 --> 36:43.907
[LAUREN] I didn't
study his profile. Why?

36:44.119 --> 36:46.496
You recognize him?

36:46.705 --> 36:48.616
[LAUREN] It's Kevin Brown.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.572
He was one of the dead
bodies from the elevator crash

36:50.793 --> 36:52.875
that went missing
from the clinic.

36:54.922 --> 36:56.833
Bo went on a date
with a dead man.

37:00.928 --> 37:08.721
[dream pop song begins]

37:08.936 --> 37:10.551
I'm bad at birthdays.

37:10.771 --> 37:17.358
[dream pop song continues]

37:17.569 --> 37:18.399
[chuckles]

37:18.612 --> 37:22.696
It's from Rosa's. Lauren tried
to make a cake, but um...

37:22.908 --> 37:26.776
Oh. So that's what
happened in the kitchen.

37:26.995 --> 37:29.486
[BO] I thought you
were night eating again.

37:35.379 --> 37:36.789
You were amazing today.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.666
Mmm.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.588
Mmm.

37:40.801 --> 37:42.462
If there is something
better than this,

37:42.678 --> 37:45.135
I have not encountered it.

37:51.979 --> 37:53.469
Don't be so sure.

37:55.691 --> 37:57.181
You still feeling lucky?

37:57.401 --> 38:19.121
[dream pop music continues]

38:19.339 --> 38:21.421
Happy birthday to me.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.436
Girls must've hated you.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.982
You're beautiful even like this.

38:48.202 --> 38:49.567
[chuckles lightly]

38:49.786 --> 38:52.198
Like what?

38:52.414 --> 38:54.029
Sad.

38:59.213 --> 39:03.126
I know something's
been bugging you.

39:03.342 --> 39:06.926
[TAMSIN] I've tried
to ignore it, but...

39:07.137 --> 39:09.674
Just tell me what it is.

39:23.153 --> 39:24.984
l was born in Hell.

39:27.783 --> 39:30.240
[BO] I found out
when I was in Tartarus.

39:33.205 --> 39:35.821
My dad is Hades.

39:41.088 --> 39:45.001
Family Christmas card is
gonna be awkward this year, huh?

39:45.217 --> 39:47.048
That was him.

39:49.429 --> 39:52.796
Who I sat across from
when I made the deal.

39:55.769 --> 39:58.556
Eyes both brown and blue.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.110
That was Hades.

40:12.327 --> 40:16.696
[TAMSIN] Did you talk to him?

40:16.915 --> 40:20.032
Nope.

40:20.252 --> 40:22.868
Not that it would have
made any difference.

40:24.464 --> 40:27.922
[BO] No matter how hard
I try to get away from him.

40:28.135 --> 40:30.842
No matter how much
good I try to do.

40:33.348 --> 40:35.430
He'll always be part of me.

40:39.855 --> 40:42.892
And he'll always find me.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.723
[TAMSIN] Gift from Daddy.

40:52.367 --> 40:57.077
When I was younger I used
to think Freyja controlled me.

40:57.289 --> 40:59.951
Controlled how I felt...

41:00.167 --> 41:02.123
[TAMSIN] What I did...

41:03.920 --> 41:05.456
Everything.

41:05.672 --> 41:08.755
What changed?

41:08.967 --> 41:10.207
Me.

41:10.427 --> 41:11.212
You got empowered.

41:11.428 --> 41:13.419
Mmm, I got angry.

41:18.435 --> 41:22.303
I need to find a way to separate
myself from him for good.

41:22.522 --> 41:25.434
[BO] So he can never
hurt my real family again.

41:26.526 --> 41:28.858
He's trying to use
me for something.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.318
Something terrible.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.078
Then we won't let him.

41:42.793 --> 41:43.873
No.

41:44.086 --> 41:44.871
Stay away.

41:45.087 --> 41:46.042
Cassie.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.745
It's okay. It's okay.

41:48.965 --> 41:50.501
[LAUREN] It's okay.
You're safe here.

41:50.717 --> 41:53.424
It's me. It's Lauren.
Doctor Lewis.

41:53.637 --> 41:57.425
[CASSIE whimpers]
Doctor Lewis.

41:57.641 --> 41:58.801
Where am I?

41:59.017 --> 42:03.511
You're in my clinic.
Nobody can hurt you here.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.436
We do need to find
out who did this to you.

42:05.649 --> 42:07.230
What do you remember?

42:10.904 --> 42:12.144
[CASSIE] No...

42:12.364 --> 42:15.527
Come on. Think back.

42:15.742 --> 42:17.858
What did you see?

42:18.745 --> 42:20.861
Everything.

42:21.081 --> 42:24.665
All of it. The Universe.
Every single moment since

42:24.876 --> 42:26.832
[CASSIE]
the beginning of time. |--| couldn't--

42:27.045 --> 42:29.331
You couldn't--
You--You couldn't what?

42:29.548 --> 42:31.334
It was too much.

42:32.426 --> 42:34.838
The beginning.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.008
The end.

42:36.221 --> 42:38.587
The end? The end of--of what?

42:38.807 --> 42:41.799
Oh, come on Cassie.
Who did this to you?

42:45.564 --> 42:47.270
Me.

42:47.482 --> 42:51.270
[CASSIE] I did. I did.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.693
We did it to ourselves.

42:56.867 --> 42:58.232
Why?

42:58.452 --> 43:01.159
[LAUREN] Why would you
remove your own eyes?

43:02.873 --> 43:05.865
It was the only
way to make it stop.

43:18.013 --> 43:19.549
[MAN sighs]

43:21.933 --> 43:23.514
Bo Dennis.

43:28.857 --> 43:30.643
Nice try, Succubus.

43:36.114 --> 43:41.108
