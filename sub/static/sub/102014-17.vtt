00:04.295 --> 00:06.548
[bells chiming]

00:06.589 --> 00:09.509
[Betty] Ten nights working
the Lonely Highway,

00:09.551 --> 00:10.760
and not even a nibble.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.973
Truckers are not
stopping for us.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.599
Though I'm sure
we'd have better luck

00:16.641 --> 00:20.520
at catching our killers
if we were flying solo.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.689
Ten quiet nights
with no new murders

00:22.731 --> 00:24.441
is a win in my book.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.735
When serial killers go quiet,

00:26.776 --> 00:29.029
that is when
you should be afraid.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.656
That is when
their desire to hunt

00:31.698 --> 00:34.659
and kill is building up
inside of them.

00:34.701 --> 00:35.660
[cell phone ringing]

00:39.372 --> 00:42.250
Dr. Curdle Jr.,
it's early for you.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.586
I'm calling about
our tongueless friend.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.090
You asked me not to report him

00:49.132 --> 00:50.050
to the proper authorities,

00:50.091 --> 00:51.885
but I'm getting nervous

00:51.926 --> 00:54.763
keeping his corpse
in cold storage.

00:54.804 --> 00:55.805
I'd like your permission

00:55.847 --> 00:56.723
to incinerate the body

00:56.765 --> 00:58.224
in my crematorium.

00:58.266 --> 01:01.102
No. He's evidence
for the Lonely Highway case.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.354
It's risky for me,
Miss Cooper.

01:03.396 --> 01:06.316
And refrigeration is expensive.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.027
Why don't I come by in a bit
with a payment

01:09.069 --> 01:11.821
to help cover
your extra expenses?

01:11.863 --> 01:14.532
That would greatly ease
my anxiety.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.535
-Okay. I will see you
in a couple of hours.
-[line disconnects]

01:17.577 --> 01:19.162
And here I thought
leaving Chicago

01:19.204 --> 01:21.831
for Riverdale would
mean no nightlife. Huh.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.960
-See you at dusk?
-See you at dusk.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.129
[Cheryl] I had just about
given up hope, Archie.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.381
We haven't found the mother
lode of palladium yet,

01:30.423 --> 01:31.508
but I have faith.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.260
Look, Cheryl, about that.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.262
Me and the guys,
we're down there breaking
rocks for you,

01:36.304 --> 01:38.556
pulling 12-hour shifts,

01:38.598 --> 01:40.308
when there's so much
we could be doing topside.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.102
Ah, yes, your crusade
to save Riverdale,

01:42.143 --> 01:44.896
which consists of what,
at this point?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.314
Filling in potholes?

01:46.356 --> 01:47.607
Maintaining
the town's infrastructure

01:47.649 --> 01:50.068
until we can
get reincorporated.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.694
Which I'm happy to do
on my days off,

01:51.736 --> 01:53.530
-but it costs money.
-I know where this is going.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.573
If I'm putting my crew's focus
on the mines,

01:55.615 --> 01:57.158
then I need your assurance

01:57.200 --> 01:58.701
that if we find
that palladium--

01:58.743 --> 02:00.161
You and your men will
be fairly compensated.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.330
[exhales sharply]
In fact, I will deposit

02:02.372 --> 02:05.125
a modest finder's fee via Chime

02:05.166 --> 02:06.459
-in exchange for the nugget.
-[phone chimes]

02:06.501 --> 02:08.086
[Archie's phone chimes]

02:08.128 --> 02:10.004
[Cheryl] In the future,
a portion of whatever

02:10.046 --> 02:11.464
you unearth will be set aside

02:11.506 --> 02:13.508
to subsidize
your revitalization efforts.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.427
Then we will work
our asses off for you.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.139
Let's move on
to the house in Sag Harbor.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.473
That's mine. And I won't sign

02:20.515 --> 02:21.933
the divorce papers
unless I get it.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.727
I bought that house, Chad,

02:24.769 --> 02:27.105
with money I made
on Wall Street.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.899
-I want alimony, too.
-Fine, you worm.

02:29.941 --> 02:30.900
And this apartment.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.111
Fine.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.613
Fine. Take the Pembrooke.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.240
And you know what?

02:37.282 --> 02:39.117
-Take this ring
and rot in hell.
-[ring clatters]

02:39.159 --> 02:40.994
I don't care, Chad.
Take it all.

02:41.035 --> 02:43.997
All I want,
all I need is Archie.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.879
Poor, dim,
impressionable Kevin.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.175
I'm worried for you.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.843
When I started
this ministry,

02:56.885 --> 02:59.971
it was with nothing
but the purest of intentions.

03:00.013 --> 03:04.475
And now Cheryl has twisted it
into something profane.

03:04.517 --> 03:07.020
Dare I say, cult-like.

03:07.061 --> 03:08.646
When Cheryl made
those bees dance

03:08.688 --> 03:10.106
to her infernal tune,

03:10.148 --> 03:13.985
I got distinct
Wicker Man-like vibes.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.571
If this religion's a cult,
then you're in it, too.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.908
Mm. Please.
My will is a steel rod.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.160
Can you say the same?

03:27.457 --> 03:28.791
[telephone ringing]

03:30.126 --> 03:31.461
Pop's, this is Tabitha.

03:33.254 --> 03:37.175
Oh, Mrs. Fields, of course.
How's Squeaky doing?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.927
Riverdale is done with me.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.095
And I am done with Riverdale.

03:41.137 --> 03:43.973
No. No, I... I haven't heard
from her since she left.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.646
I admit,
when Mr. Weatherbee told me

03:49.687 --> 03:52.023
that two students had
gotten into a fight,

03:52.065 --> 03:53.399
you're the last person
I thought would've been

03:53.441 --> 03:54.567
involved with that, Britta.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.656
[exhales] I punched
Tim Higgins once.

03:59.697 --> 04:02.075
And only because
he wouldn't stop calling me...

04:04.410 --> 04:05.912
homophobic names.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.666
Well, that's
completely unacceptable.

04:09.707 --> 04:10.750
I'll talk to Tim.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.211
But violence isn't the answer.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.545
I know.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.298
The thing is,
Ms. Topaz, I think I am.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.635
Gay.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.179
I mean, I haven't told
my family yet or anything.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.973
Coming out can be a process.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.475
And sometimes a difficult one.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.311
It was for me when I came out.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.147
But the good news is...

04:33.189 --> 04:35.817
only you get to decide when
is the right time for you.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.113
And I'll be here if you need
anybody to talk to.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.949
If I wanted to talk
to my parents,

04:42.991 --> 04:44.242
would you be there with me?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.368
Absolutely.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.621
I'd be honored.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.498
So, my daughter
continues to be

04:50.540 --> 04:53.167
as much a thorn in your side
as she is mine, huh?

04:53.209 --> 04:54.877
I keep hoping
we might reconcile.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.046
You won't.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.716
Not as long as Archie
is in the picture.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.884
See, it's one of the things
I've learned over the years.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.761
My daughter's
greatest vulnerability

05:03.803 --> 05:05.221
is her love for Archie.

05:06.472 --> 05:09.309
So if you want a shot in hell

05:09.350 --> 05:10.977
at saving your marriage,

05:15.023 --> 05:16.316
you're going to have
to get rid of him.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.277
It's a ghost gun.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.072
No serial numbers. Untraceable.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.495
Hey.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.997
I just finished practice
with the Vixens.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.541
Do you want to ride back
to Thornhill together?

05:33.583 --> 05:35.501
Actually, Cheryl,
can I ask you something?

05:36.627 --> 05:38.588
When we pray,

05:38.629 --> 05:39.964
who are we praying to?

05:40.006 --> 05:42.091
-Jason?
-Um...

05:42.133 --> 05:44.552
Jason is more of a conduit.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.220
A messenger
to the higher power.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.680
Which is what, exactly?

05:49.432 --> 05:50.975
I'm not sure.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.935
-Let me fast on it.
-What?

05:52.977 --> 05:55.021
Well, it's like
doing a cleanse.
No solid food.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.606
Only hot water
with lemon, maple syrup

05:56.647 --> 05:58.358
and a hint of cayenne pepper.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.734
It flushes you out completely,

05:59.776 --> 06:01.903
and then once I'm empty,

06:01.944 --> 06:04.614
I can be refilled with wisdom

06:04.655 --> 06:06.824
and answers for you, Kev-Kev.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.373
[Tabitha] I'm worried
about a friend of mine.

06:13.414 --> 06:17.001
A waitress who used
to work here, Squeaky.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.961
Her mom called and said
that she never made it

06:19.003 --> 06:20.421
to her friends in California.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.090
Oh, God. Tabitha, I'm sorry.

06:22.131 --> 06:24.801
Me, too.
Is there anything
I can do to help?

06:24.842 --> 06:27.178
There is, Jughead.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.306
The Lonely Highway killings
are a mystery, right?

06:30.348 --> 06:32.350
And everyone tells me
that there wasn't a mystery

06:32.392 --> 06:34.227
you two couldn't solve
back in the day.

06:34.268 --> 06:37.480
So... I'm canceling
all of your shifts.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.816
You'll still get
your weekly paycheck,

06:39.857 --> 06:41.234
but it won't be to bus tables.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.652
It will be to help Betty.

06:42.693 --> 06:45.113
Betty, are you down
with this plan?

06:45.154 --> 06:46.823
Yeah. Yes.

06:46.864 --> 06:48.699
-Jughead?
-Sure.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.453
Great. What's the first step?

06:52.495 --> 06:54.080
Well, I'm assuming that
you have thorough case files.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.332
-Yeah.
-I'll start by reading those.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.339
-[siren wailing in distance]
-[object clattering]

07:08.010 --> 07:09.095
Chad?

07:16.853 --> 07:17.895
-[grunts]
-[groans]

07:23.609 --> 07:24.777
[dog barking in distance]

07:39.167 --> 07:42.628
[footsteps approaching]

07:42.670 --> 07:46.382
So you captured a guy
who more or less confessed.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.050
And then they swallowed
their own tongue

07:48.092 --> 07:50.470
because they thought you were
going to dismember them?

07:52.221 --> 07:54.599
Yeah. That's sort of the last
big thing that happened.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.976
And you still think this is
several serial killers working

07:57.018 --> 07:59.353
-in tandem over the years?
-Yeah. Yes.

07:59.395 --> 08:03.399
A family of truckers who have
been kidnapping and murdering

08:03.441 --> 08:05.860
hitchhikers and sex workers.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.361
And Lerman Marshall Logan.

08:09.238 --> 08:11.157
My ex-student that disappeared
on the Lonely Highway

08:11.199 --> 08:13.659
and was... somewhere
for, like, a week, remember?

08:13.701 --> 08:15.244
Yeah, yeah, no.
I've been thinking about him

08:15.286 --> 08:17.246
and he doesn't fit
any of the victim profiles,

08:17.288 --> 08:19.790
which might be a clue
in and of itself.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.250
He might be one
of the only people

08:21.292 --> 08:23.127
who actually encountered
this family of yours

08:23.169 --> 08:24.962
and survived. Now, at the time,

08:25.004 --> 08:26.547
Weatherbee didn't
let me talk to him

08:26.589 --> 08:28.341
because I was a teacher
and he was a student.

08:28.382 --> 08:30.426
But now Lerman has transferred
and I've been fired, so...

08:30.468 --> 08:31.511
So we need to talk to Lerman.

08:31.552 --> 08:32.803
Yeah, I'll find him on social.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.388
[cell phone ringing]

08:36.224 --> 08:38.184
Hi, Dr. Curdle. I'm so sorry.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.102
I have your money
in small bills.

08:40.144 --> 08:43.523
Another body's been brought in
from Swedlow Swamp, Ms. Cooper.

08:43.564 --> 08:47.151
I think you'll find it
very interesting.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.820
The victim is
unlike any we've found.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.490
The body has been
completely dismembered.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.950
Why would they change their MO?

08:53.991 --> 08:56.118
Maybe to make
the bodies harder to find.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.537
Have you identified
the victim yet?

08:57.578 --> 08:59.413
Unfortunately not.

08:59.455 --> 09:02.542
The body was mutilated
beyond all recognition.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.503
But, based on the level
of decomposition,

09:05.545 --> 09:07.630
it could be your sister.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.760
I'll need to perform a DNA test
on the remains,

09:12.802 --> 09:14.011
and then compare it to--

09:14.053 --> 09:16.180
Mine. Yeah, do it.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.350
There's also a waitress
from Pop's.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.602
Lynette "Squeaky" Fields.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.688
She vanished around
the same time as Polly.

09:23.729 --> 09:24.981
I'm going to reach out
to her family

09:25.022 --> 09:26.524
and ask for a sample as well.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.654
[Veronica] It's so funny, Chad.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.156
Your pathetic attempt
to kill my lover

09:34.198 --> 09:36.826
has made me rethink what I want
out of this divorce.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.872
I'm getting everything.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.166
And you're getting nothing.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.752
And if you don't agree
to those terms,

09:46.794 --> 09:49.297
I'll seek to press
murder charges against you.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.549
-How?
-You dropped the gun, idiot.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.557
Check and mate,
you little bitch.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.854
Mm, these croissants are
positively divine.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.815
You should try one, dear child.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.191
I already told you, Mother.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.403
I'm fasting for enlightenment.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.947
As a matter of fact,
I'm feeling rather...

10:14.989 --> 10:17.158
-Lightheaded?
-Inspired.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.660
I am going to go paint

10:19.702 --> 10:21.662
and let the invisible hand
guide my brush.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.082
-Oh, my God. Cheryl.
-I'm fine.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.168
Just leave me be,
you doubting Thomases.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.216
I had Archie in my sights
but the gun misfired.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.343
[sighs]

10:37.094 --> 10:38.929
Veronica stole my palladium.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.809
Archie stole your wife.

10:43.851 --> 10:46.812
I thought one bullet would
right these two wrongs, but...

10:48.230 --> 10:49.607
As a wise man once said,

10:49.649 --> 10:51.692
never send in a boy
to do a man's job.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.862
Get out of my sight, Chad.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.448
You disgust me.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.075
Better yet,
get out of Riverdale.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.660
'Cause you lost
my daughter forever.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.419
Hi, handsome.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.839
Hey, Ronnie.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.217
What's going on?

11:16.258 --> 11:17.301
Guess what's in here.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.888
My divorce papers.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.432
It's official.
I'm a free woman.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.228
[upbeat music playing]

12:01.053 --> 12:02.430
Hey, you're going out?

12:02.471 --> 12:04.724
Yeah, I'm heading down
to the station.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.684
I don't mind the distraction
since Tom called

12:06.726 --> 12:08.894
and said that there was
another body found.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.855
Yeah. I went to the morgue.

12:12.773 --> 12:15.234
I don't know... if it's Polly.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.987
The body is...

12:19.071 --> 12:21.157
-What, Betty?
-It's...

12:21.198 --> 12:22.074
dismembered.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.619
-Oh, my God.
-I know.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.788
I know, but Jughead
and I have a lead.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.166
Okay.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.335
Keep me posted.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.590
[door closes]

12:37.631 --> 12:40.509
[Cheryl] Look at what
came out of me.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.429
This. This is
your answer, Kevin.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.181
The higher power
you've been praying to,

12:45.222 --> 12:46.891
drawing strength from.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.350
I don't understand.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.394
Earth, water, fire and wind.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.147
They're the fabric
of the natural world.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.774
I'm still not following.

12:54.815 --> 12:59.361
The higher power
is nature itself.

12:59.403 --> 13:02.573
That's what we should
be worshiping, Kevin.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.409
The elements.
It all makes perfect sense.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.538
How do you figure that?

13:09.580 --> 13:11.081
Well, for more than a century,

13:11.123 --> 13:12.541
we Blossoms have
made our livelihood

13:12.583 --> 13:13.667
from maple trees,

13:13.709 --> 13:15.961
but our roots go so much deeper

13:16.003 --> 13:17.630
than I've ever considered.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.590
[Kevin] So, when we pray, we...

13:20.800 --> 13:23.135
-pray to--
-Gaia. Mother Earth.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.056
Okay. Got it.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.310
You know, Cheryl...

13:32.978 --> 13:34.980
I'm really happy
that you found some clarity.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.193
But I think I'm out.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.987
This religion has gotten
a little too fringe-y,

13:42.029 --> 13:42.947
even for me.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.366
I hope that's okay.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.662
Of course, it's okay, Kev.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.580
You've always been free to go.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.916
But you will always have
a place here.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.760
What if Lerman doesn't
even show up?

14:04.802 --> 14:06.345
He will. I promised him

14:06.387 --> 14:08.430
my first edition copy
of War of the Worlds,

14:08.472 --> 14:10.057
which is actually
a fifth edition.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.851
[Tabitha] Hey, guys.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.728
[Alice] ...whoever is
terrorizing our town,

14:14.770 --> 14:18.023
committing these
inhumane murders,

14:18.065 --> 14:19.817
you have to stop.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.529
Every time the phone rings,

14:23.571 --> 14:25.614
I pray it's about my daughter.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.618
I pray for closure.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.663
Just today,
another victim was found.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.333
Their dismembered body is
down at the Riverdale morgue.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.043
What does it say about me

14:38.085 --> 14:40.045
that I want it
to be my daughter...

14:41.922 --> 14:43.924
so that
this nightmare will end?

14:45.175 --> 14:47.011
[voice breaking]
So that I can wake up.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.138
[crying] Please.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.806
-[door opens]
-Help me wake up.

14:50.848 --> 14:51.974
[Lerman] Mr. Jones?

14:52.933 --> 14:54.602
Sorry, my bus was late.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.897
[Fogarty sighs] Rough day, huh?

14:57.938 --> 15:00.065
I'm worried about one
of my students.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.901
Britta Beach.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.528
She's gay, and she asked me
to be there with her

15:04.570 --> 15:06.572
when she came out
to her parents.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.325
So, I was. And--

15:09.366 --> 15:10.367
Let me guess.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.202
They didn't immediately say,

15:12.244 --> 15:14.288
"We love you no matter what."

15:14.330 --> 15:16.790
Nope. They said,
"Are you sure?"

15:16.832 --> 15:19.627
-Ah.
-"Do you have to be?"

15:19.668 --> 15:21.795
I'm sorry, Toni. That sucks.

15:21.837 --> 15:23.339
Big time.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.132
It's such a lottery, you know?

15:25.174 --> 15:26.508
Who your parents are,

15:26.550 --> 15:29.053
what kind of family
you grow up in.

15:29.094 --> 15:32.431
I mean, it wasn't easy for me
when I came out to my nana.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.807
Yeah, my dad was pretty harsh

15:33.849 --> 15:35.601
when I told him I was bi.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.978
He was like, "Great.
You can choose,

15:38.020 --> 15:39.563
so choose being with a woman."

15:39.605 --> 15:41.565
[Toni chuckles sadly]

15:41.607 --> 15:44.360
I was like, "That's not
how that works, Dad."

15:45.027 --> 15:47.112
[softly] Yeah.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.572
So, is Britta going to be okay?

15:50.032 --> 15:52.785
I talked her parents
off the ledge, I think.

15:52.826 --> 15:53.911
[inhales]

15:53.953 --> 15:55.871
But she's a tough kid.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.457
So, I hope so.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.501
And, for the record,

16:00.542 --> 16:02.586
no matter what baby Anthony is,

16:03.545 --> 16:05.089
I'll be ecstatic.

16:05.881 --> 16:06.966
Same.

16:10.344 --> 16:11.971
[alarm beeping]

16:16.350 --> 16:18.268
-[explosion]
-[rumbling]

16:18.310 --> 16:19.645
What the heck was that?

16:19.687 --> 16:21.355
[slow rattling]

16:23.691 --> 16:25.025
[explosion]

16:27.111 --> 16:28.737
We need to get out
of here right now.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.155
Archie, Archie, Eric's working
further down the tunnel.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.365
Get everyone topside,
I'll find Eric.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.324
Archie!

16:32.366 --> 16:33.701
Guys, get out. Come on.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.828
Everybody out!
Let's go, move. Move!

16:37.287 --> 16:38.747
Everybody move. Move!

16:55.723 --> 16:57.933
[phone vibrating]

16:57.975 --> 16:59.184
[sighing impatiently]

16:59.226 --> 17:00.519
What is it, you philistine?

17:00.561 --> 17:02.021
I'm working
on my 12 Commandments.

17:04.481 --> 17:07.109
Oh, my God, Kev.
How many are still underground?

17:07.151 --> 17:08.235
[telephone ringing]

17:08.277 --> 17:10.029
Hello?

17:10.070 --> 17:11.321
Cheryl, what's up?

17:13.032 --> 17:15.743
Oh, my God. I'm on my way.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.369
[Jughead] Thank you again
for coming to meet us, Lerman.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.871
Not a problem, Mr. Jones.

17:18.912 --> 17:21.707
I felt bad ghosting you
like I did.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.459
That's okay. You're here now.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.960
And are you still willing
to talk about that week

17:25.002 --> 17:26.253
that you went missing?

17:26.295 --> 17:28.297
Yeah. Yeah. I'm ready to.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.924
Any details whatsoever could
help prevent this

17:30.966 --> 17:32.718
from happening
to anyone else, so...

17:32.760 --> 17:34.011
Most of it's fuzzy,

17:34.053 --> 17:35.929
but the best I can
piece together is

17:35.971 --> 17:38.640
I was sleepwalking
like I sometimes do

17:38.682 --> 17:40.476
along the Lonely Highway.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.227
Then, the next time I woke up,

17:42.269 --> 17:45.272
I was in this metal shed.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.733
It was small.
There weren't any windows.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.818
It looked like the inside
of a spaceship.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.738
That's how Polly described
where she was to my mom.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.406
What else do you remember?

17:54.448 --> 17:56.450
I could hear
voices outside sometimes.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.160
Voices? Plural?

17:58.202 --> 17:59.578
Yeah, maybe even a family?

17:59.620 --> 18:01.747
Were you alone in the shed?

18:01.789 --> 18:03.165
Yeah.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.209
'Til the Mothman came in

18:05.250 --> 18:08.212
-and helped me escape.
-The Mothman?

18:08.253 --> 18:09.254
That's what he called himself.

18:10.714 --> 18:11.840
He had red eyes.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.425
One bigger than the other.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.844
Or weird red markings
on his face.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.346
He said I was a mistake,

18:17.387 --> 18:19.181
that I shouldn't
have been caught,

18:19.223 --> 18:21.016
and that he was
throwing me back,

18:21.058 --> 18:22.976
the way you sometimes throw
a small fish back into a lake.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.479
Wait. So he let you go,

18:25.521 --> 18:27.564
he freed you from the shed,
and then he took you

18:27.606 --> 18:29.608
to the Lonely Highway
where you were found?

18:29.650 --> 18:32.277
He said I better not tell
anyone what had happened,

18:32.319 --> 18:34.530
or more Mothmen would
come back for me some night.

18:34.571 --> 18:37.491
Lerman, this is very important.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.493
Do you know where the shed is?

18:39.535 --> 18:42.287
No, but it was close
to the Lonely Highway.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.456
-I know that much.
-How do you know that?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.834
Because I could hear
the trucks rumbling by.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.794
[cell phone chimes]

18:48.836 --> 18:50.254
Dr. Curdle has the DNA results.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.005
He wants to tell us in person.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.258
Kevin, Cheryl,
what's the update?

18:54.299 --> 18:55.759
Been trying
Archie's phone, and Eric's.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.094
They're not getting
any signal down there.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.929
How long will it take
to dig them out?

18:58.971 --> 19:01.306
We need more hands on deck,
we need heavy duty equipment.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.517
And even then,
it'll take hours,
if not days.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.352
Okay.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.105
Whatever you need,
no matter the cost,
just do it.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.232
First, you said
there was an explosion.
What kind of explosion?

19:10.274 --> 19:12.109
Yeah, the kind that was
triggered deliberately.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.235
But who
in their right mind would

19:13.277 --> 19:14.611
blow up a mine on purpose?

19:16.947 --> 19:18.157
I can guess.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.328
[Archie coughing] Jackson.

19:29.626 --> 19:30.878
[coughing]

19:30.919 --> 19:33.463
-You with me, buddy?
-[grunts]

19:33.505 --> 19:34.965
I'm here, Sarge.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.049
Okay. Just hold on.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.222
You need to take
shallow breaths. Okay?

19:42.264 --> 19:43.724
We need to conserve
as much oxygen as possible.

19:43.765 --> 19:44.892
The others...

19:45.934 --> 19:47.102
Did they make it out?

19:47.144 --> 19:48.228
Yeah.

19:49.396 --> 19:51.273
Yeah. It's just us in here.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.650
But don't worry.
I'm gonna dig us out, okay?

19:53.692 --> 19:55.569
[dull rumbling]

20:00.991 --> 20:04.620
We ran your DNA against
the most recent victim,
Ms. Cooper.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.205
And it wasn't a match.

20:06.246 --> 20:08.790
So, it's not Polly, again.

20:08.832 --> 20:13.503
No, but the body parts were
a match to Lynette Fields.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.423
Oh, my God. Squeaky.

20:16.465 --> 20:20.636
There is more, I'm afraid.
Your DNA did come back
as a match to another body.

20:21.553 --> 20:24.223
Your tongueless John Doe.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.934
The trucker? How can that be?

20:26.975 --> 20:29.811
It seems
he's your very distant cousin.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.773
What? No. That's impossible.

20:32.814 --> 20:36.693
All of the Coopers
are either...
dead or accounted for.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.445
What about your more
distant relatives?

20:38.487 --> 20:40.656
The Blossoms?

20:40.697 --> 20:43.450
There's one last thing.
When I was at my lab,

20:43.492 --> 20:45.244
the morgue was broken into.

20:46.161 --> 20:47.829
The body of the John Doe

20:47.871 --> 20:51.124
and the severed limbs
of Lynette Fields were stolen.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.501
They're covering their tracks.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.127
They heard my mom on the news

20:54.169 --> 20:56.380
and they came here
to steal the evidence.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.382
It's just like when our
Mothman body was taken.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.217
Yes. Yes, it is.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.511
Nana Rose gave us that Mothman
that was stolen,

21:02.552 --> 21:06.056
and now your prime suspect
tests positive for Blossom DNA.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.100
Lerman was held captive
by a Mothman

21:08.141 --> 21:09.893
near the Lonely Highway.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.395
These two things are connected,
and their connection...

21:11.436 --> 21:12.980
Is the Blossoms.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.690
You two go.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.608
I'm gonna get in touch
with Squeaky's family.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.278
But, guys,

21:19.319 --> 21:21.613
when the time comes
to take these monsters down,

21:22.489 --> 21:23.365
I want in.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.328
[woman on radio]
Two miners, Archie Andrews
and Eric Jackson,

21:28.370 --> 21:29.913
both Army veterans,

21:29.955 --> 21:31.873
remain unaccounted for
after the mine collapse

21:31.915 --> 21:33.625
in Riverdale earlier today.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.711
-Relief efforts
are currently underway.
-[grunts]

21:35.752 --> 21:37.379
But the condition
of the miners
are not yet known.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.468
[Veronica] Oh, good.
You're awake.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.345
[Hiram groans softly]

21:45.387 --> 21:47.848
-Mija?
-Let's start with the obvious.

21:47.889 --> 21:49.599
I know you're behind
the mine explosion.

21:49.641 --> 21:50.600
Don't bother denying it.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.060
Untie me immediately!

21:53.520 --> 21:55.981
It's ironic, I keep hearing

21:56.023 --> 21:57.858
the words my guidance counselor
said to me

21:57.899 --> 21:59.234
way back in high school.

22:00.777 --> 22:03.071
That our sick dance of death

22:03.113 --> 22:06.074
could only end
with one of us dying.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.743
And now, here we are,

22:07.784 --> 22:10.329
headed straight
for an Oedipal tragedy

22:10.370 --> 22:12.247
set in motion when I was...

22:13.081 --> 22:14.666
a 14-year-old girl.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.501
Veronica, stop being
so dramatic.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.837
Oh, but this story
is dramatic, Daddy.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.840
The day of my quinceanera.

22:24.259 --> 22:25.218
[scoffs]

22:27.012 --> 22:28.513
It was supposed to be...

22:29.681 --> 22:32.976
the most important,

22:33.018 --> 22:35.354
celebratory day
of my young life.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.107
When I overheard you
in your study,

22:39.149 --> 22:41.485
talking with
some of your friends,

22:41.526 --> 22:43.445
telling them
I was a disappointment.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.825
That you wished
Mom had given you a son

22:48.867 --> 22:50.327
to follow in your footsteps.

22:52.704 --> 22:55.499
Oh. How nice.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.376
You remember.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.630
Do you know...

23:01.671 --> 23:05.050
what it does
to a 14-year-old girl...

23:06.635 --> 23:09.763
to hear that kind of dismissal
from her own father?

23:11.807 --> 23:15.227
I have spent an entire lifetime

23:15.268 --> 23:18.522
chasing your approval and love.
And for what?

23:20.023 --> 23:22.526
Sociopaths aren't
capable of love.

23:26.446 --> 23:27.531
[sobbing]

23:29.032 --> 23:30.117
[sniffles]

23:30.617 --> 23:31.827
[exhales]

23:31.868 --> 23:33.662
Which is why

23:33.703 --> 23:35.705
I want to be very clear
with you right now.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.751
If Archie dies,

23:40.460 --> 23:41.336
you die.

23:44.506 --> 23:45.465
[chuckles softly]

23:49.261 --> 23:50.637
Can you feel it, Daddy?

23:52.180 --> 23:56.685
Our dance of death
is finally coming to an end.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.063
[Jughead] Hey, Nana.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.314
We need to talk to you
about the Mothmen, remember?

24:01.356 --> 24:02.774
I've told you what I know.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.696
[Betty] Look at me.
Look right at me.

24:07.737 --> 24:12.659
Right now, young women,
including my sister,

24:12.701 --> 24:15.245
who was a member
of your family,

24:15.287 --> 24:17.164
are being abducted,

24:18.123 --> 24:19.916
tortured, and murdered.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.878
So, focus

24:22.919 --> 24:26.214
and answer our questions.

24:26.256 --> 24:30.427
Right. You gave my friend
and I a corpse inside
a maple barrel.

24:31.970 --> 24:32.888
Who was it?

24:33.680 --> 24:35.307
The truth, Nana.

24:35.348 --> 24:39.144
I'm ashamed to admit it.
It was Cousin Timothy.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.521
I came across his corpse
in the woods

24:41.563 --> 24:45.025
after he passed,
and I put him in a barrel.

24:45.066 --> 24:47.819
Poor Timothy. He was born with
so many defects--

24:47.861 --> 24:49.488
Okay. Cousin Timothy?

24:49.529 --> 24:51.198
This... this is
a blood relative of yours?

24:51.239 --> 24:53.408
My late husband

24:53.450 --> 24:56.328
was a compulsive philanderer.

24:56.369 --> 24:59.623
He made the beast
with every woman who worked
on our estate.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.042
The maids,
the cooks, the nannies.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.960
And then when they
swelled with child,

25:04.002 --> 25:07.797
he forced me to pawn them off
to avoid a scandal.

25:07.839 --> 25:11.092
But I knew a barren couple

25:11.134 --> 25:13.178
who lived in a cabin
in the woods.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.763
The Starkweathers.

25:14.804 --> 25:16.473
I gave the children to them.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.558
How many children in total?

25:18.600 --> 25:22.270
Oh, over the years,
half a dozen.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.523
The trucker that I caught,
the one who bit off his tongue,

25:24.564 --> 25:27.317
he must have been one of them.
A Starkweather.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.570
A Blossom, dear. In part.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.155
[Jughead] Nana.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.115
You're... you're saying

25:34.157 --> 25:36.201
there is a secret,

25:36.243 --> 25:38.662
illegitimate clan of Blossoms

25:38.703 --> 25:43.250
that have lived in the woods
for two generations?

25:43.291 --> 25:45.293
Why did you
call the corpse a Mothman?

25:45.335 --> 25:47.128
The family kept to themselves.

25:47.170 --> 25:50.257
Didn't like eyes prying
into their business.

25:50.298 --> 25:53.468
So, they created a fiction.

25:54.094 --> 25:56.263
The Mothmen.

25:56.304 --> 25:59.641
One which we Blossoms were
all too eager to embrace.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.103
Do they still live
in the woods?

26:03.144 --> 26:06.314
Oh, my, no. They migrated
from the there to the mines.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.191
And then,
when that closed down,

26:08.233 --> 26:09.901
they moved closer
to the highway.

26:11.820 --> 26:15.073
Who else has been propagating
the Mothmen idea for decades,

26:15.115 --> 26:17.075
right in plain sight,
right off the highway?

26:17.117 --> 26:19.369
Old Man Dreyfuss.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.998
Yes! Dreyfuss
Starkweather, yes.

26:23.039 --> 26:24.124
Is he still alive?

26:24.165 --> 26:25.250
Oh, my God, Jug.

26:25.292 --> 26:26.960
You and I have both been there.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.254
Polly could've been there
right under our noses.

26:29.296 --> 26:30.589
[cell phone chimes]

26:32.173 --> 26:34.092
It's Toni.
She said there's an emergency.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.639
[indistinct chatter]

26:49.190 --> 26:50.734
[Archie coughing]

26:55.238 --> 26:56.281
[coughs]

27:00.535 --> 27:01.703
[straining]

27:03.204 --> 27:04.914
[panting]

27:10.545 --> 27:12.297
[coughing]

27:12.339 --> 27:13.923
-Are you still
with me, Jackson?
-[Jackson coughing]

27:15.925 --> 27:17.844
How we doing, Sarge?

27:17.886 --> 27:21.473
Not great. We're losing
a lot of oxygen.

27:22.766 --> 27:23.808
And a lot of blood.

27:24.392 --> 27:25.935
[coughing]

27:29.147 --> 27:32.942
I'm gonna be honest with you,
I have no idea how we're
gonna get out of there.

27:32.984 --> 27:34.986
[Bingo] You don't
really believe that,
do you, Sergeant?

27:39.574 --> 27:40.533
Bingo.

27:42.577 --> 27:44.287
I thought we were square.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.872
Apparently not.

27:45.914 --> 27:48.458
Apparently you need a kick
in the ass.

27:48.500 --> 27:52.170
You remember back at basic,
during our first PT test,

27:52.212 --> 27:55.715
you did double
the number of push-ups
or pull-ups as any other guy?

27:55.757 --> 27:58.051
You don't have
an ounce of quit in you!

27:59.469 --> 28:01.596
Bingo, I'm only one man.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.139
All due respect, Sarge,

28:04.182 --> 28:06.142
no, you're not.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.728
Come on, guys, double-time.

28:08.770 --> 28:12.023
Let's help the Sergeant
get him and Corporal Jackson
out of here.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.775
[footsteps marching]

28:22.325 --> 28:23.827
Britta ran away last night.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.162
[sighing] Her mom called
to see if she was here.

28:26.204 --> 28:29.416
They got in a fight, and when
her mom went to check on her,
she was gone.

28:29.457 --> 28:32.419
She left a note saying,
"Now you don't have
to deal with me."

28:32.460 --> 28:35.505
Did Britta give any indication
as to where she might've gone?

28:35.547 --> 28:38.133
We called all her friends,
no one knows anything.

28:38.174 --> 28:40.176
Well, if there's even a chance
that she's trying
to get out of Riverdale

28:40.218 --> 28:41.636
using the Lonely Highway,

28:41.678 --> 28:43.555
then we need to go
to that junkyard ASAP.

28:43.596 --> 28:44.723
Wait, you know where
the Highway Killer is?

28:44.764 --> 28:46.891
Killers. Yeah, we think.

28:46.933 --> 28:48.685
But we need a team
to go in with us.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.687
I wanna come.
Fangs, you stay here

28:50.729 --> 28:52.439
with Baby Anthony
in case Britta comes back.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.607
-Is that okay?
-Um, not really.

28:54.649 --> 28:58.027
No, Toni. You're a mother now.

28:58.069 --> 29:00.488
You just can't go out
on crazy raids anymore--

29:00.530 --> 29:04.117
I have to, Fangs,
Britta came to me for help,

29:04.159 --> 29:05.785
and I saw myself in her.

29:05.827 --> 29:07.746
And as for Baby Anthony,

29:07.787 --> 29:09.789
I don't want him
to grow up and think that
his mom was a coward,

29:09.831 --> 29:13.251
and that I didn't do
everything I could
to help somebody in need.

29:13.293 --> 29:16.045
And besides,
there's nobody better
to take care of him than you.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.922
Than my mom, you mean,

29:17.964 --> 29:21.468
'cause if you're
going on this raid,
then I'm going with you.

29:21.509 --> 29:22.886
I'm gonna be
watching your back,

29:22.927 --> 29:24.345
and that's not up
for discussion.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.014
Well, how about we
watch each other's backs?

29:26.055 --> 29:27.015
[crackling]

29:27.766 --> 29:28.767
Deal.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.812
Cheryl, any luck finding
a first aid kit in here?

29:32.854 --> 29:34.397
I'm looking, sit down.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.319
Veronica, you're stressed,
you're injured.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.654
You need to take a break.
Or at least go home,

29:41.696 --> 29:43.823
-get cleaned up.
-I can't go home.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.366
Archie's trapped in a mine.

29:45.408 --> 29:47.869
I know, but you will want
to be your gorgeous self

29:47.911 --> 29:49.704
when Orpheus emerges
from the underworld,

29:49.746 --> 29:52.582
and probably not
with an infected hand.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.125
Trust me, go get refreshed,

29:54.167 --> 29:56.085
and I'll hold down
the fort here.

29:56.127 --> 29:59.297
And not to worry.
I've got some serious backup.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.050
I call upon fire.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.803
Which consumed
my brother's body

30:04.844 --> 30:07.055
and mighty Thornhill
once upon a time.

30:07.096 --> 30:08.640
I call upon wind,

30:08.681 --> 30:10.308
as I have once before.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.810
[wind blowing]

30:11.851 --> 30:12.936
Blow a cool gust

30:12.977 --> 30:13.937
across Archie's brow.

30:17.607 --> 30:19.025
I call upon water,

30:19.067 --> 30:20.360
where I saw my departed brother

30:20.401 --> 30:22.403
in the icy depths
of Sweetwater River,

30:22.445 --> 30:27.116
and where I, myself,
was reborn.

30:27.158 --> 30:28.243
And lastly...

30:29.744 --> 30:31.162
I call upon the Earth.

30:32.038 --> 30:33.665
[straining]

30:33.706 --> 30:36.584
Dear Gaia, please return
Archie and Eric to us.

30:36.626 --> 30:38.253
Open a path for them

30:38.294 --> 30:40.755
so that they may return
to the land of the living.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.424
[water running]

31:02.485 --> 31:03.528
[door creaks]

31:09.450 --> 31:11.202
[heavy creaking]

31:52.869 --> 31:55.705
Pippi, turns off all the lights
in the apartment.

31:56.956 --> 31:57.832
[gasps softly]

31:58.958 --> 32:01.878
Pippi, play Wagner.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.212
Full volume.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.965
["Ride of the Valkyries"
playing]

32:18.728 --> 32:19.896
[door creaks]

32:20.855 --> 32:21.731
[gun fires]

32:25.944 --> 32:27.070
[both grunting]

32:33.910 --> 32:34.911
Miss Veronica?

32:34.953 --> 32:37.038
-[gunshots]
-[gasps]

32:37.080 --> 32:39.958
Oh, my goodness.
Pippi, lights on. Music off.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.084
[music stops]

32:41.125 --> 32:42.335
Miss Veronica.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.047
What happened?

32:46.089 --> 32:47.548
[sighs] Chad broke in...

32:48.841 --> 32:49.926
and attacked me.

32:52.553 --> 32:53.805
[cell phone ringing]

32:53.846 --> 32:55.014
Oh.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.102
Cheryl, any news?

33:04.190 --> 33:06.651
-[door closes]
-Came to finish the job?

33:09.112 --> 33:11.698
I can't tell you how tempting
that proposition is.

33:12.907 --> 33:14.450
Then again,

33:14.492 --> 33:16.369
I've already
seen blood spilt today.

33:17.704 --> 33:18.621
Besides...

33:19.831 --> 33:22.291
unlike you, I stick to my word.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.377
I told you you'd die
if Archie did.

33:25.211 --> 33:26.170
Well...

33:27.130 --> 33:28.840
he didn't, Daddy.

33:29.966 --> 33:32.301
Archie is alive,

33:32.343 --> 33:35.763
above ground,
and waiting for me.

33:35.805 --> 33:39.600
You failed
yet again. [chuckles]

33:39.642 --> 33:42.145
You literally dropped
a mountain on Archie

33:42.186 --> 33:44.313
and still couldn't kill him.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.190
You know...

33:47.358 --> 33:48.776
I used to admire you...

33:49.694 --> 33:50.653
grudgingly...

33:51.904 --> 33:52.864
but I did.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.743
But now you're just this...

33:57.535 --> 33:58.786
silly cartoon.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.374
[knife slashes]

34:03.416 --> 34:04.834
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.046
'Cause you're
no longer a threat to me.

34:08.087 --> 34:12.133
But if you ever come after me
or Archie again,

34:12.175 --> 34:14.385
you'll end up getting shot.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.637
Just like Chad did today.

34:16.679 --> 34:19.223
-What?
-Call Dr. Curdle
for the details.

34:20.349 --> 34:21.434
Bye, you little bitch.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.688
As we discussed, Jughead,
you're gonna distract Dreyfuss

34:25.730 --> 34:28.107
while the rest of us
search the junkyard.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.318
If Britta is being kept
in the same place that
my sister and Lerman were held,

34:30.359 --> 34:33.571
we're looking for some kind
of windowless shed.

34:33.613 --> 34:35.031
You know how to use a stun gun?

34:35.073 --> 34:36.407
I'm from Chicago.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.950
-Yes.
-[Toni] Jughead? You good?

34:39.202 --> 34:41.537
-I'm good.
-We're ready then?

34:41.579 --> 34:45.208
Jug, you're up. The rest of us,
let's split up so we can
cover more ground, okay?

34:45.249 --> 34:46.459
[knocking at door]

34:49.337 --> 34:50.296
You again.

34:50.338 --> 34:51.672
Hey, Mr. Dreyfuss.

34:51.714 --> 34:53.758
I'm so sorry
to drop by unannounced.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.343
I, uh... I actually just
got back into town.

34:55.384 --> 34:56.886
I was hoping that
you and I could

34:56.928 --> 34:58.888
continue our conversation
about the Mothmen.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.765
Let me grab some moonshine.

35:00.807 --> 35:03.768
Actually, it's a little cold.
Do you mind if we talk inside?

35:05.853 --> 35:07.021
Don't mind the mess.

35:15.988 --> 35:18.950
-Live here alone?
-Yep. Just me.

35:19.784 --> 35:22.078
No family, huh?

35:22.120 --> 35:25.706
I thought we were
gonna discuss the Mothmen.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.333
But they are your family.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.544
Aren't they, Mr. Starkweather?

35:32.171 --> 35:34.590
You know, I wondered if we were
gonna have trouble with you.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.596
How much have you figured out?

35:40.638 --> 35:42.348
[Jughead] Not all of it.

35:42.390 --> 35:43.599
Do you mind
if I take a stab at it?

35:44.225 --> 35:45.685
Be my guest.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.687
[Jughead] The Mothman corpse

35:47.728 --> 35:49.939
we had at Pop's,

35:49.981 --> 35:53.943
that was, uh, Timothy,
your half-brother.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.695
You were the one that took it.

35:55.736 --> 35:57.697
You must have overheard
Tabitha and I talking about it

35:57.738 --> 35:59.115
when you came
to pick up your regular

35:59.157 --> 36:01.200
Thursday night order
of pork chops.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.369
And you did. We have receipts.

36:03.411 --> 36:04.704
You were also the person
that stole the bodies

36:04.745 --> 36:05.663
from the morgue.

36:07.623 --> 36:09.709
There was another brother.

36:09.750 --> 36:13.504
Swallowed his own tongue
just to keep your secret.

36:13.546 --> 36:16.048
Which is what,
to your thinking?

36:16.090 --> 36:19.302
[Jughead] That you
and your inbred brothers

36:19.343 --> 36:22.513
drive up and down
the Lonely Highway searching
for women to murder.

36:24.056 --> 36:26.058
Lerman, he was an outlier,

36:26.100 --> 36:28.436
because it's women
that you're after.

36:28.477 --> 36:30.229
-[rustling]
-[gasps softly]

36:30.271 --> 36:31.564
[Jughead] Why?

36:31.606 --> 36:33.482
[Dreyfuss] To survive.

36:33.524 --> 36:35.067
So we started going after

36:35.109 --> 36:38.487
the people that
no one would miss.

36:38.529 --> 36:39.488
Runaways

36:40.615 --> 36:43.242
and sex workers, drug addicts.

36:43.284 --> 36:45.620
[Jughead] To what,
steal from them?

36:45.661 --> 36:47.663
Those people couldn't have
had much money.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.582
You're right, of course.

36:49.624 --> 36:52.001
But we don't need
much to survive.

36:52.043 --> 36:55.630
Anyway, after a while,
it wasn't about that.

36:57.256 --> 36:58.716
It was about--

36:58.758 --> 36:59.675
The hunt.

37:01.093 --> 37:02.136
The sport of it all?

37:03.095 --> 37:05.056
Yep.

37:05.097 --> 37:06.182
[Jughead] So the Mothmen story,
that was just a cover up?

37:06.224 --> 37:07.558
[gasping]

37:07.600 --> 37:09.727
[Jughead]
Just a spooky little tale

37:09.769 --> 37:12.647
to keep people away from
all the disappearances
on the highway.

37:12.688 --> 37:15.149
And if someone goes
missing, then...

37:15.191 --> 37:17.068
maybe they were taken up
in an alien spaceship.

37:18.819 --> 37:20.780
People believe
what they want to believe.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.574
Nobody cared about those girls.

37:24.450 --> 37:25.368
Oh.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.120
You are so wrong about that.

37:28.871 --> 37:30.206
[door rattling]

37:30.248 --> 37:32.416
-[Toni] Britta?
-[Britta] Ms. Topaz?

37:32.458 --> 37:33.793
Okay, I'm gonna get you out,
hold on.

37:34.335 --> 37:35.253
[screams]

37:40.091 --> 37:41.259
-[trap clangs]
-[Fogarty groans]

37:47.473 --> 37:48.891
[Fogarty grunts]

37:50.559 --> 37:52.478
Betty? [screams]

37:59.485 --> 38:00.653
[Tabitha screams]

38:08.119 --> 38:10.246
Wanna test that armor against
a point-blank shotgun blast?

38:12.415 --> 38:14.083
[panting]

38:14.125 --> 38:15.126
Didn't think so.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.090
-[crackling]
-[grunts]

38:26.178 --> 38:27.138
[gasping]

38:30.182 --> 38:31.976
-[groans]
-[Toni grunts]

38:32.727 --> 38:34.145
[Betty gasps]

38:34.186 --> 38:35.688
Betty, are you okay?

38:35.730 --> 38:37.523
[gasping] I heard you scream.
What happened?

38:37.565 --> 38:39.608
I found Britta. She's fine.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.277
Scared, but fine.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.737
Remember what you told us
about Lerman,

38:42.778 --> 38:45.489
how a Mothman helped
him escape?

38:45.531 --> 38:49.702
Well, apparently
not all Starkweathers
are evil incarnate.

38:49.744 --> 38:50.953
[Betty breathlessly]
Hi, Britta.

38:54.081 --> 38:55.833
[loud crash in distance]

38:55.875 --> 38:56.959
Oh, my God, Jughead.

38:58.544 --> 38:59.754
[Dreyfuss grunting]

39:00.963 --> 39:02.673
[Betty] Are you okay?

39:02.715 --> 39:04.467
Yeah. No, I'm fine.
He tried to chew
his tongue off

39:04.508 --> 39:06.344
and choke on it.
But not before
he answers our questions.

39:06.385 --> 39:08.429
Your hunting days are over,
you sick--

39:12.141 --> 39:13.684
How does it feel?

39:13.726 --> 39:16.812
My foot? Like it's on fire.

39:16.854 --> 39:19.398
The rest of me?
Like a complete ass.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.651
Well, who would've known
we were walking into
The Hills Have Eyes?

39:22.693 --> 39:23.652
Toni...

39:26.364 --> 39:27.406
we can do this.

39:28.449 --> 39:29.367
Right?

39:31.118 --> 39:32.119
Like, all of this.

39:33.704 --> 39:37.375
Oh, yeah. We got this.

39:37.416 --> 39:39.085
You and me just...

39:40.086 --> 39:41.712
watching each other's backs.

39:48.177 --> 39:49.553
[Veronica sighs in relief]

39:49.595 --> 39:52.223
Not even the Earth
swallowing you whole

39:52.264 --> 39:54.600
could keep us
from this moment, Archiekins.

39:56.602 --> 40:00.064
Another brush with death to add
to your ever-growing list.

40:01.357 --> 40:03.943
Your guardian angel
deserves a raise.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.319
More than one, Ronnie.

40:22.461 --> 40:24.422
[Betty] Mr. Starkweather,

40:24.463 --> 40:26.340
I've spoken to my colleagues
at the FBI,

40:26.382 --> 40:27.716
and they'll be here soon
to take you

40:27.758 --> 40:29.301
and your brothers away.

40:30.845 --> 40:32.346
But before that happens...

40:34.640 --> 40:36.350
I would very much appreciate it

40:36.392 --> 40:38.727
if you would tell me
where my sister is.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.067
[softly] Please tell me.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.117
She's in the junkyard.

40:55.077 --> 40:56.454
I can draw you a map.

40:58.914 --> 41:00.583
[somber music playing]
